in

the
following
history
is
related
by
those
who
know
it
as
something
funny
as
one
of
the
best
jokes
that
ever
occurred
in
a
district
devoted
to
jokes
and
i
too
have
hitherto
regarded
it
as
such
but
upon
my
soul
now
that
i
come
to
write
it
down
it
strikes
me
as
being
after
all
a
pretty
grim
tragedy
however
you
shall
judge
and
laugh
or
cry
as
you
please
it
began
in
the
little
house
of
mrs
carpole
up
at
bleakridge
on
the
hill
between
bursley
and
hanbridge
mrs
carpole
was
the
second
mrs
carpole
and
her
husband
was
dead
she
had
a
stepson
horace
and
a
son
of
her
own
sidney
horace
is
the
hero
or
the
villain
of
the
history
on
the
day
when
the
unfortunate
affair
began
he
was
nineteen
years
old
and
a
model
youth
not
only
was
he
getting
on
in
business
not
only
did
he
give
half
his
evenings
to
the
study
of
the
chemistry
of
pottery
and
the
other
half
to
various
secretaryships
in
connection
with
the
wesleyan
methodist
chapel
and
not
only
did
he
save
money
not
only
was
he
a
comfort
to
his
stepmother
and
a
sort
of
uncle
to
sidney
not
only
was
he
an
early
riser
a
total
abstainer
a
and
a
good
listener
but
in
addition
to
the
practice
of
these
manifold
and
rare
virtues
he
found
time
even
at
that
tender
age
to
pay
his
tailor
bill
promptly
and
to
fold
his
trousers
in
the
same
crease
every
night
so
that
he
always
looked
neat
and
dignified
strange
to
say
he
made
no
friends
perhaps
he
was
just
a
thought
too
perfect
for
a
district
like
the
five
towns
a
sin
or
so
might
have
endeared
him
to
the
entire
neighbourhood
perhaps
his
loneliness
was
due
to
his
imperfect
sense
of
humour
or
perhaps
to
the
dull
unsmiling
heaviness
of
his
somewhat
flat
features
sidney
was
quite
a
different
story
sidney
to
use
his
mother
phrase
was
a
little
jockey
his
years
were
then
eight
and
as
most
little
jockeys
are
he
had
a
smile
and
a
scowl
that
were
equally
effective
in
tyrannizing
over
both
his
mother
and
horace
and
he
was
beloved
by
everybody
women
turned
to
look
at
him
in
the
street
unhappily
his
health
was
not
good
he
was
afflicted
by
a
slight
deafness
which
however
the
doctor
said
he
would
grow
out
of
the
doctor
predicted
for
him
a
lusty
manhood
in
the
meantime
he
caught
every
disease
that
happened
to
be
about
and
nearly
died
of
each
one
his
latest
acquisition
had
been
scarlet
fever
now
one
afternoon
after
he
had
and
his
room
had
been
disinfected
and
he
was
beginning
to
walk
again
horace
came
home
and
decided
that
sidney
should
be
brought
downstairs
for
tea
as
a
treat
to
celebrate
his
convalescence
and
that
he
horace
would
carry
him
downstairs
mrs
carpole
was
delighted
with
the
idea
and
sidney
also
except
that
sidney
did
not
want
to
be
carried
downstairs
he
wanted
to
walk
down
think
it
will
be
better
for
him
to
walk
horace
dear
said
mrs
carpole
in
her
thin
plaintive
voice
can
quite
well
and
you
know
how
clumsy
you
are
supposing
you
were
to
fall
horace
nevertheless
in
pursuance
of
his
programme
of
being
uncle
to
sidney
was
determined
to
carry
sidney
and
carry
sidney
he
did
despite
warnings
and
kickings
at
least
he
carried
him
as
far
as
the
turn
in
the
steep
stairs
at
which
point
he
fell
just
as
his
stepmother
had
feared
and
sidney
with
him
the
arrived
on
the
ground
floor
in
company
but
horace
with
his
eleven
stone
two
was
on
top
and
the
poor
suffering
little
convalescent
lay
moveless
and
insensible
it
took
the
doctor
forty
minutes
to
bring
him
to
and
all
the
time
the
odour
of
grilled
herrings
which
formed
part
of
the
uneaten
tea
made
itself
felt
through
the
house
like
a
satanic
comment
on
the
spectacle
of
human
life
the
scene
was
dreadful
at
first
the
agony
then
passed
there
were
no
bruises
on
the
boy
not
a
mark
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
seemed
to
be
perfectly
himself
horace
breathed
again
and
thanked
heaven
it
was
no
worse
his
gratitude
to
heaven
was
however
slightly
premature
for
in
the
black
middle
of
the
night
poor
sidney
was
seized
with
excruciating
pains
in
the
head
and
the
doctor
lost
four
sleep
these
pains
returned
at
intervals
of
a
few
days
and
naturally
the
child
convalescence
was
retarded
then
horace
said
that
airs
carpole
should
take
sidney
to
buxton
for
a
fortnight
and
he
paid
all
the
expenses
of
the
trip
out
of
his
savings
he
was
desolated
utterly
stricken
he
said
he
should
never
forgive
himself
sidney
improved
slowly
ii
after
several
months
during
which
horace
had
given
up
all
his
limited
spare
time
to
the
superintendence
of
the
child
first
steps
in
knowledge
sidney
was
judged
to
be
sufficiently
strong
to
go
to
school
and
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
attend
the
endowed
school
at
the
wedgwood
institution
horace
accompanied
him
thither
on
the
opening
day
of
the
term
it
was
an
inclement
morning
in
january
and
left
the
young
delicate
sprig
apparently
joyous
and
content
to
the
care
of
his
masters
and
the
mercy
of
his
companions
but
sidney
came
home
for
dinner
weeping
weeping
in
spite
of
his
new
cap
his
new
satchel
his
new
box
of
compasses
and
his
new
books
his
mother
kept
him
at
home
in
the
afternoon
and
by
the
evening
another
of
those
terrible
attacks
had
supervened
the
doctor
and
horace
and
mrs
carpole
once
more
lost
much
precious
sleep
the
mysterious
malady
continued
school
was
out
of
the
question
and
when
sidney
took
the
air
in
charge
of
his
mother
everybody
stopped
to
sympathize
with
him
and
to
stroke
his
curls
and
call
him
a
poor
dear
and
also
to
commiserate
mrs
carpole
as
for
horace
bursley
tried
to
feel
sorry
for
horace
but
it
only
succeeded
in
showing
horace
that
it
was
hiding
a
sentiment
of
indignation
against
him
each
friendly
face
as
it
passed
horace
in
the
street
said
without
words
goes
the
youth
who
probably
ruined
his
young
stepbrother
life
and
through
sheer
obstinacy
too
he
dropped
the
little
darling
in
spite
of
warnings
and
protests
and
then
fell
on
the
top
of
him
of
course
he
did
do
it
on
purpose
but
the
doctor
mentioned
greatorex
of
manchester
the
celebrated
brain
specialist
and
horace
took
sidney
to
manchester
they
had
to
wait
an
hour
and
a
quarter
to
see
greatorex
his
in
john
dalton
street
being
crowded
with
imperfect
brains
but
their
turn
came
at
last
and
they
found
themselves
in
greatorex
presence
greatorex
was
a
fat
man
with
the
voice
of
a
thin
man
who
seemed
to
spend
the
whole
of
his
career
in
the
care
of
his
fingernails
my
little
fellow
said
greatorex
cry
for
sidney
was
already
crying
and
then
to
horace
in
a
curt
tone
is
it
and
horace
was
obliged
to
humiliate
himself
and
relate
the
accident
in
detail
together
with
all
that
had
subsequently
happened
yes
yes
yes
greatorex
would
punctuate
the
recital
and
when
tired
of
he
would
say
hum
hum
hum
when
he
had
said
times
he
suddenly
remarked
that
his
fee
was
three
guineas
and
told
horace
to
strengthen
sidney
all
he
could
not
to
work
him
too
hard
and
to
bring
him
back
in
a
year
time
horace
paid
the
money
greatorex
emitted
a
final
and
then
the
stepbrothers
were
whisked
out
by
an
expeditious
footman
the
experience
cost
horace
over
four
pounds
and
the
loss
of
a
day
time
and
the
worst
was
that
sidney
had
a
violent
attack
that
very
night
school
being
impossible
for
him
sidney
had
intermittent
instruction
from
professors
of
both
sexes
at
home
but
he
learnt
practically
nothing
except
the
banjo
horace
had
to
buy
him
a
banjo
it
cost
the
best
part
of
a
note
still
horace
could
do
no
less
stature
grew
rapidly
his
general
health
certainly
improved
yet
not
completely
he
always
had
a
fragile
interesting
air
moreover
his
deafness
did
not
disappear
there
were
occasions
when
it
was
extremely
pronounced
and
he
was
never
quite
safe
from
these
attacks
in
the
head
he
spent
a
month
or
six
weeks
each
year
in
the
expensive
bracing
atmosphere
of
some
seaside
resort
and
altogether
he
was
decidedly
a
heavy
drain
on
horace
resources
people
were
aware
of
this
and
they
said
that
horace
ought
to
be
happy
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
spend
money
freely
on
his
poor
brother
had
not
the
doctor
predicted
before
the
catastrophe
due
to
horace
culpable
negligence
that
sidney
would
grow
into
a
strong
man
and
that
his
deafness
would
leave
him
the
truth
was
one
never
knew
the
end
of
those
accidents
in
infancy
further
was
not
sidney
sad
condition
slowly
killing
his
mother
it
was
whispered
about
that
since
the
disaster
sidney
had
not
been
quite
sound
mentally
was
not
the
mere
suspicion
of
this
enough
to
kill
any
mother
and
as
a
fact
mrs
carpole
did
die
she
died
of
quinsy
doubtless
aggravated
by
sidney
sad
condition
not
long
afterwards
horace
came
into
a
small
fortune
from
his
maternal
grandfather
but
poor
sidney
did
not
come
into
any
fortune
and
people
somehow
illogically
inferred
that
horace
had
not
behaved
quite
nicely
in
coming
into
a
fortune
while
his
suffering
invalid
brother
whom
he
had
so
deeply
harmed
came
into
nothing
even
horace
had
compunctions
due
to
the
visitations
of
a
similar
idea
and
with
part
of
the
fortune
he
bought
a
house
with
a
large
garden
up
at
toft
end
the
highest
hill
of
the
hilly
five
towns
so
that
sidney
might
have
the
benefit
of
the
air
he
also
engaged
a
housekeeper
and
servants
with
the
remainder
of
the
fortune
he
obtained
a
partnership
in
the
firm
of
earthenware
manufacturers
for
whom
he
had
been
acting
as
manager
sidney
reached
the
age
of
eighteen
and
was
most
effective
to
look
upon
his
bright
hair
being
still
curly
and
his
eyes
a
wondrous
blue
and
his
form
elegant
and
the
question
of
sidney
future
arose
his
health
was
steadily
on
the
up
grade
the
deafness
had
quite
disappeared
he
had
inclinations
towards
art
and
had
already
amused
himself
by
painting
some
beautiful
vases
so
it
was
settled
that
he
should
enter
horace
works
on
the
art
side
with
a
view
to
becoming
ultimately
art
director
horace
gave
him
three
pounds
a
week
in
order
that
he
might
feel
perfectly
independent
and
to
the
same
end
sidney
paid
horace
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
but
the
change
of
life
upset
the
youth
health
again
after
only
two
visits
to
the
works
he
had
a
grave
recurrence
of
the
and
he
was
solemnly
exhorted
not
to
apply
himself
too
closely
to
business
he
therefore
took
several
a
week
and
sometimes
a
whole
one
and
even
when
he
put
in
one
of
his
full
days
he
would
arrive
at
the
works
three
hours
after
horace
and
restore
the
balance
by
leaving
an
hour
earlier
the
entire
town
watched
over
him
as
a
mother
watches
over
a
son
the
notion
that
he
was
not
quite
right
in
the
pate
gradually
died
away
and
everybody
was
thankful
for
that
though
it
was
feared
an
untimely
grave
might
be
his
portion
iii
she
was
a
nice
girl
the
nicest
girl
that
horace
had
ever
met
with
because
her
charming
niceness
included
a
faculty
of
being
really
serious
about
serious
things
and
yet
she
could
be
deliciously
gay
in
short
she
was
a
revelation
to
horace
and
her
name
was
ella
and
she
had
come
one
year
to
spend
some
weeks
with
mrs
penkethman
the
widowed
headmistress
of
the
wesleyan
day
school
who
was
her
cousin
mrs
penkethman
and
ella
had
been
holidaying
together
in
france
their
arrival
in
bursley
naturally
coincided
with
the
reopening
of
the
school
in
august
for
the
autumn
term
now
at
this
period
horace
was
rather
lonely
in
his
large
house
and
garden
for
sidney
in
pursuit
of
health
had
gone
off
on
a
six
cruise
round
holland
finland
norway
and
sweden
in
one
of
those
atlantic
liners
which
translated
like
enoch
without
dying
become
in
their
old
age
with
fine
names
apt
to
lead
to
confusion
with
the
private
yacht
of
the
tsar
of
russia
horace
had
offered
him
the
trip
and
horace
was
also
paying
his
weekly
salary
as
usual
so
horace
who
had
always
been
friendly
with
mrs
penkethman
grew
now
more
than
ever
friendly
with
mrs
penkethman
and
mrs
penkethman
and
ella
were
inseparable
the
few
aristocrats
left
in
bursley
in
september
remarked
that
horace
knew
what
he
was
about
as
it
was
notorious
that
ella
had
the
most
solid
expectations
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
horace
did
not
know
what
he
was
about
and
he
never
once
thought
of
expectations
he
was
simply
as
they
say
in
bursley
knocked
silly
by
ella
he
honestly
imagined
her
to
be
the
wonderfullest
woman
on
the
earth
surface
with
her
dark
eyes
and
her
expressive
sympathetic
gestures
and
her
alterations
of
seriousness
and
gaiety
it
astounded
him
that
a
girl
of
could
have
thought
so
deeply
upon
life
as
she
had
the
inexplicable
thing
was
that
she
looked
up
to
him
she
evidently
admired
him
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
she
was
quite
wrong
about
him
much
too
kind
in
her
estimate
of
him
that
really
he
was
a
very
ordinary
man
indeed
but
another
instinct
prevented
him
from
thus
undeceiving
her
and
one
saturday
afternoon
the
season
being
late
september
horace
actually
got
those
two
women
up
to
tea
in
his
house
and
garden
he
had
not
dared
to
dream
of
such
bliss
he
had
hesitated
long
before
asking
them
to
come
and
in
asking
them
he
had
blushed
and
stammered
the
invitation
had
seemed
to
him
to
savour
of
audacity
but
bless
you
they
had
accepted
with
apparent
ecstasy
they
gave
him
to
think
that
they
had
genuinely
wanted
to
come
and
they
came
dressed
visions
lilies
of
the
field
and
as
the
day
was
quite
warm
tea
was
served
in
the
garden
and
everybody
admired
the
view
and
there
was
no
restraint
no
awkwardness
in
particular
ella
talked
with
an
ease
and
a
distinction
that
enchanted
horace
and
almost
made
him
talk
with
ease
and
distinction
too
he
said
to
himself
that
seeing
he
had
only
known
her
a
month
he
was
getting
on
amazingly
he
said
to
himself
that
his
good
luck
passed
belief
then
there
was
a
sound
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
and
presently
horace
heard
the
housekeeper
complimenting
sidney
on
his
good
looks
and
sidney
asking
the
housekeeper
to
lend
him
three
shillings
to
pay
the
cabman
the
golden
youth
had
returned
without
the
slightest
warning
from
his
cruise
the
tea
trio
at
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
saw
him
standing
in
the
porch
tanned
curly
graceful
and
young
horace
half
rose
and
then
sat
down
again
ella
stared
hard
must
be
your
brother
she
said
that
sid
horace
answered
and
then
calling
out
loudly
down
here
sid
and
tell
them
to
bring
another
cup
and
saucer
you
are
old
man
sidney
shouted
see
i
back
what
mrs
penkethman
is
that
you
he
came
down
the
central
path
of
the
garden
like
a
narcissus
does
look
delicate
said
ella
under
her
breath
to
horace
tears
came
to
her
eyes
naturally
ella
knew
all
about
sidney
she
enjoyed
the
entire
confidence
of
mrs
penkethman
and
what
mrs
penkethman
did
know
of
the
private
history
of
the
upper
classes
in
bursley
did
not
amount
to
very
much
these
were
nearly
the
last
words
that
ella
spoke
to
horace
that
afternoon
the
introduction
was
made
and
sidney
slipped
into
the
party
as
comfortably
as
he
slipped
into
everything
like
a
candle
slipping
into
a
socket
but
nevertheless
ella
talked
no
more
she
just
stared
at
sidney
and
listened
to
him
horace
was
proud
that
sidney
had
made
such
an
impression
on
her
he
was
glad
that
she
showed
no
aversion
to
sidney
because
in
the
event
of
horace
marriage
where
would
sidney
live
if
not
with
horace
and
horace
wife
still
he
could
have
wished
that
ella
would
continue
to
display
her
conversational
powers
presently
sidney
lighted
a
cigarette
he
was
of
those
young
men
whose
delicate
mouths
seem
to
have
been
fashioned
for
the
nice
conduct
of
a
cigarette
and
he
had
a
way
of
blowing
out
the
smoke
that
secretly
ravished
every
feminine
beholder
horace
still
held
to
his
principles
but
he
envied
sidney
a
little
at
the
conclusion
of
the
festivity
these
two
women
naturally
could
not
be
permitted
to
walk
home
alone
and
naturally
also
the
four
could
not
walk
abreast
on
the
narrow
pavements
horace
went
first
with
mrs
penkethman
he
was
mad
with
anxiety
to
appropriate
ella
but
he
dared
not
it
would
not
have
been
quite
correct
it
would
have
been
as
they
say
in
bursley
too
thick
besides
there
was
the
question
of
age
horace
was
over
thirty
and
mrs
penkethman
was
also
over
thirty
whereas
sidney
was
and
so
was
ella
hence
sidney
walked
behind
with
ella
and
the
procession
started
in
silence
horace
did
not
look
round
too
often
that
would
not
have
been
quite
proper
but
whenever
he
did
look
round
the
other
couple
had
lagged
farther
and
farther
behind
and
ella
seemed
perfectly
to
have
recovered
her
speech
at
length
he
looked
round
and
lo
they
had
not
turned
the
last
corner
and
they
arrived
at
mrs
penkethman
cottage
at
hillport
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
their
elders
iv
the
wedding
cost
horace
a
large
sum
of
money
you
see
he
could
not
do
less
than
behave
handsomely
by
the
bride
owing
to
his
notorious
admiration
for
her
and
of
course
the
bridegroom
needed
setting
up
horace
practically
furnished
their
home
for
them
out
of
his
own
pocket
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
sidney
should
have
resources
further
sidney
as
a
single
man
paying
a
week
for
board
and
lodging
could
no
doubt
struggle
along
upon
three
pounds
weekly
but
sidney
as
a
husband
with
the
nicest
girl
in
the
world
to
take
care
of
and
to
pay
could
not
possibly
perform
the
same
feat
although
he
did
no
more
work
at
the
manufactory
horace
could
not
have
been
so
unbrotherly
as
to
demand
it
horace
paid
him
eight
pounds
a
week
instead
of
three
and
the
affair
cost
horace
a
good
deal
besides
money
but
what
could
horace
do
he
decidedly
would
not
have
wished
to
wreck
the
happiness
of
two
young
and
beautiful
lives
even
had
he
possessed
the
power
to
do
so
and
he
did
not
possess
the
power
those
two
did
not
consult
horace
before
falling
in
love
they
merely
fell
in
love
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
and
an
end
of
horace
too
horace
had
to
suffer
he
did
suffer
perhaps
it
was
for
his
highest
welfare
that
other
matters
came
to
monopolize
his
mind
one
sorrow
drives
out
another
if
you
sit
on
a
pin
you
are
apt
to
forget
that
you
have
the
toothache
the
earthenware
manufactory
was
not
going
well
plenty
of
business
was
being
done
but
not
at
the
right
prices
crushed
between
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
of
the
mckinley
tariff
and
german
competition
horace
in
company
with
other
manufacturers
was
breathing
out
his
life
blood
in
the
shape
of
capital
the
truth
was
that
he
had
never
had
enough
capital
he
had
heavily
mortgaged
the
house
at
toft
end
in
order
to
purchase
his
partners
shares
in
the
business
and
have
the
whole
undertaking
to
himself
and
he
profoundly
regretted
it
he
needed
every
penny
that
he
could
collect
the
strictest
economy
was
necessary
if
he
meant
to
survive
the
struggle
and
here
he
was
paying
eight
pounds
a
week
to
a
personage
purely
ornamental
after
having
squandered
hundreds
in
rendering
that
personage
comfortable
the
situation
was
dreadful
you
may
ask
why
did
he
not
explain
the
situation
to
sidney
well
partly
because
he
was
too
kind
and
partly
because
he
was
too
proud
and
partly
because
sidney
would
not
have
understood
horace
fought
on
keeping
up
a
position
in
the
town
and
hoping
that
miracles
would
occur
then
ella
expectations
were
realized
sidney
and
she
had
some
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
play
with
and
they
played
the
most
agreeable
games
but
not
in
bursley
no
they
left
horace
in
bursley
and
went
to
llandudno
for
a
spell
horace
envied
them
but
he
saw
them
off
at
the
station
as
an
elder
brother
should
and
tipped
the
porters
certainly
he
was
relieved
of
the
formality
of
paying
eight
pounds
a
week
to
his
brother
but
this
did
not
help
him
much
the
sad
fact
was
that
by
which
is
meant
fate
circumstances
credit
and
so
on
had
gone
too
far
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
eight
pounds
a
week
it
was
a
question
of
final
ruin
surely
he
might
have
borrowed
money
from
sidney
sidney
had
no
money
the
money
was
ella
and
horace
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
borrow
money
from
a
woman
from
ella
from
a
heavenly
creature
who
always
had
a
soothing
sympathetic
word
for
him
that
would
have
been
to
take
advantage
of
ella
no
if
you
suggest
such
a
thing
you
do
not
know
horace
i
stated
in
the
beginning
that
he
had
no
faults
he
was
therefore
absolutely
honest
and
he
called
his
creditors
together
while
he
could
yet
pay
them
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
it
was
a
noble
act
rare
enough
in
the
five
towns
and
in
other
parts
of
england
but
he
received
no
praise
for
it
he
had
only
done
what
every
man
in
his
position
ought
to
do
if
horace
had
failed
for
ten
times
the
sum
that
his
debts
actually
did
amount
to
and
then
paid
two
shillings
in
the
pound
instead
of
twenty
he
would
have
made
a
stir
in
the
world
and
been
looked
up
to
as
no
ordinary
man
of
business
having
settled
his
affairs
in
this
humdrum
idiotic
manner
horace
took
a
return
to
llandudno
sidney
and
ella
were
staying
at
the
hydro
with
the
strange
welsh
name
and
he
found
sidney
lolling
on
the
sunshiny
beach
in
front
of
the
hydro
discoursing
on
the
banjo
to
himself
when
asked
where
his
wife
was
sidney
replied
that
she
was
lying
down
and
was
obliged
to
rest
as
much
as
possible
horace
ashamed
to
trouble
this
domestic
idyl
related
his
misfortunes
as
airily
as
he
could
and
sidney
said
he
was
awfully
sorry
and
had
no
notion
how
matters
stood
and
could
he
do
anything
for
horace
if
so
horace
might
said
horace
all
right
i
very
fortunately
got
an
excellent
place
as
manager
in
a
big
new
manufactory
in
germany
this
is
how
we
deal
with
german
competition
in
the
five
towns
cried
sidney
said
horace
i
start
the
day
after
tomorrow
said
sidney
any
rate
you
stay
the
night
said
horace
very
kind
i
will
so
they
went
into
the
hydro
together
sidney
caressing
his
wonderful
new
banjo
and
horace
talked
in
low
tones
to
ella
as
she
lay
on
the
sofa
he
convinced
ella
that
his
departure
to
germany
was
the
one
thing
he
had
desired
all
his
life
because
it
was
not
good
that
ella
should
be
startled
shocked
or
grieved
they
dined
well
but
in
the
night
sidney
had
a
recurrence
of
his
old
illness
a
bad
attack
and
horace
sat
up
through
the
dark
hours
fetched
the
doctor
and
bought
things
at
the
chemist
towards
morning
sidney
was
better
and
horace
standing
near
the
bed
gazed
at
his
stepbrother
and
tried
in
his
stupid
way
to
read
the
secrets
beneath
that
curly
hair
but
he
had
no
success
he
caught
himself
calculating
how
much
sidney
had
cost
him
at
periods
of
his
career
when
he
could
ill
spare
money
and
having
caught
himself
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
such
baseness
at
eight
he
ventured
to
knock
at
ella
door
and
explain
to
her
that
sidney
had
not
been
quite
well
she
had
passed
a
peaceful
night
for
he
had
of
course
refrained
from
disturbing
her
he
was
not
quite
sure
whether
sidney
had
meant
him
to
stay
at
the
hydro
as
his
guest
so
he
demanded
a
bill
paid
it
said
and
left
for
he
was
very
exhausted
and
sleepy
happily
the
carriages
on
the
london
are
pretty
comfortable
between
chester
and
crewe
he
had
quite
a
doze
and
dreamed
that
he
had
married
ella
after
all
and
that
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
had
put
the
earthenware
business
on
a
footing
of
magnificent
and
splendid
security
v
a
few
months
later
horace
house
and
garden
at
toft
end
were
put
up
to
auction
by
arrangement
with
his
mortgagee
and
his
and
sidney
was
struck
with
the
idea
of
buying
the
place
the
impression
was
that
it
would
go
cheap
sidney
said
it
would
be
a
pity
to
let
the
abode
pass
out
of
the
family
ella
said
that
the
idea
of
buying
it
was
a
charming
one
because
in
the
garden
it
was
that
she
had
first
met
her
sidney
so
the
place
was
duly
bought
and
sidney
and
ella
went
to
live
there
several
years
elapsed
then
one
day
little
horace
was
informed
that
his
uncle
horace
whom
he
had
never
seen
was
coming
to
the
house
on
a
visit
and
that
he
must
be
a
good
boy
and
polite
to
his
uncle
and
all
the
usual
sort
of
thing
and
in
effect
horace
the
elder
did
arrive
in
the
afternoon
he
found
no
one
to
meet
him
at
the
station
or
at
the
garden
gate
of
the
pleasaunce
that
had
once
been
his
or
even
at
the
front
door
a
pert
told
him
that
her
master
and
mistress
were
upstairs
in
the
nursery
and
that
he
was
requested
to
go
up
and
he
went
up
and
to
be
sure
sidney
met
him
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
banjo
in
hand
cigarette
in
mouth
smiling
easy
and
elegant
as
usual
not
a
trace
of
physical
weakness
in
his
face
or
form
and
horace
was
jocularly
ushered
into
the
nursery
and
introduced
to
his
nephew
ella
had
changed
she
was
no
longer
slim
and
no
longer
gay
and
serious
by
turns
she
narrowly
missed
being
stout
and
she
was
continuously
gay
like
sidney
the
child
was
also
gay
everybody
was
glad
to
see
horace
but
nobody
seemed
deeply
interested
in
horace
affairs
as
a
fact
he
had
done
rather
well
in
germany
and
had
now
come
back
to
england
in
order
to
assume
a
working
partnership
in
a
small
potting
concern
at
hanbridge
he
was
virtually
beginning
life
afresh
but
what
concerned
sidney
and
ella
was
themselves
and
their
offspring
they
talked
incessantly
about
the
infinitesimal
details
of
their
daily
existence
and
the
alterations
which
they
had
made
or
meant
to
make
in
the
house
and
garden
and
occasionally
sidney
thrummed
a
tune
on
the
banjo
to
amuse
the
infant
horace
had
expected
them
to
be
curious
about
germany
and
his
life
in
germany
but
not
a
bit
he
might
have
come
in
from
the
next
street
and
left
them
only
yesterday
for
all
the
curiosity
they
exhibited
we
go
down
to
the
and
have
tea
eh
said
ella
let
go
and
kill
the
fatted
calf
said
sidney
and
strangely
enough
inexplicably
enough
horace
did
feel
like
a
prodigal
sidney
went
off
with
his
precious
banjo
and
ella
picked
up
sundry
belongings
without
which
she
never
travelled
about
the
house
carry
me
unky
the
little
nephew
suggested
with
an
appealing
glance
at
his
new
uncle
said
horace
dashed
if
i
do
baby
bath
i
mrs
blackshaw
had
a
baby
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
baby
interested
the
entire
town
bursley
being
an
ancient
blase
sort
of
borough
of
some
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
babies
in
fact
arrived
in
bursley
at
the
rate
of
more
than
a
thousand
every
year
nevertheless
a
few
weeks
after
the
advent
of
mrs
blackshaw
baby
when
the
medical
officer
of
health
reported
to
the
town
council
that
the
births
for
the
month
amounted
to
and
that
the
of
bursley
compared
favourably
with
the
of
the
sister
towns
hanbridge
knype
longshaw
and
turnhill
when
the
medical
officer
read
these
memorable
words
at
the
monthly
meeting
of
the
council
and
the
staffordshire
signal
reported
them
and
mrs
blackshaw
perused
them
a
blush
of
pride
spread
over
mrs
face
and
she
picked
up
the
baby
left
foot
and
gave
it
a
little
peck
of
a
kiss
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
real
solid
foundation
of
that
formidable
and
magnificent
output
of
babies
was
her
baby
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
she
had
done
something
for
the
town
had
caught
the
public
eye
as
for
the
baby
except
that
it
was
decidedly
superior
to
the
average
infant
in
external
appearance
and
pleasantness
of
disposition
it
was
in
all
essential
characteristics
a
typical
baby
that
is
to
say
it
was
purely
sensuous
and
it
lived
the
life
of
the
senses
it
was
utterly
selfish
it
never
thought
of
anyone
but
itself
it
honestly
imagined
itself
to
be
the
centre
of
the
created
universe
it
was
convinced
that
the
rest
of
the
universe
had
been
brought
into
existence
solely
for
the
convenience
and
pleasure
of
it
the
baby
when
it
wanted
anything
it
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
and
it
was
always
utterly
unscrupulous
in
trying
to
get
what
it
wanted
if
it
could
have
obtained
the
moon
it
would
have
upset
all
the
astronomers
of
europe
and
made
almanack
unsalable
without
a
pang
it
had
no
god
but
its
stomach
it
never
bothered
its
head
about
higher
things
it
was
a
bully
and
a
coward
and
it
treated
women
as
beings
of
a
lower
order
than
men
in
a
word
it
was
that
ideal
creature
sung
of
the
poets
from
which
we
gradually
sink
and
fall
away
as
we
grow
older
at
the
age
of
six
months
it
had
quite
a
lot
of
hair
and
a
charming
rosy
expanse
at
the
back
of
its
neck
caused
through
lying
on
its
back
in
contemplation
of
its
own
importance
it
did
know
the
date
of
the
battle
of
hastings
but
it
knew
with
the
certainty
of
absolute
knowledge
that
it
was
master
of
the
house
and
that
the
activity
of
the
house
revolved
round
it
now
the
baby
loved
its
bath
in
any
case
its
bath
would
have
been
an
affair
of
immense
and
intricate
pomp
but
the
fact
that
it
loved
its
bath
raised
the
interest
and
significance
of
the
bath
to
the
nth
power
the
bath
took
place
at
five
in
the
evening
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
idea
of
the
bath
was
immanent
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
house
when
you
have
an
appointment
with
the
dentist
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
idea
of
the
appointment
is
immanent
in
your
mind
from
the
first
moment
of
your
awakening
conceive
that
an
appointment
with
the
dentist
implies
heavenly
joy
instead
of
infernal
pain
and
you
will
have
a
notion
of
the
daily
state
of
mrs
blackshaw
and
emmie
the
nurse
with
regard
to
the
baby
bath
even
at
ten
in
the
morning
emmie
would
be
keeping
an
eye
on
the
kitchen
fire
lest
the
cook
might
let
it
out
and
shortly
after
noon
mrs
blackshaw
would
be
keeping
an
eye
on
the
thermometer
in
the
bedroom
where
the
bath
occurred
from
four
onwards
the
clocks
in
the
house
were
spied
on
and
overlooked
like
suspected
persons
but
they
were
used
to
that
because
the
baby
had
his
sterilized
milk
every
two
hours
i
have
at
length
allowed
you
to
penetrate
the
secret
of
his
sex
and
so
at
five
precisely
the
august
and
exciting
ceremony
began
in
the
best
bedroom
a
bright
fire
was
burning
the
month
being
december
and
the
electric
lights
were
also
burning
a
large
was
spread
in
a
convenient
place
on
the
floor
and
on
the
towel
were
two
chairs
facing
each
other
and
a
table
on
one
chair
was
the
bath
and
on
the
other
was
mrs
blackshaw
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
on
mrs
blackshaw
was
another
towel
and
on
that
towel
was
roger
the
baby
on
the
table
were
zinc
ointment
vaseline
scentless
eau
de
cologne
castile
soap
and
a
emmie
having
pretty
nearly
filled
the
bath
with
a
combination
of
hot
and
cold
waters
dropped
the
floating
thermometer
into
it
and
then
added
more
waters
until
the
thermometer
indicated
the
precise
temperature
proper
for
a
baby
bath
but
you
are
not
to
imagine
that
mrs
blackshaw
trusted
a
mere
thermometer
no
she
put
her
arm
in
the
water
up
to
the
elbow
she
reckoned
the
sensitive
skin
near
the
elbow
was
worth
forty
thermometers
emmie
was
chiefly
an
audience
mrs
blackshaw
had
engaged
her
as
a
nurse
but
she
could
have
taught
a
to
do
all
that
she
allowed
the
nurse
to
do
during
the
bath
mrs
blackshaw
and
emmie
hated
and
scorned
each
other
despite
their
joy
emmie
was
twice
mrs
blackshaw
age
besides
being
twice
her
weight
and
she
knew
twice
as
much
about
babies
as
mrs
blackshaw
did
however
mrs
blackshaw
had
the
terrific
advantage
of
being
the
mother
of
that
particular
infant
and
she
could
always
end
an
argument
when
she
chose
and
in
her
own
favour
it
was
unjust
and
emmie
felt
it
to
be
unjust
but
this
is
not
a
world
of
justice
roger
though
not
at
all
precocious
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
hostility
between
his
mother
and
his
nurse
and
often
with
his
usual
unscrupulousness
he
used
it
for
his
own
ends
he
was
sitting
upon
his
mother
knees
toying
with
the
edge
of
the
bath
already
tasting
its
delights
in
advance
mrs
blackshaw
undressed
the
upper
half
of
him
and
then
she
laid
him
on
the
flat
of
his
back
and
undressed
the
lower
half
of
him
but
keeping
some
wisp
of
a
garment
round
his
equatorial
regions
and
then
she
washed
his
face
with
a
sponge
and
the
castile
soap
very
gently
but
not
half
gently
enough
for
emmie
nor
half
gently
enough
for
roger
for
roger
looked
upon
this
part
of
the
business
as
insulting
and
superfluous
he
breathed
hard
and
kicked
his
feet
nearly
off
it
dreadful
having
our
face
washed
is
it
said
mrs
blackshaw
with
her
sleeves
up
and
her
hair
by
this
time
down
do
like
it
do
we
yes
yes
emmie
grunted
without
a
sound
and
yet
mrs
blackshaw
heard
her
and
finished
that
face
quickly
and
turned
to
the
hands
every
day
she
said
enough
of
that
colonel
for
after
all
she
had
plenty
of
spirit
little
creases
fat
little
creases
there
he
likes
that
there
feet
feet
feet
and
legs
then
our
back
and
then
whup
we
shall
go
into
the
bath
that
it
kick
kick
your
mother
and
she
turned
him
over
bungler
said
the
eyes
of
the
nurse
she
turn
him
over
neater
than
that
said
the
eyes
of
mrs
blackshaw
would
let
you
bath
him
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
roger
continued
to
breathe
hard
as
if
his
mother
were
a
horse
and
he
were
rubbing
her
down
zoop
whup
cried
his
mother
and
having
deprived
him
of
his
final
rag
she
picked
him
up
and
sat
him
in
the
bath
and
he
was
divinely
happy
and
so
were
the
women
he
appeared
a
gross
little
animal
in
the
bath
all
the
tints
of
his
flesh
shimmering
under
the
electric
light
his
chest
was
superb
but
the
rolled
and
creased
bigness
of
his
inordinate
stomach
was
simply
appalling
not
to
mention
his
great
thighs
and
calves
the
truth
was
he
had
grown
so
that
if
he
had
been
only
a
little
bit
bigger
he
would
have
burst
the
bath
he
resembled
an
old
man
who
had
been
steadily
eating
too
much
for
about
forty
years
his
two
womenfolk
now
candidly
and
openly
worshipped
him
forgetting
sectarian
differences
and
he
splashed
oh
he
splashed
you
see
he
had
learnt
how
to
splash
and
he
had
certainly
got
an
inkling
that
to
splash
was
wicked
and
messy
so
he
splashed
in
his
mother
face
in
emmie
face
in
the
fire
he
pretty
well
splashed
the
fire
out
ten
minutes
before
the
bedroom
had
been
tidy
a
thing
of
beauty
it
was
now
naught
but
a
wild
welter
of
towels
socks
binders
peninsulas
of
clothes
nearly
surrounded
by
water
finally
his
mother
seized
him
again
and
rearing
his
little
legs
up
out
of
the
water
immersed
the
whole
of
his
inflated
torso
beneath
the
surface
she
exclaimed
the
water
run
over
his
mouf
did
it
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
how
clumsy
she
is
commented
the
eyes
of
emmie
i
fink
that
about
long
enough
for
this
kind
of
wevver
said
the
mother
should
think
it
was
there
almost
a
crust
of
ice
on
the
water
now
the
nurse
refrained
from
saying
and
roger
full
of
regrets
was
wrenched
out
of
the
bath
he
had
ceased
breathing
hard
while
in
the
water
but
he
began
again
immediately
he
emerged
do
like
our
face
wiped
do
we
said
his
mother
on
his
behalf
want
to
go
back
into
that
bath
we
like
it
it
more
fun
than
anything
that
happens
all
day
long
eh
that
old
dandruff
coming
up
in
fine
style
it
off
like
anything
and
all
the
while
she
wiped
him
patted
eau
de
cologne
into
him
with
the
flat
of
her
hand
and
rubbed
zinc
ointment
into
him
and
massaged
him
and
powdered
him
and
turned
him
over
and
over
and
over
till
he
was
thoroughly
well
basted
and
cooked
and
he
kept
on
breathing
hard
then
he
sneezed
amid
general
horror
told
you
so
the
nurse
did
say
and
she
rushed
to
the
bed
where
all
the
idol
beautiful
clean
aired
things
were
lying
safe
from
splashings
and
handed
a
flannel
shirt
about
two
inches
in
length
to
mrs
blackshaw
and
mrs
blackshaw
rolled
the
left
sleeve
of
it
into
a
wad
and
stuck
it
over
his
arm
and
his
poor
little
vaccination
marks
were
hidden
from
view
till
next
morning
roger
protested
do
like
clothes
do
we
said
his
mother
want
to
tumble
back
into
our
tub
we
are
much
for
clothes
anyway
a
little
hottentot
are
we
and
she
gradually
covered
him
with
one
garment
or
another
until
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
head
and
his
hands
and
feet
and
she
sat
him
up
on
her
knees
so
as
to
fasten
his
things
behind
and
then
it
might
have
been
observed
that
he
was
no
longer
breathing
hard
but
giving
vent
to
a
sound
between
a
laugh
and
a
cry
while
sucking
his
thumb
and
gazing
round
the
room
our
little
affected
cry
that
we
start
for
our
milk
is
it
his
mother
explained
to
him
and
he
agreed
that
it
was
and
before
emmie
could
fly
across
the
room
for
the
bottle
all
ready
and
waiting
his
mouth
in
the
shape
of
a
perfect
rectangle
had
monopolized
of
his
face
and
he
was
scarlet
and
bellowing
with
impatience
he
took
the
bottle
like
a
tiger
his
prey
and
seized
his
mother
hand
that
held
the
bottle
and
he
furiously
pumped
the
milk
into
that
insatiable
gulf
of
a
stomach
but
he
found
time
to
gaze
about
the
room
too
a
tear
stood
in
each
roving
eye
caused
by
the
effort
of
feeding
that
it
said
his
mother
look
round
and
see
happening
curiosity
well
if
you
will
bob
your
head
i
ca
help
it
course
you
can
the
nurse
did
say
then
he
put
his
finger
into
his
mouth
side
by
side
with
the
bottle
and
gagged
himself
and
choked
and
gave
a
terrible
excuse
the
word
hiccough
after
which
he
seemed
to
lose
interest
in
the
milk
and
the
pumping
operations
slackened
and
then
ceased
whispered
his
mother
seepy
is
the
sandman
throwing
sand
in
your
eyes
old
sandman
at
it
sh
he
had
gone
emmie
took
him
the
women
spoke
in
whispers
and
mrs
blackshaw
after
a
day
spent
in
being
a
mother
reconstituted
herself
a
wife
and
began
to
beautify
herself
for
her
husband
ii
yes
there
was
a
mr
blackshaw
and
with
mr
blackshaw
the
tragedy
of
the
bath
commences
mr
blackshaw
was
a
very
important
young
man
indeed
it
is
within
the
mark
to
say
that
next
to
his
son
he
was
the
most
important
young
man
in
bursley
for
mr
blackshaw
was
the
manager
of
the
newly
opened
municipal
electricity
works
and
the
municipal
electricity
had
created
more
excitement
and
interest
than
anything
since
the
jubilee
when
an
ox
was
roasted
whole
in
the
and
turned
bad
in
the
process
had
bursley
been
a
swiss
village
or
a
french
country
town
or
a
hamlet
in
arizona
it
would
have
had
its
electricity
fifteen
years
ago
but
being
only
a
progressive
english
borough
with
an
annual
value
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
it
struggled
on
with
gas
till
well
into
the
twentieth
century
its
great
neighbour
hanbridge
had
become
acquainted
with
electricity
in
the
nineteenth
century
all
the
principal
streets
and
squares
and
every
decent
shop
that
hanbridge
competition
had
left
standing
and
many
private
houses
now
lighted
themselves
by
electricity
and
the
result
was
splendid
and
glaring
and
coldly
yellow
blackshaw
developed
into
the
hero
of
the
hour
people
looked
at
him
in
the
street
as
though
he
had
been
the
discoverer
and
original
maker
of
electricity
and
if
the
manager
of
the
gasworks
had
not
already
committed
murder
it
was
because
the
manager
of
the
gasworks
had
a
right
sense
of
what
was
due
to
his
position
as
vicar
churchwarden
at
st
peter
church
but
greatness
has
its
penalties
and
the
chief
penalty
of
mr
blackshaw
greatness
was
that
he
could
not
see
roger
have
his
nightly
bath
it
was
impossible
for
mr
blackshaw
to
quit
his
arduous
and
responsible
post
before
seven
in
the
evening
later
on
when
things
were
going
more
smoothly
he
might
be
able
to
get
away
but
then
later
on
his
son
bath
would
not
be
so
amusing
and
agreeable
as
it
then
by
all
reports
was
the
baby
was
of
course
bathed
on
saturday
nights
but
sunday
afternoon
and
evening
mr
blackshaw
was
obliged
to
spend
with
his
invalid
mother
at
longshaw
it
was
on
the
sole
condition
of
his
weekly
presence
thus
in
her
house
that
she
had
consented
not
to
live
with
the
married
pair
and
so
mr
blackshaw
could
not
witness
roger
bath
he
adored
roger
he
understood
roger
he
weighed
nursed
and
fed
roger
he
was
in
all
the
newest
theories
of
infant
rearing
in
short
roger
was
his
passion
and
he
knew
everything
of
roger
except
roger
bath
and
when
his
wife
met
him
at
the
front
door
of
a
night
at
and
launched
instantly
into
a
description
of
the
wonders
delights
and
excitations
of
roger
latest
bath
mr
blackshaw
was
ready
to
tear
his
hair
with
disappointment
and
frustration
suppose
you
could
put
it
off
for
a
couple
of
hours
one
night
may
he
suggested
at
supper
on
the
evening
of
the
particular
bath
described
above
protested
mrs
blackshaw
pained
mr
blackshaw
felt
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
there
was
a
silence
said
mr
blackshaw
at
length
have
just
made
up
my
mind
going
to
see
that
kid
bath
and
what
more
i
going
to
see
it
tomorrow
i
do
care
what
happens
how
shall
you
manage
to
get
away
darling
will
telephone
me
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
you
ready
to
begin
and
i
pretend
it
something
very
urgent
and
scoot
off
that
will
be
lovely
darling
said
mrs
blackshaw
would
like
you
to
see
him
in
the
bath
just
once
he
looks
so
and
so
on
the
next
day
mr
blackshaw
that
fearsome
autocrat
of
the
municipal
electricity
works
was
saying
to
himself
all
day
that
at
five
he
was
going
to
assist
at
the
spectacle
of
his
wonderful
son
bath
the
prospect
inspired
him
so
much
so
that
every
hand
on
the
place
was
doing
its
utmost
in
fear
and
trembling
and
the
whole
affair
was
running
with
the
precision
and
smoothness
of
a
watch
from
four
onwards
mr
blackshaw
in
the
solemn
illuminated
privacy
of
the
managerial
office
safe
behind
glass
partitions
could
no
more
contain
his
excitement
he
hovered
in
front
of
the
telephone
waiting
for
it
to
ring
then
at
a
quarter
to
five
just
when
he
felt
he
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
was
about
to
ring
up
his
wife
instead
of
waiting
for
her
to
ring
him
up
he
saw
a
burly
shadow
behind
the
glass
door
and
gave
a
desolate
sigh
that
shadow
could
only
be
thrown
by
one
person
and
that
person
was
his
worship
the
mayor
of
bursley
his
worship
entered
the
private
office
with
mayoral
assurance
pulling
in
his
wake
a
stout
old
lady
whom
he
introduced
as
his
aunt
from
wolverhampton
and
he
calmly
proposed
that
mr
blackshaw
should
show
the
mayoral
aunt
over
the
new
electricity
works
mr
blackshaw
was
sick
of
showing
people
over
the
works
moreover
he
naturally
despised
the
mayor
all
permanent
officials
of
municipalities
thoroughly
despise
their
mayors
up
their
sleeves
a
mayor
is
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow
whereas
a
permanent
official
is
permanent
a
mayor
knows
nothing
about
anything
except
his
chain
and
the
rules
of
debate
and
he
is
further
a
tedious
and
meddlesome
person
in
the
opinion
of
permanent
officials
so
mr
blackshaw
fury
at
the
inept
appearance
of
the
mayor
and
the
mayoral
aunt
at
this
critical
juncture
may
be
imagined
the
worst
of
it
was
he
did
know
how
to
refuse
the
mayor
then
the
rang
me
said
mr
blackshaw
with
admirably
simulated
politeness
going
to
the
instrument
you
there
who
is
it
me
darling
came
the
thin
voice
of
his
wife
far
away
at
bleakridge
water
just
getting
hot
we
nearly
ready
can
you
come
now
jove
wait
a
moment
exclaimed
mr
blackshaw
and
then
turning
to
his
visitors
you
hear
that
said
the
mayor
those
three
new
dynamos
that
they
got
at
the
hanbridge
electricity
works
have
just
broken
down
i
knew
they
would
i
told
them
they
would
dear
said
the
mayor
of
bursley
secretly
delighted
by
this
disaster
to
a
disdainful
rival
they
have
the
town
in
darkness
what
are
they
going
to
do
want
me
to
go
over
at
once
but
of
course
i
ca
at
least
i
must
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
and
this
lady
over
our
works
first
of
the
kind
mr
blackshaw
said
the
mayor
at
once
go
at
once
if
bursley
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
hanbridge
in
such
a
crisis
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
we
will
come
tomorrow
wo
we
auntie
mr
blackshaw
addressed
the
telephone
mayor
is
here
with
a
lady
and
i
was
just
about
to
show
them
over
the
works
but
his
worship
insists
that
i
come
at
once
the
mayor
put
in
pompously
will
never
cease
came
the
thin
voice
of
mrs
blackshaw
through
the
telephone
very
nice
of
the
old
thing
what
his
lady
friend
like
like
anything
unique
replied
mr
blackshaw
came
the
voice
from
the
thirties
said
mr
blackshaw
coming
and
rang
off
did
know
there
was
any
electric
machinery
as
old
as
that
said
the
mayoral
aunt
just
look
about
us
a
bit
the
mayor
remarked
lose
a
moment
mr
blackshaw
and
mr
blackshaw
hurried
off
wondering
vaguely
how
he
should
explain
the
lie
when
it
was
found
out
but
not
caring
much
after
all
he
could
easily
ascribe
the
episode
to
the
trick
of
some
practical
joker
iii
he
arrived
at
his
commodious
and
electrically
lit
residence
in
the
very
nick
of
time
and
full
to
overflowing
with
innocent
paternal
glee
was
he
not
about
to
see
roger
tub
roger
was
just
ready
to
be
carried
upstairs
as
mr
blackshaw
latchkey
turned
in
the
door
a
sec
cried
mr
blackshaw
to
his
wife
who
had
the
child
in
her
arms
carry
him
up
and
he
threw
away
his
hat
stick
and
overcoat
and
grabbed
ecstatically
at
the
infant
and
he
had
got
perhaps
halfway
up
the
stairs
when
lo
the
electric
light
went
out
every
electric
light
in
the
house
went
out
scott
breathed
mr
blackshaw
aghast
he
pulled
aside
the
blind
of
the
window
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
and
peered
forth
the
street
was
as
black
as
your
hat
or
nearly
so
scott
he
repeated
get
candles
something
had
evidently
gone
wrong
at
the
works
just
his
luck
he
had
quitted
the
works
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
current
had
failed
of
course
the
entire
house
was
instantly
in
an
uproar
turned
upside
down
startled
out
of
its
life
but
a
few
candles
soon
calmed
its
transports
and
at
length
mr
blackshaw
gained
the
bedroom
in
safety
with
the
offspring
of
his
desires
comfortable
in
a
shawl
him
to
me
said
may
shortly
suppose
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
works
at
once
mr
blackshaw
paused
and
then
nerved
himself
but
while
he
was
pausing
may
glancing
at
the
two
feeble
candles
remarked
very
tiresome
i
sure
i
sha
be
able
to
see
properly
almost
shouted
mr
blackshaw
watch
this
kid
have
his
bath
or
i
die
for
it
i
do
care
if
all
the
five
towns
are
in
darkness
i
do
care
if
the
mayor
aunt
has
got
caught
in
a
dynamo
and
is
suffering
horrible
tortures
i
come
to
see
this
bath
business
and
dashed
if
i
do
see
it
do
stand
between
the
bath
and
the
fire
dearest
said
may
coldly
meanwhile
emmie
having
pretty
nearly
filled
the
bath
with
a
combination
of
hot
and
cold
waters
dropped
the
floating
thermometer
into
it
and
then
added
more
waters
until
the
thermometer
indicated
the
precise
temperature
proper
for
a
baby
bath
but
you
are
not
to
imagine
that
mrs
blackshaw
trusted
a
thermometer
she
did
not
however
thrust
her
bared
arm
into
the
water
this
time
no
roger
who
never
cried
before
his
bath
was
crying
was
indubitably
crying
and
he
cried
louder
and
louder
where
he
ca
see
you
dearest
he
is
used
to
you
at
said
mrs
blackshaw
still
coldly
you
my
pet
there
there
mr
blackshaw
effaced
himself
feeling
a
fool
but
roger
continued
to
cry
he
cried
himself
purple
he
cried
till
the
veins
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
his
mouth
was
like
a
map
of
australia
he
cried
himself
into
a
monster
of
ugliness
neither
mother
nor
nurse
could
do
anything
with
him
at
all
think
you
upset
him
dearest
said
mrs
blackshaw
even
more
coldly
you
better
go
protested
the
father
think
you
had
better
go
said
mrs
blackshaw
adding
no
term
of
endearment
and
visibly
controlling
herself
with
difficulty
and
mr
blackshaw
went
he
had
to
go
he
went
out
into
the
unelectric
night
he
headed
for
the
works
not
because
he
cared
twopence
at
that
moment
about
the
accident
at
the
works
whatever
it
was
but
simply
because
the
works
was
the
only
place
to
go
to
and
even
outside
in
the
dark
street
he
could
hear
the
rousing
accents
of
his
progeny
people
were
talking
to
each
other
as
they
groped
about
in
the
road
and
either
making
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
new
electricity
department
or
frankly
cursing
it
with
true
five
towns
directness
of
speech
and
as
mr
blackshaw
went
down
the
hill
into
the
town
his
heart
was
as
black
as
the
street
itself
with
rage
and
disappointment
he
had
made
his
child
cry
someone
stopped
him
mester
blackshaw
said
a
voice
and
under
the
voice
a
hand
struck
a
match
to
light
a
pipe
th
maning
o
this
eclipse
as
treating
us
to
mr
blackshaw
looked
right
through
the
inquirer
a
way
he
had
when
his
brain
was
working
hard
and
he
suddenly
smiled
by
the
light
of
the
match
child
was
crying
because
i
was
there
said
mr
blackshaw
with
solemn
relief
at
all
he
was
crying
because
he
did
understand
the
candles
he
is
used
to
candles
and
they
frightened
him
and
he
began
to
hurry
towards
the
works
at
the
same
instant
the
electric
light
returned
to
bursley
the
current
was
resumed
better
said
mr
blackshaw
sighing
the
silent
brothers
i
john
and
robert
hessian
brothers
bachelors
and
dressed
in
mourning
sat
together
after
supper
in
the
parlour
of
their
house
at
the
bottom
of
oldcastle
street
bursley
maggie
the
servant
was
clearing
the
table
the
cloth
and
the
coffee
said
john
the
elder
liversage
is
coming
in
mr
john
said
maggie
maggie
robert
ordered
laconically
with
a
gesture
towards
the
mantelpiece
behind
him
mr
robert
said
maggie
she
gave
him
a
slate
with
attached
which
hung
on
a
nail
near
the
mantlepiece
robert
took
the
slate
and
wrote
on
it
is
liversage
coming
about
and
he
pushed
the
slate
across
the
table
to
john
whereupon
john
wrote
on
the
slate
know
he
telephoned
me
he
wanted
to
see
us
tonight
and
he
pushed
back
the
slate
to
robert
this
singular
procedure
was
not
in
the
least
attributable
to
deafness
on
the
part
of
the
brothers
they
were
in
the
prime
of
life
aged
and
respectively
and
in
complete
possession
of
all
their
faculties
it
was
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
they
had
quarrelled
and
would
not
speak
to
each
other
the
history
of
their
quarrel
would
be
incredible
were
it
not
full
of
that
ridiculous
pathetic
quality
known
as
human
nature
and
did
not
similar
things
happen
frequently
in
the
manufacturing
midlands
where
the
general
temperament
is
a
fearful
and
strange
compound
of
pride
obstinacy
unconquerableness
romance
and
stupidity
yes
stupidity
no
single
word
had
passed
between
the
brothers
in
that
house
for
ten
years
on
the
morning
after
the
historical
quarrel
robert
had
not
replied
when
john
spoke
to
him
said
john
secret
heart
and
john
secret
heart
ought
to
have
known
better
as
it
was
older
than
its
brother
heart
teach
him
a
lesson
i
wo
speak
until
he
does
and
robert
secret
heart
had
somehow
divined
this
idiotic
resolution
and
had
said
shall
see
maggie
had
been
the
first
to
notice
the
stubborn
silence
then
their
friends
noticed
it
especially
mr
liversage
the
solicitor
their
most
intimate
friend
but
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
anybody
protested
very
strongly
for
john
and
robert
were
not
the
kind
of
men
with
whom
liberties
may
be
taken
and
moreover
bursley
was
slightly
amused
at
the
beginning
it
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
disinterested
spectator
at
a
fight
it
wondered
who
would
win
of
course
it
called
both
the
brothers
fools
yet
in
a
tone
somewhat
sympathetic
because
such
a
thing
as
had
occurred
to
the
hessians
might
well
occur
to
any
man
gifted
with
the
true
bursley
spirit
there
is
this
to
be
said
for
a
bursley
man
having
made
his
bed
he
will
lie
on
it
and
he
will
not
complain
the
hessians
suffered
severely
by
their
dumbness
but
they
suffered
like
stoics
maggie
also
suffered
and
maggie
would
not
stand
it
maggie
it
was
who
had
invented
the
slate
indeed
they
had
heard
some
plain
truths
from
that
stout
bustling
woman
they
had
not
yielded
but
they
had
accepted
the
slate
in
order
to
minimize
the
inconvenience
to
maggie
and
afterwards
they
deigned
to
make
use
of
it
for
their
own
purposes
as
for
friends
friends
accustomed
themselves
to
the
status
quo
there
came
a
time
when
the
spectacle
of
two
men
chattering
to
everybody
else
in
a
company
and
not
saying
a
word
to
each
other
no
longer
appealed
to
bursley
sense
of
humour
the
silent
scenes
at
which
maggie
assisted
every
day
did
not
either
appeal
to
maggie
sense
of
humour
because
she
had
none
so
the
famous
feud
grew
into
a
sort
of
elemental
fact
of
nature
it
was
tolerated
as
the
weather
is
tolerated
the
brothers
acquired
pride
in
it
even
bursley
regarded
it
as
an
interesting
municipal
curiosity
the
sole
imperfection
in
a
lovely
and
otherwise
perfect
quarrel
was
that
john
and
robert
being
both
employed
at
roycroft
majolica
manufactory
the
one
as
works
manager
and
the
other
as
commercial
traveller
were
obliged
to
speak
to
each
other
occasionally
in
the
way
of
business
artistically
this
was
a
pity
though
they
did
speak
very
sternly
and
distantly
the
partial
truce
necessitated
by
roycroft
was
confined
strictly
to
roycroft
and
when
robert
was
not
on
his
journeys
these
two
tall
strong
dark
bearded
men
might
often
be
seen
of
a
night
walking
separately
and
doggedly
down
oldcastle
street
from
the
works
within
five
yards
of
each
other
and
no
one
suggested
the
lunatic
asylum
such
is
the
force
of
pride
of
rank
stupidity
and
of
habit
the
was
scarcely
over
that
evening
when
mr
powell
liversage
appeared
he
was
a
man
with
a
jolly
face
lighter
and
shorter
in
structure
than
the
two
brothers
his
friendship
with
them
dated
from
and
it
had
survived
even
the
entrance
of
liversage
into
a
learned
profession
liversage
who
being
a
bachelor
like
the
hessians
had
many
unoccupied
evenings
came
to
see
the
brothers
regularly
every
saturday
night
and
one
or
other
of
them
dropped
in
upon
him
most
wednesdays
but
this
particular
night
was
a
thursday
do
john
greeted
him
succinctly
between
two
puffs
of
a
pipe
do
replied
liversage
do
pow
robert
greeted
him
in
turn
also
between
two
puffs
of
a
pipe
and
do
little
replied
liversage
a
chair
was
indicated
to
him
and
he
sat
down
and
robert
poured
out
some
coffee
into
a
third
cup
which
maggie
had
brought
john
pushed
away
the
extra
special
of
the
staffordshire
signal
which
he
had
been
reading
up
these
days
john
demanded
said
liversage
and
both
brothers
noticed
that
he
was
rather
ill
at
ease
instead
of
being
humorous
and
lightly
caustic
as
usual
will
turned
up
devil
it
has
john
exclaimed
afternoon
and
then
as
there
was
a
pause
liversage
added
my
sons
the
will
turned
up
where
you
cuckoo
sitting
there
like
that
asked
robert
was
in
that
registered
letter
addressed
to
your
sister
that
the
post
office
people
would
hand
over
until
we
taken
out
letters
of
administration
i
dashed
muttered
john
have
thought
of
that
got
the
will
then
liversage
nodded
the
hessians
had
an
elder
sister
mrs
bott
widow
of
a
colour
merchant
and
mrs
bott
had
died
suddenly
three
months
ago
the
night
after
a
journey
to
manchester
even
at
the
funeral
the
brothers
had
scandalized
the
town
by
not
speaking
to
each
other
mrs
bott
had
wealth
wit
and
wisdom
together
with
certain
peculiarities
of
which
one
was
an
excessive
secrecy
it
was
known
that
she
had
made
a
will
because
she
had
more
than
once
notified
the
fact
in
a
tone
suggestive
of
highly
important
issues
but
the
will
had
refused
to
be
found
so
mr
liversage
had
been
instructed
to
take
out
letters
of
administration
of
the
estate
which
in
the
continued
absence
of
the
will
would
be
divided
equally
between
the
brothers
and
twelve
or
thirteen
thousand
pounds
may
be
compared
to
a
financial
that
cuts
up
very
handsomely
for
two
persons
the
was
about
to
descend
on
its
succulence
when
lo
the
will
came
the
will
to
be
in
the
post
asked
robert
handwriting
on
the
envelope
was
your
sister
said
liversage
the
package
was
posted
in
manchester
very
probably
she
had
taken
the
will
to
manchester
to
show
it
to
a
lawyer
or
something
of
that
sort
and
then
she
was
afraid
of
losing
it
on
the
journey
back
and
so
she
sent
it
to
herself
by
registered
post
but
before
it
arrived
of
course
she
was
dead
was
a
bad
scheme
of
poor
mary
ann
john
commented
was
just
like
her
said
robert
speaking
pointedly
to
liversage
what
an
odd
thing
now
both
these
men
were
no
doubt
excusably
agonized
by
curiosity
to
learn
the
contents
of
the
will
but
would
either
of
them
be
the
first
to
express
that
curiosity
never
in
this
world
not
for
the
fortune
itself
to
do
so
would
scarcely
have
been
bursleyish
it
would
certainly
not
have
been
hessianlike
so
liversage
was
obliged
at
length
to
say
reckon
i
better
read
you
the
will
eh
the
brothers
nodded
you
said
liversage
not
my
will
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
so
kindly
keep
your
hair
on
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
must
have
drawn
it
up
herself
it
not
drawn
properly
at
all
but
witnessed
all
right
and
it
hold
water
just
as
well
as
if
the
blooming
lord
chancellor
had
fixed
it
up
for
her
in
person
he
produced
the
document
and
read
awkwardly
and
this
is
my
will
you
are
both
of
you
extremely
foolish
john
and
robert
and
i
often
told
you
so
nobody
has
ever
understood
and
nobody
ever
will
understand
why
you
quarrelled
like
that
over
annie
emery
you
are
punishing
yourselves
but
you
are
punishing
her
as
well
and
it
is
fair
her
waiting
all
these
years
so
i
give
all
my
estate
no
matter
what
it
is
to
whichever
of
you
marries
annie
and
i
hope
this
will
teach
you
a
lesson
you
need
it
more
than
you
need
my
money
but
you
must
be
married
within
a
year
of
my
death
and
if
the
one
that
marries
cares
to
give
five
thousand
pounds
or
so
to
the
other
of
course
there
nothing
to
prevent
him
this
is
just
a
hint
and
if
you
do
either
of
you
marry
annie
within
a
year
then
i
just
leave
everything
i
have
to
miss
annie
emery
spinster
stationer
and
dealer
duck
bank
bursley
she
deserves
something
for
her
disappointment
and
she
shall
have
it
mr
liversage
solicitor
must
kindly
be
my
executor
and
i
commit
my
soul
to
god
hoping
for
a
blessed
resurrection
january
signed
mary
ann
bott
widow
as
i
told
you
the
witnessing
is
in
order
liversage
finished
it
here
said
john
shortly
and
scanned
the
sheet
of
paper
and
robert
actually
walked
round
the
table
and
looked
over
his
brother
shoulder
ample
proof
that
he
was
terrifically
moved
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
will
like
that
is
good
in
law
exclaimed
john
course
it
good
in
law
liversage
replied
phraseology
is
a
useful
thing
and
it
often
saves
trouble
in
the
end
but
it
indispensable
you
know
was
robert
comment
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
relighted
his
pipe
all
three
men
were
nervous
each
was
afraid
to
speak
afraid
even
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
other
two
an
unmajestic
silence
followed
i
be
off
i
think
liversage
remarked
at
length
with
difficulty
he
rose
say
robert
stopped
him
not
say
anything
about
this
to
miss
to
annie
eh
will
say
nothing
agreed
liversage
infamously
and
unprofessionally
concealing
the
fact
that
he
had
already
said
something
and
he
departed
the
brothers
sat
in
flustered
meditation
over
the
past
and
the
future
ten
years
before
annie
emery
had
been
an
orphan
of
bravely
starting
in
business
for
herself
amid
the
plaudits
of
the
admiring
town
and
john
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
courage
and
her
sense
and
her
feminine
charm
but
alas
as
ovid
points
out
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
woman
to
please
only
one
man
robert
also
had
fallen
in
love
with
annie
each
brother
had
accused
the
other
of
underhand
and
unbrotherly
practices
in
the
pursuit
of
annie
each
was
profoundly
hurt
by
the
accusations
and
each
in
the
immense
fatuity
of
his
pride
had
privately
sworn
to
prove
his
innocence
by
having
nothing
more
to
do
with
annie
such
is
life
such
is
man
such
is
the
terrible
egoism
of
man
and
thus
it
was
that
for
the
sake
of
wounded
pride
john
and
robert
not
only
did
not
speak
to
one
another
for
ten
years
but
they
spoilt
at
least
one
of
their
lives
and
they
behaved
ignobly
to
annie
who
would
certainly
have
married
either
one
or
the
other
of
them
at
two
in
the
morning
john
pulled
a
coin
out
of
his
pocket
and
made
the
gesture
of
tossing
shall
go
first
he
explained
robert
had
a
queer
sensation
in
his
spine
as
his
elder
brother
spoke
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
he
wanted
to
reply
vocally
he
had
a
most
imperious
desire
to
reply
vocally
but
he
could
not
something
stronger
even
than
the
desire
prevented
his
tongue
from
moving
john
tossed
the
coin
it
was
a
sovereign
and
covered
it
with
his
hands
robert
murmured
somewhat
hoarsely
but
it
was
head
then
they
went
to
bed
ii
the
side
door
of
miss
emery
shop
was
in
brick
passage
and
not
in
the
main
street
so
that
a
man
even
a
man
of
commanding
stature
and
formidable
appearance
might
by
insinuating
himself
into
brick
street
off
king
street
and
then
taking
the
passage
from
the
quieter
end
arrive
at
it
without
attracting
too
much
attention
this
course
was
adopted
by
john
hessian
from
the
moment
when
he
quitted
his
own
house
that
friday
evening
in
june
he
had
been
subject
to
the
delusion
that
the
collective
eye
of
bursley
was
upon
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
collective
eye
of
bursley
is
much
too
large
and
important
to
occupy
itself
exclusively
with
a
single
individual
bursley
is
not
a
village
and
let
no
one
think
it
nevertheless
john
was
subject
to
the
delusion
the
shop
was
shut
as
he
knew
it
would
be
but
the
curtained
window
of
the
parlour
between
the
and
the
small
shuttered
of
the
shop
gave
a
strange
suggestion
of
interesting
virgin
spotless
domesticity
within
john
cast
a
fearful
eye
on
the
main
thoroughfare
nobody
seemed
to
be
passing
the
of
the
wesleyan
chapel
on
the
opposite
side
of
trafalgar
road
was
refreshing
the
massive
corinthian
portico
of
that
fane
and
paying
no
regard
whatever
to
the
temple
of
eros
which
miss
emery
shop
had
suddenly
become
so
john
knocked
am
a
fool
his
thought
ran
as
he
knocked
because
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
about
he
had
won
the
toss
and
with
it
the
right
to
approach
annie
emery
before
his
brother
but
what
then
well
he
did
desire
to
marry
her
quite
as
much
for
herself
as
for
his
sister
fortune
but
what
then
how
was
he
going
to
explain
the
tepidity
the
desertion
the
long
sin
against
love
of
ten
years
in
short
how
was
he
going
to
explain
the
inexplicable
he
could
decidedly
do
nothing
that
evening
except
make
a
blundering
ass
of
himself
and
how
soon
would
robert
have
the
right
to
come
along
and
say
his
say
that
point
had
not
been
settled
points
so
extremely
delicate
can
not
be
settled
on
a
slate
and
he
had
not
dared
to
broach
it
viva
voce
to
his
younger
brother
he
had
been
too
afraid
of
a
rebuff
he
then
hoped
that
annie
servant
would
tell
him
that
annie
was
out
annie
however
took
him
at
a
disadvantage
by
opening
the
door
herself
mr
hessian
she
exclaimed
her
face
bursting
into
a
swift
and
welcoming
smile
was
just
passing
the
donkey
in
him
blundered
forth
i
thought
however
in
fifteen
seconds
he
was
on
the
domestic
side
of
the
window
and
seated
in
the
antimacassared
armchair
between
the
and
the
piano
and
annie
had
taken
his
hat
and
told
him
that
her
servant
was
out
for
the
evening
i
disturbing
your
supper
miss
emery
he
said
flurried
though
he
was
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
white
embroidered
cloth
spread
diagonally
on
the
table
and
the
cold
meat
and
the
pastry
and
the
glittering
cutlery
and
crystal
thereon
at
all
she
replied
have
had
supper
yet
i
expect
he
said
not
thinking
will
be
nice
of
you
to
help
me
to
eat
mine
said
she
but
really
but
she
got
plates
and
things
out
of
the
cupboard
below
the
bookcase
and
there
he
was
she
would
take
no
refusal
it
was
wondrous
awfully
glad
i
came
now
his
thought
ran
i
managing
it
rather
well
and
bob
his
sole
discomfort
was
that
he
could
not
invent
a
sufficiently
ingenious
explanation
of
his
call
you
ca
tell
a
woman
you
called
to
make
love
to
her
and
when
your
previous
call
happens
to
have
been
ten
years
ago
some
kind
of
an
explanation
does
seem
to
be
demanded
ultimately
as
annie
was
so
very
pleased
to
see
him
so
friendly
so
feminine
so
equal
to
the
occasion
he
decided
to
let
his
presence
in
her
abode
that
night
stand
as
one
of
those
central
facts
in
existence
that
need
no
explanation
and
they
went
on
talking
and
eating
till
the
dusk
deepened
and
annie
lit
the
gas
and
drew
the
blind
he
watched
her
on
the
sly
as
she
moved
about
the
room
he
decided
that
she
did
not
appear
a
day
older
there
was
the
same
plump
erect
figure
the
same
neatness
the
same
fair
skin
and
fair
hair
the
same
little
nose
the
same
twinkle
in
the
eye
only
perhaps
the
twinkle
in
the
eye
was
a
trifle
less
cruel
than
it
used
to
be
she
was
not
a
day
older
in
this
he
was
of
course
utterly
mistaken
she
was
ten
years
older
she
was
with
ten
years
of
successful
commercial
experience
behind
her
she
would
never
be
again
still
she
was
a
most
desirable
woman
and
a
woman
infinitely
beyond
his
deserts
her
air
of
general
capability
impressed
him
and
with
that
there
was
mingled
a
strange
softness
a
marvellous
hint
of
a
concealed
wish
to
surrender
well
she
made
him
feel
big
and
masculine
in
brief
a
man
he
regretted
the
lost
ten
years
his
present
way
of
life
seemed
intolerable
to
him
the
new
heaven
opened
its
gate
and
gave
glimpses
of
paradise
after
all
he
felt
himself
well
qualified
for
that
paradise
he
felt
that
he
had
all
along
been
a
woman
man
without
knowing
it
jove
his
thought
ran
this
rate
i
might
propose
to
her
in
a
week
or
two
and
again
old
bobbie
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
in
some
miraculous
manner
they
were
more
intimate
than
they
had
ever
been
much
more
intimate
he
revised
his
estimate
of
the
time
that
must
elapse
before
he
might
propose
to
her
in
another
five
minutes
he
was
fighting
hard
against
a
mad
impulse
to
propose
to
her
on
the
spot
and
then
the
fight
was
over
and
he
had
lost
he
proposed
to
her
under
the
shade
of
the
welsbach
light
she
drew
away
as
though
shot
and
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
in
the
silence
which
followed
he
went
back
to
his
original
criticism
of
himself
that
he
was
a
fool
naturally
she
would
request
him
to
leave
she
would
accuse
him
of
effrontery
her
lips
trembled
he
prepared
to
rise
so
sudden
she
said
bliss
glory
celestial
joy
her
words
were
at
least
equivalent
to
an
absolution
of
his
effrontery
she
would
accept
she
would
accept
he
jumped
up
and
approached
her
but
she
jumped
up
too
and
retreated
he
was
not
to
win
his
prize
so
easily
sit
down
she
murmured
must
think
it
over
she
said
apparently
mastering
herself
you
be
at
chapel
next
sunday
morning
he
answered
i
am
there
and
if
i
am
wearing
white
roses
in
my
hat
it
will
mean
she
dropped
her
eyes
he
queried
and
she
nodded
supposing
you
are
there
the
sunday
after
she
said
he
thanked
her
in
his
hessian
style
prefer
that
way
of
telling
you
she
smiled
demurely
will
avoid
the
necessity
for
another
so
much
you
understand
so
quite
so
he
agreed
quite
understand
if
i
do
see
those
roses
he
went
on
shall
take
upon
myself
to
drop
in
for
tea
may
i
she
paused
any
case
you
must
speak
to
me
coming
out
of
chapel
please
as
he
walked
home
down
oldcastle
street
he
said
to
himself
that
the
age
of
miracles
was
not
past
also
that
after
all
he
was
not
so
old
as
the
tale
of
his
years
would
mathematically
indicate
iii
her
absence
from
chapel
on
the
next
sunday
disagreed
with
him
however
robert
was
away
nearly
all
the
week
and
he
had
the
house
to
himself
to
dream
in
it
frequently
happened
to
him
to
pass
by
miss
emery
shop
but
he
caught
no
glimpse
of
her
and
though
he
really
was
in
serious
need
of
and
envelopes
he
dared
not
enter
robert
returned
on
the
friday
on
the
morning
of
the
second
sunday
john
got
up
early
in
order
to
cope
with
a
new
necktie
that
he
had
purchased
in
hanbridge
nevertheless
he
found
robert
afoot
before
him
and
robert
by
some
unlucky
chance
was
wearing
not
merely
a
new
necktie
but
a
new
suit
of
clothes
they
breakfasted
in
their
usual
august
silence
and
john
gathered
from
a
remark
of
robert
to
maggie
when
she
brought
in
the
boots
that
robert
meant
to
go
to
chapel
now
robert
being
a
commercial
traveller
and
therefore
a
bit
of
a
caution
did
not
attend
chapel
with
any
remarkable
assiduity
and
john
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
mind
blamed
him
for
having
been
so
clumsy
as
to
choose
that
particular
morning
for
breaking
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
still
the
presence
of
robert
in
the
pew
could
not
prejudicially
affect
john
and
so
there
was
no
genuine
cause
for
gloominess
after
a
time
it
became
apparent
that
each
was
waiting
for
the
other
to
go
john
began
to
get
annoyed
at
last
he
made
the
plunge
and
went
turning
his
head
halfway
up
oldcastle
street
opposite
the
mansion
which
is
called
peel
he
perceived
robert
fifty
yards
behind
it
was
a
glorious
june
day
he
blushed
as
he
entered
chapel
if
he
was
nervous
it
may
be
accorded
to
him
as
excuse
that
the
happiness
of
his
life
depended
on
what
he
should
see
within
the
next
few
minutes
however
he
felt
pretty
sure
though
it
was
exciting
all
the
same
to
reach
the
hessian
pew
he
was
obliged
to
pass
miss
emery
and
it
was
empty
robert
arrived
the
organist
finished
the
voluntary
the
leading
tenor
of
the
choir
put
up
the
number
of
the
first
hymn
the
minister
ascended
the
staircase
of
the
great
mahogany
pulpit
and
prayed
silently
and
arranged
his
papers
in
the
leaves
of
the
and
glanced
about
to
see
who
was
there
and
who
was
presumably
still
in
bed
and
coughed
and
then
miss
annie
emery
sailed
in
with
that
air
of
false
calm
which
is
worn
by
the
experienced
traveller
who
catches
a
train
by
the
fifth
of
a
second
the
service
commenced
john
looked
she
was
wearing
white
roses
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
that
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
white
roses
in
the
garden
of
her
hat
what
a
thrill
ran
through
john
heart
he
had
won
annie
and
he
had
won
the
fortune
yes
he
would
give
robert
the
odd
five
thousand
pounds
his
state
of
mind
might
even
lead
him
to
make
it
guineas
he
heard
not
a
word
of
the
sermon
and
throughout
the
service
he
rose
up
and
sat
down
several
instants
after
the
rest
of
the
congregation
because
he
was
so
after
service
he
waited
for
everybody
else
to
leave
in
order
not
to
break
his
promise
to
the
divine
annie
so
did
robert
this
rudeness
on
robert
part
somewhat
retarded
the
growth
of
a
young
desire
in
john
heart
to
make
friends
with
poor
bob
then
he
got
up
and
left
and
robert
followed
they
dined
in
silence
john
deciding
that
he
would
begin
his
overtures
of
friendship
after
he
had
seen
annie
and
could
tell
robert
that
he
was
formally
engaged
the
brothers
ate
little
they
both
improved
their
minds
during
their
repast
john
with
the
christian
commonwealth
and
robert
with
the
saturday
cricket
edition
of
the
signal
i
regret
it
then
after
pipes
they
both
went
out
for
a
walk
naturally
not
in
the
same
direction
the
magnificence
of
the
weather
filled
them
both
with
the
joy
of
life
as
for
john
he
went
out
for
a
walk
simply
because
he
could
not
contain
himself
within
the
house
he
could
not
wait
immovable
till
the
hour
at
which
he
meant
to
call
on
annie
for
tea
and
the
betrothal
kiss
therefore
he
ascended
to
hillport
and
wandered
as
far
as
oldcastle
all
in
a
silk
hat
and
a
it
was
precisely
four
as
he
turned
unassumingly
from
brick
street
into
brick
passage
and
so
approached
the
side
door
of
annie
emery
and
his
astonishment
and
anger
were
immense
when
he
saw
robert
likewise
in
silk
hat
and
penetrating
into
brick
passage
from
the
other
end
they
met
and
their
inflamed
spirits
collided
the
meaning
of
this
john
demanded
furious
and
simultaneously
robert
demanded
in
hades
are
you
doing
here
only
sunday
and
the
fine
clothes
and
the
proximity
to
annie
prevented
actual
warfare
calling
on
annie
said
john
am
i
said
robert
you
too
late
said
john
i
too
late
am
i
said
robert
with
a
disdainful
laugh
thanks
tell
you
you
too
late
said
john
may
as
well
know
at
once
that
i
proposed
to
annie
and
she
accepted
me
like
that
i
like
that
said
robert
shout
said
john
not
shouting
said
robert
you
may
as
well
know
that
mistaken
my
boy
it
me
that
proposed
to
annie
and
been
accepted
you
must
be
off
your
chump
did
you
propose
to
her
said
john
friday
if
you
must
know
said
robert
she
accepted
you
at
once
said
john
she
said
that
if
she
was
wearing
white
roses
in
her
hat
this
morning
at
chapel
that
would
mean
she
accepted
said
robert
said
john
suppose
you
admit
she
was
wearing
white
roses
in
her
hat
said
robert
controlling
himself
said
john
and
continued
breathless
was
what
she
said
to
me
she
must
have
told
you
that
white
roses
meant
a
refusal
no
she
did
said
robert
quailing
secretly
but
keeping
up
a
formidable
show
of
courage
an
old
fool
he
added
vindictively
they
were
both
breathing
hard
and
staring
hard
at
each
other
away
said
john
away
we
ca
talk
here
she
may
look
out
of
the
window
so
they
went
away
they
walked
very
quickly
home
and
once
in
the
parlour
they
began
to
have
it
out
and
before
they
had
done
the
reading
of
cricket
news
on
sunday
was
as
nothing
compared
to
the
desecrating
iniquity
which
they
committed
the
scene
was
not
such
as
can
be
decently
recounted
but
about
six
maggie
entered
and
at
considerable
personal
risk
brought
them
back
to
a
sense
of
what
was
due
to
their
name
the
town
and
the
day
she
then
stated
that
she
would
not
remain
in
such
a
house
and
she
departed
iv
whatever
made
you
do
it
dearest
these
words
were
addressed
to
annie
emery
on
the
glorious
summer
evening
which
closed
that
glorious
summer
day
and
they
were
addressed
to
her
by
no
other
person
than
powell
liversage
the
pair
were
in
the
garden
of
the
house
in
trafalgar
road
occupied
by
mr
liversage
and
his
mother
and
they
looked
westwards
over
the
distant
ridge
of
hillport
where
the
moon
was
setting
made
me
do
it
repeated
annie
and
the
twinkle
in
her
eye
had
that
charming
cruelty
which
john
had
missed
they
not
deserve
it
of
course
i
can
talk
to
you
now
with
perfect
freedom
ca
i
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
here
for
ten
years
neither
one
nor
the
other
does
more
than
recognize
me
in
the
street
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
come
down
on
me
like
that
simply
because
there
a
question
of
money
i
could
have
believed
men
could
be
so
stupid
no
i
really
could
they
friends
of
yours
powell
i
know
but
however
that
no
matter
but
it
was
too
ridiculously
easy
to
lead
them
on
they
swallow
any
flattery
i
just
did
it
to
see
what
they
do
and
i
think
i
arranged
it
pretty
well
i
quite
expected
they
would
call
about
the
same
time
and
then
should
i
have
given
them
my
mind
unfortunately
they
met
outside
and
got
very
hot
i
saw
them
from
the
bedroom
window
and
went
away
must
forget
my
dear
girl
said
liversage
it
was
you
they
quarrelled
about
i
do
want
to
defend
for
a
minute
but
it
was
altogether
the
money
that
sent
them
to
you
it
was
more
that
the
money
gave
them
an
excuse
for
coming
was
a
very
bad
excuse
then
said
annie
liversage
murmured
the
moon
was
extremely
lovely
and
romantic
against
the
distant
spire
of
hillport
church
and
its
effect
on
the
couple
was
just
what
might
have
been
anticipated
i
sorry
annie
admitted
at
length
with
a
charming
grimace
i
do
think
there
anything
to
be
sorry
about
said
liversage
of
course
they
think
i
had
a
hand
in
it
you
see
i
never
breathed
a
word
to
them
about
about
my
feelings
towards
you
it
would
have
been
rather
a
delicate
subject
you
see
with
them
and
i
sure
they
be
staggered
when
they
know
that
we
got
engaged
last
night
they
certainly
say
i
er
been
after
you
for
the
no
they
wo
they
decent
chaps
really
very
decent
you
may
be
sure
dear
said
annie
stiffly
rob
them
of
their
vile
money
nothing
would
induce
me
to
touch
it
course
not
dearest
said
liversage
or
rather
the
finer
part
of
him
said
it
the
baser
part
somewhat
regretted
that
vile
twelve
thousand
or
so
i
must
be
truthful
he
took
her
hand
again
at
the
same
moment
old
mrs
liversage
came
hastening
down
the
garden
and
liversage
dropped
the
hand
she
said
john
hessian
and
he
wants
to
see
you
dickens
exclaimed
liversage
glancing
at
annie
must
go
said
annie
shall
go
by
the
fields
good
night
dear
mrs
liversage
ten
seconds
liversage
pleaded
i
be
with
you
and
he
ran
off
john
haggard
and
undone
was
awaiting
him
in
the
said
he
had
a
fearful
row
with
bob
and
i
ca
possibly
sleep
in
our
house
tonight
do
talk
to
me
but
let
me
have
one
of
the
beds
in
your
spare
room
will
you
there
a
good
chap
of
course
johnnie
said
liversage
course
i
go
right
to
bed
now
said
john
an
hour
later
after
powell
liversage
had
seen
his
affianced
to
her
abode
and
returned
home
and
after
his
mother
had
gone
to
bed
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
and
liversage
opened
to
robert
hessian
here
pow
said
robert
whose
condition
was
deplorable

to
sleep
here
tonight

you
mind

a
devil
of
a
shindy
with
jack

maggie

in
the
same
house
with
jack
tonight
what
here
said
robert
ca

just
let
me
have
a
bed
in
your
spare
room
i
sure
you
mother
wo
mind
certainly
said
liversage
he
lit
a
candle
escorted
robert
upstairs
opened
the
door
of
the
spare
room
gave
the
candle
to
robert
pushed
him
in
said
night
and
shut
the
door
what
a
night
the
nineteenth
hat
a
dramatic
moment
was
about
to
arrive
in
the
joint
career
of
stephen
cheswardine
and
vera
his
wife
the
stood
by
the
side
of
the
pavement
of
the
strand
torquay
that
resort
of
southern
wealth
and
fashion
the
chauffeur
felix
had
gone
into
the
automobile
shop
to
procure
petrol
mr
cheswardine
looking
longer
than
ever
in
his
long
coat
was
pacing
the
busy
footpath
mrs
cheswardine
her
beauty
obscured
behind
a
flowing
brown
veil
was
lolling
in
the
tonneau
very
pleased
to
be
in
the
tonneau
very
pleased
to
be
observed
by
all
torquay
in
the
tonneau
very
satisfied
with
her
husband
and
with
the
napier
car
and
especially
with
felix
now
buying
petrol
suddenly
mrs
cheswardine
perceived
that
next
door
but
one
to
the
automobile
shop
was
a
milliner
she
sat
up
and
gazed
according
to
a
card
in
the
window
an
sale
was
in
progress
that
june
day
at
the
milliner
there
were
two
rows
of
hats
in
the
window
each
hat
plainly
ticketed
mrs
cheswardine
descended
from
the
car
crossed
the
pavement
and
gave
to
the
window
the
whole
of
her
attention
she
sniffed
at
most
of
the
hats
but
one
of
them
of
green
straw
with
a
large
curving
green
wing
on
either
side
of
the
crown
and
a
few
odd
bits
of
fluffiness
here
and
there
pleased
her
it
was
parisian
she
had
been
to
paris
once
an
sale
at
a
little
shop
in
torquay
would
not
perhaps
seem
the
most
likely
place
in
the
world
to
obtain
a
chic
hat
it
is
moreover
a
notorious
fact
that
really
chic
hats
can
not
be
got
for
less
than
three
pounds
and
this
hat
was
marked
ten
shillings
nevertheless
hats
are
most
mysterious
things
their
quality
of
being
chic
is
more
often
the
fruit
of
chance
than
of
design
particularly
in
england
you
never
know
when
nor
where
you
may
light
on
a
good
hat
vera
considered
that
she
had
lighted
on
one
probably
duck
feathers
dyed
she
said
to
herself
a
darling
of
a
hat
and
it
will
suit
me
to
a
as
for
the
price
when
once
you
have
taken
the
ticket
off
a
hat
the
secret
of
its
price
is
gone
forever
many
a
hat
less
smart
than
this
hat
has
been
marked
in
bond
street
at
ten
guineas
instead
of
ten
shillings
hats
are
like
they
are
worth
what
people
will
give
for
them
so
vera
approached
her
husband
and
said
with
an
enchanting
innocent
smile
me
will
you
doggie
she
called
him
doggie
in
those
days
because
he
was
a
sort
of
a
sort
of
st
bernard
shaggy
and
big
with
faithful
eyes
and
he
enjoyed
being
called
doggie
but
on
this
occasion
he
was
not
to
be
bewitched
by
the
enchanting
innocence
of
the
smile
nor
by
the
endearing
epithet
he
refused
to
relax
his
features
are
going
to
buy
another
hat
are
you
he
asked
sternly
challengingly
the
smile
disappeared
from
her
face
and
she
pulled
her
slim
young
self
together
she
replied
harshly
the
battle
was
definitely
engaged
you
may
inquire
why
a
man
financially
capable
of
hiring
a
napier
car
with
a
french
chauffeur
named
felix
for
a
week
or
more
should
grudge
his
wife
ten
shillings
for
a
hat
well
you
are
to
comprehend
that
it
was
not
a
question
of
ten
shillings
it
was
a
question
of
principle
vera
already
had
eighteen
hats
and
it
had
been
clearly
understood
between
them
that
no
more
money
should
be
spent
on
attire
for
quite
a
long
time
vera
was
entirely
in
the
wrong
she
knew
it
and
he
knew
it
but
she
wanted
just
that
hat
and
they
were
on
their
honeymoon
you
know
which
enormously
intensified
the
poignancy
of
the
drama
they
had
been
married
only
six
days
in
three
days
more
they
were
to
return
to
the
five
towns
where
stephen
was
solidly
established
as
an
earthenware
manufacturer
you
who
have
been
through
them
are
aware
what
ticklish
things
honeymoons
are
and
how
much
depends
on
the
tactfulness
of
the
more
tactful
of
the
two
parties
stephen
thirteen
years
older
than
vera
was
the
more
tactful
of
the
two
parties
he
had
married
a
beautiful
and
elegant
woman
with
vast
unexploited
capacities
for
love
in
her
heart
but
he
had
married
a
capricious
woman
and
he
knew
it
so
far
he
had
yielded
to
her
caprices
as
well
became
him
but
in
the
depths
of
his
masculine
mind
he
had
his
own
private
notion
as
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
should
ultimately
be
master
in
their
house
and
he
had
decided
only
the
previous
night
that
when
the
next
moment
for
being
firm
arrived
firm
he
would
be
and
now
the
moment
was
upon
him
it
was
their
eyes
that
fought
silently
bitterly
there
is
a
great
deal
of
bitterness
in
true
love
stephen
perceived
the
affair
broadly
in
all
its
aspects
he
was
older
and
much
more
experienced
than
vera
and
therefore
he
was
responsible
for
the
domestic
peace
and
for
her
happiness
and
for
his
own
and
for
appearances
and
for
various
other
things
he
perceived
the
moral
degradation
which
would
be
involved
in
an
open
quarrel
during
the
honeymoon
he
perceived
the
difficulties
of
a
battle
in
the
street
in
such
a
select
and
prim
street
as
the
strand
torquay
where
the
very
backbone
of
england
respectability
goes
shopping
he
perceived
vast
ignorance
of
life
he
perceived
her
charm
and
her
naughtiness
and
all
her
defects
and
he
perceived
further
that
this
being
the
first
conflict
of
their
married
existence
it
was
of
the
highest
importance
that
he
should
emerge
from
it
the
victor
to
allow
vera
to
triumph
would
gravely
menace
their
future
tranquillity
and
multiply
the
difficulties
which
her
adorable
capriciousness
would
surely
cause
he
could
not
afford
to
let
her
win
it
was
his
duty
not
merely
to
himself
but
to
her
to
conquer
but
on
the
other
hand
he
had
never
fully
tested
her
powers
of
sheer
obstinacy
her
willingness
to
sacrifice
everything
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
whim
and
he
feared
these
powers
he
had
a
dim
suspicion
that
vera
was
one
of
that
innumerable
class
of
charming
persons
who
are
perfectly
delicious
and
perfectly
sweet
so
long
as
they
have
precisely
their
own
way
and
no
longer
vera
perceived
only
two
things
she
perceived
the
hat
although
her
back
was
turned
towards
it
and
she
perceived
the
although
it
was
hidden
in
stephen
pocket
my
dear
stephen
protested
know
you
lend
me
vera
repeated
in
a
glacial
tone
the
madness
of
a
desired
hat
had
seized
her
she
was
a
changed
vera
she
was
not
a
loving
woman
not
a
duteous
young
wife
nor
a
reasoning
creature
she
was
an
embodied
instinct
for
hats
was
most
distinctly
agreed
stephen
murmured
restraining
his
anger
just
then
felix
came
out
of
the
shop
followed
by
a
procession
of
three
men
bearing
cans
of
petrol
if
stephen
was
napoleon
and
vera
wellington
felix
was
the
blucher
of
this
deplorable
altercation
impossible
to
have
a
row
yes
a
row
with
your
wife
in
the
presence
of
your
chauffeur
with
his
french
ideas
of
chivalry
you
lend
me
vera
reiterated
in
the
same
glacial
tone
not
caring
twopence
for
the
presence
of
felix
and
stephen
by
means
of
an
interminable
silver
chain
drew
his
from
the
profundity
of
his
it
was
like
drawing
a
bucket
out
of
a
well
and
he
gave
vera
and
that
was
like
knotting
the
rope
for
his
own
execution
and
while
felix
and
his
three
men
poured
gallons
and
gallons
of
petrol
into
a
hole
under
the
cushions
of
the
tonneau
stephen
swallowed
his
wrath
on
the
pavement
and
vera
remained
hidden
in
the
shop
and
the
men
were
paid
and
went
off
and
felix
took
his
seat
ready
to
start
and
then
vera
came
out
of
the
hat
place
and
the
new
green
hat
was
on
her
head
and
the
old
one
in
a
bag
in
her
pretty
hands
do
you
think
of
my
new
hat
felix
she
smiled
to
the
favoured
chauffeur
hope
it
pleases
you
felix
said
that
it
did
in
these
days
chauffeurs
are
a
great
race
and
a
privileged
they
have
usurped
the
position
formerly
held
by
military
officers
women
fawn
on
them
take
fancies
to
them
and
spoil
them
they
can
do
no
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
the
sex
vera
had
taken
a
fancy
to
felix
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
been
in
a
cavalry
regiment
perhaps
it
was
merely
the
curve
of
his
moustache
who
knows
and
felix
treated
her
as
only
a
frenchman
can
treat
a
pretty
woman
with
a
sort
of
daring
humility
with
worship
in
short
with
true
gallic
appreciation
vera
much
enjoyed
gallic
appreciation
it
ravished
her
to
think
that
she
was
the
light
of
poor
felix
existence
an
unattainable
star
for
him
of
course
stephen
did
mind
that
is
to
say
he
did
really
mind
the
car
rushed
off
in
the
direction
of
exeter
homewards
that
day
by
means
of
felix
expert
illegal
driving
they
got
as
far
as
bath
and
there
were
no
breakdowns
the
domestic
atmosphere
in
the
tonneau
was
slightly
disturbed
at
the
beginning
of
the
run
but
it
soon
improved
indeed
after
lunch
stephen
grew
positively
bright
and
gay
at
tea
which
they
took
just
outside
bristol
he
actually
went
so
far
as
to
praise
the
hat
he
said
that
it
was
a
very
becoming
hat
and
also
that
it
was
well
worth
the
money
in
a
word
he
signified
to
vera
that
their
first
battle
had
been
fought
and
that
vera
had
won
and
that
he
meant
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
accept
the
situation
vera
was
naturally
charmed
and
when
she
was
charmed
she
was
charming
she
said
to
herself
that
she
had
always
known
that
she
could
manage
a
man
the
recipe
for
managing
a
man
was
firmness
coupled
with
charm
but
there
must
be
no
half
measures
no
hesitations
she
had
conquered
she
saw
her
future
life
stretching
out
before
her
like
a
beautiful
vista
and
stephen
was
to
be
her
slave
and
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
rein
to
her
caprices
and
charm
stephen
when
he
happened
to
deserve
it
but
the
next
morning
the
hat
had
vanished
out
of
the
bedroom
of
the
exclusive
hotel
at
bath
vera
could
not
believe
that
it
had
vanished
but
it
had
it
was
not
in
the
nor
on
the
couch
nor
under
the
couch
nor
perched
on
a
knob
of
the
bedstead
nor
in
any
of
the
spots
where
it
ought
to
have
been
when
she
realized
that
as
a
fact
it
had
vanished
she
was
cross
and
on
inquiring
from
stephen
what
trick
he
had
played
with
her
hat
she
succeeded
in
conveying
to
stephen
that
she
was
cross
stephen
was
still
in
bed
comatose
the
tone
of
his
reply
startled
her
here
child
he
said
or
rather
snapped
he
had
never
been
snappish
before
you
took
the
confounded
thing
off
last
evening
i
have
seen
it
and
i
have
touched
it
and
i
do
know
where
it
is
you
must
gave
in
to
you
about
the
hat
stephen
continued
to
snap
i
knew
i
was
a
fool
to
do
so
and
i
consider
i
behaved
pretty
pleasantly
over
it
too
but
i
do
want
any
more
scenes
if
you
lost
it
that
not
my
fault
such
speeches
took
vera
very
much
aback
and
she
too
in
her
turn
now
saw
the
dangers
of
a
quarrel
and
in
this
second
altercation
it
was
stephen
who
won
he
said
he
would
not
even
mention
the
disappearance
of
the
hat
to
the
hotel
manager
he
was
sure
it
must
be
in
one
of
trunks
and
in
the
end
vera
performed
that
day
trip
in
another
hat
they
reached
the
five
towns
much
earlier
than
they
had
anticipated
before
lunch
on
the
ninth
day
whereas
the
new
servants
in
their
new
house
at
bursley
were
only
expecting
them
for
dinner
so
stephen
had
the
agreeable
idea
of
stopping
the
car
in
front
of
the
new
hotel
metropole
at
hanbridge
and
lunching
there
precisely
opposite
this
new
and
luxurious
caravanserai
as
they
love
to
call
it
in
the
five
towns
is
the
imposing
garage
and
agency
where
stephen
had
hired
the
napier
car
felix
said
he
would
lunch
hurriedly
in
order
to
transact
certain
business
at
the
garage
before
taking
them
on
to
bursley
after
lunch
however
vera
caught
him
transacting
business
with
a
chambermaid
in
a
corridor
shocking
though
the
revelation
is
it
needs
to
be
said
that
felix
was
kissing
the
chambermaid
the
blow
to
mrs
cheswardine
was
severe
she
had
imagined
that
felix
spent
all
his
time
in
gazing
up
to
her
as
an
unattainable
star
she
spoke
to
stephen
about
it
in
the
accents
of
disillusion
cried
stephen
you
know
they
engaged
to
be
married
her
name
is
mary
callear
she
used
to
be
parlourmaid
at
uncle
john
at
oldcastle
but
hotels
pay
higher
wages
felix
engaged
to
a
parlourmaid
felix
who
had
always
seemed
to
vera
a
gentleman
in
disguise
yes
it
was
indeed
a
blow
but
balm
awaited
vera
at
her
new
home
in
bursley
a
parcel
obviously
containing
a
cardboard
box
had
arrived
for
stephen
he
opened
it
and
the
lost
hat
was
inside
it
stephen
read
a
note
and
explained
that
the
hotel
people
at
bath
had
found
it
and
forwarded
it
he
began
to
praise
the
hat
anew
he
made
vera
put
it
on
instantly
and
seemed
delighted
so
much
so
that
vera
went
out
to
the
porch
to
say
to
felix
in
a
most
forgiving
frame
of
mind
she
forgave
felix
for
being
engaged
to
the
chambermaid
and
there
was
the
chambermaid
walking
up
the
drive
quite
calmly
felix
also
quite
calmly
asked
vera
to
excuse
him
and
told
the
chambermaid
to
get
into
the
car
and
sit
beside
him
he
then
informed
vera
that
he
had
to
go
with
the
car
immediately
to
oldcastle
and
was
taking
miss
callear
with
him
for
the
run
this
being
miss
weekly
afternoon
off
miss
callear
had
come
to
bursley
in
the
electric
tram
vera
shook
with
swift
anger
not
at
felix
information
but
the
patent
fact
that
mary
callear
was
wearing
a
hat
which
was
the
exact
replica
of
the
hat
on
vera
own
head
and
mary
callear
was
seated
like
a
duchess
in
the
car
while
vera
stood
on
the
gravel
and
two
of
vera
new
servants
were
there
to
see
that
vera
was
wearing
a
hat
precisely
equivalent
to
the
hat
of
a
chambermaid
she
went
abruptly
into
the
house
and
sought
for
stephen
as
with
a
sword
but
stephen
was
not
discoverable
she
ran
to
her
elegant
new
bedroom
and
shut
herself
in
she
understood
the
plot
she
had
plenty
of
wit
stephen
had
concerted
it
with
felix
in
spite
of
allegations
of
innocence
the
hat
had
been
sent
somewhere
probably
to
brunt
at
hanbridge
to
be
copied
at
express
speed
and
stephen
had
presented
the
copy
to
felix
in
order
that
felix
might
present
it
to
mary
callear
the
chambermaid
and
the
meeting
in
the
front
garden
had
been
deliberately
arranged
by
that
odious
male
stephen
truly
she
had
not
believed
stephen
capable
of
such
duplicity
and
cruelty
she
removed
the
hat
gazed
at
it
and
then
tore
it
to
pieces
and
scattered
the
pieces
on
the
carpet
an
hour
later
stephen
crept
into
the
bedroom
and
beheld
the
fragments
and
smiled
she
exclaimed
a
horrid
cruel
brute
know
i
am
said
stephen
ought
to
have
found
that
out
long
since
wo
love
you
any
more
it
all
over
she
sobbed
but
he
just
kissed
her
vera
first
christmas
adventure
i
five
days
before
christmas
cheswardine
came
home
to
his
wife
from
a
week
sojourn
in
london
on
business
vera
in
her
quality
of
the
woman
in
bursley
met
him
on
the
doorstep
or
thereabouts
of
their
charming
but
childless
home
attired
in
a
teagown
that
would
have
ravished
a
far
less
impressionable
male
than
her
husband
while
he
in
his
quality
of
a
prosaic
and
flourishing
earthenware
manufacturer
pretended
to
take
the
teagown
as
a
matter
of
course
and
gave
her
the
sober
solid
kiss
of
a
man
who
has
been
married
six
years
and
is
getting
used
to
it
still
the
teagown
had
pleased
him
and
by
certain
secret
symptoms
vera
knew
that
it
had
pleased
him
she
hoped
much
from
that
teagown
she
hoped
that
he
had
come
home
in
a
more
pacific
temper
than
he
had
shown
when
he
left
her
and
that
she
would
carry
her
point
after
all
now
naturally
when
a
husband
in
easy
circumstances
the
possessor
of
a
pretty
and
pampered
wife
spends
a
week
in
london
and
returns
five
days
before
christmas
certain
things
are
rightly
and
properly
to
be
expected
from
him
it
would
need
an
astounding
courage
an
amazing
lack
of
a
sense
of
the
amenity
of
conjugal
existence
in
such
a
husband
to
enable
him
to
disappoint
such
reasonable
expectations
and
cheswardine
though
capable
of
pulling
the
curb
very
tight
on
the
caprices
of
his
wife
was
a
highly
decent
fellow
he
had
no
intention
to
disappoint
he
knew
his
duty
so
that
during
afternoon
tea
with
the
teagown
in
a
cosy
corner
of
the
great
chippendale
he
began
to
unfasten
a
small
wooden
case
which
he
had
brought
into
the
house
in
his
own
hand
opened
it
with
considerable
precaution
making
a
fine
mess
of
on
the
carpet
and
gradually
drew
to
light
a
pair
of
vases
of
venetian
glass
he
put
them
on
the
mantlepiece
he
said
proudly
and
with
a
virtuous
air
they
were
obviously
costly
antique
vases
exquisite
in
form
exquisite
in
the
graduated
tints
of
their
pale
blue
and
rose
century
he
said
very
nice
vera
agreed
with
a
show
of
enthusiasm
are
they
for
christmas
present
cheswardine
explained
and
added
dear
stephen
she
murmured
a
kiss
on
these
occasions
is
only
just
and
cheswardine
had
one
told
me
they
were
quite
unique
he
said
modestly
i
believe
you
might
imagine
that
a
pair
of
venetian
vases
of
the
seventeenth
century
stated
by
duveens
to
be
unique
would
have
satisfied
a
woman
who
had
a
generous
dress
allowance
and
lacked
absolutely
nothing
that
was
essential
but
vera
was
not
satisfied
she
was
on
the
contrary
profoundly
disappointed
for
the
presence
of
those
vases
proved
that
she
had
not
carried
her
point
they
deprived
her
of
hope
the
unpleasantness
before
cheswardine
went
to
london
had
been
more
or
less
a
propos
of
a
christmas
present
vera
had
seen
in
bostock
vast
emporium
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
hanbridge
a
in
the
style
known
as
art
nouveau
which
had
enslaved
her
fancy
she
had
taken
her
husband
to
see
it
and
it
had
not
enslaved
her
husband
fancy
in
the
slightest
degree
it
was
made
in
light
woods
and
the
woods
were
curved
and
twisted
as
though
they
had
recently
spent
seven
years
in
a
purgatory
for
sinful
trees
here
and
there
in
the
design
had
been
set
in
the
wood
the
seat
itself
was
beautifully
soft
what
captured
vera
was
chiefly
the
fact
that
it
did
not
open
at
the
top
as
most
elaborate
do
but
at
either
side
you
pressed
a
button
onyx
and
the
panel
fell
down
displaying
your
music
in
little
compartments
ready
to
hand
and
the
eastern
moiety
of
the
was
for
piano
pieces
and
the
western
moiety
for
songs
in
short
it
was
the
last
word
of
nothing
could
possibly
be
newer
but
cheswardine
did
not
like
it
and
did
not
conceal
his
opinion
he
argued
that
it
would
not
with
the
chippendale
furniture
and
vera
said
that
all
beautiful
things
together
and
cheswardine
admitted
that
they
did
rather
dryly
you
see
they
took
the
matter
seriously
because
the
house
was
their
hobby
they
were
always
changing
its
interior
which
was
more
than
they
could
have
done
for
a
child
even
if
they
had
had
one
and
cheswardine
finer
and
soberer
taste
was
always
fighting
against
vera
predilection
for
the
novel
and
the
bizarre
apart
from
clothes
vera
had
not
much
more
than
the
taste
of
a
mouse
they
did
not
quarrel
in
bostock
indeed
they
did
not
quarrel
anywhere
but
after
vera
had
suggested
that
he
might
at
any
rate
humour
her
by
giving
her
the
for
a
christmas
present
she
seemed
to
think
this
would
somehow
help
it
to
with
the
chippendale
and
cheswardine
had
politely
but
firmly
declined
there
had
been
a
certain
coolness
and
quite
six
tears
vera
had
caused
it
to
be
understood
that
even
if
cheswardine
was
not
interested
in
music
even
if
he
did
hate
music
and
did
call
the
broadwood
ebony
grand
ugly
that
was
no
reason
why
she
should
be
deprived
of
a
pretty
and
original
that
would
keep
her
music
tidy
and
that
would
be
hers
as
for
it
not
going
with
the
chippendale
that
was
simply
an
excuse
etc
hence
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
venetian
vases
of
the
seventeenth
century
left
vera
cold
and
that
the
domestic
prospects
for
christmas
were
a
little
cold
however
vera
with
wifely
and
submissive
tact
made
the
best
of
things
and
that
evening
she
began
to
decorate
the
hall
and
with
holly
and
mistletoe
before
the
pair
retired
to
rest
the
true
christmas
feeling
slightly
tinged
with
a
tender
melancholy
permeated
the
house
and
the
servants
were
growing
excited
in
advance
the
servants
were
going
to
have
a
with
crackers
and
port
and
a
unmatched
in
the
five
towns
the
servants
were
going
to
invite
their
friends
to
an
evening
jollity
the
servants
were
merely
going
to
work
somewhat
harder
and
have
somewhat
less
sleep
but
such
is
the
magical
effect
of
holly
and
mistletoe
twined
round
and
hung
under
chandeliers
that
the
excitement
of
the
servants
was
entirely
pleasurable
and
as
vera
shut
the
bedroom
door
she
said
with
a
delightful
forgiving
smile
saw
a
lovely
at
bostock
yesterday
said
cheswardine
touched
he
had
no
and
he
wanted
one
and
vera
knew
that
he
wanted
one
and
vera
slept
in
the
sweet
consciousness
of
her
thoughtful
wifeliness
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
cheswardine
demanded
pretty
hard
up
are
you
maria
he
called
her
maria
when
he
wished
to
be
arch
well
she
said
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
what
with
the
and
he
gave
her
a
note
it
happened
so
every
year
he
provided
her
with
the
money
to
buy
him
a
christmas
present
but
it
is
i
hope
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
connection
between
her
present
to
him
and
the
money
he
furnished
was
never
crudely
mentioned
she
made
an
opportunity
before
he
left
for
the
works
to
praise
the
venetian
vases
and
she
insisted
that
he
should
wrap
up
well
because
he
was
showing
signs
of
one
of
his
bad
colds
ii
in
the
early
afternoon
she
went
to
bostock
emporium
at
hanbridge
to
buy
the
and
a
few
domestic
trifles
bostock
is
a
good
shop
i
do
not
say
that
it
has
the
classic
and
serene
dignity
of
brunt
over
the
way
where
one
orders
one
suites
and
one
frocks
for
the
january
dances
but
it
is
a
good
shop
and
one
of
the
chief
glories
of
the
paris
of
the
five
towns
it
has
frontages
in
three
streets
and
it
might
be
called
the
shop
of
the
hundred
windows
you
can
buy
pretty
nearly
anything
at
bostock
from
an
art
nouveau
up
to
the
highest
cheese
for
there
is
a
provision
department
you
ca
get
cheese
at
brunt
vera
made
her
uninteresting
purchases
first
in
the
basement
and
then
she
went
to
the
special
christmas
department
which
certainly
was
wonderful
a
blaze
and
splendour
of
electric
light
a
glitter
of
gilded
iridescent
toys
and
a
smiling
excited
pushing
multitude
of
faces
young
and
old
and
the
cashiers
in
their
cages
gathering
in
money
as
fast
as
they
could
lay
their
tired
hands
on
it
a
joyous
brilliant
scene
calculated
to
bring
soft
tears
of
satisfaction
to
the
board
of
directors
that
presided
over
bostock
it
was
a
record
christmas
for
bostock
the
electric
cars
were
thundering
over
the
frozen
streets
of
all
the
five
towns
to
bring
customers
to
bostock
children
dreamt
of
bostock
fathers
went
to
scoff
and
remained
to
pay
brunt
was
not
exactly
alarmed
for
nothing
could
alarm
brunt
but
there
was
just
a
sort
of
suspicion
of
something
in
the
air
at
brunt
that
did
not
make
for
odious
people
seemed
to
become
intoxicated
when
they
went
into
bostock
to
close
their
heads
in
a
frenzy
of
buying
and
there
the
art
nouveau
stood
in
the
corner
where
vera
had
originally
seen
it
she
approached
it
not
thinking
of
the
terrible
danger
the
compartments
for
music
lay
invitingly
open
pounds
nine
and
six
mrs
cheswardine
said
a
who
knew
her
she
stopped
to
finger
it
well
of
course
everybody
is
acquainted
with
that
peculiar
ecstasy
that
undoubtedly
does
overtake
you
in
good
shops
sometimes
especially
at
christmas
i
prefer
to
call
it
ecstasy
rather
than
intoxication
but
i
have
heard
it
called
even
drunkenness
it
is
a
magnificent
and
overwhelming
experience
like
a
good
wine
a
blind
instinct
seizes
your
reason
and
throws
her
out
of
the
window
of
your
soul
and
then
assumes
entire
control
of
the
volitional
machinery
you
listen
to
no
arguments
you
care
for
no
consequences
you
want
a
thing
you
must
have
it
you
do
have
it
vera
was
caught
unawares
by
this
magnificent
and
overwhelming
experience
just
as
she
stooped
to
finger
the
a
fig
for
the
a
fig
for
her
husband
objections
after
all
she
was
a
woman
or
thirty
and
entitled
to
a
certain
freedom
she
was
not
and
would
not
be
a
slave
it
would
look
perfect
in
the
take
it
she
said
mrs
cheswardine
a
unique
thing
quite
unique
penkethman
and
vera
followed
penkethman
to
a
cash
desk
and
received
out
of
a
note
want
it
carefully
packed
said
vera
it
will
be
delivered
in
the
morning
she
was
just
beginning
to
realize
that
she
had
been
under
the
sinister
influence
of
the
ecstasy
and
that
she
had
not
bought
the
and
that
she
had
practically
no
more
money
and
that
stephen
rule
against
credit
was
the
strictest
of
all
his
rules
when
she
caught
sight
of
mr
charles
woodruff
buying
toys
doubtless
for
his
nephews
and
nieces
mr
woodruff
was
the
bachelor
friend
of
the
family
he
had
loved
vera
before
stephen
loved
her
and
he
was
still
attached
to
her
stephen
and
he
were
chums
of
the
most
advanced
kind
why
stephen
and
vera
thought
nothing
of
bickering
in
front
of
mr
woodruff
who
rated
them
both
and
sided
with
neither
said
woodruff
flushing
and
moving
his
long
clumsy
limbs
when
she
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
just
buying
a
few
toys
she
helped
him
to
buy
toys
and
then
he
asked
her
to
go
and
have
tea
with
him
at
the
sub
rosa
tea
rooms
in
machin
street
she
agreed
and
in
passing
the
gave
a
small
parcel
which
she
was
carrying
to
penkethman
and
told
him
he
might
as
well
put
it
in
the
she
was
glad
to
have
tea
with
charlie
woodruff
it
would
distract
her
prevent
her
from
thinking
the
ecstasy
had
almost
died
out
and
she
had
a
violent
desire
not
to
think
iii
a
terrible
blow
fell
upon
her
the
next
morning
stephen
had
one
of
his
bad
colds
one
of
his
worst
the
mere
cold
she
could
have
supported
with
fortitude
but
he
was
forced
to
remain
indoors
and
his
presence
in
the
house
she
could
not
support
with
fortitude
the
would
be
sure
to
arrive
before
lunch
and
he
would
be
there
to
see
it
arrive
the
ecstasy
had
fully
expired
now
and
she
had
more
leisure
to
think
than
she
wanted
she
could
not
imagine
what
mad
instinct
had
compelled
her
to
buy
the
once
out
of
the
shop
these
instincts
always
are
difficult
to
imagine
she
knew
that
stephen
would
be
angry
he
might
perhaps
go
to
the
length
of
returning
the
whence
it
came
for
though
she
was
a
pretty
and
pampered
woman
stephen
had
a
way
in
the
last
resort
of
being
master
of
his
own
house
and
she
could
not
even
placate
him
with
the
gift
of
a
she
could
not
buy
a
with
ten
and
six
she
had
no
other
money
in
the
world
she
never
had
money
yet
money
was
always
running
through
her
fingers
stephen
treated
her
generously
gave
her
an
ample
allowance
but
he
would
under
no
circumstances
permit
credit
nor
would
he
pay
her
allowance
in
advance
she
had
nothing
to
expect
till
the
new
year
she
attended
to
his
cold
and
telephoned
to
the
works
for
a
clerk
to
come
up
and
she
refrained
from
telling
stephen
that
he
must
have
been
very
careless
while
in
london
to
catch
a
cold
like
that
her
in
this
respect
surprised
stephen
but
he
put
it
down
to
the
beneficent
influence
of
christmas
and
the
venetian
vases
bostock
van
arrived
before
the
garden
gate
earlier
than
her
worse
fears
had
anticipated
and
bostock
men
were
evidently
in
a
tremendous
hurry
that
morning
in
quite
an
abnormally
small
number
of
seconds
the
wooden
case
containing
the
fragile
was
lying
in
the
inner
hall
waiting
to
be
unpacked
having
signed
the
vera
stood
staring
at
the
accusatory
package
stephen
was
lounging
over
the
fire
perhaps
dozing
she
would
have
the
thing
swiftly
transported
and
hidden
in
an
attic
for
a
time
but
just
then
stephen
popped
out
of
the
masculine
curiosity
had
been
aroused
by
the
advent
of
bostock
van
he
had
observed
the
incoming
of
the
package
from
the
window
and
he
had
ventured
to
the
hall
to
inspect
it
the
event
had
roused
him
wonderfully
from
the
heavy
torpor
which
a
cold
induces
he
wore
a
the
pockets
of
which
bulged
with
handkerchiefs
ought
to
be
out
here
stephen
said
his
wife
he
said
upon
my
soul
this
steam
heat
is
warmer
than
the
fire
vera
silenced
by
the
voice
of
truth
could
not
reply
stephen
bent
his
great
height
to
inspect
the
package
it
was
an
appetizing
christmas
package
straw
escaped
from
between
its
ribs
and
it
had
an
air
of
being
filled
with
something
at
once
large
and
delicate
observed
stephen
humorously
so
this
is
it
is
it
ah
oh
very
good
and
he
walked
round
it
how
on
earth
had
he
learnt
that
she
had
bought
it
she
had
not
mentioned
the
purchase
to
mr
woodruff
stephen
she
said
timidly
it
and
i
hope
ought
to
hold
a
tidy
few
cigars
that
ought
remarked
stephen
complacently
he
took
it
for
the
she
paused
struck
she
had
to
make
up
her
mind
in
an
instant
yes
she
murmured
thousand
a
thousand
she
said
thought
so
murmured
stephen
must
kiss
you
because
i
got
a
cold
said
he
all
the
same
i
awfully
obliged
vera
suppose
we
have
it
opened
now
eh
then
we
could
decide
where
it
is
to
go
and
i
could
put
my
cigars
in
it
no
she
protested
no
stephen
that
not
fair
it
must
be
opened
before
christmas
morning
i
gave
you
my
vases
yesterday
different
she
said
is
christmas
very
well
he
yielded
all
right
my
dear
then
he
began
to
sniff
a
deuced
odd
smell
from
it
he
said
it
the
wood
she
faltered
hope
it
is
he
said
expect
it
the
straw
a
deuced
odd
smell
we
have
the
thing
put
in
the
side
hall
next
to
the
clock
it
will
be
out
of
the
way
there
and
i
can
come
and
gaze
at
it
when
i
feel
depressed
eh
maria
he
was
undoubtedly
charmed
at
the
prospect
of
owning
so
large
and
precious
a
considering
that
the
parcel
which
she
had
given
to
penkethman
to
put
in
the
comprised
a
of
bostock
very
ripest
gorgonzola
cheese
bought
at
the
cook
special
request
the
smell
which
proceeded
from
the
mysterious
inwards
of
the
did
not
surprise
vera
at
all
but
it
disconcerted
her
none
the
less
and
she
wondered
how
she
could
get
the
cheese
out
for
thirty
hours
the
smell
from
the
unopened
waxed
in
vigour
and
strength
stephen
cold
grew
worse
and
prevented
him
from
appreciating
its
full
beauty
but
he
savoured
enough
of
it
to
induce
him
to
compare
it
facetiously
to
the
effluvium
of
a
dead
rat
and
he
said
several
times
that
bostock
really
ought
to
use
better
straw
he
was
frequently
to
be
seen
in
the
hall
gloating
over
his
once
he
urged
vera
to
have
it
opened
and
so
get
rid
of
the
straw
but
she
refused
and
found
the
nerve
to
tell
him
that
he
was
exaggerating
the
odour
she
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
she
could
not
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
unpack
the
package
and
hide
its
guilty
secret
indeed
to
unpack
the
package
would
bring
about
her
ruin
instantly
for
the
package
unpacked
stephen
would
naturally
expect
to
see
the
and
so
the
hours
crept
on
to
christmas
and
undoing
she
gave
herself
a
headache
it
was
just
thirty
hours
after
the
arrival
of
the
package
when
mr
woodruff
dropped
in
for
tea
stephen
was
asleep
in
the
which
apartment
he
particularly
affected
during
his
colds
woodruff
was
shown
into
the
where
vera
was
having
her
headache
vera
brightened
in
fact
she
suddenly
grew
very
bright
and
she
gave
woodruff
tea
and
took
some
herself
and
woodruff
passed
an
enjoyable
twenty
minutes
the
two
venetian
vases
were
on
the
mantelpiece
vera
rose
into
ecstasies
about
them
and
called
upon
charlie
woodruff
to
rise
too
he
got
up
from
his
chair
to
examine
the
vases
which
vera
had
placed
close
together
side
by
side
at
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
nearest
to
him
vera
and
woodruff
also
stood
close
together
side
by
side
and
just
as
woodruff
was
about
to
handle
the
vases
vera
knocked
his
arm
his
arm
collided
with
one
vase
that
vase
collided
with
the
next
and
both
fell
to
earth
to
the
hard
unfeeling
unyielding
tiles
of
the
hearth
iv
they
were
smashed
to
atoms
vera
screamed
she
screamed
twice
and
ran
out
of
the
room
stephen
she
cried
hysterically
has
broken
my
vases
both
of
them
it
is
too
bad
of
him
he
really
too
clumsy
there
was
a
terrific
pother
stephen
wakened
violently
and
in
a
moment
all
three
were
staring
ineffectually
at
the
thousand
crystal
fragments
on
the
hearth
began
charlie
woodruff
and
that
was
all
he
did
say
he
and
vera
and
stephen
had
been
friends
since
infancy
so
she
had
the
right
not
to
conceal
her
feelings
before
him
stephen
had
the
same
right
they
both
exercised
it
began
charlie
again
never
mind
stephen
stopped
him
curtly
ca
be
helped
shall
get
another
pair
said
woodruff
you
wo
replied
stephen
ca
there
is
another
pair
in
the
world
see
the
two
men
simultaneously
perceived
that
vera
was
weeping
she
was
very
pretty
in
tears
but
that
did
not
prevent
the
masculine
world
from
feeling
awkward
and
charlie
had
notions
about
going
out
and
burying
himself
vera
come
her
husband
enjoined
blowing
his
nose
with
unnecessary
energy
bad
as
his
cold
was
i
liked
those
vases
more
than
anything
you
you
ever
given
me
vera
blubbered
charmingly
patting
her
eyes
stephen
glanced
at
woodruff
as
who
should
say
my
boy
you
uncorked
those
tears
i
leave
you
to
deal
with
you
see
i
an
invalid
in
a
i
leave
you
and
went
charlie
woodruff
expostulated
to
vera
when
he
was
alone
with
her
he
often
started
an
expostulation
with
that
singular
phrase
awfully
sorry
i
do
know
how
it
happened
you
must
let
me
give
you
something
else
vera
shook
her
head
she
said
wanted
stephen
awfully
to
give
me
that
that
i
told
you
about
a
fortnight
ago
but
he
gave
me
the
vases
instead
and
i
liked
them
ever
so
much
better
shall
give
you
the
if
you
wanted
it
a
fortnight
ago
you
want
it
now
it
wo
make
up
for
the
vases
of
course
but
no
said
vera
positively
not
do
not
wish
you
to
give
me
anything
it
would
be
quite
nice
vera
insisted
i
give
you
something
every
christmas
you
asked
vera
innocently
and
you
and
stephen
give
me
something
stephen
does
quite
like
the
that
got
to
do
with
it
you
like
it
i
giving
it
to
you
not
to
him
i
shall
go
over
to
bostock
tomorrow
morning
and
get
it
forbid
you
to
shall
woodruff
departed
within
five
minutes
the
cheswardine
coachman
was
driving
off
in
the
dogcart
to
hanbridge
with
the
in
the
back
of
the
cart
and
a
note
he
brought
back
the
stephen
had
not
stirred
from
the
afraid
to
encounter
a
tearful
wife
presently
his
wife
came
into
the
bearing
the
vast
load
of
the
in
her
delicate
arms
thought
it
might
amuse
you
to
fill
it
with
your
cigars
just
to
pass
the
time
she
said
stephen
thought
was
women
take
the
cake
it
was
a
thought
that
occurs
frequently
to
the
husbands
of
veras
there
was
ripe
gorgonzola
at
dinner
stephen
met
it
as
one
meets
a
person
whom
one
fancies
one
has
met
somewhere
but
can
not
remember
where
the
next
afternoon
the
came
for
the
second
time
into
the
house
charlie
brought
it
in
his
dogcart
it
was
unpacked
ostentatiously
by
the
radiant
vera
what
could
stephen
say
in
depreciation
of
this
gift
from
their
oldest
and
best
friend
as
a
fact
he
could
and
did
say
a
great
deal
but
he
said
it
when
he
happened
to
be
all
alone
in
the
and
had
observed
the
appalling
way
in
which
the
did
not
with
the
chippendale
at
the
d
thing
he
exclaimed
to
himself
at
it
however
the
christmas
was
a
brilliant
success
and
after
it
vera
sat
on
the
art
nouveau
and
twittered
songs
and
what
with
her
being
so
attractive
and
birdlike
and
what
with
the
christmas
feeling
in
the
air
well
stephen
resigned
himself
to
the
the
murder
of
the
mandarin
i
that
you
saying
about
murder
asked
mrs
cheswardine
as
she
came
into
the
large
carrying
the
it
down
here
said
her
husband
referring
to
the
and
pointing
to
a
little
table
which
stood
two
legs
off
and
two
legs
on
the
apron
suits
you
immensely
murmured
woodruff
the
friend
of
the
family
as
he
stretched
his
long
limbs
into
the
fender
towards
the
fire
farther
even
than
the
long
limbs
of
cheswardine
each
man
occupied
an
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
each
was
very
tall
and
each
was
forty
mrs
cheswardine
with
a
whisk
infinitely
graceful
set
the
tray
on
the
table
took
a
seat
behind
it
on
a
chair
that
looked
like
a
toddling
of
the
and
nervously
smoothed
out
the
apron
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
apron
did
suit
her
immensely
it
is
astounding
delicious
adorable
the
effect
of
a
natty
little
domestic
apron
suddenly
put
on
over
an
elaborate
and
costly
frock
especially
when
you
can
hear
the
rustle
of
a
silk
petticoat
beneath
and
more
especially
when
the
apron
is
smoothed
out
by
jewelled
fingers
every
man
knows
this
every
woman
knows
it
mrs
cheswardine
knew
it
in
such
matters
mrs
cheswardine
knew
exactly
what
she
was
about
she
delighted
when
her
husband
brought
woodruff
in
late
of
a
night
as
he
frequently
did
after
a
turn
at
the
club
to
prepare
with
her
own
hands
the
servants
being
in
bed
a
little
snack
of
supper
for
them
tomato
sandwiches
for
instance
miraculously
thin
together
with
champagne
or
bass
the
men
preferred
bass
naturally
but
if
mrs
cheswardine
had
a
fancy
for
a
sip
of
champagne
out
of
her
husband
tumbler
bass
was
not
forthcoming
tonight
it
was
champagne
woodruff
opened
it
as
he
always
did
and
involuntarily
poured
out
a
libation
on
the
hearth
as
he
almost
always
did
ungainly
men
seldom
achieve
the
art
of
opening
champagne
mrs
cheswardine
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
all
nerves
tonight
woodruff
laughed
you
made
me
nervous
and
at
length
he
got
some
of
the
champagne
into
a
tumbler
i
not
mrs
cheswardine
contradicted
him
you
are
vera
woodruff
insisted
calmly
she
smiled
the
use
of
that
elegant
christian
name
with
its
faint
suggestion
of
russian
archduchesses
had
a
strange
effect
on
her
particularly
from
the
lips
of
woodruff
she
was
proud
of
it
and
of
her
surname
too
one
of
the
oldest
surnames
in
the
five
towns
the
syllables
of
invariably
soothed
her
like
a
charm
woodruff
and
cheswardine
also
had
called
her
vera
during
the
whole
of
her
life
and
she
was
thirty
they
had
all
three
lived
in
different
houses
at
the
top
end
of
trafalgar
road
bursley
woodruff
fell
in
love
with
her
first
when
she
was
eighteen
but
with
no
practical
result
he
was
a
man
personable
despite
his
ungainliness
but
he
failed
to
perceive
that
to
worship
from
afar
off
is
not
the
best
way
to
capture
a
young
woman
with
large
eyes
and
an
emotional
disposition
cheswardine
who
had
a
black
beard
simply
came
along
and
married
the
little
thing
she
fluttered
down
on
to
his
shoulders
like
a
pigeon
she
adored
him
feared
him
cooed
to
him
worried
him
and
knew
that
there
were
depths
of
his
mind
which
she
would
never
plumb
woodruff
after
being
best
man
went
on
loving
meekly
and
yet
philosophically
and
found
his
chief
joy
in
just
these
suppers
the
arrangement
suited
vera
and
as
for
the
husband
and
the
hopeless
admirer
they
had
always
been
fast
friends
asked
you
what
you
were
saying
about
murder
said
vera
sharply
it
seems
did
you
woodruff
apologized
was
saying
that
murder
such
an
impossible
thing
as
it
appears
anyone
might
commit
a
murder
you
want
to
defend
harrisford
do
you
hear
what
he
says
stephen
the
notorious
and
terrible
harrisford
murders
were
agitating
the
five
towns
that
november
people
read
talked
and
dreamt
murder
for
several
weeks
they
took
murder
to
all
their
meals
does
want
to
defend
harrisford
at
all
said
cheswardine
with
a
superior
masculine
air
of
course
anyone
might
commit
a
murder
i
might
how
horrid
you
are
might
even
said
woodruff
gazing
at
vera
why
the
blood
alone
is
always
blood
said
the
oracular
husband
here
proceeded
woodruff
who
read
variously
and
enjoyed
philosophical
speculation
that
by
just
taking
thought
by
just
wishing
it
an
englishman
could
kill
a
mandarin
in
china
and
make
himself
rich
for
life
without
anybody
knowing
anything
about
it
how
many
mandarins
do
you
suppose
there
would
be
left
in
china
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
end
of
hours
rather
said
cheswardine
grimly
one
said
woodruff
that
absurd
vera
objected
disturbed
when
these
two
men
began
their
philosophical
discussions
they
always
succeeded
in
disturbing
her
she
hated
to
see
life
in
a
queer
light
she
hated
to
think
is
absurd
woodruff
replied
simply
shows
that
what
prevents
wholesale
murder
is
not
the
wickedness
of
it
but
the
fear
of
being
found
out
and
the
general
mess
and
seeing
the
corpse
and
so
on
vera
shuddered
i
not
sure
woodruff
proceeded
murder
is
so
very
much
more
wicked
than
lots
of
other
things
for
instance
cheswardine
put
in
bigamy
said
woodruff
an
englishman
could
kill
a
mandarin
in
china
by
just
wishing
it
said
vera
looking
up
do
we
know
said
woodruff
in
his
patient
voice
do
we
know
you
remember
what
i
was
telling
you
about
last
week
it
was
in
borderland
vera
felt
as
if
there
was
no
more
solid
ground
to
stand
on
and
it
angered
her
to
be
plunging
about
in
a
bog
think
it
simply
silly
she
remarked
thanks
she
said
thanks
to
her
husband
when
he
tendered
his
glass
he
moved
the
glass
still
closer
to
her
lips
said
no
thanks
she
repeated
dryly
a
mouthful
he
urged
not
thirsty
you
better
go
to
bed
said
he
he
had
a
habit
of
sending
her
to
bed
abruptly
she
did
not
dislike
it
but
she
had
various
ways
of
going
tonight
it
was
the
way
of
an
archduchess
ii
woodruff
in
stating
that
vera
was
all
nerves
that
evening
was
quite
right
she
was
and
neither
her
husband
nor
woodruff
knew
the
reason
the
reason
had
to
do
most
intimately
with
frocks
vera
had
been
married
ten
years
but
no
one
would
have
guessed
it
to
watch
her
girlish
figure
and
her
birdlike
ways
you
see
she
was
the
only
child
in
the
house
she
often
bitterly
regretted
the
absence
of
offspring
to
the
name
and
honour
of
cheswardine
she
envied
other
wives
their
babies
she
doted
on
babies
she
said
continually
that
in
her
deliberate
opinion
the
proper
mission
of
women
was
babies
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
that
regards
a
cathedral
as
a
place
built
especially
to
sit
in
and
dream
soft
domestic
dreams
the
sort
of
woman
that
adores
music
simply
because
it
makes
her
dream
and
vera
brown
studies
which
were
frequent
consisted
chiefly
of
babies
but
as
babies
amused
themselves
by
coming
down
the
chimneys
of
all
the
other
houses
in
bursley
and
avoiding
her
house
she
sought
comfort
in
frocks
she
made
the
best
of
herself
and
it
was
a
good
best
her
figure
was
as
near
perfect
as
a
woman
can
be
and
then
there
were
those
fine
emotional
eyes
and
that
flutteringness
of
the
pigeon
and
an
charm
of
gesture
vera
had
become
the
woman
in
bursley
and
that
is
saying
something
her
husband
was
wealthy
with
an
increasing
income
though
of
course
as
an
earthenware
manufacturer
and
the
son
and
grandson
of
an
earthenware
manufacturer
he
joined
heartily
in
the
general
five
towns
lamentation
that
there
was
no
longer
any
money
to
be
made
out
of
he
liked
to
have
a
woman
about
the
house
and
he
allowed
her
an
incredible
allowance
the
amount
of
which
was
breathed
with
awe
among
vera
friends
a
hundred
a
year
in
fact
he
paid
it
to
her
quarterly
by
cheque
such
was
his
method
now
a
ball
was
to
be
given
by
the
members
of
the
ladies
hockey
club
or
such
of
them
as
had
not
been
maimed
for
life
in
the
pursuit
of
this
noble
pastime
on
the
very
night
after
the
conversation
about
murder
vera
belonged
to
the
hockey
club
in
a
purely
ornamental
sense
and
she
had
procured
a
frock
for
the
ball
which
was
calculated
to
crown
her
reputation
as
a
mirror
of
elegance
the
skirt
had
but
no
see
the
columns
of
the
staffordshire
signal
for
the
november
the
mischief
was
that
the
gown
lacked
for
its
final
perfection
one
particular
thing
and
that
particular
thing
was
separated
from
vera
by
the
glass
front
of
brunt
celebrated
shop
at
hanbridge
vera
could
have
managed
without
it
the
gown
would
still
have
been
brilliant
without
it
but
vera
had
seen
it
and
she
wanted
it
its
cost
was
a
guinea
well
you
will
say
what
is
a
guinea
to
a
dainty
creature
with
a
hundred
a
year
let
her
go
and
buy
the
article
the
point
is
that
she
could
because
she
had
only
six
and
sevenpence
left
in
the
wide
world
and
six
weeks
to
christmas
she
had
squandered
oh
soul
above
money
pounds
and
more
than
pounds
since
the
of
september
well
you
will
say
credit
in
other
words
tick
no
no
no
the
giant
stephen
absolutely
and
utterly
forbade
her
to
procure
anything
whatever
on
credit
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
knew
just
how
far
she
could
go
with
stephen
he
was
great
and
terrible
well
you
will
say
why
could
she
blandish
and
cajole
stephen
for
a
sovereign
or
so
impossible
she
had
a
hundred
a
year
on
the
clear
understanding
that
it
was
never
exceeded
nor
anticipated
well
you
will
discreetly
hint
there
are
certain
devices
known
to
housewives
hush
vera
had
already
employed
them
six
and
sevenpence
was
not
merely
all
that
remained
to
her
of
her
dress
allowance
it
was
all
that
remained
to
her
of
her
household
allowance
till
the
next
monday
hence
her
nerves
there
that
poor
unfortunate
woman
lay
with
her
unconscious
tyrant
of
a
husband
snoring
beside
her
desolately
wakeful
under
the
in
the
large
luxurious
bedroom
three
servants
sleeping
overhead
champagne
in
the
cellar
furs
in
the
wardrobe
valuable
lace
round
her
neck
at
that
very
instant
grand
piano
in
the
horses
in
the
stable
stuffed
bear
in
the
hall
and
her
life
was
made
a
blank
for
want
of
fourteen
and
fivepence
and
she
had
nobody
to
confide
in
how
true
it
is
that
the
human
soul
is
solitary
that
content
is
the
only
true
riches
and
that
to
be
happy
we
must
be
good
it
was
at
that
juncture
of
despair
that
she
thought
of
mandarins
or
rather
i
may
as
well
be
frank
she
had
been
thinking
of
mandarins
all
the
time
since
retiring
to
rest
there
might
be
something
in
mandarin
theory
according
to
charlie
so
many
queer
inexplicable
things
happened
in
the
world
occult
subliminal
astral
thoughtwaves
these
expressions
and
many
more
occurred
to
her
as
she
recollected
charlie
disconcerting
conversations
there
might
one
never
knew
suddenly
she
thought
of
her
husband
pockets
bulging
with
silver
with
gold
and
with
tantalizing
vision
no
she
could
not
steal
besides
he
might
wake
up
and
she
returned
to
mandarins
she
got
herself
into
a
very
morbid
and
state
of
mind
suppose
it
was
a
dodge
that
did
work
of
course
she
was
extremely
superstitious
we
all
are
she
began
to
reflect
seriously
upon
china
she
remembered
having
heard
that
chinese
mandarins
were
very
corrupt
that
they
ground
the
faces
of
the
poor
and
put
innocent
victims
to
the
torture
in
short
that
they
were
sinful
and
horrid
persons
scoundrels
unfit
for
mercy
then
she
pondered
upon
the
remotest
parts
of
china
regions
where
europeans
never
could
penetrate
no
doubt
there
was
some
unimportant
mandarin
somewhere
in
these
regions
to
whose
district
his
death
would
be
a
decided
blessing
to
kill
whom
would
indeed
be
an
act
of
humanity
probably
a
mandarin
without
wife
or
family
a
bachelor
mandarin
whom
no
relative
would
regret
or
in
the
alternative
a
mandarin
with
many
wives
whose
disgusting
polygamy
merited
severe
punishment
an
old
mandarin
already
pretty
nearly
dead
or
in
the
alternative
a
young
one
just
commencing
a
career
of
infamy
awfully
silly
she
whispered
to
herself
still
if
there
should
be
anything
in
it
and
i
must
i
must
i
must
have
that
thing
for
my
dress
she
looked
again
at
the
dim
forms
of
her
husband
clothes
pitched
anyhow
on
an
ottoman
no
she
could
not
stoop
to
theft
so
she
murdered
a
mandarin
lying
in
bed
there
not
any
particular
mandarin
a
vague
mandarin
the
mandarin
most
convenient
and
suitable
under
all
the
circumstances
she
deliberately
wished
him
dead
on
the
of
acquiring
riches
or
more
accurately
because
she
was
short
of
fourteen
and
fivepence
in
order
to
look
perfectly
splendid
at
a
ball
in
the
morning
when
she
woke
up
her
husband
had
already
departed
to
the
works
she
thought
how
foolish
she
had
been
in
the
night
she
did
not
feel
sorry
for
having
desired
the
death
of
a
not
at
all
she
felt
sorry
because
she
was
convinced
in
the
cold
light
of
day
that
the
charm
would
not
work
charlie
notions
were
really
too
ridiculous
too
preposterous
no
she
must
reconcile
herself
to
wearing
a
ball
dress
which
was
less
than
perfection
and
all
for
the
want
of
fourteen
and
fivepence
and
she
had
more
nerves
than
ever
she
had
nerves
to
such
an
extent
that
when
she
went
to
unlock
the
drawer
of
her
own
private
in
which
her
prudent
and
fussy
husband
forced
her
to
lock
up
her
rings
and
brooches
every
night
she
attacked
the
wrong
drawer
an
empty
unfastened
drawer
that
she
never
used
and
lo
the
empty
drawer
was
not
empty
there
was
a
sovereign
lying
in
it
this
gave
her
a
start
connecting
the
discovery
as
naturally
at
the
first
blush
she
did
with
the
mandarin
surely
it
could
be
after
all
then
she
came
to
her
senses
what
absurdity
a
coincidence
of
course
nothing
else
besides
a
mere
sovereign
it
was
enough
charlie
had
said
for
life
the
sovereign
must
have
lain
there
for
months
and
months
forgotten
however
it
was
none
the
less
a
sovereign
she
picked
it
up
thanked
providence
ordered
the
and
drove
straight
to
brunt
the
particular
thing
that
she
acquired
was
an
exceedingly
thin
slim
and
fetching
silver
belt
a
marvel
for
the
money
and
the
ideal
waist
decoration
for
her
wonderful
white
muslin
gown
she
bought
it
and
left
the
shop
and
as
she
came
out
of
the
shop
she
saw
a
street
urchin
holding
out
the
poster
of
the
early
edition
of
the
signal
and
she
read
on
the
poster
in
large
letters
of
li
hung
chang
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
she
nearly
fainted
only
by
the
exercise
of
that
hard
of
which
women
alone
are
capable
did
she
refrain
from
tumbling
against
the
breast
of
adams
the
cheswardine
coachman
she
purchased
the
signal
with
calm
opened
it
and
read
news
pekin
li
hung
chang
the
celebrated
chinese
statesman
died
at
two
this
reuter
iii
vera
reclined
on
the
sofa
that
afternoon
and
the
sofa
was
drawn
round
in
front
of
the
fire
and
she
wore
her
fluffiest
and
languidest
peignoir
and
there
was
a
perfume
of
eau
de
cologne
in
the
apartment
vera
was
having
a
headache
she
was
having
it
in
her
grand
her
official
manner
stephen
had
had
to
lunch
alone
he
had
been
told
that
in
all
probability
his
suffering
wife
would
not
be
well
enough
to
go
to
the
ball
whereupon
he
had
grunted
as
a
fact
vera
headache
was
extremely
real
and
she
was
very
upset
indeed
the
death
of
li
hung
chang
was
heavy
on
her
soul
occultism
was
justified
of
itself
the
affair
lay
beyond
coincidence
she
had
always
known
that
there
was
something
in
occultism
supernaturalism
superstitions
what
not
but
she
had
never
expected
to
prove
the
faith
that
was
in
her
by
such
a
homicidal
act
on
her
own
part
it
was
detestable
of
charlie
to
have
mentioned
the
thing
at
all
he
had
no
right
to
play
with
fire
and
as
for
her
husband
words
could
give
but
the
merest
rough
outline
of
her
resentment
against
stephen
a
pretty
state
of
things
that
a
woman
with
a
position
such
as
she
had
to
keep
up
should
be
reduced
to
six
and
sevenpence
stephen
no
doubt
expected
her
to
visit
the
pawnshop
it
would
serve
him
right
if
she
did
so
and
he
met
her
coming
out
under
the
three
brass
balls
did
she
not
dress
solely
and
wholly
to
please
him
not
in
the
least
to
please
herself
personally
she
had
a
mind
set
on
higher
things
impossible
aspirations
but
he
liked
fine
clothes
and
it
was
her
duty
to
satisfy
him
she
strove
to
satisfy
him
in
all
matters
she
lived
for
him
she
sacrificed
herself
to
him
completely
and
what
did
she
get
in
return
nothing
nothing
nothing
all
men
were
selfish
and
women
were
their
victims
stephen
with
his
silly
bullying
rules
against
credit
and
so
forth
the
worst
of
men
was
that
they
had
no
sense
she
put
a
new
dose
of
eau
de
cologne
on
her
forehead
and
leaned
on
one
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
lay
the
tissue
parcel
containing
the
slim
silver
belt
the
price
of
li
death
she
wanted
to
stick
it
in
the
fire
and
only
the
fact
that
it
would
not
burn
prevented
her
savagely
doing
so
there
was
something
wrong
too
with
the
occultism
to
receive
a
paltry
sovereign
for
murdering
the
greatest
statesman
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
was
simply
grotesque
moreover
she
had
most
distinctly
not
wanted
to
deprive
china
of
a
distinguished
man
she
had
expressly
stipulated
for
an
inferior
and
insignificant
mandarin
one
that
could
be
spared
and
that
was
unknown
to
reuter
she
supposed
she
ought
to
have
looked
up
china
at
the
wedgwood
institution
and
selected
a
definite
mandarin
with
a
definite
place
of
residence
but
could
she
be
expected
to
go
about
a
murder
deliberately
like
that
with
regard
to
the
gross
inadequacy
of
the
fiscal
return
for
her
deed
perhaps
that
was
her
own
fault
she
had
not
wished
for
more
her
brain
had
been
so
occupied
by
the
belt
that
she
had
wished
only
for
the
belt
but
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
vast
wealth
was
to
come
perhaps
something
might
occur
that
very
night
that
would
be
better
yet
would
it
be
better
however
rich
she
might
become
stephen
would
coolly
take
charge
of
her
riches
and
dole
them
out
to
her
and
make
rules
for
her
concerning
them
and
besides
charlie
would
suspect
her
guilt
charlie
understood
her
and
perused
her
thoughts
far
better
than
stephen
did
she
would
never
be
able
to
conceal
the
truth
from
charlie
the
conversation
the
death
of
li
within
two
hours
and
then
a
sudden
fortune
accruing
to
her
charlie
would
inevitably
put
two
and
two
together
and
divine
her
shameful
secret
the
outlook
was
thoroughly
black
anyway
she
then
fell
asleep
when
she
awoke
some
considerable
time
afterwards
stephen
was
calling
to
her
it
was
his
voice
indeed
that
had
aroused
her
the
room
was
dark
say
vera
he
demanded
in
a
low
slightly
inimical
tone
you
taken
a
sovereign
out
of
the
empty
drawer
in
your
she
said
quickly
without
thinking
he
observed
reflectively
knew
i
was
right
he
paused
and
added
coldly
you
are
better
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
then
he
left
her
shutting
the
door
with
a
noise
that
showed
a
certain
lack
of
sympathy
with
her
headache
she
sprang
up
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
thankfulness
that
that
brief
interview
had
occurred
in
darkness
so
stephen
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
sovereign
the
sovereign
was
not
occult
possibly
he
had
put
it
there
and
what
did
he
know
he
was
about
she
lighted
the
gas
and
gazed
at
herself
in
the
glass
realizing
that
she
no
longer
had
a
headache
and
endeavouring
to
arrange
her
ideas
this
said
another
voice
at
the
door
she
glanced
round
hastily
guiltily
it
was
charlie
telephoned
me
you
were
too
ill
to
go
to
the
dance
explained
charlie
i
thought
i
come
and
make
inquiries
i
quite
expected
to
find
you
in
bed
with
a
nurse
and
a
doctor
or
two
at
least
what
is
it
he
smiled
she
replied
a
headache
it
gone
now
she
stood
against
the
mantelpiece
so
that
he
should
not
see
the
white
parcel
good
said
charlie
there
was
a
pause
li
hung
chang
dying
last
night
just
after
we
had
been
talking
about
killing
mandarins
she
said
she
could
not
keep
off
the
subject
it
attracted
her
like
a
snake
and
she
approached
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
fervently
wished
not
to
approach
it
said
charlie
li
was
a
mandarin
you
know
and
he
die
after
we
had
been
talking
about
mandarins
he
died
before
i
thought
it
said
in
the
paper
he
died
at
two
this
morning
in
pekin
charlie
answered
must
remember
that
pekin
time
is
many
hours
earlier
than
our
time
it
lies
so
far
eastward
she
said
again
stephen
hurried
in
with
a
worried
air
it
you
charlie
is
absolutely
dying
i
find
said
charlie
turning
to
vera
are
going
to
the
dance
after
all
are
you
say
vera
stephen
interrupted
you
or
i
must
have
a
scene
with
martha
i
always
suspected
that
confounded
housemaid
so
i
put
a
marked
sovereign
in
a
drawer
this
morning
and
it
was
gone
at
she
better
hook
it
instantly
of
course
i
prosecute
cried
vera
what
on
earth
are
you
thinking
of
i
wish
you
would
leave
the
servants
to
me
if
you
think
you
can
manage
this
house
in
your
spare
time
from
the
works
you
are
welcome
to
try
but
do
blame
me
for
the
consequences
glances
of
triumph
flashed
in
her
eyes
i
tell
you
said
vera
took
the
sovereign
i
saw
it
there
and
i
took
it
and
just
to
punish
you
i
spent
it
it
not
at
all
nice
to
lay
traps
for
servants
like
that
why
did
you
tell
me
just
now
you
had
taken
it
stephen
demanded
crossly
did
feel
well
enough
to
argue
with
you
then
vera
replied
recovered
precious
quick
retorted
stephen
with
grimness
course
if
you
want
to
make
a
scene
before
strangers
vera
whimpered
poor
charlie
a
stranger
go
to
bed
stephen
knew
when
he
was
beaten
she
went
to
the
hockey
dance
though
she
and
stephen
and
charlie
and
his
young
sister
aged
seventeen
all
descended
together
to
the
town
hall
in
a
brougham
the
young
girl
admired
vera
belt
excessively
and
looked
forward
to
the
moment
when
she
too
should
be
a
bewitching
and
captivating
wife
like
vera
in
short
a
woman
of
the
world
worshipped
by
grave
bearded
men
and
both
the
men
were
under
the
spell
of
incurable
charm
capricious
surprising
exasperating
indefinable
indispensable
to
their
lives
superstitions
reflected
vera
of
course
i
never
believed
it
really
and
she
cast
down
her
eyes
to
gloat
over
the
belt
vera
second
christmas
adventure
i
curious
and
strange
things
had
a
way
of
happening
to
vera
perhaps
because
she
was
an
extremely
feminine
woman
but
of
all
the
curious
and
strange
things
that
ever
did
happen
to
vera
this
was
certainly
the
strangest
and
the
most
curious
it
makes
a
somewhat
exasperating
narrative
because
the
affair
ended
or
rather
vera
caused
it
to
end
on
a
note
of
interrogation
the
reader
may
however
draw
consolation
from
the
fact
that
if
he
is
tormented
by
an
unanswerable
query
vera
herself
was
much
more
tormented
by
precisely
the
same
query
two
days
before
christmas
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
just
when
it
was
getting
dusk
and
the
distant
smokepall
of
the
five
towns
was
merging
in
the
general
greyness
of
the
northern
sky
vera
was
sitting
in
the
of
the
of
stephen
house
at
sneyd
sneyd
being
the
fashionable
suburb
of
the
five
towns
graced
by
the
near
presence
of
a
countess
and
as
the
slim
vera
sat
there
moody
for
reasons
which
will
soon
appear
in
her
charming
teagown
her
husband
drove
up
to
the
door
in
the
dogcart
and
he
was
not
alone
he
had
with
him
a
man
of
vigorous
and
dashing
appearance
fair
far
from
ugly
and
with
a
masterful
face
keen
eyes
and
most
magnificent
furs
round
about
him
at
sight
of
the
visitor
vera
heart
did
not
exactly
jump
but
it
nearly
jumped
presently
stephen
brought
his
acquaintance
into
the
my
wife
said
stephen
rubbing
his
hands
vera
this
is
mr
bittenger
of
new
york
he
will
give
us
the
pleasure
of
spending
the
night
here
and
now
vera
little
heart
really
did
jump
she
behaved
with
the
delicious
wayward
grace
which
she
could
always
command
when
she
chose
to
command
it
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
she
had
not
spoken
to
stephen
for
a
week
most
happy
most
happy
said
mr
bittenger
with
a
marked
accent
and
a
fine
complimentary
air
and
obviously
he
was
most
happy
vera
had
impressed
him
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
that
she
was
in
the
fullness
of
her
powers
in
that
direction
it
is
at
this
point
at
the
point
of
the
first
jumping
of
heart
that
the
tale
begins
to
be
uncanny
and
disturbing
thus
runs
the
explanation
during
the
year
stephen
had
gradually
grown
more
and
more
preoccupied
with
the
subject
of
his
own
health
the
earthenware
business
was
very
good
although
of
course
manufacturers
were
complaining
just
as
usual
trade
indeed
flourished
to
such
an
extent
that
stephen
had
pronounced
himself
to
be
suffering
from
nervous
strain
and
overwork
the
symptoms
of
his
malady
were
chiefly
connected
with
the
assimilation
of
food
to
be
brief
it
was
dyspepsia
and
as
stephen
had
previously
been
one
of
those
favoured
people
who
can
eat
anything
at
any
hour
and
arise
in
the
best
of
health
the
next
day
stephen
was
troubled
at
last
about
august
when
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
wine
he
had
suddenly
decided
that
the
grimy
air
of
the
five
towns
was
bad
for
him
and
that
the
household
should
be
removed
to
sneyd
and
removed
to
sneyd
it
accordingly
was
the
new
house
was
larger
and
more
splendid
even
than
the
cheswardine
abode
at
bursley
but
vera
did
not
like
the
change
vera
preferred
the
town
nevertheless
she
could
not
openly
demur
since
stephen
health
was
supposed
to
be
at
stake
during
the
autumn
she
was
tremendously
bored
at
sneyd
she
had
practically
no
audience
for
her
pretty
dresses
and
her
friends
would
not
flock
over
from
bursley
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
home
at
night
then
it
was
that
vera
had
the
beautiful
idea
of
spending
christmas
in
switzerland
someone
had
told
her
about
a
certain
hotel
called
the
bear
where
on
christmas
day
never
less
than
a
hundred
and
wealthy
english
people
sat
down
to
an
orthodox
christmas
dinner
the
notion
enchanted
her
she
decided
definitely
that
she
and
stephen
should
do
their
christmassing
at
the
bear
wherever
the
bear
was
and
as
she
was
fully
aware
of
the
power
of
her
capricious
charm
over
stephen
she
regarded
the
excursion
as
arranged
before
she
had
broached
it
to
him
stephen
refused
he
remarked
bitterly
that
the
very
thought
of
a
made
him
ill
and
that
he
hated
vera
took
her
defeat
badly
she
pouted
she
sulked
she
announced
that
if
she
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
do
her
christmassing
at
the
bear
she
would
not
do
it
anywhere
she
indicated
that
she
meant
to
perish
miserably
of
ennui
in
the
besotted
dullness
of
sneyd
and
that
no
of
any
kind
should
occur
in
her
house
she
ceased
to
show
interest
in
health
she
would
not
speak
in
fact
she
went
too
far
one
day
in
reply
to
her
rude
silence
stephen
said
well
child
if
your
game
i
play
it
with
you
except
when
other
people
are
present
not
a
word
do
i
speak
to
you
until
you
have
first
spoken
to
me
she
knew
he
would
abide
by
that
he
was
a
monster
she
hated
him
she
loathed
him
so
she
said
to
herself
that
night
in
the
agony
of
her
distress
she
had
dreamed
a
dream
she
dreamed
that
a
stranger
came
to
the
house
the
details
were
vague
but
the
stranger
had
travelled
many
miles
over
water
she
could
not
see
him
distinctly
but
she
knew
that
he
was
quite
bald
in
spite
of
his
baldness
he
inspired
her
with
sympathy
he
understood
her
praised
her
costumes
and
treated
a
woman
as
a
woman
ought
to
be
treated
then
somehow
or
other
he
was
making
love
to
her
the
monster
stephen
being
absent
she
was
shocked
by
his
making
love
to
her
and
she
moved
a
little
farther
off
him
on
the
sofa
he
had
sat
down
by
her
on
a
vague
sort
of
sofa
in
a
vague
sort
of
room
but
still
she
was
thrilled
and
she
could
not
feel
as
wicked
as
she
felt
she
ought
to
feel
then
the
dream
became
hazy
it
became
hazy
at
the
interesting
point
of
her
answer
to
the
a
later
stage
was
very
clear
something
was
afoot
between
the
monster
stephen
and
the
stranger
in
the
and
she
was
locked
out
of
the
it
was
christmas
night
she
knocked
frantically
at
the
door
and
at
last
forced
it
open
and
stephen
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
table
had
been
pushed
into
a
corner
killed
him
quite
by
accident
said
the
stranger
affably
and
then
he
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
ruthlessly
dragged
her
away
away
away
and
they
travelled
in
trains
and
ships
and
trains
and
they
came
to
a
very
noisy
clanging
sort
of
city
and
vera
woke
up
it
had
been
a
highly
realistic
dream
and
it
made
a
deep
impression
on
vera
can
one
wonder
that
vera
heart
being
a
superstitious
little
heart
like
all
our
hearts
should
leap
when
the
very
next
day
stephen
turned
up
with
a
completely
unexpected
stranger
from
new
york
of
course
dreams
are
nonsense
of
course
still
she
did
not
know
whether
to
rejoice
or
mourn
over
the
fact
that
mr
bittenger
was
not
bald
he
was
decidedly
unbald
he
had
a
glorious
shock
of
chestnut
hair
that
hair
of
his
naturally
destroyed
any
possible
connection
with
the
dream
none
the
less
the
coincidence
was
bizarre
ii
that
evening
before
dinner
vera
busy
in
her
chamber
beautifying
her
charms
for
the
ravishment
of
men
from
new
york
waited
with
secret
anxiety
for
the
arrival
of
stephen
in
his
and
whereas
she
usually
closed
the
door
between
the
bedroom
and
the
on
this
occasion
she
carefully
left
it
wide
open
stephen
came
at
last
and
she
waited
listening
to
his
movements
in
the
not
a
word
she
made
brusque
movements
in
the
bedroom
to
attract
his
attention
she
even
dropped
a
brush
on
the
floor
not
a
word
after
a
few
moments
she
actually
ventured
into
the
stephen
was
wiping
his
face
and
he
glanced
at
her
momentarily
over
the
towel
which
hid
his
nose
and
mouth
not
a
word
and
how
hard
was
the
monster
glance
she
felt
that
stephen
was
one
of
your
absurd
literal
persons
he
had
said
that
he
would
not
speak
to
her
until
she
had
first
spoken
to
him
that
was
to
say
in
private
public
performances
did
not
count
and
he
would
stick
to
his
text
no
matter
how
deliciously
she
behaved
she
left
the
in
haste
very
well
very
well
if
stephen
wished
for
war
he
should
have
it
her
grievance
against
him
grew
into
something
immense
before
it
had
been
nothing
but
a
kind
of
cottage
she
now
erected
it
into
a
town
hall
with
imposing
portals
and
many
windows
and
rich
statuary
and
suite
after
suite
of
enormous
rooms
and
marble
staircases
and
lifts
that
went
up
and
down
she
wished
she
had
never
married
him
she
wished
that
mr
bittenger
had
been
bald
at
dinner
everything
went
with
admirable
smoothness
mr
bittenger
sat
betwixt
them
and
utmost
politeness
reigned
in
their
quality
of
hosts
they
both
endeavoured
to
keep
mr
bittenger
at
his
ease
despite
their
desolating
quarrel
and
they
entirely
succeeded
as
the
champagne
disappeared
and
it
was
not
stephen
that
drank
it
mr
bittenger
became
more
than
at
his
ease
he
was
buyer
for
an
important
firm
of
earthenware
dealers
in
new
york
vera
had
suspected
as
much
these
hospitalities
to
american
buyers
are
an
essential
part
of
business
in
the
five
towns
and
he
related
very
drolly
the
series
of
chances
or
mischances
that
had
left
him
stranded
in
england
at
that
season
so
unseasonable
for
buying
vera
reflected
upon
the
series
of
chances
or
mischances
and
upon
her
dream
of
the
man
from
over
the
long
miles
of
water
of
course
dreams
are
nonsense
but
still
the
conversation
passed
to
the
topic
of
stephen
health
as
conversations
in
stephen
house
had
a
habit
of
doing
mr
bittenger
listened
with
grave
interest
know
i
know
said
mr
bittenger
used
to
be
exactly
the
same
i
guess
i
understand
how
you
feel
some
do
i
you
are
cured
stephen
demanded
eagerly
as
he
nibbled
at
dry
toast
bet
i
cured
said
mr
bittenger
must
tell
me
about
that
said
stephen
and
added
time
tonight
he
did
not
care
to
discuss
the
bewildering
internal
economy
of
the
human
frame
at
his
there
were
details
and
mr
bittenger
was
in
a
mood
that
it
was
no
exaggeration
to
describe
as
gay
shortly
afterwards
there
arose
a
discussion
as
to
their
respective
ages
they
coquetted
for
a
few
moments
as
men
invariably
will
each
diffident
about
giving
away
the
secret
each
asserting
that
the
other
was
younger
than
himself
said
mr
bittenger
to
vera
at
length
age
should
you
give
me
i
should
give
you
five
years
less
than
stephen
vera
replied
may
i
ask
just
how
old
you
are
mr
bittenger
put
the
question
at
close
range
to
stephen
and
hit
him
full
in
the
face
with
it
forty
said
stephen
am
i
said
mr
bittenger
you
do
look
it
said
stephen
mr
bittenger
admitted
pleased
husband
hair
is
turning
grey
said
vera
yours
grey
exclaimed
mr
bittender
wish
mine
was
i
give
five
thousand
dollars
today
if
mine
was
why
vera
smiled
here
my
dear
lady
said
mr
bittenger
in
a
peculiar
voice
putting
down
his
glass
and
with
a
swift
movement
he
lifted
a
wig
of
glorious
chestnut
hair
from
his
head
just
lifted
it
for
an
instant
and
dropped
it
the
man
was
utterly
and
completely
bald
iii
vera
did
nothing
foolish
she
neither
cried
screamed
turned
deadly
pale
clenched
her
fragile
hands
bit
her
lips
till
the
blood
came
smashed
a
nor
fell
with
a
dull
thud
senseless
to
the
floor
nevertheless
she
was
extremely
perturbed
by
this
astounding
revelation
of
mr
bittenger
of
course
dreams
are
nonsense
but
still
the
truth
is
one
tries
to
believe
that
dreams
are
nonsense
and
up
to
a
certain
point
one
may
succeed
in
believing
but
it
seemed
to
vera
that
circumstances
had
passed
that
point
she
could
not
but
admit
also
that
if
the
dream
went
on
being
fulfilled
within
hours
mr
bittenger
would
have
made
love
to
her
and
would
have
killed
her
husband
she
was
so
incensed
against
stephen
that
she
really
could
not
decide
whether
she
wanted
the
dream
to
be
fulfilled
or
not
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
that
soft
breast
could
conceal
a
homicidal
thought
yet
so
it
was
that
pretty
and
delightful
woman
wandering
about
in
the
edifice
of
her
terrific
grievance
against
stephen
could
not
say
positively
to
herself
that
she
would
not
care
to
have
stephen
killed
as
a
punishment
for
his
sins
after
dinner
she
found
an
excuse
for
retiring
she
must
think
the
puzzle
out
in
solitude
matters
were
really
going
too
far
she
allowed
it
to
be
understood
that
she
was
indisposed
mr
bittenger
was
full
of
sorrow
and
sympathy
but
did
stephen
show
the
slightest
concern
stephen
did
not
she
went
upstairs
and
she
meditated
stretched
on
the
sofa
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
rug
over
her
knees
and
the
fire
glinting
on
her
face
yes
it
was
her
duty
as
a
christian
if
not
as
an
outraged
wife
to
warn
stephen
that
the
shadow
of
death
was
creeping
up
behind
him
he
ought
at
least
to
be
warned
but
how
could
she
warn
him
clearly
she
could
not
warn
him
in
the
presence
of
mr
bittenger
the
prospective
murderer
she
would
therefore
have
to
warn
him
when
they
were
alone
and
that
meant
that
she
would
have
to
give
way
in
the
great
conjugal
sulking
match
no
never
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
give
way
there
she
frowned
desperately
at
the
leaping
flames
and
did
ultimately
decide
that
stephen
death
was
preferable
to
her
defeat
in
that
contest
of
such
is
human
nature
after
all
dreams
were
nonsense
surely
stephen
would
come
upstairs
to
inquire
about
her
health
her
indisposition
but
no
he
came
not
and
as
he
continued
not
to
come
she
went
downstairs
again
and
proclaimed
that
she
was
better
and
then
she
learned
that
she
had
been
worrying
herself
to
no
purpose
whatever
mr
bittenger
was
leaving
on
the
morrow
the
morrow
being
christmas
eve
stephen
would
drive
him
to
bursley
in
the
morning
he
would
go
to
the
five
towns
hotel
to
get
his
baggage
and
catch
the
liverpool
express
at
noon
he
had
booked
a
passage
on
the
saxonia
which
sailed
at
threethirty
thus
he
would
spend
his
christmas
at
sea
and
spending
his
christmas
at
sea
he
could
not
possibly
kill
stephen
in
the
village
of
sneyd
on
christmas
night
relief
and
yet
a
certain
vague
regret
in
the
superstitious
little
heart
the
little
heart
went
to
bed
again
and
stephen
and
the
stranger
stayed
up
talking
very
late
doubtless
about
the
famous
cure
the
the
next
morning
increased
the
vague
regret
mr
bittenger
was
the
possessor
of
an
attractive
individuality
and
vera
pondered
upon
its
attractiveness
far
into
the
afternoon
how
nicely
mr
bittenger
had
thanked
her
for
her
gracious
hospitality
with
what
meaning
he
had
charged
the
expression
of
his
deep
regret
at
leaving
her
after
all
dreams
were
nonsense
she
was
sitting
in
the
of
the
precisely
as
she
had
been
sitting
hours
previously
when
whom
should
she
see
striding
masculinely
along
the
drive
towards
the
house
but
mr
bittenger
this
time
she
was
much
more
perturbed
even
than
she
had
been
by
the
revelation
of
mr
bittenger
baldness
after
all
she
uprose
the
blood
having
rushed
to
her
head
and
retreated
she
knew
not
whither
blindly
without
a
purpose
and
found
herself
in
a
little
which
was
scarcely
ever
used
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
had
not
shut
the
door
and
mr
bittenger
having
been
admitted
by
a
servant
caught
sight
of
her
and
breezily
entered
her
retreat
clad
in
his
magnificent
furs
and
as
he
doffed
the
furs
he
gaily
told
her
what
had
happened
owing
to
difficulties
with
the
cheswardine
mare
on
the
frosty
undulating
road
between
sneyd
and
bursley
and
owing
to
delays
with
his
baggage
at
the
five
towns
hotel
he
had
just
missed
the
liverpool
express
and
therefore
the
steamer
also
he
had
returned
to
stephen
manufactory
stephen
had
insisted
that
he
should
spend
his
christmas
with
them
and
in
brief
there
he
was
he
had
walked
from
bursley
stephen
kept
by
business
was
coming
later
and
so
was
some
of
the
baggage
mr
bittenger
face
radiated
joy
the
loss
of
his
passage
on
the
saxonia
did
not
appear
to
cause
him
the
least
regret
and
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
vera
and
vera
suddenly
noticed
that
they
were
on
a
sofa
the
sofa
of
her
dream
and
she
fancied
she
recognized
the
room
know
my
dear
lady
said
mr
bittenger
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
just
glad
i
missed
my
steamer
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
spend
a
christmas
in
england
and
in
your
delightful
society
your
delightful
society
he
gazed
at
her
without
adding
to
the
sentence
if
this
was
not
on
a
sofa
what
could
be
mr
bittenger
had
certainly
missed
the
liverpool
express
on
purpose
of
that
vera
was
convinced
or
if
he
had
not
missed
it
on
purpose
he
had
missed
it
under
the
dictates
of
the
mysterious
power
of
the
dream
those
people
who
chose
to
believe
that
dreams
are
nonsense
were
at
liberty
to
do
so
iv
so
that
in
spite
of
vera
definite
proclamation
that
there
should
be
no
christmassing
in
her
house
that
year
christmassing
there
emphatically
was
impossible
to
deny
anything
to
mr
bittenger
mr
bittenger
wanted
holly
the
gardener
supplied
it
mr
bittenger
wanted
mistletoe
a
bunch
of
it
was
brought
home
by
stephen
in
the
dogcart
mr
bittenger
could
not
conceive
an
english
christmas
without
turkey
and
all
the
usual
indigestiveness
vera
speaking
in
a
voice
which
seemed
somehow
not
to
be
hers
stated
that
these
necessaries
of
christmas
life
would
be
produced
and
stephen
did
not
say
that
the
very
thought
of
a
made
him
ill
even
the
english
weather
which
it
is
notorious
has
of
late
shown
a
sad
disposition
to
imitate
and
even
to
surpass
in
mildness
the
weather
of
the
riviera
at
christmas
decided
to
oblige
mr
bittenger
at
nightfall
on
christmas
eve
it
began
to
snow
gently
but
steadily
fine
frozen
snow
and
the
waits
consisting
of
boys
and
girls
from
the
countess
of
chell
celebrated
institute
close
by
came
and
sang
in
the
garden
in
the
falling
snow
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
and
mr
bittenger
heart
was
as
full
as
it
could
hold
of
english
christmas
as
for
vera
heart
it
was
full
of
she
knew
not
what
mr
attitude
towards
her
grew
more
and
more
chivalrous
he
contrived
to
indicate
that
he
regarded
all
the
years
he
had
spent
before
making
the
acquaintance
of
vera
as
so
many
years
absolutely
wasted
and
stephen
did
not
seem
to
care
they
retired
to
rest
that
evening
up
a
staircase
whose
banisters
the
industrious
hands
of
mr
bittenger
had
entwined
with
holly
and
paper
festoons
and
bade
each
other
a
merry
christmas
with
immense
fervour
but
in
the
conjugal
chamber
stephen
maintained
his
policy
of
implacable
silence
and
naturally
vera
maintained
hers
could
it
be
expected
of
her
that
she
should
yield
the
fault
was
all
stephen
he
ought
to
have
taken
her
to
the
bear
switzerland
then
there
would
have
been
no
dream
no
mr
bittenger
and
no
danger
but
as
things
were
within
hours
he
would
be
a
dead
man
and
throughout
christmas
day
vera
beneath
the
gaiety
with
which
she
met
the
vivacious
sallies
of
mr
bittenger
waited
in
horrible
suspense
for
the
dream
to
fulfil
itself
stephen
alone
observed
her
agitated
condition
stephen
said
to
himself
quarrel
is
getting
on
her
nerves
she
yield
before
she
a
day
older
it
will
do
her
good
then
i
make
it
up
to
her
handsomely
but
she
must
yield
first
he
little
knew
he
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
of
death
the
christmas
dinner
succeeded
admirably
and
stephen
in
whom
courage
was
seldom
lacking
ate
half
a
the
day
was
almost
over
no
premature
decease
had
so
far
occurred
and
when
both
the
men
said
that
if
vera
permitted
they
would
come
with
her
at
once
to
the
and
smoke
there
vera
decided
that
after
all
dreams
were
nonsense
she
entered
the
first
and
mr
bittenger
followed
her
with
stephen
behind
but
just
as
stephen
was
crossing
the
mat
the
gardener
holding
a
parcel
in
his
hands
and
looking
rather
strange
there
in
the
hall
spoke
to
him
and
stephen
stopped
and
called
to
mr
bittenger
and
the
door
was
closed
upon
vera
she
waited
solitary
for
an
incredible
space
of
time
and
then
having
heard
unaccustomed
and
violent
sounds
in
the
distance
she
could
contain
herself
no
longer
and
she
rang
the
bell
she
demanded
of
the
parlourmaid
is
your
master
replied
louisa
giggling
a
little
licence
was
surely
permissible
to
the
girl
on
christmas
night
there
such
a
tinsley
has
just
brought
some
and
master
and
mr
bittenger
have
got
their
coats
off
in
the
and
they
had
the
table
pushed
up
by
the
door
and
you
never
saw
such
a
in
all
your
life
vera
dismissed
louisa
there
it
was
the
dream
they
were
going
to
box
mr
bittenger
was
doubtless
an
expert
and
she
knew
that
stephen
was
not
a
chance
blow
by
mr
bittenger
in
some
vital
part
and
stephen
would
be
lying
stretched
in
eternal
stillness
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
the
table
ought
to
be
the
life
of
the
monster
was
at
stake
the
life
of
the
brute
was
in
her
hands
the
dream
was
fulfilling
itself
to
the
point
of
tragedy
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
the
door
it
would
not
open
again
the
dream
ca
come
in
cried
stephen
laughing
a
bit
she
pushed
against
the
door
working
the
handle
she
was
about
to
insist
upon
the
door
being
opened
when
the
idea
of
the
danger
of
such
a
proceeding
occurred
to
her
in
the
dream
when
she
got
the
door
opened
her
husband
death
had
already
happened
frantically
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
she
ordered
into
the
garden
and
tap
at
the
window
and
tell
your
master
that
i
must
speak
to
him
at
once
in
the
and
in
a
pitiable
state
of
excitation
she
returned
to
the
after
another
interminable
period
of
suspense
her
ear
caught
the
sound
of
the
opening
of
doors
and
then
stephen
came
into
the
a
singular
apparition
he
was
coatless
as
louisa
had
said
and
the
extremities
of
his
long
arms
were
bulged
out
with
she
sprang
at
him
and
kissed
him
she
said
we
friends
should
think
we
were
he
replied
returning
her
kiss
heartily
he
had
won
are
you
doing
she
asked
him
and
i
are
just
going
to
have
a
real
round
with
the
gloves
it
part
of
his
cure
for
my
indigestion
you
know
he
says
nothing
like
it
i
only
just
been
able
to
get
gloves
tinsley
brought
them
up
just
now
and
so
we
sort
of
thought
we
like
to
have
a
go
at
once
would
you
let
me
into
the
child
the
table
was
up
against
the
door
and
i
fancied
perhaps
you
would
be
exactly
charmed
so
i
she
said
in
her
most
persuasive
voice
you
do
something
to
please
me
is
it
you
a
pause
certainly
box
tonight
well
what
will
bittenger
think
another
pause
mind
you
do
want
me
to
box
really
do
want
you
to
box
not
tonight
my
chuck
and
he
kissed
her
again
he
could
well
afford
to
be
magnanimous
mr
bittenger
ploughed
the
seas
alone
to
new
york
but
supposing
that
vera
had
not
interfered
what
would
have
happened
that
is
the
unanswerable
query
which
torments
the
superstitious
little
brain
of
vera
the
burglary
i
lady
dain
said
if
that
portrait
stays
there
much
longer
just
have
to
take
me
off
to
pirehill
one
of
these
fine
mornings
pirehill
is
the
seat
of
the
great
local
hospital
but
it
is
also
the
seat
of
the
great
local
lunatic
asylum
and
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
say
merely
they
mean
the
asylum
do
declare
i
ca
fancy
my
food
said
lady
dain
it
all
that
portrait
she
stared
plaintively
up
at
the
immense
which
faced
her
as
she
sat
at
the
in
her
spacious
and
opulent
sir
jehoshaphat
made
no
remark
despite
lady
dain
animadversions
upon
it
despite
the
undoubted
fact
that
it
was
generally
disliked
in
the
five
towns
the
portrait
had
cost
a
thousand
pounds
some
said
guineas
and
though
not
yet
two
years
old
it
was
probably
worth
at
least
fifteen
hundred
in
the
picture
market
for
it
was
a
cressage
and
not
only
was
it
a
cressage
it
was
one
of
the
finest
cressages
in
existence
it
marked
the
summit
of
sir
jehoshaphat
career
sir
career
was
perhaps
the
most
successful
and
brilliant
in
the
entire
social
history
of
the
five
towns
this
famous
man
was
the
principal
partner
in
dain
brothers
his
brother
was
dead
but
two
of
sir
sons
were
in
the
firm
dain
brothers
were
the
largest
manufacturers
of
cheap
earthenware
in
the
district
catering
chiefly
for
the
american
and
colonial
buyer
they
had
an
extremely
bad
reputation
for
cutting
prices
they
were
hated
by
every
other
firm
in
the
five
towns
and
to
hear
rival
manufacturers
talk
one
would
gather
the
impression
that
sir
jee
had
acquired
a
tremendous
fortune
by
systematically
selling
goods
under
cost
they
were
also
hated
by
between
eighteen
and
nineteen
hundred
employees
but
such
hatred
however
virulent
had
not
marred
the
progress
of
sir
jee
career
he
had
meant
to
make
a
name
and
he
had
made
it
the
five
towns
might
laugh
at
his
vulgar
snobbishness
the
five
towns
might
sneer
at
his
calculated
philanthropy
but
he
was
nevertheless
the
man
in
the
five
towns
and
it
was
precisely
his
snobbishness
and
his
philanthropy
which
had
carried
him
to
the
top
moreover
he
had
been
the
first
public
man
in
the
five
towns
to
gain
a
knighthood
the
five
towns
could
not
deny
that
it
was
very
proud
indeed
of
this
knighthood
the
means
by
which
he
had
won
this
distinction
were
neither
here
nor
there
he
had
won
it
and
was
he
not
the
father
of
his
native
borough
had
he
not
been
three
times
mayor
of
his
native
borough
was
not
the
whole
northern
half
of
the
county
dotted
and
spangled
by
his
benefactions
his
institutions
his
endowments
and
it
could
not
be
denied
that
he
sometimes
tickled
the
five
towns
as
the
five
towns
likes
being
tickled
there
was
for
example
the
notorious
sneyd
incident
sneyd
hall
belonging
to
the
earl
of
chell
lies
a
few
miles
south
of
the
five
towns
and
from
it
the
pretty
countess
of
chell
exercises
that
condescending
meddlesomeness
which
so
frequently
exasperates
the
five
towns
sir
jee
had
got
his
title
by
the
aid
of
the
iris
as
she
is
locally
dubbed
shortly
afterwards
he
had
contrived
to
quarrel
with
the
countess
and
the
quarrel
was
conducted
by
sir
jee
as
a
quarrel
between
equals
which
delighted
the
district
sir
jee
final
word
in
it
had
been
to
buy
a
sizable
tract
of
land
near
sneyd
village
just
off
the
sneyd
estate
and
to
erect
thereon
a
mansion
quite
as
imposing
as
sneyd
hall
and
far
more
up
to
date
and
to
call
the
mansion
sneyd
castle
a
mighty
stroke
iris
was
furious
the
earl
speechless
with
fury
but
they
could
do
nothing
naturally
the
five
towns
was
tickled
it
was
apropos
of
the
of
sneyd
castle
also
of
the
completion
of
his
third
mayoralty
and
of
the
inauguration
of
the
dain
technical
institute
that
the
movement
had
been
started
primarily
by
a
few
toadies
for
tendering
to
sir
jee
a
popular
gift
worthy
to
express
the
profound
esteem
in
which
he
was
officially
held
in
the
five
towns
it
having
been
generally
felt
that
the
gift
should
take
the
form
of
a
portrait
a
local
dilettante
had
suggested
cressage
and
when
the
five
towns
had
inquired
into
cressage
and
discovered
that
that
genius
from
the
united
states
was
celebrated
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
regarded
as
the
equal
of
velazquez
whoever
velazquez
might
be
and
that
he
had
painted
half
the
aristocracy
and
that
his
income
was
regal
the
suggestion
was
accepted
and
cressage
was
approached
cressage
haughtily
consented
to
paint
sir
jee
portrait
on
his
usual
conditions
namely
that
the
sitter
should
go
to
the
little
village
in
bedfordshire
where
cressage
had
his
principal
studio
and
that
the
painting
should
be
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
before
being
shown
anywhere
else
cressage
was
an
but
no
one
thought
of
putting
after
his
name
he
was
so
big
that
instead
of
the
royal
academy
conferring
distinction
on
him
he
conferred
distinction
on
the
royal
academy
sir
jee
went
to
bedfordshire
and
was
rapidly
painted
and
he
came
back
gloomy
the
presentation
committee
went
to
bedfordshire
later
to
inspect
the
portrait
and
they
too
came
back
gloomy
then
the
academy
exhibition
opened
and
the
portrait
showing
sir
jee
in
his
robe
and
chain
and
in
a
chair
was
instantly
hailed
as
possibly
the
most
glorious
masterpiece
of
modern
times
all
the
critics
were
of
one
accord
the
committee
and
sir
jee
were
reassured
but
only
partially
and
sir
jee
rather
less
so
than
the
committee
for
there
was
something
in
the
enthusiastic
criticism
which
gravely
disturbed
him
an
enlightened
generation
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
dazzling
yearly
succession
of
cressage
portraits
need
not
be
told
what
this
something
was
one
critic
wrote
that
cressage
displayed
even
more
than
his
astounding
insight
into
character
another
critic
wrote
that
cressage
observation
was
as
usual
and
coldly
hostile
another
referred
to
the
provincial
mayor
immortalized
for
the
diversion
of
future
ages
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
went
to
london
to
see
the
work
for
which
they
had
subscribed
and
they
saw
a
mean
little
old
man
with
thin
lips
and
a
straggling
grey
beard
and
shifty
eyes
and
pushful
snob
written
all
over
him
ridiculous
in
his
gewgaws
of
office
when
you
looked
at
the
picture
close
to
it
was
a
meaningless
mass
of
coloured
smudges
but
when
you
stood
fifteen
feet
away
from
it
the
portrait
was
absolutely
lifelike
amazing
miraculous
it
was
so
wondrously
lifelike
that
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
burst
out
laughing
many
people
felt
sorry
not
for
sir
jee
but
for
lady
dain
lady
dain
was
beloved
and
genuinely
respected
she
was
a
simple
homely
sincere
woman
her
one
weakness
being
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
see
through
sir
jee
of
course
at
the
presentation
ceremony
the
portrait
had
been
ecstatically
referred
to
as
a
possession
precious
for
ever
and
the
recipient
and
his
wife
pretended
to
be
overflowing
with
pure
joy
in
the
ownership
of
it
it
had
been
hanging
in
the
of
sneyd
castle
about
sixteen
months
when
lady
dain
told
her
husband
that
it
would
ultimately
drive
her
into
the
lunatic
asylum
be
silly
wife
said
sir
jee
would
part
with
that
portrait
for
ten
times
what
it
cost
this
was
to
speak
bluntly
a
downright
lie
sir
jee
secretly
hated
the
portrait
more
than
anyone
hated
it
he
would
have
been
almost
ready
to
burn
down
sneyd
castle
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
thing
but
it
happened
that
on
the
previous
evening
in
the
conversation
with
the
magistrates
clerk
his
receptive
brain
had
been
visited
by
a
less
expensive
scheme
than
burning
down
the
castle
lady
dain
sighed
you
going
to
town
early
she
inquired
he
replied
on
the
rota
today
he
was
chairman
of
the
borough
bench
of
magistrates
as
he
drove
into
town
he
revolved
his
scheme
and
thought
it
wild
and
dangerous
but
still
feasible
ii
on
the
bench
that
morning
sir
jee
shocked
mr
sherratt
the
clerk
and
he
utterly
disgusted
mr
bourne
superintendent
of
the
borough
police
i
do
not
intend
to
name
the
name
of
the
borough
whether
bursley
hanbridge
knype
longshaw
or
turnhill
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
will
know
without
being
told
the
rest
of
the
world
has
no
right
to
know
there
had
recently
occurred
a
somewhat
thrilling
series
of
burglaries
in
the
district
and
the
burglars
a
gang
of
them
was
presumed
had
escaped
the
solicitous
attentions
of
the
police
but
on
the
previous
afternoon
an
underling
of
mr
bourne
had
caught
a
man
who
was
generally
believed
to
be
wholly
or
partly
responsible
for
the
burglaries
the
five
towns
breathed
with
relief
and
congratulated
mr
bourne
and
mr
bourne
was
well
pleased
with
himself
the
staffordshire
signal
headed
the
item
of
news
capture
of
a
supposed
burglar
the
supposed
burglar
gave
his
name
as
william
smith
and
otherwise
behaved
in
an
extremely
suspicious
manner
now
sir
jee
sitting
as
chief
magistrate
in
the
actually
dismissed
the
charge
against
the
man
overruling
his
sole
colleague
on
the
bench
that
morning
alderman
easton
he
dismissed
the
charge
against
william
smith
holding
that
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
was
insufficient
to
justify
even
a
remand
no
wonder
that
mr
bourne
was
discouraged
not
to
say
angry
no
wonder
that
that
pillar
of
the
law
mr
sherratt
was
pained
and
shocked
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
sir
jehoshaphat
said
that
he
would
be
glad
to
speak
with
william
smith
afterwards
in
the
magistrates
room
indicating
that
he
sympathized
with
william
smith
and
wished
to
exercise
upon
william
smith
his
renowned
philanthropy
and
so
at
about
noon
when
the
court
majestically
rose
sir
jee
retired
to
the
magistrates
room
where
the
humble
alderman
easton
was
discreet
enough
not
to
follow
him
and
awaited
william
smith
and
william
smith
came
guided
thither
by
a
policeman
to
whom
in
parting
from
him
he
made
a
rude
surreptitious
gesture
sir
jee
seated
in
the
which
dominates
the
other
chairs
round
the
elm
table
in
the
magistrates
room
emitted
a
preliminary
cough
he
said
sternly
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
were
very
fortunate
this
morning
you
know
and
he
gazed
at
smith
smith
stood
near
the
door
cap
in
hand
he
did
not
resemble
a
burglar
who
surely
ought
to
be
big
muscular
and
masterful
he
resembled
an
undersized
clerk
who
has
been
out
of
work
for
a
long
time
but
who
has
nevertheless
found
the
means
to
eat
and
drink
rather
plenteously
he
was
clothed
in
a
very
shabby
suit
frayed
at
the
wrists
and
ankles
and
greasy
in
front
his
linen
collar
was
brown
with
dirt
his
fingers
were
dirty
his
hair
was
unkempt
and
long
and
a
young
and
lusty
black
beard
was
sprouting
on
his
chin
his
boots
were
not
at
all
pleasant
governor
smith
replied
lightly
with
a
manchester
accent
what
your
game
sir
jee
was
taken
aback
he
the
chairman
of
the
borough
bench
and
the
leading
philanthropist
in
the
country
to
be
so
spoken
to
but
what
could
he
do
he
himself
had
legally
established
smith
innocence
smith
was
as
free
as
air
and
had
a
perfect
right
to
adopt
any
tone
he
chose
to
any
man
he
chose
and
sir
jee
desired
a
service
from
william
smith
was
hoping
i
might
be
of
use
to
you
said
sir
jehoshaphat
diplomatically
said
smith
all
right
that
is
but
none
of
your
philanthropic
dodges
you
know
i
do
want
to
lead
a
new
life
and
i
do
want
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
i
do
want
a
helpin
hand
nor
none
o
those
things
and
what
more
i
do
want
a
situation
i
got
all
the
situation
as
i
need
but
i
never
refuse
money
nor
beer
neither
never
did
and
i
forty
years
old
next
month
suppose
burgling
does
pay
very
well
does
it
sir
jee
boldly
ventured
william
smith
laughed
coarsely
pays
right
enough
said
he
i
do
put
my
money
on
my
back
governor
i
put
it
into
a
bit
of
property
when
i
get
the
chance
may
pay
said
sir
jee
it
is
wrong
it
is
very
it
indeed
smith
returned
dryly
is
it
well
heard
it
called
plenty
o
things
in
my
time
but
never
that
now
i
should
have
called
it
quite
sociablelike
sort
of
making
free
with
strangers
and
so
on
however
he
added
come
across
a
cove
once
as
told
me
crime
was
nothing
but
a
disease
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
such
i
asked
him
for
a
dozen
o
port
but
he
never
sent
it
been
caught
before
sir
jee
inquired
much
smith
exclaimed
this
be
a
lesson
to
me
i
can
tell
you
now
what
are
you
getting
at
governor
because
my
time
money
my
time
is
sir
jee
coughed
once
more
down
said
sir
jee
and
william
smith
sat
down
opposite
to
him
at
the
table
and
put
his
shiny
elbows
on
the
table
precisely
in
the
manner
of
sir
jee
elbows
he
cheerfully
encouraged
sir
jee
would
you
like
to
commit
a
burglary
that
was
not
a
crime
said
sir
jee
his
shifty
eyes
wandering
around
the
room
perfectly
lawful
burglary
are
you
getting
at
william
smith
was
genuinely
astonished
my
residence
sneyd
castle
sir
jee
proceeded
a
large
portrait
of
myself
in
the
that
i
want
to
have
stolen
you
understand
i
want
to
get
rid
of
it
and
i
want
er
people
to
think
that
it
has
been
stolen
why
do
you
stop
up
one
night
and
steal
it
yourself
and
then
burn
it
william
smith
suggested
would
be
deceitful
said
sir
jee
gravely
could
not
tell
my
friends
that
the
portrait
had
been
stolen
if
it
had
not
been
stolen
the
burglary
must
be
entirely
genuine
the
figure
said
smith
curtly
are
you
going
to
give
me
for
the
job
you
for
doing
the
job
sir
jee
repeated
his
secret
and
ineradicable
meanness
aroused
you
why
i
giving
you
the
opportunity
to
honestly
steal
a
picture
that
worth
over
a
thousand
pounds
i
dare
say
it
would
be
worth
two
thousand
pounds
in
america
and
you
want
to
be
paid
into
the
bargain
do
you
know
my
man
that
people
come
all
the
way
from
manchester
and
even
london
to
see
that
portrait
he
told
smith
about
the
painting
why
are
you
in
such
a
stew
to
be
rid
of
it
queried
the
burglar
my
affair
said
sir
jee
do
like
it
lady
dain
like
it
but
it
a
presentation
portrait
and
so
i
ca
you
see
mr
smith
how
am
i
going
to
dispose
of
it
when
i
got
it
smith
demanded
ca
melt
a
portrait
down
as
if
it
was
silver
by
what
you
say
governor
it
known
all
over
the
blessed
world
seems
to
me
i
might
just
as
well
try
to
sell
the
nelson
column
nonsense
said
sir
jee
you
sell
it
in
america
quite
easily
it
be
a
fortune
to
you
keep
it
for
a
year
first
and
then
send
it
to
new
york
william
smith
shook
his
head
and
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
then
quite
suddenly
he
brightened
and
said
right
governor
i
take
it
on
just
to
oblige
you
can
you
do
it
asked
sir
jee
hardly
concealing
his
joy
said
smith
mysteriously
engaged
tonight
tomorrow
night
tomorrow
i
engaged
tomorrow
too
seem
to
be
very
much
engaged
my
man
sir
jee
observed
do
you
expect
smith
retorted
is
business
i
could
do
it
the
night
after
tomorrow
that
christmas
eve
sir
jee
protested
if
it
is
christmas
eve
said
smith
coldly
you
prefer
christmas
day
i
engaged
on
boxing
day
and
the
day
after
in
the
five
towns
i
trust
sir
jee
remarked
said
smith
shortly
five
towns
is
about
sucked
dry
the
affair
was
arranged
for
christmas
eve
sir
jee
suggested
i
draw
you
a
plan
of
the
castle
so
that
you
can
william
smith
face
expressed
terrific
scorn
you
suppose
he
said
i
have
had
plans
o
your
castle
ever
since
it
was
built
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
not
a
blooming
excursionist
i
not
a
business
man
that
what
i
am
sir
jee
was
snubbed
and
he
agreed
submissively
to
all
william
arrangements
for
the
innocent
burglary
he
perceived
that
in
william
smith
he
had
stumbled
on
a
professional
of
the
highest
class
and
this
good
fortune
pleased
him
only
one
thing
that
riles
me
said
smith
in
parting
that
is
that
you
go
and
say
that
after
you
done
everything
you
could
for
me
i
went
and
burgled
your
castle
and
you
talk
about
the
ingratitude
of
the
lower
classes
i
know
you
governor
iii
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
december
sir
jehoshaphat
drove
home
to
sneyd
castle
from
the
principal
of
the
three
dain
manufactories
and
found
lady
dain
superintending
the
work
of
packing
up
trunks
he
and
she
were
to
quit
the
castle
that
afternoon
in
order
to
spend
christmas
on
the
other
side
of
the
five
towns
under
the
roof
of
their
eldest
son
john
who
had
a
new
house
a
new
wife
and
a
new
baby
male
john
was
a
domineering
person
and
being
rather
proud
of
his
house
and
all
that
was
his
he
had
obstinately
decided
to
have
his
own
christmas
at
his
own
hearth
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
drawn
by
the
irresistible
attraction
of
that
novelty
a
grandson
though
mrs
john
had
declined
to
have
the
little
thing
named
jehoshaphat
had
yielded
to
solicitations
and
the
family
gathering
for
the
first
time
in
history
was
not
to
occur
round
sir
jee
mahogany
sir
jee
very
characteristically
said
nothing
to
lady
dain
immediately
he
allowed
her
to
proceed
with
the
packing
of
the
trunks
and
then
tea
was
served
and
as
the
time
was
approaching
for
the
carriage
to
come
round
to
take
them
to
the
station
at
last
he
suddenly
remarked
sha
be
able
to
go
with
you
to
john
this
afternoon
jee
she
exclaimed
you
are
tiresome
why
could
you
tell
me
before
will
come
over
tomorrow
morning
perhaps
in
time
for
church
he
proceeded
ignoring
her
demand
for
an
explanation
he
always
did
ignore
her
demand
for
an
explanation
indeed
she
only
asked
for
explanations
in
a
mechanical
and
perfunctory
manner
she
had
long
since
ceased
to
expect
them
sir
jee
had
been
born
like
that
devious
mysterious
incalculable
and
lady
dain
accepted
him
as
he
was
she
was
somewhat
surprised
therefore
when
he
went
on
have
some
minutes
of
committee
meetings
that
i
really
must
go
carefully
through
and
send
off
tonight
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
be
no
chance
of
doing
that
at
john
i
telegraphed
to
john
he
was
obviously
nervous
and
no
food
in
the
house
sighed
lady
dain
the
servants
are
all
going
away
except
callear
and
he
ca
cook
your
dinner
tonight
i
think
i
better
stay
myself
and
look
after
you
do
no
such
thing
said
sir
jee
decisively
for
my
dinner
anything
will
do
for
that
the
servants
have
been
promised
their
holiday
to
start
from
this
evening
and
they
must
have
it
i
can
manage
here
spoke
the
philanthropist
with
his
unshakable
sense
of
justice
so
lady
dain
departed
anxious
and
worried
having
previously
arranged
something
cold
for
sir
jee
in
the
and
instructed
callear
about
boiling
the
water
for
sir
jee
tea
on
christmas
morning
callear
was
the
and
a
useful
odd
man
he
it
was
who
would
drive
sir
jee
to
the
station
on
christmas
morning
and
then
guard
the
castle
and
the
stables
thereof
during
the
absence
of
the
family
and
the
other
servants
callear
slept
over
the
stables
and
after
sir
jee
had
consumed
his
cold
repast
in
the
the
other
servants
went
and
sir
jee
was
alone
in
the
castle
facing
the
portrait
he
had
managed
the
affair
fairly
well
he
thought
indeed
he
had
a
talent
for
chicane
and
none
knew
it
better
than
himself
it
would
have
been
dangerous
if
the
servants
had
been
left
in
the
castle
they
might
have
suffered
from
insomnia
and
heard
william
smith
and
interfered
with
the
operations
of
william
smith
on
the
other
hand
sir
jee
had
no
intention
whatever
of
leaving
the
castle
uninhabited
to
the
mercies
of
william
smith
he
felt
that
he
himself
must
be
on
the
spot
to
see
that
everything
went
right
and
that
nothing
went
wrong
thus
the
scheme
for
the
servants
holiday
fitted
perfectly
into
his
plans
and
all
that
he
had
had
to
do
was
to
refuse
to
leave
the
castle
till
the
morrow
it
was
ideal
nevertheless
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
what
he
had
done
and
of
what
he
was
going
to
permit
william
smith
to
do
it
was
certainly
dangerous
certainly
rather
a
wild
scheme
however
the
die
was
cast
and
within
twelve
hours
he
would
be
relieved
of
the
intolerable
incubus
of
the
portrait
and
when
he
thought
of
the
humiliations
which
that
portrait
had
caused
him
when
he
remembered
the
remarks
of
his
sons
concerning
it
especially
john
remarks
when
he
recalled
phrases
about
it
in
london
newspapers
he
squirmed
and
told
himself
that
no
scheme
for
getting
rid
of
it
could
be
too
wild
and
perilous
and
after
all
the
burglary
dodge
was
the
only
dodge
absolutely
the
only
conceivable
practical
method
of
disposing
of
the
portrait
except
burning
down
the
castle
and
surely
it
was
preferable
to
a
conflagration
to
arson
moreover
in
case
of
fire
at
the
castle
some
blundering
fool
would
be
sure
to
cry
portrait
the
portrait
must
be
saved
and
the
portrait
would
be
saved
he
gazed
at
the
repulsive
hateful
thing
in
the
centre
of
the
lower
part
of
the
massive
gold
frame
was
the
legend
to
sir
jehoshaphat
dain
knight
as
a
mark
of
public
esteem
and
gratitude
etc
he
wondered
if
william
smith
would
steal
the
frame
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
he
would
not
steal
the
frame
in
fact
william
smith
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
steal
that
frame
unless
he
had
an
accomplice
or
so
is
the
last
time
i
shall
see
you
said
sir
jee
to
the
portrait
then
he
unfastened
the
catch
of
one
of
the
windows
in
the
as
per
contract
with
william
smith
turned
out
the
electric
light
and
went
to
bed
in
the
deserted
castle
he
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
it
was
no
part
of
sir
jee
programme
to
sleep
he
intended
to
listen
and
he
did
listen
and
about
two
precisely
the
hour
which
william
smith
had
indicated
he
fancied
he
heard
muffled
and
discreet
noises
then
he
was
sure
that
he
heard
them
william
smith
had
kept
his
word
then
the
noises
ceased
for
a
period
and
then
they
recommenced
sir
jee
restrained
his
curiosity
as
long
as
he
could
and
when
he
could
restrain
it
no
more
he
rose
and
silently
opened
his
bedroom
window
and
put
his
head
out
into
the
nipping
night
air
of
christmas
and
by
good
fortune
he
saw
the
vast
oblong
of
the
picture
carefully
enveloped
in
sheets
being
passed
by
a
couple
of
dark
figures
through
the
window
to
the
garden
outside
william
smith
had
a
colleague
then
and
he
was
taking
the
frame
as
well
as
the
canvas
sir
jee
watched
the
men
disappear
down
the
avenue
and
they
did
not
reappear
sir
jee
returned
to
bed
yes
he
felt
himself
equal
to
facing
it
out
with
his
family
and
friends
he
felt
himself
equal
to
pretending
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
burglary
having
slept
a
few
hours
he
got
up
early
and
descended
to
the
just
to
see
what
sort
of
a
mess
william
smith
had
made
the
canvas
of
the
portrait
lay
flat
on
the
hearthrug
with
the
following
words
written
on
it
in
chalk
is
no
use
to
me
it
was
the
massive
gold
frame
that
had
gone
further
as
was
later
discovered
all
the
silver
had
gone
not
a
spoon
was
left
in
the
castle
news
of
the
engagement
my
mother
never
came
to
meet
me
at
bursley
station
when
i
arrived
in
the
five
towns
from
london
much
less
did
she
come
as
far
as
knype
station
which
is
the
great
traffic
centre
of
the
district
the
point
at
which
one
changes
from
the
express
into
the
local
train
she
had
always
other
things
to
do
she
was
for
me
so
i
had
the
little
journey
from
knype
to
bursley
and
then
the
walk
up
trafalgar
road
amid
the
familiar
high
chimneys
and
the
smoke
and
the
clayey
mud
and
the
football
posts
and
the
midland
accent
all
by
myself
and
there
was
leisure
to
consider
anew
how
i
should
break
to
my
mother
the
tremendous
news
i
had
for
her
i
had
been
considering
that
question
ever
since
getting
into
the
train
at
euston
where
i
had
said
goodbye
to
agnes
but
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
five
towns
it
seemed
just
slightly
more
difficult
though
of
course
it
was
difficult
really
you
see
i
wrote
to
my
mother
regularly
every
week
telling
her
most
of
my
doings
she
knew
all
my
friends
by
name
i
dare
say
she
formed
in
her
mind
notions
of
what
sort
of
people
they
were
thus
i
had
frequently
mentioned
agnes
and
her
family
in
my
letters
but
you
write
even
to
your
mother
and
say
in
cold
blood
think
i
am
beginning
to
fall
in
love
with
agnes
think
agnes
likes
me
am
mad
on
her
feel
certain
she
likes
me
shall
propose
to
her
on
such
a
day
you
ca
do
that
at
least
i
could
hence
it
had
come
about
that
on
the
of
december
i
had
proposed
to
agnes
and
been
accepted
by
agnes
and
my
mother
had
no
suspicion
that
my
happiness
was
so
near
and
on
the
by
a
previous
and
unalterable
arrangement
i
had
come
to
spend
christmas
with
my
mother
i
was
the
only
son
of
a
widow
i
was
all
that
my
mother
had
and
lo
i
had
gone
and
engaged
myself
to
a
girl
she
had
never
seen
and
i
had
kept
her
in
the
dark
she
would
certainly
be
extremely
surprised
and
she
might
be
a
little
bit
hurt
just
at
first
anyhow
the
situation
was
the
least
in
the
world
delicate
i
walked
up
the
whitened
front
steps
of
my
mother
little
house
just
opposite
where
the
electric
cars
stop
but
before
i
could
put
my
hand
on
the
bell
my
little
plump
mother
in
her
black
silk
and
her
gold
brooch
and
her
auburn
hair
opened
to
me
having
doubtless
watched
me
down
the
road
from
the
as
usual
and
she
said
as
usual
kissing
me
philip
how
are
you
and
i
said
i
all
right
mother
how
are
you
i
perceived
instantly
that
she
was
more
excited
than
my
arrival
ordinarily
made
her
there
were
tears
in
her
smiling
eyes
and
she
was
as
nervous
as
a
young
girl
she
did
indeed
look
remarkably
young
for
a
woman
of
with
years
of
widowhood
and
a
brief
but
too
tempestuous
married
life
behind
her
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
some
means
or
other
she
has
got
wind
of
my
engagement
but
how
but
i
said
nothing
i
too
was
naturally
rather
nervous
mothers
are
kittle
cattle
tell
her
at
supper
i
decided
and
she
hovered
round
me
like
a
round
a
steamer
as
i
went
upstairs
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
she
flew
instead
of
letting
the
servant
go
it
was
a
porter
with
my
bag
just
as
i
was
coming
again
there
was
another
ring
at
the
door
and
my
mother
appeared
magically
out
of
the
kitchen
but
i
was
beforehand
with
her
and
with
a
laugh
i
insisted
on
opening
the
front
door
myself
this
time
a
young
woman
stood
on
the
step
mrs
dawson
wants
to
know
if
mrs
durance
can
kindly
lend
her
knives
and
forks
with
pleasure
said
my
mother
behind
me
wait
a
minute
lucy
come
inside
on
the
mat
i
followed
my
mother
into
the
where
she
kept
her
silver
in
a
cabinet
mrs
dawson
new
servant
my
mother
whispered
she
need
think
i
going
to
lend
her
my
best
because
i
not
should
if
i
were
you
i
supported
her
and
she
went
out
with
some
in
tissue
paper
and
beamed
on
mrs
dawson
servant
with
an
assumed
benevolence
she
exclaimed
the
compliments
of
the
season
to
your
mistress
lucy
after
that
my
mother
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
to
worry
an
entirely
capable
servant
and
i
roamed
about
feeling
happily
excited
examining
the
in
which
nothing
was
changed
except
the
incandescent
light
and
the
picture
postcards
on
the
mantelpiece
then
i
wandered
into
the
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
here
an
immense
surprise
awaited
me
supper
was
set
for
three
i
reflected
a
nice
state
of
affairs
supper
for
three
and
she
has
breathed
a
word
my
mother
was
so
clever
in
social
matters
and
especially
in
the
planning
of
delicious
surprises
that
i
believed
her
capable
even
of
miracles
in
some
way
or
other
she
must
have
discovered
the
state
of
my
desires
towards
agnes
she
had
written
or
something
she
and
agnes
had
been
plotting
together
by
letter
to
startle
me
and
perhaps
telegraphing
agnes
had
fibbed
in
telling
me
that
she
could
not
possibly
come
to
bursley
for
christmas
she
had
delightfully
fibbed
and
my
mother
had
got
her
concealed
somewhere
in
the
house
or
was
momentarily
expecting
her
that
explained
the
tears
the
nervousness
the
rushes
to
the
door
i
crept
out
of
the
determined
not
to
let
my
mother
know
that
i
had
secretly
viewed
the
and
as
i
was
crossing
the
lobby
to
the
there
was
a
third
ring
at
the
door
and
a
third
time
my
mother
rushed
out
of
the
kitchen
jove
i
thought
it
agnes
what
a
scene
and
trembling
with
expectation
i
opened
the
door
it
was
mr
nixon
now
mr
nixon
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
a
man
of
or
fifty
with
a
reputation
for
shrewdness
and
increasing
wealth
he
owned
a
hundred
and
cottages
in
the
town
having
bought
them
gradually
in
and
in
rows
he
collected
the
rents
himself
and
attended
to
the
repairs
himself
and
was
celebrated
as
a
good
landlord
and
as
being
almost
the
only
man
in
bursley
who
had
made
cottage
property
pay
he
lived
alone
in
commerce
street
and
though
not
talkative
was
usually
jolly
with
one
or
two
good
stories
tucked
away
in
the
corners
of
his
memory
he
was
my
mother
trustee
and
had
morally
aided
her
in
the
troublous
times
before
my
father
early
death
young
man
cried
he
you
back
in
owd
bosley
it
amused
him
to
speak
the
dialect
a
little
occasionally
and
he
brought
his
burly
powerful
form
into
the
lobby
i
greeted
him
as
jovially
as
i
could
and
then
he
shook
hands
with
my
mother
neither
of
them
speaking
nixon
is
come
for
supper
philip
said
my
mother
i
liked
mr
nixon
but
i
was
not
too
well
pleased
by
this
information
for
i
wanted
to
talk
confidentially
to
my
mother
i
had
a
task
before
me
with
my
mother
and
here
mr
nixon
was
plunging
into
the
supper
i
could
not
break
it
gently
to
my
mother
that
i
was
engaged
to
a
strange
young
woman
in
the
presence
of
mr
nixon
mr
nixon
had
been
in
to
supper
several
times
during
previous
visits
of
mine
but
never
on
the
first
night
however
i
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
we
sat
down
and
began
on
the
ham
the
sausages
the
eggs
the
crumpets
the
toast
the
jams
the
the
stilton
and
the
celery
but
we
none
of
us
ate
very
much
despite
my
little
plump
mother
protestations
my
suspicion
was
that
perhaps
something
had
gone
slightly
wrong
with
my
mother
affairs
and
that
mr
nixon
was
taking
the
first
opportunity
to
explain
things
to
me
but
such
a
possibility
did
not
interest
me
for
i
could
easily
afford
to
keep
my
mother
and
a
wife
too
i
was
still
preoccupied
in
my
engagement
and
surely
there
is
nothing
astonishing
in
that
and
i
began
to
compose
the
words
in
which
immediately
on
the
departure
of
mr
nixon
after
supper
i
would
tackle
my
mother
on
the
subject
when
we
had
reached
the
stilton
and
celery
i
intimated
that
i
must
walk
down
to
the
as
i
had
to
dispatch
a
letter
it
do
tomorrow
my
pet
asked
my
mother
will
not
i
said
imagine
leaving
agnes
two
days
without
news
of
my
safe
arrival
and
without
assurances
of
my
love
i
had
started
writing
the
letter
in
the
train
near
willesden
and
i
finished
it
in
the
lady
in
the
case
mr
nixon
called
out
gaily
i
replied
with
firmness
i
went
forth
bought
a
picture
postcard
showing
st
luke
square
bursley
most
untruthfully
picturesque
and
posted
the
card
and
the
letter
to
my
darling
agnes
i
hoped
that
mr
nixon
would
have
departed
ere
my
return
he
had
made
no
reference
at
all
during
supper
to
my
mother
affairs
but
he
had
not
departed
i
found
him
solitary
in
the
smoking
a
very
fine
cigar
the
mater
i
demanded
just
gone
out
of
the
room
he
said
and
sit
down
have
a
weed
i
want
a
bit
of
a
chat
with
you
philip
i
obeyed
taking
one
of
the
very
fine
cigars
uncle
nixon
i
encouraged
him
wishing
to
get
the
chat
over
because
my
mind
was
full
of
agnes
i
sometimes
called
him
uncle
for
fun
my
boy
he
began
no
use
me
beating
about
the
bush
what
do
you
think
of
me
as
a
stepfather
i
was
struck
as
they
say
down
there
all
of
a
heap
i
stammered
do
mean
to
say
you
and
mother
he
nodded
i
do
lad
yesterday
she
promised
as
she
marry
my
unworthy
self
it
been
coming
along
for
some
time
but
i
do
expect
given
you
any
hint
in
her
letters
in
fact
i
know
she
has
it
would
have
been
rather
difficult
would
it
she
could
well
have
written
my
dear
philip
an
old
friend
mr
nixon
is
falling
in
love
with
me
and
i
believe
i
falling
in
love
with
him
one
of
these
days
he
be
proposing
to
me
she
could
have
written
like
that
could
she
i
laughed
i
could
not
help
it
hands
i
said
warmly
delighted
and
soon
afterwards
my
mother
sidled
in
shyly
lad
delighted
sarah
said
mr
nixon
shortly
i
said
nothing
about
my
own
engagement
that
night
i
had
never
thought
of
my
mother
as
a
woman
with
a
future
i
had
never
realized
that
she
was
desirable
and
that
a
man
might
desire
her
and
that
her
lonely
existence
in
that
house
was
not
all
that
she
had
the
right
to
demand
from
life
and
i
was
ashamed
of
my
characteristic
filial
selfish
egoism
so
i
decided
that
i
would
not
intrude
my
joys
on
hers
until
the
next
morning
we
live
and
learn
beginning
the
new
year
i
we
are
a
stolid
and
a
taciturn
race
we
of
the
five
towns
it
may
be
because
we
are
geographically
so
self
contained
or
it
may
be
because
we
work
in
clay
and
iron
or
it
may
merely
be
because
it
is
our
nature
to
be
stolid
and
taciturn
but
stolid
and
taciturn
we
are
and
some
of
the
instances
of
our
stolidity
and
our
taciturnity
are
enough
to
astound
they
do
not
of
course
astound
us
natives
we
laugh
at
them
we
think
they
are
an
immense
joke
and
what
the
outer
world
may
think
does
not
trouble
our
deep
conceit
of
ourselves
i
have
often
wondered
what
would
be
the
effect
other
than
an
effect
of
astonishment
on
the
outer
world
of
one
of
these
narratives
illustrating
our
five
towns
peculiarities
of
deportment
and
i
intend
for
the
first
time
in
history
to
make
such
a
narrative
public
property
i
have
purposely
not
chosen
an
extreme
example
just
an
average
example
you
will
see
how
it
strikes
you
toby
hall
once
a
burgess
of
turnhill
the
northernmost
and
smallest
of
the
five
towns
was
passing
last
new
year
eve
through
the
district
by
train
on
his
way
from
crewe
to
derby
he
lived
at
derby
and
he
was
returning
from
the
funeral
of
a
brother
member
of
the
ancient
order
of
foresters
at
crewe
he
got
out
of
the
train
at
knype
the
great
railway
centre
of
the
five
towns
to
have
a
glass
of
beer
in
the
it
being
new
year
eve
the
traffic
was
heavy
and
disorganized
especially
in
the
and
when
toby
hall
emerged
on
to
the
platform
again
the
train
was
already
on
the
move
toby
was
neither
young
nor
active
his
years
were
fifty
and
on
account
of
the
funeral
he
wore
broadcloth
and
a
silk
hat
and
his
overcoat
was
new
and
encumbering
impossible
to
take
a
flying
leap
into
the
train
he
missed
the
train
and
then
he
reflectively
stroked
his
short
grey
beard
he
had
no
moustache
and
his
upper
lip
was
very
long
and
then
he
smoothed
down
his
new
overcoat
over
his
rotund
form
man
he
asked
a
porter
next
train
derby
way
none
afore
tomorrow
toby
went
and
had
another
glass
of
beer
d
if
i
do
go
to
turnhill
he
said
to
himself
slowly
and
calmly
as
he
paid
for
the
second
glass
of
beer
he
crossed
the
station
by
the
subway
and
waited
for
the
train
to
turnhill
he
had
not
set
foot
in
the
five
towns
for
years
having
indeed
carefully
and
continuously
avoided
it
as
a
man
will
avoid
the
street
where
his
creditor
lives
but
he
discovered
no
change
in
knype
and
he
had
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
fact
that
he
knew
his
way
about
it
knew
where
the
trains
started
from
and
other
interesting
little
details
even
the
special
form
of
the
pasted
here
and
there
on
the
walls
of
the
station
had
not
varied
since
his
youth
we
return
radicals
to
parliament
but
we
are
proud
of
a
railway
which
for
fine
old
english
conservatism
brooks
no
rival
toby
gazed
around
half
challengingly
and
half
nervously
it
was
conceivable
that
he
might
be
recognized
or
might
recognize
but
no
not
a
soul
in
the
vast
swaying
preoccupied
crowds
gave
him
a
glance
as
for
him
although
he
fully
recognized
nobody
yet
nearly
every
face
seemed
to
be
he
climbed
into
a
compartment
when
the
train
drew
up
and
ten
other
people
all
with
tickets
followed
his
example
three
persons
were
already
seated
therein
the
compartment
was
illuminated
by
one
lamp
and
in
the
bleakridge
tunnel
this
lamp
expired
everything
reminded
him
of
his
youth
in
twenty
minutes
he
was
leaving
turnhill
station
and
entering
the
town
it
was
about
nine
and
colder
than
winters
of
the
period
usually
are
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
an
electric
tram
and
the
second
thing
he
saw
was
another
electric
tram
in
toby
time
there
were
no
trams
at
turnhill
and
the
then
between
bursley
and
longshaw
long
since
superseded
were
regarded
as
the
final
marvel
of
science
as
applied
to
traction
and
now
there
were
electric
trams
at
turnhill
the
railway
renewed
his
youth
but
this
darting
electricity
showed
him
how
old
he
was
the
town
hall
which
was
when
he
left
turnhill
had
the
look
of
a
mediaeval
hotel
de
ville
as
he
examined
it
in
the
glamour
of
the
incandescent
gas
and
it
was
no
more
the
sole
impressive
pile
in
the
borough
the
high
street
and
its
precincts
abounded
in
impressive
piles
he
did
not
know
precisely
what
they
were
but
they
had
the
appearance
of
being
markets
libraries
baths
and
similar
haunts
of
luxury
one
was
a
bank
he
thought
that
turnhill
high
street
compared
very
well
with
derby
he
would
have
preferred
it
to
be
less
changed
if
the
high
street
was
thus
changed
everything
would
be
changed
including
child
row
the
sole
phenomenon
that
recalled
his
youth
except
the
town
hall
was
the
peculiar
smell
of
oranges
and
apples
floating
out
on
the
frosty
air
from
greengrocers
shops
he
passed
through
the
market
square
noting
that
sinister
freak
the
jubilee
tower
and
came
to
child
row
the
first
building
on
your
right
as
you
enter
child
row
from
the
square
is
the
primitive
methodist
chapel
yes
it
was
still
there
primitive
methodism
had
not
failed
in
turnhill
because
toby
hall
had
deserted
the
cause
years
ago
but
something
serious
had
happened
to
the
structure
gradually
toby
realized
that
its
old
face
had
been
taken
out
and
a
new
one
put
in
the
classic
pillars
had
vanished
and
a
series
of
gothic
arches
had
been
substituted
by
way
of
portico
a
pretty
idea
but
not
to
toby
liking
it
was
another
change
another
change
he
crossed
the
street
and
proceeded
downwards
in
the
obscurity
and
at
length
halted
and
peered
with
his
little
blue
eyes
at
a
small
house
one
of
twins
on
the
other
side
from
where
he
stood
that
house
at
any
rate
was
unchanged
it
was
a
house
with
a
semicircular
fanlight
over
a
warped
door
of
grained
panelling
the
blind
of
the
window
to
the
left
of
the
door
was
irradiated
from
within
proving
habitation
wonder
ran
toby
thought
and
he
unhesitatingly
crossed
the
street
again
towards
it
feeling
first
for
the
depth
of
the
kerbstone
with
his
umbrella
he
had
a
particular
and
special
interest
in
that
house
no
it
was
and
is
for
years
ago
he
had
married
it
ii
years
ago
toby
hall
i
need
not
say
that
his
proper
christian
name
was
tobias
had
married
miss
priscilla
bratt
then
a
calm
and
young
woman
of
and
priscilla
had
the
house
together
with
a
certain
income
under
the
will
of
her
father
the
marriage
was
not
the
result
of
burning
passion
on
either
side
it
was
a
union
of
two
respectabilities
and
it
might
have
succeeded
as
well
as
such
unions
generally
do
succeed
if
priscilla
had
not
too
frequently
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
house
they
lived
in
was
hers
he
knew
that
the
house
was
hers
the
whole
world
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
ownership
of
the
house
and
her
references
to
the
matter
amounted
to
a
lack
of
tact
several
times
toby
had
indicated
as
much
but
priscilla
took
no
heed
she
had
the
hide
of
an
alligator
herself
though
a
personable
girl
and
she
assumed
that
her
husband
hide
was
of
similar
stuff
this
assumption
was
justifiable
except
that
in
just
one
spot
the
skin
of
toby
was
tender
he
really
did
not
care
to
be
reminded
that
he
was
living
under
his
wife
roof
the
reiteration
settled
on
his
nerves
like
a
malady
and
before
a
year
had
elapsed
priscilla
had
contrived
to
remind
him
once
too
often
and
one
day
he
put
some
things
in
a
and
a
hat
on
his
head
and
made
for
the
door
the
house
was
antique
and
the
gave
directly
on
to
the
street
be
going
priscilla
asked
him
he
hesitated
a
second
and
said
and
he
was
in
the
five
towns
we
are
apt
to
end
our
marriages
in
that
laconic
manner
toby
did
not
complain
too
much
he
simply
and
unaffectedly
went
it
might
be
imagined
that
the
situation
was
a
trying
one
for
priscilla
not
so
priscilla
had
experienced
marriage
with
toby
and
had
found
it
wanting
she
was
content
to
be
relieved
of
toby
she
had
her
house
and
her
money
and
her
and
also
tranquillity
she
accepted
the
solution
and
devoted
her
days
to
the
cleanliness
of
the
house
toby
drew
all
the
money
he
had
out
of
the
bursley
and
turnhill
permanent
fifty
pounds
benefit
building
society
four
shares
nearly
paid
up
and
set
sail
in
the
adriatic
which
was
then
the
leading
greyhound
of
the
atlantic
for
new
york
from
new
york
he
went
to
trenton
new
jersey
which
is
the
five
towns
of
america
a
man
of
his
skill
in
handling
clay
on
a
wheel
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
wresting
a
good
livelihood
from
trenton
when
he
had
tarried
there
a
year
he
caused
a
letter
to
be
written
to
his
wife
informing
her
that
he
was
dead
he
wished
to
be
quite
free
and
also
we
have
our
feeling
for
justice
he
wished
his
wife
to
be
quite
free
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
had
done
anything
extraordinary
either
in
deserting
his
wife
or
in
forwarding
false
news
of
his
death
he
had
done
the
simple
thing
the
casual
thing
the
blunt
thing
the
thing
that
necessitated
the
minimum
of
talking
he
did
not
intend
to
return
to
england
however
after
a
few
years
he
did
return
to
england
the
cause
of
his
return
is
irrelevant
to
the
history
but
i
may
say
that
it
sprang
from
a
conflict
between
the
five
towns
temperament
and
the
trenton
union
of
earthenware
operatives
such
is
the
power
of
unions
in
the
united
states
that
toby
if
he
wished
to
remain
under
the
federal
flag
had
either
to
yield
or
to
starve
he
would
not
yield
he
changed
his
name
and
came
to
england
strolled
calmly
into
the
crown
porcelain
works
at
derby
one
day
and
there
recommenced
his
career
as
an
artificer
of
earthenware
he
did
well
he
could
easily
earn
four
pounds
a
week
and
had
no
desires
save
in
the
direction
of
not
an
expensive
diversion
he
knew
better
than
to
marry
he
existed
quietly
and
one
year
trod
on
the
heels
of
another
and
carried
him
from
thirty
to
forty
and
forty
to
fifty
and
no
one
found
out
his
identity
though
there
are
several
direct
trains
daily
between
derby
and
knype
and
now
owing
to
the
death
of
a
friend
and
a
glass
of
beer
he
was
in
child
row
crossing
the
street
towards
the
house
whose
ownership
had
caused
him
to
quit
it
he
knocked
on
the
door
with
the
handle
of
his
umbrella
there
was
no
knocker
there
never
had
been
a
knocker
iii
the
door
opened
cautiously
as
such
doors
in
the
five
towns
do
after
a
shooting
of
bolts
and
a
loosing
of
chains
it
opened
to
the
extent
of
about
nine
inches
and
toby
hall
saw
the
face
of
a
woman
eyeing
him
this
mrs
hall
he
asked
sternly
it
ai
mrs
hall
it
mrs
tansley
thowt
the
door
opened
a
little
wider
not
you
tobias
said
the
woman
unmoved
reckon
it
is
though
replied
toby
with
a
difficult
smile
us
exclaimed
the
woman
the
door
oscillated
slightly
under
her
hand
us
she
repeated
and
then
suddenly
happen
better
come
in
tobias
said
tobias
and
he
entered
ye
down
do
said
his
wife
thowt
as
you
were
dead
they
wrote
and
told
me
so
said
tobias
i
am
na
he
sat
down
in
an
near
the
grate
with
its
hobs
at
either
side
he
was
acquainted
with
that
chair
and
it
had
not
appreciably
altered
since
his
departure
the
lastingness
of
furniture
under
fair
treatment
is
astonishing
this
chair
was
uncomfortably
in
exactly
the
same
spot
where
it
had
always
been
uncomfortable
and
the
same
was
draped
over
its
uncompromising
back
toby
put
his
hat
on
the
table
and
leaned
his
umbrella
against
the
his
overcoat
he
retained
same
table
same
same
clock
and
ornaments
on
the
but
a
different
carpet
on
the
floor
and
different
curtains
before
the
window
priscilla
bolted
and
chained
the
door
and
then
she
too
sat
down
her
gown
was
black
with
a
small
black
silk
apron
and
she
was
stout
and
she
wore
felt
slippers
and
moved
with
the
same
gingerly
care
as
toby
himself
did
she
looked
fully
her
years
her
thin
lips
were
firmer
than
ever
it
was
indeed
priscilla
well
she
murmured
but
her
capacity
for
wonder
was
nearly
exhausted
said
toby
with
an
air
that
was
meant
to
be
he
warmed
his
hands
at
the
fire
and
then
rubbed
them
over
the
front
of
his
calves
leaning
forward
ye
come
back
said
priscilla
concurred
toby
there
was
a
pause
weather
we
having
he
muttered
seasonable
priscilla
pointed
out
her
glance
rested
on
a
sprig
of
holly
that
was
tied
under
the
unique
relic
of
christmas
in
the
apartment
another
pause
it
would
be
hazardous
to
guess
what
their
feelings
were
perhaps
their
feelings
were
scarcely
anything
at
all
what
be
the
news
toby
inquired
with
what
passes
in
the
five
towns
for
geniality
she
repeated
as
if
not
immediately
grasping
the
significance
of
the
question
do
know
as
there
any
news
nothing
that
is
hung
on
the
wall
near
the
was
a
photograph
of
a
girl
it
was
an
excellent
likeness
to
priscilla
as
she
was
in
days
how
young
and
fresh
the
creature
looked
so
simple
so
inexperienced
it
startled
toby
do
remember
that
he
said
and
he
jerked
his
elbow
towards
the
photograph
that
that
my
daughter
said
priscilla
us
said
toby
in
turn
married
job
tansley
priscilla
continued
died
four
years
ago
last
knype
wakes
monday
her
married
indicating
the
photograph
married
young
gibson
last
september
well
murmured
toby
another
pause
there
was
a
shuffling
on
the
pavement
outside
and
some
children
began
to
sing
about
shepherds
and
flocks
bother
them
childer
said
priscilla
must
send
off
she
got
up
give
a
penny
toby
suggested
holding
out
a
penny
and
then
they
tell
others
and
i
sha
have
a
moment
peace
all
night
priscilla
grumbled
however
she
bestowed
the
penny
cutting
the
song
off
abruptly
in
the
middle
and
she
bolted
and
chained
the
door
and
sat
down
again
another
pause
well
said
priscilla
toby
agreed
coal
that
shilling
a
ton
another
pause
and
a
longer
ned
walklate
still
at
th
rose
and
crown
toby
asked
aught
i
know
he
is
said
priscilla
just
step
round
there
said
toby
picking
up
his
hat
and
rising
as
he
was
manoeuvring
the
priscilla
said
forgetting
your
umbrella
tobias
he
answered
hanna
forgotten
it
i
coming
back
their
eyes
met
charged
with
meaning
be
all
right
she
said
well
and
he
stepped
round
to
ned
walklate
from
one
generation
to
another
i
it
is
the
greatest
mistake
in
the
world
to
imagine
that
because
the
five
towns
is
an
industrial
district
devoted
to
the
manufacture
of
cups
and
saucers
marbles
and
therefore
there
is
no
luxury
in
it
a
writer
not
yet
deceased
who
spent
two
nights
there
and
wrote
four
hundred
pages
about
it
has
committed
herself
to
the
assertion
that
there
are
no
private
carriages
in
its
streets
only
perambulators
and
tramcars
that
writer
reputation
is
ruined
in
the
five
towns
for
the
five
towns
although
continually
complaining
of
bad
times
is
immensely
wealthy
as
well
as
immensely
poor
a
country
of
contrasts
indeed
and
private
carriages
if
they
do
not
abound
exist
at
any
rate
in
sufficient
numbers
nay
more
automobiles
of
the
most
expensive
french
and
english
makes
fly
dashingly
along
its
hilly
roads
and
scatter
in
profusion
the
rich
black
mud
thereof
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
last
spring
such
an
automobile
stood
outside
the
garden
entrance
of
bleakridge
house
just
halfway
between
hanbridge
and
bursley
it
belonged
to
young
harold
etches
of
etches
limited
the
great
porcelain
manufacturers
it
was
a
panhard
and
was
worth
over
a
thousand
pounds
as
it
stood
there
throbbing
and
harold
was
proud
of
it
he
was
also
proud
of
his
young
wife
maud
who
clad
in
several
hundred
pounds
worth
of
furs
had
taken
her
seat
next
to
the
and
was
waiting
for
harold
to
mount
by
her
side
the
united
ages
of
this
handsome
and
gay
couple
came
to
less
than
and
they
owned
the
and
bleakridge
house
with
its
ten
bedrooms
and
another
house
at
llandudno
and
a
controlling
interest
in
etches
limited
that
brought
them
in
seven
or
eight
thousand
a
year
they
were
a
pretty
tidy
example
of
what
the
five
towns
can
do
when
it
tries
to
be
wealthy
at
that
moment
when
harold
was
climbing
into
the
car
a
shabby
old
man
who
was
walking
down
the
road
followed
by
a
boy
carrying
a
stopped
suddenly
and
touched
harold
on
the
shoulder
us
exclaimed
the
old
man
and
the
boy
and
the
halted
behind
him
uncle
dan
said
harold
dan
cried
maud
springing
up
with
an
enchanting
smile
it
ages
since
what
d
reckon
gotten
here
demanded
the
old
man
my
new
car
harold
explained
drive
it
lad
asked
the
old
man
should
think
i
could
said
harold
confidently
commented
the
old
man
and
then
he
shook
hands
and
thoroughly
scrutinized
maud
now
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
only
be
seen
and
appreciated
in
a
district
like
the
five
towns
where
families
spring
into
splendour
out
of
nothing
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
generations
and
as
often
as
not
sink
back
again
into
nothing
in
the
course
of
two
generations
more
the
etches
family
is
among
the
best
known
and
the
widest
spread
in
the
five
towns
it
originated
in
three
brothers
of
whom
daniel
was
the
youngest
daniel
never
married
the
other
two
did
daniel
was
not
very
fond
of
money
the
other
two
were
and
they
founded
the
glorious
firm
of
etches
harold
was
the
grandson
of
one
brother
and
maud
was
the
granddaughter
of
the
other
consequently
they
both
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
dan
who
was
their
addressed
as
uncle
short
there
is
a
good
deal
of
snobbery
in
the
five
towns
but
it
does
not
exist
between
relatives
the
relatives
in
danger
of
suffering
by
it
would
never
stand
it
besides
although
dan
income
did
not
exceed
two
hundred
a
year
he
was
really
richer
than
his
grandnephew
since
dan
lived
on
half
his
income
whereas
harold
aided
by
maud
lived
on
all
of
his
consequently
despite
the
vast
difference
in
their
stations
clothes
and
manners
daniel
and
his
young
relatives
met
as
equals
it
would
have
been
amusing
to
see
anyone
even
the
countess
of
chell
who
patronized
the
entire
district
attempt
to
patronize
dan
in
his
time
he
had
been
the
greatest
in
the
country

miles
off

declining
years

asked
harold
going

course
said
harold
lad
said

yes
uncle
maud
insisted
lass
said
dan
you
will
uncle
said
maud
positively
you
do
never
speak
to

again
she
had
a
charming
fire
in
her
eyes
had
maud
daniel
the
old
bachelor
yielded
at
once
but
in
his
own
style
try
it
for
a
night
lass
said
he
thus
it
occurred
that
the
was
carried
into
bleakridge
house
and
that
after
some
delay
harold
and
maud
carried
off
uncle
dan
with
them
in
the
car
he
sat
in
the
luxurious
tonneau
behind
and
maud
had
quitted
her
husband
in
order
to
join
him
possibly
she
liked
the
humorous
wrinkles
round
his
grey
eyes
or
it
may
have
been
the
eyes
themselves
and
yet
dan
was
nearer
seventy
than
sixty
the
car
passed
everything
on
the
road
it
seemed
to
be
overtaking
electric
trams
all
the
time
been
married
a
year
said
uncle
dan
smiling
at
maud
yes
a
year
and
three
days
we
quite
used
to
it
be
in
in
a
minute
wench
exclaimed
dan
calmly
changing
the
topic
as
harold
swung
the
car
within
an
inch
of
a
brewer
dray
and
skidded
slightly
in
the
process
no
device
would
operate
in
that
generous
oozy
mud
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
in
hanbridge
the
next
minute
hanbridge
the
centre
of
the
religions
the
pleasures
and
the
vices
of
the
five
towns
us
said
the
old
man
fifteen
year
and
more
since
i
were
here
said
maud
stop
at
the
piccadilly
cafe
and
have
some
tea
asked
dan
be
that
a
kind
of
a
pub
harold
threw
the
explanation
over
his
shoulder
as
he
brought
the
car
up
with
swift
dexterity
in
front
of
the
misses
callear
newly
opened
afternoon
well
if
it
a
pub
said
uncle
dan
dunna
object
he
frankly
admitted
on
entering
that
he
had
never
before
seen
a
pub
full
of
little
tables
and
white
cloths
and
flowers
and
young
women
and
silver
teapots
and
and
though
he
did
pour
his
tea
into
his
saucer
he
was
sufficiently
at
home
there
to
address
the
younger
miss
callear
as
woman
and
to
inform
her
that
her
beverage
was
lacking
in
orange
pekoe
and
the
misses
callear
who
conferred
a
favour
on
their
customers
in
serving
them
did
like
it
he
became
reminiscent
he
said
i
left
th
five
towns
years
sin
to
go
weaving
i
derbyshire
wi
my
mother
brother
tay
were
ten
shilling
a
pun
us

it
when
us
were
sick
which
wasna
often
we
worked
too
hard
for
be
sick
hafe
past
five
i
th
morning
till
eight
of
a
night
and
then
saturday
afternoon
walk
ten
mile
to
glossop
with
a
week
work
on
ye
back
and
home
again
wi
th
brass
lost
th
habit
of
work
seemingly
he
went
on
as
the
car
moved
off
once
more
but
slowly
because
of
the
vast
crowds
emerging
from
the
knype
football
ground
football
saturday
bands
of
a
sunday
football
monday
ill
i

and
getting

with
any
comfort
i
these
cars
he
added
when
harold
had
got
clear
of
the
crowds
and
was
letting
out
he
regretfully
put
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
harold
skirted
the
whole
length
of
the
five
towns
from
south
to
north
at
an
average
rate
of
perhaps
thirty
miles
an
hour
and
quite
soon
the
party
found
itself
on
the
outer
side
of
turnhill
and
descending
the
terrible
clough
bank
three
miles
long
and
of
a
steepness
resembling
the
steepness
of
the
side
of
a
house
the
car
had
warmed
to
its
business
and
harold
took
them
down
that
declivity
in
a
manner
which
startled
even
maud
who
long
ago
had
resigned
herself
to
the
fact
that
she
was
tied
for
life
to
a
young
man
for
whom
the
word
had
no
meaning
at
the
bottom
they
had
a
swerve
skid
but
as
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
eccentricities
nothing
happened
except
that
the
car
tried
to
climb
the
hill
again
if
i
known
observed
uncle
dan
i
guessed
as
you
were
reservin
this
treat
for
th
owd
uncle
i
ha
walked
the
etches
blood
in
him
was
pretty
cool
but
his
nerve
had
had
a
shaking
then
harold
could
not
restart
the
car
the
engine
had
stopped
of
its
own
accord
and
though
harold
lavished
much
physical
force
on
the
magic
handle
in
front
nothing
would
budge
maud
and
the
old
man
got
down
the
latter
with
relief
eh
said
dan
steam
it
harold
cried
slapping
his
leg
an
ass
i
am
she

all
maud
pass
a
couple
of
cans
they
under
the

however
there

no
petrol
on
the
car
that
cursed
durand
durand

the
new
chauffeur

the
car

to

thing
i
said

the
fool

chap

back
to

and

money

harold
complained
the
old
man
agreed
after
a
few
words
on
pigeons
and
a
glass
of
beer
dan
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
borrowing
his
friend
white
mare
and
black
trap
he
himself
helped
in
the
harnessing
just
as
he
was
driving
triumphantly
away
with
that
delicious
vision
maud
on
his
left
hand
and
a
behind
he
reined
the
mare
in
us
a
couple
o
penny
smokes
matey
he
said
to
the
landlord
and
lit
one
the
mare
could
go
and
dan
could
make
her
go
and
she
did
go
and
the
whole
looked
extremely
dashing
when
ultimately
it
dashed
into
the
glare
of
the
acetylene
lamps
which
the
deserted
harold
had
lighted
on
his
car
the
red
end
of
a
penny
smoke
in
the
gloom
of
twilight
looks
exactly
as
well
as
the
red
end
of
an
havana
moreover
the
mare
caracolled
ornamentally
in
the
rays
of
the
acetylene
and
the
had
to
skip
down
quick
and
hold
her
head
much
didst
say
this
had
cost
thee
dan
asked
while
harold
was
pouring
the
indispensable
fluid
into
the
tank
far
off
twelve
hundred
answered
harold
lightly
that
cigar
away
from
here
pun
ud
buy
this
mare
dan
announced
to
the
road
all
aboard
harold
commanded
at
length
much
shall
i
give
to
the
boy
for
the
horse
and
trap
uncle
said
dan
havena
finished
wi
that
mare

think
i
was
going
to
trust

i
that
thing
o
yours

meet
thee
at
bleakridge
lad
i
think
i
go
with
uncle
too
harold
said
maud
whereupon
they
both
got
into
the
trap
harold
stared
at
them
astounded
i
say
he
protested
beginning
to
be
angry
uncle
dan
drove
away
like
the
wind
and
the
had
all
he
could
do
to
clamber
up
behind
ii
now
at
that
night
in
the
of
the
commodious
and
mansion
of
the
youngest
and
richest
of
the
etches
uncle
dan
stood
waiting
and
waiting
for
his
host
and
hostess
to
appear
he
was
wearing
a
turkish
tasselled
to
cover
his
baldness
and
he
had
taken
off
his
jacket
and
put
on
his
light
loose
overcoat
instead
of
it
since
that
was
a
comfortable
habit
of
his
he
sent
one
of
the
two
parlourmaids
upstairs
for
his
carpet
slippers
out
of
the
and
he
passed
part
of
the
time
in
changing
his
boots
for
his
slippers
in
front
of
the
fire
then
at
length
just
as
a
maid
was
staggering
out
under
the
load
of
those
enormous
boots
harold
appeared
very
correct
but
alone
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
uncle
said
harold
maud
is
well
she
is
coming
down
tonight
up
wi
maud
goodness
knows
responded
harold
gloomily
not
well
that
all
said
dan
let
peck
a
bit
so
they
sat
down
and
began
to
peck
a
bit
aided
by
the
two
maids
dan
pecked
with
prodigious
enthusiasm
but
harold
was
not
in
good
pecking
form
and
as
the
dinner
progressed
and
harold
sent
dish
after
dish
up
to
his
wife
and
his
wife
returned
dish
after
dish
untouched
gloom
communicated
itself
to
the
house
in
general
one
felt
that
if
one
had
penetrated
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
farthest
attic
a
little
parcel
of
spiritual
gloom
would
have
already
arrived
there
the
sense
of
disaster
was
in
the
abode
the
cook
was
prophesying
like
anything
in
the
kitchen
durand
in
the
garage
was
meditating
upon
such
of
his
master
pithy
remarks
as
he
had
been
able
to
understand
when
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
cigars
had
been
served
and
the
two
maids
had
left
the
dan
turned
to
his
grandnephew
and
said
things
as
has
changed
since
my
time

and
it
isna

into
a
kitchen
full
of
servants

missis

on

the
crowd
and
presently
he

and
she

an
apple
and

the
arm
of
a
chair

i
do
not
feeling
very
well
whispered
uncle
dan
weakly
have
these
attacks
sometimes
there
only
one
thing
as
do
me
any
good
brandy
and
his
head
fell
over
one
side
of
the
chair
and
he
looked
precisely
like
a
corpse
what
are
you
doing
almost
shouted
harold
when
he
came
into
the
room
she
was
putting
a
to
uncle
dan
lips
harold
she
cried
had
an
attack
of
some
sort
giving
him
some
brandy
you
must
give
him
brandy
said
harold
authoritatively
to
her
i
must
give
him
brandy
said
maud
told
me
that
brandy
was
the
only
thing
to
save
him
child
harold
persisted
told
me
all
about
these
attacks
they
perfectly
harmless
so
long
as
he
does
have
brandy
the
doctors
have
warned
him
that
brandy
will
be
fatal
you
are
absolutely
mistaken
do
you
understand
that
uncle
has
only
this
minute
told
me
that
he
must
have
brandy
and
she
again
approached
the
glass
to
the
pale
lips
of
the
old
man
his
tasselled
turkish
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
the
hemisphere
of
his
bald
head
glittered
under
the
gas
i
forbid
you
and
harold
put
a
hand
on
the
glass
a
matter
of
life
and
death
you
must
have
misunderstood
uncle
was
you
who
misunderstood
uncle
said
maud
course
if
you
mean
to
prevent
me
by
brute
force
they
both
paused
and
glanced
at
daniel
and
then
at
each
other
you
are
right
dearest
said
harold
in
a
new
tone
dearest
said
maud
also
in
a
new
tone
expect
you
are
right
i
must
have
misunderstood
no
maud
give
him
the
brandy
by
all
means
i
no
doubt
right
if
you
think
i
better
not
give
it
him
i
would
prefer
you
to
give
it
him
dearest
it
is
likely
you
would
be
mistaken
in
a
thing
like
that
would
prefer
to
be
guided
by
you
dearest
said
maud
so
they
went
on
for
several
minutes
each
giving
way
to
the
other
in
the
most
angelic
manner
meantime
i
supposed
to
be
dying
am
i
roared
uncle
dan
suddenly
sitting
up
let
th
old
uncle
peg
out
while
you
practise
his
precepts
a
nice
pair
you
make
i
thought
for
see
which
on
ye
ud
give
way
to
th
other
but
i
didna
anticipate
as
both
on
ye
be
ready
to
sacrifice
my
life
for
th
sake
o
domestic
peace
uncle
they
both
said
later
amid
the
universal
and
yet
rather
shamefaced
peace
rejoicings
said
nothing
was
worth
a
quarrel
i
was
right
answered
dan
was
right
th
divorce
court
is
full
o
fools
as
have
begun
married
life
by
trying
to
convince
the
other
fool
instead
o
humouring
him
or
her
kiss
us
maud
the
death
of
simon
fuge
i
it
was
in
the
train
that
i
learnt
of
his
death
although
a
very
greedy
eater
of
literature
i
can
only
enjoy
reading
when
i
have
little
time
for
reading
give
me
three
hours
of
absolute
leisure
with
nothing
to
do
but
read
and
i
instantly
become
almost
incapable
of
the
act
so
it
is
always
on
railway
journeys
and
so
it
was
that
evening
i
was
in
the
middle
of
wordsworth
excursion
i
positively
gloated
over
it
wondering
why
i
should
have
allowed
a
mere
rumour
that
it
was
dull
to
prevent
me
from
consuming
it
earlier
in
my
life
but
do
you
suppose
i
could
continue
with
wordsworth
in
the
train
i
could
not
i
stared
out
of
the
windows
i
calculated
the
speed
of
the
train
by
my
watch
i
thought
of
my
future
and
my
past
i
drew
forth
my
hopes
examined
them
polished
them
and
put
them
back
again
i
forgave
myself
for
my
sins
and
i
dreamed
of
the
exciting
conquest
of
a
beautiful
and
brilliant
woman
that
i
should
one
day
achieve
in
short
i
did
everything
that
men
habitually
do
under
such
circumstances
the
gazette
was
lying
folded
on
the
seat
beside
me
one
of
the
two
london
evening
papers
that
a
man
of
taste
may
peruse
without
humiliating
himself
how
appetizing
a
morsel
this
sheet
new
and
smooth
from
the
press
this
sheet
written
by
an
ironic
understanding
small
band
of
men
for
just
a
few
thousand
persons
like
me
ruthlessly
scornful
of
the
big
circulations
and
the
idols
of
the
people
if
the
gazette
and
its
sole
rival
ceased
to
appear
i
do
believe
that
my
existence
and
many
similar
existences
would
wear
a
different
colour
could
one
dine
alone
in
jermyn
street
or
panton
street
without
this
fine
piquant
evening
commentary
on
the
gross
newspapers
of
the
morning
now
you
perceive
what
sort
of
a
man
i
am
and
you
guess
rightly
that
my
age
is
between
thirty
and
forty
but
the
train
had
stopped
at
rugby
and
started
again
and
more
than
half
of
my
journey
was
accomplished
ere
at
length
i
picked
up
the
gazette
and
opened
it
with
the
false
calm
of
a
drunkard
who
has
sworn
that
he
will
not
wet
his
lips
before
a
certain
hour
for
well
knowing
from
experience
that
i
should
suffer
acute
ennui
in
the
train
i
had
when
buying
the
gazette
at
euston
taken
oath
that
i
would
not
even
glance
at
it
till
after
rugby
it
is
always
the
final
hour
of
these
railway
journeys
that
is
the
nethermost
hell
the
second
thing
that
i
saw
in
the
gazette
the
first
was
of
course
the
column
of
wit
humour
and
parody
very
uneven
in
its
excellence
was
the
death
of
simon
fuge
there
was
nearly
a
column
about
it
signed
with
initials
and
the
subheading
of
the
article
ran
death
of
a
great
painter
that
was
characteristic
of
the
gazette
that
simon
fuge
was
indeed
a
great
painter
is
now
admitted
by
most
dilettantes
though
denied
by
a
few
but
to
the
great
public
he
was
not
one
of
the
few
great
names
to
the
great
public
he
was
just
a
medium
name
ten
to
one
that
in
speaking
of
him
to
a
plain
person
you
would
feel
compelled
to
add
painter
you
know
and
the
plain
person
would
respond
yes
falsely
pretending
that
he
was
perfectly
familiar
with
the
name
simon
fuge
had
many
friends
on
the
press
and
it
was
solely
owing
to
the
loyalty
of
these
friends
in
the
matter
of
obituary
notices
that
the
great
public
heard
more
of
simon
fuge
in
the
week
after
his
death
than
it
had
heard
of
him
during
the
years
of
his
life
it
may
be
asked
why
if
he
had
so
many
and
such
loyal
friends
on
the
press
these
friends
did
not
take
measures
to
establish
his
reputation
before
he
died
the
answer
is
that
editors
will
not
allow
journalists
to
praise
a
living
artist
much
in
excess
of
the
esteem
in
which
the
public
holds
him
they
are
timid
but
when
a
misunderstood
artist
is
dead
the
editors
will
put
no
limit
on
laudation
i
am
not
on
the
press
but
it
happens
that
i
know
the
world
of
all
the
obituary
notices
of
simon
fuge
the
gazette
was
the
first
somehow
the
gazette
had
obtained
exclusive
news
of
the
little
event
and
some
one
high
up
on
the
gazette
staff
had
a
very
exalted
notion
indeed
of
fuge
and
must
have
known
him
personally
fuge
received
his
deserts
as
a
painter
in
that
column
of
print
he
was
compared
to
sorolla
y
bastida
for
vitality
the
morbidezza
of
his
was
stated
to
be
unrivalled
even
by
i
forget
the
name
painting
is
not
my
speciality
the
writer
blandly
inquired
why
examples
of
fuge
work
were
to
be
seen
in
the
luxembourg
at
vienna
at
florence
at
dresden
and
not
for
instance
at
the
tate
gallery
or
in
the
chantrey
collection
the
writer
also
inquired
with
equal
blandness
why
a
painter
who
had
been
on
the
hanging
committee
of
the
societe
nationale
des
beaux
arts
at
paris
should
not
have
been
found
worthy
to
be
even
an
in
london
in
brief
old
england
it
as
occurred
somewhere
or
other
most
nights
in
the
columns
of
the
gazette
fuge
also
received
his
deserts
as
a
man
and
the
gazette
did
not
conceal
that
he
had
not
been
a
man
after
the
heart
of
the
british
public
he
had
been
too
romantically
and
intensely
alive
for
that
the
writer
gave
a
little
penportrait
of
him
it
was
very
good
recalling
his
tricks
of
manner
his
unforgettable
eyes
and
his
amazing
skill
in
talking
about
himself
and
really
interesting
everybody
in
himself
there
was
a
special
reference
to
one
of
fuge
most
dramatic
recitals
a
narration
of
a
night
spent
in
a
boat
on
ham
lake
with
two
beautiful
girls
sisters
natives
of
the
five
towns
where
fuge
was
born
said
the
obituarist
two
wonderful
creatures
who
played
so
large
a
part
in
simon
fuge
life
this
death
was
a
shock
to
me
it
took
away
my
ennui
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
i
too
had
known
simon
fuge
that
is
to
say
i
had
met
him
once
at
a
soiree
and
on
that
single
occasion
as
luck
had
it
he
had
favoured
the
company
with
the
very
narration
to
which
the
gazette
contributor
referred
i
remembered
well
the
burning
brilliance
of
his
eyes
his
touching
assurance
that
all
of
us
were
necessarily
interested
in
his
adventures
and
the
extremely
graphic
and
convincing
way
in
which
he
reconstituted
for
us
the
nocturnal
scene
on
ham
lake
the
two
sisters
the
boat
the
rustle
of
trees
the
lights
on
shore
and
his
own
difficulty
in
managing
the
oars
one
of
which
he
lost
for
and
found
again
it
was
by
such
details
as
that
about
the
oar
that
with
a
tint
of
humour
he
added
realism
to
the
romantic
quality
of
his
tales
he
seemed
to
have
no
reticences
concerning
himself
decidedly
he
allowed
things
to
be
understood
yes
his
was
a
romantic
figure
the
figure
of
one
to
whom
every
day
and
every
hour
of
the
day
was
coloured
by
the
violence
of
his
passion
for
existence
his
pictures
had
often
an
unearthly
beauty
but
for
him
they
were
nothing
but
faithful
renderings
of
what
he
saw
my
mind
dwelt
on
those
two
beautiful
sisters
those
two
beautiful
sisters
appealed
to
me
more
than
anything
else
in
the
obituary
surely
simon
fuge
had
obviously
been
a
man
whose
emotional
susceptibility
and
virile
impulsiveness
must
have
opened
the
door
for
him
to
multifarious
amours
but
surely
he
had
not
made
himself
indispensable
to
both
sisters
simultaneously
surely
even
he
had
not
so
far
forgotten
that
ham
lake
was
in
the
middle
of
a
country
called
england
and
not
the
ornamental
water
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
yet
the
delicious
possibility
of
ineffable
indiscretions
on
the
part
of
simon
fuge
monopolized
my
mind
till
the
train
stopped
at
knype
and
i
descended
nevertheless
i
think
i
am
a
serious
and
fairly
insular
englishman
it
is
truly
astonishing
how
a
serious
person
can
be
obsessed
by
trifles
that
to
speak
mildly
do
not
merit
sustained
attention
i
wondered
where
ham
lake
was
i
knew
merely
that
it
lay
somewhere
in
the
environs
of
the
five
towns
what
put
fuel
on
the
fire
of
my
interest
in
the
private
affairs
of
the
dead
painter
was
the
slightly
curious
coincidence
that
on
the
evening
of
the
news
of
his
death
i
should
be
travelling
to
the
five
towns
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
here
i
was
at
knype
which
as
i
had
gathered
from
bradshaw
and
from
my
acquaintance
brindley
was
the
traffic
centre
of
the
five
towns
ii
my
knowledge
of
industrial
districts
amounted
to
nothing
born
in
devonshire
educated
at
cambridge
and
fulfilling
my
destiny
as
curator
of
a
certain
department
of
antiquities
at
the
british
museum
i
had
never
been
brought
into
contact
with
the
vast
constructive
material
activities
of
lancashire
yorkshire
and
staffordshire
i
had
but
passed
through
them
occasionally
on
my
way
to
scotland
scorning
their
necessary
grime
with
the
perhaps
too
facile
disdain
of
the
southerner
who
is
apt
to
forget
that
coal
can
not
walk
up
unaided
out
of
the
mine
and
that
the
basin
in
which
he
washes
his
beautiful
purity
can
only
be
manufactured
amid
conditions
highly
repellent
well
my
impressions
of
the
platform
of
knype
station
were
unfavourable
there
was
dirt
in
the
air
i
could
feel
it
at
once
on
my
skin
and
the
scene
was
shabby
undignified
and
rude
i
use
the
word
in
all
its
senses
what
i
saw
was
a
pushing
exclamatory
determined
crowd
each
member
of
which
was
bent
on
the
realization
of
his
own
desires
by
the
least
ceremonious
means
if
an
item
of
this
throng
wished
to
get
past
me
he
made
me
instantly
aware
of
his
wish
by
abruptly
changing
my
position
in
infinite
space
it
was
not
possible
to
misconstrue
his
meaning
so
much
crude
force
and
naked
i
had
not
before
set
eyes
on
in
truth
i
felt
myself
to
be
a
very
brittle
delicate
bit
of
intellectual
machinery
in
the
midst
of
all
these
physical
manifestations
yet
i
am
a
tallish
man
and
these
potters
appeared
to
me
to
be
undersized
and
somewhat
thin
too
but
what
elbows
what
glaring
egoistic
eyes
what
terrible
decisiveness
in
action
then
get
in
if
ye
going
said
a
porter
to
me
curtly
not
going
i
just
got
out
i
replied
then
why
dunna
ye
stand
out
o
th
wee
and
let
them
get
in
as
wants
to
unable
to
offer
a
coherent
answer
to
this
crushing
demand
i
stood
out
of
the
way
in
the
light
of
further
knowledge
i
now
surmise
that
that
porter
was
a
very
friendly
and
sociable
porter
but
at
the
moment
i
really
believed
that
taking
me
for
the
least
admirable
and
necessary
of
god
creatures
he
meant
to
convey
his
opinion
to
me
for
my
own
good
i
glanced
up
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
train
and
saw
the
composed
careless
faces
of
haughty
persons
who
were
going
direct
from
london
to
manchester
and
to
whom
the
five
towns
was
nothing
but
a
delay
i
envied
them
i
wanted
to
return
to
the
shelter
of
the
train
when
it
left
i
fancied
that
my
last
link
with
civilization
was
broken
then
another
train
puffed
in
and
it
was
simply
taken
by
assault
in
a
fraction
of
time
to
an
incomprehensible
bawling
of
friendly
sociable
porters
holders
at
finsbury
park
think
they
know
how
to
possess
themselves
of
a
train
they
are
deceived
so
this
is
where
simon
fuge
came
from
i
reflected
the
devil
it
is
i
reflected
i
tried
to
conceive
what
the
invaders
of
the
train
would
exclaim
if
confronted
by
one
of
simon
fuge
pictures
i
could
imagine
only
one
word
and
that
a
monosyllable
that
would
meet
the
case
of
their
sentiments
and
his
dalliance
his
tangential
nocturnal
deviations
in
gondolas
with
exquisite
twin
odalisques
there
did
not
seem
to
be
much
room
for
amorous
elegance
in
the
lives
of
these
invaders
and
his
death
what
would
they
say
of
his
death
upon
my
soul
as
i
stood
on
that
dirty
platform
in
a
milieu
of
advertisements
of
soap
boots
and
aperients
i
began
to
believe
that
simon
fuge
never
had
lived
that
he
was
a
mere
illusion
of
his
friends
and
his
small
public
all
that
i
saw
around
me
was
a
violent
negation
of
simon
fuge
that
entity
of
rare
fine
exotic
sensibilities
that
perfectly
mad
gourmet
of
sensations
that
exotic
seer
of
beauty
i
caught
sight
of
my
acquaintance
and
host
mr
robert
brindley
coming
towards
me
on
the
platform
hitherto
i
had
only
met
him
in
london
when
as
chairman
of
the
committee
of
management
of
the
wedgwood
institution
and
school
of
art
at
bursley
he
had
called
on
me
at
the
british
museum
for
advice
as
to
loan
exhibits
he
was
then
dressed
like
a
tourist
now
although
an
architect
by
profession
he
appeared
to
be
anxious
to
be
mistaken
for
a
sporting
squire
he
wore
very
baggy
knickerbockers
and
leggings
and
a
cap
this
raiment
was
apparently
the
agreed
uniform
of
the
easy
classes
in
the
five
towns
for
in
the
crowd
i
had
noticed
several
such
consciously
superior
figures
among
the
artisans
mr
brindley
like
most
of
the
people
in
the
station
had
a
slightly
pinched
and
chilled
air
as
though
that
morning
he
had
by
inadvertence
omitted
to
don
those
garments
which
are
not
seen
he
also
like
most
of
the
people
there
but
not
to
the
same
extent
had
a
somewhat
suspicious
and
narrowly
shrewd
regard
as
who
should
say
any
person
thinks
he
can
get
the
better
of
me
by
a
trick
let
him
try
that
all
but
the
moment
his
eye
encountered
mine
this
expression
vanished
from
his
face
and
he
gave
me
a
candid
smile
hope
you
well
he
said
gravely
squeezing
my
hand
in
a
sort
of
vice
that
he
carried
at
the
end
of
his
right
arm
i
reassured
him
i
all
right
he
said
in
response
to
the
expression
of
my
hopes
it
was
a
relief
to
me
to
see
him
he
took
charge
of
me
i
felt
as
it
were
safe
in
his
arms
i
perceived
that
unaided
and
unprotected
i
should
never
have
succeeded
in
reaching
bursley
from
knype
a
whistle
sounded
get
in
he
suggested
and
then
in
a
tone
of
absolute
command
me
your
bag
i
obeyed
he
opened
the
door
of
a
carriage
travelling
second
i
explained
mind
get
in
in
his
tones
was
a
kindly
exasperation
i
got
in
he
followed
the
train
moved
breathed
mr
brindley
blowing
out
much
air
and
falling
like
a
sack
of
coal
into
a
corner
seat
he
was
a
thin
man
aged
about
thirty
with
brown
eyes
and
a
short
blonde
beard
conversation
was
at
first
difficult
personally
i
am
not
a
bubbling
fount
of
gay
nothings
when
i
find
myself
alone
with
a
comparative
stranger
my
drawbridge
goes
up
as
if
by
magic
my
postern
is
closed
and
i
peer
cautiously
through
the
narrow
slits
of
my
turret
to
estimate
the
chances
of
peril
nor
was
mr
brindley
offensively
affable
however
we
struggled
into
a
kind
of
chatter
i
had
come
to
the
five
towns
on
behalf
of
the
british
museum
to
inspect
and
appraise
with
a
view
to
purchase
by
the
nation
some
huge
dishes
excessively
curious
according
to
photographs
which
had
been
discovered
in
the
cellars
of
the
conservative
club
at
bursley
having
shared
in
the
negotiations
for
my
visit
mr
brindley
had
invited
me
to
spend
the
night
at
his
house
we
were
able
to
talk
about
all
this
and
when
we
had
talked
about
all
this
we
were
able
to
talk
about
the
singular
scenery
of
coal
dust
potsherds
flame
and
steam
through
which
the
train
wound
its
way
it
was
squalid
ugliness
but
it
was
squalid
ugliness
on
a
scale
so
vast
and
overpowering
that
it
became
sublime
great
furnaces
gleamed
red
in
the
twilight
and
their
fires
were
reflected
in
horrible
black
canals
processions
of
heavy
vapour
drifted
in
all
directions
across
the
sky
over
what
acres
of
mean
and
miserable
brown
architecture
the
air
was
alive
with
the
most
extraordinary
weird
gigantic
sounds
i
do
not
think
the
five
towns
will
ever
be
described
dante
lived
too
soon
as
for
the
erratic
and
exquisite
genius
simon
fuge
and
his
odalisques
reclining
on
silken
cushions
on
the
enchanted
bosom
of
a
lake
i
could
no
longer
conjure
them
up
even
faintly
in
my
mind
suppose
you
know
simon
fuge
is
dead
i
remarked
in
a
pause
is
he
said
mr
brindley
with
interest
it
in
the
paper
he
did
not
seem
to
be
quite
sure
that
it
would
be
in
the
paper
it
is
said
i
and
i
passed
him
the
gazette
he
exclaimed
explosively
this
was
entirely
different
from
his
something
shot
across
his
eyes
something
incredibly
rapid
too
rapid
for
a
wink
yet
it
could
only
be
called
a
wink
it
was
the
most
subtle
transmission
of
the
that
i
have
ever
known
any
man
accomplish
and
it
endeared
mr
brindley
to
me
but
i
knew
not
its
significance
do
they
think
of
fuge
down
here
i
asked
do
expect
they
think
of
him
said
my
host
he
pulled
a
pouch
and
a
packet
of
cigarette
papers
from
his
pocket
one
of
mine
i
suggested
hastily
producing
my
case
he
did
not
even
glance
at
its
contents
thanks
he
said
curtly
i
named
my
brand
dear
sir
he
said
with
a
return
to
his
kindly
exasperation
cigarette
that
is
not
fresh
made
can
be
called
a
cigarette
i
stood
corrected
may
pay
as
much
as
you
like
but
you
can
never
buy
cigarettes
as
good
as
i
can
make
out
of
an
ounce
of
fresh
tobacco
can
you
roll
one
i
had
to
admit
that
i
could
not
i
who
in
bloomsbury
was
accepted
as
an
authority
on
cigarettes
as
well
as
on
porcelain
roll
you
one
and
you
shall
try
it
he
did
so
i
gathered
from
his
solemnity
that
cigarettes
counted
in
the
life
of
mr
brindley
he
could
not
take
cigarettes
other
than
seriously
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
quite
right
the
cigarette
which
he
constructed
for
me
out
of
his
wretched
tobacco
was
adorable
and
i
have
made
my
own
cigarettes
ever
since
you
will
find
tobacco
all
over
the
haunts
frequented
by
us
of
the
museum
solely
owing
to
the
expertise
of
mr
brindley
a
terribly
capable
and
positive
man
he
knew
and
he
knew
that
he
knew
he
said
nothing
further
as
to
simon
fuge
apparently
he
had
forgotten
the
decease
you
often
see
the
gazette
i
asked
perhaps
in
the
hope
of
attracting
him
back
to
fuge
he
said
musical
criticism
is
too
rotten
involuntarily
i
bridled
it
was
startling
and
it
was
not
agreeable
to
have
one
favourite
organ
so
abruptly
condemned
by
a
provincial
architect
in
knickerbockers
and
a
cap
in
the
midst
of
all
that
industrial
ugliness
what
could
the
five
towns
know
about
art
yet
here
was
this
fellow
condemning
the
gazette
on
artistic
grounds
i
offered
no
defence
because
he
was
right
again
but
i
did
not
like
it
you
ever
see
the
manchester
guardian
he
questioned
carrying
the
war
into
my
camp
i
said
he
ejaculated
often
heard
that
it
a
very
good
paper
i
said
politely
is
a
very
good
paper
he
laid
me
low
the
best
paper
in
the
world
try
it
for
a
month
it
gets
to
euston
at
eight
and
then
tell
me
what
you
think
i
saw
that
i
must
pull
myself
together
i
had
glided
into
the
five
towns
in
a
mood
of
gentle
wise
condescension
i
saw
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
my
own
honour
and
safety
to
put
on
another
mood
as
quickly
as
possible
otherwise
i
might
be
left
for
dead
on
the
field
certainly
the
fellow
was
provincial
curt
even
brutal
in
his
despisal
of
diplomacy
certainly
he
exaggerated
the
importance
of
cigarettes
in
the
great
secular
scheme
of
evolution
but
he
was
a
man
he
was
a
very
tonic
dose
i
thought
it
would
be
safer
to
assume
that
he
knew
everything
and
that
the
british
museum
knew
very
little
yet
at
the
british
museum
he
had
been
quite
different
quite
deferential
and
rather
timid
still
i
liked
him
i
liked
his
eyes
the
train
stopped
at
an
incredible
station
situated
in
the
centre
of
a
rolling
desert
whose
surface
consisted
of
broken
pots
and
cinders
i
expect
no
one
to
believe
this
we
are
said
he
blithely
give
me
the
bag
porter
his
summons
to
the
solitary
porter
was
like
a
clap
of
thunder
iii
he
lived
in
a
low
house
at
the
corner
of
a
street
along
which
electric
cars
were
continually
thundering
there
was
a
thin
cream
of
mud
on
the
pavements
and
about
two
inches
of
mud
in
the
roadway
rich
nourishing
mud
like
indian
ink
the
prospect
of
carrying
a
pound
or
so
of
that
unique
mud
into
a
civilized
house
affrighted
me
but
mr
brindley
opened
his
door
with
his
latchkey
and
entered
the
abode
as
unconcernedly
as
if
some
fair
repentent
had
cleansed
his
feet
with
her
tresses
worry
too
much
about
the
dirt
he
said
in
bursley
the
house
seemed
much
larger
inside
than
out
a
burnt
in
the
hall
and
sombre
portieres
gave
large
mysterious
hints
of
rooms
i
could
hear
in
the
distance
the
noise
of
frizzling
over
a
fire
and
of
a
child
crying
then
a
tall
straight
wellmade
energetic
woman
appeared
like
a
conjuring
trick
from
behind
a
portiere
do
you
do
mr
loring
she
greeted
me
smiling
glad
to
meet
you
wife
mr
brindley
explained
gravely
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
bob
said
she
still
smiling
at
me
got
a
sore
throat
and
it
may
be
mumps
the
chimney
been
on
fire
and
we
going
to
be
summoned
and
you
owe
me
sixpence
do
i
owe
you
sixpence
annie
had
her
baby
and
it
a
girl
all
right
supper
ready
is
waiting
for
you
she
laughed
i
have
anything
to
tell
my
husband
i
always
tell
him
at
once
she
said
matter
who
there
she
pronounced
with
a
wholehearted
enthusiasm
for
its
vowel
sound
that
i
have
never
heard
equalled
elsewhere
and
also
with
a
very
magnified
at
the
beginning
of
it
often
when
i
hear
the
word
pronounced
in
less
downright
parts
of
the
world
i
remember
how
they
pronounce
it
in
the
five
towns
and
there
rises
up
before
me
a
complete
picture
of
the
district
its
atmosphere
its
spirit
mr
brindley
led
me
to
a
large
bathroom
that
had
a
faint
odour
of
warm
linen
in
addition
to
a
lot
of
assorted
white
babyclothes
there
were
millions
of
towels
in
that
bathroom
he
turned
on
a
tap
and
the
place
was
instantly
full
of
steam
from
a
jet
of
boiling
water
then
he
said
can
start
as
he
showed
no
intention
of
leaving
me
i
did
start
you
scald
yourself
he
warned
me
water
hot
while
i
was
washing
he
prepared
to
wash
i
suddenly
felt
as
if
i
had
been
intimate
with
him
and
his
wife
for
about
ten
years
this
is
bursley
i
murmured
taking
my
mouth
out
of
a
towel
we
call
it
he
said
you
know
the
limerick
there
was
a
young
woman
of
bosley
he
intoned
the
local
limerick
it
was
excellently
good
not
meet
for
a
mixed
company
but
a
genuine
delight
to
the
true
amateur
one
good
limerick
deserves
another
it
happened
that
i
knew
a
number
of
the
unprinted
rossetti
limericks
precious
things
not
at
all
easy
to
get
at
i
detailed
them
to
mr
brindley
and
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
say
that
i
impressed
him
i
recovered
all
the
ground
i
had
lost
upon
cigarettes
and
newspapers
he
appreciated
those
limericks
with
a
juster
taste
than
i
should
have
expected
so
afterwards
did
his
friends
my
belief
is
that
i
am
to
this
day
known
and
revered
in
bursley
not
as
loring
the
porcelain
expert
from
the
british
museum
but
as
the
man
who
first
as
it
were
brought
the
good
news
of
the
rossetti
limericks
from
ghent
to
aix
bob
an
amicable
voice
shrieked
femininely
up
from
the
i
to
send
the
soup
to
the
bathroom
or
are
you
coming
down
a
limerick
will
make
a
man
forget
even
his
dinner
mr
brindley
performed
once
more
with
his
eyes
that
something
that
was
not
a
wink
but
a
wink
unutterably
refined
and
spiritualized
this
time
i
comprehended
its
import
its
import
was
to
the
effect
that
women
are
women
we
descended
mr
brindley
still
in
his
knickerbockers
way
he
said
drawing
aside
a
portiere
mrs
brindley
as
we
entered
the
room
was
trotting
a
male
infant
round
and
round
a
table
charged
with
everything
digestible
and
indigestible
she
handed
the
child
who
was
in
its
nightdress
to
a
maid
good
night
to
father
ni
faver
the
interesting
creature
piped
sonny
said
the
father
stooping
to
tickle
suppose
he
added
when
maid
and
infant
had
gone
one
going
to
have
mumps
they
may
as
well
all
have
it
together
of
course
the
mother
agreed
cheerfully
shall
stick
them
all
into
a
room
many
children
have
you
i
inquired
with
polite
curiosity
she
said
the
eldest
that
you
seen
what
chiefly
struck
me
about
mrs
brindley
was
her
serene
air
of
capableness
of
having
a
which
experience
had
richly
justified
i
could
see
that
she
must
be
an
extremely
sensible
mother
and
yet
she
had
quite
another
aspect
too
how
shall
i
explain
it
as
though
she
had
only
had
children
in
her
spare
time
we
sat
down
the
room
was
lighted
by
four
candles
on
the
table
i
am
rather
and
so
i
did
not
immediately
notice
that
there
were
low
all
round
the
walls
why
the
presence
of
these
should
have
caused
me
a
certain
astonishment
i
do
not
know
but
it
did
i
thought
of
knype
station
and
the
scenery
and
then
the
other
little
station
and
the
desert
of
pots
and
cinders
and
the
mud
in
the
road
and
on
the
pavement
and
in
the
hall
and
the
in
the
bathroom
and
three
children
all
down
with
mumps
and
mr
cap
and
knickerbockers
and
cigarettes
and
somehow
the
books
i
soon
saw
there
were
at
least
a
thousand
of
them
and
not
books
either
but
books
well
they
administered
a
little
shock
to
me
to
mr
brindley
right
hand
was
a
bottle
of
bass
and
a
corkscrew
he
exclaimed
with
solemn
ecstasy
with
an
ecstasy
gross
and
luscious
and
drawing
the
cork
he
poured
out
a
glass
with
fine
skill
in
the
management
of
froth
and
pushed
it
towards
me
thanks
i
said
beer
he
murmured
with
benevolent
puzzled
disdain
thanks
i
said
know
what
mr
loring
would
like
said
mrs
brindley
jumping
up
know
what
mr
loring
would
like
she
opened
a
cupboard
and
came
back
to
the
table
with
a
bottle
which
she
planted
in
front
of
me
you
mr
loring
it
was
a
bottle
of
mercurey
a
wine
which
has
given
me
many
dreadful
dawns
but
which
i
have
never
known
how
to
refuse
should
i
admitted
it
very
bad
for
me
said
she
she
looked
at
her
husband
in
triumph
repeated
mr
brindley
with
undiminished
ecstasy
and
drank
about
of
a
glass
at
one
try
then
he
wiped
the
froth
from
his
moustache
he
breathed
low
and
soft
they
called
the
meal
supper
the
term
is
inadequate
no
term
that
i
can
think
of
would
be
adequate
of
its
kind
the
thing
was
perfect
mrs
brindley
knew
that
it
was
perfect
mr
brindley
also
knew
that
it
was
perfect
there
were
prawns
in
aspic
i
do
know
why
i
should
single
out
that
dish
except
that
it
seemed
strange
to
me
to
have
crossed
the
desert
of
pots
and
cinders
in
order
to
encounter
prawns
in
aspic
mr
brindley
ate
more
cold
roast
beef
than
i
had
ever
seen
any
man
eat
before
and
more
pickled
walnuts
it
is
true
that
the
cold
roast
beef
transcended
all
the
cold
roast
beef
of
my
experience
mrs
brindley
regaled
herself
largely
on
trifle
which
mr
brindley
would
not
approach
preferring
a
most
glorious
stilton
cheese
i
lost
touch
temporarily
with
the
intellectual
life
it
was
mr
brindley
who
recalled
me
to
it
he
said
this
was
at
the
beef
and
pickles
stage
no
answer
mrs
brindley
turned
to
me
name
is
not
jane
she
said
laughing
and
making
a
moue
simultaneously
only
calls
me
that
to
annoy
me
i
told
him
i
would
answer
to
it
and
i
wo
he
thinks
i
shall
give
in
because
we
got
company
but
i
wo
treat
you
as
company
mr
loring
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
take
my
side
what
dreadful
weather
we
having
are
we
i
joined
in
the
game

a
comfortable
journey
down
thank
you
then
mary
mr
brindley
yielded
you
very
much
mr
loring
for
your
kind
assistance
said
his
wife
dearest
mr
brindley
glanced
at
me
over
his
second
glass
of
beer
those
confounded
kids
are
going
to
have
mumps
he
addressed
his
words
apparently
into
the
interior
of
the
glass
probably
means
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
means
money
and
i
sha
be
able
to
afford
the
hortulus
animoe
i
opened
my
ears
husband
goes
stark
staring
mad
sometimes
said
mrs
brindley
to
me
lasts
for
a
week
or
so
and
pretty
nearly
lands
us
in
the
workhouse
this
time
it
the
hortulus
animoe
do
you
know
what
it
is
i
do
i
said
and
the
prestige
of
the
british
museum
trembled
then
i
had
a
vague
recollection
an
illuminated
manuscript
of
that
name
in
the
imperial
library
of
vienna
is
there
got
it
in
one
said
mr
brindley
pass
those
walnuts
are
by
any
chance
buying
it
i
laughed
he
said
johnny
at
utrecht
is
issuing
a
facsimile
of
it
with
all
the
hundred
odd
miniatures
in
colour
it
will
be
the
finest
thing
in
reproduction
ever
done
only
copies
for
england
much
i
asked
said
he
with
a
preliminary
look
at
his
wife
pounds
pounds
she
screamed
never
told
me
wife
never
will
understand
said
mr
brindley
complete
confidence
between
two
human
beings
is
impossible
shall
go
out
as
a
milliner
that
all
mrs
brindley
returned
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
is
paid
for
yet
glad
i
forgot
that
otherwise
i
should
have
ordered
the
hortulus
not
ordered
it
i
have
it
be
here
tomorrow
at
least
the
first
part
will
mrs
brindley
affected
to
fall
back
dying
in
her
chair
mad
she
complained
to
me
mad
it
a
hopeless
case
but
obviously
she
was
very
proud
of
the
incurable
lunatic
you
a
i
exclaimed
so
struck
by
these
feats
of
extravagance
in
a
modest
house
that
i
did
not
conceal
my
amazement
you
think
i
collected
the
husband
retorted
not
a
but
our
doctor
is
he
has
a
few
books
if
you
like
still
i
would
swop
him
he
much
too
fond
of
fashionable
novels
know
you
always
up
his
place
said
the
wife
i
wonder
what
should
do
if
it
was
for
the
doctor
novels
the
doctor
was
evidently
a
favourite
of
hers
not
always
up
at
his
place
the
husband
contradicted
know
perfectly
well
i
never
go
there
before
midnight
and
he
knows
perfectly
well
that
i
only
go
because
he
has
the
best
whisky
in
the
town
by
the
way
i
wonder
whether
he
knows
that
simon
fuge
is
dead
he
got
one
of
his
etchings
i
go
up
simon
fuge
asked
mrs
brindley
you
remember
old
fuge
that
kept
the
blue
bell
at
cauldon
simple
simon
well
his
son
i
remember
he
ran
away
from
home
once
did
he
and
his
mother
had
a
stain
on
her
left
cheek
oh
of
course
i
remember
him
perfectly
he
came
down
to
the
five
towns
some
years
ago
for
his
funeral
so
he
dead
who
told
you
loring
you
know
him
she
glanced
at
me
scarcely
knew
him
said
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
the
signal
signal
the
local
rag
mr
brindley
interpolated
it
in
the
gazette
birmingham
gazette
bright
creature
the
gazette
said
mr
brindley
she
seemed
puzzled
you
know
he
was
a
painter
the
husband
condescendingly
catechized
knew
he
used
to
teach
at
the
hanbridge
school
of
art
said
mrs
brindley
stoutly
would
let
me
go
there
because
of
that
then
he
got
the
sack
defenceless
thing
how
old
were
you
i
expect
much
obliged
to
your
mother
did
he
die
mrs
brindley
demanded
san
remo
i
answered
queer
him
dying
at
san
remo
in
september
does
it
remo
is
a
winter
place
no
one
ever
goes
there
before
december
is
it
the
lady
murmured
negligently
that
would
be
just
like
simon
fuge
was
never
afraid
of
him
she
added
in
a
defiant
tone
and
with
a
delicious
inconsequence
that
choked
her
husband
in
the
midst
of
a
draught
of
beer
can
laugh
she
said
sturdily
at
that
moment
there
was
heard
a
series
of
loud
explosive
sounds
in
the
street
they
continued
for
a
few
seconds
apparently
just
outside
the
window
then
they
stopped
and
the
noise
of
the
bumping
electric
cars
resumed
its
sway
over
the
ear
oliver
said
mr
brindley
looking
at
his
watch
must
have
come
from
manchester
in
an
hour
and
a
half
he
a
terror
quick
mrs
brindley
exclaimed
she
sprang
to
the
sideboard
and
seized
a
tumbler
which
mr
brindley
filled
from
a
second
bottle
of
bass
when
the
door
of
the
room
opened
she
was
standing
close
to
it
laughing
with
the
full
frothing
glass
in
her
hand
a
tall
thin
man
rather
younger
than
mr
brindley
and
his
wife
entered
he
wore
a
long
and
leggings
and
he
carried
a
motorist
cap
in
a
great
hand
no
one
spoke
but
little
puffs
of
laughter
escaped
all
mrs
brindley
efforts
to
imprison
her
mirth
then
the
visitor
took
the
glass
with
a
magnificent
broad
smile
and
said
in
a
rich
and
heavy
midland
voice
to
moy
wife
husband
and
drained
the
nectar
better
now
do
you
mrs
brindley
inquired
mrs
bob
i
do

the
reply
do

responded
my
host
laconically
and
then
with
gravity
loring
mr
oliver
colclough
thinks
he
knows
something
about
music
to
meet
you
sir
said
mr
colclough
shaking
hands
with
me
he
had
a
most
attractively
candid
smile
but
he
was
so
long
and
lanky
that
he
seemed
to
pervade
the
room
like
an
omnipresence
down
and
have
a
bit
of
cheese
oliver
said
mrs
brindley
as
she
herself
sat
down

village
mr
colclough
addressed
me
he
had
surrendered
to
the
stronger
will
london
i
said
but
i
heard
of
it
and
i
heard
it
in
manchester
last
week
and
we
thought
it
be
a
bit
of
a
lark
to
buy
the
arrangement
for
pianoforte
duet
and
listen
to
it
said
mr
brindley
is
if
nobody
wants
any
more
beer
iv
the
was
about
twice
as
large
as
the
and
it
contained
about
four
times
as
much
furniture
once
again
there
were
books
all
round
the
walls
a
grand
piano
covered
with
music
stood
in
a
corner
and
behind
was
a
cabinet
full
of
bound
music
mr
brindley
seated
on
one
corner
of
the
bench
in
front
of
the
piano
cut
the
leaves
of
the
sinfonia
domestica
the
devil
he
observed
lad
agreed
mr
colclough
standing
over
him
difficult
on
said
brindley
when
he
had
finished
cutting
take
your
off
had
you
mrs
brindley
suggested
to
the
friend
she
and
i
were
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
may
as
well
mr
colclough
admitted
and
threw
the
long
garment
on
to
a
chair
here
bob
my
hands
are
stiff
with
steering
find
fault
with
your
tools
said
mr
brindley
sit
down
no
my
boy
i
going
to
play
the
top
part
shove
along
want
to
play
the
top
part
because
it
easiest
mr
colclough
grumbled
often
have
i
told
you
the
top
part
is
never
easiest
who
do
you
suppose
is
going
to
keep
this
symphony
together
you
or
me
i
spoke
they
arranged
themselves
on
the
bench
and
mr
brindley
turned
up
the
lower
corners
of
every
alternate
leaf
of
the
music
said
he
her
zip
said
mr
colclough
they
began
to
play
and
then
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
whose
white
apron
was
starched
as
stiff
as
cardboard
came
in
carrying
a
tray
of
coffee
and
unholy
liqueurs
which
she
deposited
with
a
rattle
on
a
small
table
near
the
hostess
muttered
mr
brindley
and
stopped
very
complex
ai
it
bob
mr
colclough
murmured
lad
the
host
glanced
round
to
make
sure
that
the
rattling
servant
had
entirely
gone
start
again
a
minute
wait
a
minute
cried
mrs
brindley
excitedly
just
pouring
out
mr
loring
coffee
there
as
she
handed
me
the
cup
she
whispered
dare
talk
it
more
than
our
place
is
worth
the
performance
of
the
symphony
proceeded
to
me
who
am
not
a
performer
it
sounded
excessively
brilliant
and
incomprehensible
mr
colclough
stretched
his
right
hand
to
turn
over
the
page
and
fumbled
it
another
stoppage
you
ol
mr
brindley
exploded
wish
you
would
make
yourself
so
confoundedly
busy
leave
the
turning
to
me
it
takes
a
great
artist
to
turn
over
and
you
only
a
blooming
chauffeur
begin
again
mr
colclough
whispered
i
could
not
estimate
the
length
of
the
symphony
but
my
impression
was
one
of
extreme
length
halfway
through
it
the
players
both
took
their
coats
off
there
was
no
other
surcease
dost
think
of
it
bob
asked
mr
colclough
in
the
weird
silence
that
reigned
after
they
had
finished
they
were
standing
up
and
putting
on
their
coats
and
wiping
their
faces
think
what
i
thought
before
said
mr
brindley
childish
is
childish
the
other
protested
ugly
but
it
childish
childishly
clever
mr
brindley
modified
his
description
he
did
not
ask
my
opinion
cold
said
mrs
brindley
do
want
any
coffee
give
me
some
chartreuse
please
have
a
drop
o
green
ol
split
soda
be
more
in
my
line
besides
i
just
going
to
have
my
supper
never
mind
i
have
a
drop
missis
and
chance
it
never
tried
chartreuse
as
an
appetizer
at
this
point
commenced
a
sanguinary
conflict
of
wills
to
settle
whether
or
not
i
also
should
indulge
in
green
chartreuse
i
was
defeated
besides
the
chartreuse
i
accepted
a
cigar
never
before
or
since
have
i
been
such
a
buck
must
hook
it
said
mr
colclough
picking
up
his
yet
you
do
said
mr
brindley
got
to
get
the
taste
of
that
infernal
strauss
out
of
my
mouth
we
play
the
first
movement
of
the
g
minor
he
whistled
a
phrase
mr
colclough
obediently
sat
down
again
to
the
piano
the
mozart
was
like
an
idyll
after
a
farcical
melodrama
they
played
it
with
an
astounding
delicacy
through
the
latter
half
of
the
movement
i
could
hear
mr
brindley
breathing
regularly
and
heavily
through
his
nose
exactly
as
though
he
were
being
hypnotized
i
had
a
tickling
sensation
in
the
small
of
my
back
a
sure
sign
of
emotion
in
me
the
atmosphere
was
changed
a
heavenly
thing
i
exclaimed
enthusiastically
when
they
had
finished
mr
brindley
looked
at
me
sharply
and
just
nodded
in
silence
well
good
night
ol
say
said
mr
colclough
you
nothing
doing
later
on
bring
mr
loring
round
to
my
place
will
you
come
mr
loring
do
us
have
a
drink
these
five
towns
people
certainly
had
a
simple
sincere
way
of
offering
hospitality
that
was
quite
irresistible
one
could
see
that
hospitality
was
among
their
chief
and
keenest
pleasures
we
all
went
to
the
front
door
to
see
mr
colclough
depart
homewards
in
his
automobile
the
two
great
acetylene
sent
long
glaring
shafts
of
light
down
the
side
street
mr
colclough
throwing
the
score
of
the
sinfonia
domestica
into
the
tonneau
of
the
immense
car
put
on
a
pair
of
gloves
and
began
to
circulate
round
the
machine
tapping
here
screwing
there
as
chauffeurs
will
then
he
bent
down
in
front
to
start
the
engine
the
way
ol
mr
brindley
shouted
from
the
doorway
seems
simon
fuge
is
dead
we
could
see
the
man
stooping
form
between
the
two
he
turned
his
head
towards
the
house
the
dagger
is
simon
fuge
he
inquired
about
five
thousand
fuges
in
th
five
towns
i
thought
you
knew
him
might
and
i
might
it
not
one
o
them
fuge
brothers
at
longshaw
is
it
it
mr
colclough
had
succeeded
in
starting
his
engine
and
the
air
was
rent
with
he
jumped
lightly
into
the
driver
seat
see
you
later
he
cried
and
was
off
persuading
the
enormous
beast
under
him
to
describe
a
semicircle
in
the
narrow
street
backing
forcing
forward
and
backing
again
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
continuous
fusillade
at
length
he
got
away
drew
up
within
two
feet
of
an
electric
tram
that
slid
bumping
down
the
main
street
and
vanished
round
the
corner
a
little
ragged
boy
passed
crying
extra
and
mr
brindley
hailed
him
is
mr
colclough
i
asked
in
the
sanitary
ware
said
mr
brindley
got
one
of
the
best
businesses
in
hanbridge
i
wish
i
half
his
income
never
buys
a
book
you
know
seems
to
play
the
piano
very
well
as
to
that
he
does
what
you
may
call
play
but
he
the
best
in
this
district
bar
me
i
never
met
his
equal
when
you
come
across
any
one
who
can
read
a
thing
like
the
domestic
symphony
right
off
and
never
miss
his
place
you
might
send
me
a
telegram
colclough
got
a
steinway
wish
i
had
mrs
brindley
had
been
looking
through
the
signal
do
see
anything
about
simon
fuge
here
said
she
nonsense
said
her
husband
sure
to
have
got
something
in
about
it
let
look
he
received
the
paper
from
his
wife
but
failed
to
discover
in
it
a
word
concerning
the
death
of
simon
fuge
if
i
do
ring
buchanan
up
and
ask
him
what
he
means
here
a
paper
with
an
absolute
monopoly
in
the
district
and
brings
in
about
five
thousand
a
year
clear
to
somebody
and
it
does
give
the
news
there
never
is
anything
but
advertisements
and
sporting
results
in
the
blessed
thing
he
rushed
to
his
telephone
which
was
in
the
hall
or
rather
he
did
not
rush
he
went
extremely
quickly
with
aggressive
footsteps
that
seemed
to
symbolize
just
retribution
we
could
hear
him
at
the
telephone
no
yes
is
that
you
buchanan
well
i
want
mr
buchanan
is
that
you
buchanan
yes
i
all
right
what
in
thunder
do
you
mean
by
having
nothing
in
tonight
about
simon
fuge
death
eh
yes
the
gazette
well
i
suppose
you
are
scotch
for
nothing
why
the
devil
could
you
stop
in
scotland
and
edit
papers
there
then
a
laugh
see
yes
what
did
you
think
of
those
cigars
oh
see
you
at
the
dinner
a
final
ring
real
truth
is
he
wanted
some
advice
as
to
the
tone
of
his
obituary
notice
said
mr
brindley
coming
back
into
the
got
it
seemingly
he
says
he
writing
it
now
for
tomorrow
he
did
put
in
the
mere
news
of
the
death
because
it
was
exclusive
to
the
gazette
and
he
been
having
some
difficulty
with
the
gazette
lately
as
he
says
tomorrow
afternoon
will
be
quite
soon
enough
for
the
five
towns
it
is
as
if
simon
fuge
was
a
cricket
match
so
now
you
see
how
the
wheels
go
round
mr
loring
he
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
began
to
play
softly
the
castle
motive
from
the
nibelung
ring
he
kept
repeating
it
in
different
keys
about
the
mumps
wife
he
asked
mrs
brindley
who
had
been
out
of
the
room
and
now
returned
i
do
think
it
is
mumps
she
replied
all
asleep
he
murmured
still
playing
the
castle
motive
of
simon
fuge
i
said
determined
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
were
the
two
sisters
two
sisters
he
spent
the
night
in
the
boat
with
on
ilam
lake
that
in
the
gazette
i
did
read
all
the
article
he
changed
abruptly
into
the
sword
motive
which
he
gave
with
a
violent
flourish
and
then
he
left
the
piano
do
beg
you
not
to
wake
my
children
said
his
wife
children
must
get
used
to
my
piano
said
he
then
what
about
these
two
sisters
i
pulled
the
gazette
from
my
pocket
and
handed
it
to
him
he
read
aloud
the
passage
describing
the
magic
night
on
the
lake
do
know
who
they
were
he
said
something
tasty
from
the
hanbridge
empire
we
both
observed
a
faint
amused
smile
on
the
face
of
mrs
brindley
the
smile
of
a
woman
who
has
suddenly
discovered
in
her
brain
a
piece
of
knowledge
rare
and
piquant
can
guess
who
they
were
she
said
fact
i
sure
brett
and
you
know
who
down
at
the
tiger
hush
mrs
brindley
ran
to
the
door
and
opening
it
listened
the
faint
fretful
cry
of
a
child
reached
us
done
it
i
told
you
you
would
she
disappeared
mr
brindley
whistled
who
is
annie
brett
i
inquired
here
said
he
with
a
peculiar
inflection
you
like
to
see
her
should
i
said
with
decision
come
on
then
we
go
down
to
the
tiger
and
have
a
drop
of
something
the
other
sister
i
asked
other
sister
is
mrs
oliver
colclough
he
answered
ai
it
again
there
was
that
swift
scarcely
perceptible
phenomenon
in
his
eyes
v
we
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
and
the
main
road
and
down
the
main
road
a
vast
white
rectangular
cube
of
bright
light
came
plunging
its
head
rising
and
dipping
at
express
speed
and
with
a
formidable
roar
mr
brindley
imperiously
raised
his
stick
the
extraordinary
box
of
light
stopped
as
if
by
a
miracle
and
we
jumped
into
it
having
splashed
through
mud
and
it
plunged
off
again
bump
bump
bump
into
the
town
of
bursley
as
mr
brindley
passed
into
the
interior
of
the
car
he
said
laconically
to
two
men
who
were
smoking
on
the
platform
do
jim
how
do
jo
and
they
responded
laconically
do
bob
do
bob
we
sat
down
mr
brindley
pointed
to
the
condition
of
the
floor
is
it
he
observed
to
me
shouting
above
the
din
of
vibrating
glass
our
were
few
and
unromantic
perhaps
altogether
on
the
long
shiny
yellow
seats
of
the
car
each
apparently
lost
in
gloomy
reverie
the
advertisements
and
notices
in
these
cars
that
are
the
joy
of
the
like
you
and
me
shouted
mr
brindley
there
passengers
are
requested
not
to
spit
on
the
floor
simply
an
encouragement
to
lie
on
the
seats
and
spit
on
the
ceiling
is
it
wear
only
noble
wonderful
boots
suppose
we
did
unless
they
came
well
up
above
the
waist
we
should
be
prosecuted
but
there
no
sense
of
humour
in
this
district
greengrocers
shops
and
were
now
flying
past
the
windows
of
the
car
it
began
to
climb
a
hill
and
then
halted
we
are
ejaculated
mr
brindley
and
he
was
out
of
the
car
almost
before
i
had
risen
we
strolled
along
a
quiet
street
and
came
to
a
large
building
with
many
large
lighted
windows
evidently
some
result
of
public
effort
that
place
i
demanded
the
wedgwood
institution
so
that
the
wedgwood
institution
is
it
commonly
called
the
wedgwood
museum
public
library
dirtiest
books
in
the
world
i
mean
physically
art
school
science
school
i
never
explained
to
you
why
i
chairman
of
the
management
committee
have
i
well
it
because
the
institution
is
meant
to
foster
the
arts
and
i
happen
to
know
nothing
about
i
need
tell
you
that
architecture
literature
and
music
are
not
arts
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
not
much
like
to
come
in
and
see
the
museum
for
a
minute
you
have
to
see
it
in
your
official
capacity
tomorrow
we
crossed
the
road
and
entered
an
imposing
portico
just
as
we
did
so
a
thick
stream
of
slouching
men
began
to
descend
the
steps
like
a
waterfall
of
treacle
mr
brindley
they
appeared
to
see
but
evidently
i
made
no
impression
on
their
retinas
they
bore
down
the
steps
hands
deep
in
pockets
sweeping
over
me
like
fate
even
when
i
bounced
off
one
of
them
to
a
lower
step
he
showed
by
no
sign
that
the
fact
of
my
existence
had
reached
his
consciousness
simply
bore
irresistibly
downwards
the
crowd
was
absolutely
silent
at
last
i
gained
the
entrance
hall
for
the
reading
room
said
mr
brindley
glad
i
survived
it
i
said
truth
is
said
he
people
who
ca
look
after
themselves
do
flourish
in
these
latitudes
but
you
be
acclimatized
by
tomorrow
see
that
he
pointed
to
an
alabaster
tablet
on
which
was
engraved
a
record
of
the
historical
certainty
that
mr
gladstone
opened
the
institution
in
also
an
extract
from
the
speech
which
he
delivered
on
that
occasion
do
you
think
of
gladstone
down
here
i
demanded
my
official
capacity
i
think
that
these
deathless
words
are
the
last
utterance
of
wisdom
on
the
subject
of
the
influence
of
the
liberal
arts
on
life
and
i
should
advise
you
in
your
official
capacity
to
think
the
same
unless
you
happen
to
have
a
fancy
for
having
your
teeth
knocked
down
your
throat
see
i
said
not
sure
how
to
take
him
you
should
go
away
with
the
idea
that
you
have
been
visiting
a
rude
and
barbaric
people
i
better
explain
that
that
was
a
joke
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
rather
enlightened
here
the
only
man
who
stands
a
chance
of
getting
his
teeth
knocked
down
his
throat
here
is
the
ingenious
person
who
started
the
celebrated
legend
of
the
fight
at
hanbridge
it
a
long
time
ago
a
very
long
time
ago
but
his
grey
hairs
wo
save
him
from
horrible
tortures
if
we
catch
him
we
do
mind
being
called
immoral
we
above
a
bit
flattered
when
london
newspapers
come
out
with
shocking
details
of
debauchery
in
the
five
towns
but
we
pride
ourselves
on
our
manners
i
say
aked
his
voice
rose
commandingly
threateningly
to
an
old
bent
spectacled
man
who
was
ascending
a
broad
white
staircase
in
front
of
us
the
man
turned
turn
the
lights
out
yet
in
the
museum
sir
are
you
coming
up
the
accents
were
slow
and
tremulous
i
have
a
gentleman
here
from
the
british
museum
who
wants
to
look
round
the
oldish
man
came
deliberately
down
the
steps
and
approached
us
then
his
gaze
beginning
at
my
waist
gradually
rose
to
my
hat
the
british
museum
he
drawled
sure
i
very
glad
to
meet
you
sir
i
sure
it
a
very
great
honour
he
held
out
a
wrinkled
hand
which
i
shook
aked
said
mr
brindley
by
way
of
introduction
caretaker
here
for
pretty
near
forty
years
since
it
opened
sir
said
aked
we
went
up
the
white
stone
stairway
rather
a
grandiose
construction
for
a
little
industrial
town
it
divided
itself
into
doubling
curving
flights
at
the
first
landing
and
its
walls
were
covered
with
pictures
and
designs
the
museum
itself
a
series
of
three
communicating
rooms
was
about
as
large
as
a
small
i
said
i
gave
my
impression
candidly
because
i
had
already
judged
mr
brindley
to
be
the
rare
and
precious
individual
who
is
worthy
of
the
high
honour
of
frankness
you
think
so
he
demanded
quickly
i
had
shocked
him
that
was
clear
his
tone
was
unmistakable
it
indicated
an
instinctive
involuntary
protest
but
he
recovered
himself
in
a
flash
jealousy
he
laughed
you
british
museum
people
are
the
same
then
he
added
with
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
convince
me
that
he
meant
what
he
was
saying
course
it
is
small
it
nothing
simply
nothing
yes
i
had
unwittingly
found
the
joint
in
the
armour
of
this
extraordinary
midland
personage
with
all
his
irony
with
all
his
violent
humour
with
all
his
just
and
unprejudiced
perceptions
he
had
a
tenderness
for
the
institution
of
which
he
was
the
dictator
he
loved
it
he
could
laugh
like
a
god
at
everything
in
the
five
towns
except
this
one
thing
he
would
try
to
force
himself
to
regard
even
this
with
the
same
lofty
detachment
but
he
could
not
do
it
naturally
i
stopped
at
a
case
of
wedgwood
ware
marked
collection
jove
i
exclaimed
pointing
to
a
vase
a
body
he
was
enchanted
by
my
enthusiasm
you
should
have
hit
on
that
said
he
daddy
perkins
always
called
it
his
thus
spoken
the
name
of
the
greatest
authority
on
wedgwood
ware
that
europe
has
ever
known
curiously
impressed
me
suppose
you
knew
him
i
questioned
that
i
was
one
of
the
at
his
funeral
and
caught
the
champion
cold
of
my
life
sort
of
a
man
was
he
wedgwood
ware
he
was
any
sort
of
a
man
he
was
that
scourge
of
society
a
philanthropist
said
mr
brindley
was
an
upright
citizen
and
two
thousand
people
followed
him
to
his
grave
i
an
upright
citizen
but
i
have
no
hope
that
two
thousand
people
will
follow
me
to
my
grave
never
know
what
may
happen
i
observed
smiling
he
shook
his
head
you
undermine
the
moral
character
of
your
by
a
long
course
of
unbridled
miscellaneous
philanthropy
you
can
have
a
funeral
procession
as
long
as
you
like
at
the
rate
of
about
forty
shillings
a
foot
but
you
never
touch
the
great
heart
of
the
enlightened
public
of
these
boroughs
in
any
other
way
do
you
imagine
anyone
cared
a
twopenny
damn
for
perkins
wedgwood
ware
like
that
everywhere
i
said
suppose
it
is
he
assented
unwillingly
who
can
tell
what
was
passing
in
the
breast
of
mr
brindley
i
could
not
at
least
i
could
not
tell
with
any
precision
i
could
only
gather
vaguely
that
what
he
considered
the
the
blindness
the
lack
of
true
perception
of
his
public
was
beginning
to
produce
in
his
individuality
a
faint
trace
of
permanent
soreness
i
regretted
it
and
i
showed
my
sympathy
with
him
by
asking
questions
about
the
design
and
construction
of
the
museum
a
late
addition
to
the
institution
of
which
i
happened
to
know
that
he
had
been
the
architect
he
at
once
became
interested
and
interesting
although
he
perhaps
insisted
a
little
too
much
on
the
difficulties
which
occur
when
original
talent
encounters
stupidity
he
did
as
he
walked
me
up
and
down
contrive
to
convey
to
me
a
notion
of
the
creative
processes
of
the
architect
in
a
way
that
was
in
my
experience
entirely
novel
he
was
impressing
me
anew
and
i
was
wondering
whether
he
was
unique
of
his
kind
or
whether
there
existed
regiments
of
him
in
this
strange
parcel
of
england
you
see
this
girder
he
said
looking
upwards
that
surely
something
of
fuge
is
it
i
asked
indicating
a
small
picture
in
a
corner
after
he
had
finished
his
explanation
of
the
functions
of
the
girder
as
on
the
walls
of
the
staircase
and
corridors
so
on
the
walls
here
there
were
many
paintings
drawings
and
engravings
and
of
course
the
best
were
here
in
the
museum
the
least
uninteresting
items
of
the
collection
were
speaking
generally
reproductions
in
monotint
of
celebrated
works
and
a
few
second
or
loan
pictures
from
south
kensington
aside
from
such
matters
i
had
noticed
nothing
but
the
usual
local
trivialities
gifts
from
one
citizen
or
another
of
some
careful
daubs
of
apt
students
without
a
sense
of
humour
the
aspect
of
the
place
was
exactly
the
customary
aspect
of
the
small
provincial
museum
as
i
have
seen
it
in
towns
that
are
not
among
great
towns
it
had
the
terrible
trite
aspect
the
aspect
that
brings
woe
and
desolation
to
the
heart
of
the
stoutest
visitor
and
which
seems
to
form
part
of
the
purgatorio
of
wide
mouths
and
stiff
clothes
the
movement
for
opening
museums
on
sundays
is
the
most
natural
movement
that
could
be
conceived
for
if
ever
a
resort
was
invented
and
to
chime
with
the
true
spirit
of
the
british
sabbath
that
resort
is
the
average
museum
i
ought
to
know
i
do
know
but
there
was
the
incomparable
wedgwood
ware
and
there
was
the
little
picture
by
simon
fuge
i
am
not
going
to
lose
my
sense
of
perspective
concerning
simon
fuge
he
was
not
the
greatest
painter
that
ever
lived
or
even
of
his
time
he
had
i
am
ready
to
believe
very
grave
limitations
but
he
was
a
painter
by
himself
as
all
fine
painters
are
he
had
his
own
vision
he
was
unique
he
was
exclusively
preoccupied
with
the
beauty
and
the
romance
of
the
authentic
the
little
picture
showed
all
this
it
was
a
painting
unfinished
of
a
girl
standing
at
a
door
and
evidently
hesitating
whether
to
open
the
door
or
not
a
very
young
girl
very
thin
with
long
legs
in
black
stockings
and
short
white
untidy
frock
thin
bare
arms
the
head
thrown
on
one
side
and
the
hands
raised
and
one
foot
raised
in
a
wonderful
childish
gesture
the
gesture
of
an
undecided
the
face
was
an
infant
face
utterly
innocent
and
yet
simon
fuge
had
somehow
caught
in
that
face
a
glimpse
of
all
the
future
of
the
woman
that
the
girl
was
to
be
he
had
displayed
with
exquisite
insolence
the
essential
naughtiness
of
his
vision
of
things
the
thing
was
not
much
more
than
a
sketch
it
was
a
happy
accident
perhaps
in
some
day
work
of
simon
fuge
but
it
was
genius
when
once
you
had
yielded
to
it
there
was
no
other
picture
in
the
room
it
killed
everything
else
but
wherever
it
had
found
itself
nothing
could
have
killed
it
its
success
was
undeniable
indestructible
and
it
glowed
sombrely
there
on
the
wall
a
few
splashes
of
colour
on
a
morsel
of
canvas
and
it
was
simon
unconscious
proud
challenge
to
the
five
towns
it
was
simon
fuge
at
any
rate
all
of
simon
fuge
that
was
worth
having
masterful
imperishable
and
not
merely
was
it
his
challenge
it
was
his
scorn
his
aristocratic
disdain
his
positive
assurance
that
in
the
battle
between
them
he
had
annihilated
the
five
towns
it
hung
there
in
the
very
midst
thereof
calmly
and
contemptuously
waiting
for
the
acknowledgement
of
his
victory
said
mr
brindley
that
one
i
fancy
it
is
he
negligently
agreed
it
is
not
signed
i
remarked
ought
to
be
said
mr
brindley
then
laughed
late
now
did
it
get
here
know
oh
i
think
mr
perkins
won
it
in
a
raffle
at
a
bazaar
and
then
hung
it
here
he
did
as
he
liked
here
you
know
i
was
just
going
to
become
vocal
in
its
praise
when
mr
brindley
said
thing
under
it
is
a
photograph
of
a
for
which
one
of
our
pupils
won
a
national
scholarship
last
year
mr
aked
appeared
in
the
distance
fancy
the
old
boy
wants
to
be
off
to
bed
mr
brindley
whispered
kindly
so
we
left
the
wedgwood
institution
i
began
to
talk
to
mr
brindley
about
music
the
barbaric
attitude
of
the
five
towns
towards
great
music
was
the
theme
of
some
very
lively
animadversions
on
his
part
vi
the
tiger
was
very
conveniently
close
to
the
wedgwood
institution
the
tiger
had
a
one
of
those
long
shapeless
expanses
of
the
planet
partly
paved
with
uneven
cobbles
and
partly
unsophisticated
planet
without
which
no
provincial
hotel
can
call
itself
respectable
we
came
into
it
from
the
hinterland
through
a
wooden
doorway
in
a
brick
wall
far
off
i
could
see
one
light
burning
we
were
in
the
centre
of
bursley
the
gold
angel
of
its
town
hall
rose
handsomely
over
the
roof
of
the
hotel
in
the
diffused
moonlight
but
we
might
have
been
in
the
purlieus
of
some
dubious
establishment
on
the
confines
of
a
great
seaport
where
anything
may
happen
the
yard
was
so
deserted
so
mysterious
so
shut
in
so
silent
that
really
infamous
characters
ought
to
have
rushed
out
at
us
from
the
obscurity
of
shadows
and
felled
us
to
the
earth
with
no
other
attendant
phenomenon
than
a
low
groan
there
are
places
where
one
seems
to
feel
how
thin
and
brittle
is
the
crust
of
law
and
order
why
one
should
be
conscious
of
this
in
the
precincts
of
such
a
house
as
the
tiger
which
i
was
given
to
understand
is
as
respectable
as
the
parish
church
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
experienced
a
similar
feeling
in
the
yards
of
other
provincial
hotels
that
were
also
as
correct
as
parish
churches
we
passed
a
dim
fly
with
its
shafts
slanting
forlornly
to
the
ground
and
a
wheelbarrow
both
looked
as
though
they
had
been
abandoned
for
ever
then
we
came
to
the
lamp
which
illuminated
a
door
and
on
the
door
was
a
notice
bar
billiards
i
am
not
a
frequenter
of
convivial
haunts
i
should
not
dare
to
penetrate
alone
into
a
private
bar
when
i
do
enter
a
private
bar
it
is
invariably
under
the
august
protection
of
an
habitue
and
it
is
invariably
with
the
idea
that
at
last
i
am
going
to
see
life
often
has
this
illusion
been
shattered
but
each
time
it
perfectly
renewed
itself
so
i
followed
the
bold
mr
brindley
into
the
private
bar
of
the
tiger
it
was
a
small
and
low
room
i
instinctively
stooped
though
there
was
no
necessity
for
me
to
stoop
the
bar
had
no
peculiarity
it
can
be
described
in
a
breath
three
perpendicular
planes
back
plane
bottles
arranged
exactly
like
books
on
bookshelves
middle
plane
the
upper
halves
of
two
women
dressed
in
tight
black
front
plane
a
counter
dotted
with
glasses
and
having
strange
areas
of
zinc
reckon
all
that
as
the
stage
and
the
rest
of
the
room
as
auditorium
but
the
stage
of
a
private
bar
is
more
mysterious
than
the
stage
of
a
theatre
you
are
closer
to
it
and
yet
it
is
far
less
approachable
the
edge
of
the
counter
is
more
sacred
than
the
footlights
impossible
to
imagine
yourself
leaping
over
it
impossible
to
imagine
yourself
in
that
cloistered
place
behind
it
impossible
to
imagine
how
the
priestesses
got
themselves
into
that
place
or
that
they
ever
leave
it
they
are
always
there
they
are
always
the
same
you
may
go
into
a
theatre
when
it
is
empty
and
dark
but
did
you
ever
go
into
a
private
bar
that
was
empty
and
dark
a
private
bar
is
as
eternal
as
the
hills
as
changeless
as
the
monomania
of
a
madman
as
mysterious
as
sorcery
always
the
same
order
of
bottles
the
same
tinkling
the
same
popping
the
same
and
the
same
realistic
pictures
of
frothing
champagne
on
the
walls
the
same
advertisements
on
the
same
on
the
counter
the
same
odour
that
wipes
your
face
like
a
towel
the
instant
you
enter
and
the
same
smiles
the
same
gestures
the
same
black
fabric
stretched
to
tension
over
the
same
impressive
mammiferous
phenomena
of
the
same
inexplicable
creatures
who
apparently
never
eat
and
never
sleep
imprisoned
for
life
in
the
hallowed
and
mystic
hollow
between
the
bottles
and
the
zinc
in
a
tone
almost
inaudible
in
its
discretion
mr
brindley
let
fall
to
me
as
he
went
in
this
is
she
she
was
not
quite
the
ordinary
barmaid
nor
as
i
learnt
afterwards
was
she
considered
to
be
the
ordinary
barmaid
she
was
something
midway
in
importance
between
the
wife
of
the
new
proprietor
and
the
younger
woman
who
stood
beside
her
in
the
cloister
talking
to
a
being
that
resembled
a
commercial
traveller
it
was
the
younger
woman
who
was
the
ordinary
barmaid
she
had
bright
hair
and
the
bright
vacant
stupidity
which
in
my
narrow
experience
barmaids
so
often
catch
like
an
infectious
disease
from
their
clients
but
annie
brett
was
different
i
can
best
explain
how
she
impressed
me
by
saying
that
she
had
the
mien
of
a
handsome
married
woman
of
forty
with
a
coquettish
and
superficially
emotional
past
but
also
with
a
daughter
who
is
just
going
into
long
skirts
i
have
known
one
or
two
such
women
they
have
been
beautiful
they
are
still
handsome
at
a
distance
of
twelve
feet
they
are
rather
effusive
they
think
they
know
life
when
as
a
fact
their
instinctive
repugnance
for
any
form
of
truth
has
prevented
them
from
acquiring
even
the
rudiments
of
the
knowledge
of
life
they
are
secretly
preoccupied
by
the
burning
question
of
obesity
they
flatter
and
they
will
pay
any
price
for
flattery
they
are
never
sincere
not
even
with
themselves
they
never
during
the
whole
of
their
existence
utter
a
sincere
word
even
in
anger
they
coldly
exaggerate
they
are
always
frothing
at
the
mouth
with
ecstasy
they
adore
everything
including
god
go
to
church
carrying
a
and
in
separate
volumes
and
absolutely
fawn
on
the
daughter
they
are
stylish
and
impenetrable
but
there
is
something
about
them
very
wistful
and
tragic
in
another
social
stratum
miss
annie
brett
might
have
been
such
a
woman
without
doubt
nature
had
intended
her
for
the
role
she
was
just
a
little
ample
with
broad
shoulders
and
a
large
head
and
a
lot
of
dark
chestnut
hair
a
large
mouth
and
large
teeth
she
had
earrings
a
brooch
and
several
rings
also
a
neat
originality
of
cuffs
that
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
an
ordinary
barmaid
as
for
her
face
there
were
and
a
mole
which
had
selected
with
infinite
skill
a
site
on
her
chin
and
a
general
degeneracy
of
complexion
but
it
was
an
effective
face
the
little
thing
of
or
so
by
her
side
had
all
the
cruel
advantages
of
youth
and
was
not
ugly
but
she
was
by
annie
brett
miss
brett
had
a
maternal
bust
indeed
something
of
the
maternal
resided
in
all
of
her
that
was
visible
above
the
zinc
she
must
have
been
about
forty
that
is
to
say
apparently
older
than
the
late
simon
fuge
nevertheless
i
could
conceive
her
even
now
speciously
picturesque
in
a
boat
at
midnight
on
a
moonstruck
water
had
she
been
on
the
stage
she
would
have
been
looking
forward
to
ingenue
parts
for
another
five
years
yet
such
was
her
durable
sort
of
effectiveness
yes
she
indubitably
belonged
to
the
ornamental
half
of
the
universe
this
is
one
of
them
i
said
to
myself
i
tried
to
be
philosophical
but
at
heart
i
was
profoundly
disappointed
i
did
not
know
what
i
had
expected
but
i
had
not
expected
that
i
was
well
aware
that
a
thing
written
always
takes
on
a
quality
which
does
not
justly
appertain
to
it
i
had
not
expected
therefore
to
see
an
odalisque
a
houri
an
ideal
toy
or
the
remains
of
an
ideal
toy
i
had
not
expected
any
kind
of
obvious
brilliancy
nor
a
subtle
charm
that
would
haunt
my
memory
for
evermore
on
the
other
hand
i
had
not
expected
the
banal
the
perfectly
commonplace
and
i
think
that
miss
annie
brett
was
the
most
banal
person
that
it
has
pleased
fate
to
send
into
my
life
i
knew
that
instantly
she
was
a
condemnation
of
simon
fuge
she
one
of
the
creatures
who
had
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
career
of
simon
fuge
sapristi
still
she
was
one
of
the
wonderful
creatures
etc
she
had
floated
the
bosom
of
the
lake
with
a
great
artist
she
had
received
his
homage
she
had
stirred
his
feelings
she
had
shared
with
him
the
magic
of
the
night
i
might
decry
her
as
i
would
she
had
known
how
to
cast
a
spell
over
him
she
and
the
other
one
something
there
in
her
which
had
captured
him
and
seemingly
held
him
captive
mr
brindley
she
expanded
quite
a
stranger
and
she
embraced
me
also
in
the
largeness
of
her
welcome
just
happens
said
mr
brindley
i
was
here
last
night
but
you
were
you
now
she
exclaimed
as
though
learning
a
novel
fact
of
the
most
passionate
interest
the
truth
is
i
had
to
leave
the
bar
to
miss
slaney
last
night
mrs
moorcroft
was
ill
and
the
baby
only
six
weeks
old
you
know
and
i
would
leave
her
no
i
would
it
was
plain
that
in
miss
annie
brett
opinion
there
was
only
one
really
capable
intelligence
in
the
tiger
this
glimpse
of
her
capability
this
of
the
latent
maternal
in
her
completely
destroyed
for
the
moment
my
vision
of
her
afloat
on
the
bosom
of
the
lake
see
said
mr
brindley
kindly
then
he
turned
to
me
with
characteristic
abruptness
give
it
a
name
mr
loring
such
is
my
simplicity
that
i
did
not
immediately
comprehend
his
meaning
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
i
thought
of
the
baby
then
i
perceived
that
he
was
merely
employing
one
of
the
sacred
phrases
sanctified
by
centuries
of
usage
of
the
private
bar
i
had
already
drunk
mercurey
green
chartreuse
and
coffee
i
had
a
violent
desire
not
to
drink
anything
more
i
knew
my
deplorable
tomorrows
still
i
would
have
drunk
hot
milk
cold
water
soda
water
or
tea
why
should
i
not
have
had
what
i
did
not
object
to
having
herein
lies
another
mystery
of
the
private
bar
one
could
surely
order
tea
or
milk
or
soda
water
from
a
woman
who
left
everything
to
tend
a
mother
with
a
baby
but
no
one
could
not
as
miss
annie
brett
smiled
at
me
pointedly
and
rubbed
her
ringed
hands
and
kept
on
smiling
with
her
terrific
mechanical
effusiveness
i
lost
all
my
self
control
i
would
have
resigned
myself
to
a
hundred
horrible
tomorrows
under
the
omnipotent
inexplicable
influence
of
the
private
bar
i
ejaculated
as
though
to
the
manner
born
it
proved
to
have
been
rather
clever
of
me
showing
as
it
did
a
due
regard
for
convention
combined
with
a
pretty
idiosyncrasy
mr
brindley
was
clearly
taken
aback
the
idea
struck
him
as
a
new
one
he
reflected
and
then
enthusiastically
exclaimed
if
i
do
have
irish
too
and
miss
brett
delighted
by
this
unexpected
note
of
irish
in
the
long
long
symphony
of
scotch
charged
our
glasses
with
gusto
i
sipped
death
in
my
heart
and
rakishness
in
my
face
and
gesture
mr
brindley
raised
his
glass
respectfully
to
miss
annie
brett
and
i
did
the
same
those
two
were
evidently
good
friends
she
led
the
conversation
with
hard
accustomed
ease
when
i
say
i
do
not
in
the
least
mean
unsympathetic
but
her
sympathetic
quality
was
toughened
by
excessive
usage
like
the
hand
of
a
charwoman
she
spoke
of
the
vagaries
of
the
town
hall
clock
the
health
of
mr
brindley
children
the
price
of
coal
the
incidence
of
the
annual
wakes
the
bankruptcy
of
the
draper
next
door
and
her
own
sciatica
all
in
the
same
tone
of
metallic
tender
solicitude
mr
brindley
adopted
an
entirely
serious
attitude
towards
her
if
i
had
met
him
there
and
nowhere
else
i
should
have
taken
him
for
a
dignified
mediocrity
little
better
than
a
fool
but
with
just
enough
discretion
not
to
give
himself
away
i
said
nothing
i
was
shy
i
always
am
shy
in
a
bar
out
of
her
cold
cold
roving
eye
miss
brett
watched
me
trying
to
add
me
up
and
not
succeeding
she
must
have
perceived
however
that
i
was
not
like
a
fish
in
water
there
was
a
pause
in
the
talk
due
i
think
to
miss
annie
preoccupation
with
what
was
going
on
between
miss
slaney
the
ordinary
barmaid
and
her
commercial
traveller
the
commercial
traveller
if
he
was
one
was
reading
something
from
a
newspaper
to
miss
slaney
in
an
indistinct
murmur
and
with
laughter
in
his
voice
the
way
said
mr
brindley
used
to
know
simon
fuge
you
simon
fuge
said
miss
brett
after
the
brewery
company
took
the
blue
bell
at
cauldon
over
from
him
i
used
to
be
there
he
would
come
in
sometimes
such
a
nice
queer
old
man
mean
the
son
said
mr
brindley
yes
she
answered
knew
young
mr
simon
too
a
slight
hesitation
and
then
course
another
hesitation
said
mr
brindley
he
dead
do
mean
to
say
he
dead
she
exclaimed
before
yesterday
in
italy
said
mr
brindley
ruthlessly
miss
annie
brett
manner
certainly
changed
it
seemed
almost
to
become
natural
and
unecstatic
suppose
it
will
be
in
the
papers
she
ventured
in
the
london
paper
i
never
she
muttered
long
time
i
should
think
since
he
was
in
this
part
of
the
world
said
mr
brindley
did
you
last
see
him
he
was
exceedingly
skilful
i
considered
she
put
the
back
of
her
hand
over
her
mouth
and
bending
her
head
slightly
and
lowering
her
eyelids
gazed
reflectively
at
the
counter
was
once
when
a
lot
of
us
went
to
ilam
she
answered
quietly
st
luke
lot
you
know
cried
mr
brindley
apparently
startled
st
luke
lot
came
he
to
go
with
you
did
go
with
us
he
was
there
stopping
there
i
suppose
i
believe
i
remember
hearing
something
about
that
said
mr
brindley
cunningly
he
take
you
out
in
a
boat
a
very
faint
dark
crimson
spread
over
the
face
of
miss
annie
brett
it
could
not
be
called
a
blush
but
it
was
as
like
a
blush
as
was
possible
to
her
the
phenomenon
as
i
could
see
from
his
eyes
gave
mr
brindley
another
shock
she
replied
was
there
as
well
then
a
silence
during
which
the
commercial
traveller
could
be
heard
reading
from
the
newspaper
was
that
gently
asked
mr
brindley
ask
me
when
it
was
mr
brindley
she
answered
nervously
ever
so
long
ago
what
did
he
die
of
know
miss
annie
brett
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
and
did
not
speak
there
were
tears
in
her
reddened
eyes
i
felt
very
awkward
and
i
think
that
mr
brindley
also
felt
awkward
but
i
was
glad
those
moist
eyes
caused
me
a
thrill
there
was
after
all
some
humanity
in
miss
annie
brett
yes
she
had
after
all
floated
on
the
bosom
of
the
lake
with
simon
fuge
the
least
romantic
of
persons
she
had
yet
felt
romance
if
she
had
touched
simon
fuge
simon
fuge
had
touched
her
she
had
memories
once
she
had
lived
i
pictured
her
younger
i
sought
in
her
face
the
soft
remains
of
youthfulness
i
invented
languishing
poses
for
her
in
the
boat
my
imagination
was
equal
to
the
task
of
seeing
her
as
simon
fuge
saw
her
i
did
so
see
her
i
recalled
simon
fuge
excited
description
of
the
long
night
in
the
boat
and
i
could
reconstitute
the
night
from
end
to
end
and
there
the
identical
creature
stood
before
me
the
creature
who
had
set
fire
to
simon
fuge
one
of
the
creatures
of
the
gazette
ageing
hardened
banal
but
momentarily
restored
to
the
empire
of
romance
by
those
unshed
glittering
tears
as
an
experience
it
was
worth
having
she
could
not
speak
and
we
did
not
i
heard
the
commercial
traveller
reading
the
motion
was
therefore
carried
by
votes
to
nineteen
and
the
countess
of
chell
promised
that
the
whole
question
of
the
employment
of
barmaids
should
be
raised
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
miss
annie
brett
moved
quickly
towards
the
commercial
traveller
til
tell
you
what
think
of
it
she
said
with
ecstatic
resentment
think
it
just
shameful
why
should
the
countess
of
chell
want
to
rob
a
lot
of
respectable
young
ladies
of
their
living
i
can
tell
you
they
just
as
respectable
as
the
countess
of
chell
is
yes
and
perhaps
more
by
all
accounts
i
think
people
do
well
to
call
her
interfering
iris
when
she
robbed
them
of
their
living
what
does
she
expect
them
to
do
is
she
going
to
keep
them
then
what
does
she
expect
them
to
do
the
commercial
traveller
was
inept
enough
to
offer
a
jocular
reply
and
then
he
found
himself
involved
in
the
morass
of
whole
question
he
and
we
also
were
obliged
to
hear
in
immense
detail
miss
annie
brett
complete
notions
of
the
movement
for
the
abolition
of
barmaids
the
subject
was
heavy
on
her
mind
and
she
lifted
it
off
simon
fuge
was
relinquished
he
dropped
like
a
stone
into
the
pool
of
forgetfulness
and
yet
strange
as
it
seems
she
was
assuredly
not
sincere
in
the
expression
of
her
views
on
the
question
of
barmaids
she
held
no
real
views
she
merely
persuaded
herself
that
she
held
them
when
the
commercial
traveller
who
was
devoid
of
sense
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
proposed
to
rob
anybody
of
a
livelihood
and
that
existent
barmaids
would
be
permitted
to
continue
to
grace
the
counters
of
their
adoption
she
grew
frostily
vicious
the
commercial
traveller
decided
to
retire
and
play
billiards
mr
brindley
and
i
in
our
turn
departed
i
was
extremely
disappointed
by
this
sequel
breathed
mr
brindley
when
we
were
outside
in
front
of
the
town
hall
was
quite
right
about
that
clock
after
that
we
turned
silently
into
a
long
illuminated
street
which
rose
gently
the
boxes
of
light
were
flashing
up
and
down
it
but
otherwise
it
seemed
to
be
quite
deserted
mr
brindley
filled
a
pipe
and
lit
it
as
he
walked
the
way
in
which
that
man
kept
the
match
alight
in
a
fresh
breeze
made
me
envious
i
could
conceive
myself
rivalling
his
exploits
in
the
purchase
of
rare
books
the
interpretation
of
music
even
for
a
wager
the
drinking
of
beer
but
i
knew
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
keep
a
match
alight
in
a
breeze
he
threw
the
match
into
the
mud
and
in
the
mud
it
continued
miraculously
to
burn
with
a
large
flame
as
though
still
under
his
magic
dominion
there
are
some
things
that
baffle
the
reasoning
faculty
i
said
must
have
been
a
pretty
woman
once
pretty
by
god
he
replied
was
beautiful
she
was
considered
the
finest
piece
in
hanbridge
at
one
time
and
let
me
tell
you
supposed
to
have
more
than
our
share
of
good
looks
in
the
five
towns
the
women
you
mean
she
never
married
anything
no
he
said
carelessly
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
she
never
i
was
just
going
to
exclaim
but
i
did
not
i
said
it
her
sister
who
is
mrs
colclough
he
seemed
to
be
either
meditative
or
disinclined
to
talk
however
my
friends
have
sometimes
hinted
to
me
that
when
my
curiosity
is
really
aroused
i
am
capable
of
indiscretions
one
sister
rattles
about
in
an
expensive
and
the
other
serves
behind
a
bar
i
observed
he
glanced
at
me
expect
it
a
bit
difficult
for
you
to
understand
he
answered
you
must
remember
you
in
a
democratic
district
you
told
me
once
you
knew
exeter
well
this
is
a
cathedral
town
it
about
a
century
in
front
of
any
cathedral
town
in
the
world
why
my
good
sir
there
practically
no
such
thing
as
class
distinction
here
both
my
grandfathers
were
working
potters
colclough
father
was
a
joiner
who
finished
up
as
a
builder
if
colclough
makes
money
and
chooses
to
go
to
paris
and
get
the
best
he
can
why
in
hades
should
his
wife
ride
in
it
if
he
is
fond
of
music
and
can
play
like
the
devil
that
is
his
fault
is
it
his
wife
was
a
dressmaker
at
least
she
was
a
dressmaker
assistant
if
she
suits
him
what
the
matter
i
never
suggested
me
he
stopped
me
speaking
with
careful
and
slightly
exaggerated
calmness
think
you
did
if
the
difference
in
the
situations
of
the
two
sisters
did
strike
you
as
very
extraordinary
what
did
you
mean
is
it
extraordinary
i
demanded
would
be
considered
so
in
any
reasonable
society
he
insisted
fact
is
my
good
sir
you
have
yet
quite
got
rid
of
exeter
i
do
believe
this
place
will
do
you
good
why
damn
it
colclough
marry
both
sisters
you
think
he
might
keep
the
other
sister
well
he
might
but
suppose
his
wife
had
sisters
should
he
keep
them
all
i
can
tell
you
we
just
like
the
rest
of
the
world
we
find
no
difficulty
whatever
in
spending
all
the
money
we
make
i
dare
say
colclough
would
be
ready
enough
to
keep
his
i
never
asked
him
but
i
perfectly
certain
that
his
would
be
kept
not
much
you
do
know
these
women
down
here
my
good
sir
she
earned
her
living
at
one
thing
or
another
all
her
life
and
i
reckon
she
keep
on
earning
it
till
she
drops
she
is
without
exception
the
most
exasperating
female
i
ever
came
across
and
saying
something
but
i
will
give
her
that
credit
she
mighty
independent
exasperating
i
asked
surprised
to
hear
this
from
him
do
know
but
she
is
if
she
was
my
wife
i
should
kill
her
one
night
do
you
know
what
i
mean
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
said
you
seemed
to
be
awfully
good
friends
with
her
use
being
anything
else
no
woman
that
it
ever
pleased
providence
to
construct
is
going
to
frighten
me
away
from
the
draught
burton
that
you
can
get
at
the
tiger
besides
she
ca
help
it
she
was
born
like
that
talks
quite
ordinarily
i
remarked
it
is
what
she
says
particularly
it
her
either
you
like
her
or
you
do
like
her
now
colclough
thinks
she
all
right
in
fact
he
admires
her
one
thing
i
said
jolly
nearly
cried
tonight
mechanical
said
mr
brindley
with
cruel
curtness
what
seemed
to
me
singular
was
that
the
relations
which
had
existed
between
miss
annie
brett
and
simon
fuge
appeared
to
have
no
interest
whatever
for
mr
brindley
he
had
not
even
referred
to
them
were
just
beginning
to
draw
her
out
i
ventured
he
replied
thought
i
just
see
what
she
say
no
one
ever
did
draw
that
woman
out
i
had
completely
lost
my
vision
of
her
in
the
boat
but
somehow
that
declaration
of
his
one
ever
did
draw
that
woman
out
partially
restored
the
vision
to
me
it
seemed
to
invest
her
with
agreeable
mystery
the
other
sister
mrs
colclough
i
questioned
taking
you
to
see
her
as
fast
as
i
can
he
answered
his
tone
implied
further
just
humoured
one
of
your
whims
now
for
the
other
tell
me
something
about
her
the
best
woman
that
is
in
bursley
but
she
will
only
play
every
other
night
for
fear
the
habit
should
get
hold
of
her
there
you
got
her
than
miss
brett
said
mr
brindley
is
the
same
sort
of
person
is
she
is
not
said
mr
brindley
and
his
tone
implied
god
for
it
very
soon
afterwards
at
the
top
of
a
hill
he
drew
me
into
the
garden
of
a
large
house
which
stood
back
from
the
road
vii
it
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
house
from
mr
brindley
one
felt
that
immediately
on
entering
the
hall
which
was
extensive
there
was
far
more
money
and
considerably
less
taste
at
large
in
that
house
than
in
the
other
i
noticed
carved
furniture
that
must
have
been
bought
with
a
coarse
and
a
generous
hand
and
on
the
walls
a
diptych
by
marcus
stone
portraying
the
course
of
true
love
clingingly
draped
it
was
just
like
exeter
or
onslow
square
but
the
servant
who
received
us
struck
at
once
the
same
note
as
had
sounded
so
agreeably
at
mr
brindley
she
seemed
positively
glad
to
see
us
our
arrival
seemed
to
afford
her
a
peculiar
and
violent
pleasure
as
though
the
hospitality
which
we
were
about
to
accept
was
in
some
degree
hers
too
she
robbed
us
of
our
hats
with
ecstasy
then
mr
colclough
appeared
you
come
mr
loring
he
said
shaking
my
hand
again
he
said
it
with
fervour
he
obviously
was
delighted
the
exercise
of
hospitality
was
clearly
the
chief
joy
of
his
life
at
least
if
he
had
a
greater
it
must
have
been
something
where
keenness
was
excessive
beyond
the
point
of
pleasure
as
some
joys
are
do
bob
your
missis
has
just
come
he
was
still
in
his
motoring
clothes
mr
brindley
observing
my
gaze
transiently
on
the
marcus
stones
said
know
what
you
looking
for
you
looking
for
saul
awakening
we
do
keep
it
in
the
window
you
see
it
inside
always
rotting
me
about
my
pictures
mr
colclough
smiled
indulgently
he
seemed
big
enough
to
eat
his
friend
and
his
rich
heavy
voice
rolled
like
thunder
about
the
hall
along
in
will
you
ol
mr
brindley
called
in
a
conspiratorial
tone
and
turning
to
me
tell
him
the
limerick
you
know
one
about
the
hayrick
mr
brindley
nodded
there
were
three
heads
close
together
for
a
space
of
twenty
seconds
or
so
and
then
a
fearful
explosion
happened
the
unique
tremendous
laughter
of
mr
colclough
which
went
off
like
a
charge
of
melinite
and
staggered
the
furniture
now
a
feminine
voice
protested
from
an
unseen
interior
i
was
taken
to
the
an
immense
apartment
with
an
immense
piano
black
as
midnight
in
it
at
the
further
end
two
women
were
seated
close
together
in
conversation
and
i
distinctly
heard
the
name
one
of
them
was
mrs
brindley
in
a
hat
the
other
a
very
big
and
stout
woman
in
an
elaborate
crimson
garment
that
resembled
a
teagown
rose
and
came
to
meet
me
with
extended
hand
wife
mr
loring
said
mr
oliver
colclough
glad
to
meet
you
she
said
beaming
on
me
with
all
her
pleasure
and
sit
between
mrs
brindley
and
me
near
the
window
and
keep
us
in
order
do
you
find
it
very
close
there
are
at
least
a
hundred
cats
in
the
garden
one
instantly
perceived
that
ceremonial
stiffness
could
not
exist
in
the
same
atmosphere
with
mrs
oliver
colclough
during
the
whole
time
i
spent
in
her
house
there
was
never
the
slightest
pause
in
the
conversation
mrs
oliver
colclough
prevented
nobody
from
talking
but
she
would
gladly
use
up
every
odd
remnant
of
time
that
was
not
employed
by
others
no
scrap
was
too
small
for
her
this
is
the
other
one
i
said
to
myself
give
me
this
one
certainly
there
was
a
resemblance
between
the
two
in
the
general
formation
of
the
face
and
the
shape
of
the
shoulders
but
it
is
astonishing
that
two
sisters
can
differ
as
these
did
with
a
profound
and
vital
difference
in
mrs
colclough
there
was
no
coquetterie
no
trace
of
that
challenge
to
a
man
that
one
feels
always
in
the
type
to
which
her
sister
belonged
the
notorious
battle
of
the
sexes
was
assuredly
carried
on
by
her
in
a
spirit
of
frank
muscular
gaiety
she
could
i
am
sure
do
her
share
of
fighting
put
her
in
a
boat
on
the
bosom
of
the
lake
under
starlight
and
she
would
not
by
a
gesture
a
tone
a
glance
convey
mysterious
nothings
to
you
a
male
she
would
not
be
subtly
changed
by
the
sensuous
influences
of
the
situation
she
would
always
be
the
same
plump
and
earthly
piece
of
candour
even
if
she
were
in
love
with
you
she
would
not
convey
mysterious
nothings
in
such
circumstances
if
she
were
in
love
with
you
she
would
most
clearly
convey
unmysterious
and
solid
somethings
i
was
convinced
that
the
contributing
cause
to
the
presence
of
the
late
simon
fuge
in
the
boat
on
ilam
lake
on
the
historic
night
was
annie
the
superior
barmaid
and
not
sally
of
the
automobile
but
mrs
colclough
if
not
beautiful
was
a
very
agreeable
creation
her
amplitude
gave
at
first
sight
an
exaggerated
impression
of
her
age
but
this
departed
after
more
careful
inspection
she
could
not
have
been
more
than
thirty
she
was
very
dark
with
plenteous
and
untidy
black
hair
thick
eyebrows
and
a
slight
moustache
her
eyes
were
very
vivacious
and
her
gestures
despite
that
bulk
quick
and
graceful
she
was
happy
her
ideals
were
satisfied
it
was
probably
happiness
that
had
made
her
stout
her
massiveness
was
apparently
no
grief
to
her
she
had
fallen
into
the
carelessness
which
is
too
often
the
pitfall
of
women
who
being
stout
are
content
do
missis
mr
brindley
greeted
her
and
to
his
wife
do
missis
but
look
here
bright
star
this
gadding
about
is
all
very
well
but
what
about
those
precious
kids
of
yours
none
of
dead
yet
i
hope
be
silly
bob
been
over
to
your
house
mrs
colclough
put
in
course
it
is
mumps
the
child
as
right
as
rain
so
i
brought
mary
back
with
me
said
mr
brindley
a
woman
who
never
had
any
children
your
knowledge
of
children
beggars
description
what
you
are
sure
you
know
about
them
is
knowledge
however
mrs
colclough
replied
with
a
delightful
throwingdown
of
the
glove
bet
you
a
level
sovereign
that
child
has
got
the
mumps
so
there
and
oliver
will
guarantee
to
pay
you
said
mr
colclough
back
my
wife
any
day
bet
bob
mrs
brindley
enjoined
her
husband
excitedly
in
her
high
treble
wo
said
mr
brindley
let
sit
down
mrs
colclough
addressed
me
with
particular
confidential
grace
we
three
exactly
filled
the
sofa
i
have
often
sat
between
two
women
but
never
with
such
calm
unreserved
unapprehensive
comfortableness
as
i
experienced
between
mrs
colclough
and
mrs
brindley
it
was
just
as
if
i
had
known
them
for
years
make
a
mess
of
that
ol
said
mr
brindley
the
other
two
men
were
at
some
distance
in
front
of
a
table
on
which
were
two
champagne
bottles
and
five
glasses
and
a
plate
of
cakes
i
said
to
myself
not
going
to
have
any
champagne
anyhow
mercurey
green
chartreuse
irish
whisky
and
then
champagne
and
a
morning
hard
work
tomorrow
no
plop
a
cork
flew
up
and
bounced
against
the
ceiling
mr
colclough
carefully
emptied
the
bottle
into
the
glasses
of
which
mr
brindley
seized
two
and
advanced
with
one
in
either
hand
for
the
women
it
was
the
host
who
offered
a
glass
to
me
thanks
very
much
i
really
ca
i
said
in
a
very
firm
tone
my
tone
was
so
firm
that
it
startled
them
they
glanced
at
each
other
with
alarmed
eyes
like
simple
people
confronted
by
an
inexplicable
phenomenon
look
here
mister
said
mr
colclough
pained
got
this
out
specially
for
you
you
do
suppose
this
is
our
usual
tipple
do
you
i
yielded
i
could
do
no
less
than
sacrifice
myself
to
their
enchanting
instinctive
kindness
of
heart
shall
be
dead
tomorrow
i
said
to
myself
i
shall
have
lived
tonight
they
were
relieved
but
i
saw
that
i
had
given
them
a
shock
from
which
they
could
not
instantaneously
recover
therefore
i
began
with
a
long
pull
to
reassure
them
brindley
has
been
telling
me
that
simon
fuge
is
dead
said
mrs
colclough
brightly
as
though
mrs
brindley
had
been
telling
her
that
the
price
of
mutton
had
gone
down
i
perceived
that
those
two
had
been
talking
over
simon
fuge
after
their
fashion
yes
i
responded
you
got
that
newspaper
in
your
pocket
mr
loring
asked
mrs
brindley
i
had
i
said
feeling
in
my
pockets
must
have
left
it
at
your
house
she
said
strange
i
looked
for
it
to
show
it
to
mrs
colclough
but
i
could
see
it
this
was
not
surprising
i
did
not
want
mrs
colclough
to
read
the
journalistic
obituary
until
she
had
given
me
her
own
obituary
of
fuge
must
be
somewhere
about
i
said
and
to
mrs
colclough
suppose
you
knew
him
pretty
well
bless
you
no
i
only
met
him
once
ilam
what
are
you
going
to
do
oliver
her
husband
was
opening
the
piano
and
i
are
just
going
to
have
another
smack
at
that
brahms
do
expect
us
to
listen
do
you
expect
you
to
do
what
pleases
you
missis
said
he
should
be
a
bigger
fool
than
i
am
if
i
expected
anything
else
then
he
smiled
at
me
just
go
on
talking
ol
and
i
drown
you
easy
enough
quite
short
back
in
five
minutes
the
two
men
placed
each
his
on
the
space
on
the
piano
designed
for
a
candlestick
lighted
cigars
and
sat
down
to
play
mrs
colclough
resumed
in
a
lower
more
confidential
tone
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music
see
there
was
a
whole
party
of
us
there
and
mr
fuge
was
staying
at
the
hotel
and
of
course
he
knew
several
of
us
he
took
you
out
in
a
boat
and
annie
yes
just
as
it
was
getting
dusk
he
came
up
to
us
and
asked
us
if
we
go
for
a
row
eh
i
can
hear
him
asking
us
now
i
asked
him
if
he
could
row
and
he
was
quite
angry
so
we
went
to
quieten
him
she
paused
and
then
laughed
mrs
brindley
protested
know
he
dead
she
admitted
the
rightness
of
the
protest
i
ca
help
it
i
was
just
thinking
how
he
got
his
feet
wet
in
pushing
the
boat
off
she
laughed
again
we
were
safely
off
someone
came
down
to
the
shore
and
shouted
to
mr
fuge
to
bring
the
boat
back
you
know
his
quick
way
of
talking
here
she
began
to
imitate
fuge
i
quarrelled
with
the
man
this
boat
belongs
to
awful
feud
fact
is
i
in
a
hostile
country
here
and
a
lot
more
like
that
it
seemed
he
had
quarrelled
with
everybody
in
ilam
he
was
sure
if
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
would
let
him
sleep
there
again
he
told
us
all
about
all
his
quarrels
until
he
dropped
one
of
the
oars
i
shall
never
forget
how
funny
he
looked
in
the
moonlight
when
he
dropped
the
oar
there
that
your
fault
he
said
you
make
me
talk
too
much
about
myself
and
i
get
excited
he
kept
striking
matches
to
look
for
the
oar
and
turning
the
boat
round
and
round
with
the
other
oar
last
match
he
said
we
shall
never
see
land
tonight
then
he
found
the
oar
again
he
considered
we
were
saved
then
he
began
to
tell
us
about
his
aunt
you
know
i
no
business
to
be
here
i
came
down
from
london
for
my
aunt
funeral
and
here
i
am
in
a
boat
at
night
with
two
pretty
girls
he
said
the
funeral
had
taught
him
one
thing
and
that
was
that
black
neckties
were
the
only
possible
sort
of
necktie
he
said
the
greatest
worry
of
his
life
had
always
been
neckties
but
he
have
to
worry
any
more
and
so
his
aunt
had
died
for
nothing
i
assure
you
he
kept
on
talking
about
neckties
i
assure
you
mr
loring
i
went
to
sleep
at
least
i
dozed
and
when
i
woke
up
he
was
still
talking
about
neckties
but
then
his
feet
began
to
get
cold
i
suppose
it
was
because
they
were
wet
the
way
he
grumbled
about
his
feet
being
cold
i
remember
he
turned
his
coat
collar
up
he
wanted
to
get
on
shore
and
walk
but
he
taken
us
a
long
way
up
the
lake
by
that
time
and
he
saw
we
were
absolutely
lost
so
he
put
the
oars
in
the
boat
and
stood
up
and
stamped
his
feet
it
might
have
upset
the
boat
did
it
end
i
inquired
annie
and
i
caught
the
train
but
only
just
you
see
it
was
a
special
train
so
they
kept
it
for
us
otherwise
we
should
have
been
in
a
nice
fix
you
have
special
trains
in
these
parts
of
course
it
was
the
annual
outing
of
the
teachers
of
st
sunday
school
and
their
friends
you
see
so
we
had
a
special
train
at
this
point
the
duettists
came
to
the
end
of
a
movement
and
mr
brindley
leaned
over
to
us
from
his
stool
glass
in
hand
railway
company
practically
owns
ilam
he
explained
so
they
run
it
for
all
they
worth
they
made
the
lake
to
feed
the
canals
when
they
bought
the
canals
from
the
canal
company
it
an
artificial
lake
and
the
railway
runs
alongside
it
a
very
good
scheme
of
the
company
they
started
out
to
make
ilam
a
popular
resort
and
made
it
a
popular
resort
what
with
special
trains
and
things
but
try
to
get
a
special
train
to
any
other
place
on
their
rotten
system
and
you
soon
see
big
is
the
lake
i
asked
long
is
it
ol
he
demanded
of
colclough
couple
of
miles
it
about
a
mile
adagio
they
proceeded
with
brahms
ran
with
you
all
the
way
to
the
station
did
he
mrs
brindley
suggested
to
mrs
colclough
should
just
say
he
did
mrs
colclough
concurred
wanted
to
get
warm
and
then
he
was
awfully
afraid
lest
we
should
miss
it
thought
you
were
on
the
lake
practically
all
night
i
exclaimed
night
well
i
do
know
what
you
call
all
night
but
i
was
back
in
bursley
before
eleven
i
sure
i
then
contrived
to
discover
the
gazette
in
an
unsearched
pocket
and
i
gave
it
to
mrs
colclough
to
read
mrs
brindley
looked
over
her
shoulder
there
was
no
slightest
movement
of
depreciation
on
mrs
part
she
amiably
smiled
as
she
perused
the
gazette
version
of
version
of
the
lake
episode
here
was
the
attitude
of
the
woman
whose
soul
is
like
crystal
it
seems
to
me
that
most
women
would
have
blushed
or
dissented
or
simulated
anger
or
failed
to
conceal
vanity
but
mrs
coclough
might
have
been
reading
a
fairy
tale
for
any
emotion
she
displayed
she
said
blandly
the
things
annie
used
to
tell
me
about
him
sometimes
i
should
say
that
was
just
how
he
would
talk
they
seem
to
have
thought
quite
a
lot
of
him
in
london
then
rather
i
said
suppose
your
sister
knew
him
pretty
well
i
do
know
she
knew
him
i
distinctly
observed
a
certain
in
mrs
colclough
as
she
made
this
reply
mrs
brindley
had
risen
and
with
wifely
attentiveness
was
turning
over
the
music
page
for
her
husband
viii
soon
afterwards
for
me
the
night
began
to
grow
fantastic
it
took
on
the
colour
of
a
gigantic
adventure
i
do
not
suppose
that
either
mr
brindley
or
mr
colclough
or
the
other
person
who
presently
arrived
regarded
it
as
anything
but
a
pleasant
conviviality
but
to
a
man
of
my
constitution
and
habits
it
was
an
almost
incredible
occurrence
the
other
person
was
the
doctor
he
arrived
with
a
discreet
tap
on
the
window
at
midnight
to
spend
the
evening
mrs
brindley
had
gone
home
and
mrs
colclough
had
gone
to
bed
the
doctor
refused
champagne
he
was
in
fact
very
rude
to
champagne
in
general
he
had
whisky
and
those
astonishing
individuals
messieurs
brindley
and
colclough
secretly
convinced
of
the
justice
of
the
attack
on
champagne
had
whisky
too
and
that
still
most
astonishing
individual
loring
of
the
joined
them
it
was
the
hour
of
limericks
limericks
were
demanded
for
the
diversion
of
the
doctor
and
i
furnished
them
we
then
listened
to
the
tale
of
the
experiences
that
day
amid
the
sturdy
population
of
a
muling
village
not
far
from
bursley
seldom
have
i
had
such
a
bath
in
the
pure
fluid
of
human
nature
all
sense
of
time
was
lost
i
lived
in
an
eternity
i
could
not
suggest
to
my
host
that
we
should
depart
i
could
however
decline
more
whisky
and
i
could
given
the
chance
discourse
with
gay
despair
concerning
the
miserable
wreck
that
i
should
be
on
the
morrow
in
consequence
of
this
high
living
i
asked
them
how
i
could
be
expected
in
such
a
state
to
judge
delicate
points
of
expertise
in
earthenware
i
gave
them
a
brief
sketch
of
my
customary
evening
and
left
them
to
compare
it
with
that
evening
the
doctor
perceived
that
i
was
serious
he
gazed
at
me
with
pity
as
if
to
say
frail
southern
organism
it
ought
to
be
in
bed
with
nothing
inside
it
but
tea
what
he
did
actually
say
was
come
round
to
my
place
i
soon
put
you
right
you
stop
me
from
having
a
headache
tomorrow
i
eagerly
asked
think
so
he
said
with
calm
northern
confidence
at
some
later
hour
mr
brindley
and
i
round
mr
colclough
would
not
come
he
bade
me
as
his
wife
had
done
with
the
most
extraordinary
kindness
the
most
genuine
sorrow
at
quitting
me
the
most
genuine
pleasure
in
the
hope
of
seeing
me
again
are
three
thousand
books
in
this
room
i
said
to
myself
as
i
stood
in
the
doctor
electrically
lit
library
price
this
for
a
dog
mr
brindley
drew
my
attention
to
an
aristocratic
that
lay
on
the
hearth
titus
is
it
sleepy
well
well
how
many
firsts
has
he
won
doctor
said
the
doctor
just
fix
you
up
to
begin
with
he
turned
to
me
after
i
had
been
duly
fixed
up
help
you
to
sleep
and
placate
your
god
said
the
doctor
i
saw
to
my
intense
surprise
that
another
was
to
be
instantly
superimposed
on
the
at
mr
colclough
the
doctor
and
mr
brindley
carefully
and
deliberately
lighted
long
cigars
and
sank
deeply
into
immense
and
so
i
imitated
them
as
well
as
i
could
in
my
feeble
southern
way
we
talked
books
we
just
simply
enumerated
books
without
end
praising
or
damning
them
and
arranged
authors
in
neat
pews
like
cattle
in
classes
at
an
agricultural
show
no
pastime
is
more
agreeable
to
people
who
have
the
book
disease
and
none
more
quickly
fleets
the
hours
and
none
is
more
delightfully
futile
ages
elapsed
and
suddenly
like
a
gun
discharging
mr
brindley
said
must
go
of
all
things
that
happened
this
was
the
most
astonishing
we
did
go
the
way
said
mr
brindley
in
the
doctor
wide
porch
forgot
to
tell
you
that
simon
fuge
is
dead
he
said
the
doctor
you
got
a
couple
of
his
etchings
have
you
said
the
doctor
had
but
i
sold
them
several
months
ago
said
mr
brindley
negligently
did
know
well
so
long
we
had
a
few
hundred
yards
to
walk
down
the
silent
wide
street
where
the
were
burning
with
the
strange
endless
patience
that
have
the
stillness
of
a
provincial
town
at
night
is
quite
different
from
that
of
london
we
might
have
been
the
only
persons
alive
in
england
except
for
a
feeling
of
unreality
a
feeling
that
the
natural
order
of
things
had
been
disturbed
by
some
necromancer
i
was
perfectly
well
the
same
morning
at
breakfast
as
the
doctor
had
predicted
i
should
be
when
i
expressed
to
mr
brindley
my
stupefaction
at
this
happy
sequel
he
showed
a
polite
but
careless
inability
to
follow
my
line
of
thought
it
appeared
that
he
was
always
well
at
breakfast
even
when
he
did
stay
up
little
later
than
usual
it
appeared
further
that
he
always
breakfasted
at
a
quarter
to
nine
and
read
the
manchester
guardian
during
the
meal
to
which
his
wife
did
or
did
not
descend
according
to
the
moods
of
the
nursery
and
that
he
reached
his
office
at
a
quarter
to
ten
that
morning
the
mood
of
the
nursery
was
apparently
unpropitious
he
and
i
were
alone
i
begged
him
not
to
pretermit
his
guardian
but
to
examine
it
and
give
me
the
news
he
agreed
scarcely
unwilling
a
paragraph
in
the
london
correspondence
about
fuge
he
announced
from
behind
the
paper
do
they
say
about
him
particular
i
want
to
ask
you
something
i
said
i
had
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
the
sisters
and
simon
fuge
and
in
spite
of
everything
that
i
had
heard
in
spite
even
of
the
facts
that
the
lake
had
been
dug
by
a
railway
company
and
that
the
excursion
to
the
lake
had
been
an
excursion
of
teachers
and
their
friends
i
was
still
haunted
by
certain
notions
concerning
simon
fuge
and
annie
brett
annie
brett
flush
her
unshed
tears
and
the
shown
by
mrs
colclough
when
i
had
pointedly
mentioned
her
sister
name
in
connection
with
simon
fuge
these
were
surely
indications
and
then
the
doctor
recitals
of
manners
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
bursley
went
to
support
my
theory
that
even
in
staffordshire
life
was
very
much
life
demanded
mr
brindley
miss
brett
ever
simon
fuge
mistress
at
that
moment
mrs
brindley
miraculously
fresh
and
smiling
entered
the
room
said
mr
brindley
without
giving
her
time
to
greet
me
do
you
think
he
just
asked
me
do
know
just
asked
me
if
annie
brett
was
ever
simon
fuge
mistress
she
sank
into
a
chair
brett
she
began
to
laugh
gently
mr
loring
you
really
are
too
funny
she
yielded
to
her
emotions
it
may
be
said
that
she
laughed
as
they
can
laugh
in
the
five
towns
she
cried
she
had
to
wipe
away
the
tears
of
laughter
on
earth
made
you
think
so
she
inquired
after
recovery
had
an
idea
i
said
lamely
always
made
out
that
one
of
those
two
sisters
was
so
much
to
him
and
i
knew
it
could
be
mrs
colclough
she
said
anybody
down
here
and
see
what
they
say
mr
brindley
put
in
go
about
asking
you
might
get
yourself
disliked
but
you
may
take
it
it
is
true
certainly
his
wife
concurred
with
seriousness
reckon
to
know
something
about
simon
fuge
down
here
mr
brindley
added
about
the
famous
annie
must
have
flirted
with
her
a
good
bit
anyhow
i
said
flirt
ejaculated
mr
brindley
i
had
a
sudden
dazzling
vision
of
the
great
truth
that
the
people
of
the
five
towns
have
no
particular
use
for
in
any
department
of
life
so
i
accepted
the
final
judgement
with
meekness
ix
i
returned
to
london
that
evening
my
work
done
and
the
municipality
happily
flattered
by
my
judgement
of
the
dishes
mr
brindley
had
found
time
to
meet
me
at
the
midday
meal
and
he
had
left
his
office
earlier
than
usual
in
order
to
help
me
to
drink
his
afternoon
tea
about
an
hour
later
he
picked
up
my
little
bag
and
said
that
he
should
accompany
me
to
the
little
station
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
of
cinders
and
broken
crockery
and
even
see
me
as
far
as
knype
where
i
had
to
take
the
london
express
no
there
are
no
in
the
five
towns
mrs
brindley
stood
on
her
doorstep
with
her
eldest
infant
on
her
shoulders
and
waved
us
off
the
infant
cried
expressing
his
own
and
his
mother
grief
at
losing
a
guest
it
seems
as
if
people
are
born
hospitable
in
the
five
towns
we
had
not
walked
more
than
a
hundred
yards
up
the
road
when
a
thundered
down
upon
us
from
the
opposite
direction
it
was
mr
colclough
and
mr
colclough
was
driving
it
mr
brindley
stopped
his
friend
with
the
authoritative
gesture
of
a
policeman
are
you
going
ol
lad
sorry
you
leaving
us
so
soon
mr
loring
mistaken
my
boy
said
mr
brindley
just
going
to
run
us
down
to
knype
station
first
must
look
slippy
then
said
mr
colclough
can
look
as
slippy
as
you
like
said
mr
brindley
in
another
fifteen
seconds
we
were
in
the
car
and
it
had
turned
round
and
was
speeding
towards
knype
a
feverish
journey
we
passed
electric
cars
every
minute
and
for
three
miles
were
continually
twisting
round
the
tails
of
ponderous
creaking
and
excessively
deliberate
carts
that
dropped
a
trail
of
small
coal
or
huge
barrels
on
wheels
that
dripped
something
like
the
finest
devonshire
cream
or
brewer
drays
that
left
nothing
behind
them
save
a
luscious
odour
of
malt
it
was
a
breathless
slither
over
unctuous
black
mud
through
a
long
winding
canon
of
houses
and
shops
with
a
glimpse
here
and
there
of
a
park
a
canal
or
a
football
field
dared
hurry
said
mr
colclough
setting
us
down
at
the
station
was
afraid
of
a
skid
he
had
not
spoken
during
the
transit
put
on
side
ol
said
mr
brindley
time
did
you
get
up
this
morning
lad
i
was
at
th
works
at
nine
he
flew
off
to
escape
my
thanks
and
mr
brindley
and
i
went
into
the
station
owing
to
the
celerity
of
the
automobile
we
had
to
wait
we
spent
it
chiefly
at
the
bookstall
while
we
were
there
the
edition
of
the
staffordshire
signal
affectionately
termed
local
rag
by
its
readers
arrived
and
we
watched
a
newsboy
affix
its
poster
to
a
board
the
poster
ran
thus
hanbridge
rates
lively
meeting
knype
new
centre
forward
all
winners
and
now
close
by
this
poster
was
the
poster
of
the
daily
telegraph
and
among
the
items
offered
by
the
daily
telegraph
was
of
simon
fuge
i
could
not
forbear
pointing
out
to
mr
brindley
the
difference
between
the
two
posters
a
conversation
ensued
and
amid
the
rumbling
of
trains
and
the
rough
stir
of
the
platform
we
got
back
again
to
simon
fuge
and
mr
brindley
tone
gradually
grew
if
not
acrid
a
little
impatient
all
he
said
are
rates
especially
in
hanbridge
and
let
me
tell
you
that
last
season
knype
football
club
jolly
nearly
got
thrown
out
of
the
first
league
the
constitution
of
the
team
for
this
next
season
why
damn
it
it
a
question
of
national
importance
you
do
understand
these
things
if
knype
football
club
was
put
into
the
league
second
division
ten
thousand
homes
would
go
into
mourning
who
the
devil
was
simon
fuge
they
joke
with
such
extraordinary
seriousness
in
the
five
towns
that
one
is
somehow
bound
to
pretend
that
they
are
not
joking
so
i
replied
was
a
great
artist
and
this
is
his
native
district
surely
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
him
may
have
been
a
great
artist
said
mr
brindley
he
may
not
but
for
us
he
was
simply
a
man
who
came
of
a
family
that
had
a
bad
reputation
for
talking
too
much
and
acting
the
goat
i
said
we
shall
see
in
fifty
years
just
what
we
sha
said
he
shall
be
where
simon
fuge
is
dead
however
perhaps
we
are
proud
of
him
but
you
do
expect
us
to
show
it
do
you
that
not
our
style
he
performed
the
phenomenon
with
his
eyes
it
was
his
final
exhibition
of
it
to
me
strange
place
i
reflected
as
i
ate
my
dinner
in
the
with
the
pressure
of
mr
brindley
steely
clasp
still
affecting
my
right
hand
and
the
rich
honest
cordiality
of
his
au
revoir
in
my
heart
place
that
is
passing
strange
and
i
thought
further
he
may
have
been
a
boaster
and
a
chatterer
and
a
man
who
suffered
from
cold
feet
at
the
wrong
moments
and
the
five
towns
may
have
got
the
better
of
him
now
but
that
portrait
of
the
little
girl
in
the
wedgwood
institution
is
waiting
there
right
in
the
middle
of
the
five
towns
and
one
day
the
five
towns
will
have
to
it
best
they
can
say
what
they
like
what
eyes
the
fellow
had
when
he
was
in
the
right
company
in
a
new
bottle
commercial
travellers
are
rather
like
bees
they
take
the
seed
of
a
good
story
from
one
district
and
deposit
it
in
another
thus
several
localities
imperfectly
righteous
have
within
recent
years
appropriated
this
story
to
their
own
annals
i
once
met
an
old
herbalist
from
of
all
places
in
beautiful
england
who
positively
asserted
that
the
episode
occurred
just
outside
the
london
and
main
line
station
at
wigan
this
old
herbalist
was
no
judge
of
the
value
of
evidence
an
undertaker
from
hull
told
me
flatly
little
knowing
who
i
was
and
where
i
came
from
that
he
was
the
undertaker
concerned
in
the
episode
this
undertaker
was
a
liar
i
use
this
term
because
there
is
no
other
word
in
the
language
which
accurately
expresses
my
meaning
of
persons
who
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
over
from
the
united
states
in
order
to
inform
me
that
the
affair
happened
at
harper
ferry
poughkeepsie
syracuse
allegheny
indianapolis
columbus
charlotte
tabernacle
alliance
wheeling
lynchburg
and
chicago
it
would
be
unbecoming
to
speak
they
are
best
left
to
silence
themselves
by
mutual
recrimination
the
fact
is
that
the
authentic
scene
of
the
affair
was
a
railway
carriage
belonging
to
the
north
staffordshire
railway
company
and
rolling
on
that
company
between
longshaw
and
hanbridge
the
undertaker
is
now
dead
it
is
a
disturbing
truth
that
even
undertakers
die
sometimes
and
since
his
widow
has
given
me
permission
to
mention
his
name
i
shall
mention
his
name
it
was
edward
till
of
course
everybody
in
the
five
towns
knows
who
the
undertaker
was
and
if
anybody
in
the
five
towns
should
ever
chance
to
come
across
this
book
i
offer
him
my
excuses
for
having
brought
coals
to
newcastle
mr
till
used
to
be
a
fairly
figure
in
hanbridge
which
is
the
centre
of
undertaking
as
it
is
of
everything
else
in
the
five
towns
he
was
in
a
small
but
a
successful
way
of
business
had
one
leg
a
trifle
shorter
than
the
other
which
slightly
deteriorated
the
majesty
of
his
demeanour
on
solemn
occasions
played
the
fiddle
kept
rabbits
and
was
of
a
forgetful
disposition
it
was
possibly
this
forgetful
disposition
which
had
prevented
him
from
rising
into
a
large
way
of
business
all
admired
his
personal
character
and
tempered
geniality
but
there
are
some
things
that
will
not
bear
forgetting
however
the
story
touches
but
lightly
that
side
of
his
individuality
one
morning
mr
till
had
to
go
to
longshaw
to
fetch
a
baby
coffin
which
had
been
ordered
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
a
certain
baby
was
dead
this
baby
i
may
mention
was
the
hero
of
the
celebrated
scare
of
longshaw
about
the
danger
of
being
buried
alive
the
little
thing
had
apparently
passed
away
and
what
is
more
an
inquest
had
been
held
on
it
and
its
parents
had
been
censured
by
the
jury
for
criminal
carelessness
in
overlaying
it
and
it
was
within
five
minutes
of
being
nailed
up
when
it
opened
its
eyes
you
may
imagine
the
enormous
sensation
that
there
was
in
the
five
towns
one
doctor
lost
his
reputation
naturally
he
emigrated
to
the
continent
and
now
practising
at
lucerne
in
the
summer
and
mentone
in
the
winter
charges
fifteen
shillings
a
visit
instead
of
three
and
six
at
longshaw
for
informing
people
who
have
nothing
the
matter
with
them
that
they
must
take
care
of
themselves
the
parents
of
the
astonished
baby
moved
the
heaven
and
earth
of
the
five
towns
to
force
the
coroner
to
withdraw
the
stigma
of
the
jury
censure
but
they
did
not
succeed
not
even
with
the
impassioned
aid
of
two
london
halfpenny
dailies
to
resume
mr
till
had
to
go
to
longshaw
now
unless
you
possess
a
most
minute
knowledge
of
your
native
country
you
are
probably
not
aware
that
in
aynsley
street
longshaw
there
is
a
provision
dealer
whose
reputation
for
cheeses
would
be
national
and
supreme
if
the
whole
of
england
thought
as
the
five
towns
thinks
mrs
till
said
as
mr
till
was
starting
might
as
well
bring
back
with
you
a
pound
of
gorgonzola
be
it
noted
that
i
had
the
details
of
the
conversation
from
the
lady
herself
said
he
enthusiastically
will
go
and
forget
it
she
enjoined
him
he
said
tie
a
knot
in
my
handkerchief
lot
of
good
that
do
she
observed
tied
a
knot
in
your
handkerchief
when
you
forgot
that
councillor
barker
wife
funeral
was
altered
from
tuesday
to
monday
he
replied
now
i
got
a
bad
cold
you
have
she
agreed
reassured
he
tied
the
knot
in
his
handkerchief
and
went
thanks
to
his
cold
he
did
not
pass
the
cheesemonger
without
entering
he
adored
gorgonzola
and
he
reckoned
that
he
knew
a
bit
of
good
gorgonzola
when
he
met
with
it
moreover
he
and
the
cheesemonger
were
old
friends
he
having
buried
three
of
the
cheesemonger
children
he
emerged
from
the
cheesemonger
with
a
pound
of
the
perfectest
gorgonzola
that
ever
greeted
the
senses
the
abode
of
the
censured
parents
was
close
by
and
also
close
to
the
station
he
obtained
the
coffin
without
parley
and
told
the
mother
who
showed
him
the
remarkable
child
with
pride
that
under
the
circumstances
he
should
make
no
charge
at
all
it
was
a
ridiculously
small
coffin
he
was
quite
accustomed
to
coffins
hence
he
did
the
natural
thing
he
tucked
the
little
coffin
under
one
arm
and
dangling
the
cheese
neat
in
brown
paper
and
string
from
the
other
hand
he
hastened
to
the
station
with
his
unmatched
legs
he
must
have
made
a
somewhat
noticeable
figure
a
train
was
waiting
and
he
got
into
it
put
the
cheese
on
the
rack
in
a
corner
and
the
coffin
next
to
it
assured
himself
that
he
had
not
mislaid
his
return
ticket
and
sat
down
under
his
baggage
it
was
the
slackest
time
of
day
and
as
the
train
started
at
longshaw
there
were
very
few
passengers
he
had
the
compartment
to
himself
he
was
just
giving
way
to
one
of
those
moods
of
vague
and
pleasant
meditation
which
are
perhaps
the
chief
joy
of
such
a
temperament
when
he
suddenly
sprang
up
as
if
in
fear
and
fear
had
in
fact
seized
him
suppose
he
forgot
those
belongings
on
the
rack
suppose
sublimely
careless
he
descended
from
the
train
and
left
them
there
what
a
calamity
and
similar
misadventures
had
happened
to
him
before
it
was
the
cheese
that
disquieted
him
no
one
would
be
sufficiently
unprincipled
to
steal
the
coffin
and
he
would
ultimately
recover
it
at
the
lost
luggage
office
babies
coffins
not
abounding
on
the
north
staffordshire
railway
but
the
cheese
he
would
never
see
the
cheese
again
no
integrity
would
be
able
to
withstand
the
blandishments
of
that
cheese
moreover
his
wife
would
be
saddened
and
for
her
he
had
a
sincere
and
profound
affection
his
act
of
precaution
was
to
lift
the
coffin
down
from
the
rack
and
place
it
on
the
seat
beside
him
and
then
to
put
the
parcel
of
cheese
on
the
coffin
he
surveyed
the
cheese
on
the
coffin
he
surveyed
it
with
the
critical
and
experienced
eye
of
an
undertaker
and
he
decided
that
if
anyone
else
got
into
the
carriage
it
would
not
look
quite
decent
quite
becoming
in
a
word
quite
nice
a
coffin
is
a
coffin
and
people
feelings
have
to
be
considered
so
he
whipped
off
the
lid
of
the
coffin
stuck
the
cheese
inside
and
popped
the
lid
on
again
and
he
kept
his
hand
on
the
coffin
that
he
might
not
forget
it
when
the
train
halted
at
knype
mr
till
was
glad
that
he
had
put
the
cheese
inside
for
another
passenger
got
into
the
compartment
and
it
was
a
clergyman
he
recognized
the
clergyman
though
the
clergyman
did
not
recognize
him
it
was
the
reverend
claud
ffolliott
famous
throughout
the
five
towns
as
the
man
who
begins
his
name
with
a
small
letter
does
smoke
of
course
does
drink
but
goes
to
football
matches
has
an
average
of
eighteen
at
cricket
and
makes
a
very
pretty
show
with
the
gloves
in
spite
of
his
years
celibate
very
high
very
natty
and
learned
about
vestments
terrific
at
sick
couches
and
funerals
mr
till
inwardly
trembled
to
think
what
the
reverend
claud
ffolliott
might
have
said
had
he
seen
the
cheese
reposing
in
the
coffin
though
the
coffin
was
empty
the
parson
whose
mind
was
apparently
occupied
dropped
into
the
nearest
corner
which
chanced
to
be
the
corner
farthest
away
from
mr
till
he
then
instantly
opened
a
copy
of
the
church
times
and
began
to
read
it
and
the
train
went
forward
the
parson
sniffed
absently
as
if
he
had
been
dozing
and
a
fly
had
tickled
his
nose
shortly
afterwards
he
sniffed
again
but
without
looking
up
from
his
perusals
he
sniffed
a
third
time
and
glanced
over
the
top
edge
of
the
church
times
at
mr
till
calmed
by
the
innocuous
aspect
of
mr
till
he
bent
once
more
to
the
paper
but
after
an
interval
he
was
sniffing
furiously
he
glanced
at
the
window
it
was
open
finally
he
lowered
the
church
times
as
who
should
say
am
a
man
but
really
this
phenomenon
which
assaults
my
nostrils
must
be
seriously
inquired
into
then
it
was
that
he
caught
sight
of
the
coffin
with
mr
till
hand
caressing
it
and
mr
till
all
in
black
and
carrying
a
funereal
expression
he
straightened
himself
pulled
himself
together
on
account
of
his
cloth
and
said
to
mr
till
in
his
most
majestic
and
sympathetic
graveside
voice
my
dear
friend
i
see
that
you
have
suffered
a
sad
sad
bereavement
that
rich
resonant
voice
was
positively
thrilling
when
it
addressed
hopeless
grief
mr
till
did
not
know
what
to
say
nor
where
to
look
have
however
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
very
thankful
for
said
the
parson
after
a
pause
may
be
sure
the
poor
thing
is
not
in
a
trance
