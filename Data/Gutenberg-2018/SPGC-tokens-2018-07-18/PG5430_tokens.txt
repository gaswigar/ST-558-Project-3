preface
to
a
dictionary
of
the
english
language
by
samuel
johnson
it
is
the
fate
of
those
who
toil
at
the
lower
employments
of
life
to
be
rather
driven
by
the
fear
of
evil
than
attracted
by
the
prospect
of
good
to
be
exposed
to
censure
without
hope
of
praise
to
be
disgraced
by
miscarriage
or
punished
for
neglect
where
success
would
have
been
without
applause
and
diligence
without
reward
among
these
unhappy
mortals
is
the
writer
of
dictionaries
whom
mankind
have
considered
not
as
the
pupil
but
the
slave
of
science
the
pionier
of
literature
doomed
only
to
remove
rubbish
and
clear
obstructions
from
the
paths
through
which
learning
and
genius
press
forward
to
conquest
and
glory
without
bestowing
a
smile
on
the
humble
drudge
that
facilitates
their
progress
every
other
authour
may
aspire
to
praise
the
lexicographer
can
only
hope
to
escape
reproach
and
even
this
negative
recompense
has
been
yet
granted
to
very
few
i
have
notwithstanding
this
discouragement
attempted
a
dictionary
of
the
english
language
which
while
it
was
employed
in
the
cultivation
of
every
species
of
literature
has
itself
been
hitherto
neglected
suffered
to
spread
under
the
direction
of
chance
into
wild
exuberance
resigned
to
the
tyranny
of
time
and
fashion
and
exposed
to
the
corruptions
of
ignorance
and
caprices
of
innovation
when
i
took
the
first
survey
of
my
undertaking
i
found
our
speech
copious
without
order
and
energetick
without
rules
wherever
i
turned
my
view
there
was
perplexity
to
be
disentangled
and
confusion
to
be
regulated
choice
was
to
be
made
out
of
boundless
variety
without
any
established
principle
of
selection
adulterations
were
to
be
detected
without
a
settled
test
of
purity
and
modes
of
expression
to
be
rejected
or
received
without
the
suffrages
of
any
writers
of
classical
reputation
or
acknowledged
authority
having
therefore
no
assistance
but
from
general
grammar
i
applied
myself
to
the
perusal
of
our
writers
and
noting
whatever
might
be
of
use
to
ascertain
or
illustrate
any
word
or
phrase
accumulated
in
time
the
materials
of
a
dictionary
which
by
degrees
i
reduced
to
method
establishing
to
myself
in
the
progress
of
the
work
such
rules
as
experience
and
analogy
suggested
to
me
experience
which
practice
and
observation
were
continually
increasing
and
analogy
which
though
in
some
words
obscure
was
evident
in
others
in
adjusting
the
orthography
which
has
been
to
this
time
unsettled
and
fortuitous
i
found
it
necessary
to
distinguish
those
irregularities
that
are
inherent
in
our
tongue
and
perhaps
coeval
with
it
from
others
which
the
ignorance
or
negligence
of
later
writers
has
produced
every
language
has
its
anomalies
which
though
inconvenient
and
in
themselves
once
unnecessary
must
be
tolerated
among
the
imperfections
of
human
things
and
which
require
only
to
be
registered
that
they
may
not
be
increased
and
ascertained
that
they
may
not
be
confounded
but
every
language
has
likewise
its
improprieties
and
absurdities
which
it
is
the
duty
of
the
lexicographer
to
correct
or
proscribe
as
language
was
at
its
beginning
merely
oral
all
words
of
necessary
or
common
use
were
spoken
before
they
were
written
and
while
they
were
unfixed
by
any
visible
signs
must
have
been
spoken
with
great
diversity
as
we
now
observe
those
who
can
not
read
catch
sounds
imperfectly
and
utter
them
negligently
when
this
wild
and
barbarous
jargon
was
first
reduced
to
an
alphabet
every
penman
endeavoured
to
express
as
he
could
the
sounds
which
he
was
accustomed
to
pronounce
or
to
receive
and
vitiated
in
writing
such
words
as
were
already
vitiated
in
speech
the
powers
of
the
letters
when
they
were
applied
to
a
new
language
must
have
been
vague
and
unsettled
and
therefore
different
hands
would
exhibit
the
same
sound
by
different
combinations
from
this
uncertain
pronunciation
arise
in
a
great
part
the
various
dialects
of
the
same
country
which
will
always
be
observed
to
grow
fewer
and
less
different
as
books
are
multiplied
and
from
this
arbitrary
representation
of
sounds
by
letters
proceeds
that
diversity
of
spelling
observable
in
the
saxon
remains
and
i
suppose
in
the
first
books
of
every
nation
which
perplexes
or
destroys
analogy
and
produces
anomalous
formations
that
being
once
incorporated
can
never
be
afterward
dismissed
or
reformed
of
this
kind
are
the
derivatives
length
from
long
strength
from
strong
darling
from
dear
breadth
from
broad
from
dry
drought
and
from
high
height
which
milton
in
zeal
for
analogy
writes
highth
quid
te
exempta
juvat
spinis
de
pluribus
una
horace
epistles
ii
ii
to
change
all
would
be
too
much
and
to
change
one
is
nothing
this
uncertainty
is
most
frequent
in
the
vowels
which
are
so
capriciously
pronounced
and
so
differently
modified
by
accident
or
affectation
not
only
in
every
province
but
in
every
mouth
that
to
them
as
is
well
known
to
etymologists
little
regard
is
to
be
shewn
in
the
deduction
of
one
language
from
another
such
defects
are
not
errours
in
orthography
but
spots
of
barbarity
impressed
so
deep
in
the
english
language
that
criticism
can
never
wash
them
away
these
therefore
must
be
permitted
to
remain
untouched
but
many
words
have
likewise
been
altered
by
accident
or
depraved
by
ignorance
as
the
pronunciation
of
the
vulgar
has
been
weakly
followed
and
some
still
continue
to
be
variously
written
as
authours
differ
in
their
care
or
skill
of
these
it
was
proper
to
enquire
the
true
orthography
which
i
have
always
considered
as
depending
on
their
derivation
and
have
therefore
referred
them
to
their
original
languages
thus
i
write
enchant
enchantment
enchanter
after
the
french
and
incantation
after
the
latin
thus
entire
is
chosen
rather
than
intire
because
it
passed
to
us
not
from
the
latin
integer
but
from
the
french
entier
of
many
words
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
they
were
immediately
received
from
the
latin
or
the
french
since
at
the
time
when
we
had
dominions
in
france
we
had
latin
service
in
our
churches
it
is
however
my
opinion
that
the
french
generally
supplied
us
for
we
have
few
latin
words
among
the
terms
of
domestick
use
which
are
not
french
but
many
french
which
are
very
remote
from
latin
even
in
words
of
which
the
derivation
is
apparent
i
have
been
often
obliged
to
sacrifice
uniformity
to
custom
thus
i
write
in
compliance
with
a
numberless
majority
convey
and
inveigh
deceit
and
receipt
fancy
and
phantom
sometimes
the
derivative
varies
from
the
primitive
as
explain
and
explanation
repeat
and
repetition
some
combinations
of
letters
having
the
same
power
are
used
indifferently
without
any
discoverable
reason
of
choice
as
in
choak
choke
soap
sope
jewel
fuel
and
many
others
which
i
have
sometimes
inserted
twice
that
those
who
search
for
them
under
either
form
may
not
search
in
vain
in
examining
the
orthography
of
any
doubtful
word
the
mode
of
spelling
by
which
it
is
inserted
in
the
series
of
the
dictionary
is
to
be
considered
as
that
to
which
i
give
perhaps
not
often
rashly
the
preference
i
have
left
in
the
examples
to
every
authour
his
own
practice
unmolested
that
the
reader
may
balance
suffrages
and
judge
between
us
but
this
question
is
not
always
to
be
determined
by
reputed
or
by
real
learning
some
men
intent
upon
greater
things
have
thought
little
on
sounds
and
derivations
some
knowing
in
the
ancient
tongues
have
neglected
those
in
which
our
words
are
commonly
to
be
sought
thus
hammond
writes
fecibleness
for
feasibleness
because
i
suppose
he
imagined
it
derived
immediately
from
the
latin
and
some
words
such
as
dependant
dependent
dependance
dependence
vary
their
final
syllable
as
one
or
another
language
is
present
to
the
writer
in
this
part
of
the
work
where
caprice
has
long
wantoned
without
controul
and
vanity
sought
praise
by
petty
reformation
i
have
endeavoured
to
proceed
with
a
scholar
reverence
for
antiquity
and
a
grammarian
regard
to
the
genius
of
our
tongue
i
have
attempted
few
alterations
and
among
those
few
perhaps
the
greater
part
is
from
the
modern
to
the
ancient
practice
and
i
hope
i
may
be
allowed
to
recommend
to
those
whose
thoughts
have
been
perhaps
employed
too
anxiously
on
verbal
singularities
not
to
disturb
upon
narrow
views
or
for
minute
propriety
the
orthography
of
their
fathers
it
has
been
asserted
that
for
the
law
to
be
known
is
of
more
importance
than
to
be
right
change
says
hooker
is
not
made
without
inconvenience
even
from
worse
to
better
there
is
in
constancy
and
stability
a
general
and
lasting
advantage
which
will
always
overbalance
the
slow
improvements
of
gradual
correction
much
less
ought
our
written
language
to
comply
with
the
corruptions
of
oral
utterance
or
copy
that
which
every
variation
of
time
or
place
makes
different
from
itself
and
imitate
those
changes
which
will
again
be
changed
while
imitation
is
employed
in
observing
them
this
recommendation
of
steadiness
and
uniformity
does
not
proceed
from
an
opinion
that
particular
combinations
of
letters
have
much
influence
on
human
happiness
or
that
truth
may
not
be
successfully
taught
by
modes
of
spelling
fanciful
and
erroneous
i
am
not
yet
so
lost
in
lexicography
as
to
i
forget
that
words
are
the
daughters
of
earth
and
that
things
are
the
sons
of
heaven
language
is
only
the
instrument
of
science
and
words
are
but
the
signs
of
ideas
i
wish
however
that
the
instrument
might
be
less
apt
to
decay
and
that
signs
might
be
permanent
like
the
things
which
they
denote
in
settling
the
orthography
i
have
not
wholly
neglected
the
pronunciation
which
i
have
directed
by
printing
an
accent
upon
the
acute
or
elevated
syllable
it
will
sometimes
be
found
that
the
accent
is
placed
by
the
authour
quoted
on
a
different
syllable
from
that
marked
in
the
alphabetical
series
it
is
then
to
be
understood
that
custom
has
varied
or
that
the
authour
has
in
my
opinion
pronounced
wrong
short
directions
are
sometimes
given
where
the
sound
of
letters
is
irregular
and
if
they
are
sometimes
omitted
defect
in
such
minute
observations
will
be
more
easily
excused
than
superfluity
in
the
investigation
both
of
the
orthography
and
signification
of
words
their
etymology
was
necessarily
to
be
considered
and
they
were
therefore
to
be
divided
into
primitives
and
derivatives
a
primitive
word
is
that
which
can
be
traced
no
further
to
any
english
root
thus
circumspect
circumvent
circumstance
delude
concave
and
complicate
though
compounds
in
the
latin
are
to
us
primitives
derivatives
are
all
those
that
can
be
referred
to
any
word
in
english
of
greater
simplicity
the
derivatives
i
have
referred
to
their
primitives
with
an
accuracy
sometimes
needless
for
who
does
not
see
that
remoteness
comes
from
remote
lovely
from
love
concavity
from
concave
and
demonstrative
from
demonstrate
but
this
grammatical
exuberance
the
scheme
of
my
work
did
not
allow
me
to
repress
it
is
of
great
importance
in
examining
the
general
fabrick
of
a
language
to
trace
one
word
from
another
by
noting
the
usual
modes
of
derivation
and
inflection
and
uniformity
must
be
preserved
in
systematical
works
though
sometimes
at
the
expence
of
particular
propriety
among
other
derivatives
i
have
been
careful
to
insert
and
elucidate
the
anomalous
plurals
of
nouns
and
preterites
of
verbs
which
in
the
teutonick
dialects
are
very
frequent
and
though
familiar
to
those
who
have
always
used
them
interrupt
and
embarrass
the
learners
of
our
language
the
two
languages
from
which
our
primitives
have
been
derived
are
the
roman
and
teutonick
under
the
roman
i
comprehend
the
french
and
provincial
tongues
and
under
the
teutonick
range
the
saxon
german
and
all
their
kindred
dialects
most
of
our
polysyllables
are
roman
and
our
words
of
one
syllable
are
very
often
teutonick
in
assigning
the
roman
original
it
has
perhaps
sometimes
happened
that
i
have
mentioned
only
the
latin
when
the
word
was
borrowed
from
the
french
and
considering
myself
as
employed
only
in
the
illustration
of
my
own
language
i
have
not
been
very
careful
to
observe
whether
the
latin
word
be
pure
or
barbarous
or
the
french
elegant
or
obsolete
for
the
teutonick
etymologies
i
am
commonly
indebted
to
junius
and
skinner
the
only
names
which
i
have
forborn
to
quote
when
i
copied
their
books
not
that
i
might
appropriate
their
labours
or
usurp
their
honours
but
that
i
might
spare
a
perpetual
repetition
by
one
general
acknowledgment
of
these
whom
i
ought
not
to
mention
but
with
the
reverence
due
to
instructors
and
benefactors
junius
appears
to
have
excelled
in
extent
of
learning
and
skinner
in
rectitude
of
understanding
junius
was
accurately
skilled
in
all
the
northern
languages
skinner
probably
examined
the
ancient
and
remoter
dialects
only
by
occasional
inspection
into
dictionaries
but
the
learning
of
junius
is
often
of
no
other
use
than
to
show
him
a
track
by
which
he
may
deviate
from
his
purpose
to
which
skinner
always
presses
forward
by
the
shortest
way
skinner
is
often
ignorant
but
never
ridiculous
junius
is
always
full
of
knowledge
but
his
variety
distracts
his
judgment
and
his
learning
is
very
frequently
disgraced
by
his
absurdities
the
votaries
of
the
northern
muses
will
not
perhaps
easily
restrain
their
indignation
when
they
find
the
name
of
junius
thus
degraded
by
a
disadvantageous
comparison
but
whatever
reverence
is
due
to
his
diligence
or
his
attainments
it
can
be
no
criminal
degree
of
censoriousness
to
charge
that
etymologist
with
want
of
judgment
who
can
seriously
derive
dream
from
drama
because
life
is
a
drama
and
a
drama
is
a
dream
and
who
declares
with
a
tone
of
defiance
that
no
man
can
fail
to
derive
moan
from
in
greek
monos
single
or
solitary
who
considers
that
grief
naturally
loves
to
be
alone
footnote
that
i
may
not
appear
to
have
spoken
too
irreverently
of
junius
i
have

our
knowledge
of
the
northern
literature
is
so
scanty
that
of
words
undoubtedly
teutonick
the
original
is
not
always
to
be
found
in
any
ancient
language
and
i
have
therefore
inserted
dutch
or
german
substitutes
which
i
consider
not
as
radical
but
parallel
not
as
the
parents
but
sisters
of
the
english
the
words
which
are
represented
as
thus
related
by
descent
or
cognation
do
not
always
agree
in
sense
for
it
is
incident
to
words
as
to
their
authours
to
degenerate
from
their
ancestors
and
to
change
their
manners
when
they
change
their
country
it
is
sufficient
in
etymological
enquiries
if
the
senses
of
kindred
words
be
found
such
as
may
easily
pass
into
each
other
or
such
as
may
both
be
referred
to
one
general
idea
the
etymology
so
far
as
it
is
yet
known
was
easily
found
in
the
volumes
where
it
is
particularly
and
professedly
delivered
and
by
proper
attention
to
the
rules
of
derivation
the
orthography
was
soon
adjusted
but
to
collect
the
words
of
our
language
was
a
task
of
greater
difficulty
the
deficiency
of
dictionaries
was
immediately
apparent
and
when
they
were
exhausted
what
was
yet
wanting
must
be
sought
by
fortuitous
and
unguided
excursions
into
books
and
gleaned
as
industry
should
find
or
chance
should
offer
it
in
the
boundless
chaos
of
a
living
speech
my
search
however
has
been
either
skilful
or
lucky
for
i
have
much
augmented
the
vocabulary
as
my
design
was
a
dictionary
common
or
appellative
i
have
omitted
all
words
which
have
relation
to
proper
names
such
as
arian
socinian
calvinist
benedictine
mahometan
but
have
retained
those
of
a
more
general
nature
as
heathen
pagan
of
the
terms
of
art
i
have
received
such
as
could
be
found
either
in
books
of
science
or
technical
dictionaries
and
have
often
inserted
from
philosophical
writers
words
which
are
supported
perhaps
only
by
a
single
authority
and
which
being
not
admitted
into
general
use
stand
yet
as
candidates
or
probationers
and
must
depend
for
their
adoption
on
the
suffrage
of
futurity
the
words
which
our
authours
have
introduced
by
their
knowledge
of
foreign
languages
or
ignorance
of
their
own
by
vanity
or
wantonness
by
compliance
with
fashion
or
lust
of
innovation
i
have
registred
as
they
occurred
though
commonly
only
to
censure
them
and
warn
others
against
the
folly
of
naturalizing
useless
foreigners
to
the
injury
of
the
natives
i
have
not
rejected
any
by
design
merely
because
they
were
unnecessary
or
exuberant
but
have
received
those
which
by
different
writers
have
been
differently
formed
as
viscid
and
viscidity
viscous
and
viscosity
compounded
or
double
words
i
have
seldom
noted
except
when
they
obtain
a
signification
different
from
that
which
the
components
have
in
their
simple
state
thus
highwayman
woodman
and
horsecourser
require
an
explanation
but
of
thieflike
or
coachdriver
no
notice
was
needed
because
the
primitives
contain
the
meaning
of
the
compounds
words
arbitrarily
formed
by
a
constant
and
settled
analogy
like
diminutive
adjectives
in
ish
as
greenish
bluish
adverbs
in
ly
as
dully
openly
substantives
in
ness
as
vileness
faultiness
were
less
diligently
sought
and
sometimes
have
been
omitted
when
i
had
no
authority
that
invited
me
to
insert
them
not
that
they
are
not
genuine
and
regular
offsprings
of
english
roots
but
because
their
relation
to
the
primitive
being
always
the
same
their
signification
can
not
be
mistaken
the
verbal
nouns
in
ing
such
as
the
keeping
of
the
castle
the
leading
of
the
army
are
always
neglected
or
placed
only
to
illustrate
the
sense
of
the
verb
except
when
they
signify
things
as
well
as
actions
and
have
therefore
a
plural
number
as
dwelling
living
or
have
an
absolute
and
abstract
signification
as
colouring
painting
learning
the
participles
are
likewise
omitted
unless
by
signifying
rather
habit
or
quality
than
action
they
take
the
nature
of
adjectives
as
a
thinking
man
a
man
of
prudence
a
pacing
horse
a
horse
that
can
pace
these
i
have
ventured
to
call
participial
adjectives
but
neither
are
these
always
inserted
because
they
are
commonly
to
be
understood
without
any
danger
of
mistake
by
consulting
the
verb
obsolete
words
are
admitted
when
they
are
found
in
authours
not
obsolete
or
when
they
have
any
force
or
beauty
that
may
deserve
revival
as
composition
is
one
of
the
chief
characteristicks
of
a
language
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
some
reparation
for
the
universal
negligence
of
my
predecessors
by
inserting
great
numbers
of
compounded
words
as
may
be
found
under
after
fore
new
night
fair
and
many
more
these
numerous
as
they
are
might
be
multiplied
but
that
use
and
curiosity
are
here
satisfied
and
the
frame
of
our
language
and
modes
of
our
combination
amply
discovered
of
some
forms
of
composition
such
as
that
by
which
re
is
prefixed
to
note
repetition
and
un
to
signify
contrariety
or
privation
all
the
examples
can
not
be
accumulated
because
the
use
of
these
particles
if
not
wholly
arbitrary
is
so
little
limited
that
they
are
hourly
affixed
to
new
words
as
occasion
requires
or
is
imagined
to
require
them
there
is
another
kind
of
composition
more
frequent
in
our
language
than
perhaps
in
any
other
from
which
arises
to
foreigners
the
greatest
difficulty
we
modify
the
signification
of
many
verbs
by
a
particle
subjoined
as
to
come
off
to
escape
by
a
fetch
to
fall
on
to
attack
to
fall
off
to
apostatize
to
break
off
to
stop
abruptly
to
bear
out
to
justify
to
fall
in
to
comply
to
give
over
to
cease
to
set
off
to
embellish
to
set
in
to
begin
a
continual
tenour
to
set
out
to
begin
a
course
or
journey
to
take
off
to
copy
with
innumerable
expressions
of
the
same
kind
of
which
some
appear
wildly
irregular
being
so
far
distant
from
the
sense
of
the
simple
words
that
no
sagacity
will
be
able
to
trace
the
steps
by
which
they
arrived
at
the
present
use
these
i
have
noted
with
great
care
and
though
i
can
not
flatter
myself
that
the
collection
is
complete
i
believe
i
have
so
far
assisted
the
students
of
our
language
that
this
kind
of
phraseology
will
be
no
longer
insuperable
and
the
combinations
of
verbs
and
particles
by
chance
omitted
will
be
easily
explained
by
comparison
with
those
that
may
be
found
many
words
yet
stand
supported
only
by
the
name
of
bailey
ainsworth
philips
or
the
contracted
dict
for
dictionaries
subjoined
of
these
i
am
not
always
certain
that
they
are
read
in
any
book
but
the
works
of
lexicographers
of
such
i
have
omitted
many
because
i
had
never
read
them
and
many
i
have
inserted
because
they
may
perhaps
exist
though
they
have
escaped
my
notice
they
are
however
to
be
yet
considered
as
resting
only
upon
the
credit
of
former
dictionaries
others
which
i
considered
as
useful
or
know
to
be
proper
though
i
could
not
at
present
support
them
by
authorities
i
have
suffered
to
stand
upon
my
own
attestation
claiming
the
same
privilege
with
my
predecessors
of
being
sometimes
credited
without
proof
the
words
thus
selected
and
disposed
are
grammatically
considered
they
are
referred
to
the
different
parts
of
speech
traced
when
they
are
irregularly
inflected
through
their
various
terminations
and
illustrated
by
observations
not
indeed
of
great
or
striking
importance
separately
considered
but
necessary
to
the
elucidation
of
our
language
and
hitherto
neglected
or
forgotten
by
english
grammarians
that
part
of
my
work
on
which
i
expect
malignity
most
frequently
to
fasten
is
the
explanation
in
which
i
can
not
hope
to
satisfy
those
who
are
perhaps
not
inclined
to
be
pleased
since
i
have
not
always
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
to
interpret
a
language
by
itself
is
very
difficult
many
words
can
not
be
explained
by
synonimes
because
the
idea
signified
by
them
has
not
more
than
one
appellation
nor
by
paraphrase
because
simple
ideas
can
not
be
described
when
the
nature
of
things
is
unknown
or
the
notion
unsettled
and
indefinite
and
various
in
various
minds
the
words
by
which
such
notions
are
conveyed
or
such
things
denoted
will
be
ambiguous
and
perplexed
and
such
is
the
fate
of
hapless
lexicography
that
not
only
darkness
but
light
impedes
and
distresses
it
things
may
be
not
only
too
little
but
too
much
known
to
be
happily
illustrated
to
explain
requires
the
use
of
terms
less
abstruse
than
that
which
is
to
be
explained
and
such
terms
can
not
always
be
found
for
as
nothing
can
be
proved
but
by
supposing
something
intuitively
known
and
evident
without
proof
so
nothing
can
be
defined
but
by
the
use
of
words
too
plain
to
admit
a
definition
other
words
there
are
of
which
the
sense
is
too
subtle
and
evanescent
to
be
fixed
in
a
paraphrase
such
are
all
those
which
are
by
the
grammarians
termed
expletives
and
in
dead
languages
are
suffered
to
pass
for
empty
sounds
of
no
other
use
than
to
fill
a
verse
or
to
modulate
a
period
but
which
are
easily
perceived
in
living
tongues
to
have
power
and
emphasis
though
it
be
sometimes
such
as
no
other
form
of
expression
can
convey
my
labour
has
likewise
been
much
increased
by
a
class
of
verbs
too
frequent
in
the
english
language
of
which
the
signification
is
so
loose
and
general
the
use
so
vague
and
indeterminate
and
the
senses
detorted
so
widely
from
the
first
idea
that
it
is
hard
to
trace
them
through
the
maze
of
variation
to
catch
them
on
the
brink
of
utter
inanity
to
circumscribe
them
by
any
limitations
or
interpret
them
by
any
words
of
distinct
and
settled
meaning
such
are
bear
break
come
cast
full
get
give
do
put
set
go
run
make
take
turn
throw
if
of
these
the
whole
power
is
not
accurately
delivered
it
must
be
remembered
that
while
our
language
is
yet
living
and
variable
by
the
caprice
of
every
one
that
speaks
it
these
words
are
hourly
shifting
their
relations
and
can
no
more
be
ascertained
in
a
dictionary
than
a
grove
in
the
agitation
of
a
storm
can
be
accurately
delineated
from
its
picture
in
the
water
the
particles
are
among
all
nations
applied
with
so
great
latitude
that
they
are
not
easily
reducible
under
any
regular
scheme
of
explication
this
difficulty
is
not
less
nor
perhaps
greater
in
english
than
in
other
languages
i
have
laboured
them
with
diligence
i
hope
with
success
such
at
least
as
can
be
expected
in
a
task
which
no
man
however
learned
or
sagacious
has
yet
been
able
to
perform
some
words
there
are
which
i
can
not
explain
because
i
do
not
understand
them
these
might
have
been
omitted
very
often
with
little
inconvenience
but
i
would
not
so
far
indulge
my
vanity
as
to
decline
this
confession
for
when
tully
owns
himself
ignorant
whether
lessus
in
the
twelve
tables
means
a
funeral
song
or
mourning
garment
and
aristotle
doubts
whether
word
in
greek
in
the
iliad
signifies
a
mule
or
muleteer
i
may
surely
without
shame
leave
some
obscurities
to
happier
industry
or
future
information
the
rigour
of
interpretative
lexicography
requires
that
the
explanation
and
the
word
explained
should
always
be
reciprocal
this
i
have
always
endeavoured
but
could
not
always
attain
words
are
seldom
exactly
synonimous
a
new
term
was
not
introduced
but
because
the
former
was
thought
inadequate
names
therefore
have
often
many
ideas
but
few
ideas
have
many
names
it
was
then
necessary
to
use
the
proximate
word
for
the
deficiency
of
single
terms
can
very
seldom
be
supplied
by
circumlocution
nor
is
the
inconvenience
great
of
such
mutilated
interpretations
because
the
sense
may
easily
be
collected
entire
from
the
examples
in
every
word
of
extensive
use
it
was
requisite
to
mark
the
progress
of
its
meaning
and
show
by
what
gradations
of
intermediate
sense
it
has
passed
from
its
primitive
to
its
remote
and
accidental
signification
so
that
every
foregoing
explanation
should
tend
to
that
which
follows
and
the
series
be
regularly
concatenated
from
the
first
notion
to
the
last
this
is
specious
but
not
always
practicable
kindred
senses
may
be
so
interwoven
that
the
perplexity
can
not
be
disentangled
nor
any
reason
be
assigned
why
one
should
be
ranged
before
the
other
when
the
radical
idea
branches
out
into
parallel
ramifications
how
can
a
consecutive
series
be
formed
of
senses
in
their
nature
collateral
the
shades
of
meaning
sometimes
pass
imperceptibly
into
each
other
so
that
though
on
one
side
they
apparently
differ
yet
it
is
impossible
to
mark
the
point
of
contact
ideas
of
the
same
race
though
not
exactly
alike
are
sometimes
so
little
different
that
no
words
can
express
the
dissimilitude
though
the
mind
easily
perceives
it
when
they
are
exhibited
together
and
sometimes
there
is
such
a
confusion
of
acceptations
that
discernment
is
wearied
and
distinction
puzzled
and
perseverance
herself
hurries
to
an
end
by
crouding
together
what
she
can
not
separate
these
complaints
of
difficulty
will
by
those
that
have
never
considered
words
beyond
their
popular
use
be
thought
only
the
jargon
of
a
man
willing
to
magnify
his
labours
and
procure
veneration
to
his
studies
by
involution
and
obscurity
but
every
art
is
obscure
to
those
that
have
not
learned
it
this
uncertainty
of
terms
and
commixture
of
ideas
is
well
known
to
those
who
have
joined
philosophy
with
grammar
and
if
i
have
not
expressed
them
very
clearly
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
am
speaking
of
that
which
words
are
insufficient
to
explain
the
original
sense
of
words
is
often
driven
out
of
use
by
their
metaphorical
acceptations
yet
must
be
inserted
for
the
sake
of
a
regular
origination
thus
i
know
not
whether
ardour
is
used
for
material
heat
or
whether
flagrant
in
english
ever
signifies
the
same
with
burning
yet
such
are
the
primitive
ideas
of
these
words
which
are
therefore
set
first
though
without
examples
that
the
figurative
senses
may
be
commodiously
deduced
such
is
the
exuberance
of
signification
which
many
words
have
obtained
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
collect
all
their
senses
sometimes
the
meaning
of
derivatives
must
be
sought
in
the
mother
term
and
sometimes
deficient
explanations
of
the
primitive
may
be
supplied
in
the
train
of
derivation
in
any
case
of
doubt
or
difficulty
it
will
be
always
proper
to
examine
all
the
words
of
the
same
race
for
some
words
are
slightly
passed
over
to
avoid
repetition
some
admitted
easier
and
clearer
explanation
than
others
and
all
will
be
better
understood
as
they
are
considered
in
greater
variety
of
structures
and
relations
all
the
interpretations
of
words
are
not
written
with
the
same
skill
or
the
same
happiness
things
equally
easy
in
themselves
are
not
all
equally
easy
to
any
single
mind
every
writer
of
a
long
work
commits
errours
where
there
appears
neither
ambiguity
to
mislead
nor
obscurity
to
confound
him
and
in
a
search
like
this
many
felicities
of
expression
will
be
casually
overlooked
many
convenient
parallels
will
be
forgotten
and
many
particulars
will
admit
improvement
from
a
mind
utterly
unequal
to
the
whole
performance
but
many
seeming
faults
are
to
be
imputed
rather
to
the
nature
of
the
undertaking
than
the
negligence
of
the
performer
thus
some
explanations
are
unavoidably
reciprocal
or
circular
as
hind
the
female
of
the
stag
stag
the
male
of
the
hind
sometimes
easier
words
are
changed
into
harder
as
burial
into
sepulture
or
interment
drier
into
desiccative
dryness
into
siccity
or
aridity
fit
into
paroxysm
for
the
easiest
word
whatever
it
be
can
never
be
translated
into
one
more
easy
but
easiness
and
difficulty
are
merely
relative
and
if
the
present
prevalence
of
our
language
should
invite
foreigners
to
this
dictionary
many
will
be
assisted
by
those
words
which
now
seem
only
to
increase
or
produce
obscurity
for
this
reason
i
have
endeavoured
frequently
to
join
a
teutonick
and
roman
interpretation
as
to
cheer
to
gladden
or
exhilarate
that
every
learner
of
english
may
be
assisted
by
his
own
tongue
the
solution
of
all
difficulties
and
the
supply
of
all
defects
must
be
sought
in
the
examples
subjoined
to
the
various
senses
of
each
word
and
ranged
according
to
the
time
of
their
authours
when
first
i
collected
these
authorities
i
was
desirous
that
every
quotation
should
be
useful
to
some
other
end
than
the
illustration
of
a
word
i
therefore
extracted
from
philosophers
principles
of
science
from
historians
remarkable
facts
from
chymists
complete
processes
from
divines
striking
exhortations
and
from
poets
beautiful
descriptions
such
is
design
while
it
is
yet
at
a
distance
from
execution
when
the
time
called
upon
me
to
range
this
accumulation
of
elegance
and
wisdom
into
an
alphabetical
series
i
soon
discovered
that
the
bulk
of
my
volumes
would
fright
away
the
student
and
was
forced
to
depart
from
my
scheme
of
including
all
that
was
pleasing
or
useful
in
english
literature
and
reduce
my
transcripts
very
often
to
clusters
of
words
in
which
scarcely
any
meaning
is
retained
thus
to
the
weariness
of
copying
i
was
condemned
to
add
the
vexation
of
expunging
some
passages
i
have
yet
spared
which
may
relieve
the
labour
of
verbal
searches
and
intersperse
with
verdure
and
flowers
the
dusty
desarts
of
barren
philology
the
examples
thus
mutilated
are
no
longer
to
be
considered
as
conveying
the
sentiments
or
doctrine
of
their
authours
the
word
for
the
sake
of
which
they
are
inserted
with
all
its
appendant
clauses
has
been
carefully
preserved
but
it
may
sometimes
happen
by
hasty
detruncation
that
the
general
tendency
of
the
sentence
may
be
changed
the
divine
may
desert
his
tenets
or
the
philosopher
his
system
some
of
the
examples
have
been
taken
from
writers
who
were
never
mentioned
as
masters
of
elegance
or
models
of
stile
but
words
must
be
sought
where
they
are
used
and
in
what
pages
eminent
for
purity
can
terms
of
manufacture
or
agriculture
be
found
many
quotations
serve
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
proving
the
bare
existence
of
words
and
are
therefore
selected
with
less
scrupulousness
than
those
which
are
to
teach
their
structures
and
relations
my
purpose
was
to
admit
no
testimony
of
living
authours
that
i
might
not
be
misled
by
partiality
and
that
none
of
my
cotemporaries
might
have
reason
to
complain
nor
have
i
departed
from
this
resolution
but
when
some
performance
of
uncommon
excellence
excited
my
veneration
when
my
memory
supplied
me
from
late
books
with
an
example
that
was
wanting
or
when
my
heart
in
the
tenderness
of
friendship
solicited
admission
for
a
favourite
name
so
far
have
i
been
from
any
care
to
grace
my
pages
with
modern
decorations
that
i
have
studiously
endeavoured
to
collect
examples
and
authorities
from
the
writers
before
the
restoration
whose
works
i
regard
as
the
wells
of
english
undefiled
as
the
pure
sources
of
genuine
diction
our
language
for
almost
a
century
has
by
the
concurrence
of
many
causes
been
gradually
departing
from
its
original
teutonick
character
and
deviating
towards
a
gallick
structure
and
phraseology
from
which
it
ought
to
be
our
endeavour
to
recal
it
by
making
our
ancient
volumes
the
of
stile
admitting
among
the
additions
of
later
times
only
such
as
may
supply
real
deficiencies
such
as
are
readily
adopted
by
the
genius
of
our
tongue
and
incorporate
easily
with
our
native
idioms
but
as
every
language
has
a
time
of
rudeness
antecedent
to
perfection
as
well
as
of
false
refinement
and
declension
i
have
been
cautious
lest
my
zeal
for
antiquity
might
drive
me
into
times
too
remote
and
croud
my
book
with
words
now
no
longer
understood
i
have
fixed
sidney
work
for
the
boundary
beyond
which
i
make
few
excursions
from
the
authours
which
rose
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
a
speech
might
be
formed
adequate
to
all
the
purposes
of
use
and
elegance
if
the
language
of
theology
were
extracted
from
hooker
and
the
translation
of
the
bible
the
terms
of
natural
knowledge
from
bacon
the
phrases
of
policy
war
and
navigation
from
raleigh
the
dialect
of
poetry
and
fiction
from
spenser
and
sidney
and
the
diction
of
common
life
from
shakespeare
few
ideas
would
be
lost
to
mankind
for
want
of
english
words
in
which
they
might
be
expressed
it
is
not
sufficient
that
a
word
is
found
unless
it
be
so
combined
as
that
its
meaning
is
apparently
determined
by
the
tract
and
tenour
of
the
sentence
such
passages
i
have
therefore
chosen
and
when
it
happened
that
any
authour
gave
a
definition
of
a
term
or
such
an
explanation
as
is
equivalent
to
a
definition
i
have
placed
his
authority
as
a
supplement
to
my
own
without
regard
to
the
chronological
order
that
is
otherwise
observed
some
words
indeed
stand
unsupported
by
any
authority
but
they
are
commonly
derivative
nouns
or
adverbs
formed
from
their
primitives
by
regular
and
constant
analogy
or
names
of
things
seldom
occurring
in
books
or
words
of
which
i
have
reason
to
doubt
the
existence
there
is
more
danger
of
censure
from
the
multiplicity
than
paucity
of
examples
authorities
will
sometimes
seem
to
have
been
accumulated
without
necessity
or
use
and
perhaps
some
will
be
found
which
might
without
loss
have
been
omitted
but
a
work
of
this
kind
is
not
hastily
to
be
charged
with
superfluities
those
quotations
which
to
careless
or
unskilful
perusers
appear
only
to
repeat
the
same
sense
will
often
exhibit
to
a
more
accurate
examiner
diversities
of
signification
or
at
least
afford
different
shades
of
the
same
meaning
one
will
shew
the
word
applied
to
persons
another
to
things
one
will
express
an
ill
another
a
good
and
a
third
a
neutral
sense
one
will
prove
the
expression
genuine
from
an
ancient
authour
another
will
shew
it
elegant
from
a
modern
a
doubtful
authority
is
corroborated
by
another
of
more
credit
an
ambiguous
sentence
is
ascertained
by
a
passage
clear
and
determinate
the
word
how
often
soever
repeated
appears
with
new
associates
and
in
different
combinations
and
every
quotation
contributes
something
to
the
stability
or
enlargement
of
the
language
when
words
are
used
equivocally
i
receive
them
in
either
sense
when
they
are
metaphorical
i
adopt
them
in
their
primitive
acceptation
i
have
sometimes
though
rarely
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
exhibiting
a
genealogy
of
sentiments
by
shewing
how
one
authour
copied
the
thoughts
and
diction
of
another
such
quotations
are
indeed
little
more
than
repetitions
which
might
justly
be
censured
did
they
not
gratify
the
mind
by
affording
a
kind
of
intellectual
history
the
various
syntactical
structures
occurring
in
the
examples
have
been
carefully
noted
the
licence
or
negligence
with
which
many
words
have
been
hitherto
used
has
made
our
stile
capricious
and
indeterminate
when
the
different
combinations
of
the
same
word
are
exhibited
together
the
preference
is
readily
given
to
propriety
and
i
have
often
endeavoured
to
direct
the
choice
thus
have
i
laboured
by
settling
the
orthography
displaying
the
analogy
regulating
the
structures
and
ascertaining
the
signification
of
english
words
to
perform
all
the
parts
of
a
faithful
lexicographer
but
i
have
not
always
executed
my
own
scheme
or
satisfied
my
own
expectations
the
work
whatever
proofs
of
diligence
and
attention
it
may
exhibit
is
yet
capable
of
many
improvements
the
orthography
which
i
recommend
is
still
controvertible
the
etymology
which
i
adopt
is
uncertain
and
perhaps
frequently
erroneous
the
explanations
are
sometimes
too
much
contracted
and
sometimes
too
much
diffused
the
significations
are
distinguished
rather
with
subtilty
than
skill
and
the
attention
is
harrassed
with
unnecessary
minuteness
the
examples
are
too
often
injudiciously
truncated
and
perhaps
sometimes
i
hope
very
rarely
alleged
in
a
mistaken
sense
for
in
making
this
collection
i
trusted
more
to
memory
than
in
a
state
of
disquiet
and
embarrassment
memory
can
contain
and
purposed
to
supply
at
the
review
what
was
left
incomplete
in
the
first
transcription
many
terms
appropriated
to
particular
occupations
though
necessary
and
significant
are
undoubtedly
omitted
and
of
the
words
most
studiously
considered
and
exemplified
many
senses
have
escaped
observation
yet
these
failures
however
frequent
may
admit
extenuation
and
apology
to
have
attempted
much
is
always
laudable
even
when
the
enterprize
is
above
the
strength
that
undertakes
it
to
rest
below
his
own
aim
is
incident
to
every
one
whose
fancy
is
active
and
whose
views
are
comprehensive
nor
is
any
man
satisfied
with
himself
because
he
has
done
much
but
because
he
can
conceive
little
when
first
i
engaged
in
this
work
i
resolved
to
leave
neither
words
nor
things
unexamined
and
pleased
myself
with
a
prospect
of
the
hours
which
i
should
revel
away
in
feasts
of
literature
with
the
obscure
recesses
of
northern
learning
which
i
should
enter
and
ransack
the
treasures
with
which
i
expected
every
search
into
those
neglected
mines
to
reward
my
labour
and
the
triumph
with
which
i
should
display
my
acquisitions
to
mankind
when
i
had
thus
enquired
into
the
original
of
words
i
resolved
to
show
likewise
my
attention
to
things
to
pierce
deep
into
every
science
to
enquire
the
nature
of
every
substance
of
which
i
inserted
the
name
to
limit
every
idea
by
a
definition
strictly
logical
and
exhibit
every
production
of
art
or
nature
in
an
accurate
description
that
my
book
might
be
in
place
of
all
other
dictionaries
whether
appellative
or
technical
but
these
were
the
dreams
of
a
poet
doomed
at
last
to
wake
a
lexicographer
i
soon
found
that
it
is
too
late
to
look
for
instruments
when
the
work
calls
for
execution
and
that
whatever
abilities
i
had
brought
to
my
task
with
those
i
must
finally
perform
it
to
deliberate
whenever
i
doubted
to
enquire
whenever
i
was
ignorant
would
have
protracted
the
undertaking
without
end
and
perhaps
without
much
improvement
for
i
did
not
find
by
my
first
experiments
that
that
i
had
not
of
my
own
was
easily
to
be
obtained
i
saw
that
one
enquiry
only
gave
occasion
to
another
that
book
referred
to
book
that
to
search
was
not
always
to
find
and
to
find
was
not
always
to
be
informed
and
that
thus
to
persue
perfection
was
like
the
first
inhabitants
of
arcadia
to
chace
the
sun
which
when
they
had
reached
the
hill
where
he
seemed
to
rest
was
still
beheld
at
the
same
distance
from
them
i
then
contracted
my
design
determining
to
confide
in
myself
and
no
longer
to
solicit
auxiliaries
which
produced
more
incumbrance
than
assistance
by
this
i
obtained
at
least
one
advantage
that
i
set
limits
to
my
work
which
would
in
time
be
ended
though
not
completed
despondency
has
never
so
far
prevailed
as
to
depress
me
to
negligence
some
faults
will
at
last
appear
to
be
the
effects
of
anxious
diligence
and
persevering
activity
the
nice
and
subtle
ramifications
of
meaning
were
not
easily
avoided
by
a
mind
intent
upon
accuracy
and
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
disentangling
combinations
and
separating
similitudes
many
of
the
distinctions
which
to
common
readers
appear
useless
and
idle
will
be
found
real
and
important
by
men
versed
in
the
school
philosophy
without
which
no
dictionary
shall
ever
be
accurately
compiled
or
skilfully
examined
some
senses
however
there
are
which
though
not
the
same
are
yet
so
nearly
allied
that
they
are
often
confounded
most
men
think
indistinctly
and
therefore
can
not
speak
with
exactness
and
consequently
some
examples
might
be
indifferently
put
to
either
signification
this
uncertainty
is
not
to
be
imputed
to
me
who
do
not
form
but
register
the
language
who
do
not
teach
men
how
they
should
think
but
relate
how
they
have
hitherto
expressed
their
thoughts
the
imperfect
sense
of
some
examples
i
lamented
but
could
not
remedy
and
hope
they
will
be
compensated
by
innumerable
passages
selected
with
propriety
and
preserved
with
exactness
some
shining
with
sparks
of
imagination
and
some
replete
with
treasures
of
wisdom
the
orthography
and
etymology
though
imperfect
are
not
imperfect
for
want
of
care
but
because
care
will
not
always
be
successful
and
recollection
or
information
come
too
late
for
use
that
many
terms
of
art
and
manufacture
are
omitted
must
be
frankly
acknowledged
but
for
this
defect
i
may
boldly
allege
that
it
was
unavoidable
i
could
not
visit
caverns
to
learn
the
language
nor
take
a
voyage
to
perfect
my
skill
in
the
dialect
of
navigation
nor
visit
the
warehouses
of
merchants
and
shops
of
artificers
to
gain
the
names
of
wares
tools
and
operations
of
which
no
mention
is
found
in
books
what
favourable
accident
or
easy
enquiry
brought
within
my
reach
has
not
been
neglected
but
it
had
been
a
hopeless
labour
to
glean
up
words
by
courting
living
information
and
contesting
with
the
sullenness
of
one
and
the
roughness
of
another
to
furnish
the
academicians
della
crusca
with
words
of
this
kind
a
series
of
comedies
called
la
fiera
or
the
fair
was
professedly
written
by
buonaroti
but
i
had
no
such
assistant
and
therefore
was
content
to
want
what
they
must
have
wanted
likewise
had
they
not
luckily
been
so
supplied
nor
are
all
words
which
are
not
found
in
the
vocabulary
to
be
lamented
as
omissions
of
the
laborious
and
mercantile
part
of
the
people
the
diction
is
in
a
great
measure
casual
and
mutable
many
of
their
terms
are
formed
for
some
temporary
or
local
convenience
and
though
current
at
certain
times
and
places
are
in
others
utterly
unknown
this
fugitive
cant
which
is
always
in
a
state
of
increase
or
decay
can
not
be
regarded
as
any
part
of
the
durable
materials
of
a
language
and
therefore
must
be
suffered
to
perish
with
other
things
unworthy
of
preservation
care
will
sometimes
betray
to
the
appearance
of
negligence
he
that
is
catching
opportunities
which
seldom
occur
will
suffer
those
to
pass
by
unregarded
which
he
expects
hourly
to
return
he
that
is
searching
for
rare
and
remote
things
will
neglect
those
that
are
obvious
and
familiar
thus
many
of
the
most
common
and
cursory
words
have
been
inserted
with
little
illustration
because
in
gathering
the
authorities
i
forbore
to
copy
those
which
i
thought
likely
to
occur
whenever
they
were
wanted
it
is
remarkable
that
in
reviewing
my
collection
i
found
the
word
sea
unexemplified
thus
it
happens
that
in
things
difficult
there
is
danger
from
ignorance
and
in
things
easy
from
confidence
the
mind
afraid
of
greatness
and
disdainful
of
littleness
hastily
withdraws
herself
from
painful
searches
and
passes
with
scornful
rapidity
over
tasks
not
adequate
to
her
powers
sometimes
too
secure
for
caution
and
again
too
anxious
for
vigorous
effort
sometimes
idle
in
a
plain
path
and
sometimes
distracted
in
labyrinths
and
dissipated
by
different
intentions
a
large
work
is
difficult
because
it
is
large
even
though
all
its
parts
might
singly
be
performed
with
facility
where
there
are
many
things
to
be
done
each
must
be
allowed
its
share
of
time
and
labour
in
the
proportion
only
which
it
bears
to
the
whole
nor
can
it
be
expected
that
the
stones
which
form
the
dome
of
a
temple
should
be
squared
and
polished
like
the
diamond
of
a
ring
of
the
event
of
this
work
for
which
having
laboured
it
with
so
much
application
i
can
not
but
have
some
degree
of
parental
fondness
it
is
natural
to
form
conjectures
those
who
have
been
persuaded
to
think
well
of
my
design
will
require
that
it
should
fix
our
language
and
put
a
stop
to
those
alterations
which
time
and
chance
have
hitherto
been
suffered
to
make
in
it
without
opposition
with
this
consequence
i
will
confess
that
i
flattered
myself
for
a
while
but
now
begin
to
fear
that
i
have
indulged
expectation
which
neither
reason
nor
experience
can
justify
when
we
see
men
grow
old
and
die
at
a
certain
time
one
after
another
from
century
to
century
we
laugh
at
the
elixir
that
promises
to
prolong
life
to
a
thousand
years
and
with
equal
justice
may
the
lexicographer
be
derided
who
being
able
to
produce
no
example
of
a
nation
that
has
preserved
their
words
and
phrases
from
mutability
shall
imagine
that
his
dictionary
can
embalm
his
language
and
secure
it
from
corruption
and
decay
that
it
is
in
his
power
to
change
sublunary
nature
and
clear
the
world
at
once
from
folly
vanity
and
affectation
with
this
hope
however
academies
have
been
instituted
to
guard
the
avenues
of
their
languages
to
retain
fugitives
and
repulse
intruders
but
their
vigilance
and
activity
have
hitherto
been
vain
sounds
are
too
volatile
and
subtile
for
legal
restraints
to
enchain
syllables
and
to
lash
the
wind
are
equally
the
undertakings
of
pride
unwilling
to
measure
its
desires
by
its
strength
the
french
language
has
visibly
changed
under
the
inspection
of
the
academy
the
stile
of
amelot
translation
of
father
paul
is
observed
by
le
courayer
to
be
un
peu
passe
and
no
italian
will
maintain
that
the
diction
of
any
modern
writer
is
not
perceptibly
different
from
that
of
boccace
machiavel
or
caro
total
and
sudden
transformations
of
a
language
seldom
happen
conquests
and
migrations
are
now
very
rare
but
there
are
other
causes
of
change
which
though
slow
in
their
operation
and
invisible
in
their
progress
are
perhaps
as
much
superiour
to
human
resistance
as
the
revolutions
of
the
sky
or
intumescence
of
the
tide
commerce
however
necessary
however
lucrative
as
it
depraves
the
manners
corrupts
the
language
they
that
have
frequent
intercourse
with
strangers
to
whom
they
endeavour
to
accommodate
themselves
must
in
time
learn
a
mingled
dialect
like
the
jargon
which
serves
the
traffickers
on
the
mediterranean
and
indian
coasts
this
will
not
always
be
confined
to
the
exchange
the
warehouse
or
the
port
but
will
be
communicated
by
degrees
to
other
ranks
of
the
people
and
be
at
last
incorporated
with
the
current
speech
there
are
likewise
internal
causes
equally
forcible
the
language
most
likely
to
continue
long
without
alteration
would
be
that
of
a
nation
raised
a
little
and
but
a
little
above
barbarity
secluded
from
strangers
and
totally
employed
in
procuring
the
conveniencies
of
life
either
without
books
or
like
some
of
the
mahometan
countries
with
very
few
men
thus
busied
and
unlearned
having
only
such
words
as
common
use
requires
would
perhaps
long
continue
to
express
the
same
notions
by
the
same
signs
but
no
such
constancy
can
be
expected
in
a
people
polished
by
arts
and
classed
by
subordination
where
one
part
of
the
community
is
sustained
and
accommodated
by
the
labour
of
the
other
those
who
have
much
leisure
to
think
will
always
be
enlarging
the
stock
of
ideas
and
every
increase
of
knowledge
whether
real
or
fancied
will
produce
new
words
or
combinations
of
words
when
the
mind
is
unchained
from
necessity
it
will
range
after
convenience
when
it
is
left
at
large
in
the
fields
of
speculation
it
will
shift
opinions
as
any
custom
is
disused
the
words
that
expressed
it
must
perish
with
it
as
any
opinion
grows
popular
it
will
innovate
speech
in
the
same
proportion
as
it
alters
practice
as
by
the
cultivation
of
various
sciences
a
language
is
amplified
it
will
be
more
furnished
with
words
deflected
from
original
sense
the
geometrician
will
talk
of
a
courtier
zenith
or
the
excentrick
virtue
of
a
wild
hero
and
the
physician
of
sanguine
expectations
and
phlegmatick
delays
copiousness
of
speech
will
give
opportunities
to
capricious
choice
by
which
some
words
will
be
preferred
and
others
degraded
vicissitudes
of
fashion
will
enforce
the
use
of
new
or
extend
the
signification
of
known
terms
the
tropes
of
poetry
will
make
hourly
encroachments
and
the
metaphorical
will
become
the
current
sense
pronunciation
will
be
varied
by
levity
or
ignorance
and
the
pen
must
at
length
comply
with
the
tongue
illiterate
writers
will
at
one
time
or
other
by
publick
infatuation
rise
into
renown
who
not
knowing
the
original
import
of
words
will
use
them
with
colloquial
licentiousness
confound
distinction
and
forget
propriety
as
politeness
increases
some
expressions
will
be
considered
as
too
gross
and
vulgar
for
the
delicate
others
as
too
formal
and
ceremonious
for
the
gay
and
airy
new
phrases
are
therefore
adopted
which
must
for
the
same
reasons
be
in
time
dismissed
swift
in
his
petty
treatise
on
the
english
language
allows
that
new
words
must
sometimes
be
introduced
but
proposes
that
none
should
be
suffered
to
become
obsolete
but
what
makes
a
word
obsolete
more
than
general
agreement
to
forbear
it
and
how
shall
it
be
continued
when
it
conveys
an
offensive
idea
or
recalled
again
into
the
mouths
of
mankind
when
it
has
once
become
unfamiliar
by
disuse
and
unpleasing
by
unfamiliarity
there
is
another
cause
of
alteration
more
prevalent
than
any
other
which
yet
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
can
not
be
obviated
a
mixture
of
two
languages
will
produce
a
third
distinct
from
both
and
they
will
always
be
mixed
where
the
chief
part
of
education
and
the
most
conspicuous
accomplishment
is
skill
in
ancient
or
in
foreign
tongues
he
that
has
long
cultivated
another
language
will
find
its
words
and
combinations
croud
upon
his
memory
and
haste
and
negligence
refinement
and
affectation
will
obtrude
borrowed
terms
and
exotick
expressions
the
great
pest
of
speech
is
frequency
of
translation
no
book
was
ever
turned
from
one
language
into
another
without
imparting
something
of
its
native
idiom
this
is
the
most
mischievous
and
comprehensive
innovation
single
words
may
enter
by
thousands
and
the
fabrick
of
the
tongue
continue
the
same
but
new
phraseology
changes
much
at
once
it
alters
not
the
single
stones
of
the
building
but
the
order
of
the
columns
if
an
academy
should
be
established
for
the
cultivation
of
our
stile
which
i
who
can
never
wish
to
see
dependance
multiplied
hope
the
spirit
of
english
liberty
will
hinder
or
destroy
let
them
instead
of
compiling
grammars
and
dictionaries
endeavour
with
all
their
influence
to
stop
the
licence
of
translatours
whose
idleness
and
ignorance
if
it
be
suffered
to
proceed
will
reduce
us
to
babble
a
dialect
of
france
if
the
changes
that
we
fear
be
thus
irresistible
what
remains
but
to
acquiesce
with
silence
as
in
the
other
insurmountable
distresses
of
humanity
it
remains
that
we
retard
what
we
can
not
repel
that
we
palliate
what
we
can
not
cure
life
may
be
lengthened
by
care
though
death
can
not
be
ultimately
defeated
tongues
like
governments
have
a
natural
tendency
to
degeneration
we
have
long
preserved
our
constitution
let
us
make
some
struggles
for
our
language
in
hope
of
giving
longevity
to
that
which
its
own
nature
forbids
to
be
immortal
i
have
devoted
this
book
the
labour
of
years
to
the
honour
of
my
country
that
we
may
no
longer
yield
the
palm
of
philology
without
a
contest
to
the
nations
of
the
continent
the
chief
glory
of
every
people
arises
from
its
authours
whether
i
shall
add
any
thing
by
my
own
writings
to
the
reputation
of
english
literature
must
be
left
to
time
much
of
my
life
has
been
lost
under
the
pressures
of
disease
much
has
been
trifled
away
and
much
has
always
been
spent
in
provision
for
the
day
that
was
passing
over
me
but
i
shall
not
think
my
employment
useless
or
ignoble
if
by
my
assistance
foreign
nations
and
distant
ages
gain
access
to
the
propagators
of
knowledge
and
understand
the
teachers
of
truth
if
my
labours
afford
light
to
the
repositories
of
science
and
add
celebrity
to
bacon
to
hooker
to
milton
and
to
boyle
when
i
am
animated
by
this
wish
i
look
with
pleasure
on
my
book
however
defective
and
deliver
it
to
the
world
with
the
spirit
of
a
man
that
has
endeavoured
well
that
it
will
immediately
become
popular
i
have
not
promised
to
myself
a
few
wild
blunders
and
risible
absurdities
from
which
no
work
of
such
multiplicity
was
ever
free
may
for
a
time
furnish
folly
with
laughter
and
harden
ignorance
in
contempt
but
useful
diligence
will
at
last
prevail
and
there
never
can
be
wanting
some
who
distinguish
desert
who
will
consider
that
no
dictionary
of
a
living
tongue
ever
can
be
perfect
since
while
it
is
hastening
to
publication
some
words
are
budding
and
some
falling
away
that
a
whole
life
can
not
be
spent
upon
syntax
and
etymology
and
that
even
a
whole
life
would
not
be
sufficient
that
he
whose
design
includes
whatever
language
can
express
must
often
speak
of
what
he
does
not
understand
that
a
writer
will
sometimes
be
hurried
by
eagerness
to
the
end
and
sometimes
faint
with
weariness
under
a
task
which
scaliger
compares
to
the
labours
of
the
anvil
and
the
mine
that
what
is
obvious
is
not
always
known
and
what
is
known
is
not
always
present
that
sudden
fits
of
inadvertency
will
surprize
vigilance
slight
avocations
will
seduce
attention
and
casual
eclipses
of
the
mind
will
darken
learning
and
that
the
writer
shall
often
in
vain
trace
his
memory
at
the
moment
of
need
for
that
which
yesterday
he
knew
with
intuitive
readiness
and
which
will
come
uncalled
into
his
thoughts
tomorrow
in
this
work
when
it
shall
be
found
that
much
is
omitted
let
it
not
be
forgotten
that
much
likewise
is
performed
and
though
no
book
was
ever
spared
out
of
tenderness
to
the
authour
and
the
world
is
little
solicitous
to
know
whence
proceeded
the
faults
of
that
which
it
condemns
yet
it
may
gratify
curiosity
to
inform
it
that
the
english
dictionary
was
written
with
little
assistance
of
the
learned
and
without
any
patronage
of
the
great
not
in
the
soft
obscurities
of
retirement
or
under
the
shelter
of
academick
bowers
but
amidst
inconvenience
and
distraction
in
sickness
and
in
sorrow
it
may
repress
the
triumph
of
malignant
criticism
to
observe
that
if
our
language
is
not
here
fully
displayed
i
have
only
failed
in
an
attempt
which
no
human
powers
have
hitherto
completed
if
the
lexicons
of
ancient
tongues
now
immutably
fixed
and
comprised
in
a
few
volumes
be
yet
after
the
toil
of
successive
ages
inadequate
and
delusive
if
the
aggregated
knowledge
and
diligence
of
the
italian
academicians
did
not
secure
them
from
the
censure
of
beni
if
the
embodied
criticks
of
france
when
fifty
years
had
been
spent
upon
their
work
were
obliged
to
change
its
oeconomy
and
give
their
second
edition
another
form
i
may
surely
be
contented
without
the
praise
of
perfection
which
if
i
could
obtain
in
this
gloom
of
solitude
what
would
it
avail
me
i
have
protracted
my
work
till
most
of
those
whom
i
wished
to
please
have
sunk
into
the
grave
and
success
and
miscarriage
are
empty
sounds
i
therefore
dismiss
it
with
frigid
tranquillity
having
little
to
fear
or
hope
from
censure
or
from
praise
the
end
