the
last
day
prologue
the
eve
between
the
grey
walls
of
its
bath
so
like
its
cradle
and
its
coffin
lay
one
of
those
small
and
lonely
creatures
which
inhabit
the
surface
of
the
earth
for
seventy
years
as
on
every
other
evening
the
sun
was
sinking
and
the
moon
unseen
was
rising
the
round
head
of
flesh
and
bone
floated
upon
the
deep
water
of
the
bath
why
should
i
move
rolled
its
thoughts
bewitched
by
solitude
the
earth
itself
is
moving
summer
and
winter
and
winter
and
summer
i
have
travelled
in
my
head
saying
secrets
all
wonders
lie
within
the
breast
but
now
that
is
at
an
end
and
i
go
upon
a
journey
i
have
been
accustomed
to
finding
something
in
nothing
how
do
i
know
if
i
am
equipped
for
a
larger
horizon
and
suddenly
the
little
creature
chanted
aloud
the
strange
things
of
travel
the
east
and
the
west
the
hill
beyond
the
hill
they
lie
within
the
breast
part
i
the
black
hut

chapter
i
the
traveller
the
war
had
stopped
the
king
of
england
was
in
paris
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
hourly
expected
humbler
guests
poured
each
night
from
the
termini
into
the
overflowing
city
and
sought
anxiously
for
some
bed
or
pillowed
corner
in
which
to
rest
until
the
morning
stretched
upon
the
table
in
a
branch
of
the
lay
a
young
woman
from
england
whose
clothes
were
of
khaki
and
whose
name
was
fanny
she
had
arrived
that
night
at
the
gare
du
nord
at
eight
and
the
following
night
at
eight
she
left
paris
by
the
gare
de
just
as
she
entered
the
station
a
small
boy
with
a
basket
of
violets
for
sale
held
a
bunch
to
her
face
no
thank
you
he
pursued
her
and
held
it
against
her
chin
no
thank
you
but
i
give
it
to
you
i
it
to
you
as
she
had
neither
slept
on
the
boat
from
southampton
nor
on
the
table
of
the
tears
of
pleasure
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
took
them
but
while
she
dragged
her
heavy
kitbag
and
her
suitcase
across
the
platform
another
boy
of
a
different
spirit
ran
beside
her
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
wait
a
minute
he
panted
well
have
you
heard
have
you
heard
the
war
is
over
she
continued
to
drag
the
weighty
sack
behind
her
over
the
platform
she
did
know
howled
the
wicked
boy
no
one
had
told
her
and
in
the
train
which
carried
her
towards
the
dead
of
night
the
taunt
and
the
violets
accompanied
her
at
two
in
the
morning
she
reached
the
station
of
the
rain
rattled
down
through
the
broken
roof
as
she
crossed
the
lines
of
the
platform
on
the
further
side
where
vaguely
expecting
to
be
met
she
questioned
civilians
and
military
police
but
the
pall
of
death
that
hung
over
bar
stretched
even
to
the
station
where
nobody
knew
anything
expected
anything
cared
anything
except
to
hurry
out
and
away
into
the
rain
she
too
followed
at
last
leaving
her
bag
and
box
in
the
corner
of
a
deserted
office
and
crossing
the
station
yard
tramped
out
in
the
thick
mud
on
to
a
bridge
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
and
crouching
for
a
minute
in
a
doorway
she
made
her
bundles
faster
and
buttoned
up
her
coat
roofs
jutted
above
her
pavements
sounded
under
her
feet
the
clock
struck
three
near
by
if
there
was
an
hotel
anywhere
there
was
no
one
to
give
information
about
it
the
last
train
had
emptied
itself
the
travellers
had
hurried
off
into
the
night
and
not
a
foot
rang
upon
the
pavements
the
rain
ran
in
a
stream
down
her
cap
and
on
to
her
face
down
her
sleeves
and
on
to
her
hands
a
light
further
up
the
street
attracted
her
attention
and
walking
towards
it
she
found
that
it
came
from
an
open
doorway
above
which
she
could
make
out
the
letters
she
did
not
know
with
what
complicated
feelings
she
would
come
to
regard
these
letters
with
what
gratitude
mixed
with
irritation
with
greed
climbing
the
steps
she
looked
inside
the
hall
of
the
building
was
paved
with
stone
and
on
a
couple
of
dozen
summer
chairs
of
cane
sat
as
many
american
officers
dozing
in
painful
attitudes
of
unrest
by
each
ran
a
stream
of
water
that
trickled
from
his
clothes
and
the
streams
joining
each
other
formed
aimless
rivers
upon
the
floor
the
eye
of
a
captain
opened
come
in
he
said
without
moving
she
wondered
whether
she
should
the
eye
of
a
lieutenant
opened
come
in
he
said
and
rose
take
my
chair
could
you
tell
me
if
there
is
any
hotel
there
is
some
sort
of
a
shanty
down
the
street
i
take
you
further
up
the
street
a
faint
light
shone
under
a
slit
between
two
boards
there
was
no
door
near
it
no
keyhole
or
shutter
the
american
thundered
at
the
boards
with
a
tin
of
jam
which
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
noise
was
monstrous
in
the
blackness
but
the
town
had
heard
noises
more
monstrous
than
that
and
it
lay
in
a
barred
and
blind
unanswering
stupor
god
said
the
american
quickly
angered
and
kicked
the
board
till
the
slit
grew
larger
the
light
went
out
some
one
is
coming
round
to
the
door
said
fanny
in
time
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
the
board
higher
up
the
street
bolts
were
being
withdrawn
and
a
light
fell
upon
the
pavement
who
there
creaked
a
voice
the
american
moved
towards
the
light
the
hotel
is
shut
to
americans
said
the
voice
the
devil
it
is
shouted
the
american
and
why
then
man
killed
here
last
night
said
the
voice
briefly
fanny
moved
towards
the
light
and
saw
an
old
man
with
a
shawl
upon
his
shoulders
who
held
a
candle
fixed
in
the
neck
of
a
bottle
i
am
english
she
said
to
the
old
man
i
am
alone
i
want
a
room
alone
i
a
room
if
you
not
american
i
do
know
what
kind
of
a
hole
this
is
said
the
american
wrathfully
i
think
you
better
come
right
back
to
the
say
here
what
kind
of
a
row
was
this
last
night
you
got
a
man
killed
in
kind
of
row
your
countrymen
make
muttered
the
old
man
and
added
bandits
soothing
on
the
one
hand
entreating
on
the
other
the
girl
got
rid
of
her
new
friend
and
effected
an
entrance
into
the
hotel
if
hotel
it
is
she
thought
in
the
brief
passage
of
a
panic
while
the
old
man
stooped
to
the
bolts
of
the
door
i
got
rooms
enough
he
said
rooms
enough
now
gone
follow
me
she
followed
his
candle
flame
and
he
threw
open
a
door
upon
the
ground
floor
i
no
light
to
give
you
yet
i
must
have
a
light
grumbling
he
produced
half
an
inch
of
wax
candle
hurry
into
bed
and
that
will
last
you
it
all
i
have
the
bed
wore
a
coloured
rug
bare
and
thin
an
eiderdown
damp
and
musty
spreading
her
wet
mackintosh
on
the
top
she
rolled
herself
up
as
well
as
she
could
and
developing
a
sort
of
warmth
towards
morning
slept
an
hour
or
two
the
daylight
showed
her
nothing
to
wash
in
no
jug
no
basin
no
bell
to
pull
as
no
one
would
come
to
her
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
waiting
she
got
up
and
going
into
the
hall
entered
a
dark
in
which
breakfast
was
served
at
its
lowest
ebb
black
coffee
sugarless
and
two
pieces
of
dry
bread
yet
having
eaten
she
was
able
to
think
i
am
a
soldier
of
five
sous
i
am
here
to
drive
for
the
french
army
and
her
thoughts
pleased
her
so
well
that
at
the
moment
when
her
circumstances
were
in
their
state
of
least
perfection
she
exclaimed
how
right
i
was
to
come
and
set
off
down
the
street
to
find
her
companions
a
mile
out
of
the
town
upon
the
banks
of
a
tributary
of
the
meuse
stood
a
deserted
glass
factory
which
had
been
converted
by
the
french
into
a
garage
for
a
fleet
of
thirty
cars
above
the
garage
was
a
large
attic
used
as
a
dormitory
for
the
mechanics
drivers
and
clerks
in
a
smaller
room
at
the
end
slept
the
officers
the
and
the
two
des
a
hundred
yards
from
the
factory
built
upon
the
brink
of
the
stream
which
was
now
in
flood
and
reached
from
the
road
by
a
narrow
wooden
bridge
stood
a
tarred
hut
of
wood
and
tarpaulin
it
was
built
upon
simple
lines
a
narrow
corridor
ran
down
the
centre
of
it
and
on
either
hand
were
four
square
cells
divided
one
from
the
other
by
grey
paper
stretched
upon
laths
of
wood
making
eight
in
all
at
one
end
was
a
small
hall
filled
with
mackintoshes
at
the
other
a
this
was
the
home
of
the
women
drivers
attached
to
the
garage
in
one
of
these
paper
cells
henceforward
to
be
her
own
fanny
set
up
her
intimate
life
outside
the
black
hut
the
night
poured
water
down
inside
the
eight
cubicles
held
each
a
woman
a
bed
and
a
hurricane
lantern
fanny
in
her
paper
box
listened
to
the
scratching
of
a
pen
next
door
then
turned
her
eyes
as
a
new
and
nearer
scratching
caught
her
ear
a
rat
stared
at
her
through
the
hole
it
had
made
in
the
wall
food
is
in
out
of
the
boxes
came
the
eight
women
to
eat
pieces
of
dark
meat
from
a
tin
set
on
the
top
of
the
stove
then
cheese
and
bread
the
watery
night
turned
into
sleet
and
rattled
like
on
the
panes
where
is
stewart
she
is
not
back
yet
soon
the
eight
crept
back
to
their
boxes
and
sat
again
by
the
lamps
to
read
or
darn
or
write
they
lived
so
close
to
each
other
that
even
the
most
genial
had
learnt
to
care
for
solitude
and
the
remained
empty
the
noise
of
stewart
feet
sounded
in
the
corridor
she
swung
a
lantern
in
her
hand
her
face
was
shining
her
hair
streaming
is
there
any
food
it
on
the
stove
is
it
eatable
no
silence
for
a
while
and
then
one
by
one
they
crept
out
into
the
black
mud
beyond
the
hut
to
fill
their
cans
with
hot
water
from
the
and
so
to
bed
on
stretchers
slung
on
trestles
where
those
who
did
not
sleep
listened
through
the
long
night
to
those
who
slept
too
well
are
you
awake
came
with
the
daylight
ah
you
are
washing
you
are
doing
your
hair
there
was
no
privacy
how
cold
how
cold
the
water
is
sighed
fanny
and
a
voice
through
the
paper
wall
catching
the
shivering
whisper
exclaimed
use
your
bottle
what
for
empty
it
into
your
basin
if
you
have
kept
it
in
your
bed
all
night
you
will
find
the
water
has
the
chill
off
those
who
had
to
be
out
early
had
left
before
the
daylight
still
with
their
lanterns
swinging
in
their
hands
had
battled
with
the
cold
cars
in
the
unlighted
garage
and
were
moving
alone
across
the
long
desert
of
the
battlefields
on
the
first
morning
she
was
tested
on
an
old
ambulance
and
passed
the
test
on
the
second
morning
she
got
her
first
run
upon
a
charron
car
that
had
been
assigned
to
her
driving
into
in
the
early
morning
under
a
grey
flood
of
rain
she
asked
of
a
which
is
the
rue
thierry
she
got
no
answer
the
french
too
poor
and
wet
did
not
trouble
to
reply
the
americans
did
not
know
as
she
drove
along
at
the
side
of
the
road
there
came
a
roar
out
of
the
distance
and
a
stream
of
american
lorries
thundered
down
the
street
men
women
and
children
ran
for
their
lives
to
gain
the
pavements
as
the
lorries
passed
a
covered
fanny
face
and
hands
and
dripped
from
her
windscreen
why
do
they
drive
like
that
she
wondered
hunting
blindly
for
her
handkerchief
and
mopping
at
her
face
she
thought
there
must
be
some
desperate
need
calling
for
the
lorries
and
looked
after
them
with
respect
when
she
had
found
her
street
and
fetched
her
client
she
drove
at
his
order
to
souilly
upon
the
great
road
to
verdun
and
all
day
calling
at
little
villages
upon
the
way
where
he
had
business
she
drove
with
the
caution
of
the
newcomer
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
need
for
caution
she
saw
a
ford
roll
over
leave
the
road
and
drop
into
the
ditch
the
wild
american
who
had
driven
it
to
its
death
pulled
himself
up
upon
the
road
and
limping
hailed
a
passing
lorry
and
went
upon
his
way
she
saw
a
horse
gallop
out
of
a
camp
with
a
terrified
annamite
upon
its
back
horse
and
annamite
shot
past
her
on
the
road
the
yellow
eyes
popping
from
his
head
his
body
slipping
falling
falling
when
she
would
have
slowed
the
car
to
watch
the
end
of
the
flight
her
client
cried
to
her
why
do
you
wait
enormous
american
guns
trailed
behind
lorries
driven
by
boys
swayed
from
side
to
side
on
the
greasy
road
and
threatened
to
crush
her
like
an
everywhere
she
saw
a
wild
disregard
for
life
everywhere
she
winced
before
the
menace
of
speed
of
weight
of
thundering
metal
in
the
late
afternoon
returning
home
in
the
she
overtook
a
convoy
of
lorries
driven
by
annamites
hooting
with
her
horn
she
crept
past
three
lorries
and
drew
abreast
of
the
fourth
then
misjudging
she
let
the
tip
of
her
low
mudguard
touch
the
front
wheel
of
the
foremost
lorry
the
touch
was
so
slight
that
she
had
passed
on
but
at
a
cry
she
drew
up
and
looked
back
the
lorry
which
she
had
touched
was
overhanging
the
edge
of
the
road
and
its
radiator
striking
a
tree
had
dropped
down
into
the
valley
below
climbing
from
her
car
she
ran
back
and
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
annamites
who
chirped
and
twittered
at
her
and
wrung
their
little
hands
what
can
i
do
she
said
to
them
aloud
in
distress
but
they
understood
nothing
and
seemed
to
echo
in
their
strange
bird
language
what
can
do
what
can
do
and
i
she
thought
in
consternation
am
responsible
for
this
but
the
last
lorry
had
drawn
alongside
and
a
french
sergeant
descended
from
it
and
joined
the
annamites
he
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
road
saw
the
radiator
below
upon
a
rock
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
catching
sight
of
fanny
face
of
horror
he
laughed
vous
en
faîtes
pas
these
poor
devils
sleep
as
they
drive
yes
even
with
their
eyes
open
we
started
nine
this
morning
we
were
four
when
we
met
you
and
now
we
are
three
on
the
third
morning
the
rain
stopped
for
an
hour
or
two
fanny
had
no
run
till
the
afternoon
and
going
into
the
garage
in
the
morning
she
set
to
work
on
her
car
where
can
i
get
water
she
asked
a
man
the
pump
is
broken
he
replied
i
backed
my
car
against
it
last
night
but
there
is
a
tap
by
that
broken
wall
on
the
piece
of
waste
ground
she
crossed
to
the
wall
with
her
bucket
standing
upon
the
waste
ground
was
an
old
closed
limousine
whose
engine
had
long
been
injured
past
repair
one
of
the
glass
windows
was
broken
but
it
was
as
roomy
and
comfortable
as
a
railway
carriage
and
the
men
often
sat
in
it
in
a
spare
moment
the
yard
cleared
suddenly
for
the
eleven
meal
as
fanny
passed
the
limousine
a
man
appeared
at
the
broken
window
and
beckoned
to
her
his
face
was
white
and
he
wore
his
shirt
trousers
and
braces
she
stopped
short
with
the
bucket
in
her
hand
on
est
delivré
de
cette
bande
he
said
pointing
to
the
yard
and
she
went
a
little
nearer
wait
till
i
get
my
coat
on
he
said
softly
to
her
and
struggled
into
his
coat
he
put
both
his
hands
on
the
window
ledge
leant
towards
her
and
said
clearly
je
suis
le
président
wilson
you
are
the
president
wilson
she
echoed
hunting
for
the
joke
and
willing
to
smile
he
passed
her
out
his
and
a
tin
box
you
must
fill
these
for
me
he
said
fill
the
bottle
with
wine
and
get
me
bread
and
meat
be
quick
you
know
i
must
be
off
the
king

me
where

slept
here
last
night
i
have
come
far
but
i
must
be
quick
now
for
it
late
and
i
believe
in
freedom
he
finished
emphatically
well
will
you
wait
till
i
have
made
you
up
a
parcel
of
food
only
be
quick
will
you
wait
in
the
car
promise
to
wait
yes
be
quick
look
sharp
she
put
down
her
bucket
and
stretched
up
her
hand
for
the
bottle
and
the
box
he
held
them
above
her
a
second
hesitating
then
put
them
into
her
hand
she
turned
from
him
and
went
back
into
the
yard
as
she
approached
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
men
sat
eating
she
looked
round
and
saw
that
he
was
watching
her
intently
she
waved
once
soothingly
then
slipped
into
the
long
room
filled
with
the
hum
of
voices
and
the
smell
of
gravy
there
is
a
poor
madman
in
the
yard
she
whispered
to
the
man
nearest
her
the
others
looked
up
they
lost
a
man
from
the
asylum
i
heard
in
the
town
this
morning
said
one
we
must
keep
him
here
till
we
telephone
have
you
told
the
brigadier
mademoiselle

him
i
go
back
and
talk
to
the
man
ask
the
brigadier
to
telephone
i
come
with
you
mademoiselle
said
another
where
is
he
in
the
old
limousine
by
the
water
tap
he
is
quiet
do
frighten
him
by
coming
all
together
chairs
and
benches
were
pushed
back
and
the
men
stood
up
in
groups
we
will
go
round
by
the
gate
in
case
he
makes
a
run
for
it
better
not
use
force
if
one
can
help
it
fanny
and
her
companion
went
out
to
the
car
where
is
my
food
and
wine
called
the
man
it
coming
answered
fanny
they
are
doing
it
up
in
the
kitchen
well
i
ca
wait
i
must
go
without
it
i
ca
keep
the
king
waiting
and
he
opened
the
door
of
the
limousine
as
he
stood
on
the
step
he
held
a
bundle
of
rusty
weapons
what
that
you
got
bosche
daggers
he
said
see
he
held
one
towards
her
without
letting
it
go
from
his
hand
where
did
you
find
those
on
the
battlefields
he
climbed
down
the
steps
stay
a
moment
said
fanny
i
in
a
difficulty
will
you
help
me
what
that
but
i
no
time
do
you
know
about
cars
i
was
in
the
trade
he
nodded
his
head
i
have
trouble
i
can
not
tell
what
to
do
will
you
come
and
see
if
it
a
matter
of
a
moment
but
i
must
be
away
if
you
leave
all
those
things
in
the
car
you
could
fetch
them
as
you
go
suggested
fanny
eyeing
the
daggers
the
man
whistled
and
screwed
up
one
eye
when
one
believes
in
freedom
one
must
go
armed
he
said
show
me
the
car
going
with
her
to
the
he
looked
at
the
of
the
car
at
her
suggestion
unscrewing
three
from
their
seatings
at
the
fourth
he
grew
tired
and
said
fretfully
now
i
must
be
off
you
know
i
must
the
king
expects
me
he
walked
to
the
gate
of
the
yard
and
she
saw
the
men
behind
the
gate
about
to
close
on
him
you
not
wearing
your
decorations
she
called
after
him
he
stopped
looked
down
looked
a
little
troubled
she
took
the
gilt
safety
pin
from
her
tie
the
safety
pin
that
held
her
collar
to
her
blouse
at
the
back
and
another
from
the
back
of
her
skirt
and
pinned
them
along
his
poor
coat
an
ambulance
drove
quickly
into
the
yard
and
three
men
descending
from
it
hurried
towards
them
at
sight
of
them
the
poor
madman
grew
frantic
and
turning
upon
fanny
he
cried
you
are
against
me
then
ran
across
the
yard
she
shut
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
see
them
hunt
the
lover
of
freedom
and
only
opened
them
when
a
man
cried
in
triumph
take
you
to
the
king
pauvre
malheureux
muttered
the
drivers
in
the
yard
day
followed
day
and
there
was
plenty
of
work
officers
had
to
be
driven
upon
rounds
of
two
hundred
kilometres
a
day
interviewing
mayors
of
ruined
villages
listening
to
claims
assessing
damage
caused
by
french
troops
in
billets
others
inspected
distant
motor
parks
others
made
offers
to
purchase
old
iron
among
the
villages
in
order
to
prove
thefts
from
the
battlefields
the
early
start
at
dawn
the
flying
miles
the
winter
dusk
the
long
hours
of
travel
by
the
faint
light
of
the
acetylene
lamps
filled
day
after
day
the
unsavoury
meal
eaten
alone
by
the
stove
the
book
read
alone
in
the
cubicle
the
fitful
sleep
upon
the
stretcher
filled
night
after
night
a
loneliness
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
known
settled
upon
fanny
she
found
comfort
in
a
look
a
cry
a
whistle
the
smiles
of
strange
men
upon
the
road
whom
she
would
never
see
again
became
her
social
intercourse
the
lost
smiles
of
kind
americans
the
lost
mocking
whistles
of
frenchmen
the
scream
of
a
nigger
the
twittering
surprise
of
a
chinese
scavenger
yet
she
was
glad
to
have
come
for
half
the
world
was
here
there
could
have
been
nothing
like
it
since
the
tower
of
babel
the
country
around
her
was
a
vast
tract
of
men
sick
with
longing
for
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
have
you
to
be
here
asked
an
american
no
i
wanted
to
come
the
eye
of
the
american
said
fool
are
you
paid
to
come
here
asked
a
frenchman
no
in
a
sense
i
pay
to
come
the
eye
of
the
frenchman
said
englishwoman
each
day
she
drove
in
a
wash
of
rain
each
night
she
returned
long
after
dark
and
putting
her
car
in
the
garage
felt
her
way
up
the
inky
road
by
the
rushing
of
the
river
at
its
edge
crossed
the
wooden
bridge
and
entered
the
cell
which
she
tried
to
make
her
personal
haven
but
if
personal
it
was
the
personality
of
a
dog
it
had
the
character
of
a
kennel
she
had
brought
no
furnishings
with
her
from
england
she
could
buy
nothing
in
the
town
the
wooden
floor
was
swamped
by
the
rain
which
blew
through
the
window
the
paper
on
the
walls
was
torn
by
rats
tarry
drops
from
the
roof
had
fallen
upon
her
unmade
bed
the
sight
of
this
bed
caused
her
a
nightly
dismay
oh
if
i
could
but
make
it
in
the
morning
how
different
this
room
would
look
there
would
be
no
one
in
the
but
a
tin
would
stand
on
the
stove
with
one
two
or
three
pieces
of
meat
in
it
by
this
she
knew
whether
the
cubicles
were
full
or
if
one
or
two
were
empty
sometimes
the
coffee
jug
would
rise
too
lightly
from
the
floor
as
she
lifted
it
and
in
an
angry
voice
she
would
call
through
the
hut
there
is
no
coffee
silence
silence
till
a
voice
goaded
by
the
silence
cried
ask
madeleine
and
madeleine
the
little
maid
had
long
since
gone
over
to
laugh
with
the
men
in
the
garage
then
came
the
owners
of
the
second
and
third
piece
of
meat
stumbling
across
the
bridge
and
up
the
corridor
lantern
in
hand
and
fanny
perhaps
remembering
a
treasure
left
in
her
car
would
rise
leave
them
to
eat
feel
her
way
to
the
garage
and
back
again
to
the
safety
of
her
room
with
a
tin
of
sweetened
condensed
milk
under
her
arm
so
low
in
comfort
had
she
sunk
it
needed
but
this
to
make
her
happy
she
had
never
known
so
sharp
so
sweet
a
sense
of
luxury
as
that
with
which
she
prepared
the
delicacy
she
had
seized
by
her
own
cunning
it
had
not
taken
her
long
to
learn
the
possibilities
of
the
american
the
branch
in
bar
or
any
other
which
she
might
pass
in
her
travels
shameless
she
was
as
she
leant
upon
the
counter
in
some
distant
village
cajoling
persuading
spinning
some
tale
of
want
and
necessity
more
picturesque
though
no
less
actual
than
her
own
secret
too
lest
one
of
her
companions
should
spoil
her
hunting
ground
sitting
with
her
leather
coat
over
her
shoulders
happy
in
her
solitude
she
would
drink
the
cup
of
benger
food
which
she
had
made
from
the
milk
and
when
it
was
finished
slide
lower
among
the
rugs
put
out
the
lights
and
listen
to
the
rustle
of
the
rats
in
the
wall
mary
bell
is
getting
married
said
a
clear
voice
in
the
hut
to
the
wykely
boy
answered
a
second
voice
and
in
a
sudden
need
of
sound
the
two
voices
talked
on
while
the
six
listeners
upon
their
stretchers
saw
in
the
dark
the
life
and
happiness
of
mary
bell
blossom
before
them
unknown
and
bright
the
alarm
clock
went
off
with
a
scream
at
five
why
i
hardly
been
asleep
sighed
fanny
bewildered
and
getting
up
she
lit
the
lamp
and
made
her
coffee
again
there
was
not
time
to
make
the
bed
though
fresh
to
the
work
she
believed
that
she
had
been
there
for
ever
yet
the
women
with
whom
she
shared
her
life
had
driven
the
roads
of
the
meuse
district
for
months
before
she
came
to
them
and
their
eyes
were
dim
with
peering
into
the
dark
nights
and
they
were
tired
past
any
sense
of
adventure
past
any
wish
or
power
to
better
their
condition
on
and
on
and
on
rolled
the
days
and
though
one
might
add
them
together
and
make
them
seven
they
never
made
sunday
for
there
is
no
sunday
in
the
french
army
there
is
no
bell
at
which
tools
are
laid
aside
and
not
even
the
night
is
sacred
on
and
on
rolled
the
weeks
and
the
weeks
made
months
till
all
november
was
gone
and
all
december
and
the
new
year
broke
in
fresh
torrents
of
rain
fanny
made
friends
all
day
and
lost
them
again
for
ever
as
she
passed
on
upon
the
roads
sometimes
it
was
a
sentry
beside
whom
her
clients
left
her
for
an
hour
while
they
inspected
a
barracks
sometimes
it
was
an
old
woman
who
called
from
a
doorway
that
she
might
come
and
warm
her
hands
at
the
fire
sometimes
an
american
who
helped
her
to
change
a
tyre
there
were
times
further
up
towards
verdun
where
there
were
no
old
women
or
young
women
or
villages
when
she
thought
her
friends
were
mad
deranged
eccentric
in
their
loneliness
my
sister
has
a
grand
piano
said
one
american
to
her
opening
thus
his
conversation
but
he
mused
upon
it
and
spoke
no
further
yes
she
encouraged
yes
he
did
not
open
his
mind
until
she
was
leaving
when
he
said
simply
to
her
i
wish
i
was
back
home
and
between
the
two
sentences
all
the
pictures
of
his
home
were
flowing
in
his
thoughts
an
old
woman
offered
her
shelter
in
a
village
while
her
clients
were
busy
with
the
mayor
in
the
kitchen
there
was
a
tiny
fire
of
twigs
american
boys
stamped
in
and
out
of
the
house
laughing
begging
the
daughter
to
sew
on
a
button
sell
them
an
egg
boys
of
nineteen
and
twenty
fair
tall
and
we
shall
be
glad
when
they
are
gone
said
the
old
woman
looking
at
their
gay
faces
they
are
children
she
added
with
the
faults
of
children
they
seem
they
are
beautiful
boys
said
the
peasant
woman
and
but
i
tired
of
them
children
are
all
very
well
but
to
have
your
house
full
of
them
your
village
your
they
play
all
day
in
the
street
chasing
the
dogs
throwing
balls
when
our
children
come
out
of
school
there
no
holding
them
they
must
be
off
playing
with
the
americans
the
war
is
over
why
do
they
take
them
home
said
a
tall
boy
coming
up
to
fanny
you
sure
cold
we
brought
you
this
and
he
offered
her
a
cup
of
coffee
he
had
fetched
from
his
canteen
yes
they
good
boys
said
the
old
woman
but
one
does
want
other
people
children
always
in
one
life
is
this
a
park
fanny
asked
a
soldier
in
the
next
village
a
village
whose
four
streets
were
filled
with
rows
of
lorries
touring
cars
and
ambulances
on
every
car
the
iron
was
frail
with
rust
the
bonnets
of
some
were
torn
off
a
wheel
two
wheels
were
missing
the
side
ripped
open
disclosing
the
rusting
bones
pardon
madame
what
are
you
doing
here
we
are
left
behind
from
the
fourth
army
which
has
gone
up
to
germany
i
have
no
tools
or
i
would
make
one
car
out
of
four
but
my
men

discouraged
and
no
one
works
the
war
is
over
then
this
is
a
park
no
madame
it
is
a
cemetery
months
went
by
and
there
came
a
night
as
wet
and
sad
as
any
other
when
no
premonitory
star
showed
in
the
sky
and
all
that
was
bright
in
fanny
spirit
toned
itself
to
match
the
monotonous
shadowless
pallor
about
her
she
was
upon
her
homeward
journey
at
the
entrance
to
the
hut
she
paused
for
such
a
light
was
burning
in
the
that
it
travelled
even
the
dark
corridor
and
wandered
out
upon
the
step
by
it
she
could
see
the
beaded
moisture
of
the
upon
the
long
hair
escaped
from
her
cap
a
group
of
women
stood
within
their
faces
turned
towards
the
door
as
she
entered
fanny
what
is
it
we
are
going
to
metz
we
are
ordered
to
metz
stewart
waved
a
letter
was
poverty
and
solitude
at
an
end
they
did
not
know
it
in
leaving
the
meuse
district
did
they
leave
too
the
boundless
rain
the
swollen
rivers
the
shining
swamps
the
mud
which
ebbed
and
flowed
upon
the
land
like
a
tide
was
hunger
at
an
end
discomfort
and
poor
living
they
had
no
inkling
fanny
indifferent
to
any
change
hoping
for
nothing
better
turned
first
to
the
meat
tin
for
she
was
hungry
metz

a
town

hazarded
of

of
my
one
pair
of
silk
stockings

silk
stockings
with
you
yes
i
i
am
equipped
for
anything
there
came
a
morning
as
wet
and
sad
as
any
other
when
stewart
and
fanny
seated
in
the
back
of
an
ambulance
their
feet
overhanging
the
edge
watched
the
black
hut
dwindle
upon
the
road
and
wondered
how
any
one
had
lived
there
so
long
part
ii
lorraine
chapter
ii
metz
with
its
back
to
the
woods
and
hills
of
luxembourg
with
its
face
to
the
desolation
of
northern
france
the
city
of
metz
stood
at
the
entry
of
lorraine
like
the
gate
to
a
new
world
the
traveller
arriving
after
long
hours
of
journey
through
the
battlefields
might
sigh
with
relief
gape
with
pleasure
then
hurry
away
down
deflagged
streets
beneath
houses
roped
with
garlands
to
eat
divinely
at
moitrier
restaurant
and
join
the
dancing
in
the
hall
below
not
a
night
passed
in
metz
without
the
beat
of
music
upon
the
frosty
air
it
burst
into
the
narrow
streets
from
where
the
soldiers
danced
from
halls
from
of
confiscated
german
houses
where
officers
of
the
grand
quartier
général
danced
a
triumph
or
it
might
be
supposed
to
be
a
triumph
by
the
germans
who
stayed
in
their
homes
after
dark
they
might
suppose
that
the
french
officers
danced
for
happiness
that
they
danced
because
they
were
french
because
they
were
victorious
because
they
were
young
because
they
must
it
was
not
surely
the
wild
dancing
of
the
host
whose
party
drags
a
little
who
calls
for
more
champagne
more
fiddles
in
the
centre
of
the
city
of
metz
sat
the
maréchal
pétain
and
kept
his
eye
upon
lorraine
he
was
not
a
man
who
cared
for
gaiety
but
should
the
lorraines
be
insufficiently
amused
he
gave
them
balls
insufficiently
fed
he
sent
for
flour
and
sugar
all
the
flour
and
sugar
that
france
could
spare
more
much
more
than
paris
had
and
at
his
bidding
the
flowered
with
millefeuilles
brioches
choux
à
la
and
cakes
more
marvellous
with
german
names
france
poor
and
hungry
flung
all
she
had
into
alsace
and
lorraine
that
she
might
make
her
entry
with
the
assuring
dazzle
of
the
benefactress
the
lorraines
like
children
were
fed
with
sugar
while
the
meat
shops
were
empty
were
kept
dancing
in
national
costume
that
they
might
forget
to
ask
for
leather
boots
to
wonder
where
wool
and
silk
were
hiding
fêtes
were
organised
colours
were
paraded
in
the
square
torchlight
processions
were
started
on
saturday
nights
when
the
boys
of
the
town
went
crying
and
whooping
behind
the
march
of
the
flares
artists
were
sent
for
from
paris
took
train
to
nancy
and
were
driven
laboriously
through
hours
of
snow
over
miles
of
roads
that
they
might
sing
and
play
in
the
theatre
or
in
the
house
of
the
governor
to
the
dances
to
the
dinners
to
the
plays
came
the
lorraine
women
wearing
white
cotton
stockings
to
set
off
their
thick
ankles
and
dancing
in
figures
and
set
dances
unknown
to
the
officers
from
paris
the
commandant
dormans
head
of
all
motor
transport
under
the
grand
quartier
général
having
prepared
his
german
as
a
ballroom
having
danced
all
the
evening
with
ladies
from
the
surrounding
hills
found
himself
fatigued
and
exasperated
by
the
side
of
the
head
of
foreign
units
attached
to
the
automobile
service
i
thought
you
had
englishwomen
at
he
said
to
the
latter
i
have
eight

are
they
doing
at

them
here

dance
all
night
englishwomen
do
dance
do
they
i
have
never
been
to
england
get
them
here
send
for
them
so
through
his
whim
it
happened
that
six
days
later
a
little
caravan
of
women
crossed
the
old
front
lines
beyond
as
dusk
was
falling
and
as
dark
was
falling
entered
the
gates
of
metz
they
leant
from
the
ambulance
excitedly
as
the
lights
of
the
streets
flashed
past
them
saw
windows
piled
with
pale
bricks
of
butter
bars
of
chocolates
tins
of
preserved
strawberries
and
jams
can
you
see
the
price
on
the
butter
what
i
ca
see
yes
francs
a
pound
good
heavens
ah
is
it
possible
éclairs
eclairs
and
with
exclamations
of
awe
they
saw
the
cake
shops
in
the
serpenoise
german
boys
cried
american
girls
american
girls
and
threw
paper
balls
into
the
back
of
the
ambulance
i
heard
i
heard
what
is
it
i
heard
german
spoken
did
you
think
then
they
were
all
dead
no
but
fanny
felt
like
some
old
scholar
who
hears
a
dead
language
spoken
in
a
vanished
town
they
drove
on
past
the
cathedral
into
the
open
square
of
the
place
du
theâtre
half
the
old
french
theatre
had
been
set
aside
as
offices
for
the
automobile
service
and
now
the
officers
of
the
service
who
had
waited
for
them
with
curiosity
greeted
them
on
the
steps
you
must
be
tired
you
must
be
hungry
leave
the
ambulance
where
it
is
and
come
now
as
you
are
to
dine
with
us
in
the
uncertain
light
from
the
lamp
on
the
theatre
steps
the
french
tried
to
see
the
english
faces
the
women
glanced
at
the
men
and
they
walked
together
to
the
mess
room
in
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
empty
square
a
long
table
was
spread
with
a
white
cloth
with
silver
with
flowers
as
though
they
were
expected
soldiers
waited
behind
the
chairs
vauclin

but
these
ladies

french
marvellously
some
one
in
another
house
was
playing
an
ancient
instrument
its
music
stole
across
the
open
square
soldiers
passed
singing
in
the
street
a
hundred
miles
a
hundred
years
away
lay
liquid
in
mud
soaked
in
eternal
rain
what
was
i
thought
fanny
in
amazement
to
what
had
i
come
in
that
black
hut
and
she
thought
that
she
had
run
down
to
the
bottom
of
living
lain
on
that
hard
floor
where
the
poor
lie
known
what
it
was
to
live
as
the
poor
live
in
a
hole
without
generosity
beauty
or
privacy
in
a
hole
dirty
and
cold
plain
and
coarse
she
glanced
at
her
neighbour
with
wonder
and
appreciation
delight
and
envy
there
was
a
light
clean
scent
upon
his
hair
she
saw
his
hands
his
nails
and
her
own
a
young
jew
opposite
her
had
his
hair
curled
and
a
faint
powdery
bloom
about
his
face
but
never
mind
that
is
civilisation
there
are
people
who
turn
from
that
and
cry
for
nature
but
i
since
i
lived
as
a
dog
when
i
see
artifice
feel
gay
you
do
know
with
what
interest
you
have
been
awaited
we
ah
yes
and
were
you
pleased
to
come
we
did
not
know
to
what
we
were
coming
and
now
she
looked
round
the
table
peacefully
listened
to
the
light
voices
talking
a
french
she
had
never
heard
at
bar
and
now
i
could
not
make
you
understand
how
different
no
she
would
not
tell
him
how
they
had
lived
at
bar
she
was
ashamed
but
as
she
was
answering
the
servant
gave
him
a
message
and
he
was
called
away
when
he
returned
he
said
the
commandant
dormans
is
showing
himself
very
anxious
the
jew
laughed
and
said
he
wants
to
see
these
ladies
this
evening
no
he
spares
them
that
knowing
of
their
journey
he
sends
a
message
by
the
capitaine
châtel
to
tell
us
that

dinner
over
the
young
jew
reherrey
having
sent
for
two
cars
from
the
garage
drove
the
tired
englishwomen
to
their
billets
as
the
cars
passed
down
the
cobbled
streets
and
over
a
great
bridge
fanny
saw
water
gleam
in
the
gulf
below
what
river
is
that
the
moselle
a
sentry
challenged
them
on
the
far
side
of
the
bridge
now
we
are
in
the
outer
town
the
german
quarter
in
a
narrow
street
whose
houses
overhung
the
river
each
of
the
section
was
put
down
at
a
different
doorway
given
a
paper
upon
which
was
inscribed
her
right
to
billets
and
introduced
in
reherry
rapid
german
to
her
landlady
fanny
in
her
turn
following
the
young
man
through
a
dark
doorway
found
herself
in
a
stone
alley
and
climbed
the
windings
of
a
stairway
a
girl
of
twelve
or
thirteen
received
her
on
the
upper
landing
saying
guten
abend
and
looking
at
her
with
wonder
where
is
your
mother
said
reherry

eldest
sister

jawohl

away
and
ran
down
the
stairs
elsa
showed
fanny
to
a
room
prepared
for
her

elsa
and

not
take
her

of
this
room

the
strangers
room
said
elsa
i
thank
you
when
she
had
gone
fanny
looked
round
the
room
it
was
too
german
to
be
true
the
walls
were
dark
red
the
curtains
dark
red
the
carpet
eiderdown
rep
cover
of
the
armchair
plush
on
the
photograph
frames
embroidered
mats
upon
the
washstand
tiles
upon
the
stove
everything
a
deep
dark
red
four
mugs
stood
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
she
rubbed
her
eyes
was
it
possible
that
one
had
an
iron
cross
upon
its
porcelain
one
the
legend
got
mit
uns
the
third
the
head
of
the
kaiser
the
fourth
the
head
of
the
kaiserin
that
is
too
much
the
people
i
shall
write
to
wo
believe
it
her
bed
was
overhung
by
a
large
branch
of
stag
horn
fixed
upon
the
wall
she
felt
the
bed
counted
the
blankets
found
matches
on
the
mantelpiece
a
candle
in
the
candlestick
room
in
the
stove
to
boil
a
kettle
or
a
saucepan
hot
water
steamed
from
her
jug
a
hot
brick
had
been
placed
to
warm
her
bed
a
plate
of
rye
bread
cut
in
slices
and
covered
with
a
cloth
was
upon
the
table
foreign
to
her
own
the
eyes
which
had
rejoiced
in
this
room
yet
the
smile
of
german
comfort
was
upon
it
she
lay
down
beneath
the
branching
antlers
and
smiled
before
she
went
to
sleep
one
pair
of
silk
stockings
to
dance
in
babylon
in
the
morning
a
thin
woman
dressed
in
black
brought
her
breakfast
jam
rye
bread
coffee
and
sugar
guten
morgen
said
the
woman
and
looked
at
her
curiously
but
fanny
could
remember
which
language
she
ought
to
talk
and
fumbled
in
her
head
so
long
that
the
woman
went
away
she
dressed
and
went
out
meeting
stewart
by
her
doorway
together
they
crossed
the
bridge
the
theatre
square
and
went
towards
the
cathedral
with
eager
faces
they
did
not
look
up
at
the
cathedral
at
the
statute
of
old
david
upon
which
the
kaiser
had
had
his
own
head
carved
and
upon
whose
crossed
hands
the
people
had
now
hung
chains
fastened
with
a
padlock
they
did
not
glance
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
in
the
square
beyond
but
avoiding
the
tram
which
emerged
from
the
narrow
serpenoise
like
a
monster
that
had
too
long
been
oppressed
they
hurried
on
up
the
street
with
a
subdued
and
hungry
gaiety
there
was
a
need
to
be
satisfied
before
anything
could
be
seen
done
or
said
a
need
four
years
old
now
knocking
at
the
doors
of
heaven
howling
to
be
satisfied
before
the
windows
of
a
shop
they
paused
but
stewart
standing
back
and
looking
up
the
street
said
there
is
a
better
further
on
and
when
they
had
gone
on
a
few
paces
fanny
whispered
hurrying
a
better
still
beyond
at
the
third
shop
the
need
imperative
royal
would
wait
no
longer
and
drove
them
within
how
many
asked
the
saleswoman
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
seven
and
a
cream
bun
said
stewart
just
nine
said
fanny
seventeen
francs
said
the
woman
without
moving
an
eyelash
this
frenzy
cooled
their
pockets
lighter
they
walked
for
pleasure
in
the
town
the
narrow
streets
streamed
with
people
french
soldiers
and
officers
lorraine
women
in
the
costumes
of
pageantry
and
german
children
who
cried
shrilly
amerikanerin
amerikanerin
an
english
major
passed
them
they
recognised
his
flawless
boots
before
they
realised
his
nationality
and
following
his
the
worst
boots
in
the
world
worn
by
a
couple
of
sauntering
italian
officers
gay
in
olive
and
silver
uniform
german
men
in
black
slouch
hats
hurried
along
the
streets
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
should
eat
their
meals
in
a
room
overlooking
the
canal
at
the
foot
of
the
cathedral
and
there
at
eleven
they
went
to
be
a
little
dashed
in
spirit
by
the
reappearance
of
the
crockery
the
same
yellow
dish
carried
what
seemed
the
same
rationed
jam
the
square
blocks
of
meat
might
have
been
cooked
in
the
bar
and
brought
with
them
over
the
desert
two
heavy
loaves
stood
as
usual
on
the
wooden
table
the
french
army
ration
was
the
same
in
every
town
mesdames
said
the
orderly
assigned
to
them
there
are
two
without
who
wish
to
speak
with
you
let
them
come
in
two
blue
figures
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
saluted
the
first
brought
a
card
of
invitation
from
the
commandant
dormans
the
second
was
the
brigadier
from
the
garage
with
a
list
of
the
cars
assigned
to
the
drivers
perhaps
these
ladies
would
come
down
and
try
their
cars
after
lunch
he
suggested
and
lunch
being
over
they
walked
with
him
through
the
winding
streets
at
the
gates
of
a
great
yard
he
paused
and
a
sentry
swung
them
open
behind
the
gates
lay
a
sandy
plain
as
large
as
a
parade
ground
which
except
for
gulleys
or
gangways
crossing
it
at
intervals
was
packed
from
end
to
end
with
row
after
row
of
cars
cars
in
the
worst
possible
condition
torn
twisted
wheelless
cars
with
less
dramatic
and
yet
fatal
injuries
some
squatting
backwards
upon
their
haunches
some
inclined
forwards
upon
their
knees
one
lately
fished
up
from
a
river
had
slabs
and
crusts
of
ice
still
upon
its
seats
one
the
last
dragged
in
at
the
tail
of
a
breakdown
lorry
hung
in
the
air
helpless
upon

the

lining
all
one
side
of

ran
a
shed
closed
and
warmed
and
lighted
where
living
cars
slept
in
long
rows
mudguard
to
mudguard
and
bright
lamps
facing
outward
as
the
englishwomen
walked
in
a
soft
rustle
could
be
heard
up
and
down
the
lighted
shed
for
each
driver
working
by
his
car
turned
and
shot
a
glance
expectant
and
mocking
towards
the
door

filled
the

the

chilling
the

of
the

adventuring
upon
the

will
be
too
heavy
for
you
but
we
must
see
the
lieutenant
who
had
been
at
dinner
the
night
before
entered
the
shed
greeted
them
and
turned
to
stewart

said
stiffly
conscious
of
the
ears
which
listened
in
the
shed

if
you
can
start
her
now
mademoiselle
said
the
arranging
the
levers
there
was
a
still
hush
in
the
shed
as
stewart
bent
to
the
handle
fanny
standing
by
the
rochet
which
had
been
assigned
to
her
felt
her
heart
thumping

seizing

in

of
the

the
lights
shone
on

on

on

ridiculous

looking

there
was
a
spurt
of
life
from
the
engine
as
it
and
stewart
sprang
away
holding
her
wrist
with
the
other
hand
the
lieutenant
the
brigadier
and
a
driver
from
a

near
by
crowded
round
her
with
exclamations

scowling
at

room
she
caught
the
handle
with
her
injured
hand
and
with
a
gasp
swung
the
rochet
into
throbbing
life
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
down
the
shed
and
each
man
with
a
slight
movement
returned
to
the
work
he
had
been
doing
the

polished
the
cleaners

and
a
little
chink
of

and

sank
out
of

out
in
the
streets
the
lamps
woke
one
by
one
and
from
the
town
came
shouts
and
the
stamp
of
feet
marching
it
was
saturday
night
and
a
torchlight
procession
of
soldier
and
civilians
wound
down
the
street
the
band
passed
first
and
after
it
men
carried
fastened
upon
sticks
the
garage
gates
turned
to
rods
and
bars
of
gold
till
the
light
left
them
and
the
glare
upon
the
opposite
travelled
slowly
down
the
street
fanny
slipped
out
of
the
yard
and
crept
along
behind
the
flares
like
a
shadow
on
the
pavement
at
the
street
corner
she
passed
out
on
to
the
bridge
over
the
moselle
and
leant
against
the
stonework
to
watch
the
plumes
of
fire
as
they
glittered
up
the
riverside
upon
the
the
lights
vanished
leaving
the
darkness
so
intense
that
she
could
only
feel
her
way
over
the
bridge
by
holding
to
the
stonework
with
her
hand
a
sentry
challenged
her
and
when
she
had
passed
him
she
had
arrived
at
the
door
of
her
german
lodging
climbing
the
stairs
a
slow
breeze
of
excitement
filled
out
the
sails
of
her
spirit
my
silk
stockings
my
gold
links
and
my
benzene
bottle
she
murmured
happily
now
that
of
all
her
life
she
had
the
slenderest
toilet
to
make
three
hours

she

julien
earth
has
her
usual
delights
which
can
be
met
with
six
days
out
of
the
seven
but
here
and
there
upon
grey
earth
there
exist
like
the
flying
of
sunlight
celestial
pleasures
also
and
one
of
these
is
the
heaven
of
success
when
and
glorious
the
successful
creature
struts
like
a
peacock
gilded
in
a
passing
radiance
and
in
a
radiance
in
a
magic
illumination
the
newcomers
danced
in
the
of
the
commandant
dormans
and
tasted
that
which
can
not
be
found
when
sought
nor
held
when
tasted
old
tapestries
of
tropical
foliage
hung
around
the
walls
dusk
upon
one
wall
dawn
upon
another
trees
climbed
from
floor
to
ceiling
laden
with
flowers
with
birds
instead
of
fruits
upon
the
branches
when
at
a
touch
the
yellow
dust
flew
out
under
the
lamplight
it
seemed
to
the
mazy
eye
of
the
dancer
that
the
trees
sent
up
a
mist
of
pollen
and
song
in
this
happy
summer
fanny
turning
her
vain
ear
to
spoken
flattery
her
vain
eye
to
mute
danced
like
a
golden
gnat
in
fine
weather
the
commandant
dormans
spoke
to
her
if
he
was
not
young
he
had
a
quick
voice
that
was
not
old
he
said
we
welcome
you
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
we
are
glad
you
have
come
faces
surrounded
her
which
to
her
fresh
eyes
were
not
easy
to
read
names
which
she
had
heard
last
night
became
young
and
old
men
to
her
skins
red
and
pale
and
eyes
blue
and
olive
and
black
gay
audacious
and
mocking
features
she
was
dazzled
she
did
not
hurry
to
understand
one
could
not
choose
one
floated
free
of
preference
all
men
were
strangers
one
day
i
shall
know
what
they
are
how
they
live
how
they
think
but
she
did
not
want
that
day
to
come
the
commandant
dormans
said
you
do
not
regret
no
no
no
i
hear
you
are
all
voracious
for
work
i
hear
that
if
you
do
not
drive
from
morning
to
night
we
can
not
hope
to
keep
you
with
us
denis
said
to
her
be
careful
of
him
he
believes
there
is
no
end
to
the
human
strength
she
replied
joyously
there
is
no
end
to
our
strength
when
she
had
eyes
to
see
to
watch
to
choose
she
found
that
there
was
in
the
room
a
man
who
was
graceful
and
young
whose
eyes
were
a
peculiar
shape
who
laughed
all
the
time
gently
as
he
danced
he
never
looked
at
her
never
came
near
her
this
young
man
was
indifferent
to
her
he
was
indifferent
to
her
soon
he
became
a
trouble
and
a
pleasure
to
her
with
whom
was
he
dancing
now
and
now
who
was
it
that
amused
him
his
eyes
and
his
hair
were
bright
but
there
were
many
around
her
whose
eyes
and
hair
were
as
bright
before
she
had
seen
that
young
man
laugh
her
pleasure
had
been
more
complete
while
she
was
talking
to
denis
a
voice
said
to
her
wo
you
dance
with
me
looking
up
she
saw
who
it
was
his
mouth
smiled
his
eyes
were
clever
and
gay
the
moment
she
danced
with
him
she
began
to
grow
proud
she
began
to
find
herself
someone
whispered
to
her
the
section
must
leave
at
such
and
such
an
hour
she
thought
in
a
flash
for
me
the
section
is
dissolved
i
am
i
and
the
others
are
the
others
the
evening
wore
on
the
musicians
flagged
and
took
up
their
courage
again
it
was
late
when
stewart
touching
fanny
arm
showed
her
that
they
were
almost
the
only
two
women
in
the
room
where
are
the
others
in
the
hall
putting
on
their
coats
we
are
all
going
are
they
in
a
hurry
they
have
had
orders
which
were
brought
up
just
now
for
runs
early
morning
but
you
and
i
have
nothing
and
denis
has
asked
us
if
you
are
quick
you
can
slip
away
to
have
supper
with
him
at
moitriers
well
we
can
the
others
go
home
in
two
cars
which
have
been
sent
for
us
no
one
will
know
that
we
are
not
in
the
other
car
i
so
hungry
so
am
i
starving
very
well
they
joined
the
others
put
on
their
coats
hunted
ostentatiously
for
their
gloves
then
slipped
ahead
down
the
dark
stairway
into
the
square
below
denis
joined
them
splendid
i
have
my
car
round
that
corner
it
will

only
a
matter

an
hour

i
you

said
fanny
sniffing
at
the
frosty
air
at
the
fresh
night
whom

then
i
wo
be
a
moment
i
bring
whom
i

monsieur
as
he
reached
the
corner
he
turned
back
there
is
an
artillery
captain
in
a
black
uniform
with
silver
an
artillery
captain
he
paused
enquiringly
in
black
and
silver
there
was
no
other
in
the
room
oh
yes
there
were
two
in
black
and
silver
tall
with
ah

other
is
very
short
the
tall
one
is
the
aide
captain
chatêl
he
may
not
be
able
but
i
will
see
he
disappeared
again
when
he
returned
he
had
the
young
man
beside
him
one
moment
said
châtel
as
they
walked
towards
the
car
who
asked
for
me
the
girl
with
the
fair
hair
or
with
the
dark
with
the
fair
moitriers
was
closed
when
they
reached
it
and
they
drove
on
to
the
only
other
place
where
food
could
be
bought
past
the
hour
of
midnight
the
station
buffet
pushing
past
the
barriers
at
the
entrance
to
the
station
they
entered
a
long
corridor
filled
with
heavy
civilian
life
men
and
women
lay
slept
and
snored
upon
the
stone
ledges
which
lined
the
side
of
the
tunnel
their
bags
and
packets
stacked
around
them
small
children
lay
asleep
like
cut
corn
heads
hanging
and
nodding
in
all
directions
or
propped
against
each
other
in
such
an
intricate
combination
that
if
one
should
move
the
whole
sheaf
of
tired
heads
slipped
lower
to
the
floor
further
on
swing
doors
of
glass
led
to
a
and
here
the
sleeping
men
and
women
were
so
packed
upon
the
ground
and
around
the
little
tables
that
it
was
difficult
to
walk
between
them
men
sat
in
groups
of
nine
or
ten
around
a
table
meant
for
four
each
with
his
head
sunk
down
between
his
hands
upon
the
marble
surface
on
one
table
a
small
child
wrapped
in
shawls
lay
among
the
circle
of
heads
curled
like
a
snail
its
toe
in
its
father
ear
at
each
end
of
the
room
stood
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
denis
paused
at
the
entrance
walk
round
here
he
said
there
is
a
gangway
for
the
sentry
if
we
talk
too
loud
said
fanny
we
shall
wake
them
they
must
soon
wake
in
any
case
it
must
be
near
the
time
for
the
train
you
know
who
they
are
who
germans
expelled
from
metz
they
leave
in
batches
for
germany
every
night
by
a
train
that
comes
in
and
goes
out
at
some
horrible
hour
passing
through
more
glass
doors
they
came
to
an
inner
room
where
behind
a
buffet
a
lady
in
black
silk
served
them
with
beer
and
slices
of
raw
ham
and
bread
the
four
sat
down
for
a
moment
at
a
little
table
denis
talking
of
the
system
by
which
the
outgoing
germans
were
nightly
weeded
from
those
who
had
permission
to
remain
behind
in
metz
julien
châtel
joined
in
the
conversation
he
spoke
with
the
others
but
he
glanced
at
fanny
for
the
briefest
of
seconds
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
face
that
he
saw
a
new
interest
smile
upon
it
he
did
not
know
that
his
own
face
wore
the
same
look
his
look
said
as
he
looked
at
her
you
you
you
at
one
moment
she
thought
am
i
pretty
at
the
next
she
was
content
only
to
breathe
and
thought
no
more
of
herself
she
took
in
now
his
eyes
which
seldom
rested
on
her
now
a
movement
of
his
lips
which
made
her
feel
both
happy
and
miserable
and
suddenly
she
learnt
how
often
his
finger
traced
some
letter
upon
his
cheek
these
things
were
important
they
were
like
the
opening
sentences
of
a
great
play
to
which
one
must
listen
absorbed
for
fear
of
misunderstanding
all
the
story
it
was
not
long
before
they
rose
threaded
their
way
back
between
the
sleeping
germans
regained
the
car
and
drove
down
the
silent
streets
towards
the
cathedral
have
you
seen
it
said
julien
in
a
low
voice
addressing
her
directly
the
cathedral
yes
i
want
to
show
it
to
you
will
you
meet
me
there
at
three
the
others
talked
and
smiled
and
knew
nothing
whoever
has
a
secret
is
stronger
than
they
who
know
nothing
fanny
thought
my
companions
to
be
as
you
are
is
not
to
exist
whatever
you
feel
you
are
feeling
nothing
will
you
yes
she
answered
and
joined
her
hands
tightly
for
this
was
where
the
play
really
began
the
sun
shone
gaily
here
was
no
mud
no
unhappiness
here
were
no
puzzled
women
and
touching
mayors
of
ruined
villages
but
instead
gay
goblin
houses
pointed
churches
like
sugar
cake
the
old
french
theatre
with
its
stone
garlands
glittering
in
the
sun
sun
everywhere
streaming
over
the
place
du
théâtre
over
women
shaking
coloured
rags
from
the
windows
women
washing
linen
by
the
river
everything
that
had
been
wet
was
drying
everything
that
had
savoured
of
tears
and
age
and
sadness
was
burning
up
under
the
sun
and
what
moisture
remained
was
brighter
than
jewels
suppose
he
never
came
why
then
be
ready
for
that
very
likely
he
would
come
very
likely
he
would
think
in
daylight
she
is
not
a
woman
but
an
english
amazon
fanny
glanced
down
at
her
clothes
regretfully
she
was
for
an
assignation
at
least
i
might
have
better
gloves
she
thought
and
walked
into
a
small
shop
which
advertised
men
clothes
in
german
across
the
window
she
bought
yellow
gloves
at
francs
a
pair
and
would
have
paid
a
hundred
had
the
salesman
insisted
and
now
with
yellow
gloves
silk
stockings
shining
shoes
and
a
heart
as
light
as
a
leaf
upon
a
wind
she
walked
towards
the
cathedral
he
wo
come
he
wo
be
there
she
pushed
at
the
east
door
he
was
under
a
madonna
his
black
and
silver
hat
in
his
hand
his
eyes
critical
and
pleased
as
he
walked
to
meet
her
they
sat
down
together
on
a
seat
without
speaking
then
each
longing
for
the
other
to
speak
you
have
come
he
said
first
his
face
was
oval
and
his
hair
was
shining
yes
she
nodded
and
noticed
a
peculiar
glory
in
the
cathedral
the
dark
cave
shone
as
white
flesh
and
youth
can
shine
through
the
veils
of
a
mourner
they
no
longer
lived
their
own
separate
lives
they
had
come
together
at
each
other
call
i
thought
you
would
come
why
why
did
you
think
that
little
questions
and
little
answers
fell
in
a
sudden
rain
from
their
lips
yet
while
fanny
spoke
he
did
not
seem
to
know
what
she
said
and
answered
at
random
or
sometimes
he
did
not
answer
at
all
but
smiled
afraid
of
the
fragile
avowal
of
silence
evading
it
she
found
little
words
to
follow
one
another
but
he
answered
less
and
less
and
smiled
at
her
till
his
face
was
full
of
this
smile
so
then
she
said
go
out
and
walk
by
the
river
and
he
rose
at
once
and
followed
her
among
the
forest
of
wooden
chairs
they
forgot
that
he
was
to
have
shown
her
the
cathedral
in
all
its
length
she
never
saw
one
statue
except
the
first
madonna
not
one
stone
face
but
his
young
face
with
the
cold
light
upon
it
his
hands
as
white
as
stones
as
long
and
fine
as
any
of
the
carved
fingers
which
prayed
around
them
they
walked
together
down
the
winding
path
below
the
bridge
to
the
very
edge
of
the
moselle
which
lay
in
light
winter
sunlight
its
banks
buried
in
shrubberies
of
green
mont
quentin
conical
covered
with
waving
trees
shone
like
a
hill
in
summer
and
beyond
it
the
indigo
forest
of
every
lorraine
horizon
floated
indefinitely
like
a
cloud
a
young
doctor
lounged
beside
them
under
his
red
plush
cap
why
are
all
doctors
plain
in
france
she
laughed
hush
he
wound
his
hand
round
and
round
like
the
player
of
a
barrel
i
have
to
stop
you
when
you
say
silly
things
like
a
phonograph
at
so
much
a
metre
so
he
believed
he
might
tease
her
delighted
she
stopped
by
the
bank
of
the
river
and
stared
into
the
water
the
sun
ran
over
her
shoulders
and
warmed
her
hands
the
still
shine
of
the
river
held
both
their
eyes
as
movement
in
a
train
holds
the
mind
i
am
enjoying
my
walk
he
said
he
did
not
mean
it
like
that
or
as
a
compliment
to
her
when
it
was
said
he
thought
it
sounded
banal
and
was
sorry
what
a
pity
but
she
was
not
critical
because
she
was
looking
for
living
happiness
and
every
moment
she
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
she
would
get
it
but
when
he
asked
her
her
name
and
she
repeated
it
it
sounded
so
much
like
an
avowal
that
they
both
turned
together
down
the
with
a
quick
movement
and
spoke
of
other
things
for
they
were
old
enough
to
be
afraid
that
the
vague
happiness
that
fluttered
before
them
down
the
path
would
not
be
so
beautiful
when
it
was
caught
and
at
this
fear
she
said
distinctly
to
herself
in
love
and
wondered
that
she
had
not
said
it
before
coming
back
to
him
with
her
words
she
then
began
to
wound
and
to
delay
him
you
must
be
late
for
your
office
when
shall
i
see
you
again
they
dropped
into
a
long
silence
she
summoned
her
coquetry
that
she
called
pride
the
blue
blue
forest
at
the
edge
of
her
sight
tilted
a
little
like
a
ship
the
watery
rolled
towards
it
in
mysterious
kilometres
it
is
beautiful
she
said
clumsily
avoiding
his
question
ignoring
it
yet
when
i
go
there
it
is
always
more
beautiful
on
the
next
hill
i
must
hurry
he
said
at
once
i
shall
be
late
at
my
office
where
is
your
office
he
looked
round
vaguely
there
in
that
group
of
pines
they
walked
towards
it
they
were
almost
at
the
door
but
he
would
not
repeat
his
question
would
he
not
at
the
last
moment
no
had
it
not
then
been
clear
that
the
living
happiness
was
at
her
lips
no
could
he
let
her
go
could
it
have
been
a
failure
he
was
holding
out
one
of
the
stone
hands
he
was
going
she
looked
up
and
the
sun
was
streaming
in
his
eyes
blinding
him
and
without
seeing
her
he
stared
into
the
darkness
that
was
her
face
i
have
so
enjoyed
my
walk
he
said
thank
you
for
coming
all
her
face
said
oh
in
a
hurt
frightened
stare
but
the
sun
only
came
round
the
edges
of
her
hair
and
cap
and
left
the
panic
in
a
shifting
darkness
he
was
gone
she
went
back
to
her
street
reaching
the
big
populous
house
she
followed
the
corridor
that
led
from
the
stone
courtyard
climbed
to
the
first
floor
and
opened
the
door
of
her
own
room
a
bitter
disillusion
ran
through
her
the
furniture
seemed
to
say
indifferently
there
not
much
room
for
you
and
she
knew
quite
well
as
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
that
it
was
not
her
room
at
all
but
had
been
as
public
to
the
birds
of
passage
as
the
branch
of
a
tree
to
the
birds
of
the
air
i
did
so
little
i
did
so
little
it
was
such
a
little
mistake
flooded
her
and
why
did
he
ask
me
to
come
to
the
cathedral
if
such
a
little
thing
such
a
little
thing
indignation
rose
things
do
crumble
like
that
do
vanish
like
that
she
stared
astonished
at
the
scenes
she
had
left
behind
her
the
shining
of
the
dark
cathedral
the
ripple
on
the
moselle
but
they
do
they
do
they
do
down
in
the
street
her
own
name
caught
her
ear
and
she
went
to
the
window
are
you
there
are
you
there
cried
the
voice
hanging
out
of
the
window
she
received
her
orders
for
the
next
day
i
came
down
to
tell
you
now
said
the
girl
below
on
the
pavement
i
thought
you
might
have
things
to
do
to
the
car
you
must
be
at
the
hôtel
royal
near
the
station
at
six
morning
have
you
any
idea
whom
i
to
take
or
where
i
do
know
where
but
the
man
is
a
russian
colonel
she
drew
her
head
back
through
the
window
and
the
gay
tumble
of
the
street
gave
way
to
the
impersonal
heavy
room
cramming
her
overall
into
her
haversack
she
put
on
her
leather
coat
and
went
up
to
the
garage
the
sun
had
disappeared
a
cold
wind
struck
the
ankles

she
said
in
english
lifting
her
head
and
all
her
mind
and
spirit
out
of
the
pit
of
the
pillow
feet
came
further
into
the
room
and
a
shivering
child
held
a
candle
in
her
face
halb

fräulein
it
said
but
the
fräulein
continued
to
stare
at
him
he
thought
she
was
not
yet
awake
he
could
not
tell
that
she
was
counting
countries
in
her
head
to
find
which
one
she
was
in
or
that
she
was
inclining
towards
the
theory
that
she
was
at
school
in
germany
he
was
very
cold
in
his
shirt
and
little
trousers
and
he
pulled
at
her
sheets
fräulein
he
said
again
with
chattering
teeth
and
when
she
nodded
more
collectedly
the
little
ghost
slipped
out
relieved

the
door
russian

i
must
get
up

why
could
someone
older
i
must
get
up
he
had
left
the
electric
light
burning
in
her
room
but
out
in
the
corridor
all
was
black
and
hushed
as
she
had
left
it
the
night
before
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
behind
the
kitchen
door
there
was
a
noise
of
water
running
in
the
sink
she
opened
the
door
and
there
was
the
wretched
child
again
still
in
his
shirt
rinsing
out
her
by
the
light
of
one
candle
well
since
he
was
doing
it
poor
child
but
she
must
have
her
coffee
by
the
time
she
was
dressed
he
tapped
again
and
brought
in
the
tray
with
coffee
bread
and
jam
on
it
setting
it
down
he
looked
it
over
with
an
anxious
face
zucker
he
said
and
disappeared
to
fetch
it
she
filled
her
thermos
bottle
with
the
rest
of
the
coffee
which
she
could
not
finish
and
put
two
of
the
slices
of
grey
bread
into
the
haversack
then
crept
downstairs
and
out
into
the
black
street
where
the
gas
lamps
still
burnt
and
the
night
sentry
still
paced
up
and
down
in
the
spectral
gloom
over
the
river
hung
a
woolly
fog
imprisoning
the
water
but
as
she
crossed
the
bridge
she
noticed
where
its
solidity
was
incomplete
and
torn
and
into
the
dark
water
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
such
crevasses
a
lamp
upon
the
bridge
struck
its
arrowed
likeness
it
was
a
good
seven
minutes
walk
to
the
garage
and
she
tried
to
get
warm
by
running
but
the
ice
crackling
in
the
gutters
and
between
the
cobble
stones
defied
her
and
her
hands
ached
with
cold
though
she
put
them
in
turn
right
through
her
blouse
against
her
heart
to
warm
them
as
she
ran
fetching
her
car
she
drove
to
the
hôtel
royal
and
settled
down
to
wait
a
porter
came
out
and
swept
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
a
puff
of
his
dust
caught
her
in
the
face
he
laid
a
fibre
mat
on
each
stone
step
and
clipped
them
with
little
metal
clips
are
you
for
us
asked
a
looking
first
up
and
down
the
empty
street
and
then
at
the
car
he
had
blue
eyes
and
a
long
sad
moustache
that
swept
down
the
lower
half
of
his
face
and
even
below
his
chin
making
him
look
older
than
he
should
i
am
for
a
russian
colonel
she
said
liking
his
mild
face
that
right
yes
a
russian
colonel
colonel
dellahousse
but
can
you
manage
by
yourself
can
you
really
i
will
tell
him
he
disappeared
up
the
steps
and
through
the
swing
door
of
the
hotel
a
moment
later
he
was
out
again
he
will
come
to
you
himself
he
will
see
you
but
we
want
to
go
to
verdun
could
you
drive
so
far
you
could
yes
yes
perhaps
yet
here
he
comes
in
dark
civilian
clothes
the
russian
came
down
the
hotel
steps
he
was
tall
serious
upright
rich
his
face
beneath
his
wide
black
hat
was
grave
and
well
cared
for
the
sombre
glitter
of
his
eye
was
grave
his
small
dark
beard
shone
in
the
prime
of
its
growth
from
the
narrow
line
of
white
collar
to
the
narrower
thread
of
french
watchchain
from
the
lean
long
feet
to
the
lean
white
hands
she
took
him
in
and
braced
herself
adjusted
herself
to
meet
his
stately
gravity
if
there
was
something
of
the
mephistopheles
in
fancy
dress
about
him
it
was
corrected
by
his
considerate
expression
have
you
had
breakfast
he
began
speaking
french
with
a
softly
nasal
accent
how
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
yes
thank
you
monsieur
i
have
to
go
to
verdun
he
put
it
to
her
i
have
business
there
it
was
as
though
he
expected
that
she
would
let
him
off
without
difficult
explanations
would
exclaim
there
is
some
mistake
some
other
car
some
other
driver
is
intended
for
your
work
but
she
remained
silent
except
for
a
smile
of
acknowledgment
and
with
a
sigh
he
summoned
the
lieutenant
and
went
back
into
the
hotel
in
a
few
minutes
the
frenchman
came
out
again
monsieur
dellahousse
would
like
to
know
if
you
know
the
way
he
inquired
he
does
want
to
take
me
is
that
it
asked
fanny
smiling
but
anxious
he
is
a
little
doubtful
admitted
the
lieutenant
you
must
excuse
perhaps
i
appear
flippant
to
him
but
i
am
grave
too
grave
as
he
and
i
long
to
go
and
the
car
and
i
we
are
trustworthy
i
do
indeed
know
the
way
to
verdun
he
went
in
again
and
for
answer
the
porter
brought
out
the
bags
and
colonel
dellahousse
followed
carrying
a
sealed
black
bag
with
care
under
his
arm
she
was
sure
he
had
said
to
the
frenchman
but
what
sort
of
a
woman
is
she
one
does
not
want
to
have
difficulties
and
as
sure
too
that
the
other
had
answered
i
know
the
english
they
let
their
women
do
this
sort
of
thing
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
she
no
longer
felt
defiant
towards
the
spoken
and
unspoken
criticism
she
met
everywhere
what
kind
of
women
can
these
be
whose
men
allow
them
to
drive
alone
with
us
for
hours
and
sometimes
days
but
had
begun
to
apologise
for
it
even
to
herself
while
it
sometimes
caused
her
bewilderment
she
drove
them
back
through
the
waking
town
and
out
by
the
verdun
gates
and
soon
up
on
to
the
steep
heights
above
the
town
among
frozen
fields
and
grasslands
white
with
frost
the
big
stone
tombs
of
stuck
out
of
a
light
ground
fog
like
sails
upon
a
grey
sea
and
it
was
not
long
at
jeandelize
before
the
graves
began
small
isolated
wooden
crosses
they
touched
the
brink
of
the
battlefields
a
rain
of
dead
gunfire
began
along
the
sides
of
the
road
with
hairy
edges
of
dried
thistles
and
at
the
bottom
of
each
green
moss
stiffened
with
ice
the
road
grew
wilder
and
wilder
and
took
on
the
air
of
a
moor
mile
after
mile
of
grey
stricken
grass
old
iron
and
large
upturned
stones
wherever
a
pair
of
blasted
trees
was
left
at
the
side
a
notice
hung
in
on
wires
slung
from
tree
to
tree
across
the
road

shouted
the
square
black

from
the
boards
which
swung
and
creaked
in
the
wind

said
the
monster
black

painted
on

and
stone
pointing
thick
black
and
steady
till
it
seemed
that
the
ghost
of
the
german
endeavour
still
flung
itself
along
the
road
nach

nach
verdun
without
a
pause
with
head
down
nach

so
that
no
one
might
go
wrong
go
aside
go
astray
turn
back
against
the
order
of
the
arrow
not
an
arrow
anywhere
answered
nach

for
miles
and
miles
nothing
living
was
to
be
seen
neither
animal
nor
motor
nor
living
man
only
the
stray
fires
of
the
chinese
fluttered
here
and
there
like
blue
and
red
marsh
fires
a
mile
or
so
back
from
the
main
road
once
as
she
flew
along
she
shied
like
a
horse
and
twisted
the
wheel
as
a
wild
screaming
and
twittering
rose
at
the
side
of
the
car
and
glancing
back
she
saw
three
figures
wriggle
and
laugh
in
mockery
and
astonishment
they
had
risen
round
the
embers
of
a
dead
fire
and
stood
swaying
on
their
feet
and
showing
white
teeth
in
orange
faces
one
had
the
long
hair
of
a
woman
flapping
about
his
ears
they
reached
etain
and
turned
the
sharp
corner
in
the
street
lined
with
hollow
houses
passed
under
a
tunnel
of
thick
camouflage
leafy
as
an
arbour
mouldy
as
the
rags
upon
a
corpse
and
came
on
the
first
of
the
hindenburg
line
another
twelve
miles
and
the
twin
towers
of
verdun
appeared
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
i
thought
it
but
dust
exclaimed
the
russian
i
thought
it
a
ruin
it
is
a
town
wait
wait
till
you
get
nearer
then
down
the
last
long
hill
and
over
the
paved
route
into
the
suburbs
of
verdun
as
they
neared
it
the
town
began
to
show
its
awful
frailty
its
appearance
of
preservation
was
a
mockery
verdun
stood
upright
as
by
a
miracle
a
coarse
lace
of
masonry
not
one
house
was
whole
stop
ordered
the
russian
and
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
conical
hill
which
wore
verdun
upon
its
crest
they
stopped
and
stared
the
town
was
poured
over
the
slopes
of
the
hill
as
though
a
titanic
tipcart
had
let
out
its
rubbish
upon
the
summit
houses
shops
and
churches
still
upright
still
formed
verdun
kept
its
shape
intact
unwilling
that
it
should
fall
to
dust
while
these
deadly
skeletons
could
keep
their
feet
light
glared
through
the
walls
and
upon
the
topmost
point
of
all
the
palace
of
the
bishop
was
balanced
its
bones
laced
against
the
sky
the
russian
who
had
stood
up
in
the
car
sat
down
now
go
on
the
streets
which
circled
the
base
of
the
hill
had
been
partially
cleared
of
fallen
rock
and
stonework
and
the
car
could
pick
its
way
between
the
crazy
where
notices
of
vanished
cobblers
manicurists
butchers
flapped
before
caverns
hollowed
by
fire
upon
fingers
of
stone
already
touched
by
moss
here
and
there
soldiers
moved
in
bands
at
their
work
of
clearing
but
the
black
hat
the
drab
coat
of
the
civilian
had
long
been
left
behind
and
here
the
face
of
a
woman
was
unknown
as
the
flying
dragons
of
the
world
youth
now
and
then
with
a
crash
the
remains
of
a
house
fell
as
the
block
of
stonework
which
alone
supported
it
was
disarranged
by
the
working
soldiers
where
am
i
to
go
asked
fanny
as
the
street
wound
round
the
base
of
the
hill
i
will
climb
over
beside
you
and
direct
you
said
the
french
lieutenant
and
dropped
into
the
front
seat
where
do
these
soldiers
sleep
not
among
these
ruins
a
block
of
masonry
fell
ahead
of
them
and
split
its
stones
across
the
street
be
careful
you
can
get
round
by
this
side
street
up
here
in
these
ruins
no
living
soul
can
sleep
in
verdun
now
where
then
do
you
know
they
sleep
verdun
in
this
hill
around
which
we
are
circling
i
am
looking
for
the
entrance
inside
this
hill
under
the
town
but
you
heard
of
the
yes
but
this
hill
is
so
big
there
are
fifteen
kilometres
of
tunnel
in
this
hollow
hill
and
hundreds
of
steps
lead
up
to
the
top
by
the
palace
where
there
is
a
defence
of
barbed
wire
and
guns
look
here
is
the
entrance
they
left
the
car
before
them
was
a
small
dark
hole
in
the
side
of
the
hill
an
entrance
not
much
higher
than
a
man
into
which
ran
a
single
rail
line
of
narrow
gauge
a
sentry
challenged
them
as
they
walked
towards
him
entering
the
hill
they
found
themselves
in
a
tunnel
lit
by
electric
bulbs
which
hung
in
a
dotted
line
ahead
of
them
wait
ordered
the
deep
voice
of
the
russian
and
he
strode
from
them
into
the
depths
of
the
tunnel
with
the
eastern
swing
of
ali
baba
entering
his
cave
fanny
stood
by
the
mild
lieutenant
and
they
waited
obediently
i
must
tell
you
a
secret
he
said
to
her
monsieur
dellahousse
is
very
glad
to
be
here
he
said
this
morning
governor
has
sent
me
a
woman
to
break
my
neck
but
he
took
me
could
he
refuse
you
for
he
felt
that
it
was
a
glove
of
challenge
thrown
down
by
the
governor
of
metz
they
do
not
get
on
together
he
took
you
with
dignity
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
placed
himself
in
the
jaws
of
death
when
do
we
go
back
we
can
not
now
be
in
metz
before
dark
but
have
they
told
you
never
warned
you
how
monstrous
we
are
staying
here
and
i
return
alone
no
you
stay
too
you
are
lent
to
us
for
five
days
they
should
have
told
you
oh
i
stay
too
in
this
tunnel
here
how
odd
how
amusing
monsieur
dellahousse
has
gone
to
ask
the
commandant
of
the
to
house
us
all
here
he
comes
the
russian
returned
under
the
chain
of
lights
follow
me
he
said
and
led
them
further
into
his
cavern
they
followed
him
like
children
and
as
they
advanced
the
lieutenant
whispered
we
are
now
well
beneath
the
town
it
lies
like
a
crust
above
our
heads
exactly
beneath
the
palace
you
will
see
the
steps
go
up
what
is
the
railway
line
for
bread
for
the
garrison
there
are
great
bakeries
in
the
further
and
further
still
till
the
russian
turned
to
the
right
and
took
a
branching
tunnel
here
lining
the
curve
of
the
stone
wall
were
twenty
little
cubicles
of
light
wood
raised
a
few
inches
from
the
moist
floor
and
roofless
except
for
the
arch
of
the
tunnel
that
ran
equally
above
them
all
these
were
the
rooms
assigned
to
the
de
officers
whom
duty
kept
for
a
night
in
verdun
each
cubicle
held
a
bed
a
tin
basin
on
a
tripod
a
minute
square
of
a
chair
and
a
shelf
and
each
bore
the
name
of
its
temporary
owner
written
on
a
card
upon
the
door
twenty
and
read
the
russian
from
a
paper
he
carried
and
threw
open
the
door
of
this
is
yours
mademoiselle
he
bowed
and
waved
her
toward
it
fanny
entered
the
room
which
from
his
manner
might
have
been
the
gilded
of
his
tzar
she
heard
him
enter
his
own
room
and
through
the
partition
the
very
sighing
of
his
breath
was
audible
as
it
rustled
upon
his
lips
he
tried
to
give
her
the
illusion
of
privacy
for
wishing
to
speak
to
her
he
left
his
room
again
to
tap
at
her
door
though
his
voice
was
as
near
her
ear
whether
at
door
or
wall
i
hope
you
are
content
mademoiselle
he
said
through
the
woodwork
delighted
monsieur
you
will
sleep
here
he
continued
as
though
he
suspected
her
of
sleeping
anywhere
but
there
and
dine
with
us
in
the
officers
mess
at
seven
until
then
please
stay
in
the
in
case
i
need
you
she
heard
his
footsteps
go
up
the
corridor
the
lieutenant
following
him
i
will
unpack
she
thought
and
from
her
knapsack
drew
what
she
had
by
chance
brought
with
her
upon
the
shelf
she
arranged
a
tin
of
the
french
bully
beef
a
gilt
box
of
powder
a
toothbrush
a
comb
a
map
a
packet
of
letters
to
be
answered
and
a
magneto
spanner
there
was
an
hour
yet
before
dinner
and
she
wandered
out
into
the
corridors
to
explore
the
a
soldier
stood
upon
a
ladder
changing
the
bulb
of
an
electric
light
catching
sight
of
her
he
hurried
from
his
ladder
and
passing
her
with
a
stiff
face
saluted
and
disappeared
soon
she
began
to
think
that
this
was
the
busy
hour
in
the
fortress
the
corridors
rustled
gently
the
unformed
whispering
of
voices
echoed
behind
her
the
walls
seemed
to
open
at
a
dozen
spots
as
she
walked
on
and
little
men
with
bright
grave
faces
hurried
past
her
about
their
duties
perhaps
they
are
changing
the
guard
yet
a
face
which
had
already
passed
her
three
times
began
to
impress
its
features
upon
her
and
she
realised
suddenly
that
it
was
curiosity
not
duty
that
called
the
soldiers
from
their
burrows
the
news
was
spreading
for
out
of
the
gloom
ahead
fresh
parties
of
onlookers
appeared
paused
disconcerted
as
she
wished
them
good
evening
nodded
or
saluted
her
in
haste
then
hurried
by
an
officer
with
grizzled
hair
stepped
into
the
passage
from
a
doorway
as
she
neared
him
she
saw
he
wore
the
badges
of
a
commandant
who
is
this
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
of
the
soldier
who
followed
at
his
heels
sais
rien
mon
commandant
the
soldier
stiffened
as
a
who
sees
a
cat
fanny
hastened
nearer
i
drive
a
russian
officer
she
explained
i
hope
i
have
your
permission
to
stay
here
ah
exclaimed
the
officer
looking
at
her
in
surprise
colonel
dellahousse
told
me
driver
he
did
not
add
that
the
driver
was
a
lady
where
have
they
put

the
cubicles
of
the
de
passage

the
room

the
bishop

he
is
absent
it
is
in
my
corridor
fanny
followed
him
and
noticed
that
the
corridor
was
now
clear
of
soldiers
the
commandant
paused
before
a
door
decorated
with
flags
and
led
her
into
another
corridor
lined
with
cubicles
much
larger
than
those
she
had
seen
at
first
open
number
seven
the
soldier
took
his
bunch
of
keys
and
opened
the
door
now

the
other
corridor

number

he
hastened
up
the
corridor
and
returned
with
the
book
in
his
hand
the
soldier
too
returned
bearing
the
seven
objects
which
had
accompanied
her
travels
you
will
clean
mademoiselle
shoes
brush
her
uniform
and
bring
her
hot
water
when
she
needs
it
ordered
the
commandant
and
the
soldier
saluted
impassively
a
who
had
been
told
that
it
was
the
after
all
left
alone
she
searched
all
her
pockets
for
some
forgotten
stick
of
chocolate
and
finding
nothing
sat
down
upon
the
bed
to
wait
hungrily
till
seven
the
air
in
the
tunnels
was
heavy
and
dry
and
throwing
off
her
tunic
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
slept
until
footsteps
passing
her
door
awoke
her
she
became
aware
that
the
inhabitants
of
her
corridor
were
washing
their
hands
for
dinner
and
sitting
up
sleepily
found
that
it
was
already
seven
in
a
few
minutes
she
hurried
from
her
room
and
out
into
the
main
tunnel
glad
to
get
nearer
the
fresh
air
which
filtered
in
through
the
opening
at
the
far
end
reaching
a
door
which
she
had
noticed
before
marked
she
paused
a
second
listening
to
the
hum
of
voices
within
then
pushed
at
the
door
and
entered
instantly
there
was
a
hush
of
astonishment
as
seventy
or
eighty
officers
eating
at
a
long
trestle
table
sharply
turned
their
heads
towards
her
their
forks
poised
for
a
second
their
hands
still
then
with
a
quick
recovery
all
was
as
before
and
the
stream
of
talk
flowed
on
the
first
section
of
the
table
was
reserved
for
strangers
passing
through
verdun
and
here
sat
a
party
of
young
russian
officers
in
light
an
american
or
two
and
a
few
french
officers
at
the
next
section
sat
the
officers
of
the
a
passing
general
and
at
the
left
hand
of
the
commandant
monsieur
dellahousse
and
the
mild
lieutenant
overhead
the
stone
roof
of
the
tunnel
was
arched
with
flags
and
orderlies
hurried
up
and
down
serving
the
diners
fanny
halfway
up
the
long
table
wavered
in
doubt
where
after
all
was
she
supposed
to
sit
at
the
top
section
as
a
guest
or
as
a
driver
among
the
whispering
russians
at
the
stranger
section
her
anxiety
showed
in
her
face
as
she
glanced
forwards
and
backwards
and
an
orderly
hurried
towards
her
par
ici
mademoiselle
par
ici
and
she
followed
him
towards
the
head
of
the
table
her
doubts
dissolved
as
she
saw
the
gap
left
for
her
by
the
friendly
arm
of
the
lieutenant
and
arrived
at
the
long
wooden
bench
upon
which
they
sat
she
bowed
to
the
commandant
and
lifting
one
leg
beneath
her
skirt
as
a
hen
does
beneath
its
feathers
she
straddled
the
difficult
bench
and
dropped
into
position
beer
mademoiselle
or
red
wine
asked
the
russian
suddenly
turning
to
her
and
the
commandant
released
from
his
conversation
called
out
gaily
the
mees
will
say
but
one
must
insist
take
the
wine
mees
it
is
better
for
you
the
idea
of
water
had
never
crossed
mind
but
having
decided
on
beer
she
changed
it
politely
to
red
wine
which
she
guessed
to
be
no
other
than
the
everlasting
i
know
them
continued
the
commandant
smiling
at
the
general
i
know
the
english
my
home
is
at
biarritz
and
there
one
meets
so
many
and
this
old
man
thus
addressed
a
great
star
blazing
on
his
breast
and
tears
of
age
trembling
in
his
blue
eyes
lifted
his
hand
to
attract
her
attention
and
said
to
fanny
in
gentle
english
verdun
honours
a
charming
guest
mademoiselle
verdun
honours
his
words
lingered
in
her
ear
she
a
guest
honoured
up
till
now
the
novelty
of
her
situation
had
engrossed
her
the
little
soldiers
watching
in
the
tunnels
the
commandant
so
eager
to
air
his
stumbling
english
these
had
amused
her
and
when
she
had
perceived
herself
rare
unique
she
had
forgotten
why
she
was
thus
rare
and
what
strange
romantic
life
she
meddled
in
here
in
this
womanless
region
in
this
fortress
in
this
room
night
after
night
month
after
month
the
commandant
and
his
officers
had
sat
at
table
in
this
room
which
unlike
the
tomb
had
held
only
the
living
while
the
dead
and
the
inhabited
the
earth
above
they
had
finished
dinner
and
monsieur
dellahousse
signalled
to
fanny
that
she
might
rise
she
rose
and
at
the
full
sight
of
her
uniform
he
remembered
her
duties
and
said
stiffly
be
good
enough
to
wait
up
till
ten
i
may
need
you
they
passed
out
again
down
the
length
of
the
tables
near
the
door
the
russian
paused
to
speak
with
his
countrymen
who
rose
and
stood
respectfully
round
him
fanny
and
the
lieutenant
went
on
alone
to
the
corridor
you
have
travelled
with
him
before
she
asked
oh
yes
i
am
lent
to
him
to
help
him
through
the
country
he
is
on
a
tour
of
inspection
for
the
red
cross
he
visits
all
the
camps
of
russian
prisoners
liberated
from
germany
but
are
there
many
round
verdun
thousands
you
will
see
and
be
prepared
for
early
rising
if
he
does
send
for
you
by
ten
i
will
tell
the
orderly
to
let
you
know
the
hour
at
which
you
will
be
wanted
morning
the
car
is
all
ready
to
start
again
i
am
going
out
to
her
now
he
turned
away
to
join
the
russian
and
fanny
passed
the
sentry
at
the
tunnel
mouth
and
stood
in
the
road
outside
verdun
by
night
verdun
by
starlight
awaited
her
up
the
slopes
of
the
hill
every
spar
brick
and
beam
carried
its
bristle
of
gold
at
her
own
head
imperceptible
movement
flashes
came
and
went
between
the
ribs
of
the
bishop
palace
the
sentry
by
the
tunnel
stood
between
the
upper
and
the
underground
with
his
left
eye
he
could
watch
the
lights
that
strung
back
into
the
hollow
hill
with
his
right
the
smiling
and
winking
of
the
stars
in
the
sky
fait
beau
dehors
his
voice
startled
her
she
turned
to
him
but
he
stood
immobile
in
the
shadow
as
though
he
had
never
spoken
she
could
not
be
sure
that
he
had
indicated
to
her
that
every
man
has
his
taste
and
his
choice
she
set
to
work
on
her
car
which
stood
in
the
shelter
of
an
archway
opposite
and
for
half
an
hour
the
sky
trembled
unregarded
above
her
head
when
she
had
finished
she
stood
back
and
gazed
at
the
rochet
with
an
anxious
friendly
enmity
the
friendship
of
an
infant
with
a
lion
the
garage
is
eighty
miles
away
she
sighed
with
its
friendly
men
who
know
all
where
i
know
so
little
ah
do
i
know
enough
what
have
i
left
undone
for
she
felt
what
was
the
truth
that
the
whole
expedition
depended
on
her
that
the
stately
russian
had
perhaps
never
known
what
it
was
to
have
a
breakdown
that
in
moscow
in
petrograd
in
his
faraway
life
he
had
sat
in
town
cars
behind
two
chauffeurs
unaware
of
the
deadly
traps
in
rubber
and
metal
chapter
v
verdun
night
was
the
same
as
day
in
the
tunnels
the
electric
light
was
always
on
and
with
the
morning
no
daylight
crept
in
to
alter
it
the
orderly
called
her
at
six
and
she
took
her
clients
to
a
barracks
in
the
suburbs
of
verdun
where
russian
prisoners
liberated
from
germany
crowded
and
jostled
to
see
her
from
behind
the
bars
of
the
barrack
square
like
wild
animals
in
a
cage
armed
sentries
paced
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
gateway
to
the
yard
as
it
came
on
to
snow
a
french
soldier
came
out
of
a
guardroom
and
invited
her
in
by
the
fire
inside
the
rest
of
the
guard
huddled
about
the
stove
and
behind
them
a
russian
prisoner
with
a
moon
face
swept
up
the
crumbs
from
their
last
meal
why
do
americans
guard
the
gate
she
asked
since
you
are
a
french
guard
because
we
do
shoot
with
enough
goodwill
grinned
a
little
man
but
who
do
you
want
to
shoot
those
fellows
said
the
little
man
slapping
the
russian
on
the
thigh
we
used
to
guard
the
gates
a
week
ago
but
the
russians
were
always
escaping
and
not
enough
were
shot
as
they
got
over
the
wall
so
they
said
americans
are
the
types
for
that
and
they
put
them
on
to
guard
the
gates
look
outside
you
are
having
a
success
mademoiselle
hundreds
of
russians
stood
about
together
outside
in
strange
poor
clothes
just
as
they
had
come
from
germany
peering
at
fanny
in
silence
through
the
open
doorway
but
i
thought
these
were
prisoners
from
germany
do
ask
me
said
the
little
man
disgustedly
i
wish
to
heaven
they
were
all
back
in
germany
look
at
me
i
fought
in
the
somme
the
aisne
and
verdun
and
now
at
the
end
of
the
war
i
left
here
to
look
after
these
pigs
a
sergeant
entered
a
man
to
take
the
prisoner
in
the
fourth
cell
up
to
the
doctor
he
said
sharply
it
not
my
turn
said
the
little
man
aggrieved
that
the
eye
of
the
sergeant
should
so
rest
on
him
it
yours
he
said
to
the
man
on
the
bench
beside
him
it
yours
replied
this
man
to
the
next
yes
it
chaumet
yes
it
chaumet
they
all
said
and
a
man
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
got
up
slowly
grumbling
and
turned
towards
the
door
here
dress
yourself
what
to
take
a
to
the
doctor
he
pulled
his
belt
and
gun
off
the
rack
with
an
and
disappeared
buckling
it
on
you
have
russians
in
cells
too
those
who
wo
work
yes
on
bread
and
water
that
one
has
been
on
bread
and
water
for
five
days
in
my
opinion
he
die
but
why
wo
they
work
work
he
wo
even
clean
his
own
cell
out
they
say
it
because
they
are
bolshevists
but
i
do
know
about
that
i
talk
a
little
russian
and
i
think
they
are
convinced
that
if
they
make
themselves
at
all
useful
to
us
we
shall
never
send
them
home
some
of
them
think
they
are
in
germany
still
they
an
ignorant
lot
an
american
came
in
rather
hesitatingly
but
without
nodding
to
the
french
we
got
in
our
camp
he
said
addressing
fanny
directly
i
do
like
to
bring
them
in
here
but
if
you
just
step
across
it
is
a
stone
throw
she
did
not
like
to
desert
the
french
but
she
was
sick
with
hunger
and
rose
she
knew
she
would
have
nothing
from
the
meal
for
they
probably
had
the
same
ration
as
she
one
piece
of
meat
two
potatoes
and
one
sardine
a
man
after
all
food
was
more
important
than
sentiment
and
she
followed
him
out
of
the
hut
you
wo
get
anything
from
those
skinflints
said
the
american
so
we
thought
you
better
come
and
have
some
chips
because
they
have
nothing
to
give
she
answered
half
inclined
to
turn
back
the
american
barracks
were
opposite
and
in
the
yard
under
a
shelter
of
planks
the
men
were
eating
round
a
complicated
travelling
kitchen
on
wheels
they
have
all
the
latest
richest
things
thought
fanny
jealous
for
the
french
antagonistic
yet
hungry
but
when
she
was
among
the
americans
they
were
simple
and
kind
to
her
offering
her
a
great
tray
of
fried
bacon
chips
concerned
that
she
should
have
to
eat
them
with
her
hand
washing
out
their
tin
mugs
and
filling
them
with
coffee
for
her
making
her
sit
on
a
barrel
while
she
ate
it
only
that
they
are
so
different
she
thought
so
different
from
the
french
that
they
can
never
meet
without
hurting
and
jarring
each
other
russians
slouched
about
in
the
snow
washing
the
pans
when
they
had
finished
eating
the
americans
called
to
the
russians
to
eat
what
remained
of
the
bacon
chips
watching
them
eat
with
the
hunger
of
animals
they
said
they
starve
them
in
the
french
barracks
we
give
them
food
here
or
they
sure
die
they
give
them
what
they
can
in
the
french
barracks
the
soldiers
get
a
ration
like
this
you
know
even
for
themselves
their
fault
for
not
kicking
up
a
shindy
said
the
americans
we
would
stand
it
you
have
no
idea
of
poverty
food
was
even
lying
in
the
snow
a
soldier
cook
thrust
his
head
out
of
a
hut
crying
any
one
want
any
more
chips
she
knew
that
it
was
probably
true
what
the
frenchman
had
said
that
the
americans
shot
the
russians
as
lightly
as
if
they
were
sparrows
yet
here
they
wept
over
the
french
ration
that
kept
the
russians
hungry
though
alive
and
well
what
a
curious
mixture
of
sentiment
and
brutality
they
were
she
pulled
out
her
cigarette
case
and
offered
a
cigarette
to
a
man
standing
near
her
he
took
it
and
answered
in
a
thick
lisping
jewish
accent
soft
and
uniformed
i
do
smoke
but
i
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
give
to
me
by
the
only
lady
i
seen
in
three
months
that
really
true
you
have
seen
a
woman
for
three
months
no
not
a
one
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
to
hear
us
say
that
just
as
though
you
were
a
zebra
there
some
one
over
by
your
car
said
the
sentry
who
had
no
idea
of
silence
at
his
post
she
got
up
quickly
and
flew
back
to
the
other
barracks
jumping
the
deep
pools
of
water
and
mud
and
the
little
heaps
of
soiled
snow
started
up
the
car
and
drove
back
to
the
for
lunch
at
they
started
out
again
to
chase
over
the
grey
downs
in
search
of
russian
camps
folded
away
in
small
depressions
and
hollows
invisible
from
the
main
roads
and
thus
day
after
day
for
five
days
she
drove
him
from
morning
to
evening
from
camp
to
camp
around
verdun
until
they
had
seen
many
thousands
of
russians
sometimes
the
french
lieutenant
came
with
them
and
once
or
twice
the
russian
gravely
invited
him
to
sit
in
front
with
the
driver
then
they
would
talk
together
a
little
in
english
and
once
he
said
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
something
that
will
surprise
you
and
interest
me
she
looked
round
your
employer
he
said
smiling
gently
over
the
expression
is
jealous
of
you
she
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
he
dislikes
it
intensely
when
you
talk
to
the
commandant
of
the
but
he
does
not
think
you
exclusive
enough
considering
you
as
he
does
as
but
why
yes
of
course
but
you
ought
to
realise
that
you
are
the
only
woman
for
miles
around
and
you
belong
to
us
you
too
well
yes
i
have
something
the
same
feeling
but
his
is
stronger
because
his
nature
is
oriental
he
thinks
woman
is
a
great
curiosity
therefore
a
great
treasure
and
this
treasure
belongs
to
me
i
brought
her
here
i
am
responsible
for
her
she
obeys
my
orders
but
does
he
tell
you
all
this
or
do
you
guess
it
we
talk
of
this
and
that
that
night
in
the
the
russian
leant
across
the
table
to
fanny
what
is
man
mystery
to
a
woman
if
she
lives
surrounded
by
him
oh
but
that
not
necessary
mystery
it
necessary
to
love
colonel
dellahousse
explained
the
lieutenant
smiling
very
much
does
not
believe
that
you
can
love
what
you
know
the
russian
nodded
love
is
based
on
a
fabulous
belief
an
illusory
image
which
fills
the
eyes
of
people
who
are
unused
to
each
other
this
poor
lady
will
soon
be
used
to
everything
fanny
who
felt
momentarily
alarmed
suddenly
remembered
julien
when
do
we
go
back
she
asked
absently
the
sympathetic
eyes
of
the
lieutenant
seemed
to
understand
even
that
and
he
smiled
again
they
left
next
day
after
the
midday
meal
before
lunch
she
met
a
soldier
who
stopped
her
in
one
of
the
branching
corridors
you
are
going
he
said
i
have
a
little
thing
to
ask
she
waited
mademoiselle
it
would
not
incommode
you
it
is
such
a
little
thing
think
we
have
not
seen
a
woman
here
so
long
still
she
waited
and
he
muttered
already
abashed
one
kiss
would
not
hurt
you
mademoiselle
let
me
pass
she
stammered
to
this
member
of
the
great
monastery
he
wavered
and
stood
aside
and
she
went
on
up
the
corridor
vaguely
ashamed
of
her
refusal
we
go
now
said
the
russian
rising
from
the
luncheon
table
are
you
satisfied
with
your
experience
mademoiselle
my
experience
verdun
this
life
is
strange
to
you
i
have
seen
you
reflective
now
if
you
will
go
out
to
the
car
you
shall
go
back
to
your
civilised
town
where
the
governor
so
dislikes
me
and
you
shall
see
your
women
friends
again
but
we
are
not
coming
all
the
way
with
you
no
no
we
stay
at
briey
you
return
from
briey
alone
they
set
out
once
more
upon
the
roads
which
ran
between
the
dead
violence
of
the
plains
between
trenches
that
wandered
down
from
the
side
of
a
sandy
hillock
by
villages
which
appeared
like
an
illusion
upon
the
hillside
fading
as
they
passed
and
reforming
into
the
semblance
of
houses
in
the
distance
behind
them
the
clouds
above
their
heads
were
built
up
to
a
great
height
rocky
and
cavernous
crows
swung
on
outspread
wings
dived
and
alighted
heavily
on
the
earth
like
fowls
they
came
behind
the
old
german
lines
and
the
road
changing
led
them
through
short
patches
of
covering
woods
filled
with
instruments
depôt
after
depôt
was
piled
between
the
trees
and
the
notices
hanging
from
the
branches
chattered
antique
directions
at
them
the
drinking
trough
the
drinking
trough
cried
one
but
they
had
no
horse
to
water
take
this
path
urged
another
for
the
but
they
flew
by
too
fast
to
read
the
end
of
the
message
while
the
path
pursued
them
a
little
way
among
the
pines
then
turned
abruptly
away
do
not
smoke
here
nicht
rauchen
streng
cried
the
notices
in
furious
impotent
voices
the
wood
chattered
and
spat
with
cries
with
commands
for
which
the
men
who
made
them
cared
no
longer
the
hungry
noses
of
old
guns
snuffed
at
the
car
as
it
rolled
by
guns
dragging
still
upon
their
flanks
the
torn
cloak
of
camouflage
small
squat
guns
which
stared
idly
into
the
air
or
with
wider
mouths
still
like
petrified
dogs
for
ever
baying
at
the
moon
long
slim
guns
which
lay
along
the
grass
and
pushing
undergrowth
and
one
gun
which
had
dipped
forward
and
fallen
upon
its
knees
howled
silenced
imprecations
at
the
devil
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
when
they
had
passed
the
shattered
staging
of
the
past
they
came
out
upon
the
country
which
had
been
occupied
by
germans
but
not
by
warfare
here
the
fields
uncultivated
had
grown
wild
but
round
the
sparse
villages
little
patches
of
ground
had
been
dug
and
sown
not
a
cow
grazed
anywhere
not
a
sheep
or
a
goat
no
hens
raced
wildly
across
village
streets
far
ahead
on
the
white
ribbon
of
road
a
black
figure
toiled
in
the
gutter
and
fanny
debated
with
herself
might
i
offer
a
lift
looking
ahead
she
saw
no
village
or
cottage
within
sight
and
with
a
murmured
apology
to
the
russian
she
pulled
up
beside
the
old
woman
whom
she
had
overtaken
where
are
you
going
to
briey
we
too
get
in
madame
the
russian
made
no
comment
the
old
crone
knuckled
climbed
in
holding
uncertainly
to
the
windscreen
and
pulling
after
her
her
basket
and
umbrella
cover
yourself
madame
ordered
fanny
as
to
a
child
and
handed
her
a
rug
i
have
never
been
in
an
auto
before
whispered
the
old
creature
against
a
wind
which
made
her
breathless
i
have
seen
them
pass
you
are
not
afraid
oh
no
cover
yourself
well
well
gallant
old
women
toiling
like
ants
upon
the
long
stretches
of
road
who
suddenly
finding
themselves
projected
through
the
air
at
a
pace
they
had
never
experienced
in
their
lives
before
would
say
not
a
word
though
the
colour
be
whipped
to
their
cheeks
and
their
eyes
rained
tears
until
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
driver
stop
here
mademoiselle
they
would
whisper
expecting
the
car
to
rear
and
stop
dead
at
their
own
doorstep
and
finding
themselves
still
carried
on
and
half
believing
themselves
kidnapped
ah
mademoiselle
stop
stop
they
slipped
down
into
the
pit
of
briey
where
the
houses
cling
to
the
sides
of
a
circular
hollow
and
drew
up
by
a
white
house
which
the
frenchman
indicated
the
old
woman
searched
trembling
and
out
of
breath
for
her
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
streaming
eyes
then
as
she
climbed
out
backwards
with
feet
feeling
for
the
ground
what
do
i
owe
you
mademoiselle
ah
nothing
nothing
i
am
not
at
all
poor
and
leaving
a
piece
on
the
seat
she
hurried
away
colonel
dellahousse
came
to
the
side
of
the
car
and
thanked
fanny
ceremoniously
and
if
i
do
not
see
you
again
mademoiselle
he
said
remember
what
i
say
and
go
back
to
your
home
before
the
pleasure
of
life
is
spoilt
for
you
said
the
french
lieutenant
soon
after
she
had
left
briey
snow
began
to
fall
a
river
circled
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
and
she
followed
its
windings
on
a
road
which
ran
just
above
it
night
wiped
out
the
colours
on
the
hills
around
her
until
the
moon
rose
and
they
glowed
again
half
trees
half
light
she
climbed
slowly
up
to
a
plateau
not
a
dozen
miles
from
metz
an
hour
later
the
car
put
away
in
the
garage
fanny
was
tapping
at
the
window
of
the
bath
house
in
the
town
the
beautiful
fat
woman
who
prepared
the
baths
answered
her
tap
fräulein
said
fanny
would
it
matter
if
i
had
a
bath
is
it
too
late
i
turn
it
on
myself
and
dry
it
afterwards
what
did
the
woman
mind
if
fanny
had
a
bath
fat
and
beautiful
she
had
nothing
left
to
wish
for
and
contentedly
she
gave
her
the
corner
room
overlooking
the
canal
and
the
theatre
square
wishing
her
a
full
of
german
blessings
the
water
ran
boiling
out
of
the
tap
and
the
smoke
curled
up
over
the
and
the
when
the
bath
was
full
to
the
brim
she
got
in
lay
back
and
pulled
open
the
window
with
her
toe
the
beautiful
french
theatre
piebald
with
snow
and
shadow
shone
over
the
the
cathedral
clock
struck
out
ten
chimes
whirling
and
singing
over
her
head
the
voices
of
the
little
boys
died
down
the
last
had
thrown
his
last
snowball
and
gone
to
bed
the
steam
rose
up
like
a
veil
before
the
window
and
once
again
between
the
grey
walls
of
her
bath
so
like
her
cradle
and
her
coffin
she
meditated
upon
the
riches
and
treasure
of
the
passing
days
and
yet
echoed
the
thoughts
in
that
still
water
travelling
still
to
travel
is
not
to
move
across
the
earth
peering
back
into
the
past
frowning
in
the
effort
to
string
forgotten
words
together
fanny
whispered
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
the
strange
things
of
travel
the
east
and
the
west
the
hill
beyond
the
hill
but
the
poem
was
shattered
as
the
voice
of
the
bath
woman
called
to
her
through
the
door
you
are
well
fräulein
fanny
turned
in
her
bath
astonished
why
yes
thank
you
did
you
think
i
was
ill
i
did
know
i
dare
go
to
bed
till
i
see
you
out
for
last
week
we
had
a
woman
who
killed
herself
in
here
drowned
in
the
water
i
have
just
remembered
her
well
i
wo
drown
myself
i
can
never
be
sure
now
she
gave
me
such
shock
well
i
getting
out

the
lover
in
the
lamp
how
do
you
know
you
will
meet
him
said
the
cold
morning
light
and
when
she
walked
in
it
the
city
looked
big
enough
to
hide
his
face
in
the
first
street
a
girl
said
the
name
of
julien
without
knowing
what
it
was
she
said
but
only
a
child
shrieked
in
answer
from
a
magic
square
of
chalk
upon
the
pavement
you
been
away
for
days
and
days
said
her
companions
at
the
garage
to
show
that
they
had
noticed
it
where
have
you
been
the
garage
faded
verdun
she
said
and
verdun
lacy
and
perilous
hung
in
her
mind
whom
did
you
take
she
struggled
with
the
confusing
image
of
the
russian
before
she
could
reply
the
other
said
there
to
be
an
inspection
of
the
cars
this
morning
you
have
to
get
something
done
to
your
car
outside
in
the
yard
the
sun
was
gay
upon
the
thinly
but
in
the
shadow
of
the
garage
the
glass
and
brass
of
seventy
or
eighty
cars
glowed
in
a
veiled
bloom
of
polish
only
the
which
had
been
to
verdun
stood
unready
for
the
inspection
coated
from
wheel
to
hood
with
white
meuse
mud
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
her
until
she
had
been
under
the
hose
out
in
the
street
where
the
hose
was
fastened
to
the
hydrant
the
little
pests
of
metz
clustered
eagerly
standing
on
the
hose
pipe
where
the
bursts
were
tied
with
string
and
by
dexterous
pressure
diverting
the
leaks
into
gay
fountains
that
flew
up
and
pierced
the
windows
opposite
as
the
mud
rolled
off
under
the
blast
of
the
hose
and
left
the
car
streaky
and
dripping
the
little
boys
dipping
their
feet
into
the
gutters
and
paddled
soaked
and
bareheaded
fanny
drove
the
clean
car
slowly
back
into
the
garage
and
set
her
in
her
place
in
the
long
line
stewart
beside
her
whispered
they
come
they
come
starting
at
the
other
end
four
officers
fanny
pulled
her
tin
of
english
brasso
from
a
and
began
to
rub
a
lamp
at
the
far
far
end
of
the
long
shed
four
men
were
standing
with
their
backs
to
her
round
a
car
the
globed
lamp
was
tricky
and
the
would
slip
and
let
her
bark
her
knuckle
on
the
bracket
but
the
glow
born
in
the
brass
grew
clearer
and
clearer
till
suddenly
stooping
to
it
she
looked
into
a
mirror
and
saw
all
the
garage
behind
her
and
the
long
rows
of
cars
bent
in
a
yellow
curve
and
little
men
and
oily
women
walking
incredibly
upon
the
rounded
ball
of
the
world
they
hung
with
their
feet
on
curving
walls
running
and
walking
without
difficulty
blinking
moving
talking
in
a
yellow
lake
of
brass
julien
dennis
and
two
others
stopping
at
car
after
car
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
julien
holding
the
inspection
nodded
gravely
to
their
comments
searching
car
after
car
with
his
eyes
as
he
walked
up
the
garage
until
they
rested
on
the
head
and
the
hair
of
the
girl
he
knew
then
he
paused
three
cars
from
her
and
watched
the
head
as
it
hung
motionless
level
with
the
lamp
she
had
just
turned
into
a
mirror
and
within
the
field
of
her
vision
he
had
just
appeared
he
paused
fantastic
upon
the
ball
of
the
world
balanced
amazingly
with
his
feet
on
the
slope
of
a
golden
corridor
and
hypnotised
she
watched
his
face
bent
into
the
horn
of
a
young
moon
julien
and
yet
unearthly
and
impossible
there
were
his
two
hands
lit
in
a
brassy
fire
hanging
down
his
sides
and
the
cane
which
he
held
in
his
left
went
out
beyond
the
scope
of
the
corridor
the
three
others
hung
around
him
like
bent
corn
she
watched
these
yellow
shades
as
tall
as
ladders
talk
and
act
in
the
little
theatre
of
the
lamp
he
was
coming
up
to
her
he
became
enormous
his
head
flew
out
of
the
top
of
the
world
his
feet
ran
down
into
the
centre
of
the
earth
he
was
effacing
the
garage
he
had
eaten
up
the
corridor
and
all
the
cars
he
must
be
touching
her
he
must
have
swallowed
her
too
his
voice
in
her
ear
said
you
gone
for
ever
i
i
had
gone
she
drew
her
gaze
out
of
the
mirror
the
world
outside
let
him
down
again
on
to
his
feet
and
he
stood
beside
her
and
said
gently
in
her
ear
will
you
meet
me
again
in
the
cathedral
at
four
she
nodded
and
he
turned
away
and
she
saw
that
he
was
so
unknown
to
her
that
she
could
hardly
tell
his
uniformed
back
from
the
backs
of
those
about
him
to
meet
this
stranger
then
at
four
in
the
cathedral
she
prepared
herself
with
more
care
than
she
would
have
given
to
meet
her
oldest
friend
the
gilded
day
went
by
while
she
did
little
things
with
the
holy
air
of
a
nun
at
her
lamp
polishing
her
shoes
her
belt
her
cap
badge
sitting
on
her
bed
beneath
the
stag
horn
an
enraptured
sailor
upon
the
deck
of
the
world
around
the
old
basin
on
the
washstand
faded
blue
animals
chased
each
other
and
snapped
at
ferns
and
roses
she
lifted
the
jug
and
drowned
the
beasts
in
water
and
even
to
wash
her
hands
was
a
rite
which
sent
a
shower
of
thoughts
flying
through
her
mind
how
many
before
her
had
called
this
room
a
sanctuary
a
temple
and
prepared
as
carefully
as
she
for
some
charmed
meeting
in
the
crannies
of
the
town
this
room
this
corridor
the
passengers
travellers
soldiers
who
had
used
this
bed
for
a
night
and
passed
on
thought
of
it
only
as
a
segment
in
the
endless
chain
of
rooms
that
sheltered
them
bed
washstand
chair
table
rustled
with
history
soldiers
resting
from
the
battle
out
there
by
kissing
the
girl
who
lived
in
the
back
room
waking
in
the
morning
as
darkly
as
she
leaving
the
room
to
another
soldiers
coming
up
from
germany
trembling
in
the
room
as
they
heard
the
thunder
out
at
an
officer
that
ugly
wooden
boy
who
stared
at
her
from
the
wall
above
the
mantelpiece
what
a
mark
he
had
left
on
the
household
that
they
should
frame
him
in
velvet
and
keep
him
staring
at
his
own
bed
for
ever
she
all
but
saw
spirits
and
shivered
at
the
procession
of
life
outside
in
the
street
she
heard
a
cry
and
her
name
called
under
the
window
how
like
the
cry
that
afternoon
a
week
ago
which
had
sent
her
to
verdun
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
she
peered
cautiously
out
at
sight
of
her
a
voice
cried
up
from
the
street
there
is
a
fancy
dress
dance
next
tuesday
night
i
warning
every
one
it
so
hard
to
get
stuffs
the
voice
passed
on
to
the
house
where
stewart
lived
how
nice
of
her
this
was
a
good
day
what
shall
i
wear
at
the
dance
there
about
the
face
of
the
clock
windless
and
steady
hung
the
hours
not
yet
time
to
start
not
yet
through
the
lace
of
the
curtain
and
the
now
closed
window
the
shadows
hurried
by
upon
the
pavement
heads
bobbed
below
upon
the
street
oh
dark
and
pale
and
plain
walking
soberly
in
hat
and
coat
what
sign
in
these
faces
of
the
silver
webbery
within
the
brain
of
the
flashing
fancies
and
merry
plans
like
birds
gone
mad
in
a
cage
the
tram
as
antique
as
a
sedan
chair
clanked
across
the
bridge
over
the
river
and
changing
its
note
as
it
reached
firmer
land
roared
and
bumbled
like
a
huge
bee
into
the
little
street
stopping
below
her
window
it
was
assailed
by
little
creatures
who
threw
themselves
as
greedily
within
as
if
they
were
setting
out
upon
a
wild
adventure
all
going
to
meet
somebody
said
fanny
whose
mind
drowned
in
her
happiness
took
the
narrowest
view
of
life
but
for
all
their
push
and
hurry
the
little
creatures
in
the
glass
cage
were
forced
to
unfold
their
newspapers
and
stare
at
each
other
for
occupation
while
the
driver
and
climbing
down
from
the
opposite
ends
of
the
car
conferred
together
in
the
street
it
waiting
for
the
other
tram
and
even
as
she
said
it
she
found
the
clock
behind
her
back
had
leapt
mysteriously
and
slyly
forward
i
take
the
other
and
going
downstairs
she
stood
in
the
shelter
of
her
doorway
out
of
the
cold
wind
that
blew
along
the
street
the
delay
of
the
other
car
brought
her
well
up
to
her
hour
i
even
be
a
little
late
she
thought
proud
of
herself
do
talk
to
the
said
the
notices
in
the
tramcar
crossly
to
her
in
german
as
she
slipped
and
slid
upon
its
straining
seats
do
spit
do
smoke
do
but
she
had
her
revenge
for
across
all
the
notices
side
of
the
war
had
written
coldly
you
are
begged
in
the
measure
possible
to
you
to
talk
only
french
when
they
got
into
the
narrow
town
the
tramcar
mysteriously
swelling
seemed
to
chip
the
shop
windows
and
bump
the
front
doors
and
people
upon
the
pavement
scrambled
between
the
glass
of
the
tram
and
the
glass
of
the
big
drapery
shop
they
met
as
it
were
in
the
very
centre
of
a
conversation
i
never
know
where
you
are
he
complained
as
though
this
trouble
was
so
in
his
thoughts
that
he
must
speak
of
it
at
once
or
when
i
shall
see
you
again
she
smiled
radiantly
busier
with
greeting
less
absorbed
than
he
you
may
go
away
and
never
come
back
you
go
so
far
she
went
away
often
and
far
but
that
was
his
trouble
not
hers
he
at
least
remained
stationary
in
metz
she
was
full
of
another
thought
the
vagueness
the
precariousness
of
the
chance
that
even
in
metz
had
brought
them
together
how
lucky
how
lucky
what
how
lucky
how
lucky
he
begged
implored
frowned
tried
to
peer
he
would
not
let
her
rest
why
should
you
hide
what
you
think
i
like
it
oh
no
he
did
not
like
it
no
one
likes
to
get
hint
of
that
fountain
of
talk
which
sweet
or
bitter
plays
just
out
of
reach
of
the
ear
just
behind
the
mask
of
the
face
how
lucky
that
you
held
the
inspection
had
all
but
stolen
from
her
lips
but
this
implied
too
clearly
that
it
was
lucky
for
somebody
for
her
for
him
and
how
could
she
say
that
her
thoughts
were
so
far
in
advance
of
her
confessions
a
dozen
sentences
rose
to
her
lips
all
too
clear
too
intimate
so
she
became
silent
before
the
things
that
she
could
not
say
of
what
are
you
thinking
extortionate
question
am
i
to
put
all
my
fortune
in
your
hand
like
that
am
i
to
say
you
of
you
for
every
word
she
said
aloud
she
said
a
hundred
to
herself
and
after
three
words
between
them
she
had
the
impression
of
a
whole
conversation
one
must
arrange
some
plan
he
said
pursuing
his
perplexity
so
that
i
know
when
you
go
and
when
you
come
back
i
ca
always
be
holding
inspections
to
find
out
it
was
for
that
you
held
the
inspection
why
of
course
of
course
but
entirely
to
find
out
divided
between
the
desire
to
make
him
say
it
again
and
the
fear
of
driving
his
motives
into
daylight
i
did
know
what
to
do
i
could
telephone
and
ask
whether
your
car
had
returned
wonderful
and
excellent
she
had
had
the
notion
while
she
was
at
verdun
that
something
might
be
rolling
up
to
her
account
in
the
bank
at
metz
and
now
he
was
giving
her
proof
after
proof
of
the
accumulation
but
from
the
valley
of
vanity
she
suddenly
flew
up
to
wonder
he
does
that
for
me
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
of
her
mind
he
does
it
for
me
but
of
what
use
to
look
at
the
daylight
image
of
herself
the
khaki
figure
the
driver
for
he
must
be
looking
at
glory
as
i
do
the
russian
said
love
is
an
illusory
image
is
it
strange
how
these
human
creatures
can
cast
it
like
a
net
out
of
their
personality
vanity
creeping
above
love
beat
it
down
like
a
stick
beats
down
a
fire
it
was
too
easy
he
gave
her
nothing
left
to
wish
for
the
spell
over
him
she
felt
was
complete
and
now
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
develop
her
own
and
this
she
had
instantly
less
inclination
to
do
but
guided
by
his
bright
wits
he
too
withdrew
let
the
tacit
assumption
of
intimacy
drop
between
them
and
their
walk
by
the
moselle
was
filled
by
her
talk
of
the
russian
prisoners
and
verdun
she
glanced
at
him
from
time
to
time
and
would
have
grown
more
silent
but
by
his
light
questions
he
kept
her
talking
briskly
on
offering
her
no
new
proof
until
she
grew
unsure
and
wondered
whether
she
had
been
mistaken
and
the
hour
striking
for
her
supper
in
the
town
she
went
to
it
filled
anew
with
his
charm
and
her
anxiety
other
meetings
came
when
thrilling
with
the
of
belief
and
doubt
they
watched
each
other
with
absorbed
attention
and
in
their
fragile
and
unconfessed
relationship
sometimes
one
was
the
victor
and
sometimes
the
vanquished
yet
what
was
plain
to
the
man
who
swept
the
mud
from
the
streets
was
not
plain
to
them
does
he
love
me
already
will
she
love
me
soon
when
they
saw
other
couples
by
the
banks
of
the
moselle
reason
in
a
convinced
and
careless
voice
said
that
is
love
but
on
coming
towards
each
other
they
were
not
sure
at
all
and
each
said
of
the
other
he
may
not
meet
me
she
will
say
she
is
busy
and
it
will
not
be
true
when
fanny
said
he
may
not
meet
me
she
was
mad
how
could
he
fail
to
meet
her
when
the
rolling
hours
hung
fire
and
buzzed
about
his
head
like
loaded
bees
unable
to
proceed
when
in
a
lethargy
of
vision
he
signed
his
name
at
the
bottom
of
the
typewritten
sheet
saying
confusedly
what
does
she
think
does
she
think
of
me
when
at
last
they
met
under
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
they
would
exclaim
in
their
hearts
what
next
and
hurry
off
by
the
moselle
looking
into
the
future
looking
into
the
future
and
yet
warding
it
off
aware
of
the
open
speech
that
must
soon
lie
between
them
and
yet
charmed
by
the
beautiful
the
merciful
the
delay
and
going
home
each
would
study
the
hours
they
had
spent
together
as
a
traveller
returned
from
wonderful
lands
pores
over
the
cold
map
which
for
him
sparkles
with
mountains
and
rivers
that
very
saturday
night
after
the
early
supper
in
their
room
in
the
town
she
had
gone
out
to
the
big
draper
shop
which
did
not
close
till
seven
almost
running
into
reherrey
on
the
pavement
i
going
to
weile
he
said
i
going
there
myself
to
get
your
dress
yes
they
went
into
the
large
empty
shop
together
to
be
surrounded
at
once
by
a
group
of
idle
girls
stuffs
said
fanny
thinking
vaguely
black
bombazine
said
reherrey
who
had
finished
his
thinking
fanny
followed
reherrey
to
a
counter
backed
by
rows
of
empty
shelves
they
had
no
black
bombazine
black
tulle
said
reherrey
with
his
air
of
cool
indifference
black
gauze
black
cotton
it
had
to
be
black
sateen
in
the
end
now
you
said
reherrey
when
he
had
bought
six
yards
at
eight
francs
a
yard
white
something
for
me
there
was
white
nothing
under
sixteen
francs
a
yard
but
cheap
cheap
cheap
stuff
she
expostulated
stuff
you
would
make
lampshades
of
or
dusters
it
only
for
a
fancy
dress
the
idle
little
girls
assumed
a
special
air
fanny
looked
round
the
shop
in
desperation
it
was
like
all
the
shops
in
metz
the
window
dressed
the
saleswomen
ready
the
shelves
scrubbed
out
and
polished
the
lady
waiting
at
the
pay
desk
but
the
goods
had
come
here
and
there
a
shelf
held
a
roll
or
two
of
some
material
and
eventually
fanny
bought
seven
yards
of
white
soft
stuff
at
seven
francs
a
yard
white
said
reherrey
with
a
critical
look
how
fanny
had
an
idea
of
her
own
she
said
heavily
to
elsa
mother
still
later
in
the
evening
eine
schneiderin
a
dressmaker
who
speaks
french
elsa
took
her
out
into
the
dark
street
again
and
in
at
a
neighbouring
archway
till
at
the
back
of
deep
courtyards
they
found
a
tiny
flat
of
a
little
old
lady
like
this
explained
fanny
drawing
with
her
pencil
why
my
mother
had
a
dress
like
that
said
the
little
lady
pleased
before
the
last
war
she
nodded
many
times
i
know
how
to
make
a
crinoline
but
when
do
you
want
it
for
tuesday
night
ah
dear
mademoiselle
how
can
i
is
saturday
i
have
only
and
monday
unless
are
you
a
catholic
no
then
you
can
sew
on
sunday
you
can
do
the
frills
all
sunday
fanny
sewed
frills
under
the
stag
horn
and
when
she
went
to
meet
julien
in
the
late
afternoon
she
had
the
frills
still
in
a
parcel
what
is
that
he
asked
as
she
unfolded
the
parcel
in
the
empty
cathedral
and
began
to
thread
her
needle
my
dress
for
the
dance
what
is
it
going
to
be
frills
hundreds
of
frills
she
shook
her
lap
a
little
and
yards
and
yards
of
white
frills
leapt
on
to
the
floor
in
a
river
those
flowers
you
bought
look
you
have
never
put
them
in
water
he
shook
his
head
and
leaning
from
his
chair
stretched
out
his
arm
for
the
parcel
of
white
paper
they
are
dying
smell
them
they
yield
more
scent
when
they
die
she
sat
holding
the
flowers
near
her
face
and
not
thinking
of
him
very
distinctly
but
not
thinking
of
anything
else
but
they
wo
last
they
will
last
this
visit
i
get
new
ones
oh
how
extravagant
you
are
with
happiness
they
looked
startled
and
became
silent
for
every
now
and
then
among
their
talk
some
sentence
which
they
had
thought
discreet
rang
out
with
a
clarity
which
disturbed
them
between
them
there
had
been
no
avowal
and
neither
could
count
on
the
other
secret
she
was
not
sure
he
loved
her
and
though
he
argued
why
should
she
come
if
she
does
not
care
he
watched
her
sit
by
him
with
as
little
confidence
with
as
much
despair
as
if
she
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
ocean
is
it
raining
again
how
dark
it
gets
i
must
soon
go
she
made
gaps
in
and
scattered
that
alarming
silence
in
which
the
image
of
each
filled
and
fitted
into
the
thoughts
of
the
other
like
an
orange
into
its
close
rind
yet
so
dark
and
perfect
is
the
mask
of
the
face
so
dull
the
inner
ear
that
each
looked
uncertainly
about
half
deaf
to
the
song
which
issued
so
plainly
from
the
other
distracted
by
the
great
gaps
in
the
music
wo
you
stay
with
me
till
you
have
sewn
to
the
end
of
that
frill
she
sat
down
again
without
a
word
and
greedy
after
his
victory
he
added
but
i
ought
to
keep
you
i
want
to
stay
too
the
frill
flowed
on
with
the
beat
of
the
cathedral
clock
and
came
to
an
end
now
i
must
go
it
supper
supper
in
the
garage
he
walked
with
her
almost
in
silence
down
the
cathedral
steps
and
to
the
door
of
the
house
in
the
dark
street
by
the
river
you
do
say
so
curiously
he
remarked
so
suddenly
perhaps
it
english
perhaps
it
is
she
agreed
disappearing
into
the
house
what
have
you
got
there
said
her
companions
in
the
lighted
room
upstairs
my
dress
for
the
dance
but
she
did
not
open
the
parcel
to
show
them
the
charmed
frills
how
is
it
they
do
know
that
i
left
him
in
the
street
below
she
looked
at
the
seven
travellers
who
met
each
night
round
the
table
for
dinner
overcome
with
the
mystery
of
those
uncommunicating
shrouded
heads
what
have
they
all
been
doing
has
every
one
had
runs
yes
every
one
has
been
out
what
have
you
been
doing
i
have
left
metz
she
replied
giddy
with
the
isolation
and
the
silence
of
the
human
mind
chapter
vii
the
three
clients
what
cried
fanny
on
monday
morning
staring
at
the
and
at
the
pink
paper
he
offered
her
at
once
at
once
mademoiselle
you
ought
to
have
been
told
last
night
you
must
go
back
for
your
things
for
the
night
and
then
as
quickly
as
you
can
to
the
hôtel
de
i
do
know
how
many
days
you
be
but
here
is
an
order
for
fifty
litres
of
petrol
and
a
can
of
oil
and
pichot
is
getting
you
two
spare
tubes
she
stared
at
him
in
horror
a
moment
longer
then
took
the
pink
order
and
disappeared
through
the
dark
garage
door
her
mind
was
in
a
frenzy
of
protestation
she
saw
the
waiting
cars
which
might
have
gone
instead
the
drivers
polishing
a
patch
of
brass
for
want
of
something
to
do
and
accident
pure
accident
had
lighted
on
to
sweep
out
of
metz
away
from
that
luminous
personality
which
brooded
over
the
city
like
a
sunset
out
into
the
nondescript
world
the
cold
white
frills
and
yards
of
bleached
calico
lying
at
the
cried
out
to
her
to
stay
to
make
some
protest
to
say
something
anything
that
she
was
ill
and
stay
she
splashed
petrol
wastefully
into
the
tank
holding
the
small
blue
tin
with
firm
hands
high
in
the
air
above
the
leather
strainer
and
the
funnel
and
if
i
said
it
is
mad
if
i
said
am
in
love
ca
send
some
one
who
is
not
in
love
she
glanced
down
from
her
perch
on
the
footboard
at
the
olive
profile
bent
over
the
next
car
the
driver
was
sitting
on
his
step
with
his
open
hand
outstretched
to
hold
a
dozen
bright
washers
which
he
was
stirring
with
his
forefinger
the
hand
with
the
washers
sank
gently
to
rest
on
his
knee
and
he
sighed
as
he
ceased
stirring
and
looked
absently
down
the
garage
his
mystical
cloak
of
bone
and
skin
shrouding
his
thoughts
idle
men
all
down
the
garage
hung
about
the
cars
each
holding
within
him
some
private
affection
some
close
hope
something
which
sent
a
spurt
of
dubious
song
out
of
his
mouth
or
his
eyes
wandering
sightless
down
the
shed
the
tank
resenting
her
treatment
overflowed
violently
and
drenched
her
skirt
and
feet
are
you
ready
mademoiselle
coming
where
are
the
tubes
i
have
them
she
drove
through
the
yard
down
the
street
and
hurried
over
the
bridge
to
her
room
nightgown
toothbrush
comb
sponge
and
powder
hating
every
hour
of
the
days
and
nights
her
preparations
meant
at
the
hôtel
de
three
men
waited
for
her
with
frowns
loaded
with
plaid
rugs
mufflers
black
bags
and
gaping
baskets
of
food
from
which
protruded
bottles
of
wine
it
was
then
to
be
one
of
those
days
when
they
lunched
by
the
wayside
in
the
bitter
cold
she
drew
up
beside
them
a
huge
man
with
an
unclean
bearskin
coat
and
flaccid
red
cheeks
told
her
she
was
very
late
she
listened
apologising
but
intent
only
on
her
question
and
could
you
tell
me
i
so
dreadfully
sorry
but
they
only
told
me
very
late
at
the
garage
and
would
you
mind
telling
me
which
day
you
expect
to
get
back
he
turned
to
the
others
it
depends
said
a
dry
dark
man
with
a
look
of
rebuke
on
our
work
night
perhaps
perhaps
the
next
morning
where
shall
i
drive
you
go
out
by
thionville
we
are
going
up
the
moselle
to
trèves
anxious
to
dispose
of
such
a
mountain
of
a
man
it
was
suggested
that
the
bearskin
should
climb
in
beside
the
driver
instantly
fanny
was
smothered
up
as
he
sat
down
placing
so
many
packages
between
himself
and
the
outer
side
of
the
car
that
he
sank
heavily
against
her
arm
and
the
fur
of
his
coat
blew
into
her
mouth
in
discomfort
she
drove
them
from
the
town
brooding
over
her
wheel
unhappily
on
and
on
till
metz
had
sunk
over
the
edge
of
the
flat
horizon
the
weary
way
to
thionville
unfurled
before
them
furnaces
to
the
left
and
flat
grass
prairie
to
the
right
little
villages
and
clustering
houses
went
by
them
and
thionville
itself
with
its
tramlines
and
faint
air
of
manchester
drew
near
beyond
thionville
the
road
changed
colour
abruptly
and
stretched
red
and
gravelly
before
them
the
frost
deepened
the
wheels
bit
harder
on
the
road
surface
the
sparkled
with
a
brittle
light
and
scanty
winter
orchards
sprang
up
beside
the
road
which
narrowed
down
and
became
a
lane
of
beautiful
surface
not
for
long
however
for
the
surface
changed
again
and
long
hours
set
in
when
the
car
had
to
be
held
desperately
with
foot
and
hand
brake
to
save
the
springs
and
the
accelerator
could
only
be
touched
to
be
relinquished
fanny
hardly
sad
any
more
but
busy
and
hungry
secretly
lifted
the
corner
of
her
sleeve
to
peer
at
her
and
seeing
that
it
was
twelve
began
to
wonder
how
soon
they
would
decide
to
sit
down
by
the
roadside
for
their
lunch
she
fumbled
in
the
pocket
of
the
car
but
the
last
piece
of
chocolate
had
either
been
eaten
or
had
slipped
down
between
the
leather
and
the
wood
she
could
bring
up
nothing
better
than
an
old
postcard
a
hairpin
and
a
forgotten
scrap
of
at
last
they
stopped
for
lunch
choosing
a
spot
where
a
hedge
rose
wirily
against
the
midday
sky
and
spread
the
rugs
on
the
frozen
grass
the
sudden
cessation
of
movement
and
noise
brought
a
stillness
into
the
landscape
a
child
voice
startled
them
from
the
outskirts
of
a
village
beyond
and
the
crackle
of
a
wheelbarrow
that
was
being
driven
along
the
dry
road
the
third
man
who
had
blackberry
eyes
and
glasses
which
enlarged
them
made
great
preparations
over
the
setting
of
the
meal
they
had
forgotten
nothing
when
they
sat
down
the
bearskin
upon
the
step
of
the
motor
the
others
upon
the
ground
each
man
had
a
napkin
as
big
as
a
sheet
spread
across
the
surface
of
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
tied
into
the
band
of
the
overcoat
at
the
side
bottles
of
red
wine
and
a
bottle
of
white
to
finish
with
lay
on
a
cloth
spread
upon
the
grass
bread
cheese
sausage
and
a
slab
of
chocolate
knives
forks
and
a
china
cup
apiece
fanny
who
had
taken
her
own
uneatable
lunch
from
the
garage
was
made
to
eat
some
of
theirs
they
were
on
a
high
dry
open
plateau
of
land
and
the
winter
sun
not
strong
enough
to
break
the
frost
faintly
warmed
their
necks
and
hands
and
the
round
bodies
of
the
bottles
it
was
not
unpleasant
sitting
there
with
the
three
strangers
watching
the
sky
through
the
prongs
of
the
bare
hedge
spreading
on
to
fresh
bread
and
balancing
her
cup
half
full
of
red
wine
among
the
fibres
and
roots
of
the
grass
now
that
i
have
started
i
am
well
on
my
way
to
getting
back
she
thought
and
found
that
within
her
breast
the
black
despair
of
the
morning
had
melted
she
watched
her
companions
for
amusement
the
bearskin
cumbrous
and
looked
like
an
innkeeper
in
an
english
tavern
when
he
took
off
his
cloth
hood
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
staring
as
the
pink
of
his
face
against
the
blue
of
his
cap
but
when
the
cap
came
off
too
for
a
second
that
he
might
stir
his
forehead
with
his
finger
the
blaze
and
crackle
of
his
red
hair
beneath
was
even
more
ferocious
yet
he
seemed
intimidated
by
his
companions
and
kept
silence
eating
meekly
from
his
knife
and
spreading
his
napkin
with
care
to
the
edge
of
his
knees
the
little
man
with
warm
black
eyes
and
the
colder
thinner
man
talked
appreciatively
together
the
is
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
and
you
have
tried
the
cheese
no
no
i
never
touch
cheese
before
the
wine
it
a
sin
now
the
bottle
is
all
warmed
try
some
what
is
your
father
said
the
little
man
suddenly
to
fanny
he
is
in
the
army
you
have
no
brother
no
one
to
take
care
of
you
you
mean
because
i
come
out
here
but
in
england
they
do
mind
they
think
it
interesting
for
us
tiens
they
obviously
did
not
believe
her
and
turned
to
other
subjects
but
the
bearskin
began
to
move
uncomfortably
on
the
step
of
the
car
and
bending
forward
to
attract
their
attention
he
burst
out
but
do
you
know
mademoiselle
is
not
paid
the
others
reconsidered
her
how
do
you
live
then
mademoiselle
you
have
means
of
your
own
you
do
not
buy
your
clothes
yourself
your
government
gives
you
those
and
that
fine
leather
coat
i
bought
it
myself
said
fanny
and
caused
a
sensation
immediately
they
put
out
their
delicate
hands
and
fingers
that
loved
to
appraise
to
feel
the
leather
on
the
lapel
how
soft
we
have
no
leather
now
like
that
in
france
how
much
did
that
cost
no
let
me
guess
you
never
paid
a
sou
less
than
well
how
much
the
bearskin
who
had
sat
beside
her
all
the
morning
and
had
now
turned
her
into
an
object
of
interest
took
a
pride
in
fanny
the
english
upbringing
is
very
interesting
he
said
pushing
back
his
cap
and
letting
out
the
flame
of
his
hair
the
young
ladies
become
very
serious
i
have
been
in
england
i
have
been
in
balham
but
though
owing
to
the
leather
coat
the
others
seemed
to
consider
that
they
had
an
heiress
amongst
them
they
would
not
let
the
big
bearskin
be
her
or
their
instructor
divorce
is
very
easy
in
england
said
the
thin
man
solemnly
and
turned
his
shoulder
slightly
on
the
bearskin
as
though
he
blamed
him
for
his
stay
in
balham
when
the
lunch
was
over
and
the
last
fragment
of
drawn
off
the
last
knife
upon
the
crust
of
bread
that
remained
fanny
restless
hopes
turned
towards
packing
up
but
she
counted
without
the
white
wine
and
the
national
repose
after
the
midday
meal
they
washed
their
cups
with
care
under
the
outlet
tap
of
the
radiator
and
wiping
them
dry
to
the
last
corner
sat
back
under
the
hedge
to
drink
slowly
all
this
time
a
peculiar
quality
had
been
drawing
across
the
sun
it
grew
redder
and
duller
till
blushing
it
died
out
and
fanny
saw
that
the
morning
frost
had
disappeared
out
to
the
left
a
mauve
bank
of
cloud
moved
up
across
the
sky
like
the
smoke
from
a
titanic
bonfire
and
with
the
first
drift
of
moisture
towards
them
the
four
shivered
and
rose
simultaneously
to
pack
the
things
and
put
them
in
the
car
as
fanny
stooped
to
wind
up
the
handle
the
first
snowflake
soft
and
wet
and
heavy
melted
on
her
ear
it
wo
lie
said
the
bearskin
shall
we
draw
up
the
hood
they
drew
it
up
but
the
thin
man
huddling
himself
in
the
corner
of
the
back
seat
insisted
on
as
well
then
i
sorry
will
you
get
out
they
are
under
the
seat
oh
never
mind
my
dear
fellow
said
no
no
one
ought
to
keep
the
warmth
of
food
within
one
and
the
other
got
out
and
stood
shivering
while
the
bearskin
and
fanny
pulled
rugs
and
baskets
and
cushions
out
into
the
road
that
they
might
lift
the
back
seat
and
find
the
curtains
oh
how
torn
exclaimed
the
thin
man
bitterly
as
he
saw
her
drape
the
car
with
leather
curtains
whose
windows
of
mica
had
long
since
been
cracked
and
torn
away
the
snow
was
hissing
on
the
radiator
and
melting
on
the
road
and
there
seemed
no
wind
left
anywhere
to
drive
the
weight
of
the
mauve
cloud
further
across
the
sky
it
hung
solid
and
low
above
them
so
that
between
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
the
floor
of
the
sky
there
was
only
a
foggy
tunnel
in
which
the
road
could
be
seen
a
few
yards
ahead
as
they
drove
forward
the
windscreen
became
filmed
with
melting
snow
fanny
unscrewed
it
and
tilted
it
open
and
the
bearskin
fumbled
unhappily
at
his
collar
to
close
every
chink
and
cranny
in
his
mossy
hide
they
were
climbing
higher
and
higher
across
an
endless
plateau
and
at
last
a
voice
called
from
the
back
we
must
look
at
the
map
it
was
a
voice
of
doubt
and
distrust
that
any
road
could
be
right
road
which
held
so
much
discomfort
fanny
stopped
and
pulled
her
map
from
behind
her
back
where
she
was
keeping
it
dry
it
all
right
she
showed
them
leaning
over
the
back
and
holding
the
map
towards
them
then
she
discovered
that
the
back
seat
was
empty
and
her
clients
were
huddled
among
the
petrol
tins
and
rugs
upon
the
floor
you
must
be
miserable
it
so
much
colder
in
the
back
see
here
the
big
road
that
we
must
avoid
going
off
into
luxembourg
and
here
ours
running
downhill
in
another
mile
they
believed
her
being
too
cramped
and
miserable
to
take
more
than
a
querulous
interest
in
another
the
snow
ceased
and
as
they
glided
down
the
long
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
plateau
in
a
bed
of
fresh
unruffled
wool
the
sun
struck
out
with
a
suddenness
that
seemed
to
tear
the
sky
in
two
and
turned
the
blue
snow
into
a
sheet
of
light
which
stretched
far
below
them
into
a
country
of
pine
woods
and
pits
of
shadow
down
down
they
ran
till
just
below
lay
a
village
if
village
it
was
when
only
a
house
or
two
were
gathered
together
for
company
in
the
forest
the
snow
seemed
to
have
lain
here
for
days
for
the
car
slipped
and
skidded
at
the
steep
entrance
where
the
boys
of
the
village
had
made
slides
for
their
toboggans
a
hundred
feet
from
the
first
house
a
triumphal
arch
was
built
of
pine
and
laurel
across
the
road
on
it
was
written
in
white
letters
soyez
le
bienvenu
all
the
white
poor
houses
glittered
in
the
snow
with
flags
a
stream
crossed
the
village
street
and
a
file
of
geese
on
its
narrow
bridge
brought
her
to
a
standstill
what
are
the
flags
for
she
asked
of
an
old
man
pressing
back
into
a
safety
alcove
in
the
stone
wall
of
the
bridge
we
expect
pétain
here
he
is
coming
to
thionville
but
thionville
is
forty
miles
away
still
he
might
pass
here
running
on
and
on
through
forest
and
hilly
country
they
left
the
snow
behind
them
and
slipped
down
into
greener
valleys
till
at
last
they
came
upon
a
single
american
sentry
and
over
his
head
was
chalked
upon
a
board
this
is
germany
they
pulled
up
germany
it
might
be
but
the
road
to
tréves
he
did
not
know
he
knew
nothing
except
that
with
his
left
foot
he
stood
in
germany
and
with
his
right
in
france
chapter
viii
germany
over
the
side
of
the
next
mountain
all
hans
andersen
was
stretched
before
them
tracts
of
country
little
wooden
houses
with
pointed
roofs
little
hills
covered
with
squares
of
different
coloured
woods
and
a
blue
river
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
white
with
geese
upon
its
banks
they
held
their
open
mouths
insultedly
in
the
air
as
the
motor
passed
the
narrow
road
became
like
marble
and
the
car
hissed
like
a
glass
ball
rolled
on
a
stone
step
on
every
little
hill
stood
a
castle
made
of
brown
chocolate
very
small
but
complete
with
turrets
young
horses
with
fat
stomachs
and
arched
necks
bolted
sideways
off
the
road
in
fear
followed
by
gaily
painted
carts
and
plunged
far
into
the
grassland
at
the
side
old
women
with
coloured
hoods
swore
at
them
and
pulled
the
reins
many
pointed
hills
were
grey
with
and
on
the
crest
of
each
of
these
stood
a
small
chapel
as
if
to
bless
the
wine
the
countryside
was
wet
and
fresh
white
hardly
yellow
with
the
winter
sun
moss
by
the
roadside
still
dripped
from
the
night
and
small
bare
orchard
trees
stood
in
brilliant
grass
look
how
the
grass
grows
in
germany
ah
it
does
grow
like
that
in
the
valley
of
the
meuse
every
cottage
in
every
village
was
different
many
wore
hats
instead
of
roofs
wooden
things
like
steeples
with
deep
eaves
and
carved
fringes
in
which
were
shadowy
windows
like
old
eyes
some
were
pink
and
some
were
yellow
soon
they
left
the
woods
and
came
out
upon
an
open
plateau
surrounded
by
wavy
hills
with
castles
on
them
in
the
middle
of
the
plateau
was
a
zeppelin
shed
which
looked
like
the
work
of
bigger
men
than
the
crawling
peasants
in
the
roads
one
side
of
the
shed
was
open
and
the
strange
predatory
bird
within
insensible
to
the
peering
eye
of
an
enemy
seemed
lost
in
thought
in
this
green
valley
the
camp
of
huts
beside
it
was
deserted
and
there
seemed
to
exist
no
hand
to
close
the
house
door
they
rose
again
on
to
a
hillside
and
on
every
horizon
shone
a
far
blue
forest
faint
like
sea
or
cloud
nearer
tréves
the
villages
were
filled
with
americans
americans
mending
the
already
perfect
roads
and
playing
with
the
children
this
is
a
country
as
it
would
be
in
hans
andersen
thought
fanny
i
thought
the
germans
had
to
mend
the
broken
roads
in
france
they
stayed
that
night
in
the
hotel
which
had
been
turned
into
an
allied
hostel
the
mess
downstairs
was
chiefly
filled
with
american
officers
though
a
few
frenchmen
sat
together
in
one
corner
the
food
was
american
corn
cakes
syrup
and
white
flaky
bread
well
what
bread
it
like
cake
oh
the
americans
eat
well
i
do
agree
with
you
they
put
money
into
their
food
and
they
eat
a
lot
of
it
but
they
ca
cook
is
it
astonishing
what
they
eat
it
astonishing
what
all
the
armies
eat
compared
with
our
soldiers
now
this
i
should
soon
sicken
of
it
but
will
eat
sweets
and
such
things
all
day
long
well
i
told
you
they
are
children
the
americans
here
seem
different
they
behave
better
than
those
in
france
these
are
very
pershing
is
here
this
is
the
headquarters
staff
yes
one
can
see
they
are
different
it
appears
they
get
on
very
well
with
the
germans
hsh
not
so
loud
after
dinner
they
strolled
out
into
the
town
the
bearskin
was
very
anxious
to
get
a
genuine
iron
cross
he
was
offered
iron
crosses
worked
on
matchboxes
on
cigarette
lighters
on
ladies
chains
but
are
they
genuine
he
did
not
know
quite
what
he
meant
i
do
suppose
them
to
be
taken
from
a
dead
man
neck
but
are
they
genuine
in
the
streets
the
germans
sold
iron
crosses
from
job
lots
on
barrows
for
ten
francs
each
but
i
will
get
one
cheaper
said
the
bearskin
and
clambered
up
the
steps
into
shop
after
shop
he
found
an
iron
cross
on
a
chain
for
seven
francs
no
one
knew
what
the
mark
was
worth
and
the
three
men
with
the
german
salesman
bent
over
the
counter
adding
and
subtracting
on
paper
how
can
a
goblin
countryside
breed
people
who
sell
iron
crosses
at
ten
francs
each
wondered
fanny
there
was
a
notice
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
two
doors
down
the
street
on
your
left
and
the
thin
man
stood
in
the
door
of
the
shop
beside
fanny
and
pointed
to
it
could
you
go
there
and
get
me
cigars
they
will
be
very
cheap
have
you
money
with
you
i
try
said
fanny
i
money
we
can
settle
afterwards
inwardly
resolving
to
get
as
many
cigarettes
as
she
could
to
take
back
for
the
men
in
the
garage
she
crossed
the
street
but
looked
back
to
find
the
thin
man
creeping
after
her
she
waited
for
him
irritated
go
back
if
the
american
salesman
sees
you
he
know
it
for
the
french
and
he
wo
sell
tiens
he
knew
that
quite
well
she
thought
impatiently
to
herself
or
he
would
have
asked
me
to
buy
for
him
the
thin
man
turned
back
to
the
cover
of
the
shop
like
an
eager
little
dog
which
has
jumped
too
quickly
for
biscuit
and
been
snubbed
she
went
down
the
street
and
into
the
instantly
she
was
among
three
or
four
hundred
men
who
stood
with
their
backs
to
her
in
queues
up
the
long
wooden
hall
far
ahead
on
the
improvised
counter
was
a
marked
cigars
she
placed
herself
at
the
tail
of
that
queue
move
up
lady
said
the
man
in
front
of
her
moving
her
forward
say
here
a
lady
move
her
up
men
from
the
other
queues
looked
round
and
one
or
two
whistled
slyly
beneath
their
breath
but
her
own
queue
adopted
her
protectingly
and
moved
her
up
to
their
head
against
the
counter
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
get
cigars
now
she
had
become
a
guest
and
to
get
cigars
would
imply
that
she
was
not
buying
for
herself
but
to
supply
an
unknown
man
without
and
the
marks
on
her
uniform
showed
that
the
unknown
was
french
one
carton
of
camels
please
she
said
used
to
the
phraseology
take
two
if
you
like
said
the
salesman
we
just
got
a
dump
in
she
took
two
long
cardboard
packets
of
cigarettes
and
put
down
ten
francs
only
marks
taken
here
said
the
salesman
you
got
to
make
the
change
as
you
come
in
oh
well
i
put
it
down
put
it
here
we
do
get
a
lady
in
every
day
he
gave
her
the
change
in
marks
which
seemed
countless
i
sure
you
given
me
too
much
oh
no
marks
is
goin
just
for
love
in
this
country
makes
you
feel
rich
as
she
emerged
from
the
hall
with
her
two
long
cartons
under
her
arm
she
found
the
thin
man
the
bearskin
and
standing
like
children
on
the
doorstep
it
was
too
much
to
give
her
away
like
that
other
americans
coming
out
looked
at
them
as
a
gentleman
coming
out
of
his
own
house
might
look
at
a
party
of
penguins
on
his
doorstep
fanny
swept
past
her
friends
without
a
glance
and
walked
on
up
the
street
with
her
head
in
the
air
they
turned
and
came
after
her
guiltily
when
they
caught
her
up
in
the
next
street
she
said
to
the
thin
man
i
asked
you
not
to
come
near
while
i
was
buying
have
you
got
cigars
mademoiselle
no
i
could
why
did
you
come
like
that
now
i
can
go
in
no
more
you
only
to
wait
two
minutes
they
looked
crestfallen
while
she
held
the
cigarettes
away
from
them
as
a
nurse
holds
sweets
from
a
naughty
child
i
could
only
get
two
packets
i
can
give
you
one
i
sorry
but
i
promised
to
get
cigarettes
for
some
people
in
metz
the
thin
man
brightened
and
took
the
big
carton
of
camels
with
delight
they
good
those
he
said
knowingly
to
the
others
how
much
were
they
mademoiselle
five
francs
twenty
the
carton
is
it
possible
and
we
have
to
pay
by
his
tone
he
made
it
seem
a
reflection
on
the
americans
why
should
a
country
be
so
rich
when
his
had
been
devastated
so
thinned
so
difficult
to
live
in
fanny
thought
of
the
poor
huddled
clients
who
had
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
car
during
the
snowstorm
it
had
been
a
bitter
journey
for
them
after
all
those
rich
those
pink
and
happy
americans
down
to
the
humblest
private
pockets
full
of
money
and
fat
meals
three
times
a
day
to
keep
their
spirits
up
why
should
they
let
him
have
their
cigarettes
you
can
have
this
carton
too
if
you
like
she
said
offering
it
i
manage
to
slip
in
morning
he
thanked
her
delighted
and
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
the
problem
of
the
kindness
of
the
americans
and
her
frequent
abuse
of
it
to
benefit
the
french
puzzled
her
but
after
all
it
very
easy
to
be
kind
it
much
easier
to
be
kind
if
you
are
american
and
pink
than
if
you
are
french
and
anxious
another
difference
between
the
two
nations
struck
her
the
americans
treat
me
as
if
i
were
an
amusing
child
the
french
no
matter
how
peculiar
their
advances
always
always
as
a
woman
next
morning
when
she
got
down
to
breakfast
at
eight
she
found
that
the
three
frenchmen
had
already
gone
out
about
their
work
perhaps
i
shall
get
home
after
all
she
prayed
she
sat
in
the
hotel
and
watched
the
americans
or
wandered
about
the
little
town
until
eleven
the
affair
with
the
cigars
was
suitably
arranged
the
hall
was
nearly
empty
when
she
went
in
and
the
few
men
who
stood
about
in
it
did
not
disarm
her
with
special
kindness
on
getting
back
to
the
hotel
she
found
the
bearskin
pushing
breathlessly
and
anxiously
through
the
glass
doors
monsieur
raudel
has
left
his
cigarettes
in
his
bedroom
he
said
unlocked
up
he
is
anxious
so
i
have
come
back
well
tell
him
that
if
he
tell
him
quite
as
a
joke
you
know
that
if
i
can
get
home
something
in
his
little
blue
eye
shone
sympathetically
and
she
leant
towards
him
well
i
tell
there
is
a
dance
in
metz
and
i
am
asked
and
tell
him
that
i
have
bought
two
boxes
of
cigars
for
him
the
bearskin
enchanted
promised
to
do
his
best
by
twelve
the
three
were
back
at
lunch
in
the
hotel
over
the
coffee
monsieur
raudel
looked
reflectively
at
his
nails
well
mademoiselle
so
this
is
what
it
is
to
have
a
woman
chauffeur
fanny
looked
up
nervously
regretting
her
confidence
in
the
bearskin
apart
from
the
pleasure
of
your
company
with
us
we
get
cheap
cigars
and
you
get
your
dance
so
every
one
is
pleased
oh
she
was
radiant
but
you
have
hurried
too
much
are
we
really
starting
back
monsieur
raudel
who
was
a
new
man
when
he
was
cold
reassured
her
and
soon
they
were
all
packed
in
the
renault
and
running
out
of
tréves
chapter
ix
the
crinoline
that
same
night
as
dusk
fell
she
shook
the
snow
from
her
feet
and
clothes
and
entered
the
dressmaker
kitchen
four
candles
were
burning
beside
the
gas
and
the
lay
heaped
and
unwashed
upon
the
dresser
murmured
a
number
of
voices
german
and
french
and
the
old
dressmaker
standing
up
her
face
haggard
under
the
gas
took
both
fanny
hands
with
a
whimper
it
will
never
be
done
oh
dear
child
it
will
be
done
the
crinoline
which
they
were
preparing
lay
in
white
rags
upon
the
table
oh
elsa
that
is
good
are
you
helping
too
elsa
had
brought
three
of
her
friends
with
her
and
the
four
bright
bullety
heads
bent
over
the
long
frills
which
moved
slowly
through
their
sewing
fingers
conquered
children
they
were
sewing
like
little
machines
the
fräulein
schneiderin
explained
elsa
is
so
upset
and
this
was
evident
and
needed
no
explaining
the
little
lady
twisted
her
fingers
grieved
and
scolded
snatching
at
this
and
that
and
rapping
with
her
scissors
upon
the
table
as
though
she
were
going
to
wear
the
dress
herself
mademoiselle
i
had
to
get
them
she
nodded
towards
the
busy
conquered
children
apologising
for
them
as
though
she
feared
fanny
might
think
she
had
done
a
deal
with
the
devil
for
her
sake
here
are
my
frills
said
fanny
bringing
from
her
pocket
two
paper
parcels
one
of
which
she
laid
in
mystery
upon
the
table
the
other
opened
and
shook
out
her
two
long
frills
she
drew
off
her
leather
coat
and
sat
down
to
sew

calm
you
are

out
the
dressmaker

so
calm

asked

the
licence

the
old
well

fanny
smiling
he
will
and
what
will
he
wear
oh
it
a
secret
i
do
know
but
i
chose
this
particular
dress
because

is
so
feminine
and

will
be
the
first
time

has
seen
me
in
the
clothes
of
a
woman
children
hurry
hurry
cried
the
dressmaker
in
a
frenzy
of
sympathy
minette
get
down
she
slapped
the
grey
cat
tenderly
as
she
lifted
him
off
the
table
tell
them
in
their
language
to
hurry
she
exclaimed
never
learnt
it
but
after
the
breath
of
excitement
followed
her
poor
despair
and
she
dropped
her
hands
in
her
lap
it
will
never
be
done
i
ca
do
it
look
my
dear
courage
the
bodice
is
already
done
have
you
had
any
tea
the
children
ate
i
could
i
am
too
excited
but
you
are
so
calm
you
have
no
nerves
it
is
natural
yet
she
ate
a
little
piece
of
cake
scolding
the
cat
and
the
children
with
her
mouth
full
prowling
restlessly
above
their
bent
heads
as
they
sewed
and
solidly
sewed
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
the
nine
frills
were
on
the
skirt
the
long
hoops
of
wire
had
been
run
in
and
the
hooks
and
eyes
on
the
belt
often
the
door
opened
and
shut
visitors
came
and
went
in
the
room
the
milk
woman
put
her
head
in
crying
what
a
party
and
left
the
tiny
can
of
milk
upon
the
floor
elsa
mother
came
to
call
her
daughter
to
supper
but
let
her
stay
when
she
saw
the
dress
still
unfinished
now
and
then
some
one
would
run
out
of
the
flat
opposite
the
flat
above
or
the
flat
next
door
and
popping
a
head
in
at
the
door
wish
them
good
luck
all
the
building
seemed
to
know
of
the
crinoline
that
was
being
made
in
the
kitchen
you
do
not
smoke
a
pipe
said
the
dressmaker
softly
with
appreciation
but
none
of
us
do
oh
pardon
yes
i
saw
it
yesterday
a
great
big
girl
dressed
like
you
with
her
hands
in
her
pockets
and
a
pipe
in
her
mouth
it
made
an
effect
on
me
you
can
hardly
believe
how
it
startled
me
i
called
madame
coppet
to
see
i
know
it
was
one
of
us
and
it
seems
rude
of
me
to
say
so
i
even
think
the
woman
you
saw
was
french
oh
my
dear
french
women
never
do
that
well
they
do
when
they
get
free
they
go
beyond
us
in
freedom
when
they
get
it
the
woman
you
saw
i
have
seen
her
too
works
with
the
men
shoulder
to
shoulder
eats
with
them
smokes
with
them
drinks
with
them
drives
all
night
and
all
day
and
they
say
she
can
change
a
tyre
in
two
minutes
there
was
a
woman
too
who
drove
a
lorry
between
verdun
and
not
a
tender
you
know
but
a
big
lorry
she
wore
a
bit
of
old
ermine
round
her
neck
knickerbockers
and
yellow
check
stockings
one
could
imagine
she
had
painted
her
face
by
the
light
of
a
candle
at
four
in
the
morning
she
never
wore
a
hat
and
her
short
yellow
hair
stuck
out
over
her
face
which
was
as
bright
as
a
pink
lamp
shade
terrible
she
may
have
been
but
she
worked
hard
she
was
always
on
that
road
or
she
would
disappear
for
days
with
her
lorry
and
come
back
caked
in
rouge
and
mud
i
wish
i
could
have
got
to
know
her
and
heard
where
she
went
and
the
things
that
happened
to
her
but
my
dear
i
keep
thinking
what
a
strange
life
it
is
for
you
are
you
always
alone
on
your
car
always
alone
you
are
with
men
alone
then
all
the
time
all
the
time
well
it
more
than
i
can
understand
it
part
of
the
war
elsa
bent
across
the
table
and
picked
up
the
folded
bodice
murmuring
that
it
was
done
the
dressmaker
rose
and
reaching
for
the
hooped
skirt
held
it
up
between
her
two
arms
it
was
a
thrilling
moment
fanny
too
rose
put
it
on
a
dummy
she
commanded
candles
were
placed
around
the
dummy
who
seemed
to
step
forward
out
of
the
shades
of
the
kitchen
and
offer
its
headless
body
to
be
hooked
and
buttoned
into
the
dress
all
the
room
stood
back
to
look
and
admire
wie
schön
said
elsa
friends
peering
with
their
mouths
open
ah
dear
child
you
were
so
calm
and
now
it
is
done
said
the
old
dressmaker
the
dress
stood
stiffly
glittering
at
them
white
as
snow
the
nine
frills
pricking
away
from
the
great
hooped
skirt
fanny
picked
up
the
brown
paper
parcel
she
had
laid
on
the
dresser
taking
from
it
a
bottle
of
blue
ink
a
bottle
of
green
and
a
paint
brush
and
diluted
the
inks
in
a
saucer
under
the
tap
there
was
awe
in
the
kitchen
as
she
held
the
brush
filled
with
colour
in
the
air
and
began
to
paint
blue
flowers
on
the
dress
at
the
first
touch
of
the
brush
the
old
dressmaker
clasped
her
hands
what
is
she
doing
the
english
girl
and
we
who
have
kept
it
so
white
hush
said
fanny
stooping
towards
the
bodice
trust
me
the
children
held
their
breath
except
elsa
who
breathed
so
hard
that
fanny
felt
her
hair
stir
on
her
neck
she
covered
the
plain
waisted
bodice
with
dancing
flowers
in
blue
and
green
on
the
frills
of
the
skirt
a
dozen
large
flowers
were
painted
as
though
fallen
from
the
bodice
soon
it
was
done
like
that
in
five
minutes
groaned
the
dressmaker
troubled
by
the
peculiar
growth
of
the
flowers
let
it
dry
said
fanny
i
go
home
and
start
doing
my
hair
elsa
will
bring
it
round
when
it
dry
the
old
woman
held
out
both
her
hands
in
a
gesture
of
mute
congratulation
and
fatigue
now
rest
said
fanny
now
sleep
and
in
the
morning
i
will
come
and
tell
you
all
about
it
and
ran
out
into
the
snow
the
top
hook
of
the
bodice
would
not
meet
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
with
despair
she
pulled
then
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
stared
blankly
before
her
then
if
wo
meet
all
all
the
dress
is
wasted
i
ca
go
no
right
in
the
front
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
to
be
done
she
sat
alone
in
the
room
the
five
candles
she
had
lighted
guttering
and
spilling
wax
she
was
in
the
painted
bodice
and
a
fine
net
petticoat
she
had
bought
at
nancy
even
the
green
silk
bedroom
slippers
were
on
tied
round
her
ankles
with
ribbons
the
only
slippers
she
had
found
in
metz
and
she
had
searched
for
them
for
hours
the
room
was
icy
cold
and
the
hand
of
the
clock
chasing
towards
the
hour
for
the
dance
should
she
go
in
uniform
not
for
the
world
she
would
not
meet
him
and
it
seemed
as
though
there
could
be
no
and
she
would
never
meet
him
again
in
this
world
this
meeting
had
had
a
peculiar
significance
the
flouncy
painted
dress
the
plans
she
had
made
to
meet
him
for
once
as
a
woman
shivering
and
in
absurd
anguish
she
sat
still
on
the
bed
oh
elsa
elsa
look
better
the
child
than
no
one
and
the
shiny
head
was
hanging
round
the
door
wie
schön
but
it
is
look
it
wo
meet
oh
elsa
eyes
grew
round
with
horror
and
she
went
to
fetch
her
mother
tanzen
they
talked
so
much
of
tanzen
in
that
household
the
thin
mother
was
all
sympathy
and
stood
in
helpless
sorrow
before
the
gap
in
the
bodice
what
all
this
and
stood
in
the
doorway
heavy
as
lead
and
red
as
a
plum
give
her
a
bunch
of
flowers
he
said
simply
and
as
if
by
accident
and
oh
said
elsa
mother
and
disappeared
she
came
back
with
three
blue
cotton
cornflowers
out
of
elsa
hat
and
the
gap
in
the
bodice
was
hidden
was
not
her
eyes
flew
round
the
room
searching
the
shadows
in
the
corners
searching
the
faces
in
the
bitterness
of
dismay
she
could
not
fully
enter
the
door
but
stood
a
little
back
blocking
the
entrance
afraid
of
the
certainty
which
was
ready
for
her
within
but
others
less
eager
and
more
hurried
pressed
her
on
drove
her
into
the
centre
of
the
room
and
with
a
voice
of
excitement
and
distress
chattering
within
her
like
some
one
who
has
mislaid
all
he
has
she
shook
hands
with
the
general
who
shrouded
the
personality
of
the
commandant
dormans
at
first
she
could
not
recognise
any
one
as
she
looked
round
upon
turks
clowns
indians
the
tinselled
sequined
beaded
ragged
flutter
of
the
room
then
from
the
coloured
and
composite
clothing
of
a
footballer
clown
or
jockey
grinned
the
round
face
and
owlish
eyes
of
little
duval
who
flew
to
her
at
once
to
whisper
compliments
and
stumble
on
the
swelling
fortress
of
her
white
skirt
she
realised
dimly
from
him
that
her
dress
was
as
beautiful
as
she
had
hoped
it
might
be
but
what
was
the
use
of
its
beauty
if
julien
should
be
missing
and
looking
over
duval
head
she
tried
to
see
through
the
crowd
suddenly
she
saw
him
dressed
in
the
white
uniform
of
a
russian
standing
by
a
buttress
of
the
wall
his
uniform
had
a
faint
yellowish
colour
as
if
it
had
been
laid
away
for
many
years
against
this
evening
dance
the
light
caught
his
knees
and
long
boots
but
the
shadow
of
the
buttress
crept
over
his
face
turned
from
her
towards
a
further
door
on
his
head
he
wore
a
white
hat
of
curling
sheep
wool
which
made
him
seem
fantastically
tall
when
fanny
had
surveyed
him
from
the
tip
of
his
lit
hat
to
his
lit
feet
she
was
content
to
leave
him
in
his
shadowed
corner
and
turned
willingly
to
dance
with
duval
the
little
man
offered
an
arm
to
hold
her
and
as
he
came
nearer
to
her
his
feet
pressed
the
bottom
ring
of
wire
about
her
skirt
and
the
whole
bell
of
flowers
and
frills
swung
backwards
and
stood
out
obliquely
behind
her
presently
the
jew
boy
reherrey
detached
himself
from
the
others
and
came
out
to
stand
by
her
and
flatter
her
he
had
wound
the
black
stuff
that
he
had
bought
three
days
before
so
cleverly
round
his
slim
body
that
he
seemed
no
fatter
than
a
lacquered
hairpin
the
cynical
flattery
of
this
jew
the
plunging
admiration
which
duval
breathed
at
her
side
the
attentive
look
in
the
bright
eyes
of
the
commandant
dormans
who
had
come
near
them
and
stood
before
her
filled
her
with
joy
she
looked
about
her
bright
rat
tiny
and
enormous
in
her
own
sight
aware
now
of
her
outer
now
of
her
inner
life
and
sipped
her
meed
of
success
full
of
the
light
happiness
fashioned
from
the
admiration
of
creatures
no
bigger
than
herself
she
laughed
at
one
and
the
other
bending
towards
them
listening
to
what
they
had
to
say
without
denying
without
doubts
with
only
triumph
in
her
heart
and
the
group
shifting
a
little
a
voice
was
able
to
say
secretly
at
her
ear
you
look
beautiful
but
you
are
not
exclusive
her
sense
of
triumph
was
not
dimmed
because
her
quick
ear
caught
jealousy
shading
the
reproach
in
his
voice
she
did
not
answer
him
except
to
look
at
him
but
they
seemed
to
forgive
each
other
mutually
as
the
figure
of
moved
close
enough
to
tilt
the
bell
skirt
and
take
the
figure
of
into
his
arms
and
dance
with
her
calico
and
sheep
wool
and
painted
flowers
went
down
the
room
under
the
low
gas
brackets
and
her
eyes
avoiding
his
looked
out
from
a
little
personal
silence
into
the
whirl
of
the
room
and
heard
the
dimmed
music
and
the
scrape
of
feet
for
him
the
world
was
a
pale
and
she
the
absorbing
centre
for
her
the
world
without
was
lit
equally
with
his
personality
the
glamour
of
which
hung
over
all
the
scenes
before
her
eyes
with
the
weight
of
the
sky
over
the
land
so
long
as
he
lit
the
horizon
the
very
furthest
object
in
it
wore
a
shaft
of
his
light
upon
its
body
they
danced
on
not
wearing
away
the
shining
boards
with
their
feet
half
so
much
as
they
wore
away
the
thin
ice
above
the
enchanted
lake
the
commandant
dormans
crossed
the
room
to
them
she
must
be
drawn
she
must
go
for
her
portrait
spare
me
your
partner
mademoiselle
we
have
an
artist
a
drawing
some
of
the
dresses
will
you
come
with
me
and
sit
for
yours
she
went
into
the
little
room
and
stood
for
the
drawing
the
door
shut
on
her
and
she
and
the
artist
faced
each
other
through
the
door
the
music
came
softly
and
as
she
stood
hands
resting
without
a
stir
on
fold
on
frill
head
bent
and
wandering
eyes
the
artist
with
twitching
face
and
moving
hand
looked
up
and
down
up
and
down
and
she
sank
swaying
a
little
upon
her
rooted
feet
into
a
hypnotised
tranquillity
she
did
not
care
what
the
man
put
upon
the
white
paper
with
his
flying
hands
he
might
draw
the
flowers
upon
her
skirt
but
not
the
tall
blooming
flowers
within
her
growing
fabulously
like
the
lilies
in
a
dream
her
thoughts
went
out
to
meet
the
waves
of
music
floating
through
the
door
her
rooted
body
held
so
still
that
she
no
longer
felt
it
and
her
spirit
hung
unbodied
in
an
exaltation
between
love
which
she
remembered
and
love
which
she
expected
no
one
came
through
the
door
they
left
her
in
silence
enclosed
in
the
cell
of
the
room
and
of
her
dreams
and
she
was
content
to
stand
without
movement
without
act
or
thought
the
near
chair
the
wall
hard
by
the
golden
room
which
she
had
just
left
so
suddenly
were
alike
to
her
her
eyes
and
her
imagination
were
tuned
to
the
same
level
and
there
was
no
distinction
between
what
was
on
her
horizon
and
beyond
it
across
the
face
of
the
artist
the
scenes
in
the
room
behind
her
passed
in
unarrested
procession
and
the
voice
of
an
illusory
lover
in
her
ear
startled
her
by
its
clearness
the
music
wandered
about
the
room
like
visible
movement
and
the
artist
god
bless
him
never
opened
his
mouth
between
his
shower
of
tiny
glances
finished
mademoiselle
and
he
held
the
drawing
towards
her
as
he
leant
back
with
a
sigh
he
had
made
too
many
drawings
that
evening
and
any
talent
he
had
hung
in
his
mind
as
wearily
as
a
flag
in
an
airless
room
with
an
effort
she
broke
her
position
and
moved
towards
him
taking
up
the
drawing
in
her
hand
with
a
forced
interest
yes
thank
you
thank
you
she
said
and
he
took
it
back
and
laid
it
with
the
pile
he
had
made
you
do
like
it
but
i
so
tired
look
at
these
others
i
did
earlier
in
the
evening
but
while
she
bent
over
them
the
door
burst
open
and
dormans
came
in
followed
by
duval
and
dennis
is
it
finished
let
me
look
yes
yes
very
good
quite
good
they
were
pleased
enough
and
drew
the
artist
away
with
them
to
the
buffet
suddenly
julien
was
with
her
and
had
closed
the
door
he
was
hurried
excited
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
said
what
he
could
no
longer
contain
as
though
the
thought
biggest
in
his
mind
broke
in
a
bound
from
him
he
was
white
and
he
exclaimed
it
terrible
how
you
could
hurt
me
if
you
would
he
seemed
to
close
his
eyes
a
little
then
and
lean
his
head
towards
her
she
looked
at
the
drooping
head
and
she
knew
that
she
had
him
without
fear
of
escape
knew
too
that
the
moment
was
brief
their
recent
undeclared
silence
brooded
as
though
still
with
them
half
regretful
and
departing
angel
you
will
have
other
beauties
she
said
to
her
heart
but
none
like
this
silence
they
were
breathless
the
ice
had
gone
from
the
lake
and
the
ship
had
not
yet
set
sail
in
a
dream
she
moved
down
to
the
beach
she
saw
him
open
his
eyes
and
stare
at
her
incredulously
i
am
going
to
break
this
beauty
she
breathed
alone
and
put
out
her
hand
and
launched
the
ship
he
was
by
her
side
the
silence
broken
the
voyage
begun
chapter
x
fanny
robbed
and
rescued
clouds
yellow
mauve
and
blue
hung
ominously
over
the
road
to
nancy
the
valley
was
filled
with
shades
but
the
road
itself
gleamed
like
a
bleached
bone
in
a
ditch
seated
upon
the
dashboard
of
her
wounded
car
fanny
had
drummed
her
heels
for
warmth
since
morning
and
seemed
likely
soon
to
drum
them
upon
a
carpet
of
snow
beneath
the
car
a
dark
stream
of
oil
marked
the
road
and
the
oil
still
dripped
from
the
differential
case
where
the
back
axle
lay
in
two
halves
i
will
telephone
to
your
garage
her
client
had
promised
as
he
climbed
on
to
a
passing
lorry
and
continued
his
journey
into
nancy
with
that
she
had
to
be
content
while
she
waited
first
without
her
lunch
and
then
without
her
tea
for
the
breakdown
lorry
which
his
telephone
message
would
eventually
bring
to
her
aid
now
it
was
nearly
four
she
had
been
hungry
but
was
hungry
no
longer
the
bitter
cold
made
her
forehead
ache
and
though
every
moment
the
blue
and
mauve
shades
thickened
upon
the
sky
no
flake
of
snow
had
fallen
only
last
night
only
hours
ago
she
had
been
preparing
for
the
dance
and
only
last
night
she
had
said
to
julien
what
had
she
said
to
julien
what
had
he
said
to
her
again
she
was
deep
in
a
reverie
that
had
lasted
all
day
that
had
kept
her
warm
had
fed
her
she
was
almost
asleep
when
a
man
voice
woke
her
and
she
found
a
car
with
three
americans
drawn
up
beside
her
i
guess
this
is
too
bad
said
the
man
who
had
woken
her
we
passed
you
this
morning
on
our
way
into
nancy
and
here
you
are
still
looking
as
though
you
had
never
moved
you
had
any
food
since
then
i
have
been
so
very
hungry
not
hungry
you
sure
past
being
hungry
lucky
we
got
food
with
us
in
the
car
pity
we
got
to
hurry
but
here
sandwiches
and
sandwiches
and
cakes
and
candy
and
bits
of
bunstuff
and
an
apple
and
here
a
cheese
that
running
out
of
its
wrappin
when
your
show
coming
to
fetch
you
you
coming
home
along
with
us
they
wo
be
long
now
oh
you
are
good
fanny
hunger
revived
as
she
took
the
food
and
now
she
was
waiting
ungratefully
for
them
to
be
gone
that
she
might
start
on
her
heavensent
meal
they
cried
together
she
waved
and
as
their
car
passed
onwards
she
climbed
up
on
to
the
mudguard
and
spread
the
rug
over
her
knees
the
slow
night
grew
out
of
nothing
expanded
and
nearly
enveloped
the
slopes
of
the
hill
below
the
wind
dropped
in
the
cloudy
heavy
twilight
and
the
papers
of
the
sandwiches
did
no
more
than
rustle
upon
her
knees
not
prepared
yet
to
light
her
car
lamps
fanny
laid
her
torch
upon
her
lap
and
its
patch
of
white
light
lit
her
hands
and
the
piles
of
bread
cake
and
fancy
buns
across
the
road
in
the
deeper
gloom
that
dyed
the
valley
and
spilt
over
its
banks
a
head
rustled
in
the
ragged
border
of
twig
and
reed
and
eyes
watched
the
meal
which
seemed
to
hang
suspended
above
the
vague
shape
of
the
motor
car
with
a
sense
of
being
perfectly
alone
walled
round
by
the
gathering
dusk
fanny
made
a
deep
inroad
upon
her
sandwiches
and
cake
finishing
with
the
apple
and
began
to
roll
up
what
remained
in
case
of
further
need
should
no
one
come
to
fetch
her
she
reflected
that
her
torch
would
not
last
her
long
and
that
she
ought
to
put
it
and
light
her
head
and
tail
lamps
instead
but
drowsy
with
pleasure
in
her
lonely
dinner
she
sat
on
prolonging
the
last
moments
before
she
must
uncurl
her
feet
and
climb
down
on
to
the
ground
the
torch
slipped
from
her
knee
on
to
a
lower
fold
of
the
rug
lighting
only
the
corner
of
a
packet
in
which
she
had
rolled
the
cake
suddenly
while
she
watched
it
the
gleam
of
the
corner
disappeared
she
stared
at
the
spot
intensely
and
saw
a
hand
a
shade
lighter
than
the
darkness
travel
across
the
surface
of
the
rug
cover
with
its
fingers
the
second
parcel
and
draw
it
backwards
into
what
had
now
become
dense
night
her
skin
stirred
as
though
a
million
antennae
were
alive
upon
it
she
could
not
breathe
lest
any
movement
should
fling
the
unknown
upon
her
her
eyes
were
glued
to
the
third
packet
and
in
a
moment
the
hand
advanced
again
with
horror
she
saw
it
creep
along
the
rug
a
small
brown
fibrous
hand
worn
with
work
the
third
packet
was
eclipsed
by
the
fingers
and
receded
as
the
others
had
done
but
as
it
reached
the
edge
of
the
rug
overflowing
horror
galvanised
her
into
movement
and
catching
the
corners
of
the
rug
she
threw
it
violently
after
the
package
and
over
the
hand
at
the
same
moment
jumping
from
her
seat
and
on
to
the
footboard
to
grope
wildly
for
the
switch
her
heart
was
leaping
like
a
fish
just
flung
into
a
basket
and
every
inch
of
her
body
winced
from
an
expected
grasp
upon
it
she
flung
herself
over
the
side
and
into
the
seat
of
the
car
found
the
switch
and
pushed
it
a
dozen
chinese
at
least
were
caught
in
the
two
long
beams
that
flew
out
across
the
darkness
for
a
second
their
wrinkled
faces
stared
eyes
blinked
and
short
unhollowed
lips
stretched
over
yellow
teeth
then
with
a
flutter
of
dark
garments
the
chinese
started
away
from
the
fixed
beams
and
were
gone
into
the
shadow
except
for
the
sudden
twitter
of
a
voice
the
spurt
of
a
stone
flung
up
against
the
metal
of
the
car
they
melted
silently
out
of
sight
and
hearing
sick
with
panic
fanny
leant
down
upon
her
knees
and
covered
her
head
with
her
two
arms
expecting
a
blow
from
above
seconds
passed
and
with
one
leg
gone
to
sleep
she
lifted
her
head
switched
off
the
lights
and
stared
into
the
night
she
could
see
nothing
and
gradually
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
she
found
that
they
had
completely
disappeared
the
rug
too
had
gone
and
all
three
packets
of
sandwiches
cautiously
with
trembling
legs
she
stepped
upon
the
footboard
something
hit
her
softly
upon
the
forehead
but
before
she
had
time
to
suffer
from
a
new
fear
her
eye
caught
the
glitter
of
a
flake
of
snow
in
its
parachute
descent
across
the
path
of
her
lamps
they
hate
snow
she
whispered
not
knowing
whether
it
was
true
she
tried
to
picture
them
as
a
band
of
workmen
who
content
with
their
little
pillage
were
now
far
from
her
on
their
way
to
some
encampment
finding
the
torch
still
caught
between
the
mudguard
and
the
bonnet
she
prowled
round
the
car
flashing
it
into
corners
and
pits
of
darkness
there
was
no
sign
of
a
lurking
face
or
flutter
of
garment
snow
began
to
fall
patting
her
noiselessly
on
her
face
and
hands
and
curling
faster
and
faster
across
the
lights
in
twenty
minutes
the
road
around
her
was
lightened
and
cones
of
delicate
softness
grew
between
the
spokes
of
the
wheels
climbing
down
again
from
her
perch
fanny
went
to
the
back
of
the
car
and
taking
from
beneath
the
seat
her
box
of
tools
she
groped
in
the
hollow
under
the
wood
and
pulled
out
an
iron
bar
stout
and
slightly
bent
with
a
knob
at
one
end
the
handle
of
the
wheel
jack
far
away
in
what
seemed
another
world
equally
blind
snowy
and
obscure
but
divided
from
this
one
by
fathoms
of
frozen
water
a
car
was
coming
out
from
on
to
the
main
nancy
road
its
two
glowed
confusedly
under
the
snow
that
clung
to
them
and
the
driver
his
thick
blue
coat
buttoned
about
his
chin
leant
forward
peering
through
the
open
windscreen
stung
blinded
and
blinking
as
the
flakes
drove
in
the
swept
the
road
the
range
of
the
beams
reaching
out
and
climbing
the
tree
trunks
in
sheltered
spots
or
flung
back
and
huddled
about
the
front
wheels
when
a
blast
of
fresh
snow
was
swept
in
from
the
open
valley
on
the
left
we
must
be
getting
to
marbashe
hardly
yet
it
was
unlucky
the
should
be
at
thionville
i
could
have
mended
the
spring
on
the
lorry
myself
but
it
wants
two
men
to
tow
in
the
car
this
is
marbache
in
the
shelter
of
the
hamlet
the
lights
leapt
forward
and
struck
a
handful
of
houses
thickened
and
rounded
with
snow
almost
immediately
darkness
swallowed
them
up
and
a
drift
of
snow
flung
up
by
the
wind
burst
in
powder
over
the
bonnet
and
on
to
the
glass
the
plain
outside
now
we
go
down
a
long
hill
we
turn
sharp
to
the
right
here
the
car
entered
a
tunnel
of
skeleton
trees
through
which
the
flakes
drained
and
flickered
or
broke
in
uneven
gusts
through
the
trunks
the
left
lamp
touched
a
little
wooden
hut
which
stood
blinkered
and
deserted
just
beyond
it
was
a
sharp
turn
in
the
road
what
that
a
pale
light
hung
in
the
dark
ahead
of
them
is
it
a
car
no
yes
lamps
with
the
beam
broken
by
the
snow
go
slow
for
fear
of
blinding
the
driver
of
a
lighted
vehicle
which
might
after
all
be
moving
one
of
the
men
put
out
his
hand
and
switched
off
the
headlights
and
the
car
glided
forward
on
its
own
momentum
thus
they
came
upon
fanny
in
the
hollow
torn
by
the
lamps
out
of
an
obscurity
which
whirled
like
a
dense
pillar
above
her
seated
on
her
mudguard
blanched
and
still
as
an
image
the
iron
bar
for
a
weapon
in
her
right
hand
the
torch
ready
as
a
signal
in
her
left
julien
well
yes
my
poor
child
and
she
saw
the
man
behind
him
and
laughed
help
me
down
within
and
without

am
set
in
plaster

look
like
a
poor
goddess
or
an
old
stone
pillar
with
a
face
be
careful
that
leg
will
not
stand
oh
look
look
how
the
snow
clings
it
frozen
on
my
lap
we
must
be
quick
everything
must
be
quickly
done
or
we
shall
all
stay
here

a
spring

and
they

value
into
the
other
car
when
they
had
finished
the
night
air
was
clear
of
snowflakes
hill
road
and
valley
were
lit
by
the
pallor
of
the
fallen
snow
fanny
followed
julien
to
the
other
car
he
swung
the
handle
and
jumped
into
the
driving
seat
come
he
said
and
held
out
a
hand
pichot
we
send
for
you
early
in
the
morning
mademoiselle
they
moved
forward
and
the
moon
like
a
wandering
lamp
lit
their
faces
blow
out
old
moon
said
julien
turning
his
silvered
face
and
hair
up
to
the
sky
the
moon
flew
behind
a
cloud
quick
he
said
what
and
kissed
her
the
jacks
and
tyres
and
wheels
and
bolts
fluttered
out
of
fanny
head
like
black
ravens
and
disappeared
they
flew
on
over
the
bridge
at
up
the
shining
ruinous
street
crouch
lower
said
julien
if
any
one
wanted
to
they
could
count
your
eyelashes
from
the
windows
ah
yes
if
there
was
any
one
to
count
she
glanced
up
at
the
fragmentary
pronged
chimneys
the
dark
unstirring
caves
of
brick
soon
the
church
clocks
of
metz
rang
out
quarrelling
out
of
time
with
one
another
do
you
know
this
is
going
to
last
said
julien
suddenly
as
if
the
clocks
had
reminded
him
she
turned
swiftly
towards
him
the
grand
quartier
is
moving
ah
you
knew
you
had
heard
no
no
she
shook
her
head
but
do
you
think
i
have
thought
of
it
i
keep
thinking
ca
stay
here
for
ever
some
end
will
come
and
then
will
come
this
way
the
grand
quartier
will
go
but

are
going

miles
away
but

than
that

up
and
all

to
come
sixteen
miles
round
to
chantilly
by

bridge

in
despair
about

i

to
fix
upon
another
village
but
he
is
obstinate
and
précy
it
must
be
for
you

me
but
let
think
of
it
now

till

warm
and

can
plan
here

the
gates
he
handed
out
the
paper
pass
as
a
red
light
waved
to
and
from
upon
the
snow
first
the
germans
still
in
their
ancient
civic
uniform
nothing
to
declare
then
the
little
soldier
with
the
lantern
in
his
hand
your
pass
belle
as
he
caught
sight
of
julien
pardon
mademoiselle
lastly
up
the
long
road
into
the
open
square
by
the
station
down
the
narrow
street
splashing
the
melted
against
the
shop
windows
and
under
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
put
the
car
away
and
come
and
dine
with
me
at

she
looked
at
him
astonished

car

to
our
garage

future

beautiful
renault

brand

laughed

or

will
faint
with
hunger
put
it
away
and
come
just
as
you
are
to
moitriers
up
into
the
balcony
i
am
going
there
first
to
order
a
wonderful
dinner
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
sitting
behind
the
wooden
balustrade
of
the
balcony
at
moitriers
the
only
diners
on
the
little
landing
that
overhung
the
one
fashionable
restaurant
in
metz
it
was
a
quarter
to
nine
down
below
the
room
which
was
lined
with
mirrors
set
in
gilt
frames
was
filled
with
light
knives
and
forks
still
tapped
upon
the
plates
but
the
hour
being
late
many
diners
leant
across
the
strewn
tablecloths
and
talked
or
sat
a
little
askew
in
their
chairs
and
listened
a
hum
filled
the
warm
air
and
what
was
garish
below
here
behind
the
balustrade
became
filtered
and
strained
to
delicate
streaks
and
bars
of
light
which
crossed
and
recrossed
their
cloth
their
hands
their
faces
what
was
noisy
below
was
here
no
more
than
a
soft
insect
bustle
a
murmurous
background
to
their
talk
the
door
of
the
balcony
opened
behind
them
and
madame
berthe
the
proprietress
herself
moved
at
their
side
her
body
shaped
like
an
was
clothed
in
rucked
black
silk
which
flowed
over
her
like
a
pigment
flowed
from
her
chin
to
the
floor
upon
which
it
lay
stiffly
in
hills
and
valleys
of
braided
hem
her
gay
gold
tooth
gleamed
and
the
gold
in
her
ears
wagged
as
she
fed
them
gently
on
omelette
chicken
and
tinned
peas
and
a
ice
they
talked
a
little
sleepy
after
the
wind
smiling
at
each
other
do
you
want
more
light
than
that
said
madame
berthe
coming
in
again
softly
with
the
coffee
fanny
shook
her
head
not
any
more
than
this
then
they
were
left
alone
stirring
the
coffee
gazing
down
between
the
wooden
columns
at
the
diners
below
of
what
are
you
thinking
she
asked
as
a
sigh
escaped
her
companion
the
move
to
chantilly
i
am
so
loth
to
break
up
all
this
break
up
ah
well
it
changes
does
it
even
if
it
is
no
longer
the
same
landscape
it
changes
after
a
silence
he
added
how
fragile
it
is
what
you
he
covered
her
hand
with
both
his
you
what
i
think
you
are
and
what
you
think
i
am
love
and
illusion
too
fragile
to
be
given
to
us
with
our
blunders
and
our
nonsense
she
watched
him
silent
and
he
went
on
i
do
understand
this
life
that
why
i
keep
quiet
and
smile
as
you
say
i
do
there
are
often
things
i
do
say
when
i
smile
what
things
oh
i
wonder
how
much
you
believe
me
and
i
listen
to
that
immense
interior
life
which
talks
such
a
different
language
i
to
move
on
to
chantilly
suddenly
she
recognised
that
they
were
at
a
corner
which
he
had
wanted
her
to
turn
for
days
there
had
been
something
he
had
hinted
at
something
he
wanted
to
tell
her
he
chafed
at
some
knowledge
he
had
which
she
did
not
share
which
he
wanted
her
to
share
once
he
had
said
i
had
letters
this
morning
which
worried
me
yes
one
in
particular
it
hurt
me
it
gave
me
pain
but
she
had
not
wanted
to
ask
what
was
in
the
letter
then
he
had
grown
restless
sighed
and
turned
away
but
soon
they
had
talked
again
and
it
had
passed
and
now
he
said
look
how
detached
we
are
in
this
town
which
is
like
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
we
behave
as
though
we
had
no
past
lives
and
never
expected
any
future
especially
you
especially
i
you
behave
as
though
i
was
born
the
day
before
you
met
me
and
would
die
the
day
after
you
leave
me
you
never
ask
anything
about
me
you
tell
me
nothing
about
yourself
we
might
be
a
couple
of
stars
hanging
in
mid
air
shining
at
each
other
and
then
i
have
the
feeling
that
one
might
drop
and
the
other
would
know
where
to
look
for
it
but
after
a
little
silence
the
truth
burst
out
and
he
said
with
despair
do
you
want
to
know
about
me
yes
that
was
all
very
well
she
did
she
did
but
not
just
this
that
was
coming
and
then
he
told
her
what
is
she
like
violette
fair
after
several
low
questions
she
seemed
to
stand
between
them
like
a
child
thin
and
fair
delicate
and
silent
innocently
expecting
to
be
spared
all
pain
no
she
does
go
out
very
much
she
stays
indoors
and
does
her
hair
and
her
nails
and
reads
a
little
book
and
have
you
known
her
for
a
long
time
a
long
time
after
this
they
pretended
that
she
did
not
exist
and
the
little
wraith
floated
back
to
paris
from
which
she
had
come
suddenly
on
days
when
she
had
written
him
certain
letters
which
had
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
chapter
xi
the
last
night
in
metz
the
journey
fanny
turned
again
to
seek
the
lights
of
the
town
and
the
dagger
points
of
the
churches
that
climbed
against
the
sky
upon
the
hill
behind
her
but
all
that
met
her
eyes
was
the
blanket
of
wet
darkness
and
the
shimmer
of
the
snowflakes
under
the
lamps
she
slipped
through
the
garage
gates
touching
the
iron
bars
almost
for
the
last
time
but
what
does
it
matter
all
towns
are
the
same
and
we
sing
the
same
song
in
each
and
wear
the
same
coloured
feathers
she
stirred
the
snow
in
the
yard
with
her
foot
an
inch
already
and
the
renault
has
so
little
grip
upon
the
snow
shall
we
be
able
to
start
then
she
set
out
to
look
for
a
heap
of
snow
chains
which
she
had
noticed
before
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
not
far
from
her
another
little
torch
moved
in
the
darkness
and
under
its
downward
ray
she
caught
sight
of
a
khaki
skirt
and
a
foot
someone
else
has
thought
of
chains
too
and
there
are
so
few
she
clicked
off
her
light
and
moved
stealthily
along
the
forest
of
cars
her
fingers
sweeping
blankets
of
snow
from
the
mudguards
passing
the
first
line
of
she
saw
the
light
again
she
in
the
wrong
place
she
thought
and
hurried
on
those
bags
of
chains
are
just
behind
the
berliet
they
brought
in
backwards
behind
the
berliet
little
mounds
showed
in
the
snow
she
stooped
over
them
shading
her
light
with
her
knees
and
dug
in
the
light
powder
with
her
hand
pulling
out
a
small
canvas
bag
which
she
dusted
and
beat
with
her
fingers
are
you
looking
for
chains
she
called
to
the
other
light
her
bag
safely
in
her
arms
yes
they
are
here
here
in
this
corner
who
are
you
cried
the
voice
but
she
slipped
away
in
silence
to
the
garage
door
for
on
this
last
black
and
white
night
in
metz
she
longed
to
creep
about
unspoken
to
unquestioned
a
little
soldier
sat
on
guard
by
a
brazier
of
glowing
charcoal
near
the
door
she
nodded
to
him
as
she
moved
down
the
long
line
of
cars
to
her
own
there
it
stood
the
light
of
the
brazier
falling
faintly
upon
it
the
two
points
of
the
windscreen
standing
up
like
the
ready
ears
of
an
interested
dog
the
beautiful
lines
of
its
body
long
bonnet
and
mudguards
stretched
like
a
greyhound
at
a
gallop
at
rest
until
the
dawn
she
flung
the
bag
of
chains
inside
and
patting
the
bonnet
slipped
away
and
out
into
the
street
without
attempting
to
try
the
fit
of
the
chains
upon
the
wheels
she
slept
a
last
night
in
the
dark
red
german
room
three
streets
away
first
making
a
little
tour
of
the
walls
in
her
nightgown
the
candle
flame
waving
from
her
hand
the
hot
wax
running
in
a
cascade
over
her
fingers
and
looked
at
the
stag
horn
fastened
to
the
bracket
and
the
cluster
of
christmas
postcards
pinned
to
the
wall
the
postcards
arrested
her
attention
and
a
light
darted
in
her
mind
they
were
dark
postcards
encrusted
with
shiny
frosting
like
the
snow
outside
little
birds
and
goblins
a
wreath
of
holly
and
a
house
with
red
mica
windows
were
designed
on
them
she
put
out
a
finger
and
gently
touched
the
rough
bright
common
stuff
standing
opposite
them
almost
breathless
with
a
wave
of
memory
she
could
see
herself
no
taller
than
the
nursery
fireguard
with
round
eyes
to
which
every
bright
thing
was
a
desire
she
could
feel
herself
very
small
amid
the
bustle
and
clatter
of
christmas
blowing
dark
breath
marks
against
the
bright
silver
on
the
table
pulling
the
fringe
round
the
iced
cake
wetting
her
finger
and
picking
up
hundreds
and
thousands
with
it
from
a
bag
these
postcards
now
in
front
of
her
were
made
by
some
one
with
the
mind
of
a
child
it
struck
and
shook
her
violently
with
memory
to
see
them
that
why
the
germans
write
good
fairy
stories
she
thought
and
her
eyes
passed
to
the
framed
photographs
that
hung
near
the
postcards
pictures
of
soldiers
in
uniform
sitting
at
a
table
with
the
two
daughters
of
the
house
but
these
wooden
faces
these
bodies
pressing
through
unwieldy
clothes
seemed
unrelated
to
the
childish
postcards
she
went
contentedly
to
her
bed
the
room
bare
of
all
her
belongings
except
the
one
bag
that
stood
filled
and
open
upon
the
table
sleeping
for
the
last
time
in
the
strange
bed
in
the
strange
town
which
she
might
never
see
again
it
was
time
indeed
to
go
for
days
past
civilians
had
crept
through
the
gates
of
metz
leading
old
horses
drawing
ramshackle
carts
filled
with
mattresses
faded
silk
chairs
gilt
ormolu
stands
clocks
and
cloaks
and
parrot
cages
all
the
strange
things
that
men
and
women
use
for
their
lives
the
furniture
that
had
fled
in
other
carts
from
villages
now
dust
upon
a
dead
plain
was
returning
through
all
the
roads
of
france
repacked
and
dusted
to
set
up
the
spirit
of
civilian
life
again
it
was
time
to
go
following
all
the
other
birds
of
passage
that
war
had
dragged
through
the
town
of
metz
time
to
make
way
for
the
toiling
civilian
with
his
impedimenta
of
civilisation
in
the
morning
when
she
opened
her
eyes
the
room
was
darker
than
usual
and
the
opening
of
the
window
but
the
merest
square
of
light
snow
was
built
up
round
the
frame
in
thick
rolls
four
inches
high
she
dressed
hurriedly
and
rolled
up
the
with
her
few
last
things
inside
it
out
in
the
street
the
snow
was
dry
and
thick
and
beautifully
untrodden
the
garage
gates
looked
strange
with
a
thick
white
banner
blown
down
each
side
of
the
pillars
she
looked
inside
the
garage
shed
yes
all
the
cars
had
gone
hers
stood
alone
the
suitcases
inside
tyres
pumped
stiff
and
solid
the
hood
well
buckled
back
mademoiselle
has
gone
with
the
convoy
said
the
des
aghast
oh
i
separate
she
laughed
but
the
convoy
is
gone
i
know
it
but
i
not
with
them
it
an
order
i
going
alone
but
do
you
know
the
route
i
not
going
by
it
he
laughed
suddenly
giving
up
all
attempt
at
responsibility
and
bent
to
catch
her
starting
handle
oh
do
worry
yes
it
your
last
day
i
may
as
well
help
you
to
go
away
the
engine
started
easily
and
she
drove
out
of
the
garage
into
the
yard
the
wheels
flying
helplessly
in
the
snow
and
flinging
up
dry
puffs
like
flour
have
you
chains
said
the
des
but
she
smiled
and
nodded
and
could
not
wait
to
all
the
garage
she
nodded
and
waved
the
sun
broke
out
from
behind
a
cloud
her
brass
and
glass
caught
fire
and
twinkled
gaily
the
snow
sparkled
the
shone
at
her
she
left
the
garage
without
a
regret
in
her
heart
with
not
a
thought
in
her
head
save
that
in
a
minute
she
would
be
safe
no
accident
could
stop
her
she
would
be
abroad
upon
the
magic
the
unbelievable
journey
they
were
in
a
small
circular
room
shaped
like
an
english
oasthouse
its
roof
running
upwards
in
a
funnel
to
meet
the
sky
at
the
apex
was
a
round
porthole
of
thick
glass
to
let
in
the
light
but
as
this
was
supporting
several
feet
of
snow
the
lighting
of
the
room
was
effected
only
by
a
large
which
stood
on
the
blackened
table
in
the
centre
an
old
woman
came
forward
into
the
light
of
the
lamp
her
eyes
were
fine
and
black
her
mouth
was
toothless
and
folded
away
for
ever
lost
in
a
crevice
under
her
nose
when
she
smiled
the
of
her
cheeks
rose
up
and
cut
the
black
eyes
into
hoops
we
are
on
a
long
journey
madame
to
chantilly
we
are
cold
can
we
have
coffee
she
drew
out
chairs
and
bade
them
sit
then
placed
two
tall
glasses
of
coffee
in
the
ring
of
light
from
the
lamp
sugar
melting
in
a
sandy
heap
at
the
bottom
of
each
what
an
odd
shape
your
house
is
said
julien
looking
round
him
it
very
old
like
me
and
the
light
is
poor
you
have
to
know
it
to
get
used
to
it
she
replied
you
only
that
one
window
he
stared
up
the
funnel
to
where
he
could
see
the
grey
underside
of
the
cone
of
snow
but
i
can
make
that
one
better
than
it
is
and
then
the
lady
can
see
herself
in
this
little
glass
the
old
woman
moved
to
the
side
of
the
wall
where
a
rope
hung
down
a
since
she
has
a
gentleman
with
her
i
was
the
same
and
even
not
so
long
ago
she
put
up
her
thin
arm
and
gave
the
rope
a
long
pull
she
must
have
been
strong
for
the
skylight
and
all
its
burden
opened
on
a
hinge
and
the
snow
could
be
seen
sliding
from
it
could
be
heard
in
a
heavy
body
rumbling
on
the
roof
she
closed
the
skylight
and
now
a
wan
light
filtered
down
the
funnel
and
turned
their
faces
green
it
was
like
life
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
and
they
felt
as
though
the
level
of
the
earth
was
far
above
their
heads
and
its
weighty
walls
pressing
against
their
sides
but
why
is
it
built
this
way
many
houses
are
said
the
old
woman
with
a
shrug
it
old
older
than
my
mother
she
sat
down
beside
them
soldiers
have
been
drunk
in
here
many
times
in
the
war
she
said
and
in
the
old
war
too
but
i
never
saw
one
like
you
she
pinched
fanny
sleeve
fine
stuff
she
said
the
americans
are
rich
i
not
american
rich
they
are
but
i
do
care
for
them
they
have
no
real
feeling
for
a
woman
you
are
not
stupid
to
get
a
frenchman
for
a
lover
do
make
him
vain
it
is
the
truth
he
knows
it
very
well
why
should
he
be
vain
an
american
loves
a
pretty
face
but
a
frenchman
loves
what
is
a
woman
she
rose
and
lifted
the
lamp
and
let
its
ray
search
out
a
corner
of
the
room
wherein
the
great
bed
stood
wooden
and
square
its
posts
black
with
age
its
bedding
puffed
about
it
and
crowned
with
a
scarlet
eiderdown
as
solid
and
deep
as
the
bed
itself
a
fine
bed
an
old
bed
it
is
possible
that
you
will
not
believe
me
but
i
shared
that
bed
with
a
bishop
not
two
years
ago
fanny
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
bed
julien
laughed
in
the
worst
sense
mother
in
the
best
my
son
bragged
the
old
woman
sliding
a
skinny
finger
to
the
tip
of
her
nose
you
do
believe
me
coming
nearer
she
stood
with
the
lamp
held
in
her
two
hands
resting
on
the
table
so
that
she
towered
over
them
in
fluttering
shawl
and
shadow
he
arrived
in
the
village
one
night
in
a
great
storm
it
was
past
the
new
year
and
soldiers
had
been
coming
through
the
street
all
day
to
go
up
to
the
lines
beyond
i
had
them
sleeping
in
here
on
the
floor
in
rows
clearing
away
the
table
and
lying
from
wall
to
wall
so
thick
that
i
had
to
step
on
them
when
i
crossed
the
room
with
my
lamp
but
that
night
there
were
none
they
were
all
passing
through
up
to
the
front
lines
and
though
the
other
end
of
the
village
was
full
no
one
knocked
here
there
was
snow
as
there
is
but
not
lying
still
on
the
ground
it
was
rushing
through
the
air
and
choking
people
and
lying
heavy
on
everything
that
moved
outside
that
glass
of
mine
up
there
was
too
heavy
for
me
to
move
so
i
let
it
be
a
knock
came
at
the
door
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
when
i
got
up
to
unbar
the
door
there
was
a
soldier
on
the
doorstep
i
said
you
going
to
wake
me
up
every
night
to
fill
the
room
with
men
and
he
said
mother
only
one
pass
in
monsieur
it
was
a
bishop
as
i
told
you
a
great
big
man
with
a
red
face
shining
with
the
snow
if
he
had
not
been
white
with
snow
he
would
have
been
as
black
as
a
rook
he
stamped
on
the
cobbles
by
the
door
and
the
snow
went
down
off
him
in
heaps
and
there
he
was
in
his
beautiful
long
clothes
and
i
said
to
myself
shall
i
do
with
him
not
the
floor
for
such
a
man
so
there
we
were
i
in
my
red
shawl
that
hangs
on
the
hook
there
and
he
in
his
long
clothes
like
a
black
baby
in
arms
and
his
big
man
face
staring
at
me
over
the
top
ca
put
you
anywhere
but
in
my
bed
i
told
him
i
told
him
like
that
quickly
that
he
might
know
and
he
answered
like
a
gentleman
the
lord
save
his
soul
what
lady
could
do
more
there
only
one
bed
i
told
him
i
told
him
to
make
it
clear
i
not
young
enough
to
sleep
on
the
floor
not
that
i
an
old
woman
and
he
answered
like
a
gentleman
the
lord
save
him
i
will
tell
the
end
said
the
old
woman
drawing
near
to
julien
as
he
took
some
money
from
his
pocket
to
pay
for
the
coffee
two
hours
later
they
drew
up
at
a
in
the
main
square
at
ligny
within
was
a
gentle
murmur
of
voices
a
smell
of
soup
and
baking
bread
warm
steam
the
glow
of
oil
lamps
and
reddened
faces
sitting
at
a
small
table
with
a
white
cloth
among
the
american
soldiers
who
having
long
finished
their
lunch
were
playing
cards
and
dominoes
they
ordered
an
omelette
white
wine
brille
cheese
and
their
own
ration
of
bully
beef
which
they
had
brought
in
tins
to
be
fried
with
onions
a
woman
appeared
from
the
door
of
the
kitchen
carrying
their
bowl
of
across
the
plains
of
her
great
chest
shone
a
white
satin
waistcoat
fastened
with
blue
glass
studs
and
above
her
handsome
face
rose
a
crown
of
hair
dyed
in
two
shades
of
scarlet
a
little
maid
followed
and
they
covered
the
table
with
dishes
knives
and
forks
bread
and
wine
the
woman
beamed
upon
fanny
and
julien
and
laying
her
hand
upon
fanny
shoulder
begged
them
not
to
eat
till
she
had
fetched
them
a
glass
of
her
own
wine
you
bet
it
good
advised
a
big
american
sergeant
at
a
table
near
them
you
take
it
she
brought
them
a
wine
which
shone
like
dark
amber
in
a
couple
of
glasses
and
stood
over
them
listening
with
pleasure
to
their
appreciation
while
each
slight
movement
of
her
shoulders
sent
ripples
and
rivers
of
heaving
light
over
the
waistcoat
of
satin
the
butter
round
the
omelette
was
bubbling
in
the
dish
the
brille
had
had
its
red
rind
removed
and
replaced
by
fried
breadcrumbs
the
white
wine
was
light
and
sweet
and
with
the
coffee
afterwards
they
were
given
as
much
sugar
as
they
wished
i
have
seen
her
before
somewhere
said
julien
as
the
scarlet
head
receded
among
the
shadows
of
the
back
room
i
wonder
where
one
would
forget
her
no
it
might
have
been
in
paris
it
might
have
been
anywhere
the
little
maid
was
at
his
elbow
madame
would
be
glad
if
you
would
come
to
her
store
and
make
your
choice
of
a
cigar
monsieur
well
i
shall
know
where
i
met
her
do
you
mind
if
i
go
he
followed
the
girl
into
the
back
room
fanny
searching
in
her
pocket
for
her
handkerchief
scattered
a
couple
of
german
iron
pennies
on
the
floor
an
american
from
the
table
behind
picked
them
up
and
returned
them
to
her
these
things
are
just
a
weight
and
a
trouble
he
said
i
think
i
shall
throw
mine
away
you
come
down
from
germany
then
been
up
at
trêves
they
do
you
well
up
there
not
better
than

no
this
is
an
exception
it
a
good
place
madame
is
a
great
manager
hev
you
got
more
german
pennies
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
said
the
american
sergeant
who
had
advised
her
to
drink
the
wine
because
if
you
hev
so
hev
i
and
i
play
you
at
dominoes
for
them
as
julien
did
not
return
at
once
fanny
moved
to
his
table
and
piled
her
german
pennies
beside
her
and
they
picked
out
their
dominoes
from
the
pile
i
want
to
go
home
said
the
american
and
lifted
up
his
big
face
and
looked
at
her
you
all
do
that
right
we
all
do
assented
another
and
another
they
would
make
this
statement
to
her
at
every
village
where
she
met
them
in
every
at
any
puncture
on
the
road
over
which
they
helped
her
simply
and
because
it
was
the
only
thing
in
their
minds
do
you
hev
to
come
out
here
he
enquired
oh
no
we
come
because
we
like
to
thinking
this
a
trumpery
remark
he
made
no
answer
but
put
out
another
domino
then
as
though
something
about
her
still
intrigued
his
heavy
curiosity
you
with
the
french
ai
you
yes
like
that
too
he
sat
a
little
back
into
his
chair
as
though
he
felt
he
had
put
her
in
a
corner
now
and
when
she
said
she
even
liked
that
too
twitched
his
cheek
a
little
in
contempt
for
such
a
lie
and
went
on
playing
but
the
remark
worked
something
in
him
for
five
minutes
later
he
pursued
i
do
see
anything
in
the
french
they
ai
clean
they
generous
they
ai
nor
comfortable
fanny
played
out
her
domino
they
do
know
how
to
he
said
more
violently
than
he
had
spoken
yet
what
living
she
said
quickly
what
is
it
to
live
if
know
you
want
to
put
yourself
at
something
an
build
up

up
your
fortune

and
be

it
mademoiselle

said
julien
in
the
doorway
to
the
woman
in
the
back
room
and
fanny
jumped
up
the
american
passed
four
iron
coins
across
the
table
is
going
to
hinder
that
fortune
i
going
to
make
he
said
smiling
at
last
what
do
i
know
she
asked
approaching
the
doorway
and
moving
with
him
into
the
back
room
madame
owns
a
house
in
verdun
said
julien
and
i
tell
her
you
know
it

it

and
drink
this
little
glass
of
my
wine
mademoiselle
said
the
woman
and
tell
me
about
my
poor
little
house
i
had
a
house
on
the
crown
of
the
hill
with
a
good
view
and
a
good
situation
she
laughed
by
the
cathedral
had
you
well
there
are
a
great
many
by
the
cathedral
fanny
answered
cautiously
for
she
thought
she
knew
the
house
that
was
meant
but
my
house
looked
out
on
the
and
stood
very
high
on
a
rock
below
it
there
was
a
drop
and
steep
steps
went
down
to
a
street
below
had
you
pink
curtains
in
the
upper
windows
is
it
not
then
so
damaged
demanded
the
woman
eagerly
dropping
her
smile
the
curtains
are
left
you
can
see
the
curtains
no
no
it
is
terribly
damaged
if
it
is
the
house
you
mean
i
found
a
piece
of
pink
satin
and
a
curtain
ring
under
a
brick
and
there
is
a
sad
piece
which
still
waves
on
a
high
window
but
wait
a
minute
excuse
me
i
be
back
she
passed
through
the
café
and
ran
out
to
the
car
returning
in
a
moment
with
something
in
her
hand
i
fear
i
looted
your
house
madame
she
said
offering
her
a
small
cylindrical
pot
made
of
coarse
clouded
glass
and
half
filled
with
a
yellowish
paste
i
found
that
inside
on
the
ground
floor
i
do
know
why
i
took
it
the
woman
held
it
in
her
hand
oh
she
wailed
and
sliding
down
upon
the
sofa
found
her
handkerchief
non
said
julien
you
who
have
so
much
courage
but
it
was
my
own
she
cried
incoherently
holding
out
the
little
pot
my
poor
little
cream
pot
what
it
was
my
face
cream
how
strange
i
had
not
used
it
for
a
week
because
they
had
recommended
me
a
new
one
ah
miraculous
that
so
small
a
thing
should
follow
me
she
touched
her
eyes
carefully
with
her
handkerchief
but
a
live
tear
had
fallen
on
the
waistcoat
tell
me
mademoiselle
sit
down
beside
me
my
dear
the
poor
little
house
is
no
more
good
to
me
i
could
live
there
is
there
a
roof
you
could
live
in
it
but
the
roof
it
was
on
the
point
of
sliding
off
it
was
worn
like
a
hat
over
one
ear
the
front
of
the
house
is
gone
only
on
the
frame
of
one
window
which
sticks
to
the
wall
could
i
see
your
piece
of
pink
curtain
which
waves
my
poor
pretty
house
she
mused
my
first
you
know
she
said
in
an
undertone
to
julien
ah
well
courage
as
you
say
but
you
are
very
well
here
true
but
this
is
my
vocation
i
shall
start
again
elsewhere
and
verdun
itself
mademoiselle
can
one
live
in
it
no
not
yet
perhaps
never
well
well
madame
we
must
move
on
again
interrupted
julien
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
night
the
woman
rose
and
turning
to
a
drawer
pulled
out
a
heap
of
soiled
papers
bills
and
letters
wait
she
said
wait
an
instant
turning
them
over
she
sought
and
found
a
couple
of
old
sheets
pinned
together
and
unpinning
them
she
handed
one
to
fanny
it
is
the
receipt
for
the
cream
she
said
that
i
want
to
give
you
it
is
a
good
cream
though
i
left
the
pot
behind
the
sun
sank
and
the
forests
around
chantilly
grew
vague
and
deep
white
statues
stood
by
the
roadside
and
among
the
trees
chateaux
with
closed
eyes
slept
through
the
winter
every
tree
hung
down
beneath
its
load
of
snow
the
telephone
wires
drooped
like
worsted
threads
across
the
road
fanny
who
had
left
julien
at
his
new
billets
in
chantilly
drove
on
alone
to
the
little
village
on
the
oise
which
was
to
be
her
home
it
was
not
long
before
she
could
make
out
the
posts
and
signals
of
the
railway
on
her
left
and
the
river
appeared
in
a
broad
band
below
her
the
moon
rose
and
in
the
river
the
reeds
hung
head
downwards
staring
up
at
the
living
reeds
upon
the
bank
precy
it
gleamed
upon
a
signpost
and
turning
down
a
lane
on
the
left
she
came
on
a
handful
of
unlighted
cottages
and
beyond
them
a
single
village
street
soundless
and
asleep
a
chemist
shop
full
of
coloured
glasses
was
lit
from
within
by
a
single
candle
upon
the
step
the
chemist
stood
a
skull
cap
above
his
large
pitted
face
somewhere
in
the
shuttered
village
a
roof
already
sheltered
her
companions
but
before
looking
for
them
she
drew
up
and
gazed
out
beyond
the
river
and
the
railway
line
to
where
the
moon
was
slowly
lighting
hill
after
hill
but
the
spectral
summer
town
which
she
sought
was
veiled
in
the
night
part
iii
the
forests
of
chantilly
chapter
xii
the
light
of
dawn
touched
paris
the
wastes
of
snow
surrounding
her
forests
villages
scattered
in
the
forest
and
plains
around
senlis
chantilly
boran
précy
the
dark
receded
in
the
west
in
the
east
a
green
light
spread
upwards
from
the
horizon
touched
the
banks
of
the
black
oise
the
roofs
of
the
houses
of
précy
the
dark
window
panes
and
the
flanks
of
the
granite
piers
that
stood
beheaded
in
the
water
all
that
was
left
of
the
great
bridge
that
had
crossed
from
bank
to
bank
above
the
river
stood
the
station
hut
and
the
wooden
gates
of
the
level
crossing
upon
which
the
night
lantern
still
hung
above
again
a
strip
of
snow
divided
the
railway
line
from
the
road
at
the
other
side
of
whose
stone
wall
the
village
itself
began
and
stretched
backwards
up
a
hill
upon
a
patch
of
snow
above
the
river
and
below
the
road
stood
a
flourishing
little
house
covered
with
gables
and
turrets
and
odd
shapes
like
the
of
staircases
climbed
unexpectedly
about
the
roof
in
summer
fresh
with
paint
the
outside
of
the
house
must
wave
its
vulgar
little
hands
into
the
sky
but
now
everything
that
bristled
upon
it
served
only
as
a
fresh
support
for
the
snow
which
hung
in
deep
drifts
on
its
roof
and
around
its
balconied
windows
it
stood
in
its
own
symmetrical
walled
garden
like
a
cup
in
a
deep
saucer
and
within
the
wall
a
variety
of
humps
and
hillocks
showed
where
the
bushes
crouched
beneath
their
unusual
blanket
one
window
facing
towards
the
railway
and
the
river
had
no
balcony
clinging
to
its
stonework
and
in
the
dark
room
behind
it
the
light
of
the
dawn
pressed
faintly
between
the
undrawn
curtains
a
figure
stirred
upon
the
bed
within
and
fanny
not
clearly
aware
whether
she
had
slept
or
not
longed
to
search
the
room
for
some
heavier
covering
which
warming
her
would
let
her
sink
into
unconsciousness
her
slowly
gathering
wits
together
with
the
nagging
cold
forced
her
at
last
from
the
high
bed
on
to
the
floor
and
she
crossed
the
room
towards
the
light
in
the
walled
garden
below
strange
lights
of
dawn
played
red
green
and
amber
like
a
crop
of
flowers
the
railway
lines
beyond
the
garden
wall
disappeared
in
fiery
bands
north
and
south
lights
flashed
down
from
the
sky
above
and
winked
in
the
black
and
polished
river
at
the
limit
of
the
white
plain
beyond
a
window
caught
the
sun
and
turned
its
upon
the
snow
chantilly
a
word
like
the
dawn
filled
with
light
and
the
promise
of
light
turning
back
into
the
dim
room
she
flung
her
coat
upon
the
bed
climbed
in
and
fell
asleep
three
hours
later
something
pressed
against
her
bed
and
she
opened
her
eyes
again
the
room
was
fresh
with
daylight
and
stewart
standing
beside
her
carried
a
rug
on
her
arm
and
wore
a
coat
over
her
nightgown
i
coming
down
to
have
chocolate
in
your
room
fanny
watched
her
stewart
climbed
up
beside
her
wrapped
in
the
rug
a
knock
at
the
door
heralded
the
entry
of
a
woman
carrying
a
tray
fanny
watched
her
too
and
saw
that
she
was
fresh
smiling
clean
and
big
and
that
steam
flew
up
in
puffs
from
the
tray
she
carried
the
woman
pulled
a
little
table
towards
the
bed
and
set
the
tray
on
it
this
is
madame
boujan
said
stewart
voice
fanny
tried
to
smile
and
say
good
morning
and
succeeded
she
was
not
awake
but
knew
she
was
in
clover
the
cups
holding
the
steaming
chocolate
were
as
large
as
bowls
and
painted
cherries
and
leaves
glistened
beneath
their
lustre
surface
beside
the
cups
was
a
plate
with
rolls
four
rolls
and
there
were
knives
and
two
big
pots
which
must
be
butter
and
jam
wake
up
fanny
rolled
nearer
to
the
chocolate
sniffed
it
and
pulled
herself
up
in
bed
the
woman
still
smiling
beside
them
turned
and
hunted
among
the
clothes
upon
the
chair
then
held
a
jersey
towards
her
shoulders
and
guided
her
arms
into
its
sleeves
ecstasy
stole
over
fanny
other
similar
wakings
strung
themselves
like
beads
upon
her
memory
nursery
wakings
when
her
spirit
had
been
guided
into
daylight
by
the
crackle
of
a
fire
by
the
movements
of
just
such
an
aproned
figure
as
this
by
a
smile
on
just
such
a
pink
face
or
wakings
after
illness
when
her
freshening
life
had
leapt
in
her
at
the
sound
of
a
blind
drawn
up
at
the
sight
of
the
hand
that
pulled
the
cord
oh
heavenly
woman
who
stood
beside
the
tray
who
fed
her
and
warmed
her
while
she
was
yet
weak
and
babyish
from
sleep
beyond
her
the
white
plains
of
beauty
shone
outside
the
window
she
sat
up
and
smiled
i
awake
she
said
and
madame
boujan
having
seen
that
her
feet
were
set
upon
the
threshold
of
day
went
out
of
the
door
and
closed
it
softly
they
held
the
lustre
bowls
cupped
in
their
hands
and
sipped
during
lunch
in
the
little
villa
while
they
were
all
recounting
their
experiences
madame
boujan
came
softly
to
fanny
side
and
whispered
a
soldier
has
brought
you
a
note
from
chantilly
keep
it
for
me
in
the
kitchen
fanny
answered
under
her
breath

herself
to
potatoes

the
bedroom

to

side
of
the
broken
bridge
and
trusts
to
me
to
find
a
boat
come
over
the
level
crossing
to
the
river
they
passed
the
station
hut
and
came
to
a
little
landing
stage
near
which
a
boat
was
tied
there
a
boat
said
stewart
shall
we
ask
at
that
hut
the
wooden
hut
stood
above
their
heads
on
a
pedestal
of
stone
from
its
side
the
haunch
of
the
stone
bridge
sprang
away
into
the
air
but
stopped
abruptly
where
it
had
been
broken
off
the
hut
once
perhaps
a
was
on
a
level
with
what
had
been
the
height
of
the
bridge
and
now
it
could
be
reached
by
stone
steps
which
wound
up
to
a
small
platform
in
front
of
the
door
from
within
came
men
voices
singing
look
in
here
a
flickering
light
issued
from
a
small
window
and
having
climbed
the
steps
they
could
see
inside
two
boys
about
sixteen
a
soldier
and
an
old
man
sat
round
a
table
beneath
a
hanging
lamp
and
sang
from
scraps
of
paper
which
they
held
in
their
hands
behind
the
old
man
a
girl
stood
cleaning
a
cup
with
a
cloth
they
are
practising
something
knock
but
there
was
no
need
for
a
dog
chained
in
a
barrel
close
to
them
set
up
a
wild
barking
is
he
chained
keep
this
side
the
old
man
is
coming
the
door
opened
the
voices
ceased
the
girl
stood
by
the
old
side
yes
it
could
be
arranged
people
still
crossed
that
way
their
boat
was
a
sort
of
ferry
and
there
was
a
charge
there
might
be
a
little
fog
but
it
did
matter
margot
knows
the
way
across
blindfold
margot
would
row
the
lady
she
would
be
waiting
with
a
lantern
at
five
minutes
to
seven
and
again
at
nine
not
too
late
at
all
but
margot
would
not
wait
on
the
other
side
it
was
too
cold
they
would
lend
the
lady
a
whistle
and
she
must
blow
on
it
from
the
far
bank
there
romance
said
fanny
as
they
came
away
not
if
you
are
caught
there
my
magic
luck
how
dare
you
ask
like
that
even
if
you
are
not
superstitious
even
if
you
do
believe
a
word
of
it
why
be
so
defiant
why
not
set
the
signs
right
oh
my
dear
stewart
i
hardly
care
and
to
the
creature
who
care
no
suspicion
clings
have
i
an
honest
face
would
you
think
it
was
me
me
of
all
the
section
to
cross
the
river
in
a
little
boat
with
a
lantern
to
creep
out
of
the
house
out
of
the
village
to
dine
forbidden
in
chantilly
with
some
one
who
enchants
me
you
would
why
do
you
know
if
i
lived
up
in
their
house
under
their
eyes
i
would
go
out
just
the
same
to
cross
the
river
i
would
climb
by
windows
or
invent
a
wild
tale
to
soothe
them
but
open
the
door
and
shut
the
door
and
be
gone
and
would
anybody
say
fanny
they
might
they
might
but
they
would
answer
their
own
question
sleeping
innocently
working
innocently
darning
reading
writing
i
do
suspect
myself
so
why
should
any
one
else
suspect
me
fanny
broke
off
and
laughed
come
along
and
cut
wood
they
moved
off
into
the
woods
as
people
with
not
a
care
in
the
world
and
coming
upon
a
stack
of
great
logs
which
had
been
piled
by
some
one
else
began
to
steal
one
or
two
and
drag
them
away
into
a
deep
woodland
drive
where
they
could
cut
them
up
without
fear
of
being
noticed
they
worked
on
for
an
hour
and
then
stewart
drew
a
packet
of
cake
from
her
coat
pocket
and
sitting
upon
the
logs
they
had
their
tea
soon
fanny
wringing
her
hands
cried
i
blue
again
stiff
again
letting
the
cold
in
letting
the
snow
gnaw
where
the
hatchet
for
a
time
she
chopped
and
hacked
and
stewart
shepherding
the
splinters
which
flew
into
the
snow
piled
them
splinters
most
precious
of
all
to
set
a
fire
alight
and
the
afternoon
grew
bluer
deeper
stewart
worked
in
a
reverie
fanny
in
a
heat
of
expectation
one
mused
reposedly
on
life
the
other
warmly
of
the
immediate
hours
before
her
now
i
going
to
fetch
the
car
said
stewart
at
last
will
you
stay
here
and
go
on
cutting
till
i
come
there
are
two
more
logs
she
walked
away
up
the
drive
and
fanny
picked
the
hatchet
out
of
the
snow
and
started
on
the
leathery
damp
end
of
a
fresh
log
it
would
not
split
the
tapping
marred
the
white
silence
and
yet
again
she
let
the
hatchet
fall
and
sat
down
on
the
log
instead
it
was
nearly
six
they
had
spent
the
whole
afternoon
splitting
up
the
logs
and
making
a
fine
pile
of
short
pieces
for
firewood
the
forest
was
darkening
rapidly
blue
deepened
above
the
trees
to
indigo
and
black
settled
among
the
trunks
only
the
snow
sent
up
its
everlasting
shine
her
thoughts
fell
and
rose
now
they
were
upon
the
ground
busy
with
a
multitude
of
small
gleams
and
sparkles
now
they
were
up
and
away
through
the
forest
tunnels
to
chantilly
what
would
he
say
first
how
look
when
he
met
her
ah
i
am
a
silly
woman
in
a
fever
yet
happy
for
i
see
beauty
in
everything
in
the
world
upon
strange
faces
in
nights
and
days
upon
what
passes
behind
the
glassy
eyes
she
pressed
her
own
depends
sight
or
no
sight
there
is
a
life
within
life
and
only
i
she
thought
arrogantly
her
peopled
world
bounded
by
her
companions
am
living
in
it
we
are
afraid
we
are
ashamed
but
when
one
dares
talk
of
this
strange
ecstasy
other
people
nod
their
heads
and
say
yes
we
know
about
that
they
are
in
love
and
they
smile
but
what
a
convention
tradition
that
smile
there
was
no
sound
in
the
forest
at
all
not
the
cry
of
a
bird
not
the
rustle
of
snow
falling
from
a
branch
but
there
was
something
deeper
and
remoter
than
sound
the
approach
of
night
there
was
a
change
on
the
face
of
the
forest
an
effective
silence
which
was
not
blankness
a
voiceless
expression
of
attention
as
the
newcomer
settled
into
his
place
fanny
looked
up
and
saw
the
labyrinth
of
trees
in
the
very
act
of
receiving
a
guest
oh
what
wretched
earnest
i
am
in
she
thought
suddenly
chilled
and
it
can
only
have
one
end
parting
but
she
had
a
power
to
evade
these
moods
she
could
slip
round
them
and
say
to
herself
i
am
old
enough
i
have
learnt
again
and
again
that
there
is
only
one
joy
the
present
only
one
perfection
the
present
if
i
look
into
the
future
it
is
lost
she
heard
the
returning
car
far
up
the
forest
drive
and
in
a
moment
saw
the
gleam
of
its
two
lamps
as
they
rocked
and
swayed
it
drew
up
and
stewart
put
out
the
lamps
ever
remembering
that
their
logs
were
stolen
there
was
still
light
enough
by
which
they
could
pack
the
car
with
wood
as
they
finished
stewart
caught
her
arm
look
a
fire
she
said
pointing
into
the
forest
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
they
could
see
a
red
glow
which
burst
up
over
the
horizon
and
look
behind
the
trees
the
whole
sky
is
illumined
what
a
fire
as
they
watched
the
glare
grew
stronger
and
brighter
and
seemed
about
to
lift
the
very
tongue
of
its
flame
over
the
horizon
it
the
moon
they
cried
together
the
cold
moon
it
was
who
had
come
up
red
and
angry
from
some
olympic
quarrel
and
hung
like
a
copper
fire
behind
the
forest
branches
up
and
up
she
sailed
but
paling
as
she
rose
from
red
to
orange
from
orange
to
the
yellow
of
hay
and
at
yellow
she
remained
when
the
last
branch
had
dropped
past
her
face
of
light
and
she
was
drifting
in
the
height
of
the
sky
chapter
xiii
the
inn
they
drove
back
to
the
village
and
down
to
their
isolated
villa
and
here
on
the
road
they
passed
ones
and
twos
of
the
section
walking
into
supper
how
little
we
have
thought
out
your
evasion
whispered
stewart
at
the
wheel
as
they
drew
up
at
the
door
get
out
and
go
and
dress
i
will
take
the
car
up
to
the
garage
and
come
back
fanny
slipped
in
through
the
garden
what
they
called
dressing
was
a
clean
skirt
and
silk
stockings
but
silk
stockings
she
dared
not
put
on
before
her
brief
appearance
at
supper
stuffing
the
little
roll
into
her
pocket
she
determined
to
change
her
stockings
on
the
boat
soon
before
supper
was
ended
she
had
risen
from
the
table
unquestioned
by
the
others
had
paused
a
moment
to
meet
stewart
eye
full
of
mystery
and
blessing
had
closed
the
door
and
was
gone
she
slipped
down
the
road
and
across
the
field
to
the
railway
there
was
a
train
standing
glowing
and
breathing
upon
the
lines
and
the
driver
called
to
her
as
she
ran
round
the
buffers
of
the
engine
soon
she
was
down
by
the
riverside
and
looking
for
margot
though
there
was
moonlight
far
above
her
the
river
banks
were
wrapped
in
fog
that
smelt
of
water
and
margot
face
at
the
hut
window
was
white
and
her
wool
dress
white
too
she
came
down
and
they
rowed
out
into
the
fog
in
an
upward
circle
because
of
the
stream
fanny
could
just
see
her
companion
little
blunt
boots
the
stretched
laces
across
her
instep
and
above
her
pretty
face
and
slant
eyes
hurriedly
in
the
boat
she
pulled
off
the
thick
stockings
rolled
them
up
and
drew
on
the
silk
a
chill
struck
her
feet
she
wrapped
the
ends
of
her
coat
lightly
round
her
knees
and
as
she
did
so
the
roll
of
thick
stockings
sprang
out
of
her
lap
and
fell
overboard
into
the
fog
and
the
river
mademoiselle
goes
to
a
party
said
margot
who
had
not
noticed
the
soft
sympathetic
voice
was
as
full
of
blessing
as
stewart
eyes
had
been
yes
to
a
party
and
you
will
fetch
me
back
when
i
whistle
yes
blow
three
times
for
sometimes
in
the
singing
at
home
i
lose
the
sound
the
opposite
bank
seemed
to
drift
in
under
the
motionless
boat
and
she
sprang
out
a
tout
à
mademoiselle
at
the
top
of
the
bank
the
road
ran
out
into
the
fog
which
was
thicker
on
this
side
she
walked
along
it
and
was
lost
to
margot
incurious
eyes
here
it
was
utterly
deserted
since
the
bridge
had
been
blown
up
the
road
had
become
disused
and
only
the
few
who
passed
over
by
margot
boat
ever
found
their
way
across
these
fields
she
strayed
along
by
the
road
edge
and
could
distinguish
the
blanched
form
of
a
tree
strange
that
the
fog
should
reach
so
much
further
inland
on
this
side
of
the
river
perhaps
the
ground
was
lower
standing
still
her
ear
caught
a
rich
high
throaty
sound
a
choking
complaint
which
travelled
in
the
air
it
is
the
car
she
thought
far
away
a
patch
of
light
floated
in
the
sky
like
an
uprooted
searchlight
that
is
the
fog
bending
the
headlights
upward
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
road
and
listened
to
the
sound
as
it
drew
nearer
and
nearer
till
suddenly
the
headlights
came
down
out
of
the
sky
and
pierced
her
she
stood
washed
in
light
and
the
car
stopped
beside
the
driver
of
the
car
was
not
julien
but
a
man
with
a
red
wooden
face
like
a
hindoo
god
made
out
of
mahogany
saluting
he
said
we
are
sent
to
fetch
you
mademoiselle
he
held
the
door
of
the
closed
car
open
for
her
she
smiled
nodded
climbed
in
and
sank
upon
the
seat
when
you
get
to
the
lights
of
the
houses
mademoiselle
will
you
stoop
a
little
and
cover
yourself
with
this
rug
it
is
not
foggy
in
chantilly
and
the
street
is
very
full
i
will
she
said
i
kneel
down
something
about
his
face
distressed
her
how
came
it
that
julien
trusted
this
new
man
perhaps
he
was
some
old
and
private
friend
of
his
who
felt
antagonistic
to
her
who
disbelieved
in
her
who
would
hurt
them
both
with
his
cynical
impassivity
i
fanciful
she
thought
this
is
only
some
friend
of
his
from
paris
paris
sending
forth
obstacles
already
in
chantilly
she
crouched
beneath
the
rug
her
expectations
closing
unwandering
against
her
breast
beams
might
pierce
the
glass
of
the
car
and
light
nothing
unusual
what
burnt
beneath
was
not
a
fire
that
man
could
see
generals
in
the
street
walked
indifferently
to
the
hotel
of
the
grand
condé
it
was
their
dinner
hour
and
who
cared
that
an
empty
car
should
move
towards
a
little
inn
beyond
now
she
held
armfuls
of
the
rug
about
her
buried
from
the
light
now
held
her
breath
too
as
the
car
stopped
now
mademoiselle
and
there
stood
julien
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
whom
she
had
left
sombre
and
distracted
a
long
hours
ago
in
chantilly
she
saw
the
change
even
while
she
flew
to
him
he
was
gay
he
was
excited
he
was
exciting
he
was
beautiful
admirable
he
admired
her
fanny
is
it
true
you
have
come
and
que
vous
êtes
en
beauté
within
a
table
was
laid
for
three
three
chairs
three
plates
three
covers
he
saw
her
looking
at
this
we
dine
three
you
must
condescend
to
dine
with
a
sergeant
my
old
friend
where
is
alfred
i
am
here
my
old
friend
four
years
before
the
war
the
oldest
friend
i
have
he
has
heard
of
violette
he
has
heard
of
violette
he
is
violette
friend
he
is
against
me
i
am
so
glad
she
said
aloud
in
a
small
voice
and
put
out
her
hand
she
did
not
like
him
she
had
an
instant
dread
of
him
and
thought
he
beheld
it
too
i
did
not
even
know
he
was
here
said
julien
more
gay
than
ever
but
he
is
the
sergeant
of
the
garage
and
i
find
him
again
what
a
help
you
be
to
say
the
least
of
it
you
will
drive
her
to
the
river
you
will
fetch
her
from
the
river
i
myself
can
not
drive
i
am
not
allowed
the
impassive
man
thus
addressed
looked
neither
gay
nor
sad
his
little
eyes
wandered
to
fanny
with
a
faint
critical
indifference
julien
has
made
a
mistake
a
mistake
he
is
an
enemy
she
could
not
clearly
decide
how
much
she
should
allow
her
evening
to
be
shadowed
by
this
man
how
deeply
she
distrusted
him
but
julien
was
far
from
distrusting
him
through
the
dinner
he
seemed
silently
to
brag
to
alfred
his
look
said
and
his
smile
said
is
she
not
this
and
that
alfred
is
she
not
perfect
his
blue
eyes
were
bright
and
once
he
said
go
on
talk
fanny
talk
fanny
you
have
an
audience
you
have
two
to
dazzle
impossible
to
dazzle
alfred
could
he
not
see
that
one
might
as
easily
dazzle
a
mahogany
god
a
little
god
alive
beneath
its
casing
with
a
cold
and
angry
life
yet
though
at
first
she
was
silent
inclined
to
listen
to
alfred
to
hope
that
something
in
his
tones
would
soothe
her
enemy
fears
soon
she
could
not
help
following
julien
mood
should
she
want
to
be
praised
she
had
it
from
his
eye
or
be
assured
of
love
it
was
there
too
in
the
eye
the
smile
the
soft
tone
because
of
alfred
he
could
put
nothing
into
words
because
he
must
be
dumb
she
could
read
a
more
satisfying
conversation
in
his
face
she
began
to
think
the
occasional
presence
of
a
third
person
was
an
addition
an
exciting
disturbance
a
medium
through
which
she
could
talk
with
ease
two
languages
at
once
french
to
alfred
and
love
to
julien
when
they
had
finished
dining
alfred
left
them
promising
to
come
back
with
the
car
in
half
an
hour
to
take
fanny
to
the
river
you
must
like
him
said
julien
confidently
when
the
door
had
closed
fanny
said
she
would
and
you
like
him
fanny
said
she
did
i
met
him
so
many
years
ago
he
was
suffering
very
much
at
the
time
through
a
woman
now
he
will
tell
you
he
has
become
a
cynic
did
she
treat
him
badly
she
ran
away
from
him
taking
his
carriage
and
his
two
horses
a
beautiful
woman
interrupted
fanny
who
liked
details
she
might
equally
well
have
been
magnificent
or
monstrous
she
was
over
and
alfred
who
is
small
adored
her
everything
about
her
was
emphatic
her
hair
was
her
skin
too
red
and
never
still
never
in
one
place
alfred
had
a
house
outside
paris
and
carriage
and
horses
to
take
him
to
the
station
one
night
she
took
the
horses
put
them
into
the
carriage
and
was
seen
by
a
villager
seated
upon
the
coachman
box
driving
along
the
road
when
she
had
passed
him
this
man
saw
her
stop
and
take
up
a
dark
figure
who
climbed
to
the
seat
beside
her
they
the
woman
and
her
probable
lover
who
never
once
had
been
suspected
and
never
since
been
heard
of
drove
as
far
as
beaumont
near
here
where
they
had
an
accident
and
turned
the
carriage
into
the
ditch
killing
one
of
the
horses
the
other
they
took
out
and
coolly
tied
to
the
station
railings
they
took
the
train
and
disappeared
and
though
she
had
lived
with
alfred
two
years
she
never
left
a
note
for
him
to
tell
him
that
she
had
gone
she
never
wired
to
him
about
the
roses
she
never
has
written
one
since
enough
to
turn
him
into
a
cynic
not
at
first
he
came
to
me
spent
the
night
in
my
flat
he
was
distracted
we
must
have
walked
together
a
mile
across
my
little
floor
he
could
believe
she
was
gone
which
was
natural
and
though
next
morning
the
horses
were
missing
and
the
empty
he
be
got
to
connect
the
two
disappearances
he
rang
me
up
from
the
country
where
he
went
next
day
saying
earnestly
as
though
to
convince
himself
know
i
got
on
to
the
paris
police
about
those
horses
and
later
in
the
day
again
hear
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
all
over
the
country
then
when
the
horses
were
found
one
dead
and
the
other
tied
to
the
station
railings
he
believed
at
once
that
she
had
taken
them
and
would
talk
one
word
more
upon
the
subject
he
sold
the
remaining
horse
it
was
then
he
grew
cool
about
women
not
yet
it
was
then
that
he
met
almost
at
once
a
young
girl
who
insisted
in
the
most
amazing
fashion
that
she
loved
him
he
could
not
understand
it
he
came
to
me
and
said
does
she
love
me
i
thought
she
was
merely
intriguing
to
marry
him
but
no
he
said
something
sincere
and
impressive
in
her
tone
she
loves
me
what
shall
i
do
you
marry
her
i
said
and
then
he
was
all
at
once
taken
with
the
idea
to
such
a
degree
that
he
became
terrified
when
he
was
with
her
she
refuses
me
he
said
twenty
times
a
day
her
it
simple
staking
too
much
you
say
ask
her
when
all
in
a
minute
she
may
say
no
he
got
quite
ill
over
it
the
girl
mother
asked
him
to
the
house
the
girl
herself
though
she
saw
him
less
and
less
alone
smiled
at
him
as
tenderly
as
ever
and
then
there
came
a
day
when
he
left
me
full
of
courage
and
going
to
her
house
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
met
her
alone
by
chance
and
before
asking
her
mother
he
spoke
to
the
girl
herself
she
said
no
she
said
would
induce
her
to
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
did
stay
a
second
longer
in
the
house
he
did
even
come
to
me
but
went
back
into
the
country
and
then
to
england
but
why
did
the
girl
there
is
nothing
to
ask
or
at
any
rate
there
is
no
answer
to
anything
i
suppose
he
asked
himself
every
question
about
her
conduct
but
it
was
inexplicable
he
should
have
asked
her
twice
it
never
occurred
to
him
and
he
has
told
me
lately
that
she
refused
him
with
such
considered
firmness
that
it
seemed
unlikely
that
it
was
a
whim
well
poor
alfred
and
yet
it
was
only
the
merest
chance
the
merest
run
of
bad
luck
but
it
leaves
him
you
say
with
the
impression
that
we
are
flawed
a
terrible
flaw
his
opinion
is
that
there
is
a
deep
coldness
in
women
in
the
brain
too
he
feels
them
mortally
unsound
mad
and
cold
he
says
now
of
all
women
and
therefore
as
unlike
a
normal
man
as
a
creature
he
thinks
that
of
all
women
young
or
old
yes
i
think
so
he
tells
me
that
whereas
most
men
make
the
mistake
of
putting
down
womanly
unreason
to
the
score
of
their
having
too
much
heart
he
puts
it
down
to
their
having
no
heart
at
all
which
he
says
is
so
mad
a
state
that
they
are
unrecognisable
as
human
creatures
but
alas
poor
alfred
you
have
made
a
charming
confidante
for
us
confidante
he
will
make
the
best
he
is
devoted
to
me
to
me
to
anything
to
any
one
i
care
for
not
to
me
what
you
have
told
me
is
the
key
to
his
expression
when
he
looks
at
me
if
he
is
devoted
to
you
it
is
not
an
unreasoning
devotion
and
he
is
judging
me
poisonous
to
you
as
he
has
himself
been
hurt
he
will
not
have
you
hurt
i
wish
he
had
never
come
i
wish
he
might
never
be
my
driver
to
the
river
and
your
friend
and
our
enemy
fanny
i
wish
it
i
am
unhappy
about
him
and
unhappiness
is
always
punished
while
we
were
in
metz
every
one
smiled
at
us
here
every
one
will
spy
us
out
scold
frown
punish
and
your
magic
luck
alfred
threatens
my
luck
she
said
then
with
another
look
are
you
angry
with
me
can
you
love
such
a
character
i
love
it
now
you
have
never
heard
me
when
i
scold
or
cry
or
am
sulky
never
but
if
i
make
the
experiment
i
could
make
a
hundred
experiments
but
i
make
none
of
them
we
can
not
know
what
may
bring
this
she
remembered
suddenly
with
all
her
heart
come
nearer
to
me
fanny
why
are
you
sitting
so
far
away
she
sat
down
nearer
to
him
she
put
all
her
fingers
tightly
round
his
wrist
i
am
not
always
sure
that
you
are
there
julien
that
you
exist
yet
i
am
substantial
enough
no
you
are
most
it
is
the
thought
of
parting
that
checks
my
earnestness
as
though
i
had
an
impulse
to
save
myself
it
is
the
thought
of
parting
that
turns
you
into
a
ghost
already
parted
with
that
sheds
a
light
of
unreality
over
you
when
i
am
distant
something
in
me
makes
ready
for
that
parting
flees
from
you
and
i
can
not
stay
it
steals
itself
and
i
can
not
break
through
it
i
have
known
you
so
short
a
time
i
have
had
nothing
but
pleasure
from
you
is
it
possible
that
i
can
escape
without
pain
is
it
no
no
no
she
laid
her
cheek
upon
his
hand
do
something
to
make
it
easier
must
it
be
that
when
you
go
you
go
completely
promise
me
at
least
that
it
will
be
gradual
that
you
will
try
to
see
me
when
you
have
taken
up
your
other
life
but
if
i
ca
if
you
are
ordered
back
to
metz
why
should
i
be
but
if
i
am
promise
me
that
you
will
try
if
it
is
only
an
artifice
beguile
me
with
it
i
will
believe
in
any
promise
you
do
need
to
ask
me
to
promise
you
know
you
do
need
to
make
me
promise
wherever
you
are
sent
i
will
try
to
come
do
you
hear
do
you
think
that
that
life
is
a
dragon
to
eat
me
up
that
it
will
be
such
bliss
to
me
that
i
shall
forget
you
completely
it
to
be
bliss
but
work
hard
work
and
competition
it
is
the
work
that
will
keep
me
to
paris
not
my
happiness
my
gaiety
my
content
with
other
faces
that
would
comfort
me
if
i
were
listener
and
you
the
speaker
but
fanny
fanny
i
never
met
any
one
with
such
joy
as
you
it
is
you
who
change
the
forest
and
the
inns
we
meet
in
make
the
journeys
a
miracle
do
show
me
another
face
we
have
been
in
love
without
a
cloud
without
scenes
without
tears
you
have
laughed
at
everything
do
change
do
show
me
someone
whom
i
do
know
that
sad
this
then
she
held
up
a
face
in
whose
eyes
and
smile
was
the
hasty
radiance
his
fervour
had
brought
her
and
at
sight
of
it
the
words
broke
from
him
are
you
happy
so
quickly
yes
yes
already
happy
because
i
speak
aloud
of
what
i
feel
what
a
doubting
heart
you
have
within
you
and
i
believe
you
only
pretend
to
distress
yourself
that
you
may
test
whether
i
am
sensitive
enough
to
show
the
reflection
of
it
come
well
am
i
right
partly
but
i
need
not
think
oh
i
am
glad
your
feeling
is
so
like
mine
and
mine
like
yours
i
will
let
the
parting
take
care
of
itself
yet
there
is
one
thing
about
which
i
can
not
tell
what
does
your
heart
do
in
absence
what
kind
of
man
are
you
when
there
is
no
one
but
alfred
who
will
say
her
what
kind
do
you
think
while
i
am
here
beside
you
you
can
not
even
imagine
how
dim
i
might
become
can
i
tell
can
you
assure
me
dim
she
might
become
to
him
but
dim
she
was
not
now
as
she
besought
him
with
eyes
that
showed
a
quick
and
eager
heart
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
full
of
enquiry
sure
of
its
answer
feigning
doubt
that
did
not
distress
her
and
i
to
you
and
i
to
you
he
said
speaking
in
her
ear
when
he
had
made
her
an
answer
dim
too
why
do
we
never
talk
of
your
inconstancy
we
must
discuss
it
inconstancy
that
word
had
not
occurred
to
me
it
was
forgetfulness
that
i
dreaded
i
shall
not
be
unforgetful
until
i
am
inconstant
julien
my
love
you
can
afford
to
tease
me
now
you
have
me
in
such
a
mood
in
such
a
mood
have
i
indeed
yet
you
will
forget
me
before
i
forget
you
you
tell
me
to
my
face
that
i
shall
change
she
asked
yes
and
since
you
are
bound
to
forget
me
i
insist
at
least
that
there
shall
be
a
reason
for
doing
so
i
would
rather
be
a
king
dethroned
than
allowed
to
lapse
like
a
poor
idiot
you
would
you
can
say
that
her
voice
rose
one
instant
fanny
even
when
my
teasing
is
out
of
taste
learn
to
distinguish
it
from
what
i
say
in
earnest
my
dear
my
dear
why
should
you
have
to
listen
to
the
matter
of
philosophy
and
experience
which
tells
me
all
creatures
forget
and
are
forgotten
no
i
wipe
out
you
will
not
vanish
the
door
opened
and
alfred
entered
the
room
the
car
is
ready
he
said
i
have
had
trouble
in
getting
here
fanny
turned
to
him
i
am
ready
she
said
it
is
dreadful
to
have
to
trouble
you
to
take
me
so
late
at
night
to
the
river
no
no
alfred
glowing
from
the
exercise
in
the
snowy
night
outside
was
inclined
to
be
more
friendly
or
at
least
less
sparing
of
his
words
here
are
some
letters
that
were
at
your
lodging
he
handed
three
to
julien
when
do
you
dine
with
me
again
julien
holding
the
letters
placed
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
i
can
not
tell
what
the
work
will
be
perhaps
little
as
the
snow
is
deep
it
is
snowing
again
outside
said
alfred
then
the
snow
will
lie
even
deeper
and
there
will
be
no
work
get
her
back
quickly
alfred
or
the
snow
will
lie
too
deep
for
you
i
will
send
you
a
note
fanny
that
is
quite
easy
is
it
easy
but
compromising
oh
surely
not
very
in
france
everything
is
compromising
mademoiselle
said
alfred
but
he
will
find
a
way
to
send
it
julien
had
urged
her
to
hurry
fearing
the
snow
now
he
said
you
are
going
as
though
it
distressed
him
i
must
yes
you
must
you
must
where
is
your
leather
coat
here
he
found
it
stay
i
must
read
this
before
you
go
it
is
my
demobilisation
paper
with
the
final
date
i
will
look
are
you
coming
called
alfred
from
the
end
of
the
passage
it
is
snowing
wildly
there
is
some
mistake
muttered
julien
his
eye
searching
the
large
unfolded
document
when
when
fanny
hanging
on
his
words
watched
him
one
moment
it
is
a
mistake
alfred
alfred
here
a
minute
look
he
said
when
alfred
had
the
room
he
handed
the
paper
to
him
and
drew
him
under
the
light
see
they
say
ah
wait
did
i
register
at
charleville
or
paris
at
charleville
as
an
agriculturist
i
remember
well
then
there
is
no
mistake
he
folded
up
the
paper
pinching
the
edges
of
the
folds
slowly
with
his
thumb
and
finger
nail
fanny
it
has
come
sooner
than
i
expected
she
could
say
nothing
but
fastened
her
gaze
upon
his
lips
much
much
sooner
and
there
is
no
evading
it
alfred
i
will
bring
her
in
a
minute
the
snow
is
coming
down
muttered
the
mahogany
god
grown
wooden
again
under
the
light
and
retreated
it
is
worse
for
me
it
has
been
done
by
my
own
stupidity
but
in
those
days
i
did
know
you
oh
if
you
are
thinking
of
breaking
it
to
me
only
tell
me
day
she
moved
up
close
to
him
not
no
no
he
said
almost
relieved
that
it
was
better
than
she
feared
in
five
days
in
five
days
oh
this
brings
it
before
me
i
have
no
wish
now
for
that
release
for
which
i
have
longed
fanny
it
is
only
a
change
not
a
parting
alfred
voice
called
sharply
from
without
you
must
come
mademoiselle
julien
bring
her
one
instant
she
is
coming
fanny
i
must
think
it
out
until
i
go
i
shall
have
time
we
will
get
you
sent
to
charleville
and
charleville
i
must
come
often
to
see
my
land
and
my
factory
how
often
often
i
must
how
often
once
a
week
at
last
perhaps
more
often
if
we
can
only
manage
that
julien
alfred
returned
and
stood
again
in
the
doorway
this
is
absurd
i
can
never
get
to
the
river
if
you
keep
her
go
go
i
will
arrange
you
will
have
a
note
from
me
hurry
she
was
in
the
car
now
the
door
was
shutting
on
her
yet
once
more
he
pulled
it
open
ah
oh
at
the
side
of
the
car
the
snow
whirling
round
his
head
julien
kissed
her
face
in
the
darkness
alfred
relentless
drove
the
car
onward
and
the
door
shutting
with
a
slam
left
him
standing
by
the
inn
chapter
xiv
the
river
the
indifferent
alfred
drove
his
unhappy
burden
towards
the
river
walled
in
by
the
rush
of
snowflakes
about
him
he
made
what
way
he
could
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
lamps
gave
no
light
for
the
flakes
had
built
a
shutter
across
the
glass
like
a
policeman
dark
lantern
the
flying
multitudes
in
the
air
turned
him
dizzy
he
could
not
tell
upon
which
side
of
the
road
he
drove
and
he
could
not
tell
what
he
would
do
when
the
wall
beyond
the
outskirts
of
chantilly
forsook
him
as
to
what
was
happening
below
him
what
ruts
ditches
pits
or
hillocks
he
was
navigating
he
had
no
idea
his
ship
was
afloat
upon
the
snow
sluggishly
rolling
and
heaving
as
it
met
with
soft
mysterious
obstacles
heaviness
and
gloom
sat
upon
the
velvet
seat
behind
him
the
white
wild
night
outside
was
playful
and
waggish
compared
with
the
black
dejection
behind
the
opaque
glass
windows
fanny
who
could
not
see
her
hand
move
in
the
darkness
saw
clearly
with
other
miserable
and
roving
eyes
the
road
that
lay
before
her
julien
do
forget
me
that
she
would
say
to
him
in
a
few
days
that
was
the
gate
the
black
portal
which
would
lead
her
into
the
road
that
she
would
say
with
entreaty
yet
no
painful
tones
of
hers
would
represent
enough
the
entreaty
of
her
heart
that
would
forget
the
she
thought
of
this
not
in
wilful
unreason
or
in
disbelief
of
his
promise
she
looked
at
this
parting
as
though
it
might
be
final
without
him
she
could
see
no
charm
ahead
and
yet
tough
leathery
heart
indestructible
spinner
she
knew
herself
to
be
no
sooner
should
the
dew
fall
from
this
enchanting
fabric
the
web
itself
be
torn
than
she
would
set
to
work
upon
the
flimsiest
of
materials
to
weave
another
and
with
such
weaving
comes
forgetfulness
she
thought
of
this
not
four
feet
away
another
mind
inscrutable
to
hers
was
violently
employed
upon
its
own
problem
in
this
wild
darkness
the
wall
of
chantilly
had
bid
him
go
on
alone
it
left
him
first
without
guide
second
without
shelter
he
drove
into
the
path
of
a
rough
and
bitter
storm
which
was
attacking
everything
in
the
short
plain
between
the
forest
and
the
town
it
leapt
upon
him
in
an
outbreak
of
hisses
cut
him
with
hailstones
swept
up
false
banks
of
snow
before
him
till
the
illusion
of
a
road
led
him
astray
he
turned
too
much
to
the
right
hung
on
the
lip
of
a
buried
ditch
turned
back
again
and
saved
himself
he
turned
too
much
to
the
left
tilted
hung
was
in
danger
yet
found
the
centre
of
the
road
again
here
on
this
wild
plain
the
exposed
night
was
whiter
blanched
enough
foreign
enough
fitful
enough
to
puzzle
the
most
resolved
and
native
traveller
he
arrived
at
a
yet
was
it
a
when
roads
are
filled
in
level
with
the
plain
around
them
the
plain
itself
like
a
ploughed
field
when
banks
are
rompishly
erected
or
melt
unstably
before
the
blows
of
the
storm
it
is
hard
to
choose
the
true
road
from
the
false
he
chose
a
road
which
instantly
he
saw
to
be
no
road
too
late
he
pitched
this
time
not
to
recover
a
river
a
was
his
horrified
thought
down
went
the
nose
of
the
car
before
him
the
hitting
him
in
the
chest
down
came
fanny
and
all
her
black
thoughts
against
the
glass
at
his
back
the
car
had
not
fallen
very
far
it
had
slid
forward
into
a
dyke
and
remained
resting
on
its
radiator
its
front
wheels
thrust
into
the
steep
walls
of
the
bank
its
back
wheels
in
the
air
alfred
climbed
down
from
a
seat
which
had
lost
its
seating
power
fanny
opened
the
door
and
stepped
from
the
black
interior
into
the
deep
snow
the
front
lamps
were
extinguished
and
buried
in
the
opposite
bank
the
little
red
light
at
the
back
shone
upwards
to
heaven
well
well
are
you
hurt
not
at
all
and
you
not
a
bit
their
cold
relations
did
not
seem
one
whit
changed
from
what
they
had
been
in
the
inn
nothing
had
intervened
but
a
little
reflection
a
little
effort
and
a
vigorous
jerk
why
should
they
change
they
stood
side
by
side
in
the
noisy
violence
of
the
storm
and
one
shouted
to
the
other
can
you
get
her
out
and
the
other
answered
no
i
will
walk
on
to
the
river
you
would
never
find
it
the
truth
of
this
she
saw
as
she
looked
round
alfred
left
her
and
descending
into
the
dyke
went
on
his
knees
by
the
radiator
and
fumbled
deep
in
the
snow
with
his
hand
a
hissing
arose
as
the
heated
water
ran
from
the
tap
he
had
turned
he
emptied
the
water
from
the
generator
the
tail
light
sank
and
went
out
no
one
will
run
into
her
he
remarked
no
one
will
pass
aie
screamed
the
wind
and
created
a
pillar
of
white
powder
fanny
losing
her
balance
one
foot
sank
on
the
edge
of
a
rut
and
she
went
down
on
her
hands
to
the
knees
her
legs
met
the
cold
bite
of
the
snow
you
must
come
back
with
me
shouted
alfred
in
her
ear
that
seemed
true
and
necessary
she
could
not
reach
the
river
she
could
not
stay
where
she
was
she
followed
him
at
the
next
ditch
he
put
out
his
hand
and
helped
her
across
they
had
no
lamp
by
the
light
of
the
snow
she
watched
his
legs
as
they
sank
and
rose
her
own
sinking
and
rising
in
the
holes
he
left
for
her
the
buffets
of
wind
her
at
every
step
she
followed
him
and
because
she
was
as
green
as
a
green
bough
which
bursts
into
leaf
around
a
wound
the
disturbing
the
exciting
menace
of
her
discovery
brightened
her
heart
set
her
mind
whirling
and
overgrew
her
dejection
they
gained
the
chantilly
wall
and
experienced
at
once
its
protection
the
howling
wind
passed
overhead
and
left
them
in
a
lew
the
dancing
snowflakes
steadied
and
dropped
more
like
rain
upon
them
she
moved
up
abreast
of
alfred
i
will
take
you
back
to
the
inn
he
said
they
will
have
a
room
there
julien
will
have
left
and
gone
to
his
lodging
yes
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
answered
alfred
she
fancied
with
grim
satisfaction
though
it
is
as
well
she
thought
there
will
be
less
scandal
in
the
eyes
of
the
innkeeper
morning
mademoiselle
i
will
fetch
you
at
six
with
another
car
and
its
driver
foss
a
man
whom
i
can
trust
we
will
take
you
to
the
river
and
on
the
return
journey
drag
the
car
from
the
ditch
it
should
be
easy
she
has
not
heeled
over
on
her
side
that
will
be
marvellous
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
apologise
this
she
began
to
see
was
serious
her
debt
to
the
enemy
alfred
was
growing
hourly
no
no
he
said
as
though
he
saw
the
thing
in
the
light
of
common
justice
you
have
come
over
to
dine
with
julien
we
must
get
you
back
to
the
river
nevertheless
it
monstrous
she
thought
what
he
has
to
do
for
me
but
alfred
regarded
it
less
as
a
friendly
office
towards
julien
than
as
a
duty
an
order
given
by
an
officer
he
was
a
sergeant
and
four
years
of
war
had
changed
him
from
an
irritable
and
independent
friend
to
a
dogged
and
careful
subordinate
he
did
not
like
fanny
any
the
more
for
the
trouble
she
was
giving
him
but
he
did
not
hold
her
responsible
for
his
discomforts
she
must
be
got
to
the
river
and
to
the
river
he
would
get
her
pray
heaven
she
never
crossed
it
again
when
they
arrived
on
the
pavement
outside
the
inn
he
said
knock
mademoiselle
and
ask
if
there
is
a
room
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
not
be
seen
explain
that
the
snow
prevented
you
from
returning
if
there
is
a
room
do
not
come
back
to
tell
me
i
shall
watch
you
enter
and
fetch
you
at
six
in
the
morning
she
thanked
him
again
and
following
his
instructions
found
herself
presently
in
a
small
room
under
the
eaves
pitied
by
the
wife
given
a
hot
brick
wrapped
in
flannel
by
the
innkeeper
daughter
warmed
and
cheered
and
in
a
very
short
time
asleep
at
five
she
was
called
dressed
herself
and
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
paying
a
fabulous
bill
which
included
two
francs
for
the
hot
brick
at
six
came
alfred
in
another
car
seated
beside
foss
the
new
driver
a
pale
man
with
a
grave
face
they
moved
off
in
the
grey
dawn
which
brightened
as
they
drove
beyond
the
chantilly
wall
the
plain
stretched
and
on
it
the
labouring
of
the
night
before
were
plainly
marked
alfred
beside
the
driver
let
down
a
pane
of
glass
to
tell
her
that
he
had
already
been
out
with
foss
and
towed
in
the
other
car
she
saw
the
ditch
into
which
they
had
sunk
the
scrambled
marks
upon
the
bank
where
she
had
been
towed
out
in
ten
minutes
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
now
fate
the
bully
punishing
the
unlucky
tripping
up
the
hurried
stepped
in
again
this
car
which
had
been
seized
in
a
hurry
by
cold
and
yawning
men
was
not
as
she
should
be
is
she
oiled
foss
had
called
to
the
real
driver
of
the
car
she
is
everything
answered
the
man
in
a
hurry
going
off
to
his
coffee
she
was
not
just
as
the
approaching
sun
began
to
clear
the
air
just
as
with
a
spring
at
her
heart
fanny
felt
that
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
a
fine
day
was
worth
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
the
engine
began
to
knock
she
saw
foss
head
tilt
a
little
sideways
like
a
keen
dog
who
is
listening
the
knock
increased
the
engine
laboured
a
grinding
set
in
foss
pulled
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
muttered
to
alfred
he
opened
the
bonnet
stared
a
second
then
tried
the
starting
handle
it
would
not
move
fanny
let
down
the
pane
of
glass
and
watched
them
in
silence
not
a
drop
said
foss
low
voice
and
later
oil
yes
but
find
me
the
tin
do
you
mean
there
is
no
oil
no
spare
oil
alfred
hunted
vainly
round
the
car
under
the
seats
in
the
tool
box
there
was
no
tin
of
oil
if
i
had
some
oil
said
foss
and
if
i
let
her
cool
a
little
i
could
manage
with
a
syringe
they
consulted
together
alfred
nodded
and
approached
the
window
mademoiselle
he
said
i
am
going
on
to
the
next
village
to
get
a
tin
of
oil
there
is
a
garage
cars
will
be
passing
soon
i
must
ask
you
to
lie
covered
with
the
rug
in
the
bottom
of
the
car
your
uniform
is
very
visible
foss
will
remain
with
you
fanny
lay
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
car
fitting
her
legs
among
a
couple
of
empty
petrol
tins
foss
covered
her
with
the
rug
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
and
above
her
she
began
to
hear
the
voices
of
birds
below
her
the
cold
crept
up
she
had
no
idea
how
far
the
village
might
be
and
it
is
possible
that
alfred
had
had
no
idea
either
a
bicycle
bell
rang
at
her
side
later
she
heard
the
noise
of
a
car
which
passed
her
with
a
rush
lying
with
her
ear
so
close
to
the
poor
body
of
the
motor
she
felt
it
to
be
but
cold
bones
in
a
cemetery
dead
dead
outside
in
the
road
foss
shaded
his
eyes
and
looked
up
the
now
sparkling
road
a
hundred
times
the
motors
increased
the
morning
traffic
between
précy
and
chantilly
awoke
the
cars
were
going
in
to
the
offices
of
the
now
and
then
foss
would
come
to
the
window
of
the
car
move
he
would
say
the
were
rattled
by
an
icy
wind
that
blew
over
the
face
of
the
snow
and
up
under
the
car
the
brown
silk
legs
lay
prone
and
stiff
between
the
petrol
cans
lifeless
now
to
the
knee
she
was
seized
with
fits
of
violent
shivering
at
one
moment
she
had
planned
in
her
despair
to
call
to
foss
and
tell
him
she
would
walk
but
she
had
let
the
moment
pass
and
now
she
put
away
the
thought
of
walking
on
those
lifeless
feet
besides
she
would
be
seen
that
cap
bobbing
back
between
the
trees
from
chantilly
so
early
in
the
morning
oh
honour
of
the
section
i
am
guarding
you
like
my
life
she
tried
to
raise
her
head
a
little
to
ease
her
neck
do
move
said
foss
feet
pattered
past
her
motors
swept
by
bicycle
bells
rang
foss
she
said
the
soldier
leant
towards
her
and
listened
choose
your
own
time
but
you
must
let
me
sit
up
a
moment
i
am
in
pain
then
now
mademoiselle
she
sat
up
flinging
the
rug
back
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
the
forest
the
climbing
sun
the
trees
behind
her
was
a
cart
coming
up
slowly
far
ahead
a
cyclist
swayed
in
the
ruts
of
the
road
as
they
approached
her
she
pleaded
they
ca
know
me
let
me
sit
up
but
foss
knew
only
one
master
his
sergeant
better
go
down
mademoiselle
she
went
down
again
under
the
black
rug
close
against
the
wind
that
lifted
the
wrapping
her
coat
more
tightly
round
her
folding
her
arms
about
her
knees
it
must
be
nearly
eight
i
have
an
hour
more
before
they
come
in
to
breakfast
ah
and
when
they
do
will
one
of
them
go
into
my
bedroom
with
my
letters
she
tried
to
pick
out
in
her
mind
that
one
most
friendly
to
her
that
one
who
was
to
destroy
her
she
heard
in
spirit
her
cry
fanny
there
she
thought
of
stewart
who
would
have
woken
early
planning
anxiously
to
save
her
the
faces
of
the
guardians
of
the
honour
of
the
section
began
to
visit
her
one
by
one
and
horror
spread
in
her
then
pushing
them
from
her
attempting
to
escape
they
are
not
all
the
world
but
they
all
the
world
if
in
a
strange
land
they
were
all
to
frown
together
the
thought
was
horrible
time
to
get
there
yet
alas
that
the
car
was
not
facing
chantilly
so
early
in
the
morning
foss
foss
do
you
see
him
coming
the
road
is
full
of
people
a
car
rushed
by
them
yet
never
seemed
to
pass
the
engine
slowed
down
and
a
voice
called
what
up
anything
you
want
it
was
the
voice
of
roland
vauclin
ah
she
knew
him
that
fat
childish
man
who
loved
gossip
as
he
loved
his
food
to
fanny
it
seemed
but
a
question
of
seconds
before
he
would
lift
the
rug
say
gravely
good
morning
mademoiselle
before
he
would
rush
back
to
his
village
spreading
the
news
like
a
fall
of
fresh
snow
over
the
roofs
she
lay
still
from
sheer
inertia
had
foss
answered
she
could
not
hear
then
she
heard
him
clear
his
throat
and
speak
the
captain
asked
me
to
get
a
bit
of
wood
for
his
fire
sir
i
have
a
man
in
there
gathering
branches
while
i
do
a
bit
of
with
the
car
oh
right
go
on
said
vauclin
to
his
own
chauffeur
again
they
were
left
alone
talk
between
them
was
almost
impossible
fanny
was
so
muffled
foss
so
anxiously
watched
for
alfred
the
reedy
singing
between
the
boards
where
the
wind
attacked
her
occupied
all
her
attention
the
very
core
of
warmth
seemed
extinguished
in
her
body
never
to
be
lit
again
she
remembered
their
last
or
special
who
had
gone
on
leave
upon
an
open
truck
and
who
had
grown
colder
and
colder
and
he
never
got
warm
again
and
he
died
madame
the
letter
from
his
wife
had
told
them
i
think
he
is
coming
there
is
no
one
else
on
the
road
mademoiselle
will
you
look
i
do
see
very
well
she
tried
to
throw
off
the
rug
and
sit
up
but
her
frozen
elbow
slipped
and
she
fell
again
on
the
floor
of
the
car
pulling
herself
up
she
stared
with
him
through
the
glass
far
up
the
white
road
a
little
figure
toiled
towards
them
carrying
something
wavering
as
though
the
were
deep
picking
its
way
from
side
to
side
neither
of
them
was
sure
whether
it
was
alfred
they
watched
in
silence
before
she
knew
it
was
upon
her
a
car
went
by
she
dived
beneath
the
rug
striking
her
forehead
on
the
corner
of
the
folding
seat
did
they
see
was
any
one
inside
it
was
an
empty
car
please
be
careful
foss
was
cold
with
rebuke
after
that
she
lay
still
isolated
even
from
foss
ten
minutes
went
by
and
suddenly
foss
spoke
did
you
have
to
go
far
and
alfred
hard
voice
answered
yes
then
she
heard
the
two
men
working
tools
clattering
murmured
voices
and
in
ten
minutes
foss
said
try
the
starting
handle
she
heard
the
efforts
the
labour
of
alfred
at
the
handle
he
will
kill
himself
he
will
break
a
she
thought
as
she
listened
to
him
every
few
minutes
someone
seized
the
handle
and
wound
and
wound
as
she
had
never
wound
in
her
life
on
and
on
past
the
very
limit
of
endurance
and
under
her
ear
in
the
cold
bones
of
the
car
not
a
sign
of
life
not
a
sign
of
life
and
as
though
she
could
hear
them
all
the
clocks
in
the
world
struck
nine
the
guardians
of
the
honour
would
be
in
at
breakfast
now
they
would
be
sitting
sitting
discussing
her
absence
stewart
upstairs
would
be
looking
out
of
the
window
watching
the
river
perhaps
answering
questions
indifferently
with
her
cool
look
oh
in
the
garage
or
walking
in
the
forest
i
do
know
cough
she
jumped
as
the
bones
in
the
bottom
of
the
car
moved
under
her
and
the
engine
breathed
the
noise
died
out
foss
leapt
to
the
handle
and
wound
and
wound
fiercely
like
a
man
who
meant
to
make
her
breathe
again
or
die
again
she
struggled
to
life
lived
for
a
few
minutes
choked
and
was
silent
how
is
the
handle
pretty
stiff
said
foss
but
getting
better
give
me
the
oil
squirt
alfred
took
his
place
at
the
handle
suddenly
the
car
sprang
to
life
again
on
a
full
deep
note
fanny
lifted
her
head
a
little
foss
was
leaning
over
the
carburettor
with
his
thin
anxious
look
alfred
stood
in
the
snow
dark
red
in
the
face
and
covered
with
oil
soon
they
were
moving
along
the
road
slowly
at
first
and
with
difficulty
then
faster
and
more
freely
a
little
thin
warmth
began
to
creep
up
through
the
boards
and
play
about
her
legs
she
was
carried
along
under
her
dark
rug
for
another
twenty
minutes
then
fell
against
the
seat
as
the
car
turned
sharply
into
the
forsaken
road
that
led
to
the
broken
bridge
in
five
minutes
more
the
car
had
stopped
and
alfred
was
at
the
door
saying
at
last
mademoiselle
she
stammered
her
thanks
as
she
tried
to
step
from
the
car
to
the
ground
but
fell
on
her
knees
on
the
dashboard
have
you
hurt
your
foot
said
alfred
who
was
hot
i
am
only
cold
she
said
humbly
unwilling
to
intrude
her
puny
endurances
on
their
gigantic
labours
she
sat
on
the
step
of
the
car
rubbing
her
ankles
and
stared
at
the
meadows
of
thawing
snow
at
the
open
porches
of
stone
which
led
the
road
straight
into
the
river
at
the
church
and
the
sunlit
houses
on
the
other
side
bidding
them
she
reached
the
bank
and
climbed
down
it
stumbling
in
the
frozen
mud
and
pits
of
ice
till
she
reached
the
stiff
reeds
at
the
bank
the
river
had
floes
of
ice
upon
it
green
ice
which
swung
and
caught
among
the
reeds
at
the
edge
it
is
thin
she
thought
pushing
her
shoe
through
it
it
ca
prevent
the
boat
from
crossing
the
river
yet
she
was
anxious
there
on
the
other
side
was
the
little
hut
the
steps
the
boat
tied
to
the
stone
and
held
rigid
in
the
ice
a
shaggy
dog
ran
by
her
feet
to
the
river
edge
and
barked
feet
came
clambering
down
the
bank
and
a
workman
followed
the
dog
with
a
bag
of
tools
and
a
basket
he
walked
up
to
the
river
and
putting
his
hands
in
a
trumpet
to
his
mouth
called
in
a
huge
voice
un
passant
margot
margot
fanny
remembered
her
whistle
and
blew
that
too
there
was
no
sign
of
life
and
the
little
hut
looked
as
before
like
a
brown
dog
asleep
in
the
sun
fanny
turned
to
the
man
ready
to
share
her
anxiety
with
him
but
he
had
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
was
retying
a
bootlace
that
had
come
undone
margot
never
showed
herself
at
the
hut
window
at
the
hut
door
when
fanny
turned
back
to
whistle
again
she
saw
her
standing
up
in
the
boat
which
freed
was
drifting
out
towards
them
saw
her
scatter
the
ice
with
her
oar
and
the
boat
pushed
upstream
came
drifting
down
towards
them
in
a
curve
to
hit
the
bank
at
their
feet
the
girl
stepped
out
smiling
happy
pretty
undimmed
by
the
habit
of
trade
the
man
got
in
and
sat
down
the
dog
beside
him
i
would
stand
said
margot
to
fanny
it
so
wet
she
made
no
allusion
to
the
broken
appointment
for
the
night
before
fanny
noticing
the
dripping
boards
of
the
boat
stood
up
her
hand
upon
margot
shoulder
to
steady
herself
the
thin
illusory
ice
shivered
and
broke
and
sank
as
the
oar
dipped
in
sideways
cocks
were
crowing
on
the
other
side
the
sun
drew
faint
colours
from
the
ice
the
river
clattered
at
the
side
of
the
boat
wind
twisted
and
shook
her
skirt
and
stirred
her
hair
all
was
forgotten
in
the
glory
of
the
passage
of
the
river
margot
smiling
up
under
her
damp
brown
hair
took
her
five
sous
pressed
her
town
boots
against
the
wooden
bar
and
shot
the
boat
up
against
the
bank
fanny
went
up
the
bank
over
the
railway
lines
and
out
into
the
road
two
hundred
yards
of
road
lay
before
her
leading
straight
up
to
the
house
on
the
left
was
a
high
wall
on
the
right
the
common
covered
with
snow
should
some
one
come
out
of
the
house
there
was
no
chance
of
hiding
she
glanced
down
at
her
silk
stockings
yet
she
could
not
hurry
on
those
stiff
and
painful
feet
she
was
near
the
door
in
the
wall
she
passed
in
the
dog
did
not
bark
came
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
nobody
looked
out
of
the
window
walked
into
the
hall
among
their
hanging
coats
and
macintoshes
touched
them
moved
them
with
her
shoulder
heard
voices
behind
the
door
of
the
breakfast
room
was
on
the
stairs
up
out
of
sight
past
the
first
bend
up
up
into
stewart
room
you
one
oh
oh
all
her
high
nerves
came
scudding
and
shuddering
down
into
the
meadows
of
content
eternal
luck
she
crept
under
eiderdown
and
shivered
here
the
chocolate
i
will
boil
it
again
on
my
cooker
oh
you
have
a
sort
of
ague
good
friend
kind
friend
she
had
pictured
her
like
that
anxious
unquestioning
and
warm
later
she
went
downstairs
and
opened
the
door
of
the
breakfast
room
upon
the
guardians
of
the
honour
as
she
stood
looking
at
them
she
felt
that
her
clothes
were
the
clothes
of
some
one
who
had
spent
hours
in
the
forest
that
her
eyes
gave
out
a
gay
picture
of
all
that
was
behind
them
her
adventures
must
shout
aloud
from
her
hands
her
feet
had
your
breakfast
said
some
one
upstairs
said
fanny
contentedly
and
marvelled
she
had
only
to
open
and
close
her
lips
a
dozen
times
bid
them
form
the
words
i
have
been
out
all
night
to
turn
those
browsing
herds
of
benevolence
into
an
ambush
of
threatening
horns
lowered
at
her
almost
she
would
to
have
said
the
sentence
but
basking
in
their
want
of
knowledge
she
sat
down
and
ate
her
third
breakfast
chapter
xv
allies
a
thaw
set
in
all
night
the
snow
hurried
from
the
branches
slid
down
the
tree
trunks
sank
into
the
ground
sank
into
the
moss
which
suddenly
uncovered
breathed
water
as
a
sponge
breathes
beneath
the
sea
sank
into
the
oise
which
set
up
a
roaring
as
the
rising
water
sapped
and
tunnelled
under
its
banks
with
a
noise
of
thunder
the
winter
roof
of
the
villa
slipped
down
and
fell
into
the
garden
leaving
the
handiwork
of
man
exposed
to
the
dawn
streaming
tiles
ornamental
chimneys
unburied
gargoyles
parapet
and
towers
of
wood
in
a
still
earlier
hour
while
darkness
yet
concealed
the
change
of
aspect
fanny
left
the
garden
with
a
lantern
in
her
hand
she
had
a
paper
in
her
pocket
and
on
the
paper
was
written
the
order
of
her
mission
the
order
ran
clearly
to
take
one
officer
to
the
demobolisation
centre
at
amiens
and
proceed
to
charleville
but
the
familiar
words
and
return
were
not
upon
it
she
cast
no
glance
back
yet
in
her
mind
sent
no
glance
forward
she
could
not
think
of
what
she
left
she
left
nothing
since
these
romantic
forests
would
be
as
empty
as
tunnels
when
julien
was
not
there
but
closing
the
door
of
the
garden
gate
softly
behind
her
she
blew
out
the
lantern
and
hung
it
to
the
topmost
spike
that
stewart
who
was
leaving
for
england
in
the
morning
might
bequeath
it
to
their
landlady
all
night
long
the
renault
had
stood
ready
packed
in
the
road
by
the
villa
and
now
starting
the
engine
which
ran
soundlessly
beneath
the
bonnet
she
drove
from
a
village
whose
strangeness
was
hidden
from
her
followed
the
oise
which
rumbled
on
a
new
note
heard
the
bubbling
of
wild
brooks
through
the
trees
and
was
lost
in
the
steamy
moisture
of
a
thawing
forest
there
was
a
sad
a
deadly
charm
still
about
the
journey
there
was
a
bitter
and
a
sweet
comfort
yet
before
her
there
were
two
hours
of
farewell
to
be
said
at
dawn
there
was
the
sight
of
his
face
once
more
for
her
that
the
man
who
slipped
into
the
seat
beside
her
at
chantilly
was
julien
dissolved
her
courage
and
set
her
heart
beating
she
glanced
at
him
in
that
early
light
and
he
at
her
two
hours
before
them
still
she
was
to
carry
him
with
her
only
to
lose
him
surely
he
was
to
accompany
her
on
her
journey
only
to
turn
back
all
the
way
to
amiens
he
reassured
himself
and
her
in
a
week
i
will
come
to
charleville
and
she
replied
yes
this
is
nothing
i
lose
you
here
but
in
a
week
you
will
come
why
then
this
dread
in
a
week
in
a
week
ran
the
refrain
how
will
you
find
me
at
charleville
will
you
come
to
the
garage
no
i
shall
write
to
the
lion
you
will
find
in
the
middle
of
the
main
street
an
old
inn
with
mouldering
black
wood
upon
the
window
sashes
how
well
i
know
it
i
will
write
there
we
are
so
near
the
end
she
said
suddenly
that
to
have
said
to
you
to
leave
you
at
amiens
is
no
worse
than
this
and
faster
she
hurried
towards
amiens
to
find
relief
he
did
not
contradict
her
or
bid
her
go
slower
but
as
they
neared
amiens
offered
once
more
his
promise
that
they
would
meet
again
in
a
week
it
is
that
she
said
i
know
we
shall
meet
again
it
is
that
i
fear
never
to
see
you
again
it
is
the
closing
of
a
chapter
i
too
know
that
they
drove
into
amiens
in
the
streaming
daylight
the
rain
poured
i
am
sending
you
to
my
home
he
said
every
inch
of
the
country
is
mine
you
go
to
a
town
that
i
know
villages
that
i
know
roads
that
i
have
walked
and
ridden
and
driven
upon
you
go
to
my
country
i
like
to
think
of
that
i
shall
go
at
once
to
see
your
house
in
revins
yes
oh
you
will
see
it
easily
on
the
banks
of
the
meuse
i
was
born
there
in
a
week
in
a
few
days
in
a
short
time
i
will
come
too
she
stopped
the
car
in
a
side
street
of
the
town
lifting
her
hands
she
said
they
want
to
hold
you
back
then
placed
them
back
on
the
wheel
they
ca
she
said
and
shook
her
head
he
took
his
bag
in
his
hand
and
stood
by
the
car
looking
at
her
you
take
the
three
train
back
to
paris
when
the
papers
are
through
she
said
hurriedly
with
sudden
nervousness
and
then
oh
we
said
everything
oh
let
get
it
over
he
held
the
side
of
the
car
with
his
hand
then
stepped
back
sharply
she
drove
down
the
street
without
looking
back
there
was
a
sort
of
relief
in
turning
the
next
corner
in
knowing
that
if
she
looked
back
she
would
see
nothing
a
heavy
shadow
lifted
from
her
it
was
a
deliverance
was
said
was
over
that
pain
was
done
now
for
the
next
now
for
the
first
of
the
days
without
him
she
had
slipped
over
the
portal
of
one
sorrow
to
arrive
at
another
but
she
felt
the
change
and
her
misery
lightened
this
lasted
her
all
the
morning
she
moved
out
of
amiens
upon
the
quentin
road
and
was
almost
beyond
the
town
before
she
thought
of
buying
food
for
the
day
unjustly
violently
she
reflected
what
a
hurry
to
leave
me
he
did
not
ask
if
i
had
food
or
petrol
or
a
map
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
it
was
because
he
was
young
and
in
trouble
and
had
left
her
quickly
blindly
as
eager
as
she
to
loosen
that
violent
pain
she
bought
a
loaf
of
bread
a
tin
of
potted
meat
an
orange
and
a
small
cheese
and
drove
on
upon
the
road
until
she
came
to
warfusée
wherever
her
thoughts
fell
wherever
her
eye
lay
his
personality
gnawed
within
her
and
nowhere
upon
her
horizon
could
she
find
anything
that
would
do
instead
julien
who
had
moved
off
down
the
street
in
amiens
went
moving
off
down
the
street
of
her
endless
thought
i
have
only
just
left
him
ca
i
go
back
and
this
cry
carried
out
in
the
nerves
of
her
foot
slowed
the
car
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
she
looked
back
no
smoke
darkened
the
landscape
amiens
was
gone
behind
her
again
on
in
ten
minutes
the
battlefields
closed
in
beside
the
road
julien
was
gone
stewart
was
gone
comfort
and
ease
and
plenty
were
gone
but
are
here
again
groaned
the
great
moors
ahead
and
on
each
hand
the
dun
grass
waved
to
the
very
edge
of
the
road
cut
through
it
deep
and
wild
stretched
the
battlefields
and
there
a
few
yards
ahead
were
those
poor
strangers
the
scavenging
chinamen
upon
a
large
rough
signpost
the
word
foucaucourt
was
painted
in
white
letters
a
village
of
spars
and
beams
and
broken
bricks
yet
here
as
everywhere
returning
civilians
hunted
like
crows
among
the
ruins
carrying
beams
and
rusty
stoves
and
large
umbrellas
for
the
rain
at
the
next
corner
a
scotch
officer
hailed
her
will
you
give
me
a
lift
he
sat
down
beside
her
what
do
you
do
she
asked
i
look
after
chinamen
ah
how
lonely
it
is
terrible
he
replied
look
at
it
dead
for
miles
the
army
gone
and
i
here
with
these
little
yellow
fellows
grubbing
up
the
crumbs
she
put
him
down
at
what
he
called
my
corner
a
piece
of
ground
indistinguishable
from
the
rest
is
that
where
you
live
yes
there
was
a
hut
from
whose
chimney
smoke
exuded
and
to
this
ran
a
track
across
the
grass
she
watched
him
walk
along
it
a
friendless
sandy
man
left
over
from
the
armies
which
had
peopled
the
rabbit
warren
in
the
ground
the
renault
loped
on
with
its
action
and
she
felt
a
spring
of
relief
that
she
lived
upon
moving
ground
passing
on
down
the
rickety
road
she
forgot
the
little
man
ahead
lay
the
terrible
miles
she
seemed
to
make
no
gain
upon
them
and
could
not
alter
the
face
of
the
horizon
however
fast
she
drove
iron
brown
grass
brown
grass
and
iron
spars
of
wood
girders
torn
railway
lines
and
stones
even
the
lorries
travelling
the
road
were
few
and
far
between
a
deep
loneliness
was
settled
upon
the
desert
where
nothing
grew
yet
suddenly
from
a
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
a
child
of
five
stared
at
her
it
had
its
foot
close
by
a
stacked
heap
of
hand
grenades
a
shawl
was
wrapped
round
it
and
the
thin
hands
held
the
ends
together
what
child
whose
how
did
it
get
here
when
not
a
house
stood
erect
for
miles
and
miles
when
not
a
coil
of
smoke
touched
the
horizon
yes
something
oozed
from
the
ground
smoke
blue
smoke
was
life
stirring
like
a
bulb
under
this
whiter
ruin
this
cemetery
of
village
bones
she
stopped
the
car
the
child
turned
and
ran
quickly
across
a
heap
of
dust
and
iron
and
down
into
the
ground
behind
a
pillar
it
must
have
a
father
or
mother
below
the
breath
of
the
invisible
hearth
coiled
up
into
the
air
the
child
was
gone
a
man
appeared
behind
the
pillar
and
came
towards
the
car
fanny
held
out
her
and
offered
it
to
him
have
you
been
here
long
she
asked
a
month
mademoiselle
are
there
many
of
you
in
this
village
not
a
spar
not
a
pile
of
bricks
stood
higher
than
two
feet
above
the
ground
there
are
ten
persons
now
a
family
came
in
yesterday
but
how
are
you
fed
a
lorry
passes
once
a
week
for
all
the
people
in
this
district
within
fifty
miles
there
are
ten
souls
in
one
village
twenty
in
another
two
in
another
they
have
promised
to
send
us
huts
but
the
huts
do
come
we
have
sunk
a
well
now
and
it
is
drinkable
but
before
that
we
got
water
by
lorry
once
a
week
and
we
often
begged
a
little
from
the
radiators
of
other
lorries
what
have
you
got
down
there
it
is
the
cellar
of
my
house
mademoiselle
there
are
two
rooms
still
and
one
is
watertight
the
trouble
is
the
lack
of
tools
i
ca
build
anything
we
have
a
spade
and
a
pick
and
a
hammer
which
we
keep
between
the
ten
of
us
take
my
hammer
said
fanny
i
can
get
another
in
the
garage
he
took
it
pleased
and
grateful
and
she
left
this
pioneer
of
recolonisation
this
obstinate
crusoe
and
his
family
standing
by
his
banner
of
blue
smoke
another
hour
and
a
large
signpost
arrested
her
attention
this
villers
carbonel
it
told
her
and
beneath
it
three
roads
ran
in
different
directions
there
was
no
sign
at
all
of
the
village
not
a
brick
lay
where
the
signpost
stood
stopping
the
car
she
drew
out
her
map
and
considered
and
suddenly
out
of
nowhere
with
a
rattle
and
a
bang
and
a
high
blast
on
a
mad
little
horn
a
ford
arrived
at
her
side
upon
the
got
no
gas
enquired
an
american
she
looked
up
into
his
pink
face
his
hood
was
broken
and
hung
down
over
one
side
of
the
car
one
of
his
springs
was
broken
and
he
appeared
to
be
holding
the
car
upright
by
the
tilt
of
his
body
his
tyres
were
in
rags
great
pieces
of
rubber
hung
out
beyond
the
mudguards
dandy
car
you
got
he
said
with
envy
french
soon
he
was
gone
upon
the
road
to
chaulnes
his
retreating
back
with
the
spindly
axle
the
wild
hood
the
torn
fragments
of
tyre
flying
round
in
streamers
and
the
painful
list
of
the
body
set
her
laughing
as
she
stood
by
the
signpost
in
the
desert
then
she
took
the
road
to
peronne
i
wo
have
my
lunch
yet
looking
at
the
pale
sun
her
only
watch
had
stopped
long
since
resenting
the
vibrations
of
the
wheel
she
passed
peronne
uprooted
railways
and
houses
falling
head
foremost
into
the
river
and
beyond
it
side
roads
led
her
to
a
small
deserted
village
oddly
untouched
by
shell
or
fire
here
the
doors
swung
and
banged
unlatched
by
any
human
fingers
the
windows
still
draped
with
curtains
were
shut
and
no
face
looked
out
here
she
ate
her
lunch
the
rain
had
ceased
and
a
little
pale
sunshine
cheered
the
cottages
the
henless
dogless
empty
road
a
valiant
bird
sang
on
a
hedge
beside
her
with
her
she
opened
the
tin
of
potted
meat
and
with
their
handle
spread
it
on
the
bread
lord
how
lonely
it
is
surely
some
door
might
open
some
face
look
out
at
that
a
little
gust
of
wind
got
up
and
she
jumped
in
her
seat
for
a
front
door
slammed
and
blew
back
again
i
could
stay
here
the
night
with
a
shiver
and
the
bird
on
the
branch
sang
louder
than
ever
it
all
very
well
she
addressed
him
you
with
your
own
civilisation
i
right
of
mine
the
day
wore
on
the
white
sun
having
finished
climbing
one
side
of
the
sky
came
down
upon
the
other
here
and
there
a
man
hailed
her
and
she
gave
him
a
lift
to
his
village
talked
a
little
to
him
and
set
him
down
a
young
belgian
who
had
learned
his
english
at
eton
was
her
companion
for
half
an
hour
and
you
are
with
the
french
he
asked
how
do
you
like
the
fellows
i
like
them
very
much
i
like
them
enormously
strange
question
when
all
france
meant
julien
do
you
find
they
think
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
world
he
grumbled
it
is
a
delicious
theory
for
them
and
it
must
be
amusing
to
be
french
little
belgium
jealous
young
sister
resentful
of
the
charm
of
the
elder
woman
of
the
world
a
french
lieutenant
climbed
to
the
seat
beside
her
you
are
english
mademoiselle
he
said
she
thought
with
a
touch
of
severity
he
was
silent
for
a
while
then
ah
none
but
the
english
could
do
this
what
drive
as
you
do
alone
mademoiselle
amid
such
perils
she
did
not
ask
to
what
perils
he
alluded
and
she
knew
that
his
words
were
a
condemnation
not
a
compliment
ah
she
knew
that
story
that
theory
that
implication
of
coldness
she
did
not
trouble
to
reply
nor
would
she
have
known
how
had
she
wished
it
they
passed
an
inhabited
village
from
a
door
flew
a
man
in
a
green
bonnet
and
staggered
in
the
street
after
him
a
huge
peasant
woman
came
and
standing
in
the
doorway
shook
her
fist
at
him
i
teach
you
to
meddle
with
my
daughter
those
are
the
cursed
italians
said
the
french
lieutenant
leaning
from
the
car
to
watch
a
mile
further
on
they
came
to
a
quarry
in
which
men
prowled
in
rags
those
are
the
russians
he
said
and
these
were
kept
behind
barbed
wire
fenced
round
with
armed
sentries
she
remembered
an
incident
in
paris
when
she
had
hailed
a
taxi
are
you
an
american
asked
the
driver
for
you
know
i
do
much
like
driving
americans
but
i
am
english
well
that
better
i
was
on
the
english
front
once
driving
for
the
french
mission
why
do
you
like
americans
among
other
things
they
give
me
two
francs
when
three
is
marked
but
once
they
gave
you
ten
where
three
was
marked
that
all
changed
laughed
the
and
it
a
long
story
i
do
like
them
go
away
said
france
restlessly
pushing
at
the
new
nations
in
her
bosom
it
all
done
go
back
again
are
you
an
ally
said
the
allies
to
each
other
balefully
their
eyes
no
longer
lit
by
battle
but
irritable
with
disillusion
and
each
told
his
women
tales
of
the
other
shortcomings
along
the
sides
of
the
roads
in
the
gutters
picking
the
of
the
battlefields
there
were
representatives
of
other
nations
who
did
not
join
in
the
of
the
lords
of
the
earth
chinese
arabs
and
annamites
made
signs
and
gibbered
but
none
cared
whether
they
were
in
amity
or
enmity
only
up
in
germany
was
there
any
peace
from
acrimony
the
allies
walked
contentedly
about
fed
well
looked
kindly
at
each
other
were
no
epithets
to
fling
they
had
all
been
flung
long
ago
and
the
german
people
looking
curiously
back
begged
buttons
as
souvenirs
from
the
uniforms
of
the
men
who
spoke
so
many
different
languages
chapter
xvi
the
ardennes
the
day
wore
on
the
sun
came
lower
and
nearer
till
the
ran
with
her
thought
dropping
sinking
dying
guise
said
the
signpost
and
a
battlement
stared
down
and
threw
its
shadow
across
her
face
is
that
where
the
dukes
lived
she
was
a
speck
in
the
landscape
moving
on
wheels
that
were
none
of
her
invention
covering
distances
of
hundreds
of
miles
without
amazement
upon
a
magic
mount
unknown
to
her
forefathers
dark
and
light
moved
across
the
face
of
the
falling
day
sometimes
when
she
lifted
her
eyes
great
clouds
full
of
rain
were
crossing
the
sky
and
now
when
she
looked
again
the
wind
had
torn
them
to
shreds
and
hunted
them
away
the
shadows
lengthened
those
of
the
few
trees
falling
in
bars
across
the
road
a
turn
of
the
road
brought
the
setting
sun
in
her
face
and
blinded
with
light
she
drove
into
it
when
it
had
gone
it
left
rays
enough
behind
to
colour
everything
gilding
the
road
itself
the
air
the
mists
that
hung
in
the
ditches
before
the
light
was
gone
she
saw
the
ardennes
forests
begin
upon
her
left
when
it
was
gone
wood
and
road
air
and
earth
were
alike
then
the
definite
night
creeping
forward
on
all
sides
painted
out
all
but
the
road
and
the
margin
of
the
road
and
with
the
side
lights
on
all
vision
narrowed
down
to
the
grey
snout
of
the
bonnet
the
two
hooped
mudguards
stretched
like
divers
arms
and
the
blanched
dead
leaves
which
floated
above
from
the
unseen
branches
of
the
trees
four
crazy
fords
were
drawn
up
in
one
village
street
and
as
her
lights
flashed
on
the
door
she
caught
sight
of
the
word
café
written
on
it
placing
the
renault
beside
the
fords
she
opened
the
door
within
five
frenchmen
were
drinking
at
one
table
and
four
americans
at
another
the
americans
sprang
up
and
claimed
her
first
as
their
own
kin
and
then
at
least
as
a
blood
sister
they
gave
her
coffee
and
would
not
let
her
pay
but
she
sat
uneasily
with
them
for
which
nation
do
you
work
there
are
no
english
here
they
said
i
am
in
the
french
army
gee
what
a
rotten
job
they
murmured
sympathetically
where
have
you
come
from
we
just
come
back
from
germany
and
you
bet
it
good
up
there
good
every
darn
thing
you
want
good
beds
good
food
and
thank
god
one
can
speak
the
lingo
you
do
speak
french
then
you
bet
not
why
do
you
learn
might
it
be
useful
to
you
useful
oh
when
you
get
back
home
in
business
perhaps
said
the
biggest
american
leaning
earnestly
towards
her
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
if
any
man
comes
up
to
me
back
in
the
states
and
starts
on
me
with
that
darn
language
i
drop
him
one
and
german
is
easier
oh
well
german
we
learn
in
the
schools
you
see
how
far
do
you
make
it
to
st
quentin
are
you
going
there
on
those
fords
we
hope
to
but
we
started
a
convoy
of
twenty
this
morning
and
these
here
four
cars
are
all
we
seen
since
lunch
i
hardly
think
you
get
as
far
as
quentin
and
little
enough
to
sleep
in
on
the
way
i
should
stay
here
she
rose
i
wish
you
luck
she
thanked
them
for
their
coffee
nodded
to
the
quiet
french
table
and
went
out
one
american
followed
her
can
you
buzz
her
round
he
asked
kindly
and
taking
the
handle
buzzed
her
round
i
bet
you
do
get
any
one
to
do
that
for
you
in
your
army
do
you
he
asked
as
he
straightened
himself
from
the
starting
handle
she
put
her
gear
in
with
a
little
bang
of
anger
you
kind
she
said
and
they
are
kind
that
you
ca
see
it
is
all
a
question
of
language
every
village
is
full
of
bored
americans
with
nothing
to
do
and
never
one
of
them
buys
a
dictionary
if
it
villages
you
speak
of
it
is
dictionaries
is
needed
he
answered
is
plumbing
she
had
not
left
him
ten
minutes
before
one
of
her
tyres
punctured
alas
i
could
have
found
a
better
use
for
them
than
arguing
she
thought
ruefully
regretting
the
friendly
americans
as
she
changed
the
tyre
by
the
roadside
under
the
beam
from
her
own
lamps
when
it
was
done
she
sat
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
silent
car
the
moon
came
up
and
showed
her
the
battlements
of
the
ardennes
forest
standing
upon
the
crest
of
the
mountains
to
her
left
that
is
to
be
my
home
julien
was
in
paris
by
now
divested
of
his
uniform
sitting
by
a
great
fire
eating
civilised
food
a
strange
young
man
in
dark
clothes
she
wondered
what
he
would
wear
he
seemed
a
great
many
difficult
miles
away
that
he
should
be
in
a
heated
room
with
lights
and
flowers
and
a
spread
table
and
she
under
the
shadow
of
the
forest
watching
the
moon
rise
lengthened
the
miles
between
them
yet
though
she
would
have
given
much
to
have
him
with
her
she
would
have
given
nothing
to
change
places
with
him
the
road
left
the
forest
for
a
time
and
passed
over
bare
grass
hills
beneath
a
windy
sky
then
back
into
the
forest
again
hidden
from
the
moon
and
here
her
hunger
made
her
fanciful
and
she
started
at
the
noise
of
a
moving
bough
blew
her
horn
at
nothing
and
seemed
to
hear
the
overtaking
hum
of
a
car
that
never
drew
near
her
suddenly
on
the
left
in
a
ditch
a
dark
form
appeared
then
another
and
another
down
there
in
a
patch
of
grass
below
the
road
she
caught
sight
of
the
upturned
wheels
of
a
lorry
and
stopping
got
down
walked
to
the
ditch
and
looked
over
there
in
wild
disorder
lay
thirty
or
forty
lorries
and
cars
burnt
twisted
wheelless
broken
ravaged
while
on
the
wooden
sides
the
german
eagle
black
on
white
was
marked
what
what
can
have
happened
here
she
climbed
back
into
the
car
but
just
beyond
the
limit
of
her
lights
came
on
a
huge
mine
crater
and
the
road
seemed
to
hang
on
its
lip
and
die
for
ever
again
she
got
down
and
found
a
road
of
planks
shored
up
by
branches
of
trees
leading
round
on
the
left
edge
of
the
crater
to
firm
land
on
the
other
side
some
of
the
planks
were
missing
and
moving
carefully
around
the
crater
she
heard
others
tip
and
groan
beneath
her
could
that
have
been
a
convoy
caught
by
the
mine
or
was
it
a
dumping
ground
for
the
cars
unable
to
follow
in
the
retreat
the
mine
crater
which
was
big
enough
to
hold
a
small
villa
was
overgrown
now
at
the
bottom
with
a
little
grass
and
moss
on
and
on
and
on
till
she
fancied
the
moon
too
had
turned
as
the
sun
had
done
and
started
a
downward
course
it
grew
no
colder
she
grew
no
hungrier
but
losing
count
of
time
slipped
on
between
the
flying
tree
trunks
full
of
unwearied
content
at
last
a
light
shone
through
the
trees
and
by
a
wooden
bridge
which
led
over
another
crater
she
came
on
a
lonely
house
café
was
written
on
the
door
but
the
shutters
were
tight
shut
and
only
a
line
of
light
shone
from
a
crack
from
within
came
sounds
of
laughter
and
men
voices
she
knocked
and
there
was
an
instant
silence
but
no
one
came
to
answer
at
length
the
bolts
were
withdrawn
and
the
head
of
an
old
woman
appeared
through
the
door
which
was
cautiously
opened
a
little
an
omelette
coffee
you
do
know
what
you
speak
of
we
have
no
eggs
then
coffee
no
no
nothing
at
all
go
on
to
charleville
we
have
nothing
how
far
is
charleville
but
the
door
shut
again
the
bolts
were
shot
and
a
man
voice
growled
in
the
hidden
room
behind
dubious
hole
yet
it
looks
as
though
a
big
town
were
near
and
down
the
next
slope
she
ran
into
charleville
the
town
had
been
long
abed
the
street
lamps
were
out
the
cobbles
wet
and
shining
on
the
main
boulevard
one
dark
figure
hurried
along
which
is
the
lion
she
called
her
voice
echoing
in
the
empty
street
soon
between
rugs
on
a
bed
in
the
silver
lion
between
a
single
sheet
doubled
in
two
she
slept
propping
the
lockless
door
with
her
suitcase
the
renault
slept
or
watched
below
in
the
courtyard
the
moon
sank
the
small
hours
passed
the
day
broke
the
first
day
in
charleville
part
iv
spring
in
charleville
chapter
xvii
the
stuffed
owl
a
stuffed
bird
stood
upon
a
windless
branch
and
through
a
window
of
blue
and
orange
squares
of
glass
a
broken
moon
stared
in
a
bedroom
formed
from
a
a
basin
to
wash
in
upon
a
red
plush
table
no
glass
no
jug
no
lock
upon
the
door
instead
gilt
mirrors
three
bell
ropes
and
a
barometer
a
bed
with
a
mattress
upon
it
and
nothing
more
this
was
her
kingdom
beyond
a
town
without
lights
without
a
station
without
a
milkshop
without
a
meat
shop
without
sheets
without
blankets
crockery
cooking
pans
or
locks
upon
the
doors
a
population
and
poor
a
sky
black
as
ink
and
liquid
as
a
river
prisoners
in
the
streets
moving
in
gangs
prisoners
in
the
gutters
pushing
long
scoops
to
stay
the
everlasting
tide
of
mud
thin
hungry
fierce
and
sad
prisoners
like
bedraggled
parrots
the
population
the
candle
of
the
world
was
snuffed
out
and
the
wick
smoked
the
light
was
gone
the
blinding
light
of
the
chantilly
snows
the
lights
on
the
précy
river
moonlight
sunlight
the
little
boat
crossing
at
moonrise
sunrise
ah
that
long
journey
how
i
pressed
on
how
i
fled
from
amiens
what
not
charleville
yet
i
said
is
it
charleville
soon
what
hurry
was
there
then
to
get
there
the
stuffed
bird
eyed
her
from
his
unstirring
branch
and
that
yellow
eye
seemed
to
answer
none
none
this
is
his
home
his
country
he
told
me
it
was
beautiful
but
i
can
not
see
beauty
i
am
empty
of
happiness
where
is
the
beauty
and
the
vile
bird
winking
in
the
candle
light
replied
nowhere
but
he
lied
perhaps
she
had
been
sent
stuffed
as
he
was
from
paris
perhaps
he
had
never
flown
behind
the
town
and
seen
the
wild
mountains
that
began
at
the
last
house
on
the
other
bank
of
the
river
or
the
river
itself
greener
than
any
other
which
flowed
over
black
rocks
in
cold
gulleys
the
meuse
flowing
to
dinant
to
namur
perhaps
from
his
interminable
boulevard
he
had
never
seen
the
lovely
spanish
square
of
red
and
yellow
its
houses
standing
upon
arches
or
the
proud
duc
charles
de
gonzague
who
strutted
for
ever
upon
his
pedestal
his
stone
cape
slipping
from
one
shoulder
his
gay
spaniard
hat
upon
his
head
holding
back
a
smile
from
his
handsome
lips
lest
the
town
which
he
had
come
over
the
mountains
to
found
should
see
him
tolerant
and
sin
beneath
his
gaze
that
bird
knew
the
rain
would
stop
knew
it
in
his
dusty
feathers
but
he
would
not
kindle
hope
he
knew
there
was
a
yellow
spring
at
hand
but
he
left
her
to
mourn
for
the
white
lustre
of
chantilly
vile
bird
she
blew
out
the
candle
that
he
might
wink
no
more
i
will
buy
a
padlock
and
a
key
if
among
these
gilt
mirrors
i
can
have
no
other
charm
i
will
have
solitude
and
having
hung
a
thought
a
plan
a
hope
before
her
in
the
future
she
slept
till
day
broke
the
second
day
in
charleville
she
woke
a
mixture
of
courage
and
philosophy
i
can
stand
anything
and
beyond
a
certain
limit
misfortune
makes
me
laugh
but
there
no
reason
why
i
should
stand
this
the
key
and
padlock
idea
was
rejected
as
a
compromise
with
happiness
no
no
let
us
see
if
we
can
get
something
better
to
lock
up
than
that
bird
he
looked
uncommonly
dead
by
daylight
i
would
rather
lock
up
an
empty
room
and
leave
it
pure
when
i
must
leave
it
dressing
she
went
quickly
down
the
street
to
the
bureau
de
la
place
the
clerks
and
secretaries
nodded
and
smiled
at
each
other
and
bent
their
heads
over
their
typewriters
when
she
looked
at
them
can
i
see
the
billeting
lieutenant
he
is
not
here
i
saw
him
enter
we
will
go
and
see
she
drummed
upon
the
table
with
her
fingers
and
the
clerks
and
secretaries
winked
and
nodded
more
meaningly
than
ever
mademoiselle
he
will
see
you
the
lieutenant
with
was
upon
his
feet
looking
at
her
curiously
as
she
entered
the
adjoining
room
good
morning
mademoiselle
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
billet
that
i
found
you
yesterday
she
looked
at
him
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
beam
in
his
creased
mouth
there
was
an
upward
curve
the
story
of
legitimate
complaint
that
she
had
prepared
drooped
in
her
mind
she
looked
at
him
a
little
longer
hesitated
then
risking
everything
monsieur
there
is
a
stuffed
owl
in
the
room
he
did
not
wince
take
it
out
mademoiselle
h
yes
i
can
not
see
heaven
except
through
orange
glass
open
the
window
it
is
fixed
then
he
failed
her
he
was
a
busy
sensible
man
mademoiselle
i
find
you
a
billet
i
instal
you
and
you
come
to
me
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
with
this
ridiculous
story
of
an
owl
it
reasonable
the
door
opened
and
his
superior
officer
walked
in
a
stern
captain
with
no
crease
about
his
mouth
no
beam
in
his
olive
eye
ah
now
now
the
lieutenant
had
but
to
turn
to
his
superior
officer
and
she
would
indeed
be
rent
and
reasonably
so
what
is
the
matter
said
the
newcomer
is
something
fresh
needed
the
billeting
lieutenant
never
hesitated
a
second
unfortunately
the
billet
found
yesterday
for
this
lady
is
unsuitable
the
owner
of
the
house
returns
this
week
and
needs
the
room
have
you
some
other
lodging
for
her
yes
in
the
rue
de
clèves
good
then
there
is
no
difficulty
none
follow
me
mademoiselle
the
street
is
near
i
will
take
you
to
the
she
followed
him
down
the
stairs
and
caught
him
up
upon
the
pavement
you
may
think
mademoiselle
that
it
is
because
i
am
young
and
susceptible
oh
no
no
indeed
i
young
but
i
slept
in
that
room
myself
the
first
night
i
came
to
charleville
my
room
with
the
owl
do
you
mean
that
yes
i
put
him
upon
the
landing
but
even
then
i
dared
not
break
the
window
here
is
the
street
how
you
frightened
me
when
your
captain
came
in
how
grateful
i
am
and
how
delighted
is
the
house
here
mademoiselle
i
do
not
truly
know
what
to
do
is
an
empty
so
much
the
better
but
you
are
not
afraid
oh
no
no
not
at
all
has
it
any
furniture
very
little
we
will
see
he
pulled
the
bell
at
an
iron
railing
and
the
gate
opened
a
beautiful
face
looked
out
of
the
window
and
a
young
woman
called
bien
officers
i
told
you
we
have
not
room
for
one
more
now
come
come
elsie
not
so
sharp
it
is
for
the
house
opposite
this
time
have
you
the
key
but
the
house
opposite
is
empty
it
will
not
be
when
i
have
put
mademoiselle
into
it
alone
of
course
the
young
under
the
impression
that
he
was
certainly
installing
his
mistress
left
the
window
and
came
through
the
gate
with
a
look
of
impish
reproof
in
her
eyes
together
they
crossed
the
road
and
she
fitted
the
key
into
a
green
iron
door
let
into
the
face
of
a
yellow
wall
within
was
a
courtyard
leading
to
a
garden
and
from
the
courtyard
steps
in
an
inner
wall
led
up
into
the
house
all
this
all
this
mine
all
yours
mademoiselle
the
garden
a
deserted
tangle
of
fruit
trees
and
bushes
fallen
statues
arbours
and
grass
lawn
brown
with
fallen
leaves
was
walled
in
by
a
high
wall
which
kept
it
from
every
eye
but
heaven
the
house
was
large
the
staircase
wide
and
low
the
rooms
square
and
high
filled
with
windows
and
painted
in
dusty
shades
of
cream
in
every
room
as
they
passed
through
them
lay
a
drift
of
broken
and
soiled
furniture
as
brown
and
mouldering
as
the
leaves
upon
the
lawn
who
lived
here
who
lived
here
echoed
the
and
a
strange
look
passed
over
her
face
many
men
austrians
turks
bulgarians
germans
were
you
then
in
charleville
all
the
time
all
the
time
i
knew
them
all
in
her
eyes
there
flitted
the
image
of
enemies
who
had
cried
gaily
to
her
from
the
street
as
she
leant
out
of
the
open
window
of
the
house
opposite
take
anything
she
said
with
a
shrug
to
fanny
see
what
you
can
make
from
it
if
you
can
make
one
room
habitable
from
this
you
are
welcome
see
there
is
at
least
a
saucepan
take
that
so
much
has
gone
from
the
house
in
these
last
years
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
retain
a
saucepan
for
the
owner
who
is
the
owner
a
rich
lady
who
can
afford
it
the
richest
family
in
charleville
she
has
turned
she
will
abuse
me
when
she
comes
here
to
see
this
as
though
could
have
saved
it
her
husband
and
her
son
were
killed
georges
et
phillippe
georges
was
killed
the
first
day
of
the
war
and
phillippe
i
do
know
when
but
somewhere
near
here
you
think
she
will
come
back
sometimes
i
think
it
she
has
such
a
sense
of
property
but
her
daughter
writes
that
it
would
kill
her
to
come
phillippe
was
the
sun
was
the
good
god
to
her
i
must
go
back
to
my
work
said
the
lieutenant
can
you
be
happy
here
in
this
empty
house
there
will
be
rats
i
can
be
very
happy
and
so
grateful
i
will
move
my
things
across
my
companions
that
is
to
say
six
more
of
us
arrive
in
convoy
from
chantilly
six
more
had
you
told
me
that
before
but
what
more
simple
i
can
put
them
all
in
here
there
is
room
for
twenty
oh
her
face
fell
and
she
stood
aghast
and
you
gave
me
this
house
for
myself
and
i
was
so
happy
you
are
terrible
if
my
business
was
to
lodge
soldiers
of
your
sex
every
day
i
should
be
you
can
not
lodge
with
an
owl
you
can
not
lodge
with
your
compatriots
yet
you
were
joking
when
you
said
you
would
put
us
all
here
i
was
joking
take
the
house
the
rats
and
the
rubbish
included
with
it
no
one
will
disturb
you
till
the
owner
comes
i
have
another
a
better
a
cleaner
house
in
my
mind
for
your
companions
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
work
will
you
ask
me
to
tea
one
day
i
promise
the
moment
i
have
one
ready
he
left
her
and
she
explored
the
upper
storey
with
the
i
should
have
this
for
your
bedroom
and
this
adjoining
for
your
the
windows
look
in
the
street
and
you
can
see
life
fanny
agreed
it
pleased
her
better
to
look
in
the
street
than
into
the
garden
the
two
rooms
were
large
and
square
old
blue
curtains
of
brocade
still
hung
from
the
windows
in
the
inner
room
was
a
vast
oak
bed
and
a
turkey
carpet
of
soft
red
and
blue
the
fireplaces
were
of
open
brick
and
suitable
for
logs
both
rooms
were
bare
of
any
other
furniture
i
will
find
you
the
mattress
to
match
that
bed
i
hid
it
it
is
in
the
house
opposite
she
went
away
to
dust
it
and
find
a
man
to
help
her
carry
it
across
the
road
fanny
fetched
her
luggage
from
her
previous
billet
borrowed
six
logs
and
some
twigs
from
the
promising
to
fetch
her
an
ample
store
from
the
hills
around
all
day
she
rummaged
in
the
empty
house
finding
now
a
armchair
which
she
propped
up
with
a
stone
now
a
single
venetian
glass
scrolled
in
gold
for
her
tooth
glass
in
a
small
room
on
the
ground
floor
a
beautiful
piece
of
tapestry
lay
rolled
in
a
dusty
corner
pale
birds
of
tarnished
silver
flew
across
its
blue
ground
and
on
the
border
were
willows
and
rivers
it
covered
her
oak
bed
exactly
and
by
removing
the
pillows
it
looked
like
a
comfortable
and
venerable
divan
the
logs
in
the
fire
were
soon
burnt
through
and
she
did
not
like
to
ask
for
more
but
leaving
her
room
and
wandering
up
and
down
the
empty
house
in
the
long
pale
afternoon
she
searched
for
fragments
of
wood
that
might
serve
her
a
narrow
door
built
on
a
curve
of
the
staircase
led
to
an
upper
storey
of
large
attics
and
her
first
dazzled
thought
was
of
potential
loot
for
her
bedroom
a
faint
afternoon
sun
drained
through
the
lattice
over
floors
that
were
heaped
with
household
goods
a
feathered
brush
for
cobwebs
hung
on
a
nail
she
took
it
joyfully
below
it
stood
an
iron
lattice
for
holding
a
kettle
on
an
open
fire
that
too
she
put
aside
but
soon
the
attics
opened
too
much
treasure
the
boy
things
were
everywhere
the
father
and
the
son
her
eyes
took
in
the
host
of
relics
till
her
spirit
was
living
in
the
lost
playgrounds
of
their
youth
pressing
among
phantoms
irons
for
ironing
for
my
collars
but
they
were
so
small
too
small
his
again
the
son
yet
why
should
i
use
them
she
thought
and
slung
the
little
pair
upon
one
finger
crossing
to
the
second
attic
she
came
upon
all
the
toys
it
seemed
as
though
nothing
had
ever
been
packed
up
dolls
houses
slates
weighing
machines
marbles
picture
books
little
swords
and
guns
and
strange
boxes
full
of
broken
things
returning
to
the
floor
below
with
empty
hands
she
brooded
by
the
embers
and
shivered
in
her
happy
loneliness
julien
was
no
longer
someone
whom
she
had
left
behind
but
someone
whom
she
expected
he
would
be
here
how
soon
in
four
days
in
five
in
six
there
would
be
a
letter
at
the
silver
lion
since
she
had
found
this
house
this
perfect
house
in
which
to
live
alone
and
happy
the
town
outside
had
changed
was
expectant
with
her
and
full
of
his
presence
but
ah
inhuman
was
julien
alone
responsible
for
this
happiness
was
she
not
weaving
already
from
her
blue
curtains
from
her
soft
embers
from
the
branches
of
mimosa
which
she
had
bought
in
the
and
placed
in
a
thin
glass
upon
the
mantelpiece
from
the
gracious
silence
of
the
house
from
her
solitude
chapter

philippe
house
what
a
struggle
to
get
wood
for
that
fire
coal
would
burn
in
the
open
hearth
she
had
begged
a
little
wood
from
the
cook
in
the
garage
but
it
was
wet
and
hissed
and
all
her
fire
died
down
wood
proved
so
abundant
on
the
hills
as
she
had
hoped
either
it
was
cut
and
had
been
taken
by
the
germans
or
grew
in
solid
and
forbidding
branches
all
the
small
broken
branches
and
twigs
of
winter
had
been
collected
by
the
shivering
population
of
the
town
and
drawn
down
from
the
mountains
on
trays
slung
on
ropes
stooping
over
her
two
wet
logs
she
drenched
them
with
paraffin
then
when
she
had
used
the
last
drop
in
her
tin
got
down
her
petrol
bottle
i
shall
lose
all
my
hair
one
day
doing
this
the
white
flame
licked
hungrily
out
towards
her
but
it
too
died
down
leaving
the
wet
wood
as
angrily
cold
as
ever
going
downstairs
she
searched
the
courtyard
and
the
hayloft
but
the
bulgarians
and
turks
of
the
past
had
burnt
every
bit
and
any
twigs
in
the
garden
were
as
wet
as
those
which
spluttered
in
the
hearth
then
up
to
the
attics
again
i
have
wood
she
exclaimed
angrily
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
broken
white
wood
from
the
floor
it
had
philippe
seret
scrawled
across
it
in
pencil
why
it
your
name
she
said
wonderingly
and
held
the
piece
of
wood
in
her
hand
the
place
was
all
wood
there
was
wood
here
to
last
her
weeks

with

all
over
it
and
in
the
corner

and
boxes
of
things
he
would
want

if
he
saw
them
now
throw
it
away

of

tubes
he
had
blown
when
he
was
fifteen
boxes
of
dried

i
must
have
wood
she
said
aloud
and
picked
up
another
useless
fragment
it
mocked
her
it
would
listen
to
her
need
of
wood
it
had
in
clumsy
inserted
wires
at
the
back
his
stamp
under
it
was
a
grey
book
called
grammaire
allemande
it
was
any
use
your
learning
german
was
it
philippe
she
said
then
stood
still
in
a
frozen
conjecture
as
to
the
use
and
goal
of
all
that
bright
treasure
in
his
mind
his
his
modelling
the
cast
head
of
a
man
she
had
found
stamped
with
his
initial
the
things
he
had
written
and
read
on
slates
in
books
it
was
as
much
use
his
learning
german
as
anything
else
she
said
slowly
and
her
mind
reeled
at
the
edge
of
difficult
questions
coming
down
from
the
attics
again
she
held
one
piece
of
polished
in
her
hand
how
can
i
live
in
their
family
like
this
she
mused
by
the
fire
i
am
doing
more
i
am
living
in
the
dreadful
background
to
which
they
or
wo
come
back
i
am
counting
the
toys
which
they
ca
look
at
your
mother
will
never
come
back
to
pack
them
up
philippe
she
made
herself
chocolate
and
drank
it
from
a
fine
white
cup
with
his
mother
initials
on
it
in
gold
work
was
over
for
the
day
and
she
walked
down
the
main
street
by
the
silver
lion
from
whose
windows
she
daily
expected
that
julien
voice
would
call
to
her
mademoiselle
has
no
correspondence
said
the
girl
looking
down
at
her
from
her
high
seat
behind
the
mugs
and
glasses
he
ought
to
be
here
or
as
he
has
written
and
even
at
that
moment
thought
she
heard
hurrying
feet
behind
her
and
turned
quickly
searching
with
her
eyes
an
old
civilian
ran
past
her
and
climbed
into
the
back
of
a
waiting
lorry
i
am
in
no
hurry
she
said
sure
that
he
would
come
and
walked
on
into
the
spanish
square
to
stare
in
the
shops
behind
the
arcaded
pillars
merchandise
trickled
back
into
the
empty
town
in
odd
ways
by
lorry
train
and
touring
car
merchants
penetrated
and
filled
the
shops
with
provisions
amongst
which
there
were
distressing
lacks
the
trains
which
had
now
been
extended
from
rheims
over
many
laborious
wooden
bridges
stopped
short
of
charleville
by
four
miles
as
the
bridges
over
the
meuse
had
not
yet
been
made
strong
enough
to
support
a
railroad
to
the
passenger
train
which
left
paris
twice
a
week
one
goods
truck
full
of
merchandise
was
attached
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
particular
truck
to
arrive
was
singled
out
casually
without
any
regard
to
the
needs
of
the
town
as
yet
no
dusters
sheets
or
kitchen
pans
could
be
bought
but
in
the
spanish
square
every
shop
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
rolls
of
ladies
stays
even
the
chemist
had
put
a
pair
in
the
corner
of
his
window
fanny
inquired
the
cause
a
truck
had
arrived
filled
with
nothing
but
stays
it
was
very
unfortunate
as
they
had
expected
condensed
milk
but
they
had
accepted
the
truck
as
no
doubt
they
would
find
means
of
selling
them
for
there
were
women
in
the
country
round
who
had
not
seen
a
pair
for
years
a
man
appeared
in
the
square
selling
boots
from
paris
the
first
to
come
to
the
town
with
leather
soles
instead
of
wooden
ones
instantly
there
was
a
crowd
round
him
it
was
dark
now
and
the
electric
street
lamps
were
lit
round
the
pedestal
of
the
spanish
duke
the
organisation
of
the
town
was
jerky
and
often
the
lights
would
come
on
when
it
was
daylight
and
often
disappear
when
it
was
dark
where
germans
had
been
there
were
always
electric
light
and
telephones
no
matter
how
sparse
the
furniture
in
the
houses
how
ragged
the
roof
how
patched
the
windows
what
tin
cans
paper
and
rubbish
lay
heaped
upon
the
floors
the
electric
light
unfailingly
illumined
all
the
telephone
hung
upon
the
wall
among
the
peeling
paper
a
little
rain
began
to
fall
lightly
and
she
hurried
to
her
rooms
there
once
within
the
padlock
slipped
through
the
rings
and
locked
the
fire
lighted
the
lamps
lit
the
room
glowed
before
her
the
turkey
carpet
showed
all
its
blues
and
reds
the
mimosa
drooped
above
the
mantelpiece
the
willow
palm
in
the
jar
was
turning
yellow
and
shedding
a
faint
down
you
must
last
till
he
comes
to
tea
she
rebuked
it
but
down
it
fluttered
past
the
mirror
on
to
the
carpet
he
will
be
here
before
they
all
fall
she
thought
and
propped
open
her
window
that
she
might
hear
his
voice
if
he
called
her
from
the
street
below
she
boiled
her
kettle
to
make
chocolate
hanging
it
upon
a
croquet
hoop
which
she
had
found
in
the
garden
philippe
hoop
but
philippe
was
so
powerless
he
could
even
stop
his
croquet
hoop
from
being
heated
in
the
flames
as
a
one
must
be
sensible
he
would
allow
it
that
was
the
sort
of
device
he
would
have
thought
well
of
he
rushed
about
the
town
on
a
the
had
said
when
asked
about
him
but
that
was
later
there
had
been
other
times
when
he
had
rocked
a
broken
a
doll
head
sold
meat
from
a
wooden
shop
fed
a
dormouse
did
philippe
she
wondered
have
adventures
too
in
this
street
she
felt
him
in
the
curtains
under
the
carpet
like
a
little
wind
the
days
passed
each
day
her
car
was
ordered
and
ran
to
rheims
and
chalons
through
the
battlefields
or
through
the
mountains
to

dinant
or

passed
over

quickly
as
the
shades
of
flying
clouds
the
spring
growth
at
every
stage
and
age
from
valley
to
crest
shook
like
light
before
the
eyes
there
were
signs
of
spring
too
in
the
battlefields
cowslips
grew
in
the
ditches
and
grass
itself
as
rare
and
bright
as
a
flower
broke
out
upon
the
plains
a
furtive
and
elementary
civilisation
began
to
creep
back
upon
the
borders
of
the
national
roads
pioneers
with
hand
dog
and
donkey
carts
with
too
little
money
with
too
many
children
with
obstinate
and
tenacious
courage
began
to
establish
themselves
in
cellars
and
in
wooden
shelters
scraped
together
from
the
of
their
former
villages
in
those
communities
of
six
or
seven
families
the
and
early
struggles
of
civilisation

of
soil

size
of

in
and
placed

miserable
hen
within
little
notices
would
appear
nailed
to
poles
emerging
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
or
small
motor
repairs
done
here
all
this
was
noticeable
along
the
great
national
roads
but
in
the
side
roads
roads
deep
in
yellow
mud
uncleared
empty
of
lorries
and
cars
no
one
set
up
his
habitation
a
certain
lawlessness
was
abroad
in
the
lonelier
areas
of
the
battlefields
odds
and
ends
of
all
the
armies
deserters
well
hidden
during
many
months
lived
under
the
earth
in
holes
and
cellars
and
used
strange
means
to
gain
a
living
there
had
been
rumours
of
lonely
cars
which
had
been
stopped
and
robbed
and
among
the
settlers
a
couple
of
murders
had
taken
place
in
a
single
district
the
mail
from
charleville
to
montmédy
was
held
up
at
last
by
men
in
masks
armed
with
revolvers
we
will
go
out
armed
exclaimed
the
drivers
in
the
garage
and
polished
up
their
rifles
after
that
when
the
americans
hi
the
camps
around
hungry
upon
the
french
ration
or
drunk
upon
the
mixture
of
methylated
spirits
and
whisky
sold
in

of
ruined
villages
picked
a
quarrel
there
were
deaths
instead
of
broken
heads
and
black
eyes
they
must
they
must
go
home
said
the
french
turning
their
easy
wrath
upon
the
homesick
americans
somewhere
beyond
rheims
the
wreck
of
a
cindery
village
sprawled
along
a
side
road
not
a
chimney
not
a
pile
of
bricks
not
a
finger
of
wood
or
stone
reached
three
feet
high
but
in
the
middle
a
little
wooden
stake
rose
above
the
rubbish
a
pointing
into
the
ground
and
the
words
written
in
chalk
upon
it
fanny
who
was
thirsty
drew
up
her
car
and
climbed
across
the
village
to
a
hole
down
which
the
board
pointed
steps
of
pressed
earth
led
down
and
from
the
hole
rose
the
quarrelling
fierce
voices
of
three
men
she
fled
back
to
the
car
determined
to
find
a
more
genial
upon
a
national
road
the
same
day
upon
another
side
road
she
came
on
the
remains
of
a
village
where
the
road
instead
of
leading
through
it
paused
at
the
brink
of
the
river
over
which
hung
the
end
spars
of
a
broken
bridge
i
will
make
a
meal
here
she
thought
profiting
by
the
check
and
pulled
out
a
packet
of
sandwiches
driving
her
car
round
the
corner
of
a
wall
out
of
the
wind
here
across
the
road
a
donkey
cart
was
standing
and
a
donkey
was
tied
to
a
brick
in
the
gutter
upon
the
steps
of
a
doorway
which
was
but
an
aperture
leading
to
nothing
for
the
house
itself
lay
flat
behind
it
and
the
courtyard
was
filled
with
trestles
of
barbed
wire
a
figure
was
seated
writing
earnestly
upon
its
knees
she
went
nearer
and
saw
an
old
man
who
looked
up
as
she
approached
sir
she
began
meaning
to
inquire
about
the
road
and
the
wind
through
the
doorway
blew
her
skirt
tight
against
her
i
am
identifying
the
houses
he
said
as
though
he
expected
to
be
asked
his
business
she
saw
by
his
face
that
he
was
very
old
eighty
perhaps
the
book
upon
his
knee
contained
quavering
drawings
against
each
of
which
a
name
was
written
this
is
mine
he
said
pointing
through
the
doorway
on
whose
step
he
sat
and
all
these
other
houses
belong
to
people
whom
i
know
when
they
come
back
here
to
live
they
have
only
to
come
to
me
and
i
can
show
them
which
house
to
go
to
without
me
it
might
be
difficult
but
i
was
the
oldest
man
here
and
i
know
all
the
streets
and
all
the
houses
i
carry
the
village
in
my
head
that
is
your
donkey
cart
then
it
is
my
son
i
drive
here
from
rheims
on
saturdays
when
he
want
it
he
showed
his
book
the
cheap
paper
filled
with
maps
blurred
names
and
vague
sketches
the
old
man
was
in
his
dotage
and
would
soon
die
and
the
book
be
lost
i
carry
the
village
in
my
head
he
repeated
it
was
the
only
life
the
village
had
so
the
days
went
on
day
after
day
and
with
each
its
work
and
still
no
letter
at
the
silver
lion
though
vaguely
ashamed
at
her
mood
she
could
not
be
oppressed
by
this
each
cold
fine
blooming
day
in
the
mountains
made
him
less
necessary
to
her
and
only
the
delicate
memory
of
him
remained
to
gild
the
town
when
hopes
wither
other
hopes
spring
up
when
the
touch
of
charm
trembles
no
more
upon
the
heart
it
can
no
longer
be
imagined

the

of

was
driving
across

and

painted
the
open
square
till
rustling
and
turning
towards

she
awoke
at
the
top
of
the
window
a
magpie
wiped
his
beak
on
a
branch
bent
head
and
tail
bent
to
balance
him
then
dropped
like

pebble
out
of

sat
up
drew

prepared
overnight
towards
her

for
the
chocolate
thinking
of
the
dim
julien
who
might
pay
his
beautiful
visit
in

with
the
moon
and
the
sun
she
got
up
and
dressed
and
walked
in
the
spring
morning
first
to
the
bread
shop
to
buy
a
pound
of
bread
from
the
woman
who
would
smile
so
serious
and
puzzling
was
this
defect
that
fanny
had
once
asked
her
would
you
rather
i
did
buy
my
bread
here
no

then
to
the
market
for
a
bunch
of
violets
and
an
egg
and
at
last
through
the
silver
lion
for
luck
opening
one
door
of
black
wood
passing
through
the
hot
sunny
room
ignoring
the
thrilled
glances
of
soldiers
drinking
at
the
tables
looking
towards
the
girl
at
the
bar
who
shook
her
head
saying
no
no
letter
for
you
and
out
again
into
the
street
by
the
other
black
door
which
was
gold
inside
she
passed
the
morning
in
the
garage
working
on
the
renault
cleaning
her
oiling
her
then
ate
her
lunch
in
the
garage
room
with
the
section
among
them
there
ran
a
rumour
of
england
of
approaching
demobilisation
of
military
driving
that
must
come
to
an
end
to
give
place
to

the

upon

she
heard
the

faces
swam
so
close
to
hers
that
she
looked
in

spoke
to

with

in
the
i
asked
for
a
tin
of
milk
and
i
was
told
are
keeping
the
milk
for
the
civils
the
civils
i
said
for
we
are
all
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
the
army
feeds
first
oh
that
all
gone
we
are
losing
importance
now
it
is
time
to
go
home
as
they
spoke
there
came
a
shrill
whistle
which
sounded
through
charleville
ecoute
said
a
man
down
the
street
and
the
section
moving
to
the
window
heard
it
again
nameless
and
yet
familiar
unseen
charleville
lifted
its
head
and
said
ecoute
the
first
train
had
crawled
over
the
new
bridge
and
stood
whistling
its
triumph
in
the
station
as
spring
became
more
than
a
bright
light
over
the
mountains
so
the
town
in
the
hollow
blossomed
and
functioned
the
gate
bells
rang
the
electric
light
ceased
to
glow
in
the
daytime
great
cranes
came
up
on
the
trains
and
fished
in
the
river
for
the
wallowing
bridges
workmen
arrived
in
the
streets
in
the
early
summer
mornings
tapping
could
be
heard
all
about
the
town
civilians
in
new
black
suits
civilians
more
or
less
damaged
limping
or
did
things
that
made
them
happy
with
a
hammer
and
a
nail
they
whistled
as
they
tapped
nailed
up
shutters
that
had
hung
for
four
years
by
one
hinge
climbed
about
the
roofs
and
fixed
a
tile
or
two
where
a
hundred
were
needed
brought
little
ladders
on
borrowed
wheelbarrows
and
set
them
against
the
in
the
house
opposite
in
the
rue
de
clèves
a
man
was
using
his
old
blue
puttees
to
nail
up
his
all
the
men
worked
in
new
sunday
clothes
they
had
as
yet
nothing
old
to
work
in
every
day
brought
more
of
them
to
the
town
lorries
and
horse
carts
set
them
down
by
the
silver
lion
and
they
walked
along
the
street
carrying
black
bags
and
rolls
of
carpet
boxes
of
tools
and
sometimes
a
carbine
yes
we
must
go
home
said
the
englishwomen
it
time
to
leave
the
town
the
civils
seemed
to
drive
them
out
they
knew
they
were
birds
of
passage
as
they
walked
in
the
sun
in
their
khaki
coats
the
civils
were
blind
to
them
never
looked
at
them
hurried
on
longing
to
grasp
the
symbolic
hammer
to
dust
sweep
out
the
german
rags
and
rubbish
nail
talc
over
the
gaping
windows
set
their
homes
going
start
their
factories
in
the
surrounding
mountains
people
the
houses
so
long
the
mere
shelter
for
passing
troops
light
the
civilian
life
of
the
town
and
set
it
burning
after
the
ashes
and
dust
of
war
there
were
days
when
every
owner
and
in
his
sleeves
seemed
to
be
burning
the
contents
of
his
house
in
a
bonfire
in
the
gutter
poor
men
burned
things
that
seemed
useful
to
the
casual
eye
mattresses
bolsters
all
soiled
soiled
again
and
polluted
by
four
years
of
soldiery
idling
over
the
fire
in
the
evening
fanny
eye
was
caught
by
a
stain
upon
her
armchair
it
was
sticky
it
might
well
be
champagne
the
champagne
which
stuck
even
now
to
the
bottoms
of
the
glasses
downstairs
i
wonder
if
they
will
burn
the
chair
when
come
back
some
one
must
come
back
some
day
even
if
philippe
mother
never
came
she
seemed
to
see
the
figure
of
the
turkish
officer
seated
in
her
chair
just
as
the
had
described
him
stout
fezzed
resting
his
legs
before
her
fire
or
of
the
german
stretched
back
in
the
chair
in
the
evening
reading
the
copy
of
the
she
had
found
stuffed
down
in
the
corner
of
the
seat
how
how
did
that
splash
of
wax
come
to
be
so
high
up
on
the
face
of
the
mirror
had
someone
some
predecessor
thrown
a
candle
in
a
temper
it
puzzled
her
in
the
morning
as
she
lay
in
bed
on
the
polished
wooden
foot
of
the
bed
was
burnt
the
outline
of
a
face
with
a
funny
nose
a
child
drawing
that
was
philippe
the
nurse
had
cried
at
him
in
a
rage
perhaps
and
snatched
the
hot
poker
with
which
he
drew
and
that
had
made
the
long
rushing
burn
that
flew
angrily
across
the
wood
from
the
base
of
the
face
chin
oh
you
made
it
worse
philippe
must
have
gibed
b
who
wrote
b
on
the
wall
the
bulgarian
she
fell
asleep
the
first
bird
waking
early
threw
the
image
of
the
world
across
her
lonely
sleep
he
squeaked
alone
minute
after
minute
from
his
tree
outside
the
window
thrusting
forests
swamps
meadows
mountains
in
among
her
dreams
then
a
fellow
joined
him
and
soon
all
the
birds
were
shouting
from
their
trees
slowly
the
room
lightened
till
on
the
mantelpiece
the
buds
of
the
apple
blossom
shone
till
upon
the
wall
the
dark
patch
became
an
oil
painting
till
the
painting
showed
its
features
a
castle
a
river
and
a
hill
in
the
night
the
last
yellow
down
had
fallen
from
the
palm
upon
the
floor
the
common
voice
of
the
tin
clock
struck
seven
and
with
it
came
voices
women
voices
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
the
voice
of
the
and
another
some
instinct
some
strange
warning
sent
the
sleeper
on
the
bed
flying
from
it
dazed
as
she
was
snatching
at
the
initialled
cup
of
gold
veining
she
thrust
it
behind
the
curtain
on
the
window
sill
an
act
of
panic
merely
for
a
second
glance
round
the
room
convinced
her
that
there
was
too
much
to
be
hidden
if
hidden
anything
should
be
with
a
leap
she
was
back
in
bed
and
drew
the
bedclothes
up
to
her
neck
then
came
the
knock
at
the
door
i
am
in
bed
she
called
nevertheless
can
i
come
in
asked
the
you
may
come
in
the
young
woman
came
in
and
closed
the
door
after
her
she
approached
the
bed
and
whispered
then
glancing
round
the
room
with
a
shrug
she
picked
up
a
and
held
it
that
fanny
might
slip
her
arms
into
it
but
what
a
time
to
come
she
has
travelled
all
night
she
is
unfit
to
move
must
i
see
her
now
i
am
hardly
awake
i
can
not
keep
her
any
longer
she
was
for
coming
straight
here
when
the
train
came
in
at
five
i
have
kept
her
at
coffee
at
my
house
pis
you
have
a
right
to
be
here
the
drew
the
curtain
a
little
wider
and
the
cup
was
exposed
she
thrust
it
back
into
the
shadow
the
door
opened
and
mother
walked
in
she
was
very
tall
in
black
and
a
deep
veil
hung
before
her
face
madame
she
said
and
her
veiled
face
dipped
in
a
faint
salute
will
you
sit
down
she
took
no
notice
of
this
but
leaning
a
little
on
a
stick
she
carried
said
i
understand
that
it
is
right
that
i
should
find
my
house
occupied
they
told
me
it
would
be
by
an
officer
such
occupation
i
believe
ceases
on
the
return
of
the
owner
yes
madame
i
am
the
owner
of
this
house
yes
may
i
ask
of
what
nationality
you
are
the
standing
behind
her
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
as
if
she
would
say
i
have
explained
and
explained
again
i
am
english
madame
the
lady
seemed
to
sink
into
a
stupor
and
bending
her
head
in
silence
stared
at
the
floor
fanny
sitting
upright
in
bed
waited
for
her
to
speak
the
her
face
still
as
an
image
waited
too
philippe
mother
began
to
sway
upon
her
stick
do
please
sit
down
said
fanny
breaking
the
silence
at
last
when
will
you
go
demanded
the
old
lady
suddenly
go
who
gave
you
that
lamp
that
is
mine
she
pointed
to
a
glass
lamp
which
stood
upon
the
table
it
is
all
yours
said
fanny
humbly
mademoiselle
borrowed
it
said
the
voice
of
the
i
lent
it
to
her
why

my
things
lent
when
i
am

armchair
dirty
soiled
torn
paul
picture
there
is
a
hole
in
the
corner
who
made
that
hole
in
the
corner

did
said
fanny
feebly
wishing
that
she
were
dressed
and
upon
her
feet
madame
a
turkish
officer
made
the
hole
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
he
said
it
was
the
german
colonel
who
was
here
before
him
but
i
am
sure
it
was
the
turk
a
turk
said
philippe
mother
in
bewilderment
so
you
have
allowed
a
turk
to
come
in
here
madame
does
not
understand
oh
i
understand
well
enough
that
my
house
has
been
a
den
the
house
where
i
was
born
all
my
things
all
my
things
you
must
give
that
lamp
back

madame

give
everything
back

carpet

mother

walls

name
upon
them

my
windows

my
room
downstairs
with
rubbish
broken
my
furniture
but
i
am
told
this
is
what
i
must
expect
fanny
looked
at
her
petrified
but
i
she
began
you
do
understand
said
the
young
fiercely
do
you
know
who
has
lived
here
in
this
room
in
this
bed
turks
bulgars
germans
four
years
of
soldiers
coming
in
one
week
and
gone
the
next
i
could
not
stop
it
when
other
houses
were
burnt
i
would
say
to
myself

lucky
when
all
your
china
was
broken
and
your
chairs
used
for
firewood
could
i
help
it
can
help
it
she
is
your
last
soldier
and
she
has
taken
nothing
so
much
has
gone
from
this
house
it
is
not
worth
while
to
worry
about
what
remains
when
you
wrote
to
me
last
month
to
send
you
the
barometer
it
made
me
smile
your
barometer

madame

back
with
me
they

not
have

always
wilful
you

not
mean
to
live
here
i
wish
this
woman

madame
no

the
house
opposite
give
her
time
to
find
a
lodging
a
lodging
she
will
find
a
lodging
soon
enough
a
town
full
of
soldiers
muttered
the
old
woman
i
think
this
is
a
question
for
the
billeting
lieutenant
said
fanny
he
will
explain
to
you
that
i
am
billeted
here
exactly
as
a
soldier
that
i
have
a
right
to
be
here
until
your
arrival
it
will
be
kind
of
you
to
give
me
a
day
in
which
to
find
another
room
where
are
things
said
the
old
woman
unheedingly
i
must
go
up
to
the
attics
a
vision
of
those
broken
toys
came
to
fanny
the
dusty
heap
of
horses
dolls
and
boxes
the
poor
disorder
you
must
yet
she
cried
with
feeling
rest
first
sit
here
longer
first
or
go
another
day
have
you
touched
cried
philippe
mother
rising
from
the
chair
i
must
go
at
once
at
once
but
even
as
she
tried
to
cross
the
room
she
leant
heavily
upon
the
table
and
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
get
me
water
elsie
she
said
and
threw
up
her
veil
her
ruined
face
was
grey
even
at
the
lips
her
eyes
were
caverns
worn
by
the
dropping
of
water
her
mouth
was
folded
tightly
that
nothing
kind
or
hopeful
or
happy
might
come
out
of
it
again
elsie
ran
to
the
unfortunately
she
seized
the
glass
with
the
golden
scrolling
and
when
she
held
it
to
the
lips
of
her
mistress
those
lips
refused
it
too
that
glass
of
mine
elsie
i
wish
this
woman
gone
why
do
you
get
up
where
are
your
clothes
why
do
you
dress
and
go
madame
hush
hush
you
are
ah
dragging
herself
weakly
to
the
door
i
must
take
an
inventory
that
is
what
i
should
have
done
before
if
i
do
make
a
list
at
once
i
shall
lose
something
take
an
inventory
exclaimed
the
mockingly
as
she
followed
her
the
house
wo
change
after
four
years
it
is
now
that
it
will
change
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
at
fanny
do
worry
about
the
room
mademoiselle
she
is
like
that
a
des
she
can
not
possibly
sleep
here
keep
the
room
for
a
day
or
two
till
you
find
another
in
a
very
few
days
i
shall
be
going
to
england
keep
it
a
week
if
necessary
she
will
be
persuaded
when
she
is
calmer
why
did
they
let
her
come
when
they
wrote
me
that
she
was
a
dying
woman
but
no
est
comme
toujours
méchante
pour
tout
le
you
told
me
she
thought
only
of
philippe
ah
mademoiselle
she
is
like
many
of
us
she
has
still
her
sense
of
property
chapter
xx
the
last
day
around
the
spanish
square
the
first
had
been
put
up
in
the
night
awnings
red
and
yellow
flapping
in
the
mountain
wind
in
the
shops
under
the
arches
in
the
market
in
the
centre
of
the
square
they
were
selling
anemones
but
have
you
any
eggs
no
eggs
this
morning
any
butter
none
there
has
been
none
these
three
days
a
pot
of
condensed
milk
mademoiselle
the
train
did
not
bring
any
must
i
eat
anemones
give
me
two
bunches
and
round
the
spanish
square
the
orange
awnings
protecting
the
empty
shuddered
and
flapped
like
a
gay
hat
worn
unsteadily
when
the
stomach
is
empty
what
was
there
to
do
on
a
last
day
but
look
and
note
and
watch
and
take
one
leave
the
buds
against
the
sky
were
larger
than
ever
the
day
after
it
would
be
spring
in
england
too
mademoiselle
said
the
market
woman
there
is
a
little
ounce
of
butter
here
that
you
may
have
the
morning
passed
and
on
drifted
the
day
and
all
was
finished
all
was
done
and
love
gone
too
and
with
love
gone
the
less
divine
but
wider
world
lay
open
in
the
silver
lion
the
patient
girl
behind
the
counter
shook
her
head
there
is
no
letter
for
you
and
i
leave
for
england
if
a
letter
comes
where
shall
i
send
it
on
thank
you
but
there
will
come
no
letter
now
it
was
the
afternoon
now
such
a
tea
a
happy
lonely
tea
the
last
the
best
in
charleville
crossing
the
road
from
the
silver
lion
fanny
bought
a
round
flat
sandwich
cake
and
carried
it
to
the
house
which
was
her
own
for
one
more
night
placed
it
in
state
upon
the
biggest
of
the
green
and
gold
porcelain
plates
and
the
anemones
in
a
beside
it
she
lit
the
fire
made
tea
and
knelt
upon
the
floor
to
toast
her
bread
there
was
a
hurry
in
her
actions
so
long
as
nobody
comes
she
whispered
so
long
as
i
am
left
alone
she
feared
the
of
the
the
threatened
inventory
of
philippe
mother
a
call
of
state
farewell
from
the
billeting
lieutenant
when
the
toast
was
done
and
the
tea
made
some
whim
led
her
to
change
her
tunic
for
a
white
jersey
newly
back
from
the
wash
to
put
on
the
old
dancing
shoes
of
metz
and
not
until
her
hair
was
carefully
brushed
to
match
this
gaiety
did
she
draw
up
the
armchair
with
the
broken
leg
and
prop
it
steadily
beside
the
but
who
was
that
knocking
on
the
door
in
the
street
one
of
the
section
coming
on
a
message
the
to
tell
her
that
she
had
some
last
duty
still
shall
i
go
to
the
window
creeping
nearer
to
it
then
with
a
glance
back
at
the
no
let
them
knock
but
how
they
knocked
persistent
gentle
could
one
sit
peacefully
at
tea
so
called
and
so
besought
she
went
up
to
the
blue
curtains
and
standing
saw
the
brooding
in
the
sunlight
of
her
is
there
said
a
light
voice
in
the
hidden
street
below
and
at
that
she
peered
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
the
stonework
and
saw
a
pale
young
man
in
grey
before
the
door
she
watched
him
she
watched
him
gravely
for
he
had
come
too
late
but
tenderly
for
she
had
been
in
love
with
him
the
raised
her
two
black
brows
in
her
expressive
face
and
looked
upwards
her
look
said
why
do
you
let
him
in
yet
fanny
stood
inactive
her
hands
resting
on
the
stone
julien
is
here
is
here
and
does
not
know
that
i
go
but
she
put
from
her
and
in
the
stillness
she
felt
her
spirit
smiling
for
pleasure
in
him
she
had
mourned
him
once
she
never
would
again
in
her
pocket
lay
the
key
of
the
street
door
and
the
long
rotted
and
useless
dangled
at
her
cheek
with
a
quick
wrench
she
brought
its
length
tumbling
beside
her
on
the
sill
then
knotted
it
to
the
key
and
let
it
down
into
the
street
the
young
man
saw
it
hang
before
his
eyes
are
you
coming
in
said
a
voice
above
him
tea
is
ready
fanny
it
has
been
ready
for
six
weeks
only
wait
he
was
trying
the
key
in
the
door
what
still
longer
said
the
voice
he
was
gone
from
the
pavement
he
had
entered
her
house
he
was
on
her
stair
the
grey
ghost
of
the
soldier
she
had
a
minute
grace
slipping
her
hand
into
the
cupboard
she
drew
out
another
cup
and
saucer
and
laid
the
table
for
two
there
was
his
face
his
hands
at
her
door
but
what
a
foreign
grey
body
come
in
ghost
she
said
and
held
out
her
hands
for
now
she
cared
at
least
for
he
who
cared
lest
that
too
be
lost
does
a
ghost
kiss
yes
sometimes
sometimes
they
are
ghosts
who
kiss
oh
fanny
then
with
a
quick
glance
at
the
table
you
are
expecting
someone
you
how
late
you
come
to
tea
with
me
but
i
you
did
know
i
waited
tea
for
you
she
said
and
turning
to
a
calendar
upon
a
wooden
wheel
she
rolled
it
back
a
month
she
made
him
sit
she
made
him
drink
and
eat
he
filled
the
room
with
his
gaiety
he
had
no
reasons
upon
his
tongue
and
no
excuses
she
no
reproaches
no
farewell
a
glance
round
the
room
had
shown
her
that
there
were
no
signs
of
her
packing
her
heavy
kitbag
was
at
the
station
her
suitcase
packed
and
in
the
cupboard
she
put
her
gravest
news
away
till
later
you
came
by
the
new
train
that
has
arrived
at
last
in
charleville
yes
and
i
go
up
to
revins
she
paused
at
that
but
how
i
do
know
he
answered
smiling
at
her
her
eyes
sparkled
could
i
she
had
that
morning
delivered
the
car
to
its
new
driver
of
course
i
could
i
will
i
will
i
manage
you
counted
on
me
to
drive
you
to
revins
will
it
be
difficult
to
manage
no
o
but
i
must
get
the
car
out
before
dark
or
there
will
be
no
excuse
she
pushed
back
her
chair
and
went
to
the
window
the
sun
was
sinking
over
the
mountains
and
the
scenery
in
the
western
sky
was
reflected
in
the
fiery
pools
between
the
cobbles
in
the
street
i
must
go
soon
and
get
it
but
how
she
paused
and
thought
how
do
you
come
down
i
do
i
go
on
to
brussels
there
is
a
car
at
revins
belonging
to
my
agent
he
will
take
me
to
dinant
for
the
brussels
train
you
are
bound
for
brussels
yet
you
could
have
gone
straight
from
paris
to
brussels
yet
i
did
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
she
took
down
her
cap
and
coat
from
the
nail
on
which
they
were
hanging
need
you
go
yet
he
said
withdrawing
the
clothes
from
her
arm
and
laying
them
upon
a
chair
she
sat
down
again
the
sun
is
sinking
the
town
gets
dark
so
quickly
here
though
light
enough
in
the
mountains
if
i
leave
it
later
the
men
will
be
gone
home
and
the
garage
key
with
them
you
right
he
said
put
them
on
and
he
held
the
coat
for
her
but
once
you
have
the
car
there
no
hurry
over
our
drive
yes
fetch
it
quickly
and
then
we
go
up
above
revins
and
i
show
you
the
things
i
have
in
mind
what
things
he
drew
out
a
fat
red
and
held
it
up
it
full
of
my
thoughts
he
said
quick
with
the
car
and
we
get
up
there
while
it
light
enough
to
show
you
she
slipped
out
under
the
sky
through
the
streets
where
the
shadows
of
the
houses
lay
black
as
lacquer
before
the
locked
gates
of
the
garage
the
lounged
smoking
his
little
dry
cigarettes
we
are
on
fire
he
said
pointing
up
the
street
at
the
mountain
what
an
evening
yes
and
my
last
she
said
oh
may
i
have
the
key
of
the
garage
but
you
given
up
the
car
yes
i
have
but
after
i
shall
never
use
your
petrol
again
and
there
are
my
bags
to
be
taken
to
the
station
ah
let
me
have
the
key
he
gave
her
the
key
do
be
long
then
yet
i
shall
be
gone
in
a
few
minutes
when
you
come
in
hang
the
key
on
the
nail
in
the
office
once
more
she
wound
up
the
renault
drove
from
the
garage
regained
the
rue
de
clèves
and
saw
julien
leaning
from
her
window
sill
come
down
come
down
she
called
up
to
him
and
realised
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
made
her
revelation
to
him
before
they
started
on
this
journey
for
now
he
was
staring
at
the
mountains
in
an
absorbed
excited
fashion
and
she
would
have
to
check
his
flow
of
spirits
spoil
their
companionable
gaiety
and
precipitate
such
heavy
thoughts
upon
him
as
might
she
guessed
spread
to
herself
between
his
disappearance
from
the
window
and
the
opening
of
the
street
door
she
had
a
second
in
which
to
fight
with
her
disinclination
and
yet
if
i
neglected
to
tell
him
in
the
room
she
argued
i
ca
tell
him
in
the
street
for
looking
up
she
saw
as
she
expected
the
deep
eyes
of
the
watching
her
as
impersonally
as
the
mountains
watched
the
town
there
come
a
moment
she
said
to
herself
as
the
street
door
opened
and
he
joined
her
and
climbed
into
the
car
when
it
come
of
itself
when
it
will
be
easy
and
natural
by
back
streets
they
left
the
town
and
soon
upon
the
step
road
had
climbed
through
the
belt
of
trees
and
out
on
to
bare
slopes
as
they
wound
up
the
mountain
sitting
so
dose
together
she
felt
how
familiar
his
company
was
to
her
and
how
familiar
his
silence
their
thoughts
running
together
would
meet
presently
as
they
had
often
met
at
the
juncture
when
his
hand
was
laid
upon
hers
at
the
wheel
but
when
he
spoke
he
startled
her
how
long
has
the
railway
been
extended
to
charleville
a
fortnight
she
answered
upon
reflection
how
about
the
big
stone
bridge
on
this
side
the
railway
bridge
why
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
as
usual
and
have
they
replaced
it
yet
by
a
wooden
one
no
not
yet
and
no
one
is
even
working
there
i
have
been
there
lately
she
answered
maybe
they
are
by
now
is
it
your
railway
to
revin
you
are
thinking
of
he
was
fingering
his
big
note
book
i
ca
start
anything
till
the
railway
runs
he
answered
tapping
on
the
book
but
when
it
runs
i
show
you
when
we
get
up
there
they
came
to
a
quagmire
in
the
red
clay
of
the
road
it
was
an
ancient
trap
left
over
from
the
rains
of
winter
strewn
with
twigs
and
small
branches
so
that
light
wheels
might
skim
with
luck
over
its
shaking
holes
you
see
he
said
pursuing
his
thought
lorries
would
do
here
they
sink
they
would
she
agreed
and
found
that
his
innocence
of
her
secret
locked
her
words
more
tightly
in
her
throat
far
above
from
an
iron
peak
the
light
of
the
heavy
sun
was
slipping
beneath
it
they
ran
in
shadow
through
rock
and
moss
before
the
light
had
gone
they
had
reached
the
first
crest
and
drew
up
for
a
moment
at
a
movement
of
his
hand
looking
back
to
charleville
he
said
see
where
the
river
winds
the
railway
crosses
it
three
times
can
we
see
from
here
if
the
bridges
are
all
down
and
he
stood
up
and
steadying
himself
upon
her
shoulder
peered
down
at
charleville
to
where
man
lived
in
the
valleys
but
though
the
slopes
ahead
of
them
were
still
alight
depths
distance
the
crowding
and
thickening
of
twilight
in
the
hollows
behind
them
offered
no
detail
i
fear
they
are
she
said
gazing
with
him
i
think
they
are
i
think
i
can
remember
that
they
are
soon
they
would
be
at
the
top
of
the
long
descent
on
revins
should
she
tell
him
he
who
sat
so
close
so
unsuspecting
an
arrowy
temptation
shot
through
her
mind
is
it
possible
why
not
write
a
letter
when
he
is
gone
she
saw
its
beauty
its
advantages
and
she
played
with
it
like
someone
who
knew
where
to
find
strength
to
withstand
it
he
is
so
happy
so
gay
urged
the
voice
so
full
of
his
plans
and
you
have
left
it
so
late
how
painful
now
just
as
he
is
going
to
bid
him
think
will
never
see
her
face
again
how
close
he
sat
beside
her
how
close
her
secret
sat
within
her
think
how
it
is
with
you
pursued
the
tempting
voice
it
is
hard
to
part
from
a
face
but
not
so
hard
to
part
from
the
writer
of
a
letter
over
the
next
crest
the
belgian
ardennes
showed
blue
and
dim
in
the
distance
stop
he
said
holding
up
his
hand
again
they
were
on
the
top
of
a
high
plateau
she
drew
up
a
large
bird
with
red
under
its
wings
flapped
out
and
hung
in
the
air
over
the
precipice
see
the
meuse
he
said
see
on
its
banks
do
you
see
down
there
come
to
the
edge
hundreds
of
feet
below
lay
a
of
dark
unstirring
water
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
rock
looking
down
together
she
saw
he
was
excited
his
usually
pale
face
was
flushed
do
you
see
down
there
do
you
see
in
this
light
a
village
she
could
see
well
enough
a
village
that
revins
and
those
dark
dots
beyond
i
see
them
my
factories
before
the
summer
you
see
smoke
down
there
they
are
partially
destroyed
one
ca
see
well
one
ca
see
how
much
julien
yes
have
you
never
been
back
have
you
never
seen
what
happened
she
had
not
guessed
this
she
was
not
prepared
for
this
this
was
the
secret
then
of
his
absorption
i
not
seen
it
yet
i
not
been
able
to
get
away
and
the
paris
factories
have
held
me
every
minute
but
now
i
here
i
wondering
you
see
that
dot
beyond
standing
separate
yes
that
where
i
sleep
that
the
house
but
can
you
sleep
there
she
asked
still
shocked
that
she
had
not
realised
what
this
journey
was
to
him
can
i
i
mean
is
the
house
ruined
oh
the
house
is
in
bad
order
he
said
not
ruined
my
old
writes
she
was
my
nurse
a
hundred
years
ago
she
has
been
there
through
the
occupation
i
wrote
to
her
and
she
expects
me
it
will
be
too
dark
but
before
i
leave
i
shall
see
what
they
have
done
to
the
factories
do
you
know
at
all
how
bad
they
are
i
had
letters
the
agent
went
on
ahead
five
days
ago
and
he
has
settled
there
already
but
letters
do
tell
one
enough
there
are
little
things
in
the
factories
things
i
put
in
myself
he
broke
off
and
drew
her
to
another
side
of
the
plateau
see
down
there
that
unfortunate
railway
crosses
two
more
bridges
i
ca
see
now
but
they
blown
up
since
all
the
others
are
and
such
a
time
for
business
it
hurts
me
to
think
of
the
things
i
ca
set
going
till
that
railway
works
every
one
is
crying
out
for
the
things
that
i
can
make
here
on
and
on
he
talked
in
his
excitement
absorbed
and
planning
leading
her
from
one
point
of
view
on
the
plateau
to
another
her
eyes
followed
his
pointing
hands
from
crest
to
crest
of
the
mountains
their
neighbours
till
the
valleys
were
full
of
creeping
shadows
even
when
the
shades
filmed
his
eager
hand
he
held
it
out
to
point
here
and
there
as
though
the
whole
landscape
of
the
mountains
was
printed
in
immortal
daylight
on
his
mind
i
ca
see
she
said
it
so
dark
down
there
i
ca
see
it
as
he
pointed
to
the
spot
where
the
brussels
railway
once
ran
well
it
there
he
said
staring
at
the
spot
with
eyes
that
knew
the
blue
night
deepened
in
the
sky
from
east
west
north
south
sprang
the
stars
fanny
look
there
a
light
in
my
house
fathoms
of
shade
piled
over
the
village
and
in
the
heart
of
it
a
light
had
appeared
marie
has
lit
the
lamp
on
the
steps
i
must
be
too
late
for
her
i
must
soon
go
down
what
you
walk
is
there
a
footpath
down
i
shall
go
down
this
mountain
path
below
it
a
path
i
know
shooting
hares
soon
i
shall
be
back
again
brussels
one
week
then
paris
then
here
again
i
see
what
builders
can
be
spared
from
the
paris
factories
they
can
walk
out
here
from
charleville
ten
miles
nothing
then
we
get
the
stone
cut
ready
in
the
quarries
do
you
know
during
the
war
i
thought
when
i
thought
of
it
the
revins
factories
are
destroyed
it
wo
be
i
who
start
them
again
i
take
up
that
hard
mountain
life
any
more
if
they
destroyed
it
too
discouraging
so
let
them
lie
but
now
i
do
feel
discouraged
at
all
i
new
ideas
bigger
ones
i
older
i
going
to
be
richer
and
then
since
they
partly
knocked
down
i
rebuild
them
in
a
better
way
and
it
not
only
that
see
he
was
carried
away
by
his
resolves
shaken
by
excitement
and
pulling
out
his
he
tilted
it
this
way
and
that
under
the
starlight
but
he
could
not
read
it
and
all
the
stars
in
that
sky
were
no
use
to
him
he
struck
a
match
and
held
the
feeble
flame
under
that
heavenly
magnificence
and
a
puff
of
wind
blew
it
out
but
i
do
need
to
see
he
exclaimed
and
pointing
into
the
night
he
continued
to
unfold
his
plans
to
build
in
the
unmeaning
darkness
which
to
his
eyes
was
mountain
valleys
where
new
factories
arose
mountain
slopes
whose
sides
were
to
be
quarried
for
their
stony
ribs
rivers
to
move
railways
to
paris
and
to
brussels
as
she
followed
his
finger
her
eyes
lit
upon
the
stars
instead
and
now
he
said
there
there
pointing
to
orion
and
now
here
here
lighting
upon
aldebrande
as
she
followed
his
finger
her
thoughts
were
on
their
own
paths
thinking
this
is
julien
as
he
will
be
not
as
i
have
known
him
the
soldier
had
been
a
wanderer
like
herself
a
being
but
here
beside
her
in
the
darkness
stood
the
civilian
the
the
solid
man
the
builder
plotting
to
capture
the
future
for
him
too
she
could
no
longer
remain
as
she
had
been
here
below
her
was
the
face
the
mountain
face
of
her
rival
unless
she
became
one
with
his
plans
and
lived
in
the
same
blazing
light
with
them
she
would
be
a
separate
landscape
a
strain
upon
his
focus
then
she
saw
him
looking
at
her
her
face
in
the
starlight
was
as
unreadable
as
his
own
are
you
sure
he
was
saying
that
you
wo
be
blamed
about
the
car
sure
quite
sure
the
men
have
all
gone
home
but
morning
when
they
see
it
has
been
out
not
morning
no
they
wo
say
anything
morning
oh
dear
julien
yes
i
think
i
hope
you
are
going
to
have
a
great
success
here
and
forget
me
when
you
when
i
come
back
in
a
week
but
your
weeks
are
so
long
yet
you
will
be
happy
without
me
he
said
suddenly
what
makes
you
say
that
you
some
solace
some
treasure
of
your
own
he
nodded
in
a
way
he
said
i
sometimes
thought
you
half
out
of
reach
of
pain
she
caught
her
breath
and
the
starry
sky
whirled
over
her
head
you
a
happy
foreigner
he
finished
did
you
know
dormans
called
you
that
after
the
first
dance
he
said
to
me
wonder
if
they
are
all
so
happy
in
england
i
must
go
and
see
you
too
you
too
she
said
eagerly
and
she
wanted
him
to
admit
it
see
how
happy
how
busy
how
full
of
the
affairs
of
life
you
soon
will
be
difficulties
of
every
sort
and
hard
work
and
triumph
and
you
see
you
see
i
do
it
he
said
catching
fire
again
i
grow
rich
on
these
bony
mountains
it
is
only
the
riches
mind
you
but
they
are
the
proof
i
wring
it
out
in
triumph
not
in
water
but
in
gold
from
the
rock
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
path
a
little
above
her
blotting
out
the
sky
with
his
darker
shape
then
turning
kissed
her
for
the
little
time
he
said
and
disappeared
the
noise
of
his
footsteps
descended
in
the
night
below
ten
minutes
passed
and
as
each
step
trod
innocently
away
from
her
for
ever
she
continued
motionless
and
silent
to
listen
from
her
rock
the
noises
all
but
faded
yet
loth
to
put
an
end
to
the
soft
rustle
she
listened
while
it
grew
fainter
and
less
human
to
her
ear
till
it
mingled
at
last
with
the
rustle
of
nature
with
the
whine
of
the
wind
and
the
of
a
little
creature
close
at
hand
she
stirred
at
last
and
turned
and
found
herself
alone
with
that
flock
of
enormous
companions
the
mountains
like
cattle
feeding
about
her
above
uniting
craggy
horn
to
horn
was
an
architrave
of
stars
to
the
light
in
the
valley
and
starting
the
car
she
began
the
descent
on
charleville
there
are
moments
when
the
roll
of
the
world
is
perceptible
to
the
extravagant
senses
there
are
moments
when
the
glamour
of
man
thins
away
into
oblivion
before
the
magic
of
night
when
his
face
fades
and
his
voice
is
silenced
before
that
wind
of
excited
perception
that
blows
out
of
nowhere
to
shake
the
soul
in
such
a
mood
in
such
a
giddy
hour
seated
in
person
upon
her
car
in
spirit
upon
her
imagination
fanny
rode
down
the
mountain
into
the
night
she
was
invincible
inattentive
to
the
voice
of
absent
man
a
hard
hollow
goddess
a
flute
for
the
piping
of
heaven
composing
and
chanting
unmusical
songs
her
inner
ear
fastened
upon
another
melody
and
heaven
protecting
a
creature
at
that
moment
so
estranged
from
earth
led
her
down
the
wild
road
held
back
the
threatening
forest
branches
brought
her
all
but
standing
up
at
the
wheel
like
a
lunatic
safely
to
the
foot
of
the
last
hill
recalled
to
earth
by
the
light
of
charleville
she
drove
slowly
up
the
main
street
replaced
the
car
in
the
garage
and
returned
to
her
house
in
the
rue
de
clèves
it
is
true
she
whispered
as
she
entered
the
room
that
i
am
half
out
of
reach
of
pain
and
long
in
plans
for
the
future
she
hung
over
the
embers
the
gradual
sinking
of
the
light
before
her
reminded
her
of
the
present
the
last
night
that
the
fire
burns
for
me
she
heaped
on
all
her
logs
little
pannikin
of
chocolate
little
companion
hunger
too
awoke
and
she
dropped
two
sticks
of
chocolate
into
the
water
the
fire
dies
down
i
shall
be
gone
a
petal
from
the
apple
blossom
on
the
mantelpiece
fell
against
her
hand
i
shall
be
gone
the
apple
blossom
is
spread
to
large
wax
flowers
and
the
flowers
will
fall
and
never
breed
apples
they
will
sweep
this
room
and
philippe
mother
will
come
and
sit
in
it
and
make
it
sad
so
many
things
happen
in
the
evening
so
many
unripe
thoughts
ripen
before
the
fire
turk
bulgar
german
me
never
to
return
when
she
comes
into
this
room
the
apple
flowers
will
stare
at
her
across
the
desert
of
absence
and
wonder
who
is
i
wonder
if
i
can
teach
her
anything
will
she
keep
the
grid
on
the
wood
fire
and
the
blue
birds
flying
on
the
bed
it
is
like
going
out
of
life
tenderly
leaving
one
little
arrangements
to
the
next
comer
and
drawing
her
chair
up
to
the
table
she
lit
the
lamp
and
sat
down
to
write
her
letter
the
end
