chapter
i
his
mate
lady
was
as
much
a
part
of
lad
everyday
happiness
as
the
sunshine
itself
she
seemed
to
him
quite
as
perfect
and
as
gloriously
indispensable
he
could
no
more
have
imagined
a
ladyless
life
than
a
sunless
life
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
suspect
that
lady
could
be
any
less
devoted
than
he
until
knave
came
to
the
place
lad
was
an
collie
thoroughbred
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
blood
he
had
the
benign
dignity
that
was
a
heritage
from
endless
generations
of
ancestors
he
had
too
the
gay
courage
of
a
and
an
uncanny
wisdom
also
who
could
doubt
it
after
a
look
into
his
mournful
brown
eyes
he
had
a
soul
his
shaggy
coat
set
off
by
the
snowy
ruff
and
chest
was
like
mahogany
his
absurdly
tiny
forepaws
in
which
he
took
inordinate
pride
were
silver
white
three
years
earlier
when
lad
was
in
his
first
prime
before
the
mighty
chest
and
shoulders
had
filled
out
and
the
tawny
coat
had
waxed
so
shaggy
lady
had
been
brought
to
the
place
she
had
been
brought
in
the
master
overcoat
pocket
rolled
up
into
a
fuzzy
ball
of
softness
no
bigger
than
a
kitten
the
master
had
fished
the
puppy
out
of
the
cavern
of
his
pocket
and
set
her
down
asprawl
and
shivering
and
squealing
on
the
veranda
floor
lad
had
walked
cautiously
across
the
veranda
sniffed
inquiry
at
the
blinking
pigmy
who
gallantly
essayed
to
growl
defiance
up
at
the
huge
welcomer
and
from
that
first
moment
he
had
taken
her
under
his
protection
first
it
had
been
the
natural
impulse
of
the
thoroughbred
brute
or
human
to
guard
the
helpless
then
as
the
shapeless
yellow
baby
grew
into
a
slenderly
graceful
collie
his
guardianship
changed
to
stark
adoration
he
was
lady
life
slave
and
she
bullied
him
unmercifully
bossed
the
gentle
giant
in
a
shameful
manner
crowding
him
from
the
warmest
spot
by
the
fire
brazenly
yet
daintily
snatching
from
between
his
jaws
the
choicest
bone
of
their
joint
dinner
hectoring
her
dignified
victim
into
in
hot
weather
when
he
would
far
rather
have
drowsed
under
the
lakeside
trees
her
vagaries
her
teasing
her
occasional
little
flurries
of
temper
were
borne
by
lad
not
meekly
but
joyously
all
she
did
was
in
his
eyes
perfect
and
lady
graciously
allowed
herself
to
be
idolized
for
she
was
marvelously
human
in
some
ways
lad
a
thoroughbred
descended
from
a
hundred
generations
of
thoroughbreds
was
less
human
and
more
disinterested
life
at
the
place
was
wondrous
pleasant
for
both
the
dogs
there
were
thick
woods
to
roam
in
side
by
side
there
were
squirrels
to
chase
and
rabbits
to
trail
yes
and
if
the
squirrels
had
played
fair
and
had
not
resorted
to
unsportsmanly
tactics
by
climbing
trees
when
close
pressed
there
would
doubtless
have
been
squirrels
to
catch
as
well
as
to
chase
as
for
the
rabbits
they
were
easier
to
overtake
and
lady
got
the
lion
share
of
all
such
morsels
there
was
the
lake
to
plunge
into
for
a
swim
or
a
wallow
after
a
run
in
the
dust
and
july
heat
there
was
a
deliciously
comfortable
old
rug
in
front
of
the
open
fire
whereon
to
lie
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
nights
when
the
wind
screamed
through
bare
trees
and
the
snow
scratched
hungrily
at
the
panes
best
of
all
to
them
both
there
were
the
master
and
the
mistress
especially
the
mistress
any
man
with
money
to
make
the
purchase
may
become
a
dog
but
no
man
spend
he
ever
so
much
coin
and
food
and
tact
in
the
effort
may
become
a
dog
without
the
consent
of
the
dog
do
you
get
the
difference
and
he
whom
a
dog
once
unreservedly
accepts
as
master
is
forever
that
dog
god
to
both
lad
and
lady
from
the
first
the
man
who
bought
them
was
not
the
mere
owner
but
the
absolute
master
to
them
he
was
the
unquestioned
lord
of
life
and
death
the
hearer
and
answerer
the
eternal
law
his
the
voice
that
must
be
obeyed
whatever
the
command
from
earliest
puppyhood
both
lad
and
lady
had
been
brought
up
within
the
law
as
far
back
as
they
could
remember
they
had
known
and
obeyed
the
place
simple
code
for
example
all
animals
of
the
woods
might
lawfully
be
chased
but
the
mistress
prize
chickens
and
the
other
little
folk
of
the
place
must
be
ignored
no
matter
how
hungry
or
how
playful
a
collie
might
chance
to
be
a
human
walking
openly
or
riding
down
the
drive
into
the
place
by
daylight
must
not
be
barked
at
except
by
way
of
friendly
announcement
but
anyone
entering
the
grounds
from
other
ingress
than
the
drive
or
anyone
walking
furtively
or
with
a
tramp
slouch
must
be
attacked
at
sight
also
the
interior
of
the
house
was
sacrosanct
it
was
a
place
for
perfect
behavior
no
rug
must
be
scratched
nothing
gnawed
or
played
with
in
fact
lady
one
whipping
had
followed
a
effort
of
hers
to
worry
the
huge
stuffed
bald
eagle
that
stood
on
a
stump
in
the
master
study
just
off
the
big
where
the
fireplace
was
that
eagle
shot
by
himself
as
it
raided
the
flock
of
prize
chickens
was
the
delight
of
the
master
heart
and
at
lady
attempt
on
it
he
had
taught
her
a
lesson
that
made
her
cringe
for
weeks
thereafter
at
bare
sight
of
the
to
this
day
she
would
never
walk
past
the
eagle
without
making
the
widest
possible
detour
around
it
but
that
punishment
had
been
suffered
while
she
was
still
in
the
idiotic
days
of
puppyhood
after
she
was
grown
lady
would
no
more
have
thought
of
tampering
with
the
eagle
or
with
anything
else
in
the
house
than
it
would
occur
to
a
human
to
stand
on
his
head
in
church
then
early
one
spring
came
knave
a
showy
magnificent
collie
of
coat
save
for
a
black
saddle
and
with
alert
topaz
eyes
knave
did
not
belong
to
the
master
but
to
a
man
who
going
to
europe
for
a
month
asked
him
to
care
for
the
dog
in
his
absence
the
master
glad
to
have
so
beautiful
an
ornament
to
the
place
had
willingly
consented
he
was
rewarded
when
on
the
train
from
town
an
admiring
crowd
of
commuters
flocked
to
the
to
stare
at
the
collie
the
only
dissenting
note
in
the
was
the
grouchy
old
maybe
he
a
thoroughbred
like
you
say
drawled
the
old
fellow
to
the
master
but
i
never
yet
saw
a
dog
give
to
knave
showed
his
scorn
for
such
silly
criticism
by
a
cavernous
yawn
thoroughbred
grunted
the
with
them
streaks
of
on
the
roof
of
his
mouth
ever
see
a
thoroughbred
that
did
have
a
black
but
the
old
man
slighting
words
were
ignored
with
disdain
by
the
crowd
of
volunteer
in
the
in
time
the
master
alighted
at
his
station
with
knave
straining
joyously
at
the
leash
as
the
master
reached
the
place
and
turned
into
the
drive
both
lad
and
lady
at
sound
of
his
footsteps
came
tearing
around
the
side
of
the
house
to
greet
him
on
simultaneous
sight
and
scent
of
the
strange
dog
frisking
along
at
his
side
the
two
collies
paused
in
their
madly
joyous
onrush
up
went
their
ruffs
down
went
their
heads
lady
flashed
forward
to
do
battle
with
the
stranger
who
was
monopolizing
so
much
of
the
master
attention
knave
not
at
all
averse
to
battle
especially
with
a
smaller
dog
braced
himself
and
then
moved
forward
fangs
bare
but
of
a
sudden
his
head
went
up
his
brush
broke
into
swift
wagging
his
lips
curled
down
he
had
recognized
that
his
prospective
foe
was
not
of
his
own
sex
and
nowhere
except
among
humans
does
a
male
or
even
defend
himself
against
the
female
of
his
species
lady
noting
the
stranger
sudden
friendliness
paused
irresolute
in
her
charge
and
at
that
instant
lad
darted
past
her
full
at
throat
he
launched
himself
the
master
rasped
out
down
lad
almost
in
midair
the
collie
arrested
his
onset
coming
to
earth
bristling
furious
and
yet
with
no
thought
but
to
obey
knave
seeing
his
foe
was
not
going
to
fight
turned
once
more
toward
lady
lad
ordered
the
master
pointing
toward
knave
and
speaking
with
quiet
intentness
let
him
alone
understand
let
him
and
lad
understood
even
as
years
of
training
and
centuries
of
ancestry
had
taught
him
to
understand
every
spoken
wish
of
the
master
he
must
give
up
his
impulse
to
make
war
on
this
intruder
whom
at
sight
he
hated
it
was
the
law
and
from
the
law
there
was
no
appeal
with
yearningly
helpless
rage
he
looked
on
while
the
newcomer
was
installed
on
the
place
with
a
wondering
sorrow
he
found
himself
forced
to
share
the
master
and
mistress
caresses
with
this
interloper
with
growing
pain
he
submitted
to
knave
gay
attentions
to
lady
and
to
lady
evident
relish
of
the
guest
companionship
gone
were
the
peaceful
old
days
of
utter
contentment
lady
had
always
regarded
lad
as
her
own
special
property
to
tease
and
to
boss
and
to
despoil
of
choice
but
her
attitude
toward
knave
was
far
different
she
coquetted
with
the
dog
at
one
moment
affecting
to
scorn
him
at
another
meeting
his
advances
with
a
delighted
friendliness
she
never
presumed
to
boss
him
as
she
had
always
bossed
lad
he
fascinated
her
without
seeming
to
follow
him
about
she
was
forever
at
his
heels
lad
cut
to
the
heart
at
her
sudden
indifference
toward
his
loyal
self
tried
in
every
way
his
simple
soul
could
devise
to
win
back
her
interest
he
essayed
clumsily
to
romp
with
her
as
the
lithely
graceful
knave
romped
to
drive
rabbits
for
her
on
their
woodland
rambles
to
thrust
himself
in
a
dozen
gentle
ways
upon
her
attention
but
it
was
no
use
lady
scarcely
noticed
him
when
his
overtures
of
friendship
chanced
to
annoy
her
she
rewarded
them
with
a
snap
or
with
an
impatient
growl
and
ever
she
turned
to
the
knave
in
a
keenness
of
attraction
that
was
all
but
hypnotic
as
his
divinity
total
loss
of
interest
in
himself
grew
too
apparent
to
be
doubted
lad
big
heart
broke
being
only
a
dog
and
a
in
thought
he
did
not
realize
that
knave
newness
and
his
difference
from
anything
she
had
known
formed
a
large
part
of
lady
desire
for
the
visitor
favor
nor
did
he
understand
that
such
interest
must
wane
when
the
novelty
should
wear
off
all
lad
knew
was
that
he
loved
her
and
that
for
the
sake
of
a
flashy
stranger
she
was
snubbing
him
as
the
law
forbade
him
to
avenge
himself
in
true
by
fighting
for
his
lady
love
lad
sadly
withdrew
from
the
unequal
contest
too
proud
to
compete
for
a
fickle
sweetheart
no
longer
did
he
try
to
join
in
the
others
but
lay
at
a
distance
his
splendid
head
between
his
snowy
little
forepaws
his
brown
eyes
sick
with
sorrow
watching
their
gambols
nor
did
he
thrust
his
undesired
presence
on
them
during
their
woodland
rambles
he
took
to
moping
solitary
infinitely
miserable
perhaps
there
is
on
earth
something
unhappier
than
a
bitterly
aggrieved
dog
but
no
one
has
ever
discovered
that
elusive
something
knave
from
the
first
had
shown
and
felt
for
lad
a
scornful
indifference
not
understanding
the
law
he
had
set
down
the
older
refusal
to
fight
as
a
sign
of
exemplary
if
timorous
prudence
and
he
looked
down
upon
him
accordingly
one
day
knave
came
home
from
the
morning
run
through
the
forest
without
lady
neither
the
calls
nor
the
blasts
of
his
could
bring
her
back
to
the
place
whereat
lad
arose
heavily
from
his
favorite
under
the
piano
and
cantered
off
to
the
woods
nor
did
he
return
several
hours
later
the
master
went
to
the
woods
to
investigate
followed
by
the
rollicking
knave
at
the
forest
edge
the
master
shouted
a
bark
from
lad
answered
and
the
master
made
his
way
through
underbrush
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
in
a
clearing
he
found
lady
her
left
forepaw
caught
in
the
steel
jaws
of
a
lad
was
standing
protectingly
above
her
stooping
now
and
then
to
lick
her
cruelly
pinched
foot
or
to
whine
consolation
to
her
then
snarling
in
fierce
hate
at
a
score
of
crows
that
flapped
hopefully
in
the
above
the
victim
the
master
set
lady
free
and
knave
frisked
forward
right
joyously
to
greet
his
released
inamorata
but
lady
was
in
no
condition
to
play
then
nor
for
many
a
day
thereafter
her
forefoot
was
so
lacerated
and
swollen
that
she
was
fain
to
hobble
awkwardly
on
three
legs
for
the
next
fortnight
it
was
on
one
pantingly
hot
august
morning
a
little
later
that
lady
limped
into
the
house
in
search
of
a
cool
spot
where
she
might
lie
and
lick
her
throbbing
forefoot
lad
was
lying
as
usual
under
the
piano
in
the
his
tail
thumped
shy
welcome
on
the
hardwood
floor
as
she
passed
but
she
would
not
stay
or
so
much
as
notice
him
on
she
limped
into
the
master
study
where
an
open
window
sent
a
faint
breeze
through
the
house
giving
the
stuffed
eagle
a
wide
berth
lady
hobbled
to
the
window
and
made
as
though
to
lie
down
just
beneath
it
as
she
did
so
two
things
happened
she
leaned
too
much
weight
on
the
sore
foot
and
the
pressure
wrung
from
her
an
involuntary
yelp
of
pain
at
the
same
moment
a
crosscurrent
of
air
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
swept
through
the
and
blew
shut
the
door
of
the
adjoining
study
lady
was
a
prisoner
ordinarily
this
would
have
caused
her
no
for
the
open
window
was
only
thirty
inches
above
the
floor
and
the
drop
to
the
veranda
outside
was
a
bare
three
feet
it
would
have
been
the
simplest
matter
in
the
world
for
her
to
jump
out
had
she
wearied
of
her
chance
captivity
but
to
undertake
the
jump
with
the
prospect
of
landing
her
full
weight
and
impetus
on
a
forepaw
that
was
horribly
sensitive
to
the
lightest
touch
this
was
an
exploit
beyond
the
sufferer
so
lady
resigned
herself
to
imprisonment
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
floor
as
far
as
possible
from
the
eagle
moaned
softly
and
lay
still
at
sound
of
her
first
yelp
lad
had
run
forward
whining
eager
sympathy
but
the
closed
door
blocked
his
way
he
crouched
wretched
and
anxious
before
it
helpless
to
go
to
his
loved
one
assistance
knave
too
loping
back
from
a
solitary
prowl
of
the
woods
seeking
lady
heard
the
yelp
his
located
the
sound
at
once
along
the
veranda
he
trotted
to
the
open
study
window
with
a
bound
he
had
cleared
the
sill
and
alighted
inside
the
room
it
chanced
to
be
his
first
visit
to
the
study
the
door
was
usually
kept
shut
that
drafts
might
not
blow
the
master
about
and
knave
felt
at
best
little
interest
in
exploring
the
interior
of
houses
he
was
an
outdoor
dog
by
choice
he
advanced
now
toward
lady
his
tail
his
head
on
one
side
with
his
most
irresistible
air
then
as
he
came
forward
into
the
room
he
saw
the
eagle
he
halted
in
wonder
at
sight
of
the
enormous
bird
with
its
sweep
of
pinion
it
was
a
wholly
novel
spectacle
to
knave
and
he
greeted
it
with
a
gruff
bark
half
of
fear
half
of
bravado
quickly
however
his
sense
of
smell
told
him
this
apparition
was
no
living
thing
and
ashamed
of
his
momentary
cowardice
he
went
over
to
investigate
it
as
he
went
knave
cast
over
his
shoulder
a
look
of
invitation
to
lady
to
join
him
in
his
inspection
she
understood
the
invitation
but
memory
of
that
puppyhood
beating
made
her
recoil
from
accepting
it
knave
saw
her
shrink
back
and
he
realized
with
a
thrill
that
she
was
actually
afraid
of
this
lifeless
thing
which
could
harm
no
one
with
due
pride
in
showing
off
his
own
heroism
before
her
and
with
the
innate
craving
to
destroy
he
sprang
growling
upon
the
eagle
down
tumbled
the
stump
down
crashed
the
huge
stuffed
bird
with
it
knave
white
teeth
buried
deep
in
the
soft
feathers
of
its
breast
lady
at
this
sacrilege
whimpered
in
terror
but
her
plaint
served
only
to
increase
knave
zest
for
destruction
he
hurled
the
bird
to
the
floor
pinned
it
down
with
his
feet
and
at
one
jerk
tore
the
right
wing
from
the
body
coughing
out
the
mouthful
of
dusty
pinions
he
dug
his
teeth
into
the
eagle
throat
again
bracing
himself
with
his
forelegs
on
the
carcass
he
gave
a
sharp
tug
head
and
neck
came
away
in
his
mouth
and
then
before
he
could
drop
the
mouthful
and
return
to
the
work
of
demolition
he
heard
the
master
step
all
at
once
now
knave
proved
he
was
less
ignorant
of
the
law
or
at
least
of
its
penalties
than
might
have
been
supposed
from
his
act
of
vandalism
in
sudden
panic
he
bolted
for
the
window
the
silvery
head
of
the
eagle
still
unheeded
between
his
jaws
with
a
vaulting
spring
he
shot
out
through
the
open
casement
in
his
reckless
eagerness
to
escape
knocking
against
lady
injured
leg
as
he
passed
he
did
not
pause
at
lady
scream
of
pain
nor
did
he
stop
until
he
reached
the
crawling
under
this
he
deposited
the
incriminating
in
the
dark
recess
finding
no
pursuer
he
emerged
and
jogged
innocently
back
toward
the
veranda
the
master
entering
the
house
and
walking
across
the
toward
the
stairs
heard
lady
cry
he
looked
around
for
her
recognizing
from
the
sound
that
she
must
be
in
distress
his
eye
fell
on
lad
crouching
tense
and
eager
in
front
of
the
shut
study
door
the
master
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
study
at
the
first
step
inside
the
room
he
stopped
aghast
there
lay
the
chewed
and
battered
fragments
of
his
beloved
eagle
and
there
in
one
corner
frightened
with
guilt
writ
plain
all
over
her
cowered
lady
men
have
been
legally
done
to
death
on
far
lighter
evidence
than
encompassed
her
the
master
was
thunderstruck
for
more
than
two
years
lady
had
had
the
free
run
of
the
house
and
this
was
her
first
sin
at
that
a
sin
unworthy
any
dog
that
has
graduated
from
puppyhood
and
from
he
would
not
have
believed
it
he
not
have
believed
it
yet
here
was
the
hideous
evidence
scattered
all
over
the
floor
the
door
was
shut
but
the
window
stood
wide
through
the
window
doubtless
she
had
gotten
into
the
room
and
he
had
surprised
her
at
her
before
she
could
escape
by
the
same
opening
the
master
was
a
just
man
as
humans
go
but
this
was
a
crime
the
most
maudlin
could
not
have
condoned
the
eagle
moreover
had
been
the
pride
of
his
heart
as
perhaps
i
have
said
without
a
word
he
walked
to
the
wall
and
took
down
a
braided
from
long
disuse
lady
knew
what
was
coming
being
a
thoroughbred
she
did
not
try
to
run
nor
did
she
roll
for
mercy
she
cowered
moveless
nose
to
floor
awaiting
her
doom
back
swished
the
lash
down
it
came
whistling
as
a
man
whistles
whose
teeth
are
broken
across
lady
slender
flanks
it
smote
with
the
full
force
of
a
strong
lady
quivered
all
over
but
she
made
no
sound
she
who
would
whimper
at
a
chance
touch
to
her
sore
foot
was
mute
under
human
punishment
but
lad
was
not
mute
as
the
master
arm
swung
back
for
a
second
blow
he
heard
just
behind
a
low
throaty
growl
that
held
all
the
menace
of
ten
thousand
wordy
threats
he
wheeled
about
lad
was
close
at
his
heels
fangs
bared
eyes
red
head
lowered
tawny
body
taut
in
every
sinew
the
master
blinked
at
him
incredulous
here
was
something
infinitely
more
unbelievable
than
lady
supposed
destruction
of
the
eagle
the
impossible
had
come
to
pass
for
know
well
a
dog
does
not
growl
at
its
master
at
its
owner
perhaps
at
its
master
never
as
soon
would
a
devout
priest
blaspheme
his
deity
nor
does
a
dog
approach
anything
or
anybody
growling
and
with
lowered
head
unless
intent
on
battle
have
no
fear
when
a
dog
barks
or
even
growls
at
you
so
long
as
his
head
is
erect
but
when
he
growls
and
lowers
his
head
then
look
out
it
means
but
one
thing
the
master
had
been
the
master
the
sublime
blindly
revered
and
worshiped
master
for
all
the
blameless
years
of
lad
life
and
now
growling
head
down
the
dog
was
threatening
him
it
was
the
supreme
misery
the
crowning
hell
of
lad
career
for
the
first
time
two
overpowering
loves
fought
with
each
other
in
his
galahad
soul
and
the
love
for
poor
unjustly
blamed
lady
hurled
down
the
superlove
for
the
master
in
baring
teeth
upon
his
lord
the
collie
well
knew
what
he
was
incurring
but
he
did
not
flinch
understanding
that
swift
death
might
well
be
his
portion
he
stood
his
ground
is
there
greater
love
humans
sighing
swains
suitors
can
any
of
match
it
i
think
not
not
even
the
antonys
they
throw
away
only
the
mere
world
of
earthly
credit
for
love
the
master
jaw
set
he
was
as
unhappy
as
the
dog
for
he
grasped
the
situation
and
he
was
man
enough
to
honor
lad
proffered
sacrifice
yet
it
must
be
punished
and
punished
instantly
as
any
will
testify
let
a
dog
once
growl
or
show
his
teeth
in
menace
at
his
master
and
if
the
rebellion
be
not
put
down
in
drastic
fashion
the
master
ceases
forever
to
be
master
and
degenerates
to
mere
owner
his
mysterious
power
over
his
dog
is
gone
for
all
time
turning
his
back
on
lady
the
master
whirled
his
in
air
lad
saw
the
lash
coming
down
he
did
not
flinch
he
did
not
cower
the
growl
ceased
the
collie
stood
erect
down
came
the
braided
whiplash
on
lad
shoulders
again
over
his
loins
and
yet
again
and
again
without
moving
head
up
dark
tender
eyes
unwinking
the
took
the
scourging
when
it
was
over
he
waited
only
to
see
the
master
throw
the
fiercely
into
a
corner
of
the
study
then
knowing
lady
was
safe
lad
walked
majestically
back
to
his
cave
under
the
piano
and
with
a
long
quivering
sigh
he
lay
down
his
spirit
was
sick
and
crushed
within
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
thoroughbred
life
he
had
been
struck
for
he
was
one
of
those
not
wholly
rare
dogs
to
whom
a
sharp
word
of
reproof
is
more
effective
than
a
beating
to
whom
a
blow
is
not
a
pain
but
a
damning
and
overwhelming
ignominy
had
a
human
other
than
the
master
presumed
to
strike
him
the
assailant
must
have
fought
for
life
through
the
numbness
of
lad
grief
bit
by
bit
began
to
smolder
and
glow
a
deathless
hate
for
knave
the
cause
of
lady
humiliation
lad
had
known
what
passed
behind
that
closed
study
door
as
well
as
though
he
had
seen
for
ears
and
scent
serve
a
true
collie
quite
as
usefully
as
do
mere
eyes
the
master
was
little
happier
than
was
his
favorite
dog
for
he
loved
lad
as
he
would
have
loved
a
human
son
though
lad
did
not
realize
it
the
master
had
let
off
lady
from
the
rest
of
her
beating
in
order
not
to
increase
her
champion
grief
he
simply
ordered
her
out
of
the
study
and
as
she
limped
away
the
master
tried
to
rekindle
his
own
indignation
and
deaden
his
sense
of
remorse
by
gathering
together
the
strewn
fragments
of
the
eagle
it
occurred
to
him
that
though
the
bird
was
destroyed
he
might
yet
have
its
silvery
head
mounted
on
a
board
as
a
minor
trophy
but
he
could
not
find
the
head
search
the
study
as
he
would
he
could
not
find
it
he
remembered
distinctly
that
lady
had
been
panting
as
she
slunk
out
of
the
room
and
dogs
that
are
carrying
things
in
their
mouths
can
not
pant
she
had
not
taken
the
head
away
with
her
the
absence
of
the
head
only
deepened
the
whole
annoying
domestic
mystery
he
gave
up
trying
to
solve
any
of
the
puzzle
from
lady
incredible
vandalism
to
this
newest
turn
of
the
affair
not
until
two
days
later
could
lad
bring
himself
to
risk
a
meeting
with
lady
the
cause
and
the
witness
of
his
beating
then
yearning
for
a
sight
of
her
and
for
even
her
grudged
recognition
of
his
presence
after
his
hours
of
isolation
he
sallied
forth
from
the
house
in
search
of
her
he
traced
her
to
the
cool
shade
of
a
lilac
clump
near
the
outbuildings
there
having
with
one
paw
dug
a
little
pit
in
the
cool
earth
she
was
curled
up
asleep
under
the
bushes
stretched
out
beside
her
was
knave
lad
spine
bristled
at
sight
of
his
foe
but
ignoring
him
he
moved
over
to
lady
and
touched
her
nose
with
his
own
in
timid
caress
she
opened
one
eye
blinked
drowsily
and
went
to
sleep
again
but
lad
coming
had
awakened
knave
much
refreshed
by
his
nap
he
woke
in
playful
mood
he
tried
to
induce
lady
to
romp
with
him
but
she
preferred
to
doze
so
casting
about
in
his
shallow
mind
for
something
to
play
with
knave
chanced
to
remember
the
prize
he
had
hidden
beneath
the
away
he
ambled
returning
presently
with
the
eagle
head
between
his
teeth
as
he
ran
he
tossed
it
aloft
catching
it
as
it
fell
a
pretty
trick
he
had
long
since
learned
with
a
lad
who
had
lain
down
as
near
to
sleepily
scornful
lady
as
he
dared
looked
up
and
saw
him
approach
he
saw
too
with
what
knave
was
playing
and
as
he
saw
he
went
quite
mad
here
was
the
thing
that
had
caused
lady
interrupted
punishment
and
his
own
black
disgrace
knave
was
exploiting
it
with
manifest
and
brazen
delight
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
and
for
the
second
time
in
three
days
lad
broke
the
law
he
forgot
in
a
trice
the
command
let
him
alone
and
noiseless
terrible
he
flew
at
the
gamboling
knave
knave
was
aware
of
the
attack
barely
in
time
to
drop
the
eagle
head
and
spring
forward
to
meet
his
antagonist
he
was
three
years
junior
and
was
perhaps
five
pounds
heavier
moreover
constant
exercise
had
kept
him
in
condition
while
lonely
brooding
at
home
had
begun
of
late
to
soften
lad
tough
sinews
knave
was
mildly
surprised
that
the
dog
he
had
looked
on
as
a
dullard
and
a
poltroon
should
have
developed
a
flash
of
spirit
but
he
was
not
at
all
unwilling
to
wage
a
combat
whose
victory
must
make
him
shine
with
redoubled
glory
in
lady
eyes
like
two
furry
whirlwinds
the
collies
spun
forward
toward
each
other
they
met
upreared
and
snarled
slashing
for
the
throat
clawing
madly
to
retain
balance
then
down
they
went
rolling
in
a
right
unloving
embrace
snapping
tearing
growling
lad
drove
straight
for
the
throat
a
of
knave
golden
ruff
came
away
in
his
jaws
for
except
at
the
exact
center
a
collie
throat
is
protected
by
a
tangle
of
hair
as
effective
against
assault
as
were
andrew
jackson
breastworks
at
new
orleans
and
lad
had
missed
the
exact
center
over
and
over
they
rolled
they
regained
their
footing
and
reared
again
lad
tusk
ripped
a
furrow
in

satiny
forehead
and
knave
half
deflected
slash
in
return
set
bleeding
the
big
vein
at
the
top
of
lad
left
ear
lady
was
wide
awake
long
before
this
standing
immovable
yet
wildly
excited
after
the
fashion
of
the
female
brute
for
whom
males
battle
and
who
knows
she
is
to
be
the
winner
prize
she
watched
every
turn
of
the
fight
up
once
more
the
dogs
clashed
chest
to
chest
knave
with
an
instinctive
throwback
to
his
wolf
forebears
of
five
hundred
years
earlier
dived
for
lad
forelegs
with
the
hope
of
breaking
one
of
them
between
his
foaming
jaws
he
missed
the
hold
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
the
skin
alone
was
torn
and
down
over
the
little
white
forepaw
one
of
the
forepaws
that
lad
was
wont
to
lick
for
an
hour
a
day
to
keep
them
snowy
ran
a
trickle
of
blood
that
miss
was
a
costly
error
for
knave
for
lad
teeth
sought
and
found
his
left
shoulder
and
sank
deep
therein
knave
twisted
and
wheeled
with
lightning
speed
and
with
all
his
strength
yet
had
not
his
ruff
choked
lad
and
pressed
stranglingly
against
his
nostrils
all
the
heavier
dog
struggles
would
not
have
set
him
free
as
it
was
lad
gasping
for
breath
enough
to
fill
his
lungs
relaxed
his
grip
ever
so
slightly
and
in
that
fraction
of
a
second
knave
tore
free
leaving
a
mouthful
of
hair
and
skin
in
his
enemy
jaws
in
the
same
wrench
that
liberated
him
and
as
the
relieved
tension
sent
lad
stumbling
forward
knave
instinctively
saw
his
chance
and
took
it
again
heredity
came
to
his
aid
for
he
tried
a
manoeuver
known
only
to
wolves
and
to
collies
flashing
above
his
stumbling
foe
head
knave
seized
lad
from
behind
just
below
the
base
of
the
skull
and
holding
him
thus
helpless
he
proceeded
to
grit
and
grind
his
teeth
in
the
slow
relentless
motion
that
must
soon
or
late
eat
down
to
and
sever
the
spinal
cord
lad
even
as
he
thrashed
frantically
about
felt
there
was
no
escape
he
was
as
powerless
against
a
strong
opponent
in
this
position
as
is
a
puppy
that
is
held
up
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
without
a
sound
but
still
struggling
as
best
he
might
he
awaited
his
fate
no
longer
was
he
growling
or
snarling
his
patient
bloodshot
eyes
sought
wistfully
for
lady
and
they
did
not
find
her
for
even
as
they
sought
her
a
novel
element
entered
into
the
battle
lady
hitherto
awaiting
with
true
feminine
meekness
the
outcome
of
the
scrimmage
saw
her
old
flame
terrible
plight
under
the
grinding
jaws
and
proving
herself
false
to
all
canons
of
ancestry
moved
by
some
impulse
she
did
not
try
to
resist
she
jumped
forward
forgetting
the
pain
in
her
swollen
foot
she
nipped
knave
sharply
in
the
hind
leg
then
as
if
abashed
by
her
unfeminine
behavior
she
drew
back
in
shame
but
the
work
was
done
through
the
red
war
lust
knave
dimly
realized
that
he
was
attacked
from
behind
perhaps
that
his
new
opponent
stood
an
excellent
chance
of
gaining
upon
him
such
a
as
he
himself
now
held
he
loosed
his
grip
and
whizzed
about
frothing
and
snapping
to
face
the
danger
before
knave
had
half
completed
his
lightning
whirl
lad
had
him
by
the
side
of
the
throat
it
was
no
this
yet
it
was
not
only
acutely
painful
but
it
held
its
victim
quite
as
powerless
as
he
had
just
now
held
lad
bearing
down
with
all
his
weight
and
setting
his
white
little
front
teeth
and
his
yellowing
tusks
firmly
in
their
hold
lad
gradually
shoved
knave
head
sideways
to
the
ground
and
held
it
there
the
result
on
knave
activities
was
much
the
same
as
is
obtained
by
sitting
on
the
head
of
a
kicking
horse
that
has
fallen
unable
to
wrench
loose
helpless
to
counter
in
keen
agony
from
the
pinching
of
the
tender
beneath
the
masses
of
ruff
knave
lost
his
nerve
and
he
forthwith
justified
those
yellowish
streaks
in
his
whereof
the
had
spoken
he
made
the
air
vibrate
with
his
abject
howls
of
pain
and
fear
he
was
caught
he
could
not
get
away
lad
was
hurting
him
horribly
wherefore
he
as
might
any
gutter
cur
whose
tail
is
stepped
upon
presently
beyond
the
fight
haze
lad
saw
a
shadow
in
front
of
him
a
shadow
that
resolved
itself
in
the
settling
dust
as
the
master
and
lad
came
to
himself
he
loosed
his
hold
on
knave
throat
and
stood
up
groggily
knave
still
yelping
tucked
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
fled
for
his
life
out
of
the
place
out
of
your
story
slowly
stumblingly
but
without
a
waver
of
hesitation
lad
went
up
to
the
master
he
was
gasping
for
breath
and
he
was
weak
from
fearful
exertion
and
from
loss
of
blood
up
to
the
master
he
went
straight
up
to
him
and
not
until
he
was
a
scant
two
yards
away
did
he
see
that
the
master
held
something
in
his
hand
that
abominable
head
which
he
had
just
picked
up
probably
the
was
in
the
other
hand
it
did
not
matter
much
lad
was
ready
for
this
final
degradation
he
would
not
try
to
dodge
it
he
the
double
breaker
of
laws
then
the
master
was
kneeling
beside
him
the
kind
hand
was
caressing
the
dog
dizzy
head
the
dear
voice
a
queer
break
in
it
was
saying
remorsefully
oh
lad
laddie
i
so
sorry
so
sorry
you
you
more
of
a
man
than
i
am
old
friend
i
make
it
up
to
you
somehow
and
now
besides
the
loved
hand
there
was
another
touch
even
more
precious
a
warmly
caressing
little
pink
tongue
that
licked
his
bleeding
foreleg
lady
timidly
adoringly
was
trying
to
stanch
her
hero
wounds
lady
i
apologize
to
you
too
went
on
the
foolish
master
sorry
girl
lady
was
too
busy
soothing
the
hurts
of
her
newly
discovered
mate
to
understand
but
lad
understood
lad
always
understood
chapter
ii
quiet
to
lad
the
real
world
was
bounded
by
the
place
outside
there
were
a
certain
number
of
miles
of
land
and
there
were
an
uncertain
number
of
people
but
the
miles
were
uninspiring
except
for
a
tramp
with
the
master
and
the
people
were
foolish
and
strange
folk
who
either
stared
at
him
which
always
annoyed
lad
or
else
tried
to
pat
him
which
he
hated
but
the
place
was
the
place
always
he
had
lived
on
the
place
he
felt
he
owned
it
it
was
assuredly
his
to
enjoy
to
guard
to
patrol
from
high
road
to
lake
it
was
his
world
the
denizens
of
every
world
must
have
at
least
one
deity
to
worship
lad
had
one
the
master
indeed
he
had
two
the
master
and
the
mistress
and
because
the
dog
was
strong
of
soul
and
chivalric
withal
and
because
the
mistress
was
altogether
lovable
lad
placed
her
altar
even
above
the
master
which
was
wholly
as
it
should
have
been
there
were
other
people
at
the
place
people
to
whom
a
dog
must
be
courteous
as
becomes
a
thoroughbred
and
whose
caresses
he
must
accept
very
often
there
were
guests
too
and
from
puppyhood
lad
had
been
taught
the
sacredness
of
the
guest
law
civilly
he
would
endure
the
pettings
of
these
visiting
outlanders
gravely
he
would
shake
hands
with
them
on
request
he
would
even
permit
them
to
paw
him
or
haul
him
about
if
they
were
of
the
obnoxious
breed
but
the
moment
politeness
would
permit
he
always
withdrew
very
quietly
from
their
reach
and
if
possible
from
their
sight
as
well
of
all
the
dogs
on
the
place
big
lad
alone
had
free
run
of
the
house
by
day
and
by
night
he
slept
in
a
cave
under
the
piano
he
even
had
access
to
the
sacred
at
mealtimes
where
always
he
lay
to
the
left
of
the
master
chair
with
the
master
he
would
willingly
unbend
for
a
romp
at
any
or
all
times
at
the
mistress
behest
he
would
play
with
all
the
silly
abandon
of
a
puppy
rolling
on
the
ground
at
her
feet
making
as
though
to
seize
and
crush
one
of
her
little
shoes
in
his
mighty
jaws
wriggling
and
waving
his
legs
in
air
when
she
buried
her
hand
in
the
masses
of
his
and
otherwise
comporting
himself
with
complete
loss
of
dignity
but
to
all
except
these
two
he
was
calmly
unapproachable
from
his
earliest
days
he
had
never
forgotten
he
was
an
aristocrat
among
inferiors
and
calmly
aloof
he
moved
among
his
subjects
then
all
at
once
into
the
sweet
routine
of
the
house
of
peace
came
horror
it
began
on
a
blustery
sour
october
day
the
mistress
had
crossed
the
lake
to
the
village
in
her
canoe
with
lad
curled
up
in
a
furry
heap
in
the
prow
on
the
return
trip
about
fifty
yards
from
shore
the
canoe
struck
sharply
and
obliquely
against
a
log
that
a
fall
freshet
had
swept
down
from
the
river
above
the
lake
at
the
same
moment
a
flaw
of
wind
caught
the
canoe
quarter
and
after
the
manner
of
such
eccentric
craft
the
canvas
shell
proceeded
to
turn
turtle
into
the
waters
splashed
its
two
occupants
lad
bobbed
to
the
top
and
glanced
around
at
the
mistress
to
learn
if
this
were
a
new
practical
joke
but
instantly
he
saw
it
was
no
joke
at
all
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
swathed
and
cramped
by
the
folds
of
her
heavy
outing
skirt
the
mistress
was
making
no
progress
shoreward
and
the
dog
flung
himself
through
the
water
toward
her
with
a
rush
that
left
his
shoulders
and
half
his
back
above
the
surface
in
a
second
he
had
reached
her
and
had
caught
her
in
his
teeth
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
lie
out
straight
as
though
she
were
floating
and
to
fill
her
lungs
with
a
swift
intake
of
breath
the
dog
burden
was
thus
made
infinitely
lighter
than
if
she
had
struggled
or
had
lain
in
a
posture
less
easy
for
towing
yet
he
made
scant
headway
until
she
wound
one
hand
in
his
mane
and
still
lying
motionless
and
stiff
bade
him
loose
his
hold
on
her
shoulder
in
this
way
by
sustained
effort
that
wrenched
every
giant
muscle
in
the
collie
body
they
came
at
last
to
land
vastly
rejoiced
was
lad
and
inordinately
proud
of
himself
and
the
plaudits
of
the
master
and
the
mistress
were
music
to
him
indefinably
he
understood
he
had
done
a
very
wonderful
thing
and
that
everybody
on
the
place
was
talking
about
him
and
that
all
were
trying
to
pet
him
at
once
this
promiscuous
handling
he
began
to
find
unwelcome
and
he
retired
at
last
to
his
cave
under
the
piano
to
escape
from
it
matters
soon
quieted
down
and
the
incident
seemed
at
an
end
instead
it
had
just
begun
for
within
an
hour
the
mistress
who
for
days
had
been
with
a
cold
was
stricken
with
a
chill
and
by
night
she
was
in
the
first
stages
of
pneumonia
then
over
the
place
descended
gloom
a
gloom
lad
could
not
understand
until
he
went
upstairs
at
to
escort
the
mistress
as
usual
to
the
but
to
his
light
scratch
at
her
door
there
was
no
reply
he
scratched
again
and
presently
master
came
out
of
the
room
and
ordered
him
again
then
from
the
master
voice
and
look
lad
understood
that
something
was
terribly
amiss
also
as
she
did
not
appear
at
dinner
and
as
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
forbidden
to
go
into
her
room
he
knew
the
mistress
was
the
victim
of
whatever
mishap
had
befallen
a
strange
man
with
a
black
bag
came
to
the
house
early
in
the
evening
and
he
and
the
master
were
closeted
for
an
interminable
time
in
the
mistress
room
lad
had
crept
dejectedly
upstairs
behind
them
and
sought
to
crowd
into
the
room
at
their
heels
the
master
ordered
him
back
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
lad
lay
down
on
the
threshold
his
nose
to
the
crack
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
and
waited
he
heard
the
murmur
of
speech
once
he
caught
the
mistress
voice
changed
and
muffled
and
with
a
puzzling
new
note
in
it
but
undeniably
the
mistress
and
his
tail
thumped
hopefully
on
the
hall
floor
but
no
one
came
to
let
him
in
and
after
the
mandate
to
keep
out
he
dared
not
scratch
for
admittance
the
doctor
almost
stumbled
across
the
couchant
body
of
the
dog
as
he
left
the
room
with
the
master
being
a
himself
the
doctor
understood
and
his
narrow
escape
from
a
fall
over
the
living
obstacle
did
not
irritate
him
but
it
reminded
him
of
something
those
other
dogs
of
yours
outside
there
he
said
to
the
master
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
raised
a
fearful
racket
when
my
car
came
down
the
drive
just
now
better
send
them
all
away
somewhere
till
she
is
better
the
house
must
be
kept
perfectly
quiet
the
master
looked
back
up
the
stairway
at
its
top
pressed
close
against
the
mistress
door
crouched
lad
something
in
the
heartbroken
attitude
touched
him
i
send
them
over
to
the
in
the
morning
he
answered
all
except
lad
he
and
i
are
going
to
see
this
through
together
he
be
quiet
if
i
tell
him
to
all
through
the
endless
night
while
the
october
wind
howled
and
yelled
around
the
house
lad
lay
outside
the
door
his
nose
between
his
absurdly
small
white
paws
his
sorrowful
eyes
wide
open
his
ears
alert
for
the
faintest
sound
from
the
room
beyond
sometimes
when
the
wind
screamed
its
loudest
lad
would
lift
his
head
his
ruff
his
teeth
glinting
from
under
his
upcurled
lip
and
he
would
growl
a
throaty
menace
it
was
as
though
he
heard
in
the
tempest
racket
the
strife
of
evil
to
burst
in
through
the
rattling
windows
and
attack
the
stricken
mistress
perhaps
well
perhaps
there
are
things
visible
and
audible
to
dogs
to
which
humans
were
deaf
and
blind
or
perhaps
they
are
not
lad
was
there
when
day
broke
and
when
the
master
from
sleeplessness
came
out
he
was
there
when
the
other
dogs
were
herded
into
the
car
and
carried
away
to
the
lad
was
there
when
the
car
came
back
from
the
station
bringing
to
the
place
an
angular
woman
with
yellow
hair
and
a
yellower
suitcase
a
horrible
woman
who
vaguely
smelt
of
disinfectants
and
of
rigid
efficiency
and
who
presently
approached
the
clad
and
capped
in
stiff
white
lad
hated
her
he
was
there
when
the
doctor
came
for
his
morning
visit
to
the
invalid
and
again
he
tried
to
edge
his
own
way
into
the
room
only
to
be
rebuffed
once
more
this
is
the
third
time
i
nearly
broken
my
neck
over
that
miserable
dog
chidingly
announced
the
nurse
later
in
the
day
as
she
came
out
of
the
room
and
chanced
to
meet
the
master
on
the
landing
do
please
drive
him
away
tried
to
do
it
but
he
only
snarls
at
me
and
in
a
dangerous
case
like
this
leave
him
alone
briefly
ordered
the
master
but
when
the
nurse
sniffing
passed
on
he
called
lad
over
to
him
reluctantly
the
dog
quitted
the
door
and
obeyed
the
summons
quiet
ordered
the
master
speaking
very
slowly
and
distinctly
you
must
keep
quiet
understand
lad
understood
lad
always
understood
he
must
not
bark
he
must
move
silently
he
must
make
no
unnecessary
sound
but
at
least
the
master
had
not
forbidden
him
to
snarl
softly
and
loathingly
at
that
detestable
woman
every
time
she
stepped
over
him
so
there
was
one
grain
of
comfort
gently
the
master
called
him
downstairs
and
across
the
and
put
him
out
of
the
house
for
after
all
a
shaggy
dog
is
an
inconvenience
stretched
across
a
doorsill
three
minutes
later
lad
had
made
his
way
through
an
open
window
into
the
cellar
and
thence
upstairs
and
was
stretched
out
head
between
paws
at
the
threshold
of
the
mistress
room
on
his
visits
the
doctor
was
forced
to
step
over
him
and
was
man
enough
to
forbear
to
curse
twenty
times
a
day
the
nurse
stumbled
over
his
massive
inert
body
and
fumed
in
impotent
rage
the
master
too
came
back
and
forth
from
the
with
now
and
then
a
kindly
word
for
the
suffering
collie
and
again
and
again
put
him
out
of
the
house
but
always
lad
managed
by
hook
or
crook
to
be
back
on
guard
within
a
minute
or
two
and
never
once
did
the
door
of
the
mistress
room
open
that
he
did
not
make
a
strenuous
attempt
to
enter
servants
nurse
doctor
and
master
repeatedly
forgot
he
was
there
and
stubbed
their
toes
across
his
body
sometimes
their
feet
drove
agonizingly
into
his
tender
flesh
but
never
a
whimper
or
growl
did
the
pain
wring
from
him
had
been
the
command
and
he
was
obeying
and
so
it
went
on
through
the
awful
days
and
the
infinitely
worse
nights
except
when
he
was
ordered
away
by
the
master
lad
would
not
stir
from
his
place
at
the
door
and
not
even
the
master
authority
could
keep
him
away
from
it
for
five
minutes
a
day
the
dog
ate
nothing
drank
practically
nothing
took
no
exercise
moved
not
one
inch
of
his
own
will
from
the
doorway
in
vain
did
the
glories
of
autumn
woods
call
to
him
the
rabbits
would
be
thick
out
yonder
in
the
forest
just
now
so
would
the
squirrels
against
which
lad
had
long
since
sworn
a
and
one
of
which
it
had
ever
been
his
futile
life
ambition
to
catch
for
him
these
things
no
longer
existed
nothing
existed
except
his
mortal
hatred
of
the
unseen
something
in
that
forbidden
room
the
something
that
was
seeking
to
take
the
mistress
away
with
it
he
yearned
unspeakably
to
be
in
that
room
to
guard
her
from
her
nameless
peril
and
they
would
not
let
him
in
these
humans
wherefore
he
lay
there
crushing
his
body
close
against
the
door
and
waiting
and
inside
the
room
death
and
the
napoleonic
man
with
the
black
bag
fought
their
duel
for
the
life
of
the
still
little
white
figure
in
the
great
white
bed
one
night
the
doctor
did
not
go
home
at
all
toward
dawn
the
master
lurched
out
of
the
room
and
sat
down
for
a
moment
on
the
stairs
his
face
in
his
hands
then
and
then
only
during
all
that
time
of
watching
did
lad
leave
the
doorsill
of
his
own
accord
shaky
with
famine
and
weariness
he
got
to
his
feet
moaning
softly
and
crept
over
to
the
master
he
lay
down
beside
him
his
huge
head
athwart
the
man
knees
his
muzzle
reaching
timidly
toward
the
hands
presently
the
master
went
back
into
the
sickroom
and
lad
was
left
alone
in
the
darkness
to
wonder
and
to
listen
and
to
wait
with
a
tired
sigh
he
returned
to
the
door
and
once
more
took
up
his
heartsick
vigil
then
on
a
golden
morning
days
later
the
doctor
came
and
went
with
the
look
of
a
conqueror
even
the
nurse
forgot
to
grunt
in
disgust
when
she
stumbled
across
the
dog
body
she
almost
smiled
and
presently
the
master
came
out
through
the
doorway
he
stopped
at
sight
of
lad
and
turned
back
into
the
room
lad
could
hear
him
speak
and
he
heard
a
dear
voice
make
answer
very
weakly
but
no
longer
in
that
muffled
and
foreign
tone
which
had
so
frightened
him
then
came
a
sentence
the
dog
could
understand
come
in
old
friend
said
the
master
opening
the
door
and
standing
aside
for
lad
to
enter
at
a
bound
the
collie
was
in
the
room
there
lay
the
mistress
she
was
very
thin
very
white
very
feeble
but
she
was
there
the
dread
something
had
lost
the
battle
lad
wanted
to
break
forth
into
a
peal
of
ecstatic
barking
that
would
have
deafened
every
one
in
the
room
the
master
read
the
wish
and
interposed
lad
heard
he
controlled
the
yearning
but
it
cost
him
a
world
of
to
do
it
as
sedately
as
he
could
force
himself
to
move
he
crossed
to
the
bed
the
mistress
was
smiling
at
him
one
hand
was
stretched
weakly
forth
to
stroke
him
and
she
was
saying
almost
in
a
whisper
lad
laddie
that
was
all
but
her
hand
was
petting
him
in
the
dear
way
he
loved
so
well
and
the
master
was
telling
her
all
over
again
how
the
dog
had
watched
outside
her
door
lad
listened
not
to
the
man
praise
but
to
the
woman
caressing
whisper
and
he
quivered
from
head
to
tail
he
fought
furiously
with
himself
once
again
to
choke
back
the
rapturous
barking
that
clamored
for
utterance
he
knew
this
was
no
time
for
noise
even
without
the
word
of
warning
he
would
have
known
it
for
the
mistress
was
whispering
even
the
master
was
speaking
scarce
louder
but
one
thing
lad
realized
the
black
danger
was
past
the
mistress
was
alive
and
the
whole
house
was
smiling
that
was
enough
and
the
yearning
to
show
in
noise
his
own
wild
relief
was
all
but
irresistible
then
the
master
said
run
on
lad
you
can
come
back
and
the
dog
gravely
made
his
way
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
the
minute
he
was
he
proceeded
to
go
crazy
nothing
but
sheer
mania
could
excuse
his
actions
during
the
rest
of
that
day
they
were
unworthy
of
a
mongrel
puppy
and
never
before
in
all
his
blameless
stately
life
had
lad
so
grossly
misbehaved
as
he
now
proceeded
to
do
the
mistress
was
alive
the
horror
was
past
reaction
set
in
with
a
rush
as
i
have
said
lad
went
crazy
peter
grimm
the
mistress
cynical
and
temperamental
gray
cat
was
picking
its
dainty
way
across
the
lawn
as
lad
emerged
from
the
house
ordinarily
lad
regarded
peter
grimm
with
a
cold
tolerance
but
now
he
dashed
at
the
cat
with
a
semblance
of
stark
wrath
like
a
furry
whirlwind
he
bore
down
upon
the
amazed
feline
the
cat
in
dire
offense
scratched
his
nose
with
a
quite
unnecessary
virulence
and
fled
up
a
tree
spitting
and
yowling
tail
fluffed
out
as
thick
as
a
man
wrist
seeing
that
peter
grimm
had
resorted
to
unsportsmanly
tactics
by
scrambling
whither
he
could
not
follow
lad
remembered
the
need
for
silence
and
forbore
to
bark
threats
at
his
escaped
victim
instead
he
galloped
to
the
rear
of
the
house
where
stood
the
dairy
the
dairy
door
was
on
the
latch
with
his
head
lad
butted
it
open
and
ran
into
the
room
a
line
of
full
were
ranged
side
by
side
on
a
shelf
rising
on
his
and
bracing
his
forepaws
on
the
shelf
lad
seized
edges
of
the
deep
pans
one
after
another
between
his
teeth
and
with
a
succession
of
sharp
jerks
brought
them
one
and
all
clattering
to
the
floor
scampering
out
of
the
dairy
ankle
deep
in
a
river
of
spilt
milk
and
paying
no
heed
to
the
cries
of
the
scandalized
cook
he
charged
forth
in
the
open
again
his
eye
fell
on
a
red
cow
tethered
by
a
long
chain
in
a
beyond
the
stables
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
this
cow
she
had
been
on
the
place
since
before
he
was
born
yet
lad
spear
knew
no
brother
he
tore
across
the
lawn
and
past
the
stables
straight
at
the
astonished
bovine
in
terror
the
cow
threw
up
her
tail
and
sought
to
lumber
away
at
top
speed
being
controlled
by
her
tether
she
could
run
only
in
a
wide
circle
and
around
and
around
this
circle
lad
drove
the
bellowing
brute
as
fast
as
he
could
make
her
run
until
the
gardener
came
panting
to
her
relief
but
neither
the
gardener
nor
any
other
living
creature
could
stay
lad
rampage
that
day
he
fled
merrily
up
to
the
lodge
at
the
gate
burst
into
its
kitchen
and
through
to
the
refrigerator
there
in
a
pan
he
found
a
raw
leg
of
mutton
seizing
this
morsel
in
his
teeth
and
dodging
the
indignant
housewife
he
careered
out
into
the
highway
with
his
prize
dug
a
hole
in
the
roadside
ditch
and
was
gleefully
preparing
to
bury
the
mutton
therein
when
its
outraged
owner
rescued
it
a
farmer
was
jogging
along
the
road
behind
a
horse
a
painful
nip
on
the
rear
turned
the
nag
drowsy
jog
into
a
really
industrious
effort
at
a
runaway
already
lad
had
sprung
clear
of
the
front
wheel
as
the
wagon
bumped
past
him
he
leaped
upward
deftly
caught
a
hanging
corner
of
the
and
hauled
it
free
of
the
seat
robe
in
mouth
he
capered
off
into
a
field
playfully
keeping
just
out
of
the
reach
of
the
pursuing
agrarian
and
at
last
he
deposited
the
stolen
treasure
in
the
heart
of
a
a
full
from
the
road
lad
made
his
way
back
to
the
place
by
a
wide
detour
that
brought
him
through
the
grounds
of
a
neighbor
of
the
master
this
neighbor
owned
a
dog
a
rangy
and
mangy
pest
of
a
brute
that
lad
would
ordinarily
have
scorned
to
notice
but
most
decidedly
he
noticed
the
dog
now
he
routed
it
out
of
its
kennel
and
bestowed
upon
it
a
thrashing
that
brought
its
possessor
entire
family
shrieking
to
the
scene
of
conflict
courteously
refusing
to
carry
the
matter
further
in
face
of
a
shouting
humans
lad
cantered
homeward
from
the
on
the
at
the
place
fluttered
a
large
white
object
it
was
palpably
a
nurse
uniform
palpably
nurse
uniform
and
lad
greeted
its
presence
there
with
a
grin
of
pure
bliss
in
less
than
two
seconds
the
uniform
was
off
the
line
with
three
huge
rents
marring
its
stiff
surface
in
less
than
thirty
seconds
it
was
reposing
in
the
rich
black
mud
on
the
verge
of
the
lake
and
lad
was
rolling
playfully
on
it
then
he
chanced
to
remember
his
enemies
the
squirrels
and
his
prey
the
rabbits
and
he
loped
off
to
the
forest
to
wage
gay
warfare
upon
them
he
was
gloriously
idiotically
criminally
happy
and
for
the
time
he
was
a
fool
all
day
long
complaints
came
pouring
in
to
the
master
lad
had
destroyed
the
whole
set
of
cream
lad
had
chased
the
red
cow
till
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
she
did
fall
sick
of
it
lad
had
scared
poor
dear
little
peter
grimm
so
badly
that
the
cat
seemed
likely
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
its
nine
lives
squalling
in
the
and
crossly
refusing
to
come
down
lad
had
spoiled
a
sunday
leg
of
mutton
up
at
the
lodge
lad
had
made
a
perfectly
respectable
horse
run
madly
away
for
nearly
feet
and
had
given
the
horse
owner
a
blasphemous
run
over
a
plowed
field
after
a
cherished
and
ravished
lad
had
killed
a
neighbor
particularly
killable
dog
lad
had
wantonly
destroyed
the
nurse
very
newest
and
most
expensive
uniform
all
day
it
was
lad
lad
lad
lad
it
seemed
was
a
whence
radiated
complaints
that
ran
the
whole
gamut
from
tears
to
lurid
profanity
and
to
each
and
every
complainant
the
master
made
the
same
answer
leave
him
alone
we
just
out
of
hell
lad
and
i
he
doing
the
things
i
do
myself
if
i
had
the
nerve
which
of
course
was
a
manifestly
asinine
way
for
a
grown
man
to
talk
long
after
dusk
lad
pattered
meekly
home
very
tired
and
quite
sane
his
spell
of
imbecility
had
worn
itself
out
he
was
once
more
his
calmly
dignified
self
though
not
a
little
ashamed
of
his
babyish
pranks
and
mildly
wondering
how
he
had
come
to
behave
so
still
he
could
not
grieve
over
what
he
had
done
he
could
not
grieve
over
anything
just
yet
the
mistress
was
alive
and
while
the
craziness
had
passed
the
happiness
had
not
tired
drowsily
at
peace
with
all
the
world
he
curled
up
under
the
piano
and
went
to
sleep
he
slept
so
soundly
that
the
locking
of
the
house
for
the
night
did
not
rouse
him
but
something
else
did
something
that
occurred
long
after
everyone
on
the
place
was
sound
asleep
lad
was
joyously
pursuing
through
the
forest
aisles
of
dreamland
a
whole
army
of
squirrels
that
had
not
sense
enough
to
climb
trees
when
in
a
moment
he
was
wide
awake
and
on
guard
far
off
very
far
off
he
heard
a
man
walking
now
to
a
trained
dog
there
is
as
much
difference
in
the
sound
of
human
footfalls
as
to
humans
there
is
a
difference
in
the
aspect
of
human
faces
a
belated
countryman
walking
along
the
highway
a
furlong
distant
would
not
have
awakened
lad
from
sleep
also
he
knew
and
could
classify
at
any
distance
the
footsteps
of
everyone
who
lived
on
the
place
but
the
steps
that
had
brought
him
wide
awake
and
on
the
alert
did
not
belong
to
one
of
the
place
people
nor
were
they
the
steps
of
anybody
who
had
a
right
to
be
on
the
premises
someone
had
climbed
the
fence
at
a
distance
from
the
drive
and
was
crossing
the
grounds
obliquely
toward
the
house
it
was
a
man
and
he
was
still
nearly
two
hundred
yards
away
moreover
he
was
walking
stealthily
and
pausing
every
now
and
then
as
if
to
reconnoiter
no
human
at
that
distance
could
have
heard
the
steps
no
dog
could
have
helped
hearing
them
had
the
other
dogs
been
at
home
instead
of
at
the
the
place
would
by
this
time
have
been
with
barks
both
scent
and
sound
would
have
given
them
ample
warning
of
the
stranger
presence
to
lad
on
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
where
every
window
was
shut
the
aid
of
scent
was
denied
yet
his
sense
of
hearing
was
enough
plainly
he
heard
the
softly
advancing
steps
heard
and
read
them
he
read
them
for
an
intruder
read
them
for
the
steps
of
a
man
who
was
afraid
to
be
heard
or
seen
and
who
was
employing
all
the
caution
in
his
power
a
booming
trumpeting
bark
of
warning
sprang
into
lad
throat
and
died
there
the
sharp
command
was
still
in
force
even
in
his
madness
that
day
he
had
uttered
no
sound
he
strangled
back
the
tumultuous
bark
and
listened
in
silence
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
had
come
out
from
under
the
piano
in
the
middle
of
the
he
stood
head
lowered
ears
pricked
his
ruff
was
abristle
a
ridge
of
hair
rose
grotesquely
from
the
shaggy
mass
of
coat
along
his
spine
his
lips
had
slipped
back
from
his
teeth
and
so
he
stood
and
waited
the
shuffling
soft
steps
were
nearer
now
down
through
the
trees
they
came
and
then
onto
the
springy
grass
of
the
lawn
now
they
crunched
lightly
on
the
gravel
of
the
drive
lad
moved
forward
a
little
and
again
stood
at
attention
the
man
was
climbing
to
the
veranda
the
vines
rustled
ever
so
slightly
as
he
brushed
past
them
his
footfall
sounded
lightly
on
the
veranda
itself
next
there
was
a
faint
clicking
noise
at
the
lock
of
one
of
the
bay
windows
presently
by
half
inches
the
window
began
to
rise
before
it
had
risen
an
inch
lad
knew
the
trespasser
was
a
negro
also
that
it
was
no
one
with
whose
scent
he
was
familiar
another
pause
followed
by
the
very
faintest
scratching
as
the
negro
ran
a
along
the
crack
of
the
inner
wooden
blinds
in
search
of
the
catch
the
blinds
parted
slowly
over
the
the
man
threw
a
leg
then
he
stepped
down
noiselessly
into
the
room
he
stood
there
a
second
evidently
listening
and
before
he
could
stir
or
breathe
something
in
the
darkness
hurled
itself
upon
him
without
so
much
as
a
growl
of
warning
eighty
pounds
of
muscular
hairy
energy
smote
the
negro
full
in
the
chest
a
set
of
jaws
flashed
for
his
jugular
vein
missed
it
by
a
and
the
graze
left
a
searing
pain
along
the
negro
throat
in
the
merest
fraction
of
a
moment
the
murderously
snapping
jaws
sank
into
the
thief
shoulder
it
is
collie
custom
to
fight
with
a
running
accompaniment
of
snarling
growls
but
lad
did
not
give
voice
in
total
silence
he
made
his
onslaught
in
silence
he
sought
and
gained
his
hold
the
negro
was
less
considerate
of
the
mistress
comfort
with
a
screech
that
would
have
waked
every
mummy
in
egypt
he
reeled
back
under
that
first
unseen
impact
lost
his
balance
and
crashed
to
the
hardwood
floor
overturning
a
table
and
a
lamp
in
his
fall
certain
that
a
devil
had
attacked
him
there
in
the
black
darkness
the
man
gave
forth
yell
after
yell
of
mortal
terror
frantically
he
strove
to
push
away
his
assailant
and
his
clammy
hand
encountered
a
mass
of
fur
the
negro
had
heard
that
all
the
dogs
on
the
place
had
been
sent
away
because
of
the
mistress
illness
hence
his
attempt
at
burglary
hence
also
his
panic
fear
when
lad
had
sprung
on
him
but
with
the
feel
of
the
thick
warm
fur
the
man
superstitious
terror
died
he
knew
he
had
roused
the
house
but
there
was
still
time
to
escape
if
he
could
rid
himself
of
this
silent
terrible
creature
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
with
the
knife
he
still
clutched
he
smote
viciously
at
his
assailant
because
lad
was
a
collie
lad
was
not
killed
then
and
there
a
bulldog
or
a
attacking
a
man
seeks
for
some
convenient
hold
having
secured
that
hold
be
it
good
or
bad
he
locks
his
jaws
and
hangs
on
you
can
cut
his
head
from
his
body
before
he
will
let
go
thus
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
any
armed
man
who
can
keep
cool
long
enough
to
kill
him
but
a
collie
has
a
strain
of
wolf
in
his
queer
brain
he
seeks
a
hold
it
is
true
but
at
an
instant
notice
he
is
ready
to
shift
that
hold
for
a
better
he
may
bite
or
slash
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
seconds
and
in
as
many
parts
of
the
body
he
is
everywhere
at
once
he
is
nowhere
in
particular
he
is
not
a
pleasant
opponent
lad
did
not
wait
for
the
negro
knife
to
find
his
heart
as
the
man
lunged
the
dog
transferred
his
profitless
shoulderhold
to
a
grip
on
the
stabbing
arm
the
knife
blade
plowed
an
ugly
furrow
along
his
side
and
the
dog
curved
slashed
the
negro
arm
from
elbow
to
wrist
clean
through
to
the
bone
the
knife
clattered
to
the
floor
the
negro
wheeled
and
made
a
leap
for
the
open
window
he
had
not
cleared
half
the
space
when
lad
bounded
for
the
back
of
his
neck
the
dog
upper
set
of
teeth
raked
the
man
hard
skull
carrying
away
a
handful
of
wool
and
flesh
and
his
weight
threw
the
thief
forward
on
hands
and
knees
again
twisting
the
man
found
the
dog
furry
throat
and
with
both
hands
sought
to
strangle
him
at
the
same
time
backing
out
through
the
window
but
it
is
not
easy
to
strangle
a
collie
the
piles
of
tumbled
form
a
protection
no
other
breed
of
dog
can
boast
scarcely
had
the
hands
found
their
grip
when
one
of
them
was
crushed
between
the
jaws
the
negro
flung
off
his
enemy
and
turned
to
clear
the
veranda
at
a
single
jump
but
before
he
had
half
made
the
turn
lad
was
at
his
throat
again
and
the
two
crashed
through
the
vines
together
and
down
onto
the
driveway
below
the
entire
combat
had
not
lasted
for
more
than
thirty
seconds
the
master
pistol
and
flashlight
in
hand
ran
down
to
find
the
amuck
with
blood
and
with
smashed
furniture
and
one
of
the
windows
open
he
flashed
the
electric
ray
through
the
window
on
the
ground
below
stunned
by
striking
against
a
stone
jardinière
in
his
fall
the
negro
sprawled
senseless
upon
his
back
above
him
was
lad
his
searching
teeth
at
last
having
found
their
coveted
steadily
the
great
dog
was
grinding
his
way
through
toward
the
jugular
there
was
a
deal
of
noise
and
excitement
and
light
after
that
the
negro
was
trussed
up
and
the
local
constable
was
summoned
by
telephone
everybody
seemed
to
be
doing
much
loud
talking
lad
took
advantage
of
the
turmoil
to
slip
back
into
the
house
and
to
his
cave
under
the
piano
where
he
proceeded
to
lick
solicitously
the
flesh
wound
on
his
left
side
he
was
very
tired
and
he
was
very
unhappy
and
he
was
very
much
worried
in
spite
of
all
his
own
precautions
as
to
silence
the
negro
had
made
a
most
ungodly
lot
of
noise
the
commandment
had
been
fractured
past
repair
and
somehow
lad
felt
blame
for
it
all
it
was
really
his
fault
and
he
realized
it
now
that
the
man
had
made
such
a
racket
would
the
master
punish
him
perhaps
humans
have
such
odd
ideas
of
justice
he
then
it
was
that
the
master
found
him
and
called
him
forth
from
his
place
of
refuge
head
adroop
tail
low
lad
crept
out
to
meet
his
scolding
he
looked
very
much
like
a
puppy
caught
tearing
a
new
rug
but
suddenly
the
master
and
everyone
else
in
the
room
was
patting
him
and
telling
him
how
splendid
he
was
and
the
master
had
found
the
deep
scratch
on
his
side
and
was
dressing
it
and
stopping
every
minute
or
so
to
praise
him
again
and
then
as
a
crowning
reward
he
was
taken
upstairs
for
the
mistress
to
stroke
and
make
much
of
when
at
last
he
was
sent
downstairs
again
lad
did
not
return
to
his
instead
he
went
and
away
from
the
place
and
when
he
thought
he
was
far
enough
from
the
house
he
solemnly
sat
down
and
began
to
bark
it
was
good
good
to
be
able
to
make
a
noise
again
he
had
never
before
known
how
needful
to
canine
happiness
a
bark
really
is
he
had
long
and
pressing
arrears
of
barks
in
his
system
and
thunderously
he
proceeded
to
divest
himself
of
them
for
nearly
half
an
hour
then
feeling
much
better
he
ambled
homeward
to
take
up
normal
life
again
after
a
whole
fortnight
of
martyrdom
chapter
iii
a
miracle
of
two
the
connecting
points
between
the
inner
and
outer
lad
were
a
pair
of
the
wisest
and
darkest
and
most
sorrowful
eyes
in
all
dogdom
eyes
that
gave
the
lie
to
folk
who
say
no
dog
has
a
soul
there
are
such
dogs
once
in
a
human
generation
lad
had
but
one
tyrant
in
all
the
world
that
was
his
dainty
lady
lady
whose
affections
he
had
won
in
fair
battle
with
a
younger
and
stronger
dog
lady
who
bullied
him
unmercifully
and
teased
him
and
did
fearful
things
to
his
stately
dignity
and
to
whom
he
allowed
liberties
that
would
have
brought
any
other
aggressor
painfully
near
to
death
lady
was
and
capricious
a
collie
de
luxe
lad
and
she
were
as
oddly
contrasted
a
couple
in
body
and
mind
as
one
could
find
in
a
day
journey
through
their
north
jersey
hinterland
to
the
place
at
intervals
far
too
few
between
to
suit
lad
came
human
guests
people
for
the
most
part
who
did
not
understand
dogs
and
who
either
drew
away
in
causeless
fear
from
them
or
else
insisted
on
patting
or
hauling
them
about
lad
detested
guests
he
met
their
advances
with
cold
courtesy
and
as
soon
as
possible
got
himself
out
of
their
way
he
knew
the
law
far
too
well
to
snap
or
to
growl
at
a
guest
but
the
law
did
not
compel
him
to
stay
within
patting
distance
of
one
the
careless
caress
of
the
mistress
or
the
master
especially
of
the
mistress
was
a
delight
to
him
he
would
sport
like
an
overgrown
puppy
with
either
of
these
deities
throwing
dignity
to
the
four
winds
but
to
them
alone
did
he
unbend
to
them
and
to
his
adored
tyrant
lady
to
the
place
of
a
cold
spring
morning
came
a
guest
or
two
guests
lad
at
first
was
not
certain
which
the
visible
guest
was
a
woman
and
in
her
arms
she
carried
a
long
bundle
that
might
have
been
anything
at
all
long
as
was
the
bundle
it
was
ridiculously
light
or
rather
pathetically
light
for
its
folds
contained
a
child
five
years
old
a
child
that
ought
to
have
weighed
more
than
forty
pounds
and
weighed
barely
twenty
a
child
with
a
wizened
little
old
face
and
with
a
skeleton
body
which
was
powerless
from
the
waist
down
six
months
earlier
the
baby
had
been
as
vigorous
and
jolly
as
a
collie
pup
until
an
invisible
something
prowled
through
the
land
laying
its
on
thousands
of
such
jolly
and
vigorous
youngsters
as
frost
fingers
are
laid
on
autumn
flowers
and
with
the
same
hideous
effect
this
particular
baby
had
not
died
of
the
plague
as
had
so
many
of
her
fellows
at
least
her
brain
and
the
upper
half
of
her
body
had
not
died
her
mother
had
been
counseled
to
try
mountain
air
for
the
hopeless
little
invalid
she
had
written
to
her
distant
relative
the
mistress
asking
leave
to
spend
a
month
at
the
place
lad
viewed
the
arrival
of
the
adult
guest
with
no
interest
and
with
less
pleasure
he
stood
aloof
at
one
side
of
the
veranda
as
the
newcomer
alighted
from
the
car
but
when
the
master
took
the
long
bundle
from
her
arms
and
carried
it
up
the
steps
lad
waxed
curious
not
only
because
the
master
handled
his
burden
so
carefully
but
because
the
collie
uncanny
told
him
all
at
once
that
it
was
human
lad
had
never
seen
a
human
carried
in
this
manner
it
did
not
make
sense
to
him
and
he
stepped
hesitantly
forward
to
investigate
the
master
laid
the
bundle
tenderly
on
the
veranda
and
loosed
the
that
swathed
it
lad
came
over
to
him
and
looked
down
into
the
pitiful
little
face
there
had
been
no
baby
at
the
place
for
many
a
year
lad
had
seldom
seen
one
at
such
close
quarters
but
now
the
sight
did
something
queer
to
his
heart
the
big
heart
that
ever
went
out
to
the
weak
and
defenseless
the
heart
that
made
a
playfully
snapping
puppy
or
a
cranky
little
lapdog
as
safe
from
his
terrible
jaws
as
was
lady
herself
he
sniffed
in
friendly
fashion
at
the
child
pathetically
upturned
face
into
the
dull
at
sight
of
him
came
a
look
of
pleased
interest
the
first
that
had
crossed
their
blankness
for
many
a
long
day
two
feeble
little
hands
reached
out
and
buried
themselves
lovingly
in
the
mass
of
soft
ruff
that
circled
lad
neck
the
dog
quivered
all
over
from
nose
to
brush
with
joy
at
the
touch
he
laid
his
great
head
down
beside
the
drawn
cheek
and
positively
reveled
in
the
pain
the
tugging
fingers
were
inflicting
on
his
sensitive
throat
in
one
instant
lad
had
widened
his
narrow
and
circle
of
loved
ones
to
include
this
wisp
of
humanity
the
child
mother
came
up
the
steps
in
the
master
wake
at
sight
of
the
huge
dog
she
halted
in
quick
alarm
look
out
she
shrilled
he
may
attack
her
oh
drive
him
away
who
lad
queried
the
mistress
why
lad
would
harm
a
hair
of
her
head
if
his
life
depended
on
it
see
he
adores
her
already
i
never
knew
him
to
take
to
a
stranger
before
and
she
looks
brighter
and
happier
too
than
she
has
looked
in
months
do
make
her
cry
by
sending
him
away
from
her
but
insisted
the
woman
dogs
are
full
of
germs
i
read
so
he
might
give
her
some
terrible
lad
is
just
as
clean
and
as
germless
as
i
am
declared
the
mistress
with
some
warmth
there
is
a
day
he
does
swim
in
the
lake
and
there
is
a
day
i
do
brush
him
he
he
a
collie
though
protested
the
guest
looking
on
in
uneasy
distaste
while
baby
secured
a
tighter
and
more
painful
grip
on
the
delighted
dog
ruff
and
i
always
heard
collies
are
awfully
treacherous
do
you
find
them
so
if
we
did
put
in
the
master
who
had
heard
that
same
asinine
question
until
it
sickened
him
if
we
found
collies
were
treacherous
we
would
keep
them
a
collie
is
either
the
best
dog
or
the
worst
dog
on
earth
lad
is
the
best
we
do
keep
the
other
kind
i
call
him
away
though
if
it
bothers
you
to
have
him
so
close
to
baby
come
lad
reluctantly
the
dog
turned
to
obey
the
law
glancing
back
as
he
went
at
the
adorable
new
idol
he
had
acquired
then
crossing
obediently
to
where
the
master
stood
the
baby
face
puckered
unhappily
her
pipestem
arms
went
out
toward
the
collie
in
a
tired
little
voice
she
called
after
him
dog
come
back
here
right
away
i
love
you
dog
lad
vibrating
with
eagerness
glanced
up
at
the
master
for
leave
to
answer
the
call
the
master
in
turn
looked
inquiringly
at
his
nervous
guest
lad
translated
the
look
and
instantly
he
felt
an
unreasoning
hate
for
the
fussy
woman
the
guest
walked
over
to
her
weakly
gesticulating
daughter
and
explained
dogs
are
nice
pets
for
sick
little
girls
dear
they
rough
and
besides
they
bite
i
find
dolly
for
you
as
soon
as
i
unpack
do
want
dolly
fretted
the
child
want
the
dog
he
rough
he
wo
bite
doggie
i
love
you
come
lad
looked
up
longingly
at
the
master
his
plumed
tail
his
ears
up
his
eyes
dancing
one
hand
of
the
master
stirred
toward
the
hammock
in
a
motion
so
imperceptible
that
none
but
a
sharply
watchful
dog
could
have
observed
it
lad
waited
for
no
second
bidding
quietly
unobtrusively
he
crossed
behind
the
guest
and
stood
beside
his
idol
the
baby
fairly
squealed
with
rapture
and
drew
his
silken
head
down
to
her
face
oh
well
surrendered
the
guest
sulkily
if
she
wo
be
happy
any
other
way
let
him
go
to
her
i
suppose
it
safe
if
you
people
say
so
and
it
the
first
thing
she
been
interested
in
since
darling
she
broke
off
sternly
you
shall
kiss
him
i
draw
the
line
at
that
here
let
mamma
rub
your
lips
with
her
handkerchief
dogs
are
made
to
be
kissed
said
the
master
sharing
however
lad
disgust
at
the
process
but
she
come
to
less
harm
from
kissing
the
head
of
a
clean
dog
than
from
kissing
the
mouths
of
most
humans
i
glad
she
likes
lad
and
i
still
gladder
that
he
likes
her
it
almost
the
first
time
he
ever
went
to
an
outsider
of
his
own
accord
that
was
how
lad
idolatry
began
and
that
too
was
how
a
miserably
sick
child
found
a
new
interest
in
life
every
day
from
morning
to
dusk
lad
was
with
the
baby
forsaking
his
immemorial
cave
under
the
piano
he
lay
all
night
outside
the
door
of
her
bedroom
in
preference
even
to
a
romp
through
the
forest
with
lady
he
would
pace
majestically
alongside
the
wheelchair
as
it
was
trundled
along
the
walks
or
up
and
down
the
veranda
forsaking
his
post
on
the
floor
at
the
left
of
the
master
seat
at
meals
a
place
that
had
been
his
alone
since
puppyhood
he
lay
always
behind
the
baby
table
couch
this
to
the
vast
discomfort
of
the
maid
who
had
to
step
over
him
in
circumnavigating
the
board
and
to
the
open
annoyance
of
the
child
mother
baby
as
the
days
went
on
lost
none
of
her
first
pleasure
in
her
shaggy
playmate
to
her
the
dog
was
a
ceaseless
novelty
she
loved
to
twist
and
braid
the
great
white
ruff
on
his
chest
to
toy
with
his
sensitive
ears
to
make
him
speak
or
shake
hands
or
lie
down
or
stand
up
at
her
bidding
she
loved
to
play
a
myriad
of
intricate
games
with
him
games
ranging
from
and
the
to
princess
and
whether
as
to
her
or
in
the
more
complex
and
exacting
rôle
of
lad
entered
wholesouledly
into
every
such
game
of
course
he
always
played
his
part
wrong
equally
of
course
baby
always
lost
her
temper
at
his
stupidity
and
pummeled
him
by
way
of
chastisement
with
her
nerveless
fists
a
punishment
lad
accepted
with
a
grin
of
idiotic
bliss
whether
because
of
the
keenly
bracing
mountain
air
or
because
of
her
outdoor
days
with
a
chum
who
awoke
her
dormant
interest
in
life
baby
was
growing
stronger
and
less
like
a
sallow
ghostling
and
in
the
relief
of
noting
this
steady
improvement
her
mother
continued
to
tolerate
lad
chumship
with
the
child
although
she
had
never
lost
her
own
first
unreasoning
fear
of
the
big
dog
two
or
three
things
happened
to
revive
this
foolish
dread
one
of
them
occurred
about
a
week
after
the
invalid
arrival
at
the
place
lady
being
no
fonder
of
guests
than
was
lad
had
given
the
veranda
and
the
house
itself
a
wide
berth
but
one
day
as
baby
lay
in
the
hammock
trying
in
a
wordy
irritation
to
teach
lad
the
alphabet
and
as
the
guest
sat
with
her
back
to
them
writing
letters
lady
trotted
around
the
corner
of
the
porch
at
sight
of
the
hammock
queer
occupant
she
paused
and
stood
blinking
inquisitively
baby
spied
the
graceful
creature
pushing
lad
to
one
side
she
called
imperiously
come
here
new
doggie
you
pretty
doggie
lady
her
vanity
thus
appealed
to
strolled
mincingly
forward
just
within
arm
reach
she
halted
again
baby
thrust
out
one
hand
and
seized
her
by
the
ruff
to
draw
her
into
the
sudden
tug
on
lady
fur
was
as
nothing
to
the
haulings
and
maulings
in
which
lad
so
meekly
reveled
but
lad
and
lady
were
by
no
means
alike
as
i
think
i
have
said
boundless
patience
and
a
chivalrous
love
for
the
weak
were
not
numbered
among
lady
erratic
virtues
she
liked
liberties
as
little
as
did
lad
and
she
had
a
far
more
drastic
way
of
resenting
them
at
the
first
pinch
of
her
sensitive
skin
there
was
an
instant
flash
of
gleaming
teeth
accompanied
by
a
nasty
growl
and
a
forward
lunge
of
the
dainty
head
as
the
wolf
slashes
at
a
foe
and
as
no
animals
but
wolf
and
collie
know
how
to
lady
slashed
murderously
at
the
thin
little
arm
that
sought
to
pull
her
along
and
lad
in
the
same
breath
hurled
his
great
bulk
between
his
mate
and
his
idol
it
was
a
move
unbelievably
swift
for
so
large
a
dog
and
it
served
its
turn
the
slash
that
would
have
cut
the
little
girl
arm
to
the
bone
sent
a
red
furrow
athwart
lad
massive
shoulder
before
lady
could
snap
again
or
indeed
could
get
over
her
surprise
at
her
mate
intervention
lad
was
shouldering
her
off
the
edge
of
the
veranda
steps
very
gently
he
did
this
and
with
no
show
of
teeth
but
he
did
it
with
much
firmness
in
angry
amazement
at
such
rudeness
on
the
part
of
her
usually
subservient
mate
lady
snarled
ferociously
and
bit
at
him
just
then
the
child
mother
roused
from
her
by
the
turmoil
came
rushing
to
her
endangered
offspring
rescue
he
growled
at
baby
she
reported
hysterically
as
the
noise
brought
the
master
out
of
his
study
and
to
the
veranda
on
the
run
he
at
her
and
then
he
and
that
other
horrid
brute
got
to
fighting
and
pardon
me
interposed
the
master
calling
both
dogs
to
him
but
man
is
the
only
animal
to
maltreat
the
female
of
his
kind
no
male
dog
would
fight
with
lady
much
less
would
lad
hello
he
broke
off
look
at
his
shoulder
though
that
was
meant
for
baby
instead
of
scolding
lad
you
may
thank
him
for
saving
her
from
an
ugly
slash
i
keep
lady
chained
up
after
this
but
but
with
lad
beside
her
baby
is
in
just
about
as
much
danger
as
she
would
be
with
a
guard
of
forty
regulars
went
on
the
master
take
my
word
for
it
come
along
lady
it
the
kennel
for
you
for
the
next
few
weeks
old
girl
lad
when
i
get
back
i
wash
that
shoulder
for
you
with
a
sigh
lad
went
over
to
the
hammock
and
lay
down
heavily
for
the
first
time
since
baby
advent
at
the
place
he
was
unhappy
very
unhappy
he
had
had
to
jostle
and
fend
off
lady
whom
he
worshipped
and
he
knew
it
would
be
many
a
long
day
before
his
sensitively
temperamental
mate
would
forgive
or
forget
meantime
so
far
as
lady
was
concerned
he
was
in
coventry
and
just
because
he
had
saved
from
injury
a
baby
who
had
meant
no
harm
and
who
could
not
help
herself
life
all
at
once
seemed
dismayingly
complex
to
lad
simple
soul
he
whimpered
a
little
under
his
breath
and
lifted
his
head
toward
baby
dangling
hand
for
a
caress
that
might
help
make
things
easier
but
baby
had
been
bitterly
chagrined
at
lady
reception
of
her
friendly
advances
lady
could
not
be
punished
for
this
but
lad
could
she
slapped
the
lovingly
upthrust
muzzle
with
all
her
feeble
force
for
once
lad
was
not
amused
by
the
castigation
he
sighed
a
second
time
and
curled
up
on
the
floor
beside
the
hammock
in
a
right
miserable
heap
his
head
between
his
tiny
forepaws
his
great
sorrowful
eyes
abrim
with
bewildered
grief
spring
drowsed
into
early
summer
and
with
the
passing
days
baby
continued
to
look
less
and
less
like
an
atrophied
mummy
and
more
like
a
thin
but
normal
child
of
five
she
ate
and
slept
as
she
had
not
done
for
many
a
month
the
lower
half
of
her
body
was
still
dead
but
there
was
a
faint
glow
of
pink
in
the
flat
cheeks
and
the
eyes
were
alive
once
more
the
hands
that
pulled
at
lad
in
impulsive
friendliness
or
in
punishment
were
stronger
too
their
hurt
worse
than
at
first
but
the
hurt
always
gave
lad
that
same
twinge
of
pleasure
a
twinge
that
helped
to
ease
his
heart
ache
over
the
defection
of
lady
on
a
hot
morning
in
early
june
when
the
mistress
and
the
master
had
driven
over
to
the
village
for
the
mail
the
child
mother
wheeled
the
invalid
chair
to
a
nook
down
by
the
lake
a
spot
whose
deep
shade
and
lush
long
grass
promised
more
coolness
than
did
the
veranda
it
was
just
the
spot
a
would
have
chosen
for
a
nap
and
just
the
spot
through
which
no
countryman
would
have
cared
to
venture
at
that
dry
season
without
wearing
high
boots
here
not
three
days
earlier
the
master
had
killed
a
copperhead
snake
here
every
summer
during
the
late
june
mowing
the
moved
with
glum
caution
and
seldom
did
their
progress
go
unmarked
by
the
body
of
at
least
one
snake
the
place
for
the
most
part
lay
on
hillside
and
plateau
free
from
poisonous
snakes
of
all
kinds
and
usually
free
from
mosquitoes
as
well
the
lawn
sloped
down
to
the
lake
to
one
side
of
it
in
a
narrow
stretch
of
a
row
of
weeping
willows
pierced
the
loose
stone
here
the
ground
was
seldom
here
the
grass
grew
rankest
here
also
driven
to
water
by
the
drought
abode
eft
lizard
and
an
occasional
snake
finding
coolness
and
moisture
in
the
long
grass
and
a
thousand
hiding
places
amid
the
or
the
if
either
the
mistress
or
the
master
had
been
at
home
on
this
morning
the
guest
would
have
been
warned
against
taking
baby
there
at
all
she
would
have
been
doubly
warned
against
the
folly
which
she
now
proceeded
to
commit
of
lifting
the
child
from
the
and
placing
her
on
a
spread
rug
in
the
grass
with
her
back
to
the
low
wall
the
rug
on
its
mattress
of
lush
grasses
was
soft
the
lake
breeze
stirred
the
lower
boughs
of
the
willows
the
air
was
pleasantly
cool
here
and
had
lost
the
dead
hotness
that
brooded
over
the
higher
ground
the
guest
was
well
pleased
with
her
choice
of
a
resting
place
lad
was
not
the
big
dog
had
been
growingly
uneasy
from
the
time
the
approached
the
twice
he
put
himself
in
front
of
it
only
to
be
ordered
aside
once
the
wheels
hit
his
ribs
with
jarring
impact
as
baby
was
laid
upon
her
grassy
bed
lad
barked
loudly
and
pulled
at
one
end
of
the
rug
with
his
teeth
the
guest
shook
her
parasol
at
him
and
ordered
him
back
to
the
house
lad
obeyed
no
orders
save
those
of
his
two
deities
instead
of
slinking
away
he
sat
down
beside
the
child
so
close
to
her
that
his
ruff
pressed
against
her
shoulder
he
did
not
lie
down
as
usual
but
sat
tulip
ears
erect
dark
eyes
cloudy
with
trouble
head
turning
slowly
from
side
to
side
nostrils
pulsing
to
a
human
there
was
nothing
to
see
or
hear
or
smell
other
than
the
cool
beauty
of
the
nook
the
soughing
of
the
breeze
in
the
willows
the
soft
fragrance
of
a
june
morning
to
a
dog
there
were
faint
rustling
sounds
that
were
not
made
by
the
breeze
there
were
equally
faint
and
elusive
scents
that
the
human
nose
could
not
register
notably
a
subtle
odor
as
of
crushed
cucumbers
if
ever
you
have
killed
a
you
know
that
smell
the
dog
was
worried
he
was
uneasy
his
uneasiness
would
not
let
him
sit
still
it
made
him
fidget
and
shift
his
position
and
once
or
twice
growl
a
little
under
his
breath
presently
his
eyes
brightened
and
his
brush
began
to
thud
gently
on
the
for
a
quarter
mile
above
the
place
car
was
turning
in
from
the
highway
in
it
were
the
mistress
and
the
master
coming
home
with
the
mail
now
everything
would
be
all
right
and
the
onerous
duties
of
guardianship
would
pass
to
more
capable
hands
as
the
car
rounded
the
corner
of
the
house
and
came
to
a
stop
at
the
front
door
the
guest
caught
sight
of
it
jumping
up
from
her
seat
on
the
rug
she
started
toward
it
in
quest
of
mail
so
hastily
did
she
rise
that
she
dislodged
one
of
the
wall
small
stones
and
sent
it
rattling
down
into
a
wide
crevice
between
two
larger
rocks
she
did
not
heed
the
tinkle
of
stone
on
stone
nor
a
sharp
little
hiss
that
followed
as
the
falling
missile
smote
the
coils
of
a
sleeping
copperhead
snake
in
one
of
the
wall
lowest
cavities
but
lad
heard
it
and
he
heard
the
slithering
of
scales
against
rocksides
as
the
snake
angrily
sought
new
sleeping
quarters
the
guest
walked
away
all
ignorant
of
what
she
had
done
and
before
she
had
taken
three
steps
a
triangular
head
was
pushed
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
wall
twistingly
the
copperhead
glided
out
onto
the
grass
at
the
very
edge
of
the
rug
the
snake
was
short
and
thick
and
dirty
with
a
distinct
and
intricate
pattern
interwoven
on
its
rough
upper
body
the
head
was
short
flat
between
eye
and
nostril
on
either
side
was
the
sinister
pinhole
that
is
the
infallible
mark
of
the
serpent
the
rattlesnake
swarms
among
some
of
the
stony
mountains
of
the
north
jersey
hinterland
though
seldom
nowadays
does
it
venture
into
the
valleys
but
the
copperhead
twin
brother
in
murder
to
the
rattler
still
infests
meadow
and
lakeside
smaller
fatter
deadlier
than
the
it
gives
none
of
the
warning
which
redeems
the
latter
from
complete
abhorrence
it
is
a
creature
as
evil
as
its
own
aspect
and
name
copperhead
and
rattlesnake
are
the
only
left
now
between
canada
and
virginia
out
from
its
oozed
the
reptile
along
the
fringe
of
the
rug
it
moved
for
a
foot
or
two
then
paused
uncertain
perhaps
momentarily
dazzled
by
the
light
it
stopped
within
a
yard
of
the
child
wizened
little
hand
that
rested
idle
on
the
rug
baby
other
arm
was
around
lad
and
her
body
was
between
him
and
the
snake
lad
with
a
shiver
freed
himself
from
the
frail
embrace
and
got
nervously
to
his
feet
there
are
two
things
and
perhaps
two
things
of
which
the
best
type
of
thoroughbred
collie
is
abjectly
afraid
and
from
which
he
will
run
for
his
life
one
is
a
mad
dog
the
other
is
a
poisonous
snake
instinct
and
the
horror
of
death
warn
him
violently
away
from
both
at
stronger
scent
and
then
at
sight
of
the
copperhead
lad
stout
heart
failed
him
gallantly
had
he
attacked
human
marauders
who
had
invaded
the
place
more
than
once
in
dashing
fearlessness
he
had
fought
with
dogs
larger
than
himself
with
a
gaiety
of
zest
he
had
tackled
and
deflected
a
bull
that
had
charged
head
down
at
the
mistress
commonly
speaking
he
knew
no
fear
yet
now
he
was
afraid
tremulously
quakingly
afraid
afraid
of
the
deadly
thing
that
was
halting
within
three
feet
of
him
with
only
the
baby
fragile
body
as
a
barrier
between
left
to
himself
he
would
have
taken
incontinently
to
his
heels
with
the
lower
animal
instinctive
appeal
to
a
human
in
moments
of
danger
he
even
pressed
closer
to
the
helpless
child
at
his
side
as
if
seeking
the
protection
of
her
humanness
a
great
wave
of
cowardice
shook
the
dog
from
foot
to
head
the
master
had
alighted
from
the
car
and
was
coming
down
the
hill
toward
his
guest
with
several
letters
in
his
hand
lad
cast
a
yearning
look
at
him
but
the
master
he
knew
was
too
far
away
to
be
summoned
in
time
by
even
the
most
imperious
bark
and
it
was
then
that
the
child
straying
gaze
fell
on
the
snake
with
a
gasp
and
a
shudder
baby
shrank
back
against
lad
at
least
the
upper
half
of
her
body
moved
away
from
the
peril
her
legs
and
feet
lay
inert
the
motion
jerked
the
rug
fringe
an
inch
or
two
disturbing
the
copperhead
the
snake
coiled
and
drew
back
its
head
the
forklike
maroon
tongue
playing
fitfully
with
a
cry
of
at
her
own
impotence
to
escape
the
child
caught
up
a
picture
book
from
the
rug
beside
her
and
flung
it
at
the
serpent
the
fluttering
book
missed
its
mark
but
it
served
its
purpose
by
giving
the
copperhead
reason
to
believe
itself
attacked
back
went
the
triangular
head
farther
than
ever
and
then
flashed
forward
the
double
move
was
made
in
the
minutest
fraction
of
a
second
a
full
third
of
the
squat
reddish
body
going
with
the
blow
the
copperhead
struck
it
struck
for
the
thin
knee
not
ten
inches
away
from
its
own
coiled
body
the
child
screamed
again
in
mortal
terror
before
the
scream
could
leave
the
lips
baby
was
knocked
flat
by
a
mighty
and
hairy
shape
that
lunged
across
her
toward
her
foe
and
the
copperhead
fangs
sank
deep
in
lad
nose
he
gave
no
sign
of
pain
but
leaped
back
as
he
sprang
his
jaws
caught
baby
by
the
shoulder
the
keen
teeth
did
not
so
much
as
bruise
her
soft
flesh
as
he
her
into
the
grass
behind
him
athwart
the
rug
again
lad
launched
himself
bodily
upon
the
coiled
snake
as
he
charged
the
fangs
found
a
second
mark
this
time
in
the
side
of
his
jaw
an
instant
later
the
copperhead
lay
twisting
and
writhing
and
thrashing
impotently
among
the
grassroots
its
back
broken
and
its
body
seared
almost
in
two
by
a
slash
of
the
dog
tusk
the
fight
was
over
the
menace
was
past
the
child
was
safe
and
in
her
rescuer
muzzle
and
jaw
were
two
deposits
of
mortal
poison
lad
stood
panting
above
the
prostrate
and
crying
baby
his
work
was
done
and
instinct
told
him
at
what
cost
but
his
idol
was
unhurt
and
he
was
happy
he
bent
down
to
lick
the
convulsed
little
face
in
mute
plea
for
pardon
for
his
needful
roughness
toward
her
but
he
was
denied
even
this
tiny
consolation
even
as
he
leaned
downward
he
was
knocked
prone
to
earth
by
a
blow
that
all
but
fractured
his
skull
at
the
child
first
terrified
cry
her
mother
had
turned
back
nearsighted
and
easily
confused
she
had
seen
only
that
the
dog
had
knocked
her
sick
baby
flat
and
was
plunging
across
her
body
next
she
had
seen
him
grip
baby
shoulder
with
his
teeth
and
drag
her
shrieking
along
the
ground
that
was
enough
the
primal
that
is
sometimes
almost
as
strong
in
woman
as
in
lioness
or
cow
was
aroused
fearless
of
danger
to
herself
the
guest
rushed
to
her
child
rescue
as
she
ran
she
caught
her
thick
parasol
by
the
ferule
and
swung
it
aloft
down
came
the
of
the
sunshade
on
the
head
of
the
dog
the
handle
was
as
large
as
a
woman
fist
and
was
composed
of
a
single
stone
set
in
four
silver
claws
as
lad
staggered
to
his
feet
after
the
terrific
blow
felled
him
the
impromptu
weapon
arose
once
more
in
air
descending
this
time
on
his
broad
shoulders
lad
did
not
cringe
did
not
seek
to
dodge
or
run
did
not
show
his
teeth
this
mad
assailant
was
a
woman
moreover
she
was
a
guest
and
as
such
sacred
under
the
guest
law
which
he
had
mastered
from
puppyhood
had
a
man
raised
his
hand
against
lad
a
man
other
than
the
master
or
a
guest
there
would
right
speedily
have
been
a
case
for
a
hospital
if
not
for
the
undertaker
but
as
things
now
were
he
could
not
resent
the
beating
his
head
and
shoulders
quivered
under
the
force
and
the
pain
of
the
blows
but
his
splendid
body
did
not
cower
and
the
woman
wild
with
fear
and
continued
to
smite
with
all
her
random
strength
then
came
the
rescue
at
the
first
blow
the
child
had
cried
out
in
fierce
protest
at
her
pet
her
cry
went
unheard
mother
she
shrieked
her
high
treble
cracked
with
anguish
mother
do
he
kept
the
snake
from
eating
me
he
the
frantic
woman
still
did
not
heed
each
successive
blow
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
little
onlooker
own
bare
heart
and
baby
under
the
stress
went
quite
mad
scrambling
to
her
feet
in
crazy
zeal
to
protect
her
beloved
playmate
she
tottered
forward
three
steps
and
seized
her
mother
by
the
skirt
at
the
touch
the
woman
looked
down
then
her
face
went
and
the
parasol
clattered
unnoticed
to
the
ground
for
a
long
instant
the
mother
stood
thus
her
eyes
wide
and
glazed
her
mouth
open
her
cheeks
ashy
staring
at
the
swaying
child
who
clutched
her
dress
for
support
and
who
was
sobbing
forth
incoherent
pleas
for
the
dog
the
master
had
broken
into
a
run
and
into
a
flood
of
wordless
profanity
at
sight
of
his
dog
punishment
now
he
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
and
was
glaring
dazedly
at
the
miracle
before
him
the
child
had
risen
and
had
walked
the
child
had
she
whose
lower
the
wise
doctors
had
declared
were
hopelessly
paralyzed
she
who
could
never
hope
to
twitch
so
much
as
a
single
toe
or
feel
any
sensation
from
the
hips
downward
small
wonder
that
both
guest
and
master
seemed
to
have
caught
for
the
moment
some
of
the
paralysis
that
so
magically
departed
from
the
invalid
and
yet
as
a
corps
of
learned
physicians
later
agreed
there
was
no
miracle
no
magic
about
it
baby
was
not
the
first
nor
the
thousandth
case
in
pathologic
history
in
which
paralyzed
sensory
powers
had
been
restored
to
their
normal
functions
by
means
of
a
shock
the
child
had
had
no
malformation
no
accident
to
injure
the
spine
or
the
between
limbs
and
brain
a
long
illness
had
left
her
powerless
country
air
and
new
interest
in
life
had
gradually
built
up
wasted
tissues
a
shock
had
communication
between
brain
and
lower
body
a
communication
that
had
been
suspended
not
broken
when
at
last
there
was
room
in
any
of
the
human
minds
for
aught
but
blank
wonder
and
gratitude
the
joyously
weeping
mother
was
made
to
listen
to
the
child
story
of
the
fight
with
the
snake
a
story
corroborated
by
the
master
find
of
the
copperhead
body
i
i
get
down
on
my
knees
to
that
dog
sobbed
the
guest
and
apologize
to
him
oh
i
wish
some
of
you
would
beat
me
as
i
beat
him
i
feel
so
much
better
where
is
he
the
question
brought
no
answer
lad
had
vanished
nor
could
eager
callings
and
searchings
bring
him
to
view
the
master
returning
from
a
hunt
through
the
forest
made
baby
tell
her
story
all
over
again
then
he
nodded
i
understand
he
said
feeling
a
ludicrously
unmanly
desire
to
cry
i
see
how
it
was
the
snake
must
have
bitten
him
at
least
once
probably
oftener
and
he
knew
what
that
meant
lad
knows
everything
everything
i
mean
if
he
had
known
a
little
less
he
have
been
human
but
if
he
been
human
he
probably
have
thrown
away
his
life
for
baby
thrown
away
his
life
repeated
the
guest
i
i
do
understand
surely
i
did
strike
him
hard
enough
to
no
returned
the
master
but
the
snake
did
you
mean
he
has
i
mean
it
is
the
nature
of
all
animals
to
crawl
away
alone
into
the
forest
to
die
they
are
more
considerate
than
we
they
try
to
cause
no
further
trouble
to
those
they
have
loved
lad
got
his
death
from
the
copperhead
fangs
he
knew
it
and
while
we
were
all
taken
up
with
the
wonder
of
baby
cure
he
quietly
went
away
to
die
the
mistress
got
up
hurriedly
and
left
the
room
she
loved
the
great
dog
as
she
loved
few
humans
the
guest
dissolved
into
a
flood
of
sloppy
tears
and
i
beat
him
she
wailed
i
beat
him
horribly
and
all
the
time
he
was
dying
from
the
poison
he
had
saved
my
child
from
oh
never
forgive
myself
for
this
the
longest
day
i
live
the
longest
day
is
a
long
day
drily
commented
the
master
and
is
the
easiest
of
all
lessons
to
learn
after
all
lad
was
only
a
dog
that
why
he
is
dead
the
place
atmosphere
tingled
with
jubilation
over
the
cure
her
uncertain
but
always
successful
efforts
at
walking
were
an
hourly
delight
but
through
the
general
joy
the
mistress
and
the
master
could
not
always
keep
their
faces
bright
even
the
guest
mourned
frequently
and
loudly
and
eloquently
the
passing
of
lad
and
baby
was
openly
inconsolable
at
the
loss
of
her
chum
at
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
the
master
let
himself
silently
out
of
the
house
for
his
usual
tramp
a
tramp
on
which
for
years
lad
had
always
been
his
companion
the
master
prepared
to
set
forth
alone
as
he
swung
shut
the
veranda
door
behind
him
something
arose
stiffly
from
a
porch
rug
something
the
master
looked
at
in
a
daze
of
unbelief
it
was
a
dog
yet
no
such
dog
as
had
ever
before
sullied
the
cleanness
of
the
place
veranda
the
animal
body
was
lean
to
emaciation
the
head
was
swollen
though
apparently
the
swelling
had
begun
to
recede
the
fur
from
spine
to
toe
from
nose
to
was
one
solid
and
shapeless
mass
of
caked
mud
the
master
sat
down
very
suddenly
on
the
veranda
floor
beside
the
brute
and
caught
it
in
his
arms
sputtering
disjointedly
lad
old
you
alive
again
you
you
yes
lad
had
known
enough
to
creep
away
to
the
woods
to
die
but
thanks
to
the
in
his
collie
blood
he
had
also
known
how
to
do
something
far
wiser
than
die
three
days
of
to
the
very
nostrils
in
the
mysteriously
healing
ooze
of
the
marshes
behind
the
forest
had
done
for
him
what
such
have
done
for
a
million
wild
creatures
it
had
drawn
out
the
and
had
left
him
whole
again
thin
shaky
on
the
legs
slightly
swollen
of
head
but
he
he
awfully
dirty
though
is
he
commented
the
guest
when
an
idiotic
from
the
master
had
summoned
the
whole
family
in
sketchy
attire
to
the
veranda
awfully
dirty
and
yes
curtly
assented
the
master
lad
head
between
his
caressing
hands
dirty
that
why
he
still
alive
chapter
iv
his
little
son
lad
mate
lady
was
the
only
one
of
the
little
people
about
the
place
who
refused
to
look
on
lad
with
due
reverence
in
her
she
teased
him
unmercifully
in
a
prettily
imperious
way
she
bossed
and
bullied
him
for
all
of
which
lad
adored
her
he
had
other
reasons
too
for
loving
lady
not
only
because
she
was
dainty
and
beautiful
and
was
caressingly
fond
of
him
but
because
he
had
won
her
in
fair
mortal
combat
with
the
younger
and
showier
knave
for
a
time
after
knave
routing
lad
was
blissfully
happy
in
undivided
comradeship
together
they
ranged
the
forests
beyond
the
place
in
search
of
rabbits
together
they
sprawled
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
disreputable
old
fur
rug
in
front
of
the
fire
together
they
did
joyous
homage
to
their
gods
the
mistress
and
the
master
then
in
the
late
summer
a
new
rival
appeared
to
be
accurate
three
rivals
and
they
took
up
all
of
lady
time
and
thought
and
love
poor
old
lad
was
made
to
feel
terribly
out
in
the
cold
the
trio
of
rivals
that
had
so
suddenly
claimed
lady
care
were
fuzzy
and
and
about
the
size
of
kittens
in
brief
they
were
three
thoroughbred
collie
puppies
two
of
them
were
tawny
brown
with
white
forepaws
and
chests
the
third
was
not
like
lad
in
color
but
like
the
mother
at
least
all
of
him
not
white
was
of
the
indeterminate
yellowish
which
at
three
months
or
earlier
turns
to
pale
gold
when
they
were
barely
a
fortnight
old
almost
as
soon
as
their
big
mournful
eyes
opened
the
two
brown
puppies
died
there
seemed
no
particular
reason
for
their
death
except
the
fact
that
a
collie
is
always
the
easiest
or
else
the
most
impossible
breed
of
dog
to
raise
the
fuzzy
grayish
baby
alone
was
left
the
puppy
which
was
soon
to
turn
to
white
and
gold
the
mistress
named
him
wolf
upon
baby
wolf
the
lavished
a
ridiculous
lot
of
attention
so
much
that
lad
was
miserably
lonely
the
great
collie
would
try
with
pathetic
eagerness
a
dozen
times
a
day
to
lure
his
mate
into
a
woodland
ramble
or
into
a
romp
on
the
lawn
but
lady
met
his
wistful
advances
with
absorbed
indifference
or
with
a
snarl
indeed
when
lad
ventured
overnear
the
fuzzy
baby
he
was
warned
off
by
a
querulous
growl
from
the
mother
or
by
a
slash
of
her
shiny
white
teeth
lad
could
not
at
all
understand
it
he
felt
no
particular
interest
only
a
mild
and
disapproving
curiosity
in
the
shapeless
little
whimpering
ball
of
fur
that
nestled
so
helplessly
against
his
beloved
side
he
could
not
understand
the
that
kept
lady
with
wolf
all
day
and
all
night
it
was
an
impulse
that
meant
nothing
to
lad
after
a
week
or
two
of
fruitless
effort
to
win
back
lady
interest
lad
coldly
and
wretchedly
gave
up
the
attempt
he
took
long
solitary
walks
by
himself
in
the
forest
retired
for
hours
at
a
time
to
sad
brooding
in
his
favorite
cave
under
the
piano
and
tried
to
console
himself
by
spending
all
the
rest
of
his
day
in
the
company
of
the
mistress
and
the
master
and
he
came
thoroughly
to
disapprove
of
wolf
recognizing
the
baby
intruder
as
the
cause
of
estrangement
from
himself
he
held
aloof
from
the
puppy
the
latter
was
beginning
to
emerge
from
his
newborn
shapelessness
his
coat
texture
was
changing
from
fuzz
to
silk
its
color
was
turning
from
gray
into
yellow
his
blunt
little
nose
was
lengthening
and
growing
thin
and
pointed
his
body
was
elongating
and
his
huge
feet
and
legs
were
beginning
to
shape
up
he
looked
more
like
a
dog
now
and
less
like
an
animated
muff
also
within
wolf
youthful
heart
awoke
the
devil
of
mischief
the
keen
urge
of
play
he
found
lady
a
playfellow
up
to
a
certain
point
but
a
painfully
sharp
pinch
from
her
teeth
or
a
reproving
and
slap
from
one
of
her
forepaws
was
likely
to
break
up
every
game
that
she
thought
had
gone
far
enough
when
wolf
clownish
roughness
at
length
got
on
her
nerves
so
in
search
of
an
additional
playmate
the
frolicsome
puppy
turned
to
lad
only
to
find
that
lad
would
not
play
with
him
at
all
lad
made
it
very
very
clear
to
everyone
except
to
the
fool
puppy
himself
that
he
had
no
desire
to
romp
or
to
associate
in
any
way
with
this
creature
which
had
ousted
him
from
lady
heart
being
cursed
with
a
soul
too
big
and
gentle
to
let
him
harm
anything
so
helpless
as
wolf
he
did
not
snap
or
growl
as
did
lady
when
the
puppy
teased
he
merely
walked
away
in
hurt
dignity
wolf
had
a
positive
genius
for
tormenting
lad
the
huge
collie
for
instance
would
be
snoozing
away
a
hot
hour
on
the
veranda
or
under
the
wistaria
vines
down
upon
him
from
nowhere
in
particular
would
pounce
wolf
the
puppy
would
seize
his
sleeping
father
by
the
ear
and
drive
his
sharp
little
fiercely
into
the
flesh
then
he
would
brace
himself
and
pull
backward
possibly
with
the
idea
of
dragging
lad
along
the
ground
lad
would
wake
in
pain
would
rise
in
dignified
unhappiness
to
his
feet
and
start
to
walk
off
the
puppy
still
hanging
to
his
ear
as
wolf
was
a
collie
and
not
a
bulldog
he
would
lose
his
grip
as
his
fat
little
body
left
the
ground
then
at
a
clumsy
gallop
he
would
pursue
lad
throwing
himself
against
his
father
forelegs
and
nipping
the
slender
ankles
all
this
was
torture
to
lad
and
dire
mortification
too
especially
if
humans
chanced
to
witness
the
scene
yet
never
did
he
retaliate
he
simply
got
out
of
the
way
lad
nowadays
used
to
leave
half
his
dinner
uneaten
and
he
took
to
moping
in
a
way
that
is
not
good
for
dog
or
man
for
the
moping
had
in
it
no
nothing
but
heartache
at
his
mate
desertion
and
a
weary
distaste
for
the
puppy
annoying
antics
it
was
bad
enough
for
wolf
to
have
supplanted
him
in
lady
affection
without
also
making
his
life
a
burden
and
humiliating
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
gods
therefore
lad
moped
lady
remained
nervously
fussy
over
her
one
child
and
wolf
continued
to
be
a
lovable
but
unmitigated
pest
the
mistress
and
the
master
tried
in
every
way
to
make
up
to
lad
for
the
positive
and
negative
afflictions
he
was
enduring
but
the
sorrowing
dog
unhappiness
grew
with
the
days
then
one
november
morning
lady
met
wolf
capering
playfulness
with
a
yell
of
rage
so
savage
as
to
send
the
puppy
scampering
away
in
mortal
terror
and
to
bring
the
master
out
from
his
study
on
a
run
for
no
normal
dog
gives
that
hideous
yell
except
in
racking
pain
or
in
illness
and
mere
pain
could
not
wring
such
a
sound
from
a
thoroughbred
the
master
called
lady
over
to
him
sullenly
she
obeyed
slinking
up
to
him
in
surly
unwillingness
her
nose
was
hot
and
dry
her
soft
brown
eyes
were
glazed
their
whites
a
dull
red
her
dense
coat
was
tumbled
after
a
quick
examination
the
master
shut
her
into
a
and
telephoned
for
a
veterinary
she
is
sickening
for
the
worst
form
of
distemper
reported
the
an
hour
later
perhaps
for
something
worse
dogs
seldom
get
distemper
after
they
a
year
old
but
when
they
do
it
dangerous
better
let
me
take
her
over
to
my
hospital
and
isolate
her
there
distemper
runs
through
a
kennel
faster
than
cholera
through
a
i
may
be
able
to
cure
her
in
a
month
or
two
or
i
may
not
anyhow
no
use
in
risking
your
other
dogs
lives
by
leaving
her
here
so
it
was
that
lad
saw
his
dear
mate
borne
away
from
him
in
the
tonneau
of
a
strange
man
car
lady
hated
to
go
she
whimpered
and
hung
back
as
the
vet
lifted
her
aboard
at
sound
of
her
whimper
lad
started
forward
head
low
lips
writhing
back
from
his
clenched
teeth
his
shaggy
throat
vibrant
with
growls
at
a
sharp
word
of
command
from
the
master
he
checked
his
onset
and
stood
uncertain
he
looked
at
his
departing
mate
his
dark
eyes
abrim
with
sorrow
then
glanced
at
the
master
in
an
agony
of
appeal
it
all
right
laddie
the
master
tried
to
console
him
stroking
the
dog
magnificent
head
as
he
spoke
it
all
right
it
the
only
chance
of
saving
her
lad
did
not
grasp
the
words
but
their
tone
was
reassuring
it
told
him
at
least
that
this
kidnaping
was
legal
and
must
not
be
prevented
sorrowfully
he
watched
the
chugging
car
out
of
sight
up
the
drive
then
with
a
sigh
he
walked
heavily
back
to
his
cave
beneath
the
piano
lad
alone
of
the
place
dogs
was
allowed
to
sleep
in
the
house
at
night
and
even
had
free
access
to
that
spot
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
the
doors
were
opened
he
dashed
out
in
search
of
lady
with
some
faint
hope
that
she
might
have
been
brought
back
in
the
night
he
ransacked
every
corner
of
the
place
for
her
he
did
not
find
lady
but
wolf
very
promptly
found
lad
wolf
was
lonely
too
terribly
lonely
he
had
just
spent
the
first
solitary
night
of
his
life
he
missed
the
furry
warm
body
into
whose
shelter
he
had
always
cuddled
for
sleep
he
missed
his
playmate
the
pretty
mother
who
had
been
his
fond
companion
there
are
few
things
so
mournful
as
the
eyes
of
even
the
happiest
collie
pup
this
morning
loneliness
had
intensified
the
melancholy
expression
in
wolf
eyes
but
at
sight
of
lad
the
puppy
gamboled
forward
with
a
falsetto
bark
of
joy
the
world
was
not
quite
empty
after
all
though
his
mother
had
cruelly
absented
herself
here
was
a
playfellow
that
was
better
than
nothing
and
up
to
lad
frisked
the
optimistic
little
chap
lad
saw
him
coming
the
older
dog
halted
and
instinctively
turned
aside
to
avoid
the
lively
little
nuisance
then
halfway
around
he
stopped
and
turned
back
to
face
the
puppy
lady
was
gone
gone
perhaps
forever
and
all
that
was
left
to
remind
lad
of
her
was
this
bumptious
and
little
son
of
hers
lady
had
loved
the
youngster
lady
whom
lad
so
loved
wolf
alone
was
left
and
wolf
was
in
some
mysterious
way
a
part
of
lady
so
instead
of
making
his
escape
as
the
pest
cantered
toward
him
lad
stood
where
he
was
wolf
bounded
upward
and
as
usual
nipped
merrily
at
one
of
lad
ears
lad
did
not
shake
off
his
tormentor
and
stalk
away
in
spite
of
the
pain
to
the
sensitive
flesh
he
remained
quiet
looking
down
at
the
joyful
puppy
with
a
sort
of
sorrowing
friendliness
he
seemed
to
realize
that
wolf
too
was
lonely
and
that
the
little
dog
was
helpless
tired
of
biting
an
unprotesting
ear
wolf
dived
for
lad
white
forelegs
gnawing
happily
at
them
with
a
playfully
unconscious
throwback
to
his
wolf
ancestors
who
sought
thus
to
disable
an
enemy
by
breaking
the
foreleg
bone
for
all
seemingly
aimless
had
its
origin
in
some
ancestral
custom
lad
bore
this
new
bother
unflinchingly
presently
wolf
left
off
the
sport
lad
crossed
to
the
veranda
and
lay
down
the
puppy
trotted
over
to
him
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
ears
cocked
and
head
on
one
side
as
if
planning
a
new
attack
on
his
supine
victim
then
with
a
little
satisfied
whimper
he
curled
up
close
against
his
father
shaggy
side
and
went
to
sleep
lad
gazed
down
at
the
slumberer
in
some
perplexity
he
seemed
even
inclined
to
resent
the
familiarity
of
being
used
for
a
pillow
then
noting
that
the
fur
on
the
top
of
the
puppy
sleepy
head
was
rumpled
lad
bent
over
and
began
softly
to
lick
back
the
tousled
hair
into
shape
with
his
curving
tongue
his
tongue
with
the
single
queer
blot
midway
on
its
surface
the
puppy
mumbled
drowsily
in
his
sleep
and
nestled
more
snugly
to
his
new
protector
and
thus
lad
assumed
formal
guardianship
of
his
obstreperous
little
son
it
was
a
guardianship
more
staunch
by
far
than
lady
had
been
of
late
for
animal
mothers
early
wear
out
their
zealously
love
for
their
young
by
the
time
the
latter
are
able
to
shift
for
themselves
the
maternal
care
ceases
and
later
on
the
relationship
drops
completely
out
of
mind
paternity
among
dogs
is
from
the
very
first
no
tie
at
all
lad
probably
had
no
idea
of
his
relationship
to
his
new
ward
his
adoption
of
wolf
was
due
solely
to
his
own
love
for
lady
and
to
the
big
heart
and
soul
that
stirred
him
into
pity
for
anything
helpless
lad
took
his
new
duties
very
seriously
indeed
he
not
only
accepted
the
annoyance
of
wolf
undivided
teasing
but
he
assumed
charge
of
the
puppy
education
as
well
this
to
the
amusement
of
everyone
on
the
place
but
everyone
amusement
was
kept
from
lad
the
sensitive
dog
would
rather
have
been
whipped
than
laughed
at
so
both
the
mistress
and
master
watched
the
educational
process
with
outwardly
straight
faces
a
puppy
needs
an
unbelievable
amount
of
educating
it
is
a
task
to
wear
threadbare
the
teacher
patience
and
to
do
all
kinds
of
things
to
the
temper
small
wonder
that
many
humans
lose
patience
and
temper
during
the
process
and
idiotically
resort
to
the
whip
to
the
and
to
bellowing
in
which
case
the
puppy
is
never
decently
educated
but
emerges
from
the
process
with
a
cowed
and
broken
spirit
or
with
an
incurable
streak
of
meanness
that
renders
him
worthless
time
patience
firmness
wisdom
gentleness
these
be
the
six
absolute
essentials
for
training
a
puppy
happy
the
human
who
is
blessed
with
any
three
of
these
qualities
lad
being
only
a
dog
was
abundantly
possessed
of
all
six
and
he
had
need
of
them
to
begin
with
wolf
had
a
joyous
yearning
to
tear
up
or
bury
every
portable
thing
that
could
be
buried
or
torn
he
had
a
craze
for
destruction
a
dropped
lace
handkerchief
a
cushion
left
on
the
grass
a
book
or
a
hat
lying
on
a
these
and
a
thousand
other
things
he
looked
on
as
to
be
destroyed
as
quickly
and
as
delightedly
as
possible
he
also
enjoyed
taking
a
flying
leap
onto
the
face
or
body
of
any
he
would
howl
long
and
lamentably
nearly
every
night
at
the
moon
if
the
night
were
moonless
he
howled
on
general
principles
he
thrilled
with
bliss
at
a
chance
to
harry
and
terrify
the
chickens
or
peacocks
or
pigeons
or
any
others
of
the
little
people
that
were
safe
prey
for
him
he
tried
this
form
of
bullying
once
only
once
on
the
mistress
temperamental
gray
cat
peter
grimm
for
the
rest
of
the
day
wolf
nursed
a
scratched
nose
and
a
torn
ear
which
for
nearly
a
week
taught
him
to
give
all
cats
a
wide
berth
or
at
most
to
bark
harrowingly
at
them
from
a
safe
distance
again
wolf
had
an
insatiable
craving
to
find
out
for
himself
whether
or
not
everything
on
earth
was
good
to
eat
kipling
writes
of
experiments
in
trying
to
eat
soap
and
blacking
wolf
added
to
this
limited
fare
a
hundred
articles
from
clothespins
to
cigars
the
climax
came
when
he
found
on
the
a
box
of
chocolates
from
which
the
and
gilt
cord
had
not
yet
been
removed
wolf
ate
not
only
all
the
candy
but
the
entire
box
and
the
paper
and
the
string
after
which
he
was
tumultuously
and
horribly
ill
the
foregoing
were
but
a
small
percentage
of
his
gay
sins
and
on
respectable
lad
fell
the
burden
of
making
him
into
a
decent
canine
citizen
lad
himself
had
been
one
of
those
rare
puppies
to
whom
the
law
is
taught
with
bewildering
ease
a
single
command
or
prohibition
had
ever
been
enough
to
fix
a
rule
in
his
almost
uncannily
human
brain
perhaps
if
the
two
little
brown
pups
had
lived
one
or
both
of
them
might
have
taken
after
their
sire
in
character
but
wolf
was
the
true
son
of
temperamental
wilful
lady
and
lad
had
his
job
cut
out
for
him
in
educating
the
puppy
it
was
a
slow
tedious
process
lad
went
at
it
as
he
went
at
everything
with
a
gallant
dash
behind
which
was
an
endless
supply
of
resource
and
endurance
once
for
instance
wolf
leaped
barkingly
upon
a
filmy
square
of
handkerchief
that
had
just
fallen
from
the
belt
before
the
destructive
little
teeth
could
rip
the
fine
cambric
into
rags
the
puppy
found
himself
to
his
amazement
lifted
gently
from
earth
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
held
thus
in
midair
until
he
dropped
the
handkerchief
lad
then
deposited
him
on
the
grass
whereupon
wolf
pounced
once
more
upon
the
handkerchief
only
to
be
lifted
a
second
time
painlessly
but
terrifyingly
above
earth
after
this
was
repeated
five
times
a
gleam
of
sense
entered
the
puppy
and
he
trotted
sulkily
away
leaving
the
handkerchief
untouched
again
when
he
made
a
wild
rush
at
the
friendly
covey
of
peacock
chicks
he
found
he
had
hurled
himself
against
an
object
as
immobile
as
a
stone
wall
lad
had
darted
in
between
the
pup
and
the
chicks
opposing
his
own
big
body
to
the
charge
wolf
was
bowled
clean
over
by
the
force
of
the
impact
and
lay
for
a
minute
on
his
back
the
breath
knocked
clean
out
of
his
bruised
body
it
was
a
longer
but
easier
task
to
teach
him
at
whom
to
bark
and
at
whom
not
to
bark
by
a
sharp
growl
or
a
menacing
curl
of
the
lips
lad
silenced
the
youngster
clamorous
salvo
when
a
guest
or
tradesman
entered
the
place
whether
on
foot
or
in
a
car
by
his
own
thunderously
menacing
bark
he
incited
wolf
to
a
like
outburst
when
some
peddler
or
tramp
sought
to
slouch
down
the
drive
toward
the
house
the
full
tale
of
wolf
education
would
require
many
profitless
pages
in
the
telling
at
times
the
mistress
and
the
master
watching
from
the
sidelines
would
wonder
at
lad
persistency
and
would
despair
of
his
success
yet
bit
by
bit
and
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
for
so
vast
an
undertaking
wolf
character
was
rounded
into
form
true
he
had
the
spirits
of
a
true
puppy
and
these
spirits
sometimes
led
him
to
smash
even
such
sections
of
the
law
as
he
fully
understood
but
he
was
a
thoroughbred
and
the
son
of
clever
parents
so
he
learned
on
the
whole
with
gratifying
speed
far
more
quickly
than
he
could
have
been
taught
by
the
wisest
human
nor
was
his
education
a
matter
of
constant
drudgery
lad
varied
it
by
taking
the
puppy
for
long
runs
in
the
december
woods
and
relaxed
to
the
extent
of
romping
laboriously
with
him
at
times
wolf
grew
to
love
his
sire
as
he
had
never
loved
lady
for
the
discipline
and
the
firm
kindliness
of
lad
were
having
their
effect
on
his
heart
as
well
as
on
his
manners
they
struck
a
far
deeper
note
within
him
than
ever
had
lady
alternating
affection
and
crossness
in
truth
wolf
seemed
to
have
forgotten
lady
but
lad
had
not
every
morning
the
moment
he
was
released
from
the
house
lad
would
trot
over
to
lady
empty
kennel
to
see
if
by
any
chance
she
had
come
back
to
him
during
the
night
there
was
eager
hope
in
his
big
dark
eyes
as
he
hurried
over
to
the
vacant
kennel
there
was
dejection
in
every
line
of
his
body
as
he
turned
away
from
his
hopeless
quest
late
gray
autumn
had
emerged
overnight
into
white
early
winter
the
ground
of
the
place
lay
blanketed
in
snow
the
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
lawn
was
frozen
solid
from
shore
to
shore
the
trees
crouched
away
from
the
whirling
north
wind
as
if
in
shame
at
their
own
black
nakedness
nature
like
the
birds
had
flown
south
leaving
the
northern
world
as
dead
and
as
empty
and
as
cheerless
as
a
deserted
the
puppy
reveled
in
the
snow
he
would
roll
in
it
and
bite
it
barking
all
the
while
in
an
ecstasy
of
excitement
his
coat
was
thicker
and
shaggier
now
to
ward
off
the
stinging
cold
and
the
snow
and
the
roaring
winds
were
his
playfellows
rather
than
his
foes
most
of
all
the
lake
fascinated
him
earlier
when
lad
had
taught
him
to
swim
wolf
had
at
first
shrunk
back
from
the
chilly
black
water
now
to
his
astonishment
he
could
run
on
that
water
as
easily
if
somewhat
sprawlingly
as
on
land
it
was
a
miracle
he
never
tired
of
testing
he
spent
half
his
time
on
the
ice
despite
an
occasional
hard
tumble
or
involuntary
slide
once
and
once
only
in
all
her
absence
and
in
his
own
loneliness
had
lad
discovered
anything
to
remind
him
of
his
lost
mate
and
that
discovery
caused
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
blameless
life
to
break
the
most
sacred
of
the
place
simple
laws
the
inviolable
it
was
on
a
day
in
late
november
a
runabout
came
down
the
drive
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
in
it
rode
the
vet
who
had
taken
lady
away
he
had
stopped
for
a
moment
on
his
way
to
paterson
to
report
as
to
lady
progress
at
his
lad
was
in
the
at
the
time
as
a
maid
answered
the
summons
at
the
door
he
walked
hospitably
forward
to
greet
the
unknown
guest
the
vet
stepped
into
the
room
by
one
door
as
the
master
entered
it
by
the
other
which
was
lucky
for
the
vet
lad
took
one
look
at
the
man
who
had
stolen
lady
then
without
a
sound
or
other
sign
of
warning
he
launched
his
mighty
bulk
straight
at
the
vet
throat
accustomed
though
he
was
to
the
ways
of
dogs
the
vet
had
barely
time
to
brace
himself
and
to
throw
one
arm
in
front
of
his
throat
and
then
lad
eighty
pounds
smote
him
on
the
chest
and
lad
powerful
jaws
closed
viselike
on
the
forearm
that
guarded
the
man
throat
deep
into
the
thick
ulster
the
white
teeth
clove
their
way
through
and
undercoat
sleeve
and
the
sleeves
of
a
linen
shirt
and
of
flannels
clear
through
to
the
flesh
of
the
forearm
shouted
the
master
springing
forward
in
obedience
to
the
sharp
command
lad
loosed
his
grip
and
dropped
to
the
floor
where
he
stood
quivering
with
leashed
fury
through
the
that
swirled
over
his
brain
he
knew
he
had
broken
the
law
he
had
never
merited
punishment
he
did
not
fear
it
but
the
master
tone
of
fierce
disapproval
cut
the
sensitive
dog
soul
more
painfully
than
any
scourge
could
have
cut
his
body
lad
cried
the
master
again
in
rebuking
amazement
the
dog
turned
walked
slowly
over
to
the
master
and
lay
down
at
his
feet
the
master
without
another
word
opened
the
front
door
and
pointed
outward
lad
rose
and
slunk
out
he
had
been
ordered
from
the
house
and
in
a
stranger
presence
he
thinks
i
responsible
for
his
losing
lady
said
the
vet
looking
ruefully
at
his
torn
sleeve
that
why
he
went
for
me
i
do
blame
the
dog
do
lick
him
i
not
going
to
lick
him
growled
the
master
i
as
soon
thrash
a
woman
besides
i
just
punished
him
worse
than
if
i
taken
an
to
him
send
me
a
bill
for
your
coat
in
late
december
came
a
thaw
a
freak
thaw
that
changed
the
white
ground
to
brown
mud
and
rotted
the
smooth
surface
of
the
to
gray
slush
all
day
and
all
night
the
trees
and
the
eaves
sent
forth
a
dreary
it
was
the
traditional
january
thaw
set
forward
a
month
on
the
third
and
last
morning
of
the
thaw
wolf
galloped
down
to
the
lake
as
usual
lad
jogged
along
at
his
side
as
they
reached
the
margin
lad
sniffed
and
drew
back
his
weird
sixth
sense
somehow
told
him
as
it
tells
an
elephant
that
there
was
danger
ahead
wolf
however
was
at
the
stage
of
extreme
youth
when
neither
dogs
nor
humans
are
bothered
by
premonitions
ahead
of
him
stretched
the
huge
sheet
of
ice
whereon
he
loved
to
gambol
straightway
he
frisked
out
upon
it
a
rough
growl
of
warning
from
lad
made
him
look
back
but
the
lure
of
the
ice
was
stronger
than
the
call
of
duty
the
current
at
this
point
of
the
lake
twisted
sharply
landward
in
a
thus
for
a
few
yards
out
the
rotting
ice
was
still
thick
but
where
the
current
ran
it
was
thin
and
as
soggy
as
wet
as
wolf
speedily
discovered
he
bounded
on
the
thinner
ice
driving
his
hind
claws
into
the
slushy
surface
for
his
second
leap
he
was
dismayed
to
find
that
the
ice
collapsed
under
the
pounding
feet
there
was
a
dull
sloppy
sound
a
broke
off
from
the
main
sheet
breaking
at
once
into
a
dozen
smaller
cakes
and
wolf
disappeared
tail
first
into
the
water
beneath
to
the
surface
he
came
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
hole
he
was
mad
clear
through
at
the
prank
his
beloved
lake
had
played
on
him
he
struck
out
for
shore
on
the
landward
side
of
the
opening
his
forefeet
clawed
helplessly
at
the
unbroken
ledge
of
ice
he
had
not
the
strength
or
the
wit
to
crawl
upon
it
and
make
his
way
to
land
the
bitter
chill
of
the
water
was
already
paralyzing
him
the
strong
current
was
tugging
at
his
hindquarters
anger
gave
way
to
panic
the
puppy
wasted
much
of
his
remaining
strength
by
lifting
up
his
voice
in
howls
the
mistress
and
the
master
motoring
into
the
drive
from
the
highway
nearly
a
distant
heard
the
racket
the
lake
was
plainly
visible
to
them
through
the
bare
trees
even
at
that
distance
and
they
took
in
the
impending
tragedy
at
a
glance
they
jumped
out
of
the
car
and
set
off
at
a
run
to
the
the
way
was
long
and
the
ground
was
heavy
with
mud
they
could
not
hope
to
reach
the
lake
before
the
puppy
strength
should
fail
but
lad
was
already
there
at
wolf
first
cry
lad
sprang
out
on
the
ice
that
heaved
and
chucked
and
cracked
under
his
greater
weight
his
rush
carried
him
to
the
very
edge
of
the
hole
and
there
leaning
forward
and
bracing
all
four
of
his
absurdly
tiny
white
paws
he
sought
to
catch
the
puppy
by
the
neck
and
lift
him
to
safety
but
before
his
rescuing
jaws
could
close
on
wolf
fur
the
decayed
ice
gave
way
beneath
his
weight
and
the
hole
was
widened
by
another
twenty
feet
of
water
down
went
lad
with
a
crash
and
up
he
came
in
almost
no
time
a
few
feet
away
from
where
wolf
floundered
helplessly
among
the
chunks
of
drifting
ice
the
breaking
off
of
the
shoreward
mass
of
ice
under
lad
pressure
had
left
the
puppy
with
no
foothold
at
all
it
had
ducked
him
and
had
robbed
him
even
of
the
chance
to
howl
his
mouth
and
throat
full
of
water
wolf
strangled
and
splashed
in
a
delirium
of
terror
lad
struck
out
for
him
butting
aside
the
impending
with
his
great
shoulders
and
swimming
with
a
rush
that
lifted
a
third
of
his
tawny
body
out
of
water
his
jaws
gripped
wolf
by
the
middle
of
the
back
and
he
swam
thus
with
him
toward
shore
at
the
edge
of
the
shoreward
ice
he
gave
a
heave
which
called
on
every
numbing
muscle
of
the
huge
frame
and
which
in
spite
of
the
burden
he
held
again
lifted
his
head
and
shoulders
high
above
water
he
thus
flung
wolf
body
halfway
up
on
the
ledge
of
ice
the
flying
forepaws
chanced
to
strike
the
his
sharp
claws
bit
into
its
soft
upper
crust
with
a
frantic
wriggle
he
was
out
of
the
water
and
on
top
of
this
thicker
stratum
of
and
in
a
second
he
had
regained
shore
and
was
careering
wildly
up
the
lawn
toward
the
greater
safety
of
his
kennel
yet
halfway
in
his
flight
courage
returned
to
the
baby
he
halted
turned
about
and
with
a
volley
of
falsetto
barks
challenged
the
offending
water
to
come
ashore
and
fight
fair
as
wolf
forepaws
had
gripped
the
ice
he
had
further
aided
his
climb
to
safety
by
thrusting
downward
with
his
hind
legs
both
his
hind
paws
had
struck
lad
head
their
thrust
had
driven
lad
clean
under
water
there
the
current
caught
him
when
lad
came
up
it
was
not
to
the
surface
but
under
the
ice
some
yards
below
the
top
of
his
head
struck
stunningly
against
the
underpart
of
the
a
lesser
dog
would
then
and
there
have
given
up
the
struggle
or
else
would
have
thrashed
about
futilely
until
he
drowned
lad
perhaps
on
instinct
perhaps
on
reason
struck
out
toward
the
light
the
spot
where
the
great
hole
had
let
in
sunshine
through
the
gray
the
average
dog
is
not
trained
to
swim
under
water
to
this
day
it
is
a
mystery
how
lad
had
the
sense
to
hold
his
breath
he
fought
his
way
on
inch
by
inch
against
the
current
beneath
the
scratching
rough
of
the
ice
always
toward
the
light
and
just
as
his
lungs
must
have
been
ready
to
burst
he
reached
the
open
space
sputtering
and
panting
lad
made
for
shore
presently
he
reached
the
that
lay
between
him
and
the
bank
he
reached
it
just
as
the
master
squirming
along
face
downward
and
at
full
length
began
to
work
his
way
out
over
the
swaying
toward
him
twice
the
big
dog
raised
himself
almost
to
the
top
of
the
ledge
once
the
ice
broke
under
his
weight
dousing
him
the
second
time
he
got
his
well
over
the
top
of
the
ledge
and
he
was
struggling
upward
with
all
his
tired
body
when
the
master
hand
gripped
his
soaked
ruff
with
this
new
help
lad
made
a
final
struggle
a
struggle
that
laid
him
gasping
but
safe
on
the
slushy
surface
of
the
thicker
ice
backward
over
the
few
yards
that
still
separated
them
from
land
he
and
the
master
crawled
to
the
bank
lad
was
staggering
as
he
started
forward
to
greet
the
mistress
and
his
eyes
were
still
dim
and
bloodshot
from
his
fearful
ordeal
midway
in
his
progress
toward
the
mistress
another
dog
barred
his
path
a
dog
that
fell
upon
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
delighted
welcome
lad
cleared
his
nostrils
for
a
growl
of
protest
he
had
surely
done
quite
enough
for
wolf
this
day
without
the
puppy
trying
to
rob
him
now
of
the
mistress
caress
he
was
tired
and
he
was
dizzy
and
he
wanted
such
petting
and
comfort
and
praise
as
only
the
worshipped
mistress
could
give
impatience
at
the
puppy
interference
cleared
the
haze
a
little
from
lad
brain
and
eyes
he
halted
in
his
shaky
walk
and
stared
dumfounded
this
dog
which
greeted
him
so
rapturously
was
not
wolf
it
was
why
it
was
lady
oh
it
was
we
just
brought
her
back
to
you
old
friend
the
master
was
telling
him
we
went
over
for
her
in
the
car
this
morning
she
all
well
again
and
but
lad
did
not
hear
all
he
realized
all
he
wanted
to
realize
was
that
his
mate
was
ecstatically
nipping
one
of
his
ears
to
make
him
romp
with
her
it
was
a
sharp
nip
and
it
hurt
like
the
very
mischief
lad
loved
to
have
it
hurt
chapter
v
for
a
bit
of
ribbon
lad
had
never
been
in
a
city
or
in
a
crowd
to
him
the
universe
was
bounded
by
the
soft
green
mountains
that
hemmed
in
the
valley
and
the
lake
the
place
stood
on
the
lake
edge
its
meadows
running
back
to
the
forest
there
were
few
houses
nearer
than
the
village
it
was
an
ideal
home
for
such
a
dog
as
lad
even
as
lad
was
an
ideal
dog
for
such
a
home
a
guest
started
all
the
trouble
a
guest
who
spent
a
at
the
place
and
who
loved
dogs
far
better
than
he
understood
them
he
made
much
of
lad
being
in
his
admiration
of
the
stately
collie
lad
endured
the
caresses
when
he
could
not
politely
elude
them
say
announced
the
guest
just
before
he
departed
if
i
had
a
dog
like
lad
i
him
at
the
big
show
at
madison
square
you
know
it
booked
for
next
month
why
not
take
a
chance
and
exhibit
him
there
think
what
it
would
mean
to
you
people
to
have
a
westminster
blue
ribbon
the
big
dog
had
won
why
you
be
as
proud
as
punch
it
was
a
careless
speech
and
well
meant
no
harm
might
have
come
from
it
had
not
the
master
the
next
day
chanced
upon
an
advance
notice
of
the
in
his
morning
paper
he
read
the
proclamation
then
he
remembered
what
the
guest
had
said
the
mistress
was
called
into
consultation
and
it
was
she
as
ever
who
cast
the
deciding
vote
lad
is
twice
as
beautiful
as
any
collie
we
ever
saw
at
the
show
she
declared
and
not
one
of
them
is
half
as
wise
or
good
or
as
he
is
and
a
blue
ribbon
is
the
greatest
honor
a
dog
can
have
i
suppose
it
would
be
something
to
remember
after
which
the
master
wrote
a
letter
to
a
friend
who
kept
a
show
kennel
of
airedales
he
received
this
answer
i
do
pretend
to
know
anything
professionally
about
collies
airedales
being
my
specialty
but
lad
is
a
beauty
as
i
remember
him
and
his
pedigree
shows
a
bunch
of
champions
i
risk
it
if
i
were
you
if
you
are
in
doubt
and
do
want
to
plunge
why
not
just
enter
him
for
the
novice
class
that
is
a
class
for
dogs
that
have
never
before
been
shown
it
will
cost
you
five
dollars
to
enter
him
for
a
single
class
like
that
and
in
the
novice
he
wo
be
up
against
any
champions
or
other
dogs
that
have
already
won
prizes
that
will
make
it
easier
it
is
a
grueling
competition
like
the
or
even
the
if
he
wins
as
a
novice
you
can
enter
him
another
time
in
something
more
important
i
inclosing
an
for
you
to
fill
out
and
send
with
your
to
the
secretary
you
find
his
address
at
the
bottom
of
the
blank
showing
four
of
my
airedales
there
so
we
be
neighbors
thus
encouraged
the
master
filled
in
the
blank
and
sent
it
with
a
check
and
in
due
time
word
was
returned
to
him
that
sunnybank
lad
was
formally
entered
for
the
novice
class
at
the
westminster
kennel
club
annual
show
at
madison
square
garden
by
this
time
both
the
mistress
and
the
master
were
infected
with
the
most
virulent
type
of
the
show
germ
they
talked
of
little
else
than
the
forthcoming
event
they
read
all
the
literature
they
could
lay
hands
on
as
for
lad
he
was
mercifully
ignorant
of
what
was
in
store
for
him
the
mistress
had
an
inkling
of
his
fated
ordeal
when
she
read
the
kennel
club
rule
that
no
dog
could
be
taken
from
the
garden
except
at
stated
times
from
the
moment
the
show
should
begin
at
ten
wednesday
morning
until
the
hour
of
its
close
at
ten
saturday
night
for
twelve
hours
a
day
for
four
consecutive
days
every
entrant
must
be
there
by
paying
a
forfeit
fee
dog
owners
might
take
their
pets
to
some
nearby
hotel
or
stable
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
and
early
morning
a
permission
which
for
obvious
reasons
would
not
affect
most
dogs
but
lad
never
been
away
from
home
a
night
in
his
life
exclaimed
the
mistress
in
dismay
he
be
horribly
lonely
there
all
that
while
especially
at
night
by
this
time
with
the
mysterious
foreknowledge
of
the
best
type
of
thoroughbred
collie
lad
began
to
be
aware
that
something
unusual
had
crept
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
it
made
him
restless
but
he
did
not
associate
it
with
himself
until
the
mistress
took
to
giving
him
daily
baths
and
brushings
always
she
had
brushed
him
once
a
day
to
keep
his
shaggy
coat
fluffy
and
burnished
and
the
lake
had
supplied
him
with
baths
that
made
him
as
clean
as
any
human
but
never
had
he
undergone
such
searching
massage
with
comb
and
brush
as
was
now
his
portion
never
had
he
known
such
scrubbings
as
were
now
his
daily
fate
for
the
week
preceding
the
show
as
a
result
of
these
ministrations
his
wavy
fur
was
like
spun
silk
in
texture
and
it
stood
out
all
over
him
like
the
hair
of
a
circassian
beauty
in
a
dime
museum
the
white
chest
and
forepaws
were
like
snow
and
his
sides
and
broad
back
and
mighty
shoulders
shone
like
dark
bronze
he
was
magnificent
but
he
was
miserable
he
knew
well
enough
now
that
he
was
in
some
way
the
center
of
all
this
unwonted
stir
and
excitement
which
pervaded
the
place
he
loathed
change
of
any
sort
a
thoroughbred
collie
being
ever
an
this
particular
change
seemed
to
threaten
his
peace
also
it
kept
his
skin
scraped
with
combs
and
his
hair
redolent
of
soaps
to
humans
there
was
no
odor
at
all
in
the
naphtha
soap
with
which
the
mistress
lathered
the
dog
and
every
visible
atom
of
it
was
washed
away
at
once
with
warm
water
but
a
human
sense
of
smell
compared
with
the
best
type
of
collie
is
as
a
purblind
puppy
power
of
sight
in
comparison
to
a
hawk
all
over
the
east
during
these
last
days
before
the
show
hundreds
of
dogs
were
undergoing
preparation
for
an
exhibition
which
to
the
beholder
is
a
delight
and
which
to
many
of
the
canine
exhibits
is
a
form
of
unremitting
torture
to
do
justice
to
the
master
and
the
mistress
they
had
no
idea
then
of
this
torture
otherwise
all
the
blue
ribbons
ever
woven
would
not
have
tempted
them
to
subject
their
beloved
chum
to
it
in
some
kennels
airedales
were
plucked
by
hand
to
rid
them
of
the
last
vestige
of
the
soft
gray
outer
coat
which
is
an
airedale
chief
natural
beauty
and
no
hair
of
which
must
be
seen
in
a
show
plucking
a
dog
is
like
pulling
live
hairs
from
a
human
head
so
far
as
the
sensation
goes
but
demand
the
anguish
in
other
kennels
white
coats
were
still
further
whitened
by
the
harsh
rubbing
of
pipeclay
into
the
tender
skin
sensitive
tails
and
still
more
sensitive
ears
were
sandpapered
for
the
victims
greater
beauty
and
agony
also
were
shaved
close
with
murderous
little
were
tearing
blithely
away
at
and
heads
to
barber
natural
furriness
into
painful
and
unnatural
trimness
ears
were
scrunched
until
their
wearers
quivered
with
stark
anguish
to
impart
the
perfect
ordained
by
fashion
for
collies
and
so
on
through
every
breed
to
be
exhibited
each
to
its
own
form
of
torment
torments
compared
to
which
lad
gentle
if
bothersome
brushing
and
bathing
were
a
pure
delight
few
of
these
ruthlessly
prepared
dogs
were
personal
pets
the
bulk
of
them
were
kennel
dogs
dogs
bred
and
raised
after
the
formula
for
raising
and
breeding
prize
hogs
or
chickens
and
with
little
more
of
the
individual
element
in
it
the
dogs
were
bred
in
a
way
to
bring
out
certain
arbitrary
points
which
count
in
and
which
change
from
year
to
year
brain
fidelity
devotion
the
side
of
a
dog
these
were
totally
ignored
in
the
effort
to
breed
the
perfect
physical
animal
the
dogs
were
kept
in
and
in
wire
runs
like
so
many
pedigreed
cattle
looked
after
by
paid
attendants
and
trained
to
do
nothing
but
to
be
the
of
their
kind
and
to
win
ribbons
some
of
them
did
not
know
their
owners
by
sight
having
been
reared
wholly
by
hirelings
the
body
was
everything
the
heart
the
mind
the
namelessly
delightful
quality
of
the
dog
these
were
nothing
such
traits
do
not
win
prizes
at
a
therefore
fanciers
whose
sole
aim
is
to
win
ribbons
and
cups
do
not
bother
to
cultivate
them
all
of
this
is
extraneous
but
may
be
worth
your
remembering
next
time
you
go
to
a
early
on
the
morning
of
the
show
first
day
the
mistress
and
the
master
set
forth
for
town
with
lad
they
went
in
their
little
car
that
the
dog
might
not
risk
the
dirt
and
cinders
of
a
train
lad
refused
to
eat
a
mouthful
of
the
tempting
breakfast
set
before
him
that
day
he
could
not
eat
when
foreboding
was
hot
in
his
throat
he
had
often
ridden
in
the
car
usually
he
enjoyed
the
ride
but
now
he
crawled
rather
than
sprang
into
the
tonneau
all
the
way
up
the
drive
his
great
mournful
eyes
were
turned
back
toward
the
house
in
dumb
appeal
every
atom
of
spirit
and
gayety
and
dash
were
gone
from
him
he
knew
he
was
being
taken
away
from
the
sweet
place
he
loved
and
that
the
car
was
whizzing
him
along
toward
some
dreaded
fate
his
heart
was
sick
within
him
to
the
born
and
bred
this
is
an
everyday
occurrence
painful
but
inevitable
to
a
like
lad
it
is
heartbreaking
the
big
collie
buried
his
head
in
the
mistress
lap
and
crouched
hopelessly
at
her
feet
as
the
car
chugged
cityward
a
thoroughly
unhappy
dog
is
the
most
thoroughly
unhappy
thing
on
earth
all
the
adored
mistress
coaxings
and
pettings
could
not
rouse
lad
from
his
dull
apathy
of
despair
this
was
the
hour
when
he
was
wont
to
make
his
stately
morning
rounds
of
the
place
at
the
heels
of
one
of
his
two
deities
and
now
instead
these
deities
were
carrying
him
away
to
something
direfully
unpleasant
a
lesser
dog
would
have
howled
or
would
have
struggled
crazily
to
break
away
lad
stood
his
ground
like
a
furry
martyr
and
awaited
his
fate
in
an
hour
or
so
the
ride
ended
the
car
drew
up
at
madison
square
beside
the
huge
yellowish
building
arcaded
and
which
goes
by
the
name
of
garden
and
which
is
as
nearly
historic
as
any
landmark
in
feverish
new
york
is
permitted
to
be
ever
since
the
car
had
entered
manhattan
island
unhappy
nostrils
had
been
aquiver
with
a
million
new
and
troublous
odors
now
as
the
car
halted
these
myriad
strange
smells
were
lost
in
one
an
scent
of
dog
to
a
human
out
there
in
the
street
the
scent
was
not
observable
to
a
dog
it
was
overwhelming
lad
at
the
master
word
stepped
down
from
the
tonneau
onto
the
sidewalk
he
stood
there
dazedly
sniffing
the
plangent
roar
of
the
city
was
painful
to
his
ears
which
had
always
been
attuned
to
the
deep
silences
of
forest
and
lake
and
through
this
din
he
caught
the
muffled
noise
of
the
chorused
barks
and
howls
of
many
of
his
own
kind
the
racket
that
bursts
so
deafeningly
on
humans
as
they
enter
the
garden
during
a
was
wholly
audible
to
lad
out
in
the
street
itself
and
as
instinct
or
scent
makes
a
hog
flinch
at
going
into
a
slaughterhouse
so
the
gallant
dog
spirit
quailed
for
a
moment
as
he
followed
the
mistress
and
the
master
into
the
building
a
man
who
is
at
all
familiar
with
the
ways
of
dogs
can
tell
at
once
whether
a
dog
bark
denotes
cheer
or
anger
or
terror
or
grief
or
curiosity
to
such
a
man
a
bark
is
as
expressive
of
meanings
as
are
the
inflections
of
a
human
voice
to
another
dog
these
meanings
are
far
more
intelligible
and
in
the
timbre
of
the
multiple
barks
and
yells
that
now
assailed
his
ears
lad
read
nothing
to
allay
his
own
fears
he
was
the
hero
of
a
fights
he
had
once
risked
his
life
to
save
life
he
had
attacked
tramps
and
peddlers
and
other
invaders
who
had
strayed
into
the
grounds
of
the
place
yet
the
tiniest
semblance
of
fear
now
crept
into
his
heart
he
looked
up
at
the
mistress
a
world
of
sorrowing
appeal
in
his
eyes
at
her
gentle
touch
on
his
head
and
at
a
whisper
of
her
loved
voice
he
moved
onward
at
her
side
with
no
further
hesitation
if
these
his
gods
were
leading
him
to
death
he
would
not
question
their
right
to
do
it
but
would
follow
on
as
befitted
a
good
soldier
through
a
doorway
they
went
at
a
wicket
a
yawning
veterinary
glanced
uninterestedly
at
lad
as
the
dog
had
no
outward
and
glaring
signs
of
disease
the
vet
did
not
so
much
as
touch
him
but
with
a
nod
suffered
him
to
pass
the
vet
was
paid
to
inspect
all
dogs
as
they
entered
the
show
perhaps
some
of
them
were
turned
back
by
him
perhaps
not
but
after
this
as
after
many
another
show
scores
of
kennels
were
swept
by
distemper
and
by
other
canine
maladies
scores
of
deaths
followed
that
is
one
of
the
risks
a
must
take
or
rather
that
his
luckless
dogs
must
take
in
spite
of
the
fees
paid
to
yawning
veterinaries
to
bar
out
sick
entrants
as
lad
passed
in
through
the
doorway
he
halted
involuntarily
in
dismay
dogs
dogs
dogs
more
than
two
thousand
of
them
from
great
dane
to
toy
terrier
benched
in
row
after
row
throughout
the
vast
of
the
garden
lad
had
never
known
there
were
so
many
dogs
on
earth
fully
five
hundred
of
them
were
barking
or
howling
the
hideous
volume
of
sound
swelled
to
the
garden
vaulted
roof
and
echoed
back
again
like
innumerable
upon
the
eardrum
the
mistress
stood
holding
lad
chain
and
softly
caressing
the
bewildered
dog
while
the
master
went
to
make
inquiries
lad
pressed
his
shaggy
body
closer
to
her
knee
for
refuge
as
he
gazed
blinkingly
around
him
in
the
garden
center
were
several
large
inclosures
of
wire
and
reddish
wood
inside
each
inclosure
were
a
table
a
chair
and
a
movable
platform
the
platform
was
some
six
inches
high
and
four
feet
square
at
corners
of
these
were
blackboards
on
which
the
classes
next
to
be
inspected
were
chalked
up
all
around
the
central
space
were
alleys
on
each
side
of
which
were
lines
of
raised
benches
two
feet
from
the
ground
the
benches
were
carpeted
with
straw
and
were
divided
off
by
high
wire
partitions
into
compartments
about
three
feet
in
area
each
compartment
was
to
be
the
of
some
unfortunate
dog
for
the
next
four
days
and
nights
by
short
chains
the
dogs
were
bound
into
these
cells
the
chains
left
their
wearers
just
leeway
enough
to
stand
up
or
lie
down
or
to
move
to
the
various
limits
of
the
tiny
space
in
front
of
some
of
the
compartments
a
wire
barrier
was
fastened
this
meant
that
the
occupant
was
savage
in
other
words
that
under
the
strain
he
was
likely
to
resent
the
stares
or
pokes
or
ticklings
or
promiscuous
alien
pattings
of
fifty
thousand
curious
visitors
the
master
came
back
with
a
plumply
tipped
attendant
lad
was
conducted
through
a
babel
of
yapping
and
snapping
thoroughbreds
of
all
breeds
to
a
section
at
the
garden
northeast
corner
above
which
in
large
black
letters
on
a
white
sign
was
inscribed
collies
here
his
conductors
stopped
before
a
compartment
numbered
up
laddie
said
the
mistress
touching
the
bench
usually
at
this
command
lad
was
wont
to
spring
to
the
indicated
height
whether
or
with
the
lightness
of
a
cat
now
one
foot
after
another
he
very
slowly
climbed
into
the
compartment
he
was
already
beginning
to
detest
the
cell
which
was
planned
to
be
his
only
for
four
interminable
days
there
he
who
had
never
been
tied
was
ignominiously
chained
as
though
he
were
a
runaway
puppy
the
insult
bit
to
the
depths
of
his
sore
soul
he
curled
down
in
the
straw
the
mistress
made
him
as
comfortable
as
she
could
she
set
before
him
the
breakfast
she
had
brought
and
told
the
attendant
to
bring
him
some
water
the
master
meantime
had
met
a
collie
man
whom
he
knew
and
in
company
with
this
acquaintance
he
was
walking
along
the
examining
the
dogs
tied
there
a
dozen
times
had
the
master
visited
but
now
that
lad
was
on
exhibition
he
studied
the
other
collies
with
new
eyes
look
he
said
boastfully
to
his
companion
pausing
before
a
bench
whereon
were
chained
a
dogs
from
a
single
illustrious
kennel
these
fellows
are
in
it
with
old
lad
see
their
noses
are
tapered
like
and
the
span
of
their
heads
between
the
ears
is
as
wide
as
my
palm
and
their
eyes
are
little
and
they
slant
like
a
chinaman
and
their
bodies
are
as
curved
as
a
grayhound
compared
with
lad
some
of
them
are
freaks
that
all
they
are
just
freaks
not
all
of
them
of
course
but
a
lot
of
them
that
the
idea
nowadays
laughed
the
collie
man
patronizingly
the
collie
this
year
style
at
least
is
bred
with
a
borzoi
wolfhound
head
and
with
graceful
small
bones
what
the
use
of
his
having
brain
and
he
used
for
exhibition
or
kept
as
a
pet
nowadays
not
to
herd
sheep
long
nose
narrow
head
but
lad
once
tracked
my
footsteps
two
miles
through
a
snowstorm
bragged
the
master
and
again
on
a
road
where
fifty
people
had
walked
since
i
had
and
he
understands
the
meaning
of
every
simple
word
he
yes
said
the
collie
man
quite
unimpressed
very
interesting
but
not
useful
in
a
show
some
of
the
big
exhibitors
still
care
for
sense
in
their
dogs
and
they
make
companions
of
them
eileen
moretta
for
instance
and
fred
leighton
and
one
or
two
more
but
i
find
most
of
the
rest
are
just
out
for
the
prizes
let
have
a
look
at
your
dog
where
is
he
on
the
way
down
the
alley
toward
cell
they
met
the
worried
mistress
lad
wo
eat
a
thing
she
reported
and
he
would
eat
before
we
left
home
this
morning
either
he
drinks
plenty
of
water
but
he
wo
eat
i
afraid
he
sick
they
hardly
ever
eat
at
a
show
the
collie
man
consoled
her
hardly
a
mouthful
most
of
the
ones
but
they
drink
quarts
of
water
this
is
your
dog
hey
he
broke
off
pausing
at
h
he
stood
legs
apart
hands
behind
his
back
gazing
down
at
lad
the
dog
was
lying
head
between
paws
as
before
he
did
not
so
much
as
glance
up
at
the
stranger
but
his
great
wistful
eyes
roved
from
the
mistress
to
the
master
and
back
again
in
all
this
horrible
place
they
two
alone
were
his
salvation
h
repeated
the
collie
man
thoughtfully
eyes
too
big
and
not
enough
slanted
head
too
thick
for
length
of
nose
ears
too
far
apart
eyes
too
far
apart
too
not
enough
expression
in
them
too
much
bone
too
much
bulk
wonderful
coat
though
glorious
coat
best
coat
i
seen
this
five
years
great
brush
too
what
he
entered
for
novice
hey
may
get
a
third
with
him
at
that
he
the
true
type
but
i
afraid
he
too
for
such
fast
company
as
he
in
still
you
never
can
tell
only
it
a
pity
he
is
a
little
more
i
would
have
him
one
bit
different
in
any
way
flashed
the
mistress
he
perfect
as
he
is
you
ca
see
that
though
because
he
is
himself
now
i
never
seen
him
so
crushed
and
i
wish
we
had
never
brought
him
here
you
ca
blame
him
said
the
collie
man
philosophically
why
just
suppose
were
brought
to
a
strange
place
like
this
and
chained
into
a
cage
and
were
left
there
four
days
and
nights
while
hundreds
of
other
prisoners
kept
screaming
and
shouting
and
crying
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
every
minute
of
the
time
and
suppose
about
a
hundred
thousand
people
kept
jostling
past
your
cage
night
and
day
rubbering
at
you
and
pointing
at
you
and
trying
to
feel
your
ears
and
mouth
and
chirping
at
you
to
shake
hands
would
feel
very
hungry
or
very
chipper
a
show
is
the
most
fearful
thing
a
dog
can
go
through
next
to
vivisection
a
little
show
for
about
eight
hours
is
no
special
ordeal
especially
if
the
dog
master
stays
near
him
all
the
time
but
a
show
is
is
sheol
i
wonder
the
does
do
something
to
make
it
easier
if
i
known
if
we
known
began
the
mistress
most
of
these
folks
know
returned
the
collie
man
they
do
it
year
after
year
there
a
mighty
strong
lure
in
a
bit
of
ribbon
why
look
what
an
exhibitor
will
do
for
it
he
risk
his
dog
health
and
make
his
dog
life
a
horror
he
ship
him
a
thousand
miles
in
a
tight
crate
from
show
to
show
some
dogs
die
under
the
strain
of
so
many
journeys
and
he
pay
five
dollars
for
every
class
the
entered
in
some
exhibitors
enter
a
single
dog
in
five
or
six
classes
the
association
charges
one
dollar
admission
to
the
show
crowds
of
people
pay
the
price
to
come
in
the
exhibitor
gets
none
of
the
all
he
gets
for
his
five
dollars
or
his
dollars
is
an
off
chance
at
a
measly
scrap
of
colored
silk
worth
maybe
four
cents
that
and
the
same
at
a
tiny
cash
prize
that
does
come
anywhere
near
to
paying
his
expenses
yet
for
all
the
straightest
sport
on
earth
not
an
atom
of
graft
in
it
and
seldom
any
profit
so
long
i
wish
you
folks
luck
with
he
strolled
on
the
mistress
was
winking
very
fast
and
was
bending
over
lad
petting
him
and
whispering
to
him
the
master
looked
in
curiosity
at
a
kennel
man
who
was
holding
down
a
nearby
collie
while
a
second
man
was
trimming
the
scared
dog
feet
and
fetlocks
with
a
pair
of
curved
shears
and
now
the
master
noted
that
nearly
every
dog
but
lad
was
thus
clipped
as
to
ankle
at
an
adjoining
cell
a
woman
was
sifting
almost
a
pound
of
talcum
powder
into
her
dog
fur
to
make
the
coat
fluffier
elsewhere
similar
weird
preparations
were
in
progress
and
lad
only
preparation
had
been
baths
and
brushing
the
master
began
to
feel
like
a
fool
people
all
along
the
collie
line
presently
began
to
brush
dogs
smoothing
the
fur
the
wrong
way
to
fluff
it
and
to
put
other
finishing
touches
on
the
poor
beasts
the
collie
man
strolled
back
to
the
novice
class
in
collies
is
going
to
be
called
presently
he
told
the
mistress
where
your
and
help
you
put
them
on
why
we
only
this
chain
said
the
mistress
we
bought
it
for
lad
yesterday
and
this
is
his
regular
collar
though
he
never
has
had
to
wear
it
do
we
have
to
have
another
kind
you
do
have
to
unless
you
want
to
said
the
collie
man
but
best
especially
the
you
see
when
exhibitors
go
into
the
ring
they
hold
their
dogs
by
the
leash
close
to
the
neck
and
if
their
dogs
have
why
then
they
to
hold
their
heads
high
when
the
leash
is
pulled
they
got
to
to
keep
from
strangling
it
gives
them
a
fine
proud
carriage
of
the
head
that
counts
a
lot
with
some
judges
all
are
taken
that
way
then
the
leash
is
blotted
out
of
the
negative
makes
the
dog
look
showy
too
keeps
him
from
slumping
ca
slump
much
when
you
trying
not
to
choke
you
know
it
horrible
shuddered
the
mistress
i
would
put
such
a
thing
on
lad
for
all
the
prizes
on
earth
when
i
read
wonderful
sinister
story
i
thought
were
a
real
treat
to
dogs
i
see
now
they
your
class
is
called
interrupted
the
collie
man
keep
his
head
high
keep
him
moving
as
showily
as
you
can
lead
him
close
to
you
with
the
chain
as
short
as
possible
do
be
scared
if
any
of
the
other
dogs
in
the
ring
happen
to
fly
at
him
the
attendants
will
look
out
for
all
that
good
luck
down
the
aisle
and
to
the
wired
gate
of
the
ring
the
unhappy
mistress
piloted
the
unhappier
lad
the
big
dog
gravely
kept
beside
her
regardless
of
other
collies
moving
in
the
same
direction
the
garden
had
begun
to
fill
with
visitors
and
the
ring
was
surrounded
with
interested
the
collie
classes
as
usual
were
among
those
to
be
judged
on
the
first
day
of
the
four
through
the
gate
into
the
ring
the
mistress
piloted
lad
six
other
novice
dogs
were
already
there
beautiful
creatures
they
were
and
all
but
one
were
led
by
kennel
men
at
the
table
behind
a
ledger
flanked
by
piles
of
multicolored
ribbons
sat
the
clerk
beside
the
platform
stood
a
wizened
and
elderly
little
man
in
tweeds
he
was
mcgilead
who
had
been
chosen
as
judge
for
the
collie
division
he
was
a
scot
and
he
was
also
a
man
with
stubborn
opinions
of
his
own
as
to
dogs
around
the
ring
at
the
judge
order
the
novice
collies
were
paraded
most
of
them
stepped
high
and
fast
and
carried
their
heads
proudly
aloft
the
thin
cutting
deep
into
their
furry
necks
one
entered
was
a
puppy
who
writhed
and
bit
and
whirled
about
in
ecstasy
of
terror
lad
moved
solemnly
along
at
the
mistress
side
he
did
not
pant
or
curvet
or
look
showy
he
was
miserable
and
every
line
of
his
splendid
body
showed
his
misery
the
mistress
too
glancing
at
the
more
spectacular
dogs
wanted
to
cry
not
because
she
was
about
to
lose
but
because
lad
was
about
to
lose
her
heart
ached
for
him
again
she
blamed
herself
bitterly
for
bringing
him
here
mcgilead
hands
in
pockets
stood
sucking
at
an
empty
brier
pipe
and
scanning
the
parade
that
circled
around
him
presently
he
stepped
up
to
the
mistress
checked
her
as
she
filed
past
him
and
said
to
her
with
a
sort
of
sorrowful
kindness
please
take
your
dog
over
to
the
far
end
of
the
ring
take
him
into
the
corner
where
he
wo
be
in
my
way
while
i
am
judging
yes
he
spoke
courteously
enough
but
the
mistress
would
rather
have
had
him
hit
her
across
the
face
meekly
she
obeyed
his
command
across
the
ring
to
the
very
farthest
corner
she
went
poor
beautiful
lad
beside
her
disgraced
weeded
out
of
the
competition
at
the
very
start
there
far
out
of
the
contest
she
stood
a
drooping
little
figure
feeling
as
though
everyone
were
sneering
at
her
dear
disgrace
lad
seemed
to
sense
her
sorrow
for
as
he
stood
beside
her
head
and
tail
low
he
whined
softly
and
licked
her
hand
as
if
in
encouragement
she
ran
her
fingers
along
his
silky
head
then
to
keep
from
crying
she
watched
the
other
contestants
no
longer
were
these
parading
one
at
a
time
and
then
in
twos
the
judge
was
standing
them
on
the
platform
he
looked
at
their
teeth
he
pressed
their
heads
between
his
hands
he
hefted
their
hips
he
ran
his
fingers
through
their
coats
he
pressed
his
palm
upward
against
their
underbodies
he
subjected
them
to
a
score
of
such
annoyances
but
he
did
it
all
with
a
quick
and
sure
touch
that
not
even
the
crankiest
of
them
could
resent
then
he
stepped
back
and
studied
the
quartet
after
that
he
seemed
to
remember
lad
presence
and
as
though
by
way
of
earning
his
fee
he
slouched
across
the
ring
to
where
the
forlorn
mistress
was
petting
her
dear
disgraced
dog
lazily
perfunctorily
the
judge
ran
his
hand
over
lad
with
absolutely
none
of
the
thoroughness
that
had
marked
his
inspection
of
the
other
dogs
apparently
there
was
no
need
to
look
for
the
finer
points
in
a
disqualified
collie
the
sketchy
examination
did
not
last
three
seconds
at
its
end
the
judge
jotted
down
a
number
on
a
pad
he
held
then
he
laid
one
hand
heavily
on
lad
head
and
curtly
thrust
out
his
other
hand
at
the
mistress
can
i
take
him
away
now
she
asked
still
stroking
lad
fur
yes
rasped
the
judge
and
take
this
along
with
him
in
his
outstretched
hand
fluttered
a
little
bunch
of
silk
dark
blue
with
gold
lettering
on
it
the
blue
ribbon
first
prize
in
the
novice
class
and
this
grouchy
little
judge
was
awarding
it
to
the
mistress
looked
very
hard
at
the
bit
of
blue
and
gold
in
her
fingers
she
saw
it
through
a
queer
mist
then
as
she
stooped
to
fasten
it
to
lad
collar
she
furtively
kissed
the
tiny
white
spot
on
the
top
of
his
head
it
something
like
the
sinister
victory
after
all
she
exclaimed
joyously
as
she
rejoined
the
delighted
master
at
the
ring
gate
but
oh
it
was
terrible
for
a
minute
or
two
was
it
now
angus
mcgilead
esq
late
of
linlithgow
scotland
had
a
knowledge
of
collies
such
as
is
granted
to
few
men
and
this
very
fact
made
him
a
wretchedly
bad
judge
as
the
kennel
club
which
on
the
strength
of
his
fame
had
engaged
his
services
for
this
single
occasion
speedily
learned
the
greatest
lawyer
makes
often
the
worst
judge
legal
annals
prove
this
and
the
same
thing
applies
to
they
are
sane
rather
than
judicial
mcgilead
had
scant
patience
with
the
inbred
and
grayhoundlike
collies
which
had
so
utterly
departed
from
their
ancestral
standards
at
one
glimpse
he
had
recognized
lad
as
a
dog
after
his
own
heart
a
dog
that
brought
back
to
him
the
murk
and
magic
of
the
highland
moors
he
had
noted
the
deep
chest
the
mighty
forequarters
the
tiny
white
paws
the
incredible
wealth
of
and
the
brush
the
grand
head
and
the
soul
in
the
eyes
this
was
such
a
dog
as
mcgilead
shepherd
ancestors
had
admitted
as
an
honored
equal
at
hearth
and
board
such
a
dog
for
brain
and
brawn
and
beauty
as
a
highland
master
would
no
sooner
sell
than
he
would
sell
his
own
child
mcgilead
therefore
had
waved
lad
aside
while
he
judged
the
lesser
dogs
of
his
class
lest
he
be
tempted
to
look
too
much
at
lad
and
too
little
at
them
and
he
rejoiced
at
the
last
to
give
honor
where
all
honor
was
due
through
dreary
hours
that
day
lad
lay
disconsolate
in
his
cell
nose
between
paws
while
the
stream
of
visitors
flowed
sluggishly
past
him
his
memory
of
the
prevented
him
from
showing
his
teeth
when
some
of
these
passing
humans
paused
in
front
of
the
compartment
to
pat
him
or
to
consult
his
number
in
their
catalogues
but
he
accorded
not
so
much
as
one
look
to
say
nothing
of
a
handshake
to
any
of
them
a
single
drop
of
happiness
was
in
his
he
had
seemingly
done
something
that
made
both
the
master
and
the
mistress
very
proud
of
him
he
did
not
know
just
why
they
should
be
for
he
had
done
nothing
clever
in
fact
he
had
been
at
his
dullest
but
they
proud
of
him
undeniably
proud
and
this
made
him
glad
through
all
his
black
despondency
even
the
collie
man
seemed
to
regard
him
with
more
approval
than
before
not
that
lad
cared
at
all
and
two
or
three
exhibitors
came
over
for
a
special
look
at
him
from
one
of
these
exhibitors
the
mistress
learned
of
a
rule
that
was
wholly
new
to
her
she
was
told
that
the
winning
dog
of
each
and
every
class
was
obliged
to
return
later
to
the
ring
to
compete
in
what
was
known
as
the
winners
class
a
contest
whose
entrants
included
every
from
novice
to
open
briefly
this
special
competition
was
to
determine
which
was
the
best
collie
in
the
whole
list
of
winners
and
as
such
entitled
to
a
certain
number
of
points
toward
a
championship
there
were
eight
of
these
winners
one
or
two
such
champions
as
grey
mist
and
southport
sample
were
in
the
show
for
exhibition
only
but
the
pick
of
the
remaining
leaders
must
compete
in
the
winners
class
sunnybank
lad
among
them
the
master
heart
sank
at
this
news
i
sorry
he
said
you
see
it
one
thing
to
win
as
a
novice
against
a
bunch
of
untried
dogs
and
quite
another
to
compete
against
the
best
dogs
in
the
show
i
wish
we
could
get
out
of
it
never
mind
answered
the
mistress
laddie
has
won
his
ribbon
they
ca
take
that
away
from
him
there
a
silver
cup
for
the
class
though
i
wish
there
had
been
one
for
the
novices
the
day
wore
on
at
last
came
the
call
for
winners
and
for
the
second
time
poor
lad
plodded
reluctantly
into
the
ring
with
the
mistress
but
now
instead
of
novice
dogs
he
was
confronted
by
the
cream
of
colliedom
lad
heartsick
aspect
showed
the
more
intensely
in
such
company
it
grieved
the
mistress
bitterly
to
see
his
disconsolate
air
she
thought
of
the
three
days
and
nights
to
come
the
nights
when
she
and
the
master
could
not
be
with
him
when
he
must
lie
listening
to
the
babel
of
yells
and
barks
all
around
with
nobody
to
speak
to
him
except
some
neglectful
and
sleepy
attendant
and
for
the
sake
of
a
blue
ribbon
she
had
brought
this
upon
him
the
mistress
came
to
a
sudden
and
highly
unsportsmanlike
resolution
again
the
dogs
paraded
the
ring
again
the
judge
studied
them
from
between
eyes
but
this
time
he
did
not
wave
lad
to
one
side
the
mistress
had
noted
during
the
day
that
mcgilead
had
always
made
known
his
decisions
by
first
laying
his
hand
on
the
victor
head
and
she
watched
breathless
for
such
a
gesture
one
by
one
the
dogs
were
weeded
out
until
only
two
remained
of
these
two
one
was
lad
the
mistress
heart
banged
crazily
and
the
other
was
champion
coldstream
guard
the
champion
was
a
grand
dog
of
hue
perfect
of
coat
and
line
combining
all
that
was
best
in
the
old
and
new
styles
of
collies
he
carried
his
head
nobly
aloft
with
no
help
from
the
his
tulip
ears
hung
at
precisely
the
right
curve
lad
and
coldstream
guard
were
placed
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
platform
even
the
mistress
could
not
fail
to
contrast
her
aspect
with
the
champion
alert
beauty
lad
she
said
very
low
and
speaking
with
slow
intentness
as
mcgilead
compared
the
two
laddie
we
going
home
home
lad
home
at
the
word
a
thrill
went
through
the
great
dog
his
shoulders
squared
up
went
his
head
and
his
ears
his
dark
eyes
fairly
glowed
with
eagerness
as
he
looked
expectantly
up
at
the
mistress
yet
despite
the
transformation
the
other
was
the
finer
dog
from
a
mere
show
viewpoint
the
mistress
could
see
he
was
even
the
new
uptilt
of
lad
ears
could
not
make
those
ears
so
perfect
in
shape
and
attitude
as
were
the
champion
with
almost
a
gesture
of
regret
mcgilead
laid
his
hand
athwart
coldstream
guard
head
the
mistress
read
the
verdict
and
she
accepted
it
come
laddie
dear
she
said
tenderly
you
second
anyway
that
wait
snapped
mcgilead
the
judge
was
seizing
one
of
champion
coldstream
guard
supershapely
ears
and
turning
it
backward
his
sensitive
fingers
falling
on
the
dog
head
in
token
of
victory
had
encountered
an
odd
stiffness
in
the
curve
of
the
ear
now
he
began
to
examine
that
ear
and
then
the
other
and
thereby
he
disclosed
a
most
clever
bit
of
surgical
bandaging
neatly
crisscrossed
inside
each
of
the
champion
ears
was
a
succession
of
strips
cut
thin
and
running
from
tip
to
orifice
the
scientific
applying
of
these
strips
had
painfully
imparted
to
the
the
dog
one
flaw
the
perfect
so
desirable
as
a
champion
coldstream
guard
silken
ears
could
not
have
had
other
than
ideal
shape
and
posture
if
he
had
wanted
them
to
while
that
crisscross
of
sticky
strips
held
them
in
position
now
this
was
no
new
trick
the
ruse
that
the
champion
handlers
had
employed
again
and
again
in
it
had
been
employed
upon
a
year
or
two
ago
a
woman
was
ordered
from
the
ring
at
the
garden
when
plaster
was
found
inside
her
terrier
ears
but
seldom
before
had
it
been
detected
in
a
collie
in
which
a
usually
counts
as
a
fatal
blemish
mcgilead
looked
at
the
champion
long
and
searchingly
he
looked
at
the
man
who
held
the
champion
leash
and
who
fidgeted
grinningly
under
the
judge
glare
then
mcgilead
laid
both
hands
on
lad
great
honest
head
almost
as
in
benediction
your
dog
wins
madam
he
said
and
while
it
is
no
part
of
a
duty
to
say
so
i
am
heartily
glad
i
wo
insult
you
by
asking
if
he
is
for
sale
but
if
ever
you
have
to
part
with
him
he
did
not
finish
but
abruptly
gave
the
mistress
the
winning
class
rosette
and
now
as
lad
left
the
ring
hundreds
of
hands
were
put
out
to
pat
him
all
at
once
he
was
a
celebrity
without
returning
the
dog
to
the
bench
the
mistress
went
directly
to
the
collie
man
when
do
they
present
the
cups
she
asked
not
until
saturday
night
i
believe
said
the
man
i
congratulate
you
both
on
in
order
to
win
his
cup
lad
will
have
to
stay
in
this
this
inferno
for
three
days
and
nights
longer
of
course
all
the
dogs
if
he
does
stay
he
wo
get
the
cup
no
it
would
go
to
the
reserve
i
suppose
or
to
good
declared
the
mistress
in
relief
then
he
wo
be
defrauding
anyone
and
they
ca
rob
him
of
his
two
ribbons
because
i
have
those
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
puzzled
collie
man
but
the
master
understood
and
approved
good
he
said
i
wanted
all
day
to
suggest
it
to
you
but
i
have
the
nerve
come
around
to
the
exhibitors
entrance
i
go
ahead
and
start
the
car
but
what
the
idea
queried
the
collie
man
in
bewilderment
the
idea
replied
the
mistress
is
that
the
cup
can
go
to
any
dog
that
wants
it
lad
coming
he
knows
it
too
just
look
at
him
i
promised
him
he
should
go
home
we
can
get
there
by
and
he
has
a
day
fast
to
make
up
for
but
expostulated
the
scandalized
collie
man
if
you
withdraw
your
dog
like
that
the
association
will
never
allow
you
to
exhibit
him
at
its
shows
again
the
association
can
have
a
pretty
silver
cup
retorted
the
mistress
to
console
it
for
losing
lad
as
for
exhibiting
him
again
well
i
would
lose
these
two
ribbons
for
a
hundred
dollars
but
i
put
my
worst
enemy
dog
to
the
torture
of
winning
them
over
again
for
a
thousand
come
along
lad
we
going
back
home
at
the
lad
broke
silence
for
the
first
time
in
all
that
vilely
wretched
day
he
broke
it
with
a
series
of
thunderously
trumpeting
barks
that
quite
put
to
shame
the
puny
efforts
of
every
other
dog
in
the
show
chapter
vi
lost
four
of
us
were
discussing
abstract
themes
idly
as
men
will
after
a
good
dinner
and
in
front
of
a
fire
someone
asked
what
is
the
saddest
sight
in
everyday
life
i
do
mean
the
most
gloomily
tragic
but
the
saddest
a
frivolous
member
of
the
fireside
group
cited
a
helpless
man
between
two
quarreling
women
a
sentimentalist
said
a
lost
child
in
a
city
street
the
contradicted
a
lost
in
a
city
street
nobody
agreed
with
him
of
course
but
that
was
because
none
of
the
others
chanced
to
know
dogs
to
know
their
psychology
their
souls
if
you
prefer
the
was
right
a
lost
dog
in
a
city
street
is
the
very
saddest
and
most
hopeless
sight
in
all
a
city
street
abounding
everyday
sadness
a
man
between
two
quarreling
women
is
an
object
piteous
enough
heaven
knows
yet
his
plight
verges
too
much
on
the
grotesque
to
be
called
sad
a
lost
child
no
let
a
child
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
crowded
sidewalk
and
begin
to
cry
in
one
minute
fifty
amateur
and
professional
rescuers
have
flocked
to
the
lost
one
aid
an
hour
at
most
suffices
to
bring
it
in
touch
with
its
frenzied
guardians
a
lost
dog
yes
no
succoring
cohort
surges
to
the
relief
a
gang
of
boys
perhaps
may
give
chase
but
assuredly
not
in
kindness
a
policeman
seeking
a
record
for
mad
dog
shooting
a
professional
in
quest
of
his
dirty
fee
these
will
show
marked
attention
to
the
wanderer
but
again
not
in
kindness
a
dog
at
some
turn
in
the
street
misses
his
master
doubles
back
to
where
the
human
demigod
was
last
seen
darts
ahead
once
more
to
find
him
through
the
press
of
other
human
folk
halts
hesitates
begins
the
same
maneuvers
all
over
again
then
stands
shaking
in
panic
at
his
utter
aloneness
get
the
look
in
his
eyes
then
you
who
do
not
mind
seeing
such
things
and
answer
honestly
is
there
anything
sadder
on
earth
all
this
before
the
pursuit
of
boys
and
the
fever
of
thirst
and
the
final
knowledge
of
desolation
have
turned
him
from
a
handsome
and
prideful
pet
into
a
slinking
outcast
yes
a
lost
dog
is
the
saddest
thing
that
can
meet
the
gaze
of
a
man
or
woman
who
understands
dogs
as
perhaps
my
story
may
help
to
show
or
perhaps
not
lad
had
been
brushed
and
bathed
daily
for
a
week
until
his
coat
shone
all
this
at
the
place
far
up
in
the
north
jersey
hinterland
and
all
to
make
him
presentable
for
the
westminster
kennel
show
at
new
york
madison
square
garden
after
which
his
two
gods
the
mistress
and
the
master
took
him
for
a
ride
in
the
place
only
car
one
morning
the
drive
began
at
the
place
the
domain
where
lad
had
ruled
as
king
among
the
lesser
folk
for
so
many
years
it
ended
at
madison
square
garden
where
the
annual
dog
show
was
in
progress
you
have
read
how
lad
fared
at
that
show
how
at
the
close
of
the
first
day
when
he
had
two
victories
to
his
credit
the
mistress
had
taken
pity
on
his
misery
and
had
decreed
that
he
should
be
taken
home
without
waiting
out
the
remaining
three
days
of
the
master
went
out
first
to
get
the
car
and
bring
it
around
to
the
side
exit
of
the
garden
the
mistress
gathered
up
belongings
his
brush
his
dog
biscuits
and
followed
with
lad
himself
out
of
the
huge
building
with
its
reverberating
barks
and
yells
from
two
thousand
canine
throats
she
went
lad
paced
happy
and
majestic
at
her
side
he
knew
he
was
going
home
and
the
unhappiness
of
the
hideous
day
dropped
from
him
at
the
exit
the
mistress
was
forced
to
leave
a
deposit
of
five
dollars
to
insure
the
return
of
the
dog
to
his
bench
to
which
bench
of
agony
she
vowed
secretly
lad
should
never
return
then
she
was
told
the
law
demands
that
all
dogs
in
new
york
city
streets
shall
be
muzzled
in
vain
she
explained
that
lad
would
be
in
the
streets
only
for
such
brief
time
as
the
car
would
require
to
journey
to
the
one
hundred
and
thirtieth
street
ferry
the
door
attendant
insisted
that
the
law
was
inexorable
so
lest
a
policeman
hold
up
the
car
for
such
disobedience
to
the
city
statutes
the
mistress
reluctantly
bought
a
muzzle
it
was
a
big
awkward
thing
made
of
steel
and
bound
on
with
leather
straps
it
looked
like
a
and
it
fenced
in
the
nose
and
mouth
of
its
owner
with
a
wicked
of
shiny
metal
bars
never
in
all
his
years
had
lad
worn
a
muzzle
never
until
had
he
been
chained
the
splendid
collie
had
been
as
free
of
the
place
and
of
the
forests
as
any
human
and
with
no
worse
restrictions
than
his
own
soul
and
conscience
put
upon
him
to
him
this
muzzle
was
a
horror
not
even
the
loved
touch
of
the
mistress
dear
fingers
as
she
adjusted
the
thing
to
his
beautiful
head
could
lessen
the
degradation
and
the
discomfort
of
it
a
discomfort
that
amounted
to
actual
pain
was
almost
as
bad
as
the
humiliation
with
his
absurdly
tiny
white
forepaws
the
huge
dog
sought
to
dislodge
the
he
strove
to
rub
it
off
against
the
skirt
but
beyond
shifting
it
so
that
the
forehead
strap
covered
one
of
his
eyes
he
could
not
budge
it
lad
looked
up
at
the
mistress
in
wretched
appeal
his
look
held
no
resentment
nothing
but
sad
entreaty
she
was
his
deity
all
his
life
she
had
given
him
of
her
gentleness
her
affection
her
sweet
understanding
yet
she
had
brought
him
to
this
abode
of
noisy
torment
and
had
kept
him
there
from
morning
to
dusk
and
now
just
as
the
vigil
seemed
ended
she
was
tormenting
him
to
by
this
contraption
she
had
fastened
over
his
nose
lad
did
not
rebel
but
he
besought
and
the
mistress
understood
laddie
dear
she
whispered
as
she
led
him
across
the
sidewalk
to
the
curb
where
the
master
waited
for
the
car
laddie
old
friend
i
just
as
sorry
about
it
as
you
are
but
it
only
for
a
few
minutes
just
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
ferry
we
take
it
off
and
throw
it
into
the
river
and
we
never
bring
you
again
where
dogs
have
to
wear
such
things
i
promise
it
only
for
a
few
minutes
the
mistress
for
once
was
mistaken
lad
was
to
wear
the
accursed
muzzle
for
much
longer
than
a
few
minutes
give
him
the
back
seat
to
himself
and
come
in
front
here
with
me
suggested
the
master
as
the
mistress
and
lad
arrived
alongside
the
car
the
poor
old
chap
has
been
so
cramped
up
and
pestered
all
day
that
he
like
to
have
a
whole
seat
to
stretch
out
on
accordingly
the
mistress
opened
the
door
and
motioned
lad
to
the
back
seat
at
a
bound
the
collie
was
on
the
cushion
and
proceeded
to
curl
up
thereon
the
mistress
got
into
the
front
seat
with
the
master
the
car
set
forth
on
its
run
to
the
ferry
now
that
his
face
was
turned
homeward
lad
might
have
found
vast
interest
in
his
new
surroundings
had
not
the
horrible
muzzle
absorbed
all
his
powers
of
emotion
the
milan
cathedral
the
taj
mahal
the
valley
of
the
arno
at
sunset
these
be
sights
to
dream
of
for
years
but
show
them
to
a
man
who
has
an
ulcerated
tooth
or
whose
tight
new
shoes
pinch
his
soft
corn
and
he
will
probably
regard
them
as
lad
just
then
viewed
the
twilight
new
york
streets
he
was
a
dog
of
forest
and
lake
and
hill
this
giant
collie
with
his
mighty
shoulders
and
tiny
white
feet
and
shaggy
burnished
coat
and
mournful
eyes
never
before
had
he
been
in
a
city
the
myriad
blended
noises
confused
and
deafened
him
the
myriad
blended
smells
assailed
his
keen
nostrils
the
swirl
of
countless
multicolored
lights
stung
and
blurred
his
vision
noises
smells
and
lights
were
all
jarringly
new
to
him
so
were
the
jostling
masses
of
people
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
tangle
and
hustle
of
vehicular
traffic
through
which
the
master
was
threading
the
car
way
with
such
difficulty
but
newest
and
most
sickening
of
all
the
day
novelties
was
the
muzzle
lad
was
quite
certain
the
mistress
did
not
realize
how
the
muzzle
was
hurting
him
nor
how
he
detested
it
in
all
her
dealings
with
him
or
with
anyone
or
anything
else
the
mistress
had
never
been
unkind
and
most
assuredly
not
cruel
it
must
be
she
did
not
understand
at
all
events
she
had
not
scolded
or
forbidden
when
he
had
tried
to
rub
the
muzzle
off
so
the
wearing
of
this
new
torture
was
apparently
no
part
of
the
law
and
lad
felt
justified
in
striving
again
to
remove
it
in
vain
he
pawed
the
thing
first
with
one
foot
then
with
both
he
could
joggle
it
from
side
to
side
but
that
was
all
and
each
shift
of
the
steel
bars
hurt
his
tender
nose
and
tenderer
sensibilities
worse
than
the
one
before
he
tried
to
rub
it
off
against
the
seat
cushion
with
the
same
distressing
result
lad
looked
up
at
the
backs
of
his
gods
and
whined
very
softly
the
sound
went
unheard
in
the
babel
of
noise
all
around
him
nor
did
the
mistress
or
the
master
turn
around
on
general
principles
to
speak
a
word
of
cheer
to
the
sufferer
they
were
in
a
mixup
of
crossways
traffic
that
called
for
every
atom
of
their
attention
if
they
were
to
avoid
collision
it
was
no
time
for
conversation
or
for
lad
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
uncertainly
on
the
slippery
leather
cushion
seeking
to
maintain
his
balance
while
he
rubbed
a
corner
of
the
muzzle
against
one
of
the
supports
of
the
car
lowered
top
working
away
with
all
his
might
he
sought
to
get
leverage
that
would
pry
loose
the
muzzle
just
then
there
was
a
brief
gap
in
the
traffic
the
master
put
on
speed
and
darting
ahead
of
a
delivery
truck
sharply
rounded
the
corner
into
a
side
street
the
car
sudden
twist
threw
lad
clean
off
his
precarious
balance
on
the
seat
and
hurled
him
against
one
of
the
rear
doors
the
door
insecurely
shut
could
not
withstand
the
impact
it
burst
open
and
lad
was
flung
out
onto
the
greasy
asphalt
of
the
avenue
he
landed
full
on
his
side
in
the
muck
of
the
roadway
with
a
force
that
shook
the
breath
clean
out
of
him
directly
above
his
head
glared
the
twin
lights
of
the
delivery
truck
the
master
had
just
shot
past
the
truck
was
going
at
a
good
twelve
miles
an
hour
and
the
dog
had
fallen
within
six
feet
of
its
fat
front
wheels
now
a
collie
is
like
no
other
animal
on
earth
he
is
at
worst
more
wolf
than
dog
and
at
best
he
has
more
of
the
wolf
instinct
than
has
any
other
breed
of
canine
for
which
reason
lad
was
not
then
and
there
smashed
flat
and
dead
under
the
of
a
truck
even
as
the
tires
grazed
his
fur
lad
gathered
himself
compactly
together
his
feet
well
under
him
and
sprang
far
to
one
side
the
lumbering
truck
missed
him
by
less
than
six
inches
but
it
missed
him
his
leap
brought
him
scramblingly
down
on
all
fours
out
of
the
truck
way
but
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
thoroughfare
it
brought
him
under
the
very
fender
of
a
touring
car
that
was
going
at
a
good
pace
in
the
opposite
direction
and
again
a
leap
that
was
inspired
by
quick
instinct
alone
lifted
the
dog
free
of
this
newest
he
halted
and
stared
piteously
around
in
search
of
his
deities
but
in
that
glare
and
swelter
of
traffic
a
trained
human
eye
could
not
have
recognized
any
particular
car
moreover
the
mistress
and
master
were
a
full
away
down
the
less
crowded
side
street
and
were
making
up
for
lost
time
by
putting
on
all
the
speed
they
dared
before
turning
into
the
next
westward
they
did
not
look
back
for
there
was
a
car
directly
in
front
of
them
whose
driver
seemed
uncertain
as
to
his
wheel
control
and
the
master
was
manoeuvering
to
pass
it
in
safety
not
until
they
had
reached
the
lower
end
of
riverside
drive
nearly
a
mile
to
the
north
did
either
the
master
or
mistress
turn
around
for
a
word
with
the
dog
they
loved
meantime
lad
was
standing
irresolute
and
panting
in
the
middle
of
columbus
circle
cars
of
a
million
types
from
flivver
to
trolley
seemed
to
be
whizzing
directly
at
him
from
every
direction
at
once
a
bound
a
dodge
or
a
deft
shrinking
back
would
carry
him
out
of
one
such
peril
barely
out
of
it
when
another
or
fifty
others
beset
him
and
all
the
time
even
while
he
was
trying
to
duck
out
of
danger
his
frightened
eyes
and
his
pulsing
nostrils
sought
the
mistress
and
the
master
his
eyes
in
that
mixture
of
flare
and
dusk
told
him
nothing
except
that
a
host
of
motors
were
likely
to
kill
him
but
his
nose
told
him
what
it
had
not
been
able
to
tell
him
since
morning
namely
that
through
the
reek
of
gasoline
and
horseflesh
and
countless
human
scents
there
was
a
nearness
of
fields
and
woods
and
water
and
toward
that
blessed
mingling
of
familiar
odors
he
dodged
his
threatened
way
by
a
miracle
of
luck
and
skill
he
crossed
columbus
circle
and
came
to
a
standstill
on
a
sidewalk
beside
a
low
gray
stone
wall
behind
the
wall
his
nose
taught
him
lay
miles
of
meadow
and
wood
and
lake
central
park
but
the
smell
of
the
park
brought
him
no
scent
of
the
mistress
nor
of
the
master
and
it
was
they
infinitely
more
than
his
beloved
countryside
that
he
craved
he
ran
up
the
street
on
the
sidewalk
for
a
few
rods
hesitant
alert
watching
in
every
direction
then
perhaps
seeing
a
figure
in
the
other
direction
that
looked
familiar
he
dashed
at
top
speed
eastward
for
half
a
block
then
he
made
a
sortie
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
deceived
by
the
look
of
a
passing
car
the
car
was
traveling
at
twenty
miles
an
hour
but
in
less
than
a
block
lad
caught
up
with
it
and
this
in
spite
of
the
many
things
he
had
to
dodge
and
the
greasy
slipperiness
of
the
unfamiliar
roadway
an
upward
glance
as
he
came
alongside
the
car
told
him
his
chase
was
in
vain
and
he
made
his
precarious
way
to
the
sidewalk
once
more
there
he
stood
bewildered
heartsick
lost
yes
he
was
lost
and
he
realized
it
realized
it
as
fully
as
would
a
snatched
up
by
magic
and
set
down
amid
the
trackless
himalayas
he
was
lost
and
horror
bit
deep
into
his
soul
the
average
dog
might
have
continued
to
waste
energy
and
risk
life
by
galloping
aimlessly
back
and
forth
running
hopefully
up
to
every
stranger
he
met
then
slinking
off
in
scared
disappointment
and
searching
afresh
lad
was
too
wise
for
that
he
was
lost
his
adored
mistress
had
somehow
left
him
as
had
the
master
in
this
bedlam
place
all
alone
he
stood
there
hopeless
head
and
tail
adroop
his
great
heart
dead
within
him
presently
he
became
aware
once
more
that
he
was
still
wearing
his
abominable
muzzle
in
the
stress
of
the
past
few
minutes
lad
had
actually
forgotten
the
pain
and
vexation
of
the
thing
now
the
memory
of
it
came
back
to
add
to
his
despair
and
as
a
sick
animal
will
ever
creep
to
the
woods
and
the
waste
places
for
solitude
so
the
lad
now
turned
from
the
clangor
and
evil
odors
of
the
street
to
seek
the
stretch
of
he
had
scented
over
the
gray
wall
he
sprang
and
came
earthward
with
a
crash
among
the
leafless
shrubs
that
edged
the
south
boundary
of
central
park
here
in
the
park
there
were
people
and
lights
and
too
but
they
were
few
and
they
were
far
off
around
the
dog
was
a
grateful
darkness
and
aloneness
he
lay
down
on
the
dead
grass
and
panted
the
time
was
late
february
the
weather
of
the
past
day
or
two
had
been
mild
the
earth
and
the
black
trees
had
a
faint
odor
of
spring
though
no
nostrils
less
acute
than
a
could
have
noted
it
through
the
misery
at
his
heart
and
the
carking
pain
from
his
muzzle
lad
began
to
realize
that
he
was
tired
also
that
he
was
hollow
from
lack
of
food
the
long
day
ordeal
of
the
dog
show
had
wearied
him
and
had
worn
down
his
nerves
more
than
could
a
run
the
nasty
thrills
of
the
past
had
completed
his
fatigue
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
like
most
dogs
at
a
show
he
had
drunk
a
great
deal
of
water
and
had
refused
to
touch
a
morsel
of
food
he
was
not
hungry
even
now
for
in
a
dog
hunger
goes
only
with
peace
of
mind
but
he
was
cruelly
thirsty
he
got
up
from
his
slushy
couch
on
the
dead
turf
and
trotted
wearily
toward
the
nearest
branch
of
the
central
park
lake
at
the
brink
he
stooped
to
drink
soggy
ice
still
covered
the
lake
but
the
mild
weather
had
left
a
skim
of
water
over
it
lad
tried
to
lap
up
enough
of
this
water
to
allay
his
craving
thirst
he
could
not
the
muzzle
protruded
nearly
an
inch
beyond
his
nose
either
through
faulty
adjustment
or
from
his
own
futile
efforts
to
scrape
it
off
the
awkward
steel
hinge
had
become
jammed
and
would
not
open
lad
could
not
get
his
teeth
a
apart
after
much
effort
he
managed
to
protrude
the
end
of
his
pink
tongue
and
to
touch
the
water
with
it
but
it
was
a
painful
and
drearily
slow
process
absorbing
water
drop
by
drop
in
this
way
more
through
fatigue
than
because
his
thirst
was
slaked
he
stopped
at
last
and
turned
away
from
the
lake
the
next
was
spent
in
a
diligent
and
torturing
and
wholly
useless
attempt
to
rid
himself
of
his
muzzle
after
which
the
dog
lay
panting
and
athirst
once
more
his
tender
nose
sore
and
bruised
and
bleeding
the
muzzle
as
firmly
fixed
in
place
as
ever
another
journey
to
the
lake
and
another
to
drink
and
the
pitifully
harassed
dog
uncanny
brain
began
to
work
he
no
longer
let
himself
heed
the
muzzle
experience
of
the
most
painful
sort
had
told
him
he
could
not
dislodge
it
nor
in
that
clamorous
and
city
beyond
the
park
wall
could
he
hope
to
find
the
mistress
and
the
master
these
things
being
certain
his
mind
went
on
to
the
next
step
and
the
next
step
was
home
home
the
place
where
his
happy
beautiful
life
had
been
spent
where
his
two
gods
abode
where
there
were
no
clang
and
reek
and
peril
as
here
in
new
york
home
the
house
of
peace
lad
stood
up
he
drew
in
great
breaths
of
the
muggy
air
and
he
turned
slowly
about
two
or
three
times
head
up
nostrils
aquiver
for
a
full
minute
he
stood
thus
then
he
lowered
his
head
and
trotted
westward
no
longer
he
moved
uncertainly
but
with
as
much
sureness
as
if
he
were
traversing
the
forest
behind
the
place
the
forest
that
had
been
his
since
puppyhood
now
this
is
not
a
fairy
story
nor
any
other
type
of
fanciful
yarn
so
i
do
not
pretend
to
account
for
lad
heading
unswervingly
toward
the
northwest
in
the
exact
direction
of
the
place
thirty
miles
distant
any
more
than
i
can
account
for
the
authenticated
case
of
a
collie
who
in
made
his
way
four
hundred
miles
from
the
home
of
a
new
owner
in
southern
georgia
to
the
doorstep
of
his
former
and
better
loved
master
in
the
mountains
of
north
carolina
any
more
than
i
can
account
for
the
flight
of
a
homing
pigeon
or
for
that
of
the
northbound
duck
in
spring
god
gives
to
certain
animals
a
whole
set
of
mystic
traits
which
he
withholds
utterly
from
humans
no
can
doubt
that
and
no
or
psychologist
can
explain
it
northwestward
jogged
lad
and
in
half
a
mile
he
came
to
the
low
western
wall
of
central
park
without
turning
aside
to
seek
a
gateway
he
cleared
the
wall
and
found
himself
on
eighth
avenue
in
the
very
middle
of
a
block
keeping
on
the
sidewalk
and
paying
no
heed
to
the
few
pedestrians
he
moved
along
to
the
next
westward
street
and
turned
down
it
toward
the
hudson
river
so
calmly
and
certainly
did
he
move
that
none
would
have
taken
him
for
a
lost
dog
under
the
roaring
elevated
road
at
columbus
avenue
he
trotted
his
ears
tormented
by
the
racket
of
a
train
that
reverberated
above
him
his
sense
so
blurred
by
the
sound
that
he
all
but
forgot
to
dodge
a
southbound
trolley
car
down
the
cross
street
to
amsterdam
avenue
he
bore
a
patrolman
on
his
way
to
the
west
street
police
station
to
report
for
night
duty
was
so
taken
up
by
his
own
lofty
thoughts
that
he
quite
forgot
to
glance
at
the
big
dog
that
padded
past
him
for
this
lack
of
observation
the
patrolman
was
destined
to
lose
a
good
opportunity
for
fattening
his
monthly
pay
because
on
reaching
the
station
he
learned
that
a
distressed
man
and
woman
had
just
been
there
in
a
car
to
offer
a
reward
for
the
finding
of
a
big
collie
answering
to
the
name
of
lad
as
the
dog
reached
amsterdam
avenue
a
high
little
voice
squealed
delightedly
at
him
a
baby
a
mere
fluff
of
gold
and
white
and
pink
was
crossing
the
avenue
convoyed
by
a
fat
woman
in
black
lad
was
jogging
by
the
mother
and
child
when
the
latter
discovered
the
passing
dog
with
a
shriek
of
joyous
friendliness
the
baby
flung
herself
upon
lad
and
wrapped
both
arms
about
his
shaggy
neck
why
she
shrilled
ecstatically
why
dear
doggie
now
lad
was
in
dire
haste
to
get
home
and
lad
was
in
dire
misery
of
mind
and
body
but
his
big
heart
went
out
in
eagerly
loving
answer
to
the
impulsive
caress
he
worshipped
children
and
would
cheerfully
endure
from
them
any
amount
of
mauling
at
the
baby
embrace
and
the
baby
voice
he
stopped
short
in
his
progress
his
plumy
tail
wagged
in
glad
friendliness
his
muzzled
nose
sought
wistfully
to
kiss
the
pink
little
face
on
a
level
with
his
own
the
baby
tightened
her
hug
and
laid
her
rose
leaf
cheek
close
to
his
own
i
love
you
miss
doggie
she
whispered
in
lad
ear
then
the
fat
woman
in
black
bore
down
upon
them
fiercely
she
yanked
the
baby
away
from
the
dog
then
seeing
that
the
mud
on
lad
shoulder
had
soiled
the
child
white
coat
she
whirled
a
bundle
aloft
and
brought
it
down
with
a
resounding
thwack
over
the
dog
head
lad
winched
under
the
heavy
blow
then
hot
resentment
blazed
through
his
first
instant
of
grieved
astonishment
this
unpleasant
fat
creature
in
black
was
not
a
man
wherefore
lad
contented
himself
by
baring
his
white
teeth
and
with
growling
deep
menace
far
down
in
his
throat
the
woman
shrank
back
scared
and
she
screamed
loudly
on
the
instant
the
patrolman
was
beside
her
what
wrong
asked
the
bluecoat
the
woman
pointed
a
wobbly
and
fat
forefinger
at
lad
who
had
taken
up
his
westward
journey
again
and
was
halfway
across
the
street
mad
dog
she
sputtered
hysterically
he
he
bit
me
bit
me
anyhow
without
waiting
to
hear
the
last
qualifying
sentence
the
patrolman
gave
chase
here
was
a
chance
for
honorable
at
the
very
least
as
he
ran
he
drew
his
pistol
lad
had
reached
the
westward
pavement
of
amsterdam
avenue
and
was
in
the
side
street
beyond
he
was
not
hurrying
but
his
short
ate
up
ground
in
deceptively
quick
time
by
the
time
the
policeman
had
reached
the
west
corner
of
street
and
avenue
the
dog
was
nearly
a
ahead
the
officer
still
running
leveled
his
pistol
and
fired
now
anyone
but
a
very
patrolman
or
a
knows
that
to
fire
a
shot
when
running
is
worse
than
fatal
to
any
chance
of
accuracy
no
marksman
no
one
who
has
the
remotest
knowledge
of
marksmanship
will
do
such
a
thing
the
very
best
can
not
hope
to
hit
his
target
if
he
is
joggling
his
own
arm
and
his
whole
body
by
the
motion
of
running
the
bullet
flew
high
and
to
the
right
smashing
a
window
and
making
the
echoes
resound
deafeningly
through
the
narrow
street
what
up
excitedly
asked
a
boy
who
stood
beside
a
barrel
bonfire
with
a
group
of
chums
mad
dog
puffed
the
policeman
as
he
sped
past
at
once
the
boys
joined
gleesomely
in
the
chase
outdistancing
the
officer
just
as
the
latter
fired
a
second
shot
lad
felt
a
ridge
of
pain
cut
along
his
left
flank
like
a
he
wheeled
to
face
his
invisible
foe
and
he
found
himself
looking
at
a
boys
who
charged
whoopingly
down
on
him
behind
the
boys
clumped
a
man
in
blue
flourishing
something
bright
lad
had
no
taste
for
this
sort
of
attention
always
he
had
loathed
strangers
and
these
new
strangers
seemed
bent
on
catching
him
on
barring
his
homeward
way
he
wheeled
around
again
and
continued
his
westward
journey
at
a
faster
pace
the
broke
into
louder
yells
and
three
or
four
new
recruits
joined
the
pursuers
the
yap
of
mad
dog
dog
filled
the
air
not
one
of
these
people
not
even
the
policeman
himself
had
any
evidence
that
the
collie
was
mad
there
are
not
two
really
rabid
dogs
seen
at
large
in
new
york
or
in
any
other
city
in
the
course
of
a
year
yet
at
the
back
of
the
human
throat
ever
lurks
that
of
mad
dog
ever
ready
to
leap
forth
into
shouted
words
at
the
faintest
provocation
one
wonders
disgustedly
how
many
thousand
luckless
and
totally
harmless
pet
dogs
in
the
course
of
a
year
are
thus
hunted
down
and
shot
or
kicked
or
stoned
to
death
in
the
sacred
name
of
humanity
just
because
some
idiot
mistakes
a
hanging
tongue
or
an
uncertainty
of
direction
for
signs
of
that
malady
known
as
rabies
a
dog
is
lost
he
wanders
to
and
fro
in
bewilderment
boys
pelt
or
chase
him
his
tongue
lolls
and
his
eyes
glaze
with
fear
then
ever
rises
the
yell
of
mad
dog
and
a
friendly
lovable
pet
is
joyfully
done
to
death
lad
crossed
broadway
threading
his
way
through
the
procession
and
galloped
down
the
hill
toward
riverside
park
close
always
at
his
heels
followed
the
shouting
crowd
twice
by
sprinting
the
patrolman
gained
the
front
rank
of
the
hunt
and
twice
he
fired
both
bullets
going
wide
across
west
end
avenue
and
across
riverside
drive
went
lad
and
fleeing
at
top
speed
the
ran
directly
down
to
a
pier
that
jutted
a
hundred
feet
out
into
the
hudson
river
along
this
pier
flew
lad
not
in
panic
terror
but
none
the
less
resolved
that
these
howling
new
yorkers
should
not
catch
him
and
prevent
his
going
home
onto
the
pier
the
clattering
followed
a
dock
watchman
as
lad
flashed
by
hurled
a
heavy
joist
of
wood
at
the
dog
it
whizzed
past
the
flying
hind
legs
scoring
the
barest
of
misses
and
now
lad
was
at
the
pier
end
behind
him
the
crowd
raced
sure
it
had
the
dangerous
brute
cornered
at
last
on
the
the
collie
paused
for
the
briefest
of
moments
glancing
to
north
and
to
south
everywhere
the
wide
river
stretched
away
unbridged
it
must
be
crossed
if
he
would
continue
his
homeward
course
and
there
was
but
one
way
for
him
to
cross
it
the
watchman
hard
at
his
heels
swung
upward
the
club
he
carried
down
came
the
club
with
murderous
force
upon
the
stringpiece
where
lad
had
been
standing
lad
was
no
longer
there
one
great
bound
had
carried
him
over
the
edge
and
into
the
black
water
below
down
he
plunged
into
the
river
and
far
far
under
it
fighting
his
way
gaspingly
to
the
surface
the
water
that
gushed
into
his
mouth
and
nostrils
was
salty
and
foul
not
at
all
like
the
water
of
the
lake
at
the
edge
of
the
place
it
sickened
him
and
the
february
chill
of
the
river
cut
into
him
like
a
million
to
the
surface
he
came
and
struck
out
valorously
for
the
opposite
shore
much
more
than
a
mile
away
as
his
beautiful
head
appeared
a
yell
went
up
from
the
clustering
at
the
pier
end
bits
of
wood
and
coal
began
to
shower
the
water
all
around
him
a
pistol
shot
plopped
into
the
river
a
bare
six
inches
away
from
him
but
the
light
was
bad
and
the
stream
was
a
tossing
mass
of
blackness
and
of
and
presently
the
dog
swam
unscathed
beyond
the
range
of
missiles
now
a
swim
of
a
mile
or
of
two
miles
was
no
special
exploit
for
lad
even
in
water
but
this
water
was
not
like
any
he
had
swum
in
the
tide
was
at
the
turn
for
one
thing
and
while
in
a
way
this
helped
him
yet
the
myriad
eddies
and
engendered
by
it
turned
and
jostled
and
buffeted
him
in
a
most
perplexing
way
and
there
were
spars
and
barrels
and
other
obstacles
that
were
forever
looming
up
just
in
front
of
him
or
else
banging
against
his
heaving
sides
once
a
revenue
cutter
passed
not
thirty
feet
ahead
of
him
its
wake
caught
the
dog
and
sucked
him
under
and
spun
his
body
around
and
around
before
he
could
fight
clear
of
it
his
lungs
were
bursting
he
was
worn
out
he
felt
as
sore
as
if
he
had
been
kicked
for
an
hour
the
along
his
flank
was
hurting
him
as
the
salt
water
bit
into
it
and
the
muzzle
him
but
because
of
his
hero
heart
rather
than
through
his
splendid
strength
and
wisdom
he
kept
on
for
an
hour
or
more
he
swam
until
at
last
his
body
and
brain
were
numb
and
only
the
mechanical
action
of
his
wrenched
muscles
held
him
in
motion
twice
tugs
narrowly
escaped
running
him
down
and
in
the
wake
of
each
he
waged
a
fearful
fight
for
life
after
a
century
of
effort
his
groping
forepaws
felt
the
impact
of
a
submerged
rock
then
of
another
and
with
his
last
vestige
of
strength
lad
crawled
feebly
ashore
on
a
narrow
sandspit
at
the
base
of
the
palisades
there
he
collapsed
and
lay
shivering
panting
struggling
for
breath
long
he
lay
there
letting
nature
bring
back
some
of
his
wind
and
his
his
shaggy
body
one
huge
pulsing
ache
when
he
was
able
to
move
he
took
up
his
journey
sometimes
swimming
sometimes
on
ground
he
skirted
the
to
northward
until
he
found
one
of
the
several
that
sunday
picnickers
love
to
climb
up
this
he
made
his
tottering
way
slowly
conserving
his
strength
as
best
he
could
on
the
summit
he
lay
down
again
to
rest
behind
him
across
the
stretch
of
black
and
water
rose
the
inky
skyline
of
the
city
with
a
lurid
between
its
crevices
that
smote
the
sky
ahead
was
a
plateau
with
a
downward
slope
beyond
it
once
more
getting
to
his
feet
lad
stood
and
sniffed
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
muzzled
nose
aloft
then
his
bearings
taken
he
set
off
again
but
this
time
his
was
slower
and
his
light
step
was
growing
heavier
the
terrible
strain
of
his
swim
was
passing
from
his
mighty
sinews
but
it
was
passing
slowly
because
he
was
so
tired
and
empty
and
in
such
pain
of
body
and
mind
he
saved
his
energies
until
he
should
have
more
of
them
to
save
across
the
plateau
down
the
slope
and
then
across
the
interminable
salt
meadows
to
westward
he
traveled
sometimes
on
road
or
path
sometimes
across
field
or
hill
but
always
in
an
unswerving
straight
line
it
was
a
little
before
midnight
that
he
breasted
the
first
rise
of
jersey
hills
above
hackensack
through
a
lightless
village
he
went
head
low
stride
lumbering
the
muzzle
weighing
a
ton
and
composed
of
molten
iron
and
hornet
stings
it
was
the
muzzle
now
his
first
fatigue
had
slackened
that
galled
him
worst
its
torture
was
beginning
to
do
queer
things
to
his
nerves
and
brain
even
a
stolid
nerveless
dog
hates
a
muzzle
more
than
one
sensitive
dog
has
been
driven
crazy
by
it
thirst
intolerable
thirst
was
torturing
lad
he
could
not
drink
at
the
pools
and
brooks
he
crossed
so
was
the
steel
now
that
he
could
not
even
open
his
mouth
to
pant
which
is
the
cruelest
deprivation
a
dog
can
suffer
out
of
the
shadows
of
a
ramshackle
hovel
front
yard
dived
a
monstrous
shape
that
hurled
itself
ferociously
on
the
passing
collie
a
mongrel
watchdog
part
mastiff
part
hound
part
anything
you
choose
had
been
dozing
on
his
doorstep
when
the
of
lad
feet
had
sounded
on
the
road
other
dogs
more
than
one
of
them
during
the
journey
had
run
out
to
yap
or
growl
at
the
wanderer
but
as
lad
had
been
big
and
had
followed
an
unhesitant
course
they
had
not
gone
to
the
length
of
actual
attack
this
mongrel
however
was
less
prudent
or
perhaps
he
realized
that
the
muzzle
rendered
lad
powerless
and
therefore
saw
every
prospect
of
a
safe
and
easy
victory
at
all
events
he
gave
no
warning
bark
or
growl
as
he
shot
forward
to
the
attack
lad
his
eyes
dim
with
fatigue
and
road
dust
his
ears
dulled
by
water
and
by
noise
did
not
hear
nor
see
the
foe
his
first
notice
of
the
attack
was
a
flying
weight
of
pounds
that
crashed
against
his
flank
a
double
set
of
fangs
in
the
same
instant
sank
into
his
shoulder
under
the
onslaught
lad
fell
sprawlingly
into
the
road
on
his
left
side
his
enemy
upon
him
as
lad
went
down
the
mongrel
deftly
shifted
his
unprofitable
shoulder
grip
to
a
far
more
promisingly
murderous
hold
on
his
fallen
throat
a
cat
has
five
sets
of
deadly
weapons
its
four
feet
and
its
jaws
so
has
every
animal
on
earth
human
and
otherwise
except
a
dog
a
dog
is
terrible
by
reason
of
its
teeth
encase
the
mouth
in
a
muzzle
and
a
dog
is
as
helpless
for
offensive
warfare
as
is
a
newborn
baby
and
lad
was
thus
pitiably
impotent
to
return
his
foe
attack
exhausted
flung
prone
to
earth
his
mighty
jaws
muzzled
he
seemed
as
good
as
dead
but
a
collie
down
is
not
a
collie
beaten
the
provides
against
that
even
as
he
fell
lad
instinctively
gathered
his
legs
under
him
as
he
had
done
when
he
tumbled
from
the
car
and
almost
at
once
he
was
on
his
feet
again
snarling
horribly
and
lunging
to
break
the
mongrel
his
weariness
was
forgotten
and
his
wondrous
reserve
strength
leaped
into
play
which
was
all
the
good
it
did
him
for
he
knew
as
well
as
the
mongrel
that
he
was
powerless
to
use
his
teeth
the
throat
of
a
collie
except
in
one
small
vulnerable
spot
is
armored
by
a
veritable
mattress
of
hair
into
this
hair
the
mongrel
had
driven
his
teeth
the
hair
filled
his
mouth
but
his
grinding
jaws
encountered
little
else
to
close
on
a
lurching
jerk
of
lad
strong
frame
tore
loose
the
savagely
inefficient
hold
the
mongrel
sprang
at
him
for
a
fresh
grip
lad
reared
to
meet
him
opposing
his
mighty
chest
to
the
charge
and
snapping
powerlessly
with
his
mouth
the
force
of
lad
rearing
leap
sent
the
mongrel
spinning
back
by
sheer
weight
but
at
once
he
drove
in
again
to
the
assault
this
time
he
did
not
give
his
muzzled
antagonist
a
chance
to
rear
but
sprang
at
lad
flank
lad
wheeled
to
meet
the
rush
and
opposing
his
shoulder
to
it
broke
its
force
seeing
himself
so
helpless
this
was
of
course
the
time
for
lad
to
take
to
his
heels
and
try
to
outrun
the
enemy
he
could
not
outfight
to
stand
his
ground
was
to
be
torn
eventually
to
death
being
anything
but
a
fool
lad
knew
that
yet
he
ignored
the
chance
of
safety
and
continued
to
fight
the
battle
twice
and
thrice
his
wit
and
his
uncanny
swiftness
enabled
him
to
block
the
big
mongrel
rushes
the
fourth
time
as
he
sought
to
rear
his
hind
foot
slipped
on
a
skim
of
down
went
lad
in
a
heap
and
the
mongrel
struck
before
the
collie
could
regain
his
feet
the
mongrel
teeth
had
found
a
hold
on
the
side
of
lad
throat
pinning
down
the
muzzled
dog
the
mongrel
proceeded
to
improve
his
hold
by
grinding
his
way
toward
the
jugular
now
his
teeth
encountered
something
more
solid
than
mere
hair
they
met
upon
a
thin
leather
strap
fiercely
the
mongrel
gnawed
at
this
solid
obstacle
his
brain
possibly
mistaking
it
for
flesh
lad
writhed
to
free
himself
and
to
regain
his
feet
but
pounds
of
fighting
weight
were
holding
his
neck
to
the
ground
of
a
sudden
the
mongrel
growled
in
savage
triumph
the
strap
was
bitten
through
clinging
to
the
broken
end
of
the
leather
the
victor
gave
one
final
tug
the
pull
drove
the
steel
bars
excruciatingly
deep
into
bruised
nose
for
a
moment
then
by
magic
the
was
no
longer
on
his
head
but
was
dangling
by
one
strap
between
the
muzzled
mongrel
jaws
with
a
motion
so
swift
that
the
eye
could
not
follow
it
lad
was
on
his
feet
and
plunging
deliriously
into
the
fray
through
a
miracle
his
jaws
were
free
his
torment
was
over
the
joy
of
deliverance
sent
a
glow
of
berserk
vigor
sweeping
through
him
the
mongrel
dropped
the
muzzle
and
came
eagerly
to
the
battle
to
his
dismay
he
found
himself
fighting
not
a
helpless
dog
but
a
maniac
wolf
lad
sought
no
permanent
hold
with
dizzying
quickness
his
head
and
body
moved
and
kept
moving
and
every
motion
meant
a
deep
slash
or
a
ragged
tear
in
his
enemy
hide
with
ridiculous
ease
the
collie
eluded
the
mongrel
awkward
and
ever
kept
boring
in
to
the
quivering
bone
his
short
front
teeth
sank
deep
and
bloodily
his
curved
tusks
slashed
as
the
wolf
and
the
collie
alone
can
slash
the
mongrel
swept
off
his
feet
rolled
howling
into
the
road
and
lad
tore
grimly
at
the
exposed
up
went
a
window
in
the
hovel
a
man
voice
shouted
a
woman
in
a
house
across
the
way
screamed
lad
glanced
up
to
note
this
new
diversion
the
stricken
mongrel
yelping
in
terror
and
agony
seized
the
second
respite
to
scamper
back
to
the
doorstep
howling
at
every
jump
lad
did
not
pursue
him
but
jogged
along
on
his
journey
without
one
backward
look
at
a
rivulet
a
mile
beyond
he
stopped
to
drink
and
he
drank
for
ten
minutes
then
he
went
on
unmuzzled
and
with
his
thirst
slaked
he
forgot
his
pain
his
fatigue
his
muddy
and
and
abraded
coat
and
the
memory
of
his
nightmare
day
he
was
going
home
at
gray
dawn
the
mistress
and
the
master
turned
in
at
the
gateway
of
the
place
all
night
they
had
sought
lad
from
one
end
of
manhattan
island
to
the
other
from
police
headquarters
to
dog
pound
they
had
driven
and
now
the
master
was
bringing
his
tired
and
heartsore
wife
home
to
rest
while
he
himself
should
return
to
town
and
to
the
search
the
car
chugged
dispiritedly
down
the
driveway
to
the
house
but
before
it
had
traversed
half
the
distance
the
was
shattered
by
a
thundrous
bark
of
challenge
to
the
invaders
lad
from
his
post
of
guard
on
the
veranda
ran
stiffly
forward
to
bar
the
way
then
as
he
ran
his
eyes
and
nose
suddenly
told
him
these
mysterious
newcomers
were
his
gods
the
mistress
with
a
gasp
of
rapturous
unbelief
was
jumping
down
from
the
car
before
it
came
to
a
halt
on
her
knees
she
caught
lad
muddy
and
bloody
head
tight
in
her
arms
oh
lad
she
sobbed
incoherently
laddie
whereat
by
another
miracle
lad
stiffness
and
hurts
and
weariness
were
gone
he
strove
to
lick
the
dear
face
bending
so
tearfully
above
him
then
with
an
abandon
of
puppylike
joy
he
rolled
on
the
ground
waving
all
four
soiled
little
feet
in
the
air
and
playfully
pretending
to
snap
at
the
loving
hands
that
caressed
him
which
was
ridiculous
conduct
for
a
stately
and
collie
but
lad
did
care
because
it
made
the
mistress
stop
crying
and
laugh
and
that
was
what
lad
most
wanted
her
to
do
chapter
vii
the
throwback
the
place
was
nine
miles
north
of
the
city
of
paterson
and
yearly
near
paterson
was
held
the
great
north
jersey
livestock
fair
a
fair
whose
awards
established
for
the
next
the
local
rank
of
purebred
cattle
and
sheep
and
pigs
for
thirty
miles
in
either
direction
from
the
ramapo
hill
pastures
south
of
suffern
two
days
before
the
fair
descended
a
flock
of
twenty
prize
sheep
the
playthings
of
a
man
to
whom
the
title
of
wall
street
farmer
had
a
lure
of
its
own
a
lure
that
cost
him
something
like
a
year
and
which
made
him
a
scourge
to
all
his
few
friends
among
these
luckless
friends
chanced
to
be
the
mistress
and
the
master
of
the
place
and
the
gentleman
farmer
had
decided
to
break
his
sheep
journey
by
a
stop
at
the
place
the
master
duly
apprised
of
the
sorry
honor
planned
for
his
home
set
aside
a
disused
for
the
woolly
visitors
use
into
this
their
shepherd
drove
his
dusty
and
bleating
charges
on
their
arrival
the
shepherd
was
a
somber
scot
nature
had
begun
the
work
of
somberness
in
his
highland
heart
the
duty
of
working
for
the
wall
street
farmer
had
added
tenfold
to
the
natural
tendency
his
name
was
mcgillicuddy
and
he
looked
it
now
in
northern
new
jersey
a
live
sheep
is
well
nigh
as
rare
as
a
pterodactyl
this
flock
of
twenty
had
cost
their
owner
their
weight
in
merino
wool
a
dog
especially
a
collie
that
does
not
know
sheep
is
prone
to
consider
them
his
lawful
prey
in
other
words
the
sight
of
a
sheep
has
turned
many
an
otherwise
dog
into
a
killer
to
avoid
so
black
a
smirch
on
the
place
hospitality
the
master
had
loaded
all
his
collies
except
lad
into
the
car
and
had
shipped
them
off
that
morning
for
a
sojourn
at
the
boarding
kennels
ten
miles
away
does
the
old
dog
go
too
sir
asked
the
place
foreman
with
a
questioning
nod
at
lad
after
he
had
lifted
the
others
into
the
tonneau
lad
was
viewing
the
proceedings
from
the
top
of
the
veranda
steps
the
master
looked
at
him
then
at
the
car
and
answered
no
lad
has
more
right
here
than
any
measly
imported
sheep
he
bother
them
if
i
tell
him
not
to
let
him
stay
the
sheep
convoyed
by
the
misanthropic
mcgillicuddy
filed
down
the
drive
from
the
highroad
an
hour
later
and
were
marshaled
into
the
corral
as
the
jostling
procession
followed
by
its
dour
shepherd
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
place
lad
rose
from
his
rug
on
the
veranda
his
nostrils
itching
with
the
unfamiliar
odor
his
soft
eyes
outraged
by
the
bizarre
sight
he
set
forth
to
drive
the
intruders
out
into
the
main
road
head
lowered
he
ran
uttering
no
sound
this
seemed
to
him
an
emergency
which
called
for
drastic
measures
rather
than
for
monitory
barking
for
all
he
knew
these
twenty
fat
woolly
white
things
might
be
fighters
who
would
attack
him
in
a
body
and
who
might
even
menace
the
safety
of
his
gods
and
the
glum
mcgillicuddy
did
not
impress
him
at
all
favorably
hence
the
silent
charge
at
the
foe
a
charge
launched
with
the
speed
and
terrible
menace
of
a
thunderbolt
mcgillicuddy
sprang
swiftly
to
the
front
of
his
flock
staff
upwhirled
but
before
the
staff
could
descend
on
the
furry
defender
of
the
place
a
sweet
voice
called
imperiously
to
the
dog
the
mistress
had
come
out
upon
the
veranda
and
had
seen
lad
dash
to
the
attack
lad
she
cried
the
great
dog
halted
midway
in
his
rush
down
called
the
mistress
leave
them
alone
do
you
hear
lad
them
alone
come
back
here
lad
heard
and
lad
obeyed
lad
always
obeyed
if
these
twenty
malodorous
strangers
and
their
guide
were
friends
of
the
mistress
he
must
not
drive
them
away
the
order
leave
them
alone
was
one
that
could
not
be
disregarded
trembling
with
anger
yet
with
no
thought
of
rebelling
lad
turned
and
trotted
back
to
the
veranda
he
thrust
his
cold
nose
into
the
mistress
warm
little
hand
and
looked
up
eagerly
into
her
face
seeking
a
repeal
of
the
command
to
keep
away
from
the
sheep
and
their
driver
but
the
mistress
only
patted
his
silken
head
and
whispered
we
do
like
it
any
more
than
you
do
laddie
but
we
must
let
anyone
know
we
do
leave
them
alone
past
the
veranda
filed
the
twenty
priceless
sheep
and
on
to
the
paddock
i
suppose
they
carry
off
all
the
prizes
at
the
fair
wo
they
asked
the
mistress
civilly
as
mcgillicuddy
plodded
past
her
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
aiblins
aye
grunted
mcgillicuddy
with
the
exquisite
courtesy
of
a
member
of
his
race
and
class
who
feels
he
is
being
patronized
aiblins
aye
aiblins
na
aiblins
having
thus
safeguarded
his
statement
against
assault
from
any
side
at
all
the
scot
moved
on
lad
strolled
down
toward
the
paddock
to
superintend
the
task
of
locking
up
the
sheep
the
mistress
did
not
detain
him
she
felt
calmly
certain
her
order
of
leave
them
alone
had
rendered
the
twenty
visitors
inviolate
from
him
lad
walked
slowly
around
the
paddock
his
gaze
on
the
sheep
these
were
the
first
sheep
he
had
ever
seen
yet
his
ancestors
for
a
thousand
years
or
more
had
herded
and
guarded
flocks
on
the
moors
atavism
is
mysteriously
powerful
in
dogs
and
it
takes
strange
forms
a
collie
too
has
a
queer
strain
of
wolf
in
him
not
only
in
body
but
in
brain
and
the
wolf
was
the
sheep
official
murderer
as
far
back
as
the
days
when
a
humpbacked
greek
slave
named
æsop
used
to
beguile
his
sleepless
nights
with
writing
fables
round
and
round
the
paddock
prowled
lad
his
eyes
alight
with
a
myriad
his
sensitive
nostrils
quivering
at
the
scents
that
enveloped
them
mcgillicuddy
from
time
to
time
eyed
the
dog
obliquely
and
with
a
scowl
these
sheep
were
not
the
pride
of
his
heart
his
conscientious
heart
possessed
no
pride
pride
being
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
and
the
sheep
not
being
his
own
but
the
flock
represented
his
livelihood
his
comfortably
overpaid
job
with
the
wall
street
farmer
he
was
responsible
for
their
welfare
and
mcgillicuddy
did
not
at
all
like
the
way
this
beautiful
collie
eyed
the
prize
merinos
nor
was
the
scot
satisfied
with
the
strength
of
the
corral
its
wire
fencing
was
rusty
and
sagging
from
long
disuse
its
gate
hung
crookedly
and
had
a
crazy
hasp
a
sheep
is
one
of
the
least
intelligent
creatures
on
earth
should
the
flock
leader
decide
at
any
time
during
the
night
to
press
his
heavy
bulk
against
the
gate
or
against
some
of
the
rustier
wire
strands
there
would
presently
be
a
gap
through
which
the
entire
twenty
could
amble
forth
once
outside
again
mcgillicuddy
glowered
dourly
at
lad
the
collie
returned
the
look
with
interest
a
dog
being
as
skilled
in
reading
human
faces
as
is
any
professional
dead
beat
lad
saw
the
dislike
in
mcgillicuddy
eyes
cordially
he
yearned
to
prove
his
own
distaste
for
the
shepherd
but
the
mistress
command
had
immuned
this
sour
stranger
so
lad
merely
turned
his
back
on
the
man
sat
down
flattened
his
furry
ears
close
against
his
head
thrust
his
pointed
nose
skyward
and
sniffed
mcgillicuddy
was
too
much
an
animal
man
not
to
read
the
insult
in
the
dog
posture
and
action
and
the
shepherd
fist
tightened
longingly
round
his
staff
half
an
hour
later
the
wall
street
farmer
himself
arrived
at
the
place
he
came
in
a
runabout
on
the
seat
beside
him
sat
his
son
at
his
feet
was
something
which
at
first
glance
might
have
been
either
a
quadruped
or
a
rag
bag
the
mistress
and
the
master
with
dutiful
hypocrisy
came
smilingly
out
on
the
veranda
to
welcome
the
guests
lad
who
had
returned
from
the
impromptu
stood
beside
them
at
sight
and
scent
of
this
new
batch
of
visitors
the
collie
doubtless
felt
what
novelists
used
to
describe
as
mingled
emotions
there
was
a
child
in
the
car
and
though
there
had
been
few
children
in
lad
life
yet
he
loved
them
loved
them
as
a
and
dog
always
loves
the
helpless
wherefore
at
sight
of
the
child
lad
rejoiced
but
the
animal
crouching
at
the
wall
street
farmer
feet
was
quite
a
different
form
of
guest
lad
recognized
the
thing
as
a
dog
yet
no
such
dog
as
ever
he
had
seen
an
dog
even
as
the
little
boy
was
an
child
well
sonorously
proclaimed
the
wall
street
farmer
as
he
scrambled
out
of
the
runabout
and
bore
down
upon
his
hosts
here
i
am
the
sheep
got
here
all
safe
good
i
knew
they
would
mcgillicuddy
a
genius
nothing
he
ca
do
with
sheep
you
remember
mortimer
lifting
the
lanky
youngster
from
the
seat
he
teased
so
to
come
along
his
mother
said
i
better
bring
him
i
knew
you
be
glad
shake
hands
with
them
morty
darling
i
wu
snarled
morty
darling
hanging
back
then
he
caught
sight
of
lad
the
collie
came
straight
up
to
the
child
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
and
wrinkling
his
nose
so
delightedly
that
every
white
front
tooth
showed
morty
flung
himself
forward
to
greet
the
huge
dog
but
the
wall
street
farmer
with
a
shout
of
warning
caught
the
boy
in
his
arms
and
bravely
interposed
his
own
fat
body
between
mortimer
and
lad
what
does
the
beast
mean
by
snarling
at
my
son
fiercely
demanded
the
wall
street
farmer
you
people
have
no
right
to
leave
such
a
savage
dog
at
large
he
not
snarling
the
mistress
indignantly
declared
smiling
that
lad
way
why
he
let
himself
be
cut
up
into
squares
sooner
than
hurt
a
child
still
doubtful
the
wall
street
farmer
cautiously
set
down
his
son
on
the
veranda
morty
flung
himself
bodily
upon
lad
hauling
and
mauling
the
stately
collie
this
way
and
that
had
any
grown
person
save
only
the
mistress
or
the
master
attempted
such
treatment
the
curving
white
eyeteeth
would
have
buried
themselves
very
promptly
in
the
offender
indeed
the
master
now
gazed
with
some
nervousness
at
the
performance
but
the
mistress
was
not
worried
as
to
her
adored
pet
behavior
and
the
mistress
as
ever
was
right
for
lad
endured
the
mauling
not
patiently
but
blissfully
he
fairly
writhed
with
delight
at
the
painful
tugging
of
hair
and
ears
and
moistly
he
strove
to
kiss
the
wizened
little
face
that
was
on
a
level
with
his
own
morty
repaid
this
attention
by
slapping
lad
across
the
mouth
lad
only
wagged
his
plumy
tail
the
more
ecstatically
and
snuggled
closer
to
the
preposterous
baby
meantime
the
wall
street
farmer
in
clarion
tones
was
calling
attention
to
the
second
of
the
two
treasures
he
had
brought
along
melisande
he
cried
at
the
summons
the
fuzzy
monstrosity
in
the
car
ceased
peering
snappishly
over
the
doortop
at
lad
and
condescended
to
turn
toward
its
owner
it
looked
like
something
between
an
old
english
and
a
dachshund
fur
enveloped
the
scrawny
body
a
miserable
apology
for
a
bushy
tail
hung
limply
between
crooked
hind
legs
evil
little
eyes
peered
forth
from
beneath
a
scarecrow
stubble
of
head
fringe
it
was
not
a
pretty
dog
this
canine
the
wall
street
farmer
had
just
addressed
by
the
poetic
title
of
melisande
what
in
blazes
is
he
asked
the
master
she
is
a
prussian
proudly
replied
the
wall
street
farmer
she
is
the
first
of
her
breed
ever
imported
to
america
cost
me
a
clean
to
buy
her
from
a
chicago
man
who
brought
her
over
i
going
to
exhibit
her
at
the
garden
show
next
winter
what
do
you
think
of
her
old
man
i
hate
to
tell
you
said
the
master
but
i
gladly
tell
you
what
i
think
of
that
chicago
man
he
the
original
genius
who
sold
all
the
land
between
new
york
and
jersey
city
for
a
thousand
dollars
an
acre
and
issued
the
series
of
season
admission
tickets
to
central
park
being
the
wall
street
farmer
host
the
master
said
this
in
the
recesses
of
his
own
heart
aloud
he
blithered
some
complimentary
lie
and
watched
the
visitor
lift
the
scraggy
nondescript
out
of
the
car
the
moment
she
was
on
the
ground
melisande
made
a
wild
dash
at
lad
snarling
she
snapped
ferociously
at
his
throat
lad
merely
turned
his
shaggy
shoulder
to
meet
the
onslaught
and
melisande
found
herself
gripping
nothing
but
a
mouthful
of
his
soft
hair
he
made
no
move
to
resent
the
attack
and
the
wall
street
farmer
shouting
unobeyed
mandates
to
his
pet
dragged
away
the
pugnacious
melisande
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
the
prussian
next
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
of
the
peacock
chicks
the
joy
of
the
mistress
summer
strutting
across
the
lawn
melisande
with
a
yap
of
glee
rushed
off
in
pursuit
the
chick
had
no
fear
the
dogs
of
the
place
had
always
been
trained
to
give
the
fowls
a
wide
berth
so
the
pretty
little
peacock
fell
a
pitifully
easy
prey
to
the
first
snap
of
melisande
jaws
lad
growled
deep
down
in
his
throat
at
this
gross
lawlessness
the
mistress
bit
her
lip
to
keep
her
at
the
slaughter
of
her
pet
the
master
hastily
said
something
that
was
lost
in
the
louder
volume
of
the
wall
street
farmer
bellow
as
he
sought
to
call
back
his
treasure
from
further
slaying
well
well
well
the
guest
exclaimed
as
at
last
he
returned
to
the
veranda
dragging
melisande
along
in
his
wake
i
sorry
this
happened
but
you
must
overlook
it
you
see
melisande
is
so
high
spirited
she
is
hard
to
control
that
the
way
with
thoroughbred
dogs
do
you
find
it
so
the
master
thus
appealed
to
glanced
at
his
wife
she
was
momentarily
out
of
having
gone
to
pick
up
the
killed
peacock
and
stroke
its
rumpled
plumage
so
the
master
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
plainer
speech
than
if
she
had
been
there
to
be
grieved
over
the
breach
of
hospitality
a
thoroughbred
dog
he
said
oracularly
is
either
the
best
dog
on
earth
or
else
he
is
the
worst
if
he
is
the
best
he
learns
to
mind
and
to
behave
himself
in
every
way
like
a
thoroughbred
he
learns
it
without
being
beaten
or
sworn
at
if
he
is
the
worst
then
it
wisest
for
his
owner
to
hunt
up
some
easy
mark
and
sell
the
cur
to
him
for
you
notice
i
said
his
not
his
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
those
two
terms
anybody
with
price
to
buy
a
dog
can
be
an
but
all
the
cash
coined
wo
make
a
man
a
dog
unless
he
that
sort
of
man
think
it
over
the
wall
street
farmer
glared
apoplectically
at
his
host
who
was
already
sorry
that
the
sneer
at
lad
and
the
killing
of
his
wife
pet
had
made
him
speak
so
to
a
guest
even
to
a
and
undesired
guest
then
the
wall
street
man
with
a
grunt
put
a
leash
on
melisande
and
gruffly
asked
that
she
be
fastened
to
one
of
the
vacant
kennels
the
mistress
came
back
to
the
group
as
the
beast
was
led
away
kennelward
by
the
gardener
recovering
her
the
mistress
said
to
her
guest
i
never
heard
of
a
prussian
before
is
she
trained
to
herd
your
sheep
no
replied
the
wall
street
farmer
his
rancor
forgotten
in
the
prospect
of
exploiting
his
wondrous
dog
not
yet
in
fact
she
hates
the
sheep
she
young
so
we
have
tried
to
train
her
for
shepherding
two
or
three
times
we
have
taken
her
into
the
pasture
always
on
leash
but
she
flies
at
the
sheep
and
goes
almost
crazy
with
anger
mcgillicuddy
says
it
bad
for
the
sheep
to
be
scared
by
her
so
we
keep
her
away
from
them
but
by
next
season
he
got
no
further
a
sound
of
lamentation
prolonged
and
lamentation
smote
upon
the
air
morty
ejaculated
the
visitor
in
panic
it
morty
quick
following
the
easily
traceable
direction
of
the
squalling
he
ran
up
the
veranda
steps
and
into
the
house
closely
followed
by
the
mistress
and
the
master
the
engaging
mortimer
was
of
the
stuff
whereof
explorers
are
made
no
utica
nor
veranda
contracted
his
powers
bored
by
the
stupid
talk
of
grown
folk
wearying
of
lad
friendly
advances
he
had
slipped
through
the
open
house
door
into
the
there
for
the
day
was
cool
a
jolly
wood
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
in
front
of
the
fireplace
was
an
enormous
and
cavernous
couch
in
the
precise
center
of
the
couch
was
curled
something
that
looked
like
a
ball
of
the
grayish
fluff
a
maid
sweeps
under
the
bed
as
mortimer
came
into
the
room
the
infatuated
lad
at
his
heels
the
fluffy
ball
lazily
uncurled
and
stretched
thereby
revealing
itself
as
no
ball
but
a
superfurry
gray
kitten
the
mistress
temperamental
new
persian
kitten
rejoicing
in
the
dreamily
oriental
name
of
tipperary
with
a
squeal
of
glad
discovery
mortimer
grabbed
tipperary
with
both
hands
essaying
to
pull
her
tail
now
no
sane
person
needs
to
be
told
the
basic
difference
between
the
heart
of
a
cat
and
the
heart
of
a
dog
nor
will
any
student
of
persian
kittens
be
surprised
to
hear
that
tipperary
reception
of
the
ruffianly
baby
advances
was
totally
different
from
lad
a
lightning
stroke
of
one
of
her
shapeless
and
tipperary
was
free
morty
stood
blinking
in
amaze
at
four
geometrically
regular
red
marks
on
the
back
of
his
own
pudgy
hand
tipperary
had
not
done
her
persecutor
the
honor
to
run
away
she
merely
moved
to
the
far
end
of
the
couch
and
lay
down
there
to
renew
her
nap
a
mad
fury
fired
the
brain
of
mortimer
a
fury
goaded
by
the
pain
of
his
scratches
screaming
in
rage
he
seized
the
cat
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
to
be
safe
from
teeth
and
whizzing
claws
and
stamped
across
toward
the
fire
with
her
his
arm
was
drawn
back
to
fling
the
squirming
and
offending
kitten
into
the
scarlet
heart
of
the
flames
and
then
lad
intervened
now
lad
was
not
in
the
very
least
interested
in
tipperary
treating
the
temperamental
persian
always
with
marked
coldness
it
is
even
doubtful
if
he
realized
morty
intent
but
one
thing
he
did
realize
that
a
silly
baby
was
toddling
straight
toward
the
fire
as
many
another
wise
dog
has
gone
before
and
since
lad
quietly
stepped
between
morty
and
the
hearth
he
stood
broadside
to
the
fire
and
to
the
child
a
shaggy
wall
between
the
peril
and
the
baby
but
so
quickly
had
anger
carried
mortimer
toward
the
hearth
that
the
dog
had
not
been
able
to
block
his
progress
until
only
a
bare
eighteen
inches
separated
the
youngster
from
the
blaze
thus
lad
found
the
heat
from
the
burning
logs
all
but
intolerable
it
bit
through
his
thick
coat
and
into
the
tender
flesh
beneath
like
a
rock
he
stood
there
mortimer
his
gentle
plan
of
kitten
killing
foiled
redoubled
his
screeches
lad
back
was
higher
than
the
child
eyes
yet
morty
sought
to
hurl
the
kitten
over
this
stolid
barrier
into
the
fire
tipperary
fell
short
landing
on
the
dog
shoulders
digging
her
needle
claws
viciously
therein
and
thence
leaping
to
the
floor
from
which
she
sprang
to
the
top
of
the
bookshelves
spitting
back
blasphemously
at
her
tormentor
morty
interest
in
the
fire
had
been
purely
as
a
piece
of
immolation
for
the
cat
but
finding
his
path
to
it
barred
he
straightway
resolved
to
go
thither
himself
he
started
to
move
round
to
it
in
front
of
lad
the
dog
took
a
forward
step
that
again
barred
the
way
morty
went
insane
with
wrath
at
this
new
interference
with
his
sweet
plans
his
howls
swelled
to
a
sustained
roar
that
reached
the
ears
of
the
on
the
lawn
he
flew
at
lad
beating
the
dog
with
all
the
puny
force
of
his
fists
sinking
his
milk
teeth
into
the
collie
back
wrenching
and
tearing
at
the
thick
fur
stamping
with
his
booted
heels
upon
the
absurdly
tiny
white
forepaws
kicking
the
short
ribs
and
the
tender
stomach
never
for
an
instant
did
the
child
slacken
his
howls
as
he
punished
the
dog
that
was
saving
him
from
death
rather
he
increased
their
volume
from
moment
to
moment
lad
did
not
stir
the
kicking
and
beating
and
gouging
and
were
not
pleasant
but
they
were
wholly
bearable
the
heat
was
not
the
smell
of
singed
hair
began
to
fill
the
room
but
lad
stood
firm
and
then
in
rushed
the
relief
expedition
the
wall
street
farmer
at
its
head
at
once
concluding
that
lad
had
bitten
his
son
bleeding
hand
the
irate
father
swung
aloft
a
chair
and
strode
to
the
rescue
lad
saw
him
coming
with
the
lightning
swiftness
of
his
kind
he
whirled
to
one
side
as
the
mass
of
wood
descended
the
chair
missed
him
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
splintered
into
pieces
it
was
a
chippendale
and
had
belonged
to
the
mistress
great
grandparents
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
blameless
life
lad
broke
the
sacred
guest
law
by
growling
at
a
visitor
but
surely
this
fat
bellower
was
no
guest
lad
looked
at
his
gods
for
information
down
lad
said
the
master
very
gently
his
voice
not
quite
steady
lad
perplexed
but
obedient
dropped
to
the
floor
the
brute
tried
to
kill
my
boy
stormed
the
wall
street
farmer
right
dramatically
as
he
caught
the
howling
morty
up
in
his
arms
to
study
the
extent
of
the
wound
he
my
guest
my
guest
he
my

the
master
was
saying
over
and
over
to
himself
lord

to
keep
on
remembering
my

the
mistress
came
forward
lad
would

wide

interposed
the
mistress
and

if
the

are
all

along
with
you

alone
of
all
the
place
dogs
had
the
run
of
the
house
night
and
day
of
the
sacred
during
the
rest
of
that
day
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
his
high
privilege
he
kept
out
of
the
way
perplexed
his
burns
still
paining
him
despite
the
master
ministrations
after
talking
long
and
loudly
all
evening
of
his
sheep
peerless
quality
and
of
their
certain
victory
over
all
comers
in
the
fair
the
wall
street
farmer
consented
at
last
to
go
to
bed
and
silence
settled
over
the
place
in
the
black
hour
before
dawn
that
same
silence
was
split
in
a
score
of
places
split
into
a
most
horrible
cacophony
of
sound
that
sent
sleep
scampering
to
the
winds
it
was
the
mingling
of
yells
and
bleats
and
barks
and
the
scurry
of
many
feet
it
burst
out
all
at
once
in
full
force
lasting
for
some
seconds
with
increasing
clangor
then
died
to
stillness
by
that
time
every
human
on
the
place
was
out
of
bed
in
more
or
less
rudimentary
attire
the
house
inhabitants
trooped
down
into
the
lower
hall
there
the
wall
street
farmer
was
raving
noisily
and
was
yanking
at
a
door
bolt
whose
secret
he
could
not
fathom
it
my
sheep
he
shouted
that
accursed
dog
of
yours
has
gotten
at
them
he
slaughtering
them
i
heard
the
poor
things
bleating
and
i
heard
him
snarling
among
them
they
cost
me
if
you
speaking
of
lad
blazed
the
master
he
here
are
the
flashlights
interposed
the
mistress
let
me
open
that
door
for
you
i
understand
the
bolt
out
into
the
dark
they
went
all
but
colliding
with
mcgillicuddy
the
scot
awakened
like
the
rest
had
gone
to
the
paddock
he
had
now
come
back
to
report
the
paddock
empty
and
all
the
sheep
gone
it
the
collie
tike
sputtered
mcgillicuddy
i

a
long
from

the

street
farmer
the
murderous
brute
first
he
tries
to
kill
morty
and
now
he
slaughters
my
sheep
you
the
master
started
to
speak
but
a
white
little
hand
in
the
darkness
was
laid
gently
across
his
mouth
you
told
me
he
always
slept
under
the
piano
in
your
music
room
accused
the
guest
as
the
four
made
their
way
lighting
a
path
with
the
electric
flashlights
well
i
looked
there
just
now
he
is
under
the
piano
he
he
lad
called
the
master
then
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
a
distant
growl
a
snarl
a
yelp
a
scramble
and
presently
lad
appeared
in
the
farthest
radius
of
the
flashlight
flare
for
only
a
moment
he
stood
there
then
he
wheeled
about
and
vanished
in
the
dark
nor
had
the
master
the
voice
to
call
him
back
the
momentary
glimpse
of
the
great
collie
in
the
merciless
gleam
of
the
lights
had
stricken
the
whole
party
into
an
instant
speechlessness
vividly
distinct
against
the
darkness
they
had
seen
lad
his
coat
was
rumpled
his
eyes
were
and
his
jaws
were
red
with
blood
then
he
had
vanished
a
groan
from
the
master
a
groan
of
heartbreak
was
the
first
sound
from
the
four
the
dog
he
loved
was
a
killer
it
is
true
it
is
true
stoutly
declared
the
mistress
the
wall
street
farmer
and
mcgullicuddy
had
already
broken
into
a
run
the
shepherd
had
found
the
tracks
of
many
little
hoofs
on
the
dewy
ground
and
he
was
following
the
trail
the
guest
swearing
and
panting
was
behind
him
the
mistress
and
the
master
brought
up
the
rear
at
every
step
they
peered
fearfully
around
them
for
what
they
dreaded
to
see
the
mangled
body
of
some
slain
sheep
but
they
saw
none
and
they
followed
the
trail
in
a
quarter
mile
they
came
to
its
end
all
four
flashlights
played
simultaneously
upon
a
tiny
hillock
that
rose
from
the
meadow
at
the
forest
edge
the
hillock
was
usually
green
now
it
was
white
around
its
short
slopes
was
huddled
a
flock
of
sheep
as
as
though
by
a
fence
at
the
hillock
summit
sat
lad
he
was
sitting
there
in
a
queer
attitude
one
of
his
snowy
forepaws
pinning
something
to
the
ground
something
that
could
not
be
clearly
distinguished
through
the
huddle
but
which
evidently
was
no
sheep
the
wall
street
farmer
broke
the
tense
silence
with
a
gobbled
exclamation
whisht
half
reverently
interrupted
the
shepherd
who
had
been
circling
the
hillock
on
census
duty
there
na
a
sheep
gone
nor
so
far
i
can
see
a
sheep
hurted
the
fu
twenty
is
there
the
master
flashlight
found
a
gap
through
which
its
rays
could
reach
the
hillock
crest
the
light
revealed
under
lad
gently
pinioning
forepaw
the
crouching
and
badly
scared
melisande
the
prussian
sheep
dog
mcgullicuddy
with
a
grunt
was
off
on
another
and
longer
tour
of
inspection
presently
he
came
back
he
was
breathing
hard
even
before
mcgillicuddy
made
his
report
the
master
had
guessed
at
the
main
points
of
the
mystery
solution
melisande
weary
of
captivity
had
gnawed
through
her
leash
seeking
sport
she
had
gone
to
the
paddock
there
she
had
easily
worried
loose
the
crazy
gate
latch
just
as
she
was
wriggling
through
lad
appeared
from
the
veranda
he
had
tried
to
drive
back
the
killer
from
her
prey
lad
was
a
veteran
of
several
battles
but
apart
from
her
sex
melisande
was
no
opponent
for
him
and
he
had
treated
her
accordingly
melisande
had
snapped
at
him
cutting
him
deeply
in
the
underjaw
during
the
scrimmage
the
sheep
had
bolted
out
of
the
paddock
and
had
scattered
remember
please
that
lad
ten
hours
earlier
had
never
in
his
life
seen
a
sheep
but
remember
too
that
a
million
of
his
ancestors
had
won
their
right
to
a
livelihood
by
their
almost
supernatural
skill
at
herding
flocks
let
this
explain
what
actually
happened
the
throwback
of
a
great
collie
instinct
driving
the
scared
and
subdued
melisande
before
him
and
ever
hampered
by
her
unwelcome
presence
lad
proceeded
to
round
up
the
scattered
sheep
he
was
in
the
midst
of
the
process
when
the
master
called
him
merely
galloping
back
for
an
instant
and
finding
the
summons
was
not
repeated
he
returned
to
his
atavistic
task
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
twenty
scampering
runaways
were
ringed
on
the
hillock
and
still
keeping
the
prussian
sheep
dog
out
of
mischief
lad
established
himself
in
the
ring
center
further
than
that
and
the
keeping
of
the
ring
intact
his
primal
instincts
did
not
serve
him
having
rounded
up
his
flock
lad
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
to
do
with
them
so
he
merely
held
them
there
until
the
noisily
gabbling
humans
should
decide
to
take
the
matter
out
of
his
care
mcgillicuddy
examined
every
sheep
separately
and
found
not
a
scratch
or
a
stain
on
any
of
them
then
he
told
in
effect
what
has
here
been
set
down
as
to
lad
exploit
as
he
finished
his
recital
mcgillicuddy
looked
shamefacedly
around
him
as
though
gathering
courage
for
an
irksome
task
a
sickly
yellow
dawn
was
crawling
over
the
eastern
mountains
throwing
a
ghostly
glow
on
the
shepherd
dour
and
craggy
visage
drawing
a
long
breath
of
resolve
he
advanced
upon
lad
dropping
on
one
knee
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
unconcernedly
observant
collie
mcgillicuddy
intoned

yes
the
speech
was
ridiculous
but
no
one
felt
like
laughing
not
even
the
wall
street
farmer
the
shepherd
was
gravely
sincere
and
he
knew
that
lad
would
understand
his
burring
words
and
lad
did
understand
solemnly
he
sat
up
solemnly
he
laid
one
white
forepaw
in
the
gnarled
palm
the
kneeling
shepherd
outstretched
to
him
his
eyes
glinted
in
wise
friendliness
as
they
met
the
admiring
gaze
of
the
old
man
two
born
shepherds
were
face
to
face
deep
was
calling
unto
deep
presently
mcgillicuddy
broke
the
spell
by
rising
abruptly
to
his
feet
gruffly
he
turned
to
the
master
there
na
wit

he
growled
in
speirin

nanetheless
that

mcgillicuddy
right
boomed
the

farmer
catching
but
part
of
his
shepherd
mumbled
words
good
idea
he
is
a
fine
dog
i
see
that
now
i
was
prejudiced
i
freely
admit
it
a
remarkable
dog
what
you
take
for
him
or
better
yet
how
would
you
like
to
swap
even
for
melisande
the
master
mouth
again
flew
ajar
and
many
sizzling
words
jostled
each
other
in
his
throat
before
any
of
these
could
shame
his
hospitality
by
escaping
the
mistress
hurriedly
interposed
dear
we
left
all
the
house
doors
wide
open
would
you
mind
hurrying

us
and

that
everything

chapter

the
gold
hat
the
place
was
in
the
north
jersey
hinterland
backed
by
miles
of
hill
and
forest
facing
the
lake
that
divided
it
from
the
village
and
the
railroad
and
the
other
smears
which
had
been
daubed
upon
mother
nature
smiling
face
in
the
holy
name
of
civilization
the
lonely
situation
of
the
place
made
lad
guardianship
of
its
acres
no
sinecure
at
all
the
dread
of
his
name
spread
far
carried
by
hobo
and
by
less
harmless
intruder
ten
miles
to
northward
of
the
place
among
the
mountains
of
this
same
north
jersey
hinterland
a
man
named
glure
had
bought
a
rambling
old
wilderness
farm
by
dint
of
much
money
more
zeal
and
most
dearth
of
taste
he
had
caused
the
wilderness
to
blossom
like
the
fifth
proposition
of
euclid
he
had
turned
bosky
wildwood
into
chaste
plaisaunces
lush
meadows
into
sunken
gardens
a
roomy
colonial
farmstead
into
something
between
a
feudal
castle
and
a
roadhouse
and
looking
on
his
work
he
had
seen
that
it
was
good
this
beautifier
of
the
wilderness
was
a
financial
giantlet
who
had
lately
chosen
to
amuse
himself
after
by
what
he
called
farming
hence
the
purchase
and
renovation
of
the
five
tract
the
building
of
model
farms
the
acquisition
of
priceless
livestock
and
the
hiring
of
a
battalion
of
skilled
employees
hence
too
his
dearly
loved
and
title
of
wall
street
farmer
his
name
i
repeat
was
glure
having
established
himself
in
the
region
the
wall
street
farmer
undertook
most
earnestly
to
reproduce
the
glories
of
the
life
supposedly
led
by
country
gentlemen
not
only
in
respect
to
keeping
and
in
alternately
patronizing
and
bullying
the
peasantry
but
in
filling
his
shelves
with
cups
and
other
trophies
won
by
his
livestock
to
his
open
house
few
of
the
neighboring
families
came
the
local
peasantry
jersey
mountaineers
of
revolutionary
stock
who
had
not
the
faintest
idea
they
were
peasantry
and
who
indeed
had
never
heard
of
the
word
alternately
grinned
and
swore
at
the
wall
street
treatment
of
them
and
mulcted
him
of
huge
sums
for
small
services
but
glure
keenest
disappointment
a
disappointment
that
crept
gradually
up
toward
the
monomania
point
was
the
annoyingly
continual
emptiness
of
his
when
for
instance
he
sent
to
the
paterson
livestock
show
a
score
of
his
pricelessly
imported
merino
sheep
under
his
more
pricelessly
imported
scotch
shepherd
mcgillicuddy
the
sheep
came
ambling
back
to
glure
towers
farm
bearing
no
worthier
guerdon
than
a
single
yellow
silk
rosette
and
a
commended
ribbon
first
and
second
prizes
as
well
as
the
challenge
cup
had
gone
to
flocks
owned
by
vastly
inferior
folk
small
farmers
who
had
no
money
wherewith
to
import
the
pick
of
the
scottish
moors
farmers
who
had
bred
and
developed
their
own
sheep
with
no
better
aid
than
personal
care
and
personal
judgment
at
the
hohokus
fair
too
the
country
gentleman
imported
holstein
bull
tenebris
had
had
to
content
himself
with
a
measly
red
rosette
in
token
of
second
prize
while
the
silver
cup
went
to
a
bull
owned
by
an
elderly
north
jerseyman
of
low
manners
who
had
bred
his
own
entry
and
had
bred
the
latter
ancestors
for
forty
years
back
it
was
discouraging
it
was
mystifying
there
actually
seemed
to
be
a
vulgar
conspiracy
among
the
rural
judges
a
conspiracy
to
boost
stock
and
to
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
virtues
of
overpriced
transatlantic
importations
it
was
the
same
in
the
poultry
shows
and
in
hog
exhibits
it
was
the
same
at
the
county
fair
at
one
of
these
trots
the
wall
street
farmer
in
person
drove
his
english
colt
and
a
rangy
hackensack
gelding
won
all
three
heats
in
none
of
the
three
did
glure
colt
get
within
hailing
distance
of
the
wire
before
at
least
two
other
trotters
had
clattered
under
it
glure
english
was
called
on
the
carpet
to
explain
why
a
colt
that
could
do
a
neat
in
training
was
beaten
out
in
a
trot
the
groom
lost
his
temper
and
his
place
for
he
grunted
in
reply
the
colt
was
all
there
it
was
the
driving
did
it
the
glassed
shelves
in
time
were
gay
with
ribbon
but
only
two
of
the
three
primary
colors
were
represented
there
blue
being
conspicuously
absent
as
for
cups
the
burglar
who
should
break
into
glure
towers
in
search
of
such
booty
would
find
himself
the
worse
off
by
a
wageless
night
work
then
it
was
that
the
wall
street
farmer
had
his
inspiration
which
brings
us
by
easy
degrees
to
the
hampton
dog
show
even
as
the
fiery
cross
among
the
highland
crags
once
flashed
signal
of
war
so
when
the
world
war
swirl
sucked
nation
after
nation
into
its
eddy
the
red
cross
flamed
from
one
end
of
america
to
the
other
as
the
common
rallying
point
for
those
who
for
a
time
must
do
their
fighting
on
the
hither
side
of
the
gray
seas
the
country
bristled
with
a
thousand
functions
of
a
thousand
different
kinds
with
one
objective
the
red
cross
so
it
happened
at
last
that
north
jersey
was
posted
on
state
road
and
byway
with
flaring
placards
announcing
a
mammoth
outdoor
specialty
dog
show
to
be
held
under
the
auspices
of
the
hampton
branch
of
the
american
national
red
cross
on
labor
day
hamilcar
glure
the
announcement
continued
had
kindly
donated
the
use
of
his
beautiful
grounds
for
the
event
and
had
subscribed
three
hundred
dollars
towards
its
running
expenses
and
prizes
not
only
were
the
usual
dog
classes
to
be
judged
but
an
added
interest
was
to
be
supplied
by
the
awarding
of
no
less
than
fifteen
specialty
trophies
glure
having
offered
his
grounds
and
the
initial
three
hundred
dollars
graciously
turned
over
the
details
of
the
show
to
a
committee
whose
duty
it
was
to
suggest
popular
specialties
and
to
solicit
money
for
the
cups
thus
one
morning
an
official
letter
was
received
at
the
place
asking
the
master
to
enter
all
his
available
dogs
for
the
show
at
one
dollar
apiece
for
each
class
and
to
contribute
if
he
should
so
desire
the
sum
of
fifteen
dollars
besides
for
the
purchase
of
a
specialty
cup
the
mistress
was
far
more
excited
over
the
coming
event
than
was
the
master
and
it
was
she
who
suggested
the
nature
of
the
specialty
for
which
the
cup
should
be
offered
the
next
outgoing
mail
bore
the
master
check
for
a
cup
to
be
awarded
to
the
oldest
and
dog
of
any
breed
in
the
show
it
was
like
the
mistress
to
think
of
that
and
to
reward
the
whose
pet
old
age
had
been
made
happiest
hers
was
destined
to
be
the
most
popular
specialty
of
the
entire
show
the
master
at
first
was
disposed
to
refuse
the
invitation
to
take
any
of
his
collies
to
hampton
the
dogs
were
for
the
most
part
out
of
coat
the
weather
was
warm
at
these
amateur
shows
as
at
too
many
professional
exhibits
there
was
always
danger
of
some
sick
dog
spreading
epidemic
moreover
the
at
the
place
was
already
comfortably
filled
with
cups
won
at
similar
contests
then
too
the
master
had
somehow
acquired
a
most
causeless
and
cordial
dislike
for
the
wall
street
farmer
i
believe
i
send
an
extra
ten
dollars
he
told
the
mistress
and
save
the
dogs
a
day
of
torment
what
do
you
think
by
way
of
answer
the
mistress
sat
down
on
the
floor
where
lad
was
sprawled
asleep
she
ran
her
fingers
through
his
forest
of
ruff
the
great
dog
brush
pounded
drowsily
against
the
floor
at
the
loved
touch
and
he
raised
his
head
for
further
caress
laddie
winter
coat
is
coming
in
beautifully
she
said
at
last
i
do
suppose
there
be
another
dog
there
with
such
a
coat
besides
it
to
be
outdoors
you
see
so
he
wo
catch
any
sickness
if
it
were
a
show
if
it
were
anything
longer
than
a
show
he
should
go
a
step
but
you
see
i
be
right
there
with
him
all
the
time
and
i
take
him
into
the
ring
myself
as
i
did
at
madison
square
garden
and
he
wo
be
unhappy
or
lonely
or
or
anything
and
i
always
love
to
have
people
see
how
splendid
he
is
and
those
specialty
trophies
are
pretty
sometimes
so
so
we
do
just
whatever
you
say
about
it
which
naturally
settled
the
matter
once
and
for
all
when
a
printed
copy
of
the
specialty
lists
arrived
a
week
later
the
mistress
and
the
master
scanned
eagerly
its
pages
there
were
cups
offered
for
the
best
collie
for
the
best
for
the
collie
with
the
finest
coat
for
the
best
collie
exhibited
by
a
woman
for
the
collie
whose
get
had
won
most
prizes
in
other
shows
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
section
and
in
type
six
points
larger
than
any
other
announcement
on
the
whole
schedule
were
the
words
by
the
hon
hugh
lester
maury
of
new
york
city
gold
specialty
cup
for
collies
conditions
announced
later
a
gold
cup
sighed
the
mistress
yielding
to
delusions
of
grandeur
a
cup
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
at
a
dog
show
and
and
wo
it
look
perfectly
gorgeous
in
the
very
center
of
our
trophy
shelf
there
with
the
other
cups
radiating
from
it
on
each
side
and
hold
on
laughed
the
master
trying
to
mask
his
own
thrill
by
wetblanketing
his
wife
enthusiasm
hold
on
we
have
got
it
yet
i
enter
lad
for
it
of
course
but
so
will
every
other
who
reads
that
besides
even
if
lad
should
win
it
we
have
to
buy
a
microscope
to
see
the
thing
it
will
probably
be
about
half
the
size
of
a
thimble
gold
cups
cost
gold
money
you
know
and
i
do
suppose
this
hugh
lester
maury
of
new
york
city
is
squandering
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
at
most
on
a
country
dog
show
even
for
the
red
cross
i
suppose
he
some
wall
street
chum
that
glure
has
wheedled
into
giving
a
specialty
a
novelty
to
me
i
never
heard
of
him
before
did
you
no
admitted
the
mistress
but
i
feel
i
beginning
to
love
him
oh
laddie
she
confided
to
the
dog
i
going
to
give
you
a
bath
in
naphtha
soap
every
day
till
then
and
brush
you
two
hours
every
morning
and
feed
you
on
liver
and
announced
later
quoted
the
master
studying
the
offer
once
more
i
wonder
what
that
means
of
course
in
a
specialty
show
anything
goes
but
i
do
care
what
the
conditions
are
interrupted
the
mistress
refusing
to
be
disheartened
lad
can
come
up
to
them
why
there
is
a
greater
dog
in
america
than
lad
and
you
know
it
i
know
it
assented
the
pessimistic
master
but
will
the
judge
you
might
tell
him
so
lad
will
tell
him
promised
the
mistress
do
worry
on
labor
day
morning
a
thousand
cars
from
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
were
converging
upon
the
village
of
hampton
whence
by
climbing
a
tortuous
hill
they
presently
chugged
into
the
estate
of
hamilcar
glure
wall
street
farmer
there
the
sylvan
stillness
was
shattered
by
barks
in
every
key
from
pekingese
falsetto
to
bernard
an
open
stretch
of
shaded
sward
backed
by
a
stable
that
looked
more
like
a
dissolute
cathedral
had
been
given
over

rows

of

a
banner
was
strung
between

tops
it

a
blazing
red
cross
at
either
end
in
its
center
was
the
legend
to
glure
towers
the
wall
street
farmer
as
i
have
hinted
was
a
man
of
much
taste
of
a
sort
lad
had
enjoyed
the
spin
through
the
cool
morning
air
in
the
tonneau
of
the
place
only
car
albeit
the
course
of
baths
and
combings
of
the
past
week
had
long
since
made
him
morbidly
aware
that
a
detested
dog
show
was
somewhere
at
hand
now
even
before
the
car
entered
the
fearsome
feudal
gateway
of
glure
towers
the
collie
ears
and
nose
told
him
the
hour
of
ordeal
was
at
hand
his
zest
in
the
ride
vanished
he
looked
reproachfully
at
the
mistress
and
tried
to
bury
his
head
under
her
circling
arm
lad
loathed
dog
shows
as
does
every
dog
of
nerves
and
higher
intelligence
the
mistress
after
one
experience
had
refrained
from
breaking
his
heart
by
taking
him
to
those
horrors
known
as
shows
but
as
she
herself
took
such
childish
delight
in
the
local
contests
she
had
schooled
herself
to
believe
lad
must
enjoy
them
too
lad
as
a
matter
of
fact
preferred
these
milder
ordeals
merely
as
a
man
might
prefer
one
day
of
jail
or
toothache
to
two
or
more
days
of
the
same
misery
but
even
as
he
knew
many
lesser
things
he
knew
the
adored
mistress
and
master
reveled
in
such
atrocities
as
dog
shows
and
that
he
for
some
reason
was
part
of
his
two
gods
pleasure
in
them
therefore
he
made
the
best
of
the
nuisance
which
led
his
owners
to
a
certainty
that
he
had
grown
to
like
it
parking
the
car
the
mistress
and
master
led
the
unhappy
dog
to
the
clerk
desk
received
his
number
tag
and
card
and
were
shown
where
to
bench
him
they
made
lad
as
nearly
comfortable
as
possible
on
a
raised
stall
between
a
supercilious
merle
and
a
fluffily
disconsolate
puppy
that
howled
ceaselessly
in
an
agony
of
fright
the
master
paused
for
a
moment
in
his
quest
of
water
for
lad
and
stared
at
the
merle
good
lord
he
mumbled
touching
the
mistress
arm
and
pointing
to
the
gray
dog
that
the
most
magnificent
collie
i
ever
set
eyes
on
it
farewell
to
poor
old
laddie
hopes
if
he
is
in
any
of
the
same
classes
with
that
marvel
say
goodby
right
now
to
your
hopes
of
the
gold
cup
and
to
in
the
regular
collie
division
i
wo
say
goodby
to
it
refused
the
mistress
i
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
lad
every
bit
as
beautiful
as
that
dog
every
single
bit
but
not
from
the
view
said
the
master
this
merle
a
gem
where
in
blazes
did
he
drop
from
i
wonder
these
specialty
shows
do
attract
the
stars
of
the
kennel
club
circuits
yet
this
is
as
perfect
a
dog
as
ever
grey
mist
was
it
a
pleasure
to
see
such
an
animal
or
he
corrected
himself
it
would
be
if
he
was
pitted
against
dear
old
lad
i
rather
be
kicked
than
take
lad
to
a
show
to
be
beaten
not
for
my
sake
or
even
for
yours
but
for
his
lad
will
be
sure
to
know
he
knows
everything
laddie
old
friend
i
sorry
he
stooped
down
and
patted
lad
satin
head
both
master
and
mistress
had
always
carried
their
fondness
for
lad
to
an
extent
that
perhaps
was
absurd
certainly
absurd
to
the
man
or
woman
who
has
never
owned
such
a
as
lad
as
not
one
man
or
woman
in
a
thousand
has
together
the
mistress
and
the
master
made
their
way
along
the
collie
section
trying
to
be
interested
in
the
line
of
barking
or
yelling
entries
collies
in
all
summed
up
the
master
as
they
reached
the
end
some
quality
dogs
among
them
too
but
not
one
of
the
lot
except
the
merle
that
i
be
afraid
to
have
lad
judged
against
the
merle
our
waterloo
lad
is
due
for
his
first
defeat
well
it
be
a
fair
one
that
one
comfort
it
does
comfort
in
the
very
least
returned
the
mistress
adding
look
there
is
the
trophy
table
let
go
over
perhaps
the
gold
cup
is
there
if
it
is
too
precious
to
leave
out
in
the
open
the
gold
cup
was
there
it
was
plainly
or
rather
flamingly
visible
indeed
it
smote
the
eye
from
afar
it
made
the
surrounding
array
of
pretty
silver
cups
and
engraved
medals
look
tawdrily
insignificant
its
presence
had
already
drawn
a
goodly
number
of
admirers
folk
at
whom
the
guardian
village
constable
behind
the
table
stared
with
sour
distrust
the
gold
cup
was
a
huge
bowl
of
unchased
metal
its
softly
glowing
surface
marred
only
by
the
script
words
specialty
gold
cup
awarded
to
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
the
genuineness
of
the
claim
that
the
trophy
was
of
gold
its
value
spoke
for
itself
the
vessel
was
like
a
half
melon
in
contour
and
was
supported
by
four
severely
plain
claws
its
rim
flared
outward
in
a
wide
curve
it
it
all
the
world
like
an
inverted
derby
hat
exclaimed
the
mistress
after
one
long
dumb
look
at
it
and
it
every
bit
as
big
as
a
derby
hat
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
ugly
and
so
croesusful
why
it
must
have
cost
it
must
have
cost
just
sixteen
hundred
dollars
supplemented
the
constable
beginning
to
take
pride
in
his
office
of
guardian
to
such
a
treasure
sixteen
hundred
dollars
flat
i
heard
glure
sayin
so
myself
do
go
handlin
it
please
handling
it
repeated
the
mistress
i
as
soon
think
of
handling
the
national
debt
the
superintendent
of
the
show
strolled
up
and
greeted
the
mistress
and
the
master
the
latter
scarce
heard
the
neighborly
greeting
he
was
scowling
at
the
precious
trophy
as
at
a
personal
foe
i
see
you
entered
lad
for
the
gold
cup
said
the
superintendent
sixteen
collies
in
all
are
entered
for
it
the
conditions
for
the
gold
cup
contest
were
printed
till
too
late
to
mail
them
so
i
handing
out
the
slips
this
morning
glure
took
charge
of
their
printing
they
did
get
here
from
the
job
shop
till
half
an
hour
ago
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
they
causing
a
lot
of
kicks
here
one
of
the
copies
look
it
over
and
see
what
up
against
who
the
hon
hugh
lester
maury
of
new
york
suddenly
demanded
the
master
rousing
himself
from
his
glum
inspection
of
the
cup
i
mean
the
man
who
donated
that
that
gold
hat
gold
hat
echoed
the
superintendent
with
a
chuckle
of
joy
gold
hat
now
you
say
so
i
ca
make
it
look
like
anything
else
a
derby
upside
down
with
four
who
maury
insisted
the
master
he
the
original
man
of
mystery
returned
the
superintendent
dropping
his
voice
to
exclude
the
constable
i
wanted
to
get
in
touch
with
him
about
the
delayed
set
of
conditions
i
looked
him
up
that
is
i
tried
to
he
is
advertised
in
the
premium
list
as
a
new
yorker
you
remember
that
but
his
name
is
in
the
new
york
city
directory
or
in
the
new
york
city
telephone
book
or
in
the
suburban
telephone
book
he
can
afford
to
give
a
sixteen
hundred
for
charity
but
it
seems
he
is
important
enough
to
get
his
name
in
any
directory
funny
is
it
i
asked
glure
about
him
that
all
the
good
it
did
me
you
do
mean
began
the
mistress
excitedly
i
do
mean
anything
the
superintendent
hurried
to
forestall
her
i
paid
to
take
charge
of
this
show
it
no
affair
of
mine
if
if
glure
chooses
to
invent
hugh
lester
maury
and
make
him
give
a
gold
hat
for
a
collie
prize
suggested
the
mistress
but
i
did
say
so
denied
the
superintendent
and
it
none
of
my
business
anyhow
here
but
why
should
glure
do
such
a
thing
asked
the
mistress
in
wonder
i
never
heard
of
his
shrinking
coyly
behind
another
name
when
he
wanted
to
spend
money
i
do
understand
why
he
here
is
the
for
the
maury
specialty
cup
interposed
the
superintendent
with
extreme
irrelevance
as
he
handed
her
a
pink
slip
of
paper
glance
over
it
the
mistress
took
the
slip
and
read
aloud
for
the
benefit
of
the
master
who
was
still
glowering
at
the
gold
hat
of
contest
for
hugh
lester
maury
gold
cup
no
collie
shall
be
eligible
that
has
not
already
taken
at
least
one
blue
ribbon
at
a
licensed
american
or
british
kennel
club
that
single
clause
has
barred
out
eleven
of
the
sixteen
entrants
commented
the
superintendent
you
see
most
of
the
dogs
at
these
local
shows
are
pets
and
hardly
any
of
them
have
been
to
madison
square
garden
or
to
any
of
the
other
shows
the
few
that
have
been
to
them
seldom
got
a
blue
lad
did
exclaimed
the
mistress
joyfully
he
took
two
blues
at
the
garden
last
year
and
then
you
remember
it
was
so
horrible
for
him
there
we
broke
the
rules
and
brought
him
home
without
waiting
for
i
know
said
the
superintendent
but
read
the
rest
read
the
mistress
contestant
must
have
a
certified
pedigree
containing
the
names
of
at
least
ten
lad
had
twelve
in
his
pedigree
she
added
and
certified
two
more
entrants
were
killed
out
by
clause
remarked
the
superintendent
leaving
only
three
out
of
the
original
sixteen
now
go
ahead
with
the
clause
that
puts
poor
old
lad
and
one
other
out
of
the
running
i
sorry
the
mistress
read
her
brows
crinkling
and
her
voice
trailing
as
she
proceeded
contestant
must
go
successfully
through
the
preliminary
maneuvers
prescribed
by
the
kirkaldie
association
of
great
britain
for
its
working
sheepdog
but
she
protested
lad
is
a
sheepdog
why
this
is
some
kind
of
a
joke
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
even
in
a
specialty
show
no
agreed
the
superintendent
nor
anybody
else
naturally
lad
is
a
sheepdog
there
probably
have
been
three
sheepdogs
born
within
a
hundred
miles
of
here
and
it
a
mighty
safe
bet
that
no
sheepdog
has
ever
taken
a
at
an
show
a
dog
is
almost
never
a
show
dog
i
know
of
only
one
either
here
or
in
england
and
he
a
freak
a
miracle
so
much
so
that
he
famous
all
over
the
do
you
mean
champion
lochinvar
iii
asked
the
mistress
the
dog
the
duke
of
hereford
used
to
own
that
the
dog
the
only
we
read
about
him
in
the
said
the
mistress
his
picture
was
there
too
he
was
sent
to
scotland
when
he
was
a
puppy
the
said
and
trained
to
herd
sheep
before
ever
he
was
shown
his
owner
was
trying
to
induce
other
to
make
their
dogs
useful
and
not
just
lochinvar
is
an
international
champion
too
is
he
the
superintendent
nodded
if
the
duke
of
hereford
lived
in
new
jersey
pursued
the
mistress
trying
to
talk
down
her
keen
chagrin
over
lad
mishap
lochinvar
might
have
a
chance
to
win
a
nice
gold
hat
he
has
replied
the
superintendent
he
has
every
chance
and
the
only
chance
has
queried
the
puzzled
mistress
champion
lochinvar
iii
was
the
answer
glure
bought
him
by
cable
paid
for
him
that
eclipses
untermeyer
record
price
of
for
old
squire
of
tytton
the
dog
arrived
last
week
here
a
big
blue
merle
you
ought
to
look
him
over
he
a
wonder
he
exploded
the
mistress
you
ca
mean
it
you
why
it
the
most
the
most
hideously
unsportsmanlike
thing
i
ever
heard
of
in
my
life
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
glure
put
up
this
sixteen
cup
and
then
sent
for
the
only
dog
that
could
fulfill
the
trophy
conditions
it
unbelievable
it
glure
tersely
replied
the
superintendent
which
perhaps
comes
to
the
same
thing
yes
spoke
up
the
master
harshly
entering
the
talk
for
the
first
time
and
tearing
his
disgusted
attention
from
the
gold
hat
yes
it
glure
and
it
unbelievable
and
it
worse
than
either
of
those
if
anything
can
be
do
you
see
the
full
rottenness
of
it
all
half
the
world
is
starving
or
sick
or
wounded
the
other
half
is
working
its
fingers
off
to
help
the
red
cross
make
europe
a
little
less
like
hell
and
when
every
cent
counts
in
the
work
this
this
wall
street
farmer
spends
sixteen
hundred
precious
dollars
to
buy
himself
a
gold
hat
and
he
does
it
under
the
auspices
of
the
red
cross
in
the
holy
name
of
charity
the
unsportsmanlikeness
of
it
is
nothing
to
that
it
it
an
unpardonable
sin
and
i
do
want
to
endorse
it
by
staying
here
let
get
lad
and
go
home
i
wish
to
heaven
we
could
flamed
the
mistress
as
angry
as
he
do
it
in
a
minute
if
we
were
able
to
i
feel
we
insulting
loyal
old
lad
by
making
him
a
party
to
it
all
but
we
ca
go
do
you
see
glure
is
unsportsmanlike
but
that
no
reason
we
should
be
you
told
me
again
and
again
that
no
true
sportsman
will
back
out
of
a
contest
just
because
he
finds
he
has
no
chance
of
winning
it
she
right
chimed
in
the
superintendent
you
entered
the
dog
for
the
contest
and
by
all
the
rules
he
have
to
stay
in
it
lad
does
know
the
first
thing
about
neither
does
the
only
other
local
entrant
that
the
first
two
rules
have
left
in
the
competition
and
lochinvar
is
perfect
at
every
detail
of
lad
and
the
other
ca
do
anything
but
swell
his
victory
it
rank
bad
luck
but
all
right
all
right
growled
the
master
we
go
through
with
it
does
anyone
know
the
terms
of
a
preliminaries
for
sheepdog
trials
my
own
early
education
was
neglected
glure
education
was
said
the
superintendent
he
has
the
full
set
of
rules
in
his
brand
new
sportsman
library
that
no
doubt
where
he
got
the
idea
i
went
to
him
for
them
this
morning
and
he
let
me
copy
the
laws
governing
the
preliminaries
they
absurdly
simple
for
a
dog
and
absurdly
impossible
for
a
here
i
read
them
over
to
you
he
fished
out
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
and
read
aloud
a
few
lines
of
four
posts
shall
be
set
up
at
ninety
yards
apart
at
the
corners
of
a
square
enclosure
a
fifth
post
shall
be
set
in
the
center
at
this
fifth
post
the
owner
or
handler
of
the
contestant
shall
stand
with
his
dog
nor
shall
such
owner
or
handler
move
more
than
three
feet
from
the
post
until
his
dog
shall
have
completed
the
trial
guided
only
by
voice
and
by
signs
the
dog
shall
go
alone
from
the
to
the
post
numbered
he
shall
go
thence
in
the
order
named
to
posts
and
without
returning
to
within
fifteen
feet
of
the
central
post
until
he
shall
have
reached
post
speed
and
form
shall
count
as
seventy
points
in
these
evolutions
thirty
points
shall
be
added
to
the
score
of
the
dog
or
dogs
which
shall
make
the
prescribed
tour
of
the
posts
directed
wholly
by
signs
and
without
the
guidance
of
voice
there
finished
the
superintendent
you
see
it
is
as
simple
as
a
kindergarten
game
but
a
child
who
had
never
been
taught
could
not
play
i
was
talking
to
the
english
trainer
that
glure
bought
along
with
the
dog
the
trainer
tells
me
lochinvar
can
go
through
those
maneuvers
and
a
hundred
harder
ones
without
a
word
being
spoken
he
works
entirely
by
gestures
he
watches
the
hand
where
the
hand
points
he
goes
a
snap
of
the
fingers
halts
him
then
he
looks
back
for
the
next
gesture
the
trainer
says
it
a
delight
to
watch
him
the
delight
is
all
his
grumbled
the
master
poor
poor
lad
get
bewildered
and
unhappy
he
want
to
do
whatever
we
tell
him
to
but
he
ca
understand
it
was
different
the
time
he
rounded
up
glure
flock
of
sheep
when
he
never
seen
a
sheep
before
that
was
ancestral
instinct
a
throwback
but
ancestral
instinct
wo
teach
him
to
go
to
post
and
and
and
he
hello
people
boomed
a
jarringly
cordial
voice
welcome
to
the
towers
bearing
down
upon
the
trio
was
a
large
person
round
and
yellow
of
face
and
clad
elaborately
in
a
morning
costume
that
suggested
a
with
ministerial
tendencies
he
was
dressed
for
the
occasion
glure
was
always
dressed
for
the
occasion
hello
people
repeated
the
wall
street
farmer
alternately
the
totally
unresponsive
mistress
and
master
i
see
you
been
admiring
the
maury
trophy
magnificent
eh
oh
maury
a
prince
i
tell
you
a
prince
a
bit
eccentric
perhaps
as
you
have
guessed
by
the
conditions
he
put
up
for
the
cup
but
a
prince
a
prince
we
think
everything
of
him
on
the
street
have
you
seen
my
new
dog
oh
you
must
go
and
take
a
look
at
lochinvar
i
entering
him
for
the
maury
trophy
you
know
yes
assented
the
master
dully
as
glure
paused
to
breathe
i
know
he
left
his
exultant
host
with
some
abruptness
and
piloted
the
mistress
back
to
the
collie
section
there
they
came
upon
a
scene
of
dire
wrath
disgruntled
owners
were
loudly
denouncing
the
maury
and
they
redoubled
their
plaint
at
sight
of
the
two
new
victims
of
the
trick
folk
who
had
bathed
and
brushed
and
burnished
their
pets
for
days
in
eager
anticipation
of
a
neighborhood
contest
gargled
in
positive
hatred
at
the
glorious
merle
they
read
the
pink
slips
over
and
over
with
more
rage
at
each
perusal
one
pretty
girl
had
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
bench
gathering
her
beloved
collie
head
in
her
lap
and
was
crying
unashamed
the
master
glanced
at
her
then
he
swore
softly
and
set
to
work
helping
the
mistress
in
the
task
of
fluffing
lad
glossy
coat
to
a
final
soft
shagginess
neither
of
them
spoke
there
was
nothing
to
say
but
lad
realized
more
keenly
than
could
a
human
that
both
his
gods
were
wretchedly
unhappy
and
his
great
heart
yearned
pathetically
to
comfort
them
there
one
consolation
said
a
woman
at
work
on
a
dog
in
the
opposite
bench
lochinvar
not
entered
for
anything
except
the
maury
cup
the
clerk
told
me
so
little
good
that
will
do
any
of
us
retorted
her
in
an
show
the
winner
of
the
maury
trophy
will
go
up
for
the
class
and
that
means
lochinvar
will
get
the
cup
for
the
collie
as
well
as
the
maury
cup
and
probably
the
cup
for
dog
of
any
breed
too
and
the
maury
cup
is
the
first
collie
event
on
the
programme
lamented
the
other
it
slated
to
be
called
before
even
the
puppy
and
the
novice
classes
glure
has
contestants
for
the
maury
trophy
all
out
bawled
an
attendant
at
the
end
of
the
section
the
master
unclasped
the
chain
from
lad
collar
snapped
the
light
leash
in
its
place
and
handed
the
leash
to
the
mistress
unless
you
rather
have
me
take
him
in
he
whispered
i
hate
to
think
of
your
handling
a
loser
i
rather
take
lad
to
defeat
than
any
other
dog
to
a
gold
hat
she
answered
sturdily
come
along
laddie
the
maury
contest
naturally
could
not
be
decided
in
the
regular
glure
had
thoughtfully
set
aside
a
quadrangle
of
greensward
for
the
event
a
quadrangle
bounded
by
four
white
and
numbered
posts
and
bearing
a
larger
white
post
in
its
center
a
throng
of
people
was
already
banked
deep
on
all
four
sides
of
the
enclosure
when
the
mistress
arrived
the
collie
judge
standing
by
the
central
post
declaimed
loudly
the
conditions
of
the
contest
then
he
asked
for
the
first
entrant
this
courtier
of
failure
chanced
to
be
the
only
other
local
dog
besides
lad
that
had
survived
the
first
two
clauses
of
the
conditions
he
chanced
also
to
be
the
dog
over
which
the
pretty
girl
had
been
crying
the
girl
eyes
were
still
red
through
a
haze
of
powder
as
she
led
her
slender
little
collie
into
the
ring
she
had
put
on
a
filmy
white
muslin
dress
with
gold
ribbons
that
morning
with
the
idea
of
matching
her
dog
coloring
she
looked
very
sweet
and
dainty
and
heartsore
at
the
central
post
she
glanced
up
hopelessly
at
the
judge
who
stood
beside
her
the
judge
indicated
post
no
with
a
nod
the
girl
blinked
at
the
distant
post
then
at
her
collie
after
which
she
pointed
to
the
post
run
on
over
there
mac
she
pleaded
that
a
good
boy
the
little
collie
wagged
his
tail
peered
expectantly
at
her
and
barked
but
he
did
not
stir
he
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
although
he
would
have
been
glad
to
do
it
wherefore
the
bark
presently
after
several
more
fruitless
entreaties
which
reduced
the
dog
to
a
paroxysm
of
barking
she
led
her
collie
out
of
the
enclosure
strangling
her
sobs
as
she
went
and
again
the
master
swore
softly
but
with
much
venomous
ardor
and
now
at
the
judge
command
the
mistress
led
lad
into
the
quadrangle
and
up
to
the
central
post
she
was
very
pale
but
her
thoroughbred
nerves
were
rocklike
in
their
steadiness
she
like
lad
was
of
the
breed
that
goes
down
fighting
lad
walked
majestically
beside
her
his
eyes
dark
with
sorrow
over
his
goddess
unhappiness
which
he
could
not
at
all
understand
and
which
he
so
longed
to
lighten
hitherto
at
dog
shows
lad
had
been
the
only
representative
of
the
place
to
grieve
he
thrust
his
nose
lovingly
into
the
mistress
hand
as
he
moved
along
with
her
to
the
post
and
he
whined
under
his
breath
ranging
up
beside
the
judge
the
mistress
took
off
lad
leash
and
collar
stroking
the
dog
upraised
head
she
pointed
to
the
no
post
over
there
she
bade
him
lad
looked
in
momentary
doubt
at
her
and
then
at
the
post
he
did
not
see
the
connection
nor
know
what
he
was
expected
to
do
so
again
he
looked
at
the
sorrowing
face
bent
over
him
lad
said
the
mistress
gently
pointing
once
more
to
the
post
go
now
there
was
not
one
dog
at
the
place
that
had
not
known
from
the
meaning
of
the
word
go
coupled
with
the
pointing
of
a
finger
fingers
had
pointed
hundreds
of
times
to
kennels
or
to
the
open
doorways
or
to
or
to
car
tonneaus
or
to
whatsoever
spot
the
dog
in
question
was
desired
to
betake
himself
and
the
word
go
had
always
accompanied
the
motion
lad
still
did
not
see
why
he
was
to
go
where
the
steady
finger
indicated
there
was
nothing
of
interest
over
there
no
one
to
attack
at
command
but
he
went
he
walked
for
perhaps
fifty
feet
then
he
turned
and
looked
back
go
on
called
the
voice
that
was
his
loved
law
and
he
went
on
unquestionably
as
uncomprehendingly
he
went
because
the
mistress
told
him
to
since
she
had
brought
him
out
before
this
annoying
concourse
of
humans
to
show
off
his
obedience
all
he
could
do
was
to
obey
the
knowledge
of
her
mysterious
sadness
made
him
the
more
anxious
to
please
her
so
on
he
went
presently
as
his
progress
brought
him
alongside
a
white
post
he
heard
the
mistress
call
again
he
wheeled
and
started
toward
her
at
a
run
then
he
halted
again
almost
in
for
her
hand
was
up
in
front
of
her
palm
forward
in
a
gesture
that
had
meant
stop
from
the
time
he
had
been
wont
to
run
into
the
house
with
muddy
feet
as
a
puppy
lad
stood
uncertain
and
now
the
mistress
was
pointing
another
way
and
calling
go
on
lad
go
on
confused
the
dog
started
in
the
new
direction
he
went
slowly
once
or
twice
he
stopped
and
looked
back
in
perplexity
at
her
but
as
often
came
the
order
go
on
lad
go
on
plodded
lad
vaguely
he
was
beginning
to
hate
this
new
game
played
without
known
rules
and
in
the
presence
of
a
crowd
lad
abominated
a
crowd
but
it
was
the
mistress
bidding
and
in
her
dear
voice
his
quick
hearing
could
read
what
no
human
could
read
a
longing
to
cry
it
thrilled
the
big
dog
this
subtle
note
of
grief
and
all
he
could
do
to
ease
her
sorrow
apparently
was
to
obey
this
queer
new
whim
of
hers
as
best
he
might
he
had
continued
his
unwilling
march
as
far
as
another
post
when
the
welcome
word
of
recall
came
the
recall
that
would
bring
him
close
again
to
his
sorrowing
deity
with
a
bound
he
started
back
to
her
but
for
the
second
time
came
that
gesture
and
the
cry
of
stop
go
lad
paused
reluctantly
and
stood
panting
this
thing
was
getting
on
his
nerves
and
nervousness
ever
made
him
pant
the
mistress
pointed
in
still
another
direction
and
she
was
calling
almost
beseechingly
go
on
lad
go
her
pointing
hand
waved
him
ahead
and
as
before
he
followed
its
guidance
walking
heavily
his
brain
more
and
more
befogged
lad
obeyed
this
time
he
did
not
stop
to
look
to
her
for
instructions
from
the
new
vehemence
of
the
mistress
gesture
she
had
apparently
been
ordering
him
off
the
field
in
disgrace
as
he
had
seen
puppies
ordered
from
the
house
head
and
tail
down
he
went
but
as
he
passed
by
the
third
of
those
silly
posts
she
recalled
him
gleeful
to
know
he
was
no
longer
in
disgrace
he
galloped
toward
the
mistress
only
to
be
halted
again
by
that
sharp
gesture
and
sharper
command
before
he
had
covered
a
fifth
of
the
distance
from
the
post
to
herself
the
mistress
was
actually
pointing
again
more
urgently
than
ever
and
in
still
another
direction
now
her
voice
had
in
it
a
quiver
that
even
the
humans
could
detect
a
quiver
that
made
its
sweetness
all
but
sharp
go
on
lad
go
utterly
bewildered
at
his
usually
moodless
mistress
crazy
mood
and
spurred
by
the
sharp
reprimand
in
her
voice
lad
moved
away
at
a
crestfallen
walk
four
times
he
stopped
and
looked
back
at
her
in
piteous
appeal
asking
forgiveness
of
the
unknown
fault
for
which
she
was
ordering
him
away
but
always
he
was
met
by
the
same
fierce
go
and
he
went
of
a
sudden
from
along
the
edges
of
the
quadrangle
went
up
a
prodigious
handclapping
punctuated
by
such
foolish
and
yells
as
good
old
laddie
he
it
and
through
the
looser
volume
of
sound
came
the
mistress
call
of
laddie
here
in
doubt
lad
turned
to
face
her
hesitatingly
he
went
toward
her
expecting
at
every
step
that
hateful
command
of
go
but
she
did
not
send
him
back
instead
she
was
running
forward
to
meet
him
and
out
of
her
face
the
sorrow
but
not
the
desire
to
cry
had
been
swept
away
by
a
tremulous
smile
down
on
her
knees
beside
lad
the
mistress
flung
herself
and
gathered
his
head
in
her
arms
and
told
him
what
a
splendid
dear
dog
he
was
and
how
proud
she
was
of
him
all
lad
had
done
was
to
obey
orders
as
any
dog
of
his
brain
and
heart
and
home
training
might
have
obeyed
them
yet
for
some
unexplained
reason
he
had
made
the
mistress
wildly
happy
and
that
was
enough
for
lad
forgetful
of
the
crowd
he
licked
at
her
caressing
hands
in
puppylike
ecstasy
then
he
rolled
in
front
of
her
growling
ferociously
and
catching
one
of
her
little
feet
in
his
mighty
jaws
as
though
to
crush
it
this
game
was
lad
favorite
romp
with
the
mistress
with
no
one
else
would
he
condescend
to
play
it
and
the
terrible
white
teeth
never
exerted
the
pressure
of
a
tenth
of
an
ounce
on
the
slipper
they
gripped
laddie
the
mistress
was
whispering
to
him
you
did
it
old
friend
you
did
it
terribly
badly
i
suppose
and
of
course
lose
but
we
right
we
made
the
contest
you
it
and
now
a
lot
of
noisy
and
bothersome
humans
had
invaded
the
quadrangle
and
wanted
to
paw
him
and
pat
him
and
praise
him
wherefore
lad
at
once
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
aloofly
disdainful
of
everything
and
everybody
he
detested
pawing
and
indeed
any
handling
through
the
congratulating
knot
of
folk
the
wall
street
farmer
elbowed
his
way
to
the
mistress
well
well
he
boomed
i
must
compliment
you
on
lad
a
really
intelligent
dog
i
was
surprised
i
did
think
any
dog
could
make
the
round
unless
he
been
trained
to
it
quite
a
dog
but
of
course
you
had
to
call
to
him
a
good
many
times
and
you
were
signaling
pretty
steadily
every
second
those
things
count
heavily
against
you
you
know
in
fact
they
your
chances
if
another
entrant
can
go
the
round
without
so
much
coaching
now
my
dog
lochinvar
never
needs
the
voice
at
all
and
he
needs
only
one
slight
gesture
for
each
manoeuver
still
lad
did
very
nicely
he
why
does
the
sulky
brute
pull
away
when
i
try
to
pat
him
perhaps
ventured
the
mistress
perhaps
he
did
catch
your
name
then
she
and
the
master
led
lad
back
to
his
bench
where
the
local
contingent
made
much
of
him
and
where
after
the
manner
of
a
dog
at
a
show
he
drank
much
water
and
would
eat
nothing
when
the
mistress
went
again
to
the
quadrangle
the
crowd
was
banked
thicker
than
ever
for
lochinvar
iii
was
about
to
compete
for
the
maury
trophy
the
wall
street
farmer
and
the
english
trainer
had
delayed
the
event
for
several
minutes
while
they
went
through
a
strenuous
dispute
as
the
mistress
came
up
she
heard
glure
end
the
argument
by
booming
i
tell
you
that
all
rot
why
should
he
for
me
just
as
well
as
he
for
you
i
his
master
ai
i
no
sir
replied
the
trainer
glumly
only
his
i
had
him
a
whole
week
declared
the
wall
street
farmer
and
i
put
him
through
those
rounds
a
dozen
times
he
knows
me
and
he
goes
through
it
all
like
clockwork
for
me
here
give
me
his
leash
he
snatched
the
leather
cord
from
the
protesting
trainer
and
with
a
yank
at
it
started
with
lochinvar
toward
the
central
post
the
aristocratic
merle
resented
the
tug
by
a
flash
of
teeth
then
he
thought
better
of
the
matter
swallowed
his
resentment
and
paced
along
beside
his
visibly
proud
owner
a
murmur
of
admiration
went
through
the
crowd
at
sight
of
lochinvar
as
he
moved
forward
the
dog
was
a
joy
to
look
on
such
a
dog
as
one
sees
perhaps
thrice
in
a
lifetime
such
a
dog
for
perfect
beauty
as
were
southport
sample
grey
mist
howgill
rival
sunnybank
goldsmith
or
squire
of
tytton
a
dog
for
looks
that
was
the
despair
of
all
competing
dogdom
proudly
perfect
in
carriage
in
coat
in
a
hundred
points
from
the
noble
head
to
the
long
massy
brush
lochinvar
iii
made
people
catch
their
breath
and
stare
even
the
mistress
heart
went
out
though
with
a
tinge
of
shame
for
disloyalty
to
lad
at
his
beauty
arrived
at
the
central
post
the
wall
street
farmer
unsnapped
the
leash
then
one
hand
on
the
merle
head
and
the
other
holding
a
cigar
between
two
pudgy
fingers
he
smiled
upon
the
tense
onlookers
this
was
his
moment
this
was
the
supreme
moment
which
had
cost
him
nearly
ten
thousand
dollars
in
all
he
was
due
at
last
to
win
a
trophy
that
would
be
the
talk
of
all
the
sporting
universe
these
who
had
won
lesser
prizes
from
under
his
very
nose
how
they
would
stare
after
this
at
his
treasures
ready
mr
glure
asked
the
judge
all
ready
graciously
returned
the
wall
street
farmer
taking
a
pull
at
his
thick
cigar
and
replacing
it
between
the
first
two
fingers
of
his
right
hand
he
pointed
majestically
with
the
same
hand
to
the
first
post
no
word
of
command
was
given
yet
lochinvar
moved
off
at
a
sweeping
run
directly
in
the
line
laid
out
by
his
owner
gesture
as
the
merle
came
alongside
the
post
the
wall
street
farmer
snapped
his
fingers
instantly
lochinvar
dropped
to
a
halt
and
stood
moveless
looking
back
for
the
next
gesture
this
next
gesture
was
wholly
impromptu
in
snapping
his
fingers
the
wall
street
farmer
had
not
taken
sufficient
account
of
the
cigar
stub
he
held
the
snapping
motion
had
brought
the
of
the
stub
directly
between
his
first
and
second
fingers
close
to
the
palm
the
red
coal
bit
deep
into
those
two
tenderest
spots
of
all
the
hand
with
a
reverberating
snort
the
wall
street
farmer
dropped
the
and
shook
his
anguished
hand
rapidly
up
and
down
in
the
first
sting
of
pain
the
loose
fingers
slapped
together
like
the
strands
of
an
obese
and
this
was
the
gesture
which
lochinvar
beheld
as
he
turned
to
catch
the
signal
for
his
next
move
now
the
frantic
vitus
shaking
of
the
hand
and
arm
accompanied
by
a
clumsy
and
a
mouthful
of
rich
oaths
forms
no
signal
known
to
the
very
cleverest
of
working
collies
neither
does
the
inserting
of
two
burned
fingers
into
the
signaler
mouth
which
was
the
second
motion
the
merle
noted
ignorant
as
to
the
meaning
of
either
of
these
unique
signals
the
dog
stood
puzzled
the
wall
street
farmer
recovered
at
once
from
his
fit
of
babyish
emotion
and
motioned
his
dog
to
go
on
to
the
next
post
the
merle
did
not
move
here
at
last
was
a
signal
he
understood
perfectly
well
yet
after
the
manner
of
the
working
dogs
he
had
been
most
rigidly
trained
from
earliest
days
to
finish
the
carrying
out
of
one
order
before
giving
heed
to
another
he
had
received
the
signal
to
go
in
one
direction
he
had
obeyed
he
had
then
received
the
familiar
signal
to
halt
and
to
await
instructions
again
he
had
obeyed
next
he
had
received
a
wildly
emphatic
series
of
signals
whose
meaning
he
could
not
read
a
long
course
of
training
told
him
he
must
wait
to
have
these
gestures
explained
to
him
before
undertaking
to
obey
the
simple
signal
that
had
followed
this
in
his
training
kennel
had
been
the
rule
when
a
pupil
did
not
understand
an
order
he
must
stay
where
he
was
until
he
could
be
made
to
understand
he
must
not
dash
away
to
carry
out
a
later
order
that
might
perhaps
be
intended
for
some
other
pupil
wherefore
the
merle
stood
stock
still
the
wall
street
farmer
repeated
the
gesture
of
pointing
toward
the
next
post
inquiringly
lochinvar
watched
him
the
wall
street
farmer
made
the
gesture
a
third
time
to
no
purpose
other
than
to
deepen
the
dog
look
of
inquiry
lochinvar
was
abiding
steadfastly
by
his
lessons
of
the
scottish
moorland
days
someone
in
the
crowd
tittered
someone
else
sang
out
delightedly
lad
wins
the
wall
street
farmer
heard
and
he
proceeded
to
mislay
his
self
control
again
these
inferior
country
folk
seemed
about
to
wrest
from
him
a
prize
he
had
deemed
all
his
own
and
to
rejoice
in
the
prospect
you
mongrel
cur
he
bellowed
get
along
there
this
diction
meant
nothing
to
lochinvar
except
that
his
temper
was
gone
and
with
it
his
scanty
authority
glure
saw
red
or
he
came
as
near
to
seeing
it
as
can
anyone
outside
a
novel
he
made
a
plunge
across
the
quadrangle
seized
the
beautiful
merle
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
kicked
him
now
here
was
something
the
dog
could
understand
with
entire
ease
this
vulgarian
giant
whom
he
had
disliked
from
the
first
was
daring
to
lay
violent
hands
on
him
on
champion
lochinvar
iii
the
that
had
always
been
handled
with
deference
and
whose
ugly
temper
had
never
been
trained
out
of
him
as
a
growl
of
hot
resentment
went
up
from
the
onlookers
a
far
more
murderously
resentful
growl
went
up
from
the
depths
of
furry
throat
in
a
flash
the
merle
had
wrenched
free
from
his
owner
and
in
practically
the
same
moment
his
curved
were
burying
themselves
deep
in
the
calf
of
the
wall
street
leg
then
the
trainer
and
the
judge
seized
on
the
snarlingly
floundering
pair
what
the
outraged
trainer
said
as
he
ran
up
would
have
brought
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
a
waterside
bartender

the

said
in
a
tone

no

you
have

the

by

to
the
place
that
night
setting
the
golden
monstrosity
on

the

surveyed
it
for

moment
then
said

it

chapter
ix
speaking
of
utility
the
man
huddled
frowzily
in
the
tree
crotch
like
a
rumpled
and
sick
raccoon
at
times
he
would
crane
his
thin
neck
and
peer
about
him
but
more
as
if
he
feared
rescue
than
as
though
he
hoped
for
it
then
before
slumping
back
to
his
pose
he
would
look
murderously
earthward
and
swear
with
lurid
fervor
at
the
tree
foot
the
big
dog
wasted
neither
time
nor
energy
in
frantic
barking
or
in
capering
excitedly
about
instead
he
lay
at
majestic
ease
gazing
up
toward
the
treed
man
with
grave
attentiveness
thus
for
a
full
the
two
had
remained
the
treer
and
the
treed
thus
from
present
signs
they
would
continue
to
remain
until
christmas
there
is
by
tradition
something
intensely
comic
in
the
picture
of
a
man
treed
by
a
dog
the
man
in
the
present
case
supplied
the
only
element
of
comedy
in
the
scene
the
dog
was
anything
but
comic
either
in
looks
or
in
posture
he
was
a
collie
huge
of
bulk
massive
of
shoulder
deep
and
shaggy
of
chest
his
forepaws
were
snowy
and
absurdly
small
his
eyes
were
and
sorrowful
eyes
that
proclaimed
not
only
an
uncannily
wise
brain
but
a
soul
as
well
in
brief
he
was
lad
official
guard
of
the
place
safety
it
was
in
this
rôle
of
guard
that
he
was
now
serving
as
jailer
to
the
man
he
had
seen
slouching
through
the
undergrowth
of
the
forest
which
grew
close
up
to
the
place
outbuildings
from
his
two
worshipped
deities
the
mistress
and
the
master
lad
had
learned
in
puppyhood
the
simple
provisions
of
the
guest
law
he
knew
for
example
that
no
one
openly
approaching
the
house
along
the
driveway
from
the
highroad
was
to
be
molested
such
a
visitor
advent
especially
at
night
might
lawfully
be
greeted
by
a
salvo
of
barks
but
the
barks
were
a
mere
announcement
not
a
threat
on
the
other
hand
the
law
demanded
the
instant
halting
of
all
prowlers
or
of
anyone
seeking
to
get
to
the
house
from
road
or
lake
by
circuitous
and
stealthy
means
such
roundabout
methods
spell
trespass
every
good
watchdog
knows
that
but
wholly
good
watchdogs
are
far
fewer
than
most
people
even
their
owners
realize
lad
was
one
of
the
few
trespasser
had
struck
into
the
place
grounds
from
an
adjoining
bit
of
woodland
he
had
moved
softly
and
obliquely
and
had
made
little
furtive
dashes
from
one
bit
of
cover
to
another
as
he
advanced
toward
the
outbuildings
a
hundred
yards
north
of
the
house
he
had
moved
cleverly
and
quietly
no
human
had
seen
or
heard
him
even
lad
sprawling
on
the
veranda
had
not
seen
him
for
in
spite
of
theory
a
dog
eye
by
daylight
is
not
so
keen
or
so
as
is
a
human
but
the
wind
had
brought
news
of
a
foreign
presence
on
the
place
a
presence
which
lad
hasty
glance
at
driveway
and
lake
edge
did
not
verify
so
the
dog
had
risen
to
his
feet
stretched
himself
fore
and
aft
and
trotted
quickly
away
to
investigate
scent
and
then
sound
taught
him
which
way
to
go
two
minutes
later
he
changed
his
wolf
trot
to
a
slow
and
unwontedly
walk
advancing
with
head
lowered
and
growling
softly
far
down
in
his
throat
he
was
making
straight
for
a
patch
of
sumac
ten
feet
in
front
of
him
and
a
hundred
feet
behind
the
stables
now
when
a
dog
bounds
toward
a
man
barking
and
with
head
up
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
be
feared
from
his
approach
but
when
the
pace
slackens
to
a
stiff
walk
and
his
head
sinks
low
that
is
a
very
good
time
indeed
for
the
object
of
his
attentions
to
think
seriously
of
escape
or
of
defense
instinct
or
experience
must
have
imparted
this
useful
truth
to
the
lurker
in
the
sumac
patch
for
as
the
great
dog
drew
near
the
man
incontinently
wheeled
and
broke
cover
at
the
same
instant
lad
charged
the
man
had
a
start
this
vantage
he
utilized
by
flinging
himself
bodily
at
a
hickory
tree
directly
in
his
path
up
the
rough
trunk
to
the
crotch
he
shinned
with
the
speed
of
a
chased
cat
lad
arrived
at
the
tree
bole
barely
in
time
to
collect
a
mouthful
of
cloth
from
the
climber
left
trouser
ankle
after
which
since
he
was
not
of
the
sort
to
clamor
noisily
for
what
lurked
beyond
his
reach
the
dog
yawned
and
lay
down
to
keep
guard
on
his
arboreal
prisoner
for
half
an
hour
he
lay
thus
varying
his
vigil
once
or
twice
by
sniffing
thoughtfully
at
a
ragged
scrap
of
trouser
cloth
between
his
little
white
forepaws
he
sniffed
the
thing
as
though
trying
to
commit
its
scent
to
memory
the
man
did
not
seek
help
by
shouting
instead
he
seemed
oddly
willing
that
no
other
human
should
intrude
on
his
sorry
plight
a
single
loud
yell
would
have
brought
aid
from
the
stables
or
from
the
house
or
even
from
the
lodge
up
by
the
gate
yet
though
the
man
must
have
guessed
this
he
did
not
yell
instead
he
cursed
whisperingly
at
intervals
and
snarled
at
his
captor
at
last
his
nerve
going
the
prisoner
drew
out
a
jackknife
opened
a
blade
at
each
end
of
it
and
hurled
the
ugly
missile
with
all
his
force
at
the
dog
as
the
man
had
shifted
his
position
to
get
at
the
knife
lad
had
risen
expectantly
to
his
feet
with
some
hope
that
his
captive
might
be
going
to
descend
it
was
lucky
for
lad
that
he
was
standing
when
the
knife
was
thrown
for
the
aim
was
not
bad
and
a
dog
lying
down
can
not
easily
dodge
a
dog
standing
on
all
fours
is
different
especially
if
he
is
a
collie
lad
sprang
to
one
side
instinctively
as
the
thrower
arm
went
back
the
knife
whizzed
harmless
into
the
sumac
patch
lad
teeth
bared
themselves
in
something
that
looked
like
a
smile
and
was
not
then
he
lay
down
again
on
guard
a
minute
later
he
was
up
with
a
jump
from
the
direction
of
the
house
came
a
shrill
whistle
followed
by
a
shout
of
lad
it
was
the
master
calling
him
the
summons
could
not
be
ignored
usually
it
was
obeyed
with
eager
gladness
but
now
lad
looked
worriedly
up
into
the
tree
then
coming
to
a
decision
he
galloped
away
at
top
speed
in
ten
seconds
he
was
at
the
veranda
where
the
master
stood
talking
with
a
newly
arrived
guest
before
the
master
could
speak
to
the
dog
lad
rushed
up
to
him
whimpering
in
stark
appeal
then
ran
a
few
steps
toward
the
stables
paused
looked
back
and
whimpered
again
what
the
matter
with
him
loudly
demanded
the
guest
an
obese
and
elderly
man
right
sportily
attired
what
ails
the
silly
dog
he
found
something
said
the
master
something
he
wants
me
to
come
and
see
and
he
wants
me
to
come
in
a
hurry
how
do
you
know
asked
the
guest
because
i
know
his
language
as
well
as
he
knows
mine
retorted
the
master
he
set
off
in
the
wake
of
the
excited
dog
the
guest
followed
in
more
leisurely
fashion
complaining
of
all
the
idiocy
to
let
a
measly
dog
drag
you
out
of
the
shade
on
a
day
like
this
just
to
look
at
some
dead
chipmunk
he
found
perhaps
stiffly
agreed
the
master
not
slackening
his
pace
but
if
lad
behaves
like
that
unless
it
pretty
well
worth
while
changed
a
lot
in
the
past
hour
a
man
can
do
worse
sometimes
than
follow
a
tip
his
dog
gives
him
have
it
your
own
way
grinned
the
guest
perhaps
he
may
lead
us
to
a
treasure
cave
or
to
a
damsel
in
distress
i
with
you
guy
me
if
it
amuses
you
said
the
master
it
does
his
guest
informed
him
it
amuses
me
to
see
any
grown
man
think
so
much
of
a
dog
as
you
people
think
of
lad
it
maudlin
my
house
is
the
only
one
within
a
mile
on
this
side
of
the
lake
that
has
never
been
robbed
was
the
master
reply
my
stable
is
the
only
one
in
the
same
radius
that
has
been
rifled
by
thieves
thieves
who
seem
to
do
their
work
in
broad
daylight
too
when
the
stables
wo
be
locked
i
have
lad
to
thank
for
all
that
he
the
dog
had
darted
far
ahead
now
he
was
standing
beneath
a
hickory
tree
staring
up
into
it
he
treed
a
cat
guffawed
the
guest
his
laugh
as
irritating
as
a
kick
extra
come
out
and
get
a
nice
sunstroke
folks
come
and
see
the
cat
lad
has
treed
the
master
did
not
answer
there
was
no
cat
in
the
tree
there
was
nothing
visible
in
the
tree
lad
aspect
shrank
from
hope
to
depression
he
looked
apologetically
at
the
master
then
he
began
to
sniff
once
more
at
a
scrap
of
cloth
on
the
ground
the
master
picked
up
the
cloth
and
presently
walked
over
to
the
tree
from
a
jut
of
bark
dangled
a
shred
of
the
same
cloth
the
master
hand
went
to
lad
head
in
approving
caress
it
was
not
a
cat
he
said
it
was
a
man
see
the
rags
of
oh
piffle
snorted
the
guest
next
you
be
reconstructing
the
man
middle
name
and
favorite
perfume
from
the
color
of
the
bark
on
the
tree
you
people
are
always
telling
about
wonderful
stunts
of
lad
and
that
all
the
evidence
there
generally
is
to
it
no
glure
denied
the
master
taking
a
strangle
hold
on
his
temper
no
that
not
quite
all
the
evidence
that
we
have
for
our
brag
about
lad
for
instance
we
had
the
evidence
of
your
own
eyes
when
he
herded
that
flock
of
stampeded
prize
sheep
for
you
last
spring
and
of
your
own
eyes
again
when
he
won
the
hat
cup
at
the
labor
day
dog
show
no
there
plenty
of
evidence
that
lad
is
worth
his
salt
let
it
go
at
that
shall
we
get
back
to
the
house
it
fairly
cool
on
the
veranda
by
the
way
what
was
it
you
wanted
me
to
call
lad
for
you
asked
to
see
him
and
why
here
the
idea
explained
glure
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
heat
back
to
the
shade
of
the
porch
it
what
i
drove
over
here
to
talk
with
you
about
i
making
the
rounds
of
all
this
region
and
say
i
did
ask
to
see
lad
i
asked
if
you
still
had
him
i
asked
because
oh
apologized
the
master
i
thought
you
wanted
to
see
him
most
people
ask
to
if
he
does
happen
to
be
round
when
they
call
we
i
asked
you
if
you
still
had
him
expounded
glure
because
i
hoped
you
had
i
hoped
you
were
more
of
a
patriot
patriot
echoed
the
master
puzzled
yes
that
why
i
making
this
tour
of
the
country
to
rouse
dog
owners
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
i
just
formed
a
local
branch
of
the
food
conservation
league
and
it
a
splendid
organization
warmly
approved
the
master
but
what
have
dog
owners
to
to
do
with
it
supplemented
glure
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
more
the
pity
but
they
ought
to
that
why
i
volunteered
to
make
this
canvass
it
was
my
own
idea
some
of
the
others
were
foolish
enough
to
object
but
as
i
had
founded
and
financed
this
hampton
branch
of
the
league
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
the
master
who
was
far
too
familiar
with
glure
ways
to
let
the
man
become
fairly
launched
on
a
pæan
of
you
say
it
rouse
dog
owners
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
along
what
line
we
dog
men
have
raised
a
good
many
thousand
dollars
this
past
year
by
our
red
cross
shows
and
by
our
subscriptions
to
all
sorts
of
war
funds
the
blue
cross
too
and
the
collie
ambulance
fund
have
this
is
something
better
than
the
mere
giving
of
surplus
coin
broke
in
glure
it
is
something
that
involves
sacrifice
a
needful
sacrifice
for
our
country
a
sacrifice
that
may
win
the
war
count
me
in
on
it
then
cordially
approved
the
master
count
in
all
real
dog
men
what
is
the
it
my
own
idea
modestly
boasted
glure
adding
that
is
of
course
it
been
agitated
by
other
people
in
letters
to
newspapers
and
all
that
but
i
the
first
to
go
out
and
put
it
into
actual
effect
shoot
suggested
the
weary
master
that
the
very
word
exclaimed
glure
that
the
very
thing
i
want
dog
owners
to
combine
in
doing
to
shoot
to
what
to
shoot
or
poison
or
asphyxiate
expounded
glure
warming
to
his
theme
in
short
to
get
rid
of
every
dog
the
master
jaw
swung
ajar
and
his
eyes
bulged
his
face
began
to
assume
an
unbecoming
bricky
hue
glure
went
on
you
see
neighbor
our
nation
is
up
against
it
when
war
was
declared
last
month
it
found
us
unprepared
we
got
to
pitch
in
and
economize
every
mouthful
of
food
wasted
here
is
a
new
lease
of
life
to
the
kaiser
we
cutting
down
on
sugar
and
meat
and
fat
but
for
every
cent
we
save
that
way
we
throwing
away
a
dollar
in
feeding
our
dogs
our
dogs
that
are
a
useless
senseless
costly
luxury
they
serve
no
utilitarian
end
they
eat
food
that
belongs
to
soldiers
trying
to
brighten
the
corner
where
i
am
by
persuading
my
neighbors
to
get
rid
of
their
dogs
when
i
proved
what
a
blessing
it
is
going
to
inaugurate
a
campaign
from
california
to
new
york
from
hold
on
snapped
the
master
finding
some
of
his
voice
and
in
the
same
effort
mislaying
much
of
his
temper
what
idiocy
do
you
think
you
trying
to
talk
how
many
dog
men
do
you
expect
to
convert
to
such
a
crazy
doctrine
have
you
tried
any
others
or
am
i
the
first
mark
i
sorry
you
take
it
this
way
reproved
glure
i
had
hoped
you
were
more
but
you
are
as
as
the
rest
the
hey
the
master
caught
him
up
the
then
not
the
first
i
glad
they
had
sense
enough
to
send
you
packing
they
were
blind
animal
worshipers
both
of
them
said
glure
aggrievedly
just
as
you
are
one
of
them
yelled
something
after
me
that
i
sincerely
hope
i
did
hear
aright
if
i
did
i
have
a
strong
action
for
slander
against
him
the
other
chucklehead
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
threaten
to
take
a
shotgun
to
me
if
i
did
get
off
his
land
i
sorry
sighed
the
master
for
both
of
them
seem
to
have
covered
the
ground
so
completely
that
there
is
anything
unique
for
me
to
say
or
do
now
listen
to
me
for
two
minutes
i
read
a
few
of
those
letters
in
the
newspapers
but
you
the
first
person
i
met
in
real
life
who
backs
such
rot
and
i
going
it
is
not
a
matter
for
argument
loftily
began
glure
yes
it
is
asserted
the
master
everything
is
except
religion
and
love
and
toothache
you
say
dogs
ought
to
be
destroyed
as
a
patriotic
duty
because
they
are
utilitarian
there
where
you
wrong
at
the
very
beginning
dead
wrong
i
not
talking
about
the
big
kennels
where
one
man
keeps
a
hundred
dogs
as
he
herd
so
many
prize
hogs
though
look
what
the
owners
of
such
kennels
did
for
the
country
at
the
last
new
york
show
at
madison
square
garden
every
penny
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
in
profits
from
the
show
went
to
the
red
cross
i
speaking
of
the
man
who
keeps
one
dog
or
two
or
even
three
dogs
and
keeps
them
as
pets
i
speaking
of
myself
if
you
like
do
you
know
what
it
costs
me
per
week
to
feed
my
dogs
i
not
looking
for
statistics
in
no
i
suppose
not
few
fanatics
are
well
i
figured
it
out
a
few
weeks
ago
after
i
read
one
of
those
letters
the
total
upkeep
of
all
my
dogs
averages
just
under
a
dollar
a
week
a
bare
fifty
dollars
a
year
that
true
and
and
that
fifty
dollars
interposed
glure
eagerly
would
pay
for
a
soldier
it
would
not
contradicted
the
master
trying
to
keep
some
slight
grip
on
his
sliding
temper
but
i
can
tell
you
what
it
do
part
of
it
would
go
for
burglar
insurance
which
i
do
need
now
because
no
stranger
dares
to
sneak
up
to
my
house
at
night
part
of
it
would
go
to
make
up
for
things
stolen
around
the
place
for
instance
in
the
harness
room
of
my
stable
there
are
five
sets
of
good
harness
and
two
or
three
extra
automobile
tires
unless
i
very
much
mistaken
the
best
of
those
would
be
gone
now
if
lad
had
just
treed
the
man
who
was
after
them
pshaw
exploded
glure
in
fine
scorn
we
saw
no
man
there
there
was
no
proof
of
there
was
proof
enough
for
me
continued
the
master
and
if
lad
had
scented
the
fellow
one
of
the
other
dogs
would
as
i
told
you
mine
is
the
only
house
and
mine
is
the
only
stable
on
this
side
of
the
lake
that
has
never
been
looted
mine
is
the
only
orchard
and
mine
is
the
only
garden
that
is
never
robbed
and
this
is
the
only
place
on
our
side
of
the
lake
where
dogs
are
kept
at
large
for
twelve
months
of
the
year
my
dogs
entry
fees
at
red
cross
shows
have
more
than
paid
for
their
keep
and
those
fees
went
straight
to
charity
but
the
women
of
my
family
are
as
safe
here
day
and
night
as
if
i
had
a
company
on
guard
that
assurance
counts
for
more
than
a
little
in
peace
of
mind
back
here
in
the
north
jersey
hinterland
i
not
taking
into
account
the
several
other
ways
the
dogs
bring
in
cash
income
to
us
not
even
the
cash
lad
turned
over
to
the
red
cross
when
we
sent
that
hat
cup
he
won
to
be
melted
down
and
i
not
speaking
of
our
dogs
comradeship
and
what
that
means
to
us
our
dogs
are
an
asset
in
every
way
not
a
liability
they
are
deadheads
either
for
i
pay
the
state
tax
on
them
every
year
they
true
loyal
companionable
chums
and
they
an
ornament
to
the
place
as
well
as
its
best
safeguard
all
in
return
for
table
scraps
and
skim
milk
and
less
than
a
weekly
worth
of
stale
bread
and
bones
where
do
you
figure
out
the
for
the
war
chest
if
i
got
rid
of
them
as
i
said
repeated
glure
with
cold
austerity
it
not
a
matter
for
argument
i
came
here
hoping
to
i
not
given
to
mawkish
sentiment
went
on
the
master
shamefacedly
but
on
the
day
your
fool
law
for
dog
exterminating
goes
into
effect
there
be
a
piteous
crying
of
little
children
all
over
the
whole
world
of
little
children
mourning
for
the
gentle
protecting
playmates
they
loved
and
there
be
a
million
men
and
women
whose
lives
have
all
at
once
become
lonely
and
empty
and
miserable
is
this
war
causing
enough
crying
and
loneliness
and
misery
without
your
adding
to
it
by
killing
our
dogs
for
the
matter
of
that
have
the
army
dogs
over
in
europe
been
doing
enough
for
mankind
to
warrant
a
square
deal
for
their
brothers
have
they
that
a
mass
of
sentimental
bosh
declared
glure
all
of
it
it
is
willingly
confessed
the
master
so
are
most
of
the
things
in
life
if
you
reduce
them
to
their
lowest
terms
you
know
what
a
fine
group
of
dogs
i
had
said
glure
starting
off
on
a
new
tack
i
had
a
group
that
cost
me
dog
for
dog
more
than
any
other
kennel
in
the
state
grand
dogs
too
you
remember
my
wonderful
merle
for
instance
and
and
your
rare
sheep
dog
or
was
it
a
that
a
chicago
man
sold
to
you
for
supplemented
the
master
swallowing
a
grin
i
remember
i
remember
them
all
what
then
well
resumed
glure
no
one
can
accuse
me
of
not
practicing
what
i
preach
i
began
this
splendid
campaign
by
getting
rid
of
every
dog
i
owned
so
i
yes
agreed
the
master
i
read
all
about
that
last
month
in
your
local
paper
distemper
had
run
through
your
kennel
and
you
tried
doctoring
the
dogs
on
a
theory
of
your
own
instead
of
sending
for
a
vet
so
they
all
died
tough
luck
or
perhaps
you
got
rid
of
them
that
way
on
purpose
for
the
good
of
the
cause
i
sorry
about
the
merle
he
was
i
see
there
no
use
talking
to
you
sighed
glure
in
disgust
ponderously
rising
and
waddling
toward
his
car
i
disappointed
because
i
hoped
you
were
less
and
more
patriotic
than
these
yokels
round
here
i
not
cheerily
conceded
the
master
i
not
i
glad
to
say
not
a
bit
then
pursued
glure
climbing
into
the
car
since
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
suppose
there
no
use
asking
you
to
come
to
the
little
cattle
show
i
organizing
for
week
after
next
because
that
for
the
food
conservation
league
too
and
since
you
so
out
of
sympathy
with
i
not
out
of
sympathy
with
the
league
asserted
the
master
its
card
is
in
our
kitchen
window
we
signed
its
pledge
and
boosting
it
in
every
way
we
know
how
except
by
killing
our
dogs
and
that
no
part
of
the
league
programme
as
you
know
very
well
tell
me
more
about
the
cattle
show
it
a
neighborhood
affair
said
glure
sulkily
yet
eager
to
secure
any
possible
entrants
just
a
bunch
of
cattle
cup
and
rosette
for
best
of
each
recognized
breed
and
the
usual
ribbons
for
second
and
third
three
dollars
an
entry
only
one
class
for
each
breed
every
entrant
must
have
been
raised

fifty
cents
red
cross
to
get
the
gross
proceeds
offered
the
use
of
my
south
meadow
at
glure
towers
just
as
i
did
for
the
specialty
dog
show
i
put
up
a
hundred
dollars
toward
the
running
expenses
too
micklesen
to
judge
i
do
go
in
for
stock
raising
said
the
master
my
little
alderney
heifer
is
the
only
head
of
quality
stock
i
ever
bred
i
doubt
if
she
is
worth
taking
up
there
but
i
be
glad
to
take
her
if
only
to
swell
the
competition
list
send
me
a
blank
please
lad
trotted
dejectedly
back
to
the
house
as
glure
car
chugged
away
up
the
drive
lad
was
glumly
unhappy
he
had
had
no
trouble
at
all
in
catching
the
scent
of
the
man
he
had
treed
he
had
followed
the
crashingly
made
trail
through
undergrowth
and
woodland
until
it
had
emerged
into
the
highroad
and
there
perforce
lad
had
paused
for
taught
from
puppyhood
he
knew
the
boundaries
of
the
place
as
well
as
did
the
mistress
or
the
master
and
he
knew
equally
well
that
his
own
jurisdiction
ended
at
those
boundaries
beyond
them
he
might
not
chase
even
the
most
loathed
intruder
the
highroad
was
sanctuary
wherefore
at
the
road
edge
he
stopped
and
turned
slowly
back
his
pursuit
was
ended
but
not
his
anger
nor
his
memory
of
the
scent
the
man
had
trespassed
slyly
on
the
place
he
had
gotten
away
unpunished
these
things
rankled
in
the
big
dog
mind
it
was
a
pretty
little
cattle
show
and
staged
in
a
pretty
setting
withal
at
glure
towers
two
weeks
later
the
big
sunken
meadow
on
the
verge
of
the
ramapo
river
was
lined
on
two
sides
with
impromptu
sheds
the
third
side
was
blocked
by
something
between
a
grand
stand
and
a
marquee
the
river
bordered
the
fourth
side
in
the
field
center
was
the
judging
inclosure
into
which
the
cattle
class
by
class
were
to
be
led

the
pastoral
scene

architectural

known
as
the

glure
esquire
glure
had
made
much
money
in
wall
street
a
crooked
little
street
that
begins
with
a
graveyard
and
ends
in
a
river
having
waxed
indecently
rich
he
had
erected
for
himself
a
hideously
expensive
estate
among
the
ramapo
mountains
and
had
settled
down
to
the
task
of
patronizing
his
rural
neighbors
there
he
elected
to
be
known
as
the
wall
street
farmer
a
title
that
delighted
not
only
himself
but
everyone
else
in
the
region
there
was
in
this
hinterland
stretch
a
friendly
and
constant
rivalry
among
the
natives
and
other
old
residents
in
the
matter
of
stock
raising
horses
cattle
pigs
chickens
even
a
very
few
sheep
were
bred
for
generations
along
lines
which
their
divers
owners
had
laid
out
lines
which
those
owners
fervently
believed
must
some
day
produce
perfection
each
owner
or
group
of
owners
had
his
own
special
ideas
as
to
the
best
way
to
produce
this
result
the
local
stock
shows
formed
the
only
means
of
proving
or
disproving
the
excellence
of
the
varied
theories
hence
these
shows
were
looked
upon
as
barnyard
supreme
courts
glure
had
begun
his
career
in
the
neighborhood
with
a
laudable
aim
of
excelling
everybody
else
in
everything
he
had
gone
heart
and
soul
into
stock
producing
and
as
he
had
no
breeding
theories
of
his
own
he
proceeded
to
acquire
a
set
as
it
would
necessarily
take
years
to
work
out
these
beliefs
he
bridged
the
gap
neatly
by
purchasing
and
importing
prize
livestock
and
by
entering
it
against
the
products
of
his
neighbors
strangely
enough
this
did
not
add
to
the
popularity
which
he
did
not
possess
still
more
strangely
it
did
not
add
materially
to
his
prestige
as
an
exhibitor
for
the
judges
had
an
exasperating
way
of
handing
him
a
second
or
third
prize
ribbon
and
then
of
awarding
the
coveted
blue
rosette
to
the
owner
and
breeder
of
some
local
exhibit
after
a
long
time
it
began
to
dawn
upon
glure
that
narrow
neighborhood
prejudice
deemed
it
unsportsmanlike
to
buy
prize
stock
and
exhibit
it
as
one
own
at
approximately
the
same
time
three
calves
were
born
to
newly
imported
prize
cows
in
the
model
barns
of
glure
towers
and
with
them
was
born
glure
newest
idea
no
one
could
deny
he
had
bred
these
calves
himself
they
were
born
on
his
own
place
and
of
his
own
cattle
three
breeds
were
represented
among
the
trio
of
specimens
by
points
and
by
lineage
they
were
peerless
wherefore
the
plan
for
a
show
of
neighborhood
cattle
at
length
glure
felt
he
was
coming
into
his
own
the
hinterland
folk
had
fought
shy
of
glure
since
the
dog
show
wherein
he
had
sought
to
win
the
capital
prize
by
formulating
a
set
of
conditions
that
could
be
filled
by
no
entrant
except
a
newly
imported
champion
merle
of
his
own
but
the
phrase
now
proved
a
bait
that
few
of
the
region
stock
lovers
could
resist
and
on
the
morning
of
the
show
no
fewer
than
cattle
of
standard
breeds
were
shuffling
or
lowing
in
the
big
impromptu
sheds
a
farm
hand
the
day
before
had
led
to
the
show
ground
the
sole
entrant
the
pretty
little
alderney
heifer
of
which
the
master
had
spoken
to
glure
and
which
by
the
way
was
destined
to
win
nothing
higher
than
a
ribbon
for
that
matter
to
end
the
suspense
the
best
of
the
three
glure
calves
won
only
a
second
prize
all
the
first
for
their
three
breeds
going
to
two
nonplutocratic
north
jerseymen
who
had
bred
the
ancestors
of
their
entrants
for
six
generations
the
mistress
and
the
master
motored
over
to
glure
towers
on
the
morning
of
the
show
in
their
one
car
lad
went
with
them
he
always
went
with
them
not
that
any
dog
could
hope
to
find
interest
in
a
cattle
show
but
a
dog
would
rather
go
anywhere
with
his
master
than
to
stay
at
home
without
him
witness
the
glad
alacrity
wherewith
the
weariest
dog
deserts
a
snug
fireside
in
the
vilest
weather
for
the
joy
of
a
walk
a
tire
puncture
delayed
the
trip
the
show
was
about
to
begin
when
the
car
was
at
last
parked
behind
the
sunken
meadow
the
mistress
and
the
master
with
lad
at
their
heels
started
across
the
meadow
afoot
toward
the
several
acquaintances
in
the
stand
waved
to
them
as
they
advanced
also
before
they
had
traversed
more
than
half
the
meadow
area
their
host
bore
down
upon
them
glure
dressed
as
usual
for
the
occasion
looked
like
a
blend
of
landseer
and
a
picture
of
the
man
will
he
had
been
walking
beside
a
garishly
liveried
groom
who
was
leading
an
enormous
holstein
bull
toward
the
judging
enclosure
the
bull
was
steered
by
a
bar
the
end
snapped
to
a
ring
in
his
nose
hello
good
people
glure
boomed
the
unenthusiastic
mistress
right
hand
and
bestowing
a
jarringly
annoying
slap
upon
the
master
shoulder
glad
to
see
you
you
late
almost
too
late
for
the
best
part
of
the
show
before
judging
begins
i
having
some
of
my
choicest
european
stock
paraded
in
the
ring
just
for
exhibition
you
know
not
for
a
contest
i
like
to
give
a
treat
to
some
of
these
farmers
who
think
they
know
how
to
breed
cattle
yes
queried
the
master
who
could
think
of
nothing
cleverer
to
say
take
that
bull
tenebris
of
mine
for
instance
proclaimed
glure
with
a
wave
toward
the
approaching
holstein
and
his
guide
best
ton
of
livestock
that
ever
stood
on
four
legs
look
how
he
glure
paused
in
his
lecture
for
he
saw
that
both
the
mistress
and
the
master
were
staring
not
at
the
bull
but
at
the
beast
leader
the
spectacle
of
a
groom
in
gaudy
livery
on
duty
at
a
cattle
show
was
all
but
too
much
for
their
gravity
you
looking
at
that
boy
of
mine
hey
fine
chap
is
he
a
faithful
boy
devoted
to
me
slavishly
devoted
not
like
most
of
these
grumpy
independent
jersey
rustics
not
much
he
a
treasure
winston
is
used
to
be
chief
handler
for
some
of
the
biggest
cattle
breeders
in
the
east
he
tells
me
i
got
hold
of
him
by
chance
and
just
by
the
sheerest
good
luck
a
week
or
so
ago
met
him
on
the
road
and
he
asked
for
a
lift
he
it
was
then
that
lad
disgraced
himself
and
his
deities
and
proved
himself
all
unworthy
to
appear
in
so
refined
an
assembly
the
man
in
livery
had
convoyed
the
bull
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
proudly
exhorting
glure
now
without
growl
or
other
sign
of
warning
the
hitherto
peaceable
dog
changed
into
a
murder
machine
in
a
single
mighty
bound
he
cleared
the
narrowing
distance
between
himself
and
the
advancing
groom
the
leap
sent
him
hurtling
through
the
air
an
furry
catapult
straight
for
the
man
throat
over
and
beyond
the
myriad
cattle
odors
lad
had
suddenly
recognized
a
scent
that
spelt
deathless
hatred
the
scent
had
been
verified
by
a
single
glance
at
the
brilliantly
clad
man
in
livery
wherefore
the
mad
charge
the
slashing
jaws
missed
their
mark
in
the
man
throat
by
a
bare
half
inch
that
they
missed
it
at
all
was
because
the
man
also
recognized
lad
and
shrank
back
in
mortal
terror
even
before
the
weight
smashing
against
his
chest
sent
the
groom
sprawling
backward
to
the
ground
lad
slashing
jaws
had
found
a
hold
in
place
of
the
one
they
had
missed
this
grip
was
on
the
liveried
shoulder
into
which
the
fangs
sank
to
their
depth
down
went
the
man
screaming
the
dog
atop
of
him
lad
cried
the
mistress
aghast
through
the
avenging
rage
that
misted
his
brain
the
great
dog
heard
with
a
choking
sound
that
was
almost
a
sob
he
relinquished
his
hold
and
turned
slowly
from
his
prey
the
master
and
glure
instinctively
took
a
step
toward
the
approaching
dog
and
the
writhingly
prostrate
man
then
still
more
instinctively
and
without
even
coming
to
a
standstill
before
going
into
reverse
they
both
sprang
back
they
would
have
sprung
further
had
not
the
roped
walls
of
the
show
ring
checked
them
for
tenebris
had
taken
a
sudden
and
active
part
in
the
scene
the
gigantic
holstein
during
his
career
in
europe
had
trebly
won
his
title
to
champion
and
during
the
three
years
before
his
exportation
to
america
he
had
gored
to
death
no
fewer
than
three
stable
attendants
the
bull
homicidal
temper
no
less
than
the
dazzling
price
offered
by
glure
had
caused
his
owner
to
sell
him
to
the
transatlantic
bidder
a
bull
nose
is
the
tenderest
spot
of
his
anatomy
next
to
his
eyes
he
guards
its
safety
most
zealously
thus
with
a
stout
between
him
and
his
conductor
tenebris
was
harmless
enough
but
the
conductor
just
now
had
let
go
of
that
bar
as
lad
weight
had
smitten
him
freed
tenebris
had
stood
for
an
instant
in
perplexity
fiercely
he
flung
his
gnarled
head
to
one
side
to
see
the
cause
of
the
commotion
the
gesture
swung
the
heavy
digging
the
nose
ring
cruelly
into
his
sensitive
nostrils
the
pain
maddened
tenebris
a
final
plunging
twist
of
the
head
and
the
bar
weight
tore
the
nose
ring
free
from
the
nostrils
tenebris
bellowed
thunderously
at
the
climax
of
pain
then
he
realized
he
had
shaken
off
the
only
thing
that
gave
humans
a
control
over
him
a
second
bellow
a
furious
pawing
of
the
earth
and
the
bull
lowered
his
head
his
evil
eyes
glared
about
him
in
search
of
something
to
kill
it
was
the
sight
of
this
motion
which
sent
the
master
and
glure
recoiling
against
the
ropes
in
almost
the
same
move
the
master
caught
up
his
wife
and
swung
her
over
the
top
rope
into
the
ring
he
followed
her
into
that
fragile
safety
with
a
speed
that
held
no
dignity
whatever
glure
seeing
the
action
wasted
no
time
in
wriggling
through
the
ropes
after
him
tenebris
did
not
follow
them
one
thing
and
only
one
his
red
eyes
saw
on
the
ground
not
six
feet
away
rolled
and
moaned
a
man
the
man
was
down
he
was
helpless
tenebris
charged
a
bull
plunging
at
a
object
shuts
both
eyes
a
cow
does
not
which
may
or
may
not
explain
the
spanish
theory
that
bullfights
are
safer
than
to
this
trait
many
a
matador
has
owed
his
life
tenebris
both
eyes
screwed
shut
hurled
his
bulk
at
the
prostrate
groom
head
down
nose
in
short
horns
on
a
level
with
the
earth
and
barely
clearing
it
he
made
his
rush
but
at
the
very
first
step
he
became
aware
that
something
was
amiss
with
his
pleasantly
anticipated
charge
it
did
not
follow
specifications
or
precedent
all
because
a
heavy
something
had
flung
its
weight
against
the
side
of
his
lowered
head
and
a
new
and
unbearable
pain
was
torturing
his
nostrils
tenebris
swerved
he
veered
to
one
side
throwing
up
his
head
to
clear
it
of
this
unseen
torment
as
a
result
the
horns
grazed
the
fallen
man
the
pointed
hoofs
missed
him
altogether
at
the
same
moment
the
weight
was
gone
from
against
the
bull
head
and
the
throbbing
stab
from
his
nostrils
pausing
uncertainly
tenebris
opened
his
eyes
and
glared
about
him
a
yard
or
two
away
a
shaggy
dog
was
rising
from
the
tumble
caused
by
the
jerky
uptossing
of
the
bull
head
now
were
this
a
fiction
yarn
it
would
be
interesting
to
devise
reasons
why
lad
should
have
flown
to
the
rescue
of
a
human
whom
he
loathed
and
arrayed
himself
against
a
toward
which
he
felt
no
hatred
at
all
to
dogs
all
men
are
gods
and
perhaps
lad
felt
the
urge
of
saving
even
a
detested
god
from
the
onslaught
of
a
beast
or
perhaps
not
one
can
go
only
by
the
facts
and
the
facts
were
that
the
collie
had
checked
himself
in
the
reluctant
journey
toward
the
mistress
and
had
gone
to
his
foe
defense
with
a
flash
of
speed
astonishing
in
so
large
and
sedate
a
dog
he
had
flown
at
the
bull
in
time
in
the
barest
time
to
grip
the
torn
nostrils
and
turn
the
whirlwind
charge
and
now
tenebris
shifted
his
baleful
glare
from
the
advancing
dog
to
the
howling
man
the
dog
could
wait
the
bull
immediate
pleasure
and
purpose
were
to
kill
the
man
he
lowered
his
head
again
but
before
he
could
launch
his
enormous
bulk
into
full
motion
before
he
could
shut
his
eyes
the
dog
was
between
him
and
his
quarry
in
one
spring
lad
was
at
the
bull
nose
and
again
his
white
eye
teeth
slashed
the
ragged
nostrils
tenebris
halted
his
own
incipient
rush
and
strove
to
pin
the
collie
to
the
ground
it
would
have
been
as
easy
to
pin
a
whizzing
hornet
tenebris
thrust
at
the
clinging
dog
once
more
seeking
to
smash
lad
against
the
sod
with
his
forehead
and
his
short
horns
but
lad
was
not
there
instead
he
was
to
the
left
his
body
clean
out
of
danger
his
teeth
in
the
bull
left
ear
a
lunge
of
the
tortured
head
sent
lad
rolling
over
and
over
but
by
the
time
he
stopped
rolling
he
was
on
his
feet
again
not
only
on
his
feet
but
back
to
the
assault
back
before
his
unwieldy
foe
could
gauge
the
distance
for
another
rush
at
the
man
and
a
keen
nip
in
the
bleeding
nostrils
balked
still
one
more
charge
the
bull
snorting
with
rage
suddenly
changed
his
plan
of
campaign
apparently
his
first
ideas
had
been
wrong
it
was
the
man
who
could
wait
and
the
dog
that
must
be
gotten
out
of
the
way
tenebris
wheeled
and
made
an
rush
at
lad
the
collie
turned
and
fled
he
did
not
flee
with
tail
down
as
befits
a
beaten
dog
brush
wavingly
aloft
he
gamboled
along
at
top
speed
just
a
stride
or
two
ahead
of
the
pursuing
bull
he
even
looked
back
encouragingly
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
lad
was
having
a
beautiful
time
seldom
had
he
been
so
riotously
happy
all
the
mischief
in
his
soul
was
having
a
glorious
airing
the
bull
blind
charge
was
short
as
a
bull
charge
always
is
when
tenebris
opened
his
eyes
he
saw
the
dog
not
ten
feet
in
front
of
him
scampering
for
dear
life
toward
the
river
and
again
tenebris
charged
three
such
charges
one
after
another
brought
pursuer
and
pursued
to
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
water
tenebris
was
not
used
to
running
he
was
getting
winded
he
came
to
a
wavering
standstill
snorting
loudly
and
pawing
up
great
lumps
of
sod
but
he
had
not
stood
thus
longer
than
a
second
before
lad
was
at
him
burnished
shaggy
coat
tail
delightedly
wagging
the
dog
bounded
forward
he
set
up
an
fanfare
of
barking
round
and
round
the
bull
he
whirled
never
letting
up
on
that
deafening
volley
of
barks
nipping
now
at
ears
now
at
nose
now
at
heels
dodging
in
and
out
under
the
giant
clumsy
body
easily
avoiding
the
bewilderingly
awkward
kicks
and
lunges
of
his
enemy
then
forefeet
crouching
and
muzzle
close
to
the
ground
like
a
playful
puppy
he
waved
his
plumed
tail
violently
and
in
a
new
succession
of
barks
wooed
his
adversary
to
the
attack
it
was
a
pretty
sight
and
it
set
tenebris
into
active
motion
at
once
the
bull
doubtless
thought
he
himself
was
doing
the
driving
by
means
of
his
panting
rushes
and
by
his
lurches
to
one
side
or
another
to
keep
away
from
the
dog
sharp
bites
but
he
was
not
it
was
lad
who
chose
the
direction
in
which
they
went
and
he
chose
it
deliberately
presently
the
two
were
but
fifteen
feet
away
from
the
river
at
a
point
where
the
bank
shelved
for
two
or
three
yards
down
to
a
wide
pool
feinting
for
the
nose
lad
induced
tenebris
to
lower
his
tired
head
then
he
sprang
lightly
over
the
threatening
horns
and
landed
with
all
four
feet
on
the
bull
broad
shoulders
scurrying
along
the
heaving
back
the
dog
nipped
tenebris
on
the
hip
and
dropped
to
earth
again
the
insult
the
fresh
pain
the
astonishment
combined
to
make
tenebris
forget
his
weariness
beside
himself
with
maniac
wrath
he
shut
both
eyes
and
launched
himself
forward
lad
slipped
to
one
side
carried
by
his
own
blind
momentum
tenebris
shot
over
the
bank
edge
too
late
the
bull
looked
half
sliding
half
scrambling
he
crashed
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
bank
and
into
the
river
lad
tongue
out
jogged
over
to
the
top
of
the
bank
where
with
head
to
one
side
and
ears
cocked
he
gazed
interestedly
down
into
the
wildly
churned
pool
tenebris
had
gotten
to
his
feet
after
the
ducking
and
he
was
floundering
in
stickily
soft
mud
so
tightly
bogged
down
that
it
later
took
the
efforts
of
six
to
extricate
him
the
bull
continued
to
flounder
and
to
bellow
a
stream
of
people
were
running
down
the
meadow
toward
the
river
lad
hated
crowds
he
made
a
loping
detour
of
the
nearest
runners
and
sought
to
regain
the
spot
where
last
he
had
seen
the
mistress
and
master
also
if
his
luck
held
good
he
might
have
still
another
bout
with
the
man
he
had
once
treed
which
would
be
an
ideal
climax
to
a
perfect
day
he
found
all
the
objects
of
his
quest
together
the
groom
hysterical
was
swaying
on
his
feet
supported
by
glure
at
sight
of
the
advancing
collie
the
bitten
man
cried
aloud
in
fear
and
clutched
his
employer
for
protection
take
him
away
sir
he
babbled
in
mortal
terror

he
hates
me
the
ugly
hairy
devil
he
me
he
tried
to
kill
me
once
before
he
h
mused
the
master
so
he
tried
to
kill
you
once
before
eh
are
you
mistaken
no
i
ai
wept
the
man
i
know
him
in
a
million
that
why
he
went
for
me
again
he
remembered
me
i
seen
he
did
that
no
dog
it
a
glure
asked
the
master
a
light
dawning
when
this
chap
applied
to
you
for
work
did
he
wear
grayish
tweed
trousers
and
were
they
in
bad
shape
his
trousers
were
in
rags
said
glure
i
remember
that
he
said
a
savage
dog
had
jumped
into
the
road
from
a
farmhouse
somewhere
and
gone
for
him
why
those
trousers
answered
the
master
were
entire
strangers
to
you
you
seen
the
missing
parts
of
them
on
a
tree
and
on
the
ground
near
it
at
the
place
your
is
the
harness
thief
lad
treed
the
day
you
came
to
see
me
so
nonsense
fumed
glure
why
how
absurd
he
i
had
stolen
nothing
blubbered
the
man
i
was
coming
to
a
stable
to
ask
for
work
and
the
brute
went
for
me
i
had
to
run
up
a
tree
and
and
it
did
occur
to
you
to
shout
for
help
sweetly
urged
the
master
i
was
within
call
so
was
glure
so
was
at
least
one
of
my
men
an
honest
seeker
for
work
need
have
been
afraid
to
halloo
a
thief
would
have
been
afraid
to
in
fact
a
thief
get
out
of
here
you
roared
glure
convinced
at
last
you
measly
sneak
thief
get
out
or
i
have
you
jailed
you
an
imposter
a
a
the
thief
waited
to
hear
no
more
with
an
apprehensive
glance
to
see
that
lad
was
firmly
held
he
bolted
for
the
road
thanks
for
telling
me
said
glure
he
might
have
stolen
everything
at
glure
towers
if
i
had
found
out
he
yes
he
might
even
have
stolen
more
than
the
cost
of
our
lad
keep
unkindly
suggested
the
master
for
that
matter
if
it
had
been
for
a
dog
that
mad
horns
instead
of
his
nostrils
would
be
red
by
this
time
at
least
one
man
would
have
been
killed
perhaps
more
so
after
all
he
stopped
the
mistress
was
tugging
surreptitiously
at
his
sleeve
the
master
in
obedience
to
his
wife
signal
stepped
aside
to
light
a
cigar
i
would
say
any
more
dear
if
i
were
you
the
mistress
was
whispering
you
see
if
it
had
been
for
lad
the
bull
would
never
have
broken
loose
in
the
first
place
by
another
that
fact
may
dawn
on
glure
if
you
keep
rubbing
it
in
let
go
over
to
the
grand
stand
come
lad
chapter
x
the
killer
one
of
the
jolliest
minutes
in
lad
daily
tramp
with
the
mistress
and
the
master
was
his
dash
up
mount
pisgah
this
mount
was
little
more
than
a
foothill
it
was
treeless
and
covered
with
short
grass
and
mullein
a
slope
where
no
crop
but
buckwheat
could
be
expected
to
thrive
it
rose
out
of
the
adjoining
mountain
forests
in
a
long
and
sweeping
ascent
here
with
no
trees
or
undergrowth
to
impede
him
lad
from
puppyhood
had
ordained
a
racecourse
of
his
own
as
he
neared
the
hill
he
would
always
dash
forward
at
top
speed
flying
up
the
rise
like
a
tawny
whirlwind
at
unabated
pace
until
he
stopped
panting
and
gloriously
excited
on
the
summit
to
await
his
human
escorts
one
morning
in
early
summer
lad
as
usual
bounded
ahead
of
the
mistress
and
the
master
as
they
drew
near
to
the
treeless
mount
and
as
ever
he
rushed
gleefully
forward
for
his
daily
breather
up
the
long
slope
but
before
he
had
gone
fifty
yards
he
came
to
a
scurrying
halt
and
stood
at
gaze
his
back
was
bristling
and
his
lips
curled
back
from
his
white
teeth
in
sudden
annoyance
his
keen
nostrils
even
before
his
eyes
told
him
something
was
amiss
with
his
cherished
the
eddying
shift
of
the
breeze
from
west
to
north
had
brought
to
his
nose
the
odor
which
had
checked
his
onrush
an
odor
that
wakened
all
sorts
of
vaguely
formless
memories
far
back
in
lad
brain
and
which
he
did
not
at
all
care
for
scent
is
ten
times
stronger
to
a
dog
than
is
sight
the
best
dog
is
near
sighted
and
the
worst
dog
has
a
magic
sense
of
smell
wherefore
a
dog
almost
always
uses
his
nose
first
and
his
eyes
last
which
lad
now
proceeded
to
do
above
him
was
the
pale
green
hillside
up
which
he
loved
to
gallop
but
its
surface
was
no
longer
smoothly
unencumbered
instead
it
was
dotted
and
starred
singly
or
in
groups
with
fluffy
creatures
lad
was
almost
abreast
of
the
lowest
group
of
sheep
when
he
paused
several
of
the
feeding
animals
lifted
their
heads
snortingly
from
the
short
herbage
at
sight
of
him
and
fled
up
the
hill
the
rest
of
the
flock
joined
them
in
the
silly
stampede
the
dog
made
no
move
to
follow
instead
his
forehead
creased
and
his
eyes
troubled
he
stared
after
the
surge
that
swept
upward
toward
the
summit
of
his
favored
coursing
ground
the
mistress
and
the
master
too
at
sight
of
the
woolly
avalanche
stopped
and
stared
from
over
the
brow
of
mount
pisgah
appeared
the
figure
of
a
man
in
blue
denim
overalls
one
titus
romaine
owner
of
the
hill
drawn
by
the
noisy
multiple
patter
of
his
hoofs
he
emerged
from
under
a
hilltop
boulder
shade
to
learn
the
cause
of
their
flight
now
in
all
his
life
lad
had
seen
sheep
just
once
before
that
one
exception
had
been
when
hamilcar
glure
the
wall
street
farmer
had
corralled
a
little
herd
of
his
prize
merinos
overnight
at
the
place
on
the
way
to
the
paterson
livestock
show
on
that
occasion
the
sheep
had
broken
from
the
corral
and
lad
acting
on
ancestral
instinct
had
rounded
them
up
without
injuring
or
scaring
one
of
them
the
memory
was
not
pleasing
to
lad
and
he
wanted
nothing
more
to
do
with
such
stupid
creatures
indeed
as
he
looked
now
upon
the
sheep
that
were
obstructing
his
run
he
felt
a
distinct
aversion
to
them
whining
a
little
he
trotted
back
to
where
stood
the
mistress
and
the
master
and
as
they
waited
titus
romaine
bore
wrathfully
down
upon
them
i
been
expectin
something
like
that
announced
the
ever
since
i
turned
these
critters
out
here
this
mornin
i
surprised
a
bit
i
what
is
it
you
been
expecting
romaine
asked
the
master
and
how
long
have
you
been
a
a
sheep
here
in
the
north
jersey
hinterland
is
as
rare
as
i
been
expectin
some
savage
dog
would
be
runnin
retorted
the
farmer
just
like
i
read
they
do
an
now
i
caught
him
at
it
caught
at
queried
the
perplexed
mistress
failing
to
note
the
man
baleful
glower
at
the
contemptuous
lad
that
big
ugly
brute
of
of
course
declared
romaine
i
caught
him
runnin
my
sheep
he
lad
did
nothing
of
the
kind
denied
the
mistress
the
instant
he
caught
sight
of
them
he
stopped
running
lad
would
hurt
anything
that
is
weak
and
helpless
your
sheep
saw
him
and
they
ran
away
he
did
follow
them
an
inch
i
seen
what
i
seen
cryptically
answered
the
man
an
i
give
you
fair
warnin
if
any
of
my
sheep
is
killed
i
know
right
where
to
come
to
look
for
the
killer
if
you
mean
lad
began
the
master
hotly
but
the
mistress
intervened
i
am
glad
you
have
decided
to
raise
sheep
romaine
she
said
everyone
ought
to
who
can
i
read
only
the
other
day
that
america
is
using
up
more
sheep
than
it
can
breed
and
that
the
price
of
fodder
and
the
scarcity
of
pasture
were
doing
terrible
things
to
the
supply
i
hope
you
have
all
sorts
of
good
luck
and
you
are
wise
to
watch
your
sheep
so
closely
but
do
be
afraid
of
lad
harming
any
of
them
he
would
for
worlds
i
know
because
i
know
lad
come
along
laddie
she
finished
as
she
turned
to
go
away
but
titus
romaine
stopped
her
i
put
a
sight
of
money
into
this
flock
of
sheep
he
declared
i
could
reely
afford
an
i
been
readin
up
on
sheep
too
i
been
readin
that
the
worst
to
sheep
is
dogs
an
if
that
big
dog
of
ai
then
i
never
seen
one
that
was
so
i
warnin
you
fair
if
your
sheep
come
to
any
harm
romaine
returned
the
mistress
again
forestalling
an
untactful
outbreak
from
her
husband
guarantee
lad
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
an
i
guarantee
to
have
him
shot
an
have
you
folks
up
in
court
if
he
does
chivalrously
retorted
titus
romaine
with
which
exchange
of
goodfellowship
the
two
groups
parted
romaine
returning
to
his
scattered
sheep
while
the
mistress
lad
at
her
heels
lured
the
master
away
from
the
field
of
encounter
the
master
was
fuming
here
where
good
old
trouble
drops
in
on
us
for
a
nice
long
visit
he
grumbled
as
they
moved
homeward
i
can
see
how
it
is
going
to
turn
out
because
a
few
stray
curs
have
chased
or
killed
sheep
now
and
then
every
decent
dog
is
under
suspicion
as
a
if
one
of
romaine
wethers
gets
a
scratch
on
its
leg
from
a
bramble
lad
will
be
blamed
if
one
of
the
mongrels
from
over
in
the
village
should
chase
his
sheep
lad
will
be
accused
and
be
in
the
first
squabble
of
our
lives
the
master
spoke
with
a
pessimism
his
wife
did
not
share
and
which
he
himself
did
not
really
believe
the
folk
at
the
place
had
always
lived
in
goodfellowship
and
peace
with
their
few
rural
neighbors
as
well
as
with
the
several
hundred
inhabitants
of
the
village
across
the
lake
and
though
livestock
is
the
foundation
of
ninety
rustic
feuds
out
of
the
dogs
of
the
place
had
never
involved
their
owners
in
any
such
row
yet
barely
three
days
later
titus
romaine
bore
down
upon
the
place
before
breakfast
breathing
threatenings
and
complaining
of
slaughter
he
was
waiting
on
the
veranda
in
blasphemous
converse
with
the
foreman
when
the
master
came
out
at
titus
heels
stood
his
hired
man
a
huge
and
sullen
person
named
schwartz
who
possessed
a
accent
that
fitted
the
name
well
orated
romaine
in
glum
greeting
as
he
sighted
the
master
well
i
guessed
right
he
done
it
after
all
he
done
it
we
all
but
caught
him
got
away
with
four
of
my
best
sheep
four
of
the
cur
what
are
you
talking
about
demanded
the
master
as
the
mistress
drawn
by
the
visitor
plangent
tones
joined
the
that
ugly
big
dog
of
answered
romaine
i
knew
what
he
do
if
he
got
the
chance
i
knew
it
when
i
saw
him
runnin
my
poor
sheep
last
week
i
warned
you
then
the
two
of
you
an
now
he
done
it
done
what
insisted
the
master
impatient
of
the
man
noise
and
fury
what
dog
asked
the
mistress
at
the
same
time
are
you
talking
about
lad
if
you
are
i
talkin
about
your
big
brown
collie
cur
snorted
titus
gone
an
killed
four
of
my
best
sheep
did
it
in
the
night
an
early
this
mornin
my
man
here
caught
him
at
the
last
of
an
drove
him
off
just
as
he
was
finishin
the
poor
critter
he
got
away
with
the
rest
of
nonsense
denied
the
master
you
talking
rot
lad
would
touch
a
sheep
and
that
what
all
folks
say
when
their
dogs
or
their
children
is
charged
with
doin
wrong
scoffed
romaine
but
this
time
it
wo
do
no
good
to
you
say
this
happened
last
night
interposed
the
mistress
yes
it
did
last
night
an
early
in
the
mornin
too
schwartz
here
but
lad
sleeps
in
the
house
every
night
objected
the
mistress
he
sleeps
under
the
piano
in
the
music
room
he
has
slept
there
every
night
since
he
was
a
puppy
the
maid
who
dusts
the
downstairs
rooms
before
breakfast
lets
him
out
when
she
begins
work
so
he
bolster
it
up
any
way
you
like
broke
in
romaine
he
was
out
last
night
all
right
an
early
this
morning
too
how
early
questioned
the
master
five
volunteered
schwartz
speaking
up
from
behind
his
employer
i
know
because
that
the
time
i
get
up
i
went
out
first
thing
to
open
the
barnyard
gate
and
drive
the
sheep
to
the
pasture
first
thing
i
saw
was
that
big
dog
growling
over
a
sheep
just
killed
he
saw
me
and
he
wiggled
out
through
the
barnyard
bars
same
way
he
had
got
in
then
i
counted
the
sheep
one
was
dead
the
one
he
had
just
killed
and
three
were
gone
we
been
looking
for
their
bodies
ever
since
and
we
ca
find
them
i
suppose
lad
swallowed
them
ironically
put
in
the
foreman
that
makes
about
as
much
sense
as
the
rest
of
the
yarn
the
old
dog
would
no
sooner
do
you
really
mean
to
say
you
saw
lad
saw
and
him
in
titus
barnyard
growling
over
a
sheep
he
had
just
killed
demanded
the
mistress
i
sure
do
affirmed
schwartz
and
i
an
he
ready
to
go
on
th
stand
an
take
oath
to
it
supplemented
titus
unless
you
pay
me
the
damages
out
of
court
them
sheep
cost
me
a
head
in
the
market
one
week
ago
sheep
on
the
hoof
has
gone
up
a
full
forty
cents
more
since
then
you
owe
me
for
them
four
sheep
i
owe
you
not
one
red
cent
denied
the
master
i
hate
law
worse
than
i
hate
measles
but
i
fight
that
idiotic
claim
all
the
way
up
to
the
appellate
division
before
i
the
mistress
lifted
a
little
silver
whistle
that
hung
at
her
belt
and
blew
it
an
instant
later
lad
came
galloping
gaily
up
the
lawn
from
the
lake
adrip
with
water
from
his
morning
swim
straight
at
the
mistress
summons
he
came
and
stood
expectant
in
front
of
her
oblivious
of
others
the
great
dog
coat
shone
wetly
in
the
sunshine
every
line
of
his
splendid
body
was
tense
his
eyes
looked
up
into
the
face
of
the
loved
mistress
in
eager
anticipation
for
a
usually
involved
some
matter
of
more
than
common
interest
that
the
dog
cried
schwartz
his
thick
voice
betraying
a
shade
more
of
its
german
accent
in
the
excitement
of
the
minute
that
the
one
he
has
washed
off
the
blood
but
that
is
the
one
i
could
know
him
anywhere
at
all
and
i
knew
him
already
and
romaine
told
me
to
be
looking
out
for
him
about
the
sheep
too
so
i
the
master
had
bent
over
lad
examining
the
dog
mouth
not
a
trace
of
blood
or
of
wool
he
announced
and
look
how
he
faces
us
if
he
had
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
i
got
a
witness
to
prove
he
killed
my
sheep
cut
in
romaine
since
you
wo
be
honest
enough
to
square
the
case
out
of
court
then
the
law
take
a
tuck
in
your
wallet
for
you
the
law
will
look
after
a
poor
man
i
do
wonder
there
folks
who
want
all
dogs
done
with
pesky
curs
here
the
papers
say
we
are
short
on
sheep
an
they
beg
us
to
raise
because
mutton
is
worth
double
what
it
used
to
be
in
open
market
then
when
i
buy
sheep
on
that
sayso
your
dog
gets
four
of
the
very
first
week
think
what
them
four
sheep
would
meant
to
i
sorry
you
lost
them
the
master
interrupted
mighty
sorry
and
i
still
sorrier
if
there
is
a
dog
at
large
anywhere
in
this
region
but
lad
never
i
tell
ye
he
stormed
titus
i
got
proof
of
it
proof
good
enough
for
any
court
an
the
court
is
goin
to
see
me
righted
it
goin
to
do
more
it
goin
to
make
you
shoot
that
killer
there
too
i
know
the
law
i
looked
it
up
an
the
law
says
if
a
dog
lad
is
not
a
dog
flashed
the
mistress
that
what
he
is
snarled
romaine
an
by
law
he
be
shot
as
sech
he
take
your
case
to
law
then
retorted
the
master
whose
last
shred
of
patience
went
by
the
board
at
the
threat
and
take
it
and
yourself
off
my
place
lad
does
sheep
but
at
the
word
from
me
he
ask
nothing
better
than
to
you
and
your
german
every
step
of
the
way
to
your
own
woodshed
clear
out
he
and
the
mistress
watched
the
two
irately
mumbling
intruders
plod
out
of
sight
up
the
drive
lad
at
the
master
side
viewed
the
accusers
departure
with
sharp
interest
schooled
in
reading
the
human
voice
he
had
listened
alertly
to
the
master
speech
of
dismissal
and
as
the
dog
listened
his
teeth
had
come
slowly
into
view
from
beneath
a
menacingly
upcurled
lip
his
eyes
half
shut
had
been
fixed
on
titus
with
an
expression
that
was
not
pretty
oh
dear
sighed
the
mistress
miserably
as
she
and
her
husband
turned
indoors
and
made
their
way
toward
the
breakfast
room
you
were
right
about
old
trouble
dropping
in
on
us
is
it
horrible
but
it
makes
my
blood
boil
to
think
of
laddie
being
accused
of
such
a
thing
it
is
crazily
absurd
of
course
but
absurd
the
master
caught
her
up
it
the
most
absurd
thing
i
ever
heard
of
if
it
was
about
any
other
dog
than
lad
it
would
be
good
for
a
laugh
i
mean
romaine
charge
of
the
dog
doing
away
with
no
less
than
four
sheep
and
not
leaving
a
trace
of
more
than
one
of
them
that
alone
would
get
his
case
laughed
out
of
court
i
remember
once
in
scotland
i
was
stopping
with
some
people
whose
shepherd
complained
that
three
of
the
sheep
had
fallen
victim
to
a
we
all
went
up
to
the
to
look
at
them
they
were
a
pretty
sight
but
they
were
all
a
dog
does
devour
a
sheep
he
kills
he
does
even
lug
it
away
instead
he
just
perhaps
you
rather
describe
it
breakfast
suggested
the
mistress
hurriedly
this
wretched
business
has
taken
away
all
of
my
appetite
that
i
can
comfortably
spare
at
about
of
the
next
day
the
master
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
this
is
maclay
said
the
voice
at
the
far
end
why
hello
mac
responded
the
master
mildly
wondering
why
his
old
the
village
local
peace
justice
should
be
calling
him
up
at
such
an
hour
if
you
going
to
tell
me
this
is
a
good
day
for
bass
to
bite
i
going
to
tell
you
it
is
it
because
i
up
to
my
neck
in
work
besides
it
too
late
for
the
morning
fishing
and
too
early
for
the
bass
to
get
up
their
afternoon
appetites
so
do
try
to
tempt
me
into
hold
on
broke
in
maclay
i
not
calling
you
up
for
that
calling
up
on
business
rotten
unpleasant
business
too
what
wrong
asked
the
master
i
hoping
titus
romaine
is
said
the
justice
he
just
been
here
with
his
north
prussian
hired
man
as
witness
to
make
a
complaint
about
your
dog
lad
yes
and
to
get
a
court
order
to
have
the
old
fellow
shot
too
what
sputtered
the
master
he
has
actually
that
just
what
he
done
said
maclay
he
claims
lad
killed
four
of
his
new
sheep
night
before
last
and
four
more
of
them
this
morning
or
last
night
schwartz
swears
he
caught
lad
at
the
last
of
the
killed
sheep
both
times
it
hard
luck
old
man
and
i
feel
as
bad
about
it
as
if
it
were
my
own
dog
you
know
how
strong
i
am
for
lad
he
the
greatest
collie
i
known
but
the
law
is
clear
in
such
you
speak
as
if
you
thought
lad
was
guilty
flamed
the
master
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
he
schwartz
tells
a
straight
story
answered
maclay
sadly
and
he
tells
it
under
oath
he
swears
he
recognized
lad
first
time
he
says
he
volunteered
to
watch
in
the
barnyard
last
night
he
had
had
a
hard
day
work
and
he
fell
asleep
while
he
was
on
watch
he
says
he
woke
up
in
gray
dawn
to
find
the
whole
flock
in
a
turmoil
and
lad
pinning
one
of
the
sheep
to
the
ground
he
had
already
killed
three
schwartz
drove
him
away
three
of
the
sheep
were
missing
one
lad
had
just
downed
was
dying
romaine
swears
he
saw
lad
his
sheep
last
week
it
what
did
you
do
about
the
case
asked
the
dazed
master
i
told
them
to
be
at
the
courtroom
at
three
this
afternoon
with
the
bodies
of
the
two
dead
sheep
that
are
missing
and
that
i
notify
you
to
be
there
too
oh
i
be
there
snapped
the
master
do
worry
and
it
was
decent
of
you
to
make
them
wait
the
whole
thing
is
ridiculous
it
of
course
went
on
maclay
either
side
can
easily
appeal
from
any
decision
i
make
that
is
as
regards
damages
but
by
the
new
i
sorry
to
say
there
is
any
appeal
from
the
local
justice
decree
that
a
dog
must
be
shot
at
once
the
law
leaves
me
no
option
if
i
consider
a
dog
guilty
of
i
have
to
order
such
a
dog
put
to
death
at
once
that
what
making
me
so
blue
i
rather
lose
a
year
pay
than
have
to
order
old
lad
killed
you
wo
have
to
declared
the
master
stoutly
albeit
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
nasty
sinking
in
the
vicinity
of
his
stomach
we
manage
to
prove
him
innocent
i
stake
anything
you
like
on
that
talk
the
case
over
with
dick
colfax
or
any
other
good
lawyer
before
three
suggested
maclay
there
may
be
a
legal
loophole
out
of
the
muddle
i
hope
to
the
lord
there
is
we
not
going
to
crawl
out
through
any
lad
and
i
returned
the
master
we
going
to
come
through
see
if
we
do
leaving
the
telephone
he
went
in
search
of
the
mistress
and
more
and
more
disheartened
told
her
the
story
the
worst
of
it
is
he
finished
romaine
and
schwartz
seem
to
have
made
maclay
believe
their
fool
yarn
that
is
because
they
believe
it
themselves
said
the
mistress
and
because
just
as
soon
as
even
the
most
sensible
man
is
made
a
judge
he
seems
to
lose
all
his
common
sense
and
intuition
and
become
nothing
but
a
walking
but
you
you
think
for
a
moment
do
you
that
they
can
persuade
judge
maclay
to
have
lad
shot
she
spoke
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
sweet
voice
that
roused
all
the
master
fighting
spirit
this
place
is
going
to
be
in
a
state
of
siege
against
the
entire
law
and
militia
of
new
jersey
he
announced
before
one
bullet
goes
into
lad
you
can
put
your
mind
to
rest
on
that
but
that
is
enough
i
want
to
him
in
these
days
of
and
scarcity
it
is
a
grave
offense
to
destroy
any
and
the
loss
of
eight
sheep
in
two
days
in
a
district
where
there
has
been
such
an
effort
made
to
revive
sheep
raising
did
you
say
they
claim
the
second
lot
of
sheep
were
killed
in
the
night
and
at
dawn
just
as
they
said
the
first
were
interposed
the
mistress
why
yes
but
then
said
the
mistress
much
more
comfortably
we
can
prove
alibi
just
as
i
said
yesterday
we
could
marie
always
lets
him
out
in
the
morning
when
she
comes
downstairs
to
dust
these
lower
rooms
never
down
before
six
and
the
sun
nowadays
rises
long
before
that
schwartz
says
he
saw
lad
both
times
in
the
early
dawn
we
can
prove
by
marie
that
lad
was
safe
here
in
the
house
till
long
after
sunrise
her
worried
frown
gave
way
to
a
smile
of
positive
inspiration
the
master
own
darkling
face
cleared
good
he
approved
i
think
that
cinches
it
marie
been
with
us
for
years
her
word
is
certainly
as
good
as
a
boche
farmhand
even
maclay
temperament
will
have
to
admit
that
send
her
in
here
wo
you
when
the
maid
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
study
a
minute
later
the
master
opened
the
examination
with
the
solemn
air
of
a
legal
veteran
you
are
the
first
person
down
here
in
the
mornings
are
you
marie
he
began
why
yes
sir
replied
the
wondering
maid
yes
always
except
when
you
get
up
early
to
go
fishing
or
when
what
time
do
you
get
down
here
in
the
mornings
pursued
the
master
along
about
six
sir
mostly
said
the
maid
bridling
a
bit
as
if
scenting
a
criticism
of
her
not
earlier
than
six
asked
the
master
no
sir
said
marie
uncomfortably
of
course
if
that
not
early
enough
i
suppose
i
could
it
quite
early
enough
vouchsafed
the
master
there
is
no
complaint
about
your
hours
you
always
let
lad
out
as
soon
as
you
come
into
the
music
room
yes
sir
she
answered
as
soon
as
i
get
downstairs
those
were
the
orders
you
remember
the
master
breathed
a
silent
sigh
of
relief
the
maid
did
not
get
downstairs
until
six
the
dog
then
could
not
get
out
of
the
house
until
that
hour
if
schwartz
had
seen
any
dog
in
the
romaine
barnyard
at
daybreak
it
assuredly
was
not
lad
yet
racking
his
brain
the
master
could
not
recall
any
other
dog
in
the
vicinity
that
bore
even
the
faintest
semblance
to
his
giant
collie
and
he
fell
to
recalling
from
his
happy
memories
of
son
of
that
killers
often
travel
many
miles
from
home
to
sate
their
mania
for
in
any
event
it
was
no
concern
of
his
if
some
distant
collie
drawn
to
the
slaughter
by
the
queer
sixth
was
killing
romaine
new
flock
of
sheep
lad
was
cleared
the
maid
very
evidently
true
testimony
settled
that
point
yes
sir
rambled
on
marie
beginning
to
take
a
faint
interest
in
the
examination
now
that
it
turned
upon
lad
whom
she
loved
yes
sir
laddie
always
comes
out
from
under
his
piano
the
minute
he
hears
my
step
in
the
hall
outside
and
he
always
comes
right
up
to
me
and
wags
that
big
plume
of
a
tail
of
his
and
falls
into
step
alongside
of
me
and
walks
over
to
the
front
door
right
beside
me
all
the
way
he
knows
as
much
as
many
a
human
that
dog
does
sir
encouraged
by
the
master
approving
nod
the
maid
ventured
to
enlarge
still
further
upon
the
theme
it
always
seems
as
if
he
was
welcoming
me
downstairs
like
she
resumed
and
glad
to
see
me
i
really
missed
him
quite
bad
this
past
few
mornings
the
approving
look
on
the
master
face
gave
way
to
a
glare
of
utter
blankness
this
past
few
mornings
he
repeated
blitheringly
what
do
you
mean
why
she
returned
flustered
afresh
by
the
quick
change
in
her
interlocutor
manner
ever
since
those
french
windows
are
left
open
for
the
night
same
as
they
always
are
when
the
hot
weather
starts
in
you
know
sir
since
then
laddie
do
wait
for
me
to
let
him
out
when
he
wakes
up
he
just
goes
out
himself
he
used
to
do
that
last
year
too
sir
he
thanks
muttered
the
master
dizzily
that
all
thanks
left
alone
he
sat
slumped
low
in
his
chair
trying
to
think
he
was
as
calmly
convinced
as
ever
of
his
dog
innocence
but
he
had
staked
everything
on
marie
court
testimony
and
now
that
testimony
was
rendered
worse
than
worthless
crankily
he
cursed
his
own
mania
which
had
decreed
that
the
long
windows
on
the
ground
floor
be
left
open
on
summer
nights
with
lad
on
duty
the
house
was
as
safe
from
successful
burglary
in
spite
of
these
open
windows
as
if
guarded
by
a
squad
of
special
policemen
and
the
sweeping
through
kept
it
pleasantly
cool
against
the
next
day
heat
for
this
same
coolness
a
heavy
price
was
now
due
presently
the
daze
of
disappointment
passed
leaving
the
master
pulsing
with
a
wholesome
rapidly
he
revised
his
defense
and
with
the
mistress
far
cleverer
aid
made
ready
for
the
ordeal
he
scouted
maclay
suggestion
of
hiring
counsel
and
vowed
to
handle
the
defense
himself
carefully
he
and
his
wife
went
over
their
proposed
line
of
action
peace
justice
maclay
court
was
held
daily
in
a
rambling
room
on
an
upper
floor
of
the
village
odd
fellows
hall
the
proceedings
there
were
generally
marked
by
shrewd
sanity
rather
than
by
any
effort
at
formalism
maclay
himself
sat
at
a
battered
little
desk
at
the
room
far
end
his
clerk
using
a
corner
of
the
same
desk
for
the
scribbling
of
his
sketchy
notes
in
front
of
the
desk
was
a
rather
long
deal
table
with
kitchen
chairs
around
it
here
plaintiffs
and
defendants
and
prisoners
and
witnesses
and
lawyers
were
wont
to
sit
with
no
order
of
precedent
or
of
other
formality
several
other
chairs
were
ranged
irregularly
along
the
wall
to
accommodate
any
overflow
of
the
table
occupants
promptly
at
three
that
afternoon
the
mistress
and
the
master
entered
the
courtroom
close
at
the
mistress
side
though
held
by
no
leash
paced
lad
maclay
and
romaine
and
schwartz
were
already
on
hand
so
were
the
clerk
and
the
constable
and
one
or
two
idle
spectators
at
a
corner
of
the
room
wrapped
in
burlap
were
huddled
the
bodies
of
the
two
slain
sheep
lad
caught
the
scent
of
the
victims
the
instant
he
set
foot
in
the
room
and
he
sniffed
vibrantly
once
or
twice
titus
romaine
his
eyes
fixed
scowlingly
on
the
dog
noted
this
and
he
nudged
schwartz
in
the
ribs
to
call
the
german
attention
to
it
lad
turned
aside
in
fastidious
disgust
from
the
bumpy
burlap
bundle
seeing
the
judge
and
recognizing
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
the
collie
wagged
his
plumed
tail
in
gravely
friendly
greeting
and
stepped
forward
for
a
pat
on
the
head
lad
called
the
mistress
softly
at
the
word
the
dog
paused
midway
to
the
embarrassed
maclay
desk
and
obediently
turned
back
the
constable
was
drawing
up
a
chair
at
the
deal
table
for
the
mistress
lad
curled
down
beside
her
resting
one
snowy
little
forepaw
protectingly
on
her
slippered
foot
and
the
hearing
began
romaine
repeated
his
account
of
the
collie
alleged
depredations
starting
with
lad
first
view
of
the
sheep
schwartz
methodically
retold
his
own
story
of
twice
witnessing
the
killing
of
sheep
by
the
dog
the
master
did
not
interrupt
either
narrative
though
on
later
questioning
he
forced
the
sulkily
truthful
romaine
to
admit
he
had
not
actually
seen
lad
chase
the
that
morning
on
mount
pisgah
but
had
merely
seen
the
sheep
running
and
the
dog
standing
at
the
looking
upward
at
their
scattering
flight
both
the
mistress
and
the
master
swore
that
the
dog
on
that
occasion
had
made
no
move
to
pursue
or
otherwise
harass
the
sheep
thus
did
lad
win
one
point
in
the
case
but
in
view
of
the
wherewith
he
was
charged
the
point
was
of
decidedly
trivial
value
even
if
he
had
not
attacked
the
flock
on
his
first
view
of
them
he
was
accused
of
killing
no
less
than
eight
of
their
number
on
two
later
encounters
and
schwartz
was
an
to
this
schwartz
whose
testimony
was
as
clear
and
as
simple
as
daylight
with
a
glance
of
apology
at
the
mistress
judge
maclay
ordered
the
taken
from
their
burlap
cerements
and
laid
on
the
table
for
while
he
and
schwartz
arranged
the
grisly
exhibits
for
the
view
titus
romaine
expatiated
loudly
on
the
value
of
the
murdered
sheep
and
on
the
brutally
useless
wastage
in
their
slaying
the
master
said
nothing
but
he
bent
over
each
of
the
sheep
carefully
studying
the
at
last
he
straightened
himself
up
from
his
task
and
broke
in
on
romaine
by
saying
quietly
your
honor
these
sheep
throats
were
not
cut
by
a
dog
neither
by
lad
nor
by
any
look
for
yourself
i
seen
sheep
the
wounds
were
not
at
all
like
these
not
killed
by
a
dog
hey
loudly
scoffed
romaine
i
they
was
chewed
by
lightnin
then
or
maybe
they
was
bit
by
a
skeeter
huh
they
were
not
bitten
at
all
countered
the
master
still
less
were
they
chewed
look
those
gashes
are
ragged
enough
but
they
are
as
straight
as
if
they
were
made
by
a
machine
if
ever
you
have
seen
a
dog
worry
a
piece
of
meat
rubbish
grunted
titus
you
talk
like
a
fool
the
sheeps
throats
is
torn
schwartz
seen
your
cur
tear
that
all
there
is
to
it
whether
he
tore
straight
or
whether
he
tore
crooked
count
in
law
he
an
i
got
a
witness
to
prove
it
your
honor
said
the
master
suddenly
may
i
interrogate
the
witness
maclay
nodded
the
master
turned
to
schwartz
who
faced
him
in
stolid
composure
schwartz
began
the
master
you
say
it
was
light
enough
for
you
to
recognize
the
dog
both
mornings
in
romaine
barnyard
how
near
to
him
did
you
get
schwartz
pondered
for
a
second
then
made
careful
answer
first
time
i
ran
into
the
barnyard
from
the
house
side
and
your
dog
cut
and
run
out
of
it
from
the
far
side
when
he
saw
me
making
for
him
that
time
i
do
think
i
got
within
thirty
feet
of
him
but
i
was
near
enough
to
see
him
plain
and
i
seen
him
often
enough
before
on
the
road
or
in
your
car
so
i
knew
him
all
right
the
next
time
this
morning
judge
i
was
within
five
feet
of
him
or
even
nearer
for
i
was
near
enough
to
hit
him
with
the
stick
i
just
picked
up
and
to
land
a
kick
on
his
ribs
as
he
started
away
i
saw
him
then
as
plain
as
i
see
you
and
nearer
than
i
am
to
you
and
the
light
was
good
enough
to
read
by
too
yes
queried
the
master
if
i
remember
rightly
you
told
judge
maclay
that
you
were
on
watch
last
night
in
the
cowshed
just
alongside
the
barnyard
where
the
sheep
were
and
you
fell
asleep
and
woke
just
in
time
to
see
a
dog
to
see
your
dog
corrected
schwartz
to
see
a
dog
growling
over
a
squirming
and
bleating
sheep
he
had
pulled
down
how
far
away
from
you
was
he
when
you
awoke
just
outside
the
cowshed
door
not
six
feet
from
me
i
ups
with
the
stick
i
had
with
me
and
ran
out
at
him
and
were
he
and
the
sheep
making
much
noise
between
they
was
making
enough
racket
to
wake
a
dead
man
replied
schwartz
what
with
your
dog
snarling
and
growling
and
the
poor
sheep
and
all
the
other
sheep
yet
you
say
he
had
killed
three
sheep
while
you
slept
there
had
killed
them
and
carried
or
dragged
their
bodies
away
and
come
back
again
and
presumably
started
a
noisy
panic
in
the
flock
every
time
and
none
of
that
racket
waked
you
until
the
fourth
sheep
was
killed
i
was
declared
schwartz
i
been
at
work
in
our
for
ten
hours
the
day
before
and
up
since
five
romaine
can
tell
you
i
a
hard
man
to
wake
at
best
i
sleep
like
the
dead
that
right
assented
titus
time
an
again
i
have
to
bang
at
his
door
an
holler
myself
hoarse
before
i
can
get
him
to
open
his
eyes
my
wife
says
he
the
sleeper
you
ran
out
of
the
shed
with
your
stick
resumed
the
master
and
struck
the
dog
before
he
could
get
away
and
as
he
turned
to
run
you
kicked
him
yes
sir
that
what
i
did
how
hard
did
you
hit
him
a
pretty
good
lick
answered
schwartz
with
reminiscent
satisfaction
then
i
and
when
you
hit
him
he
slunk
away
like
a
whipped
cur
he
made
no
move
to
resent
it
i
mean
he
did
not
try
to
attack
you
not
him
asserted
schwartz
i
guess
he
was
glad
enough
to
get
out
of
reach
he
slunk
away
so
fast
i
hardly
had
a
chance
to
land
fair
on
him
when
i
kicked
here
is
my
said
the
master
take
it
please
and
strike
lad
with
it
just
as
you
struck
him
or
the
dog
with
your
stick
just
as
hard
lad
has
never
been
struck
except
once
unjustly
by
me
years
ago
he
has
never
needed
it
but
if
he
would
slink
away
like
a
whipped
mongrel
when
a
stranger
hits
him
the
sooner
he
is
beaten
to
death
the
better
hit
him
exactly
as
you
hit
him
this
morning
judge
maclay
his
lips
to
protest
he
knew
the
love
of
the
people
of
the
place
for
lad
and
he
wondered
at
this
invitation
to
a
farmhand
to
thrash
the
dog
publicly
he
glanced
at
the
mistress
her
face
was
calm
even
a
little
amused
evidently
the
master
request
did
not
horrify
or
surprise
her
schwartz
stubby
fingers
gripped
the
crop
the
master
forced
into
his
hand
with
true
teutonic
relish
for
he
swung
the
weapon
aloft
and
took
a
step
toward
the
lazily
recumbent
collie
striking
with
all
his
strength
then
with
speed
schwartz
took
three
steps
backward
for
at
the
menace
lad
had
leaped
to
his
feet
with
the
speed
of
a
fighting
wolf
eluding
the
descending
crop
as
it
swished
past
him
and
launching
himself
straight
for
the
wielder
throat
he
did
not
growl
he
did
not
pause
he
merely
sprang
for
his
assailant
with
a
deadly
ferocity
that
brought
a
cry
from
maclay
the
master
caught
the
huge
dog
midway
in
his
throatward
flight
down
lad
he
ordered
gently
the
collie
obedient
to
the
word
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
at
the
mistress
feet
but
he
kept
a
watchful
and
right
unloving
eye
on
the
man
who
had
struck
at
him
it
a
bit
odd
is
it
suggested
the
master
that
he
went
for
you
like
that
just
now
when
this
morning
he
slunk
away
from
your
blow
in
cringing
fear
why
would
he
growled
schwartz
his
stolid
nerve
shaken
by
the
unexpected
onslaught
his
folks
are
here
to
back
him
up
and
everything
why
would
he
go
for
me
he
was
slinky
enough
when
i
whaled
him
this
morning
h
mused
the
master
you
hit
a
strong
blow
schwartz
i
say
that
for
you
you
missed
lad
with
my
crop
but
you
split
the
crop
and
you
scored
a
visible
mark
on
the
wooden
floor
with
it
did
you
hit
as
hard
as
that
when
you
struck
the
this
morning
a
sight
harder
responded
schwartz
my
mad
was
up
i
a
dog
skin
is
softer
than
a
pine
floor
said
the
master
your
honor
such
a
blow
would
have
raised
a
weal
on
lad
flesh
an
inch
high
would
your
honor
mind
passing
your
hand
over
his
body
and
trying
to
locate
such
a
weal
this
is
all
outside
the
raged
the
annoyed
titus
romaine
you
the
issue
i
tell
ye
i
if
your
honor
please
insisted
the
master
the
judge
left
his
desk
and
whistled
lad
across
to
him
the
dog
looked
at
his
master
doubtfully
the
master
nodded
the
collie
arose
and
walked
in
leisurely
fashion
over
to
the
waiting
judge
maclay
ran
an
exploring
hand
through
the
magnificent
tawny
coat
from
head
to
haunch
then
along
the
dog
furry
sides
lad
hated
to
be
handled
by
anyone
but
the
mistress
or
the
master
but
at
a
soft
word
from
the
mistress
he
stood
stock
still
and
submitted
to
the
inspection
i
find
no
weal
or
any
other
mark
on
him
presently
reported
the
judge
the
mistress
smiled
happily
the
whole
investigation
up
to
this
point
and
further
was
along
eccentric
lines
she
herself
had
thought
out
and
had
suggested
to
her
husband
lines
suggested
by
her
knowledge
of
lad
schwartz
went
on
the
master
interrupting
another
fuming
outbreak
from
romaine
i
afraid
you
did
hit
quite
as
hard
as
you
thought
you
did
this
morning
or
else
some
other
dog
is
carrying
around
a
big
welt
on
his
flesh
now
for
the
kick
you
say
you
gave
the
collie
i
i
wo
copy
on
your
bloodthirsty
dog
vociferated
schwartz
not
even
if
the
judge
jails
me
for
contempt
i
wo
likely
kill
me
and
yet
he
ran
from
you
this
morning
the
master
reminded
him
well
i
wo
insist
on
your
kicking
lad
but
you
say
it
was
a
light
kick
because
he
was
running
away
when
it
landed
i
am
curious
to
know
just
how
hard
a
kick
it
was
in
fact
i
so
curious
about
it
that
i
am
going
to
offer
myself
as
a
substitute
for
lad
my
riding
boot
is
a
good
surface
will
you
kindly
kick
me
there
schwartz
as
nearly
as
possible
with
the
same
force
no
more
no
less
than
you
kicked
the
dog
i
protest
shouted
romaine
this
measly
tomfoolishness
is
if
your
honor
please
appealed
the
master
sharply
turning
from
the
bewildered
schwartz
to
the
no
less
dismayed
judge
maclay
was
on
his
feet
to
overrule
so
strange
a
request
but
there
was
keen
supplication
in
the
master
eye
that
made
the
judge
pause
maclay
glanced
again
at
the
mistress
in
spite
of
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
husband
kicked
her
face
wore
a
most
pleased
smile
the
judge
noted
though
that
she
was
stroking
lad
head
and
that
she
was
unobtrusively
turning
that
head
so
that
the
dog
faced
schwartz
now
then
adjured
the
master
whenever
you
ready
schwartz
a
german
does
get
a
chance
like
this
every
day
to
kick
an
american
and
i
promise
not
to
go
for
your
throat
as
laddie
tried
to
kick
away
awkwardly
shamblingly
schwartz
stepped
forward
urged
on
by
his
racial
veneration
for
the
law
and
perhaps
not
sorry
to
assail
the
man
whose
dog
had
tried
to
throttle
him
he
drew
back
his
broganed
left
foot
and
kicked
out
in
the
general
direction
of
the
calf
of
the
master
thick
riding
boot
the
kick
did
not
land
not
that
the
master
dodged
or
blocked
it
he
stood
moveless
and
grinning
expectantly
but
the
courtroom
shook
with
a
yell
a
yell
of
insane
fury
and
schwartz
drew
back
his
left
foot
in
sudden
terror
as
a
great
furry
shape
came
whizzing
through
the
air
at
him
the
sight
of
the
kick
at
his
worshipped
master
had
had
precisely
the
effect
on
lad
that
the
mistress
had
foreseen
when
she
planned
the
manoeuver
almost
any
good
dog
will
attack
a
man
who
seeks
to
strike
its
owner
and
lad
seemed
to
comprehend
that
a
kick
is
a
more
contemptuous
affront
than
is
a
blow
schwartz
kick
at
the
master
had
thrown
the
adoring
dog
into
a
maniac
rage
against
this
defiler
of
his
idol
the
memory
of
schwartz
blow
at
himself
was
as
nothing
to
it
it
aroused
in
the
collie
heart
a
deathless
against
the
man
as
the
mistress
had
known
it
would
the
mistress
sharp
command
and
the
master
hastily
outflung
arm
barely
sufficed
to
deflect
lad
charge
he
writhed
in
their
dual
grasp
snarling
furiously
his
eyes
red
his
every
giant
muscle
strained
to
get
at
the
cowering
schwartz
we
had
enough
of
this
imperatively
ordained
maclay
above
the
babel
of
titus
romaine
protests
in
spite
of
the
informality
of
hearing
this
is
a
court
of
law
not
a
i
i
crave
your
honor
pardon
apologized
the
master
i
was
merely
trying
to
show
that
lad
is
not
the
sort
of
dog
to
let
a
stranger
strike
and
kick
him
as
this
man
claims
to
have
done
with
impunity
i
think
i
have
shown
from
lad
own
regrettable
actions
that
it
was
some
other
dog
if
which
cheered
romaine
barnyard
this
morning
and
yesterday
morning
it
was
dog
cried
schwartz
getting
his
breath
in
a
swirl
of
anger
next
time
i
be
on
watch
with
a
shotgun
and
not
a
stick
i
there
ai
going
to
be
no
time
asserted
the
equally
angry
romaine
judge
i
call
on
you
to
order
that
shot
an
to
order
his
master
to
indemnify
me
for
th
loss
of
my
eight
killed
sheep
your
honor
suavely
protested
the
master
may
i
ask
you
to
listen
to
a
a
proposition
which
i
think
will
be
agreeable
to
romaine
as
well
as
to
myself
the
only
agree
to
is
the
shootin
of
that
cur
and
the
indemnifyin
of
me
for
my
sheep
persisted
romaine
maclay
waved
his
hand
for
order
then
turning
to
the
master
said
state
your
proposition
i
propose
began
the
master
that
lad
be
paroled
in
my
custody
for
the
space
of
hours
i
will
deposit
with
the
court
here
and
now
my
bond
for
the
sum
of
one
thousand
dollars
to
be
paid
on
demand
to
titus
romaine
if
one
or
more
of
his
sheep
are
killed
by
any
dog
during
that
space
of
time
the
crass
oddity
of
the
proposal
set
titus
leathery
mouth
ajar
even
the
judge
gasped
aloud
at
its
bizarre
terms
schwartz
looked
blank
until
little
by
little
the
purport
of
the
words
sank
into
his
slow
mind
then
he
permitted
himself
the
rare
luxury
of
a
chuckle
do
i
you
to
say
demanded
titus
romaine
of
the
master
that
if
i
agree
to
hold
up
this
case
for
hours
give
me
one
thousan
dollars
cash
for
any
sheep
of
mine
that
gets
killed
by
dogs
in
that
time
that
is
my
proposition
returned
the
master
to
cinch
it
i
let
you
make
out
the
written
arrangement
your
self
and
i
give
the
court
a
bond
for
the
money
at
once
with
instructions
that
the
sum
is
to
be
paid
to
you
if
you
lose
one
sheep
through
dogs
in
the
next
day
i
furthermore
agree
to
shoot
lad
myself
if
you
lose
one
or
more
sheep
in
that
time
and
in
that
way
i
forfeit
another
thousand
if
i
fail
to
keep
that
part
of
my
contract
how
about
it
i
agree
exclaimed
titus
schwartz
smile
by
this
time
threatened
to
split
his
broad
face
across
maclay
saw
the
mistress
cheek
whiten
a
little
but
her
aspect
betrayed
no
worry
over
the
possible
loss
of
a
thousand
dollars
and
the
far
more
painful
loss
of
the
dog
she
loved
when
romaine
and
schwartz
had
gone
the
master
tarried
a
moment
in
the
courtroom
i
ca
make
out
what
you
driving
at
maclay
told
him
but
you
seem
to
me
to
have
done
a
mighty
foolish
thing
to
get
a
thousand
dollars
romaine
is
capable
of
scouring
the
whole
country
for
a
dog
so
is
schwartz
if
only
to
get
lad
shot
did
you
see
the
way
schwartz
looked
at
lad
as
he
went
out
he
hates
him
yes
said
the
master
and
i
saw
the
way
lad
looked
at
lad
will
never
forget
that
kick
at
me
he
attack
schwartz
for
it
if
they
come
together
a
year
from
now
that
why
we
arranged
it
say
mac
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
big
favor
a
favor
that
comes
within
the
square
and
angle
of
your
work
i
want
you
to
go
fishing
with
me
better
come
over
to
dinner
and
be
prepared
to
spend
the
night
the
fishing
wo
start
till
about
twelve
twelve
echoed
maclay
why
man
nothing
but
catfish
will
bite
at
that
hour
and
i
you
mistaken
denied
the
master
much
bigger
fish
will
bite
bigger
take
my
word
for
that
my
wife
and
i
have
it
all
figured
out
i
not
asking
you
in
your
official
capacity
but
as
a
friend
i
need
you
mac
it
will
be
a
big
favor
to
me
and
if
not
wrong
there
be
sport
in
it
for
you
too
i
risking
a
thousand
dollars
and
my
dog
on
this
fishing
trip
wo
you
risk
a
night
sleep

ask
it
as
a
worthy
and
distressed
certainly
assented
the
wholly
perplexed
judge
impressed
but
i
do
get
your
idea
at
all
i
i
explain
it
before
we
start
promised
the
master
all
i
want
now
is
for
you
to
commit
yourself
to
the
scheme
if
it
fails
you
wo
lose
anything
except
your
sleep
thanks
for
saying
come
at
a
little
after
ten
that
night
the
last
light
in
titus
romaine
farmhouse
went
out
a
few
moments
later
the
master
got
up
from
a
rock
on
mount
pisgah
summit
on
which
he
and
maclay
had
been
sitting
for
the
past
hour
lad
at
their
feet
rose
expectantly
with
them
come
on
old
man
said
the
master
we
drop
down
there
now
it
probably
means
a
long
wait
for
us
but
it
better
to
be
too
soon
than
too
late
when
i
got
so
much
staked
if
we
seen
you
can
cut
and
run
lad
and
i
will
cover
your
retreat
and
see
you
are
recognized
steady
there
lad
keep
at
heel
stealthily
the
trio
made
their
way
down
the
hill
to
the
farmstead
at
its
farther
base
silently
they
crept
along
the
outer
fringe
of
the
until
they
came
opposite
the
bulk
of
the
barn
presently
their
slowly
cautious
progress
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
barnyard
and
to
the
rail
fence
which
surrounds
it
there
they
halted
from
within
the
yard
as
the
huddle
of
drowsy
sheep
caught
the
scent
of
the
dog
came
a
slight
stirring
but
after
a
moment
the
yard
was
quiet
again
get
that
whispered
the
master
his
mouth
close
to
ear
those
sheep
are
supposed
to
have
been
raided
by
a
for
the
past
two
nights
yet
the
smell
of
a
dog
does
even
make
them
bleat
if
they
had
been
attacked
by
dog
last
night
the
scent
of
lad
would
throw
them
into
a
panic
i
get
something
else
too
replied
maclay
in
the
same
soundless
whisper
and
i
ashamed
i
did
think
of
it
before
romaine
said
the
dog
wriggled
into
the
yard
through
the
bars
and
out
again
the
same
way
well
if
those
bars
were
wide
enough
apart
for
an
collie
like
lad
to
get
through
what
would
there
be
to
prevent
all
these
sheep
from
escaping
the
same
way
any
time
they
wanted
to
i
have
a
look
at
those
bars
before
i
pass
judgment
on
the
case
i
begin
to
be
glad
you
and
your
wife
coerced
me
into
this
adventure
of
course
the
sheep
could
have
gotten
through
the
same
bars
that
the
dog
did
answered
the
master
for
did
romaine
say
the
dog
not
only
got
through
but
dragged
three
dead
sheep
through
after
him
each
night
and
hid
them
somewhere
where
they
could
be
found
no
man
would
keep
sheep
in
a
pen
as
open
as
all
that
the
entire
story
is
full
of
lad
at
a
touch
from
his
master
had
lain
softly
down
at
the
feet
beside
the
fence
and
so
for
another
full
hour
the
three
waited
there
the
night
was
heavily
overcast
and
except
for
the
low
drone
of
distant
and
crickets
it
was
deathly
silent
heat
lightning
once
in
a
while
played
dimly
along
the
western
horizon
lucky
for
us
that
romaine
does
keep
a
dog
whispered
maclay
he
have
raised
the
alarm
before
we
got
within
a
hundred
yards
of
here
he
told
my
foreman
he
gave
his
mongrel
dog
away
when
he
stocked
himself
with
sheep
and
he
been
reading
a
lot
of
rot
about
dogs
being
too
his
dog
would
have
been
anything
but
a
touch
on
the
sleeve
from
maclay
silenced
the
rambling
whisper
through
the
stillness
a
house
door
shut
very
softly
not
far
away
an
instant
later
lad
growled
throatily
and
got
to
his
feet
tense
and
fiercely
eager
he
caught
schwartz
scent
whispered
the
master
exultantly
now
maybe
you
understand
why
i
made
the
man
try
to
kick
me
down
lad
at
the
stark
command
in
the
master
whisper
lad
dropped
to
earth
again
though
he
still
rumbled
deeply
in
his
throat
until
a
touch
from
the
master
fingers
and
a
repeated
silenced
him
the
hush
of
the
night
was
disturbed
once
more
very
faintly
this
time
by
the
muffled
padding
of
a
man
bare
feet
drawing
closer
to
the
barnyard
lad
as
he
heard
it
made
as
if
to
rise
the
master
tapped
him
lightly
on
the
head
and
the
dog
sank
to
the
ground
again
quivering
with
rage
the
clouds
had
piled
thicker
only
by
a
dim
pulsing
of
heat
lightning
could
the
watchers
discern
the
shadowy
outline
of
a
man
moving
silently
between
them
and
the
far
side
of
the
yard
by
the
tiny
glow
of
lightning
they
saw
his
silhouette
by
lad
almost
uncontrollable
trembling
they
knew
who
he
must
be
there
was
another
drowsy
stirring
of
the
sheep
checked
by
the
reassuring
mumble
of
a
voice
the
animals
seemed
to
know
and
except
for
the
stealthy
motion
of
groping
feet
the
barnyard
seemed
as
empty
of
human
life
as
before
perhaps
a
minute
later
another
of
lightning
revealed
the
intruder
to
the
two
men
who
crouched
behind
the
outer
angle
of
the
fence
he
had
come
out
of
the
yard
and
was
shuffling
away
but
he
was
fully
a
third
wider
of
shoulder
now
and
he
seemed
to
have
two
heads
as
his
silhouette
dimly
appeared
and
then
vanished
see
that
whispered
the
master
he
has
a
sheep
slung
over
his
back
probably
with
a
cloth
wrapped
around
its
head
to
keep
it
quiet
we
will
give
him
twenty
seconds
start
and
then
babbled
maclay
in
true
fever
of
excitement
worked
out
to
a
charm
but
how
in
the
blazes
can
we
track
him
through
this
dark
it
as
black
as
the
inside
of
a
cow
and
if
we
show
the
flashlights
trust
lad
to
track
him
rejoined
the
master
who
had
been
slipping
a
leash
around
the
dog
throat
that
what
the
old
fellow
here
for
he
has
a
kick
to
punish
he
would
follow
schwartz
through
the
sahara
desert
if
he
had
to
come
on
lad
at
a
word
from
the
master
sprang
to
the
end
of
the
leash
his
mighty
head
and
shoulders
straining
forward
the
master
reiterated
quiet
alone
kept
him
from
giving
tongue
and
thus
the
trio
started
the
pursuit
lad
went
in
a
geometrically
straight
line
swerving
not
an
inch
with
much
difficulty
held
back
to
the
slow
walk
on
which
the
master
insisted
there
was
more
than
one
reason
for
this
insistence
not
only
did
the
two
men
want
to
keep
far
enough
behind
schwartz
to
prevent
him
from
hearing
their
careful
steps
but
lad
course
was
so
uncompromisingly
straight
that
it
led
them
over
a
hundred
obstacles
and
gullies
which
required
all
sorts
of
skill
to
negotiate
for
at
least
two
miles
the
progress
continued
most
of
the
way
through
woods
at
last
with
a
gasp
the
master
found
himself
wallowing
in
a
bog
maclay
a
step
behind
him
also
plunged
splashingly
into
the
soggy
mire
what
the
matter
with
the
dog
grumpily
demanded
the
judge
led
us
into
the
pancake
hollow
swamp
schwartz
never
in
the
world
carried
a
ninety
pound
sheep
through
here
maybe
not
puffed
the
master
but
he
has
carried
it
over
one
of
the
paths
that
lead
through
this
marsh
lad
is
in
too
big
a
hurry
to
bother
about
paths
he
fifty
feet
above
them
on
a
little
knoll
a
lantern
shone
apparently
it
had
just
been
lighted
for
it
waxed
brighter
in
a
second
or
so
the
men
saw
it
and
strode
forward
at
top
speed
the
third
step
caused
maclay
to
stumble
over
a
hummock
and
land
noisily
on
all
fours
in
a
as
he
fell
he
swore
with
a
loud
distinctness
that
rang
through
the
swampy
stillnesses
like
a
pistol
shot
instantly
the
lantern
went
out
and
there
was
a
crashing
in
among
the
bushes
of
the
knoll
after
him
yelled
maclay
floundering
to
his
feet
he
escape
and
we
have
no
real
proof
who
he
is
or
the
master
still
in
sticky
mud
saw
the
futility
of
trying
to
catch
a
man
who
unimpeded
was
running
away
along
a
path
there
was
but
one
thing
left
to
do
and
the
master
did
it
loosening
the
leash
from
the
dog
collar
he
shouted
get
him
laddie
him
there
was
a
sound
as
of
a
cavalry
regiment
galloping
through
shallow
water
that
and
a
queerly
ecstatic
growl
and
the
collie
was
gone
as
fast
as
possible
the
two
men
made
for
the
base
of
the
knoll
they
had
drawn
forth
their
electric
torches
and
these
now
made
the
progress
much
swifter
and
easier
nevertheless
before
the
master
had
set
foot
on
the
first
bit
of
firm
ground
all
pandemonium
burst
forth
amid
the
darkness
above
and
in
front
of
him
the
turmoil
multiple
sounds
were
indescribable
blending
into
one
wild
cacophony
the
yells
and
stamping
of
a
man
the
bleats
of
sheep
the
tearing
of
underbrush
through
and
above
and
under
all
a
hideous
subnote
as
of
a
rabid
beast
worrying
its
prey
it
was
this
undercurrent
of
sound
which
put
wings
on
the
tired
feet
of
maclay
and
the
master
as
they
dashed
up
the
knoll
and
into
the
path
leading
east
from
it
it
spoke
of
unpleasant
not
to
say
gruesome
happenings
so
did
the
swift
change
of
the
victim
yells
from
wrath
to
mortal
terror
back
lad
called
the
master
pantingly
as
he
ran
back
let
him
and
as
he
cried
the
command
he
rounded
a
turn
in
the
wooded
path
prone
on
the
ground
writhing
like
a
cut
snake
and
frantically
seeking
to
guard
his
throat
with
his
slashed
forearm
sprawled
schwartz
crouching
above
him
right
unwillingly
obeying
the
belated
call
was
lad
the
dog
great
coat
was
his
bared
teeth
glinted
white
and
in
the
electric
flare
his
soft
eyes
were
blazing
back
repeated
the
master
back
here
absolute
obedience
was
the
first
and
foremost
of
the
place
few
simple
lad
had
learned
it
from
earliest
puppyhood
the
collie
still
shaking
all
over
with
the
effort
of
repressing
his
fury
turned
slowly
and
came
over
to
his
master
there
he
stood
stonily
awaiting
further
orders
maclay
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
hysterically
moaning
german
roughly
telling
him
that
the
dog
would
do
him
no
more
damage
and
at
the
same
time
making
a
quick
inspection
of
the
injuries
wrought
by
the
slashing
white
fangs
in
the
shielding
arm
and
its
shoulder
get
up
he
now
ordered
you
not
too
badly
hurt
to
stand
another
minute
and
he
have
gotten
through
to
your
throat
but
your
clothes
saved
you
from
anything
worse
than
a
few
ugly
get
up
stop
that
yowling
and
get
up
schwartz
gradually
lessened
his
dolorous
plaints
under
the
stern
authority
of
maclay
exhortations
presently
he
sat
up
nursing
his
lacerated
forearm
and
staring
about
him
at
sight
of
lad
he
shuddered
and
recognizing
maclay
he
broke
into
violent
and
speech
take
witness
judge
he
exclaimed
i
watched
the
barnyard
and
i
saw
that
schweinhund
steal
another
sheep
i
followed
him
and
when
he
got
here
he
dropped
the
sheep
and
went
for
me
he
very
bad
schwartz
disgustedly
reproved
maclay
very
bad
indeed
you
should
have
waited
a
minute
longer
and
thought
up
a
better
one
but
since
this
is
the
yarn
you
choose
to
tell
we
look
about
and
try
to
verify
it
the
sheep
for
instance
the
one
you
say
lad
carried
all
the
way
here
and
then
dropped
to
attack
you
i
seem
to
have
heard
a
sheep
bleating
a
few
moments
ago
several
sheep
in
fact
we
see
if
we
ca
find
the
one
lad
stole
schwartz
jumped
nervously
to
his
feet
stay
where
you
are
maclay
bade
him
we
wo
bother
a
tired
and
injured
man
to
help
in
our
search
turning
to
the
master
he
added
i
suppose
one
of
us
will
have
to
stand
guard
over
him
while
the
other
one
hunts
up
the
sheep
shall
i
neither
of
us
need
do
that
said
the
master
lad
the
collie
started
eagerly
forward
and
schwartz
started
still
more
eagerly
backward
watch
him
commanded
the
master
him
it
was
an
order
lad
had
learned
to
follow
in
the
many
times
when
the
mistress
and
the
master
left
him
to
guard
the
car
or
to
do
sentry
duty
over
some
other
article
of
value
he
understood
he
would
have
preferred
to
deal
with
this
enemy
according
to
his
own
lights
but
the
master
had
spoken
so
standing
at
view
the
collie
looked
longingly
at
schwartz
throat
keep
perfectly
still
the
master
warned
the
prisoner
and
perhaps
he
wo
go
for
you
move
and
he
most
surely
will
him
laddie
maclay
and
the
master
left
the
captive
and
his
guard
and
set
forth
on
a
tour
of
the
knoll
it
was
a
desolate
spot
far
back
in
the
swamp
and
more
than
a
mile
from
any
road
a
place
visited
not
three
times
a
year
except
in
the
shooting
season
in
less
than
a
the
plaintive
of
a
sheep
guided
the
searchers
to
the
left
of
the
knoll
where
stood
a
thick
copse
around
this
they
circled
until
they
reached
a
narrow
opening
where
the
several
feet
above
ground
were
flecked
with
hanks
of
wool
squirming
through
the
aperture
in
single
file
the
investigators
found
what
they
sought
in
the
copse
center
was
a
small
clearing
in
this
was
a
rudely
wattled
pen
some
nine
feet
square
and
in
the
pen
were
bunched
six
sheep
an
occasional
scared
bleat
from
deeper
in
the
copse
told
the
whereabouts
of
the
sheep
schwartz
had
taken
from
the
barnyard
that
night
and
which
he
had
dropped
at
lad
onslaught
before
he
could
put
it
in
the
pen
on
the
ground
just
outside
the
enclosure
lay
the
smashed
lantern
sheep
on
the
hoof
are
worth
per
at
the
paterson
market
mused
the
master
aloud
as
maclay
blinked
owlishly
at
the
treasure
trove
there
are
worth
of
sheep
in
that
pen
and
there
would
have
been
three
more
of
them
before
morning
if
we
had
butted
in
on
herr
schwartz
overtime
labors
to
get
three
sheep
at
night
it
was
well
worth
his
while
to
switch
suspicion
to
lad
by
killing
a
fourth
sheep
every
time
and
mangling
its
throat
with
a
only
he
mangled
it
too
efficiently
there
was
too
much
about
the
mangling
it
was
ragged
enough
that
what
first
gave
me
my
idea
that
and
the
way
the
missing
sheep
always
vanished
into
more
or
less
thin
air
you
see
he
probably
but
sputtered
maclay
why
four
each
night
why
you
saw
how
long
it
took
him
to
get
one
of
them
here
replied
the
master
he
did
dare
to
start
in
till
the
romaines
were
asleep
and
he
had
to
be
back
in
time
to
catch
lad
at
the
slaughter
before
titus
got
out
of
bed
he
would
dare
hide
them
any
nearer
home
titus
has
spent
most
of
his
time
both
days
in
hunting
for
them
schwartz
was
probably
waiting
to
get
the
pen
nice
and
full
then
he
take
a
day
off
to
visit
his
relatives
and
he
round
up
this
tidy
bunch
and
drive
them
over
to
the
ridgewood
road
through
the
woods
and
so
on
to
the
paterson
market
it
was
a
pretty
little
scheme
all
around
but
urged
maclay
as
they
turned
back
to
where
lad
still
kept
his
avid
vigil
i
still
hold
you
were
taking
big
chances
in
gambling
and
your
dog
life
that
schwartz
would
do
the
same
thing
again
within
hours
he
might
have
waited
a
day
or
two
till
no
contradicted
the
master
that
just
what
he
might
do
you
see
i
was
perfectly
sure
whether
it
was
schwartz
or
romaine
or
both
who
were
mixed
up
in
this
so
i
set
the
trap
at
both
ends
if
it
was
romaine
it
was
worth
to
him
to
have
more
sheep
killed
within
hours
if
it
was
schwartz
well
that
why
i
made
him
try
to
hit
lad
and
why
i
made
him
try
to
kick
me
the
dog
went
for
him
both
times
and
that
was
enough
to
make
schwartz
want
him
killed
for
his
own
safety
as
well
as
for
revenge
so
he
was
certain
to
arrange
another
killing
within
the
hours
if
only
to
force
me
to
shoot
lad
he
could
steal
or
kill
sheep
by
daylight
i
picked
the
only
hours
he
could
do
it
in
if
he
gotten
lad
killed
probably
have
invented
another
dog
to
help
him
swipe
the
rest
of
the
flock

until
romaine
decided
to
do
the
watching
we
it
was
clever
of
you
cordially
admitted
maclay
mighty
clever
old
man
i
it
was
my
wife
who
worked
it
out
you
know
the
master
reminded
him
i
admit
my
own
cleverness
of
course
only
like
a
lot
of
money
it
all
in
my

name
come
on
lad
you
can
guard
herr
schwartz
just
as
well
by
walking
behind

up
the
evening

by
tendering
a
surprise

genial
old
titus
romaine
i
hope
the
flashlights
will
hold
out
long

for

to
get
a
clear
look
at
his

chapter

there
were
but
three
collies
on
the
place
in
those
days
there
was
a
long
shelf
in
the
master
study
whereupon
shimmered
and
glinted
a
rank
of
silver
cups
of
varying
sizes
and
shapes
two
of
the
dogs
had
won
them
all
above
the
shelf
hung
two
huge
in
the
center
of
each
was
the
small
photograph
of
a
collie
beneath
each
likeness
was
a
certified
pedigree
with
the
names
of
champions
surrounding
the
pictures
and
pedigrees
the
whole
remaining
space
in
both
frames
was
filled
with
blue
ribbons
the
very
meanest
bit
of
silk
in
either
was
a
reserve
winners
while
strung
along
the
tops
of
the
frames
from
side
to
side
ran
a
line
of
medals
cups
medals
and
ribbons
alike
had
been
won
by
the
place
two
great
collies
lad
and
bruce
those
were
their
kennel
names
their
official
titles
on
the
registry
list
were
and
needlessly
long
lad
was
growing
old
his
reign
on
the
place
was
drawing
toward
a
benignant
close
his
muzzle
was
almost
and
his
once
graceful
lines
were
beginning
to
show
the
oncoming
heaviness
of
age
no
longer
could
he
hope
to
hold
his
own
in
form
and
carriage
with
younger
collies
at
the
local
where
once
he
had
carried
all
before
him
bruce
sunnybank
goldsmith
was
six
years
lad
junior
he
was
tawny
of
coat
kingly
of
bearing
a
dog
without
a
fault
of
body
or
of
disposition
stately
as
the
that
the
painters
of
old
used
to
love
to
depict
in
their
portraits
of
monarchs
the
place
third
collie
was
lad
son
wolf
but
neither
cup
nor
ribbon
did
wolf
have
to
show
as
an
excuse
for
his
presence
on
earth
nor
would
he
have
won
recognition
in
the
smallest
and
least
exclusive
for
wolf
was
a
collie
only
by
courtesy
his
breeding
was
as
pure
as
was
any
champion
but
he
was
one
of
those
luckless
types
to
be
found
in
nearly
every
litter
a
throwback
to
some
forgotten
ancestor
whose
points
were
all
defective
not
even
the
glorious
pedigree
of
lad
his
father
could
make
wolf
look
like
anything
more
than
he
was
a
dog
without
a
single
physical
trait
that
followed
the
best
collie
standards
in
spite
of
all
this
he
was
beautiful
his
coat
was
almost
as
bright
and
luxuriant
as
any
he
had
in
a
general
way
the
collie
head
and
brush
but
an
expert
at
the
most
casual
glance
would
have
noted
a
shortness
of
nose
and
breadth
of
jaw
and
a
shape
of
ear
and
shoulder
that
told
dead
against
him
the
collie
is
supposed
to
be
descended
direct
from
the
wolf
and
wolf
looked
far
more
like
his
original
ancestors
than
like
a
thoroughbred
collie
from
puppyhood
he
had
been
the
living
image
except
in
color
of
a
and
it
was
from
this
queer
trait
that
he
had
won
his
name
lad
was
the
mistress
dog
bruce
was
the
master
wolf
belonged
to
the
boy
having
been
born
on
the
latter
birthday
for
the
first
six
months
of
his
life
wolf
lived
at
the
place
on
sufferance
nobody
except
the
boy
took
any
special
interest
in
him
he
was
kept
only
because
his
brothers
had
died
in
early
puppyhood
and
because
the
boy
from
the
outset
had
loved
him
at
six
months
it
was
discovered
that
he
was
a
natural
also
that
he
never
barked
except
to
give
an
alarm
a
collie
is
perhaps
the
most
excitable
of
all
large
dogs
the
veriest
trifle
will
set
him
off
into
a
thunderous
paroxysm
of
barking
but
wolf
the
boy
noted
never
barked
without
strong
cause
he
had
the
rare
genius
for
guarding
that
so
few
of
his
breed
possess
for
not
one
dog
in
ten
merits
the
title
of
the
duties
that
should
go
with
that
office
are
far
more
than
the
mere
clamorous
announcement
of
a
stranger
approach
or
even
the
attacking
of
such
a
stranger
the
born
patrols
his
beat
once
in
so
often
during
the
night
at
all
times
he
must
sleep
with
one
ear
and
one
eye
alert
by
day
or
by
night
he
must
discriminate
between
the
visitor
whose
presence
is
permitted
and
the
trespasser
whose
presence
is
not
he
must
know
what
class
of
undesirable
to
scare
off
with
a
growl
and
what
class
needs
stronger
measures
he
must
also
know
to
the
inch
the
boundaries
of
his
own
master
land
few
of
these
things
can
be
taught
all
of
them
must
be
instinctive
wolf
had
been
born
with
them
most
dogs
are
not
his
value
as
a
gave
wolf
a
settled
position
of
his
own
on
the
place
lad
was
growing
old
and
a
little
deaf
he
slept
at
night
under
the
piano
in
the
bruce
was
worth
too
much
money
to
be
left
at
large
in
the
night
time
for
any
clever
to
steal
so
he
slept
in
the
study
rex
a
huge
mongrel
was
tied
up
at
night
at
the
lodge
a
furlong
away
thus
wolf
alone
was
left
on
guard
at
the
house
the
piazza
was
his
from
this
shelter
he
was
wont
to
set
forth
three
or
four
times
a
night
in
all
sorts
of
weather
to
make
his
rounds
the
place
covered
acres
it
ran
from
the
a
furlong
above
the
house
down
to
the
lake
that
bordered
it
on
two
sides
on
the
third
side
was
the
forest
late
at
night
had
a
pleasant
way
of
trying
to
raid
the
lakeside
tramps
now
and
then
strayed
down
the
drive
from
the
main
road
prowlers
crossing
the
woods
sometimes
sought
to
use
the
place
sloping
lawn
as
a
short
cut
to
the
turnpike
below
the
falls
for
each
and
all
of
these
intruders
wolf
had
an
welcome
a
whirl
of
madly
pattering
feet
through
the
dark
a
snarling
growl
far
down
in
the
throat
a
furry
shape
catapulting
into
the
air
and
the
trespasser
had
his
choice
between
a
scurrying
retreat
or
a
double
set
of
white
fangs
in
the
part
of
his
anatomy
the
boy
was
inordinately
proud
of
his
pet
watchdog
prowess
he
was
prouder
yet
of
wolf
almost
incredible
sharpness
of
intelligence
his
quickness
to
learn
his
knowledge
of
word
meaning
his
zest
for
romping
his
perfect
obedience
the
tricks
he
had
taught
himself
without
human
tutelage
in
short
all
the
things
that
were
a
sign
of
the
brain
he
had
inherited
from
lad
but
none
of
these
talents
overcame
the
sad
fact
that
wolf
was
not
a
show
dog
and
that
he
looked
positively
underbred
and
shabby
alongside
of
his
sire
or
of
bruce
which
rankled
at
the
boy
heart
even
while
loyalty
to
his
adored
pet
would
not
let
him
confess
to
himself
or
to
anyone
else
that
wolf
was
not
the
most
flawlessly
perfect
dog
on
earth
for
a
collie
slim
graceful
fierce
affectionate
wolf
was
the
boy
darling
and
he
was
lad
successor
as
official
guardian
of
the
place
but
all
his
youthful
life
thus
far
had
brought
him
nothing
more
than
this
while
lad
and
bruce
had
been
winning
prize
after
prize
at
one
local
dog
show
after
another
within
a
radius
of
thirty
miles
the
boy
was
duly
enthusiastic
over
the
winning
of
each
trophy
but
always
for
days
thereafter
he
was
more
than
usually
attentive
to
wolf
to
make
up
for
his
pet
dearth
of
prizes
once
or
twice
the
boy
had
hinted
in
a
veiled
tentative
way
that
young
wolf
might
perhaps
win
something
too
if
he
were
allowed
to
go
to
a
show
the
master
never
suspecting
what
lay
behind
the
cautious
words
would
always
laugh
in
derision
or
else
he
would
point
in
silence
to
wolf
head
and
then
to
lad
the
boy
knew
enough
about
collies
to
carry
the
subject
no
further
for
even
his
eyes
of
devotion
could
not
fail
to
mark
the
difference
in
aspect
between
his
dog
and
the
two
one
july
morning
both
lad
and
bruce
went
through
an
hour
of
anguish
both
of
them
one
after
the
other
were
plunged
into
a
full
of
warm
water
and
naphtha
and
lux
and
were
scrubbed
right
unmercifully
after
which
they
were
rubbed
and
curried
and
brushed
for
another
hour
until
their
coats
shone
resplendent
all
day
at
intervals
the
brushing
and
combing
were
kept
up
lad
was
indignant
at
such
treatment
and
he
took
no
pains
to
hide
his
indignation
he
knew
perfectly
well
from
the
undue
attention
that
a
dog
show
was
at
hand
but
not
for
a
year
or
more
had
he
himself
been
made
ready
for
one
his
lake
baths
and
his
daily
casual
brushing
at
the
mistress
hands
had
been
in
that
time
his
only
form
of
grooming
he
had
thought
himself
graduated
forever
from
the
nuisance
of
going
to
shows
what
the
idea
of
dolling
up
old
laddie
like
that
asked
the
boy
as
he
came
in
for
luncheon
and
found
the
mistress
busy
with
comb
and
over
the
unhappy
dog
for
the
fourth
of
july
red
cross
dog
show
at
ridgewood
answered
his
mother
looking
up
a
little
flushed
from
her
exertions
but
i
thought
you
and
dad
said
last
year
he
was
too
old
to
show
any
more
ventured
the
boy
this
time
is
different
said
the
mistress
it
a
specialty
show
you
see
and
there
is
a
cup
offered
for
best
dog
of
any
recognized
breed
is
that
fine
we
did
hear
of
the
veteran
cup
till
hooper
telephoned
to
us
about
it
this
morning
so
getting
lad
ready
there
be
any
other
veteran
as
splendid
as
he
is
no
agreed
the
boy
dully
i
suppose
not
he
went
into
the
surreptitiously
helped
himself
to
a
handful
of
and
passed
on
out
to
the
veranda
wolf
was
sprawled
on
the
driveway
lawn
in
the
sun
the
dog
wolflike
brush
began
to
thump
against
the
shaven
grass
then
as
the
boy
stood
on
the
veranda
edge
and
snapped
his
fingers
wolf
got
up
from
his
soft
and
started
toward
him
treading
mincingly
and
with
a
sort
of
swagger
his
slanting
eyes
half
shut
his
mouth
you
know
i
got
sugar
in
my
pocket
as
well
as
if
you
saw
it
said
the
boy
stop
where
you
are
though
the
boy
accompanied
his
order
with
no
gesture
nor
change
of
tone
the
dog
stopped
dead
short
ten
feet
away
sugar
is
bad
for
dogs
went
on
the
boy
it
does
things
to
their
teeth
and
their
digestions
did
anybody
ever
tell
you
that
wolfie
the
young
dog
grin
grew
wider
his
slanting
eyes
closed
to
mere
glittering
slits
he
fidgeted
a
little
his
tail
wagging
fast
but
i
guess
a
dog
got
to
have
kind
of
consolation
purse
when
he
ca
go
to
a
show
resumed
the
boy
catch
as
he
spoke
he
suddenly
drew
a
lump
of
sugar
from
his
pocket
and
with
the
same
motion
tossed
it
in
the
direction
of
wolf
swift
as
was
the
boy
action
wolf
eye
was
still
quicker
springing
high
in
air
the
dog
caught
the
flung
cube
of
sugar
as
it
flew
above
him
and
to
one
side
a
second
and
a
third
lump
were
caught
as
deftly
as
the
first
then
the
boy
took
from
his
pocket
the
fourth
and
last
lump
descending
the
steps
he
put
his
left
hand
across
wolf
eyes
with
his
right
he
flipped
the
lump
of
sugar
into
a
clump
of
shrubbery
find
it
he
commanded
lifting
the
blindfold
from
the
eyes
of
his
pet
wolf
darted
hither
and
thither
stopped
once
or
twice
to
sniff
then
began
to
circle
the
nearer
stretch
of
lawn
nose
to
ground
in
less
than
two
minutes
he
merged
from
the
shrubbery
placidly
crunching
the
between
his
mighty
jaws
and
yet
they
say
you
are
fit
to
be
shown
exclaimed
the
boy
fondling
the
dog
ears
gee
but
i
give
two
years
growth
if
you
could
have
a
cup
you
deserve
one
all
right
if
only
those
judges
had
sense
enough
to
study
a
collie
brain
as
well
as
the
outside
of
his
head
wolf
ran
his
nose
into
the
cupped
palm
and
whined
from
the
tone
underlying
the
words
he
knew
the
boy
was
unhappy
and
he
wanted
to
be
of
help
the
boy
went
into
the
house
again
to
find
his
parents
sitting
down
to
lunch
gathering
his
courage
in
both
hands
he
asked
is
there
going
to
be
a
novice
class
for
collies
at
ridgewood
dad
why
yes
said
the
master
i
suppose
so
there
always
is
do
do
they
give
cups
for
the
novice
class
inquired
the
boy
with
studied
carelessness
of
course
they
do
said
the
master
adding
reminiscently
though
the
first
time
we
showed
lad
we
put
him
in
the
novice
class
and
he
won
the
blue
ribbon
there
so
we
had
to
go
into
the
winners
class
afterward
he
got
the
winner
cup
you
remember
so
indirectly
the
novice
class
won
him
a
cup
i
see
said
the
boy
not
at
all
interested
in
this
bit
of
ancient
history
then
speaking
very
fast
he
went
on
well
a
ribbon
better
than
nothing
dad
will
you
do
me
a
favor
will
you
let
me
enter
wolfie
for
the
novice
class
i
pay
the
fee
out
of
my
allowance
will
you
dad
the
master
looked
at
his
son
in
blank
amazement
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
loudly
the
boy
flushed
crimson
and
bit
his
lips
why
dear
hurriedly
interposed
the
mistress
noting
her
discomfiture
you
would
want
wolf
to
go
there
and
be
beaten
by
a
lot
of
dogs
that
have
half
his
brains
or
prettiness
it
would
be
fair
or
kind
to
wolf
he
so
clever
he
know
in
a
moment
what
was
happening
he
know
he
was
beaten
nearly
all
dogs
do
no
it
would
be
fair
to
him
there
a
class
among
the
specials
hopper
says
put
in
the
master
jocosely
you
might
wolf
a
mutt
flashed
the
boy
hotly
he
no
more
of
a
mutt
than
bruce
or
lad
or
grey
mist
or
southport
sample
or
any
of
the
best
ones
he
has
as
good
blood
as
all
of
them
lad
his
father
and
squire
of
tytton
was
his
grandfather
and
wishaw
clinker
was
his
i
sorry
son
interposed
the
master
catching
his
wife
eye
and
dropping
his
tone
of
banter
i
apologize
to
you
and
wolf
he
not
a
there
no
better
blood
in
colliedom
than
his
on
both
sides
but
mother
is
right
you
only
be
putting
him
up
to
be
beaten
and
you
would
like
that
he
has
a
single
point
that
hopelessly
bad
from
a
judge
view
we
never
taken
a
loser
to
a
show
from
the
place
you
do
want
us
to
begin
now
do
you
he
has
more
brains
that
any
dog
alive
except
lad
declared
the
boy
sullenly
that
ought
to
count
it
ought
to
agreed
the
mistress
soothingly
and
i
wish
it
did
if
it
did
i
know
he
win
it
makes
me
sick
to
see
a
bushel
of
cups
go
to
dogs
that
do
know
enough
to
eat
their
own
dinners
snorted
the
boy
i
not
talking
about
lad
and
bruce
but
the
thoroughbreds
that
are
brought
up
in
kennels
and
that
have
all
their
sense
sacrificed
for
points
why
wolf
the
cleverest
best
and
he
never
even
have
one
cup
to
show
for
it
he
he
choked
and
began
to
eat
at
top
speed
the
master
and
the
mistress
looked
at
each
other
and
said
nothing
they
understood
their
chagrin
as
only
a
could
understand
it
the
mistress
reached
out
and
patted
the
boy
gently
on
the
shoulder
next
morning
directly
after
early
breakfast
lad
and
bruce
were
put
into
the
tonneau
of
the
car
the
mistress
and
the
master
and
the
boy
climbed
in
and
the
journey
to
ridgewood
began
wolf
left
to
guard
the
place
watched
the
departing
until
the
car
turned
out
of
the
gate
a
furlong
above
then
with
a
sigh
he
curled
up
on
the
porch
mat
his
nose
between
his
snowy
little
paws
and
prepared
for
a
day
of
loneliness
the
red
cross
dog
show
that
fourth
of
july
was
a
triumph
for
the
place
bruce
won
ribbon
after
ribbon
in
the
collie
division
easily
taking
winners
at
the
last
and
thus
adding
another
gorgeous
silver
cup
to
his
collection
then
the
supreme
event
of
the
day
best
dog
in
the
show
was
called
and
the
winners
of
each
breed
were
led
into
the
ring
the
judges
scanned
and
handled
the
group
of
sixteen
for
barely
five
minutes
before
awarding
to
bruce
the
rosette
and
the
best
dog
cup
the
crowd
around
the
ring
railing
applauded
loudly
but
they
applauded
still
more
loudly
a
little
later
when
after
a
brief
survey
of
nine
aged
thoroughbreds
the
judge
pointed
to
lad
who
was
standing
like
a
mahogany
statue
at
one
end
of
the
ring
these
nine
dogs
of
various
breeds
had
all
been
famed
in
their
time
and
above
all
the
rest
lad
was
adjudged
worthy
of
the
veteran
cup
there
was
a
haze
of
happy
tears
in
the
mistress
eyes
as
she
led
him
from
the
ring
it
seemed
a
beautiful
climax
for
his
grand
old
life
she
wiped
her
eyes
unashamed
whispering
praise
the
while
to
her
stately
dog
why
do
you
trundle
your
car
into
the
ring
one
disgruntled
exhibitor
demanded
of
the
mistress
maybe
you
win
a
cup
with
too
you
seem
to
have
gotten
one
for
everything
else
you
brought
along
it
was
a
celebration
evening
for
the
two
prize
dogs
when
they
got
home
but
everybody
was
tired
from
the
day
events
and
by
ten
the
house
was
dark
wolf
on
his
veranda
mat
alone
of
all
the
place
denizens
was
awake
vaguely
wolf
knew
the
other
dogs
had
done
some
praiseworthy
thing
he
would
have
known
it
if
for
no
other
reason
from
the
remorseful
hug
the
boy
had
given
him
before
going
to
bed
well
some
must
win
honors
and
petting
and
the
right
to
sleep
indoors
while
others
must
plod
along
at
the
only
work
they
were
fit
for
and
must
sleep
out
in
thunderstorm
or
clear
in
heat
or
freezing
cold
that
was
life
being
only
a
dog
wolf
was
too
wise
to
complain
of
life
he
took
things
as
he
found
them
making
the
very
best
of
his
share
he
snoozed
now
in
the
warm
darkness
two
hours
later
he
got
up
stretched
himself
lazily
fore
and
aft
and
trotted
forth
for
the
night
first
patrol
of
the
grounds
a
few
minutes
afterward
he
was
skirting
the
lake
edge
at
the
foot
of
the
lawn
a
hundred
yards
below
the
house
the
night
was
pitch
dark
except
for
pulses
of
now
and
then
far
to
westward
half
a
mile
out
on
the
lake
two
men
in
an
anchored
scow
were
a
small
skiff
was
slipping
along
very
slowly
not
fifty
feet
off
shore
wolf
did
not
give
the
skiff
a
second
glance
boats
were
no
novelty
to
him
nor
did
they
interest
him
in
the
least
except
when
they
showed
signs
of
running
ashore
somewhere
along
his
beat
this
skiff
was
not
headed
for
land
but
was
paralleling
the
shore
it
crept
along
at
a
and
in
dead
silence
a
man
its
only
occupant
sat
at
the
oars
scarcely
moving
them
as
he
kept
his
boat
in
motion
a
dog
is
ridiculously
more
so
than
almost
any
other
beast
keen
hearing
and
keener
scent
are
its
chief
guides
at
three
hundred
yards
distance
it
can
not
by
eye
recognize
its
master
nor
tell
him
from
a
stranger
but
at
close
quarters
even
in
the
darkest
night
a
dog
vision
is
far
more
piercing
and
accurate
than
under
like
conditions
wolf
thus
saw
the
skiff
and
its
occupant
while
he
himself
was
still
invisible
the
boat
was
no
concern
of
his
so
he
trotted
on
to
the
far
end
of
the
place
where
the
forest
joined
the
orchard
on
his
return
tour
of
the
lake
edge
he
saw
the
skiff
again
it
had
shifted
its
direction
and
was
now
barely
ten
feet
off
shore
so
near
to
the
bank
that
one
of
the
oars
occasionally
grated
on
the
pebbly
bottom
the
oarsman
was
looking
intently
toward
the
house
wolf
paused
uncertain
the
average
watchdog
his
attention
thus
attracted
would
have
barked
but
wolf
knew
the
lake
was
public
property
boats
were
often
rowed
as
close
to
shore
as
this
without
intent
to
trespass
it
was
not
the
skiff
that
caught
wolf
attention
as
he
paused
there
on
the
brink
it
was
the
man
furtive
scrutiny
of
the
house
a
pale
flare
of
turned
the
world
momentarily
from
jet
black
to
a
dim
the
boatman
saw
wolf
standing
alert
and
suspicious
among
the
lakeside
grasses
not
ten
feet
away
he
started
slightly
and
a
soft
throaty
growl
from
the
dog
answered
him
the
man
seemed
to
take
the
growl
as
a
challenge
and
to
accept
it
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
drew
something
out
when
the
next
faint
glow
of
lightning
illumined
the
shore
the
man
lifted
the
thing
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
and
hurled
it
at
wolf
with
all
the
furtive
swiftness
bred
in
his
the
dog
shrank
to
one
side
readily
dodging
the
missile
which
struck
the
lawn
just
behind
him
teeth
bared
in
a
ferocious
snarl
wolf
dashed
forward
through
the
shallow
water
toward
the
skiff
but
the
man
apparently
had
had
enough
of
the
business
he
rowed
off
with
long
strokes
into
deep
water
and
once
there
he
kept
on
rowing
until
distance
and
darkness
hid
him
wolf
stood
chest
deep
in
water
listening
to
the
until
they
died
away
he
was
not
fool
enough
to
swim
in
pursuit
well
knowing
that
a
swimming
dog
is
worse
than
helpless
against
a
boatman
moreover
the
intruder
had
been
scared
away
that
was
all
which
concerned
wolf
he
turned
back
to
shore
his
vigil
was
ended
for
another
few
hours
it
was
time
to
take
up
his
nap
where
he
had
left
off
before
he
had
taken
two
steps
his
sensitive
nostrils
were
full
of
the
scent
of
raw
meat
there
on
the
lawn
ahead
of
him
lay
a
chunk
of
beef
as
big
as
a
fist
this
then
was
what
the
boatman
had
thrown
at
him
wolf
pricked
up
his
ears
in
appreciation
and
his
brush
began
to
vibrate
trespassers
had
once
or
twice
tried
to
stone
him
but
this
was
the
first
time
any
of
them
had
pelted
him
with
delicious
raw
beef
evidently
lad
and
bruce
were
not
the
only
collies
on
the
place
to
receive
prizes
that
day
wolf
stooped
over
the
meat
sniffed
at
it
then
caught
it
up
between
his
jaws
now
a
dog
is
the
easiest
animal
alive
to
poison
just
as
a
cat
is
the
hardest
for
a
dog
will
usually
bolt
a
mouthful
of
poisoned
meat
without
pausing
to
chew
or
otherwise
investigate
it
a
cat
on
the
contrary
smells
and
tastes
everything
first
and
chews
it
scientifically
before
swallowing
it
the
slightest
unfamiliar
scent
or
flavor
warns
her
to
sheer
off
from
the
feast
so
the
average
dog
would
have
gulped
this
toothsome
windfall
in
a
single
swallow
but
wolf
was
not
the
average
dog
no
collie
is
and
wolf
was
still
more
like
his
eccentric
forefathers
of
the
wilderness
than
are
most
collies
he
lacked
the
reasoning
powers
to
make
him
suspicious
of
this
rich
gift
from
a
stranger
but
a
queer
personal
trait
now
served
him
just
as
well
wolf
was
an
epicure
he
always
took
three
times
as
long
to
empty
his
dinner
dish
as
did
the
other
dogs
for
instead
of
gobbling
his
meal
as
they
did
he
was
wont
to
nibble
affectedly
at
each
morsel
gnawing
it
slowly
into
nothingness
and
all
the
time
showing
a
fussily
dainty
relish
of
it
that
used
to
delight
the
boy
and
send
guests
into
peals
of
laughter
this
odd
little
trait
that
had
caused
so
much
ridicule
now
saved
wolf
life
he
carried
the
lump
of
beef
gingerly
up
to
the
veranda
laid
it
down
on
his
mat
and
prepared
to
revel
in
his
chance
banquet
after
his
own
deliberate
fashion
holding
the
beef
between
his
forepaws
he
proceeded
to
devour
it
in
mincing
little
about
a
quarter
of
the
meat
had
disappeared
when
wolf
became
aware
that
his
tongue
smarted
and
that
his
throat
was
sore
also
that
the
interior
of
the
had
a
ranky
pungent
odor
very
different
from
the
heavenly
fragrance
of
its
outside
and
not
at
all
appetizing
he
looked
down
at
the
chunk
rolled
it
over
with
his
nose
surveyed
it
again
then
got
up
and
moved
away
from
it
in
angry
disgust
presently
he
forgot
his
disappointment
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
very
very
his
tongue
and
throat
no
longer
burned
but
his
body
and
brain
seemed
full
of
hot
lead
that
weighed
a
ton
he
felt
stupid
and
too
weak
to
stir
a
great
drowsiness
gripped
him
with
a
grunt
of
discomfort
and
utter
fatigue
he
slumped
down
on
the
veranda
floor
to
sleep
off
his
sick
lassitude
after
that
for
a
time
nothing
mattered
for
perhaps
an
hour
wolf
lay
sprawling
there
dead
to
his
duty
and
to
everything
else
then
faintly
through
the
fog
of
dullness
that
enwrapped
his
brain
came
a
sound
a
sound
he
had
long
ago
learned
to
listen
for
the
harshly
scraping
noise
of
a
boat
prow
drawn
up
on
the
pebbly
shore
at
the
foot
of
the
lawn
instinct
tore
through
the
poison
vapors
and
roused
the
sick
dog
he
lifted
his
head
it
was
strangely
heavy
and
hard
to
lift
the
sound
was
repeated
as
the
prow
was
pulled
farther
up
on
the
bank
then
came
the
crunch
of
a
human
foot
on
the
waterside
grass
heredity
and
training
and
lifelong
fidelity
took
control
of
the
lethargic
dog
dragging
him
to
his
feet
and
down
the
veranda
steps
through
no
volition
of
his
own
every
motion
tired
him
he
was
dizzy
and
nauseated
he
craved
sleep
but
as
he
was
just
a
thoroughbred
dog
and
not
a
wise
human
he
did
not
stop
to
think
up
good
reasons
why
he
should
shirk
his
duty
because
he
did
not
feel
like
performing
it
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
he
trotted
slowly
heavily
shakily
his
sharp
powers
of
hearing
told
him
the
trespasser
had
left
his
boat
and
had
taken
one
or
two
stealthy
steps
up
the
slope
of
lawn
toward
the
house
and
now
a
puff
of
west
wind
brought
wolf
sense
of
smell
into
action
a
dog
remembers
odors
as
humans
remember
faces
and
the
breeze
bore
to
him
the
scent
of
the
same
man
who
had
flung
ashore
that
bit
of
meat
which
had
caused
all
his
suffering
he
had
caught
the
man
scent
an
hour
earlier
as
he
had
stood
sniffing
at
the
boat
ten
feet
away
from
him
the
same
scent
had
been
on
the
meat
the
man
had
handled
and
now
having
played
such
a
cruel
trick
on
him
the
joker
was
actually
daring
to
intrude
on
the
place
a
gust
of
resentful
rage
pierced
the
dullness
of
wolf
brain
and
sent
a
thrill
of
fierce
energy
through
him
for
the
moment
this
carried
him
out
of
his
sick
self
and
brought
back
all
his
former
zest
as
a
down
the
hill
like
a
furry
whirlwind
flew
wolf
every
tooth
bared
his
back
from
neck
to
tail
now
he
was
well
within
sight
of
the
intruder
he
saw
the
man
pausing
to
adjust
something
to
one
of
his
hands
then
before
this
could
be
accomplished
wolf
saw
him
pause
and
stare
through
the
darkness
as
the
wild
onrush
of
the
dog
feet
struck
upon
his
hearing
another
instant
and
wolf
was
near
enough
to
spring
out
of
the
blackness
he
launched
himself
straight
for
the
trespasser
face
the
man
saw
the
dim
shape
hurtling
through
the
air
toward
him
he
dropped
what
he
was
carrying
and
flung
up
both
hands
to
guard
his
neck
at
that
he
was
none
too
soon
for
just
as
the
thief
palm
reached
his
own
throat
wolf
teeth
met
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
hand
silent
in
agony
the
man
beat
at
the
dog
with
his
free
hand
but
an
attacking
collie
is
hard
to
locate
in
the
darkness
a
bulldog
will
secure
a
grip
and
will
hang
on
a
collie
is
everywhere
at
once
wolf
snapping
jaws
had
already
deserted
the
robber
mangled
hand
and
slashed
the
man
left
shoulder
to
the
bone
then
the
dog
made
another
furious
lunge
for
the
face
down
crashed
the
man
losing
his
balance
under
the
heavy
impact
wolf
atop
of
him
to
guard
his
throat
the
man
rolled
over
on
his
face
kicking
madly
at
the
dog
and
reaching
back
for
his
own
half
in
the
water
and
half
on
the
bank
the
two
rolled
and
thrashed
and
struggled
the
man
panting
and
wheezing
in
mortal
terror
the
dog
growling
in
a
hideous
snarling
fashion
as
might
a
wild
animal
the
thief
torn
left
hand
found
a
grip
on
wolf
throat
he
shoved
the
fiercely
writhing
dog
backward
jammed
a
pistol
against
wolf
head
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
dog
relaxed
his
grip
and
tumbled
in
a
huddled
heap
on
the
brink
the
man
staggered
gasping
to
his
feet
bleeding
disheveled
his
clothes
torn
and
the
echoes
of
the
shot
were
still
reverberating
among
the
lakeside
hills
several
of
the
house
dark
windows
leaped
into
sudden
light
then
more
windows
in
another
room
and
in
another
the
thief
swore
roundly
his
night
work
was
ruined
he
bent
to
his
skiff
and
shoved
it
into
the
water
then
he
turned
to
grope
for
what
he
had
dropped
on
the
lawn
when
wolf
unexpected
attack
had
interfered
with
his
plans
as
he
did
so
something
seized
him
by
the
ankle
in
panic
terror
the
man
screamed
aloud
and
jumped
into
the
water
then
peering
back
he
saw
what
had
happened
wolf
sprawling
and
unable
to
stand
had
reached
forward
from
where
he
lay
and
had
driven
his
teeth
for
the
last
time
into
his
foe
the
thief
raised
his
pistol
again
and
fired
at
the
prostrate
dog
then
he
clambered
into
his
boat
and
rowed
off
with
frantic
speed
just
as
a
salvo
of
barks
told
that
lad
and
bruce
had
been
released
from
the
house
they
came
charging
down
the
lawn
the
master
at
their
heels
but
already
the
quick
were
growing
distant
and
the
gloom
had
blotted
out
any
chance
of
seeing
or
following
the
boat
wolf
lay
on
his
side
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
water
he
could
not
rise
as
was
his
custom
to
meet
the
boy
who
came
running
up
close
behind
the
master
and
valorously
grasping
a
target
rifle
but
the
dog
wagged
his
tail
in
feeble
greeting
then
he
looked
out
over
the
black
lake
and
snarled
the
bullet
had
grazed
wolf
scalp
and
then
had
passed

that
a

good
nursing
would
not
set
right
the
marks

the
poisoned
meat
on

their

tale
so
did
the
neat

tools
and
a
rubber
glove
found
near
the
foot
of
the
lawn
and
then
the
telephone
was
put
to
work
at
dawn
a
man
in
torn
and
muddy
clothes
called
at
the
office
of
a
doctor
three
miles
away
to
be
treated
for
a
received
he
said
from
a
pack
of
stray
curs
he
had
met
on
the
turnpike
by
the
time
his
wounds
were
dressed
the
sheriff
and
two
deputies
had
arrived
to
take
him
in
charge
in
his
pockets
were
a
revolver
with
two
cartridges
fired
and
the
mate
of
the
rubber
glove
he
had
left
on
the
place
lawn
you
you
would
let
wolfie
go
to
any
show
and
win
a
cup
for
himself
the
boy
as
the
master
worked
over
the
injured
dog
wound
but
he
saved
you
from
losing
all
the
cups
the
other
dogs
ever
won
three
days
later
the
master
came
home
from
a
trip
to
the
city
he
went
directly
to
the
boy
room
there
on
a
rug
lounged
the
convalescent
wolf
the
boy
sitting
beside
him
stroking
the
dog
bandaged
head
wolf
said
the
master
solemnly
i
been
talking
about
you
to
some
people
i
know
and
we
all
agree
agree
asked
the
boy
looking
up
in
mild
curiosity
the
master
cleared
his
throat
and
continued
we
agree
that
the
in
my
study
has
enough
cups
on
it
so
i
decided
to
add
still
another
to
the
collection
want
to
see
it
son
from
behind
his
back
the
master
produced
a
gleaming
silver
cup
one
of
the
largest
and
most
ornate
the
boy
had
ever
seen
larger
even
than
bruce
best
dog
cup
the
boy
took
it
from
his
father
outstretched
hand
who
won
this
he
asked
and
what
for
did
we
get
all
the
cups
that
were
coming
to
us
at
the
shows
is
it
the
boy
voice
trailed
away
into
a
gurgle
of
bewildered
rapture
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
lettering
on
the
big
cup
and
now
his
arm
around
wolf
he
read
the
inscription
aloud
stammering
with
delight
as
he
blurted
out
the
words

chapter
xii
in
the
day
of
battle
now
this
is
the
true
tale
of
lad
last
great
adventure
for
more
years
than
he
could
remember
lad
had
been
king
he
had
ruled
at
the
place
from
to
from
highway
to
lake
he
had
had
as
subjects
many
a
thoroughbred
collie
and
many
a
lesser
animal
and
bird
among
the
little
folk
of
the
place
his
rule
of
them
all
had
been
lofty
and
beneficent
the
other
dogs
at
the
place
recognized
lad
rulership
recognized
it
without
demur
it
would
no
more
have
occurred
to
any
of
them
for
example
to
pass
in
or
out
through
a
doorway
ahead
of
lad
than
it
would
occur
to
a
courtier
to
shoulder
his
way
into
the
ahead
of
his
sovereign
nor
would
one
of
them
intrude
on
the
cave
under
the
piano
which
for
more
than
a
decade
had
been
lad
favorite
great
was
lad
and
now
he
was
old
very
old
he
was
thirteen
which
is
equivalent
to
the
human
age
of
seventy
his
long
clean
lines
had
become
blurred
with
flesh
he
was
undeniably
stout
when
he
ran
fast
he
rolled
slightly
in
his
stride
nor
could
he
run
as
rapidly
or
as
long
as
of
yore
while
he
was
not
wheezy
or
asthmatic
yet
a
brisk
walk
would
make
him
strangely
anxious
for
an
hour
rest
he
would
not
confess
even
to
himself
that
age
was
beginning
to
hamper
him
so
cruelly
and
he
sought
to
do
all
the
things
he
had
once
done
if
the
mistress
or
the
master
were
looking
but
when
he
was
alone
or
with
the
other
dogs
he
spared
himself
every
needless
step
and
he
slept
a
great
deal
withal
lad
was
a
hale
old
age
his
spirit
and
his
almost
uncanny
intelligence
had
not
faltered
save
for
the
silvered
muzzle
first
outward
sign
of
age
in
a
dog
his
face
and
head
were
as
classically
young
as
ever
so
were
the
absurdly
small
his
one
gross
vanity
on
which
he
spent
hours
of
care
each
day
to
keep
them
clean
and
snowy
he
would
still
dash
out
of
the
house
as
of
old
with
the
wild
trumpeting
bark
which
he
reserved
as
greeting
to
his
two
deities
alone
when
the
mistress
or
the
master
returned
home
after
an
absence
he
would
still
frisk
excitedly
around
either
of
them
at
hint
of
a
romp
but
the
exertion
an
exertion
and
despite
lad
valiant
efforts
at
youthfulness
everyone
could
see
it
was
no
longer
did
he
lead
the
other
dogs
in
their
headlong
rushes
through
the
forest
in
quest
of
rabbits
since
he
could
not
now
keep
the
pace
he
let
the
others
go
on
these
excursions
without
him
and
he
contented
himself
with
an
occasional
lone
and
stately
walk
through
the
woods
where
once
he
had
led
the
run
strolling
along
in
leisurely
fashion
with
the
benign
dignity
of
some
plump
and
ruddy
old
squire
inspecting
his
estate
there
had
been
many
dogs
at
the
place
during
the
thirteen
years
of
lad
reign
dogs
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
including
worshiped
collie
mate
the
dainty
lady
but
in
this
later
day
there
were
but
three
dogs
beside
himself
one
of
them
was
wolf
the
only
surviving
son
of
lad
and
lady
a
slender
powerful
young
collie
with
some
of
his
sire
brain
and
much
of
his
mother
appealing
grace
an
ideal
between
lad
and
wolf
there
had
always
been
a
bond
of
warmest
affection
lad
had
trained
this
son
of
his
and
had
taught
him
all
he
knew
he
unbent
from
his
lofty
dignity
with
wolf
as
with
none
of
the
others
the
second
of
the
remaining
dogs
was
bruce
sunnybank
goldsmith
tawny
as
lad
himself
descendant
of
eleven
international
champions
and
winner
of
many
a
ribbon
and
medal
and
cup
bruce
was
and
is
flawless
in
physical
perfection
and
in
obedience
and
intelligence
the
third
was
rex
a
giant
a
freak
a
dog
oddly
out
of
place
among
a
group
of
thoroughbreds
on
his
father
side
rex
was
pure
collie
on
his
mother
pure
that
is
an
accidental
blending
of
two
breeds
which
can
not
blend
he
looked
more
like
a
great
dane
than
anything
else
he
was
full
two
inches
taller
and
ten
pounds
heavier
than
lad
and
had
the
jaws
of
a
killer
there
was
not
an
outlander
dog
for
two
miles
in
either
direction
that
rex
had
not
at
one
time
or
another
met
and
vanquished
the
strain
which
blended
so
ill
with
collie
blood
made
its
possessor
a
terrific
fighter
he
was
swift
as
a
deer
strong
as
a
puma
in
many
ways
he
was
a
lovable
and
affectionate
pet
slavishly
devoted
to
the
master
and
grievously
jealous
of
the
latter
love
for
lad
rex
was
five
years
old
in
his
fullest
prime
and
like
the
rest
he
had
ever
taken
lad
rulership
for
granted
i
have
written
at
perhaps
prosy
length
introducing
these
characters
of
my
the
rest
is
action
march
that
last
year
was
a
month
of
drearily
recurrent
snows
in
the
forests
beyond
the
place
the
snow
lay
light
and
fluffy
at
a
depth
of
sixteen
inches
on
a
snowy
blowy
bitter
cold
sunday
one
of
those
days
nobody
wants
rex
and
wolf
elected
to
go
bruce
was
not
in
the
hunt
sensibly
preferring
to
lie
in
front
of
the
fire
on
so
vile
a
day
rather
than
to
flounder
through
drifts
in
search
of
game
that
was
not
worth
chasing
under
such
conditions
wolf
too
was
monstrous
comfortable
on
the
old
fur
rug
by
the
fire
at
the
mistress
feet
but
rex
who
had
waxed
oddly
restless
of
late
was
bored
by
the
indoor
afternoon
the
mistress
was
reading
the
master
was
asleep
there
seemed
no
chance
that
either
would
go
for
a
walk
or
otherwise
amuse
their
friends
the
winter
forests
were
calling
the
powerful
crossbred
dog
would
find
the
snow
a
scant
obstacle
to
his
hunting
and
the
warmly
quivering
body
of
a
rabbit
was
a
tremendous
lure
rex
got
to
his
feet
slouched
across
the
to
bruce
and
touched
his
nose
the
drowsing
collie
paid
no
heed
next
rex
moved
over
to
where
wolf
lay
the
two
dogs
noses
touched
now
this
is
no
tale
but
a
true
narrative
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
whether
or
not
dogs
have
a
language
of
their
own
personally
i
think
they
have
and
a
very
comprehensive
one
too
but
i
can
not
prove
it
no
however
will
deny
that
two
dogs
communicate
their
wishes
to
each
other
in
some
way
by
or
during
the
swift
contact
of
noses
by
that
touch
wolf
understood
rex
hint
to
join
in
the
foray
wolf
was
not
yet
four
years
old
at
an
age
when
excitement
still
outweighs
lazy
comfort
moreover
he
admired
and
aped
rex
as
much
as
ever
the
school
littlest
boy
models
himself
on
the
class
bully
he
was
up
at
once
and
ready
to
start
a
maid
was
bringing
in
an
armful
of
wood
from
the
veranda
the
two
dogs
slipped
out
through
the
door
as
they
went
wolf
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
lad
who
was
snoozing
under
the
piano
lad
noted
the
careless
invitation
he
also
noted
that
wolf
did
not
hesitate
when
his
father
refused
to
join
the
outing
but
trotted
gayly
off
in
wake
perhaps
this
defection
hurt
lad
abnormally
sensitive
feelings
for
of
old
he
had
always
led
such
perhaps
the
two
departure
merely
woke
in
him
the
memory
of
the
chase
joys
and
stirred
a
longing
for
the
woods
for
a
minute
or
two
the
big
was
quiet
except
for
the
scratch
of
dry
snow
against
the
panes
the
slow
breathing
of
bruce
and
the
turning
of
a
page
in
the
book
the
mistress
was
reading
then
lad
got
up
heavily
and
walked
forth
from
his
he
stretched
himself
and
crossed
to
the
mistress
chair
there
he
sat
down
on
the
rug
very
close
beside
her
and
laid
one
of
his
ridiculously
tiny
white
in
her
lap
still
absorbed
in
her
book
she
put
out
a
hand
and
patted
the
soft
fur
of
his
ruff
and
ears
often
lad
came
to
her
or
to
the
master
for
some
such
caress
and
receiving
it
would
return
to
his
but
he
was
seeking
to
attract
her
notice
for
something
much
more
important
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
jolly
to
go
with
her
for
a
tramp
in
the
snow
and
his
mere
presence
failing
to
convey
the
hint
he
began
to
talk
to
the
mistress
and
the
master
alone
did
lad
condescend
to
talk
and
then
only
in
moments
of
stress
or
appeal
no
one
hearing
him
at
such
a
time
could
doubt
the
dog
was
trying
to
frame
human
speech
his
vocal
efforts
ran
the
gamut
of
the
entire
scale
wordless
but
decidedly
eloquent
this
talking
would
continue
sometimes
for
several
minutes
without
ceasing
its
tones
carried
whatever
emotion
the
old
dog
sought
to
convey
whether
of
joy
of
grief
of
request
or
of
complaint
there
was
merely
playful
entreaty
in
the
speechless
speech
the
mistress
looked
up
what
is
it
laddie
she
asked
what
do
you
want
for
answer
lad
glanced
at
the
door
then
at
the
mistress
then
he
solemnly
went
out
into
the
hall
whence
presently
he
returned
with
one
of
her
fur
gloves
in
his
mouth
no
no
she
laughed
not
lad
not
in
this
storm
we
take
a
good
long
walk
the
dog
sighed
and
returned
sadly
to
his
lair
beneath
the
piano
but
the
vision
of
the
forests
was
evidently
hard
to
erase
from
his
mind
and
a
little
later
when
the
front
door
was
open
again
by
one
of
the
servants
he
stalked
out
the
snow
was
driving
hard
and
there
was
a
sting
in
it
the
thermometer
was
little
above
zero
but
the
snow
had
been
a
familiar
bedfellow
for
centuries
to
lad
scottish
forefathers
and
the
cold
was
harmless
against
the
woven
thickness
of
his
tawny
coat
picking
his
way
in
stately
fashion
along
the
track
of
the
driveway
he
strolled
toward
the
woods
to
humans
there
was
nothing
in
the
outdoor
day
but
snow
and
chill
and
bluster
and
bitter
loneliness
to
the
trained
eye
and
the
miraculous
of
a
collie
it
contained
a
million
things
of
dramatic
interest
here
a
rabbit
had
crossed
the
trail
not
with
leisurely
bounds
or
mincing
hops
but
stomach
to
earth
in
flight
for
very
life
here
close
at
the
terrified
bunny
heels
had
darted
a
red
fox
yonder
where
the
piling
snow
covered
a
swirl
of
tracks
the
chase
had
ended
the
little
ridge
of
furrow
to
the
right
held
a
basketful
of
cowering
quail
who
heard
lad
slow
step
and
did
not
reckon
on
his
flawless
gift
of
smell
on
the
hemlock
tree
just
ahead
a
hawk
had
lately
torn
a
asunder
a
fluff
of
gray
feathers
still
stuck
to
a
bough
and
the
scent
of
blood
had
not
been
blown
out
of
the
air
underneath
a
was
plowing
its
way
into
the
frozen
earth
its
tiny
wholly
audible
to
the
ears
of
the
dog
above
it
here
through
the
stark
and
drifted
undergrowth
rex
and
wolf
had
recently
swept
along
in
pursuit
of
a
rabbit
even
a
human
eye
could
not
have
missed
their
tracks
but
lad
knew
whose
track
was
whose
and
which
dog
had
been
in
the
lead
yes
to
humans
the
forest
would
have
seemed
a
deserted
white
waste
lad
knew
it
was
with
the
little
people
of
the
woodland
and
that
all
day
and
all
night
the
seemingly
empty
and
placid
groves
were
a
blend
of
battlefield
slaughterhouse
and
restaurant
here
as
much
as
in
the
cities
or
in
the
trenches
abode
strenuous
life
violent
death
struggle
greed
and
terror
a
partridge
rocketed
upward
through
a
clump
of
evergreen
while
a
weasel
jaws
glared
after
it
baffled
a
shaggy
owl
crouched
at
a
hole
and
blinked
sulkily
about
in
search
of
prey
and
in
hope
of
dusk
a
crow
its
black
feet
red
with
a
slain
blood
flapped
clumsily
overhead
a
poet
would
have
vowed
that
the
still
and
wilderness
was
a
shrine
sacred
to
solitude
and
severe
peace
lad
could
have
told
him
better
nature
beneath
the
surface
is
never
solitary
and
never
at
peace
when
a
dog
is
very
old
and
very
heavy
and
a
little
unwieldy
it
is
hard
to
walk
through
snow
even
if
one
moves
slowly
and
sedately
hence
lad
was
well
pleased
to
come
upon
a
narrow
woodland
track
made
by
a
laborer
who
had
passed
and
repassed
through
that
same
strip
of
forest
during
the
last
few
hours
to
follow
in
that
trampled
rut
made
walking
much
easier
it
was
a
rut
barely
wide
enough
for
one
wayfarer
more
and
more
like
an
elderly
squire
patrolling
his
acres
lad
rambled
along
and
presently
his
ears
and
his
nose
told
him
that
his
two
loving
friends
rex
and
wolf
were
coming
toward
him
on
their
way
his
plumy
tail
wagged
expectantly
he
was
growing
a
bit
lonely
on
this
sunday
afternoon
walk
of
his
and
a
little
tired
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
have
company
especially
wolf
rex
and
wolf
had
fared
ill
on
their
hunt
they
had
put
up
two
rabbits
one
had
doubled
and
completely
escaped
them
and
in
the
chase
rex
had
cut
his
foot
nastily
on
a
strip
of
unseen
barbed
wire
the
sandlike
snow
had
gotten
into
the
jagged
cut
in
a
most
irritating
way
the
second
rabbit
had
dived
under
a
log
rex
had
thrust
his
head
fiercely
through
a
snowbank
in
quest
of
the
vanished
prey
and
a
long
hidden
there
had
plunged
its
needle
point
deep
into
the
inside
of
his
left
nostril
the
inner
nostril
is
a
the
most
agonizingly
sensitive
part
of
a
dog
body
and
the
pain
wrung
a
yell
of
rage
and
hurt
from
the
big
dog
with
a
nostril
and
a
foot
both
hurt
there
was
no
more
fun
in
hunting
and
angry
cross
savagely
in
pain
rex
loped
homeward
wolf
pattering
along
behind
him
like
lad
they
came
upon
the
trampled
path
and
took
advantage
of
the
easier
going
thus
it
was
at
a
turn
in
the
track
that
they
came
face
to
face
with
lad
wolf
had
already
smelled
him
and
his
brush
began
to
quiver
in
welcome
rex
his
nose
in
anguish
could
smell
nothing
not
until
that
turn
did
he
know
of
lad
presence
he
halted
sulky
and
the
queer
restlessness
the
savagery
that
had
obsessed
him
of
late
had
been
brought
to
a
head
by
his
hurts
he
was
not
himself
his
mind
was
sick
there
was
not
room
for
two
large
dogs
to
pass
each
other
in
that
narrow
trail
one
or
the
other
must
flounder
out
into
the
deep
snow
to
the
side
ordinarily
there
would
be
no
question
about
any
other
dog
on
the
place
turning
out
for
lad
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
course
and
so
lad
expected
it
to
be
onward
he
moved
at
that
same
dignified
walk
until
he
was
not
a
yard
away
from
rex
the
latter
his
brain
fevered
and
his
hurts
torturing
him
suddenly
flamed
into
rebellion
even
as
a
younger
buck
sooner
or
later
assails
for
mastery
the
leader
of
the
herd
so
the
rex
went
back
all
at
once
to
primal
instincts
a
maniac
rage
mastered
him
the
rage
of
the
angry
underling
the
primitive
lust
for
mastery
with
not
so
much
as
a
growl
or
warning
he
launched
himself
upon
lad
straight
at
the
tired
old
dog
throat
he
flew
lad
all
unprepared
for
such
mutiny
was
caught
clean
off
his
guard
he
had
not
even
time
enough
to
lower
his
head
to
protect
his
throat
or
to
rear
and
meet
his
erstwhile
subject
attack
halfway
at
one
moment
he
had
been
plodding
gravely
toward
his
two
supposedly
loyal
friends
the
next
rex
ninety
pounds
of
muscle
had
smitten
him
violently
to
earth
and
rex
fearsome
jaws
capable
of
cracking
a
as
a
man
cracks
a
filbert
had
found
a
in
the
soft
fur
of
his
throat
down
amid
a
flurry
of
snow
crashed
lad
his
snarling
enemy
upon
him
pinning
him
to
the
ground
the
huge
jaws
tearing
and
rending
at
his
ruff
the
silken
ruff
that
the
mistress
daily
combed
with
such
loving
care
to
keep
it
fluffy
and
beautiful
it
was
a
grip
and
a
leverage
that
would
have
made
the
average
opponent
helpless
with
a
dog
it
would
have
meant
the
end
but
the
providence
that
gave
collies
a
mattress
of
fur
to
stave
off
the
cold
in
their
herding
work
amid
the
snowy
moors
has
made
that
fur
thickest
about
the
lower
neck
rex
had
struck
in
crazy
rage
and
had
not
gauged
his
mark
as
truly
as
though
he
had
been
cooler
he
had
missed
the
jugular
and
found
himself
grinding
at
an
enormous
mouthful
of
matted
hair
and
at
very
little
else
and
lad
belonged
to
the
breed
that
is
never
to
be
taken
wholly
by
surprise
and
that
acts
by
the
swiftest
instinct
or
reason
known
to
dogdom
even
as
he
fell
he
instinctively
threw
his
body
sideways
to
avoid
the
full
jar
of
rex
impact
and
gathered
his
feet
under
him
with
a
heave
that
wrenched
his
every
unaccustomed
muscle
lad
shook
off
the
living
weight
and
scrambled
upright
to
prevent
this
rex
threw
his
entire
body
forward
to
reinforce
his
as
a
result
a
double
handful
of
and
a
patch
of
skin
came
away
in
his
jaws
and
lad
was
free
he
was
free
to
turn
tail
and
run
for
his
life
from
the
unequal
combat
and
that
his
would
not
let
him
do
he
was
free
also
to
stand
his
ground
and
fight
there
in
the
snowbound
forest
until
he
should
be
slain
by
his
younger
and
larger
and
stronger
foe
and
this
folly
his
intelligence
would
not
permit
there
was
one
chance
and
only
one
one
compromise
alone
between
sanity
and
honor
and
this
chance
lad
took
he
not
run
he
not
save
his
life
by
fighting
where
he
stood
his
only
hope
was
to
keep
his
face
to
his
enemy
battling
as
best
he
could
and
all
the
time
keep
backing
toward
home
if
he
could
last
until
he
came
within
sight
or
sound
of
the
folk
at
the
house
he
knew
he
would
be
saved
home
was
a
full
away
and
the
snow
was
almost
yet
on
the
instant
he
laid
out
his
plan
of
campaign
and
put
it
into
action
rex
cleared
his
mouth
of
the
impeding
hair
and
flew
at
lad
once
more
before
the
old
dog
had
fairly
gotten
to
his
feet
but
not
before
the
line
of
defense
had
been
thought
out
lad
half
wheeled
dodging
the
snapping
jaws
by
an
inch
and
taking
the
impact
of
the
charge
on
his
left
shoulder
at
the
same
time
burying
his
teeth
in
the
right
side
of
rex
face
at
the
same
time
lad
gave
ground
moving
backward
three
or
four
yards
helped
along
by
the
impetus
of
his
opponent
home
was
a
behind
him
in
an
oblique
line
and
he
could
not
turn
to
gauge
his
direction
yet
he
moved
in
precisely
the
correct
angle
indeed
a
who
witnessed
the
fight
and
the
master
who
went
carefully
over
the
ground
afterward
proved
that
at
no
point
in
the
battle
did
lad
swerve
or
mistake
his
exact
direction
yet
not
once
could
he
have
been
able
to
look
around
to
judge
it
and
his
showed
that
not
once
had
he
turned
his
back
on
the
foe
the
hold
lad
secured
on
rex
cheek
was
good
but
it
was
not
good
enough
at
thirteen
a
dog
biting
teeth
are
worn
short
and
dull
and
his
yellowed
fangs
are
blunted
nor
is
the
jaw
by
any
means
as
powerful
as
once
it
was
rex
writhed
and
pitched
in
the
fierce
grip
and
presently
tore
free
from
it
and
to
the
attack
again
seeking
now
to
lunge
over
the
top
of
lad
lowered
head
to
the
vital
spot
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
where
sharp
teeth
may
pierce
through
to
the
spinal
cord
thrice
rex
lunged
and
thrice
lad
reared
on
his
hind
legs
meeting
the
shock
with
his
deep
shaggy
breast
snapping
and
slashing
at
his
enemy
and
every
time
receding
a
few
steps
between
charges
they
had
left
the
path
now
and
were
plowing
a
course
through
deep
snow
the
snow
was
scant
barrier
to
rex
full
strength
but
it
terribly
impeded
the
steadily
backing
lad
lad
extra
flesh
too
was
a
bad
handicap
his
wind
was
not
at
all
what
it
should
have
been
and
the
unwonted
exertion
began
to
tell
sharply
on
him
under
the
skies
and
the
drive
of
the
snow
the
fight
swirled
and
eddied
the
great
dogs
reared
clashed
tore
battered
against
lost
footing
and
rolled
staggered
up
again
and
renewed
the
onslaught
ever
lad
manoeuvered
his
way
backward
waging
a
desperate
action
in
the
battle
wake
was
an
irregular
but
mathematically
straight
line
of
trampled
and
snow
oh
but
it
was
slow
going
this
retreat
of
lad
through
the
deep
drifts
with
his
mightier
foe
pressing
him
and
rending
at
his
throat
and
shoulders
at
every
backward
step
the
old
dog
wind
was
gone
his
strength
was
going
but
he
fought
on
with
blazing
fury
the
fury
of
a
dying
king
who
not
be
deposed
in
sheer
skill
and
and
generalship
lad
was
wholly
superior
but
these
served
him
ill
in
a
with
dogs
as
with
human
pugilists
mere
science
and
strategy
avail
little
against
superior
size
and
strength
and
youth
again
and
again
lad
found
or
made
an
opening
again
and
again
his
weakening
jaws
secured
the
right
grip
only
to
be
shaken
off
with
more
and
more
ease
by
the
younger
combatant
again
and
again
lad
slashed
as
do
his
wolf
cousins
and
as
does
almost
no
civilized
dog
but
the
collie
but
the
slashes
had
lost
their
lightning
speed
and
prowess
and
the
blunt
rending
fangs
scored
only
superficial
furrows
in
rex
hide
there
was
meager
hope
of
reaching
home
alive
lad
must
have
known
that
his
strength
was
gone
it
was
his
heart
and
his
glorious
ancestry
now
that
were
doing
his
fighting
not
his
fat
and
body
from
lad
mental
vocabulary
the
word
had
ever
been
absent
wherefore
dizzy
gasping
feebler
every
minute
he
battled
fearlessly
on
in
the
dying
day
never
losing
his
sense
of
direction
never
turning
tail
never
dreaming
of
surrender
taking
dire
wounds
inflicting
light
ones
there
are
many
forms
of
two
strange
dogs
meeting
will
fly
at
each
other
because
their
wild
forbears
used
to
do
so
jealous
dogs
will
battle
even
more
fiercely
but
the
deadliest
of
all
canine
conflicts
is
the
this
is
a
struggle
wherein
one
or
both
contestants
have
decided
to
give
no
quarter
where
the
victor
will
fight
on
until
his
antagonist
is
dead
and
will
then
tear
his
body
to
pieces
it
is
a
recognized
form
of
canine
mania
and
it
was
a
that
rex
was
waging
for
he
had
gone
quite
insane
this
is
wholly
different
by
the
way
from
going
mad
down
went
lad
for
perhaps
the
tenth
time
and
once
more
though
now
with
an
effort
that
was
all
but
too
much
for
him
he
writhed
to
his
feet
gaining
three
yards
of
ground
by
the
move
rex
was
upon
him
with
one
leap
the
frothing
and
bloody
jaws
striking
for
his
mangled
throat
lad
reared
to
block
the
attack
then
suddenly
overbalanced
he
crashed
backward
into
the
snowdrift
rex
had
not
reached
him
but
young
wolf
had
wolf
had
watched
the
battle
with
a
growing
excitement
that
at
last
had
broken
all
bounds
the
instinct
which
makes
a
mix
into
a
scrimmage
that
is
no
concern
of
his
had
suddenly
possessed
lad
dearly
loved
son
now
if
this
were
a
fiction
yarn
it
would
be
edifying
to
tell
how
wolf
sprang
to
the
aid
of
his
grand
old
sire
and
how
he
thereby
saved
lad
life
but
the
shameful
truth
is
that
wolf
did
nothing
of
the
sort
rex
was
his
model
the
bully
he
had
so
long
and
so
enthusiastically
imitated
and
now
rex
was
fighting
a
most
entertaining
bout
fighting
it
with
a
maniac
fury
that
infected
his
young
disciple
and
made
him
yearn
to
share
in
the
glory
wherefore
as
lad
reared
to
meet
rex
lunge
wolf
hurled
himself
like
a
furry
whirlwind
upon
the
old
dog
flank
burying
his
white
teeth
in
the
muscles
of
the
lower
leg
the
flank
attack
bowled
lad
completely
over
there
was
no
chance
now
for
such
a
fall
as
would
enable
him
to
spring
up
again
unscathed
he
was
thrown
heavily
upon
his
back
and
both
his
murderers
plunged
at
his
unguarded
throat
and
lower
body
but
a
collie
thrown
is
not
a
collie
beaten
as
perhaps
i
have
said
once
before
for
thirty
seconds
or
more
the
three
thrashed
about
in
the
snow
in
a
growling
snarling
right
unloving
embrace
then
by
some
miracle
lad
was
on
his
feet
again
his
throat
had
a
new
and
deep
wound
perilously
close
to
the
jugular
his
stomach
and
left
side
were
slashed
as
with
but
he
was
up
and
even
in
that
moment
of
dire
stress
with
both
dogs
flinging
themselves
upon
him
afresh
he
gained
another
yard
or
two
in
his
line
of
retreat
he
might
have
gained
still
more
ground
for
his
assailants
leaping
at
the
same
instant
collided
and
impeded
each
other
charge
but
for
the
first
time
the
wise
old
brain
clouded
and
the
went
sick
as
lad
saw
his
own
loved
and
spoiled
son
ranged
against
him
in
the
he
could
not
understand
loyalty
was
as
much
a
part
of
himself
as
were
his
sorrowful
brown
eyes
or
his
tiny
white
and
wolf
amazing
treachery
seemed
to
numb
the
old
warrior
body
and
mind
but
the
second
of
dumfounded
wonder
passed
quickly
too
quickly
for
either
of
the
other
dogs
to
take
advantage
of
it
in
its
place
surged
a
righteous
wrath
that
for
the
instant
brought
back
youth
and
strength
to
the
aged
fighter
with
a
yell
that
echoed
far
through
the
forest
sinister
silence
lad
whizzed
forward
at
the
advancing
rex
wolf
who
was
nearer
struck
for
his
father
throat
missed
and
rolled
in
the
snow
from
the
force
of
his
own
momentum
lad
did
not
heed
him
straight
for
rex
he
leaped
rex
bounding
at
him
was
already
in
midair
the
two
met
and
under
the
berserk
onset
rex
fell
back
into
the
snow
lad
was
upon
him
at
once
the
teeth
found
their
goal
above
the
jugular
deep
and
raggedly
they
drove
impelled
by
the
brief
flash
of
power
that
upbore
their
owner
almost
did
that
grip
end
the
fight
and
leave
rex
gasping
out
his
life
in
the
drift
but
the
access
of
false
strength
faded
rex
roaring
like
a
hurt
tiger
twisted
and
tore
himself
free
lad
realizing
his
own
bolt
was
shot
gave
ground
backing
away
from
two
assailants
instead
of
one
it
was
easier
now
to
retreat
for
wolf
unskilled
in
practical
warfare
at
first
hindered
rex
almost
as
much
as
he
helped
him
again
and
again
getting
in
the
bigger
dog
way
and
marring
a
rush
had
wolf
understood
teamwork
lad
must
have
been
pulled
down
and
slaughtered
in
less
than
a
minute
but
soon
wolf
grasped
the
fact
that
he
could
do
worse
damage
by
keeping
out
of
his
ally
way
and
attacking
from
a
different
quarter
and
thereafter
he
fought
to
more
deadly
purpose
his
favorite
ruse
was
to
dive
for
lad
forelegs
and
attempt
to
break
one
of
them
that
is
a
collie
manoeuver
inherited
direct
from
wolf
namesake
ancestors
several
times
his
jaws
reached
the
slender
white
forelegs
cutting
and
slashing
them
and
throwing
lad
off
his
balance
once
he
found
a
hold
on
the
left
haunch
and
held
it
until
his
victim
shook
loose
by
rolling
lad
defended
himself
from
this
new
foe
as
well
as
he
might
by
dodging
or
by
brushing
him
to
one
side
but
never
once
did
he
attack
wolf
or
so
much
as
snap
at
him
rex
after
the
encounter
was
plentifully
scarred
wolf
had
not
so
much
as
a
scratch
backward
with
difficulty
the
old
dog
fought
his
way
often
borne
down
to
earth
and
always
staggering
up
more
feebly
than
before
but
ever
he
was
warring
with
the
same
fierce
courage
despite
an
ache
and
bewilderment
in
his
honest
heart
at
his
son
treason
the
forest
lay
behind
the
fighters
the
deserted
highroad
was
passed
under
lad
clawing
and
reeling
feet
was
the
dear
ground
of
the
place
the
place
where
for
thirteen
happy
years
he
had
reigned
as
king
where
he
had
benevolently
ruled
his
kind
and
had
given
worshipful
service
to
his
gods
but
the
house
was
still
nearly
a
furlong
off
and
lad
was
dead
his
body
was
one
mass
of
wounds
his
strength
was
turned
to
water
his
breath
was
gone
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
dim
his
brain
was
dizzy
and
refused
its
office
loss
of
blood
had
weakened
him
full
as
much
as
had
the
tremendous
exertion
of
the
battle
yet
uselessly
now
he
continued
to
fight
it
was
a
grotesquely
futile
resistance
the
other
dogs
were
all
over
him
tearing
slashing
gripping
at
will
unhindered
by
his
puny
effort
to
fend
them
off
the
had
come
drunk
with
blood
and
fury
the
assailants
plunged
at
him
for
the
last
time
down
went
lad
helpless
beneath
the
murderous
avalanche
that
overwhelmed
him
and
this
time
his
body
flatly
refused
to
obey
the
grim
command
of
his
will
the
fight
was
over
the
good
fight
of
a
paladin
against
hopeless
odds
the
fire
crackled
cheerily
the
snow
hissed
and
slithered
against
the
glass
a
sheet
of
frost
on
every
pane
shut
out
the
stormy
twilit
world
the
screech
of
the
wind
was
music
to
the
comfortable
the
mistress
drowsed
over
her
book
by
the
fire
bruce
snored
snugly
in
front
of
the
blaze
the
master
had
awakened
from
his
nap
and
was
in
the
adjoining
study
sorting
and
scouring
a
rusted
then
came
a
second
lull
in
the
gale
and
all
at
once
bruce
was
wide
awake
growling
he
ran
to
the
front
door
and
scratched
imperatively
at
the
panel
this
is
not
the
way
a
dog
makes
known
his
desire
to
leave
the
house
and
bruce
was
decidedly
a
dog
the
mistress
thinking
some
guest
might
be
arriving
whose
scent
or
tread
displeased
the
collie
called
to
the
master
to
shut
bruce
in
the
study
lest
he
insult
the
supposed
visitor
by
barking
reluctantly
very
reluctantly
bruce
obeyed
the
order
the
master
shut
the
study
door
behind
him
and
came
into
the
still
carrying
the
knife
as
no
summons
at
bell
or
knocker
followed
bruce
announcement
the
mistress
opened
the
front
door
and
looked
out
the
dusk
was
falling
but
it
was
not
too
dark
for
her
to
have
seen
the
approach
of
anyone
nor
was
it
too
dark
for
the
mistress
to
see
two
dogs
tearing
at
something
that
lay
hidden
from
her
view
in
the
deep
snow
a
hundred
yards
away
she
recognized
rex
and
wolf
at
once
and
amusedly
wondered
with
what
they
were
playing
then
from
the
depth
of
snow
beneath
them
she
saw
a
feeble
head
rear
itself
a
glorious
head
though
torn
and
bleeding
a
head
that
waveringly
lunged
toward
rex
throat
they
they
killing
she
cried
in
stark
unbelieving
horror
forgetful
of
thin
dress
and
thinner
slippers
she
ran
toward
the
trio
halfway
to
the
battlefield
the
master
passed
by
her
running
and
lurching
through
the
snow
at
something
like
record
speed
she
heard
his
shout
and
at
sound
of
it
she
saw
wolf
slink
away
from
the
slaughter
like
a
scared
schoolboy
but
rex
was
too
far
gone
in
to
heed
the
shout
the
master
seized
him
by
the
studded
collar
and
tossed
him
ten
feet
or
more
to
one
side
rex
came
flying
back
to
the
kill
the
master
stood
astride
his
prey
and
in
his
blind
mania
the
sprang
at
the
man
the
master
caught
him
squarely
behind
the
left
and
with
a
grunt
like
the
sound
of
an
exhausted
the
huge
dog
passed
out
of
this
story
and
out
of
life
as
well
there
would
be
ample
time
later
for
the
master
to
mourn
his
enforced
slaying
of
the
pet
dog
that
had
loved
and
served
him
so
long
at
present
he
had
eyes
only
for
the
torn
and
senseless
body
of
lad
lying
huddled
in
the
snow
in
his
arms
he
lifted
lad
and
carried
him
tenderly
into
the
house
there
the
mistress
light
fingers
dressed
his
hideous
injuries
not
less
than
deep
wounds
scored
the
old
body
several
of
these
were
past
the
skill
of
home
treatment
a
grumbling
veterinary
was
summoned
on
the
telephone
and
was
lured
by
pledge
of
a
triple
fee
to
chug
through
ten
miles
of
storm
in
a
balky
car
to
the
rescue
lad
was
lying
with
his
head
in
the
mistress
lap
the
vet
looked
the
unconscious
dog
over
and
then
said
tersely
i
wish
i
stayed
at
home
he
as
good
as
dead
he
a
million
times
better
than
dead
denied
the
master
i
know
lad
you
do
he
got
into
the
habit
of
living
and
he
not
going
to
break
that
habit
not
if
the
best
nursing
and
surgery
in
the
state
can
keep
him
from
doing
it
get
busy
there
nothing
to
keep
me
here
objected
the
vet
he
there
everything
to
keep
you
here
gently
contradicted
the
master
you
stay
here
till
lad
out
of
danger
if
i
have
to
steal
your
trousers
and
your
car
you
going
to
cure
him
and
if
you
do
you
can
write
your
bill
on
a
liberty
bond
two
hours
later
lad
opened
his
eyes
he
was
swathed
in
smelly
bandages
and
he
was
soaked
in
liniments
patches
of
hair
had
been
shaved
away
from
his
worst
wounds
digitalis
was
reinforcing
his
faint
he
looked
up
at
the
mistress
with
his
only
available
eye
by
a
herculean
struggle
he
wagged
his
tail
just
once
and
he
essayed
the
trumpeting
bark
wherewith
he
always
welcomed
her
return
after
an
absence
the
bark
was
a
total
failure
after
which
lad
tried
to
tell
the
mistress
the
story
of
the
battle
very
weakly
but
very
persistently
he
talked
his
tones
dropped
now
and
then
to
the
shadow
of
a
ferocious
growl
as
he
related
his
exploits
and
then
scaled
again
to
a
whimper
he
had
done
a
grand
day
work
had
lad
and
he
wanted
applause
he
had
suffered
much
and
he
was
still
in
racking
pain
and
he
wanted
sympathy
and
petting
presently
he
fell
asleep
it
was
two
weeks
before
lad
could
stand
upright
and
two
more
before
he
could
go
out
of
doors
unhelped
then
on
a
warm
early
spring
morning
the
vet
declared
him
out
of
all
danger
very
thin
was
the
invalid
very
shaky
of
muzzle
and
with
the
air
of
an
old
old
man
whose
body
is
sustained
only
by
a
regal
dignity
but
he
was
slowly
he
marched
from
his
piano
cave
toward
the
open
front
door
wolf
in
black
disgrace
for
the
past
month
chanced
to
be
crossing
the
toward
the
veranda
at
the
same
time
the
two
dogs
reached
the
simultaneously
very
respectfully
almost
cringingly
wolf
stood
aside
for
lad
to
pass
out
his
sire
walked
by
with
never
a
look
but
his
step
was
all
at
once
stronger
and
springier
and
he
held
his
splendid
head
high
for
lad
knew
he
was
still
king
the
end
afterword
the
stories
of
lad
in
various
magazines
found
unexpectedly
kind
welcome
letters
came
to
me
from
soldiers
and
sailors
in
europe
from
hosts
of
children
from
men
and
women
everywhere
few
of
the
bothered
to
praise
the
stories
themselves
but
all
of
them
praised
lad
which
pleased
me
far
better
and
more
than
a
hundred
of
them
wanted
to
know
if
he
were
a
real
dog
and
if
the
tales
of
his
exploits
were
true
perhaps
those
of
you
who
have
followed
lad
adventures
through
these
pages
may
also
be
a
little
interested
to
know
more
about
him
yes
lad
was
a
real
dog
the
greatest
dog
by
far
i
have
known
or
shall
know
and
the
chief
happenings
in
nearly
all
of
my
lad
stories
are
absolutely
true
this
accounts
for
such
measure
of
success
as
the
stories
may
have
won
after
his
day
of
battle
lad
lived
for
more
than
two
years
still
gallant
of
spirit
loyally
mighty
of
heart
uncanny
of
wisdom
still
the
undisputed
king
of
the
place
little
people
then
on
a
warm
september
morning
in
he
stretched
himself
to
sleep
in
the
coolest
and
shadiest
corner
of
the
veranda
and
while
he
slept
his
great
heart
very
quietly
stopped
beating
he
had
no
pain
no
illness
none
of
the
distressing
features
of
extreme
age
he
had
lived
out
a
full
span
of
sixteen
years
years
rich
in
life
and
happiness
and
love
surely
there
was
nothing
in
such
a
death
to
warrant
the
silly
grief
that
was
ours
nor
the
heartsick
gloom
that
overhung
the
place
it
was
wholly
illogical
not
to
say
maudlin
i
admit
that
without
argument
the
of
the
mansion
yard
must
have
known
the
same
miserable
sense
of
loss
i
think
when
he
wrote
stretched
on
the
hearthrug
in
a
deep
content
fond
of
the
fire
as
oh
there
was
something
with
the
old
dog
went
i
had
not
thought
could
die
we
buried
lad
in
a
sunlit
nook
that
had
been
his
favorite
lounging
place
close
to
the
house
he
had
guarded
so
long
and
so
gallantly
with
him
we
buried
his
honorary
red
cross
and
blue
cross
awards
for
money
raised
in
his
name
above
his
head
we
set
a
low
granite
block
with
a
carven
line
or
two
thereon
the
mistress
wanted
the
block
inscribed
the
dearest
dog
i
suggested
the
dog
god
made
but
we
decided
against
both
epitaphs
we
did
not
care
to
risk
making
our
dear
old
friend
memory
ridiculous
by
words
at
which
saner
folk
might
one
day
sneer
so
on
the
granite
is
engraved
lad
thoroughbred
in
body
and
soul
some
people
are
wise
enough
to
know
that
a
dog
has
no
soul
these
will
find
ample
theme
for
mirth
in
our
foolish
inscription
but
no
one
who
knew
lad
will
laugh
at
it
