meno

introduction
this
dialogue
begins
abruptly
with
a
question
of
meno
who
asks
virtue
can
be
taught
socrates
replies
that
he
does
not
as
yet
know
what
virtue
is
and
has
never
known
anyone
who
did
he
can
not
have
met
gorgias
when
he
was
at
athens
yes
socrates
had
met
him
but
he
has
a
bad
memory
and
has
forgotten
what
gorgias
said
will
meno
tell
him
his
own
notion
which
is
probably
not
very
different
from
that
of
gorgias
yes
nothing
easier
there
is
the
virtue
of
a
man
of
a
woman
of
an
old
man
and
of
a
child
there
is
a
virtue
of
every
age
and
state
of
life
all
of
which
may
be
easily
described
socrates
reminds
meno
that
this
is
only
an
enumeration
of
the
virtues
and
not
a
definition
of
the
notion
which
is
common
to
them
all
in
a
second
attempt
meno
defines
virtue
to
be
power
of
command
but
to
this
again
exceptions
are
taken
for
there
must
be
a
virtue
of
those
who
obey
as
well
as
of
those
who
command
and
the
power
of
command
must
be
justly
or
not
unjustly
exercised
meno
is
very
ready
to
admit
that
justice
is
virtue
you
say
virtue
or
a
virtue
for
there
are
other
virtues
such
as
courage
temperance
and
the
like
just
as
round
is
a
figure
and
black
and
white
are
colours
and
yet
there
are
other
figures
and
other
colours
let
meno
take
the
examples
of
figure
and
colour
and
try
to
define
them
meno
confesses
his
inability
and
after
a
process
of
interrogation
in
which
socrates
explains
to
him
the
nature
of
a
in
multis
socrates
himself
defines
figure
as
accompaniment
of
colour
but
some
one
may
object
that
he
does
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
if
he
is
a
candid
friend
and
not
a
mere
disputant
socrates
is
willing
to
furnish
him
with
a
simpler
and
more
philosophical
definition
into
which
no
disputed
word
is
allowed
to
intrude
is
the
limit
of
form
meno
imperiously
insists
that
he
must
still
have
a
definition
of
colour
some
raillery
follows
and
at
length
socrates
is
induced
to
reply
colour
is
the
effluence
of
form
sensible
and
in
due
proportion
to
the
sight
this
definition
is
exactly
suited
to
the
taste
of
meno
who
welcomes
the
familiar
language
of
gorgias
and
empedocles
socrates
is
of
opinion
that
the
more
abstract
or
dialectical
definition
of
figure
is
far
better
now
that
meno
has
been
made
to
understand
the
nature
of
a
general
definition
he
answers
in
the
spirit
of
a
greek
gentleman
and
in
the
words
of
a
poet
virtue
is
to
delight
in
things
honourable
and
to
have
the
power
of
getting
them
this
is
a
nearer
approximation
than
he
has
yet
made
to
a
complete
definition
and
regarded
as
a
piece
of
proverbial
or
popular
morality
is
not
far
from
the
truth
but
the
objection
is
urged
the
honourable
is
the
good
and
as
every
one
equally
desires
the
good
the
point
of
the
definition
is
contained
in
the
words
power
of
getting
them
they
must
be
got
justly
or
with
justice
the
definition
will
then
stand
thus
is
the
power
of
getting
good
with
justice
but
justice
is
a
part
of
virtue
and
therefore
virtue
is
the
getting
of
good
with
a
part
of
virtue
the
definition
repeats
the
word
defined
meno
complains
that
the
conversation
of
socrates
has
the
effect
of
a
torpedo
shock
upon
him
when
he
talks
with
other
persons
he
has
plenty
to
say
about
virtue
in
the
presence
of
socrates
his
thoughts
desert
him
socrates
replies
that
he
is
only
the
cause
of
perplexity
in
others
because
he
is
himself
perplexed
he
proposes
to
continue
the
enquiry
but
how
asks
meno
can
he
enquire
either
into
what
he
knows
or
into
what
he
does
not
know
this
is
a
sophistical
puzzle
which
as
socrates
remarks
saves
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
him
who
accepts
it
but
the
puzzle
has
a
real
difficulty
latent
under
it
to
which
socrates
will
endeavour
to
find
a
reply
the
difficulty
is
the
origin
of
knowledge
he
has
heard
from
priests
and
priestesses
and
from
the
poet
pindar
of
an
immortal
soul
which
is
born
again
and
again
in
successive
periods
of
existence
returning
into
this
world
when
she
has
paid
the
penalty
of
ancient
crime
and
having
wandered
over
all
places
of
the
upper
and
under
world
and
seen
and
known
all
things
at
one
time
or
other
is
by
association
out
of
one
thing
capable
of
recovering
all
for
nature
is
of
one
kindred
and
every
soul
has
a
seed
or
germ
which
may
be
developed
into
all
knowledge
the
existence
of
this
latent
knowledge
is
further
proved
by
the
interrogation
of
one
of
meno
slaves
who
in
the
skilful
hands
of
socrates
is
made
to
acknowledge
some
elementary
relations
of
geometrical
figures
the
theorem
that
the
square
of
the
diagonal
is
double
the
square
of
the
side
that
famous
discovery
of
primitive
mathematics
in
honour
of
which
the
legendary
pythagoras
is
said
to
have
sacrificed
a
hecatomb
is
elicited
from
him
the
first
step
in
the
process
of
teaching
has
made
him
conscious
of
his
own
ignorance
he
has
had
the
shock
given
him
and
is
the
better
for
the
operation
but
whence
had
the
uneducated
man
this
knowledge
he
had
never
learnt
geometry
in
this
world
nor
was
it
born
with
him
he
must
therefore
have
had
it
when
he
was
not
a
man
and
as
he
always
either
was
or
was
not
a
man
he
must
have
always
had
it
compare
phaedo
after
socrates
has
given
this
specimen
of
the
true
nature
of
teaching
the
original
question
of
the
teachableness
of
virtue
is
renewed
again
he
professes
a
desire
to
know
virtue
is
first
but
he
is
willing
to
argue
the
question
as
mathematicians
say
under
an
hypothesis
he
will
assume
that
if
virtue
is
knowledge
then
virtue
can
be
taught
this
was
the
stage
of
the
argument
at
which
the
protagoras
concluded
socrates
has
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
virtue
is
a
good
and
that
goods
whether
of
body
or
mind
must
be
under
the
direction
of
knowledge
upon
the
assumption
just
made
then
virtue
is
teachable
but
where
are
the
teachers
there
are
none
to
be
found
this
is
extremely
discouraging
virtue
is
no
sooner
discovered
to
be
teachable
than
the
discovery
follows
that
it
is
not
taught
virtue
therefore
is
and
is
not
teachable
in
this
dilemma
an
appeal
is
made
to
anytus
a
respectable
and
citizen
of
the
old
school
and
a
family
friend
of
meno
who
happens
to
be
present
he
is
asked
meno
shall
go
to
the
sophists
and
be
taught
the
suggestion
throws
him
into
a
rage
whom
then
shall
meno
go
asks
socrates
to
any
athenian
gentleman
to
the
great
athenian
statesmen
of
past
times
socrates
replies
here
as
elsewhere
laches
prot
that
themistocles
pericles
and
other
great
men
had
sons
to
whom
they
would
surely
if
they
could
have
done
so
have
imparted
their
own
political
wisdom
but
no
one
ever
heard
that
these
sons
of
theirs
were
remarkable
for
anything
except
riding
and
wrestling
and
similar
accomplishments
anytus
is
angry
at
the
imputation
which
is
cast
on
his
favourite
statesmen
and
on
a
class
to
which
he
supposes
himself
to
belong
he
breaks
off
with
a
significant
hint
the
mention
of
another
opportunity
of
talking
with
him
and
the
suggestion
that
meno
may
do
the
athenian
people
a
service
by
pacifying
him
are
evident
allusions
to
the
trial
of
socrates
socrates
returns
to
the
consideration
of
the
question
virtue
is
teachable
which
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
there
are
no
teachers
of
it
for
the
sophists
are
bad
teachers
and
the
rest
of
the
world
do
not
profess
to
teach
but
there
is
another
point
which
we
failed
to
observe
and
in
which
gorgias
has
never
instructed
meno
nor
prodicus
socrates
this
is
the
nature
of
right
opinion
for
virtue
may
be
under
the
guidance
of
right
opinion
as
well
as
of
knowledge
and
right
opinion
is
for
practical
purposes
as
good
as
knowledge
but
is
incapable
of
being
taught
and
is
also
liable
like
the
images
of
daedalus
to
off
because
not
bound
by
the
tie
of
the
cause
this
is
the
sort
of
instinct
which
is
possessed
by
statesmen
who
are
not
wise
or
knowing
persons
but
only
inspired
or
divine
the
higher
virtue
which
is
identical
with
knowledge
is
an
ideal
only
if
the
statesman
had
this
knowledge
and
could
teach
what
he
knew
he
would
be
like
tiresias
in
the
world
below
alone
has
wisdom
but
the
rest
flit
like
shadows
this
dialogue
is
an
attempt
to
answer
the
question
can
virtue
be
taught
no
one
would
either
ask
or
answer
such
a
question
in
modern
times
but
in
the
age
of
socrates
it
was
only
by
an
effort
that
the
mind
could
rise
to
a
general
notion
of
virtue
as
distinct
from
the
particular
virtues
of
courage
liberality
and
the
like
and
when
a
hazy
conception
of
this
ideal
was
attained
it
was
only
by
a
further
effort
that
the
question
of
the
teachableness
of
virtue
could
be
resolved
the
answer
which
is
given
by
plato
is
paradoxical
enough
and
seems
rather
intended
to
stimulate
than
to
satisfy
enquiry
virtue
is
knowledge
and
therefore
virtue
can
be
taught
but
virtue
is
not
taught
and
therefore
in
this
higher
and
ideal
sense
there
is
no
virtue
and
no
knowledge
the
teaching
of
the
sophists
is
confessedly
inadequate
and
meno
who
is
their
pupil
is
ignorant
of
the
very
nature
of
general
terms
he
can
only
produce
out
of
their
armoury
the
sophism
you
can
neither
enquire
into
what
you
know
nor
into
what
you
do
not
know
to
which
socrates
replies
by
his
theory
of
reminiscence
to
the
doctrine
that
virtue
is
knowledge
plato
has
been
constantly
tending
in
the
previous
dialogues
but
the
new
truth
is
no
sooner
found
than
it
vanishes
away
there
is
knowledge
there
must
be
teachers
and
where
are
the
teachers
there
is
no
knowledge
in
the
higher
sense
of
systematic
connected
reasoned
knowledge
such
as
may
one
day
be
attained
and
such
as
plato
himself
seems
to
see
in
some
far
off
vision
of
a
single
science
and
there
are
no
teachers
in
the
higher
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
no
real
teachers
who
will
arouse
the
spirit
of
enquiry
in
their
pupils
and
not
merely
instruct
them
in
rhetoric
or
impart
to
them
information
for
a
fee
of
or
of
drachms
plato
is
desirous
of
deepening
the
notion
of
education
and
therefore
he
asserts
the
paradox
that
there
are
no
educators
this
paradox
though
different
in
form
is
not
really
different
from
the
remark
which
is
often
made
in
modern
times
by
those
who
would
depreciate
either
the
methods
of
education
commonly
employed
or
the
standard
attained
that
is
no
true
education
among
us
there
remains
still
a
possibility
which
must
not
be
overlooked
even
if
there
be
no
true
knowledge
as
is
proved
by
wretched
state
of
education
there
may
be
right
opinion
which
is
a
sort
of
guessing
or
divination
resting
on
no
knowledge
of
causes
and
incommunicable
to
others
this
is
the
gift
which
our
statesmen
have
as
is
proved
by
the
circumstance
that
they
are
unable
to
impart
their
knowledge
to
their
sons
those
who
are
possessed
of
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
men
of
science
or
philosophers
but
they
are
inspired
and
divine
there
may
be
some
trace
of
irony
in
this
curious
passage
which
forms
the
concluding
portion
of
the
dialogue
but
plato
certainly
does
not
mean
to
intimate
that
the
supernatural
or
divine
is
the
true
basis
of
human
life
to
him
knowledge
if
only
attainable
in
this
world
is
of
all
things
the
most
divine
yet
like
other
philosophers
he
is
willing
to
admit
that
is
the
guide
of
life
butler
analogy
and
he
is
at
the
same
time
desirous
of
contrasting
the
wisdom
which
governs
the
world
with
a
higher
wisdom
there
are
many
instincts
judgments
and
anticipations
of
the
human
mind
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
rule
and
of
which
the
grounds
can
not
always
be
given
in
words
a
person
may
have
some
skill
or
latent
experience
which
he
is
able
to
use
himself
and
is
yet
unable
to
teach
others
because
he
has
no
principles
and
is
incapable
of
collecting
or
arranging
his
ideas
he
has
practice
but
not
theory
art
but
not
science
this
is
a
true
fact
of
psychology
which
is
recognized
by
plato
in
this
passage
but
he
is
far
from
saying
as
some
have
imagined
that
inspiration
or
divine
grace
is
to
be
regarded
as
higher
than
knowledge
he
would
not
have
preferred
the
poet
or
man
of
action
to
the
philosopher
or
the
virtue
of
custom
to
the
virtue
based
upon
ideas
also
here
as
in
the
ion
and
phaedrus
plato
appears
to
acknowledge
an
unreasoning
element
in
the
higher
nature
of
man
the
philosopher
only
has
knowledge
and
yet
the
statesman
and
the
poet
are
inspired
there
may
be
a
sort
of
irony
in
regarding
in
this
way
the
gifts
of
genius
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
is
deriding
them
any
more
than
he
is
deriding
the
phenomena
of
love
or
of
enthusiasm
in
the
symposium
or
of
oracles
in
the
apology
or
of
divine
intimations
when
he
is
speaking
of
the
daemonium
of
socrates
he
recognizes
the
lower
form
of
right
opinion
as
well
as
the
higher
one
of
science
in
the
spirit
of
one
who
desires
to
include
in
his
philosophy
every
aspect
of
human
life
just
as
he
recognizes
the
existence
of
popular
opinion
as
a
fact
and
the
sophists
as
the
expression
of
it
this
dialogue
contains
the
first
intimation
of
the
doctrine
of
reminiscence
and
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
proof
is
very
slight
even
slighter
than
in
the
phaedo
and
republic
because
men
had
abstract
ideas
in
a
previous
state
they
must
have
always
had
them
and
their
souls
therefore
must
have
always
existed
for
they
must
always
have
been
either
men
or
not
men
the
fallacy
of
the
latter
words
is
transparent
and
socrates
himself
appears
to
be
conscious
of
their
weakness
for
he
adds
immediately
afterwards
have
said
some
things
of
which
i
am
not
altogether
confident
compare
phaedo
it
may
be
observed
however
that
the
fanciful
notion
of
is
combined
with
a
true
but
partial
view
of
the
origin
and
unity
of
knowledge
and
of
the
association
of
ideas
knowledge
is
prior
to
any
particular
knowledge
and
exists
not
in
the
previous
state
of
the
individual
but
of
the
race
it
is
potential
not
actual
and
can
only
be
appropriated
by
strenuous
exertion
the
idealism
of
plato
is
here
presented
in
a
less
developed
form
than
in
the
phaedo
and
phaedrus
nothing
is
said
of
the
of
ideas
of
justice
temperance
and
the
like
nor
is
socrates
positive
of
anything
but
the
duty
of
enquiry
the
doctrine
of
reminiscence
too
is
explained
more
in
accordance
with
fact
and
experience
as
arising
out
of
the
affinities
of
nature
ate
tes
thuseos
oles
suggenous
ouses
modern
philosophy
says
that
all
things
in
nature
are
dependent
on
one
another
the
ancient
philosopher
had
the
same
truth
latent
in
his
mind
when
he
affirmed
that
out
of
one
thing
all
the
rest
may
be
recovered
the
subjective
was
converted
by
him
into
an
objective
the
mental
phenomenon
of
the
association
of
ideas
compare
phaedo
became
a
real
chain
of
existences
the
germs
of
two
valuable
principles
of
education
may
also
be
gathered
from
the
of
priests
and
priestesses
that
true
knowledge
is
a
knowledge
of
causes
compare
aristotle
theory
of
episteme
and
that
the
process
of
learning
consists
not
in
what
is
brought
to
the
learner
but
in
what
is
drawn
out
of
him
some
lesser
points
of
the
dialogue
may
be
noted
such
as
the
acute
observation
that
meno
prefers
the
familiar
definition
which
is
embellished
with
poetical
language
to
the
better
and
truer
one
or
the
shrewd
reflection
which
may
admit
of
an
application
to
modern
as
well
as
to
ancient
teachers
that
the
sophists
having
made
large
fortunes
this
must
surely
be
a
criterion
of
their
powers
of
teaching
for
that
no
man
could
get
a
living
by
shoemaking
who
was
not
a
good
shoemaker
or
the
remark
conveyed
almost
in
a
word
that
the
verbal
sceptic
is
saved
the
labour
of
thought
and
enquiry
ouden
dei
to
toiouto
zeteseos
characteristic
also
of
the
temper
of
the
socratic
enquiry
is
the
proposal
to
discuss
the
teachableness
of
virtue
under
an
hypothesis
after
the
manner
of
the
mathematicians
and
the
repetition
of
the
favourite
doctrine
which
occurs
so
frequently
in
the
earlier
and
more
socratic
dialogues
and
gives
a
colour
to
all
of
them
that
mankind
only
desire
evil
through
ignorance
the
experiment
of
eliciting
from
the
the
mathematical
truth
which
is
latent
in
him
and
the
remark
that
he
is
all
the
better
for
knowing
his
ignorance
the
character
of
meno
like
that
of
critias
has
no
relation
to
the
actual
circumstances
of
his
life
plato
is
silent
about
his
treachery
to
the
ten
thousand
greeks
which
xenophon
has
recorded
as
he
is
also
silent
about
the
crimes
of
critias
he
is
a
thessalian
alcibiades
rich
and
luxurious
a
spoilt
child
of
fortune
and
is
described
as
the
hereditary
friend
of
the
great
king
like
alcibiades
he
is
inspired
with
an
ardent
desire
of
knowledge
and
is
equally
willing
to
learn
of
socrates
and
of
the
sophists
he
may
be
regarded
as
standing
in
the
same
relation
to
gorgias
as
hippocrates
in
the
protagoras
to
the
other
great
sophist
he
is
the
sophisticated
youth
on
whom
socrates
tries
his
powers
just
as
in
the
charmides
the
lysis
and
the
euthydemus
ingenuous
boyhood
is
made
the
subject
of
a
similar
experiment
he
is
treated
by
socrates
in
a
manner
suited
to
his
character
at
the
same
time
he
appears
not
quite
to
understand
the
process
to
which
he
is
being
subjected
for
he
is
exhibited
as
ignorant
of
the
very
elements
of
dialectics
in
which
the
sophists
have
failed
to
instruct
their
disciple
his
definition
of
virtue
as
power
and
desire
of
attaining
things
honourable
like
the
first
definition
of
justice
in
the
republic
is
taken
from
a
poet
his
answers
have
a
sophistical
ring
and
at
the
same
time
show
the
sophistical
incapacity
to
grasp
a
general
notion
anytus
is
the
type
of
the
man
of
the
world
who
is
indignant
at
innovation
and
equally
detests
the
popular
teacher
and
the
true
philosopher
he
seems
like
aristophanes
to
regard
the
new
opinions
whether
of
socrates
or
the
sophists
as
fatal
to
athenian
greatness
he
is
of
the
same
class
as
callicles
in
the
gorgias
but
of
a
different
variety
the
immoral
and
sophistical
doctrines
of
callicles
are
not
attributed
to
him
the
moderation
with
which
he
is
described
is
remarkable
if
he
be
the
accuser
of
socrates
as
is
apparently
indicated
by
his
parting
words
perhaps
plato
may
have
been
desirous
of
showing
that
the
accusation
of
socrates
was
not
to
be
attributed
to
badness
or
malevolence
but
rather
to
a
tendency
in
men
minds
or
he
may
have
been
regardless
of
the
historical
truth
of
the
characters
of
his
dialogue
as
in
the
case
of
meno
and
critias
like
chaerephon
apol
the
real
anytus
was
a
democrat
and
had
joined
thrasybulus
in
the
conflict
with
the
thirty
the
protagoras
arrived
at
a
sort
of
hypothetical
conclusion
that
if
is
knowledge
it
can
be
taught
in
the
euthydemus
socrates
himself
offered
an
example
of
the
manner
in
which
the
true
teacher
may
draw
out
the
mind
of
youth
this
was
in
contrast
to
the
quibbling
follies
of
the
sophists
in
the
meno
the
subject
is
more
developed
the
foundations
of
the
enquiry
are
laid
deeper
and
the
nature
of
knowledge
is
more
distinctly
explained
there
is
a
progression
by
antagonism
of
two
opposite
aspects
of
philosophy
but
at
the
moment
when
we
approach
nearest
the
truth
doubles
upon
us
and
passes
out
of
our
reach
we
seem
to
find
that
the
ideal
of
knowledge
is
irreconcilable
with
experience
in
human
life
there
is
indeed
the
profession
of
knowledge
but
right
opinion
is
our
actual
guide
there
is
another
sort
of
progress
from
the
general
notions
of
socrates
who
asked
simply
is
friendship
is
temperance
is
courage
as
in
the
lysis
charmides
laches
to
the
transcendentalism
of
plato
who
in
the
second
stage
of
his
philosophy
sought
to
find
the
nature
of
knowledge
in
a
prior
and
future
state
of
existence
the
difficulty
in
framing
general
notions
which
has
appeared
in
this
and
in
all
the
previous
dialogues
recurs
in
the
gorgias
and
theaetetus
as
well
as
in
the
republic
in
the
gorgias
too
the
statesmen
reappear
but
in
stronger
opposition
to
the
philosopher
they
are
no
longer
allowed
to
have
a
divine
insight
but
though
acknowledged
to
have
been
clever
men
and
good
speakers
are
denounced
as
leaders
of
the
blind
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
also
carried
further
being
made
the
foundation
not
only
of
a
theory
of
knowledge
but
of
a
doctrine
of
rewards
and
punishments
in
the
republic
the
relation
of
knowledge
to
virtue
is
described
in
a
manner
more
consistent
with
modern
distinctions
the
existence
of
the
virtues
without
the
possession
of
knowledge
in
the
higher
or
philosophical
sense
is
admitted
to
be
possible
right
opinion
is
again
introduced
in
the
theaetetus
as
an
account
of
knowledge
but
is
rejected
on
the
ground
that
it
is
irrational
as
here
because
it
is
not
bound
by
the
tie
of
the
cause
and
also
because
the
conception
of
false
opinion
is
given
up
as
hopeless
the
doctrines
of
plato
are
necessarily
different
at
different
times
of
his
life
as
new
distinctions
are
realized
or
new
stages
of
thought
attained
by
him
we
are
not
therefore
justified
in
order
to
take
away
the
appearance
of
inconsistency
in
attributing
to
him
hidden
meanings
or
remote
allusions
there
are
no
external
criteria
by
which
we
can
determine
the
date
of
the
meno
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
of
the
dialogues
of
plato
were
written
before
the
death
of
socrates
the
meno
which
appears
to
be
one
of
the
earliest
of
them
is
proved
to
have
been
of
a
later
date
by
the
allusion
of
anytus
we
can
not
argue
that
plato
was
more
likely
to
have
written
as
he
has
done
of
meno
before
than
after
his
miserable
death
for
we
have
already
seen
in
the
examples
of
charmides
and
critias
that
the
characters
in
plato
are
very
far
from
resembling
the
same
characters
in
history
the
repulsive
picture
which
is
given
of
him
in
the
anabasis
of
xenophon
where
he
also
appears
as
the
friend
of
aristippus
a
fair
youth
having
lovers
has
no
other
trait
of
likeness
to
the
meno
of
plato
the
place
of
the
meno
in
the
series
is
doubtfully
indicated
by
internal
evidence
the
main
character
of
the
dialogue
is
socrates
but
to
the
definitions
of
socrates
is
added
the
platonic
doctrine
of
reminiscence
the
problems
of
virtue
and
knowledge
have
been
discussed
in
the
lysis
laches
charmides
and
protagoras
the
puzzle
about
knowing
and
learning
has
already
appeared
in
the
euthydemus
the
doctrines
of
immortality
and
are
carried
further
in
the
phaedrus
and
phaedo
the
distinction
between
opinion
and
knowledge
is
more
fully
developed
in
the
theaetetus
the
lessons
of
prodicus
whom
he
facetiously
calls
his
master
are
still
running
in
the
mind
of
socrates
unlike
the
later
platonic
dialogues
the
meno
arrives
at
no
conclusion
hence
we
are
led
to
place
the
dialogue
at
some
point
of
time
later
than
the
protagoras
and
earlier
than
the
phaedrus
and
gorgias
the
place
which
is
assigned
to
it
in
this
work
is
due
mainly
to
the
desire
to
bring
together
in
a
single
volume
all
the
dialogues
which
contain
allusions
to
the
trial
and
death
of
socrates
on
the
ideas
of
plato
plato
doctrine
of
ideas
has
attained
an
imaginary
clearness
and
definiteness
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
his
own
writings
the
popular
account
of
them
is
partly
derived
from
one
or
two
passages
in
his
dialogues
interpreted
without
regard
to
their
poetical
environment
it
is
due
also
to
the
misunderstanding
of
him
by
the
aristotelian
school
and
the
erroneous
notion
has
been
further
narrowed
and
has
become
fixed
by
the
realism
of
the
schoolmen
this
popular
view
of
the
platonic
ideas
may
be
summed
up
in
some
such
formula
as
the
following
consists
not
in
particulars
but
in
universals
which
have
a
place
in
the
mind
of
god
or
in
some
heaven
these
were
revealed
to
men
in
a
former
state
of
existence
and
are
recovered
by
reminiscence
anamnesis
or
association
from
sensible
things
the
sensible
things
are
not
realities
but
shadows
only
in
relation
to
the
truth
these
unmeaning
propositions
are
hardly
suspected
to
be
a
caricature
of
a
great
theory
of
knowledge
which
plato
in
various
ways
and
under
many
figures
of
speech
is
seeking
to
unfold
poetry
has
been
converted
into
dogma
and
it
is
not
remarked
that
the
platonic
ideas
are
to
be
found
only
in
about
a
third
of
plato
writings
and
are
not
confined
to
him
the
forms
which
they
assume
are
numerous
and
if
taken
literally
inconsistent
with
one
another
at
one
time
we
are
in
the
clouds
of
mythology
at
another
among
the
abstractions
of
mathematics
or
metaphysics
we
pass
imperceptibly
from
one
to
the
other
reason
and
fancy
are
mingled
in
the
same
passage
the
ideas
are
sometimes
described
as
many
coextensive
with
the
universals
of
sense
and
also
with
the
first
principles
of
ethics
or
again
they
are
absorbed
into
the
single
idea
of
good
and
subordinated
to
it
they
are
not
more
certain
than
facts
but
they
are
equally
certain
phaedo
they
are
both
personal
and
impersonal
they
are
abstract
terms
they
are
also
the
causes
of
things
and
they
are
even
transformed
into
the
demons
or
spirits
by
whose
help
god
made
the
world
and
the
idea
of
good
republic
may
without
violence
be
converted
into
the
supreme
being
who
he
was
good
created
all
things
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
try
and
reconcile
these
differing
modes
of
thought
they
are
not
to
be
regarded
seriously
as
having
a
distinct
meaning
they
are
parables
prophecies
myths
symbols
revelations
aspirations
after
an
unknown
world
they
derive
their
origin
from
a
deep
religious
and
contemplative
feeling
and
also
from
an
observation
of
curious
mental
phenomena
they
gather
up
the
elements
of
the
previous
philosophies
which
they
put
together
in
a
new
form
their
great
diversity
shows
the
tentative
character
of
early
endeavours
to
think
they
have
not
yet
settled
down
into
a
single
system
plato
uses
them
though
he
also
criticises
them
he
acknowledges
that
both
he
and
others
are
always
talking
about
them
especially
about
the
idea
of
good
and
that
they
are
not
peculiar
to
himself
phaedo
republic
but
in
his
later
writings
he
seems
to
have
laid
aside
the
old
forms
of
them
as
he
proceeds
he
makes
for
himself
new
modes
of
expression
more
akin
to
the
aristotelian
logic
yet
amid
all
these
varieties
and
incongruities
there
is
a
common
meaning
or
spirit
which
pervades
his
writings
both
those
in
which
he
treats
of
the
ideas
and
those
in
which
he
is
silent
about
them
this
is
the
spirit
of
idealism
which
in
the
history
of
philosophy
has
had
many
names
and
taken
many
forms
and
has
in
a
measure
influenced
those
who
seemed
to
be
most
averse
to
it
it
has
often
been
charged
with
inconsistency
and
fancifulness
and
yet
has
had
an
elevating
effect
on
human
nature
and
has
exercised
a
wonderful
charm
and
interest
over
a
few
spirits
who
have
been
lost
in
the
thought
of
it
it
has
been
banished
again
and
again
but
has
always
returned
it
has
attempted
to
leave
the
earth
and
soar
heavenwards
but
soon
has
found
that
only
in
experience
could
any
solid
foundation
of
knowledge
be
laid
it
has
degenerated
into
pantheism
but
has
again
emerged
no
other
knowledge
has
given
an
equal
stimulus
to
the
mind
it
is
the
science
of
sciences
which
are
also
ideas
and
under
either
aspect
require
to
be
defined
they
can
only
be
thought
of
in
due
proportion
when
conceived
in
relation
to
one
another
they
are
the
glasses
through
which
the
kingdoms
of
science
are
seen
but
at
a
distance
all
the
greatest
minds
except
when
living
in
an
age
of
reaction
against
them
have
unconsciously
fallen
under
their
power
the
account
of
the
platonic
ideas
in
the
meno
is
the
simplest
and
clearest
and
we
shall
best
illustrate
their
nature
by
giving
this
first
and
then
comparing
the
manner
in
which
they
are
described
elsewhere
in
the
phaedrus
phaedo
republic
to
which
may
be
added
the
criticism
of
them
in
the
parmenides
the
personal
form
which
is
attributed
to
them
in
the
timaeus
the
logical
character
which
they
assume
in
the
sophist
and
philebus
and
the
allusion
to
them
in
the
laws
in
the
cratylus
they
dawn
upon
him
with
the
freshness
of
a
thought
the
meno
goes
back
to
a
former
state
of
existence
in
which
men
did
and
suffered
good
and
evil
and
received
the
reward
or
punishment
of
them
until
their
sin
was
purged
away
and
they
were
allowed
to
return
to
earth
this
is
a
tradition
of
the
olden
time
to
which
priests
and
poets
bear
witness
the
souls
of
men
returning
to
earth
bring
back
a
latent
memory
of
ideas
which
were
known
to
them
in
a
former
state
the
recollection
is
awakened
into
life
and
consciousness
by
the
sight
of
the
things
which
resemble
them
on
earth
the
soul
evidently
possesses
such
innate
ideas
before
she
has
had
time
to
acquire
them
this
is
proved
by
an
experiment
tried
on
one
of
meno
slaves
from
whom
socrates
elicits
truths
of
arithmetic
and
geometry
which
he
had
never
learned
in
this
world
he
must
therefore
have
brought
them
with
him
from
another
the
notion
of
a
previous
state
of
existence
is
found
in
the
verses
of
empedocles
and
in
the
fragments
of
heracleitus
it
was
the
natural
answer
to
two
questions
came
the
soul
what
is
the
origin
of
evil
and
prevailed
far
and
wide
in
the
east
it
found
its
way
into
hellas
probably
through
the
medium
of
orphic
and
pythagorean
rites
and
mysteries
it
was
easier
to
think
of
a
former
than
of
a
future
life
because
such
a
life
has
really
existed
for
the
race
though
not
for
the
individual
and
all
men
come
into
the
world
if
not
clouds
of
glory
at
any
rate
able
to
enter
into
the
inheritance
of
the
past
in
the
phaedrus
as
well
as
in
the
meno
it
is
this
former
rather
than
a
future
life
on
which
plato
is
disposed
to
dwell
there
the
gods
and
men
following
in
their
train
go
forth
to
contemplate
the
heavens
and
are
borne
round
in
the
revolutions
of
them
there
they
see
the
divine
forms
of
justice
temperance
and
the
like
in
their
unchangeable
beauty
but
not
without
an
effort
more
than
human
the
soul
of
man
is
likened
to
a
charioteer
and
two
steeds
one
mortal
the
other
immortal
the
charioteer
and
the
mortal
steed
are
in
fierce
conflict
at
length
the
animal
principle
is
finally
overpowered
though
not
extinguished
by
the
combined
energies
of
the
passionate
and
rational
elements
this
is
one
of
those
passages
in
plato
which
partaking
both
of
a
philosophical
and
poetical
character
is
necessarily
indistinct
and
inconsistent
the
magnificent
figure
under
which
the
nature
of
the
soul
is
described
has
not
much
to
do
with
the
popular
doctrine
of
the
ideas
yet
there
is
one
little
trait
in
the
description
which
shows
that
they
are
present
to
plato
mind
namely
the
remark
that
the
soul
which
had
seen
truths
in
the
form
of
the
universal
can
not
again
return
to
the
nature
of
an
animal
in
the
phaedo
as
in
the
meno
the
origin
of
ideas
is
sought
for
in
a
previous
state
of
existence
there
was
no
time
when
they
could
have
been
acquired
in
this
life
and
therefore
they
must
have
been
recovered
from
another
the
process
of
recovery
is
no
other
than
the
ordinary
law
of
association
by
which
in
daily
life
the
sight
of
one
thing
or
person
recalls
another
to
our
minds
and
by
which
in
scientific
enquiry
from
any
part
of
knowledge
we
may
be
led
on
to
infer
the
whole
it
is
also
argued
that
ideas
or
rather
ideals
must
be
derived
from
a
previous
state
of
existence
because
they
are
more
perfect
than
the
sensible
forms
of
them
which
are
given
by
experience
but
in
the
phaedo
the
doctrine
of
ideas
is
subordinate
to
the
proof
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
soul
existed
in
a
previous
state
then
it
will
exist
in
a
future
state
for
a
law
of
alternation
pervades
all
things
and
the
ideas
exist
then
the
soul
exists
if
not
not
it
is
to
be
observed
both
in
the
meno
and
the
phaedo
that
socrates
expresses
himself
with
diffidence
he
speaks
in
the
phaedo
of
the
words
with
which
he
has
comforted
himself
and
his
friends
and
will
not
be
too
confident
that
the
description
which
he
has
given
of
the
soul
and
her
mansions
is
exactly
true
but
he
to
think
that
something
of
the
kind
is
true
and
in
the
meno
after
dwelling
upon
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
adds
some
things
which
i
have
said
i
am
not
altogether
confident
compare
apology
gorgias
from
this
class
of
uncertainties
he
exempts
the
difference
between
truth
and
appearance
of
which
he
is
absolutely
convinced
in
the
republic
the
ideas
are
spoken
of
in
two
ways
which
though
not
contradictory
are
different
in
the
tenth
book
they
are
represented
as
the
genera
or
general
ideas
under
which
individuals
having
a
common
name
are
contained
for
example
there
is
the
bed
which
the
carpenter
makes
the
picture
of
the
bed
which
is
drawn
by
the
painter
the
bed
existing
in
nature
of
which
god
is
the
author
of
the
latter
all
visible
beds
are
only
the
shadows
or
reflections
this
and
similar
illustrations
or
explanations
are
put
forth
not
for
their
own
sake
or
as
an
exposition
of
plato
theory
of
ideas
but
with
a
view
of
showing
that
poetry
and
the
mimetic
arts
are
concerned
with
an
inferior
part
of
the
soul
and
a
lower
kind
of
knowledge
on
the
other
hand
in
the
and
books
of
the
republic
we
reach
the
highest
and
most
perfect
conception
which
plato
is
able
to
attain
of
the
nature
of
knowledge
the
ideas
are
now
finally
seen
to
be
one
as
well
as
many
causes
as
well
as
ideas
and
to
have
a
unity
which
is
the
idea
of
good
and
the
cause
of
all
the
rest
they
seem
however
to
have
lost
their
first
aspect
of
universals
under
which
individuals
are
contained
and
to
have
been
converted
into
forms
of
another
kind
which
are
inconsistently
regarded
from
the
one
side
as
images
or
ideals
of
justice
temperance
holiness
and
the
like
from
the
other
as
hypotheses
or
mathematical
truths
or
principles
in
the
timaeus
which
in
the
series
of
plato
works
immediately
follows
the
republic
though
probably
written
some
time
afterwards
no
mention
occurs
of
the
doctrine
of
ideas
geometrical
forms
and
arithmetical
ratios
furnish
the
laws
according
to
which
the
world
is
created
but
though
the
conception
of
the
ideas
as
genera
or
species
is
forgotten
or
laid
aside
the
distinction
of
the
visible
and
intellectual
is
as
firmly
maintained
as
ever
the
idea
of
good
likewise
disappears
and
is
superseded
by
the
conception
of
a
personal
god
who
works
according
to
a
final
cause
or
principle
of
goodness
which
he
himself
is
no
doubt
is
expressed
by
plato
either
in
the
timaeus
or
in
any
other
dialogue
of
the
truths
which
he
conceives
to
be
the
first
and
highest
it
is
not
the
existence
of
god
or
the
idea
of
good
which
he
approaches
in
a
tentative
or
hesitating
manner
but
the
investigations
of
physiology
these
he
regards
not
seriously
as
a
part
of
philosophy
but
as
an
innocent
recreation
passing
on
to
the
parmenides
we
find
in
that
dialogue
not
an
exposition
or
defence
of
the
doctrine
of
ideas
but
an
assault
upon
them
which
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
veteran
parmenides
and
might
be
ascribed
to
aristotle
himself
or
to
one
of
his
disciples
the
doctrine
which
is
assailed
takes
two
or
three
forms
but
fails
in
any
of
them
to
escape
the
dialectical
difficulties
which
are
urged
against
it
it
is
admitted
that
there
are
ideas
of
all
things
but
the
manner
in
which
individuals
partake
of
them
whether
of
the
whole
or
of
the
part
and
in
which
they
become
like
them
or
how
ideas
can
be
either
within
or
without
the
sphere
of
human
knowledge
or
how
the
human
and
divine
can
have
any
relation
to
each
other
is
held
to
be
incapable
of
explanation
and
yet
if
there
are
no
universal
ideas
what
becomes
of
philosophy
parmenides
in
the
sophist
the
theory
of
ideas
is
spoken
of
as
a
doctrine
held
not
by
plato
but
by
another
sect
of
philosophers
called
friends
of
ideas
probably
the
megarians
who
were
very
distinct
from
him
if
not
opposed
to
him
sophist
nor
in
what
may
be
termed
plato
abridgement
of
the
history
of
philosophy
soph
is
any
mention
made
such
as
we
find
in
the
first
book
of
aristotle
metaphysics
of
the
derivation
of
such
a
theory
or
of
any
part
of
it
from
the
pythagoreans
the
eleatics
the
heracleiteans
or
even
from
socrates
in
the
philebus
probably
one
of
the
latest
of
the
platonic
dialogues
the
conception
of
a
personal
or
deity
expressed
under
the
figure
of
mind
the
king
of
all
who
is
also
the
cause
is
retained
the
one
and
many
of
the
phaedrus
and
theaetetus
is
still
working
in
the
mind
of
plato
and
the
correlation
of
ideas
not
of
with
all
but
of
with
some
is
asserted
and
explained
but
they
are
spoken
of
in
a
different
manner
and
are
not
supposed
to
be
recovered
from
a
former
state
of
existence
the
metaphysical
conception
of
truth
passes
into
a
psychological
one
which
is
continued
in
the
laws
and
is
the
final
form
of
the
platonic
philosophy
so
far
as
can
be
gathered
from
his
own
writings
see
especially
laws
in
the
laws
he
harps
once
more
on
the
old
string
and
returns
to
general
notions
these
he
acknowledges
to
be
many
and
yet
he
insists
that
they
are
also
one
the
guardian
must
be
made
to
recognize
the
truth
for
which
he
has
contended
long
ago
in
the
protagoras
that
the
virtues
are
four
but
they
are
also
in
some
sense
one
laws
compare
protagoras
so
various
and
if
regarded
on
the
surface
only
inconsistent
are
the
statements
of
plato
respecting
the
doctrine
of
ideas
if
we
attempted
to
harmonize
or
to
combine
them
we
should
make
out
of
them
not
a
system
but
the
caricature
of
a
system
they
are
the
expression
of
plato
idealism
the
terms
used
in
them
are
in
their
substance
and
general
meaning
the
same
although
they
seem
to
be
different
they
pass
from
the
subject
to
the
object
from
earth
diesseits
to
heaven
jenseits
without
regard
to
the
gulf
which
later
theology
and
philosophy
have
made
between
them
they
are
also
intended
to
supplement
or
explain
each
other
they
relate
to
a
subject
of
which
plato
himself
would
have
said
that
was
not
confident
of
the
precise
form
of
his
own
statements
but
was
strong
in
the
belief
that
something
of
the
kind
was
true
it
is
the
spirit
not
the
letter
in
which
they
agree
the
spirit
which
places
the
divine
above
the
human
the
spiritual
above
the
material
the
one
above
the
many
the
mind
before
the
body
the
stream
of
ancient
philosophy
in
the
alexandrian
and
roman
times
widens
into
a
lake
or
sea
and
then
disappears
underground
to
reappear
after
many
ages
in
a
distant
land
it
begins
to
flow
again
under
new
conditions
at
first
confined
between
high
and
narrow
banks
but
finally
spreading
over
the
continent
of
europe
it
is
and
is
not
the
same
with
ancient
philosophy
there
is
a
great
deal
in
modern
philosophy
which
is
inspired
by
ancient
there
is
much
in
ancient
philosophy
which
was
out
of
due
time
and
before
men
were
capable
of
understanding
it
to
the
fathers
of
modern
philosophy
their
own
thoughts
appeared
to
be
new
and
original
but
they
carried
with
them
an
echo
or
shadow
of
the
past
coming
back
by
recollection
from
an
elder
world
of
this
the
enquirers
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
to
themselves
appeared
to
be
working
out
independently
the
enquiry
into
all
truth
were
unconscious
they
stood
in
a
new
relation
to
theology
and
natural
philosophy
and
for
a
time
maintained
towards
both
an
attitude
of
reserve
and
separation
yet
the
similarities
between
modern
and
ancient
thought
are
greater
far
than
the
differences
all
philosophy
even
that
part
of
it
which
is
said
to
be
based
upon
experience
is
really
ideal
and
ideas
are
not
only
derived
from
facts
but
they
are
also
prior
to
them
and
extend
far
beyond
them
just
as
the
mind
is
prior
to
the
senses
early
greek
speculation
culminates
in
the
ideas
of
plato
or
rather
in
the
single
idea
of
good
his
followers
and
perhaps
he
himself
having
arrived
at
this
elevation
instead
of
going
forwards
went
backwards
from
philosophy
to
psychology
from
ideas
to
numbers
but
what
we
perceive
to
be
the
real
meaning
of
them
an
explanation
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
knowledge
will
always
continue
to
be
one
of
the
first
problems
of
philosophy
plato
also
left
behind
him
a
most
potent
instrument
the
forms
of
logic
arms
ready
for
use
but
not
yet
taken
out
of
their
armoury
they
were
the
late
birth
of
the
early
greek
philosophy
and
were
the
only
part
of
it
which
has
had
an
uninterrupted
hold
on
the
mind
of
europe
philosophies
come
and
go
but
the
detection
of
fallacies
the
framing
of
definitions
the
invention
of
methods
still
continue
to
be
the
main
elements
of
the
reasoning
process
modern
philosophy
like
ancient
begins
with
very
simple
conceptions
it
is
almost
wholly
a
reflection
on
self
it
might
be
described
as
a
quickening
into
life
of
old
words
and
notions
latent
in
the
latin
and
putting
a
new
meaning
into
them
unlike
ancient
philosophy
it
has
been
unaffected
by
impressions
derived
from
outward
nature
it
arose
within
the
limits
of
the
mind
itself
from
the
time
of
descartes
to
hume
and
kant
it
has
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
facts
of
science
on
the
other
hand
the
ancient
and
mediaeval
logic
retained
a
continuous
influence
over
it
and
a
form
like
that
of
mathematics
was
easily
impressed
upon
it
the
principle
of
ancient
philosophy
which
is
most
apparent
in
it
is
scepticism
we
must
doubt
nearly
every
traditional
or
received
notion
that
we
may
hold
fast
one
or
two
the
being
of
god
in
a
personal
or
impersonal
form
was
a
mental
necessity
to
the
first
thinkers
of
modern
times
from
this
alone
all
other
ideas
could
be
deduced
there
had
been
an
obscure
presentiment
of
ergo
sum
more
than
years
previously
the
eleatic
notion
that
being
and
thought
were
the
same
was
revived
in
a
new
form
by
descartes
but
now
it
gave
birth
to
consciousness
and
it
awakened
the
in
human
nature
the
mind
naked
and
abstract
has
no
other
certainty
but
the
conviction
of
its
own
existence
think
therefore
i
am
and
this
thought
is
god
thinking
in
me
who
has
also
communicated
to
the
reason
of
man
his
own
attributes
of
thought
and
extension
these
are
truly
imparted
to
him
because
god
is
true
compare
republic
it
has
been
often
remarked
that
descartes
having
begun
by
dismissing
all
presuppositions
introduces
several
he
passes
almost
at
once
from
scepticism
to
dogmatism
it
is
more
important
for
the
illustration
of
plato
to
observe
that
he
like
plato
insists
that
god
is
true
and
incapable
of
deception
republic
that
he
proceeds
from
general
ideas
that
many
elements
of
mathematics
may
be
found
in
him
a
certain
influence
of
mathematics
both
on
the
form
and
substance
of
their
philosophy
is
discernible
in
both
of
them
after
making
the
greatest
opposition
between
thought
and
extension
descartes
like
plato
supposes
them
to
be
reunited
for
a
time
not
in
their
own
nature
but
by
a
special
divine
act
compare
phaedrus
and
he
also
supposes
all
the
parts
of
the
human
body
to
meet
in
the
pineal
gland
that
alone
affording
a
principle
of
unity
in
the
material
frame
of
man
it
is
characteristic
of
the
first
period
of
modern
philosophy
that
having
begun
like
the
presocratics
with
a
few
general
notions
descartes
first
falls
absolutely
under
their
influence
and
then
quickly
discards
them
at
the
same
time
he
is
less
able
to
observe
facts
because
they
are
too
much
magnified
by
the
glasses
through
which
they
are
seen
the
common
logic
says
greater
the
extension
the
less
the
comprehension
and
we
may
put
the
same
thought
in
another
way
and
say
of
abstract
or
general
ideas
that
the
greater
the
abstraction
of
them
the
less
are
they
capable
of
being
applied
to
particular
and
concrete
natures
not
very
different
from
descartes
in
his
relation
to
ancient
philosophy
is
his
successor
spinoza
who
lived
in
the
following
generation
the
system
of
spinoza
is
less
personal
and
also
less
dualistic
than
that
of
descartes
in
this
respect
the
difference
between
them
is
like
that
between
xenophanes
and
parmenides
the
teaching
of
spinoza
might
be
described
generally
as
the
jewish
religion
reduced
to
an
abstraction
and
taking
the
form
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
like
parmenides
he
is
overpowered
and
intoxicated
with
the
idea
of
being
or
god
the
greatness
of
both
philosophies
consists
in
the
immensity
of
a
thought
which
excludes
all
other
thoughts
their
weakness
is
the
necessary
separation
of
this
thought
from
actual
existence
and
from
practical
life
in
neither
of
them
is
there
any
clear
opposition
between
the
inward
and
outward
world
the
substance
of
spinoza
has
two
attributes
which
alone
are
cognizable
by
man
thought
and
extension
these
are
in
extreme
opposition
to
one
another
and
also
in
inseparable
identity
they
may
be
regarded
as
the
two
aspects
or
expressions
under
which
god
or
substance
is
unfolded
to
man
here
a
step
is
made
beyond
the
limits
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
the
famous
theorem
of
spinoza
determinatio
est
negatio
is
already
contained
in
the
is
relation
of
sophist
the
grand
description
of
the
philosopher
in
republic
vi
as
the
spectator
of
all
time
and
all
existence
may
be
paralleled
with
another
famous
expression
of
spinoza
rerum
sub
specie
eternitatis
according
to
spinoza
finite
objects
are
unreal
for
they
are
conditioned
by
what
is
alien
to
them
and
by
one
another
human
beings
are
included
in
the
number
of
them
hence
there
is
no
reality
in
human
action
and
no
place
for
right
and
wrong
individuality
is
accident
the
boasted
freedom
of
the
will
is
only
a
consciousness
of
necessity
truth
he
says
is
the
direction
of
the
reason
towards
the
infinite
in
which
all
things
repose
and
herein
lies
the
secret
of
man
in
the
exaltation
of
the
reason
or
intellect
in
the
denial
of
the
voluntariness
of
evil
timaeus
laws
spinoza
approaches
nearer
to
plato
than
in
his
conception
of
an
infinite
substance
as
socrates
said
that
virtue
is
knowledge
so
spinoza
would
have
maintained
that
knowledge
alone
is
good
and
what
contributes
to
knowledge
useful
both
are
equally
far
from
any
real
experience
or
observation
of
nature
and
the
same
difficulty
is
found
in
both
when
we
seek
to
apply
their
ideas
to
life
and
practice
there
is
a
gulf
fixed
between
the
infinite
substance
and
finite
objects
or
individuals
of
spinoza
just
as
there
is
between
the
ideas
of
plato
and
the
world
of
sense
removed
from
spinoza
by
less
than
a
generation
is
the
philosopher
leibnitz
who
after
deepening
and
intensifying
the
opposition
between
mind
and
matter
reunites
them
by
his
preconcerted
harmony
compare
again
phaedrus
to
him
all
the
particles
of
matter
are
living
beings
which
reflect
on
one
another
and
in
the
least
of
them
the
whole
is
contained
here
we
catch
a
reminiscence
both
of
the
omoiomere
or
similar
particles
of
anaxagoras
and
of
the
of
the
timaeus
in
bacon
and
locke
we
have
another
development
in
which
the
mind
of
man
is
supposed
to
receive
knowledge
by
a
new
method
and
to
work
by
observation
and
experience
but
we
may
remark
that
it
is
the
idea
of
experience
rather
than
experience
itself
with
which
the
mind
is
filled
it
is
a
symbol
of
knowledge
rather
than
the
reality
which
is
vouchsafed
to
us
the
organon
of
bacon
is
not
much
nearer
to
actual
facts
than
the
organon
of
aristotle
or
the
platonic
idea
of
good
many
of
the
old
rags
and
ribbons
which
defaced
the
garment
of
philosophy
have
been
stripped
off
but
some
of
them
still
adhere
a
crude
conception
of
the
ideas
of
plato
survives
in
the
of
bacon
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
passages
of
plato
in
which
the
importance
of
the
investigation
of
facts
is
as
much
insisted
upon
as
by
bacon
both
are
almost
equally
superior
to
the
illusions
of
language
and
are
constantly
crying
out
against
them
as
against
other
idols
locke
can
not
be
truly
regarded
as
the
author
of
sensationalism
any
more
than
of
idealism
his
system
is
based
upon
experience
but
with
him
experience
includes
reflection
as
well
as
sense
his
analysis
and
construction
of
ideas
has
no
foundation
in
fact
it
is
only
the
dialectic
of
the
mind
to
herself
the
philosophy
of
berkeley
is
but
the
transposition
of
two
words
for
objects
of
sense
he
would
substitute
sensations
he
imagines
himself
to
have
changed
the
relation
of
the
human
mind
towards
god
and
nature
they
remain
the
same
as
before
though
he
has
drawn
the
imaginary
line
by
which
they
are
divided
at
a
different
point
he
has
annihilated
the
outward
world
but
it
instantly
reappears
governed
by
the
same
laws
and
described
under
the
same
names
a
like
remark
applies
to
david
hume
of
whose
philosophy
the
central
principle
is
the
denial
of
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
he
would
deprive
men
of
a
familiar
term
which
they
can
ill
afford
to
lose
but
he
seems
not
to
have
observed
that
this
alteration
is
merely
verbal
and
does
not
in
any
degree
affect
the
nature
of
things
still
less
did
he
remark
that
he
was
arguing
from
the
necessary
imperfection
of
language
against
the
most
certain
facts
and
here
again
we
may
find
a
parallel
with
the
ancients
he
goes
beyond
facts
in
his
scepticism
as
they
did
in
their
idealism
like
the
ancient
sophists
he
relegates
the
more
important
principles
of
ethics
to
custom
and
probability
but
crude
and
unmeaning
as
this
philosophy
is
it
exercised
a
great
influence
on
his
successors
not
unlike
that
which
locke
exercised
upon
berkeley
and
berkeley
upon
hume
himself
all
three
were
both
sceptical
and
ideal
in
almost
equal
degrees
neither
they
nor
their
predecessors
had
any
true
conception
of
language
or
of
the
history
of
philosophy
paradox
has
been
forgotten
by
the
world
and
did
not
any
more
than
the
scepticism
of
the
ancients
require
to
be
seriously
refuted
like
some
other
philosophical
paradoxes
it
would
have
been
better
left
to
die
out
it
certainly
could
not
be
refuted
by
a
philosophy
such
as
kant
in
which
no
less
than
in
the
previously
mentioned
systems
the
history
of
the
human
mind
and
the
nature
of
language
are
almost
wholly
ignored
and
the
certainty
of
objective
knowledge
is
transferred
to
the
subject
while
absolute
truth
is
reduced
to
a
figment
more
abstract
and
narrow
than
plato
ideas
of
in
itself
to
which
if
we
reason
strictly
no
predicate
can
be
applied
the
question
which
plato
has
raised
respecting
the
origin
and
nature
of
ideas
belongs
to
the
infancy
of
philosophy
in
modern
times
it
would
no
longer
be
asked
their
origin
is
only
their
history
so
far
as
we
know
it
there
can
be
no
other
we
may
trace
them
in
language
in
philosophy
in
mythology
in
poetry
but
we
can
not
argue
a
priori
about
them
we
may
attempt
to
shake
them
off
but
they
are
always
returning
and
in
every
sphere
of
science
and
human
action
are
tending
to
go
beyond
facts
they
are
thought
to
be
innate
because
they
have
been
familiar
to
us
all
our
lives
and
we
can
no
longer
dismiss
them
from
our
mind
many
of
them
express
relations
of
terms
to
which
nothing
exactly
or
nothing
at
all
in
rerum
natura
corresponds
we
are
not
such
free
agents
in
the
use
of
them
as
we
sometimes
imagine
fixed
ideas
have
taken
the
most
complete
possession
of
some
thinkers
who
have
been
most
determined
to
renounce
them
and
have
been
vehemently
affirmed
when
they
could
be
least
explained
and
were
incapable
of
proof
the
world
has
often
been
led
away
by
a
word
to
which
no
distinct
meaning
could
be
attached
abstractions
such
as
and
a
heap
of
other
metaphysical
and
theological
terms
are
the
source
of
quite
as
much
error
and
illusion
and
have
as
little
relation
to
actual
facts
as
the
ideas
of
plato
few
students
of
theology
or
philosophy
have
sufficiently
reflected
how
quickly
the
bloom
of
a
philosophy
passes
away
or
how
hard
it
is
for
one
age
to
understand
the
writings
of
another
or
how
nice
a
judgment
is
required
of
those
who
are
seeking
to
express
the
philosophy
of
one
age
in
the
terms
of
another
the
truths
of
which
metaphysicians
speak
have
hardly
ever
lasted
more
than
a
generation
in
our
own
day
schools
or
systems
of
philosophy
which
have
once
been
famous
have
died
before
the
founders
of
them
we
are
still
as
in
plato
age
groping
about
for
a
new
method
more
comprehensive
than
any
of
those
which
now
prevail
and
also
more
permanent
and
we
seem
to
see
at
a
distance
the
promise
of
such
a
method
which
can
hardly
be
any
other
than
the
method
of
idealized
experience
having
roots
which
strike
far
down
into
the
history
of
philosophy
it
is
a
method
which
does
not
divorce
the
present
from
the
past
or
the
part
from
the
whole
or
the
abstract
from
the
concrete
or
theory
from
fact
or
the
divine
from
the
human
or
one
science
from
another
but
labours
to
connect
them
along
such
a
road
we
have
proceeded
a
few
steps
sufficient
perhaps
to
make
us
reflect
on
the
want
of
method
which
prevails
in
our
own
day
in
another
age
all
the
branches
of
knowledge
whether
relating
to
god
or
man
or
nature
will
become
the
knowledge
of
revelation
of
a
single
science
symp
and
all
things
like
the
stars
in
heaven
will
shed
their
light
upon
one
another
meno
persons
of
the
dialogue
meno
socrates
a
slave
of
meno
boy
anytus
meno
can
you
tell
me
socrates
whether
virtue
is
acquired
by
teaching
or
by
practice
or
if
neither
by
teaching
nor
by
practice
then
whether
it
comes
to
man
by
nature
or
in
what
other
way
socrates
o
meno
there
was
a
time
when
the
thessalians
were
famous
among
the
other
hellenes
only
for
their
riches
and
their
riding
but
now
if
i
am
not
mistaken
they
are
equally
famous
for
their
wisdom
especially
at
larisa
which
is
the
native
city
of
your
friend
aristippus
and
this
is
gorgias
doing
for
when
he
came
there
the
flower
of
the
aleuadae
among
them
your
admirer
aristippus
and
the
other
chiefs
of
the
thessalians
fell
in
love
with
his
wisdom
and
he
has
taught
you
the
habit
of
answering
questions
in
a
grand
and
bold
style
which
becomes
those
who
know
and
is
the
style
in
which
he
himself
answers
all
comers
and
any
hellene
who
likes
may
ask
him
anything
how
different
is
our
lot
my
dear
meno
here
at
athens
there
is
a
dearth
of
the
commodity
and
all
wisdom
seems
to
have
emigrated
from
us
to
you
i
am
certain
that
if
you
were
to
ask
any
athenian
whether
virtue
was
natural
or
acquired
he
would
laugh
in
your
face
and
say
you
have
far
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
if
you
think
that
i
can
answer
your
question
for
i
literally
do
not
know
what
virtue
is
and
much
less
whether
it
is
acquired
by
teaching
or
not
and
i
myself
meno
living
as
i
do
in
this
region
of
poverty
am
as
poor
as
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
confess
with
shame
that
i
know
literally
nothing
about
virtue
and
when
i
do
not
know
the
of
anything
how
can
i
know
the
how
if
i
knew
nothing
at
all
of
meno
could
i
tell
if
he
was
fair
or
the
opposite
of
fair
rich
and
noble
or
the
reverse
of
rich
and
noble
do
you
think
that
i
could
meno
no
indeed
but
are
you
in
earnest
socrates
in
saying
that
you
do
not
know
what
virtue
is
and
am
i
to
carry
back
this
report
of
you
to
thessaly
socrates
not
only
that
my
dear
boy
but
you
may
say
further
that
i
have
never
known
of
any
one
else
who
did
in
my
judgment
meno
then
you
have
never
met
gorgias
when
he
was
at
athens
socrates
yes
i
have
meno
and
did
you
not
think
that
he
knew
socrates
i
have
not
a
good
memory
meno
and
therefore
i
can
not
now
tell
what
i
thought
of
him
at
the
time
and
i
dare
say
that
he
did
know
and
that
you
know
what
he
said
please
therefore
to
remind
me
of
what
he
said
or
if
you
would
rather
tell
me
your
own
view
for
i
suspect
that
you
and
he
think
much
alike
meno
very
true
socrates
then
as
he
is
not
here
never
mind
him
and
do
you
tell
me
by
the
gods
meno
be
generous
and
tell
me
what
you
say
that
virtue
is
for
i
shall
be
truly
delighted
to
find
that
i
have
been
mistaken
and
that
you
and
gorgias
do
really
have
this
knowledge
although
i
have
been
just
saying
that
i
have
never
found
anybody
who
had
meno
there
will
be
no
difficulty
socrates
in
answering
your
question
let
us
take
first
the
virtue
of
a
man
he
should
know
how
to
administer
the
state
and
in
the
administration
of
it
to
benefit
his
friends
and
harm
his
enemies
and
he
must
also
be
careful
not
to
suffer
harm
himself
a
woman
virtue
if
you
wish
to
know
about
that
may
also
be
easily
described
her
duty
is
to
order
her
house
and
keep
what
is
indoors
and
obey
her
husband
every
age
every
condition
of
life
young
or
old
male
or
female
bond
or
free
has
a
different
virtue
there
are
virtues
numberless
and
no
lack
of
definitions
of
them
for
virtue
is
relative
to
the
actions
and
ages
of
each
of
us
in
all
that
we
do
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
vice
socrates
compare
arist
socrates
how
fortunate
i
am
meno
when
i
ask
you
for
one
virtue
you
present
me
with
a
swarm
of
them
compare
theaet
which
are
in
your
keeping
suppose
that
i
carry
on
the
figure
of
the
swarm
and
ask
of
you
what
is
the
nature
of
the
bee
and
you
answer
that
there
are
many
kinds
of
bees
and
i
reply
but
do
bees
differ
as
bees
because
there
are
many
and
different
kinds
of
them
or
are
they
not
rather
to
be
distinguished
by
some
other
quality
as
for
example
beauty
size
or
shape
how
would
you
answer
me
meno
i
should
answer
that
bees
do
not
differ
from
one
another
as
bees
socrates
and
if
i
went
on
to
say
that
is
what
i
desire
to
know
meno
tell
me
what
is
the
quality
in
which
they
do
not
differ
but
are
all
alike
would
you
be
able
to
answer
meno
i
should
socrates
and
so
of
the
virtues
however
many
and
different
they
may
be
they
have
all
a
common
nature
which
makes
them
virtues
and
on
this
he
who
would
answer
the
question
is
virtue
would
do
well
to
have
his
eye
fixed
do
you
understand
meno
i
am
beginning
to
understand
but
i
do
not
as
yet
take
hold
of
the
question
as
i
could
wish
socrates
when
you
say
meno
that
there
is
one
virtue
of
a
man
another
of
a
woman
another
of
a
child
and
so
on
does
this
apply
only
to
virtue
or
would
you
say
the
same
of
health
and
size
and
strength
or
is
the
nature
of
health
always
the
same
whether
in
man
or
woman
meno
i
should
say
that
health
is
the
same
both
in
man
and
woman
socrates
and
is
not
this
true
of
size
and
strength
if
a
woman
is
strong
she
will
be
strong
by
reason
of
the
same
form
and
of
the
same
strength
subsisting
in
her
which
there
is
in
the
man
i
mean
to
say
that
strength
as
strength
whether
of
man
or
woman
is
the
same
is
there
any
difference
meno
i
think
not
socrates
and
will
not
virtue
as
virtue
be
the
same
whether
in
a
child
or
in
a
person
in
a
woman
or
in
a
man
meno
i
can
not
help
feeling
socrates
that
this
case
is
different
from
the
others
socrates
but
why
were
you
not
saying
that
the
virtue
of
a
man
was
to
order
a
state
and
the
virtue
of
a
woman
was
to
order
a
house
meno
i
did
say
so
socrates
and
can
either
house
or
state
or
anything
be
well
ordered
without
temperance
and
without
justice
meno
certainly
not
socrates
then
they
who
order
a
state
or
a
house
temperately
or
justly
order
them
with
temperance
and
justice
meno
certainly
socrates
then
both
men
and
women
if
they
are
to
be
good
men
and
women
must
have
the
same
virtues
of
temperance
and
justice
meno
true
socrates
and
can
either
a
young
man
or
an
elder
one
be
good
if
they
are
intemperate
and
unjust
meno
they
can
not
socrates
they
must
be
temperate
and
just
meno
yes
socrates
then
all
men
are
good
in
the
same
way
and
by
participation
in
the
same
virtues
meno
such
is
the
inference
socrates
and
they
surely
would
not
have
been
good
in
the
same
way
unless
their
virtue
had
been
the
same
meno
they
would
not
socrates
then
now
that
the
sameness
of
all
virtue
has
been
proven
try
and
remember
what
you
and
gorgias
say
that
virtue
is
meno
will
you
have
one
definition
of
them
all
socrates
that
is
what
i
am
seeking
meno
if
you
want
to
have
one
definition
of
them
all
i
know
not
what
to
say
but
that
virtue
is
the
power
of
governing
mankind
socrates
and
does
this
definition
of
virtue
include
all
virtue
is
virtue
the
same
in
a
child
and
in
a
slave
meno
can
the
child
govern
his
father
or
the
slave
his
master
and
would
he
who
governed
be
any
longer
a
slave
meno
i
think
not
socrates
socrates
no
indeed
there
would
be
small
reason
in
that
yet
once
more
fair
friend
according
to
you
virtue
is
power
of
governing
but
do
you
not
add
and
not
unjustly
meno
yes
socrates
i
agree
there
for
justice
is
virtue
socrates
would
you
say
meno
or
virtue
meno
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
mean
as
i
might
say
about
anything
that
a
round
for
example
is
figure
and
not
simply
and
i
should
adopt
this
mode
of
speaking
because
there
are
other
figures
meno
quite
right
and
that
is
just
what
i
am
saying
about
virtue
that
there
are
other
virtues
as
well
as
justice
socrates
what
are
they
tell
me
the
names
of
them
as
i
would
tell
you
the
names
of
the
other
figures
if
you
asked
me
meno
courage
and
temperance
and
wisdom
and
magnanimity
are
virtues
and
there
are
many
others
socrates
yes
meno
and
again
we
are
in
the
same
case
in
searching
after
one
virtue
we
have
found
many
though
not
in
the
same
way
as
before
but
we
have
been
unable
to
find
the
common
virtue
which
runs
through
them
all
meno
why
socrates
even
now
i
am
not
able
to
follow
you
in
the
attempt
to
get
at
one
common
notion
of
virtue
as
of
other
things
socrates
no
wonder
but
i
will
try
to
get
nearer
if
i
can
for
you
know
that
all
things
have
a
common
notion
suppose
now
that
some
one
asked
you
the
question
which
i
asked
before
meno
he
would
say
what
is
figure
and
if
you
answered
he
would
reply
to
you
in
my
way
of
speaking
by
asking
whether
you
would
say
that
roundness
is
or
figure
and
you
would
answer
figure
meno
certainly
socrates
and
for
this
reason
that
there
are
other
figures
meno
yes
socrates
and
if
he
proceeded
to
ask
what
other
figures
are
there
you
would
have
told
him
meno
i
should
socrates
and
if
he
similarly
asked
what
colour
is
and
you
answered
whiteness
and
the
questioner
rejoined
would
you
say
that
whiteness
is
colour
or
a
colour
you
would
reply
a
colour
because
there
are
other
colours
as
well
meno
i
should
socrates
and
if
he
had
said
tell
me
what
they
are
you
would
have
told
him
of
other
colours
which
are
colours
just
as
much
as
whiteness
meno
yes
socrates
and
suppose
that
he
were
to
pursue
the
matter
in
my
way
he
would
say
ever
and
anon
we
are
landed
in
particulars
but
this
is
not
what
i
want
tell
me
then
since
you
call
them
by
a
common
name
and
say
that
they
are
all
figures
even
when
opposed
to
one
another
what
is
that
common
nature
which
you
designate
as
figure
which
contains
straight
as
well
as
round
and
is
no
more
one
than
the
other
that
would
be
your
mode
of
speaking
meno
yes
socrates
and
in
speaking
thus
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
round
is
round
any
more
than
straight
or
the
straight
any
more
straight
than
round
meno
certainly
not
socrates
you
only
assert
that
the
round
figure
is
not
more
a
figure
than
the
straight
or
the
straight
than
the
round
meno
very
true
socrates
to
what
then
do
we
give
the
name
of
figure
try
and
answer
suppose
that
when
a
person
asked
you
this
question
either
about
figure
or
colour
you
were
to
reply
man
i
do
not
understand
what
you
want
or
know
what
you
are
saying
he
would
look
rather
astonished
and
say
do
you
not
understand
that
i
am
looking
for
the
in
multis
and
then
he
might
put
the
question
in
another
form
meno
he
might
say
what
is
that
in
multis
which
you
call
figure
and
which
includes
not
only
round
and
straight
figures
but
all
could
you
not
answer
that
question
meno
i
wish
that
you
would
try
the
attempt
will
be
good
practice
with
a
view
to
the
answer
about
virtue
meno
i
would
rather
that
you
should
answer
socrates
socrates
shall
i
indulge
you
meno
by
all
means
socrates
and
then
you
will
tell
me
about
virtue
meno
i
will
socrates
then
i
must
do
my
best
for
there
is
a
prize
to
be
won
meno
certainly
socrates
well
i
will
try
and
explain
to
you
what
figure
is
what
do
you
say
to
this
answer
figure
is
the
only
thing
which
always
follows
colour
will
you
be
satisfied
with
it
as
i
am
sure
that
i
should
be
if
you
would
let
me
have
a
similar
definition
of
virtue
meno
but
socrates
it
is
such
a
simple
answer
socrates
why
simple
meno
because
according
to
you
figure
is
that
which
always
follows
colour
socrates
granted
meno
but
if
a
person
were
to
say
that
he
does
not
know
what
colour
is
any
more
than
what
figure
is
what
sort
of
answer
would
you
have
given
him
socrates
i
should
have
told
him
the
truth
and
if
he
were
a
philosopher
of
the
eristic
and
antagonistic
sort
i
should
say
to
him
you
have
my
answer
and
if
i
am
wrong
your
business
is
to
take
up
the
argument
and
refute
me
but
if
we
were
friends
and
were
talking
as
you
and
i
are
now
i
should
reply
in
a
milder
strain
and
more
in
the
vein
that
is
to
say
i
should
not
only
speak
the
truth
but
i
should
make
use
of
premises
which
the
person
interrogated
would
be
willing
to
admit
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
i
shall
endeavour
to
approach
you
you
will
acknowledge
will
you
not
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
end
or
termination
or
extremity
all
which
words
i
use
in
the
same
sense
although
i
am
aware
that
prodicus
might
draw
distinctions
about
them
but
still
you
i
am
sure
would
speak
of
a
thing
as
ended
or
terminated
that
is
all
which
i
am
saying
not
anything
very
difficult
meno
yes
i
should
and
i
believe
that
i
understand
your
meaning
socrates
and
you
would
speak
of
a
surface
and
also
of
a
solid
as
for
example
in
geometry
meno
yes
socrates
well
then
you
are
now
in
a
condition
to
understand
my
definition
of
figure
i
define
figure
to
be
that
in
which
the
solid
ends
or
more
concisely
the
limit
of
solid
meno
and
now
socrates
what
is
colour
socrates
you
are
outrageous
meno
in
thus
plaguing
a
poor
old
man
to
give
you
an
answer
when
you
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
remembering
what
is
gorgias
definition
of
virtue
meno
when
you
have
told
me
what
i
ask
i
will
tell
you
socrates
socrates
a
man
who
was
blindfolded
has
only
to
hear
you
talking
and
he
would
know
that
you
are
a
fair
creature
and
have
still
many
lovers
meno
why
do
you
think
so
socrates
why
because
you
always
speak
in
imperatives
like
all
beauties
when
they
are
in
their
prime
you
are
tyrannical
and
also
as
i
suspect
you
have
found
out
that
i
have
weakness
for
the
fair
and
therefore
to
humour
you
i
must
answer
meno
please
do
socrates
would
you
like
me
to
answer
you
after
the
manner
of
gorgias
which
is
familiar
to
you
meno
i
should
like
nothing
better
socrates
do
not
he
and
you
and
empedocles
say
that
there
are
certain
effluences
of
existence
meno
certainly
socrates
and
passages
into
which
and
through
which
the
effluences
pass
meno
exactly
socrates
and
some
of
the
effluences
fit
into
the
passages
and
some
of
them
are
too
small
or
too
large
meno
true
socrates
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
sight
meno
yes
socrates
and
now
as
pindar
says
my
meaning
colour
is
an
effluence
of
form
commensurate
with
sight
and
palpable
to
sense
meno
that
socrates
appears
to
me
to
be
an
admirable
answer
socrates
why
yes
because
it
happens
to
be
one
which
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
hearing
and
your
wit
will
have
discovered
i
suspect
that
you
may
explain
in
the
same
way
the
nature
of
sound
and
smell
and
of
many
other
similar
phenomena
meno
quite
true
socrates
the
answer
meno
was
in
the
orthodox
solemn
vein
and
therefore
was
more
acceptable
to
you
than
the
other
answer
about
figure
meno
yes
socrates
and
yet
o
son
of
alexidemus
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
other
was
the
better
and
i
am
sure
that
you
would
be
of
the
same
opinion
if
you
would
only
stay
and
be
initiated
and
were
not
compelled
as
you
said
yesterday
to
go
away
before
the
mysteries
meno
but
i
will
stay
socrates
if
you
will
give
me
many
such
answers
socrates
well
then
for
my
own
sake
as
well
as
for
yours
i
will
do
my
very
best
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
give
you
very
many
as
good
and
now
in
your
turn
you
are
to
fulfil
your
promise
and
tell
me
what
virtue
is
in
the
universal
and
do
not
make
a
singular
into
a
plural
as
the
facetious
say
of
those
who
break
a
thing
but
deliver
virtue
to
me
whole
and
sound
and
not
broken
into
a
number
of
pieces
i
have
given
you
the
pattern
meno
well
then
socrates
virtue
as
i
take
it
is
when
he
who
desires
the
honourable
is
able
to
provide
it
for
himself
so
the
poet
says
and
i
say
too
is
the
desire
of
things
honourable
and
the
power
of
attaining
them
socrates
and
does
he
who
desires
the
honourable
also
desire
the
good
meno
certainly
socrates
then
are
there
some
who
desire
the
evil
and
others
who
desire
the
good
do
not
all
men
my
dear
sir
desire
good
meno
i
think
not
socrates
there
are
some
who
desire
evil
meno
yes
socrates
do
you
mean
that
they
think
the
evils
which
they
desire
to
be
good
or
do
they
know
that
they
are
evil
and
yet
desire
them
meno
both
i
think
socrates
and
do
you
really
imagine
meno
that
a
man
knows
evils
to
be
evils
and
desires
them
notwithstanding
meno
certainly
i
do
socrates
and
desire
is
of
possession
meno
yes
of
possession
socrates
and
does
he
think
that
the
evils
will
do
good
to
him
who
possesses
them
or
does
he
know
that
they
will
do
him
harm
meno
there
are
some
who
think
that
the
evils
will
do
them
good
and
others
who
know
that
they
will
do
them
harm
socrates
and
in
your
opinion
do
those
who
think
that
they
will
do
them
good
know
that
they
are
evils
meno
certainly
not
socrates
is
it
not
obvious
that
those
who
are
ignorant
of
their
nature
do
not
desire
them
but
they
desire
what
they
suppose
to
be
goods
although
they
are
really
evils
and
if
they
are
mistaken
and
suppose
the
evils
to
be
goods
they
really
desire
goods
meno
yes
in
that
case
socrates
well
and
do
those
who
as
you
say
desire
evils
and
think
that
evils
are
hurtful
to
the
possessor
of
them
know
that
they
will
be
hurt
by
them
meno
they
must
know
it
socrates
and
must
they
not
suppose
that
those
who
are
hurt
are
miserable
in
proportion
to
the
hurt
which
is
inflicted
upon
them
meno
how
can
it
be
otherwise
socrates
but
are
not
the
miserable
meno
yes
indeed
socrates
and
does
any
one
desire
to
be
miserable
and
meno
i
should
say
not
socrates
socrates
but
if
there
is
no
one
who
desires
to
be
miserable
there
is
no
one
meno
who
desires
evil
for
what
is
misery
but
the
desire
and
possession
of
evil
meno
that
appears
to
be
the
truth
socrates
and
i
admit
that
nobody
desires
evil
socrates
and
yet
were
you
not
saying
just
now
that
virtue
is
the
desire
and
power
of
attaining
good
meno
yes
i
did
say
so
socrates
but
if
this
be
affirmed
then
the
desire
of
good
is
common
to
all
and
one
man
is
no
better
than
another
in
that
respect
meno
true
socrates
and
if
one
man
is
not
better
than
another
in
desiring
good
he
must
be
better
in
the
power
of
attaining
it
meno
exactly
socrates
then
according
to
your
definition
virtue
would
appear
to
be
the
power
of
attaining
good
meno
i
entirely
approve
socrates
of
the
manner
in
which
you
now
view
this
matter
socrates
then
let
us
see
whether
what
you
say
is
true
from
another
point
of
view
for
very
likely
you
may
be
right
you
affirm
virtue
to
be
the
power
of
attaining
goods
meno
yes
socrates
and
the
goods
which
you
mean
are
such
as
health
and
wealth
and
the
possession
of
gold
and
silver
and
having
office
and
honour
in
the
state
those
are
what
you
would
call
goods
meno
yes
i
should
include
all
those
socrates
then
according
to
meno
who
is
the
hereditary
friend
of
the
great
king
virtue
is
the
power
of
getting
silver
and
gold
and
would
you
add
that
they
must
be
gained
piously
justly
or
do
you
deem
this
to
be
of
no
consequence
and
is
any
mode
of
acquisition
even
if
unjust
and
dishonest
equally
to
be
deemed
virtue
meno
not
virtue
socrates
but
vice
socrates
then
justice
or
temperance
or
holiness
or
some
other
part
of
virtue
as
would
appear
must
accompany
the
acquisition
and
without
them
the
mere
acquisition
of
good
will
not
be
virtue
meno
why
how
can
there
be
virtue
without
these
socrates
and
the
of
gold
and
silver
in
a
dishonest
manner
for
oneself
or
another
or
in
other
words
the
want
of
them
may
be
equally
virtue
meno
true
socrates
then
the
acquisition
of
such
goods
is
no
more
virtue
than
the
and
want
of
them
but
whatever
is
accompanied
by
justice
or
honesty
is
virtue
and
whatever
is
devoid
of
justice
is
vice
meno
it
can
not
be
otherwise
in
my
judgment
socrates
and
were
we
not
saying
just
now
that
justice
temperance
and
the
like
were
each
of
them
a
part
of
virtue
meno
yes
socrates
and
so
meno
this
is
the
way
in
which
you
mock
me
meno
why
do
you
say
that
socrates
socrates
why
because
i
asked
you
to
deliver
virtue
into
my
hands
whole
and
unbroken
and
i
gave
you
a
pattern
according
to
which
you
were
to
frame
your
answer
and
you
have
forgotten
already
and
tell
me
that
virtue
is
the
power
of
attaining
good
justly
or
with
justice
and
justice
you
acknowledge
to
be
a
part
of
virtue
meno
yes
socrates
then
it
follows
from
your
own
admissions
that
virtue
is
doing
what
you
do
with
a
part
of
virtue
for
justice
and
the
like
are
said
by
you
to
be
parts
of
virtue
meno
what
of
that
socrates
what
of
that
why
did
not
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
the
nature
of
virtue
as
a
whole
and
you
are
very
far
from
telling
me
this
but
declare
every
action
to
be
virtue
which
is
done
with
a
part
of
virtue
as
though
you
had
told
me
and
i
must
already
know
the
whole
of
virtue
and
this
too
when
frittered
away
into
little
pieces
and
therefore
my
dear
meno
i
fear
that
i
must
begin
again
and
repeat
the
same
question
what
is
virtue
for
otherwise
i
can
only
say
that
every
action
done
with
a
part
of
virtue
is
virtue
what
else
is
the
meaning
of
saying
that
every
action
done
with
justice
is
virtue
ought
i
not
to
ask
the
question
over
again
for
can
any
one
who
does
not
know
virtue
know
a
part
of
virtue
meno
no
i
do
not
say
that
he
can
socrates
do
you
remember
how
in
the
example
of
figure
we
rejected
any
answer
given
in
terms
which
were
as
yet
unexplained
or
unadmitted
meno
yes
socrates
and
we
were
quite
right
in
doing
so
socrates
but
then
my
friend
do
not
suppose
that
we
can
explain
to
any
one
the
nature
of
virtue
as
a
whole
through
some
unexplained
portion
of
virtue
or
anything
at
all
in
that
fashion
we
should
only
have
to
ask
over
again
the
old
question
what
is
virtue
am
i
not
right
meno
i
believe
that
you
are
socrates
then
begin
again
and
answer
me
what
according
to
you
and
your
friend
gorgias
is
the
definition
of
virtue
meno
o
socrates
i
used
to
be
told
before
i
knew
you
that
you
were
always
doubting
yourself
and
making
others
doubt
and
now
you
are
casting
your
spells
over
me
and
i
am
simply
getting
bewitched
and
enchanted
and
am
at
my
wits
end
and
if
i
may
venture
to
make
a
jest
upon
you
you
seem
to
me
both
in
your
appearance
and
in
your
power
over
others
to
be
very
like
the
flat
torpedo
fish
who
torpifies
those
who
come
near
him
and
touch
him
as
you
have
now
torpified
me
i
think
for
my
soul
and
my
tongue
are
really
torpid
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
you
and
though
i
have
been
delivered
of
an
infinite
variety
of
speeches
about
virtue
before
now
and
to
many
persons
and
very
good
ones
they
were
as
i
thought
at
this
moment
i
can
not
even
say
what
virtue
is
and
i
think
that
you
are
very
wise
in
not
voyaging
and
going
away
from
home
for
if
you
did
in
other
places
as
you
do
in
athens
you
would
be
cast
into
prison
as
a
magician
socrates
you
are
a
rogue
meno
and
had
all
but
caught
me
meno
what
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
can
tell
why
you
made
a
simile
about
me
meno
why
socrates
in
order
that
i
might
make
another
simile
about
you
for
i
know
that
all
pretty
young
gentlemen
like
to
have
pretty
similes
made
about
them
as
well
they
may
but
i
shall
not
return
the
compliment
as
to
my
being
a
torpedo
if
the
torpedo
is
torpid
as
well
as
the
cause
of
torpidity
in
others
then
indeed
i
am
a
torpedo
but
not
otherwise
for
i
perplex
others
not
because
i
am
clear
but
because
i
am
utterly
perplexed
myself
and
now
i
know
not
what
virtue
is
and
you
seem
to
be
in
the
same
case
although
you
did
once
perhaps
know
before
you
touched
me
however
i
have
no
objection
to
join
with
you
in
the
enquiry
meno
and
how
will
you
enquire
socrates
into
that
which
you
do
not
know
what
will
you
put
forth
as
the
subject
of
enquiry
and
if
you
find
what
you
want
how
will
you
ever
know
that
this
is
the
thing
which
you
did
not
know
socrates
i
know
meno
what
you
mean
but
just
see
what
a
tiresome
dispute
you
are
introducing
you
argue
that
a
man
can
not
enquire
either
about
that
which
he
knows
or
about
that
which
he
does
not
know
for
if
he
knows
he
has
no
need
to
enquire
and
if
not
he
can
not
for
he
does
not
know
the
very
subject
about
which
he
is
to
enquire
compare
aristot
post
meno
well
socrates
and
is
not
the
argument
sound
socrates
i
think
not
meno
why
not
socrates
i
will
tell
you
why
i
have
heard
from
certain
wise
men
and
women
who
spoke
of
things
divine
that
meno
what
did
they
say
socrates
they
spoke
of
a
glorious
truth
as
i
conceive
meno
what
was
it
and
who
were
they
socrates
some
of
them
were
priests
and
priestesses
who
had
studied
how
they
might
be
able
to
give
a
reason
of
their
profession
there
have
been
poets
also
who
spoke
of
these
things
by
inspiration
like
pindar
and
many
others
who
were
inspired
and
they
say
mark
now
and
see
whether
their
words
are
true
they
say
that
the
soul
of
man
is
immortal
and
at
one
time
has
an
end
which
is
termed
dying
and
at
another
time
is
born
again
but
is
never
destroyed
and
the
moral
is
that
a
man
ought
to
live
always
in
perfect
holiness
in
the
ninth
year
persephone
sends
the
souls
of
those
from
whom
she
has
received
the
penalty
of
ancient
crime
back
again
from
beneath
into
the
light
of
the
sun
above
and
these
are
they
who
become
noble
kings
and
mighty
men
and
great
in
wisdom
and
are
called
saintly
heroes
in
after
ages
the
soul
then
as
being
immortal
and
having
been
born
again
many
times
and
having
seen
all
things
that
exist
whether
in
this
world
or
in
the
world
below
has
knowledge
of
them
all
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
she
should
be
able
to
call
to
remembrance
all
that
she
ever
knew
about
virtue
and
about
everything
for
as
all
nature
is
akin
and
the
soul
has
learned
all
things
there
is
no
difficulty
in
her
eliciting
or
as
men
say
learning
out
of
a
single
recollection
all
the
rest
if
a
man
is
strenuous
and
does
not
faint
for
all
enquiry
and
all
learning
is
but
recollection
and
therefore
we
ought
not
to
listen
to
this
sophistical
argument
about
the
impossibility
of
enquiry
for
it
will
make
us
idle
and
is
sweet
only
to
the
sluggard
but
the
other
saying
will
make
us
active
and
inquisitive
in
that
confiding
i
will
gladly
enquire
with
you
into
the
nature
of
virtue
meno
yes
socrates
but
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
we
do
not
learn
and
that
what
we
call
learning
is
only
a
process
of
recollection
can
you
teach
me
how
this
is
socrates
i
told
you
meno
just
now
that
you
were
a
rogue
and
now
you
ask
whether
i
can
teach
you
when
i
am
saying
that
there
is
no
teaching
but
only
recollection
and
thus
you
imagine
that
you
will
involve
me
in
a
contradiction
meno
indeed
socrates
i
protest
that
i
had
no
such
intention
i
only
asked
the
question
from
habit
but
if
you
can
prove
to
me
that
what
you
say
is
true
i
wish
that
you
would
socrates
it
will
be
no
easy
matter
but
i
will
try
to
please
you
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
suppose
that
you
call
one
of
your
numerous
attendants
that
i
may
demonstrate
on
him
meno
certainly
come
hither
boy
socrates
he
is
greek
and
speaks
greek
does
he
not
meno
yes
indeed
he
was
born
in
the
house
socrates
attend
now
to
the
questions
which
i
ask
him
and
observe
whether
he
learns
of
me
or
only
remembers
meno
i
will
socrates
tell
me
boy
do
you
know
that
a
figure
like
this
is
a
square
boy
i
do
socrates
and
you
know
that
a
square
figure
has
these
four
lines
equal
boy
certainly
socrates
and
these
lines
which
i
have
drawn
through
the
middle
of
the
square
are
also
equal
boy
yes
socrates
a
square
may
be
of
any
size
boy
certainly
socrates
and
if
one
side
of
the
figure
be
of
two
feet
and
the
other
side
be
of
two
feet
how
much
will
the
whole
be
let
me
explain
if
in
one
direction
the
space
was
of
two
feet
and
in
the
other
direction
of
one
foot
the
whole
would
be
of
two
feet
taken
once
boy
yes
socrates
but
since
this
side
is
also
of
two
feet
there
are
twice
two
feet
boy
there
are
socrates
then
the
square
is
of
twice
two
feet
boy
yes
socrates
and
how
many
are
twice
two
feet
count
and
tell
me
boy
four
socrates
socrates
and
might
there
not
be
another
square
twice
as
large
as
this
and
having
like
this
the
lines
equal
boy
yes
socrates
and
of
how
many
feet
will
that
be
boy
of
eight
feet
socrates
and
now
try
and
tell
me
the
length
of
the
line
which
forms
the
side
of
that
double
square
this
is
two
feet
what
will
that
be
boy
clearly
socrates
it
will
be
double
socrates
do
you
observe
meno
that
i
am
not
teaching
the
boy
anything
but
only
asking
him
questions
and
now
he
fancies
that
he
knows
how
long
a
line
is
necessary
in
order
to
produce
a
figure
of
eight
square
feet
does
he
not
meno
yes
socrates
and
does
he
really
know
meno
certainly
not
socrates
he
only
guesses
that
because
the
square
is
double
the
line
is
double
meno
true
socrates
observe
him
while
he
recalls
the
steps
in
regular
order
to
the
boy
tell
me
boy
do
you
assert
that
a
double
space
comes
from
a
double
line
remember
that
i
am
not
speaking
of
an
oblong
but
of
a
figure
equal
every
way
and
twice
the
size
of
this
that
is
to
say
of
eight
feet
and
i
want
to
know
whether
you
still
say
that
a
double
square
comes
from
double
line
boy
yes
socrates
but
does
not
this
line
become
doubled
if
we
add
another
such
line
here
boy
certainly
socrates
and
four
such
lines
will
make
a
space
containing
eight
feet
boy
yes
socrates
let
us
describe
such
a
figure
would
you
not
say
that
this
is
the
figure
of
eight
feet
boy
yes
socrates
and
are
there
not
these
four
divisions
in
the
figure
each
of
which
is
equal
to
the
figure
of
four
feet
boy
true
socrates
and
is
not
that
four
times
four
boy
certainly
socrates
and
four
times
is
not
double
boy
no
indeed
socrates
but
how
much
boy
four
times
as
much
socrates
therefore
the
double
line
boy
has
given
a
space
not
twice
but
four
times
as
much
boy
true
socrates
four
times
four
are
sixteen
are
they
not
boy
yes
socrates
what
line
would
give
you
a
space
of
eight
feet
as
this
gives
one
of
sixteen
feet
do
you
see
boy
yes
socrates
and
the
space
of
four
feet
is
made
from
this
half
line
boy
yes
socrates
good
and
is
not
a
space
of
eight
feet
twice
the
size
of
this
and
half
the
size
of
the
other
boy
certainly
socrates
such
a
space
then
will
be
made
out
of
a
line
greater
than
this
one
and
less
than
that
one
boy
yes
i
think
so
socrates
very
good
i
like
to
hear
you
say
what
you
think
and
now
tell
me
is
not
this
a
line
of
two
feet
and
that
of
four
boy
yes
socrates
then
the
line
which
forms
the
side
of
eight
feet
ought
to
be
more
than
this
line
of
two
feet
and
less
than
the
other
of
four
feet
boy
it
ought
socrates
try
and
see
if
you
can
tell
me
how
much
it
will
be
boy
three
feet
socrates
then
if
we
add
a
half
to
this
line
of
two
that
will
be
the
line
of
three
here
are
two
and
there
is
one
and
on
the
other
side
here
are
two
also
and
there
is
one
and
that
makes
the
figure
of
which
you
speak
boy
yes
socrates
but
if
there
are
three
feet
this
way
and
three
feet
that
way
the
whole
space
will
be
three
times
three
feet
boy
that
is
evident
socrates
and
how
much
are
three
times
three
feet
boy
nine
socrates
and
how
much
is
the
double
of
four
boy
eight
socrates
then
the
figure
of
eight
is
not
made
out
of
a
line
of
three
boy
no
socrates
but
from
what
line
tell
me
exactly
and
if
you
would
rather
not
reckon
try
and
show
me
the
line
boy
indeed
socrates
i
do
not
know
socrates
do
you
see
meno
what
advances
he
has
made
in
his
power
of
recollection
he
did
not
know
at
first
and
he
does
not
know
now
what
is
the
side
of
a
figure
of
eight
feet
but
then
he
thought
that
he
knew
and
answered
confidently
as
if
he
knew
and
had
no
difficulty
now
he
has
a
difficulty
and
neither
knows
nor
fancies
that
he
knows
meno
true
socrates
is
he
not
better
off
in
knowing
his
ignorance
meno
i
think
that
he
is
socrates
if
we
have
made
him
doubt
and
given
him
the
shock
have
we
done
him
any
harm
meno
i
think
not
socrates
we
have
certainly
as
would
seem
assisted
him
in
some
degree
to
the
discovery
of
the
truth
and
now
he
will
wish
to
remedy
his
ignorance
but
then
he
would
have
been
ready
to
tell
all
the
world
again
and
again
that
the
double
space
should
have
a
double
side
meno
true
socrates
but
do
you
suppose
that
he
would
ever
have
enquired
into
or
learned
what
he
fancied
that
he
knew
though
he
was
really
ignorant
of
it
until
he
had
fallen
into
perplexity
under
the
idea
that
he
did
not
know
and
had
desired
to
know
meno
i
think
not
socrates
socrates
then
he
was
the
better
for
the
torpedo
touch
meno
i
think
so
socrates
mark
now
the
farther
development
i
shall
only
ask
him
and
not
teach
him
and
he
shall
share
the
enquiry
with
me
and
do
you
watch
and
see
if
you
find
me
telling
or
explaining
anything
to
him
instead
of
eliciting
his
opinion
tell
me
boy
is
not
this
a
square
of
four
feet
which
i
have
drawn
boy
yes
socrates
and
now
i
add
another
square
equal
to
the
former
one
boy
yes
socrates
and
a
third
which
is
equal
to
either
of
them
boy
yes
socrates
suppose
that
we
fill
up
the
vacant
corner
boy
very
good
socrates
here
then
there
are
four
equal
spaces
boy
yes
socrates
and
how
many
times
larger
is
this
space
than
this
other
boy
four
times
socrates
but
it
ought
to
have
been
twice
only
as
you
will
remember
boy
true
socrates
and
does
not
this
line
reaching
from
corner
to
corner
bisect
each
of
these
spaces
boy
yes
socrates
and
are
there
not
here
four
equal
lines
which
contain
this
space
boy
there
are
socrates
look
and
see
how
much
this
space
is
boy
i
do
not
understand
socrates
has
not
each
interior
line
cut
off
half
of
the
four
spaces
boy
yes
socrates
and
how
many
spaces
are
there
in
this
section
boy
four
socrates
and
how
many
in
this
boy
two
socrates
and
four
is
how
many
times
two
boy
twice
socrates
and
this
space
is
of
how
many
feet
boy
of
eight
feet
socrates
and
from
what
line
do
you
get
this
figure
boy
from
this
socrates
that
is
from
the
line
which
extends
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
figure
of
four
feet
boy
yes
socrates
and
that
is
the
line
which
the
learned
call
the
diagonal
and
if
this
is
the
proper
name
then
you
meno
slave
are
prepared
to
affirm
that
the
double
space
is
the
square
of
the
diagonal
boy
certainly
socrates
socrates
what
do
you
say
of
him
meno
were
not
all
these
answers
given
out
of
his
own
head
meno
yes
they
were
all
his
own
socrates
and
yet
as
we
were
just
now
saying
he
did
not
know
meno
true
socrates
but
still
he
had
in
him
those
notions
of
his
had
he
not
meno
yes
socrates
then
he
who
does
not
know
may
still
have
true
notions
of
that
which
he
does
not
know
meno
he
has
socrates
and
at
present
these
notions
have
just
been
stirred
up
in
him
as
in
a
dream
but
if
he
were
frequently
asked
the
same
questions
in
different
forms
he
would
know
as
well
as
any
one
at
last
meno
i
dare
say
socrates
without
any
one
teaching
him
he
will
recover
his
knowledge
for
himself
if
he
is
only
asked
questions
meno
yes
socrates
and
this
spontaneous
recovery
of
knowledge
in
him
is
recollection
meno
true
socrates
and
this
knowledge
which
he
now
has
must
he
not
either
have
acquired
or
always
possessed
meno
yes
socrates
but
if
he
always
possessed
this
knowledge
he
would
always
have
known
or
if
he
has
acquired
the
knowledge
he
could
not
have
acquired
it
in
this
life
unless
he
has
been
taught
geometry
for
he
may
be
made
to
do
the
same
with
all
geometry
and
every
other
branch
of
knowledge
now
has
any
one
ever
taught
him
all
this
you
must
know
about
him
if
as
you
say
he
was
born
and
bred
in
your
house
meno
and
i
am
certain
that
no
one
ever
did
teach
him
socrates
and
yet
he
has
the
knowledge
meno
the
fact
socrates
is
undeniable
socrates
but
if
he
did
not
acquire
the
knowledge
in
this
life
then
he
must
have
had
and
learned
it
at
some
other
time
meno
clearly
he
must
socrates
which
must
have
been
the
time
when
he
was
not
a
man
meno
yes
socrates
and
if
there
have
been
always
true
thoughts
in
him
both
at
the
time
when
he
was
and
was
not
a
man
which
only
need
to
be
awakened
into
knowledge
by
putting
questions
to
him
his
soul
must
have
always
possessed
this
knowledge
for
he
always
either
was
or
was
not
a
man
meno
obviously
socrates
and
if
the
truth
of
all
things
always
existed
in
the
soul
then
the
soul
is
immortal
wherefore
be
of
good
cheer
and
try
to
recollect
what
you
do
not
know
or
rather
what
you
do
not
remember
meno
i
feel
somehow
that
i
like
what
you
are
saying
socrates
and
i
meno
like
what
i
am
saying
some
things
i
have
said
of
which
i
am
not
altogether
confident
but
that
we
shall
be
better
and
braver
and
less
helpless
if
we
think
that
we
ought
to
enquire
than
we
should
have
been
if
we
indulged
in
the
idle
fancy
that
there
was
no
knowing
and
no
use
in
seeking
to
know
what
we
do
not
know
that
is
a
theme
upon
which
i
am
ready
to
fight
in
word
and
deed
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
meno
there
again
socrates
your
words
seem
to
me
excellent
socrates
then
as
we
are
agreed
that
a
man
should
enquire
about
that
which
he
does
not
know
shall
you
and
i
make
an
effort
to
enquire
together
into
the
nature
of
virtue
meno
by
all
means
socrates
and
yet
i
would
much
rather
return
to
my
original
question
whether
in
seeking
to
acquire
virtue
we
should
regard
it
as
a
thing
to
be
taught
or
as
a
gift
of
nature
or
as
coming
to
men
in
some
other
way
socrates
had
i
the
command
of
you
as
well
as
of
myself
meno
i
would
not
have
enquired
whether
virtue
is
given
by
instruction
or
not
until
we
had
first
ascertained
it
is
but
as
you
think
only
of
controlling
me
who
am
your
slave
and
never
of
controlling
yourself
such
being
your
notion
of
freedom
i
must
yield
to
you
for
you
are
irresistible
and
therefore
i
have
now
to
enquire
into
the
qualities
of
a
thing
of
which
i
do
not
as
yet
know
the
nature
at
any
rate
will
you
condescend
a
little
and
allow
the
question
virtue
is
given
by
instruction
or
in
any
other
way
to
be
argued
upon
hypothesis
as
the
geometrician
when
he
is
asked
whether
a
certain
triangle
is
capable
being
inscribed
in
a
certain
circle
or
whether
a
certain
area
is
capable
of
being
inscribed
as
a
triangle
in
a
certain
circle
will
reply
can
not
tell
you
as
yet
but
i
will
offer
a
hypothesis
which
may
assist
us
in
forming
a
conclusion
if
the
figure
be
such
that
when
you
have
produced
a
given
side
of
it
or
when
you
apply
it
to
the
given
line
the
diameter
of
the
circle
autou
the
given
area
of
the
triangle
falls
short
by
an
area
corresponding
to
the
part
produced
or
similar
to
the
area
so
applied
then
one
consequence
follows
and
if
this
is
impossible
then
some
other
and
therefore
i
wish
to
assume
a
hypothesis
before
i
tell
you
whether
this
triangle
is
capable
of
being
inscribed
in
the
circle
that
is
a
geometrical
hypothesis
and
we
too
as
we
know
not
the
nature
and
qualities
of
virtue
must
ask
whether
virtue
is
or
is
not
taught
under
a
hypothesis
as
thus
if
virtue
is
of
such
a
class
of
mental
goods
will
it
be
taught
or
not
let
the
first
hypothesis
be
that
virtue
is
or
is
not
knowledge
in
that
case
will
it
be
taught
or
not
or
as
we
were
just
now
saying
for
there
is
no
use
in
disputing
about
the
name
but
is
virtue
taught
or
not
or
rather
does
not
every
one
see
that
knowledge
alone
is
taught
meno
i
agree
socrates
then
if
virtue
is
knowledge
virtue
will
be
taught
meno
certainly
socrates
then
now
we
have
made
a
quick
end
of
this
question
if
virtue
is
of
such
a
nature
it
will
be
taught
and
if
not
not
meno
certainly
socrates
the
next
question
is
whether
virtue
is
knowledge
or
of
another
species
meno
yes
that
appears
to
be
the
question
which
comes
next
in
order
socrates
do
we
not
say
that
virtue
is
a
good
this
is
a
hypothesis
which
is
not
set
aside
meno
certainly
socrates
now
if
there
be
any
sort
of
good
which
is
distinct
from
knowledge
virtue
may
be
that
good
but
if
knowledge
embraces
all
good
then
we
shall
be
right
in
thinking
that
virtue
is
knowledge
meno
true
socrates
and
virtue
makes
us
good
meno
yes
socrates
and
if
we
are
good
then
we
are
profitable
for
all
good
things
are
profitable
meno
yes
socrates
then
virtue
is
profitable
meno
that
is
the
only
inference
socrates
then
now
let
us
see
what
are
the
things
which
severally
profit
us
health
and
strength
and
beauty
and
wealth
these
and
the
like
of
these
we
call
profitable
meno
true
socrates
and
yet
these
things
may
also
sometimes
do
us
harm
would
you
not
think
so
meno
yes
socrates
and
what
is
the
guiding
principle
which
makes
them
profitable
or
the
reverse
are
they
not
profitable
when
they
are
rightly
used
and
hurtful
when
they
are
not
rightly
used
meno
certainly
socrates
next
let
us
consider
the
goods
of
the
soul
they
are
temperance
justice
courage
quickness
of
apprehension
memory
magnanimity
and
the
like
meno
surely
socrates
and
such
of
these
as
are
not
knowledge
but
of
another
sort
are
sometimes
profitable
and
sometimes
hurtful
as
for
example
courage
wanting
prudence
which
is
only
a
sort
of
confidence
when
a
man
has
no
sense
he
is
harmed
by
courage
but
when
he
has
sense
he
is
profited
meno
true
socrates
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
temperance
and
quickness
of
apprehension
whatever
things
are
learned
or
done
with
sense
are
profitable
but
when
done
without
sense
they
are
hurtful
meno
very
true
socrates
and
in
general
all
that
the
soul
attempts
or
endures
when
under
the
guidance
of
wisdom
ends
in
happiness
but
when
she
is
under
the
guidance
of
folly
in
the
opposite
meno
that
appears
to
be
true
socrates
if
then
virtue
is
a
quality
of
the
soul
and
is
admitted
to
be
profitable
it
must
be
wisdom
or
prudence
since
none
of
the
things
of
the
soul
are
either
profitable
or
hurtful
in
themselves
but
they
are
all
made
profitable
or
hurtful
by
the
addition
of
wisdom
or
of
folly
and
therefore
if
virtue
is
profitable
virtue
must
be
a
sort
of
wisdom
or
prudence
meno
i
quite
agree
socrates
and
the
other
goods
such
as
wealth
and
the
like
of
which
we
were
just
now
saying
that
they
are
sometimes
good
and
sometimes
evil
do
not
they
also
become
profitable
or
hurtful
accordingly
as
the
soul
guides
and
uses
them
rightly
or
wrongly
just
as
the
things
of
the
soul
herself
are
benefited
when
under
the
guidance
of
wisdom
and
harmed
by
folly
meno
true
socrates
and
the
wise
soul
guides
them
rightly
and
the
foolish
soul
wrongly
meno
yes
socrates
and
is
not
this
universally
true
of
human
nature
all
other
things
hang
upon
the
soul
and
the
things
of
the
soul
herself
hang
upon
wisdom
if
they
are
to
be
good
and
so
wisdom
is
inferred
to
be
that
which
profits
and
virtue
as
we
say
is
profitable
meno
certainly
socrates
and
thus
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
virtue
is
either
wholly
or
partly
wisdom
meno
i
think
that
what
you
are
saying
socrates
is
very
true
socrates
but
if
this
is
true
then
the
good
are
not
by
nature
good
meno
i
think
not
socrates
if
they
had
been
there
would
assuredly
have
been
discerners
of
characters
among
us
who
would
have
known
our
future
great
men
and
on
their
showing
we
should
have
adopted
them
and
when
we
had
got
them
we
should
have
kept
them
in
the
citadel
out
of
the
way
of
harm
and
set
a
stamp
upon
them
far
rather
than
upon
a
piece
of
gold
in
order
that
no
one
might
tamper
with
them
and
when
they
grew
up
they
would
have
been
useful
to
the
state
meno
yes
socrates
that
would
have
been
the
right
way
socrates
but
if
the
good
are
not
by
nature
good
are
they
made
good
by
instruction
meno
there
appears
to
be
no
other
alternative
socrates
on
the
supposition
that
virtue
is
knowledge
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
virtue
is
taught
socrates
yes
indeed
but
what
if
the
supposition
is
erroneous
meno
i
certainly
thought
just
now
that
we
were
right
socrates
yes
meno
but
a
principle
which
has
any
soundness
should
stand
firm
not
only
just
now
but
always
meno
well
and
why
are
you
so
slow
of
heart
to
believe
that
knowledge
is
virtue
socrates
i
will
try
and
tell
you
why
meno
i
do
not
retract
the
assertion
that
if
virtue
is
knowledge
it
may
be
taught
but
i
fear
that
i
have
some
reason
in
doubting
whether
virtue
is
knowledge
for
consider
now
and
say
whether
virtue
and
not
only
virtue
but
anything
that
is
taught
must
not
have
teachers
and
disciples
meno
surely
socrates
and
conversely
may
not
the
art
of
which
neither
teachers
nor
disciples
exist
be
assumed
to
be
incapable
of
being
taught
meno
true
but
do
you
think
that
there
are
no
teachers
of
virtue
socrates
i
have
certainly
often
enquired
whether
there
were
any
and
taken
great
pains
to
find
them
and
have
never
succeeded
and
many
have
assisted
me
in
the
search
and
they
were
the
persons
whom
i
thought
the
most
likely
to
know
here
at
the
moment
when
he
is
wanted
we
fortunately
have
sitting
by
us
anytus
the
very
person
of
whom
we
should
make
enquiry
to
him
then
let
us
repair
in
the
first
place
he
is
the
son
of
a
wealthy
and
wise
father
anthemion
who
acquired
his
wealth
not
by
accident
or
gift
like
ismenias
the
theban
who
has
recently
made
himself
as
rich
as
polycrates
but
by
his
own
skill
and
industry
and
who
is
a
modest
man
not
insolent
or
overbearing
or
annoying
moreover
this
son
of
his
has
received
a
good
education
as
the
athenian
people
certainly
appear
to
think
for
they
choose
him
to
fill
the
highest
offices
and
these
are
the
sort
of
men
from
whom
you
are
likely
to
learn
whether
there
are
any
teachers
of
virtue
and
who
they
are
please
anytus
to
help
me
and
your
friend
meno
in
answering
our
question
who
are
the
teachers
consider
the
matter
thus
if
we
wanted
meno
to
be
a
good
physician
to
whom
should
we
send
him
should
we
not
send
him
to
the
physicians
anytus
certainly
socrates
or
if
we
wanted
him
to
be
a
good
cobbler
should
we
not
send
him
to
the
cobblers
anytus
yes
socrates
and
so
forth
anytus
yes
socrates
let
me
trouble
you
with
one
more
question
when
we
say
that
we
should
be
right
in
sending
him
to
the
physicians
if
we
wanted
him
to
be
a
physician
do
we
mean
that
we
should
be
right
in
sending
him
to
those
who
profess
the
art
rather
than
to
those
who
do
not
and
to
those
who
demand
payment
for
teaching
the
art
and
profess
to
teach
it
to
any
one
who
will
come
and
learn
and
if
these
were
our
reasons
should
we
not
be
right
in
sending
him
anytus
yes
socrates
and
might
not
the
same
be
said
of
and
of
the
other
arts
would
a
man
who
wanted
to
make
another
a
refuse
to
send
him
to
those
who
profess
to
teach
the
art
for
money
and
be
plaguing
other
persons
to
give
him
instruction
who
are
not
professed
teachers
and
who
never
had
a
single
disciple
in
that
branch
of
knowledge
which
he
wishes
him
to
acquire
would
not
such
conduct
be
the
height
of
folly
anytus
yes
by
zeus
and
of
ignorance
too
socrates
very
good
and
now
you
are
in
a
position
to
advise
with
me
about
my
friend
meno
he
has
been
telling
me
anytus
that
he
desires
to
attain
that
kind
of
wisdom
and
virtue
by
which
men
order
the
state
or
the
house
and
honour
their
parents
and
know
when
to
receive
and
when
to
send
away
citizens
and
strangers
as
a
good
man
should
now
to
whom
should
he
go
in
order
that
he
may
learn
this
virtue
does
not
the
previous
argument
imply
clearly
that
we
should
send
him
to
those
who
profess
and
avouch
that
they
are
the
common
teachers
of
all
hellas
and
are
ready
to
impart
instruction
to
any
one
who
likes
at
a
fixed
price
anytus
whom
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
you
surely
know
do
you
not
anytus
that
these
are
the
people
whom
mankind
call
sophists
anytus
by
heracles
socrates
forbear
i
only
hope
that
no
friend
or
kinsman
or
acquaintance
of
mine
whether
citizen
or
stranger
will
ever
be
so
mad
as
to
allow
himself
to
be
corrupted
by
them
for
they
are
a
manifest
pest
and
corrupting
influence
to
those
who
have
to
do
with
them
socrates
what
anytus
of
all
the
people
who
profess
that
they
know
how
to
do
men
good
do
you
mean
to
say
that
these
are
the
only
ones
who
not
only
do
them
no
good
but
positively
corrupt
those
who
are
entrusted
to
them
and
in
return
for
this
disservice
have
the
face
to
demand
money
indeed
i
can
not
believe
you
for
i
know
of
a
single
man
protagoras
who
made
more
out
of
his
craft
than
the
illustrious
pheidias
who
created
such
noble
works
or
any
ten
other
statuaries
how
could
that
be
a
mender
of
old
shoes
or
patcher
up
of
clothes
who
made
the
shoes
or
clothes
worse
than
he
received
them
could
not
have
remained
thirty
days
undetected
and
would
very
soon
have
starved
whereas
during
more
than
forty
years
protagoras
was
corrupting
all
hellas
and
sending
his
disciples
from
him
worse
than
he
received
them
and
he
was
never
found
out
for
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
was
about
seventy
years
old
at
his
death
forty
of
which
were
spent
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
and
during
all
that
time
he
had
a
good
reputation
which
to
this
day
he
retains
and
not
only
protagoras
but
many
others
are
well
spoken
of
some
who
lived
before
him
and
others
who
are
still
living
now
when
you
say
that
they
deceived
and
corrupted
the
youth
are
they
to
be
supposed
to
have
corrupted
them
consciously
or
unconsciously
can
those
who
were
deemed
by
many
to
be
the
wisest
men
of
hellas
have
been
out
of
their
minds
anytus
out
of
their
minds
no
socrates
the
young
men
who
gave
their
money
to
them
were
out
of
their
minds
and
their
relations
and
guardians
who
entrusted
their
youth
to
the
care
of
these
men
were
still
more
out
of
their
minds
and
most
of
all
the
cities
who
allowed
them
to
come
in
and
did
not
drive
them
out
citizen
and
stranger
alike
socrates
has
any
of
the
sophists
wronged
you
anytus
what
makes
you
so
angry
with
them
anytus
no
indeed
neither
i
nor
any
of
my
belongings
has
ever
had
nor
would
i
suffer
them
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
socrates
then
you
are
entirely
unacquainted
with
them
anytus
and
i
have
no
wish
to
be
acquainted
socrates
then
my
dear
friend
how
can
you
know
whether
a
thing
is
good
or
bad
of
which
you
are
wholly
ignorant
anytus
quite
well
i
am
sure
that
i
know
what
manner
of
men
these
are
whether
i
am
acquainted
with
them
or
not
socrates
you
must
be
a
diviner
anytus
for
i
really
can
not
make
out
judging
from
your
own
words
how
if
you
are
not
acquainted
with
them
you
know
about
them
but
i
am
not
enquiring
of
you
who
are
the
teachers
who
will
corrupt
meno
let
them
be
if
you
please
the
sophists
i
only
ask
you
to
tell
him
who
there
is
in
this
great
city
who
will
teach
him
how
to
become
eminent
in
the
virtues
which
i
was
just
now
describing
he
is
the
friend
of
your
family
and
you
will
oblige
him
anytus
why
do
you
not
tell
him
yourself
socrates
i
have
told
him
whom
i
supposed
to
be
the
teachers
of
these
things
but
i
learn
from
you
that
i
am
utterly
at
fault
and
i
dare
say
that
you
are
right
and
now
i
wish
that
you
on
your
part
would
tell
me
to
whom
among
the
athenians
he
should
go
whom
would
you
name
anytus
why
single
out
individuals
any
athenian
gentleman
taken
at
random
if
he
will
mind
him
will
do
far
more
good
to
him
than
the
sophists
socrates
and
did
those
gentlemen
grow
of
themselves
and
without
having
been
taught
by
any
one
were
they
nevertheless
able
to
teach
others
that
which
they
had
never
learned
themselves
anytus
i
imagine
that
they
learned
of
the
previous
generation
of
gentlemen
have
there
not
been
many
good
men
in
this
city
socrates
yes
certainly
anytus
and
many
good
statesmen
also
there
always
have
been
and
there
are
still
in
the
city
of
athens
but
the
question
is
whether
they
were
also
good
teachers
of
their
own
virtue
not
whether
there
are
or
have
been
good
men
in
this
part
of
the
world
but
whether
virtue
can
be
taught
is
the
question
which
we
have
been
discussing
now
do
we
mean
to
say
that
the
good
men
of
our
own
and
of
other
times
knew
how
to
impart
to
others
that
virtue
which
they
had
themselves
or
is
virtue
a
thing
incapable
of
being
communicated
or
imparted
by
one
man
to
another
that
is
the
question
which
i
and
meno
have
been
arguing
look
at
the
matter
in
your
own
way
would
you
not
admit
that
themistocles
was
a
good
man
anytus
certainly
no
man
better
socrates
and
must
not
he
then
have
been
a
good
teacher
if
any
man
ever
was
a
good
teacher
of
his
own
virtue
anytus
yes
certainly
if
he
wanted
to
be
so
socrates
but
would
he
not
have
wanted
he
would
at
any
rate
have
desired
to
make
his
own
son
a
good
man
and
a
gentleman
he
could
not
have
been
jealous
of
him
or
have
intentionally
abstained
from
imparting
to
him
his
own
virtue
did
you
never
hear
that
he
made
his
son
cleophantus
a
famous
horseman
and
had
him
taught
to
stand
upright
on
horseback
and
hurl
a
javelin
and
to
do
many
other
marvellous
things
and
in
anything
which
could
be
learned
from
a
master
he
was
well
trained
have
you
not
heard
from
our
elders
of
him
anytus
i
have
socrates
then
no
one
could
say
that
his
son
showed
any
want
of
capacity
anytus
very
likely
not
socrates
but
did
any
one
old
or
young
ever
say
in
your
hearing
that
cleophantus
son
of
themistocles
was
a
wise
or
good
man
as
his
father
was
anytus
i
have
certainly
never
heard
any
one
say
so
socrates
and
if
virtue
could
have
been
taught
would
his
father
themistocles
have
sought
to
train
him
in
these
minor
accomplishments
and
allowed
him
who
as
you
must
remember
was
his
own
son
to
be
no
better
than
his
neighbours
in
those
qualities
in
which
he
himself
excelled
anytus
indeed
indeed
i
think
not
socrates
here
was
a
teacher
of
virtue
whom
you
admit
to
be
among
the
best
men
of
the
past
let
us
take
another
aristides
the
son
of
lysimachus
would
you
not
acknowledge
that
he
was
a
good
man
anytus
to
be
sure
i
should
socrates
and
did
not
he
train
his
son
lysimachus
better
than
any
other
athenian
in
all
that
could
be
done
for
him
by
the
help
of
masters
but
what
has
been
the
result
is
he
a
bit
better
than
any
other
mortal
he
is
an
acquaintance
of
yours
and
you
see
what
he
is
like
there
is
pericles
again
magnificent
in
his
wisdom
and
he
as
you
are
aware
had
two
sons
paralus
and
xanthippus
anytus
i
know
socrates
and
you
know
also
that
he
taught
them
to
be
unrivalled
horsemen
and
had
them
trained
in
music
and
gymnastics
and
all
sorts
of
arts
in
these
respects
they
were
on
a
level
with
the
best
and
had
he
no
wish
to
make
good
men
of
them
nay
he
must
have
wished
it
but
virtue
as
i
suspect
could
not
be
taught
and
that
you
may
not
suppose
the
incompetent
teachers
to
be
only
the
meaner
sort
of
athenians
and
few
in
number
remember
again
that
thucydides
had
two
sons
melesias
and
stephanus
whom
besides
giving
them
a
good
education
in
other
things
he
trained
in
wrestling
and
they
were
the
best
wrestlers
in
athens
one
of
them
he
committed
to
the
care
of
xanthias
and
the
other
of
eudorus
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
celebrated
wrestlers
of
that
day
do
you
remember
them
anytus
i
have
heard
of
them
socrates
now
can
there
be
a
doubt
that
thucydides
whose
children
were
taught
things
for
which
he
had
to
spend
money
would
have
taught
them
to
be
good
men
which
would
have
cost
him
nothing
if
virtue
could
have
been
taught
will
you
reply
that
he
was
a
mean
man
and
had
not
many
friends
among
the
athenians
and
allies
nay
but
he
was
of
a
great
family
and
a
man
of
influence
at
athens
and
in
all
hellas
and
if
virtue
could
have
been
taught
he
would
have
found
out
some
athenian
or
foreigner
who
would
have
made
good
men
of
his
sons
if
he
could
not
himself
spare
the
time
from
cares
of
state
once
more
i
suspect
friend
anytus
that
virtue
is
not
a
thing
which
can
be
taught
anytus
socrates
i
think
that
you
are
too
ready
to
speak
evil
of
men
and
if
you
will
take
my
advice
i
would
recommend
you
to
be
careful
perhaps
there
is
no
city
in
which
it
is
not
easier
to
do
men
harm
than
to
do
them
good
and
this
is
certainly
the
case
at
athens
as
i
believe
that
you
know
socrates
o
meno
think
that
anytus
is
in
a
rage
and
he
may
well
be
in
a
rage
for
he
thinks
in
the
first
place
that
i
am
defaming
these
gentlemen
and
in
the
second
place
he
is
of
opinion
that
he
is
one
of
them
himself
but
some
day
he
will
know
what
is
the
meaning
of
defamation
and
if
he
ever
does
he
will
forgive
me
meanwhile
i
will
return
to
you
meno
for
i
suppose
that
there
are
gentlemen
in
your
region
too
meno
certainly
there
are
socrates
and
are
they
willing
to
teach
the
young
and
do
they
profess
to
be
teachers
and
do
they
agree
that
virtue
is
taught
meno
no
indeed
socrates
they
are
anything
but
agreed
you
may
hear
them
saying
at
one
time
that
virtue
can
be
taught
and
then
again
the
reverse
socrates
can
we
call
those
teachers
who
do
not
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
their
own
vocation
meno
i
think
not
socrates
socrates
and
what
do
you
think
of
these
sophists
who
are
the
only
professors
do
they
seem
to
you
to
be
teachers
of
virtue
meno
i
often
wonder
socrates
that
gorgias
is
never
heard
promising
to
teach
virtue
and
when
he
hears
others
promising
he
only
laughs
at
them
but
he
thinks
that
men
should
be
taught
to
speak
socrates
then
do
you
not
think
that
the
sophists
are
teachers
meno
i
can
not
tell
you
socrates
like
the
rest
of
the
world
i
am
in
doubt
and
sometimes
i
think
that
they
are
teachers
and
sometimes
not
socrates
and
are
you
aware
that
not
you
only
and
other
politicians
have
doubts
whether
virtue
can
be
taught
or
not
but
that
theognis
the
poet
says
the
very
same
thing
meno
where
does
he
say
so
socrates
in
these
elegiac
verses
theog
and
drink
and
sit
with
the
mighty
and
make
yourself
agreeable
to
them
for
from
the
good
you
will
learn
what
is
good
but
if
you
mix
with
the
bad
you
will
lose
the
intelligence
which
you
already
have
do
you
observe
that
here
he
seems
to
imply
that
virtue
can
be
taught
meno
clearly
socrates
but
in
some
other
verses
he
shifts
about
and
says
theog
understanding
could
be
created
and
put
into
a
man
then
they
who
were
able
to
perform
this
feat
have
obtained
great
rewards
and
again
would
a
bad
son
have
sprung
from
a
good
sire
for
he
would
have
heard
the
voice
of
instruction
but
not
by
teaching
will
you
ever
make
a
bad
man
into
a
good
one
and
this
as
you
may
remark
is
a
contradiction
of
the
other
meno
clearly
socrates
and
is
there
anything
else
of
which
the
professors
are
affirmed
not
only
not
to
be
teachers
of
others
but
to
be
ignorant
themselves
and
bad
at
the
knowledge
of
that
which
they
are
professing
to
teach
or
is
there
anything
about
which
even
the
acknowledged
are
sometimes
saying
that
thing
can
be
taught
and
sometimes
the
opposite
can
you
say
that
they
are
teachers
in
any
true
sense
whose
ideas
are
in
such
confusion
meno
i
should
say
certainly
not
socrates
but
if
neither
the
sophists
nor
the
gentlemen
are
teachers
clearly
there
can
be
no
other
teachers
meno
no
socrates
and
if
there
are
no
teachers
neither
are
there
disciples
meno
agreed
socrates
and
we
have
admitted
that
a
thing
can
not
be
taught
of
which
there
are
neither
teachers
nor
disciples
meno
we
have
socrates
and
there
are
no
teachers
of
virtue
to
be
found
anywhere
meno
there
are
not
socrates
and
if
there
are
no
teachers
neither
are
there
scholars
meno
that
i
think
is
true
socrates
then
virtue
can
not
be
taught
meno
not
if
we
are
right
in
our
view
but
i
can
not
believe
socrates
that
there
are
no
good
men
and
if
there
are
how
did
they
come
into
existence
socrates
i
am
afraid
meno
that
you
and
i
are
not
good
for
much
and
that
gorgias
has
been
as
poor
an
educator
of
you
as
prodicus
has
been
of
me
certainly
we
shall
have
to
look
to
ourselves
and
try
to
find
some
one
who
will
help
in
some
way
or
other
to
improve
us
this
i
say
because
i
observe
that
in
the
previous
discussion
none
of
us
remarked
that
right
and
good
action
is
possible
to
man
under
other
guidance
than
that
of
knowledge
episteme
and
indeed
if
this
be
denied
there
is
no
seeing
how
there
can
be
any
good
men
at
all
meno
how
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
i
mean
that
good
men
are
necessarily
useful
or
profitable
were
we
not
right
in
admitting
this
it
must
be
so
meno
yes
socrates
and
in
supposing
that
they
will
be
useful
only
if
they
are
true
guides
to
us
of
action
there
we
were
also
right
meno
yes
socrates
but
when
we
said
that
a
man
can
not
be
a
good
guide
unless
he
have
knowledge
phrhonesis
this
we
were
wrong
meno
what
do
you
mean
by
the
word
socrates
i
will
explain
if
a
man
knew
the
way
to
larisa
or
anywhere
else
and
went
to
the
place
and
led
others
thither
would
he
not
be
a
right
and
good
guide
meno
certainly
socrates
and
a
person
who
had
a
right
opinion
about
the
way
but
had
never
been
and
did
not
know
might
be
a
good
guide
also
might
he
not
meno
certainly
socrates
and
while
he
has
true
opinion
about
that
which
the
other
knows
he
will
be
just
as
good
a
guide
if
he
thinks
the
truth
as
he
who
knows
the
truth
meno
exactly
socrates
then
true
opinion
is
as
good
a
guide
to
correct
action
as
knowledge
and
that
was
the
point
which
we
omitted
in
our
speculation
about
the
nature
of
virtue
when
we
said
that
knowledge
only
is
the
guide
of
right
action
whereas
there
is
also
right
opinion
meno
true
socrates
then
right
opinion
is
not
less
useful
than
knowledge
meno
the
difference
socrates
is
only
that
he
who
has
knowledge
will
always
be
right
but
he
who
has
right
opinion
will
sometimes
be
right
and
sometimes
not
socrates
what
do
you
mean
can
he
be
wrong
who
has
right
opinion
so
long
as
he
has
right
opinion
meno
i
admit
the
cogency
of
your
argument
and
therefore
socrates
i
wonder
that
knowledge
should
be
preferred
to
right
opinion
or
why
they
should
ever
differ
socrates
and
shall
i
explain
this
wonder
to
you
meno
do
tell
me
socrates
you
would
not
wonder
if
you
had
ever
observed
the
images
of
daedalus
compare
euthyphro
but
perhaps
you
have
not
got
them
in
your
country
meno
what
have
they
to
do
with
the
question
socrates
because
they
require
to
be
fastened
in
order
to
keep
them
and
if
they
are
not
fastened
they
will
play
truant
and
run
away
meno
well
what
of
that
socrates
i
mean
to
say
that
they
are
not
very
valuable
possessions
if
they
are
at
liberty
for
they
will
walk
off
like
runaway
slaves
but
when
fastened
they
are
of
great
value
for
they
are
really
beautiful
works
of
art
now
this
is
an
illustration
of
the
nature
of
true
opinions
while
they
abide
with
us
they
are
beautiful
and
fruitful
but
they
run
away
out
of
the
human
soul
and
do
not
remain
long
and
therefore
they
are
not
of
much
value
until
they
are
fastened
by
the
tie
of
the
cause
and
this
fastening
of
them
friend
meno
is
recollection
as
you
and
i
have
agreed
to
call
it
but
when
they
are
bound
in
the
first
place
they
have
the
nature
of
knowledge
and
in
the
second
place
they
are
abiding
and
this
is
why
knowledge
is
more
honourable
and
excellent
than
true
opinion
because
fastened
by
a
chain
meno
what
you
are
saying
socrates
seems
to
be
very
like
the
truth
socrates
i
too
speak
rather
in
ignorance
i
only
conjecture
and
yet
that
knowledge
differs
from
true
opinion
is
no
matter
of
conjecture
with
me
there
are
not
many
things
which
i
profess
to
know
but
this
is
most
certainly
one
of
them
meno
yes
socrates
and
you
are
quite
right
in
saying
so
socrates
and
am
i
not
also
right
in
saying
that
true
opinion
leading
the
way
perfects
action
quite
as
well
as
knowledge
meno
there
again
socrates
i
think
you
are
right
socrates
then
right
opinion
is
not
a
whit
inferior
to
knowledge
or
less
useful
in
action
nor
is
the
man
who
has
right
opinion
inferior
to
him
who
has
knowledge
meno
true
socrates
and
surely
the
good
man
has
been
acknowledged
by
us
to
be
useful
meno
yes
socrates
seeing
then
that
men
become
good
and
useful
to
states
not
only
because
they
have
knowledge
but
because
they
have
right
opinion
and
that
neither
knowledge
nor
right
opinion
is
given
to
man
by
nature
or
acquired
by
him
do
you
imagine
either
of
them
to
be
given
by
nature
meno
not
i
socrates
then
if
they
are
not
given
by
nature
neither
are
the
good
by
nature
good
meno
certainly
not
socrates
and
nature
being
excluded
then
came
the
question
whether
virtue
is
acquired
by
teaching
meno
yes
socrates
if
virtue
was
wisdom
or
knowledge
then
as
we
thought
it
was
taught
meno
yes
socrates
and
if
it
was
taught
it
was
wisdom
meno
certainly
socrates
and
if
there
were
teachers
it
might
be
taught
and
if
there
were
no
teachers
not
meno
true
socrates
but
surely
we
acknowledged
that
there
were
no
teachers
of
virtue
meno
yes
socrates
then
we
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
taught
and
was
not
wisdom
meno
certainly
socrates
and
yet
we
admitted
that
it
was
a
good
meno
yes
socrates
and
the
right
guide
is
useful
and
good
meno
certainly
socrates
and
the
only
right
guides
are
knowledge
and
true
opinion
these
are
the
guides
of
man
for
things
which
happen
by
chance
are
not
under
the
guidance
of
man
but
the
guides
of
man
are
true
opinion
and
knowledge
meno
i
think
so
too
socrates
but
if
virtue
is
not
taught
neither
is
virtue
knowledge
meno
clearly
not
socrates
then
of
two
good
and
useful
things
one
which
is
knowledge
has
been
set
aside
and
can
not
be
supposed
to
be
our
guide
in
political
life
meno
i
think
not
socrates
and
therefore
not
by
any
wisdom
and
not
because
they
were
wise
did
themistocles
and
those
others
of
whom
anytus
spoke
govern
states
this
was
the
reason
why
they
were
unable
to
make
others
like
themselves
because
their
virtue
was
not
grounded
on
knowledge
meno
that
is
probably
true
socrates
socrates
but
if
not
by
knowledge
the
only
alternative
which
remains
is
that
statesmen
must
have
guided
states
by
right
opinion
which
is
in
politics
what
divination
is
in
religion
for
diviners
and
also
prophets
say
many
things
truly
but
they
know
not
what
they
say
meno
so
i
believe
socrates
and
may
we
not
meno
truly
call
those
men
who
having
no
understanding
yet
succeed
in
many
a
grand
deed
and
word
meno
certainly
socrates
then
we
shall
also
be
right
in
calling
divine
those
whom
we
were
just
now
speaking
of
as
diviners
and
prophets
including
the
whole
tribe
of
poets
yes
and
statesmen
above
all
may
be
said
to
be
divine
and
illumined
being
inspired
and
possessed
of
god
in
which
condition
they
say
many
grand
things
not
knowing
what
they
say
meno
yes
socrates
and
the
women
too
meno
call
good
men
divine
do
they
not
and
the
spartans
when
they
praise
a
good
man
say
he
is
a
divine
man
meno
and
i
think
socrates
that
they
are
right
although
very
likely
our
friend
anytus
may
take
offence
at
the
word
socrates
i
do
not
care
as
for
anytus
there
will
be
another
opportunity
of
talking
with
him
to
sum
up
our
enquiry
the
result
seems
to
be
if
we
are
at
all
right
in
our
view
that
virtue
is
neither
natural
nor
acquired
but
an
instinct
given
by
god
to
the
virtuous
nor
is
the
instinct
accompanied
by
reason
unless
there
may
be
supposed
to
be
among
statesmen
some
one
who
is
capable
of
educating
statesmen
and
if
there
be
such
an
one
he
may
be
said
to
be
among
the
living
what
homer
says
that
tiresias
was
among
the
dead
alone
has
understanding
but
the
rest
are
flitting
shades
and
he
and
his
virtue
in
like
manner
will
be
a
reality
among
shadows
meno
that
is
excellent
socrates
socrates
then
meno
the
conclusion
is
that
virtue
comes
to
the
virtuous
by
the
gift
of
god
but
we
shall
never
know
the
certain
truth
until
before
asking
how
virtue
is
given
we
enquire
into
the
actual
nature
of
virtue
i
fear
that
i
must
go
away
but
do
you
now
that
you
are
persuaded
yourself
persuade
our
friend
anytus
and
do
not
let
him
be
so
exasperated
if
you
can
conciliate
him
you
will
have
done
good
service
to
the
athenian
people
