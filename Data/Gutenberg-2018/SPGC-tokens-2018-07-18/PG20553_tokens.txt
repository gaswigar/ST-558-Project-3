caught
his
hand
and
pulled
him
to
out
around
rigel
by
robert
wilson
note
an
astounding
chronicle
of
two
lunarians
conquest
of
time
and
interstellar
space
the
sun
had
dropped
behind
the
grimaldi
plateau
although
for
a
day
twilight
would
linger
over
the
oceanus
procellarum
the
sky
was
a
hazy
blue
and
out
over
the
deeper
tinted
waves
the
full
earth
swung
all
the
long
it
had
hung
there
above
the
horizon
its
light
dimmed
by
the
sunshine
growing
from
a
thin
crescent
to
its
full
disk
three
times
as
broad
as
that
of
the
sun
at
setting
now
in
the
dusk
it
was
a
great
silver
lamp
hanging
over
nardos
the
beautiful
the
city
built
on
the
water
the
light
glimmered
over
the
tall
white
towers
over
the
white
adamantine
bridge
running
from
nardos
to
the
shore
and
lit
up
the
beach
where
we
were
standing
with
a
brightness
that
seemed
almost
that
of
day
once
more
garth
i
said
i
get
that
trick
yet
the
skin
of
my
bare
chest
still
smarted
from
the
blow
of
his
wooden
fencing
sword
if
it
had
been
the
real
lunarian
dueling
sword
with
its
terrible
mass
behind
a
curved
razor
edge
the
blow
would
have
produced
a
cut
deep
into
the
bone
it
was
always
the
same
ever
since
garth
and
i
had
fenced
as
boys
with
crooked
laths
back
to
back
we
could
beat
the
whole
school
but
i
never
had
a
chance
against
him
perhaps
one
time
in
ten
on
guard
the
silvered
swords
whirled
in
the
i
nicked
him
on
one
wrist
and
had
to
duck
to
escape
his
wild
swing
at
my
head
the
wooden
blades
were
now
locked
by
the
hilts
above
our
heads
when
he
stepped
back
to
get
free
i
lunged
and
twisted
his
weapon
in
a
beautiful
parabola
garth
sword
sailed
out
into
the
water
and
he
dropped
to
the
sand
to
nurse
his
right
wrist
confound
your
wrestling
dunal
if
you
broken
my
arm
on
the
eve
of
my
flight
it
not
even
a
sprain
your
wrists
are
weak
and
i
supposed
always
been
considerate
of
me
three
broken
ribs
for
half
a
cent
he
was
on
his
feet
and
then
kelvar
came
up
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
until
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
swimming
in
the
surf
watching
us
the
shimmered
over
her
white
skin
still
faintly
moist
and
blazed
out
in
blue
sparkles
from
the
jewels
of
the
breastplates
and
trunks
she
had
put
on
when
she
touched
garth
and
he
smiled
i
wanted
to
smash
in
his
dark
face
and
then
take
the
beating
i
would
deserve
yet
if
she
preferred
him
and
the
two
of
us
had
been
friends
before
she
was
born
i
put
out
my
hand
whatever
happens
garth
we
still
be
friends
whatever
happens
we
clasped
hands
garth
kelvar
said
it
getting
dark
show
us
your
ship
before
you
go
all
right
he
had
always
been
like
that
one
minute
in
a
black
rage
the
next
perfectly
agreeable
he
now
led
the
way
up
to
a
cliff
hanging
over
the
sea
there
said
garth
is
the
our
greatest
step
in
conquering
distance
after
i
tried
it
out
we
can
go
in
a
year
to
the
end
of
the
universe
but
for
a
starter
how
about
a
thousand
around
rigel
in
six
months
his
eyes
were
afire
then
he
calmed
down
anything
i
can
show
you
note
editor
note
the
manuscript
of
which
a
translation
is
here
presented
was
discovered
by
the
expedition
to
the
moon
three
years
ago
it
was
found
in
its
box
by
the
last
crumbling
ruins
of
the
great
bridge
mentioned
in
the
narrative
its
final
translation
is
a
tribute
at
once
to
the
philological
skill
of
the
earth
and
to
the
marvelous
dictionary
provided
by
dunal
the
lunarian
stars
and
lunar
localities
will
be
given
their
traditional
earth
names
and
measures
of
time
weight
and
distance
have
been
reduced
in
round
numbers
to
terrestrial
equivalents
of
the
space
ship
described
the
no
trace
has
been
found
it
must
be
buried
under
the
rim
of
one
of
the
hundreds
of
nearby
lunar
craters
the
result
as
some
astronomers
have
long
suspected
and
as
dunal
story
verifies
of
a
great
swarm
of
meteors
striking
the
unprotected
airless
moon
i
had
seen
the
before
but
never
so
close
with
a
hull
of
shining
the
new
light
inactive
alloy
of
a
metal
and
a
gas
the
ship
was
a
cylinder
about
twenty
feet
long
by
fifteen
in
diameter
while
a
pointed
nose
stretched
five
feet
farther
at
each
end
fixed
in
each
point
was
a
telescopic
lens
while
there
were
windows
along
the
sides
and
at
the
top
all
made
garth
informed
us
of
another
form
of
the
alloy
almost
as
strong
as
the
opaque
variety
running
out
each
end
were
four
fins
which
served
to
apply
the
power
driving
the
craft
a
light
inside
showed
the
interior
to
be
a
single
room
ten
feet
high
at
the
center
of
its
cylindrical
ceiling
with
a
level
floor
how
do
you
know
this
will
be
the
bottom
i
asked
giving
the
vessel
a
shove
to
roll
it
over
but
it
would
not
budge
garth
laughed
five
hundred
pounds
of
mercury
and
the
disintegrators
are
under
that
floor
while
out
in
space
i
have
an
auxiliary
gravity
engine
to
keep
my
feet
there
you
see
since
your
mathematical
friends
derived
their
identical
formulas
for
gravity
and
electromagnetism
my
job
was
pretty
easy
as
you
know
a
falling
body
follows
the
line
of
least
resistance
in
a
field
of
distortion
of
space
caused
by
mass
i
bend
space
into
another
such
field
by
electromagnetic
means
and
the
flies
down
the
track
working
the
mercury
disintegrators
at
full
power
i
can
get
an
acceleration
of
two
hundred
miles
per
second
which
will
build
up
the
speed
at
the
midpoint
of
my
trip
to
almost
four
thousand
times
that
of
light
then
i
have
to
start
slowing
down
but
at
the
average
speed
the
journey
will
take
only
six
months
or
so
but
can
anyone
stand
that
acceleration
kelvar
asked
i
had
it
on
and
felt
nothing
with
a
rocket
exhaust
shoving
the
ship
it
could
be
done
but
my
gravitational
field
attracts
the
occupant
of
the
just
as
much
as
the
vessel
itself
you
sure
i
interrupted
that
you
have
enough
power
to
keep
up
the
acceleration
easily
there
a
margin
of
safety
and
you
have
considered
that
it
may
get
harder
to
push
you
know
the
increase
of
mass
with
velocity
you
ca
take
of
the
relativity
theory
without
the
other
and
they
actually
measured
the
increase
of
weight
in
an
electron
the
electron
never
knew
it
it
all
a
matter
of
reference
points
i
ca
follow
the
math
but
i
know
that
from
the
electron
standards
it
stayed
exactly
the
same
weight
anything
else
is
nonsense
well
there
may
be
a
flaw
in
the
reasoning
but
as
they
worked
it
out
nothing
can
go
faster
than
light
as
you
approach
that
velocity
the
mass
keeps
increasing
and
with
it
the
amount
of
energy
required
for
a
new
increase
in
speed
at
the
speed
of
light
the
mass
would
be
infinite
and
hence
no
finite
energy
could
get
you
any
further
maybe
so
it
wo
take
long
to
find
out
a
few
of
the
brightest
stars
had
begun
to
appear
we
could
just
see
the
parallelogram
of
orion
with
red
betelguese
at
one
corner
and
across
from
it
rigel
scintillant
like
a
blue
diamond
see
garth
said
pointing
at
it
three
months
from
now
that
where
i
be
the
first
man
who
dared
to
sail
among
the
stars
only
because
you
do
let
anyone
else
share
the
glory
and
the
danger
why
should
i
but
you
would
go
anyway
will
you
let
me
i
had
him
there
on
your
head
be
it
the
could
hold
three
or
four
in
a
pinch
and
i
have
plenty
of
provisions
if
you
really
want
to
take
the
chance
it
wo
be
the
first
we
taken
together
all
right
we
start
in
ten
minutes
he
went
inside
the
ship
do
go
kelvar
whispered
coming
into
the
shadow
tell
him
anything
but
do
go
i
got
to
i
ca
go
back
on
my
word
he
think
i
was
afraid
have
you
a
right
to
be
garth
is
my
friend
and
i
going
with
him
all
right
but
i
wish
you
would
from
inside
came
the
throb
of
engines
kelvar
i
said
you
did
worry
when
only
garth
was
going
no
and
there
less
danger
with
two
to
keep
watch
i
know
but
still
you
are
afraid
for
i
am
afraid
for
you
my
arm
slipped
around
her
there
in
the
shadow
and
when
i
come
back
kelvar
we
be
married
in
answer
she
kissed
me
then
garth
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
dunal
where
are
you
we
separated
and
came
out
of
the
shadow
i
went
up
the
plank
to
the
door
kicking
it
out
behind
me
kelvar
waved
and
i
called
something
or
other
to
her
then
the
door
clanged
shut
seated
before
the
control
board
at
the
front
of
the
room
garth
held
the
switch
for
the
two
projectors
both
turned
up
he
yelled
over
the
roar
of
the
generators
his
hands
swung
over
and
the
noise
died
down
but
nothing
else
seemed
to
have
happened
i
turned
back
again
to
look
out
the
little
window
fixed
in
the
door
down
far
below
i
could
see
for
a
moment
the
city
of
nardos
with
its
great
white
bridge
and
a
spot
that
might
be
kelvar
then
there
was
only
the
ocean
sparkling
in
the
growing
smaller
smaller
and
then
we
had
shot
out
of
the
atmosphere
into
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
a
thousand
stars
on
and
up
we
went
until
the
moon
was
a
crescent
with
stars
around
it
then
garth
threw
the
power
forward
might
as
well
turn
in
he
told
me
there
be
nothing
interesting
until
we
get
out
of
the
solar
system
and
i
can
put
on
real
speed
take
the
first
trick
how
long
watches
shall
we
stand
eighteen
hours
ought
to
match
the
way
we
have
been
living
if
you
have
another
preference
no
that
will
be
all
right
and
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
get
in
some
sleep
now
i
was
not
really
sleepy
but
only
dazed
a
little
by
the
adventure
i
fixed
some
things
on
the
floor
by
one
of
the
windows
and
lay
down
switching
out
the
light
through
a
top
window
the
sunlight
slanted
down
to
fall
around
garth
at
his
instrument
board
in
a
bright
glory
from
my
window
i
could
see
the
earth
and
the
gleaming
stars
the
earth
was
smaller
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
before
it
seemed
to
be
moving
backward
a
little
and
even
more
to
be
changing
phase
i
closed
my
eyes
and
when
i
opened
them
again
sleepily
the
bright
area
was
perceptibly
smaller
if
i
could
stay
awake
long
enough
there
would
be
only
a
crescent
again
if
i
could
stay
awake
but
i
could
not
only
the
rattling
of
dishes
as
garth
prepared
breakfast
brought
me
back
to
consciousness
i
got
to
my
feet
sheepishly
how
long
have
i
slept
twenty
hours
straight
you
looked
as
if
you
might
have
gone
on
forever
it
the
lack
of
disturbance
to
indicate
time
i
got
in
a
little
myself
once
we
were
out
of
the
solar
system
a
sandwich
in
one
hand
i
wandered
over
the
vessel
it
was
reassuringly
solid
and
concrete
and
yet
there
was
something
lacking
garth
i
asked
what
become
of
the
sun
i
thought
you
want
to
know
that
he
led
me
to
the
rear
telescope
but
i
do
see
anything
you
have
caught
on
yet
see
that
bright
yellowish
star
on
the
edge
of
the
constellation
scorpio
that
it
involuntarily
i
gasped
then
how
far
away
are
we
i
put
on
full
acceleration
fifteen
hours
ago
when
we
passed
neptune
and
we
have
covered
thirty
billion
miles
three
hundred
times
as
far
as
from
the
moon
to
the
sun
but
only
one
half
of
one
per
cent
of
a
i
was
speechless
and
garth
led
me
back
to
the
control
board
he
pointed
out
the
acceleration
control
now
turned
up
to
its
last
notch
forward
he
also
showed
me
the
dials
which
were
used
to
change
our
direction
just
keep
that
star
on
the
cross
hairs
it
pi
orionis
a
little
out
of
our
course
but
a
good
target
since
it
is
only
away
half
the
light
is
deflected
on
this
screen
with
a
delicate
cell
at
its
center
the
instant
the
light
of
the
star
slips
off
it
a
relay
is
started
which
lights
a
red
lamp
here
and
in
a
minute
sounds
a
warning
bell
that
indicator
over
there
shows
our
approach
to
any
body
it
works
by
the
interaction
of
the
gravitational
field
with
that
of
my
projector
and
we
can
spot
anything
sizable
an
hour
away
sure
you
got
everything
it
all
seemed
clear
then
i
noticed
at
the
top
three
dials
one
to
read
days
another
to
record
the
speeds
of
light
and
the
third
to
mark
traveled
these
ca
really
work
i
said
we
have
no
way
to
check
our
speed
with
outer
space
not
directly
this
is
geared
with
clockwork
to
represent
an
estimate
based
on
the
acceleration
if
your
theory
is
right
then
the
dials
are
all
wrong
and
how
long
do
you
expect
to
go
ahead
without
knowing
the
truth
until
we
ought
to
be
at
pi
orionis
at
two
weeks
and
by
the
dials
if
we
are
there
we
start
back
by
your
figuring
we
should
be
yet
one
on
the
way
anything
more
no
i
think
i
can
manage
it
wake
me
if
anything
wrong
and
look
out
for
dark
stars
then
he
had
left
me
there
at
the
controls
in
five
minutes
he
was
asleep
and
the
whole
ship
was
in
my
hands
for
hours
nothing
happened
without
any
control
of
mine
the
ship
went
straight
ahead
i
could
get
up
and
walk
about
with
a
weather
eye
on
the
board
and
never
was
there
the
flash
of
a
danger
light
but
i
was
unable
to
feel
confident
and
went
back
to
look
out
through
the
glass
the
stars
were
incredibly
bright
and
clear
right
ahead
were
betelguese
and
rigel
and
the
great
nebula
of
orion
still
beyond
there
was
no
twinkling
but
each
star
a
bright
steady
point
of
light
and
if
indicators
were
correct
we
were
moving
toward
them
at
a
speed
now
times
that
of
light
itself
if
they
were
correct
how
could
one
know
before
the
long
two
weeks
were
over
but
before
i
could
begin
to
think
of
any
plan
my
eye
was
caught
by
the
red
lamp
flashing
on
the
panel
i
pressed
the
attention
button
before
the
alarm
could
ring
then
started
looking
for
the
body
we
were
in
danger
of
striking
the
position
indicators
pointed
straight
ahead
but
i
could
see
nothing
for
ten
minutes
i
peered
through
the
telescope
and
still
no
sign
the
dials
put
the
thing
off
a
degree
or
so
to
the
right
now
but
that
was
too
close
in
five
more
minutes
i
would
swing
straight
up
and
give
whatever
it
was
a
wide
berth
i
looked
out
again
in
the
angle
between
the
cross
hairs
was
there
a
slight
haze
in
a
moment
it
was
clear
a
comet
apparently
the
two
of
us
racing
toward
each
other
bigger
it
grew
and
bigger
hurtling
forward
would
we
hit
the
dials
put
it
up
a
little
and
far
off
to
the
right
but
it
was
still
frightening
the
other
light
had
come
on
too
and
i
saw
that
we
had
been
pulled
off
our
course
by
the
comet
attraction
i
threw
the
nose
over
past
on
the
other
side
for
leeway
then
straightened
up
as
the
dial
gave
a
big
jump
away
though
the
gaseous
globe
tailless
of
course
away
from
the
sun
showed
as
big
as
the
full
earth
the
danger
was
past
as
i
watched
the
comet
vanished
from
the
field
of
the
telescope
five
minutes
perhaps
with
the
red
danger
light
flickering
all
the
time
then
with
a
ghastly
flare
through
the
right
hand
windows
it
had
passed
us
garth
sat
straight
up
what
happened
he
yelled
just
a
comet
i
got
by
all
right
he
settled
back
having
been
scarcely
awake
and
i
turned
to
the
board
again
the
danger
light
had
gone
out
but
the
direction
indicator
was
burning
the
near
approach
of
the
comet
had
thrown
us
off
our
course
by
several
degrees
i
straightened
the
ship
up
easily
and
had
only
a
little
more
difficulty
in
stopping
a
rocking
motion
then
again
the
empty
hours
of
watching
gazing
into
the
stars
precisely
at
the
end
of
eighteen
hours
garth
awakened
as
if
the
consummation
of
a
certain
number
of
internal
processes
had
set
off
a
little
alarm
clock
in
his
brain
we
were
hours
out
with
a
speed
according
to
the
indicator
of
one
hundred
and
times
that
of
light
and
a
total
distance
covered
of
slightly
over
one
quarter
of
a
a
rather
small
stretch
compared
to
the
we
had
to
go
but
when
i
went
back
for
a
look
out
of
the
rear
telescope
the
familiar
stars
seemed
to
have
moved
the
least
bit
closer
together
and
the
sun
was
no
brighter
than
a
great
number
of
them
i
slept
like
a
log
but
awakened
a
little
before
my
trick
was
due
exactly
on
schedule
fourteen
days
and
some
hours
after
we
had
started
off
we
passed
pi
orionis
for
long
there
had
been
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
whatever
the
explanation
our
acceleration
was
holding
steady
in
the
last
few
hours
the
star
swept
up
to
the
brilliance
of
the
sun
then
faded
again
until
it
was
no
brighter
than
venus
venus
our
sun
itself
had
been
a
mere
dot
in
the
rear
telescope
until
the
change
in
our
course
threw
it
out
of
the
field
of
vision
at
days
out
beta
eridani
was
almost
directly
in
our
path
for
rigel
slightly
less
than
a
third
of
the
distance
to
the
midpoint
in
over
half
the
time
but
our
speed
was
still
increasing
miles
a
second
every
second
almost
four
times
the
speed
of
light
in
an
hour
our
watches
went
on
with
a
not
altogether
disagreeable
monotony
there
was
no
star
to
mark
the
middle
of
our
journey
only
toward
the
close
of
one
of
my
watches
a
blue
light
which
i
had
never
noticed
came
on
beside
the
indicator
dials
and
i
saw
that
we
had
covered
half
the
estimated
distance
to
rigel
the
speed
marker
indicated
times
the
speed
of
light
i
wakened
garth
you
could
have
done
it
yourself
he
complained
sleepily
but
i
suppose
it
just
as
well
he
went
over
to
the
board
and
started
warming
up
the
rear
gravity
projector
we
turn
one
off
as
the
other
goes
on
each
take
one
control
and
go
a
notch
at
a
time
he
began
counting
one
two
three
on
the
twentieth
count
my
dial
was
down
to
zero
his
up
to
maximum
deceleration
and
i
pulled
out
my
switch
garth
snapped
sideways
a
lever
on
the
indicators
though
nothing
seemed
to
happen
i
knew
that
the
speed
dial
would
creep
backward
and
the
distance
dial
progress
at
a
slower
and
slower
rate
while
i
was
trying
to
see
the
motion
garth
had
gone
back
to
bed
i
turned
again
to
the
glass
and
looked
out
at
rigel
on
the
cross
hairs
and
kappa
orionis
over
to
the
left
and
the
great
nebula
reaching
over
a
quarter
of
the
view
with
its
faint
gaseous
streamers
and
so
we
swept
on
through
space
with
rigel
a
great
blue
glory
ahead
and
new
stars
invisible
at
greater
distances
flaring
up
in
front
of
us
and
then
fading
into
the
background
as
we
passed
for
a
long
time
we
had
been
able
to
see
that
rigel
as
inferred
from
spectroscopic
evidence
was
a
double
star
a
fainter
greener
blue
companion
revolving
with
it
around
their
common
center
of
gravity
beyond
kappa
orionis
three
hundred
from
the
sun
the
space
between
the
two
was
quite
evident
beyond
four
hundred
the
brilliance
of
the
vast
star
was
so
great
that
it
dimmed
all
the
other
stars
by
comparison
and
made
the
nebula
seem
a
mere
faint
gauze
and
yet
even
with
this
gradual
change
our
arrival
was
a
surprise
when
he
relieved
me
at
my
watch
garth
seemed
dissatisfied
with
our
progress
it
must
be
farther
than
they
figured
i
stick
at
times
light
speed
and
slow
down
after
we
get
there
by
taking
an
orbit
i
have
said
it
was
nearer
than
the
estimate
i
tried
to
argue
but
was
too
sleepy
to
remember
my
reasons
propped
up
on
one
elbow
i
looked
around
and
out
at
the
stars
there
was
a
bright
splash
of
light
i
noticed
where
the
telescope
concentrated
the
radiation
of
rigel
at
one
spot
on
the
screen
i
slept
and
then
garth
was
shouting
in
my
ear
we
there
i
opened
my
eyes
blinked
and
shut
them
again
in
the
glare
i
gone
around
three
or
four
times
trying
to
slow
down
we
there
and
there
a
planet
to
land
on
at
last
i
could
see
out
the
window
opposite
me
rigel
was
a
disk
half
the
size
of
the
sun
but
brighter
with
the
companion
star
a
sort
of
faint
reflection
five
or
ten
degrees
to
the
side
and
still
beyond
as
i
shaded
my
eyes
i
could
see
swimming
in
the
black
a
speck
with
the
unmistakable
glow
of
reflected
light
with
both
gravity
projectors
in
readiness
we
pulled
out
of
our
orbit
and
straight
across
toward
the
planet
letting
the
attraction
of
rigel
fight
against
our
still
tremendous
speed
for
a
while
the
pull
of
the
big
star
was
almost
overpowering
then
we
got
past
and
into
the
gravitational
field
of
the
planet
we
spiralled
down
around
it
looking
for
a
landing
place
and
trying
to
match
our
speed
with
its
rotational
velocity
from
rather
unreliable
observations
the
planet
seemed
a
good
deal
smaller
than
the
moon
and
yet
so
dense
as
to
have
a
greater
gravitational
attraction
the
atmosphere
was
cloudless
and
the
surface
a
forbidding
expanse
of
sand
the
globe
whirled
at
a
rate
that
must
give
it
a
day
of
approximately
five
hours
we
angled
down
picking
a
spot
just
within
the
lighted
area
a
landing
was
quite
feasible
as
we
broke
through
the
atmosphere
we
could
see
that
the
sand
although
blotched
with
dark
patches
here
and
there
was
comparatively
smooth
at
one
place
there
was
a
level
outcropping
of
rock
and
over
this
we
hung
it
was
hard
work
watching
through
the
single
small
port
in
the
floor
as
we
settled
down
finally
the
view
was
too
small
to
be
of
any
use
i
ran
to
the
side
window
only
to
find
my
eyes
blinded
by
rigel
blaze
then
we
had
landed
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
rigel
set
half
overlapped
by
the
greater
star
the
faint
companion
had
been
hidden
in
its
glare
now
in
the
dusk
a
corner
of
it
hung
ghostlike
on
the
horizon
and
then
too
had
disappeared
i
flashed
on
our
lights
while
garth
cut
out
the
projector
and
the
floor
gravity
machine
the
increase
in
weight
was
apparent
but
not
particularly
unpleasant
after
a
few
minutes
of
walking
up
and
down
i
got
used
to
it
through
a
in
the
wall
garth
had
drawn
in
a
tube
of
gas
from
the
atmosphere
outside
and
was
analyzing
it
with
a
spectroscope
we
can
go
out
he
said
it
unbreathable
but
we
be
able
to
use
the
space
suits
mostly
fluorine
it
would
eat
your
lungs
out
like
that
and
the
suits
fortunately
they
been
covered
with
paint
and
the
helmet
glass
is
the
same
stuff
not
even
that
atmosphere
can
touch
it
i
suppose
there
can
be
no
life
on
the
place
with
all
this
sand
it
would
have
to
be
based
on
silicon
instead
of
carbon
and
it
would
have
to
breathe
fluorine
he
got
out
the
suits
rather
like
a
diver
with
the
body
of
cloth
and
the
helmet
of
the
metal
itself
on
the
shoulders
was
an
air
supply
cylinder
the
helmets
were
fixed
with
radio
so
we
could
have
talked
to
each
other
even
in
airless
space
we
said
almost
anything
to
try
it
out
glad
you
brought
two
and
we
do
have
to
explore
in
shifts
yes
i
was
prepared
for
emergencies
shall
we
wait
for
daylight
to
go
out
i
ca
see
why
and
these
outfits
will
probably
feel
better
in
the
cool
let
see
we
shot
a
searchlight
beam
out
the
window
there
was
a
slight
drop
down
from
the
rock
where
we
rested
then
the
sandy
plain
stretching
out
only
far
off
were
those
dark
patches
that
looked
like
old
seaweed
on
a
ocean
bed
and
might
prove
dangerous
footing
the
rest
seemed
hard
packed
my
heart
was
pounding
as
we
went
into
the
and
fastened
the
inner
door
behind
us
we
go
straight
out
now
garth
explained
coming
back
it
will
be
necessary
to
press
this
button
and
let
the
pump
get
rid
of
the
poisonous
air
before
going
in
i
opened
the
outer
door
and
started
to
step
out
then
realized
that
there
was
a
drop
to
the
ground
go
ahead
and
jump
garth
said
there
a
ladder
inside
i
should
have
brought
but
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
to
go
back
through
the
lock
for
it
either
of
us
can
jump
eight
feet
at
home
and
we
get
back
up
somehow
i
jumped
failing
to
allow
for
the
slightly
greater
gravity
and
fell
sprawling
garth
got
down
more
successfully
in
spite
of
a
long
package
of
some
sort
he
carried
in
his
hand
scrambling
down
from
the
cliff
and
walking
out
on
the
sand
i
tried
to
get
used
to
the
combination
of
greater
weight
and
the
awkward
suit
if
i
stepped
very
deliberately
it
was
all
right
but
an
attempt
to
run
sank
my
feet
in
the
sand
and
brought
me
up
staggering
there
was
no
trouble
seeing
through
the
glass
of
my
helmet
over
wide
angles
standing
on
the
elevation
by
the
his
shining
in
the
light
from
the
windows
garth
looked
like
a
metallic
monster
some
creature
of
this
strange
world
and
i
must
have
presented
to
him
much
the
same
appearance
silhouetted
dark
and
forbidding
against
the
stars
the
stars
i
looked
up
and
beheld
the
most
marvelous
sight
of
the
whole
trip
the
great
nebula
of
orion
seen
from
a
distance
of
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
its
own
width
a
great
luminous
curtain
fifty
degrees
across
i
could
just
take
it
all
in
with
my
eye
the
central
brilliancy
as
big
as
the
sun
a
smaller
one
above
it
and
then
the
whole
mass
of
gas
stretching
over
the
sky
the
whole
thing
aglow
with
the
green
light
of
nebulium
and
blazing
with
the
stars
behind
it
it
was
stupendous
beyond
words
i
started
to
call
garth
then
saw
that
he
was
looking
up
as
well
for
almost
half
an
hour
i
watched
as
the
edge
of
the
nebula
sank
below
the
horizon
then
its
light
began
to
dim
turning
i
saw
that
the
sky
opposite
was
already
gray
the
dawn
why
the
sun
had
just
set
then
i
realized
it
was
over
an
hour
since
we
had
landed
and
a
full
night
would
be
scarcely
two
hours
and
a
half
if
we
were
in
a
summer
latitude
the
shorter
period
of
darkness
was
natural
enough
and
yet
it
was
still
hard
to
believe
as
within
ten
minutes
it
was
as
bright
as
on
the
moon
still
clearer
and
clearer
grew
the
light
the
stars
were
almost
gone
the
center
of
the
nebula
only
a
faint
wisp
there
were
no
clouds
to
give
the
colors
of
sunrise
but
a
radiance
seemed
to
be
trembling
on
the
eastern
horizon
and
then
like
a
shot
rigel
came
up
into
the
sky
the
light
and
heat
struck
me
like
something
solid
and
i
turned
away
even
with
my
suit
reflecting
most
of
the
light
away
i
felt
noticeably
warm
the
shone
like
a
blinding
mirror
so
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
garth
on
the
plain
below
it
stumbling
and
shielding
my
eyes
with
my
hand
i
made
my
way
toward
him
he
was
standing
erect
in
his
hands
two
old
lunarian
dueling
swords
there
was
hate
in
his
voice
as
the
radio
brought
it
in
my
ears
dunal
only
one
of
us
is
going
back
to
the
moon
i
stared
was
the
heat
getting
him
had
we
better
go
inside
i
said
quietly
and
somewhat
soothingly
he
made
no
reply
but
only
held
out
one
of
the
hilts
i
took
it
dumbly
in
that
instant
he
could
have
struck
my
head
from
my
body
if
he
wished
but
garth
old
friend
no
friend
to
you
you
shall
win
kelvar
now
or
i
giving
you
a
sporting
chance
one
of
your
light
cuts
letting
the
fluorine
inside
will
be
as
deadly
as
anything
i
can
do
the
one
who
goes
back
will
tell
of
an
accident
making
repairs
out
in
space
damn
you
if
you
do
want
me
to
kill
you
where
you
stand
come
on
and
fight
garth
you
gone
mad
i
been
waiting
ever
since
i
got
you
to
leave
the
moon
on
guard
with
a
rush
of
anger
i
was
upon
him
he
tried
to
step
back
stumbled
had
one
knee
on
the
ground
then
hurled
himself
forward
with
a
thrust
at
my
waist
that
i
dodged
only
by
an
inch
i
had
to
cover
and
in
spite
of
myself
with
the
cool
work
of
parrying
my
animosity
began
to
disappear
and
so
began
one
of
the
strangest
battles
that
the
universe
has
seen
lumbering
with
our
suits
and
the
extra
gravity
we
circled
each
other
under
the
blazing
sky
the
of
rigel
shimmered
off
our
suits
and
the
arcs
of
our
blades
as
we
cut
and
guarded
each
wary
now
realizing
that
a
touch
meant
death
as
that
terrible
sun
climbed
upward
in
the
sky
its
heat
was
almost
overpowering
the
sweat
poured
off
every
inch
of
my
body
and
i
gasped
for
breath
and
still
we
fought
on
two
glittering
metal
monsters
under
the
big
blue
star
sweeping
up
to
its
noon
i
knew
now
that
i
could
never
kill
garth
i
could
not
go
back
to
kelvar
with
his
blood
yet
if
i
simply
defended
sooner
or
later
he
would
wear
me
down
there
was
just
one
chance
if
i
could
disarm
him
i
could
wrestle
him
into
submission
then
he
might
be
reasonable
or
i
could
take
him
home
bound
i
began
leading
for
the
opening
i
wanted
but
with
no
result
he
seemed
resolved
to
tire
me
out
either
i
must
carry
the
fight
to
him
or
i
would
be
beaten
down
i
made
a
wide
opening
counting
on
dodging
his
slow
stroke
i
did
but
he
recovered
too
soon
again
on
the
other
side
with
no
better
result
still
again
just
getting
in
for
a
light
tap
on
garth
helmet
then
i
stepped
back
with
guard
low
and
this
time
he
came
on
his
sword
rose
in
a
gleaming
arc
and
hung
high
for
a
moment
i
had
him
there
were
sparks
of
clashing
locked
steel
damn
you
dunal
he
took
a
great
step
back
narrowly
keeping
his
balance
on
the
sand
on
another
chance
i
would
trip
him
my
ears
were
almost
deafened
by
his
roar
come
on
and
i
took
a
step
in
and
to
the
side
and
had
him
in
the
sun
he
swung
blindly
trying
to
cover
himself
with
his
whirling
point
but
i
had
half
a
dozen
openings
to
rip
his
suit
when
he
moved
to
try
to
see
i
would
lock
with
him
again
i
watched
his
feet
and
as
i
watched
i
saw
an
incredible
thing
near
one
of
garth
feet
the
sand
was
moving
it
was
not
a
slide
caused
by
his
weight
rather
why
it
was
being
pushed
up
from
below
there
was
a
little
hump
and
suddenly
it
had
burst
open
and
a
stringy
mass
like
seaweed
was
crawling
toward
his
leg
look
out
garth
i
yelled
how
he
could
see
through
that
terrible
sun
i
do
not
know
but
garth
swung
through
my
forgotten
guard
with
a
blow
square
across
my
helmet
glass
the
force
threw
me
to
the
ground
and
i
looked
up
dazed
the
beryllium
glass
had
not
broken
to
let
in
the
air
but
garth
was
standing
over
me
that
your
last
trick
dunal
his
blade
rose
for
the
kill
i
was
unable
even
to
get
up
but
with
one
hand
i
pointed
to
the
ground
look
i
shouted
again
and
on
the
instant
the
thing
wound
itself
around
garth
foot
he
swung
down
hacking
it
loose
i
had
got
to
my
feet
run
for
the
ship
i
cried
and
started
off
not
that
way
i
looked
back
and
saw
that
i
had
run
in
the
wrong
direction
but
it
made
no
difference
over
a
whole
circle
around
us
the
sand
was
rising
and
directly
between
us
and
the
there
was
a
great
mass
we
were
surrounded
we
stood
staring
at
the
creatures
spread
out
to
full
dimensions
each
one
made
a
sphere
about
four
feet
in
diameter
in
the
center
a
solid
mass
whose
outlines
were
difficult
to
discern
and
spreading
out
from
this
a
hundred
long
thin
arms
or
legs
or
branches
or
whatever
one
could
call
them
the
things
were
not
yet
definitely
hostile
only
their
circle
of
perhaps
fifty
yards
radius
grew
continually
thicker
and
more
impenetrable
within
the
enclosed
area
the
only
ripples
we
could
see
in
the
sand
were
heading
outward
there
was
to
be
no
surprise
attack
from
below
at
least
only
one
in
mass
what
i
wondered
might
be
a
sign
of
friendship
to
persuade
them
to
let
us
go
and
then
the
circle
began
to
close
in
the
things
rolled
over
and
over
on
themselves
like
gigantic
tumbleweeds
at
one
point
to
the
right
of
the
direct
route
to
the
the
line
seemed
thinner
i
pointed
the
place
out
to
garth
break
through
there
and
make
a
run
for
it
we
charged
into
the
midst
of
them
with
swinging
blades
the
very
suddenness
of
our
rush
carried
us
through
their
midst
then
something
had
my
legs
from
behind
i
almost
fell
but
succeeded
in
turning
and
cutting
myself
free
the
creatures
from
the
other
side
of
the
circle
must
have
made
the
hundred
yards
in
four
or
five
seconds
and
the
rest
had
now
covered
the
breach
in
front
it
was
hopeless
and
so
we
stood
back
to
back
hewing
out
a
circle
of
protection
against
our
enemies
they
seemed
to
have
no
fear
and
in
spite
of
the
destruction
our
blades
worked
among
them
they
almost
overcame
us
by
sheer
numbers
and
weight
it
was
a
case
of
whirling
our
swords
back
and
forth
interminably
in
the
midst
of
their
tentacles
against
the
light
the
long
arms
were
a
brown
our
swords
broke
them
in
bright
shivers
formed
from
the
predominant
silicon
of
the
planet
the
creatures
were
living
glass
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
in
the
thick
of
them
hewing
until
i
thought
my
arms
must
fall
slashing
and
tearing
at
the
ones
that
had
got
underfoot
and
were
clamping
their
tentacles
around
our
legs
only
for
the
we
should
have
by
this
time
been
overpowered
and
torn
into
bits
and
yet
these
garments
could
not
be
expected
to
hold
indefinitely
but
at
last
there
was
a
breathing
space
the
crippled
front
ranks
dragged
themselves
away
and
there
was
left
around
us
a
brief
area
of
sand
covered
with
coruscating
splinters
of
glass
garth
got
the
breath
to
say
something
or
other
encouraging
it
was
like
old
days
at
school
only
this
time
the
odds
were
all
against
us
we
were
still
a
good
hundred
yards
from
the
and
in
our
path
stood
a
solid
wall
of
the
creatures
even
if
we
got
free
they
could
outrace
us
to
the
goal
and
with
our
limited
strength
we
could
not
hope
to
kill
them
all
in
a
minute
or
two
they
would
attack
us
again
somehow
we
must
fight
our
way
as
long
as
we
lasted
perhaps
they
might
be
frightened
we
threw
ourselves
at
the
side
next
our
goal
the
line
gave
perhaps
a
yard
then
stiffened
and
we
found
ourselves
swallowed
up
in
a
thick
cloud
of
brown
smoke
poison
gas
it
must
be
shot
out
of
their
bodies
at
a
cost
so
great
that
it
was
kept
as
a
last
resort
through
the
rolling
vapor
it
was
just
possible
to
see
our
opponents
but
they
made
no
forward
move
they
were
waiting
for
us
to
be
overcome
suppose
their
compound
could
eat
through
even
our
but
it
did
not
we
were
safe
stand
still
garth
i
whispered
counting
on
the
radio
to
carry
my
voice
let
them
think
we
dead
and
then
give
them
a
surprise
all
right
long
long
minutes
if
only
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
customary
thing
for
a
dead
man
to
fall
slowly
they
began
to
move
in
then
garth
and
i
were
upon
them
they
halted
as
if
stupefied
we
had
hacked
our
way
half
through
their
mass
the
rest
fled
and
we
began
running
toward
the
praying
that
we
might
reach
the
ship
before
they
could
get
organized
again
how
we
floundered
through
the
sand
in
wild
and
desperate
haste
before
we
had
covered
half
the
distance
the
pursuit
began
there
was
no
attempt
to
drag
us
down
directly
but
the
two
wings
raced
past
to
cut
us
off
in
front
at
the
base
of
the
little
cliff
where
the
lay
the
circle
closed
jump
i
called
and
threw
myself
up
over
them
toward
the
stone
garth
would
have
fallen
back
but
i
caught
his
hand
and
pulled
him
to
safety
we
had
won
but
had
we
joined
by
reinforcements
from
somewhere
the
creatures
were
packed
all
around
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
had
begun
to
climb
its
walls
to
cut
us
off
from
the
ship
we
rushed
separately
toward
the
two
sides
and
they
backed
away
but
those
in
front
were
now
established
on
the
top
we
stepped
backward
and
the
whole
line
came
on
but
now
we
turned
and
ran
for
the
we
were
just
able
to
turn
again
and
clear
them
away
with
our
swords
in
a
moment
others
would
be
climbing
up
from
behind
over
the
ship
and
the
door
to
safety
was
on
a
level
with
our
heads
there
was
just
one
chance
stamping
threateningly
we
cleared
the
things
out
for
ten
feet
in
front
of
us
but
once
we
turned
our
backs
for
a
running
start
they
were
at
us
again
boost
you
up
dunal
said
garth
pantingly
no
you
first
but
in
the
midst
of
my
words
he
almost
threw
me
into
the
doorway
i
turned
to
pull
him
up
after
me
they
were
around
his
legs
and
one
had
jumped
down
upon
his
helmet
and
he
must
have
known
it
would
happen
go
back
to
her
he
cried
and
slammed
shut
the
door
there
was
no
time
to
help
him
to
interfere
with
the
way
of
expiation
he
had
chosen
i
tried
to
look
away
but
a
sort
of
fascination
kept
me
watching
him
through
the
glass
he
had
been
dragged
to
his
knees
then
he
was
up
again
whirling
to
keep
them
away
on
all
sides
in
a
mad
gallant
fight
but
the
creatures
knew
it
was
the
kill
now
they
were
around
his
knees
now
up
to
his
waist
in
their
overpowering
mass
it
was
only
a
matter
of
minutes
garth
took
a
staggering
step
backward
dragging
them
all
with
him
he
was
facing
me
and
swung
up
his
sword
in
the
old
lunar
salute
good
luck
dunal
the
words
coming
clearly
over
the
radio
had
a
note
of
exaltation
then
flashing
his
blade
over
his
head
he
hurled
it
into
the
midst
of
the
accursed
things
with
a
tremendous
effort
garth
tore
the
protecting
helmet
from
his
head
and
plunged
backward
over
the
cliff
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
get
in
out
of
the
lock
and
start
for
home
and
little
on
the
trip
is
worthy
of
recounting
without
unsurpassable
difficulty
i
was
able
to
operate
the
machinery
and
steer
first
for
betelguese
then
for
the
sun
counting
on
the
warning
bells
to
arouse
me
i
managed
to
get
in
snatches
of
sleep
at
odd
intervals
at
times
the
strain
of
the
long
watches
was
almost
maddening
by
the
time
the
midpoint
had
been
passed
i
was
living
in
a
sort
of
waking
dream
or
rather
a
state
of
somnambulism
i
ate
my
hands
moved
the
controls
and
yet
all
the
while
my
mind
was
wandering
elsewhere
out
to
garth
body
under
the
blazing
light
of
rigel
back
to
the
moon
and
kelvar
or
else
in
an
unreal
shadowy
world
of
dreams
and
vague
memories
with
perfect
mechanical
accuracy
i
entered
the
solar
system
and
adjusted
the
projectors
for
the
sun
attraction
running
slower
and
slower
i
watched
venus
glide
by
and
then
gradually
everything
faded
and
i
was
walking
along
the
great
nardos
bridge
with
kelvar
the
ocean
was
so
still
that
we
could
see
mirrored
in
it
the
reflection
of
each
white
column
and
our
own
faces
peering
down
and
beyond
that
the
stars
i
shall
bring
you
a
handful
for
your
hair
i
told
her
and
leaned
over
farther
farther
reaching
out
then
i
was
falling
with
face
growing
fainter
and
in
my
ears
a
horrible
ringing
like
the
world
coming
to
an
end
just
before
i
could
strike
the
water
i
wakened
to
find
the
alarm
bell
jangling
and
the
light
flashing
away
through
the
telescope
the
moon
was
large
in
the
sky
it
was
an
hour
perhaps
two
before
i
approached
the
sunlit
surface
and
hovered
over
the
shore
by
nardos
try
as
i
would
my
body
could
not
handle
the
controls
delicately
enough
to
get
the
quite
in
step
with
the
moon
rotation
always
a
little
too
fast
or
too
slow
i
slid
down
until
i
was
only
ten
or
fifteen
feet
off
the
ground
that
seemed
to
be
moving
out
from
under
me
in
another
minute
i
should
be
above
the
water
i
let
everything
go
and
the
fell
there
was
a
thud
a
sound
of
scraping
over
the
sand
a
list
to
one
side
i
thought
for
an
instant
that
the
vessel
was
going
to
turn
over
but
with
the
weight
of
the
reserve
mercury
in
the
fuel
tanks
it
managed
to
right
itself
on
a
slope
of
ten
or
fifteen
degrees
from
the
angle
i
could
barely
see
out
the
windows
and
everything
looked
strange
the
water
under
the
bridge
seemed
too
low
the
earth
had
spots
on
it
and
the
sky
so
dead
with
sleep
that
i
could
scarcely
move
i
managed
to
crane
my
neck
around
to
see
better
there
was
no
sky
only
a
faint
gray
haze
through
which
the
stars
shone
and
yet
the
sun
must
be
shining
i
stretched
still
further
there
the
sun
burned
and
around
it
was
an
unmistakable
corona
it
was
like
airless
space
was
i
dreaming
again
with
a
jerk
i
got
to
my
feet
and
climbed
up
the
sloping
floor
to
the
atmosphere
tester
my
fingers
slipped
off
the
then
turned
it
and
the
needle
scarcely
moved
it
was
true
somehow
as
the
scientists
had
always
told
us
would
be
the
case
eventually
the
air
of
the
moon
with
so
little
gravity
to
hold
it
back
had
evaporated
into
space
but
in
six
months
it
was
unthinkable
surely
someone
had
survived
the
catastrophe
some
people
must
have
been
able
to
keep
themselves
alive
in
caves
where
the
last
of
the
atmosphere
would
linger
kelvar
be
still
alive
i
could
find
her
and
bring
her
to
the
we
would
go
to
some
other
world
frantically
i
pulled
on
my
and
clambered
through
the
i
ran
until
the
cumbersome
suit
slowed
me
down
to
a
staggering
walk
through
the
sand
beside
the
oceanus
procellarum
leaden
and
dull
the
great
sea
lay
undisturbed
by
the
thin
atmosphere
still
remaining
it
had
shrunk
by
evaporation
far
away
from
its
banks
and
where
the
water
once
had
been
there
was
a
dark
incrustation
of
impurities
on
the
land
side
all
was
a
great
white
plain
of
glittering
alkali
without
a
sign
of
vegetation
i
went
on
toward
nardos
the
beautiful
even
from
afar
off
i
could
see
that
it
was
desolate
visible
now
that
the
water
had
gone
down
the
pillars
supporting
it
rose
gaunt
and
skeletal
towers
had
fallen
in
and
the
gleaming
white
was
dimmed
it
was
a
city
of
the
dead
under
an
earth
with
black
spots
where
the
clouds
apparently
had
parted
i
came
nearer
to
nardos
and
the
bridge
nearer
to
the
spot
where
i
had
last
seen
kelvar
below
the
old
water
level
the
columns
showed
a
greenish
stain
and
out
the
whole
structure
had
fallen
in
a
great
gap
i
reached
the
land
terminus
of
the
span
still
glorious
and
almost
beautiful
in
its
ruins
whole
blocks
of
stone
had
fallen
to
the
sand
and
the
adamantine
pillars
were
cracked
and
crumbling
with
the
erosion
of
ages
then
i
knew
in
our
argument
as
to
the
possible
speed
of
the
garth
and
i
had
both
been
right
in
our
reference
frame
the
vessel
had
put
on
an
incredible
velocity
and
covered
the
around
rigel
in
six
months
but
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
moon
it
had
been
unable
to
attain
a
velocity
greater
than
that
of
light
as
the
accelerating
energy
pressed
the
vessel
speed
closer
and
closer
toward
that
limiting
velocity
the
mass
of
the
ship
and
of
its
contents
had
increased
toward
infinity
and
trying
to
move
laboriously
with
such
vast
mass
our
clocks
and
bodies
had
been
slowed
down
until
to
our
leaden
minds
a
year
of
moon
time
became
equivalent
to
several
hours
the
had
attained
an
average
velocity
of
perhaps
miles
per
second
and
the
voyage
that
seemed
to
me
six
months
had
taken
a
thousand
years
a
thousand
years
the
words
went
ringing
through
my
brain
kelvar
had
been
dead
for
a
thousand
years
i
was
alone
in
a
world
uninhabited
for
centuries
i
threw
myself
down
and
battered
my
head
in
the
sand
more
to
achieve
somehow
my
own
peace
of
mind
than
in
any
hope
of
its
being
discovered
i
have
written
this
narrative
there
are
two
copies
this
to
be
placed
in
a
box
at
the
terminus
of
the
bridge
the
other
within
the
comet
one
at
least
should
thus
be
able
to
escape
the
meteors
which
unimpeded
by
the
thin
atmosphere
have
begun
to
strike
everywhere
tearing
up
great
craters
in
the
explosion
that
follows
as
a
result
of
the
impact
my
time
is
nearly
up
air
is
still
plentiful
on
the
but
my
provisions
will
soon
run
short
it
is
now
slightly
over
a
month
since
i
collapsed
on
the
sands
into
merciful
sleep
and
i
possess
food
and
water
for
perhaps
another
but
why
go
on
in
my
terrible
loneliness
sometimes
i
waken
from
a
dream
in
which
they
are
all
so
near
kelvar
garth
all
my
old
companions
and
for
a
moment
i
can
not
realize
how
far
away
they
are
beyond
years
and
years
and
i
trampling
back
and
forth
over
the
dust
of
our
old
life
staring
across
the
waste
waiting
for
what
no
i
shall
wait
only
until
the
dark
when
the
sun
drops
over
the
grimaldi
plateau
i
shall
put
my
manuscripts
in
their
safe
places
then
tear
off
my
helmet
and
join
the
other
two
an
hour
ago
the
bottom
edge
of
the
sun
touched
the
horizon
transcriber
notes
spaced
em
dash
is
found
in
the
original
corrected
from
litle
to
little
not
capitalised
or
italicised
in
the
original
but
should
probably
