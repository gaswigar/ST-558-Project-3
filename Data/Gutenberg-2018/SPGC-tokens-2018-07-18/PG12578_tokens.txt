preface
venice
the
famous
city
in
the
sea
rising
like
enchantment
from
the
waves
of
the
adriatic
appeals
to
the
imagination
through
a
history
replete
with
dramatic
incident
wherein
power
and
revolution
conquest
and
conspiracy
mystery
and
romance
dazzling
splendour
and
judicial
murder
alternate
in
every
page
thirteen
hundred
years
witnessed
the
growth
maturity
and
fall
of
this
once
celebrated
city
commencing
in
the
fifth
century
when
thousands
of
terrified
fugitives
sought
refuge
in
its
numerous
islands
from
the
dreaded
presence
of
attila
and
terminating
when
the
last
of
the
doges
in
lowered
for
ever
the
standard
of
mark
before
the
cannon
of
victorious
buonaparte
venice
was
born
and
died
in
fear
to
every
english
mind
the
queen
of
the
adriatic
is
endeared
by
the
genius
of
our
own
shakespeare
who
that
has
trod
the
great
public
square
with
its
cathedral
has
not
pictured
to
himself
the
forms
of
the
heroic
moor
and
the
gentle
desdemona
who
that
has
landed
from
his
gondola
to
pace
the
rialto
has
not
brought
before
his
mind
eye
the
scowling
brow
of
shylock
when
proposing
the
bond
of
blood
to
his
unsuspecting
victim
shakespeare
may
or
may
not
have
derived
his
plot
of
merchant
of
as
some
suppose
from
two
separate
stories
contained
in
italian
novels
but
if
such
be
the
fact
he
has
so
interwoven
the
double
interest
that
the
two
currents
flow
naturally
into
a
stream
of
unity
in
this
play
shakespeare
has
bequeathed
to
posterity
one
of
his
most
perfect
works
powerful
in
its
effect
and
marvellous
in
its
ingenuity
while
the
language
of
the
jew
is
characterized
by
an
assumption
of
biblical
phraseology
the
appeal
of
portia
to
the
quality
of
mercy
is
invested
with
a
heavenly
eloquence
elevating
the
poet
to
sublimity
from
the
opening
to
the
closing
scene
from
the
moment
when
we
hear
of
the
sadness
prophetic
of
evil
which
depresses
the
spirit
of
antonio
till
we
listen
at
the
last
to
the
playful
prattling
of
two
lovers
in
a
summer
evening
whose
soft
cadences
are
breathed
through
strains
of
music
all
is
a
rapid
succession
of
hope
fear
terror
and
gladness
exciting
our
sympathies
now
for
the
result
of
the
merchant
danger
now
for
the
solution
of
a
riddle
on
which
hangs
the
fate
of
the
wealthy
heiress
and
now
for
the
fugitive
jessica
who
resigns
her
creed
at
the
shrine
of
womanly
affection
in
the
production
of
merchant
of
it
has
been
my
object
to
combine
with
the
poet
art
a
faithful
representation
of
the
picturesque
city
to
render
it
again
palpable
to
the
traveller
who
actually
gazed
upon
the
seat
of
its
departed
glory
and
at
the
same
time
to
exhibit
it
to
the
student
who
has
never
visited
this
once
pleasant
place
of
all
festivity
the
revel
of
the
earth
the
masque
of
italy
the
place
of
mark
with
its
ancient
church
the
rialto
and
its
bridge
the
canals
and
gondolas
the
historic
columns
the
ducal
palace
and
the
council
chamber
are
successively
presented
to
the
spectator
venice
is
with
the
past
affording
truth
to
the
eye
and
reflection
to
the
mind
the
introduction
of
the
princes
of
morocco
and
arragon
at
belmont
hitherto
omitted
is
restored
for
the
purpose
of
more
strictly
adhering
to
the
author
text
and
of
heightening
the
interest
attached
to
the
episode
of
the
caskets
the
costumes
and
customs
are
represented
as
existing
about
the
year
when
shakespeare
wrote
the
play
the
dresses
are
chiefly
selected
from
a
work
by
cesare
vecellio
entitled
degli
habiti
antichi
e
moderni
di
diverse
parti
del
mondo
in
venetia
as
well
as
from
other
sources
to
be
found
in
the
british
museum
whence
i
derive
my
authority
for
the
procession
of
the
doge
in
the
first
scene
if
the
stage
is
to
be
considered
and
upheld
as
an
institution
from
which
instructive
and
intellectual
enjoyment
may
be
derived
it
is
to
shakespeare
we
must
look
as
the
principal
teacher
to
inculcate
its
most
valuable
lessons
it
is
therefore
a
cause
of
that
i
have
on
many
occasions
been
able
successfully
to
present
some
of
the
works
of
the
greatest
dramatic
genius
the
world
has
known
to
more
of
my
countrymen
than
have
ever
witnessed
them
within
the
same
space
of
time
and
let
me
hope
it
will
not
be
deemed
presumptuous
to
record
the
pride
i
feel
at
having
been
so
fortunate
a
medium
between
our
national
poet
and
the
people

how
i
caught
it
found
it
or
came
by
it
what
stuff
is
made
of
whereof
it
is
born
i
am
to
learn
and
such
a
sadness
makes
of
me
that
i
have
much
ado
to
know
myself
your
mind
is
tossing
on
the
ocean
there
where
your
argosies
with
portly
sail
like
signiors
and
rich
burghers
on
the
flood
do
overpeer
the
petty
traffickers
that
to
them
do
them
reverence
as
they
fly
by
them
with
their
woven
wings
believe
me
sir
had
i
such
venture
forth
the
better
part
of
my
affections
would
be
with
my
hopes
abroad
i
should
be
still
plucking
the
grass
to
know
where
sits
the
wind
peering
in
maps
for
ports
and
piers
and
roads
and
every
object
that
might
make
me
fear
misfortune
to
my
ventures
out
of
doubt
would
make
me
sad
my
wind
cooling
my
broth
would
blow
me
to
an
ague
when
i
thought
what
harm
a
wind
too
great
might
do
at
sea
i
should
not
see
the
sandy
run
but
i
should
think
of
shallows
and
of
flats
and
see
my
wealthy
andrew
dock
in
sand
vailing
her
lower
than
her
ribs
to
kiss
her
burial
shall
i
have
the
thought
to
think
on
this
and
shall
i
lack
the
thought
that
such
a
thing
bechanc
would
make
me
sad
but
tell
not
me
i
know
antonio
is
sad
to
think
upon
his
merchandize
believe
me
no
i
thank
my
fortune
for
it
my
ventures
are
not
in
one
bottom
trusted
nor
to
one
place
nor
is
my
whole
estate
upon
the
fortune
of
this
present
year
therefore
my
merchandize
makes
me
not
sad
why
then
you
are
in
love
fie
fie
not
in
love
neither
then
let
us
say
you
are
sad
because
you
are
not
merry
an
as
easy
for
you
to
laugh
and
leap
and
say
you
are
merry
because
you
are
not
sad
here
comes
bassanio
your
most
noble
kinsman
gratiano
and
lorenzo
fare
you
well
we
leave
you
now
with
better
company
i
would
have
staid
till
i
had
made
you
merry
if
worthier
friends
had
not
prevented
me
your
worth
is
very
dear
in
my
regard
i
take
it
your
own
business
calls
on
you
and
you
embrace
the
occasion
to
depart
bassanio
lorenzo
gratiano
good
morrow
my
good
lords
good
signiors
both
when
shall
we
laugh
say
when
you
grow
exceeding
strange
must
it
be
so
we
make
our
leisures
to
attend
on
yours
salarino
salanio
my
lord
bassanio
since
you
have
found
antonio
we
two
will
leave
you
but
at
i
pray
you
have
in
mind
where
we
must
meet
i
will
not
fail
you
you
look
not
well
signor
antonio
you
have
too
much
respect
upon
the
world
they
lose
it
that
do
buy
it
with
much
care
believe
me
you
are
marvellously
chang
i
hold
the
world
but
as
the
world
gratiano
a
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
and
mine
a
sad
one
let
me
play
the
fool
with
mirth
and
laughter
let
old
wrinkles
come
and
let
my
liver
rather
heat
with
wine
than
my
heart
cool
with
mortifying
groans
why
should
a
man
whose
blood
is
warm
within
sit
like
his
grandsire
cut
in
alabaster
sleep
when
he
wakes
and
creep
into
the
jaundice
by
being
peevish
i
tell
thee
what
antonio
i
love
thee
and
it
is
my
love
that
speaks
there
are
a
sort
of
men
whose
visages
do
cream
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
and
do
a
wilful
stillness
entertain
with
purpose
to
be
dress
in
an
opinion
of
wisdom
gravity
profound
conceit
as
who
should
say
am
sir
when
i
ope
my
lips
let
no
dog
bark
o
my
antonio
i
do
know
of
these
that
therefore
only
are
reputed
wise
for
saying
nothing
when
i
am
very
sure
if
they
should
speak
almost
damn
those
ears
which
hearing
them
would
call
their
brothers
fools
i
tell
thee
more
of
this
another
time
but
fish
not
with
this
melancholy
bait
for
this
fool
gudgeon
this
opinion
come
good
lorenzo
fare
ye
well
a
while
i
end
my
exhortation
after
dinner
well
we
will
leave
you
then
till
i
must
be
one
of
these
same
dumb
wise
men
for
gratiano
never
lets
me
speak
well
keep
me
company
but
two
years
more
thou
shalt
not
know
the
sound
of
thine
own
tongue
farewell
i
grow
a
talker
for
this
gear
thanks
for
silence
is
only
commendable
in
a
neat
tongue
dried
and
a
maid
not
vendible
gratiano
lorenzo
is
that
any
thing
now
gratiano
speaks
an
infinite
deal
of
nothing
more
than
any
man
in
all
venice
his
reasons
are
as
two
grains
of
wheat
hid
in
two
bushels
of
chaff
you
shall
seek
all
day
ere
you
find
them
and
when
you
have
them
they
are
not
worth
the
search
well
tell
me
now
what
lady
is
the
same
to
whom
you
swore
a
secret
pilgrimage
that
you
promis
to
tell
me
of
is
not
unknown
to
you
antonio
how
much
i
have
disabled
mine
estate
by
something
showing
a
more
swelling
port
than
my
faint
means
would
grant
continuance
to
you
antonio
i
owe
the
most
in
money
and
in
love
and
from
your
love
i
have
a
warranty
to
unburthen
all
my
plots
and
purposes
how
to
get
clear
of
all
the
debts
i
owe
i
pray
you
good
bassanio
let
me
know
it
and
if
it
stand
as
you
yourself
still
do
within
the
eye
of
honour
be
my
purse
my
person
my
extremest
means
lie
all
unlock
to
your
occasions
in
my
when
i
had
lost
one
shaft
i
shot
his
fellow
of
the
flight
the
way
with
more
advised
watch
to
find
the
other
forth
and
by
adventuring
both
i
oft
found
both
i
urge
this
childhood
proof
because
what
follows
is
pure
innocence
i
owe
you
much
and
like
a
wasteful
youth
that
which
i
owe
is
lost
but
if
you
please
to
shoot
another
arrow
that
self
way
which
you
did
shoot
the
first
i
do
not
doubt
as
i
will
watch
the
aim
or
to
find
both
or
bring
your
latter
hazard
back
again
and
thankfully
rest
debtor
for
the
first
you
know
me
well
and
herein
spend
but
time
to
wind
about
my
love
with
circumstance
then
do
but
say
to
me
what
i
should
do
that
in
your
knowledge
may
by
me
be
done
and
i
am
prest
unto
it
therefore
speak

belmont

a
lady
richly
left
and
she
is
fair
and
fairer

that
word
of
virtues
sometimes
from

did
receive
fair
speechless
messages
her
name
is
portia
nothing
undervalued

cato

is
the
wide

her

renowned
suitors

my

but
the
means
to
hold
a
rival

with
one
of
them

such
thrift
that
i
should
questionless
be
fortunate
thou
that
all
my
fortunes
are
at

to
the
uttermost

furnish
thee

go

and
well
pronounced
they
would
be
better
if
well
followed
if
to
do
were
as
easy
as
to
know
what
were
good
to
do
chapels
had
been

it
is
a
good
divine
that
follows
his
own
instructions
i
can
easier
teach
twenty
what
were
good
to
be
done
than
be
one
of
the
twenty
to
follow
mine
own
teaching
but
this
reasoning
is
not
in
the
fashion
to
choose
me
a
husband
o
me
the
word
choose
i
may
neither
choose
whom
i
would
nor
refuse
whom
i
dislike
so
is
the
will
of
a
living
daughter
curb
by
the
will
of
a
dead
father
is
it
not
hard
nerissa
that
i
can
not
choose
one
nor
refuse
none
your
father
was
ever
virtuous
and
holy
men
at
their
death
have
good
inspirations
therefore
the
lottery
that
he
hath
devised
in
these
three
chests
of
gold
silver
and
lead
whereof
who
chooses
his
meaning
chooses
you
will
no
doubt
never
be
chosen
by
any
rightly
but
one
who
you
shall
rightly
love
but
what
warmth
is
there
in
your
affection
towards
any
of
these
princely
suitors
that
are
already
come
i
pray
thee
them
and
as
thou
namest
them
i
will
describe
them
and
according
to
my
description
level
at
my
affection
first
there
is
the
neapolitan
prince
ay
that
a
colt
indeed
for
he
doth
nothing
but
talk
of
his
horse
and
he
makes
it
a
great
approbation
of
his
own
good
parts
that
he
can
shoe
him
himself
then
is
there
the
county
palatine
he
doth
nothing
but
frown
as
who
should
say
you
will
not
have
me
choose
he
hears
merry
tales
and
smiles
not
i
fear
he
will
prove
the
weeping
philosopher
when
he
grows
old
being
so
full
of
unmannerly
sadness
in
his
youth
i
had
rather
to
be
married
to
a
head
with
a
bone
in
his
mouth
than
to
either
of
these
heaven
defend
me
from
these
two
how
say
you
by
the
french
lord
monsieur
le
bon
heaven
made
him
and
therefore
let
him
pass
for
a
man
how
like
you
the
young
german
the
duke
of
saxony
nephew
very
vilely
in
the
morning
when
he
is
sober
and
most
vilely
in
the
afternoon
when
he
is
drunk
when
he
is
best
he
is
a
little
worse
than
a
man
and
when
he
is
worst
he
is
little
better
than
a
beast
an
the
worst
fall
that
ever
fell
i
hope
i
shall
make
shift
to
go
without
him
if
he
should
offer
to
choose
and
choose
the
right
casket
you
should
refuse
to
perform
your
father
will
if
you
should
refuse
to
accept
him
therefore
for
fear
of
the
worst
i
pray
thee
set
a
deep
glass
of
rhenish
wine
on
the
contrary
casket
for
if
the
devil
be
within
and
that
temptation
without
i
know
he
will
choose
it
you
need
not
fear
lady
the
having
any
of
these
lords
they
have
acquainted
me
with
their
determinations
which
is
indeed
to
return
to
their
home
and
to
trouble
you
with
no
more
suit
unless
you
may
be
won
by
some
other
sort
than
your
father
imposition
depending
on
the
caskets
i
am
glad
this
parcel
of
wooers
are
so
reasonable
for
there
is
not
one
among
them
but
i
dote
on
his
very
absence
and
i
wish
them
a
fair
departure
do
you
not
remember
lady
in
your
father
time
a
venetian
a
scholar
and
a
soldier
that
came
hither
in
company
of
the
marquis
of
montferrat
yes
yes
it
was
bassanio
as
i
think
so
was
he
called
true
madam
he
of
all
the
men
that
ever
my
foolish
eyes
looked
upon
was
the
best
deserving
a
fair
lady
i
remember
him
well
and
i
remember
him
worthy
of
thy
how
now
what
news
balthazar
the
four
strangers
seek
you
madam
to
take
their
leave
and
there
is
a
come
from
a
fifth
the
prince
of
morocco
who
brings
word
the
prince
his
master
will
be
here
if
i
could
bid
the
fifth
welcome
with
so
good
heart
as
i
can
bid
the
other
four
farewell
i
should
be
glad
of
his
approach
come
nerissa

go
before
whiles
we
shut
the
gate
upon
one
wooer
another
knocks
at

bassanio
aside
how
like
a
fawning
publican
he
looks

hate
him

he
is
a
christian

more
for
that
in
low
simplicity
he
lends
out
money
gratis
and
brings
down
the
rate
of
usance
here
with
us
in

e
if
i
can
catch
him
once
upon

hip
i
will
feed
fat
the
ancient
grudge
i
bear
him
he
hates
our
sacred
nation
and
he
rails
even
there
where
merchants
most
do
congregate
on
me
my
bargains
and
my
thrift
which
he
calls

cursed
be
my

shylock
do
you
hear
i
am
debating

my
present
store
and
by

near
guess
of
my
memory
i
can
not
instantly
raise
up
the
gross
of
full
three
thousand
ducats
what
of
that
tubal
a
wealthy
hebrew
of
my
tribe
will
furnish
me
but
soft
how
many
months
do
you
desire
rest
you
fair
good
signior
to
antonio
your
worship
was
the
last
man
in
our
mouths
shylock
albeit
i
neither
lend
nor
borrow
by
taking
nor
by
giving
of
excess
yet
to
supply
the
ripe
wants
of
my
friend
i
break
a
custom
he
yet
possess
how
much
you
would
ay
ay
three
thousand
ducats
and
for
three
months
i
had
forgot
three
months
you
told
me
so
well
then
your
bond
and
let
me
see
but
hear
you
methought
you
said
you
neither
lend
nor
borrow
upon
advantage
i
do
never
use
it
when
jacob
graz
his
uncle
laban
sheep
this
jacob
from
our
holy
abraham
was
as
his
wise
mother
wrought
in
his
behalf
the
third
possessor
ay
he
was
the
third
and
what
of
him
did
he
take
interest
no
not
take
interest
not
as
you
would
say
directly
interest
mark
what
jacob
did
when
laban
and
himself
were

all
the
eanlings
which
were
streak
and
pied
should
fall
as
jacob
hire
the
skilful
shepherd
peel
me
certain
wands
and
in
the
doing
of
the
deed
of
kind
he
stuck
them
up
before
the
fulsome
ewes
who
then
conceiving
did
in
fall
lambs
and
those
were
jacob
this
was
a
way
to
thrive
and
he
was
blest
and
thrift
is
blessing
if
men
steal
it
not
this
was
a
venture
sir
that
jacob
serv
for
a
thing
not
in
his
power
to
bring
to
pass
but
sway
and
fashion
by
the
hand
of
heaven
was
this
inserted
to
make
interest

historical
notes
to
act
first
a
the
foundation
of
venice
is
attributed
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
districts
who
fled
from
the
cruelty
of
attila
king
of
the
huns
and
took
refuge
among
the
islets
at
the
mouth
of
the
brenta
here
about
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
they
founded
two
small
towns
called
rivoalto
and
malmocco
and
being
in
a
manner
shut
out
from
all
other
modes
of
employment
naturally
devoted
themselves
to
commerce
in
this
way
they
soon
became
prosperous
and
their
numbers
increased
so
rapidly
that
in
the
year
they
made
application
to
the
emperor
to
be
elected
into
a
body
politic
and
obtained
authority
to
elect
a
chief
to
whom
they
gave
the
name
of
duke
or
doge
the
town
continuing
to
increase
gradually
extended
its
buildings
to
the
adjacent
islands
and
at
the
same
time
acquired
considerable
tracts
of
territory
on
the
mainland
then
inhabited
by
the
veneti
from
whence
the
rising
city
is
supposed
to
have
borrowed
its
name
of
venetia
or
venice
b
this
is
the
heart
of
venice
and
is
one
of
the
most
imposing
architectural
objects
in
europe
three
of
the
sides
are
occupied
by
ranges
of
lofty
buildings
which
are
connected
by
a
succession
of
covered
walk
or
arcades
the
church
of
st
mark
founded
in
the
year
closes
up
the
square
on
the
east
the
lofty
campanile
or
over
feet
in
height
was
begun
and
finished
in
in
the
reign
of
justiniani
participazio
the
son
and
successor
of
angelo
undistinguished
by
events
of
more
important
character
the
venetians
became
possessed
of
the
relics
of
that
saint
to
whom
they
ever
afterwards
appealed
as
the
great
patron
of
their
state
and
city
these
remains
were
obtained
from
alexandria
by
a
pious
stratagem
at
a
time
when
the
church
wherein
they
were
originally
deposited
was
about
to
be
destroyed
in
order
that
its
rich
marbles
might
be
applied
to
the
decoration
of
a
palace
at
that
fortunate
season
some
venetian
ships
it
is
said
no
less
than
ten
a
fact
proving
the
prosperous
extent
of
their
early
commerce
happened
to
be
trading
in
that
port
and
their
captains
though
not
without
much
difficulty
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
the
priests
who
had
the
custody
of
the
holy
treasure
its
deliverance
into
their
hands
in
order
that
it
might
escape
profanation
it
was
necessary
however
that
this
transfer
should
be
made
in
secrecy
for
we
are
assured
by
sabellico
who
relates
the
occurrence
minutely
that
the
miracles
which
had
been
daily
wrought
at
the
saint
shrine
had
strongly
attached
the
populace
to
his
memory
the
priests
carefully
opened
the
cerements
in
which
the
body
was
enveloped
and
considering
doubtless
that
one
dead
saint
possessed
no
less
intrinsic
virtue
and
value
than
another
they
very
adroitly
substituted
the
corpse
of
a
female
sta
claudia
in
the
folds
which
had
been
occupied
by
that
of
mark
but
they
had
widely
erred
in
their
graduation
of
the
scale
of
beatitude
so
great
was
the
odour
of
superior
sanctity
that
a
rich
perfume
diffused
itself
through
the
church
at
the
moment
at
which
the
of
the
evangelist
were
disturbed
and
the
holy
robbery
was
well
nigh
betrayed
to
the
eager
crowd
of
worshippers
who
attracted
by
the
sweet
smell
thronged
to
inspect
the
relics
and
to
ascertain
their
safety
after
examination
they
retired
satisfied
that
their
favourite
saint
was
inviolate
for
the
slit
which
the
priests
had
made
in
his
cerements
was
behind
and
out
of
sight
but
the
venetians
still
had
to
protect
the
embarkation
of
their
prize
for
this
purpose
effectually
to
prevent
all
chance
of
search
they
placed
the
body
in
a
large
basket
stuffed
with
herbs
and
covered
with
joints
of
pork
the
porters
who
bore
it
were
instructed
to
cry
loudly
khanzir
and
every
true
mussulman
whom
they
met
carefully
avoided
the
uncleanness
with
which
he
was
threatened
by
contact
with
this
forbidden
flesh
even
when
once
on
board
the
body
was
not
yet
quite
safe
for
accident
might
reveal
the
contents
of
the
basket
it
was
therefore
wrapt
in
one
of
the
sails
and
hoisted
to
a
of
the
till
the
moment
of
departure
nor
was
this
precaution
unnecessary
for
the
unbelievers
instituted
a
strict
search
for
contraband
goods
before
the
vessel
sailed
during
the
voyage
the
ship
was
in
danger
from
a
violent
storm
and
but
for
the
timely
appearance
of
the
saint
who
warned
the
captain
to
furl
his
sails
she
would
inevitably
have
been
lost
the
joy
of
the
venetians
on
the
arrival
of
this
precious
cargo
was
manifested
by
feasting
music
processions
and
prayers
an
ancient
tradition
was
called
to

mark
in
his
travels
had
visited
aquileia
and
having
touched
also
at
the
hundred
isles
at
that
time
uninhabited
had
been
informed
in
a
prophetic
vision
that
his
bones
should
one
day
repose
upon
their
shores
venice
was
solemnly
consigned
to
his
protection
the
saint
himself
or
his
lion
was
blazoned
on
her
standards
and
impressed
on
her
coinage

shout
of
the
populace

on
occasions
of
sedition

of
joy

cry

i
reason
with
a
frenchman
yesterday
who
told
me
that
antonio
hath
a
ship
of
rich
lading
on
the
narrow
seas
that
part
the
french
and
english
the
goodwins
i
think
they
call
the
place
a
very
dangerous
flat
and
fatal
where
the
carcases
of
many
a
tall
ship
lie
buried
as
they
say
if
my

would
she
were
as
lying
a

in

as
ever
ginger

made
her

believe
she
wept
for
the
death
of
a
third
husband
but
it
is
true
that
the
good
antonio
the
honest
antonio
o
that
i
had
a
title
good
enough
to
keep
his
name
company
come
the
full
stop
why
the
end
is
he
hath
lost
a
ship
i
would
it
might
prove
the
end
of
his
losses
let
me
say
amen
betimes
lest
the
devil
cross
my
prayer
for
here
he
comes
in
the
likeness
of
a

shylock
how
now

you
knew
none

you

i
for

knew
the

that
made
the
wings
she
flew
withal
and
shylock
for
his
own
part
knew
the

was
fledg

then
it
is
the
complexion
of
them
all
to
leave

she
is

now
this

these
servants
and
this

myself
are
yours

give

this
ring
which
when
you
part
from
lose
or
give
away
let
it
presage
the
ruin
of
your
love
and
be
my
vantage
to
exclaim
on
you
madam
you
have
bereft
me
of
all
words
only
my
blood
speaks
to
you
in
my
veins
but
when
this
ring
parts
from
this
finger
then
parts
life
from
hence
o
then
be
bold
to
say
bassanio
dead
my
lord

it
is

our

when
your
honours
mean
to
solemnize
the
bargain
of
your

i
do
beseech
you
even
at
that
time
i
may
be
married

with
all
my
heart
so
thou
canst
get
a

mine
too

was
dry
with

got

promise
of
this
fair
one
here
to
have
her

provided
that
your

her
mistress

paper
that
steal
the
colour
from
bassanio
cheek
some
dear
friend
dead
else
nothing
in
the
world
could
turn
so
much
the
constitution
of
any
constant
man
what
worse
and
worse
with
leave
bassanio
i
am
half
yourself
and

must
freely
have
the
half
of
any
thing
that
this
same
paper
brings
you
o
sweet
portia
here
are
a
few
of
the
words
that
ever
blotted
paper
gentle

did
first
impart
my
love
to
you
i
freely
told
you
all
the
wealth
i
had
ran
in
my
veins
i
was
a
gentleman
and
then
i
told
you
true
and
yet
dear
lady
rating
myself
at
nothing
you
shall
see
how
much
i
was
a
braggart
when
i
told
you
my
state
was
nothing
i
should
then
have
told
you
that
i
was
worse
than
nothing

engag
myself

a
dear
friend
engag
my

a
letter

the
paper
as
the
body
of
my
friend
and
every
word
in
it
a
gaping
wound
issuing
but
is
it
true
solanio
have
all
his
ventures
fail
what
not
one
hit
from
tripolis
from
mexico
and
england
from
lisbon
barbary
and
india
and
not
one
vessel
the
dreadful
touch
of
rocks
not
one
my
lord
besides
it
should
appear
that
if
he
had
the
present
money
to
discharge
the
jew
he
would
not
take
it
never
did
i
know
a

so
keen

greedy
to
confound
a
man
he
plies
the
duke
at
morning
and
at
night

doth
impeach
the
freedom
of
the
state
if

these

which

on

near
the
doge
palace
were
among
the
trophies
brought
by
dominico
michieli
on
his
victorious
return
from
palestine
in

it
is
believed
that
they
were
plundered
from
some

accompanied
them
was
sunk

long
before
any

could
be
found
sufficiently
enterprising
to
attempt
to
rear
them

undertook
the

and
succeeded
of
the
process
which
he
employed
we
are
uninformed
for
sabellico
records
no
more
than
that
he
took
especial
pains
to
keep
the
ropes
continually
wetted
while
they
were
strained
by
the
weight
of
the
huge
marbles
the
government
more
in
the
lavish
spirit
of
oriental
bounty
than
in
accordance
with
the
calculating
sobriety
of
european
patronage
had
promised
to
reward
the
architect
by
granting
whatever
boon
consistent
with
its
honour
he
might
ask
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
quite
strictly
adhered
to
the
requisite
condition
when
he
demanded
that
games
of
chance
hitherto
forbidden
throughout
the
capital
might
be
played
in
the
space
between
the
columns
perhaps
with
a
reservation
to
himself
of
any
profits
accruing
from
them
his
request
was
granted
and
the
disgraceful
monopoly
became
established
but
afterward
in
order
to
render
the
spot
infamous
and
to
deter
the
population
from
frequenting
it
it
was
made
the
scene
of
capital
executions

malefactors

with

the

the
unacquaintance
of
the

symbolical
that
their
great
council
never
undertakes
a
war
of
its
own
accord

for
any
other
object
than
to
obtain
a
good

secure

satirist
has
unintentionally
given
the

the
highest
praise
which
could
flow
from

it
have

for

if

had
never

us

that
the

exchanged
the

for
that

my

greets
your

a
why
dost

earnestly
to

the
forfeit
from
that
bankrupt
there
can
no
prayers
pierce
thee
no
none
that
thou
hast
wit
enough
to
make
o
be
thou
damn
inexorable
dog
and
for
thy
life
let
justice
be
accus
thou
almost
makst
me
waver
in
my
faith
to
hold
opinion
with
pythagoras
that
souls
of
animals
infuse
themselves
into
the
trunks
of
men
thy
currish
spirit
govern
a
wolf
who
hang
for
human
slaughter
even
from
the
gallows
did
his
fell
soul
fleet
and
whilst
thou
in
thy
unhallow
dam
infus
itself
in
thee
for
thy
desires
are
wolfish
bloody
starv
and
ravenous
till
thou
rail
the
seal
from
off
my
bond
thou
but
thy
lungs
to
speak
so
loud
repair
thy
wit
good
youth
or
it
will
fall
to
cureless
i
stand
here
for
law
this
letter
from
bellario
doth
commend
a
young
and
learned
doctor
tax
our
court
where
is
he
he
attendeth
here
hard
by
to
know
your
answer
whether
you
admit
him
with
all
my
heart
some
three
or
four
of
you
go
give
him
courteous
conduct
to
this
meantime
the
court
shall
hear
bellario
letter
your
grace
shall
understand
that
at
the
receipt
of
your
letter
i
am
very
sick
but
that
in
the
instant
that
your
messenger
came
in
loving
visitation
was
with
me
a
young
doctor
of
home
his
name
is
balthasar
i
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
in
controversy
between
the
jew
and
antonio
the
merchant
we
turned
many
books
together
he
is
furnished
with
my
opinion
which
better
with
his
own
learning
the
greatness
whereof
i
can
not
enough
commend
comes
with
him
at
my
importunity
to
fill
up
your
grace
request
in
my
stead
i
beseech
you
let
his
lack
of
years
be
no
impediment
to
let
him
lack
a
reverend
estimation
for
i
never
knew
so
young
a
body
with
so
old
a
head
i
leave
him
to
your
gracious
acceptance
whose
trial
shall
better
publish
his
commendation
you
hear
the
learn
bellario
what
he
writes
and
here
i
take
it
is
the
doctor
come
portia
like
a
doctor
of
give
me
your
hand
came
you
from
old
bellario
i
did
my
lord
you
are
welcome
take
your
place
are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
that
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
i
am
informed
throughly
of
the
cause
which
is
the
merchant
here
and
which
the
jew
antonio
and
old
shylock
both
stand
forth
is
your
name
shylock
shylock
is
my
name
of
a
strange
nature
is
the
suit
you
follow
yet
in
such
rule
that
the
venetian
law
can
not
impugn
you
as
you
do
you
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
antonio
ay
so
he
says
so
you
confess
the
bond
i
do
then
must
the
jew
be
merciful
on
what
compulsion
must
i
tell
me
that
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strain
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
bless
it
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown
his
sceptre
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power
the
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty
wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings
but
mercy
is
above
this
sceptred
sway
it
is
enthroned
in
the
hearts
of
kings
it
is
an
attribute
to
god
himself
and
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
when
mercy
seasons
justice
therefore
jew
though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
should
see
salvation
we
do
pray
for
mercy
and
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
the
deeds
of
mercy
i
have
spoke
thus
much
to
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea
which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
court
of
venice
must
needs
give
sentence
the
merchant
there
my
deeds
upon
my
head
i
crave
the
law
the
penalty
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
is
he
not
able
to
discharge
the
money
yes
here
i
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
yea
thrice
the
sum
if
that
will
not
suffice
i
will
be
bound
to
pay
it
ten
times
on
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
if
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appear
that
malice
bears
down
truth
and
i
beseech
you
wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
to
do
a
great
right
to
do
a
little
wrong
and
curb
this
cruel
devil
of
his
will
it
must
not
be
there
is
no
power
in
venice
can
alter
a
decree
established
be
recorded
for
a
precedent
and
many
an
error
by
the
same
example
will
rush
into
the
state
it
can
not
be
a
daniel
come
to
judgment
yea
a
daniel
o
wise
young
judge
how
do
i
honour
thee
i
pray
you
let
me
look
upon
the
bond
here
is
most
reverend
doctor
here
it
is
shylock
there
thrice
thy
money
offer
thee
an
oath
an
oath
i
have
an
oath
in
heaven
shall
i
lay
perjury
upon
my
soul
no
not
for
venice
why
this
bond
is
forfeit
and
lawfully
by
this
the
jew
may
claim
a
pound
of
flesh
to
be
by
him
cut
off
nearest
the
merchant
heart
be
merciful
take
thrice
thy
money
bid
me
tear
the
bond
when
it
is
paid
according
to
the
tenour
it
doth
appear
you
are
a
worthy
judge
you
know
the
law
your
exposition
hath
been
most
sound
i
charge
you
by
the
law
whereof
you
are
a
pillar
proceed
to
judgment
by
my
soul
i
swear
there
is
no
power
in
the
tongue
of
man
to
alter
me
i
stay
here
on
my
bond
most
heartily
i
do
beseech
the
court
to
give
the
judgment
why
then
thus
it
is
you
must
prepare
your
bosom
for
his
knife
o
noble
judge
o
excellent
young
man
for
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
law
hath
full
relation
to
the
penalty
which
here
appeareth
due
upon
the
bond
is
very
true
o
wise
and
upright
judge
how
much
more
elder
art
thou
than
thy
looks
therefore
lay
bare
your
bosom
ay
his
breast
so
says
the
bond
doth
it
not
noble
judge
nearest
his
heart
those
are
the
very
words

is
so

here
to
weigh
the
flesh

have
them
ready

by
some
surgeon
shylock
on
your
charge
to
stop
his
wounds
lest
he
should
bleed
to
death
is
it
so
nominated
in
the
bond
it
is
not
so
express
but
what
of
that
good

much
for
charity

herself
more
kind
than

is
still
her
use
to
let
the
wretched
man
outlive
his
wealth
to
view
with
hollow
eye
and
wrinkled
brow
an
age
of
poverty

of

touch
their

you
shall
perceive
them
make
a
mutual
stand
their
savage
eyes
turn

you
do
take

already
what
the
matter
about
a

of
gold
a
paltry
ring
that
she
did
give
to
me
whose
posy
was
for
all
the
world
like
cutler
poetry
upon
a
knife
me
and
leave
me
what
talk
you
of
the
posy
or
the
value
you
swore
to
me
when
i
did
give
it
you
that
you
would
wear
it
till
the
hour
of
death
and
that
it
should
lie
with
you
in
your
grave
though
not
for
me
yet
for
your
vehement
oaths
you
should
have
been
respective
and
have
kept
it
gave
it
a
judge
clerk
but
well
i
know
the
clerk
will
wear
hair
on
face
that
had
it
he
will
an
if
he
live
to
be
a
man
ay
if
a
woman
live
to
be
a
man
now
by
this
hand
i
gave
it
to
a
youth
kind
of
boy
a
little
scrubbed
boy
no
higher
than
thyself
the
judge
clerk
a
prating
boy
that
begg
it
as
a
fee
i
could
not
for
my
heart
deny
it
him
you
were
to
blame
i
must
be
plain
with
you
to
part
so
slightly
with
your
wife
first
gift
a
thing
stuck
on
with
oaths
upon
your
finger
and
so
riveted
with
faith
unto
your
flesh
i
gave
my
love
a
ring
and
made
him
swear
never
to
part
with
it
and
here
he
stands
i
dare
be
sworn
for
him
he
would
not
leave
it
nor
pluck
it
from
his
finger
for
the
wealth
that
the
world
masters
now
in
faith
gratiano
you
give
your
wife
too
unkind
a
cause
of
grief
an
to
me
i
should
be
mad
at
it
why
i
were
best
to
cut
my
left
hand
off
and
swear
i
lost
the
ring
defending
it
my
lord
bassanio
gave
his
ring
away
unto
the
judge
that
begg
it
and
indeed
deserv
it
too
and
then
the
boy
his
clerk
that
took
some
pains
in
writing
he
begg
mine
and
neither
man
nor
master
would
take
aught
but
the
two
rings
what
ring
gave
you
my
lord
not
that
i
hope
which
you
receiv
of
me
if
i
could
add
a
lie
unto
a
fault
i
would
deny
it
but
you
see
my
finger
hath
not
the
ring
upon
it
it
is
gone
even
so
void
is
your
false
heart
of
truth
by
heaven
i
will
come
in
your
sight
until
i
see
the
ring
nor
i
in
yours
till
i
again
see
mine
sweet
portia
if
you
did
know
to
whom
i
gave
the
ring
if
you
did
know
for
whom
i
gave
the
ring
and
would
conceive
for
what
i
gave
the
ring
and
how
unwillingly
i
left
the
ring
when
nought
would
be
accepted
but
the
ring
you
would
abate
the
strength
of
your
displeasure
if
you
had
known
the
virtue
of
the
ring
or
half
her
worthiness
that
gave
the
ring
or
your
own
honour
to
contain
the
ring
you
would
not
then
have
parted
with
the
ring
what
man
is
there
so
much
unreasonable
if
you
had
pleas
to
have
defended
it
with
any
terms
of
zeal
wanted
the
modesty
to
urge
the
thing

as
a

a
contraction
of
interrogatories
the
end
at
a
very
early
period
venice
had
begun
to
trade
with
constantinople
and
the
levant
and
though
subjected
to
formidable
competition
from
the
pisans
and
genoese
succeeded
in
engrossing
the
far
largest
share
of
the
traffic
of
the
east
the
crusades
now
commenced
and
giving
lucrative
employment
to
their
shipping
in
the
conveyance
of
troops
and
the
munitions
of
war
greatly
increased
both
their
wealth
and
power
and
enabled
them
to
make
large
additions
to
their
territory
in
early
times
the
doges
had
been
elected
by
the
popular
voice
and
held
their
office
by
a
very
precarious
tenure
for
in
the
case
of
any
reverse
or
general
dissatisfaction
from
any
other
cause
they
were
not
only
deposed
but
often
lost
their
lives
either
by
open
violence
or
assassination
the
disorders
thus
occasioned
rose
to
such
a
height
in
the
century
that
a
change
in
the
form
of
government
became
necessary
for
this
purpose
the
city
was
divided
into
six
districts
each
of
which
nominated
two
delegates
or
twelve
in
all
these
twelve
nominated
representatives
who
concentrated
in
themselves
all
the
powers
which
had
been
previously
exercised
by
the
popular
assemblies
at
the
same
time
a
senate
was
appointed
and
the
doge
was
provided
with
a
council
of
six
who
were
nominally
to
assist
but
if
so
disposed
could
easily
find
means
to
thwart
him
the
representatives
formed
the
grand
council
and
receiving
their
appointments
annually
from
delegates
chosen
by
the
popular
voice
continued
in
fact
notwithstanding
the
change
in
form
to
be
dependent
upon
it
the
next
change
however
set
them
free
after
a
severe
struggle
the
in
succeeded
in
making
their
office
hereditary
and
thus
converted
what
had
previously
been
a
democracy
into
one
of
the
most
rigid
forms
of
aristocracy
the
evils
of
the
system
soon
developed
themselves
the
now
hereditary
nobles
became
as
jealous
of
each
other
as
they
had
formerly
been
of
the
people
and
while
appropriating
all
the
great
offices
of
the
state
had
recourse
to
various
methods
many
of
them
of
the
most
despotic
nature
to
prevent
anyone
of
the
great
families
from
acquiring
a
preponderating
influence
among
these
arrangements
was
the
institution
of
a
council
of
selected
from
the
grand
council
and
subsequently
in
the
selection
of
three
state
inquisitors
from
the
council
of
these
inquisitors
in
whom
all
the
powers
of
the
state
were
absolutely
vested
justified
the
name
which
the
cruel
bigotry
of
the
romish
church
has
established
this
rigid
despotism
had
however
the
effect
of
giving
a
stern
unity
of
purpose
to
the
proceedings
of
government
and
doubtless
contributed
in
some
degree
to
consolidate
the
various
accessions
of
territory
which
had
been
made
into
one
whole
at
this
period
the
venetians
were
masters
of
the
coast
of
dalmatia
and
the
islands
of
cyprus
candia
and
a
great
part
of
the
morea
and
had
almost
monopolized
the
trade
of
egypt
and
the
east
the
first
great
attempt
to
humble
venice
was
made
in
the
beginning
of
the
century
when
the
famous
league
of
cambrai
of
which
pope
julius
the
second
was
the
real
author
though
the
emperor
of
germany
and
the
kings
of
france
and
spain
were
parties
to
it
was
framed
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
completely
subduing
her
and
partitioning
her
territories
dissensions
among
the
confederates
more
than
her
own
valour
saved
her
from
destruction
but
not
before
most
of
her
possessions
on
the
mainland
had
been
wrested
from
her
a
still
heavier
blow
at
her
prosperity
was
struck
by
the
discovery
of
a
new
passage
to
the
east
which
carried
its
rich
traffic
into
new
channels
and
dried
up
one
of
the
main
sources
of
her
wealth
and
strength
the
work
of
destruction
was
all
but
completed
by
the
turks
who
engaged
her
in
an
expensive
and
ruinous
warfare
during
which
she
lost
the
morea
the
islands
of
cyprus
and
candia
and
with
them
the
ascendancy
which
she
had
long
possessed
in
the
levant
from
all
these
causes
her
decline
proved
as
rapid
as
her
rise
had
been
and
though
her
position
can
hardly
fail
to
give
her
a
considerable
coasting
trade
all
her
maritime
greatness
has
departed
and
apparently
the
highest
destiny
to
which
she
can
now
aspire
is
that
of
being
a
valuable
dependency
to
some
superior
power
