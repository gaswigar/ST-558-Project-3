i
how
i
came
to
the
pines
is
the
discomfort
of
the
thing
which
comes
back
upon
me
i
believe
most
forcibly
of
course
it
was
horrible
too
emphatically
horrible
but
the
prolonged
sustained
baffling
discomfort
of
my
position
is
what
has
left
the
mark
the
growing
suspicion
the
uncanny
circumstances
my
long
knowledge
of
that
presence
it
is
all
extraordinary
not
least
the
part
i
somehow
managed
to
play
i
was
housekeeper
at
the
time
for
little
brane
how
i
had
come
to
be
her
housekeeper
might
have
served
to
forewarn
me
if
i
had
had
the
clue
none
but
an
inexperienced
desperate
girl
would
have
taken
the
position
after
the
fashion
in
which
i
was
urged
to
take
it
i
remember
the
raw
colorless
day
and
how
it
made
me
shiver
to
face
its
bitter
grayness
as
i
came
out
of
the
dismal
new
york
boardinghouse
to
begin
my
dreary
mortifying
search
for
work
i
remember
the
hollowness
of
purse
and
stomach
and
the
dullness
of
head
i
even
remember
wondering
that
hair
like
mine
so
conspiculously
could
possibly
keep
its
flame
under
such
conditions
and
halfway
down
the
block
how
very
well
i
remember
the
woman
who
touched
my
arm
looked
me
hard
in
the
face
and
said
a
message
for
you
she
got
away
so
quickly
that
i
had
opened
the
blank
envelope
before
she
was
round
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
the
envelope
contained
a
slip
of
white
paper
on
which
was
neatly
printed
in
pen
and
ink
excellent
position
vacant
at
the
pines
pine
cone
theodore
brane
wants
housekeeper
apply
at
this
was
not
signed
at
all
i
thought
some
one
is
thinking
kindly
of
me
after
all
some
oldtime
friend
of
my
father
perhaps
has
sent
a
servant
to
me
with
this
i
returned
to
my
back
and
wrote
at
once
offering
my
services
and
sending
my
references
to
brane
two
days
later
during
which
my
other
efforts
to
find
a
position
entirely
failed
there
came
a
letter
on
good
in
a
light
sloping
hand
the
pines
my
dear
miss
gale
i
shall
be
delighted
to
try
you
as
housekeeper
i
think
you
will
find
the
place
satisfactory
it
is
a
small
household
and
your
duties
will
be
light
though
i
am
very
much
out
of
health
and
must
necessarily
leave
every
detail
of
management
to
you
i
want
you
to
take
your
meals
with
me
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
companionship
the
salary
is
forty
dollars
a
month
sincerely
yours
edna
worthington
brane
and
to
my
delight
she
enclosed
the
first
month
salary
in
advance
i
wonder
if
many
such
checks
are
blistered
with
tears
mine
was
when
i
cashed
it
at
the
bank
at
the
corner
where
my
landlady
suddenly
gracious
made
me
known
three
days
later
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
the
country
more
and
more
flat
and
sandy
with
stunted
pines
and
negro
huts
with
shabby
patches
of
corn
and
potatoes
was
sad
under
a
low
moist
sky
but
my
heart
was
high
with
a
sense
of
adventure
at
all
times
strong
in
me
and
i
read
promise
between
the
lines
of
brane
kind
little
note
i
slept
well
in
my
berth
that
night
and
the
next
afternoon
came
safely
to
pine
cone
my
only
experience
had
been
the
rather
annoying
covert
attention
of
a
man
on
the
train
he
was
a
looking
fellow
and
though
he
tried
to
conceal
his
scrutiny
it
was
disagreeably
incessant
i
was
glad
to
leave
him
on
the
train
and
i
saw
his
face
peering
out
of
the
window
at
me
and
caught
a
curious
expression
when
i
climbed
into
the
cart
that
had
been
sent
to
meet
me
from
the
it
was
a
look
of
intense
excitement
and
it
seemed
to
me
almost
of
alarm
also
his
fingers
drew
a
from
his
pocket
and
he
fell
to
writing
in
it
as
the
train
went
out
i
could
not
help
the
ridiculous
fancy
that
he
was
taking
notes
on
me
i
had
never
been
in
the
south
before
and
the
country
impressed
me
as
being
the
most
desolate
i
had
ever
seen
our
road
took
us
straight
across
the
level
fields
towards
a
low
cloudlike
bank
of
pines
we
passed
through
a
small
town
blighted
by
poverty
and
dark
with
negro
faces
which
had
none
of
the
gayety
i
associated
with
their
race
these
men
and
women
greeted
us
to
be
sure
but
in
rather
a
gloomy
fashion
not
without
grace
and
even
a
certain
stateliness
the
few
whites
looked
poorer
than
the
blacks
or
were
less
able
to
conceal
their
poverty
my
driver
was
a
grizzled
negro
friendly
but
i
soon
found
very
deaf
he
was
eager
to
talk
but
so
often
misinterpreted
my
shouted
questions
that
i
gave
it
up
i
learned
at
least
that
we
had
an
drive
before
us
that
there
was
a
swamp
beyond
the
pine
woods
that
the
climate
was
horribly
unhealthy
in
summer
so
that
most
of
the
gentry
deserted
but
that
brane
always
stayed
though
she
sent
her
little
boy
away
massa
robbie
he
jes
got
back
glad
to
see
him
too
jes
makes
world
of
diffunce
to
hev
a
child
i
too
was
glad
of
the
child
presence
a
merry
little
lad
is
good
company
and
can
easily
be
won
by
a
housekeeper
with
the
pantry
keys
in
her
hand
mrs
brane
is
an
invalid
was
one
of
my
questions
i
remember
to
which
i
had
the
curious
answer
oh
no
missy
not
to
say
timid
not
timorous
it
jes
her
way
don
mean
nothin
she
a
right
peart
little
lady
no
missy
don
get
notions
into
yo
haid
we
ai
none
of
us
timid
no
and
he
gave
his
head
a
valiant
roll
and
clipped
his
fat
gray
horse
with
a
great
show
of
valor
evidently
he
had
mistaken
my
word
invalid
for
timid
but
the
speech
was
queer
and
gave
me
food
for
thought
we
had
come
to
an
end
of
our
talk
by
the
time
we
reached
the
low
ridge
of
pines
and
we
plodded
through
the
heavy
sand
into
the
gloom
out
of
it
and
down
into
the
sudden
dampness
of
the
swamp
in
silence
this
was
strange
country
a
smothered
sort
of
stream
under
high
steep
banks
went
coiling
about
under
twisted
sprawling
trees
all
draped
with
deadlooking
gray
moss
everything
was
gray
sky
road
trees
earth
water
the
air
was
gray
and
heavy
i
tried
not
to
breathe
it
and
was
glad
when
we
came
out
and
up
again
to
our
open
sandy
stretches
there
was
a
further
rise
and
more
trees
a
gate
an
drive
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
stopped
before
a
big
square
white
house
it
had
six
long
columns
from
roof
to
ground
intersected
at
the
second
story
by
a
balcony
floor
the
windows
were
large
the
ceilings
evidently
very
high
in
fact
it
was
the
typical
southern
house
of
which
i
had
seen
pictures
stately
and
not
unbeautiful
though
this
house
looked
in
need
of
care
i
felt
very
nervous
as
i
stepped
across
the
porch
and
pulled
the
bell
my
hands
were
cold
and
my
throat
dry
but
no
sooner
was
the
door
opened
than
i
found
myself
all
but
embraced
by
a
tiny
pale
dark
woman
in
black
who
came
running
out
into
the
high
cold
hall
took
me
by
both
hands
and
spoke
in
the
sweetest
voice
i
had
ever
heard
oh
miss
gale
indeed
i
glad
to
see
you
come
in
now
and
have
tea
with
me
my
little
boy
and
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
all
impatience
since
three
george
must
just
have
humored
the
old
horse
they
both
so
old
that
they
spoil
each
other
out
of
i
she
went
before
me
through
a
double
doorway
trailing
her
scarf
behind
her
and
i
came
into
a
pleasant
room
crowded
with
fussy
little
ornaments
and
large
furniture
it
was
thickly
carpeted
and
darkly
papered
but
was
lit
to
warmth
by
a
bright
open
fire
of
coals
the
glow
was
caught
high
up
by
a
hanging
chandelier
with
long
crystal
pendants
and
under
this
stood
a
little
boy
my
heart
tightened
at
sight
of
him
he
looked
so
small
and
delicate
here
is
our
new
friend
robbie
said
brane
come
and
shake
i
took
the
clammy
little
hand
and
kissed
the
sallow
little
face
the
child
looked
up
such
a
glare
of
speechless
sudden
terror
i
have
never
seen
in
the
eyes
of
any
child
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
it
again
i
stepped
back
half
afraid
and
hurt
for
i
love
children
and
children
love
me
and
this
little
sickly
thing
i
longed
to
take
close
to
my
heart
why
robbie
said
brane
robbie
dear
he
very
timid
miss
gale
you
have
to
excuse
she
had
not
seen
the
look
only
the
shrinking
gesture
he
was
much
worse
than
but
i
was
really
too
overwhelmed
to
speak
i
turned
away
tears
in
my
silly
eyes
and
took
off
my
hat
and
coat
in
silence
tucking
in
a
stray
end
of
hair
the
child
had
got
into
his
mother
lap
and
was
clinging
to
her
while
she
laughed
and
coaxed
him
under
her
encouragements
he
ventured
to
look
up
then
threw
himself
back
stiffened
and
shrieked
pointing
at
me
it
her
hair
it
her
hair
see
her
hair
for
a
few
moments
his
mother
was
fairly
unnerved
then
she
began
to
laugh
again
looked
apologetically
at
me
and
rocking
the
poor
frightened
baby
in
her
arms
oh
miss
gale
she
said
sweetly
not
used
to
such
splendor
in
our
old
house
come
robbie
dear
all
women
are
not
as
little
and
black
and
dreary
as
your
poor
mamma
i
let
him
creep
off
into
a
corner
miss
gale
while
we
have
tea
then
he
get
used
to
your
prettiness
and
that
wonderful
hair
from
a
as
i
came
up
the
child
fled
from
me
and
crouched
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
from
which
his
little
white
face
glimmered
fearfully
brane
poured
tea
and
chattered
incessantly
it
was
evident
that
she
had
suffered
greatly
from
loneliness
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
lived
too
long
in
memories
i
felt
a
warm
desire
to
cheer
and
to
protect
her
she
was
so
small
and
since
my
husband
died
she
said
i
really
have
had
the
courage
to
go
away
it
difficult
to
pull
up
roots
and
then
there
are
the
old
servants
who
depend
so
absolutely
upon
me
if
i
moved
away
it
would
simply
be
to
explode
their
whole
existence
and
i
ca
quite
afford
to
pension
here
she
paused
and
added
absently
at
least
not
i
wondered
if
she
had
expectations
of
wealth
her
phrase
suggested
it
by
the
by
she
went
on
you
must
meet
delia
and
jane
and
annie
they
are
your
business
from
now
on
delia
the
cook
while
annie
and
jane
do
all
the
other
work
i
tell
you
about
them
so
you
be
able
to
understand
their
crotchets
they
really
old
dears
and
as
loyal
as
loyalty
itself
sometimes
she
laughed
a
hollow
little
laugh
that
sounded
as
if
it
had
faded
from
long
disuse
i
wonder
how
on
earth
i
could
get
rid
of
she
gave
me
a
humorous
account
of
the
three
old
women
who
did
the
indoors
work
at
the
she
had
hardly
finished
when
jane
came
in
this
was
the
fat
little
one
wrinkled
with
gray
curls
a
face
little
bright
anxious
eyes
again
i
was
struck
by
the
furtive
frightened
air
every
one
at
the
pines
wore
except
george
the
colored
coachman
with
his
bravado
jane
was
introduced
to
me
and
gave
me
rather
a
gloomy
greeting
nevertheless
i
thought
that
she
too
after
her
own
fashion
was
glad
to
see
me
you
do
keep
colored
servants
for
indoors
do
you
brane
i
asked
when
jane
had
taken
away
the
and
we
were
on
our
way
upstairs
oh
mercy
no
of
all
wretched
superstitious
timid
creatures
negro
women
are
the
most
miserable
i
would
have
one
in
the
house
with
me
over
a
single
night
this
is
your
room
miss
gale
it
is
in
the
old
part
of
the
house
what
we
call
the
northern
wing
opposite
you
along
the
passageway
is
robbie
nursery
which
my
husband
used
in
the
old
days
as
a
sort
of
study
this
end
of
the
house
has
the
deep
windows
you
wo
see
those
window
sills
anywhere
else
at
pines
my
husband
discovered
the
reason
there
a
double
wall
at
this
end
of
the
house
i
think
the
old
northern
wall
was
burnt
or
torn
down
or
out
of
repair
and
a
former
owner
just
clapped
on
another
wall
over
it
or
perhaps
he
thought
it
would
make
this
end
of
the
house
warmer
and
more
weatherproof
it
the
quarter
our
storms
come
from
whatever
the
reason
it
makes
these
end
rooms
very
pretty
i
think
there
nothing
like
a
deep
window
is
there
i
hope
you
will
like
your
i
was
sure
that
i
should
it
was
really
very
fresh
and
pretty
seemed
to
have
been
done
over
recently
for
the
paper
the
matting
the
coat
of
white
paint
on
the
woodwork
the
muslin
curtains
were
all
spick
and
span
after
brane
had
left
me
i
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
i
had
a
charming
view
of
the
old
garden
still
gay
with
late
fall
flowers
and
with
roses
which
bloomed
here
probably
all
winter
long
a
splendid
magnolia
tree
all
but
brushed
the
window
with
its
branches
just
below
stood
a
pretty
arbor
covered
with
and
honeysuckle
i
drew
in
a
deep
breath
of
the
soft
fragrant
air
i
was
very
happy
that
night
very
grateful
for
the
state
of
life
to
which
heaven
had
called
chapter
ii
something
in
the
house
the
little
room
that
opened
from
the
was
given
to
me
by
brane
for
my
here
every
morning
jane
annie
and
delia
came
to
me
for
orders
it
was
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
everything
having
run
smoothly
and
uneventfully
when
earlier
than
usual
there
came
footsteps
and
a
rap
on
the
door
of
this
room
my
come
in
served
to
admit
all
three
old
women
treading
upon
one
another
heels
so
odd
and
so
ridiculous
was
their
appearance
that
i
had
some
ado
to
keep
my
laughter
in
my
throat
why
said
i
what
on
earth
the
matter
jane
little
round
crumpled
face
puckered
and
blinked
stolid
square
person
was
just
a
symbol
of
obstinate
fear
delia
long
lean
and
stooping
with
her
knotted
hand
fingering
her
loose
mouth
shuffled
up
to
me
we
givin
notice
she
whined
astonishment
sent
me
back
into
my
chair
delia
delia
wavered
physically
and
her
eyes
watered
but
the
spirit
of
fear
possessed
her
utterly
i
ca
help
it
i
been
in
this
house
me
last
but
it
impossible
leave
brane
like
this
with
no
notice
no
time
to
get
any
one
else
why
only
the
other
day
she
was
saying
do
see
how
i
could
get
rid
of
them
even
if
i
wanted
to
i
meant
this
to
sting
and
i
succeeded
all
three
queer
old
faces
flushed
delia
muttered
well
she
found
the
way
that
what
has
happened
i
demanded
is
it
because
of
me
no
the
answer
came
promptly
you
the
best
manager
we
had
here
yet
an
you
a
kind
young
this
compliment
came
from
delia
the
most
affable
of
the
three
but
the
fact
is
a
pause
and
the
fright
they
must
have
had
to
bring
them
all
pale
and
gasping
and
inarticulate
like
fish
driven
from
the
dim
world
of
their
accustomed
lives
communicated
itself
in
some
measure
to
me
yes
i
asked
a
little
uncertainly
then
annie
the
stolid
came
out
with
it
there
somethin
in
the
at
the
words
all
three
of
them
drew
together
we
been
suspectin
of
it
for
a
long
time
them
housekeepers
did
leave
a
good
place
an
a

quick

up
the
tale
but
we
kinder
mistrusted
like
that
it
was
foolishness
of
some
kind
but
miss
well
it
i
was
silent
a
moment
looking
at
them
and
feeling
i
confess
rather
blank
what
is
it
then
i
asked
sharply

somethin
jane
wobbled
into
the
talk
or
somebody
contributed
annie
i
rapped
my
desk
something
or
somebody
doing

all
over
the
house

but
especially
in
the
old
part
where
us
servants
live

happened
to
them

the
day
time

so
well
used

the
way

went
by

like
a
draught
of
cold
air

my
hair

right
up
on

draught
of
cold

it
rayther
slow
light
steps

quite
so
dost

me
as

a
sneer

bit
wakeful

of
me
in
the
wall

a
great
i
threw

head
laughing

to
tell

draught
of
cold
air
some
falling
plaster
or
a
rat
in
the
wall
are
going
to
drive
you
away
in
your
old
age
from
a
good
home
out
into
the
world
wait
a
moment
miss
cried
delia
there
somethin
i
waited
this
something
else
seemed
difficult
to
tell
you
go
ahead
breathed
delia
at
last
nudging
annie
who
gulped
and
set
off
with
unusual
rapidity
robbie
was
sick
last
night
towards
he
had
the
night
terrors
mary
said
mary
was
robbie
nurse
of
whom
at
that
time
i
had
seen
little
an
she
could
get
him
quiet
he
kep
about
a
lady
with
red
hair
they
looked
at
me
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
and
i
felt
my
face
grow
hot
a
lady
that
stood
over
him
well
no
tellin
the
fancies
of
a
nervous
child
like
him
anyways
mary
was
after
a
bottle
an
we
bein
wakeful
an
was
after
helpin
her
delia
an
me
we
went
for
a
cup
of
hot
milk
an
me
an
mary
come
upstairs
from
the
kitchen
again
together
an
went
towards
the
nursery
now
miss
again
they
cuddled
up
to
one
another
and
annie
throat
gave
a
queer
sort
of
click
jes
as
we
come
to
the
turn
of
the
passage
we
seen
somethin
come
out
o
the
nursery
quick
quiet
an
jump
away
down
the
hall
an
out
o
sight
delia
an
me
scairt
already
run
away
to
our
own
room
but
mary
she
made
fer
the
nursery
as
quick
as
she
could
an
there
she
found
robbie
all
but
in
fits
so
scairt
he
could
scream
doublin
an
twistin
an
his
eyes
but
when
she
got
him
calmed
down
at
last
why
it
was
the
same
story
a
lady
with
red
hair
that
come
an
stood
over
him
an
stuck
her
face
down
closter
an
closter
jes
a
nightmare
but
we
all
three
seen
the
thing
come
boundin
out
o
his
why
is
mary
here
to
give
notice
i
asked
after
a
few
moments
during
that
time
i
conquered
first
a
certain
feeling
of
fear
caused
less
by
the
story
than
by
the
look
in
delia
light
eyes
and
second
a
very
strong
sensation
of
anger
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
they
enjoyed
that
endless
repetition
of
the
lady
with
red
did
the
silly
creatures
suspect
me
of
playing
ghoulish
tricks
to
terrify
a
child
well
mary
she
looks
rather
peaky
this
mornin
said
annie
but
she
young
an
venturesome
an
she
says
mebbe
we
jes
fancied
the
thing
cornin
out
o
the
nursery
an
anyways
she
the
kind
that
would
leave
her
charge
she
that
fond
of
i
think
i
like
this
mary
said
i
then
looking
them
over
as
scornfully
as
i
could
i
went
on
coldly
very
well
i
take
your
story
to
brane
i
will
tell
her
that
you
want
to
leave
at
once
no
do
waste
any
more
time
do
your
work
and
be
prepared
to
pack
your
trunks
i
think
brane
may
be
glad
to
have
you
but
i
was
really
very
much
surprised
to
find
that
i
was
right
in
this
brane
almost
eagerly
consented
and
even
seemed
to
feel
relief
by
all
means
pack
them
off
as
soon
as
you
can
i
shall
advertise
for
a
man
and
wife
to
take
their
places
it
will
mean
some
pretty
hard
work
for
mary
and
you
for
a
short
time
i
am
afraid
as
i
simply
will
not
have
any
of
these
blacks
in
the
house
but
i
did
in
the
least
mind
hard
work
and
i
told
her
so
and
hastened
to
give
the
result
of
my
interview
first
to
annie
delia
and
jane
who
to
my
satisfaction
seemed
quite
as
much
dashed
as
relieved
at
the
readiness
with
which
their
mistress
let
them
go
and
second
to
mary
the
nurse
chapter
iii
mary
found
mary
with
robbie
in
the
garden
she
got
up
from
her
rustic
chair
under
a
big
magnolia
tree
and
came
hurrying
to
meet
me
more
to
keep
me
from
her
charge
i
thought
than
to
shorten
my
walk
she
need
not
have
distressed
herself
i
felt
keenly
enough
daytime
fear
of
me
but
that
i
should
inspire
horrible
dreams
of
women
bending
over
his
bed
at
night
filled
me
with
a
real
terror
of
the
child
i
would
not
for
anything
have
come
near
to
him
i
stopped
and
waited
for
mary
she
looked
as
fresh
and
sturdy
as
some
hardy
blooming
plant
nothing
peaky
about
her
that
i
could
see
short
and
trim
with
round
loyal
eyes
round
ruddy
face
a
pugnacious
nose
and
a
jaw
not
pretty
certainly
but
as
trusty
and
delightful
to
look
at
as
health
and
honesty
and
cleanliness
could
make
her
i
rejoiced
in
her
that
morning
and
i
have
rejoiced
in
her
ever
since
even
during
that
worst
time
when
her
trust
in
me
wavered
a
little
a
very
little
mary
i
said
can
you
give
me
five
minutes
or
so
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
she
glanced
back
at
robbie
he
was
busy
playing
with
some
sticks
on
the
gravel
path
yes
miss
and
i
had
her
quiet
complete
attention
you
are
frightened
out
of
your
senses
then
this
morning
i
asked
she
did
not
smile
back
at
me
but
she
shook
her
head
no
miss
gale
she
said
sturdily
though
i
did
see
thet
thing
come
out
of
the
nursery
plain
enough
but
it
might
have
been
brane
angora
cat
times
like
that
when
one
is
a
bit
upset
why
things
can
look
twice
as
big
as
they
really
are
and
as
for
robbie
nightmare
why
as
i
make
it
out
it
means
just
nothing
but
that
some
time
when
he
was
a
mere
infant
maybe
some
woman
give
him
a
great
scare
he
a
terrible
nervous
little
fellow
anyways
and
terrible
secret
in
his
ways
at
first
i
could
take
to
him
somehow
he
was
so
queer
but
now
why
and
here
she
did
smile
with
an
honest
radiance
it
would
take
a
ghost
to
scare
me
away
from
takin
care
of
him
and
a
scared
ghost
at
did
you
know
that
delia
and
annie
and
jane
are
all
leaving
us
mary
put
up
her
hands
and
opened
her
blue
eyes
my
lor
the
poor
silly
fools
excuse
me
miss
gale
but
i
never
did
see
such
a
place
for
cowards
them
housekeepers
and
their
nerves
housekeepers
mary
yes
we
had
three
this
summer
they
was
as
lonely
and
jumpy
women
as
ever
i
saw
the
first
she
could
sleep
for
hearin
footsteps
above
her
head
and
the
second
she
felt
somebody
pass
her
in
the
hallway
and
the
third
she
would
say
what
the
matter
was
but
she
was
the
most
frightened
of
all
you
promise
to
be
a
young
lady
with
more
grit
i
glad
of
it
for
i
do
think
a
delicate
lady
like
brane
had
ought
to
have
some
peace
and
quiet
in
her
house
now
miss
i
do
anything
to
help
you
till
you
can
find
some
one
to
take
those
places
i
can
cook
pretty
good
and
i
can
do
the
laundry
too
and
not
neglect
my
robbie
i
dismissed
the
thought
of
the
three
housekeepers
oh
mary
thank
you
you
are
just
splendid
brane
says
she
is
going
to
get
a
man
and
now
that
good
that
what
we
need
a
man
said
mary
she
was
emphatically
an
woman
that
is
a
woman
completely
capable
of
any
sort
of
heroism
but
who
never
feels
safe
unless
there
is
a
man
in
the
house
those
black
men
i
think
are
ghosts
about
a
place
not
that
they
come
in
often
but
one
of
the
housekeepers
was
askin
that
george
be
allowed
to
sleep
inside
i
was
against
it
myself
now
you
depend
upon
me
i
was
almost
absurdly
grateful
partly
because
her
pluck
steadied
my
nerves
which
the
morning
occurrences
had
flurried
a
little
and
partly
because
i
was
glad
that
she
did
not
share
robbie
peculiar
prejudice
i
went
back
to
the
house
thoroughly
braced
and
watched
the
three
old
women
depart
without
a
pang
nevertheless
that
description
of
the
other
housekeepers
did
linger
uncomfortably
in
my
memory
chapter
iv
paul
dabney
be
glad
to
get
at
this
kitchen
said
mary
when
we
went
down
to
survey
the
scene
of
our
impromptu
labors
those
old
women
were
abominably
careless
why
they
left
enough
food
about
and
wasted
enough
to
feed
an
army
i
would
wonder
miss
if
some
of
them
blacks
from
outside
come
in
here
and
make
a
fine
meal
off
of
pickin
they
could
easy
enough
and
brane
never
miss
i
dare
say
said
i
inspecting
the
bright
cheerful
place
with
real
pleasure
but
at
any
rate
delia
was
a
clean
old
soul
everything
as
bright
as
a
new
mary
begrudged
delia
this
compliment
outside
miss
she
said
but
it
a
whited
sepulchre
she
pronounced
it
sepoolcur
look
in
here
a
moment
there
a
closet
that
just
a
she
threw
open
a
low
door
in
the
far
end
of
the
kitchen
and
bending
i
peered
in
why
i
said
it
been
used
as
a
storehouse
for
old
junk
one
end
is
just
a
heap
of
furniture
and
old
machinery
it
would
be
a
job
to
clear
out
too
heavy
as
lead
i
doubt
if
a
woman
could
move
most
of
it
i
think
delia
tried
for
i
see
that
things
have
been
pushed
to
one
side
let
me
have
a
candle
you
go
on
with
your
while
i
get
to
work
in
here
i
might
do
a
little
to
straighten
things
mary
lit
a
candle
and
handed
it
to
me
and
i
went
poking
about
amongst
a
clutter
of
broken
implements
pots
and
kettles
old
garden
tools
even
a
and
came
against
a
great
mass
of
iron
which
turned
out
to
be
a
however
did
it
get
in
here
and
why
was
it
put
here
i
gave
it
a
push
and
found
that
it
rolled
ponderously
but
very
silently
aside
in
the
effort
i
lost
my
balance
a
little
and
put
my
hand
out
to
the
wall
it
went
into
damp
darkness
and
i
fell
there
was
no
wall
at
the
narrow
low
end
of
the
closet
under
the
stairs
but
a
hole
oh
miss
called
mary
coming
to
the
door
her
hands
covered
with
flour
mrs
brane
says
she
wants
you
please
to
take
tea
up
to
the
there
company
i
fancy
and
my
hands
are
in
the
i
came
out
a
little
jarred
by
my
fall
a
little
puzzled
by
that
closet
with
its
dark
open
end
so
carefully
protected
by
a
mass
of
heavy
things
then
for
the
first
time
i
began
really
to
suspect
that
something
was
not
quite
right
at
the
i
said
nothing
to
mary
her
steady
cheerful
sanity
was
invaluable
hastily
i
washed
my
rusty
dusty
hands
smoothed
my
hair
prepared
the
and
went
upstairs
brane
was
entertaining
two
men
in
the
i
came
in
and
set
the
tray
down
on
the
little
table
at
elbow
as
i
did
so
i
glanced
at
the
two
men
one
was
a
large
stout
man
with
gray
hair
and
a
gray
beard
and
a
bullying
manner
belied
by
the
kindly
expression
of
his
eyes
i
liked
him
at
once
the
other
for
some
reason
impressed
me
much
less
favorably
he
had
an
air
of
lazy
indifference
large
demure
eyes
black
hair
very
sleekly
groomed
clothes
which
even
my
ignorance
of
such
matters
proclaimed
themselves
just
what
was
most
appropriate
for
an
afternoon
visit
to
a
southern
country
house
and
a
low
deprecatory
pleasant
voice
he
gave
me
a
casual
look
when
brane
very
pleasantly
introduced
me
she
made
much
more
of
a
guest
of
me
than
of
a
housekeeper
and
dropped
his
eyes
again
on
the
cup
between
his
long
slim
hands
he
dropped
them
however
not
before
i
had
time
to
notice
that
his
pupils
had
grown
suddenly
large
otherwise
his
expression
did
not
change
indeed
why
should
it
but
this
inexplicable
look
in
his
eyes
gave
me
an
unpleasant
little
shock
mr
dabney
brane
was
saying
has
been
sent
over
by
rodman
one
of
our
distant
neighbors
to
enliven
our
dulness
he
wants
to
study
my
husband
russian
library
and
as
my
husband
made
it
an
especial
request
that
his
books
should
not
be
lent
this
means
that
we
shall
see
dabney
very
often
haverstock
has
been
looking
robbie
over
the
poor
little
fellow
nerves
are
in
a
pretty
bad
condition
you
let
me
see
him
wo
you
murmured
young
dabney
i
rather
adore
young
oh
laughed
the
big
doctor
in
his
noisy
way
any
one
who
has
red
hair
may
see
robbie
i
hear
he
has
a
violent
objection
to
red
hair
eh
miss
gale
very
pretty
red
hair
of
course
it
was
friendly
teasing
but
it
angered
me
unreasonably
and
i
felt
the
color
rising
to
my
conspicuous
crop
especially
as
dabney
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
mildly
increasing
interest
how
very
odd
he
said
would
you
mind
taking
dabney
to
the
bookroom
when
he
finished
his
tea
miss
gale
asked
brane
in
her
sweet
way
i
like
to
talk
robbie
over
a
little
longer
with
haverstock
if
you
excuse
me
dabney
show
him
the
card
catalogue
miss
gale
thank
it
was
an
unwelcome
duty
and
i
intended
to
make
it
as
short
as
possible
i
had
not
reckoned
on
young
dabney
ability
as
an
entertainer
he
began
to
talk
as
we
crossed
the
hall
splendid
house
is
it
miss
gale
the
sort
of
place
you
read
about
and
would
like
to
write
about
if
you
had
the
gift
have
you
ever
been
in
the
south
before
no
i
said
discouragingly
this
is
the
i
know
the
country
about
here
very
well
have
you
been
able
to
get
around
much
naturally
not
as
a
housekeeper
for
a
moment
as
we
came
into
the
he
had
stood
looking
gravely
down
now
he
gave
me
a
sudden
frank
merry
look
and
laughed
oh
he
said
it
absurd
too
absurd
you
know
your
being
a
housekeeper
i
mean
you
just
playing
at
it
are
you
indeed
dabney
i
said
i
am
not
i
am
very
little
likely
to
play
at
anything
i
am
earnestly
trying
to
earn
my
living
the
card
catalogue
is
over
there
between
the
front
windows
is
there
anything
else
was
i
rude
he
asked
with
an
absurdly
boyish
air
i
am
sorry
i
did
mean
to
be
but
surely
you
ca
mind
people
noticing
it
i
fell
into
this
little
trap
noticing
what
i
could
forbear
asking
him
why
said
he
the
utter
incongruity
of
your
being
a
housekeeper
at
all
i
believe
that
that
is
what
frightened
there
was
a
strange
note
in
his
voice
now
an
edge
was
he
trying
to
be
disagreeable
i
could
not
make
out
this
young
man
i
moved
away
miss
gale
he
was
perfectly
distant
and
casual
again
i
have
to
detain
you
just
a
moment
this
bookcase
is
locked
you
see
i
ask
i
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
key
dabney
was
busy
with
the
card
catalogue
but
for
some
reason
i
have
always
had
a
catlike
sense
in
such
matters
i
felt
that
he
had
only
just
returned
to
this
position
and
that
he
wanted
me
to
believe
that
he
had
spent
the
entire
time
of
my
absence
there
these
other
housekeepers
he
said
were
very
earnest
about
earning
their
living
were
they
brane
was
telling
me
oh
i
smiled
rather
surprised
that
brane
had
been
so
confidential
to
me
she
had
never
mentioned
the
other
housekeepers
they
were
very
nervous
women
you
see
i
am
he
turned
the
key
about
in
his
hand
looked
down
then
up
at
me
demurely
he
had
the
most
disarming
and
look
no
he
said
you
are
not
nervous
it
a
great
thing
to
have
a
steady
nerve
you
not
easily
then
turning
to
the
bookcase
he
added
sharply
looking
back
at
me
as
he
spoke
do
you
know
anything
about
russia
no
i
answered
that
is
very
there
were
reasons
why
this
subject
was
distasteful
to
me
again
i
moved
away
he
opened
the
bookcase
phew
he
said
the
dust
of
ages
here
i
have
to
ask
brane
to
let
you
i
went
out
and
shut
the
door
but
i
was
not
so
easily
to
escape
young
dabney
determination
to
see
more
of
me
brane
that
very
evening
asked
me
to
spend
my
mornings
dusting
her
husband
books
and
cataloguing
them
at
first
i
dreaded
these
hours
with
our
visitor
but
as
the
days
went
by
i
came
more
and
more
to
enjoy
them
i
found
myself
talking
to
dabney
freely
more
about
my
thoughts
and
fancies
than
about
my
life
which
holds
too
much
that
is
painful
and
he
was
at
first
a
most
frank
and
engaging
companion
i
was
young
and
lonely
i
had
never
had
such
pleasant
intercourse
well
there
is
no
use
apologizing
for
it
trying
to
explain
it
beating
about
the
bush
i
lost
my
heart
to
him
it
went
out
irrevocably
before
the
shadow
fell
and
i
thought
that
his
heart
had
begun
to
move
towards
mine
sometimes
there
was
the
strangest
look
of
troubled
feeling
in
his
eyes
this
preoccupation
kept
me
from
thinking
of
other
things
i
was
always
going
over
yesterday
conversation
with
dabney
planning
enjoying
brane
seemed
to
watch
us
with
sympathy
after
a
week
or
so
she
put
an
end
to
what
she
called
paul
dabney
short
comings
and
long
goings
and
invited
him
to
stay
with
us
he
accepted
and
i
was
wonderfully
happy
i
felt
very
young
for
the
first
time
in
my
whole
sad
life
i
remember
this
period
as
a
sort
of
shadowy
green
stretch
in
a
long
horrible
rocky
journey
it
came
the
quiet
shady
stretch
soon
enough
to
an
end
chapter
v
not
in
the
daytime
labors
and
mine
did
not
last
very
long
at
the
end
of
a
week
a
promising
couple
applied
for
the
position
described
in
advertisement
they
drove
up
to
the
house
in
a
hired
hack
one
morning
and
brane
and
i
interviewed
them
in
my
little
office
they
were
english
people
and
had
one
or
two
references
these
were
rather
antiquated
to
be
sure
dating
to
a
time
before
the
marriage
but
they
explained
that
for
a
long
while
they
had
been
living
on
their
savings
but
that
now
the
higher
cost
of
living
had
forced
them
to
go
into
service
again
the
woman
would
have
been
very
handsome
except
for
a
defect
in
her
proportions
her
face
was
very
much
too
large
also
there
was
a
lack
of
expression
in
the
large
eyes
the
man
was
the
most
discreet
type
of
english
house
servant
imaginable
with
side
whiskers
and
a
small
slightly
mouth
his
eyes
were
so
small
that
they
were
almost
negligible
in
the
long
narrow
head
their
general
appearance
however
was
presentable
and
their
manner
left
nothing
to
be
desired
to
me
especially
they
were
so
respectful
so
docile
so
eager
to
serve
that
i
found
it
almost
disconcerting
they
had
the
oddest
way
of
fixing
their
eyes
on
me
as
though
waiting
for
some
sort
of
signal
sometimes
i
fancied
that
far
down
underneath
the
servility
of
those
two
pairs
of
eyes
there
was
a
furtive
expression
of
something
i
could
not
quite
translate
fear
perhaps
or
how
can
i
express
it
a
sort
of
fearful
awareness
of
secret
understanding
perhaps
there
is
no
better
way
to
describe
it
than
to
say
that
i
should
not
have
been
astonished
if
looking
up
quickly
into
the
woman
large
blank
handsome
face
i
should
have
surprised
a
wink
and
she
would
have
expected
me
to
understand
the
wink
of
course
i
did
not
gather
all
these
impressions
at
once
it
was
only
as
the
days
went
by
that
i
accumulated
them
once
and
once
only
henry
lorrence
the
new
man
was
guilty
of
a
real
impertinence
i
had
been
busy
in
the
bookroom
with
my
interminable
but
delightful
task
of
dusting
and
arranging
brane
books
in
paul
dabney
company
and
hearing
mary
voice
calling
from
the
garden
rather
anxiously
for
miss
gale
i
came
out
suddenly
into
the
hall
henry
was
standing
there
near
the
door
of
the
bookroom
doing
nothing
that
i
could
see
though
he
certainly
had
a
in
his
hand
he
looked
not
at
all
abashed
by
my
discovery
of
him
on
the
contrary
that
indescribable
look
of
mutual
understanding
or
of
an
expectation
of
mutual
understanding
took
strong
possession
of
his
face
i
see
you
keepin
your
eyes
on
him
madam
said
he
softly
jerking
his
head
towards
the
room
where
i
had
left
dabney
i
was
vexed
of
course
and
i
suppose
my
face
showed
it
my
reproof
was
not
so
severe
however
as
to
cause
such
a
look
of
cowering
fear
henry
turned
pale
his
thin
loose
lips
seemed
to
find
themselves
unable
to
fit
together
properly
he
stammered
out
an
abject
apology
and
melted
away
in
the
hall
i
stood
for
several
minutes
staring
after
him
i
remember
and
when
turning
i
found
that
dabney
had
followed
me
to
the
door
and
was
watching
both
me
and
the
departing
man
i
was
distinctly
and
unreasonably
annoyed
with
him
he
too
melted
away
into
the
room
and
i
went
out
to
see
mary
in
the
garden
truly
i
never
thought
myself
a
particularly
person
but
since
i
had
come
to
the
pines
every
one
from
robbie
to
this
young
man
every
one
that
is
except
mary
and
brane
seemed
to
regard
me
with
varying
degrees
of
fear
it
distressed
me
but
at
the
same
time
gave
me
a
new
feeling
of
power
and
i
believe
it
was
a
support
to
me
in
the
difficult
and
terrifying
days
to
come
at
the
box
hedge
of
the
garden
mary
met
me
as
usual
she
kept
me
at
a
distance
from
her
charge
miss
gale
she
said
may
i
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
for
as
many
minutes
as
you
like
i
said
cordially
she
moved
to
a
little
arbor
near
by
where
there
was
a
rustic
seat
i
sat
down
upon
it
and
she
stood
before
me
her
strong
red
hands
folded
on
her
apron
i
saw
that
she
was
grave
and
anxious
though
as
steady
as
ever
miss
gale
is
a
queer
matter
she
began
my
heart
gave
a
sad
jump
oh
mary
i
begged
her
do
say
anything
please
about
ghosts
or
weird
presences
in
the
she
tried
to
smile
but
it
was
a
attempt
miss
gale
she
said
you
know
i
are
the
one
to
make
mountains
out
of
and
you
know
i
ai
easy
scairt
but
miss
for
sake
somethin
must
be
what
must
be
done
mary
well
miss
i
do
say
as
it
may
be
nerves
nerves
is
mysterious
things
as
well
i
know
havin
lived
in
a
haunted
house
in
the
old
country
where
chains
was
dragged
up
and
down
the
front
stairs
regular
after
dark
and
doin
which
all
of
us
took
as
a
matter
of
course
but
which
was
explained
to
the
help
when
they
was
engaged
but
i
do
think
that
brane
had
ought
to
move
robbie
out
of
that
wing
yes
that
i
has
anything
more
happened
i
asked
blankly
yes
that
is
to
say
robbie
nightmares
has
been
gettin
worse
than
ever
and
last
night
when
i
run
into
the
nursery
jumpin
out
of
my
bed
as
quick
as
i
could
and
not
even
stoppin
for
my
slippers
you
know
miss
i
sleep
right
next
to
the
nursery
and
keeps
a
night
light
burnin
for
i
not
one
of
the
people
that
holds
to
discipline
and
lets
a
nervous
child
cry
hisself
into
fits
when
i
come
in
i
seen
the
nursery
door
close
and
just
a
bit
of
a
gown
of
some
sort
whiskin
round
the
edge
robbie
was
most
beside
hisself
i
did
hardly
dare
to
leave
him
but
i
run
to
the
door
and
i
flung
it
wide
open
sudden
the
way
a
body
does
when
they
but
means
to
do
the
right
thing
and
in
course
the
hall
was
dark
but
miss
mary
swallowed
i
heard
a
footstep
far
down
the
passage
in
the
direction
of
your
my
blood
chilled
all
along
my
veins
in
the
direction
of
my
room
yes
miss
so
much
so
that
i
thought
it
been
you
and
i
felt
a
bit
easier
like
but
when
i
come
back
to
robbie
here
she
turned
her
troubled
eyes
from
my
face
why
he
was
yellin
and
screamin
again
about
that
woman
with
red
hair
oh
miss
gale
do
you
be
angry
with
me
you
know
i
your
friend
but
miss
did
you
ever
walk
in
your
sleep
no
mary
no
i
said
and
to
my
surprise
i
had
no
more
of
a
voice
than
a
whisper
to
say
it
in
after
a
pause
you
must
lock
me
in
at
night
after
this
mary
i
added
more
firmly
or
better
still
after
robbie
is
sound
asleep
let
me
come
into
your
bedroom
you
can
make
me
up
some
sort
of
a
bed
there
and
we
will
keep
watch
over
robbie
i
am
sure
it
is
just
a
dream
of
his
the
woman
with
red
hair
bending
over
him
and
i
am
sure
too
that
the
closing
door
and
the
gown
and
the
footstep
were
the
result
of
a
nervous
and
excited
imagination
you
had
been
waked
suddenly
out
of
a
sound
i
was
broad
awake
said
mary
in
the
voice
of
one
who
would
like
to
be
convinced
i
sat
there
cold
in
the
warm
sun
thinking
of
that
woman
with
long
red
hair
who
visited
robbie
that
it
might
be
myself
prompted
by
some
ghoulish
influence
of
sleep
and
night
made
my
very
heart
sick
mary
i
asked
pitifully
enough
did
robbie
ever
see
the
woman
with
red
hair
before
i
came
to
pines
unwillingly
she
shook
her
head
no
miss
the
first
time
he
woke
up
screamin
about
her
was
the
night
before
delia
and
jane
and
annie
gave
but
he
was
afraid
of
women
before
mary
because
as
soon
as
i
took
off
my
hat
downstairs
in
the
the
afternoon
i
arrived
he
pointed
at
me
and
cried
her
hair
is
that
so
miss
said
mary
much
impressed
well
that
does
point
to
his
havin
been
scairt
by
some
person
before
you
come
surely
robbie
could
tell
you
something
that
would
explain
the
whole
thing
i
said
irritably
have
you
questioned
him
mary
flung
up
her
hands
have
i
as
long
as
i
dared
miss
gale
it
as
much
as
his
life
is
worth
haverstock
has
forbidden
it
that
strange
i
think
for
i
know
that
the
first
way
to
be
rid
of
some
nervous
terror
is
to
confess
its
yes
mary
was
evidently
impressed
by
my
knowledge
and
just
what
haverstock
said
hisself
but
he
says
it
has
got
to
be
drawn
out
of
robbie
by
what
he
calls
the
indirect
method
he
has
asked
dabney
to
win
the
child
confidence
that
is
it
was
own
suggestion
i
believe
dabney
was
with
brane
and
the
doctor
when
they
was
discussing
robbie
and
he
says
he
likes
children
and
they
likes
him
as
indeed
they
do
miss
robbie
and
him
are
like
two
kiddies
together
at
railroads
and
such
in
the
gravel
yesterday
did
he
ask
robbie
about
the
woman
yesterday
because
that
may
have
brought
on
the
nightmare
last
night
i
do
know
miss
i
was
in
earshot
of
them
dabney
he
always
coaxes
robbie
a
bit
away
from
the
bench
where
i
set
and
sew
out
i
think
i
ask
dabney
i
said
i
began
to
move
away
then
with
an
afterthought
i
turned
back
to
mary
she
was
studying
me
with
a
dubious
air
i
think
we
had
better
try
the
plan
of
watching
closely
over
robbie
before
we
say
anything
to
alarm
brane
i
said
it
would
distress
her
very
much
to
move
robbie
out
of
his
nursery
and
she
has
been
very
tired
and
languid
lately
she
has
been
doing
too
much
i
think
this
new
woman
sara
lorrence
is
a
terror
for
and
urged
brane
to
let
her
give
the
old
part
of
the
house
a
thorough
cleaning
brane
simply
wo
keep
away
she
works
almost
as
hard
as
sara
and
goes
into
every
crack
and
cranny
and
digs
out
old
rubbish
nothing
more
yes
mary
agreed
she
sure
a
wonder
at
cleaning
that
sara
she
straightened
out
our
kitchen
closet
somethin
wonderful
she
has
i
wondered
if
sara
too
had
discovered
that
queer
opening
in
the
back
of
the
closet
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
but
now
i
decided
absurd
as
such
action
probably
was
to
investigate
the
black
hole
into
which
i
had
fallen
when
i
tried
to
move
the
lawn
roller
i
chose
a
time
when
sara
lorrence
was
out
of
the
kitchen
cutting
lettuces
in
the
for
several
minutes
i
watched
her
broad
body
at
its
task
then
singing
softly
to
myself
for
some
reason
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
was
in
danger
i
walked
across
the
clean
board
floor
and
stepped
into
the
closet
to
which
my
attention
had
first
been
drawn
by
mary
it
was
indeed
a
renovated
spot
sweet
and
garnished
like
the
abode
of
devils
in
the
parable
pots
scoured
and
arranged
on
shelves
rubbish
cleared
out
the
removed
the
roller
taken
to
some
more
appropriate
place
but
it
was
in
its
further
recesses
as
dark
as
ever
i
moved
in
bending
down
my
head
and
feeling
before
me
with
my
hand
my
fingers
came
presently
against
a
wall
i
felt
about
in
front
on
either
side
up
and
down
there
was
no
break
anywhere
either
i
had
imagined
an
opening
or
my
hole
had
been
boarded
up
i
went
out
lighted
a
candle
and
returned
the
closet
was
entirely
normal
just
a
kitchen
closet
with
a
sloping
roof
it
lay
under
the
back
stairs
one
small
narrow
wall
and
three
high
wide
ones
the
low
narrow
wall
stood
where
i
had
imagined
my
hole
i
went
close
and
examined
it
by
the
light
of
my
candle
there
was
only
one
peculiarity
about
this
wall
it
had
a
temporary
look
and
was
made
of
odd
old
boards
which
it
seemed
to
me
showed
signs
of
recent
workmanship
perhaps
henry
had
made
repairs
i
blew
out
my
candle
and
stepped
from
the
closet
sara
had
come
back
from
the
garden
she
greeted
my
appearance
with
a
low
quavering
cry
of
fear
oh
my
god
then
recovering
herself
though
her
large
face
remained
ashen
excuse
me
she
said
timidly
i
was
expectin
to
see
you
there
and
she
added
incomprehensibly
in
the
now
for
some
reason
these
words
gave
me
the
most
horrible
chill
of
fear
my
mind
simply
turned
away
from
them
i
could
not
question
sara
of
their
meaning
subconsciously
i
must
have
refused
to
understand
them
it
is
always
difficult
to
describe
such
psychological
phenomena
but
this
is
one
that
i
am
sure
many
people
have
experienced
it
is
akin
to
the
paralysis
which
attacks
one
in
frightening
dreams
and
sometimes
in
real
life
and
prevents
escape
the
sort
of
shock
it
gave
me
absolutely
forbade
my
taking
any
notice
of
it
i
spoke
to
sara
in
a
strained
hard
voice
you
have
been
putting
the
closet
in
order
i
said
has
henry
been
repairing
it
i
mean
has
he
been
mending
up
that
hole
yes
she
said
half
sullenly
accordin
to
your
and
she
glanced
around
as
though
she
were
afraid
some
one
might
be
listening
to
us
my
orders
i
gave
no
orders
whatever
about
this
closet
my
voice
was
almost
shrill
and
sounded
angry
though
i
was
not
angry
only
terribly
and
quite
unreasonably
frightened
just
as
you
please
said
sara
with
that
curious
submissiveness
and
its
undercurrent
of
something
else
just
as
you
say
of
course
you
did
give
no
such
orders
not
you
i
just
had
henry
nail
it
up
myself
here
she
fixed
those
expressionless
eyes
upon
me
and
the
lid
of
one
or
i
imagined
it
just
drooped
on
account
of
sleuths
i
echoed
a
kitchen
name
for
rats
said
sara
and
came
as
near
to
laughing
as
i
ever
saw
her
come
rats
that
comes
about
old
houses
such
as
and
here
she
glanced
in
a
meaning
way
over
her
shoulder
out
of
the
window
my
glance
followed
hers
in
fact
my
whole
body
followed
i
went
and
stood
near
the
window
the
kitchen
was
on
a
lower
level
than
the
garden
so
that
i
looked
up
to
the
gravel
path
here
dabney
was
walking
with
robbie
hand
in
his
robbie
was
chattering
like
a
bird
and
paul
dabney
was
smiling
down
at
him
it
was
a
pretty
picture
in
the
pale
november
sunshine
a
prettier
picture
than
sara
face
but
as
i
looked
at
them
gratefully
feeling
that
the
very
sight
of
those
two
was
bringing
me
back
from
a
queer
attack
of
dementia
robbie
looking
by
chance
my
way
threw
himself
against
his
companion
stiffening
and
pointing
i
heard
his
shrill
cry
there
she
is
i
they
take
her
away
i
flinched
out
of
his
sight
covering
my
face
with
my
hands
and
hurrying
towards
the
inner
door
which
led
to
the
kitchen
stairs
i
did
not
want
to
look
again
at
sara
but
something
forced
me
to
do
so
she
was
watching
me
with
a
look
of
fearful
amusement
a
most
disgusting
look
i
rushed
through
the
door
and
stumbled
up
the
stairs
i
was
shaking
with
anger
and
fear
and
pain
of
heart
and
yet
this
last
feeling
was
the
only
one
whose
cause
i
could
fully
explain
to
myself
paul
dabney
had
seen
a
child
turn
pale
and
stiff
with
fear
at
the
mere
sight
of
me
and
i
could
not
forget
the
grim
stern
look
with
which
he
followed
little
pitiful
pointing
finger
and
i
had
fancied
that
this
man
was
falling
in
love
with
me
truly
my
nerves
should
have
been
in
no
condition
to
face
the
dreadful
ordeal
of
the
time
that
was
to
come
but
truly
too
and
very
mercifully
those
nerves
are
made
of
steel
they
bend
often
and
with
agonizing
pain
but
they
do
not
break
i
know
now
that
they
never
will
they
have
been
tested
supremely
and
have
stood
the
test
chapter
vi
a
strand
of
hair
went
to
bed
early
that
night
and
partially
undressing
myself
i
put
on
a
wrapper
and
sat
on
my
bed
reading
till
mary
should
come
to
tell
me
that
robbie
had
fallen
asleep
and
that
it
was
time
for
our
to
begin
i
had
not
spoken
to
mary
again
on
the
subject
for
soon
after
my
investigations
in
the
kitchen
brane
had
asked
me
to
help
her
in
her
work
of
going
over
the
old
drawers
and
wardrobes
in
the
north
wing
and
i
had
had
a
very
busy
and
tiring
afternoon
it
was
a
relief
however
to
find
that
sara
dropped
her
labors
when
i
appeared
brane
looked
almost
as
relieved
as
i
felt
that
is
the
most
indefatigable
worker
i
ever
met
miss
gale
she
said
in
her
listless
nervous
way
she
been
glued
to
my
side
ever
since
we
began
this
interminable
piece
of
i
wish
you
give
it
up
dear
brane
i
said
and
let
the
indefatigable
sara
tire
out
her
own
energy
i
sure
that
you
have
none
to
spare
and
this
going
over
of
old
letters
and
papers
and
books
and
clothes
is
very
tiring
and
depressing
work
for
she
gave
a
tormented
sigh
oh
is
it
it
aging
she
stood
before
a
great
old
highboy
its
drawers
pulled
out
and
she
looked
so
tiny
and
helpless
as
small
almost
as
robbie
all
the
rest
of
the
furniture
was
as
massive
as
the
highboy
the
and
the
bureau
and
the
tall
mirror
with
its
tarnished
frame
i
liked
the
mirror
and
rather
admired
its
reflection
of
myself
brane
looked
wistfully
about
the
room
and
her
eyes
like
mine
stopped
at
the
mirror
how
young
you
look
beside
me
she
said
and
so
bright
with
that
wonderful
hair
i
wish
you
let
me
know
you
better
dear
i
am
really
very
fond
of
you
you
know
and
you
must
have
something
of
a
history
with
your
beauty
and
your
air
and
that
halo
of
tragedy
dabney
talks
she
smiled
teasingly
but
i
was
too
sad
to
smile
back
my
history
is
not
romantic
i
said
bitterly
it
is
dull
and
sordid
you
are
very
good
to
me
dear
i
was
close
to
tears
i
wish
i
could
do
more
for
more
why
child
if
it
was
for
you
i
run
away
from
and
never
come
back
inducement
no
consideration
of
any
kind
would
keep
me
in
this
she
certainly
spoke
as
though
she
had
in
mind
some
very
weighty
inducement
and
consideration
why
do
you
stay
i
asked
impulsively
at
least
why
you
go
away
for
a
change
it
would
do
you
so
much
good
and
it
would
be
wonderful
for
robbie
why
brane
you
have
left
this
place
for
a
day
have
you
since
your
husband
died
no
dear
said
the
little
lady
sorrowfully
hardly
for
an
hour
my
she
looked
about
the
room
again
and
added
as
though
she
were
talking
to
herself
i
do
dare
to
leave
dare
i
repeated
she
smiled
deprecatingly
that
was
a
silly
word
to
use
was
it
again
that
tormented
little
sigh
you
see
i
a
silly
little
person
i
not
fit
to
carry
the
weight
of
other
people
again
i
repeated
like
some
brainless
parrot
secrets
of
course
there
are
secrets
child
she
said
impatiently
every
one
has
secrets
their
own
or
other
people
you
have
secrets
without
doubt
i
had
she
had
successfully
silenced
me
after
that
we
worked
steadily
and
there
was
no
further
attempt
at
confidence
nevertheless
as
i
lay
on
my
bed
trying
to
read
and
waiting
for
summons
i
decided
that
i
would
make
a
strong
effort
to
get
brane
and
robbie
out
of
the
house
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
my
employer
was
the
victim
of
a
mild
sort
of
mania
one
symptom
of
which
was
a
fear
of
leaving
her
home
i
thought
i
would
consult
with
haverstock
and
get
him
to
order
robbie
and
robbie
mother
a
change
of
air
it
might
cure
the
little
fellow
of
his
nervous
terrors
how
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
this
plan
a
few
days
sooner
what
dreadful
reason
i
have
for
regretting
my
delay
mary
was
a
long
time
in
coming
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
a
while
later
i
became
aware
that
i
had
slipped
down
on
my
pillows
and
that
my
book
had
fallen
to
the
floor
i
got
up
feeling
rather
startled
and
looked
at
my
clock
it
was
already
twelve
and
mary
had
not
called
me
i
went
to
my
door
and
found
that
it
was
locked
i
remembered
that
it
had
been
my
alternate
plan
for
mary
to
lock
me
in
and
i
supposed
that
she
had
forgotten
that
our
final
decision
was
in
favor
of
the
other
scheme
or
she
had
preferred
to
watch
over
robbie
alone
i
was
a
little
hurt
but
i
acquiesced
in
my
imprisonment
and
went
back
to
bed
i
put
out
the
light
and
was
very
soon
asleep
again
i
was
waked
by
a
dreadful
sound
of
screaming
i
sat
up
in
bed
stiff
with
fear
my
heart
leaping
then
i
ran
towards
the
door
remembered
that
it
was
locked
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
pressing
my
hands
together
the
screaming
stopped
robbie
had
had
his
nightmare
and
it
was
over
thank
god
this
time
my
alibi
was
established
without
doubt
i
was
enormously
relieved
for
i
had
begun
myself
to
fear
that
i
had
been
walking
in
my
sleep
and
perhaps
influenced
by
the
description
of
robbie
favorite
nightmare
had
unconsciously
acted
out
the
horror
beside
his
bed
after
a
while
the
house
being
fairly
quiet
though
i
thought
i
would
hear
mary
moving
about
i
went
back
to
my
bed
when
she
could
leave
her
charge
i
knew
that
she
would
come
to
me
with
her
story
i
tried
to
be
calm
and
patient
but
of
course
i
was
anything
but
that
it
was
nearly
morning
a
faint
greenish
light
spread
in
the
sky
opening
fanlike
fingers
through
the
slats
of
my
shutter
after
a
while
it
seemed
interminable
a
step
came
down
the
hall
it
was
not
padded
nurselike
tread
it
was
the
quick
resolute
footstep
of
a
man
it
stopped
outside
my
door
there
was
no
ceremony
of
knocking
no
key
turned
the
handle
was
sharply
moved
and
to
my
utter
amazement
the
door
opened
there
stood
paul
dabney
fully
dressed
his
face
pale
and
grim
come
out
he
said
come
with
me
and
see
what
has
been
i
noticed
that
he
kept
one
hand
in
his
pocket
and
that
the
pocket
bulged
i
got
up
still
in
my
wrapper
my
hair
hanging
in
two
long
dishevelled
braids
and
came
in
a
dazed
way
towards
him
he
took
me
by
the
wrist
using
his
left
hand
the
other
still
in
his
pocket
his
fingers
were
as
cold
and
hard
as
steel
i
shrunk
a
little
from
them
and
he
gave
my
wrist
a
queer
cruel
little
shake
what
does
it
feel
like
eh
he
snarled
i
merely
looked
at
him
his
unexpected
appearance
his
terrible
manner
the
opening
of
that
locked
door
without
the
use
of
any
key
above
all
a
dull
sense
of
some
overwhelming
tragedy
for
which
i
was
to
be
held
responsible
all
these
things
held
me
dumb
and
powerless
i
let
him
keep
his
grasp
on
my
wrist
and
i
walked
beside
him
along
the
as
though
i
were
indeed
a
somnambulist
so
we
came
to
the
nursery
door
inside
i
saw
mary
kneeling
beside
robbie
little
bed
and
heard
her
sobbing
as
though
her
heart
would
break
what
is
it
i
whispered
looking
at
paul
dabney
and
pulling
back
my
look
must
have
made
some
impression
on
him
a
queer
sort
of
gleam
of
doubt
seemed
to
pass
across
his
face
he
drew
me
towards
the
cot
keeping
his
eyes
riveted
upon
me
there
lay
the
little
boy
who
had
never
allowed
me
to
come
so
near
to
him
before
passive
and
still
a
white
little
face
a
body
like
a
broken
flower
i
saw
at
once
that
he
was
dead
oh
miss
sobbed
mary
keeping
her
face
hidden
why
did
you
keep
to
your
plan
oh
god
have
mercy
on
us
we
have
killed
the
poor
soul
mary
i
whispered
you
locked
me
oh
indeed
miss
gale
no
i
thought
you
said
you
come
and
spend
the
night
with
me
i
had
a
couch
made
up
i
waited
for
you
and
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
here
she
got
to
her
feet
drying
her
eyes
we
were
both
talking
in
whispers
dabney
still
held
my
wrist
the
little
corpse
lay
silent
there
before
us
as
though
he
were
asleep
i
was
waked
by
robbie
oh
my
lamb
my
lamb
again
she
wept
and
tears
poured
down
my
own
face
i
heard
him
i
choked
i
would
have
come
but
the
door
was
here
dabney
fingers
tightened
perceptibly
almost
painfully
upon
my
wrist
i
opened
your
locked
door
he
sneered
remember
mary
looked
at
me
with
bewildered
eyes
i
did
lock
your
door
we
stared
at
each
other
in
dumb
and
tragic
mystification
i
came
to
robbie
as
fast
as
i
could
she
went
on
i
was
too
late
to
see
any
one
go
out
he
was
in
convulsions
the
pitiful
baby
in
my
arms
he
died
before
ever
i
could
call
for
help
dabney
come
in
almost
at
once
and
and
oh
miss
who
to
tell
his
mother
i
made
a
move
i
must
i
began
but
that
cold
steel
grip
on
my
wrist
coerced
me
you
go
mary
said
dabney
and
break
it
to
her
carefully
send
for
haverstock
this
will
stay
here
with
me
he
added
between
his
teeth
mary
with
a
little
moan
obeyed
and
went
out
and
slowly
away
paul
dabney
and
i
stood
in
silence
linked
together
strangely
in
that
room
of
death
this
was
the
man
i
loved
i
looked
at
him
you
look
as
innocent
as
a
flower
he
said
painfully
perhaps
this
will
move
he
drew
me
close
to
robbie
he
lifted
one
of
the
little
hands
and
laid
it
still
warm
in
mine
the
small
fingers
were
clenched
into
a
fist
and
about
two
of
them
was
wrapped
a
strand
of
hair
i
fell
down
at
paul
dabney
feet
the
consciousness
of
his
grip
on
my
wrist
which
kept
me
from
measuring
my
length
on
the
floor
stayed
with
me
through
a
strange
short
journey
into
forgetfulness
ah
said
paul
dabney
as
i
came
back
and
raised
my
head
i
thought
that
would
cut
the
ground
from
under
he
quietly
untwisted
the
hairs
from
the
child
clutch
and
still
keeping
his
hold
of
me
he
put
the
lock
into
his
and
replaced
it
in
an
inner
pocket
stand
up
he
said
i
obeyed
the
blood
was
beginning
to
return
to
my
brain
and
with
it
an
intolerable
sense
of
outrage
i
returned
him
look
for
look
if
i
am
unfortunate
enough
to
walk
in
my
sleep
i
said
quiveringly
and
if
through
this
misfortune
i
have
been
so
terribly
unhappy
as
to
cause
the
death
of
this
poor
delicate
child
is
that
any
reason
paul
dabney
that
you
should
hold
me
by
the
wrist
and
threaten
me
and
treat
me
like
a
murderess
i
was
standing
at
my
full
height
and
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
to
my
inexpressible
relief
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
his
eyes
faltered
from
their
implacable
judgment
his
lips
relaxed
his
fingers
slowly
slipped
from
my
wrist
i
caught
his
arm
in
both
my
hands
paul
paul
i
gasped
not
for
long
afterwards
did
i
realize
that
i
had
used
his
name
how
can
you
how
can
you
put
me
through
such
agony
as
though
this
were
not
enough
o
god
god
i
broke
down
utterly
i
shook
and
wept
he
held
me
in
his
arms
i
could
feel
him
tremble
go
back
to
your
room
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
guilty
sort
of
voice
try
to
command
i
faltered
away
trying
pitifully
as
a
punished
child
to
be
obedient
to
be
good
to
merit
trust
he
looked
after
me
with
such
a
face
of
doubt
and
despair
that
had
it
not
been
for
robbie
small
countenance
i
must
have
been
haunted
by
the
look
i
got
somehow
to
my
room
and
lay
down
on
my
bed
i
was
broken
in
body
mind
and
spirit
for
the
time
being
there
was
no
strength
or
courage
left
in
me
but
they
came
back
chapter
vii
the
russian
was
fortunate
for
us
all
especially
for
poor
mary
that
after
robbie
death
brane
needed
every
care
and
attention
that
we
could
give
her
for
myself
i
had
expected
prompt
dismissal
but
as
it
turned
out
brane
more
than
ever
insisted
upon
my
staying
on
as
housekeeper
neither
mary
because
of
her
loyalty
to
me
nor
paul
dabney
for
some
less
friendly
reason
had
told
the
poor
little
woman
of
the
cause
of
robbie
death
nor
of
their
suspicions
concerning
my
complicity
unconscious
or
otherwise
it
may
seem
strange
to
the
reader
that
i
should
not
have
left
the
it
seems
strange
to
me
now
but
there
was
more
than
one
reason
for
my
courage
or
my
obstinacy
first
i
felt
that
after
extraordinary
treatment
of
me
treatment
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
explain
and
for
which
he
made
no
apology
my
honor
demanded
that
i
should
stay
in
the
house
and
clear
up
the
double
mystery
of
the
locked
door
that
opened
and
of
the
strand
of
hair
that
was
wrapped
around
poor
little
robbie
fingers
of
course
i
may
have
dreamed
that
the
door
was
locked
i
may
have
that
time
when
i
fancied
myself
broad
awake
been
really
in
a
state
of
trance
and
instead
of
finding
a
locked
door
and
going
back
to
bed
i
may
then
have
gone
through
the
door
and
down
the
hall
to
robbie
nursery
coming
to
myself
only
when
being
again
in
bed
i
had
awakened
to
the
sound
of
his
screams
this
explanation
i
know
was
the
one
adopted
by
mary
dabney
had
other
and
darker
suspicions
i
realized
that
in
some
mysterious
fashion
he
had
constituted
himself
my
judge
i
realized
too
by
degrees
and
here
if
you
like
was
the
chief
reason
for
my
not
leaving
the
pines
that
paul
dabney
simply
would
not
have
let
me
go
unobtrusively
quietly
more
almost
loathfully
he
kept
me
under
a
strict
surveillance
i
became
conscious
of
it
slowly
if
i
had
to
leave
the
place
on
an
errand
he
accompanied
me
or
he
sent
mary
to
accompany
me
at
about
this
time
brane
without
asking
any
advice
from
me
engaged
two
outdoor
men
they
were
to
tidy
up
the
grounds
she
told
me
and
to
do
some
repairing
within
and
without
they
were
certainly
the
most
inefficient
workmen
i
have
ever
seen
they
were
always
pottering
about
the
house
or
grounds
i
grew
weary
of
the
very
sight
of
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
was
always
in
my
sight
whatever
i
did
wherever
i
went
brane
felt
robbie
death
terribly
of
course
she
suffered
not
only
from
the
natural
grief
of
a
mother
but
from
a
morbid
fancy
that
in
some
way
the
tragedy
was
her
own
fault
i
should
have
taken
him
away
i
should
not
have
let
him
live
in
this
dreary
dreadful
house
what
was
anything
worth
compared
to
his
dear
life
what
is
anything
worth
to
me
now
there
was
again
the
suggestion
that
living
in
this
house
was
worth
something
i
should
have
discussed
all
these
matters
with
dabney
indeed
i
should
have
made
him
my
confidant
on
all
these
mysteries
which
confronted
me
had
it
not
been
for
his
harshness
on
that
dreadful
night
as
it
was
i
could
hardly
bear
to
look
at
him
hardly
bear
to
speak
to
him
and
yet
poor
wretched
girl
that
i
was
i
loved
him
more
than
ever
i
kept
on
with
my
work
of
dusting
books
and
he
kept
on
with
his
everlasting
notes
on
russian
literature
so
we
were
as
much
as
ever
in
each
other
company
but
what
a
sad
change
in
our
intercourse
the
shadow
of
sorrow
and
discomfort
that
lay
upon
the
pines
lay
heaviest
of
all
in
that
sunny
peaceful
bookroom
where
we
had
had
such
happy
hours
and
i
could
not
help
being
glad
of
his
presence
and
sometimes
i
found
his
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
such
a
look
of
doubt
of
dumb
and
miserable
feeling
i
was
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
him
in
those
days
i
think
that
in
the
end
i
should
have
done
so
with
what
result
i
can
not
even
now
imagine
had
it
not
been
first
for
the
episode
of
the
russian
baron
and
second
for
another
matter
infinitely
and
incomparably
more
dreadful
than
any
other
experience
of
my
life
the
russian
baron
came
to
the
pines
one
morning
about
ten
days
after
little
robbie
death
brane
received
him
in
the
and
presently
rang
the
bell
and
sent
sara
upstairs
with
a
message
for
me
i
came
down
at
once
the
baron
sat
opposite
to
brane
before
the
small
coal
fire
he
was
a
heavy
bearded
man
with
that
look
of
having
too
many
and
too
white
teeth
which
a
full
black
beard
gives
his
figure
reminded
me
of
a
bolster
it
was
round
and
narrow
and
without
any
shape
and
it
looked
soft
his
plump
hands
were
buttoned
into
gloves
which
he
had
not
removed
and
his
feet
were
encased
in
extravagantly
long
pointed
very
light
tan
shoes
he
kept
his
eyebrows
raised
and
his
eyes
opened
so
wide
that
the
whites
showed
above
the
iris
and
this
with
no
sense
of
effort
and
for
no
reason
whatever
it
disguised
every
possible
expression
except
one
of
entirely
unwarranted
extreme
surprise
at
first
when
i
came
into
the
room
i
thought
that
in
some
way
i
must
have
caused
the
look
but
i
soon
found
that
it
was
habitual
to
him
brane
looked
at
once
nervous
and
faintly
amused
miss
gale
she
said
this
is
baron
she
consulted
the
card
on
her
lap
he
was
a
friend
of
my
husband
when
my
husband
was
in
europe
and
he
too
like
dabney
wants
to
see
my
husband
collection
of
russian
the
baron
stood
up
and
made
me
a
bow
so
deep
that
i
discovered
his
hair
was
parted
down
the
back
mees
gale
said
the
baron
looking
up
at
me
while
he
bowed
he
suggested
the
contortions
of
a
trained
of
some
kind
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
show
him
the
books
miss
gale
went
on
brane
it
seems
to
be
one
of
your
principal
duties
in
the
house
does
it
and
i
certainly
did
not
engage
you
for
a
librarian
but
i
have
not
been
very
well
since
my
little
boy
died
her
lips
quivered
and
the
baron
gave
a
magnificent
deep
murmur
of
sympathy
his
unreasonably
astonished
eyes
being
fixed
meanwhile
upon
me
in
fact
he
had
stared
at
me
without
deviation
since
my
entrance
and
i
was
thoroughly
out
of
countenance
it
ees
true
that
i
should
not
have
intruded
myself
at
this
so
tragic
time
into
your
house
of
mourning
he
said
but
unfortunately
my
time
in
your
country
is
so
very
short
that
unless
i
come
at
this
juncture
i
should
not
be
able
to
come
at
all
and
so
i
understand
of
course
said
brane
rising
and
twisting
the
baron
card
in
her
hand
i
am
very
glad
you
came
will
you
not
take
dinner
with
us
this
evening
the
baron
looked
at
me
as
if
for
consent
or
advice
and
thinking
that
he
was
considering
his
hostess
health
i
made
a
motion
of
my
lips
of
no
at
which
he
promptly
but
very
politely
and
effusively
declined
her
hospitality
and
followed
me
out
of
the
room
young
dabney
met
us
in
the
hall
i
introduced
him
to
the
baron
who
turned
very
pale
quite
green
in
fact
i
was
astonished
at
this
loss
of
color
on
his
part
especially
as
dabney
was
extremely
polite
and
gentle
with
him
in
his
demure
way
and
strolled
beside
him
into
the
bookroom
chatting
in
the
most
friendly
fashion
and
reminding
me
of
his
manner
to
me
on
the
first
afternoon
of
our
acquaintance
the
baron
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
bookroom
peeling
off
his
gloves
as
though
his
hands
were
wet
his
forehead
certainly
was
and
he
stayed
green
and
kept
those
astonished
eyes
fixed
upon
me
so
that
i
felt
like
screaming
at
him
to
remove
them
paul
dabney
sat
on
the
window
seat
and
took
up
a
book
i
shall
be
perfectly
quiet
baron
he
said
and
not
disturb
your
he
was
admirably
quiet
but
i
could
not
help
but
see
that
he
did
very
little
reading
he
did
not
turn
a
page
but
sat
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
i
remembered
that
he
had
held
his
hand
just
that
way
on
the
night
of
robbie
death
one
of
the
outdoors
men
came
across
the
lawn
and
began
to
trim
the
vine
beside
one
of
the
open
windows
i
thought
the
baron
could
not
complain
of
any
too
much
privacy
for
his
researches
this
is
the
russian
library
i
said
and
led
the
way
to
the
shelves
he
followed
me
so
closely
that
i
could
feel
his
breath
on
my
neck
he
was
breathing
fast
and
rather
unevenly
thank
you
so
much
he
said
he
took
out
a
volume
and
rustled
the
pages
at
last
i
wonder
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
pursue
my
studies
with
no
other
assistance
than
yours
miss
gale
he
asked
irritably
he
wiped
his
forehead
i
am
a
student
a
recluse
it
is
a
folly
but
these
presences
he
pointed
towards
dabney
and
the
man
at
the
window
disturb
i
glanced
at
paul
dabney
who
smiled
and
came
down
from
his
window
seat
moving
towards
the
door
the
book
under
his
arm
his
hand
still
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
say
anything
but
went
out
quietly
and
nearly
closed
the
door
i
shut
it
quite
a
second
later
i
heard
him
speaking
to
the
man
outside
and
he
too
removed
himself
the
baron
gave
a
great
whistling
sigh
of
relief
ran
to
each
of
the
windows
in
turn
then
came
back
to
me
and
spoke
in
a
low
muttering
voice
you
are
incomparable
madame
he
said
i
was
perfectly
astonished
both
at
the
speech
and
the
manner
but
this
was
my
first
specimen
of
the
russian
nobility
and
supposing
that
it
was
the
aristocratic
russian
method
of
compliment
i
bowed
and
was
going
to
follow
dabney
out
when
the
baron
kneeling
by
the
bookcase
clutched
my
skirt
in
his
hand
you
will
not
leave
me
i
withdrew
my
skirt
from
his
grasp
not
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
you
baron
i
said
and
could
not
restrain
a
smile
he
was
so
absurd
help
moe
da
he
turned
from
me
and
began
rapidly
to
remove
all
the
books
from
the
bookcase
i
thought
this
a
peculiar
way
to
pursue
studies
especially
as
he
was
so
frightfully
quick
about
it
i
have
never
seen
any
one
so
marvellously
quick
with
his
hands
tumbling
the
books
down
one
after
the
other
when
the
case
was
entirely
empty
and
i
knew
that
i
should
have
the
work
of
filling
it
again
he
very
calmly
removed
a
shelf
and
began
feeling
with
his
fingers
along
the
back
of
the
case
i
stared
at
him
silent
and
fascinated
i
thought
him
harmlessly
insane
he
was
evidently
very
much
excited
he
tapped
with
his
fingers
perspiration
streamed
down
his
face
he
glanced
at
me
over
his
shoulder
you
see
he
said
it
is
back
there
do
you
hear
i
heard
that
his
tapping
produced
a
hollow
sound
what
are
you
about
i
asked
him
sternly
at
that
he
began
tumbling
the
books
back
in
their
places
as
feverishly
as
he
had
taken
them
out
in
an
incredibly
short
time
they
were
arranged
yes
yes
you
are
quite
right
he
said
as
though
my
bewildered
question
had
been
a
piece
of
advice
now
you
see
for
he
got
up
and
dusted
his
knees
it
is
much
safer
for
you
but
i
did
not
dare
to
trust
it
to
writing
you
have
however
much
better
opportunities
than
i
knew
it
will
be
in
russian
of
course
but
that
too
will
give
you
no
trouble
i
meant
to
contrive
a
meeting
with
maida
but
this
is
much
i
stared
at
him
the
jargon
made
no
sense
at
all
he
took
my
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
you
are
extraordinary
astonishing
such
youth
such
innocence
je
moe
how
is
it
done
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
and
muttered
something
in
russian
the
spitting
purring
tongue
which
i
detest
what
he
said
for
i
was
able
to
translate
it
sent
me
back
white
and
shaking
into
the
nearest
chair
it
will
not
be
long
eh
the
baron
had
sputtered
into
my
ear
before
the
young
man
too
is
found
with
three
of
those
golden
hairs
about
his
fingers
eh
i
sat
down
and
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hands
an
action
that
seemed
to
throw
him
into
a
convulsion
of
mirth
when
i
looked
up
the
abominable
grotesque
figure
was
gone
i
went
over
to
the
window
he
was
walking
rapidly
down
the
driveway
as
he
turned
the
corner
i
saw
a
man
step
from
the
side
of
the
road
and
saunter
after
him
it
was
one
of
the
outside
men
engaged
by
brane
i
ran
upstairs
to
my
own
room
and
sat
down
at
random
in
the
chair
before
my
and
rested
my
head
in
my
hands
i
sat
there
for
a
long
long
time
and
i
felt
that
i
was
fighting
against
a
mist
just
so
must
some
victim
dragonfly
struggle
with
the
dreadful
stickiness
of
the
spider
web
i
was
blinded
mentally
by
the
very
meshes
that
were
beginning
to
wrap
round
me
i
knew
now
that
i
was
in
great
danger
of
some
kind
that
i
was
being
played
with
by
sinister
and
evil
forces
that
perhaps
purposely
i
was
being
terrified
and
bewildered
and
mystified
there
was
none
whom
i
could
surely
count
for
a
friend
no
one
except
mary
and
how
could
she
or
any
one
else
understand
the
undefined
dreamlike
grotesque
forms
my
experiences
had
taken
brane
perhaps
was
the
person
for
me
to
take
into
my
confidence
and
yet
was
it
fair
to
frighten
her
when
she
was
so
delicate
already
one
person
too
many
had
been
frightened
in
that
house
dabney
was
my
enemy
no
matter
what
the
feeling
that
possessed
his
heart
his
brain
was
pitted
against
me
i
was
being
made
a
victim
a
but
how
and
by
whom
this
baron
had
treated
me
as
an
accomplice
he
had
showed
me
a
secret
he
had
made
to
me
a
horrible
suggestion
the
power
that
had
frightened
away
the
three
housekeepers
the
power
that
had
scared
delia
and
jane
and
annie
from
their
home
the
power
that
had
thrown
little
robbie
into
the
convulsions
that
caused
his
death
the
power
that
had
taken
every
one
but
me
and
the
lorrences
for
mary
now
slept
near
brane
out
of
the
northern
wing
this
power
was
threatening
paul
dabney
and
from
the
baron
whispered
words
i
understood
that
it
was
threatening
paul
dabney
through
me
was
it
not
a
supernatural
evil
was
i
not
perhaps
possessed
could
i
be
driven
to
commit
crimes
and
to
leave
as
evidence
against
myself
those
strands
of
hair
flesh
and
blood
could
not
bear
the
horror
of
all
this
i
would
go
to
dabney
at
once
with
this
resolution
to
comfort
me
i
rose
and
made
myself
ready
for
dinner
it
was
too
late
to
change
my
dress
but
brane
was
not
particular
as
to
our
dressing
for
dinner
besides
my
frock
was
neat
and
fresh
a
soft
gray
crêpe
with
wide
white
collar
and
cuffs
my
working
dresses
were
all
made
alike
and
trimmed
in
this
quaker
style
which
i
had
found
becoming
i
thought
that
in
spite
of
extreme
pallor
and
shadows
under
my
eyes
i
looked
rather
pretty
i
believe
that
was
the
last
evening
when
i
took
any
particular
pleasure
in
my
own
looks
i
was
rather
nervous
over
my
impending
interview
with
paul
dabney
and
it
was
with
a
certain
relief
that
i
heard
from
brane
in
the
diningroom
that
our
guest
had
gone
out
and
would
not
be
back
that
night
how
queer
it
seems
to
be
alone
again
she
said
but
i
thought
she
looked
more
alarmed
than
relieved
that
night
however
in
spite
of
her
timidity
she
was
in
better
spirits
than
i
had
seen
her
since
robbie
death
her
listlessness
was
not
quite
so
extreme
as
usual
she
even
chatted
about
her
youth
and
dances
she
used
to
go
to
she
must
have
been
as
pretty
as
a
fairy
and
she
had
evidently
been
something
of
a
belle
though
i
have
noticed
that
all
southern
women
see
themselves
in
retrospect
as
the
center
of
a
little
throng
of
suitors
mary
waited
on
us
for
henry
had
the
toothache
and
had
gone
to
bed
it
was
quite
a
cozy
and
cheerful
meal
in
spite
of
myself
the
disagreeable
impression
produced
by
the
baron
faded
a
little
from
my
mind
and
as
it
faded
another
feeling
began
to
strengthen
in
other
words
i
began
to
be
acutely
curious
about
the
hollow
sound
produced
by
tapping
on
the
back
of
that
bookcase
i
think
you
made
a
great
impression
on
the
baron
miss
gale
said
brane
teasingly
as
we
sat
at
our
coffee
in
the
he
really
seemed
unable
to
take
his
eyes
off
you
i
do
wonder
you
are
really
extraordinarily
pretty
in
an
odd
in
an
odd
way
i
could
help
asking
why
yes
you
are
the
pretty
girl
i
ever
seen
you
know
my
dear
if
i
should
catalogue
your
features
no
one
would
think
it
the
portrait
of
an
creature
it
would
sound
like
a
vixen
now
stiffen
up
your
vanity
and
she
looked
me
over
and
gave
me
this
description
you
have
fiery
hair
in
the
first
place
which
is
the
right
color
for
a
vixen
you
know
and
you
have
a
long
slender
pale
face
and
eyes
though
they
do
look
black
at
night
and
gray
sometimes
but
still
they
are
the
real
becky
sharp
color
and
no
mistake
you
have
very
thin
red
lips
and
if
their
expression
was
not
so
unmistakably
sweet
i
should
say
they
were
frightfully
capable
of
looking
cruel
and
well
yes
oh
brane
what
a
dreadful
portrait
what
did
i
tell
you
it
is
true
too
line
by
line
and
yet
you
are
quite
the
woman
i
have
ever
seen
miss
gale
come
now
you
must
see
the
impression
you
make
are
you
not
concerned
over
the
condition
of
poor
paul
dabney
i
have
not
noticed
his
condition
said
i
bitterly
she
shook
her
head
at
me
fibs
she
said
the
poor
boy
is
as
restless
as
a
hawk
he
is
getting
pale
and
thin
and
gaunt
he
eats
nothing
he
ca
let
you
out
of
his
if
he
is
consumed
by
love
of
me
i
said
it
is
strange
that
he
has
never
confided
to
me
as
to
his
but
has
he
really
janice
i
am
just
going
to
call
you
by
your
first
name
may
i
i
was
so
grateful
to
her
for
the
pretty
way
she
said
it
and
for
the
sweet
look
she
gave
me
that
i
kissed
the
hand
she
held
out
has
he
really
made
love
to
you
janice
i
could
have
sworn
that
during
all
those
hours
you
two
have
spent
in
the
bookroom
something
of
the
sort
was
going
nothing
of
the
sort
at
all
in
fact
brane
i
think
that
paul
dabney
dislikes
me
very
she
thought
this
over
stirring
her
coffee
absently
and
staring
into
the
coalfire
it
is
rather
mysterious
but
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
too
at
least
his
feeling
for
you
is
very
strong
one
way
or
the
other
sometimes
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
he
both
hates
and
loves
you
how
do
you
treat
him
janice
i
tried
to
avoid
her
eyes
not
any
way
at
all
i
stammered
that
is
just
the
way
i
feel
with
polite
brane
gave
a
little
trill
of
sad
laughter
oh
how
i
am
enjoying
this
nonsense
janice
i
have
talked
such
delicious
stuff
for
years
no
dear
you
do
treat
him
with
polite
indifference
at
all
you
treat
him
with
the
most
dreadful
and
crushing
and
stately
hauteur
imaginable
now
you
were
much
more
affable
with
the
i
gave
a
little
involuntary
shiver
how
ridiculous
that
creature
was
was
he
laughed
brane
i
could
hardly
keep
my
face
straight
as
i
looked
at
him
he
was
like
a
of
some
kind
he
did
seem
real
do
you
know
what
i
mean
i
wish
he
had
stayed
to
dinner
he
would
have
amused
he
did
amuse
me
i
said
positively
i
thought
he
was
poor
baron
borff
and
he
was
enamoured
you
have
a
very
hard
heart
janice
never
mind
when
i
get
rich
i
set
you
up
like
a
queen
you
must
not
be
a
housekeeper
always
even
if
you
do
refuse
to
be
a
baroness
you
did
know
i
had
hopes
of
wealth
did
you
she
looked
rather
sly
as
she
put
this
question
i
had
fancied
it
brane
i
said
she
looked
about
the
room
nervously
and
lowered
her
voice
it
is
so
queer
janice
she
said
then
she
moved
over
to
the
sofa
where
i
sat
and
spoke
very
low
indeed
it
is
so
queer
to
have
a
fortune
and
to
know
where
it
i
too
looked
anxiously
about
me
even
behind
me
where
there
was
no
possible
space
for
a
listener
if
you
would
only
tell
me
brane
i
began
earnestly
if
you
would
only
tell
me
something
about
this
fortune
of
yours
i
feel
that
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
brane
does
any
one
know
dabney
for
instance
no
she
murmured
i
have
never
told
any
one
i
ought
not
to
tell
oh
mary
is
that
you
how
you
made
me
jump
i
suppose
yes
said
mary
and
past
bedtime
do
you
want
to
get
strong
and
well
brane
she
laughed
and
stood
up
obediently
gave
me
a
look
that
said
hush
and
followed
mary
out
i
took
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
after
an
hour
or
two
oppressed
by
the
dead
stillness
of
the
house
i
went
upstairs
to
my
own
room
but
i
did
not
undress
the
most
overwhelming
desire
possessed
me
suddenly
to
go
down
to
the
bookroom
and
to
discover
if
i
could
the
secret
of
the
bookcase
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
there
is
the
blood
of
adventurers
in
my
veins
danger
is
a
real
temptation
to
me
danger
and
the
devious
way
i
would
rather
i
believe
be
playing
with
peril
than
not
the
house
was
very
silent
i
was
alone
in
the
old
wing
my
nerves
had
been
badly
shaken
only
that
afternoon
but
i
was
keen
for
adventure
curiosity
was
far
stronger
than
my
fears
i
took
off
my
shoes
and
opened
the
door
a
faint
light
shone
at
the
far
end
of
the
passage
the
night
light
that
brane
had
been
burning
there
since
robbie
death
i
walked
along
the
hallway
to
the
stairs
i
had
never
realized
before
how
noiseless
one
may
be
in
stocking
feet
nor
how
noisy
an
old
floor
is
of
itself
under
the
quietest
step
boards
snapped
under
me
like
pistol
shots
but
no
one
in
the
sleeping
house
seemed
the
wiser
for
my
stealthy
passing
i
got
down
the
stairs
and
found
my
way
into
the
bookroom
saw
that
the
shutters
were
all
tightly
fastened
and
the
shades
drawn
down
then
i
lighted
the
near
the
russian
collection
and
knelt
before
it
on
the
floor
i
began
quietly
to
take
out
the
books
as
i
had
seen
the
baron
take
them
i
had
removed
perhaps
half
a
dozen
from
the
middle
shelf
when
the
strangest
feeling
made
me
look
around
the
door
of
the
bookroom
was
open
and
i
had
left
it
shut
i
rose
to
my
feet
at
the
same
instant
something
just
outside
the
threshold
of
the
door
seemed
to
rise
to
its
feet
i
looked
at
it
was
there
is
no
way
of
describing
the
horror
of
such
a
sight
this
figure
wore
my
dress
of
gray
with
its
quaker
collar
and
cuffs
its
long
slender
face
was
framed
in
fiery
hair
its
eyes
narrow
and
were
fixed
on
mine
there
was
no
mirror
outside
of
that
door
besides
no
mirror
could
have
reflected
the
look
of
white
damnation
that
possessed
this
face
haggard
and
hard
and
vile
with
a
wicked
stony
leer
in
the
eyes
with
a
wicked
tight
smile
on
the
lips
with
a
blasted
devastated
look
too
dreadful
to
describe
it
faced
me
and
it
was
myself
as
i
might
have
been
after
a
lifetime
of
crime
and
cruelty
i
stood
and
looked
at
it
till
a
black
cloud
seemed
to
roll
up
over
it
from
which
for
a
second
its
evil
countenance
smiled
imperturbably
at
me
then
the
face
too
was
blotted
out
and
i
fell
down
on
the
floor
chapter
viii
a
dangerous
game
came
to
my
senses
i
looked
up
slowly
the
thing
was
gone
i
put
out
the
light
and
fled
like
a
hunted
creature
to
my
room
there
i
locked
myself
in
and
dropped
down
on
my
knees
beside
my
bed
at
first
it
was
entirely
a
battle
with
fear
that
kept
me
rigid
and
silent
on
my
knees
i
knew
that
unless
i
overcame
the
extremity
of
my
nervous
terror
i
should
lose
my
mind
if
i
went
out
of
my
room
at
all
it
would
be
to
go
raving
and
shrieking
down
the
hall
and
to
alarm
the
house
was
possible
only
if
i
should
stay
here
and
conquer
the
evil
spirit
of
the
pines
conquer
its
effect
upon
my
own
steadiness
and
i
would
not
repeat
the
grotesque
of
jane
and
delia
and
annie
and
present
myself
gasping
and
to
brane
demanding
my
dismissal
on
the
spot
neither
would
i
be
like
the
other
three
housekeepers
even
in
that
moment
of
prostration
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
was
not
utterly
a
victim
the
demon
that
had
possessed
the
house
had
to
a
certain
extent
already
met
its
match
in
me
of
course
during
those
first
hours
i
did
entertain
the
belief
that
i
was
possessed
by
a
denizen
from
another
world
who
had
come
to
this
house
to
terrify
and
to
kill
and
had
borrowed
my
astral
body
for
its
clothing
a
horrid
idea
enough
and
not
unnatural
under
the
circumstances
if
i
remember
rightly
i
decided
that
if
the
awful
figure
came
again
or
if
any
other
tragedy
should
happen
at
the
pines
i
should
kill
myself
fortunately
my
reason
though
badly
shaken
did
at
least
reassert
itself
after
all
i
am
not
a
natural
believer
in
ghosts
the
supernatural
has
never
greatly
interested
or
impressed
me
it
is
not
so
i
am
skeptical
as
that
i
am
pragmatic
that
is
i
have
to
discern
some
use
or
meaning
in
spiritual
experiences
it
is
this
turn
of
mind
inherited
i
think
from
my
french
father
that
saved
me
now
very
gradually
as
i
knelt
there
in
that
attitude
of
prayer
an
attitude
whose
subjective
benefit
to
the
human
race
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
measure
an
attitude
which
in
its
humility
in
its
resignation
in
its
shutting
out
of
this
world
light
so
opens
the
inner
eyes
of
the
soul
as
i
knelt
there
my
mood
began
to
change
from
one
of
insane
superstition
and
fear
to
one
of
quiet
and
most
determined
thought
in
fact
my
reason
reasserted
itself
and
powerfully
one
by
one
all
the
alarming
incidents
began
to
link
themselves
together
to
suggest
a
plan
a
logical
whole
it
was
as
though
with
my
eyes
shut
and
hidden
in
my
hands
i
saw
for
the
first
time
three
housekeepers
one
after
the
other
had
been
frightened
away
from
the
the
old
servants
of
the
house
had
been
forced
also
by
supernatural
fears
to
leave
a
most
determined
attempt
had
been
made
against
robbie
nerves
and
mary
courage
and
now
at
the
climax
of
the
crescendo
for
then
it
seemed
to
me
god
forgive
me
that
my
experience
had
been
worse
than
robbie
death
i
the
fourth
housekeeper
was
being
terrified
almost
out
of
my
wits
all
these
things
pointed
to
one
conclusion
it
was
somebody
interest
to
isolate
little
brane
it
was
especially
somebody
interest
to
frighten
every
one
away
from
the
northern
wing
somewhere
in
this
house
and
presumably
in
this
part
of
the
house
there
was
something
enormously
valuable
something
to
tempt
evil
spirits
clad
in
substantial
flesh
and
blood
as
substantial
for
instance
as
that
of
the
figure
of
the
baron
and
the
leader
of
this
enterprise
the
was
a
with
hair
and
a
face
like
my
own
this
was
a
horrid
thought
in
itself
and
almost
an
incredible
one
but
it
was
at
least
not
supernatural
the
creature
that
had
seemed
to
rise
up
on
the
threshold
of
the
bookroom
was
a
living
being
a
woman
of
flesh
and
blood
i
repeated
this
over
and
over
to
myself
i
felt
that
i
must
possess
my
mind
perfectly
of
this
fact
and
lay
hold
of
it
so
that
no
future
manifestations
might
so
nearly
drive
me
to
distraction
as
the
manifestation
of
she
was
a
real
woman
a
female
criminal
wily
and
brave
and
very
cunning
she
had
deliberately
made
use
of
this
extraordinary
chance
resemblance
had
artfully
heightened
it
had
copied
my
habitual
costume
for
excellent
reasons
of
her
own
it
was
probably
entirely
by
her
agency
that
i
had
been
brought
to
the
with
a
blinding
realization
of
my
own
stupidity
i
remembered
the
suspicious
fashion
in
which
i
had
learned
of
the
position
a
slip
of
paper
handed
to
me
on
the
street
i
had
been
chosen
deliberately
for
my
resemblance
by
this
thief
for
a
double
purpose
of
mystification
and
of
diverting
suspicion
what
more
convenient
for
a
than
to
possess
a
double
in
some
authorized
inmate
of
the
house
why
she
might
walk
up
and
down
the
house
in
broad
daylight
and
providing
only
that
she
was
careful
not
to
be
seen
simultaneously
with
me
nor
at
too
close
intervals
of
time
at
an
unreasonable
distance
from
my
known
whereabouts
she
might
stand
at
brane
elbow
or
flit
past
mary
down
the
stairs
or
go
through
the
kitchen
under
sara
lorrence
very
nose
more
light
here
broke
upon
me
so
brilliantly
that
it
brought
me
to
my
feet
i
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
fever
of
excited
thought
i
knew
now
why
henry
lorrence
and
the
woman
who
called
herself
his
wife
cringed
when
they
met
my
eye
whitened
at
my
lightest
reproof
and
at
the
same
time
could
barely
repress
that
leer
of
evil
understanding
they
too
had
been
brought
to
the
they
were
members
of
the
gang
of
which
my
double
was
the
leader
only
and
this
cleared
up
a
whole
fog
of
mystery
they
did
not
know
the
secret
of
the
dual
personality
they
thought
that
the
criminal
and
the
housekeeper
were
one
and
the
same
person
under
a
different
they
were
evidently
under
strict
orders
not
to
betray
even
by
a
word
or
look
even
when
there
was
no
one
by
their
knowledge
of
collusion
with
brane
reputed
housekeeper
but
sara
had
made
a
bad
slip
she
had
spoken
of
instruction
and
she
had
said
that
she
had
not
expected
to
see
me
come
out
of
the
kitchen
closet
in
the
daytime
my
god
what
danger
we
were
all
in
while
we
shivered
and
shook
over
ghosts
and
nightmares
light
footsteps
in
the
wall
and
draughts
of
cold
air
going
by
a
dangerous
gang
of
thieves
had
actually
taken
up
its
abode
with
us
one
of
them
was
hiding
somewhere
in
the
old
house
the
others
served
us
walked
about
amongst
us
took
our
orders
spoke
to
us
discreetly
with
soft
voices
and
hypocritical
lowered
eyes
we
were
entirely
at
their
mercy
and
the
only
suspecting
person
in
the
house
paul
dabney
suspected
undoubtedly
he
too
had
explained
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
mystery
of
the
pines
and
explanation
was
janice
gale
he
knew
nothing
about
me
but
he
did
he
must
know
something
about
brane
mysterious
fortune
bobbie
nightmares
the
strand
of
hair
about
his
little
fingers
were
evidence
enough
against
my
innocence
i
might
be
a
he
could
not
prove
that
i
was
not
but
in
his
heart
he
believed
me
to
be
a
with
a
purpose
he
was
watching
me
playing
amateur
detective
in
the
house
he
had
constituted
himself
a
guardian
of
brane
perhaps
he
was
in
love
with
her
you
see
this
is
not
only
the
history
of
the
pine
cone
mystery
it
is
the
history
of
my
love
for
paul
dabney
this
must
be
understood
for
it
explains
my
actions
the
part
i
managed
to
play
which
it
astounds
me
even
now
to
think
that
i
was
able
to
play
would
barely
have
been
possible
without
the
goad
of
my
bitterness
and
pain
and
anger
i
would
have
gone
at
once
to
paul
dabney
and
have
told
him
everything
i
knew
and
let
him
call
in
outside
help
but
ever
since
he
had
held
me
by
the
wrist
and
in
spite
of
his
very
apparent
mental
abhorrence
for
me
had
taken
me
into
his
arms
my
pride
was
up
i
would
fight
this
thing
through
alone
i
would
make
no
appeal
to
him
rather
i
would
save
the
household
myself
and
when
i
had
exposed
the
real
criminal
and
shamed
paul
dabney
cruelty
to
a
lonely
girl
and
humbled
him
in
his
conceit
i
would
go
away
and
begin
life
again
as
far
as
possible
from
him
this
resolution
utterly
possessed
me
under
its
spur
i
began
to
think
with
great
lucidity
i
suppose
it
was
then
at
about
four
on
that
november
morning
with
the
quiet
house
sleeping
around
me
and
the
quiet
world
outside
just
faintly
turning
gray
with
dawn
that
i
began
to
see
the
weapon
which
lay
within
my
grasp
it
was
a
matter
of
turning
the
situation
upside
down
in
fact
if
we
did
that
more
often
with
our
mental
tangles
if
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
train
of
thought
we
made
a
and
from
looking
at
things
from
our
own
obvious
viewpoint
we
suddenly
chose
a
right
angle
for
contemplation
i
am
sure
there
would
be
many
illuminations
similar
to
mine
that
night
but
i
did
not
make
any
deliberately
it
was
a
sort
of
accident
quite
suddenly
i
saw
the
situation
as
though
i
were
a
criminal
myself
a
criminal
or
a
sleuth
the
mental
attitude
must
be
in
some
respects
the
same
what
advantage
did
this
fantastic
resemblance
give
the
woman
downstairs
that
it
did
not
also
give
me
now
you
have
it
the
whole
astounding
situation
you
see
what
decision
i
was
coming
to
i
would
deliberately
play
out
the
dangerous
game
for
the
woman
benefit
i
would
pretend
that
i
believed
the
apparition
to
be
ghostlike
dreamlike
the
fabrication
of
my
own
feverish
mind
but
to
sara
and
henry
and
any
other
barons
that
might
visit
us
i
would
play
my
vixen
as
skilfully
as
informingly
as
heaven
and
my
own
wits
and
courage
would
let
me
i
would
discover
the
whereabouts
of
brane
fortune
i
would
save
it
for
her
and
i
would
trap
the
thieves
that
was
my
resolve
the
fruit
of
my
night
vigil
having
made
it
i
undressed
myself
and
went
to
bed
i
fell
asleep
at
once
like
an
overwearied
child
chapter
ix
maida
was
surprised
to
find
when
i
examined
myself
in
the
glass
next
morning
that
i
did
not
look
like
a
person
that
has
seen
a
ghost
i
had
rather
more
color
than
usual
and
my
eyes
were
bright
also
the
fact
that
i
had
controlled
and
overcome
my
nerves
seemed
to
have
acted
like
a
tonic
to
my
whole
system
in
some
mysterious
way
i
had
tapped
a
whole
reservoir
of
nervous
strength
and
resilience
the
same
thing
often
happens
physically
one
is
tired
to
the
very
point
of
exhaustion
one
goes
on
there
is
a
renewal
of
strength
the
effort
that
seems
about
to
crack
the
muscles
suddenly
lightens
becomes
almost
easy
again
i
suppose
the
nervous
system
is
subject
to
the
same
rules
at
any
rate
in
my
case
the
explanation
works
without
any
exaggerated
horror
i
dressed
again
in
my
quaker
costume
and
i
went
down
to
breakfast
there
must
have
been
something
in
my
face
however
for
brane
after
we
had
had
our
coffee
began
to
look
at
me
rather
searchingly
and
at
last
she
said
you
are
getting
very
thin
janice
do
you
know
that
i
had
noticed
it
not
perhaps
at
all
certainly
your
gown
is
beginning
to
hang
on
you
and
your
face
is
just
a
wedge
between
all
that
hair
you
look
a
little
feverish
too
suppose
you
try
to
take
a
little
more
exercise
and
fresh
air
after
all
keeping
house
at
pines
does
not
demand
so
much
strenuous
desk
work
does
it
and
now
that
paul
dabney
is
away
you
can
neglect
that
endless
library
has
he
gone
for
good
i
asked
as
lightly
as
possible
though
my
heart
fell
no
my
dear
you
will
still
be
able
to
torment
him
with
your
proud
looks
and
ways
he
is
coming
back
this
evening
on
the
afternoon
train
he
be
late
for
tea
but
we
wait
for
him
shall
we
he
did
want
to
be
met
said
he
would
walk
up
i
think
he
dreads
that
long
poky
ride
with
old
george
nursing
old
gregory
through
the
sand
when
you
a
young
man
who
flies
about
the
country
in
a
motor
vehicle
must
be
an
instrument
of
torture
janice
suppose
you
put
on
your
cloak
and
hat
and
come
out
with
me
for
a
nice
long
walk
it
would
do
us
both
good
i
have
had
any
heart
for
exercise
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
live
for
now
but
haverstock
you
think
haverstock
something
to
live
for
i
asked
rather
puzzled
she
laughed
a
little
and
blushed
a
great
deal
mercy
no
i
meant
to
say
haverstock
has
told
me
that
i
must
take
more
exercise
i
do
know
why
i
stopped
that
way
i
was
looking
through
the
window
at
one
of
those
do
you
think
they
are
very
useful
members
of
society
brane
they
seem
to
do
very
little
she
gave
me
an
odd
look
they
think
they
are
useful
poor
fellows
they
are
my
pet
oh
said
i
blankly
i
was
not
sure
whether
she
was
joking
or
not
come
on
janice
do
worry
your
head
over
my
extravagances
your
duty
is
just
to
be
a
nice
cheerful
young
companion
for
me
it
a
help
to
me
to
see
that
fiery
gold
head
of
yours
moving
about
this
musty
old
house
do
wear
your
hat
it
not
cold
and
i
love
to
see
the
sun
on
your
i
tried
to
suppress
my
little
shiver
but
could
she
interpreted
it
very
naturally
however
oh
it
is
a
bit
cold
not
a
so
we
went
out
into
the
mild
soft
day
and
i
went
without
my
hat
for
the
sake
of
letting
her
see
the
sun
on
my
hair
as
we
walked
down
the
drive
on
which
the
labors
of
the
two
men
had
made
little
or
no
impression
i
wondered
if
narrow
green
eyes
under
a
mass
of
just
such
hair
were
watching
us
from
some
secret
post
of
observation
i
thought
that
i
could
feel
them
boring
into
my
back
i
could
not
restrain
a
backward
look
the
old
house
stood
quietly
its
long
windows
blank
except
for
an
upper
one
out
of
which
sara
was
shaking
a
pillow
i
wondered
why
she
should
be
working
in
the
nursery
but
i
did
like
to
draw
brane
attention
to
the
fact
to
my
surprise
brane
was
a
very
energetic
walker
she
stepped
along
briskly
on
her
tiny
feet
and
a
faint
color
came
into
her
poor
wistful
face
i
should
be
a
different
person
janice
she
sighed
if
i
could
get
away
from
this
place
and
live
in
some
more
bracing
climate
or
some
more
cheerful
country
how
lovely
paris
would
be
she
laughed
her
hollow
little
laugh
my
husband
lived
in
paris
for
a
long
time
before
that
he
was
in
russia
he
knew
a
great
deal
of
russian
even
dialects
he
was
a
great
traveler
i
met
him
at
he
was
taking
the
baths
and
so
was
i
we
were
both
invalids
and
i
suppose
it
was
a
sort
of
bond
but
invalids
should
not
be
allowed
to
marry
of
course
we
had
no
serious
disease
it
was
rheumatism
with
him
and
nervous
prostration
with
me
i
wonder
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
i
wondered
absently
i
was
busy
with
my
own
thoughts
and
she
was
a
great
chatterer
i
think
old
houses
get
saturated
with
truly
i
do
the
real
explanation
of
ghosts
i
am
sure
rooms
are
haunted
by
the
sorrows
and
mournful
preoccupations
of
the
people
that
die
in
them
i
am
not
very
superstitious
and
i
am
so
glad
that
you
are
i
trembled
for
you
you
see
those
other
housekeepers
do
tell
me
about
the
other
housekeepers
i
begged
especially
the
one
just
before
me
what
was
she
like
oh
a
little
fat
thing
white
as
wax
very
bustling
but
with
no
real
ability
she
stayed
with
me
for
some
time
though
and
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
you
know
janice
i
owe
you
an
why
dear
brane
because
i
never
told
you
about
those
three
housekeepers
and
their
alarms
it
was
rather
shabby
of
me
not
to
warn
you
but
you
see
i
did
want
to
suggest
fears
to
you
i
hope
i
wo
suggest
them
now
but
all
my
other
housekeepers
have
been
haunted
i
asked
with
as
much
surprise
as
i
could
assume
yes
the
first
heard
a
voice
in
the
wall
and
the
second
knew
that
some
one
was
in
her
room
at
night
the
third
was
so
badly
frightened
that
she
would
tell
me
what
happened
at
where
is
she
now
i
do
know
she
went
away
leaving
me
no
address
and
i
never
heard
a
word
of
her
since
at
first
i
thought
she
might
have
made
away
with
something
some
money
or
jewelry
but
i
have
never
missed
mrs
brane
i
asked
hesitatingly
what
is
your
explanation
of
these
apparitions
of
the
things
that
alarmed
the
housekeepers
of
the
things
that
frightened
delia
and
annie
and
jane
as
we
talked
we
had
been
coming
down
the
long
hill
on
top
of
which
stood
the
pines
and
now
were
beginning
to
go
towards
that
swamp
with
its
black
smothered
stream
across
which
george
had
driven
me
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
i
did
not
like
the
direction
of
our
walk
i
did
not
like
the
swamp
nor
my
memory
of
the
stream
under
the
twisted
sprawling
trees
draped
with
spanish
moss
but
i
supposed
it
was
brane
business
and
not
mine
besides
i
was
now
interested
in
what
she
was
saying
she
listened
to
my
question
and
seemed
to
ponder
her
reply
rather
doubtfully
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
to
some
measure
of
frankness
of
course
i
have
a
sort
of
explanation
of
my
own
for
their
leaving
she
said
rather
a
suspicion
than
an
explanation
but
janice
she
looked
about
her
drew
closer
and
spoke
very
low
if
i
tell
you
this
suspicion
you
must
promise
to
keep
it
very
strictly
to
yourself
i
am
going
against
orders
in
speaking
of
it
at
all
and
against
my
own
resolution
too
but
i
feel
as
if
i
must
have
a
confidante
and
i
do
think
that
you
are
a
person
to
be
oh
brane
i
said
indeed
indeed
i
am
you
will
not
be
sorry
if
you
tell
me
everything
everything
that
has
to
do
with
these
queer
happenings
at
pines
we
came
down
the
sandy
slope
to
the
bridge
and
on
it
we
paused
leaning
against
the
rail
and
looking
far
down
at
the
sluggish
gray
water
the
black
roots
of
the
trees
crawled
down
into
it
like
snakes
from
the
banks
it
was
the
stillest
water
i
have
ever
seen
just
underneath
this
bridge
there
is
a
quicksand
said
brane
a
mule
was
lost
here
two
years
ago
and
a
poor
negress
killed
herself
by
letting
herself
drop
down
from
the
bridge
was
it
a
dreadful
death
to
choose
slow
and
suffocating
ugh
i
hate
this
place
i
said
half
angrily
why
do
we
stay
here
let
go
and
do
our
talking
somewhere
i
have
a
fancy
to
tell
you
here
she
half
laughed
the
laugh
ended
in
a
little
shriek
janice
there
some
one
under
the
bridge
i
clutched
the
rail
and
leaned
forward
though
god
knows
i
was
in
no
mind
for
horrid
sights
this
was
neither
horrid
nor
ghostly
however
no
drowned
negress
haunting
the
scene
of
her
death
the
discreet
bewhiskered
face
of
henry
lorrence
looked
respectfully
up
at
us
he
was
squatting
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
under
the
shadow
of
the
bridge
his
coat
lay
beside
him
and
he
was
busy
with
some
tools
what
are
you
doing
henry
asked
brane
in
rather
a
shrill
voice
she
had
been
startled
mendin
up
the
bridge
said
henry
thickly
for
his
mouth
was
full
of
nails
there
a
couple
of
weak
planks
here
that
i
noticed
the
other
afternoon
and
they
seemed
to
me
dangerous
to
life
and
limb
over
this
here
stream
at
such
a
height
if
a
person
fell
through
there
would
be
much
chance
for
him
would
there
i
should
think
not
you
quite
better
wait
till
i
got
it
fixed
before
you
goes
acrost
it
will
be
a
matter
of
a
few
hours
and
i
ai
will
be
safe
then
the
whole
bridge
should
be
we
stay
on
this
side
said
brane
we
can
go
back
and
walk
along
the
ridge
i
do
think
the
air
is
particularly
healthy
down
in
this
swamp
anyway
even
at
this
time
of
the
year
we
wo
be
back
this
way
henry
make
a
good
job
of
yes
said
henry
with
one
of
his
servile
smiles
i
mean
to
make
a
regular
good
he
began
to
hammer
away
vigorously
he
had
quite
an
assortment
of
tools
a
saw
and
an
axe
and
some
planks
it
really
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
make
a
thorough
good
job
of
it
and
i
hoped
he
would
a
fall
through
the
bridge
into
that
thick
gray
turbid
water
with
its
faint
odor
of
rottenness
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
and
even
a
very
loud
crying
for
help
would
not
reach
the
there
was
no
nearer
place
and
the
road
led
only
to
us
not
a
nice
spot
for
an
accident
at
all
brane
and
i
hastened
back
to
the
higher
ground
where
we
found
a
path
soft
with
pine
needles
where
the
sunlight
sifted
through
wide
branches
to
the
hushed
earth
you
see
she
said
there
is
no
safe
place
for
confidence
if
i
had
not
happened
to
see
henry
at
just
that
instant
he
would
have
heard
my
suspicions
and
heaven
knows
what
effect
they
might
have
had
on
his
dull
honest
old
mind
an
honest
old
mind
indeed
if
my
own
suspicions
were
correct
i
wondered
if
the
whiskers
were
false
henry
was
really
too
perfect
an
image
of
the
reliable
old
family
servant
he
might
have
been
copied
from
a
book
well
here
we
can
look
about
us
at
any
rate
i
said
there
no
place
for
eavesdroppers
to
hide
after
all
there
is
so
much
to
tell
if
i
knew
more
why
then
there
would
be
no
mystery
and
i
should
be
safely
away
from
pines
you
see
i
suspect
that
there
has
been
an
attempt
at
burglary
which
has
an
attempt
at
burglary
oh
brane
this
was
almost
as
perfect
an
imitation
of
the
stereotyped
exclamation
of
perfect
ignorance
as
was
of
the
english
i
blushed
at
it
but
brane
did
not
notice
my
husband
died
of
paralysis
a
sudden
stroke
he
could
not
speak
and
that
is
why
i
have
never
been
able
to
leave
pines
i
do
understand
said
i
honestly
this
time
of
course
you
do
you
see
there
were
secrets
in
my
husband
life
he
had
an
adventurous
past
i
fear
he
was
very
she
sighed
but
i
could
see
that
his
wildness
was
a
pleasure
to
her
she
was
one
of
those
foolish
women
to
whose
sheltered
virtue
the
fancy
picture
of
daring
vice
appeals
very
strongly
i
was
far
wiser
than
she
there
were
some
sordid
memories
in
my
life
when
he
married
me
he
was
a
man
of
quite
and
he
reformed
completely
i
think
he
had
had
a
shock
a
fright
of
some
kind
which
served
as
a
warning
sometimes
i
fancied
that
he
lived
under
a
dread
of
trouble
certainly
he
was
very
watchful
and
secret
in
his
ways
and
from
being
such
a
he
became
the
veriest
he
never
left
pines
winter
or
summer
though
he
would
send
robbie
and
me
away
she
gave
the
pitiful
little
sigh
that
came
always
now
with
robbie
name
he
was
not
at
all
rich
though
we
were
sufficiently
comfortable
on
my
small
fortune
but
at
times
he
talked
like
a
very
wealthy
man
he
made
plans
he
was
very
strange
about
it
at
last
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
began
to
drop
hints
he
would
tell
me
that
some
day
robbie
would
be
rich
beyond
dreams
that
if
he
died
i
would
be
left
provided
for
like
a
queen
he
said
always
very
fearfully
very
stealthily
that
he
had
left
everything
to
me
everything
and
of
course
i
thought
i
knew
that
he
had
very
little
to
leave
he
said
that
i
must
be
braver
than
he
had
been
a
little
caution
edna
a
very
little
caution
you
can
reap
the
fruits
of
it
all
of
course
i
questioned
him
but
he
teased
me
and
pretended
that
he
had
been
talking
nonsense
he
made
his
will
though
at
about
this
time
and
left
me
everything
he
had
everything
and
he
underlined
the
one
night
we
were
sitting
at
dinner
he
had
been
perfectly
well
all
day
but
he
had
taken
a
ride
in
the
sun
and
complained
of
a
slight
headache
we
had
wine
for
dinner
i
never
been
able
to
touch
a
drop
since
is
it
odd
suddenly
while
he
was
talking
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
feel
queer
he
said
and
his
voice
was
thick
he
grabbed
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
me
i
had
better
tell
you
now
edna
the
words
were
all
heavy
and
blurred
is
in
the
house
you
know
the
old
part
he
stood
up
went
over
to
the
door
closed
it
carefully
he
looked
into
the
pantry
to
be
sure
that
the
waitress
was
not
there
he
came
back
and
stood
beside
my
chair
looking
down
at
me
his
face
was
flushed
will
find
the
paper
he
began
and
then
the
words
began
to
come
queer
he
struggled
with
them
his
tongue
seemed
to
stick
to
his
mouth
suddenly
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
down
on
the
brane
wiped
her
eyes
poor
theodore
poor
fellow
he
never
spoke
again
he
lived
for
several
days
and
his
eyes
followed
me
about
so
anxiously
so
yearningly
but
he
was
entirely
helpless
could
not
move
a
finger
could
not
make
a
sound
he
died
and
left
me
tormented
by
the
secret
that
he
could
not
tell
it
has
been
like
a
curse
it
been
a
curse
it
has
killed
robbie
i
believe
that
it
will
some
day
kill
here
the
poor
woman
sank
down
on
a
log
and
cried
i
comforted
her
as
well
as
i
could
and
begged
her
to
forget
this
miserable
business
no
problematic
fortune
is
worth
so
much
misery
and
distress
i
said
and
if
in
all
this
time
in
spite
of
your
searching
and
i
suppose
you
have
searched
very
thoroughly
oh
yes
she
sighed
i
have
worn
myself
out
with
it
every
scrap
of
paper
in
the
house
has
been
gone
over
a
hundred
times
every
drawer
and
closet
why
since
sara
stirred
me
up
with
her
cleaning
in
the
old
part
of
the
house
i
have
been
over
everything
again
during
this
last
fortnight
but
with
not
the
slightest
you
see
it
is
useless
and
dear
brane
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
suggesting
it
but
perhaps
the
whole
idea
is
a
mistake
or
some
fantastic
obsession
of
your
husband
mind
he
was
ill
towards
the
last
probably
more
ill
than
you
knew
you
may
be
wasting
your
health
and
life
in
the
pursuit
of
a
mere
chimera
you
have
no
further
suspicions
of
any
attempt
at
burglary
have
you
my
words
had
had
some
effect
she
stood
up
and
began
to
walk
home
thoughtfully
and
calmly
no
there
have
been
no
disturbances
for
a
long
time
sara
and
henry
have
not
been
frightened
nor
have
you
mary
has
seen
no
ghosts
perhaps
you
are
right
dear
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
she
sighed
one
does
not
relinquish
the
hope
of
a
fabulous
fortune
without
a
sigh
we
were
rather
silent
on
the
way
home
i
was
planning
an
interview
with
sara
my
first
move
in
the
difficult
and
dangerous
game
that
i
had
set
myself
to
play
i
was
frightened
yes
but
terribly
interested
i
left
brane
after
lunch
and
went
down
to
the
kitchen
sara
was
seated
by
the
table
peeling
potatoes
the
most
commonplace
and
respectable
of
figures
she
lifted
her
large
handsome
face
and
stood
up
setting
down
the
bowl
go
on
with
your
work
sara
i
said
i
shall
not
keep
you
but
a
she
sat
down
and
i
stood
there
my
hand
resting
on
the
table
my
heart
was
beating
fast
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
tightening
in
my
throat
unconsciously
i
narrowed
my
eyes
and
tightened
my
lips
till
my
expression
must
have
been
something
like
that
mask
of
wickedness
i
had
seen
in
the
doorway
of
the
i
spoke
in
a
low
hard
voice
level
and
cruel
and
i
put
my
whole
theory
to
the
test
at
once
foolishly
enough
i
think
for
i
might
have
given
myself
away
if
my
guess
had
not
been
correct
in
this
detail
how
goes
it
i
asked
it
was
the
name
the
baron
had
used
she
started
the
knife
stopped
its
work
she
looked
up
glancing
nervously
about
the
room
god
she
said
you
gettin
nervy
ai
you
no
speech
could
have
been
more
unlike
the
speech
of
the
smooth
and
respectful
sara
i
smiled
as
evilly
as
i
could
once
in
a
while
i
take
a
risk
all
do
refer
to
it
again
but
answer
my
questions
will
you
anything
new
god
no
i
about
done
with
this
game
housework
is
no
holiday
to
me
and
since
they
nabbed
the
nobleman
my
heart
gone
out
of
me
our
about
up
unless
we
get
that
here
she
used
a
string
of
vile
whispered
epithets
this
afternoon
and
i
do
think
it
likely
got
nine
lives
that
cat
of
a
hovey
my
heart
thumped
i
dared
not
ask
her
meaning
sara
went
on
only
it
was
certainly
maida
that
spoke
in
the
coarse
breathless
furtive
voice
if
the
nobleman
has
talked
they
coming
back
for
us
there
a
dozen
chances
the
bridge
trick
wo
work
and
even
if
it
does
the
whole
pack
will
be
down
here
to
investigate
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
that
we
need
just
free
hours
to
pull
the
thing
off
but
i
tell
you
what
madam
jaffrey
and
me
are
gettin
pretty
sick
we
like
a
glimpse
of
them
one
phrase
of
this
speech
had
struck
me
deaf
and
half
blind
i
made
a
sign
of
caution
to
the
horrible
creature
and
i
went
out
i
stopped
in
the
hall
to
look
at
the
tall
grandfather
clock
ticking
loudly
and
solemnly
it
was
already
very
nearly
five
paul
dabney
train
was
in
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
i
stood
there
stupidly
repeating
the
bridge
trick
over
and
over
to
myself
the
bridge
trick
henry
had
had
a
saw
and
an
axe
he
might
just
as
easily
have
been
weakening
a
plank
as
strengthening
it
had
it
not
been
for
my
presence
his
entire
reliance
on
my
skill
in
diverting
brane
suspicion
we
should
not
have
seen
him
at
his
work
but
thinking
me
his
leader
the
real
instigator
of
the
crime
he
had
probably
decided
that
for
some
reason
i
had
brought
brane
purposely
to
watch
him
at
his
task
it
was
five
paul
dabney
would
be
near
the
bridge
he
was
probably
bringing
with
him
a
detective
this
hovey
of
whom
sara
had
spoken
so
vilely
and
the
woman
did
not
mean
them
to
reach
the
pines
that
night
by
this
time
she
probably
had
some
knowledge
of
the
secret
of
the
bookcase
and
she
must
feel
that
she
had
successfully
frightened
away
my
desire
to
take
out
a
book
at
night
she
would
rob
the
bookcase
some
time
within
the
next
hours
before
any
one
found
the
smothered
bodies
of
paul
dabney
and
his
companion
and
with
her
treasure
she
would
be
off
sara
and
henry
would
give
notice
i
stood
there
as
though
movement
were
impossible
and
yet
i
knew
that
everything
depended
upon
haste
i
began
to
reckon
out
the
time
the
train
got
in
to
pine
cone
at
and
it
would
probably
be
late
it
was
always
late
it
would
take
two
men
walking
at
a
brisk
pace
at
least
an
hour
to
reach
the
swamp
it
was
now
just
five
i
had
thirty
minutes
therefore
in
which
to
save
the
secret
of
the
bookcase
and
to
rescue
the
man
i
loved
it
would
take
me
at
least
twenty
minutes
to
get
to
the
bridge
once
below
the
top
of
the
hill
i
could
run
as
fast
as
i
liked
every
second
was
valuable
now
i
went
into
the
bookroom
and
shut
the
door
kneeling
on
the
floor
i
tumbled
out
the
books
as
i
had
seen
the
baron
doubtless
sara
nobleman
do
then
i
removed
the
middle
shelf
and
began
tapping
softly
with
my
fingers
there
was
the
hollow
spot
and
there
just
back
of
the
shelf
i
had
removed
was
a
tiny
metal
projection
i
pushed
it
down
dropped
a
little
sliding
panel
and
i
thrust
my
hand
into
the
shallow
opening
i
was
cold
and
shuddering
with
haste
and
fear
and
excitement
my
fingers
touched
a
paper
and
i
drew
it
out
i
did
not
even
glance
at
it
i
hid
it
in
my
dress
closed
the
panel
restored
the
shelf
and
returned
the
books
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
i
could
then
i
went
out
into
the
hall
the
clock
had
ticked
away
fifteen
of
my
precious
minutes
if
the
train
was
late
i
still
had
time
i
went
out
of
the
front
door
and
began
with
as
good
an
air
of
careless
sauntering
as
i
could
force
my
body
to
assume
to
stroll
down
the
winding
driveway
i
longed
to
take
a
short
cut
but
i
did
not
dare
i
was
sure
that
my
double
was
on
the
watch
she
would
not
leave
that
driveway
unguarded
on
such
an
afternoon
i
felt
that
my
life
was
not
a
thing
to
wager
on
at
that
moment
i
doubted
if
i
should
be
allowed
to
reach
the
bridge
alive
the
utter
importance
of
my
doing
so
gave
me
the
courage
to
use
some
strategy
i
actually
forced
myself
to
return
still
sauntering
to
the
house
and
i
got
a
parasol
then
i
walked
around
to
the
garden
here
i
strolled
about
for
a
few
moments
and
then
slipped
away
plunged
through
a
dense
mass
of
bushes
at
the
back
followed
the
rough
course
of
a
tiny
stream
and
climbing
a
stone
wall
came
out
on
the
road
below
the
hill
and
several
feet
outside
of
the
pines
gateway
my
return
for
a
parasol
and
the
changed
direction
of
my
walk
would
be
certain
to
divert
suspicion
of
my
going
towards
the
bridge
nevertheless
i
felt
like
a
mouse
who
allows
itself
a
little
hope
when
the
watchful
cat
her
tail
twitching
her
terrible
eyes
half
shut
allows
it
to
creep
a
perilous
little
distance
from
her
claws
as
soon
as
i
was
well
out
of
sight
of
the
house
i
chose
a
short
cut
at
random
shut
my
parasol
and
ran
as
i
had
never
run
before
chapter
x
the
swamp
have
always
loved
pine
trees
since
that
desperate
afternoon
for
the
very
practical
reason
that
the
needles
prevent
the
growth
of
underbrush
my
skirts
were
left
free
and
my
feet
had
their
full
opportunity
for
speed
and
i
needed
every
ounce
of
strength
and
breath
before
i
came
to
the
top
of
the
last
steep
slope
that
plunged
down
to
the
stream
i
heard
a
hoarse
choking
cry
that
terrible
cry
for
help
help
help
it
was
a
man
voice
but
so
thick
and
weak
and
hollow
that
i
could
not
recognize
it
for
paul
dabney
i
did
not
dare
to
answer
it
such
was
my
dread
of
being
stopped
by
some
murderess
lurking
in
the
gnarled
and
stunted
trees
but
i
fairly
hurled
myself
down
the
path
there
was
the
bridge
i
saw
that
a
great
gap
yawned
in
the
middle
of
it
i
hurried
to
the
edge
down
below
me
in
the
gray
shadows
floated
a
desperate
white
face
paul
dabney
straining
eyes
under
his
hair
looked
up
at
me
and
the
faint
hope
in
them
went
out
you
again
he
gasped
painfully
you
come
back
to
see
the
end
he
smiled
a
twisted
ironical
smile
if
i
could
get
my
hand
out
of
this
infernal
grave
i
let
you
wrap
some
of
that
hair
of
yours
around
my
fingers
that
your
is
it
did
you
come
back
for
that
he
sank
an
inch
lower
his
chin
had
gone
under
he
lifted
it
out
bearded
with
filthy
mud
and
leaned
back
as
though
against
a
pillow
closing
his
eyes
he
had
given
up
hope
all
this
of
course
took
but
a
moment
of
time
i
had
been
looking
about
searching
the
place
for
help
near
the
edge
of
the
horrible
sluggish
stream
lay
a
board
left
there
by
henry
after
his
devilish
work
or
else
fallen
when
paul
dabney
had
broken
through
it
lay
on
the
farther
bank
i
stood
up
measured
the
distance
of
the
break
in
the
bridge
and
going
back
a
few
paces
ran
and
jumped
across
it
was
a
good
jump
i
hardly
looked
to
see
however
but
hurried
down
the
opposite
bank
and
shoved
out
the
board
towards
paul
dabney
only
his
face
now
glimmered
like
a
on
the
surface
of
the
mud
paul
i
cried
desperately
urgently
commandingly
pull
out
your
arm
i
have
come
to
save
his
eyes
opened
he
stared
at
me
then
life
seemed
to
come
back
to
his
face
he
made
a
frantic
choking
gasping
struggle
once
he
went
altogether
down
then
with
a
sucking
sound
his
arm
came
up
the
fingers
closed
on
my
board
i
caught
his
poor
cold
slimy
hand
i
pulled
with
all
my
strength
his
grip
was
like
a
convulsion
inch
by
inch
i
dragged
him
towards
the
bank
the
stream
surrendered
its
victim
with
a
sort
of
sticky
sob
and
he
lay
there
on
the
ground
beside
me
lifeless
as
a
log
hardly
to
be
recognized
as
a
human
being
so
daubed
and
drenched
was
he
with
the
black
ooze
that
had
so
nearly
been
his
death
my
attempts
to
restore
him
were
soon
successful
for
it
was
exhaustion
not
suffocation
that
had
made
him
faint
he
had
taken
very
little
of
the
mud
into
his
mouth
but
struggling
there
in
the
bottomless
horrible
slough
for
nearly
half
an
hour
had
taxed
his
strength
to
the
last
gasp
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
at
me
with
an
expression
of
grave
astonishment
i
knew
that
he
had
not
expected
me
to
be
such
a
serious
criminal
as
to
make
this
deliberate
attempt
on
his
life
and
yet
i
was
sure
as
his
large
gray
eyes
searched
me
that
he
was
deliberating
the
possibility
he
sat
up
presently
and
taking
my
handkerchief
he
wiped
off
his
face
and
hair
and
hands
the
rest
is
hopeless
he
said
the
other
man
i
asked
him
shudderingly
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
smooth
and
oily
water
he
looked
at
me
with
a
puzzled
face
the
other
man
there
was
not
any
other
man
then
stilt
looking
at
me
a
faint
unwilling
flush
stole
up
his
cheek
miss
gale
he
said
you
are
without
doubt
my
guardian
angel
and
yet
strangely
enough
i
had
a
dreadful
vision
of
what
you
might
be
as
another
kind
of
angel
when
i
was
going
down
he
shivered
all
over
and
glanced
at
the
stream
whose
surface
was
now
as
smooth
as
it
would
have
been
had
he
sunk
beneath
it
when
i
was
going
down
and
at
the
last
of
my
strength
i
was
delirious
i
suppose
but
i
had
a
sort
of
vision
i
thought
you
stood
there
on
the
bank
above
me
and
looked
down
with
your
narrow
face
between
its
two
wings
of
red
hair
and
mocked
me
just
as
i
was
settling
down
to
death
you
disappeared
and
just
a
few
moments
later
there
you
were
again
this
time
with
the
aura
of
a
saint
miss
gale
and
here
he
looked
at
me
with
entire
seriousness
dropping
his
tone
of
mockery
do
you
believe
in
dual
personalities
really
dabney
i
said
i
do
think
it
a
very
good
time
to
take
up
the
he
looked
away
from
me
and
spoke
low
with
an
air
of
confusion
you
called
me
when
you
shoved
out
that
blessed
board
which
has
gone
down
in
my
place
i
paid
no
attention
to
this
remark
but
stood
up
silently
he
too
rose
and
we
laid
a
log
across
the
deadly
opening
of
the
bridge
and
balanced
carefully
back
to
safety
i
could
not
think
of
my
leap
of
a
few
minutes
before
without
a
feeling
of
deathly
sickness
you
risked
your
life
murmured
paul
dabney
you
risked
your
life
to
save
me
he
stopped
me
as
we
climbed
up
the
hill
it
was
very
dark
there
amongst
the
trees
he
took
me
by
the
wrists
and
janice
gale
he
said
desperately
speaking
through
his
teeth
look
up
at
me
for
the
love
of
i
did
look
up
and
he
plunged
his
eyes
into
mine
as
though
he
were
diving
for
a
soul
i
put
up
no
barriers
between
my
heart
and
his
searching
eyes
it
was
so
dusky
there
that
he
could
not
read
any
of
my
secrets
i
let
him
search
till
at
last
he
sighed
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
and
let
my
hands
fall
passing
his
own
across
his
forehead
with
a
pitiful
air
of
confusion
and
defeat
belle
dame
sans
merci
has
thee
in
thrall
he
murmured
and
we
went
up
into
the
glimmering
twilight
of
the
open
spaces
where
the
swallows
were
still
wheeling
high
in
search
of
the
falling
sun
when
we
reached
the
house
i
asked
paul
dabney
timidly
if
he
did
not
think
it
best
to
change
and
not
to
alarm
brane
by
any
sight
of
his
condition
he
agreed
with
a
wry
sort
of
smile
and
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
i
saw
that
he
held
tight
to
the
railing
and
that
his
feet
dragged
he
was
very
near
indeed
to
collapse
the
walk
up
the
hill
had
been
almost
too
much
for
him
nevertheless
he
appeared
at
as
trim
and
neat
as
possible
with
the
air
of
demure
boyishness
which
was
so
disarming
completely
restored
not
only
was
he
neat
and
trim
in
person
but
he
was
mentally
alert
and
gay
he
ate
hardly
anything
to
be
sure
drank
not
at
all
and
sat
leaning
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
his
hand
in
his
pocket
as
he
laughed
and
talked
his
eyes
held
beneath
bright
innocent
surfaces
rather
a
harried
hunted
look
but
he
was
very
entertaining
so
much
so
that
his
pallor
the
little
choking
cough
that
bothered
him
and
my
own
condition
of
limp
reaction
to
the
desperate
excitement
of
the
afternoon
passed
entirely
unnoticed
by
brane
her
better
spirits
of
the
morning
had
returned
in
force
she
was
very
glad
to
see
paul
dabney
so
glad
that
i
suffered
a
twinge
of
heart
oh
she
laughed
but
it
good
to
have
a
man
in
the
house
shakespeare
is
right
you
know
when
he
says
woman
naturally
born
to
fears
i
do
think
he
was
right
at
all
paul
dabney
took
her
up
i
believe
that
the
man
is
naturally
the
more
fearful
animal
shakespeare
ought
to
have
said
woman
naturally
feigning
fear
i
with
the
modern
poet
female
of
the
species
is
more
deadly
than
the
male
take
the
lady
spider
for
what
does
the
lady
spider
do
asked
brane
she
devours
her
lover
while
she
is
still
in
his
how
horrible
horrible
but
the
creature
is
a
very
faithful
and
devoted
mother
i
think
there
are
many
women
here
his
hunted
and
haggard
look
rested
upon
me
who
would
be
glad
to
rid
themselves
of
a
lover
when
his
particular
usefulness
is
all
women
kill
the
thing
they
love
i
smiled
and
i
had
a
dreadful
feeling
that
my
smile
was
like
the
cruel
and
smile
of
the
woman
who
had
planned
paul
dabney
death
that
was
one
of
the
most
terrifying
consequences
of
the
nervous
shock
i
had
suffered
that
i
had
quite
often
now
this
obsession
as
though
the
vixen
were
using
me
obsessing
my
body
with
her
blackened
soul
as
though
gradually
i
were
becoming
her
instrument
the
smile
left
my
shaken
lips
and
i
saw
a
sort
of
reflection
of
it
draw
dabney
mouth
stiffly
across
his
teeth
his
pallor
deepened
he
looked
away
and
began
to
crumble
his
bread
with
restless
fingers
henry
passed
through
and
we
followed
him
into
the
where
coffee
was
always
served
when
paul
dabney
had
first
come
into
the
i
had
glanced
shrewdly
at
henry
the
jaw
behind
the
whiskers
had
dropped
the
eyes
had
blinked
then
discretion
was
perfectly
restored
but
i
felt
a
threatening
sort
of
gloom
emanate
from
the
man
towards
me
and
i
realized
that
my
position
was
doubly
dangerous
there
was
a
spirit
of
mutiny
in
my
supposed
accomplices
i
trusted
my
double
however
to
control
the
pair
their
fear
of
her
was
doubtless
greater
than
their
dread
of
detection
and
henry
probably
was
relieved
of
some
portion
of
his
fears
by
the
of
the
hovey
whom
sara
had
so
befouled
with
epithets
and
whom
she
evidently
so
greatly
feared
brane
excused
herself
early
and
i
too
rose
shortly
after
she
had
left
the
room
i
moved
slowly
towards
the
door
paul
dabney
stood
by
the
high
mantel
one
hand
in
his
pocket
the
other
resting
on
the
shelf
his
head
a
little
bent
looking
somberly
at
me
from
under
his
handsome
brows
he
looked
very
slim
and
young
the
thought
of
his
loneliness
of
his
danger
so
much
greater
than
he
suspected
smote
my
heart
i
wanted
to
go
back
and
tell
him
everything
even
my
love
i
was
hesitating
ready
to
turn
when
he
spoke
the
voice
sharp
and
stinging
as
a
lash
fell
with
a
bite
across
my
heart
he
said
my
hand
flew
to
my
breast
because
of
the
pain
he
caused
me
he
watched
me
narrowly
his
pale
face
was
rigid
with
the
guard
he
kept
upon
some
violent
feeling
my
hurt
turned
to
anger
you
suspect
me
of
sinister
things
paul
dabney
i
said
hotly
you
think
that
i
prowl
about
brane
house
while
she
sleeps
in
search
of
something
valuable
i
laughed
softly
perhaps
you
are
right
i
give
you
leave
to
pursue
your
investigations
though
i
say
i
consider
you
a
very
ingenious
he
started
and
the
color
came
in
a
wave
across
his
face
for
some
reason
the
slight
upon
his
amateur
detecting
seemed
to
sting
i
was
glad
i
would
have
liked
to
strike
him
to
cause
him
physical
pain
i
came
in
a
sort
of
rush
straight
over
to
him
and
he
drew
warily
back
till
he
stood
against
the
wall
his
eyes
narrowed
upon
me
his
head
bent
as
i
have
seen
the
eyes
and
heads
of
men
about
to
strike
listen
to
me
i
said
i
give
you
fair
warning
this
afternoon
i
saved
your
life
at
the
risk
of
my
own
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
that
again
i
advise
here
i
threw
all
the
contempt
possible
into
my
voice
i
advise
you
to
keep
out
of
this
to
stay
in
your
room
and
lock
your
door
at
night
do
smile
it
is
a
very
serious
warning
and
without
at
this
he
put
his
hand
to
his
eyes
and
i
left
him
standing
with
this
gesture
of
ashamed
defeat
it
was
a
night
of
full
and
splendid
moon
my
room
was
as
white
as
the
calyx
of
a
lily
so
white
that
its
very
radiance
made
sleep
impossible
besides
i
was
excited
by
my
battle
with
paul
dabney
and
by
the
thought
of
that
paper
in
my
dress
god
willing
now
the
struggle
would
soon
be
over
if
i
lived
through
the
next
hours
i
would
find
the
treasure
capture
the
thieves
confront
paul
dabney
with
my
innocence
and
my
achievement
and
leave
the
pines
forever
my
ordeal
was
not
so
nearly
over
as
i
hoped
there
were
further
tangles
in
the
female
spider
web
it
makes
me
laugh
now
and
blush
to
think
how
all
the
while
the
creature
made
her
use
of
me
how
the
cat
let
the
little
mouse
run
hither
and
thither
in
its
futile
activity
no
not
altogether
futile
i
did
play
an
extraordinary
rôle
i
did
that
very
afternoon
save
paul
dabney
life
i
did
bewilder
the
queen
spider
and
disturb
and
tear
her
web
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
was
she
who
was
mistress
of
the
pines
that
night
i
did
not
light
my
gas
so
splendid
was
the
moon
but
crouching
near
my
open
window
on
the
floor
i
took
out
the
paper
and
spread
it
open
on
my
knee
it
was
covered
with
close
lines
in
the
russian
script
the
writing
was
so
fine
and
delicate
that
to
read
it
i
should
need
a
stronger
light
i
rose
drew
my
shade
and
lit
the
gas
again
i
spread
out
the
paper
then
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
dismay
it
was
the
russian
script
perfectly
legible
to
me
but
alas
the
language
was
not
that
of
modern
russian
speech
it
was
the
old
slavonic
language
of
the
church
the
paper
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
though
it
were
still
hidden
in
the
bookcase
chapter
xi
the
spider
vain
i
tortured
my
wits
here
and
there
a
word
was
comprehensible
i
made
out
the
number
and
fairly
ground
my
teeth
here
was
the
key
to
the
secret
here
was
my
chart
and
i
could
not
decipher
it
i
folded
up
the
paper
with
great
care
ripped
open
a
seam
of
my
mattress
and
folded
the
mystery
in
by
night
i
would
keep
it
there
by
day
i
would
carry
it
about
on
my
body
somehow
i
would
think
out
a
way
to
decipher
it
i
would
go
to
new
york
and
interview
a
priest
of
the
greek
church
if
necessary
i
would
bribe
him
to
secrecy
my
brain
was
full
of
plans
more
or
less
foolish
and
impossible
at
any
rate
i
reasoned
that
the
woman
not
finding
any
paper
in
the
bookcase
would
do
one
of
two
things
either
she
would
suspect
a
previous
theft
and
disposal
of
the
treasure
and
give
up
her
perilous
mission
or
she
would
suspect
me
whom
she
had
found
once
at
night
before
the
in
this
case
i
was
of
course
both
in
greater
danger
and
also
providentially
protected
at
least
she
would
not
kill
me
till
she
had
got
that
paper
out
of
my
possession
my
problem
was
first
to
find
the
meaning
of
my
valuable
chart
then
to
put
it
in
her
way
and
while
she
endeavored
to
get
a
translation
i
could
not
believe
her
to
possess
a
knowledge
of
ecclesiastical
russian
it
was
my
part
to
rifle
the
hoard
and
to
set
the
police
on
her
track
when
i
had
the
meaning
of
the
paper
i
would
send
word
to
the
police
at
pine
cone
till
then
i
would
play
the
game
alone
so
did
my
vanity
and
wounded
feelings
lead
me
on
and
so
very
nearly
to
my
own
destruction
after
i
had
finished
sewing
up
my
i
put
out
my
light
and
went
to
stand
near
my
window
unconsciously
affected
by
my
fears
i
kept
close
to
the
long
dark
curtain
and
stood
still
looking
down
at
the
silvered
garden
paths
the
lines
of
the
box
the
towering
masses
of
the
trees
waving
their
spray
of
shadow
tracery
across
the
turf
i
stood
there
a
long
time
brooding
over
my
plans
it
must
have
been
an
hour
before
i
saw
a
figure
come
out
into
the
garden
it
was
paul
dabney
he
was
walking
quietly
to
and
fro
smoking
and
whistling
softly
i
could
hear
the
gravel
crunch
beneath
his
feet
all
at
once
he
stopped
short
and
threw
up
his
head
as
though
at
a
signal
he
tossed
away
his
cigarette
he
stared
at
the
arbor
the
one
where
poor
mary
used
to
watch
her
little
charge
at
play
and
then
as
though
he
were
drawn
against
his
will
he
went
slowly
towards
it
hesitated
bent
his
head
a
little
and
stepped
in
i
heard
the
low
murmur
of
his
voice
i
thought
that
brane
was
in
the
arbor
and
my
heart
grew
sick
with
jealousy
i
was
about
to
drag
myself
away
from
the
window
when
another
figure
came
out
of
the
arbor
and
stood
for
an
instant
in
the
bright
moonlight
looking
straight
up
to
my
window
i
grew
cold
i
stood
there
holding
my
breath
i
heard
a
little
low
musical
wicked
laugh
the
creature
my
own
cloak
drooping
from
her
shoulders
turned
and
went
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
vine
my
god
what
was
she
about
to
do
to
paul
the
blind
fool
to
sit
there
with
that
horrible
thing
and
to
fancy
that
he
sat
with
me
having
failed
in
her
attempt
to
drown
him
she
was
now
beguiling
him
out
of
the
house
for
a
few
hours
in
order
to
give
one
of
her
accomplices
a
chance
to
search
the
bookcase
i
had
no
scruples
about
playing
eavesdropper
i
took
off
my
shoes
and
hurried
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
i
stole
to
a
shuttered
window
in
the
and
inch
by
inch
with
infinite
caution
i
raised
the
sash
i
was
so
near
to
the
arbor
that
a
hand
stretched
out
at
the
full
length
of
its
arm
could
touch
the
honeysuckle
vines
i
stood
there
and
strained
my
ears
the
woman
was
speaking
so
low
that
it
was
but
a
gentle
thread
of
voice
it
was
extraordinarily
young
and
sweet
the
tone
sweeter
than
my
voice
though
astonishingly
like
it
why
did
i
save
you
paul
dabney
she
was
murmuring
ca
you
guess
ca
you
guess
there
came
the
sound
of
a
soft
dreadful
kiss
i
burned
with
shame
from
head
to
foot
you
devil
you
said
paul
dabney
in
low
hot
speech
you
can
kiss
i
could
bear
no
more
she
must
be
in
his
arms
what
was
the
reason
for
this
deviltry
this
profanation
of
my
innocence
and
youth
this
desecration
of
my
name
i
hated
and
loathed
paul
dabney
for
his
hot
voice
for
his
kiss
he
thought
that
he
held
there
in
his
arms
that
he
insulted
tamely
submissive
with
his
words
you
devil
you
i
fled
to
my
room
i
threw
myself
upon
my
bed
i
sobbed
and
raved
in
a
crazed
smothered
fashion
to
my
pillow
i
struck
the
bed
with
my
hands
i
do
not
know
how
long
that
dreadful
meeting
lasted
i
realized
with
entire
disregard
that
it
lasted
sara
was
searching
the
bookcase
to
this
day
i
can
think
of
it
only
with
a
sickness
of
loathing
once
i
fancied
that
i
heard
paul
dabney
step
under
my
window
but
i
hid
my
head
covered
my
ears
i
lay
in
a
still
fever
of
rage
and
horror
all
that
night
the
insult
so
strange
and
unimaginable
a
one
to
my
own
unhappy
love
was
more
than
i
could
bear
i
wanted
to
kill
and
kill
and
kill
these
two
and
last
myself
chapter
xii
not
meant
to
ask
brane
the
next
morning
to
excuse
me
from
my
work
of
cataloguing
the
books
of
her
husband
library
i
had
no
courage
to
face
paul
dabney
unluckily
brane
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
she
had
a
severe
headache
i
did
not
like
to
disturb
her
with
my
request
nor
did
i
like
to
give
up
my
duty
without
permission
for
the
catalogue
was
nearly
completed
and
brane
was
very
impatient
about
it
so
i
dragged
myself
into
the
bookroom
at
the
usual
time
paul
dabney
was
not
yet
there
he
breakfasted
late
going
out
first
for
a
long
tramp
and
a
swim
i
hoped
that
he
would
not
come
at
all
this
morning
i
went
languidly
to
work
i
did
not
feel
the
slightest
interest
to
know
whether
or
not
sara
lorrence
had
taken
advantage
of
the
decoying
of
paul
dabney
and
had
made
an
investigation
of
the
russian
i
felt
utterly
wretched
and
drained
of
life
and
of
the
desire
to
live
when
at
last
paul
dabney
footstep
came
along
the
hall
and
somewhat
hesitatingly
in
at
the
door
i
did
not
turn
my
head
he
stopped
at
sight
of
me
and
stood
still
i
could
feel
that
his
eyes
were
on
me
and
i
struggled
against
a
nervous
curiosity
to
see
the
expression
of
his
look
but
i
would
not
yield
i
kept
on
doggedly
taking
down
a
volume
dusting
it
clapping
its
leaves
together
putting
it
back
and
making
a
note
of
its
title
and
author
in
the
book
that
brane
had
given
me
for
the
purpose
my
face
burned
my
turned
to
ice
anger
disgust
shame
seemed
to
have
taken
the
place
of
the
blood
along
my
veins
at
last
you
are
not
as
affable
a
companion
by
day
as
you
are
by
night
drawled
the
young
man
and
came
strolling
a
step
nearer
to
me
across
the
floor
i
know
you
made
me
promise
he
went
on
not
to
speak
of
any
moonlight
madness
by
the
common
light
of
day
but
strangely
enough
your
spell
does
hold
i
feel
quite
able
to
break
my
word
to
you
he
paused
i
wondered
if
he
could
feel
the
tumult
of
my
helpless
rage
i
have
been
very
much
afraid
of
you
he
said
but
that
is
changed
no
man
can
be
afraid
of
the
serpent
he
has
fondled
even
when
he
knows
that
its
fang
is
as
poisonous
as
sin
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
at
the
book
slid
to
the
floor
my
head
seemed
to
bend
of
its
own
weight
to
meet
my
hands
a
great
strangling
burst
of
laughter
tore
my
throat
pealed
from
my
lips
filled
the
room
i
laughed
like
a
maniac
i
rocked
with
laughter
then
staggering
to
my
feet
i
went
over
to
the
window
bench
and
sat
there
sobbing
and
crying
as
though
my
heart
must
break
paul
dabney
shut
the
door
swore
paced
the
room
at
last
came
over
to
me
and
bade
me
roughly
to
stop
my
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
he
said
coldly
you
wo
make
one
of
me
i
assure
at
that
i
looked
up
at
him
through
a
veil
of
tears
showing
him
a
face
that
must
have
been
as
simple
as
an
angry
child
look
at
me
paul
dabney
i
gasped
look
hard
as
hard
as
you
looked
yesterday
afternoon
down
there
near
the
swamp
after
i
had
saved
your
life
and
when
you
have
looked
tell
me
what
you
know
about
me
me
me
janice
he
caught
me
by
the
hands
and
looked
my
tears
falling
left
my
vision
clear
and
his
face
showed
so
haunted
and
haggard
and
spent
so
wronged
that
with
a
welcome
rush
tenderness
and
pity
and
understanding
came
back
for
a
moment
to
my
heart
i
realized
for
just
that
moment
what
he
must
be
suffering
from
this
dreadful
tangle
in
which
he
had
been
caught
how
could
he
know
me
for
what
i
really
was
when
that
demon
came
to
him
with
my
face
and
voice
and
hands
and
eyes
and
yet
the
moment
passed
and
left
me
hard
again
i
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
known
some
glimmer
of
the
truth
should
have
come
to
him
in
fact
after
a
moment
he
dropped
my
hands
and
put
his
own
over
his
eyes
he
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
there
staring
out
unseeing
i
was
sure
his
shoulders
sagged
his
whole
slight
energetic
body
drooped
i
saw
his
fist
shut
and
open
at
his
side
after
a
long
time
he
turned
and
came
slowly
back
to
stand
before
me
janice
gale
he
said
in
a
changed
and
much
more
gentle
voice
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
the
accursed
mystery
means
do
you
remember
last
night
do
you
remember
do
your
lips
remember
our
kisses
i
ca
look
at
the
sweetness
and
the
sorrow
of
them
and
believe
it
is
this
your
real
self
or
is
that
are
you
possessed
by
a
or
is
this
a
mask
of
youth
and
innocence
i
do
believe
you
must
be
a
victim
of
that
strange
psychic
affliction
of
a
divided
personality
janice
tell
me
do
you
know
what
you
do
he
dropped
his
voice
as
a
man
who
speaks
of
ghostly
and
unhallowed
things
after
you
have
gone
to
sleep
i
wanted
to
tell
him
but
i
wanted
more
strongly
to
triumph
over
him
the
rush
of
tenderness
had
passed
i
could
not
forget
the
insult
of
his
tone
to
me
the
jeering
biting
contempt
of
his
speeches
i
longed
passionately
to
bring
him
down
to
my
feet
to
humble
him
and
then
to
raise
him
up
love
is
a
cruel
sort
of
madness
a
monster
perfectionist
my
love
for
him
could
not
forgive
his
blindness
he
ought
to
have
known
he
ought
to
have
seen
my
soul
too
clearly
to
be
so
easy
a
dupe
and
his
love
for
me
ought
to
have
driven
him
shuddering
from
those
other
lips
it
ought
to
have
been
his
shield
and
weapon
of
defense
instead
of
his
lure
i
have
nothing
to
confess
i
told
him
coldly
why
should
i
confess
to
you
you
have
come
to
this
house
to
persecute
and
to
insult
me
how
do
you
dare
i
shook
with
a
resurgent
rage
and
disgust
to
speak
to
me
of
when
are
you
going
away
from
this
house
or
must
i
go
and
begin
to
struggle
again
to
hunt
for
work
if
i
had
a
brother
or
a
father
or
any
protector
strong
enough
to
deal
with
the
sort
of
man
you
are
i
should
have
you
for
your
conduct
to
me
oh
i
could
strike
you
myself
i
hate
and
loathe
you
i
sobbed
having
worked
myself
up
almost
to
the
frenzy
of
the
past
night
i
want
to
punish
you
you
have
hurt
and
shamed
me
i
fought
for
thank
god
it
will
soon
be
i
stood
up
and
tried
to
pass
him
he
held
out
his
arms
to
bar
me
and
looking
down
at
me
his
face
flushed
and
quivering
he
said
between
his
teeth
when
it
is
over
as
you
must
know
my
dear
sphinx
one
of
us
two
will
be
dead
i
am
not
the
first
man
i
fancy
that
you
have
driven
to
madness
or
worse
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
strength
to
make
the
world
safe
from
you
before
i
go
that
what
i
live
for
now
though
made
my
life
rather
more
of
a
hell
than
even
i
ever
thought
life
could
be
our
eyes
met
and
the
looks
crossed
like
swords
let
me
go
out
your
faith
is
not
much
greater
than
your
skill
master
i
think
the
outcome
will
astonish
you
let
me
go
out
i
he
moved
away
grim
and
pale
his
jaws
set
and
i
went
out
on
my
way
to
my
room
mary
met
me
in
the
hall
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
began
then
broke
off
oh
miss
gale
dear
how
bad
you
look
she
said
i
was
so
glad
to
see
her
dear
honest
trusting
truthful
face
that
i
put
my
head
down
on
her
shoulder
and
cried
like
a
baby
in
her
arms
she
made
me
go
to
my
room
and
lie
down
she
bathed
my
face
and
laid
a
cold
wet
cloth
across
my
temples
poor
blessed
girl
she
said
in
her
nursey
way
she
all
wore
out
poor
soul
poor
pretty
a
dozen
such
absurd
and
comforting
ejaculations
she
made
use
of
how
comforting
my
poor
motherless
youth
had
never
till
then
let
me
know
when
i
was
quieter
she
brought
her
sewing
and
sat
beside
my
bed
rocking
and
humming
she
asked
no
questions
just
told
me
when
i
tried
to
apologize
to
hush
now
and
try
to
get
a
little
and
actually
i
did
go
to
sleep
i
woke
up
as
though
on
the
crest
of
a
resurgent
wave
of
life
i
sat
on
my
bed
and
smiled
at
mary
then
gathering
my
knees
in
my
hands
i
said
now
i
all
right
again
nursey
tell
me
what
you
wanted
to
ask
me
when
you
met
me
in
the
it
was
extraordinary
how
calm
and
clear
i
felt
how
sufficient
to
myself
and
able
to
meet
what
was
coming
and
bring
it
to
a
triumphant
end
with
what
good
and
healing
spirits
do
we
sometimes
walk
when
we
are
asleep
do
hesitate
dear
mary
i
done
with
my
nonsense
now
i
perfectly
able
to
face
any
domestic
crisis
from
ghosts
to
broken
well
said
mary
beginning
to
rock
in
an
indignant
staccato
fashion
there
are
as
many
ways
of
rocking
as
there
are
moods
in
the
one
who
rocks
it
that
there
sara
never
in
all
my
days
of
service
in
the
old
country
and
here
have
i
met
with
the
like
of
her
in
what
way
i
mean
what
she
like
why
she
like
a
whited
sepulcher
this
time
she
pronounced
it
that
what
she
like
she
as
smooth
and
as
a
pet
dove
that
she
is
mary
similes
were
quite
extraordinary
she
fair
coos
and
so
full
of
her
and
you
pleases
she
a
good
worker
too
steady
and
quiet
too
quiet
to
be
nacheral
and
indeed
nacheral
it
ai
not
for
her
a
murderess
at
heart
miss
that
what
she
i
was
startled
i
gripped
my
knees
more
tightly
yes
miss
up
to
this
mornin
though
i
ca
say
i
had
a
likin
for
her
for
that
would
be
the
truth
and
i
always
hold
to
my
sayin
of
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
but
this
mornin
i
run
into
her
quite
by
accident
in
the
nursery
and
what
she
should
be
doin
in
my
blessed
lamb
room
i
ca
say
and
and
and
her
face
like
a
fury
o
lor
miss
i
ca
give
you
no
notion
of
what
she
was
like
nor
the
langwidge
filth
it
was
though
i
should
use
the
word
and
miss
i
made
sure
it
was
you
she
was
in
a
rage
with
and
there
like
the
foul
fiend
she
did
know
i
was
seein
her
but
when
she
did
the
shameless
hussy
went
on
as
bad
as
before
never
did
i
see
nor
hear
the
like
of
it
i
tried
to
shame
her
but
it
was
like
tryin
to
shame
a
witch
caldron
with
cats
tongues
and
vipers
and
dead
men
hands
awful
it
was
to
make
your
blood
run
cold
miss
gale
you
had
ought
to
keep
the
creature
in
the
house
it
ai
could
you
find
out
why
she
was
so
angry
indeed
there
was
so
much
cursin
and
sputterin
that
i
could
make
out
much
sense
to
her
but
it
was
somethin
about
bein
made
a
mock
of
and
gettin
nothin
for
your
pains
she
been
glum
all
mornin
miss
i
seen
that
and
i
left
her
alone
her
and
henry
had
been
words
at
breakfast
time
but
was
fair
awful
seems
like
as
if
she
had
just
kept
the
whole
rumpus
in
her
wickit
breast
till
it
boiled
over
and
she
run
into
the
nursery
and
let
it
go
off
like
some
poison
bottle
with
the
cork
blown
away
if
you
know
what
i
mean
miss
it
ai
safe
to
keep
her
in
the
house
i
laughed
a
little
no
mary
i
do
believe
it
is
very
yes
miss
and
that
not
all
there
is
doin
i
do
like
in
this
house
and
i
have
come
to
you
before
but
it
seems
like
i
made
you
so
much
trouble
in
this
place
and
you
been
lookin
peaky
you
been
a
perfect
godsend
to
me
mary
i
cried
please
tell
me
anything
everything
never
hesitate
to
come
to
me
never
delay
an
well
there
two
or
three
things
that
has
been
vexin
me
little
things
in
themselves
but
not
now
that
what
i
say
you
can
stand
anything
so
long
as
it
in
the
old
country
now
as
i
told
you
i
worked
in
a
haunted
house
and
the
help
was
told
to
expect
a
ghost
and
it
come
every
night
its
chains
up
the
stairs
but
bless
me
did
we
mind
it
not
a
bit
was
all
and
seemly
if
you
know
what
i
mean
nothin
that
you
could
expect
and
prepare
your
mind
for
what
i
do
like
about
the
happenin
here
is
they
most
there
no
tellin
whatever
where
they
break
out
nor
this
typically
english
distinction
as
to
the
desirable
regularity
of
apparitions
amused
me
so
much
that
i
did
not
hurry
mary
in
her
story
she
got
back
to
it
presently
miss
gale
you
know
that
long
gray
cloak
of
yours
with
the
linin
yes
my
heart
did
beat
a
trifle
faster
and
the
little
hat
you
leave
with
the
cloak
down
in
the
front
hall
on
the
rack
behind
the
door
yes
well
miss
the
rocking
grew
impressive
portentous
climatic
somebody
has
been
usin
at
oh
mary
yes
miss
and
it
must
been
that
sara
like
as
not
she
sneaks
off
and
meets
some
feller
down
the
road
or
even
over
to
pine
cone
and
her
a
married
woman
pleased
she
be
to
fix
the
blame
of
her
bad
doin
on
you
what
would
brane
think
miss
if
she
seen
you
one
of
these
moonlight
nights
as
bright
as
day
away
from
her
house
at
some
unseemly
hour
she
call
it
yes
miss
it
makes
my
blood
boil
it
is
certainly
not
a
pleasant
idea
i
said
dryly
no
miss
to
put
it
mild
not
pleasant
not
a
bit
well
miss
i
found
your
cloak
this
hangin
in
its
place
and
the
hem
drenched
with
dew
you
can
see
for
yourself
if
you
go
down
in
the
hall
now
it
stands
to
reason
if
you
worn
it
yourself
the
hem
would
touched
the
grass
hardly
but
a
short
woman
like
sara
is
unless
i
had
sat
down
on
a
low
rustic
bench
i
put
in
well
was
you
out
last
night
no
mary
unless
i
been
walking
in
my
she
looked
a
little
startled
and
stared
at
me
with
round
anxious
eyes
to
which
tears
came
oh
miss
i
do
think
it
really
and
truly
i
she
had
not
seen
the
strand
of
hair
about
robbie
fingers
and
the
kind
soul
had
diligently
weeded
out
any
suspicions
even
of
my
unconscious
complicity
in
robbie
death
nor
do
i
mary
dear
in
fact
i
was
broad
awake
all
last
night
i
never
closed
my
eyes
perhaps
i
drank
too
much
coffee
after
dinner
or
perhaps
it
was
the
there
now
the
rocking
became
triumphant
that
proves
it
sara
it
what
else
mary
what
are
the
other
little
things
why
it
seems
foolish
to
mention
but
i
just
think
i
kinder
indeed
you
ought
i
had
to
go
down
to
the
kitchen
late
last
friday
night
brane
could
sleep
and
i
thought
i
give
her
a
glass
of
warm
milk
same
as
i
ust
to
give
my
poor
lamb
well
miss
i
found
the
kitchen
door
locked
the
one
at
the
foot
of
the
back
stairs
not
the
one
that
goes
outdoors
which
nacherly
would
be
fastened
at
night
the
key
was
on
my
side
of
the
door
so
it
stands
to
reaso
was
locked
on
the
kitchen
side
and
sara
and
henry
been
in
that
kitchen
though
it
was
dark
not
a
glimmer
under
the
door
or
through
the
keyhole
and
not
a
sound
or
else
they
gone
out
the
back
way
why
should
sara
lock
her
kitchen
door
and
go
round
the
other
way
do
it
seem
a
bit
odd
to
you
and
when
i
axed
her
the
next
mornin
she
kinder
snarled
like
and
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
that
the
kitchen
door
was
her
affair
and
that
if
i
valued
my
soul
i
best
keep
to
my
bed
nights
in
this
we
were
silent
for
a
moment
while
i
digested
this
sinister
injunction
and
the
rocker
registered
the
indignation
of
a
respectable
englishwoman
anything
else
mary
i
asked
at
last
mary
stopped
rocking
she
folded
her
hands
on
her
work
and
her
round
eyes
took
on
a
doubting
puzzled
look
yes
one
other
thing
and
maybe
it
means
naught
and
maybe
it
means
a
lot
deviltry
it
must
be
of
some
kind
i
says
or
else
mere
she
paused
and
i
saw
her
face
pucker
tearfully
you
know
how
i
did
love
that
pitiful
little
robbie
miss
yes
mary
well
times
when
i
feel
like
my
heart
would
bust
out
with
grievin
i
go
off
and
away
by
myself
somewhere
and
kinder
yes
you
dear
faithful
soul
and
i
like
to
choose
some
spot
that
me
of
my
well
was
only
this
mornin
that
i
woke
up
and
missed
him
out
of
common
so
sweet
he
was
when
he
waked
up
and
cheery
as
a
robin
so
was
early
early
mornin
the
sun
just
up
and
i
crep
out
quiet
and
went
out
to
the
garden
and
sat
down
in
the
arbor
where
i
ust
to
sit
and
watch
the
little
darlin
at
his
play
well
miss
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
sat
there
cryin
like
a
baby
and
was
a
while
before
i
seen
that
there
lay
a
paper
under
the
bench
like
as
if
it
might
have
fallen
there
from
a
body
pocket
i
picked
it
up
was
covered
with
heathenish
writin
here
i
kep
it
in
my
apron
to
show
you
she
took
the
paper
from
her
pocket
and
i
sprang
up
and
seized
it
eagerly
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
had
been
lost
by
my
double
as
she
sat
with
paul
last
night
it
was
a
letter
in
the
russian
script
i
read
it
rapidly
ever
dear
and
honored
madame
i
await
the
summons
of
your
necessity

message
received
here

name
and

town

the
county

me

bring
me
to
pine
cone
in
a
few
hours
by
i
hold
myself
at
your
commands
and
will
lend
you
the
service
of
my
knowledge
in
translating
the
slavonic
curiosity

have
described
to
me

movingly

your
promises

and
the
servant
of
that
eternal
eye
that
watches
the
good
and
evil
of
this
earthly
chapter
xiii
the
spider
bites
was
so
excited
by
the
importance
of
mary
accidental
discovery
that
i
folded
up
the
paper
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
and
was
turning
towards
the
desk
when
mary
in
an
aggrieved
voice
recalled
herself
to
my
attention
well
miss
maybe
it
ai
my
business
and
maybe
it
is
and
i
want
to
push
myself
forward
but
oh
mary
i
said
indeed
it
is
your
business
and
a
very
important
business
too
and
just
as
soon
as
i
think
it
safe
to
tell
you
i
will
every
word
of
it
only
i
have
to
ask
you
to
trust
me
just
a
little
bit
further
and
to
let
me
make
use
of
this
paper
you
do
imagine
how
terribly
important
it
is
to
me
i
could
see
that
mary
was
shocked
by
my
uncanny
knowledge
indeed
miss
gale
if
you
can
make
anything
out
of
that
heathen
writin
i
smiled
as
reassuringly
as
i
could
it
is
not
heathenish
it
is
russian
and
it
was
written
by
a
sort
of
clergy
oh
miss
and
under
the
rustic
bench
in
our
arbor
yes
mary
i
know
it
all
sounds
as
wild
as
a
dream
and
i
ca
explain
it
just
yet
but
you
will
trust
me
mary
a
little
longer
and
keep
the
secret
of
this
paper
to
yourself
do
mention
it
do
even
whisper
of
it
do
show
that
you
have
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
everything
depends
upon
mary
had
stood
up
and
now
smoothed
down
her
apron
and
drew
in
a
doubtful
whistling
breath
which
she
presently
expelled
in
sharp
little
teks
teks
teks
i
translated
all
this
readily
she
did
not
like
my
superior
and
secret
knowledge
she
did
not
like
my
air
of
cool
captaincy
she
did
not
like
my
reserve
nor
my
disposal
of
her
but
the
good
soul
could
not
help
but
be
loyalty
itself
she
made
no
more
protest
than
that
of
the
teks
then
said
in
a
rather
sad
but
perfectly
dependable
voice
very
good
i
came
over
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
mary
you
are
the
best
woman
in
the
world
and
the
best
friend
i
ever
this
brought
her
around
completely
her
natural
honest
kindly
smile
broke
out
upon
her
face
bless
you
miss
she
said
heartily
i
do
most
anything
for
you
you
can
trust
me
not
to
speak
of
the
i
know
i
can
mary
when
she
had
gone
i
did
go
over
to
my
desk
and
took
out
a
slip
of
paper
after
some
careful
thinking
i
printed
in
ink
a
few
lines
in
russian
script
at
eleven
of
next
wednesday
morning
i
will
meet
you
in
the
parlor
of
the
only
in
pine
cone
be
prepared
to
translate
the
slavonic
curiosity
and
be
assured
of
a
i
dared
not
risk
any
signature
but
for
fear
there
might
be
something
in
these
lines
that
would
rouse
the
suspicion
of
their
authenticity
i
racked
my
brain
for
some
signal
that
might
be
a
convincing
one
at
last
i
pulled
out
a
hair
from
my
head
placed
it
on
the
paper
as
though
it
had
fallen
there
and
folded
it
in
then
i
put
my
paper
into
a
blank
envelope
which
i
sealed
and
secreted
in
my
dress
this
done
i
tore
the
letter
mary
had
found
into
a
hundred
minute
pieces
and
burned
them
hiding
the
ashes
in
my
of
flowers
i
had
memorized
the
address
and
name
of
gast
at
lunch
i
asked
brane
who
had
sufficiently
recovered
from
her
headache
to
appear
whether
she
would
like
me
to
go
over
to
pine
cone
and
buy
her
the
shade
hat
for
which
she
had
been
longing
ever
since
mary
had
reported
the
arrival
of
some
philippine
millinery
in
the
principal
shop
i
said
that
i
felt
the
need
of
a
good
long
walk
henry
without
a
flicker
of
interest
in
my
request
went
on
with
perfect
and
discreet
performance
of
but
i
felt
that
he
was
mentally
pricking
up
his
ears
he
must
have
wondered
what
the
purpose
of
my
expedition
really
was
i
hoped
that
if
any
rumor
of
it
reached
the
ears
of
my
double
she
would
take
the
precaution
of
keeping
close
in
her
mysterious
during
my
absence
it
was
absurd
how
i
felt
responsible
for
the
life
of
every
member
of
the
household
paul
dabney
did
not
ask
to
accompany
me
on
my
walk
though
brane
evidently
expected
him
to
he
was
absent
and
silent
at
lunch
crumbled
his
bread
and
wore
his
air
of
demure
detachment
like
a
shield
he
was
as
white
as
the
table
napery
but
had
a
cool
expression
that
for
some
reason
annoyed
me
i
started
on
my
long
and
lonely
walk
about
half
an
hour
after
lunch
i
was
nervous
and
fearful
and
wished
that
i
too
had
a
pocket
such
as
paul
dabney
bulging
one
where
so
often
i
fancied
he
kept
his
right
hand
on
the
smooth
handle
of
an
automatic
i
thought
scornfully
of
his
timidity
my
own
danger
was
so
enormously
greater
than
his
and
his
own
was
so
enormously
greater
than
he
could
possibly
suspect
i
must
confess
however
that
it
taxed
my
nerve
severely
to
cross
the
bridge
over
the
quicksand
that
afternoon
it
had
been
mended
of
course
the
very
evening
of
paul
accident
but
i
tested
every
plank
before
i
gave
it
my
weight
and
i
clung
to
the
railing
with
both
clammy
hands
not
until
i
reached
the
other
bank
did
i
let
the
breath
out
of
my
lungs
on
the
dusty
shady
highroad
courage
returned
to
me
and
i
walked
ahead
at
a
good
pace
i
did
want
very
strongly
to
reach
that
bridge
again
before
dark
i
would
not
trust
my
letter
to
the
rural
delivery
box
near
the
pines
lane
i
was
determined
to
mail
it
at
the
and
to
be
sure
that
it
went
out
by
the
evening
mail
i
was
successful
addressed
the
blank
envelope
and
slipped
it
in
bought
hat
and
hurrying
home
found
myself
in
time
for
five
tea
i
had
met
with
no
misadventure
of
any
kind
not
even
a
shadow
had
fallen
on
my
path
but
i
was
as
tired
as
though
i
had
been
through
every
terror
that
had
tormented
my
imagination
i
went
to
bed
that
night
and
slept
well
the
four
days
that
followed
the
mailing
of
my
letter
were
as
still
as
the
proverbial
lull
before
the
storm
we
all
went
quietly
about
our
lives
whatever
mutiny
was
hidden
in
the
souls
of
henry
and
his
female
accomplice
smouldered
there
without
explosion
sara
indeed
was
sullen
and
obeyed
my
orders
with
an
air
of
resentment
paul
dabney
seemed
to
be
immersed
in
study
it
looked
to
me
sometimes
as
though
every
one
in
the
house
was
waiting
as
breathlessly
and
secretly
as
i
was
for
the
meeting
with
that
unknown
servant
of
the
eternal
eye
certainly
it
was
curious
that
on
the
very
wednesday
morning
brane
should
have
decided
to
send
gregory
the
old
horse
to
pine
cone
for
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
that
she
should
herself
have
suggested
my
going
with
george
for
a
little
outing
her
face
was
perfectly
innocent
but
i
could
not
refrain
from
asking
her
what
made
you
think
of
sending
me
brane
she
gave
me
a
knowing
teasing
little
look
somebody
takes
a
great
interest
in
your
health
proud
maisie
she
said
paul
dabney
i
was
not
a
little
startled
by
the
opportuneness
of
his
interest
it
was
to
say
the
least
a
trifle
odd
that
he
should
want
me
to
drive
to
pine
cone
on
the
very
morning
of
my
appointment
i
was
half
minded
to
refuse
to
drive
with
george
then
decided
that
this
refusal
would
only
serve
to
point
any
suspicion
that
paul
dabney
might
be
entertaining
of
me
so
i
agreed
meekly
to
the
arrangement
and
set
off
in
due
time
seated
in
the
by
george
substantial
side
he
was
undoubtedly
a
comfort
to
me
and
i
kept
him
chattering
all
the
way
he
had
lost
the
air
of
bravado
he
had
shown
on
our
first
drive
together
for
the
pines
had
been
to
all
appearances
a
place
of
supreme
tranquillity
since
robbie
death
his
talk
was
all
of
the
a
string
of
complaints
the
roads
needed
mending
the
fences
were
down
government
do
do
nothin
fer
this
yere
po
he
pointed
out
a
tall
ragged
dead
pine
near
a
turn
in
the
road
i
remember
and
groaned
jes
a
tech
to
send
that
tree
plum
oveh
yeah
on
the
top
of
this
complaint
was
one
of
a
hundred
and
stuck
in
my
mind
because
of
later
happenings
we
jogged
into
pine
cone
at
eleven
and
i
occupied
myself
variously
till
the
hour
of
the
appointment
when
with
a
sickish
feeling
of
nervous
suspense
i
forced
my
steps
towards
the
i
went
in
through
the
door
and
passed
the
fountain
and
the
counters
where
stale
candy
and
coarse
calicoes
beckoned
for
a
purchaser
and
i
went
on
between
green
rep
tasseled
portières
to
the
damp
dark
inner
room
where
the
tables
vacant
of
food
seemed
to
attract
by
some
mysterious
promise
a
swarm
of
dull
and
sluggish
flies
whose
mournful
buzzing
filled
the
stagnant
air
there
was
one
person
in
the
parlor
a
man
i
moved
doubtfully
towards
him
and
he
lifted
his
head
this
head
was
a
replica
of
the
figures
of
christ
a
long
oval
countenance
with
smooth
long
yellow
hair
parted
in
the
middle
of
the
brow
with
oblong
eyes
a
long
nose
a
mouth
drooping
exaggeratedly
at
the
corners
and
a
very
long
silky
yellow
beard
also
parted
in
the
middle
and
hanging
in
two
rippling
points
almost
to
his
waist
he
was
dressed
in
a
rusty
black
suit
the
very
long
sleeves
of
which
hung
down
quite
over
his
hands
at
sight
of
me
he
turned
pale
rose
the
dolorous
mouth
drooping
more
extremely
madame
he
said
in
the
lisping
clumsy
speech
of
those
whose
supply
of
teeth
falls
short
of
lingual
demands
is
as
prompt
as
the
justice
of
and
he
bowed
and
cringed
painfully
i
sat
down
opposite
to
him
and
gave
the
languid
youth
who
came
an
order
for
two
plates
of
i
was
horribly
embarrassed
and
confused
but
by
a
mighty
effort
i
maintained
an
air
of
the
priest
i
should
have
known
him
for
a
renegade
priest
anywhere
sat
meekly
with
his
hidden
hands
resting
on
the
table
before
him
and
his
great
smooth
lids
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
once
he
looked
up
for
an
instant
madame
preserves
her
youth
he
lisped
as
though
she
had
lived
upon
the
blood
of
and
he
ran
the
tip
of
his
tongue
over
his
lips
this
horrible
speech
was
no
doubt
exactly
suited
to
the
taste
of
my
counterpart
i
knew
that
i
was
expected
to
laugh
and
i
dragged
my
lips
across
my
teeth
in
imitation
of
the
ghastly
smile
it
passed
muster
he
fell
upon
his
when
it
was
brought
to
him
like
a
starved
creature
and
then
i
noticed
the
horrible
deformity
of
his
hands
he
hooked
a
twisted
stump
about
the
handle
of
his
spoon
nearly
all
the
fingers
were
gone
what
was
left
were
mere
torn
fragments
of
bone
and
tendon
his
hands
must
have
been
horribly
crushed
the
top
part
of
the
hands
crushed
off
entirely
it
made
me
sick
to
look
at
them
i
produced
my
chart
and
passed
it
over
to
him
he
paused
in
his
repast
wiped
off
his
lips
and
beard
took
out
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
from
one
of
his
ragged
pockets
and
translated
with
great
rapidity
scribbling
down
the
lines
with
a
stump
of
a
pencil
about
which
he
wrapped
his
crooked
index
stump
very
cleverly
he
grew
quite
hot
with
excitement
as
he
wrote
his
enormous
forehead
turned
pink
he
smacked
his
lips
madame
what
a
reward
for
your
great
your
excellent
courage
he
handed
back
both
pages
to
me
and
began
on
his
again
i
took
the
translation
and
read
it
eagerly
the
crown
alone
is
worth
every
risk
almost
every
crime
each
jewel
is
a
fortune
to
dream
about
the
robe
is
encrusted
with
the
wealth
of
magic
if
each
stone
is
taken
out
and
offered
cautiously
for
sale
at
different
and
widely
separated
places
the
danger
of
detection
would
now
be
very
slight
you
will
have
at
each
sale
the
dowry
of
a
queen
and
all
of
this
splendor
is
hidden
in
the
wall
there
are
two
ways
of
reaching
it
the
easier
is
through
the
hole
in
the
kitchen
closet
the
closet
under
the
stairs
these
are
directions
easy
to
remember
and
easier
to
follow
go
up
the
sixteen
steps
go
along
the
passage
to
the
inclined
plane
ascend
the
inclined
plane
count
five
rafters
from
the
first
perpendicular
rafter
from
the
top
of
the
plane
on
your
left
side
the
fifth
rafter
if
strongly
moved
pulls
forward
behind
it
on
end
stands
the
iron
box
the
key
is
hidden
back
of
the
eighteenth
brick
to
the
left
of
the
fifth
rafter
on
the
row
which
is
the
thirtieth
from
the
floor
of
the
passage
have
courage
have
have
always
a
watchful
eye
for
her
she
this
was
not
signed
now
i
did
a
careful
thing
i
read
this
translation
over
five
or
six
times
and
then
i
memorized
the
directions
sixteen
steps
up
ascend
the
inclined
plane
five
rafters
from
the
one
on
your
left
at
the
top
of
the
plane
the
eighteenth
brick
to
the
left
of
the
fifth
rafter
in
the
thirtieth
row
and
then
i
repeated
sixteen
five
eighteen
thirty
till
they
made
an
unforgettable
jingle
in
my
brain
you
will
not
forget
me
madame
murmured
the
priest
this
time
in
russian
madame
ruined
me
and
madame
will
lift
me
i
lifted
my
eyes
from
the
paper
and
smiled
that
horrible
smile
i
will
not
forget
you
i
said
in
the
same
tongue
you
will
still
be
at
the
address
until
you
advise
me
to
change
it
he
said
cringingly
excellent
he
stood
up
and
blessed
me
i
bent
my
head
and
he
stalked
out
his
long
light
hair
flapping
against
his
shoulders
as
he
walked
the
clerks
at
the
counter
gaped
and
tittered
at
him
i
followed
him
to
the
door
there
he
made
me
another
bow
smiled
a
big
toothless
smile
mounted
his
and
went
off
at
a
tremendous
speed
his
deformed
hands
hooked
over
the
bars
the
wind
of
his
own
motion
sending
the
long
points
of
his
beard
flying
behind
him
like
pennons
a
few
moments
after
his
departure
another
man
came
out
of
the
saloon
opposite
walked
quickly
to
another
mounted
it
and
went
humming
after
the
cloud
of
dust
that
hid
my
mysterious
translator
it
was
odd
that
sleepy
pine
cone
should
at
the
same
time
entertain
two
such
travelers
on
this
vehicle
it
was
even
more
odd
that
the
second
traveler
bore
so
extraordinary
a
likeness
to
one
of
brane
outdoor
men
those
whom
she
had
described
to
me
as
her
pet
charity
i
might
have
followed
this
train
of
thought
to
its
logical
conclusion
i
might
even
have
remembered
that
one
of
these
same
men
had
followed
the
baron
departure
from
the
pines
had
i
not
at
the
moment
glanced
in
the
opposite
direction
and
seen
far
along
the
wide
dusty
highway
the
departing
with
george
fat
person
perched
upon
its
seat
i
was
possessed
by
indignation
he
was
actually
leaving
pine
cone
without
me
he
was
already
too
far
away
to
hear
my
angry
shout
even
if
he
had
not
been
deaf
as
i
watched
helplessly
gregory
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
deliberately
passed
it
and
pulled
the
dilapidated
whip
fat
george
and
all
out
of
my
sight
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
a
walk
home
i
got
a
wretched
lunch
in
the
ice
cream
parlor
and
set
out
in
no
very
good
humor
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
sight
of
the
town
i
took
out
my
translation
of
the
chart
refreshed
my
memory
for
the
last
time
tore
it
into
a
thousand
tiny
bits
and
buried
the
shreds
deep
in
the
sandy
soil
of
the
roadside
i
kept
the
original
slavonic
writing
in
the
bosom
of
my
dress
i
meant
in
my
own
good
time
to
let
this
paper
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
thieves
and
so
having
notified
the
police
to
catch
them
in
the
very
i
stepped
along
rapidly
it
was
now
past
noon
a
mild
november
day
of
indian
summer
warmth
and
softness
the
pines
swung
their
fragrant
branches
against
the
sky
it
was
very
still
and
pleasant
on
the
woody
road
i
was
really
glad
that
george
had
forgotten
me
as
i
came
round
one
of
the
pretty
turns
of
the
road
i
heard
a
great
groaning
rush
of
sound
and
hurrying
my
steps
found
that
the
great
dead
pine
george
had
pointed
out
to
me
had
indeed
true
to
his
prophecy
fallen
across
the
road
it
was
a
great
ragged
giant
of
a
tree
and
as
the
bank
on
one
side
of
the
road
was
steep
and
high
i
was
forced
to
go
well
into
the
woods
on
the
other
and
to
circle
about
the
enormous
root
which
stood
up
like
a
wall
between
me
and
the
road
back
of
the
tree
i
stepped
down
into
a
hollow
and
as
i
stepped
looking
carefully
to
my
footing
for
the
ground
was
very
rough
a
heavy
smother
of
cloth
fell
over
my
head
and
shoulders
and
i
was
thrown
violently
backward
to
the
ground
at
the
same
instant
the
stuff
was
pulled
tight
across
my
mouth
i
could
hardly
breathe
much
less
cry
out
i
was
half
suffocated
and
blind
as
a
mole
my
arms
were
seized
and
drawn
back
of
me
and
tied
at
the
wrists
the
hands
that
did
this
were
fine
and
cold
and
strong
as
steel
they
were
a
woman
hands
and
i
could
feel
the
brush
of
skirts
it
froze
my
blood
to
know
that
i
was
being
handled
and
trussed
up
by
a
pitiless
image
of
myself
having
made
me
entirely
blind
dumb
and
helpless
as
a
log
the
creature
proceeded
to
search
me
with
the
most
intolerable
thoroughness
of
course
the
paper
i
had
taken
from
the
bookcase
was
promptly
found
and
i
heard
a
little
gasp
of
satisfaction
followed
by
a
low
oath
when
she
discovered
the
nature
of
the
script
she
was
no
doubt
furious
at
not
being
able
to
find
any
translation
i
was
roughly
handled
dragged
about
on
the
stony
ground
tossed
this
way
and
that
while
the
cold
hurried
clever
fingers
thrust
themselves
through
my
clothing
at
last
they
fairly
stripped
me
every
article
was
shaken
out
or
torn
apart
a
knife
cut
off
the
top
of
my
leaving
my
face
in
its
tight
smother
my
hair
was
taken
down
shaken
out
combed
with
hasty
and
painful
claws
when
after
a
horrible
lifetime
of
fear
and
disgust
anger
and
pain
the
thing
that
handled
me
discovered
that
there
was
really
nothing
further
of
any
value
to
her
upon
me
she
gave
way
to
a
fury
of
disappointment
there
in
the
still
woods
she
cursed
with
disgusting
oaths
she
beat
me
with
her
hands
with
branches
she
found
near
me
on
the
ground
discipline
she
said
discipline
and
be
thankful
my
girl
that
i
do
do
you
a
worse
injury
i
ca
stand
being
angry
unless
i
make
somebody
squirm
for
it
besides
i
mean
you
to
lie
quiet
for
a
day
or
two
till
i
need
you
i
did
squirm
and
she
showed
no
mercy
nevertheless
she
began
to
be
afraid
i
suppose
of
being
discovered
at
her
cruelty
she
threw
my
clothes
over
me
laughed
at
my
plight
and
i
heard
her
light
footsteps
going
away
from
me
into
the
woods
i
lay
there
raging
sobbing
struggling
till
long
after
dusk
then
my
hands
becoming
gradually
loosened
i
wriggled
one
hand
free
tore
the
rope
from
the
other
rid
myself
of
the
sacking
on
my
head
and
sat
up
panting
trembling
exhausted
bathed
in
sweat
slowly
i
got
into
my
clothes
and
smoothed
my
torn
hair
crying
with
the
pain
of
my
hurts
it
had
been
an
orgy
of
rage
and
cruelty
and
i
had
been
god
knows
a
helpless
victim
nevertheless
the
discipline
inflicted
upon
me
did
not
break
my
spirit
i
was
lashed
and
stung
to
a
cold
rage
of
hatred
and
disgust
i
would
outwit
the
creature
hunt
her
down
and
give
her
to
justice
so
that
she
might
suffer
for
her
sins
i
could
not
well
understand
the
furious
boldness
of
her
action
of
this
afternoon
why
did
she
leave
me
to
make
my
escape
to
go
back
to
the
pines
to
tell
my
story
and
so
to
set
the
police
on
her
track
for
some
reason
she
must
rely
on
my
holding
my
tongue
as
i
stumbled
on
my
painful
way
the
reason
came
to
me
with
some
certainty
she
thought
that
i
too
meant
to
steal
the
fortune
it
would
not
enter
the
head
of
a
criminal
that
such
a
temptation
could
be
resisted
by
a
penniless
girl
of
my
history
and
indeed
what
other
explanation
could
she
possibly
entertain
for
my
previous
secretiveness
naturally
she
could
not
understand
my
desire
to
triumph
over
paul
dabney
and
this
desire
was
as
strong
in
me
as
ever
it
had
been
indeed
i
felt
that
in
a
certain
way
the
events
of
the
afternoon
left
me
with
slight
advantage
over
my
double
it
was
now
a
race
between
us
she
knew
that
i
was
on
the
track
of
the
treasure
she
knew
that
i
knew
of
her
intentions
i
had
the
translation
she
had
not
she
would
have
it
soon
enough
i
was
sure
therefore
i
must
be
quick
no
later
than
that
night
or
at
farthest
the
following
night
while
she
still
fancied
me
laid
up
by
the
beating
i
had
received
i
must
contrive
to
get
at
brane
fortune
dreadful
as
my
experience
had
been
i
was
still
bent
upon
the
success
of
my
venture
truly
i
believe
i
was
more
bent
upon
it
if
i
failed
now
there
was
no
knowing
what
consequences
might
fall
upon
the
pines
household
and
upon
me
very
easily
i
trembled
to
think
how
easily
some
member
of
the
family
might
be
murdered
and
i
be
made
to
appear
the
murderess
i
had
by
my
bold
course
provided
blind
justice
with
a
witnesses
against
my
innocence
the
baron
the
priest
sara
henry
paul
dabney
not
one
of
them
but
could
stand
up
and
swear
to
my
criminality
perhaps
to
a
score
of
past
crimes
as
i
limped
and
stumbled
home
wiping
the
tears
from
my
eyes
and
the
blood
from
my
chafed
face
i
decided
to
keep
the
truth
of
my
adventure
to
myself
an
accident
of
some
kind
i
must
invent
to
explain
my
plight
i
decided
that
the
fallen
pine
would
have
to
bear
the
blame
for
my
cuts
and
bruises
i
would
say
that
i
had
been
caught
by
the
slashing
outer
branches
as
it
fell
before
i
reached
the
gateway
of
the
pines
in
fact
just
as
i
was
dragging
myself
up
the
steep
slope
from
the
swamp
a
of
light
came
dancing
to
meet
me
the
circle
of
its
glow
presently
made
visible
the
unmistakable
flat
feet
of
george
who
at
sight
of
me
broke
into
a
chant
of
relief
and
of
reproach
he
set
down
his
lamp
before
me
and
held
up
his
hands
my
lordamassy

george
george
danced
a
nigger
dance
of
despair
a
sort
of
grotesque
and
laughable
in
the
circle

oh

course
george
i
agreed
faintly
what
use
to
disclaim
this
minor
action
of
my
double
give
me
your
arm
there
a
good
fellow
i
been
he
was
as
tender
as
a
mammy
all
but
carried
me
up
to
the
house
and
handed
me
over
to
paul
dabney
who
was
pacing
the
hall
like
a
caged
tiger
and
who
received
me
with
a
feverish
eagerness
rather
like
the
pounce
of
a
watchful
beast
of
prey
i
told
my
story
or
rather
my
fabrication
to
him
and
brane
and
mary
paul
did
not
join
in
the
ejaculation
of
sympathy
and
affection
he
tried
to
be
stoically
cynical
even
in
the
face
of
my
quite
apparent
weakness
and
pain
but
i
thought
his
eyes
and
mouth
corners
rather
betrayed
his
and
he
helped
me
carefully
with
a
sort
of
restrained
passion
up
to
my
room
where
i
refused
poor
mary
offers
of
help
and
ministered
to
myself
as
best
i
could
i
was
really
in
a
pitiful
condition
the
beating
had
been
delivered
with
the
intention
of
laying
me
up
and
i
began
to
think
that
it
would
be
successful
i
do
mind
admitting
that
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
that
night
chapter
xiv
my
first
move
woman
who
had
so
unmercifully
used
me
had
not
taken
into
account
the
fact
that
the
spirit
is
stronger
than
the
flesh
certainly
the
next
morning
i
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
lie
still
in
my
bed
for
a
week
my
cuts
and
bruises
were
stiff
and
sore
i
ached
from
head
to
foot
but
my
resolution
was
strong
i
had
my
meals
sent
up
to
me
that
day
however
but
in
the
evening
after
dinner
i
sent
for
sara
she
came
and
presented
herself
sullen
and
impassive
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
her
as
coldly
and
malevolently
as
i
could
sara
i
said
as
you
see
i
chose
to
be
laid
up
she
grinned
now
without
a
moment
delay
i
want
you
to
leave
for
pine
cone
and
stay
there
for
the
next
hours
or
until
i
send
for
she
looked
surprised
and
reluctant
a
red
flush
came
up
into
her
big
face
so
you
can
make
off
with
the
swag
she
muttered
then
shrank
at
the
scowl
i
gave
her
and
made
an
awkward
and
unwilling
apology
all
right
then
she
said
how
about
the
work
what
about
brane
i
make
it
right
with
brane
i
said
crisply
trust
me
for
that
now
before
you
go
step
over
to
the
desk
there
and
write
what
i
tell
she
obeyed
and
i
dictated
slowly
meet
me
on
bridge
at
eleven
wait
for
me
till
i
come
she
looked
at
me
with
her
lids
narrowed
suspiciously
and
my
heart
quailed
but
the
moment
of
inspection
passed
in
fact
nobody
could
have
imagined
the
resemblance
that
undoubtedly
existed
between
the
leader
of
the
enterprise
and
my
wretched
daring
self
who
that
for
she
asked
and
what
up
ai
i
to
know
anything
what
price
all
this
what
price
i
echoed
just
our
lives
that
all
do
as
i
say
and
you
be
a
wealthy
woman
in
a
fortnight
do
do
it
even
a
little
of
it
and
and
perhaps
you
can
guess
where
and
what
you
will
she
gave
me
a
hunted
look
glanced
about
the
room
over
her
shoulder
and
obedient
to
my
gesture
handed
me
the
paper
she
had
written
and
no
questions
asked
i
added
sternly
do
let
me
hear
another
word
of
it
now
get
my
cloak
and
hat
and
leave
them
in
the
kitchen
on
the
chair
near
the
stove
get
out
as
soon
as
you
can
do
wait
a
minute
and
leave
the
kitchen
door
unlocked
go
all
the
way
to
pine
cone
and
stay
in
the
room
above
the
the
woman
is
always
ready
to
take
a
boarder
i
send
you
word
before
night
get
out
and
be
quick
above
all
do
be
on
the
bridge
she
vanished
like
a
shadow
and
i
sat
waiting
with
a
pounding
heart
if
she
fell
in
with
that
double
now
my
game
was
up
everything
depended
upon
her
leaving
the
house
without
any
conflicting
orders
without
her
suspecting
my
duplicity
i
sat
up
in
bed
till
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
had
time
to
get
my
hat
and
cloak
and
to
make
her
own
preparations
then
wincing
with
pain
i
dragged
myself
up
and
limped
over
to
my
window
a
moment
later
sara
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
started
down
the
road
there
was
just
enough
twilight
for
me
to
make
her
out
she
walked
slowly
and
doggedly
carrying
a
little
bag
in
her
hand
i
wondered
if
mary
would
come
flying
to
me
with
the
news
of
this
departure
or
if
brane
and
paul
dabney
would
observe
it
no
attempt
was
made
to
stop
her
however
or
to
call
her
back
she
went
on
stolidly
and
stolidly
passed
out
of
my
sight
it
was
in
strange
circumstances
that
i
saw
her
big
handsome
face
again
i
waited
till
i
thought
she
must
have
had
time
to
reach
the
lane
outside
of
the
pines
gate
then
i
began
painfully
slowly
to
creep
into
my
clothes
often
i
had
to
rest
several
times
i
stopped
to
cry
for
pain
but
i
kept
on
and
at
last
i
stood
fully
dressed
before
my
mirror
my
mouth
was
cut
and
torn
my
face
scratched
a
raw
patch
on
one
cheek
the
marks
of
the
branch
lay
red
across
the
base
of
my
neck
and
burned
about
my
shoulders
the
sight
of
my
injuries
and
the
pain
of
them
throbbing
afresh
with
movement
inflamed
my
anger
and
my
courage
i
moved
about
the
room
several
times
gradually
limbering
myself
then
i
went
quietly
out
of
my
room
and
down
the
hall
towards
the
kitchen
stairs
it
was
then
about
ten
brane
and
paul
dabney
were
probably
in
the
quietly
sipping
their
coffee
mary
would
be
upstairs
preparing
brane
bedroom
for
the
night
henry
would
have
washed
up
his
dishes
and
be
gone
upstairs
to
his
room
unless
he
had
received
some
further
orders
from
the
hidden
mistress
of
the
house
i
had
to
take
this
risk
i
stole
down
the
kitchen
stairs
and
opening
the
door
a
crack
i
peeped
into
the
kitchen
the
lamp
had
been
turned
low
the
fire
was
banked
up
for
the
night
a
plate
with
cup
and
fork
and
spoon
was
laid
out
on
the
kitchen
table
and
on
the
back
of
the
stove
a
full
of
food
was
set
to
keep
warm
what
a
sara
must
think
her
leader
whom
she
saw
eating
heartily
enough
at
brane
table
but
who
insisted
besides
on
a
heavy
meal
at
night
i
thought
i
knew
who
would
presently
appear
to
enjoy
her
supper
she
would
fancy
the
kitchen
door
securely
locked
she
would
fancy
that
i
was
successfully
laid
by
the
heels
i
wondered
what
her
plans
for
the
night
might
be
i
set
my
teeth
hard
to
keep
down
the
rage
that
mounted
in
me
at
the
very
thought
of
her
sara
had
obediently
placed
my
cloak
and
hat
on
one
of
the
kitchen
chairs
i
decided
that
there
was
no
time
to
waste
i
slipped
quickly
into
the
room
i
was
in
stocking
feet
locked
the
kitchen
door
hid
the
key
in
my
pocket
put
the
note
that
i
had
dictated
to
sara
under
the
plate
on
the
table
and
then
stealing
softly
to
the
door
of
a
narrow
closet
where
sara
kept
her
brooms
i
squeezed
myself
in
and
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
when
the
key
was
removed
i
put
my
eye
to
the
large
worn
keyhole
and
had
a
clear
but
limited
view
of
the
dim
empty
room
i
knelt
as
comfortably
as
i
could
for
i
knew
that
i
should
have
to
keep
my
position
without
the
motion
of
a
finger
when
the
room
should
have
an
occupant
my
heart
beat
heavily
and
loudly
my
hurts
throbbed
at
every
beat
it
was
a
painful
a
unbearable
that
i
spent
cramped
there
in
the
closet
waiting
waiting
waiting
at
last
such
a
long
last
there
came
the
ghostly
sound
of
a
step
it
drew
nearer
i
heard
a
faint
noise
of
shifting
boards
the
door
of
the
low
closet
under
the
stairs
opened
and
out
stepped
the
hideous
image
of
myself
the
shock
of
that
resemblance
almost
sent
me
off
into
a
faint
i
had
seen
the
creature
only
once
face
to
face
now
in
the
dim
light
of
the
kitchen
lamp
i
studied
her
features
disfigured
by
passion
and
guilt
it
was
nevertheless
my
face
this
woman
was
older
certainly
by
many
years
but
a
touch
of
paint
and
powder
the
radiance
of
moonlight
might
easily
disguise
the
lines
and
shadows
she
was
as
slender
as
a
girl
and
a
clever
actress
could
simulate
a
look
of
innocence
i
almost
forgave
paul
dabney
as
i
watched
this
other
me
move
about
the
kitchen
on
her
noiseless
feet
she
went
to
the
stove
took
up
the
and
carried
it
over
to
the
table
on
the
way
she
noticed
my
cloak
and
hat
and
stopped
evidently
startled
holding
the
pan
in
her
hands
she
glanced
nervously
about
the
room
went
over
to
the
door
that
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
tried
it
i
was
thankful
that
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
locking
it
i
hoped
she
would
not
notice
that
the
key
was
gone
she
returned
to
the
table
and
sat
down
before
the
plate
then
she
saw
the
note
and
snatched
it
up
she
bent
her
fiery
head
arranged
so
carefully
in
imitation
of
mine
over
the
writing
i
saw
her
lips
move
she
looked
up
frowning
uncertain
surprised
then
she
walked
over
to
the
stove
thrust
sara
note
into
the
fire
returned
and
stood
in
deep
thought
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
was
sick
with
suspense
clouds
passed
over
my
eyes
would
she
fall
into
my
clumsy
trap
presently
she
walked
slowly
over
to
my
cloak
and
hat
and
put
them
on
with
the
hat
pressing
her
soft
hair
down
about
her
face
she
was
so
terribly
like
me
that
my
uncanny
fears
returned
she
must
be
some
spirit
clothed
in
my
aura
possessing
herself
in
some
infernal
fashion
of
my
outward
semblance
a
cold
sweat
had
broken
out
over
me
i
felt
it
run
down
my
temples
another
long
minute
she
stood
there
debating
with
herself
then
she
looked
at
the
clock
made
use
of
her
ghastly
smile
and
stepped
quietly
across
the
kitchen
and
out
into
the
night
i
waited
a
fortunate
precaution
for
she
came
back
five
minutes
later
and
peered
about
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
her
since
she
could
not
hear
the
pounding
of
my
heart
she
decided
to
follow
the
instructions
and
again
disappeared
i
waited
another
fifteen
minutes
then
cold
with
fear
and
excitement
i
came
out
of
my
i
glided
over
to
the
door
and
looked
out
it
was
a
dark
and
cloudy
night
i
could
hear
the
swinging
and
rustling
of
the
trees
there
was
no
other
sound
nor
could
i
see
anything
astir
in
the
little
garden
except
the
gate
which
was
ajar
and
creaking
faintly
on
its
hinges
she
had
gone
i
came
back
hastily
into
the
kitchen
and
lighted
a
candle
which
was
stuck
into
a
tin
candlestick
on
a
shelf
i
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
now
ten
in
half
an
hour
the
woman
would
reach
the
bridge
she
would
wait
for
maida
perhaps
an
hour
perhaps
not
so
long
after
that
she
would
be
suspicious
and
return
i
had
therefore
not
more
than
an
hour
with
any
certainty
to
follow
the
directions
i
had
memorized
to
rifle
the
hoard
and
to
make
my
escape
from
the
thief
then
i
would
telephone
to
the
pine
cone
police
i
opened
the
door
of
the
low
closet
under
the
stairs
chapter
xv
the
secret
of
the
kitchen
closet
lighted
my
candle
and
stepped
into
the
closet
shutting
the
door
behind
me
the
small
space
no
longer
cluttered
by
old
odds
and
ends
of
gardening
tools
was
clear
to
my
eyes
in
every
corner
and
presented
so
commonplace
an
appearance
that
i
was
almost
ready
to
believe
that
nightmares
had
possessed
me
lately
and
that
an
especially
vivid
one
had
brought
me
to
stand
absurdly
here
in
the
sleeping
house
peering
at
an
innocent
board
wall
nevertheless
i
set
down
my
candle
on
the
floor
and
attacked
the
boards
put
up
by
henry
with
what
skill
and
energy
i
could
they
moved
at
once
as
though
they
were
on
oiled
hinges
and
the
whole
low
side
of
the
closet
came
forward
in
my
hands
before
me
opened
the
black
hole
into
which
i
had
fallen
the
morning
when
mary
and
i
had
explored
the
kitchen
after
delia
departure
i
did
not
know
what
lay
there
in
the
dark
but
unless
i
had
the
courage
of
my
final
adventure
there
was
no
use
in
having
braved
and
endured
so
much
i
slid
my
lighted
candle
ahead
of
me
and
crept
along
the
floor
into
the
hole
i
had
to
creep
only
for
an
instant
then
damp
cool
space
opened
above
my
head
and
i
stood
up
i
was
in
a
narrow
passageway
of
enormous
height
in
fact
the
whole
outer
wall
of
the
house
stood
at
my
right
hand
and
the
whole
inner
wall
at
my
left
crossed
here
and
there
by
the
beams
of
the
deep
window
sills
to
which
brane
had
called
my
attention
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
at
the
it
was
the
most
curious
place
a
foot
or
two
in
front
of
me
a
narrow
stairs
made
of
and
odd
pieces
of
lumber
nailed
together
went
up
between
the
walls
holding
my
candle
high
so
that
as
far
as
possible
i
could
see
before
and
above
me
i
began
to
mount
the
steps
i
was
weak
with
excitement
and
with
the
heavy
beating
of
my
heart
i
counted
sixteen
steps
and
saw
that
i
had
come
to
the
top
of
the
queer
flight
the
narrow
enormously
high
passage
like
an
alley
between
towering
led
on
with
an
odd
look
somewhere
ahead
of
me
sloping
up
i
walked
perhaps
twenty
steps
and
saw
that
i
had
come
to
the
foot
of
an
inclined
plane
probably
brane
had
found
it
easier
of
construction
than
his
amateur
stairs
i
mounted
it
slowly
stopping
to
listen
and
to
hold
my
breath
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
but
the
faint
scuttling
of
rats
and
the
faint
faint
pressure
of
my
steps
i
realized
that
i
must
now
be
on
a
level
with
the
passage
in
the
northern
wing
and
that
here
it
was
that
the
various
housekeepers
and
servants
had
heard
a
ghostly
footfall
or
a
gusty
sigh
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
play
ghost
here
in
fact
i
felt
like
an
unholy
spirit
entombed
between
the
walls
of
the
sleeping
unsuspecting
house
i
reached
the
top
of
the
inclined
plane
and
stopped
with
my
left
hand
against
the
wall
here
i
could
see
a
long
row
of
parallel
rafters
between
which
ran
horizontal
beams
in
the
spaces
so
enclosed
lay
the
rows
of
bricks
hardened
cement
curling
along
their
edges
my
hand
rested
against
the
first
parallel
rafter
on
the
left
side
i
began
to
count
one
two
three
four
five
this
was
certainly
the
fifth
rafter
on
the
left
wall
from
the
top
of
the
inclined
plane
i
put
down
my
candle
if
my
chart
was
right
and
not
the
crazy
fiction
of
a
diseased
brain
as
i
half
imagined
it
to
be
this
fifth
rafter
hid
the
iron
box
in
which
lay
a
treasure
thought
by
the
writer
of
the
directions
to
be
worthy
of
any
risk
almost
of
any
i
put
my
arms
out
at
a
level
with
my
shoulders
and
grasped
the
beam
in
both
hands
i
pulled
instantly
a
section
about
as
long
as
myself
moved
forward
i
pulled
again
this
time
the
heavy
beam
came
out
suddenly
and
i
fell
with
it
the
thud
seemed
to
me
loud
enough
to
wake
the
dead
i
crouched
holding
my
breath
where
i
had
fallen
then
freeing
myself
from
the
beam
which
had
caught
my
skirt
i
stood
up
i
peered
into
the
opening
behind
the
beam
in
the
narrow
darkness
of
the
space
there
seemed
to
be
a
narrower
denser
darkness
i
put
my
hand
on
it
and
touched
the
edge
of
a
long
narrow
box
instantly
the
fascination
of
all
stories
of
hidden
treasure
the
wonder
thrill
of
ali
baba
hidden
cave
the
spell
of
monte
cristo
had
me
and
i
felt
no
fear
of
any
kind
wounds
and
pains
and
terrors
dropped
from
me
i
pulled
out
the
box
as
boldly
and
as
eagerly
as
any
pirate
in
a
tale
it
was
heavy
the
box
i
eased
it
to
the
floor
and
laid
it
flat
it
was
an
old
shallow
box
of
iron
rusted
and
stained
there
was
no
mark
of
any
kind
upon
it
just
a
keyhole
in
the
front
i
must
now
find
the
eighteenth
brick
in
the
thirtieth
row
in
order
to
possess
myself
of
the
key
to
my
treasure
i
counted
carefully
pressing
each
brick
with
an
unsteady
feverish
finger
on
the
thirtieth
row
from
the
floor
eighteen
bricks
from
the
fifth
rafter
yes
this
was
certainly
the
thirtieth
row
i
counted
twice
to
make
sure
and
now
from
the
rafter
the
eighteenth
brick
it
looked
quite
as
secure
as
any
other
and
indeed
i
had
to
work
hard
to
clear
away
the
cement
that
held
it
in
place
when
that
was
done
i
had
no
difficulty
in
loosening
it
i
took
it
out
yes
there
behind
it
lay
an
iron
key
i
did
not
stop
to
replace
the
brick
but
hurrying
back
to
my
box
knelt
down
before
it
my
hands
were
shaking
so
that
i
had
to
steady
my
right
with
my
left
in
order
to
fit
in
the
key
it
would
not
turn
i
worked
and
twisted
and
poked
nothing
would
move
the
rusty
lock
sweat
streamed
down
my
face
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
to
the
kitchen
get
some
kerosene
pour
it
into
the
lock
and
so
oil
the
rusty
contrivance
every
minute
was
as
precious
as
life
itself
i
made
the
trip
at
desperate
speed
returned
with
a
small
bottle
full
of
oil
and
saturated
the
lock
after
another
five
minutes
of
fruitless
twisting
suddenly
the
key
turned
i
grasped
the
lid
it
opened
with
a
faint
protesting
squeak
it
seemed
to
me
at
first
that
the
box
was
full
of
bright
and
moving
life
then
i
saw
with
a
catching
breath
that
the
flame
of
my
candle
played
across
the
surface
of
a
hundred
gems
there
lay
in
the
box
an
ecclesiastical
robe
of
some
kind
encrusted
all
over
with
jewels
and
at
one
end
rested
a
slender
circlet
like
a
virgin
crown
studded
with
crimson
and
blue
and
white
and
yellow
stones
so
did
the
whole
bewildering
beautiful
thing
gleam
and
glisten
and
shoot
sparks
that
it
seemed
indeed
to
be
on
fire
i
have
never
till
that
night
felt
the
mysterious
lure
of
precious
stones
kneeling
there
alone
in
the
strange
i
was
possessed
by
an
intolerable
longing
to
escape
with
these
glittering
things
and
to
live
somewhere
in
secret
to
fondle
and
cherish
their
unearthly
fires
it
was
a
thirst
an
appetite
the
explanation
of
all
the
terrible
digging
and
delving
the
sweat
and
the
exhaustion
of
the
mine
it
was
something
akin
to
the
hypnotism
that
the
glittering
eye
of
the
serpent
has
for
its
victim
a
desire
a
peril
rooted
deep
in
the
hearts
of
men
one
of
the
most
mysterious
things
in
our
mysterious
spirit
i
knelt
there
forgetful
of
my
danger
forgetful
of
my
life
forgetful
of
everything
except
the
beauty
of
those
stones
then
with
a
violent
start
i
remembered
i
carefully
drew
out
the
robe
laid
it
over
my
arm
and
taking
the
heavy
circlet
in
my
hand
i
prepared
myself
for
flight
the
load
was
extraordinarily
heavy
i
bent
under
it
i
had
taken
perhaps
six
steps
towards
safety
when
i
heard
a
sound
it
was
not
the
sound
of
rats
it
was
not
the
sound
of
my
own
light
step
it
was
something
else
i
did
not
know
what
that
sound
was
but
some
instinct
told
me
that
it
was
a
danger
signal
i
put
out
my
candle
and
flattened
myself
against
the
wall
then
i
did
distinctly
hear
an
approaching
step
it
was
not
anywhere
else
in
the
house
it
was
between
those
two
walls
it
was
ascending
the
steps
it
was
coming
up
the
plane
through
the
pitchy
darkness
it
advanced
bringing
with
it
no
light
but
moving
surely
as
though
it
knew
every
step
of
the
way
there
was
hardly
room
for
two
people
between
those
high
walls
any
one
passing
me
where
i
stood
must
brush
against
me
i
dared
not
move
even
to
lay
down
my
treasure
and
put
myself
into
an
attitude
of
i
thought
that
my
only
chance
lay
in
the
miracle
of
being
passed
without
notice
near
to
me
the
footsteps
stopped
and
i
remembered
that
any
foot
coming
along
the
passage
would
perforce
strike
against
the
box
and
the
fallen
beam
there
was
no
hope
nevertheless
like
some
frozen
image
i
stood
there
clasping
the
robe
and
crown
incapable
of
motion
incapable
of
thought
i
could
hear
a
faint
breathing
in
the
dark
it
was
not
more
than
two
feet
away
from
me
it
seemed
to
my
straining
eyeballs
that
i
could
make
out
the
lines
of
a
body
standing
there
its
blank
face
turned
in
my
direction
then
my
heart
leaped
with
the
terror
of
it
the
invisible
being
laughed
you
have
gone
said
the
low
sweet
horrible
voice
i
can
smell
the
candle
so
you
must
have
put
it
out
when
you
heard
me
if
i
had
struck
my
foot
against
a
board
i
have
come
upon
you
in
the
midst
of
your
interesting
work
there
no
place
to
hide
here
you
either
run
back
to
the
end
of
the
passage
and
crept
in
under
my
bedclothes
or
you
flattened
up
against
the
wall
i
think
you
near
me
i
think
i
hear
your
heart
no
doubt
she
did
it
was
laboring
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
she
paused
probably
to
listen
to
my
pounding
blood
then
she
laughed
again
you
badly
scared
are
you
it
a
feeling
of
security
my
girl
compared
to
the
fright
you
get
later
why
you
scream
too
scared
or
are
you
afraid
you
kill
somebody
else
besides
robbie
of
fright
a
ghost
screaming
in
the
wall
grrrrrr
i
can
give
no
idea
of
the
terrible
sound
she
made
in
her
throat
and
the
truth
was
i
could
scream
i
was
pinned
there
against
the
wall
as
though
there
were
hands
around
my
neck
she
made
a
step
forward
it
was
like
a
ghastly
game
of
blind
man
buff
most
of
those
games
must
be
based
on
fearful
of
outgrown
terrors
then
she
gave
a
sudden
spring
to
one
side
an
instinctive
beastlike
movement
and
her
hand
struck
my
face
instantly
she
had
flung
herself
upon
me
i
let
fall
my
booty
and
fought
with
all
my
strength
i
might
as
well
have
struggled
with
a
tigress
she
was
made
of
strings
of
steel
her
arms
and
legs
twisted
about
me
like
serpents
her
furious
strength
was
disgusting
loathsome
her
breath
beat
upon
my
face
i
fell
under
her
and
she
turned
up
my
skirt
over
my
head
fastening
it
in
the
darkness
with
such
devilish
quick
skill
that
i
could
not
move
my
arms
also
she
crammed
fold
after
fold
into
my
mouth
till
i
was
gagged
my
jaws
forced
open
till
they
ached
the
pain
in
my
throat
and
neck
was
intolerable
then
groping
about
she
found
the
candle
and
i
heard
her
strike
a
match
afterwards
she
inspected
the
treasure
drawing
deep
sighs
of
satisfaction
and
murmuring
to
herself
after
a
long
time
of
enjoyment
she
sat
down
beside
me
placing
the
candle
so
that
it
shone
upon
me
i
could
see
the
light
through
the
thinnish
stuff
over
my
face
now
janice
she
said
i
shall
make
you
more
comfortable
and
then
i
shall
afford
you
some
of
the
most
excellent
entertainment
you
can
well
imagine
there
are
people
all
over
the
world
who
would
give
ten
years
of
their
lives
to
hear
what
you
are
going
to
hear
i
have
some
interesting
stories
to
tell
there
is
plenty
of
time
before
us
i
shall
not
have
to
leave
you
till
just
before
daybreak
and
we
might
as
well
have
a
pleasant
time
together
i
was
too
busy
the
other
afternoon
in
the
woods
and
too
hurried
to
give
you
any
real
attention
this
time
i
shall
do
my
duty
by
you
you
are
really
rather
a
remarkable
girl
and
i
am
proud
of
you
that
beating
i
gave
you
would
have
laid
up
most
young
women
for
a
fortnight
but
you
are
made
of
adventurous
she
sighed
a
strange
sound
to
come
from
her
lips
then
skillfully
she
drew
the
skirt
partially
from
my
face
possessed
herself
of
my
hands
which
she
bound
securely
with
a
string
she
took
from
her
pocket
a
piece
of
twine
which
if
i
stirred
a
finger
cut
into
my
wrists
like
a
knife
she
gradually
drew
the
gag
out
of
my
mouth
keeping
a
strangling
hold
on
my
throat
as
she
did
so
and
when
my
jaw
snapped
back
in
place
it
had
been
almost
out
of
its
socket
still
keeping
that
grip
on
my
she
tied
a
silk
handkerchief
over
my
mouth
knotting
it
tightly
behind
my
head
then
she
released
me
and
moved
a
little
away
i
looked
at
her
no
doubt
with
the
eyes
of
a
trapped
animal
so
that
bending
down
to
inspect
me
she
laughed
again
i
not
going
to
kill
you
you
know
she
said
sweetly
not
yet
i
could
have
killed
you
the
other
day
if
it
had
been
more
to
my
purpose
to
let
you
live
i
could
have
killed
you
any
time
these
past
few
weeks
do
you
know
that
you
silly
reckless
child
all
of
you
here
in
this
absurd
house
lay
in
the
hollow
of
my
she
held
out
one
of
her
very
long
slender
hands
so
like
my
own
as
she
spoke
and
slowly
tensely
drew
her
fingers
together
as
though
she
were
crushing
some
small
live
thing
to
death
i
did
really
mean
to
kill
robbie
but
i
did
mean
to
get
him
out
of
that
room
alive
or
dead
he
killed
himself
which
saved
me
the
trouble
i
do
like
killing
children
it
quite
untrue
what
they
say
of
me
in
that
respect
though
i
been
driven
to
it
once
or
twice
it
being
too
squeamish
about
babies
lives
put
an
end
to
most
careers
of
burglary
that
the
god
truth
janice
you
shaking
are
you
how
queer
it
must
be
to
have
nerves
like
that
young
innocent
ignorant
nerves
poor
janice
poor
little
facsimile
of
myself
what
explanation
did
you
find
for
that
resemblance
i
fancied
you
frighten
yourself
into
a
superstitious
spasm
over
it
and
stop
your
for
good
but
you
did
i
be
bound
though
that
the
true
explanation
never
occurred
to
i
had
been
staring
up
into
her
beautiful
ghastly
face
but
now
i
closed
my
eyes
a
most
intolerable
thought
had
come
to
me
it
came
slowly
gropingly
out
of
the
remote
past
and
it
turned
my
heart
into
a
heavy
gray
stone
are
you
remembering
janice
no
that
not
possible
you
were
too
she
leaned
over
me
again
and
pushed
back
a
lock
of
hair
that
had
been
troubling
my
eyes
you
grown
to
be
a
very
beautiful
i
groaned
aloud
and
writhed
there
i
knew
the
truth
now
there
was
a
mother
from
whom
i
had
been
taken
when
i
was
a
few
months
old
a
mother
of
whom
my
father
would
never
let
me
speak
a
mother
i
had
been
told
to
forget
to
blot
out
of
my
imagination
as
though
she
had
never
been
what
dreadful
reason
my
father
must
have
had
for
his
secret
sordid
manner
of
living
what
a
shadow
had
lain
on
my
childhood
with
its
drab
wanderings
its
homelessness
its
disgraceful
shifts
and
pitiful
poverty
all
that
misery
which
i
had
tried
so
hard
to
forget
in
the
new
land
came
back
upon
me
now
with
an
added
crushing
weight
i
lay
there
and
longed
to
die
the
woman
began
to
talk
again
yes
she
said
i
am
your
mother
my
name
was
wenda
tour
and
i
married
sergius
gale
who
was
your
father
i
am
and
he
was
when
i
married
him
he
was
an
innocent
little
student
at
the
university
of
moscow
i
was
only
sixteen
myself
training
for
a
dancer
acting
a
clever
abused
gifted
young
waif
and
fairly
innocent
too
though
i
always
been
and
skillful
at
all
sorts
of
tricks
i
think
i
was
in
love
with
sergius
at
any
rate
i
was
anxious
to
escape
from
the
trainer
who
was
a
brute
but
sergius
began
to
bore
me
oh
my
god
how
insufferably
he
bored
me
and
he
was
so
wearisomely
weak
weaker
than
most
men
and
the
lord
knows
they
mostly
made
of
butter
or
mixtures
and
you
bored
me
dreadfully
too
the
very
thought
of
you
before
you
came
filled
me
with
a
real
distaste
for
life
by
the
time
you
made
your
squalling
entrance
into
the
world
i
had
got
myself
into
rather
complicated
trouble
and
managed
to
make
a
scapegoat
of
your
father
the
poor
fool
it
was
a
sharp
business
and
it
might
have
made
us
both
rich
but
i
was
clumsier
than
i
am
now
and
sergius
was
a
hindrance
it
did
quite
go
through
and
i
had
to
make
a
a
quick
one
i
made
some
even
quicker
since
then
after
he
spent
some
sobering
and
salutary
months
in
a
russian
prison
your
father
came
out
reformed
and
completely
cured
of
his
passion
for
vixens
with
a
natural
taste
for
crime
i
often
wondered
how
he
treated
you
little
miniature
of
myself
as
you
were
even
in
your
cradle
i
do
believe
you
had
a
very
comfortable
childhood
janice
the
crudest
thing
i
ever
did
and
the
wickedest
was
to
let
you
come
into
the
world
or
having
let
you
come
to
allow
you
to
remain
here
i
ought
to
have
put
you
out
of
your
misery
before
it
had
really
begun
you
would
be
lying
here
shaking
you
would
have
to
pay
the
piper
for
me
as
i
fear
i
shall
be
forced
to
make
you
pay
before
i
leave
you
i
hate
to
do
it
i
honestly
do
there
must
be
a
soft
spot
left
in
me
somewhere
but
there
no
use
balking
it
got
to
be
done
it
too
good
a
chance
to
miss
i
can
wipe
out
my
past
as
though
it
had
been
written
on
a
slate
you
ca
blame
me
yourself
janice
the
jewels
mean
wealth
and
your
death
means
my
freedom
when
they
find
you
here
and
they
will
find
you
they
will
think
that
they
have
found
my
corpse
do
you
see
even
maida
even
the
baron
even
jaffrey
even
the
priest
will
swear
to
it
you
see
if
you
had
been
so
clever
or
a
little
bit
cleverer
you
would
have
played
my
game
or
you
have
taken
more
pains
to
keep
your
plan
a
secret
from
me
once
i
was
sure
you
did
think
your
double
a
ghost
i
began
to
suspect
you
when
you
pulled
that
lover
of
yours
she
laughed
and
even
in
my
misery
i
felt
the
sting
of
anger
and
of
shame
of
ours
i
should
say
when
you
pulled
him
out
of
the
mud
why
i
found
myself
able
to
read
you
like
a
child
first
primer
oh
you
been
a
nuisance
to
me
kept
me
on
pins
and
needles
i
knew
you
would
dare
to
search
the
house
i
suppose
you
guessed
that
would
mean
the
end
of
your
life
but
you
certainly
given
me
some
unhappy
minutes
that
fool
of
a
baron
blabbing
out
his
secret
to
you
but
i
made
it
all
work
out
to
my
salvation
they
nabbed
the
baron
and
the
priest
i
suppose
get
maida
jaffrey
will
be
caught
snoring
in
his
bed
she
chuckled
and
there
an
end
to
all
my
partners
all
the
fools
that
thought
they
come
in
for
a
share
of
booty
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
they
never
know
how
neatly
i
bagged
them
all
and
made
a
myself
they
will
think
me
dead
they
bear
witness
point
at
your
dead
body
janice
and
say
that
she
oh
a
rare
trick
i
playing
on
the
police
on
the
gang
on
every
one
especially
that
cat
of
a
hovey
with
his
she
rubbed
her
lips
angrily
a
curious
to
me
inexplicable
gesture
but
it
a
poor
joke
for
you
my
girl
playing
your
hand
alone
against
a
lot
of
hardened
old
hands
like
us
is
a
fool
work
that
what
it
is
did
you
think
i
let
you
run
off
with
a
fortune
under
my
very
nose
no
you
have
to
pay
for
that
insolence
daughter
or
no
daughter
you
have
to
pay
at
least
i
be
saving
your
soul
alive
if
i
had
got
back
to
you
you
be
a
thief
flying
out
into
the
world
perhaps
your
dying
is
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
you
i
do
know
looking
back
well
it
hard
to
she
sat
there
thinking
forgetful
of
me
and
i
opened
my
miserable
eyes
and
stared
hopelessly
at
the
clear
hard
profile
so
beautiful
so
evil
so
unutterably
merciless
she
had
been
sixteen
when
i
was
born
twenty
years
ago
she
was
now
only
and
yet
her
face
was
almost
old
she
turned
upon
me
again
with
her
ghastly
smile
you
do
look
pleased
to
see
your
mother
my
dear
perhaps
i
was
a
trifle
rough
with
you
at
our
first
interview
but
you
been
spared
a
great
many
worse
thrashings
by
having
been
separated
from
me
at
such
an
early
age
i
have
a
devilish
temper
as
you
know
i
probably
have
flogged
you
to
death
before
you
were
out
of
your
pinafores
i
like
to
hear
your
history
oh
i
kept
track
of
its
outlines
i
always
thought
you
might
some
day
be
useful
but
i
do
dare
take
that
handkerchief
off
of
your
mouth
that
handkerchief
belonged
to
my
second
husband
the
comte
de
trème
yes
i
went
up
in
the
world
after
i
put
sergius
into
prison
i
been
a
great
lady
it
a
tremendous
advantage
to
any
career
to
learn
the
grand
air
and
to
get
a
smattering
of
education
poor
trème
he
was
quite
the
weakling
that
most
of
them
have
been
i
have
a
certain
respect
for
him
actually
he
was
a
good
man
and
no
milk
and
water
in
his
veins
either
if
any
one
could
have
exorcised
the
devil
in
me
it
was
he
he
did
his
best
but
i
was
too
much
for
him
and
in
the
end
poor
fool
he
put
a
bullet
into
his
brain
because
oh
these
idiot
aristocrats
of
the
it
was
after
trème
a
long
while
after
trème
when
i
was
queening
it
in
petersburg
because
you
see
i
did
fall
into
disgrace
at
all
i
let
trème
shoulder
it
he
was
dead
and
it
could
hurt
him
and
i
was
glad
to
stab
that
family
of
his
about
three
years
after
his
death
i
suppose
when
the
captain
came
along
brane
you
know
theodore
brane
he
was
a
handsome
chap
long
and
lean
and
i
lost
my
head
over
him
i
was
still
pretty
young
twenty
or
thereabouts
he
would
marry
me
d
him
and
i
was
a
fool
that
where
i
lost
my
footing
well
this
is
going
to
put
me
back
again
and
revenge
me
on
that
coward
we
lived
together
and
we
lived
like
princes
on
trème
fortune
you
should
have
seen
his
family
it
was
when
the
trème
estate
was
bled
dry
that
i
happened
to
remember
those
jewels
yes
seen
them
in
the
cathedral
at
moscow
in
a
secret
crypt
down
under
the
earth
i
was
a
child
at
the
time
a
little
imp
of
nine
or
ten
and
i
got
round
a
silly
old
sheep
of
a
priest
and
begged
him
so
hard
to
let
me
go
down
through
the
trapdoor
with
him
that
he
consented
he
thought
it
could
do
no
harm
i
suppose
a
child
of
that
age
i
saw
the
beloved
virgin
of
the
jewels
she
stood
there
blazing
a
candlestick
made
of
solid
gold
burning
on
her
right
hand
and
her
left
an
unforgettable
sight
the
robe
and
the
circlet
that
are
here
beside
us
now
in
brane
double
wall
in
north
carolina
god
it
strange
this
life
i
often
thought
of
that
holy
wealthy
lady
in
her
crypt
when
brane
and
i
were
at
an
end
of
our
means
and
of
our
wits
and
he
beginning
to
get
tired
of
the
connection
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
a
try
at
the
moscow
virgin
wardrobe
i
did
tell
brane
though
he
was
a
thief
himself
cashiered
from
the
british
army
for
looting
in
india
i
thought
this
scheme
would
be
a
bit
too
stiff
for
him
i
went
alone
to
moscow
and
i
became
the
most
pious
frequenter
of
ikons
the
most
devout
of
worshipers
a
generous
patron
to
all
droning
priests
and
there
was
one
one
with
a
big
oval
that
i
meant
to
corrupt
he
was
rotten
to
the
core
anyway
a
sepulcher
if
ever
there
was
one
i
got
him
so
that
he
cringed
at
my
feet
he
was
a
white
soft
worm
ugh
i
chose
him
for
the
scapegoat
that
the
real
secret
of
my
success
janice
i
never
forgot
to
provide
a
scapegoat
some
one
upon
whom
the
police
were
bound
to
tumble
headlong
at
the
very
first
investigation
i
am
afraid
you
are
the
scapegoat
this
time
you
and
this
will
give
his
a
twist
set
him
to
rights
until
next
time
it
a
rotten
trick
to
play
on
you
but
you
should
have
mixed
up
in
it
a
sensible
girl
would
have
taken
the
bait
a
slip
of
paper
handed
to
her
in
the
street
for
shame
janice
it
was
my
first
idea
and
i
laughed
at
it
i
thought
i
have
to
think
up
something
better
but
it
worked
folly
is
just
as
deserving
of
punishment
as
crime
more
so
i
believe
it
only
just
that
a
fool
should
lie
tied
up
and
gagged
that
the
way
the
world
works
and
it
not
such
a
bad
world
after
all
if
you
make
yourself
its
master
and
kick
over
a
few
conventions
well
father
gast
ate
out
of
my
hand
and
thought
me
as
beautiful
as
one
of
god
angels
only
a
little
more
merciful
to
the
desires
of
men
and
one
day
he
gave
me
a
permit
got
a
young
acolyte
of
the
cathedral
to
take
me
down
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
most
beloved
virgin
of
the
jewels
it
was
dark
in
the
crypt
except
for
the
candle
that
poor
boy
carried
above
his
head
the
virgin
stood
there
glistening
i
knelt
down
to
pray
the
boy
knelt
down
i
snatched
the
candlestick
of
gold
that
stood
on
the
virgin
right
hand
and
cracked
his
skull
he
dropped
without
so
much
as
a
whimper
then
i
stripped
our
holy
lady
and
came
up
out
of
the
she
stopped
to
draw
a
long
long
breath
as
she
must
have
stopped
when
in
the
dim
kremlin
she
had
come
up
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
carrying
her
treasure
leaving
the
boy
acolyte
senseless
before
the
naked
shrine
for
all
the
terrible
preoccupation
of
my
mind
racing
with
death
i
could
not
help
but
listen
to
her
story
my
imagination
seemed
to
be
stimulated
by
the
terror
of
my
plight
i
might
have
been
in
the
crypt
i
seemed
to
smell
the
damp
close
smell
of
chapels
i
felt
the
weight
of
the
jeweled
robe
the
fearful
necessity
for
escape
after
her
long
breath
she
began
again
eagerly
i
came
up
out
of
the
crypt
and
i
called
to
my
he
was
waiting
for
me
near
the
altar
at
his
hypocritical
prayers
he
came
quickly
over
to
me
staring
at
the
bundle
in
my
arms
and
i
kept
him
fascinated
by
the
smile
i
wore
i
can
command
the
look
in
my
eyes
at
such
moments
it
the
eyes
that
give
away
a
secret
you
can
see
the
change
of
mood
the
intention
to
deceive
the
fear
the
suspicion
the
decision
to
kill
but
even
in
those
days
i
knew
how
to
guard
my
eyes
father
gast
looked
at
me
and
i
smiled
i
said
to
him
have
something
amusing
to
show
you
kneel
down
by
this
opening
and
look
at
the
little
acolyte
lean
forward
the
fool
obeyed
he
knelt
his
big
hands
holding
to
the
edge
of
the
trap
and
peered
into
the
darkness
below
i
let
the
door
of
the
trap
fall
it
was
a
square
of
solid
masonry
easy
enough
to
let
fall
but
too
heavy
for
one
man
to
lift
alone
but
he
was
a
trifle
too
quick
for
me
drew
back
his
head
like
a
snake
it
caught
his
hands
he
howled
like
a
dog
i
tore
off
a
fastening
of
the
virgin
robe
and
hid
it
in
his
gown
he
fainted
before
i
had
gone
out
of
the
place
i
had
a
and
a
waiting
droshky
i
packed
away
my
jewels
and
left
moscow
by
the
first
train
i
went
to
paris
traveling
at
speed
with
all
the
art
of
disguise
and
subterfuge
i
could
command
nevertheless
on
my
way
from
the
gare
du
nord
to
the
address
brane
had
given
me
i
thought
that
i
was
being
followed
of
course
i
gave
the
another
number
went
in
at
a
certain
house
i
knew
escaped
by
the
back
and
made
my
way
on
foot
to
brane
apartment
unobserved
they
made
no
difficulty
about
admitting
me
i
found
everything
in
confusion
brane
had
packed
his
boxes
he
was
planning
a
she
laughed
bitterly
i
did
know
it
then
but
in
the
interval
he
met
this
little
american
woman
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
he
was
going
to
give
me
the
slip
i
opened
one
of
his
boxes
wrapped
up
my
booty
in
a
of
his
well
at
the
bottom
and
then
i
hid
myself
i
wanted
to
spy
upon
my
englishman
brane
came
in
locked
up
his
luggage
and
went
out
again
at
once
he
was
in
the
apartments
barely
five
minutes
and
i
never
saw
him
again
the
handsome
devil
i
waited
for
him
to
come
back
presently
some
men
came
in
and
carried
off
the
boxes
i
waited
in
the
apartment
for
several
hours
but
my
lover
did
not
return
he
had
gone
to
america
janice
think
of
it
with
that
treasure
in
his
the
candle
which
had
been
flickering
for
several
minutes
here
went
out
and
she
was
busy
for
a
while
taking
another
from
her
pocket
and
lighting
it
i
wondered
what
time
it
was
surely
long
past
midnight
the
minutes
seemed
to
hurry
through
my
brain
on
wings
of
fear
if
only
she
would
sit
there
talking
talking
telling
me
the
story
of
her
crimes
till
daylight
then
there
might
be
some
faint
hope
for
me
they
would
discover
my
absence
they
would
hunt
i
might
be
able
to
work
the
handkerchief
off
of
my
mouth
and
risk
a
cry
for
help
all
sorts
of
impossible
hopes
kept
darting
painfully
through
my
despair
they
were
infinitely
more
agonizing
than
any
acceptance
of
fate
but
i
was
powerless
to
quiet
them
surely
they
would
search
for
me
surely
they
would
chance
upon
that
hole
in
the
kitchen
closet
surely
god
would
lead
them
to
it
ah
if
only
i
had
told
mary
if
only
my
vanity
had
not
led
me
to
trust
only
in
myself
now
you
know
the
history
of
the
robe
janice
began
the
woman
after
she
had
settled
herself
again
at
my
side
the
treasure
that
has
already
caused
three
deaths
the
acolyte
and
robbie
and
i
ca
go
into
all
the
details
of
my
adventures
after
i
left
apartments
i
soon
found
that
he
had
been
married
and
had
gone
to
america
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
his
address
but
it
was
very
long
a
lifetime
before
i
was
free
to
come
after
my
treasure
other
adventures
intervened
other
people
i
wrote
some
threatening
letters
but
brane
never
answered
them
and
i
was
not
foolish
enough
to
ruin
myself
by
trying
to
ruin
him
i
suppose
he
knew
that
and
felt
safe
in
ignoring
my
attempts
at
blackmail
and
intimidation
well
i
am
triumphant
now
how
that
for
a
moral
tale
what
does
the
bible
say
ungodly
flourish
like
a
green
but
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
how
i
came
to
pines
how
i
managed
to
hide
myself
here
how
i
rid
myself
of
those
three
idiotic
housekeepers
and
brought
you
down
to
take
their
place
how
i
introduced
maida
and
jaffrey
how
i
worked
the
whole
affair
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
but
i
think
there
are
several
things
that
may
surprise
you
now
listen
we
have
still
several
hours
you
shall
have
the
story
you
alone
janice
the
true
story
of
the
pine
cone
mystery
you
are
my
father
confessor
janice
my
secrets
are
as
safe
with
you
as
though
i
whispered
them
into
a
chapter
xvi
the
witch
of
the
wall
had
news
of
brane
death
from
the
very
priest
whose
hands
i
had
mutilated
in
the
door
of
the
trap
the
fellow
had
been
disciplined
unfrocked
driven
from
russia
where
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
make
a
living
and
as
my
method
is
i
had
kept
in
touch
with
him
i
had
even
helped
him
to
make
a
sort
of
fresh
start
oh
by
no
means
an
honorable
one
in
america
and
purposely
i
seen
to
it
that
his
new
activities
should
keep
him
in
the
neighborhood
of
pine
cone
one
who
knows
the
underworld
as
i
do
janice
has
friends
everywhere
has
a
tool
to
her
hand
in
the
remotest
corners
of
the
earth
gast
was
my
spy
on
theodore
brane
gast
and
the
baron
that
nobleman
upon
whom
i
dare
say
you
thought
you
made
such
an
impression
janice
was
at
one
time
theodore
valet
i
knew
him
for
a
thief
in
the
old
days
but
i
kept
him
in
the
household
and
so
completely
in
subjection
that
the
wretch
would
tremble
whenever
he
caught
my
eye
he
too
came
over
to
this
country
and
ostensibly
his
business
became
that
of
a
a
dealer
in
old
furniture
he
had
other
less
reputable
business
on
the
side
at
various
times
brane
bought
furniture
through
him
brane
was
always
ready
to
do
a
kindness
to
his
inferiors
it
was
through
the
baron
that
theodore
got
possession
of
that
bookcase
the
one
with
the
double
back
but
our
wily
did
put
me
wise
to
the
possible
even
after
i
let
him
know
that
brane
had
something
to
hide
till
i
had
bribed
him
for
all
i
was
worth
that
is
he
never
did
put
me
wise
he
blabbed
his
secret
to
you
it
was
only
by
finding
you
on
your
knees
before
the
shelves
the
night
after
that
fool
visit
that
i
guessed
he
given
himself
away
to
my
double
till
then
i
did
realize
how
safe
i
was
in
depending
upon
our
resemblance
pretty
daughter
but
after
that
night
i
amused
myself
greatly
at
your
expense
and
i
admit
janice
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
you
amused
yourself
at
mine
i
had
no
notion
till
that
you
had
dared
to
use
maida
to
question
her
to
force
her
to
write
notes
and
then
to
write
to
gast
to
meet
him
to
get
his
translation
and
to
destroy
it
dieu
you
have
some
courage
some
wit
my
girl
her
tone
of
pride
of
complete
power
set
my
heart
on
fire
with
anger
so
that
for
a
moment
i
even
lost
my
fear
who
found
that
letter
of
gast
under
the
arbor
seat
whoever
it
was
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
you
put
me
into
a
rage
that
was
like
enough
to
drive
me
to
any
sort
of
violence
it
was
the
last
force
of
it
that
you
felt
in
the
woods
that
afternoon
dieu
i
suffered
from
that
anger
to
lie
closed
up
in
the
wall
gnawing
my
own
vitals
helpless
and
to
know
that
you
had
got
the
clue
that
you
would
perhaps
be
making
use
of
it
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
jaffrey
mentioned
in
my
hearing
the
trip
that
you
were
planning
to
pine
cone
i
enjoyed
thrashing
you
janice
and
i
enjoyed
my
little
game
at
your
friend
dabney
expense
but
i
am
going
too
fast
i
must
get
back
to
the
beginning
again
what
are
you
shaking
for
now
scared
no
i
believe
you
she
peered
into
my
burning
face
and
met
the
look
which
must
have
been
a
hateful
one
blazing
in
my
eyes
remember
my
dear
she
said
tauntingly
that
it
behooves
you
to
be
in
charity
with
all
the
indeed
it
was
not
the
least
of
my
torments
on
that
terrible
night
to
know
that
the
last
images
to
possess
my
brain
should
be
such
horrid
ones
of
treachery
and
cruelty
and
murder
sometimes
i
thought
i
would
close
my
eyes
to
her
shut
out
her
presence
from
my
mind
but
the
feat
was
impossible
i
was
too
greatly
fascinated
by
her
smooth
sweet
voice
by
her
vital
presence
by
the
interest
of
her
story
as
i
was
telling
you
she
went
on
it
was
through
father
gast
that
i
heard
of
brane
sudden
death
it
gave
me
the
fright
of
my
life
for
i
thought
he
must
have
told
about
the
treasures
to
his
wife
gast
swore
that
the
englishman
had
the
courage
to
make
use
of
his
trove
any
more
than
he
had
the
courage
to
confess
its
whereabouts
but
i
decided
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
brane
might
have
a
bolder
spirit
i
came
over
to
this
country
disguised
as
a
meek
young
widow
named
gaskell
and
i
rented
a
room
above
the
pine
cone
this
was
last
fall
about
two
months
after
theodore
death
ask
brane
some
time
oh
i
forgot
you
are
not
apt
to
see
her
again
no
doubt
if
you
did
ask
her
she
would
tell
you
about
the
dear
sweet
woman
who
brought
her
little
runaway
robbie
home
one
afternoon
and
took
a
friendly
cup
of
tea
with
her
yes
and
learned
in
about
half
an
hour
only
this
the
silly
little
would
admit
more
about
the
habits
of
her
husband
and
about
her
own
life
and
plans
and
character
than
most
of
the
detectives
i
hoodwinked
could
have
learned
in
a
month
if
it
had
been
for
gaskell
and
for
popularity
with
robbie
nurse
and
for
gaskell
skill
in
winning
robbie
confidence
i
should
never
have
learned
about
that
hole
in
the
kitchen
closet
mary
was
robbie
nurse
in
those
days
oh
no
my
task
would
have
been
so
easy
in
that
case
he
was
being
cared
for
by
a
negro
woman
from
whom
he
ran
away
about
twice
a
week
she
had
a
passion
for
driving
over
to
pine
cone
every
time
george
went
for
supplies
and
she
was
only
too
willing
to
leave
her
charge
with
gaskell
who
did
so
adore
little
children
from
that
girl
i
learned
all
about
the
habits
of
pines
household
and
from
robbie
himself
i
got
the
clue
of
clues
i
understood
that
child
i
could
play
upon
him
as
though
he
had
been
a
little
instrument
of
strings
he
was
the
kind
of
secretive
sensitive
little
animal
that
can
be
opened
up
or
shut
tight
at
will
a
harsh
look
would
scare
him
into
a
a
little
kindness
would
set
him
chattering
i
asked
him
questions
about
the
house
where
his
father
had
worked
and
spent
most
of
his
time
where
he
himself
played
what
especially
were
his
favorite
he
told
me
there
were
lots
of
closets
in
the
house
but
that
he
was
of
dark
closets
and
he
was
scared
of
the
closet
under
the
kitchen
stairs
i
asked
him
why
and
he
told
me
a
long
story
about
going
in
there
and
finding
his
father
bent
over
at
one
end
of
it
one
of
those
garbled
accounts
that
children
give
but
i
gathered
that
his
father
had
been
vexed
at
the
child
intrusion
and
had
told
him
to
keep
out
of
the
kitchen
and
out
of
the
kitchen
closet
it
was
the
faintest
sort
of
clue
a
mere
but
i
decided
to
follow
it
up
one
day
when
i
knew
that
all
the
servants
at
pines
were
off
to
a
county
fair
i
met
with
robbie
and
his
nurse
and
easily
persuaded
the
girl
to
let
me
take
her
charge
back
to
pines
while
she
joined
the
other
robbie
and
i
got
a
lift
and
we
were
dropped
at
pines
gate
i
asked
him
to
take
me
up
to
the
house
by
a
short
cut
and
in
through
the
kitchen
garden
i
told
him
to
pick
me
a
nice
nosegay
of
flowers
and
i
went
in
to
get
a
of
water
the
kitchen
was
empty
and
i
lost
no
time
in
slipping
into
the
small
kitchen
closet
i
saw
at
once
that
it
had
been
purposely
crowded
with
heavy
stuff
and
i
began
to
search
it
of
course
i
found
the
hole
i
even
went
into
the
hollow
wall
here
and
explored
the
whole
passage
dieu
i
was
excited
pleased
i
knew
that
i
was
on
the
track
of
my
treasure
and
i
saw
how
easy
it
would
be
for
some
one
to
hide
in
that
wall
and
live
there
comfortably
enough
for
an
indefinite
time
i
had
what
i
come
for
and
i
decided
that
gaskell
stay
in
pine
cone
would
come
to
an
end
that
night
it
was
disconcerting
to
hear
robbie
voice
calling
gathkell
where
are
you
i
was
still
in
the
passageway
but
i
crawled
through
that
hole
in
a
hurry
too
late
i
met
robbie
face
to
face
he
come
to
find
me
and
was
standing
timidly
in
the
closet
doorway
with
his
hands
full
of
flowers
i
knew
that
i
should
have
to
tie
up
his
tongue
for
good
and
all
i
fixed
him
with
my
eyes
and
let
my
face
change
till
it
must
have
looked
like
the
face
of
the
worst
witch
in
the
worst
old
ever
heard
and
then
still
staring
at
him
i
slowly
lifted
off
my
brown
wig
and
i
drew
up
my
own
red
hair
till
it
almost
touched
the
top
of
the
kitchen
closet
and
i
said
i
the
witch
that
lives
under
the
stairs
i
the
witch
that
lives
under
the
stairs
in
the
worst
voice
i
could
get
out
of
my
throat
a
sort
of
suckling
gobble
it
was
pretty
bad
she
laughed
and
again
my
rage
and
hatred
overwhelmed
my
fear
i
had
to
run
at
him
and
put
my
hand
over
his
mouth
or
he
have
raised
the
roof
with
his
screams
i
got
my
wig
on
again
and
i
carried
him
out
into
the
garden
and
i
told
him
that
if
ever
he
went
near
that
closet
or
even
whispered
to
any
one
that
he
seen
that
woman
i
tell
her
to
come
and
stand
by
his
bed
at
night
and
stick
her
face
down
at
him
till
he
was
all
smothered
by
her
long
red
hair
he
was
all
confused
and
trembling
i
do
know
what
he
thought
he
seemed
to
imagine
that
gaskell
and
the
witch
were
two
distinct
people
but
at
any
rate
he
was
scared
out
of
his
little
wits
and
i
knew
when
i
got
through
with
him
that
wild
horses
would
tear
the
story
of
that
experience
out
of
him
children
are
like
that
you
i
did
know
and
i
lay
there
and
cursed
her
in
my
heart
i
thought
of
what
agonies
the
poor
little
child
had
suffered
in
the
mysterious
silence
of
his
baby
mind
that
pitiful
terrible
silence
of
childhood
that
has
covered
so
many
cruelties
so
much
unspeakable
fear
since
the
childhood
of
the
human
race
began
my
heart
crushed
as
it
was
ached
for
little
robbie
sickened
for
him
i
would
have
given
so
much
to
hold
him
in
my
arms
and
comfort
him
and
reassure
his
little
shaken
soul
god
willing
he
was
happy
now
and
reassured
past
all
the
powers
of
earth
or
hell
to
disturb
his
beautiful
serenity
next
morning
again
i
was
listening
to
the
story
mrs
gaskell
left
pine
cone
to
the
regret
of
all
its
inhabitants
i
doubt
if
ever
there
has
been
a
more
popular
summer
visitor
and
not
many
days
afterwards
a
gypsy
woman
came
to
pines
to
peddle
cheap
jewelry
old
delia
was
in
the
kitchen
and
old
delia
refused
to
take
any
interest
in
the
wares
she
told
the
woman
to
clear
out
but
she
refused
to
go
until
she
had
been
properly
dismissed
by
the
lady
of
the
house
at
last
to
get
rid
of
her
delia
went
off
to
speak
to
her
mistress
and
no
sooner
had
she
closed
the
door
than
the
gypsy
slipped
across
the
kitchen
and
got
herself
into
that
closet
and
the
odd
part
of
it
is
that
she
never
came
out
when
delia
returned
with
more
emphatic
orders
of
dismissal
the
peddling
gypsy
had
gone
nobody
had
seen
her
leave
the
place
but
that
did
not
cause
much
distress
to
any
one
but
brane
i
think
that
she
was
disturbed
at
least
i
know
that
she
ordered
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
and
grounds
for
footsteps
were
running
all
about
everywhere
that
day
and
lights
were
kept
burning
in
the
house
all
night
i
think
perhaps
some
of
the
negroes
sat
up
to
keep
watch
but
the
peddler
made
not
so
much
as
a
squeak
that
night
she
lay
on
a
pile
of
blankets
she
had
carried
in
on
her
back
and
she
ate
a
crust
of
bread
and
an
apple
she
was
sufficiently
comfortable
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
towards
morning
she
went
to
sleep
and
slept
far
into
the
next
day
so
you
see
janice
there
i
was
in
the
house
and
i
was
sure
that
not
far
from
me
was
brane
treasure
trove
this
double
wall
of
which
he
had
evidently
made
use
he
had
built
up
that
queer
flight
of
steps
and
made
a
floor
and
an
inclined
plane
convinced
me
that
i
was
hot
on
the
track
of
the
jewels
you
can
guess
how
i
worked
to
find
them
all
to
no
purpose
i
had
to
be
very
careful
rats
to
be
sure
make
a
noise
in
the
walls
of
old
houses
but
the
noise
is
barely
noticeable
and
it
does
not
sound
like
carpentry
however
i
had
convinced
myself
by
the
end
of
the
third
dreary
day
that
if
the
robe
and
crown
were
hidden
in
the
double
wall
they
were
very
secretly
and
securely
hidden
and
that
i
should
need
some
further
directions
to
find
them
it
was
annoying
especially
as
my
provisions
had
given
out
and
i
knew
that
i
should
have
to
venture
down
into
the
kitchen
at
night
and
pick
up
some
fragments
of
food
i
was
glad
then
and
all
the
time
that
brane
servants
were
such
decrepit
old
bodies
and
and
altogether
stupid
many
the
time
i
crouched
behind
the
junk
in
that
closet
and
listened
to
their
silly
droning
but
it
gave
me
a
sad
jump
when
i
heard
the
voice
of
brane
first
housekeeper
she
was
young
and
nervous
and
had
a
high
breathless
manner
of
talking
and
she
was
bent
upon
efficiency
well
so
was
i
had
decided
that
outside
of
the
wall
there
were
two
rooms
in
the
brane
house
that
must
be
thoroughly
investigated
the
bookroom
where
theodore
kept
his
collection
of
russian
books
and
the
room
upstairs
in
the
north
wing
which
he
had
used
as
a
sort
of
den
and
which
after
his
death
brane
had
converted
into
a
nursery
i
think
she
must
have
had
a
case
of
nerves
after
her
husband
death
for
she
was
set
on
having
a
housekeeper
and
a
new
nurse
for
robbie
and
she
was
always
flitting
about
that
house
like
a
ghost
maybe
after
all
he
had
dropped
her
a
hint
about
some
money
or
jewels
being
hidden
somewhere
in
the
house
that
was
maida
notion
for
she
says
brane
was
as
keen
as
about
cleaning
out
the
old
part
of
the
house
and
never
left
her
alone
an
instant
to
get
back
to
the
first
days
i
spent
in
this
accursed
wall
that
housekeeper
gave
me
a
lot
of
misery
in
the
first
place
she
slept
in
the
north
wing
the
room
you
had
janice
i
was
almost
accustomed
to
this
horrible
past
tense
she
used
towards
me
i
was
beginning
to
think
of
my
own
life
as
a
thing
that
was
over
and
she
was
a
terribly
light
sleeper
twice
as
i
was
sneaking
along
that
passageway
trying
to
locate
the
rooms
she
came
out
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
all
but
saw
me
i
decided
that
my
only
chance
to
really
search
the
place
lay
in
getting
rid
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
northern
wing
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
give
that
part
of
the
house
a
bad
name
once
it
was
empty
i
could
practically
live
there
i
had
reckoned
with
that
of
a
mary
it
was
easy
enough
to
scare
the
housekeeper
i
found
out
just
where
the
wall
of
her
bedroom
stood
and
i
got
close
behind
it
near
her
bed
and
groaned
that
was
quite
enough
two
nights
and
the
miserable
thing
left
brane
got
another
woman
at
once
a
lazy
woman
and
i
wasted
no
time
getting
rid
of
her
i
simply
stole
near
to
her
bed
one
night
and
sighed
she
left
almost
at
once
then
brane
confound
her
sent
to
new
york
to
skane
for
a
detective
and
he
played
for
a
fortnight
i
had
to
keep
as
still
as
a
mouse
i
was
almost
starved
for
i
did
dare
take
enough
food
to
hoard
and
for
a
while
that
detective
prowled
the
house
all
night
i
must
have
come
near
looking
like
a
ghost
in
those
days
thank
god
the
entire
quiet
bored
skane
man
and
reassured
the
rest
of
the
household
when
he
had
gone
i
did
try
for
sometime
i
fed
myself
up
and
did
a
little
down
in
the
bookroom
and
in
some
of
the
empty
bedrooms
with
no
result
then
came
the
third
housekeeper
that
third
housekeeper
my
dear
daughter
all
but
did
for
me
she
was
a
fussy
little
female
with
the
sort
of
energy
that
goes
prying
about
for
unnecessary
pieces
of
labor
and
she
lit
upon
the
kitchen
closet
fortunately
delia
and
the
other
two
women
were
so
annoyed
by
her
methods
that
they
did
take
up
her
instructions
to
clean
out
the
closet
with
any
zeal
so
one
morning
i
heard
her
in
the
kitchen
scolding
and
carrying
on
lazy
women
i
just
have
to
shame
you
by
doing
it
myself
now
while
i
crouched
there
listening
to
her
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
heard
her
voice
before
i
racked
my
frightened
brains
i
had
never
seen
the
woman
but
i
was
certain
that
the
voice
a
peculiar
one
belonged
somewhere
in
my
memory
i
decided
there
might
be
some
useful
association
i
risked
coming
into
the
closet
and
taking
a
look
then
i
fled
back
and
laughed
to
myself
i
had
known
that
little
when
she
was
a
very
great
somebody
maid
and
i
knew
enough
about
her
to
send
her
to
the
chair
was
it
luck
i
went
back
into
my
hole
for
all
the
world
like
a
spider
and
sat
there
waiting
for
my
prey
she
did
a
lot
of
clattering
around
in
the
closet
then
i
knew
by
the
silence
that
she
lit
upon
the
hole
i
crept
near
and
waited
for
her
crouched
in
the
dark
she
came
crawling
through
the
hole
i
can
see
her
silly
pale
face
now
i
pounced
upon
her
with
all
the
swiftness
and
the
silence
of
a
tarantula
i
stopped
her
mouth
before
she
could
squeal
and
i
carried
her
back
to
the
end
of
the
passage
here
and
i
talked
to
her
for
about
five
seconds
at
the
end
of
that
time
every
bone
in
her
body
had
turned
to
water
she
had
sworn
as
though
to
god
to
hold
her
tongue
and
to
get
out
of
the
house
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
forever
and
ever
amen
and
i
let
her
go
she
scuttled
out
of
the
closet
like
a
rat
and
i
heard
her
tell
delia
to
leave
the
place
alone
the
third
housekeeper
left
the
next
day
and
as
i
heard
by
listening
to
kitchen
gossip
she
gave
no
reason
for
her
going
but
of
course
i
had
had
a
terrible
experience
myself
i
was
going
to
risk
anything
like
that
again
besides
i
was
sick
of
living
in
the
wall
i
got
out
that
night
half
the
time
delia
forgot
to
lock
the
outside
door
and
always
blamed
her
own
carelessness
when
she
found
it
open
in
the
morning
i
had
decent
clothes
with
me
and
i
tramped
to
a
station
at
some
distance
and
went
up
to
new
york
i
decided
to
take
a
few
of
my
pals
in
on
the
game
i
had
several
old
pals
in
new
york
and
some
introductions
it
a
city
for
crooks
almost
as
good
as
london
and
not
half
so
well
policed
and
there
my
girl
i
took
the
trouble
of
hunting
you
up
it
was
because
i
meant
to
use
you
at
pines
it
was
just
out
of
curiosity
motherly
love
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
drawling
irony
of
the
expression
on
her
lips
you
are
one
of
the
people
i
kept
track
of
i
always
felt
you
might
be
useful
that
i
might
be
able
to
frighten
you
into
usefulness
many
the
time
i
seen
you
when
you
were
a
child
and
later
when
you
were
working
in
paris
not
much
more
than
a
child
then
but
such
a
slim
little
beauty
what
was
it
the
work
oh
yes
you
were
a
little
assistant
milliner
and
you
turned
down
the
chance
of
being
monsieur
le
baron
and
lost
your
job
for
the
reward
of
virtue
little
fool
i
knew
you
had
gone
to
america
but
i
had
lost
track
of
your
whereabouts
i
soon
picked
up
your
tracks
though
and
found
out
that
you
were
in
new
york
looking
for
work
your
beauty
has
been
against
you
janice
it
always
against
moral
and
correct
living
it
a
great
help
in
going
to
the
devil
and
beating
him
at
his
own
game
however
as
you
might
discover
if
i
were
immoral
enough
to
let
you
live
the
instant
i
set
eyes
on
you
in
new
york
and
saw
what
a
ridiculous
copy
of
your
mother
you
had
grown
to
be
i
felt
that
here
was
an
opportunity
of
some
sort
if
i
could
only
make
use
of
it
i
racked
my
brains
and
as
usual
the
inspiration
came
i
got
brane
advertisement
so
far
unanswered
and
i
handed
it
to
you
myself
in
the
street
as
soon
as
i
was
sure
that
you
had
got
the
job
i
left
for
pines
i
slipped
in
like
a
thief
at
night
one
of
the
nights
when
delia
forgot
to
lock
the
back
door
i
had
shadowed
you
pretty
closely
those
days
between
the
time
you
answered
the
advertisement
and
left
for
pines
and
it
was
a
difficult
matter
for
me
to
get
a
copy
of
your
wardrobe
you
do
know
what
a
help
it
was
to
me
that
you
chose
a
sort
of
uniform
i
knew
that
you
be
wearing
one
of
those
four
gray
dresses
most
of
the
time
after
you
were
in
the
house
i
grew
pretty
bold
and
it
was
then
i
decided
to
get
robbie
out
of
that
nursery
so
i
made
myself
up
as
the
witch
that
lives
under
the
stairs
and
waked
him
by
bending
down
over
his
bed
with
my
hair
hanging
in
his
face
i
was
nearly
caught
at
it
too
by
mary
and
i
scared
the
old
women
out
of
the
house
which
i
had
in
the
least
intended
to
do
i
did
half
like
brane
plan
of
getting
a
man
and
wife
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
women
and
i
saw
at
once
the
necessity
for
jaffrey
and
maida
however
i
was
determined
not
to
let
them
know
that
there
were
two
women
in
the
house
i
was
fascinated
by
this
plan
of
using
you
janice
of
getting
witnesses
to
swear
to
your
identity
as
madame
trème
of
baiting
a
trap
with
you
for
bait
into
which
all
of
my
accomplices
would
tumble
as
they
have
tumbled
and
then
as
a
last
stroke
putting
an
end
to
you
and
making
a
clean
myself
if
any
one
swings
for
your
murder
it
will
be
maida
who
left
pines
so
hurriedly
and
secretly
there
another
reason
why
i
did
take
them
into
the
secret
of
your
resemblance
i
was
glad
to
have
them
fancy
themselves
always
under
my
eye
the
risk
of
their
giving
themselves
away
to
you
was
very
small
for
i
had
arranged
a
signal
without
which
they
were
positively
forbidden
to
show
by
sign
or
look
or
word
even
when
they
seemed
to
be
alone
with
me
that
they
had
any
collusion
with
brane
housekeeper
that
they
thought
her
anything
in
the
world
but
brane
housekeeper
i
have
my
tools
pretty
well
scared
janice
and
i
knew
they
would
obey
my
orders
to
the
in
this
madame
was
wrong
maida
and
jaffrey
had
both
disobeyed
this
order
with
no
signal
from
me
they
had
spoken
in
their
own
character
to
me
as
though
i
had
indeed
been
madame
trème
like
the
plans
of
most
generals
madame
plans
had
their
weak
points
you
know
how
it
all
worked
she
went
on
unconscious
of
my
mental
connotations
and
then
nom
de
dieu
came
god
how
the
rats
scuttled
in
the
house
the
night
after
he
came
i
had
maida
to
thank
for
putting
me
wise
that
slim
youngster
with
his
air
of
punishment
i
admit
he
have
given
me
very
little
uneasiness
you
see
as
she
talked
i
had
been
watching
her
with
the
fixity
of
my
despair
but
a
few
moments
before
this
last
speech
of
hers
concerning
dabney
the
flickering
of
the
light
across
her
face
had
drawn
my
attention
to
the
second
candle
it
had
burned
for
more
than
half
its
length
and
i
knew
that
morning
was
at
hand
morning
and
a
faint
hope
the
story
was
not
finished
and
though
i
thought
i
could
tell
the
rest
myself
the
woman
was
so
absorbed
in
the
delightful
contemplation
of
her
triumph
and
her
cleverness
that
i
knew
she
would
go
on
to
the
end
the
wild
resurgent
hope
deafened
me
for
a
few
minutes
to
her
low
murmur
of
narration
it
had
come
to
me
like
a
flash
that
with
my
legs
unbound
i
might
be
able
to
knock
over
the
candle
put
it
out
get
to
my
feet
in
one
lightning
spring
and
make
a
dash
for
the
hole
in
the
closet
would
there
not
be
a
chance
of
my
reaching
it
alive
would
not
the
noise
of
my
flight
in
spite
of
my
stocking
feet
and
the
handkerchief
over
my
mouth
be
enough
to
attract
the
attention
even
of
a
sleeping
house
much
more
certainly
of
an
awakened
and
suspicious
one
it
was
of
course
a
desperate
hope
but
i
could
not
help
but
entertain
it
if
i
could
force
myself
to
wait
till
morning
had
surely
come
till
there
was
the
stir
and
murmur
of
awakening
life
surely
oh
dear
god
surely
there
might
be
one
little
hope
of
life
i
was
young
and
strong
and
active
i
must
not
die
here
in
this
horrible
wall
i
must
not
bear
the
infamy
of
this
woman
guilt
i
must
not
lie
dead
and
unspeakably
defiled
in
the
sight
of
the
man
i
loved
paul
dabney
face
haggard
wistful
appeared
before
me
and
my
whole
heart
cried
out
to
its
gray
and
doubting
eyes
for
help
for
pity
for
belief
unluckily
the
woman
sensitive
as
a
cat
had
become
aware
of
the
changed
current
of
my
thought
of
the
changed
direction
of
my
look
she
too
glanced
at
the
candle
and
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
dismay
that
stabbed
the
silence
like
a
suddenly
bared
knife
bah
she
said
it
must
be
daylight
and
i
have
half
confessed
myself
pests
on
the
time
we
been
here
four
or
five
hours
are
you
cramped
i
was
insufferably
cramped
the
pain
of
my
arms
and
shoulders
the
cutting
of
the
twine
about
my
wrists
were
torment
i
was
very
thirsty
too
but
nothing
was
so
cruel
as
the
sinking
of
my
heart
which
her
words
caused
me
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
cut
it
short
she
said
after
all
you
must
know
it
almost
as
well
as
i
do
especially
since
you
had
the
nerve
to
play
my
part
with
maida
the
worst
trick
you
put
over
on
me
was
when
you
pulled
dabney
out
of
the
mud
curse
the
mud
anyway
if
it
had
been
a
real
quicksand
he
have
been
done
for
but
his
getting
back
alive
that
night
certainly
crossed
me
and
as
for
maida
she
was
in
a
rage
she
could
understand
how
he
escaped
she
cursed
and
raved
and
threatened
even
me
it
was
all
that
jaffrey
and
i
could
do
to
hold
her
she
was
for
giving
up
the
whole
game
and
making
a
getaway
before
it
was
too
late
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
already
too
late
for
any
one
but
me
hovey
had
you
all
just
where
he
wanted
you
at
any
instant
he
could
bag
you
all
i
had
known
that
for
some
time
if
it
had
been
for
your
janice
and
a
little
bit
perhaps
because
of
my
own
pretty
ways
all
of
you
would
be
jailed
by
now
after
you
rescued
your
dabney
i
had
to
play
a
bold
prompt
game
i
knew
that
the
spell
could
hold
much
longer
i
could
see
by
the
strained
look
on
that
boy
face
that
he
was
at
the
snapping
point
i
told
maida
to
search
the
bookcase
that
night
action
of
some
kind
was
necessary
to
keep
her
in
hand
i
did
know
that
you
had
already
taken
away
the
paper
gast
had
told
me
about
the
paper
when
i
was
in
new
york
and
the
baron
had
hinted
at
its
possible
he
came
down
here
that
day
to
tell
me
bribed
him
for
all
i
was
worth
he
was
going
to
leave
word
with
maida
then
of
course
he
saw
you
and
the
poor
fool
thought
i
was
playing
housekeeper
under
very
nose
the
night
after
dabney
rescue
after
you
saved
his
life
at
the
risk
of
your
own
i
whistled
him
into
the
arbor
under
your
window
and
kissed
him
for
you
were
your
maiden
dreams
disturbed
no
no
my
girl
try
to
get
your
hands
free
for
in
my
anger
at
her
words
i
had
begun
to
wrench
at
my
bonds
you
just
cut
your
wrists
to
the
bone
eh
did
i
tell
you
i
felt
the
blood
run
down
my
hands
and
stopped
gasping
with
pain
she
went
on
as
coolly
as
before
i
found
out
that
night
when
maida
came
to
me
in
the
wall
with
her
bad
news
that
got
ahead
of
us
i
was
so
much
scared
as
i
might
have
been
for
i
knew
that
brane
had
had
his
directions
translated
into
the
slavonic
tongue
i
suppose
the
poor
cracked
fool
did
it
to
protect
his
treasure
from
accidental
discovery
he
was
crazed
by
having
all
that
money
in
his
possession
and
not
being
bold
enough
to
use
it
all
his
actions
prove
that
his
mind
was
quite
unbalanced
he
just
spun
a
fantastic
web
of
mystery
about
the
hidden
stuff
because
he
had
the
nerve
to
do
anything
else
i
imagine
he
meant
to
tell
his
wife
but
he
died
suddenly
of
paralysis
and
was
able
to
do
so
he
hired
a
priest
to
help
him
with
the
paper
and
gast
shadowing
my
former
lover
and
knowing
that
he
had
the
robe
and
crown
managed
to
find
out
what
he
been
doing
gast
did
get
the
substance
of
the
paper
but
he
learned
from
the
priest
that
an
eccentric
englishman
writing
a
story
of
adventure
had
asked
him
to
translate
a
paragraph
into
old
russian
gast
handed
on
this
information
to
me
and
promised
to
translate
the
paragraph
when
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
it
janice
when
i
found
out
that
i
been
fool
enough
to
lose
letter
which
he
sent
to
me
through
maida
and
by
losing
it
had
put
the
means
of
getting
a
translation
into
your
hands
i
gnawed
my
fingers
i
was
half
mad
then
when
you
made
your
first
trip
to
pine
cone
and
dabney
had
you
shadowed
so
closely
that
i
could
follow
you
myself
i
knew
that
you
were
sending
gast
a
letter
i
was
sure
you
dare
to
meet
him
though
i
thought
you
might
risk
sending
him
the
paper
i
risked
my
own
life
by
bribing
george
to
leave
you
in
pine
cone
to
foot
it
home
alone
and
i
risked
it
again
by
following
you
and
laying
that
trap
for
you
in
the
woods
i
risked
it
because
i
was
certain
that
you
would
have
the
translation
hidden
in
your
dress
i
pushed
the
pine
tree
over
after
george
had
passed
it
needed
only
a
push
de
dieu
you
can
not
know
what
frenzy
seized
me
when
i
found
out
that
again
you
had
outwitted
me
i
wanted
to
kill
you
that
day
i
wanted
to
beat
you
to
death
there
and
leave
you
dead
but
you
were
a
little
too
valuable
i
decided
to
cripple
you
to
put
you
out
of
running
for
a
few
days
while
i
got
hold
of
the
fool
priest
myself
that
was
only
yesterday
but
it
seems
an
age
you
must
be
made
of
iron
janice
you
came
near
defeating
me
the
insolence
of
it
you
a
chit
of
a
girl
this
morning
i
gave
maida
a
letter
for
gast
and
i
thought
it
was
to
mail
it
that
she
went
out
after
supper
when
i
found
her
note
under
my
plate
i
had
a
shock
i
was
sure
she
had
found
out
something
important
i
went
down
to
the
bridge
yes
you
may
have
the
satisfaction
make
the
most
of
it
i
did
go
down
to
the
bridge
but
i
did
wait
long
ten
minutes
was
enough
do
you
suppose
maida
would
be
late
for
an
appointment
with
me
not
if
she
was
living
no
my
girl
i
stood
there
and
realized
that
you
might
have
worked
the
trick
that
you
might
have
sent
maida
out
of
the
way
might
have
decoyed
me
might
even
at
that
instant
be
on
the
track
of
my
jewels
god
how
i
ran
back
to
the
house
when
i
found
the
kitchen
door
locked
i
went
round
to
the
front
door
and
rang
the
bell
i
was
going
to
lose
time
snooping
around
for
unfastened
windows
not
with
dabney
in
the
house
i
suppose
he
was
sleeping
sound
because
he
too
thought
you
were
safely
laid
by
the
heels
jaffrey
answered
the
bell
and
looked
surprised
confound
him
i
gave
him
some
excuse
and
went
like
the
wind
up
to
your
room
sure
enough
it
was
empty
i
waited
till
jaffrey
had
got
back
to
his
bed
and
then
i
hurried
down
to
the
kitchen
you
know
the
rest
you
know
it
all
now
to
the
end
but
you
do
quite
know
the
chapter
xviii
the
last
victim
had
listened
to
all
this
as
though
to
voices
in
a
fever
i
had
been
trying
to
get
up
my
courage
for
a
leap
it
seemed
to
me
now
a
desperate
hopeless
undertaking
but
it
was
easier
to
die
in
a
struggle
than
to
lie
there
in
cold
blood
while
she
strangled
me
with
those
long
cold
iron
hands
she
was
not
calm
i
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
shifting
her
arms
and
legs
twitched
her
fingers
moved
restlessly
black
and
hard
as
her
lost
soul
must
be
it
shrank
a
little
from
this
killing
the
murder
of
her
own
child
gave
her
a
very
ague
of
dread
it
was
partly
no
doubt
the
desire
to
postpone
the
hideous
act
that
had
kept
her
spinning
out
her
tale
so
long
but
the
end
had
come
now
it
was
i
knew
it
well
the
last
moment
of
my
life
i
looked
at
the
candle
at
the
same
instant
i
heard
a
window
open
somewhere
in
the
house
thank
god
it
was
morning
the
household
was
awake
the
sound
was
all
i
needed
to
fire
my
courage
i
flung
myself
bodily
upon
the
candle
rolled
away
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
fled
along
the
passageway
with
the
speed
of
my
despair
she
was
after
me
like
a
flash
but
i
had
an
instant
start
down
the
inclined
plane
i
slid
i
leapt
along
the
steps
and
there
at
the
foot
she
fell
upon
me
and
we
lay
panting
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
closet
wall
and
i
realized
that
our
flight
had
been
no
more
noisy
than
the
scuttling
of
rats
i
gave
myself
up
to
death
madame
took
me
up
in
her
arms
as
though
i
had
been
a
little
child
and
as
a
panther
carried
me
back
to
the
side
of
the
iron
box
there
she
laid
me
down
and
bound
my
ankles
not
gently
so
that
the
blood
flowed
under
the
twine
then
with
steady
hands
she
relighted
the
candle
i
saw
her
face
livid
with
rage
and
fear
pitiless
glaring
she
slid
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
dress
that
gray
dress
which
she
had
copied
from
mine
again
for
a
fantastic
icy
second
i
had
that
awful
feeling
that
she
was
i
that
i
was
she
that
we
were
of
the
same
spirit
and
flesh
when
her
hand
came
out
it
held
a
slender
knife
fine
and
keen
and
delicate
as
a
surgical
instrument
with
her
other
hand
she
sought
and
found
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
now
knew
the
manner
of
my
death
i
shut
my
eyes
and
prayed
that
it
would
be
over
quickly
there
was
the
faintest
sound
above
my
head
and
i
opened
my
eyes
before
the
woman
saw
my
deliverance
i
saw
it
a
beam
that
had
made
part
of
the
sill
that
crossed
the
passageway
above
us
slid
quietly
from
its
place
and
into
the
opening
a
figure
swung
and
dropped
before
even
it
could
reach
the
ground
the
woman
had
put
out
the
light
and
vanished
like
a
ghost
i
heard
not
so
much
as
the
rustle
of
her
dress
the
figure
from
above
landed
lightly
beside
me
and
flashed
on
an
electric
lantern
it
was
paul
dabney
he
bent
over
me
and
drew
a
quick
sharp
breath
i
tried
to
cry
out
follow
the
woman
but
my
bound
lips
moved
soundlessly
i
have
caught
you
he
said
dully
it
is
the
for
me
it
was
indeed
the
end
a
far
more
bitter
one
than
a
knife
in
my
heart
i
should
be
taken
i
should
be
tried
for
my
life
half
a
dozen
people
would
swear
that
i
was
madame
trème
who
would
believe
my
incredible
story
i
was
lost
i
looked
up
at
paul
dabney
with
complete
despair
footsteps
came
along
the
inclined
plane
but
dabney
did
not
turn
around
evidently
he
expected
them
and
they
did
not
interest
him
he
was
shaking
even
his
white
lips
were
unsteady
i
saw
his
hands
open
and
shut
the
light
of
the
electric
lantern
and
the
light
that
fell
through
the
trapdoor
which
he
had
so
mysteriously
opened
above
our
heads
made
him
ghastly
visible
made
the
whole
passageway
with
its
rafters
and
its
red
bricks
outlined
with
plaster
the
iron
box
the
glimmer
of
jewels
plain
to
my
sight
i
saw
two
men
coming
towards
me
between
them
by
her
arms
they
held
up
madame
trème
we
got
her
sir
said
one
of
them
triumphantly
i
recognized
brane
outdoors
men
and
thought
confusedly
that
one
of
these
was
hovey
the
detective
paul
dabney
looked
slowly
around
he
looked
and
raised
a
shaking
hand
to
his
eyes
he
turned
again
towards
me
then
as
though
a
current
of
life
had
been
flashed
through
his
veins
he
sprang
to
my
side
untied
my
bonds
tore
off
the
silk
handkerchief
from
my
mouth
i
was
as
helpless
as
a
babe
but
he
lifted
me
tenderly
and
kneeling
supported
me
in
his
arms
janice
he
said
brokenly
janice
what
does
it
mean
my
double
laughed
so
now
hovey
you
cat
do
you
understand
what
a
fool
my
pretty
daughter
and
i
have
made
of
you
you
think
yourself
very
clever
no
doubt
your
reputation
is
made
is
it
now
that
nabbed
the
famous
madame
of
the
strand
no
no
my
friend
not
quite
so
she
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
struggling
with
her
captors
i
saw
her
bend
her
mouth
to
her
shoulder
bite
and
tear
at
her
dress
we
all
looked
at
her
in
a
ghastly
sort
of
silence
i
could
feel
paul
quivering
muscles
and
his
quick
breathing
then
for
a
second
i
saw
a
white
pellet
on
the
woman
tongue
it
must
have
been
sewed
into
the
seam
of
her
dress
there
at
the
shoulder
she
swallowed
convulsively
and
stood
still
her
head
thrust
forward
staring
in
front
of
her
with
eyes
like
stones
my
face
must
have
showed
itself
to
her
through
the
mists
of
death
for
she
spoke
once
hoarsely
the
girl
is
quite
innocent
she
said
she
was
trying
for
the
jewels
do
you
get
that
hovey
keep
your
claws
off
then
she
gave
a
great
shiver
her
face
turned
blue
her
head
dropped
forward
her
legs
gave
way
and
the
two
men
held
a
dead
body
in
their
arms
chapter
xix
skane
cleverest
man
the
death
of
madame
trème
and
the
arrest
of
jaffrey
and
of
maida
the
danger
to
the
pines
was
over
it
was
a
long
time
however
before
i
was
allowed
to
tell
my
story
i
lay
in
a
darkened
room
waited
upon
by
mary
and
the
least
sound
or
word
would
send
me
into
a
paroxysm
of
hysterical
tears
the
first
person
to
whom
i
recounted
my
adventures
was
the
detective
hovey
a
certain
and
demure
young
man
whom
i
had
long
known
by
another
name
our
interview
was
very
formal
i
called
him
hovey
and
met
his
cool
and
unembarrassed
look
as
rarely
as
i
could
i
was
propped
up
in
bed
to
make
my
statement
haverstock
was
present
his
hand
often
stealing
to
my
pulse
and
mary
stood
near
with
a
stimulant
she
had
made
me
as
pretty
as
she
could
the
dear
soul
had
arranged
my
hair
and
chosen
my
dainty
but
i
must
have
looked
like
a
ghost
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
lay
a
brand
of
shame
across
my
face
hovey
took
down
my
statement
and
haverstock
witnessed
it
i
was
told
that
i
should
have
to
appear
in
court
at
the
trial
of
accomplices
at
that
i
shrank
and
looked
helplessly
at
haverstock
and
my
eyes
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
filled
with
tears
oh
my
dear
said
the
doctor
kindly
it
will
be
a
long
time
yet
you
will
be
strong
enough
to
face
there
are
some
things
i
murmured
shakily
that
i
shall
never
be
able
to
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hands
and
turned
against
the
pillow
i
heard
haverstock
whisper
something
and
i
knew
that
hovey
and
he
had
left
the
room
paul
had
not
said
a
word
to
me
except
the
necessary
questions
his
face
had
been
expressionless
and
pale
what
else
could
i
expect
how
could
any
man
act
otherwise
to
the
daughter
of
the
famous
madame
trème
the
doctor
mary
brane
were
all
wonderfully
kind
i
broke
down
again
under
brane
kindness
oh
janice
my
poor
child
she
said
to
me
when
i
was
at
last
allowed
to
see
her
why
did
you
come
to
me
why
did
you
try
to
bear
all
this
terror
and
misery
yourself
i
held
her
hand
i
wish
i
come
to
you
dear
brane
i
wish
for
very
many
reasons
that
i
had
had
the
humility
and
good
sense
to
do
so
what
now
is
there
except
that
statement
of
my
wretched
mother
to
keep
you
the
whole
world
every
one
from
thinking
that
i
was
a
thief
myself
from
putting
that
construction
upon
my
insane
behavior
here
well
janice
she
said
indulgently
there
is
one
person
to
prevent
it
i
for
one
would
never
have
the
courage
to
suggest
such
a
theory
in
paul
hovey
presence
he
has
written
up
your
rescue
of
him
so
movingly
and
told
the
story
of
it
so
appealingly
that
i
think
you
are
rather
in
danger
of
being
a
sort
of
national
heroine
in
the
papers
my
dear
you
are
painted
in
the
most
glowing
colors
i
should
wonder
if
there
would
be
a
movie
written
about
paul
i
said
paul
has
told
it
yes
paul
and
i
think
he
owes
you
an
in
fact
we
all
do
i
engaged
a
detective
the
day
after
delia
and
jane
and
annie
left
and
very
well
i
knew
of
course
that
our
young
student
visitor
was
cleverest
man
but
i
did
not
guess
that
from
the
first
moment
he
suspected
you
poor
child
poor
janice
what
misery
you
have
been
through
all
by
your
brave
desolate
little
self
from
the
first
moment
i
repeated
blankly
from
the
first
moment
paul
thought
that
i
was
madame
trème
my
mind
ran
back
over
that
meeting
in
the
bookroom
i
remembered
his
sharp
sudden
speeches
the
slight
edge
to
his
voice
i
had
thought
him
a
coward
with
that
hand
in
his
pocket
and
he
meanwhile
had
imagined
himself
always
under
the
eyes
of
the
strand
yes
said
brane
one
of
the
force
saw
you
get
off
the
train
at
pine
cone
and
was
struck
by
your
resemblance
to
the
famous
i
remembered
the
man
whose
scrutiny
had
so
annoyed
me
he
reported
at
headquarters
madame
possible
presence
and
they
realized
at
once
that
if
she
was
in
it
the
pine
cone
case
was
apt
to
be
both
dangerous
and
interesting
there
was
big
game
somewhere
so
without
telling
me
how
serious
the
situation
might
be
they
chose
hovey
and
sent
him
down
here
as
a
student
of
russian
literature
they
knew
that
madame
had
never
come
in
contact
with
him
paul
hovey
has
rather
a
remarkable
history
janice
would
you
care
to
hear
it
i
bent
my
head
he
began
life
as
a
young
man
with
great
expectations
and
a
social
position
but
he
was
very
careless
in
his
choice
of
companions
it
was
the
love
of
adventure
i
suppose
like
harry
hotspur
and
his
crew
at
a
not
a
very
reputable
one
i
am
afraid
on
long
island
this
was
a
good
many
years
ago
he
got
mixed
up
in
a
very
tangled
web
and
disentangled
himself
with
such
cleverness
and
resource
discovering
the
guilty
man
before
the
police
had
even
sniffed
a
trail
that
skane
half
as
a
joke
urged
him
to
turn
detective
hovey
too
treated
it
as
a
joke
but
not
long
after
my
dear
the
poor
boy
got
himself
into
trouble
oh
nothing
wicked
it
was
a
matter
of
holding
his
tongue
and
keeping
other
people
safe
or
telling
the
truth
and
clearing
himself
of
rather
discreditable
folly
he
held
his
tongue
and
most
people
believed
his
innocence
i
think
every
one
would
have
stood
by
him
for
he
was
enormously
popular
if
the
very
people
from
whom
he
had
the
best
right
to
expect
mercy
and
loyalty
had
not
turned
against
him
his
uncle
who
had
brought
him
up
and
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
engaged
he
was
disinherited
and
turned
out
of
doors
and
the
girl
a
worldly
little
wretch
promptly
threw
him
over
hovey
went
straight
to
skane
who
welcomed
him
like
a
child
since
then
paul
hovey
has
become
famous
in
his
chosen
line
of
work
now
you
know
his
history
i
learned
it
what
was
not
already
public
property
from
a
man
a
friend
of
paul
dead
father
a
man
who
loves
paul
dearly
and
has
known
him
all
his
i
was
not
sorry
selfish
as
the
feeling
was
to
learn
that
paul
too
had
a
grievance
against
the
world
that
he
too
was
something
of
a
waif
and
stray
another
bit
of
fate
flotsam
like
myself
and
from
the
first
moment
he
thought
i
was
madame
trème
yes
and
fell
in
love
with
you
a
nice
situation
for
a
detective
was
it
do
start
you
know
he
did
but
i
must
run
away
before
i
tell
you
any
more
secrets
i
must
leave
paul
hovey
to
make
his
own
apologies
to
plead
his
own
cause
i
am
tiring
you
as
it
is
you
are
getting
much
too
i
will
never
give
hovey
a
chance
to
make
his
apologies
i
said
sadly
and
i
am
certain
dear
brane
that
he
will
never
try
for
the
chance
who
would
who
would
want
to
to
love
the
daughter
of
it
was
here
that
i
broke
down
and
she
comforted
me
janice
darling
she
said
when
i
was
a
little
quieter
love
is
a
very
mighty
god
and
though
they
say
he
is
blind
i
believe
that
he
sees
like
an
immortal
if
paul
hovey
loved
you
in
spite
of
his
best
will
and
judgment
against
every
instinct
of
loved
you
to
his
own
shame
and
anguish
when
he
thought
you
a
woman
dyed
in
crime
a
woman
who
had
attempted
his
life
do
you
think
he
will
stop
loving
you
when
he
knows
your
history
and
your
innocence
she
left
me
before
i
could
answer
her
question
but
she
left
me
without
a
ray
of
hope
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
never
marry
any
one
and
i
was
sure
with
the
memory
of
paul
cold
questioning
looks
in
our
recent
interview
that
he
would
never
come
to
me
again
but
he
did
come
we
met
in
the
sunny
bookroom
where
i
had
first
led
him
so
long
it
seemed
very
long
ago
i
was
sitting
in
the
window
seat
trying
listlessly
to
read
and
listening
heartbrokenly
to
the
gay
music
of
a
in
the
tree
outside
when
his
step
sounded
in
the
hall
and
while
i
stood
half
risen
to
fly
he
came
in
quietly
and
stood
before
me
with
his
boyish
and
disarming
smile
my
knees
gave
way
and
i
dropped
back
into
my
place
the
book
falling
to
the
floor
i
was
trembling
all
over
do
say
you
wo
let
me
talk
to
you
janice
he
pleaded
and
his
face
was
white
with
earnestness
do
try
to
run
away
from
me
you
must
in
all
fairness
hear
me
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
listen
to
i
stammered
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
perhaps
it
is
nothing
to
listen
to
he
said
but
it
is
the
most
important
thing
to
me
in
the
world
it
means
my
life
that
to
talk
to
me
yes
for
god
sake
let
us
play
no
tricks
with
each
other
now
there
has
been
too
much
disguise
between
us
i
mistook
you
for
a
wicked
woman
yes
but
you
knew
that
i
mistook
you
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
better
than
my
own
soul
you
knew
that
i
suffered
damnably
and
you
did
not
undeceive
me
i
kept
a
policeman
guard
upon
you
yes
i
let
you
find
the
paper
i
let
you
get
the
translation
and
when
i
could
force
my
heart
to
give
in
to
my
sense
of
duty
i
tracked
you
down
and
found
you
with
the
treasure
i
saw
your
double
go
out
through
the
that
night
and
i
thought
as
i
had
thought
from
the
beginning
that
she
was
you
i
followed
her
to
the
bridge
i
followed
her
back
to
the
house
i
let
her
go
into
her
and
i
set
two
men
to
watch
that
entrance
while
i
went
out
to
make
sure
of
maida
and
jaffrey
long
before
that
night
i
had
discovered
the
other
opening
to
the
passage
the
opening
in
robbie
window
sill
had
fastened
it
up
so
that
none
of
the
gang
should
light
upon
it
when
i
came
back
at
my
leisure
thinking
to
find
my
quarry
in
the
hands
of
my
two
men
they
told
me
that
she
had
not
come
out
that
they
had
waited
according
to
orders
and
had
heard
a
long
murmur
of
voices
in
the
wall
then
i
betook
myself
to
the
other
opening
and
dropped
on
you
from
here
all
at
once
his
broke
down
he
came
and
took
my
hands
drawing
them
up
against
his
heart
so
that
i
rose
slowly
to
my
feet
in
front
of
him
do
you
know
what
it
was
like
to
me
to
feel
that
i
was
handing
you
over
to
justice
even
then
i
loved
you
even
then
your
beauty
and
your
eyes
oh
janice
i
ca
think
of
the
agony
of
it
all
do
make
me
go
over
it
do
make
me
explain
it
in
cold
blood
in
cold
blood
there
is
a
drop
of
cold
blood
in
my
body
when
i
hold
your
hands
are
you
going
to
forgive
me
are
you
going
to
let
me
begin
again
may
i
have
my
chance
i
laughed
bitterly
enough
your
chance
to
win
the
daughter
of
madame
trème
at
that
he
gripped
me
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
till
in
the
tumult
of
my
heart
i
could
not
hear
the
music
of
the
my
heart
has
always
known
you
for
the
lovely
and
holy
thing
you
are
he
told
me
later
it
knew
you
in
spite
of
my
bewildered
did
it
know
me
that
night
in
the
arbor
i
asked
him
shakily
and
he
was
silent
i
had
to
forgive
him
because
he
made
no
attempt
to
defend
himself
he
sat
there
miserable
and
silent
letting
my
hand
go
till
i
gave
it
back
to
him
of
my
own

a
little

and
the
blackest
hair
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
the
treasure
the
robe
and
crown

so
bedazzled
the
weak

of

and
which
drew
madame
across
the
ocean
to
her
death

again
in
the

where
there

glittering
