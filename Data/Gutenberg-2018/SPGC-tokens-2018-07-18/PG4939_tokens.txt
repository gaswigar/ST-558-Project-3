to

that
in
their

chopin
violence
was
psychic
a
travailing
and
groaning
of
the
spirit
the
bright
roughness
of
adventure
was
missing
from
his
quotidian
existence
the
tragedy
was
within
one
recalls
maurice
maeterlinck
whereas
most
of
our
life
is
passed
far
from
blood
cries
and
swords
and
the
tears
of
men
have
become
silent
invisible
and
almost
spiritual
chopin
went
from
poland
to
france
from
warsaw
to
paris
where
finally
he
was
borne
to
his
grave
in
pere
la
chaise
he
lived
loved
and
died
and
not
for
him
were
the
perils
prizes
and
fascinations
of
a
hero
career
he
fought
his
battles
within
the
walls
of
his
soul
we
may
note
and
enjoy
them
in
his
music
his
outward
state
was
not
niggardly
of
incident
though
his
inner
life
was
richer
nourished
as
it
was
in
the
silence
and
the
profound
unrest
of
a
being
that
irritably
resented
every
intrusion
there
were
events
that
left
ineradicable
impressions
upon
his
nature
upon
his
work
his
early
love
his
sorrow
at
parting
from
parents
and
home
the
shock
of
the
warsaw
revolt
his
passion
for
george
sand
the
death
of
his
father
and
of
his
friend
matuszynski
and
the
rupture
with
madame
sand
these
were
crises
of
his
history
all
else
was
but
an
indeterminate
factor
in
the
scheme
of
his
earthly
sojourn
chopin
though
not
an
anchorite
resembled
flaubert
being
both
proud
and
timid
he
led
a
detached
life
hence
his
art
was
bold
and
violent
unlike
liszt
he
seldom
sought
the
glamor
of
the
theatre
and
was
never
in
such
public
view
as
his
maternal
admirer
sand
he
was
frederic
francois
chopin
composer
teacher
of
piano
and
a
lyric
genius
of
the
highest
range
recently
the
date
of
his
birth
has
been
again
discussed
by
natalie
janotha
the
polish
pianist
chopin
was
born
in
six
miles
from
warsaw
march
this
place
is
sometimes
spelled
the
medallion
made
for
the
tomb
by
clesinger
the
of
george
sand
and
the
watch
given
by
the
singer
catalan
in
with
the
inscription
donne
par
madame
catalan
a
frederic
chopin
age
de
dix
ans
have
incited
a
conflict
of
authorities
karasowski
was
informed
by
chopin
sister
that
the
correct
year
of
his
birth
was
and
szulc
sowinski
and
niecks
agree
with
him
szulc
asserts
that
the
memorial
in
the
holy
cross
church
warsaw
where
chopin
heart
is
preserved
bears
the
date
march
chopin
so
henry
finck
declares
was
years
of
age
when
he
wrote
to
his
teacher
elsner
in
liszt
told
niecks
in
that
karasowski
had
published
the
correct
date
in
his
biography
now
let
us
consider
janotha
arguments
according
to
her
evidence
the
composer
natal
day
was
february
and
his
christening
occurred
april
of
the
same
year
the
following
baptismal
certificate
originally
in
latin
and
translated
by
finck
is
adduced
it
is
said
to
be
from
the
church
in
which
chopin
was
christened
i
the
above
have
performed
the
ceremony
of
baptizing
in
water
a
boy
with
the
double
name
frederic
francois
on
the
day
of
february
son
of
the
musicians
nicolai
choppen
a
frenchman
and
justina
de
krzyzanowska
his
legal
spouse
the
musicians
franciscus
grembeki
and
donna
anna
skarbekowa
countess
of
the
wrong
date
was
chiselled
upon
the
monument
unveiled
october
at
chopin
birthplace
erected
practically
through
the
efforts
of
milia
balakireff
the
russian
composer
janotha
whose
father
founded
the
warsaw
conservatory
informed
finck
that
the
later
date
has
also
been
put
on
other
monuments
in
poland
now
chopin
father
was
not
a
musician
neither
was
his
mother
i
can
not
trace
grembeki
but
we
know
that
the
countess
skarbek
mother
of
chopin
namesake
was
not
a
musician
however
the
title
musician
in
the
baptismal
certificate
may
have
signified
something
eulogistic
at
that
time
besides
the
polish
clergy
was
not
a
particularly
accurate
class
but
janotha
has
more
testimony
in
her
controversy
with
me
in
she
quoted
father
bielawski
the
present
cure
of
brochow
parish
church
of
this
reverend
person
consulted
records
and
gave
as
his
opinion
that
is
authentic
nevertheless
the
biography
of
wojcicki
and
the
statement
of
the
chopin
family
contradict
him
and
so
the
case
stands
janotha
continues
firm
in
her
belief
although
authorities
do
not
justify
her
position
all
this
petty
pother
arose
since
niecks
comprehensive
biography
appeared
so
sure
was
he
of
his
facts
that
he
disposed
of
the
in
one
footnote
perhaps
the
composer
was
to
blame
artists
male
as
well
as
female
have
been
known
to
make
themselves
younger
in
years
by
conveniently
forgetting
their
birthdate
or
by
attributing
the
error
to
carelessness
in
the
registry
of
dates
surely
the
chopin
family
could
not
have
been
mistaken
in
such
an
important
matter
regarding
chopin
ancestry
there
is
still
a
moiety
of
doubt
his
father
was
born
august
the
same
year
as
beethoven
at
nancy
lorraine
some
claim
that
he
had
polish
blood
in
his
veins
szulc
claims
that
he
was
the
natural
son
of
a
polish
nobleman
who
followed
king
stanislas
leszcinski
to
lorraine
dropping
the
szopen
or
szop
for
the
more
gallic
chopin
when
frederic
went
to
paris
he
in
turn
changed
the
name
from
szopen
to
chopin
which
is
common
in
france
chopin
father
emigrated
to
warsaw
in
enticed
by
the
offer
of
a
compatriot
there
in
the
tobacco
business
and
was
the
traditional
frenchman
of
his
time
agreeable
and
more
than
usually
cultivated
he
joined
the
national
guard
during
the
kosciuszko
revolution
in
when
business
stagnated
he
was
forced
to
teach
in
the
family
of
the
leszynskis
mary
of
that
name
one
of
his
pupils
being
beloved
by
napoleon
became
the
mother
of
count
walewski
a
minister
of
the
second
french
empire
drifting
to
nicholas
chopin
lived
in
the
house
of
the
countess
skarbek
acting
as
tutor
to
her
son
frederic
there
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
justina
krzyzanowska
born
of
poor
but
noble
parents
he
married
her
in
and
she
bore
him
four
children
three
girls
and
the
boy
frederic
francois
with
a
refined
scholarly
french
father
polish
in
political
sentiments
and
an
admirable
polish
mother
patriotic
to
the
extreme
frederic
grew
to
be
an
intelligent
vivacious
lad
never
a
hearty
boy
but
never
very
delicate
he
seemed
to
escape
most
of
the
disagreeable
ills
of
childhood
the
moonstruck
pale
sentimental
calf
of
many
biographers
he
never
was
strong
evidence
exists
that
he
was
merry
and
fond
of
practical
jokes
while
his
father
was
never
rich
the
family
after
the
removal
to
warsaw
lived
at
ease
the
country
was
prosperous
and
chopin
the
elder
became
a
professor
in
the
warsaw
lyceum
his
children
were
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
charming
simplicity
love
and
refinement
the
mother
was
an
ideal
mother
and
as
george
sand
declared
chopin
only
love
but
as
we
shall
discover
later
lelia
was
ever
jealous
jealous
even
of
past
his
sisters
were
gifted
gentle
and
disposed
to
pet
him
niecks
has
killed
all
the
pretty
fairy
tales
of
his
poverty
and
suffering
strong
common
sense
ruled
the
actions
of
chopin
parents
and
when
his
love
for
music
revealed
itself
at
an
early
age
they
engaged
a
teacher
named
adalbert
zwyny
a
bohemian
who
played
the
violin
and
taught
piano
julius
fontana
one
of
the
first
friends
of
the
boy
he
committed
suicide
in
paris
december
says
that
at
the
age
of
twelve
chopin
knew
so
much
that
he
was
left
to
himself
with
the
usual
good
and
ill
results
he
first
played
on
february
a
concerto
by
gyrowetz
and
was
so
pleased
with
his
new
collar
that
he
naively
told
his
mother
everybody
was
looking
at
my
collar
his
musical
precocity
not
as
marked
as
mozart
but
phenomenal
withal
brought
him
into
intimacy
with
the
polish
aristocracy
and
there
his
taste
for
fashionable
society
developed
the
czartoryskis
radziwills
skarbeks
potockis
lubeckis
and
the
grand
duke
constantine
with
his
princess
lowicka
made
life
pleasant
for
the
talented
boy
then
came
his
lessons
with
joseph
elsner
in
composition
lessons
of
great
value
elsner
saw
the
material
he
had
to
mould
and
so
deftly
did
he
teach
that
his
pupil
individuality
was
never
checked
never
warped
for
elsner
chopin
entertained
love
and
reverence
to
him
he
wrote
from
paris
asking
his
advice
in
the
matter
of
studying
with
kalkbrenner
and
this
advice
he
took
seriously
from
zwyny
and
elsner
even
the
greatest
ass
must
learn
something
he
is
quoted
as
having
said
then
there
are
the
usual
anecdotes
one
is
tempted
to
call
them
the
stock
stories
of
the
boyhood
of
any
great
composer
in
infancy
chopin
could
not
hear
music
without
crying
mozart
was
morbidly
sensitive
to
the
tones
of
a
trumpet
later
the
polish
lad
sported
familiarly
with
his
talents
for
he
is
related
to
have
sent
to
sleep
and
awakened
a
party
of
unruly
boys
at
his
father
school
another
story
is
his
fooling
of
a
jew
merchant
he
had
high
spirits
perhaps
too
high
for
his
slender
physique
he
was
a
facile
mimic
and
liszt
balzac
bocage
sand
and
others
believed
that
he
would
have
made
an
actor
of
ability
with
his
sister
emilia
he
wrote
a
little
comedy
altogether
he
was
a
clever
if
not
a
brilliant
lad
his
letters
show
that
he
was
not
the
latter
for
while
they
are
lively
they
do
not
reveal
much
literary
ability
but
their
writer
saw
with
open
eyes
eyes
that
were
disposed
to
caricature
the
peculiarities
of
others
this
trait
much
clarified
and
spiritualized
in
later
life
became
a
distinct
ironic
note
in
his
character
possibly
it
attracted
heine
although
his
irony
was
on
a
more
intellectual
plane
his
piano
playing
at
this
time
was
neat
and
finished
and
he
had
already
begun
those
experimentings
in
technique
and
tone
that
afterward
revolutionized
the
world
of
music
and
the
keyboard
he
being
sickly
and
his
sister
health
poor
the
pair
was
sent
in
to
reinerz
a
watering
place
in
prussian
silesia
this
with
a
visit
to
his
godmother
a
titled
lady
named
wiesiolowska
and
a
sister
of
count
frederic
skarbek
the
name
does
not
tally
with
the
one
given
heretofore
as
noted
by
janotha
consumed
this
year
in
he
left
his
regular
studies
at
the
lyceum
and
devoted
his
time
to
music
he
was
much
in
the
country
listening
to
the
fiddling
and
singing
of
the
peasants
thus
laying
the
corner
stone
of
his
art
as
a
national
composer
in
the
fall
of
he
went
to
berlin
and
this
trip
gave
him
a
foretaste
of
the
outer
world
stephen
heller
who
saw
chopin
in
described
him
as
pale
of
delicate
health
and
not
destined
so
they
said
in
warsaw
for
a
long
life
this
must
have
been
during
one
of
his
depressed
periods
for
his
stay
in
berlin
gives
a
record
of
unclouded
spirits
however
his
sister
emilia
died
young
of
pulmonary
trouble
and
doubtless
frederic
was
predisposed
to
lung
complaint
he
was
constantly
admonished
by
his
relatives
to
keep
his
coat
closed
perhaps
as
in
wagner
case
the
uncontrollable
gayety
and
hectic
humors
were
but
so
many
signs
of
a
fatal
disintegrating
process
wagner
outlived
them
until
the
scriptural
age
but
chopin
succumbed
when
grief
disappointment
and
intense
feeling
had
undermined
him
for
the
dissipations
of
the
average
sensual
man
he
had
an
abiding
contempt
he
never
smoked
in
fact
disliked
it
his
friend
sand
differed
greatly
in
this
respect
and
one
of
the
saddest
anecdotes
related
by
de
lenz
accuses
her
of
calling
for
a
match
to
light
her
cigar
frederic
un
fidibus
she
commanded
and
frederic
obeyed
philip
hale
mentions
a
letter
from
balzac
to
his
countess
hanska
dated
march
which
concludes
george
sand
did
not
leave
paris
last
year
she
lives
at
rue
pigalle
no
chopin
is
always
there
elle
ne
fume
que
des
cigarettes
et
pas
autre
chose
hale
states
that
the
italics
are
in
the
letter
so
much
for
de
lenz
and
his
fidibus
i
am
impelled
here
to
quote
from
mr
earnest
newman
study
of
wagner
because
chopin
exaltation
of
spirits
alternating
with
irritability
and
intense
depression
were
duplicated
in
wagner
newman
writes
of
wagner
there
have
been
few
men
in
whom
the
torch
of
life
has
burned
so
fiercely
in
his
early
days
he
seems
to
have
had
that
gayety
of
temperament
and
that
apparently
boundless
energy
which
men
in
his
case
as
in
that
of
heine
nietzsche
amiel
and
others
have
wrongly
assumed
to
be
the
outcome
of
harmonious
physical
and
mental
health
there
is
a
pathetic
exception
in
the
outward
lives
of
so
many
men
of
genius
the
bloom
being
to
the
instructed
eye
only
the
indication
of
some
subtle
nervous
derangement
only
the
forerunner
of
decay
the
overmastering
cerebral
agitation
that
obsessed
wagner
life
was
as
with
chopin
a
symptom
not
a
sickness
but
in
the
latter
it
had
not
yet
assumed
a
sinister
turn
chopin
fourteen
days
in
berlin
he
went
there
under
the
protection
of
his
father
friend
professor
jarocki
to
attend
the
great
scientific
congress
were
full
of
joy
unrestrained
the
pair
left
warsaw
september
and
after
five
days
travel
in
a
diligence
arrived
at
berlin
this
was
a
period
of
leisure
travelling
and
living
frederic
saw
spontini
mendelssohn
and
zelter
at
a
distance
and
heard
freischutz
he
attended
the
congress
and
made
sport
of
the
scientists
alexander
von
humboldt
included
on
the
way
home
they
stopped
at
a
place
called
zullichau
and
chopin
improvised
on
polish
airs
so
charmingly
that
the
stage
was
delayed
all
hands
turning
in
to
listen
this
is
another
of
the
anecdotes
of
honorable
antiquity
count
tarnowski
relates
that
chopin
left
warsaw
with
a
light
heart
with
a
mind
full
of
ideas
perhaps
full
of
dreams
of
fame
and
happiness
have
only
twenty
kreuzers

in

it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
richer
than
arthur
potocki
whom
i
met
only
a
moment
ago
besides
this
witty
conceptions

showing

it

to
me

sikorski

a
story
of
the
lad
improvising
in

so
that
the

the

a
few
days
in

where
the
prince
radziwill

despite
what
liszt

did
not
contribute
a
penny
to
the
youth

of

major

muzyczne
niecks
writes
that
he
never
saw
a
copy
of
this
rare
composition
paderewski
tells
me
he
has
the
piece
and
that
it
is
weak
having
historic
interest
only
i
can
not
find
much
about
the
polish
poet
julius
slowacki
who
died
the
same
year
as
edgar
allan
poe
tarnowski
declares
him
to
have
been
chopin
warmest
friend
and
in
his
poetry
a
starting
point
of
inspiration
for
the
composer
in
july
accompanied
by
two
friends
chopin
started
for
vienna
travelling
in
a
delightful
manner
the
party
saw
much
of
the
country
galicia
upper
silesia
and
moravia
the
polish
switzerland
on
july
they
arrived
in
the
austrian
capital
then
chopin
first
began
to
enjoy
an
artistic
atmosphere
to
live
less
parochially
his
home
life
sweet
and
tranquil
as
it
was
could
not
fail
to
hurt
him
as
artist
he
was
flattered
and
coddled
and
doubtless
the
touch
of
effeminacy
in
his
person
was
fostered
in
vienna
the
life
was
gayer
freer
and
infinitely
more
artistic
than
in
warsaw
he
met
every
one
worth
knowing
in
the
artistic
world
and
his
letters
at
that
period
are
positively
brimming
over
with
gossip
and
pen
pictures
of
the
people
he
knew
the
little
drop
of
malice
he
injects
into
his
descriptions
of
the
personages
he
encounters
is
harmless
enough
and
proves
that
the
young
man
had
considerable
wit
count
gallenberg
the
lessee
of
the
famous
karnthnerthor
theatre
was
kind
to
him
and
the
publisher
haslinger
treated
him
politely
he
had
brought
with
him
his
variations
on
la
ci
darem
la
mano
altogether
the
times
seemed
propitious
and
much
more
so
when
he
was
urged
to
give
a
concert
persuaded
to
overcome
a
natural
timidity
he
made
his
vienna
debut
at
this
theatre
august
playing
on
a
stein
piano
his
variations
opus
his
krakowiak
rondo
had
been
announced
but
the
parts
were
not
legible
so
instead
he
improvised
he
had
success
being
recalled
and
his
improvisation
on
the
polish
tune
called
chmiel
and
a
theme
from
la
dame
blanche
stirred
up
much
enthusiasm
in
which
a
grumbling
orchestra
joined
the
press
was
favorable
though
chopin
playing
was
considered
rather
light
in
weight
his
style
was
admired
and
voted
original
here
the
critics
could
see
through
the
millstone
while
a
lady
remarked
it
a
pity
his
appearance
is
so
insignificant
this
reached
the
composer
ear
and
caused
him
an
evil
quarter
of
an
hour
for
he
was
morbidly
sensitive
but
being
like
most
poles
secretive
managed
to
hide
it
august
encouraged
by
his
triumph
chopin
gave
a
second
concert
on
the
same
stage
this
time
he
played
the
krakowiak
and
his
talent
for
composition
was
discussed
by
the
newspapers
he
plays
very
quietly
without
the
daring
elan
which
distinguishes
the
artist
from
the
amateur
said
one
his
defect
is
the
of
the
indication
of
accent
at
the
beginning
of
musical
phrases
what
was
then
admired
in
vienna
was
explosive
accentuations
and
piano
drumming
the
article
continues
as
in
his
playing
he
was
like
a
beautiful
young
tree
that
stands
free
and
full
of
fragrant
blossoms
and
ripening
fruits
so
he
manifested
as
much
estimable
individuality
in
his
compositions
where
new
figures
and
passages
new
forms
unfolded
themselves
this
rather
acute
critique
translated
by
niecks
is
from
the
wiener
theaterzeitung
of
august
the
writer
of
it
can
not
be
accused
of
misoneism
that
hardening
of
the
faculties
of
curiousness
and
prophecy
that
of
the
organs
of
hearing
which
afflicts
critics
of
music
so
early
in
life
and
evokes
rancor
and
dislike
to
novelties
chopin
derived
no
money
from
either
of
his
concerts
by
this
time
he
was
accustomed
to
being
reminded
of
the
lightness
and
exquisite
delicacy
of
his
touch
and
the
originality
of
his
style
it
elated
him
to
be
no
longer
mistaken
for
a
pupil
and
he
writes
home
that
my
manner
of
playing
pleases
the
ladies
so
very
much
this
manner
never
lost
its
hold
over
female
hearts
and
the
airs
caprices
and
little
struttings
of
frederic
are
to
blame
for
the
widely
circulated
legend
of
his
effeminate
ways
the
legend
soon
absorbed
his
music
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
this
fiction
begotten
of
half
fact
and
half
mental
indolence
has
taken
root
like
the
noxious
weed
it
is
when
rubinstein
tausig
and
liszt
played
chopin
in
passional
phrases
the
public
and
critics
were
aghast
this
was
a
transformed
chopin
indeed
a
chopin
transposed
to
the
key
of
manliness
yet
it
is
the
true
chopin
the
young
man
manners
were
a
trifle
feminine
but
his
brain
was
masculine
electric
and
his
soul
courageous
his
polonaises
ballades
scherzi
and
etudes
need
a
mighty
grip
a
grip
mental
and
physical
chopin
met
czerny
he
is
a
good
man
but
nothing
more
he
said
of
him
czerny
admired
the
young
pianist
with
the
elastic
hand
and
on
his
second
visit
to
vienna
characteristically
inquired
are
you
still
industrious
czerny
brain
was
a
tireless
incubator
of
piano
exercises
while
chopin
so
fused
the
technical
problem
with
the
poetic
idea
that
such
a
nature
as
the
old
pedagogue
must
have
been
unattractive
to
him
he
knew
franz
lachner
and
other
celebrities
and
seems
to
have
enjoyed
a
mild
flirtation
with
leopoldine
blahetka
a
popular
young
pianist
for
he
wrote
of
his
sorrow
at
parting
from
her
on
august
he
left
with
friends
for
bohemia
arriving
at
prague
two
days
later
there
he
saw
everything
and
met
klengel
of
canon
fame
a
still
greater
than
the
redoubtable
jadassohn
of
leipzig
chopin
and
klengel
liked
each
other
three
days
later
the
party
proceeded
to
teplitz
and
chopin
played
in
aristocratic
company
he
reached
dresden
august
heard
spohr
faust
and
met
capellmeister
morlacchi
that
same
morlacchi
whom
wagner
succeeded
as
a
conductor
january
vide
finck
wagner
by
september
after
a
brief
sojourn
in
breslau
chopin
was
again
safe
at
home
in
warsaw
about
this
time
he
fell
in
love
with
constantia
gladowska
a
singer
and
pupil
of
the
warsaw
conservatory
niecks
dwells
gingerly
upon
his
fervor
in
love
and
friendship
a
passion
with
him
and
thinks
that
it
gives
the
key
to
his
life
of
his
romantic
friendship
for
titus
woyciechowski
and
john
matuszynski
his
johnnie
there
are
abundant
evidences
in
the
letters
they
are
like
the
letters
of
a
maiden
but
chopin
purity
of
character
was
marked
he
shrank
from
coarseness
of
all
sorts
and
the
fates
only
know
what
he
must
have
suffered
at
times
from
george
sand
and
her
gallant
band
of
retainers
to
this
impressionable
man
parisian
badinage
not
to
call
it
anything
stronger
was
positively
antipathetical
of
him
we
might
indeed
say
in
lafcadio
hearn
words
every
mortal
man
has
been
many
million
times
a
woman
and
was
it
the
goncourts
who
dared
to
assert
that
there
are
no
women
of
genius
women
of
genius
are
men
chopin
needed
an
outlet
for
his
sentimentalism
his
piano
was
but
a
sieve
for
some
and
we
are
rather
amused
than
otherwise
on
reading
the
romantic
nonsense
of
his
boyish
letters
after
the
vienna
trip
his
spirits
and
his
health
flagged
he
was
overwrought
and
warsaw
became
hateful
to
him
for
he
loved
but
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
it
to
the
beloved
one
he
put
it
on
paper
he
played
it
but
speak
it
he
could
not
here
is
a
point
that
reveals
chopin
native
indecision
his
inability
to
make
up
his
mind
he
recalls
to
me
the
frederic
moreau
of
flaubert
sentimentale
there
is
an
atrophy
of
the
will
for
chopin
can
neither
propose
nor
fly
from
warsaw
he
writes
letters
that
are
full
of
letters
that
must
have
both
bored
and
irritated
his
friends
like
many
other
men
of
genius
he
suffered
all
his
life
from
folie
de
doute
indeed
his
was
what
specialists
call
a
beautiful
case
this
halting
and
irresolution
was
a
stumbling
block
in
his
career
and
is
faithfully
mirrored
in
his
art
chopin
went
to
posen
in
october
and
at
the
radziwills
was
attracted
by
the
beauty
and
talent
of
the
princess
elisa
who
died
young
george
sand
has
noted
chopin
emotional
versatility
in
the
matter
of
falling
in
and
out
of
love
he
could
accomplish
both
of
an
evening
and
a
crumpled
roseleaf
was
sufficient
cause
to
induce
frowns
and
capricious
flights
decidedly
a
young
man
tres
difficile
he
played
at
the
ressource
in
november
the
variations
opus
on
march
he
gave
his
first
concert
in
warsaw
and
selected
the
adagio
and
rondo
of
his
first
concerto
the
one
in
f
minor
and
the
potpourri
on
polish
airs
his
playing
was
criticised
for
being
too
delicate
an
old
complaint
but
the
musicians
elsner
kurpinski
and
the
rest
were
pleased
edouard
wolff
said
they
had
no
idea
in
warsaw
of
the
real
greatness
of
chopin
he
was
polish
this
the
public
appreciated
but
of
chopin
the
individual
they
missed
entirely
the
flavor
a
week
later
spurred
by
adverse
and
favorable
criticism
he
gave
a
second
concert
playing
the
same
excerpts
from
this
concerto
the
slow
movement
is
constance
gladowska
musically
idealized
the
krakowiak
and
an
improvisation
the
affair
was
a
success
from
these
concerts
he
cleared
six
hundred
dollars
not
a
small
sum
in
those
days
for
an
unknown
virtuoso
a
sonnet
was
printed
in
his
honor
champagne
was
offered
him
by
an
enthusiastic
paris
bred
but
not
born
pianist
named
dunst
who
for
this
act
will
live
in
all
chronicles
of
piano
playing
worse
still
orlowski
served
up
the
themes
of
his
concerto
into
mazurkas
and
had
the
impudence
to
publish
them
then
came
the
last
blow
he
was
asked
by
a
music
seller
for
his
portrait
which
he
refused
having
no
desire
he
said
with
a
shiver
to
see
his
face
on
cheese
and
butter
wrappers
some
of
the
criticisms
were
glowing
others
absurd
as
criticisms
occasionally
are
chopin
wrote
to
titus
the
same
rhapsodical
protestations
and
finally
declared
in
meticulous
peevishness
i
will
no
longer
read
what
people
write
about
me
this
has
the
familiar
ring
of
the
true
artist
who
cares
nothing
for
the
newspapers
but
reads
them
religiously
after
his
own
and
his
rivals
concerts
chopin
heard
henrietta
sontag
with
great
joy
he
was
ever
a
lover
and
a
connoisseur
of
singing
he
advised
young
pianists
to
listen
carefully
and
often
to
great
singers
mdlle
de
belleville
the
pianist
and
lipinski
the
violinist
were
admired
and
he
could
write
a
sound
criticism
when
he
chose
but
the
gladowska
is
worrying
him
unbearable
longing
is
driving
him
to
exile
he
attends
her
debut
as
agnese
in
paer
opera
of
that
title
and
writes
a
complete
description
of
the
important
function
to
titus
who
is
at
his
country
seat
where
chopin
visits
him
betimes
agitated
he
thinks
of
going
to
berlin
or
vienna
but
after
much
philandering
remains
in
warsaw
on
october
following
many
preparations
and
much
emotional
chopin
gave
his
third
and
last
warsaw
concert
he
played
the
e
minor
concerto
for
the
first
time
in
public
but
not
in
sequence
the
first
and
last
two
movements
were
separated
by
an
aria
such
being
the
custom
of
those
days
later
he
gave
the
fantasia
on
polish
airs
best
of
all
for
him
miss
gladowska
sang
a
rossini
air
wore
a
white
dress
and
roses
in
her
hair
and
was
charmingly
beautiful
thus
chopin
and
the
details
have
all
the
relevancy
of
a
male
besieged
by
dan
cupid
chopin
must
have
played
well
he
said
so
himself
and
he
was
always
a
cautious
despite
his
pride
his
vanity
and
girlishness
peep
out
in
his
recital
by
the
response
to
a
quartet
of
recalls
i
believe
i
did
it
yesterday
with
a
certain
grace
for
brandt
had
taught
me
how
to
do
it
properly
he
is
not
speaking
of
his
poetic
performance
but
of
his
bow
to
the
public
as
he
formerly
spoke
to
his
mother
of
his
pretty
collar
so
as
young
man
he
makes
much
of
his
deportment
but
it
is
all
quite
in
the
role
scratch
an
artist
and
you
surprise
a
child
of
course
constantia
sang
wonderfully
her
low
b
came
out
so
magnificently
that
zielinski
declared
it
alone
was
worth
a
thousand
ducats
ah
these
enamored
ones
chopin
left
warsaw
november
for
vienna
and
without
declaring
his
love
or
was
he
a
rejected
suitor
history
is
dumb
he
never
saw
his
gladowska
again
for
he
did
not
return
to
warsaw
the
lady
was
married
in
preferring
a
solid
certainty
to
nebulous
genius
to
joseph
grabowski
a
merchant
at
warsaw
her
husband
so
saith
a
romantic
biographer
count
wodzinski
became
blind
perhaps
even
a
blind
country
gentleman
was
preferable
to
a
lachrymose
pianist
chopin
must
have
heard
of
the
attachment
in
her
name
almost
disappears
from
his
correspondence
time
as
well
as
other
nails
drove
from
his
memory
her
image
if
she
was
fickle
he
was
inconstant
and
so
let
us
waste
no
pity
on
this
episode
over
which
lakes
of
tears
have
been
shed
and
rivers
of
ink
have
been
spilt
chopin
was
accompanied
by
elsner
and
a
party
of
friends
as
far
as
wola
a
short
distance
from
warsaw
there
the
pupils
of
the
conservatory
sang
a
cantata
by
elsner
and
after
a
banquet
he
was
given
a
silver
goblet
filled
with
polish
earth
being
adjured
so
karasowski
relates
never
to
forget
his
country
or
his
friends
wherever
he
might
wander
chopin
his
heart
full
of
sorrow
left
home
parents
friends
and
ideal
severed
with
his
youth
and
went
forth
in
the
world
with
the
keyboard
and
a
brain
full
of
beautiful
music
as
his
only
weapons
at
kaliz
he
was
joined
by
the
faithful
titus
and
the
two
went
to
breslau
where
they
spent
four
days
going
to
the
theatre
and
listening
to
music
chopin
played
quite
impromptu
two
movements
of
his
e
minor
concerto
supplanting
a
tremulous
amateur
in
dresden
where
they
arrived
november
they
enjoyed
themselves
with
music
chopin
went
to
a
soiree
at
kreyssig
and
was
overwhelmed
at
the
sight
of
a
circle
of
dames
armed
with
knitting
needles
which
they
used
during
the
intervals
of
in
the
most
formidable
manner
he
heard
auber
and
rossini
operas
and
rolla
the
italian
violinist
and
listened
with
delight
to
dotzauer
and
kummer
the
violoncellists
the
cello
being
an
instrument
for
which
he
had
a
consuming
affection
rubini
the
brother
of
the
great
tenor
he
met
and
was
promised
important
letters
of
introduction
if
he
desired
to
visit
italy
he
saw
klengel
again
who
told
the
young
pole
thereby
pleasing
him
very
much
that
his
playing
was
like
john
field
prague
was
also
visited
and
he
arrived
at
vienna
in
november
there
he
confidently
expected
a
repetition
of
his
former
successes
but
was
disappointed
haslinger
received
him
coldly
and
refused
to
print
his
variations
or
concerto
unless
he
got
them
for
nothing
chopin
first
brush
with
the
hated
tribe
of
publishers
begins
here
and
he
adopts
as
his
motto
the
pleasing
device
pay
thou
animal
a
motto
he
strictly
adhered
to
in
money
matters
chopin
was
very
particular
the
bulk
of
his
extant
correspondence
is
devoted
to
the
exposure
of
the
ways
and
wiles
of
music
publishers
animal
is
the
mildest
term
he
applies
to
them
jew
the
most
frequent
objurgation
after
all
chopin
was
very
polish
he
missed
his
friends
the
blahetkas
who
had
gone
to
stuttgart
and
altogether
did
not
find
things
so
promising
as
formerly
no
profitable
engagements
could
be
secured
and
to
cap
his
misery
titus
his
other
self
left
him
to
join
the
revolutionists
in
poland
november
his
letters
reflect
his
mental
agitation
and
terror
over
his
safety
a
thousand
times
he
thought
of
renouncing
his
artistic
ambitions
and
rushing
to
poland
to
fight
for
his
country
he
never
did
and
his
indecision
it
was
not
cowardice
is
our
gain
chopin
put
his
patriotism
his
wrath
and
his
heroism
into
his
polonaises
that
is
why
we
have
them
now
instead
of
chopin
having
been
the
target
of
some
russian
chopin
was
psychically
brave
let
us
not
cavil
at
the
almost
miraculous
delicacy
of
his
organization
he
wrote
letters
to
his
parents
and
to
matuszyriski
but
they
are
not
despairing
at
least
not
to
the
former
he
pretended
gayety
and
had
great
hopes
for
the
future
for
he
was
living
entirely
on
means
supplied
him
by
his
father
news
of
constantia
gladdened
him
and
he
decided
to
go
to
italy
but
the
revolution
early
in
decided
him
for
france
malfatti
was
good
to
him
and
cheered
him
and
he
managed
to
accomplish
much
social
visiting
the
letters
of
this
period
are
most
interesting
he
heard
sarah
heinefetter
sing
and
listened
to
thaiberg
playing
of
a
movement
of
his
own
concerto
thalberg
was
three
years
younger
than
chopin
and
already
famous
chopin
did
not
admire
him
thalberg
plays
famously
but
he
is
not
my
man
he
plays
forte
and
piano
with
the
pedals
but
not
with
the
hand
takes
tenths
as
easily
as
i
do
octaves
and
wears
studs
with
diamonds
thalberg
was
not
only
too
much
of
a
technician
for
chopin
but
he
was
also
a
jew
and
a
successful
one
in
consequence
both
poet
and
pole
revolted
hummel
called
on
frederic
but
we
hear
nothing
of
his
opinion
of
the
elder
man
and
his
music
this
is
all
the
more
strange
considering
how
much
chopin
built
on
hummel
style
perhaps
that
is
the
cause
of
the
silence
just
as
wagner
dislike
for
meyerbeer
was
the
result
of
his
obligations
to
the
composer
of
les
huguenots
he
heard
aloys
schmitt
play
and
uttered
the
very
heinesque
witticism
that
he
is
already
over
forty
years
old
and
composes
eighty
years
old
music
this
in
a
letter
to
elsner
our
chopin
could
be
amazingly
sarcastic
on
occasion
he
knew
slavik
the
violin
virtuoso
merk
the
and
all
the
music
publishers
at
a
concert
given
by
madame
in
april
he
appeared
and
in
june
gave
a
concert
of
his
own
at
which
he
must
have
played
the
e
minor
concerto
because
of
a
passing
mention
in
a
musical
paper
he
studied
much
and
it
was
july
before
he
left
vienna
after
a
second
last
and
thoroughly
discouraging
visit
chopin
got
a
passport
vised
for
london
passant
par
paris
londres
and
had
permission
from
the
russian
ambassador
to
go
as
far
as
munich
then
the
cholera
gave
him
some
bother
as
he
had
to
secure
a
clean
bill
of
health
but
he
finally
got
away
the
romantic
story
of
i
am
only
passing
through
paris
which
he
is
reported
to
have
said
in
after
years
has
been
ruthlessly
shorn
of
its
sentiment
at
munich
he
played
his
second
concerto
and
pleased
greatly
but
he
did
not
remain
in
the
bavarian
capital
hastening
to
stuttgart
where
he
heard
of
the
capture
of
warsaw
by
the
russians
september
this
news
it
is
said
was
the
genesis
of
the
great
c
minor
etude
in
opus
sometimes
called
the
revolutionary
chopin
exclaimed
in
a
letter
dated
december
all
this
caused
me
much
pain
who
could
have
foreseen
it
and
in
another
letter
he
wrote
how
glad
my
mamma
will
be
that
i
did
not
go
back
count
tarnowski
in
his
recollections
prints
some
extracts
from
a
diary
said
to
have
been
kept
by
chopin
according
to
this
his
agitation
must
have
been
terrible
here
are
several
examples
my
poor
father
my
dearest
ones
perhaps
they
hunger
maybe
he
has
not
anything
to
buy
bread
for
mother
perhaps
my
sisters
have
fallen
victims
to
the
fury
of
the
muscovite
soldiers
oh
father
is
this
the
consolation
of
your
old
age
mother
poor
suffering
mother
is
it
for
this
you
outlived
your
daughter
and
i
here
unoccupied
and
i
am
here
with
empty
hands
sometimes
i
groan
suffer
and
despair
at
the
piano
o
god
move
the
earth
that
it
may
swallow
the
humanity
of
this
century
may
the
most
cruel
fortune
fall
upon
the
french
that
they
did
not
come
to
our
aid
all
this
sounds
a
trifle
melodramatic
and
quite
unlike
chopin
he
did
not
go
to
warsaw
but
started
for
france
at
the
end
of
september
arriving
early
in
october
poland
downfall
had
aroused
him
from
his
apathy
even
if
it
sent
him
further
from
her
this
journey
as
liszt
declares
settled
his
fate
chopin
was
years
old
when
he
reached
paris
ii
paris
in
the
maelstrom
here
according
to
niecks
is
the
itinerary
of
chopin
life
for
the
next
eighteen
years
in
paris
boulevard
poisonniere
to
and
chaussee
to
carlsbad
leipzig
heidelberg
marienbad
and
london
to
majorca
to
rue
tronchet
rue
pigalle
and
square
to
england
and
scotland
to
square
once
more
rue
chaillot
and
place
vendeme
and
then
pere
la
chaise
the
last
it
may
be
seen
that
chopin
was
a
restless
though
not
roving
nature
in
later
years
his
inability
to
remain
settled
in
one
place
bore
a
pathological
impress
consumptives
are
often
so
the
paris
of
the
paris
of
arts
and
letters
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
cities
in
the
world
for
the
the
molten
tide
of
passion
and
decorative
extravagance
that
swept
over
intellectual
europe
three
score
years
and
ten
ago
bore
on
its
foaming
crest
victor
hugo
prince
of
romanticists
near
by
was
henri
heine
he
left
heinrich
across
the
rhine
heine
who
dipped
his
pen
in
honey
and
gall
who
sneered
and
wept
in
the
same
couplet
the
star
of
classicism
had
seemingly
set
in
the
rich
conflict
of
genius
were
gautier
schumann
and
the
rest
all
was
romance
fantasy
and
passion
and
the
young
men
heard
the
moon
sing
silvery
you
remember
de
musset
and
the
leaves
rustle
rhythms
to
the
of
lovers
away
with
the
cried
he
of
the
scarlet
waistcoat
and
all
france
applauded
ernani
pity
it
was
that
the
romantic
infant
had
to
die
of
intellectual
anaemia
leaving
as
a
legacy
the
memories
and
work
of
one
of
the
most
marvellous
groupings
of
genius
since
the
athens
of
pericles
the
revolution
of
called
from
the
mud
the
sewermen
flaubert
his
face
to
the
past
gazed
sorrowfully
at
carthage
and
wrote
an
epic
of
the
french
bourgeois
zola
and
his
crowd
delved
into
a
moral
morass
and
the
world
grew
weary
of
them
and
then
the
faint
fading
flowers
of
romanticism
were
put
into
albums
where
their
purple
harmonies
and
subtle
sayings
are
pressed
into
sweet
twilight
forgetfulness
berlioz
mad
hector
of
the
flaming
locks
whose
orchestral
ozone
vivified
the
scores
of
wagnerand
liszt
began
to
sound
garishly
empty
brilliantly
superficial
the
colossal
nightingale
is
difficult
to
classify
even
a
romantic
by
temperament
he
unquestionably
was
but
then
his
music
all
color
nuance
and
brilliancy
was
not
genuinely
romantic
in
its
themes
compare
him
with
schumann
and
the
genuine
romanticist
tops
the
virtuoso
berlioz
i
suspect
was
a
magnified
virtuoso
his
orchestral
technique
is
supreme
but
his
music
fails
to
force
its
way
into
my
soul
it
pricks
the
nerves
it
pleases
the
sense
of
the
gigantic
the
strange
the
formless
but
there
is
something
uncanny
about
it
all
like
some
huge
prehistoric
bird
an
awful
pterodactyl
with
goggle
eyes
horrid
snout
and
scream
berlioz
like
baudelaire
has
the
power
of
evoking
the
shudder
but
as
john
addington
symonds
wrote
the
shams
of
the
classicists
the
spasms
of
the
romanticists
have
alike
to
be
abandoned
neither
on
a
mock
parnassus
nor
on

can
the
poet

the

the
quintessence

the
most
eloquent
page
in

chopin
is
the
narrative
of
an
evening
in
the
chaussee
for
it
demonstrates
the
literary
gifts
and
feeling
for
the
right
phrase
this
description
of
chopin
apartment
invaded
by
surprise
has
a
hypnotizing
effect
on
me
the
very
furnishings
of
the
chamber
seem
vocal
under
fanciful
pen
in
more
doubtful
taste
is
his
statement
that
the
glace
which
covers
the
grace
of
the
elite
as
it
does
the
fruit
of
their
desserts
could
not
have
been
satisfactory
to
chopin
liszt
despite
his
tendency
to
idealize
chopin
after
his
death
is
our
most
trustworthy
witness
at
this
period
chopin
was
an
ideal
to
liszt
though
he
has
not
left
us
a
record
of
his
defects
the
pole
was
ombrageux
and
easily
offended
he
disliked
democracies
in
fact
mankind
in
the
bulk
stunned
him
this
is
one
reason
combined
with
a
frail
physique
of
his
inability
to
conquer
the
larger
public
thalberg
could
do
it
his
aristocratic
tournure
imperturbability
beautiful
touch
and
polished
mechanism
won
the
suffrage
of
his
audiences
liszt
never
stooped
to
cajole
he
came
he
played
he
overwhelmed
chopin
knew
all
this
knew
his
weaknesses
and
fought
to
overcome
them
but
failed
another
crumpled
roseleaf
for
this
man
of
excessive
sensibility
since
told
of
liszt
and
first
related
by
him
is
the
anecdote
of
chopin
refusing
to
play
on
being
incautiously
pressed
after
dinner
giving
as
a
reason
ah
sir
i
have
eaten
so
little
even
though
his
host
was
gauche
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
retort
was
rude
chopin
met
osborne
mendelssohn
who
rather
patronized
him
with
his
chopinetto
baillot
the
violinist
and
franchomme
the
with
the
latter
he
contracted
a
lasting
friendship
often
playing
duos
with
him
and
dedicating
to
him
his
g
minor
sonata
he
called
on
kalkbrenner
then
the
first
pianist
of
his
day
who
was
puzzled
by
the
prodigious
novelty
of
the
young
pole
playing
having
heard
herz
and
hiller
chopin
did
not
fear
to
perform
his
e
minor
concerto
for
him
he
tells
all
about
the
interview
in
a
letter
to
titus
are
you
a
pupil
of
field
was
asked
by
kalkbrenner
who
remarked
that
chopin
had
the
style
of
cramer
and
the
touch
of
field
not
having
a
standard
by
which
to
gauge
the
new
phenomenon
kalkbrenner
was
forced
to
fall
back
on
the
playing
of
men
he
knew
he
then
begged
chopin
to
study
three
years
with
him
only
three
but
elsner
in
an
earnest
letter
dissuaded
his
pupil
from
making
any
experiments
that
might
hurt
his
originality
of
style
chopin
actually
attended
the
class
of
kalkbrenner
but
soon
quit
for
he
had
nothing
to
learn
of
the
pompous
penurious
pianist
the
hiller
story
of
how
mendelssohn
chopin
liszt
and
heller
teased
this
grouty
old
gentleman
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
is
capital
reading
if
not
absolutely
true
yet
chopin
admired
kalkbrenner
finished
technique
despite
his
platitudinous
manner
heine
said
or
rather
quoted
koreff
that
kalkbrenner
looked
like
a
bonbon
that
had
been
in
the
mud
niecks
thinks
chopin
might
have
learned
of
kalkbrenner
on
the
mechanical
side
chopin
in
public
was
modest
about
his
attainments
looking
upon
himself
as
i
can
not
create
a
new
school
because
i
do
not
even
know
the
old
he
said
it
is
this
very
absence
of
scholasticism
that
is
both
the
power
and
weakness
of
his
music
in
reality
his
true
technical
ancestor
was
hummel
he
played
the
e
minor
concerto
first
in
paris
february
and
some
smaller
pieces
although
kalkbrenner
baillot
and
others
participated
chopin
was
the
hero
of
the
evening
the
affair
was
a
financial
failure
the
audience
consisting
mostly
of
distinguished
and
aristocratic
poles
mendelssohn
who
disliked
kalkbrenner
and
was
angered
at
his
arrogance
in
asking
chopin
to
study
with
him
applauded
furiously
after
this
hiller
writes
nothing
more
was
heard
of
chopin
lack
of
technique
the
criticisms
were
favorable
on
may
chopin
appeared
at
a
charity
concert
organized
by
prince
de
la
moskowa
he
was
lionized
in
society
and
he
wrote
to
titus
that
his
heart
beat
in
syncopation
so
exciting
was
all
this
adulation
social
excitement
and
rapid
gait
of
living
but
he
still
sentimentalizes
to
titus
and
wishes
him
in
paris
a
flirtation
of
no
moment
with
francilla
pixis
the
adopted
daughter
of
pixis
the
hunchback
pianist
cruelly
mimicked
by
chopin
aroused
the
jealousy
of
the
elder
artist
chopin
was
delighted
for
he
was
malicious
in
a
dainty
way
what
do
you
think
of
this
he
writes
a
dangerous
seducteur
the
paris
letters
to
his
parents
were
unluckily
destroyed
as
karasowski
relates
by
russian
soldiers
in
warsaw
september
and
with
them
were
burned
his
portrait
by
ary
scheffer
and
his
first
piano
the
loss
of
the
letters
is
irremediable
karasowski
who
saw
some
of
them
says
they
were
tinged
with
melancholy
despite
his
artistic
success
chopin
needed
money
and
began
to
consider
again
his
projected
trip
to
america
luckily
he
met
prince
valentine
radziwill
on
the
street
so
it
is
said
and
was
persuaded
to
play
at
a
rothschild
soiree
from
that
moment
his
prospects
brightened
for
he
secured
paying
pupils
niecks
the
iconoclast
has
run
this
story
to
earth
and
finds
it
built
on
airy
romantic
foundations
liszt
hiller
franchomme
and
sowinski
never
heard
of
it
although
it
was
a
stock
anecdote
of
chopin
chopin
must
have
broadened
mentally
as
well
as
musically
in
this
congenial
artistic
environment
he
went
about
hobnobbed
with
princesses
and
of
the
effect
of
this
upon
his
compositions
there
can
be
no
doubt
if
he
became
more
cosmopolitan
he
also
became
more
artificial
and
for
a
time
the
salon
with
its
perfumed
elegant
atmosphere
threatened
to
drug
his
talent
into
forgetfulness
of
loftier
aims
luckily
the
life
intervened
and
real
troubles
chiselled
his
character
on
tragic
broader
and
more
passionate
lines
he
played
frequently
in
public
during
with
hiller
liszt
herz
and
osborne
and
much
in
private
there
was
some
rivalry
in
this
parterre
of
pianists
liszt
chopin
and
hiller
indulged
in
friendly
contests
and
chopin
always
came
off
winner
when
polish
music
was
essayed
he
delighted
in
imitating
his
colleagues
thalberg
especially
adolphe
brisson
tells
of
a
meeting
of
sand
chopin
and
thalberg
where
as
mathias
says
the
lady
chattered
like
a
magpie
and
thalberg
after
being
congratulated
by
chopin
on
his
magnificent
virtuosity
reeled
off
polite
phrases
in
return
doubtless
he
valued
the
pole
compliments
for
what
they
were
worth
the
moment
his
back
was
presented
chopin
at
the
keyboard
was
mocking
him
it
was
then
chopin
told
sand
of
his
pupil
georges
mathias
une
bonne
caboche
thalberg
took
his
revenge
whenever
he
could
after
a
concert
by
chopin
he
astonished
hiller
by
shouting
on
the
way
home
in
reply
to
questions
he
slily
answered
that
he
needed
a
forte
as
he
had
heard
nothing
but
pianissimo
the
entire
evening
chopin
was
never
a
hearty
partisan
of
the
romantic
movement
its
extravagance
misplaced
enthusiasm
turbulence
attacks
on
church
state
and
tradition
disturbed
the
finical
pole
while
noise
reclame
and
boisterousness
chilled
and
repulsed
him
he
wished
to
be
the
uhland
of
poland
but
he
objected
to
smashing
idols
and
refused
to
wade
in
gutters
to
reach
his
ideal
he
was
not
a
fighter
yet
as
one
reviews
the
past
half
century
it
is
his
still
small
voice
that
has
emerged
from
the
din
the
golden
voice
of
a
poet
and
not
the
roar
of
the
artistic
demagogues
of
his
day
liszt
influence
was
stimulating
but
what
did
not
chopin
do
for
liszt
read
schumann
he
managed
in
to
go
to
to
attend
the
lower
rhenish
music
festival
there
he
met
hiller
and
mendelssohn
at
the
painter
schadow
and
improvised
marvellously
so
hiller
writes
he
visited
coblenz
with
hiller
before
returning
home
professor
niecks
has
a
deep
spring
of
personal
humor
which
he
taps
at
rare
intervals
he
remarks
that
the
coming
to
paris
and
settlement
there
of
his
friend
matuszynski
must
have
been
very
gratifying
to
chopin
who
felt
so
much
the
want
of
one
with
whom
to
sigh
this
slanting
allusion
is
matched
by
his
treatment
of
george
sand
after
literally
ratting
her
in
a
separate
chapter
he
winds
up
his
work
with
the
solemn
assurance
that
he
abstains
from
pronouncing
judgment
because
the
complete
evidence
did
not
seem
to
me
to
warrant
my
doing
so
this
is
positively
delicious
when
i
met
this
biographer
at
bayreuth
in
i
told
him
how
much
i
had
enjoyed
his
work
adding
that
i
found
it
indispensable
in
the
of
chopin
professor
niecks
gazed
at
me
blandly
he
is
most
amiable
and
and
remarked
you
are
not
the
only
one
he
was
probably
thinking
of
the
many
who
have
had
recourse
to
his
human
documents
of
chopin
but
niecks
in
built
on
karasowski
liszt
schumann
sand
and
others
so
the
process
is
bound
to
continue
since
much
has
been
written
of
chopin
much
surmised
with
matuszysnki
the
composer
was
happier
he
devoutly
loved
his
country
and
despite
his
sarcasm
was
fond
of
his
countrymen
never
an
extravagant
man
he
invariably
assisted
the
poles
after
chopin
activity
as
a
public
pianist
began
to
wane
he
was
not
always
understood
and
was
not
so
warmly
welcomed
as
he
deserved
to
be
on
one
occasion
when
he
played
the
larghetto
of
his
f
minor
concerto
in
a
conservatoire
concert
its
frigid
reception
annoyed
him
very
much
nevertheless
he
appeared
at
a
benefit
concert
at
habeneck
april
the
papers
praised
but
his
irritability
increased
with
every
public
performance
about
this
time
he
became
acquainted
with
bellini
for
whose
sensuous
melodies
he
had
a
peculiar
predilection
in
july
chopin
met
his
father
at
carlsbad
then
he
went
to
dresden
and
later
to
leipzig
playing
privately
for
schumann
clara
wieck
wenzel
and
mendelssohn
schumann
gushes
over
chopin
but
this
friendliness
was
never
reciprocated
on
his
return
to
paris
chopin
visited
heidelberg
where
he
saw
the
father
of
his
pupil
adolphe
gutmann
and
reached
the
capital
of
the
civilized
world
the
middle
of
october
meanwhile
a
love
affair
had
occupied
his
attention
in
dresden
in
september
chopin
met
his
old
school
friends
the
wodzinskis
former
pupils
at
his
father
school
he
fell
in
love
with
their
sister
marie
and
they
became
engaged
he
spoke
to
his
father
about
the
matter
and
for
the
time
paris
and
his
ambitions
were
forgotten
he
enjoyed
a
brief
dream
of
marrying
and
of
settling
near
warsaw
teaching
and
composing
the
occasional
dream
that
tempts
most
active
artists
soothing
them
with
the
notion
that
there
is
really
a
haven
of
rest
from
the
world
buffets
again
the
gods
intervened
in
the
interest
of
music
the
father
of
the
girl
objected
on
the
score
of
chopin
means
and
his
social
position
artists
were
not
paderewskis
in
those
days
although
the
mother
favored
the
romance
the
wodzinskis
were
noble
and
wealthy
in
the
summer
of
at
marienbad
chopin
met
marie
again
in
the
engagement
was
broken
and
the
following
year
the
inconstant
beauty
married
the
son
of
chopin
godfather
count
frederic
skarbek
as
the
marriage
did
not
prove
a
success
perhaps
the
lady
played
too
much
chopin
a
divorce
ensued
and
later
she
married
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
orpiszewski
count
wodzinski
wrote
les
trois
romans
de
frederic
chopin
in
which
he
asserts
that
his
sister
rejected
chopin
at
marienbad
in
but
chopin
survived
the
shock
he
went
back
to
paris
and
in
july
accompanied
by
camille
pleyel
and
stanislas
kozmian
visited
england
for
the
first
time
his
stay
was
short
only
eleven
days
and
his
chest
trouble
dates
from
this
time
he
played
at
the
house
of
james
broadwood
the
piano
manufacturer
being
introduced
by
pleyel
as
fritz
but
his
performance
betrayed
his
identity
his
music
was
already
admired
by
amateurs
but
the
critics
with
a
few
exceptions
were
unfavorable
to
him
now
sounds
for
the
first
time
the
sinister
motif
of
the
george
sand
affair
in
deference
to
hadow
i
shall
not
call
it
a
liaison
it
was
not
in
the
vulgar
sense
chopin
might
have
been
petty
a
common
failing
of
artistic
men
but
he
was
never
vulgar
in
word
or
deed
he
disliked
the
woman
with
the
sombre
eye
before
he
had
met
her
her
reputation
was
not
good
no
matter
if
george
eliot
matthew
arnold
elizabeth
barrett
browning
and
others
believed
her
an
injured
saint
hadow
indignantly
repudiates
anything
that
savors
of
irregularity
in
the
relations
of
chopin
and
aurore
dudevant
if
he
honestly
believes
that
their
contemporaries
flagrantly
lied
and
that
the
woman
words
are
to
be
credited
why
by
all
means
let
us
leave
the
critic
in
his
utopia
mary
queen
of
scots
has
her
meline
why
should
not
sand
boast
of
at
least
one
apologist
for
her
life
besides
herself
i
do
not
say
this
with
cynical
intent
nor
do
i
propose
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
affair
which
has
been
dwelt
upon
ad
nauseam
by
every
twanger
of
the
romantic
string
the
idealists
will
always
see
a
union
of
souls
the
realists
and
there
were
plenty
of
them
in
paris
taking
notes
from
to
view
the
alliance
as
a
matter
for
gossip
the
truth
lies
midway
chopin
a
neurotic
being
met
the
polyandrous
sand
a
trampler
on
all
the
social
and
ethical
conventions
albeit
a
woman
of
great
gifts
repelled
at
first
he
gave
way
before
the
ardent
passion
she
manifested
toward
him
she
was
his
elder
so
could
veil
the
situation
with
the
maternal
mask
and
she
was
the
stronger
intellect
more
celebrated
chopin
was
but
a
pianist
in
the
eyes
of
the
many
and
so
won
by
her
magnetism
the
man
she
desired
paris
artistic
paris
was
full
of
such
situations
liszt
protected
the
countess
who
bore
him
children
cosima
von
among
the
rest
balzac
balzac
that
magnificent
combination
of
bonaparte
and
byron
pirate
and
poet
was
apparently
leading
the
life
of
a
saint
but
his
most
careful
student
viscount
spelboerch
de
lovenjoul
whose
name
is
veritably
tells
us
some
different
stories
even
gustave
flaubert
the
ascetic
giant
of
rouen
had
a
romance
with
madame
louise
colet
a
mediocre
writer
and
imitator
of
sand
as
was
countess
the
frankfort
jewess
better
known
as
daniel
stern
that
lasted
from
to
according
to
emile
faguet
here
then
was
a
medium
which
was
the
other
side
of
good
and
evil
a
new
transvaluation
of
morals
as
nietzsche
would
say
frederic
deplored
the
union
for
he
was
theoretically
a
catholic
did
he
not
once
resent
the
visit
of
liszt
and
a
companion
to
his
apartments
when
he
was
absent
indeed
he
may
be
fairly
called
a
moralist
carefully
reared
in
the
roman
catholic
religion
he
died
confessing
that
faith
with
the
exception
of
the
sand
episode
his
life
was
not
an
irregular
one
he
abhorred
the
vulgar
and
tried
to
conceal
this
infatuation
from
his
parents
this
intimacy
however
did
the
pair
no
harm
artistically
notwithstanding
the
inevitable
sorrow
and
heart
burnings
at
the
close
chopin
had
some
one
to
look
after
him
he
needed
it
and
in
the
society
of
this
brilliant
frenchwoman
he
throve
amazingly
his
best
work
may
be
traced
to
nohant
and
majorca
she
on
her
side
profited
also
after
the
bitterness
of
her
separation
from
alfred
de
musset
about
she
had
been
lonely
for
the
pagello
intermezzo
was
of
short
duration
the
de
story
was
not
known
in
its
entirety
until
again
spelboerch
de
lovenjoul
must
be
consulted
as
he
possessed
a
bundle
of
letters
that
were
written
by
george
sand
and
buloz
the
editor
of
la
revue
des
deux
mondes
in
de
musset
went
to
venice
with
sand
in
the
fall
of
they
had
the
maternal
sanction
and
means
supplied
by
madame
de
musset
the
story
gives
forth
the
true
gallic
resonance
on
being
critically
tapped
de
musset
returned
alone
sick
in
body
and
soul
and
thenceforth
absinthe
was
his
constant
solace
there
had
been
references
vague
and
disquieting
of
a
pagello
for
whom
sand
had
suddenly
manifested
one
of
her
extraordinary
fancies
this
she
denied
but
de
musset
brother
plainly
intimated
that
the
aggravating
cause
of
his
brother
illness
had
been
the
unexpected
vision
of
sand
coquetting
with
the
young
medical
man
called
in
to
prescribe
for
alfred
pagello
in
was
interviewed
by
cabanes
of
the
paris
figaro
and
here
is
his
story
of
what
had
happened
in
this
story
will
explain
the
later
behavior
of
la
merle
blanche
toward
chopin
one
night
george
sand
after
writing
three
pages
of
prose
full
of
poetry
and
inspiration
took
an
unaddressed
envelope
placed
therein
the
poetic
declaration
and
handed
it
to
pagello
he
seeing
no
address
did
not
or
feigned
not
to
understand
for
whom
the
letter
was
intended
and
asked
george
sand
what
he
should
do
with
it
snatching
the
letter
from
his
hands
she
wrote
upon
the
envelope
the
stupid
pagello
some
days
afterward
george
sand
frankly
told
de
musset
that
henceforth
she
could
be
to
him
only
a
friend
de
musset
died
in
and
after
his
death
sand
startled
paris
with
elle
et
lui
an
obvious
answer
to
confessions
of
a
child
of
the
age
de
musset
version
an
uncomplimentary
one
to
himself
of
their
separation
the
poet
brother
paul
rallied
to
his
memory
with
lui
et
elle
and
even
louisa
colet
ventured
into
the
fracas
with
a
trashy
novel
called
lui
during
all
this
the
cause
of
the
trouble
calmly
lived
in
the
little
italian
town
of
belluno
it
was
giuseppe
pagello
who
will
go
down
in
literary
history
as
the
one
man
that
played
joseph
to
george
sand
now
do
you
ask
why
i
believe
that
sand
left
chopin
when
she
was
bored
with
him
the
words
some
days
afterwards
are
significant
i
print
the
pagello
story
not
only
because
it
is
new
but
as
a
reminder
that
george
sand
in
her
love
affairs
was
always
the
man
she
treated
chopin
as
a
child
a
toy
used
him
for
literary
copy
pace
mr
hadow
and
threw
him
over
after
she
had
wrung
out
all
the
emotional
possibilities
of
the
problem
she
was
true
to
herself
even
when
she
attempted
to
palliate
her
want
of
heart
beware
of
the
woman
who
punctuates
the
pages
of
her
life
with
heart
and
maternal
feelings
if
i
do
not
believe
any
more
in
tears
it
is
because
i
saw
thee
crying
exclaimed
chopin
sand
was
the
product
of
abnormal
forces
she
herself
was
abnormal
and
her
mental
activity
while
it
created
no
permanent
types
in
literary
fiction
was
also
abnormal
she
dominated
chopin
as
she
had
dominated
jules
sandeau
calmatta
the
mezzotinter
de
musset
franz
liszt
delacroix
michel
de
bourges
i
have
not
the
exact
chronological
order
and
later
flaubert
the
most
lovable
event
in
the
life
of
this
much
loved
woman
was
her
old
age
affair
purely
platonic
with
gustave
flaubert
the
correspondence
shows
her
to
have
been
maternal
to
the
last
in
the
recently
published
lettres
a
of
honore
de
balzac
this
about
sand
is
very
apropos
a
visit
paid
to
george
sand
at
nohant
in
march
brought
the
following
to
madame
hanska
it
was
rather
well
that
i
saw
her
for
we
exchanged
confidences
regarding
sandeau
i
who
blamed
her
to
the
last
for
deserting
him
now
feel
only
a
deep
compassion
for
her
as
you
will
have
for
me
when
you
learn
with
whom
we
have
had
relations
she
of
love
i
of
friendship
but
she
has
been
even
more
unhappy
with
musset
so
here
she
is
in
retreat
denouncing
both
marriage
and
love
because
in
both
she
has
found
nothing
but
delusion
i
will
tell
you
of
her
immense
and
secret
devotion
to
these
two
men
and
you
will
agree
that
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
angels
and
devils
all
the
follies
she
has
committed
are
claims
to
glory
in
the
eyes
of
great
and
beautiful
souls
she
has
been
the
dupe
of
la
dorval
bocage
lamenais
etc
through
the
same
sentiment
she
is
the
dupe
of
liszt
and
madame
so
let
us
accept
without
too
much
questioning
as
did
balzac
a
reader
of
souls
the
partnership
and
follow
its
sinuous
course
until
chopin
met
sand
at
a
musical
matinee
in
niecks
throttles
every
romantic
yarn
about
the
pair
that
has
been
spoken
or
printed
he
got
his
facts
viva
voce
from
franchomme
sand
was
antipathetic
to
chopin
but
her
technique
for
overcoming
masculine
coyness
was
as
remarkable
in
its
particular
fashion
as
chopin
proficiency
at
the
keyboard
they
were
soon
seen
together
and
everywhere
she
was
not
musical
not
a
trained
musician
but
her
appreciation
for
all
art
forms
was
highly
sympathetic
not
a
beautiful
woman
being
swarthy
and
rather
in
figure
this
is
what
she
was
as
seen
by
edouard
grenier
she
was
short
and
stout
but
her
face
attracted
all
my
attention
the
eyes
especially
they
were
wonderful
eyes
a
little
too
close
together
it
may
be
large
with
full
eyelids
and
black
very
black
but
by
no
means
lustrous
they
reminded
me
of
unpolished
marble
or
rather
of
velvet
and
this
gave
a
strange
dull
even
cold
expression
to
her
countenance
her
fine
eyebrows
and
these
great
placid
eyes
gave
her
an
air
of
strength
and
dignity
which
was
not
borne
out
by
the
lower
part
of
her
face
her
nose
was
rather
thick
and
not
over
shapely
her
mouth
was
also
rather
coarse
and
her
chin
small
she
spoke
with
great
simplicity
and
her
manners
were
very
quiet
but
she
attracted
with
imperious
power
all
that
she
met
liszt
felt
this
attraction
at
one
time
and
it
is
whispered
that
chopin
was
jealous
of
him
pouf
the
woman
who
could
conquer
franz
liszt
in
his
youth
must
have
been
a
sorceress
he
too
was
versatile
in
sand
boy
maurice
being
ill
she
proposed
a
visit
to
majorca
chopin
went
with
the
party
in
november
and
full
accounts
of
the
mediterranean
trip
chopin
illness
the
bad
weather
discomforts
and
all
the
rest
may
be
found
in
the
histoire
de
ma
vie
by
sand
it
was
a
time
of
torment
chopin
is
a
detestable
invalid
said
sand
and
so
they
returned
to
nohant
in
june
they
saw
genoa
for
a
few
days
in
may
but
that
is
as
far
as
chopin
ever
penetrated
into
the
promised
land
italy
at
one
time
a
passion
with
him
sand
enjoyed
the
subtle
and
truly
feminine
pleasure
of
again
entering
the
city
which
six
years
before
she
had
visited
in
company
with
another
man
the
former
lover
of
rachel
chopin
health
in
was
a
source
of
alarm
to
himself
and
his
friends
he
had
been
dangerously
ill
at
majorca
and
marseilles
fever
and
severe
coughing
proved
to
be
the
dread
forerunners
of
the
disease
that
killed
him
ten
years
later
he
was
forced
to
be
very
careful
in
his
habits
resting
more
giving
fewer
lessons
playing
but
little
in
private
or
public
and
becoming
frugal
of
his
emotions
now
sand
began
to
cool
though
her
lively
imagination
never
ceased
making
graceful
touching
pictures
of
herself
in
the
roles
of
sister
of
mercy
mother
and
discreet
friend
all
merged
into
one
sentimental
composite
her
invalid
was
her
one
thought
and
for
an
active
mind
and
body
like
hers
it
must
have
been
irksome
to
submit
to
the
caprices
of
a
moody
ailing
man
he
composed
at
nohant
and
she
has
told
us
all
about
it
how
he
groaned
wrote
and
and
tore
to
pieces
draft
after
draft
of
his
work
this
brings
to
memory
another
martyr
to
style
gustave
flaubert
who
for
forty
years
in
a
room
at
croisset
near
rouen
wrestled
with
the
devils
of
syntax
and
epithet
chopin
was
of
an
impatient
nervous
disposition
all
the
more
remarkable
then
his
capacity
for
taking
infinite
pains
like
balzac
he
was
never
pleased
with
the
final
revise
of
his
work
he
must
needs
aim
at
finishing
touches
his
letters
at
this
period
are
interesting
for
the
chopinist
but
for
the
most
part
they
consist
of
requests
made
to
his
pupils
fontana
gutmann
and
others
to
jog
the
publishers
to
get
him
new
apartments
to
buy
him
many
things
wagner
was
not
more
importunate
or
minatory
than
this
pole
who
depended
on
others
for
the
material
comforts
and
necessities
of
his
existence
nor
is
his
abuse
of
friends
and
patrons
the
leos
and
others
indicative
of
an
altogether
frank
sincere
nature
he
did
not
hesitate
to
lump
them
all
as
pigs
and
jews
if
anything
happened
to
jar
his
nerves
money
money
is
the
leading
theme
of
the
paris
and
mallorean
letters
sand
was
a
spendthrift
and
chopin
had
often
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pocket
for
her
he
charged
twenty
francs
a
lesson
but
was
not
a
machine
and
for
at
least
four
months
of
the
year
he
earned
nothing
hence
his
anxiety
to
get
all
he
could
for
his
compositions
geniuses
are
sometimes
very
keen
in
financial
transactions
and
indeed
why
should
they
not
be
in
chopin
met
moscheles
they
appeared
together
at
st
cloud
playing
for
the
royal
family
chopin
received
a
gold
cup
moscheles
a
travelling
case
the
king
gave
him
this
said
the
amiable
frederic
to
get
the
sooner
rid
of
him
there
were
two
public
concerts
in
and
the
first
on
april
at
pleyel
rooms
the
second
on
february
at
the
same
hall
niecks
devotes
an
engrossing
chapter
to
the
public
accounts
and
the
general
style
of
chopin
playing
of
this
more
hereafter
from
to
chopin
taught
and
spent
the
vacations
at
nohant
to
which
charming
retreat
liszt
matthew
arnold
delacroix
charles
rollinat
and
many
others
came
his
life
was
apparently
happy
he
composed
and
amused
himself
with
maurice
and
solange
the
terrible
children
of
this
bohemian
household
there
according
to
reports
chopin
and
liszt
were
in
friendly
rivalry
are
two
pianists
ever
friendly
liszt
imitating
chopin
style
and
once
in
the
dark
they
exchanged
places
and
fooled
their
listeners
liszt
denied
this
another
story
is
of
one
or
the
other
working
the
pedal
rods
the
pedals
being
broken
this
too
has
been
laughed
to
scorn
by
liszt
nor
could
he
recall
having
played
while
sang
out
on
the
terrace
of
the
chateau
garcia
memory
is
also
short
about
this
event
rollinat
delacroix
and
sand
have
written
abundant
souvenirs
of
nohant
and
its
distinguished
gatherings
so
let
us
not
attempt
to
impugn
the
details
of
the
chopin
legend
that
legend
which
coughs
deprecatingly
as
it
points
to
its
aureoled
alabaster
brow
de
lenz
should
be
consulted
for
an
account
of
this
period
he
will
add
the
finishing
touches
of
unreality
that
may
be
missing
chopin
knew
every
one
of
note
in
paris
the
best
salons
were
open
to
him
some
of
his
confreres
have
not
hesitated
to
describe
him
as
a
bit
snobbish
for
during
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
he
was
generally
inaccessible
but
consider
his
retiring
nature
his
suspicious
slavic
temperament
above
all
his
delicate
health
where
one
accuses
him
of
indifference
and
selfishness
there
are
ten
who
praise
his
unfaltering
kindness
generosity
and
forbearance
he
was
as
a
rule
a
kind
and
patient
teacher
and
where
talent
was
displayed
his
interest
trebled
can
you
fancy
this
ariel
of
the
piano
giving
lessons
to
pupils
playing
in
a
charmed
and
bewitching
circle
of
countesses
surrounded
by
the
luxury
and
the
praise
that
kills
chopin
is
a
much
more
natural
figure
yet
he
gave
lessons
regularly
and
appeared
to
relish
them
he
had
not
much
taste
for
literature
he
liked
voltaire
though
he
read
but
little
that
was
not
polish
did
he
really
enjoy
sand
novels
and
when
asked
why
he
did
not
compose
symphonies
or
operas
answered
that
his
metier
was
the
piano
and
to
it
he
would
stick
he
spoke
french
though
with
a
polish
accent
and
also
german
but
did
not
care
much
for
german
music
except
bach
and
mozart
beethoven
save
in
the
c
sharp
minor
and
several
other
sonatas
was
not
sympathetic
schubert
he
found
rough
weber
in
his
piano
music
too
operatic
and
schumann
he
dismissed
without
a
word
he
told
heller
that
the
carneval
was
really
not
music
at
all
this
remark
is
one
of
the
curiosities
of
musical
anecdotage
but
he
had
his
gay
moments
when
he
would
gossip
chatter
imitate
every
one
cut
up
all
manner
of
tricks
and
like
wagner
stand
on
his
head
perhaps
it
was
feverish
agitated
gayety
yet
somehow
it
seemed
more
human
than
that
eternal
thaddeus
of
warsaw
melancholy
and
regret
for
the
vanished
greatness
and
happiness
of
poland
a
greatness
and
happiness
that
never
had
existed
chopin
disliked
letter
writing
and
would
go
miles
to
answer
one
in
person
he
did
not
hate
any
one
in
particular
being
rather
indifferent
to
every
one
and
to
political
events
except
where
poland
was
concerned
theoretically
he
hated
jews
and
russians
yet
associated
with
both
he
was
like
his
music
a
bundle
of
unreconciled
affirmations
and
evasions
and
never
could
have
been
contented
anywhere
or
with
any
one
of
himself
he
said
that
he
was
in
this
world
like
the
e
string
of
a
violin
on
a
contrabass
this
divine
dissatisfaction
led
him
to
extremes
to
the
flouting
of
friends
for
fancied
affronts
to
the
snubbing
of
artists
who
sometimes
visited
him
he
grew
suspicious
of
liszt
and
for
ten
years
was
not
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
him
although
they
never
openly
quarrelled
the
breach
which
had
been
very
perceptibly
widening
became
hopeless
in
when
sand
and
chopin
parted
forever
a
literature
has
grown
up
on
the
subject
chopin
never
had
much
to
say
but
sand
did
so
did
pupils
who
were
quite
virulent
in
their
assertions
that
she
killed
their
master
the
break
had
to
come
it
was
the
inevitable
end
of
such
a
friendship
the
dynamics
of
have
yet
to
be
formulated
this
much
we
know
two
such
natures
could
never
entirely
cohere
when
the
novelty
wore
off
the
stronger
of
the
two
the
one
least
in
love
took
the
initial
step
it
was
george
sand
who
took
it
with
chopin
he
would
never
have
had
the
courage
nor
the
will
the
final
causes
are
not
very
interesting
niecks
has
sifted
all
the
evidence
before
the
court
and
jury
of
the
main
quarrel
was
about
the
marriage
of
solange
sand
with
clesinger
the
sculptor
her
mother
did
not
oppose
the
match
but
later
she
resented
actions
he
was
coarse
and
violent
she
said
with
the
true
spirit
and
when
chopin
received
the
young
woman
and
her
husband
after
a
terrible
scene
at
nohant
she
broke
with
him
it
was
a
good
excuse
he
had
ennuied
her
for
several
years
and
as
he
had
completed
his
artistic
work
on
this
planet
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
studied
the
psychological
portrait
was
supposedly
painted
madame
george
got
rid
of
him
the
dark
stories
of
maternal
jealousy
of
chopin
preference
for
solange
the
visit
to
chopin
of
the
concierge
wife
to
complain
of
her
mistress
behavior
with
her
husband
all
these
rakings
i
leave
to
others
it
was
a
triste
affair
and
i
do
not
doubt
in
the
least
that
it
undermined
chopin
feeble
health
why
not
animals
die
of
broken
hearts
and
this
emotional
product
of
poland
deprived
of
affection
home
and
careful
attention
may
well
as
de
lenz
swears
have
died
of
recent
gossip
declares
that
sand
was
jealous
of
chopin
friendships
this
is
silly
a
walkley
the
english
dramatic
critic
after
declaring
that
he
would
rather
have
lived
during
the
balzac
epoch
in
paris
continues
in
this
entertaining
vein
and
then
one
might
have
had
a
chance
of
seeing
george
sand
in
the
thick
of
her
amorisms
for
my
part
i
would
certainly
rather
have
met
her
than
pontius
pilate
the
people
who
saw
her
in
her
old
age
flaubert
gautier
the
goncourts
have
left
us
copious
records
of
her
odd
appearance
her
perpetual
cigarette
smoking
and
her
whimsical
life
at
nohant
but
then
she
was
only
an
extinct
volcano
she
must
have
been
much
more
interesting
in
full
eruption
of
her
earlier
career
the
period
of
musset
and
pagello
she
herself
told
us
something
in
elle
et
lui
and
correspondence
published
a
year
or
so
ago
in
the
revue
de
paris
told
us
more
but
to
my
mind
the
most
fascinating
chapter
in
this
part
of
her
history
is
the
chopin
chapter
covering
the
next
decade
or
roughly
speaking
the
she
has
revealed
something
of
this
time
naturally
from
her
own
point
of
view
in
lucrezia
floriana
for
it
is
of
course
one
of
the
most
notorious
characteristics
of
george
sand
that
she
invariably
turned
her
loves
into
copy
the
mixture
of
passion
and
printer
ink
in
this
lady
composition
is
surely
one
of
the
most
curious
blends
ever
offered
to
the
palate
of
the
epicure
but
it
was
a
blend
which
gave
the
lady
an
unfair
advantage
for
posterity
we
hear
too
much
of
her
side
of
the
matter
this
one
feels
especially
as
regards
her
affair
with
chopin
with
musset
she
had
to
reckon
a
writer
like
herself
and
against
her
elle
et
lui
we
can
set
his
confession
enfant
du
siecle
but
poor
chopin
being
a
musician
was
not
good
at
copy
the
emotions
she
gave
him
he
had
to
pour
out
in
music
which
delightful
as
sound
is
unfortunately
vague
as
a
literary
document
how
one
longs
to
have
his
full
true
and
particular
account
of
the
six
months
he
spent
with
george
sand
in
majorca
pierre
mille
who
has
just
published
in
the
revue
bleue
some
letters
of
chopin
first
printed
it
seems
in
a
warsaw
newspaper
would
have
us
believe
that
the
lady
was
really
the
masculine
partner
we
are
to
understand
that
it
was
chopin
who
did
the
weeping
and
pouting
and
scene
while
george
sand
did
the
consoling
the
and
the
protecting
liszt
had
already
given
us
a
characteristic
anecdote
of
this
majorca
period
we
see
george
sand
in
sheer
exuberance
of
health
and
animal
spirits
wandering
out
into
the
storm
while
chopin
stays
at
home
to
have
an
attack
of
nerves
to
give
vent
to
his
anxiety
oh
artistic
temperament
by
composing
a
prelude
and
to
fall
fainting
at
the
lady
feet
when
she
returns
safe
and
sound
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
lady
had
enough
of
the
masculine
temper
in
her
to
be
the
first
to
get
tired
and
as
poor
chopin
was
coughing
and
swooning
most
of
the
time
this
is
scarcely
surprising
but
she
did
not
leave
him
forthwith
she
kept
up
the
pretence
of
loving
him
in
a
maternal
protecting
sort
of
way
out
of
pity
as
it
were
for
a
sick
child
so
much
the
published
letters
clearly
show
many
of
them
are
dated
from
nohant
but
in
themselves
the
letters
are
dull
enough
chopin
composed
with
the
keyboard
of
a
piano
with
ink
and
paper
he
could
do
little
probably
his
love
letters
were
wooden
productions
and
george
sand
we
know
was
a
fastidious
critic
in
that
matter
she
had
received
and
written
so
many
but
any
rate
chopin
did
not
write
whining
recriminations
like
mussel
his
real
view
of
her
we
shall
never
know
and
if
you
like
you
may
say
it
is
no
business
of
ours
she
once
uttered
a
truth
about
that
though
not
apropos
of
chopin
there
are
so
many
things
between
two
lovers
of
which
they
alone
can
be
the
judges
chopin
gave
his
last
concert
in
paris
february
at
pleyel
he
was
ill
but
played
beautifully
oscar
commettant
said
he
fainted
in
the
artist
room
sand
and
chopin
met
but
once
again
she
took
his
hand
which
was
trembling
and
cold
but
he
escaped
without
saying
a
word
he
permitted
himself
in
a
letter
to
grzymala
from
london
dated
november
to
speak
of
sand
i
have
never
cursed
any
one
but
now
i
am
so
weary
of
life
that
i
am
near
cursing
lucrezia
but
she
suffers
too
and
suffers
more
because
she
grows
older
in
wickedness
what
a
pity
about
soli
alas
everything
goes
wrong
with
the
world
i
wonder
what
hadow
thinks
of
this
reference
to
sand
soli
is
solange
sand
who
was
forced
to
leave
her
husband
because
of
as
her
mother
once
boxed
clesinger
ears
at
nohant
she
followed
the
example
in
trying
to
settle
the
affair
sand
quarrelled
hopelessly
with
her
daughter
that
energetic
descendant
of
emancipated
woman
formed
a
partnership
literary
of
course
with
the
marquis
alfieri
the
nephew
of
the
italian
poet
her
salon
was
as
much
in
vogue
as
her
mother
but
her
tastes
were
inclined
to
politics
revolutionary
politics
preferred
she
had
for
associates
gambetta
jules
ferry
floquet
taine
herve
weiss
the
critic
of
the
debats
henri
fouquier
and
many
others
she
had
the
curved
hebraic
nose
of
her
mother
and
hair
she
died
in
her
chateau
at
montgivray
and
was
buried
march
at
nohant
where
as
my
informant
says
her
mother
died
of
cigarette
smoking
she
was
a
clever
woman
and
wrote
a
book
masks
and
buffoons
maurice
sand
died
in
he
was
the
son
of
his
mother
who
was
gathered
to
her
heterogeneous
ancestors
june
in
literature
george
sand
is
a
feminine
pendant
to
jean
jacques
rousseau
full
of
troubled
fermenting
social
political
philosophical
and
religious
speculations
and
theories
she
wrote
picturesque
french
smooth
flowing
and
full
of
color
the
sketches
of
nature
of
country
life
have
positive
value
but
where
has
vanished
her
gallery
of
byronic
women
where
are
the
lelias
the
indianas
the
rudolstadts
she
had
not
as
henry
james
points
out
a
faculty
for
characterization
as
flaubert
wrote
her
in
spite
of
your
great
sphinx
eyes
you
have
always
seen
the
world
as
through
a
golden
mist
she
dealt
in
vague
vast
figures
and
so
her
prince
karol
in
lucrezia
floriana
unquestionably
intended
for
chopin
is
a
burlesque
little
wonder
he
was
angered
when
the
precious
children
asked
him
cher
chopin
have
you
read
mamma
has
put
you
in
it
of
all
persons
sand
was
to
give
to
the
world
a
true
a
sympathetic
picture
of
her
friend
she
understood
him
but
she
had
not
the
power
of
putting
him
between
the
coversof
a
book
if
flaubert
or
better
still
pierre
loti
could
have
known
chopin
so
intimately
we
should
possess
a
memoir
in
which
every
vibration
of
emotion
would
be
recorded
every
shade
noted
and
all
pinned
with
the
precise
adjective
the
phrase
exquisite
iii
england
scotland
and
pere
la
chaise
the
remaining
years
of
chopin
life
were
lonely
his
father
died
in
of
chest
and
heart
complaint
his
sister
emilia
died
of
consumption
these
and
shortly
after
john
matuszynski
died
titus
woyciechowski
was
in
poland
on
his
estates
and
chopin
had
but
grzymala
and
fontana
to
confide
in
they
being
polish
he
preferred
them
although
he
was
diplomatic
enough
not
to
let
others
see
this
both
franchomme
and
gutmann
whispered
to
niecks
at
different
times
that
each
was
the
particular
soul
the
alter
ego
of
chopin
he
appeared
to
give
himself
to
his
friends
but
it
was
usually
surface
affection
he
had
coaxing
coquettish
ways
playful
ways
that
cost
him
nothing
when
in
good
spirits
so
he
was
more
loved
than
loving
this
is
another
trait
of
the
man
which
allied
with
his
fastidiousness
and
spiritual
brusquerie
made
him
difficult
to
decipher
the
loss
of
sand
completed
his
misery
and
we
find
him
in
poor
health
when
he
arrived
in
london
for
the
second
and
last
time

the

of

to
this
amiable

learned
writer
on

franz

joseph

are
indebted
for
the
most
of
their
facts
from
them
the
curious
may
learn
all
there
is
to
learn
the
story
is
not
especially
noteworthy
being
in
the
main
a
record
of
complainings
lamentations
and
not
one
signal
artistic
success
war
was
declared
upon
chopin
by
a
part
of
the
musical
world
the
criticism
was
compounded
of
pure
malice
and
stupidity
chopin
was
angered
but
little
for
he
was
too
sick
to
care
now
he
went
to
an
evening
party
but
missed
the
macready
dinner
where
he
was
to
have
met
thackeray
berlioz
procter
and
sir
julius
benedict
with
benedict
he
played
a
mozart
duet
at
the
duchess
of
sutherland
whether
he
played
at
court
the
queen
can
tell
niecks
can
not
he
met
jenny
and
liked
her
exceedingly
as
did
all
who
had
the
honor
of
knowing
her
she
sided
with
him
in
the
sand
affair
echoes
of
which
had
floated
across
the
channel
and
visited
him
in
paris
in
chopin
gave
two
matinees
at
the
houses
of
adelaide
kemble
and
lord
falmouth
june
and
july
they
were
very
recherche
so
it
appears
sang
the
composer
face
and
frame
were
wasted
by
illness
and
solomon
spoke
of
his
long
attenuated
fingers
he
made
money
and
that
was
useful
to
him
for
doctors
bills
and
living
had
taken
up
his
savings
there
was
talk
of
his
settling
in
london
but
the
climate
not
to
speak
of
the
unmusical
atmosphere
would
have
been
fatal
to
him
wagner
succumbed
to
both
sturdy
fighter
that
he
was
chopin
left
for
scotland
in
august
and
stopped
at
the
house
of
his
pupil
miss
stirling
her
name
is
familiar
to
chopin
students
for
the
two
nocturnes
opus
are
dedicated
to
her
he
was
nearly
killed
with
kindness
but
continually
bemoaned
his
existence
at
the
house
of
lyschinski
a
pole
he
lodged
in
edinburgh
and
was
so
weak
that
he
had
to
be
carried
up
and
down
stairs
to
the
doctor
good
wife
he
replied
in
answer
to
the
question
george
sand
is
your
particular
friend
not
even
george
sand
and
is
he
to
be
blamed
for
evading
tiresome
reminders
of
the
past
he
confessed
that
his
excessive
thinness
had
caused
sand
to
address
him
as
my
dear
corpse
charming
is
it
not
miss
stirling
was
doubtless
in
love
with
him
and
princess
czartoryska
followed
him
to
scotland
to
see
if
his
health
was
better
so
he
was
not
altogether
deserted
by
the
women
indeed
he
could
not
live
without
their
little
flatteries
and
agreeable
attentions
it
is
safe
to
say
that
a
woman
was
always
within
call
of
chopin
he
played
at
manchester
on
the
of
august
but
his
friend
osborne
who
was
present
says
his
playing
was
too
delicate
to
create
enthusiasm
and
i
felt
truly
sorry
for
him
on
his
return
to
scotland
he
stayed
with
and
salis
schwabe
cuthbert
hadden
wrote
several
years
ago
in
the
glasgow
herald
of
chopin
visit
to
scotland
in
the
was
in
the
poorest
health
but
with
characteristic
tenacity
played
at
concerts
and
paid
visits
to
his
admirers
hadden
found
the
following
notice
in
the
back
files
of
the
glasgow
courier
monsieur
chopin
has
the
honour
to
announce
that
his
matinee
musicale
will
take
place
on
wednesday
the
september
in
the
merchant
hall
glasgow
to
commence
at
two
tickets
limited
in
number
each
and
full
particulars
to
be
had
from
muir
wood
buchanan
street
he
continues
the
net
profits
of
this
concert
are
said
to
have
been
exactly
a
ridiculously
low
sum
when
we
compare
it
with
the
earnings
of
later
day
virtuosi
nay
still
more
ridiculously
low
when
we
recall
the
circumstance
that
for
two
concerts
in
glasgow
sixteen
years
before
this
paganini
had
l
muir
wood
who
has
since
died
said
i
was
then
a
comparative
stranger
in
glasgow
but
i
was
told
that
so
many
private
carriages
had
never
been
seen
at
any
concert
in
the
town
in
fact
it
was
the
county
people
who
turned
out
with
a
few
of
the
elite
of
glasgow
society
being
a
morning
concert
the
citizens
were
busy
otherwise
and
half
a
guinea
was
considered
too
high
a
sum
for
their
wives
and
daughters
the
late
james
hedderwick
of
glasgow
tells
in
his
reminiscences
that
on
entering
the
hall
he
found
it
about
full
it
was
obvious
that
a
number
of
the
audience
were
personal
friends
of
chopin
hedderwick
recognized
the
composer
at
once
as
a
little
man
in
pale
gray
suit
including
frock
coat
of
identical
tint
and
texture
moving
about
among
the
company
conversing
with
different
groups
and
occasionally
consulting
his
watch
which
seemed
to
be
no
bigger
than
an
agate
stone
on
the
forefinger
of
an
alderman
whiskerless
beardless
fair
of
hair
and
pale
and
thin
of
face
his
appearance
was
interesting
and
conspicuous
and
when
after
a
final
glance
at
his
miniature
horologe
he
ascended
the
platform
and
placed
himself
at
the
instrument
he
at
once
commanded
attention
hedderwick
says
it
was
a
entertainment
more
piano
than
forte
though
not
without
occasional
episodes
of
both
strength
and
grandeur
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
him
that
chopin
was
marked
for
an
early
grave
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
there
are
now
living
only
two
members
of
that
glasgow
audience
of
one
of
the
two
is
julius
seligmann
the
veteran
president
of
the
glasgow
society
of
musicians
who
in
response
to
some
inquiries
on
the
subject
writes
as
follows
several
weeks
before
the
concert
chopin
lived
with
different
friends
or
pupils
on
their
invitations
in
the
surrounding
counties
i
think
his
pupil
miss
jane
stirling
had
something
to
do
with
all
the
general
arrangements
muir
wood
managed
the
special
arrangements
of
the
concert
and
i
distinctly
remember
him
telling
me
that
he
never
had
so
much
difficulty
in
arranging
a
concert
as
on
this
occasion
chopin
constantly
changed
his
mind
wood
had
to
visit
him
several
times
at
the
house
of
admiral
napier
at
milliken
park
near
johnstone
but
scarcely
had
he
returned
to
glasgow
when
he
was
summoned
back
to
alter
something
the
concert
was
given
in
the
merchant
hall
hutcheson
street
now
the
county
buildings
the
hall
was
about
filled
between
chopin
playing
madame
adelasio
de
margueritte
daughter
of
a
london
physician
sang
and
muir
accompanied
her
chopin
was
evidently
very
his
touch
was
very
feeble
and
while
the
finish
grace
elegance
and
delicacy
of
his
performances
were
greatly
admired
by
the
audience
the
want
of
power
made
his
playing
somewhat
monotonous
i
do
not
remember
the
whole
programme
but
he
was
encored
for
his
mazurka
in
b
flat
op
no
which
he
repeated
with
quite
different
nuances
from
those
of
the
first
time
the
audience
was
very
aristocratic
consisting
mostly
of
ladies
among
whom
were
the
then
duchess
of
argyll
and
her
sister
lady
blantyre
the
other
survivor
is
george
russell
alexander
son
of
the
proprietor
of
the
theatre
royal
dunlop
street
who
in
a
letter
to
the
writer
remarks
especially
upon
chopin
pale
cadaverous
appearance
my
emotion
he
says
was
so
great
that
two
or
three
times
i
was
compelled
to
retire
from
the
room
to
recover
myself
i
have
heard
all
the
best
and
most
celebrated
stars
of
the
musical
firmament
but
never
one
has
left
such
an
impress
on
my
mind
chopin
played
october
in
edinburgh
and
returned
to
london
in
november
after
various
visits
we
read
of
a
polish
ball
and
concert
at
which
he
played
but
the
affair
was
not
a
success
he
left
england
in
january
and
heartily
glad
he
was
to
go
do
you
see
the
cattle
in
this
meadow
he
asked
en
route
for
paris
ca
a
plus
que
des
anglais
which
was
not
nice
of
him
perhaps
niedzwiecki
to
whom
he
made
the
remark
took
as
earnest
a
pure
bit
of
nonsense
and
perhaps
he
certainly
disliked
england
and
the
english
now
the
curtain
prepares
to
fall
on
the
last
dreary
finale
of
life
a
life
not
for
a
moment
heroic
yet
lived
according
to
his
lights
and
free
from
the
sordid
and
the
soil
of
vulgarity
jules
janin
said
he
lived
ten
miraculous
years
with
a
breath
ready
to
fly
away
and
we
know
that
his
servant
daniel
had
always
to
carry
him
to
bed
for
ten
years
he
had
suffered
from
so
much
illness
that
a
relapse
was
not
noticed
by
the
world
his
very
death
was
at
first
received
with
incredulity
for
as
stephen
heller
said
he
had
been
reported
dead
so
often
that
the
real
news
was
doubted
in
his
legs
began
to
bother
him
by
swelling
and
mathias
described
him
as
a
painful
spectacle
the
picture
of
exhaustion
the
back
bent
head
bowed
but
always
amiable
and
full
of
distinction
his
purse
was
empty
and
his
lodgings
in
the
rue
chaillot
were
represented
to
the
proud
man
as
being
just
half
their
cost
the
balance
being
paid
by
the
countess
obreskoff
a
russian
lady
like
a
romance
is
the
sending
by
miss
stirling
of
thousand
francs
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
the
scotchwoman
heard
of
chopin
needs
through
madame
rubio
a
pupil
and
the
money
was
raised
that
packet
containing
it
was
mislaid
or
lost
by
the
portress
of
chopin
house
but
found
after
the
woman
had
been
taxed
with
keeping
it
chopin
his
future
assured
moved
to
place
vendome
no
there
he
died
his
sister
louise
was
sent
for
and
came
from
poland
to
paris
in
the
early
days
of
october
he
could
no
longer
sit
upright
without
support
gutmann
and
the
countess
delphine
potocka
his
sister
and
gavard
were
constantly
with
him
it
was
turgenev
who
spoke
of
the
half
hundred
countesses
in
europe
who
claimed
to
have
held
the
dying
chopin
in
their
arms
in
reality
he
died
in
gutmann
raising
that
hand
to
his
mouth
and
murmuring
cher
ami
as
he
expired
solange
sand
was
there
but
not
her
mother
who
called
and
was
not
admitted
so
they
say
gutmann
denies
having
refused
her
admittance
on
the
other
hand
if
she
had
called
chopin
friends
would
have
kept
her
away
from
him
from
the
man
who
told
franchomme
two
days
before
his
death
she
said
to
me
that
i
would
die
in
no
arms
but
hers
surely
unless
she
was
monstrous
in
her
egotism
and
she
was
not
george
sand
did
not
hear
this
sad
speech
without
tears
and
boundless
regrets
alas
all
things
come
too
late
for
those
who
wait
tarnowski
relates
that
chopin
gave
his
last
orders
in
perfect
consciousness
he
begged
his
sister
to
burn
all
his
inferior
compositions
i
owe
it
to
the
public
he
said
and
to
myself
to
publish
only
good
things
i
kept
to
this
resolution
all
my
life
i
wish
to
keep
to
it
now
this
wish
has
not
been
respected
the
posthumous
publications
are
for
the
most
part
feeble
stuff
chopin
died
october
between
three
and
four
in
the
morning
after
having
been
shrived
by
the
abbe
jelowicki
his
last
word
according
to
gavard
was
plus
on
being
asked
if
he
suffered
regarding
the
touching
and
slightly
melodramatic
death
bed
scene
on
the
day
previous
when
delphine
potocka
sang
stradella
and
mozart
or
was
it
marcello
liszt
karasowski
and
gutmann
disagree
the
following
authentic
account
of
the
last
hours
of
chopin
appears
here
for
the
first
time
in
english
translated
by
hugh
craig
in
liszt
work
on
chopin
second
edition
mention
is
made
of
a
conversation
that
he
had
held
with
the
abbe
jelowicki
respecting
chopin
death
and
in
niecks
biography
of
chopin
some
sentences
from
letters
by
the
abbe
are
quoted
these
letters
written
in
french
have
been
translated
and
published
in
the
allgemeine
musik
zeitung
to
which
they
were
given
by
the
princess
marie
hohenlohe
the
daughter
of
princess
caroline
sayn
wittgenstein
liszt
universal
legatee
and
executor
who
died
in
for
many
years
so
runs
the
document
the
life
of
chopin
was
but
a
breath
his
frail
weak
body
was
visibly
unfitted
for
the
strength
and
force
of
his
genius
it
was
a
wonder
how
in
such
a
weak
state
he
could
live
at
all
and
occasionally
act
with
the
greatest
energy
his
body
was
almost
diaphanous
his
eyes
were
almost
shadowed
by
a
cloud
from
which
from
time
to
time
the
lightnings
of
his
glance
flashed
gentle
kind
bubbling
with
humor
and
every
way
charming
he
seemed
no
longer
to
belong
to
earth
while
unfortunately
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
heaven
he
had
good
friends
but
many
bad
friends
these
bad
friends
were
his
flatterers
that
is
his
enemies
men
and
women
without
principles
or
rather
with
bad
principles
even
his
unrivalled
success
so
much
more
subtle
and
thus
so
much
more
stimulating
than
that
of
all
other
artists
carried
the
war
into
his
soul
and
checked
the
expression
of
faith
and
of
prayer
the
teachings
of
the
fondest
most
pious
mother
became
to
him
a
recollection
of
his
childhood
love
in
the
place
of
faith
doubt
had
stepped
in
and
only
that
decency
innate
in
every
generous
heart
hindered
him
from
indulging
in
sarcasm
and
mockery
over
holy
things
and
the
consolations
of
religion
while
he
was
in
this
spiritual
condition
he
was
attacked
by
the
pulmonary
disease
that
was
soon
to
carry
him
away
from
us
the
knowledge
of
this
cruel
sickness
reached
me
on
my
return
from
rome
with
beating
heart
i
hurried
to
him
to
see
once
more
the
friend
of
my
youth
whose
soul
was
infinitely
dearer
to
me
than
all
his
talent
i
found
him
not
thinner
for
that
was
impossible
but
weaker
his
strength
sank
his
life
faded
visibly
he
embraced
me
with
affection
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
thinking
not
of
his
own
pain
but
of
mine
he
spoke
of
my
poor
friend
eduard
worte
whom
i
had
just
lost
you
know
how
he
was
shot
a
martyr
of
liberty
at
vienna
november
i
availed
myself
of
his
softened
mood
to
speak
to
him
about
his
soul
i
recalled
his
thoughts
to
the
piety
of
his
childhood
and
of
his
beloved
mother
yes
he
said
in
order
not
to
offend
my
mother
i
would
not
die
without
the
sacraments
but
for
my
part
i
do
not
regard
them
in
the
sense
that
you
desire
i
understand
the
blessing
of
confession
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
unburdening
of
a
heavy
heart
into
a
friendly
hand
but
not
as
a
sacrament
i
am
ready
to
confess
to
you
if
you
wish
it
because
i
love
you
not
because
i
hold
it
necessary
enough
a
crowd
of
speeches
filled
me
with
terror
and
care
for
this
elect
soul
and
i
feared
nothing
more
than
to
be
called
to
be
his
confessor
several
months
passed
with
similar
conversations
so
painful
to
me
the
priest
and
the
sincere
friend
yet
i
clung
to
the
conviction
that
the
grace
of
god
would
obtain
the
victory
over
this
rebellious
soul
even
if
i
knew
not
how
after
all
my
exertions
prayer
remained
my
only
refuge
on
the
evening
of
october
i
had
with
my
brethren
retired
to
pray
for
a
change
in
chopin
mind
when
i
was
summoned
by
orders
of
the
physician
in
fear
that
he
would
not
live
through
the
night
i
hastened
to
him
he
pressed
my
hand
but
bade
me
at
once
to
depart
while
he
assured
me
he
loved
me
much
but
did
not
wish
to
speak
to
me
imagine
if
you
can
what
a
night
i
passed
next
day
was
the
the
day
of
edward
the
patron
of
my
poor
brother
i
said
mass
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
and
prayed
for
soul
my
god
i
cried
if
the
soul
of
my
brother
edward
is
pleasing
to
thee
give
me
this
day
the
soul
of
frederic
in
double
distress
i
then
went
to
the
melancholy
abode
of
our
poor
sick
man
i
found
him
at
breakfast
which
was
served
as
carefully
as
ever
and
after
he
had
asked
me
to
partake
i
said
my
friend
today
is
the
name
day
of
my
poor
brother
oh
do
not
let
us
speak
of
it
he
cried
dearest
friend
i
continued
you
must
give
me
something
for
my
brother
name
day
what
shall
i
give
you
your
soul
ah
i
understand
here
it
is
take
it
at
these
words
unspeakable
joy
and
anguish
seized
me
what
should
i
say
to
him
what
should
i
do
to
restore
his
faith
how
not
to
lose
instead
of
saving
this
beloved
soul
how
should
i
begin
to
bring
it
back
to
god
i
flung
myself
on
my
knees
and
after
a
moment
of
collecting
my
thoughts
i
cried
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
draw
it
to
thee
thyself
my
god
without
saying
a
word
i
held
out
to
our
dear
invalid
the
crucifix
rays
of
divine
light
flames
of
divine
fire
streamed
i
might
say
visibly
from
the
figure
of
the
crucified
saviour
and
at
once
illumined
the
soul
and
kindled
the
heart
of
chopin
burning
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
his
faith
was
once
more
revived
and
with
unspeakable
fervor
he
made
his
confession
and
received
the
holy
supper
after
the
blessed
viaticum
penetrated
by
the
heavenly
consecration
which
the
sacraments
pour
forth
on
pious
souls
he
asked
for
extreme
unction
he
wished
to
pay
lavishly
the
sacristan
who
accompanied
me
and
when
i
remarked
that
the
sum
presented
by
him
was
twenty
times
too
much
he
replied
oh
no
for
what
i
have
received
is
beyond
price
from
this
hour
he
was
a
saint
the
death
struggle
began
and
lasted
four
days
patience
trust
in
god
even
joyful
confidence
never
left
him
in
spite
of
all
his
sufferings
till
the
last
breath
he
was
really
happy
and
called
himself
happy
in
the
midst
of
the
sharpest
sufferings
he
expressed
only
ecstatic
joy
touching
love
of
god
thankfulness
that
i
had
led
him
back
to
god
contempt
of
the
world
and
its
good
and
a
wish
for
a
speedy
death
he
blessed
his
friends
and
when
after
an
apparently
last
crisis
he
saw
himself
surrounded
by
the
crowd
that
day
and
night
filled
his
chamber
he
asked
me
why
do
they
not
pray
at
these
words
all
fell
on
their
knees
and
even
the
protestants
joined
in
the
litanies
and
prayers
for
the
dying
day
and
night
he
held
my
hand
and
would
not
let
me
leave
him
no
you
will
not
leave
me
at
the
last
moment
he
said
and
leaned
on
my
breast
as
a
little
child
in
a
moment
of
danger
hides
itself
in
its
mother
breast
soon
he
called
upon
jesus
and
mary
with
a
fervor
that
reached
to
heaven
soon
he
kissed
the
crucifix
in
an
excess
of
faith
hope
and
love
he
made
the
most
touching
utterances
i
love
god
and
man
he
said
i
am
happy
so
to
die
do
not
weep
my
sister
my
friends
do
not
weep
i
am
happy
i
feel
that
i
am
dying
farewell
pray
for
me
exhausted
by
deathly
convulsions
he
said
to
the
physicians
let
me
die
do
not
keep
me
longer
in
this
world
of
exile
let
me
die
why
do
you
prolong
my
life
when
i
have
renounced
all
things
and
god
has
enlightened
my
soul
god
calls
me
why
do
you
keep
me
back
another
time
he
said
o
lovely
science
that
only
lets
one
suffer
longer
could
it
give
me
back
my
strength
qualify
me
to
do
any
good
to
make
any
sacrifice
but
a
life
of
fainting
of
grief
of
pain
to
all
who
love
me
to
prolong
such
a
life
o
lovely
science
then
he
said
again
you
let
me
suffer
cruelly
perhaps
you
have
erred
about
my
sickness
but
god
errs
not
he
punishes
me
and
i
bless
him
therefor
oh
how
good
is
god
to
punish
me
here
below
oh
how
good
god
is
his
usual
language
was
always
elegant
with
well
chosen
words
but
at
last
to
express
all
his
thankfulness
and
at
the
same
time
all
the
misery
of
those
who
die
unreconciled
to
god
he
cried
without
you
i
should
have
croaked
krepiren
like
a
pig
while
dying
he
still
called
on
the
names
of
jesus
mary
joseph
kissed
the
crucifix
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
with
the
cry
now
i
am
at
the
source
of
blessedness
thus
died
chopin
and
in
truth
his
death
was
the
most
beautiful
concerto
of
all
his
life
the
worthy
abbe
must
have
had
a
phenomenal
memory
i
hope
that
it
was
an
exact
one
his
story
is
given
in
its
entirety
because
of
its
novelty
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
feel
in
the
least
sceptical
is
that
la
mara
the
pen
name
of
a
writer
on
musical
subjects
translated
these
letters
into
german
but
every
one
agrees
that
chopin
end
was
serene
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
musical
of
history
another
was
mozart
his
face
was
beautiful
and
young
in
the
coffin
says
liszt
he
was
buried
from
the
madeleine
october
with
the
ceremony
befitting
a
man
of
genius
the
b
flat
minor
funeral
march
orchestrated
by
henri
reber
was
given
and
during
the
ceremony
played
on
the
organ
the
e
and
b
minor
preludes
the
were
distinguished
men
meyerbeer
delacroix
pleyel
and
franchomme
at
least
theophile
gautier
so
reported
it
for
his
journal
even
at
his
grave
in
pere
la
chaise
no
two
persons
could
agree
about
chopin
this
controversy
is
quite
characteristic
of
chopin
who
was
always
the
calm
centre
of
argument
he
was
buried
in
evening
clothes
his
concert
dress
but
not
at
his
own
request
kwiatowski
the
portrait
painter
told
this
to
niecks
it
is
a
polish
custom
for
the
dying
to
select
their
grave
clothes
yet
lombroso
writes
that
chopin
in
his
will
directed
that
he
should
be
buried
in
a
white
tie
small
shoes
and
short
breeches
adducing
this
as
an
evidence
of
his
insanity
he
further
adds
he
abandoned
the
woman
whom
he
tenderly
loved
because
she
offered
a
chair
to
some
one
else
before
giving
the
same
invitation
to
himself
here
we
have
a
sand
story
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
diagnosed
symptom
it
is
like
the
other
nonsense
iv
the
artist
chopin
personality
was
a
pleasant
persuasive
one
without
being
so
striking
or
so
dramatic
as
liszt
as
a
youth
his
nose
was
too
large
his
lips
thin
the
lower
one
protruding
later
moscheles
said
that
he
looked
like
his
music
delicacy
and
a
certain
aristrocratic
bearing
a
harmonious
ensemble
produced
a
most
agreeable
sensation
he
was
of
slim
frame
middle
height
fragile
but
wonderfully
flexible
limbs
delicately
formed
hands
very
small
feet
an
oval
softly
outlined
head
a
pale
transparent
complexion
long
silken
hair
of
a
light
chestnut
color
parted
on
one
side
tender
brown
eyes
intelligent
rather
than
dreamy
a
aquiline
nose
a
sweet
subtle
smile
graceful
and
varied
gestures
this
precise
description
is
by
niecks
liszt
said
he
had
blue
eyes
but
he
has
been
overruled
chopin
was
fond
of
elegant
costly
attire
and
was
very
correct
in
the
matter
of
studs
walking
sticks
and
cravats
not
the
ideal
musician
we
read
of
but
a
gentleman
berlioz
told
legouve
to
see
chopin
for
he
is
something
which
you
have
never
seen
and
some
one
you
will
never
forget
an
orchidaceous
individuality
this
with
such
personal
refinement
he
was
a
man
punctual
and
precise
in
his
habits
associating
constantly
with
fashionable
folk
his
naturally
dignified
behavior
was
increased
he
was
an
aristocrat
there
is
no
other
word
and
he
did
not
care
to
be
with
the
musicians
a
certain
primness
and
asperity
did
not
make
him
popular
while
teaching
his
manner
warmed
the
earnest
artist
came
to
life
all
halting
of
speech
and
polite
insincerities
were
abandoned
his
pupils
adored
him
here
at
least
the
sentiment
was
one
of
solidarity
de
lenz
is
his
most
censorious
critic
and
did
not
really
love
chopin
the
dislike
was
returned
for
the
pole
suspected
that
his
pupil
was
sent
by
liszt
to
spy
on
his
methods
this
i
heard
in
paris
chopin
was
a
remarkable
teacher
he
never
taught
but
one
genius
little
filtsch
the
hungarian
lad
of
whom
liszt
said
when
he
starts
playing
i
will
shut
up
shop
the
boy
died
in
aged
fifteen
paul
gunsberg
who
died
the
same
year
was
also
very
talented
once
after
delivering
in
a
lovely
way
the
master
e
minor
concerto
filtsch
was
taken
by
chopin
to
a
music
store
and
presented
with
the
score
of
beethoven
fidelio
he
was
much
affected
by
the
talents
of
this
youthful
pupil
lindsay
sloper
and
brinley
richards
studied
with
chopin
caroline
hartmann
gutmann
lysberg
georges
mathias
mlle
many
polish
ladies
of
rank
delphine
potocka
among
the
rest
madame
streicher
carl
mikuli
madame
rubio
madame
peruzzi
thomas
tellefsen
casimir
wernik
gustav
schumann
werner
steinbrecher
and
many
others
became
excellent
pianists
was
the
american
pianist
louis
moreau
gottschalk
ever
his
pupil
his
friends
say
so
but
niecks
does
not
mention
him
ernst
pauer
questions
it
we
know
that
gottschalk
studied
in
paris
with
camille
stamaty
and
made
his
first
appearance
there
in
this
was
shortly
before
chopin
death
when
his
interest
in
music
had
abated
greatly
no
doubt
gottschalk
played
for
chopin
for
he
was
the
first
to
introduce
the
pole
music
in
america
chopin
was
very
particular
about
the
formation
of
the
touch
giving
clementi
preludes
at
first
is
that
a
dog
barking
was
his
sudden
exclamation
at
a
rough
attack
he
taught
the
scales
staccato
and
legato
beginning
with
e
major
ductility
ease
gracefulness
were
his
aim
stiffness
harshness
annoyed
him
he
gave
clementi
moscheles
and
bach
before
playing
in
concert
he
shut
himself
up
and
played
not
chopin
but
bach
always
bach
absolute
finger
independence
and
touch
discrimination
and
color
are
to
be
gained
by
playing
the
preludes
and
fugues
of
bach
chopin
started
a
method
but
it
was
never
finished
and
his
sister
gave
it
to
the
princess
czartoryska
after
his
death
it
is
a
mere
fragment
janotha
has
translated
it
one
point
is
worth
quoting
he
wrote
no
one
notices
inequality
in
the
power
of
the
notes
of
a
scale
when
it
is
played
very
fast
and
equally
as
regards
time
in
a
good
mechanism
the
aim
is
not
to
play
everything
with
an
equal
sound
but
to
acquire
a
beautiful
quality
of
touch
and
a
perfect
shading
for
a
long
time
players
have
acted
against
nature
in
seeking
to
give
equal
power
to
each
finger
on
the
contrary
each
finger
should
have
an
appropriate
part
assigned
it
the
thumb
has
the
greatest
power
being
the
thickest
finger
and
the
freest
then
comes
the
little
finger
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
hand
the
middle
finger
is
the
main
support
of
the
hand
and
is
assisted
by
the
first
finally
comes
the
third
the
weakest
one
as
to
this
siamese
twin
of
the
middle
finger
some
players
try
to
force
it
with
all
their
might
to
become
independent
a
thing
impossible
and
most
likely
unnecessary
there
are
then
many
different
qualities
of
sound
just
as
there
are
several
fingers
the
point
is
to
utilize
the
differences
and
this
in
other
words
is
the
art
of
fingering
here
it
seems
to
me
is
one
of
the
most
practical
truths
ever
uttered
by
a
teacher
pianists
spend
thousands
of
hours
trying
to
subjugate
impossible
muscles
chopin
who
found
out
most
things
for
himself
saw
the
waste
of
time
and
force
i
recommend
his
advice
he
was
ever
particular
about
fingering
but
his
innovations
horrified
the
purists
play
as
you
feel
was
his
motto
a
rather
dangerous
precept
for
beginners
he
gave
to
his
pupils
the
concertos
and
sonatas
all
carefully
graded
of
mozart
scarlatti
field
dussek
hummel
beethoven
mendelssohn
weber
and
hiller
and
of
schubert
the
pieces
and
dances
liszt
he
did
not
favor
which
is
natural
liszt
having
written
nothing
but
brilliant
paraphrases
in
those
days
the
music
of
the
later
liszt
is
quite
another
thing
chopin
genius
for
the
pedal
his
utilization
of
its
capacity
for
the
vibration
of
related
strings
the
overtones
i
refer
to
later
rubinstein
said
the
piano
bard
the
piano
rhapsodist
the
piano
mind
the
piano
soul
is
chopin
tragic
romantic
lyric
heroic
dramatic
fantastic
soulful
sweet
dreamy
brilliant
grand
simple
all
possible
expressions
are
found
in
his
compositions
and
all
are
sung
by
him
upon
his
instrument
chopin
is
dead
only
fifty
years
but
his
fame
has
traversed
the
half
century
with
ease
and
bids
fair
to
build
securely
in
the
loves
of
our
the
six
letters
that
comprise
his
name
pursue
every
piano
that
is
made
chopin
and
modern
piano
playing
are
inseparable
and
it
is
a
strain
upon
homely
prophecy
to
predict
a
time
when
the
two
shall
be
put
asunder
chopin
was
the
greatest
interpreter
of
chopin
and
following
him
came
those
giants
of
other
days
liszt
tausig
and
rubinstein
while
he
never
had
the
pupils
to
mould
as
had
liszt
chopin
made
some
excellent
piano
artists
they
all
had
or
have
the
old
guard
dies
bravely
his
tradition
but
exactly
what
the
chopin
tradition
is
no
man
may
dare
to
say
anton
rubinstein
when
i
last
heard
him
played
chopin
inimitably
never
shall
i
forget
the
ballades
the
two
polonaises
in
f
sharp
minor
and
a
flat
major
the
b
flat
minor
prelude
the
a
minor
winter
wind
the
two
c
minor
studies
and
the
f
minor
fantasie
yet
the
chopin
pupils
assembled
in
judgment
at
paris
when
he
gave
his
historical
recitals
refused
to
accept
him
as
an
interpreter
his
touch
was
too
rich
and
full
his
tone
too
big
chopin
did
not
care
for
liszt
reading
of
his
music
though
he
trembled
when
he
heard
him
thunder
in
the
eroica
polonaise
i
doubt
if
even
karl
tausig
impeccable
artist
unapproachable
chopin
player
would
have
pleased
the
composer
chopin
played
as
his
moods
prompted
and
his
playing
was
the
despair
and
delight
of
his
hearers
rubinstein
did
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
with
the
coda
of
the
barcarolle
such
a
page
but
sir
charles
halle
said
that
it
was
clever
but
not
chopinesque
yet
halle
heard
chopin
at
his
last
paris
concert
february
play
the
two
forte
passages
in
the
barcarolle
pianissimo
and
with
all
sorts
of
dynamic
finesse
this
is
precisely
what
rubinstein
did
and
his
pianissimo
was
a
whisper
von
bulow
was
too
much
of
a
martinet
to
reveal
the
poetic
quality
though
he
appreciated
chopin
on
the
intellectual
side
his
touch
was
not
beautiful
enough
the
slavic
and
magyar
races
are
your
only
true
chopin
interpreters
witness
liszt
the
magnificent
rubinstein
a
passionate
genius
tausig
who
united
in
his
person
all
the
elements
of
greatness
essipowa
fascinating
and
feminine
the
poetic
paderewski
de
pachmann
the
fantastic
subtle
joseffy
and
rosenthal
a
phenomenon
a
pianist
was
this
frederic
francois
chopin
he
played
as
he
composed
uniquely
all
testimony
is
emphatic
as
to
this
scales
that
were
pearls
a
touch
rich
sweet
supple
and
singing
and
a
technique
that
knew
no
difficulties
these
were
part
of
equipment
as
a
pianist
he
spiritualized
the
timbre
of
his
instrument
until
it
became
transformed
into
something
strange
something
remote
from
its
original
nature
his
pianissimo
was
an
enchanting
whisper
his
forte
seemed
powerful
by
contrast
so
numberless
were
the
gradations
so
widely
varied
his
dynamics
the
fairylike
quality
of
his
play
his
diaphanous
harmonies
his
liquid
tone
his
pedalling
all
were
the
work
of
a
genius
and
a
lifetime
and
the
appealing
humanity
he
infused
into
his
touch
gave
his
listeners
a
delight
that
bordered
on
the
supernatural
so
the
accounts
critical
professional
and
personal
read
there
must
have
been
a
hypnotic
quality
in
his
performances
that
transported
his
audience
wherever
the
poet
willed
indeed
the
stories
told
wear
an
air
of
enthusiasm
that
borders
on
the
exaggerated
on
the
fantastic
crystalline
pearls
falling
on
red
hot
did
scudo
write
this
of
liszt
infinite
nuance
and
the
mingling
of
silvery
bells
these
are
a
few
of
the
least
exuberant
notices
was
it
not
heine
who
called
thalberg
a
king
liszt
a
prophet
chopin
a
poet
herz
an
advocate
kalkbrenner
a
minstrel
madame
pleyel
a
sibyl
and
doehler
a
pianist
the
limpidity
the
smoothness
and
ease
of
playing
were
after
all
on
the
physical
plane
it
was
the
poetic
melancholy
the
grandeur
above
all
the
imaginative
lift
that
were
more
in
evidence
than
mere
sensuous
sweetness
chopin
had
we
know
his
salon
side
when
he
played
with
elegance
brilliancy
and
coquetry
but
he
had
dark
moments
when
the
keyboard
was
too
small
his
ideas
too
big
for
utterance
then
he
astounded
thrilled
his
auditors
they
were
rare
moments
his
was
reproduced
in
his
endless
colorings
and
capricious
rhythms
the
instrument
vibrated
with
these
new
nameless
effects
like
the
violin
in
paganini
hands
it
was
ravishing
he
was
called
the
ariel
the
undine
of
the
piano
there
was
something
imponderable
fluid
vaporous
evanescent
in
his
music
that
eluded
analysis
and
eluded
all
but
critics
this
novelty
was
the
reason
why
he
has
been
classed
as
a
gifted
amateur
and
even
is
he
regarded
by
many
musicians
as
a
skilful
inventor
of
piano
passages
and
patterned
figures
instead
of
what
he
really
is
one
of
the
most
daring
harmonists
since
bach
chopin
elastic
hand
small
thin
with
lightly
articulated
fingers
was
capable
of
stretching
tenths
with
ease
examine
his
first
study
for
confirmation
of
this
his
wrist
was
very
supple
stephen
heller
said
that
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
to
see
chopin
small
hands
expand
and
cover
a
third
of
the
keyboard
it
was
like
the
opening
of
the
mouth
of
a
serpent
about
to
swallow
a
rabbit
whole
he
played
the
octaves
in
the
a
flat
polonaise
with
infinite
ease
but
pianissimo
now
where
is
the
tradition
when
confronted
by
the
mighty
crashing
of
rosenthal
in
this
particular
part
of
the
polonaise
of
karl
tausig
weitzmann
said
that
he
relieved
the
romantically
sentimental
chopin
of
his
weltschmerz
and
showed
him
in
his
pristine
creative
vigor
and
wealth
of
imagination
in
chopin
music
there
are
many
pianists
many
styles
and
all
are
correct
if
they
are
poetically
musical
logical
and
individually
sincere
of
his
rubato
i
treat
in
the
chapter
devoted
to
the
mazurkas
making
also
an
attempt
to
define
the
zal
of
his
playing
and
music
when
chopin
was
strong
he
used
a
pleyel
piano
when
he
was
ill
an
erard
a
nice
fable
of
liszt
he
said
that
he
liked
the
erard
but
he
really
preferred
the
pleyel
with
its
veiled
sonority
what
could
not
he
have
accomplished
with
the
modern
grand
piano
in
the
artist
room
of
the
maison
pleyel
there
stands
the
piano
at
which
chopin
composed
the
preludes
the

the
funeral

as
regards
tone
and

mikuli
asserted
that
chopin
brought
out
an
immense
tone
in
cantabiles
he
had
not
a
small
tone
but
it
was
not
the
orchestral
tone
of
our
day
indeed
how
could
it
be
with
the
light
action
and
tone
of
the
french
pianos
built
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
after
all
it
was
quality
not
quantity
that
chopin
sought
each
one
of
his
ten
fingers
was
a
delicately
differentiated
voice
and
these
ten
voices
could
sing
at
times
like
the
morning

rubinstein
declared
that
all
the
pedal
marks
are
wrong
in
chopin
i
doubt
if
any
edition
can
ever
give
them
as
they
should
be
for
here
again
the
individual
equation
comes
into
play
apart
from
certain
fundamental
rules
for
managing
the
pedals
no
pedagogic
regulations
should
ever
be
made
for
the
more
refined
nuances
the
portraits
of

altogether
a

like
the

interpretation
a
satisfactory
chopin
portrait
is
extremely
rare
as
some
difficulty
was
experienced
in
discovering
the
identity
of
countess
delphine

i
applied
in
to

a

for

he

here
are
the
facts
he
kindly
transmitted
in
three
beautiful
polish
women

to

the
winter
they
were
the
daughters
of
count

of
the
wealthy
count

they
were
singularly
accomplished
they
spoke
half
the
languages
of

drew
well
and
sang
to
perfection
all
they
needed
was
money
to
make
them
queens
of
society
this
they
soon
obtained
and
with
it
high
rank
their
graceful
manners
and
loveliness
won
the
hearts
of
three
of
the
greatest
of
noblemen

to
live
in

and
became
famous
for
their
brilliant
elegance
their
sumptuous
or
palaces
were
thrown
open
to
the
most
prominent
men
of
genius
of
their
time
and
hither
came
chopin
to
meet
not
only
with
the
homage
due
to
his
genius
but
with
a
tender
and
sisterly
friendship
which
proved
one
of
the
greatest
consolations
of
his
life
to
the
amiable
princess
de
beauvau
he
dedicated
his
famous
polonaise
in
f

written
in
the
brilliant
bravura
style

therefore
the
picture
of

the
berlin
gallery
is
not
that
of
chopin
devoted
friend
here
is
another
count
tarnowski
story
it
touches
on
a
potocka
episode
chopin
liked
and
knew
how
to
express
individual
characteristics
on
the
piano
just
as
there
formerly
was
a
rather
fashion
of
describing
dispositions
and
characters
in
which
gave
to
ready
wits
a
scope
for
parading
their
knowledge
of
people
and
their
sharpness
of
observation
so
he
often
amused
himself
by
playing
such
musical
portraits
without
saying
whom
he
had
in
his
thoughts
he
illustrated
the
characters
of
a
few
or
of
several
people
present
in
the
room
and
illustrated
them
so
clearly
and
so
delicately
that
the
listeners
could
always
guess
correctly
who
was
intended
and
admired
the
resemblance
of
the
portrait
one
little
anecdote
is
related
in
connection
with
this
which
throws
some
light
on
his
wit
and
a
little
pinch
of
sarcasm
in
it
during
the
time
of
chopin
greatest
brilliancy
and
popularity
in
the
year
he
once
played
his
musical
portraits
in
a
certain
polish
salon
where
the
three
daughters
of
the
house
were
the
stars
of
the
evening
after
a
few
portraits
had
been
extemporized
one
of
these
ladies
wished
to
have
hers
mme
delphine
potocka
chopin
in
reply
drew
her
shawl
from
her
shoulders
threw
it
on
the
keyboard
and
began
to
play
implying
in
this
two
things
first
that
he
knew
the
character
of
the
brilliant
and
famous
queen
of
fashion
so
well
that
by
heart
and
in
the
dark
he
was
able
to
depict
it
secondly
that
this
character
and
this
soul
is
hidden
under
habits
ornamentations
and
decorations
of
an
elegant
worldly
life
through
the
symbol
of
elegance
and
fashion
of
that
day
as
the
tones
of
the
piano
through
the
shawl
because
chopin
did
not
label
his
works
with
any
but
general
titles
ballades
scherzi
studies
preludes
and
the
like
his
music
sounds
all
the
better
the
listener
is
not
pinned
down
to
any
precise
mood
the
music
being
allowed
to
work
its
particular
charm
without
the
aid
of
literary
crutches
for
unimaginative
minds

to
conjure

perhaps
traceable
to
the

not
reckoned
essential
to

are
considered
only
as

to
the
fancy
of
the
singer
when
the
only
limitations
by
which
the
performer
is
bound
are
the
notes
peculiar
to
that
particular
melody
and
a
strict
regard
to

chopin
founded
no
school
although
the
possibilities
of
the
piano
were
canalized
by
him
in
playing
as
in

only
the
broad

of

may

indeed

for

much

a

school
exists
not
henselt
was
only
a
german
who
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
of
chopin
to
a
euphony
he
has
added
a
technical
figuration
not
unlike
chopin
and
a
spirit
quite
teutonic
in
its
sentimentality
rubinstein
calls
chopin
the
exhalation
of
the
third
epoch
in
art
he
certainly
closed
one
with
a
less
strong
rhythmic
impulse
and
formal
sense
chopin
music
would
have
degenerated
into
mere
overperfumed
impressionism
the
french
piano
school
of
his
day
indeed
of
today
is
entirely
drowned
by
its
devotion
to
cold
decoration
to
unemotional
ornamentation
mannerisms
he
had
what
great
artist
has
not
but
the
greek
in
him
as
in
heine
kept
him
from
formlessness
he
is
seldom
a
landscapist
but
he
can
handle
his
brush
deftly
before
nature
if
he
must
he
paints
atmosphere
the
open
air
at
eventide
with
consummate
skill
and
for
playing
fantastic
tricks
on
your
nerves
in
the
depiction
of
the
superhuman
he
has
a
peculiar
faculty
remember
that
in
chopin
early
days
the
byronic
pose
the
grandiose
and
the
horrible
prevailed
witness
the
pictures
of
ingres
and
delacroix
and
richter
wrote
with
his
saturated
in
moonshine
and
tears
chopin
did
not
altogether
escape
the
artistic
vices
of
his
generation
as
a
man
he
was
a
bit
of
poseur
the
little
whisker
grown
on
one
side
of
his
face
the
side
which
he
turned
to
his
audience
is
a
note
of
foppery
but
was
ever
a
detester
of
the
he
was
sincere
and
his
survival
when
nearly
all
of
mendelssohn
much
of
schumann
and
half
of
berlioz
have
suffered
an
eclipse
is
proof
positive
of
his
vitality
the
fruit
of
his
experimentings
in
tonality
we
see
in
the
whole
school
of
piano
dramatic
and
orchestral
composers
that
chopin
may
lead
to
the
development
and
adoption
of
the
new
enharmonic
scales
the
homotonic
scales
i
do
not
know
for
these
de
bertha
claimed
the
future
of
music
he
wrote
now
vaporously
illumined
by
the
crepuscular
light
of
a
magical
sky
on
the
boundaries
of
the
major
and
minor
modes
now
seeming
to
spring
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
with
sepulchral
inflexions
melody
moves
with
ease
on
the
serried
degrees
of
the
enharmonic
scales
lively
or
slow
she
always
assumed
in
them
the
accents
of
a
fatalist
impossibility
for
the
laws
of
arithmetic
have
preceded
her
and
there
still
remains
as
it
were
an
atmosphere
of
proud
rigidity
melancholy
or
passionate
she
preserves
the
reflected
lines
of
a
primitive
rusticity
which
clings
to
the
homotones
in
despite
of
their
artificial
origin
but
all
this
will
be
in
the
days
to
come
when
the
flat
keyboard
will
be
superseded
by
a
janko
clavier
contrivance
when
krehbiel
oriental
srootis
are
in
use
and
apthorp
nullitonic
order
no
key
at
all
is
invented
then
too
a
new
chopin
may
be
born
but
i
doubt
it
despite
his
idiomatic
treatment
of
the
piano
it
must
be
remembered
that
chopin
under
sontag
and
paganini
influence
imitated
both
voice
and
violin
on
the
keyboard
his
lyricism
is
most
human
while
the
portamento
the
slides
trills
and
indescribably
subtle
turns
are
they
not
of
the
violin
wagner
said
to
dannreuther
see
finck
wagner
and
his
works
that
mozart
music
and
mozart
orchestra
are
a
perfect
match
an
equally
perfect
balance
exists
between
choir
and
palestrina
counterpoint
and
i
find
a
similar
correspondence
between
chopin
piano
and
some
of
his
etudes
and
preludes
i
do
not
care
for
the
ladies
chopin
there
is
too
much
of
the
parisian
salon
in
that
but
he
has
given
us
many
things
which
are
above
the
salon
which
latter
statement
is
slightly
condescending
recollect
however
chopin
calm
depreciation
of
schumann
john
runciman
the
english
critic
asserts
that
chopin
thought
in
terms
of
the
piano
and
only
the
piano
so
when
we
see
chopin
orchestral
music
or
wagner
music
for
the
piano
we
realize
that
neither
is
talking
his
native
tongue
the
tongue
which
nature
fitted
him
to
speak
speaking
of
chopin
and
the
sick
men
runciman
is
most
pertinent
these
inheritors
of
rickets
and
exhausted
physical
frames
made
some
of
the
most
wonderful
music
of
the
century
for
us
schubert
was
the
most
wonderful
of
them
all
but
chopin
runs
him
very
close
he
wrote
less
far
less
than
schubert
wrote
but
for
the
quantity
he
did
write
its
finish
is
miraculous
it
may
be
feverish
merely
mournful
cadavre
or
tranquil
and
entirely
beautiful
but
there
is
not
a
phrase
that
is
not
polished
as
far
as
a
phrase
will
bear
polishing
it
is
marvellous
music
but
all
the
same
it
is
sick
unhealthy
music
liszt
estimate
of
the
technical
importance
of
chopin
works
writes
henderson
is
not
too
large
it
was
chopin
who
systematized
the
art
of
pedalling
and
showed
us
how
to
use
both
pedals
in
combination
to
produce
those
wonderful
effects
of
color
which
are
so
necessary
in
the
performance
of
his
music
the
harmonic
schemes
of
the
simplest
of
chopin
works
are
marvels
of
originality
and
musical
loveliness
and
i
make
bold
to
say
that
his
treatment
of
the
passing
note
did
much
toward
showing
later
writers
how
to
produce
the
restless
and
endless
complexity
of
the
harmony
in
contemporaneous
orchestral
music
heinrich
pudor
in
his
strictures
on
german
music
is
hardly
complimentary
to
chopin
wagner
is
a
decadent
an
an
epigonus
not
a
progonus
his
cheeks
are
hollow
and
pale
but
the
germans
have
the
full
red
cheeks
equally
decadent
is
liszt
liszt
is
a
hungarian
and
the
hungarians
are
confessedly
a
completely
disorganized
dying
people
no
less
decadent
is
chopin
whose
figure
comes
before
one
as
flesh
without
bones
this
morbid
womanly
womanish
powerless
sickly
bleached
pole
this
has
a
ring
of
nietzsche
nietzsche
who
boasted
of
his
polish
origin
now
listen
to
the
fatidical
pole
przybyszewski
in
the
beginning
there
was
sex
out
of
sex
there
was
nothing
and
in
it
everything
was
and
sex
made
itself
brain
whence
was
the
birth
of
the
soul
and
then
as
vance
thompson
who
first
englished
this
mass
of
the
dead
wrote
he
pictures
largely
in
great
cosmic
symbols
decorated
with
passionate
and
mystic
fervors
the
singular
combat
between
the
growing
soul
and
the
sex
from
which
it
fain
would
be
free
arno
holz
thus
parodies
przybyszewski
in
our
soul
there
is
surging
and
singing
a
song
of
the
victorious
bacteria
our
blood
lacks
the
white
corpuscles
on
the
sounding
board
of
our
consciousness
there
echoes
along
the
frightful
symphony
of
the
flesh
it
becomes
objective
in
chopin
he
alone
the
modern
primeval
man
puts
our
brains
on
the
green
meadows
he
alone
thinks
in
dimensions
he
alone
rebuilds
the
shattered
jerusalem
of
our
souls
all
of
which
shows
to
what
comically
delirious
lengths
this
sort
of
deleterious
may
go
it
would
be
well
to
consider
this
word
decadent
and
its
morbid
implications
there
is
a
fashion
just
now
in
criticism
to
the
physical
and
moral
weaknesses
of
the
artist
lombroso
started
the
fashion
nordau
carried
it
to
its
logical
absurdity
yet
it
is
nothing
new
in
hazlitt
day
he
complains
that
genius
is
called
mad
by
foolish
folk
newman
writes
in
his
wagner
that
art
in
general
and
music
in
particular
ought
not
to
be
condemned
merely
in
terms
of
the
physical
degeneration
or
abnormality
of
the
artist
some
of
the
finest
work
in
art
and
literature
indeed
has
been
produced
by
men
who
could
not
from
any
standpoint
be
pronounced
normal
in
the
case
of
flaubert
of
de
maupassant
of
dostoievsky
of
poe
and
a
score
of
others
though
the
organic
system
was
more
or
less
flawed
the
work
remains
touched
with
that
universal
quality
that
gives
artistic
permanence
even
to
perceptions
born
of
the
abnormal
newman
might
have
added
other
names
to
his
list
those
of
michael
angelo
and
beethoven
and
swinburne
really
is
any
great
genius
quite
sane
according
to
philistine
standards
the
answer
must
be
negative
the
old
enemy
has
merely
changed
his
mode
of
attack
instead
of
charging
genius
with
madness
the
abnormal
used
in
an
abnormal
sense
is
lugged
in
and
though
these
imputations
of
degeneracy
moral
and
physical
have
in
some
cases
proven
true
the
genius
of
the
accused
one
can
in
no
wise
be
denied
but
then
as
philip
hale
asks
why
this
timidity
at
being
called
decadent
what
in
the
name
havelock
ellis
in
his
masterly
study
of
joris
karl
huysmans
considers
the
much
misunderstood
phenomenon
in
art
called
decadence
technically
a
decadent
style
is
only
such
in
relation
to
a
classic
style
it
is
simply
a
further
development
of
a
classic
style
a
further
specialization
the
homogeneous
in
spencerian
phraseology
having
become
heterogeneous
the
first
is
beautiful
because
the
parts
are
subordinated
to
the
whole
the
second
is
beautiful
because
the
whole
is
subordinated
to
the
parts
then
he
proceeds
to
show
in
literature
that
sir
thomas
browne
emerson
pater
carlyle
poe
hawthorne
and
whitman
are
decadents
not
in
any
invidious
sense
but
simply
in
the
breaking
up
of
the
whole
for
the
benefit
of
its
parts
nietzsche
is
quoted
to
the
effect
that
in
the
period
of
corruption
in
the
evolution
of
societies
we
are
apt
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
energy
which
in
more
primitive
times
marked
the
operations
of
a
community
as
a
whole
has
now
simply
been
transferred
to
the
individuals
themselves
and
this
aggrandizement
of
the
individual
really
produces
an
even
greater
amount
of
energy
and
further
ellis
all
art
is
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
slopes
of
a
rhythmic
curve
between
these
two
classic
and
decadent
extremes
decadence
suggests
to
us
going
down
falling
decay
if
we
walk
down
a
real
hill
we
do
not
feel
that
we
commit
a
more
wicked
act
than
when
we
walked
up
it
architecture
is
classic
to
become
in
its
byzantine
developments
completely
decadent
and
mark
is
the
perfected
type
of
decadence
in
art
we
have
to
recognize
that
decadence
is
an
aesthetic
and
not
a
moral
conception
the
power
of
words
is
great
but
they
need
not
befool
us
we
are
not
called
upon
to
air
our
moral
indignation
over
the
bass
end
of
the
musical
clef
i
recommend
the
entire
chapter
to
such
men
as
lombroso
levi
max
nordau
and
heinrich
pudor
who
have
yet
to
learn
that
all
confusion
of
intellectual
substances
is
foolish
oscar
bie
states
the
chopin
case
most
excellently
chopin
is
a
poet
it
has
become
a
very
bad
habit
to
place
this
poet
in
the
hands
of
our
youth
the
concertos
and
polonaises
being
put
aside
no
one
lends
himself
worse
to
youthful
instruction
than
chopin
because
his
delicate
touches
inevitably
seem
perverse
to
the
youthful
mind
he
has
gained
the
name
of
a
morbid
genius
the
grown
man
who
understands
how
to
play
chopin
whose
music
begins
where
that
of
another
leaves
off
whose
tones
show
the
supremest
mastery
in
the
tongue
of
music
such
a
man
will
discover
nothing
morbid
in
him
chopin
a
pole
strikes
sorrowful
chords
which
do
not
occur
frequently
to
healthy
normal
persons
but
why
is
a
pole
to
receive
less
justice
than
a
german
we
know
that
the
extreme
of
culture
is
closely
allied
to
decay
for
perfect
ripeness
is
but
the
foreboding
of
corruption
children
of
course
do
not
know
this
and
chopin
himself
would
have
been
much
too
noble
ever
to
lay
bare
his
mental
sickness
to
the
world
and
his
greatness
lies
precisely
in
this
that
he
preserves
the
mean
between
immaturity
and
decay
his
greatness
is
his
aristocracy
he
stands
among
musicians
in
his
faultless
vesture
a
noble
from
head
to
foot
the
sublimest
emotions
toward
whose
refinement
whole
generations
had
tended
the
last
things
in
our
soul
whose
foreboding
is
interwoven
with
the
mystery
of
judgment
day
have
in
his
music
found
their
form
further
on
i
shall
attempt
i
write
the
word
with
a
patibulary
gesture
in
a
sort
of
a
chopin
variorum
to
analyze
the
salient
aspects
technical
and
aesthetic
of
his
music
to
translate
into
prose
into
any
language
no
matter
how
poetical
the
images
aroused
by
his
music
is
impossible
i
am
forced
to
employ
the
technical
terminology
of
other
arts
but
against
my
judgment
read
apthorp
disheartening
dictum
in
by
the
way
the
entrancing
phantasmagoria
of
picture
and
incident
which
we
think
we
see
rising
from
the
billowing
sea
of
music
is
in
reality
nothing
more
than
an
enchanting
fata
morgana
visible
at
no
other
angle
than
that
of
our
own
eye
the
true
gist
of
music
it
never
can
be
it
can
never
truly
translate
what
is
most
essential
and
characteristic
in
its
expression
it
is
but
something
that
we
have
half
unconsciously
imputed
to
music
nothing
that
really
exists
in
music
the
shadowy
miming
of
chopin
soul
has
nevertheless
a
significance
for
this
generation
it
is
now
the
reign
of
the
brutal
the
realistic
the
impossible
in
music
formal
excellence
is
neglected
and
has
reduced
art
to
the
level
of
an
anecdote
chopin
neither
preaches
nor
paints
yet
his
art
is
decorative
and
dramatic
though
in
the
climate
of
the
ideal
he
touches
earth
and
its
emotional
issues
in
poland
only
otherwise
his
music
is
a
pure
aesthetic
delight
an
artistic
enchantment
freighted
with
no
ethical
or
theatric
messages
it
is
poetry
made
audible
the
soul
written
in
sound
all
that
i
can
faintly
indicate
is
the
way
it
affects
me
this
music
with
the
petals
of
a
glowing
rose
and
the
heart
of
gray
ashes
its
analogies
to
poe
verlaine
shelley
keats
heine
and
mickiewicz
are
but
critical
for
chopin
is
incomparable
chopin
is
unique
our
interval
writes
walter
pater
is
brief
few
pass
it
recollectedly
and
with
full
understanding
of
its
larger
rhythms
and
more
urgent
colors
many
endure
it
in
frivol
and
violence
the
majority
in
bored
sullen
submission
chopin
the
new
chopin
is
a
foe
to
ennui
and
the
spirit
that
denies
in
his
exquisite
sweet
we
may
find
rich
impersonal
relief
poet
and

music
is
an
order
of
mystic

a

an

mode
of
motion
it

itself
on
the
formal
side
to
the

its

it
appeals

ribot
admirable

does
not

to

music
as
the
most
emotional
of
the
arts
it
acts
like
a
burn
like

cold
or
a

contact
and
is
the
most
dependent

music
then
the
most
vague
of
the
arts
in
the
matter
of
representing
the
concrete
is
the
swiftest
surest
agent
for
attacking

sensibilities

manifest

it
is
a
cry
that
takes
on
fanciful

each

in

are

the
marriage
of

us
such
old

about

dante
gabriel
rossetti
has
imprisoned
in
a
sonnet
the
almost
intangible
feeling
aroused
by
music
the
feeling
of
having
pursued
in
the
immemorial
past
the
route
of
evanescence
is
it
this
sky
vast
vault
or

that
is
life

my
life
from

my
breath
quailing
on
the
bitter
bound
nay
is
it
life

upon

half

men

rulers
of
musical
emotion
richard
wagner
and
frederic

chopin
the
music
of
the
latter
is
the
most
ravishing
gesture
that
art
has
yet
made
wagner
and
chopin
the
macrocosm
and
the
microcosm
wagner
has
made

his
time
is
the
most
individual
composer
that
has
ever
set
humming
the
looms

wagner

a

in
their
music

is
fiercer
intenser

more
fugacious

frame
of
the
theatre
through
their
intensity
of
conception
and
of
life
both
men
touch
issues
though
widely
dissimilar
in
all
else
chopin
had
greater
melodic
and
as
great
harmonic
genius
as
wagner
he
made
more
themes
he
was
as
rubinstein
wrote
the
last
of
the
original
composers
but
his
scope
was
not
scenic
he
preferred
the
stage
of
his
soul
to
the
windy
spaces
of
the
his
is
the
interior
play
the
eternal
conflict
between
body
and
soul
he
viewed
music
through
his
temperament
and
it
often
becomes
so
imponderable
so
bodiless
as
to
suggest
a
fourth
dimension
in
the
art
space
is
obliterated
with
chopin
one
does
not
get
as
from
beethoven
the
sense
of
spiritual
vastness
of
the
overarching
sublime
there
is
the
pathos
of
spiritual
distance
but
it
is
pathos
not
sublimity
his
soul
was
a
star
and
dwelt
apart
though
not
in
the
miltonic
or
wordsworthian
sense
a
tenuity
at
times
wings
his
thought
and
he
is
the
creator
of
a
new
thrill
within
the
thrill
the
charm
of
the
dying
fall
the
unspeakable
cadence
of
regret
for
the
love
that
is
dead
is
in
his
music
like
john
keats
he
sometimes
sees
charm
magic
casements
opening
on
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
faery
lands
forlorn
chopin
psychologist
is
more
kin
to
keats
than
shelley
he
is
a
greater
artist
than
a
thinker
his
philosophy
is
of
the
beautiful
as
was
keats
and
while
he
lingers
by
the
river
edge
to
catch
the
song
of
the
reeds
his
gaze
is
oftener
fixed
on
the
quiring
planets
he
is
nature
most
exquisite
and
vibrates
to
her
with
intensity
color
and
vivacity
that
have
no
parallel
stained
with
melancholy
his
joy
is
never
that
of
the
strong
man
rejoicing
in
his
muscles
yet
his
very
tenderness
is
tonic
and
his
cry
is
ever
restrained
by
an
attic
sense
of
proportion
like
alfred
de
vigny
he
dwelt
in
a
tour
that
faced
the
west
and
for
him
the
sunrise
was
not
but
o
the
miraculous
moons
he
discovered
the
sunsets
and
his
notes
cast
great
rich
shadows
these
chains
of
drenched
in
the
dew
of
beauty
pompeian
colors
are
too
restricted
and
flat
he
divulges
a
world
of
some
enfolding
sunny
spots
of
greenery
or
singing
in
silvery
shade
the
song
of
chromatic
ecstasy
others
huge
fragments
vaulted
like
rebounding
hail
and
black
upon
black
chopin
is
the
color
genius
of
the
piano
his
eye
was
attuned
to
hues
the
most
fragile
and
attenuated
he
can
weave
harmonies
that
are
as
ghostly
as
a
lunar
rainbow
and
in
their
libration
are
some
of
his
melodies
glimpses
mysterious
and
vast
as
of
a
strange
world
his
utterances
are
always
dynamic
and
he
emerges
betimes
as
if
from
goya
tomb
and
etches
with
sardonic
finger
nada
in
dust
but
this
spirit
of
denial
is
not
an
abiding
mood
chopin
throws
a
net
of
tone
over
souls
wearied
with
rancors
and
revolts
bridges
salty
estranged
seas
of
misery
and
presently
we
are
viewing
a
mirrored
a
fabulous
universe
wherein
death
is
dead
and
love
reigns
lord
of
all
ii
heine
said
that
every
epoch
is
a
sphinx
which
plunges
into
the
abyss
as
soon
as
its
problem
is
solved
born
in
the
very
upheaval
of
the
romantic
revolution
a
revolution
evoked
by
the
intensity
of
its
emotion
rather
than
by
the
power
of
its
ideas
chopin
was
not
altogether
one
of
the
insurgents
of
art
just
when
his
individual
soul
germinated
who
may
tell
in
his
early
music
are
discovered
the
roots
and
fibres
of
hummel
and
field
his
growth
involuntary
inevitable
put
forth
strange
sprouts
and
he
saw
in
the
piano
an
instrument
of
two
dimensions
a
third
and
so
his
music
deepened
and
took
on
stranger
colors
the
keyboard
had
never
sung
so
before
he
forged
its
formula
a
new
apocalyptic
seal
of
melody
and
harmony
was
let
fall
upon
it
sounding
scrolls
delicious
arabesques
gorgeous
in
tint
martial
lyric
a
resonance
of
emerald
a
sobbing
of
fountains
as
that
chopin
of
the
gutter
paul
verlaine
has
it
the
tear
crystallized
midway
an
arrested
pearl
were
overheard
in
his
music
and
europe
felt
a
new
shudder
of
sheer
delight
the
literary
quality
is
absent
and
so
is
the
ethical
chopin
may
prophesy
but
he
never
flames
into
the
divers
tongues
of
the
upper
heaven
compared
with
his
passionate
abandonment
to
the
dance
brahms
is
the
of
music
the
great
infant
born
with
gray
hair
and
with
the
slow
smile
of
childhood
chopin
seldom
smiles
and
while
some
of
his
music
is
young
he
does
not
raise
in
the
mind
pictures
of
the
fatuous
romance
of
youth
his
passion
is
mature
and
never
at
a
loss
for
the
mot
propre
and
with
what
marvellous
vibration
he
gamuts
the
passions
festooning
them
with
carnations
and
great
white
tube
roses
but
the
dark
dramatic
motive
is
never
lost
in
the
decorative
wiles
of
this
magician
as
the
man
grew
he
laid
aside
his
pretty
garlands
and
his
line
became
sterner
its
traceries
more
gothic
he
made
bach
his
chief
god
and
within
the
woven
walls
of
his
strange
harmonies
he
sings
the
history
of
a
soul
a
soul
convulsed
by
antique
madness
by
the
memory
of
awful
things
a
soul
lured
by
beauty
to
secret
glades
wherein
sacrificial
rites
are
performed
to
the
solemn
sounds
of
unearthly
music
like
maurice
de
guerin
chopin
perpetually
strove
to
decipher
beauty
enigma
and
passionately
demanded
of
the
sphinx
that
defies
upon
the
shores
of
what
oceans
have
they
rolled
the
stone
that
hides
them
o
macareus
his
name
was
as
the
stroke
of
a
bell
to
the
romancists
he
remained
aloof
from
them
though
in
a
sympathetic
attitude
the
classic
is
but
the
romantic
dead
said
an
acute
critic
chopin
was
a
classic
without
knowing
it
he
compassed
for
the
dances
of
his
land
what
bach
did
for
the
older
forms
with
heine
he
led
the
spirit
of
revolt
but
enclosed
his
note
of
agitation
in
a
frame
beautiful
the
color
the
lithe
perpetual
escape
from
the
formal
deceived
his
critics
schumann
among
the
rest
chopin
like
flaubert
was
the
last
of
the
idealists
the
first
of
the
realists
the
newness
of
his
form
his
linear
counterpoint
misled
the
critics
who
accused
him
of
the
lack
of
it
schumann
formal
deficiency
detracts
from
much
of
his
music
and
because
of
their
formal
genius
wagner
and
chopin
will
live
to
chopin
might
be
addressed
sar
merodack
peladan
words
when
your
hand
writes
a
perfect
line
the
cherubim
descend
to
find
pleasure
therein
as
in
a
mirror
chopin
wrote
many
perfect
lines
he
is
above
all
the
faultless
lyrist
the
swinburne
the
master
of
fiery
many
rhythms
the
chanter
of
songs
before
sunrise
of
the
burden
of
the
flesh
the
sting
of
desire
and
lays
of
passionate
freedom
his
music
is
to
quote
thoreau
a
proud
sweet
satire
on
the
meanness
of
our
life
he
had
no
feeling
for
the
epic
his
genius
was
too
concentrated
and
though
he
could
be
furiously
dramatic
the
sustained
majesty
of
blank
verse
was
denied
him
with
musical
ideas
he
was
ever
gravid
but
their
intensity
is
parent
to
their
brevity
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
with
chopin
the
form
was
conditioned
by
the
idea
he
took
up
the
dancing
patterns
of
poland
because
they
suited
his
vivid
inner
life
he
transformed
them
idealized
them
attaining
to
more
prolonged
phraseology
and
denser
architecture
in
his
ballades
and
scherzi
but
these
periods
are
passionate
never
philosophical
all
artists
are
androgynous
in
chopin
the
feminine
often
prevails
but
it
must
be
noted
that
this
quality
is
a
distinguishing
sign
of
masculine
lyric
genius
for
when
he
unbends
coquets
and
makes
graceful
confessions
or
whimpers
in
lyric
loveliness
at
fate
then
his
sex
peeps
out
a
picture
of
the
capricious
beautiful
tyrannical
polish
woman
when
he
stiffens
his
soul
when
russia
gets
into
his
nostrils
then
the
smoke
and
flame
of
his
polonaises
the
tantalizing
despair
of
his
mazurkas
are
testimony
to
the
strong
in
rebellion
but
it
is
often
a
psychical
masquerade
the
sag
of
melancholy
is
soon
felt
and
the
old
chopin
the
subjective
chopin
wails
afresh
in
melodic
moodiness
that
he
could
attempt
far
flights
one
may
see
in
his
b
flat
minor
sonata
in
his
scherzi
in
several
of
the
ballades
above
all
in
the
f
minor
fantasie
in
this
great
work
the
technical
invention
keeps
pace
with
the
inspiration
it
coheres
there
is
not
a
flaw
in
the
reverberating
marble
not
a
rift
in
the
idea
if
chopin
diseased
to
death
door
could
erect
such
a
palace
of
dreams
what
might
not
he
have
dared
had
he
been
healthy
but
forth
from
his
misery
came
sweetness
and
strength
like
honey
from
the
lion
he
grew
amazingly
the
last
ten
years
of
his
existence
grew
with
a
promise
that
recalls
keats
shelley
mozart
schubert
and
the
rest
of
the
early
slaughtered
angelic
crew
his
spirit
waxed
and
waned
in
the
gusty
surprises
of
a
disappointed
life
to
the
earth
for
consolation
he
bent
his
ear
and
caught
echoes
of
the
cosmic
comedy
the
laughter
of
the
hills
the
lament
of
the
sea
and
the
mutterings
of
its
depths
these
things
with
tales
of
sombre
clouds
and
shining
skies
and
whisperings
of
strange
creatures
dancing
timidly
in
pavonine
twilights
he
traced
upon
the
ivory
keys
of
his
instrument
and
the
world
was
richer
for
a
poet
chopin
is
not
only
the
poet
of
the
piano
he
is
also
the
poet
of
music
the
most
poetic
of
composers
compared
with
him
bach
seems
a
maker
of
solid
polyphonic
prose
beethoven
a
scooper
of
stars
a
master
of
growling
storms
mozart
a
weaver
of
gay
tapestries
schumann
a
divine
stammerer
schubert
alone
of
all
the
composers
resembles
him
in
his
lyric
prodigality
both
were
masters
of
melody
but
chopin
was
the
of
the
two
and
polished
after
bending
and
beating
his
theme
fresh
from
the
fire
of
his
forge
he
knew
that
to
complete
his
wailing
iliads
the
strong
hand
of
the
reviser
was
necessary
and
he
also
realized
that
nothing
is
more
difficult
for
the
genius
than
to
retain
his
gift
of
all
natures
the
most
prone
to
pessimism
procrastination
and
vanity
the
artist
is
most
apt
to
become
ennuied
it
is
not
easy
to
flame
always
at
the
focus
to
burn
fiercely
with
the
central
fire
chopin
knew
this
and
cultivated
his
ego
he
saw
too
that
the
love
of
beauty
for
beauty
sake
was
fascinating
but
led
to
the
way
called
madness
so
he
rooted
his
art
gave
it
the
earth
of
poland
and
its
deliquescence
is
put
off
to
the
day
when
a
new
system
of
musical
aestheticism
will
have
routed
the
old
when
the
ugly
shall
be
king
and
melody
the
handmaiden
of
science
but
until
that
most
grievous
and
undesired
time
he
will
catch
the
music
of
our
souls
and
give
it
cry
and
flesh
iii
chopin
is
the
open
door
in
music
besides
having
been
a
poet
and
giving
vibratory
expression
to
the
concrete
he
was
something
else
he
was
a
pioneer
pioneer
because
in
youth
he
had
bowed
to
the
tyranny
of
the
diatonic
scale
and
savored
the
illicit
joys
of
the
chromatic
it
is
briefly
curious
that
chopin
is
regarded
purely
as
a
poet
among
musicians
and
not
as
a
practical
musician
they
will
swear
him
a
phenomenal
virtuoso
but
your
musician
orchestral
and
theoretical
raises
the
eyebrow
of
the
supercilious
if
chopin
is
called
creative
a
cunning
a
moulder
of
decorative
patterns
a
master
at
making
new
figures
all
this
is
granted
but
speak
of
chopin
as
in
the
harmonic
forest
that
true
forest
of
numbers
as
the
forger
of
a
melodic
metal
the
sweetest
purest
in
temper
and
lo
you
are
regarded
as
one
mentally
askew
chopin
invented
many
new
harmonic
devices
he
untied
the
chord
that
was
restrained
within
the
octave
leading
it
into
the
dangerous
but
delectable
land
of
extended
harmonies
and
how
he
chromaticized
the
prudish
rigid
garden
of
german
harmony
how
he
moistened
it
with
flashing
changeful
waters
until
it
grew
bold
and
brilliant
with
promise
a
french
theorist
albert
lavignac
calls
chopin
a
product
of
the
german
romantic
school
this
is
hitching
the
star
to
the
wagon
chopin
influenced
schumann
it
can
be
proven
a
hundred
times
and
schumann
understood
chopin
else
he
could
not
have
written
the
chopin
of
the
carneval
which
quite
chopin
chopin
is
the
musical
soul
of
poland
he
incarnates
its
political
passion
first
a
slav
by
adoption
a
parisian
he
is
the
open
door
because
he
admitted
into
the
west
eastern
musical
ideas
eastern
tonalities
rhythms
in
fine
the
slavic
all
that
is
objectionable
decadent
and
dangerous
he
inducted
europe
into
the
mysteries
and
seductions
of
the
orient
his
music
lies
wavering
between
the
east
and
the
west
a
neurotic
man
his
tissues
trembling
his
sensibilities
aflame
the
offspring
of
a
nation
doomed
to
pain
and
partition
it
was
quite
natural
for
him
to
go
to
france
poland
had
ever
been
her
historical
client
the
france
that
overheated
all
europe
chopin
born
after
two
revolutions
the
true
child
of
insurrection
chose
paris
for
his
second
home
revolt
sat
easily
upon
his
inherited
aristocratic
instincts
no
proletarian
is
quite
so
thorough
a
revolutionist
as
the
born
aristocrat
witness
nietzsche
and
chopin
in
the
bloodless
battle
of
the
romantics
in
the
silent
warring
of
slav
against
teuton
gaul
and
will
ever
stand
as
the
protagonist
of
the
artistic
drama
all
that
followed
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
boundaries
on
the
musical
map
is
due
to
chopin
a
pioneer
he
has
been
rewarded
as
such
by
a
polite
ignorement
or
bland
condescension
he
smashed
the
portals
of
the
convention
that
forbade
a
man
baring
his
soul
to
the
multitude
the
psychology
of
music
is
the
gainer
thereby
chopin
like
velasquez
could
paint
single
figures
perfectly
but
to
great
massed
effects
he
was
a
stranger
wagner
did
not
fail
to
profit
by
his
marvellously
drawn
chopin
taught
his
century
the
pathos
of
patriotism
and
showed
grieg
the
value
of
national
ore
he
practically
the
harmonic
charts
he
gave
voice
to
the
individual
himself
a
product
of
a
nation
dissolved
by
overwrought
individualism
as
schumann
assures
us
his
is
the
proudest
and
most
poetic
spirit
of
his
time
chopin
subdued
by
his
familiar
demon
was
a
true
specimen
of
nietzsche
ubermensch
which
is
but
oversoul
shorn
of
her
wings
chopin
transcendental
scheme
of
technics
is
the
image
of
a
supernormal
lift
in
composition
he
sometimes
robs
music
of
its
corporeal
vesture
and
his
transcendentalism
lies
not
alone
in
his
striving
after
strange
tonalities
and
rhythms
but
in
seeking
the
emotionally
recondite
ever
a
dweller
on
the
threshold
he
saw
visions
that
outshone
the
glories
of
hasheesh
and
his
soul
ground
in
its
mills
exceeding
fine
music
his
vision
is
of
beauty
he
persistently
groped
at
the
hem
of
her
robe
but
never
sought
to
transpose
or
to
tone
the
commonplace
of
life
for
this
he
reproved
schubert
such
intensity
can
not
be
purchased
but
at
the
cost
of
breadth
of
sanity
and
his
picture
of
life
is
not
so
high
wide
sublime
or
awful
as
beethoven
yet
is
it
just
as
inevitable
sincere
and
as
tragically
poignant
stanislaw
przybyszewski
in
his
zur
psychologie
des
individuums
approaches
the
morbid
chopin
the
chopin
who
threw
open
to
the
world
the
east
who
waved
his
chromatic
wand
to
liszt
tschaikowsky
goldmark
rubinstein
richard
strauss
dvorak
and
all
russia
with
its
consonantal
composers
this
polish
psychologist
a
fulgurant
expounder
of
nietzsche
finds
in
chopin
faith
and
mania
the
true
stigma
of
the
mad
individualist
the
individual
who
in
the
first
instance
is
naught
but
an
oxidation
apparatus
nietzsche
and
chopin

individualities
of
the
age
he
forgets
wagner
chopin
himself
the
finest
flowering
of
a
morbid
and
rare
culture
his
music
is
a
series
of
psychoses
he
has
the
sehnsucht
of
a
marvellously
constituted
nature
and
the
shrill
dissonance
of
his
nerves
as
seen
in
the
physiological
outbursts
of
the
b
minor
scherzo
is
the
agony
of
a
tortured
soul
the
piece
is
chopin
iliad
in
it
are
the
ghosts
that
lurk
near
the
hidden
alleys
of
the
soul
but
here
come
out
to

exult
horla
the
horla
of
guy
de
maupassant
the
sinister
doppelganger
of
mankind
which
races
with
him
to
the
goal
of
eternity
perhaps
to
outstrip
and
master
him
in
the
next
evolutionary
cycle
master
as
does
man
the
brute
creation
this
horla
according
to
przybyszewski
conquered
chopin
and
became
vocal
in
his
music
this
horla
has
mastered
nietzsche
who
quite
mad
gave
the
world
that
bible
of
the
ubermensch
that
dancing
lyric
also

zarathustra
nietzsche
disciple
is
half
right
chopin
moods
are
often
morbid
his
music
often
pathological
beethoven
too
is
morbid
but
in
his
kingdom
so
vast
so
varied
the
mood
is
lost
or
lightly
felt
while
in
chopin
province
it
looms
a
maleficent
with
flowers
of
evil
and
its
leaves
glistering
with
sensuousness
but
so
keen
for
symmetry
for
all
the
term
formal
beauty
implies
is
chopin
that
seldom
does
his
morbidity
madden
his
voluptuousness
poison
his
music
has
its
morass
but
also
its
upland
where
the
gale
blows
strong
and
true
perhaps
all
art
is
as
the
incorrigible
nordau
declares
a
slight
deviation
from
the
normal
though
ribot
scoffs
at
the
existence
of
any
standard

chopin
has
surprised
the
musical
malady
of
the
century
he
is
its
chief
spokesman
after
the
vague
mad
noble
dreams
of
byron
shelley
and
napoleon
the
awakening
found
those
disillusioned
souls
wagner
nietzsche
and
chopin
wagner
sought
in
the
epical
rehabilitation
of
a
vanished
valhalla
a
surcease
from
the
he
consciously
selected
his
anodyne
and
in
die
meistersinger
touched
a
consoling
earth
chopin
and
nietzsche
temperamentally
finer
and
more
sensitive
than
wagner
the
one
musically
the
other
intellectually
sang
themselves
in
music
and
philosophy
because
they
were
so
constituted
their
nerves
rode
them
to
their
death
neither
found
the
serenity
and
repose
of
wagner
for
neither
was
as
sane
and
both
suffered
mortally
from
hyperaesthesia
the
penalty
of
all
sick
genius
chopin
music
is
the
aesthetic
symbol
of
a
personality
nurtured
on
patriotism
pride
and
love
that
it
is
better
expressed
by
the
piano
is
because
of
that
instrument
idiosyncrasies
of
evanescent
tone
sensitive
touch
and
wide
range
in
dynamics
it

he
extorted

they

ineffable
and

both

endure
because
of
their
brave
sincerity
their

the

was
the
other
way
as
three
concert
studies
show
not
to

other

when
chopin
arrived
in

his

had

he

yet
both

this
is
a
significant
fact
and
shows
that
little
reliance
can
be
placed
on
the
brave
talk
about

had
the
assistance
of
a
half

pupils

in
addition
ferdinand

can
not
agree
then
upon
what
foundation
are
reared
the
structures
of
the
modern
critical
editions
the
early
french
german
and
polish
editions
are
faulty
indeed
useless
because
of
misprints
and
errata
of
all
kinds
every
succeeding
edition
has
cleared
away
some
of
these
errors
but
only
in
karl
klindworth
has
chopin
found
a
worthy
though
not
faultless
editor
his
edition
is
a
work
of
genius
and
was
called
by
von
bulow
the
only
model
edition
in
a
few
sections
others
such
as
kullak
hugo
riemann
and
hans
von

may
have
outstripped
him
but
as
a
whole
his
editing
is
amazing
for
its
exactitude
scholarship
fertility
in
novel
fingerings
and
sympathetic
insight
in
phrasing

the

should
keep
at
hand
because
of
the
possible
freedom
from
impurities
in
his
text
but
of
phrasing
or
fingering
he
contributes
little
it
must
be
remembered
that
with
the
studies
while
they
completely
exhibit
the
entire
range
of
chopin
genius
the
play

thing
after

the
poetry
the
passion
of
the
ballades
and

problems
like

skein
with
the
modern
avidity
for
exterior
as
well
as
interior
analysis
mikuli

little
sympathy
it
is
then
from
the
masterly
editing
of
kullak
von
bulow
riemann
and
klindworth
that
i
shall
draw
copiously
they
have
in
their
various
ways
given
us
a
clue
to
their
musical
individuality
as
well
as
their
precise
scholarship
klindworth
is
the
most
genially
intellectual
von
bulow
the
most
pedagogic
and
kullak
is
poetic
while
riemann
is
scholarly
the
latter
gives
more
attention
to
phrasing
than
to
fingering
the
chopin
studies
are
poems
fit
for
parnassus
yet
they
also
serve
a
very
useful
purpose
in
pedagogy
both
aspects
the
material
and
the
spiritual
should
be
studied
and
with
four
such
guides
the
student
need
not
go
astray
in
the
first
study
of
the
first
book
op
dedicated
to
liszt
chopin
at
a
leap
reached
new
land
extended
chords
had
been
sparingly
used
by
hummel
and
clementi
but
to
take
a
dispersed
harmony
and
transform
it
into
an
epical
study
to
raise
the
chord
of
the
tenth
to
heroic
stature
that
could
have
been
accomplished
by
chopin
only
and
this
first
study
in
c
is
heroic
theodore
kullak
writes
of
it
above
a
ground
bass
proudly
and
boldly
striding
along
flow
mighty
waves
of
sound
the
etude
whose
technical
end
is
the
rapid
execution
of
widely
extended
chord
figurations
exceeding
the
span
of
an
octave
is
to
be
played
on
the
basis
of
forte
throughout
with
sharply
dissonant
harmonies
the
forte
is
to
be
increased
to
fortissimo
diminishing
again
with
consonant
ones
pithy
accents
their
effect
is
enhanced
when
combined
with
an
elastic
recoil
of
the
hand
the
irregular
black
ascending
and
descending
staircases
of
notes
strike
the
neophyte
with
terror
like
piranesi
marvellous
aerial
architectural
dreams
these
dizzy
acclivities
and
descents
of
chopin
exercise
a
charm
hypnotic
if
you
will
for
eye
as
well
as
ear
here
is
the
new
technique
in
all
its
nakedness
new
in
the
sense
of
figure
design

a
harmonic
way

old
order

and
a
little
frightened
a
man
who
could
explode
a
mine
that
assailed
the
stars
must
be
reckoned
with
the
nub
of
modern
piano
music
is
in
the
study
the
most
formally
reckless
chopin
ever
penned
kullak
gives
chopin
favorite
metronome
sign
to
the
quarter
but
this
editor
rightly
believes
that
the
majestic
grandeur
is
impaired
and
suggests
instead
the
gain
is
at
once
apparent
indeed
kullak
a
man
of
moderate
pulse
is
quite
right
in
his
strictures
on
the
chopin
tempi
tempi
that
sprang
from
the
expressively
light
mechanism
of
the
prevailing
pianos
of
chopin
day
von
bulow
declares
that
the
requisite
suppleness
of
the
hand
in
gradual
extension
and
rapid
contraction
will
be
most
quickly
attained
if
the
player
does
not
disdain
first
of
all
to
impress
on
the
individual
fingers
the
chord
which
is
the
foundation
of
each
arpeggio
a
sound
pedagogic
point
he
also
inveighs
against
the
disposition
to
play
the
octave
basses

in
fact
those
basses
are
the
argument
of
the
play
they
must
be
granitic
ponderable
and
powerful

authority
calls
attention
to
a
misprint

which

makes

in

von
bulow
gives
the
chopin
metronomic
marking
it
remained
for
riemann
to
make
some
radical
changes
this
learned
and
worthy
doctor
astonished
the
musical
world
a
few
years
by
his
new
marks
of
phrasing
in
the
beethoven
symphonies
they
the
old
bowing
with
chopin
new
dynamic
and
agogic
accents
are
rather
dangerous
at
least
to
the
peace
of
mind
of
worshippers
of
the
chopin
fetish
riemann
breaks
two
bars
into
one
it
is
a
finished
period
for
him
and
by
detaching
several
of
the
sixteenths
in
the
first
group
the
first
and
fourth
he
makes
the
accent
clearer
at
least
to
the
eye
he
indicates
alla
breve
with
to
the
half
in
later
studies
examples
will
be
given
of
this
phrasing
a
phrasing
that
becomes
a
mannerism
with
the
editor
he
offers
no
startling
finger
changes
the
value
of
his
criticism
throughout
the
volume
seems
to
be
in
the
phrasing
and
this
by
no
means
conforms
to
accepted
notions
of
how
chopin
should
be
interpreted
i
intend
quoting
more
freely
from
riemann
than
from
the
others
but
not
for
the
reason
that
i
consider
him
as
a
cloud
by
day
and
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
in
the
desirable
land
of
the
chopin
fitudes
rather
because
his
piercing
analysis
lays
bare
the
very
roots
of
these
shining
examples
of
piano
literature
klindworth
contents
himself
with
a
straightforward
version
of
the
c
major
study
his
fingering
being
the
clearest
and
most
admirable
the
mikuli
edition
makes
one
addition
it
is
a
line
which
binds
the
last
note
of
the
first
group
to
the
first
of
the
second
the
device
is
useful
and
occurs
only
on
the
upward
flights
of
the
arpeggio
this
study
suggests
that
its
composer
wished
to
begin
the
exposition
of
his
wonderful
technical
system
with
a
skeletonized
statement
it
is
the
tree
stripped
of
its
bark
the
flower
of
its
leaves
yet
austere
as
is
the
result
there
is
compensating
power
dignity
and
unswerving
logic
this
study
is
the
key
with
which
chopin
unlocked
not
his
heart
but
the
kingdom
of
technique
it
should
be
played
for
variety
unisono
with
both
hands
omitting
of
course
the
octave
bass
von
bulow
writes
cannily
enough
that
the
second
study
in
a
minor
being
chromatically
related
to
moscheles
etude
op
no
that
piece
should
prepare
the
way
for
chopin
more
musical
composition
in
different
degrees
of
tempo
strength
and
rhythmic
accent
it
should
be
practised
omitting

von

the

as

and
riemann
is
to
the
half
with
an
alla

the
fingering

of
these
authorities
is
almost
identical

ideas
of

in

von

orders
the
middle
harmonies
to
be
played
throughout
distinctly
and
yet
transiently
in
german
fluchtig
in
fact
the
entire
composition
with
its
murmuring
meandering
chromatic
character
is
a
forerunner
to
the
whispering
weaving
moonlit
effects
in
some
of
his
later
studies
the
technical
purpose
is
clear
but
not
obtrusive
it
is
intended
for
the
fourth
and
fifth
finger
of
the
right
hand
but
given
in
unison
with
both
hands
it
becomes
a
veritable
but
laudable
torture
for
the
thumb
of
the
left
with
the
repeat
of
the
first
at

von
bulow
gives
a
variation
in
fingering
method
of
fingering
is
this
everywhere
that
two
white
keys
occur
in
succession
the
fifth
finger
is
to
be
used
for
c
and
f
in
the
right
hand
and
for
f
and
e
in
the
left
he
has
also
something
to
say
about
holding
the
hand
sideways
so
that
the
back
of
the
hand
and
arm
form
an
angle
this
question
of
hand
position
particularly
in
chopin
is
largely
a
matter
of
individual
formation
no
two
hands
are
alike
no
two
pianists
use
the
same
muscular
movements
play
along
the
easiest
line
of
resistance
we
now
have
reached
a
study
the
third
in
which
the
more
intimately
known
chopin
reveals
himself
this
one
in
e
is
among
the
finest
flowering
of
the
composer
choice

it
is
simpler
less
morbid
sultry
and
languorous
therefore
saner
than
the
much
bepraised
study
in
c
sharp
minor
no
op
niecks
writes
that
this
study
may
be
counted
among
chopin
loveliest
compositions
it
combines
classical
chasteness
of
contour
with
the
fragrance
of
romanticism
chopin
told
his
faithful
gutmann
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
written
another
such
melody
and
once
when
hearing
it
raised
his
arms
aloft
and
cried
out
oh
ma
patrie
i
can
not
vouch
for
the
sincerity
of
chopin
utterance
for
as
runciman
writes
they
were
a
very
byronic
set
these
young
men
and
they
took
themselves
with
ludicrous
seriousness
von
bulow
calls
it
a
study
in
expression
which
is
obvious
and
thinks
it
should
be
studied
in
company
with
no
in
e
flat
minor
this
reason
is
not
patent
emotions
should
not
be
hunted
in
couples
and
the
very
object
of
the
collection
variety
in
mood
as
well
as
mechanism
is
thus
defeated
but
von
bulow
was
ever
an
ardent
classifier
perhaps
he
had
his
soul
compartmentized
he
also
attempts
to
regulate
the
rubato
this
is
the
first
of
the
studies
wherein
the
rubato
rights
must
be
acknowledged
the
bars
are
even
mentioned
and
where
tempo
license
may
be
indulged
but
here
is
a
case
which
innate
taste
and
feeling
must
guide
you
can
no
more
teach
a
real
chopin
rubato
not
the
mawkish
imitation
than
you
can
make
a
donkey
comprehend
kant
the
metronome

the
same
in
all

the

kullak
rightly
calls
this
lovely

more
in

he
gives
in
the

an
alternate

not
touch
this
piece
unless
they
can
grapple
the

the

what
a
joy
is
the
next
study
no
how
well
chopin
knew
the
value
of
contrast
in
tonality
and
sentiment
a
veritable
classic
is
this
piece
which
despite
its
dark
key
color
c
sharp

as
a
foil
to
the
preceding
one
in
e
bubbles
with

and

flame
it
reminds
one
of
the
story
of
the
polish
peasants
who
are
happiest
when
they
sing
in
the

mode
kullak
calls
this
a
bravura
study
for
velocity
and
lightness
in
both
hands

fiery
while
von
bulow
believes
that
the
irresistible
interest
inspired
by
the
spirited
content
of
this
truly
classical
and
model
piece
of
music
may
become
a
stumbling
block
in
attempting
to
conquer
the
technical
difficulties
hardly
the
technics
of
this
composition
do
not
lie
beneath
the
surface
they
are
very
much
in
the
way
of
clumsy
fingers
and
heavy

presto

the

in

klindworth
does
not
comment
but
i
like
his
fingering
and
phrasing
best
of
all
riemann
repeats
his
trick
of
breaking
a
group
detaching
a
note
for
emphasis
although
he
is
careful
to
retain
the
legato
bow
one
wonders
why
this
study
does
not
figure
more
frequently
on
programmes
of
piano
recitals
it
is
a
fine
healthy
technical
test
it
is
brilliant
and
the
coda
is
very
dramatic
ten
bars
before
the
return
of
the
theme
there
is
a
stiff
digital
hedge
for
the
student
a
veritable
lance
of
tone
is
this
study
if
justly
poised
riemann
has
his
own
ideas
of
the
phrasing

von
bulow
would
have
grown
jealous
if
he
had
seen
this
rather
fantastic
phrasing
it
is
a
trifle
too
finical
though
it
must
be
confessed
looks
pretty
i
like
longer

phrasing
the
student
may
profit
by
this
analysis
the
piece
is
indeed
as
kullak
says
full
of
polish
elegance
von
bulow
speaks
rather
disdainfully
of
it
as
a
etude
it
is
certainly
graceful
delicately
witty
a
trifle
naughty
arch
and
roguish
and
it
is
delightfully
invented
technically
it

full
of

the

is
ingenious
but
subordinated
to
the
theme
in
the

the

broadens
to
dramatic
vigor
chopin
was
not
yet
the
slave
of
his
mood
there
must
be
a
psychical
programme
to
this
study
some
record
of
a
youthful
disillusion
but
the
expression
of
it
is
kept
well
within
chaste
lines
the
sarmatian
composer
had
not
yet
unlearned
the
value
of
reserve
the
klindworth
reading
of
this
troubled

is
the
best
though

used

a

we
emerge
into

in
the

it
is
a
genuine
toccata
with
moments
of
tender

serving
a
distinct
technical
purpose
the
study
of
double

changing
on

and
is
as
healthy
as
the

here
is
a
brave
an
undaunted
chopin
a
gay
cavalier
with
the
sunshine
shimmering
about
him
there
are
times
when
this

seems
like
light
dripping
through
the
trees
of
a
mysterious
forest
with
the
delicato
there
are
rustlings
and
all
the
while
the

without

is
exercising

while
riemann
in

sees
his
logic
rather
than
hears

von
bulow
plastically
reproduces
the
flitting
elusive
character
of
the
study
far
better
than
the
others
it
is
quite
like
him
to
suggest
to
the
panting
and
ambitious
pupil
that
the
performance
in
f
sharp
major
with
the
same
fingering
as
the
next
study
in
f
no
would
be
beneficial
it
certainly
would
by
the
same
token
the
playing
of
the
f
minor
sonata
the
appassionata
of
beethoven
in
the
key
of
f
sharp
minor
might
produce
good
results
this
was
another
crotchet
of
wagner
friend
and
probably
was
born
of
the
story
that
beethoven
transposed
the
bach
fugues
in
all
keys
the
same
is
said
of
in
his
notes
to
the

theodor
kullak
expatiates
at
length
upon
his
favorite
idea
that
chopin
must
not
be
played
according
to

markings
the

gives
to

the
tellefsen
edition
klindworth
von
bulow
mikuli
and
riemann
the
same
kullak
takes
the
slower
tempo
of
klindworth
believing
that
the
old
herz
and
czerny
ideals
of
velocity
are
vanished
that
the
shallow
dip
of
the
keys
in
chopin
day
had
much
to
do
with
the
swiftness
and
lightness
of
his
playing
the
noble
more
sonorous
tone
of
a
modern
piano
requires
greater
breadth
of
style
and
less
speedy
passage
work
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
a
broader
treatment
of
this
charming
display
piece
how
it
makes
the
piano
sound
what
a
rich
brilliant
sweep
it
secures
it

the

to
its

euphonious

glitters
and
crests
itself
only
to
fall
away
as
if
the
sea
were
melodic
and
could
shatter
and
tumble
into
tuneful
foam
the
emotional
content
is
not
marked
the
piece
is
for
the
fashionable
salon
or
the
concert
hall
one
catches
at
its
close
the
overtones
of
bustling
plaudits
and
the
clapping
of
gloved
palms
ductility
an
aristocratic
ease
a
delicate
touch
and
fluent
technique
will
carry
off
this
study
with
good
effect
technically
it
is
useful
one
must
speak
of
the
usefulness
of
chopin
even
in
these
imprisoned
iridescent
soap
bubbles
of
his
on
the
fourth
line
and
in
the
first
bar
of
the
kullak
version
there
is
a
chord
of
the
dominant
seventh
in
dispersed
position
that
does
not
occur
in
any
other
edition
yet
it
must
be
chopin
or
one
of
his
disciples
for
this
autograph
is
in
the
royal
library
at

kullak
thinks
it
ought
to
be
omitted
moreover

slights

occurs
in
all
the
other
editions
situated
in
the
fourth
group
of
the
twentieth
bar
from
the
end
the
f
minor
study
no
is
the
first
one
of
those
tone
studies
of
chopin
in
which
the
mood
is
more
petulant
than
tempestuous
the
melody
is
morbid
almost
irritating
and
yet
not
without
certain
accents
of
grandeur
there
is
a
persistency
in
repetition
that
foreshadows
the
chopin
of
the
later
sadder
years
the
figure
in
the
left
hand
is
the
first
in
which
a
prominent
part
is
given
to
that
member
not
as
noble
and
sonorous
a
figure
as
the
one
in
the
c
minor
study
it
is
a
distinct
forerunner
of
the
bass
of
the
d
minor
prelude
in
this
f
minor
study
the
stretch
is
the
technical
object
it
is
rather
awkward
for
fingers
the
best
fingering
is
von
bulow
it
is
for
the
first

all
the
other
editions
except

von

believes
that
small
hands
beginning
with
his
system
will
achieve
quicker
results
than
by
the
chopin
fingering
this
is
true
riemann
phrases
the

with
a
multiplicity
of

and

kullak
prefers
the
tellefsen
metronome
rather
than
the
traditional
most
of
the
others
use
to
the
quarter
except
riemann
who
espouses
the
more
rapid
gait
of
klindworth
with
his
strikes
a
fair
medium
the
verdict
of
von
bulow
on
the
following
study
in
a
flat
no
has
no
uncertainty
of
tone
in
its
proclamation
he
who
can
play
this
study
in
a
really
finished
manner
may
congratulate
himself
on
having
climbed
to
the
highest
point
of
the
pianist
parnassus
as
it
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
piece
of
the
entire
set
the
whole
repertory
of
piano
music
does
not
contain
a
study
of
perpetuum
mobile
so
full
of
genius
and
fancy
as
this
particular
one
is
universally
acknowledged
to
be
except
perhaps
liszt
feux
follets
the
most
important
point
would
appear
to
lie
not
so
much
in
the
interchange
of
the
groups
of
legato
and
staccato
as
in
the
exercise
of
rhythmic
contrasts
the
alternation
of
two
and
three
part
metre
that
is
of
four
and
six
in
the
same
bar
to
overcome
this
fundamental
difficulty
in
the
art
of
musical
reproduction
is
the
most
important
thing
here
and
with
true
zeal
it
may
even
be
accomplished
easily
kullak
writes
harmonic
anticipations
a
rich
rhythmic
life
originating
in
the
changing
articulation
of
the
in
groups
of
three
and
two
each
this
etude
is
an
exceedingly
piquant
composition
possessing
for
the
hearer
a
wondrous
fantastic
charm
if
played
with
the
proper
insight
the
metronomic
marking
is
practically
the
same
in
all
editions
to
the
quarter
notes
the
study
is
one
of
the
most
charming
of
the
composer
there
is
more
depth
in
it
than
in
the

studies
and
its
effectiveness
in
the
virtuoso
sense
is
unquestionable
a
savor
of

over
its
perfumed

but
there
is
grace
spontaneity
and
happiness
chopin
must
have
been
as
happy
as
his
sensitive
nature
would
allow
when
he
conceived
this
vivacious
caprice
in
all
the
editions

there
is
no

left

if

the

to

let
go
the

much
that

false

of

the
psychical

in

for
that

nocturne
for
the
b
major
the
tuberose
nocturne
and
for
the
e
d

and
g
major
nocturnes
it
remains
unabated
but
in
the
list
there
is
no
such
picture
painted

if
ever
there
was
one
as
this

its

delicate

as
if
the
guitar
had
been
dowered
with
a
soul
and
the
richness
and
originality
of
its
harmonic
scheme
gives
us
pause
to
ask
if
chopin
invention
is
not
almost
boundless
the
melody
itself
is
plaintive
a
plaintive
grace
informs
the
entire
piece
the
harmonization
is
far
more
wonderful
but
to
us
the
chord
of
the
tenth
and
more
remote
intervals
seem
no
longer
daring
modern
composition
has
devilled
the
musical
alphabet
into
the
very
caverns
of
the
grotesque
yet
there
are
harmonies
in
the
last
page
of
this
study
that
still
excite
wonder
the
fifteenth
bar
from
the
end
is
one
that
richard
wagner
might
have
made
from
that
bar
to
the
close
every
group
is
a
masterpiece
remember
this
study
is
a
nocturne
and
even
the
accepted
metronomic
markings
in
most
editions
to
the
quarter
are
not
too
slow
they
might
even
be
slower
allegretto
and
not
a
shade
speedier
the
color
scheme
is
celestial
and
the
ending
a
sigh
not
unmixed
with
happiness
chopin
sensitive
poet
had
his
moments
of
peace
of
divine
content
lebensruhe
the
dizzy
appoggiatura
leaps
in
the
last
two
bars
set
the
seal
of
perfection
upon
this
unique
composition
touching
upon
the
execution
one
may
say
that
it
is
not
for
small
hands
nor
yet
for
big
fists
the
former
must
not
believe
that
any
arrangements
or
simplified
versions
will
ever
produce
the
aerial
effect
the
swaying
of
the
tendrils
of
tone
intended
by
chopin
very
large
hands
are
tempted
by
their
reach
to
crush
the
life
out
of
the
study
in
not
arpeggiating
it

i
have
heard
and
the
impression
was

gives
a

from
and
kullak
is
still
more
explicit
he
analyzes
the
melody
and
planning
the
arpeggiating
with
scrupulous
fidelity
he
shows
why
the
arpeggiating
must
be
affected
with
the

rapidity
bordering
upon
simultaneousness
of
harmony
in
the
case
of
many
chords

has
something
to

about
the

von
bulow
does
not
use
the
arpeggio
sign
after
the
first
chord
he
rightly
believes
it
makes
unclear
for
the
student
the
subtleties
of
harmonic
changes
and
fingering
he
also
suggests
quite
like
the
fertile
hans
guido
that
players
who
have
sufficient
patience
and
enthusiasm
for
the
task
would
find
it
worth
their
while
to
practise
the
arpeggi

reverse

with

the

the

seems
perverse

there
is
no

gives
a
slightly
different
effect
while
klindworth
does
the
same
as
kullak
the
heavy
dynamic
accents
employed
by
riemann
are
unmistakable
they
signify
the
vital
importance
of
the
phrase
at
its
initial
entrance
he
does
not
use
it
at
the
repetition
but
throughout
both
dynamic
and
agogic
accents
are
unsparingly
used
and
the
study
seems
to
resound
with
the
sullen
booming
of
a
park
of
artillery
the
section
with
its
anticipations
of
tristan
and
isolde
is
phrased
by
all
the
editors
as
it
is
never

here
the
technical
figure
takes
precedence
over
the
law
of
the
phrase
and
so
most
virtuosi
place
the
accent
on
the
fifth
finger
regardless
of
the
pattern
this
is
as
it
should
be
in

there
is
a
misprint
at

von
bulow
is
the
only
editor
to
my
knowledge
who
makes
an
enharmonic
key

this
section
it
looks

the

but
is
it
chopin
he
also
gives
a
variant
for
public
performance
by
transforming
the
last
run
in
unisono
into
a
veritable
hurricane
by
interlocked
octaves
the
effect
is
brazen
chopin
needs
no
such
clangorous
padding
in
this
etude
which
gains
by
legitimate
strokes
the
most
startling
contrasts
the
study
is
full
of
tremendous
pathos
it
compasses
the
sublime
and
in
its
most
torrential
moments
the
composer
never
quite
loses
his
mental
equipoise
he
too
can
evoke
tragic
spirits

at
will

with
robert
schumann
beautiful
description
of
this
study
as
quoted
by
kullak
in
treating
of
the
present
book
of
etudes
robert
schumann
after
comparing
chopin
to
a
strange
star
seen
at
midnight
wrote
as
follows
whither
his
path
lies
and
leads
or
how
long
how
brilliant
its
course
is
yet
to
be
who
can
say
as
often
however
as
it
shows
itself
there
is
ever
seen
the
same
deep
dark
glow
the
same
starry
light
and
the
same
austerity
so
that
even
a
child
could
not
fail
to
recognize
it
but
besides
this
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
most
of
these
etudes
played
by
chopin
himself
and
quite
a
la
chopin
did
he
play
them
of
the
first
one
especially
he
writes
imagine
that
an
aeolian
harp
possessed
all
the
musical
scales
and
that
the
hand
of
an
artist
were
to
cause
them
all
to
intermingle
in
all
sorts
of
fantastic
embellishments
yet
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
everywhere
audible
a
deep
fundamental
tone
and
a
soft
upper
voice
and
you
will
get
the
right
idea
of
his
playing
but
it
would
be
an
error
to
think
that
chopin
permitted
every
one
of
the
small
notes
to
be
distinctly
heard
it
was
rather
an
undulation
of
the
a
flat
major
chord
here
and
there
thrown
aloft
anew
by
the
pedal
throughout
all
the
harmonies
one
always
heard
in
great
tones
a
wondrous
melody
while
once
only
in
the
middle
of
the
piece
besides
that
chief
song
a
tenor
voice
became
prominent
in
the
midst
of
chords
after
the
etude
a
feeling
came
over
one
as
of
having
seen
in
a
dream
a
beatific
picture
which
when
half
awake
one
would
gladly
recall
after
these
words
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
mode
of
delivery
no
commentary
is
required
to
show
that
the
melodic
and
other
important
tones
indicated
by
means
of
large
notes
must
emerge
from
within
the
sweetly
whispering
waves
and
that
the
upper
tones
must
be
combined
so
as
to
form
a
real
melody
with
the
finest
and
most
thoughtful
shadings
the
bar
of
this
study
in
a
major
is
so
lisztian
that
liszt
must
have
benefited
by
its
harmonies
and
then
he
played
the
second
in
the
book
in
f
minor
one
in
which
his
individuality
displays
itself
in
a
manner
never
to
be
forgotten
how
charming
how
dreamy
it
was
soft
as
the
song
of
a
sleeping
child
schumann
wrote
this
about
the
wonderful
study
in
f
minor
which
whispers
not
of
baleful
deeds
in
a
dream
as
does
the
last
movement
of
the
b
flat
minor
sonata
but
is
the
song
of
a
sleeping
child
no
comparison
could
be
prettier
for
there
is
a
sweet
delicate
drone
that
sometimes
issues
from
childish
lips
having
a
charm
for
ears
not
attuned
to
grosser
things
this
must
have
been
the
study
that
chopin
played
for
henrietta
voigt
at
leipsic
september
in
her
diary
she
wrote
the
over
excitement
of
his
fantastic
manner
is
imparted
to
the
keen

made
me
hold
my
breath
wonderful
is
the
ease
with
which
his
velvet
fingers
glide
i
might
almost
say
fly
over
the
keys
he
has
enraptured
me
in
a
way
which
hitherto
had
been
unknown
to
me
what
delighted
me
was
the
childlike
natural
manner
which
he
showed
in
his
demeanor
and
in
his
playing
von
bulow
believes
the
interpretation
of
this
magical
music
should
be
without
sentimentality
almost
without
shading
clearly
delicately
and
dreamily
executed
an
ideal
pianissimo
an
accentless
quality
and
completely
without
passion
or
rubato
there
is
little
doubt
this
was
the
way
chopin
played
it
liszt
is
an
authority
on
the
subject
and
mathias
corroborates
him
regarding
the
rhythmical
problem
to
be
overcome
the
combination
of
two
opposing
rhythms
von
bulow
indicates
an
excellent
method
and
kullak
devotes
part
of
a
page
to
examples
of
how
the
right
then
the
left
and
finally
both
hands
are
to
be
treated
kullak
furthermore
writes
or
if
one
will
he
may
also
betake
himself
in
fancy
to
a
still
green
dusky
forest
and
listen
in
profound
solitude
to
the
mysterious
rustling
and
whispering
of
the
foliage
what
indeed
despite
the
algebraic
character
of
the
may
not
a
lively
fancy
conjure
out
of
or
rather
into
this
etude
but
one
thing
is
to
be
held
fast
it
is
to
be
played
in
that
whisper
of
which
among
others
mendelssohn
also
affirmed
that
for
him
nothing
more
enchanting
existed
but
enough
of
subjective
fancies
this
study
contains
much
beauty
and
every
bar
rules
over
a
little
harmonic
kingdom
of
its
own
it
is
so
lovely
that
not
even
the
distortion
in
double
notes
or
the
version
in
octaves
can
dull
its
magnetic
crooning
at
times
so
delicate
is
its
design
that
it
recalls

faint
fantastic
tracery

seems
more
valuable
to
me
not
that
i
mean
to
imply
any
deterioration
for
these
recently
published
studies
were
nearly
all
written
at
the
same
time
as
the
earlier
ones
and
only
a
few
were
composed
a
little
while
ago
the
first
in
a
flat
and
the
last
magnificent
one
in
c
minor
both
of
which
display
great
mastership
one
may
be
permitted
to
disagree
with
schumann
for
op
contains
at
least
two
of
chopin
greater
studies
a
minor
and
c
minor
the
most
valuable
point
of
the
passage
quoted
is
the
clenching
of
the
fact
that
the
studies
were
composed
in
a
bunch
that
settles
many
important
psychological
details
chopin
had
suffered
much
before
going
to
paris
had
undergone
the
purification
and
renunciation
of
an
unsuccessful
love
affair
and
arrived
in
paris
with
his
style
fully
formed
in
his
case
the
style
was
most
emphatically
the
man
kullak
calls
the
study
in
f
a
spirited
little
caprice
whose
kernel
lies
in
the
simultaneous
application
of
four
different
little
rhythms
to
form
a
single
figure
in
sound
which
figure
is
then
repeated
continuously
to
the
end
in
these
repetitions
however
changes
of
accentuation
fresh
modulations
and
piquant
antitheses
serve
to
make
the
composition
extremely
vivacious
and
effective
he
pulls
apart
the
brightly
colored
petals
of
the
thematic
flower
and
reveals
the
inner
chemistry
of
this
delicate
growth
four
different
voices
are
distinguished
in
the
kernel
the
third
voice
is
the
chief
one
and
after
it
the
first
because
they
determine
the
melodic
and
harmonic
contents

the
melody
of

is
in

gives
meaning
to
the

and
what
charm

there
is
in

caprice
it
has
the
tantalizing
elusive

of

almost
eliminated

are

even
where
the

is

the

the

this
minimizes
the
risk
of
the

and
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
do
this
in

at
least
the

be
breathed
away
according
to
kullak
is
variously
fingered
he
also
prescribes
a
most
trying
fingering
for
the
first
group
fourth
finger
on
both
hands
this
is
useful
for
study
but
for
performance
the
third
finger
is
surer
von
bulow
advises
the
player
to
keep
the
upper
part
of
the
body
as
still
as
possible
as
any
haste
of
movement
would
destroy
the
object
in
view
which
is
the
acquisition
of
a
loose
wrist
he
also
suggests
certain
phrasing
in
bar
seventeen
and
forbids
a
sharp
cutting
manner
in
playing
the
sforzati
at
the
last
return
of
the
subject
kullak
is
copious
in
his
directions
and
thinks
the
touch
should
be
light
and
the
hand
gliding
and
in
the
b
major
part
fiery
wilful
accentuation
of
the
inferior
beats
capricious
fantastic
and
graceful
this
study
is
chopin
in
rare
spirits
schumann
has
the
phrase
the
study
should
be
executed
with
amiable
bravura
there
is
a
misprint
in
the
kullak
edition
at
the
beginning
of
the
notes
an
a
instead
of
an
f
upsets
the
tonality
besides
being
absurd
of
the
fourth
study
in
a
minor
there
is
little
to
add
to
theodor
kullak
who
writes
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
word
every
piece
of
music
is
an
etude
in
a
narrower
sense
however
we
demand
of
an
etude
that
it
shall
have
a
special
end
in
view
promote
facility
in
something
and
lead
to
the
conquest
of
some
particular
difficulty
whether
of
technics
of
rhythm
expression
or
delivery
robert
schumann
collected
writings
the
present
study
is
less
interesting
from
a
technical
than
a
rhythmical
point
of
view
while
the
chief
beats
of
the
measure
and
eighths
are
represented
only
by
single
tones
in
the
bass
part
which
are
to
a
certain
extent
free
and
unconcerned
and
void
of
all
encumbrance
the
inferior
parts
of
the
measure
and
eighths
are
burdened
with
chords
the
most
of
which
moreover
are
provided
with
accents
in
opposition
to
the
regular
beats
of
the
measure
further
there
is
associated
with
these
chords
or
there
may
be
said
to
grow
out
of
them
a
cantilene
in
the
upper
voice
which
appears
in
syncopated
form
opposite
to
the
strong
beats
of
the
bass
this
cantilene
begins
on
a
weak
beat
and
produces
numerous
suspensions
which
in
view
of
the
time
of
their
entrance
appear
as
so
many
retardations
and
delayals
of
melodic
tones
all
these
things
combine
to
give
the
composition
a
wholly
peculiar
coloring
to
render
its
flow
somewhat
restless
and
to
stamp
the
etude
as
a
little
characteristic
piece
a
capriccio
which
might
well
be
named
inquietude
as
regards
technics
two
things
are
to
be
studied
the
staccato
of
the
chords
and
the
execution
of
the
cantilena
the
chords
must
be
formed
more
by
pressure
than
by
striking
the
fingers
must
support
themselves
very
lightly
upon
the
chord
keys
and
then
rise
again
with
the
back
of
the
hand
in
the
most
elastic
manner
the
upward
movement
of
the
hand
must
be
very
slight
everything
must
be
done
with
the
greatest
precision
and
not
merely
in
a
superficial
manner
where
the
cantilena
appears
every
melodic
tone
must
stand
apart
from
the
tones
of
the
accompaniment
as
if
in
relief
hence
the
fingers
for
the
melodic
tones
must
press
down
the
keys
allotted
to
them
with
special
force
in
doing
which
the
back
of
the
hand
may
be
permitted
to
turn
lightly
to
the
right
sideward
stroke
especially
when
there
is
a
rest
in
the
accompaniment
compare
with
this
etude
the
introduction
to
the
capriccio
in
b
minor
with
orchestra
by
felix
mendelssohn
first
page
aside
from
a
few
rallentando
places
the
etude
is
to
be
played
strictly
in
time
i
prefer
the
klindworth
editing
of
this
rather
sombre
nervous
composition
which
may
be
merely
an
etude
but
it
also
indicates
a
slightly
pathologic
condition
with
its
syncopations
and
narrow
emotional
range
the
a
minor
study
has
nevertheless
moments
of
power
and
interest
riemann
phrasing
while
careful
is
not
more
enlightening
than
klindworth
von
bulow
says
the
bass
must
be
strongly
marked
throughout
even
when

and
brought
out
in
imitation
of
the
upper
part
singularly
enough
his

the
only
edition
in

arpeggios
at
the
close

the
final

both
hands
may
do

this
is
editorial
quibbling
stephen
heller
remarked
that
this
study
reminded
him
of
the
first
bar
of
the
kyrie
rather
the
requiem
aeternam
of
mozart
requiem
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
fifth
study
in
e
minor
is
less
often
heard
in
the
concert
room
than
any
one
of
its
companions
i
can
not
recall
having
heard
it
since
annette
essipowa
gave
that
famous
recital
during
which
she
played
the
entire
studies
yet
it
is
a
sonorous
piano
piece
rich
in
embroideries
and
general
decorative
effect
in
the
middle
section
perhaps
the
rather
perverse
capricious
and
not
altogether
amiable
character
of
the
beginning
has
caused
pianists
to
be
wary
of
introducing
it
at
a
recital
it
is
hugely
effective
and
also
difficult
especially
if
played
with
the
same
fingering
throughout

suggests

for

i
seek
in
this
collection
of

this
is
the
only
name
appropriate
to
the
works
of
chopin
some
favorite
pieces
which
i
might
fix
in
my
memory
rather
than
others
who
could
retain
everything
for
this
reason
i
have
in
my
notebook
quite
particularly
marked
the
numbers
four
five
and
seven
of
the
present
poems
of
these
twelve
much
loved
studies
every
one
of
which
has
a
charm
of
its
own
the
three
numbers
are
those
i
prefer
to
all
the
rest
the
middle
part
of
this
e
minor
study
recalls
thalberg
von
bulow
cautions
the
student
against
the
accenting
of
the
first
note
with
the
thumb
right
hand
as
it
does
not
form
part
of
the
melody
but
only
comes
in
as
an
unimportant
passing
note
this
refers
to
the
melody
in
he
also
writes
that
the
addition
of
the
third
in
the
left
hand
klindworth
edition
needs
no
special
justification
i
discovered
one
marked
difference
in
the

von

musical
score
excerpt
kullak
writes
that
the
figure
is
not
found
on
the
older
metronomes
this
is
not
too
fast
for
the
capriccio
with
its
pretty
and
ingenious
rhythmical
transformations
as
regards
the
execution
of
the
bar
von
bulow
says
the
acciaccature
prefixes
are
to
be
struck
simultaneously
with
the
other
parts
as
also
the
shake
in
bar
and
following
bars
this
must
begin
with
the
upper
auxiliary
note
these
details
are
important
kullak
concludes
his
notes
thus
despite
all
the
little
transformations
of
the
motive
member
which
forms
the
kernel
its
recognizability
remains
essentially
unimpaired
meanwhile
out
of
these
little
metamorphoses
there
is
developed
a
rich
rhythmic
life
which
the
performer
must
bring
out
with
great
precision
if
in
addition
he
possesses
a
fine
feeling
for
what
is
graceful
coquettish
or
agreeably
capricious
he
will
understand
how
to
heighten
still
further
the
charm
of
the
chief
part
which
as
far
as
its
character
is
concerned
reminds
one
of
etude
op
no
the
secondary
part
in
major
begins
its
kernel
is
formed
of
a
beautiful
broad
melody
which
if
soulfully
conceived
and
delivered
will
sing
its
way
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
listener
for
the
accompaniment
in
the
right
hand
we
find
chord
arpeggiations
in
triplets
afterward
in
sixteenths
calmly
ascending
and
descending
and
surrounding
the
melody
as
with
a
veil
they
are
to
be
played
almost
without
accentuation
it
was
louis
ehlert
who
wrote
of
the
celebrated
study
in
g
sharp
minor
op
no
chopin
not
only
versifies
an
exercise
in
thirds
he
transforms
it
into
such
a
work
of
art
that
in
studying
it
one
could
sooner
fancy
himself
on
parnassus
than
at
a
lesson
he
deprives
every
passage
of
all
mechanical
appearance
by
promoting
it
to
become
the
embodiment
of
a
beautiful
thought
which
in
turn
finds
graceful
expression
in
its
motion
and
indeed
in
the
piano
literature
no
more
remarkable
merging
of
matter
and
manner
exists
the
means
justifies
the
end
and
the
means
employed
by
the
composer
are
beautiful
there
is
no
other
word
to
describe
the
style
and
architectonics
of
this
noble
study
it
is
seldom
played
in
public
because
of
its
difficulty
with
the
schumann
toccata
the
g
sharp
minor
study
stands
at
the
portals
of
the
delectable
land
of
double
notes
both
compositions
have
a
common
ancestry
in
the
czerny
toccata
and
both
are
the
parents
of
such
a
sensational
offspring
as
balakirew
islamey
in
reading
through
the

studies
for
the
instrument
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
to
come
upon
transfiguration
of
such
a
barren
subject
this
study
is
first
music
then
a
technical
problem
where
two
or
three
pianists
are
gathered
together
in
the
name
of
chopin
the
conversation
is
bound
to
formulate
itself
thus
how
do
you

von
bulow
makes
this
statement
as
the
peculiar
fingering
adopted
by
chopin
for
chromatic
scales
in
thirds
appears
to
us
to
render
their
performance
in
legatissimo
utterly
unattainable
on
our
modern
instruments
we
have
exchanged
it
where
necessary
for
the
older
method
of
hummel
two
of
the
greatest
executive
artists
of
modern
times
alexander
dreyschock
and
carl
tausig
were
theoretically
and
practically
of
the
same
opinion
it
is
to
be
conjectured
that
chopin
was
influenced
in
his
method
of
fingering
by
the
piano
of
his
favorite
makers
pleyel
and
wolff
of
paris
who
before
they
adopted
the
double
echappement
certainly
produced
instruments
with
the
most
pliant
touch
possible
and
therefore
regarded
the
use
of
the
thumb
in
the
ascending
scale
on
two
white
keys
in
succession
the
semitones
ef
and
bc
as
practicable
on
the
grand
piano
of
the
present
day
we
regard
it
as
irreconcilable
with
conditions
of
crescendo
legato
this
chopin
fingering
in
reality
derives
directly
from
hummel
see
his
piano
school
so
he
gives
this
fingering
musical
score
excerpt
he
also
suggests
the
following
phrasing
for
the
left
hand
this
is
excellent
musical
score

riemann
not
only
adopts
new
fingering
for
the
double

scale
but
also
begins
the

with
the
trill
on
first
and
third
second
and
fourth
instead
of
the
usual
first
and
fourth
second

fifth
fingers
adopted
by

this
is
his
notion
of
the
run
in
chromatic
thirds
musical

excerpt
for
the
rest
the
study
must
be
played
like
the
wind
or
as
kullak
says
apart
from
a
few
places
and
some
accents
the
etude
is
to
be
played
almost
throughout
in
that
chopin
whisper
the
right
hand
must
play
its
thirds
especially
the
diatonic
and
chromatic
scales
with
such
equality
that
no
angularity
of
motion
shall
be
noticeable
where
the

von
bulow
calls
the
seventh
study
the
one
in
c
sharp
minor
a
nocturne
a
duo
for
and
flute
he
ingeniously
smooths
out
the
unequal
rhythmic
differences
of
the
two
hands
and
justly
says
the
piece
does
not
work
out
any
special
technical
matter
this
study
is
the
most
lauded
of
all
yet
i
can
not
help
agreeing
with
niecks
who
writes
of
it
he
oddly
enough
places
it
in
the
key
of
e
a
duet
between
a
he
and
a
she
of
whom
the
former
shows
himself
more
talkative
and
emphatic
than
the
latter
is
indeed
very
sweet
but
perhaps
also
somewhat
tiresomely
monotonous
as
such
naturally
are
to
third
parties
for
chopin
contemporaries
this
was
one
of
his
greatest
efforts
heller
wrote
it
engenders
the
sweetest
sadness
the
most
enviable
torments
and
if
in
playing
it
one
feels
oneself
insensibly
drawn
toward
mournful
and
melancholy
ideas
it
is
a
disposition
of
the
soul
which
i
prefer
to
all
others
alas
how
i
love
these
sombre
and
mysterious
dreams
and
chopin
is
the
god
who
creates
them
in
this
etude
kleczynski
thinks
there
are
traces
of
weariness
of
life
and
quotes
orlowski
chopin
friend
he
is
only
afflicted
with
homesickness
willeby
calls
this
study
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
for
me
it
is
both
morbid
and
elegiac
there
is
nostalgia
in
it
the
nostalgia
of
a
sick
lacerated
soul
it
contains
in
solution
all
the
most
objectionable
and
most
endearing
qualities
of
the
master
perhaps
we
have
heard
its
sweet
highly
perfumed
measures
too
often
its
interpretation
is
a
matter
of
taste
kullak
has
written
the
most
ambitious
programme
for
it
here
is
a
quotation
from
albert
translation
in
schirmer
edition
of
kullak
throughout
the
entire
piece
an
elegiac
mood
prevails
the
composer
paints
with
psychologic
truthfulness
a
fragment
out
of
the
life
of
a
deeply
clouded
soul
he
lets
a
broken
heart
filled
with
grief
proclaim
its
sorrow
in
a
language
of
pain
which
is
incapable
of
being
misunderstood
the
heart
has
lost
not
something
but
everything
the
tones
however
do
not
always
bear
the
impress
of
a
quiet
melancholy
resignation
more
passionate
impulses
awaken
and
the
still
plaint
becomes
a
complaint
against
cruel
fate
it
seeks
the
conflict
and
tries
through
force
of
will
to
burst
the
fetters
of
pain
or
at
least
to
alleviate
it
through
absorption
in
a
happy
past
but
in
vain
the
heart
has
not
lost
something
it
has
lost
everything
the
musical
poem
divides
into
three
or
if
one
views
the
little
episode
in
b
major
as
a
special
part
into
four
parts
strophes
of
which
the
last
is
an
elaborated
repetition
of
the
first
with
a
brief
closing
part
appended
the
whole
piece
is
a
song
or
better
still
an
aria
in
which
two
principal
voices
are
to
be
brought
out
the
upper
one
is
in
imitation
of
a
human
voice
while
the
lower
one
must
bear
the
character
throughout
of
an
obligato
violoncello
it
is
well
known
that
chopin
was
very
fond
of
the
violoncello
and
that
in
his
piano
compositions
he
imitated
the
style
of
passages
peculiar
to
that
instrument
the
two
voices
correspond
closely
supplementing
and
imitating
each
other
reciprocally
between
the
two
a
third
element
exists
an
accompaniment
of
eighths
in
uniform
succession
without
any
significance
beyond
that
of
filling
out
the
harmony
this
third
element
is
to
be
kept
wholly
subordinate
the
little
introduction
in
recitative
style
which
precedes
the
aria
reminds
one
vividly
of
the
beginning
of
the
ballade
in
g
minor
op
the
d
flat
study
no
is
called
by
von
bulow
the
most
useful
exercise
in
the
whole
range
of
etude
literature
it
might
truly
be
called
du
pianiste
if
the
term
through
misuse
had
not
fallen
into
disrepute
as
a
remedy
for
stiff
fingers

even
to
the
most
expert

the

hand
is
recommended
kullak
finds
this
study
surprisingly
euphonious
but
devoid
of
depth
of
content
it
is
an
admirable
study
for
the
cultivation
of
double
sixths
it
contains
a
remarkable
passage
of
consecutive
fifths
that
set
the
theorists
by
the
ears
riemann
manages
to
get
some
new
editorial
comment
upon
it
the
nimble
study

which
bears
the
title
of
the
butterfly
is
in

flat
von
bulow
transposes
it
enharmonically
to
f
sharp
avoiding
numerous
double
flats
the
change
is
not
laudable
he
holds
anything
but
an
elevated
opinion
of
the
piece
classing
it
with
a
composition
of
the
charles
mayer
order
this
is
unjust
the
study
if
not
deep
is
graceful
and
certainly
very
effective
it
has
lately
become
the
stamping
ground
for
the
display
of
piano
athletics
nearly
all
modern
virtuosi
pull
to
pieces
the
wings
of
this
gay
little
butterfly
they
smash
it
they
bang
it
and
adding
insult
to
cruelty
they
finish
it
with
three
chords
mounting
an
octave
each
time
thus
giving
a
conventional
character
to
the
close
the
very
thing
the

avoids
much
distorted

niecks
says
it
is

for
a
while
holier
sounds

but
finally
hell

the

is
for
kullak
somewhat
far
fetched
and
forced
in
invention
and
leaves
one
cold
although
it
plunges
on
wildly
to
the
end
von

has
made
the
most
complete
edition
klindworth
strengthens

and
the
seventh
eighth
notes
of
the
fifth
bar
before
the
last
by
filling
in
the
harmonics
of
the
left
hand
this
etude
is
an
important
one
technically
because
many
pianists
make
little
of
it
that
does
not
abate
its
musical
significance
and
i
am
almost
inclined
to
group
it
with
the
last
two
studies
of
this
opus
the
opening
is
portentous
and
soon
becomes
a
driving
whirlwind
of
tone
chopin
has
never
penned
a
lovelier
melody
than
the
one
in
b
the
middle
section
of
this
etude
it
is
only
to
be
compared
to
the
one
in
the
same
key
in
the
b
minor
scherzo
while
the
return
to
the
first
subject
is
managed
as
consummately
as
in
the
e
flat
minor
scherzo
from
op
i
confess
to
being
stirred
by
this
b
minor
study
with
its
tempo
at
a
forced
draught
and
with
its
precipitous
close
there
is
a
lushness
about
the
octave
melody
the
tune
may
be
a
little
overripe
but
it
is
sweet
sensuous
music
and
about
it
hovers
the
hush
of
a
rich
evening
in
early
autumn
and
now
the
winter
wind
the
study
in
a
minor
op
no
here
even
von
bulow
becomes
enthusiastic
it
must
be
mentioned
as
a
particular
merit
of
this
the
longest
and
in
every
respect
the
grandest
of
chopin
studies
that
while
producing
the
greatest
fulness
of
sound
imaginable
it
keeps
itself
so
entirely
and
utterly
unorchestral
and
represents
piano
music
in
the
most
accurate
sense
of
the
word
to
chopin
is
due
the
honor
and
credit
of
having
set
fast
the
boundary
between
piano
and
orchestral
music
which
through
other
composers
of
the
romantic
school
especially
robert
schumann
has
been
defaced
and
blotted
out
to
the
prejudice
and
damage
of
both
species
kullak
is
equally
as
warm
in
his
praise
of
it
one
of
the
grandest
and
most
ingenious
of
chopin
etudes
and
a
companion
piece
to
op
no
which
perhaps
it
even
surpasses
it
is
a
bravura
study
of
the
highest
order
and
is
captivating
through
the
boldness
and
originality
of
its
passages
whose
rising
and
falling
waves
full
of
agitation
overflow
the
entire
keyboard
captivating
through
its
harmonic
and
modulatory
shadings
and
captivating
finally
through
a
wonderfully
invented
little
theme
which
is
drawn
like
a
red
thread
through
all
the
flashing
and
glittering
waves
of
tone
and
which
as
it
were
prevents
them
from
scattering
to
all
quarters
of
the
heavens
this
little
theme
strictly
speaking
only
a
phrase
of
two
measures
is
in
a
certain
sense
the
motto
which
serves
as
a
superscription
for
the
etude
appearing
first
one
voiced
and
immediately
afterward
four
voiced
the
slow
time
lento
shows
the
great
importance
which
is
to
be
attached
to
it
they
who
have
followed
thus
far
and
agree
with
what
has
been
said
can
not
be
in
doubt
concerning
the
proper
artistic
delivery
to
execute
the
passages
quite
in
the
rapid
time
prescribed
one
must
possess
a
finished
technique
great
facility
lightness
of
touch
equality
strength
and
endurance
in
the
forte
passages
together
with
the
clearest
distinctness
in
the
piano
and
pianissimo
all
of
this
must
have
been
already
achieved
for
the
interpreter
must
devote
his
whole
attention
to
the
poetic
contents
of
the
composition
especially
to
the
delivery
of
the
rhythms
which
possess
a
life
of
their
own
appearing
now
calm
and
circumspect
and
anon
bold
and
challenging
the
element
naturally
requires
strict
playing

this

is
magnificent

moreover

as
regards
grouping
riemann
follows
von

but
places
his
accents
differently
the
canvas
is
chopin
largest
for
the
idea
and
its
treatment
are
on
a
vastly
grander
scale
than
any
contained
in
the
two
concertos
the
latter
are
after
all
miniatures
precious
ones
if
you
will
joined
and
built
with
cunning
artifice
in
neither
work
is
there
the
resistless
overflow
of
this
etude
which
has
been
compared
to
the
screaming
of
the
winter
blasts
ah
how
chopin
puts
to
flight
those
modern
men
who
scheme
out
a
big
decorative
pattern
and
then
have
nothing
wherewith
to
fill
it
he
never
relaxes
his
theme
and
its
fluctuating
surprises
are
many
the
end
is
notable
for
the
fact
that
scales
appear
chopin
very
seldom
uses
scale
figures
in
his
studies
from
hummel
to
thalberg
and
herz
the
keyboard
had
glittered
with
spangled
scales
chopin
must
have
been
sick
of
them
as
sick
of
them
as
of
the
melody
with
arpeggiated
accompaniment
in
the
right
a
la
thalberg
scales
had
been
used
too
much
hence
chopin
sparing
employment
of
them
in

there
is
a

the

but
there
are
no
other
specimens
of
the
form
until
the
mighty
run
at
the
conclusion
of
this
a
minor
study
it
takes
prodigious
power
and
endurance
to
play
this
work
prodigious

no

poetry
it

no

the
prime
technical
difficulty
is
the
management

thumb
kullak

made
a
variant

performance
it
is

the

kullak

the

magnificent
composition
for

in

for

which
requires
no
comment
i
differ
from
this
worthy
teacher
rather
is
niecks
more
to
my
taste
no
c
minor
in
which
the
emotions
rise
not
less
high
than
the
waves
of
arpeggios
which
symbolize
them
von
bulow
is
didactic
the
requisite
strength
for
this
grandiose
bravura
study
can
only
be
attained
by
the
utmost
clearness
and
thus
only
by
a
gradually
increasing
speed
it
is
therefore
most
desirable
to
practise
it
piano
also
by
way
of
variety
for
otherwise
the
strength
of
tone
might
easily
degenerate
into
hardness
and
in
the
poetic
striving
after
a
realistic
portrayal
of
a
storm
on
the
piano
the
instrument
as
well
as
the
piece
would
come
to
grief
the
pedal
is
needful
to
give
the
requisite
effect
and
must
change
with
every
new
harmony
but
it
should
only
be
used
in
the
latter
stages
of
study
when
the
difficulties
are
nearly
mastered
we
have
our
preferences
mine
in
op
is
the
c
minor
study
which
like
the
prelude
in
d
minor
is
full
of
the
sound
of
great
guns
willeby
thinks
otherwise
on
page
in
his
life
of
chopin
he
has
the
courage
to
write
had
professor
niecks
applied
the
term
monotonous
to
no
we
should
have
been
more
ready
to
indorse
his
opinion
as
although
great
power
is
manifested
the
very
of
the
form
of
the
arpeggio
figure
causes
a
certain
amount
of
monotony
to
be
felt
the
c
minor
study
is
in
a
degree
a
return
to
the
first
study
in
while
the
idea
in
the
former
is
infinitely
nobler
more
dramatic
and
tangible
there
is
in
the
latter
naked
primeval
simplicity
the
larger
eloquence
the
elemental
puissance
monotonous
a
thousand
times
no
monotonous
as
is
the
thunder
and
spray
of
the
sea
when
it
tumbles
and
roars
on
some
sullen
savage
shore
in
its
ruggedness
the
chopin
of
this
c
minor
study
is
as
far
removed
from
the
musical
dandyisms
of
the
parisian
drawing
rooms
as
is
beethoven
himself
it
is
orchestral
in
intention

a
true
epic
of
the

half
notes
at

the
best
of

gives
the
liszt
method
of
working
up
the
climax
in
octave
triplets
how
liszt
must
have
thundered
through
this
tumultuous
work
before
it
all
criticism
should
be
silenced
that
fails
to
allow
chopin
a
place
among
the
greatest
creative

we
are

that
these

however
are
by
no

very
characteristic
may
be
regarded
more
than

as
the
outcome
of
a
gleaning
the
last

has
added
much
to
the
artistic
stature
of
these
three
supplementary

they
have
something
of
the

a
masterpiece
in

the
theme

quarters

unequally
pitted
against

bass
the
technical
difficulty
to
be
overcome
is
purely
rhythmic
and
kullak
takes
pains
to
show
how
it
may
be
overcome
it
is
the
musical
the
emotional
content
of
the
study
that
fascinates
the
worthy
editor
calls
it
a
companion
piece
to
the
f
minor
study
in
op
the
comparison
is
not
an
apt
one
far
deeper
is
this
new
study
and
although
the
doors
never
swing
quite
open
we
divine
the
tragic
issues
concealed
beautiful
in
a
different
way
is
the
a
flat
study
which
follows
again
the
problem
is
a
rhythmical
one
and
again
the
composer
demonstrates
his
exhaustless
invention
and
his
power
of
evoking
a
single
mood
viewing
all
its
lovely
contours
and
letting
it
melt
away
like
dream
magic
full
of
gentle
sprightliness
and
lingering
sweetness
is
this
study
chopin
has
the
hypnotic
quality
more
than
any
composer
of
the
century
richard
wagner
excepted
after
you
have
enjoyed
playing
this
study
read
kullak
and
his
triplicity
in
biplicity
it
may
do
you
good
and
it
will
not
harm
the
music
in
all
the
editions
save
one
that
i
have
seen
the
third
study
in
d
flat
begins
on
a
flat
like
the
famous
valse
in
d
flat
the
exception
is
klindworth
who
starts
with
b
flat
the
note
above
the
study
is
full
of
sunny
good
humor
spiritualized
humor
and
leaves
the
most
cheering
impression
after
its
performance
its
technical
object
is
a
simultaneous
legato
and
staccato
the
result
is
an
idealized
valse
in
allegretto
tempo
the
very
incarnation
of
joy
tempered
by
aristocratic
reserve
chopin
never
romps
but
he
jests
wittily
and
always
in
supremely
good
taste
this
study
fitly
closes
his
extraordinary
labors
in
this
form
and
it
is
as
if
he
had
signed
it
chopin
et
ego
in
arcady
among
the
various
editions
let
me
recommend
klindworth
for
daily
usage
while
frequent
reference
to
von
bulow
riemann
and
kullak
can
not
fail
to
prove
valuable
curious
and
interesting
of
the
making
of
chopin
editions
there
is
seemingly
no
end
in
i
saw
in
manuscript
some
remarkable
versions
of
the
chopin
studies
by
leopold
godowsky
the
study
in
g
sharp
minor
was
the
first
one
published
and
played
in
public
by
this
young
pianist
unlike
the
brahms
derangements
they
are
musical
but
immensely
difficult
as
are
the
figures
a
chopin
even
if
hovers
about
sometimes
with
uplifted
sometimes
with
angry
knitted
forehead
and
not
seldom
amused
to
the
point
of
smiling
you
see
his
narrow
shoulders
shrugged
in
the
polish
fashion
as
he
examines
the
study
in
transposed
to
the
left
hand
curiously
enough
this
transcription
difficult
as
it
is
does
not
tax
the
fingers
as
much
as
a
bedevilment
of
the
a
minor
op
no
which
is
extremely
difficult
demanding
color
discrimination
and
individuality
of
finger
more
and
a
piece
at
which
one
must
cry
out
hats
off
gentlemen
a
tornado
is
the
caprice
called
badinage
but
if
it
is
meant
to
badinage
it
is
no
sport
for
the
pianist
of
everyday
technical
attainments
this
is
formed
of
two
studies
in
the
right
hand
is
the
g
flat
study
op
no
and
in
the
left
the
black
key
study
op
no
the
two
go
laughing
through
the
world
like
old
friends
brother
and
sister
they
are
tonally
trailing
behind
them
a
cloud
of
iridescent
glory
godowsky
has
cleverly
combined
the
two
following
their
melodic
curves
as
nearly
as
is
possible
in
some
places
he
has
thickened
the
harmonies
and
shifted
the
black
key
figures
to
the
right
hand
it
is
the
work
of
a
remarkable
pianist
this
is
the
way
it
looks
on
paper
at
the
beginning
musical
llustration
the
same
study
g
flat
op
no
is
also
treated
separately
the
melody
being
transferred
to
the
treble
the
butterfly
octaves
in
another
study
are
made
to
hop
nimbly
along
in
the
left
hand
and
the
c
major
study
op
no
chopin
toccata
is
arranged
for
the
left
hand
and
seems
very
practical
and
valuable
here
the
adapter
has
displayed
great
taste
and
skill
especially
on
the
third
page
the
pretty
musical
idea
is
not
destroyed
but
viewed
from
other
points
of
vantage
op
no
is
treated
like
a
left
hand
study
as
it
should
be
chopin
did
not
always
give
enough
work
to
the
left
hand
and
the
first
study
of
this
opus
in
c
is
planned
on
brilliant
lines
for
both
hands
ingenious
is
the
manipulation
of
the
seldom
played
op
no
in
e
minor
as
a
study
in
rhythms
and
double
notes
it
is
very
welcome
the
f
minor
study
op
no
as
considered
by
the
ambidextrous
godowsky
is
put
in
the
bass
where
it
whirrs
along
to
the
melodic
encouragement
of
a
theme
of
the
paraphraser
own
in
the
right
this
study
has
suffered
the
most
of
all
for
brahms
in
his
heavy
teutonic
way
set
it
grinding
double
sixths
while
isidor
philipp
in
his
studies
for
the
left
hand
has
harnessed
it
to
sullen
octaves
this
frenchman
by
the
way
has
also
arranged
for
left
hand
alone
the
g
sharp
minor
the
d
flat
double
sixths
the
a
minor
winter
wind
studies
the
b
flat
minor
prelude
and
terrible
to
relate
the
last
movement
of
the
chopin
b
flat
minor
sonata
are
the
godowsky
transcriptions
available
certainly
in
ten
years
so
rapid
is
the
technical
standard
advancing
they
will
be
used
in
the
curriculum
of
students
whether
he
has
treated
chopin
with
reverence
i
leave
my
betters
to
determine
what
has
reverence
to
do
with
the
case
anyhow
plato
is
parsed
in
the
schoolroom
and
beethoven
taught
in
conservatories
therefore
why
worry
over
the
question
of
attitude
besides
he
is
writing
for
the
next
generation
presumably
a
generation
of
rosenthals
and
now
having
passed
over
the
salt
and
stubbly
domain
of
pedagogics
what
is
the
dominant
impression
gleaned
from
the
chopin
studies
is
it
not
one
of
admiration
tinged
with
wonder
at
such
a
prodigal
display
of
thematic
and
technical
invention
their
variety
is
great
the
aesthetic
side
is
nowhere
neglected
for
the
purely
mechanical
and
in
the
most
poetic
of
them
stuff
may
be
found
for
delicate
fingers
astounding
canorous
enchanting
alembicated
and
dramatic
the
chopin
studies
are
exemplary
essays
in
emotion
and
manner
in
them
is
mirrored
all
of
chopin
the
planetary
as
well
as
the
secular
chopin
when
most
of
his
piano
music
has
gone
the
way
of
all
things
fashioned
by
mortal
hands
these
studies
will
endure
will
stand
for
the
nineteenth
century
as
beethoven
crystallized
the
eighteenth
bach
the
seventeenth
centuries
in
piano
music
chopin
is
a
classic
vii
moods
in
miniature
the
preludes
the
preludes
bear
the
opus
number
and
are
dedicated
to
kessler
a
composer
of
piano
studies
it
is
only
the
german
edition
that
bears
his
name
the
french
and
english
being
inscribed
by
chopin
a
son
ami
pleyel
as
pleyel
advanced
the
pianist
francs
for
the
preludes
he
had
a
right
to
say
these
are
my
preludes
niecks
is
authority
for
chopin
remark
i
sold
the
preludes
to
pleyel
because
he
liked
them
this
was
in
when
chopin
health
demanded
a
change
of
climate
he
wished
to
go
to
majorca
with
madame
sand
and
her
children
and
had
applied
for
money
to
the
piano
maker
and
publisher
camille
pleyel
he
received
but
five
hundred
francs
in
advance
the
balance
being
paid
on
delivery
of
the
manuscript
the
preludes
were
published
in
yet
there
is
internal
evidence
which
proves
that
most
of
them
had
been
composed
before
the
trip
to
the
balearic
islands
this
will
upset
the
very
pretty
legend
of
music
making
at
the
monastery
of
valdemosa
have
we
not
all
read
with
sweet
credulity
the
eloquent
pages
in
george
sand
in
which
the
storm
is
described
that
overtook
the
novelist
and
her
son
maurice
after
terrible
trials
dangers
and
delays
they
reached
their
home
and
found
chopin
at
the
piano
uttering
a
cry
he
arose
and
stared
at
the
pair
ah
i
knew
well
that
you
were
dead
it
was
the
sixth
prelude
the
one
in
b
minor
that
he
played
and
dreaming
as
sand
writes
that
he
saw
himself
drowned
in
a
lake
heavy
ice
cold
drops
of
water
fell
at
regular
intervals
upon
his
breast
and
when
i
called
his
attention
to
those
drops
of
water
which
were
actually
falling
upon
the
roof
he
denied
having
heard
them
he
was
even
vexed
at
what
i
translated
by
the
term
imitative
harmony
he
protested
with
all
his
might
and
he
was
right
against
the
puerility
of
these
imitations
for
the
ear
his
genius
was
full
of
mysterious
harmonies
of
nature
yet
this
prelude
was
composed
previous
to
the
majorcan
episode
the
preludes
says
niecks
consist
to
a
great
extent
at
least
of
pickings
from
the
composer
portfolios
of
pieces
sketches
and
memoranda
written
at
various
times
and
kept
to
be
utilized
when
occasion
might
offer
gutmann
chopin
pupil
who
nursed
him
to
the
last
declared
the
preludes
to
have
been
composed
before
he
went
away
with
madame
sand
and
to
niecks
personally
he
maintained
that
he
had
copied
all
of
them
niecks
does
not
credit
him
altogether
for
there
are
letters
in
which
several
of
the
preludes
are
mentioned
as
being
sent
to
paris
so
he
reaches
the
conclusion
that
chopin
labors
at
majorca
on
the
preludes
were
confined
to
selecting
filing
and
polishing
this
seems
to
be
a
sensible
solution
robert
schumann
wrote
of
these
preludes
i
must
signalize
them
as
most
remarkable
i
will
confess
i
expected
something
quite
different
carried
out
in
the
grand
style
of
his
studies
it
is
almost
the
contrary
here
these
are
sketches
the
beginning
of
studies
or
if
you
will
ruins
eagles
feathers
all
strangely
intermingled
but
in
every
piece
we
find
in
his
own
hand
chopin
wrote
it
one
recognizes
him
in
his
pauses
in
his
impetuous
respiration
he
is
the
boldest
the
proudest
poet
soul
of
his
time
to
be
sure
the
book
also
contains
some
morbid
feverish
repellant
traits
but
let
everyone
look
in
it
for
something
that
will
enchant
him
philistines
however
must
keep
away
it
was
in
these
preludes
that
ignaz
moscheles
first
comprehended
chopin
and
his
methods
of
execution
the
german
pianist
had
found
his
music
harsh
and
dilettantish
in
modulation
but
chopin
originality
of
performance
he
glides
lightly
over
the
keys
in
a
way
with
his
delicate
fingers
quite
reconciled
the
elder
man
to
this
strange
music
to
liszt
the
preludes
seem
modestly
named
but
are
not
the
less
types
of
perfection
in
a
mode
created
by
himself
and
stamped
like
all
his
other
works
with
the
high
impress
of
his
poetic
genius
written
in
the
commencement
of
his
career
they
are
characterized
by
a
youthful
vigor
not
to
be
found
in
some
of
his
subsequent
works
even
when
more
elaborate
finished
and
richer
in
combinations
a
vigor
which
is
entirely
lost
in
his
latest
productions
marked
by
an
overexcited
sensibility
a
morbid
irritability
and
giving
painful
intimations
of
his
own
state
of
suffering
and
exhaustion
liszt
as
usual
erred
on
the
sentimental
side
chopin
being
essentially
a
man
of
moods
like
many
great
men
and
not
necessarily
feminine
in
this
respect
can
not
always
be
pinned
down
to
any
particular
period
several
of
the
preludes
are
very
morbid
i
purposely
use
this
word
as
is
some
of
his
early
music
while
he
seems
quite
gay
just
before
his
death
the
preludes
follow
out
no
technical
idea
are
free
creations
on
a
small
basis
and
exhibit
the
musician
in
all
his
versatility
says
louis
ehlert
no
work
of
chopin
portrays
his
inner
organization
so
faithfully
and
completely
much
is
embryonic
it
is
as
though
he
turned
the
leaves
of
his
fancy
without
completely
reading
any
page
still
one
finds
in
them
the
thundering
power
of
the
scherzi
the
half
satirical
half
coquettish
elegance
of
the
mazurkas
and
the
southern
luxuriously
fragrant
breath
of
the
nocturnes
often
it
is
as
though
they
were
small
falling
stars
dissolved
into
tones
as
they
fall
jean
kleczynski
who
is
credited
with
understanding
chopin
himself
a
pole
and
a
pianist
thinks
that
people
have
gone
too
far
in
seeking
in
the
preludes
for
traces
of
that
misanthropy
of
that
weariness
of
life
to
which
he
was
prey
during
his
stay
in
the
island
of
majorca
very
few
of
the
preludes
present
this
character
of
ennui
and
that
which
is
the
most
marked
the
second
one
must
have
been
written
according
to
count
tarnowski
a
long
time
before
he
went
to
majorca
what
is
there
to
say
concerning
the
other
preludes
full
of
good
humor
and
gaiety
no
in
e
flat
no
in
b
flat
no
in
f
or
the
last
in
d
minor
is
it
not
strong
and
energetic
concluding
as
it
does
with
three
cannon
shots
willeby
in
his
frederic
francois
chopin
considers
at
length
the
preludes
he
agrees
in
the
main
with
niecks
that
certain
of
these
compositions
were
written
at
valdemosa
nos
and
and
that
chopin
having
sketches
of
others
with
him
completed
the
whole
there
and
published
them
under
one
opus
number
the
atmosphere
of
those
i
have
named
is
morbid
and
azotic
to
them
there
clings
a
faint
flavor
of
disease
a
something
which
is
overripe
in
its
lusciousness
and
febrile
in
its
passion
this
in
itself
inclines
me
to
believe
they
were
written
at
the
time
named
this
is
all
very
well
but
chopin
was
faint
and
febrile
in
his
music
before
he
went
to
majorca
and
the
plain
facts
adduced
by
gutmann
and
niecks
can
not
be
passed
over
henry
james
an
old
admirer
of
madame
sand
admits
her
utter
unreliability
and
so
we
may
look
upon
her
evidence
as
romantic
but
by
no
means
infallible
the
case
now
stands
chopin
may
have
written
a
few
of
the
preludes
at
majorca
filed
them
finished
them
but
the
majority
of
them
were
in
his
portfolio
in
and
op
a
separate
prelude
in
c
sharp
minor
was
published
in
december
it
was
composed
at
nohant
in
august
of
that
year
it
is
dedicated
to
mme
la
princesse
elizabeth
czernicheff
whose
name
as
chopin
confesses
in
a
letter
he
knows
not
how
to
spell
ii
theodore
kullak
is
curt
and
pedagogic
in
his
preface
to
the
preludes
he
writes
chopin
genius
nowhere
reveals
itself
more
charmingly
than
within
narrowly
bounded
musical
forms
the
preludes
are
in
their
aphoristic
brevity
masterpieces
of
the
first
rank
some
of
them
appear
like
briefly
sketched
mood
pictures
related
to
the
nocturne
style
and
offer
no
technical
hindrance
even
to
the
less
advanced
player
i
mean
nos
and
more
difficult
are
nos
and
without
however
demanding
eminent
virtuosity
the
other
preludes
belong
to
a
species
of
despite
their
brevity
of
outline
they
are
on
a
par
with
the
great
collections
op
and
op
in
so
far
as
it
is
practicable
special
cases
of
individual
endowments
not
being
taken
into
consideration
i
would
propose
the
following
order
of
succession
begin
with
nos
and
very
great
bravura
is
demanded
by
nos
and
the
difficulty
of
the
other
preludes
nos
and
lies
in
the
delicate
piano
and
legato
technique
which
on
account
of
the
extended
positions
leaps
and
double
notes
presupposes
a
high
degree
of
development
this
is
eminently
a
common
sense
grouping
the
first
prelude
which
like
the
first
etude
begins
in
c
has
all
the
characteristics
of
an
impromptu
we
know
the
wonderful
bach
preludes
which
grew
out
of
a
free
improvisation
to
the
collection
of
dance
forms
called
a
suite
and
the
preludes
which
precede
his
fugues
in
the
latter
bach
sometimes
exhibits
all
the
objectivity
of
the
study
or
toccata
and
often
wears
his
heart
in
full
view
chopin
preludes
the
only
preludes
to
be
compared
to
bach
are
largely
personal
subjective
and
intimate
this
first
one
is
not
yet
it
could
have
been
written
by
no
one
but
a
devout
bach
student
the
pulsating
passionate
agitated
feverish
hasty
qualities
of
the
piece
are
modern
so
is
the
changeful
modulation
it
is
a
beautiful
composition
rising
to
no
dramatic
heights
but
questioning
and
full
of
life
klindworth

who
has
edited
a
few
of
the
preludes
phrases
the
first
bars
thus
desperate
and
exasperating
to
the
nerves
is
the
second
prelude
in
a
minor
it
is
an
asymmetric
tune
chopin
seldom
wrote
ugly
music
but
is
this
not
ugly
forlorn
despairing
almost
grotesque
and
discordant
it
indicates
the
deepest
depression
in
its
sluggish
progression
willeby
finds
a
resemblance
to
the
theme
of
the
first
nocturne
and
such
a
theme
the
tonality
is
vague
beginning
in
e
minor
chopin
method
of
thematic
parallelism
is
here
very
clear
a
small
figure
is
repeated
in
descending
keys
until
hopeless
gloom
and
depraved
melancholy
are
reached
in
the
closing
chords
chopin
now
is
morbid
here
are
all
his
most
antipathetic
qualities
there
is
aversion
to
life
in
this
music
he
is
a
true
lycanthrope
a
hypnosis
a
mental
an
emotional
atrophy
are
all
present
kullak
divides
the
accompaniment
difficult
for

hands
between
the
two
riemann
detaches
the
eighth
notes
of
the
bass
figures
as
is
his
wont
for
greater
clearness
like
klindworth
he
accents
heavily
the
final
chords
he
marks
his
metronome
to
the
half
note
all
the
editions
are
lento
with
alla
breve
that
the
preludes
are
a
sheaf
of
moods
loosely
held
together
by
the
rather
vague
title
is
demonstrated
by
the
third
in
the
key
of
the
rippling
figure
for
the
left
hand
is
in
the
nature
of
a
study
the
melody
is
delicate
in
sentiment
gallic
in
its
esprit
a
true
salon
piece
this
prelude
has
no
hint
of
artificiality
it
is
a
precise
antithesis
to
the
mood
of
the
previous
one
graceful
and
gay
the
g
major
prelude
is
a
fair
reflex
of
chopin
sensitive
and
naturally
buoyant
nature
it
requires
a
light
hand
and
nimble
fingers
the
melodic
idea
requires
no
special
comment
kullak
phrases
it
differently
from
riemann
and
klindworth
the
latter
is
the
preferable
klindworth
gives
to
the
half
note
as
his
metronomic
marking
riemann
only
which
is
too
slow
while
klindworth
contents
himself
by
marking
a
simple
vivace
regarding
the
fingering
one
may
say
that
all
tastes
are
pleased
in
these
three
editions
klindworth
is
the
easiest
riemann
breaks
up
the
phrase
in
the
bass
figure
but
i
can
not
see
the
gain
on
the
musical
side
niecks
truthfully
calls
the
fourth
prelude
in
e
minor
a
little
poem
the
exquisitely
sweet
languid
pensiveness
of
which
defies
description
the
composer
seems
to
be
absorbed
in
the
narrow
sphere
of
his
ego
from
which
the
wide
noisy
world
is
for
the
time
shut
out
willeby
finds
this
prelude
to
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
these
spontaneous
sketches
for
they
are
no
more
than
sketches
the
melody
seems
literally
to
wail
and
reaches
its
greatest
pitch
of
intensity
at
the
stretto
for
karasowski
it
is
a
real
gem
and
alone
would
immortalize
the
name
of
chopin
as
a
poet
it
must
have
been
this
number
that
impelled
rubinstein
to
assert
that
the
preludes
were
the
pearls
of
his
works
in
the
klindworth
edition
fifth
bar
from
the
last
the
editor
has
filled
in
the
harmonies
to
the
first
six
notes
of
the
left
hand
added
thirds
which
is
not
reprehensible
although
uncalled
for
kullak
makes
some
new
dynamic
markings
and
several
enharmonic
changes
he
also
gives
as
metronome
to
the
quarter
this
tiny
prelude
contains
wonderful
music
the
grave
reiteration
of
the
theme
may
have
suggested
to
peter
cornelius
his
song
ein
ton
chopin
expands
a
melodic
unit
and
one
singularly
pathetic
the
whole
is
like
some
canvas
by
rembrandt
rembrandt
who
first
dramatized
the
shadow
in
which
a
single
motif
is
powerfully
handled
some
sombre
effect
of
echoing
light
in
the
profound
of
a
dutch
interior
for
background
chopin
has
substituted
his
soul
no
one
in
art
except
bach
or
rembrandt
could
paint
as
chopin
did
in
this
composition
its
despair
has
the
antique
flavor
and
there
is
a
breadth
nobility
and
proud
submission
quite
free
from
the
tortured
whimpering
complaint
of
the
second
prelude
the
picture
is
small
but
the
subject
looms
large
in
meanings
the
fifth
prelude
in
d
is
chopin
at
his
happiest
its
arabesque
pattern
conveys
a
most
charming
content
and
there
is
a
dewy
freshness
a
joy
in
life
that
puts
to
flight
much
of
the
morbid
about
chopin
sickly
soul
the
few
bars
of
this
prelude
so
seldom
heard
in
public
reveal
musicianship
of
the
highest
order
the
harmonic
scheme
is
intricate
klindworth
phrases
the
first
four
bars
so
as
to
bring
out
the
alternate
b
and
b
flat
it
is
chopin
spinning
his
finest
his
most
iridescent
web
the
next
prelude
the
sixth
in
b
minor
is
doleful
pessimistic
as
george
sand
says
it
precipitates
the
soul
into
frightful
depression
it
is
the
most
frequently
played
and
oh
how
meaninglessly
prelude
of
the
set
this
and
the
one
in
d
flat
classical
is
its
repression
of
feeling
its
pure
contour
the
echo
effect
is
skilfully
managed
monotony
being
artfully
avoided
klindworth
rightfully
slurs
the
duple
group
of
eighths
kullak
tries
for
the
same
effect
by
different
means
the
duality
of
the
voices
should
be
clearly
expressed
the
tempo
marked
in
both
editions
lento
assai
is
fast
to
be
precise
klindworth
gives
to
the
quarter
the
plaintive
little
mazurka
of
two
lines
the
seventh
prelude
is
a
mere
silhouette
of
the
national
dance
yet
in
its
measures
is
compressed
all
mazovia
klindworth
makes
a
variant
in
the
fourth
bar
from
the
last
a
g
sharp
instead
of
an
f
sharp
it
is
a
more
piquant
climax
perhaps
not
admissible
to
the
chopin
purist
in
the
f
sharp
minor
prelude
no
chopin
gives
us
a
taste
of
his
grand
manner
for
niecks
the
piece
is
jerky
and
agitated
and
doubtless
suggests
a
mental
condition
bordering
on
anxiety
but
if
frenzy
there
is
it
is
kept
well
in
check
by
the
exemplary
taste
of
the
composer
the
sadness
is
rather
elegiac
remote
and
less
poignant
than
in
the
e
minor
prelude
harmonic
heights
are
reached
on
the
second
page
surely
wagner
knew
these
bars
when
he
wrote
tristan
and
isolde
while
the
ingenuity
of
the
figure
and
avoidance
of
a
rhythmical
monotone
are
evidences
of
chopin
feeling
for
the
decorative
it
is
a
masterly
prelude
klindworth
accents
the
first
of
the
bass
triplets
and
makes
an
unnecessary
enharmonic
change
at
the
sixth
and
seventh
lines
there
is
a
measure
of
grave
content
in
the
ninth
prelude
in
it
is
rather
gnomic
and
contains
hints
of
both
brahms
and
beethoven
it
has
an
ethical
quality
but
that
may
be
because
of
its
churchly
rhythm
and
color
the
c
sharp
minor
prelude
no
must
be
the
eagle
wings
of
schumann
critique
there
is
a
flash
of
steel
gray
deepening
into
black
and
then
the
vision
vanishes
as
though
some
huge
bird
aloft
had
plunged
down
through
blazing
sunlight
leaving
a
in
the
void
as
it
passed
to
its
quarry
or
to
be
less
figurative
this
prelude
is
a
study
in
arpeggio
with
double
notes
interspersed
and
is
too
short
to
make
more
than
a
vivid
impression
no
ii
in
b
is
all
too
brief
it
is
vivacious
dolce
indeed
and
most
cleverly
constructed
klindworth
gives
a
more
binding
character
to
the
first
double
notes
another
gleam
of
the
chopin
sunshine
storm
clouds
gather
in
the
g
sharp
minor
the
twelfth
prelude
so
unwittingly
imitated
by
grieg
in
his
menuetto
of
the
same
key
and
in
its
driving
presto
we
feel
the
passionate
clench
of
chopin
hand
it
is
convulsed
with
woe
but
the
intellectual
grip
the
are
never
lost
in
these
two
pages
of
perfect
writing
the
figure
is
suggestive
and
there
is
a
well
defined
technical
problem
as
well
as
a
psychical
character
disputed
territory
is
here
the
editors
do
not
agree
about
the
twelfth
and
eleventh
bars
from
the
last
according
to
breitkopf
hartel
the
bass
octaves

both

mikuli

instead
of

klindworth
g

the
second
time
riemann
e
and
also
kullak
the
g
sharp
seems
more
various
in
the
thirteenth
prelude
f
sharp
major
here
is
lovely
atmosphere
pure
and
peaceful
the
composer
has
found
mental
rest
exquisitely
poised
are
his
pinions
for
flight
and
in
the
piu
lento
he
wheels
significantly
and
majestically
about
in
the
blue
the
return
to
earth
is
the
signal
for
some
strange
modulatory
tactics
it
is
an
impressive
close
then
almost
without
pause
the
blood
begins
to
boil
in
this
fragile
man
veins
his
pulse
beat
increases
and
with
stifled
rage
he
rushes
into
the
battle
it
is
the
fourteenth
prelude
in
the
sinister
key
of
e
flat
minor
and
its
heavy
triplets
recalls
for
niecks
the
last
movement
of
the
b
flat
minor
sonata
but
there
is
less
interrogation
in
the
prelude
less
sophistication
and
the
heat
of
conflict
over
it
all
there
is
not
a
break
in
the
clouds
until
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
the
familiar
prelude
in
d
flat
this
must
be
george
sand
some
of
them
create
such
vivid
impressions
that
the
shades
of
dead
monks
seem
to
rise
and
pass
before
the
hearer
in
solemn
and
gloomy
funereal
pomp
the
work
needs
no
programme
its
serene
beginning
lugubrious
interlude
with
the
dominant
pedal
never
ceasing
a
basso
ostinato
gives
color
to
kleczynski
contention
that
the
prelude
in
b
minor
is
a
mere
sketch
of
the
idea
fully
elaborated
in
no
the
foundation
of
the
picture
is
the
drops
of
rain
falling
at
regular
intervals
the
echo
principle
again
which
by
their
continual
patter
bring
the
mind
to
a
state
of
sadness
a
melody
full
of
tears
is
heard
through
the
rush
of
the
rain
then
passing
to
the
key
of
c
sharp
minor
it
rises
from
the
depths
of
the
bass
to
a
prodigious
crescendo
indicative
of
the
terror
which
nature
in
its
deathly
aspect
excites
in
the
heart
of
man
here
again
the
form
does
not
allow
the
ideas
to
become
too
sombre
notwithstanding
the
melancholy
which
seizes
you
a
feeling
of
tranquil
grandeur
revives
you
to
niecks
the
c
sharp
minor
portion
affects
one
as
in
an
oppressive
dream
the
of
the
opening
d
flat
which
dispels
the
dreadful
nightmare
comes
upon
one
with
the
smiling
freshness
of
dear
familiar
nature
the
prelude
has
a
nocturnal
character
it
has
become
slightly
banal
from
frequent
repetition
likewise
the
c
sharp
minor
study
in
opus
but
of
its
beauty
balance
and
exceeding
chastity
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
architecture
is
at
once
greek
and
gothic
the
sixteenth
prelude
in
the
relative
key
of
b
flat
minor
is
the
boldest
of
the
set
its
scale
figures
seldom
employed
by
chopin
boil
and
glitter
the
thematic
thread
of
the
idea
never
being
quite
submerged
fascinating
full
of
perilous
acclivities
and
sudden
treacherous
descents
this
most
brilliant
of
preludes
is
chopin
in
riotous
spirits
he
plays
with
the
keyboard
it
is
an
avalanche
anon
a
cascade
then
a
swift
stream
which
finally
after
mounting
to
the
skies
descends
to
an
abyss
full
of
imaginative
lift
caprice
and
stormy
dynamics
this
prelude
is
the
darling
of
the
virtuoso
its
pregnant
introduction
is
like
a
madly
jutting
rock
from
which
the
eagle
spirit
of
the
composer
precipitates
itself
in
the

while
there

the

a
glimpse

be
noticed
that

changes

this

is
dramatic
almost
to
an
operatic
degree
sonorous
rather
grandiloquent
it

what
piano
music
is
the
nineteenth
prelude
in

its
widely
dispersed
harmonies
its
murmuring
grace
and
beauty
are
they
not
chopin
the
chopin
we
best
love
he
is
ever
the
necromancer
ever
invoking
phantoms
but
with
its
whirring
melody
and
furtive
caprice
this
particular
shape
is
an
alluring
one
and
difficult
it
is
to
interpret
with
all
its
plangent
lyric
freedom
no
in
c
minor
contains
in
its
thirteen
bars
the
sorrows
of
a
nation
it
is
without
doubt
a
sketch
for
a
funeral
march
and
of
it
george
sand
must
have
been
thinking
when
she
wrote
that
one
prelude
of

contained
more
music
than
all
the
trumpetings
of
meyerbeer
of
exceeding
loveliness
is
the

no
it
is
superior
in

the

judge
of
what
is
true
editorial
sciolism
when
i
tell
you
that
riemann
who
evidently
believes
in
a
rigid
melodic
structure
has
inserted
an
e
flat
at
the
end
of
bar
four
thus
maiming
the
tender
elusive
quality
of
chopin
theme
this
is
cruelly
pedantic
the
prelude
arrests
one
in
ecstasy
the
fixed
period
of
contemplation
of
the
saint
or
the
hypnotized
sets
in
and
the
awakening
is
almost
painful
chopin
adopting
the
relative
minor
key
as
a
pendant
to
the
picture
in

thrills
the
nerves
by
a
bold
dissonance
in
the
next
prelude
no

concise
paragraphs
filled
with
the
smoke
of
revolt
and

the
impetuosity
of
this
largely
moulded
piece
in
g

its
daring
harmonics
read
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
bars
and
dramatic
note
make
it
an
admirable
companion
to
the
prelude
in
f
minor
technically
it
serves
as
an
octave
study
for
the
left
hand
in
the
concluding
bar
but
one
chopin
has
in
the
f
major
prelude
attempted
a
most
audacious
feat
in
harmony
an
e
flat
in
the
bass
of
the
third
group
of
sixteenths
leaves
the
whole
composition
floating
enigmatically
in
thin
air
it
deliciously
colors
the
close
leaving
a
sense
of
suspense
of
anticipation
which
is
not
tonally
realized
for
the
succeeding
number
is
in
a
widely
divorced
key
but
it
must
have
pressed
hard
the
philistines
and
this
prelude
the
is
fashioned
out
of
the
most
volatile
stuff
aerial
imponderable
and
like
a
spider
web
oscillating
in
the
breeze
of
summer
its
hues
change
at
every
puff
it
is
in
extended
harmonics
and
must
be
delivered
with
spirituality
the
horny
hand
of
the
toilsome
pianist
would
shatter
the
delicate
swinging
fantasy
of
the
poet
kullak
points
out
a
variant
in
the
fourteenth
bar
g
instead
of
b
natural
being
used
by
riemann
klindworth
prefers
the
latter
we
have
reached
the
last
prelude
of
op
in
d
minor
it
is
sonorously
tragic
troubled
by
fevers
and
visions
and
capricious
irregular
and
massive
in
design
it
may
be
placed
among
greater
works
the
two
etudes
in
c
minor
the
a
minor
and
the
f
sharp
minor
prelude
the
bass
requires
an
unusual
span
and
the
suggestion
by
kullak
that
the
thumb
of
the
right
hand
may
eke
out
the
weakness
of
the
left
is
only
for
the
timid
and
the
small
of
fist
but
i
do
not
counsel
following
his
two
variants
in
the
fifth
and
bars
chopin
text
is
more
telling
like
the
vast
reverberation
of
monstrous
waves
on
the
implacable
coast
of
a
remote
world
is
this
prelude
despite
its
fatalistic
ring
its
note
of
despair
is
not
dispiriting
its
issues
are
larger
more
impersonal
more
elemental
than
the
other
preludes
it
is
a
veritable
appassionata
but
its
theatre
is
cosmic
and
no
longer
behind
the
closed
doors
of
the
cabinet
of
chopin
soul
the
seelenschrei
of
stanislaw
przybyszewski
is
here
explosions
of
wrath
and
revolt
not
chopin
suffers
but
his
countrymen
kleczynski
speaks
of
the
three
tones
at
the
close
they
are
the
final
clangor
of
oppressed
almost
overthrown
reason
after
the
subject
reappears
in
c
minor
there
is
a
shift
to
d
flat
and
for
a
moment
a
point
of
repose
is
gained
but
this
elusive
rest
is
brief
the
theme
reappears
in
the
tonic
and
in
octaves
and
the
tension
becomes
too
great
the
accumulated
passion
discharges
and
dissolves
in
a
fierce
gust
of
double
chromatic
thirds
and
octaves
powerful
repellant
this
prelude
is
almost
infernal
in
its
pride
and
scorn
but
in
it
i
discern
no
vestige
of
uncontrolled
hysteria
it
is
as
strong
rank
and
human
as
beethoven
the
various
editorial
phraseology
is
not
of
much
moment
riemann
uses
notes
for
the
cadenzas
kullak
eighths
and
klindworth
sixteenths
niecks
writes
of
the
prelude
in
c
sharp
minor
op
that
it
deserves
its
name
better
than
almost
any
one
of
the
still
i
would
rather
call
it
improvisata
it
seems
unpremeditated
a
heedless
outpouring
when
sitting
at
the
piano
in
a
lonely
dreary
hour
perhaps
in
the
twilight
the
quaver
figure
rises
aspiringly
and
the
sustained
parts
swell
out
proudly
the
piquant
cadenza
forestalls
in
the
progression
of
diminished
chords
favorite
effects
of
some
of
our
more
modern
composers
the
modulation
from
c
sharp
minor
to
d
major
and
back
again
after
the
cadenza
is
very
striking
and
equally
beautiful
elsewhere
i
have
called
attention
to
the
brahmsian
coloring
of
this
prelude
its
mood
is
fugitive
and
hard
to
hold
after
capture
recondite
it
is
and
not
music
for
the
multitude
niecks
does
not
think
chopin
created
a
new
type
in
the
preludes
they
are
too
unlike
each
other
in
form
and
character
yet
notwithstanding
the
fleeting
evanescent
moods
of
the
preludes
there
is
designedly
a
certain
unity
of
feeling
and
contrasted
tonalities
all
being
grouped
in
approved
manner
this
may
be
demonstrated
by
playing
them
through
at
a
sitting
which
arthur
friedheim
the
russian
virtuoso
did
in
a
concert
with
excellent
effect
as
if
wishing
to
exhibit
his
genius
in
perspective
chopin
carved
these
cameos
with
exceeding
fineness
exceeding
care
in
a
few
of
them
the
idea
overbalances
the
form
but
the
greater
number
are
exquisite
examples
of
a
just
proportion
of
manner
and
matter
a
true
blending
of
voice
and
vision
even
in
the
more
microscopic
ones
the
tracery
echoing
like
the
spirals
in
strange
seashells
is
marvellously
measured
much
in
miniature
are
these
sculptured
preludes
of
the
polish
poet
viii
impromptus
and
valses
to
write
of
the
four
impromptus
in
their
own
key
of
unrestrained
feeling
and
pondered
intention
would
not
be
as
easy
as
recapturing
the
first
careless
rapture
of
the
lark
with
all
the
freedom
of
an
improvisation
the
chopin
impromptu
has
a
well
defined
form
there
is
structural
impulse
although
the
patterns
are
free
and
original
the
is
not
much
varied
in
three
the
first
third
and
fourth
but
in
the
second
there
is
a
quality
that
hints
of
the
tragic
the
a
flat
impromptu
op
is
if
one
is
pinned
down
to
the
title
the
happiest
named
of
the
set
its
seething
prankish
nimble
bubbling
quality
is
indicated
from
the
start
the
d
natural
in
the
treble
against
the
c
and
e
flat
the
dominant
in
the
bass
is
a
most
original
effect
and
the
flowing
triplets
of
the
first
part
of
this
piece
give
a
ductile
gracious
character
to
it
the
chromatic
involutions
are
many
and
interesting
when
the
f
minor
part
is
reached
the
ear
experiences
the
relief
of
a
strongly
contrasted
rhythm
the
simple
duple
measure
so
naturally
ornamented
is
nobly
broadly
melodious
after
the
return
of
the
first
dimpling
theme
there
is
a
short
coda
a
chiaroscura
and
then
with
a
few
chords
the
composition
goes
to
rest
a
bird
flew
that
way
rubato
should
be
employed
for
as
kleczynski
says
here
everything
totters
from
foundation
to
summit
and
everything
is
nevertheless
so
beautiful
and
so
clear
but
only
an
artist
with
velvety
fingers
should
play
this
sounding
arabesque
there
is
more
limpidezza
more
pure
grace
of
line
in
the
first
impromptu
than
in
the
second
in
f
sharp
op
here
symmetry
is
abandoned
as
kullak
remarks
but
the
compensation
of
intenser
emotional
issues
is
offered
there
is
something
in
the
pose
of
this
work
its
nocturnal
beginning
with
the
bass
a
bass
that
ever
recalls
to
me
the
faint
buried
tones
of
sunken
bell
the
sweetly
grave
close
of
the
section
the
faint
of
an
approaching
cavalcade
with
the
swelling
thunders
of
its
passage
surely
suggests
a
narrative
a
programme
after
the
d
major
episode
there
are
two
bars
of
anonymous
modulation
these
bars
creak
on
their
hinges
and
the
first
subject
reappears
in
f
then
climbs
to
f
sharp
thence
merges
into
a
glittering
melodic
exciting
brilliant
the
whole
subsiding
into
an
echo
of
earlier
harmonies
the
final
octaves
are
marked
fortissimo
which
always
seems
brutal
yet
its
logic
lies
in
the
scheme
of
the
composer
perhaps
he
wished
to
arouse
us
harshly
from
his
dreamland
as
was
his
habit
while
improvising
for
friends
a
glissando
would
send
them
home
shivering
after
an
evening
of
delicious
reverie
niecks
finds
this
impromptu
lacking
the
pith
of
the
first
to
me
it
is
of
more
moment
than
the
other
three
it
is
irregular
and
wavering
in
outline
the
moods
are
wandering
and
capricious
yet
who
dares
deny
its
power
its
beauty
in
its
use
of
accessory
figures
it
does
not
reveal
so
much
ingenuity
but
just
because
the
figure
in
the
carpet
is
not
so
varied
in
pattern
its
passion
is
all
the
deeper
it
is
another
ballade
sadder
more
meditative
of
the
tender
grace
of
vanished
days
the
third
impromptu
in
g
flat
op
is
not
often
played
it
may
be
too
difficult
for
the
vandal
with
an
average
technique
but
it
is
neither
so
fresh
in
feeling
nor
so
spontaneous
in
utterance
as
its
companions
there
is
a
touch
of
the
faded
blase
and
it
is
hardly
healthy
in
sentiment
here
are
some
ophidian
curves
in
triplets
as
in
the
first
impromptu
but
with
interludes
of
double
notes
in
coloring
tropical
and
rich
to
morbidity
the
e
flat
minor
trio
is
a
fine
bit
of
melodic
writing
the
absence
of
simplicity
is
counterbalanced
by
greater
freedom
of
modulation
and
complexity
of
pattern
the
impromptu
flavor
is
not
missing
and
there
is
allied
to
delicacy
of
design
a
strangeness
of
sentiment
that
strangeness
which
edgar
poe
declared
should
be
a
constituent
element
of
all
great
art
the
in
c
sharp
minor
op
was
published
by
fontana
in
and
is
one
of
the
few
posthumous
works
of
chopin
worthy
of
consideration
it
was
composed
about
a
true
impromptu
but
the
title
of
fantaisie
given
by
fontana
is
superfluous
the
piece
presents
difficulties
chiefly
rhythmical
its
involuted
first
phrases
suggest
the
fioriture
so
dear
to
chopin
but
the
d
flat
part
is
without
nobility
here
is
the
same
kind
of
saccharine
melody
that
makes
mawkish
the
trio
in
the
marche
funebre
there
seems
no
danger
that
this
will
suffer
from
neglect
for
it
is
the
joy
of
the
piano
student
who
turns
its
presto
into
a
slow
blurred
mess
of
badly
related
rhythms
and
its
slower
movement
into
a
long
drawn
sentimental
agony
but
in
the
hands
of
a
master
the
c
sharp
minor
impromptu
is
charming
though
not
of
great
depth
the
first
impromptu
dedicated
to
mlle
la
comtesse
de
lobau
was
published
december
the
second
may
the
third
dedicated
to
madame
la
comtesse
esterhazy
february
not
one
of
these
four
impromptus
is
as
naive
as
schubert
they
are
more
sophisticated
and
do
not
smell
of
nature
and
her
simplicities
of
the
chopin
valses
it
has
been
said
that
they
are
dances
of
the
soul
and
not
of
the
body
their
animated
rhythms
insouciant
airs
and
brilliant
coquettish
atmosphere
the
true
atmosphere
of
the
ballroom
seem
to
smile
at
ehlert
poetic
exaggeration
the
valses
are
the
most
objective
of
the
chopin
works
and
in
few
of
them
is
there
more
than
a
hint
of
the
sullen
sargasson
seas
of
the
nocturnes
and
scherzi
nietzsche
la
gaya
scienza
the
gay
science
is
beautifully
set
forth
in
the
fifteen
chopin
valses
they
are
less
intimate
in
the
psychic
sense
but
exquisite
exemplars
of
social
intimacy
and
aristocratic
abandon
as
schumann
declared
the
dancers
of
these
valses
should
be
at
least
countesses
there
is
a
reserve
despite
their
intoxication
and
never
a
hint
of
the
brawling
peasants
of
beethoven
grieg
brahms
tschaikowsky
and
the
rest
but
little
of
vienna
is
in
chopin
around
the
measures
of
this
most
popular
of
dances
he
has
thrown
mystery
allurement
and
in
them
secret
whisperings
and
the
unconscious
sigh
it
is
going
too
far
not
to
dance
to
some
of
this
music
for
it
is
putting
chopin
away
from
the
world
he
at
times
loved
certain
of
the
valses
may
be
danced
the
first
second
fifth
sixth
and
a
few
others
the
dancing
would
be
of
necessity
more
picturesque
and
less
conventional
than
required
by
the
average
valse
and
there
must
be
fluctuations
of
tempo
sudden
surprises
and
abrupt
languors
the
mazurkas
and
polonaises
are
danced
in
poland
why
not
the
valses
chopin
genius
reveals
itself
in
these
dance
forms
and
their
presentation
should
be
not
solely
a
psychic
one
kullak
stern
old
pedagogue
divides
these
dances
into
two
groups
the
first
dedicated
to
terpsichore
the
second
a
frame
for
moods
chopin
admitted
that
he
was
unable
to
play
valses
in
the
viennese
fashion
yet
he
has
contrived
to
rival
strauss
in
his
own
genre
some
of
these
valses
are
trivial
artificial
most
of
them
are
bred
of
candlelight
and
the
swish
of
silken
attire
and
a
few
are
poetically
morbid
and
stray
across
the
border
into
the
rhythms
of
the
mazurka
all
of
them
have
been
edited
to
death
reduced
to
the
commonplace
by
vulgar
methods
of
performance
but
are
altogether
sprightly
delightful
specimens
of
the
careless
vagrant
and
happy
moods
kullak
utters
words
of
warning
to
the
unquiet
sex
regarding
the
habitual
neglect
of
the
bass
it
should
mean
something
in
valse
tempo
but
it
usually
does
not
nor
need
it
be
brutally
banged
the
fundamental
tone
must
be
cared
for
the
subsidiary
harmonies
lightly
indicated
the
rubato
in
the
valses
need
not
obtrude
itself
as
in
the
mazurkas
opus
in
e
flat
was
published
in
june
and
dedicated
to
mile
laura
harsford
it
is
a
true
ballroom
picture
spirited
and
infectious
in
rhythms
schumann
wrote
rhapsodically
of
it
the
d
flat
section
has
a
tang
of
the
later
chopin
there
is
bustle
even
chatter
in
this
valse
which
in
form
and
content
is
inferior
to
op
no
i
a
flat
the
three
valses
of
this
set
were
published
december
there
are
many
editorial
differences
in
the
a
flat
valse
owing
to
the
careless
way
it
was
copied
and
pirated
klindworth
and
kullak
are
the
safest
for
dynamic
markings
this
valse
may
be
danced
as
far
as
its
dithyrhambic
coda
notice
in
this
coda
as
in
many
other
places
the
debt
schumann
owes
chopin
for
a
certain
passage
in
the
preambule
of
his
carneval
the
next
valse
in
a
minor
has
a
tinge
of
sarmatian
melancholy
indeed
it
is
one
of
chopin
most
desponding
moods
the
episode
in
c
rings
of
the
mazurka
and
the
a
major
section
is
of
exceeding
loveliness
its
coda
is
characteristic
this
valse
is
a
favorite
and
who
need
wonder
the
f
major
valse
the
last
of
this
series
is
a
whirling
wild
dance
of
atoms
it
has
the
perpetuum
mobile
quality
and
older
masters
would
have
prolonged
its
giddy
arabesques
into
pages
of
senseless
spinning
it
is
quite
long
enough
as
it
is
the
second
theme
is
better
but
the
appoggiatures
are
flippant
it
buzzes
to
the
finish
of
it
is
related
that
chopin
cat
sprang
upon
his
keyboard
and
in
its
feline
flight
gave
him
the
idea
of
the
first
measures
i
suppose
as
there
is
a
dog
valse
there
had
to
be
one
for
the
cat
but
as
rossini
would
have
said
ca
sent
de
scarlatti
the
a
minor
valse
was
of
the
three
chopin
favorite
when
stephen
heller
told
him
this
too
was
his
beloved
valse
chopin
was
greatly
pleased
inviting
the
hungarian
composer
niecks
relates
to
luncheon
at
the
cafe
riche
not
improvised
in
the
ballroom
as
the
preceding
yet
a
marvellous
epitome
is
the
a
flat
valse
op
published
july
it
is
the
best
rounded
specimen
of
chopin
experimenting
with
the
form
the
prolonged
trill
on
e
flat
summoning
us
to
the
ballroom
the
suggestive
intermingling
of
rhythms
duple
and
triple
the
coquetry
hesitation
passionate
avowal
and
the
superb
coda
with
its
echoes
of
evening
have
not
these
episodes
a
charm
beyond
compare
only
schumann
in
certain
pages
of
his
carneval
seizes
the
secret
of
young
life
and
love
but
his
is
not
so
finished
so
glowing
a
tableau
regarding
certain
phrasing
of
this
valse
moriz
rosenthal
wrote
to
the
london
musical
standard
in
music
there
is
liberty
and
fraternity
but
seldom
equality
and
in
music
social
democracy
has
no
voice
notes
have
a
right
to
the
aftertone
nachton
and
this
right
depends
upon
their
role
in
the
key
the
vorhalt
accented
passing
note
will
always
have
an
accent
on
this
point
riemann
must
without
question
be
considered
right
likewise
the
feeling
player
will
mark
those
notes
that
introduce
the
transition
to
another
key
we
will
consider
now
our
example
and
set
down
my
accents
musical
score
excerpt
in
the
first
bar
we
have
the
tonic
chord
of
its
major
key
as
bass
and
are
thus
not
forced
to
any
accent
in
the
second
bar
we
have
the
dominant
harmony
in
the
bass
and
in
the
treble
c
which
falls
upon
the
down
beat
as
vorhalt
to
the
next
tone
b
flat
so
it
must
be
accented
also
in
the
fourth
bar
the
b
flat
is
vorhalt
to
the
b
flat
and
likewise
requires
an
accent
in
bars
and
the
notes
a
flat
b
flat
and
c
are
without
doubt
the
characteristic
ones
of
the
passage
and
the
e
flat
has
in
each
case
only
a
secondary
significance
that
a
genius
like
chopin
did
not
indicate
everything
accurately
is
quite
explainable
he
flew
where
we
merely
limp
after
moreover
these
accents
must
be
felt
rather
than
executed
with
softest
touch
and
as
tenderly
as
possible
the
d
flat
valse
le
valse
du
petit
chien
is
of
george
sand
own
prompting
one
evening
at
her
home
in
the
square
she
was
amused
by
her
little
pet
dog
chasing
its
tail
she
begged
chopin
her
little
pet
pianist
to
set
the
tail
to
music
he
did
so
and
behold
the
world
is
richer
for
this
piece
i
do
not
dispute
the
story
it
seems
well
grounded
but
then
it
is
so
ineffably
silly
the
three
valses
of
this
op
were
published
september
and
are
respectively
dedicated
to
the
comtesse
delphine
potocka
the
baronne
nathaniel
de
rothschild
and
the
baronne
bronicka
i
shall
not
presume
to
speak
of
the
execution
of
the
d
flat
valse
like
the
rich
it
is
always
with
us
it
is
usually
taken
at
a
meaningless
rapid
gait
i
have
heard
it
played
by
a
genuine
chopin
pupil
georges
mathias
and
he
did
not
take
it
prestissimo
he
ran
up
the
d
flat
scale
ending
with
a
sforzato
at
the
top
and
gave
a
variety
of
nuance
to
the
composition
the
cantabile
is
nearly
always
delivered
with
sloppiness
of
sentiment
this
valse
has
been
served
up
in
a
highly
indigestible
condition
for
concert
purposes
by
tausig
joseffy
whose
arrangement
was
the
first
to
be
heard
here
theodore
ritter
rosenthal
and
isidor
philipp
the
c
sharp
minor
valse
is
the
most
poetic
of
all
the
first
theme
has
never
been
excelled
by
chopin
for
a
species
of
veiled
melancholy
it
is
a
fascinating
lyrical
sorrow
and
what
kullak
calls
the
psychologic
motivation
of
the
first
theme
in
the
curving
figure
of
the
second
does
not
relax
the
spell
a
space
of
clearer
skies
warmer
more
consoling
winds
are
in
the
d
flat
interlude
but
the
spirit
of
unrest
ennui
returns
the
elegiac
imprint
is
unmistakable
in
this
soul
dance
the
a
flat
valse
which
follows
is
charming
it
is
for
superior
souls
who
dance
with
intellectual
joy
with
the
joy
that
comes
of
making
exquisite
patterns
and
curves
out
of
the
salon
and
from
its
brilliantly
lighted
spaces
the
dancers
do
not
wander
do
not
dance
into
the
darkness
and
churchyard
as
ehlert
imagines
of
certain
other
valses
the
two
valses
in
op
three

op
and
the
two
remaining
valses
in

and

need
not
detain
us
they
are
posthumous
the

the

no
has
a
charm
of
its

this

is
suavely
melancholy
but
not
so
melancholy
as
the

of
the

it
recalls
in
color
the

very
gay

sprightly

the

while
the

as

out
germs
of
the

and
the
op

it
recalls
to
me
the
d

study
in
the
supplementary
series
the
e

valse
without

is
beloved
it
is
very
graceful
and
not
without
sentiment
the
major
part
is
the

chopin
the

valse
is
published
in
the
mikuli
edition
it
is
commonplace
hinting
of
its
composer
only
in
places
thus
ends
the
collection
of
valses
not
chopin
most
signal
success
in

but
a
success
that
has
dignified
and
given
beauty

as

specimens
of
nocturnes
john
field
has
been
described
as
the
forerunner
of
chopin
the
limpid
style
of
this
pupil
and
friend
of
clementi
his
beautiful
touch
and
finished
execution
were
certainly
admired
and
imitated
by
the
pole
field
nocturnes
are
now
neglected
so
curious
are
caprices
and
without
warrant
for
not
only
is
field
the
creator
of
the
form
but
in
both
his
concertos
and
nocturnes
he
has
written
charming
sweet
and
sane
music
he
rather
patronized
chopin
for
whose
melancholy
pose
he
had
no
patience
he
has
a
talent
of
the
hospital
growled
field
in
the
intervals
between
his
wine
drinking
pipe
smoking
and
the
washing
of
his
linen
the
latter
economical
habit
he
contracted
from
clementi
there
is
some
truth
in
his
stricture
chopin
seldom
exuberantly
cheerful
is
morbidly
sad
and
complaining
in
many
of
the
nocturnes
the
most
admired
of
his
compositions
with
the
exception
of
the
valses
they
are
in
several
instances
his
weakest
yet
he
ennobled
the
form
originated
by
field
giving
it
dramatic
breadth
passion
and
even
grandeur
set
against
field
naive
and
idyllic
specimens
chopin
efforts
are
often
too
bejewelled
for
true
simplicity
too
lugubrious
too
tropical
asiatic
is
a
better
word
and
they
have
the
exotic
savor
of
the
heated
conservatory
and
not
the
fresh
scent
of
the
flowers
reared
in
the
open
by
the
less
poetic
irishman
and
then
chopin
is
so
desperately
sentimental
in
some
of
these
compositions
they
are
not
altogether
to
the
taste
of
this
generation
they
seem
to
be
suffering
from
anaemia
however
there
are
a
few
noble
nocturnes
and
methods
of
performance
may
have
much
to
answer
for
the
sentimentalizing
of
some
others
more
vigor
a
quickening
of
the
and
a
less
languishing
touch
will
rescue
them
from
lush
sentiment
chopin
loved
the
night
and
its
soft
mysteries
as
much
as
did
robert
louis
stevenson
and
his
nocturnes
are
true
night
pieces
some
with
agitated
remorseful
countenance
others
seen
in
profile
only
while
many
are
whisperings
at
dusk
most
of
them
are
called
feminine
a
term
psychologically
false
the
poetic
side
of
men
of
genius
is
feminine
and
in
chopin
the
feminine
note
was
over
emphasized
at
times
it
was
almost
hysterical
particularly
in
these
nocturnes
the
scotch
have
a
proverb
she
wove
her
shroud
and
wore
it
in
her
lifetime
in
the
nocturnes
the
shroud
is
not
far
away
chopin
wove
his
to
the
day
of
his
death
and
he
wore
it
sometimes
but
not
always
as
many
think
one
of
the
most
elegiac
of
his
nocturnes
is
the
first
in
b
flat
minor
it
is
one
of
three
op
dedicated
to
mme
camille
pleyel
of
far
more
significance
than
its
two
companions
it
is
for
some
reason
neglected
while
i
am
far
from
agreeing
with
those
who
hold
that
in
the
early
chopin
all
his
genius
was
completely
revealed
yet
this
nocturne
is
as
striking
as
the
last
for
it
is
at
once
sensuous
and
dramatic
melancholy
and
lovely
emphatically
a
mood
it
is
best
heard
on
a
gray
day
of
the
soul
when
the
times
are
out
of
joint
its
silken
tones
will
bring
a
triste
content
as
they
pour
out
upon
one
hearing
the
second
section
in
octaves
is
of
exceeding
charm
as
a
melody
it
has
all
the
lurking
voluptuousness
and
mystic
crooning
of
its
composer
there
is
flux
and
reflux
throughout
passion
peeping
out
in
the
coda
the
e
flat
nocturne
is
graceful
shallow
of
content
but
if
it
is
played
with
purity
of
touch
and
freedom
from
sentimentality
it
is
not
nearly
so
banal
as
it
usually
seems
it
is
therefore
play
it
as
did
rubinstein
in
a
fashion
hadow
calls
attention
to
the
remote
and
recondite
modulations
in
the
twelfth
bar
the
chromatic
double
notes
for
him
they
only
are
one
real
modulation
the
rest
of
the
passage
is
an
iridescent
play
of
color
an
effect
of
superficies
not
an
effect
of
substance
it
was
the
e
flat
nocturne
that
unloosed
rellstab
critical
wrath
in
the
iris
of
it
he
wrote
where
field
smiles
chopin
makes
a
grinning
grimace
where
field
sighs
chopin
groans
where
field
shrugs
his
shoulders
chopin
twists
his
whole
body
where
field
puts
some
seasoning
into
the
food
chopin
empties
a
handful
of
cayenne
pepper
in
short
if
one
holds
field
charming
romances
before
a
distorting
concave
mirror
so
that
every
delicate
impression
becomes
a
coarse
one
one
gets
chopin
work
we
implore
chopin
to
return
to
nature
rellstab
might
have
added
that
while
field
was
often
commonplace
chopin
never
was
rather
is
to
be
preferred
the
sound
judgment
of
davison
the
english
critic
and
husband
of
the
pianist
arabella
goddard
of
the
early
works
he
wrote
commonplace
is
instinctively
avoided
in
all
the
works
of
chopin
a
stale
cadence
or
a
trite
progression
a
subject
or
a
passage
a
vulgar
twist
of
the
melody
or
a
hackneyed
sequence
a
meagre
harmony
or
an
unskilful
counterpoint
may
in
vain
be
looked
for
throughout
the
entire
range
of
his
compositions
the
prevailing
characteristics
of
which
are
a
feeling
as
uncommon
as
beautiful
a
treatment
as
original
as
felicitous
a
melody
and
a
harmony
as
new
fresh
vigorous
and
striking
as
they
are
utterly
unexpected
and
out
of
the
original
track
in
taking
up
one
of
the
works
of
chopin
you
are
entering
as
it
were
a
fairyland
untrodden
by
human
footsteps
a
path
hitherto
unfrequented
but
by
the
great
composer
himself
gracious
even
coquettish
is
the
first
part
of
the
b
major
nocturne
of
this
opus
well
knit
the
passionate
intermezzo
has
the
true
dramatic
chopin
ring
it
should
be
taken
alla
breve
the
ending
is
quite
effective
i
do
not
care
much
for
the
f
major
nocturne
op
no
i
the
opus
is
dedicated
to
ferdinand
hiller
ehlert
speaks
of
the
ornament
in
triplets
with
which
he
brushes
the
theme
as
with
the
gentle
wings
of
a
butterfly
and
then
discusses
the
artistic
value
of
the
ornament
which
may
be
so
profitably
studied
in
the
chopin
music
from
its
nature
the
ornament
can
only
beautify
the
beautiful
music
like
chopin
with
its
predominating
elegance
could
not
forego
ornament
but
he
surely
did
not
purchase
it
of
a
jeweller
he
designed
it
himself
with
a
delicate
hand
he
was
the
first
to
surround
a
note
with
diamond
facets
and
to
weave
the
rushing
floods
of
his
emotions
with
the
silver
beams
of
the
moonlight
in
his
nocturnes
there
is
a
glimmering
as
of
distant
stars
from
these
dreamy
heavenly
gems
he
has
borrowed
many
a
line
the
chopin
nocturne
is
a
dramatized
ornament
and
why
may
not
art
speak
for
once
in
such
symbols
in
the
much
admired
f
sharp
major
nocturne
the
principal
theme
makes
its
appearance
so
richly
decorated
that
one
can
not
avoid
imagining
that
his
fancy
confined
itself
to
the
arabesque
form
for
the
expression
of
its
poetical
sentiments
even
the
middle
part
borders
upon
what
i
should
call
the
tragic
style
of
ornament
the
ground
thought
is
hidden
behind
a
dense
veil
but
a
veil
too
can
be
an
ornament
in
another
place
ehlert
thinks
that
the
f
sharp
major
nocturne
seems
inseparable
from
champagne
and
truffles
it
is
certainly
more
elegant
and
dramatic
than
the
one
in
f
major
which
precedes
it
that
with
the
exception
of
the
middle
part
in
f
minor
is
weak
although
rather
pretty
and
confiding
the
f
sharp
nocturne
is
popular
the
doppio
movemento
is
extremely
striking
and
the
entire
piece
is
saturated
with
young
life
love
and
feelings
of
good
will
to
men
read
kleczynski
the
third
nocturne
of
the
three
is
in
g
minor
and
contains
some
fine
picturesque
writing
kullak
does
not
find
in
it
aught
of
the
fantastic
the
languid
voice
of
the
opening
and
the
churchly
refrain
of
the
chorale
is
not
this
fantastic
contrast
this
nocturne
contains
in
solution
all
that
chopin
developed
later
in
a
nocturne
of
the
same
key
but
i
think
the
first
stronger
its
lines
are
simpler
more
primitive
its
coloring
less
complicated
yet
quite
as
rich
and
gloomy
of
it
chopin
said
after
hamlet
but
changed
his
mind
let
them
guess
for
themselves
was
his
sensible
conclusion
kullak
programme
has
a
conventional
ring
it
is
the
lament
for
the
beloved
one
the
lost
lenore
with
the
consolation
of
religion
thrown
in
the
of
the
plain
chant
bring
to
my
mind
little
that
consoles
although
the
piece
ends
in
the
major
mode
it
is
like
poe
ulalume
a
complete
and
tiny
tone
poem
rubinstein
made
much
of
it
in
the
fourth
bar
and
for
three
bars
there
is
a
held
note
f
and
i
heard
the
russian
virtuoso
by
some
miraculous
means
keep
this
tone
prolonged
the
tempo
is
abnormally
slow
and
the
tone
is
not
in
a
position
where
the
sustaining
pedal
can
sensibly
help
it
yet
under
rubinstein
fingers
it
swelled
and
diminished
and
went
singing
into
d
as
if
the
instrument
were
an
organ
i
suspected
the
inaudible
changing
of
fingers
on
the
note
or
a
sustaining
pedal
it
was
wonderfully
done
the
next
nocturne
op
no
i
brings
us
before
a
masterpiece
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
c
minor
nocturne
this
one
in
the
sombre
key
of
c
sharp
minor
is
the
great
essay
in
the
form
kleczynski
finds
it
a
description
of
a
calm
night
at
venice
where
after
a
scene
of
murder
the
sea
closes
over
a
corpse
and
continues
to
serve
as
a
mirror
to
the
moonlight
this
is
melodramatic
willeby
analyzes
it
at
length
with
the
scholarly
fervor
of
an
english
organist
he
finds
the
accompaniment
to
be
mostly
on
a
double
pedal
and
remarks
that
higher
art
than
this
one
could
not
have
if
simplicity
of
means
be
a
factor
of
high
art
the
figure
of
the
left
hand
supports
a
morbid
persistent
melody
that
grates
on
the
nerves
from
the
piu
mosso
the
agitation
increases
and
here
let
me
call
to
your
notice
the
quality
of
these
bars
which
continue
until
the
change
of
signature
there
is
a
surprising
climax
followed
by
sunshine
and
favor
in
the
d
flat
part
then
after
mounting
dissonances
a
bold
succession
of
octaves
returns
to
the
feverish
plaint
of
the
opening
kullak
speaks
of
a
resemblance
to
meyerbeer
song
le
moine
the
composition
reaches
exalted
states
its
psychological
tension
is
so
great
at
times
as
to
border
on
a
pathological
condition
there
is
unhealthy
power
in
this
nocturne
which
is
seldom
interpreted
with
sinister
subtlety
henry
finck
rightfully
thinks
it
embodies
a
greater
variety
of
emotion
and
more
genuine
dramatic
spirit
on
four
pages
than
many
operas
on
four
hundred
the
companion
picture
in
d
flat
op
no
has
as
karasowski
writes
a
profusion
of
delicate
fioriture
it
really
contains
but
one
subject
and
is
a
song
of
the
sweet
summer
of
two
souls
for
there
is
obvious
meaning
in
the
duality
of
voices
often
heard
in
the
concert
room
this
nocturne
gives
us
a
surfeit
of
sixths
and
thirds
of
elaborate
ornamentation
and
monotone
of
mood
yet
it
is
a
lovely
imploring
melody
and
harmonically
most
interesting
a
curious
marking
and
usually
overlooked
by
pianists
is
the
crescendo
and
con
forza
of
the
cadenza
this
is
obviously
erroneous
the
theme
which
occurs
three
times
should
first
be
piano
then
pianissimo
and
lastly
forte
this
opus
is
dedicated
to
the
comtesse
the
best
part
of
the
next
nocturne
b
major
op
no
i
dedicated
to
madame
de
billing
is
the
coda
it
is
in
the
minor
and
is
like
the
of
tragedy
the
entire
ending
a
stormy
recitative
is
in
stern
contrast
to
the
dreamy
beginning
kullak
in
the
first
bar
of
the
last
line
uses
a
g
fontana
f
sharp
and
klindworth
the
same
as
kullak
the
nocturne
that
follows
in
a
flat
is
a
reversion
to
the
field
type
the
opening
recalling
that
master
b
flat
nocturne
the
f
minor
section
of
chopin
broadens
out
to
dramatic
reaches
but
as
an
entirety
this
opus
is
a
little
tiresome
nor
do
i
admire
inordinately
the
nocturne
in
g
minor
op
no
it
has
a
complaining
tone
and
the
choral
is
not
noteworthy
this
particular
part
so
chopin
pupil
gutmann
declared
is
taken
too
slowly
the
composer
having
forgotten
to
mark
the
increased
tempo
but
the
nocturne
in
g
op
no
is
charming
painted
with
chopin
most
ethereal
brush
without
the
cloying
splendors
of
the
one
in
d
flat
the
double
sixths
fourths
and
thirds
are
magically
euphonious
the
second
subject
i
agree
with
karasowski
is
the
most
beautiful
melody
chopin
ever
wrote
it
is
in
true
barcarolle
vein
and
most
subtle
are
the
shifting
harmonic
hues
pianists
usually
take
the
first
part
too
fast
the
second
too
slowly
transforming
this
poetic
composition
into
an
etude
as
schumann
wrote
of
this
opus
the
two
nocturnes
differ
from
his
earlier
ones
chiefly
through
greater
simplicity
of
decoration
and
more
quiet
grace
we
know
fondness
in
general
for
spangles
gold
trinkets
and
pearls
he
has
already
changed
and
grown
older
decoration
he
still
loves
but
it
is
of
a
more
judicious
kind
behind
which
the
nobility
of
the
poetry
shimmers
through
with
all
the
more
loveliness
indeed
taste
the
finest
must
be
granted
him
both
numbers
of
this
opus
are
without
dedication
they
are
the
offspring
of
the
trip
to
majorca
niecks
writing
of
the
g
major
nocturne
adjures
us
not
to
tarry
too
long
in
the
treacherous
atmosphere
of
this
capua
it
bewitches
and
unmans
kleczynski
calls
the
one
in
g
minor
homesickness
while
the
celebrated
nocturne
in
c
minor
is
the
tale
of
a
still
greater
grief
told
in
an
agitated
recitando
celestial
harps
ah
i
hear
the
squeak
of
the
old
romantic
machinery
come
to
bring
one
ray
of
hope
which
is
powerless
in
its
endeavor
to
calm
the
wounded
soul
which
sends
forth
to
heaven
a
cry
of
deepest
anguish
it
doubtless
has
its
despairing
movement
this
same
nocturne
in
c
minor
op
no
i
but
karasowski
is
nearer
right
when
he
calls
it
broad
and
most
imposing
with
its
powerful
intermediate
movement
a
thorough
departure
from
the
nocturne
style
willeby
finds
it
sickly
and
labored
and
even
niecks
does
not
think
it
should
occupy
a
foremost
place
among
its
companions
the
ineluctable
fact
remains
that
this
is
the
noblest
nocturne
of
them
all
biggest
in
conception
it
seems
a
miniature
music
drama
it
requires
the
grand
manner
to
read
it
adequately
and
the
doppio
movemento
is
exciting
to
a
dramatic
degree
i
fully
agree
with
kullak
that
too
strict
adherence
to
the
marking
of
this
section
produces
the
effect
of
an
inartistic
precipitation
which
robs
the
movement
of
clarity
kleczynski
calls
the
work
the
contrition
of
a
sinner
and
devotes
several
pages
to
its
elucidation
de
lenz
chats
most
entertainingly
with
tausig
about
it
indeed
an
imposing
march
of
splendor
is
the
second
subject
in
a
fitting
pendant
is
this
work
to
the
c
sharp
minor
nocturne
both
have
the
heroic
quality
both
are
free
from
mawkishness
and
are
of
the
greater
chopin
the
chopin
of
the
mode
masculine
niecks
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
in
playing
these
nocturnes
op
there
occurred
to
me
a
remark
of
schumann
when
he
reviewed
some
nocturnes
by
count
wielhorski
he
said
that
the
quick
middle
movements
which
chopin
frequently
introduced
into
his
nocturnes
are
often
weaker
than
his
first
conceptions
meaning
the
first
portions
of
his
nocturnes
now
although
the
middle
part
in
the
present
instances
are
on
the
contrary
slower
movements
yet
the
judgment
holds
good
at
least
with
respect
to
the
first
nocturne
the
middle
part
of
which
has
nothing
to
recommend
it
but
a
full
sonorous
instrumentation
if
i
may
use
this
word
in
speaking
of
one
instrument
the
middle
part
of
the
second
d
flat
molto
piu
lento
however
is
much
finer
in
it
we
meet
again
as
we
did
in
some
other
nocturnes
with
soothing
simple
chord
progressions
when
gutmann
studied
the
c
sharp
minor
nocturne
with
chopin
the
master
told
him
that
the
middle
section
the
molto
piu
lento
in
d
flat
major
should
be
played
as
a
recitative
tyrant
commands
the
first
two
chords
he
said
the
other
asks
for
mercy
of
course
niecks
means
the
f
sharp
minor
not
the
c
sharp
minor
nocturne
op
no
dedicated
with
the
c
minor
to
mlle
duperre
opus
two
nocturnes
in
f
minor
and
e
flat
major
need
not
detain
us
long
the
first
is
familiar
kleczynski
devotes
a
page
or
more
to
its
execution
he
seeks
to
vary
the
return
of
the
chief
subject
with
nuances
as
would
an
artistic
singer
the
couplets
of
a
classic
song
there
are
cries
of
despair
in
it
but
at
last
a
feeling
of
hope
kullak
writes
of
the
last
measures
thank
god
the
goal
is
reached
it
is
the
relief
of
a
major
key
after
prolonged
wanderings
in
the
minor
it
is
a
nice
nocturne
neat
in
its
sorrow
yet
not
the
one
following
has
the
impression
of
an
improvisation
it
has
also
the
merit
of
being
seldom
heard
these
two
nocturnes
are
dedicated
to
mlle
stirling
opus
brings
us
to
a
pair
in
b
major
and
e
major
inscribed
to
madame
de
konneritz
the
first
the
tuberose
nocturne
is
faint
with
a
sick
rich
odor
the
climbing
trellis
of
notes
that
so
unexpectedly
leads
to
the
tonic
is
charming
and
the
chief
tune
has
charm
a
fruity
charm
it
is
highly
ornate
its
harmonies
dense
the
entire
surface
overrun
with
wild
ornamentation
and
a
profusion
of
trills
the
piece
the
third
of
its
sort
in
the
key
of
b
is
not
easy
mertke
gives
the
following
explication
of
the
famous
chain
trills
musical
score
excerpt
although
this
nocturne
is
luxuriant
in
style
it
deserves
warmer
praise
than
is
accorded
it
irregular
as
its
outline
is
its
troubled
lyrism
is
appealing
is
melting
and
the
a
flat
portion
with
its
hesitating
timid
accents
has
great
power
of
attraction
the
e
major
nocturne
has
a
bardic
ring
its
song
is
almost
declamatory
and
not
at
all
sentimental
unless
so
distorted
as
niecks
would
have
us
imagine
the
intermediate
portion
is
wavering
and
passionate
like
the
middle
of
the
f
sharp
major
nocturne
it
shows
no
decrease
in
creative
vigor
or
lyrical
fancy
the
klindworth
version
differs
from
the
original
as
an
examination
of
the
following
examples
will
show
the
upper

chopin
musical
score
excerpt
the
posthumous
nocturne
in
e
minor
composed
in
is
weak
and
uninteresting
moreover
it
contains
some
very
modulations
the
recently
discovered
nocturne
in
c
sharp
minor
is
hardly
a
treasure
trove
it
is
vague
and
reminiscent
the
following
note
was
issued
by
its
london
publishers
ascherberg
the
first
question
suggested
by
the
announcement
of
a
new
posthumous
composition
of
chopin
will
be
what
proof
is
there
of
its
authenticity
to
musicians
and
amateurs
who
can
not
recognize
the
beautiful
nocturne
in
c
sharp
minor
as
indeed
the
work
of
chopin
it
may
in
the
first
place
be
pointed
out
that
the
original
manuscript
of
which
a
facsimile
is
given
on
the
is
in
chopin
handwriting
and
secondly
that
the
composition
which
is
strikingly
characteristic
was
at
once
accepted
as
the
work
of
chopin
by
the
distinguished
composer
and
pianist
balakireff
who
played
it
for
the
first
time
in
public
at
the
chopin
commemoration
concert
held
in
the
autumn
of
at
zelazowa
wola
and
afterward
at
warsaw
this
nocturne
was
addressed
by
chopin
to
his
sister
louise
at
warsaw
in
a
letter
from
paris
and
was
written
soon
after
the
production
of
the
two
lovely
piano
concertos
when
chopin
was
still
a
very
young
man
it
contains
a
quotation
from
his
most
admired
concerto
in
f
minor
and
a
brief
reference
to
the
charming
song
known
as
the
maiden
wish
two
of
his
sister
favorite
melodies
the
manuscript
of
the
nocturne
was
supposed
to
have
been
destroyed
in
the
sacking
of
the
zamojski
palace
at
warsaw
toward
the
end
of
the
insurrection
of
but
it
was
discovered
quite
recently
among
papers
of
various
kinds
in
the
possession
of
a
polish
gentleman
a
great
collector
whose
son
offered
polinski
the
privilege
of
selecting
from
such
papers
his
choice
was
three
manuscripts
of
chopin
one
of
them
being
this
nocturne
a
letter
from
polinski
on
the
subject
of
this
nocturne
is
in
the
possession
of
miss
janotha
is
this
the
nocturne
of
which
tausig
spoke
to
his
pupil
joseffy
as
belonging
to
the
master
best
period
or
did
he
refer
to
the
one
in
e
minor
the
berceuse
op
published
june
and
dedicated
to
mlle
elise
gavard
is
the
very
sophistication
of
the
art
of
musical
ornamentation
it
is
built
on
a
tonic
and
dominant
bass
the
triad
of
the
tonic
and
the
chord
of
the
dominant
seventh
a
rocking
theme
is
set
over
this
basso
ostinato
and
the
most
enchanting
effects
are
produced
the
rhythm
never
alters
in
the
bass
and
against
this
background
the
monotone
of
a
dark
gray
sky
the
composer
arranges
an
astonishing
variety
of
fireworks
some
florid
some
subdued
but
all
delicate
in
tracery
and
design
modulations
from
pigeon
egg
blue
to
nile
green
most
misty
and
subtle
modulations
dissolve
before
one
eyes
and
for
a
moment
the
sky
is
peppered
with
tiny
stars
in
doubles
each
independently
tinted
within
a
small
segment
of
the
chromatic
bow
chopin
has
imprisoned
new
strangely
dissonant
colors
it
is
a
miracle
and
after
the
chord
of
the
dominant
seventh
and
the
rain
of
silvery
fire
ceases
one
realizes
that
the
whole
piece
is
a
delicious
illusion
but
an
ululation
in
the

apotheosis

him
a

in

a
babel
of
figuration
on
a
lightly
laid
foundation
but
he
found
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
after
hearing
it
played
by
tausig
confessed
that
the
virtuoso
had
infused
into
the
pages
of
enervating
music
of
one
and
the
same
rhythm
so
much
interest
so
much
motion
so
much
action
that
he
regretted
the
long
piece
was
not
longer
tausig
conception
of
the
barcarolle
was
this
there
are
two
persons
concerned
in
the
affair
it
is
a
love
scene
in
a
discrete
gondola
let
us
say
this
is
the
symbol
of
a
lover
meeting
generally
this
is
expressed
in
thirds
and
sixths
the
dualism
of
two
notes
persons
is
maintained
throughout
all
is
in
this
modulation
in
c
sharp
major
superscribed
dolce
sfogato
there
are
kiss
and
embrace
this
is
evident
when
after
three
bars
of
introduction
the
theme
rocking
in
the
bass
solo
enters
in
the
fourth
this
theme
is
nevertheless
made
use
of
throughout
the
whole
fabric
only
as
an
accompaniment
and
on
this
the
cantilena
in
two
parts
is
laid
we
have
thus
a
continuous
tender
dialogue
the
barcarolle
is
a
nocturne
painted
on
a
large
canvas
with
larger
brushes
it
has
italian
color
in
spots
schumann
said
that
melodically
chopin
sometimes
leans
over
germany
into
italy
and
is
a
masterly
one
in
sentiment
pulsating
with
amorousness
to
me
it
sounds
like
a
lament
for
the
splendors
now
vanished
of
venice
the
queen
in
bars
and
counting
backward
louis
ehlert
finds
obscurities
in
the
middle
voices
it
is
dedicated
to
the
baronne
de
stockhausen
the
nocturnes
including
the
berceuse
and
barcarolle
should
seldom
be
played
in
public
and
not
the
public
of
a
large
hall
something
of
chopin
delicate
tender
warmth
and
spiritual
voice
is
lost
in
larger
spaces
in
a
small
auditorium
and
from
the
fingers
of
a
sympathetic
pianist
the
nocturnes
should
be
heard
that
their
intimate
night
side
may
be
revealed
many
are
like
the
music
en
sourdine
of
paul
verlaine
in
his
chanson
or
le

are
essentially
for
the
twilight
for
solitary
enclosures
where
their
still
mysterious

become
eloquent
and
disclose

x
the
ballades
faery
dramas
hadow
has
said
some
pertinent
things
about
chopin
in
studies
in
modern
music
yet
we
can
not
accept
unconditionally
his
statement
that
in
structure
chopin
is
a
child
playing
with
a
few
simple
types
and
almost
helpless
as
soon
as
he
advances
beyond
them
in
phraseology
he
is
a
master
whose
felicitous
perfection
of
style
is
one
of
the
abiding
treasures
of
the
art
chopin
then
according
to
hadow
is
no
builder
of
the
lofty
rhyme
but
the
poet
of
the
single
line
the
maker
of
the
phrase
exquisite
this
is
hardly
comprehensive
with
the
more
complex
classical
types
of
the
musical
organism
chopin
had
little
sympathy
but
he
contrived
nevertheless
to
write
two
movements
of
a
piano
sonata
that
are
excellent
the
first
half
of
the
b
flat
minor
sonata
the
idealized
dance
forms
he
preferred
the
polonaise
mazurka
and
valse
were
already
there
for
him
to
handle
but
the
ballade
was
not
here
he
is
not
imitator
but
creator
not
but
compact
structures
glowing
with
genius
and
presenting
definite
unity
of
form
and
expression
are
the
ballades
commonly
written
in
and
time
none
of
chopin
compositions
surpasses
in
masterliness
of
form
and
beauty
and
poetry
of
contents
his
ballades
in
them
he
attains
the
acme
of
his
power
as
an
artist
remarks
niecks
i
am
ever
reminded
of
andrew
lang
lines
the
thunder
and
surge
of
the
odyssey
when
listening
to
the
g
minor
ballade
op
it
is
the
odyssey
of
chopin
soul
that
largo
with
its
noiseless
suspension
stays
us
for
a
moment
in
the
courtyard
of
chopin
house
beautiful
then
told
in
his
most
dreamy
tones
the
legend
begins
as
in
some
fabulous
tales
of
the
genii
this
ballade
discloses
surprising
and
delicious
things
there
is
the
tall
lily
in
the
fountain
that
nods
to
the
sun
it
drips
in
cadenced
monotone
and
its
song
is
repeated
on
the
lips
of
the
girl
with
the
eyes
of
midnight
and
so
might
i
weave
for
you
a
story
of
what
i
see
in
the
ballade
and
you
would
be
aghast
or
puzzled
with
such
a
composition
any
programme
could
be
sworn
to
even
the
silly
story
of
the
englishman
who
haunted
chopin
beseeching
him
to
teach
him
this
ballade
that
chopin
had
a
programme
a
definite
one
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
he
has
wise
artist
left
us
no
clue
beyond
mickiewicz
the
polish
bard
lithuanian
poems
in
leipzig
karasowski
relates
that
when
schumann
met
chopin
the
pianist
confessed
having
been
incited
to
the
creation
of
the
ballades
by
the
poetry
of
his
fellow
countryman
the
true
narrative
tone
is
in
this
symmetrically
constructed
ballade
the
most
spirited
most
daring
work
of
chopin
according
to
schumann
louis
ehlert
says
of
the
four
ballades
each
one
differs
entirely
from
the
others
and
they
have
but
one
thing
in
common
their
romantic
working
out
and
the
nobility
of
their
motives
chopin
relates
in
them
not
like
one
who
communicates
something
really
experienced
it
is
as
though
he
told
what
never
took
place
but
what
has
sprung
up
in
his
inmost
soul
the
anticipation
of
something
longed
for
they
may
contain
a
strong
element
of
national
woe
much
outwardly
expressed
and
inwardly
burning
rage
over
the
sufferings
of
his
native
land
yet
they
do
not
carry
with
a
positive
reality
like
that
which
in
a
beethoven
sonata
will
often
call
words
to
our
lips
which
means
that
chopin
was
not
such
a
realist
as
beethoven
ehlert
is
one
of
the
few
sympathetic
german
chopin
commentators
yet
he
did
not
always
indicate
the
salient
outlines
of
his
art
only
the
slav
may
hope
to
understand
chopin
thoroughly
but
these
ballades
are
more
truly
touched
by
the
universal
than
any
other
of
his
works
they
belong
as
much
to
the
world
as
to
poland
the
g
minor
ballade
after
konrad
wallenrod
is
a
logical
well
knit
and
largely
planned
composition
the
closest
parallelism
may
be
detected
in
its
composition
of
themes
its
second
theme
in
e
flat
is
lovely
in
line
color
and
sentiment
the
return
of
the
first
theme
in
a
minor
and
the
quick
answer
in
e
of
the
second
are
evidences
of
feeling
for
organic
unity
development
as
in
strict
cyclic
forms
there
is
not
a
little
after
the
cadenza
built
on
a
figure
of
wavering
tonality
a
theme
emerges
and
enjoys
a
capricious
butterfly
existence
it
is
fascinating
passage
work
of
an
etherealized
character
leads
to
the
second
subject
now
augmented
and
treated
with
a
broad
brush
the
first
questioning
theme
is
heard
again
and
with
a
perpendicular
roar
the
presto
comes
upon
us
for
two
pages
the
dynamic
energy
displayed
by
the
composer
is
almost
appalling
a
whirlwind
i
have
called
it
elsewhere
it
is
a
storm
of
the
emotions
muscular
in
its
virility
i
remember
de
pachmann
a
close
interpreter
of
certain
sides
of
chopin
playing
this
coda
piano
pianissimo
and
prestissimo
the
effect
was
strangely
irritating
to
the
nerves
and
reminded
me
of
a
tornado
seen
from
the
wrong
end
of
an
opera
glass
according
to
his
own
lights
the
russian
virtuoso
was
right
his
strength
was
not
equal
to
the
task
and
so
imitating
chopin
he
the
shading
it
recalled
moscheles
description
of
chopin
playing
his
piano
is
so
softly
breathed
forth
that
he
does
not
require
any
strong
forte
to
produce
the
wished
for
contrast
this
g
minor
ballade
was
published
in
june
and
is
dedicated
to
baron
stockhausen
the
last
bar
of
the
introduction
has
caused
some
controversy

internal

even

who
personally
prefers

thinks
chopin
intended

and
quotes
a
similar

bars
later
he
might
have
added
that
the
entire
composition
contains
examples
look
at
the
first
bar
of
the
valse
episode
in
the
bass
as
niecks
thinks
this
dissonant
e
flat
may
be
said
to
be
the
emotional
keynote
of
the
whole
poem
it
is
a
questioning
thought
that
like
a
sudden
pain
shoots
through
mind
and
body
there
is
other
and
more
confirmatory
evidence
ferdinand

the

is
very
striking
full
of
the
splendors
of
glancing
scales
and
shrill
octave
progressions
it
would
inspire
a
poet
to
write
words
to
it
said
robert
schumann
perhaps
the
most
touching
of
all
that
chopin
has
written
is
the
tale
of
the
f
major
ballade
i
have
witnessed
children
lay
aside
their
games
to
listen
thereto
it
appears
like
some
fairy
tale
that
has
become
music
the
part
has
such
a
clearness
withal
it
seems
as
if
warm
spring
breezes
were
waving
the
lithe
leaves
of
the
palm
tree
how
soft
and
sweet
a
breath
steals
over
the
senses
and
the
heart
and
how
difficult
it
seems
to
be
to
write
of
chopin
except
in
terms
of
impassioned
prose
louis
ehlert
a
romantic
in
feeling
and
a
classicist
in
theory
is
the
writer
of
the
foregoing
the
second
ballade
although
dedicated
to
robert
schumann
did
not
excite
his
warmest
praise
a
less
artistic
work
than
the
first
he
wrote
but
equally
fantastic
and
intellectual
its
impassioned
episodes
seem
to
have
been
afterward
inserted
i
recollect
very
well
that
when
chopin
played
this
ballade
for
me
it
finished
in
f
major
it
now
closes
in
a
minor
willeby
gives
its
key
as
f
minor
it
is
really
in
the
keys
of
f
major
a
minor
chopin
psychology
was
seldom
at
fault
a
major
ending
would
have
crushed
this
extraordinary
written
chopin
admits
under
the
direct
inspiration
of
adam
mickiewicz
le
lac
de
willis
willeby
accepts
schumann
dictum
of
the
inferiority
of
this
ballade
to
its
predecessor
niecks
does
not
niecks
is
quite
justified
in
asking
how
two
such
wholly
dissimilar
things
can
be
compared
and
weighed
in
this
fashion
in
truth
they
can
not
the
second
ballade
possesses
beauties
in
no
way
inferior
to
those
of
the
first
he
continues
what
can
be
finer
than
the
simple
strains
of
the
opening
section
they
sound
as
if
they
had
been
drawn
from
the
people
of
song
the
entrance
of
the
presto
surprises
and
seems
out
of
keeping
with
what
precedes
but
what
we
hear
after
the
return
of
tempo
primo
the
development
of
those
simple
strains
or
rather
the
cogitations
on
them
justifies
the
presence
of
the
presto
the
second
appearance
of
the
latter
leads
to
an
urging
restless
coda
in
a
minor
which
closes
in
the
same
key
and
pianissimo
with
a
few
bars
of
the
simple
serene
now
veiled
first
strain
rubinstein
bore
great
love
for
this
second
ballade
this
is
what
it
meant
for
him
is
it
possible
that
the
interpreter
does
not
feel
the
necessity
of
representing
to
his
audience
a
field
flower
caught
by
a
gust
of
wind
a
caressing
of
the
flower
by
the
wind
the
resistance
of
the
flower
the
stormy
struggle
of
the
wind
the
entreaty
of
the
flower
which
at
last
lies
there
broken
and
paraphrased
the
field
flower
a
rustic
maiden
the
wind
a
knight
i
can
find
no
lack
of
affinity
between
the
andantino
and
presto
the
surprise
is
a
dramatic
one
withal
rudely
vigorous
chopin
robust
treatment
of
the
first
theme
results
in
a
strong
piece
of
craftmanship
the
episodical
nature
of
this
ballade
is
the
fruit
of
the
esoteric
moods
of
its
composer
it
follows
a
hidden
story
and
has
the
quality
as
the
second
impromptu
in
f
sharp
of
great
unpremeditated
art
it
shocks
one
by
its
abrupt
but
by
no
means
fantastic
transitions
the
key
color
is
changeful
and
the
fluctuating
themes
are
well
contrasted
it
was
written
at
majorca
while
the
composer
was
only
too
noticeably
disturbed
in
body
and
soul
presto

for

also
wisely

i
wish
the

were
played
oftener
in
public
it
is
quite
neglected
for
the

in
a

which
as
ehlert
says
has
the
voice
of
the
people
this
ballade
the
undine
of
mickiewicz
published
november
and
dedicated
to
mlle
de
noailles
is
too
well
known
to
analyze
it
is
the
schoolgirls
delight
who
familiarly
toy
with
its
demon
seeing
only
favor
and
prettiness
in
its
elegant
measures
in
it
the
refined
gifted
pole
who
is
accustomed
to
move
in
the
most
distinguished
circles
of
the
french
capital
is
to
be
recognized
thus
schumann
forsooth
it
is
aristocratic
gay
graceful
piquant
and
also
something
more
even
in
its
playful
moments
there
is
delicate
irony
a
spiritual
sporting
with
graver
and
more
passionate
emotions
those
broken
octaves
which
usher
in
each
time
the
second
theme
with
its
fascinating
infectious
rhythmical
lilt
what
an
ironically
joyous
fillip
they
give
the
imagination
a
coquettish
grace
if
we
accept
by
this
expression
that
half
unconscious
toying
with
the
power
that
charms
and
fires
that
follows
up
confession
with
reluctance
seems
the
very
essence
of
being
it
becomes
a
difficult
task
to
transcribe
the
easy
transitions
full
of
an
irresistible
charm
with
which
he
portrays
love
game
who
will
not
recall
the
memorable
passage
in
the
a
flat
ballade
where
the
right
hand
alone
takes
up
the
dotted
eighths
after
the
sustained
chord
of
the
sixth
of
a
flat
could
a
lover
confusion
be
more
deliciously
enhanced
by
silence
and
hesitation
ehlert
above
evidently
sees
a
ballroom
picture
of
brilliancy
with
the
regulation
tender
avowal
the
episodes
of
this
ballade
are
so
attenuated
of
any
grosser
elements
that
none
but
psychical
meanings
should
be
read
into
them
the
disputed
passage
is
on
the
fifth
page
of
the
kullak
edition
after
the
trills
a
measure
is
missing
in
kullak
who
like
klindworth
gives
it
in
a
footnote
to
my
mind
this
repetition
adds
emphasis
although
it
is
a
formal
blur
and
what
an
irresistible
moment
it
is
this
delightful
territory
before
the
darker
mood
of
the
c
sharp
minor
part
is
reached
niecks
becomes
enthusiastic
over
the
insinuation
and
persuasion
of
this
composition
the
composer
showing
himself
in
a
fundamentally
caressing
mood
the
ease
with
which
the
entire
work
is
floated
proves
that
chopin
in
mental
health
was
not
daunted
by
larger
forms
there
is
moonlight
in
this
music
and
some
sunlight
too
the
prevailing
moods

coquetry

a

quotation
is
about
this
piece
tausig
impressed
me
deeply
in
his
interpretation
of
ballade
in
f
minor
it
has
three
requirements
the
comprehension
of
the
programme
as
a
whole
for
chopin
writes
according
to
a
programme
to
the
situations
in
life
best
known
to
and
understood
by
himself
and
in
an
adequate
manner
the
conquest
of
the
stupendous
difficulties
in
complicated
figures
winding
harmonies
and
formidable
passages
tausig
fulfilled
these
requirements
presenting
an
embodiment
of
the
signification
and
the
feeling
of
the
work
the
ballade
andante

begins
in
the
major
key
of

seventh

to
a
stand
before

on

the
easy
handling
of
these
seven
measures
tausig
interpreted
thus
piece
has
not
yet
begun
in
his
firmer
nobly
expressive
exposition
of
the
principal
theme
free
from
sentimentality
to
which
one
might
easily
yield
the
grand
style
found
due
scope
an
essential
requirement
in
an
instrumental
virtuoso
is
that
he
should
understand
how
to
breathe
and
how
to
allow
his
hearers
to
take
breath
giving
them
opportunity
to
arrive
at
a
better
understanding
by
this
i
mean
a
well
chosen
incision
the
cesura
and
a
lingering
letting
in
air
tausig
cleverly
called
it
which
in
no
way
impairs
rhythm
and
time
but
rather
brings
them
into
stronger
relief
a
lingering
which
our
signs
of
notation
can
not
adequately
express
because
it
is
made
up
of
atomic
time
values
rub
the
bloom
from
a
peach
or
from
a
butterfly
what
remains
will
belong
to
the
kitchen
to
natural
history
it
is
not
otherwise
with
chopin
the
bloom
consisted
in
treatment
of
the
ballade
he
came
to
the
first
passage
the
motive
among
blossoms
and
leaves
a
figurated
recurrence
to
the
principal
theme
is
in
the
inner
parts
its
polyphonic
variant
a
little
thread
connects
this
with
the
introduction
of
the
second
theme
the
theme
is
strongly
and
abruptly
modulated
perhaps
a
little
too
much
so
tausig
tied
the
little
thread
to
a
doppio
movimento
in
time
but
thereby
resulted
sextolets
which
threw
the
chorale
into
still
bolder
relief
then
followed
a
passage
a
tempo
in
which
the
principal
theme
played
hide
and
seek
how
clear
it
all
became
as
tausig
played
it
of
technical
difficulties
he
knew
literally
nothing
the
intricate
and
evasive
parts
were
as
easy
as
the
easiest
i
might
say
easier
i
admired
the
short
trills
in
the
left
hand
which
were
trilled
out
quite
independently
as
if
by
a
second
player
the
gliding
ease
of
the
cadence
marked
dolcissimo
it
swung
itself
into
the
higher
register
where
it
came
to
a
stop
before
a
major
just
as
the
introduction
stopped
before

then
after
the
theme
has
once
more
presented
itself
in
a
modified
form
variant
it
comes
under
the
pestle
of
an
extremely
figurate
coda
which
demands
the
study
of
an
artist
the
strength
of
a
robust
man
the
most
vigorous
pianistic
health
in
a
word
tausig
overcame
this
threatening
group
of
terrific
difficulties
whose
appearance
in
the
piece
is
well
explained
by
the
programme
without
the
slightest
effect
the
coda
in
modulated
harp
tones
came
to
a
stop
before
a
fermata
which
corresponded
to
those
before
mentioned
in
order
to
cast
anchor
in
the
haven
of
the

finishing
with
a
dance
of
triplets
doubled
in
thirds
this
piece
winds
up
with
extreme
bravura
the
lingering
mentioned
by
de
lenz
is
tempo
rubato
so
fatally
misunderstood
by
most
chopin
players
de
lenz
in
a
note
quotes
meyerbeer
as
saying
meyerbeer
who
quarrelled
with
chopin
about
the
rhythm
of
a
mazurka
can
one
reduce
women
to
notation
they
would
breed
mischief
were
they
emancipated
from
the
measure
there
is
passion
refined
and
swelling
in
the
curves
of
this
most
eloquent
composition
it
is
chopin
at
the
supreme
summit
of
his
art
an
art
alembicated
personal
and
intoxicating
i
know
of
nothing
in
music
like
the
f
minor
ballade
bach
in
the
chromatic
fantasia
be
not
deceived
by
its
classical
contours
it
is
music
hot
from
the
soul
beethoven
in
the
first
movement
of
the
c
sharp
minor
sonata
the
arioso
of
the
sonata
op
and
possibly
schumann
in
the
opening
of
his
c
major
fantaisie
are
as
intimate
as
personal
as
the
f
minor
ballade
which
is
as
subtly
distinctive
as
the
hands
and
smile
of
lisa
gioconda
its
inaccessible
position
preserves
it
from
rude
and
irreverent
treatment
its
witchery
is
irresistible
xi

guy
de
maupassant
put
before
us
a
widely
diverse
number
of
novels
in
a
famous
essay
attached
to
the
definitive
edition
of
his
masterpiece
pierre
et
jean
and
puzzlingly
demanded
the
real
form
of
the
novel
if
don
quixote
is
one
how
can
madame
bovary
be
another
if
les
miserables
is
included
in
the
list
what
are
we
to
say
to
la
bas
just
such
a
question
i
should
like
to
propound
substituting
sonata
for
novel
if
scarlatti
wrote
sonatas
what
is
the
appassionata
if
the
a
flat
weber
is
one
can
the
f
minor
brahms
be
called
a
sonata
is
the
haydn
form
orthodox
and
the
schumann
heterodox
these
be
enigmas
to
make
weary
the
formalists
come
let
us
confess
and
in
the
open
air
there
is
a
great
amount
of
hypocrisy
and
cant
in
this
matter
we
can
as
can
any
conservatory
student
give
the
recipe
for
turning
out
a
smug
specimen
of
the
form
but
when
we
study
the
great
examples
it
is
just
the
subtle
eluding
of
hard
and
fast
rules
that
distinguishes
the
efforts
of
the
masters
from
the
machine
work
of
apprentices
and
academic
monsters
because
it
is
no
servile
copy
of
the
mozart
sonata
the
f
sharp
minor
of
brahms
is
a
piece
of
original
art
beethoven
at
first
trod
in
the
well
blazed
path
of
haydn
but
study
his
second
period
and
it
sounds
the
big
beethoven
note
there
is
no
final
court
of
appeal
in
the
matter
of
musical
form
and
there
is
none
in
the
matter
of
literary
style
the
history
of
the
sonata
is
the
history
of
musical
evolution
every
great
composer
schubert
included
added
to
the
form
filed
here
chipped
away
there
introduced
lawlessness
where
reigned
prim
order
witness
the
schumann
f
sharp
minor
sonata
and
then
came
chopin
the
chopin
sonata
has
caused
almost
as
much
warfare
as
the
wagner
music
drama
it
is
all
the
more
ludicrous
for
chopin
never
wrote
but
one
piano
sonata
that
has
a
classical
complexion
in
c
minor
op
and
it
was
composed
as
early
as
not
published
until
july
it
demonstrates
without
a
possibility
of
doubt
that
the
composer
had
no
sympathy
with
the
form
he
tried
so
hard
and
failed
so
dismally
that
it
is
a
relief
when
the
second
and
third
sonatas
are
reached
for
in
them
there
are
only
traces
of
formal
beauty
and
organic
unity
but
then
there
is
much
chopin
while
little
of
his
precious
essence
is
to
be
tasted
in
the
first
sonata
chopin
wrote
of
the
c
minor
sonata
as
a
pupil
i
dedicated
it
to
elsner
and
oh
the
irony
of
criticism
it
was
praised
by
the
critics
because
not
so
revolutionary
as
the
variations
op
this
too
despite
the
larghetto
in
time
the
first
movement
is
wheezing
and
all
but
lifeless
one
asks
in
astonishment
what
chopin
is
doing
in
this
gallery
and
it
is
technically
difficult
the
menuetto
is
excellent
its
trio
being
a
faint
approach
to
beethoven
in
color
the
unaccustomed
rhythm
of
the
slow
movement
is
irritating
our
young
chopin
does
not
move
about
as
freely
as
benjamin
godard
in
the
scherzo
of
his
violin
and
piano
sonata
in
the
same
bizarre
rhythm
niecks
sees
naught
but
barren
waste
in
the
finale
i
disagree
with
him
there
is
the
breath
of
a
stirring
spirit
an
imitative
attempt
that
is
more
diverting
than
the
other
movements
above
all
there
is
movement
and
the
close
is
vigorous
though
banal
the
sonata
is
the
dullest
music
penned
by
chopin
but
as
a
whole
it
hangs
together
as
a
sonata
better
than
its
two
successors
so
much
for
an
attempt
at
strict
devotion
to
scholastic
form
from
this
schoolroom
we
are
transported
in
op
to
the
theatre
of
larger
life
and
passion
the
b
flat
minor
sonata
was
published
may
two
movements
are
masterpieces
the
funeral
march
that
forms
the
third
movement
is
one
of
the
pole
most
popular
compositions
while
the
finale
has
no
parallel
in
piano
music
schumann
says
that
chopin
here
bound
together
four
of
his
maddest
children
and
he
is
not
astray
he
thinks
the
march
does
not
belong
to
the
work
it
certainly
was
written
before
its
companion
movements
as
much
as
hadow
admires
the
first
two
movements
he
groans
at
the
last
pair
though
they
are
admirable
when
considered
separately
these
four
movements
have
no
common
life
chopin
says
he
intended
the
strange
finale
as
a
gossiping
commentary
on
the
march
the
left
hand
unisono
with
the
right
hand
are
gossiping
after
the
march
perhaps
the
last
two
movements
do
hold
together
but
what
have
they
in
common
with
the
first
two
tonality
proves
nothing
notwithstanding
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
the
grave
the
power
and
passion
of
the
scherzo
this
sonata
in
b
flat
minor
is
not
more
a
sonata
than
it
is
a
sequence
of
ballades
and
scherzi
and
again
we
are
at
the
de
maupassant
crux
the
work
never
could
be
spared
it
is
chopin
mounted
for
action
and
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
the
doppio
movimento
is
a
strong
curt
and
characteristic
theme
for
treatment
here
is
power
and
in
the
expanding
prologue
flashes
more
than
a
hint
of
the
tragic
the
d
flat
melody
is
soothing
charged
with
magnetism
and
urged
to
a
splendid
fever
of
climax
the
working
out
section
is
too
short
and
dissonantal
but
there
is
development
perhaps
more
technical
than
logical
i
mean
by
this
more
pianistic
than
intellectually
musical
and
we
mount
with
the
composer
until
the
b
flat
version
of
the
second
subject
is
reached
for
the
first
subject
strange
to
say
does
not
return
from
that
on
to
the
firm
chords
of
the
close
there
is
no
misstep
no
faltering
or
obscurity
noble
pages
have
been
read
and
the
scherzo
is
approached
with
eagerness
again
there
is
no
disappointment
on
numerous
occasions
i
have
testified
my
regard
for
this
movement
in
warm
and
uncritical
terms
it
is
simply
unapproachable
and
has
no
equal
for
lucidity
brevity
and
polish
among
the
works
of
chopin
except
the
scherzo
in
c
sharp
minor
but
there
is
less
irony
more
muscularity
and
more
native
sweetness
in
this
e
flat
minor
scherzo
i
like
the
way
kullak
marks
the
first
b
flat
octave
it
is
a
pregnant
beginning
the
second
bar
i
have
never
heard
from
any
pianist
save
rubinstein
given
with
the
proper
crescendo
no
one
else
seems
to
get
it
explosive
enough
within
the
walls
of
one
bar
it
is
a
true
crescendo
and
in
what
a
wild
country
we
are
landed
when
the
f
sharp
minor
is
crashed
out
stormy
chromatic
double
notes
chords
of
the
sixth
rush
on
with
incredible
fury
and
the
scherzo
ends
on
the
very
apex
of
passion
a
trio
in
g
flat
is
the
song
of
songs
its
swaying
rhythms
and
investing
a
melody
at
once
sensuous
and
chaste
the
second
part
and
the
return
to
the
scherzo
are
proofs
of
the
composer
sense
of
balance
and
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
of
anticipation
the
closest
parallelisms
are
noticeable
the
technique
so
admirable
that
the
scherzo
floats
in
flaubert
ideal
of
a
miraculous
style
and
then
follows
that
deadly
marche
funebre
ernest
newman
in
his
remarkable
study
of
wagner
speaks
of
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
orders
of
imagination
as
exemplified
by
beethoven
and
chopin
on
the
one
side
wagner
on
the
other
this
regarding
the
funeral
marches
of
the
three
newman
finds
wagner
the
more
concrete
imagination
the
inward
picture
of
beethoven
and
chopin
much
vaguer
and
more
diffused
yet
chopin
is
seldom
so
realistic
here
are
the
basses
the
morbid
coloring
schumann
found
it
contained
much
that
is
repulsive
and
liszt
raves
rhapsodically
over
it
for
karasowski
it
was
the
pain
and
grief
of
an
entire
nation
while
ehlert
thinks
it
owes
its
renown
to
the
wonderful
effect
of
two
triads
which
in
their
combination
possess
a
highly
tragical
element
the
middle
movement
is
not
at
all
characteristic
why
could
it
not
at
least
have
worn
second
mourning
after
so
much
black
crepe
drapery
one
should
not
at
least
at
once
display
white
lingerie
this
is
cruel
the
d
flat
trio
is
a
logical
relief
after
the
booming
and
glooming
of
the
opening
that
it
is
a
rapturous
gaze
into
the
beatific
regions
of
a
beyond
as
niecks
writes
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
we
do
know
however
that
the
march
when
isolated
has
a
much
more
profound
effect
than
in
its
normal
sequence
the
presto
is
too
wonderful
for
words
rubinstein
or
was
it
originally
tausig
who
named
it
night
winds
sweeping
over
the
churchyard
graves
its
agitated
whirring
unharmonized
triplets
are
strangely
disquieting
and
can
never
be
mistaken
for
mere
etude
passage
work
the
movement
is
too
sombre
its
curves
too
full
of
meanings
its
rush
and
growling
too
expressive
of
something
that
defies
definition
schumann
compares
it
to
a
sphinx
with
a
mocking
smile
to
henri
barbadette
lazare
grattant
de
ses
ongles
la
pierre
de
son
tombeau
or
like
mendelssohn
one
may
abhor
it
yet
it
can
not
be
ignored
it
has
asiatic
coloring
and
to
me
seems
like
the
wavering
outlines
of
hills
seen
sharply
en
silhouette
behind
which
rises
and
falls
a
faint
infernal
glow
this
art
paints
as
many
differing
pictures
as
there
are
imaginations
for
its
sonorous
background
not
alone
the
universal
solvent
as
henry
james
thinks
it
bridges
the
vast
silent
gulfs
between
human
souls
with
its
humming
eloquence
this
sonata
is
not
dedicated
the
third
sonata
in
b
minor
op
has
more
of
that
undefinable
organic
unity
yet
withal
it
is
not
so
powerful
so
or
so
compact
of
thematic
interest
as
its
forerunner
the
first
page
to
the
chromatic
chords
of
the
sixth
promises
much
there
is
a
clear
statement
a
sound
theme
for
developing
purposes
the
crisp
march
of
chord
progressions
and
then
the
edifice
goes
up
in
smoke
after
wreathings
and
curlings
of
passage
work
and
on
the
rim
of
despair
we
witness
the
exquisite
budding
of
the
melody
in
it
is
an
aubade
a
nocturne
of
the
morn
if
the
contradictory
phrase
be
allowed
there
is
morning
freshness
in
its
hue
and
scent
and
when
it
bursts
a
parterre
of
roses
the
close
of
the
section
is
inimitable
all
the
more
sorrow
at
what
follows
wild
disorder
and
the
luxuriance
called
tropical
when
b
major
is
compassed
we
sigh
for
it
augurs
us
a
return
of
delight
the
ending
is
not
that
of
a
sonata
but
a
love
lyric
for
chopin
is
not
the
cool
breadth
and
marmoreal
majesty
of
blank
verse
he
sonnets
to
perfection
but
the
epical
air
does
not
fill
his
nostrils
vivacious
charming
light
as
a
harebell
in
the
soft
breeze
is
the
scherzo
in
e
flat
it
has
a
clear
ring
of
the
scherzo
and
harks
back
to
weber
in
its
impersonal
amiable
hurry
the
largo
is
tranquilly
beautiful
rich
in
its
reverie
lovely
in
its
tune
the
trio
is
reserved
and
hypnotic
the
last
movement
with
its
brilliancy
and
force
is
a
favorite
but
it
lacks
weight
and
the
entire
sonata
is
as
niecks
writes
affiliated
but
not
cognate
it
was
published
june
and
is
dedicated
to
comtesse
de
perthuis
so
these
sonatas
of
chopin
are
not
sonatas
at
all
but
throwing
titles
to
the
dogs
would
we
forego
the
sensations
that
two
of
them
evoke
there
is
still
another
the
sonata
in
g
minor
op
for
piano
and
it
is
dedicated
to
chopin
friend
august
franchomme
the
violoncellist
now
while
i
by
no
means
share
finck
exalted
impression
of
this
work
yet
i
fancy
the
critics
have
dealt
too
harshly
with
it
robbed
of
its
title
of
sonata
though
sedulously
aping
this
form
it
contains
much
pretty
music
and
it
is
grateful
for
the
there
is
not
an
abundant
literature
for
this
kingly
instrument
in
conjunction
with
the
piano
so
why
flaunt
chopin
contribution
i
will
admit
that
he
walks
stiffly
encased
in
his
borrowed
garb
but
there
is
the
andante
short
as
it
is
an
effective
scherzo
and
a
carefully
made
allegro
and
finale
tonal
monotony
is
the
worst
charge
to
be
brought
against
this
work
the
trio
also
in
g
minor
op
is
more
alluring
it
was
published
march
and
dedicated
to
prince
anton
radziwill
chopin
later
in
speaking
of
it
to
a
pupil
admitted
that
he
saw
things
he
would
like
to
change
he
regretted
not
making
it
for
viola
instead
of
violin
and
piano
it
was
worked
over
a
long
time
the
first
movement
being
ready
in
when
it
appeared
it
won
philistine
praise
for
its
form
more
nearly
approximates
the
sonata
than
any
of
his
efforts
in
the
cyclical
order
excepting
op
in
it
the
piano
receives
better
treatment
than
the
other
instruments
there
are
many
virtuoso
passages
but
again
key
changes
are
not
frequent
or
disparate
enough
to
avoid
a
monotone
chopin
imagination
refuses
to
become
excited
when
working
in
the
open
spaces
of
the
sonata
form
like
creatures
that
remain
drab
of
hue
in
unsympathetic
or
dangerous
environment
his
music
is
transformed
to
a
bewildering
bouquet
of
color
when
he
breathes
native
air
compare
the
wildly
modulating
chopin
of
the
ballades
to
the
chopin
of
the
sonatas
trio
and
concertos
the
trio
opens
with
fire
the
scherzo
is
fanciful
and
the
adagio
charming
while
the
finale
is
cheerful
to
loveliness
it
might
figure
occasionally
on
the
programmes
of
our
chamber
music
concerts
despite
its
youthful
puerility
there
remain
the
two
concertos
which
i
do
not
intend
discussing
fully
not
chopin
at
his
very
best
the
e
minor
and
f
minor
concertos
are
frequently
heard
because
of
the
chances
afforded
the
solo
player
i
have
written
elsewhere
at
length
of
the
klindworth
tausig
and
burmeister
versions
of
the
two
concertos
as
time
passes
i
see
no
reason
for
amending
my
views
on
this
troublous
subject
edgar
kelly
holds
a
potent
brief
for
the
original
orchestration
contending
that
it
suits
the
character
of
the
piano
part
rosenthal
puts
this
belief
into
practice
by
playing
the
older
version
of
the
e
minor
with
the
first
long
tutti
curtailed
but
he
is
not
consistent
for
he
uses
the
tausig
octaves
at
the
close
of
the
rondo
while
i
admire
the
tausig
orchestration
these
particlar
octaves
are
hideously
cacaphonic
the
original
triplet
unisons
are
so
much
more
graceful
and
musical
the
chronology
of
the
concertos
has
given
rise
to
controversy
the
trouble
arose
from
the
f
minor
concerto
it
being
numbered
op
although
composed
before
the
one
in
e
minor
the
former
was
published
april
the
latter
september
the
slow
movement
of
the
f
minor
concerto
was
composed
by
chopin
during
his
passion
for
constantia
gladowska
she
was
the
ideal
he
mentions
in
his
letters
the
adagio
of
this
concerto
this
larghetto
in
a
flat
is
a
trifle
too
ornamental
for
my
taste
mellifluous
and
serene
as
it
is
the
recitative
is
finely
outlined
i
think
i
like
best
the
romanze
of
the
e
minor
concerto
it
is
less
flowery
the
c
sharp
minor
part
is
imperious
in
its
beauty
while
the
murmuring
mystery
of
the
close
mounts
to
the
imagination
the
rondo
is
frolicksome
tricky
genial
and
genuine
piano
music
it
is
true
the
first
movement
is
too
long
too
much
in
one
set
of
keys
and
the
section
too
much
in
the
nature
of
a
technical
study
the
first
movement
of
the
f
minor
far
transcends
it
in
breadth
passion
and
musical
feeling
but
it
is
short
and
there
is
no
coda
richard
burmeister
has
supplied
the
latter
deficiency
in
a
capitally
made
cadenza
which
paderewski
plays
it
is
a
complete
summing
up
of
the
movement
the
finale
is
very
graceful
and
full
of
pure
sweet
melody
this
concerto
is
altogether
more
human
than
the
e
minor
both
derive
from
hummel
and
field
the
passage
work
is
superior
in
design
to
that
of
the
earlier
masters
the
general
character
episodical
but
episodes
of
rare
worth
and
originality
as
ehlert
says
noblesse
oblige
and
thus
chopin
felt
himself
compelled
to
satisfy
all
demands
exacted
of
a
pianist
and
wrote
the
unavoidable
piano
concerto
it
was
not
consistent
with
his
nature
to
express
himself
in
broad
terms
his
lungs
were
too
weak
for
the
pace
in
seven
league
boots
so
often
required
in
a
score
the
trio
and
sonata
were
also
tasks
for
whose
accomplishment
nature
did
not
design
him
he
must
touch
the
keys
by
himself
without
being
called
upon
to
heed
the
players
sitting
next
him
he
is
at
his
best
when
without
formal
restraint
he
can
create
out
of
his
inmost
soul
he
must
touch
the
keys
by
himself
there
you
have
summed
up
in
a
phrase
the
reason
chopin
never
succeeded
in
impressing
his
individuality
upon
the
sonata
form
and
his
playing
upon
the
masses
his
was
the
lonely
soul
george
sand
knew
this
when
she
wrote
he
made
an
instrument
speak
the
language
of
the
infinite
often
in
ten
lines
that
a
child
might
play
he
has
introduced
poems
of
unequalled
elevation
dramas
unrivalled
in
force
and
energy
he
did
not
need
the
great
material
methods
to
find
expression
for
his
genius
neither
saxophone
nor
ophicleide
was
necessary
for
him
to
fill
the
soul
with
awe
without
church
organ
or
human
voice
he
inspired
faith
and
enthusiasm
it
might
be
remarked
here
that
beethoven
too
aroused
a
wondering
and
worshipping
world
without
the
aid
of
saxophone
or
ophicleide
but
it
is
needless
cruelty
to
pick
at
madame
sand
criticisms
she
had
no
technical
education
and
so
little
appreciation
of
chopin
peculiar
genius
for
the
piano
that
she
could
write
the
day
will
come
when
his
music
will
be
arranged
for
orchestra
without
change
of
the
piano
score
which
is
nonsense
we
have
sounded
weakness
when
writing
for
any
instrument
but
his
own
when
writing
in
any
form
but
his
own
the
e
minor
concerto
is
dedicated
to
frederick
kalkbrenner
the
f
minor
to
the
comtesse
deiphine
potocka
the
latter
dedication
demonstrates
that
he
could
forget
his
only
ideal
in
the
presence
of
the
charming
potocka
ah
these
vibratile
and
versatile
poles
robert
schumann
it
is
related
shook
his
head
wearily
when
his
early
work
was
mentioned
dreary
stuff
said
the
composer
whose
critical
sense
did
not
fail
him
even
in
so
personal
a
question
what
chopin
thought
of
his
youthful
music
may
be
discovered
in
his
scanty
correspondence
to
suppose
that
the
young
chopin
sprang
into
the
arena
a
fully
equipped
warrior
is
one
of
those
nonsensical
notions
which
gains
currency
among
persons
unfamiliar
with
the
law
of
musical
evolution
chopin
musical
ancestry
is
easily
traced
as
poe
had
his
holley
chivers
chopin
had
his
field
the
germs
of
his
second
period
are
all
there
from
op
to
opus
virtuosity
for
virtuosity
sake
is
very
evident
liszt
has
said
that
in
every
young
artist
there
is
the
virtuoso
fever
and
chopin
being
a
pianist
did
not
escape
the
fever
of
the
footlights
he
was
composing
too
at
a
time
when
piano
music
was
well
nigh
strangled
by
excess
of
ornament
when
acrobats
were
kings
when
the
bach
fugue
and
beethoven
sonata
lurked
neglected
and
dusty
in
the
memories
of
the
few
little
wonder
then
we
find
this
individual
youthful
pole
not
timidly
treading
in
the
path
of
popular
composition
but
bravely
carrying
his
banner
spangled
glittering
and
fanciful
and
outstripping
at
their
own
game
all
the
virtuosi
of
europe
his
originality
in
this
bejewelled
work
caused
hummel
to
admire
and
kalkbrenner
to
wonder
the
supple
fingers
of
the
young
man
from
warsaw
made
quick
work
of
existing
technical
difficulties
he
needs
must
invent
some
of
his
own
and
when
schumann
saw
the
pages
of
op
he
uttered
his
historical
cry
today
we
wonder
somewhat
at
his
enthusiasm
it
is
the
old
story
a
generation
seeks
to
know
a
generation
comprehends
and
enjoys
and
a
generation
discards
opus
a
rondo
in
c
minor
dedicated
to
madame
de
linde
saw
the
light
in
but
it
was
preceded
by
two
polonaises
a
set
of
variations
and
two
mazurkas
in
g
and
b
flat
major
schumann
declared
that
first
published
work
was
his
tenth
and
that
between
op
and
there
lay
two
years
and
twenty
works
be
this
as
it
may
one
can
not
help
liking
the
c
minor
rondo
in
the
a
flat
section
we
detect
traces
of
his
f
minor
concerto
there
is
lightness
joy
in
creation
which
contrast
with
the
heavy
dour
quality
of
the
c
minor
sonata
op
loosely
constructed
in
a
formal
sense
and
too
exuberant
for
his
strict
confines
this
op
is
remarkable
much
more
remarkable
than
schumann
abegg
variations
the
rondo
a
la
mazur
in
f
is
a
further
advance
it
is
dedicated
to
comtesse
moriolles
and
was
published
in
schumann
reviewed
it
in
it
is
sprightly
polish
in
feeling
and
rhythmic
life
and
a
glance
at
any
of
its
pages
gives
us
the
familiar
chopin
impression
florid
passage
work
chords
in
extensions
and
chromatic
progressions
the
concert
rondo
op
in
f
called
krakowiak
is
built
on
a
national
dance
in
time
which
originated
in
cracovia
it
is
to
quote
niecks
a
modified
polonaise
danced
by
the
peasants
with
lusty
abandon
its
accentual
life
is
usually
manifested
on
an
unaccented
part
of
the
bar
especially
at
the
end
of
a
section
or
phrase
chopin
very
slavic
version
is
spirited
but
the
virtuoso
predominates
there
is
lushness
in
ornamentation
and
a
bold
merry
spirit
informs
every
page
the
orchestral
accompaniment
is
thin
dedicated
to
the
princesse
czartoryska
it
was
published
june
the
rondo
op
with
an
introduction
is
in
great
favor
at
the
conservatories
and
is
neat
rather
than
poetical
although
the
introduction
has
dramatic
touches
it
is
to
this
brilliant
piece
with
its
affinities
that
richard
burmeister
has
supplied
an
orchestral
accompaniment
the
remaining
rondo
posthumously
published
as
op
and
composed
in
was
originally
intended
so
chopin
writes
in
for
one
piano
it
is
full
of
fire
but
the
ornamentation
runs
mad
and
no
traces
of
the
poetical
chopin
are
present
he
is
preoccupied
with
the
brilliant
surfaces
of
the
life
about
him
his
youthful
expansiveness
finds
a
fair
field
in
these
variations
rondos
and
fantasias
schumann
enthusiasm
over
the
variations
on
la
ci
darem
la
mano
seems
to
us
a
little
overdone
chopin
had
not
much
gift
for
variation
in
the
sense
that
we
now
understand
variation
beethoven
schumann
and
brahms
one
must
include
mendelssohn
serious
variations
are
masters
of
a
form
that
is
by
no
means
structurally
simple
or
a
reversion
to
mere
spielerei
as
finck
fancies
chopin
plays
with
his
themes
prettily
but
it
is
all
surface
display
all
heat
lightning
he
never
smites
as
does
brahms
with
his
thor
hammer
the
subject
full
in
the
middle
cleaving
it
to
its
core
chopin
is
slightly
effeminate
in
his
variations
and
they
are
true
specimens
of
spielerei
despite
the
cleverness
of
design
in
the
arabesques
their
brilliancy
and
euphony
op
has
its
dazzling
moments
but
its
musical
worth
is
inferior
it
is
written
to
split
the
ears
of
the
groundlings
or
rather
to
astonish
and
confuse
them
for
the
chopin
dynamics
in
the
early
music
are
never
very
rude
the
indisputable
superiority
to
herz
and
the
rest
of
the
variationists
caused
schumann
passionate
admiration
it
has
however
given
us
an
interesting
page
of
music
criticism
rellstab
grumpy
old
fellow
was
near
right
when
he
wrote
of
these
variations
that
the
composer
runs
down
the
theme
with
roulades
and
throttles
and
hangs
it
with
chains
of
shakes
the
skip
makes
its
appearance
in
the
fourth
variation
and
there
is
no
gainsaying
the
brilliancy
and
piquant
spirit
of
the
alla
polacca
op
is
orchestrally
accompanied
an
accompaniment
that
may
be
gladly
dispensed
with
and
dedicated
by
chopin
to
the
friend
of
his
youth
titus
woyciechowski
je
vends
des
scapulaires
is
a
tune
in
herold
and
halevy
ludovic
chopin
varied
it
in
his
op
this
rondo
in
b
flat
is
the
weakest
of
chopin
muse
it
is
chopin
and
water
and
gallic
eau
sucree
at
that
the
piece
is
written
tastefully
is
not
difficult
but
woefully
artificial
published
in
it
was
dedicated
to
miss
emma
horsford
in
may
appeared
the
variations
in
e
without
an
opus
number
they
are
not
worth
the
trouble
evidently
composed
before
chopin
op
and
before
they
are
musically
light
waisted
although
written
by
one
who
already
knew
the
keyboard
the
last
a
valse
is
the
brightest
of
the
set
the
theme
is
german
the
fantaisie
op
in
a
on
polish
airs
preceded
by
an
introduction
in
f
sharp
minor
is
dedicated
to
the
pianist
pixis
it
was
published
in
april
it
is
chopin
brilliant
its
orchestral
background
does
not
count
for
much
but
the
energy
the
color
and
polish
character
of
the
piece
endeared
it
to
the
composer
he
played
it
often
and
as
kleczynski
asks
are
these
brilliant
passages
these
cascades
of
pearly
notes
these
bold
leaps
the
sadness
and
the
despair
of
which
we
hear
is
it
not
rather
youth
exuberant
with
intensity
and
life
is
it
not
happiness
gayety
love
for
the
world
and
men
the
melancholy
notes
are
there
to
bring
out
to
enforce
the
principal
ideas
for
instance
in
the
fantaisie
op
the
theme
of
kurpinski
moves
and
saddens
us
but
the
composer
does
not
give
time
for
this
impression
to
become
durable
he
suspends
it
by
means
of
a
long
trill
and
then
suddenly
by
a
few
chords
and
with
a
brilliant
prelude
leads
us
to
a
popular
dance
which
makes
us
mingle
with
the
peasant
couples
of
mazovia
does
the
finale
indicate
by
its
minor
key
the
gayety
of
a
man
devoid
of
hope
as
the
germans
say
kleczynski
then
tells
us
that
a
polish
proverb
a
fig
for
misery
is
the
keynote
of
a
nation
that
dances
furiously
to
music
in
the
minor
key
elevated
beauty
not
sepulchral
gayety
is
the
character
of
polish
of
chopin
music
this
is
a
valuable
hint
there
are
variations
in
the
fantaisie
which
end
with
a
merry
and
vivacious
kujawiak
the
f
minor
fantaisie
will
be
considered
later
neither
by
its
magnificent
content
construction
nor
opus
number
does
it
fall
into
this
chapter
the
allegro
de
concert
in
a
op
was
published
in
november
and
dedicated
to
mlle
friederike
muller
a
pupil
of
chopin
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
concerto
and
is
indeed
a
truncated
one
much
more
so
than
schumann
f
minor
sonata
called
concert
sans
orchestre
there
are
tutti
in
the
chopin
work
the
solo
part
not
really
beginning
until
the
bar
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
these
long
introductory
passages
are
ineffective
for
the
player
the
allegro
is
one
of
chopin
most
difficult
works
it
abounds
in
risky
skips
ambuscades
of
dangerous
double
notes
and
the
principal
themes
are
bold
and
expressive
the
color
note
is
strikingly
adapted
for
public
performance
and
perhaps
schumann
was
correct
in
believing
that
chopin
had
originally
sketched
this
for
piano
and
orchestra
niecks
asks
if
this
is
not
the
fragment
of
a
concerto
for
two
pianos
which
chopin
in
a
letter
written
at
vienna
december
said
he
would
play
in
public
with
his
friend
nidecki
if
he
succeeded
in
writing
it
to
his
satisfaction
and
is
there
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
chopin
when
sending
this
manuscript
to
fontana
probably
in
the
summer
of
calls
it
a
concerto
while
it
adds
little
to
chopin
reputation
it
has
the
potentialities
of
a
powerful
and
more
manly
composition
than
either
of
the
two
concertos
jean
louis
nicode
has
given
it
an
orchestral
garb
besides
arranging
it
for
two
pianos
he
has
added
a
developing
section
of
seventy
bars
this
version
was
first
played
in
new
york
a
decade
ago
by
marie
geselschap
a
dutch
pianist
under
the
direction
of
the
late
anton
seidl
the
original
it
must
be
acknowledged
is
preferable
the
bolero
op
has
a
polonaise
flavor
there
is
but
little
spanish
in
its
ingredients
it
is
merely
a
memorandum
of
chopin
early
essays
in
dance
forms
it
was
published
in
four
years
before
visit
to
spain
niecks
thinks
it
an
early
work
that
it
can
be
made
effective
was
proven
by
emil
sauer
it
is
for
pianists
and
the
principal
theme
has
the
rhythmical
ring
of
the
polonaise
although
the
most
iberian
in
character
it
is
dedicated
to
comtesse
de
flahault
in
the
key
of
a
minor
its
coda
ends
in
a
major
willeby
says
it
is
in
c
major
the
tarantella
is
in
a
flat
and
is
numbered
op
it
was
published
in
and
bears
no
dedication
composed
at
nohant
it
is
as
little
italian
as
the
bolero
is
spanish
chopin
visit
to
italy
was
of
too
short
a
duration
to
affect
him
at
least
in
the
style
of
dance
it
is
without
the
necessary
ophidian
tang
and
far
inferior
to
heller
and
liszt
efforts
in
the
constricted
form
one
finds
little
of
the
frenzy
ascribed
to
it
by
schumann
in
his
review
it
breathes
of
the
north
not
the
south
and
ranks
far
below
the
a
flat
impromptu
in
geniality
and
grace
the
c
minor
funeral
march
composed
according
to
fontana
in
sounds
like
mendelssohn
the
trio
has
the
processional
quality
of
a
parisian
funeral
cortege
it
is
modest
and
in
no
wise
remarkable
the

ecossaises
published
as

schottisches
nothing
more
no
in
g
is
highly
popular
in

the
grand

concertant
for

jointly
composed
by
chopin
and
franchomme
on
themes
from
robert
le
diable
it
begins
in
e
and
ends
in
a
major
and
is
without
opus
number
schumann
thinks
chopin
sketched
the
whole
of
it
and
that
franchomme
said
to
everything
it
is
for
the
salon
of
when
it
was
published
it
is
empty
tiresome
and
only
slightly
superior
to
compositions

the
same
sort

full

rapid
elegancies
and
shallow
passage
work
this
duo
is
certainly
a
piece
the
occasion
probably
being
the
need
of
ready
money
the
seventeen
polish
songs
were
composed
between
and
in
the
psychology
of
the
lied
chopin
was
not
happy
karasowski
writes
that
many
of
the
songs
were
lost
and
some
of
them
are
still
sung
in
poland
their
origin
being
hazy
the
third
of
may
is
cited
as
one
of
these
chopin
had
a
habit
of
playing
songs
for
his
friends
but
neglected
putting
some
of
them
on
paper
the
collected
songs
are
under
the
opus
head
the
words
are
by
his
friends
stephen
witwicki
adam

by

in
the

lesson
of
the

of

there

in

most
of

may
find
a
true
bit
of

a
word
of
recommendation
may
not
be
amiss
here
regarding
the
technical
study
of
chopin
kleczynski
in
his
two
books
gives
many
valuable
hints
and
isidor
philipp
has
published
a
set
of
exercises
quotidiens
made
up
of
specimens
in
double
notes
octaves
and
passages
taken
from
the
works
here
skeletonized
are
the
special
technical
problems
in
these
daily
studies
and
his
edition
of
the
etudes
are
numerous
examples
dealt
with
practically
for
a
study
of

ornaments
mertke

discussed
at
length
the
various

in
the
matter
of
attacking

and

also
the

of

is
in
his
sentimental
salon
mood
musically
it
is
the
most
impressive
of
this
extraordinary
mastodonic
survival
of
the
pianistic
past
the
newly
published
fugue
or
fugato
in
a
minor
in
two
voices
is
from
a
manuscript
in
the
possession
of
natalie
janotha
who
probably
got
it
from
the
late
princess
czartoryska
a
pupil
of
the
composer
the
composition
is
ineffective
and
in
spots
ugly
particularly
in
the
stretta
and
is
no
doubt
an
exercise
during
the
working
years
with
elsner
the
fact
that
in
the
coda
the
very
suspicious
octave
and
trills
may
be
omitted
so
the
editorial
note
urns
leads
one
to
suspect
that
out
of
a
fragment
janotha
has
evolved
an
entire
composition
chopin
as
does
not
appear
in
a
brilliant
light
is
the
polish
composer
to
become
a
musical
hugh
conway
why
all
these
disjecta
membra
of
a
in
these
youthful
works
may
be
found
the
beginnings
of
the
greater
chopin
but
not
his
vast
subjugation
of
the
purely
technical
to
the
poetic
and
spiritual
that
came
later
to
the
devout
chopinist
the
first
compositions
are
so
many
proofs
of
the
joyful
victorious
spirit
of
the
man
whose
spleen
and
pessimism
have
been
wrongfully
compared
to
leopardi
and
baudelaire
chopin
was
gay
fairly
healthy
and
bubbling
over
with
a
pretty
malice
his
first
period
shows
this
it
also
shows
how
thorough
and
painful
the
processes
by
which
he
evolved
his
final
style
xii
the
polonaises
heroic
hymns
of
battle
how
is
one
to
reconcile
the
want
of
manliness
moral
and
intellectual
which
hadow
asserts
is
the
one
great
limitation
of
chopin
province
with
the
power
splendor
and
courage
of
the
polonaises
here
are
the
cannon
buried
in
flowers
of
robert
schumann
here
overwhelming
evidences
of
versatility
virility
and
passion
chopin
blinded
his
critics
and
admirers
alike
a
delicate
puny
fellow
he
could
play
the
piano
on
occasion
like
a
devil
incarnate
he
too
had
his
demon
as
well
as
liszt
and
only
as
ehlert
puts
it
theoretical
fear
of
this
spirit
driving
him
over
the
cliffs
of
reason
made
him
curb
its
antics
after
all
the
couleur
de
rose
portraits
and
lollipop
miniatures
made
of
him
by
pensive
poetic
persons
it
is
not
possible
to
conceive
chopin
as
being
irascible
and
almost
brutal
yet
he
was
at
times
even
this
beethoven
was
scarce
more
vehement
and
irritable
writes
ehlert
and
we
remember
the
stories
of
friends
and
pupils
who
have
seen
this
slender
refined
pole
wrestling
with
his
wrath
as
one
under
the
obsession
of
a
fiend
it
is
no
desire
to
exaggerate
this
side
of
his
nature
that
impels
this
plain
writing
chopin
left
compositions
that
bear
witness
to
his
masculine
side
diminutive
in
person
became
him
ill
besides
his
whole
education
and
tastes
were
opposed
to
scenes
of
violence
so
this
energy
spleen
and
raging
at
fortune
found
escape
in
some
of
his
music
became
psychical
in
its
manifestations
but
you
may
say
this
is
feminine
hysteria
the
impotent
cries
of
an
unmanly
weak
nature
read
the
e
flat
minor
the
c
minor
the
a
major
the
f
sharp
minor
and
the
two
a
flat
major
polonaises
ballades
scherzi
studies
preludes
and
the
great
f
minor
fantaisie
are
purposely
omitted
from
this
awing
scheme
chopin
was
weak
in
physique
but
he
had
the
soul
of
a
lion
allied
to
the
most
exquisite
poetic
sensibilities
one
is
reminded
here
of
balzac
ce
beau
genie
est
moins
un
musicien
dine
qui
se
rend
sensible
there
was
another
nature
fiery
implacable
he
loved
poland
he
hated
her
oppressors
there
is
no
doubt
he
idealized
his
country
and
her
wrongs
until
the
theme
grew
out
of
all
proportion
politically
the
poles
and
celts
rub
shoulders
niecks
points
out
that
if
chopin
was
a
flattering
idealist
as
a
national
poet
as
a
personal
poet
he
was
an
uncompromising
realist
so
in
the
polonaises
we
find
two
distinct
groups
in
one
the
objective
martial
side
predominates
in
the
other
is
chopin
the
moody
mournful
and
morose
but
in
all
the
polish
element
pervades
barring
the
mazurkas
these
dances
are
the
most
polish
of
his
works
appreciation
of
chopin
wide
diversity
of
temperament
would
have
sparedthe
world
the
false
silly
distorted
portraits
of
him
he
had
the
warrior
in
him
even
if
his
mailed
fist
was
seldom
used
there
are
moments
when
he
discards
gloves
and
soft
phrases
and
deals
blows
that
reverberate
with
formidable
clangor
by
all
means
read
liszt
gorgeous
description
of
the
polonaise
originating
during
the
last
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
at
first
a
measured
procession
of
nobles
and
their
womankind
to
the
sound
of
music
in
the
court
of
henry
of
anjou
in
after
his
election
to
the
polish
throne
the
polonaise
was
born
and
throve
in
the
hardy
warlike
atmosphere
it
became
a
dance
political
and
had
words
set
to
it
thus
came
the
kosciuszko
the
oginski
the
moniuszko
the
kurpinski
and
a
long
list
written
by
composers
with
names
ending
in
ski
it
is
really
a
march
a
processional
dance
grave
moderate
flowing
and
by
no
means
stereotyped
liszt
tells
of
the
capricious
life
infused
into
its
courtly
measures
by
the
polish
aristocracy
it
is
at
once
the
symbol
of
war
and
love
a
vivid
pageant
of
martial
splendor
a
weaving
cadenced
voluptuous
dance
the
pursuit
of
shy
coquettish
woman
by
the
fierce
warrior
the
polonaise
is
in
time
with
the
accent
on
the
second
beat
of
the
bar
in
simple
binary
form
ternary
if
a
trio
is
added
this
dance
has
feminine
endings
to
all
the
principal
cadences
the
rhythmical
cast
of
the
bass
is
seldom
changed
despite
its
essentially
masculine
mould
it
is
given
a
feminine
title
formerly
it
was
called
polonais
liszt
wrote
of
it
in
this
form
the
noblest
traditional
feelings
of
ancient
poland
are
represented
the
polonaise
is
the
true
and
purest
type
of
polish
national
character
as
in
the
course
of
centuries
it
was
developed
partly
through
the
political
position
of
the
kingdom
toward
east
and
west
partly
through
an
undefinable
peculiar
inborn
disposition
of
the
entire
race
in
the
development
of
the
polonaise
everything
which
specifically
distinguished
the
nation
from
others
in
the
poles
of
departed
times
manly
resolution
was
united
with
glowing
devotion
to
the
object
of
their
love
their
knightly
heroism
was
sanctioned
by
dignity
and
even
the
laws
of
gallantry
and
the
national
costume
exerted
an
influence
over
the
turns
of
this
dance
the
polonaises
are
the
keystone
in
the
development
of
this
form
they
belong
to
the
most
beautiful
of
chopin
inspirations
with
their
energetic
rhythm
they
electrify
to
the
point
of
excited
demonstration
even
the
sleepiest
indifferentism
chopin
was
born
too
late
and
left
his
native
hearth
too
early
to
be
initiated
into
the
original
character
of
the
polonaise
as
danced
through
his
own
observation
but
what
others
imparted
to
him
in
regard
to
it
was
supplemented
by
his
fancy
and
his
nationality
chopin
wrote
fifteen
polonaises
the
authenticity
of
one
in
g
flat
major
being
doubted
by
niecks
this
list
includes
the
polonaise
for
violoncello
and
piano
op
and
the
polonaise
op
for
piano
and
orchestra
this
latter
polonaise
is
preceded
by
an
andante
spianato
in
g
in
time
and
unaccompanied
it
is
a
charming
composition
chopin
in
his
most
suave
his
most
placid
mood
a
barcarolle
scarcely
a
ripple
of
emotion
disturbs
the
mirrored
calm
of
this
lake
after
sixteen
bars
of
a
crudely
harmonized
tutti
comes
the
polonaise
in
the
widely
remote
key
of
e
flat
it
is
brilliant
every
note
telling
the
figuration
rich
and
novel
the
movement
spirited
and
flowing
perhaps
it
is
too
long
and
lacks
relief
the
theme
on
each
is
varied
ornamentally
the
second
theme
in
c
minor
has
a
polish
and
poetic
ring
while
the
coda
is
effective
this
opus
is
vivacious
but
not
characterized
by
great
depth
crystalline
gracious
and
refined
the

this
according
to
niecks
was

only

it
was
practically
a
novelty
to
new

when
rafael

played
it
here
superlatively
well
in
the
orchestral
part
seems
wholly
superfluous

the
scoring

not

there

scharwenka
first
played
this
arrangement
at
a
seidl
memorial
concert
in
chickering
hall
new
york
april
yet
i
can
not
truthfully
say
the
polonaise
sounds
so
characteristic
as
when
played
solo
the
c
sharp
minor
polonaise
op
has
had
the
misfortune
of
being
sentimentalized
to
death
what
can
be
more
appassionata
than
the
opening
with
its
grand
rhythmical
swing
it
is
usually
played
by
timid
persons
in
a
fashion
although
fff
stares
them
in
the
face
the
first
three
lines
are
hugely
heroic
but
the
indignation
soon
melts
away
leaving
an
apathetic
humor
after
the
theme
returns
and
is
repeated
we
get
a
genuine
love
motif
tender
enough
in
all
faith
wherewith
to
woo
a
princess
on
this
the
polonaise
closes
an
odd
ending
for
such
a
fiery
opening
in
no
such
mood
does
no
begin
in
e
flat
minor
it
is
variously
known
as
the
siberian
the
revolt
polonaise
it
breathes
defiance
and
rancor
from
the
start
what
suppressed
and
threatening
rumblings
are
there
volcanic
mutterings
these
musical
score
excerpt
it
is
a
sinister
page
and
all
the
more
so
because
of
the
injunction
to
open
with
pianissimo
one
wishes
that
the
shrill
high
g
flat
had
been
written
in
full
chords
as
the
theme
suffers
from
a
want
of
massiveness
then
follows
a
subsidiary
but
the
principal
subject
returns
relentlessly
the
episode
in
b
major
gives
pause
for
breathing
it
has
a
hint
of
meyerbeer
but
again
with
smothered
explosions
the
polonaise
proper
appears
and
all
ends
in
gloom
and
the
impotent
clanking
of
chains
it
is
an
work
this
terrible
polonaise
in
e
flat
minor
op
it
was
published
july
and
is
dedicated
to
dessauer
not
so
the
celebrated
a
major
polonaise
op
le

to
rubinstein
this
seemed
a
picture
of
poland
greatness
as
its
companion
in
c
minor
is
of
poland
downfall
although
karasowski
and
kleczynski
give
to
the
a
flat
major
polonaise
the
honor
of
suggesting
a
story
it
is
really
the
a
major
that
provoked
it
so
the
polish
portrait
painter
kwiatowski
informed
niecks
the
story
runs
that
after
composing
it
chopin
in
the
dreary
watches
of
the
night
was
surprised
terrified
is
a
better
word
by
the
opening
of
his
door
and
the
entrance
of
a
long
train
of
polish
nobles
and
ladies
richly
robed
who
moved
slowly
by
him
troubled
by
the
ghosts
of
the
past
he
had
raised
the
composer
hollow
eyed
fled
the
apartment
all
this
must
have
been
at
majorca
for
op
was
composed
or
finished
there
ailing
weak
and
unhappy
as
he
was
chopin
had
grit
enough
to
file
and
polish
this
brilliant
and
striking
composition
into
its
present
shape
it
is
the
best
known
and
though
the
most
muscular
of
his
compositions
it
is
the
most
played
it
is
dedicated
to
fontana
and
was
published
november
this
polonaise
has
the
festive
glitter
of
weber
the
c
minor
polonaise
of
the
same
set
is
a
noble
troubled
composition
large
in
accents
and
deeply
felt
can
anything
be
more
impressive
than
this
opening
musical
score
excerpt
it
is
indeed
poland
downfall
the
trio
in
a
flat
with
its
kaleidoscopic
modulations
produces
an
impression
of
vague
unrest
and
suppressed
sorrow
there
is
loftiness
of
spirit
and
daring
in
it
what
can
one
say
new
of
the
tremendous
f
sharp
minor
polonaise
willeby
calls
it
noisy
and
stanislaw
przybyszewski
whom
vance
thompson
christened
a
prestidigious
literally
stormed
over
it
it
is
barbaric
it
is
perhaps
pathologic
and
of
it
liszt
has
said
most
eloquent
things
it
is
for
him
a
dream
poem
the
lurid
hour
that
precedes
a
hurricane
with
a
convulsive
shudder
at
the
close
the
opening
is
very
impressive
the
being
harassed
by
the
gradually
swelling
prelude
there
is
defiant
power
in
the
first
theme
and
the
constant
reference
to
it
betrays
the
composer
exasperated
mental
condition
this
tendency
to
return
upon
himself
a
tormenting
introspection
certainly
signifies
a
grave
state
but
consider
the
musical
weight
of
the
work
the
recklessly
bold
outpourings
of
a
mind
almost
distraught
there
is
no
greater
test
for
the
than
the
f
sharp
minor
polonaise
it
is
profoundly
ironical
what
else
means
the
introduction
of
that
lovely
mazurka
a
flower
between
two
abysses
this
strange
dance
is
ushered
in
by
two
of
the
most
enigmatic
pages
of
chopin
the
a
major
intermezzo
with
its
booming
cannons
and
reverberating
overtones
is
not
easily
defensible
on
the
score
of
form
yet
it
unmistakably
fits
in
the
picture
the
mazurka
is
full
of
interrogation
and
emotional
nuanciren
the
return
of
the
tempest
is
not
long
delayed
it
bursts
wanes
and
with
the
coda
comes
sad
yearning
then
the
savage
drama
passes
tremblingly
into
the
night
after
fluid
and
wavering
affirmations
a
roar
in
f
sharp
and
finally
a
silence
that
marks
the
cessation
of
an
agitating
nightmare
no
sabre

but
a
confession
from
the
dark
depths
of

soul
op

published
november
and

there
are
few
editorial
differences
in
the
eighteenth
bar
from
the
beginning
kullak
in
the
second
beat
fills
out
an
octave
not
so
in
klindworth
nor
in
the
original
at
the
twentieth
bar
klindworth
differs
from
the
original
as
follows
the

musical
score
excerpts
the
a
flat
polonaise
op
was
published
december
and
is
said
by
karasowski
to
have
been
composed
in
after
chopin
return
from
majorca
it
is
dedicated
to
leo
this
is
the
one
karasowski
calls
the
story
of
chopin
vision
of
the
antique
dead
in
an
isolated
tower
of
madame
sand
chateau
at
nohant
we
have
seen
this
legend
disproved
by
one
who
knows
this
polonaise
is
not
as
feverish
and
as
exalted
as
the
previous
one
it
is
as
kleczynski
writes
the
type
of
a
war
song
named
the
heroique
one
hears
in
it
ehlert
ring
of
damascene
blade
and
silver
spur
there
is
imaginative
splendor
in
this
thrilling
work
with
its
thunder
of
horses
hoofs
and
fierce
challengings
what
fire
what
sword
thrusts
and
smoke
and
clash
of
mortal
conflict
here
is
no
psychical
presentation
but
an
objective
picture
of
battle
of
concrete
contours
and
with
a
cleaving
brilliancy
that
excites
the
blood
to
boiling
pitch
that
chopin
ever
played
it
as
intended
is
incredible
none
but
the
heroes
of
the
keyboard
may
grasp
its
dense
chordal
masses
its
fiery
projectiles
of
tone
but
there
is
something
disturbing
even
ghostly
in
the
strange
intermezzo
that
separates
the
trio
from
the
polonaise
both
mist
and
starlight
are
in
it
yet
the
work
is
played
too
fast
and
has
been
nicknamed
the
drum
polonaise
losing
in
majesty
and
force
because
of
the
vanity
of
virtuosi
the
octaves
in
e
major
are
spun
out
as
if
speed
were
the
sole
idea
of
this
episode
follow
kleczynski
advice
and
do
not
sacrifice
the
polonaise
to
the
octaves
karl
tausig
so
joseffy
and
de
lenz
assert
played
this
polonaise
in
an
unapproachable
manner
powerful
battle
tableau
as
it
is
it
may
still
be
presented
so
as
not
to
shock
one
sense
of
the
euphonious
of
the
limitations
of
the
instrument
this
work
becomes
vapid
and
unheroic
when
transferred
to
the
orchestra
the
in
a
flat
op
given
to
the
world
september
is
dedicated
to
madame
veyret
one
of
three
great
polonaises
it
is
just
beginning
to
be
understood
having
been
derided
as
amorphous
febrile
of
little
musical
moment
even
liszt
declaring
that
such
pictures
possess
but
little
real
value
to
art
deplorable
visions
which
the
artist
should
admit
with
extreme
circumspection
within
the
graceful
circle
of
his
charmed
realm
this
was
written
in
the
days
when
art
was
aristocratic
and
excluded
the
baser
and
more
painful
emotions
for
a
generation
accustomed
to
the
realism
of
richard
strauss
the
seems
vaporous
and
idealistic
withal
new
it
recalls
one
of
those
enchanted
flasks
of
the
magii
from
which
on
opening
smoke
exhales
that
gradually
shapes
itself
into
fantastic
and
fearsome
figures
this
polonaise
at
no
time
exhibits
the
solidity
of
its
two
predecessors
its
plasticity
defies
the
imprint
of
the
conventional
polonaise
though
we
ever
feel
its
rhythms
it
may
be
full
of
monologues
interspersed
cadenzas
improvised
preludes
and
short
phrases
as
kullak
suggests
yet
there
is
unity
in
the
composition
the
units
of
structure
and
style
it
was
music
of
the
future
when
chopin
composed
it
is
now
music
of
the
present
as
much
as
richard
wagner
but
the
realism
is
a
trifle
clouded
here
is
the
duality
of
chopin
the
suffering
man
and
chopin
the
prophet
of
poland
undimmed
is
his
poetic
vision
poland
will
be
free
undaunted
his
soul
though
oppressed
by
a
suffering
body
there
are
in
the
work
throes
of
agony
blended
with
the
trumpet
notes
of
triumph
and
what
puzzled
our
fathers
the
shifting
lights
and
shadows
the
restless
tonalities
are
welcome
for
at
the
beginning
of
this
new
century
the
chromatic
is
king
the
ending
of
this
polonaise
is
triumphant
recalling
in
key
and
climaxing
the
a
flat
ballade
chopin
is
still
the
captain
of
his
soul
and
poland
will
be
free
are
celt
and
slav
doomed
to
follow
ever
the
phosphorescent
lights
of
patriotism
liszt
acknowledges
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
this
last
polonaise
which
unites
the
characteristics
of
superb
and
original
manipulation
of
the
form
the
martial
and
the
melancholic
opus

posthumous

by

they
are
interesting
to

the
influence
of
weber
a
past
master
in
this
form
is
felt
of
the
three
the
last
in
f
minor
is
the
strongest
although
if
chopin
age
is
taken
into
consideration
the
first
in
d
minor
is
a
feat
for
a
lad
of
eighteen
i
agree
with
niecks
that
the
posthumous
polonaise
without
opus
number
in
g
sharp
minor
was
composed
later
than
the
date
given
in
the

it
is
an
artistic
conception
and
in
light

figuration
far
more
mature
than
the
chopin
of

really
a
graceful
and
effective
little

of

it

the
characteristic
physiognomy
of
the

in

this

is
thin
a
tentative
groping

there

an

writer
describes
the
dancing
of
the
mazurka
in
contemporary
russia
in
the
salons
of
petersburg
for
instance
the
guests
actually
dance
they
do
not
merely
shamble
to
and
fro
in
a
crowd
crumpling
their
clothes
and
ruffling
their
tempers
and
call
it
a
set
of
quadrilles
they
have
ample
space
for
the
sweeping
movements
and
complicated
figures
of
all
the
orthodox
ball
dances
and
are
generally
gifted
with
sufficient
plastic
grace
to
carry
them
out
in
style
they
carefully
cultivate
dances
calling
for
a
kind
of
grace
which
is
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
art
the
mazurka
is
one
of
the
finest
of
these
and
it
is
quite
a
favorite
at
balls
on
the
banks
of

good
deal
of
room

more

which
the
partners
rush

clinking

as

in

punctuating
the
staccato
of

loud

sibilant

more
genuine
pleasure
in

thrilling
dance
like
that
than
in
taking
an
active
part
in
the
lifeless
performed
at

balls
in
many
of
the
more
western
countries
of
europe
absolutely
slavonic
though
a
local
dance
of
the
province
of
mazovia
the
mazurek
or
mazurka
is
written
in
time
with
the
usual
displaced
accent
in
music
of
eastern
origin
brodzinski
is
quoted
as
saying
that
in
its
primitive
form
the
mazurek
is
only
a
kind
of
krakowiak
less
lively
less
sautillant
at
its
best
it
is
a
dancing
anecdote
a
story
told
in
a
charming
variety
of
steps
and
gestures
it
is
intoxicating
rude
humorous
poetic
above
all
melancholy
when
he
is
happiest
he
sings
his
saddest
does
the
pole
hence
his
predilection
for
minor
modes
the
mazurka
is
in
or
time
sometimes
the
accent
is
dotted
but
this
is
by
no
means
absolute
here
is
the
rhythm
most
frequently
encountered
although
chopin
employs
variants
and
modifications
the
first
part
of
the
bar
has
usually
the
quicker
notes
the
scale
is
a
mixture
of
major
and
minor
melodies
are
encountered
that
grew
out
of
a
scale
shorn
of
a
degree
occasionally
the
augmented
second
the
hungarian
is
encountered
and
skips
of
a
third
are
of
frequent
occurrence
this
with
progressions
of
augmented
fourths
and
major
sevenths
gives
to
the
mazurkas
of
chopin
an
exotic
character
apart
from
their
novel
and
original
content
as
was
the
case
with
the
polonaise
chopin
took
the
framework
of
the
national
dance
developed
it
enlarged
it
and
hung
upon
it
his
choicest
melodies
his
most
piquant
harmonies
he
breaks
and
varies
the
conventionalized
rhythm
in
a
half
hundred
ways
lifting
to
the
plane
of
a
poem
the
heavy
hoofed
peasant
dance
but
in
this
idealization
he
never
robs
it
altogether
of
the
flavor
of
the
soil
it
is
in
all
its
wayward
disguises
the
polish
mazurka
and
is
with
the
polonaise
according
to
rubinstein
the
only
music
he
has
made
although
in
all
of
his
compositions
we
hear
him
relate
rejoicingly
of
poland
vanished
greatness
singing
mourning
weeping
over
poland
downfall
and
all
that
in
the
most
beautiful
the
most
musical
way
besides
the
hard
inartistic
modulations
the
startling
progressions
and
abrupt
changes
of
mood
that
jarred
on
the
moscheles
and
dipped
in
vitriol
the
pen
of
rellstab
there
is
in
the
mazurkas
the
greatest
stumbling
block
of
all
the
much
exploited
rubato
berlioz
swore
that
chopin
could
not
play
in
time
which
was
not
true
and
later
we
shall
see
that
meyerbeer
thought
the
same
what
to
the
sensitive
critic
is
a
charming
wavering
and
swaying
in
the
measure
chopin
leans
about
freely
within
his
bars
wrote
an
english
critic
for
the
classicists
was
a
rank
departure
from
the
time
beat
according
to
description
of
the
rubato
a
wind
plays
in
the
leaves
life
unfolds
and
develops
beneath
them
but
the
tree
remains
the
same
that
is
the
chopin
rubato
elsewhere
a
tempo
agitated
broken
interrupted
a
movement
flexible
yet
at
the
same
time
abrupt
and
languishing
and
vacillating
as
the
fluctuating
breath
by
which
it
is
agitated
chopin
was
more
commonplace
in
his
definition
supposing
he
explained
that
a
piece
lasts
a
given
number
of
minutes
it
may
take
just
so
long
to
perform
the
whole
but
in
detail
deviations
may
differ
the
tempo
rubato
is
probably
as
old
as
music
itself
it
is
in
bach
it
was
practised
by
the
old
italian
singers
mikuli
says
that
no
matter
how
free
chopin
was
in
his
treatment
of
the
right
hand
in
melody
or
arabesque
the
left
kept
strict
time
mozart
and
not
chopin
it
was
who
first
said
let
your
left
hand
be
your
conductor
and
always
keep
time
halle
the
pianist
once
asserted
that
he
proved
chopin
to
be
playing
instead
of
measure
in
a
mazurka
chopin
laughingly
admitted
that
it
was
a
national
trait
halle
was
bewildered
when
he
first
heard
chopin
play
for
he
did
not
believe
such
music
could
be
represented
by
musical
signs
still
he
holds
that
this
style
has
been
woefully
exaggerated
by
pupils
and
imitators
if
a
beethoven
symphony
or
a
bach
fugue
be
played
with
metronomical
rigidity
it
loses
its
quintessential
flavor
is
it
not
time
the
ridiculous
falsehoods
about
the
chopin
rubato
be
exposed
naturally
abhorring
anything
that
would
do
violence
to
the
structural
part
of
his
compositions
chopin
was
a
very
martinet
with
his
pupils
if
too
much
license
of
tempo
was
taken
his
music
needs
the
greatest
lucidity
in
presentation
and
naturally
a
certain
elasticity
of
phrasing
rhythms
need
not
be
distorted
nor
need
there
be
absurd
and
vulgar
haltings
silly
and
explosive
dynamics
chopin
sentimentalized
is
chopin
butchered
he
loathed
false
sentiment
and
a
man
whose
taste
was
formed
by
bach
and
mozart
who
was
nurtured
by
the
music
of
these
two
giants
could
never
have
indulged
in
exaggerated
jerky
tempi
in
meaningless
expression
come
let
us
be
done
with
this
fetish
of
stolen
time
of
the
wonderful
and
so
seldom
comprehended
rubato
if
you
wish
to
play
chopin
play
him
in
curves
let
there
be
no
angularities
of
surface
of
measure
but
in
the
name
of
the
beautiful
do
not
deliver
his
exquisitely
balanced
phrases
with
the
jolting
balky
eloquence
of
a
cafe
chantant
singer
the
very
balance
and
symmetry
of
the
chopin
phraseology
are
internal
it
must
be
delivered
in
a
flowing
waving
manner
never
square
or
hard
yet
with
every
accent
showing
like
the
supple
muscles
of
an
athlete
beneath
his
skin
without
the
skeleton
a
musical
composition
is
flaccid
shapeless
weak
and
without
character
chopin
music
needs
a
rhythmic
sense
that
to
us
fed
upon
the
few
simple
forms
of
the
west
seems
almost
abnormal
the
chopin
rubato
is
rhythm
liberated
from
its
scholastic
bonds
but
it
does
not
mean
anarchy
disorder
what
makes
this
popular
misconception
all
the
more
singular
is
the
freedom
with
which
the
classics
are
now
being
interpreted
a
beethoven
and
even
a
mozart
symphony
no
longer
means
a
rigorous
execution
in
which
the
measure
is
ruthlessly
hammered
out
by
the
conductor
but
the
melodic
and
emotional
curve
is
followed
and
the
tempo
fluctuates
why
then
is
chopin
singled
out
as
the
evil
and
solitary
representative
of
a
vicious
play
him
as
you
play
mendelssohn
and
your
chopin
has
evaporated
again
play
him
lawlessly
with
his
accentual
life
and
he
is
no
longer
chopin
his
caricature
only
pianists
of
slavic
descent
alone
understand
the
secret
of
the
tempo
rubato
i
have
read
in
a
recently
started
german
periodical
that
to
make
the
performance
of
chopin
works
pleasing
it
is
sufficient
to
play
them
with
less
precision
of
rhythm
than
the
music
of
other
composers
i
on
the
contrary
do
not
know
a
single
phrase
of
chopin
works
including
even
the
freest
among
them
in
which
the
balloon
of
inspiration
as
it
moves
through
the
air
is
not
checked
by
an
anchor
of
rhythm
and
symmetry
such
passages
as
occur
in
the
f
minor
ballade
the
b
flat
minor
scherzo
the
middle
part
the
f
minor
prelude
and
even
the
a
flat
impromptu
are
not
devoid
of
rhythm
the
most
crooked
recitative
of
the
f
minor
concerto
as
can
be
easily
proved
has
a
fundamental
rhythm
not
at
all
fantastic
and
which
can
not
be
dispensed
with
when
playing
with
orchestra
chopin
never
overdoes
fantasy
and
is
always
restrained
by
a
pronounced
aesthetical
instinct
everywhere
the
simplicity
of
his
poetical
inspiration
and
his
sobriety
saves
us
from
extravagance
and
false
pathos
kleczynski
has
this
in
his
second
volume
for
he
enjoyed
the
invaluable
prompting
of
chopin
pupil
the
late
princess
marceline
czartoryska
niecks
quotes
mme
friederike
stretcher
nee
muller
a
pupil
who
wrote
of
her
master
he
required
adherence
to
the
strictest
rhythm
hated
all
lingering
and
lagging
misplaced
rubatos
as
well
as
exaggerated
ritardandos
vous
prie
de
vous
asseoir
he
said
on
such
an
occasion
with
gentle
mockery
and
it
is
just
in
this
respect
that
people
make
such
terrible
mistakes
in
the
execution
of
his
works
and
now
to
the
mazurkas
which
de
lenz
said
were
heinrich
heine
songs
on
the
piano
chopin
was
a
phoenix
of
intimacy
with
the
piano
in
his
nocturnes
and
mazurkas
he
is
unrivalled
downright
fabulous
no
compositions
are
so
as
the
mazurkas
ironical
sad
sweet
joyous
morbid
sour
sane
and
dreamy
they
illustrate
what
was
said
of
their
composer
his
heart
is
sad
his
mind
is
gay
that
subtle
quality
for
an
occidental
enigmatic
which
the
poles
call
zal
is
in
some
of
them
in
others
the
fun
is
almost
rough
and
roaring
zal
a
poisonous
word
is
a
baleful
compound
of
pain
sadness
secret
rancor
revolt
it
is
a
polish
quality
and
is
in
the
celtic
peoples
oppressed
nations
with
a
tendency
to
mad
lyrism
develop
this
mental
secretion
of
the
spleen
liszt
writes
that
the
zal
colors
with
a
reflection
now
argent
now
ardent
the
whole
of
chopin
works
this
sorrow
is
the
very
soil
of
chopin
nature
he
so
confessed
when
questioned
by
comtesse
liszt
further
explains
that
the
strange
word
includes
in
its
meanings
for
it
seems
packed
with
them
all
the
tenderness
all
the
humility
of
a
regret
borne
with
resignation
and
without
a
murmur
it
also
signifies
excitement
agitation
rancor
revolt
full
of
reproach
premeditated
vengeance
menace
never
ceasing
to
threaten
if
retaliation
should
ever
become
possible
feeding
itself
meanwhile
with
a
bitter
if
sterile
hatred
sterile
indeed
must
be
such
a
consuming
passion
even
where
his
patriotism
became
a
lyric
cry
this
zal
tainted
the
source
of
joy
it
made
him
irascible
and
with
his
powers
of
repression
this
smouldering
smothered
rage
must
have
well
nigh
suffocated
him
and
in
the
end
proved
harmful
alike
to
his
person
and
to
his
art
as
in
certain
phases
of
disease
it
heightened
the
beauty
of
his
later
work
unhealthy
feverish
yet
beauty
without
doubt
the
pearl
is
said
to
be
a
morbid
secretion
so
the
spiritual
ferment
called
zal
gave
to
chopin
music
its
morbid
beauty
it
is
in
the
b
minor
scherzo
but
not
in
the
a
flat
ballade
the
f
minor
ballade
overflows
with
it
and
so
does
the
f
sharp
minor
polonaise
but
not
the
first
impromptu
its
dark
introspection
colors
many
of
the
preludes
and
mazurkas
and
in
the
c
sharp
minor
scherzo
it
is
in
acrid
flowering
truly
fleurs
du
mal
heine
and
baudelaire
two
poets
far
removed
from
the
slavic
show
traces
of
the
terrible
drowsy
zal
in
their
poetry
it
is
the
collective
sorrow
and
tribal
wrath
of
a
nation
and
the
mazurkas
for
that
reason
have
ethnic
value
as
concise
even
as
curt
as
the
preludes
they
are
for
the
most
part
highly
polished
they
are
dancing
preludes
and
often
tiny
single
poems
of
great

intensity

both
in

said

by
charles

and
four
others
in

d
and
c

this
makes
in
all
to
be
grouped
and
analyzed
niecks
thinks
there
is
a
difference
between
the
mazurkas
as
far
as
op
and
those
that
follow
in
the
latter
he
misses
savage
beauties
and
spontaneity
as
chopin
gripped
the
form
as
he
felt
more
suffered
more
and
knew
more
his
mazurkas
grew
broader
revealed
more
weltschmerz
became
elaborate
and
at
times
impersonal
but
seldom
lost
the
racial
snap
and
hue
they
are
sonnets
in
their
mecanisme
and
as
schumann
says
something
new
is
to
be
found
in
each
toward
the
last
a
few
are
blithe
and
jocund
but
they
are
the
exceptions
in
the
larger
ones
the
universal
quality
is
felt
but
to
the
detriment
of
the
intimate
polish
characteristics
these
mazurkas
are
just
what
they
are
called
only
some
dance
with
the
heart
others
with
the
heels
comprising
a
large
and
original
portion
of
chopin
compositions
they
are
the
least
known
perhaps
when
they
wander
from
the
map
of
poland
they
lose
some
of
their
native
fragrance
like
hardy
simple
wild
flowers
they
are
mostly
for
the
open
air
the
only
music
chopin
ever
made
but
even
in
the
open
under
the
moon
the
note
of
of
sophisticated
sadness
is
not
absent
do
not
accuse
chopin
for
this
is
the
of
his
race
the
pole
suffers
in
song
the
joy
of
his
sorrow
ii
the
f
sharp
minor
mazurka
of
op
begins
with
the
characteristic
triplet
that
plays
such
a
role
in
the
dance
here
we
find
a
chopin
fuller
fledged
than
in
the
nocturnes
and
variations
and
probably
because
of
the
form
this
mazurka
first
in
publication
is
melodious
slightly
mournful
but
of
a
delightful
freshness
the
third
section
with
the
appoggiaturas
realizes
a
vivid
vision
of
country
couples
dancing
determinedly
who
plays
no
of
this
set
it
too
has
the
native
wood
note
wild
with
its
dominant
pedal
bass
its
slight
twang
and
its
melody
in
c
sharp
minor
there
is
hearty
delight
in
the
major
and
how
natural
it
seems
no
in
e
is
still
on
the
village
green
and
the
boys
and
girls
are
romping
in
the
dance
we
hear
a
drone
bass
a
favorite
device
of
chopin
and
the
chatter
of
the
gossips
the
bustle
of
a
rural
festival
the
harmonization
is
rich
the
rhythmic
life
vital
but
in
the
following
one
in
e
flat
minor
a
different
note
is
sounded
its
harmonies
are
closer
and
there
is
sorrow
abroad
the
incessant
circling
around
one
idea
as
if
obsessed
by
fixed
grief
is
used
here
for
the
first
but
not
for
the
last
time
by
the
composer
opus
drew
attention
to
chopin
it
was
the
set
that
brought
down
the
thunders
of
rellstab
who
wrote
if
chopin
had
shown
this
composition
to
a
master
the
latter
would
it
is
to
be
hoped
have
torn
it
and
thrown
it
at
his
feet
which
we
hereby
do
symbolically
criticism
had
its
amenities
in
in
a
later
number
of
the
iris
in
which
a
caustic
notice
appeared
of
the
studies
op
rellstab
printed
a
letter
signed
chopin
the
authenticity
of
which
is
extremely
doubtful
in
it
chopin
is
made
to
call
the
critic
really
a
very
bad
man
niecks
demonstrates
that
the
polish
pianist
was
not
the
writer
it
reads
like
the
effusion
of
some
indignant
well
meaning
female
friend
the
b
flat
major
mazurka
which
opens
op
is
the
best
known
of
these
dances
there
is
an
expansive
swing
a
to
this
piece
with
its
air
of
elegance
that
are
very
alluring
the
rubato
flourishes
and
at
the
close
we
hear
the
footing
of
the
peasant
a
jolly
reckless
composition
that
makes
one
happy
to
be
alive
and
dancing
the
next
which
begins
in
a
minor
is
as
if
one
danced
upon
one
grave
a
change
to
major
does
not
deceive
it
is
too
no
in
f
minor
with
its
rhythmic
pronouncement
at
the
start
brings
us
back
to
earth
the
triplet
that
sets
off
the
phrase
has
great
significance
is
the
bass
in
its
snapping
resolution
the
section
that
begins
on
the
dominant
of
d
flat
is
full
of
vigor
and
imagination
the
left
hand
is
given
a
solo
this
mazurka
has
the
true
ring
the
following
one
in
a
flat
is
a
sequence
of
moods
its
assertiveness
soon
melts
into
tenderer
hues
and
in
an
episode
in
a
we
find
much
to
ponder
no
in
c
consists
of
three
lines
it
is
a
sort
of
coda
to
the
opus
and
full
of
the
echoes
of
lusty
happiness
a
silhouette
with
a
marked
profile
opus
no
in
b
flat
is
bold
chivalric
and
i
fancy
i
hear
the
swish
of
the
warrior
sabre
the
peasant
has
vanished
or
else
gapes
through
the
open
window
while
his
master
goes
through
the
paces
of
a
courtlier
dance
we
encounter
sequential
chords
of
the
seventh
and
their
use
rhythmically
framed
as
they
are
gives
a
line
of
sternness
to
the
dance
niecks
thinks
that
the
second
mazurka
might
be
called
the
request
so
pathetic
playful
and
persuasive
is
it
it
is
in
e
minor
and
has
a
plaintive
appealing
quality
the
g
major
part
is
very
pretty
in
the
last
lines
the
passion
mounts
but
is
never
shrill
kullak
notes
that
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
bars
there
is
no
slur
in
certain
editions
klindworth
employs
it
but
marks
the
b
sforzando
a
slur
on
two
notes
of
the
same
pitch
with
chopin
does
not
always
mean
a
tie
the
a
flat
mazurka
no
is
pessimistic
threatening
and
irritable
though
in
the
key
of
e
major
the
trio
displays
a
relentless
sort
of
humor
the
return
does
not
mend
matters
a
dark
page
in
a
minor
the
fourth
is
called
by
szulc
the
little
jew
szulc
who
wrote
anecdotes
of
chopin
and
collected
them
with
the
title
of
fryderyk
szopen
told
the
story
to
kleczynski
it
is
this
chopin
did
not
care
for
programme
music
though
more
than
one
of
his
compositions
full
of
expression
and
character
may
be
included
under
that
name
who
does
not
know
the
a
minor
mazurka
of
op
dedicated
to
lena
freppa
itwas
already
known
in
our
country
as
the
little
jew
before
the
departure
of
our
artist
abroad
it
is
one
of
the
works
of
chopin
which
are
characterized
by
distinct
humor
a
jew
in
slippers
and
a
long
robe
comes
out
of
his
inn
and
seeing
an
unfortunate
peasant
his
customer
intoxicated
tumbling
about
the
road
and
uttering
complaints
exclaims
from
his
threshold
what
is
this
then
as
if
by
way
of
contrast
to
this
scene
the
gay
wedding
party
of
a
rich
burgess
comes
along
on
its
way
from
church
with
shouts
of
various
kinds
accompanied
in
a
lively
manner
by
violins
and
bagpipes
the
train
passes
by
the
tipsy
peasant
renews
his
complaints
the
complaints
of
a
man
who
had
tried
to
drown
his
misery
in
the
glass
the
jew
returns
indoors
shaking
his
head
and
again
asking
what
was
this
the
story
strikes
one
as
being
both
childish
and
commonplace
the
mazurka
is
rather
doleful
and
there
is
a
little
triplet
of
interrogation
standing
sentinel
at
the
fourth
bar
it
is
also
the
last
phrase
but
what
of
that
i
too
can
build
you
a
programme
as
lofty
or
lowly
as
you
please
but
it
will
not
be
chopin
niecks
for
example
finds
this
very
dance
bleak
and
joyless
of
intimate
emotional
experience
and
with
jarring
tones
that
strike
in
and
pitilessly
wake
the
dreamer
so
there
is
no
predicating
the
content
of
music
except
in
a
general
way
the
mood
key
may
be
struck
but
in
chopin
case
this
is
by
no
means
infallible
if
i
write
with
confidence
it
is
that
begot
of
desperation
for
i
know
full
well
that
my
version
of
the
story
will
not
be
yours
the
a
minor
mazurka
for
me
is
full
of
hectic
despair
whatever
that
may
mean
and
its
serpentining
chromatics
and
apparently
suspended
close
on
the
chord
of
the
sixth
gives
an
impression
of
morbid
irresolution
modulating
into
a
sort
of
desperate
gayety
its
tonality
accounts
for
the
moods
evoked
being
indeterminate
and
restless
opus
begins
with
the
g
minor
mazurka
a
favorite
because
of
its
comparative
freedom
from
technical
difficulties
although
in
the
minor
mode
there
is
mental
strength
in
the
piece
with
its
exotic
scale
of
the
augmented
second
and
its
trio
is
hearty
in
the
next
in
c
we
find
besides
the
curious
content
a
mixture
of
tonalities
lydian
and
mediaeval
church
modes
here
the
trio
is
occidental
the
entire
piece
leaves
a
vague
impression
of
discontent
and
the
refrain
recalls
the
russian
bargemen
songs
utilized
at
various
times
by
tschaikowsky
klindworth
uses
variants
there
is
also
some
editorial
differences
in
the
metronomic
markings
mikuli
being
according
to
kullak
too
slow
mention
has
not
been
made
as
in
the
studies
and
preludes
of
the
tempi
of
the
mazurkas
these
compositions
are
so
capricious
so
varied
that
chopin
i
am
sure
did
not
play
any
one
of
them
twice
alike
they
are
creatures
of
moods
melodic
air
plants
swinging
to
the
rhythms
of
any
vagrant
breeze
the
metronome
is
for
the
student
but
metronome
and
rubato
are
as
de
lenz
would
have
said
mutually
exclusive
the
third
mazurka
of
op
is
in
a
flat
it
is
pleasing
not
deep
a
real
dance
with
an
ornamental
coda
but
the
next
ah
here
is
a
gem
a
beautiful
and
exquisitely
colored
poem
in
b
flat
minor
it
sends
out
prehensile
filaments
that
entwine
and
draw
us
into
the
centre
of
a
wondrous
melody
laden
with
rich
odors
odors
that
almost
intoxicate
the
figuration
is
tropical
and
when
the
major
is
reached
and
those
glancing
so
coyly
assail
us
we
realize
the
seductive
charm
of
chopin
the
reprise
is
still
more
festooned
and
it
is
almost
a
relief
when
the
little
tender
unison
begins
with
its
positive
chord
assertions
closing
the
period
then
follows
a
fascinating
cadenced
step
with
lights
and
shades
sweet
melancholy
driving
before
it
joy
and
being
routed
itself
until
the
annunciation
of
the
first
theme
and
the
dying
away
of
the
dance
dancers
and
the
solid
globe
itself
as
if
earth
had
committed
suicide
for
loss
of
the
sun
the
last
two
bars
could
have
been
written
only
by
chopin
they
are
ineffable
sighs
and
now
the
chorus
of
praise
begins
to
mount
in
burning
octaves
the
c
minor
mazurka
op
is
another
of
those
wonderful
heartfelt
melodies
of
the
master
what
can
i
say
of
the
deepening
feeling
at
the
con
anima
it
stabs
with
its
pathos
here
is
the
poet
chopin
the
poet
who
with
burns
interprets
the
simple
strains
of
the
folk
who
blinds
us
with
color
and
rich
romanticism
like
keats
and
lifts
us
to
transcendental
azure
and
his
only
apparatus
a
keyboard
as
schumann
wrote
chopin
did
not
make
his
appearance
by
an
orchestral
army
as
a
great
genius
is
accustomed
to
do
he
only
possesses
a
small
cohort
but
every
soul
belongs
to
him
to
the
last
hero
eight
lines
is
this
dance
yet
its
meanings
are
almost
endless
no
in
b
minor
is
called
the
cuckoo
by
kleczynski
it
is
sprightly
and
with
the
lilt
notwithstanding
its
subtle
progressions
of
mazovia
no
in
d
flat
is
all
animation
brightness
and
a
determination
to
stay
out
the
dance
the
alternate
of
the
theme
is
truly
polish
the
graceful
trio
and
canorous
brilliancy
of
this
dance
make
it
a
favored
number
the
ending
is
epigrammatic
it
comes
so
suddenly
upon
us
our
cortical
cells
pealing
with
the
minor
that
its
very
abruptness
is
witty
one
can
see
chopin
making
a
mocking
moue
as
he
wrote
it
tschaikowsky
borrowed
the
effect
for
the
conclusion
of
the
chinoise
in
a
miniature
orchestral
suite
the
fourth
of
this
opus
is
in
c
sharp
minor
again
i
feel
like
letting
loose
the
dogs
of
enthusiasm
the
sharp
rhythms
and
solid
build
of
this
ample
work
give
it
a
massive
character
it
is
one
of
the
big
mazurkas
and
the
ending
raw
as
it
is
consecutive
fifths
and
sevenths
compasses
its
intended
meaning
opus
is
a
popular
set
it
begins
with
one
in
g
sharp
minor
which
is
curt
and
rather
depressing
the
relief
in
b
major
is
less
real
than
it
seems
on
paper
moody
withal
a
mazurka
no
in
d
is
bustling
graceful
and
full
of
unrestrained
vitality
bright
and
not
particularly
profound
it
was
successfully
arranged
for
voice
by
the
third
of
the
opus
in
c
is
the
one
described
by
de
lenz
as
almost
precipitating
a
violent
row
between
chopin
and
meyerbeer
he
had
christened
it
the
epitaph
of
the
idea
said
meyerbeer
after
de
lenz
played
it
answered
chopin
flushing
angrily
let
me
have
it
for
a
ballet
in
my
new
opera
and
i
show
you
retorted
meyerbeer
it
scolded
chopin
and
played
it
himself
de
lenz
says
they
parted
coolly
each
holding
to
his
opinion
later
in
petersburg
meyerbeer
met
this
gossip
and
told
him
that
he
loved
chopin
i
know
no
pianist
no
composer
for
the
piano
like
him
meyerbeer
was
wrong
in
his
idea
of
the
tempo
though
chopin
slurs
the
last
beat
it
is
there
nevertheless
this
mazurka
is
only
four
lines
long
and
is
charming
as
charming
as
the
brief
specimen
in
the
preludes
the
next
mazurka
is
another
famous
warhorse
in
b
minor
it
is
full
of
veiled
coquetries
hazardous
mood
transitions
growling
recitatives
and
smothered
plaints
the
continual
return
to
the
theme
gives
rise
to
all
manner
of
fanciful
programmes
one
of
the
most
characteristic
is
by
the
polish
poet
zelenski
who
so
kleczynski
relates
wrote
a
humorous
poem
on
this
mazurka
for
him
it
is
a
domestic
comedy
in
which
a
drunken
peasant
and
his
much
abused
wife
enact
a
little
scene
returning
home
the
worse
for
wear
he
sings
oj
ta
dana
oh
dear
me
and
rumbles
in
the
bass
in
a
figure
that
answers
the
treble
his
wife
reproaching
him
he
strikes
her
here
we
are
in
b
flat
she
laments
her
fate
in
b
major
then
her
husband
shouts
be
quiet
old
vixen
this
is
given
in
the
octaves
a
genuine
dialogue
the
wife
tartly
answering
sha
be
quiet
the
gruff
grumbling
in
the
bass
is
heard
an
imitation
of
the
above
when
suddenly
the
man
cries
out
the
last
eight
bars
of
the
composition
kitty
kitty
come
do
come
here
i
forgive
you
which
is
decidedly
masculine
in
its
magnanimity
if
one
does
not
care
for
the
rather
coarse
realism
of
this
reading
kleczynski
offers
the
poem
of
ujejeski
called
the
dragoon
a
soldier
flatters
a
girl
at
the
inn
she
flies
from
him
and
her
lover
believing
she
has
deceived
him
despairingly
drowns
himself
the
ending
with
its
ring
ring
ring
the
bell
there
horses
carry
me
to
the
depths
has
more
poetic
contour
than
the
other
without
grafting
any
libretto
on
it
this
mazurka
is
a
beautiful
in
itself
its
theme
is
delicately
mournful
and
the
subject
in
b
major
simply
entrancing
in
its
broad
flowing
melody
in
c
sharp
minor
op
is
a
mazurka
that
is
beloved
of
me
its
scale
is
exotic
its
rhythm
convincing
its
tune
a
little
saddened
by
life
but
courage
never
fails
this
theme
sounds
persistently
in
the
middle
voices
in
the
bass
and
at
the
close
in
full
harmonies
unisons
giving
it
a
startling
effect
octaves
take
it
up
in
profile
until
it
vanishes
here
is
the
very
apotheosis
of
rhythm
no
in
e
minor
is
not
very
resolute
of
heart
it
was
composed
so
niecks
avers
at
palma
when
chopin
health
fully
accounts
for
the
depressed
character
of
the
piece
for
it
is
sad
to
the
point
of
tears
of
op
he
wrote
to
fontana
from
nohant
in
you
know
i
have
four
new
mazurkas
one
from
palma
in
e
minor
three
from
here
in
b
major
a
flat
major
and
c
sharp
minor
they
seem
to
me
pretty
as
the
youngest
children
usually
do
when
the
parents
grow
old
no
is
a
vigorous
sonorous
dance
no
over
which
the
editors
deviate
on
the
serious
matter
of
text
in
a
flat
is
for
the
concert
room
and
is
allied
to
several
of
his
gracious
valses
playful
and
decorative
but
not
profound
in
feeling
opus
the
first
in
g
major
is
healthy
and
vivacious
good
humor
predominates
kullak
notes
that
in
some
editions
it
closes
pianissimo
which
seems
a
little
out
of
drawing
no
is
charming
in
a
flat
it
is
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
aristocratic
mazurka
the
d
flat
trio
the
answering
episode
in
b
flat
minor
and
the
grace
of
the
return
make
this
one
to
be
studied
and
treasured
de
lenz
finds
influences
in
the
following
in
c
sharp
minor
it
begins
as
though
written
for
the
organ
and
ends
in
an
exclusive
salon
it
does
him
credit
and
is
worked
out
more
fully
than
the
others
chopin
was
much
pleased
when
i
told
him
that
in
the
construction
of
this
mazurka
the
passage
from
e
major
to
f
major
was
the
same
as
that
in
the
agatha
aria
in
de
lenz
refers
to
the
opening
mutations
the
texture
of
this
dance
is
closer
and
finer
spun
than
any
we
have
encountered
perhaps
spontaneity
is
impaired
mais
que
voulez
vous
chopin
was
bound
to
develop
and
his
mazurkas
fragile
and
constricted
as
is
the
form
were
sure
to
show
a
like
record
of
spiritual
and
intellectual
growth
opus
in
b
major
is
elaborate
even
in
its
beginning
there
is
decoration
in
the
ritornelle
in
e
flat
and
one
feels
the
absence
of
a
compensating
emotion
despite
the
display
of
contrapuntal
skill
very
but
not
so
intimate
as
some
of
the
others
karasowski
selects
no
in
c
as
an
illustration
it
is
as
though
the
composer
had
sought
for
the
moment
to
divert
himself
with
narcotic
intoxication
only
to
fall
back
the
more
deeply
into
his
original
gloom
there
is
the
peasant
in
the
first
bars
in
c
but
the
a
minor
and
what
follows
soon
disturb
the
air
of
bonhomie
theoretical
ease
is
in
the
imitative
passages
chopin
is
now
master
of
his
tools
the
third
mazurka
of
op
is
in
c
minor
it
is
quite
long
and
does
not
give
the
impression
of
a
whole
with
the
exception
of
a
short
break
in
b
major
it
is
composed
with
the
head
not
the
heart
nor
yet
the
heels
not
unlike
in
its
sturdy
affirmation
the
one
in
c
sharp
minor
op
is
the
next
mazurka
in
a
minor
op
that
chopin
did
not
repeat
himself
is
an
artistic
miracle
a
subtle
turn
takes
us
off
the
familiar
road
to
some
strange
glade
wherein
the
flowers
are
rare
in
scent
and
odor
this
mazurka
like
the
one
that
follows
has
a
dim
resemblance
to
others
yet
there
is
always
a
novel
point
of
departure
a
fresh
harmony
a
sudden
melody
or
an
unexpected
ending
hadow
for
example
thinks
the
a
flat
of
this
opus
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
in
it
he
finds
legitimately
used
the
repetition
in
various
shapes
of
a
single
phrase
to
me
this
mazurka
seems
but
an
amplification
an
elaboration
of
the
lovely
one
in
the
same
key
op
no
the
double
sixths
and
more
complicated
phraseology
do
not
render
the
later
superior
to
the
early
mazurka
yet
there
is
no
gainsaying
the
fact
that
this
is
a
noble
composition
but
the
next
in
f
sharp
minor
despite
its
rather
saturnine
gaze
is
stronger
in
interest
if
not
in
workmanship
while
it
lacks
niecks
beautes
sauvages
is
it
not
far
loftier
in
conception
and
execution
than
op
in
f
sharp
minor
the
inevitable
triplet
appears
in
the
third
bar
and
is
a
hero
throughout
oh
here
is
charm
for
you
read
the
close
of
the
section
in
f
sharp
major
in
the
major
it
ends
the
triplet
fading
away
at
last
a
mere
shadow
a
turn
on
d
sharp
but
victor
to
the
last
chopin
is
at
the
summit
of
his
invention
time
and
tune
that
wait
for
no
man
are
now
his
bond
slaves
pathos
delicacy
boldness
a
measured
melancholy
and
the
art
of
euphonious
presentiment
of
all
these
and
many
factors
more
stamp
this
mazurka
a
masterpiece
niecks
believes
there
is
a
return
of
the
early
freshness
and
poetry
in
the
last
three
mazurkas
op
they
are
indeed
teeming
with
interesting
matter
he
writes
looked
at
from
the
musician
point
of
view
how
much
do
we
not
see
novel
and
strange
beautiful
and
fascinating
withal
sharp
dissonances
chromatic
passing
notes
suspensions
and
anticipations
displacement
of
accent
progressions
of
perfect
fifths
the
horror
of
schoolmen
sudden
turns
and
unexpected
digressions
that
are
so
unaccountable
so
out
of
the
line
of
logical
sequence
that
one
following
the
composer
is
beset
with
difficulties
but
all
this
is
a
means
to
an
end
the
expression
of
an
individuality
with
its
intimate
experiences
the
emotional
content
of
many
of
these
trifles
trifles
if
considered
only
by
their
size
is
really
stupendous
spoken
like
a
brave
man
and
not
a
pedant
full
of
vitality
is
the
first
number
of
op
in
b
major
it
is
sufficiently
various
in
figuration
and
rhythmical
life
to
single
it
from
its
fellows
the
next
in
f
minor
has
a
more
elegiac
ring
brief
and
not
difficult
of
matter
or
manner
is
this
dance
the
third
of
winning
beauty
is
in
c
sharp
minor
surely
a
pendant
to
the
c
sharp
minor
valse
i
defy
anyone
to
withstand
the
pleading
eloquent
voice
of
this
mazurka
slender
in
technical
configuration
yet
it
impressed
louis
ehlert
so
much
that
he
was
impelled
to
write
a
more
perfect
canon
in
the
octave
could
not
have
been
written
by
one
who
had
grown
gray
in
the
learned
arts
the
four
mazurkas
published
posthumously
in
that
comprise
op
were
composed
by
chopin
at
various
dates
to
the
first
in
g
klindworth
affixes
as
the
year
of
composition
niecks
gives
a
much
earlier
date
i
fancy
the
latter
is
correct
as
the
piece
sounds
like
one
of
chopin
more
youthful
efforts
it
is
jolly
and
rather
superficial
the
next
in
g
minor
is
familiar
it
is
very
pretty
and
its
date
is
set
down
by
niecks
as
while
klindworth
gives
here
again
niecks
is
correct
although
i
suspect
that
klindworth
transposed
his
figures
accidentally
no
in
c
was
composed
in
on
this
both
biographer
and
editor
agree
it
is
certainly
an
early
effusion
of
no
great
value
although
a
good
dancing
tune
no
a
minor
of
this
opus
composed
in
is
more
mature
but
in
no
wise
remarkable
opus
the
second
of
the
fontana
set
was
composed
in
the
first
in
c
is
commonplace
the
one
in
a
minor
composed
in
is
much
better
being
lighter
and
well
made
the
third
in
f
major
weak
and
trivial
and
the
fourth
in
f
minor
interesting
because
it
is
said
by
julius
fontana
to
be
chopin
last
composition
he
put
it
on
paper
a
short
time
before
his
death
but
was
too
ill
to
try
it
at
the
piano
it
is
certainly
morbid
in
its
sick
insistence
in
phrase
repetition
close
harmonies
and
wild
departure
in
a
from
the
first
figure
but
it
completes
the
gloomy
and
sardonic
loop
and
we
wish
after
playing
this
veritable
song
of
the
tomb
that
we
had
parted
from
chopin
in
health
not
disease
this
page
is
full
of
the
premonitions
of
decay
too
weak
and
faltering
to
be
febrile
chopin
is
here
a
debile
prematurely
exhausted
young
man
there
are
a
few
accents
of
a
forced
gayety
but
they
are
swallowed
up
in
the
mists
of
dissolution
the
dissolution
of
one
of
the
most
sensitive
brains
ever
wrought
by
nature
here
we
may
echo
without
any
savor
of
liszt
condescension
or
de
lenz
irony
pauvre
frederic
klindworth
and
kullak
have
different
ideas
concerning
the
end
of
this
mazurka
both
are
correct
kullak
klindworth
and
mikuli
include
in
their
editions
two
mazurkas
in
a
minor
neither
is
impressive
one
the
date
of
composition
unknown
is
dedicated
a
son
ami
emile
gaillard
the
other
first
appeared
in
a
musical
publication
of
schotts
about
or
according
to
niecks
of
this
set
i
prefer
the
former
it
abounds
in
octaves
and
ends
with
a
long
trill
there
is
in
the
klindworth
edition
a
mazurka
the
last
in
the
set
in
the
key
of
f
sharp
it
is
so
and
artificial
that
the
doubts
of
the
pianist
ernst
pauer
were
aroused
as
to
its
authenticity
on
inquiry
niecks
quotes
from
the
london
monthly
musical
record
july
pauer
discovered
that
the
piece
was
identical
with
a
mazurka
by
charles
mayer
gotthard
being
the
publisher
of
the
alleged
chopin
mazurka
declared
he
bought
the
manuscript
from
a
polish
countess
possibly
one
of
the
fifty
in
whose
arms
chopin
died
and
that
the
lady
parted
with
chopin
autograph
because
of
her
dire
poverty
it
is
of
course
a
clear
case
of
forgery
of
the
four
early
mazurkas
in
g
major
and
b
flat
major
dating
from
d
major
composed
in
but
remodelled
in
and
c
major
of
the
latter
is
the
most
characteristic
the
g
major
is
of
slight
worth
as
niecks
remarks
it
contains
a
harmonic
error
the
one
in
b
flat
starts
out
with
a
phrase
that
recalls
the
a
minor
mazurka
numbered
in
the
breitkopf
hartel
edition
this
b
flat
mazurka
early
as
it
was
composed
is
nevertheless
pretty
there
are
breadth
and
decision
in
the
c
major
mazurka
the
recasting
improves
the
d
major
mazurka
its
trio
is
lifted
an
octave
and
the
doubling
of
notes
throughout
gives
more
weight
and
richness
in
the
minor
key
laughs
and
cries
dances
and
mourns
the
slav
says
schucht
in
his
monograph
on
chopin
chopin
here
reveals
not
only
his
nationality
but
his
own
fascinating
and
enigmatic
individuality
within
the
tremulous
spaces
of
this
immature
dance
is
enacted
the
play
of
a
human
soul
a
soul
that
voices
the
sorrow
and
revolt
of
a
dying
race
of
a
dying
poet
they
are
epigrammatic
fluctuating
crazy
and
tender
these
mazurkas
and
some
of
them
have
a
soft
melancholy
light
as
if
shining
through
alabaster
true
corpse
light
leading
to
a
morass
of
doubt
and
terror
but
a
fantastic
dishevelled
debonair
spirit
is
the
guide
and
to
him
we
abandon
ourselves
in
these
precise
and
vertiginous
dances
xiv
chopin
the
conqueror
the
scherzi
of
chopin
are
of
his
own
creation
the
type
as
illustrated
by
beethoven
and
mendelssohn
had
no
meaning
for
him
whether
in
earnest
or
serious
jest
chopin
pitched
on
a
title
that
is
widely
misleading
when
the
content
is
considered
the
beethoven
scherzo
is
full
of
a
robust
sort
of
humor
in
it
he
is
seldom
poetical
frequently
given
to
gossip
and
at
times
he
hints
at
the
mystery
of
life
the
demoniacal
element
the
fierce
jollity
that
mocks
itself
the
almost
titanic
anger
of
chopin
would
not
have
been
regarded
by
the
composer
of
the
eroica
symphony
as
adapted
to
the
form
the
pole
practically
built
up
a
new
musical
structure
boldly
called
it
a
scherzo
and
as
in
the
case
of
the
ballades
poured
into
its
elastic
mould
most
disturbing
and
incomparable
music
chopin
seldom
compasses
sublimity
his
arrows
are
tipped
with
fire
yet
they
do
not
fly
far
but
in
some
of
his
music
he
skirts
the
regions
where
abide
the
gods
in
at
least
one
scherzo
in
one
ballade
in
the
f
minor
fantaisie
in
the
first
two
movements
of
the
b
flat
minor
sonata
in
several
of
the
eludes
and
in
one
of
the
preludes
he
compasses
grandeur
individuality
of
utterance
beauty
of
utterance
and
the
eloquence
we
call
divine
are
his
criticism
then
bows
its
questioning
brows
before
this
anointed
one
in
the
scherzi
chopin
is
often
prophet
as
well
as
poet
he
fumes
and
frets
but
upon
his
countenance
is
the
precious
fury
of
the
sibyls
we
see
the
soul
that
suffers
from
secret
convulsions
but
forgive
the
writhing
for
the
music
made
these
four
scherzi
are
psychical
records
confessions
committed
to
paper
of
outpourings
that
never
could
have
passed
the
lips
from
these
alone
we
may
almost
reconstruct
the
real
chopin
the
inner
chopin
whose
conventional
exterior
so
ill
prepared
the
world
for
the
tragic
issues
of
his
music
the
first
scherzo
is
a
fair
model
there
are
a
few
bars
of
introduction
the
porch
as
niecks
would
call
it
a
principal
subject
a
trio
a
short
section
a
skilful
return
to
the
opening
theme
and
an
elaborate
coda
this
edifice
not
architecturally
flawless
is
better
adapted
to
the
florid
beauties
of
byzantine
treatment
than
to
the
severe
hellenic
line
yet
chopin
gave
it
dignity
largeness
and
a
classic
massiveness
the
interior
is
romantic
is
modern
personal
but
the
facade
shows
gleaming
minarets
the
strangely
builded
shapes
of
the
orient
this
b
minor
scherzo
has
the
acid
note
of
sorrow
and
revolt
yet
the
complex
figuration
never
wavers
the
walls
stand
firm
despite
the
hurricane
blowing
through
and
around
them
ehlert
finds
this
scherzo
tornadic
it
is
gusty
and
the
hurry
and
do
not
endear
it
to
the
pianist
the
first
pages
are
filled
with
wrathful
sounds
there
is
much
tossing
of
hands
and
cries
to
heaven
calling
down
its
fire
and
brimstone
a
climax
mounts
to
a
fine
frenzy
until
the
lyric
intermezzo
in
b
is
reached
here
love
chants
with
honeyed
tongues
the
widely
dispersed
figure
of
the
melody
has
an
entrancing
tenderness
but
peace
does
not
long
prevail
against
the
powers
of
eblis
and
infernal
is
the
wilde
jagd
of
the
finale
after
shrillest
of
dissonances
a
chromatic
uproar
pilots
the
doomed
one
across
this
desperate
styx
what
chopin
programme
was
we
can
but
guess
he
may
have
outlined
the
composition
in
a
moment
of
great
ebullition
a
time
of
soul
laceration
arising
from
a
cat
scratch
or
a
quarrel
with
maurice
sand
in
the
garden
over
the
possession
of
the
goat
cart
the
klindworth
edition
is
preferable
kullak
follows
his
example
in
using
the
double
note
stems
in
the
b
major
part
he
gives
the
a
sharp
in
the
bass
six
bars
before
the
return
of
the
first
motif
klindworth
and
other
editions
prescribe
a
natural
which
is
not
so
effective
this
scherzo
might
profit
by
being
played
without
the
repeats
the
chromatic
interlocked
octaves
at
the
close
are
very
striking
i
find
at
times
as
my
mood
changes
something
almost
repellant
in
the
b
minor
scherzo
it
does
not
present
the
frank
physiognomy
of
the
second
scherzo
op
in
b
flat
minor
ehlert
cries
that
it
was
composed
in
a
blessed
hour
although
de
lenz
quotes
chopin
as
saying
of
the
opening
it
must
be
a
charnel
house
the
defiant
challenge
of
the
beginning
has
no
savor
of
the
scorn
and
drastic
mockery
of
its
we
are
conscious
that
tragedy
impends
that
after
the
prologue
may
follow
fast
catastrophe
yet
it
is
not
feared
with
all
the
portentous
thunder
of
its
index
nor
are
we
deceived
a
melody
of
winning
distinction
unrolls
before
us
it
has
a
noble
tone
is
of
a
noble
type
without
relaxing
pace
it
passes
and
drops
like
a
thunderbolt
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
again
the
story
is
told
and
tarrying
not
at
all
we
are
led
to
a
most
delectable
spot
in
the
key
of
a
major
this
trio
is
marked
by
genius
can
anything
be
more
bewitching
than
the
episode
in
c
sharp
minor
merging
into
e
major
with
the
overflow
at
the
close
the
fantasy
is
notable
for
variety
of
tonality
freedom
in
rhythmical
incidents
and
genuine
power
the
coda
is
dizzy
and
overwhelming
for
schumann
this
scherzo
is
byronic
in
tenderness
and
boldness
karasowski
speaks
of
its
shakespearian
humor
and
indeed
it
is
a
very
human
and
lovable
piece
of
art
it
holds
richer
warmer
redder
blood
than
the
other
three
and
like
the
a
flat
ballade
is
beloved
of
the
public
but
then
it
is
easier
to
understand
opus
the
third
scherzo
in
c
sharp
minor
was
composed
or
finished
at
majorca
and
is
the
most
dramatic
of
the
set
i
confess
to
see
no
littleness
in
the
polished
phrases
though
irony
lurks
in
its
bars
and
there
is
fever
in
its
glance
a
glance
full
of
enigmatic
and
luring
scorn
i
heartily
agree
with
hadow
who
finds
the
work
clear
cut
and
of
exact
balance
and
noting
that
chopin
founded
whole
paragraphs
either
on
a
single
phrase
repeated
in
similar
shapes
or
on
two
phrases
in
alternation
a
primitive
practice
in
polish
folksongs
he
asserts
that
beethoven
does
not
attain
the
lucidity
of
his
style
by
such
parallelism
of
phraseology
but
admits
that
chopin
methods
made
for
clearness
and
precision
may
be
regarded
as
characteristic
of
the
national
manner
a
thoroughly
personal
characteristic
too
there
is
virile
clangor
in
the
firmly
struck
octaves
of
the
opening
pages
no
hesitating
morbid
view
of
life
but
rank
harsh
assertiveness
not
untinged
with
splenetic
anger
the
chorale
of
the
trio
is
admirably
devised
and
carried
out
its
piety
is
a
bit
of
liturgical
the
contrasts
here
are
most
artistic
sonorous
harmonies
set
off
by
broken
chords
that
deliciously
tinkle
there
is
a
coda
of
frenetic
movement
and
the
end
is
in
major
a
surprising
conclusion
when
considering
all
that
has
gone
before
never
to
become
the
property
of
the
profane
the
c
sharp
minor
scherzo
notwithstanding
its
marked
asperities
and
agitated
moments
is
a
great
work
of
art
without
the
inner
freedom
of
its
predecessor
it
is
more
sober
and
than
the
b
minor
scherzo
the
fourth
scherzo
op
is
in
the
key
of
built
up
by
a
series
of
cunning
touches
and
climaxes
and
without
the
mood
depth
or
variety
of
its
brethren
it
is
more
truly
a
scherzo
than
any
of
them
it
has
tripping
lightness
and
there
is
sunshine
imprisoned
behind
its
open
bars
of
it
schumann
could
not
ask
how
is
gravity
to
clothe
itself
if
jest
goes
about
in
dark
veils
here
then
is
intellectual
refinement
and
jesting
of
a
superior
sort
niecks
thinks
it
fragmentary
i
find
the
measures
delightful
after
the
doleful
mutterings
of
some
of
the
other
scherzi
there
is
the
same
spirit
of
opposition
but
of
arrogance
none
the
c
sharp
minor
theme
is
of
lyric
beauty
the
coda
with
its
scales
brilliant
it
seems
to
be
banned
by
classicists
and
chopin
worshippers
alike
the
agnostic
attitude
is
not
yet
dead

world
rubinstein
most
admired
the
first
two
scherzi
the
b
minor
has
been
criticised
for
being
too
much
in
the
etude
vein
but
with
all
their
shortcomings
these
compositions
are
without
peer
in
the
literature
of
the
piano
they
were
published
and
dedicated
as
follows
op
february
to
albrecht
op
december
comtesse
de
furstenstein
op
october
adolph
gutmann
and
op
december
mile
de
caraman
de
lenz
relates
that
chopin
dedicated
the
c
sharp
minor
scherzo
to
his
pupil
gutmann
because
this
giant
with
a
prize
fighter
fist
could
knock
a
hole
in
the
table
with
a
certain
chord
for
the
left
hand
sixth
measure
from
the
beginning
and
adds
quite
naively
nothing
more
was
ever
heard
of
this
gutmann
he
was
a
discovery
of
chopin
chopin
died
in
this
same
gutmann
arms
and
despite
de
lenz
gutmann
was
in
evidence
until
his
death
as
a
favorite
pupil
and
now
we
have
reached
the
grandest
oh
banal
and
abused
word
of
chopin
compositions
the
fantaisie
in
f
minor
op
robert
schumann
after
remarking
that
the
cosmopolitan
must
sacrifice
the
small
interests
of
the
soil
on
which
he
was
born
notices
that
chopin
later
works
begin
to
lose
something
of
their
especial
sarmatian
physiognomy
to
approach
partly
more
nearly
the
universal
ideal
cultivated
by
the
divine
greeks
which
we
find
again
in
mozart
the
f
minor
fantaisie
has
hardly
the
mozartian
serenity
but
parades
a
formal
beauty
not
disfigured
by
an
excess
of
violence
either
personal
or
patriotic
and
its
melodies
if
restless
by
melancholy
are
of
surprising
nobility
and
dramatic
grandeur
without
including
the
beethoven
sonatas
not
strictly
born
of
the
instrument
i
do
not
fear
to
maintain
that
this
fantaisie
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
piano
pieces
never
properly
appreciated
by
pianists
critics
or
public
it
is
after
more
than
a
half
century
of
neglect
being
understood
at
last
it
was
published
november
and
probably
composed
at
nohant
as
a
letter
of
the
composer
indicates
the
dedication
is
to
princesse
de
souzzo
these
interminable
countesses
and
princesses
of
chopin
for
niecks
who
could
not
at
first
discern
its
worth
it
suggests
a
titan
in
commotion
it
is
titanic
the
torso
of
some
dream
it
is
chopin
faust
a
macabre
march
containing
some
dangerous
dissonances
gravely
ushers
us
to
ascending
staircases
of
triplets
only
to
precipitate
us
to
the
very
abysses
of
the
piano
that
first
subject
is
it
not
almost
as
ethically
puissant
and
passionate
as
beethoven
in
his
f
minor
sonata
chopin
lack
of
tenaciousness
is
visible
here
beethoven
would
have
built
a
cathedral
on
such
a
foundational
scheme
but
chopin
ever
prodigal
in
his
melody
making
dashes
impetuously
to
the
a
flat
episode
that
heroic
love
chant
erroneously
marked
dolce
and
played
with
the
effeminacies
of
a
salon
three
times
does
it
resound
in
this
strange
hall
of
glancing
mirrors
yet
not
once
should
it
be
caressed
the
bronze
fingers
of
a
tausig
are
needed
now
are
arching
the
triplets
to
the
great
thrilling
song
beginning
in
c
minor
and
then
the
octaves
in
contrary
motion
split
wide
asunder
the
very
earth
after
terrific
chordal
reverberations
there
is
the
rapid
retreat
of
vague
armies
and
once
again
is
begun
the
ascent
of
the
rolling
triplets
to
inaccessible
heights
and
the
first
theme
sounds
in
c
minor
the
modulation
lifts
to
g
flat
only
to
drop
to
abysmal
depths
what
mighty
desperate
cause
is
being
espoused
when
peace
is
presaged
in
the
key
of
b
is
this
the
prize
for
which
strive
these
agonized
hosts
is
some
forlorn
princess
locked
behind
these
solemn
inaccessible
bars
for
a
few
moments
there
is
contentment
beyond
all
price
then
the
warring
tribe
of
triplets
recommence
after
clamorous
g
flat
octaves
reeling
from
the
stars
to
the
sea
of
the
first
theme
another
rush
into
d
flat
ensues
the
song
of
c
minor
reappears
in
f
minor
and
the
miracle
is
repeated
oracular
octaves
quake
the
cellarage
of
the
palace
the
warriors
hurry
by
their
measured
tramp
is
audible
after
they
vanish
and
the
triplets
obscure
their
retreat
with
chromatic
vapors
then
an
adagio
in
this
fantastic
old
world
tale
the
curtain
prepares
to
descend
a
faint
sweet
voice
sings
a
short
appealing
cadenza
and
after
billowing
a
flat
arpeggios
soft
great
hummocks
of
tone
two
giant
chords
are
sounded
and
the
ballade
of
love

war
is
over
who
conquers
is
the
lady
with
the
green
eyes
and

white
face

or
is
all
this
a
de

dream
fugue
translated
into
tone
a
sonorous
awesome
vision
like
de
quincey
it
suggests
the
apparition
of
the
empire
of
fear
the
fear
that
is
secretly
felt
with
dreams
wherein
the
spirit
expands
to
the
drummings
of
infinite

for
the

franz
liszt
told
vladimir
de
pachmann
the
programme
of
the
fantaisie
as
related
to
him
by
chopin
at
the
close
of
one
desperate
immemorial
day
the
pianist
was
crooning
at
the
piano
his
spirits
vastly
depressed
suddenly
came
a
knocking
at
his
door
a
sinister
tapping
which
he
at
once
rhythmically
echoed
upon
the
keyboard
his
centre
being
unusually
sensitive
the
first
two
bars

these

stand
for
chopin
musical
invitation
entrez
entrez
this
is
all
repeated
until
the
doors
wide
open
swinging
admit
liszt
george
sand
madame
camille
pleyel
nee
mock
and
others
to
the
solemn
measures
of
the
march
they
enter
and
range
themselves
about
chopin
who
after
the
agitated
triplets
begins
his
complaint
in
the
mysterious
song
in
f
minor
but
sand
with
whom
he
has
quarrelled
falls
before
him
on
her
knees
and
pleads
for
pardon
straightway
the
chant
merges
into
the
appealing
a
flat
section
this
sends
skyward
my
theory
of
its
interpretation
and
from
c
minor
the
current
becomes
more
tempestuous
until
the
climax
is
reached
and
to
the
second
march
the
intruders
rapidly
vanish
the
remainder
of
the
work
with
the
exception
of
the
lento
sostenuto
in
b
where
it
is
to
be
hoped
chopin
perturbed
soul
finds
momentary
peace
is
largely
repetition
and
development
this
far
from
ideal
reading
is
an
authoritative
one
coming
as
it
does
from
chopin
by
way
of
liszt
i
console
myself
for
its
rather
commonplace
character
with
the
notion
that
perhaps
in
the
the
story
has
caught
some
personal
cadenzas
of
the
two
historians
in
any
case
i
shall
cling
to
my
own
version
the
f
minor
fantaisie
will
mean
many
things
to
many
people
chopin
has
never
before
maintained
so
artistically
so
free
from
delirium
such
a
level
of
strong
passion
mental
power
and
exalted
euphony
it
is
his
largest
canvas
and
though
there
are
no
periods
such
as
in
the
b
flat
minor
scherzo
the
phraseology
is
amply
broad
without
padding
of
paragraphs
the
rapt
interest
is
not
relaxed
until
the
final
bar
this
transcendental
work
more
nearly
approaches
beethoven
in
its
unity
its
formal
rectitude
and
its
brave
economy
of
thematic
material
while
few
men
have
dared
to
unlock
their
hearts
thus
chopin
is
not
so
intimate
here
as
in
the
mazurkas
but
the
pulse
beats
ardently
in
the
tissues
of
this
composition
as
art
for
art
it
is
less
perfect
the
gain
is
on
the
human
side
nearing
his
end
chopin
discerned
with
ever
widening
ever
brighter
vision
the
great
heart
throb
of
the
universe
master
of
his
material
if
not
of
his
mortal
tenement
he
passionately
strove
to
shape
his
dreams
into
abiding
sounds
he
did
not
always
succeed
but
his
victories
are
the
precious
prizes
of
mankind
one
is
loath
to
believe
that
the
echo
of
chopin
magic
music
can
ever
fall
upon
unheeding
ears
he
may
become
but
like
mozart
he
will
remain
eternally

of
james
huneker
do
you
know
that
is
the
only
book
of
high
and
universal
critical
worth
that
we
have
had
for
years

be
precise

the

of

of
huneker
the
new
cosmopolis
the
region
of
bohemia
james
huneker
found
long
ago
is
within
us
at
twenty
he
says
he
discovered
that
there
is
no
such
enchanted
spot
as
the
latin
quarter
but
that
every
generation
sets
back
the
mythical
land
into
the
golden
age
of
the
commune
or
of
or
the
days
of
it
is
the
same
with
new
york
east
side
fabulous
east
side
as
huneker
calls
it
in
his
collection
of
international
urban
studies
new
cosmopolis
if
one
judged
externals
by
grime
by
poverty
by
sanded
with
visionaries
assailing
the
social
order
then
the
east
side
of
the
early
eighties
has
gone
down
before
the
mad
rush
of
settlement
workers
impertinent
reformers
sociological
cranks
politicians
billionaire
socialists
and
the
reporters
the
sentimental
traveller
a
to
see
the
order
the
cleanliness
the
wide
streets
the
playgrounds
the
big
boulevards
the
absence
of
indigence
that
have
spoiled
the
most
interesting
part
of
new
york
city
but
apparently
this
is
only
a
first
impression
for
huneker
had
no
trouble
in
discovering
in
one
cafe
a
patriarchal
figure
quite
of
the
type
beloved
of
the
hunters
of
twenty
years
ago
a
prophet
though
speaking
a
modern
language
and
concerned
with
things
of
the
day
so
that
we
owe
to
huneker
the
discovery
of
a
notable
truth
namely
that
bohemia
is
not
only
a
creation
of
the
sentimental
memory
but
being
psychological
may
be
located
in
clean
and
prosperous
quarters
the
tendency
has
always
been
to
place
it
in
a
golden
age
but
a
tattered
and
unswept
age
