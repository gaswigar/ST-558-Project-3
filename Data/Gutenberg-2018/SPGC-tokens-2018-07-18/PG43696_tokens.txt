the
story
of
mary
maclane
butte
montana
january
i
of
womankind
and
of
nineteen
years
will
now
begin
to
set
down
as
full
and
frank
a
portrayal
as
i
am
able
of
myself
mary
maclane
for
whom
the
world
contains
not
a
parallel
i
am
convinced
of
this
for
i
am
odd
i
am
distinctly
original
innately
and
in
development
i
have
in
me
a
quite
unusual
intensity
of
life
i
can
feel
i
have
a
marvelous
capacity
for
misery
and
for
happiness
i
am
i
am
a
genius
i
am
a
philosopher
of
my
own
good
peripatetic
school
i
care
neither
for
right
nor
for
wrong
my
conscience
is
nil
my
brain
is
a
conglomeration
of
aggressive
versatility
i
have
reached
a
truly
wonderful
state
of
miserable
morbid
unhappiness
i
know
myself
oh
very
well
i
have
attained
an
egotism
that
is
rare
indeed
i
have
gone
into
the
deep
shadows
all
this
constitutes
oddity
i
find
therefore
that
i
am
quite
quite
odd
i
have
hunted
for
even
the
suggestion
of
a
parallel
among
the
several
hundred
persons
that
i
call
acquaintances
but
in
vain
there
are
people
and
people
of
varying
depths
and
intricacies
of
character
but
there
is
none
to
compare
with
me
the
young
ones
of
my
own
age
if
i
chance
to
give
them
but
a
glimpse
of
the
real
workings
of
my
mind
can
only
stare
at
me
in
dazed
stupidity
uncomprehending
and
the
old
ones
of
forty
and
fifty
for
forty
and
fifty
are
always
old
to
nineteen
can
but
either
stare
also
in
stupidity
or
else
their
own
narrowness
asserting
itself
smile
their
little
devilish
smile
of
superiority
which
they
reserve
indiscriminately
for
all
foolish
young
things
the
utter
idiocy
of
forty
and
fifty
at
times
these
to
be
sure
are
extreme
instances
there
are
among
my
young
acquaintances
some
who
do
not
stare
in
stupidity
and
yes
even
at
forty
and
fifty
there
are
some
who
understand
some
phases
of
my
complicated
character
though
none
to
comprehend
it
in
its
entirety
but
as
i
said
even
the
suggestion
of
a
parallel
is
not
to
be
found
among
them
i
think
at
this
moment
however
of
two
minds
famous
in
the
world
of
letters
between
which
and
mine
there
are
certain
fine
points
of
similarity
these
are
the
minds
of
lord
byron
and
of
marie
bashkirtseff
it
is
the
byron
of
don
juan
in
whom
i
find
suggestions
of
myself
in
this
sublime
outpouring
there
are
few
to
admire
the
character
of
don
juan
but
all
must
admire
byron
he
is
truly
admirable
he
uncovered
and
exposed
his
soul
of
mingled
good
and
bad
as
the
terms
are
for
the
world
to
gaze
upon
he
knew
the
human
race
and
he
knew
himself
as
for
that
strange
notable
marie
bashkirtseff
yes
i
am
rather
like
her
in
many
points
as
i
ve
been
told
but
in
most
things
i
go
beyond
her
where
she
is
deep
i
am
deeper
where
she
is
wonderful
in
her
intensity
i
am
still
more
wonderful
in
my
intensity
where
she
had
philosophy
i
am
a
philosopher
where
she
had
astonishing
vanity
and
conceit
i
have
yet
more
astonishing
vanity
and
conceit
but
she
forsooth
could
paint
good
pictures
and
i
what
can
i
do
she
had
a
beautiful
face
and
i
am
a
insignificant
little
animal
she
was
surrounded
by
admiring
sympathetic
friends
and
i
am
alone
alone
though
there
are
people
and
people
she
was
a
genius
and
still
more
am
i
a
genius
she
suffered
with
the
pain
of
a
woman
young
and
i
suffer
with
the
pain
of
a
woman
young
and
all
alone
and
so
it
is
along
some
lines
i
have
gotten
to
the
edge
of
the
world
a
step
more
and
i
fall
off
i
do
not
take
the
step
i
stand
on
the
edge
and
i
suffer
nothing
oh
nothing
on
the
earth
can
suffer
like
a
woman
young
and
all
alone
before
proceeding
farther
with
the
portraying
of
mary
maclane
i
will
write
out
some
of
her
uninteresting
history
i
was
born
in
at
winnepeg
in
canada
whether
winnepeg
will
yet
live
to
be
proud
of
this
fact
is
a
matter
for
some
conjecture
and
anxiety
on
my
part
when
i
was
four
years
old
i
was
taken
with
my
family
to
a
little
town
in
western
minnesota
where
i
lived
a
more
or
less
vapid
and
lonely
life
until
i
was
ten
we
came
then
to
montana
whereat
the
aforesaid
life
was
continued
my
father
died
when
i
was
eight
apart
from
feeding
and
clothing
me
comfortably
and
sending
me
to
school
which
is
no
more
than
was
due
me
and
transmitting
to
me
the
maclane
blood
and
character
i
can
not
see
that
he
ever
gave
me
a
single
thought
certainly
he
did
not
love
me
for
he
was
quite
incapable
of
loving
any
one
but
himself
and
since
nothing
is
of
any
moment
in
this
world
without
the
love
of
human
beings
for
each
other
it
is
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
me
whether
my
father
jim
maclane
of
selfish
memory
lived
or
died
he
is
nothing
to
me
there
are
with
me
still
a
mother
a
sister
and
two
brothers
they
also
are
nothing
to
me
they
do
not
understand
me
any
more
than
if
i
were
some
strange
live
curiosity
as
which
i
dare
say
they
regard
me
i
am
peculiarly
of
the
maclane
blood
which
is
highland
scotch
my
sister
and
brothers
inherit
the
traits
of
their
mother
s
family
which
is
of
scotch
lowland
descent
this
alone
makes
no
small
degree
of
difference
apart
from
this
the
maclanes
these
particular
maclanes
are
just
a
little
bit
different
from
every
family
in
canada
and
from
every
other
that
i
ve
known
it
contains
and
has
contained
fanatics
of
many
minds
religious
social
whatnot
and
i
am
a
true
maclane
there
is
absolutely
no
sympathy
between
my
immediate
family
and
me
there
can
never
be
my
mother
having
been
with
me
during
the
whole
of
my
nineteen
years
has
an
utterly
distorted
idea
of
my
nature
and
its
desires
if
indeed
she
has
any
idea
of
it
when
i
think
of
the
exquisite
love
and
sympathy
which
might
be
between
a
mother
and
daughter
i
feel
myself
defrauded
of
a
beautiful
thing
rightfully
mine
in
a
world
where
for
me
such
things
are
pitiably
few
it
will
always
be
so
my
sister
and
brothers
are
not
interested
in
me
and
my
analyses
and
philosophy
and
my
wants
their
own
are
strictly
practical
and
material
the
love
and
sympathy
between
human
beings
is
to
them
it
seems
a
thing
only
for
people
in
books
in
short
they
are
lowland
scotch
and
i
am
a
maclane
and
so
as
i
ve
said
i
carried
my
uninteresting
existence
into
montana
the
existence
became
less
uninteresting
however
as
my
versatile
mind
began
to
develop
and
grow
and
know
the
glittering
things
that
are
but
i
realized
as
the
years
were
passing
that
my
own
life
was
at
best
a
vapid
negative
thing
a
thousand
treasures
that
i
wanted
were
lacking
i
graduated
from
the
high
school
with
these
things
very
good
latin
good
french
and
greek
indifferent
geometry
and
other
mathematics
a
broad
conception
of
history
and
literature
peripatetic
philosophy
that
i
acquired
without
any
aid
from
the
high
school
genius
of
a
kind
that
has
always
been
with
me
an
empty
heart
that
has
taken
on
a
certain
wooden
quality
an
excellent
strong
young
woman
a
pitiably
starved
soul
with
this
equipment
i
have
gone
my
way
through
the
last
two
years
but
my
life
though
unsatisfying
and
warped
is
no
longer
insipid
it
is
fraught
with
a
poignant
misery
the
misery
of
nothingness
i
have
no
particular
thing
to
occupy
me
i
write
every
day
writing
is
a
necessity
like
eating
i
do
a
little
housework
and
on
the
whole
i
am
rather
fond
of
it
some
parts
of
it
i
dislike
dusting
chairs
but
i
have
no
aversion
to
scrubbing
floors
indeed
i
have
gained
much
of
my
strength
and
gracefulness
of
body
from
scrubbing
the
kitchen
floor
to
say
nothing
of
some
fine
points
of
philosophy
it
brings
a
certain
energy
to
one
s
body
and
to
one
s
brain
but
mostly
i
take
walks
far
away
in
the
open
country
butte
and
its
immediate
vicinity
present
as
ugly
an
outlook
as
one
could
wish
to
see
it
is
so
ugly
indeed
that
it
is
near
the
perfection
of
ugliness
and
anything
perfect
or
nearly
so
is
not
to
be
despised
i
have
reached
some
astonishing
subtleties
of
conception
as
i
have
walked
for
miles
over
the
sand
and
barrenness
among
the
little
hills
and
gulches
their
utter
desolateness
is
an
inspiration
to
the
long
long
thoughts
and
to
the
nameless
wanting
every
day
i
walk
over
the
sand
and
barrenness
and
so
then
my
daily
life
seems
an
ordinary
life
enough
and
possibly
to
an
ordinary
person
a
comfortable
life
that
s
as
may
be
to
me
it
is
an
empty
damned
weariness
i
rise
in
the
morning
eat
three
meals
and
walk
and
work
a
little
read
a
little
write
see
some
uninteresting
people
go
to
bed
next
day
i
rise
in
the
morning
eat
three
meals
and
walk
and
work
a
little
read
a
little
write
see
some
uninteresting
people
go
to
bed
again
i
rise
in
the
morning
eat
three
meals
and
walk
and
work
a
little
read
a
little
write
see
some
uninteresting
people
go
to
bed
truly
an
exalted
soulful
life
what
it
does
for
me
how
it
affects
me
i
am
now
trying
to
portray
january
i
have
in
me
the
germs
of
intense
life
if
i
could
and
if
i
could
succeed
in
writing
out
my
living
the
world
itself
would
feel
the
heavy
intensity
of
it
i
have
the
personality
the
nature
of
a
napoleon
albeit
a
feminine
translation
and
therefore
i
do
not
conquer
i
do
not
even
fight
i
manage
only
to
exist
poor
little
mary
maclane
what
might
you
not
be
what
wonderful
things
might
you
not
do
but
held
down
a
seed
fallen
in
barren
ground
alone
uncomprehended
obscure
poor
little
mary
maclane
weep
world
why
don
t
you
for
poor
little
mary
maclane
had
i
been
born
a
man
i
would
by
now
have
made
a
deep
impression
of
myself
on
the
world
on
some
part
of
it
but
i
am
a
woman
and
god
or
the
devil
or
fate
or
whosoever
it
was
has
flayed
me
of
the
thick
outer
skin
and
thrown
me
out
into
the
midst
of
life
has
left
me
a
lonely
damned
thing
filled
with
the
red
red
blood
of
ambition
and
desire
but
afraid
to
be
touched
for
there
is
no
thick
skin
between
my
sensitive
flesh
and
the
world
s
fingers
but
i
want
to
be
touched
napoleon
was
a
man
and
though
sensitive
his
flesh
was
safely
covered
but
i
am
a
woman
awakening
and
upon
awakening
and
looking
about
me
i
would
fain
turn
and
go
back
to
sleep
there
is
a
pain
that
goes
with
these
things
when
one
is
a
woman
young
and
all
alone
i
am
filled
with
an
ambition
i
wish
to
give
to
the
world
a
naked
portrayal
of
mary
maclane
her
wooden
heart
her
good
young
woman
her
mind
her
soul
i
wish
to
write
write
write
i
wish
to
acquire
that
beautiful
benign
gentle
satisfying
thing
fame
i
want
it
oh
i
want
it
i
wish
to
leave
all
my
obscurity
my
misery
my
weary
unhappiness
behind
me
forever
i
am
deadly
deadly
tired
of
my
unhappiness
i
wish
this
portrayal
to
be
published
and
launched
into
that
deep
salt
sea
the
world
there
are
some
there
surely
who
will
understand
it
and
me
can
i
be
that
thing
which
i
am
can
i
be
possessed
of
a
peculiar
rare
genius
and
yet
drag
out
my
life
in
obscurity
in
this
uncouth
warped
montana
town
it
must
be
impossible
if
i
thought
the
world
contained
nothing
more
than
that
for
me
oh
what
should
i
do
would
i
make
an
end
of
my
dreary
little
life
now
i
fear
i
would
i
am
a
philosopher
and
a
coward
and
it
were
infinitely
better
to
die
now
in
the
pulses
of
youth
than
to
drag
on
year
after
year
year
after
year
and
find
oneself
at
last
a
stagnant
old
woman
spiritless
hopeless
with
a
declining
body
a
declining
mind
and
nothing
to
look
back
upon
except
the
visions
of
things
that
might
have
been
and
the
weariness
i
see
the
picture
i
see
it
plainly
oh
kind
devil
deliver
me
from
it
surely
there
must
be
in
a
world
of
manifold
beautiful
things
something
among
them
for
me
and
always
while
i
am
still
young
there
is
that
dim
light
the
future
but
it
is
indeed
a
dim
dim
light
and
ofttimes
there
s
a
treachery
in
it
january
so
then
yes
i
find
myself
at
this
stage
of
womankind
and
nineteen
years
a
genius
a
thief
a
liar
a
general
moral
vagabond
a
fool
more
or
less
and
a
philosopher
of
the
peripatetic
school
also
i
find
that
even
this
combination
can
not
make
one
happy
it
serves
however
to
occupy
my
versatile
mind
to
keep
me
wondering
what
it
is
a
kind
devil
has
in
store
for
me
a
philosopher
of
my
own
peripatetic
school
hour
after
hour
i
walk
over
the
desolate
sand
and
dreariness
among
tiny
hills
and
gulches
on
the
outskirts
of
this
mining
town
in
the
morning
in
the
long
afternoon
in
the
cool
of
the
night
and
hour
after
hour
as
i
walk
through
my
brain
some
long
long
pageants
march
the
pageant
of
my
fancies
the
pageant
of
my
unparalleled
egotism
the
pageant
of
my
unhappiness
the
pageant
of
my
minute
analyzing
the
pageant
of
my
peculiar
philosophy
the
pageant
of
my
dull
dull
life
and
the
pageant
of
the
possibilities
we
three
go
out
on
the
sand
and
barrenness
my
wooden
heart
my
good
young
woman
my
soul
we
go
there
and
contemplate
the
long
sandy
wastes
the
red
red
line
on
the
sky
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
the
cold
gloomy
mountains
under
it
the
ground
without
a
weed
without
a
even
in
their
season
for
they
have
years
ago
been
killed
off
by
the
sulphur
smoke
from
the
smelters
so
this
sand
and
barrenness
forms
the
setting
for
the
personality
of
me
january
i
feel
about
forty
years
old
yet
i
know
my
feeling
is
not
the
feeling
of
forty
years
these
are
the
feelings
of
miserable
wretched
youth
every
day
the
atmosphere
of
a
house
becomes
unbearable
so
every
day
i
go
out
to
the
sand
and
barrenness
it
is
not
cold
neither
is
it
mild
it
is
gloomy
i
sit
for
two
hours
on
the
ground
by
the
side
of
a
pitiably
small
narrow
stream
of
water
it
is
not
even
a
natural
stream
i
dare
say
it
comes
from
some
mine
among
the
hills
but
it
is
well
enough
that
the
stream
is
not
natural
when
you
consider
the
sand
and
barrenness
it
is
singularly
appropriate
and
i
am
singularly
appropriate
to
all
of
them
it
is
good
after
all
to
be
appropriate
to
something
to
be
in
touch
with
something
even
sand
and
barrenness
the
sand
and
barrenness
is
old
oh
very
old
you
think
of
this
when
you
look
at
it
what
should
i
do
if
the
earth
were
made
of
wood
with
a
paper
sky
i
feel
about
forty
years
old
and
again
i
say
i
know
my
feeling
is
not
the
feeling
of
forty
years
these
are
the
feelings
of
miserable
wretched
youth
still
more
pitiable
than
the
sand
and
barrenness
and
the
poor
unnatural
stream
is
the
dry
warped
cemetery
where
the
dry
warped
people
of
butte
bury
their
dead
friends
it
is
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
me
to
walk
down
to
this
cemetery
and
contemplate
it
and
revel
in
its
utter
pitiableness
it
is
more
pitiable
than
i
and
my
sand
and
barrenness
and
my
poor
unnatural
stream
i
say
over
and
over
and
take
my
comfort
its
condition
is
more
forlorn
than
that
of
a
woman
young
and
alone
it
is
unkempt
it
is
choked
with
dust
and
stones
the
few
scattered
blades
of
grass
look
rather
ashamed
to
be
seen
growing
there
a
great
many
of
the
headstones
are
of
wood
and
are
in
a
shameful
state
of
decay
those
that
are
of
stone
are
still
more
shameful
in
their
hard
brightness
the
dry
warped
friends
of
the
dry
warped
people
of
butte
are
buried
in
this
dusty
dreary
waste
they
are
left
here
and
forgotten
the
devil
must
rejoice
in
this
graveyard
and
i
rejoice
with
the
devil
it
is
something
for
me
to
contemplate
that
is
more
pitiable
than
i
and
my
sand
and
barrenness
and
my
unnatural
stream
i
rejoice
with
the
devil
the
inhabitants
of
this
cemetery
are
forgotten
i
have
watched
once
the
burying
of
a
young
child
every
day
for
a
fortnight
afterward
i
came
back
and
i
saw
the
mother
of
the
child
there
she
came
and
stood
by
the
small
new
grave
after
a
few
days
more
she
stopped
coming
i
knew
the
woman
and
went
to
her
house
to
see
her
she
was
beginning
to
forget
the
child
she
was
beginning
to
take
up
again
the
thread
of
her
life
where
she
had
let
it
go
the
thread
of
her
life
is
involved
in
the
divorces
and
fights
of
her
neighbors
out
in
the
warped
graveyard
her
child
is
forgotten
and
presently
the
wooden
headstone
will
begin
to
decay
but
the
worms
will
not
forget
their
part
they
have
eaten
the
small
body
by
now
and
enjoyed
it
always
worms
enjoy
a
body
to
eat
and
also
the
devil
rejoiced
and
i
rejoiced
with
the
devil
they
are
more
pitiable
i
insist
than
i
and
my
sand
and
barrenness
the
mother
whose
life
is
involved
in
divorces
and
fights
and
the
worms
eating
at
the
child
s
body
and
the
wooden
headstone
which
will
presently
decay
and
so
the
devil
and
i
rejoice
but
no
matter
how
ferociously
pitiable
is
the
graveyard
the
sand
and
barrenness
and
the
sluggish
little
stream
have
their
own
persistent
individual
damnation
the
world
is
at
least
so
constructed
that
its
treasures
may
be
damned
each
in
a
different
manner
and
degree
i
feel
about
forty
years
old
and
i
know
my
feeling
is
not
the
feeling
of
forty
years
they
do
not
feel
any
of
these
things
at
forty
at
forty
the
fire
has
long
since
burned
out
when
i
am
forty
i
shall
look
back
to
myself
and
my
feelings
at
nineteen
and
i
shall
smile
or
shall
i
indeed
smile
january
as
i
have
said
i
want
fame
i
want
to
write
to
write
such
things
as
compel
the
admiring
acclamations
of
the
world
at
large
such
things
as
are
written
but
once
in
years
things
subtly
but
distinctly
different
from
the
books
written
every
day
i
can
do
this
let
me
but
make
a
beginning
let
me
but
strike
the
world
in
a
vulnerable
spot
and
i
can
take
it
by
storm
let
me
but
win
my
spurs
and
then
you
will
see
me
of
womankind
and
young
valiantly
astride
a
charger
riding
down
the
world
with
fame
following
at
the
charger
s
heels
and
the
multitudes
agape
but
oh
more
than
all
this
i
want
to
be
happy
fame
is
indeed
benign
and
gentle
and
satisfying
but
happiness
is
something
at
once
tender
and
brilliant
beyond
all
things
i
want
fame
more
than
i
can
tell
but
more
than
i
want
fame
i
want
happiness
i
have
never
been
happy
in
my
weary
young
life
think
oh
of
being
happy
for
a
year
for
a
day
how
brilliantly
blue
the
sky
would
be
how
swiftly
and
joyously
would
the
green
rivers
run
how
madly
merrily
triumphant
the
four
winds
of
heaven
would
sweep
round
the
corners
of
the
fair
earth
what
would
i
not
give
for
one
day
one
hour
of
that
charmed
thing
happiness
what
would
i
not
give
up
how
we
eager
fools
tread
on
each
other
s
heels
and
tear
each
other
s
hair
and
scratch
each
other
s
faces
in
our
furious
gallop
after
happiness
for
some
it
is
embodied
in
fame
for
some
in
money
for
some
in
power
for
some
in
virtue
and
for
me
in
something
very
much
like
love
none
of
the
other
fools
desires
happiness
as
i
desire
it
for
one
single
hour
of
happiness
i
would
give
up
at
once
these
things
fame
and
money
and
power
and
virtue
and
honor
and
righteousness
and
truth
and
logic
and
philosophy
and
genius
the
while
i
would
say
what
a
little
little
price
to
pay
for
dear
happiness
i
am
ready
and
waiting
to
give
all
that
i
have
to
the
devil
in
exchange
for
happiness
i
have
been
tortured
so
long
with
the
dull
dull
misery
of
nothingness
all
my
nineteen
years
i
want
to
be
happy
oh
i
want
to
be
happy
the
devil
has
not
yet
come
but
i
know
that
he
usually
comes
and
i
wait
him
eagerly
i
am
fortunate
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
are
burdened
with
an
innate
sense
of
virtue
and
honor
which
must
come
always
before
happiness
they
are
but
few
who
find
their
happiness
in
their
virtue
the
rest
of
them
must
be
content
to
see
it
walk
away
but
with
me
virtue
and
honor
are
nothing
i
long
unspeakably
for
happiness
and
so
i
await
the
devil
s
coming
january
and
meanwhile
as
i
wait
my
mind
occupies
itself
with
its
own
good
odd
philosophy
so
that
even
the
nothingness
becomes
almost
endurable
the
devil
has
given
me
some
good
things
for
i
find
that
the
devil
owns
and
rules
the
earth
and
all
that
therein
is
he
has
given
me
among
other
things
my
admirable
young
woman
which
i
enjoy
thoroughly
and
of
which
i
am
passionately
fond
a
spasm
of
pleasure
seizes
me
when
i
think
in
some
acute
moment
of
the
buoyant
health
and
vitality
of
this
fine
young
body
that
is
feminine
in
every
fiber
you
may
gaze
at
and
admire
the
picture
in
the
front
of
this
book
it
is
the
picture
of
a
genius
a
genius
with
a
good
strong
young
woman
and
inside
the
pictured
body
is
a
liver
a
maclane
liver
of
admirable
perfectness
other
young
women
and
older
women
and
men
of
all
ages
have
good
bodies
also
i
doubt
not
though
the
masculine
body
is
merely
flesh
it
seems
flesh
and
bones
and
nothing
else
but
few
recognize
the
value
of
their
bodies
few
have
grasped
the
possibilities
the
artistic
graceful
perfection
the
poetry
of
human
flesh
in
its
health
few
have
even
sense
enough
indeed
to
keep
their
flesh
in
health
or
to
know
what
health
is
until
they
have
ruined
some
vital
organ
and
so
banished
it
forever
i
have
not
ruined
any
of
my
vital
organs
and
i
appreciate
what
health
is
i
have
grasped
the
art
the
poetry
of
my
fine
feminine
body
this
at
the
age
of
nineteen
is
a
triumph
for
me
sometime
in
the
midst
of
the
brightness
of
an
october
i
have
walked
for
miles
in
the
still
high
air
under
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
brightness
of
the
day
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
incomparable
high
air
have
entered
into
my
veins
and
flowed
with
my
red
blood
they
have
penetrated
into
every
remote
and
into
the
marrow
of
my
bones
at
such
a
time
this
young
body
glows
with
life
my
red
blood
flows
swiftly
and
joyously
in
the
midst
of
the
brightness
of
october
my
sound
sensitive
liver
rests
gently
with
its
thin
yellow
bile
in
sweet
content
my
calm
beautiful
stomach
silently
sings
as
i
walk
a
song
of
peace
my
lungs
saturated
with
mountain
ozone
and
the
perfume
of
the
pines
expand
in
continuous
ecstasy
my
heart
beats
like
the
music
of
schumann
in
easy
graceful
rhythm
with
an
undertone
of
power
my
strong
and
sensitive
nerves
are
reeking
and
swimming
in
sensuality
like
drunken
little
bacchantes
gay
and
garlanded
in
mad
revelling
the
entire
wonderful
graceful
mechanism
of
my
woman
has
fallen
at
the
time
like
the
wonderful
graceful
mechanism
of
my
woman
under
the
enchanting
spell
of
a
day
in
october
it
is
good
i
think
to
myself
oh
it
is
good
to
be
alive
it
is
wondrously
good
to
be
a
woman
young
in
the
fullness
of
nineteen
springs
it
is
unutterably
lovely
to
be
a
healthy
young
animal
living
on
this
charmed
after
i
have
walked
for
several
hours
i
reach
a
region
where
the
sulphur
smoke
has
not
penetrated
and
i
sit
on
the
ground
with
knees
and
rest
as
the
shadows
lengthen
the
shadows
lengthen
early
in
october
presently
i
lie
flat
on
my
back
and
stretch
my
lithe
slimness
to
its
utmost
like
a
mountain
lioness
taking
her
comfort
i
am
intensely
thankful
to
the
devil
for
my
two
good
legs
and
the
full
use
of
them
under
a
short
skirt
when
as
now
they
carry
me
out
beyond
the
pale
of
civilization
away
from
tiresome
dull
people
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
can
become
so
maddeningly
wearisome
as
people
people
people
and
so
devil
accept
for
my
two
good
legs
my
sincerest
gratitude
i
lie
on
the
ground
for
some
minutes
and
meditate
idly
there
is
a
worldful
of
easy
indolent
beautiful
sensuality
in
the
figure
of
a
young
woman
lying
on
the
ground
under
a
warm
setting
sun
a
man
may
lie
on
the
ground
but
that
is
as
far
as
it
goes
a
man
would
go
to
sleep
probably
like
a
dog
or
a
pig
he
would
even
snore
perhaps
under
the
setting
sun
but
then
a
man
has
not
a
good
young
feminine
body
to
feel
with
to
receive
into
itself
the
spirit
of
a
warm
sun
at
its
setting
on
a
day
in
october
and
so
let
us
forgive
him
for
sleeping
and
for
snoring
when
i
rise
again
to
a
sitting
posture
all
the
brightness
has
focused
itself
to
the
west
it
casts
a
yellow
glamor
over
the
earth
a
glamor
not
of
joy
nor
of
pleasure
nor
of
happiness
but
of
peace
the
young
poplar
trees
smile
gently
in
the
deathly
still
air
the
sage
brush
and
the
tall
grass
take
on
a
radiant
quietness
the
high
hills
of
montana
near
and
distant
appear
tender
and
benign
all
is
peace
peace
i
think
of
that
beautiful
old
song
sweet
vale
of
avoca
how
calm
could
i
rest
in
thy
bosom
of
shade
but
i
am
too
young
yet
to
think
of
peace
it
is
not
peace
that
i
want
peace
is
for
forty
and
fifty
i
am
waiting
for
my
experience
i
am
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
devil
and
now
just
before
twilight
after
the
sun
has
vanished
over
the
edge
is
the
red
red
line
on
the
sky
there
will
be
days
wild
and
stormy
filled
with
rain
and
wind
and
hail
and
yet
nearly
always
at
the
sun
s
setting
there
will
be
calm
and
the
red
line
of
sky
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
quite
like
this
red
sky
at
sunset
it
is
glory
triumph
love
fame
imagine
a
life
bereft
of
things
and
fingers
pointed
at
it
and
eyebrows
raised
tossed
and
bandied
hither
and
yon
crushed
beaten
bled
rent
asunder
outraged
convulsed
with
pain
and
then
into
this
life
while
still
young
the
red
red
line
of
sky
why
did
i
cry
out
against
fate
says
the
line
why
did
i
rebel
against
my
term
of
anguish
i
now
rather
rejoice
at
it
now
in
my
happiness
i
remember
it
only
with
deep
pleasure
think
of
that
wonderful
admirable
matchless
man
of
steel
napoleon
bonaparte
he
threw
himself
heavily
on
the
world
and
the
world
has
never
since
been
the
same
he
hated
himself
and
the
world
and
god
and
fate
and
the
devil
his
hatred
was
his
term
of
anguish
then
the
sun
threw
on
the
sky
for
him
a
red
red
line
the
red
line
of
triumph
glory
fame
and
afterward
there
was
the
blackness
of
night
the
blackness
that
is
not
tender
not
gentle
but
black
as
our
night
may
be
nothing
can
take
from
us
the
memory
of
the
red
red
sky
memory
is
possession
and
so
the
red
sky
we
have
with
us
always
oh
devil
fate
world
some
one
bring
me
my
red
sky
for
a
little
brief
time
and
i
will
be
satisfied
bring
it
to
me
intensely
red
intensely
full
intensely
alive
short
as
you
will
but
red
red
red
i
am
weary
weary
and
oh
i
want
my
red
sky
short
as
it
might
be
its
memory
its
fragrance
would
stay
with
me
always
always
bring
me
devil
my
red
line
of
sky
for
one
hour
and
take
all
everything
i
possess
let
me
keep
my
happiness
for
one
short
hour
and
take
away
all
from
me
forever
i
will
be
satisfied
when
night
has
come
and
everything
is
gone
oh
i
await
you
devil
in
a
wild
frenzy
of
impatience
and
as
i
hurry
back
through
the
cool
darkness
of
october
i
feel
this
frenzy
in
every
fiber
of
my
fervid
woman
january
i
come
from
a
long
line
of
scotch
and
canadian
maclanes
there
are
a
great
many
maclanes
but
there
is
usually
only
one
real
maclane
in
each
generation
there
is
but
one
who
feels
again
the
passionate
spirit
of
the
clans
those
barbaric
dwellers
in
the
bleak
but
highlands
of
scotland
i
am
the
real
maclane
of
my
generation
the
real
maclane
in
these
later
centuries
is
always
a
woman
the
men
of
the
family
never
amount
to
anything
worth
naming
if
one
accepts
the
acme
the
zenith
of
pure
selfishness
with
a
large
letter
life
may
be
easy
enough
for
the
innumerable
canadian
maclanes
who
are
not
real
but
it
is
certain
to
be
more
or
less
a
hill
of
difficulty
for
the
one
who
is
she
finds
herself
somewhat
alone
i
have
brothers
and
a
sister
and
a
mother
in
the
same
house
with
me
and
i
find
myself
somewhat
alone
between
them
and
me
there
is
no
tenderness
no
sympathy
no
binding
ties
would
it
affect
me
in
the
least
do
you
suppose
if
they
should
all
die
if
i
were
not
a
real
maclane
perhaps
it
would
have
been
different
or
perhaps
i
should
not
have
missed
these
things
how
much
devil
have
i
lost
for
the
privilege
of
being
a
real
maclane
but
yes
i
have
also
gained
much
january
i
have
said
that
i
am
alone
i
am
not
quite
quite
alone
i
have
one
friend
of
that
friendship
that
is
real
and
is
inlaid
with
the
beautiful
thing
truth
and
because
it
has
the
beautiful
thing
truth
in
it
this
my
one
friendship
is
somehow
above
and
beyond
me
there
is
something
in
it
that
i
reach
after
in
vain
for
i
have
not
that
divinely
beautiful
thing
truth
have
i
not
said
that
i
am
a
thief
and
a
liar
but
in
this
friendship
nevertheless
there
is
a
rare
ineffably
sweet
something
that
is
mine
it
is
the
one
tender
thing
in
this
dull
dreariness
that
wraps
me
round
are
there
many
things
in
this
world
so
utterly
exquisite
as
the
pure
love
of
one
woman
for
another
woman
my
one
friend
is
a
woman
some
twelve
or
thirteen
years
older
than
i
she
is
as
different
from
me
as
is
day
from
night
she
believes
in
god
that
god
that
is
shown
in
the
bible
of
the
christians
and
she
carries
with
her
an
atmosphere
of
gentleness
and
truth
the
while
i
am
ready
and
waiting
to
dedicate
my
life
to
the
devil
in
exchange
for
happiness
or
some
lesser
thing
but
i
love
fannie
corbin
with
a
peculiar
and
vivid
intensity
and
with
all
the
sincerity
and
passion
that
is
in
me
often
i
think
of
her
as
i
walk
over
the
sand
in
my
nothingness
all
day
long
the
friendship
of
her
and
me
is
a
fair
dear
benediction
upon
me
but
there
is
something
in
it
deep
within
it
that
eludes
me
in
moments
when
i
realize
this
when
i
strain
and
reach
vainly
at
a
thing
beyond
me
when
indeed
i
see
in
my
mind
a
vision
of
the
personality
of
fannie
corbin
it
is
then
that
it
comes
on
me
with
force
that
i
am
not
good
but
i
can
love
her
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
young
and
passionate
heart
yes
i
can
do
that
for
a
year
i
have
loved
my
one
friend
during
the
eighteen
years
of
my
life
before
she
came
into
it
i
loved
no
one
for
there
was
no
one
it
is
an
extremely
hard
thing
to
go
through
eighteen
years
with
no
one
to
love
and
no
one
to
love
you
the
first
eighteen
years
but
now
i
have
my
one
friend
to
love
and
to
worship
i
have
named
my
friend
the
anemone
lady
a
name
beautifully
appropriate
the
anemone
lady
used
to
teach
me
literature
in
the
butte
high
school
she
used
to
read
poetry
in
the
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
that
made
one
wish
one
might
sit
there
forever
and
listen
to
it
but
now
i
have
left
the
high
school
and
the
dear
anemone
lady
has
gone
from
butte
before
she
went
she
told
me
she
would
be
my
friend
think
of
it
to
live
and
have
a
friend
my
friend
does
not
fully
understand
me
she
thinks
much
too
well
of
me
she
has
not
a
correct
idea
of
my
soul
s
depths
and
shallows
but
if
she
did
know
them
she
would
still
be
my
friend
she
knows
the
heavy
weight
of
my
unrest
and
unhappiness
she
is
tenderly
sympathetic
she
is
the
one
in
all
the
world
who
is
dear
to
me
often
i
think
if
only
i
could
have
my
anemone
lady
and
go
and
live
with
her
in
some
little
place
high
up
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
for
the
rest
of
my
life
what
more
would
i
desire
my
friendship
would
constitute
my
life
the
unrest
the
dreariness
the
nothingness
of
my
existence
now
is
so
dull
and
gray
by
contrast
that
there
would
be
happiness
for
me
in
that
life
happiness
softly
radiant
if
quiet
redolent
of
the
fresh
thin
fragrance
of
the
dear
blue
anemone
that
grows
in
the
winds
and
rains
of
spring
but
miss
corbin
would
doubtless
look
somewhat
askance
at
the
idea
of
spending
the
rest
of
her
life
with
me
on
a
mountain
she
is
very
fond
of
me
but
her
feeling
for
me
is
not
like
mine
for
her
which
indeed
is
natural
and
her
life
is
made
up
mostly
of
sacrifices
doing
for
her
giving
of
herself
she
never
would
leave
this
and
so
then
the
mountainside
and
the
solitude
and
the
friend
with
me
are
like
every
good
thing
but
a
vision
thy
friend
is
always
thy
friend
not
to
have
nor
to
hold
nor
to
love
nor
to
rejoice
in
but
to
and
so
do
i
remember
my
one
friend
the
anemone
lady
and
think
often
about
her
with
passionate
love
january
happiness
don
t
you
know
is
of
three
kinds
and
all
are
transitory
it
never
stays
but
it
comes
and
goes
there
is
that
happiness
that
comes
from
feet
for
instance
and
a
pair
of
clean
stockings
on
them
particularly
after
one
has
been
upon
a
tramp
into
the
country
always
i
have
identified
this
kind
of
happiness
with
a
maltese
cat
dipping
a
hungry
stealthy
sensual
tongue
into
a
bowl
of
fresh
thick
cream
there
is
that
still
happiness
that
has
come
to
me
at
rare
times
when
i
have
been
with
my
one
friend
and
which
does
very
well
for
people
whose
feelings
are
moderate
they
need
wish
for
nothing
beyond
it
they
could
not
appreciate
anything
deeper
and
there
is
that
kind
of
happiness
which
is
of
the
red
sunset
sky
there
is
something
terrible
in
the
thought
of
this
indescribable
mad
happiness
what
a
thing
it
is
for
a
human
being
to
be
with
the
red
red
happiness
of
the
sunset
sky
it
s
like
a
terrific
storm
in
summer
with
rain
and
wind
beating
quiet
water
into
wild
waves
bending
great
trees
to
the
ground
convulsing
the
green
earth
with
delicious
pain
it
s
like
something
of
schubert
s
played
on
the
violin
that
stirs
you
within
to
exquisite
torture
it
s
like
the
human
voice
divine
singing
a
scotch
ballad
in
a
manner
to
drag
your
soul
from
your
body
but
there
are
no
words
to
tell
it
it
is
something
infinitely
above
and
beyond
words
it
is
the
kind
of
happiness
the
devil
will
bring
to
me
when
he
comes
to
me
to
oh
why
does
he
not
come
now
when
i
am
in
the
midst
of
my
youth
why
is
he
so
long
in
coming
often
you
hear
a
dozen
stories
of
how
the
devil
was
most
ready
and
willing
to
take
all
from
some
one
and
give
him
his
measure
of
happiness
and
sometimes
the
person
was
innately
virtuous
and
so
could
not
take
the
happiness
when
it
was
offered
but
happiness
is
its
own
justification
and
it
should
be
eagerly
grasped
when
it
comes
a
world
filled
with
fools
will
never
learn
this
and
so
here
i
stand
in
the
midst
of
nothingness
waiting
and
longing
for
the
devil
and
he
doesn
t
come
i
feel
a
choking
strangling
frenzied
feeling
of
waiting
oh
why
doesn
t
my
happiness
come
i
have
waited
so
long
so
long
there
are
persons
who
say
to
me
that
i
ought
not
to
think
of
the
devil
that
i
ought
not
to
think
of
happiness
happiness
for
me
would
be
sure
to
mean
something
wicked
as
if
happiness
could
ever
be
wicked
that
i
ought
to
think
of
being
good
i
ought
to
think
of
god
these
are
persons
who
help
to
fill
the
world
with
fools
at
any
rate
their
words
are
unable
to
affect
me
i
can
not
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
in
this
scheme
of
things
it
is
one
of
the
lines
of
reasoning
in
which
i
have
gotten
to
the
edge
the
end
i
have
gotten
to
the
point
to
which
all
logic
finally
leads
i
can
only
say
what
is
wrong
what
is
right
what
is
good
what
is
evil
the
words
are
merely
words
with
truth
is
love
and
love
is
the
only
truth
and
love
is
the
one
thing
out
of
all
that
is
real
the
devil
is
really
the
only
one
to
whom
we
may
turn
and
he
exacts
payment
in
full
for
every
favor
but
surely
he
will
come
one
day
with
happiness
for
me
yet
oh
how
can
i
wait
to
be
a
woman
young
and
all
alone
is
hard
is
to
want
things
is
to
carry
a
heavy
heavy
weight
oh
damn
damn
damn
damn
every
living
thing
the
world
the
universe
be
damned
oh
i
am
weary
weary
can
t
you
see
that
i
am
weary
and
pity
me
in
my
own
damnation
january
it
is
night
i
might
well
be
in
my
bed
taking
a
needed
rest
but
first
i
shall
write
i
walked
far
away
over
the
sand
in
the
teeth
of
a
bitter
wind
the
wind
was
determined
that
i
should
turn
and
come
back
and
equally
i
was
determined
i
would
go
on
i
went
on
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
wind
in
the
autumn
to
walk
in
the
midst
of
which
causes
one
s
spirits
to
rise
ecstatically
to
walk
in
the
midst
of
a
bitter
wind
in
january
may
have
almost
any
effect
the
bitter
wind
swept
over
me
and
around
me
and
into
the
remote
corners
of
my
brain
and
swept
away
the
delusions
and
buffeted
my
philosophy
with
rough
insolence
the
world
is
made
up
mostly
of
nothing
you
may
be
convinced
of
this
when
a
bitter
wind
has
swept
away
your
delusions
what
is
the
wind
nothing
what
is
the
sky
nothing
what
do
we
know
nothing
what
is
fame
nothing
what
is
my
heart
nothing
what
is
my
soul
nothing
what
are
we
we
are
nothing
we
think
we
progress
wonderfully
in
the
arts
and
sciences
as
one
century
follows
another
what
does
it
amount
to
it
does
not
teach
us
the
it
does
not
let
us
cease
to
wonder
what
it
is
that
we
are
doing
where
it
is
that
we
are
going
it
does
not
teach
us
why
the
green
comes
again
to
the
old
old
hills
in
the
spring
why
the
benign
shines
wet
and
sweet
after
the
rain
why
the
red
never
fails
to
come
to
the
breast
of
the
robin
the
black
to
the
crow
the
gray
to
the
little
wren
why
the
sand
and
barrenness
lies
stretched
out
around
us
why
the
clouds
float
high
above
us
why
the
moon
stands
in
the
sky
night
after
night
why
the
mountains
and
valleys
live
on
as
the
years
pass
the
arts
and
sciences
go
on
and
on
still
we
wonder
we
have
not
yet
ceased
to
weep
and
we
suffer
still
in
even
as
they
suffered
in
and
in
we
eat
our
good
dinners
with
forks
a
thousand
years
ago
they
had
no
forks
yet
though
we
have
forks
we
are
not
happy
we
scream
and
kick
and
struggle
and
weep
just
as
they
did
a
thousand
years
ago
when
they
had
no
forks
we
are
no
wiser
than
when
omar
fell
and
in
the
midst
of
our
great
wondering
we
wonder
why
some
of
us
are
given
faith
to
trust
without
question
while
the
rest
of
us
are
left
to
eat
out
our
life
s
vitals
with
asking
i
have
walked
once
in
summer
by
the
side
of
a
little
marsh
filled
with
mint
and
white
hawthorn
the
mint
and
white
hawthorn
have
with
them
a
vivid
rare
delicious
perfume
it
makes
you
want
to
grovel
on
the
ground
it
makes
you
think
you
might
crawl
in
the
dust
all
your
days
and
well
for
you
the
perfume
lingers
with
you
afterward
when
years
have
passed
you
may
scream
and
kick
and
struggle
and
weep
right
lustily
every
day
of
your
life
but
in
your
moments
of
calmness
sometimes
there
will
come
back
to
you
the
fragrance
of
a
swamp
filled
with
mint
and
white
hawthorn
it
is
meltingly
beautiful
what
does
it
mean
what
would
it
tell
why
does
the
marsh
and
the
mint
and
white
hawthorn
freeze
over
in
the
fall
and
why
do
they
come
again
voluptuous
enticing
in
the
damp
spring
days
and
rack
the
souls
of
wretches
who
look
and
wonder
you
are
superb
devil
you
have
done
a
magnificent
piece
of
work
i
kneel
at
your
feet
and
worship
you
you
have
wrought
a
perfection
a
pinnacle
of
fine
invisible
damnation
the
world
is
like
a
little
marsh
filled
with
mint
and
white
hawthorn
it
is
filled
with
things
likewise
damnably
beautiful
there
are
the
green
green
and
the
gray
dawns
there
are
rivers
and
the
honking
of
wild
geese
flying
low
there
are
human
voices
and
human
eyes
there
are
stories
of
women
and
men
who
have
learned
to
give
up
and
to
wait
there
is
poetry
there
is
charity
there
is
truth
the
devil
has
made
all
of
these
things
and
also
he
has
made
human
beings
who
can
feel
who
was
it
that
said
long
ago
life
is
always
a
tragedy
to
those
who
feel
in
truth
the
devil
has
constructed
a
place
of
infinite
torture
the
fair
green
earth
the
world
but
he
has
made
that
other
infinite
thing
happiness
i
forgive
him
for
making
me
wonder
since
possibly
he
may
bring
me
happiness
i
cast
myself
at
his
feet
i
adore
him
the
first
third
of
our
lives
is
spent
in
the
expectation
of
happiness
then
it
comes
perhaps
and
stays
ten
years
or
a
month
or
three
days
and
the
rest
of
our
lives
is
spent
in
peace
and
rest
with
the
memory
of
the
happiness
happiness
though
it
is
infinite
is
a
transient
emotion
it
is
too
brilliant
too
magnificent
too
overwhelming
to
be
a
lasting
thing
and
it
is
merely
an
emotion
but
ah
an
emotion
through
it
the
devil
rules
his
domains
what
would
one
not
do
to
have
it
i
can
think
of
no
vile
deed
that
i
would
scruple
about
if
i
could
be
happy
everything
is
justified
if
it
gives
me
happiness
the
devil
has
done
me
some
great
favors
he
has
made
me
without
a
conscience
and
without
virtue
for
which
i
thank
thee
devil
at
least
i
shall
be
able
to
take
my
happiness
when
it
comes
even
though
the
piles
of
nice
distinctions
between
it
and
me
be
mountains
high
but
meanwhile
the
world
i
say
and
the
people
are
nothing
nothing
nothing
the
splendid
castles
the
strong
bridges
that
we
are
building
are
of
small
moment
we
can
only
go
down
the
wide
roadway
wondering
and
weeping
and
without
where
to
lay
our
heads
january
i
have
eaten
my
dinner
i
have
had
among
other
things
fine
porterhouse
steak
from
omaha
and
some
fresh
green
young
onions
from
california
and
just
now
i
am
a
philosopher
pure
and
simple
except
that
there
s
nothing
very
pure
about
my
philosophy
nor
yet
very
simple
let
the
devil
come
and
go
let
the
wild
waters
rush
over
me
let
nations
rise
and
fall
let
my
favorite
theories
form
themselves
in
line
suddenly
and
run
into
the
ground
let
the
little
earth
be
bandied
about
from
one
belief
to
another
but
i
say
in
the
midst
of
my
young
peripatetic
philosophy
i
need
not
be
in
complete
despair
the
world
still
contains
things
for
me
while
i
have
my
fine
rare
porterhouse
steak
from
omaha
and
my
fresh
green
young
onions
from
california
fame
may
pass
over
my
head
money
may
escape
me
my
one
friend
may
fail
me
every
hope
may
fold
its
tent
and
steal
away
happiness
may
remain
a
sealed
book
every
remnant
of
human
ties
may
vanish
i
may
find
myself
an
outcast
good
things
held
out
to
me
may
suddenly
be
withdrawn
the
stars
may
go
out
one
by
one
the
sun
may
go
dark
yet
still
i
may
hold
upright
my
head
if
i
have
but
my
steak
and
my
onions
i
may
find
myself
crowded
out
from
many
charmed
circles
i
may
find
the
ethical
world
too
small
to
contain
me
the
social
world
may
also
exclude
me
the
professional
world
may
know
me
not
likewise
the
worlds
of
the
arts
and
the
sciences
i
may
find
myself
superfluous
in
literary
haunts
i
may
see
myself
going
gladly
back
to
the
vile
dust
from
whence
i
sprung
to
live
in
a
green
forest
like
the
melancholy
jacques
but
fare
they
well
i
will
say
with
what
cheerfulness
i
can
summon
while
i
have
my
steak
and
my
onions
possibly
i
may
grow
old
and
decrepit
my
hair
may
turn
gray
my
bones
may
become
rheumatic
i
may
grow
weak
in
the
knees
my
which
have
withstood
many
a
peripatetic
journey
may
develop
dropsical
tendencies
my
heart
may
miss
a
beat
now
and
then
my
lungs
may
begin
to
fight
shy
of
wintry
blasts
my
eyes
may
fail
me
my
figure
that
is
now
in
its
slim
gracefulness
may
swathe
itself
in
layers
of
flesh
or
worse
it
may
wither
and
decay
and
stoop
at
the
shoulders
my
red
blood
may
flow
sluggishly
but
if
i
still
have
left
teeth
to
eat
with
why
need
i
lament
while
i
have
my
steak
and
my
onions
i
am
obscure
i
am
morbid
i
am
unhappy
my
life
is
made
up
of
nothingness
i
want
everything
and
i
have
nothing
i
have
been
made
to
feel
the
lure
of
green
things
growing
and
i
have
been
made
to
feel
also
that
something
of
them
is
withheld
from
me
i
have
felt
the
deadly
tiredness
that
is
among
the
birthrights
of
a
human
being
but
with
it
all
the
devil
has
given
me
a
philosophy
of
my
own
the
devil
has
enabled
me
to
count
if
need
be
the
world
well
lost
for
a
fine
rare
porterhouse
steak
and
some
green
young
onions
for
which
i
thank
thee
devil
profoundly
who
says
the
devil
is
not
your
friend
who
says
the
devil
does
not
believe
in
the
law
of
compensation
and
so
it
is
do
you
see
that
all
things
look
different
after
a
satisfying
dinner
that
the
color
of
the
world
changes
that
life
in
fact
resolves
itself
into
two
things
a
fine
porterhouse
steak
from
omaha
and
some
fresh
green
young
onions
from
california
january
i
am
charmingly
original
i
am
delightfully
refreshing
i
am
startlingly
bohemian
i
am
quaintly
interesting
the
while
in
my
sleeve
i
may
be
smiling
and
smiling
and
a
villain
i
can
talk
to
a
roomful
of
dull
people
and
compel
their
interest
admiration
and
astonishment
i
do
this
sometimes
for
my
own
amusement
as
i
have
said
i
am
a
rather
genius
but
i
have
a
graceful
personality
i
have
a
pretty
figure
i
am
well
set
up
and
when
i
choose
to
talk
in
my
charmingly
original
fashion
embellishing
my
conversation
with
many
quaint
lies
i
have
a
certain
very
noticeable
way
with
me
an
it
is
well
if
one
has
nothing
else
to
acquire
an
air
and
an
air
taken
in
conjunction
with
my
charming
originality
my
delightfully
refreshing
candor
is
something
powerful
and
striking
in
its
way
i
do
not
however
exert
myself
often
in
this
way
partly
because
i
can
sometimes
foresee
from
the
character
of
the
assembled
company
that
my
performance
will
not
have
the
desired
effect
for
i
am
a
genius
and
genius
at
close
range
at
times
carries
itself
unconsciously
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
so
interesting
that
it
is
atrocious
and
can
not
be
carried
farther
without
having
somewhat
mildly
disastrous
results
and
then
again
the
facial
antics
of
some
ten
or
a
dozen
persons
possessed
more
or
less
of
the
qualities
of
the
genus
fool
even
they
become
tiresome
after
a
while
always
i
talk
about
myself
on
an
occasion
of
this
kind
indeed
my
conversation
is
on
all
occasions
devoted
directly
or
indirectly
to
myself
when
i
talk
on
the
subject
of
ethics
i
talk
of
it
as
it
is
related
to
mary
maclane
when
i
give
out
opinions
about
ninon
de
l
enclos
i
demonstrate
her
relative
position
to
mary
maclane
when
i
discourse
liberally
on
the
subject
of
the
married
relation
i
talk
of
it
only
as
it
will
affect
mary
maclane
an
interesting
creature
mary
maclane
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
so
with
every
one
only
every
one
is
far
from
realizing
and
acknowledging
it
and
i
have
not
lacked
listeners
though
these
people
do
not
appreciate
me
they
do
not
realize
that
i
am
a
genius
i
am
of
womankind
and
of
nineteen
years
i
am
able
to
stand
off
and
gaze
critically
and
dispassionately
at
myself
and
my
relation
to
my
environment
to
the
world
to
everything
the
world
contains
i
am
able
to
judge
whether
i
am
good
and
whether
i
am
bad
i
am
able
indeed
to
tell
what
i
am
and
where
i
stand
i
can
see
far
far
inward
i
am
a
genius
charlotte
bronté
did
this
in
some
degree
and
she
was
a
genius
and
also
marie
bashkirtseff
and
olive
schreiner
and
george
eliot
they
are
all
geniuses
and
so
then
i
am
a
genius
a
genius
in
my
own
right
i
am
fundamentally
organically
egotistic
my
vanity
and
have
attained
truly
remarkable
development
as
i
ve
walked
and
walked
in
the
loneliness
of
the
sand
and
barrenness
not
the
least
remarkable
part
of
it
is
that
i
know
my
egotism
and
vanity
thoroughly
thoroughly
and
plume
myself
thereon
these
are
the
of
a
genius
and
of
a
fool
there
is
a
line
between
a
genius
and
a
fool
often
this
line
is
overstepped
and
your
fool
becomes
a
genius
or
your
genius
becomes
a
fool
it
is
but
a
tiny
step
there
s
but
a
tiny
step
between
the
great
and
the
little
the
tender
and
the
contemptuous
the
sublime
and
the
ridiculous
the
aggressive
and
the
humble
the
paradise
and
the
perdition
and
so
is
it
between
the
genius
and
the
fool
i
am
a
genius
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
how
many
times
i
may
overstep
the
line
or
how
many
times
i
have
already
overstepped
it
tis
a
matter
of
small
moment
i
have
entered
into
certain
things
marvelously
deep
i
know
things
i
know
that
i
know
them
and
i
know
that
i
know
that
i
know
them
which
is
a
fine
psychological
point
it
is
magnificent
of
me
to
have
gotten
so
far
at
the
age
of
nineteen
with
no
training
other
than
that
of
the
sand
and
barrenness
magnificent
do
you
hear
very
often
i
take
this
fact
in
my
hand
and
squeeze
it
hard
like
an
orange
to
get
the
sweet
sweet
juice
from
it
i
squeeze
a
great
deal
of
juice
from
it
every
day
and
every
day
the
juice
is
renewed
like
the
vitals
of
prometheus
and
so
i
squeeze
and
squeeze
and
drink
the
juice
and
try
to
be
satisfied
yes
you
may
gaze
long
and
curiously
at
the
portrait
in
the
front
of
this
book
it
is
of
one
who
is
a
genius
of
egotism
and
analysis
a
genius
who
is
awaiting
the
devil
s
coming
a
genius
with
a
wondrous
liver
within
i
shall
tell
you
more
about
this
liver
i
think
before
i
have
done
january
i
can
remember
a
time
long
oh
very
long
ago
that
is
the
time
when
i
was
a
child
it
is
ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago
or
is
it
a
thousand
years
ago
it
is
when
you
have
but
just
parted
from
your
friend
that
he
seems
farthest
from
you
when
i
have
lived
several
more
years
the
time
when
i
was
a
child
will
not
seem
so
far
behind
me
just
now
it
is
frightfully
far
away
it
is
so
far
away
that
i
can
see
it
plainly
outlined
on
the
horizon
it
is
there
always
for
me
to
look
at
and
when
i
look
i
can
feel
the
tears
deep
within
me
a
salt
ocean
of
tears
that
roll
and
surge
and
swell
bitterly
in
a
dull
mad
anguish
and
never
come
to
the
surface
i
do
not
know
which
is
the
more
weirdly
and
damnably
pathetic
i
when
i
was
a
child
or
i
when
i
am
grown
to
a
woman
young
and
all
alone
i
weigh
the
question
coldly
and
logically
but
my
logic
trembles
with
rage
and
grief
and
unhappiness
when
i
was
a
child
i
lived
in
canada
and
in
minnesota
i
was
a
little
wild
savage
in
minnesota
there
were
swamps
where
i
used
to
wet
my
feet
in
the
spring
and
there
were
fields
of
tall
grass
where
i
would
lie
flat
on
my
stomach
in
company
with
lizards
and
little
garter
snakes
and
there
were
poplar
leaves
that
turned
their
pale
green
backs
upward
on
a
hot
afternoon
and
soon
there
would
be
terrific
thunder
and
lightning
and
rain
and
there
were
robins
that
sang
at
dawn
these
things
stay
with
one
always
and
there
were
children
with
whom
i
used
to
play
and
fight
i
was
tanned
and
sunburned
and
i
had
an
unkempt
appearance
my
face
was
very
dirty
the
original
pattern
of
my
frock
was
invariably
lost
in
layers
and
vistas
of
the
native
soil
my
hair
was
braided
or
else
it
flew
about
a
tangled
maze
according
as
i
could
be
caught
by
some
one
and
rubbed
and
straightened
before
i
ran
away
for
the
day
my
hands
were
little
and
strong
and
brown
and
wrought
much
mischief
i
came
and
went
at
my
own
pleasure
i
ate
what
i
pleased
i
went
to
bed
all
in
my
own
good
time
i
tramped
wherever
my
stubborn
little
feet
chose
i
was
impudent
i
was
contrary
i
had
an
extremely
bad
temper
i
was
i
was
full
of
infantile
malice
truly
i
was
a
vicious
little
beast
i
was
a
little
piece
of
untrained
nature
and
i
am
unable
to
judge
which
is
the
more
savagely
forlorn
the
child
or
the
woman
young
and
all
alone
the
little
wild
stubborn
child
felt
things
and
wanted
things
she
did
not
know
that
she
felt
things
and
wanted
things
now
i
feel
and
i
want
things
and
i
know
it
with
burning
vividness
the
little
vicious
mary
maclane
suffered
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
suffered
yet
that
did
not
make
the
suffering
less
and
she
reached
out
with
a
little
sunburned
hand
to
touch
and
take
something
but
the
sunburned
little
hand
remained
empty
there
was
nothing
for
it
no
one
had
anything
to
put
into
it
the
little
wild
creature
wanted
to
be
loved
she
wanted
something
to
put
in
her
hungry
little
heart
but
no
one
had
anything
to
put
into
a
hungry
little
heart
no
one
said
the
little
vicious
child
was
the
only
maclane
and
she
felt
somewhat
alone
but
there
after
all
were
the
lizards
and
the
little
garter
snakes
the
wretched
hardened
little
piece
of
untrained
nature
has
grown
and
developed
into
a
woman
young
and
alone
for
the
child
there
was
a
nothingness
and
for
the
woman
there
is
a
great
nothingness
perhaps
the
devil
will
bring
me
something
in
my
lonely
womanhood
to
put
in
my
wooden
heart
but
the
time
when
i
was
a
child
will
never
come
again
it
is
gone
gone
i
may
live
through
some
long
long
years
but
nothing
like
it
will
ever
come
for
there
is
nothing
like
it
it
is
a
life
by
itself
it
has
naught
to
do
with
philosophy
or
with
genius
or
with
heights
and
depths
or
with
the
red
sunset
sky
or
with
the
devil
these
come
later
the
time
of
the
child
is
a
thing
apart
it
is
the
planting
and
it
is
the
beginning
of
things
it
decides
whether
there
shall
be
brightness
or
bitterness
in
the
long
i
have
left
that
time
far
enough
behind
me
it
will
never
come
back
and
it
had
a
nothingness
do
you
hear
a
oh
the
pity
of
it
the
pity
of
it
do
you
know
why
it
is
that
i
look
back
to
the
horizon
at
the
figure
of
an
unkempt
rough
child
and
why
i
feel
a
surging
torrent
of
tears
and
anguish
and
despair
i
feel
more
than
that
indeed
but
i
have
no
words
to
tell
it
i
shall
have
to
miss
forever
some
beautiful
wonderful
things
because
of
that
wretched
lonely
childhood
there
will
always
be
a
lacking
a
wanting
some
dead
branches
that
never
grew
leaves
it
is
not
deaths
and
murders
and
plots
and
wars
that
make
life
tragedy
it
is
nothing
that
makes
life
tragedy
it
is
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
and
nothing
it
is
a
sunburned
little
hand
reached
out
and
nothing
put
into
it
january
i
sit
at
my
window
and
look
out
upon
the
housetops
and
chimneys
of
butte
as
i
look
i
have
a
weary
disgusted
feeling
people
are
abominable
creatures
under
each
of
the
roofs
live
a
man
and
woman
joined
together
by
that
very
slender
thread
the
marriage
ceremony
and
their
children
the
result
of
the
marriage
ceremony
how
many
of
them
love
each
other
not
two
in
a
hundred
i
warrant
the
marriage
ceremony
is
their
one
miserable
petty
paltry
excuse
for
living
together
this
marriage
rite
it
appears
is
often
used
as
a
cloak
to
cover
a
world
of
rather
shameful
things
how
virtuous
these
people
are
to
be
sure
under
their
different
so
virtuous
are
they
indeed
that
they
are
able
to
draw
themselves
up
in
the
pride
of
their
own
purity
when
they
happen
upon
some
corner
where
the
marriage
ceremony
is
lacking
so
virtuous
are
they
that
the
men
can
afford
to
find
amusement
and
diversion
in
the
woes
of
the
corner
that
is
without
the
marriage
rite
and
the
women
may
draw
away
their
skirts
in
shocked
horror
and
wonder
that
such
things
can
be
in
view
of
their
own
spotless
virtue
and
so
they
live
on
under
the
roofs
and
they
eat
and
work
and
sleep
and
die
and
the
children
grow
up
and
seek
other
roofs
and
call
upon
the
marriage
ceremony
even
as
their
parents
before
them
and
then
they
likewise
eat
and
work
and
sleep
and
die
and
so
on
world
without
end
this
also
is
life
the
life
of
the
good
virtuous
christians
i
think
therefore
that
i
should
prefer
some
life
that
is
not
virtuous
i
shall
never
make
use
of
the
marriage
ceremony
i
hereby
register
a
vow
devil
to
that
effect
when
a
man
and
a
woman
love
one
another
that
is
enough
that
is
marriage
a
religious
rite
is
superfluous
and
if
the
man
and
woman
live
together
without
the
love
no
ceremony
in
the
world
can
make
it
marriage
the
woman
who
does
this
need
not
feel
the
tiniest
bit
better
than
her
lowest
sister
in
the
streets
is
she
not
indeed
a
step
lower
since
she
pretends
to
be
what
she
is
not
plays
the
virtuous
woman
while
the
other
unfortunate
pretends
nothing
she
wears
her
name
on
her
sleeve
if
i
were
obliged
to
be
one
of
these
i
would
rather
be
she
who
wears
her
name
on
her
sleeve
i
certainly
would
the
lesser
of
two
evils
always
i
can
think
of
nothing
in
the
world
like
the
utter
littleness
the
paltriness
the
contemptibleness
the
degradation
of
the
woman
who
is
tied
down
under
a
roof
with
a
man
who
is
really
nothing
to
her
who
wears
the
man
s
name
who
bears
the
man
s
children
who
plays
the
virtuous
woman
there
are
too
many
such
in
the
world
now
may
i
never
i
say
become
that
abnormal
merciless
animal
that
deformed
monstrosity
a
virtuous
woman
anything
devil
but
that
and
so
as
i
look
out
over
the
roofs
and
chimneys
i
have
a
weary
disgusted
feeling
january
this
is
not
a
diary
it
is
a
portrayal
it
is
my
inner
life
shown
in
its
nakedness
i
am
trying
my
utmost
to
show
everything
to
reveal
every
petty
vanity
and
weakness
every
phase
of
feeling
every
desire
it
is
a
remarkably
hard
thing
to
do
i
find
to
probe
my
soul
to
its
depths
to
expose
its
shades
and
not
that
i
am
troubled
with
modesty
or
shame
why
should
one
be
ashamed
of
anything
but
there
are
elements
in
one
s
mental
equipment
so
vague
so
opaque
so
undefined
how
is
one
to
grasp
them
i
have
analyzed
and
analyzed
and
i
have
gotten
down
to
some
extremely
fine
points
yet
still
there
are
things
upon
my
own
horizon
that
go
beyond
me
there
are
feelings
that
rise
and
rush
over
me
overwhelmingly
i
am
helpless
crushed
and
defeated
before
them
it
is
as
if
they
were
written
on
the
walls
of
my
in
an
unknown
language
my
soul
goes
blindly
seeking
seeking
asking
nothing
answers
i
cry
out
after
some
unknown
thing
with
all
the
strength
of
my
being
every
nerve
and
fiber
in
my
young
woman
and
my
young
woman
reaches
and
strains
in
anguished
unrest
at
times
as
i
hurry
over
my
sand
and
barrenness
all
my
life
s
manifold
passions
culminate
in
utter
rage
and
woe
waves
of
intense
hopeless
longing
rush
over
me
and
envelop
me
round
and
round
my
heart
my
soul
my
mind
go
wandering
wandering
ploughing
their
way
through
darkness
with
never
a
ray
of
light
groping
with
helpless
hands
asking
longing
wanting
things
pursued
by
a
demon
of
unrest
i
shall
go
mad
i
shall
go
mad
i
say
over
and
over
to
myself
but
no
no
one
goes
mad
the
devil
does
not
propose
to
release
any
one
from
a
so
artistic
damnation
he
looks
to
it
that
one
s
senses
are
kept
fully
intact
and
he
fastens
to
them
with
steel
chains
the
demon
of
unrest
it
hurts
oh
it
tortures
me
in
the
days
and
days
but
when
the
devil
brings
me
my
happiness
i
will
forgive
him
all
this
when
my
happiness
is
given
me
the
unrest
will
still
be
with
me
i
doubt
not
but
the
happiness
will
change
the
tenor
of
it
will
make
it
an
instrument
of
joy
will
clasp
hands
with
it
and
mingle
itself
with
it
the
while
i
with
my
wooden
heart
my
woman
my
mind
my
soul
shall
be
in
transports
i
shall
be
filled
with
pleasure
so
deep
and
pain
so
intense
that
my
being
s
minutest
nerve
will
reel
and
stagger
in
intoxication
will
go
drunk
with
the
fullness
of
life
when
my
happiness
is
given
me
i
shall
live
centuries
in
the
hours
and
we
shall
all
grow
old
rapidly
i
and
my
wooden
heart
and
my
woman
and
my
mind
and
my
soul
sorrow
may
age
one
in
some
degree
but
happiness
the
real
happiness
rolls
countless
years
off
from
one
s
in
a
single
moment
and
each
year
leaves
its
impress
it
is
true
that
life
is
a
tragedy
to
those
who
feel
when
my
happiness
is
given
me
life
will
be
an
ineffable
a
nameless
thing
it
will
seethe
and
roar
it
will
plunge
and
whirl
it
will
leap
and
shriek
in
convulsion
it
will
guiver
in
delicate
fantasy
it
will
writhe
and
twist
it
will
glitter
and
flash
and
shine
it
will
sing
gently
it
will
shout
in
exquisite
excitement
it
will
vibrate
to
the
roots
like
a
great
oak
in
a
storm
it
will
dance
it
will
glide
it
will
gallop
it
will
rush
it
will
swell
and
surge
it
will
fly
it
will
soar
high
high
it
will
go
down
into
depths
unexplored
it
will
rage
and
rave
it
will
yell
in
utter
joy
it
will
melt
it
will
blaze
it
will
ride
triumphant
it
will
grovel
in
the
dust
of
entire
pleasure
it
will
sound
out
like
a
terrific
blare
of
trumpets
it
will
chime
faintly
faintly
like
the
remote
tinkling
notes
of
a
harp
it
will
sob
and
grieve
and
weep
it
will
revel
and
carouse
it
will
shrink
it
will
go
in
pride
it
will
lie
prone
like
the
dead
it
will
float
buoyantly
on
air
it
will
moan
shiver
burst
oh
it
will
reek
with
love
and
light
the
words
of
the
english
language
are
futile
there
are
no
words
in
it
or
in
any
other
to
express
an
idea
of
that
thing
which
would
be
my
life
in
its
happiness
the
words
i
have
written
describe
it
it
is
true
but
confusedly
and
inadequately
but
words
are
for
everyday
use
when
it
comes
my
turn
to
meet
face
to
face
the
unspeakable
vision
of
the
happy
life
i
shall
be
rendered
dumb
but
the
rains
of
my
feeling
will
come
in
torrents
january
i
am
an
artist
of
the
most
artistic
the
highest
type
i
have
uncovered
for
myself
the
art
that
lies
in
obscure
shadows
i
have
discovered
the
art
of
the
day
of
small
things
and
that
surely
is
art
with
a
capital
i
have
acquired
the
art
of
good
eating
usually
it
is
in
the
gray
and
elderly
forties
and
fifties
that
people
cultivate
this
art
if
they
ever
do
it
is
indeed
a
rare
art
but
i
know
it
in
all
its
rare
exquisiteness
at
the
young
slim
age
of
nineteen
which
is
one
more
mark
of
my
genius
do
you
see
the
art
of
good
eating
has
two
essential
points
one
must
eat
only
when
one
is
hungry
and
one
must
take
small
bites
there
are
persons
who
eat
for
the
sake
of
eating
they
are
gourmands
and
partake
of
the
natures
of
the
pig
and
the
buzzard
there
are
persons
who
take
bites
that
are
not
small
these
also
are
gourmands
and
partake
of
the
natures
of
the
pig
and
the
buzzard
there
are
persons
who
can
enjoy
nothing
in
the
way
of
eating
except
a
luxurious
meal
these
it
is
safe
to
say
have
not
acquired
the
art
of
anything
but
i
i
have
acquired
the
art
of
eating
an
olive
now
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
the
art
of
eating
an
olive
i
take
the
olive
in
my
fingers
and
i
contemplate
its
green
oval
richness
it
makes
me
think
at
once
of
the
land
where
the
green
citron
grows
where
the
cypress
and
myrtle
are
emblems
of
the
land
of
the
sun
where
human
beings
are
delightfully
enchantingly
wicked
where
the
men
are
eager
and
passionate
and
the
women
gracefully
developed
in
mind
and
in
body
and
their
two
breasts
show
round
and
full
and
delicately
veined
beneath
thin
drapery
the
mere
sight
of
the
olive
conjures
up
this
charming
picture
in
my
mind
i
set
my
teeth
and
my
tongue
upon
the
olive
and
bite
it
it
is
bitter
salt
delicious
the
saliva
rushes
to
meet
it
and
my
tongue
is
a
happy
tongue
as
the
morsel
of
olive
rests
in
my
mouth
and
is
crunched
and
squeezed
lusciously
among
my
teeth
a
quick
temporary
change
takes
place
in
my
character
i
think
of
some
adorable
lines
of
the
persian
poet
give
thyself
up
to
joy
for
thy
grief
will
be
infinite
the
stars
shall
again
meet
together
at
the
same
point
in
the
firmament
but
of
thy
body
shall
bricks
be
made
for
a
palace
oh
dear
sweet
bitter
olive
i
say
to
myself
the
bit
of
olive
slips
down
my
red
gullet
and
so
into
my
stomach
there
it
meets
with
a
joyous
welcome
gastric
juices
leap
out
from
the
walls
and
swathe
it
in
loving
embrace
my
stomach
is
fond
of
something
bitter
and
salt
it
lavishes
flattery
and
endearment
galore
upon
the
olive
it
laughs
in
silent
delight
it
feels
that
the
day
it
has
long
waited
for
has
come
the
philosophy
of
my
stomach
is
wholly
epicurean
let
it
receive
but
a
tiny
bit
of
olive
and
it
will
reck
not
of
the
morrow
nor
of
the
past
it
lives
voluptuously
in
the
present
it
is
content
it
is
in
paradise
i
bite
the
olive
again
again
the
bitter
salt
crisp
ravishes
my
tongue
if
this
be
vanity
vanity
let
it
the
golden
moments
flit
by
and
i
heed
them
not
for
am
i
not
comfortably
seated
and
eating
an
olive
go
hang
yourself
you
who
have
never
been
comfortably
seated
and
eating
an
olive
my
character
evolves
farther
in
its
change
i
am
now
bent
on
reckless
sensuality
let
happen
what
will
the
fair
earth
seems
to
resolve
itself
into
a
thing
oval
and
crisp
and
good
and
green
and
deliciously
salt
i
experience
a
feeling
of
fervent
gladness
that
i
am
a
female
thing
living
and
that
i
have
a
tongue
and
some
teeth
and
salivary
glands
also
this
bit
slips
down
my
red
gullet
and
again
the
festive
stomach
lifts
up
a
silent
voice
in
psalms
and
rejoicing
it
is
now
an
absolute
monarchy
with
the
green
olive
at
its
head
the
kisses
of
the
gastric
juice
become
hot
and
sensual
and
convulsive
and
ecstatic
avaunt
pale
shadowy
ghosts
of
dyspepsia
says
my
stomach
i
know
you
not
i
am
of
a
brilliant
shining
world
i
dwell
in
elysian
once
more
i
bite
the
olive
once
more
is
my
tongue
electrified
and
the
third
stage
in
my
temporary
transformation
takes
place
i
am
now
a
gross
but
supremely
contented
sensualist
an
exquisite
symphony
of
sensualism
and
pleasure
seems
to
play
somewhere
within
me
my
heart
purrs
my
brain
folds
its
arms
and
lounges
i
put
my
feet
up
on
the
seat
of
another
chair
the
entire
world
is
now
surely
one
delicious
green
olive
my
mind
is
capable
of
conceiving
but
one
idea
that
of
a
green
olive
therefore
the
green
olive
is
a
perfect
thing
absolutely
a
perfect
thing
disgust
and
disapproval
are
excited
only
by
imperfections
when
a
thing
is
perfect
no
matter
how
hard
one
may
look
at
it
one
can
see
only
itself
itself
and
nothing
beyond
and
so
i
have
made
my
olive
and
my
art
perfect
well
then
this
third
bit
of
olive
slides
down
the
willing
gullet
into
my
stomach
and
then
my
heart
with
pleasure
the
play
of
the
gastric
secretions
is
now
marvelous
it
is
the
meeting
of
the
waters
it
were
well
ah
how
well
if
the
hearts
of
the
world
could
mingle
in
peace
as
the
gastric
juices
mingle
at
the
coming
of
a
green
olive
into
my
stomach
paradise
paradise
says
my
stomach
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
passionate
veins
is
resting
through
my
stomach
my
do
you
hear
my
soul
seems
to
feel
the
infinite
the
minutes
are
flying
shortly
it
will
be
over
but
just
now
i
am
safe
i
am
entirely
satisfied
i
want
nothing
nothing
my
inner
quiet
is
infinite
i
am
conscious
that
it
is
but
momentary
and
it
matters
not
on
the
contrary
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
renders
the
present
quiet
the
repose
more
limitless
more
intense
where
now
devil
is
your
damnation
if
this
be
damnation
damnation
let
it
be
if
this
be
the
human
fall
then
how
good
it
is
to
be
fallen
at
this
moment
i
would
fain
my
fall
were
like
yours
lucifer
never
to
hope
and
so
bite
by
bite
the
olive
enters
into
my
body
and
soul
each
bite
brings
with
it
a
recurring
wave
of
sensation
and
charm
no
we
will
not
dispute
with
the
brilliant
mind
that
declared
life
a
tragedy
to
those
who
feel
we
will
let
that
stand
however
there
are
parts
of
the
tragedy
that
are
not
tragic
there
are
parts
that
admit
of
a
turning
aside
as
the
years
pass
one
after
another
i
shall
continue
to
eat
and
as
i
eat
i
shall
have
my
quiet
my
brief
period
of
aberration
this
is
the
art
of
eating
i
have
acquired
it
by
means
of
analyzing
analyzing
analyzing
truly
my
genius
is
analytical
and
it
enables
me
to
endure
if
also
to
feel
bitterly
the
heavy
heavy
weight
of
life
what
a
worm
of
misery
i
should
be
were
it
not
for
these
bursts
of
philosophy
these
turnings
aside
if
it
please
the
devil
one
day
i
may
have
happiness
that
will
be
i
shall
then
analyze
no
more
i
shall
be
a
different
being
but
meanwhile
i
shall
eat
when
the
last
of
the
olive
vanishes
into
the
stomach
when
it
is
there
reduced
to
animated
chyme
when
i
play
with
the
in
my
fingers
when
i
lean
back
in
my
chair
and
straighten
out
my
spinal
column
oh
then
do
you
not
envy
me
you
fine
brave
world
who
are
not
a
philosopher
who
have
not
discovered
the
art
of
the
small
things
who
have
not
conscious
chyme
in
your
stomach
who
have
not
acquired
the
art
of
good
eating
january
as
i
read
over
now
and
then
what
i
have
written
of
my
portrayal
i
have
alternate
periods
of
hope
and
despair
at
times
i
think
i
am
succeeding
admirably
and
again
what
i
have
written
compared
to
what
i
have
felt
seems
vapid
and
tame
who
has
not
felt
the
futility
of
words
when
one
would
express
feelings
i
take
this
hope
and
despair
as
another
mark
of
genius
genius
apart
from
natural
sensitiveness
is
prone
equally
to
unreasoning
joy
and
to
bitterest
morbidness
i
am
more
than
fond
of
writing
though
i
have
hours
when
i
can
not
write
any
more
than
i
could
paint
a
picture
or
play
wagner
as
it
should
be
played
i
think
my
style
of
writing
has
a
wonderful
intensity
in
it
and
it
is
admirably
suited
to
the
creature
it
portrays
what
sort
of
portrayal
of
myself
would
i
produce
if
i
wrote
with
the
long
elaborate
periods
of
henry
james
or
with
the
pleasant
ladylike
phrasing
of
howells
it
would
be
rather
like
a
little
tin
phonograph
trolling
out
flowery
poetry
at
breakneck
speed
or
like
a
church
organ
pouring
forth
eyes
with
ponderous
feeling
when
i
read
a
book
i
study
it
carefully
to
find
whether
the
author
and
whether
i
could
with
the
same
subject
write
a
better
one
myself
the
latter
question
i
usually
decide
in
the
affirmative
the
highest
thing
one
can
do
in
literature
is
to
succeed
in
saying
that
thing
which
one
meant
to
say
there
is
nothing
better
than
that
to
make
the
world
see
your
thoughts
as
you
see
them
eugene
field
and
edgar
allan
poe
and
robert
louis
stevenson
and
charles
dickens
among
others
have
succeeded
in
doing
this
they
impress
the
world
with
a
sense
of
their
courage
and
realness
there
are
people
who
have
written
books
which
did
not
impress
the
world
in
this
way
but
which
nevertheless
came
out
of
the
feeling
and
fullness
of
zealous
hearts
always
i
think
of
that
pathetic
artless
little
thing
jane
eyre
as
a
picture
shown
to
a
world
seeing
with
distorted
vision
charlotte
bronté
meant
one
thing
when
she
wrote
the
book
and
the
world
after
a
time
suddenly
understood
a
quite
different
thing
and
heaped
praise
and
applause
upon
her
therefor
when
i
read
the
book
i
was
not
quite
able
to
see
just
what
the
message
was
that
the
bronté
intended
to
send
out
but
i
saw
that
there
was
a
message
of
bravery
perhaps
or
of
that
good
which
may
come
out
of
nazareth
but
the
world
that
praised
and
applauded
and
gave
her
money
seems
totally
to
have
missed
it
it
takes
centuries
of
tears
and
piety
and
mourning
to
move
this
world
a
tiny
bit
but
still
it
will
give
you
praise
and
applause
and
money
if
you
will
prostitute
your
sensibilities
and
emotions
for
the
gratification
of
it
i
have
no
message
to
hide
in
a
book
and
send
out
i
am
writing
a
portrayal
but
a
portrayal
is
also
a
thing
that
may
be
misunderstood
january
an
idle
brain
is
the
devil
s
workshop
they
say
it
is
an
absurdly
incongruous
statement
if
the
devil
is
at
work
in
a
brain
it
certainly
is
not
idle
and
when
one
considers
how
brilliant
a
personage
the
devil
is
and
what
very
fine
work
he
turns
out
it
becomes
an
open
question
whether
he
would
have
the
slightest
use
for
most
of
the
idle
brains
that
cumber
the
earth
but
after
all
the
devil
is
so
clever
that
he
could
produce
unexcelled
workmanship
with
even
the
poorest
tools
my
brain
is
one
kind
of
devil
s
workshop
and
it
is
as
incessantly
and
a
one
as
you
could
imagine
it
is
a
devil
s
workshop
indeed
only
i
do
the
work
myself
but
there
is
a
mental
telegraphy
between
the
devil
and
me
which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
many
of
my
ideas
are
so
wonderfully
groomed
and
perfumed
and
colored
i
take
no
credit
to
myself
for
this
though
as
i
say
i
do
the
work
myself
i
try
always
to
give
the
devil
his
due
and
particularly
in
this
portrayal
there
are
very
few
who
give
the
devil
his
due
in
this
world
of
hypocrites
i
never
think
of
the
devil
as
that
atrocious
creature
in
red
tights
with
cloven
hoofs
and
a
tail
and
a
fork
i
think
of
him
rather
as
an
extremely
fascinating
strong
person
in
conventional
clothes
a
man
with
whom
to
fall
completely
madly
in
love
i
rather
think
i
believe
that
he
is
incarnate
at
times
why
not
periodically
i
fall
completely
madly
in
love
with
the
devil
he
is
so
fascinating
so
strong
so
strong
exactly
the
sort
of
man
whom
my
wooden
heart
awaits

sweet

rarely
sweet
the
devil

say
and
i
will
be
in
transports
oh
devil
devil
devil
oh
misery
of
nothingness
the
days
are
long
long
and
very
weary
as
i
await
the
devil
s
coming
january
as
i
walked
out
i
was
impressed
deeply
with
the
wonderful
beautifulness
of
nature
even
in
her
barrenness
the
mountains
had
that
high
pure
transparent
look
and
the
nearer
ones
were
transformed
completely
with
a
wistful
beseeching
attitude
that
reminded
me
of
my
life
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
as
the
sun
lowered
the
pure
lavender
of
the
hills
was
tinted
with
and
the
gray
of
the
nearer
ones
with
and
the
sand
my
sand
and
barrenness
almost
flushed
consciously
in
its
wide
mysterious
magnitude
in
the
sky
there
was
a
white
cloud
the
sky
was
blue
blue
almost
as
when
i
was
a
child
the
air
was
very
gentle
the
earth
seemed
softened
there
was
an
indefinite
caressing
something
over
all
that
went
into
my
soul
and
stirred
it
and
hurt
it
there
was
that
in
the
air
which
is
there
when
something
is
going
to
happen
only
nothing
ever
happens
it
is
rare
i
thought
that
my
sand
and
barrenness
looks
like
this
i
crouched
on
the
ground
and
the
wondrous
calm
and
beauty
of
the
natural
things
awed
and
moved
me
with
strange
still
emotions
i
felt
and
gazed
about
me
and
felt
again
and
everything
was
very
still
presently
my
eyes
filled
quietly
with
tears
i
bent
my
head
into
the
breast
of
a
great
gray
rock
oh
my
soul
my
soul
i
said
over
and
over
not
with
passion
it
is
so
divine
the
earth
is
so
beautiful
so
untainted
and
i
what
am
i
it
was
so
beautiful
that
now
as
i
write
and
it
comes
over
me
again
i
can
not
restrain
the
tears
tears
are
not
common
i
felt
my
wooden
heart
my
soul
quivering
and
sobbing
with
their
unknown
wanting
this
is
my
soul
s
awakening
ah
the
pain
of
my
soul
s
awakening
is
there
nothing
to
help
this
pain
i
am
so
lonely
so
lonely
fannie
corbin
my
one
friend
my
anemone
lady
i
want
you
so
much
why
aren
t
you
here
i
want
to
feel
your
hand
with
mine
as
i
felt
it
sometimes
before
you
went
away
you
are
the
only
one
among
a
worldful
of
people
to
care
a
little
and
i
love
you
with
all
the
strength
and
worship
i
can
give
to
the
things
that
are
beautiful
and
true
you
are
the
only
one
the
only
one
and
my
soul
is
full
of
pain
and
i
am
sitting
alone
on
the
ground
and
my
head
lies
on
a
rock
s
strange
sweet
passions
stirred
and
waked
somewhere
deep
within
me
as
i
sat
shivering
on
the
ground
and
i
felt
them
singing
far
away
as
if
their
faint
voices
came
out
of
that
limitless
deep
deep
blue
above
me
and
it
was
like
a
choir
of
and
they
sang
of
love
and
of
light
and
of
dear
tender
dreams
and
of
my
soul
s
awakening
why
is
this
and
what
is
it
that
is
hurting
so
is
it
because
i
am
young
or
is
it
because
i
am
alone
or
because
i
am
a
woman
oh
it
is
a
hard
and
bitter
thing
to
be
a
woman
and
why
why
is
woman
so
foul
a
creature
that
she
must
needs
be
purged
by
this
infinite
pain
the
choir
of
faint
sweet
voices
comes
to
me
incessantly
out
of
the
blue
my
wooden
heart
and
my
soul
are
listening
to
them
intently
the
voices
are
trying
hard
to
tell
me
to
help
me
but
i
can
not
understand
i
know
only
that
it
is
about
pure
exalted
things
and
about
the
love
that
is
somewhere
and
it
is
about
the
and
about
truth
but
i
can
not
understand
and
the
voices
sing
of
me
the
child
a
song
of
the
unloved
starved
little
being
and
a
song
of
the
unloved
creature
and
a
song
of
me
a
woman
and
all
alone
awaiting
the
devil
s
coming
oh
my
soul
my
soul
a
female
snake
is
born
out
of
its
mother
s
white
egg
and
lives
awhile
in
content
among
weeds
and
grass
and
dies
a
female
dog
lives
some
years
and
has
bones
thrown
at
her
and
sometimes
she
receives
a
kick
or
a
blow
and
a
to
sleep
in
and
dies
a
female
bird
has
a
nest
and
worms
to
eat
and
goes
south
in
the
winter
and
presently
she
dies
a
female
toad
has
a
swamp
or
a
garden
some
bugs
and
flies
contentment
and
then
she
dies
and
each
of
these
has
a
male
thing
with
her
for
a
time
and
soon
there
are
little
snakes
or
little
dogs
for
her
to
love
as
much
as
it
is
given
her
to
love
she
can
do
no
more
and
they
are
fortunate
with
their
little
snakes
and
little
dogs
a
female
human
being
is
born
out
of
her
mother
s
fair
body
branded
with
a
strange
name
and
let
go
and
lives
awhile
and
dies
but
before
she
dies
she
awakes
there
is
a
pain
that
goes
with
it
and
the
male
thing
that
is
with
her
for
a
time
is
unlike
a
snake
or
a
dog
it
is
more
like
a
man
and
there
is
another
pain
for
this
and
when
a
little
human
being
comes
with
a
soul
of
its
own
there
must
be
another
awakening
for
she
has
then
reached
the
best
and
highest
state
that
any
human
being
can
reach
though
she
is
a
female
human
being
and
and
here
also
there
is
heavy
the
name
the
name
branded
upon
her
means
woman
i
lifted
my
head
from
the
breast
of
the
gray
rock
the
tears
had
been
falling
falling
tears
are
so
strange
tears
from
the
fountain
of
nineteen
years
are
like
drops
of
water
wrung
out
of
stone
suddenly
i
got
up
from
the
ground
and
ran
quickly
over
the
sand
for
several
minutes
i
did
not
dare
look
again
at
the
hilltops
and
the
deep
blue
nor
listen
again
to
the
voices
oh
with
it
all
i
am
a
coward
i
shrink
and
cringe
before
the
pain
of
the
dazzling
lights
yet
i
am
waiting
longing
for
the
most
dazzling
light
of
all
the
coming
of
the
devil
february
oh
the
wretched
bitter
loneliness
of
me
in
all
the
deep
darkness
and
the
silence
there
is
never
a
faint
human
light
never
a
voice
how
can
i
bear
it
how
can
i
bear
it
february
i
have
been
looking
over
the
confessions
of
the
bashkirtseff
they
are
indeed
rather
like
my
portrayal
but
they
are
not
so
interesting
nor
so
intense
i
have
a
stronger
individuality
than
marie
bashkirtseff
though
her
mind
was
probably
in
a
higher
state
of
development
than
mine
even
when
she
was
younger
than
i
most
of
her
emotions
are
vacillating
and
inconsistent
she
worships
a
god
one
day
and
blasphemes
him
the
next
she
never
loves
her
god
and
why
then
does
she
have
a
god
why
does
she
not
abandon
him
altogether
he
seems
to
be
of
no
use
to
her
except
as
a
convenient
thing
on
which
to
fasten
the
blame
for
her
and
after
all
that
is
something
very
useful
and
she
loves
the
people
about
her
one
day
and
the
next
day
she
hates
them
but
in
her
great
passion
her
ambition
marie
bashkirtseff
was
beautifully
consistent
and
what
terrific
storms
of
woe
and
despair
must
have
enveloped
her
when
she
knew
that
within
a
certain
period
she
would
be
dead
removed
from
the
world
and
her
work
left
undone
the
time
kept
creeping
nearer
she
must
have
tasted
the
bitterness
of
death
indeed
she
was
sure
of
success
sure
that
her
ambition
would
be
gratified
to
its
last
vestige
and
then
to
die
it
was
certainly
hard
lines
for
the
little
bashkirtseff
my
own
despair
is
of
an
opposite
nature
there
is
one
thing
in
the
world
that
is
more
bitter
than
death
and
that
is
life
suppose
that
i
learned
i
was
to
die
on
the
of
june
for
instance
it
would
give
me
a
soft
warm
wave
of
pleasure
i
think
i
might
be
in
the
depths
of
woe
at
the
time
my
despair
might
be
the
despair
of
despair
my
misery
utterly
unceasing
and
i
could
say
never
mind
on
the
of
june
all
will
be
over
dull
misery
rage
nothingness
obscurity
the
unknown
longing
every
desire
of
my
soul
all
the
pain
ended
inevitably
completely
on
the
of
june
i
might
come
upon
a
new
pain
but
this
my
long
old
torture
would
cease
you
may
say
that
i
might
end
my
life
on
that
day
that
i
might
do
so
now
i
certainly
shall
if
the
pain
becomes
greater
than
i
can
bear
for
what
else
is
there
to
do
but
i
shall
be
far
from
satisfied
in
doing
so
what
if
i
were
to
end
everything
now
when
perhaps
the
devil
may
be
coming
to
me
in
two
years
time
with
happiness
upon
dying
it
might
be
that
i
should
go
to
some
wondrous
fair
country
where
there
would
be
trees
and
running
water
and
a
well
oh
well
but
i
want
the
earthly
happiness
i
am
not
and
spiritual
i
am
earthly
human
sensitive
sensuous
sensual
and
ah
dear
my
soul
wants
its
earthly
happiness
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
the
point
of
suicide
while
there
is
a
possibility
of
happiness
remaining
but
if
i
knew
that
irrevocable
inevitable
death
awaited
me
on
june
i
should
be
satisfied
my
happiness
might
come
before
that
time
or
it
might
not
i
should
be
satisfied
i
should
know
that
my
life
was
out
of
my
hands
i
should
know
above
all
that
my
long
long
old
old
pain
of
loneliness
would
stop
june
i
shall
die
naturally
some
day
probably
after
i
have
grown
old
and
sour
if
i
have
had
my
happiness
for
a
year
or
a
day
well
and
good
i
shall
be
content
to
grow
as
old
and
as
sour
as
the
devil
wills
but
having
had
no
happiness
if
i
find
myself
growing
old
and
still
no
happiness
oh
then
i
vow
i
will
not
live
another
hour
even
if
dying
were
rushing
headlong
to
damnation
i
am
do
you
see
a
philosopher
and
a
coward
with
the
philosophy
of
cowardice
i
squeeze
juice
also
from
this
fact
sometimes
but
the
juice
is
not
sweet
juice
the
devil
the
fascinating
it
may
be
is
coming
coming
coming
and
meanwhile
i
go
on
and
on
in
the
midst
of
sand
and
barrenness
february
the
town
of
butte
presents
a
wonderful
field
to
a
student
of
humanity
and
human
nature
there
are
not
a
great
many
people
seventy
thousand
perhaps
but
those
seventy
thousand
are
in
their
way
unparalleled
for
mixture
for
miscellany
variedness
bohemianism
where
is
butte
s
rival
the
population
is
not
only
of
all
nationalities
and
stations
but
the
nationalities
and
stations
mix
and
mingle
promiscuously
with
each
other
and
are
partly
concealed
and
partly
revealed
in
the
mazes
of
a
veneer
that
belongs
neither
to
nation
nor
to
station
but
to
butte
the
nationalities
are
many
it
is
true
but
irish
and
cornish
predominate
my
acquaintance
extends
widely
among
the
inhabitants
of
butte
sometimes
when
i
feel
in
the
mood
for
it
i
spend
an
afternoon
in
visiting
about
among
divers
curious
people
at
some
fourth
of
july
demonstration
or
on
a
miners
union
day
the
heterogeneous
herd
turns
out
and
i
turn
out
with
the
herd
and
of
it
and
meditate
and
look
on
there
are
irishmen
kelleys
caseys
calahans
staggering
under
the
weight
of
much
whiskey
shouting
out
their
maxims
there
is
the
festive
cornishman
ogling
and
leering
greeting
his
with
alcoholic
heartiness
and
gazing
after
every
feminine
creature
with
lustful
eyes
there
are
irish
women
swearing
genially
at
each
other
in
shrill
pleasantry
and
five
or
six
children
for
each
there
are
cornish
women
likewise
each
with
her
train
of
children
there
are
suave
sleek
sporting
men
just
out
of
the
insignificant
lawyers
dentists
messengerboys
plungers
without
number
greasy
italians
from
meaderville
greasier
french
people
from
the
boulevarde
addition
ancient
miners
each
of
whom
was
the
first
to
stake
a
claim
in
butte
chinamen
here
and
there
a
contingent
of
finns
and
swedes
and
germans
musty
stuffy
old
jew
who
have
crawled
out
of
their
holes
for
a
brief
recreation
indians
and
squaws
in
dirty
gay
blankets
from
their
camp
below
the
town
who
are
as
common
in
butte
as
in
ireland
swell
africans
respectable
women
with
white
aprons
tied
around
their
waists
and
on
their
heads
who
have
left
the
children
at
home
and
stepped
out
to
see
what
was
going
on
innumerable
stray
youngsters
from
the
dark
haunts
of
dublin
gulch
heavy
with
toothpicks
in
their
mouths
a
vast
army
of
clerks
the
gentry
miners
of
every
description
representatives
from
dog
town
chicken
flats
busterville
butchertown
and
seldom
seen
suburbs
of
butte
pale
thin
individuals
who
sing
and
dance
in
smart
society
people
in
high
traps
and
impossible
women
though
in
butte
no
one
is
more
possible
in
vast
hats
and
extremely
plaid
stockings
persons
who
take
things
seriously
and
play
the
races
for
a
living
mexicans
and
arabians
the
dregs
the
élite
the
humbly
respectable
the
all
thrown
together
and
shaken
up
and
mixed
well
one
may
notice
many
odd
bits
of
irony
as
one
walks
among
these
one
may
notice
that
the
irishmen
are
singularly
carefree
and
strong
and
comfortable
and
so
jolly
while
the
irish
women
are
frumpish
and
careworn
and
borne
earthward
with
children
the
cornishman
who
has
consumed
the
greatest
amount
of
whiskey
is
the
most
agreeable
and
less
and
less
inclined
to
leer
and
ogle
the
cornish
woman
whose
profanity
is
the
shrillest
and
most
genial
and
voluble
is
she
whose
life
seems
the
most
weighted
and

whose
bodies
are
encased

stiffest
corsets

in
the
most
wildly
hilarious
spirits
of
all
the
filthy
little
irish
youngsters
from
dublin

are
much
brighter
and
more

in

of
the

are
they
whose
countenances
bear
various
scars
and
scratches
commemorating
late
evening
orgies
at

that
the
peculiar
solid
appearance
of
some
of
the
miners
wives
is
due
quite
as
much
to
the
quantity
of
beer
they
drink
as
to
their
annual
maternity

the
one

ruling

of

is
curiosity
that
the

is
warped
distorted
barren

lived
its
life
in

a
single
street
in
butte
contains
people
in
nearly
every
walk
of
life
living
side
by
side
resignedly
if
not
in
peace
in
a
row
of
five
or
six
houses
there
will
be
living
miners
and
their
families
the
children
of
which
prevent
life
from
stagnating
in
the
street
while
their
mothers
talk
to
each
other
with
the
inevitable
profanity
over
the
on
the
corner
above
there
will
be
a
mysterious
widow
with
one
child
who
has
suddenly
alighted
upon
the
neighborhood
stealthily
in
the
night
and
is
to
be
seen
at
rare
intervals
emerging
from
her
door
the
target
for
dozens
of
pairs
of
eager
eyes
and
half
as
many
eager
tongues
and
when
the
mysterious
widow
with
her
one
child
disappears
some
night
as
suddenly
and
as
stealthily
as
she
appeared
an
outburst
of
rumors
is
tossed
with
astonishing
glibness
over
the
various
all
relating
to
the
mysterious
widow
s
shady
antecedents
and
past
history
to
those
of
her
child
and
to
the
cause
of
her
sudden
departure
no
two
of
which
rumors
agree
in
any
particular
across
on
the
opposite
corner
there
will
be
a
company
of
strange
people
who
also
descended
suddenly
and
upon
whom
the
eyes
of
the
entire
block
are
turned
with
absorbing
interest
they
consist
of
men
and
women
seemingly
bound
together
only
by
ties
of
conviviality
the
house
is
kept
and
quiet
all
day
only
to
burst
forth
in
a
blaze
of
revel
in
the
evening
which
revel
lasts
all
night
this
goes
on
until
some
momentous
night
at
the
request
of
certain
proper
ones
a
police
officer
glides
quietly
into
the
midst
of
a
scene
of
unusual
gaiety
and
the
festive
company
melts
into
oblivion
never
to
return
they
also
are
then
discussed
with
rapturous
relish
and
in
tones
properly
lowered
over
the
farther
down
the
street
there
will
live
an
interesting
being
of
feminine
persuasion
who
has
had
five
divorces
and
is
in
course
of
obtaining
another
these
divorces
the
causes
therefor
the
justice
thereof
and
the
future
prospects
of
the
widow
are
gone
over
in
all
their
bearings
by
the
indefatigable
tongues
every
incident
in
the
history
of
the
street
is
put
through
a
course
of
sprouts
by
these
same
tireless
members
the
jewish
family
that
lives
in
the
poorest
house
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
is
said
to
count
its
money
by
the
hundred
thousands
the
aristocratic
family
with
the
curtains
in
the
windows
that
lives
on
the
county
the
family
whose
husband
and
father
gains
for
it
a
comfortable
livelihood
forging
checks
the
miner
s
family
whose
wife
and
mother
wastes
its
substance
in
diamonds
and
sealskin
coats
and
other
riotous
living
the
family
in
extremely
straitened
circumstances
into
which
new
babies
arrive
in
great
and
distressing
numbers
the
strange
lady
with
an
apoplectic
complexion
and
a
wonderfully
foul
and
violent
flow
of
invective
all
are
discussed
over
and
over
and
over
again
no
one
is
omitted
and
so
this
is
butte
the
promiscuous
the
bohemian
and
all
these
are
the
devil
s
playthings
they
amuse
him
doubtless
butte
is
a
place
of
sand
and
barrenness
the
souls
of
these
people
are
dumb
february
always
i
wonder
when
i
die
will
there
be
any
one
to
remember
me
with
love
i
know
i
am
not
lovable
that
i
want
it
so
much
only
makes
me
less
lovable
it
seems
but
who
knows
it
may
be
there
will
be
some
one
my
anemone
lady
does
not
love
me
how
can
she
since
she
does
not
understand
me
but
she
allows
me
to
love
her
and
that
carries
me
a
long
way
there
are
many
oh
a
great
many
who
will
not
allow
you
to
love
them
if
you
would
there
is
no
one
to
love
me
now
always
i
wonder
how
it
will
be
after
some
long
years
when
i
find
myself
about
to
die
february
in
this
house
where
i
drag
out
my
accursed
devilish
weary
existence
upstairs
in
the
bathroom
on
the
little
ledge
at
the
top
of
the
wainscoting
there
are
six
an
ordinary
white
one
that
is
my
younger
brother
s
a
white
one
that
is
my
sister
s
a
one
that
is
my
older
brother
s
a
one
that
is
my
stepfather
s
a
one
that
is
mine
and
another
ordinary
one
that
is
my
mother
s
the
sight
of
these
day
after
day
week
after
week
and
always
is
one
of
the
most
crushingly
maddening
circumstances
in
my
fool
s
life
every
friday
i
wash
up
the
bathroom
usually
i
like
to
do
this
i
like
the
feeling
of
the
water
squeezing
through
my
fingers
and
always
it
leaves
my
nails
beautifully
neat
but
the
obviousness
of
those
six
signifying
me
and
the
five
other
members
of
this
family
and
the
aimless
emptiness
of
my
existence
here
friday
after
friday
makes
my
soul
weary
and
my
heart
sick
never
does
the
pitiable
barren
contemptible
damnable
narrow
nothingness
of
my
life
in
this
house
come
upon
me
with
so
intense
a
force
as
when
my
eyes
happen
upon
those
six
among
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
a
minute
refinement
of
cruelty
was
reached
when
the
victim
s
head
was
placed
beneath
a
falling
of
water
drop
by
drop
a
convict
sentenced
to
solitary
confinement
spending
his
endless
days
staring
at
four
blank
walls
feels
that
had
he
committed
every
known
crime
he
could
not
possibly
deserve
his
punishment
i
am
not
undergoing
an
inquisition
nor
am
i
a
convict
in
solitary
confinement
but
i
live
in
a
house
with
people
who
affect
me
mostly
through
their
and
those
i
should
like
above
all
things
to
gather
up
and
pitch
out
of
the
bathroom
window
and
oh
damn
them
them
you
who
read
this
can
you
understand
the
depth
of
bitterness
and
hatred
that
is
contained
in
this
for
me
perhaps
you
can
a
little
if
you
are
a
woman
and
have
felt
yourself
alone
when
i
look
at
the
six
a
fierce
lurid
storm
of
rage
and
passion
comes
over
me
two
heavy
leaden
hands
lay
hold
of
my
life
and
press
press
press
they
strike
the
sick
sick
weariness
to
my
inmost
soul
oh
to
leave
this
house
and
these
people
and
this
intense
nothingness
oh
to
pass
out
from
them
forever
but
where
can
i
go
what
can
i
do
i
feel
with
mad
fury
that
i
am
helpless
the
grasp
of
the
stepfather
and
the
mother
is
contemptible
and
absurd
but
with
the
persistence
and
tenacity
of
narrow
minds
it
is
like
the
two
heavy
leaden
hands
it
is
not
seen
it
is
not
tangible
it
is
felt
once
i
took
away
my
own
from
the
bathroom
ledge
and
kept
it
in
my
bedroom
for
a
day
or
two
i
thought
to
lessen
the
effect
of
the
six
i
put
it
back
in
the
bathroom
the
absence
of
one
accentuated
the
significant
damnation
of
the
others
there
was
something
more
forcibly
maddening
in
the
five
than
in
the
six
the
damnation
was
not
worse
but
it
developed
my
feeling
about
them
more
vividly
and
so
i
put
my
back
in
the
bathroom
this
house
is
comfortably
furnished
my
mother
spends
her
life
in
the
adornment
of
it
the
small
square
rooms
are
distinctly
pretty
but
when
i
look
at
them
seeingly
i
think
of
the
proverb
about
the
dinner
of
stalled
ox
yet
there
is
no
hatred
here
except
mine
and
my
bitterness
i
am
the
only
one
of
them
whose
bitter
spirit
cries
out
against
things
but
there
is
that
which
is
subtler
and
strikes
deeper
there
is
the
lack
of
sympathy
the
lack
of
everything
that
counts
there
is
the
great
deep
nothing
how
much
better
were
there
hatred
here
than
nothing
i
long
hopelessly
for
resolution
to
take
my
life
into
my
own
hands
to
walk
away
from
this
house
some
day
and
never
return
i
have
nowhere
to
go
no
money
and
i
know
the
world
quite
too
well
to
put
the
slightest
faith
in
its
voluntary
kindness
of
heart
but
how
much
better
and
wider
less
damned
less
maddening
to
go
out
into
it
and
be
beaten
and
cheated
and
fooled
with
than
this
thing
that
gathers
itself
easily
into
a
circle
made
of
six
with
a
sufficiency
of
surplus
damnation
i
have
read
about
a
woman
who
went
down
from
jerusalem
to
jericho
and
fell
among
thieves
perhaps
she
had
a
house
at
jerusalem
with
six
and
nothingness
in
that
case
she
might
have
rushed
gladly
into
the
arms
of
thieves
i
think
of
crimes
that
strike
horror
and
revulsion
to
my
and
i
think
of
my
nothingness
and
i
ask
myself
were
it
not
better
to
walk
the
earth
an
outcast
a
solitary
woman
and
meet
and
face
even
these
than
that
each
and
every
one
of
my
should
wear
slowly
painfully
to
shreds
and
strain
and
break
in
this
unnameable
nothing
oh
the
dreariness
the
hopelessness
of
nothing
there
are
no
words
to
tell
it
and
things
are
always
hardest
to
bear
when
there
are
no
words
for
them
however
great
one
s
gift
of
language
may
be
there
is
always
something
that
one
can
not
tell
i
am
weary
of
self
always
self
but
it
must
be
so
my
life
is
filled
with
if
my
soul
could
awaken
fully
perhaps
i
might
be
lifted
out
of
myself
surely
i
should
be
but
my
soul
is
not
awake
it
is
awakening
trying
to
open
its
eyes
and
it
is
crying
out
blindly
after
something
but
it
can
not
i
have
a
dreadful
feeling
that
it
will
stay
always
like
this
oh
i
feel
everything
everything
i
feel
what
might
be
and
there
is
nothing
there
are
six
would
i
stop
for
a
few
fine
distinctions
a
theory
a
natural
law
even
to
escape
from
this
into
happiness
or
into
something
greatly
less
misery
misery
if
only
i
could
feel
it
less
oh
the
weariness
the
weariness
as
i
await
the
devil
s
coming
february
often
i
walk
out
to
a
place
on
the
flat
valley
below
the
town
to
flirt
with
death
there
is
within
me
a
latent
spirit
of
coquetry
it
appears
down
on
the
flat
there
is
a
certain
deep
dark
hole
with
several
feet
of
water
at
the
bottom
this
hole
completely
fascinates
me
sometimes
when
i
start
out
to
walk
in
a
quite
different
direction
i
feel
impelled
almost
irresistibly
to
turn
and
go
down
on
the
flat
in
the
direction
of
the
fascinating
deep
black
hole
and
here
i
flirt
with
death
the
hole
is
so
narrow
only
about
four
feet
across
and
so
dark
and
so
deep
i
don
t
know
whether
it
was
intended
to
be
a
well
or
whether
it
is
an
abandoned
shaft
of
some
miner
at
any
rate
it
is
isolated
and
deserted
and
it
has
a
rare
loving
charm
for
me
i
go
there
sometimes
in
the
early
evening
and
kneel
on
the
edge
of
it
and
lean
over
the
dark
pit
with
my
hand
grasping
a
wooden
stake
that
is
driven
into
the
ground
near
by
and
i
drop
little
stones
down
and
hear
them
splash
hollowly
and
it
sounds
a
long
way
off
there
is
something
wonderfully
soothing
wonderfully
comforting
to
my
unrestful
aching
wooden
heart
in
the
dark
mystery
of
this
fascinating
hole
here
is
the
end
for
me
if
i
want
it
here
is
the
ceasing
when
i
want
it
and
i
lean
over
and
smile
quietly
no
flowers
i
say
softly
to
myself
no
weeping
idiots
no
senseless
funeral
no
oily
undertaker
fussing
over
my
woman
no
useless
christian
prayers
nothing
but
this
deep
dark
restful
no
one
would
ever
find
it
it
is
a
mile
and
a
half
from
any
house
the
water
the
dark
still
water
at
the
bottom
would
gurgle
over
me
and
make
an
end
quickly
or
if
i
feared
there
was
not
enough
water
i
would
bring
with
me
a
syringe
and
some
morphine
and
inject
an
immense
quantity
into
one
white
arm
and
kneel
over
the
tender
darkness
until
my
senses
should
be
overcome
and
my
slim
light
body
should
fall
it
would
splash
into
the
water
at
the
bottom
it
would
follow
the
little
stones
at
last
and
the
black
muddy
water
would
soak
in
and
begin
the
destroying
of
my
body
and
murky
bubbles
would
rise
so
long
as
my
lungs
continued
to
breathe
or
perhaps
my
body
would
fall
against
the
side
of
the
hole
and
the
head
would
lie
against
it
out
of
the
water
or
perhaps
only
the
face
would
be
out
of
the
water
turned
upward
to
the
light
above
or
turned
and
the
hair
would
be
darkly
wet
and
heavy
and
the
face
would
be
below
it
and
the
eyes
would
sink
inward
the
end
the
end
i
say
softly
and
ecstatically
yet
i
do
not
lean
farther
out
my
hand
does
not
loosen
its
tight
grasp
on
the
wooden
stake
i
am
only
flirting
with
death
now
death
is
fascinating
almost
like
the
devil
death
makes
use
of
all
his
arts
and
wiles
powerful
and
alluring
and
flirts
with
deadly
temptation
for
me
and
i
make
use
of
my
arts
and
wiles
and
tempt
him
death
would
like
dearly
to
have
me
and
i
would
like
dearly
to
have
him
it
is
a
flirtation
that
has
its
source
in
mutual
desire
we
do
not
love
each
other
death
and
i
we
are
not
friends
but
we
desire
each
other
sensually
lustfully
sometime
i
suppose
i
shall
yield
to
the
desire
i
merely
play
at
it
now
but
in
an
unmistakable
manner
death
knows
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
but
first
the
devil
must
come
first
the
devil
then
death
a
deep
dark
soothing
grave
and
the
early
evening
and
a
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
february
i
am
in
no
small
degree
i
find
a
sham
a
player
to
the
gallery
possibly
this
may
be
felt
as
you
read
these
analyses
while
all
of
these
emotions
are
written
in
the
utmost
seriousness
and
sincerity
and
are
exactly
as
i
feel
them
day
after
day
so
far
as
i
have
the
power
to
express
what
i
feel
still
i
aim
to
convey
through
them
all
the
idea
that
i
am
lacking
in
the
grand
element
of
truth
that
there
is
in
the
warp
and
woof
of
my
life
a
thread
that
is
false
false
i
don
t
know
how
to
say
this
without
the
fear
of
being
misunderstood
when
i
say
i
am
in
a
way
a
sham
i
have
no
reference
to
the
truths
as
i
have
given
them
in
this
portrayal
but
to
a
very
light
and
subtle
thing
that
runs
through
them
oh
do
not
think
for
an
instant
that
this
analysis
of
my
emotions
is
not
perfectly
sincere
and
real
and
that
i
have
not
felt
all
of
them
more
than
i
can
put
into
words
they
are
my
tears
my
but
in
my
life
in
my
personality
there
is
an
essence
of
falseness
and
insincerity
a
thin
fine
vapor
of
fraud
hangs
always
over
me
and
dampens
and
injures
some
things
in
me
that
i
value
i
have
not
succeeded
thoroughly
in
analyzing
this
it
is
so
thin
so
elusive
so
faint
and
yet
not
little
it
is
a
natural
thing
enough
viewed
in
the
light
of
my
other
traits
i
have
lived
my
nineteen
years
buried
in
an
environment
at
utter
variance
with
my
natural
instincts
where
my
inner
life
is
never
touched
and
my
sympathies
very
rarely
if
ever
appealed
to
i
never
disclose
my
real
desires
or
the
texture
of
my
soul
never
that
is
to
say
to
any
one
except
my
one
friend
the
anemone
and
so
every
day
of
my
life
i
am
playing
a
part
i
am
keeping
an
immense
bundle
of
things
hidden
under
my
cloak
when
one
has
played
a
part
a
false
part
all
one
s
life
for
i
was
a
sly
artful
little
liar
even
in
the
days
of
five
and
six
then
one
is
marked
one
may
never
rid
oneself
of
the
mantle
of
falseness
charlatanry
particularly
if
one
is
innately
a
liar
a
year
ago
when
the
friendship
of
my
anemone
lady
was
given
me
and
she
would
sometimes
hear
sympathetically
some
bit
of
pain
i
felt
a
snapping
of
cords
a
breaking
away
of
and
a
strange
new
pain
i
felt
as
if
i
must
clasp
her
gentle
hand
tightly
and
give
way
to
the
surging
tears
of
eighteen
years
i
had
wanted
this
tender
thing
more
than
anything
else
all
my
life
and
it
was
given
me
suddenly
i
felt
a
convulsion
and
a
melting
within
but
i
could
not
tell
my
one
friend
exactly
what
i
felt
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
as
to
my
own
perfect
sincerity
of
feeling
but
there
was
with
it
and
around
it
this
vapor
of
fraud
a
spirit
of
falseness
that
rose
and
confronted
me
and
said
hypocrite
it
may
be
that
the
spirit
of
falseness
is
itself
a
false
thing
yet
true
or
false
it
is
with
me
always
i
have
tried
in
writing
out
my
emotions
to
convey
an
idea
of
this
sham
element
while
still
telling
everything
faithfully
true
sometimes
i
think
i
have
succeeded
and
at
other
times
i
seem
to
have
signally
failed
this
element
of
falseness
is
absolutely
the
very
thinnest
the
very
finest
the
rarest
of
all
the
things
in
my
character
it
is
not
the
most
unimportant
i
have
seen
visions
of
myself
walking
in
various
pathways
i
have
seen
myself
trying
one
pathway
and
another
and
always
it
is
the
same
i
see
before
me
in
the
path
darkening
the
way
and
filling
me
with
dread
and
discouragement
a
great
black
shadow
the
shadow
of
my
own
element
of
falseness
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
it
i
am
an
innate
liar
this
is
a
hard
thing
to
write
about
of
all
things
it
is
the
most
liable
to
be
misunderstood
you
will
probably
misunderstand
it
for
i
have
not
succeeded
in
giving
the
right
idea
of
it
i
aimed
at
it
and
missed
it
it
eluded
me
completely
you
must
take
the
idea
as
i
have
just
now
presented
it
for
what
it
may
be
worth
this
is
as
near
as
i
can
come
to
it
but
it
is
something
infinitely
finer
and
rarer
it
is
a
difficult
task
to
show
to
others
a
thing
which
though
i
feel
and
recognize
it
thoroughly
i
have
not
yet
analyzed
for
myself
but
this
is
a
complete
portrayal
of
me
as
i
await
the
devil
s
coming
and
i
must
tell
everything
everything
february
so
then
yes
as
i
have
said
i
find
that
i
am
quite
quite
odd
my
various
acquaintances
say
that
i
am
they
say
oh
it
s
that
may
maclane
dolly
s
younger
sister
she
s
but
i
call
it
oddity
i
bear
the
of
oddity
there
was
a
time
a
year
or
two
since
when
i
was
an
exceedingly
sensitive
little
fool
sensitive
in
that
it
used
to
strike
very
deep
when
my
young
acquaintances
would
call
me
funny
and
find
in
me
a
vent
for
their
distinctly
unfriendly
ridicule
my
years
in
the
high
school
were
not
years
of
joy
two
years
ago
i
had
not
yet
risen
above
these
things
i
was
a
sensitive
little
fool
but
that
sensitiveness
i
rejoice
to
say
has
gone
from
me
the
opinion
of
these
young
people
or
of
these
old
people
is
now
a
thing
that
is
quite
unable
to
affect
me
the
more
i
see
of
conventionality
it
seems
the
more
i
am
odd
though
i
am
young
and
feminine
very
feminine
yet
i
am
not
that
quaint
conceit
a
the
sort
of
person
that
laura
richards
writes
about
and
nora
perry
and
louisa
alcott
girls
with
bright
eyes
and
with
charming
faces
they
always
have
charming
faces
standing
with
reluctant
feet
where
the
brook
and
river
meet
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
missed
all
that
i
have
read
some
a
few
years
ago
hildegarde
grahame
and
what
katy
did
and
all
but
i
read
them
from
afar
i
looked
at
those
creatures
from
behind
a
high
board
fence
i
felt
as
if
i
had
more
tastes
in
common
with
the
jews
wandering
through
the
wilderness
or
with
a
band
of
fighting
amazons
i
am
not
a
girl
i
am
a
woman
of
a
kind
i
began
to
be
a
woman
at
twelve
or
more
properly
a
genius
and
then
usually
if
one
is
not
a
girl
one
is
a
heroine
of
the
kind
you
read
about
but
i
am
not
a
heroine
either
a
heroine
is
beautiful
eyes
like
the
sea
shoot
opaque
glances
from
under
drooping
lids
walks
with
undulating
movements
her
bright
smile
haunts
one
still
falls
methodically
in
love
with
a
man
always
with
a
man
eats
things
they
are
always
called
viands
with
a
delicate
appetite
and
on
special
occasions
her
voice
is
full
of
tears
i
do
none
of
these
things
i
am
not
beautiful
i
do
not
walk
with
undulating
movements
indeed
i
have
never
seen
any
one
walk
so
except
perhaps
a
cow
that
has
been
overfed
my
bright
smile
haunts
no
one
i
shoot
no
opaque
glances
from
my
eyes
which
are
not
like
the
sea
by
any
means
i
have
never
eaten
any
viands
and
my
appetite
for
what
i
do
eat
is
most
excellent
and
my
voice
has
never
yet
to
my
knowledge
been
full
of
tears
no
i
am
not
a
heroine
there
never
seem
to
be
any
plain
heroines
except
jane
eyre
and
she
was
very
unsatisfactory
she
should
have
entered
into
marriage
with
her
beloved
rochester
in
the
first
place
i
should
have
let
there
be
a
dozen
mad
wives
upstairs
but
i
suppose
the
author
thought
she
must
give
her
heroine
some
desirable
thing
high
moral
principles
since
she
was
not
beautiful
some
people
say
that
beauty
is
a
curse
it
may
be
true
but
i
m
sure
i
should
not
have
at
all
minded
being
cursed
a
little
and
i
know
several
persons
who
might
well
say
the
same
but
anyway
i
wish
some
one
would
write
a
book
about
a
plain
bad
heroine
so
that
i
might
feel
in
real
sympathy
with
her
so
far
from
being
a
girl
or
a
heroine
i
am
a
thief
as
i
have
before
suggested
i
mind
me
of
how
not
long
since
i
stole
three
dollars
a
woman
whom
i
know
rather
well
and
lives
near
called
me
into
her
house
as
i
was
passing
and
asked
me
to
do
an
errand
for
her
she
was
having
an
ornate
gown
made
and
she
needed
some
more
appliqué
with
which
to
festoon
it
the
appliqué
cost
nine
dollars
a
yard
my
trusting
neighbor
gave
me
a
bit
of
the
braid
for
a
sample
and
two
bills
i
was
to
get
four
yards
i
did
so
and
came
back
and
gave
her
the
braid
and
a
single
dollar
the
other
three
dollars
i
kept
myself
i
wanted
three
dollars
very
much
to
put
with
a
few
that
i
already
had
in
my
purse
my
trusting
neighbor
is
of
the
kind
that
throws
money
about
carelessly
i
knew
she
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
a
little
detail
like
that
she
was
deeply
interested
in
her
new
frock
or
perhaps
she
would
think
i
had
got
dollars
worth
of
appliqué
at
any
rate
she
did
not
need
the
money
and
i
wanted
three
dollars
and
so
i
stole
it
i
am
a
thief
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
i
am
a
kleptomaniac
but
i
am
sure
my
mind
is
perfectly
sane
i
have
no
such
excuse
i
am
a
plain
downright
thief
this
is
only
one
of
my
many
peculations
i
steal
money
or
anything
that
i
want
whenever
i
can
nearly
always
it
amuses
me
and
one
must
be
amused
i
have
only
two
stipulations
that
the
person
to
whom
it
belongs
does
not
need
it
pressingly
and
that
there
is
not
the
smallest
chance
of
being
found
out
and
of
course
i
could
not
think
of
stealing
from
my
one
friend
it
would
be
extremely
inconvenient
to
be
known
as
a
thief
merely
when
the
world
knows
you
are
a
thief
it
blinds
itself
completely
to
your
other
attributes
it
calls
you
a
thief
and
there
s
an
end
i
am
a
genius
as
well
as
a
thief
but
the
world
would
quite
overlook
that
fact
a
thief
s
a
thief
says
the
world
that
is
very
true
but
the
mere
fact
of
being
a
thief
should
not
exclude
the
consideration
of
one
s
other
traits
when
the
world
knows
you
are
a
methodist
minister
for
instance
it
will
admit
that
you
may
also
be
a
violinist
or
a
chemist
or
a
poet
and
will
credit
you
therefor
and
so
if
it
condemns
you
for
being
a
thief
it
should
at
the
same
time
admire
you
for
being
a
genius
if
it
does
not
admire
you
for
being
a
genius
then
it
has
no
right
to
condemn
you
for
being
a
thief
and
why
the
world
should
condemn
any
one
for
being
a
thief
when
there
is
not
within
its
confines
any
one
who
is
not
a
thief
in
some
way
is
a
bit
of
irony
upon
which
i
have
wasted
much
futile
i
am
not
trying
to
justify
myself
for
stealing
i
do
not
consider
it
a
thing
that
needs
to
be
justified
any
more
than
walking
or
eating
or
going
to
bed
but
as
i
say
if
the
world
knew
that
i
am
a
thief
without
being
first
made
aware
with
emphasis
that
i
am
some
other
things
also
then
the
world
would
be
a
shade
cooler
for
me
than
it
already
is
which
would
be
very
cool
indeed
and
so
in
writing
my
portrayal
i
have
dwelt
upon
other
things
at
some
length
before
touching
on
my
thieving
propensities
none
of
my
acquaintances
would
suspect
that
i
am
a
thief
i
look
so
respectable
so
refined
so
nice
so
inoffensive
so
sweet
even
but
for
that
matter
i
am
a
great
many
things
that
i
do
not
appear
to
be
the
woman
from
whom
i
stole
the
three
dollars
if
she
reads
this
will
recognize
it
this
will
be
inconvenient
i
fervently
hope
she
may
not
read
it
it
is
true
she
is
not
of
the
kind
that
reads
but
after
all
it
s
of
no
consequence
this
portrayal
is
mary
maclane
her
wooden
heart
her
young
woman
her
mind
her
soul
the
world
may
run
and
read
i
will
tell
you
what
i
did
with
the
three
dollars
in
dublin
gulch
which
is
a
rough
quarter
of
butte
inhabited
by
poor
irish
people
there
lives
an
old
woman
she
lives
alone
in
a
small
untidy
house
she
swears
frightfully
like
a
parrot
and
her
reputation
is
bad
so
bad
indeed
that
even
the
old
woman
s
compatriots
in
dublin
gulch
do
not
visit
her
lest
they
damage
their
own
it
is
true
that
the
profane
old
woman
s
morals
are
not
good
have
never
been
good
judged
by
the
world
s
standards
she
bears
various
marks
of
cold
rough
handling
on
her
mind
and
body
her
life
has
all
but
run
its
course
she
is
worn
out
once
in
a
while
i
go
to
visit
this
old
woman
my
reputation
must
be
sadly
damaged
by
now
i
sit
with
her
for
an
hour
or
two
and
listen
to
her
she
is
extremely
glad
to
have
me
there
except
me
she
has
no
one
to
talk
to
but
the
milkman
the
groceryman
and
the
butcher
so
always
she
is
glad
to
see
me
there
is
a
certain
bond
of
sympathy
between
her
and
me
we
are
fond
of
each
other
when
she
sees
me
picking
my
way
towards
her
house
her
hard
sour
face
softens
wonderfully
and
a
light
of
distinct
friendliness
comes
into
her
green
eyes
don
t
you
know
there
are
few
people
enough
in
the
world
whose
hard
sour
faces
will
soften
at
sight
of
you
and
a
distinctly
friendly
light
come
into
their
green
eyes
for
myself
i
find
such
people
few
indeed
so
the
profane
old
woman
and
i
are
fond
of
each
other
no
question
of
morals
or
of
immorals
comes
between
us
we
are
equals
i
talk
to
her
a
little
but
mostly
she
talks
she
tells
me
of
the
time
when
she
lived
in
county
galway
when
she
was
young
and
of
her
several
husbands
and
of
some
who
were
not
husbands
and
of
her
children
scattered
over
the
earth
and
she
shows
me
old
of
these
people
she
has
told
me
the
varied
tale
of
her
life
a
great
many
times
i
like
to
hear
her
tell
it
it
is
like
nothing
else
i
have
heard
the
story
in
its
unblushing
simplicity
the
old
woman
sitting
telling
it
and
the
contain
a
thing
that
is
absurdly
grotesquely
tearlessly
sad
once
when
i
went
to
her
house
i
brought
with
me
six
immense
heavy
fragrant
chrysanthemums
they
had
been
bought
with
the
three
dollars
i
had
stolen
it
pleased
me
to
buy
them
for
the
profane
old
woman
they
pleased
her
also
not
because
she
cares
much
for
flowers
but
because
i
brought
them
to
her
i
knew
they
would
please
her
but
that
was
not
the
reason
i
gave
her
them
i
did
it
purely
and
simply
to
please
myself
i
knew
the
profane
old
woman
would
not
be
at
all
concerned
as
to
whether
they
had
been
bought
with
stolen
money
or
not
and
my
only
regret
was
that
i
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
steal
a
larger
sum
so
that
i
might
have
bought
more
chrysanthemums
without
inconveniencing
my
purse
but
as
it
was
they
filled
her
dirty
little
dwelling
with
perfume
and
color
long
ago
when
i
was
six
i
was
a
thief
only
i
was
not
then
as
now
a
graceful
thief
i
had
not
the
philosophy
of
stealing
when
i
would
steal
a
copper
cent
out
of
my
mother
s
pocketbook
i
would
feel
a
dreadful
suffocating
sinking
in
my
bad
heart
and
for
days
and
nights
afterwards
long
after
i
had
eaten
the
chocolate
mouse
the
copper
cent
would
haunt
me
and
haunt
me
and
oh
how
i
wished
it
back
in
that
pocketbook
with
the
clasp
shut
tight
and
the
bureau
drawer
locked
and
so
is
it
not
finer
to
be
nineteen
and
a
thief
with
the
philosophy
of
stealing
than
to
be
six
and
haunted
day
and
night
by
a
copper
cent
for
now
always
my
only
regret
is
when
i
have
stolen
five
dollars
that
i
did
not
steal
ten
while
i
was
about
it
it
is
a
long
time
ago
since
i
was
six
february
i
walked
over
the
hill
where
the
sun
vanishes
down
in
the
afternoon
i
followed
the
sun
so
far
as
i
could
but
two
even
very
good
legs
can
do
no
more
than
carry
one
into
the
midst
of
the
sunshine
and
then
one
may
stand
and
take
leave
lovingly
of
it
i
stood
in
the
valley
below
the
hill
and
looked
away
at
the
mountains
that
rise
into
the
cloudy
blue
and
at
the
long
gray
stretches
of
rolling
sand
it
all
reminded
me
of
the
devil
and
the
happiness
he
will
bring
me
some
day
the
devil
will
come
to
me
and
say
come
with
and
i
will
answer
and
he
will
take
me
away
with
him
to
a
place
where
it
is
wet
and
green
where
the
yellow
yellow
sunshine
falls
on
hills
and
misty
cloudy
masses
float
over
the
valleys
and
for
days
i
shall
be
happy
happy
happy
for
the
devil
and
i
will
love
each
other
intensely
perfectly
for
days
he
will
be
incarnate
but
he
will
not
be
a
man
he
will
be
the
and
his
soul
will
take
mine
to
itself
and
they
will
be
one
for
days
imagine
me
raised
out
of
my
misery
and
obscurity
dullness
and
nothingness
into
the
full
brilliant
life
of
the
devil
for
days
the
love
of
the
will
enter
into
my
barren
barren
life
and
melt
all
the
cold
hard
things
and
water
the
barrenness
and
a
million
little
green
growing
plants
will
start
out
of
it
and
a
clear
sparkling
spring
will
flow
over
it
through
the
dreary
sandy
stretches
of
my
bitterness
among
the
false
stony
roadways
of
my
pain
and
hatred
and
a
great
rushing
flashing
cataract
of
melting
love
will
flow
over
my
weariness
and
unrest
and
wash
it
away
forever
my
soul
will
be
fully
awakened
and
there
will
be
a
million
little
sweet
new
souls
in
the
green
growing
things
and
they
will
fill
my
life
with
everything
that
is
beautiful
tenderness
and
divineness
and
compassion
and
exaltation
and
uplifting
grace
and
light
and
rest
and
gentleness
and
triumph
and
truth
and
peace
my
life
will
be
borne
far
out
of
self
and
self
will
sink
quietly
out
of
sight
and
i
shall
see
it
farther
and
farther
away
until
it
disappears
it
is
the
last
the
of
that
mary
maclane
i
will
say
and
i
will
feel
a
long
sighing
quivering
farewell
a
thousand
years
of
misery
and
now
a
million
years
of
happiness
when
the
sun
is
setting
in
the
valley
and
the
crests
of
those
hills
are
painted
violet
and
purple
and
the
valley
itself
is
reeking
and
swimming
in
light
the
whom
i
love
more
than
all
and
i
will
go
out
into
it
we
will
be
saturated
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
sun
and
the
gold
light
of
love
the
will
say
to
me
look
you
little
creature
at
this
beautiful
picture
of
joy
and
happiness
it
is
the
picture
of
your
life
as
it
will
be
while
i
am
with
you
and
i
am
with
you
for
ah
yes
i
will
take
a
last
long
farewell
of
this
mary
maclane
not
one
faint
shadow
of
her
weary
wretched
nothingness
will
remain
there
will
be
instead
a
brilliant
buoyant
joyous
creature
transformed
adorned
garlanded
by
the
love
of
the
devil
my
mind
will
be
a
of
art
swept
and
garnished
and
strong
and
at
its
best
my
barren
hungry
heart
will
come
at
last
to
its
own
the
red
flames
of
the
s
love
will
burn
out
forever
its
pitiable
distorted
wooden
quality
and
he
will
take
it
and
cherish
it
and
give
me
his
my
young
woman
likewise
will
be
metamorphosed
and
i
shall
feel
it
developing
and
filled
with
myriads
of
little
contentments
and
pleasures
always
my
young
woman
is
a
great
and
important
part
of
me
and
when
i
am
married
to
the
devil
its
and
intricate
sensibility
will
be
culminated
to
marvelous
completeness
my
soul
upon
my
soul
will
descend
consciously
the
light
that
never
was
on
land
or
sea
this
will
be
for
days
for
days
no
matter
what
came
before
i
will
say
no
matter
what
comes
afterward
just
now
it
is
the
my
and
i
living
in
the
yellow
light
think
of
living
with
the
devil
in
a
bare
little
house
in
the
midst
of
green
wetness
and
sweetness
and
yellow
light
for
days
in
the
gray
dawn
it
will
be
ineffably
sweet
and
beautiful
with
shining
leaves
and
the
gray
unfathomable
air
and
the
wet
grass
and
all
be
happy
now
my
weary
little
wife
the
devil
will
say
and
the
long
long
day
will
be
filled
with
the
music
of
real
life
my
grandest
possibility
will
be
realized
the
world
contains
a
great
many
things
and
this
is
my
grandest
possibility
realized
i
will
weep
rapturous
tears
when
i
think
of
all
this
and
write
it
there
is
in
me
a
feeling
that
is
more
than
pain
perhaps
the
very
sweetest
the
tenderest
the
most
pitiful
and
benign
human
voice
in
the
world
could
sing
these
things
and
this
feeling
set
to
their
own
wondrous
music
and
it
would
echo
far
far
and
you
would
understand
february
at
times
when
i
walk
among
the
natural
things
the
barren
natural
things
i
know
that
i
believe
in
something
why
can
i
not
call
it
god
and
pray
to
it
there
is
something
i
do
not
know
it
intellectually
but
i
feel
it
i
it
with
my
soul
it
does
not
seem
to
reach
down
to
me
it
does
not
pity
me
it
does
not
look
at
me
tenderly
in
my
unhappiness
my
soul
feels
only
that
it
is
there
no
it
is
not
it
hurts
me
it
hurts
me
always
as
i
walk
over
the
sand
but
even
while
it
hurts
me
it
seems
to
promise
ah
those
beautiful
things
that
it
promises
me
and
then
the
hurting
is
anguish
for
i
know
that
the
promises
will
never
be
fulfilled
there
is
within
me
a
thing
that
is
aching
aching
aching
always
as
the
days
pass
it
is
not
my
pain
of
wanting
nor
my
pain
of
unrest
nor
my
pain
of
bitterness
nor
of
hatred
i
know
those
in
all
their
own
anguish
this
aching
is
another
pain
it
is
a
pain
that
i
do
not
know
that
i
feel
ignorantly
but
sharply
and
oh
it
is
torture
torture
my
soul
is
worn
and
weary
with
pain
there
is
no
compassion
no
mercy
upon
me
there
is
no
one
to
help
me
bear
it
it
is
just
i
alone
out
on
the
sand
and
barrenness
it
is
cruel
anguish
to
be
always
alone
and
so
long
oh
so
long
nineteen
years
are
as
ages
to
you
when
you
are
nineteen
when
you
are
nineteen
there
is
no
experience
to
tell
you
that
all
things
have
an
end
this
aching
pain
has
no
end
i
feel
no
tears
now
but
i
feel
heavy
sobs
that
shake
my
life
to
its
center
my
soul
is
wandering
in
a
wilderness
there
is
a
great
light
sometimes
that
draws
my
soul
toward
it
when
my
soul
turns
toward
it
it
shines
out
brilliant
and
dazzling
and
awful
and
the
worn
sensitive
thing
shrinks
away
and
shivers
and
is
faint
shall
my
soul
have
to
know
this
light
inevitably
must
it
some
day
plunge
into
this
oh
it
may
be
it
may
be
but
i
know
that
i
shall
die
with
the
pain
there
are
times
when
the
great
light
is
dim
and
beautiful
as
the
starlight
the
utter
agony
of
it
the
cruel
ineffable
loveliness
do
you
understand
this
i
am
telling
you
my
young
passionate
do
you
listen
to
it
indifferently
has
it
no
meaning
for
any
one
for
me
it
means
everything
for
me
it
makes
life
old
long
weariness
it
may
be
that
you
know
and
perhaps
you
would
even
weep
a
little
with
me
if
you
had
time
it
is
as
if
this
light
were
the
light
of
the
christian
religion
and
the
christian
religion
is
full
of
hatred
it
says
come
unto
me
you
that
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
but
when
you
would
go
when
you
reach
up
with
your
weary
hands
it
sends
you
a
light
it
makes
you
fair
wondrous
promises
it
puts
you
off
you
beseech
it
in
your
suffering
while
the
waters
near
me
roll
while
the
tempest
still
is
high
but
it
does
not
listen
it
does
not
care
worship
me
worship
me
it
says
but
after
that
let
me
alone
there
is
a
bookful
of
promises
take
it
and
thank
me
and
worship
me
it
does
not
care
if
i
obey
it
it
looks
on
indifferently
if
i
disobey
it
it
looks
on
indifferently
if
i
am
in
woe
it
looks
on
indifferently
if
i
am
in
a
brief
joy
it
looks
on
indifferently
i
am
left
all
alone
all
alone
the
light
is
shown
me
and
i
reach
after
it
but
it
is
placed
high
out
of
my
reach
i
see
the
promises
in
the
light
oh
why
does
it
promise
these
things
is
not
the
burden
of
life
already
greater
than
i
can
bear
and
there
is
the
story
of
the
christ
it
is
beautiful
it
is
damningly
beautiful
it
draws
the
tears
of
pain
and
soft
anguish
from
me
at
the
sense
of
beauty
and
when
every
nerve
in
me
is
melted
and
overflowing
then
suddenly
i
am
conscious
that
it
is
a
lie
a
everywhere
i
turn
there
is
nothing
nothing
my
soul
wails
out
its
grief
in
loneliness
my
soul
wanders
hither
and
thither
in
the
dark
wilderness
and
asks
asks
always
in
blind
dull
agony
how
long
how
long
february
life
is
a
pitiful
thing
february
i
stand
in
the
midst
of
my
sand
and
barrenness
and
gaze
hard
at
everything
that
is
within
my
range
of
vision
and
ruin
my
eyes
trying
to
see
into
the
darkness
beyond
and
nearly
always
i
feel
a
vague
contempt
for
you
fine
brave
world
for
you
and
all
the
things
that
i
see
from
my
barrenness
but
i
promise
you
if
some
one
comes
from
among
you
over
the
sunset
hill
one
day
with
love
for
me
i
will
fall
at
your
feet
i
am
a
selfish
conceited
impudent
little
animal
it
is
true
but
after
all
i
am
only
one
grand
conglomeration
of
wanting
and
when
some
one
comes
over
the
barren
hill
to
satisfy
the
wanting
i
will
be
humble
humble
in
my
triumph
it
is
a
difficult
thing
a
most
difficult
thing
to
live
on
as
one
year
follows
another
from
childhood
slowly
to
womanhood
without
one
single
sharer
of
your
life
to
be
alone
always
alone
when
your
one
friend
is
gone
oh
yes
it
is
hard
particularly
when
one
is
not
and
spiritual
when
one
s
near
longing
is
not
a
god
and
a
religion
when
one
wants
above
all
things
the
love
of
a
human
being
when
one
is
a
woman
young
and
all
alone
doubtless
you
know
this
after
all
fine
brave
world
there
are
some
things
that
you
know
very
well
whether
or
not
you
care
is
a
quite
different
matter
you
have
the
power
to
take
this
wooden
heart
in
a
tight
suffocating
grasp
you
have
the
power
to
do
this
with
pain
for
me
and
you
have
the
power
to
do
it
with
ravishing
gentleness
but
whether
or
not
you
will
is
another
matter
you
may
think
evil
of
me
before
you
have
finished
reading
this
you
will
be
very
right
to
think
so
according
to
your
standards
but
sometimes
you
see
evil
where
there
is
no
evil
and
think
evil
when
the
only
evil
is
in
your
own
brains
my
life
is
a
dry
and
barren
life
you
can
change
it
oh
the
little
more
and
how
much
it
is
and
the
little
less
and
what
worlds
yes
you
can
change
it
stranger
things
have
happened
again
whether
you
will
that
is
a
quite
different
thing
no
doubt
you
are
the
people
and
wisdom
will
die
with
you
i
do
not
question
that
i
will
admit
and
believe
anything
you
may
assert
about
yourselves
i
do
not
want
your
wisdom
your
judgment
i
want
some
one
to
come
up
over
the
barren
sunset
hill
my
thoughts
are
the
thoughts
of
youth
which
are
said
to
be
long
long
thoughts
your
life
is
and
filled
with
people
my
life
is
of
the
gray
of
sand
and
barrenness
and
consists
of
mary
maclane
the
longing
for
happiness
and
the
memory
of
the
anemone
lady
this
portrayal
is
my
deepest
sincerity
my
tears
my
drops
of
red
blood
some
of
it
is
wrung
from
me
wrung
by
my
ambition
to
tell
it
is
not
altogether
good
that
i
should
give
you
all
this
since
i
do
not
give
it
for
love
of
you
i
am
giving
it
in
exchange
for
a
few
things
i
want
you
to
know
all
these
passions
and
emotions
i
give
them
with
the
utmost
freedom
i
shall
be
furious
indeed
if
you
do
not
take
them
at
the
same
time
the
fact
that
i
am
exchanging
my
tears
and
my
drops
of
red
blood
for
your
trifles
is
not
a
thing
that
thrills
me
with
delight
but
it
s
of
little
moment
when
the
devil
comes
over
the
hill
with
happiness
i
will
rush
at
him
frantically
headlong
and
nothing
else
will
matter
february
mary
maclane
what
are
you
you
forlorn
desolate
little
creature
why
are
you
not
of
and
in
the
galloping
herd
why
is
it
that
you
stand
out
separate
against
the
background
of
a
gloomy
sky
why
can
you
not
enter
into
the
lives
and
sympathies
of
other
young
creatures
there
have
been
times
when
you
strained
every
despairing
nerve
to
do
so
before
you
realized
that
these
things
were
not
for
you
that
the
only
sympathy
for
you
was
that
of
mary
maclane
and
the
only
things
for
you
were
those
you
could
take
yourself
not
which
were
given
you
and
your
things
are
few
few
you
starved
lean
little
you
worn
obscure
little
genius
oh
it
is
a
wearisome
waiting
for
the
devil
february
when
i
walked
over
my
sand
and
barrenness
i
felt
infinite
grief
everything
is
beyond
me
nothing
is
mine
my
single
friendship
shines
brightly
before
me
and
is
fascinating
and
always
just
out
of
my
reach
i
want
the
love
and
sympathy
of
human
beings
and
i
repel
human
beings
yes
i
repel
human
beings
there
is
something
about
me
that
faintly
and
finely
and
unmistakably
repels
when
my
happiness
comes
shall
i
be
able
to
have
it
shall
i
ever
have
anything
this
repellent
power
is
not
an
outward
quality
it
is
something
that
comes
from
deeply
deeply
within
it
is
something
that
was
there
in
the
beginning
it
is
a
thing
from
the
original
there
is
no
ridding
myself
of
it
there
is
no
ridding
myself
of
it
there
is
no
ridding
myself
of
it
oh
i
am
damned
damned
there
is
not
one
soul
in
the
world
to
feel
for
me
and
with
me
not
one
out
of
all
the
millions
no
one
can
understand
you
are
saying
to
yourself
that
i
imagine
this
what
right
have
you
to
say
so
you
don
t
know
anything
about
me
i
know
all
about
me
i
have
studied
all
the
elements
and
phases
in
my
life
for
years
and
years
i
do
not
imagine
anything
i
am
even
fool
enough
to
shut
my
eyes
to
some
things
until
inevitably
i
know
i
must
meet
them
i
am
racked
with
the
passions
of
youth
and
i
am
young
in
years
beyond
that
i
am
mature
old
i
am
not
a
child
in
anything
but
my
passions
and
my
years
i
feel
and
recognize
everything
thoroughly
i
have
not
to
imagine
anything
my
inner
life
is
before
my
eyes
there
is
something
about
me
that
no
one
can
understand
can
there
ever
be
any
one
to
understand
shall
i
not
always
walk
my
barren
road
alone
this
follows
me
incessantly
it
is
burning
like
a
smouldering
fire
every
hour
of
my
life
oh
deep
black
despair
how
i
suffer
how
i
suffer
just
in
being
alive
i
feel
infinite
grief
oh
infinite
grief
march
often
in
the
early
morning
i
leave
my
bed
and
get
me
dressed
and
go
out
into
the
gray
dawn
there
is
something
about
the
gray
dawn
that
makes
me
wish
the
world
would
stop
that
the
sun
would
never
more
come
up
over
the
edge
that
my
life
would
go
on
and
on
and
rest
in
the
gray
dawn
in
the
gray
dawn
every
hard
thing
is
hidden
by
a
gray
mantle
of
charity
and
only
the
light
vague
caressing
fancies
are
left
sometimes
i
think
i
am
a
strange
strange
creature
something
not
of
earth
nor
yet
of
heaven
nor
of
hell
i
think
at
times
i
am
a
little
thing
fallen
on
the
earth
by
mistake
a
thing
thrown
among
foreign
unfitting
elements
where
there
is
nothing
in
touch
with
it
where
life
is
a
continual
struggle
where
every
little
door
is
closed
every
why
unanswered
and
itself
knows
not
where
to
lay
its
head
i
feel
a
deadly
certainty
in
some
moments
that
the
wild
world
contains
not
one
moment
of
rest
for
me
that
there
will
never
be
any
rest
that
my
woman
will
go
on
asking
long
long
centuries
after
my
woman
is
laid
in
its
grave
i
felt
this
in
the
gray
dawn
this
morning
but
the
gray
charitable
mantle
softened
it
always
i
feel
most
acutely
in
the
gray
dawn
but
always
there
is
the
thing
to
soften
it
the
gray
atmosphere
was
charged
there
was
a
tense
electrical
thrill
in
the
cold
soft
air
my
nerves
were
keenly
alive
but
the
gray
curtain
was
mercifully
there
i
did
not
feel
too
much
how
i
wished
the
yellow
beautiful
sun
would
never
more
come
up
over
the
edge
to
show
me
my
nearer
anguish
stay
with
me
stay
with
me
soft
gray
dawn
implored
every
one
of
my
tiny
lives
let
me
forget
let
the
vanity
the
pain
the
longing
sink
deep
and
vanish
all
of
it
all
of
it
and
let
me
rest
in
the
midst
of
the
gray
i
heard
music
the
silent
music
of
myriad
voices
that
you
hear
when
all
is
still
one
of
them
came
and
whispered
to
me
softly
don
t
suffer
any
more
just
now
little
mary
maclane
you
suffer
enough
in
the
brightness
of
the
sun
and
the
blackness
of
the
night
this
is
the
gray
dawn
take
a
little
yes
i
said
i
will
take
a
little
and
then
a
wild
swelling
chorus
of
voices
whispered
in
the
stillness
rest
rest
rest
little
mary
maclane
suffer
in
the
brightness
suffer
in
the
blackness
your
soul
your
wooden
heart
your
woman
but
now
a
little
rest
a
little
a
little
rest
i
said
again
and
straightway
i
began
resting
lest
the
sun
should
come
too
quickly
over
the
edge
when
i
have
heard
in
summer
the
wind
in
a
forest
of
pines
blowing
a
wondrous
symphony
of
purity
and
truth
my
varied
nature
felt
itself
abashed
and
there
was
a
sinking
in
my
wooden
heart
the
beauty
of
it
ravished
my
senses
but
it
savored
crushingly
of
the
virtue
that
is
far
above
and
beyond
me
and
i
felt
a
certain
sore
despairing
grief
but
the
gray
dawn
is
in
perfect
sympathy
it
is
quite
as
beautiful
as
the
wind
in
the
pines
and
its
truth
and
purity
are
extremely
gentle
and
partly
hidden
under
the
gray
curtain
almost
i
can
be
a
different
mary
maclane
out
in
the
gray
dawn
let
me
forget
all
the
mingled
agonies
of
my
life
let
me
walk
in
the
midst
of
this
soft
grayness
and
drink
of
the
waters
of
lethe
the
gray
dawn
is
not
paradise
it
is
not
a
happy
valley
it
is
not
a
garden
of
eden
it
is
not
a
vale
of
cashmere
it
is
the
gray
dawn
soft
charitable
tender
the
brilliant
celestial
yellow
will
come
soon
it
says
you
will
suffer
then
to
your
greatest
extent
but
now
i
am
here
and
so
and
so
in
the
gray
dawn
i
was
forgetting
for
a
brief
period
i
was
submerged
for
a
little
in
lethe
river
of
oblivion
if
i
had
seen
some
one
coming
over
the
near
horizon
with
happiness
i
should
have
protested
wait
wait
until
the
gray
dawn
has
passed
the
deep
deep
blue
of
the
summer
sky
stirs
me
to
a
joy
the
cool
green
of
a
river
fills
my
heart
with
unquiet
longings
the
red
red
of
the
sunset
sky
convulses
my
entire
being
with
passion
but
the
dear
gray
dawn
brings
me
rest
oh
the
gray
dawn
is
sweet
sweet
could
i
not
die
for
very
love
of
it
the
gray
dawn
can
do
no
wrong
if
those
myriad
voices
suddenly
had
begun
to
sing
a
voluptuous
evil
song
of
the
so
great
evil
that
i
could
not
understand
but
that
i
could
feel
instantly
still
the
gray
dawn
would
have
been
fine
and
sweet
and
beautiful
always
i
admire
mary
maclane
greatly
though
sometimes
in
my
admiration
i
feel
a
complete
contempt
for
her
but
in
the
gray
dawn
i
love
mary
maclane
tenderly
and
passionately
i
seem
to
take
on
a
strange
calm
indifference
to
everything
in
the
world
but
just
mary
maclane
and
the
gray
dawn
we
two
are
identified
with
each
other
and
joined
together
in
shadowy
vagueness
from
the
rest
of
the
world
as
i
walked
over
my
sand
and
barrenness
in
the
gray
dawn
a
poem
ran
continuously
through
my
mind
it
expressed
to
me
in
my
gray
condition
an
ideal
life
and
death
and
ending
every
desire
of
my
life
melted
away
in
the
gray
dawn
except
one
good
wish
that
my
own
life
and
death
might
be
short
and
obscure
and
complete
like
them
the
poem
was
this
beautiful
one
of
charles
kingsley
s
oh
mary
go
and
call
the
cattle
home
and
call
the
cattle
home
and
call
the
cattle
home
across
the
sands
of
dee
the
western
wind
was
wild
and
dank
with
foam
and
all
alone
went
she
the
creeping
tide
came
up
along
the
sand
and
o
er
and
o
er
the
sand
and
round
and
round
the
sand
as
far
as
eye
could
see
the
blinding
mist
came
up
and
hid
the
land
and
never
home
came
she
oh
is
it
weed
or
fish
or
floating
hair
a
tress
of
golden
hair
of
drowned
maiden
s
hair
above
the
nets
at
sea
was
never
salmon
yet
that
shone
so
fair
among
the
stakes
on
dee
they
rowed
her
in
across
the
rolling
foam
the
cruel
crawling
foam
the
cruel
hungry
foam
to
her
grave
beside
the
sea
but
still
the
boatmen
hear
her
call
the
cattle
home
across
the
sands
of
this
is
a
poem
perfect
and
in
the
gray
dawn
it
expresses
to
me
a
most
desirable
thing
a
short
eventless
life
a
sudden
ceasing
and
a
forgotten
voice
sometimes
calling
this
mary
in
the
gray
dawn
would
wish
nothing
else
if
the
waters
rolled
over
me
now
over
my
short
eventless
life
there
would
be
the
sudden
ceasing
and
the
anemone
lady
would
hear
my
voice
sometimes
and
remember
me
the
anemone
lady
and
one
or
two
others
and
after
a
short
time
even
my
pathetic
passionate
voice
would
sound
faint
and
be
forgotten
and
my
world
of
sand
and
barrenness
would
know
me
and
my
weary
little
no
more
and
well
for
me
i
say
in
the
gray
dawn
it
is
different
oh
very
different
when
the
yellow
bursts
through
the
gray
and
the
yellow
is
with
me
all
day
long
and
at
sunset
the
red
red
line
yet
oh
sweet
gray
dawn
march
sometimes
i
am
seized
with
nearer
vivider
sensations
of
love
for
my
one
friend
the
anemone
lady
she
is
so
dear
so
beautiful
my
love
for
her
is
a
peculiar
thing
it
is
not
the
ordinary
it
is
something
that
burns
with
a
vivid
fire
of
its
own
the
anemone
lady
is
enshrined
in
a
temple
on
the
inside
of
my
heart
that
shall
always
only
be
hers
she
is
my
first
love
my
only
dear
one
the
thought
of
her
fills
me
with
a
multitude
of
feelings
passionate
yet
wonderfully
tender
with
delight
with
rare
undefined
emotions
with
a
suggestion
of
tears
oh
dearest
anemone
lady
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
forget
your
beautiful
face
there
may
be
some
long
crowded
years
before
me
it
may
be
there
will
be
people
and
people
entering
and
departing
but
oh
no
no
i
shall
never
forget
there
will
be
in
my
life
always
always
the
faint
sweet
perfume
of
the
blue
anemone
the
memory
of
my
one
friend
before
she
went
away
to
see
her
to
be
near
her
was
an
event
in
my
life
a
coloring
of
the
dullness
always
when
i
used
to
look
at
her
there
would
rush
a
train
of
things
over
my
mind
a
vaguely
glittering
pageant
that
came
only
with
her
and
that
held
an
interest
for
me
there
were
manifold
and
varied
treasures
in
this
train
there
were
skies
of
spangled
sapphire
and
there
were
lilies
and
violets
wet
with
dew
there
was
the
music
of
violins
and
wonderful
weeds
from
the
deep
sea
and
songs
of
troubadours
and
gleaming
white
statues
there
were
ancient
forests
of
oak
and
clematis
vines
there
were
and
fretted
palaces
and
old
castles
with
moats
and
and
tiny
mullioned
windows
with
diamond
panes
there
was
a
cold
glittering
cataract
of
white
foam
and
a
little
green
boat
far
off
down
the
river
drifting
along
under
drooping
willows
there
was
a
tree
of
golden
apples
and
a
banquet
in
a
beautiful
house
with
the
melting
music
of
lutes
and
harps
and
mulled
in
tall
thin
glasses
there
was
a
field
of
long
fine
grass
soft
as
bat
and
there
were
birds
of
brilliant
plumage
scarlet
and
indigo
with
wings
all
these
and
a
thousand
fancies
alike
vaguely
glittering
would
rush
over
me
when
i
was
with
the
anemone
lady
always
my
brain
was
in
a
gentle
delirium
my
nerves
were
unquiet
it
was
because
i
love
her
oh
there
is
not
there
can
never
be
another
anemone
lady
my
life
is
a
desert
a
desert
but
the
thin
clinging
perfume
of
the
blue
anemone
reaches
to
its
utter
confines
and
nothing
in
the
desert
is
the
same
because
of
that
perfume
years
will
not
fade
the
blue
of
the
anemone
nor
a
thousand
bitter
winds
blow
away
the
rare
fragrance
i
feel
in
the
anemone
lady
a
strange
attraction
of
sex
there
is
in
me
a
masculine
element
that
when
i
am
thinking
of
her
arises
and
overshadows
all
the
others
why
am
i
not
a
man
i
say
to
the
sand
and
barrenness
with
a
certain
strained
tense
passion
that
i
might
give
this
wonderful
dear
delicious
woman
an
absolutely
perfect
love
and
this
is
my
predominating
feeling
for
her
so
then
it
is
not
the
but
the
set
in
the
mysterious
sensibilities
of
my
it
brings
me
pain
and
pleasure
mingled
in
that
odd
odd
fashion
do
you
think
a
man
is
the
only
creature
with
whom
one
may
fall
in
love
often
i
see
coming
across
the
desert
a
long
line
of
light
my
soul
turns
toward
it
and
shrinks
away
from
it
as
it
does
from
all
the
lights
some
day
perhaps
all
the
lights
will
roll
into
one
terrible
white
effervescence
and
rush
over
my
soul
and
kill
it
but
this
light
does
not
bring
so
much
of
pain
for
it
is
soft
and
silvery
and
always
with
it
is
the
soul
of
anemone
march
there
are
several
things
in
the
world
for
which
i
of
womankind
and
nineteen
years
have
conceived
a
forcible
repugnance
or
rather
the
feeling
was
born
in
me
i
did
not
have
to
conceive
it
often
my
mind
chants
a
fervent
litany
of
its
own
that
runs
somewhat
like
this

women
and
men
who
dispense
odors

rest
of

and
hurry
kind
devil
pray
for
i
am
weary
march
it
is
astonishing
to
me
how
very
many
contemptible
petty
vanities
are
lodged
in
the
crevices
of
my
genius
my
genius
itself
is
one
grand
good
vanity
but
it
is
not
contemptible
and
even
those
little
vanities
though
they
are
contemptible
i
do
not
hold
them
in
contempt
by
any
means
i
smile
involuntarily
at
their
absurdness
sometimes
but
i
know
well
that
they
have
their
function
they
are
peculiarly
of
my
mind
my
humanness
and
they
are
useful
therein
when
this
mind
stretches
out
its
hand
for
things
and
finds
only
wilderness
and
nothingness
all
about
it
and
draws
the
hand
back
empty
then
it
can
only
turn
back
like
my
soul
to
itself
and
it
finds
these
innumerable
little
vanities
to
quiet
it
and
help
it
my
soul
has
no
vanity
and
it
has
nothing
nothing
to
quiet
it
my
soul
is
wearing
itself
out
eating
itself
away
these
vanities
are
a
miserable
substitute
for
the
treasures
that
it
sees
a
great
way
off
and
even
imagines
in
its
folly
that
it
may
have
if
it
continues
to
reach
after
them
yet
the
vanities
are
something
they
prevent
my
erratic
analytical
mind
from
finding
a
great
nothing
when
it
turns
back
upon
itself
if
i
were
not
so
unceasingly
engrossed
with
my
sense
of
misery
and
loneliness
my
mind
would
produce
beautiful
wonderful
logic
i
am
a
genius
a
genius
a
genius
even
after
all
this
you
may
not
realize
that
i
am
a
genius
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
show
but
for
myself
i
feel
it
it
is
enough
for
me
that
i
feel
it
i
am
not
a
genius
because
i
am
foreign
to
everything
in
the
world
nor
because
i
am
intense
nor
because
i
suffer
one
may
be
all
of
these
and
yet
not
have
this
marvelous
perceptive
sense
my
genius
is
because
of
nothing
it
was
born
in
me
as
germs
of
evil
were
born
in
me
and
mine
is
a
genius
that
has
been
given
to
no
one
else
the
genius
itself
enables
me
to
be
thoroughly
convinced
of
this
it
is
hopeless
loneliness
my
ancestors
in
their
highlands
some
of
them
were
endowed
with
second
sight
my
genius
is
not
in
the
least
like
second
sight
that
savors
of
the
supernatural
the
mysterious
my
genius
is
a
sound
sure
earthly
sense
with
no
suggestion
of
mystery
or
occultism
it
is
an
inner
sense
that
enables
me
to
feel
and
know
things
that
i
could
not
possibly
put
into
thought
much
less
into
words
it
makes
me
know
and
analyze
with
deadly
minuteness
every
keen
tiny
damnation
in
my
terrible
lonely
life
it
is
a
mirror
that
shows
me
myself
and
something
in
myself
in
a
merciless
brilliant
light
and
the
sight
at
once
sickens
and
maddens
me
and
fills
me
with
an
unnamed
woe
it
is
something
unspeakably
dreadful
the
sight
for
the
time
deadens
all
thought
in
my
mind
it
freezes
my
reason
and
intellect
logic
can
not
come
to
my
aid
i
can
only
feel
and
know
the
thing
and
it
analyzes
itself
before
my
eyes
i
am
alone
with
this
alone
alone
alone
there
is
no
pitiful
hand
extended
from
the
heights
there
is
no
human
being
ah
there
is
nothing
how
can
i
bear
it
oh
i
ask
you
how
can
i
bear
it
march
my
genius
is
an
element
by
itself
and
it
is
not
a
thing
that
i
can
tell
in
so
many
words
but
it
makes
itself
felt
in
every
point
of
my
life
this
book
would
be
a
very
different
thing
if
i
were
not
a
genius
though
i
am
not
a
literary
genius
often
people
who
come
in
contact
with
me
and
hear
me
utter
a
few
commonplace
remarks
feel
at
once
that
i
am
extraordinary
i
am
extraordinary
i
have
tried
longingly
passionately
to
think
that
even
this
sand
and
barrenness
is
mine
but
i
can
not
i
know
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
it
like
all
good
things
is
beyond
me
it
has
something
that
i
also
have
in
that
is
our
bond
of
sympathy
but
the
sand
and
barrenness
itself
is
not
mine
always
i
think
there
is
but
one
picture
in
the
world
more
perfect
in
its
art
than
the
picture
of
me
in
my
sand
and
barrenness
it
is
the
picture
of
the
christ
crucified
with
two
thieves
nothing
could
be
more
divinely
appropriate
the
art
in
it
is
ravishingly
perfect
it
is
one
of
the
few
perfect
pictures
set
before
the
world
for
all
time
as
i
see
it
before
my
mind
i
can
think
only
of
its
utter
perfectness
i
can
summon
no
feeling
of
grief
at
the
deed
the
deed
and
the
art
are
perfect
its
perfectness
ravishes
my
senses
and
within
me
i
feel
that
the
picture
of
me
in
my
sand
and
barrenness
knowing
that
even
the
sand
and
barrenness
is
not
mine
is
only
second
to
it
march
sometimes
when
i
go
out
on
the
barrenness
my
mind
wanders
afar
it
went
to
greece
oh
it
was
very
beautiful
in
greece
there
was
a
wide
long
sky
that
was
vividly
wonderfully
blue
and
there
was
a
limitless
sea
that
was
gray
and
green
and
it
went
far
to
the
south
the
sky
and
the
sea
spread
out
into
the
vast
world
two
beautiful
elements
and
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
and
the
farther
away
they
were
the
nearer
they
moved
together
until
at
last
they
met
and
clasped
each
other
in
the
far
distance
there
were
tall
trees
of
kinds
that
are
seen
only
in
greece
they
murmured
and
whispered
in
the
stillness
the
wind
came
off
from
the
sea
and
went
over
them
and
around
them
they
quivered
and
trembled
in
shy
ecstatic
joy
for
the
wind
was
their
there
were
banks
of
moss
of
a
deep
emerald
color
and
golden
flowers
that
drooped
their
heavy
sensual
heads
over
to
the
damp
black
earth
and
they
also
loved
each
other
and
were
with
each
other
and
were
glad
clouds
hung
low
over
the
sea
and
were
and
heavy
with
rain
but
the
sun
shone
from
behind
them
at
intervals
with
beams
of
three
white
rocks
rose
up
out
of
the
sea
and
the
beams
fell
upon
them
and
straightway
they
were
of
gold
oh
how
beautiful
were
those
three
gold
rocks
that
came
up
out
of
the
sea
aphrodite
once
came
up
out
of
this
same
sea
she
came
gleaming
with
golden
hair
and
beautiful
eyes
her
skin
glowed
with
tints
of
carmine
and
wild
rose
her
white
feet
touched
the
smooth
yellow
sand
on
the
shore
the
white
feet
of
aphrodite
on
the
yellow
sand
made
a
picture
of
marvelous
beauty
she
was
flushed
in
the
joy
of
new
life
but
the
sunshine
on
the
three
white
rocks
was
more
beautiful
than
aphrodite
i
stood
on
the
shore
and
looked
at
the
rocks
my
heart
contracted
with
the
pain
that
beautiful
things
bring
the
in
the
wide
gray
and
green
sea
this
is
the
gateway
of
heaven
i
said
to
myself
behind
those
three
gold
rocks
there
is
music
and
the
high
notes
of
happy
my
soul
grew
faint
and
there
is
no
sand
and
barrenness
there
and
no
nothingness
and
no
bitterness
and
no
hot
blinding
tears
and
there
are
no
little
children
and
no
lonely
young
women
oh
there
is
no
loneliness
at
all
my
soul
grew
more
and
more
faint
with
thinking
of
it
and
there
is
no
heart
there
but
that
is
pure
and
joyous
and
in
peace
in
long
still
eternal
peace
and
every
life
comes
there
to
its
own
and
every
is
answered
and
every
is
ended
and
the
dark
spirit
of
sorrow
that
hangs
always
over
the
earth
is
gone
gone
beyond
the
gateway
of
heaven
and
more
than
all
love
is
there
and
walks
among
the
dwellers
love
is
a
shining
figure
with
radiant
hands
and
it
touches
them
all
with
its
hands
so
that
love
enters
into
their
hearts
and
the
love
of
each
for
another
is
like
the
love
of
each
for
self
and
here
at
last
is
truth
there
is
searching
and
searching
over
the
earth
after
truth
and
who
has
found
it
but
here
is
it
beyond
the
gateway
of
heaven
those
who
enter
in
know
that
it
is
truth
at
and
so
peace
and
love
and
truth
are
there
behind
the
three
gold
rocks
and
then
my
soul
could
no
longer
endure
the
thought
of
it
suddenly
the
sun
passed
behind
a
heavy
cloud
and
the
faded
from
the
three
rocks
and
left
them
white
very
white
in
the
wide
water
the
yellow
flowers
laid
their
heads
drowsily
down
on
the
emerald
moss
the
wind
from
off
the
sea
played
very
gently
among
the
motionless
branches
of
the
tall
trees
the
blue
blue
sky
and
the
wide
sea
clasped
each
other
more
closely
and
mingled
with
each
other
and
became
one
vague
shadowy
element
and
from
it
all
i
brought
my
eyes
back
thousands
of
leagues
to
my
sand
and
barrenness
the
sand
and
barrenness
is
itself
an
element
and
i
have
known
it
a
long
long
time
march
everything
is
so
dreary
so
dreary
i
feel
as
if
i
would
like
to
die
i
should
not
be
the
tiniest
bit
less
unhappy
afterward
but
this
life
is
unutterably
weary
i
am
not
strong
i
can
not
bear
things
i
do
not
want
to
bear
things
i
do
not
long
for
strength
i
want
to
be
happy
when
i
was
very
little
it
was
cold
and
dreary
also
but
i
was
certain
it
would
be
different
when
i
should
grow
and
be
ten
years
old
it
must
be
very
nice
to
be
ten
i
thought
and
one
would
not
be
nearly
so
lonesome
but
when
the
years
passed
and
i
was
ten
it
was
just
exactly
as
lonesome
and
when
i
was
ten
everything
was
very
hard
to
understand
but
it
will
surely
be
different
when
i
am
seventeen
i
said
i
will
know
so
much
when
i
am
seventeen
but
when
i
was
seventeen
it
was
even
more
lonely
and
everything
was
still
harder
to
understand
and
again
i
said
faintly
everything
will
become
clearer
in
a
few
years
more
and
i
will
wonder
to
think
how
stupid
i
have
always
been
but
now
the
few
years
more
have
gone
and
here
i
am
in
loneliness
that
is
more
hopeless
and
harder
to
bear
than
when
i
was
very
little
still
i
wonder
indeed
to
think
how
stupid
i
have
been
and
now
i
am
not
so
stupid
i
do
not
tell
myself
that
it
will
be
different
when
i
am
for
i
know
that
it
will
not
be
different
i
know
that
it
will
be
the
same
dreariness
the
same
nothingness
the
same
loneliness
it
is
very
very
lonely
it
is
hope
deferred
and
maketh
the
heart
sick
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
why
was
i
ever
born
i
can
not
live
and
i
can
not
die
for
what
is
there
after
i
am
dead
i
can
see
myself
wandering
in
dark
and
lonely
places
yet
i
feel
as
if
i
would
like
to
die
march
if
it
were
pain
alone
that
one
must
bear
one
could
bear
it
one
could
lose
one
s
sense
of
everything
but
pain
but
it
is
pain
with
other
things
it
is
the
sense
of
pain
with
the
sense
of
beauty
and
the
sense
of
the
anemone
and
there
is
that
mysterious
pain
who
knows
the
name
of
that
mysterious
pain
it
is
these
mingled
senses
that
torture
me
march
i
have
been
placed
in
this
world
with
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
and
i
ask
for
life
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
is
it
so
strange
should
i
be
content
merely
to
see
and
to
hear
there
are
other
things
for
other
people
is
it
atrocious
that
i
should
ask
for
some
other
things
also
is
thy
servant
a
dog
march
in
these
days
of
approaching
emotional
nature
even
the
sand
and
barrenness
begins
to
stir
and
rub
its
eyes
my
sand
and
barrenness
is
clothed
in
the
awful
majesty
of
countless
ages
it
stands
always
through
the
march
of
the
living
and
the
dead
it
may
have
been
green
once
green
and
fertile
and
birds
and
snakes
and
everything
that
loves
green
growing
things
may
have
lived
in
it
it
may
have
sometime
been
rolling
prairie
it
may
have
been
submerged
in
floods
it
changed
and
changed
in
the
centuries
now
it
is
sand
and
barrenness
and
there
are
no
birds
and
no
snakes
only
me
but
whatever
change
came
to
it
whatever
its
transfiguration
the
spirit
of
it
never
moved
flood
or
fertility
or
rolling
prairie
or
barrenness
it
is
only
itself
it
has
a
great
self
a
wonderful
self
i
shall
never
forget
you
my
sand
and
barrenness
some
day
shall
my
thirsty
life
be
watered
my
starved
heart
fed
my
asking
voice
answered
my
tired
soul
taken
into
the
warmth
of
another
with
the
intoxicating
sweetness
of
love
it
may
be
but
i
shall
remember
the
sand
and
barrenness
that
is
with
me
in
my
nothingness
the
sand
and
barrenness
and
the
memory
of
the
anemone
lady
are
all
that
are
in
any
degree
mine
and
so
then
i
shall
remember
it
as
i
stand
among
the
barren
gulches
in
these
days
and
look
away
at
the
hills
of
montana
i
hear
the
high
swelling
song
of
the
world
as
i
listen
i
know
that
there
are
things
other
than
the
virtue
and
the
truth
and
the
love
that
are
not
for
me
there
is
beyond
me
like
these
the
unbreaking
undying
bond
of
human
fellowship
a
thing
that
is
it
is
beyond
me
and
it
is
nothing
to
me
in
my
intensest
desires
in
my
widest
longings
i
never
go
beyond
the
ego
is
the
all
limitless
legions
of
women
and
men
in
weariness
and
in
joy
are
one
they
are
killing
each
other
and
torturing
each
other
and
going
down
in
sorrow
to
the
dust
but
they
are
one
their
right
hands
are
joined
in
unseen
sympathy
and
kinship
but
my
two
hands
are
apart
and
clasped
together
in
an
agony
of
loneliness
i
have
read
of
women
who
have
been
strongly
grandly
brave
sometimes
i
have
dreamed
that
i
might
be
brave
the
possibilities
of
this
life
are
magnificent
to
be
saturated
with
this
agony
i
say
at
times
and
to
bear
with
it
all
not
to
sink
beneath
it
but
to
vanquish
it
and
to
make
it
the
grace
and
comeliness
of
my
entire
life
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
perhaps
a
woman
a
real
woman
could
do
this
but
i
no
i
am
not
real
i
do
not
seem
to
myself
in
such
things
as
these
my
life
is
a
blank
there
was
charlotte
corday
a
heroine
whom
i
admire
above
all
the
heroines
and
more
than
she
was
a
heroine
she
was
a
woman
and
she
had
her
agony
it
was
for
love
of
her
fair
country
to
suffer
and
do
and
die
for
love
of
something
it
is
glorious
what
must
be
the
exalted
ecstasy
of
charlotte
corday
s
soul
now
and
i
with
all
my
manifold
passions
i
am
a
coward
i
have
had
moments
when
vaguely
and
from
far
off
it
seemed
as
if
there
might
be
bravery
and
exaltation
for
me
when
i
could
rise
far
over
myself
i
have
felt
unspeakable
possibilities
while
they
lasted
what
wonderful
emotion
was
it
that
i
felt
but
they
are
not
real
they
fade
away
they
fade
away
and
again
come
the
varied
phenomena
of
my
life
to
bewilder
and
terrify
me
confusion
chaos
damnation
they
are
not
moments
of
exaltation
now
poor
little
mary
maclane
if
to
do
were
as
easy
as
to
know
what
were
good
to
do
chapels
had
been
churches
and
poor
men
s
cottages
princes
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
i
do
not
know
what
were
good
to
do
i
would
do
nothing
if
i
knew
i
might
add
to
my
litany
this
most
kind
devil
deliver
me
from
myself
march
i
walked
over
the
sand
and
it
was
almost
beautiful
the
sun
was
sinking
and
the
sky
was
filled
with
roses
and
gold
then
came
my
soul
and
confronted
me
my
soul
is
wondrous
fair
it
is
like
a
young
woman
the
beauty
of
it
is
too
great
for
human
eyes
to
look
upon
it
is
too
great
for
mine
yet
i
look
my
soul
said
to
me
i
am
i
answered
and
i
am
we
may
be
well
said
my
soul
why
are
we
not
well
how
may
we
be
well
i
asked
we
may
throw
away
all
our
vanity
and
false
pride
said
my
soul
we
way
take
on
a
new
life
we
may
learn
to
wait
and
to
possess
ourselves
in
patience
we
may
labor
and
we
can
do
none
of
these
things
i
cried
have
i
not
tried
all
of
them
some
time
in
my
short
life
and
have
i
not
waited
and
wanted
until
you
have
become
faint
with
pain
have
i
not
looked
and
longed
dear
soul
why
do
you
not
resign
yourself
why
can
you
not
stay
quiet
and
trouble
yourself
and
me
no
more
why
are
you
always
straining
and
reaching
there
isn
t
anything
for
you
you
are
wearing
yourself
my
soul
made
answer
i
may
strain
and
reach
until
only
one
worn
nerve
of
me
is
left
and
that
one
nerve
may
be
scourged
with
whips
and
burned
with
fire
but
i
will
keep
one
atom
of
faith
i
may
go
bad
but
i
will
keep
one
atom
of
faith
in
love
and
in
the
truth
that
is
love
you
are
a
genius
but
i
am
no
genius
the
years
a
million
of
years
may
do
their
utmost
to
destroy
the
single
nerve
they
may
lash
and
beat
it
i
will
keep
my
one
atom
of
you
are
not
wise
i
said
you
have
been
wandering
and
longing
for
a
time
that
seems
a
thousand
years
through
my
cold
dark
childhood
to
my
cold
dark
womanhood
is
that
not
enough
to
quiet
you
is
that
not
enough
to
teach
you
the
lesson
of
nothing
you
are
not
a
genius
but
you
are
not
a
i
will
keep
my
one
atom
of
faith
said
my
soul
but
lie
and
sleep
now
i
said
don
t
reach
after
that
light
any
more
let
us
both
sleep
a
few
no
said
my
soul
oh
my
soul
i
wailed
look
away
at
that
glowing
copper
horizon
and
beyond
it
let
us
go
there
now
and
take
an
infinite
rest
now
we
can
bear
this
no
no
said
my
soul
we
will
stay
here
and
bear
more
there
would
be
no
rest
yet
beyond
the
copper
horizon
and
there
is
no
need
of
going
anywhere
i
have
my
one
atom
of
i
gazed
at
my
soul
as
it
stood
plainly
before
me
weak
and
worn
and
faint
in
the
fading
light
it
had
one
atom
of
faith
it
said
and
tried
to
hold
its
head
high
and
to
look
strong
and
triumphant
oh
the
irony
the
pathos
of
it
my
soul
with
its
one
pitiful
atom
of
faith
looked
only
what
it
was
a
weeping
hunted
thing
march
in
some
rare
it
is
as
if
nothing
mattered
my
heart
aches
i
say
my
soul
wanders
this
person
or
that
person
was
repelled
but
nothing
matters
a
great
inner
languor
comes
like
a
giant
and
lays
hold
of
me
i
lie
fallow
beneath
it
some
one
forgot
me
in
the
giving
of
things
but
it
does
not
matter
i
feel
nothing
persons
say
to
me
don
t
analyze
any
more
and
you
will
not
be
unhappy
when
something
throws
heavy
clubs
at
you
and
you
are
hit
by
them
don
t
be
hurt
when
something
stronger
than
you
holds
your
hands
in
the
fire
don
t
let
it
burn
you
when
something
pushes
you
into
a
river
of
ice
don
t
be
cold
when
something
draws
a
cutting
lash
across
your
naked
shoulders
don
t
let
it
concern
you
don
t
be
conscious
that
it
is
there
this
is
great
wisdom
and
fine
clear
logic
it
is
a
pity
that
no
one
has
ever
yet
been
able
to
live
by
it
but
after
all
it
s
no
matter
nothing
is
any
one
s
affair
it
is
all
of
no
consequence
and
have
i
not
had
all
my
anguish
for
nothing
i
am
a
fool
a
fool
a
handful
of
rich
black
mud
in
a
pig
s
yard
does
it
wonder
why
it
is
there
does
it
torture
itself
about
the
other
mud
around
it
and
about
the
earth
and
water
of
which
it
is
made
and
about
the
pig
only
fool
s
mud
would
do
so
and
so
then
i
am
fool
s
mud
nothing
counts
nothing
can
possibly
count
regret
passion
cowardice
hope
bravery
unrest
pain
the
the
the
all
for
nothing
what
can
a
handful
of
rich
black
mud
in
a
pig
s
yard
have
to
do
with
these
i
am
a
handful
of
rich
black
mud
a
fool
s
mud
all
on
earth
that
i
need
to
do
is
to
lie
still
in
the
hot
sun
and
feel
the
pig
rolling
and
floundering
and
slushing
about
it
were
folly
to
waste
my
mud
nerves
in
wondering
be
quiet
let
things
be
your
soul
is
a
fool
soul
and
is
governed
by
the
pig
your
heart
is
a
fool
heart
and
wants
nothing
beyond
the
pig
your
life
is
a
fool
life
and
is
the
pig
s
life
something
within
me
shrieks
now
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
nor
why
it
shrieks
it
groans
and
moans
there
is
no
satisfaction
in
being
a
fool
no
satisfaction
at
all
march
but
yes
it
all
matters
whether
or
no
nature
is
one
long
battle
and
the
perishing
of
the
weak
i
must
grind
and
grind
away
i
have
no
choice
and
i
must
know
that
i
grind
fool
genius
young
lonely
woman
i
must
go
round
and
round
in
the
life
within
for
how
many
years
the
devil
knows
after
that
my
soul
must
go
round
and
round
for
how
many
centuries
the
devil
knows
what
a
is
that
of
the
devil
the
world
is
a
wondrous
scheme
for
me
it
is
a
scheme
that
is
black
with
woe
but
there
may
be
in
the
world
some
one
who
finds
it
beautiful
real
life
i
wonder
as
i
write
this
portrayal
if
there
will
be
one
person
to
read
it
and
see
a
thing
that
is
mingled
with
every
word
it
is
something
that
you
must
feel
that
must
fascinate
you
the
like
of
which
you
have
never
before
met
with
it
is
the
unparalleled
individuality
of
me
i
wish
i
might
write
it
in
so
many
words
of
english
but
that
is
not
possible
if
i
have
put
it
in
every
word
and
if
you
feel
it
and
are
fascinated
then
i
have
done
very
well
i
am
marvelously
clever
if
i
have
done
so
i
know
that
i
am
marvelously
clever
but
i
have
need
of
all
my
peculiar
genius
to
show
you
my
individuality
my
aloneness
i
am
alone
out
on
my
sand
and
barrenness
i
should
be
alone
if
my
sand
and
barrenness
were
crowded
with
a
thousand
people
each
filled
with
melting
sympathy
for
me
though
it
would
be
unspeakably
sweet
people
say
of
me
she
s
they
do
not
understand
me
if
they
did
they
would
say
so
oftener
and
with
emphasis
and
so
i
try
to
put
my
individuality
in
the
quality
of
my
diction
in
my
method
of
handling
words
my
conversation
plainly
shows
this
individuality
more
than
shows
it
indeed
my
conversation
hurls
it
violently
at
people
s
heads
my
conversation
when
i
choose
makes
people
turn
around
in
their
chairs
and
stare
and
give
me
all
of
their
attention
they
admire
me
though
their
admiration
is
mixed
decidedly
with
other
feelings
i
like
to
be
admired
it
soothes
my
vanity
when
you
read
this
portrayal
you
will
admire
me
you
will
surely
have
to
admire
me
and
so
this
is
life
and
everything
matters
but
just
now
i
will
stop
writing
and
go
downstairs
to
my
dinner
there
is
a
porterhouse
steak
broiled
rare
and
some
green
young
onions
oh
they
are
good
and
when
one
is
to
have
a
porterhouse
steak
for
one
s
dinner
and
some
green
young
onions
one
doesn
t
give
a
tupenny
dam
whether
anything
else
matters
or
not
march
on
a
day
when
the
sky
is
like
lead
and
a
dull
tempestuous
wilderness
of
gray
clouds
adds
a
dreariness
to
the
sand
there
is
added
to
the
loneliness
of
my
life
a
deep
bitterness
of
gall
and
wormwood
out
of
my
bitterness
it
is
easy
for
bad
to
come
surely
badness
is
a
deep
black
pool
wherein
one
may
drown
dullness
and
nothingness
i
do
not
know
badness
well
it
is
something
material
that
seems
a
great
way
off
now
but
that
might
creep
nearer
and
nearer
as
i
became
less
and
less
young
but
now
when
the
day
is
of
the
leaden
dullness
i
look
at
badness
and
long
for
it
i
am
young
and
all
alone
and
everything
that
is
good
is
beyond
my
reach
but
all
that
is
bad
surely
that
is
within
the
reach
of
every
one
i
wish
for
a
long
pageant
of
bad
things
to
come
and
whirl
and
rage
through
this
strange
leaden
life
of
mine
and
break
the
spell
why
should
it
not
be
badness
instead
of
death
death
it
seems
will
bring
me
but
a
change
of
agony
badness
would
perhaps
so
crowd
my
life
with
its
vivid
phenomena
that
they
would
act
as
a
neurotic
to
the
racked
nerves
of
my
nothingness
it
would
be
an
outlet
and
possibly
i
could
forget
some
things
i
think
just
now
of
a
woman
who
lived
long
ago
and
in
whom
the
world
at
large
seems
not
to
have
found
anything
admirable
i
mean
messalina
valeria
the
wife
of
the
stupid
emperor
claudius
i
have
conceived
a
profound
admiration
for
this
historic
wanton
she
may
not
indeed
have
had
anything
to
forget
she
may
not
have
suffered
but
she
had
the
strength
of
will
to
take
what
she
wanted
to
do
as
she
liked
to
live
as
she
chose
to
live
it
is
admirable
and
beautiful
beyond
expression
to
sacrifice
and
give
up
and
wait
for
love
of
that
good
that
gives
in
itself
a
just
reward
and
only
next
to
this
is
the
throwing
to
the
winds
of
all
restraint
when
the
good
holds
itself
aloof
and
gives
nothing
we
are
weak
contemptible
fools
who
do
not
grasp
the
resources
within
our
reach
when
there
is
no
just
reward
for
our
restraint
why
do
we
not
take
what
we
want
of
the
various
temptations
it
is
not
that
we
are
virtuous
it
is
that
we
are
cowards
and
it
is
worth
while
to
remain
true
to
an
ideal
that
offers
only
the
vaguest
hopes
of
realization
it
is
not
philosophy
when
one
has
made
up
one
s
mind
that
one
wants
a
dish
of
hot
stewed
mushrooms
and
set
one
s
heart
on
it
should
one
scorn
a
handful
of
raw
evaporated
apples
if
one
were
starving
for
the
sake
of
the
phantom
dish
of
hot
stewed
mushrooms
should
one
say
let
me
starve
but
i
will
never
descend
to
evaporated
apples
i
will
have
nothing
but
a
dish
of
hot
stewed
mushrooms
if
one
is
sure
one
will
have
the
stewed
mushrooms
finally
before
one
dies
of
starvation
then
very
well
one
should
wait
for
them
and
take
nothing
else
but
it
is
not
in
my
good
peripatetic
philosophy
to
pass
by
the
badness
that
the
gods
provide
for
the
sake
of
a
ideal
however
brilliant
however
beautiful
however
golden
when
the
lead
is
in
the
sky
and
in
my
life
a
vision
of
badness
looms
up
on
the
horizon
and
looks
at
me
and
beckons
with
a
fascinating
finger
then
i
say
to
myself
what
is
the
use
of
this
unsullied
struggling
soul
this
unbesmirched
empty
heart
this
treasureless
innocent
mind
this
insipid
maid
there
are
no
good
things
for
them
but
here
to
be
sure
are
fascinating
glittering
bad
things
the
goods
that
the
gods
provide
the
compensation
of
the
devil
comes
death
some
day
i
said
but
to
die
in
the
sight
of
glittering
bad
things
and
i
only
nineteen
these
glittering
things
appear
fair
there
is
really
nothing
evil
in
the
world
some
things
appear
distorted
and
unnatural
because
they
have
been
badly
done
had
they
been
perfect
in
conception
and
execution
they
would
strike
one
only
with
admiration
at
their
fine
iridescent
lights
you
remember
don
juan
and
haidee
that
to
be
sure
was
not
evil
in
any
event
they
loved
each
other
but
if
they
had
had
only
a
passing
if
intense
fancy
for
one
another
who
would
call
it
evil
who
would
call
it
anything
but
wonderful
charming
enchanting
the
devil
s
bad
things
like
the
devil
s
good
things
may
gleam
and
glisten
oh
how
they
may
gleam
and
glisten
i
have
seen
them
do
so
not
only
in
a
poem
of
byron
s
but
in
the
life
that
is
always
when
the
lead
is
in
the
sky
i
would
like
to
cultivate
thoroughly
this
branch
of
the
vineyard
now
doesn
t
it
make
you
shiver
to
think
of
this
dear
little
mary
maclane
wandering
unloved
through
dark
and
deadly
labyrinths
it
makes
me
shiver
but
it
needn
t
if
i
am
to
wander
unloved
why
not
as
well
wander
there
as
through
nothingness
i
fancy
it
must
be
wonderfully
easy
to
become
used
to
the
badness
i
have
lived
my
nineteen
years
in
the
midst
of
nothingness
and
i
have
not
yet
become
used
to
it
it
has
sharp
knives
in
it
has
nothingness
badness
may
have
some
sharp
knives
also
but
there
are
other
things
yes
there
are
other
things
kind
devil
if
you
are
not
to
fetch
me
happiness
then
slip
off
from
your
great
steel
a
bright
little
key
to
the
door
of
the
glittering
gleaming
bad
things
and
give
it
me
and
show
me
the
way
and
wish
me
joy
i
would
like
to
live
about
seven
years
of
judicious
badness
and
then
death
if
you
will
nineteen
years
of
damnable
nothingness
seven
years
of
judicious
badness
and
then
death
a
noble
ambition
but
might
it
not
be
worse
if
not
that
then
nineteen
years
of
damnable
nothingness
and
then
death
no
when
the
lead
is
in
the
sky
that
does
not
appeal
to
me
my
versatile
mind
turns
to
the
seven
years
of
judicious
badness
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
without
its
element
of
badness
it
is
in
literature
it
is
in
every
art
in
pictures
sculpture
even
in
music
there
are
certain
fine
deep
minute
passages
in
beethoven
and
in
chopin
that
tell
of
things
wonderfully
sublimely
bad
chopin
one
can
not
understand
is
there
any
one
in
the
world
who
can
understand
him
but
we
know
at
once
that
there
is
the
badness
and
it
is
music
there
is
the
element
of
badness
in
me
i
long
to
cultivate
my
element
of
badness
badness
compared
to
nothingness
is
beautiful
and
so
then
i
wait
also
for
some
one
to
come
over
the
hill
with
things
other
than
happiness
but
whatever
i
wait
for
nothing
comes
march
there
were
pictures
in
the
red
sunset
sky
i
looked
at
them
and
was
racked
with
passions
of
desire
i
fancied
to
myself
that
i
could
have
any
of
the
good
things
in
the
pictures
for
the
asking
and
the
waiting
the
while
i
knew
that
when
the
sunset
should
fade
from
the
sky
i
would
be
overwhelmed
by
my
heaviest
woe
there
was
a
picture
of
intense
peace
there
were
stretches
of
flat
green
country
and
and
aspens
and
a
still
still
lake
in
the
dim
distance
you
could
see
fields
of
wheat
and
that
moved
a
little
as
if
in
the
wind
you
could
fancy
the
cows
feeding
just
below
the
brow
of
the
near
hills
and
a
hawk
floating
and
wheeling
among
the
clouds
a
rainbow
arched
over
the
lake
there
is
nothing
lacking
here
i
thought
life
and
health
and
peace
give
me
this
kind
devil
there
was
a
picture
of
endless
limitless
strength
there
were
the
again
but
bereft
now
of
every
leaf
and
the
bristling
jagged
rocks
back
of
them
were
not
more
coldly
staunch
the
sun
poured
brilliantly
bright
upon
them
a
river
flowed
unmoved
and
quiet
between
yellow
clay
banks
a
tornado
might
sweep
over
this
and
not
one
twig
would
be
displaced
not
one
ripple
would
come
to
the
river
is
it
not
fine
i
said
to
myself
no
feeling
no
no
aching
no
pain
and
the
strength
of
the
philistines
oh
kind
devil
i
entreat
you
let
me
have
that
there
was
a
picture
of
untrammeled
revel
and
forgetfulness
there
were
fields
of
swaying
daffodils
and
red
lilies
the
young
shrubs
tossed
their
heads
and
were
joyous
lambs
gamboled
and
the
happy
knew
whereof
she
sang
the
winds
with
wonder
whist
smoothly
the
waters
be
carefree
be
be
wicked
above
all
forget
the
deeds
are
what
you
will
the
time
is
now
the
aftermath
is
nothing
the
day
of
reckoning
is
never
love
things
lightly
take
all
that
you
see
and
to
the
winds
with
regret
gracious
devil
i
whispered
intensely
give
me
this
and
no
other
there
was
a
picture
of
raging
elements
the
winds
blew
and
the
rains
descended
and
the
floods
the
sky
was
overcast
with
rolling
clouds
the
air
was
heavy
with
unrest
there
was
a
gray
stone
house
set
upon
a
rocky
point
and
i
had
momentary
glimpses
of
an
unquiet
sea
below
it
back
on
the
surface
of
the
land
slender
trees
were
waving
wildly
in
the
gale
the
wind
and
the
rain
were
saying
damn
you
little
earth
i
have
you
now
i
will
rend
and
ruin
they
whipped
and
raged
in
frenzied
joy
the
little
earth
liked
it
the
elements
whirled
and
whistled
round
the
gray
stone
house
a
lurid
light
came
from
a
ghastly
moon
between
clouds
the
entire
scene
was
desolately
savage
and
forlorn
but
attractive
as
i
listened
in
fancy
to
that
shrieking
wailing
wind
and
saw
green
branches
jerked
and
twisted
asunder
in
the
storm
my
barren
defrauded
heart
leaped
and
exulted
if
i
could
live
in
the
midst
of
this
and
be
beaten
and
shaken
roughly
would
not
that
deep
sense
forget
to
ache
kind
devil
pray
send
me
some
storms
it
is
nothingness
that
bears
down
heavy
there
was
a
picture
of
an
exalted
spiritual
life
there
was
that
strange
bright
light
and
the
things
in
the
picture
were
those
things
alone
in
this
world
that
are
real
and
the
only
things
that
count
the
old
soft
green
of
the
old
old
rolling
hills
was
the
green
of
love
the
and
the
love
that
comes
from
beyond
the
earth
the
air
and
the
blue
water
and
the
sunshine
were
so
beautifully
real
and
true
that
except
for
their
passionate
tenderness
human
strength
could
not
endure
them
there
were
lanes
of
climbing
vines
and
white
violets
was
it
my
fancy
that
brought
their
thin
fragrance
to
me
over
piles
of
billowy
clouds
there
was
something
there
that
was
old
old
as
the
race
those
green
valleys
were
the
same
as
when
the
mists
first
lifted
from
the
earth
as
i
looked
my
life
stood
still
my
soul
shivered
faintly
as
i
looked
i
felt
nearer
my
god
to
thee
though
i
have
no
god
and
everything
is
away
from
me
nothing
tender
comes
to
me
still
it
was
nearer
my
god
to
thee
a
voice
came
out
of
the
far
far
distant
ages
and
said
very
gently
all
these
shadows
are
falling
in
vain
you
are
blinded
and
bewildered
in
the
darkness
the
darkness
is
deep
deep
there
is
not
one
dim
ray
of
light
your
feet
falter
and
stumble
you
can
not
see
but
the
shadows
are
falling
in
i
ask
you
why
is
this
life
not
mine
i
implore
and
wring
my
hands
in
agonized
entreaty
and
almost
it
seems
sometimes
my
fingers
can
grasp
these
things
but
there
is
something
cold
and
strong
between
them
and
me
oh
what
is
it
there
was
a
picture
of
various
castles
in
spain
they
were
most
beautiful
were
those
castles
the
lights
that
shone
on
the
battlements
were
soft
bright
lights
for
one
thing
i
fancied
i
saw
myself
and
fame
with
me
fame
is
very
fine
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
may
go
dark
in
the
heavens
bitter
rain
may
fall
out
of
the
clouds
but
never
mind
fame
has
a
sun
and
moon
and
gently
brilliant
stars
of
her
own
and
these
shining
once
shine
always
the
green
river
may
run
dry
in
the
land
but
fame
has
a
green
river
that
never
runs
dry
one
may
wander
over
the
face
of
the
earth
but
fame
is
herself
a
refuge
one
may
be
a
target
for
stones
and
mud
yes
but
fame
stands
near
with
her
arm
laid
across
one
s
shoulders
as
no
other
arm
can
be
laid
across
one
s
shoulders
fame
would
fill
several
empty
places
fame
would
continue
to
fill
them
for
some
years
fame
if
you
please
devil
there
was
a
picture
of
death
i
saw
a
figure
lying
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
that
was
rather
like
my
sand
and
barrenness
not
far
off
a
wolf
sat
on
his
haunches
and
waited
for
the
end
a
buzzard
perched
near
and
waited
also
they
both
appeared
hungry
it
seemed
as
though
the
end
might
come
quickly
let
it
come
kind
devil
and
a
wolf
and
a
buzzard
are
better
than
an
undertaker
and
some
worms
although
that
doesn
t
much
matter
and
oh
there
again
was
the
dearest
picture
of
all
the
red
red
picture
of
happiness
for
me
happiness
with
the
sunshine
falling
on
the
hills
there
was
i
and
i
loved
and
was
loved
i
out
of
loneliness
into
perfect
happiness
the
of
the
glorious
hot
sun
melted
and
poured
over
the
earth
and
over
everything
that
was
there
the
river
ran
and
rippled
and
sang
the
most
sweetly
glad
song
that
ever
river
sang
winged
things
sparkled
in
the
gold
light
and
flew
down
the
sky
the
wonderful
air
was
over
me
the
wonderful
wind
was
shaking
the
the
silent
voices
in
the
air
rang
out
like
flutes
and
clarionets
and
the
love
of
the
for
me
was
everywhere
above
me
around
me
within
me
it
would
last
for
a
number
of
beautiful
days
i
out
of
the
anguish
of
loneliness
into
this
my
heart
is
filled
with
desire
my
soul
is
filled
with
passion
my
life
is
a
life
of
longing
all
pictures
fade
before
this
picture
they
fade
completely
when
the
sun
itself
faded
i
gazed
over
my
sand
and
barrenness
with
blurred
unseeing
eyes
and
wished
only
with
a
heavy
desolate
spirit
for
the
coming
of
the
devil
march
some
people
think
absurdly
enough
that
to
be
scotch
or
descended
from
the
scottish
clans
is
to
be
rather
strong
rather
conservative
firm
in
faith
and
all
that
the
idea
is
one
that
should
be
completely
exploded
by
this
time
i
think
that
the
scotch
as
a
nation
are
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
characterize
their
traits
and
tendencies
cover
a
wider
field
than
those
of
any
other
to
be
scotch
is
to
be
anything
there
is
no
man
so
narrow
as
a
scotchman
there
is
no
man
so
broad
as
a
scotchman
there
is
no
mind
so
versatile
as
a
scotch
mind
at
the
same
time
only
a
scotch
mind
is
capable
of
clinging
with
tenacity
to
one
idea
a
scotch
heart
out
of
all
and
through
all
can
be
true
as
death
a
scotch
heart
the
same
one
can
be
cunning
and
treacherous
as
false
human
hearts
are
made
to
be
english
is
to
have
limits
the
germans
the
french
the
russians
they
have
all
some
inevitable
attributes
to
modify
their
genius
but
one
may
be
anything
anything
if
one
is
scotch
always
i
think
of
the
cruel
hardened
ferocious
kilted
clan
maclean
wandering
over
bleak
winter
hills
fighting
the
powerful
macdonalds
and
macgregors
and
generally
wiping
them
from
the
earth
marching
away
with
merrily
shrieking
pipes
from
fields
of
withered
heather
and
all
this
merely
to
gather
intensified
life
for
me
i
feel
that
the
causes
of
my
tragedy
began
long
long
ago
from
remote
germs
my
scotch
blood
added
to
my
genius
sense
has
made
me
into
a
dangerous
chemical
compound
by
analyzing
i
have
brought
an
almost
clear
portrait
of
myself
up
before
my
mind
s
eyes
when
i
was
a
child
i
did
not
analyze
knowingly
but
the
child
was
this
same
genius
though
i
am
one
of
the
kind
that
changes
widely
and
decidedly
in
the
years
this
weary
unhappiness
is
not
a
matter
of
development
when
i
was
a
child
i
felt
dumbly
what
i
feel
now
less
dumbly
at
the
age
of
five
i
used
sometimes
to
weep
silently
in
the
night
i
did
not
know
why
it
was
that
i
felt
my
aloneness
my
foreignness
to
all
things
i
felt
the
heavy
heavy
weight
of
life
and
i
was
only
five
i
was
only
five
and
it
seems
a
thousand
years
ago
but
sometimes
back
through
the
long
winding
unused
passages
of
my
mind
i
hear
that
silent
sobbing
of
the
child
and
the
unarmed
wailing
of
a
tiny
tired
soul
it
mingles
with
the
bitter
nothingness
of
the
grown
young
woman
and
oh
with
it
all
with
it
all
i
am
so
unhappy
there
is
something
subtly
in
all
this
but
scotch
or
indian
or
japanese
there
is
no
stopping
of
the
pain
march
i
fear
do
you
know
fine
world
that
you
do
not
yet
know
me
really
well
particularly
me
of
the
flesh
me
of
the
peculiar
philosophy
and
the
unhappy
spirit
you
know
rather
well
by
now
unless
you
are
stupider
than
i
think
you
are
but
you
might
pass
me
in
the
street
you
might
spend
the
day
with
me
and
never
suspect
that
i
am
i
though
for
the
matter
of
that
even
if
i
had
set
before
you
a
most
graphic
and
minutely
drawn
portrait
of
myself
i
am
certainly
clever
enough
to
act
a
quite
different
rôle
if
i
chose
when
you
came
to
spend
the
day
still
if
the
world
at
large
is
to
know
me
as
i
desire
it
to
know
me
without
ever
seeing
me
i
shall
have
to
bring
myself
into
closer
personal
range
with
it
and
you
may
rise
in
your
seats
and
focus
your
stare
with
open
mouths
stand
on
your
and
gape
i
will
myself
turn
on
glaring
green
and
orange
lights
from
the
wings
i
believe
that
it
s
the
trivial
little
facts
about
anything
that
describe
it
the
most
effectively
in
vanity
fair
when
beckey
sharpe
was
describing
young
crawley
in
a
letter
to
her
friend
amelia
she
stated
that
he
had
whiskers
and
hair
and
knowing
this
you
feel
that
you
know
much
more
about
the
crawley
than
you
would
if
miss
sharpe
had
not
mentioned
those
things
and
yet
it
is
but
a
mere
matter
of
color
when
you
think
that
dickens
was
extremely
fond
of
cats
you
feel
at
once
that
nothing
could
be
more
fitting
somehow
that
marvelously
mingled
humor
and
pathos
and
gentle
irony
seem
to
go
exceedingly
well
with
a
fondness
for
soft
purring
things
if
you
had
not
read
the
pathetic
humor
but
knew
about
dickens
and
his
warm
feline
friends
you
might
easily
expect
such
things
from
him
when
you
read
somewhere
that
johnson
is
said
never
to
have
washed
his
neck
and
his
ears
and
then
go
and
read
some
of
his
powerful
original
philosophy
you
say
to
yourself
yes
i
can
readily
believe
that
this
man
never
troubled
himself
to
wash
his
neck
and
his
i
for
my
part
having
read
some
of
the
things
he
has
written
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
the
fact
that
he
ever
washed
any
part
of
his
anatomy
i
admire
johnson
though
i
wash
my
own
neck
occasionally
when
you
think
of
napoleon
amusing
himself
by
taking
a
child
on
his
knee
and
pinching
it
to
hear
it
cry
you
feel
an
ecstatic
little
wave
of
pleasure
at
the
perfect
fitness
of
things
you
think
of
his
hard
brilliant
continuous
victories
and
you
suspect
that
napoleon
bonaparte
lived
but
to
gratify
napoleon
bonaparte
when
you
think
of
the
heavy
muscular
man
smilingly
pinching
the
child
you
are
quite
sure
of
it
such
a
method
of
amusement
for
that
king
among
men
is
so
exquisitely
appropriate
that
you
wonder
why
you
had
not
thought
of
it
yourself
so
then
yes
i
believe
strenuously
in
the
efficacy
of
seemingly
trivial
facts
as
portrayers
of
one
s
character
one
s
individual
humanness
now
i
will
set
down
for
your
benefit
divers
and
varied
observations
relative
to
me
an
interesting
one
of
womankind
and
nineteen
years
and
curious
and
fascinating
withal
well
then
nearly
every
day
i
make
me
a
plate
of
hot
rich
fudge
with
brown
sugar
i
should
be
an
entirely
different
person
if
i
made
it
with
white
sugar
and
the
fudge
would
not
be
nearly
so
good
and
take
it
upstairs
to
my
room
with
a
book
or
a
newspaper
my
mind
then
takes
in
a
part
of
what
is
contained
in
the
book
or
the
newspaper
and
the
stomach
of
the
maclane
takes
in
all
of
what
is
contained
in
the
plate
i
sit
by
my
window
in
a
miserable
uncomfortable
chair
but
i
relieve
the
strain
by
resting
my
feet
on
the
edge
of
the
low
bureau
usually
the
book
that
i
read
is
an
old
dilapidated
bound
volume
of
that
erstwhile
periodical
our
young
it
is
a
thing
that
possesses
a
charm
for
me
i
never
grow
tired
of
it
as
i
eat
my
nice
brown
little
squares
of
fudge
i
read
about
a
boy
whose
name
is
jack
hazard
and
who
trowbridge
informs
the
reader
is
doing
his
best
and
who
seems
to
find
it
somewhat
difficult
i
believe
i
could
repeat
pages
of
trowbridge
from
memory
and
that
ancient
bound
volume
has
become
a
part
of
my
life
i
stop
reading
after
a
few
minutes
but
i
continue
to
eat
and
gaze
at
the
toes
of
my
shoes
which
need
polishing
badly
or
at
the
conglomeration
of
brilliant
pictures
on
my
bedroom
wall
or
out
of
the
window
at
the
children
playing
in
the
street
but
mostly
i
gaze
without
seeing
and
my
versatile
mind
is
engaged
either
in
nothing
or
in
repeating
something
over
and
over
such
as
but
the
sweet
face
of
lucy
gray
will
never
more
be
only
i
am
not
aware
that
i
have
been
repeating
it
until
i
happen
to
remember
it
afterward
always
the
fudge
is
very
good
and
i
eat
and
eat
with
unabated
relish
until
all
the
little
squares
are
gone
a
very
little
of
my
fudge
has
been
known
to
give
some
people
a
most
terrific
but
my
own
digestive
organs
seem
to
like
nothing
better
it
s
so
brown
so
rich
i
amuse
myself
with
this
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
then
i
go
downstairs
and
work
awhile
there
are
few
things
that
annoy
me
so
much
as
to
be
called
a
young
lady
i
am
no
lady
as
any
one
could
see
by
close
inspection
and
the
phrase
has
an
odious
sound
i
would
rather
be
called
a
sweet
little
thing
or
a
fallen
woman
or
a
sensible
girl
though
they
would
each
be
equally
a
lie
always
i
am
glad
when
night
comes
and
i
can
sleep
my
mind
works
busily
repeating
things
while
i
divest
myself
of
my
various
dusty
garments
as
i
remove
a
dozen
or
two
of
hairpins
from
my
head
i
say
within
me
you
are
old
father
william
one
would
hardly
suppose
that
your
eye
is
as
steady
as
ever
yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
end
of
your
nose
what
made
you
so
awfully
clever
always
i
take
a
little
clock
to
bed
with
me
and
hang
it
by
a
cord
at
the
head
of
my
bed
for
company
i
have
named
the
clock
little
fido
because
it
is
so
constant
and
ticks
always
it
is
beginning
to
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
me
as
trowbridge
s
magazine
if
i
were
to
go
away
from
here
i
should
take
little
fido
and
the
magazine
with
me
every
morning
being
beautifully
hungry
after
my
walk
i
eat
three
boiled
eggs
out
of
the
shell
for
my
breakfast
the
while
i
mentally
thank
the
kind
providence
that
invented
hens
also
i
eat
bits
of
toast
i
have
my
breakfast
alone
because
the
rest
of
the
family
are
still
sleeping
sitting
at
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
table
i
enjoy
those
three
eggs
and
those
bits
of
toast
usually
when
i
am
eating
my
breakfast
i
am
thinking
of
three
things
the
varying
price
of
any
eggs
that
are
fit
to
eat
of
what
to
do
after
i
ve
finished
my
housework
and
before
lunch
and
of
my
one
friend
and
i
meditatively
and
gently
kick
the
leg
of
the
table
with
the
heel
of
my
right
foot
i
have
beautiful
hair
in
the
front
of
my
there
are
nine
cambric
handkerchiefs
cunningly
distributed
my
figure
is
very
pretty
to
be
sure
but
not
so
well
developed
as
it
will
be
in
five
years
if
i
live
so
long
and
so
i
help
it
out
materially
with
nine
cambric
handkerchiefs
you
can
see
by
my
picture
that
my
waist
curves
gracefully
out
only
it
is
not
all
flesh
some
of
it
is
handkerchief
it
amuses
me
to
do
this
it
is
one
of
my
petty
vanities
likewise
by
an
ingenious
arrangement
of
my
striped
moreen
petticoat
i
contrive
to
display
a
more
evident
pair
of
hips
than
nature
seems
to
have
intended
for
me
at
this
stage
doubtless
they
also
will
take
on
fuller
proportions
when
some
years
have
passed
still
i
am
not
dissatisfied
with
them
as
they
are
it
is
not
as
if
they
were
too
well
developed
in
which
case
i
should
have
need
of
all
my
skill
in
arranging
my
moreen
petticoat
so
as
to
lessen
their
effect
it
is
easy
enough
to
add
on
to
these
things
but
one
would
experience
serious
difficulty
in
attempting
to
take
from
them
i
hate
that
heavy
aggressive
kind
of
hips
moreover
small
graceful
ones
are
desirable
when
one
is
nineteen
the
world
at
large
judges
you
more
leniently
on
that
account
usually
narrow
shapely
hips
may
give
one
an
effect
of
youth
and
harmlessness
which
is
a
distinct
advantage
when
for
instance
one
is
writing
a
portrayal
and
so
will
be
at
the
world
s
mercy
i
believe
i
should
not
think
of
attempting
to
write
a
portrayal
if
i
had
hips
like
a
pair
of
certainly
it
would
avail
me
nothing
sometimes
i
look
at
my
face
in
a
mirror
and
find
it
not
plain
but
ugly
and
there
are
other
times
when
i
look
and
find
it
not
pretty
but
beautiful
with
a
sweetness
i
told
you
i
might
say
more
about
the
liver
that
is
within
me
before
i
have
done
well
then
i
will
say
this
that
the
world
if
it
had
a
liver
like
mine
would
be
very
different
from
what
it
is
the
world
would
be
and
mobile
and
passionate
and
nervous
and
and
intensely
alive
and
poetic
and
romantic
and
philosophical
and
egotistic
and
pathetic
and
oh
racked
to
the
verge
of
madness
with
the
spirit
of
unrest
if
the
world
had
a
liver
like
mine
it
is
not
all
of
these
now
it
is
rather
stupid
gods
and
little
fishes
would
not
the
world
be
wonderful
if
all
in
it
were
like
me
and
it
would
be
if
it
had
a
liver
like
mine
for
it
is
my
liver
mostly
that
makes
me
what
i
am
apart
from
my
genius
my
liver
is
fine
and
perfect
but
sensitive
and
well
it
s
a
dangerous
thing
to
have
within
you
it
is
the
liver
of
the
maclanes
it
is
the
foundation
of
the
curious
castle
of
my
existence
and
after
all
fine
brave
stupid
world
you
may
be
grateful
to
the
devil
that
yours
is
not
like
it
i
have
seventeen
little
engraved
portraits
of
napoleon
that
i
keep
in
one
of
my
often
late
in
the
evening
between
nine
and
ten
o
clock
when
i
come
in
from
a
walk
over
the
sand
and
barrenness
i
take
these
pictures
from
the
drawer
and
gaze
at
them
carefully
a
long
time
and
think
of
that
man
until
i
am
stirred
to
the
depths
and
then
easily
and
naturally
i
fall
in
love
with
napoleon
if
only
he
were
living
now
i
think
to
myself
i
would
make
my
way
to
him
by
whatever
means
and
cast
myself
at
his
feet
i
would
entreat
him
with
the
most
passionate
humbleness
of
spirit
to
take
me
into
his
life
for
three
days
to
be
the
wife
of
napoleon
for
three
days
that
would
be
enough
for
a
lifetime
i
would
be
much
more
than
satisfied
if
i
could
get
three
such
days
out
of
life
i
suppose
a
man
is
either
a
villain
or
a
fool
though
some
of
them
seem
to
be
a
judicious
mingling
of
both
the
type
of
the
distinct
villain
is
preferable
to
a
mixture
of
the
two
and
to
a
plain
fool
i
like
a
villain
anyway
a
villain
that
can
be
rather
tender
at
times
and
so
then
as
i
look
at
the
pictures
i
fall
in
love
with
the
incomparable
napoleon
the
seventeen
pictures
are
all
different
and
all
alike
i
fall
in
love
with
each
picture
separately
in
one
he
is
ugly
and
unattractive
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
another
he
is
cruel
and
heartless
and
utterly
selfish
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
a
third
he
has
a
fat
pudgy
look
and
is
quite
insignificant
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
a
fourth
he
is
grandly
sad
and
full
of
despair
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
fifth
he
is
greasy
and
greedy
and
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
sixth
he
is
masterly
and
superior
and
exalted
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
seventh
he
is
romantic
and
beautiful
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
eighth
he
is
obviously
sensual
and
reeking
with
uncleanness
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
ninth
he
is
unearthly
and
mysterious
and
unreal
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
tenth
he
is
black
and
and
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
eleventh
he
is
inferior
and
trifling
and
inane
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
twelfth
he
is
rough
and
ruffianly
and
uncouth
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
thirteenth
he
is
little
and
wolfish
and
vile
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
fourteenth
he
is
calm
and
confident
and
intellectual
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
fifteenth
he
is
vacillating
and
fretful
and
his
mouth
is
like
a
woman
s
and
still
he
is
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
sixteenth
he
is
slow
and
heavy
and
brutal
and
strong
i
fall
in
love
with
him
in
the
seventeenth
he
is
rather
tender
and
strong
i
fall
vividly
in
love
with
him
napoleon
was
rather
like
the
devil
i
think
as
i
sit
in
the
chair
with
my
feet
on
the
bureau
and
gaze
long
and
intently
at
the
seventeen
pictures
late
in
the
evening
then
i
wearily
put
them
away
maddened
with
the
sense
of
nothingness
and
take
little
fido
and
go
to
bed
sometimes
early
in
the
evening
just
before
dinner
i
sit
in
the
chair
with
my
elbows
on
the
and
my
head
resting
on
one
hand
and
i
look
out
of
the
window
at
a
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
these
are
in
the
vacant
lot
next
to
this
house
i
fix
my
eyes
intently
on
the
pile
of
stones
and
the
barrel
of
lime
and
i
fix
my
thoughts
on
them
also
and
some
of
my
widest
thoughts
come
to
me
then
i
feel
an
overwhelming
wave
of
a
kind
of
pantheism
which
at
the
moment
i
feel
it
begins
slowly
to
grow
less
and
less
and
continues
in
this
until
finally
it
dwindles
to
a
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
i
feel
at
the
moment
that
the
universe
is
a
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
they
alone
are
the
real
things
take
anything
at
any
point
and
deceive
yourself
into
thinking
that
you
are
happy
with
it
but
look
at
it
heavily
dig
down
underneath
the
layers
and
layers
of
mists
and
you
will
find
that
your
thing
is
a
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
a
struggle
or
two
a
fight
an
agony
a
passing
and
then
the
only
real
things
a
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
damn
everything
afterward
you
will
find
that
you
have
done
all
your
damning
for
naught
for
there
is
nothing
worthy
of
damnation
except
a
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
and
they
are
not
damnable
they
have
never
harmed
you
and
moreover
they
alone
are
the
real
things
julius
caesar
made
many
wars
sir
francis
drake
went
sailing
over
the
seas
it
was
all
child
s
play
and
counts
for
nothing
here
are
the
pile
of
stones
and
a
barrel
of
lime
and
so
this
is
how
it
is
early
in
the
evening
just
before
dinner
when
i
sit
in
the
uncomfortable
chair
with
my
elbows
on
the
and
my
head
resting
on
one
hand
i
have
two
pictures
of
marie
bashkirtseff
high
upon
my
wall
often
i
lean
my
head
on
the
back
of
the
chair
with
my
feet
on
the
bureau
always
with
my
feet
on
the
bureau
and
look
at
these
pictures
in
one
of
them
she
is
eighteen
years
old
and
wears
a
green
frock
which
is
extremely
becoming
of
which
fact
the
person
inside
of
it
seems
fully
aware
the
other
picture
is
taken
from
her
last
photograph
when
she
was
marie
bashkirtseff
is
a
very
beautiful
creature
and
evidently
is
not
obliged
to
arrange
a
moreen
petticoat
over
her
plumpness
she
has
a
wonderfully
voluptuous
look
for
a
woman
of
eighteen
years
in
the
later
picture
vanity
is
written
in
every
line
of
her
graceful
form
and
in
every
feature
of
that
charming
face
the
picture
fairly
yells
i
am
marie
bashkirtseff
and
oh
i
am
splendid
and
as
i
look
at
the
pictures
i
am
glad
for
though
she
was
admirable
and
splendid
and
all
she
was
no
such
genius
as
i
she
had
a
genius
of
her
own
it
is
true
but
the
bashkirtseff
with
her
voluptuous
body
and
her
attractive
personality
is
after
all
a
bit
ordinary
my
genius
though
not
powerful
is
rare
and
deep
and
no
one
has
ever
had
or
ever
will
have
a
genius
like
it
mary
maclane
if
you
live
if
you
live
my
darling
the
world
will
one
day
recognize
your
genius
and
when
once
the
world
has
recognized
such
genius
as
this
oh
then
no
one
will
ever
think
of
profaning
it
by
comparing
it
with
any
bashkirtseff
but
i
would
give
up
this
genius
eagerly
gladly
at
once
and
forever
for
one
dear
bright
day
free
from
loneliness
the
portraits
of
the
bashkirtseff
are
certainly
beautiful
but
there
is
something
about
them
that
is
well
not
common
but
bourgeois
at
least
as
if
she
were
a
german
waitress
of
unusual
appearance
or
an
aristocratic
or
a
nurse
with
good
taste
who
would
walk
out
on
pleasant
forenoons
wheeling
a
something
of
that
sort
perhaps
it
is
because
her
neck
is
too
short
or
because
her
wrists
are
too
i
thank
a
gracious
devil
as
i
look
up
at
the
pictures
that
i
have
not
those
particular
points
and
that
particular
bourgeois
air
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
have
one
of
my
own
but
mine
is
highland
scotch
and
anyway
i
am
mary
maclane
marie
bashkirtseff
is
beautiful
enough
however
that
she
can
easily
afford
to
look
rather
i
like
to
look
at
my
two
pictures
of
her
i
value
money
literally
for
its
own
sake
i
like
the
feeling
of
dollars
and
quarters
rubbing
softly
together
in
my
hand
always
it
reminds
me
of
those
lovely
chestfuls
of
gold
that
captain
kidd
buried
no
one
seems
to
know
just
where
usually
i
keep
some
dollars
and
quarters
to
handle
money
is
so
nice
i
say
to
myself
if
you
think
fine
world
that
i
am
always
interesting
and
striking
and
admirable
always
original
showing
up
to
good
advantage
in
a
company
of
persons
and
all
why
then
you
are
beautifully
mistaken
there
are
times
to
be
sure
when
i
can
rivet
the
attention
of
the
crowd
heavily
upon
myself
but
mostly
i
am
the
very
least
among
all
the
idiots
and
fools
i
show
up
to
the
poorest
possible
advantage
of
several
ways
that
are
mine
there
is
one
that
gives
me
a
distinct
and
hopeless
air
of
insignificance
i
have
seen
people
having
met
me
for
the
first
time
glance
carelessly
at
me
as
if
they
were
quite
sure
i
had
not
an
idea
in
my
brain
if
i
had
a
brain
as
if
they
wondered
why
i
had
been
asked
there
as
if
they
were
fully
aware
that
they
had
but
to
fiddle
and
it
would
dance
sometimes
before
this
highly
intellectual
gathering
breaks
up
i
manage
to
make
them
change
their
minds
with
astonishing
suddenness
but
nearly
always
i
don
t
bother
about
it
at
all
i
go
among
people
occasionally
because
it
amuses
me
it
may
be
a
literary
club
where
they
talk
theosophy
or
it
may
be
a
cornish
dance
where
they
have
pasty
and
saffron
cake
and
the
chief
amusement
is
sending
at
various
heads
or
it
may
be
a
circle
of
married
women
with
cerise
silk
and
white
kid
gloves
drinking
chocolate
in
the
afternoon
and
talking
about
something
shocking
and
often
as
i
say
i
am
the
least
of
them
genius
is
an
odd
thing
when
certain
of
my
skirts
need
sewing
they
don
t
get
sewed
i
simply
pin
the
rents
in
them
together
and
it
lasts
as
long
or
longer
than
if
i
had
seated
myself
in
my
chair
with
a
needle
and
thread
and
mended
them
like
a
sensible
girl
i
hate
a
sensible
girl
though
i
have
never
yet
hurriedly
pinned
up
a
torn
flounce
or
several
inches
of
without
saying
softly
to
myself
using
a
trite
expressive
phrase
certainly
it
s
a
hell
of
a
way
to
still
i
never
take
a
needle
and
mend
my
garments
i
couldn
t
anyway
i
never
learned
to
sew
and
i
don
t
intend
ever
to
learn
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
a
constipated
dressmaker
and
so
i
pin
up
the
torn
places
though
as
i
say
i
never
fail
to
make
use
of
the
quaint
expressive
phrase
all
of
which
a
reasonably
astute
reader
will
recognize
as
an
important
point
in
the
portraying
of
any
character
whether
mine
or
the
queen
of
spain
s
i
had
for
my
dinner
some
bread
some
and
some
green
green
early
asparagus
while
i
was
eating
these
the
world
seemed
a
very
nice
place
indeed
i
never
see
people
walking
along
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
as
i
sit
by
my
window
without
wondering
who
they
are
and
how
they
live
and
how
ugly
they
would
look
if
their
bodies
were
not
adorned
with
clothes
always
i
feel
certain
that
some
of
them
are
and
sometimes
i
see
a
woman
in
a
fearful
state
of
deshabille
walk
across
the
vacant
lot
next
to
this
a
plague
on
me
i
say
then
to
myself
if
i
ever
become
and
if
my
entire
being
seems
to
tip
up
in
the
front
and
if
i
go
about
with
no
stays
so
that
when
i
tie
an
apron
around
my
waist
my
upper
fatness
hangs
over
the
band
like
a
natural
and
so
i
could
go
on
writing
all
night
these
seemingly
trivial
but
really
significant
details
relating
to
the
outer
genius
but
these
will
answer
these
to
any
one
who
knows
things
will
be
a
revelation
sometimes
you
know
things
fine
brave
world
you
must
know
likewise
that
though
i
do
ordinary
things
when
do
them
they
cease
to
be
ordinary
i
make
fudge
and
a
sweet
girl
makes
fudge
but
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
doing
things
this
entire
affair
of
the
fudge
is
one
of
my
uniquest
points
no
sweet
girl
makes
fudge
and
eats
it
as
i
make
fudge
and
eat
it
so
it
is
but
oh
who
is
to
understand
all
this
who
will
understand
any
of
this
portrayal
my
unhappy
soul
has
delved
in
shadows
far
far
beyond
and
below
march
my
philosophy
i
find
after
very
little
analysis
approaches
precariously
near
to
sensualism
it
is
wonderful
how
many
sides
there
can
be
to
just
one
character
nature
with
all
those
suns
and
all
those
hilltops
and
all
those
rivers
and
all
those
stars
is
inscrutable
intangible
maddening
it
affects
one
with
unutterable
joy
and
anguish
but
no
one
can
ever
begin
to
understand
what
it
means
human
nature
is
yet
more
inscrutable
and
nothing
appears
on
the
surface
one
can
have
no
idea
of
the
things
buried
in
the
minds
of
one
s
acquaintances
and
mostly
they
are
fools
and
have
no
idea
themselves
of
what
germs
are
in
themselves
of
what
they
are
capable
and
in
most
minds
it
is
true
the
dormant
devils
never
awaken
and
never
are
known
it
is
another
sign
of
my
analytical
genius
that
i
aged
nineteen
recognize
the
devils
in
my
character
i
have
not
the
slightest
wish
since
things
are
as
they
are
with
me
to
rid
myself
of
them
there
is
in
me
much
more
of
evil
than
of
good
genius
like
mine
must
needs
have
with
it
manifold
bad
i
have
in
me
the
germ
of
every
i
have
no
desire
to
destroy
these
germs
i
should
be
glad
indeed
to
have
them
develop
into
a
ravaging
disease
something
in
this
dreadful
confusion
would
then
give
way
my
wooden
heart
and
my
soul
would
cry
out
in
the
darkness
less
heavily
less
bitterly
they
want
something
they
know
not
what
i
give
them
poison
they
snatch
it
and
eat
it
hungrily
then
they
are
not
so
hungry
they
become
quieter
the
ravaging
disease
soothes
them
to
sleep
it
descends
on
them
like
rain
in
the
autumn
when
i
hurry
over
my
sand
and
barrenness
my
vivid
passions
come
to
me
or
when
i
sit
and
look
at
the
horizon
when
i
walk
slowly
i
consider
calmly
the
question
of
how
much
evil
i
should
need
to
kill
off
my
finer
feelings
to
poison
thoroughly
this
soul
of
unrest
and
this
wooden
heart
so
that
they
would
never
more
be
conscious
of
lights
and
to
make
myself
over
into
a
quite
different
creature
a
little
evil
would
do
a
little
of
a
fine
good
quality
i
should
like
a
man
to
come
it
is
always
a
man
have
you
ever
noticed
whatever
one
contemplates
when
one
is
of
womankind
and
young
i
should
like
a
man
to
come
i
said
calmly
to
myself
as
i
walked
slowly
over
my
barrenness
a
perfect
villain
to
come
and
fascinate
me
and
lead
me
with
strong
gentle
allurements
to
what
would
be
technically
termed
my
ruin
and
as
the
world
views
such
things
it
would
be
my
ruin
but
as
i
view
such
things
it
would
not
be
ruin
it
would
be
a
new
lease
on
life
yes
i
should
like
a
man
to
come
any
man
so
that
he
is
strong
and
thoroughly
a
villain
and
so
that
he
fascinates
me
particularly
he
must
fascinate
me
there
must
be
no
falling
in
love
about
it
i
doubt
if
i
could
fascinate
him
but
i
should
ask
him
quite
humbly
to
lead
me
to
my
ruin
i
have
never
yet
seen
the
man
who
would
not
readily
respond
to
such
an
appeal
this
villain
would
be
no
exception
i
would
then
jerk
my
life
out
of
this
nothingness
by
the
roots
farewell
a
long
farewell
i
would
say
then
i
would
go
forth
with
the
man
to
my
ruin
the
man
would
be
bad
to
his
heart
s
core
and
after
living
but
a
short
time
with
him
my
shy
sensitive
soul
would
be
irretrievably
poisoned
and
polluted
the
defilement
of
so
sacred
and
beautiful
a
thing
as
marriage
is
surely
the
darkest
evil
that
can
come
to
a
life
and
so
everything
within
me
that
had
turned
toward
that
light
would
then
drink
deep
of
the
lees
of
death
the
thirst
of
this
incessant
unrest
and
longing
this
weariness
of
would
be
quenched
completely
my
life
would
be
like
fertile
soil
planted
thickly
with
rank
wild
mustard
on
every
square
inch
of
soil
there
would
be
a
dozen
sprouts
of
wild
mustard
there
would
be
no
room
no
room
at
all
for
an
anemone
to
grow
if
one
should
start
up
instantly
it
would
be
choked
and
overrun
with
wild
mustard
but
no
anemone
would
start
up
my
life
now
is
a
life
of
pain
and
revolt
my
life
darkened
and
partly
killed
would
be
more
than
content
to
drift
along
with
the
current
oh
it
would
be
a
rest
the
christians
sing
there
is
rest
for
the
weary
on
the
other
side
of
jordan
where
the
tree
of
life
is
blooming
but
that
rest
of
course
is
for
the
christians
my
rest
will
have
to
come
on
this
side
of
jordan
let
the
impress
of
a
thoroughly
evil
and
strong
man
be
stamped
upon
my
inner
life
and
i
am
convinced
there
would
come
a
wonderful
settled
quiet
over
it
its
spirit
would
be
broken
it
would
rest
why
not
i
have
no
nothing
to
me
is
of
any
consequence
except
to
be
rid
of
this
unrest
and
pain
yes
surely
i
might
rest
the
coming
of
the
would
bring
rest
but
i
am
fool
enough
to
think
that
marriage
the
real
marriage
is
possible
for
me
this
other
thing
is
within
the
reach
of
every
one
of
fools
and
geniuses
alike
and
of
all
that
come
between
and
so
i
want
a
fascinating
wicked
man
to
come
and
make
me
positively
rather
than
negatively
wicked
i
feel
a
terrific
wave
of
utter
weariness
my
life
lies
fallow
i
am
tired
of
sitting
here
the
sand
and
barrenness
is
gray
with
age
and
i
am
gray
with
age
happiness
the
red
of
the
sunset
sky
is
the
intensest
desire
of
my
life
but
i
will
grasp
eagerly
anything
else
that
is
offered
me
the
poisoning
of
my
soul
the
passing
of
my
unrest
would
rouse
my
mental
power
my
genius
would
receive
a
wonderful
impetus
from
it
you
would
marvel
good
world
at
the
things
i
should
write
not
that
they
would
be
exalted
not
that
they
would
surge
upward
do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
but
they
would
be
marvels
of
fire
and
intensity
i
should
no
longer
exhaust
much
of
my
energy
in
grinding
grinding
within
the
things
that
would
come
of
the
thorns
and
thistles
would
excite
your
astonishment
and
admiration
though
they
be
not
grapes
and
figs
and
as
for
me
the
real
me
the
creature
imbued
with
a
spirit
of
intense
femininity
with
a
spirit
of
an
intense
sense
of
love
with
a
spirit
like
that
of
the
magdalene
who
loved
too
much
with
the
very
soul
of
unrest
and
nothingness
this
thing
would
vanish
swiftly
into
oblivion
and
i
should
go
down
a
dark
world
and
feel
not
march
one
of
the
remarkable
points
about
my
life
is
that
it
is
so
completely
hopelessly
alone
a
lonely
lonely
life
this
book
of
mine
contains
but
one
character
myself
there
is
also
the
devil
as
a
possibility
and
there
is
also
the
anemone
lady
my
dearest
beloved
as
a
memory
i
have
read
books
that
were
written
to
portray
but
one
character
and
there
were
various
people
brought
in
to
help
in
the
portraying
but
my
one
friend
is
gone
and
there
is
no
person
who
enters
into
my
inner
life
in
the
very
least
i
am
always
alone
i
might
mingle
with
people
intimately
every
hour
of
my
life
still
i
should
be
alone
always
alone
alone
not
even
a
god
to
worship
how
do
i
bear
this
how
do
i
get
through
the
days
and
days
and
oh
when
it
all
comes
over
me
what
frightful
rage
what
long
agony
of
my
breaking
heart
what
utter
woe
when
the
stars
shine
down
upon
me
with
cold
hatred
when
miles
and
miles
of
barrenness
stretch
out
around
me
and
envelop
me
in
their
weary
weary
nothingness
when
the
wind
blows
over
me
like
the
breath
of
a
vicious
giant
when
the
ugly
ugly
sun
radiates
centuries
of
hard
heavy
bitterness
around
me
from
its
stinging
rays
when
the
sky
maddens
me
with
its
cold
careless
blue
when
the
rivers
that
are
flowing
over
the
earth
send
echoes
to
me
of
their
hateful
voices
when
i
hear
wild
geese
honking
in
bitter
wailing
melody
when
bristling
edges
of
jagged
rocks
cut
sharply
into
my
tired
life
when
drops
of
rain
fall
on
me
and
pierce
me
like
steel
points
when
the
voices
in
the
air
shriek
malice
in
my
ears
when
the
green
of
nature
is
the
green
of
spitefulness
and
cruelty
when
the
red
red
of
the
setting
sun
burns
and
consumes
me
with
its
horrid
feverish
effervescence
when
i
feel
the
of
the
universe
for
its
poor
little
then
it
is
that
i
approach
nearest
to
rest
the
softnesses
are
my
unrest
i
do
not
want
those
bitter
things
but
i
must
have
them
if
i
would
rest
i
want
the
softnesses
and
i
want
rest
oh
dear
faint
soul
it
is
hard
hard
for
us
we
are
sick
with
loneliness
march
now
and
again
i
have
torturing
glimpses
of
a
paradise
and
i
feel
my
soul
in
its
pain
every
moment
of
my
life
otherwise
how
gladly
would
i
deny
the
existence
of
a
soul
and
a
life
to
come
for
my
soul
is
beset
with
nothingness
and
the
paradise
that
shows
itself
is
not
for
me
march
hatred
after
all
is
the
easiest
thing
of
all
to
bear
if
you
have
been
forgotten
by
the
one
who
must
have
made
you
and
if
you
have
been
left
alone
of
human
beings
all
your
life
all
your
nineteen
years
then
when
at
last
you
see
some
one
looking
toward
you
with
beautiful
eyes
and
extending
to
you
a
beautiful
hand
and
showing
you
a
beautiful
heart
wherein
is
just
a
little
of
beautiful
sympathy
for
you
for
you
oh
that
is
harder
than
anything
to
bear
harder
than
the
loneliness
and
the
bitterness
and
the
tears
are
nearer
and
nearer
but
one
would
be
hurt
often
often
for
the
sake
of
the
beautiful
things
yes
one
would
gladly
be
hurt
long
and
often
i
shall
never
forget
how
it
was
with
me
when
i
first
saw
the
beautiful
eyes
of
my
dearest
anemone
lady
when
they
were
looking
gently
at
me
and
the
beautiful
hand
and
the
beautiful
heart
the
awakening
of
my
racked
soul
is
hardly
more
heavily
laden
with
passion
and
pain
i
shall
never
forget
though
i
feel
away
from
her
also
she
is
the
only
one
out
of
all
to
look
gently
at
me
let
me
writhe
and
falter
with
pain
let
me
go
mad
but
oh
worldful
of
people
for
the
love
of
your
god
give
me
out
of
this
seething
darkness
only
one
beautiful
human
hand
to
touch
mine
with
one
beautiful
human
heart
to
know
the
aching
sad
loneliness
of
mine
one
beautiful
human
soul
to
mingle
with
mine
in
long
long
rest
oh
for
a
human
being
my
soul
wails
a
human
being
to
love
me
oh
to
know
just
once
what
it
is
to
be
loved
nineteen
years
without
one
faint
shadow
of
love
is
mouldy
crumbling
age
is
gray
with
the
dust
of
centuries
how
long
have
i
lived
how
long
must
i
live
i
am
shrieking
at
you
cold
stupid
world
oh
the
long
long
waiting
the
millions
of
human
beings
i
am
a
human
being
and
there
is
no
one
no
one
no
one
who
can
know
this
that
has
not
felt
it
you
do
not
know
you
can
not
know
surely
i
do
not
ask
too
much
but
whether
or
not
it
is
too
much
i
can
not
go
through
the
years
without
it
oh
i
can
not
you
have
lived
your
nineteen
years
fine
world
and
you
have
lived
through
some
after
years
but
in
your
nineteen
years
there
was
some
one
to
love
you
it
is
that
that
counts
since
you
have
had
that
some
one
in
your
nineteen
years
can
you
understand
what
life
is
to
me
me
in
my
loneliness
my
wailing
waiting
soul
burns
with
but
one
desire
be
loved
oh
to
be
march
i
am
making
the
world
my
confessor
in
this
portrayal
my
mind
is
fairly
bursting
with
egotism
and
pain
and
in
writing
this
i
find
a
merciful
outlet
i
have
become
fond
of
my
portrayal
often
i
lay
my
forehead
and
my
lips
caressingly
upon
the
pages
and
i
wish
to
let
you
know
that
there
is
in
existence
a
genius
an
unhappy
genius
a
genius
starving
in
montana
in
the
barrenness
but
still
a
genius
i
am
a
creature
the
like
of
which
you
have
never
before
happened
upon
you
have
never
suspected
that
there
is
such
a
person
i
know
that
there
is
not
such
another
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
the
world
contains
not
my
parallel
i
am
a
fantasy
an
absurdity
a
genius
had
i
been
one
of
the
beasts
that
perish
i
had
been
likewise
a
fantasy
i
think
i
should
have
been
a
small
animal
composite
of
a
pig
a
leopard
and
a
skunk
an
animal
that
i
fancy
would
be
uncanny
to
look
upon
but
admirable
for
a
pet
however
i
am
not
one
of
the
beasts
that
perish
i
am
human
that
is
another
remarkable
point
i
have
heard
persons
say
they
can
hardly
believe
i
am
quite
human
i
am
the
most
human
creature
that
ever
was
placed
on
the
earth
the
geniuses
are
always
more
human
than
the
herd
almost
a
perfection
of
humanness
is
reached
in
me
this
by
itself
makes
me
extraordinary
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
i
find
is
the
quality
of
humanness
humanity
and
humaneness
are
much
less
rare
it
is
a
brave
thing
to
understand
something
of
what
we
indeed
it
is
an
exceeding
brave
thing
the
one
who
said
that
had
surely
gone
out
on
the
highways
and
byways
and
found
how
little
he
could
understand
to
understand
oneself
is
not
so
brave
a
thing
to
go
in
among
the
hidden
gray
shadows
of
the
deep
things
is
a
fool
s
errand
it
is
not
from
choice
that
i
do
it
no
one
carries
a
around
her
neck
from
choice
when
i
see
what
is
among
the
hidden
gray
shadows
when
i
see
a
vision
of
i
am
seized
with
a
strange
sick
terror
a
fool
s
errand
but
one
that
i
must
need
go
and
for
that
matter
i
myself
am
a
fool
yet
to
know
oneself
well
is
a
rare
fine
art
i
analyze
myself
now
i
analyzed
myself
when
i
was
three
years
old
the
only
difference
is
that
at
the
age
of
three
i
was
not
aware
that
i
analyzed
it
is
true
that
is
a
great
difference
now
i
know
that
i
am
analyzing
at
nineteen
and
now
i
know
that
i
analyzed
at
three
and
at
the
age
of
nineteen
i
know
that
i
am
a
genius
a
genius
who
does
not
know
that
he
is
a
genius
is
no
genius
a
drunken
man
might
stagger
up
to
a
piano
and
accidentally
play
music
that
vibrates
to
the
soul
that
touches
upon
the
mysteries
but
he
does
not
know
his
power
and
he
is
no
genius
though
men
awaken
and
go
mad
therefrom
i
know
that
i
am
a
genius
more
than
any
genius
that
has
lived
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
world
will
never
know
this
and
as
i
think
of
it
i
wonder
if
angels
are
not
weeping
somewhere
because
of
it
march
she
only
said
my
life
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
all
day
long
this
song
of
mariana
has
been
reeling
and
swimming
in
my
brain
i
awoke
with
it
early
in
the
morning
and
it
is
still
with
me
now
in
the
lateness
i
wondered
at
times
during
the
day
why
that
very
gentle
and
devilishly
persistent
refrain
did
not
drive
me
insane
or
send
me
into
convulsions
i
tried
vainly
to
fix
my
mind
on
a
book
i
began
reading
mill
on
the
floss
but
that
weird
poem
was
not
to
be
foiled
it
bewitched
my
brain
now
as
i
write
i
hear
twenty
voices
chanting
in
a
sad
minor
key
twenty
voices
that
fill
my
brain
with
sound
to
the
bursting
point
he
cometh
not
he
cometh
not
he
cometh
that
i
were
dead
i
am
aweary
aweary
that
i
were
dead
that
i
were
he
cometh
not
that
i
were
it
is
maddening
in
that
it
is
set
sublimely
to
the
music
of
my
own
life
now
that
i
have
written
it
i
can
hope
that
it
may
leave
me
if
it
follows
me
through
the
night
and
if
i
awake
to
another
day
of
it
the
cords
of
my
overworked
mind
will
surely
break
but
let
me
thank
the
kind
devil
it
is
leaving
me
now
it
is
as
if
tons
were
lifted
from
my
brain
april
how
can
any
one
bring
a
child
into
the
world
and
not
wrap
it
round
with
a
certain
wondrous
tenderness
that
will
stay
with
it
always
there
are
persons
whose
souls
have
never
entered
into
them
my
mother
has
some
fondness
for
me
for
my
body
because
it
came
of
hers
that
is
nothing
nothing
a
hen
loves
its
egg
a
hen
april
this
evening
in
the
dusk
i
sat
by
my
window
and
spent
an
hour
in
passionate
conversation
with
the
devil
i
fancied
i
sat
with
my
hands
folded
and
my
feet
crossed
on
an
ugly
but
comfortable
red
velvet
sofa
in
some
nondescript
room
and
the
fascinating
was
seated
near
in
a
frail
willow
chair
he
had
willingly
come
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
me
he
was
in
a
mood
and
i
amused
and
interested
him
and
for
myself
i
was
extremely
glad
to
see
the
devil
sitting
there
and
felt
vividly
as
always
but
i
sat
quietly
enough
the
fascinating
has
fascinating
eyes
and
they
looked
at
me
with
every
variety
of
glance
from
quizzical
to
tender
it
were
easy
oh
how
easy
to
follow
those
eyes
to
the
earth
s
ends
the
devil
leaned
back
in
the
frail
willow
chair
and
looked
at
me
and
now
that
i
am
here
mary
maclane
he
said
what
would
you
i
want
you
to
marry
me
i
replied
at
once
and
i
want
it
more
than
ever
anything
was
wanted
since
the
world
so
i
am
flattered
said
the
devil
and
smiled
gently
enchantingly
at
that
smile
i
was
ravished
and
transported
and
a
spasm
of
some
rare
emotion
thrilled
all
the
little
nerves
in
me
from
my
heels
to
my
forehead
and
yet
the
smile
was
not
for
me
but
rather
somewhat
at
my
expense
but
he
went
on
you
must
know
it
is
not
my
custom
to
marry
i
am
sure
it
is
not
i
agreed
and
i
do
not
ask
to
be
peculiarly
favored
anything
that
you
may
give
me
however
little
will
constitute
marriage
for
and
would
marriage
itself
be
so
small
a
thing
asked
the
devil
marriage
i
said
would
be
a
great
oh
a
wonderful
thing
and
the
most
beautiful
of
all
i
want
what
is
good
according
to
my
lights
and
because
i
am
a
genius
my
lights
are
many
and
what
do
your
lights
tell
you
the
inquired
they
tell
me
this
that
nothing
in
the
world
matters
unless
love
is
with
it
and
if
love
is
with
it
and
it
seems
to
the
virtuous
a
barren
and
infamous
thing
still
because
of
the
love
it
partakes
of
the
very
and
have
you
the
courage
of
your
convictions
he
said
if
you
offered
me
i
replied
that
which
to
the
blindly
virtuous
seems
the
worst
possible
thing
it
would
yet
be
for
me
the
red
red
line
on
the
sky
my
heart
s
desire
my
life
my
rest
you
are
the
devil
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
i
believe
you
have
said
the
devil
and
how
does
it
feel
to
be
in
love
sitting
composedly
on
the
ugly
red
velvet
sofa
with
my
hands
folded
and
my
feet
crossed
i
attempted
to
define
that
wonderful
feeling
it
feels
i
said
as
if
sparks
of
fire
and
ice
crystals
ran
riot
in
my
veins
with
my
blood
as
if
a
thousand
pierced
my
flesh
and
every
other
point
a
point
of
pleasure
and
every
other
point
a
point
of
pain
as
if
my
heart
were
laid
to
rest
in
a
bed
of
velvet
and
but
kept
awake
by
sweet
violin
arias
as
if
milk
and
honey
and
the
blossoms
of
the
cherry
flowed
into
my
stomach
and
then
vanished
utterly
as
if
strange
beautiful
worlds
lay
spread
out
before
my
eyes
alternately
in
dazzling
light
and
complete
darkness
with
chaotic
rapidity
as
if
were
sprinkled
in
the
folds
of
my
brain
as
if
sprigs
of
were
stuck
inside
my
hot
linen
collar
as
if
well
you
know
i
ended
suddenly
very
good
said
the
devil
you
are
in
love
and
you
say
you
are
in
love
with
oh
with
you
i
exclaimed
with
suppressed
violence
the
effort
to
suppress
this
violence
cost
me
pounds
of
but
i
kept
my
hands
still
quietly
folded
and
my
feet
crossed
and
it
was
a
triumph
of
i
want
you
to
marry
me
i
added
despairingly
and
you
think
he
inquired
that
apart
from
the
opinion
of
the
wise
world
it
would
be
a
suitable
marriage
a
suitable
marriage
i
exclaimed
i
hate
a
suitable
marriage
no
it
would
not
be
suitable
it
would
be
bohemian
outlandish
adorable
the
devil
smiled
this
time
the
smile
was
for
me
and
oh
the
long
old
overpowering
enchantment
of
the
smile
of
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
devil
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
one
remembers
you
are
a
beautifully
frank
little
feminine
creature
he
said
frankness
is
in
these
days
a
lost
yes
i
am
beautifully
frank
i
replied
out
of
countless
millions
of
the
devil
s
anointed
i
am
one
to
acknowledge
but
withal
you
are
not
true
said
the
i
am
a
liar
i
answered
you
are
a
liar
surely
he
said
but
you
stay
with
your
lies
to
stay
with
anything
is
it
is
so
i
replied
nevertheless
i
am
false
as
woman
can
but
you
know
what
you
oh
yes
i
said
i
know
what
i
want
i
want
you
to
marry
and
why
because
i
love
that
seems
an
excellent
reason
certainly
said
the
devil
i
want
to
be
happy
for
once
in
my
life
i
said
i
have
never
been
happy
and
if
i
could
be
happy
once
for
one
gold
day
i
should
be
satisfied
and
i
should
have
that
to
remember
in
the
long
and
you
are
a
strangely
pathetic
little
animal
said
the
devil
i
am
pathetic
i
said
i
clasped
my
hands
very
tightly
i
know
that
i
am
pathetic
and
for
this
reason
i
am
the
most
terribly
pathetic
of
all
in
the
poor
little
mary
maclane
said
the
devil
he
leaned
toward
me
he
looked
at
me
with
those
strange
wonderfully
tender
divine
eyes
poor
little
mary
maclane
he
said
again
in
a
voice
that
was
like
the
gray
dawn
and
the
eyes
the
glance
of
the
eyes
entered
into
me
and
thrilled
me
through
and
through
it
frightened
and
soothed
me
it
racked
and
comforted
me
it
ravished
me
with
inconceivable
gentleness
so
that
i
bent
my
head
down
and
sobbed
as
i
breathed
don
t
you
know
you
little
thing
said
the
your
life
will
be
very
hard
for
you
always
harder
when
you
are
happy
than
when
you
go
in
nothingness
i
know
i
know
nevertheless
i
want
to
be
happy
i
sobbed
i
felt
a
rush
of
an
old
thick
heavy
anguish
it
is
day
after
day
it
is
week
after
week
it
is
month
after
month
it
is
year
after
year
it
is
only
time
going
and
going
there
is
no
joy
there
is
no
lightness
of
heart
it
is
only
the
passing
of
days
i
am
young
and
all
alone
always
i
have
been
alone
when
i
was
five
and
lay
in
the
damp
grass
and
tortured
myself
to
keep
back
tears
and
through
the
long
cold
lonely
years
till
now
and
now
all
the
torture
does
not
keep
back
the
tears
there
is
no
one
nothing
to
help
me
bear
it
it
is
more
than
pathetic
when
one
is
nineteen
in
all
young
new
feeling
and
sees
nothing
anywhere
except
long
dark
lonely
years
behind
her
and
before
her
no
one
that
loves
me
and
long
long
i
stopped
the
gray
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
oh
they
were
the
eyes
and
they
had
a
look
in
them
the
long
bitter
pageant
of
my
nothingness
mingled
with
this
look
and
the
coming
together
of
these
was
like
the
joining
of
two
halves
i
do
not
know
which
brings
me
the
deeper
pain
the
loneliness
and
weariness
of
my
sand
and
barrenness
or
the
look
in
the
eyes
but
as
always
i
would
gladly
leave
all
and
follow
the
eyes
to
the
world
s
end
they
are
like
the
sun
s
setting
and
they
are
like
the
pale
beautiful
stars
and
they
are
like
the
shadows
of
earth
and
sky
that
come
together
in
the
dark
why
asked
the
devil
are
you
in
love
with
me
you
know
so
much
so
much
i
answered
i
think
it
must
be
that
the
wisdom
of
the
spheres
is
in
your
brain
and
so
then
you
must
understand
me
because
no
one
understands
all
these
smouldering
feelings
my
greatest
agony
is
you
must
need
know
the
very
finest
of
them
and
your
eyes
oh
it
s
no
matter
why
i
m
in
love
with
you
it
s
enough
that
i
am
and
if
you
married
me
i
would
make
you
happier
than
you
i
am
not
happy
at
all
said
the
i
am
merely
contentment
i
said
in
place
of
happiness
is
a
horrid
feeling
not
one
of
your
countless
advocates
loves
you
they
all
serve
you
faithfully
and
well
but
with
it
all
they
hate
you
always
people
hate
their
tyrant
you
are
my
tyrant
but
i
love
you
absorbingly
madly
happiness
for
me
would
be
to
live
with
you
and
see
you
made
happy
by
the
overwhelming
flood
of
my
it
interests
me
he
said
you
are
a
most
interesting
feminine
philosopher
and
your
philosophy
is
after
my
own
heart
in
its
lack
of
it
is
to
be
hoped
you
are
not
intellectual
which
is
an
unpardonable
indeed
i
am
not
i
replied
intellectual
people
are
detestable
they
have
pale
faces
and
bad
stomachs
and
bad
livers
and
if
they
are
women
their
corsets
are
sure
to
be
too
tight
and
probably
black
and
if
they
are
men
they
are
which
is
worse
and
they
never
by
any
chance
know
what
it
means
to
walk
all
day
in
the
rain
or
to
roll
around
on
the
ground
in
the
dirt
and
above
all
they
never
fall
in
love
with
the
they
are
tiresome
the
devil
agreed
if
i
were
to
marry
you
how
long
would
you
be
happy
for
three
you
are
wise
he
said
you
are
wonderfully
wise
in
some
things
though
you
are
still
very
i
am
wise
i
answered
being
of
womankind
and
nineteen
years
i
am
more
than
ready
to
give
up
absolutely
everything
that
is
good
in
the
world
s
sight
though
they
are
contemptible
things
enough
in
my
own
for
love
all
for
love
therefore
i
am
wise
also
i
am
a
why
are
you
a
fool
because
i
am
a
your
logic
is
good
logic
said
the
devil
my
logic
oh
i
don
t
care
anything
about
logic
i
said
with
sudden
complete
weariness
i
felt
buried
and
wrapped
round
and
round
in
weariness
everything
lost
its
color
everything
turned
cold
at
this
moment
said
the
devil
you
feel
as
if
you
cared
for
nothing
at
all
but
if
i
chose
i
could
bring
about
a
transfiguration
i
could
kiss
your
soul
into
i
answered
yes
without
emotion
an
hour
said
the
devil
is
not
very
long
but
we
know
it
is
long
enough
to
suffer
in
and
go
mad
in
and
live
in
and
be
happy
in
and
the
world
contains
a
great
many
hours
now
i
am
leaving
you
it
is
likely
that
i
may
never
come
again
and
it
is
likely
that
i
may
come
it
all
vanished
i
still
sat
by
my
window
in
the
gloom
it
is
dreary
i
said
but
yes
the
world
contains
a
great
many
hours
april
i
have
asked
for
bread
sometimes
and
i
have
been
given
a
stone
oh
it
is
a
bitter
thing
oh
it
is
piteous
piteous
i
find
that
i
am
not
far
apart
from
human
beings
i
can
still
be
crushed
wounded
stunned
by
the
attitude
of
human
beings
i
looked
for
and
i
was
given
coldness
i
repelled
human
beings
i
asked
for
bread
and
i
was
given
a
stone
oh
it
is
bitter
bitter
oh
is
there
a
thing
in
the
wide
world
more
bitter
where
are
you
i
am
crushed
wounded
stunned
and
oh
i
am
alone
april
i
have
a
sense
of
humor
that
partakes
of
the
divine
in
life
for
there
are
things
even
in
this
chaotic
irony
that
are
divine
my
genius
is
not
divine
my
patheticness
is
not
divine
my
philosophy
is
not
divine
nor
my
originality
nor
my
audacity
of
thought
these
are
peculiarly
of
the
earth
but
my
sense
of
humor
it
is
humor
that
is
far
too
deep
to
admit
of
laughter
it
is
humor
that
makes
my
heart
melt
with
a
high
unequaled
sense
of
pleasure
and
ripple
down
through
my
body
like
old
yellow
wine
a
rare
tone
in
a
person
s
voice
a
densely
wrathful
expression
in
a
pair
of
eyes
a
fine
fine
shade
of
comparison
and
contrast
between
a
word
in
a
conversation
and
an
angleworm
pattern
in
a
calico
these
are
things
that
make
me
conscious
of
divine
emotion
one
day
last
summer
an
italian
stopped
at
the
back
door
and
rested
herself
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
the
and
i
talked
she
had
a
dirty
white
handkerchief
tied
over
her
head
as
all
italian
do
and
she
had
a
telescope
valise
filled
with
garters
and
hairpins
and
soap
and
combs
and
pencils
and
china
buttons
on
blue
cards
and
and
tacks
and
and
and
green
glass
beads
and
there
is
something
fascinating
about
a
s
telescope
valise
this
wore
a
black
satine
wrapper
and
an
ancient
cape
she
said
that
she
would
like
to
stop
and
rest
a
while
and
i
told
her
she
might
i
had
always
wanted
to
talk
to
a
and
my
mother
never
would
allow
one

the
house

nice
to
be
a
peddler
i
asked
her

t
bad

a
great
deal
of
money

next
inquired

do

sometime

don
t
said
the
woman
she
spoke
with
an
accent

while
it
sounded
italian
still
showed
unmistakably
that
she
had
lived
in
butte
well
do
you
make
just
enough
to
live
on
or

you
saved
some
money

bank

replied

rheumatism

knees

every
joint

he
is
he
what
did
you
marry
him
for
i
asked
the
looked
at
me
with
that
look
which
seems
to
convey
the
information
that
curiosity
once
killed
a
cat
what
for
i
persisted
for
love
i
marry
him
w
en
i
was
young
girl
and
he

awfully
nice
and
did
he
say
awfully
sweet
things

you
he

dem
sweet
oh

the
she
grinned
and
i
was
and
you
liked
it
when
you
were
young
and
he
was
sweet
didn
t
you
yes
i
guess
so
i
was
young
she
answered
the
fact
that
one
is
young
seems
to
imply
in
the
italian
peddler
mind
a
lacking
in
some
essential
points
and
don
t
you
like
your
man
now
i
asked
man
he
s
all
right
in
italy
he
is
replied
the
woman
well
i
observed
if
i
had
a
man
who
had
been
dem
sweet
once
when
i
had
been
young
but
who
was
not
sweet
any
more
i
think
i
should
leave
him
in
italy
you
ll
git
a
man
some
day
soon
said
the
i
was
interested
to
know
that
they
all
do
oh
yes
she
said
but
you
likely
to
be
better
off
peddlin
i
tell
yes
i
think
it
would
be
amusing
to
be
a
peddler
for
a
while
i
said
but
i
should
want
the
man
too
as
long
as
he
was
dem
the
picked
up
the
telescope
valise
yes
she
remarked
a
man
he
s
sweet
two
days
t
ree
days
then
holy
god
he
never
work
he
drunk
he
he
raise
the
nodded
at
me
and
limped
out
of
the
yard
the
telescope
valise
was
heavy
when
she
walked
every
muscle
in
her
body
seemed
to
be
pressed
into
the
service
she
had
a
heavy
solid
look
she
seemed
as
though
she
might
weigh
three
hundred
pounds
though
she
was
not
large
the
afternoon
sun
shone
down
brightly
on
her
dirty
white
handkerchief
on
her
brown
comely
face
on
her
brown
hands
on
her
black
satine
wrapper
on
her
ancient
cape
as
i
watched
her
out
of
sight
i
thought
to
myself
two
days
t
ree
days
then
holy
god
he
never
work
he
drunk
he
he
raise
i
was
conscious
of
an
intense
humor
that
was
so
far
beyond
laughter
that
it
was
too
deep
even
for
tears
but
i
felt
tears
vaguely
as
i
watched
the
limping
up
the
road
it
was
not
pathos
it
was
humor
humor
my
emotion
was
one
of
vivid
pleasure
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
woman
and
at
the
telescope
valise
and
at
her
conversation
supplemented
by
my
own
this
emotion
is
divine
and
i
can
not
grasp
it
as
i
looked
after
the
italian
it
came
to
me
with
sudden
force
that
the
earth
is
only
the
earth
but
that
it
is
touched
here
and
there
brilliantly
with
divine
fingers
long
and
often
as
i
ve
sat
in
intense
silent
passion
and
gazed
at
the
red
red
sunset
sky
i
have
never
then
felt
this
sense
of
the
divine
it
comes
only
through
humor
it
comes
only
with
things
like
an
italian
in
a
black
satine
wrapper
and
an
ancient
cape
my
soul
how
heavily
it
goes
life
is
a
journeying
up
a
hill
and
at
the
top
we
wonder
why
we
are
there
have
mercy
on
me
i
implore
in
a
dull
idea
that
the
journey
is
so
long
so
long
and
a
human
being
is
less
than
an
atom
the
solid
heavy
figure
of
an
italian
with
a
telescope
valise
limping
away
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
is
more
convincing
of
the
things
that
are
than
would
be
the
sound
of
the
wailing
of
legions
of
lost
souls
could
it
be
heard
for
the
world
must
be
amused
and
the
world
s
wind
listeth
as
it
bloweth
april
i
write
a
great
many
letters
to
the
dear
anemone
lady
i
send
some
of
them
to
her
and
others
i
keep
to
read
myself
i
like
to
read
letters
that
i
have
written
particularly
that
i
have
written
to
her
this
is
a
letter
that
i
wrote
two
days
ago
to
my
one
friend
to
you
and
don
t
you
know
my
dearest
my
friendship
with
you
contains
other
things
it
contains
infatuation
and
worship
and
bewitchment
and
idolatry
and
a
tiny
altar
in
my
whereon
is
burning
sweet
incense
in
a
little
dish
of
blue
and
gold
yes
all
of
these
my
life
is
made
up
of
many
outpourings
all
the
outpourings
have
one
point
of
you
are
the
point
of
there
is
no
other
you
are
the
anemone
lady
you
are
the
one
whom
i
may
love
to
think
that
the
world
contains
one
beautiful
human
being
for
me
to
love
it
is
wonderful
my
life
is
longing
for
the
sight
of
you
my
senses
are
aching
for
lack
of
an
anemone
to
diffuse
itself
among
them
a
year
ago
when
you
were
in
the
high
school
often
i
used
to
go
over
there
when
you
would
be
going
home
so
that
my
life
could
be
made
momentarily
replete
by
the
sight
of
you
you
didn
t
know
i
was
there
only
a
few
times
when
i
spoke
to
you
and
now
it
is
that
i
remember
you
oh
my
dearest
you
are
the
only
one
in
the
world
we
are
two
women
you
do
not
love
me
but
i
love
you
you
have
been
wonderfully
beautifully
kind
to
me
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
ever
been
kind
to
me
there
is
something
delirious
in
this
something
of
the
nameless
quantity
it
is
old
grief
and
woe
to
live
nineteen
years
and
to
remember
no
person
ever
to
have
been
kind
but
what
is
it
do
you
think
at
the
end
of
nineteen
years
to
come
at
last
upon
one
who
is
wonderfully
beautifully
kind
those
persons
who
have
had
some
one
always
to
be
kind
to
them
can
never
remotely
imagine
how
this
feels
sometimes
in
these
spring
days
when
i
walk
miles
down
into
the
country
to
the
little
wet
gulch
of
the
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
this
thing
does
not
make
me
happy
she
is
wonderfully
beautifully
kind
i
say
to
myself
and
she
is
the
anemone
lady
she
is
kind
and
though
she
s
gone
nothing
can
ever
change
but
i
am
not
happy
oh
my
one
friend
what
is
the
matter
with
me
what
is
this
feeling
why
am
i
not
happy
but
how
can
you
know
you
are
beautiful
i
am
a
small
vile
creature
always
i
awake
to
this
fact
when
i
think
of
the
anemone
lady
i
am
not
good
but
you
are
kind
to
me
you
are
kind
to
me
you
are
kind
to
me
you
have
written
me
two
letters
the
anemone
lady
came
down
from
her
high
places
and
wrote
me
two
letters
it
is
said
that
god
is
somewhere
it
may
be
so
but
god
has
never
come
down
from
his
high
places
to
write
me
two
letters
dear
do
you
see
you
are
the
only
one
in
the
world
april
oh
the
dreariness
the
nothingness
day
after
day
week
after
week
it
is
dull
and
gray
and
weary
it
is
dull
no
one
loves
me
the
least
in
the
world
my
life
is
dreary
he
cometh
i
am
unhappy
unhappy
it
rains
the
blue
sky
is
weeping
but
it
is
not
weeping
because
i
am
unhappy
i
hate
the
blue
sky
and
the
rain
and
the
wet
ground
and
everything
this
morning
i
walked
far
away
over
the
sand
and
these
things
made
me
think
they
loved
me
and
that
i
loved
them
but
they
fooled
me
everything
fools
me
i
am
a
fool
no
one
loves
me
there
are
people
here
but
no
one
loves
me
no
one
understands
no
one
cares
it
is
i
and
the
barrenness
it
is
i
young
and
all
alone
pitiful
heaven
but
no
heaven
is
not
pitiful
heaven
also
has
fooled
me
more
than
once
there
is
something
for
every
one
that
i
have
ever
known
some
tender
thing
but
what
is
there
for
me
what
have
i
to
remember
out
of
the
long
years
the
blue
sky
is
weeping
but
not
for
me
the
rain
is
persistent
and
heavy
as
damnation
it
falls
on
my
mind
and
it
maddens
my
mind
it
falls
on
my
soul
and
it
hurts
my
everything
hurts
my
it
falls
on
my
heart
and
it
warps
the
wood
in
my
heart
of
womankind
and
nineteen
years
a
philosopher
of
the
peripatetic
school
a
thief
a
genius
a
liar
and
a
fool
and
unhappy
and
filled
with
anguish
and
hopeless
despair
what
is
my
life
oh
what
is
there
for
me
there
has
always
been
nothing
there
will
always
be
nothing
there
was
a
miserable
damnable
wretched
lonely
childhood
itself
has
passed
but
the
pain
of
it
has
not
passed
the
pain
of
it
is
with
me
and
is
added
to
the
pain
of
now
it
is
pain
that
never
lets
itself
be
forgotten
the
pain
of
the
childhood
was
the
pain
of
nothing
the
pain
of
now
is
the
pain
of
nothing
oh
the
pathetic
of
nothing
it
is
burlesque
but
it
is
none
the
less
tragedy
it
is
tragedy
that
eats
its
way
inward
it
is
only
i
and
the
sand
and
barrenness
i
have
never
a
tender
thing
in
my
life
the
sand
and
barrenness
has
never
a
i
want
a
human
being
to
love
me
i
have
need
of
it
i
am
starving
to
death
for
lack
of
it
bitterest
salt
tears
surge
upward
sobs
are
shaking
themselves
out
from
the
depths
oh
the
salt
is
bitter
i
might
lay
me
down
and
weep
all
day
and
all
night
and
the
salt
would
grow
more
bitter
and
more
bitter
but
life
in
its
nothingness
is
more
bitter
still
it
is
that
is
the
most
tragic
of
all
it
is
an
inward
dying
that
never
ends
it
is
the
bitterness
of
death
added
to
the
bitterness
of
life
what
hell
is
there
like
that
of
one
weak
little
human
being
placed
on
the
earth
and
left
there
are
people
who
live
and
enjoy
but
my
soul
and
i
we
find
life
too
bitter
and
too
heavy
to
carry
alone
too
bitter
and
too
heavy
oh
that
i
and
my
soul
might
perish
at
this
moment
forever
april
i
am
sitting
writing
out
on
my
sand
and
barrenness
the
sky
is
pale
and
faded
now
in
the
west
but
a
few
minutes
ago
there
was
the
same
miracle
of
roses
and
gold
and
glints
and
gleams
of
silver
and
green
and
a
river
in
vermilions
and
purples
and
lastly
the
dear
the
beautiful
the
red
red
line
there
also
are
heavy
black
shadows
i
have
given
my
heart
into
the
keeping
of
this
and
still
as
always
i
look
at
it
and
feel
it
all
with
thrilling
passion
and
await
the
devil
s
coming
l
envoi
october
and
so
there
you
have
my
portrayal
it
is
the
record
of
three
months
of
nothingness
those
three
months
are
very
like
the
three
months
that
preceded
them
to
be
sure
and
the
three
that
followed
them
and
like
all
the
months
that
have
come
and
gone
with
me
since
time
was
there
is
never
anything
different
nothing
ever
happens
now
i
will
send
my
portrayal
into
the
wise
wide
world
it
may
stop
short
at
the
publisher
or
it
may
fall
from
the
press
or
it
may
go
farther
indeed
and
be
its
own
undoing
that
s
as
may
be
i
will
send
it
what
else
is
there
for
me
if
not
this
book
and
oh
that
some
one
may
understand
it
i
am
not
good
i
am
not
virtuous
i
am
not
sympathetic
i
am
not
generous
i
am
merely
and
above
all
a
creature
of
intense
passionate
i
feel
everything
it
is
my
genius
it
burns
me
like
my
portrayal
in
its
analysis
and
egotism
and
bitterness
will
surely
be
of
interest
to
some
whether
to
that
one
alone
who
may
understand
it
or
to
some
who
have
themselves
been
left
alone
or
to
those
three
whom
i
on
three
dreary
days
asked
for
bread
and
who
each
gave
me
a
stone
and
whom
i
do
not
forgive
for
that
is
the
bitterest
thing
of
all
it
may
be
to
all
of
these
but
none
of
them
nor
any
one
can
know
the
feeling
made
of
relief
and
pain
and
despair
that
comes
over
me
at
the
thought
of
sending
all
this
to
the
wise
wide
world
it
is
bits
of
my
wooden
heart
broken
off
and
given
away
it
is
strings
of
amber
beads
taken
from
the
fair
neck
of
my
soul
it
is
shining
little
gold
coins
from
out
of
my
mind
s
red
leather
purse
it
is
my
little
old
it
means
everything
to
me
do
you
see
it
means
to
me
it
will
amuse
you
it
will
arouse
your
interest
it
will
stir
your
curiosity
some
sorts
of
persons
will
find
it
ridiculous
it
will
puzzle
you
but
am
i
to
suppose
that
it
will
also
awaken
compassion
in
cool
indifferent
hearts
and
will
the
sand
and
barrenness
look
so
unspeakably
gray
and
dreary
to
coldly
critical
eyes
as
to
mine
and
shall
my
bitter
little
story
fall
easily
and
comfortably
upon
undisturbed
ears
and
linger
for
an
hour
and
be
forgotten
will
the
wise
wide
world
itself
give
me
in

outstretched
hand
