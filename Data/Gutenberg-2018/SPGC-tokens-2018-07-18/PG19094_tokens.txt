the
prelude
scene
plantation

thin
young
trees
in
a
misty
and
rainy
twilight
some
woodland
blossom
showing
the
patches
on
the
earth
between
the
the
stranger
discovered
a
cloaked
figure
with
a
pointed
hood
his
costume
might
belong
to
modern
or
any
other
time
and
the
conical
hood
is
so
drawn
over
the
head
that
little
can
be
seen
of
the
distant
voice
a
woman
is
heard
unintelligible
words
the
cloaked
figure
raises
its
head
and
listens
with
interest
the
song
draws
nearer
patricia
carleon
she
is
dark
and
slight
and
has
a
dreamy
expression
though
she
is
artistically
dressed
her
hair
is
a
little
wild
she
has
a
broken
branch
of
some
flowering
tree
in
her
hand
she
does
not
notice
the
stranger
and
though
he
has
watched
her
with
interest
makes
no
sign
suddenly
she
perceives
him
and
starts
patricia
oh
who
are
you
stranger
ah
who
am
i
to
mutter
to
himself
and
maps
out
the
ground
with
his
i
have
a
hat
but
not
to
wear
i
wear
a
sword
but
not
to
slay
and
ever
in
my
bag
i
bear
a
pack
of
cards
but
not
to
play
patricia
what
are
you
what
are
you
saying
stranger
it
is
the
language
of
the
fairies
o
daughter
of
eve
patricia
but
i
never
thought
fairies
were
like
you
why
you
are
taller
than
i
am
stranger
we
are
of
such
stature
as
we
will
but
the
elves
grow
small
not
large
when
they
would
mix
with
mortals
patricia
you
mean
they
are
beings
greater
than
we
are
stranger
daughter
of
men
if
you
would
see
a
fairy
as
he
truly
is
look
for
his
head
above
all
the
stars
and
his
feet
amid
the
floors
of
the
sea
old
women
have
taught
you
that
the
fairies
are
too
small
to
be
seen
but
i
tell
you
the
fairies
are
too
mighty
to
be
seen
for
they
are
the
elder
gods
before
whom
the
giants
were
like
pigmies
they
are
the
elemental
spirits
and
any
one
of
them
is
larger
than
the
world
and
you
look
for
them
in
acorns
and
on
toadstools
and
wonder
that
you
never
see
them
patricia
but
you
come
in
the
shape
and
size
of
a
man
stranger
because
i
would
speak
with
a
woman
patricia
back
in
i
think
you
are
growing
taller
as
you
speak
scene
appears
to
fade
away
and
give
place
to
the
milieu
act
one
duke
an
apartment
with
open
french
windows
or
any
opening
large
enough
to
show
a
garden
and
one
house
fairly
near
it
is
evening
and
there
is
a
red
lamp
lighted
in
the
house
beyond
rev
cyril
smith
sitting
with
hat
and
umbrella
beside
him
evidently
a
visitor
he
is
a
young
man
with
the
highest
of
high
church
and
all
the
qualities
of
a
restrained
fanatic
he
is
one
of
the
christian
socialist
sort
and
takes
his
priesthood
seriously
he
is
an
honest
man
and
not
an
him
hastings
papers
in
his
hastings
oh
good
evening
you
are
smith
i
mean
you
are
the
rector
i
think
smith
i
am
the
rector
hastings
i
am
the
duke
secretary
his
grace
asks
me
to
say
that
he
hopes
to
see
you
very
soon
but
he
is
engaged
just
now
with
the
doctor
smith
is
the
duke
ill
hastings
oh
no
the
doctor
has
come
to
ask
him
to
help
some
cause
or
other
the
duke
is
never
smith
is
the
doctor
with
him
now
hastings
why
strictly
speaking
he
is
not
the
doctor
has
gone
over
the
road
to
fetch
a
paper
connected
with
his
proposal
but
he
has
far
to
go
as
you
can
see
that
his
red
lamp
at
the
end
of
his
grounds
smith
yes
i
know
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
will
wait
as
long
as
is
necessary
hastings
oh
it
wo
be
very
long
by
the
garden
grimthorpe
an
open
paper
he
is
an
practitioner
very
much
of
a
gentleman
and
very
carefully
dressed
in
a
slightly
antiquated
style
he
is
about
sixty
years
old
and
might
have
been
a
friend
of
doctor
up
the
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
did
not
notice
there
was
anyone
here
smith
i
beg
yours
a
new
clergyman
can
not
expect
to
be
expected
i
only
came
to
see
the
duke
about
some
local
affairs
doctor
and
so
oddly
enough
did
i
but
i
suppose
we
should
both
like
to
get
hold
of
him
by
a
separate
ear
smith
oh
there
no
disguise
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
joined
this
league
for
starting
a
model
in
the
parish
and
in
plain
words
i
come
to
ask
his
grace
for
a
subscription
to
it
doctor
and
as
it
happens
i
have
joined
in
the
petition
against
the
erection
of
a
model
in
this
parish
the
similarity
of
our
position
grows
with
every
instant
smith
yes
i
think
we
must
have
been
twins
doctor
well
what
is
a
model
do
you
mean
a
toy
smith
i
mean
a
place
where
englishmen
can
get
decent
drink
and
drink
it
decently
do
you
call
that
a
toy
doctor
no
i
should
call
that
a
conjuring
trick
or
in
apology
to
your
cloth
i
will
say
a
miracle
smith
i
accept
the
apology
to
my
cloth
i
am
doing
my
duty
as
a
priest
how
can
the
church
have
a
right
to
make
men
fast
if
she
does
not
allow
them
to
feast
doctor
and
when
you
have
done
feasting
them
you
will
send
them
to
me
to
be
cured
smith
yes
and
when
you
done
curing
them
you
send
them
to
me
to
be
buried
doctor
a
pause
well
you
have
all
the
old
doctrines
it
is
only
fair
you
should
have
all
the
old
jokes
too
smith
by
the
way
you
call
it
a
conjuring
trick
that
poor
people
should
drink
moderately
doctor
i
call
it
a
chemical
discovery
that
alcohol
is
not
a
food
smith
you
do
drink
wine
yourself
doctor
drink
wine
well
what
else
is
there
to
drink
smith
so
drinking
decently
is
a
conjuring
trick
that
you
can
do
anyhow
doctor
well
well
let
us
hope
so
talking
about
conjuring
tricks
there
is
to
be
conjuring
and
all
kinds
of
things
here
this
afternoon
smith
conjuring
indeed
why
is
that
hastings
a
letter
in
each
hastings
his
grace
will
be
with
you
presently
he
asked
me
to
deal
with
the
business
matter
first
of
all
gives
a
note
to
each
of
smith
eagerly
to
doctor
but
this
is
rather
splendid
the
duke
given
to
the
new
hastings
the
duke
is
very
liberal
doctor
his
very
but
this
is
rather
curious
he
has
also
given
to
the
league
for
opposing
the
new
hastings
the
duke
is
very
smith
at
his
i
should
call
it
doctor
down
and
lighting
a
well
yes
the
duke
does
suffer
a
little
from
absence
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
pulls
during
the
of
mind
he
is
all
for
compromise
do
you
know
the
kind
of
man
who
when
you
talk
to
him
about
the
five
best
breeds
of
dog
always
ends
up
by
buying
a
mongrel
the
duke
is
the
kindest
of
men
and
always
trying
to
please
everybody
he
generally
finishes
by
pleasing
nobody
smith
yes
i
think
i
know
the
sort
of
thing
doctor
take
this
conjuring
for
instance
you
know
the
duke
has
two
wards
who
are
to
live
with
him
now
smith
yes
i
heard
something
about
a
nephew
and
niece
from
ireland
doctor
the
niece
came
from
ireland
some
months
ago
but
the
nephew
comes
back
from
america
gets
up
abruptly
and
walks
about
the
i
think
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
in
spite
of
your
precious
you
seem
to
me
to
be
a
sane
man
and
i
fancy
i
shall
want
all
the
sane
men
i
can
get
smith
i
am
at
your
service
do
you
know
i
rather
guessed
you
did
not
come
here
only
to
protest
against
my
precious
doctor
about
in
subdued
well
you
guessed
right
i
was
family
physician
to
the
duke
brother
in
ireland
i
knew
the
family
pretty
well
smith
i
suppose
you
mean
you
knew
something
odd
about
the
family
doctor
well
they
saw
fairies
and
things
of
that
sort
smith
and
i
suppose
to
the
medical
mind
seeing
fairies
means
much
the
same
as
seeing
snakes
doctor
a
sour
well
they
saw
them
in
ireland
i
suppose
it
quite
correct
to
see
fairies
in
ireland
it
like
gambling
at
monte
carlo
it
quite
respectable
but
i
do
draw
the
line
at
their
seeing
fairies
in
england
i
do
object
to
their
bringing
their
ghosts
and
goblins
and
witches
into
the
poor
duke
own
back
garden
and
within
a
yard
of
my
own
red
lamp
it
shows
a
lack
of
tact
smith
but
i
do
understand
that
the
duke
nephew
and
niece
see
witches
and
fairies
between
here
and
your
lamp
walks
to
the
garden
window
and
looks
doctor
well
the
nephew
has
been
in
america
it
stands
to
reason
you
ca
see
fairies
in
america
but
there
is
this
sort
of
superstition
in
the
family
and
i
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
the
girl
smith
why
what
does
she
do
doctor
oh
she
wanders
about
the
park
and
the
woods
in
the
evenings
damp
evenings
for
choice
she
calls
it
the
celtic
twilight
i
no
use
for
the
celtic
twilight
myself
it
has
a
tendency
to
get
on
the
chest
but
what
is
worse
she
is
always
talking
about
meeting
somebody
some
elf
or
wizard
or
something
i
do
like
it
at
all
smith
have
you
told
the
duke
doctor
a
grim
oh
yes
i
told
the
duke
the
result
was
the
conjurer
smith
the
doctor
down
his
cigar
in
the
the
duke
is
indescribable
he
will
be
here
presently
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
put
two
or
three
facts
or
ideas
before
him
and
the
thing
he
makes
out
of
them
is
always
something
that
seems
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
tell
any
other
human
being
about
a
girl
dreaming
of
the
fairies
and
her
practical
brother
from
america
and
he
would
settle
it
in
some
obvious
way
and
satisfy
some
one
send
her
to
america
or
let
her
have
her
fairies
in
ireland
now
the
duke
thinks
a
conjurer
would
just
meet
the
case
i
suppose
he
vaguely
thinks
it
would
brighten
things
up
and
somehow
satisfy
the
believers
interest
in
supernatural
things
and
the
unbelievers
interest
in
smart
things
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
unbeliever
thinks
the
conjurer
a
fraud
and
the
believer
thinks
he
a
fraud
too
the
conjurer
satisfies
nobody
that
is
why
he
satisfies
the
duke
duke
hastings
papers
duke
a
healthy
hearty
man
in
tweeds
with
a
rather
wandering
eye
in
the
present
state
of
the
peerage
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
duke
an
ass
is
a
duke
smith
so
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
but
we
rather
in
a
rush
hastings
has
gone
over
to
a
table
with
the
you
know
carleon
is
coming
this
afternoon
hastings
yes
your
grace
his
train
will
be
in
by
now
i
have
sent
the
trap
duke
thank
you
to
the
other
my
nephew
grimthorpe
morris
you
know
miss
carleon
brother
from
america
i
hear
he
been
doing
great
things
out
there
petrol
or
something
must
move
with
the
times
eh
doctor
i
afraid
smith
does
always
agree
with
moving
with
the
times
duke
oh
come
come
progress
you
know
progress
of
course
i
know
how
busy
you
are
you
must
overwork
yourself
you
know
hastings
was
telling
me
you
laughed
over
those
subscriptions
of
mine
well
well
i
believe
in
looking
at
both
sides
of
a
question
you
know
aspects
as
old
buffle
called
them
aspects
an
gesture
of
the
you
represent
the
tendency
to
drink
in
moderation
and
you
do
good
in
way
the
doctor
represents
the
tendency
not
to
drink
at
all
and
he
does
good
in
way
we
ca
be
ancient
britons
you
know
prolonged
and
puzzled
silence
such
as
always
follows
the
more
abrupt
of
duke
or
disassociations
of
smith
last
ancient
britons
doctor
smith
a
low
do
bother
it
only
his
duke
unabated
i
saw
the
place
you
putting
up
for
it
smith
very
good
work
very
good
work
indeed
art
for
the
people
eh
i
particularly
liked
that
woodwork
over
the
west
door
glad
to
see
you
using
the
new
sort
of
graining
why
it
all
reminds
one
of
the
french
revolution
silence
as
duke
alertly
about
the
smith
to
doctor
an
smith
does
it
remind
you
of
the
french
revolution
doctor
as
much
as
of
anything
else
his
grace
never
reminds
me
of
anything
young
and
very
high
american
voice
is
heard
calling
in
the
garden
say
could
somebody
see
to
one
of
these
trunks
hastings
out
into
the
garden
he
returns
morris
carleon
very
young
man
hardly
more
than
a
boy
but
with
very
american
dress
and
manners
he
is
dark
smallish
and
active
and
the
racial
type
under
his
americanism
is
morris
as
he
puts
in
his
head
at
the
see
here
does
a
duke
live
here
doctor
is
nearest
to
him
with
great
yes
only
one
morris
i
reckon
he
the
one
i
want
anyhow
i
his
nephew
duke
is
ruminating
in
the
foreground
with
one
eye
rather
off
turns
at
the
voice
and
morris
by
the
duke
delighted
to
see
you
my
dear
boy
i
hear
you
been
doing
very
well
for
yourself
morris
well
pretty
well
duke
and
better
still
for
paul
vandam
i
guess
i
manage
the
old
man
mines
out
in
arizona
you
know
duke
his
head
ah
very
man
very
methods
i
told
well
i
dare
say
he
does
a
great
deal
of
good
with
his
money
and
we
ca
go
back
to
the
spanish
inquisition
during
which
the
three
men
look
at
each
morris
and
how
patricia
duke
little
oh
she
very
well
i
think
she
hesitates
morris
well
then
where
patricia
is
a
slightly
embarrassed
pause
and
doctor
doctor
miss
carleon
is
walking
about
the
grounds
i
think
morris
to
the
garden
doors
and
looks
morris
it
a
mighty
chilly
night
to
choose
does
my
sister
commonly
select
such
evenings
to
take
the
air
and
the
damp
doctor
a
if
i
may
say
so
i
quite
agree
with
you
i
have
often
taken
the
liberty
of
warning
your
sister
against
going
out
in
all
weathers
like
this
duke
waving
his
hands
the
artist
temperament
what
i
always
call
the
artistic
temperament
wordsworth
you
know
and
all
that
morris
all
what
duke
to
lecture
with
why
temperament
you
know
it
her
temperament
to
see
the
fairies
it
my
temperament
not
to
see
the
fairies
why
i
walked
all
round
the
grounds
twenty
times
and
never
saw
a
fairy
well
it
like
that
about
this
wizard
or
whatever
she
calls
it
for
her
there
is
somebody
there
for
us
there
would
not
be
somebody
there
do
you
see
morris
somebody
there
what
do
you
mean
duke
well
you
ca
quite
call
it
a
man
morris
a
man
duke
well
as
old
buffle
used
to
say
what
is
a
man
morris
a
strong
rise
of
the
american
with
your
permission
duke
i
eliminate
old
buffle
do
you
mean
that
anybody
has
had
the
tarnation
coolness
to
suggest
that
some
man
duke
oh
not
a
you
know
a
magician
something
mythical
you
know
smith
not
a
but
a
medicine
man
doctor
i
am
a
medicine
man
morris
and
you
do
look
mythical
doc
bites
his
finger
and
begins
to
pace
restlessly
up
and
down
the
duke
well
you
know
the
artistic
temperament
morris
see
here
duke
in
most
commercial
ways
we
a
pretty
forward
country
in
these
moral
ways
we
content
to
be
a
pretty
backward
country
and
if
you
ask
me
whether
i
like
my
sister
walking
about
the
woods
on
a
night
like
this
well
i
do
duke
i
am
afraid
you
americans
are
so
advanced
as
i
hoped
why
as
old
buffle
used
to
say
he
speaks
a
distant
voice
is
heard
singing
in
the
garden
it
comes
nearer
and
nearer
smith
suddenly
to
doctor
smith
whose
voice
is
that
doctor
it
is
no
business
of
mine
to
decide
morris
to
the
you
need
not
trouble
i
know
who
it
is
patricia
carleon
patricia
where
have
you
been
patricia
oh
in
fairyland
doctor
and
whereabouts
is
that
patricia
it
rather
different
from
other
places
it
either
nowhere
or
it
wherever
you
are
morris
has
it
any
inhabitants
patricia
generally
only
two
oneself
and
one
shadow
but
whether
he
is
my
shadow
or
i
am
his
shadow
is
never
found
out
morris
he
who
patricia
to
understand
his
annoyance
for
the
first
time
and
oh
you
need
get
conventional
about
it
morris
he
is
not
a
mortal
morris
what
his
name
patricia
we
have
no
names
there
you
never
really
know
anybody
if
you
know
his
name
morris
what
does
he
look
like
patricia
i
have
only
met
him
in
the
twilight
he
seems
robed
in
a
long
cloak
with
a
peaked
cap
or
hood
like
the
elves
in
my
nursery
stories
sometimes
when
i
look
out
of
the
window
here
i
see
him
passing
round
this
house
like
a
shadow
and
see
his
pointed
hood
dark
against
the
sunset
or
the
rising
of
the
moon
smith
what
does
he
talk
about
patricia
he
tells
me
the
truth
very
many
true
things
he
is
a
wizard
morris
how
do
you
know
he
a
wizard
i
suppose
he
plays
some
tricks
on
you
patricia
i
should
know
he
was
a
wizard
if
he
played
no
tricks
but
once
he
stooped
and
picked
up
a
stone
and
cast
it
into
the
air
and
it
flew
up
into
god
heaven
like
a
bird
morris
was
that
what
first
made
you
think
he
was
a
wizard
patricia
oh
no
when
i
first
saw
him
he
was
tracing
circles
and
pentacles
in
the
grass
and
talking
the
language
of
the
elves
morris
do
you
know
the
language
of
the
elves
patricia
not
until
i
heard
it
morris
his
voice
as
if
for
his
sister
but
losing
patience
so
completely
that
he
talks
much
louder
than
he
see
here
patricia
i
reckon
this
kind
of
thing
is
going
to
be
the
limit
i
just
not
going
to
have
you
let
in
by
some
blamed
tramp
or
because
you
choose
to
read
minor
poetry
about
the
fairies
if
this
gipsy
or
whatever
he
is
troubles
you
again
doctor
his
hand
morris
come
you
must
allow
a
little
more
for
poetry
we
ca
all
feed
on
nothing
but
petrol
duke
quite
right
quite
right
and
being
irish
do
you
know
celtic
as
old
buffle
used
to
say
charming
songs
you
know
about
the
irish
girl
who
has
a
plaid
shawl
and
a
banshee
poor
old
gladstone
as
smith
doctor
i
thought
you
yourself
considered
the
family
superstition
bad
for
the
health
doctor
i
consider
a
family
superstition
is
better
for
the
health
than
a
family
quarrel
walks
casually
across
patricia
well
it
must
be
nice
to
be
young
and
still
see
all
those
stars
and
sunsets
we
old
buffers
wo
be
too
strict
with
you
if
your
view
of
things
sometimes
gets
a
bit
mixed
up
shall
we
say
if
the
stars
get
loose
about
the
grass
by
mistake
or
if
once
or
twice
the
sunset
gets
into
the
east
we
should
only
say
dream
as
much
as
you
like
dream
for
all
mankind
dream
for
us
who
can
dream
no
longer
but
do
not
quite
forget
the
difference
patricia
what
difference
doctor
the
difference
between
the
things
that
are
beautiful
and
the
things
that
are
there
that
red
lamp
over
my
door
is
beautiful
but
it
there
you
might
even
come
to
be
glad
it
is
there
when
the
stars
of
gold
and
silver
have
faded
i
am
an
old
man
now
but
some
men
are
still
glad
to
find
my
red
star
i
do
not
say
they
are
the
wise
men
patricia
yes
i
know
you
are
good
to
everybody
but
do
you
think
there
may
be
floating
and
spiritual
stars
which
will
last
longer
than
the
red
lamps
smith
yes
but
they
are
fixed
stars
doctor
the
red
lamp
will
last
my
time
duke
capital
capital
why
it
like
tennyson
i
remember
when
i
was
an
undergrad
red
light
disappears
no
one
sees
it
at
first
patricia
points
morris
what
the
matter
patricia
the
red
star
is
gone
morris
nonsense
to
the
garden
it
only
somebody
standing
in
front
of
it
say
duke
there
somebody
standing
in
the
garden
patricia
i
told
you
he
walked
about
the
garden
morris
if
it
that
of
yours
into
the
garden
followed
by
doctor
duke
somebody
in
the
garden
really
this
land
campaign
morris
rather
morris
a
spry
fellow
your
friend
he
slipped
through
my
hands
like
a
shadow
patricia
i
told
you
he
was
a
shadow
morris
well
i
guess
there
going
to
be
a
shadow
hunt
got
a
lantern
duke
patricia
oh
you
need
not
trouble
he
will
come
if
i
call
him
goes
out
into
the
garden
and
calls
out
some
and
unintelligible
words
somewhat
like
the
song
preceding
her
entrance
the
red
light
reappears
and
there
is
a
slight
sound
as
of
fallen
leaves
shuffled
by
approaching
feet
the
stranger
the
pointed
hood
is
seen
standing
outside
the
garden
patricia
you
may
enter
all
doors
figure
comes
into
the
morris
the
garden
doors
behind
now
see
here
wizard
we
got
you
and
we
know
you
a
fraud
smith
pardon
me
i
do
not
fancy
that
we
know
that
for
myself
i
must
confess
to
something
of
the
doctor
agnosticism
morris
and
turning
almost
with
a
i
did
know
you
parsons
stuck
up
for
any
fables
but
your
own
smith
i
stick
up
for
the
thing
every
man
has
a
right
to
perhaps
the
only
thing
that
every
man
has
a
right
to
morris
and
what
is
that
smith
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
even
your
master
the
petroleum
millionaire
has
a
right
to
that
and
i
think
he
needs
it
more
morris
i
do
think
there
much
doubt
about
the
question
minister
i
met
this
sort
of
fellow
often
enough
the
sort
of
fellow
who
wheedles
money
out
of
girls
by
telling
them
he
can
make
stones
disappear
doctor
stranger
do
you
say
you
can
make
stones
disappear
stranger
yes
i
can
make
stones
disappear
morris
i
reckon
you
the
kind
of
tough
who
knows
how
to
make
a
watch
and
chain
disappear
stranger
yes
i
know
how
to
make
a
watch
and
chain
disappear
morris
and
i
should
think
you
were
pretty
good
at
disappearing
yourself
stranger
i
have
done
such
a
thing
morris
a
will
you
disappear
now
stranger
no
i
think
i
appear
instead
throws
back
his
hood
showing
the
head
of
an
man
young
but
rather
worn
then
he
unfastens
his
cloak
and
throws
it
off
emerging
in
complete
modern
evening
dress
he
advances
down
the
room
towards
duke
out
his
watch
as
he
does
your
grace
i
afraid
i
rather
too
early
for
the
performance
but
this
gentleman
a
gesture
morris
seemed
rather
impatient
for
it
to
begin
duke
at
a
oh
why
really
are
you
the
stranger
yes
i
am
the
conjurer
is
general
laughter
except
patricia
the
others
mingle
in
talk
stranger
up
to
stranger
i
am
very
sorry
i
am
not
a
wizard
patricia
i
wish
you
were
a
thief
instead
stranger
have
i
committed
a
worse
crime
than
thieving
patricia
you
have
committed
the
cruellest
crime
i
think
that
there
is
stranger
and
what
is
the
cruellest
crime
patricia
stealing
a
child
toy
stranger
and
what
have
i
stolen
patricia
a
fairy
tale
curtain
act
ii
same
room
lighted
more
brilliantly
an
hour
later
in
the
evening
on
one
side
a
table
covered
with
packs
of
cards
pyramids
at
which
conjurer
evening
dress
is
standing
quietly
setting
out
his
tricks
a
little
more
in
the
foreground
duke
hastings
a
number
of
hastings
there
are
only
a
few
small
matters
here
are
the
programmes
of
the
entertainment
your
grace
wanted
carleon
wishes
to
see
them
very
much
duke
thanks
thanks
the
hastings
shall
i
carry
them
for
your
grace
duke
no
no
i
sha
forget
i
sha
forget
why
you
no
idea
how
businesslike
i
am
we
have
to
be
you
know
i
know
you
a
bit
of
a
socialist
but
i
assure
you
there
a
good
deal
to
do
stake
in
the
country
and
all
that
look
at
remembering
faces
now
the
king
never
forgets
faces
the
programmes
i
never
forget
faces
sight
of
conjurer
genially
draws
him
into
the
why
the
professor
here
who
performs
before
the
king
down
the
you
see
it
on
the
caravans
you
know
performs
before
the
king
almost
every
night
i
suppose
conjurer
i
sometimes
let
his
majesty
have
an
evening
off
and
turn
my
attention
of
course
to
the
very
highest
nobility
but
naturally
i
have
performed
before
every
sovereign
potentate
white
and
black
there
never
was
a
conjurer
who
had
duke
that
right
that
right
and
you
say
with
me
that
the
great
business
for
a
king
is
remembering
people
conjurer
i
should
say
it
was
remembering
which
people
to
remember
duke
well
well
now
round
rather
wildly
for
being
really
businesslike
hastings
shall
i
take
the
programmes
for
your
grace
duke
them
no
no
i
sha
forget
is
there
anything
else
hastings
i
have
to
go
down
the
village
about
the
wire
to
stratford
the
only
other
thing
at
all
urgent
is
the
militant
vegetarians
duke
ah
the
militant
vegetarians
you
heard
of
them
i
sure
wo
obey
the
law
conjurer
so
long
as
the
government
serves
out
meat
conjurer
let
them
be
comforted
there
are
a
good
many
people
who
get
much
meat
duke
well
well
i
bound
to
say
they
very
enthusiastic
advanced
too
oh
certainly
advanced
like
joan
of
arc
silence
in
which
conjurer
at
conjurer
joan
of
arc
a
vegetarian
duke
oh
well
it
a
very
high
ideal
after
all
the
sacredness
of
life
you
know
the
sacredness
of
life
his
but
they
carry
it
too
far
they
killed
a
policeman
down
in
kent
conjurer
killed
a
policeman
how
vegetarian
well
i
suppose
it
was
so
long
as
they
did
eat
him
hastings
they
are
asking
only
for
small
subscriptions
indeed
they
prefer
to
collect
a
large
number
of
to
prove
the
popularity
of
their
movement
but
i
should
advise
duke
oh
give
them
three
shillings
then
hastings
if
i
might
suggest
duke
hang
it
all
we
gave
the
three
shillings
it
seems
only
fair
hastings
if
i
might
suggest
anything
i
think
your
grace
will
be
wise
not
to
subscribe
in
this
case
the
have
already
used
their
funds
to
form
gangs
ostensibly
to
protect
their
own
meetings
and
if
the
vegetarians
use
theirs
to
break
up
the
meetings
well
it
will
look
rather
funny
that
we
have
paid
roughs
on
both
sides
it
will
be
rather
difficult
to
explain
when
it
comes
before
the
magistrate
duke
but
i
shall
be
the
magistrate
conjurer
at
him
that
the
system
my
dear
hastings
that
the
advantage
of
the
system
not
a
logical
system
no
rousseau
in
it
but
see
how
well
it
works
i
shall
be
the
very
best
magistrate
that
could
be
on
the
bench
the
others
would
be
biassed
you
know
old
sir
lawrence
is
a
vegetarian
himself
and
might
be
hard
on
the
roughs
colonel
crashaw
would
be
sure
to
be
hard
on
the
vegetarian
roughs
but
if
i
paid
both
of
of
course
i
sha
be
hard
on
either
of
and
there
you
have
it
just
perfect
impartiality
hastings
shall
i
take
the
programmes
your
grace
duke
no
no
i
wo
forget
hastings
well
professor
what
the
news
in
the
conjuring
world
conjurer
i
fear
there
is
never
any
news
in
the
conjuring
world
duke
do
you
have
a
newspaper
or
something
everybody
has
a
newspaper
now
you
know
the
er
daily
or
that
sort
of
thing
conjurer
no
i
have
been
a
journalist
myself
but
i
think
journalism
and
conjuring
will
always
be
incompatible
duke
incompatible
oh
but
that
where
i
differ
that
where
i
take
larger
views
larger
laws
as
old
buffle
said
nothing
you
know
except
husband
and
wife
and
so
on
you
must
talk
to
morris
about
that
it
wonderful
the
way
incompatibility
has
gone
forward
in
the
states
conjurer
i
only
mean
that
the
two
trades
rest
on
opposite
principles
the
whole
point
of
being
a
conjurer
is
that
you
wo
explain
a
thing
that
has
happened
duke
well
and
the
journalist
conjurer
well
the
whole
point
of
being
a
journalist
is
that
you
do
explain
a
thing
that
has
happened
duke
but
you
want
somewhere
to
discuss
the
new
tricks
conjurer
there
are
no
new
tricks
and
if
there
were
we
should
want
discussed
duke
i
afraid
you
not
advanced
are
you
interested
in
modern
progress
conjurer
yes
we
are
interested
in
all
tricks
done
by
illusion
duke
well
well
i
must
go
and
see
how
morris
is
pleasure
of
seeing
you
later
duke
the
conjurer
why
are
nice
men
such
asses
to
arrange
the
that
seems
all
right
the
pack
of
cards
that
is
a
pack
of
cards
and
the
pack
of
cards
that
is
a
pack
of
cards
the
hat
that
looks
like
a
gentleman
hat
but
which
in
reality
is
no
gentleman
hat
only
my
hat
and
i
am
not
a
gentleman
i
am
only
a
conjurer
and
this
is
only
a
conjurer
hat
i
could
not
take
off
this
hat
to
a
lady
i
can
take
rabbits
out
of
it
goldfish
out
of
it
snakes
out
of
it
only
i
take
my
own
head
out
of
it
i
suppose
i
a
lower
animal
than
a
rabbit
or
a
snake
anyhow
they
can
get
out
of
the
conjurer
hat
and
i
ca
i
am
a
conjurer
and
nothing
else
but
a
conjurer
unless
i
could
show
i
was
something
else
and
that
would
be
worse
begins
to
dash
the
cards
rather
irregularly
about
the
table
patricia
patricia
i
beg
your
pardon
i
came
to
get
some
programmes
my
uncle
wants
them
walks
swiftly
across
and
takes
up
the
conjurer
dashing
cards
about
the
miss
carleon
might
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
puts
his
hands
in
his
pockets
stares
at
the
table
and
his
face
assumes
a
sardonic
the
question
is
purely
practical
patricia
at
the
i
can
hardly
imagine
what
the
question
can
be
conjurer
i
am
the
question
patricia
and
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
conjurer
you
have
everything
to
do
with
it
i
am
the
question
you
patricia
well
what
am
i
conjurer
you
are
the
answer
patricia
the
answer
to
what
conjurer
round
to
the
front
of
the
table
and
sitting
against
the
answer
to
me
you
think
i
a
liar
because
i
walked
about
the
fields
with
you
and
said
i
could
make
stones
disappear
well
so
i
can
i
a
conjurer
in
mere
point
of
fact
it
was
a
lie
but
if
it
had
been
a
lie
i
should
have
told
it
just
the
same
i
would
have
told
twenty
such
lies
you
may
or
may
not
know
why
patricia
i
know
nothing
about
such
lies
puts
her
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
but
conjurer
is
sitting
on
the
table
and
staring
at
his
boots
does
not
notice
the
action
and
goes
on
as
in
a
sincere
conjurer
i
do
know
whether
you
have
any
notion
of
what
it
means
to
a
man
like
me
to
talk
to
a
lady
like
you
even
on
false
pretences
i
am
an
adventurer
i
am
a
blackguard
if
one
can
earn
the
title
by
being
in
all
the
blackguard
societies
of
the
world
i
have
thought
everything
out
by
myself
when
i
was
a
guttersnipe
in
fleet
street
or
lower
still
a
journalist
in
fleet
street
before
i
met
you
i
never
guessed
that
rich
people
ever
thought
at
all
well
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
we
had
some
good
conversations
did
we
i
am
a
liar
but
i
told
you
a
great
deal
of
the
truth
turns
and
resumes
the
arrangement
of
the
patricia
yes
you
did
tell
me
a
great
deal
of
the
truth
you
told
me
hundreds
and
thousands
of
truths
but
you
never
told
me
the
truth
that
one
wants
to
know
conjurer
and
what
is
that
patricia
back
into
the
you
never
told
me
the
truth
about
yourself
you
never
told
me
you
were
only
the
conjurer
conjurer
i
did
not
tell
you
that
because
i
do
not
even
know
it
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
only
the
conjurer
patricia
what
do
you
mean
conjurer
sometimes
i
am
afraid
i
am
something
worse
than
the
conjurer
patricia
i
can
not
think
of
anything
worse
than
a
conjurer
who
does
not
call
himself
a
conjurer
conjurer
there
is
something
worse
but
that
is
not
what
i
want
to
say
do
you
really
find
that
very
unpardonable
come
let
me
put
you
a
case
never
mind
about
whether
it
is
our
case
a
man
spends
his
time
incessantly
in
going
about
in
carriages
to
lodgings
he
has
to
make
up
new
tricks
new
patter
new
nonsense
sometimes
every
night
of
his
life
mostly
he
has
to
do
it
in
the
beastly
black
cities
of
the
midlands
and
the
north
where
he
ca
get
out
into
the
country
now
and
again
he
does
it
at
some
gentleman
where
he
can
get
out
into
the
country
well
you
know
that
actors
and
orators
and
all
sorts
of
people
like
to
rehearse
their
effects
in
the
open
air
if
they
can
you
know
that
story
of
the
great
statesman
who
was
heard
by
his
own
gardener
saying
as
he
paced
the
garden
had
i
speaker
received
the
smallest
intimation
that
i
could
be
called
upon
to
speak
this
evening
patricia
a
smile
and
he
goes
on
with
overwhelming
well
conjurers
are
just
the
same
it
takes
some
time
to
prepare
an
impromptu
a
man
like
that
walks
about
the
woods
and
fields
doing
all
his
tricks
beforehand
and
talking
all
sorts
of
gibberish
because
he
thinks
he
is
alone
one
evening
this
man
found
he
was
not
alone
he
found
a
very
beautiful
child
was
watching
him
patricia
a
child
conjurer
yes
that
was
his
first
impression
he
is
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
i
have
known
him
all
my
life
he
tells
me
he
has
since
discovered
she
is
not
a
child
she
does
not
fulfil
the
definition
patricia
what
is
the
definition
of
a
child
conjurer
somebody
you
can
play
with
patricia
why
did
you
wear
that
cloak
with
the
hood
up
conjurer
i
think
it
escaped
your
notice
that
it
was
raining
patricia
and
what
did
this
friend
of
yours
do
conjurer
you
have
already
told
me
what
he
did
he
destroyed
a
fairy
tale
for
he
created
a
fairy
tale
that
he
was
bound
to
destroy
round
suddenly
on
the
but
do
you
blame
a
man
very
much
miss
carleon
if
he
enjoyed
the
only
fairy
tale
he
had
had
in
his
life
suppose
he
said
the
silly
circles
he
was
drawing
for
practice
were
really
magic
circles
suppose
he
said
the
bosh
he
was
talking
was
the
language
of
the
elves
remember
he
has
read
fairy
tales
as
much
as
you
have
fairy
tales
are
the
only
democratic
institutions
all
the
classes
have
heard
all
the
fairy
tales
do
you
blame
him
very
much
if
he
too
tried
to
have
a
holiday
in
fairyland
patricia
i
blame
him
less
than
i
did
but
i
still
say
there
can
be
nothing
worse
than
false
magic
and
after
all
it
was
he
who
brought
the
false
magic
conjurer
from
his
yes
it
was
she
who
brought
the
real
magic
morris
he
walks
straight
up
to
the
and
picks
up
one
article
after
another
putting
each
down
with
a
morris
i
know
that
one
i
know
that
i
know
that
let
see
that
the
false
bottom
i
think
that
works
with
a
wire
i
know
that
it
goes
up
the
sleeve
that
the
false
bottom
again
that
the
substituted
pack
of
cards
that
patricia
really
morris
you
must
talk
as
if
you
knew
everything
conjurer
oh
i
do
mind
anyone
knowing
everything
miss
carleon
there
is
something
that
is
much
more
important
than
knowing
how
a
thing
is
done
morris
and
what
that
conjurer
knowing
how
to
do
it
morris
nasal
again
in
that
so
eh
being
the
conjurer
because
you
ca
any
longer
take
all
the
sidewalk
as
a
fairy
patricia
the
room
and
speaking
seriously
to
her
really
morris
you
are
very
rude
and
it
quite
ridiculous
to
be
rude
this
gentleman
was
only
practising
some
tricks
by
himself
in
the
garden
a
certain
if
there
was
any
mistake
it
was
mine
come
shake
hands
or
whatever
men
do
when
they
apologize
do
be
silly
he
wo
turn
you
into
a
bowl
of
goldfish
morris
well
i
guess
that
so
his
shake
shake
and
you
wo
turn
me
into
a
bowl
of
goldfish
anyhow
professor
i
understand
that
when
you
do
produce
a
bowl
of
goldfish
they
are
generally
slips
of
carrot
that
is
so
professor
conjurer
yes
a
bowl
of
goldfish
from
his
tail
pockets
and
holds
it
under
the
other
judge
for
yourself
morris
monstrous
very
good
very
good
but
i
know
how
that
done
i
know
how
that
done
you
have
an
cap
you
know
or
cover
conjurer
yes
back
gloomily
to
his
table
and
sits
on
it
picking
up
a
pack
of
cards
and
balancing
it
in
his
morris
ah
most
mysteries
are
tolerably
plain
if
you
know
the
apparatus
doctor
smith
with
grave
faces
but
growing
silent
as
they
reach
the
i
guess
i
wish
we
had
all
the
old
apparatus
of
all
the
old
priests
and
prophets
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
i
guess
most
of
the
old
miracles
and
that
were
a
matter
of
just
panel
and
wires
conjurer
i
do
quite
understand
you
what
old
apparatus
do
you
want
so
much
morris
out
with
all
the
frenzy
of
the
young
well
sir
i
just
want
that
old
apparatus
that
turned
rods
into
snakes
i
want
those
smart
appliances
sir
that
brought
water
out
of
a
rock
when
old
man
moses
chose
to
hit
it
i
guess
it
a
pity
we
lost
the
machinery
i
would
like
to
have
those
old
conjurers
here
that
called
themselves
patriarchs
and
prophets
in
your
precious
bible
patricia
morris
you
must
talk
like
that
morris
well
i
do
believe
in
religion
doctor
hush
hush
nobody
but
women
believe
in
religion
patricia
i
think
this
is
a
fitting
opportunity
to
show
you
another
ancient
conjuring
trick
doctor
which
one
is
that
patricia
the
vanishing
lady
patricia
smith
there
is
one
part
of
their
old
apparatus
i
regret
especially
being
lost
morris
yes
smith
the
apparatus
for
writing
the
book
of
job
morris
well
well
they
did
know
everything
in
those
old
times
smith
no
and
in
those
old
times
they
knew
they
did
where
shall
wisdom
be
found
and
what
is
the
place
of
understanding
conjurer
somewhere
in
america
i
believe
smith
man
knoweth
not
the
price
thereof
neither
is
it
found
in
the
land
of
the
living
the
deep
sayeth
it
is
not
in
me
the
sea
sayeth
it
is
not
with
me
death
and
destruction
say
we
have
heard
tell
of
it
god
understandeth
the
way
thereof
and
he
knoweth
the
place
thereof
for
he
looketh
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
seeth
under
the
whole
heaven
but
to
man
he
hath
said
behold
the
fear
of
the
lord
that
is
wisdom
and
to
depart
from
evil
is
understanding
suddenly
to
doctor
how
that
for
agnosticism
grimthorpe
what
a
pity
that
apparatus
is
lost
morris
well
you
may
just
smile
how
you
choose
i
reckon
but
i
say
the
conjurer
here
could
be
the
biggest
man
in
the
big
blessed
centuries
if
he
could
just
show
us
how
the
holy
old
tricks
were
done
we
must
say
this
for
old
man
moses
that
he
was
in
advance
of
his
time
when
he
did
the
old
tricks
they
were
new
tricks
he
got
the
pull
on
the
public
he
could
do
his
tricks
before
grown
men
great
bearded
fighting
men
who
could
win
battles
and
sing
psalms
but
this
modern
conjuring
is
all
behind
the
times
that
why
they
only
do
it
with
schoolboys
there
is
a
trick
on
that
table
i
do
know
the
whole
trade
as
dead
as
mutton
and
not
half
so
satisfying
why
he
to
conjurer
brought
out
a
bowl
of
goldfish
just
now
an
old
trick
that
anybody
could
do
conjurer
oh
i
quite
agree
the
apparatus
is
perfectly
simple
by
the
way
let
me
have
a
look
at
those
goldfish
of
yours
will
you
morris
i
not
a
paid
come
here
to
conjure
not
here
to
do
stale
tricks
i
here
to
see
through
i
say
it
an
old
trick
and
conjurer
true
but
as
you
said
we
never
show
it
except
to
schoolboys
morris
and
may
i
ask
you
professor
hocus
pocus
or
whatever
your
name
is
whom
you
are
calling
a
schoolboy
conjurer
i
beg
your
pardon
your
sister
will
tell
you
i
am
sometimes
mistaken
about
children
morris
i
forbid
you
to
appeal
to
my
sister
conjurer
that
is
exactly
what
a
schoolboy
would
do
morris
abrupt
and
dangerous
i
am
not
a
schoolboy
professor
i
am
a
quiet
business
man
but
i
tell
you
in
the
country
i
come
from
the
hand
of
a
quiet
business
man
goes
to
his
hip
pocket
at
an
insult
like
that
conjurer
let
it
go
to
his
pocket
i
thought
the
hand
of
a
quiet
business
man
more
often
went
to
someone
else
pocket
morris
you
his
hand
to
his
hip
doctor
his
hand
on
his
doctor
gentlemen
i
think
you
are
both
forgetting
yourselves
conjurer
perhaps
tone
sinks
suddenly
to
i
ask
pardon
for
what
i
said
it
was
certainly
in
excess
of
the
young
gentleman
deserts
i
sometimes
rather
wish
i
could
forget
myself
morris
after
a
well
the
entertainment
coming
on
and
you
english
do
like
a
scene
i
reckon
i
have
to
bury
the
blamed
old
hatchet
too
doctor
a
certain
dignity
his
social
type
shining
through
his
carleon
you
will
forgive
an
old
man
who
knew
your
father
well
if
he
doubts
whether
you
are
doing
yourself
justice
in
treating
yourself
as
an
american
indian
merely
because
you
have
lived
in
america
in
my
old
friend
huxley
time
we
of
the
middle
classes
disbelieved
in
reason
and
all
sorts
of
things
but
we
did
believe
in
good
manners
it
is
a
pity
if
the
aristocracy
ca
i
do
like
to
hear
you
say
you
are
a
savage
and
have
buried
a
tomahawk
i
would
rather
hear
you
say
as
your
irish
ancestors
would
have
said
that
you
have
sheathed
your
sword
with
the
dignity
proper
to
a
gentleman
morris
very
well
i
sheathed
my
sword
with
the
dignity
proper
to
a
gentleman
conjurer
and
i
have
sheathed
my
sword
with
the
dignity
proper
to
a
conjurer
morris
how
does
the
conjurer
sheath
a
sword
conjurer
swallows
it
doctor
then
we
all
agree
there
shall
be
no
quarrel
smith
may
i
say
a
word
i
have
a
great
dislike
of
a
quarrel
for
a
reason
quite
beyond
my
duty
to
my
cloth
morris
and
what
is
that
smith
i
object
to
a
quarrel
because
it
always
interrupts
an
argument
may
i
bring
you
back
for
a
moment
to
the
argument
you
were
saying
that
these
modern
conjuring
tricks
are
simply
the
old
miracles
when
they
have
once
been
found
out
but
surely
another
view
is
possible
when
we
speak
of
things
being
sham
we
generally
mean
that
they
are
imitations
of
things
that
are
genuine
take
that
reynolds
over
there
of
the
to
a
picture
on
the
if
i
were
to
say
it
was
a
copy
morris
wal
the
duke
real
amiable
but
i
reckon
you
find
what
you
call
the
interruption
of
an
argument
smith
well
suppose
i
did
say
so
you
would
take
it
as
meaning
that
sir
joshua
reynolds
never
lived
why
should
sham
miracles
prove
to
us
that
real
saints
and
prophets
never
lived
there
may
be
sham
magic
and
real
magic
also
conjurer
his
head
and
listens
with
a
strange
air
of
smith
there
may
be
turnip
ghosts
precisely
because
there
are
real
ghosts
there
may
be
theatrical
fairies
precisely
because
there
are
real
fairies
you
do
not
abolish
the
bank
of
england
by
pointing
to
a
forged
morris
i
hope
the
professor
enjoys
being
called
a
forged
conjurer
almost
as
much
as
being
called
the
prospectus
of
some
american
companies
doctor
gentlemen
gentlemen
conjurer
i
am
sorry
morris
wal
let
have
the
argument
first
then
i
guess
we
can
have
the
quarrel
afterwards
i
clean
this
house
of
some
encumbrances
see
here
smith
i
not
putting
anything
on
your
real
miracle
notion
i
say
and
science
says
that
there
a
cause
for
everything
science
will
find
out
that
cause
and
sooner
or
later
your
old
miracle
will
look
mighty
mean
sooner
or
later
science
will
botanise
a
bit
on
your
turnip
ghosts
and
make
you
look
turnips
yourselves
for
having
taken
any
i
say
doctor
a
low
voice
smith
i
do
like
this
peaceful
argument
of
yours
the
boy
is
getting
much
too
excited
morris
you
say
old
man
reynolds
lived
and
science
do
say
no
turns
excitedly
to
the
but
i
guess
he
dead
now
and
no
more
raise
your
saints
and
prophets
from
the
dead
than
you
raise
the
duke
to
dance
on
that
wall
picture
begins
to
sway
slightly
to
and
fro
on
the
doctor
why
the
picture
is
moving
morris
furiously
on
conjurer
you
were
in
the
room
before
us
do
you
reckon
that
will
take
us
in
you
can
do
all
that
with
wires
conjurer
and
without
looking
up
from
the
yes
i
could
do
all
that
with
wires
morris
and
you
reckoned
i
should
know
with
a
high
crowing
that
how
the
derned
dirty
spiritualists
do
all
their
tricks
they
say
they
can
make
the
furniture
move
of
itself
if
it
does
move
they
move
it
and
we
mean
to
know
how
chair
falls
over
with
a
slight
morris
staggers
and
momentarily
fights
for
breath
and
morris
you
why
that
every
one
knows
that
a
sliding
plank
it
can
be
done
with
a
sliding
plank
conjurer
looking
yes
it
can
be
done
with
a
sliding
plank
doctor
nearer
morris
faces
about
addressing
him
morris
you
were
right
on
the
spot
doc
when
you
talked
about
that
red
lamp
of
yours
that
red
lamp
is
the
light
of
science
that
will
put
out
all
the
lanterns
of
your
turnip
ghosts
it
a
consuming
fire
doctor
but
it
is
the
red
light
of
the
morning
at
it
in
exalted
your
priests
can
no
more
stop
that
light
from
shining
or
change
its
colour
and
its
radiance
than
joshua
could
stop
the
sun
and
moon
why
a
real
fairy
in
an
elfin
cloak
strayed
too
near
the
lamp
an
hour
or
two
ago
and
it
turned
him
into
a
common
society
clown
with
a
white
tie
lamp
at
the
end
of
the
garden
turns
blue
they
all
look
at
it
in
morris
the
silence
on

put
a
wire
no

ca
be
it
doctor
to
him
well
well
just
at
this
moment
we
need
not
inquire
morris
on
him
you
call
yourself
a
man
of
science
and
you
dare
to
tell
me
not
to
inquire
smith
we
only
mean
that
for
the
moment
you
might
let
it
alone
morris
no
priest
i
will
not
let
it
alone
the
room
could
it
be
done
with
mirrors
clasps
his
you
have
a
mirror
with
a
i
got
it
i
got
it
mixture
of
lights
why
not
if
you
throw
a
green
light
on
a
red
light
smith
to
doctor
you
do
get
blue
doctor
across
to
conjurer
if
you
have
done
this
trick
for
god
sake
undo
it
a
silence
the
light
turns
red
morris
suddenly
to
the
glass
doors
and
examining
the
glass
you
been
doing
something
to
the
glass
stops
suddenly
and
there
is
a
long
conjurer
without
i
do
think
you
will
find
anything
wrong
with
the
glass
morris
open
the
glass
doors
with
a
then
i
find
out
what
wrong
with
the
lamp
into
the
doctor

is
still
a
wet
night
i
am
afraid
smith

somebody
else
will
be
wandering
about
the
garden
now
the
broken
glass
morris
be
seen
marching
backwards
and
forwards
with
swifter
and
swifter
smith

this
case
the
celtic
twilight

on
the
chest
doctor
oh
if
it
were
only
the
chest
patricia
patricia
where
is
my
brother
is
an
embarrassed
silence
in
which
conjurer
conjurer

am
afraid
he
is
walking
about
in
fairyland
patricia
but
he
must
go
out
on
a
night
like
this
it
very
dangerous
conjurer
yes
it
is
very
dangerous
he
might
meet
a
fairy
patricia
what
do
you
mean
conjurer
you
went
out
in
this
sort
of
weather
and
you
met
this
sort
of
fairy
and
so
far
it
has
only
brought
you
sorrow
patricia
i
am
going
out
to
find
my
brother
goes
out
into
the
garden
through
the
open
smith
a
silence
very
what
is
that
noise
she
is
not
singing
those
songs
to
him
is
she
conjurer
no
he
does
not
understand
the
language
of
the
elves
smith
but
what
are
all
those
cries
and
gasps
i
hear
conjurer
the
normal
noises
i
believe
of
a
quiet
business
man
doctor
sir
i
can
understand
your
being
bitter
for
i
admit
you
have
been
uncivilly
received
but
to
speak
like
that
just
now
patricia
at
the
garden
doors
very
patricia
can
i
speak
to
the
doctor
doctor
my
dear
lady
certainly
shall
i
fetch
the
duke
patricia
i
would
prefer
the
doctor
smith
can
i
be
of
any
use
patricia
i
only
want
the
doctor
goes
out
again
followed
grimthorpe
others
look
at
each
smith
that
last
was
a
wonderful
trick
of
yours
conjurer
thank
you
i
suppose
you
mean
it
was
the
only
one
you
see
through
smith
something
of
the
kind
i
confess
your
last
trick
was
the
best
trick
i
have
ever
seen
it
is
so
good
that
i
wish
you
had
not
done
it
conjurer
and
so
do
smith
how
do
you
mean
do
you
wish
you
had
never
been
a
conjurer
conjurer
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
conjurer
silence
doctor
very
doctor
it
is
all
right
so
far
we
have
brought
him
back
smith
near
to
you
told
me
there
was
mental
trouble
with
the
girl
doctor
at
him
no
i
told
you
there
was
mental
trouble
in
the
family
smith
a
where
is
morris
carleon
doctor
i
have
got
him
into
bed
in
the
next
room
his
sister
is
looking
after
him
smith
his
sister
oh
then
do
you
believe
in
fairies
doctor
believe
in
fairies
what
do
you
mean
smith
at
least
you
put
the
person
who
does
believe
in
them
in
charge
of
the
person
who
does
doctor
well
i
suppose
i
do
smith
you
do
think
she
keep
him
awake
all
night
with
fairy
tales
doctor
certainly
not
smith
you
do
think
she
throw
the
out
of
window
and
administer
er
a
dewdrop
or
anything
of
that
sort
or
a
clover
say
doctor
no
of
course
not
smith
i
only
ask
because
you
scientific
men
are
a
little
hard
on
us
clergymen
you
do
believe
in
a
priesthood
but
you
admit
i
more
really
a
priest
than
this
conjurer
is
really
a
magician
you
been
talking
a
lot
about
the
bible
and
the
higher
criticism
but
even
by
the
higher
criticism
the
bible
is
older
than
the
language
of
the
elves
which
was
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
invented
this
afternoon
but
miss
carleon
believed
in
the
wizard
miss
carleon
believed
in
the
language
of
the
elves
and
you
put
her
in
charge
of
an
invalid
without
a
flicker
of
doubt
because
you
trust
women
doctor
yes
i
trust
women
smith
you
trust
a
woman
with
the
practical
issues
of
life
and
death
through
sleepless
hours
when
a
shaking
hand
or
an
extra
grain
would
kill
doctor
yes
smith
but
if
the
woman
gets
up
to
go
to
early
service
at
my
church
you
call
her
and
say
that
nobody
but
women
can
believe
in
religion
doctor
i
should
never
call
this
woman
no
by
god
not
even
if
she
went
to
church
smith
yet
there
are
many
as
who
believe
passionately
in
going
to
church
doctor
were
there
as
many
who
believed
passionately
in
apollo
smith
and
what
harm
came
of
believing
in
apollo
and
what
a
mass
of
harm
may
have
come
of
not
believing
in
apollo
does
it
never
strike
you
that
doubt
can
be
a
madness
as
well
be
faith
that
asking
questions
may
be
a
disease
as
well
as
proclaiming
doctrines
you
talk
of
religious
mania
is
there
no
such
thing
as
irreligious
mania
is
there
no
such
thing
in
the
house
at
this
moment
doctor
then
you
think
no
one
should
question
at
all
smith
passion
pointing
to
the
next
i
think
is
what
comes
of
questioning
why
ca
you
leave
the
universe
alone
and
let
it
mean
what
it
likes
why
should
the
thunder
be
jupiter
more
men
have
made
themselves
silly
by
wondering
what
the
devil
it
was
if
it
was
jupiter
doctor
at
do
you
believe
in
your
own
religion
smith
the
look
equally
suppose
i
do
i
should
still
be
a
fool
to
question
it
the
child
who
doubts
about
santa
claus
has
insomnia
the
child
who
believes
has
a
good
night
rest
doctor
you
are
a
pragmatist
duke
smith
that
is
what
the
lawyers
call
vulgar
abuse
but
i
do
appeal
to
practise
here
is
a
family
over
which
you
tell
me
a
mental
calamity
hovers
here
is
the
boy
who
questions
everything
and
a
girl
who
can
believe
anything
upon
which
has
the
curse
fallen
duke
talking
about
the
pragmatists
i
glad
to
hear
ah
very
forward
movement
i
suppose
roosevelt
now
well
we
move
you
know
we
move
first
there
was
the
missing
link
no
there
was
protoplasm
and
there
was
the
missing
link
and
magna
carta
and
so
on
why
look
at
the
insurance
act
doctor
i
would
rather
not
duke
a
playful
finger
at
ah
prejudice
prejudice
you
doctors
you
know
well
i
never
had
any
myself
doctor
the
silence
in
unusual
any
what
duke
never
had
any
marconis
myself
would
touch
well
i
must
speak
to
hastings
duke
doctor
well
of
all
the
smith
you
asked
me
just
now
which
member
of
the
family
had
inherited
the
family
madness
smith
yes
i
did
doctor
a
low
emphatic
on
my
living
soul
i
believe
it
must
be
the
duke
curtain
act
iii
partly
darkened
a
table
with
a
lamp
on
it
and
an
empty
chair
from
room
next
door
faint
and
occasional
sounds
of
the
tossing
or
talking
of
the
doctor
grimthorpe
a
rather
careworn
air
and
a
medicine
bottle
in
his
hand
he
puts
it
on
the
table
and
sits
down
in
the
chair
as
if
keeping
a
conjurer
his
bag
and
cloaked
for
departure
as
he
crosses
the
room
doctor
and
calls
after
doctor
forgive
me
but
may
i
detain
you
for
one
moment
i
suppose
you
are
aware
that
that
there
have
been
rather
grave
developments
in
the
case
of
illness
which
happened
after
your
performance
i
would
not
say
of
course
because
of
your
performance
conjurer
thank
you
doctor
encouraged
but
speaking
very
nevertheless
mental
excitement
is
necessarily
an
element
of
importance
in
physiological
troubles
and
your
triumphs
this
evening
were
really
so
extraordinary
that
i
can
not
pretend
to
dismiss
them
from
my
case
he
is
at
present
in
a
state
somewhat
analogous
to
delirium
but
in
which
he
can
still
partially
ask
and
answer
questions
the
question
he
continually
asks
is
how
you
managed
to
do
your
last
trick
conjurer
ah
my
last
trick
doctor
now
i
was
wondering
whether
we
could
make
any
arrangement
which
would
be
fair
to
you
in
the
matter
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
give
me
in
confidence
the
means
of
satisfying
this
this
fixed
idea
he
seems
to
have
got
hesitates
again
and
picks
his
words
more
this
special
condition
of
disputation
is
a
rare
one
and
connected
in
my
experience
with
rather
unfortunate
cases
conjurer
at
him
do
you
mean
he
is
going
mad
doctor
taken
aback
for
the
first
really
you
ask
me
an
unfair
question
i
could
not
explain
the
fine
shades
of
these
things
to
a
layman
and
even
if
if
what
you
suggest
were
so
i
should
have
to
regard
it
as
a
professional
secret
conjurer
looking
at
and
do
you
think
you
ask
me
a
rather
unfair
question
grimthorpe
if
yours
is
a
professional
secret
is
not
mine
a
professional
secret
too
if
you
may
hide
truth
from
the
world
why
may
not
i
you
do
tell
your
tricks
i
do
tell
my
tricks
doctor
some
ours
are
not
tricks
conjurer
ah
no
one
can
be
sure
of
that
till
the
tricks
are
told
doctor
but
the
public
can
see
a
doctor
cures
as
plain
as
conjurer
yes
as
plain
as
they
saw
the
red
lamp
over
his
door
this
evening
doctor
a
your
secret
of
course
would
be
strictly
kept
by
every
one
involved
conjurer
oh
of
course
people
in
delirium
always
keep
secrets
strictly
doctor
no
one
sees
the
patient
but
his
sister
and
myself
conjurer
yes
his
sister
is
she
very
anxious
doctor
a
lower
what
would
you
suppose
conjurer
himself
into
the
chair
his
cloak
slipping
back
from
his
evening
dress
he
ruminates
for
a
short
space
and
then
conjurer
doctor
there
are
about
a
thousand
reasons
why
i
should
not
tell
you
how
i
really
did
that
trick
but
one
will
suffice
because
it
is
the
most
practical
of
all
doctor
well
and
why
should
you
tell
me
conjurer
because
you
would
believe
me
if
i
did
silence
doctor
at
him
duke
papers
in
his
hand
his
usual
gaiety
of
manner
has
a
rather
forced
air
owing
to
the
fact
that
by
some
vague
associations
he
walks
as
if
on
and
begins
to
speak
in
a
sort
of
loud
or
shrill
whisper
this
he
fortunately
forgets
and
falls
into
his
more
natural
duke
conjurer
so
very
kind
of
you
to
have
waited
professor
i
expect
grimthorpe
has
explained
the
little
difficulty
we
are
in
much
better
than
i
could
nothing
like
the
medical
mind
for
a
scientific
statement
look
at
ibsen
doctor
of
course
the
professor
feels
considerable
reluctance
in
the
matter
he
points
out
that
his
secrets
are
an
essential
part
of
his
profession
duke
of
course
of
course
tricks
of
the
trade
eh
very
proper
of
course
quite
a
case
of
but
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
matter
turns
to
conjurer
now
my
dear
sir
i
hope
you
will
not
be
offended
if
i
say
that
this
ought
to
be
a
business
matter
we
are
asking
you
for
a
piece
of
your
professional
work
and
knowledge
and
if
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
writing
you
a
cheque
conjurer
i
thank
your
grace
i
have
already
received
my
cheque
from
your
secretary
you
will
find
it
on
the
counterfoil
just
after
the
cheque
you
so
kindly
gave
to
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
conjuring
duke
now
i
do
want
you
to
take
it
in
that
way
i
want
you
to
take
it
in
a
broader
way
free
you
know
an
expansive
modern
and
all
that
wonderful
man
bernard
shaw
doctor
a
slight
cough
if
you
feel
any
delicacy
the
payment
need
not
be
made
merely
to
you
i
quite
respect
your
feelings
in
the
matter
duke
quite
so
quite
so
have
you
got
a
cause
or
something
everybody
has
a
cause
now
you
know
conjurers
widows
or
something
of
that
kind
conjurer
no
i
have
no
widows
duke
then
something
like
a
pension
or
annuity
for
any
widows
you
may
er
procure
opening
his
and
talking
slang
to
show
there
is
no
come
let
me
call
it
a
couple
of
thou
conjurer
the
cheque
and
looks
at
it
in
a
grave
and
doubtful
way
as
he
does
so
rector
slowly
into
the
conjurer
you
would
really
be
willing
to
pay
a
sum
like
this
to
know
the
way
i
did
that
trick
duke
i
would
willingly
pay
much
more
doctor
i
think
i
explained
to
you
that
the
case
is
serious
conjurer
and
more
you
would
pay
much
more
but
suppose
i
tell
you
the
secret
and
you
find
nothing
in
it
doctor
you
mean
that
it
really
quite
simple
why
i
should
say
that
that
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
a
little
healthy
laughter
is
the
best
possible
thing
for
convalescence
conjurer
looking
gloomily
at
the
i
do
not
think
you
will
laugh
duke
but
as
you
say
it
is
something
quite
simple
conjurer
it
is
the
simplest
thing
there
is
in
the
world
that
is
why
you
will
not
laugh
doctor
why
what
do
you
mean
what
shall
we
do
conjurer
you
will
disbelieve
it
doctor
and
why
conjurer
because
it
is
so
simple
springs
suddenly
to
his
feet
the
cheque
still
in
his
you
ask
me
how
i
really
did
the
last
trick
i
will
tell
you
how
i
did
the
last
trick
i
did
it
by
magic
duke
doctor
at
him
motionless
but
rev
smith
and
takes
a
step
nearer
the
table
conjurer
his
cloak
round
his
shoulders
this
gesture
as
of
departure
brings
doctor
his
doctor
and
do
you
really
mean
that
you
take
the
cheque
and
then
tell
us
it
was
only
magic
conjurer
the
cheque
to
i
tear
the
cheque
and
i
tell
you
it
was
only
magic
doctor
violent
but
hang
it
all
there
no
such
thing
conjurer
yes
there
is
i
wish
to
god
i
did
not
know
that
there
is
duke
why
really
magic
conjurer
yes
your
grace
one
of
those
larger
laws
you
were
telling
us
about
buttons
his
cloak
up
at
his
throat
and
takes
up
his
bag
as
he
does
so
rev
smith
between
him
and
the
door
and
stops
him
for
a
smith
a
low
one
moment
sir
conjurer
what
do
you
want
smith
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
i
mean
on
behalf
of
the
company
i
think
it
was
wrong
to
offer
you
money
i
think
it
was
more
wrong
to
mystify
you
with
medical
language
and
call
the
thing
delirium
i
have
more
respect
for
conjurer
patter
than
for
doctor
patter
they
are
both
meant
to
stupify
but
yours
only
to
stupify
for
a
moment
now
i
put
it
to
you
in
plain
words
and
on
plain
human
christian
grounds
here
is
a
poor
boy
who
may
be
going
mad
suppose
you
had
a
son
in
such
a
position
would
you
not
expect
people
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
if
it
could
help
you
conjurer
yes
and
i
have
told
you
the
whole
truth

more
smith
you

it
will
not
help
us
conjurer
why
not
smith
you
know
quite
well
why
not
you
are
an
honest
man
and
you
have
said
it
yourself
because
he
would
not
believe
it
conjurer
a
sort
of
well
does
anybody
believe
it
do
you
believe
it
smith
great
your
question

it
let
me
take
your
cloak
conjurer
i
will
take
off
my
cloak

coat
smith
why
do
you
want
me
to
fight
conjurer
i
want
you
to
be
martyred
i
want
you
to
witness
to
your
own
creed
i
say
these
things
are
supernatural
i
say
this
was
done
by
a
spirit
the
doctor
does
not
believe
me
he
is
an
agnostic
and
he
knows
everything
the
duke
does
not
believe
me
he
can
not
believe
anything
so
plain
as
a
miracle
but
what
the
devil
are
you
for
if
you
do
believe
in
a
miracle
what
does
your
coat
mean
if
it
does
mean
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
supernatural
what
does
your
cursed
collar
mean
if
it
does
mean
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
spirit
why
the
devil
do
you
dress
up
like
that
if
you
do
believe
in
it
or
perhaps
you
believe
in
devils
smith
i
believe
a
i
wish
i
could
believe
conjurer
yes
i
wish
i
could
disbelieve
patricia
and
in
the
slight
négligée
of
the
amateur
patricia
may
i
speak
to
the
conjurer
smith
you
want
the
doctor
patricia
no
the
conjurer
doctor

developments

i
only
want
to
speak
to
the
conjurer

either
at
the
garden
or
the
other

trick

know
my
poor
brother
was
rude
to
you
he
rude
to
everybody
but
he
such
a
little
little
boy
conjurer
i
suppose
you
know
there
are
things
men
never
tell
to
women
they
are
too
horrible
patricia
yes
and
there
are
things
women
never
tell
to
men
they
also
are
too
horrible
i
am
here
to
hear
them
all
conjurer
do
you
really
mean
i
may
say
anything
i
like
however
dark
it
is
however
dreadful
it
is
however
damnable
it
is
patricia
i
have
gone
through
too
much
to
be
terrified
now
tell
me
the
very
worst
conjurer
i
will
tell
you
the
very
worst
i
fell
in
love
with
you
when
i
first
saw
you
down
and
crosses
his
patricia
you
told
me
i
looked
like
a
child
and
conjurer
i
told
a
lie
patricia
o
this
is
terrible
conjurer
i
was
in
love
i
took
an
opportunity
you
believed
quite
simply
that
i
was
a
magician
but
i
patricia
it
is
terrible
it
is
terrible
i
never
believed
you
were
a
magician
conjurer
never
believed
i
was
a
magician
patricia
i
always
knew
you
were
a
man
conjurer
whatever
passionate
things
people
do
on
the
i
am
a
man
and
you
are
a
woman
and
all
the
elves
have
gone
to
elfland
and
all
the
devils
to
hell
and
you
and
i
will
walk
out
of
this
great
vulgar
house
and
be
married
every
one
is
crazy
in
this
house
i
think
what
am
i
saying
as
if
could
marry
o
my
god
patricia
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
failed
in
courage
conjurer
what
do
you
mean
patricia
i
mean
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
you
have
recently
made
an
offer
i
accept
it
conjurer
oh
it
nonsense
it
nonsense
how
can
a
man
marry
an
archangel
let
alone
a
lady
my
mother
was
a
lady
and
she
married
a
dying
fiddler
who
tramped
the
roads
and
the
mixture
plays
the
cat
and
banjo
with
my
body
and
soul
i
can
see
my
mother
now
cooking
food
in
dirtier
and
dirtier
lodgings
darning
socks
with
weaker
and
weaker
eyes
when
she
might
have
worn
pearls
by
consenting
to
be
a
rational
person
patricia
and
she
might
have
grown
pearls
by
consenting
to
be
an
oyster
conjurer
there
was
little
pleasure
in
her
life
patricia
there
is
little
a
very
little
in
everybody
the
question
is
what
kind
we
ca
turn
life
into
a
pleasure
but
we
can
choose
such
pleasures
as
are
worthy
of
us
and
our
immortal
souls
your
mother
chose
and
i
have
chosen
conjurer
immortal
souls
and
i
suppose
if
i
knelt
down
to
worship
you
you
and
every
one
else
would
laugh
patricia
a
smile
of
well
i
think
this
is
a
more
comfortable
way
sits
down
suddenly
beside
him
in
a
sort
of
domestic
way
and
goes
on
yes
i
do
everything
your
mother
did
not
so
well
of
course
i
darn
that
conjurer
hat
does
one
darn
hats
and
cook
the
conjurer
dinner
by
the
way
what
is
a
conjurer
dinner
there
always
the
goldfish
of
course
conjurer
a
carrots
patricia
and
of
course
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
can
always
take
rabbits
out
of
the
hat
why
what
a
cheap
life
it
must
be
how
do
you
cook
rabbits
the
duke
is
always
talking
about
poached
rabbits
really
we
shall
be
as
happy
as
is
good
for
us
we
have
confidence
in
each
other
at
least
and
no
secrets
i
insist
on
knowing
all
the
tricks
conjurer
i
do
think
i
know
whether
i
on
my
head
or
my
heels
patricia
and
now
as
we
going
to
be
so
confidential
and
comfortable
you
just
tell
me
the
real
practical
tricky
little
way
you
did
that
last
trick
conjurer
rigid
with
how
i
did
that
trick
i
did
it
by
devils
furiously
patricia
you
could
believe
in
fairies
ca
you
believe
in
devils
patricia
no
i
ca
believe
in
devils
conjurer
well
this
room
is
full
of
them
patricia
what
does
it
all
mean
conjurer
it
only
means
that
i
have
done
what
many
men
have
done
but
few
i
think
have
thriven
by
sits
down
and
talks
i
told
you
i
had
mixed
with
many
queer
sets
of
people
among
others
i
mixed
with
those
who
pretend
truly
and
falsely
to
do
our
tricks
by
the
aid
of
spirits
i
dabbled
a
little
in
and
but
i
soon
had
reason
to
give
it
up
patricia
why
did
you
give
it
up
conjurer
it
began
by
giving
me
headaches
and
i
found
that
every
morning
after
a
spiritualist
i
had
a
queer
feeling
of
lowness
and
degradation
of
having
been
soiled
much
like
the
feeling
i
suppose
that
people
have
the
morning
after
they
have
been
drunk
but
i
happen
to
have
what
people
call
a
strong
head
and
i
have
never
been
really
drunk
patricia
i
am
glad
of
that
conjurer
it
has
been
for
want
of
trying
but
it
was
long
before
the
spirits
with
whom
i
had
been
playing
at
did
what
i
think
they
generally
do
at
the
end
of
all
such
patricia
what
did
they
do
conjurer
they
turned
the
tables
they
turned
the
tables
upon
me
i
do
wonder
at
your
believing
in
fairies
as
long
as
these
things
were
my
servants
they
seemed
to
me
like
fairies
when
they
tried
to
be
my
masters
i
found
they
were
not
fairies
i
found
the
spirits
with
whom
i
at
least
had
come
in
contact
were
evil
awfully
unnaturally
evil
patricia
did
they
say
so
conjurer
do
talk
of
what
they
said
i
was
a
loose
fellow
but
i
had
not
fallen
so
low
as
such
things
i
resisted
them
and
after
a
pretty
bad
time
psychologically
speaking
i
cut
the
connexion
but
they
were
always
tempting
me
to
use
the
supernatural
power
i
had
got
from
them
it
was
not
very
great
but
it
was
enough
to
move
things
about
to
alter
lights
and
so
on
i
do
know
whether
you
realize
that
it
rather
a
strain
on
a
man
to
drink
bad
coffee
at
a
when
he
knows
he
has
just
enough
magic
in
him
to
make
a
bottle
of
champagne
walk
out
of
an
empty
shop
patricia
i
think
you
behaved
very
well
conjurer
and
when
i
fell
at
last
it
was
for
nothing
half
so
clean
and
christian
as
champagne
in
black
blind
pride
and
anger
and
all
kinds
of
heathenry
because
of
the
impudence
of
a
schoolboy
i
called
on
the
fiends
and
they
obeyed
patricia
his
poor
fellow
conjurer
your
goodness
is
the
only
goodness
that
never
goes
wrong
patricia
and
what
we
to
do
with
morris
i
i
believe
you
now
my
dear
but
he
he
will
never
believe
conjurer
there
is
no
bigot
like
the
atheist
i
must
think
towards
the
garden
windows
the
other
men
reappear
to
arrest
his
doctor
where
are
you
going
conjurer
i
am
going
to
ask
the
god
whose
enemies
i
have
served
if
i
am
still
worthy
to
save
a
child
into
garden
he
paces
up
and
down
exactly
morris
done
as
he
does
patricia
goes
out
and
a
long
silence
follows
during
which
the
remaining
men
stir
and
stamp
very
restlessly
the
darkness
increases
it
is
long
before
anyone
doctor

that
conjurer

very
curious
man
a
kind
of
man
you

lord
bless

what
what
eh
what
what
doctor
i
swear
i
heard
a
footstep
hastings
duke
why

thought
you
were
a
ghost
you
must
be

looking

brought
back
the
answer
of
the
i
mean
the
vegetarians
one
or
two
duke
why
hastings
you
looking
white
hastings
i
ask
your
grace
pardon
i
had
a
slight
shock
on
entering
the
room
doctor
a
shock
what
shock
hastings
it
is
the
first
time
i
think
that
your
grace
work
has
been
disturbed
by
any
private
feelings
of
mine
i
shall
not
trouble
your
grace
with
them
it
will
not
occur
again
hastings
duke
what
an
extraordinary
fellow
i
wonder
if
stops
doctor
a
long
silence
in
a
low
voice
smith
how
do
you
feel
smith
i
feel
i
must
have
a
window
shut
or
i
must
have
it
open
and
i
do
know
which
it
is
long
smith
out
suddenly
in
the
in
god
name
go
doctor
up
rather
in
a
really
sir
i
am
not
used
to
being
spoken
to
smith
it
was
not
you
whom
i
told
to
go
doctor
no
but
i
think
i
will
go
this
room
is
simply
horrible
marches
towards
the
duke
up
and
bustling
about
altering
cards
papers
on
room
horrible
room
horrible
no
no
no
to
run
quicker
round
the
room
flapping
his
hands
like
only
a
little
crowded
a
little
crowded
and
i
do
seem
to
know
all
the
people
we
ca
like
everybody
these
large
on
to
a
conjurer
at
the
garden
go
back
to
hell
from
which
i
called
you
it
is
the
last
order
i
shall
give
doctor
rather
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
conjurer
i
am
going
to
tell
that
poor
little
lad
a
lie
i
have
found
in
the
garden
what
he
did
not
find
in
the
garden
i
have
managed
to
think
of
a
natural
explanation
of
that
trick
doctor
i
think
you
are
something
like
a
great
man
can
i
take
your
explanation
to
him
now
conjurer
no
thank
you
i
will
take
it
myself
into
the
other
duke
we
all
felt
devilish
queer
just
now
wonderful
things
there
are
in
the
world
a
i
suppose
it
all
electricity
as
smith
i
think
there
has
been
more
than
electricity
in
all
this
patricia
pale
but
patricia
oh
morris
is
ever
so
much
better
the
conjurer
has
told
him
such
a
good
story
of
how
the
trick
was
done
conjurer
duke
professor
we
owe
you
a
thousand
thanks
doctor
really
you
have
doubled
your
claim
to
originality
smith
it
is
much
more
marvellous
to
explain
a
miracle
than
to
work
a
miracle
what
was
your
explanation
by
the
way
conjurer
i
shall
not
tell
you
smith
indeed
why
not
conjurer
because
god
and
the
demons
and
that
immortal
mystery
that
you
deny
has
been
in
this
room
because
you
know
it
has
been
here
because
you
have
felt
it
here
because
you
know
the
spirits
as
well
as
i
do
and
fear
them
as
much
as
i
do
smith
well
conjurer
because
all
this
would
not
avail
if
i
told
you
the
lie
i
told
morris
carleon
about
how
i
did
that
trick
smith
well
conjurer
you
would
believe
it
as
he
believed
it
you
can
not
think
to
the
how
that
trick
could
be
done
naturally
i
alone
found
out
how
it
could
be
done
after
i
had
done
it
by
magic
but
if
i
tell
you
a
natural
way
of
doing
it
smith
well
conjurer
half
an
hour
after
i
have
left
this
house
you
will
be
all
saying

it
was
done

one

telling

evoked
such
keen
local
interest
that
an
old
farmer
travelled
from

acted

the
story
of
on

of

was
taken
entirely
from

young
woman

have
been
married
to
finn
the
great
leader
of
the
fenians

before
the
marriage
she
went
away
from
the
bridegroom
with
his
handsome
young
kinsman

after
many
years
when
diarmuid
had
died
and

had
a
hand
in

death
she
went

another

the

gives

freshness

all

london
has

this

a
play
of
serious
importance
not
approached
by
any

book

drama
of

strife
it
is
regarded
not
merely
as
a
remarkable
social
document
of
significance
but
as
a
creation
which
while
of
the
most
modern
realism
is
yet
classic
in
its
pronounced
art
and
exalted
philosophy
the
play
shows
the
types
of
the
strongest
men
as
victims
of
comical
events
and
of
weaker
men
it
will
be
produced
in
america
where
on
account
of
its
realistic
treatment
of
the
subject
of
labor

it
is
sure
to
be
