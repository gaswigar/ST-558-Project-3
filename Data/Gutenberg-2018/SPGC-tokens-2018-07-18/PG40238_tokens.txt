preface
the
voyage

the
election
the
object
of
this
book
is
to
describe
a
new
mode
of
travelling
on
the
continent
by
which
new
people
and
things
are
met
with
while
healthy
exercise
is
enjoyed
and
an
interest
ever
varied
with
excitement
keeps
fully
alert
the
energies
of
the
mind
some
years
ago
the
water
lily
was
rowed
by
four
men
on
the
rhine
and
on
the
danube
and
its
log
delighted
all
readers
afterwards
the
boat
water
witch
laboured
up
french
rivers
and
through
a
hundred
tedious
locks
on
the
bâle
canal
but
these
and
other
voyages
of
three
or
five
men
in
an
open
boat
were
necessarily
very
limited
in
the
wildest
parts
of
the
best
rivers
the
channel
is
too
narrow
for
oars
or
if
wide
it
is
too
shallow
for
a
and
the
tortuous
passages
the
rocks
and
banks
the
weeds
and
snags
the
milldams
barriers
fallen
trees
rapids
whirlpools
and
waterfalls
that
constantly
occur
on
a
river
winding
among
hills
make
those
very
parts
where
the
scenery
is
wildest
and
best
to
be
quite
unapproachable
in
an
open
boat
for
it
would
be
swamped
by
the
sharp
waves
or
upset
over
the
sunken
rocks
which
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
a
steersman
to
see
but
these
very
things
which
are
obstacles
or
dangers
to
the
pair
oar
become
interesting
features
to
the
voyager
in
a
covered
canoe
for
now
as
he
sits
in
his
little
bark
he
looks
forward
and
not
backward
he
sees
all
his
course
and
the
scenery
besides
with
one
powerful
sweep
of
his
paddle
he
can
instantly
turn
the
canoe
when
only
a
foot
distant
from
fatal
destruction
he
can
steer
within
an
inch
in
a
narrow
place
or
pass
through
reeds
and
weeds
branches
and
grass
can
hoist
and
lower
his
sail
without
changing
his
seat
can
shove
with
his
paddle
when
aground
or
jump
out
in
good
time
to
prevent
a
decided
smash
he
can
wade
and
haul
the
light
craft
over
shallows
or
drag
it
on
dry
ground
through
fields
and
hedges
over
dykes
barriers
and
walls
can
carry
it
by
hand
up
ladders
and
stairs
and
can
transport
his
boat
over
high
mountains
and
broad
plains
in
a
cart
drawn
by
a
horse
a
bullock
or
a
cow
nay
more
than
this
the
covered
canoe
is
far
stronger
than
an
open
boat
and
may
be
fearlessly
dropped
headforemost
into
a
deep
pool
a
lock
or
a
millrace
and
yet
when
the
breakers
are
high
in
the
open
sea
or
in
fresh
water
rapids
they
can
only
wash
over
the
covered
deck
while
it
is
always
dry
within
again
the
canoe
is
safer
than
a
because
you
sit
so
low
in
it
and
never
require
to
shift
your
place
or
lose
hold
of
the
paddle
while
for
comfort
during
long
hours
for
days
and
weeks
of
hard
work
it
is
evidently
the
best
because
you
lean
all
the
time
against
a
backboard
and
the
moment
you
rest
the
paddle
on
your
lap
you
are
as
much
at
ease
as
in
an
so
that
while
drifting
along
with
the
current
or
the
wind
you
can
gaze
around
and
eat
or
read
or
chat
with
the
starers
on
the
bank
and
yet
in
a
moment
of
sudden
danger
the
hands
are
at
once
on
the
faithful
paddle
ready
for
action
finally
you
can
lie
at
full
length
in
the
canoe
with
the
sail
as
an
awning
for
the
sun
or
a
shelter
for
rain
and
you
can
sleep
in
it
thus
at
night
under
cover
with
an
opening
for
air
to
leeward
and
at
least
as
much
room
for
turning
in
your
bed
as
sufficed
for
the
great
duke
of
wellington
or
if
you
are
tired
of
the
water
for
a
time
you
can
leave
your
boat
at
an
inn
it
will
not
be
eating
its
head
off
like
a
horse
or
you
can
send
it
home
or
sell
it
and
take
to
the
road
yourself
or
sink
into
the
dull
old
cushions
of
the
première
classe
and
dream
you
are
seeing
the
world
with
such
advantages
then
and
with
good
weather
and
good
health
the
canoe
voyage
about
to
be
described
was
truly
delightful
and
i
never
enjoyed
so
much
continuous
pleasure
in
any
other
tour
but
before
this
deliberate
assertion
has
weight
with
intending
canoists
it
may
well
be
asked
from
one
who
thus
praises
the
paddle
has
he
travelled
in
other
ways
so
as
to
know
their
several
pleasures
has
he
climbed
glaciers
and
volcanoes
dived
into
caves
and
catacombs
trotted
in
the
norway
carriole
ambled
on
an
arab
and
galloped
on
the
russian
steppes
does
he
know
the
charms
of
a
nile
boat
or
a
trinity
eight
or
a
sail
in
the
ægean
or
a
mule
in
spain
has
he
swung
upon
a
camel
or
glided
in
a
sleigh
or
trundled
in
a
rantoone
yes
he
has
most
thoroughly
enjoyed
these
and
other
modes
of
locomotion
in
the
four
corners
of
the
world
but
the
pleasure
in
the
canoe
was
far
better
than
all
the
weather
last
summer
was
indeed
exceptionally
good
but
then
rain
would
have
diminished
some
of
the
difficulties
though
it
might
have
been
a
bore
to
paddle
ten
hours
in
a
downpour
two
inches
more
of
water
in
the
rivers
would
have
saved
many
a
grounding
and
wading
while
at
worst
the
rain
could
have
wetted
only
the
upper
man
which
a
cape
can
cover
so
even
in
bad
weather
give
me
the
canoe
searle
and
sons
of
lambeth
soon
built
for
me
the
very
boat
i
wanted
the
rob
roy
is
built
of
oak
and
covered
fore
and
aft
with
cedar
she
is
made
just
short
enough
to
go
into
the
german
railway
waggons
that
is
to
say
fifteen
feet
in
length
inches
broad
nine
inches
deep
weighs
eighty
pounds
and
draws
three
inches
of
water
with
an
inch
of
keel
a
paddle
seven
feet
long
with
a
blade
at
each
end
and
a
lug
sail
and
jib
are
the
means
of
propulsion
and
a
pretty
blue
silk
union
jack
is
the
only
ornament
the
elliptic
hole
in
which
i
sit
is
inches
long
and
twenty
broad
and
has
a
macintosh
cover
fastened
round
the
combing
and
to
a
button
on
my
breast
while
between
my
knees
is
my
baggage
for
three
months
in
a
black
bag
one
foot
square
and
five
inches
deep
but
having
got
this
little
boat
the
difficulty
was
to
find
where
she
could
go
to
or
what
rivers
were
at
once
feasible
to
paddle
on
and
pretty
to
see
inquiries
in
london
as
to
this
had
no
result
even
the
paris
boat
club
knew
nothing
of
french
rivers
the
best
german
and
austrian
maps
were
frequently
wrong
they
made
villages
on
the
banks
which
i
found
were
a
mile
away
in
a
wood
and
so
were
useless
to
one
who
had
made
up
his
mind
a
good
resolve
never
to
leave
his
boat
it
was
soon
therefore
evident
that
after
quitting
the
rhine
this
was
to
be
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
as
i
would
most
gladly
have
accepted
any
hints
on
the
matter
myself
so
i
venture
to
hope
that
this
narrative
will
lessen
the
trouble
while
it
stimulates
the
desire
of
the
numerous
travellers
who
will
spend
their
vacation
in
a
i
i
see
appendix
special
hints
for
those
who
intend
to
canoe
it
will
usually
be
given
in
the
footnotes
or
in
the
appendix
not
that
i
shall
attempt
to
make
a
handbook
to
any
of
the
streams
the
man
who
has
a
spark
of
enterprise
would
turn
from
a
river
of
which
every
reach
was
mapped
and
its
channels
all
lettered
fancy
the
free
traveller
equipped
for
a
delicious
summer
of
savage
life
quietly
submitting
to
be
cramped
and
tutored
by
a
chart
of
the
upper

in
the
style
of
the

of

situate
in
the
midst
of
verdant
meadows
in

a

where
the

this
sort
of
is
not
to
be
ridiculed
it
is
useful
for
some
travellers
as
a
ruled
is
of
use
to
some
writers
for
first
tours
it
may
be
needful
and
pleasant
to
have
all
made
easy
to
be
carried
in
steamers
or
railways
like
a
parcel
to
stop
at
hotels
anglified
by
the
crowd
of
english
guests
and
to
ride
walk
or
drive
among
people
who
know
already
just
what
you
will
want
to
eat
and
see
and
do
year
after
year
it
is
enough
of
excitement
to
some
tourists
to
be
shifted
in
squads
from
town
to
town
according
to
the
routine
of
an
excursion
ticket
those
who
are
a
little
more
advanced
will
venture
to
devise
a
tour
from
the
mazy
pages
of
bradshaw
and
with
portmanteau
and
bag
and
and
sticks
they
find
more
than
enough
of
judgment
and
tact
is
needed
when
they
arrive
in
a
night
train
and
must
fix
on
an
omnibus
in
a
strange
town
safe
at
last
in
the
bedroom
of
the
hotel
they
can
not
but
exclaim
with
satisfaction
well
here
we
are
all
right
at
last
but
after
mountains
and
caves
churches
and
galleries
ruins
and
have
been
pretty
well
seen
and
after
tact
and
fortitude
have
been
educated
by
experience
the
tourist
is
ready
for
new
lines
of
travel
which
might
have
given
him
at
first
more
anxiety
than
pleasure
and
these
he
will
find
in
deeper
searches
among
the
natural
scenery
and
national
character
of
the
very
countries
he
has
only
skimmed
before
the
rivers
and
streams
on
the
continent
are
scarcely
known
to
the
english
tourist
and
the
beauty
and
life
upon
them
no
one
has
well
seen
in
his
route
indeed
from
town
to
town
the
tourist
has
crossed
this
and
that
stream
has
admired
a
few
yards
of
the
water
and
has
then
left
it
for
ever
he
is
carried
again
on
a
noble
river
by
night
in
a
steamboat
or
is
whisked
along
its
banks
in
a
railway
and
between
two
tunnels
gets
a
moment
glimpse
at
the
lovely
water
and
lo
it
is
gone
but
a
mine
of
rich
beauty
remains
there
to
be
explored
and
fresh
gems
of
life
and
character
are
waiting
there
to
be
gathered
these
are
not
mapped
and
labelled
and
ticketed
in
any
handbook
yet
and
far
better
so
for
the
enjoyment
of
such
treasures
is
enhanced
to
the
best
traveller
by
the
energy
and
pluck
required
to
get
at
them
on
this
new
world
of
waters
we
are
to
launch
the
boat
the
man
and
his
baggage
for
we
must
describe
all
three
arma
virumque
canoe
so
what
sort
of
dress
did
he
wear
the
clothes
i
took
for
this
tour
consisted
of
a
complete
suit
of
grey
flannel
for
use
in
the
boat
and
another
suit
of
light
but
ordinary
dress
for
shore
work
and
sundays
the
norfolk
jacket
is
a
loose
like
a
blouse
with
and
belted
at
the
waist
and
garnished
by
six
pockets
with
this
excellent
coat
a
something
in
each
of
its
pockets
and
a
cambridge
straw
hat
canvas
wading
shoes
blue
spectacles
a
waterproof
overcoat
and
my
spare
jib
for
a
sun
shawl
there
was
sure
to
be
a

pull
and
then
with
a

in
the
river
or
a
bath
at
the
inn
a

of
garments
and
a
pleasant
walk
all
was
made

and

now
i
foresee
that
in
the
description
of
this
tour
i
shall
have
to
write
i
and
the
word
me
must
be
used
by
me
very
often
indeed
but
having
the
misfortune
to
be
neither
an
emperor
an
editor
nor
a
married
man
who
can
speak
in
the
plural
i
can
not
help
it
if
i
am
put
down
as
a
bachelor
reserving
the
we
for
myself
and
my
boat
the
manner
of
working
the
paddle
was
easily
learned
by
a
few
days
practice
on
the
thames
and
so
excellent
is
the
exercise
for
the
muscles
of
the
limbs
and
body
that
i
have
continued
it
at
intervals
even
during
the
winter
when
a
pretty
sharp
look
out
must
be
kept
to
pilot
safely
among
the
red
and
yellow
lights
of
steamers
barges
embankments
and
bridges
in
an
evening
voyage
from
putney
to
westminster
all
being
ready
and
the
weather
very
hot
at
the
end
of
july
when
the
country
had
caught
the
election
fever
and
had
run
off
to
scramble
for
seats
and
the
lawyers
had
run
after
them
to
thicken
the
bustle
and
the
last
bullet
at
wimbledon
had
come
thud
on
the
target
it
was

for
the
rob

the

joyously
on

of
the
tide
through
westminster
bridge
and
swiftly
shooting
the
narrow
piles
at
blackfriars
danced
along
the
waves
of
the
pool
which
looked
all
golden
in
the
morning
sun
but
were
in
fact
of
veritable
hue
a
fine
breeze
at
greenwich
enabled
me
to
set
the
new
white
sail
and
we
skimmed
along
with
a
cheery
hissing
sound
at
such
times
the
river
is
a
lively
scene
with
steamers
and
ships
bluff
little
tugs
and
big
looming
barges
i
had
many
a
chat
with
the
passing
sailors
for
it
was
well
to
begin
this
at
once
seeing
that
every
day
afterwards
i
was
to
have
talk
with
the
river
folk
in
english
french
dutch
german
or
else
some
hotchpotch
patois
the
bargee
is
not
a
bad
fellow
if
you
begin
with
good
humour
but
he
will
not
stand
banter
often
they
began
the
colloquy
with
holloah
you
two
or
any
room
inside
or
got
your
life
insured
but
i
smiled
and
nodded
to
every
one
and
every
one
on
every
river
and
lake
was
friendly
to
me
gravesend
was
to
be
the
port
for
the
night
but
purfleet
looked
so
pretty
that
i
took
a
tack
or
two
to
reconnoitre
and
resolved
to
stop
at
the
very
nice
hotel
on
the
river
which
i
beg
to
recommend
while
lolling
about
in
my
boat
at
anchor
in
the
hot
sun
a
fly
stung
my
hand
and
although
it
was
not
remarked
at
once
the
arm
speedily
swelled
and
i
had
to
poultice
the
hand
at
night
and
to
go
to
church
next
day
with
a
sling
which
appendage
excited
a
great
deal
of
comment
in
the
village
this
little
incident
is
mentioned
because
it
was
the
only
occasion
on
which
any
insect
troubled
me
on
the
voyage
though
several
croakers
had
predicted
that
in
rivers
and
marshes
there
would
be
hundreds
of
wasps
venomous
flies
and
gnats
not
to
mention
other
residents
within
doors
just
as
i
entered
the
door
of
the
quiet
little
church
an
only
gentleman
about
to
go
in
fell
down
dead
in
the
path
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
much
impressed
with
this
sudden
death
as
a
solemn
warning
especially
to
one
in
vigorous
health
the
cornwall
reformatory
is
moored
at
purfleet
some
of
the
boys
came
ashore
for
a
walk
neatly
clad
and
very
well
behaved
captain
burton
who
commands
this
interesting
vessel
received
me
on
board
very
kindly
and
the
evening
service
between
decks
was
a
sight
to
remember
for
ever
about
boys
sat
in
rows
along
the
old
frigate
with
the
open
ports
looking
on
the
river
now
reddened
by
a
setting
sun
and
the
cool
air
pleasantly
fanning
us
the
lads
chanted
the
psalms
to
the
music
of
a
harmonium
played
with
excellent
feeling
and
good
taste
and
the
captain
read
a
suitable
portion
from
some
selected
book
and
then
prayer
was
offered
and
all
this
was
by
and
for
poor
vagrant
boys
whose
claim
on
society
is
great
indeed
if
measured
by
the
wrong
it
has
done
them
in
neglect
if
not
in
precept
nay
even
in
example
next
morning
the
canoe
was
lowered
down
a
ladder
from
the
where
it
had
been
kept
it
had
to
go
up
into
many
far
more
strange
places
in
subsequent
days
and
the
cornwall
boys
bid
me
a
pleasant
voyage
a
wish
most
fully
realized
indeed
after
taking
in
supplies
at
gravesend
i
shoved
off
into
the
tide
and
lit
a
cigar
and
now
i
felt
i
had
fairly
started
then
there
began
a
strange
feeling
of
and
which
lasted
to
the
end
of
the
tour
something
like
it
is
felt
when
you
first
march
off
with
a
knapsack
ready
to
walk
anywhere
or
when
you
start
alone
in
a
for
a
long
cruise
but
then
in
walking
you
are
bounded
by
every
sea
and
river
and
in
a
common
you
are
bounded
by
every
shallow
and
shore
whereas
i
was
in
a
canoe
which
could
be
paddled
or
sailed
hauled
or
carried
over
land
or
water
to
rome
if
i
liked
or
to
the
wind
was
fair
again
and
up
went
my
sail
the
reaches
got
wider
and
the
water
more
salt
but
i
knew
every
part
of
the
course
for
i
had
once
spent
a
fortnight
about
the
mouth
of
the
thames
in
my
pretty
little
the
kent
alone
with
only
a
dog
a
chart
a
compass
and
a
bachelor
kettle
the
new
steamer
alexandra
which
plies
from
london
daily
passed
me
here
its
american
decks
covered
with
people
and
the
crowd
gave
a
fine
loud
cheer
to
the
rob
roy
for
the
newspapers
had
mentioned
its
departure
presently
the
land
seemed
to
fade
away
at
each
side
in
pale
distance
and
the
water
was
more
sea
than
river
till
near
the
nore
we
entered
a
great
shoal
of
porpoises
often
as
i
have
seen
these
harmless
and
agile
playfellows
i
had
never
been
so
close
to
them
before
and
in
a
boat
so
small
as
to
be
almost
disregarded
by
them
wily
though
they
be
i
allowed
the
canoe
to
rock
on
the
waves
and
the
porpoises
frequently
came
near
enough
to
be
struck
by
my
paddle
but
i
did
not
wage
war
for
a
flap
of
a
tail
would
have
soon
turned
me
upside
down
after
a
pleasant
sail
to
southend
and
along
the
beach
the
wind
changed
and
a
storm
of
heavy
rain
had
to
be
met
in
its
teeth
by
taking
to
the
paddle
until
near
shoeburyness
where
i
meant
to
stop
a
day
or
two
in
the
camp
of
the
national
artillery
association
which
was
assembled
here
for
its
first
prize
shooting
the
royal
artillery
received
us
volunteers
on
this
occasion
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
as
they
had
appropriated
quarters
of
officers
absent
on
leave
for
the
use
of
members
of
the
council
of
the
association
i
was
soon
comfortably
ensconced
the
camp
however
in
a
wet
field
was
moist
enough
but
the
fine
tall
fellows
who
had
come
from
yorkshire
somerset
or
aberdeen
to
handle
the
trudged
about
in
the
mud
with
good
humour
and
thick
boots
and
sang
round
the
in
a
drizzle
of
rain
and
then
pounded
away
at
the
targets
next
day
for
these
were
volunteers
of
the
right
sort
as
the
wind
had
then
risen
to
a
gale
it
seemed
a
good
opportunity
for
a
thorough
trial
of
the
canoe
in
rough
water
so
i
paddled
her
to
a
corner
where
she
would
be
least
injured
by
being
thrown
ashore
after
an
upset
and
where
she
would
be
safe
while
i
might
run
to
change
clothes
after
a
swim
the
buoyancy
of
the
boat
astonished
me
and
her
stability
was
in
every
way
satisfactory
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
i
even
managed
to
rig
up
the
mast
and
sail
and
as
i
had
no
baggage
on
board
and
so
did
not
mind
being
perfectly
wet
through
in
the
experiments
there
was
nothing
left
untried
and
the
confidence
then
gained
for
after
times
was
invaluable
early
next
morning
i
started
directly
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
paddled
against
a
very
heavy
sea
to
southend
where
a
nice
warm
bath
was
enjoyed
while
my
clothes
were
getting
dried
and
then
the
rob
roy
had
its
first
railway
journey
in
one
of
the
little
cars
on
the
southend
pier
to
the
steamboat
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
much
interest
and
curiosity
the
canoe
excited
even
on
the
thames
where
all
kinds
of
new
and
old
and
wonderful
boats
may
be
seen
the
reasons
for
this
i
never
exactly
made
out
some
wondered
to
see
so
small
a
boat
at
sea
others
had
never
seen
a
canoe
before
the
manner
of
rowing
was
new
to
most
and
the
sail
made
many
smile
the
graceful
shape
of
the
boat
pleased
others
the
cedar
covering
and
the
jaunty
flag
and
a
good
many
stared
at
the
captain
uniform
and
they
stared
more
after
they
had
asked
where
are
you
going
to
and
were
often
told
i
really
do
not
know
from
sheerness
to
dover
was
the
route
and
on
the
branch
line
train
the
rob
roy
had
to
be
carried
on
the
coals
in
the
with
torrents
of
rain
and
plenty
of
hot
sparks
driven
into
her
by
the
gale
but
after
some
delay
at
a
junction
the
canoe
was
formally
introduced
to
a
and
ticketed
like
a
portmanteau
the
first
of
a
series
of
transits
in
this
way
the
london
chatham
and
dover
railway
company
took
this
new
kind
of
box
as
passengers
luggage
so
i
had
nothing
to
pay
and
the
steamer
to
ostend
was
equally
so
i
say
canoemen
choose
this
channel
but
before
crossing
to
belgium
i
had
a
day
at
dover
where
i
bought
some
stuff
and
had
a
jib
made
for
the
boat
by
deft
and
fair
fingers
had
paddled
the
rob
roy
on
the
green
waves
which
toss
about
off
the
most
delectably
the
same
performance
was
repeated
on
the
top
of
the
swell
tumbling
and
breaking
on
the
digue
ii
at
ostend
where
even
with
little
wind
the
rollers
ran
high
on
a
strong
ebb
tide
fat
bathers
wallowed
in
the
shallows
and
fair
ones
dressed
most
bizarre
were
swimming
like
ducks
all
of
these
and
the
babies
squalling
hysterically
at
each
dip
were
duly
admired
and
then
i
had
a
quieter
run
under
sail
on
their
wide
and
straight
canal
illustration
rollers
off
the
digue
ii
at
ostend
i
found
an
english
gentleman
preparing
for
a
voyage
on
the
danube
for
which
he
was
to
build
a
centre
board
boat
although
no
doubt
a
sailing
boat
could
reach
the
danube
by
the
bamberg
canal
yet
after
four
tours
on
that
river
from
its
source
as
far
as
pest
i
am
convinced
that
to
trust
to
sailing
upon
it
would
entail
much
tedious
delay
useless
trouble
and
constant
anxiety
if
the
wind
is
ahead
you
have
all
the
labour
of
tacking
and
are
frequently
in
slack
water
near
the
banks
and
often
in
channels
where
the
only
course
would
be
dead
to
windward
if
the
wind
is
aft
the
danger
of
running
is
extreme
where
you
have
to
broach
to
and
stop
suddenly
near
a
shallow
or
a
barrier
with
a
strong
side
wind
indeed
you
can
sail
safely
but
this
must
come
from
north
or
south
and
the
high
banks
vastly
reduce
its
effect
with
just
a
little
persuasion
the
railway
people
consented
to
put
the
canoe
in
the
and
to
charge
a
franc
or
two
for
extra
luggage
to
brussels
here
she
was
carried
on
a
cart
through
the
town
to
another
station
and
in
the
evening
we
were
at
namur
where
the
rob
roy
was
housed
for
the
night
in
the
landlord
private
parlour
resting
gracefully
upon
two
chairs
two
porters
carried
her
through
the
streets
next
morning
and
i
took
a
paddle
on
the
sambre
but
very
soon
turned
down
stream
and
smoothly
glided
to
the
meuse
glancing
water
brilliant
sun
a
light
boat
and
a
light
heart
all
your
baggage
on
board
and
on
a
fast
current
who
would
exchange
this
for
any
diligence
or
railway
or
steamboat
or
horse
a
pleasant
stream
was
enough
to
satisfy
at
this
early
period
of
the
voyage
for
the
excitement
of
rocks
and
rapids
had
not
yet
become
a
charm
it
is
good
policy
too
that
a
quiet
easy
respectable
sort
of
river
like
the
meuse
should
be
taken
in
the
earlier
stage
of
a
water
tour
when
there
is
novelty
enough
in
being
on
a
river
at
all
the
one
would
call
tame
if
seen
from
shore
are
altogether
new
when
you
open
up
the
vista
from
the
middle
of
the
stream
the
picture
that
is
rolled
sideways
to
the
common
traveller
now
pours
out
from
before
you
ever
enlarging
from
a
centre
and
in
the
gentle
sway
of
the
stream
the
landscape
seems
to
swell
on
this
side
and
on
that
with
new
things
ever
advancing
to
meet
you
in
succession
how
careful
i
was
at
the
first
shallow
getting
out
and
wading
as
i
lowered
the
boat
a
month
afterwards
i
would
dash
over
them
with
a
shove
here
and
a
stroke
there
in
answer
to
a
hoarse
croak
of
the
stones
at
the
bottom
grinding
against
my
keel
and
the
first
barrier
how
anxious
it
made
me
to
think
by
what
means
shall
i
get
over
a
man
appeared
just
in
time
they
do
and
twopence
made
him
happy
for
his
share
of
carrying
the
boat
round
by
land
and
i
jumped
in
again
as
before
sailing
was
easy
too
in
a
fine
wide
river
strong
and
deep
and
with
a
favouring
breeze
and
when
the
little
steamer
passed
i
drew
alongside
and
got
my
penny
roll
and
penny
glass
of
beer
while
the
wondering
passengers
the
first
of
many
amazed
foreigners
smiled
chattered
and
then
looked
grave
for
was
it
not
indecorous
to
laugh
at
an
englishman
evidently
mad
poor
fellow
the
voyage
was
chequered
by
innumerable
little
events
all
perfectly
different
from
those
one
meets
on
shore
and
when
i
came
to
the
forts
at
huy
and
knew
the
first
day
work
was
done
the
persuasion
was
complete
that
quite
a
new
order
of
sensations
had
been
set
going
next
morning
i
found
the
boat
safe
in
the
and
the
sails
still
drying
on
the
where
we
had
left
them
but
the
ostler
and
all
his
folks
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
everybody
had
gone
to
join
the
long
funeral
procession
of
a
great
musician
who
lived
fifty
years
at
huy
though
we
never
heard
of
him
before
or
of
huy
either
yet
you
see
it
is
in
our
map
at
page
the
pleasure
of
meandering
with
a
new
river
is
very
peculiar
and
fascinating
each
few
yards
brings
a
novelty
or
starts
an
excitement
a
crane
jumps
up
here
a
duck
flutters
there
splash
leaps
a
gleaming
trout
by
your
side
the
rushing
sound
of
rocks
warns
you
round
that
corner
or
anon
you
come
suddenly
upon
a
millrace
all
these
in
addition
to
the
scenery
and
the
people
and
the
weather
and
the
determination
that
you
get
on
over
through
or
under
every
difficulty
and
can
not
leave
your
boat
in
a
desolate
wold
and
ought
to
arrive
at
a
house
before
dark
and
that
your
luncheon
bag
is
long
since
empty
all
these
i
say
keep
the
mind
awake
which
would
perchance
dose
away
for
miles
in
a
carriage
it
is
as
in
the
voyage
of
life
that
our
cares
and
hardships
are
our
very
mentors
of
living
our
minds
would
only
vegetate
if
all
life
were
like
a
straight
canal
and
we
in
a
boat
being
towed
along
it
the
afflictions
that
agitate
the
soul
are
as
its
shallows
rocks
and
whirlpools
and
the
bark
that
has
not
been
tossed
on
billows
knows
not
half
the
sweetness
of
the
harbour
of
rest
the
river
soon
got
fast
and
lively
and
hour
after
hour
of
vigorous
work
prepared
me
well
for
breakfast
trees
seemed
to
spring
up
in
front
and
grow
tall
but
it
was
only
because
i
came
rapidly
towards
them
pleasant
villages
floated
as
it
were
to
meet
me
gently
moving
all
life
got
to
be
a
smooth
and
gliding
thing
of
dreamy
pictures
and
sounds
without
fuss
and
without
dust
or
anything
sudden
or
loud
till
at
length
the
bustle
and
hammers
of
liege
neared
the
rob
roy
for
it
was
always
the
objects
and
not
myself
that
seemed
to
move
here
i
saw
a
fast
steamer
the
seraing
propelled
by
water
forced
from
its
sides
and
as
my
boat
hopped
and
bobbed
in
the
steamer
waves
we
entered
a
dock
together
and
the
canoe
was
soon
hoisted
into
a
garden
for
the
night
are
the
rage
in
liege
everybody
there
makes
or
carries
or
sells
even
women
walk
about
with
twenty
stocked
rifles
on
their
backs
and
each
rifle
remember
weighs
lbs
they
sell
plenty
of
fruit
in
the
market
and
there
are
churches
well
worth
a
visit
here
but
after
all
are
the
prevailing
idea
of
the
place
however
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
describe
the
towns
seen
on
this
tour
i
had
seen
liege
well
years
before
and
indeed
almost
every
town
mentioned
in
these
pages
the
charm
then
of
the
voyage
was
not
in
going
to
strange
lands
but
in
seeing
old
places
in
a
new
way
here
at
length
the
earl
of
aberdeen
met
me
according
to
our
plans
arranged
long
before
he
had
got
a
canoe
built
for
the
trip
but
a
foot
longer
and
two
inches
narrower
than
the
rob
roy
and
moreover
made
of
fir
instead
of
strong
oak
it
was
sent
from
london
to
liege
and
the
combing
round
the
edge
of
the
deck
was
broken
in
the
journey
so
we
spent
some
hours
at
a
where
it
was
neatly
mended
launching
our
boats
unobserved
on
the
river
we
soon
left
liege
in
the
distance
and
braved
the
hot
sun
the
pleasant
companionship
of
two
travellers
each
quite
free
in
his
own
boat
was
very
enjoyable
sometimes
we
sailed
then
paddled
a
mile
or
two
or
joined
to
help
the
boats
over
a
weir
or
towed
them
along
while
we
walked
on
the
bank
for
a
iii
iii
frequent
trials
afterwards
convinced
me
that
towing
is
only
useful
if
you
feel
very
cramped
from
sitting
and
this
constraint
is
felt
less
and
less
as
you
get
accustomed
to
sit
ten
or
twelve
hours
at
a
time
experience
enables
you
to
make
the
seat
perfectly
comfortable
and
on
the
better
rivers
you
have
so
frequently
to
get
out
that
any
additional
change
is
quite
needless
towing
is
slower
progress
than
paddling
even
when
your
arms
are
tired
though
my
canoe
was
so
light
to
tow
that
for
miles
i
have
drawn
it
by
my
little
finger
on
a
canal
each
of
us
took
whichever
side
of
the
river
pleased
him
best
and
we
talked
across
long
acres
of
water
between
to
the
evident
surprise
of
sedate
people
on
the
banks
who
often
could
see
only
one
of
the
strange
elocutionists
the
other
being
hidden
by
bushes
or
tall
sedge
when
talking
thus
aloud
had
amplified
into
somewhat
uproarious
singing
the
chorus
was
far
more
energetic
than
harmonious
but
then
the
briton
is
at
once
the
most
timid
and
shy
of
mortal
travellers
and
the
most
and
singular
when
he
chooses
to
be
free
the
midday
beams
on
a
river
in
august
are
sure
to
conquer
your
fresh
energies
at
last
and
so
we
had
to
pull
up
at
a
village
for
bread
and
wine
the
moment
i
got
into
my
boat
again
a
shrill
whining
cry
in
the
river
attracted
my
attention
and
it
came
from
a
poor
little
boy
who
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
water
and
was
now
making
his
last
faint
efforts
to
cling
to
a
great
barge
in
the
stream
naturally
i
rushed
over
to
save
him
and
my
boat
went
so
fast
and
so
straight
that
its
sharp
prow
caught
the
hapless
urchin
in
the
rear
and
with
such
a
pointed
reminder
too
that
he
screamed
and
struggled
and
thus
got
safely
on
the
barge
which
was
beyond
his
reach
until
thus
roughly
but
fortunately
aided
on
most
of
the
belgian
german
and
french
rivers
there
are
excellent
floating
baths
an
obvious
convenience
which
i
do
not
recollect
observing
on
a
single
river
in
britain
though
in
summer
we
have
quite
as
many
bathers
as
there
are
abroad
the
floating
baths
consist
of
a
wooden
framework
say
feet
long
moored
in
the
stream
and
through
which
the
water
runs
freely
while
a
set
of
strong
bars
and
chains
and
iron
network
forms
a
false
bottom
shallow
at
one
end
and
deeper
at
the
other
so
that
the
bather
can
not
be
carried
away
by
the
current
round
the
sides
there
are
bathing
boxes
and
steps
ladders
and
spring
boards
for
the
various
degree
of
aquatic
proficiency
the
youths
and
even
the
little
boys
on
the
rhine
are
very
good
swimmers
and
many
of
them
dive
well
sometimes
there
is
a
ladies
bath
of
similar
construction
from
which
a
good
deal
of
very
lively
noise
may
be
heard
when
the
fair
bathers
are
in
a
talkative
mood
the
soldiers
at
military
stations
near
the
rivers
are
marched
down
regularly
to
bathe
and
one
day
we
found
a
large
number
of
young
recruits
assembled
for
their
general
dip
while
some
were
in
the
water
others
were
firing
at
the
targets
for
ball
practice
there
were
three
targets
each
made
of
cardboard
sheets
fastened
upon
wooden
uprights
a
marker
safely
protected
in
a
was
placed
so
close
to
these
targets
that
he
could
see
all
three
at
once
one
man
of
the
firing
party
opposite
each
target
having
fired
his
bullet
passed
through
the
pasteboard
and
left
a
clear
round
hole
in
it
while
the
ball
itself
was
buried
in
the
earth
behind
and
so
could
be
recovered
again
instead
of
being
dashed
into
fragments
as
on
our
iron
targets
and
then
spattered
about
on
all
sides
to
the
great
danger
of
the
marker
and
everybody
else
when
three
men
had
thus
fired
signals
were
made
by
drum
flag
and
bugle
and
the
firing
ceased
the
marker
then
came
out
and
pointed
to
the
on
each
target
and
having
patched
up
the
holes
he
returned
within
his
mantelet
and
the
firing
was
resumed
this
very
safe
and
simple
method
of
ball
practice
is
much
better
than
that
used
in
our
military
shooting
once
as
we
rounded
a
point
there
was
a
large
herd
of
cattle
swimming
across
the
stream
in
close
column
and
i
went
right
into
the
middle
of
them
to
observe
how
they
would
welcome
a
stranger
in
the
nile
you
see
the
black
oxen
swim
over
the
stream
night
and
morning
reminding
you
of
pharaoh
dream
about
the
kine
coming
up
out
of
the
river
a
notion
that
used
to
puzzle
in
boyhood
days
but
which
is
by
no
means
incongruous
when
thus
explained
the
bible
is
a
book
that
bears
full
light
to
be
cast
upon
it
for
truth
looks
more
true
under
more
light
we
had
been
delayed
this
morning
in
our
start
and
so
the
evening
fell
sombre
ere
we
came
near
the
this
was
the
town
of
maastricht
in
holland
and
it
is
stated
to
be
one
of
the
most
strongly
fortified
places
in
europe
that
is
of
the
old
fashion
with
straight
high
walls
quite
impervious
to
the
armstrong
and
whitworth
guns
of
a
century
gone
by
illustration
cattle
swimming
the
meuse
page
but
all
we
knew
as
we
came
near
it
at
night
was
that
the
stream
was
good
and
strong
and
that
no
lights
appeared
emerging
from
trees
we
were
right
in
the
middle
of
the
town
but
where
were
the
houses
had
they
no
windows
no
lamps
not
even
a
candle
two
great
high
walls
bounded
the
river
but
not
a
gate
or
port
could
we
find
though
one
of
us
carefully
scanned
the
right
and
the
other
cautiously
scraped
along
the
left
of
this
very
strange
place
it
appears
that
the
commerce
and
boats
all
turn
into
a
canal
above
the
old
fortress
and
so
the
blank
brick
sides
bounded
us
thus
inhospitably
soon
we
came
to
a
bridge
looming
overhead
in
the
blackness
and
our
arrival
there
was
greeted
by
a
shower
of
stones
from
some
dutch
lads
upon
it
pattering
pitilessly
upon
the
delicate
canoes
turning
up
stream
and
after
a
closer
scrutiny
we
found
a
place
where
we
could
cling
to
the
wall
which
here
sloped
a
little
with
debris
and
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
haul
the
boats
up
bodily
over
the
impregnable
fortification
and
thus
carry
them
into
the
sleepy
town
no
wonder
the
guard
stared
as
his
lamplight
fell
on
two
gaunt
men
in
grey
carrying
what
seemed
to
him
a
pair
of
long
coffins
but
he
was
a
sensible
though
surprised
individual
and
he
guided
us
well
stamping
through
the
dark
deserted
streets
to
an
hotel
though
the
canoes
in
a
cart
made
a
decided
impression
at
the
next
day
and
arguments
logically
proved
that
the
boats
must
go
as
baggage
the
porters
were
dense
to
conviction
and
obdurate
to
persuasion
until
all
at
once
a
sudden
change
took
place
they
rushed
at
us
caught
up
the
two
neglected
batteaux
ran
with
them
to
the
pushed
them
in
and
banged
the
door
piped
the
whistle
and
as
the
train
went
off
do
you
know
why
they
have
yielded
so
suddenly
said
a
dutchman
who
could
speak
english
not
at
all
said
we
because
i
told
them
one
of
you
was
the
son
of
the
prime
minister
and
the
other
lord
russell
son
but
a
change
of
railway
had
to
be
made
at
and
after
a
hard
struggle
we
had
nearly
surrendered
the
boats
to
the
merchandise
train
to
limp
along
the
line
at
night
and
to
arrive
perhaps
indeed
the
superintendent
of
that
department
seemed
to
clutch
the
boats
as
his
prize
but
as
he
gloried
a
little
too
loudly
the
chef
of
the
passengers
baggage
came
listened
and
with
calm
mien
ordered
for
us
a
special
covered
truck
and
on
arriving
at
cologne
there
was
nothing
to
iv
iv
this
is
an
exceptional
case
and
i
wrote
from
england
to
thank
the
officer
it
would
be
unreasonable
again
to
expect
any
baggage
to
be
thus
favoured
a
canoe
is
at
best
a
clumsy
inconvenience
in
the
and
no
one
can
wonder
that
it
is
objected
to
in
france
the
railway
are
shorter
than
in
other
countries
and
the
officials
there
insisted
on
treating
my
canoe
as
merchandise
the
instances
given
above
show
what
occurred
in
belgium
and
holland
in
germany
little
difficulty
was
made
about
the
boat
as
luggage
in
switzerland
there
was
no
objection
raised
for
was
not
i
an
english
traveller
as
for
the
english
railway
guards
they
have
the
good
sense
to
see
that
a
long
light
article
like
a
canoe
can
be
readily
carried
on
the
top
of
a
passenger
carriage
probably
some
distinct
rules
will
be
instituted
by
the
railways
in
each
country
when
they
are
found
to
be
liable
to
a
nautical
incursion
but
after
all
one
can
very
well
arrange
to
walk
or
see
sights
now
and
then
while
the
boat
travels
slower
by
a
to
be
quiet
we
went
to
the
belle
vue
at
deutz
which
is
opposite
cologne
but
a
great
singing
society
had
its
gala
there
and
sang
and
drank
prodigiously
next
day
sunday
too
this
same
quiet
deutz
had
a
schutzen
fest
where
the
man
who
had
hit
the
target
best
was
dragged
about
in
an
open
carriage
with
his
wife
both
wearing
brass
crowns
and
bowing
royally
to
a
screaming
crowd
while
blue
lights
glared
and
rockets
shot
up
in
the
serene
darkness
at
cologne
while
lord
went
to
take
our
tickets
at
the
steamer
the
boats
were
put
in
a
handcart
which
i
shoved
from
behind
as
a
man
pulled
it
in
front
in
our
way
to
the
river
i
was
assailed
by
a
poor
vagrant
sort
of
fellow
who
insisted
on
being
employed
as
a
porter
and
being
enraged
at
a
refusal
he
actually
took
up
a
large
stone
and
ran
after
the
cart
in
a
threatening
passion
i
could
not
take
my
hands
from
the
boats
though
in
fear
that
his
missile
would
smash
them
if
he
threw
it
but
i
kicked
up
my
legs
behind
as
we
trotted
along
one
of
the
sentries
saw
the
man
conduct
and
soon
a
policeman
brought
him
to
me
as
a
prisoner
but
as
he
trembled
now
with
fear
more
than
before
with
anger
i
declined
to
make
any
charge
though
the
police
pressed
this
course
saying
travellers
are
sacred
here
this
incident
is
mentioned
because
it
was
the
sole
occasion
when
any
discourtesy
happened
to
me
during
this
tour
we
took
the
canoes
by
steamer
to
a
wide
part
of
the
rhine
at
bingen
here
the
scenery
is
good
and
we
spent
an
active
day
on
the
river
sailing
in
a
splendid
breeze
landing
on
islands
scudding
about
in
steamers
waves
and
in
fact
enjoying
a
combination
of
yacht
voyage
and
boat
race
this
was
a
fine
long
day
of
pleasure
though
in
one
of
the
sudden
squalls
my
canoe
happened
to
ground
on
a
bank
just
at
the
most
critical
time
and
the
bamboo
mast
broke
short
the
uncouth
and
ridiculous
appearance
of
a
sail
falling
overboard
is
like
that
of
an
umbrella
turned
inside
out
in
a
gust
of
wind
but
i
got
another
stronger
mast
and
made
the
broken
one
into
a
boom
lord
aberdeen
went
by
train
to
inspect
the
river
nahe
but
reported
unfavourably
and
i
paddled
up
from
its
mouth
but
the
water
was
very
low
few
arguments
were
needed
to
stop
me
from
going
against
stream
for
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
the
universal
principle
of
gravitation
and
quite
allow
that
in
rowing
it
is
well
to
have
it
with
you
by
always
going
down
stream
and
so
the
good
rule
was
to
make
steam
horse
or
man
take
the
canoe
against
the
current
and
to
let
gravity
help
the
boat
to
carry
me
down
time
pressed
for
my
to
return
to
england
so
we
went
on
to
mayence
and
thence
by
rail
to
asschaffenburg
on
the
main
the
canoes
again
travelled
in
grand
state
having
a
truck
to
themselves
but
instead
of
the
stately
philosopher
superintendent
of
who
managed
this
gratuitously
we
had
a
fussy
little
person
to
deal
with
and
to
pay
accordingly
the
only
case
of
decided
cheating
i
can
recollect
during
the
voyage
a
in
the
railway
was
deeply
interested
about
our
tour
and
we
had
spoken
of
its
various
details
for
some
time
to
him
before
we
found
that
he
supposed
we
were
travelling
with
two
small
cannons
mistaking
the
word
canôts
for
canons
he
had
even
asked
about
their
length
and
weight
and
had
heard
with
perfect
placidity
that
our
canons
were
fifteen
feet
long
and
weighed
eighty
pounds
and
that
we
took
them
only
for
plaisir
not
to
sell
had
we
carried
two
pet
cameleopards
he
probably
would
not
have
been
astonished
the
guests
at
the
german
inn
of
this
town
amused
us
much
by
their
respectful
curiosity
our
dress
in
perfect
unison
both
alike
in
grey
flannel
puzzled
them
exceedingly
but
this
sort
of
perplexity
about
costume
and
whence
why
and
whither
was
an
everyday
occurrence
for
months
afterwards
with
me
a
fine
breeze
enabled
us
to
start
on
the
river
main
under
sail
though
we
lost
much
time
in
forcing
the
boats
to
do
yachts
work
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
sailing
on
rivers
is
rather
a
mistake
unless
with
a
favourable
wind
the
main
is
an
easy
stream
to
follow
and
the
scenery
only
a
storm
of
rain
at
length
made
it
so
we
sheltered
ourselves
in
a
bleak
sort
of
arbour
attached
to
an
inn
where
they
could
give
us
only
sour
black
bread
and
raw
bacon
eating
this
poor
cheer
in
a
wet
rustling
breeze
and
pattering
rain
in
our
macintoshes
was
the
only
time
i
fared
badly
so
little
of
roughing
it
was
there
in
this
luxurious
tour
fine
weather
came
soon
again
and
pleasure
nay
positive
sporting
for
there
were
wild
ducks
quite
impudent
in
their
familiarity
and
herons
wading
about
with
that
look
of
injured
innocence
they
put
on
when
you
dare
to
disturb
them
so
my
friend
capped
his
and
i
acted
as
a
pointer
dog
stealing
along
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
indicating
the
position
of
the
game
with
my
paddle
vast
trouble
was
taken
lord
went
ashore
and
crawled
on
the
bank
a
long
way
to
a
wily
bird
but
though
the
sportsman
had
shown
himself
at
wimbledon
to
be
one
of
the
best
shots
in
the
world
it
was
evidently
not
easy
to
shoot
a
heron
with
a
pocket
revolver
as
the
darker
shades
fell
even
this
rather
stupid
river
became
beautiful
and
our
evening
bath
was
in
a
quiet
pool
with
pure
yellow
sand
to
rest
on
if
you
tired
in
swimming
at
hanau
we
stopped
for
the
night
the
wanderings
and
turnings
of
the
main
next
day
have
really
left
no
impression
on
my
memory
except
that
we
had
a
pleasant
time
and
at
last
came
to
a
large
schloss
where
we
observed
on
the
river
a
boat
evidently
english
while
we
examined
this
craft
a
man
told
us
it
belonged
to
the
prince
of
wales
and
he
is
looking
at
you
now
from
the
balcony
for
this
was
the
duchess
of
cambridge
schloss
at
rumpenheim
and
presently
a
crossed
the
ferry
and
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
drove
in
it
by
the
while
we
plied
a
vigorous
paddle
against
the
powerful
west
wind
until
we
reached
frankfort
where
our
wet
jackets
were
soon
dried
at
the
one
of
the
best
hotels
in
europe
the
frankfort
boatmen
were
much
interested
next
day
to
see
the
two
english
canoes
flitting
about
so
lightly
on
their
river
sometimes
skimming
the
surface
with
the
wind
and
despising
the
contrary
stream
then
wheeling
about
and
paddling
hither
and
thither
in
shallows
where
it
seemed
as
if
the
banks
were
only
moist
on
one
occasion
we
both
got
into
my
canoe
and
it
supported
the
additional
weight
perfectly
well
which
seemed
to
prove
that
the
dimensions
of
it
were
unnecessarily
large
for
the
displacement
required
however
there
was
not
room
for
both
of
us
to
use
our
paddles
comfortably
in
the
same
canoe
on
the
sunday
the
royal
personages
came
to
the
english
church
at
frankfort
and
with
that
quiet
behaviour
of
good
taste
which
wins
more
admiration
that
any
pageantry
they
walked
from
the
place
of
worship
like
the
rest
of
the
hearers
there
is
a
true
grandeur
in
simplicity
when
the
occasion
is
one
of
solemn
things
next
day
my
active
and
pleasant
companion
had
to
leave
me
on
his
return
to
england
not
satisfied
with
a
fortnight
rifle
practice
at
wimbledon
where
the
best
prize
of
the
year
was
won
by
his
skill
he
must
return
to
the
moors
and
coverts
for
more
deadly
sport
and
the
calls
of
more
important
business
besides
required
his
presence
at
home
he
paddled
down
the
rhine
to
cologne
and
on
the
way
several
times
performed
the
difficult
feat
of
hooking
on
his
canoe
to
a
steamer
going
at
full
speed
meantime
my
boat
went
along
with
me
by
railway
to
freyburg
from
whence
the
new
voyage
was
really
to
begin
for
as
yet
the
rob
roy
had
not
paddled

planning
your
summer
tour
is
one
of
the
most
agreeable
of
occupations
it
is
in
june
or
july
that
the
foreign
bradshaw
becomes
suddenly
of
intense
interest
and
the
pages
of
steamers
and
railways
why
it
is
worth
while
being
a
bachelor
to
be
able
to
read
each
of
these
as
part
of
your
plan
and
oh
selfish
thought
to
have
only
one
mind
to
consult
as
to
whither
away
all
this
pleasure
is
a
good
deal
influenced
however
by
true
answers
to
these
questions
have
you
worked
hard
in
working
time
so
as
to
be
entitled
to
play
in
these
playhours
is
this
to
be
a
vacation
of
refreshment
or
an
idle
lounge
and
killing
of
time
are
you
going
off
to
rest
and
to
recruit
delicate
health
or
with
vigour
to
enjoy
a
summer
of
active
exertion
but
now
the
infallible
bradshaw
could
not
help
me
with
the
canoe
one
iota
and
baedeker
was
not
written
for
a
boat
so
at
freyburg
my
plans
resolved
themselves
into
the
simple
direction
go
at
once
to
the
source
of
the
danube
next
morning
therefore
found
the
rob
roy
in
a
cart
and
the
traveller
walking
beside
it
on
the
dusty
höllenthal
road
the
gay
exultation
of
being
strong
and
well
and
on
a
right
errand
and
with
unknown
things
to
do
and
places
to
see
and
people
to
meet
who
can
describe
this
how
easy
it
is
at
such
times
to
be
glad
and
to
think
this
is
being
thankful
after
moralizing
for
a
few
miles
a
carriage
full
of
english
people
overtook
me
and
soon
we
became
companions
the
english
are
so
distant
so
silent
such
and
gloomy
distrust
forsooth
a
false
verdict
say
i
the
ladies
carried
me
off
through
the
very
pretty
glen
and
the
canoe
on
its
cart
trundled
slowly
after
us
behind
through
the
höllenthal
pass
which
is
too
seldom
visited
by
travellers
who
so
often
admire
the
spire
of
freyburg
from
the
railway
perhaps
passing
it
on
their
route
to
switzerland
this
entrance
to
the
schwartzwald
or
black
forest
is
a
woody
rocky
and
grim
defile
with
an
excellent
road
and
good
inns
the
villages
are
of
wood
and
there
is
a
in
every
other
house
giving
a
busy
wholesome
sound
mellowed
by
the
patter
of
the
further
on
where
tourists
scenery
stops
it
is
a
grand
ocean
of
hills
the
houses
get
larger
and
larger
and
fewer
and
fewer
and
nearly
every
one
has
a
little
chapel
built
alongside
with
a
wooden
saint
image
of
nailed
on
the
gable
end
one
night
i
was
in
one
of
these
huge
domiciles
when
all
the
servants
and
ploughboys
came
in
and
half
said
half
sung
their
prayers
in
a
whining
but
yet
musical
tone
and
then
retired
for
a
hearty
supper
our
carriage
mounted
still
among
crags
that
bowed
from
each
side
to
meet
across
the
narrow
gorge
and
were
crested
on
high
by
the
grand
trees
that
will
be
felled
and
floated
down
the
rhine
on
one
of
those
huge
rafts
you
meet
at
strasbourg
but
everybody
must
have
seen
a
rhine
raft
so
i
need
not
describe
it
with
its
acres
of
wood
and
its
street
of
cabin
dwellings
and
its
gay
bannerets
a
large
raft
needs
men
to
navigate
it
and
the
timber
will
sell
for
at
the
top
of
this
pass
was
the
watershed
of
this
first
chain
of
hills
where
my
english
friends
took
leave
of
me
the
rob
roy
was
safely
housed
in
the
baar
inn
and
i
set
off
for
a
long
walk
to
find
if
the
tiny
stream
there
would
possibly
be
navigable
alone
on
a
hillside
in
a
foreign
land
and
with
an
evening
sun
on
the
wild
mountains
the
playful
breeze
and
the
bleating
sheep
around
you
there
is
a
certain
sense
of
independent
delight
that
possesses
the
mind
then
with
a
buoyant
gladness
but
how
can
i
explain
it
in
words
unless
you
have
felt
this
sort
of
pleasure
however
the
rivulet
was
found
to
be
eminently
unsuited
for
a
canoe
so
now
let
me
go
to
bed
in
my
wooden
room
where
the
washingbasin
is
oval
and
the
partitions
are
so
thin
that
one
hears
all
the
noises
of
the
place
at
midnight
now
the
snore
of
the
landlord
then
the
of
the
servants
not
asleep
yet
a
pussy
plaintive
mew
and
the
scraping
of
a
mouse
the
cows
breathing
in
soft
slumber
and
again
the
sharp
rattle
of
a
horse
chain
the
elaborate
construction
of
that
edifice
of
housewifery
called
a
bett
here
and
which
we
are
expected
to
sleep
upon
can
only
be
understood
when
you
have
to
undermine
and
dismantle
it
night
after
night
to
arrive
at
a
reasonable
flat
surface
on
which
to
recline
first
you
take
off
a
great
fluff
bag
at
least
two
feet
thick
then
a
counterpane
and
then
a
brilliant
scarlet
blanket
next
you
extract
one
enormous
pillow
another
enormous
pillow
and
a
huge
bolster
all
it
appears
requisite
for
the
teutonic
race
who
yet
could
surely
put
themselves
to
sleep
at
an
angle
of
degrees
without
all
this
trouble
by
merely
tilting
up
the
end
of
a
flat
bedstead
simple
but
real
courtesy
have
i
found
throughout
every
one
says
gut
tag
and
even
in
a
hotel
on
getting
up
from
breakfast
a
guest
who
has
not
spoken
a
word
will
wish
gut
morgen
as
he
departs
and
perhaps
bon
appetit
to
those
not
satisfied
like
himself
about
eight
the
light
repast
of
tea
or
coffee
bread
butter
and
honey
begins
the
day
at
noon
is
mittagessen
the
meal
leaving
all
proper
excuse
for
another
dining
operation
in
the
shape
of
a
supper
at
seven
no
fine
manners
here
my
driver
sat
down
to
dinner
with
me
and
the
waiter
along
with
him
smoking
a
cigar
between
whiles
as
he
waited
on
us
both
but
all
this
is
just
as
one
sees
in
canada
and
in
norway
and
wherever
there
are
mountains
woods
and
torrent
streams
with
a
sparse
population
and
as
in
norway
too
you
see
at
once
that
all
can
read
and
they
do
read
there
is
more
reading
in
one
day
in
a
common
house
in
germany
than
in
a
month
in
the
same
sort
of
place
in
france
i
had
hired
the
cart
and
driver
by
the
day
but
he
by
no
means
admired
my
first
directions
next
morning
namely
to
take
the
boat
off
the
main
road
so
as
to
get
to
the
titisee
a
pretty
mountain
lake
about
four
miles
long
and
surrounded
by
wooded
knolls
his
arguments
and
objections
were
evidently
superficial
and
something
deeper
than
he
said
was
in
his
mind
in
fact
it
appears
that
by
a
superstition
long
cherished
there
pontius
pilate
is
supposed
to
be
in
that
deep
still
lake
and
dark
rumours
were
told
that
he
would
surely
drag
me
down
if
i
ventured
upon
v
the
legend
about
pilate
extends
over
germany
and
italy
even
on
the
flanks
of
stromboli
there
is
a
of
the
volcano
which
the
people
dare
not
approach
because
of
pontius
pilate
of
course
this
decided
the
matter
and
when
i
launched
the
rob
roy
from
the
pebbly
shore
in
a
fine
foggy
morning
and
in
full
view
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
eight
in
number
at
last
census
we
had
a
most
pleasant
paddle
for
several
miles
at
a
distance
the
boat
was
invisible
being
so
low
in
the
water
and
they
said
that
only
a
man
was
seen
whirling
a
paddle
about
his
head
there
is
nothing
interesting
about
this
lake
except
that
it
is
feet
above
the
sea
and
very
lonely
in
the
middle
of
the
black
forest
certainly
no
english
boat
has
been
there
before
and
probably
no
other
will
visit
the
deserted
water
after
this
the
rob
roy
is
carted
again
still
further
into
the
forests
lumbering
vehicles
meet
us
all
carrying
wood
some
have
joined
three
carts
together
and
have
eight
horses
others
have
a
bullock
or
two
besides
and
all
the
men
are
intelligent
enough
for
they
stop
and
stare
and
my
driver
deigns
to
tell
them
in
a
patois
wholly
beyond
me
as
to
what
a
strange
fare
he
has
got
with
a
boat
and
no
other
luggage
however
they
invariably
conclude
that
the
canoe
is
being
carried
about
for
sale
and
it
could
have
been
well
sold
frequently
already
about
my
sage
driver
began
to
mutter
something
at
intervals
but
i
could
only
make
out
from
his
gestures
and
glances
that
it
had
to
do
with
a
storm
overhead
the
mixture
of
english
french
and
german
on
the
borders
of
the
rhine
accustoms
one
to
hear
odd
words
shall
have
you
pottyto
says
a
waiter
and
he
is
asking
if
you
will
have
potatoes
another
hands
you
a
dish
saying
it
is
sweetbone
and
you
must
know
it
is
sweetbread
yes
the
storm
came
and
as
it
seldom
does
come
except
in
such
places
i
once
heard
a
thunder
peal
while
standing
on
the
crater
of
mount
vesuvius
and
i
have
seen
the
bright
lightning
in
cold
and
grand
beauty
playing
on
the
falls
of
niagara
in
a
sombre
night
but
the
vividness
of
the
flashes
in
the
black
forest
and
the
crashing
rolling
and
booming
of
the
terrible
and
majestic
battery
of
heaven
was
astounding
once
a
bolt
fell
so
near
and
with
such
a
blaze
that
the
horse
albeit
tired
enough
started
off
down
a
hill
and
made
me
quite
nervous
lest
he
should
overturn
the
cart
and
injure
my
precious
boat
which
naturally
was
more
and
more
dear
to
me
as
it
was
longer
my
sole
companion
as
we
toiled
up
the
rothenhaus
pass
down
came
the
rain
whistling
and
rushing
through
the
cold
dark
forests
of
larch
and
blackening
the
top
of
great
feldberg
the
highest
mountain
here
and
then
pouring
heavy
and
fast
on
the
cart
and
horse
the
man
the
canoe
and
myself
this
was
the
last
rain
my
boat
got
in
the
tour
all
other
days
i
spent
in
her
were
perfectly
dry
people
stared
out
of
their
windows
to
see
a
cart
and
a
boat
in
this
heavy
shower
what
a
boat
up
here
in
the
hills
where
can
it
be
going
and
whose
is
it
then
they
ran
out
to
us
and
forced
the
driver
to
harangue
and
he
tried
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
but
his
explanation
never
seemed
to
be
quite
exhaustive
for
they
turned
homeward
shaking
their
heads
and
looking
grave
even
though
i
nodded
and
laughed
at
them
through
the
bars
of
the
cart
lifting
up
my
head
among
the
wet
straw
the
weather
dried
up
its
tears
at
last
and
the
sun
glittered
on
the
road
still
sparkling
with
its
rivulets
of
rain
but
the
boat
was
soon
dried
by
a
sponge
while
a
smart
walk
warmed
its
captain
the
horse
too
had
got
into
a
cheerful
vein
and
actually
trotted
with
excitement
for
now
it
was
down
hill
and
bright
sun
a
welcome
change
in
ten
minutes
from
our
labouring
up
a
steep
forest
road
in
a
the
most
rigid
teetotaller
i
am
only
a
temperance
man
would
probably
allow
that
just
a
very
small
glass
of
kirchwasser
might
be
prescribed
at
this
moment
with
advantage
and
as
there
was
no
faculty
there
but
myself
i
administered
the
dose
medicinally
to
the
driver
and
to
his
employer
and
gave
a
and
a
rub
down
to
the
horse
which
made
all
three
of
us
better
satisfied
with
ourselves
and
each
other
and
so
we
jogged
on
again
by
dusk
i
marched
into
donaueschingen
and
on
crossing
the
little
bridge
saw
at
once
i
could
begin
the
danube
from
its
very
source
for
there
was
at
least
three
inches
of
water
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
in
five
minutes
a
crowd
assembled
round
the
boat
even
before
it
could
be
loosened
from
the
vi
vi
after
trying
various
modes
of
securing
the
canoe
in
a
springless
cart
for
long
journeys
on
rough
and
hilly
roads
i
am
convinced
that
the
best
way
is
to
fasten
two
ropes
across
the
top
of
a
long
cart
and
let
the
boat
lie
on
these
which
will
bear
it
like
springs
and
so
modify
the
jolts
the
painter
is
then
made
fast
fore
and
aft
so
as
to
keep
the
boat
from
moving
back
and
forward
all
plans
for
using
trusses
of
straw
fail
after
a
few
miles
of
rolling
gravel
and
coarse
ruts
the
ordinary
idlers
came
first
then
the
more
shy
townspeople
and
then
a
number
of
strange
folk
whose
exact
position
i
could
not
make
out
until
it
was
explained
that
the
great
singing
meeting
for
that
part
of
germany
was
to
be
held
next
day
in
the
town
and
so
there
were
visitors
all
men
of
some
means
and
intelligence
who
were
collected
from
a
wide
country
round
about
the
town
was
in
gala
for
this
meeting
of
song
the
inns
were
full
but
still
the
good
landlord
of
the
poste
by
the
bridge
gave
me
an
excellent
room
and
the
canoe
was
duly
borne
aloft
in
procession
to
the
coachhouse
what
a
din
these
tenors
and
basses
did
make
at
the
table
everything
about
the
boat
had
to
be
told
a
dozen
times
over
to
them
while
my
driver
had
a
separate
on
the
subject
below
the
town
was
well
worth
inspection
next
day
for
it
was
in
a
violent
fit
of
decoration
every
house
was
tidied
up
and
all
the
streets
were
swept
clean
from
the
humbler
windows
hung
green
boughs
and
garlands
rugs
quilts
and
blankets
while
banners
venetian
streamers
arches
mottoes
and
wreaths
of
flowers
announced
the
wealthier
houses
crowds
of
gaping
peasants
paraded
the
streets
and
jostled
against
bands
drumming
and
tromboning
if
there
be
such
a
word
and
marching
in
a
somewhat
ricketty
manner
over
the
undoubtedly
rough
pavement
every
now
and
then
the
bustle
had
a
fresh
paroxysm
when
four
horses
rattled
along
bringing
in
new
visitors
from
some
distant
choir
they
are
coming
you
see
in
a
long
cart
covered
with
evergreens
and
bearing
four
pine
trees
in
it
erect
among
sacks
which
are
used
as
seats
only
the
inmates
do
not
sit
but
stand
up
in
the
cart
and
shout
and
sing
and
wave
banners
aloft
while
the
hundreds
of
roar
out
the
hoch
the
german
hurrah
with
only
one
note
as
every
window
had
its
ornament
or
device
i
made
one
for
mine
also
and
my
sails
were
festooned
rather
tastefully
i
flatter
myself
to
support
the
little
blue
silk
english
jack
of
the
canoe
this
complimentary
display
was
speedily
recognized
by
the
germans
who
greeted
it
with
cheers
and
sung
glees
below
and
improvised
verses
about
england
and
then
sang
round
the
boat
itself
laughing
shouting
and
hurraing
boisterously
with
the
vigour
of
youthful
lungs
never
tell
me
again
that
the
germans
are
phlegmatic
illustration
singers
waggon
they
had
a
banket
in
the
evening
at
the
museum
it
was
free
for
all
and
so
came
on
these
cheap
terms
and
all
drank
beer
from
long
glass
cylinders
at
a
penny
a
glass
all
smoked
cigars
at
a
farthing
a
piece
and
all
talked
and
all
sang
though
a
splendid
brass
band
was
playing
beside
them
and
whenever
it
stopped
a
glee
or
chorus
commenced
the
whole
affair
was
a
scene
of
bewildering
excitement
very
curious
to
contemplate
for
one
sitting
in
the
midst
next
me
i
found
a
young
bookseller
who
had
sold
me
a
french
book
in
the
morning
he
said
i
must
take
a
ticket
for
the
sunday
concert
but
i
told
him
i
was
an
englishman
and
had
learned
in
my
country
that
it
was
god
will
and
for
man
good
to
keep
sunday
for
far
better
things
which
are
too
much
forgotten
when
one
day
in
seven
is
not
saved
from
the
business
excitement
and
giddiness
of
life
and
is
there
not
a
feeling
of
dull
sameness
about
time
in
those
countries
and
places
where
the
week
is
not
steadied
and
centred
round
a
solid
day
on
which
lofty
and
deep
things
pure
and
lasting
things
may
have
at
least
some
hours
of
our
attention
so
i
left
the
merry
singers
to
bang
their
drums
and
hoch
at
each
other
in
the
great
hall
provided
for
their
use
by
the
prince
of
furstemburg
he
had
reared
this
near
his
stables
in
which
are
many
good
horses
some
of
the
best
being
english
and
named
on
their
stalls
miss
pet
lady
or
tom
an
english
gentleman
whom
i
met
afterwards
had
been
travelling
through
germany
with
a
drag
and
he
came
to
donaueschingen
where
the
prince
soon
heard
of
his
arrival
next
day
his
serene
highness
was
at
his
stables
and
seeing
an
english
visitor
there
he
politely
conducted
the
stranger
over
the
whole
establishment
explaining
every
item
with
minute
care
he
found
out
afterwards
that
this
visitor
was
not
the
english
gentleman
but
only
his
groom
the
intelligence
activity
and
good
temper
of
most
of
the
german
waiters
in
hotels
will
surely
be
observed
by
travellers
whose
daily
enjoyment
depends
so
much
on
that
class
here
for
instance
is
a
little
waiter
at
the
poste
inn
he
is
the
size
of
a
boy
but
looks
twenty
years
older
his
face
is
flat
and
broad
and
brown
and
so
is
his
jacket
his
shoulders
are
high
and
he
reminds
you
of
those
four
everlasting
german
juveniles
with
thick
comforters
about
their
necks
who
stand
in
london
streets
blowing
brass
music
with
their
cheeks
puffed
out
and
their
cold
grey
eyes
turning
on
all
the
passing
objects
while
the
music
or
at
any
rate
a
noise
blurts
out
as
if
mechanically
from
the
big
unpolished
instruments
held
by
red
benumbed
fingers
this
waiter
lad
then
is
all
the
day
at
the
beck
of
all
and
never
gets
a
night
undisturbed
yet
he
is
as
obliging
at
ten
in
the
dark
as
for
the
early
coffee
at
sunrise
and
he
quite
agrees
with
each
guest
in
the
belief
that
particular
cutlet
or
cognac
is
the
most
important
feature
of
the
hour
i
honour
this
sort
of
man
he
fills
a
hard
place
well
and
bismarck
or
mussurus
can
not
do
more
then
again
there
is
ulric
the
other
waiter
hired
only
for
as
an
extra
to
meet
the
crush
of
hungry
vocalists
who
will
soon
fill
the
he
is
timid
yet
being
young
and
only
used
to
a
village
inn
where
the
poste
at
donaueschingen
is
looked
up
to
with
solemn
admiration
as
the
pink
of
fashion
he
was
learning
french
too
and
was
sentimental
so
i
gave
him
a
very
book
and
then
he
asked
me
to
let
him
sit
in
the
canoe
while
i
was
to
paddle
it
down
the
river
to
his
home
the
naïve
simplicity
of
this
request
was
truly
refreshing
and
if
we
had
been
sure
of
shallow
water
all
the
way
and
yet
not
too
shallow
it
would
perhaps
have
been
amusing
to
admit
such
a
passenger
the
actual
source
of
the
danube
is
by
no
means
agreed
upon
any
more
than
the
source
of
the
nile
i
had
a
day
exploration
of
the
country
after
seeking
exact
information
on
this
point
from
the
townspeople
in
vain
the
land
round
donaueschingen
is
a
spongy
soil
with
numerous
rivulets
and
a
few
large
streams
i
went
along
one
of
these
the
brege
which
rises
twenty
miles
away
near
martin
and
investigated
about
ten
miles
of
another
the
brigach
a
brook
rising
near
georgen
about
a
mile
from
the
source
of
the
neckar
which
river
runs
to
the
rhine
these
streams
join
near
donaueschingen
but
in
the
town
there
bubbles
up
a
clear
spring
of
water
in
the
gardens
of
the
prince
near
the
church
and
this
the
infant
danube
runs
into
the
other
water
already
wide
enough
for
a
boat
but
which
then
for
the
first
time
has
the
name
of
donau
the
name
it
is
said
is
never
given
to
either
of
the
two
larger
rivulets
because
sometimes
both
have
been
known
to
fail
in
dry
summers
while
the
bubbling
spring
has
been
perennial
for
ages
the
brege
and
another
confluent
are
caused
to
fill
an
artificial
pond
close
by
the
brigach
this
lake
is
wooded
round
and
has
a
pretty
island
and
swans
and
gold
fish
a
waterwheel
in
vain
covered
for
concealment
pumps
up
water
to
flow
from
an
inverted
horn
amid
a
group
of
statuary
in
this
romantic
pond
and
the
stream
flowing
from
it
also
joins
the
others
now

the
name
donau
is
pronounced

allied
to

a
river
in
celtic
means
river
and
means
brown

the
english
eyot
the
other
three
rivers
mentioned
above
and
depicted
in
the
plan
on
the
map
with
this
book
seem
to
preserve
traces
of
their
roman
names
thus
the
brigach
is
the
stream
coming
from
the
north
where
alt
breisach
now
represents
the

the
reader
being
now
sufficiently
confused
about
the
source
of
the
danube
and
its
name
let
us
leave
the
latin
in
the
quagmire
and
jump
nimbly
into
our
canoe
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
however
in
this
matter
about
the
various
rivulets
i
went
up
each
stream
until
it
would
not
float
a

from

the

excessively
at

shouted

with

whistling

and

there
begins
a
grand
panorama
of
river
beauties
to
be
unrolled
for
days
and
days
no
river
i
have
seen
equals
this
upper
danube
and
i
have
visited
many
pretty
streams
the
wood
is
so
thick
the
rocks
so
quaint
and
high
and
varied
the
water
so
clear
and
the
grass
so
green
winding
here
and
turning
there
and
rushing
fast
down
this
reach
and
paddling
slow
along
that
with
each
minute
a
fresh
view
and
of
new
things
the
mind
is
ever
on
the
or
the
boat
will
go
bump
on
a
bank
crash
on
a
rock
or
plunge
into
a
tree
full
of
gnats
and
spiders
this
is
veritable
travelling
where
skill
and
tact
are
needed
to
bear
you
along
and
where
each
exertion
of
either
is
rewarded
at
once
i
think
also
it
promotes
decision
of
character
for
you
choose
and
that
promptly
too
between
say
five
channels
opened
suddenly
before
you
three
are
probably
safe
but
which
of
these
three
is
the
shortest
deepest
and
most
practicable
in
an
instant
if
you
hesitate
the
boat
is
on
a
bank
and
it
is
remarkable
how
speedily
the
exercise
of
this
resolution
becomes
experienced
into
habit
but
of
course
only
after
some
severe
lessons
it
is
exciting
to
direct
a
camel
over
the
sandy
desert
when
you
have
lost
your
and
to
guide
a
horse
in
trackless
wilds
alone
but
the
pleasure
of
paddling
a
canoe
down
a
rapid
and
unknown
river
is
far
more
than
these
part
of
this
pleasure
flows
from
the
mere
sense
of
rapid
motion
in
going
down
a
swift
reach
of
the
river
there
is
the
same
sensation
about
one
diaphragm
which
is
felt
when
one
goes
forward
smoothly
on
a
lofty
rope
swing
now
the
first
few
days
of
the
danube
are
upon
very
fast
waters
between
its
source
and
ulm
the
descent
of
the
river
is
about
viii
this
would
give
feet
of
fall
for
each
of
a
five
days
journey
and
it
will
be
seen
from
this
that
the
prospect
for
the
day
voyage
is
most
cheering
when
you
launch
in
the
morning
and
know
you
will
have
to
descend
about
the
height
of
paul
cathedral
before
halting
for
the
night
viii
the
best
geographical
books
give
different
estimates
of
this
some
above
and
others
below
the
amount
here
stated
another
part
of
the
pleasure
it
is
not
to
be
denied
consists
in
the
satisfaction
of
overcoming
difficulties
when
you
have
followed
a
channel
chosen
from
several
and
after
of
it
you
see
one
and
another
of
the
rejected
channels
emerging
from
its
island
to
join
that
you
are
in
there
is
a
natural
pride
in
observing
that
any
other
streamlet
but
the
one
you
had
chosen
would
certainly
have
been
a
mistake
these
reflections
are
by
the
way
and
we
have
been
winding
the
while
through
a
rich
grassy
plain
till
a
bridge
over
the
river
made
it
seem
quite
a
civilized
spot
and
just
as
i
passed
under
there
drove
along
one
of
the
waggons
of
jovial
singers
returning
from
donaueschingen
of
course
they
recognised
the
canoe
and
stopped
to
give
her
a
hearty
cheer
ending
with
a
general
chorus

noisy
but
people
having
been
assembled
in
the
morning
when
the
canoe
had
started
from
the
source

the

caused
the
news
of
its
adventure
to
be
rapidly
carried
to
all
the
neighbouring
towns

that
the

was

my
engine
needed
some
fuel
or
in
plain
terms
i
must
breakfast
the
houses
of
the
town
were
not
close
to
the
river
but
some
workmen
were
near
at
hand
and
i
had
to
leave
the
canoe
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
moored
to
a
plank
with
very
strict
injunctions
in
most
distinct
english
to
an
intelligent
boy
to
take
charge
of
her
until
my
return
and
then
i
walked
to
the
principal
street
and
to
the
house
and
knocked
entered
asked
for
breakfast
and
sat
down
and
was
speedily
supplied
with
an
excellent
meal
one
after
another
the
people
came
in
to
look
at
the
queer
stranger
who
was
clad
so
oddly
and
had
come
aye
had
he
come
that
was
what
they
argued
about
in
whispers
till
he
paid
his
bill
and
then
they
followed
to
see
where
he
would
go
and
thus
was
there
always
a
congregation
of
inquisitive
but
respectful
observers
as
we
started
anew
off
again
though
the
august
sun
is
hot
but
we
can
not
stop
now
the
shade
will
be
better
enjoyed
when
resting
in
the
boat
under
a
high
rock
or
in
a
cool
water
cave
or
beneath
a
wooden
bridge
or
within
the
longer
shadow
of
a
cliff
often
i
tried
to
rest
those
midday
hours
for
one
can
not
always
work
on
shore
in
a
house
or
on
a
grassy
bank
but
it
was
never
so
pleasant
as
at
full
length
in
the
canoe
under
a
thick
grown
with
a
book
to
read
dreamily
and
a
mild
cigar
at
six
for
a
penny
grown
in
the
fields
we
passed
and
made
up

two
stimulants
well
known
in
england
are
much
used
in
germany
tea
and
tobacco
the
tobacco
plant
sometimes
styled
a
weed

it
also
grows
wild
produces
leaves
which
are
dried
and
rolled
and
then
treated
with
fire

appropriate
instrument
by
which
the
fumes
are
inhaled

effect
upon
many
persons
is
to
soothe
but
it
impairs
the
appetite
of
others

use
is

both
these
luxuries
are
cheap

are
daily
enjoyed
by
millions
of
persons
in
all
climates
both
require
care
and
moderation
in
their
use
both
have
advocates
and
enemies
and
it
can
not
be
settled
by
argument
whether
the
plant
or
the
weed
is
the
more
useful
or
hurtful
to
mankind
let
it
be
well
understood
that
this
picture
only
describes
the
resting
time
and
not
the
active
hours
of
progress
in
the
cooler
part
of
the
day
before
and
after
the
bright
meridian
sun
in
working
hours
there
was
no
lazy
lolling
the
enjoyment
was
that
of
delightful
exertion
varied
at
every
reach
of
the
river
you
start
indeed
quietly
enough
but
are
sure
soon
to
hear
the
rushing
sound
of
a
milldam
and
this
almost
every
day
five
or
six
times
on
coming
to
it
i
usually
went
straight
along
the
top
edge
of
the
weir
looking
over
for
a
good
place
to
descend
by
and
surveying
the
innumerable
little
streams
below
to
see
my
best
course
afterwards
by
this
time
the
miller
and
his
family
and
his
men
and
all
the
neighbours
would
run
down
to
see
the
new
sight
but
i
always
lifted
out
my
little
black
knapsack
and
put
my
paddle
on
shore
and
then
stepped
out
and
pulled
my
boat
over
or
round
the
obstruction
sometimes
through
a
hayfield
or
two
or
by
a
lane
or
along
a
wall
and
then
launched
her
again
in
deep
water
dams
less
than
four
feet
high
one
can
shoot
with
a
headlong
plunge
into
the
little
billows
at
the
foot
but
this
wrenches
the
boot
if
it
strikes
against
a
stone
and
it
is
better
to
get
out
and
ease
her
through
lift
her
over
or
drag
her
round
in
other
places
i
had
to
sit
astride
on
the
stern
of
the
canoe
with
both
legs
in
the
water
fending
her
off
from
big
stones
on
either
side
and
cautiously
xi
xi
the
invention
of
this
method
was
made
here
but
its
invaluable
advantages
were
more
apparent
in
passing
the
second
rapid
of
rheinfelden
see
page
where
described
with
a
sketch
but
with
these
amusements
and
a
little
wading
you
sit
quite
dry
and
leaning
against
the
backboard
smoothly
glide
past
every
danger
lolling
at
ease
where
the
current
is
excessive
and
where
it
would
not
be
safe
to
add
impetus
for
the
shock
of
a
collision
there
would
break
the
strongest
boat
if
incidents
like
these
and
the
scenery
and
the
people
ashore
were
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
ever
greedy
mind
some
louder
plashing
with
a
deeper
roar
would
announce
the
rapids
this
sound
was
sure
to
waken
up
any
sleepiness
and
once
in
the
middle
of
rough
water
all
had
to
be
energy
and
life
i
never
had
a
positive
upset
but
of
course
i
had
to
jump
out
frequently
to
save
the
boat
for
the
first
care
was
the
canoe
and
the
second
was
my
luggage
to
keep
it
all
dry
the
in
particular
while
the
third
object
was
to
get
on
comfortably
and
fast
after
hours
of
these
pleasures
of
work
and
rest
and
a
vast
deal
seen
and
heard
and
felt
that
would
take
too
long
to
tell
the
waning
sun
and
the
cravings
within
for
dinner
warned
me
truly
that
i
had
come
near
the
for
the
night
the
town
of
tuttlingen
is
built
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
almost
every
house
is
a
dyer
shop
or
a
tannery
with
men
beating
scraping
and
washing
hides
in
the
water
as
i
allowed
the
boat
to
drift
among
these
the
boys
soon
found
her
out
a
new
object
and
therefore
to
boys
and
may
it
always
be
so
well
worth
a
shout
and
a
run
so
a
whole
posse
of
little
germans
scampered
along
beside
me
but
i
could
not
see
any
inn
it
is
one
of
the
privileges
of
this
water
tour
that
you
can
survey
calmly
all
the
whereabouts
and
being
out
of
reach
of
the
touters
and
porters
who
harass
the
wretched
traveller
delivered
to
their
grasp
from
an
omnibus
or
a
steamboat
you
can
philosophize
on
the
whole
of
a
town
and
if
so
inclined
can
pass
it
and
simply
go
on
in
fact
on
several
occasions
i
did
not
fancy
a
town
so
we
went
on
to
another
however
i
was
fairly
nonplussed
now
it
would
not
do
to
go
further
for
it
was
not
a
country
but
i
went
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
place
in
search
of
a
good
landing
till
i
turned
into
a
millrace
and
stepped
ashore
the
crowd
pressed
so
closely
that
i
had
to
fix
on
a
boy
who
had
a
toy
barrow
with
four
little
wheels
and
amid
much
laughter
i
persuaded
the
boy
to
lend
it
of
course
as
a
great
honour
to
him
and
so
i
pulled
the
boat
on
this
to
the
hotel
the
boy
sixpence
of
reward
was
a
fact
that
brought
all
the
juvenile
population
together
and
though
we
hoisted
the
canoe
into
a
hayloft
and
gave
very
positive
injunction
to
the
ostler
to
keep
her
safe
there
was
soon
a
string
of
older
sightseers
admitted
one
by
one
and
even
at
night
they
were
mounting
the
ladder
with
lanterns
women
as
well
as
men
to
examine
the
schiff
a
total
change
of
garments
usually
enabled
me
to
stroll
through
the
villages
in
the
evening
without
being
recognised
but
here
i
was
instantly
known
as
i
emerged
for
a
walk
and
it
was
evident
that
an
unusual
attendance
must
be
expected
in
the
morning
tuttlingen
is
a
very
curious
old
town
with
a
good
inn
and
bad
pavement
tall
houses
all
leaning
here
and
there
and
big
clumsy
men
lounging
after
their
work
and
wonderfully
satisfied
to
chat
in
groups
amid
the
signal
darkness
of
unlighted
streets
very
fat
horses
and
women
a
bridge
and
numerous
schoolboys
these
are
my
impressions
of
tuttlingen
illustration
morning
visitors
page
even
at
six
next
morning
these
boys
had
begun
to
assemble
for
the
sight
they
expected
and
those
of
them
who
had
satchels
on
their
backs
seemed
grievously
disappointed
to
find
the
start
would
not
come
off
before
their
hour
for
early
school
however
the
people
came
instead
and
flocked
to
the
bridge
and
its
approaches
while
i
was
endeavouring
to
answer
all
the
usual
questions
as
to
the
boat
a
man
respectfully
asked
me
to
delay
the
start
five
minutes
as
his
aged
father
who
was
bedridden
wished
exceedingly
just
to
see
the
canoe
in
all
such
cases
it
is
a
pleasure
to
give
pleasure
and
to
sympathize
with
the
boundless
delight
of
the
boys
remembering
how
as
a
boy
a
boat
delighted
me
and
then
again
these
worthy
dames
how
could
one
object
to
their
prying
gaze
mingled
as
it
was
with
friendly
smile
and
genuine
interest
the
stream
on
which
i
started
here
was
not
the
main
channel
of
the
danube
but
a
narrow
arm
of
the
river
conducted
through
the
town
while
the
other
part
fell
over
the
the
woodcut
shows
the
scene
at
starting
and
there
were
crowds
as
large
as
this
at
other
towns
but
a
picture
never
can
repeat
the
shouts
and
bustle
or
the
sound
of
guns
firing
and
bells
ringing
which
on
more
than
one
occasion
celebrated
the
rob
roy
morning
paddle
the
lovely
scenery
of
this
day
voyage
often
reminded
me
of
that
upon
the
wye
xii
in
its
best
parts
between
ross
and
chepstow
there
were
the
white
rocks
and
dark
trees
and
caverns
crags
and
jutting
peaks
you
meet
near
tintern
but
then
the
wye
has
no
islands
and
its
muddy
water
at
full
tide
has
a
worse
substitute
in
muddier
banks
when
the
sea
has
ebbed
xii
murray
says
the
meuse
has
been
compared
to
the
wye
but
is
even
more
romantic
than
the
english
river
i
would
rank
the
wye
as
much
above
the
meuse
as
below
the
danube
for
romance
in
scenery
the
islands
on
beauteous
donau
were
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
some
low
and
flat
and
thickly
covered
with
shrubs
others
of
stalwart
rock
stretching
up
at
a
sharp
angle
under
which
the
glassy
water
bubbled
all
fresh
and
clear
almost
each
minute
there
was
a
new
scene
and
often
i
backed
against
the
current
to
hold
my
post
in
the
best
view
of
some
grand
picture
magnificent
crags
reached
high
up
on
both
sides
and
impenetrable
forests
rung
with
echoes
when
i
shouted
in
the
glee
of
health
freedom
and
exquisite
enjoyment
but
scenes
and
sentiments
will
not
feed
the
hungry
paddler
so
i
decided
to
stop
at
friedingen
a
village
on
the
bank
there
was
a
difficulty
now
as
to
where
the
canoe
could
be
left
for
no
inn
seemed
near
enough
to
let
me
guard
her
while
i
breakfasted
at
length
a
mason
helped
me
to
carry
the
rob
roy
into
a
donkey
stable
and
a
boy
volunteered
to
guide
the
stranger
to
the
best
inn
the
first
and
the
second
and
the
third
he
led
me
to
were
all
beerhouses
where
only
drink
could
be
had
and
as
the
crowd
augmented
at
every
stage
i
dismissed
the
ragged
cicerone
and
trusted
myself
instead
to
the
sure
leading
of
that
unnamed
instinct
which
guides
a
hungry
man
to
food
even
the
place
found
at
last
was
soon
filled
with
wondering
spectators
a
piece
of
a
german
and
english
dictionary
from
my
baggage
excited
universal
attention
and
was
several
times
carried
outside
to
those
who
had
not
secured
reserved
seats
within
the
magnificent
scenery
culminated
at
beuron
where
a
great
convent
on
a
rich
mound
of
grass
is
nearly
surrounded
by
the
danube
amid
a
spacious
amphitheatre
of
magnificent
white
cliffs
perfectly
upright
and
clad
with
the
heaviest
wood
the
place
looks
so
lonely
though
fair
that
you
could
scarcely
believe
you
might
stop
there
for
the
night
and
so
i
had
nearly
swept
by
it
again
into
perfect
solitude
but
at
last
pulled
up
under
a
tree
and
walked
through
well
ploughed
fields
to
the
little
hamlet
in
this
sequestered
spot
the
field
labourers
were
of
course
surprised
at
the
apparition
of
a
man
in
flannel
who
must
have
come
out
of
the
river
but
the
people
at
the
kloster
had
already
heard
of
the
schiff
and
the
rob
roy
was
soon
mounted
on
two
men
shoulders
and
borne
in
triumph
to
the
excellent
hotel
the
prince
who
founded
the
monastery
is
i
believe
himself
a
monk
now
tolls
the
bell
for
even
song
while
my
dinner
is
spread
in
an
arbour
looking
out
on
this
grand
scene
made
grander
still
by
dark
clouds
gathering
on
the
mountains
and
a
loud
and
long
thunder
peal
with
torrents
of
rain
this
deluge
of
wet
came
opportunely
when
i
had
such
good
shelter
as
it
cooled
the
air
and
would
strengthen
the
stream
of
the
river
so
i
admired
the
venerable
monks
with
complacent
satisfaction
a
feeling
never
so
complete
as
when
you
are
inside
and
you
look
at
people
who
are
out
in
the
rain
a
young
girl
on
a
visit
to
her
friends
here
could
talk
bad
french
rapidly
so
she
was
sent
to
gossip
with
me
as
i
dined
and
then
the
whole
family
inspected
my
a
proceeding
which
happened
at
least
twice
every
day
for
many
weeks
of
the
voyage
this
emboldened
me
to
ask
for
some
music
and
we
adjourned
to
a
great
hall
where
a
concert
was
soon
in
progress
with
a
guitar
a
piano
and
a
violin
all
well
played
and
the
germans
are
never
at
a
loss
for
a
song
my
young
visitor
melanie
then
became
the
interpreter
in
a
curious
conversation
with
the
others
who
could
speak
only
german
and
i
ventured
to
turn
our
thoughts
on
some
of
the
nobler
things
which
ought
not
to
be
long
absent
from
the
mind
i
mean
what
is
loved
and
feared
enjoyed
and
derided
as
religion
in
my
very
limited
baggage
i
had
brought
some
selected
pieces
and
scripture
anecdotes
and
other
papers
in
french
and
german
and
these
were
used
on
appropriate
occasions
and
were
always
well
received
often
with
exceedingly
great
interest
and
sincere
gratitude
some
people
are
shy
about
giving
tracts
or
are
even
afraid
of
them
but
then
some
people
are
shy
of
speaking
at
all
or
even
dislike
to
ride
or
skate
or
row
one
need
not
laugh
at
another
for
this
the
practice
of
carrying
a
few
printed
pages
to
convey
in
clear
language
what
one
can
not
accurately
speak
in
a
foreign
tongue
is
surely
allowable
to
say
the
least
but
i
invariably
find
it
to
be
very
useful
and
interesting
to
myself
and
to
others
and
as
it
hurts
nobody
and
has
nothing
in
it
of
which
to
be
proud
or
ashamed
and
as
hundreds
of
men
do
it
and
as
i
have
done
it
for
years
and
will
do
it
again
i
am
far
too
old
a
traveller
to
be
laughed
out
of
it
now
the
kloster
at
beuron
is
a
favourite
place
for
excursionists
from
the
towns
in
the
neighbourhood
and
no
doubt
some
day
soon
it
will
be
a
regular
place
to
see
for
english
travellers
rowing
down
the
danube
for
it
is
thus
and
only
thus
you
can
approach
it
with
full
effect
the
moon
had
come
forth
as
i
leaned
out
of
my
bedroom
window
and
it
whitened
the
ample
circus
of
beetling
crags
and
darkened
the
trees
while
a
fainter
and
redder
light
glimmered
from
the
monks
chapel
as
the
low
tones
of
midnight
chanting
now
and
then
reached
the
ear
perhaps
it
is
better
to
wear
a
monk
cowl
than
to
wear
consistently
a
common
coat
in
the
workday
throng
of
life
and
it
be
better
to
fast
and
chant
and
kneel
at
shrines
than
to
be
temperate
and
thankful
and
prayerful
in
the
busy
world
but
i
doubt
after
leaving
beuron
with
the
firing
of
guns
and
the
usual
pleasant
good
wishes
from
the
shore
the
danube
carried
us
between
two
lofty
rocks
and
down
calm
reaches
for
hours
the
water
was
unspeakably
clear
you
could
see
right
into
deep
caverns
far
below
i
used
to
gaze
downwards
for
so
long
a
time
at
the
fish
moving
about
and
to
strike
at
them
with
my
long
paddle
never
once
hitting
any
that
i
forgot
the
boat
was
swinging
along
all
the
time
till
bump
she
went
on
a
bank
or
crash
against
a
rocky
isle
or
rumbling
into
some
thick
trees
when
a
shower
of
leaves
spiders
and
rubbish
wakened
up
my
reverie
then
warned
by
the
shock
i
return
to
the
plain
duty
of
looking
ahead
until
perhaps
after
an
hour
active
rushing
through
narrow
guts
and
over
little
falls
and
getting
out
and
hauling
the
boat
down
larger
ones
my
eyes
are
wandering
again
gazing
at
the
peaks
overhead
and
at
the
eagles
soaring
above
them
and
at
the
clear
blue
sky
above
all
till
again
the
rob
roy
heels
over
on
a
sunken
stone
and
i
have
to
jump
out
nimbly
to
save
her
from
utter
destruction
for
days
together
i
had
my
feet
bare
and
my
trousers
tucked
up
ready
to
wade
at
any
moment
and
perfectly
comfortable
all
the
time
for
a
fiery
sun
dried
every
thing
in
a
few
minutes
the
physical
enjoyment
of
such
a
life
to
one
in
good
health
and
good
spirits
with
a
good
boat
and
good
scenery
is
only
to
be
appreciated
after
experience
for
these
little
reminders
that
one
must
not
actually
on
a
rushing
river
never
resulted
in
any
disaster
and
i
came
home
without
a
cold
or
a
scratch
or
a
hole
in
the
boat
or
one
single
day
regretted
may
this
be
so
for
many
a
john
bull
let
loose
on
the
continent
to
paddle
his
own
canoe
on
the
rivers
where
there
is
no
navigation
and
no
towing
paths
it
was
impossible
to
estimate
the
distances
traversed
each
day
except
by
the
number
of
hours
i
was
at
work
the
average
speed
the
strength
of
the
wind
and
current
and
the
number
of
stoppages
for
food
or
rest
or
waterfalls
or
barriers
thirty
miles
was
reckoned
to
be
a
good
day
work
and
i
have
sometimes
gone
forty
miles
in
a
day
but
twenty
was
quite
enough
when
the
scenery
and
incidents
on
the
way
filled
up
every
moment
of
time
with
varied
sensations
of
new
pleasures
it
will
generally
be
found
i
think
that
for
walking
in
a
pleasant
country
twenty
miles
a
day
is
enough
for
mind
and
body
to
be
active
and
observant
all
the
time
but
the
events
that
occur
in
river
work
are
far
more
frequent
and
interesting
than
those
on
the
road
for
you
have
all
the
circumstances
of
your
boat
in
addition
to
what
fills
the
pedestrian
journal
and
after
a
little
time
your
canoe
becomes
so
much
a
companion
friend
shall
i
say
that
every
turn
it
takes
and
every
knock
and
grate
on
its
side
is
felt
as
if
it
were
your
own
the
boat
gets
to
be
individualized
and
so
does
the
river
till
at
last
there
is
a
pleasant
rivalry
set
up
for
it
is
man
and
boat
the
river
and
all
it
can
place
in
your
way
after
a
few
tours
on
the
continent
your
first
hour
in
a
railway
or
diligence
may
be
new
and
enjoyable
but
you
soon
begin
to
wish
for
the
end
of
the
road
and
after
a
short
stay
in
the
town
you
have
come
to
you
begin
to
talk
or
think
of
when
you
are
to
leave
now
a
feature
of
the
boating
tour
is
that
quiet
progress
can
be
enjoyed
all
the
time
because
you
have
personal
exertion
or
engagement
for
every
moment
and
your
observation
of
the
scenery
around
is
now
most
minute
and
interesting
because
every
bend
and
slope
of
it
tells
at
once
what
you
have
to
do
certainly
the
pleasure
of
a
day
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
number
of
miles
you
have
gone
over
the
voyage
yesterday
for
instance
was
one
of
the
very
best
for
enjoyment
of
scenery
incident
and
exercise
yet
it
was
the
shortest
day
i
had
the
says
tuttlingen
is
twelve
miles
by
river
say
eighteen
from
kloster
beuron
where
the
fine
scenery
begins
this
part
of
the
danube
is
not
navigable
i
will
not
say
that
on
some
occasions
i
did
not
wish
for
the
end
of
the
day
work
when
arms
were
weary
and
the
sun
was
low
and
yearnings
of
the
inner
man
grumbling
for
dinner
especially
when
no
one
could
tell
how
far
it
was
to
any
house
or
whether
you
could
stop
there
all
night
if
you
reached

benighted
the
sides
of
the
river
were
now
less
precipitous
and
the
road
came
within
a
field
or
two
of
the
water
and
made
it
seem
quite
homely
for
a
time
i
had
heard
a
loud
jingling
sound
on
this
road
for
at
least
and
observed
a
long
cart
with
two
horses
trotting
fast
and
evidently
daring
to
race
with
the
rob
roy
but
at
length
such
earnest
signals
were
made
from
it
that
i
stopped
and
the
cart
at
once
pulled
up
and
from
it
there
ran
across
the
field
a
man
breathless
and
hot
without
his
hat
and
followed
by
two
young
ladies
equally
hurried
he
was
a
german
resident
for
a
short
time
in
london
and
now
at
home
for
a
month
holiday
and
he
was
prodigal
of
thanks
for
my
great
courtesy
in
having
stopped
that
the
ladies
might
see
the
canoe
which
they
had
followed
thus
for
some
miles
having
heard
of
its
fame
at
their
village
on
another
occasion
three
youths
voluntarily
ran
alongside
the
boat
and
panted
in
the
sun
and
tumbled
over
stocks
and
stones
at
such
a
rate
that
after
a
mile
of
the
supererogatory
exercise
i
asked
what
it
was
all
about
excellent
villagers
they
had
taken
all
this
trouble
to
arrive
at
a
point
further
down
the
stream
where
they
knew
there
was
a
hard
place
and
they
thought
they
might
help
me
in
passing
it
such
exertions
on
behalf
of
a
stranger
were
really
most
kind
and
when
i
allowed
them
to
give
a
nominal
help
where
in
reality
it
was
easy
enough
to
get
on
unaided
they
were
much
delighted
and
more
than
rewarded
and
went
back
prattling
their
purest
suabian
in
a
highly
satisfied
frame
of
mind
many
are
the
bends
and
currents
but
at
last
we
arrive
at
the
town
of
sigmaringen
it
has
certainly
an
aristocratic
air
though
there
are
only
inhabitants
but
then
it
has
a
principality
though
the
whole
population
of
this
is
only
fancy
a
parish
in
london
with
a
prince
all
to
themselves
and
bearing
such
a
fine
grand
name
too
his
royal
serene
highness
the
hereditary
prince
of
hohenzollern
sigmaringen
but
though
i
have
often
laughed
at
this
petty
kingdom
in
the
geography
books
i
shall
never
do
so
again
for
it
contains
some
of
the
most
beautiful
river
scenery
in
the
world
and
i
never
had
more
unalloyed
pleasure
in
passing
through
a
foreign
dominion
there
are
pretty
gardens
here
and
a
handsome
protestant
church
and
a
few
good
shops
schlosses
on
the
hills
and
older
castles
perched
on
high
rocks
in
the
usual
picturesque
and
uncomfortable
places
where
our
ancestors
built
their
nests
the
deutscher
hof
is
the
hotel
just
opened
three
weeks
ago
and
all
its
inmates
are
in
a
flutter
when
their
first
english
guest
marches
up
to
the
door
with
a
boat
and
a
great
company
of
gazers
the
waiter
too
all
fresh
from
a
year
in
london
at
the
palace
hotel
buckingham
gate
how
glad
he
is
that
his
english
is
now
in
requisition
sitting
by
me
at
dinner
and
talking
most
sensibly
all
the
time
the
weather
still
continued
superb
as
we
paddled
away
deep
green
woods
dipped
their
lower
branches
in
the
water
but
i
found
that
the
stream
had
sometimes
a
fashion
of
carrying
the
boat
under
these
and
it
is
especially
needful
to
guard
against
this
when
a
sharp
bend
with
a
fast
current
hurries
you
into
a
wooded
corner
indeed
strange
as
it
may
seem
there
was
more
danger
to
the
boat
from
these
trees
than
from
rocks
or
banks
and
far
more
trouble
for
when
the
boat
gets
under
their
low
branches
your
paddle
is
quite
powerless
because
you
can
not
lower
one
end
to
hold
the
water
without
raising
the
other
and
so
catching
it
in
the
trees
then
if
you
put
your
head
down
forward
you
can
not
see
and
the
boughs
are
generally
as
hard
as
an
ordinary
skull
when
the
two
are
in
collision
finally
if
you
lean
backwards
the
twigs
scrape
your
face
and
catch
upon
a
nose
even
of
ordinary
length
and
if
you
take
your
hand
from
the
paddle
to
protect
the
face
away
goes
the
paddle
into
the
river
therefore
although
my
hat
was
never
knocked
off
and
my
skull
was
always
the
hardest
and
my
paddle
was
never
lost
and
my
nose
was
never
by
the
branches
i
set
it
down
as
a
maxim
to
keep
clear
of
trees
in
a
stream
still
it
was
tempting
to
go
under
shady
groves
when
i
tried
to
surprise
a
flock
of
herons
or
a
family
of
wild
ducks
once
we
came
upon
herons
all
together
as
my
boat
advanced
silently
steadily
gliding
it
was
curious
to
watch
these
birds
who
had
certainly
never
been
disturbed
before
by
any
boat
in
such
a
place
they
stared
eagerly
at
me
and
then
looked
at
each
other
and
evidently
took
a
vote
of
the
assembly
as
to
what
all
this
could
mean
if
faces
can
give
any
expression
of
their
opinions
it
is
certain
that
one
of
these
herons
was
saying
then
to
the
others
did
you
ever
and
an
indignant
sneer
was
on
another
beak
that
plainly
answered
such
impudence
indeed
while
a
third
added
with
a
sarcastic
chirp
and
a
foreigner
too
but
after
consultation
they
always
got
up
and
circled
round
flew
down
stream
and
then
settled
all
again
together
in
an
adjourned
meeting
a
few
minutes
brought
me
to
their
new
retreat
and
so
we
went
on
for
miles
they
always
flying
down
stream
and
always
assembling
though
over
and
over
again
disturbed
until
an
amendment
on
the
plan
was
moved
and
they
bent
their
way
aside
a
pleasant
and
favourable
breeze
springing
up
which
soon
freshened
into
a
gale
i
now
set
my
sails
and
the
boat
went
with
very
great
speed
dashing
over
rocks
and
bounding
past
the
haymakers
so
fast
that
when
one
who
caught
sight
of
her
had
shouted
to
the
rest
of
his
mates
the
sight
was
departed
for
ever
before
they
came
and
i
heard
them
behind
me
arguing
probably
about
the
ghost
but
it
was
a
shame
to
be
a
phantom
ship
too
often
and
it
was
far
more
amusing
to
go
right
into
the
middle
of
these
people
who
knew
nothing
about
the
canoe
who
had
never
seen
a
boat
and
never
met
a
foreigner
in
their
lives
thus
when
a
waterfall
was
found
too
high
to
shoot
or
a
wide
barrier
made
it
advisable
to
take
the
boat
by
land
i
used
to
walk
straight
into
the
hayfields
pushing
the
boat
point
foremost
through
a
hedge
or
dragging
her
steadily
over
the
wet
grass
in
literal
imitation
of
the
american
craft
which
could
go
wherever
there
was
a
heavy
dew
on
such
occasions
the
amazement
of
the
untaught
clowns
beholding
suddenly
such
an
apparition
was
beyond
all
description
some
even
ran
away
very
often
children
cried
outright
and
when
i
looked
gravely
on
the
ground
as
i
marched
and
dragged
the
boat
and
then
suddenly
stopped
in
their
midst
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
an
address
in
english
the
whole
proceeding
may
have
appeared
to
them
at
least
as
strange
as
it
did
to
me
illustration
in
the
hayfields
the
water
of
the
river
all
at
once
became
here
of
a
pale
white
colour
and
i
was
mourning
that
my
pretty
scenes
below
were
clouded
but
in
about
thirty
miles
the
pebbly
deeps
appeared
again
and
the
stream
resumed
its
charming
limpid
clearness
this
matter
of
dark
or
bright
water
is
of
some
importance
because
when
it
is
clear
you
can
easily
estimate
after
a
little
experience
the
general
depth
even
at
some
distance
by
the
shades
and
hues
of
the
water
while
the
sunk
rocks
big
stones
and
other
particular
obstacles
are
of
course
more
visible
then
usually
i
got
well
enough
fed
at
some
village
or
at
least
at
a
house
but
in
this
lonely
part
of
the
river
it
seemed
wise
to
take
provender
with
me
in
the
boat
and
to
picnic
in
some
quiet
pool
with
a
shady
tree
above
one
of
the
very
few
boats
i
saw
on
the
river
appeared
as
i
was
thus
engaged
and
a
little
boy
was
in
it
his
specimen
of
naval
architecture
no
doubt
the
only
one
he
had
ever
seen
was
an
odd
contrast
to
the
beautifully
finished
canoe
made
by
searle
he
had
a
pole
and
a
shovel
the
latter
article
he
used
as
a
paddle
and
his
boat
was
of
enormous
thickness
and
clumsiness
made
of
three
planks
abundantly
clamped
with
iron
i
gave
him
some
bread
and
we
had
a
chat
then
some
butter
and
then
some
cheese
he
would
not
take
wine
but
he
produced
a
cigar
from
his
wet
jacket
and
also
two
matches
which
he
lighted
with
great
skill
we
soon
got
to
be
friends
as
people
do
who
are
together
alone
and
in
the
same
mode
of
travelling
riding
or
sailing
or
on
camels
backs
so
we
smiled
in
sympathy
and
i
asked
him
if
he
could
read
and
gave
him
a
neat
little
page
prettily
printed
in
german
with
a
red
border
this
he
read
very
nicely
and
was
glad
to
put
in
his
ragged
pocket
but
he
could
scarcely
part
from
me
and
struggled
vainly
to
urge
his
tub
along
with
the
shovel
till
we
came
to
a
run
of
dashing
waves
and
then
of
course
i
had
to
leave
him
behind
looking
and
yearning
with
a
low
murmuring
sound
and
a
sorrowful
earnest
gaze
i
shall
never
forget
shoals
of
large
and
small
fish
are
in
this
river
and
very
few
fishermen
i
did
not
see
ten
men
fishing
in
ten
days
but
the
pretty
little
kingfisher
does
not
neglect
his
proper
duties
and
ever
and
anon
his
round
blue
back
shines
in
the
sun
as
he
hurries
away
with
a
note
of
protest
against
the
stranger
who
has
invaded
his
preserves
bees
are
buzzing
while
the
sun
is
hot
and
when
it
sinks
out
gush
the
endless
mazes
of
gnats
to
hop
and
flit
their
tangled
dances
the
creatures
of
a
day
born
since
the
morning
and
to
die
at
night
before
the
danube
parted
with
the
rocks
that
had
been
on
each
side
for
days
together
it
played
some
strange
pranks
among
them
and
they
with
it
often
they
rose
at
each
side
a
hundred
feet
without
a
bend
and
then
behind
these
were
broken
cliffs
heaved
this
way
and
that
or
tossed
upside
down
or
as
bridges
hanging
over
chasms
here
and
there
a
huge
splinted
spire
of
stone
stuck
out
of
the
water
leaning
at
an
angle
sometimes
in
front
there
was
a
veritable
upright
wall
as
smooth
as
if
it
were
chiselled
and
entirely
cutting
off
the
middle
of
the
stream
in
advancing
steadily
to
such
a
place
it
was
really
impossible
to
determine
on
which
side
the
stream
could
by
any
means
find
an
exit
and
once
indeed
i
was
persuaded
that
it
must
descend
below
in
other
cases
the
river
which
had
splayed
out
its
width
to
that
of
the
thames
at
hungerford
would
suddenly
narrow
its
size
to
a
passage
and
rush
down
that
with
a
whishhh
the
rob
roy
cheerily
sped
through
these
but
i
landed
to
scan
the
course
before
attempting
the
most
difficult
oh
how
lonely
it
was
a
more
difficult
vagary
to
cope
with
was
when
in
a
dozen
petty
streams
the
water
tumbled
over
as
many
little
cascades
and
only
one
was
passable
sometimes
not
one
the
interest
of
finding
these
examining
trying
failing
and
succeeding
was
a
continuous
delight
and
filled
up
every
mile
with
a
series
of
exciting
incidents
till
at
length
the
rocks
were
done
and
now
we
enter
a
vast
plain
with
the
stream
bending
round
on
itself
and
hurrying
swiftly
on
through
the
innumerable
islands
eddies
and
snags
or
trees
uprooted
sticking
in
the
water
at
the
most
critical
part
of
this
labyrinth
we
were
going
a
tremendous
pace
when
suddenly
we
came
to
a
fork
in
the
river
with
the
volumes
of
water
going
down
both
channels
nearly
equal
we
could
not
descend
by
one
of
these
because
a
tree
would
catch
the
mast
so
i
instantly
turned
into
the
other
when
up
started
a
man
and
shouted
impetuously
that
no
boat
could
pass
by
course
it
was
a
moment
of
danger
but
i
lowered
the
sails
in
that
moment
took
down
my
mast
and
despite
stream
and
gale
i
managed
to
paddle
back
to
the
proper
channel
as
no
man
had
been
seen
for
hours
before
the
arrival
of
this
warning
note
was
opportune
a
new
amusement
was
invented
it
was
to
pitch
out
my
empty
and
to
watch
its
curious
bobbings
and
whirlings
as
the
current
carried
it
along
while
i
floated
near
and
compared
the
natural
course
taken
by
the
bottle
with
the
selected
route
which
intelligence
gave
to
the
rob
roy
soon
the
bottle
became
impersonated
and
we
were
racing
together
and
then
a
sympathy
began
for
its
cork
as
it
plumped
down
when
its
bottom
struck
a
stone
for
the
bottle
drew
more
water
than
my
canoe
and
every
time
it
grounded
there
came
a
loud
and
melancholy
clink
of
the
glass
and
down
it
went
the
thick
bushes
near
the
river
skirted
it
now
for
miles
and
at
one
place
i
could
see
above
me
through
the
upper
branches
about
haymakers
men
and
women
who
were
honestly
working
away
and
therefore
had
not
observed
my
approach
i
resolved
to
have
a
bit
of
fun
here
so
we
closed
in
to
the
bank
but
still
so
as
to
see
the
industrious
group
then
suddenly
i
began
in
a
very
loud
voice
with
rule
britannia
britannia
rules
the
waves
long
before
i
got
to
the
word
slaves
the
whole
party
were
like
statues
silent
and
fixed
in
amazement
then
they
looked
right
left
before
behind
and
upwards
in
all
directions
except
of
course
into
the
river
for
why
should
they
look
nothing
had
ever
come
up
from
the
river
to
disturb
their
quiet
mead
i
next
whistled
a
lively
air
and
then
dashing
out
of
my
stood
up
in
my
boat
and
made
a
brief
but
we
trust
brilliant
speech
to
them
in
the
best
english
i
could
muster
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
we
had
vanished
from
their
sight
a
little
further
on
there
was
some
in
progress
and
i
pulled
up
my
boat
under
a
tree
and
walked
up
to
the
barraque
or
canteen
and
entered
among
or
german
navvies
who
were
sitting
at
their
midday
beer
i
ordered
a
glass
and
drank
their
health
standing
paid
bowed
and
departed
but
a
general
rush
ensued
to
see
where
on
earth
this
being
had
come
from
and
they
stood
on
the
bank
in
a
row
as
i
waded
shoved
hauled
paddled
and
carried
my
boat
through
a
troublesome
labyrinth
of
channels
and
embankments
with
which
their
engineering
had
begun
to
spoil
the
river
but
the
bridges
one
had
now
more
frequently
to
meet
were
far
worse
encroachments
of
civilization
for
most
of
them
were
so
low
that
my
mast
would
not
pass
under
without
heeling
the
boat
over
to
one
side
so
as
to
make
the
mast
lean
down
obliquely
in
one
case
of
this
kind
she
was
very
nearly
shipwrecked
for
the
wind
was
so
good
that
i
would
not
lower
the
sail
and
this
and
a
swift
current
took
us
me
and
my
boat
she
is
now
you
see
installed
as
a
person
rapidly
to
the
centre
arch
when
just
as
we
entered
i
noticed
a
snag
with
a
sharp
point
exactly
in
my
course
to
swerve
to
the
side
would
be
to
strike
the
wooden
pier
but
even
this
would
be
better
for
i
might
ward
off
the
violence
of
a
blow
near
my
hands
than
to
run
on
the
snag
which
would
be
certain
to
cut
a
hole
with
a
heavy
thump
on
the
pier
the
canoe
began
to
capsize
and
only
by
the
nearest
escape
was
she
saved
from
foundering
what
i
thought
was
a
snag
turned
out
to
be
the
point
of
an
iron
stake
or
railing
carelessly
thrown
into
the
water
from
the
bridge
above
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
many
hidden
dangers
occur
near
bridges
for
there
are
wooden
or
iron
bars
fixed
under
water
or
rough
sharp
stones
lying
about
which
being
left
there
when
the
bridge
was
building
are
never
removed
from
a
river
not
navigable
or
used
by
boats
another
kind
of
obstruction
is
the
thin
wire
rope
suspended
across
the
rivers
where
a
ferry
is
established
by
running
a
flat
boat
over
the
stream
with
cords
attached
to
the
wire
rope
the
rope
is
black
in
colour
and
therefore
is
not
noticed
till
you
approach
it
too
near
to
lower
the
mast
but
this
sort
of
danger
is
easily
avoided
by
the
somewhat
sharp
which
a
week
or
two
on
the
water
makes
quite
instinctive
and
habitual
perhaps
one
of
the
many
advantages
of
a
river
tour
is
the
increased
acuteness
of
observation
which
it
requires
and
fosters
i
stopped
next
at
a
clumsy
sort
of
town
called
riedlingen
where
an
englishman
is
a
very
rare
visitor
the
excitement
here
about
the
boat
became
almost
ridiculous
and
one
german
who
had
been
in
america
and
could
jabber
a
little
in
english
was
deputed
to
ask
questions
while
the
rest
heard
the
answers
interpreted
next
morning
at
eight
at
least
a
thousand
people
gathered
on
the
bridge
and
its
approaches
to
see
the
boat
start
and
shoals
of
schoolboys
ran
in
each
with
his
little
knapsack
of
xiii
xiii
knapsack
from
schnap
sach
provision
bag
for
bits
and
bats
as
we
should
say
havresack
is
from
hafer
forage
bag
does
this
youthful
carriage
of
the
knapsack
adapt
boys
for
military
service
and
does
it
account
for
the
high
shoulders
of
many
germans
the
scenery
after
this
became
of
only
ordinary
interest
compared
with
what
i
had
passed
through
but
there
would
have
been
little
spare
time
to
look
at
it
had
it
been
ever
so
picturesque
for
the
wind
was
quite
a
gale
xiv
and
right
in
my
favour
and
the
stream
was
fast
and
tortuous
with
banks
eddies
and
innumerable
islands
and
cross
channels
so
that
the
navigation
occupied
all
one
energy
especially
as
it
was
a
point
of
honour
not
to
haul
down
the
sail
in
a
fair
wind
xiv
in
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
weather
it
was
stated
that
at
this
time
a
storm
swept
over
central
europe
midday
came
and
yet
i
could
find
no
place
to
breakfast
though
the
excitement
and
exertion
of
thus
sailing
was
really
hard
work
but
still
we
hurried
on
for
dark
clouds
were
gathering
behind
and
thunder
and
rain
seemed
very
near
ah
said
i
inwardly
had
i
only
listened
to
that
worthy
entreaties
this
morning
to
take
good
provision
for
the
day
she
had
smiled
like
the
best
of
mothers
and
timidly
asked
to
be
allowed
to
touch
my
it
was
so
so
beautiful
to
see
but
oddly
enough
we
had
taken
no
solid
food
on
board
being
so
impatient
to
get
off
when
the
wind
was
strong
and
fair
the
rapid
pace
then
brought
us
to
ehingen
the
village
i
had
marked
on
the
map
for
this
night
rest
but
now
we
came
there
it
was
found
to
be
i
could
not
stop
for
the
day
with
such
a
splendid
breeze
inviting
progress
nor
would
it
do
to
leave
the
boat
on
the
bank
and
go
to
the
village
to
eat
for
it
was
too
far
from
the
river
and
so
the
current
and
sails
must
hurry
us
on
as
before
now
and
then
i
asked
some
gazing
agriculturist
on
the
bank
where
the
nearest
houses
were
but
he
never
could
understand
that
i
meant
and
also
close
to
the
so
the
end
of
every
discussion
was
that
he
said
ya
vol
which
means
in
yankee
tongue
that
so
in
scottish
hoot
aye
in
irish
troth
an
it
is
and
in
french
vrai
but
then
none
of
this
helps
one
a
bit
i
therefore
got
first
ravenous
and
then
faint
and
after
mounting
the
bank
to
see
the
turns
of
the
river
in
advance
i
actually
fell
asleep
under
a
tree
the
wind
had
quite
subsided
when
i
awoke
and
then
quaffed
deep
draughts
of
water
and
paddled
on
the
banks
were
now
of
yellow
mud
and
about
eight
or
ten
feet
high
quite
straight
up
from
the
water
just
like
those
on
the
nile
and
several
affluent
streams
ran
from
the
plain
to
join
the
river
often
indeed
i
saw
a
church
tower
right
ahead
and
laboured
along
to
get
there
but
after
the
stream
would
turn
sharp
round
to
one
side
and
still
more
and
more
round
and
at
last
the
tower
once
in
front
was
directly
behind
us
the
explanation
of
this
tormenting
peculiarity
was
simply
this
that
the
villages
were
carefully
built
from
the
river
bank
because
it
is
a
bad
foundation
and
is
washed
away
as
new
channels
are
formed
by
the
flood
when
the
light
began
to
fail
i
took
a
good
look
at
the
map
and
serpentine
bends
were
marked
on
it
plain
enough
indeed
but
only
in
of
their
actual
number
and
moreover
i
saw
that
in
the
forest
we
had
now
entered
there
would
be
no
suitable
villages
at
all
the
overhanging
trees
made
a
short
twilight
soon
deepen
into
night
and
to
add
to
the
interest
the
snags
suddenly
became
numerous
and
some
of
them
waved
about
in
the
current
as
they
do
on
the
upper
mississippi
when
the
tenacious
mud
holds
down
the
roots
merely
by
its
weight
all
this
made
it
necessary
to
paddle
slowly
and
with
great
caution
and
to
cross
always
to
the
slack
side
of
the
stream
instead
of
by
one
usual
course
which
in
descending
is
to
keep
with
the
rapid
current
sometimes
i
had
to
back
out
of
shallows
which
were
invisible
in
the
dark
and
often
i
stopped
a
long
time
before
a
glance
of
some
ripple
obscurely
told
me
the
probable
course
the
necessity
for
this
caution
will
be
evident
when
it
is
remembered
that
in
case
of
an
upset
here
sets
of
clothes
would
have
been
wet
together
and
without
any
house
at
hand
to
dry
them
all
at
once
i
heard
a
bell
toll
quite
near
me
in
the
thick
wood
and
i
came
to
the
bank
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
ashore
on
it
so
i
passed
that
place
too
and
finally
made
up
my
mind
to
sleep
in
the
boat
and
soon
had
all
sorts
of
plans
in
course
of
devising
just
then
two
drops
of
rain
came
on
my
nose
and
i
resolved
at
once
to
stop
for
if
my
clothes
got
wet
before
i
was
snug
in
the
canoe
there
would
be
little
comfort
all
night
without
anything
solid
to
eat
since
morning
and
all
my
cigars
already
puffed
away
as
i
now
cautiously
searched
for
some
root
projecting
from
the
bank
to
make
fast
to
a
light
appeared
straight
in
front
and
i
dashed
forward
with
the
boat
to
reach
it
and
speedily
ran
her
into
a
strange
sort
of
lake
or
pond
where
the
stream
ceased
and
a
noise
on
the
boat
side
told
of
weeds
which
proved
to
be
large
round
leaves
on
the
surface
like
those
of
the
victoria
regia
lily
i
drew
up
the
boat
on
shore
and
mounted
the
high
bank
through
a
thicket
carrying
my
long
paddle
as
a
protection
against
the
large
dogs
which
farmhouses
sport
here
and
which
might
be
troublesome
to
quarrel
with
in
the
dark
the
house
i
came
to
on
the
top
of
the
precipice
had
its
window
lighted
and
several
people
were
talking
inside
so
i
knocked
loudly
and
all
was
silence
then
i
knocked
again
and
whined
out
that
i
was
a
poor
benighted
englander
and
hoped
they
would
let
me
in
at
which
melancholy
tale
they
burst
out
laughing
and
so
did
i
after
an
argument
between
us
which
was
equally
intelligible
on
both
sides
a
fat
farmer
cautiously
took
the
light
upstairs
and
opening
a
window
thrust
the
candle
forward
and
gazed
out
upon
me
standing
erect
as
a
true
briton
and
with
my
paddle
too
but
in
reality
a
humiliated
vagrant
begging
for
a
night
lodging
illustration
illustration
after
due
scrutiny
he
pulled
in
his
head
and
his
candle
shut
the
window
and
fell
to
laughing
immoderately
at
this
i
was
glad
for
i
never
found
it
difficult
to
get
on
with
a
man
who
begins
in
good
humour
presently
the
others
went
up
and
i
stood
their
gaze
unflinchingly
and
besides
made
an
eloquent
appeal
in
the
vernacular
mine
not
theirs
be
it
clearly
understood
finally
they
were
satisfied
that
i
was
alone
and
though
probably
mad
yet
not
quite
a
match
for
all
of
them
so
they
came
down
gallantly
but
then
there
was
the
difficulty
of
persuading
the
man
to
grope
down
to
the
river
on
this
dark
night
to
carry
up
a
boat
with
some
exertion
we
got
it
up
by
a
better
way
and
safely
locked
it
in
the
cowhouse
of
another
establishment
and
there
i
was
made
thoroughly
comfortable
they
said
they
had
nothing
to
eat
but
kirchwasser
bread
and
eggs
and
how
many
eggs
would
i
like
so
i
said
to
begin
with
ten
and
i
ate
them
every
one
by
this
time
the
priest
had
come
they
often
used
to
send
for
the
to
do
the
talk
the
large
room
soon
got
full
and
the
was
passed
round
and
an
band
made
endless
merriment
for
the
smaller
fry
all
in
the
old
routine
the
very
mention
of
which
it
may
be
tedious
to
hear
of
so
often
as
indeed
it
was
to
me
to
perform
but
then
in
each
case
it
was
first
time
of
going
through
the
performance
and
they
were
so
kind
and
courteous
one
could
not
refuse
to
please
such
people
the
priest
was
very
communicative
and
we
tried
to
converse
in
latin
for
my
german
was
not
good
enough
for
him
nor
his
french
for
me
but
we
soon
agreed
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
our
schoolboy
latin
days
though
i
recollect
having
had
long
conversations
in
latin
with
a
monk
at
nazareth
but
there
we
had
ten
days
together
and
so
had
time
to
practise
thus
ended
the
of
september
the
only
occasion
on
which
i
had
to
rough
it
at
all
during
the
voyage
and
even
then
it
may
be
seen
the
very
small
discomforts
were
all
the
results
of
gross
want
of
prudence
on
my
own
part
and
ended
merely
by
a
hard
day
work
with
breakfast
and
dinner
merged
into
a
late
supper
my
bill
here
was
the
day
before

the
threatening
rain
had
not
come
during
the
night
and
it
was
a
lovely
morning
next
day
like
all
the
rest
before
and
after
it
and
as
we
were
leaving
this
place
i
found
it
was
called
gegglingen
xv
and
was
only
nine
miles
from
ulm
xv
it
will
be
noticed
how
the
termination
is
common
here
thus
in
our
water
route
we
have
passed
donaueschingen
geisingen
mehringen
tuttlingen
friedingen
sigmaringen
riedlingen
ehingen
dischingen
and
gegglingen
the
least
and
last
in
england
we
have
the
ing
in
dorking
kettering
the
lofty
tower
of
the
cathedral
of
this
town
soon
came
in
view
but
i
noticed
it
without
any
pleasure
for
this
was
to
end
my
week
on
the
danube
and
in
my
ship
log
it
is
entered
as
one
of
the
most
pleasant
weeks
of
my
life
for
scenery
health
weather
exercise
and
varied
adventure
in
a
pensive
mood
therefore
i
landed
at
a
garden
and
reclined
on
a
warm
mossy
bank
to
have
a
rest
and
a
but
very
soon
the
loud
booming
of
artillery
aroused
the
hill
echoes
and
then
sharp
rattling
of
infantry
firing
the
heights
around
were
crested
with
fringes
of
soldiers
and
glistening
bayonets
amid
the
soft
round
volumes
of
smoke
from
the
great
guns
spurting
out
fire
long
before
the
sound
comes
it
was
a
review
of
troops
and
a
sham
attack
on
a
fort
surmounting
the
hill
near
the
battlefield
of
long
years
ago
at
ulm
if
they
fought
in
heat
and
fury
let
them
now
rest
in
peace
come
back
my
thoughts
to
the
river
at
my
feet
i
had
been
with
this
river
from
its
infancy
nay
even
from
its
birth
in
the
schwartzwald
i
had
followed
it
right
and
left
as
it
seemed
to
toddle
in
zigzag
turnings
like
a
child
and
i
had
wound
with
it
hither
and
thither
as
it
roamed
away
further
like
free
boyhood
then
it
grew
in
size
by
feeding
on
the
oozy
plain
and
was
still
my
companion
when
it
got
the
strength
of
youth
dashing
over
the
rocks
and
bounding
through
the
forests
and
i
had
come
at
last
to
feel
its
powerful
stream
stronger
than
my
strength
and
compelling
my
respect
and
now
at
ulm
i
found
it
a
noble
river
steady
and
swift
as
if
in
the
flower
of
age
but
its
romance
was
gone
it
had
boats
on
it
and
navigation
and
bridges
and
railways
like
other
great
waters
and
so
i
would
let
it
go
on
alone
tumbling
rushing
swelling
till
its
broad
bosom
bears
whole
fleets
at
ofen
and
at
length
as
a
great
water
giant
it
leaps
down
headlong
into
the
black
sea
having
seen
ulm
in
a
former
tour
i
was
in
no
mood
to
go
over
the
sights
again
nor
need
they
be
related
here
for
it
is
only
river
travel
and
lake
sailing
that
we
are
concerned
with
while
reference
may
be
made
to
the
if
you
wish
to
hear
this
sort
of
thing
ulm
lat
an
old
cathedral
town
on
two
hills
see
pop
situated
on
the
danube
at
that
i
stop
and
look
into
the
water
once
more
the
river
is
discoloured
here
what
is
called
in
scotland
drumly
and
this
seems
partly
owing
to
the
tributary
which
rises
in
the
tyrol
and
falls
into
the
danube
a
little
way
above
the
town
the
iller
has
a
peculiar
air
of
wild
forlorn
bleakness
with
its
wide
channel
half
occupied
by
cold
white
gravel
and
its
banks
scored
and
torn
with
weird
broken
roots
gnarled
trees
bleakness
and
fallen
all
lying
dishevelled
surely
in
flood
times
and
of
dark
wintry
nights
a
very
deluge
boils
and
seethes
along
there
then
at
last
there
are
the
barges
on
the
danube
and
very
rudimental
they
are
huge
in
size
with
flat
bottoms
and
bows
and
stems
cocked
up
and
a
roofed
house
in
the
middle
of
their
sprawling
length
the
german
boys
must
have
these
models
before
them
when
they
make
the
noah
arks
for
english
nurseries
and
murray
well
says
of
these
barges
they
are
nothing
better
than
wooden
sheds
floating
in
flat
trays
in
a
steamer
was
tried
here
but
it
got
on
a
bank
and
the
effort
was
abandoned
so
you
have
to
go
on
to
donauwerth
before
this
mode
of
travelling
is
reached
but
from
thence
you
can
steam
down
to
the
black
sea
and
the
passage
boats
below
vienna
are
very
fast
and
well
appointed
rafts
there
are
at
ulm
but
we
suppose
the
timber
for
them
comes
by
the
iller
for
i
did
not
notice
any
logs
descending
the
upper
part
of
the
danube
again
there
are
the
public
washhouses
in
the
river
each
of
them
a
large
floating
establishment
with
overhanging
eaves
under
which
you
can
see
say
fifty
women
all
in
a
row
half
kneeling
or
leaning
over
the
low
bulwarks
and
all
slapping
your
best
shirts
mercilessly
i
made
straight
over
to
these
ladies
and
asked
how
the
rob
roy
could
get
up
so
steep
a
bank
and
how
far
it
was
to
the
railway
and
so
their
senior
matron
kindly
got
a
man
and
a
for
the
boat
and
as
the
company
of
women
heard
it
was
from
england
they
all
talked
louder
and
more
together
and
pounded
and
smacked
the
unfortunate
linen
with
additional
emphasis
the
bustle
at
the
was
only
half
about
the
canoe
the
other
half
was
for
the
king
of
wurtemburg
who
was
getting
into
his
special
train
to
go
to
his
palace
at
fredrickshafen
behold
me
then
fresh
from
gegglingen
and
snags
in
the
immediate
presence
of
royalty
but
this
king
was
not
at
all
kingly
though
decidedly
stiff
he
is
however
rather
amusing
sometimes
as
when
by
his
order
issued
lately
he
compels
sentries
to
salute
even
empty
royal
carriages
i
got
a
newspaper
here
and
had
twelve
days
to
overtake
of
the
doings
while
we
had
roamed
in
hill
forest
and
waves
yet
i
had
been
always
asked
there
to
give
the
news
and
chiefly
on
two
points
the
great
eastern
with
its
electric
cable
and
the
catastrophe
on
the
matterhorn
glacier
the
two
being
at
times
vaguely
associated
as
if
the
breaking
of
the
cable
in
the
one
had
something
to
do
with
the
loss
of
mountaineers
in
the
other
so
while
i
read
the
train
bore
us
southwards
to
fredrickshafen
the
canoe
being
charged
as
baggage
three
shillings
and
patiently
submitting
to
have
a
numbered
label
pasted
on
its
pretty
brown
face
this
lively
port
on
the
north
side
of
the
lake
of
constance
has
a
charming
view
in
front
of
it
well
worth
stopping
to
enjoy
it
is
not
fair
to
treat
it
as
only
a
town
to
be
seen
while
you
are
waiting
for
the
lake
steamer
to
take
you
across
to
switzerland
but
now
i
come
to
it
for
a
sunday
rest
if
you
wish
to
travel
fast
and
far
rest
every
sunday
and
as
the
hotel
faced
the
station
and
the
lake
faced
the
hotel
this
is
the
very
place
to
stop
in
with
a
canoe
so
we
took
the
boat
upstairs
into
a
loft
where
the
washerwoman
not
only
gave
room
for
the
well
worked
timbers
of
the
rob
roy
to
be
safe
and
still
but
kindly
mended
my
sails
and
sundry
other
odds
and
ends
of
a
wardrobe
somewhat
disorganized
by
rough
times
next
day
there
was
service
in
the
protestant
church
a
fine
building
well
filled
and
duly
guarded
by
a
beadle
in
bright
array
the
service
began
by
a
woman
singing
comfort
ye
from
handel
in
exquisite
taste
and
simple
style
with
a
voice
that
made
one
forget
that
this
solemn
melody
is
usually
sung
by
a
man
then
a
large
number
of
school
children
were
ranged
in
the
chancel
round
a
crucifix
and
sang
a
very
beautiful
hymn
and
next
the
whole
congregation
joined
in
chanting
the
psalms
in
unison
with
tasteful
feeling
and
devoutness
a
young
german
preacher
gave
us
an
eloquent
sermon
and
then
the
people
were
dismissed
the
afternoon
was
drummed
away
by
two
noisy
bands
evidently
rivals
and
each
determined
to
excel
the
other
in
loudness
while
both
combined
to
persecute
the
poor
visitors
who
wish
for
quietness
at
any
rate
once
a
week
i
could
scarcely
escape
from
this
din
in
a
long
walk
by
the
lake
and
on
coming
back
found
a
man
bathing
by
moonlight
while
rockets
squibs
and
catherine
wheels
were
let
off
in
his
boat
better
indeed
was
it
to
look
with
entranced
eyes
on
the
far
off
snowy
range
now
lit
up
by
the
full
harvest
moon
and
on
the
sheen
of
each
particular
star
bright
above
and
bright
again
below
in
the
mirror
of
the
lake
the
lake
of
constance
is
miles
long
and
about
nine
miles
wide
i
could
not
see
a
ripple
there
when
the
rob
roy
was
launched
at
early
morn
with
my
mind
and
body
and
soul
refreshed
and
an
eager
longing
to
begin
the
tour
of
switzerland
once
more
but
now
in
so
new
a
fashion
soon
we
were
far
from
the
shore
and
in
that
middle
distance
of
the
lake
where
all
sides
seem
equally
near
and
where
the
other
side
appears
never
to
get
any
nearer
as
you
go
on
here
in
the
middle
i
rested
for
a
while
and
the
sensation
then
was
certainly
new
beauty
was
everywhere
around
and
there
was
full
freedom
to
see
it
there
was
no
route
to
be
followed
no
road
not
even
a
track
on
the
water
no
hours
or
time
to
constrain
i
could
go
right
or
left
by
a
stroke
of
the
paddle
and
i
was
utterly
my
own
master
of
whither
to
steer
and
where
to
stop
the
of
a
steamer
wheels
was
the
only
sound
and
that
was
very
distant
and
when
the
boat
came
near
the
passengers
cheered
the
canoe
and
smiles
of
was
it
not
envy
told
of
how
pleasant
and
pretty
she
looked
after
a
little
wavering
in
my
plans
i
settled
it
was
best
to
go
to
the
swiss
side
and
after
coasting
by
the
villages
i
selected
a
little
inn
in
a
retired
bay
and
moored
my
boat
and
ordered
breakfast
here
was
an
old
man
of
landlord
and
waiter
in
one
a
venerable
man
and
i
respect
age
more
while
growing
older
he
talked
with
me
for
five
hours
while
i
ate
read
and
sketched
and
feasted
my
eyes
on
mountain
views
and
answered
vaguely
to
his
remarks
said
in
a
sleepy
way
and
in
a
hot
quiet
basking
sun
there
are
peaceful
and
almost
dreamy
hours
of
rest
in
this
water
tour
and
they
are
sweet
too
after
hard
toil
it
is
not
all
rapids
and
struggles
when
you
journey
with
a
canoe
close
to
the
inn
was
the
idiot
asylum
an
old
castle
with
poor
demented
women
in
it
the
little
flag
of
my
boat
attracted
their
attention
and
all
the
inmates
were
allowed
to
come
out
and
see
it
with
many
smiles
of
pleasure
and
many
odd
remarks
and
gestures
disentangling
myself
from
this
strange
group
i
landed
again
further
down
and
under
a
splendid
tree
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
work
for
i
had
a
few
tools
on
board
to
repair
the
boat
damages
and
to
brighten
her
up
a
bit
for
the
english
eyes
i
must
expect
in
the
next
part
of
the
voyage
not
a
wave
had
energy
to
rise
on
the
lake
in
the
hot
sun
a
tinkled
now
and
then
but
in
a
tired
listless
and
irregular
way
a
gossamer
spider
had
spun
his
web
from
my
mast
to
the
tree
above
and
wagtails
hopped
near
me
on
the
stones
and
turned
an
inquiring
little
eye
to
the
boat
half
in
the
water
and
its
master
reclining
on
the
grass
it
was
an
easy
paddle
from
this
to
the
town
of
constance
at
the
end
of
the
lake
here
a
made
a
descent
upon
me
and
was
inexorable
you
have
the
boat
examined
very
well
pray
examine
it
his
chief
was
absent
and
i
must
put
the
canoe
in
the
till
morning
an
hour
was
wasted
in
palaver
about
this
and
at
first
i
protested
vigorously
against
such
absurdity
in
free
switzerland
but
constance
is
not
in
switzerland
it
is
in
the
grand
duchy
of
baden
and
so
to
keep
it
grand
they
must
do
very
little
things
and
at
any
rate
can
trouble
travellers
at
length
an
obliging
native
ashamed
of
the
proceeding
remonstrated
with
the
douanier
and
persuaded
him
at
least
to
search
the
boat
and
let
it
pass
he
took
as
much
time
to
inspect
as
if
she
were
a
brig
of
tons
and
when
he
came
to
look
at
the
stern
i
gravely
pointed
to
a
round
hole
cut
in
the
partition
for
this
very
purpose
into
this
hole
he
peered
while
the
crowd
was
hushed
in
silence
and
as
he
saw
nothing
but
darkness
extremely
dark
for
nothing
else
was
there
he
solemnly
pronounced
the
canoe
free
and
she
was
duly
borne
to
the
hotel
but
constance
once
had
a
man
in
it
who
was
really
grand
john
huss
the
noble
martyr
for
the
truth
in
the
council
hall
you
see
the
veritable
cell
in
which
he
was
imprisoned
some
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
on
a
former
visit
i
had
seen
from
the
tower
through
a
telescope
the
field
where
the
faggots
burned
him
and
from
whence
his
great
soul
leaped
up
to
heaven
out
of
the
blazing
pile
avenge
o
lord
thy
slaughtered
saints
whose
bones
lie
scattered
on
the
alpine
mountains
cold
them
who
kept
thy
truth
so
pure
of
old
when
all
our
fathers
worshipped
stocks
and
stones
does
not
a
thought
or
two
on
such
great
things
make
other
common
things
look
small
true
and
good
but
we
may
not
stop
always
in
the
lake
to
ponder
thus
for
the
current
is
moving
again
so
let
us
launch
the
rob
roy
on
our
old
friend
the
rhine
it
is
a
change
to
cross
a
quiet
lake
after
being
hurried
on
a
rapid
stream
like
the
danube
and
now
it
is
another
change
to
paddle
from
the
lake
into
a
wide
river
like
the
rhine
which
speeds
fast
and
steady
among
lively
scenes
the
water
is
deep
and
of
a
faint
blue
but
clear
enough
to
show
what
is
below
the
pebbly
bottom
seems
to
roll
towards
you
from
underneath
and
village
churches
appear
to
spin
quietly
round
on
the
banks
for
the
land
and
its
things
seem
to
move
not
the
water
so
glassy
its
surface
steadily
flowing
here
are
the
fishers
again
slowly
paying
out
their
nets
and
there
is
a
built
on
four
piles
in
the
river
the
target
itself
is
a
great
cube
of
wood
say
six
feet
on
each
side
it
is
fired
at
from
another
hut
perched
also
on
post
in
the
water
and
a
marker
safely
placed
behind
the
great
block
of
wood
turns
it
round
on
a
vertical
pivot
and
so
patches
up
the
and
indicates
its
position
to
those
who
have
fired
the
rhine
suddenly
narrows
soon
after
leaving
the
boden
see
or
lake
constance
as
we
call
it
but
the
banks
again
open
out
till
it
is
a
mile
or
two
in
breadth
here
and
there
are
grassy
islands
and
you
may
notice
by
long
stakes
stuck
on
the
shallows
which
tremble
as
the
water
presses
them
that
the
channel
for
steamers
is
very
roundabout
though
the
canoe
will
skim
over
any
part
of
it
comfortably
behind
each
islet
of
tall
reeds
there
is
a
held
fast
by
two
poles
stuck
in
the
bottom
of
the
river
or
it
is
noiselessly
moving
to
a
more
lucky
pool
sculled
by
the
boatman
with
his
oar
at
only
one
side
rather
a
novel
plan
while
he
pays
out
the
net
with
his
other
hand
barges
are
afloat
and
seem
to
turn
round
helplessly
in
the
current
of
the
deeper
parts
or
hoist
their
great
square
sails
in
the
dead
calm
perhaps
for
the
appearance
of
the
thing
a
very
picturesque
appearance
as
the
sail
has
two
broad
bands
of
dark
blue
cloth
for
its
centre
stripes
but
the
pointed
lateen
sail
of
geneva
is
certainly
a
more
graceful
rig
than
the
lug
especially
when
there
are
two
masts
and
the
white
sails
swell
towards
you
goosewinged
before
a
flowing
breeze
the
river
has
probably
a
very
uneven
bottom
in
this
part
for
the
water
sometimes
rushes
round
in
great
whirlpools
and
strange
overturnings
of
itself
as
if
it
were
boiling
from
below
in
exuberant
volume
with
a
gushing
upwards
and
then
again
it
wheels
about
in
a
circle
with
a
sweep
far
around
before
it
settles
to
go
xvi
xvi
these
maelstroms
seem
at
first
to
demand
extra
caution
as
you
approach
but
they
are
harmless
enough
for
the
water
is
deep
and
it
only
twists
the
boat
round
and
you
need
not
mind
this
except
when
the
sail
is
up
but
have
a
care
that
you
are
not
taken
aback
in
crossing
one
of
these
whirlpools
at
full
speed
it
will
be
found
needless
to
try
to
counteract
the
sudden
action
on
your
bow
by
paddling
against
it
for
it
is
better
to
hold
on
as
if
there
were
no
interference
and
presently
the
action
in
the
reverse
direction
puts
all
quite
straight
on
the
borders
of
switzerland
the
german
and
french
tongues
are
both
generally
known
at
the
hotels
and
by
the
people
accustomed
to
do
business
with
foreigners
travelling
among
them
but
in
your
course
along
a
river
these
convenient
waiters
and
polyglot
commissionaires
are
not
found
exactly
in
attendance
at
every
village
and
it
is
therefore
to
the
bystanders
or
casual
loungers
your
observations
must
be
addressed
frequent
intercourse
with
natives
of
strange
countries
where
there
is
no
common
language
between
them
and
the
tourist
will
gradually
teach
him
a
sign
language
which
suits
all
people
alike
thus
in
any
place
no
matter
what
was
their
dialect
it
was
always
easy
to
induce
one
or
two
men
to
aid
in
carrying
the
canoe
the
for
this
was
something
in
the
following
style
i
first
got
the
boat
on
shore
and
a
crowd
of
course
soon
collected
while
i
arranged
its
interior
and
sponged
out
the
splashed
water
and
fastened
the
cover
down
then
tightening
my
belt
for
a
walk
i
looked
round
with
a
kind
smile
and
selecting
a
likely
man
would
address
him
in
english
deliberately
as
follows
suiting
each
action
to
the
word
for
i
have
always
found
that
sign
language
is
made
more
natural
when
you
speak
your
own
tongue
all
the
time
you
are
acting
well
now
i
think
as
you
have
looked
on
enough
and
have
seen
all
you
want
it
about
time
to
go
to
an
hotel
a
here
you
yes
just
take
that
end
of
the
boat
up
so
gently
all
right
yes
under
your
arm
like
this
now
march
off
to
the
best
hotel
illustration
langsam
then
the
procession
naturally
formed
itself
the
most
humorous
boys
of
course
took
precedence
because
of
services
or
mischief
willing
to
be
performed
and
meanwhile
they
gratuitously
danced
about
and
under
the
canoe
like
fauns
around
silenus
women
only
came
near
and
waited
modestly
till
the
throng
had
passed
the
seniors
of
the
place
kept
on
the
safer
confines
of
the
movement
where
dignity
of
gait
might
comport
with
close
observation
in
a
case
of
sign
talking
like
the
foregoing
you
can
be
helped
by
one
substantive
and
one
adverb
and
if
you
pronounce
these
clearly
and
use
them
correctly
while
all
the
other
expressions
are
evidently
language
and
not
theirs
they
will
understand
it
much
better
than
if
you
try
signs
in
dumb
show
or
say
the
whole
in
bad
german
and
so
give
rise
to
all
possible
mistakes
of
your
meaning
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
when
you
have
forgotten
or
have
never
acquired
the
foreign
word
for
the
noun
you
wish
to
name
though
even
then
by
well
chosen
signs
and
among
an
intelligent
people
a
good
deal
can
be
conveyed
as
may
be
shown
in
the
following
cases
once
i
was
riding
among
the
arabs
along
the
algerian
coast
on
my
way
from
carthage
and
my
guide
a
dense
kabyle
was
evidently
taking
me
past
a
place
i
wished
to
visit
and
which
had
been
duly
entered
in
the
list
when
he
was
engaged
i
could
not
make
him
understand
this
for
my
limited
arabic
had
been
acquired
under
a
different
pronunciation
in
syria
but
one
night
it
happened
that
a
clever
chief
had
me
in
a
tent
or
rather
a
hut
just
like
the
top
of
a
gipsy
cart
i
explained
to
him
by
signs
and
talking
english
that
the
muleteer
was
taking
me
past
the
place
it
was
desired
to
see
then
i
tried
to
pronounce
the
name
of
that
place
but
was
always
wrong
or
he
could
not
make
it
out
it
was
maskutayn
or
bewitched
waters
a
wonderful
volcanic
valley
full
of
boiling
streams
and
little
volcanoes
of
salt
at
length
sitting
in
the
moonlight
signs
were
tried
even
for
this
difficult
occasion
i
put
my
chibouque
pipe
under
the
sand
and
took
water
in
my
hand
and
as
he
looked
on
intently
for
the
arabs
love
this
speaking
action
i
put
water
on
the
fire
in
the
and
blew
it
up
through
the
sand
talking
english
all
the
time
this
was
done
again
and
suddenly
the
black
lustrous
eyes
of
the
ishmaelite
glistened
brighter
he
slapped
his
forehead
he
jumped
up
you
could
almost
be
sure
he
said
i
know
it
now
and
then
he
roused
the
unfortunate
muleteer
from
his
snorings
to
give
him
an
energetic
lecture
by
means
of
which
we
were
directed
next
day
straight
to
the
very
place
i
desired
to
find
in
a
few
cases
of
this
international
talking
it
becomes
necessary
to
sketch
pictures
which
are
even
better
than
signs
but
not
among
arabs
during
a
visit
to
the
fair
of
nijni
novgorod
in
the
middle
of
russia
i
passed
many
hours
in
the
chinese
street
there
and
found
it
was
very
difficult
to
communicate
with
ching
loo
and
even
signs
were
useless
but
they
had
some
red
wax
about
the
and
there
was
a
white
wall
beside
us
so
upon
this
i
put
the
whole
story
in
large
pictures
with
an
explanatory
lecture
in
english
all
the
time
which
proceeding
attracted
an
audience
of
several
scores
of
chinamen
and
kalmuks
and
other
outlandish
people
and
the
particular
group
i
meant
to
enlighten
seemed
perfectly
to
understand
all
that
was
desired
and
so
we
suppose
that
if
you
can
work
your
paddle
well
and
learn
the
general
sign
language
and
a
little
of
the
pencil
tongue
you
can
go
very
far
in
a
canoe
without
being
starved
or
homeless
while
you
are
sure
to
have
a
wide
field
in
which
to
study
the
various
degrees
of
intelligence
among
those
you
meet
to
come
back
however
from
the
volga
to
the
rhine
the
current
flows
more
and
more
gently
as
we
enter
the
zeller
see
or
unter
see
a
lake
which
would
be
called
pretty
if
our
taste
has
not
been
sated
for
a
while
by
having
a
snowy
range
for
the
background
to
the
views
on
constance
but
the
lake
of
constance
sadly
wants
islands
and
here
in
the
zeller
see
are
several
one
of
them
being
of
great
size
the
emperor
of
the
french
had
passed
two
days
at
his
chateau
on
this
lake
just
before
we
arrived
no
doubt
he
would
have
waited
a
week
had
he
known
the
rob
roy
was
xvii
xvii
his
majesty
has
not
forgotten
the
canoe
as
will
be
seen
by
the
following
extract
from
the
paris
intelligence
in
the
globe
of
april
his
majesty
birthday
by
an
edict
dated
april
issued
this
morning
the
ministre
institutes
a
special
committee
for
the
organisation
of
a
special
exhibition
at
the
exposition
universelle
of
of
all
objects
connected
with
the
arts
and
industry
attached
to
pleasure
boats
and
river
navigation
this
measure
is
thought
to
display
the
importance
which
amateur
navigation
has
assumed
during
the
last
few
years
to
display
the
honour
in
which
is
held
this
as
it
is
denominated
in
the
report
and
to
be
successful
in
abolishing
the
old
and
absurd
prejudices
which
have
so
long
prevented
its
development
in
france
the
emperor
whose
fancy
for
imitating
everything
english
leads
him
to
patronise
with
alacrity
all
imitation
of
english
sports
in
particular
is
said
to
have
suggested
the
present
exhibition
after
reading
of
the
rob
roy
which
developes
many
new
ideas
of
the
purposes
besides
mere
pleasure
to
which
pleasure
boats
may
be
applied
and
would
be
glad
to
encourage
a
taste
for
the
exploration
of
solitary
streams
and
lonely
currents
amongst
the
youth
of
france
however
as
we
were
too
late
to
breakfast
with
his
majesty
i
pulled
in
at
the
village
of
steckborn
where
an
inn
is
built
on
the
actual
edge
of
the
water
a
state
of
things
most
convenient
for
the
aquatic
tourist
and
which
you
find
often
along
this
part
of
the
rhine
in
a
case
of
this
sort
you
can
tap
at
the
door
with
the
paddle
and
order
a
repast
before
you
debark
so
that
it
is
boiling
and
fizzing
and
the
table
is
all
ready
while
you
put
things
to
rights
on
board
and
come
leisurely
ashore
and
then
tie
the
boat
to
the
window
balcony
or
at
any
rate
in
some
place
where
it
can
be
seen
all
the
time
you
breakfast
or
dine
and
rest
and
read
and
draw
experience
proved
that
very
few
boys
even
of
the
most
mischievous
species
will
meddle
with
a
boat
which
is
floating
but
that
very
few
men
even
of
the
most
amiable
order
will
refrain
from
pulling
it
about
when
the
little
craft
is
left
on
shore
to
have
your
boat
not
only
moored
afloat
but
in
your
sight
too
that
is
perfection
and
it
is
worth
additional
trouble
to
arrange
this
because
then
and
for
hours
of
the
midday
stoppage
you
will
be
wholly
at
ease
or
at
any
rate
you
will
have
one
care
the
less
the
weary
resting
traveller
will
not
then
be
anxious
about
his
absent
boat
as
if
it
were
a
valuable
horse
in
a
strange
stable
the
landlord
was
much
interested
in
the
story
of
my
voyage
as
depicted
in
the
so
he
brought
a
friend
to
see
me
who
could
speak
french
and
who
had
himself
constructed
a
boat
of
two
tin
tubes
xviii
on
which
a
stage
or
frame
is
supported
with
a
seat
and
rowlocks
the
oddest
looking
thing
in
nautical
existence
i
persuaded
him
to
put
this
institution
into
the
water
and
we
started
for
a
cruise
the
metal
boat
with
its
gear
aloft
and
the
oak
canoe
so
low
and
rakish
with
its
varnished
cedar
deck
and
jaunty
flag
now
racing
side
by
side
each
of
them
a
rare
sight
but
the
two
together
quite
unprecedented
xviii
each
of
these
was
in
shape
like
the
cigar
ship
which
i
had
sailed
past
on
the
thames
and
which
has
since
been
launched
the
river
here
is
like
parts
of
the
clyde
and
the
kyles
of
bute
with
french
villages
let
in
and
an
italian
sky
stretched
overhead
we
rowed
across
to
a
village
where
a
number
of
jews
live
for
i
wished
to
visit
their
synagogue
but
lo
this
was
the
grand
duchy
of
baden
land
and
a
sentry
found
us
invading
the
dominion
so
he
deployed
and
formed
square
to
force
us
to
land
somewhere
else
the
man
was
civil
but
his
orders
were
unreasonable
so
we
merely
embarked
again
and
went
over
to
switzerland
and
ran
our
little
fleet
into
a
bramble
bush
to
hide
it
while
we
mounted
to
an
auberge
on
the
hill
for
a
sixpenny
bottle
of
wine
the
pretty
swiss
lass
in
charge
said
she
once
knew
an
englishman
but
it
was
a
pity
they
were
all
so
proud
he
had
sent
her
a
letter
in
english
which
i
asked
her
to
let
me
read
for
her
it
began
my
dear
little
girl
i
love
you
and
this
did
not
sound
so
very
proud
for
a
beginning
my
boating
friend
promised
to
make
her
a
tin
and
so
it
may
be
divined
that
he
was
the
tinman
of
the
village
and
a
most
agreeable
tinman
too
she
came
to
see
us
on
board
and
her
father
arrived
just
in
time
to
witness
a
triangular
parting
which
must
have
puzzled
him
a
good
deal
amelia
waving
farewell
to
a
proud
englishman
and
a
nautical
whitesmith
who
both
took
leave
also
of
each
other
the
last
sailing
away
with
huge
square
yards
and
coloured
canvas
and
the
rob
roy
drifting
with
the
stream
in
the
opposite
direction
every
day
for
weeks
past
had
been
as
a
picnic
to
me
but
i
prolonged
this
one
into
night
the
air
was
so
balmy
and
the
red
sun
setting
was
so
soon
replaced
by
the
white
moon
rising
and
besides
the
navigation
here
had
no
dangers
and
there
were
villages
every
few
miles
when
i
had
enough
of
it
cruising
here
and
there
by
moonlight
i
drew
up
to
the
town
of
stein
but
all
was
now
lonely
by
the
this
is
to
be
expected
when
you
arrive
late
however
a
slap
or
two
on
the
water
with
the
paddle
and
a
loud
verse
of
a
song
italian
dutch
a
pibroch
any
noise
in
fact
soon
draws
the
idlers
to
you
and
it
is
precisely
the
idlers
you
want
one
of
them
readily
helped
me
with
the
boat
to
an
inn
where
an
excellent
landlady
greeted
the
strange
guest
from
this
moment
all
was
bustle
there
and
very
much
it
was
increased
by
a
german
guest
who
insisted
on
talking
to
me
in
english
which
i
am
sure
i
did
not
understand
a
bit
better
than
the
germans
who
came
to
listen
and
look
on
chapter

fishing

in
the
morning
there
was
a
most
curious
change
of
air
all
around
was
in
a
dense
white
fog
truly
it
was
now
to
be
sensation
rowing
so
we
hastened
to
get
off
into
this
milky
atmosphere
i
have
an
idea
that
we
passed
under
a
bridge
at
least
the
usual
cheers
sounded
this
time
as
if
they
were
above
me
but
the
mist
was
as
thick
as
our
best
november
fogs
and
quite
as
interesting
on
several
occasions
i
positively
could
not
see
the
bow
of
my
boat
only
a
few
feet
from
my
nose
the
whole
arrangement
was
so
unexpected
and
entirely
novel
paddling
on
a
fast
invisible
stream
that
i
had
the
liveliest
emotions
of
pleasure
without
seeing
anything
at
all
but
then
fancy
had
free
play
all
the
time
and
the
pictures
it
drew
were
vivid
and
full
of
colour
and
after
all
our
impressions
of
external
objects
are
only
pictures
so
say
the
philosophers
and
why
not
then
enjoy
a
tour
in
a
fog
with
a
good
album
of
pictures
making
the
while
in
the
brain
sounds
too
there
were
but
like
those
of
witches
and
fairies
though
perhaps
it
was
only
the
cackling
of
some
antique
washerwomen
on
the
banks
however
i
addressed
the
unseen
company
in
both
prose
and
poetry
and
was
full
of
emphasis
which
now
and
again
was
increased
by
my
boat
running
straight
into
the
shore
the
clearing
away
of
the
fog
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
evolutions
of
nature
to
be
seen
in
one
sort
or
other
every
traveller
has
enjoyed
the
quick
or
gradual
tearing
up
of
a
fog
curtain
on
mountain
or
moor
but
here
it
was
on
a
beauteous
river
i
wish
to
describe
this
process
but
i
can
not
it
was
a
series
of
turner
pictures
with
glimpses
right
and
left
and
far
overhead
of
trees
sky
castles
each
lightened
and
shown
for
a
moment
and
then
gauzed
over
again
and
completely
hidden
while
the
mind
had
to
imagine
all
the
context
of
the
scenery
and
it
was
sure
to
be
quite
wrong
when
another
gleam
of
sun
disclosed
what
was
there
in
reality
for
it
cleared
away
at
last
and
father
sol
avenged
himself
by
an
extra
hot
ray
for
thus
trifling
with
his
beams
the
rhine
banks
here
were
sloping
but
steep
with
pleasant
meadows
vineyards
and
woods
mingled
with
tolerable
fairness
to
all
three
in
short
though
i
appreciate
scenery
with
an
eager
admiration
any
scenery
seemed
good
when
the
genial
exercise
of
the
canoe
was
the
medium
for
enjoying
it
soon
afterwards
the
woods
thickened
the
mountains
rose
behind
them
the
current
got
faster
and
faster
the
houses
at
first
dotted
on
the
knolls
got
closer
and
more
suburb
like
and
at
last
a
grand
sweep
of
the
stream
opened
up
schaffhausen
to
the
eye
while
a
sullen
sound
on
the
water
warned
of
rapids
ahead
as
i
intended
to
keep
them
always
in
front
some
caution
was
needed
in
steering
though
there
is
no
difficulty
here
for
steamboats
navigate
thus
far
and
of
course
it
is
easy
for
a
canoe
but
when
i
glided
down
to
the
bridge
there
was
the
goldenen
schiff
hotel
and
i
resolved
to
patronise
it
on
account
of
its
name
and
because
there
was
a
gigantic
picture
of
a
briton
on
the
adjoining
wall
he
was
in
full
highland
costume
though
the
peculiar
tartan
of
his
kilt
showed
that
there
is
still
one
clan
we
have
not
yet
recognised
here
began
a
novel
kind
of
astonishment
among
the
people
for
when
on
my
arrival
they
asked
where
have
you
come
from
and
were
told
from
england
they
could
not
understand
how
my
course
seemed
as
if
in
reality
from
germany
the
short
morning
work
being
soon
over
there
was
all
the
day
before
me
to
wander
about
drums
and
a
band
presently
led
me
to
a
corps
of
little
boys
in
full
uniform
about
of
them
all
with
real
guns
and
with
boy
officers
most
martial
to
behold
albeit
they
were
munching
apples
between
the
words
of
command
and
pulling
wry
faces
at
urchins
of
eight
years
old
who
strove
in
vain
to
take
long
steps
with
short
legs
they
had
some
skirmishing
drill
and
used
small
goats
horns
to
give
the
orders
instead
of
bugles
these
horns
are
used
on
the
railways
too
and
the
note
is
very
clear
and
may
be
heard
well
a
long
way
off
indeed
i
think
much
might
be
done
in
our
drill
at
home
by
something
of
this
sort
it
is
a
short
three
miles
to
the
belle
vue
built
above
the
falls
of
schaffhausen
and
in
full
view
of
this
noble
scene
these
great
falls
of
the
rhine
looked
much
finer
than
i
had
recollected
them
some
twelve
years
before
it
is
pleasant
but
unusual
for
one
second
visit
to
such
sights
to
be
more
striking
than
the
first
at
night
the
river
was
splendidly
illuminated
by
bengal
lights
of
different
colours
and
the
effect
of
this
on
the
tossing
foam
and
rich
full
body
of
ever
pouring
water
or
fire
as
it
then
seemed
to
be
was
to
present
a
spectacle
of
magical
beauty
and
grandeur
well
seen
from
the
balcony
of
the
hotel
by
many
travellers
from
various
lands
on
one
side
of
me
was
a
russian
and
a
brazilian
on
the
other
next
day
at
the
i
put
the
sharp
bow
of
the
rob
roy
in
at
the
window
of
the
baggages
office
and
asked
for
the
ticket
the
clerk
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
for
he
knew
i
was
an
englishman
and
nothing
is
too
odd
queer
mad
in
short
for
englishmen
to
do
but
the
porters
guards
and
made
a
good
deal
of
talk
before
the
canoe
was
safely
stowed
among
the
trunks
in
the
van
and
i
now
and
then
visited
her
there
just
for
company
sake
and
to
see
that
the
boxes
of
the
american
tourists
had
not
broken
holes
in
her
oaken
skin
one
could
not
but
survey
with
some
anxiety
the
lumbering
casks
on
the
platform
waiting
to
be
rolled
in
beside
the
canoe
and
the
fish
baskets
iron
bars
crates
and
clumsy
gear
of
all
sorts
which
at
every
stoppage
is
tumbled
in
or
roughly
shovelled
out
of
the
of
a
train
this
care
and
sympathy
for
a
mere
boat
may
be
called
enthusiasm
by
those
who
have
not
felt
the
like
towards
inanimate
objects
linked
to
our
pleasures
or
pains
by
hourly
ties
of
interest
but
others
will
understand
how
a
friendship
for
the
boat
was
felt
more
every
day
i
journeyed
with
her
her
strong
points
were
better
known
as
they
were
more
tried
but
the
weak
points
too
of
the
frail
traveller
became
now
more
apparent
and
the
desire
to
bring
her
safely
to
england
was
rapidly
increased
when
we
had
made
the
homeward
turn
the
mere
cost
of
the
railway
ticket
for
the
boat
carriage
to
zurich
was
two
or
three
shillings
not
so
much
as
the
expense
of
taking
it
between
the
stations
and
the
hotels
submitting
then
to
be
borne
again
on
wheels
and
through
tunnels
in
the
good
old
railway
style
we
soon
arrive
among
the
regular
swiss
mountains
and
where
gather
the
swiss
tourists
for
whom
arise
the
swiss
hotels
those
huge
establishments
founded
and
managed
so
as
best
to
fatten
on
the
wandering
englishman
and
to
give
him
homoeopathic
feeding
while
his
purse
is
bled
for
suffer
me
again
to
have
a
little
gossip
about
yes
it
is
a
mundane
subject
and
undoubtedly
physical
but
when
the
traveller
has
to
move
his
body
and
baggage
along
a
route
by
his
own
muscles
by
climbing
or
by
rowing
or
by
whipping
a
mule
it
is
a
matter
of
high
moment
to
him
at
least
that
fibrine
should
be
easily
procurable
if
you
wish
then
to
live
well
in
switzerland
and
germany
go
to
german
hotels
and
avoid
the
grand
barracks
reared
on
every
for
the
english
tourist
see
how
the
omnibus
from
the
train
or
the
steamer
pours
down
its
victims
into
the
landlords
arms
papa
and
mamma
and
three
daughters
and
a
maid
well
of
course
will
be
attended
to
here
is
another
timid
lady
with
an
alpenstock
a
long
white
cane
people
get
when
they
arrive
in
switzerland
and
which
they
never
know
what
on
earth
to
do
with
next
there
will
issue
from
the
same
vehicle
a
dozen
londoners
and
the
whole
party
men
and
women
are
so
demure
so
afraid
of
themselves
that
the
does
just
what
he
likes
with
them
every
one
without
a
courier
a
wife
heavy
baggage
or
young
ladies
i
enter
too
and
dare
to
order
a
cutlet
and
potatoes
after
two
chops
come
and
spinach
each
just
one
bite
and
cold
i
ask
for
fruit
and
some
pears
are
presented
that
grate
on
the
knife
with
a
minute
bunch
of
grapes
good
ones
let
us
acknowledge
for
this
we
pay
next
day
i
row
three
miles
down
the
lake
and
order
just
as
before
a
cutlet
potatoes
and
fruit
but
this
time
at
a
german
inn
presently
behold
two
luscious
veal
cutlets
with
splendid
potatoes
and
famous
hot
plates
and
a
teeming
gracefully
with
large
clusters
of
magnificent
grapes
peaches
pears
all
gushing
with
juice
and
mellow
apples
and
rosy
plums
for
this
i
pay
the
secret
is
that
the
germans
wo
pay
the
prices
which
the
english
fear
to
grumble
at
and
wo
put
up
with
the
articles
the
english
fear
to
refuse
nor
may
we
blame
the
for
their
part
in
this
business
they
try
to
make
as
much
money
as
they
can
and
most
people
who
are
making
money
try
to
do
the
same
in
the
twilight
the
rob
roy
launched
on
the
lake
of
zurich
so
lovely
by
evening
cool
and
calm
with
its
pretty
villages
painted
again
on
the
water
below
and
soft
voices
singing
and
slow
music
floating
in
the
air
as
the
moon
looked
down
and
the
crests
of
snow
were
silvered
on
hills
the
canoe
was
now
put
up
in
a
boathouse
where
all
seemed
to
be
secure
it
was
the
only
time
i
had
found
a
boathouse
for
my
boat
and
the
only
time
when
she
was
badly
treated
for
next
morning
though
the
man
in
charge
appeared
to
be
a
solid
honest
fellow
i
saw
at
once
that
the
canoe
had
been
sadly
tumbled
about
and
filled
with
water
the
seat
cast
off
and
floating
outside
the
covering
deranged
the
sails
untied
and
the
sacred
paddle
defiled
by
clumsy
hands
the
man
who
suffered
this
to
be
perpetrated
will
not
soon
forget
the
he
received
with
a
and
i
shall
not
forget
in
future
to
observe
the
practice
of
carrying
the
canoe
invariably
into
the
hotel
another
piece
of
experience
gained
here
was
this
that
to
send
your
luggage
on
by
a
steamer
intending
to
regain
it
on
your
arrival
adds
far
less
of
convenience
than
it
does
of
anxiety
and
trouble
seeing
that
in
this
sort
of
travel
you
can
readily
take
the
baggage
with
you
always
and
everywhere
in
your
boat
much
of
the
charm
of
next
day
paddle
on
the
lake
consisted
in
its
perfect
independence
of
all
previous
arrangements
and
in
the
absence
of
such
thraldom
as
you
must
be
here
by
ten
or
you
have
to
sleep
there
at
night
so
now
let
the
wind
blow
as
it
likes
i
could
run
before
it
and
breakfast
at
this
village
or
cross
to
that
point
to
bathe
or
row
round
that
bay
and
lunch
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
or
anywhere
else
on
the
shore
or
in
the
boat
itself
as
i
pleased
i
felt
as
a
dog
must
feel
on
his
travels
who
has
no
luggage
and
no
collar
and
has
only
one
coat
which
always
fits
him
and
is
always
getting
new
when
quite
sated
with
the
water
i
fixed
on
horgen
to
stop
at
for
a
rest
to
the
intense
delight
of
all
the
horgen
boys
how
they
did
jump
and
caper
about
the
canoe
and
scream
with
the
glee
of
young
hearts
stirred
by
a
new
sight
it
was
one
of
the
great
treats
of
this
voyage
to
find
it
gave
such
hours
of
pleasure
to
the
juvenile
population
in
each
place
along
the
vista
of
my
recollection
as
i
think
over
the
past
days
of
this
excursion
many
thousand
childish
faces
brimming
with
happiness
range
their
chubby
or
not
chubby
cheeks
these
young
friends
were
still
more
joyous
when
the
boat
was
put
into
a
cart
and
the
driver
got
up
beside
it
and
the
captain
of
the
canoe
began
his
hot
walk
behind
a
number
of
their
mammas
came
out
to
smile
on
the
performance
and
some
asked
to
have
a
passage
to
england
in
the
boat
to
which
there
was
the
stock
reply
given
day
by
day
not
much
room
for
the
crinoline
only
once
was
there
the
rejoinder
that
the
lady
would
willingly
leave
her
expansion
at
home
though
on
another
occasion
and
that
in
france
too
they
answered
we
poor
folks
do
wear
crinoline
in
every
group
there
were
various
forms
of
inquisitiveness
about
the
canoe
first
those
who
examined
it
without
putting
questions
and
then
those
who
questioned
about
it
without
examining
some
lifted
it
to
feel
the
weight
others
passed
their
hands
along
its
smooth
deck
to
feel
the
polished
cedar
others
looked
underneath
to
see
if
there
was
a
keel
or
bent
the
rope
to
feel
how
flexible
it
was
or
poised
the
paddle
when
i
let
them
and
said
how
light
and
then
more
critical
inquirers
measured
the
boat
dimensions
tapped
its
sides
with
their
knuckles
and
looked
wise
sketched
its
form
scrutinized
its
copper
nails
or
gently
touched
the
silken
flag
with
its
frayed
hem
and
colour
fading
now
in
all
places
this
last
item
as
an
object
of
interest
was
always
the
first
exclaimed
about
by
the
lady
portion
of
the
crowd
it
is
with
such
little
but
pleasant
trivialities
that
a
traveller
day
may
be
filled
in
this
enchanting
atmosphere
where
simply
to
exist
to
breathe
to
gaze
and
to
listen
are
enough
to
pass
the
sunny
hours
if
not
to
engage
the
nobler
powers
of
the
mind
the
lakes
of
zurich
and
zug
are
not
far
separate
about
three
hours
of
steady
road
walking
takes
you
from
one
to
the
other
over
a
high
neck
of
forest
land
and
a
hot
walk
this
was
from
twelve
to
three
in
the
brightest
hours
of
the
day
the
heat
and
the
dust
made
me
eager
again
to
be
afloat
by
the
map
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
one
could
row
part
of
this
way
on
a
river
which
runs
into
zug
but
maps
are
no
guidance
as
to
the
fitness
of
streams
for
a
boat
they
make
a
black
line
wriggling
about
on
the
paper
do
for
all
rivers
alike
and
this
tells
you
nothing
as
to
the
depth
or
force
of
the
current
nor
can
the
drivers
or
innkeepers
tell
much
more
since
they
have
no
particular
reason
for
observing
how
a
river
comports
itself
their
business
is
on
the
road
the
driver
was
proud
of
his
unusual
fare
a
boat
with
an
english
flag
and
he
gave
a
short
account
of
it
to
every
friend
he
met
an
account
no
doubt
frightfully
exaggerated
but
always
accepted
as
sufficient
by
the
gratified
listener
the
worthy
carter
however
was
quite
annoyed
that
i
stopped
him
outside
the
town
of
zug
paying
thirteen
francs
for
the
cart
for
i
wished
to
get
the
canoe
into
the
water
unobserved
as
the
morning
work
had
left
me
yet
no
rest
and
sweet
repose
could
best
be
had
by
floating
in
my
boat
however
there
was
no
evading
the
townspeople
desire
to
see
the
schiff
in
a
cart
from
england
we
took
her
behind
a
clump
of
stones
but
they
climbed
upon
the
stones
and
stood
i
sat
down
in
a
moody
silence
but
they
sat
down
too
in
respectful
patience
i
tried
then
another
plan
turned
the
canoe
bottom
upward
and
began
lining
a
seam
of
the
planks
with
red
putty
they
looked
on
till
it
was
done
and
i
began
the
same
seam
again
and
told
them
that
all
the
other
seams
must
be
thus
lined
this
at
last
was
too
much
for
some
of
the
wiser
ones
who
turned
away
and
murmured
about
my
slowness
but
others
at
once
took
their
places
in
the
front
row
it
seemed
unfriendly
to
go
on
thus
any
longer
and
as
it
was
cooler
now
i
pushed
the
boat
into
the
lake
shipped
my
luggage
on
board
and
after
the
usual
english
speech
to
them
all
from
the
water
bid
every
one
xix
xix
this
word
like
other
expressive
french
words
is
commonly
used
in
germany
and
switzerland
new
vigour
came
when
once
the
paddle
was
grasped
again
and
the
soft
yielding
water
and
gentle
heaving
on
its
bosom
had
fresh
pleasure
now
after
the
dusty
road
it
seems
as
if
one
must
be
for
ever
spoiled
for
land
travel
by
this
smooth
liquid
journeying
zug
is
a
little
lake
and
the
mountains
are
over
it
only
at
one
end
but
then
there
are
glorious
hills
the
rigi
and
a
hundred
more
each
behind
another
or
raising
a
peak
in
the
gaps
between
i
must
resolutely
abstain
from
describing
these
here
the
sight
of
them
is
well
known
to
the
traveller
the
painted
pictures
of
them
in
every
shop
window
are
faithful
enough
for
those
who
have
not
been
nearer
and
words
can
tell
very
little
to
others
of
what
is
seen
and
felt
when
you
fill
the
delighted
eye
by
looking
on
the
snowy
range
near
one
end
of
the
lake
i
visited
the
line
of
targets
where
the
switzers
were
popping
away
their
little
bullets
at
their
short
ranges
with
all
sorts
of
gimcrack
instruments
to
aid
them
lenses
crooks
and
straps
for
the
arms
and
everything
done
under
cover
too
very
skilful
indeed
are
they
in
the
use
of
these
contrivances
but
the
weapons
look
like
after
all
and
are
only
one
step
removed
from
the
crossbows
you
see
in
belgium
and
france
where
men
meet
to
shoot
at
stuffed
cockrobins
fixed
on
a
pole
and
do
not
hit
them
and
then
adjourn
for
beer
the
swiss
are
good
shots
and
brave
men
and
woe
be
to
their
invaders
still
in
this
matter
of
rifle
shooting
their
practice
through
a
window
at
the
short
range
of
yards
seems
really
childish
when
compared
with
that
of
the
manly
groups
at
wimbledon
where
on
the
open
heath
in
sun
or
drifting
hail
the
burly
yorkshireman
meets
with
the
hardy
scot
and
sends
his
heavier
deadly
bullet
on
its
swift
errand
right
away
for
a
thousand
yards
in
the
storm
leaving
the
shooters
to
their
bulls
eyes
i
paddled
in
front
of
the
town
to
scan
the
hotels
and
to
judge
of
the
best
by
appearances
out
came
the
boats
of
zug
to
examine
the
floating
stranger
they
went
round
and
round
in
a
criticising
mood
just
as
local
dogs
strut
slowly
in
circles
about
a
cur
who
is
not
known
to
their
street
and
besides
is
of
ambiguous
breed
these
boats
were
all
larger
than
mine
and
most
of
them
were
brighter
with
plenty
of
paint
and
universally
they
were
encumbered
with
most
awkward
oars
a
courteous
frenchman
in
one
of
the
boats
told
me
all
the
zug
news
in
a
breath
besides
asking
numerous
questions
and
giving
a
hasty
commentary
on
the
fishing
in
the
lake
finally
he
pointed
out
the
best
hotel
and
so
the
naval
squadron
advanced
to
the
pier
led
by
the
canoe
a
gracious
landlady
here
put
my
boat
safe
in
the
hotel
coachhouse
and
offered
to
give
me
the
key
of
the
padlock
to
make
sure
in
the
à
were
some
english
friends
from
london
so
now
i
felt
that
here
was
an
end
of
lone
wanderings
among
foreigners
for
the
summer
stream
of
tourists
from
england
was
encountered
at
this
point
an
early
start
next
morning
found
the
mists
on
the
mountains
but
they
were
quickly
furled
up
out
of
the
way
in
festoons
like
muslin
curtains
we
skirted
the
pretty
villas
on
the
verge
of
the
lake
and
hauled
in
by
some
to
rig
up
the
sails
this
could
be
done
more
easily
when
the
boat
was
drawn
ashore
than
when
it
was
afloat
though
after
practice
i
could
not
only
set
the
mast
and
hoist
the
sails
at
sea
but
could
even
stand
up
and
change
my
coat
or
tie
the
flag
on
the
masthead
or
survey
a
difficult
channel
while
the
boat
was
rocking
on
the
waves
of
a
xx
xx
this
is
so
very
useful
in
extending
the
horizon
of
view
and
in
enabling
you
to
examine
a
whole
ledge
of
sunken
rocks
at
once
that
it
is
well
worth
the
trouble
of
a
week
or
two
practice
sailing
on
a
lake
in
switzerland
is
a
full
reward
for
carrying
your
mast
and
sails
unused
for
many
a
long
mile
sometimes
indeed
the
sails
seemed
to
be
after
all
an
encumbrance
but
this
was
when
they
were
not
available
every
time
they
came
into
use
again
the
satisfaction
of
having
brought
them
was
reassured
in
sailing
while
the
wind
is
light
you
need
not
always
sit
as
must
be
done
for
paddling
wafted
by
the
breeze
you
can
now
recline
lie
down
or
lie
up
put
your
legs
anyhow
and
anywhere
in
the
water
if
you
like
and
the
peak
of
the
sail
is
a
shade
between
the
sun
and
your
eyes
while
the
ripples
seem
to
tinkle
cheerfully
against
the
bow
and
the
wavelets
seethe
by
smoothly
near
the
stern
when
you
are
under
sail
the
hill
tops
look
higher
than
before
for
now
you
see
how
far
they
are
above
your
lofty
masthead
and
the
black
rocks
on
the
shore
look
blacker
when
seen
in
contrast
with
a
sail
like
cream
illustration
sailing
on
lake
zug
after
a
cruise
that
left
nothing
more
to
see
of
zug
we
put
into
port
at
imyn
and
though
it
is
a
little
place
only
a
few
houses
the
boys
there
were
as
troublesome
as
gnats
buzzing
about
so
the
canoe
had
to
be
locked
in
the
stable
out
of
sight
three
britons
were
waiting
here
for
the
steamer
they
had
come
to
fish
in
switzerland
now
fishing
and
travelling
kill
each
other
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
unless
one
of
them
is
used
as
a
because
you
can
not
go
on
with
the
other
thus
i
recollect
once
at
the
town
of
vossevangen
in
norway
when
we
had
to
wait
some
hours
for
horses
it
was
capital
fun
to
catch
three
trout
with
a
pin
for
a
hook
fastened
on
the
lash
of
a
while
a
shot
with
a
pistol
at
my
glengarry
cap
on
a
stone
the
true
fisherman
fishes
for
the
fishing
not
for
the
fishes
he
himself
is
pleased
even
if
he
catches
nothing
though
he
is
more
pleased
to
bring
back
a
full
basket
for
that
will
justify
him
to
his
friends
now
when
you
stop
your
travelling
that
you
may
angle
if
you
catch
nothing
you
grudge
the
day
spent
and
keep
thinking
how
much
you
might
have
seen
in
it
on
the
road
on
the
other
hand
if
you
do
happen
to
catch
one
or
two
fish
you
do
like
to
leave
the
place
where
more
might
be
taken
and
your
first
ten
miles
after
departure
from
it
is
a
stage
of
reflection
about
pools
stones
bites
and
rises
instead
of
what
is
going
on
all
around
worst
of
all
if
you
have
hooked
a
fish
and
lost
him
it
is
a
sad
confession
of
defeat
then
to
give
up
the
sport
and
moodily
resume
the
tour
as
for
the
three
visitors
at
imyn
they
had
just
twenty
minutes
sure
so
they
breakfasted
in
five
minutes
and
in
the
next
three
minutes
had
got
their
rods
ready
and
were
out
in
the
garden
casting
as
fast
as
possible
and
flogging
the
water
as
if
the
fish
also
ought
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
taken
the
hot
sun
blazed
upon
the
bald
head
of
one
of
these
excited
anglers
for
he
had
not
time
to
put
on
his
hat
the
other
had
got
his
line
entangled
in
a
bush
and
of
course
was
de
the
third
was
a
sort
of
light
skirmisher
rushing
about
with
advice
and
pointing
out
shoals
of
minnows
everywhere
else
but
where
his
companions
were
engaged
however
they
managed
to
capture
a
few
monsters
of
the
deep
that
is
to
say
a
couple
of
misguided
gudgeons
probably
dissipated
members
of
their
tribe
and
late
risers
who
had
missed
their
proper
breakfasts
ardent
as
i
am
with
the
rod
i
could
not
enjoy
fishing
after
this
sort
to
be
in
this
tide
of
wandering
britons
and
yet
to
look
at
them
and
listen
to
them
as
if
you
were
distinct
this
is
a
post
full
of
interest
and
amusement
and
if
you
can
even
for
one
day
try
to
be
at
least
in
thought
a
swiss
resident
or
a
parisian
and
so
to
regard
the
english
around
you
from
the
point
they
are
seen
from
by
the
foreigners
whom
they
visit
the
examination
becomes
far
more
curious
but
this
has
been
done
by
many
clever
tourists
who
have
written
their
notes
with
more
or
less
humour
and
with
more
rather
than
less
severity
so
i
shall
not
attempt
to
analyse
the
strange
atoms
of
the
flood
from
our
islands
which
overflows
the
continent
every
year
it
is
the
fashion
to
decry
of
this
motley
company
as
snobs
spendthrifts
or
greenhorns
with
humble
but
firm
voice
i
protest
against
this
unfairness
nor
can
i
help
thinking
that
much
of
the
hard
criticism
published
by
travellers
against
their
fellows
is
a
crooked
way
of
saying
what
it
does
not
do
to
assert
directly
that
the
writer
has
at
any
rate
met
some
travellers
inferior
to
himself
of
course
among
the
englishmen
whom
i
met
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
this
voyage
there
were
some
strange
specimens
and
their
remarks
were
odd
enough
when
alluding
to
the
canoe
one
said
for
example
you
think
it
would
have
been
more
commodious
to
have
had
an
attendant
with
you
to
look
after
your
luggage
and
things
the
most
obvious
answer
to
this
was
probably
that
which
i
gave
not
for
me
if
he
was
to
be
in
the
boat
and
not
for
him
if
he
had
to
run
on
the
bank
another
englishman
at
home
asked
me
in
all
seriousness
about
the
canoe
voyage
was
it
not
a
great
waste
of
time
and
when
i
inquired
how
had
spent
his
vacation
he
said
oh
i
was
all
the
time
in
returning
once
more
to
english
conversation
one
is
reminded
how
very
useless
and
unpractical
are
all
the
published
to
facilitate
the
traveller
conversation
in
foreign
languages
whether
they
are
meant
to
help
you
in
french
german
italian
or
spanish
these
little
books
with
their
double
columns
of
words
and
phrases
and
their
polite
at
the
end
all
seem
to
be
equally
determined
to
force
words
upon
you
which
you
never
will
need
to
use
while
the
things
you
are
always
wanting
to
say
in
the
new
tongue
are
either
carefully
buried
among
colloquies
on
botany
or
precious
stones
or
among
philosophical
discussions
about
metaphysics
or
else
the
desirable
phrases
are
not
in
the
book
at
all
this
need
of
a
brief
and
good
struck
me
particularly
when
i
had
carefully
marked
in
my
german
one
all
the
pages
which
would
never
be
required
in
the
tour
so
that
i
could
cut
them
out
as
an
unnecessary
addition
to
the
weight
of
my
ship
library
why
the
little
book
when
thus
expurgated
got
so
lamentably
thin
that
the
few
pages
left
of
it
as
just
possible
to
be
useful
formed
only
a
wretched
skeleton
of
the
original
volume
another
fault
of
these
books
is
that
half
the
matter
in
them
is
made
up
of
what
the
imaginary
chatting
foreigner
says
the
unhappy
englishman
and
this
often
in
long
phrases
or
even
in
set
speeches
but
when
in
actual
life
the
real
foreigner
speaks
to
you
he
somehow
says
quite
a
different
set
of
words
from
any
particular
phrases
you
see
in
the
book
and
you
can
not
make
out
his
meaning
because
it
does
not
correspond
with
anything
you
have
learned
it
is
evident
that
a
dictionary
is
required
to
get
at
the
english
meaning
of
what
is
said
to
you
by
another
while
a
will
suffice
for
what
you
wish
to
say
to
him
because
you
can
select
in
it
and
compose
from
it
before
you
utter
any
particular
phrase
the
danish
for
norway
and
sweden
is
a
tolerably
good
one
and
it
holds
in
a
short
compass
all
the
traveller
wants
but
i
think
a
book
of
this
kind
for
each
of
the
other
principal
languages
might
well
be
constructed
on
the
following
basis
first
let
us
have
the
expression
i
want
and
then
the
english
substantives
most
used
in
travel
talk
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
and
with
their
foreign
equivalents
next
put
the
request
will
you
and
after
it
place
each
of
the
verbs
of
action
generally
required
by
travellers
then
set
forth
the
question
does
the
with
a
column
of
events
formed
by
a
noun
verb
and
preposition
in
each
such
as
coach
stop
at
road
lead
to
steamer
start
from
and
lastly
give
us
the
comprehensive
is
it
with
a
long
alphabetical
list
of
adjectives
likely
to
be
employed
under
these
four
heads
with
two
pages
of
adverbs
and
numerals
i
think
that
the
primary
communications
with
a
foreigner
can
be
comprised
and
as
for
conversations
with
him
on
special
subjects
such
as
politics
or
art
or
scenery
these
are
practically
not
likely
to
be
attempted
unless
you
learn
his
language
and
not
merely
some
of
its
most
necessary
but
this
study
of
language
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
you
get
a
having
now
delivered
a
homily
on
international
talking
it
is
time
to
be
on
the
move
again

seeburg
river
scenes
night
and
snow
the

a
dear
dinner
seeing
a
rope
passing
a
fall
bremgarten
rapids
when
the
steamer
at
imyn
had
embarked
the
three
sportsmen
and
the
little
pier
was
quiet
we
got
a
cart
out
for
the
rob
roy
and
bargained
to
have
it
rumbled
over
the
hill
to
the
lake
of
lucerne
for
the
sum
of
five
francs
it
is
only
walk
the
landlord
himself
came
as
driver
for
he
was
fully
interested
about
the
canoe
and
he
did
not
omit
to
let
people
know
his
sentiments
on
the
subject
all
along
the
way
even
calling
out
to
the
men
plucking
fruit
in
the
who
had
perhaps
failed
to
notice
the
phenomenon
which
was
passing
on
the
road
beneath
them
there
was
a
permanent
joke
on
such
occasions
and
oddly
enough
it
was
used
by
the
drivers
in
germany
as
well
as
in
switzerland
and
was
of
course
original
and
spontaneous
with
each
of
them
as
they
called
out
going
to
america
and
then
chuckled
at
the
brilliant
remark
the
village
we
came
to
on
lucerne
was
the
kussnacht
that
is
of
the
kussnachts
for
there
are
plenty
of
these
honeymoon
towns
in
central
europe
and
with
the
customary
assembly
of
eloquently
addressed
this
time
by
the
the
canoe
was
launched
on
another
lake
perhaps
the
prettiest
lake
in
the
world
like
other
people
and
at
other
times
i
had
traversed
this
beautiful
water
of
the
four
cantons
but
those
only
who
have
seen
it
well
by
steamer
and
by
walking
so
as
to
know
how
it
juts
in
and
winds
round
in
intricate
geography
can
imagine
how
much
better
you
may
follow
and
grasp
its
beauties
by
searching
them
out
alone
and
in
a
canoe
for
thus
i
could
penetrate
all
the
wooded
nooks
and
dwell
on
each
and
visit
the
rocky
islets
and
wait
long
longer
as
long
as
i
pleased
before
some
lofty
berg
while
the
gently
undulated
and
the
passing
cloud
shaded
the
hill
with
grey
and
the
red
flag
of
a
steamer
fluttered
in
a
distant
sunbeam
and
the
plash
of
a
barge
oar
broke
on
the
boatman
song
everything
around
changing
just
a
little
and
the
stream
of
inward
thought
and
admiration
changing
too
as
it
flowed
but
all
the
time
and
when
the
eye
came
back
to
it
again
there
was
the
grand
mountain
still
the
same
like
teneriffe
or
atlas
unremoved
how
cool
the
snow
looked
up
there
aloft
even
in
the
heat
of
summer
and
to
come
down
again
to
one
level
on
the
water
how
lively
the
steamer
was
with
the
music
of
its
band
and
the
quick
beat
of
its
wheels
curling
up
white
foam
let
us
speed
to
meet
it
and
to
get
a
tossing
in
the
swell
while
jones
and
smith
under
the
awning
cry
out
why
to
be
sure
that
the
rob
roy
canoe
and
jones
and
the
three
miss
smiths
all
lift
up
their
heads
from
their
murrays
where
they
have
been
diligently
reading
the
history
of
switzerland
from
and
then
the
description
in
words
of
all
the
scenery
around
although
they
have
suffered
its
speaking
realities
in
mountain
wood
and
lake
to
pass
unnoticed
as
i
was
quite
fresh
having
worked
chiefly
the
sails
on
zug
and
now
in
good
training
so
as
to
get
on
very
comfortably
with
ten
or
twelve
hours
rowing
in
the
day
i
spent
it
all
in
seeing
this
inexhaustible
lake
of
lucerne
and
yet
felt
that
at
least
a
dozen
new
pictures
had
been
left
unseen
in
this
rich
volume
of
the
book
of
nature
but
as
this
book
had
no
page
in
it
about
quarters
for
the
night
it
was
time
to
consider
these
homely
affairs
and
to
look
out
for
an
hotel
not
one
of
the
big
barracks
for
englishmen
spoken
of
before
but
some
quiet
place
where
one
could
stop
for
sunday
coming
suddenly
then
round
a
shady
point
behold
the
very
place
but
can
it
be
an
hotel
yes
there
is
the
name
seeburg
is
it
quiet
observe
the
shady
walks
bathing
why
there
is
a
bath
in
the
lake
at
the
end
of
the
garden
fishing
at
least
four
rods
are
stretched
over
the
reeds
by
hopeful
hands
and
with
earnest
looks
behind
watching
for
the
faintest
nibble
let
us
run
boldly
in
ten
minutes
and
the
boat
is
safely
in
a
shed
and
its
captain
well
housed
in
an
excellent
room
and
having
ordered
dinner
it
was
delicious
to
jump
into
the
lake
for
a
swim
all
hot
with
the
hot
day
work
and
to
stretch
away
out
to
the
deep
and
circle
round
and
round
in
these
limpid
waters
with
a
nice
little
to
come
back
to
and
fresh
dry
clothes
to
put
on
in
the
evening
we
had
very
pretty
english
music
a
family
party
improvised
in
an
hour
and
broken
up
for
a
moonlight
walk
while
all
this
time
one
fancied
in
the
big
hotel
of
the
town
the
guests
were
in
stiff
or
each
set
retired
to
its
and
lamenting
how
unsociable
everybody
else
had
become
i
never
was
more
comfortable
than
here
with
a
few
english
families
en
pension
luxuriating
for
the
sum
of
six
francs
per
day
and
an
old
russian
general
most
warlike
and
courteous
who
would
chat
with
you
by
the
hour
on
the
seat
under
the
shady
chestnut
and
smiled
at
the
four
persevering
fishermen
whose
bag
consisted
i
believe
of
three
bites
one
of
them
allowed
on
all
hands
to
have
been
then
on
sunday
we
went
to
lucerne
to
church
where
a
large
congregation
listened
to
a
very
good
sermon
from
the
secretary
of
the
society
for
colonial
and
continental
churches
at
least
every
traveller
if
not
every
englishman
ought
to
support
this
association
because
it
many
times
supplies
just
that
food
and
rest
which
the
soul
needs
so
much
on
a
sunday
abroad
when
the
pleasures
of
foreign
travel
are
apt
to
make
only
the
mind
and
body
constitute
the
man
i
determined
to
paddle
from
lucerne
by
the
river
reuss
which
flows
out
of
the
lake
and
through
the
town
this
river
is
one
of
four
the
rhine
rhone
reuss
and
ticino
which
all
rise
near
together
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
gothard
and
yet
while
one
flows
into
the
german
ocean
another
falls
into
the
mediterranean
both
between
them
having
first
made
nearly
the
compass
of
switzerland
the
walking
tourist
comes
often
upon
the
rapid
reuss
as
it
staggers
and
tumbles
among
the
swiss
mountains
to
me
it
had
a
special
interest
for
i
once
ascended
the
galenhorn
over
the
glaciers
it
starts
from
and
with
only
a
useless
guide
who
lost
his
head
and
then
lost
his
way
and
then
lost
his
temper
and
began
to
cry
we
groped
about
in
a
fog
until
snow
began
to
fall
and
the
snowstorm
lasted
for
six
hours
a
weary
time
spent
by
us
wandering
in
the
dark
and
without
food
at
length
we
were
discovered
by
some
people
sent
out
with
lights
to
search
for
the
benighted
the
reuss
has
many
cascades
and
torrent
gorges
as
it
runs
among
the
rough
crags
and
it
falls
nearly
feet
before
it
reaches
the
lake
of
lucerne
this
lake
itself
being
still
feet
above
the
sea
a
gradual
current
towards
the
end
of
the
lake
entices
you
under
the
bridge
where
the
river
starts
again
on
its
course
at
first
gently
enough
and
as
if
it
never
could
get
fierce
and
when
it
has
taken
you
miles
away
into
the
woods
and
can
deal
with
you
all
alone
the
map
showed
the
reuss
flowing
into
the
aar
but
i
could
learn
nothing
more
about
either
of
these
rivers
except
that
an
intelligent
man
said
the
reuss
is
a
mere
torrent
while
another
recounted
how
a
man
some
years
ago
went
on
the
aar
in
a
boat
and
was
taken
up
by
the
police
and
punished
for
thus
perilling
his
life
deducting
from
these
statements
the
usual
per
cent
for
exaggeration
everything
appeared
satisfactory
so
i
yielded
my
boat
to
the
current
and
at
parting
waved
my
yellow
paddle
to
certain
fair
friends
who
had
honoured
me
with
their
countenance
and
who
were
now
assembled
on
the
bridge
after
this
a
few
judicious
strokes
took
the
rob
roy
through
the
town
and
past
the
pleasant
environs
and
we
were
now
again
upon
running
water
the
current
after
a
quiet
beginning
soon
put
on
a
sort
of
business
air
as
if
it
did
not
mean
to
dally
and
rapidly
got
into
quick
time
threading
a
devious
course
among
the
woods
hayfields
and
vineyards
and
it
seemed
not
to
murmur
as
streams
always
do
but
to
sing
with
buoyant
exhilaration
in
the
fresh
brightness
of
the
morn
it
certainly
was
a
change
from
the
sluggish
feeling
of
dead
water
in
the
lakes
to
the
lively
tremulous
thrilling
of
a
rapid
river
like
the
reuss
which
in
many
places
is
as
wide
as
the
rhine
at
schaffhausen
it
is
a
wild
stream
too
fast
for
navigation
and
therefore
the
villages
are
not
built
on
the
banks
and
there
are
no
boats
and
the
lonely
pathless
banks
are
sometimes
bleak
enough
when
seen
from
the
water
for
some
miles
it
was
easy
travelling
the
water
being
seldom
less
than
two
feet
deep
and
with
rocks
readily
visible
by
the
eddy
bubbling
about
them
because
they
were
sharp
and
jagged
it
is
the
long
smooth
and
rock
which
is
most
treacherous
in
a
fast
river
for
the
spray
which
the
current
throws
round
such
a
rock
is
often
not
different
from
an
ordinary
wave
now
and
then
the
stream
was
so
swift
that
i
was
afraid
of
losing
my
straw
hat
simply
from
the
breeze
created
by
great
speed
for
it
was
a
day
without
wind
it
can
not
be
concealed
that
continuous
physical
enjoyment
such
as
this
tour
presented
is
a
dangerous
luxury
if
it
be
not
properly
used
when
i
thought
of
the
hospitals
of
london
of
the
herds
of
squalid
poor
in
foetid
alleys
of
the
ragged
boys
and
the
vice
sadness
pain
and
poverty
we
are
sent
to
do
battle
with
if
we
be
christian
soldiers
i
could
not
help
asking
am
i
right
in
thus
enjoying
such
comfort
such
scenery
such
health
certainly
not
right
unless
to
get
vigour
of
thought
and
hand
and
freshened
energy
of
mind
and
larger
thankfulness
and
wider
love
and
so
with
all
the
powers
recruited
to
enter
the
field
again
more
eager
and
able
to
be
useful
in
the
more
lonely
parts
of
the
reuss
the
trees
were
in
dense
thickets
to
the
water
edge
and
the
wild
ducks
fluttered
out
from
them
with
a
splash
and
some
larger
birds
like
bustards
often
hovered
over
the
canoe
i
think
among
the
flying
companions
i
noticed
also
the
bunting
or
ammer
from
which
german
word
comes
our
english
yellow
hammer
and
very
beautiful
hawks
the
herons
and
kingfishers
were
here
as
well
but
not
so
many
of
them
as
on
the
danube
nothing
particular
occurred
although
it
was
a
pleasant
morning
work
until
we
got
through
the
bridge
at
imyl
where
an
inn
was
high
up
on
the
bank
the
ostler
helped
me
to
carry
the
boat
into
the
stable
and
the
landlady
audaciously
charged
me
for
my
first
dinner
i
always
had
two
dinners
on
full
working
days
being
pretty
sure
that
she
need
not
expect
her
customer
to
stop
there
again
the
navigation
after
this
began
to
be
more
interesting
with
gravel
banks
and
big
stones
to
avoid
and
a
channel
to
be
chosen
from
among
several
and
the
wire
ropes
of
the
ferries
stretched
tightly
across
the
river
requiring
to
be
noticed
with
proper
respect
you
may
have
observed
how
difficult
it
is
sometimes
to
see
a
rope
when
it
is
stretched
and
quite
horizontal
or
at
any
rate
how
hard
it
is
to
judge
correctly
of
its
distance
from
your
eye
this
can
be
well
noticed
in
walking
by
the
seashore
among
moored
on
the
beach
when
you
will
sometimes
even
knock
your
nose
against
a
taut
hawser
before
you
are
aware
that
it
is
so
close
this
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
mind
estimates
the
distance
of
an
object
partly
by
comparing
the
two
views
of
its
surface
obtained
by
the
two
eyes
respectively
and
which
views
are
not
quite
the
same
but
differ
just
as
the
two
pictures
prepared
for
the
stereoscope
each
eye
sees
a
little
round
one
side
of
the
object
and
the
solid
look
of
the
object
and
its
distance
are
thus
before
the
mind
now
when
the
rope
is
horizontal
the
eyes
do
not
see
round
the
two
sides
in
this
manner
though
if
the
head
is
leant
sideways
it
will
be
found
that
the
illusion
referred
to
no
longer
appears
nor
is
it
out
of
place
to
inquire
thus
at
length
into
this
matter
for
i
can
assure
you
that
one
or
two
blunt
slaps
on
the
head
from
these
ropes
across
a
river
make
it
at
least
interesting
if
not
pleasant
to
examine
the
reason
why
and
now
we
have
got
the
philosophy
of
the
thing
let
us
leave
the
ropes
behind
the
actual
number
of
miles
in
a
day
work
is
much
influenced
by
the
number
of
waterfalls
or
artificial
barriers
which
are
too
dry
or
too
high
to
allow
the
canoe
to
float
over
them
illustration
shirking
a
fall
in
all
such
cases
of
course
i
had
to
get
out
and
to
drag
the
boat
round
by
the
fields
as
has
been
already
described
or
to
lower
her
carefully
among
the
rocks
as
is
shown
in
the
accompanying
sketch
which
represents
the
usual
appearance
of
this
part
of
the
proceedings
although
this
sort
of
work
was
a
change
of
posture
and
brought
into
play
new
muscular
action
yet
the
strain
sometimes
put
on
the
limbs
by
the
weight
of
the
boat
and
the
great
caution
required
where
there
was
only
slippery
footing
made
these
barriers
to
be
regarded
on
the
whole
as
bores
full
soon
however
we
were
to
forget
such
trifling
troubles
for
more
serious
work
impended
the
river
banks
suddenly
assumed
a
new
character
they
were
steep
and
high
and
their
height
increased
as
we
advanced
between
the
two
upright
walls
of
stratified
gravel
and
boulders
a
full
body
of
water
ran
here
the
current
being
of
only
ordinary
force
at
its
edges
where
it
was
interrupted
by
rocks
stones
and
shingle
and
was
thus
twisted
into
eddies
innumerable
to
avoid
these
entanglements
at
the
sides
it
seemed
best
on
the
whole
to
keep
the
boat
in
though
the
breakers
were
far
more
dangerous
there
in
the
full
force
of
the
stream
i
began
to
think
that
this
must
be
the
hard
place
coming
which
a
wise
man
farther
up
the
river
had
warned
me
was
quite
too
much
for
so
small
a
boat
unless
in
flood
times
when
fewer
rocks
would
be
in
the
way
in
reply
i
had
told
him
that
when
we
got
near
such
a
place
i
would
pull
out
my
boat
and
drag
it
along
the
bank
if
requisite
to
this
he
said
ah
but
the
banks
are
a
hundred
feet
high
so
i
had
mentally
resolved
but
entirely
forgot
to
stop
in
good
time
and
to
climb
up
the
rocks
and
investigate
matters
ahead
before
going
into
an
unknown
run
of
broken
water
such
plans
are
very
well
in
theory
but
somehow
the
approach
to
these
rapids
was
so
gradual
and
the
mind
was
so
much
occupied
in
overcoming
the
particular
difficulty
of
each
moment
that
no
opportunity
occurred
for
rest
or
reflection
the
dull
heavy
roar
round
the
corner
got
louder
as
the
rob
roy
neared
the
great
bend
for
here
the
river
makes
a
turn
round
the
whole
of
a
letter
s
in
fact
very
nearly
in
a
complete
figure
of
and
in
wheeling
thus
it
glides
over
a
sloping
ledge
of
flat
rocks
spread
obliquely
athwart
the
stream
for
a
hundred
feet
on
either
hand
and
just
a
few
inches
below
the
surface
the
canoe
was
swept
over
this
singular
place
by
the
current
its
keel
and
sides
grinding
and
bumping
on
the
stones
and
sliding
on
the
soft
moss
which
here
made
the
rock
so
slippery
and
black
the
progress
was
aided
by
sundry
pushes
and
jerks
at
proper
times
but
we
advanced
altogether
in
a
clumsy
helpless
style
until
at
length
there
came
in
sight
the
great
white
ridge
of
tossing
foam
where
the
din
was
great
and
a
sense
of
excitement
and
confusion
filled
the
mind
i
was
quite
conscious
that
the
sight
before
me
was
made
to
look
worse
because
of
the
noise
around
and
by
the
feeling
of
the
loneliness
and
powerlessness
of
a
puny
man
struggling
in
a
waste
of
breakers
where
to
strike
a
single
one
was
sure
to
upset
the
boat
from
the
nature
of
the
place
too
it
was
evident
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
save
the
canoe
by
swimming
alongside
it
when
capsized
or
foundered
and
yet
it
was
utterly
impossible
now
to
stop
right
in
front
and
in
the
middle
i
saw
the
wave
which
is
always
raised
when
a
main
stream
converges
as
it
rushes
down
a
narrow
neck
the
depression
or
trough
of
this
was
about
two
feet
below
and
the
crest
four
feet
above
the
level
so
the
height
of
the
wave
was
about
six
feet
though
rather
tall
it
was
very
thin
and
and
always
stationary
in
position
though
the
water
composing
it
was
going
at
a
tremendous
pace
after
this
wave
there
was
another
smaller
one
as
frequently
happens
it
was
not
the
of
the
wave
that
gave
any
concern
had
it
been
at
sea
the
boat
would
rise
over
any
lofty
billow
but
here
the
wave
stood
still
and
the
canoe
was
to
be
impelled
against
it
with
all
the
force
of
a
mighty
stream
and
so
it
go
through
the
body
of
water
for
it
could
not
have
time
to
rise
and
so
the
question
remained
what
is
that
wave
for
if
it
is
a
rock
then
this
is
the
last
hour
of
the
rob
xxi
xxi
i
had
not
then
acquired
the
knowledge
of
a
valuable
fact
that
a
sharp
wave
of
this
kind
has
a
rock
behind
it
a
sharp
wave
requires
free
water
at
its
rear
and
it
is
therefore
in
the
safest
part
of
the
river
so
far
as
concealed
dangers
are
concerned
this
at
least
was
the
conclusion
come
to
after
frequent
observation
afterwards
of
many
such
places
the
boat
plunged
headlong
into
the
shining
mound
of
water
as
i
clenched
my
teeth
and
clutched
my
paddle
we
saw
her
sharp
prow
deeply
buried
and
then
i
confess
my
eyes
were
shut
involuntarily
and
before
she
could
rise
the
mass
of
solid
water
struck
me
with
a
heavy
blow
full
in
the
breast
closing
round
my
neck
as
if
cold
hands
gripped
me
and
quite
taking
away
my
xxii
xxii
see
a
faithful
representation
of
this
incident
so
far
as
relates
to
the
water
in
the
frontispiece
vivid
thoughts
coursed
through
the
brain
in
this
exciting
moment
but
another
slap
from
the
lesser
wave
and
a
whirl
round
in
the
eddy
below
told
that
the
battle
was
over
soon
and
the
little
boat
slowly
rose
from
under
a
load
of
water
which
still
covered
my
arms
and
then
trembling
and
as
if
stunned
by
the
heavy
shock
she
staggered
to
the
shore
the
river
too
had
done
its
worst
and
it
seemed
now
to
draw
off
from
hindering
us
and
so
i
clung
to
a
rock
to
rest
for
some
minutes
panting
with
a
tired
thrilling
of
nervousness
and
gladness
strangely
mingled
although
the
weight
of
water
had
been
so
heavy
on
my
body
and
legs
very
little
of
it
had
got
inside
under
the
waterproof
covering
for
the
whole
affair
was
done
in
a
few
seconds
and
though
everything
in
front
was
completely
drenched
up
to
my
necktie
the
back
of
my
coat
was
scarcely
wet
most
fortunately
i
had
removed
the
flag
from
its
usual
place
about
an
hour
before
and
thus
it
was
preserved
from
being
swept
away
well
now
it
is
over
and
we
are
rested
and
begin
with
a
fresh
start
for
there
is
still
some
work
to
do
in
threading
a
way
among
the
breakers
the
main
point
however
has
been
passed
and
the
difficulties
after
it
look
small
though
at
other
times
they
might
receive
attention
here
is
our
the
old
roman
town
of
bremgarten
which
is
built
in
a
hollow
of
this
very
remarkable
serpent
bend
of
the
rapid
reuss
the
houses
are
stuck
on
the
rocks
and
abut
on
the
river
itself
and
as
the
stream
bore
me
past
these
i
clung
to
the
doorstep
of
a
washerwoman
house
and
pulled
my
boat
out
of
the
water
into
her
very
kitchen
to
the
great
amusement
and
surprise
of
the
worthy
lady
who
wondered
still
more
when
i
hauled
the
canoe
again
through
the
other
side
of
her
room
until
it
fairly
came
out
to
the
street
behind
it
must
have
astonished
the
people
to
see
a
canoe
thus
suddenly
appearing
on
their
quiet
pavement
they
soon
crowded
round
and
bore
her
to
the
hotel
which
was
a
moderately
bad
one
next
morning
the
bill
was
twelve
francs
nearly
double
its
proper
amount
and
thus
we
encountered
in
one
day
the
only
two
extortionate
innkeepers
met
with
at
xxiii
xxiii
however
i
made
the
landlord
here
take
eight
francs
as
a
compromise
this
quaint
old
place
with
high
walls
and
a
foss
and
several
antiquities
was
well
worth
the
inspection
of
my
early
morning
walk
next
day

the
wetting
and
excitement
of
yesterday
made
me
rather
stiff
in
beginning
again
and
anon
when
a
rushing
sound
was
heard
in
front
i
was
aware
of
a
new
anxiety
as
to
whether
this
might
not
mean
the
same
sort
of
rough
work
as
yesterday
over
again
whereas
hitherto
this
sound
of
breakers
to
come
had
always
promised
nothing
but
pleasure
however
things
very
soon
came
back
to
their
old
way
a
continuous
and
varied
enjoyment
from
morning
to
night
the
river
was
rapid
again
but
with
no
really
difficult
places
i
saw
one
raft
in
course
of
preparation
though
there
were
not
many
boats
for
as
the
men
there
said
how
could
we
get
boats
that
stream
the
villages
near
the
river
were
often
so
high
up
on
lofty
cliffs
or
otherwise
unsuitable
that
i
went
on
for
some
miles
trying
in
vain
to
fix
on
one
for
my
no
dinner
each
bend
of
the
winding
water
held
out
hopes
that
down
there
at
last
or
round
that
bluff
cape
at
farthest
there
must
be
a
proper
place
to
breakfast
but
when
it
was
now
long
past
the
usual
hour
and
the
shores
got
less
inhabited
and
hunger
more
imperative
we
determined
to
land
at
a
mill
which
overhung
the
stream
in
a
picturesque
spot
i
landed
unobserved
this
was
a
blunder
in
diplomacy
for
the
canoe
was
always
good
as
credentials
but
i
climbed
up
the
bank
and
through
the
garden
and
found
the
hall
door
open
so
i
walked
timidly
into
a
large
comfortable
house
leaving
my
paddle
outside
lest
it
might
be
regarded
as
a
bludgeon
i
had
come
as
a
beggar
not
a
burglar
the
chords
of
a
piano
well
struck
and
by
firm
fingers
led
me
towards
the
for
to
hear
music
is
almost
to
make
sure
of
welcome
in
a
house
and
it
was
so
now
my
bows
and
reverences
scarcely
softened
the
exceedingly
strange
appearance
i
must
have
made
as
an
intruder
clothed
in
universal
flannel
and
offering
ten
thousand
apologies
in
french
german
and
english
for
thus
dropping
down
from
the
clouds
that
is
to
say
climbing
up
from
the
water
the
young
miller
rose
from
the
piano
and
bowed
his
fair
sister
stopped
her
sweet
song
and
blushed
for
my
part
being
only
a
sort
of
casual
i
modestly
asked
for
bread
and
wine
and
got
hopelessly
involved
in
an
effort
to
explain
how
i
had
come
by
the
river
unperceived
the
excessive
courtesy
of
my
new
friends
was
embarrassing
and
was
further
complicated
by
the
arrival
of
another
young
lady
even
more
surprised
and
hospitable
quickly
the
refreshments
were
set
on
the
table
and
the
miller
sealed
the
intimacy
by
lighting
his
ample
pipe
our
conversation
was
of
the
most
lively
and
unintelligible
character
and
soon
lapsed
into
music
when
beethoven
and
goss
told
all
we
had
to
say
in
chants
and
symphonies
the
inevitable
whiled
away
a
good
hour
till
the
ladies
were
joined
by
a
third
damsel
and
the
adventures
of
ulysses
had
to
be
told
to
three
penelopes
at
once
the
miller
party
became
humorous
to
a
degree
and
they
resisted
all
my
efforts
to
get
away
even
when
the
family
dinner
was
set
on
the
board
and
the
domestic
servants
and
came
in
to
seat
themselves
at
a
lower
table
this
was
a
picture
of
rural
life
not
soon
to
be
forgotten
the
stately
grandmamma
of
the
mansion
now
advanced
prim
and
stiff
and
with
dignity
and
matronly
grace
entreated
the
stranger
to
join
their
company
the
old
oak
furniture
was
lightened
by
a
hundred
little
trifles
worked
by
the
women
or
collected
by
the
tasteful
diligence
of
their
brother
and
the
sun
shone
and
the
mill
went
round
and
the
river
rolled
by
and
all
was
kindness
because
you
are
an
englishman
the
power
of
the
is
far
better
shown
when
it
draws
forth
kindness
than
when
it
compels
fear
but
as
respects
the
formal
invitation
it
would
not
do
to
stop
and
eat
and
it
would
not
do
to
stop
and
not
eat
or
to
make
the
potatoes
get
cold
or
the
granddames
dinner
too
late
so
i
go
even
though
the
girls
had
playfully
hidden
my
luggage
to
keep
the
guest
among
them
the
whole
party
therefore
adjourned
to
the
little
nook
where
my
boat
had
been
left
concealed
and
when
they
caught
sight
of
its
tiny
form
and
its
little
fluttering
flag
the
young
ladies
screamed
with
delight
and
surprise
clapping
their
hands
and
waving
adieux
as
we
paddled
away
i
left
this
happy
pleasant
scene
with
mingled
feelings
and
tried
to
think
out
what
was
the
daily
life
in
this
sequestered
mill
and
if
my
paddling
did
for
a
time
become
a
little
sentimental
it
may
be
pardoned
by
travellers
who
have
come
among
kind
friends
where
they
expected
perhaps
a
cold
rebuff
the
romantic
effect
of
all
this
was
to
make
me
desperately
hungry
for
be
it
known
that
bread
and
wine
and
beethoven
will
not
do
to
dine
upon
if
you
are
rowing
forty
miles
in
the
sun
so
it
must
be
confessed
that
when
an
hour
afterwards
i
saw
an
auberge
by
the
water
edge
it
became
necessary
to
stifle
my
feelings
by
ordering
an
omelette
and
two
chops
the
table
was
soon
spread
under
a
shady
just
by
the
water
and
the
rob
roy
rested
gently
on
the
ripples
at
my
feet
the
pleasures
of
this
sunny
hour
of
repose
freshened
by
a
bunch
of
grapes
and
a
pear
plucked
from
above
my
head
were
just
a
little
troubled
by
a
slight
apprehension
that
some
day
the
sister
might
come
by
and
hear
how
had
been
comforted
my
lacerated
heart
again
to
boat
and
down
by
the
shady
trees
under
the
towering
rocks
over
the
nimble
rapids
and
winding
among
orchards
vineyards
and
wholesome
scented
hay
the
same
old
story
of
constant
varied
pleasure
the
hills
were
in
front
now
and
their
contour
showed
that
some
rivers
were
to
join
company
with
the
reuss
which
here
rolled
on
a
fine
broad
stream
like
the
thames
at
putney
presently
the
limmat
flowed
in
at
one
side
and
at
the
other
the
river
aar
which
last
then
gives
the
name
to
all
the
three
though
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
largest
this
is
not
the
only
aar
among
the
rivers
but
it
is
the
old
original
aar
which
swiss
travellers
regard
as
an
acquaintance
after
they
have
seen
it
dash
headlong
over
the
rocks
at
handek
it
takes
its
rise
from
two
glaciers
one
of
them
the
finster
aar
glacier
not
far
from
grimsel
and
to
me
this
gave
it
a
special
interest
for
i
had
been
hard
pushed
once
in
the
wilds
near
that
homely
hospice
it
was
on
an
afternoon
some
years
ago
when
i
came
from
the
furca
by
the
rhone
glacier
to
the
foot
of
the
valley
walking
with
two
germans
and
as
they
were
rather
muffs
and
meant
to
stop
there
i
thoughtlessly
set
off
alone
to
climb
the
rocks
and
to
get
to
the
grimsel
by
myself
this
is
easy
enough
in
daylight
but
it
was
nearly
six
when
i
started
and
late
in
september
so
after
a
short
of
mounting
the
snow
began
to
fall
and
the
darkness
was
not
made
less
by
the
white
flakes
drifting
across
it
by
some
happy
conjuncture
i
managed
to
scale
the
pathless
mountain
and
struck
on
a
little
stream
which
had
often
to
be
forded
in
the
dark
but
was
always
leading
to
the
desired
valley
at
length
the
light
of
the
hospice
shone
welcome
as
a
haven
to
steer
for
and
i
soon
joined
the
pleasant
english
guests
inside
and
bought
a
pair
of
trousers
from
the
waiter
at
for
a
change
in
the
wet
but
paddling
on
the
aar
had
no
great
danger
where
we
met
it
now
for
the
noisy
brawling
torrent
was
sobered
by
age
and
after
much
knocking
about
in
the
world
it
had
settled
into
a
steady
and
respectable
river
a
few
of
my
friends
the
snags
were
however
lodged
in
the
water
hereabouts
and
as
they
bobbed
their
heads
in
uneasy
beds
and
the
river
was
much
discoloured
it
became
worth
while
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
them
the
river
tongue
explained
already
as
consisting
of
sign
language
with
a
parallel
comment
in
loud
english
was
put
to
a
severe
test
on
a
wide
stream
like
this
consider
for
example
how
you
could
best
ask
the
following
question
speaking
by
signs
and
english
only
from
a
man
who
is
on
the
bank
over
there
a
hundred
yards
distant
is
it
better
for
me
to
go
over
to
those
rocks
and
keep
on
the
left
of
that
island
or
to
pull
my
boat
out
at
these
stumps
and
drag
her
on
land
into
this
channel
one
comfort
is
the
man
made
out
my
meaning
for
did
he
not
answer
ya
vol
he
could
not
have
done
more
had
we
both
learned
the
same
language
unless
indeed
he
had
what
i
said
mills
occurred
here
and
there
some
of
these
had
the
waterwheel
simply
built
on
the
river
others
had
it
so
arranged
as
to
allow
the
shaft
to
be
raised
or
lowered
to
suit
the
varying
height
of
water
in
floods
and
droughts
others
had
it
floating
on
barges
others
again
had
a
half
weir
built
diagonally
across
part
of
the
river
and
it
was
important
to
look
carefully
at
this
wall
so
as
to
see
on
which
side
it
ought
to
be
kept
in
selecting
the
best
course
in
a
few
cases
there
was
another
construction
two
half
weirs
converged
gradually
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
forming
a
letter
v
with
its
sharp
end
turned
the
stream
and
leaving
a
narrow
opening
there
through
which
a
torrent
flowed
with
rough
waves
dancing
merrily
in
the
pool
below
i
had
to
shoot
several
of
these
and
at
other
times
to
get
out
and
lower
the
boat
down
them
in
the
manner
explained
before
on
one
occasion
i
was
in
an
unaccountably
careless
fit
and
instead
of
first
examining
the
depth
of
the
water
on
the
edge
of
the
little
fall
i
resolved
to
go
straight
at
it
and
take
my
chance
it
must
be
stated
that
while
a
depth
of
three
inches
is
enough
for
the
canoe
to
float
in
when
all
its
length
is
in
the
water
the
same
depth
will
by
no
means
suffice
at
the
upper
edge
of
a
fall
for
when
the
boat
arrives
there
the
fore
part
say
six
or
seven
feet
of
it
projects
for
a
time
over
the
fall
and
out
of
the
water
and
is
merely
in
the
air
without
support
so
that
the
centre
of
the
keel
will
sink
at
least
six
or
seven
inches
and
if
there
be
not
more
water
than
this
the
keel
catches
the
crest
of
the
weir
and
the
boat
will
then
stop
and
perhaps
swing
round
after
which
it
must
fall
over
sideways
unless
considerable
dexterity
is
used
in
the
management
although
a
case
of
this
sort
had
occurred
to
me
before
i
got
again
into
the
same
predicament
which
was
made
far
more
puzzling
as
the
fore
end
of
the
boat
went
under
a
rock
at
the
bottom
of
the
fall
and
thus
the
canoe
hung
upon
the
edge
and
would
go
neither
one
way
nor
xxiv
it
would
also
have
been
very
difficult
to
get
out
of
the
boat
in
this
position
for
to
jump
feet
foremost
would
have
broken
the
boat
to
plunge
in
head
first
might
have
broken
my
head
on
the
rocks
below
xxiv
this
adventure
was
the
result
of
temporary
carelessness
while
that
at
the
rapids
was
the
result
of
impatience
for
the
passage
of
these
latter
could
probably
have
been
effected
without
encountering
the
central
wave
had
an
hour
or
two
been
spent
in
examining
the
place
let
not
any
tourist
then
be
deterred
from
a
paddle
on
the
reuss
which
is
a
perfectly
suitable
river
with
no
unavoidable
dangers
illustration
fixed
on
the
fall
the
canoe
was
much
wrenched
in
my
struggles
which
ended
however
by
man
and
boat
tumbling
down
sideways
and
marvellous
to
say
quite
safely
to
the
bottom
this
performance
was
not
one
to
be
proud
of
surely
it
was
like
ingratitude
to
treat
the
rob
roy
thus
exposing
it
to
needless
risk
when
it
had
carried
me
so
far
and
so
well
the
aar
soon
flows
into
the
rhine
and
here
is
our
canoe
on
old
rhenus
once
more
with
the
town
of
waldshut
end
of
the
forest
leaning
over
the
high
bank
to
welcome
us
near
there
is
a
lower
path
and
a
row
of
little
houses
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
past
which
the
rhine
courses
with
rapid
eddies
deep
and
strong
here
an
old
fisherman
soon
spied
me
and
roared
out
his
biography
at
the
top
of
his
voice
how
he
had
been
a
courier
in
lord
somebody
family
how
he
had
journeyed
seven
years
in
italy
and
could
fish
with
artificial
flies
and
was
seventy
years
old
with
various
other
reasons
why
i
should
put
my
boat
into
his
house
he
was
just
the
man
for
the
moment
but
first
those
two
uniformed
must
be
dealt
with
and
i
had
to
satisfy
their
dignity
by
paddling
up
the
strong
current
to
their
lair
for
the
fly
had
touched
the
spiders
web
and
the
spiders
were
too
grand
to
come
out
and
seize
it
good
humour
and
smiles
and
a
little
judicious
irony
as
to
the
absurd
notion
of
overhauling
a
canoe
which
could
be
carried
on
your
back
soon
made
them
release
me
if
only
to
uphold
their
own
dignity
and
i
left
the
boat
in
the
best
of
the
and
ascended
the
hill
to
the
hotel
aloft
but
the
man
came
too
and
he
had
found
time
to
prepare
an
amended
report
of
the
boat
journey
for
the
worthy
landlord
so
as
usual
there
was
soon
everything
ready
for
comfort
and
good
cheer
waldshut
is
made
up
of
one
wide
street
almost
closed
at
the
end
and
with
pretty
gardens
about
it
and
a
fine
prospect
from
its
high
position
but
an
hour
walk
appeared
to
exhaust
all
the
town
could
show
though
the
scenery
round
such
a
place
is
not
to
be
done
with
in
this
brief
manner
the
visitors
soon
came
to
hear
and
see
more
nearly
what
the
newspapers
had
told
them
of
the
canoe
one
gentleman
indeed
seemed
to
expect
me
to
unfold
the
boat
from
my
pocket
for
a
french
paper
had
spoken
about
a
man
going
over
the
country
with
a
canoe
under
his
arm
the
evening
was
enlivened
by
some
signals
burned
at
my
to
lighten
up
the
street
which
little
entertainment
was
evidently
entirely
new
to
the
waldshutians
at
least
before
we
start
homewards
on
the
rhine
with
our
faces
due
west
it
may
be
well
very
briefly
to
give
the
log
bearings
and
direction
of
the
canoe
voyage
up
to
this
point
first
by
the
thames
july
east
to
shoeburyness
thence
to
sheerness
from
that
by
rail
to
dover
and
by
steamer
to
ostend
and
rail
again
to
the
meuse
along
which
the
course
was
nearly
until
its
turn
into
holland
then
to
the
rhine
and
ascending
it
nearly
until
at
frankfort
we
go
by
rail
to
asschaffenburg
and
by
the
river
wind
back
again
to
frankfort
in
wide
curves
farther
up
the
rhine
our
course
is
due
till
from
freyburg
the
boat
is
carted
to
the
titisee
and
to
donaueschingen
and
descends
the
danube
which
there
flows
nearly
but
with
great
bends
to
and
until
we
are
at
ulm
the
rail
next
carries
us
to
the
lake
of
constance
which
is
sailed
along
in
a
course
and
through
the
zeller
see
to
schaffhausen
about
due
thence
turning
to
zurich
and
over
the
lake
and
the
neck
of
land
and
veering
to
the
by
zug
we
arrive
on
lucerne
where
the
southernmost
point
of
the
voyage
is
reached
and
then
our
prow
points
to
till
we
land
at
waldshut
this
devious
course
had
taken
the
boat
to
several
different
kingdoms
and
states
holland
belgium
france
wurtemburg
bavaria
and
the
grand
duchy
of
baden
rhenish
prussia
the
palatinate
switzerland
and
the
pretty
hollenzollern
sigmaringen
now
we
had
come
back
again
to
the
very
grand
duchy
again
a
land
where
all
travellers
must
mind
their
p
and
q
the
took
the
canoe
from
his
wife
and
put
her
on
the
rhine
and
then
he
spirited
my
start
by
recounting
the
lively
things
we
must
expect
soon
to
meet
i
must
take
care
to
keep
to
the
right
near
the
falls
of
lauffenburg
for
an
english
lord
had
been
carried
over
them
and
drowned
xxv
and
i
must
beware
of
rheinfelden
rapids
because
an
englishman
had
tried
to
descend
them
in
a
boat
with
a
fisherman
and
their
craft
was
capsized
and
the
fisherman
was
drowned
and
i
must
do
this
here
and
that
there
and
so
many
other
things
everywhere
else
that
all
the
directions
were
jumbled
up
together
but
it
seemed
to
relieve
the
man
to
tell
his
tale
and
doubtless
he
sat
down
to
his
breakfast
comfortable
in
mind
and
body
and
cut
his
meat
into
little
bits
and
then
changed
the
fork
to
the
right
hand
to
eat
them
every
one
as
they
all
do
hereabouts
with
every
appearance
of
content

this
was
lord
montague
the
last
of
his
line
and
on
the
same
day
his
family
mansion
of
cowdray
in
sussex
was
burned
to
the
ground
up
with
the
sails
for
the
east
wind
freshens
and
the
fair
wide
river
hurries
along
this
was
a
splendid
scene
to
sail
in
with
lofty
banks
of
rock
and
rich
meads
or
terraces
laden
with
grapes
after
a
good
morning
pleasure
here
the
wind
suddenly
rose
to
a
gale
and
i
took
in
my
jib
just
in
time
for
a
sort
of
minor
hurricane
came
on
raising
tall
columns
of
dust
on
the
road
alongside
blowing
off
men
hats
and
whisking
up
the
hay
and
leaves
and
branches
high
into
the
air
still
i
kept
the
set
and
with
wind
and
current
in
the
same
direction
i
scudded
faster
than
i
ever
sailed
before
in
my
life
great
exertion
was
required
to
manage
a
light
skiff
safely
with
such
a
whirlwind
above
and
a
whirlwater
below
one
nerves
were
kept
in
extreme
tension
and
it
was
a
of
pleasant
excitement
for
this
reason
it
was
that
i
did
not
for
some
time
notice
a
youth
who
had
been
running
after
the
boat
yelling
and
shrieking
and
waving
his
coat
in
the
air
we
drew
nearer
to
him
and
luffed
up
hailing
him
with
what
the
matter
and
he
could
only
pant
out

the
breeze
had
brought
me
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
falls
of
lauffenburg
the
whistle
of
the
wind
had
drowned
the
roar
of
the
water
i
crossed
to
the
right
bank
as
the
had
directed
but
the
youth
loud
cries
to
come
to
the
links
or
left
side
at
last
prevailed
and
he
was
right
in
this
the
sail
was
soon
lowered
and
the
boat
was
hauled
on
a
raft
and
then
this
fine
young
fellow
explained
that
five
minutes
more
would
have
turned
the
corner
and
drawn
me
into
the
horrid
current
sweeping
over
the
falls
while
he
set
off
in
search
of
a
cart
to
convey
the
boat
i
had
time
to
pull
her
up
the
high
bank
and
make
all
snug
for
a
drive
and
anon
he
returned
with
a
very
grotesque
carter
and
a
most
crazy
vehicle
actually
drawn
by
a
milch
cow
all
three
of
us
laughed
as
we
hoisted
the
rob
roy
on
this
cart
and
the
cow
kicked
vehemently
either
at
the
cart
or
the
boat
or
the
laughing
our
procession
soon
entered
the
little
town
but
it
was
difficult
to
be
dignified
as
the
cart
with
a
screeching
wheel
rattled
slowly
over
the
big
round
stones
of
the
street
vacant
at
midday
the
windows
were
soon
full
of
heads
and
after
one
peep
at
us
down
they
rushed
to
see
the
xxvi
a
cow
drawing
a
boat
to
the
door
of
a
great
hotel
is
certainly
a
quaint
proceeding
although
in
justice
to
the
worthy
quadruped
i
should
mention
that
she
now
behaved
in
a
proper
and
ladylike
manner

the

seems
to
resent

here
we
heard
again
of
a
certain
boat
with
five
englishmen
in
it
which
had
been
sent
out
from
london
overland
to
schaffhausen
and
then
descended
the
rhine

the
people
said
had
come
to

about
six
weeks

and
i
fully
sympathised
with
the
crew
in
their
charming
pull
especially
if
the
weather
was

as
we
had
enjoyed
that
is

the

and
at

could
not
be

we
have
come
to
the

the
exaggeration
with
which
judicious
friends
at

place
describe
the
dangers
to
be
encountered
is
so
general
in
these
latitudes
that
one
learns
to
receive
it
calmly
but
the
scene
itself
when
i
came
to
the
place
was
certainly
puzzling
and
grand
imagine
some
hundreds
of
acres
all
of
water
in
white
crested
waves
varied
only
by
black
rocks
resisting
a
struggling
torrent
and
a
loud
thundering
roar
mingled
with
a
strange
hissing
as
the
spray
from
ten
thousand
billows
is
tossed
into
the
air
and
then
you
are
alone
too
and
the
banks
are
high
and
you
have
a
precious
boat
to
guard
while
there
was
time
to
do
it
i
stood
up
in
my
boat
to
survey
but
it
was
a
mere
horizon
of
waves
and
nothing
could
be
learned
from
looking
then
i
coasted
towards
one
side
where
the
shrubs
and
trees
hanging
in
the
water
brushed
the
paddle
and
seemed
so
safe
because
they
were
on
shore
the
rapids
of
bremgarten
could
probably
be
passed
most
easily
by
keeping
to
the
edge
though
with
much
delay
and
numerous
getting
outs
but
an
attempt
now
to
go
along
the
side
in
this
way
was
soon
shown
to
be
useless
for
presently
i
came
to
a
lofty
rock
jutting
out
into
the
stream
and
the
very
loud
roar
behind
it
fortunately
attracted
so
much
attention
that
i
pulled
into
the
bank
made
the
boat
fast
and
mounted
through
the
thicket
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
i
saw
at
once
that
to
try
to
pass
by
this
rock
in
any
boat
would
be
madness
for
the
swiftest
part
of
the
current
ran
right
under
the
projecting
crag
and
then
wheeled
round
and
plunged
over
a
height
of
some
feet
into
a
pool
of
foam
broken
fragments
and
powerful
waves
next
would
it
be
just
possible
to
float
the
boat
past
the
rock
while
i
might
hold
the
painter
from
above
the
rock
on
careful
measurement
was
found
too
high
for
this
to
see
well
over
the
cliff
i
had
to
lie
down
on
my
face
and
the
pleasant
curiosity
felt
at
first
as
to
how
i
should
have
to
act
now
gradually
sickened
into
the
sad
conviction
impossible
then
was
the
time
to
turn
with
earnest
eyes
to
the
wide
expanse
of
the
river
and
see
if
haply
somewhere
at
least
even
in
the
middle
a
channel
might
be
traced
yes
there
certainly
was
a
channel
only
one
very
far
out
and
very
difficult
to
hit
upon
when
you
sit
in
a
boat
quite
near
the
level
of
the
water
but
the
attempt
must
be
made
or
stay
might
i
not
get
the
boat
carried
round
by
land
under
the
trees
far
off
were
men
who
might
be
called
to
help
labourers
quietly
working
and
never
minding
me
i
was
tempted
but
did
not
yield
for
a
philosophical
thought
had
come
upmost
that
after
all
the
boat
had
not
to
meet
wave
and
rock
now
visible
and
the
thousand
breakers
dashing
around
but
only
a
certain
few
which
would
be
on
each
side
in
my
crooked
and
untried
way
of
the
rocks
in
any
one
line
say
fifty
of
them
between
me
and
any
point
only
two
would
become
a
new
danger
in
crossing
that
line
then
again
rapids
look
worse
from
the
shore
than
they
really
are
because
you
see
all
their
difficulties
at
once
and
you
hear
the
general
din
on
the
other
hand
waves
look
much
smaller
from
the
bank
being
half
hidden
by
others
than
you
find
them
to
be
when
the
boat
is
in
the
trough
between
two
the
hidden
rocks
may
make
a
channel
which
looks
good
enough
from
the
land
to
be
quite
impracticable
when
you
attempt
it
in
the
water
lastly
the
current
is
seen
to
be
swifter
from
the
shore
where
you
can
observe
its
speed
from
a
fixed
point
than
it
seems
when
you
are
in
the
water
where
you
notice
only
its
velocity
in
relation
to
the
stream
on
each
side
which
is
itself
all
the
time
running
at
four
or
five
miles
an
hour
but
it
is
the
positive
speed
of
the
current
that
ought
really
to
be
considered
for
it
is
by
this
the
boat
will
be
urged
against
a
breaker
stationary
in
the
river
to
get
to
this
middle
channel
at
once
from
the
place
where
i
had
left
my
boat
was
not
possible
we
must
enter
it
higher
up
the
river
so
i
had
to
pull
the
canoe
up
stream
over
shallows
and
along
the
bristly
margin
wading
towing
and
struggling
for
about
half
a
mile
till
at
length
it
seemed
we
must
be
high
enough
up
stream
to
let
me
paddle
out
swiftly
across
while
the
current
would
take
the
boat
sideways
to
the
rough
water
and
now
in
a
little
quiet
bay
i
rested
half
an
hour
to
recover
strength
after
this
exertion
and
to
prepare
fully
for
a
spurt
which
might
indeed
be
delayed
in
starting
but
which
once
begun
must
be
vigorous
and
all
watchful
to
the
end
here
various
thoughts
blended
and
tumbled
about
in
the
mind
most
disorderly
to
leave
this
quiet
bank
and
willingly
rush
out
in
cold
blood
into
a
field
of
white
breakers
to
tarnish
the
fair
journey
with
a
foolhardy
prank
to
risk
the
rob
roy
where
the
touch
of
one
rock
was
utter
destruction
will
it
be
pleasant
can
it
be
wise
is
it
right
the
answer
was
to
sponge
out
every
drop
of
water
from
the
boat
to
fasten
the
luggage
inside
that
it
might
not
fall
out
in
an
upset
to
brace
the
waterproof
cover
all
tight
around
and
to
get
its
edge
in
my
teeth
ready
to
let
go
in
capsizing
and
then
to
pull
one
gentle
stroke
which
put
the
boat
nose
out
of
the
quiet
water
into
the
fast
stream
and
hurrah
we
are
off
at
a
swinging
pace
the
sun
now
shining
exactly
up
stream
was
an
exceedingly
uncomfortable
addition
to
the
difficulties
for
its
glancing
beams
confounded
all
the
horizon
in
one
general
band
of
light
so
that
rocks
waves
solid
water
and
the
most
flimsy
foam
were
all
the
same
at
a
little
distance
this
the
sole
disadvantage
of
a
cloudless
sky
was
so
much
felt
in
my
homeward
route
that
i
sometimes
prolonged
the
morning
work
by
three
or
four
hours
with
sun
behind
or
on
one
side
so
as
to
shorten
the
evening
where
it
was
dead
in
the
eye
of
the
sun
on
the
present
occasion
when
it
was
of
great
moment
to
hit
the
channel
exactly
i
could
not
see
it
at
all
even
with
my
blue
spectacles
on
they
seemed
to
be
utterly
powerless
against
such
a
fiery
blaze
and
what
was
almost
worse
my
eyes
were
thereby
so
dazzled
that
on
looking
to
nearer
objects
i
could
scarcely
see
them
either
this
unexpected
difficulty
was
so
serious
that
i
thought
for
a
moment
of
keeping
on
in
my
present
course
directed
straight
across
the
river
so
as
to
attain
the
opposite
side
and
there
to
wait
for
the
sun
to
go
down
but
it
was
already
too
late
to
adopt
this
plan
for
the
current
had
been
swiftly
bearing
me
down
stream
and
an
instant
decision
must
be
made
now
thought
i
judging
by
the
number
of
we
must
surely
be
opposite
the
channel
in
the
middle
and
now
i
must
turn
to
it
by
a
happy
hit
the
speed
and
the
direction
of
the
canoe
were
both
well
fitted
so
that
when
the
current
had
borne
us
to
the
breakers
the
bow
was
just
turned
exactly
down
stream
and
i
entered
the
channel
whistling
for
very
loneliness
like
a
boy
in
the
dark
but
it
was
soon
seen
to
be
all
right
englishman
so
in
ten
minutes
more
the
canoe
had
passed
the
rapids
and
we
floated
along
pleasantly
on
that
confused
bobbery
of
little
billows
always
found
below
broken
water
a
sort
of
mob
of
waves
which
for
a
time
seem
to
be
elbowing
and
jostling
in
all
directions
to
find
their
proper
places
i
saw
here
two
fishermen
by
one
of
the
salmon
traps
described
above
and
at
once
pulled
over
to
them
to
land
on
a
little
white
bank
of
sand
that
i
might
rest
and
bale
out
and
hear
the
news
the
men
asked
if
i
had
come
down
the
rapids
in
that
boat
yes
by
the
middle
channel
yes
they
smiled
to
each
other
and
then
both
at
once
commenced
a
most
voluble
and
address
in
the
vilest
of
patois
their
eagerness
and
energy
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
began
to
suppose
they
were
angry
but
the
upshot
of
all
this
eloquence
always
louder
when
you
are
seen
not
to
understand
one
word
of
it
was
this
there
are
other
rapids
to
come
you
will
get
there
in
half
an
hour
they
are
far
worse
than
what
you
have
passed
your
boat
be
carried
round
them
on
land
to
see
if
this
was
said
to
induce
me
to
employ
them
as
porters
i
asked
the
men
to
come
along
in
their
boat
so
as
to
be
ready
to
help
me
but
they
consulted
together
and
did
not
by
any
means
agree
in
admiring
this
proposal
then
i
asked
them
to
explain
the
best
route
through
the
next
rapids
when
they
drew
such
confused
diagrams
on
the
sand
and
gave
such
complicated
directions
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
head
or
tail
of
their
atrocious
jargon
so
i
quietly
bowed
wiped
out
the
sand
pictures
with
my
foot
and
started
again
happy
and
free
for
it
is
really
the
case
that
in
these
things
ignorance
is
bliss
the
excitement
of
finding
your
way
and
the
satisfaction
when
you
have
found
it
yourself
is
well
worth
all
the
trouble
just
so
in
mountain
travel
if
you
go
merely
to
work
the
muscles
and
to
see
the
view
it
will
do
to
be
tied
by
a
rope
to
three
guides
and
to
follow
behind
them
but
then
is
all
the
mental
exertion
and
tact
and
judgment
while
yours
is
only
the
merit
of
keeping
up
with
the
leaders
treading
in
their
steps
and
therefore
i
have
observed
that
there
is
less
of
this
particular
pleasure
of
the
discoverer
when
one
is
ascending
mont
blanc
where
by
traditional
rule
one
must
be
tied
to
the
guides
than
in
making
out
a
path
over
a
mountain
pass
undirected
though
the
heights
thus
climbed
up
are
not
so
great
when
the
boat
got
near
the
lower
rapids
i
went
ashore
and
walked
for
half
a
mile
down
the
bank
and
so
was
able
to
examine
the
bearings
well
it
appeared
practicable
to
get
along
by
the
shallower
parts
of
one
side
so
this
was
resolved
upon
as
my
course
it
is
surely
quite
fair
to
go
by
the
easiest
way
provided
there
is
no
carrying
overland
adopted
or
other
plan
for
shirking
the
water
the
method
accordingly
used
in
this
case
was
rather
a
novel
mode
of
locomotion
and
it
was
quite
successful
as
well
as
highly
amusing
in
the
wide
plain
of
breakers
here
the
central
district
seemed
radically
bad
so
we
cautiously
kept
out
of
the
main
current
and
went
where
the
stream
ran
fast
enough
nevertheless
i
sat
stridelegs
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
near
its
stern
and
was
thus
floated
down
until
the
bow
projecting
out
of
the
water
went
above
a
ridge
of
rocks
and
the
boat
grounded
thus
i
received
the
shock
against
my
legs
hanging
in
the
water
so
that
the
violence
of
its
blow
was
eased
off
from
the
boat
then
i
immediately
fixed
both
feet
on
the
rock
and
stood
up
and
the
canoe
went
free
from
between
my
knees
and
could
be
lowered
down
or
pushed
forward
until
the
water
got
deeper
and
when
it
got
too
deep
to
wade
after
her
i
pulled
the
boat
back
between
my
knees
and
sat
down
again
on
it
as
before
illustration
astride
the
stern
the
chief
difficulty
in
this
proceeding
was
to
be
equally
attentive
at
once
to
keep
hold
of
the
boat
to
guide
it
between
rocks
to
keep
hold
of
the
paddle
and
to
manage
not
to
tumble
on
loose
stones
or
to
get
into
the
water
above
the
waist
thus
by
successive
riding
and
ferrying
over
the
deep
pools
and
walking
and
wading
in
the
shallows
by
pushing
the
boat
here
and
by
being
carried
upon
it
there
the
lower
rapids
of
rheinfelden
were
most
successfully
passed
without
any
damage
it
will
be
seen
from
the
description
already
given
of
the
rapids
at
bremgarten
and
now
of
these
two
rapids
on
the
rhine
that
the
main
difficulties
are
only
for
him
who
goes
there
uninformed
and
that
these
can
be
avoided
by
examining
them
on
the
spot
at
the
cost
of
a
walk
and
a
short
delay
but
the
pleasure
is
so
much
enhanced
by
the
whole
thing
being
novel
that
unless
for
a
man
who
wishes
simply
to
it
is
better
to
seek
a
channel
for
oneself
even
if
a
much
easier
one
has
been
found
out
by
other
people
the
town
of
rheinfelden
was
now
in
view
and
i
began
to
wonder
how
the
english
boat
we
had
traced
as
far
as
lauffenburg
could
have
managed
to
descend
the
rapids
just
now
passed
but
i
learned
afterwards
that
the
had
come
there
in
a
time
of
flood
when
rocks
would
be
covered
and
probably
with
only
such
eddies
as
i
have
already
noticed
higher
up
the
river
where
it
was
deep
so
they
pulled
on
bravely
to
bâle
where
the
hotel
folks
mentioned
that
when
the
five
moist
britons
arrived
their
clothes
and
baggage
were
all
drenched
and
the
waiter
said
with
a
malicious
grin
that
thereby
his
friend
the
washerwoman
had
earned
francs
in
one
night
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
was
a
large
building
with
a
smooth
gravel
shore
in
front
to
which
i
steered
at
once
this
was
the
great
baths
of
rheinfelden
a
favourite
resort
for
crippled
invalids
the
salt
rock
in
the
earth
beneath
impregnates
the
springs
with
such
an
intensity
of
brine
that
eighty
per
cent
of
fresh
water
has
to
be
added
before
the
saline
mixture
can
be
medicinally
employed
as
a
bath
if
you
take
a
glass
of
the
water
as
it
proceeds
from
the
spring
and
put
a
little
salt
in
it
the
salt
will
not
dissolve
the
water
is
already
saturated
a
drop
of
it
put
on
your
coat
speedily
dries
up
and
leaves
a
white
stain
of
minute
crystals
in
fact
this
water
seemed
to
me
to
be
far
more
saline
than
even
the
water
of
the
dead
sea
which
is
in
all
conscience
salt
enough
as
every
one
knows
who
has
rubbed
it
on
his
face
in
that
valley
of
jericho
though
the
shore
was
pleasant
here
and
the
water
was
calm
i
found
no
one
to
welcome
me
now
and
yet
this
was
the
only
time
i
had
reason
to
expect
somebody
to
greet
the
arrival
of
the
canoe
for
in
the
morning
a
worthy
german
had
told
me
he
was
going
by
train
to
rheinfelden
and
he
would
keep
a
look
out
for
the
canoe
and
would
surely
meet
me
on
the
beach
if
i
ever
got
through
the
rapids
but
i
found
afterwards
that
he
come
there
and
with
his
friends
too
and
they
had
waited
and
waited
till
at
last
they
gave
up
the
rob
roy
as
a
missing
ship
excellent
man
he
must
have
had
some
novel
excuses
to
comfort
his
friends
with
as
they
retired
disappointed
after
waiting
in
vain
there
was
however
not
far
off
a
poor
woman
washing
clothes
by
the
river
and
thumping
and
bullying
them
with
a
wooden
bludgeon
as
if
her
sole
object
was
to
smash
up
the
bachelor
a
fine
boy
of
eight
years
old
was
with
her
a
most
intelligent
little
fellow
whose
quick
eye
at
once
caught
sight
of
the
rob
roy
as
it
dashed
round
the
point
into
the
smooth
water
of
the
bay
and
landed
me
there
a
tired
tanned
traveller
wet
and
warm
this
juvenile
helped
me
more
than
any
man
ever
did
and
with
such
alacrity
too
and
intelligence
and
good
humour
that
i
felt
grateful
to
the
boy
we
spread
out
the
sails
to
dry
and
my
socks
and
shoes
in
the
sun
and
sponged
out
the
boat
and
then
dragged
her
up
the
high
bank
here
by
good
luck
we
found
two
wheels
on
an
axle
left
alone
for
what
purpose
i
can
not
imagine
but
we
got
a
stick
and
fastened
it
to
them
as
a
pole
and
then
put
the
boat
on
this
extemporized
vehicle
and
with
the
boy
having
duly
got
permission
from
his
mamma
soon
pulled
the
canoe
to
the
gates
of
the
old
town
and
then
rattling
through
the
streets
even
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
a
bright
franc
in
the
lad
hand
made
him
start
with
amaze
but
he
instantly
rose
to
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
and
some
dozens
of
other
urchins
formed
an
attentive
audience
as
he
narrated
over
and
over
the
events
of
the
last
and
ended
always
by
showing
the
treasure
in
his
hand
and
the
herr
gave
me
this
the
krone
hotel
here
is
very
prettily
situated
it
is
a
large
house
with
balconies
overlooking
the
water
and
a
babbling
in
its
garden
which
is
close
by
the
river
the
stream
flows
fast
in
front
and
retains
evidence
of
having
passed
through
troublous
times
higher
up
therefore
it
makes
no
small
noise
as
it
rushes
under
the
arches
of
the
covered
wooden
bridge
but
though
there
are
rocks
and
a
few
eddies
the
passage
is
easy
enough
if
you
look
at
it
for
five
minutes
to
form
a
mental
chart
of
your
course
my
german
friend
having
found
out
that
the
canoe
had
arrived
after
all
his
excitement
and
pleasure
abounded
now
he
was
proved
right
now
his
promises
broken
as
it
seemed
all
day
were
all
fulfilled
he
was
a
very
short
very
fat
and
very
hilarious
personage
with
a
minute
smattering
of
english
which
he
had
to
speak
loudly
so
as
to
magnify
its
value
among
his
allemand
friends
envious
of
his
accomplishment
his
explanations
of
the
contents
of
my
were
truly
ludicrous
as
he
dilated
on
it
page
by
page
but
he
well
deserved
all
gratitude
for
ordering
my
hotel
bedroom
and
its
comforts
which
were
never
more
acceptable
than
now
after
a
hard
day
work
music
finished
the
evening
and
then
the
hum
of
the
distant
rapids
sung
me
a
lullaby
breathing
soft
slumber
next
morning
as
there
was
but
a
short
row
to
bâle
i
took
a
good
long
rest
in
bed
and
then
carried
the
canoe
half
way
across
the
bridge
where
a
picturesque
island
is
formed
into
a
terraced
garden
and
here
we
launched
the
boat
on
the
water
although
the
knocks
and
strains
of
the
last
few
days
were
very
numerous
and
many
of
them
of
portentous
force
judging
by
the
sounds
they
made
the
rob
roy
was
still
hale
and
hearty
and
the
carpenter
mate
had
no
damages
to
report
to
the
captain
it
was
not
until
harder
times
came
in
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
that
her
timbers
suffered
and
her
planks
were
tortured
by
rough
usage
a
number
of
ladies
patronized
the
start
on
this
occasion
and
as
they
waved
their
parasols
and
the
men
shouted
hoch
and
bravo
we
glided
down
stream
the
yellow
paddle
being
waved
round
my
head
in
an
original
mode
of
salute
which
i
invented
specially
for
returning
friendly
gratulations
of
this
kind
speaking
about
rheinfelden
baedeker
says
below
the
town
another
rapid
of
the
rhine
forms
a
sort
of
whirlpool
called
the
höllenhaken
a
formidable
announcement
and
a
terrible
name
but
what
is
called
here
a
whirlpool
is
not
worth
notice
the
sound
of
a
railway
train
beside
the
river
reminds
you
that
this
is
not
quite
a
strange
wild
unseen
country
reminds
you
i
say
because
really
when
you
are
in
the
river
bed
you
easily
forget
all
that
is
beyond
it
on
each
side
let
a
landscape
be
ever
so
well
known
from
the
road
it
becomes
new
again
when
you
view
it
from
the
level
of
the
water
for
before
the
scene
was
bounded
by
a
semicircle
with
the
diameter
on
the
horizon
and
the
arch
of
sky
for
its
circumference
but
when
you
are
seated
in
the
canoe
the
picture
changes
to
the
form
of
a
great
sector
with
its
point
on
the
clear
water
and
each
radius
inclining
aloft
through
rocks
trees
and
mossy
banks
on
this
side
and
on
that
and
this
holds
good
even
on
a
well
worn
river
like
the
thames
the
between
oxford
and
london
get
pretty
well
known
and
admired
by
travellers
but
the
views
will
seem
both
fresh
and
fair
if
you
row
down
the
river
through
them
nay
there
are
few
rivers
which
have
such
lovely
scenery
as
the
thames
can
show
in
its
windings
along
that
route
but
our
canoe
is
now
getting
back
to
civilization
and
away
from
that
pleasant
simplicity
where
everything
done
in
the
streets
or
the
hotel
is
strange
to
a
stranger
here
we
have
composite
candles
and
therefore
no
snuffers
here
the
waiter
insists
on
speaking
english
and
sitting
down
by
me
and
clutching
my
arm
he
confidentially
informs
me
that
there
are
no
bean
green
translating
haricots
verts
but
that
perhaps
i
might
like
a
flower
caul
so
we
assent
to
a
cauliflower
this
is
funny
enough
but
far
more
amusing
is
it
when
the
woman
waiter
of
some
inland
german
village
shouts
louder
german
to
you
because
that
she
rattles
out
at
first
is
not
understood
she
gazes
with
a
new
sensation
at
a
guest
who
actually
can
not
comprehend
her
voluble
words
and
then
guest
and
waiter
burst
into
laughter
here
too
i
saw
a
boat
towed
along
the
rhine
a
painful
evidence
of
being
near
commerce
even
though
it
was
in
a
primitive
style
not
that
there
was
any
but
men
walked
among
the
bushes
pulling
the
boat
with
a
rope
and
often
wading
to
do
so
this
sight
told
me
at
once
that
i
had
left
the
fine
free
forests
where
you
might
land
anywhere
and
it
was
sure
to
be
lonely
and
charming
after
a
few
bends
westward
we
come
in
sight
of
the
two
towers
of
bâle
but
the
setting
sun
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
see
anything
in
its
brightness
so
we
must
only
paddle
on
the
bridge
at
bâle
was
speedily
covered
by
the
idle
and
the
curious
as
the
canoe
pulled
up
at
an
hotel
a
few
yards
from
the
water
on
it
was
here
that
the
boat
had
arrived
some
weeks
ago
with
its
moist
crew
the
proprietor
of
the
house
was
therefore
much
pleased
to
see
another
english
boat
come
in
so
little
and
so
lonely
but
still
so
comfortable
and
so
dry
i
walked
about
the
town
and
entered
a
church
protestant
here
of
course
where
a
number
of
people
had
assembled
at
a
baptism
the
baby
was
fixed
on
a
sort
of
frame
so
as
to
be
easily
handed
about
from
mother
to
father
and
from
clerk
to
minister
i
hereby
protest
against
this
mechanical
arrangement
as
a
flagrant
indignity
to
the
little
darling
i
have
a
great
respect
for
babies
sometimes
a
certain
awe
the
instant
the
christening
was
done
a
happy
couple
came
forward
to
be
married
an
exceedingly
clumsy
dolt
of
a
bridegroom
and
a
fair
bride
not
very
young
that
is
to
say
about
years
old
there
were
no
bridesmaids
or
other
perplexing
appurtenances
and
after
the
simple
ceremony
the
couple
just
walked
away
amid
the
titters
of
a
numerous
crowd
of
women
the
bridegroom
did
not
seem
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
next
he
walked
before
his
wife
then
behind
her
and
then
on
one
side
but
it
did
not
somehow
feel
quite
comfortable
so
he
assumed
a
sort
of
diagonal
position
and
kept
nudging
her
on
till
they
disappeared
in
some
house
altogether
i
never
saw
a
more
unromantic
commencement
of
married
life
but
there
was
this
redeeming
point
that
they
were
not
bored
by
that
dread
infliction
a
marriage
breakfast
the
first
meeting
of
two
jealous
sets
of
new
relations
who
are
all
expected
to
be
made
friends
at
once
by
eating
when
they
are
not
hungry
and
listening
when
there
is
nothing
to
say
but
come
it
is
not
proper
for
me
to
criticise
these
mysteries
so
let
us
go
back
to
the
inn
in
the
a
frenchman
who
had
been
in
london
has
just
been
instructing
two
mexicans
who
are
going
there
as
to
hotels
and
it
is
excessively
amusing
to
hear
his
description
of
the
london
caffy
hous
and
the
hotels
in
it
is
pronounced
squar

bâle
is
in
every
sense
a
on
the
rhine
the
course
of
the
river
here
bends
abruptly
from
west
to
north
and
the
character
of
the
scenery
beside
it
alters
at
once
from
high
sloping
banks
to
a
widespread
network
of
streams
all
entangled
in
countless
islands
and
yet
ever
tending
forward
northward
seaward
through
the
great
rich
valley
of
the
rhine
with
mountain
chains
reared
on
each
side
like
two
everlasting
barriers
here
then
we
could
start
anew
almost
in
any
direction
and
i
had
not
settled
yet
what
route
to
take
whether
by
the
saone
and
doubs
to
paddle
to
the
rhone
and
so
descend
to
marseilles
and
coast
by
the
cornici
road
and
sell
the
boat
at
genoa
or
and
this
second
plan
must
be
surely
a
better
alternative
if
by
it
we
can
avoid
a
sale
of
the
rob
roy
i
could
not
part
with
her
now
so
let
us
at
once
decide
to
go
back
through
france
we
were
yet
on
the
river
slowly
paddling
when
this
decision
was
arrived
at
and
the
river
carried
me
still
for
i
determined
not
to
leave
its
pleasant
easy
current
for
a
slow
canal
until
the
last
possible
opportunity
a
diligent
study
of
new
maps
procured
at
bâle
showed
that
a
canal
ran
northward
nearly
parallel
to
the
rhine
and
approached
very
near
to
the
river
at
one
particular
spot
which
indeed
looked
hard
enough
to
find
even
on
the
map
but
was
far
more
dubious
when
we
got
into
a
maze
of
streamlets
and
little
rivers
circling
among
high
osiers
so
thick
and
close
that
even
on
shore
it
was
impossible
to
see
a
few
yards
but
the
line
of
tall
poplars
along
the
canal
was
visible
now
and
then
so
i
made
a
guesswork
turn
and
it
was
not
far
wrong
or
at
any
rate
we
got
so
near
the
canal
that
by
winding
about
for
a
little
in
a
pretty
limpid
stream
i
brought
the
rob
roy
at
last
within
carrying
distance
a
song
or
two
without
words
and
a
variation
of
the
music
by
whistling
on
the
fingers
would
be
sure
to
bring
anybody
out
of
the
osiers
who
was
within
reach
of
the
outlandish
concert
and
so
it
proved
for
a
head
soon
peered
over
a
break
in
the
dense
cover
she
wished
to
help
to
carry
the
boat
herself
but
the
skipper
gallantry
had
scruples
as
to
this
proposal
so
she
disappeared
and
soon
fetched
a
man
and
we
bore
the
canoe
with
some
trouble
through
hedges
and
bushes
and
over
dykes
and
ditches
and
at
last
through
deep
grassy
fields
till
she
was
safely
placed
on
the
canal
the
man
was
delighted
by
a
piece
he
had
been
well
paid
for
listening
to
bad
music
as
for
the
boat
she
lay
still
and
resigned
awaiting
my
next
move
and
as
for
me
i
sighed
to
give
a
last
look
backward
and
to
say
with
byron
adieu
to
thee
fair
rhine
how
long
delighted
the
stranger
fain
would
linger
on
his
way
thine
is
a
scene
alike
where
souls
united
or
lonely
contemplation
thus
might
stray
and
could
the
ceaseless
vultures
cease
to
prey
on
bosoms
it
were
here
where
nature
nor
too
sombre
nor
too
gay
wild
but
not
rude
awful
yet
not
austere
is
to
the
mellow
earth
as
autumn
to
the
year
adieu
to
thee
again
a
vain
adieu
there
can
be
no
farewell
to
scene
like
thine
the
mind
is
colour
by
thy
every
hue
and
if
reluctantly
the
eyes
resign
their
cherish
gaze
upon
thee
lovely
rhine
is
with
the
thankful
glance
of
parting
praise
more
mighty
spots
may
rise
more
glaring
shine
but
none
unite
in
one
attaching
maze
the
brilliant
fair
and
soft
the
glories
of
old
days
the
negligently
grand
the
fruitful
bloom
of
coming
ripeness
the
white
city
sheen
the
rolling
stream
the
precipice
gloom
the
forest
growth
and
gothic
walls
between
the
wild
rocks
shaped
as
they
had
turrets
been
in
mockery
of
man
art
and
these
withal
a
race
of
faces
happy
as
the
scene
whose
fertile
bounties
here
extend
to
all
still
springing
thy
banks
though
empires
near
them
fall
but
these
recede
above
me
are
the
alps
the
palaces
of
nature
whose
vast
walls
have
pinnacled
in
clouds
their
snowy
scalps
and
throned
eternity
in
icy
halls
of
cold
sublimity
where
forms
and
falls
the
avalanche
the
thunderbolt
of
snow
all
that
expands
the
spirit
yet
appals
gather
around
these
summits
as
to
show
how
earth
may
pierce
to
heaven
yet
leave
vain
man
below
harold
canto
to
my
surprise
and
satisfaction
the
canal
had
a
decided
current
in
it
and
in
the
right
direction
too
it
is
true
that
this
current
was
only
about
two
miles
an
hour
but
even
that
is
something
and
though
the
little
channel
was
hardly
twelve
feet
wide
yet
it
was
clear
and
deep
and
by
no
means
stupid
to
travel
on
after
a
few
miles
i
came
to
a
drawbridge
which
rested
within
a
foot
of
the
water
a
man
came
to
raise
the
bridge
by
machinery
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
my
way
of
passing
it
instead
that
is
to
shove
my
boat
under
it
while
i
quietly
walked
over
the
top
and
got
into
the
boat
at
the
other
side
this
was
without
doubt
the
first
boat
which
had
traversed
the
canal
without
the
bridge
being
raised
but
i
had
passed
several
very
low
bridges
on
the
danube
some
of
them
not
two
inches
above
the
surface
of
the
water
the
very
existence
of
these
proves
that
no
boats
pass
there
and
mine
only
passed
by
pulling
it
over
the
bridge
itself
it
may
be
asked
how
such
a
low
bridge
fares
in
flood
times
and
the
answer
is
that
the
water
simply
flows
all
over
it
in
some
cases
the
planks
which
form
the
roadway
are
removed
when
the
water
rises
and
then
the
wayfaring
man
who
comes
to
the
river
must
manage
in
some
other
mode
his
bridge
is
removed
at
the
very
time
when
the
high
water
makes
it
most
necessary
the
bridge
man
was
so
intelligent
in
his
remarks
that
we
determined
to
stop
there
and
breakfast
so
i
left
the
canoe
in
his
charge
and
found
my
way
to
a
little
publichouse
at
the
hamlet
of
gros
kembs
and
helped
the
wizened
old
lady
who
ruled
there
to
make
me
an
omelette
my
help
by
the
bye
consisted
in
ordering
eating
and
paying
for
the
omelette
for
the
rest
she
was
sure
to
do
well
enough
as
all
french
women
can
and
no
english
ones
the
village
gossips
soon
arrived
and
each
person
who
saw
the
boat
came
on
to
the
inn
to
see
the
foreigner
who
could
sail
in
such
a
the
courteous
and
respectful
behaviour
of
continental
people
is
so
uniform
that
the
stranger
among
them
is
bound
i
think
to
amuse
and
interest
these
folk
in
return
this
was
most
easily
done
by
showing
all
my
articles
of
luggage
xxviii
and
of
course
the
drawings
a
testament
with
gilt
leaves
was
however
the
chief
object
of
curiosity
and
all
the
of
the
party
tried
in
turn
to
read
it
xxviii
see
an
inventory
of
these
in
the
appendix
one
of
these
as
spokesman
and
with
commendable
gravity
told
me
he
had
read
in
their
district
newspaper
about
the
canoe
but
he
little
expected
to
have
the
honour
of
meeting
its
owner
fancy
the
local
organ
of
such
a
place
is
it
called
the
news
of
the
wold
or
the
gros
kembs
thunderer
well
whatever
was
the
title
of
the
gazette
it
had
an
article
about
pontius
pilate
and
my
visit
to
the
titisee
in
the
black
forest
and
this
it
was
no
doubt
which
made
these
canal
people
so
very
inquisitive
on
the
occasion
the
route
now
lay
through
the
great
forest
of
la
hardt
with
dense
thickets
on
each
side
of
the
canal
and
not
a
sound
anywhere
to
be
heard
but
the
hum
now
and
then
of
a
dragon
fly
one
or
two
woodmen
met
me
as
they
trudged
silently
home
from
work
but
there
was
a
lonely
feeling
about
the
place
without
any
of
the
romance
of
wild
country
in
the
most
brilliant
day
the
scenery
of
a
canal
has
at
best
but
scant
liveliness
the
whole
thing
is
so
prosaic
and
artificial
and
in
fact
stupid
if
one
can
ever
say
that
of
any
place
where
there
is
fresh
air
and
clear
water
and
blue
sky
and
green
trees
still
i
had
to
push
on
and
sometimes
for
a
change
to
tow
the
boat
while
i
walked
the
difference
between
a
glorious
river
encircling
you
with
lofty
rocks
and
this
canal
with
its
earthen
walls
was
something
like
that
between
walking
among
high
mountains
and
being
shut
up
by
mistake
in
no
birds
chirped
or
sung
or
even
flew
past
only
the
buzzing
of
flies
was
mingled
with
the
distant
shriek
of
a
train
on
the
railway
it
is
this
railway
which
has
killed
the
canal
for
i
saw
no
boats
moving
upon
it
the
long
continued
want
of
rain
had
also
reduced
its
powers
of
accommodation
for
traffic
and
the
traffic
is
so
little
at
the
best
that
it
would
not
pay
to
buy
water
for
the
supply
for
in
times
of
drought
canal
water
is
very
expensive
it
was
said
that
the
regent
canal
in
london
had
to
pay
for
what
they
required
last
summer
in
consequence
of
the
dryness
of
the
season
at
length
we
came
to
a
great
fork
of
the
canal
in
a
wide
basin
and
i
went
along
the
branch
to
the
town
of
mulhouse
a
place
of
great
wealth
the
largest
french
cotton
town
the
manchester
of
france
the
street
boys
here
were
very
troublesome
partly
because
they
were
intelligent
and
therefore
inquisitive
and
partly
because
manufacturing
towns
make
little
urchins
precocious
and
forward
in
their
manners
i
hired
a
truck
from
a
woman
and
hired
a
man
to
drag
it
and
so
took
the
boat
to
the
best
hotel
a
fine
large
house
where
they
at
once
recognized
the
canoe
and
seemed
to
know
all
about
it
from
report
the
hotel
porter
delayed
so
long
next
morning
to
wheel
the
boat
to
the
railway
that
when
we
took
her
into
the
luggage
office
as
usual
and
placed
the
boat
on
the
counter
with
the
trunks
and
the
officials
declined
to
put
it
in
the
train
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
been
refused
on
a
railroad
and
i
used
every
kind
of
persuasion
but
in
vain
and
this
being
the
first
application
of
the
kind
on
french
soil
we
felt
that
difficulties
were
ahead
if
this
precedent
was
to
hold
good
subsequent
experience
showed
that
the
french
railways
will
not
take
a
canoe
as
baggage
while
the
other
seven
or
eight
countries
we
had
brought
the
boat
through
were
all
amenable
to
pressure
on
this
point
we
had
desired
to
go
by
the
railway
only
a
few
miles
but
it
would
have
enabled
me
to
avoid
about
fifty
locks
on
the
canal
and
thus
have
saved
two
tedious
days
as
however
they
would
not
take
the
boat
in
a
passenger
train
we
carried
her
back
to
the
canal
and
i
determined
to
face
the
locks
boldly
and
to
regard
them
as
an
exercise
of
patience
and
of
the
flexor
muscles
as
it
happens
sometimes
one
walk
is
only
a
constitutional
the
superintendent
of
the
rhine
and
rhone
canal
was
very
civil
and
endeavoured
to
give
me
the
desirable
information
i
required
but
which
he
had
not
got
that
is
to
say
the
length
depth
and
general
character
of
the
several
rivers
we
proposed
to
navigate
in
connexion
with
streams
less
canalizé
so
i
had
to
begin
again
as
usual
without
any
knowledge
of
the
way
with
rather
an
adieu
to
mulhouse
the
rob
roy
set
off
again
on
its
voyage
the
water
assumed
quite
a
new
aspect
now
that
one
go
by
it
but
it
was
not
so
much
the
water
as
the
locks
which
were
objectionable
for
at
each
of
these
there
is
a
certain
form
of
operations
to
be
gone
through
all
very
trifling
and
without
variety
yet
requiring
to
be
carefully
performed
or
you
may
have
the
boat
injured
or
a
ducking
for
yourself
when
we
get
to
a
lock
i
have
to
draw
to
the
bank
open
my
waterproof
covering
put
my
package
and
paddle
ashore
then
step
out
and
haul
the
boat
out
of
the
water
by
this
time
two
or
three
persons
usually
congregate
i
select
the
most
likely
one
and
ask
him
to
help
in
such
a
persuasive
but
dignified
manner
that
he
feels
it
an
honour
to
carry
one
end
of
the
boat
while
i
take
the
other
and
so
we
put
her
in
again
above
the
barrier
and
if
the
man
looks
poor
i
give
him
a
few
sous
at
some
of
the
locks
they
asked
me
for
a
carte
de
permission
or
pass
for
travelling
on
their
canal
but
i
laughed
the
matter
off
and
when
they
pressed
it
with
a
mais
monsieur
i
kept
treating
the
proposal
as
a
good
joke
until
the
officials
were
fairly
baffled
and
gave
in
the
fact
is
we
had
got
into
the
canal
as
one
gets
over
the
hedge
on
to
a
public
road
and
as
i
did
not
use
any
of
the
water
in
locks
or
any
of
the
time
and
the
pass
was
a
mere
form
price
it
was
but
reasonable
to
go
unquestioned
and
besides
this
carte
could
not
be
obtained
except
at
the
beginning
having
set
off
late
we
went
on
until
about
sunset
when
the
route
suddenly
passed
into
the
river
ill
a
long
dull
stream
which
flows
through
the
vosges
into
the
rhine
this
stream
was
now
quite
stagnant
and
a
mere
collection
of
pools
covered
by
thick
scum
it
was
therefore
a
great
comfort
to
have
only
a
short
voyage
upon
it
when
the
rob
roy
again
entered
the
canal
an
acquaintance
was
formed
with
a
fine
young
lad
who
was
reading
as
he
sauntered
along
he
was
reading
of
canoe
adventures
in
america
and
so
i
got
him
to
walk
some
miles
beside
me
and
to
help
the
boat
over
some
locks
telling
him
he
could
thus
see
how
different
actual
canoeing
was
from
the
book
stories
about
it
made
up
of
romance
he
was
pining
for
some
expansion
of
his
sphere
and
specially
for
foreign
travel
and
above
all
to
see
england
we
went
to
an
where
i
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine
the
cost
of
which
was
twopence
halfpenny
after
he
left
and
as
it
was
now
dark
i
halted
put
my
boat
in
a
house
and
made
his
son
conduct
me
to
the
little
village
of
illfurth
a
most
unsophisticated
place
indeed
with
a
few
vineyards
on
a
hill
behind
it
though
the
railway
has
a
road
station
near
it
was
not
easy
to
mistake
which
was
the
best
house
here
even
in
the
dark
so
i
inquired
of
madame
at
the
white
horse
if
she
could
give
me
a
bed
not
in
a
room
for
one
alone
three
others
will
be
sleeping
in
the
same
chamber
this
she
had
answered
after
glancing
at
my
puny
package
and
dress
but
her
ideas
about
the
guest
were
enlarged
when
she
heard
of
how
he
had
come
and
so
she
managed
they
always
do
if
you
give
time
and
smiles
and
show
sketches
to
allot
me
a
nice
little
room
to
myself
with
two
beds
of
the
hugest
size
a
of
the
most
minute
dimensions
and
sheets
very
coarse
and
very
clean
another
omelette
was
consumed
while
the
customary
visitors
surrounded
the
benighted
traveller
carters
porters
all
of
them
with
courteous
manners
and
behaving
so
well
to
me
and
to
one
another
and
talking
such
good
sense
as
to
make
me
feel
how
different
from
this
is
the
noisy
taproom
of
a
roadside
english
public
presently
two
fine
fellows
of
the
gendarmerie
came
in
for
their
half
bottle
of
wine
at
one
penny
and
as
both
of
them
had
been
in
the
crimea
there
was
soon
ample
subject
for
most
interesting
conversation
this
was
conducted
in
french
but
the
people
here
usually
speak
a
patois
utterly
impossible
for
one
to
comprehend
i
found
they
were
discussing
me
under
various
conjectures
and
they
settled
at
last
that
i
must
be
rather
an
odd
fish
but
certainly
a
gentleman
and
probably
noble
they
were
most
surprised
to
hear
i
meant
to
stop
all
the
next
day
at
illfurth
simply
because
it
was
sunday
but
they
did
not
fail
to
ask
for
my
passport
which
until
this
had
been
carried
all
the
way
without
a
single
inquiry
on
the
subject
the
sudden
change
from
a
hotel
this
morning
to
the
roadside
inn
at
illfurth
was
more
entertaining
on
account
of
its
variety
than
for
its
agreeables
but
in
good
health
and
good
weather
one
can
put
up
with
anything
the
utter
silence
of
peaceful
and
cool
night
in
a
place
like
this
reigns
undisturbed
until
about
four
in
early
morn
when
the
first
sound
is
some
matutinal
cock
who
crows
first
because
he
is
proud
of
being
first
awake
after
he
has
asserted
his
priority
thus
once
or
twice
another
deeper
toned
rooster
replies
and
presently
a
dozen
cocks
are
all
in
full
song
and
in
different
keys
in
half
an
hour
you
hear
a
man
voice
next
some
feminine
voluble
remarks
then
a
latch
is
moved
and
clicks
the
dog
gives
a
morning
bark
and
a
horse
stamps
his
foot
in
the
stable
because
the
flies
have
aroused
to
breakfast
on
his
tender
skin
at
length
a
pig
grunts
his
gastric
juice
is
fairly
awake
the
day
is
begun
and
so
the
stream
of
life
thawed
from
its
sleep
flows
gently
on
again
and
at
length
the
full
tide
of
village
business
is
soon
in
agitation
with
men
faces
and
women
quite
as
full
of
import
as
if
this
french
stoke
pogis
were
the
capital
of
the
world
while
the
inmates
prepare
for
early
mass
and
my
bowl
of
coffee
is
set
before
me
there
are
four
dogs
eight
cats
and
seven
canaries
i
counted
them
all
looking
on
moving
twittering
mewing
each
evidently
sensible
that
a
being
from
some
other
land
is
present
among
them
and
as
these
little
pets
look
with
doubtful
inquiring
eyes
on
the
stranger
there
is
felt
more
strongly
by
him
too
yes
i
am
in
a
foreign
country
on
sunday
i
had
a
quiet
rest
and
walk
and
reading
and
an
englishman
who
had
come
out
for
a
day
from
mulhouse
to
fish
dined
in
the
pleasant
arbour
of
the
inn
with
his
family
one
of
his
girls
managed
to
fall
into
a
deep
pond
and
was
nearly
drowned
but
i
heard
her
cries
and
we
soon
put
her
to
rights
this
briton
spoke
with
quite
a
foreign
accent
having
been
six
years
in
france
but
his
lancashire
dialect
reappeared
in
conversation
and
he
said
he
had
just
been
reading
about
the
canoe
in
a
manchester
paper
his
children
had
gone
that
morning
to
a
before
they
came
out
by
railway
to
fish
in
the
river
here
but
i
could
not
help
contrasting
their
rude
manners
with
the
good
behaviour
of
the
little
lady
and
gentleman
children
of
my
host
one
of
these
philibert
was
very
intelligent
and
spent
an
hour
or
two
with
me
so
we
became
great
friends
he
asked
all
kinds
of
questions
about
england
and
america
far
more
than
i
was
able
to
answer
i
gave
him
a
little
book
with
a
picture
in
it
that
he
might
read
it
to
his
father
for
it
contained
the
remarkable
conversation
between
napoleon
and
his
marshal
at
helena
concerning
the
christian
religion
a
paper
well
worth
reading
whoever
spoke
the
words
this
sunday
being
an
annual
village
fête
a
band
played
and
some
very
uncouth
couples
waltzed
the
whole
day
large
flocks
of
sheep
following
their
shepherds
wandered
over
the
arid
soil
the
poor
geese
too
were
flapping
their
wings
in
vain
as
they
tried
to
swim
in
water
an
inch
deep
where
usually
there
had
been
pleasant
pools
in
the
river
i
sympathized
with
the
geese
for
i
missed
my
river
sadly
too
my
bill
here
for
the
two
nights
with
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
amounted
to
five
shillings
in
all
and
i
left
good
madame
nico
with
some
regret
starting
again
on
the
canal
which
looked
more
dully
and
dirty
than
before
after
one
or
two
locks
this
sort
of
travelling
became
so
insufferable
that
i
suddenly
determined
to
change
my
plans
entirely
for
is
not
one
free
by
the
present
route
several
days
would
be
consumed
in
going
over
the
hills
by
a
series
of
tedious
locks
besides
this
very
canal
had
been
already
traversed
by
the
boat
waterwitch
some
years
ago
a
few
moments
of
thought
and
i
got
on
the
bank
to
look
for
a
way
of
deliverance
far
off
could
be
seen
the
hills
of
the
vosges
and
i
decided
at
once
to
leave
the
canal
cross
the
country
to
those
hills
cart
the
canoe
over
the
range
and
so
reach
the
source
of
the
moselle
and
thus
begin
to
paddle
on
quite
another
set
of
rivers
we
therefore
turned
the
prow
back
went
down
the
canal
and
again
entered
the
river
ill
but
soon
found
it
was
now
too
shallow
to
float
even
my
canoe
once
more
i
retraced
my
way
ascending
the
locks
and
passing
by
illfurth
went
on
to
reach
a
village
where
a
cart
could
be
had
desperation
made
me
paddle
hard
even
in
the
fierce
sun
but
it
was
not
that
this
so
much
troubled
me
as
the
humiliation
of
thus
rowing
back
and
forward
for
miles
on
a
dirty
stagnant
canal
and
passing
by
the
same
locks
two
or
three
times
with
the
full
conviction
that
the
people
who
gazed
at
the
procedure
must
believe
me
not
only
to
be
mad
this
much
one
can
put
up
with
but
furiously
insane
and
dangerous
to
be
at
large
whether
we
confess
it
or
not
we
all
like
to
be
admired
the
right
or
wrong
of
this
depends
on
for
what
and
from
whom
we
covet
admiration
but
when
the
deed
you
attract
attention
by
is
neither
a
great
one
nor
a
deed
which
others
have
not
done
or
can
not
do
but
is
one
that
all
other
people
could
but
would
not
do
then
you
are
not
admired
as
remarkable
but
only
stared
at
as
singular
the
shade
of
a
suspicion
that
this
is
so
in
any
act
done
before
is
enough
to
make
it
hateful
nay
you
have
then
the
sufferings
of
a
martyr
without
his
cause
or
his
glory
but
i
fear
that
instead
of
getting
a
cart
for
the
canoe
i
am
getting
out
of
depth
in
metaphysics
which
means
you
know
when
ane
maun
explains
till
anither
what
he
disna
understaun
himsel
that
metapheesics
well
when
we
came
to
the
prescribed
village
named
haidwiller
we
found
they
had
plenty
of
carts
but
not
one
would
come
to
help
me
even
for
a
good
round
sum
it
was
their
first
day
with
the
grapes
and
ancient
customs
must
be
observed
so
we
went
on
still
further
to
another
village
where
they
were
letting
out
the
water
from
the
canal
to
repair
a
lock
illustration
the
rob
roy
on

here
was
a
position
of
unenviable
repose
for
the
poor
rob
roy
no
water
to
float
in
and
no
cart
to
carry
her
to
aid
deliberation
i
attacked
a
large
cake
of
hot
flour
baked
by
the
dirty
wife
and
we
stuck
plums
in
it
to
make
it
go
down
while
the
man
hied
off
to
the
fields
to
get
some
animal
that
could
drag
a
clumsy
vehicle
cart
is
too
fine
a
name
for
it
which
i
had
impressed
from
a
ploughman
near
the
man
came
back
leading
a
bullock
and
we
started
with
the
boat
now
travelling
on
wheels
but
at
a
most
dignified
xxix
xxix
the
sketch
represents
the
lady
cow
which
dragged
the
cart
at
lauffenburg
but
it
will
do
almost
equally
well
for
the
present
equipage
this
was
the
arrangement
till
we
reached
another
village
which
had
no
vineyards
and
where
therefore
we
soon
found
a
horse
instead
of
the
gruff
bullock
while
the
natives
were
lost
in
amazement
to
see
a
boat
in
a
cart
and
a
big
foreigner
gabbling
beside
it
the
sun
was
exceedingly
hot
and
the
road
dusty
but
i
felt
the
walk
would
be
a
pleasant
change
though
my
driver
kept
muttering
to
himself
about
my
preference
of
pedestrianism
to
the
fearful
jolts
of
his
cart
we
passed
thus
through
several
villages
on
a
fine
fruitful
plain
and
at
some
of
them
the
horse
had
to
bait
or
the
driver
to
lunch
or
his
employer
to
refresh
the
inner
man
in
every
case
the
population
being
favoured
with
an
account
by
the
driver
of
all
he
knew
about
the
boat
and
a
great
deal
more
at
one
of
the
inns
on
the
road
some
new
wine
was
produced
on
the
table
it
had
been
made
only
the
day
before
and
its
colour
was
exactly
like
that
of
cold
tea
with
milk
and
sugar
in
it
while
its
taste
was
very
luscious
and
sweet
this
new
wine
is
sometimes
in
request

even
in

showed
signs

revived
by
a
fresh

from

beautiful

when

gradually
brought
their

more

then
we

to

but
that
was
an
easy
matter
in

scorching
days
of

so
the
cavalcade
went
on
till
the
high
road
being
reached
we
drove
the
cart
into
the
pretty
town
of
thann
the
driver
insisted
on
going
to
hotel
but
when
there
i
saw
it
could
not
be
the
best
in
a
town
of
this
size
experience
quickens
perception
in
these
matters
and
i
simply
took
the
reins
backed
out
of
the
yard
and
drove
to
a
better
one
here
the
had
read
of
the
rob
roy
so
it
was
received
with
all
the
honours
and
the
best
of
his
good
things
was
at
my
disposal
in
the
evening
i
burned
some
signals
to
amuse
the
rustics
who
came
in
great
crowds
along
the
roads
drawing
home
their
well
loaded
with
large
vats
full
of
the
new
grapes
and
singing
hoarsely
as
they
waved
aloft
flowers
and
garlands
and
danced
around
them
the
rude
rejoicings
for
a
bounteous
vine
harvest
it
is
remarkable
how
soon
the
good
singing
of
germany
is
lost
trace
of
when
you
cross
into
france
though
the
language
of
the
peasant
here
was
german
enough
at
night
we
went
to
see
an
experiment
in
putting
out
fires
a
large
bonfire
was
lighted
in
the
and
the
inventor
of
the
new
apparatus
came
forward
carrying
on
his
back
a
vessel
full
of
water
under
the
pressure
of
six
atmospheres
of
carbonic
acid
gas
he
directed
this
on
the
fire
from
a
small
squirt
at
the
end
of
a
tube
and
it
was
certainly
most
successful
in
immediately
extinguishing
the
xxx
this
gentleman
and
other
of
the
town
then
visited
the
boat
and
the
usual
entertainment
of
the
closed
a
pleasant
day
which
had
begun
with
every
appearance
of
being
the
reverse
xxx
this
invention
has
since
been
exhibited
in
london
and
it
seems
to
be
a
valuable
one
although
this
is
a
busy
place
i
found
only
one
in
it
and
that
a
very
bad
one
a
priest
and
two
nuns
were
making
purchases
there
and
i
noticed
that
more
images
and
pictures
than
printed
books
were
kept
for
sale
next
morning
a
new
railroad
enabled
me
to
take
the
boat
a
little
further
into
the
hills
but
they
fought
hard
to
make
her
go
separate
that
is
in
a
merchandise
train
though
i
said
the
boat
was
my
wife
and
could
not
travel
alone
at
last
they
put
their
wise
heads
together
filled
up
five
separate
printed
forms
charged
double
fare
and
the
whole
thing
cost
me
just
ninepence
verily
the
french
are
still
overloaded
with
forms
and
are
still
in
the
straitwaistcoat
of
the
railway
winds
among
green
hills
while
here
and
there
a
fabrik
or
factory
nestles
in
a
valley
or
illumines
a
at
night
with
its
numerous
windows
all
lighted
up
these
are
the
chief
depôts
of
that
wonderful
industry
of
taste
which
spreads
the
shawls
and
scarfs
of
france
before
the
eyes
of
an
admiring
world
for
ladies
to
covet
and
for
their
husbands
to
buy
i
was
informed
that
the

we
managed
to
mount
the
rob
roy
on
a
spring
vehicle
and
we
set
off
gaily
up
the
winding
road
that
passes
the

of

mountains

never
had
a
more
charming
drive
for
six
hours
we
were
among
woods
vineyards
bright
rivulets
and
rich
pastures
walking
up
a
hill
we
overtook
a
carriage
and
found
one
of
the
occupants
was
an
englishman
but
he
had
resided
in
france
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
really
i
could
scarcely
understand
his
english
he
spoke
of
dis
ting
and
ve
vill
go
and
frequently
mingled
french
and
german
words
with
his
native
tongue
in
a
newspaper
article
here
we
noticed
after
the
name
matthews
the
editor
had
considerately
added
pronounced
in
english
massious
this
is
well
enough
for
a
frenchman
but
it
certainly
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
a
man
can
fail
in
pronouncing
our
th
if
he
is
a
real
live
englishman
when
he
found
out
my
name
he
grasped
my
hand
and
said
how
deeply
interested
he
had
been

the

carriage
had
been

as
an

cheap
tour
that
is
to

my
boat
and
myself
were
to
be
carried
about
miles
in
a
comfortable
vehicle
for
francs
not
very
dear
when
you
consider
that
it
saved
a
whole
day
time
to
me
and
a
whole
day
jolting
to
the
canoe
which
seemed
to
enjoy
its
soft
bed
on
the
top
of
the
cushion

to
appreciate
very
well

convenience

got
to

was

among
other
celebrated
french
stations
there
is
the
mountain
of
la
salette
near
grenoble
where
even
in
one
day
pilgrims
have
ascended
to
visit
the
spot
where
the
virgin
mary
was
said
to
have
spoken
to
some
shepherds
on
the
occasion
of
my
pilgrimage
there
i
met
some
donkeys
with
panniers
bringing
down
holy
water
in
lemonade
bottles
which
was
sold
throughout
europe
for
a
shilling
a
bottle
until
a
priest
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
started
a
private
pump
of
his
own
the
woman
who
had
been
hired
to
personate
the
holy
saint
confessed
the
deception
and
it
was
exploded
before
the
courts
of
law
in
a
report
which
i
read
on
the
spot
but
the
roman
catholic
papers
even
in
england
published
attractive
articles
to
support
this
flagrant
imposture
and
its
truth
and
goodness
were
vehemently
proclaimed
in
a
book
by
the
romish
bishop
of
birmingham
with
the
assent
of
the
pope
methinks
it
is
easier
to
march
barefoot
miles
over
sharp
stones
than
to
plod
your
honest
walk
of
life
on
common
pavement
and
with
strong
soled
boots
my
english
friend
now
got
into
my
carriage
and
we
drove
a
little
way
from
the
road
to
the
village
of
bussang
to
see
the
source
of
the
moselle
this
river
rises
under
the
ballon
a
lofty
mountain
with
a
rounded
top
and
the
stream
consists
at
first
of
four
or
five
very
tiny
trickling
rivulets
which
unite
and
come
forth
in
a
little
spring
well
about
the
size
of
a
from
which
the
water
flows
across
the
road
in
a
channel
that
you
can
bridge
with
your
fingers
but
this
bubbling
brook
had
great
interest
for
me
as
i
meant
to
follow
its
growth
until
it
would
be
strong
enough
to
bear
me
on
its
cool
clear
water
now
only
like
feathers
strewed
among
the
grass
and
singing
its
first
music
very
pretty
and
low
we
like
to
see
the
source
of
a
great
river
a
romantic
man
must
have
much
piquant
thought
at
the
sight
and
a
poetic
man
must
be
stirred
by
its
sentiment
every
great
thought
must
also
have
had
a
source
or
germ
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
and
when
some
of
the
grand
ideas
that
have
afterwards
aroused
nations
first
thrilled
in
the
brain
of
a
genius
a
warrior
a
philosopher
or
a
statesman
and
besides
having
a
source
each
stream
of
thought
has
a
current
too
with
ripples
and
deep
pools
and
scenery
as
it
were
around
some
thoughts
are
lofty
others
broad
some
are
straight
and
others
round
about
some
are
rushing
while
others
glide
peacefully
only
a
few
are
clear
and
deep
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
launch
upon
fancy
dreams
or
even
to
describe
the
real
pretty
valleys
around
us
in
the
vosges
we
go
through
these
merely
to
find
water
for
the
rob
roy
and
in
this
search
we
keep
descending
every
hour
when
the
bright
stars
came
out
they
glittered
below
thick
trees
in
pools
of
the
water
now
so
quickly
become
a
veritable
river
and
i
scanned
each
lagoon
in
the
darkness
to
know
if
still
it
was
too
small
for
the
boat
we
came
to
the
town
of
remiremont
and
to
a
bad
sort
of
inn
where
all
was
disorder
and
dirt
the
driver
sat
down
with
me
to
a
late
supper
and
behaved
with
true
french
politeness
which
always
shows
better
in
company
than
in
private
or
when
real
or
firm
friendship
is
to
be
tested
so
he
ate
of
his
five
different
courses
and
had
his
wine
fruit
and
neat
little
etceteras
and
my
bill
next
day
for
our
united
entertainment
and
lodging
was
just
this
was
an
intelligent
man
and
conversed
on
his
own
range
of
subjects
with
considerable
tact
and
when
our
conversation
was
turned
upon
the
greater
things
of
another
world
he
said
they
must
be
happy
there
for
none
of
them
have
ever
come
back
a
strange
thought
oddly
phrased
as
he
became
interested
in
the
subject
i
gave
him
a
paper
upon
it
which
he
at
once
commenced
to
read
xxxiv
xxxiv
some
days
previously
a
stranger
gave
me
a
bundle
of
papers
to
read
for
which
i
thanked
him
much
afterwards
at
leisure
i
examined
the
packet
which
consisted
of
about
thirty
large
pages
sewn
together
and
comprising
tracts
upon
politics
science
literature
and
religion
the
last
subject
was
prominent
and
was
dealt
with
in
a
style
clever
caustic
and
censorious
which
interested
me
much
these
tracts
were
printed
in
england
and
with
good
paper
and
type
they
are
a
weekly
series
distributed
everywhere
at
six
shillings
a
dozen
and
each
page
is
entitled
the
saturday
review
next
morning
the
of
september
the
rob
roy
was
brought
to
the
door
in
a
handcart
and
was
soon
attended
by
its
usual
levee
as
we
had
come
into
the
town
late
at
night
the
gazers
were
ignorant
of
any
claims
this
boat
might
have
upon
their
respect
and
some
of
them
derided
the
idea
of
its
being
able
to
float
on
the
river
here
or
at
any
rate
to
go
more
than
a
mile
or
two
but
having
previously
taken
a
long
walk
before
breakfast
to
examine
the
moselle
i
was
convinced
it
could
be
begun
even
here
and
in
this
dry
season
the
porter
was
therefore
directed
to
go
forward
and
the
boat
moved
towards
the
river
amid
plaudits
rather
ambiguous
until
a
curious
old
gentleman
with
green
spectacles
and
a
white
hat
kindly
brought
the
sceptical
mob
to
their
senses
by
telling
them
he
had
read
often
about
the
boat
and
they
must
not
make
fun
of
it
now
then
they
all
chopped
round
and
changed
their
minds
in
a
moment
the
fickle
french
and
they
helped
me
with
a
will
and
carried
the
rob
roy
about
a
mile
to
the
spot
fixed
upon
for
the
start
which
was
speedily
executed
with
a
loud
and
warm
adieu
and
bon
voyage
from
all
the
spectators
it
was
pleasant
again
to
grasp
the
paddle
and
to
find
pure
clear
water
below
which
i
had
not
seen
since
the
danube
and
to
have
a
steady
current
alongside
that
was
so
much
missed
on
the
sluggish
river
ill
and
the
basel
canal
pretty
water
flowers
quivered
in
the
ripples
round
the
mossy
stones
and
meadows
sloped
to
the
river
with
fruit
trees
heavy
laden
after
half
an
hour
of
congratulation
that
we
had
come
to
the
moselle
rather
than
the
saone
and
the
doubs
i
settled
down
to
my
day
work
with
cheerfulness
the
water
of
this
river
was
very
clear
and
cool
meandering
through
long
deep
pools
and
then
over
gurgling
shallows
and
the
fish
waterfowl
woods
and
lovely
green
fields
were
a
most
welcome
change
from
the
canal
we
had
left
the
sun
was
intensely
hot
but
the
spare
jib
as
a
shawl
on
my
shoulders
defied
its
fierce
rays
and
so
i
glided
along
in
solitary
enjoyment
the
numerous
shallows
required
much
activity
with
the
paddle
and
my
boat
got
more
bumped
and
thumped
than
in
any
other
seven
days
of
the
tour
of
course
i
had
often
to
get
out
and
to
tow
her
through
the
water
sometimes
through
the
fields
or
over
rocks
but
this
was
easily
done
with
canvas
shoes
on
and
flannel
trousers
that
are
made
for
constant
ducking
the
aspect
of
the
river
was
rather
of
a
singular
character
for
some
miles
with
low
banks
sloping
backwards
and
richly
carpeted
with
grass
so
that
the
view
on
either
side
was
ample
while
in
front
was
a
spacious
picture
of
successive
levels
seen
to
great
advantage
as
the
rob
roy
glided
smoothly
on
crystal
waters
lipped
with
green
again
the
playful
river
descends
by
sudden
leaps
and
deep
falls
chiefly
artificial
and
some
trouble
is
caused
in
getting
down
each
of
these
for
the
boat
had
to
be
lowered
by
hand
with
a
good
deal
of
gymnastic
exercise
among
the
slippery
rocks
the
mosses
and
lichens
were
studied
in
anything
but
botanical
order
at
this
period
of
the
voyage
the
paddle
felt
so
natural
in
my
hands
from
long
use
of
it
every
day
that
it
was
held
unconsciously
in
the
beginning
of
my
practice
i
had
invented
various
tethers
and
ties
to
secure
this
piece
of
furniture
from
being
lost
if
it
should
fall
overboard
and
i
had
practised
what
ought
to
be
done
if
the
paddle
should
ever
be
beaten
out
of
my
hand
by
a
wave
or
dropped
into
the
water
in
a
moment
of
carelessness
but
none
of
these
plans
were
satisfactory
in
actual
service
the
strings
got
entangled
when
i
jumped
out
suddenly
or
i
forgot
the
thing
was
tied
when
it
had
to
be
thrown
out
on
the
shore
so
it
was
better
to
have
the
paddle
perfectly
loose
and
thus
free
it
never
was
dropped
or
lost
hold
of
even
in
those
times
of
difficulty
or
confusion
which
made
twenty
things
to
be
done
and
each
to
be
done
first
when
an
upset
was
imminent
and
a
jump
out
had
to
be
managed
xxxv
xxxv
the
bamboo
mast
was
meant
originally
to
serve
also
as
a
or
hitcher
and
had
a
ferrule
and
a
fishing
gaff
neatly
fastened
on
the
end
which
fitted
also
into
the
mast
step
i
recollect
having
used
the
once
at
gravesend
but
it
was
instantly
seen
to
be
a
mistake
you
do
want
a
when
your
canoe
can
come
close
alongside
where
it
is
deep
and
will
ground
when
it
is
shallow
besides
to
use
a
you
must
drop
the
paddle
the
movement
of
the
paddle
then
got
to
be
almost
involuntary
just
as
the
legs
are
moved
in
walking
and
the
ordinary
difficulties
of
a
river
seemed
to
be
understood
by
the
mind
without
special
observation
and
to
be
dealt
with
naturally
without
hesitation
or
reasoning
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
this
faculty
increased
until
long
gazes
upwards
to
the
higher
grounds
or
to
the
clouds
were
fully
indulged
without
apparently
interrupting
the
steady
and
proper
navigation
of
the
boat
even
when
it
was
moving
with
speed
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
had
got
into
a
train
of
thought
on
this
subject
and
was
regretting
that
the
course
of
the
stream
made
me
turn
my
back
on
the
best
scenery
i
had
spun
round
two
or
three
times
to
feast
my
eyes
once
more
and
again
upon
some
glowing
peaks
lit
up
by
the
setting
sun
until
a
sort
of
fascination
seized
the
mind
and
a
quiet
lethargy
crept
over
the
system
and
moreover
a
most
illogical
persuasion
then
settled
that
the
boat
always
go
right
and
that
one
need
not
be
so
much
on
the
alert
to
steer
well
this
still
held
me
as
we
came
into
a
cluster
of
about
a
dozen
rocks
all
dotted
about
and
with
the
stream
welling
over
this
one
and
rushing
over
that
and
yet
i
was
spellbound
and
doggedly
did
nothing
to
guide
the
boat
course
but
the
water
was
avenged
on
this
foolish
defiance
of
its
power
for
in
a
moment
i
was
driven
straight
on
a
great
rock
only
two
inches
below
the
surface
and
the
boat
at
once
swung
round
broadside
on
to
the
current
and
then
slowly
but
determinedly
began
to
turn
over
as
it
canted
more
and
more
my
lax
muscles
were
rudely
aroused
to
action
for
the
plain
fact
stared
out
baldly
that
i
was
about
to
get
a
regular
ducking
and
all
from
a
stupid
lazy
fit
the
worst
of
it
was
i
was
not
sitting
erect
but
stretched
almost
at
full
length
in
the
boat
and
one
leg
was
entangled
inside
by
the
strap
of
my
bag
in
the
moments
following
that
seem
minutes
in
such
a
case
a
gush
of
thoughts
went
through
the
mind
while
the
poor
little
boat
was
still
turning
over
until
at
last
i
gave
a
spring
from
my
awkward
position
to
jump
into
the
water
the
jerk
released
the
canoe
from
the
rock
but
only
the
head
and
arms
of
its
captain
fell
into
the
river
though
in
a
most
undignified
which
was
soon
laughed
off
when
my
seat
was
recovered
with
a
wet
head
and
dripping
sleeves
however
this
little
quite
wakened
and
sobered
me
and
i
looked
in
half
shame
to
the
bank
to
see
if
any
person
had
witnessed
the
absurd
performance
and
it
was
well
to
have
done
with
sentiment
and
reveries
for
the
river
had
now
got
quite
in
earnest
about
going
along
permit
me
again
to
invite
attention
to
the
washerwomen
on
the
river
for
this
institution
which
one
does
not
find
thus
floating
on
our
streams
in
england
becomes
a
very
frequent
object
of
interest
if
you
canoe
it
on

continent
illustration
washing
barge
as
the
well
in
eastern
countries
is
the
recognised
place
for
gossiping
and
in
colder
climes
a
good
deal
of
politics
is
settled
in
the
shop
so
here
in
fluvial
districts
the
washing
barge
is
the
forum
of
feminine
eloquence
the
respectability
of
a
town
as
you
approach
it
is
shadowed
forth
by
the
size
and
ornaments
of
the
float
and
as
there
are
often
fifty
faces
seen
at
once
the
type
of
female
loveliness
may
be
studied
for
a
district
at
a
time
while
they
wash
they
talk
and
while
they
talk
they
thump
and
belabour
the
clothes
but
there
is
always
some
idle
eye
wandering
which
speedily
will
catch
sight
of
the
rob
roy
canoe
in
smaller
villages
and
where
there
is
no
barge
for
them
to
use
the
women
have
to
do
without
one
and
kneel
on
the
ground
so
that
even
in
parts
of
the
river
we
shall
find
them
there
a
flat
sounding
whack
whack
tells
me
that
round
the
corner
we
shall
come
upon
at
least
a
couple
of
washerwomen
homely
dames
with
brown
faces
and
tall
caps
who
are
wringing
slapping
and
scrubbing
the
linge
though
this
may
encourage
the
french
cotton
trade
i
rejoice
that
my
own
shirts
are
of
strong
woollen
stuff
which
defies
their
buffeting
i
always
fraternized
with
these
ladies
doffing
my
hat
and
drawing
back
my
left
foot
for
a
bow
though
the
graceful
action
is
not
observed
under
the
macintosh
other
travellers
also
may
find
there
is
something
to
be
seen
and
heard
if
they
pass
five
minutes
at
the
but
even
if
it
were
not
instructive
and
amusing
thus
to
study
character
when
a
whole
group
is
met
with
at
once
surely
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
new
sight
and
of
hearing
a
foreigner
speak
cheerful
and
kind
words
is
to
many
of
these
honest
mothers
a
bright
interlude
in
a
life
of
toil
to
give
pleasure
is
one
of
the
best
pleasures
of
a
tourist
and
it
is
in
acting
thus
too
that
the
lone
traveller
feels
no
loneliness
while
he
pleases
and
is
pleased
two
englishmen
may
travel
together
agreeably
among
foreigners
for
a
week
without
learning
so
much
of
the
life
and
mind
and
manners
of
the
people
as
would
be
learned
in
one
day
if
each
of
the
tourists
went
alone
provided
he
was
not
too
shy
or
too
proud
to
open
his
eyes
and
ears
and
mouth
among
strangers
and
had
sense
enough
to
be
an
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
englishman
is
an
island
merely
for
a
change
i
ran
the
rob
roy
into
a
long
millrace
in
search
of
breakfast
this
stream
having
secured
hold
of
the
boat
stealthily
ran
away
with
us
in
a
winding
course
among
the
hayfields
and
quite
out
of
reach
of
the
river
until
it
seemed
that
after
all
we
were
only
in
a
streamlet
for
irrigation
which
would
vanish
into
rills
an
inch
deep
in
a
water
meadow
however
i
put
a
bold
face
on
it
and
gravely
and
swiftly
sped
through
the
fields
and
bestowed
a
nod
now
and
then
on
the
rural
gazers
a
fine
boy
of
twelve
years
old
soon
trotted
alongside
and
i
asked
him
if
he
was
an
honest
lad
which
he
answered
by
a
blush
and
yes
here
is
a
franc
then
go
and
buy
me
bread
and
wine
and
meet
me
at
the
mill
a
few
of
the
hands
soon
found
out
the
canoe
moored
as
it
was
thought
in
quiet
retirement
with
its
captain
resting
under
a
tree
and
presently
a
whole
crowd
of
them
swarmed
out
and
shouted
with
delight
as
they
pressed
round
to
see
the
boy
brought
a
very
large
bottle
of
wine
and
a
loaf
big
enough
to
dine
four
men
and
i
set
to
work
with
an
oarsman
appetite
and
that
happy
which
no
multitude
of
gazers
now
could
disturb
however
one
of
the
party
invited
me
into
her
house
and
soon
set
delicate
viands
before
the
new
guest
while
the
others
filled
the
room
in
an
instant
and
were
replaced
by
sets
of
fifty
at
a
time
all
very
and
respectful
but
it
was
so
hot
and
bustling
here
that
i
resolved
to
go
away
and
have
a
more
pleasant
and
sulky
meal
by
myself
on
some
inaccessible
island
the
retreat
through
the
crowd
had
to
be
regularly
prepared
for
by
military
tactics
so
i
appointed
four
of
the
most
troublesome
boys
as
policemen
to
guard
the
boat
in
its
transit
across
the
fields
but
they
discharged
their
new
duties
with
such
vigour
that
two
little
fellows
were
soon
knocked
over
into
the
canoe
and
so
we
launched
off
while
the
manager
of
the
factory
called
in
vain
to
his
cottonspinners
who
were
all
now
in
full
cry
after
the
boat
and
were
making
holiday
without
leave

the

rapidly
enlarged
in
volume
though
one
could
easily
see
that
it
had
seldom
been
so
low
before
it
is
a
very
beautiful
river
to
row
on
especially
where
we
began
then
it
winds
to
the
west
and
north
and
again
turning
a
little
eastwards
traverses
a
lovely
country
between
treves
and
coblentz
where
it
joins
the
ancient
rhine
my
for
this
evening
was
epinal
a
town
with
little
to
interest
and
so
we
could
turn
to
books
and
pencils
until
it
was
time
for
bed
next
day
the
scenery
was
by
no
means
so
attractive
but
i
had
plenty
of
hard
work
which
was
enjoyed
very
much
my
shoes
and
socks
being
off
all
day
for
it
was
useless
to
put
them
on
when
so
many
occasions
required
me
to
jump
out
here
it
was
a
plain
country
with
a
gravel
soil
and
fast
rushings
of
current
and
then
long
pools
like
the
serpentine
and
winding
turns
leading
entirely
round
some
central
hill
which
the
river
insisted
upon
circumventing
at
noon
we
came
upon
a
large
number
of
labourers
at
work
on
a
milldam
and
as
this
sort
of
crowd
generally
betokens
something
to
eat
always
at
any
rate
some
drinkable
fluid
i
left
my
boat
boldly
in
and
knocked
at
a
cottage
when
an
old
woman
came
out
madame
i
am
hungry
and
you
are
precisely
the
lady
who
can
make
me
an
omelette
sir
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
why
said
i
look
at
these
hens
i
am
sure
they
have
laid
six
eggs
this
morning
they
seem
so
conceited
she
evidently
thought
i
was
a
tramp
demanding
alms
and
when
told
to
look
at
the
boat
which
had
come
from
england
she
said
she
was
too
old
and
too
blind
to
see
however
we
managed
to
make
an
omelette
together
and
she
stood
by
with
an
eye
perhaps
to
her
only
fork
and
chatted
pleasantly
asking
what
have
you
got
to
sell
i
told
her
i
had
come
there
only
for
pleasure
what
sort
of
pleasure
monsieur
can
you
possibly
hope
to
find
in
place
but
i
was
far
too
gallant
to
say
bluntly
that
her
particular
mansion
was
not
the
ultimate
object
of
the
tour
after
receiving
a
franc
for
the
rough
breakfast
she
kept
up
a
battery
of
blessings
till
the
rob
roy
started
and
she
ended
by
shrieking
out
to
a
navvy
looking
on
i
tell
you
every
englishman
is
rich
next
day
was
bright
and
as
before
and
an
early
start
got
the
fine
fresh
morning
air
on
the
water
the
name
of
this
river
is
sometimes
pronounced
moselle
and
at
other
times
mosel
what
we
should
call
mozle
when
a
frenchman
speaks
of
la
moselle
he
puts
an
equal
emphasis
on
each
of
the
three
syllables
he
is
pronouncing
whereas
generally
we
englishmen
call
this
river
mosélle
the
name
of
a
long
river
often
indeed
goes
through
changes
as
it
traverses
various
districts
and
dialects
for
instance
the
missouri
which
you
hear
the
travellers
in
kansas
call
mzoory
while
they
wend
along
the
californian
road
when
the
scenery
is
tame
to
the
canoist
and
the
channel
of
the
river
is
not
made
interesting
by
dangers
to
be
avoided
then
one
can
always
turn
again
to
the
animals
and
birds
and
five
minutes
of
watching
will
be
sure
to
see
much
that
is
curious
here
for
instance
we
have
the
little
kingfisher
again
who
had
met
us
on
the
danube
and
the
reuss
and
whom
we
knew
well
in
england
before
but
now
we
are
on
a
visit
to
domain
and
we
see
him
in
his
private
character
alone
there
are
several
varieties
of
this
bird
and
they
differ
in
form
and
colour
of
plumage
this
royal
bird
the
of
antiquity
the
in
classic
tongue
is
called
in
german
eis
fogl
or
ice
bird
perhaps
because
he
fishes
even
in
winter
frost
or
because
his
nest
is
like
a
bundle
of
icicles
being
made
of
bones
most
curiously
wrought
together
but
now
it
is
on
a
summer
day
and
he
is
perched
on
a
twig
within
two
inches
of
the
water
and
under
the
shade
of
a
briar
leaf
his
little
parasol
he
is
looking
for
fish
and
is
so
steady
that
you
may
easily
pass
him
without
observing
that
brilliant
back
of
azure
or
the
breast
of
blushing
red
when
i
desired
to
see
these
birds
i
quietly
moved
my
boat
till
it
grounded
on
a
bank
and
after
it
was
stationary
thus
for
a
few
minutes
the
halcyon
fisher
got
quite
unconcerned
and
plied
his
task
as
if
unseen
he
peers
with
knowing
eye
into
the
shallow
below
him
and
now
and
then
he
dips
his
head
a
bit
to
make
quite
sure
he
has
marked
a
fish
worth
seizing
then
suddenly
he
darts
down
with
a
spluttering
splash
and
flies
off
with
a
little
white
minnow
or
a
struggling
sticklebat
nipped
in
his
beak
if
it
is
caught
thus
crosswise
the
winged
fisherman
tosses
his
prey
into
the
air
and
nimbly
catches
it
in
his
mouth
so
that
it
may
be
gulped
down
properly
then
he
quivers
and
shakes
with
satisfaction
and
quickly
speeds
to
another
perch
flitting
by
you
with
wonderful
swiftness
as
if
a
sapphire
had
been
flung
athwart
the
sunbeam
flashing
beauteous
colours
in
its
flight
or
if
has
come
or
he
is
fetching
home
the
family
dinner
he
flutters
on
and
on
and
then
with
a
little
sharp
note
of
pops
into
a
hole
the
dark
staircase
to
his
tiny
nest
and
there
he
finds
mrs
halcyon
sitting
in
state
and
thirteen
baby
kingfishers
gaping
for
the
dainty
fish
this
pretty
bird
has
an
air
of
quiet
mystery
beauty
and
vivid
motion
all
combined
which
has
made
him
a
favourite
with
the
rob
roy
strangely
enough
the
river
in
this
part
of
its
course
actually
gets
less
and
less
as
you
descend
it
every
few
miles
some
of
the
water
is
drawn
off
by
a
small
canal
to
irrigate
the
neighbouring
land
and
in
a
season
of
drought
like
this
very
little
of
the
abstracted
part
returns
they
told
me
that
the
moselle
river
never
has
been
so
basse
for
years
and
i
was
therefore
an
unlucky
in
having
to
do
for
the
first
time
what
could
have
been
done
more
easily
in
any
other
season
as
evening
fell
we
reached
the
town
of
chatel
and
the
rob
roy
was
sent
to
bed
in
the
washhouse
of
the
hotel
but
five
minutes
had
not
elapsed
before
a
string
of
visitors
came
for
the
daily
inspection
of
the
boat
as
i
sauntered
along
the
bridge
a
sprightly
youth
came
up
who
had
not
seen
the
canoe
but
who
knew
i
was
one
of
her
crew
he
was
most
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
and
took
me
to
see
boat
a
open
cot
painted
all
manner
of
patterns
and
as
he
was
extremely
proud
of
her
i
did
not
tell
him
that
a
boat
is
like
a
woman
too
good
to
paint
a
pretty
one
is
spoiled
by
paint
and
a
plain
one
is
made
hideous
then
he
came
for
a
look
at
the
rob
roy
and
poor
fellow
it
was
amusing
to
observe
how
instantly
his
countenance
fell
from
pride
to
intense
envy
he
had
a
boating
mind
but
had
never
seen
a
really
pretty
boat
till
now
however
to
console
himself
he
invited
me
to
another
hotel
to
drink
success
to
the
canoe
in
bavarian
beer
and
to
see
my
drawings
and
then
i
found
that
my
intelligent
eager
and
we
may
add
gentlemanly
friend
was
the
waiter
there
a
melancholy
sensation
pervaded
the
rob
roy
in
consequence
of
a
sad
event
the
loss
of
the
captain
knife
we
had
three
knives
on
board
in
starting
from
england
one
had
been
given
away
in
reward
for
some
signal
service
and
this
which
was
now
lost
was
one
with
a
metal
haft
and
a
curious
hook
at
the
end
a
special
description
made
in
berlin
and
very
useful
to
the
tourist
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
in
so
many
leaps
and
somersaults
and
with
such
constant
requirements
for
the
knife
to
mend
pencils
the
trusty
blade
should
at
last
have
disappeared
but
the
event
suggests
to
the
next
canoeman
that
his
should
be
secured
to
a
lanyard
one
singular
conformation
of
the
occurred
in
my
short
tour
upon
this
part
of
the
moselle
without
much
warning
the
banks
of
rock
became
quite
vertical
and
narrowed
close
together
they
reminded
me
of
the
near
liverpool
on
the
old
railway
to
manchester
the
stream
was
very
deep
here
but
its
bed
was
full
of
enormous
stones
and
crags
very
sharp
and
jagged
which
however
could
be
easily
avoided
because
the
current
was
gentle
a
man
i
found
fishing
told
me
that
a
little
further
on
there
was
an
impossible
place
so
when
after
half
a
mile
the
sound
of
rushing
waters
came
the
ear
got
marvellous
quick
for
this
we
beat
to
quarters
and
prepared
for
action
the
ribbon
to
keep
my
hat
was
tied
down
sleeves
and
trousers
were
tucked
up
the
covering
was
braced
tight
and
the
baggage
secured
below
and
then
came
the
eager
pleasures
of
anticipating
wishing
hoping
fearing
that
are
mixed
up
in
the
word
excitement
the
sound
was
quite
near
now
but
the
river
took
the
strangest
of
all
the
forms
i
had
yet
seen
if
you
suppose
a
trench
cut
along
to
get
at
the
and
if
all
the
water
of
a
river
which
had
filled
the
street
before
suddenly
disappeared
in
the
trench
that
would
be
exactly
what
the
moselle
had
now
become
the
plateau
of
rock
on
each
side
was
perfectly
dry
though
in
flood
times
no
doubt
the
river
covers
that
too
the
water
boiled
and
foamed
through
this
channel
from
to
feet
deep
but
only
in
the
trench
which
was
not
five
feet
wide
an
intelligent
man
came
near
to
see
me
enter
this
curious
passage
but
when
we
had
got
a
little
way
in
i
had
to
stop
the
boat
and
this
too
by
putting
my
hands
on
both
sides
of
the
river
then
i
got
out
and
carefully
let
the
boat
drive
along
the
current
but
still
held
by
the
painter
soon
it
got
too
narrow
and
fast
even
for
this
process
so
i
pulled
the
canoe
upon
the
dry
rock
and
sat
down
to
breathe
and
to
cool
my
panting
frame
two
other
gentlemen
had
come
near
me
by
this
time
and
on
a
bridge
above
were
several
more
with
two
ladies
i
had
to
drag
the
boat
some
hundred
yards
over
most
awkward
rocks
and
these
men
hovered
round
and
admired
and
even
talked
to
me
and
actually
praised
my
perseverance
yet
not
one
offer
of
any
help
did
any
one
of
them
give
in
deep
water
again
and
now
exactly
under
the
bridge
i
looked
up
and
found
the
whole
party
regarding
the
rob
roy
with
curiosity
and
smiles
within
a
few
yards
was
a
large
house
these
people
had
come
from
and
i
thought
their
smiles
were
surely
to
preface
would
you
not
like
a
glass
of
wine
sir
after
your
hour
of
hard
work
but
as
it
meant
nothing
of
the
sort
i
could
not
help
answering
their
united
adieux
by
these
words
adieu
ladies
and
gentlemen
many
to
look
but
none
to
help
the
exhibition
is
gratuitous
was
it
wrong
to
say
this
it
was
utterly
impossible
not
to
think
as
much
one
or
two
other
places
gave
trouble
without
interest
such
as
when
i
had
to
push
the
boat
into
a
hedge
point
foremost
and
to
pull
it
through
by
main
force
from
the
other
side
and
then
found
after
all
it
was
pushed
into
the
wrong
field
so
the
operation
had
to
be
done
over
again
in
a
reverse
direction
but
never
mind
all
this
counted
in
the
day
work
and
all
the
trouble
of
it
was
forgotten
after
a
good
night
sleep
or
was
entirely
recompensed
by
some
interesting
adventure
the
water
of
the
moselle
is
so
clear
that
the
scenery
under
the
surface
continually
occupied
my
attention
in
one
long
reach
unusually
deep
and
quiet
i
happened
to
be
gazing
down
at
some
huge
trout
and
accidentally
observed
a
large
stone
the
upper
part
of
a
fine
column
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
water
at
least
ten
feet
below
me
the
capital
showed
it
to
be
ionic
and
near
it
was
another
a
broken
pediment
of
large
dimensions
and
a
little
further
on
a
pedestal
of
white
marble
i
carefully
examined
both
banks
to
see
if
a
roman
villa
or
bridge
or
other
ruin
indicated
how
these
subaqueous
reliques
had
come
into
this
strange
position
and
i
inquired
diligently
at
charmes
the
next
town
but
although
much
curiosity
was
shown
on
the
subject
no
information
was
obtained
except
that
the
romans
had
built
a
fort
somewhere
on
the
river
but
plainly
not
at
that
spot
so
we
may
consider
that
the
casual
glance
at
the
fish
revealed
a
curious
fragment
of
the
past
hitherto
probably
unnoticed
after
pulling
along
the
moselle
from
as
near
to
its
source
as
my
canoe
could
find
water
until
the
scenery
became
dull
at
charmes
we
went
by
railway
from
thence
to
blainville
on
the
river
meurthe
which
is
a
tributary
of
the
moselle
for
i
thought
some
new
scenery
might
be
found
in
this
direction
the
rob
roy
was
therefore
sent
by
itself
in
a
the
very
first
separation
between
us
for
three
months
it
seemed
as
if
the
little
boat
leaning
on
its
side
in
the
truck
turned
from
me
reproachfully
and
we
foreboded
all
sorts
of
accidents
to
its
delicate
frame
but
the
only
thing
lost
was
a
sponge
a
necessary
appendage
to
a
boat
outfit
when
you
desire
to
keep
it
perfectly
dry
and
clean
two
railway
porters
with
much
laughing
carried
the
rob
roy
from
the
station
to
the
river
edge
and
again
we
paddled
cheerily
along
and
on
a
new
river
too
with
scenery
and
character
quite
different
from
that
of
the
moselle
the
meurthe
winds
through
rich
plains
of
soft
earth
with
few
rocks
and
little
gravel
but
then
in
its
shallows
it
has
long
thick
mossy
weeds
all
under
the
surface
these
were
found
to
be
rather
troublesome
because
they
got
entangled
with
my
paddle
and
since
they
could
not
be
seen
beforehand
the
best
channel
was
not
discernible
as
where
rocks
or
gravel
give
those
various
forms
of
ripples
which
the
captain
of
a
canoe
soon
gets
to
know
as
if
they
were
a
chart
telling
the
number
of
inches
of
depth
moreover
when
you
get
grounded
among
these
long
weeds
all
pointed
down
stream
it
is
very
difficult
to
back
out
for
it
is
like
combing
hair
against
the
grain
the
larger
rivers
in
france
are
all
thoroughly
fished
in
every
nook
you
find
a
fisherman
they
are
just
as
numerous
here
as
in
germany
they
are
rare
and
yet
one
would
think
that
fishing
is
surely
more
adapted
to
the
contemplative
german
than
to
the
vivacious
french
yet
here
they
are
by
hundreds
both
men
and
women
and
every
day
each
staring
intently
on
a
tiny
float
or
at
the
grasshopper
bait
and
quite
satisfied
if
now
and
then
he
can
pull
up
a
gudgeon
the
size
of
your
thumb
illustration
french
fishers
generally
these
people
are
alone
and
when
they
asked
me
at
hotels
if
i
did
not
feel
lonely
in
the
canoe
the
answer
was
look
at
your
fishermen
for
hours
by
choice
alone
they
have
something
to
occupy
attention
every
moment
and
so
have
i
sometimes
however
there
is
a
whole
party
in
one
clumsy
boat
the
sits
content
and
recks
not
if
all
his
time
is
spent
in
baiting
his
line
and
lighting
his
pipe
the
lazy
hopeful
lies
at
full
length
on
the
grass
while
a
younger
brother
strains
every
nerve
to
hook
a
knowing
fish
that
is
laughing
at
him
under
water
and
winking
its
pale
eye
to
see
the
fisher
just
toppling
over
mademoiselle
chatters
whether
there
are
bites
or
not
and
another
the
fair
cousin
has
got
on
shore
where
she
can
bait
her
hook
and
set
her
cap
and
simper
to
the
bold
admirer
by
her
side
not
one
of
these
that
i
have
spoken
to
had
ever
seen
an
artificial
fly
then
besides
we
have
the
fishers
with
nets
these
are
generally
three
men
in
a
boat
with
its
stem
and
its
stern
both
cocked
up
and
the
whole
affair
looking
as
if
it
must
upset
or
sink
such
boats
were
painted
by
raphael
in
the
great
cartoons
where
all
of
us
must
have
observed
how
small
the
boat
is
compared
with
the
men
it
carries
again
there
are
some
young
lads
searching
under
the
stones
for
the
freshwater
prawns
much
in
request
but
giving
very
little
food
for
a
great
deal
of
trouble
near
these
fishers
the
pike
plies
his
busy
sportsman
life
below
the
surface
and
i
have
sometimes
seen
a
poor
little
trout
leap
high
into
the
air
to
escape
from
the
pursuer
who
followed
him
even
out
of
the
water
and
snapped
his
jaws
on
the
sweet
morsel
impudently
this
sound
added
to
the
very
suspicious
appearance
of
the
rob
roy
gliding
among
the
islands
decides
the
doubtful
point
with
a
duck
the
leader
of
a
flock
of
wild
ducks
that
have
been
swimming
down
stream
in
front
of
me
with
a
quick
glance
on
each
side
every
one
of
them
seemingly
indignant
at
this
intrusion
on
their
haunts
at
last
they
find
it
really
will
not
do
so
with
a
scream
and
a
spring
they
flap
the
water
and
rise
in
a
body
to
seek
if
there
be
not
elsewhere
at
least
some
one
nook
to
nestle
in
where
john
bull
does
not
come
that
bell
you
hear
tinkling
is
at
the
ferry
to
call
the
ferryman
who
lives
at
the
other
side
and
he
will
jump
into
his
clumsy
boat
which
is
tied
to
a
pulley
running
on
a
rope
stretched
tight
across
the
river
he
has
only
to
put
his
oar
obliquely
on
the
gunwale
and
the
transverse
pressure
of
the
current
brings
the
boat
rapidly
to
the
other
bank
paddling
on
after
a
chat
with
the
ferryman
and
he
is
sure
to
be
ready
for
that
a
wonderful
phenomenon
appears
we
see
a
house
large
new
and
of
two
stories
high
it
has
actually
moved
we
noticed
it
a
few
minutes
ago
and
now
it
has
changed
its
position
i
gaze
in
astonishment
and
while
we
ponder
lo
the
whole
house
entirely
disappears
now
the
true
explanation
of
this
is
soon
found
when
we
get
round
the
next
corner
of
the
reach
the
house
is
a
great
wooden
bathing
etablissement
built
on
a
barge
and
it
is
being
slowly
dragged
up
the
stream
after
wonder
comes
sentiment
three
women
are
seen
on
the
evidently
in
great
alarm
a
mother
a
daughter
and
a
servant
maid
who
searched
in
vain
for
two
boys
supposed
to
have
gone
away
to
fish
but
now
missing
for
many
hours
they
eagerly
inquired
if
i
had
seen
the
lads
and
implored
me
with
tears
to
give
them
advice
i
tried
all
i
could
to
recollect
but
no
i
had
not
seen
the
boys
and
so
the
women
went
away
distracted
and
left
me
sorrowful
who
would
not
be
so
at
a
woman
tears
a
mother
too
but
suddenly
when
toiling
in
the
middle
of
a
very
difficult
piece
of
lowering
the
boat
i
remembered
having
seen
those
boys
so
i
ran
over
the
fields
after
the
anxious
mamma
and
soon
assured
her
the
children
had
been
safe
an
hour
ago
and
their
faithful
servant
with
them
but
that
had
become
the
fisherman
and
they
like
boys
had
got
tired
of
the
rod
and
were
playing
with
a
goat
when
the
poor
mother
heard
we
had
seen
the
little
fellows
and
they
were
safe
her
tears
of
joy
were
quite
affecting
and
they
vividly
recalled
one
schoolboy
days
when
the
thoughtless
playtime
of
childhood
so
often
entails
anxiety
on
a
loving
mother
heart
such
then
are
the
river
sights
and
river
wonders
ever
new
though
trifling
perhaps
when
told
but
far
more
lively
and
entertaining
than
the
common
incidents
of
a
dusty
road
or
a
whirring
shrieking
train
with
a
few
wadings
and
bumpings
and
one
or
two
vannes
or
weirs
we
slipped
along
pleasantly
until
evening
came
still
it
was
only
a
slow
stream
and
the
towers
of
nicholas
long
visible
on
the
horizon
seemed
ever
to
move
from
side
to
side
without
being
any
nearer
so
much
does
this
river
wind
in
its
course
i
paddled
at
my
best
pace
but
the
evening
rapidly
grew
darker
until
we
overtook
two
french
youths
in
a
boat
the
first
occasion
on
which
we
had
noticed
frenchmen
rowing
for
exercise
they
could
not
keep
up
with
the
canoe
so
we
had
to
leave
them
ingloriously
aground
on
a
bank
and
yet
too
lazy
to
get
out
and
help
their
boat
over
the
difficulty
soon
after
i
came
to
a
great
weir
about
fifteen
feet
in
height
the
deepest
we
had
yet
encountered
and
half
a
sigh
was
heaved
when
it
was
evident
that
there
was
no
escape
from
all
the
bother
of
getting
out
and
gymnasticizing
here
after
a
long
day
work
it
was
a
matter
of
some
time
and
trouble
to
get
the
boat
over
this
weir
in
the
dark
but
what
was
far
worse
immediately
followed
as
i
found
myself
in
a
maze
of
shallows
without
light
to
see
how
to
get
through
them
whenever
we
stopped
too
for
rest
there
was
only
darkness
silence
and
no
motion
not
even
the
excitement
of
a
current
to
arouse
finally
i
had
to
wade
and
haul
the
boat
along
and
jump
in
and
ferry
myself
over
the
pools
for
nearly
half
a
mile
until
at
length
the
man
of
our
starboard
watch
shouted
a
bridge
and
a
house
on
the
lee
bow
and
a
joyous
cheer
burst
forth
from
the
crew
all
this
which
may
be
told
in
a
few
sentences
took
a
full
hour
of
very
tiresome
work
though
as
there
was
no
current
there
was
no
danger
and
it
was
merely
tedious
wet
unlighted
and
uncomfortable
nevertheless
i
sang
and
whistled
all
the
time
when
the
bridge
was
arrived
at
i
was
sure
it
must
be
a
town
and
then
there
happened
a
scene
almost
an
exact
counterpart
of
that
which
took
place
at
gegglingen
on
the
danube
i
pulled
up
my
boat
on
the
dark
shore
and
all
dripping
wet
i
mounted
to
the
house
above
and
speedily
aroused
the
inmates
a
window
opened
and
a
worthy
couple
appeared
in
their
holding
a
candle
to
examine
the
intruder
the
tableau
was
most
comical
the
man
asked
is
it
a
farce
he
could
scarcely
expect
a
traveller
from
england
to
arrive
there
at
such
an
hour
but
he
soon
helped
me
to
carry
the
boat
to
a
little
restaurant
where
a
dozen
men
were
drinking
who
rushed
out
with
lamps
to
look
at
the
boat
but
entirely
omitted
to
help
the
forlorn
captain
nor
was
there
any
room
in
this
restaurant
so
we
had
to
carry
the
boat
through
the
dark
streets
to
another
house
where
another
lot
of
topers
received
me
in
like
style
we
put
the
rob
roy
into
a
garden
here
and
her
sails
flapped
next
morning
while
a
crowd
gazed
over
the
walls
with
anxious
curiosity
the
worthy
husband
who
had
thus
left
his
spouse
that
he
might
carry
my
wet
boat
all
slippery
with
mud
was
highly
pleased
with
a
piece
which
was
the
least
i
thought
him
to
deserve
though
it
was
like
a
note
to
him
in
such
a
cheap
country
next
morning
in
the
light
of
day
we
had
a
survey
of
the
scene
of
last
night
adventure
it
was
very
amusing
to
trace
the
various
channels
we
had
groped
about
in
the
darkness
here
i
met
a
french
gentleman
of
gay
and
pleasant
manner
but
who
bemoaned
his
lot
as
secretary
of
a
great
factory
in
this
outlandish
place
instead
of
being
in
joyous
thoughtless
brilliant
paris
where
he
said
often
for
days
together
he
did
not
sleep
in
bed
but
ran
one
night
into
the
next
by
balls
theatres
and
supper
parties
he
kindly
took
me
to
see
the
great
salt
works
that
send
refined
salt
all
over
europe
this
rock
salt
is
hoisted
out
of
a
deep
mine
in
blocks
like
those
of
coal
having
been
hewn
from
the
strata
below
which
are
pierced
by
long
and
lofty
galleries
then
it
is
covered
in
tanks
by
water
which
becomes
saturated
and
is
conducted
to
flat
evaporating
pans
when
the
water
is
expelled
by
the
heat
of
great
furnaces
and
the
salt
appears
in
masses
like
salt
that
is
sold
by
weight
they
judiciously
wet
again
and
other
qualities
sold
by
measure
they
cleverly
deposit
in
crooked
crystals
so
as
to
take
up
as
much
space
as
possible
we
found
a
canal
here
and
as
the
river
was
so
shallow
i
mounted
to
the
artificial
channel
and
with
a
strong
and
fair
wind
was
soon
sailing
along
rapidly
this
canal
has
plenty
of
traffic
upon
it
and
only
a
few
locks
so
it
was
by
no
means
tedious
they
asked
for
my
card
of
permission
but
i
smiled
the
matter
off
as
before
however
an
officer
of
the
canal
who
was
walking
alongside
looked
much
more
seriously
at
the
infringement
of
rules
and
when
we
came
to
a
lock
he
insisted
we
must
produce
the
carte
as
a
last
resort
i
showed
him
the
and
then
he
at
once
gave
in
in
fact
after
he
had
laughed
at
the
culprit
caricatures
how
could
he
gravely
sentence
him
to
penalties
it
is
wonderful
how
a
few
lines
of
drawing
will
please
these
outlying
country
people
sometimes
we
gave
a
small
sketch
to
a
man
when
it
was
desirable
to
get
rid
of
him
he
was
sure
to
take
it
away
to

we

a

of

morning

brought
me
to
nancy
a
fine
old
town
with
an
archbishop
a
a
good
hotel
large
washhand
basins
drums
bugles
ices
and
all
the
other
luxuries
of
life
in
the
cathedral
there
was
more
tawdry
show
about
the
mass
than
i
ever
remarked
before
even
in
italy
at
least
thirty
celebrants
acted
in
the
performance
and
the
bowings
and
turnings
and
grimaces
of
sedate
old
men
clad
in
gorgeous
dirty
needlework
fumbling
with
trifles
and
muttering
latin
really
passed
all
bounds
they
were
an
insult
to
the
population
who
are
required
to
attend
this
vicarious
worship
and
to
accept
such
absurdities
as
the
true
interpretation
of
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
a
large
and
attentive
congregation
nearly
all
women
listened
first
to
an
eloquent
sermon
from
a
young
priest
who
glorified
an
old
saint
it
is
possible
that
the
ancient
worthy
was
a
most
respectable
monk
but
probably
he
was
when
he
lived
a
good
deal
like
the
monks
one
meets
in
the
monasteries
and
now
that
i
have
lived
pretty
frequently
with
these
gentlemen
i
must
say
it
makes
one
smile
to
think
of
canonizing
such
people
as
if
any
one
of
them
had
unapproachable
excellence
but
perhaps
this
monk
distinguished
himself
by
proper
daily
ablutions
and
so
earned
the
rare
reputation
of
being
reasonably
clean
in
the
afternoon
the
relics
of
the
monk
were
borne
through
the
streets
by
a
procession
of
some
thousand
women
and
a
few
men
these
ladies
some
hundreds
of
whom
were
dressed
in
white
muslin
and
in
two
single
ranks
chanted
as
they
slowly
marched
and
all
the
bystanders
took
off
their
hats
but
i
really
could
not
see
what
adoration
was
due
to
the
mouldering
bones
of
a
withered
friar
so
my
excellent
straw
hat
was
kept
on
my
head
but
the
french
who
live
in
public
must
have
a
public
religion
a
gregarious
worship
with
demonstrative
action
and
colours
and
sounds
deep
devotion
silent
in
its
depth
is
for
the
north
and
not
for
this
radiant
sun
though
you
will
find
that
quiet
worship
again
in
lower
latitudes
where
the
very
heat
precludes
activity
some
twenty
years
ago
one
of
the
ablest
men
of
the
university
of
cambridge
read
a
paper
on
the
influence
which
the
insular
position
and
the
climate
of
britain
has
upon
our
national
character
and
it
appeared
to
be
proved
clearly
that
this
influence
pervades
every
feature
of
our
life
in
a
french
town
like
nancy
nearly
all
the
pleasant
depend
on
the
climate
and
would
be
sadly
curtailed
by
rain
or
snow
so
again
when
a
frenchman
visits
england
and
gets
laughed
at
for
mistakes
in
our
difficult
language
and
has
to
eat
only
two
dishes
for
dinner
and
drinks
bad
coffee
and
has
no
evening
lounge
in
the
open
air
and
is
then
told
to
look
at
our
domestic
life
and
finds
he
can
not
get
an
entrance
there
for
how
very
few
french
do
enter
there
his
miseries
are
directly
caused
by
our
climate
and
no
wonder
his
impression
of
albion
is
that
we
are
all
fog
and
cotton
and
smoke
and
everything
from
nancy
we
sent
the
canoe
by
rail
to
meet
me
on
the
river
marne
and
while
the
slow
lumbered
along
i
took
the
opportunity
of
visiting
the
celebrated
camp
of
châlons
the
aldershot
of
france
an
omnibus
takes
you
from
the
railway
station
and
you
soon
enter
a
long
straggling
street
of
very
little
houses
built
badly
and
looking
as
if
one
and
all
could
be
pushed
down
by
your
hand
these
are
not
the
military
quarters
but
the
parasite
sutlers
town
which
springs
up
near
every
camp
here
is
place
solferino
and
there
rue
malakhoff
where
the
sign
of
the
inn
is
a
chinaman
having
his
pigtail
lopped
off
by
a
français
the
camp
is
in
the
middle
of
a
very
large
plain
with
plenty
of
dust
and
white
earth
which
glared
on
my
eyes
intensely
this
being
the
hottest
day
i
have
experienced
during
the
vacation
but
there
are
trees
for
shade
and
a
good
deal
of
grass
on
these
extensive
downs
where
great
armies
can
manoeuvre
and
march
past
the
emperor
as
he
sits
enthroned
under
a
bower
on
that
overlooking
all
the
permanent
buildings
for
the
troops
consist
of
about
separate
houses
substantial
airy
and
well
lighted
all
built
of
brick
and
slated
and
kept
in
good
repair
each
of
these
is
about
seventy
feet
long
twenty
broad
and
of
one
story
high
a
million
and
pounds
sterling
have
already
been
expended
on
this
camp
behind
the
quarters
are
the
soldiers
gardens
a
feature
added
lately
to
the
camps
in
england
there
were
only
a
few
thousand
soldiers
at
the
place
so
we
soon
saw
all
that
was
interesting
and
then
adjourned
to
a
restaurant
where
i
observed
about
twenty
officers
go
in
a
body
to
breakfast
this
they
did
in
a
separate
room
but
their
loud
coarse
and
outrageously
violent
conversation
really
amazed
me
the
din
was
monstrous
and
without
intermission
we
had
never
before
fallen
in
with
so
very
bad
a
specimen
of
french
manners
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
there
may
have
been
special
reasons
for
these
men
bellowing
for
half
an
hour
as
they
ate
their
breakfast
the
mess
system
has
been
tried
in
the
french
army
several
times
but
it
seems
to
fail
always
as
the
french
clubs
do
on
the
whole
it
is
not
wise
however
for
a
traveller
to
generalize
too
rapidly
upon
the
character
of
any
portion
of
a
great
people
if
he
has
not
lived
long
among
them
a
hasty
glance
may
discern
that
a
stranger
has
a
long
nose
but
you
must
have
better
acquaintance
with
him
before
you
can
truly
describe
the
character
of
your
friend
in
a
little
book
just
published
in
france
about
the
english
bar
two
facts
are
noted
that
barristers
put
the
name
of
their
inn
on
their
visiting
cards
and
that
the
temple
volunteers
are
drilled
admirably
by
a
who
wields
an
umbrella
with
a
varnished
cover
which
glances
in
the
sun
like
a
sword
another
interesting
town
in
this
department
of
france
is
rheims
spelt
reims
and
pronounced
very
nearly
rens
having
still
an
hour
or
two
free
i
went
there
and
enjoyed
the
visit
to
the
very
splendid
cathedral
it
is
one
of
the
finest
in
europe
very
old
very
large
very
rich
and
celebrated
as
the
place
of
coronation
for
the
french
sovereigns
besides
all
this
it
is
kept
in
good
order
and
is
remarkably
clean
the
outside
is
covered
with
stone
figures
most
of
them
rude
in
art
but
giving
at
a
distance
an
appearance
of
prodigal
richness
of
material
a
little
periodical
called
is
published
at
fourpence
each
number
with
a
map
of
the
department
several
woodcuts
of
notable
places
or
events
and
a
brief
history
of
the
principal
towns
concluding
with
a
of
the
statistics
of
the
department
a
publication
of
this
kind
would
i
think
be
very
useful
in
england
and
for
travellers
especially
who
could
purchase
at
the
county
town
the
particular
number
or
part
then
required
in
one
of
the
adjoining
departments
according
to
this
publication
it
appears
that
there
are
about
a
hundred
suicides
in
the
year
among
a
population
of
half
a
million
surely
this
is
an
alarming
proportion
and
what
should
we
say
if
manchester
had
to
report
men
and
women
in
one
year
who
put
themselves
to
death
but
we
are
subsiding
you
see
into
the
ordinary
tales
of
a
traveller
because
i
am
waiting
now
for
the
train
and
the
rob
roy
and
certainly
this
my
only
experience
of
widowerhood
made
me
long
again
for
the
yellow
oaken
side
of
the
boat
and
her
cedar
varnished
top
well
next
morning
here
is
the
canoe
at
epernay
arrived
all
safe
at
a
cost
of
all
safe
we
thought
at
first
but
we
soon
found
it
had
been
sadly
bruised
and
would
surely
leak
i
turned
it
upside
down
on
the
railway
platform
in
the
hot
sun
and
bought
two
candles
and
occupied
three
good
hours
in
making
repairs
and
greasing
all
the
seams
but
after
all
this
trouble
when
we
put
the
boat
into
the
marne
the
water
oozed
in
all
round
it
is
humiliating
to
sit
in
a
leaky
boat
it
is
like
a
lame
horse
or
a
crooked
gun
of
all
the
needful
qualities
of
a
boat
the
first
is
to
keep
out
the
water
so
i
stopped
at
the
first
village
and
got
a
man
to
mix
white
lead
and
other
things
and
we
carefully
worked
this
into
all
the
seams
leaving
it
to
harden
while
i
had
my
breakfast
in
the
little
auberge
close
by
the
shore
where
they
are
making
the
long
rafts
to
go
down
to
paris
and
where
hot
farmers
come
to
sip
their
bottle
of
wine
the
raft
man
was
wonderfully
proud
of
his
performance
with
the
canoe
and
he
called
out
to
each
of
his
friends
as
they
walked
past
to
give
them
its
long
history
in
short
words
when
i
paid
him
at
last
he
said
he
hoped
i
would
never
forget
that
the
canoe
had
been
thoroughly
mended
in
the
middle
of
france
at
the
village
of
but
i
really
do
not
remember
the
name
however
there
were
not
wanting
tests
of
his
workmanship
for
the
rob
roy
had
to
be
pulled
over
many
dykes
and
barriers
on
the
marne
some
of
these
were
of
a
peculiar
construction
and
were
evidently
novel
in
design
a
barrage
reached
across
the
stream
and
there
were
three
steps
or
falls
on
it
with
a
plateau
between
each
the
water
ran
over
these
steps
and
was
sometimes
only
a
few
inches
in
depth
on
the
crest
of
each
fall
where
it
had
to
descend
some
eight
or
ten
inches
at
most
this
of
course
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
the
canoe
to
pass
but
then
a
line
of
iron
posts
was
ranged
along
each
plateau
and
chains
were
tied
from
the
top
of
one
post
to
the
bottom
of
another
diagonally
and
it
will
be
understood
that
this
was
a
very
puzzling
arrangement
to
steer
through
in
a
fast
current
in
cases
of
this
sort
i
usually
got
ashore
to
reconnoitre
and
having
calculated
the
angle
at
which
we
must
enter
the
passage
obliquely
down
a
fall
and
across
its
stream
i
managed
to
get
successfully
through
several
of
these
strange
barriers
we
came
at
length
to
one
which
on
examination
i
had
to
acknowledge
was
impassable
for
the
chains
were
slack
and
there
was
only
an
inch
or
two
of
law
on
either
side
of
the
difficult
course
through
them
illustration
the
chain
barrier
however
a
man
happened
to
see
my
movements
and
the
canoe
and
soon
he
called
some
dozen
of
his
fellow
navvies
from
their
work
to
look
at
the
navigator
the
captain
was
therefore
incited
by
these
spectators
to
try
the
passage
and
i
mentally
resolved
at
any
rate
to
be
cool
and
placid
however
much
discomfiture
was
to
be
endured
the
boat
was
steered
to
the
very
best
of
my
power
but
the
bow
of
the
canoe
swerved
an
inch
in
the
swift
oblique
descent
and
instantly
it
got
locked
in
the
chains
while
i
quietly
got
out
whistling
an
air
in
slow
time
and
then
in
the
water
with
all
my
clothes
on
i
steadily
lifted
the
boat
through
the
iron
network
and
got
into
her
dripping
wet
but
trying
to
behave
as
if
it
were
only
the
usual
thing
the
navvies
cheered
a
long
and
loud
bravo
but
i
felt
somewhat
ashamed
of
having
yielded
to
the
desire
for
ignorant
applause
and
when
finally
round
the
next
corner
i
got
out
and
changed
my
wet
things
a
wiser
and
a
sadder
man
but
dry
this
part
of
the
river
is
in
the
heart
of
the
champagne
country
and
all
the
softly
swelling
hills
about
are
thickly
covered
by
vineyards
the
vine
for
champagne
is
exceedingly
small
and
grows
round
one
stick
and
the
hillside
looks
just
like
a
from
the
millions
of
these
little
rods
upright
in
the
ground
and
close
together
without
any
fence
whatever
between
the
innumerable
lots
the
grape
for
champagne
is
always
red
and
never
white
so
they
said
though
white
grapes
are
grown
for
eating
during
the
last
two
months
few
people
have
consumed
more
grapes
in
this
manner
than
the
chief
mate
of
the
rob
roy
canoe
on
one
of
these
hills
we
noticed
the
house
of
madame
clicquot
whose
name
has
graced
many
a
cork
of
champagne
bottles
and
of
bottles
not
champagne
the
vineyards
of
ai
near
epernay
are
the
most
celebrated
for
their
wine
after
the
bottles
are
filled
they
are
placed
neck
downwards
and
the
sediment
collects
near
the
cork
each
bottle
is
then
uncorked
in
this
position
and
the
confined
gas
forces
out
a
little
of
the
wine
with
the
sediment
while
a
skilful
man
dexterously
replaces
the
cork
when
this
sediment
has
been
expelled
one
would
think
that
only
a
very
skilful
man
can
perform
such
a
feat
when
the
bottles
are
stored
in
caves
or
vast
cellars
the
least
change
of
temperature
causes
them
to
burst
by
hundreds
sometimes
of
the
bottles
explode
in
this
manner
and
it
is
said
that
the
renowned
madame
clicquot
lost
in
the
hot
autumn
of
before
sufficient
ice
could
be
fetched
from
paris
to
cool
her
spacious
cellars
every
year
about
fifty
million
bottles
of
genuine
champagne
are
made
in
france
and
no
one
can
say
how
many
more
millions
of
bottles
of
french
champagne
are
imbibed
every
year
by
a
confiding
world
the
marne
is
a
large
and
deep
river
and
its
waters
are
kept
up
by
barriers
every
few
miles
it
is
rather
troublesome
to
pass
these
by
taking
the
boat
out
and
letting
it
down
on
the
other
side
and
in
crossing
one
of
them
i
gave
a
serious
blow
to
the
stern
of
the
canoe
against
an
iron
bar
this
blow
started
four
planks
from
the
sternpost
and
revealed
to
me
also
that
the
whole
frame
had
suffered
from
the
journey
at
night
on
an
open
truck
however
as
my
own
ship
carpenter
was
on
board
and
had
nails
and
screws
we
soon
managed
to
make
all
tight
again
and
by
moonlight
came
to
dormans
where
i
got
two
men
to
carry
the
boat
as
usual
to
an
hotel
and
had
the
invariable
run
of
visitors
from
that
time
until
everybody
went
to
bed
it
is
curious
to
remark
the
different
names
by
which
the
canoe
has
been
called
and
among
these
the
following
the
soldiers
who
have
been
in
the
crimea
call
it
thus
low
german
jacht
danish
jaht
from
jagen
to
ride
quickly
properly
a
boat
drawn
by
horses
several
people
have
spoken
of
it
as
à
for
in
the
centre
of
france
they
have
never
seen
a
steamboat
but
the
usual
name
with
the
common
people
is
and
among
the
educated
people
or
this
last
as
we
call
a
dangerous
boat
a
coffin
or
sudden
death
an
early
start
next
morning
found
me
slipping
along
with
a
tolerable
current
and
under
sail
before
a
fine
fresh
breeze
but
with
the
same
unalterable
blue
sky
i
had
several
interesting
conversations
with
farmers
and
others
riding
to
market
along
the
road
which
here
skirts
the
river
what
most
surprises
the
frenchman
is
that
a
traveller
can
possibly
be
happy
alone
not
one
hour
have
i
had
of
and
however
selfish
it
may
seem
it
is
true
that
for
this
sort
of
journey
i
prefer
to
travel
entirely
pleasant
trees
and
pretty
gardens
are
here
on
every
side
in
plenty
but
where
are
the
houses
of
the
gentlemen
of
france
and
where
are
the
french
gentlemen
themselves
this
is
a
difference
between
france
and
england
which
can
not
fail
to
knock
the
observant
traveller
as
artemus
ward
would
say
the
notable
absence
of
country
seats
during
hours
and
hours
of
passage
along
the
best
routes
whereas
in
england
the
prospect
from
almost
every
hill
of
woodland
would
have
a
great
house
at
the
end
of
its
vista
and
the
environs
of
every
town
would
stretch
into
outworks
of
villas
smiling
in
the
sun
the
french
have
ways
and
fashions
which
are
not
ours
but
their
nation
is
large
enough
to
entitle
them
to
a
standard
of
their
own
just
as
the
americans
with
so
great
a
people
agreed
on
the
matter
may
surely
claim
liberty
to
speak
with
a
twang
and
to
write
of
a
plow
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
say
we
britons
are
a
silent
people
compared
with
the
french
or
americans
at
some
hundred
sittings
of
the
table
in
both
these
countries
i
have
found
more
of
dull
dead
silence
than
in
england
at
our
inns
an
englishman
accustomed
only
to
the
pleasant
chat
of
a
domestic
dinner
feels
ill
at
ease
when
dining
with
strangers
and
so
he
notices
their
silence
all
the
more
but
the
french
table
not
in
the
big
barrack
hotels
for
english
tourists
we
have
before
remarked
upon
has
as
little
general
conversation
and
an
american
one
has
far
less
than
in
england
here
in
france
come
six
or
seven
men
to
dine
they
put
the
napkin
kept
for
each
from
yesterday
and
recognized
by
the
knots
they
tied
on
it
up
to
their
chins
like
the
pinafore
of
a
baby
and
wipe
plate
fork
and
spoons
with
the
other
end
and
eat
bits
and
scraps
of
many
dishes
and
scrape
their
plates
almost
clean
and
then
depart
and
not
one
word
has
been
uttered
then
again
there
is
the
vaunted
french
climate
bright
sun
no
doubt
but
forget
not
that
it
is
so
very
bright
as
to
compel
all
rooms
to
be
darkened
from
ten
to
four
each
day
at
noon
the
town
is
like
a
cemetery
no
one
thinks
of
walking
riding
or
looking
out
of
his
window
in
the
heat
from
seven
to
nine
in
the
morning
and
from
an
hour
before
sunset
to
any
time
you
please
at
night
the
open
air
is
delicious
but
i
venture
to
say
that
in
a
week
of
common
summer
weather
we
see
more
of
the
sun
in
england
than
in
france
for
we
seldom
have
so
much
of
it
at
once
as
to
compel
us
to
close
our
eyes
against
its
fierce
rays
in
fact
the
sensation
of
life
in
the
south
after
eleven
in
the
morning
is
that
of
for
the
cool
and
so
day
after
day
is
a
continual
reaching
forward
to
something
about
to
come
whereas
an
english
day
of
sunshine
is
an
enjoyable
present
from
beginning
to
end
once
more
let
it
be
remembered
that
twilight
lasts
only
for
half
an
hour
in
the
sunny
south
that
delicious
season
of
musing
and
long
shadows
is
a
characteristic
of
the
northern
latitudes
which
very
few
southerners
have
ever
experienced
at
all
the
run
down
the
marne
for
about
miles
was
a
pleasant
part
of
the
voyage
but
seldom
so
exciting
in
adventure
as
the
paddling
on
unknown
waters
long
days
of
work
could
therefore
be
now
well
endured
for
constant
exercise
had
trained
the
body
and
a
sort
of
instinct
was
enough
when
thus
educated
by
experience
to
direct
the
mind
therefore
the
rob
roy
paddle
was
in
my
hands
for
ten
hours
at
a
time
without
weariness
and
sometimes
even
for
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
after
a
comfortable
night
at
chateau
thierry
in
the
elephant
hotel
which
is
close
to
the
water
i
took
my
canoe
down
from
the
hayloft
to
which
it
had
been
hoisted
and
once
more
launched
her
on
the
river
the
current
gradually
increased
and
the
vineyards
gave
place
to
forest
trees
see
there
are
the
rafts
some
of
casks
lashed
together
with
osiers
some
of
planks
others
of
hewn
logs
and
others
of
great
rough
trees
there
is
a
straw
hut
on
them
for
the
captain
cabin
and
the
crew
will
have
a
stiff
fortnight
work
to
drag
push
and
steer
this
congeries
of
wood
on
its
way
to
the
seine
the
labour
spent
merely
in
adjusting
and
securing
the
parts
is
enormous
but
labour
of
that
kind
costs
little
here
further
on
there
is
a
large
flock
of
sheep
conducted
to
the
river
to
drink
in
the
orthodox
pastoral
manner
of
but
let
us
confess
it
they
were
also
driven
by
the
sagacious
shepherd
dogs
who
seem
to
know
perfectly
that
the
woolly
multitude
has
come
precisely
to
drink
and
therefore
the
dogs
cleverly
press
forward
each
particular
sheep
until
it
has
got
a
place
by
the
cool
brink
of
the
water
in
the
next
quiet
bay
a
village
maid
drives
her
cow
to
the
river
and
chats
across
the
water
with
another
also
leading
in
a
cow
to
wade
knee
deep
and
to
dip
its
broad
nose
and
lift
it
gently
again
from
the
cool
stream
on
the
road
alongside
is
a
funny
little
waggon
and
a
whole
family
are
within
this
concern
is
actually
drawn
along
by
a
goat
its
little
kid
skips
about
for
the
time
of
toil
has
not
yet
come
to
the
youngling
and
it
may
gambol
now
but
here
is
the
bridge
of
nogent
so
i
leave
my
boat
in
charge
of
an
old
man
and
give
positive
pleasure
to
the
cook
at
the
auberge
by
ordering
a
breakfast
saints
portraits
adorn
the
walls
and
a
sampler
worked
by
some
little
girl
with
only
letters
in
the
alphabet
for
the
w
is
as
yet
ignored
in
classic
grammars
though
it
has
now
to
be
constantly
used
in
the
common
books
and
newspapers
why
they
even
adopt
our
sporting
terms
and
you
see
in
a
paper
that
such
a
race
was
only
un
walkover
and
that
another
was
likely
to
be
un
dead
heat
suddenly
in
my
quiet
paddling
here
the
sky
was
shaded
and
on
looking
up
amazed
i
found
a
cloud
at
last
after
six
weeks
of
brilliant
blue
and
scorching
glare
one
fold
of
the
fleecy
curtain
has
been
drawn
over
the
sun
the
immediate
effect
of
this
cooler
sky
was
very
invigorating
though
after
weeks
of
hot
glare
reflected
upwards
again
into
the
face
from
the
water
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
to
be
always
in
a
blaze
of
light
for
much
of
the
inconvenience
of
it
was
avoided
by
a
plan
which
will
be
found
explained
in
the
appendix
with
some
other
hints
to
boating
men
the
day
went
pleasantly
now
and
with
only
the
events
of
ordinary
times
which
need
not
be
recounted
the
stream
was
steady
the
banks
were
peopled
and
many
a
countryman
stopped
to
look
at
the
canoe
as
she
glided
past
with
the
captain
socks
and
canvas
shoes
on
the
deck
behind
him
for
this
was
his
for
wet
clothes
now
and
then
a
was
seen
and
there
were
several
canoes
at
some
of
the
towns
but
all
of
them
and
open
and
desperately
unsafe
well
named
perissoirs
some
of
these
were
made
of
metal
the
use
of
this
is
to
be
a
great
mistake
for
any
boat
under
ten
tons
in
all
such
cases
it
is
much
heavier
than
wood
of
the
same
strength
considering
the
strains
which
a
boat
must
expect
to
undergo
la
ferté
sous
jouarre
is
the
long
name
of
the
next
there
are
several
towns
called
by
the
name
la
ferté
la
fortifié
which
in
some
measure
corresponds
with
the
termination
caster
or
cester
of
english
names
millstones
are
the
great
specialty
of
this
la
ferté
a
good
millstone
costs
and
there
is
a
large
exportation
of
them
the
material
has
the
very
convenient
property
of
not
requiring
to
be
chipped
into
holes
as
these
exist
in
this
stone
naturally
at
la
ferté
i
put
the
boat
into
a
hayloft
how
often
it
has
occupied
this
elevated
lodgings
amongst
its
various
adventures
and
at
dinner
with
me
there
is
an
intelligent
and
hungry
bourgeois
from
paris
with
his
vulgar
and
hearty
wife
and
opposite
to
them
the
gossip
of
the
town
who
kept
rattling
on
the
stupid
endless
of
doings
sayings
failings
and
earnings
some
amusement
however
resulted
from
the
collision
of
two
gossips
at
our
table
of
four
guests
for
while
the
one
always
harped
upon
family
tales
of
la
ferté
its
local
statistics
and
the
minute
sayings
of
its
people
the
other
kept
struggling
to
turn
our
thoughts
to
shoes
and
slippers
for
he
was
a
commercial
traveller
with
a
cartful
of
boots
to
sell
but
after
all
how
much
of
our
conversation
in
better
life
is
only
of
the
same
kind
though
about
larger
or
at
any
rate
different
things
what
might
sound
trifles
to
our
british
cabinet
would
be
the
loftiest
politics
of
honolulu
when
we
started
at
eight
next
day
i
felt
an
unaccountable
languor
my
arms
were
tired
and
my
energy
seemed
for
the
first
time
deficient
this
was
the
result
of
a
week
hard
exercise
and
of
a
sudden
change
of
wind
to
the
south
give
me
our
english
climate
for
real
hard
work
to
prosper
in
one
generally
associates
the
north
wind
with
cool
and
bracing
air
and
certainly
in
the
mediterranean
it
is
the
change
of
wind
to
the
south
the
hated
that
enervates
the
traveller
at
once
but
this
north
wind
on
the
marne
came
over
a
vast
plain
of
arid
land
heated
by
two
months
of
scorching
sun
whereas
the
breezes
of
last
week
though
from
the
east
had
been
tempered
in
passing
over
the
mountains
of
the
vosges
miles
lay
before
me
to
be
accomplished
before
arriving
at
my
for
sunday
and
it
was
not
a
pleasant
prospect
to
contemplate
with
stiff
muscles
in
the
shoulders
however
after
twelve
miles
i
found
that
about
twenty
miles
in
turnings
of
the
river
could
be
cut
off
by
putting
the
boat
on
a
cart
and
thus
a
league
of
walking
and
of
payment
solved
the
difficulty
the
old
man
with
his
cart
was
interesting
to
talk
to
and
we
spoke
about
those
deep
subjects
which
are
of
common
interest
to
all
at
a
turn
in
the
road
we
came
upon
a
cart
overturned
and
with
a
little
crowd
round
it
while
the
earth
was
covered
with
a
great
pool
of
what
seemed
to
be
blood
but
was
only
wine
the
cart
had
struck
a
tree
and
the
on
it
instantly
burst
which
so
frightened
the
horse
that
he
overset
the
cart
the
rob
roy
was
soon
in
the
water
again
and
the
scenery
had
now
become
much
more
enjoyable
i
found
an
old
soldier
at
a
ferry
who
fetched
me
a
bottle
of
wine
and
then
he
and
his
wife
sat
in
their
leaky
flat
boat
and
became
very
great
friends
with
the
englishman
he
had
been
at
the
taking
of
constantine
in
algeria
a
place
which
really
does
look
quite
impossible
to
be
taken
by
storm
but
the
appearance
of
a
fortress
is
deceptive
except
to
the
learned
in
such
matters
who
would
think
that
comorn
in
hungary
is
stronger
than
constantine
when
you
get
near
comorn
there
is
nothing
to
see
and
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
that
it
was
able
to
resist
so
long
the
breeze
soon
freshened
till
i
hoisted
my
sails
and
was
fairly
wafted
on
to
meaux
so
that
after
all
the
day
begun
with
forebodings
became
as
easy
and
as
pleasant
as

rest

in

the

of

down

then
the

of

reflected
beautifully
in

and
then
the
wondrous

with

its

and
its

adjourn

it
seems
to
be

to
exhibit
some
of

from

and
there
is
much
cheering
as
the

illumines
the
whole

assembled

i
have
noticed
that
the
last
sound
to
give
way
to
the
stillness
of
the
night
in
a
village
is
that
of
the
blacksmith
hammer
which
is
much
more
heard
abroad
than
at
home
perhaps
this
is
because
much
of
their
execrable
french
ironwork
is
made
in
each
town
whereas
in
england
it
is
manufactured
by
machinery
in
great
quantities
and
at
special
places
at
any
rate
after
travelling
on
the
continent
long
enough
to
become
calm
and
observant
seeing
hearing
and
we
may
add
scenting
all
around
the
picture
in
the
mind
is
full
of
blue
dresses
white
stones
jingling
of
bells
and
the
cling
cling
of
the
never
idle
blacksmith
this
town
of
meaux
has
a
bridge
with
houses
on
it
and
great
filling
up
the
arches
as
they
used
to
do
in
old
pleasant
gardens
front
the
river
and
cafés
glitter
there
at
night
these
are
not
luxuries
but
positive
necessaries
of
life
for
the
frenchman
and
it
is
their
absence
abroad
which
we
believe
is
one
chief
cause
of
his
being
so
bad
a
colonist
for
the
frenchman
has
only
the
expression
with
me
for
home
and
no
word
for
wife
but
woman
the
cathedral
of
meaux
is
grand
and
old
and
see
how
they
masquerade
the
service
in
it
look
at
the
gaunt
suisse
with
his
kept
on
in
church
with
his
sword
and
spear
the
twenty
priests
and
twelve
boys
intone
to
about
as
many
hearers
a
monk
escorted
through
the
church
makes
believe
to
sprinkle
holy
water
on
all
sides
from
that
dirty
plasterer
brush
and
then
two
boys
carry
on
their
shoulders
a
huge
round
loaf
the
pain
benit
which
after
fifty
bowings
is
blessed
and
escorted
back
to
be
cut
up
and
is
then
given
in
morsels
to
the
congregation
these
endless
ceremonies
are
the
meshes
of
the
net
of
popery
and
they
are
well
woven
to
catch
many
frenchmen
who
must
have
action
show
the
visible
tangible
outside
whatever
may
be
meant
by
it
this
service
sets
one
some
form
there
must
be
in
worship
one
may
suppose
indeed
that
perfect
spirit
can
adore
god
without
attitude
or
even
any
sequence
or
change
yet
in
the
bible
we
hear
of
seraphs
veiling
their
bodies
with
their
wings
and
of
elders
prostrate
at
certain
times
and
saints
that
have
a
litany
even
in
heaven
mortals
must
have
some
form
of
adoration
but
there
is
the
question
how
much
and
on
this
great
point
how
many
wise
and
foolish
men
have
written
books
without
end
or
scarcely
any
effect
the
riverside
was
a
good
place
for
a
quiet
sunday
walk
here
a
flock
of
sheep
had
come
to
drink
and
nibble
at
the
flowers
hanging
over
the
water
and
the
shepherd
stood
looking
on
while
his
dogs
rushed
backward
and
forward
yearning
for
some
sheep
to
do
wrong
that
their
dog
service
might
be
required
to
prevent
or
to
punish
naughty
conduct
this

inquires
whether

how
large
our
legs
of

are
and
if
we
have
and
are
there
any

meanwhile
at
the
hotel
the
marriage
party
kept
on
breakfasting
even
until
four
and
songs
were
sung
the
french
as
a
people
do
not
excel
in
vocal
music
either
in
tone
or
in
harmony
but
then
they
are
precise
in
time
afloat
again
next
morning
and
quite
refreshed
we
prepared
for
a
long
day
work
the
stream
was
now
clear
and
the
waving
tresses
of
dark
green
weeds
gracefully
curved
under
water
while
islands
amid
deep
shady
bays
varied
the
landscape
above
i
saw
a
canal
lock
open
and
paddled
in
merely
for
variety
passing
soon
into
a
tunnel
in
the
middle
of
which
there
was
a
huge
boat
fixed
and
nobody
with
it
the
boat
exactly
filled
the
tunnel
and
the
men
had
gone
to
their
dinner
so
i
had
first
to
drag
their
huge
boat
out
and
then
the
canoe
proudly
glided
into
daylight
having
a
whole
tunnel
to
itself
at
lagny
where
we
were
to
breakfast
i
left
my
boat
with
a
nice
old
gentleman
who
was
fishing
in
a
nightcap
and
spectacles
and
he
assured
me
he
would
stop
there
two
hours
but
when
i
scrambled
back
to
it
through
the
mill
the
miller
men
amazed
among
their
wholesome
dusty
sacks
the
disconsolate
rob
roy
was
found
to
be
all
alone
the
first
time
she
had
been
left
in
a
town
an
unprotected
female
to
escape
a
long
serpent
wind
of
the
river
we
entered
another
canal
and
found
it
about
a
foot
deep
with
clear
water
flowing
pleasantly
this
seemed
to
be
very
fortunate
and
it
was
enjoyed
most
thoroughly
for
a
few
miles
little
knowing
what
was
to
come
presently
weeds
began
then
clumps
of
great
rushes
then
large
bushes
and
trees
all
growing
with
thick
grass
in
the
water
and
at
length
this
got
so
dense
that
the
prospect
before
me
was
precisely
like
a
very
large
hayfield
with
grass
four
feet
high
all
ready
to
be
mowed
but
which
had
to
be
mercilessly
rowed
through
this
on
a
hot
day
without
wind
and
in
a
long
vista
unbroken
by
a
man
or
a
house
or
anything
lively
was
rather
daunting
but
we
had
gone
too
far
to
recede
with
honour
and
so
by
dint
of
pushing
and
working
i
actually
got
the
boat
through
some
miles
of
this
novel
obstruction
known
only
this
summer
and
brought
her
safe
and
sound
again
to
the
river
at
one
place
there
was
a
bridge
over
this
wet
marsh
and
two
men
happened
to
be
going
over
it
as
the
canoe
came
near
they
soon
called
to
some
neighbours
and
the
row
of
spectators
exhibited
the
faculty
so
notable
in
french
people
and
so
rarely
found
with
us
that
of
being
able
to
keep
from
laughing
right
out
at
a
foreigner
in
an
awkward
case
the
absurd
sight
of
a
man
paddling
a
boat
amid
miles
of
thick
rushes
was
indeed
a
severe
test
of
courteous
gravity
however
i
must
say
that
the
labour
required
to
penetrate
this
marsh
was
far
less
than
one
would
suppose
from
the
appearance
of
the
place
the
sharp
point
of
the
boat
entered
and
its
smooth
sides
followed
through
hedges
as
it
were
of
aquatic
plants
and
on
the
whole
and
after
all
was
done
i
preferred
the
trouble
and
muscular
effort
required
then
to
that
of
the
monotonous
calm
of
usual
canal
sailing
illustration
canal
miseries
fairly
in
the
broad
river
again
the
rob
roy
came
to
neuilly
and
it
was
plain
that
my
sunday
rest
had
enabled
over
thirty
miles
to
be
accomplished
without
any
fatigue
at
the
end
with
some
hesitation
we
selected
an
inn
on
the
the
canoe
was
taken
up
to
it
and
put
on
a
table
in
a
while
my
own
bed
was
in
a
garret
where
one
could
not
stand
upright
the
only
occasion
where
i
have
been
badly
housed
and
pray
let
no
one
be
misled
by
the
name
of
this
abode
the
jolly
rowers
next
day
the
river
flowed
fast
again
and
numerous
islands
made
the
channels
difficult
to
find
the
worst
of
these
difficulties
is
that
you
can
not
prepare
for
them
no
map
gives
any
just
idea
of
your
route
the
people
on
the
river
itself
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
its
navigation
for
instance
in
starting
my
landlord
told
me
that
in
two
hours
we
should
reach
paris
after
ten
miles
an
intelligent
man
said
distance
from
paris
it
is
six
hours
from
here
while
a
third
informed
me
a
little
further
on
it
is
just
three
leagues
and
a
half
from
this
spot
the
banks
were
now
dotted
with
villas
and
numerous
were
moored
at
neat
little
stairs
the
vast
number
of
these
boats
quite
astonished
me
and
the
more
so
as
very
few
of
them
were
ever
to
be
seen
in
actual
use
the
french
are
certainly
ingenious
in
their
but
more
of
ingenuity
than
of
practical
exercise
is
seen
on
the
water
on
several
rivers
we
remarked
the
walking
machine
in
which
a
man
can
walk
on
the
water
by
fixing
two
small
boats
on
his
feet
a
curious
mode
of
rowing
with
your
face
to
the
bows
has
lately
been
invented
by
a
frenchman
and
it
is
described
in
the
appendix
we
stopped
to
breakfast
at
a
new
canal
cutting
and
as
there
were
many
about
i
fastened
a
stone
to
my
painter
and
took
the
boat
out
into
the
middle
of
the
river
and
so
left
her
moored
within
sight
of
the
arbour
where
i
sat
and
also
within
sight
of
the
boys
who
gazed
for
hours
with
wistful
looks
on
the
tiny
craft
and
its
fluttering
flag
their
desire
to
handle
as
well
as
to
see
is
only
natural
for
these
little
fellows
and
therefore
if
the
lads
behave
well
i
always
make
a
point
of
showing
them
the
whole
affair
quite
near
after
they
have
had
to
abstain
from
it
so
long
as
a
forbidden
pleasure
strange
that
this
quick
curiosity
of
french
boys
does
not
ripen
more
of
them
into
travellers
but
it
soon
gets
expended
in
trifling
details
of
a
narrow
circle
while
the
sober
sedate
nay
the
anglian
is
found
scurrying
over
the
world
with
a
and
pushing
his
way
in
foreign
crowds
without
one
word
of
their
language
and
all
the
while
as
merry
as
a
lark
among
the
odd
modes
of
locomotion
adopted
by
englishmen
we
have
already
mentioned
that
of
the
gentleman
travelling
in
germany
with
a
and
two
spare
horses
we
met
another
briton
who
had
made
a
tour
in
a
road
locomotive
which
he
bought
for
and
sold
again
at
the
same
price
one
more
john
bull
who
regarded
the
canoe
as
a
queer
conveyance
went
himself
abroad
on
a
velocipede
none
of
these
however
could
cross
seas
lakes
and
rivers
like
the
canoe
which
might
be
taken
wherever
a
man
could
walk
or
a
plank
could
swim
it
seemed
contrary
to
nature
that
after
thus
nearing
pretty
paris
one
back
was
now
to
be
turned
upon
it
for
hours
in
order
to
have
a
wide
vague
purposeless
voyage
into
country
parts
but
the
river
willed
it
so
for
here
a
great
curve
began
and
led
off
to
the
left
while
the
traffic
of
the
marne
went
straight
through
a
canal
to
the
right
through
a
canal
and
therefore
i
would
not
follow
it
there
the
river
got
less
and
less
in
volume
its
water
was
used
for
the
canal
and
it
could
scarcely
trickle
with
its
maimed
strength
through
a
spacious
sweep
of
real
country
life
here
we
often
got
grounded
got
entangled
in
long
mossy
weeds
got
fastened
in
overhanging
trees
and
in
fact
suffered
all
the
evils
which
the
smallest
brook
had
ever
entailed
though
this
was
a
mighty
river
the
bend
was
more
and
more
inexplicable
as
it
turned
more
round
and
round
till
my
face
was
full
in
the
sunlight
at
noon
and
i
saw
that
the
course
was
now
due
south
rustics
were
there
to
look
at
me
and
wondering
herdsmen
too
as
if
the
boat
was
in
mid
germany
instead
of
being
close
to
paris
evidently
boating
men
in
that
quarter
never
came
here
by
the
river
and
the
rob
roy
was
a
floating
on
a
stream
unused
but
the
circle
was
rounded
at
last
as
all
circles
are
however
large
they
be
and
we
got
back
to
the
common
route
to
civilization
fishing
men
and
fishing
women
and
on
the
broad
marne
once
more
so
here
i
stopped
a
bit
for
a
ponder
and
now
we
unmoor
for
the
last
time
and
enter
the
rob
roy
for
its
final
trip
the
last
few
miles
of
the
marne
and
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
rowed
and
sailed
since
we
started
from
england
i
will
not
disguise
my
feeling
of
sadness
then
and
i
wished
that
paris
was
still
another
day
distant
for
this
journey
in
a
canoe
has
been
interesting
agreeable
and
useful
though
its
incidents
may
not
be
realized
by
reading
what
has
now
been
described
the
sensation
of
novelty
freedom
health
and
variety
all
day
and
every
day
was
what
can
not
be
recited
the
close
acquaintance
with
the
people
of
strange
lands
and
the
constant
observation
of
nature
around
and
the
unremitting
attention
necessary
for
progress
all
combine
to
make
a
voyage
of
this
sort
improving
to
the
mind
thus
kept
alert
while
the
body
thoroughly
enjoys
life
when
regular
hard
exercise
in
the
open
air
dissipates
the
lethargy
of
these
warmer
climes
these
were
my
thoughts
as
i
came
to
the
seine
and
found
a
cool
bank
to
lie
upon
under
the
trees
with
my
boat
gently
rocking
in
the
ripples
of
the
stream
below
and
the
nearer
sound
of
a
great
city
telling
that
paris
was
at
hand
here
said
i
and
now
is
my
last
hour
of
life
savage
and
free
sunny
days
alone
but
not
solitary
worked
but
not
weary
as
in
a
dream
the
things
places
and
men
i
had
seen
floated
before
my
eyes
half
closed
the
panorama
was
wide
and
fair
to
the
mind
eye
but
it
had
a
tale
always
the
same
as
it
went
quickly
past
that
vacation
was
over
and
work
must
begin
up
then
for
this
is
not
a
life
of
mere
enjoyment
again
into
the
harness
of
polite
society
the
hat
the
collar
the
braces
the
gloves
the
waistcoat
the
perhaps
the
razor
certainly
the
umbrella
how
every
joint
and
limb
will
rebel
against
these
manacles
but
they
must
be
endured
the
gradual
approach
to
paris
by
gliding
down
the
seine
was
altogether
a
new
sensation
by
diligence
railway
or
steamer
you
have
nothing
like
it
not
certainly
by
walking
into
paris
along
a
dusty
road
for
now
we
are
smoothly
carried
on
a
wide
and
winding
river
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
look
and
to
listen
while
the
splendid
panorama
majestically
unfolds
villas
thicken
gardens
get
smaller
as
houses
are
closer
trees
get
fewer
as
walls
increase
barges
line
the
banks
commerce
and
its
movement
luxury
and
its
adornments
spires
and
cupolas
grow
out
of
the
dim
horizon
and
then
bridges
seem
to
float
towards
me
and
the
hum
of
life
gets
deeper
and
busier
while
the
pretty
little
prattling
of
the
river
stream
yields
to
the
roar
of
traffic
and
to
that
indescribable
thrill
which
throbs
in
the
air
around
this
the
capital
of
the
continent
the
centre
of
the
politics
the
focus
of
the
pleasure
and
the
splendour
of
the
world
in
passing
the
island
at
notre
dame
i
fortunately
took
the
proper
side
but
even
then
we
found
a
very
awkward
rush
of
water
under
the
bridges
this
was
caused
by
the
extreme
lowness
of
the
river
which
on
this
very
day
was
three
feet
lower
than
in
the
memory
of
man
the
fall
over
each
barrier
though
wide
enough
was
so
shallow
that
i
saw
at
the
last
bridge
the
crowd
above
me
evidently
calculated
upon
my
being
upset
and
they
were
nearly
right
too
the
absence
of
other
boats
showed
me
now
experienced
in
such
omens
that
some
great
difficulty
was
at
hand
but
i
also
remarked
that
by
far
the
greater
number
of
observers
had
collected
over
one
particular
arch
where
at
first
there
seemed
to
be
the
very
worst
chance
for
getting
through
by
logical
deduction
i
argued
that
must
be
the
best
arch
after
all
for
they
evidently
expect
i
will
try
it
and
with
a
horrid
presentiment
that
my
first
upset
was
to
be
at
my
last
bridge
i
boldly
dashed
forward
whirl
whirl
the
waves
and
grate
grate
my
iron
keel
but
the
rob
roy
rises
to
the
occasion
and
a
rewarding
bravo
from
the
frenchmen
above
is
answered
by
a
british
all
right
from
the
boat
below
no
town
was
so
hard
to
find
a
place
for
the
canoe
in
as
the
bright
gay
paris
i
went
to
the
floating
baths
they
would
not
have
me
we
paddled
to
the
funny
old
ship
they
shook
their
heads
we
tried
a
coal
wharf
but
they
were
only
civil
there
even
the
worthy
washerwomen
my
quondam
friends
were
altogether
callous
now
about
a
harbour
for
the
canoe
in
desperation
we
paddled
to
a
bath
that
was
being
repaired
but
when
my
boat
rounded
the
corner
it
was
met
by
a
volley
of
abuse
from
the
proprietor
for
disturbing
his
fishing
he
was
just
in
the
act
of
expecting
the
final
bite
of
a
relenting
as
we
apologized
and
told
the
rob
roy
tale
he
housed
her
there
for
the
night
and
i
shouldered
my
luggage
and
wended
my
way
to
an
hotel
here
is
meurice
with
the
homeward
tide
of
britons
from
every
alp
and
cave
of
europe
flowing
through
its
salons
here
are
the
gay
streets
too
white
to
be
looked
at
in
the
sun
and
the
theatres
under
the
trees
and
the
dandies
driving
so
stiff
in
hired
carriages
and
the
dapper
little
soldiers
and
the
gilded
cafés
yes
it
is
paris
and
more
brilliant
than
ever
i
faintly
tried
to
hope
but
pray
pardon
me
i
utterly
failed
to
believe
that
any
person
there
had
enjoyed
his
summer
months
with
such
excessive
delight
as
the
captain

to
give
first
a
description
of
the

of

although
the

were
not
prepared
until
after
much
cogitation
it
is
well
that
intending
canoists
should
have
the
benefit
of
what
experience
has
since
proved
as
to
the
faults

the
arrangements
devised

now
building
will
have
the

the

will
topple

that
the

will
be

with
a

not

should
be
semicircular
at

both
for

sake
and

the

be

so
attached
as
to
be
readily
loosened
and
made

say
times
a

and
by
cords
which
will
instantly
break
if
you
have
to
jump
out
in

this

the
most
difficult
part
of
the
equipment
to
arrange
is
inches

and
a
light
wooden
hatch
covers
the

an
arrangement
found
to
be
most
successful
a
compartment
in
the
hull
is
a
mistake
its
partition
prevents
access
to
breakages
within

arrests
the

of

and
it
can
not
be
kept

perfectly

there
should

the

must
be

whatever
to

while
aground
on

part
of

the
combing
and
the
interior
wheels
for
transport
have
been
often
suggested
but
they
would
be
useless
on
plain
ground
or
grass
you
can
readily
do
without
them
on
rocks
and
rough
ground
or
over
ditches
and
through
hedges
wheels
could
not
be
employed
and
at
all
times
they
would
be
in
the
way
bilge
pieces
are
not
required
strength
must
be
had
without
them
and
their
projections
seriously
complicate
the
difficulties
of
pushing
the
boat
over
a
pointed
rock
both
when
afloat
and
when
ashore
besides
as
they
are
not
parallel
to
the
keel
they
very
much
retard
the

speed
the

should
be
feet
long
not
more
weight

strong
with
blades
inches
broad
ends
rounded
thick
and
banded
with
copper
there
should
be
conical
cups
of
vulcanised
india
rubber
to
catch
the
dribbling
water
and
if
possible
some
plan
not
yet
devised
for
preventing
or
arresting
the
drops
from
the
paddle
ends
which
fall
on
the
deck
when
you
paddle
slowly
and
when
there
is
not
enough
centrifugal
force
to
throw
this
water
away
from
the
boat
the
painter
ought
to
be
of
the
best
flexible
rope
not
tarred
well
able
to
bear
lb
weight
more
than
feet
of
rope
is
a
constant
encumbrance
the
ends
should
be
and
secured
through
a
hole
in
the
stem
post
and
another
in
the
stern
post
so
that
either
or
both
ends
can
be
readily
cast
off
the
slack
may
be
coiled
on
deck
behind
you
there
should
be
a
back
support
of
two
wooden
slips
each
inches
by
inches
placed
like
the
side
strokes
of
the
letter
h
and
an
inch
apart
but
laced
together
with
cord
or
joined
by
a
strip
of
cloth
rest
them
against
the
edge
of
the
combing
and
so
as
to
be
free
to
yield
to
the
motion
of
the
back
at
each
stroke
without
hurting
the
spine
if
made
fast
so
as
always
to
project
they
are
much
in
the
way
of
the
painter
in
critical
times
they
may
be
hinged
below
so
as
to
fold
down
as
you
get
out
but
in
this
case
they
are
in
the
way
when
you
are
getting
in
and
wish
to
sit
down
in
an
instant
ready
for
work
the
mast
should
be
feet
long
strong
enough
to
stand
gales
without
stays
stepped
just
forward
of
the
stretcher
in
a
tube
an
inch
above
deck
and
so
as
to
be
struck
without
difficulty
in
a
squall
or
when
nearing
trees
or
a
bridge
barrier
bank
or
waterfall
or
when
going
aground
the
sail
if
a
lug
should
have
a
fore
leach
of
feet
inches
a
head
of
feet
inches
and
a
foot
of
feet
inches
yard
and
boom
of
bamboo
the
boat
can
well
stand
more
sail
than
this
at
sea
or
in
lakes
and
broad
channels
but
the
foregoing
size
for
a
lug
is
quite
large
enough
to
manage
in
stiff
breezes
and
in
narrow
rocky
tortuous
rivers
a
spritsail
would
be
better
in
some
respects
but
no
plan
has
as
yet
been
suggested
to
me
for
instantly
striking
the
sprit
without
endangering
the
deck
so
i
mean
to
use
a
lug
still
the
material
of
the
sail
should
be
strong
cotton
in
one
piece
without
any
eyelet
or
hole
whatever
but
with
a
broad
hem
enclosing
cord
all
round
a
jib
is
of
little
use
as
a
sail
it
is
apt
to
get
aback
in
sudden
turns
besides
you
must
land
either
to
set
it
or
to
take
in
its
outhaul
so
as
to
be
quite
snug
but
the
jib
does
well
to
tie
on
the
shoulders
when
they
are
turned
to
a
fierce
sun
the
boom
should
be
attached
by
a
brass
shackle
so
that
when
topped
or
folded
its
end
closes
on
the
top
of
the
mast
the
sails
with
the
boom
and
yard
should
be
rolled
up
round
the
mast
compactly
to
be
stowed
away
forward
so
that
the
end
of
the
mast
resting
on
the
stretcher
will
keep
the
roll
of
sails
out
of
the
wet
the
flag
and
its
staff
when
not
fast
at
the
by
two
metal
loops
should
fit
into
the
and
the
inches
long
should
be
light
so
as
not
to
sink
if
it
falls
overboard
as
one
of
mine
did
the
should
be
strong
and
easily
detachable
so
that
one
of
them
can
be
at
once
used
as
a
paddle
if
that
falls
overboard
they
should
come
six
inches
short
of
the
stern
end
of
a
light
seat
which
can
thus
rest
on
the
timbers
so
as
to
be
as
low
as
possible
and
its
top
should
be
of
strong
cane
the
stretcher
should
have
only
one
length
and
let
this
be
carefully
determined
after
trial
before
starting
the
two
sides
of
its
should
be
high
and
broad
while
the
middle
may
be
cut
down
to
let
the
hand
get
to
the
mast
the
stretcher
should
of
course
be
moveable
in
order
that
you
may
lie
down
with
the
legs
at
full
length
for
repose
one
brass
cleat
for
belaying
the
halyard
should
be
on
deck
about
the
middle
and
on
the
side
a
stud
on
the
other
side
and
this

will
do

rocks
and
currents
a
few
remarks
may
now
be
made
upon
the
principal
cases
in
which
rocks
and
currents
have
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
canoist
even
if
a
set
of
rules
could
be
laid
down
for
the
management
of
a
boat
in
the
difficult
parts
of
a
river
it
would
not
be
made
easier
until
practice
has
given
the
boatman
that
quick
judgment
as
to
their
application
which
has
to
be
patiently
acquired
in
this
and
other
athletic
exercises
such
as
riding
or
skating
and
even
in
walking
the
canoist
who
passes
many
hours
every
day
for
months
together
in
the
earnest
consideration
of
the
river
problems
always
set
before
him
for
solution
will
probably
feel
some
interest
in
this
attempt
to
classify
those
that
occur
most
frequently
steering
a
boat
in
a
current
among
rocks
is
not
unlike
walking
on
a
crowded
pavement
where
the
other
passengers
are
going
in
various
directions
and
at
various
speeds
and
this
operation
of
threading
your
way
in
the
streets
requires
a
great
deal
of
practice
and
not
a
few
lessons
enforced
by
collisions
to
make
a
pedestrian
thoroughly
as
a
good
man
in
a
crowd
after
years
of
walking
through
crowds
there
is
produced
by
this
education
of
the
mind
and
training
of
the
body
a
certain
power
not
possessed
by
a
novice
which
insensibly
directs
a
man
in
his
course
and
his
speed
but
still
his
judgment
has
had
insensibly
to
take
cognizance
of
many
varying
in
the
movements
of
other
people
which
must
have
their
effect
upon
each
step
he
takes
after
this
capacity
becomes
as
it
were
instinctive
or
at
any
rate
acts
almost
involuntarily
a
man
can
walk
briskly
along
at
and
without
any
distinct
thought
about
other
people
or
about
his
own
progress
he
can
safely
get
to
his
journey
end
indeed
if
he
does
begin
to
think
of
rules
or
how
to
apply
them
systematically
he
is
then
almost
sure
to
knock
up
against
somebody
else
nay
if
two
men
meet
as
they
walk
through
a
crowd
and
each
of
them
catches
the
eye
of
the
other
they
will
probably
cease
to
move
instinctively
and
with
uncertain
data
to
reason
from
a
collision
is
often
the
result
as
the
descent
of
a
current
among
rocks
resembles
a
walk
along
the
pavement
through
a
crowd
so
the
passage
a
rapid
is
even
more
strictly
in
resemblance
with
the
course
of
a
man
who
has
to
cross
a
street
where
vehicles
are
passing
at
uncertain
intervals
and
at
various
speeds
though
all
in
the
same
direction
for
it
is
plain
that
the
thing
to
be
done
is
nearly
the
same
whether
the
obstacles
as
breakers
are
fixed
and
the
current
carries
you
towards
them
or
the
obstacles
as
cabs
and
carts
are
moving
while
you
have
to
walk
through
them
on
to
cross
in
the
afternoon
requires
the
very
same
sort
of
calculation
as
the
passage
across
the
stream
in
a
rapid
on
the
rhine
the
importance
of
this
subject
of
boating
instinct
will
be
considered
sufficient
to
justify
these
remarks
when
the
canoist
has
by
much
practice
at
last
attained
to
that
desirable
proficiency
which
enables
him
to
steer
without
thinking
about
it
and
therefore
to
enjoy
the
conversation
of
other
people
on
the
bank
or
the
scenery
while
he
is
rapidly
speeding
through
rocks
eddies
and
currents
we
may
divide
the
rocks
thus
encountered
in
fast
water
into
two
classes
those
that
are
so
that
the
boat
can
float
over
them
and
which
do
not
deflect
the
direction
of
the
surface
current
those
that
are
and
so
deflect
the
current
and
do
not
allow
the
boat
to
float
over
them
the
currents
may
be
divided
into
those
that
are
equable
in
force
and
in
the
same
direction
through
the
course
to
be
steered
those
that
alter
their
direction
in
a
part
of
that
course
in
the
problems
before
the
canoist
will
be
found
the
combinations
of
every
degree
and
variety
of
these
rocks
and
currents
but
the
actual
circumstances
he
has
to
deal
with
at
any
specified
moment
may
it
is
believed
be
generally
ranged
under
one
or
other
of
the
six
cases
depicted
in
the
accompanying
woodcut
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
in
each
of
the
figures
in
the
diagram
the
current
is
supposed
to
run
towards
the
top
of
the
page
and
the
general
course
of
the
canoe
is
supposed
to
be
with
the
current
the
particular
direction
of
the
current
is
indicated
by
the
dotted
lines
the
rocks
when
shaded
are
supposed
to
be
and
when
not
shaded
they
are
thus
the
current
is
uniform
in
figs
and
it
is
otherwise
in
figs
the
rocks
are
all
sunk
in
figs
and
whereas
in
figs
and
there
are
breakers
the
black
line
in
these
figures
and
in
all
the
others
shows
the
proper
course
of
the
centre
of
the
boat
and
it
is
well
to
habituate
oneself
to
make
the
course
such
as
that
this
line
shall
never
be
nearer
to
the
rock
than
of
the
boat
length
the
simplest
case
that
can
occur
is
when
the
canoe
is
merely
floating
without
way
through
a
current
and
the
current
bears
it
near
a
rock
if
this
be
a
breaker
the
current
being
deflected
will
generally
carry
the
boat
to
one
side
the
steering
in
such
cases
is
so
easy
and
its
frequent
occurrence
gives
so
much
practice
that
no
more
need
be
said
about
it
but
if
the
rock
be
a
sunk
rock
and
if
it
be
not
quite
plain
from
the
appearance
of
the
water
that
there
is
depth
enough
over
the
rock
to
float
the
boat
then
it
is
necessary
to
pass
either
above
the
rock
as
in
fig
or
below
it
as
in
fig
a
few
days
practice
is
not
thrown
away
if
the
canoist
seizes
every
opportunity
of
performing
under
easy
circumstances
feats
which
may
at
other
times
have
to
be
done
under
necessity
and
which
would
not
be
so
well
done
if
attempted
then
for
the
first
time
let
him
therefore
as
soon
as
possible
become
adept
in
crossing
above
or
below
a
single
sunk
rock
with
his
bow
pointed
to
any
angle
of
the
semicircle
before
next
we
have
to
consider
the
cases
in
which
more
than
one
rock
will
have
to
be
avoided
now
however
great
the
number
of
the
rocks
may
be
they
can
be
divided
into
sets
of
three
and
in
each
of
the
figures
it
is
supposed
that
for
reasons
which
may
be
different
in
each
case
but
always
sufficient
the
canoe
has
to
pass
between
rocks
and
and
then
between
and
but
must
not
pass
otherwise
between
and
in
fig
the
course
is
below
and
above
being
a
combination
of
the
instance
in
fig
with
that
in
fig
the
precise
angle
to
the
line
of
the
course
which
the
boat
longer
axis
ought
to
have
will
depend
upon
what
is
to
be
done
next
after
passing
between
and
and
hence
the
importance
of
being
able
to
effect
the
passages
in
fig
and
fig
with
the
axis
at
any
required
angle
we
may
next
suppose
that
one
of
the
three
rocks
say
as
in
fig
is
a
breaker
which
will
deflect
the
current
as
indicated
by
the
dotted
stream
lines
and
it
will
then
be
necessary
to
modify
the
angle
of
the
boat
axis
though
the
boat
centre
has
to
be
kept
in
the
same
course
as
before
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
if
were
a
breaker
the
angle
would
be
influenced
in
another
manner
and
that
if
were
a
breaker
the
angle
at
which
the
boat
should
emerge
from
the
group
of
rocks
would
be
influenced
by
the
stream
from
also
but
it
is
only
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
all
the
combinations
and
permutations
of
breakers
and
sunk
rocks
need
not
be
separately
discussed
they
may
be
met
by
the
experience
obtained
in
one
case
of
each
class
of
circumstances
fig
represents
a
over
the
group
of
three
rocks
this
is
a
very
deceptive
case
for
it
looks
so
easy
that
at
first
it
is
likely
to
be
treated
carelessly
if
the
boat
were
supposed
to
be
a
substance
floating
but
without
weight
it
would
have
its
direction
of
motion
instantly
altered
by
that
of
the
current
but
the
boat
has
weight
and
as
it
has
velocity
that
of
the
current
even
if
the
boat
is
not
urged
also
by
the
paddle
so
as
to
have
way
through
the
water
therefore
it
will
have
and
the
tendency
will
be
to
continue
the
motion
in
a
straight
line
instead
of
a
curve
guided
solely
by
the
current
in
all
these
cases
therefore
it
will
be
found
sometimes
inexplicably
unless
with
these
considerations
that
the
boat
upon
passing
between
and
where
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
the
hypothesis
we
have
started
with
and
if
it
effects
a
compromise
by
running
upon
this
is
by
no
means
satisfactory
this
class
of
cases
includes
all
those
in
which
the
river
makes
a
quick
turn
round
a
rock
or
a
tongue
where
the
boundary
formed
by
the
rock
on
the
outer
bend
of
the
stream
is
a
solid
bank
or
a
fringe
of
growing
trees
or
of
faggots
artificially
built
as
a
protection
against
the
erosion
of
the
water
this
case
occurs
therefore
very
frequently
in
some
fast
rivers
say
at
least
a
hundred
times
in
a
day
work
and
perhaps
no
test
of
a
man
experience
and
capacity
as
a
canoist
is
more
decisive
than
his
manner
of
steering
round
a
fast
sharp
bend
the
tendency
of
the
canoist
in
such
cases
is
always
to
bring
the
boat
round
by
paddling
forward
with
the
outer
hand
thereby
adding
to
the
way
and
making
the
force
of
the
current
in
its
circular
turn
less
powerful
relatively
whereas
the
proper
plan
is
to
back
with
the
inner
hand
and
so
to
stop
all
way
in
the
direction
of
the
boat
length
and
to
give
the
current
its
full
force
on
the
boat
repeated
lessons
are
needed
before
this
is
learned
thoroughly
the
case
we
have
last
remarked
upon
is
made
easier
if
either
or
is
a
breaker
but
it
is
very
much
increased
in
difficulty
if
the
rock
is
a
breaker
or
is
a
strong
tongue
of
bank
and
so
deflects
the
current
outwards
at
this
critical
point
the
difficulty
is
often
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
water
inside
of
the
curve
of
the
stream
may
be
shoal
and
so
the
paddle
on
that
side
strikes
the
bottom
or
grinds
along
it
in
backing
when
the
curve
is
all
in
deep
water
and
there
is
a
pool
after
the
boat
ought
not
to
be
turned
too
quickly
in
endeavouring
to
avoid
the
rock
else
it
will
sometimes
then
enter
the
eddy
below
which
runs
up
stream
sometimes
for
fifty
yards
in
such
a
case
the
absurd
position
you
are
thereby
thrown
into
naturally
causes
you
to
struggle
to
resist
or
stem
this
current
but
i
have
found
after
repeated
trials
of
every
plan
i
could
think
of
that
if
once
the
back
current
has
taken
the
canoe
it
is
best
to
let
the
boat
swing
with
the
eddy
so
as
to
make
an
entire
circuit
until
the
bow
can
come
back
towards
and
below
it
when
the
nose
of
the
boat
may
be
again
thrust
into
the
main
stream
which
will
now
turn
the
boat
round
again
to
its
proper
course
much
time
and
labour
may
be
spent
uselessly
in
a
wrong
and
obstinate
contest
with
an
eddy
in
fig
where
the
three
rocks
are
in
a
straight
line
and
the
middle
one
is
a
breaker
an
instance
is
given
when
the
proper
course
must
be
kept
by
during
the
first
part
of
it
we
must
suppose
for
this
that
the
canoist
has
attained
the
power
of
backing
with
perfect
ease
for
it
will
be
quite
necessary
if
he
intends
to
take
his
boat
safely
through
several
hundred
combinations
of
sunk
rocks
and
breakers
presuming
this
the
case
in
fig
will
be
easy
enough
though
a
little
reflection
will
show
that
it
might
be
very
difficult
or
almost
impossible
if
the
canoist
could
give
only
a
forward
motion
to
the
boat
to
pass
most
artistically
then
through
the
group
of
rocks
in
fig
the
stern
should
be
turned
towards
as
shown
in
the
diagram
and
the
passage
across
the
current
between
and
is
to
be
effected
solely
by
backing
water
and
chiefly
in
this
case
with
the
left
hand
until
the
furthest
point
of
the
right
of
the
curve
is
reached
with
the
boat
length
still
as
before
in
the
position
represented
in
the
figure
then
the
forward
action
of
both
hands
will
take
the
canoe
speedily
through
the
passage
between
and
cases
of
this
sort
are
rendered
more
difficult
by
the
distance
of
from
the
point
above
where
you
are
situated
when
the
decision
has
to
be
made
and
in
three
instants
of
time
as
to
what
must
be
done
also
it
would
usually
be
imprudent
to
rise
in
the
boat
in
such
a
place
to
survey
the
rock
from
a
better
position
if
it
is
evident
that
the
plan
described
above
will
not
be
applicable
because
other
and
future
circumstances
will
require
the
boat
bow
to
emerge
in
the
opposite
direction
pointing
to
the
right
then
you
must
enter
forwards
and
must
back
between
and
so
as
to
be
ready
after
passing
to
drive
forward
and
to
the
right
it
is
plain
that
this
is
very
much
more
difficult
than
the
former
case
for
your
backing
now
has
to
be
done
against
the
full
stream
from
the
breaker
in
all
these
instances
the
action
of
the
wind
has
been
entirely
omitted
from
consideration
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
a
strong
breeze
materially
complicates
the
problem
before
the
canoist
this
is
especially
so
when
the
wind
is
aft
when
it
is
ahead
you
are
not
likely
to
forget
its
presence
a
strong
fair
wind
that
has
scarcely
been
felt
with
your
back
to
it
and
the
swift
stream
and
the
boat
speed
from
paddling
being
all
in
one
direction
the
breeze
will
suddenly
become
a
new
element
in
the
case
when
you
try
to
cross
above
a
rock
as
in
fig
and
find
the
wind
carries
you
broadside
on
against
all
your
calculations
nor
have
i
any
observations
to
make
as
to
sailing
among
rocks
in
a
current
the
canoe
must
be
directed
solely
by
the
paddle
in
a
long
rapid
and
in
the
other
places
the
course
to
be
steered
by
a
boat
sailing
is
the
same
as
if
it
were
being
merely
paddled
though
the
action
of
the
wind
has
to
be
carefully
taken
into
consideration
in
all
these
things
boldness
and
skill
come
only
after
lessons
of
experience
and
the
canoist
will
find
himself
ready
and
able
at
the
end
of
his
voyage
to
sail
down
a
rapid
which
he
would
have
approached
timidly
even
with
the
paddle
at
the
beginning
but
perhaps
enough
has
been
said
for
the
experienced
oarsman
while
surely
more
than
enough
has
been
said
to
shew
the
tyro
aspirant
what
varied
work
he
has
to
do
and
how
interesting
are
the
circumstances
that
will
occupy
his
attention

been
published
years
ago
and
in
many
foreign
languages
but
its
circulation
is
very
large
at
the
present
time
the
following

of
the
incidents

has
been
drawn
to
the
letters

it
may
be
interesting
to
notice
the
following
remarkable
incident
respecting
a
letter
from

the

which

saved

the

of
the

arrived
in
the

in

he
was
amazed
to
find
that
the

hold
to

the
following
notes
are
on
miscellaneous
points
we
are
sometimes
asked
about
such
a
canoe
voyage
as
this
is
it
not
very
dangerous
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
necessary
danger
in
the
descent
of
a
river
in
a
canoe
but
if
you
desire
to
make
it
as
safe
as
possible
you
must
get
out
at
each
difficult
place
and
examine
the
course
and
if
the
course
is
too
difficult
you
may
take
the
boat
past
the
danger
by
land
on
the
other
hand
if
the
excitement
and
novelty
of
finding
out
a
course
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
is
to
be
enjoyed
then
no
doubt
there
is
more
danger
to
the
boat
as
for
danger
to
the
canoist
it
is
supposed
that
he
is
well
able
to
swim
not
only
in
a
bath
when
stripped
but
when
unexpectedly
thrown
into
the
water
with
his
clothes
on
and
that
he
he
can
rely
on
this
capacity
if
this
be
so
the
chief
danger
to
him
occurs
when
he
meets
a
steamer
on
rough
water
rare
enough
on
such
a
tour
for
if
his
boat
is
upset
by
that
and
his
head
is
broken
by
the
paddle
floats
the
swimming
powers
are
futile
for
safety
the
danger
incurred
by
the
boat
is
certainly
both
considerable
and
frequent
but
nothing
short
of
the
persuasion
that
the
boat
would
be
smashed
if
a
great
exertion
is
not
made
will
incite
the
canoist
to
those
very
exertions
which
are
the
charm
of
travelling
when
spirit
strength
and
skill
are
to
be
proved
men
have
their
various
lines
of
exercise
as
they
have
of
duty
the
huntsman
may
not
understand
the
pleasures
of
a
rapid
nor
the
boatman
care
for
the
delights
of
a
bullfinch
certainly
however
the
waterman
can
say
that
a
good
horse
may
carry
a
bad
rider
well
but
that
the
best
boat
will
not
take
a
bad
boatman
through
a
mile
of
broken
water
in
each
case
there
is
perhaps
a
little
of
me
and
it
may
possibly
be
made
up
for
by
a
good
deal
of
mihi
it
has
been
said
that
the
constant
use
of
a
canoe
paddle
must
contract
the
chest
but
this
is
certainly
a
mistake
if
indeed
you
merely
dabble
each
blade
of
the
paddle
in
the
water
without
taking
the
full
length
of
the
stroke
the
shoulders
are
not
thrown
back
and
the
effect
will
be
injurious
but
exactly
the
same
is
true
if
you
scull
or
row
with
a
short
jerky
stroke
in
a
proper
use
of
the
paddle
the
arms
ought
to
be
in
turn
fully
extended
and
then
brought
well
back
so
that
the
hand
touches
the
side
and
the
chest
is
then
well
plied
in
both
directions
in
using
the
paddle
of
which
i
have
had
experience
in
canada
and
new
brunswick
with
the
indians
in
bark
canoes
and
log
canoes
there
seems
to
be
a
less
beneficial
action
on
the
pectoral
muscles
but
after
three
months
use
of
the
double
paddle
i
found
the
arms
much
strengthened
while
clothes
that
fitted
before
were
all
too
narrow
round
the
chest
when
put
on
after
this
exercise
in
shallow
water
the
paddle
should
be
clasped
lightly
so
that
if
it
strikes
the
bottom
or
a
rock
the
hand
will
yield
and
not
the
blade
be
broken
great
caution
should
be
used
when
placing
the
blade
in
advance
to
meet
a
rock
or
even
a
gravel
bank
otherwise
it
gets
jammed
in
the
rock
or
gravel
or
the
boat
overrides
it
it
is
better
in
such
a
case
to
retard
the
speed
rather
by
dragging
the
paddle
tenderly
and
always
with
its
flat
side
downwards
so
that
the
edge
does
not
get
nipped
farcôt
a
french
engineer
has
lately
exhibited
on
the
thames
a
boat
which
is
rowed
by
the
oarsman
sitting
with
his
face
to
the
bow
who
by
this
means
secures
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
canoe
that
of
seeing
where
you
are
going
to
effect
this
a
short
prop
or
mast
about
three
feet
high
is
fixed
in
the
boat
and
the
two
sculls
are
jointed
to
it
by
their
handles
while
their
weight
is
partly
sustained
by
a
strong
spiral
spring
acting
near
the
joint
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
keep
the
blade
of
the
scull
a
few
inches
from
the
surface
of
the
water
when
it
is
not
pressed
down
purposely
the
sculler
then
sits
with
his
face
towards
the
mast
and
the
bow
and
he
holds
in
each
hand
a
rod
jointed
to
the
loom
of
the
corresponding
scull
by
this
means
each
scull
is
moved
on
the
mast
as
a
fulcrum
with
the
power
applied
between
that
and
the
water
the
operation
of
feathering
is
partially
performed
and
to
facilitate
this
there
is
an
ingeniously
contrived
guide
this
invention
appears
to
be
new
but
it
is
evident
that
the
plan
retains
many
of
the
disadvantages
of
common
sculls
and
it
leaves
the
double
paddle
quite
alone
as
a
simple
means
for
propelling
a
canoe
in
narrow
or
tortuous
channels
or
where
it
has
to
meet
waves
weeds
rocks
or
trees
and
moreover
has
to
sail
however
the
muscular
power
of
the
arms
can
be
applied
with
good
effect
in
this
new
manner
and
i
found
it
not
very
difficult
to
learn
the
use
of
this
french
rowing
apparatus
which
is
undoubtedly
very
ingenious
and
deserves
a
full
trial
before
a
verdict
is
pronounced
in
a
difficult
place
where
the
boat
is
evidently
going
too
near
a
rock
the
disposition
of
the
canoist
is
to
change
the
direction
by
a
stroke
on
one
side
but
this
adds
to
the
force
with
which
a
collision
may
be
invested
it
is
often
better
to
a
stroke
on
the
other
side
and
thus
to
lessen
this
force
and
this
is
nearly
always
possible
to
be
done
even
when
the
boat
appears
to
be
simply
drifting
on
the
stream
in
fact
as
a
maxim
there
is
always
steerage
way
sufficient
to
enable
the
paddle
to
be
used
exactly
as
a
rudder
when
there
is
a
brilliant
glare
of
the
sun
and
it
is
low
and
directly
in
front
and
it
is
impossible
to
bear
its
reflection
on
the
water
a
good
plan
is
to
direct
the
bow
to
some
point
you
are
to
steer
for
and
then
observe
the
reflection
of
the
sun
on
the
cedar
deck
of
the
boat
having
done
this
you
may
lower
the
peak
of
your
hat
so
as
to
cut
off
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
and
its
reflected
rays
on
the
water
while
you
steer
simply
by
the
light
on
the
deck
when
a
great
current
moves
across
a
river
to
a
point
where
it
seems
very
unlikely
to
have
an
exit
you
may
be
certain
that
some
unusual
conformation
of
the
banks
or
of
the
river
bed
will
be
found
there
and
caution
should
be
used
in
approaching
the
place
this
however
is
less
necessary
when
the
river
is
deep
such
cross
currents
are
frequent
on
the
rhine
but
they
result
merely
from
unevenness
in
the
bottom
far
below
and
thus
we
see
how
the
rapids
most
dangerous
when
the
river
is
low
become
quite
agreeable
and
safe
in
high
flood
time
the
ripple
and
bubbles
among
weeds
are
so
totally
different
from
those
on
free
water
that
their
appearance
at
a
distance
as
a
criterion
of
the
depth
current
and
direction
of
the
channel
must
be
learned
separately
in
general
where
weeds
are
under
water
and
can
sway
or
wave
about
there
will
be
water
enough
to
pass
the
requisite
inches
backing
up
stream
against
long
weeds
is
so
troublesome
and
so
sure
to
sway
the
stern
round
athwart
stream
that
it
is
best
to
force
the
boat
forward
instead
even
if
you
have
to
get
out
and
pull
her
through
paddling
through
rushes
or
flags
or
other
plants
above
the
water
so
as
to
cut
off
a
corner
is
a
mistake
much
more
way
is
lost
then
by
the
friction
than
might
be
supposed
i
noticed
a
very
curious
across
the
rhine
below
basle
it
seemed
to
open
wide
without
swinging
and
on
coming
close
to
it
the
plan
was
found
to
be
this
the
boats
of
one
half
of
the
bridge
were
drawn
towards
the
shore
and
a
stage
connecting
them
ran
on
wheels
along
rails
inwards
from
the
river
and
up
an
incline
on
the
bank
this
system
is
ingenious
convenient
and
philosophical
boats
have
often
been
tried
for
sailing
but
their
disadvantages
are
manifest
when
the
craft
is
on
a
large
scale
though
for
they
answer
admirably
and
they
are
now
quite
fashionable
on
the
serpentine
the
double
boat
of
the
nautical
tinman
on
the
rhine
before
described
was
a
fond
conceit
but
there
are
many
boats
on
french
rivers
and
they
have
this
sole
recommendation
that
you
sit
high
up
and
so
can
fish
without
fearing
you
may
turn
the
turtle
when
the
two
hulls
are
reduced
as
much
as
possible
this
sort
of
boat
becomes
an
aquatic
walking
machine
for
one
foot
then
rests
on
each
hull
propulsion
is
obtained
either
by
linking
the
hulls
together
with
parallel
bars
moving
on
studs
while
vanes
are
on
each
side
so
as
to
act
like
fins
and
to
collapse
for
the
alternate
forward
stroke
of
each
foot
bound
to
its
hull
or
a
square
paddle
or
a
pole
works
on
the
water
or
on
the
bottom
i
have
always
noticed
that
the
proprietors
of
such
craft
are
ingenious
obstinate
men
proud
of
their
peculiar
mode
and
very
touchy
when
it
is
criticised
however
it
is
usually
best
and
it
is
fortunately
always
easy
to
paddle
away
from
them
the
hard
exercise
of
canoe
paddling
the
motion
constant
working
of
the
muscles
about
the
stomach
and
free
perspiration
result
in
good
appetite
and
pleasant
sleepiness
at
night
but
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
the
change
of
diet
and
cessation
of
exercise
will
be
apt
to
cause
derangement
in
the
whole
system
and
especially
in
the
digestion
if
the
high
condition
or
training
be
not
cautiously
lowered
into
the
humdrum
constitutionals
of
more
ordinary
life
still
i
have
found
it
very
agreeable
to
take
a
paddle
in
the
rob
roy
up
to
hammersmith
and
back
even
in
december
and
march
the
last
public
occasion
on
which
she
appeared
was
on
april
when
the
captain
offered
her
aid
to
the
chief
constructor
of
the
navy
in
the
effort
of
the
admiralty
to
launch
the
ironclad
northumberland
the
offer
was
eagerly
accepted
and
the
launch
was
accordingly
successful
the
rob
roy
has
since
departed
for
a
voyage
to
norway
and
iceland
in
the
schooner
yacht
sappho
whose
young
owner
lawton
has
promised
to
be
kind
to
her
it
is
intended
that
a
new
rob
roy
should
make
a
voyage
next
summer
with
another
canoe
called
the
robin
hood
other
pleasant
voyages
may
be
suggested
for
the
holiday
of
the
canoist
one
of
these
might
begin
with
the
thames
and
then
down
the
severn
along
the
north
coast
of
devon
and
so
by
the
river
dart
to
plymouth
another
on
the
solent
and
round
the
isle
of
wight
the
dee
might
be
descended
by
the
canoe
and
then
to
the
left
through
the
menai
straits
or
a
longer
trip
may
be
made
through
the
cumberland
lakes
by
windermere
and
the
derwent
or
from
edinburgh
by
the
forth
into
the
clyde
and
through
the
kyles
of
bute
to
oban
then
along
the
caledonian
canal
until
the
voyager
can
get
into
the
tay
for
a
swift
run
eastward
but
why
not
begin
at
gothenburg
and
pass
through
the
pretty
lakes
of
sweden
to
stockholm
and
then
skirt
the
lovely
archipelago
of
green
isles
in

of

until
you
get
to

for
one
or
other
of
such
tours
a

an

for

of
them
a

would
be
