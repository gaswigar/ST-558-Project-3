volume
the
first
account
on
february
we
started
for
the
south
to
establish
depots
and
continued
our
journey
until
april
we
formed
three
depots
and
stored
in
them
tons
of
provisions
including
hundredweight
of
seal
meat
as
there
were
no
landmarks
we
had
to
indicate
the
position
of
our
depots
by
flags
which
were
posted
at
a
distance
of
about
four
miles
to
the
east
and
west
the
first
barrier
afforded
the
best
going
and
was
specially
adapted
for
thus
on
february
we
did
miles
with
sledges
each
sledge
weighed
pounds
and
we
had
six
dogs
for
each
the
upper
barrier
barrier
surface
was
smooth
and
even
there
were
a
few
crevasses
here
and
there
but
we
only
found
them
dangerous
at
one
or
two
points
the
barrier
went
in
long
regular
undulations
the
weather
was
very
favourable
with
calms
or
light
winds
the
lowest
temperature
at
this
station
was
which
was
taken
on
march
when
we
returned
to
winter
quarters
on
february
from
a
first
trip
we
found
that
the
fram
had
already
left
us
with
joy
and
pride
we
heard
from
those
who
had
stayed
behind
that
our
gallant
captain
had
succeeded
in
sailing
her
farther
south
than
any
former
ship
so
the
good
old
fram
has
shown
the
flag
of
norway
both
farthest
north
and
farthest
south
the
most
southerly
latitude
reached
by
the
fram
was
before
the
winter
set
in
we
had
tons
of
seal
meat
in
our
winter
quarters
this
was
enough
for
ourselves
and
our
dogs
we
had
built
eight
kennels
and
a
number
of
connecting
tents
and
snow
huts
when
we
had
provided
for
the
dogs
we
thought
of
ourselves
our
little
hut
was
almost
entirely
covered
with
snow
not
till
the
middle
of
april
did
we
decide
to
adopt
artificial
light
in
the
hut
this
we
did
with
the
help
of
a
lux
lamp
of
which
gave
an
excellent
light
and
kept
the
indoor
temperature
at
about
throughout
the
winter
the
ventilation
was
very
satisfactory
and
we
got
sufficient
fresh
air
the
hut
was
directly
connected
with
the
house
in
which
we
had
our
workshop
larder
storeroom
and
cellar
besides
a
single
bathroom
and
observatory
thus
we
had
everything
within
doors
and
easily
got
at
in
case
the
weather
should
be
so
cold
and
stormy
that
we
could
not
venture
out
the
sun
left
us
on
april
and
we
did
not
see
it
again
for
four
months
we
spent
the
winter
in
altering
our
whole
equipment
which
our
depot
journeys
had
shown
to
be
too
heavy
and
clumsy
for
the
smooth
barrier
surface
at
the
same
time
we
carried
out
all
the
scientific
work
for
which
there
was
opportunity
we
made
a
number
of
surprising
meteorological
observations
there
was
very
little
snow
in
spite
of
there
being
open
water
in
the
neighbourhood
we
had
expected
to
observe
higher
temperatures
in
the
course
of
the
winter
but
the
thermometer
remained
very
low
during
five
months
temperatures
were
observed
varying
between
and
we
had
the
lowest
on
august
the
weather
was
calm
on
august
we
had
with
a
wind
of
thirteen
miles
an
hour
the
mean
temperature
for
the
year
was
we
expected
blizzard
after
blizzard
but
had
only
two
moderate
storms
we
made
many
excellent
observations
of
the
aurora
australis
in
all
parts
of
the
heavens
our
bill
of
health
was
the
best
possible
throughout
the
whole
winter
when
the
sun
returned
on
august
it
shone
upon
men
who
were
healthy
in
mind
and
body
and
ready
to
begin
the
task
that
lay
before
them
we
had
brought
the
sledges
the
day
before
to
the
of
the
southern
journey
at
the
beginning
of
september
the
temperature
rose
and
it
was
decided
to
commence
the
journey
on
september
a
party
of
eight
men
set
out
with
seven
sledges
and
ninety
dogs
provisioned
for
ninety
days
the
surface
was
excellent
and
the
temperature
not
so
bad
as
it
might
have
been
but
on
the
following
day
we
saw
that
we
had
started
too
early
the
temperature
then
fell
and
remained
for
some
days
between
and
personally
we
did
not
suffer
at
all
as
we
had
good
fur
clothing
but
with
the
dogs
it
was
another
matter
they
grew
lanker
and
lanker
every
day
and
we
soon
saw
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
stand
it
in
the
long
run
at
our
depot
in
lat
we
agreed
to
turn
back
and
await
the
arrival
of
spring
after
having
stored
our
provisions
we
returned
to
the
hut
excepting
the
loss
of
a
few
dogs
and
one
or
two
frostbitten
heels
all
was
well
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
october
that
the
spring
began
in
earnest
seals
and
birds
were
sighted
the
temperature
remained
steady
between
and
meanwhile
we
had
abandoned
the
original
plan
by
which
all
were
to
go
to
the
south
five
men
were
to
do
this
while
three
others
made
a
trip
to
the
east
to
visit
king
edward
vii
land
this
trip
did
not
form
part
of
our
programme
but
as
the
english
did
not
reach
this
land
last
summer
as
had
been
their
intention
we
agreed
that
it
would
be
best
to
undertake
this
journey
in
addition
on
october
the
southern
party
left
it
consisted
of
five
men
with
four
sledges
and
dogs
and
had
provisions
for
four
months
everything
was
in
excellent
order
and
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
take
it
easy
during
the
first
part
of
the
journey
so
that
we
and
the
dogs
might
not
be
too
fatigued
and
we
therefore
decided
to
make
a
little
halt
on
the
at
the
depot
that
lay
in
lat
however
we
missed
the
mark
owing
to
thick
fog
but
after
two
or
three
march
we
found
the
place
again
when
we
had
rested
here
and
given
the
dogs
as
much
seal
meat
as
they
were
able
to
eat
we
started
again
on
the
the
temperature
remained
steady
between
and
at
first
we
had
made
up
our
minds
not
to
drive
more
than
twelve
to
eighteen
miles
a
day
but
this
proved
to
be
too
little
thanks
to
our
strong
and
willing
animals
at
lat
we
began
to
erect
snow
beacons
about
the
height
of
a
man
to
show
us
the
way
home
on
the
we
reached
the
depot
in
lat
we
halted
for
a
day
and
fed
the
dogs
on
pemmican
on
november
we
reached
the
depot
in
where
for
the
last
time
the
dogs
got
as
much
to
eat
as
they
could
manage
on
the
we
started
southward
again
and
now
made
a
daily
march
of
about
thirty
miles
in
order
to
relieve
the
heavily
laden
sledges
we
formed
a
depot
at
every
parallel
we
reached
the
journey
from
lat
to
was
a
pure
pleasure
trip
on
account
of
the
surface
and
the
temperature
which
were
as
favourable
as
one
could
wish
everything
went
swimmingly
until
the
when
we
sighted
south
victoria
land
and
the
continuation
of
the
mountain
chain
which
shackleton
gives
on
his
map
running
southeast
from
beardmore
glacier
on
the
same
day
we
reached
lat
and
established
here
depot
no
on
the
we
made
the
interesting
discovery
that
the
ross
barrier
ended
in
an
elevation
on
the
formed
between
a
chain
of
mountains
running
from
south
victoria
land
and
another
chain
on
the
opposite
side
which
runs
in
continuation
of
king
edward
vii
land
on
the
we
reached
lat
where
we
established
a
depot
on
the
we
got
to
where
again
we
formed
a
depot
from
our
winter
quarters
at
framheim
we
had
marched
due
south
the
whole
time
on
november
in
lat
we
came
to
a
spot
where
the
land
barrier
intersected
our
route
though
for
the
time
being
this
did
not
cause
us
any
difficulty
the
barrier
here
rises
in
the
form
of
a
wave
to
a
height
of
about
feet
and
its
limit
is
shown
by
a
few
large
fissures
here
we
established
our
main
depot
we
took
supplies
for
sixty
days
on
the
sledges
and
left
behind
enough
provisions
for
thirty
days
the
land
under
which
we
now
lay
and
which
we
were
to
attack
looked
perfectly
impossible
with
peaks
along
the
barrier
which
rose
to
heights
of
from
to
feet
farther
south
we
saw
more
peaks
of
feet
or
higher
next
day
we
began
to
climb
the
first
part
of
the
work
was
easy
as
the
ground
rose
gradually
with
smooth
below
the
our
dogs
working
well
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
get
over
these
slopes
at
the
next
point
we
met
with
some
small
very
steep
glaciers
and
here
we
had
to
harness
twenty
dogs
to
each
sledge
and
take
the
four
sledges
in
two
journeys
some
places
were
so
steep
that
it
was
difficult
to
use
our
ski
several
times
we
were
compelled
by
deep
crevasses
to
turn
back
on
the
first
day
we
climbed
feet
the
next
day
we
crossed
small
glaciers
and
camped
at
a
height
of
feet
on
the
third
day
we
were
obliged
to
descend
the
great
axel
heiberg
glacier
which
separates
the
mountains
of
the
coast
from
those
farther
south
on
the
following
day
the
longest
part
of
our
climbing
began
many
detours
had
to
be
made
to
avoid
broad
fissures
and
open
crevasses
most
of
them
were
filled
up
as
in
all
probability
the
glacier
had
long
ago
ceased
to
move
but
we
had
to
be
very
careful
nevertheless
as
we
could
never
know
the
depth
of
snow
that
covered
them
our
camp
that
night
was
in
very
picturesque
surroundings
at
a
height
of
about
feet
the
glacier
was
here
imprisoned
between
two
mountains
of
feet
which
we
named
after
fridtjof
nansen
and
don
pedro
christophersen
at
the
bottom
of
the
glacier
we
saw
ole
engelstad
great
rising
in
the
air
to
feet
the
glacier
was
much
broken
up
in
this
narrow
defile
enormous
crevasses
seemed
as
if
they
would
stop
our
going
farther
but
fortunately
it
was
not
so
bad
as
it
looked
our
dogs
which
during
the
last
few
days
had
covered
a
distance
of
nearly
miles
put
in
a
very
good
piece
of
work
that
day
as
they
did
miles
on
ground
rising
to
feet
it
was
an
almost
incredible
record
it
only
took
us
four
days
from
the
barrier
to
reach
the
immense
inland
plateau
we
camped
at
a
height
of
feet
here
we
had
to
kill
of
our
brave
dogs
keeping
eighteen
six
for
each
of
our
three
sledges
we
halted
here
for
four
days
on
account
of
bad
weather
on
november
we
were
tired
of
waiting
and
started
again
on
the
we
were
overtaken
by
a
raging
blizzard
in
the
thick
driving
snow
we
could
see
absolutely
nothing
but
we
felt
that
contrary
to
what
we
had
expected
namely
a
further
ascent
we
were
going
rapidly
downhill
the
hypsometer
that
day
showed
a
descent
of
feet
we
continued
our
march
next
day
in
a
strong
wind
and
thick
driving
snow
our
faces
were
badly
frozen
there
was
no
danger
but
we
simply
could
see
nothing
next
day
according
to
our
reckoning
we
reached
lat
the
hypsometer
showed
a
fall
of
feet
the
following
day
passed
in
the
same
way
the
weather
cleared
up
about
noon
and
there
appeared
to
our
astonished
eyes
a
mighty
mountain
range
to
the
east
of
us
and
not
far
away
but
the
vision
only
lasted
a
moment
and
then
disappeared
again
in
the
driving
snow
on
the
the
weather
became
calmer
and
the
sun
shone
a
pleasant
surprise
our
course
lay
over
a
great
glacier
which
ran
in
a
southerly
direction
on
its
eastern
side
was
a
chain
of
mountains
running
to
the
southeast
we
had
no
view
of
its
western
part
as
this
was
lost
in
a
thick
fog
at
the
foot
of
the
devil
glacier
we
established
a
depot
in
lat
calculated
for
six
days
the
hypsometer
showed
feet
above
sea
level
on
november
we
began
to
ascend
the
glacier
the
lower
part
was
much
broken
up
and
dangerous
and
the
thin
bridges
of
snow
over
the
crevasses
often
broke
under
us
from
our
camp
that
evening
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
mountains
to
the
east
mount
helmer
hansen
was
the
most
remarkable
of
them
all
it
was
feet
high
and
covered
by
a
glacier
so
rugged
that
in
all
probability
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
find
foothold
on
it
here
were
also
mounts
oskar
wisting
sverre
hassel
and
olav
bjaaland
grandly
lighted
up
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
the
distance
and
only
visible
from
time
to
time
through
the
driving
mists
we
saw
mount

with
peaks
rising
to
feet
we
could
only
see
those
parts
of
them
that
lay
nearest
to
us
it
took
us
three
days
to
get
over
the
devil
glacier
as
the
weather
was
unusually
misty
on
december
we
left
the
glacier
in
high
spirits
it
was
cut
up
by
innumerable
crevasses
and
holes
we
were
now
at
a
height
of
feet
in
the
mist
and
driving
snow
it
looked
as
if
we
had
a
frozen
lake
before
us
but
it
proved
to
be
a
sloping
plateau
of
ice
full
of
small
blocks
of
ice
our
walk
across
this
frozen
lake
was
not
pleasant
the
ground
under
our
feet
was
evidently
hollow
and
it
sounded
as
if
we
were
walking
on
empty
barrels
first
a
man
fell
through
then
a
couple
of
dogs
but
they
got
up
again
all
right
we
could
not
of
course
use
our
ski
on
this
ice
but
we
got
on
fairly
well
with
the
sledges
we
called
this
place
the
ballroom
this
part
of
our
march
was
the
most
unpleasant
of
the
whole
trip
on
december
we
reached
our
greatest
elevation
according
to
the
hypsometer
and
our
aneroid
barometer
we
were
at
a
height
of
feet
this
was
in
lat
on
december
the
bad
weather
came
to
an
end
the
sun
shone
on
us
once
more
and
we
were
able
to
take
our
observations
again
it
proved
that
the
observations
and
our
reckoning
of
the
distance
covered
gave
exactly
the
same
result
namely
lat
before
us
lay
an
absolutely
flat
plateau
only
broken
by
small
crevices
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
farthest
south
we
pitched
our
camp
in
and
established
our
last
depot
no
from
the
plateau
began
to
descend
evenly
and
very
slowly
we
reached
on
december
on
december
december
december
december
up
to
this
moment
the
observations
and
our
reckoning
had
shown
a
surprising
agreement
we
reckoned
that
we
should
be
at
the
pole
on
december
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
we
had
brilliant
weather
a
light
wind
from
the
with
a
temperature
of
the
sledges
were
going
very
well
the
day
passed
without
any
occurrence
worth
mentioning
and
at
three
in
the
afternoon
we
halted
as
according
to
our
reckoning
we
had
reached
our
goal
we
all
assembled
about
the
norwegian
flag
a
handsome
silken
flag
which
we
took
and
planted
all
together
and
gave
the
immense
plateau
on
which
the
pole
is
situated
the
name
of
king
haakon
vii
plateau
it
was
a
vast
plain
of
the
same
character
in
every
direction
mile
after
mile
during
the
afternoon
we
traversed
the
neighbourhood
of
the
camp
and
on
the
following
day
as
the
weather
was
fine
we
were
occupied
from
six
in
the
morning
till
seven
in
the
evening
in
taking
observations
which
gave
us
as
the
result
in
order
to
take
observations
as
near
the
pole
as
possible
we
went
on
as
near
true
south
as
we
could
for
the
remaining
kilometres
on
december
we
pitched
our
camp
in
brilliant
sunshine
with
the
best
conditions
for
taking
observations
four
of
us
took
observations
every
hour
of
the
day
in
all
the
results
of
these
will
be
submitted
to
the
examination
of
experts
we
have
thus
taken
observations
as
near
to
the
pole
as
was
humanly
possible
with
the
instruments
at
our
disposal
we
had
a
sextant
and
artificial
horizon
calculated
for
a
radius
of
kilometres
on
december
we
were
ready
to
go
we
raised
on
the
spot
a
little
circular
tent
and
planted
above
it
the
norwegian
flag
and
the
pennant
the
norwegian
camp
at
the
south
pole
was
given
the
name
of
polheim
the
distance
from
our
winter
quarters
to
the
pole
was
about
english
miles
so
that
we
had
covered
on
an
average
miles
a
day
we
began
the
return
journey
on
december
the
weather
was
unusually
favourable
and
this
made
our
return
considerably
easier
than
the
march
to
the
pole
we
arrived
at
framheim
our
winter
quarters
in
january
with
two
sledges
and
eleven
dogs
all
well
on
the
homeward
journey
we
covered
an
average
of
miles
a
day
the
lowest
temperature
we
observed
on
this
trip
was
and
the
highest
the
principal
result
besides
the
attainment
of
the
pole
is
the
determination
of
the
extent
and
character
of
the
ross
barrier
next
to
this
the
discovery
of
a
connection
between
south
victoria
land
and
probably
king
edward
vii
land
through
their
continuation
in
huge
which
run
to
the
and
were
seen
as
far
south
as
lat
but
which
in
all
probability
are
continued
right
across
the
antarctic
continent
we
gave
the
name
of
queen
mountains
to
the
whole
range
of
these
newly
discovered
mountains
about
miles
in
length
the
expedition
to
king
edward
vii
land
under
lieutenant
prestrud
has
achieved
excellent
results
scott
discovery
was
confirmed
and
the
examination
of
the
bay
of
whales
and
the
ice
barrier
which
the
party
carried
out
is
of
great
interest
good
geological
collections
have
been
obtained
from
king
edward
vii
land
and
south
victoria
land
the
fram
arrived
at
the
bay
of
whales
on
january
having
been
delayed
in
the
roaring
forties
by
easterly
winds
on
january
the
japanese
expedition
arrived
at
the
bay
of
whales
and
landed
on
the
barrier
near
our
winter
quarters
we
left
the
bay
of
whales
on
january
we
had
a
long
voyage
on
account
of
contrary
wind
we
are
all
in
the
best
of
health
roald
amundsen
hobart
march
introduction
when
the
explorer
comes
home
victorious
everyone
goes
out
to
cheer
him
we
are
all
proud
of
his
achievement
proud
on
behalf
of
the
nation
and
of
humanity
we
think
it
is
a
new
feather
in
our
cap
and
one
we
have
come
by
cheaply
how
many
of
those
who
join
in
the
cheering
were
there
when
the
expedition
was
fitting
out
when
it
was
short
of
bare
necessities
when
support
and
assistance
were
most
urgently
wanted
was
there
then
any
race
to
be
first
at
such
a
time
the
leader
has
usually
found
himself
almost
alone
too
often
he
has
had
to
confess
that
his
greatest
difficulties
were
those
he
had
to
overcome
at
home
before
he
could
set
sail
so
it
was
with
columbus
and
so
it
has
been
with
many
since
his
time
so
it
was
too
with
roald
amundsen
not
only
the
first
time
when
he
sailed
in
the
gjoa
with
the
double
object
of
discovering
the
magnetic
north
pole
and
of
making
the
passage
but
this
time
again
when
in
he
left
the
fjord
on
his
great
expedition
in
the
fram
to
drift
right
across
the
north
polar
sea
what
anxieties
that
man
has
gone
through
which
might
have
been
spared
him
if
there
had
been
more
appreciation
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
it
in
their
power
to
make
things
easier
and
amundsen
had
then
shown
what
stuff
he
was
made
of
both
the
great
objects
of
the
gjoa
expedition
were
achieved
he
has
always
reached
the
goal
he
has
aimed
at
this
man
who
sailed
his
little
yacht
over
the
whole
arctic
ocean
round
the
north
of
america
on
the
course
that
had
been
sought
in
vain
for
four
hundred
years
if
he
staked
his
life
and
abilities
would
it
not
have
been
natural
if
we
had
been
proud
of
having
such
a
man
to
support
but
was
it
so
for
a
long
time
he
struggled
to
complete
his
equipment
money
was
still
lacking
and
little
interest
was
shown
in
him
and
his
work
outside
the
few
who
have
always
helped
so
far
as
was
in
their
power
he
himself
gave
everything
he
possessed
in
the
world
but
this
time
as
last
he
nevertheless
had
to
put
to
sea
loaded
with
anxieties
and
debts
and
as
before
he
sailed
out
quietly
on
a
summer
night
autumn
was
drawing
on
one
day
there
came
a
letter
from
him
in
order
to
raise
the
money
he
could
not
get
at
home
for
his
north
polar
expedition
he
was
going
to
the
south
pole
first
people
stood
still
did
not
know
what
to
say
this
was
an
thing
to
make
for
the
north
pole
by
way
of
the
south
pole
to
make
such
an
immense
and
entirely
new
addition
to
his
plans
without
asking
leave
some
thought
it
grand
more
thought
it
doubtful
but
there
were
many
who
cried
out
that
it
was
inadmissible
disloyal
nay
there
were
some
who
wanted
to
have
him
stopped
but
nothing
of
this
reached
him
he
had
steered
his
course
as
he
himself
had
set
it
without
looking
back
then
by
degrees
it
was
forgotten
and
everyone
went
on
with
his
own
affairs
the
mists
were
upon
us
day
after
day
week
after
week
the
mists
that
are
kind
to
little
men
and
swallow
up
all
that
is
great
and
towers
above
them
suddenly
a
bright
spring
day
cuts
through
the
bank
of
fog
there
is
a
new
message
people
stop
again
and
look
up
high
above
them
shines
a
deed
a
man
a
wave
of
joy
runs
through
the
souls
of
men
their
eyes
are
bright
as
the
flags
that
wave
about
them
why
on
account
of
the
great
geographical
discoveries
the
important
scientific
results
oh
no
that
will
come
later
for
the
few
specialists
this
is
something
all
can
understand
a
victory
of
human
mind
and
human
strength
over
the
dominion
and
powers
of
nature
a
deed
that
lifts
us
above
the
grey
monotony
of
daily
life
a
view
over
shining
plains
with
lofty
mountains
against
the
cold
blue
sky
and
lands
covered
by
of
inconceivable
extent
a
vision
of
glacial
times
the
triumph
of
the
living
over
the
stiffened
realm
of
death
there
is
a
ring
of
steeled
purposeful
human
will
through
icy
frosts
snowstorms
and
death
for
the
victory
is
not
due
to
the
great
inventions
of
the
present
day
and
the
many
new
appliances
of
every
kind
the
means
used
are
of
immense
antiquity
the
same
as
were
known
to
the
nomad
thousands
of
years
ago
when
he
pushed
forward
across
the
plains
of
siberia
and
northern
europe
but
everything
great
and
small
was
thoroughly
thought
out
and
the
plan
was
splendidly
executed
it
is
the
man
that
matters
here
as
everywhere
like
everything
great
it
all
looks
so
plain
and
simple
of
course
that
is
just
as
it
had
to
be
we
think
apart
from
the
discoveries
and
experiences
of
earlier
explorers
which
of
course
were
a
necessary
condition
of
success
both
the
plan
and
its
execution
are
the
ripe
fruit
of
norwegian
life
and
experience
in
ancient
and
modern
times
the
norwegians
daily
winter
life
in
snow
and
frost
our
peasants
constant
use
of
ski
and
in
forest
and
mountain
our
sailors
yearly
whaling
and
sealing
life
in
the
polar
sea
our
explorers
journeys
in
the
arctic
regions
it
was
all
this
with
the
dog
as
a
draught
animal
borrowed
from
the
primitive
races
that
formed
the
foundation
of
the
plan
and
rendered
its
execution
possible
when
the
man
appeared
therefore
when
the
man
is
there
it
carries
him
through
all
difficulties
as
if
they
did
not
exist
every
one
of
them
has
been
foreseen
and
encountered
in
advance
let
no
one
come
and
prate
about
luck
and
chance
amundsen
luck
is
that
of
the
strong
man
who
looks
ahead
how
like
him
and
the
whole
expedition
is
his
telegram
home
as
simple
and
straightforward
as
if
it
concerned
a
holiday
tour
in
the
mountains
it
speaks
of
what
is
achieved
not
of
their
hardships
every
word
a
manly
one
that
is
the
mark
of
the
right
man
quiet
and
strong
it
is
still
too
early
to
measure
the
extent
of
the
new
discoveries
but
the
cablegram
has
already
dispersed
the
mists
so
far
that
the
outlines
are
beginning
to
shape
themselves
that
fairyland
of
ice
so
different
from
all
other
lands
is
gradually
rising
out
of
the
clouds
in
this
wonderful
world
of
ice
amundsen
has
found
his
own
way
from
first
to
last
he
and
his
companions
have
traversed
entirely
unknown
regions
on
their
ski
and
there
are
not
many
expeditions
in
history
that
have
brought
under
the
foot
of
man
so
long
a
range
of
country
hitherto
unseen
by
human
eye
people
thought
it
a
matter
of
course
that
he
would
make
for
beardmore
glacier
which
shackleton
had
discovered
and
by
that
route
come
out
on
to
the
high
snow
plateau
near
the
pole
since
there
he
would
be
sure
of
getting
forward
we
who
knew
amundsen
thought
it
would
be
more
like
him
to
avoid
a
place
for
the
very
reason
that
it
had
been
trodden
by
others
happily
we
were
right
not
at
any
point
does
his
route
touch
that
of
the
englishmen
except
by
the
pole
itself
this
is
a
great
gain
to
research
when
in
a
year
time
we
have
captain
scott
back
safe
and
sound
with
all
his
discoveries
and
observations
on
the
other
route
amundsen
results
will
greatly
increase
in
value
since
the
conditions
will
then
be
illuminated
from
two
sides
the
simultaneous
advance
towards
the
pole
from
two
separate
points
was
precisely
the
most
fortunate
thing
that
could
happen
for
science
the
region
investigated
becomes
so
much
greater
the
discoveries
so
many
more
and
the
importance
of
the
observations
is
more
than
doubled
often
multiplied
many
times
take
for
instance
the
meteorological
conditions
a
single
series
of
observations
from
one
spot
no
doubt
has
its
value
but
if
we
get
a
simultaneous
series
from
another
spot
in
the
same
region
the
value
of
both
becomes
very
much
greater
because
we
then
have
an
opportunity
of
understanding
the
movements
of
the
atmosphere
and
so
with
other
investigations
scott
expedition
will
certainly
bring
back
rich
and
important
results
in
many
departments
but
the
value
of
his
observations
will
also
be
enhanced
when
placed
side
by
side
with
amundsen
an
important
addition
to
amundsen
expedition
to
the
pole
is
the
sledge
journey
of
lieutenant
prestrud
and
his
two
companions
eastward
to
the
unknown
king
edward
vii
land
which
scott
discovered
in
it
looks
rather
as
if
this
land
was
connected
with
the
masses
of
land
and
immense
that
amundsen
found
near
the
pole
we
see
new
problems
looming
up
but
it
was
not
only
these
journeys
over
and
that
were
carried
out
in
masterly
fashion
our
gratitude
is
also
due
to
captain
nilsen
and
his
men
they
brought
the
fram
backwards
and
forwards
twice
each
way
through
those
southern
waters
that
many
experts
even
held
to
be
so
dangerous
that
the
fram
would
not
be
able
to
come
through
them
and
on
both
trips
this
was
done
with
the
speed
and
punctuality
of
a
ship
on
her
regular
route
the
fram
builder
the
excellent
colin
archer
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
way
in
which
his
child
has
performed
her
latest
task
this
vessel
that
has
been
farthest
north
and
farthest
south
on
our
globe
but
captain
nilsen
and
the
crew
of
the
fram
have
done
more
than
this
they
have
carried
out
a
work
of
research
which
in
scientific
value
may
be
compared
with
what
their
comrades
have
accomplished
in
the
unknown
world
of
ice
although
most
people
will
not
be
able
to
recognize
this
while
amundsen
and
his
companions
were
passing
the
winter
in
the
south
captain
nilsen
in
the
fram
investigated
the
ocean
between
south
america
and
africa
at
no
fewer
than
sixty
stations
they
took
a
number
of
temperatures
samples
of
water
and
specimens
of
the
plankton
in
this
region
to
a
depth
of
fathoms
and
more
they
thus
made
the
first
two
sections
that
have
ever
been
taken
of
the
south
atlantic
and
added
new
regions
of
the
unknown
ocean
depths
to
human
knowledge
the
fram
sections
are
the
longest
and
most
complete
that
are
known
in
any
part
of
the
ocean
would
it
be
unreasonable
if
those
who
have
endured
and
achieved
so
much
had
now
come
home
to
rest
but
amundsen
points
onward
so
much
for
that
now
for
the
real
object
next
year
his
course
will
be
through
behring
strait
into
the
ice
and
frost
and
darkness
of
the
north
to
drift
right
across
the
north
polar
sea
five
years
at
least
it
seems
almost
superhuman
but
he
is
the
man
for
that
too
fram
is
his
ship
forward
is
his
motto
and
he
will
come
through
he
will
carry
out
his
main
expedition
the
one
that
is
now
before
him
as
surely
and
steadily
as
that
he
has
just
come
from
but
while
we
are
waiting
let
us
rejoice
over
what
has
already
been
achieved
let
us
follow
the
narrow
that
the
little
black
dots
of
dogs
and
men
have
drawn
across
the
endless
white
surface
down
there
in
the
south
like
a
railroad
of
exploration
into
the
heart
of
the
unknown
the
wind
in
its
everlasting
flight
sweeps
over
these
tracks
in
the
desert
of
snow
soon
all
will
be
blotted
out
but
the
rails
of
science
are
laid
our
knowledge
is
richer
than
before
and
the
light
of
the
achievement
shines
for
all
time

i
am
sitting
in
the

of

surrounded
by
the
most
wonderful
vegetation
enjoying
the
most
magnificent
fruits
and
writing
the
history
of
the
south
pole
what
an
infinite
distance
seems
to
separate
that
region
from
these
surroundings
and
yet
it
is
only
four
months
since
my
gallant
comrades
and
i
reached
the
coveted
spot
i
write
the
history
of
the
south
pole
if
anyone
had
hinted
a
word
of
anything
of
the
sort
four
or
five
years
ago
i
should
have
looked
upon
him
as
incurably
mad
and
yet
the
madman
would
have
been
right
one
circumstance
has
followed
on
the
heels
of
another
and
everything
has
turned
out
so
entirely
different
from
what
i
had
imagined
on
december
five
men
stood
at
the
southern
end
of
our
axis
planted
the
norwegian
flag
there
and
named
the
region
after
the
man
for
whom
they
would
all
gladly
have
offered
their
lives
king
haakon
vii
thus
the
veil
was
torn
aside
for
all
time
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
our
earth
secrets
had
ceased
to
exist
since
i
was
one
of
the
five
who
on
that
december
afternoon
took
part
in
this
unveiling
it
has
fallen
to
my
lot
to
write
the
history
of
the
south
pole
antarctic
exploration
is
very
ancient
even
before
our
conception
of
the
earth
form
had
taken
definite
shape
voyages
to
the
south
began
it
is
true
that
not
many
of
the
explorers
of
those
distant
times
reached
what
we
now
understand
by
the
antarctic
regions
but
still
the
intention
and
the
possibility
were
there
and
justify
the
name
of
antarctic
exploration
the
motive
force
of
these
undertakings
was
as
has
so
often
been
the
case
the
hope
of
gain
rulers
greedy
of
power
saw
in
their
mind
eye
an
increase
of
their
possessions
men
thirsting
for
gold
dreamed
of
an
unsuspected
wealth
of
the
alluring
metal
enthusiastic
missionaries
rejoiced
at
the
thought
of
a
multitude
of
lost
sheep
the
scientifically
trained
world
waited
modestly
in
the
background
but
they
have
all
had
their
share
politics
trade
religion
and
science
the
history
of
antarctic
discovery
may
be
divided
at
the
outset
into
two
categories
in
the
first
of
these
i
would
include
the
numerous
voyagers
who
without
any
definite
idea
of
the
form
or
conditions
of
the
southern
hemisphere
set
their
course
toward
the
south
to
make
what
landfall
they
could
these
need
only
be
mentioned
briefly
before
passing
to
the
second
group
that
of
antarctic
travellers
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
who
with
a
knowledge
of
the
form
of
the
earth
set
out
across
the
ocean
aiming
to
strike
the
antarctic
monster
in
the
heart
if
fortune
favoured
them
we
must
always
remember
with
gratitude
and
admiration
the
first
sailors
who
steered
their
vessels
through
storms
and
mists
and
increased
our
knowledge
of
the
lands
of
ice
in
the
south
people
of
the
present
day
who
are
so
well
supplied
with
information
about
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
earth
and
have
all
our
modern
means
of
communication
at
their
command
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
intrepid
courage
that
is
implied
by
the
voyages
of
these
men
they
shaped
their
course
toward
the
dark
unknown
constantly
exposed
to
being
engulfed
and
destroyed
by
the
vague
mysterious
dangers
that
lay
in
wait
for
them
somewhere
in
that
dim
vastness
the
beginnings
were
small
but
by
degrees
much
was
won
one
stretch
of
country
after
another
was
discovered
and
subjected
to
the
power
of
man
knowledge
of
the
appearance
of
our
globe
became
ever
greater
and
took
more
definite
shape
our
gratitude
to
these
first
discoverers
should
be
profound
and
yet
even
we
hear
people
ask
in
surprise
what
is
the
use
of
these
voyages
of
exploration
what
good
do
they
do
us
little
brains
i
always
answer
to
myself
have
only
room
for
thoughts
of
bread
and
butter
the
first
name
on
the
roll
of
discovery
is
that
of
prince
henry
of
portugal
surnamed
the
navigator
who
is
ever
to
be
remembered
as
the
earliest
promoter
of
geographical
research
to
his
efforts
was
due
the
first
crossing
of
the
equator
about
with
bartholomew
diaz
another
great
step
in
advance
was
made
sailing
from
lisbon
in
he
reached
algoa
bay
and
without
doubt
passed
the
fortieth
parallel
on
his
southward
voyage
vasco
da
gama
voyage
of
is
too
well
known
to
need
description
after
him
came
men
like
cabral
and
vespucci
who
increased
our
knowledge
and
de
gonneville
who
added
to
the
romance
of
exploration
we
then
meet
with
the
greatest
of
the
older
explorers
ferdinand
magellan
a
portuguese
by
birth
though
sailing
in
the
service
of
spain
setting
out
in
he
discovered
the
connection
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
in
the
strait
that
bears
his
name
no
one
before
him
had
penetrated
so
far
south
to
about
lat
one
of
his
ships
the
victoria
accomplished
the
first
circumnavigation
of
the
world
and
thus
established
in
the
popular
mind
the
fact
that
the
earth
was
really
round
from
that
time
the
idea
of
the
antarctic
regions
assumed
definite
shape
there
must
be
something
in
the
south
whether
land
or
water
the
future
was
to
determine
in
we
come
to
the
renowned
english
seaman
sir
francis
drake
though
he
was
accounted
a
buccaneer
we
owe
him
honour
for
the
geographical
discoveries
he
made
he
rounded
cape
horn
and
proved
that
tierra
del
fuego
was
a
great
group
of
islands
and
not
part
of
an
antarctic
continent
as
many
had
thought
the
dutchman
dirk
gerritsz
who
took
part
in
a
plundering
expedition
to
india
in
by
way
of
the
straits
of
magellan
is
said
to
have
been
blown
out
of
his
course
after
passing
the
straits
and
to
have
found
himself
in
lat
under
high
land
covered
with
snow
this
has
been
assumed
to
be
the
south
shetland
islands
but
the
account
of
the
voyage
is
open
to
doubt
in
the
seventeenth
century
we
have
the
discoveries
of
tasman
and
towards
its
close
english
adventurers
reported
having
reached
high
latitudes
in
the
south
atlantic
the
english
astronomer
royal
halley
undertook
a
scientific
voyage
to
the
south
in
for
the
purpose
of
making
magnetic
observations
and
met
with
ice
in
from
which
latitude
he
returned
to
the
north
the
frenchman
bouvet
was
the
first
to
follow
the
southern
for
any
considerable
distance
and
to
bring
reports
of
the
immense
antarctic
icebergs
in
the
spanish
leon
came
home
and
reported
high
land
in
lat
to
the
east
of
cape
horn
the
probability
is
that
this
was
what
we
now
know
by
the
name
of
south
georgia
the
frenchman
discovered
in
the
marion
and
crozet
islands
in
the
same
year
joseph
de
another
frenchman
reached
kerguelen
land
this
concludes
the
series
of
expeditions
that
i
have
thought
it
proper
to
class
in
the
first
group
antarctica
the
sixth
continent
itself
still
lay
unseen
and
untrodden
but
human
courage
and
intelligence
were
now
actively
stirred
to
lift
the
veil
and
reveal
the
many
secrets
that
were
concealed
within
the
antarctic
circle
captain
james
cook
one
of
the
boldest
and
most
capable
seamen
the
world
has
known
opens
the
series
of
antarctic
expeditions
properly
so
called
the
british
admiralty
sent
him
out
with
orders
to
discover
the
great
southern
continent
or
prove
that
it
did
not
exist
the
expedition
consisting
of
two
ships
the
resolution
and
the
adventure
left
plymouth
on
july
after
a
short
stay
at
madeira
it
reached
cape
town
on
october
here
cook
received
news
of
the
discovery
of
kerguelen
and
of
the
marion
and
crozet
islands
in
the
course
of
his
voyage
to
the
south
cook
passed
miles
to
the
south
of
the
land
reported
by
bouvet
and
thereby
established
the
fact
that
the
land
in
question
if
it
existed
was
not
continuous
with
the
great
southern
continent
on
january
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
for
the
first
time
a
memorable
day
in
the
annals
of
antarctic
exploration
shortly
afterwards
a
solid
pack
was
encountered
and
cook
was
forced
to
return
to
the
north
a
course
was
laid
for
the
newly
discovered
islands
kerguelen
marion
and
the
crozets
and
it
was
proved
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
great
southern
land
in
the
course
of
his
further
voyages
in
antarctic
waters
cook
completed
the
most
southerly
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
and
showed
that
there
was
no
connection
between
any
of
the
lands
or
islands
that
had
been
discovered
and
the
great
mysterious
antarctica
his
highest
latitude
january
was
cook
voyages
had
important
commercial
results
as
his
reports
of
the
enormous
number
of
seals
round
south
georgia
brought
many
sealers
both
english
and
american
to
those
waters
and
these
sealers
in
turn
increased
the
field
of
geographical
discovery
in
the
discovery
of
the
south
shetlands
by
the
englishman
captain
william
smith
is
to
be
recorded
and
this
discovery
led
to
that
of
the
palmer
archipelago
to
the
south
of
them
the
next
scientific
expedition
to
the
antarctic
regions
was
that
despatched
by
the
emperor
alexander
of
russia
under
the
command
of
captain
thaddeus
von
bellingshausen
it
was
composed
of
two
ships
and
sailed
from
cronstadt
on
july
to
this
expedition
belongs
the
honour
of
having
discovered
the
first
land
to
the
south
of
the
antarctic
circle
peter
i
island
and
alexander
i
land
the
next
star
in
the
antarctic
firmament
is
the
british
seaman
james
weddell
he
made
two
voyages
in
a
sealer
of
tons
the
jane
of
leith
in
and
being
accompanied
on
the
second
occasion
by
the
cutter
beaufoy
in
february
weddell
had
the
satisfaction
of
beating
cook
record
by
reaching
a
latitude
of
in
the
sea
now
known
as
weddell
sea
which
in
that
year
was
clear
of
ice
the
english
firm
of
shipowners
enderby
brothers
plays
a
not
unimportant
part
in
antarctic
exploration
the
enderbys
had
carried
on
sealing
in
southern
waters
since
they
were
greatly
interested
not
only
in
the
commercial
but
also
in
the
scientific
results
of
these
voyages
and
chose
their
captains
accordingly
in
the
firm
sent
out
john
biscoe
on
a
sealing
voyage
in
the
antarctic
ocean
with
the
brig
tula
and
the
cutter
lively
the
result
of
this
voyage
was
the
sighting
of
enderby
land
in
lat
long
in
the
following
year
adelaide
biscoe
and
pitt
islands
on
the
west
coast
of
graham
land
were
charted
and
graham
land
itself
was
seen
for
the
first
time
kemp
another
of
enderby
skippers
reported
land
in
lat
and
about
long
in
yet
another
skipper
of
the
same
firm
john
balleny
in
the
schooner
eliza
scott
discovered
the
balleny
islands
we
then
come
to
the
celebrated
french
sailor
admiral
jules
sebastien
dumont
he
left
toulon
in
september
with
a
scientifically
equipped
expedition
in
the
ships
astrolabe
and
zelee
the
intention
was
to
follow
in
weddell
track
and
endeavour
to
carry
the
french
flag
still
nearer
to
the
pole
early
in
louis
philippe
land
and
joinville
island
were
discovered
and
named
two
years
later
we
again
find
vessels
in
antarctic
waters
with
the
object
of
investigating
the
magnetic
conditions
in
the
vicinity
of
the
south
magnetic
pole
land
was
discovered
in
lat
and
long
with
the
exception
of
a
few
bare
islets
the
whole
of
this
land
was
completely
covered
with
snow
it
was
given
the
name
of
adelie
land
and
a
part
of
the
lying
to
the
west
of
it
was
called
clarie
on
the
supposition
that
it
must
envelop
a
line
of
coast
the
american
naval
officer
lieutenant
charles
wilkes
sailed
in
august
with
a
fleet
of
six
vessels
the
expedition
was
sent
out
by
congress
and
carried
twelve
scientific
observers
in
february
the
whole
of
this
imposing
antarctic
fleet
was
collected
in
orange
harbour
in
the
south
of
tierra
del
fuego
where
the
work
was
divided
among
the
various
vessels
as
to
the
results
of
this
expedition
it
is
difficult
to
express
an
opinion
certain
it
is
that
wilkes
land
has
subsequently
been
sailed
over
in
many
places
by
several
expeditions
of
what
may
have
been
the
cause
of
this
inaccurate
cartography
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
opinion
it
appears
however
from
the
account
of
the
whole
voyage
that
the
undertaking
was
seriously
conducted
then
the
bright
star
appears
the
man
whose
name
will
ever
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
most
intrepid
polar
explorers
and
one
of
the
most
capable
seamen
the
world
has
produced
admiral
sir
james
clark
ross
the
results
of
his
expedition
are
well
known
ross
himself
commanded
the
erebus
and
commander
francis
crozier
the
terror
the
former
vessel
of
tons
had
been
originally
built
for
throwing
bombs
her
construction
was
therefore
extraordinarily
solid
the
terror
tons
had
been
previously
employed
in
arctic
waters
and
on
this
account
had
been
already
strengthened
in
provisioning
the
ships
every
possible
precaution
was
taken
against
scurvy
with
the
dangers
of
which
ross
was
familiar
from
his
experience
in
arctic
waters
the
vessels
sailed
from
england
in
september
calling
at
many
of
the
atlantic
islands
and
arrived
in
christmas
harbour
kerguelen
land
in
the
following
may
here
they
stayed
two
months
making
magnetic
observations
and
then
proceeded
to
hobart
sir
john
franklin
the
eminent
polar
explorer
was
at
that
time
governor
of
tasmania
and
ross
could
not
have
wished
for
a
better
one
interested
as
franklin
naturally
was
in
the
expedition
he
afforded
it
all
the
help
he
possibly
could
during
his
stay
in
tasmania
ross
received
information
of
what
had
been
accomplished
by
wilkes
and
dumont
in
the
very
region
which
the
admiralty
had
sent
him
to
explore
the
effect
of
this
news
was
that
ross
changed
his
plans
and
decided
to
proceed
along
the
meridian
and
if
possible
to
reach
the
magnetic
pole
from
the
eastward
here
was
another
fortuitous
circumstance
in
the
long
chain
of
events
if
ross
had
not
received
this
intelligence
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
geographical
discoveries
associated
with
his
name
would
have
been
delayed
for
many
years
on
november
sir
john
franklin
went
on
board
the
erebus
to
accompany
his
friend
ross
out
of
port
strange
are
the
ways
of
life
there
stood
franklin
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
which
a
few
years
later
was
to
be
his
deathbed
little
did
he
suspect
as
he
sailed
out
of
hobart
through
storm
bay
the
bay
that
is
now
wreathed
by
the
flourishing
orchards
of
tasmania
that
he
would
meet
his
death
in
a
high
northern
latitude
on
board
the
same
vessel
in
storms
and
frost
but
so
it
was
after
calling
at
the
auckland
islands
and
at
campbell
island
ross
again
steered
for
the
south
and
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
on
new
year
day
the
ships
were
now
faced
by
the
but
to
ross
this
was
not
the
dangerous
enemy
it
had
appeared
to
earlier
explorers
with
their
more
weakly
constructed
vessels
ross
plunged
boldly
into
the
pack
with
his
fortified
ships
and
taking
advantage
of
the
narrow
leads
he
came
out
four
days
later
after
many
severe
buffets
into
the
open
sea
to
the
south
ross
had
reached
the
sea
now
named
after
him
and
the
boldest
voyage
known
in
antarctic
exploration
was
accomplished
few
people
of
the
present
day
are
capable
of
rightly
appreciating
this
heroic
deed
this
brilliant
proof
of
human
courage
and
energy
with
two
ponderous
craft
regular
tubs
according
to
our
ideas
these
men
sailed
right
into
the
heart
of
the
pack
which
all
previous
polar
explorers
had
regarded
as
certain
death
it
is
not
merely
difficult
to
grasp
this
it
is
simply
impossible
to
us
who
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
can
set
the
screw
going
and
wriggle
out
of
the
first
difficulty
we
encounter
these
men
were
heroes
heroes
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
it
was
in
lat
and
long
that
ross
found
the
open
sea
on
the
following
day
the
horizon
was
perfectly
clear
of
ice
what
joy
that
man
must
have
felt
when
he
saw
that
he
had
a
clear
way
to
the
south
the
course
was
set
for
the
magnetic
pole
and
the
hope
of
soon
reaching
it
burned
in
the
hearts
of
all
then
just
as
they
had
accustomed
themselves
to
the
idea
of
open
sea
perhaps
to
the
magnetic
pole
itself
the
reported
high
land
right
ahead
this
was
the
mountainous
coast
of
south
victoria
land
what
a
fairyland
this
must
have
seemed
to
the
first
voyagers
who
approached
it
mighty
with
summits
from
to
feet
high
some
covered
with
snow
and
some
quite
bare
lofty
and
rugged
precipitous
and
wild
it
became
apparent
that
the
magnetic
pole
was
some
miles
distant
far
inland
behind
the
ridges
on
the
morning
of
january
they
came
close
under
a
little
island
and
ross
with
a
few
companions
rowed
ashore
and
took
possession
of
the
country
they
could
not
reach
the
mainland
itself
on
account
of
the
thick
belt
of
ice
that
lay
along
the
coast
the
expedition
continued
to
work
its
way
southward
making
fresh
discoveries
on
january
the
two
lofty
summits
mount
erebus
and
mount
terror
were
sighted
for
the
first
time
the
former
was
seen
to
be
an
active
volcano
from
which
smoke
and
flames
shot
up
into
the
sky
it
must
have
been
a
wonderfully
fine
sight
this
flaming
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
white
frozen
landscape
captain
scott
has
since
given
the
island
on
which
the
mountains
lie
the
name
of
ross
island
after
the
intrepid
navigator
naturally
there
were
great
expectations
on
board
if
they
had
penetrated
so
far
south
there
might
be
no
limit
to
their
further
progress
but
as
had
happened
so
many
times
before
their
hopes
were
disappointed
from
ross
island
as
far
to
the
eastward
as
the
eye
could
see
there
extended
a
lofty
impenetrable
wall
of
ice
to
sail
through
it
was
as
impossible
as
sailing
through
the
cliffs
of
dover
ross
says
in
his
description
all
they
could
do
was
to
try
to
get
round
it
and
then
began
the
first
examination
of
that
part
of
the
great
antarctic
barrier
which
has
since
been
named
the
ross
barrier
the
wall
of
ice
was
followed
to
the
eastward
for
a
distance
of
miles
its
upper
surface
was
seen
to
be
perfectly
flat
the
most
easterly
point
reached
was
long
and
the
highest
latitude
no
opening
having
been
found
the
ships
returned
to
the
west
in
order
to
try
once
more
whether
there
was
any
possibility
of
reaching
the
magnetic
pole
but
this
attempt
soon
had
to
be
abandoned
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
season
and
in
april
ross
returned
to
hobart
his
second
voyage
was
full
of
dangers
and
thrilling
incidents
but
added
little
to
the
tale
of
his
discoveries
on
february
the
ships
came
in
sight
of
the
barrier
and
following
it
to
the
east
found
that
it
turned
here
ross
recorded
an
appearance
of
land
in
the
very
region
in
which
captain
scott
sixty
years
later
discovered
king
edward
vii
land
on
december
ross
set
out
on
his
third
and
last
antarctic
voyage
his
object
this
time
was
to
reach
a
high
latitude
along
the
coast
of
louis
philippe
land
if
possible
or
alternatively
by
following
weddell
track
both
attempts
were
frustrated
by
the
ice
conditions
on
sighting
joinville
land
the
officers
of
the
terror
thought
they
could
see
smoke
from
active
volcanoes
but
ross
and
his
men
did
not
confirm
this
about
fifty
years
later
active
volcanoes
were
actually
discovered
by
the
norwegian
captain
larsen
in
the
jason
a
few
minor
geographical
discoveries
were
made
but
none
of
any
great
importance
this
concluded
ross
attempts
to
reach
the
south
pole
a
magnificent
work
had
been
achieved
and
the
honour
of
having
opened
up
the
way
by
which
at
last
the
pole
was
reached
must
be
ascribed
to
ross
the
pagoda
commanded
by
lieutenant
moore
was
the
next
vessel
to
make
for
the
south
her
chief
object
was
to
make
magnetic
observations
in
high
latitudes
south
of
the
indian
ocean
the
first
ice
was
met
with
in
lat
on
january
on
february
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
in
long
the
most
southerly
latitude
attained
on
this
voyage
was
in
long
this
was
the
last
expedition
to
visit
the
antarctic
regions
in
a
ship
propelled
by
sails
alone
the
next
great
event
in
the
history
of
the
southern
seas
is
the
challenger
expedition
this
was
an
entirely
scientific
expedition
splendidly
equipped
and
conducted
the
achievements
of
this
expedition
are
however
so
well
known
over
the
whole
civilized
world
that
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
dwell
upon
them
less
known
but
no
less
efficient
in
their
work
were
the
whalers
round
the
south
shetlands
and
in
the
regions
to
the
south
of
them
the
days
of
were
now
past
and
vessels
with
auxiliary
steam
appear
on
the
scene
before
passing
on
to
these
i
must
briefly
mention
a
man
who
throughout
his
life
insisted
on
the
necessity
and
utility
of
antarctic
expeditions
professor
georg
von
neumayer
never
has
antarctic
research
had
a
warmer
nobler
and
more
champion
so
long
as
antarctica
endures
the
name
of
neumayer
will
always
be
connected
with
it
the
steam
whaler
gronland
left
hamburg
on
july
in
command
of
captain
eduard
dallmann
bound
for
the
south
shetlands
many
interesting
geographical
discoveries
were
made
on
this
voyage
amongst
other
whalers
may
be
mentioned
the
balaena
the
diana
the
active
and
the
polar
star
of
dundee
in
the
whole
of
this
fleet
stood
to
the
south
to
hunt
for
whales
in
the
vicinity
of
the
south
shetlands
they
each
brought
home
with
them
some
fresh
piece
of
information
on
board
the
balaena
was
william
bruce
this
is
the
first
time
we
meet
with
him
on
his
way
to
the
south
but
it
was
not
to
be
the
last
simultaneously
with
the
scottish
whaling
fleet
the
norwegian
whaling
captain
larsen
appears
in
the
regions
to
the
south
of
the
south
shetlands
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
of
captain
larsen
that
of
all
those
who
have
visited
the
antarctic
regions
in
search
of
whales
he
has
unquestionably
brought
home
the
best
and
most
abundant
scientific
results
to
him
we
owe
the
discovery
of
large
stretches
of
the
east
coast
of
graham
land
king
oscar
ii
land
foyn
land
etc
he
brought
us
news
of
two
active
volcanoes
and
many
groups
of
islands
but
perhaps
the
greatest
interest
attaches
to
the
fossils
he
brought
home
from
seymour
island
the
first
to
be
obtained
from
the
antarctic
regions
in
november
captain
evensen
in
the
hertha
succeeded
in
approaching
nearer
to
alexander
i
land
than
either
bellingshausen
or
biscoe
but
the
search
for
whales
claimed
his
attention
and
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
devote
himself
to
that
before
anything
else
a
grand
opportunity
was
lost
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
captain
evensen
had
been
free
he
would
here
have
had
a
chance
of
achieving
even
better
work
than
he
did
bold
capable
and
enterprising
as
he
is
the
next
whaling
expedition
to
make
its
mark
in
the
south
polar
regions
is
that
of
the
antarctic
under
captain
leonard
kristensen
kristensen
was
an
extraordinarily
capable
man
and
achieved
the
remarkable
record
of
being
the
first
to
set
foot
on
the
sixth
continent
the
great
southern
land
antarctica
this
was
at
cape
adare
victoria
land
in
january
an
phase
of
antarctic
research
is
now
ushered
in
by
the
belgian
expedition
in
the
belgica
under
the
leadership
of
commander
adrien
de
gerlache
hardly
anyone
has
had
a
harder
fight
to
set
his
enterprise
on
foot
than
gerlache
he
was
successful
however
and
on
august
the
belgica
left
antwerp
the
scientific
staff
had
been
chosen
with
great
care
and
gerlache
had
been
able
to
secure
the
services
of
exceedingly
able
men
his
second
in
command
lieutenant
lecointe
a
belgian
possessed
every
qualification
for
his
difficult
position
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
belgica
company
was
as
cosmopolitan
as
it
could
be
belgians
frenchmen
americans
norwegians
swedes
rumanians
poles
etc
and
it
was
the
business
of
the
second
in
command
to
keep
all
these
men
together
and
get
the
best
possible
work
out
of
them
and
lecointe
acquitted
himself
admirably
amiable
and
firm
he
secured
the
respect
of
all
as
a
navigator
and
astronomer
he
was
unsurpassable
and
when
he
afterwards
took
over
the
magnetic
work
he
rendered
great
services
in
this
department
also
lecointe
will
always
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
main
supports
of
this
expedition
lieutenant
emile
danco
another
belgian
was
the
physicist
of
the
expedition
unfortunately
this
gifted
young
man
died
at
an
early
stage
of
the
voyage
a
sad
loss
to
the
expedition
the
magnetic
observations
were
then
taken
over
by
lecointe
the
biologist
was
the
rumanian
emile
racovitza
the
immense
mass
of
material
racovitza
brought
home
speaks
better
than
i
can
for
his
ability
besides
a
keen
interest
in
his
work
he
possessed
qualities
which
made
him
the
most
agreeable
and
interesting
of
companions
henryk
arctowski
and
antoine
dobrowolski
were
both
poles
their
share
of
the
work
was
the
sky
and
the
sea
they
carried
out
oceanographical
and
meteorological
observations
henry
arctowski
was
also
the
geologist
of
the
expedition
an
man
it
was
a
strenuous
task
he
had
that
of
constantly
watching
wind
and
weather
conscientious
as
he
was
he
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
adding
to
the
scientific
results
of
the
voyage
frederick
cook
of
brooklyn
was
surgeon
to
the
expedition
beloved
and
respected
by
all
as
a
medical
man
his
calm
and
convincing
presence
had
an
excellent
effect
as
things
turned
out
the
greatest
responsibility
fell
upon
cook
but
he
mastered
the
situation
in
a
wonderful
way
through
his
practical
qualities
he
finally
became
indispensable
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
belgian
antarctic
expedition
owes
a
great
debt
to
cook
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
to
penetrate
to
the
south
magnetic
pole
but
this
had
to
be
abandoned
at
an
early
stage
for
want
of
time
a
somewhat
long
stay
in
the
interesting
channels
of
tierra
del
fuego
delayed
their
departure
till
january
on
that
date
the
belgica
left
staten
island
and
stood
to
the
south
an
interesting
series
of
soundings
was
made
between
cape
horn
and
the
south
shetlands
as
these
waters
had
not
previously
been
investigated
these
soundings
were
of
course
of
great
importance
the
principal
work
of
the
expedition
from
a
geographical
point
of
view
was
carried
out
on
the
north
coast
of
graham
land
a
large
channel
running
to
the
was
discovered
dividing
a
part
of
palmer
land
from
the
mainland
danco
land
the
strait
was
afterwards
named
by
the
belgian
authorities
gerlache
strait
three
weeks
were
spent
in
charting
it
and
making
scientific
observations
an
excellent
collection
of
material
was
made
this
work
was
completed
by
february
and
the
belgica
left
gerlache
strait
southward
along
the
coast
of
graham
land
at
a
date
when
all
previous
expeditions
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
turn
their
faces
homeward
on
the
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
on
a
course
next
day
they
sighted
alexander
land
but
could
not
approach
nearer
to
it
than
twenty
miles
on
account
of
impenetrable
on
february
they
had
reached
lat
and
long
then
a
breeze
from
the
north
sprang
up
and
opened
large
channels
in
the
ice
leading
southward
they
turned
to
the
south
and
plunged
at
haphazard
into
the
antarctic
floes
on
march
they
reached
lat
where
all
further
progress
was
hopeless
an
attempt
to
get
out
again
was
in
vain
they
were
caught
in
the
trap
they
then
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
many
have
been
disposed
to
blame
gerlache
for
having
gone
into
the
ice
badly
equipped
as
he
was
at
a
time
of
year
when
he
ought
rather
to
have
been
making
his
way
out
and
they
may
be
right
but
let
us
look
at
the
question
from
the
other
side
as
well
after
years
of
effort
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
the
expedition
away
gerlache
knew
for
a
certainty
that
unless
he
returned
with
results
that
would
please
the
public
he
might
just
as
well
never
return
at
all
then
the
thickly
packed
ice
opened
and
long
channels
appeared
leading
as
far
southward
as
the
eye
could
reach
who
could
tell
perhaps
they
led
to
the
pole
itself
there
was
little
to
lose
much
to
gain
he
decided
to
risk
it
of
course
it
was
not
right
but
we
can
easily
understand
it
the
belgica
now
had
thirteen
long
months
before
her
preparations
were
commenced
at
once
for
the
winter
as
many
seals
and
penguins
as
could
be
found
were
shot
and
placed
in
store
the
scientific
staff
was
constantly
active
and
brilliant
oceanographical
meteorological
and
magnetic
work
was
accomplished
on
may
the
sun
disappeared
not
to
be
seen
again
for
seventy
days
the
first
antarctic
night
had
begun
what
would
it
bring
the
belgica
was
not
fitted
for
wintering
in
the
ice
for
one
thing
personal
equipment
was
insufficient
they
had
to
do
the
best
they
could
by
making
clothes
out
of
blankets
and
the
most
extraordinary
devices
were
contrived
in
the
course
of
the
winter
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
on
june
danco
died
of
on
the
same
day
they
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
squeezed
in
the
ice
fortunately
the
enormous
block
of
ice
passed
under
the
vessel
and
lifted
her
up
without
doing
her
any
damage
otherwise
the
first
part
of
the
winter
passed
off
well
afterwards
sickness
appeared
and
threatened
the
most
serious
danger
to
the
expedition
scurvy
and
insanity
one
of
them
by
itself
would
have
been
bad
enough
scurvy
especially
increased
and
did
such
havoc
that
finally
there
was
not
a
single
man
who
escaped
being
attacked
by
this
fearful
disease
cook
behaviour
at
this
time
won
the
respect
and
devotion
of
all
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
cook
was
the
most
popular
man
of
the
expedition
and
he
deserved
it
from
morning
to
night
he
was
occupied
with
his
many
patients
and
when
the
sun
returned
it
happened
not
infrequently
that
after
a
strenuous
day
work
the
doctor
sacrificed
his
night
sleep
to
go
hunting
seals
and
penguins
in
order
to
provide
the
fresh
meat
that
was
so
greatly
needed
by
all
on
july
the
sun
returned
it
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
that
it
shone
upon
the
antarctic
winter
had
set
its
mark
upon
all
and
green
wasted
faces
stared
at
the
returning
light
time
went
on
and
the
summer
arrived
they
waited
day
by
day
to
see
a
change
in
the
ice
but
no
the
ice
they
had
entered
so
was
not
to
be
so
easy
to
get
out
of
again
new
year
day
came
and
went
without
any
change
in
the
ice
the
situation
now
began
to
be
seriously
threatening
another
winter
in
the
ice
would
mean
death
and
destruction
on
a
large
scale
disease
and
insufficient
nourishment
would
soon
make
an
end
of
most
of
the
ship
company
again
cook
came
to
the
aid
of
the
expedition
in
conjunction
with
racovitza
he
had
thought
out
a
very
ingenious
way
of
sawing
a
channel
and
thus
reaching
the
nearest
lead
the
proposal
was
submitted
to
the
leader
of
the
expedition
and
accepted
by
him
both
the
plan
and
the
method
of
carrying
it
out
were
well
considered
after
three
weeks
hard
work
day
and
night
they
at
last
reached
the
lead
cook
was
incontestably
the
leading
spirit
in
this
work
and
gained
such
honour
among
the
members
of
the
expedition
that
i
think
it
just
to
mention
it
upright
honourable
capable
and
conscientious
in
the
extreme
such
is
the
memory
we
retain
of
frederick
cook
from
those
days
little
did
his
comrades
suspect
that
a
few
years
later
he
would
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
humbugs
the
world
has
ever
seen
this
is
a
psychological
enigma
well
worth
studying
to
those
who
care
to
do
so
but
the
belgica
was
not
yet
clear
of
the
ice
after
having
worked
her
way
out
into
the
lead
and
a
little
way
on
she
was
stopped
by
absolutely
close
pack
within
sight
of
the
open
sea
for
a
whole
month
the
expedition
lay
here
reaping
the
same
experiences
as
ross
on
his
second
voyage
with
the
erebus
and
terror
the
immense
seas
raised
the
heavy
ice
high
in
the
air
and
flung
it
against
the
sides
of
the
vessel
that
month
was
a
hell
upon
earth
strangely
enough
the
belgica
escaped
undamaged
and
steamed
into
punta
arenas
in
the
straits
of
magellan
on
march
modern
scientific
antarctic
exploration
had
now
been
initiated
and
de
gerlache
had
won
his
place
for
all
time
in
the
first
rank
of
antarctic
explorers
while
the
belgica
was
trying
her
hardest
to
get
out
of
the
ice
another
vessel
was
making
equally
strenuous
efforts
to
get
in
this
was
the
southern
cross
the
ship
of
the
english
expedition
under
the
leadership
of
carstens
borchgrevink
this
expedition
field
of
work
lay
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pole
in
ross
footsteps
on
february
the
southern
cross
entered
ross
sea
in
lat
and
long
nearly
sixty
years
after
ross
had
left
it
a
party
was
landed
at
cape
adare
where
it
wintered
the
ship
wintered
in
new
zealand
in
january
the
land
party
was
taken
off
and
an
examination
of
the
barrier
was
carried
out
with
the
vessel
this
expedition
succeeded
for
the
first
time
in
ascending
the
barrier
which
from
ross
day
had
been
looked
upon
as
inaccessible
the
barrier
formed
a
little
bight
at
the
spot
where
the
landing
was
made
and
the
ice
sloped
gradually
down
to
the
sea
we
must
acknowledge
that
by
ascending
the
barrier
borchgrevink
opened
a
way
to
the
south
and
threw
aside
the
greatest
obstacle
to
the
expeditions
that
followed
the
southern
cross
returned
to
civilization
in
march
the
valdivia
expedition
under
professor
chun
of
leipzig
must
be
mentioned
though
in
our
day
it
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
an
antarctic
expedition
on
this
voyage
the
position
of
bouvet
island
was
established
once
for
all
as
lat
long
the
ice
was
followed
from
long
to
as
closely
as
the
vessel
could
venture
to
approach
abundance
of
oceanographical
material
was
brought
home
antarctic
exploration
now
shoots
rapidly
ahead
and
the
twentieth
century
opens
with
the
splendidly
equipped
british
and
german
expeditions
in
the
discovery
and
the
gauss
both
national
undertakings
captain
robert
scott
was
given
command
of
the
expedition
and
it
could
not
have
been
placed
in
better
hands
the
second
in
command
was
lieutenant
armitage
who
had
taken
part
in
the
north
polar
expedition
the
other
officers
were
royds
barne
and
shackleton
lieutenant
skelton
was
chief
engineer
and
photographer
to
the
expedition
two
surgeons
were
on
board
koettlitz
a
former
member
of
the
expedition
and
wilson
the
latter
was
also
the
artist
of
the
expedition
bernacchi
was
the
physicist
hodgson
the
biologist
and
ferrar
the
geologist
on
august
the
expedition
left
cowes
and
arrived
at
bay
on
october
on
the
it
sailed
again
for
new
zealand
the
official
plan
was
to
determine
as
accurately
as
possible
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
south
polar
lands
that
might
be
found
and
to
make
a
magnetic
survey
it
was
left
to
the
leader
of
the
expedition
to
decide
whether
it
should
winter
in
the
ice
it
was
arranged
beforehand
that
a
relief
ship
should
visit
and
communicate
with
the
expedition
in
the
following
year
the
first
ice
was
met
with
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
antarctic
circle
on
january
and
a
few
days
later
the
open
ross
sea
was
reached
after
several
landings
had
been
made
at
cape
adare
and
other
points
the
discovery
made
a
very
interesting
examination
of
the
barrier
to
the
eastward
at
this
part
of
the
voyage
king
edward
vii
land
was
discovered
but
the
thick
prevented
the
expedition
from
landing
on
the
way
back
the
ship
entered
the
same
bight
that
borchgrevink
had
visited
in
and
a
balloon
ascent
was
made
on
the
barrier
the
bay
was
called
balloon
inlet
from
here
the
ship
returned
to
mcmurdo
bay
so
named
by
ross
here
the
discovery
wintered
in
a
far
higher
latitude
than
any
previous
expedition
in
the
course
of
the
autumn
it
was
discovered
that
the
land
on
which
the
expedition
had
its
winter
quarters
was
an
island
separated
from
the
mainland
by
mcmurdo
sound
it
was
given
the
name
of
ross
island
sledge
journeys
began
with
the
spring
depots
were
laid
down
and
the
final
march
to
the
south
was
begun
on
november
by
scott
shackleton
and
wilson
they
had
nineteen
dogs
to
begin
with
on
november
they
passed
the
parallel
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
their
progress
was
not
rapid
the
highest
latitude
was
reached
on
december
new
land
was
discovered
a
continuation
of
south
victoria
land
one
summit
after
another
rose
higher
and
higher
to
the
south
the
return
journey
was
a
difficult
one
the
dogs
succumbed
one
after
another
and
the
men
themselves
had
to
draw
the
sledges
it
went
well
enough
so
long
as
all
were
in
health
but
suddenly
shackleton
was
incapacitated
by
scurvy
and
there
were
only
two
left
to
pull
the
sledges
on
february
they
reached
the
ship
again
after
an
absence
of
days
meanwhile
armitage
and
skelton
had
reached
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
high
antarctic
inland
plateau
at
an
altitude
of
feet
above
the
sea
the
relief
ship
morning
had
left
lyttelton
on
december
on
her
way
south
scott
island
was
discovered
and
on
january
the
masts
were
seen
but
mcmurdo
sound
lay
icebound
all
that
year
and
the
morning
returned
home
on
march
the
expedition
passed
a
second
winter
in
the
ice
and
in
the
following
spring
captain
scott
led
a
sledge
journey
to
the
west
on
the
ice
plateau
in
january
the
morning
returned
accompanied
by
the
terra
nova
formerly
a
newfoundland
sealing
vessel
they
brought
orders
from
home
that
the
discovery
was
to
be
abandoned
if
she
could
not
be
got
out
preparations
were
made
for
carrying
out
the
order
but
finally
after
explosives
had
been
used
a
sudden
of
the
ice
set
the
vessel
free
all
the
coal
that
could
be
spared
was
put
on
board
the
discovery
from
the
relief
ships
and
scott
carried
his
researches
further
if
at
that
time
he
had
had
more
coal
it
is
probable
that
this
active
explorer
would
have
accomplished
even
greater
things
than
he
did
ringgold
knoll
and
eld
peak
were
wiped
off
the
map
and
nothing
was
seen
of
cape
hudson
though
the
discovery
passed
well
within
sight
of
its
supposed
position
on
march
scott
anchored
in
ross
harbour
auckland
islands
with
rich
results
the
expedition
returned
home
in
september
meanwhile
the
german
expedition
under
professor
erich
von
drygalski
had
been
doing
excellent
work
in
another
quarter
the
plan
of
the
expedition
was
to
explore
the
antarctic
regions
to
the
south
of
kerguelen
land
after
having
first
built
a
station
on
that
island
and
landed
a
scientific
staff
who
were
to
work
there
while
the
main
expedition
proceeded
into
the
ice
its
ship
the
gauss
had
been
built
at
kiel
with
the
fram
as
a
model
the
gauss
navigator
was
captain
hans
ruser
a
skilful
seaman
of
the
line
drygalski
had
chosen
his
scientific
staff
with
knowledge
and
care
and
it
is
certain
that
he
could
not
have
obtained
better
assistants
the
expedition
left
kiel
on
august
bound
for
cape
town
an
extraordinarily
complete
oceanographical
meteorological
and
magnetic
survey
was
made
during
this
part
of
the
voyage
after
visiting
the
crozet
islands
the
gauss
anchored
in
royal
sound
kerguelen
land
on
december
the
expedition
stayed
here
a
month
and
then
steered
for
the
south
to
explore
the
regions
between
kemp
land
and
knox
land
they
had
already
encountered
a
number
of
bergs
in
lat
on
february
they
made
a
sounding
of
fathoms
near
the
supposed
position
of
wilkes
termination
land
progress
was
very
slow
hereabout
on
account
of
the
thick
floes
suddenly
on
february
they
had
a
sounding
of
fathoms
and
on
the
morning
of
february
land
was
sighted
entirely
covered
with
ice
and
snow
a
violent
storm
took
the
gauss
by
surprise
collected
a
mass
of
icebergs
around
her
and
filled
up
the
intervening
space
with
floes
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
making
any
way
they
had
to
swallow
the
bitter
pill
and
prepare
to
spend
the
winter
where
they
were
observatories
were
built
of
ice
and
sledge
journeys
were
undertaken
as
soon
as
the
surface
permitted
they
reached
land
in
three
and
a
half
days
and
there
discovered
a
bare
mountain
about
feet
high
fifty
miles
from
the
ship
the
land
was
named
kaiser
wilhelm
ii
land
and
the
mountain
the
gaussberg
they
occupied
the
winter
in
observations
of
every
possible
kind
the
weather
was
extremely
stormy
and
severe
but
their
winter
harbour
under
the
lee
of
great
stranded
bergs
proved
to
be
a
good
one
they
were
never
once
exposed
to
unpleasant
surprises
on
february
the
gauss
was
able
to
begin
to
move
again
from
the
time
she
reached
the
open
sea
until
her
arrival
at
cape
town
on
june
scientific
observations
were
continued
high
land
had
been
seen
to
the
eastward
on
the
bearing
of
termination
land
and
an
amount
of
scientific
work
had
been
accomplished
of
which
the
german
nation
may
well
be
proud
few
antarctic
expeditions
have
had
such
a
thoroughly
scientific
equipment
as
that
of
the
gauss
both
as
regards
appliances
and
personnel
the
swedish
antarctic
expedition
under
otto
nordenskjold
left
gothenburg
on
october
in
the
antarctic
commanded
by
captain
larsen
already
mentioned
the
scientific
staff
was
composed
of
nine
specialists
after
calling
at
the
falkland
islands
and
staten
island
a
course
was
made
for
the
south
shetlands
which
came
in
sight
on
january
after
exploring
the
coast
of
louis
philippe
land
the
ship
visited
weddell
sea
in
the
hope
of
getting
southward
along
king
oscar
ii
land
but
the
ice
conditions
were
difficult
and
it
was
impossible
to
reach
the
coast
nordenskjold
and
five
men
were
then
landed
on
snow
hill
island
with
materials
for
an
observatory
and
winter
quarters
and
the
necessary
provisions
the
ship
continued
her
course
northward
to
the
open
sea
the
first
winter
on
snow
hill
island
was
unusually
stormy
and
cold
but
during
the
spring
several
interesting
sledge
journeys
were
made
when
summer
arrived
the
antarctic
did
not
appear
and
the
land
party
were
obliged
to
prepare
for
a
second
winter
in
the
following
spring
october
nordenskjold
made
a
sledge
journey
to
explore
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
haddington
and
a
closer
examination
showed
that
the
mountain
lay
on
an
island
in
attempting
to
work
round
this
island
he
one
day
stumbled
upon
three
figures
doubtfully
human
which
might
at
first
sight
have
been
taken
for
some
of
our
african
brethren
straying
thus
far
to
the
south
it
took
nordenskjold
a
long
time
to
recognize
in
these
beings
gunnar
andersson
lieutenant
duse
and
their
companion
during
the
winter
a
norwegian
sailor
named
grunden
the
way
it
came
about
was
this
the
antarctic
had
made
repeated
attempts
to
reach
the
winter
station
but
the
state
of
the
ice
was
bad
and
they
had
to
give
up
the
idea
of
getting
through
andersson
duse
and
grunden
were
then
landed
in
the
vicinity
to
bring
news
to
the
winter
quarters
as
soon
as
the
ice
permitted
them
to
arrive
there
they
had
been
obliged
to
build
themselves
a
stone
hut
in
which
they
had
passed
the
winter
this
experience
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
one
can
read
of
in
the
history
of
the
polar
regions
badly
equipped
as
they
were
they
had
to
have
recourse
like
robinson
crusoe
to
their
inventive
faculties
the
most
extraordinary
contrivances
were
devised
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
when
spring
came
the
three
men
stepped
out
of
their
hole
well
and
hearty
ready
to
tackle
their
work
this
was
such
a
remarkable
feat
that
everyone
who
has
some
knowledge
of
polar
conditions
must
yield
them
his
admiration
but
there
is
more
to
tell
on
november
when
both
parties
were
united
at
snow
hill
they
were
unexpectedly
joined
by
captain
irizar
of
the
argentine
gunboat
uruguay
and
one
of
his
officers
some
anxiety
had
been
felt
owing
to
the
absence
of
news
of
the
antarctic
and
the
argentine
government
had
sent
the
uruguay
to
the
south
to
search
for
the
expedition
but
what
in
the
world
had
become
of
captain
larsen
and
the
antarctic
this
was
the
question
the
others
asked
themselves
the
same
night
it
sounds
almost
incredible
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
hut
and
in
walked
captain
larsen
with
five
of
his
men
they
brought
the
sad
intelligence
that
the
good
ship
antarctic
was
no
more
the
crew
had
saved
themselves
on
the
nearest
island
while
the
vessel
sank
severely
damaged
by
ice
they
too
had
had
to
build
themselves
a
stone
hut
and
get
through
the
winter
as
best
they
could
they
certainly
did
not
have
an
easy
time
and
i
can
imagine
that
the
responsibility
weighed
heavily
on
him
who
had
to
bear
it
one
man
died
the
others
came
through
it
well
much
of
the
excellent
material
collected
by
the
expedition
was
lost
by
the
sinking
of
the
antarctic
but
a
good
deal
was
brought
home
both
from
a
scientific
and
from
a
popular
point
of
view
this
expedition
may
be
considered
one
of
the
most
interesting
the
south
polar
regions
have
to
show
we
then
come
to
the
scotsman
william
bruce
in
the
scotia
we
have
met
with
bruce
before
first
in
the
balaena
in
and
afterwards
with
andrew
coats
in
spitzbergen
the
latter
voyage
was
a
fortunate
one
for
bruce
as
it
provided
him
with
the
means
of
fitting
out
his
expedition
in
the
scotia
to
antarctic
waters
the
vessel
left
the
clyde
on
november
under
the
command
of
captain
thomas
robertson
of
dundee
bruce
had
secured
the
assistance
of
mossman
rudmose
brown
and
pirie
for
the
scientific
work
in
the
following
february
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
and
on
the
of
that
month
the
ship
was
brought
to
a
standstill
in
lat
the
winter
was
spent
at
laurie
island
one
of
the
south
orkneys
returning
to
the
south
the
scotia
reached
in
march
lat
long
where
the
sea
rapidly
shoaled
to
fathoms
further
progress
was
impossible
owing
to
ice
hilly
country
was
sighted
beyond
the
barrier
and
named
coats
land
after
bruce
chief
supporters
in
the
foremost
rank
of
the
antarctic
explorers
of
our
time
stands
the
french
savant
and
yachtsman
jean
charcot
in
the
course
of
his
two
expeditions
of
and
he
succeeded
in
opening
up
a
large
extent
of
the
unknown
continent
we
owe
to
him
a
closer
acquaintance
with
alexander
i
land
and
the
discovery
of
loubet
fallieres
and
charcot
lands
is
also
his
work
his
expeditions
were
splendidly
equipped
and
the
scientific
results
were
extraordinarily
rich
the
point
that
compels
our
special
admiration
in
charcot
voyages
is
that
he
chose
one
of
the
most
difficult
fields
of
the
antarctic
zone
to
work
in
the
ice
conditions
here
are
extremely
unfavourable
and
navigation
in
the
highest
degree
risky
a
coast
full
of
submerged
reefs
and
a
sea
strewn
with
icebergs
was
what
the
frenchmen
had
to
contend
with
the
exploration
of
such
regions
demands
capable
men
and
stout
vessels
sir
ernest
shackleton
the
name
has
a
brisk
sound
at
its
mere
mention
we
see
before
us
a
man
of
indomitable
will
and
boundless
courage
he
has
shown
us
what
the
will
and
energy
of
a
single
man
can
perform
he
gained
his
first
experience
of
antarctic
exploration
as
a
member
of
the
british
expedition
in
the
discovery
under
captain
scott
it
was
a
good
school
scott
wilson
and
shackleton
formed
the
southern
party
with
the
highest
latitude
as
their
goal
they
reached
a
great
record
at
that
time
being
attacked
by
scurvy
shackleton
had
to
go
home
at
the
first
opportunity
shortly
after
his
return
shackleton
began
to
make
active
preparations
few
people
had
any
faith
in
shackleton
was
it
he
who
was
sent
home
from
the
discovery
after
the
first
year
what
does
he
want
to
go
out
for
again
he
has
shown
well
enough
that
he
ca
stand
the
work
shackleton
had
a
hard
struggle
to
find
the
necessary
funds
he
left
england
unheeded
and
loaded
with
debts
in
august
on
board
the
nimrod
bound
for
the
south
pole
with
surprising
frankness
he
declared
his
intention
of
trying
to
reach
the
pole
itself
so
far
as
i
know
he
was
the
first
who
ventured
to
say
straight
out
that
the
pole
was
his
object
this
hearty
frankness
was
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
and
made
me
look
more
closely
at
the
man
later
on
i
followed
his
steps
with
the
greatest
interest
the
expedition
unnoticed
when
it
left
england
was
soon
forgotten
at
most
people
connected
the
name
of
shackleton
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
and
the
months
went
by
then
suddenly
came
a
piece
of
news
that
made
a
great
stir
it
was
in
the
latter
half
of
march
the
telegraphic
instruments
were
busy
all
over
the
world
letter
by
letter
word
by
word
they
ticked
out
the
message
until
it
could
be
clearly
read
that
one
of
the
most
wonderful
achievements
of
polar
exploration
had
been
accomplished
everyone
was
spellbound
was
it
possible
could
it
be
true
shackleton
lieutenant
had
fought
his
way
to
lat
seldom
has
a
man
enjoyed
a
greater
triumph
seldom
has
a
man
deserved
it
better
as
the
details
of
sir
ernest
shackleton
expedition
will
be
fresh
in
the
minds
of
english
readers
it
is
unnecessary
to
recapitulate
them
here
a
few
points
may
however
be
noted
for
comparison
with
the
fram
expedition
the
plan
was
to
leave
new
zealand
at
the
beginning
of
and
go
into
winter
quarters
on
the
antarctic
continent
with
the
necessary
provisions
and
equipment
while
the
vessel
returned
to
new
zealand
and
came
back
to
take
off
the
land
party
in
the
following
year
the
land
party
that
wintered
in
the
south
was
divided
into
three
one
party
was
to
go
eastward
to
king
edward
vii
land
and
explore
it
the
second
was
to
go
westward
to
the
south
magnetic
pole
and
the
third
southward
toward
the
geographical
pole
in
the
plan
submitted
to
the
royal
geographical
society
shackleton
says
i
do
not
intend
to
sacrifice
the
scientific
utility
of
the
expedition
to
a
mere
journey
but
say
frankly
all
the
same
that
one
of
my
great
efforts
will
be
to
reach
the
southern
geographical
pole
it
was
further
intended
that
the
nimrod
should
explore
wilkes
land
as
draught
animals
shackleton
had
both
ponies
and
dogs
but
chiefly
ponies
the
dogs
were
regarded
more
as
a
reserve
experience
was
that
the
ice
barrier
was
best
suited
for
ponies
they
also
took
a
besides
the
usual
equipment
of
sledges
ski
tents
etc
leaving
lyttelton
on
january
the
nimrod
reached
the
on
the
and
arrived
in
the
open
ross
sea
in
lat
long
the
ross
barrier
was
sighted
on
january
the
original
intention
was
to
follow
this
and
try
to
land
the
shore
party
in
barrier
inlet
which
was
practically
the
beginning
of
king
edward
vii
land
but
it
was
found
that
barrier
inlet
had
disappeared
owing
to
miles
of
the
barrier
having
calved
away
in
its
place
was
a
long
wide
bay
which
shackleton
named
the
bay
of
whales
this
discovery
determined
him
not
to
attempt
to
winter
on
the
barrier
but
on
solid
land
at
this
part
of
the
voyage
the
course
of
the
nimrod
coincided
very
nearly
with
that
of
the
fram
on
her
second
outward
trip
after
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
reach
king
edward
vii
land
shackleton
turned
to
the
west
and
took
up
his
winter
quarters
on
ross
island
in
mcmurdo
sound
the
southern
party
composed
of
shackleton
adams
marshall
and
wild
started
on
october
with
four
sledges
four
ponies
and
provisions
for
days
on
november
scott
farthest
south
was
passed
by
the
time
lat
was
reached
all
the
ponies
were
dead
and
the
men
had
to
draw
the
sledges
themselves
they
were
then
faced
by
the
long
and
difficult
ascent
of
beardmore
glacier
and
it
was
not
until
seventeen
days
later
that
they
came
out
on
the
high
plateau
surrounding
the
pole
at
last
on
january
they
were
compelled
to
return
by
shortness
of
provisions
having
planted
queen
alexandra
flag
in
lat
long
everyone
who
reads
shackleton
diary
must
feel
a
boundless
admiration
for
these
four
heroes
history
can
scarcely
show
a
clearer
proof
of
what
men
can
accomplish
when
they
exert
their
full
strength
of
will
and
body
these
men
have
raised
a
monument
not
only
to
themselves
and
their
achievement
but
also
to
the
honour
of
their
native
land
and
the
whole
of
civilized
humanity
shackleton
exploit
is
the
most
brilliant
incident
in
the
history
of
antarctic
exploration
the
distance
covered
out
and
back
was
geographical
miles
the
time
occupied
was
days
days
out
and
days
back
the
average
daily
march
was
about
miles
meanwhile
the
other
party
composed
of
professor
david
mawson
and
mackay
had
set
off
to
determine
the
position
of
the
south
magnetic
pole
they
had
neither
ponies
nor
dogs
and
had
therefore
to
depend
solely
on
their
own
powers
it
seems
almost
incredible
but
these
men
succeeded
in
working
their
way
on
foot
over
and
cracks
and
crevasses
hard
snow
and
loose
snow
to
the
magnetic
pole
and
making
observations
there
what
was
better
still
they
all
came
back
safe
and
sound
the
total
distance
covered
was
geographical
miles
it
must
have
been
a
proud
day
for
the
two
parties
of
the
expedition
when
they
met
again
on
the
deck
of
the
nimrod
and
could
tell
each
other
of
their
experiences
more
than
any
of
their
predecessors
these
men
had
succeeded
in
raising
the
veil
that
lay
over
antarctica
but
a
little
corner
remained
chapter
ii
plan
and
preparations
the
deity
of
success
is
a
woman
and
she
insists
on
being
won
not
courted
you
got
to
seize
her
and
bear
her
off
instead
of
standing
under
her
window
with
a
mandolin
rex
beach
the
north
pole
is
reached
in
a
flash
the
news
spread
over
the
world
the
goal
of
which
so
many
had
dreamed
for
which
so
many
had
laboured
and
suffered
and
sacrificed
their
lives
was
attained
it
was
in
september
that
the
news
reached
us
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
the
original
plan
of
the
fram
third
voyage
the
exploration
of
the
north
polar
basin
hung
in
the
balance
if
the
expedition
was
to
be
saved
it
was
necessary
to
act
quickly
and
without
hesitation
just
as
rapidly
as
the
message
had
travelled
over
the
cables
i
decided
on
my
change
of
front
to
turn
to
the
and
face
to
the
south
it
was
true
that
i
had
announced
in
my
plan
that
the
fram
third
voyage
would
be
in
every
way
a
scientific
expedition
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
was
also
true
that
many
of
the
contributors
who
had
so
warmly
supported
me
had
done
so
with
the
original
plan
before
them
but
in
view
of
the
altered
circumstances
and
the
small
prospect
i
now
had
of
obtaining
funds
for
my
original
plan
i
considered
it
neither
mean
nor
unfair
to
my
supporters
to
strike
a
blow
that
would
at
once
put
the
whole
enterprise
on
its
feet
retrieve
the
heavy
expenses
that
the
expedition
had
already
incurred
and
save
the
contributions
from
being
wasted
it
was
therefore
with
a
clear
conscience
that
i
decided
to
postpone
my
original
plan
for
a
year
or
two
in
order
to
try
in
the
meantime
to
raise
the
funds
that
were
still
lacking
the
north
pole
the
last
problem
but
one
of
popular
interest
in
polar
exploration
was
solved
if
i
was
now
to
succeed
in
arousing
interest
in
my
undertaking
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
try
to
solve
the
last
great
problem
the
south
pole
i
know
that
i
have
been
reproached
for
not
having
at
once
made
the
extended
plan
public
so
that
not
only
my
supporters
but
the
explorers
who
were
preparing
to
visit
the
same
regions
might
have
knowledge
of
it
i
was
well
aware
that
these
reproaches
would
come
and
had
therefore
carefully
weighed
this
side
of
the
matter
as
regards
the
former
the
contributors
to
my
expedition
my
mind
was
soon
at
rest
they
were
all
men
of
position
and
above
discussing
the
application
of
the
sums
they
had
dedicated
to
the
enterprise
i
knew
that
i
enjoyed
such
confidence
among
these
people
that
they
would
all
judge
the
circumstances
aright
and
know
that
when
the
time
came
their
contributions
would
be
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
given
and
i
have
already
received
countless
proofs
that
i
was
not
mistaken
nor
did
i
feel
any
great
scruples
with
regard
to
the
other
antarctic
expeditions
that
were
being
planned
at
the
time
i
knew
i
should
be
able
to
inform
captain
scott
of
the
extension
of
my
plans
before
he
left
civilization
and
therefore
a
few
months
sooner
or
later
could
be
of
no
great
importance
scott
plan
and
equipment
were
so
widely
different
from
my
own
that
i
regarded
the
telegram
that
i
sent
him
later
with
the
information
that
we
were
bound
for
the
antarctic
regions
rather
as
a
mark
of
courtesy
than
as
a
communication
which
might
cause
him
to
alter
his
programme
in
the
slightest
degree
the
british
expedition
was
designed
entirely
for
scientific
research
the
pole
was
only
a
whereas
in
my
extended
plan
it
was
the
main
object
on
this
little
detour
science
would
have
to
look
after
itself
but
of
course
i
knew
very
well
that
we
could
not
reach
the
pole
by
the
route
i
had
determined
to
take
without
enriching
in
a
considerable
degree
several
branches
of
science
our
preparations
were
entirely
different
and
i
doubt
whether
captain
scott
with
his
great
knowledge
of
antarctic
exploration
would
have
departed
in
any
point
from
the
experience
he
had
gained
and
altered
his
equipment
in
accordance
with
that
which
i
found
it
best
to
employ
for
i
came
far
short
of
scott
both
in
experience
and
means
as
regards
lieutenant
shirase
in
the
kainan
maru
i
understood
it
to
be
his
plan
to
devote
his
whole
attention
to
king
edward
vii
land
after
thus
thoroughly
considering
these
questions
i
came
to
the
conclusions
i
have
stated
and
my
plan
was
irrevocably
fixed
if
at
that
juncture
i
had
made
my
intention
public
it
would
only
have
given
occasion
for
a
lot
of
newspaper
discussion
and
possibly
have
ended
in
the
project
being
stifled
at
its
birth
everything
had
to
be
got
ready
quietly
and
calmly
my
brother
upon
whose
absolute
silence
i
could
blindly
rely
was
the
only
person
i
let
into
the
secret
of
my
change
of
plan
and
he
did
me
many
important
services
during
the
time
when
we
alone
shared
the
knowledge
then
lieutenant
thorvald
nilsen
at
that
time
first
officer
of
the
fram
now
her
commander
returned
home
and
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
inform
him
immediately
of
my
resolve
the
way
in
which
he
received
it
made
me
feel
safe
in
my
choice
of
him
i
saw
that
in
him
i
had
found
not
only
a
capable
and
trustworthy
man
but
a
good
comrade
as
well
and
this
was
a
point
of
the
highest
importance
if
the
relations
between
the
chief
and
the
second
in
command
are
good
much
unpleasantness
and
many
unnecessary
worries
can
be
avoided
besides
which
a
good
understanding
in
this
quarter
gives
an
example
to
the
whole
ship
it
was
a
great
relief
to
me
when
captain
nilsen
came
home
in
january
and
was
able
to
help
which
he
did
with
a
good
will
a
capability
and
a
reliability
that
i
have
no
words
to
commend
the
following
was
the
plan
of
the
fram
southern
voyage
departure
from
norway
at
latest
before
the
middle
of
august
madeira
was
to
be
the
first
and
only
place
of
call
from
there
a
course
was
to
be
made
on
the
best
route
for
a
for
the
fram
can
not
be
regarded
as
anything
else
southward
through
the
atlantic
and
then
to
the
east
passing
to
the
south
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
australia
and
finally
pushing
through
the
pack
and
into
ross
sea
about
new
year
as
a
base
of
operations
i
had
chosen
the
most
southerly
point
we
could
reach
with
the
vessel
the
bay
of
whales
in
the
great
antarctic
barrier
we
hoped
to
arrive
here
about
january
after
having
landed
the
selected
shore
party
about
ten
men
with
materials
for
a
house
equipment
and
provisions
for
two
years
the
fram
was
to
go
out
again
and
up
to
buenos
aires
in
order
to
carry
out
from
there
an
oceanographical
voyage
across
the
atlantic
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
back
in
october
she
was
to
return
to
the
bay
of
whales
and
take
off
the
shore
party
so
much
but
no
more
could
be
settled
beforehand
the
further
progress
of
the
expedition
could
only
be
determined
later
when
the
work
in
the
south
was
finished
my
knowledge
of
the
ross
barrier
was
due
to
descriptions
alone
but
i
had
so
carefully
studied
all
the
literature
that
treats
of
these
regions
that
on
first
encountering
this
mighty
mass
of
ice
i
felt
as
if
i
had
known
it
for
many
years
after
thorough
consideration
i
fixed
upon
the
bay
of
whales
as
a
winter
station
for
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
because
we
could
there
go
farther
south
in
the
ship
than
at
any
other
point
a
whole
degree
farther
south
than
scott
could
hope
to
get
in
mcmurdo
sound
where
he
was
to
have
his
station
and
this
would
be
of
very
great
importance
in
the
subsequent
sledge
journey
toward
the
pole
another
great
advantage
was
that
we
came
right
on
to
our
field
of
work
and
could
see
from
our
hut
door
the
conditions
and
surface
we
should
have
to
deal
with
besides
this
i
was
justified
in
supposing
that
the
surface
southward
from
this
part
of
the
barrier
would
be
considerably
better
and
offer
fewer
difficulties
than
the
ice
along
the
land
in
addition
animal
life
in
the
bay
of
whales
was
according
to
the
descriptions
extraordinarily
rich
and
offered
all
the
fresh
meat
we
required
in
the
form
of
seals
penguins
etc
besides
these
purely
technical
and
material
advantages
which
the
barrier
seemed
to
possess
as
a
winter
station
it
offered
a
specially
favourable
site
for
an
investigation
of
the
meteorological
conditions
since
here
one
would
be
unobstructed
by
land
on
all
sides
it
would
be
possible
to
study
the
character
of
the
barrier
by
daily
observations
on
the
very
spot
better
than
anywhere
else
such
interesting
phenomena
as
the
movement
feeding
and
calving
of
this
immense
mass
of
ice
could
of
course
be
studied
very
fully
at
this
spot
last
but
not
least
there
was
the
enormous
advantage
that
it
was
comparatively
easy
to
reach
in
the
vessel
no
expedition
had
yet
been
prevented
from
coming
in
here
i
knew
that
this
plan
of
wintering
on
the
barrier
itself
would
be
exposed
to
severe
criticism
as
recklessness
foolhardiness
and
so
forth
for
it
was
generally
assumed
that
the
barrier
was
afloat
here
as
in
other
places
indeed
it
was
thought
to
be
so
even
by
those
who
had
themselves
seen
it
shackleton
description
of
the
conditions
at
the
time
of
his
visit
did
not
seem
very
promising
mile
after
mile
had
broken
away
and
he
thanked
god
he
had
not
made
his
camp
there
although
i
have
a
very
great
regard
for
shackleton
his
work
and
his
experience
i
believe
that
in
this
case
his
conclusion
was
too
hasty
fortunately
i
must
add
for
if
when
shackleton
passed
the
bay
of
whales
on
january
and
saw
the
ice
of
the
bay
in
process
of
breaking
up
and
drifting
out
he
had
waited
a
few
hours
or
at
the
most
a
couple
of
days
the
problem
of
the
south
pole
would
probably
have
been
solved
long
before
december
with
his
keen
sight
and
sound
judgment
it
would
not
have
taken
him
long
to
determine
that
the
inner
part
of
the
bay
does
not
consist
of
floating
barrier
but
that
the
barrier
there
rests
upon
a
good
solid
foundation
probably
in
the
form
of
small
islands
skerries
or
shoals
and
from
this
point
he
and
his
able
companions
would
have
disposed
of
the
south
polar
question
once
for
all
but
circumstances
willed
it
otherwise
and
the
veil
was
only
lifted
not
torn
away
i
had
devoted
special
study
to
this
peculiar
formation
in
the
barrier
and
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
inlet
that
exists
in
the
ross
barrier
under
the
name
of
the
bay
of
whales
is
nothing
else
than
the
bight
that
was
observed
by
sir
james
clark
ross
no
doubt
with
great
changes
of
outline
but
still
the
same
for
seventy
years
then
this
formation
with
the
exception
of
the
pieces
that
had
broken
away
had
persisted
in
the
same
place
i
therefore
concluded
that
it
could
be
no
accidental
formation
what
once
in
the
dawn
of
time
arrested
the
mighty
stream
of
ice
at
this
spot
and
formed
a
lasting
bay
in
its
edge
which
with
few
exceptions
runs
in
an
almost
straight
line
was
not
merely
a
passing
whim
of
the
fearful
force
that
came
crashing
on
but
something
even
stronger
than
that
something
that
was
firmer
than
the
hard
ice
namely
the
solid
land
here
in
this
spot
then
the
barrier
piled
itself
up
and
formed
the
bay
we
now
call
the
bay
of
whales
the
observations
we
made
during
our
stay
there
confirm
the
correctness
of
this
theory
i
therefore
had
no
misgivings
in
placing
our
station
on
this
part
of
the
barrier
the
plan
of
the
shore
party
was
as
soon
as
the
hut
was
built
and
provisions
landed
to
carry
supplies
into
the
field
and
lay
down
depots
as
far
to
the
south
as
possible
i
hoped
to
get
such
a
quantity
of
provisions
brought
down
to
lat
that
we
should
be
able
to
regard
this
latitude
as
the
real
of
the
actual
sledge
journey
to
the
pole
we
shall
see
later
that
this
hope
was
more
than
fulfilled
and
a
labour
many
times
greater
than
this
was
performed
by
the
time
this
depot
work
was
accomplished
winter
would
be
before
us
and
with
the
knowledge
we
had
of
the
conditions
in
the
antarctic
regions
every
precaution
would
have
to
be
taken
to
meet
the
coldest
and
probably
the
most
stormy
weather
that
any
polar
expedition
had
hitherto
encountered
my
object
was
when
winter
had
once
set
in
and
everything
in
the
station
was
in
good
working
order
to
concentrate
all
our
forces
upon
the
one
object
that
of
reaching
the
pole
i
intended
to
try
to
get
people
with
me
who
were
specially
fitted
for
outdoor
work
in
the
cold
even
more
necessary
was
it
to
find
men
who
were
experienced
i
saw
what
a
decisive
bearing
this
would
have
on
the
result
there
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
having
experienced
people
with
one
on
an
expedition
like
this
the
advantages
are
obvious
if
a
variety
of
experiences
are
brought
together
and
used
with
common
sense
of
course
a
great
deal
can
be
achieved
the
experience
of
one
man
will
often
come
in
opportunely
where
that
of
another
falls
short
the
experiences
of
several
will
supplement
each
other
and
form
something
like
a
perfect
whole
this
is
what
i
hoped
to
obtain
but
there
is
no
rose
without
a
thorn
if
it
has
its
advantages
it
also
has
its
drawbacks
the
drawback
to
which
one
is
liable
in
this
case
is
that
someone
or
other
may
think
he
possesses
so
much
experience
that
every
opinion
but
his
own
is
worthless
it
is
of
course
regrettable
when
experience
takes
this
turn
but
with
patience
and
common
sense
it
can
be
broken
of
it
in
any
case
the
advantages
are
so
great
and
predominant
that
i
had
determined
to
have
experienced
men
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
it
was
my
plan
to
devote
the
entire
winter
to
working
at
our
outfit
and
to
get
it
as
near
to
perfection
as
possible
another
thing
to
which
we
should
have
to
give
some
time
was
the
killing
of
a
sufficient
number
of
seals
to
provide
fresh
meat
both
for
ourselves
and
our
dogs
for
the
whole
time
scurvy
the
worst
enemy
of
polar
expeditions
must
be
kept
off
at
all
costs
and
to
achieve
this
it
was
my
intention
to
use
fresh
meat
every
day
it
proved
easy
to
carry
out
this
rule
since
everyone
without
exception
preferred
seal
meat
to
tinned
foods
and
when
spring
came
i
hoped
that
my
companions
and
i
would
be
ready
fit
and
well
with
an
outfit
complete
in
every
way
the
plan
was
to
leave
the
station
as
early
in
the
spring
as
possible
if
we
had
set
out
to
capture
this
record
we
must
at
any
cost
get
there
first
everything
must
be
staked
upon
this
from
the
very
moment
when
i
had
formed
the
plan
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
our
course
from
the
bay
of
whales
must
be
set
due
south
and
follow
the
same
meridian
if
possible
right
up
to
the
pole
the
effect
of
this
would
be
that
we
should
traverse
an
entirely
new
region
and
gain
other
results
besides
beating
the
record
i
was
greatly
astonished
to
hear
on
my
return
from
the
south
that
some
people
had
actually
believed
we
had
set
our
course
from
the
bay
of
whales
for
beardmore
glacier
shackleton
route
and
followed
it
to
the
south
let
me
hasten
to
assure
them
that
this
idea
never
for
a
single
instant
crossed
my
mind
when
i
made
the
plan
scott
had
announced
that
he
was
going
to
take
shackleton
route
and
that
decided
the
matter
during
our
long
stay
at
framheim
not
one
of
us
ever
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
such
a
course
without
discussion
scott
route
was
declared
out
of
bounds
no
due
south
was
our
way
and
the
country
would
have
to
be
difficult
indeed
to
stop
our
getting
on
to
the
plateau
our
plan
was
to
go
south
and
not
to
leave
the
meridian
unless
we
were
forced
to
do
so
by
insuperable
difficulties
i
foresaw
of
course
that
there
would
be
some
who
would
attack
me
and
accuse
me
of
shabby
rivalry
and
they
would
perhaps
have
had
some
shadow
of
justification
if
we
had
really
thought
of
taking
captain
scott
route
but
it
never
occurred
to
us
for
a
moment
our
lay
geographical
miles
from
scott
winter
quarters
in
mcmurdo
sound
so
there
could
be
no
question
of
encroaching
upon
his
sphere
of
action
moreover
professor
nansen
in
his
direct
and
convincing
way
has
put
an
end
once
for
all
to
this
twaddle
so
that
i
need
not
dwell
upon
it
any
longer
i
worked
out
the
plan
as
here
given
at
my
home
on
bundefjord
near
christiania
in
september
and
as
it
was
laid
so
was
it
carried
out
to
the
last
detail
that
my
estimate
of
the
time
it
would
take
was
not
so
very
far
out
is
proved
by
the
final
sentence
of
the
plan
thus
we
shall
be
back
from
the
polar
journey
on
january
it
was
on
january
that
we
came
into
framheim
after
our
successful
journey
to
the
pole
this
was
not
the
only
time
our
calculations
proved
correct
captain
nilsen
showed
himself
to
be
a
veritable
magician
in
this
way
while
i
contented
myself
with
reckoning
dates
he
did
not
hesitate
to
go
into
hours
he
calculated
that
we
should
reach
the
barrier
on
january
this
is
a
distance
of
geographical
miles
from
norway
we
were
at
the
barrier
on
january
one
day
before
the
time
there
was
not
much
wrong
with
that
estimate
in
accordance
with
the
storthing
resolution
of
february
the
fram
was
lent
for
the
use
of
the
expedition
and
a
sum
of
kroner
pounds
sterling
was
voted
for
repairs
and
necessary
alterations
the
provisions
were
chosen
with
the
greatest
care
and
packed
with
every
precaution
all
groceries
were
soldered
in
tin
boxes
and
then
enclosed
in
strong
wooden
cases
the
packing
of
tinned
provisions
is
of
enormous
importance
to
a
polar
expedition
it
is
impossible
to
give
too
much
attention
to
this
part
of
the
supplies
any
carelessness
any
perfunctory
packing
on
the
part
of
the
factory
will
as
a
rule
lead
to
scurvy
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
on
the
four
norwegian
polar
expeditions
the
three
voyages
of
the
fram
and
the
gjoa
voyage
not
a
single
case
of
scurvy
occurred
this
is
good
evidence
of
the
care
with
which
these
expeditions
were
provisioned
in
this
matter
we
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
above
all
to
professor
sophus
torup
who
has
always
been
the
supervising
authority
in
the
matter
of
provisioning
this
time
as
well
as
on
the
former
occasions
great
praise
is
also
due
to
the
factories
that
supplied
our
tinned
goods
by
their
excellent
and
conscientious
work
they
deserved
well
of
the
expedition
in
this
case
a
part
of
the
supplies
was
entrusted
to
a
stavanger
factory
which
in
addition
to
the
goods
supplied
to
order
with
great
generosity
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
expedition
provisions
to
the
value
of
kroner
the
other
half
of
the
tinned
foods
required
was
ordered
from
a
firm
at
moss
the
manager
of
this
firm
undertook
at
the
same
time
to
prepare
the
necessary
pemmican
for
men
and
dogs
and
executed
this
commission
in
a
way
that
i
can
not
sufficiently
praise
thanks
to
this
excellent
preparation
the
health
both
of
men
and
dogs
on
the
journey
to
the
pole
was
always
remarkably
good
the
pemmican
we
took
was
essentially
different
from
that
which
former
expeditions
had
used
previously
the
pemmican
had
contained
nothing
but
the
desired
mixture
of
dried
meat
and
lard
ours
had
besides
these
vegetables
and
oatmeal
an
addition
which
greatly
improves
its
flavour
and
as
far
as
we
could
judge
makes
it
easier
to
digest
this
kind
of
pemmican
was
first
produced
for
the
use
of
the
norwegian
army
it
was
intended
to
take
the
place
of
the
emergency
ration
the
experiment
was
not
concluded
at
the
time
the
expedition
left
but
it
may
be
hoped
that
the
result
has
proved
satisfactory
a
more
stimulating
nourishing
and
appetizing
food
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
but
besides
the
pemmican
for
ourselves
that
for
our
dogs
was
equally
important
for
they
are
just
as
liable
to
be
attacked
by
scurvy
as
we
men
the
same
care
had
therefore
to
be
devoted
to
the
preparation
of
their
food
we
obtained
from
moss
two
kinds
of
pemmican
one
made
with
fish
and
the
other
with
meat
both
kinds
contained
besides
the
dried
fish
or
meat
and
lard
a
certain
proportion
of
dried
milk
and
middlings
both
kinds
were
equally
excellent
and
the
dogs
were
always
in
splendid
condition
the
pemmican
was
divided
into
rations
of
pound
ounces
and
could
be
served
out
to
the
dogs
as
it
was
but
before
we
should
be
able
to
use
this
pemmican
we
had
a
five
voyage
before
us
and
for
this
part
of
the
expedition
i
had
to
look
for
a
reliable
supply
of
dried
fish
this
i
found
through
the
agent
of
the
expedition
at
tromso
fritz
zappfe
two
firms
also
placed
large
quantities
of
the
best
dried
fish
at
my
disposal
with
all
this
excellent
fish
and
some
barrels
of
lard
we
succeeded
in
bringing
our
dogs
through
in
the
best
of
condition
one
of
the
most
important
of
our
preparations
was
to
find
good
dogs
as
i
have
said
i
had
to
act
with
decision
and
promptitude
if
i
was
to
succeed
in
getting
everything
in
order
the
day
after
my
decision
was
made
therefore
i
was
on
my
way
to
copenhagen
where
the
inspectors
for
greenland
and
bentzen
were
to
be
found
at
that
moment
the
director
of
the
royal
greenland
trading
company
rydberg
showed
as
before
the
most
friendly
interest
in
my
undertaking
and
gave
the
inspectors
a
free
hand
i
then
negotiated
with
these
gentlemen
and
they
undertook
to
provide
of
the
finest
greenland
dogs
and
to
deliver
them
in
norway
in
july
the
dog
question
was
thus
as
good
as
solved
since
the
choice
was
placed
in
the
most
expert
hands
i
was
personally
acquainted
with
inspector
from
former
dealings
with
him
and
knew
that
whatever
he
undertook
would
be
performed
with
the
greatest
conscientiousness
the
administration
of
the
royal
greenland
trading
company
gave
permission
for
the
dogs
to
be
conveyed
free
of
charge
on
board
the
hans
egede
and
delivered
at
christiansand
before
i
proceed
to
our
further
equipment
i
must
say
a
few
more
words
about
the
dogs
the
greatest
difference
between
scott
and
my
equipment
lay
undoubtedly
in
our
choice
of
draught
animals
we
had
heard
that
scott
relying
on
his
own
experience
and
that
of
shackleton
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
manchurian
ponies
were
superior
to
dogs
on
the
barrier
among
those
who
were
acquainted
with
the
eskimo
dog
i
do
not
suppose
i
was
the
only
one
who
was
startled
on
first
hearing
this
afterwards
as
i
read
the
different
narratives
and
was
able
to
form
an
accurate
opinion
of
the
conditions
of
surface
and
going
my
astonishment
became
even
greater
although
i
had
never
seen
this
part
of
the
antarctic
regions
i
was
not
long
in
forming
an
opinion
diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
shackleton
and
scott
for
the
conditions
both
of
going
and
surface
were
precisely
what
one
would
desire
for
sledging
with
eskimo
dogs
to
judge
from
the
descriptions
of
these
explorers
if
peary
could
make
a
record
trip
on
the
arctic
ice
with
dogs
one
ought
surely
with
equally
good
tackle
to
be
able
to
beat
peary
record
on
the
splendidly
even
surface
of
the
barrier
there
must
be
some
misunderstanding
or
other
at
the
bottom
of
the
englishmen
estimate
of
the
eskimo
dog
utility
in
the
polar
regions
can
it
be
that
the
dog
has
not
understood
his
master
or
is
it
the
master
who
has
not
understood
his
dog
the
right
footing
must
be
established
from
the
outset
the
dog
must
understand
that
he
has
to
obey
in
everything
and
the
master
must
know
how
to
make
himself
respected
if
obedience
is
once
established
i
am
convinced
that
the
dog
will
be
superior
to
all
other
draught
animals
over
these
long
distances
another
very
important
reason
for
using
the
dog
is
that
this
small
creature
can
much
more
easily
cross
the
numerous
slight
that
are
not
to
be
avoided
on
the
barrier
and
on
the
glaciers
if
a
dog
falls
into
a
crevasse
there
is
no
great
harm
done
a
tug
at
his
harness
and
he
is
out
again
but
it
is
another
matter
with
a
pony
this
comparatively
large
and
heavy
animal
of
course
falls
through
far
more
easily
and
if
this
happens
it
is
a
long
and
stiff
job
to
get
the
beast
hauled
up
again
unless
indeed
the
traces
have
broken
and
the
pony
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
crevasse
feet
deep
and
then
there
is
the
obvious
advantage
that
dog
can
be
fed
on
dog
one
can
reduce
one
pack
little
by
little
slaughtering
the
feebler
ones
and
feeding
the
chosen
with
them
in
this
way
they
get
fresh
meat
our
dogs
lived
on
dog
flesh
and
pemmican
the
whole
way
and
this
enabled
them
to
do
splendid
work
and
if
we
ourselves
wanted
a
piece
of
fresh
meat
we
could
cut
off
a
delicate
little
fillet
it
tasted
to
us
as
good
as
the
best
beef
the
dogs
do
not
object
at
all
as
long
as
they
get
their
share
they
do
not
mind
what
part
of
their
comrade
carcass
it
comes
from
all
that
was
left
after
one
of
these
canine
meals
was
the
teeth
of
the
victim
and
if
it
had
been
a
really
hard
day
these
also
disappeared
if
we
take
a
step
farther
from
the
barrier
to
the
plateau
it
would
seem
that
every
doubt
of
the
dog
superiority
must
disappear
not
only
can
one
get
the
dogs
up
over
the
huge
glaciers
that
lead
to
the
plateau
but
one
can
make
full
use
of
them
the
whole
way
ponies
on
the
other
hand
have
to
be
left
at
the
foot
of
the
glacier
while
the
men
themselves
have
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
acting
as
ponies
as
i
understand
shackleton
account
there
can
be
no
question
of
hauling
the
ponies
over
the
steep
and
crevassed
glaciers
it
must
be
rather
hard
to
have
to
abandon
one
motive
power
voluntarily
when
only
a
quarter
of
the
distance
has
been
covered
i
for
my
part
prefer
to
use
it
all
the
way
from
the
very
beginning
i
saw
that
the
first
part
of
our
expedition
from
norway
to
the
barrier
would
be
the
most
dangerous
section
if
we
could
only
reach
the
barrier
with
our
dogs
safe
and
well
the
future
would
be
bright
enough
fortunately
all
my
comrades
took
the
same
view
of
the
matter
and
with
their
cooperation
we
succeeded
not
only
in
bringing
the
dogs
safely
to
our
field
of
operations
but
in
landing
them
in
far
better
condition
than
when
we
received
them
their
number
was
also
considerably
increased
on
the
way
which
seems
to
be
another
proof
of
a
flourishing
state
of
things
to
protect
them
against
damp
and
heat
we
laid
a
loose
deck
of
planed
boards
about
inches
above
the
fixed
deck
an
arrangement
by
which
all
the
rain
and
spray
ran
underneath
the
dogs
in
this
way
we
kept
them
out
of
the
water
which
must
always
be
running
from
side
to
side
on
the
deck
of
a
vessel
on
her
way
to
the
antarctic
ocean
going
through
the
tropics
this
loose
deck
did
double
service
it
always
afforded
a
somewhat
cool
surface
as
there
was
a
fresh
current
of
air
between
the
two
decks
the
main
deck
which
was
black
with
tar
would
have
been
unbearably
hot
for
the
animals
the
false
deck
was
high
and
kept
fairly
white
during
the
whole
voyage
we
carried
awnings
in
addition
chiefly
on
account
of
the
dogs
these
awnings
could
be
stretched
over
the
whole
vessel
and
give
the
dogs
constant
protection
from
the
burning
sun
i
still
can
not
help
smiling
when
i
think
of
the
compassionate
voices
that
were
raised
here
and
there
and
even
made
their
way
into
print
about
the
cruelty
to
animals
on
board
the
fram
presumably
these
cries
came
from
individuals
who
themselves
kept
tied
up
besides
our
companions
we
took
with
us
a
one
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
serious
work
in
the
polar
regions
as
for
pleasant
entertainment
on
the
way
this
was
our
canary
fridtjof
it
was
one
of
the
many
presents
made
to
the
expedition
and
not
the
least
welcome
of
them
it
began
to
sing
as
soon
as
it
came
on
board
and
has
now
kept
it
going
on
two
circumnavigations
through
the
most
inhospitable
waters
of
the
earth
it
probably
holds
the
record
as
a
polar
traveller
among
its
kind
later
on
we
had
a
considerable
collection
of
various
families
pigs
fowls
sheep
cats
and
rats
yes
unfortunately
we
knew
what
it
was
to
have
rats
on
board
the
most
repulsive
of
all
creatures
and
the
worst
vermin
i
know
of
but
we
have
declared
war
against
them
and
off
they
shall
go
before
the
fram
starts
on
her
next
voyage
we
got
them
in
buenos
aires
and
the
best
thing
will
be
to
bury
them
in
their
native
land
on
account
of
the
rather
straitened
circumstances
the
expedition
had
to
contend
with
i
had
to
look
twice
at
every
shilling
before
i
spent
it
articles
of
clothing
are
an
important
factor
in
a
polar
expedition
and
i
consider
it
necessary
that
the
expedition
should
provide
each
of
its
members
with
the
actual
polar
clothing
if
one
left
this
part
of
the
equipment
to
each
individual
i
am
afraid
things
would
look
badly
before
the
journey
was
done
i
must
admit
that
there
was
some
temptation
to
do
this
it
would
have
been
very
much
cheaper
if
i
had
simply
given
each
man
a
list
of
what
clothes
he
was
required
to
provide
for
himself
but
by
so
doing
i
should
have
missed
the
opportunity
of
personally
supervising
the
quality
of
the
clothing
to
the
extent
i
desired
it
was
not
an
outfit
that
cut
a
dash
by
its
appearance
but
it
was
warm
and
strong
from
the
commissariat
stores
at
horten
i
obtained
many
excellent
articles
i
owe
captain
pedersen
the
present
chief
of
the
commissariat
department
my
heartiest
thanks
for
the
courtesy
he
always
showed
me
when
i
came
to
get
things
out
of
him
through
him
i
had
about
blankets
served
out
to
me
now
the
reader
must
not
imagine
a
bed
and
bedding
such
as
he
may
see
exhibited
in
the
windows
of
furniture
shops
with
thick
white
blankets
so
delicate
that
in
spite
of
their
thickness
they
look
as
if
they
might
float
away
of
their
own
accord
so
light
and
fine
do
they
appear
it
was
not
blankets
like
these
that
captain
pedersen
gave
us
we
should
not
have
known
what
to
do
with
them
if
he
had
the
blankets
the
commissariat
gave
us
were
of
an
entirely
different
sort
as
to
their
colour
well
i
can
only
call
it
indeterminable
and
they
did
not
give
one
the
impression
that
they
would
float
away
either
if
one
let
go
of
them
no
they
would
keep
on
the
ground
right
enough
they
were
felted
and
pressed
together
into
a
thick
hard
mass
from
the
dawn
of
time
they
had
served
our
brave
warriors
at
sea
and
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
some
of
them
had
gruesome
stories
to
tell
of
the
days
of
tordenskjold
the
first
thing
i
did
on
obtaining
possession
of
these
treasures
was
to
get
them
into
the
they
were
unrecognizable
when
i
got
them
back
in
ultramarine
blue
or
whatever
it
was
called
the
metamorphosis
was
complete
their
warlike
past
was
wiped
out
my
intention
was
to
have
these
two
hundred
blankets
made
into
polar
clothing
and
i
took
counsel
with
myself
how
i
might
get
this
done
to
disclose
the
origin
of
the
stuff
would
be
an
unfortunate
policy
no
tailor
in
the
world
would
make
clothes
out
of
old
blankets
i
was
pretty
sure
of
that
i
had
to
hit
upon
some
stratagem
i
heard
of
a
man
who
was
a
capable
worker
at
his
trade
and
asked
him
to
come
and
see
me
my
office
looked
exactly
like
a
woollen
warehouse
with
blankets
everywhere
the
tailor
arrived
was
that
the
stuff
yes
that
was
it
just
imported
from
abroad
a
great
bargain
a
lot
of
samples
dirt
cheap
i
had
put
on
my
most
innocent
and
unconcerned
expression
i
saw
the
tailor
glance
at
me
sideways
i
suppose
he
thought
the
samples
were
rather
large
a
closely
woven
stuff
said
he
holding
it
up
to
the
light
i
could
almost
swear
it
was
we
went
carefully
through
every
single
sample
and
took
the
number
it
was
a
long
and
tedious
business
and
i
was
glad
when
i
saw
that
at
last
we
were
nearing
the
end
over
in
a
corner
there
lay
a
few
more
we
had
reached
the
one
hundred
and
so
there
could
not
be
many
in
the
pile
i
was
occupied
with
something
else
and
the
tailor
went
through
the
remainder
by
himself
i
was
just
congratulating
myself
on
the
apparently
fortunate
result
of
the
morning
work
when
i
was
startled
by
an
exclamation
from
the
man
in
the
corner
it
sounded
like
the
bellow
of
a
mad
bull
alas
there
stood
the
tailor
enveloped
in
ultramarine
and
swinging
over
his
head
a
blanket
the
couleur
changeante
of
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
the
origin
of
the
directly
imported
goods
with
a
look
of
thunder
the
man
quitted
me
and
i
sank
in
black
despair
i
never
saw
him
again
the
fact
was
that
in
my
hurry
i
had
forgotten
the
sample
blanket
that
captain
pedersen
had
sent
me
that
was
the
cause
of
the
catastrophe
well
i
finally
succeeded
in
getting
the
work
executed
and
it
is
certain
that
no
expedition
has
ever
had
warmer
and
stronger
clothing
than
this
it
was
in
great
favour
on
board
i
also
thought
it
best
to
provide
good
oilskins
and
especially
good
for
every
man
the
were
therefore
made
to
measure
and
of
the
very
best
material
i
had
them
made
by
the
firm
i
have
always
regarded
as
the
best
in
that
branch
how
then
shall
i
describe
our
grief
when
on
the
day
we
were
to
wear
our
beautiful
we
discovered
that
most
of
them
were
useless
some
of
the
men
could
dance
a
hornpipe
in
theirs
without
taking
the
boots
off
the
deck
others
by
exerting
all
their
strength
could
not
squeeze
their
foot
through
the
narrow
way
and
reach
paradise
the
leg
was
so
narrow
that
even
the
most
delicate
little
foot
could
not
get
through
it
and
to
make
up
for
this
the
foot
of
the
boot
was
so
huge
that
it
could
comfortably
accommodate
twice
as
much
as
its
owner
could
show
very
few
were
able
to
wear
their
boots
we
tried
changing
but
that
was
no
use
the
boots
were
not
made
for
any
creatures
of
this
planet
but
sailors
are
sailors
wherever
they
may
be
it
is
not
easy
to
beat
them
most
of
them
knew
the
proverb
that
one
pair
of
boots
that
fit
is
better
than
ten
pairs
that
you
ca
put
on
and
had
brought
their
own
with
them
and
so
we
got
out
of
that
difficulty
we
took
three
sets
of
linen
underclothing
for
every
man
to
wear
in
the
warm
regions
this
part
of
the
equipment
was
left
to
each
individual
most
men
possess
a
few
old
shirts
and
not
much
more
is
wanted
through
the
tropics
for
the
cold
regions
there
were
two
sets
of
extra
thick
woollen
underclothing
two
thick
woollen
jerseys
six
pairs
of
knitted
stockings
iceland
and
other
lighter
jackets
socks
and
stockings
from
the
penitentiary
besides
these
we
had
a
quantity
of
clothing
from
the
army
depots
i
owe
many
thanks
to
general
keilhau
for
the
kind
way
in
which
he
fell
in
with
all
my
wishes
from
this
quarter
we
obtained
outer
clothing
for
both
cold
and
warm
climates
underclothes
boots
shoes
and
cloths
of
different
kinds
as
the
last
item
of
our
personal
equipment
i
may
mention
that
each
man
had
a
suit
of
sealskin
from
greenland
then
there
were
such
things
as
needles
of
all
possible
sizes
buttons
scissors
tapes
broad
and
narrow
black
and
white
blue
and
red
i
may
safely
assert
that
nothing
was
forgotten
we
were
well
and
amply
equipped
in
every
way
another
side
of
our
preparations
which
claimed
some
attention
was
the
fitting
up
of
the
quarters
we
were
to
inhabit
the
saloons
and
cabins
what
an
immense
difference
it
makes
if
one
lives
in
comfortable
surroundings
for
my
part
i
can
do
twice
the
amount
of
work
when
i
see
tidiness
and
comfort
around
me
the
saloons
on
the
fram
were
very
handsomely
and
tastefully
fitted
here
we
owe
in
the
first
place
our
respectful
thanks
to
king
haakon
and
queen
maud
for
the
photographs
they
presented
to
us
they
were
the
most
precious
of
our
gifts
the
ladies
of
horten
gave
us
a
number
of
pretty
things
for
decorating
the
cabins
and
they
will
no
doubt
be
glad
to
hear
of
the
admiration
they
aroused
wherever
we
went
is
this
really
a
polar
ship
people
asked
we
expected
to
see
nothing
but
wooden
benches
and
bare
walls
and
they
began
to
talk
about
boudoirs
and
things
of
that
sort
besides
splendid
embroideries
our
walls
were
decorated
with
the
most
wonderful
photographs
it
would
have
rejoiced
the
giver
of
these
to
hear
all
the
words
of
praise
that
have
been
bestowed
upon
them
the
sleeping
quarters
i
left
to
individual
taste
every
man
could
take
a
bit
of
his
home
in
his
own
little
compartment
the
bedclothes
came
from
the
naval
factory
at
horten
they
were
work
like
everything
else
that
came
from
there
we
owe
our
best
thanks
to
the
giver
of
the
soft
blankets
that
have
so
often
been
our
joy
and
put
warmth
into
us
after
a
bitter
day
they
came
from
a
woollen
mill
at
trondhjem
i
must
also
mention
our
which
was
in
all
respects
as
fine
and
elegant
as
it
could
possibly
be
the
most
exquisite
notepaper
stamped
with
a
picture
of
the
fram
and
the
name
of
the
expedition
in
large
and
small
size
broad
and
narrow
old
style
and
new
style
every
kind
of
notepaper
in
fact
of
pens
and
penholders
pencils
black
and
coloured
indian
ink
and
other
kinds
of
pins
ink
and
white
chalk
and
red
chalk
gum
arabic
and
other
gums
and
almanacs
ship
logs
and
private
diaries
notebooks
and
sledging
diaries
and
many
other
things
of
the
same
sort
we
have
such
a
stock
that
we
shall
be
able
to
circumnavigate
the
earth
several
times
more
before
running
short
this
gift
does
honour
to
the
firm
which
sent
it
every
time
i
have
sent
a
letter
or
written
in
my
diary
i
have
had
a
grateful
thought
for
the
givers
from
one
of
the
largest
houses
in
christiania
we
had
a
complete
set
of
kitchen
utensils
and
breakfast
and
dinner
services
all
of
the
best
kind
the
cups
plates
knives
forks
spoons
jugs
glasses
were
all
marked
with
the
ship
name
we
carried
an
extraordinarily
copious
library
presents
of
books
were
showered
upon
us
in
great
quantities
i
suppose
the
fram
library
at
the
present
moment
contains
at
least
volumes
for
our
entertainment
we
also
had
a
good
many
different
games
one
of
these
became
our
favourite
pastime
in
leisure
evenings
down
in
the
south
packs
of
cards
we
had
by
the
dozen
and
many
of
them
have
already
been
well
used
a
gramophone
with
a
large
supply
of
records
was
i
think
our
best
friend
of
musical
instruments
we
had
a
piano
a
violin
a
flute
mandolins
not
forgetting
a
and
an
accordion
all
the
publishers
had
been
kind
enough
to
send
us
music
so
that
we
could
cultivate
this
art
as
much
as
we
wished
christmas
presents
streamed
in
from
all
sides
i
suppose
we
had
about
five
hundred
on
board
and
decorations
for
them
with
many
other
things
to
amuse
us
at
christmas
were
sent
with
us
by
friends
and
acquaintances
people
have
indeed
been
kind
to
us
and
i
can
assure
the
givers
that
all
their
presents
have
been
and
are
still
much
appreciated
we
were
well
supplied
with
wines
and
spirits
thanks
to
one
of
the
largest
firms
of
in
christiania
an
occasional
glass
of
wine
or
a
tot
of
spirits
were
things
that
we
all
without
exception
were
very
glad
of
the
question
of
alcohol
on
polar
expeditions
has
often
been
discussed
personally
i
regard
alcohol
used
in
moderation
as
a
medicine
in
the
polar
regions
i
mean
of
course
so
long
as
one
is
in
winter
quarters
it
is
another
matter
on
sledge
journeys
there
we
all
know
from
experience
that
alcohol
must
be
banished
not
because
a
drink
of
spirits
can
do
any
harm
but
on
account
of
the
weight
and
space
on
sledging
journeys
one
has
of
course
to
save
weight
as
much
as
possible
and
to
take
only
what
is
strictly
necessary
and
i
do
not
include
alcohol
under
the
head
of
strictly
necessary
things
nor
was
it
only
in
winter
quarters
that
we
had
use
for
alcohol
but
also
on
the
long
monotonous
voyage
through
raw
cold
and
stormy
regions
a
tot
of
spirits
is
often
a
very
good
thing
when
one
goes
below
after
a
bitter
watch
on
deck
and
is
just
turning
in
a
total
abstainer
will
no
doubt
turn
up
his
nose
and
ask
whether
a
cup
of
good
warm
coffee
would
not
do
as
well
for
my
part
i
think
the
quantity
of
coffee
people
pour
into
themselves
at
such
times
is
far
more
harmful
than
a
little
lysholmer
snaps
and
think
of
the
important
part
a
glass
of
wine
or
toddy
plays
in
social
gatherings
on
such
a
voyage
two
men
who
have
fallen
out
a
little
in
the
course
of
the
week
are
reconciled
at
once
by
the
scent
of
rum
the
past
is
forgotten
and
they
start
afresh
in
friendly
take
alcohol
away
from
these
little
festivities
and
you
will
soon
see
the
difference
it
is
a
sad
thing
someone
will
say
that
men
absolutely
must
have
alcohol
to
put
them
in
a
good
humour
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
agree
but
seeing
that
our
nature
is
what
it
is
we
must
try
to
make
the
best
of
it
it
seems
as
though
we
civilized
human
beings
must
have
stimulating
drinks
and
that
being
so
we
have
to
follow
our
own
convictions
i
am
for
a
glass
of
toddy
let
who
will
eat
and
swill
hot
coffee
heartburn
and
other
troubles
are
often
the
result
of
this
kind
of
refreshment
a
little
toddy
does
hurt
anybody
the
consumption
of
alcohol
on
the
fram
third
voyage
was
as
follows
one
dram
and
fifteen
drops
at
dinner
on
wednesdays
and
sundays
and
a
glass
of
toddy
on
saturday
evenings
on
holidays
there
was
an
additional
allowance
we
were
all
well
supplied
with
tobacco
and
cigars
from
various
firms
at
home
and
abroad
we
had
enough
cigars
to
allow
us
one
each
on
saturday
evenings
and
after
dinner
on
sundays
two
christiania
manufacturers
sent
us
their
finest
bonbons
and
drops
and
a
foreign
firm
gave
us
gala
peter
so
that
it
was
no
rare
thing
to
see
the
polar
explorers
helping
themselves
to
a
sweetmeat
or
a
piece
of
chocolate
an
establishment
at
drammen
gave
us
as
much
fruit
syrup
as
we
could
drink
and
if
the
giver
only
knew
how
many
times
we
blessed
the
excellent
product
he
supplied
i
am
sure
he
would
be
pleased
on
the
homeward
march
from
the
pole
we
looked
forward
every
day
to
getting
nearer
to
our
supply
of
syrup
from
three
different
firms
in
christiania
we
received
all
our
requirements
in
the
way
of
cheese
biscuits
tea
sugar
and
coffee
the
packing
of
the
was
so
efficient
that
although
the
coffee
was
roasted
it
is
still
as
fresh
and
aromatic
as
the
day
it
left
the
warehouse
another
firm
sent
us
soap
enough
for
five
years
and
one
uses
a
good
deal
of
that
commodity
even
on
a
polar
voyage
a
man
in
christiania
had
seen
to
the
care
of
our
skin
hair
and
teeth
and
it
is
not
his
fault
if
we
have
not
delicate
skins
abundant
growth
of
hair
and
teeth
like
pearls
for
the
outfit
was
certainly
complete
enough
an
important
item
of
the
equipment
is
the
medical
department
and
here
my
advisers
were
jacob
roll
and
holth
therefore
nothing
was
wanting
a
chemist
in
christiania
supplied
all
the
necessary
medicines
as
a
contribution
carefully
chosen
and
beautifully
arranged
unfortunately
no
doctor
accompanied
the
expedition
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
take
all
the
responsibility
myself
lieutenant
gjertsen
who
had
a
pronounced
aptitude
both
for
drawing
teeth
and
amputating
legs
went
through
a
lightning
course
at
the
hospital
and
the
dental
hospital
he
clearly
showed
that
much
may
be
learnt
in
a
short
time
by
giving
one
mind
to
it
with
surprising
rapidity
and
apparent
confidence
lieutenant
gjertsen
disposed
of
the
most
complicated
cases
whether
invariably
to
the
patient
advantage
is
another
question
which
i
shall
leave
undecided
he
drew
teeth
with
a
dexterity
that
strongly
reminded
one
of
the
conjurer
art
one
moment
he
showed
an
empty
pair
of
forceps
the
next
there
was
a
big
molar
in
their
grip
the
yells
one
heard
while
the
operation
was
in
progress
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
entirely
painless
a
match
factory
gave
us
all
the
safety
matches
we
wanted
they
were
packed
so
securely
that
we
could
quite
well
have
towed
the
cases
after
us
in
the
sea
all
the
way
and
found
the
matches
perfectly
dry
on
arrival
we
had
a
quantity
of
ammunition
and
explosives
as
the
whole
of
the
lower
hold
was
full
of
petroleum
the
fram
had
a
rather
dangerous
cargo
on
board
we
therefore
took
all
possible
precautions
against
fire
extinguishing
apparatus
was
fitted
in
every
cabin
and
wherever
practicable
and
pumps
with
hose
were
always
in
readiness
on
deck
the
necessary
such
as
saws
from
to
metres
long
were
not
forgotten
we
had
a
number
of
scientific
instruments
with
us
professors
nansen
and
had
devoted
many
an
hour
to
our
oceanographical
equipment
which
was
therefore
a
model
of
what
such
an
equipment
should
be
lieutenants
prestrud
and
gjertsen
had
both
gone
through
the
necessary
course
in
oceanography
under
at
the
bergen
biological
station
i
myself
had
spent
a
summer
there
and
taken
part
in
one
of
the
oceanographical
courses
professor
was
a
brilliant
teacher
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
assert
that
i
was
an
equally
brilliant
pupil
professor
mohn
had
given
us
a
complete
meteorological
outfit
among
the
instruments
belonging
to
the
fram
i
may
mention
a
pendulum
apparatus
an
excellent
astronomical
theodolite
and
a
sextant
lieutenant
prestrud
studied
the
use
of
the
pendulum
apparatus
under
professor
schiotz
and
the
use
of
the
astronomical
theodolite
under
professor
geelmuyden
we
had
in
addition
several
sextants
and
artificial
horizons
both
glass
and
mercury
we
had
binoculars
of
all
sizes
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
so
far
i
have
been
dealing
with
our
general
outfit
and
shall
now
pass
to
the
special
equipment
of
the
shore
party
the
hut
we
took
out
was
built
on
my
property
on
bundefjord
so
that
i
was
able
to
watch
the
work
as
it
progressed
it
was
built
by
the
brothers
hans
and
jorgen
stubberud
and
was
throughout
a
splendid
piece
of
work
which
did
honour
to
both
the
brothers
the
materials
proved
excellent
in
every
way
the
hut
was
feet
long
by
feet
wide
its
height
from
the
floor
to
the
ridge
of
the
roof
was
about
feet
it
was
built
as
an
ordinary
norwegian
house
with
pointed
gable
and
had
two
rooms
one
of
these
was
feet
long
and
was
to
serve
as
our
dormitory
and
the
other
room
was
feet
long
and
was
to
be
lindstrom
kitchen
from
the
kitchen
a
double
led
to
the
loft
where
we
intended
to
keep
a
quantity
of
provisions
and
outfit
the
walls
consisted
of
planks
with
air
space
between
panels
outside
and
inside
with
air
space
between
them
and
the
plank
walling
for
insulation
we
used
cellulose
pulp
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
between
the
rooms
and
the
loft
were
double
while
the
upper
roof
was
single
the
doors
were
extraordinarily
thick
and
strong
and
fitted
into
oblique
grooves
so
that
they
closed
very
tightly
there
were
two
windows
a
triple
one
in
the
end
wall
of
the
main
room
and
a
double
one
in
the
kitchen
for
the
covering
of
the
roof
we
took
out
and
for
the
floor
linoleum
in
the
main
room
there
were
two
one
to
admit
fresh
air
the
other
for
the
exhaust
there
were
bunks
for
ten
men
in
two
stages
six
on
one
wall
and
four
on
the
other
the
furniture
of
the
room
consisted
of
a
table
a
stool
for
each
man
and
a
lux
lamp
one
half
of
the
kitchen
was
occupied
by
the
range
the
other
by
shelves
and
cooking
utensils
the
hut
was
tarred
several
times
and
every
part
was
carefully
marked
so
that
it
could
easily
be
set
up
to
fasten
it
to
the
ground
and
prevent
the
antarctic
storms
from
blowing
it
away
i
had
strong
eyebolts
screwed
into
each
end
of
the
and
the
four
corners
of
the
roof
we
carried
six
strong
eyebolts
a
metre
long
to
be
rammed
into
the
barrier
between
these
bolts
and
those
on
the
hut
steel
wires
were
to
be
stretched
which
could
be
drawn
quite
tight
we
also
had
two
spare
cables
which
could
be
stretched
over
the
roof
if
the
gales
were
too
severe
the
two
ventilating
pipes
and
the
chimney
were
secured
outside
with
strong
stays
as
will
be
seen
every
precaution
was
taken
to
make
the
hut
warm
and
comfortable
and
to
hold
it
down
on
the
ground
we
also
took
on
board
a
quantity
of
loose
timber
boards
and
planks
besides
the
hut
we
took
with
us
fifteen
tents
for
sixteen
men
each
ten
of
these
were
old
but
good
they
were
served
out
to
us
from
the
naval
stores
the
other
five
were
new
and
we
bought
them
from
the
army
depots
it
was
our
intention
to
use
the
tents
as
temporary
houses
they
were
easily
and
quickly
set
up
and
were
strong
and
warm
on
the
voyage
to
the
south
ronne
sewed
new
floors
of
good
strong
canvas
to
the
five
new
tents
all
cases
of
provisions
that
were
intended
for
winter
quarters
were
marked
and
stowed
separately
in
the
hold
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
be
put
out
on
to
the
ice
at
once
we
had
ten
sledges
made
by
a
firm
of
sporting
outfitters
in
christiania
they
were
built
like
the
old
nansen
sledges
but
rather
broader
and
were
feet
long
the
runners
were
of
the
best
american
hickory
shod
with
steel
the
other
parts
were
of
good
tough
norwegian
ash
to
each
sledge
belonged
a
pair
of
spare
runners
which
could
easily
be
fitted
underneath
by
means
of
clamps
and
as
easily
removed
when
not
required
the
steel
shoeing
of
the
runners
was
well
coated
with
red
lead
and
the
spare
runners
with
tar
these
sledges
were
extremely
strongly
built
and
could
stand
all
kinds
of
work
on
every
sort
of
surface
at
that
time
i
did
not
know
the
conditions
on
the
barrier
as
i
afterwards
came
to
know
them
of
course
these
sledges
were
very
heavy
we
took
twenty
pairs
of
ski
all
of
the
finest
hickory
they
were
feet
long
and
proportionately
narrow
i
chose
them
of
this
length
with
a
view
to
being
able
to
cross
the
numerous
cracks
in
the
glaciers
the
greater
the
surface
over
which
the
weight
could
be
distributed
the
better
prospect
we
should
have
of
slipping
over
the
we
had
forty
with
ebonite
points
the
were
a
combination
of
the
huitfeldt
and
the
hoyer
ellefsen
bindings
we
also
had
quantities
of
loose
straps
we
had
six
tents
all
made
in
the
navy
workshops
the
workmanship
could
not
have
been
better
they
were
the
strongest
and
most
practical
tents
that
have
ever
been
used
they
were
made
of
the
closest
canvas
with
the
floor
in
one
piece
one
man
was
sufficient
to
set
up
the
tent
in
the
stiffest
breeze
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fewer
poles
a
tent
has
the
easier
it
is
to
set
up
which
seems
quite
natural
these
tents
have
only
one
pole
how
often
one
reads
in
narratives
of
polar
travel
that
it
took
such
and
such
a
time
often
hours
to
set
up
the
tent
and
then
when
at
last
it
was
up
one
lay
expecting
it
to
be
blown
down
at
any
moment
there
was
no
question
of
this
with
our
tents
they
were
up
in
a
twinkling
and
stood
against
all
kinds
of
wind
we
could
lie
securely
in
our
and
let
it
blow
the
arrangement
of
the
door
was
on
the
usual
sack
principle
which
is
now
recognized
as
the
only
serviceable
one
for
the
polar
regions
the
sack
patent
is
quite
simple
like
all
patents
that
are
any
good
you
cut
an
opening
in
the
tent
of
the
size
you
wish
then
you
take
a
sack
which
you
leave
open
at
both
ends
and
sew
one
end
fast
round
the
opening
of
the
tent
the
funnel
formed
by
the
open
sack
is
then
the
entrance
when
you
have
come
in
you
gather
up
the
open
end
of
the
funnel
or
sack
and
tie
it
together
not
a
particle
of
snow
can
get
into
a
tent
with
the
floor
sewed
on
and
an
entrance
of
this
kind
even
in
the
worst
storm
the
cases
for
sledging
provisions
were
made
of
fairly
thin
tough
ash
which
came
from
the
estate
of
palsgaard
in
jutland
and
the
material
did
all
it
promised
these
cases
were
foot
square
and
inches
high
they
had
only
a
little
round
opening
on
the
top
closed
with
an
aluminium
lid
which
fitted
exactly
like
the
lid
of
a
large
lids
weaken
the
cases
and
i
had
therefore
chosen
this
form
we
did
not
have
to
throw
off
the
lashing
of
the
case
to
get
the
lid
off
and
this
is
a
very
great
advantage
we
could
always
get
at
it
a
case
with
a
large
lid
covered
by
the
lashing
gives
constant
trouble
the
whole
lashing
has
to
be
undone
for
every
little
thing
one
wants
out
of
the
case
this
is
not
always
convenient
if
one
is
tired
and
slack
it
may
sometimes
happen
that
one
will
put
off
till
what
ought
to
be
done
especially
when
it
is
bitterly
cold
the
handier
one
sledging
outfit
the
sooner
one
gets
into
the
tent
and
to
rest
and
that
is
no
small
consideration
on
a
long
journey
our
outfit
of
clothing
was
abundant
and
more
complete
i
suppose
than
that
of
any
former
polar
expedition
we
may
divide
it
into
two
classes
the
outfit
for
specially
low
temperatures
and
that
for
more
moderate
temperatures
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
one
had
yet
wintered
on
the
barrier
so
we
had
to
be
prepared
for
anything
in
order
to
be
able
to
grapple
with
any
degree
of
cold
we
were
supplied
with
the
richest
assortment
of
clothing
we
had
it
specially
thick
medium
and
quite
light
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
these
skin
clothes
prepared
first
the
had
to
be
bought
in
a
raw
state
and
this
was
done
for
me
by
zappfe
at
tromso
karasjok
and
kaatokeino
let
me
take
the
opportunity
of
thanking
this
man
for
the
many
and
great
services
he
has
rendered
me
not
only
during
my
preparations
for
the
third
voyage
of
the
fram
but
in
the
fitting
out
of
the
gjoa
expedition
as
well
with
his
help
i
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
things
that
i
should
otherwise
never
have
been
able
to
get
he
shrank
from
no
amount
of
work
but
went
on
till
he
had
found
what
i
wanted
this
time
he
procured
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
good
dressed
by
the
lapps
and
sent
them
to
christiania
here
i
had
great
trouble
in
finding
a
man
who
could
sew
skins
but
at
last
i
found
one
we
then
went
to
work
to
make
clothes
after
the
pattern
of
the
netchelli
eskimo
and
the
sewing
went
on
early
and
late
thick
anoraks
and
thin
ones
heavy
breeches
and
light
winter
stockings
and
summer
stockings
we
also
had
a
dozen
thin
which
i
thought
of
using
inside
the
big
thick
ones
if
the
cold
should
be
too
severe
everything
was
finished
but
not
until
the
last
moment
the
outer
were
made
by
brandt
furrier
of
bergen
and
they
were
so
excellent
both
in
material
and
that
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
done
better
it
was
a
model
piece
of
work
to
save
this
outer
we
had
it
provided
with
a
cover
of
the
lightest
canvas
which
was
a
good
deal
longer
than
the
bag
itself
it
was
easy
to
tie
the
end
of
the
cover
together
like
the
mouth
of
the
sack
and
this
kept
the
snow
out
of
the
bag
during
the
day
march
in
this
way
we
always
kept
ourselves
free
from
the
annoyance
of
drifting
snow
we
attached
great
importance
to
having
the
bags
made
of
the
very
best
sort
of
skin
and
took
care
that
the
thin
skin
of
the
belly
was
removed
i
have
seen
of
the
finest
spoilt
in
a
comparatively
short
time
if
they
contained
a
few
patches
of
this
thin
skin
as
of
course
the
cold
penetrates
more
easily
through
the
thin
skin
and
gives
rise
to
dampness
in
the
form
of
rime
on
meeting
the
warmth
of
the
body
these
thin
patches
remain
damp
whenever
one
is
in
the
bag
and
in
a
short
time
they
lose
their
hair
the
damp
spreads
like
decay
in
wood
and
continually
attacks
the
surrounding
skin
with
the
result
that
one
fine
day
you
find
yourself
with
a
hairless
one
can
not
be
too
careful
in
the
choice
of
skins
for
the
sake
of
economy
the
makers
of
are
in
the
habit
of
sewing
them
in
such
a
way
that
the
direction
of
the
hair
is
towards
the
opening
of
the
bag
of
course
this
suits
the
shape
of
the
skins
best
but
it
does
not
suit
the
man
who
is
going
to
use
the
bag
for
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
crawl
into
a
which
is
only
just
wide
enough
to
allow
one
to
get
in
and
if
the
way
of
the
hair
is
against
one
it
is
doubly
difficult
i
had
them
all
made
as
bags
with
lacing
round
the
neck
this
did
not
of
course
meet
with
the
approval
of
all
as
will
be
seen
later
the
upper
part
of
this
thick
was
made
of
thinner
so
that
we
might
be
able
to
tie
it
closely
round
the
neck
the
thick
skin
will
not
draw
so
well
and
fit
so
closely
as
the
thin
our
clothing
in
moderate
temperatures
consisted
of
thick
woollen
underclothing
and
burberry
windproof
overalls
this
underclothing
was
specially
designed
for
the
purpose
i
had
myself
watched
the
preparation
of
the
material
and
knew
that
it
contained
nothing
but
pure
wool
we
had
overalls
of
two
different
materials
burberry
gabardine
and
the
ordinary
green
kind
that
is
used
in
norway
in
the
winter
for
sledge
journeys
where
one
has
to
save
weight
and
to
work
in
loose
easy
garments
i
must
unhesitatingly
recommend
burberry
it
is
extraordinarily
light
and
strong
and
keeps
the
wind
completely
out
for
hard
work
i
prefer
the
green
kind
it
keeps
out
the
wind
equally
well
but
is
heavier
and
more
bulky
and
less
comfortable
to
wear
on
a
long
march
our
burberry
were
made
in
the
form
of
anorak
blouse
and
trousers
both
very
roomy
the
others
consisted
of
trousers
and
jacket
with
hood
our
mits
were
for
the
most
part
such
as
one
can
buy
in
any
shop
we
wanted
nothing
else
in
and
around
winter
quarters
outside
the
mits
we
wore
an
outer
covering
of
windproof
material
so
as
not
to
wear
them
out
too
quickly
these
mits
are
not
very
strong
though
they
are
good
and
warm
besides
these
we
had
ten
pairs
of
ordinary
kid
mits
which
were
bought
at
a
in
christiania
and
were
practically
impossible
to
wear
out
i
wore
mine
from
framheim
to
the
pole
and
back
again
and
afterwards
on
the
voyage
to
tasmania
the
lining
of
course
was
torn
in
places
but
the
seams
of
the
mits
were
just
as
perfect
as
the
day
i
bought
them
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
i
went
on
ski
the
whole
way
and
used
two
poles
it
will
be
understood
that
the
mits
were
strongly
made
we
also
had
a
number
of
woollen
gloves
which
curiously
enough
the
others
greatly
prized
for
myself
i
was
never
able
to
wear
such
things
they
simply
freeze
the
fingers
off
me
but
most
important
of
all
is
the
covering
of
the
feet
for
the
feet
are
the
most
exposed
members
and
the
most
difficult
to
protect
one
can
look
after
the
hands
if
they
grow
cold
it
is
easy
to
beat
them
into
warmth
again
not
so
with
the
feet
they
are
covered
up
in
the
morning
and
this
is
a
sufficiently
troublesome
piece
of
work
to
make
one
disinclined
to
undo
it
again
until
one
is
turning
in
they
can
not
be
seen
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
one
has
to
depend
entirely
on
feeling
but
feeling
in
this
case
often
plays
curious
tricks
how
often
has
it
happened
that
men
have
had
their
feet
frozen
off
without
knowing
it
for
if
they
had
known
it
they
could
not
possibly
have
let
it
go
so
far
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
sensation
is
a
somewhat
doubtful
guide
for
the
feet
lose
all
sensation
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
transitional
stage
when
one
feels
the
cold
smarting
in
one
toes
and
tries
to
get
rid
of
it
by
stamping
the
feet
as
a
rule
this
is
successful
the
warmth
returns
or
the
circulation
is
restored
but
it
occasionally
happens
that
sensation
is
lost
at
the
very
moment
when
these
precautions
are
taken
and
then
one
must
be
an
old
hand
to
know
what
has
happened
many
men
conclude
that
as
they
no
longer
feel
the
unpleasant
smarting
sensation
all
is
well
and
at
the
evening
inspection
a
frozen
foot
of
appearance
presents
itself
an
event
of
this
kind
may
ruin
the
most
elaborately
prepared
enterprise
and
it
is
therefore
advisable
in
the
matter
of
feet
to
carry
one
caution
to
lengths
which
may
seem
ridiculous
now
it
is
a
fact
that
if
one
can
wear
soft
exclusively
the
risk
of
is
far
less
than
if
one
is
compelled
to
wear
stiff
boots
in
soft
of
course
the
foot
can
move
far
more
easily
and
keep
warm
but
we
were
to
take
ski
and
to
get
full
use
out
of
them
so
that
in
any
case
we
had
to
have
a
stiff
sole
for
the
sake
of
the
bindings
it
is
of
no
use
to
have
a
good
binding
unless
you
can
use
it
in
the
right
way
in
my
opinion
on
a
long
journey
such
as
that
we
had
before
us
the
ski
must
be
perfectly
steady
i
do
not
know
anything
that
tires
me
more
than
a
bad
fastening
that
is
one
that
allows
the
foot
to
shift
in
the
binding
i
want
the
ski
to
be
a
part
of
oneself
so
that
one
always
has
full
command
of
them
i
have
tried
many
patents
for
i
have
always
been
afraid
of
a
stiff
fastening
in
cold
temperatures
but
all
these
patents
without
exception
are
worthless
in
the
i
decided
this
time
to
try
a
combination
of
stiff
and
soft
so
that
we
could
use
the
splendid
ellefsen
bindings
but
this
was
no
easy
matter
of
our
whole
outfit
nothing
caused
me
more
worry
or
gave
us
all
more
work
in
the
course
of
the
expedition
than
the
stiff
outer
covering
which
we
had
to
have
but
we
solved
the
problem
at
last
i
applied
to
one
of
the
leading
makers
of
in
christiania
and
explained
the
difficulty
to
him
fortunately
i
had
found
a
man
who
was
evidently
interested
in
the
question
we
agreed
that
he
should
make
a
sample
pair
after
the
pattern
of
the
sole
was
to
be
thick
and
stiff
for
we
had
to
be
prepared
to
use
crampons
but
the
uppers
as
soft
as
possible
in
order
to
avoid
leather
which
usually
becomes
stiff
and
easily
cracked
in
the
cold
he
was
to
use
a
combination
of
leather
and
thin
canvas
for
the
uppers
leather
nearest
the
sole
and
canvas
above
it
the
measurements
were
taken
from
my
foot
which
is
not
exactly
a
child
foot
with
two
pairs
of
stockings
on
and
ten
pairs
were
made
i
well
remember
seeing
these
boots
in
civilized
christiania
they
were
exhibited
in
the
bootmaker
windows
i
used
to
go
a
long
way
round
to
avoid
coming
face
to
face
with
these
monsters
in
public
we
are
all
a
trifle
vain
and
dislike
having
our
own
shortcomings
shown
up
in
electric
light
if
i
had
ever
cherished
any
illusions
on
the
subject
of
a
dainty
little
foot
i
am
sure
the
last
trace
of
such
vanity
died
out
on
the
day
i
passed
the
window
and
beheld
my
own
boots
i
never
went
that
way
again
until
i
was
certain
that
the
exhibition
was
closed
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
boots
were
a
fine
piece
of
workmanship
we
shall
hear
later
on
of
the
alterations
they
had
to
undergo
before
we
at
last
made
them
as
large
as
we
wanted
for
the
giant
boots
turned
out
much
too
small
among
other
equipment
i
must
mention
our
excellent
primus
cooking
apparatus
this
all
came
complete
from
a
firm
in
stockholm
for
cooking
on
sledge
journeys
the
primus
stove
ranks
above
all
others
it
gives
a
great
deal
of
heat
uses
little
oil
and
requires
no
attention
advantages
which
are
important
enough
anywhere
but
especially
when
sledging
there
is
never
any
trouble
with
this
apparatus
it
has
come
as
near
perfection
as
possible
we
took
five
nansen
cookers
with
us
this
cooker
utilizes
the
heat
more
completely
than
any
other
but
i
have
one
objection
to
make
to
it
it
takes
up
space
we
used
it
on
our
depot
journeys
but
were
unfortunately
obliged
to
give
it
up
on
the
main
southern
journey
we
were
so
many
in
a
tent
and
space
was
so
limited
that
i
dared
not
risk
using
it
if
one
has
room
enough
it
is
ideal
in
my
opinion
we
had
with
us
ten
pairs
of
and
one
hundred
sets
of
of
the
alaska
eskimo
pattern
the
alaska
eskimo
drive
their
dogs
in
tandem
the
whole
pull
is
thus
straight
ahead
in
the
direction
the
sledge
is
going
and
this
is
undoubtedly
the
best
way
of
utilizing
the
power
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
adopt
the
same
system
in
sledging
on
the
barrier
another
great
advantage
it
had
was
that
the
dogs
would
pass
singly
across
fissures
so
that
the
danger
of
falling
through
was
considerably
reduced
the
exertion
of
pulling
is
also
less
trying
with
alaska
harness
than
with
the
greenland
kind
as
the
alaska
harness
has
a
shallow
padded
collar
which
is
slipped
over
the
animal
head
and
makes
the
weight
of
the
pull
come
on
his
shoulders
whereas
the
greenland
harness
presses
on
his
chest
raw
places
which
occur
rather
frequently
with
the
greenland
harness
are
almost
entirely
avoided
with
the
other
all
the
sets
of
harness
were
made
in
the
navy
workshops
and
after
their
long
and
hard
use
they
are
as
good
as
ever
there
could
be
no
better
recommendation
than
this
of
instruments
and
apparatus
for
the
sledge
journeys
we
carried
two
sextants
three
artificial
horizons
of
which
two
were
glass
horizons
with
dark
glasses
and
one
a
mercury
horizon
and
four
spirit
compasses
made
in
christiania
they
were
excellent
little
compasses
but
unfortunately
useless
in
cold
weather
that
is
to
say
when
the
temperature
went
below
at
this
point
the
liquid
froze
i
had
drawn
the
maker
attention
to
this
beforehand
and
asked
him
to
use
as
pure
a
spirit
as
possible
what
his
object
was
i
still
do
not
know
but
the
spirit
he
employed
was
highly
dilute
the
best
proof
of
this
was
that
the
liquid
in
our
compasses
froze
before
the
spirits
in
a
flask
we
were
naturally
inconvenienced
by
this
besides
these
we
had
an
ordinary
little
two
pairs
of
binoculars
one
by
zeiss
and
the
other
by
goertz
and
from
schanz
we
had
various
kinds
of
glasses
for
these
so
that
we
could
change
when
we
were
tired
of
one
colour
during
the
whole
stay
on
the
barrier
i
myself
wore
a
pair
of
ordinary
spectacles
with
yellow
glasses
of
quite
a
light
tint
these
are
prepared
by
a
chemical
process
in
such
a
way
that
they
nullify
the
harmful
colours
in
the
sun
rays
how
excellent
these
glasses
are
appears
clearly
enough
from
the
fact
that
i
never
had
the
slightest
touch
of
on
the
southern
journey
although
the
spectacles
were
perfectly
open
and
allowed
the
light
to
enter
freely
everywhere
it
will
perhaps
be
suggested
that
i
am
less
susceptible
to
this
ailment
than
others
but
i
know
from
personal
experience
that
such
is
not
the
case
i
have
previously
had
several
severe
attacks
of
we
had
two
photographic
cameras
an
air
thermometer
two
aneroids
with
altitude
scale
to
feet
and
two
hypsometers
the
hypsometer
is
only
an
instrument
for
determining
the
which
gives
one
the
height
above
the
sea
the
method
is
both
simple
and
reliable
the
medical
stores
for
sledging
were
given
by
a
london
firm
and
the
way
in
which
the
things
were
packed
speaks
for
the
whole
outfit
there
is
not
a
speck
of
rust
on
needles
scissors
knives
or
anything
else
although
they
have
been
exposed
to
much
damp
our
own
medical
outfit
which
was
bought
in
christiania
and
according
to
the
vendor
statement
unusually
well
packed
became
in
a
short
time
so
damaged
that
the
whole
of
it
is
now
entirely
spoilt
the
sledging
provisions
must
be
mentioned
briefly
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
pemmican
i
have
never
considered
it
necessary
to
take
a
whole
grocer
shop
with
me
when
sledging
the
food
should
be
simple
and
nourishing
and
that
is
enough
a
rich
and
varied
menu
is
for
people
who
have
no
work
to
do
besides
the
pemmican
we
had
biscuits
and
chocolate
the
biscuits
were
a
present
from
a
norwegian
factory
and
did
all
honour
to
their
origin
they
were
specially
baked
for
us
and
were
made
of
oatmeal
with
the
addition
of
dried
milk
and
a
little
sugar
they
were
extremely
nourishing
and
pleasant
to
the
taste
thanks
to
efficient
packing
they
kept
fresh
and
crisp
all
the
time
these
biscuits
formed
a
great
part
of
our
daily
diet
and
undoubtedly
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
the
successful
result
is
a
comparatively
new
commodity
with
us
but
it
deserves
to
be
better
known
it
came
from
the
district
of
jaederen
neither
heat
nor
cold
dryness
nor
wet
could
hurt
it
we
had
large
quantities
of
it
lying
out
in
small
thin
linen
bags
in
every
possible
state
of
the
weather
the
powder
was
as
good
the
last
day
as
the
first
we
also
took
dried
milk
from
a
firm
in
wisconsin
this
milk
had
an
addition
of
malt
and
sugar
and
was
in
my
opinion
excellent
it
also
kept
good
the
whole
time
the
chocolate
came
from
a
firm
and
was
beyond
all
praise
the
whole
supply
was
a
very
acceptable
gift
we
are
bringing
all
the
purveyors
of
our
sledging
provisions
samples
of
their
goods
that
have
made
the
journey
to
the
south
pole
and
back
in
gratitude
for
the
kind
assistance
they
afforded
us
chapter
iii
on
the
way
to
the
south
the
month
of
may
ran
its
course
beautiful
as
only
a
spring
month
in
norway
can
be
a
lovely
dream
of
verdure
and
flowers
but
unfortunately
we
had
little
time
to
admire
all
the
splendour
that
surrounded
us
our
watchword
was
away
away
from
beautiful
sights
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
beginning
of
the
month
the
fram
lay
moored
to
her
buoy
outside
the
old
walls
of
akershus
fresh
and
trim
she
came
from
the
yard
at
horten
you
could
see
the
shine
on
her
new
paint
a
long
way
off
involuntarily
one
thought
of
holidays
and
yachting
tours
at
the
sight
of
her
but
the
thought
was
soon
banished
the
first
day
after
her
arrival
the
vessel
deck
assumed
the
most
everyday
appearance
that
could
be
desired
the
loading
had
begun
a
long
procession
of
cases
of
provisions
made
its
way
unceasingly
from
the
basement
of
the
historical
museum
down
into
the
roomy
hold
of
the
fram
where
lieutenant
nilsen
and
the
three
nordlanders
were
ready
to
receive
them
this
process
was
not
an
altogether
simple
one
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
very
serious
affair
it
was
not
enough
to
know
that
all
the
cases
were
duly
on
board
the
problem
was
to
know
exactly
where
each
particular
case
was
placed
and
at
the
same
time
to
stow
them
all
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
easily
be
got
at
in
future
this
was
a
difficult
piece
of
work
and
it
was
not
rendered
any
more
easy
by
the
attention
that
had
to
be
paid
to
the
numerous
hatches
leading
down
into
the
lower
hold
where
the
big
petroleum
tanks
stood
all
these
hatches
had
to
be
left
accessible
otherwise
we
should
have
been
cut
off
from
pumping
the
oil
into
the
however
nilsen
and
his
assistants
accomplished
their
task
with
brilliant
success
among
the
hundreds
of
cases
there
was
not
one
that
was
misplaced
not
one
that
was
stowed
so
that
it
could
not
instantly
be
brought
into
the
light
of
day
while
the
provisioning
was
going
on
the
rest
of
the
equipment
was
also
being
taken
on
board
each
member
of
the
expedition
was
busily
engaged
in
looking
after
the
needs
of
his
own
department
in
the
best
way
possible
nor
was
this
a
question
of
trifles
one
may
cudgel
brains
endlessly
in
advance
but
some
new
requirement
will
constantly
be
cropping
up
until
one
puts
a
full
stop
to
it
by
casting
off
and
sailing
this
event
was
becoming
imminent
with
the
arrival
of
june
the
day
before
leaving
christiania
we
had
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
receiving
a
visit
from
the
king
and
queen
of
norway
on
board
the
fram
having
been
informed
beforehand
of
their
majesties
coming
we
endeavoured
as
far
as
possible
to
bring
some
order
into
the
chaos
that
reigned
on
board
i
do
not
know
that
we
were
particularly
successful
but
i
am
sure
that
every
one
of
the
fram
crew
will
always
remember
with
respectful
gratitude
king
haakon
cordial
words
of
farewell
on
the
same
occasion
the
expedition
received
from
their
majesties
the
gift
of
a
beautiful
silver
jug
which
afterwards
formed
the
most
handsome
ornament
of
our
table
on
every
festive
occasion
on
june
early
in
the
forenoon
the
fram
left
christiania
bound
at
first
for
my
home
on
bundefjord
the
object
of
her
call
there
was
to
take
on
board
the
house
for
the
winter
station
which
stood
ready
built
in
the
garden
our
excellent
carpenter
jorgen
stubberud
had
superintended
the
construction
of
this
strong
building
it
was
now
rapidly
taken
to
pieces
and
every
single
plank
and
beam
was
carefully
numbered
we
had
quite
an
imposing
pile
of
materials
to
get
aboard
where
even
before
there
was
not
much
room
to
spare
the
bulk
of
it
was
stowed
forward
and
the
remainder
in
the
hold
the
more
experienced
among
the
members
of
the
expedition
were
evidently
absorbed
in
profound
conjectures
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
observation
house
as
the
newspapers
had
christened
it
it
may
willingly
be
admitted
that
they
had
good
reason
for
their
speculations
by
an
observation
house
is
usually
meant
a
comparatively
simple
construction
sufficient
to
provide
the
necessary
shelter
from
wind
and
weather
our
house
on
the
other
hand
was
a
model
of
solidity
with
three
double
walls
double
roof
and
floor
its
arrangements
included
ten
inviting
bunks
a
kitchener
and
a
table
the
latter
moreover
had
a
cover
i
can
understand
that
they
want
to
keep
themselves
warm
when
they
making
observations
said
helmer
hanssen
but
what
they
want
with
a
cloth
on
the
table
i
ca
make
out
on
the
afternoon
of
june
it
was
announced
that
everything
was
ready
and
in
the
evening
we
all
assembled
at
a
simple
farewell
supper
in
the
garden
i
took
the
opportunity
of
wishing
good
luck
to
every
man
in
turn
and
finally
we
united
in
a
god
preserve
the
king
and
fatherland
then
we
broke
up
the
last
man
to
get
into
the
boat
was
the
second
in
command
he
arrived
armed
with
a
horseshoe
in
his
opinion
it
is
quite
incredible
what
luck
an
old
horseshoe
will
bring
possibly
he
is
right
anyhow
the
horseshoe
was
firmly
nailed
to
the
mast
in
the
fram
saloon
and
there
it
still
hangs
when
on
board
we
promptly
set
to
work
to
get
up
the
anchor
the
bolinder
motor
hummed
and
the
heavy
cable
rattled
in
through
the
precisely
at
midnight
the
anchor
let
go
of
the
bottom
and
just
as
the
seventh
of
june
rolled
in
over
us
the
fram
stood
out
of
christiania
fjord
for
the
third
time
twice
already
had
a
band
of
men
brought
this
ship
back
with
honour
after
years
of
service
would
it
be
vouchsafed
to
us
to
uphold
this
honourable
tradition
such
were
no
doubt
the
thoughts
with
which
most
of
us
were
occupied
as
our
vessel
glided
over
the
motionless
fjord
in
the
light
summer
night
the
start
was
made
under
the
sign
of
the
seventh
of
june
and
this
was
taken
as
a
promising
omen
but
among
our
bright
and
confident
hopes
there
crept
a
shadow
of
melancholy
the
hillsides
the
woods
the
fjord
all
were
so
bewitchingly
fair
and
so
dear
to
us
they
called
to
us
with
their
allurement
but
the
diesel
motor
knew
no
pity
its
went
on
brutally
through
the
stillness
a
little
boat
in
which
were
some
of
my
nearest
relations
dropped
gradually
astern
there
was
a
glimpse
of
white
handkerchiefs
in
the
twilight
and
then
farewell
the
next
morning
we
were
moored
in
the
inner
harbour
at
horten
an
apparently
innocent
lighter
came
alongside
at
once
but
the
cargo
was
not
quite
so
innocent
as
its
appearance
it
consisted
of
no
less
than
half
a
ton
of
and
rifle
ammunition
a
somewhat
unpleasant
but
none
the
less
necessary
item
of
our
equipment
besides
taking
on
board
the
ammunition
we
availed
ourselves
of
the
opportunity
of
completing
our
when
this
was
done
we
lost
no
time
in
getting
away
as
we
passed
the
warships
lying
in
the
harbour
they
manned
ship
and
the
bands
played
the
national
anthem
outside
vealos
we
had
the
pleasure
of
waving
a
last
farewell
to
a
man
to
whom
the
expedition
will
always
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
captain
christian
blom
superintendent
of
the
dockyard
who
had
supervised
the
extensive
repairs
to
the
fram
with
unrelaxing
interest
and
obligingness
he
slipped
past
us
in
his
i
do
not
remember
if
he
got
a
cheer
if
he
did
not
it
was
a
mistake
now
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
south
as
the
heading
of
this
chapter
announces
though
not
yet
in
earnest
we
had
an
additional
task
before
us
the
oceanographical
cruise
in
the
atlantic
this
necessitated
a
considerable
detour
on
the
way
the
scientific
results
of
this
cruise
will
be
dealt
with
by
specialists
in
due
course
if
it
is
briefly
referred
to
here
this
is
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
continuity
after
consultation
with
professor
nansen
the
plan
was
to
begin
investigations
in
the
region
to
the
south
of
ireland
and
thence
to
work
our
way
westward
as
far
as
time
and
circumstances
permitted
the
work
was
to
be
resumed
on
the
homeward
voyage
in
the
direction
of
the
north
of
scotland
for
various
reasons
this
programme
afterwards
had
to
be
considerably
reduced
for
the
first
few
days
after
leaving
norway
we
were
favoured
with
the
most
splendid
summer
weather
the
north
sea
was
as
calm
as
a
millpond
the
fram
had
little
more
motion
than
when
she
was
lying
in
bundefjord
this
was
all
the
better
for
us
as
we
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
absolutely
ready
for
sea
when
we
passed
faerder
and
came
into
the
capricious
skagerak
hard
pressed
as
we
had
been
for
time
it
had
not
been
possible
to
lash
and
stow
the
last
of
our
cargo
as
securely
as
was
desirable
a
stiff
breeze
at
the
mouth
of
the
fjord
would
therefore
have
been
rather
inconvenient
as
it
was
everything
was
arranged
admirably
but
to
do
this
we
had
to
work
night
and
day
i
have
been
told
that
on
former
occasions
made
fearful
ravages
on
board
the
fram
but
from
this
trial
we
also
had
an
easy
escape
nearly
all
the
members
of
the
expedition
were
used
to
the
sea
and
the
few
who
perhaps
were
not
so
entirely
proof
against
it
had
a
whole
week
of
fine
weather
to
get
into
training
so
far
as
i
know
not
a
single
case
occurred
of
this
unpleasant
and
justly
dreaded
complaint
after
passing
the
dogger
bank
we
had
a
very
welcome
breeze
with
the
help
of
the
sails
we
could
now
increase
the
not
very
reckless
speed
that
the
motor
was
capable
of
accomplishing
before
we
sailed
the
most
contradictory
accounts
were
current
of
the
fram
sailing
qualities
there
were
some
who
asserted
that
the
ship
could
not
be
got
through
the
water
at
all
while
with
equal
force
the
contrary
view
was
maintained
that
she
was
a
notable
fast
sailer
as
might
be
supposed
the
truth
as
usual
lay
about
between
these
two
extremes
the
ship
was
no
racer
nor
was
she
an
absolute
log
we
ran
before
the
wind
towards
the
english
channel
at
a
speed
of
about
seven
knots
and
with
that
we
were
satisfied
for
the
time
being
the
important
question
for
us
was
whether
we
should
keep
the
favourable
wind
till
we
were
well
through
the
straits
of
dover
and
preferably
a
good
way
down
channel
our
engine
power
was
far
too
limited
to
make
it
of
any
use
trying
to
go
against
the
wind
and
we
should
have
been
obliged
in
that
case
to
have
recourse
to
the
method
beating
tacking
in
the
english
channel
the
busiest
part
of
the
world
seas
is
in
itself
no
very
pleasant
work
for
us
it
would
be
so
much
the
worse
as
it
would
greatly
encroach
on
the
time
that
could
be
devoted
to
oceanographical
investigations
but
the
east
wind
held
with
praiseworthy
steadiness
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
we
were
through
the
channel
and
about
a
week
after
leaving
norway
we
were
able
to
take
the
first
oceanographical
station
at
the
point
arranged
according
to
the
plan
hitherto
everything
had
gone
as
smoothly
as
we
could
wish
but
now
for
a
change
difficulties
began
to
appear
first
in
the
form
of
unfavourable
weather
when
the
begins
to
blow
in
the
north
atlantic
it
is
generally
a
good
while
before
it
drops
again
and
this
time
it
did
not
belie
its
reputation
far
from
getting
to
the
westward
we
were
threatened
for
a
time
with
being
driven
on
to
the
irish
coast
it
was
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
but
we
soon
found
ourselves
obliged
to
shorten
the
route
originally
laid
down
very
considerably
a
contributing
cause
of
this
determination
was
the
fact
that
the
motor
was
out
of
order
whether
it
was
the
fault
of
the
oil
or
a
defect
in
the
engine
itself
our
engineer
was
not
clear
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
make
for
home
in
good
time
in
case
of
extensive
repairs
being
required
in
spite
of
these
difficulties
we
had
a
quite
respectable
collection
of
samples
of
water
and
temperatures
at
different
depths
before
we
set
our
course
for
norway
at
the
beginning
of
july
with
bergen
as
our
destination
during
the
passage
from
the
pentland
firth
we
had
a
violent
gale
from
the
north
which
gave
us
an
opportunity
of
experiencing
how
the
fram
behaved
in
bad
weather
the
trial
was
by
no
means
an
easy
one
it
was
blowing
a
gale
with
a
cross
sea
we
kept
going
practically
under
full
sail
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
our
ship
make
over
nine
knots
in
the
rather
severe
rolling
the
collar
of
the
mast
in
the
was
loosened
a
little
this
let
the
water
in
and
there
was
a
slight
flooding
of
lieutenant
nilsen
cabin
and
mine
the
others
whose
berths
were
to
port
were
on
the
weather
side
and
kept
dry
we
came
out
of
it
all
with
the
loss
of
a
few
boxes
of
cigars
which
were
wet
through
they
were
not
entirely
lost
for
all
that
ronne
took
charge
of
them
and
regaled
himself
with
salt
and
mouldy
cigars
for
six
months
afterwards
going
eight
or
nine
knots
an
hour
we
did
not
make
much
of
the
distance
between
scotland
and
norway
on
the
afternoon
of
saturday
july
the
wind
dropped
and
at
the
same
time
the
lookout
reported
land
in
sight
this
was
siggen
on
bommelo
in
the
course
of
the
night
we
came
under
the
coast
and
on
sunday
morning
july
we
ran
into
saelbjomsfjord
we
had
no
detailed
chart
of
this
inlet
but
after
making
a
great
noise
with
our
powerful
we
at
last
roused
the
inmates
of
the
and
a
pilot
came
aboard
he
showed
visible
signs
of
surprise
when
he
found
out
by
reading
the
name
on
the
ship
side
that
it
was
the
fram
he
had
before
him
lord
i
thought
you
were
a
russian
he
exclaimed
this
supposition
was
presumably
intended
to
serve
as
a
sort
of
excuse
for
his
small
hurry
in
coming
on
board
it
was
a
lovely
trip
through
the
fjords
to
bergen
as
warm
and
pleasant
in
here
as
it
had
been
bitter
and
cold
outside
we
had
a
dead
calm
all
day
and
with
the
four
knots
an
hour
which
was
all
the
motor
could
manage
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
we
anchored
off
the
naval
dockyard
in
solheimsvik
our
stay
in
bergen
happened
at
the
time
of
the
exhibition
and
the
committee
paid
the
expedition
the
compliment
of
giving
all
its
members
free
passes
business
of
one
kind
and
another
compelled
me
to
go
to
christiania
leaving
the
fram
in
charge
of
lieutenant
nilsen
they
had
their
hands
more
than
full
on
board
diesel
firm
in
stockholm
sent
their
experienced
fitter
aspelund
who
at
once
set
to
work
to
overhaul
the
motor
thoroughly
the
work
that
had
to
be
done
was
executed
gratis
by
the
laxevaag
engineering
works
after
going
into
the
matter
thoroughly
it
was
decided
to
change
the
solar
oil
we
had
on
board
for
refined
petroleum
through
the
courtesy
of
the
west
of
norway
petroleum
company
we
got
this
done
on
very
favourable
terms
at
the
storage
dock
in
skaalevik
this
was
troublesome
work
but
it
paid
in
the
future
the
samples
of
water
from
our
trip
were
taken
to
the
biological
station
where
kutschin
at
once
went
to
work
with
the
filtering
determination
of
the
proportion
of
chlorine
our
german
shipmate
the
oceanographer
schroer
left
us
at
bergen
on
july
the
fram
left
bergen
and
arrived
on
the
following
day
at
christiansand
where
i
met
her
here
we
again
had
a
series
of
busy
days
in
one
of
the
warehouses
were
piled
a
quantity
of
things
that
had
to
go
on
board
no
less
than
bundles
of
dried
fish
all
our
ski
and
sledging
outfit
a
of
timber
etc
at
fredriksholm
out
on
flekkero
we
had
found
room
for
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
the
passengers
the
eskimo
dogs
which
had
arrived
from
greenland
in
the
middle
of
july
on
the
steamer
hans
egede
the
ship
had
had
a
rather
long
and
rough
passage
and
the
dogs
were
not
in
very
good
condition
on
their
arrival
but
they
had
not
been
many
days
on
the
island
under
the
supervision
of
hassel
and
lindstrom
before
they
were
again
in
full
vigour
a
plentiful
supply
of
fresh
meat
worked
wonders
the
usually
peaceful
island
with
the
remains
of
the
old
fortress
resounded
day
by
day
and
sometimes
at
night
with
the
most
glorious
concerts
of
howling
these
musical
performances
attracted
a
number
of
inquisitive
visitors
who
were
anxious
to
submit
the
members
of
the
chorus
to
a
closer
examination
and
therefore
at
certain
times
the
public
were
admitted
to
see
the
animals
it
soon
turned
out
that
the
majority
of
the
dogs
far
from
being
ferocious
or
shy
were
on
the
contrary
very
appreciative
of
these
visits
they
sometimes
came
in
for
an
extra
in
the
form
of
a
sandwich
or
something
of
the
sort
besides
which
it
was
a
little
diversion
in
their
life
of
captivity
so
uncongenial
to
an
arctic
dog
for
every
one
of
them
was
securely
chained
up
this
was
necessary
especially
to
prevent
fighting
among
themselves
it
happened
not
infrequently
that
one
or
more
of
them
got
loose
but
the
two
guardians
were
always
ready
to
capture
the
runaways
one
enterprising
rascal
started
to
swim
over
the
sound
to
the
nearest
land
the
object
of
his
expedition
was
undoubtedly
certain
unsuspecting
sheep
that
were
grazing
by
the
shore
but
his
swim
was
interrupted
in
time
after
the
fram
arrival
wisting
took
over
the
position
of
in
hassel
place
he
and
lindstrom
stayed
close
to
the
island
where
the
dogs
were
wisting
had
a
way
of
his
own
with
his
subjects
and
was
soon
on
a
confidential
footing
with
them
he
also
showed
himself
to
be
possessed
of
considerable
veterinary
skill
an
exceedingly
useful
qualification
in
this
case
where
there
was
often
some
injury
or
other
to
be
attended
to
as
i
have
already
mentioned
up
to
this
time
no
member
of
the
expedition
except
lieutenant
nilsen
knew
anything
of
the
extension
of
plan
that
had
been
made
therefore
amongst
the
things
that
came
on
board
and
amongst
the
preparations
that
were
made
during
our
stay
at
christiansand
there
must
have
been
a
great
deal
that
appeared
very
strange
to
those
who
for
the
present
were
only
looking
forward
to
a
voyage
round
cape
horn
to
san
francisco
what
was
the
object
of
taking
all
these
dogs
on
board
and
transporting
them
all
that
long
way
and
if
it
came
to
that
would
any
of
them
survive
the
voyage
round
the
formidable
promontory
besides
were
there
not
dogs
enough
and
good
dogs
too
in
alaska
why
was
the
whole
full
of
coal
what
was
the
use
of
all
these
planks
and
boards
would
it
not
have
been
much
more
convenient
to
take
all
that
kind
of
goods
on
board
in
these
and
many
similar
questions
began
to
pass
from
man
to
man
indeed
their
very
faces
began
to
resemble
notes
of
interrogation
not
that
anyone
asked
me
far
from
it
it
was
the
second
in
command
who
had
to
bear
the
brunt
and
answer
as
well
as
he
could
an
extremely
thankless
and
unpleasant
task
for
a
man
who
already
had
his
hands
more
than
full
in
order
to
relieve
his
difficult
situation
i
resolved
shortly
before
leaving
christiansand
to
inform
lieutenants
prestrud
and
gjertsen
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
after
having
signed
an
undertaking
of
secrecy
they
received
full
information
of
the
intended
dash
to
the
south
pole
and
an
explanation
of
the
reasons
for
keeping
the
whole
thing
secret
when
asked
whether
they
wished
to
take
part
in
the
new
plan
they
both
answered
at
once
in
the
affirmative
and
that
settled
it
there
were
now
three
men
on
board
all
the
officers
who
were
acquainted
with
the
situation
and
were
thus
in
a
position
to
parry
troublesome
questions
and
remove
possible
anxieties
on
the
part
of
the
uninitiated
two
of
the
members
of
the
expedition
joined
during
the
stay
at
christiansand
hassel
and
lindstrom
and
one
change
was
made
the
engineer
eliassen
was
discharged
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
find
a
man
who
possessed
the
qualifications
for
taking
over
the
post
of
engineer
to
the
fram
few
or
perhaps
no
one
in
norway
could
be
expected
to
have
much
knowledge
of
motors
of
the
size
of
ours
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
go
to
the
place
where
the
engine
was
built
to
sweden
diesel
firm
in
stockholm
helped
us
out
of
the
difficulty
they
sent
us
the
man
and
it
afterwards
turned
out
that
he
was
the
right
man
knut
sundbeck
was
his
name
a
chapter
might
be
written
on
the
good
work
that
man
did
and
the
quiet
unostentatious
way
in
which
he
did
it
from
the
very
beginning
he
had
assisted
in
the
construction
of
the
fram
motor
so
that
he
knew
his
engine
thoroughly
he
treated
it
as
his
darling
therefore
there
was
never
anything
the
matter
with
it
it
may
truly
be
said
that
he
did
honour
to
his
firm
and
the
nation
to
which
he
belongs
meanwhile
we
were
hard
at
work
getting
ready
to
sail
we
decided
to
leave
before
the
middle
of
august
the
sooner
the
better
the
fram
had
been
in
dry
dock
where
the
hull
was
thoroughly
coated
with
composition
heavily
laden
as
the
ship
was
the
false
keel
was
a
good
deal
injured
by
the
severe
pressure
on
the
blocks
but
with
the
help
of
a
diver
the
damage
was
quickly
made
good
the
many
hundred
bundles
of
dried
fish
were
squeezed
into
the
main
hold
full
as
it
was
all
sledging
and
ski
outfit
was
carefully
stowed
away
so
as
to
be
protected
as
far
as
possible
from
damp
these
things
had
to
be
kept
dry
otherwise
they
would
become
warped
and
useless
bjaaland
had
charge
of
this
outfit
and
he
knew
how
it
should
be
treated
as
is
right
and
proper
when
all
the
goods
had
been
shipped
it
was
the
turn
of
the
passengers
the
fram
was
anchored
off
fredriksholm
and
the
necessary
preparations
were
immediately
made
for
receiving
our
friends
under
the
expert
direction
of
bjaaland
and
stubberud
as
many
as
possible
of
the
crew
were
set
to
work
with
axe
and
saw
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
the
fram
had
got
a
new
deck
this
consisted
of
loose
pieces
of
decking
which
could
easily
be
raised
and
removed
for
flushing
and
cleaning
this
false
deck
rested
on
planks
nailed
to
the
ship
deck
between
the
latter
and
the
loose
deck
there
was
therefore
a
considerable
space
the
object
of
which
was
a
double
one
namely
to
let
the
water
which
would
unavoidably
be
shipped
on
such
a
voyage
run
off
rapidly
and
to
allow
air
to
circulate
and
thus
keep
the
space
below
the
animals
as
cool
as
possible
the
arrangement
afterwards
proved
very
successful
the
bulwarks
on
the
of
the
fram
deck
consisted
of
an
iron
railing
covered
with
in
order
to
provide
both
shade
and
shelter
from
the
wind
a
lining
of
boards
was
now
put
up
along
the
inside
of
the
railing
and
chains
were
fastened
in
all
possible
and
impossible
places
to
tie
the
dogs
up
to
there
could
be
no
question
of
letting
them
go
loose
to
begin
with
at
any
rate
possibly
we
might
hope
to
be
able
to
set
them
free
later
on
when
they
knew
their
masters
better
and
were
more
familiar
with
their
surroundings
generally
late
in
the
afternoon
of
august
we
were
ready
to
receive
our
new
shipmates
and
they
were
conveyed
across
from
the
island
in
a
big
lighter
twenty
at
a
time
wisting
and
lindstrom
superintended
the
work
of
transport
and
maintained
order
capitally
they
had
succeeded
in
gaining
the
dogs
confidence
and
at
the
same
time
their
complete
respect
just
what
was
wanted
in
fact
at
the
fram
gangway
the
dogs
came
in
for
an
active
and
determined
reception
and
before
they
had
recovered
from
their
surprise
and
fright
they
were
securely
fastened
on
deck
and
given
to
understand
with
all
politeness
that
the
best
thing
they
could
do
for
the
time
being
was
to
accept
the
situation
with
calmness
the
whole
proceeding
went
so
rapidly
that
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
we
had
all
the
dogs
on
board
and
had
found
room
for
them
but
it
must
be
added
that
the
fram
deck
was
utilized
to
the
utmost
we
had
thought
we
should
be
able
to
keep
the
bridge
free
but
this
could
not
be
done
if
we
were
to
take
them
all
with
us
the
last
fourteen
in
number
had
to
be
accommodated
there
all
that
was
left
was
a
little
free
space
for
the
man
at
the
wheel
as
for
the
officer
of
the
watch
it
looked
as
if
he
would
be
badly
off
for
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
kill
time
by
standing
in
one
spot
through
the
whole
watch
but
just
then
there
was
no
time
for
small
troubles
of
this
sort
no
sooner
was
the
last
dog
on
board
than
we
set
about
putting
all
visitors
ashore
and
then
the
motor
began
working
the
windlass
under
the
forecastle
the
anchor
up
full
speed
ahead
and
the
voyage
towards
our
goal
miles
away
was
begun
quietly
and
unobserved
we
went
out
of
the
fjord
at
dusk
a
few
of
our
friends
accompanied
us
out
after
the
pilot
had
left
us
outside
flekkero
it
was
not
long
before
the
darkness
of
the
august
evening
hid
the
outlines
of
the
country
from
our
view
but
oxo
and
ryvingen
flashed
their
farewells
to
us
all
through
the
night
we
had
been
lucky
with
wind
and
weather
at
the
commencement
of
our
atlantic
cruise
in
the
early
summer
this
time
we
were
if
possible
even
more
favoured
it
was
perfectly
calm
when
we
sailed
and
the
north
sea
lay
perfectly
calm
for
several
days
after
what
we
had
to
do
now
was
to
become
familiar
with
and
used
to
all
these
dogs
and
this
was
enormously
facilitated
by
the
fact
that
for
the
first
week
we
experienced
nothing
but
fine
weather
before
we
sailed
there
was
no
lack
of
all
kinds
of
prophecies
of
the
evil
that
would
befall
us
with
our
dogs
we
heard
a
number
of
these
predictions
presumably
a
great
many
more
were
whispered
about
but
did
not
reach
our
ears
the
unfortunate
beasts
were
to
fare
terribly
badly
the
heat
of
the
tropics
would
make
short
work
of
the
greater
part
of
them
if
any
were
left
they
would
have
but
a
miserable
respite
before
being
washed
overboard
or
drowned
in
the
seas
that
would
come
on
deck
in
the
west
wind
belt
to
keep
them
alive
with
a
few
bits
of
dried
fish
was
an
impossibility
etc
as
everyone
knows
all
these
predictions
were
very
far
from
being
fulfilled
the
exact
opposite
happened
since
then
i
expect
most
of
us
who
made
the
trip
have
been
asked
the
question
was
not
that
voyage
to
the
south
an
excessively
wearisome
and
tedious
business
you
get
sick
of
all
those
dogs
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
keep
them
alive
it
goes
without
saying
that
a
five
months
voyage
in
such
waters
as
we
were
navigating
must
necessarily
present
a
good
deal
of
monotony
how
much
will
depend
on
what
resources
one
has
for
providing
occupation
in
this
respect
we
had
in
these
very
dogs
just
what
was
wanted
no
doubt
it
was
work
that
very
often
called
for
the
exercise
of
patience
nevertheless
like
any
other
work
it
furnished
diversion
and
amusement
and
so
much
the
more
since
we
here
had
to
deal
with
living
creatures
that
had
sense
enough
fully
to
appreciate
and
reciprocate
in
their
own
way
any
advance
that
was
made
to
them
from
the
very
first
i
tried
in
every
way
to
insist
upon
the
paramount
importance
to
our
whole
enterprise
of
getting
our
draught
animals
successfully
conveyed
to
our
destination
if
we
had
any
watchword
at
this
time
it
was
dogs
first
and
dogs
all
the
time
the
result
speaks
best
for
the
way
in
which
this
watchword
was
followed
the
following
was
the
arrangement
we
made
the
dogs
who
at
first
were
always
tied
up
on
the
same
spot
were
divided
into
parties
of
ten
to
each
party
one
or
two
keepers
were
assigned
with
full
responsibility
for
their
animals
and
their
treatment
for
my
own
share
i
took
the
fourteen
that
lived
on
the
bridge
feeding
the
animals
was
a
manoeuvre
that
required
the
presence
of
all
hands
on
deck
it
therefore
took
place
when
the
watch
was
changed
the
arctic
dog
greatest
enjoyment
in
life
is
putting
away
his
food
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
the
way
to
his
heart
lies
through
his
dish
of
meat
we
acted
on
this
principle
and
the
result
did
not
disappoint
us
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
the
different
squads
were
the
best
of
friends
with
their
respective
keepers
as
may
be
supposed
it
was
not
altogether
to
the
taste
of
the
dogs
to
stand
chained
up
all
the
time
their
temperament
is
far
too
lively
for
that
we
would
gladly
have
allowed
them
the
pleasure
of
running
about
and
thus
getting
healthy
exercise
but
for
the
present
we
dared
not
run
the
risk
of
letting
the
whole
pack
loose
a
little
more
education
was
required
first
it
was
easy
enough
to
win
their
affection
to
provide
them
with
a
good
education
was
of
course
a
more
difficult
matter
it
was
quite
touching
to
see
their
joy
and
gratitude
when
one
gave
up
a
little
time
to
their
entertainment
one
first
meeting
with
them
in
the
morning
was
specially
cordial
their
feelings
were
then
apt
to
find
vent
in
a
chorus
of
joyful
howls
this
was
called
forth
by
the
very
sight
of
their
masters
but
they
asked
more
than
that
they
were
not
satisfied
until
we
had
gone
round
patting
and
talking
to
every
one
if
by
chance
one
was
so
careless
as
to
miss
a
dog
he
at
once
showed
the
most
unmistakable
signs
of
disappointment
there
can
hardly
be
an
animal
that
is
capable
of
expressing
its
feelings
to
the
same
extent
as
the
dog
joy
sorrow
gratitude
scruples
of
conscience
are
all
reflected
as
plainly
as
could
be
desired
in
his
behaviour
and
above
all
in
his
eyes
we
human
beings
are
apt
to
cherish
the
conviction
that
we
have
a
monopoly
of
what
is
called
a
living
soul
the
eyes
it
is
said
are
the
mirror
of
this
soul
that
is
all
right
enough
but
now
take
a
look
at
a
dog
eyes
study
them
attentively
how
often
do
we
see
something
human
in
their
expression
the
same
variations
that
we
meet
with
in
human
eyes
this
at
all
events
is
something
that
strikingly
resembles
soul
we
will
leave
the
question
open
for
those
who
are
interested
in
its
solution
and
will
here
only
mention
another
point
which
seems
to
show
that
a
dog
is
something
more
than
a
mere
machine
of
flesh
and
blood
his
pronounced
individuality
there
were
about
a
hundred
dogs
on
board
the
fram
gradually
as
we
got
to
know
each
one
of
them
by
daily
intercourse
they
each
revealed
some
characteristic
trait
some
peculiarity
hardly
two
of
them
were
alike
either
in
disposition
or
in
appearance
to
an
observant
eye
there
was
here
ample
opportunity
for
the
most
amusing
exercise
if
now
and
then
one
grew
a
little
tired
of
one
which
i
must
admit
seldom
happened
there
was
as
a
rule
diversion
to
be
found
in
the
society
of
the
animals
i
say
as
a
rule
there
were
of
course
exceptions
it
was
not
an
unmixed
pleasure
having
the
whole
deck
full
of
dogs
for
all
those
months
our
patience
was
severely
tested
many
a
time
but
in
spite
of
all
the
trouble
and
inconvenience
to
which
the
transport
of
the
dogs
necessarily
gave
rise
i
am
certainly
right
in
saying
that
these
months
of
sea
voyage
would
have
seemed
far
more
monotonous
and
tedious
if
we
had
been
without
our
passengers
during
the
first
four
or
five
days
we
had
now
been
making
our
way
towards
the
straits
of
dover
and
the
hope
began
to
dawn
within
us
that
this
time
as
last
we
should
slip
through
without
any
great
difficulty
there
had
been
five
days
of
absolute
calm
why
should
it
not
last
out
the
week
but
it
did
not
as
we
passed
the
lightship
at
the
western
end
of
the
goodwins
the
fine
weather
left
us
and
in
its
place
came
the
wind
with
rain
fog
and
foul
weather
in
its
train
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
it
became
so
thick
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
two
or
three
ship
lengths
ahead
but
if
we
could
see
nothing
we
heard
all
the
more
the
ceaseless
shrieks
of
many
and
sirens
told
us
only
too
plainly
what
a
crowd
of
vessels
we
were
in
it
was
not
exactly
a
pleasant
situation
our
excellent
ship
had
many
good
points
but
they
did
not
prevent
her
being
extraordinarily
slow
and
awkward
in
turning
this
is
an
element
of
great
danger
in
these
waters
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
possible
accident
whether
our
own
fault
or
not
would
to
us
be
absolutely
fatal
we
had
so
little
time
to
spare
that
the
resulting
delay
might
ruin
the
whole
enterprise
an
ordinary
trading
vessel
can
take
the
risk
by
careful
manoeuvring
a
skipper
can
almost
always
keep
out
of
the
way
collisions
are
as
a
rule
the
result
of
rashness
or
carelessness
on
one
side
or
the
other
the
rash
one
has
to
pay
the
careful
one
may
perhaps
make
money
out
of
it
carefulness
on
our
part
was
a
matter
of
course
it
would
have
been
a
poor
consolation
to
us
if
another
ship
had
had
to
pay
for
her
carelessness
we
could
not
take
that
risk
therefore
little
as
we
liked
doing
so
we
put
into
the
downs
and
anchored
there
right
opposite
to
us
we
had
the
town
of
deal
then
in
the
height
of
its
season
the
only
amusement
we
had
was
to
observe
all
these
apparently
unconcerned
people
who
passed
their
time
in
bathing
or
walking
about
the
white
inviting
sands
they
had
no
need
to
worry
themselves
much
about
what
quarter
the
wind
blew
from
our
only
wish
was
that
it
would
veer
or
in
any
case
drop
our
communication
with
the
land
was
limited
to
sending
ashore
telegrams
and
letters
for
home
by
the
next
morning
our
patience
was
already
quite
exhausted
but
not
so
with
the
it
kept
going
as
steadily
as
ever
but
it
was
clear
weather
and
therefore
we
decided
at
once
to
make
an
attempt
to
get
to
the
west
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
have
recourse
to
the
ancient
method
of
beating
we
cleared
one
point
and
then
another
but
more
than
that
we
could
not
manage
for
the
time
being
we
took
one
bearing
after
another
no
there
was
no
visible
progress
off
dungeness
we
had
to
anchor
again
and
once
more
console
ourselves
with
the
balm
of
patience
this
time
we
escaped
with
passing
the
night
there
the
wind
now
thought
fit
to
veer
sufficiently
to
let
us
get
out
at
daybreak
but
it
was
still
a
contrary
wind
and
we
had
to
beat
almost
all
the
way
down
the
english
channel
a
whole
week
was
spent
in
doing
these
three
hundred
miles
that
was
rather
hard
considering
the
distance
we
had
to
go
i
fancy
most
of
us
gave
a
good
sigh
of
relief
when
at
last
we
were
clear
of
the
scilly
isles
the
everlasting
wind
was
still
blowing
but
that
did
not
matter
so
much
now
the
main
thing
was
that
we
found
ourselves
in
open
sea
with
the
whole
atlantic
before
us
perhaps
one
must
have
sailed
in
the
fram
to
be
able
fully
to
understand
what
a
blessing
it
was
to
feel
ourselves
altogether
clear
of
the
surrounding
land
and
the
many
in
the
channel
to
say
nothing
of
constantly
working
the
ship
with
a
deck
swarming
with
dogs
on
our
first
voyage
through
the
channel
in
june
we
had
caught
two
or
three
carrier
pigeons
which
had
come
to
rest
in
the
rigging
utterly
tired
out
on
the
approach
of
darkness
we
were
able
to
get
hold
of
them
without
difficulty
their
numbers
and
marks
were
noted
and
after
they
had
been
taken
care
of
for
a
couple
of
days
and
had
recovered
their
strength
we
let
them
go
they
circled
once
or
twice
round
the
and
then
made
for
the
english
coast
i
think
this
episode
led
to
our
taking
a
few
carrier
pigeons
with
us
when
we
left
christiansand
lieutenant
nilsen
as
a
former
owner
of
pigeons
was
to
take
charge
of
them
then
a
nice
house
was
made
for
them
and
the
pigeons
lived
happily
in
their
new
abode
on
the
top
of
the
amidships
now
in
some
way
or
other
the
second
in
command
found
out
that
the
circulation
of
air
in
the
was
faulty
to
remedy
this
defect
he
one
day
set
the
door
a
little
ajar
air
certainly
got
into
the
house
but
the
pigeons
came
out
a
joker
on
discovering
that
the
birds
had
flown
wrote
up
to
let
in
big
letters
on
the
wall
of
the
the
second
in
command
was
not
in
a
very
gentle
frame
of
mind
that
day
as
far
as
i
know
this
escape
took
place
in
the
channel
the
pigeons
found
their
way
home
to
norway
the
bay
of
biscay
has
a
bad
name
among
seamen
and
it
fully
deserves
it
that
tempestuous
corner
of
the
sea
conceals
for
ever
in
its
depths
so
many
a
stout
ship
and
her
crew
we
for
our
part
however
had
good
hopes
of
escaping
unharmed
considering
the
time
of
year
and
our
hopes
were
fulfilled
we
had
better
luck
than
we
dared
to
anticipate
our
stubborn
opponent
the
wind
got
tired
at
last
of
trying
to
stop
our
progress
it
was
no
use
we
went
slowly
it
was
true
but
still
we
got
along
of
the
meteorological
lessons
of
our
youth
we
especially
recalled
at
that
moment
the
frequent
northerly
winds
off
the
coast
of
portugal
and
as
a
pleasant
surprise
we
already
had
them
far
up
in
the
bay
this
was
an
agreeable
change
after
all
our
tacking
in
the
channel
the
north
wind
held
almost
as
bravely
as
the
had
done
before
and
at
what
was
to
our
ideas
quite
a
respectable
rate
we
went
southward
day
after
day
towards
the
zone
where
we
could
be
sure
of
a
fair
wind
and
where
a
sailor
life
is
as
a
rule
a
pleasant
one
for
that
matter
as
far
as
seamanship
was
concerned
our
work
had
gone
on
smoothly
enough
even
during
these
first
difficult
weeks
there
were
always
willing
and
practised
hands
enough
for
what
was
wanted
even
though
the
work
to
be
done
was
frequently
of
a
not
very
pleasant
kind
take
washing
decks
for
instance
every
seaman
will
have
something
to
say
about
what
this
is
like
on
board
ships
that
carry
live
animals
especially
when
these
are
carried
on
deck
in
the
way
of
all
work
that
has
to
be
done
i
have
always
held
the
opinion
that
a
polar
ship
ought
not
any
more
than
any
other
vessel
to
be
a
wholesale
establishment
for
dirt
and
filth
however
many
dogs
there
may
be
on
board
on
the
contrary
i
should
say
that
on
voyages
of
this
kind
it
is
more
than
ever
vitally
necessary
to
keep
surroundings
as
clean
and
sweet
as
possible
the
important
thing
is
to
get
rid
of
anything
that
may
have
a
demoralizing
and
depressing
effect
the
influence
of
uncleanliness
in
this
way
is
so
well
known
that
it
is
needless
to
preach
about
it
here
my
views
were
shared
by
everyone
on
board
the
fram
and
everything
was
done
to
act
in
accordance
with
them
in
spite
of
what
may
be
considered
great
difficulties
twice
a
day
the
whole
deck
was
thoroughly
washed
down
besides
all
the
extra
turns
at
odd
times
with
bucket
and
scrubber
at
least
once
a
week
the
whole
of
the
loose
deck
was
taken
up
and
each
separate
part
of
it
thoroughly
washed
until
it
was
as
clean
as
when
it
was
laid
down
at
christiansand
this
was
a
labour
that
required
great
patience
and
perseverance
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
to
perform
it
but
i
never
saw
any
shortcomings
just
see
and
get
it
clean
they
said
at
night
when
it
was
not
always
easy
to
see
what
one
was
doing
it
might
often
happen
that
one
heard
some
more
or
less
heated
exclamations
from
those
who
had
to
handle
coils
of
rope
in
working
the
ship
i
need
not
hint
more
explicitly
at
the
cause
of
them
if
it
is
remembered
that
there
were
dogs
lying
about
everywhere
who
had
eaten
and
drunk
well
in
the
course
of
the
day
but
after
a
time
the
oaths
gave
way
to
jokes
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
custom
does
not
help
us
to
get
over
it
is
the
universal
practice
on
board
ship
to
divide
the
day
and
night
into
watches
of
four
hours
the
two
watches
into
which
the
crew
is
divided
relieve
each
other
every
four
hours
but
on
vessels
that
sail
to
the
arctic
ocean
it
is
customary
to
have
watches
of
six
hours
we
adopted
the
latter
plan
which
on
its
being
put
to
the
vote
proved
to
have
a
compact
majority
in
its
favour
by
this
arrangement
of
watches
we
only
had
to
turn
out
twice
in
the
course
of
hours
and
the
watch
below
had
had
a
proper
sleep
whenever
it
turned
out
if
one
has
to
eat
smoke
and
perhaps
chat
a
little
during
four
hours
watch
below
it
does
not
leave
much
time
for
sleeping
and
if
there
should
be
a
call
for
all
hands
on
deck
it
means
no
sleep
at
all
to
cope
with
the
work
of
the
we
had
from
the
beginning
the
two
engineers
sundbeck
and
nodtvedt
they
took
watch
and
watch
four
hours
each
when
the
motor
was
in
use
for
a
long
time
continuously
this
was
a
rather
severe
duty
and
on
the
whole
it
was
just
as
well
to
have
a
man
in
reserve
i
therefore
decided
to
have
a
third
man
trained
as
reserve
engineer
kristensen
applied
for
this
post
and
it
may
be
said
in
his
praise
that
he
accomplished
the
change
remarkably
well
thorough
as
he
was
there
might
have
been
reason
to
fear
that
he
would
repent
of
the
transfer
but
no
he
quickly
became
life
and
soul
an
engineer
this
did
not
prevent
our
seeing
him
on
deck
again
many
a
time
during
the
passage
through
the
west
wind
belt
when
there
was
need
of
a
good
man
during
a
gale
the
motor
which
during
the
atlantic
cruise
had
been
a
constant
source
of
uneasiness
and
anxiety
regained
our
entire
confidence
under
sundbeck
capable
command
it
hummed
so
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
it
to
judge
from
the
sound
of
the
one
would
have
thought
the
fram
was
moving
through
the
water
with
the
speed
of
a
if
this
was
not
the
case
the
engine
was
not
to
blame
possibly
the
screw
had
a
share
of
it
the
latter
ought
probably
to
have
been
somewhat
larger
though
experts
are
not
agreed
about
this
in
any
case
there
was
something
radically
wrong
with
our
propeller
whenever
there
was
a
little
seaway
it
was
apt
to
work
loose
in
the
brasses
this
disadvantage
is
of
very
common
occurrence
in
vessels
which
have
to
be
fitted
with
lifting
propellers
on
account
of
the
ice
and
we
did
not
escape
it
the
only
remedy
was
to
lift
the
whole
and
renew
the
brasses
an
extremely
difficult
work
when
it
had
to
be
done
in
the
open
sea
and
on
as
lively
a
ship
as
the
fram
day
by
day
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
how
the
dogs
found
themselves
more
and
more
at
home
on
board
perhaps
even
among
ourselves
there
were
one
or
two
who
had
felt
some
doubt
at
first
of
what
the
solution
of
the
dog
question
would
be
but
in
any
case
all
such
doubts
were
soon
swept
away
even
at
an
early
stage
of
the
voyage
we
had
every
reason
to
hope
that
we
should
land
our
animals
safe
and
sound
what
we
had
to
see
to
in
the
first
place
was
to
let
them
have
as
much
and
as
good
food
as
circumstances
permitted
as
already
mentioned
we
had
provided
ourselves
with
dried
fish
for
their
consumption
eskimo
dogs
do
not
suffer
very
greatly
from
daintiness
but
an
exclusive
diet
of
dried
fish
would
seem
rather
monotonous
in
the
even
to
their
appetites
and
a
certain
addition
of
fatty
substances
was
necessary
otherwise
we
should
have
some
trouble
with
them
we
had
on
board
several
great
barrels
of
tallow
or
fat
but
our
store
was
not
so
large
that
we
did
not
have
to
economize
in
order
to
make
the
supply
of
fat
last
and
at
the
same
time
to
induce
our
boarders
to
take
as
much
dried
fish
as
possible
we
invented
a
mixture
which
was
called
by
a
sailor
term
daenge
this
must
not
be
confused
with
thrashing
which
was
also
served
out
liberally
from
time
to
time
but
the
daenge
was
more
in
demand
it
consisted
of
a
mixture
of
fish
tallow
and
all
boiled
together
into
a
sort
of
porridge
this
dish
was
served
three
times
a
week
and
the
dogs
were
simply
mad
for
it
they
very
soon
learned
to
keep
count
of
the
days
when
this
mess
was
to
be
expected
and
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
rattling
of
the
tin
dishes
in
which
the
separate
portions
were
carried
round
they
set
up
such
a
noise
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
oneself
speak
both
the
preparation
and
the
serving
out
of
this
extra
ration
were
at
times
rather
troublesome
but
it
was
well
worth
it
it
is
quite
certain
that
our
complement
of
dogs
would
have
made
a
poor
show
on
arrival
at
the
bay
of
whales
if
we
had
shrunk
from
the
trouble
the
dried
fish
was
not
nearly
so
popular
as
the
daenge
but
to
make
up
for
that
there
was
plenty
of
it
not
that
the
dogs
themselves
ever
thought
they
could
have
enough
indeed
they
were
always
stealing
from
their
neighbours
perhaps
more
for
the
sake
of
the
sport
than
for
anything
else
in
any
case
as
a
sport
it
was
extremely
popular
and
it
took
many
a
good
hiding
to
get
the
rascals
to
understand
that
it
could
not
be
allowed
i
am
afraid
though
that
they
kept
up
their
thieving
even
after
they
knew
very
well
that
it
was
wrong
the
habit
was
too
old
to
be
corrected
another
habit
and
a
very
bad
one
that
these
eskimo
dogs
have
fallen
into
in
the
course
of
ages
and
of
which
we
tried
to
break
them
at
all
events
during
the
sea
voyage
is
their
tendency
to
hold
howling
concerts
what
the
real
meaning
of
these
performances
may
be
whether
they
are
a
pastime
or
an
expression
of
gratification
or
the
reverse
we
could
never
decide
to
our
satisfaction
they
began
suddenly
and
without
warning
the
whole
pack
might
be
lying
perfectly
still
and
quiet
when
a
single
individual
who
for
that
occasion
had
taken
upon
himself
the
part
of
leader
of
the
chorus
would
set
up
a
long
yowl
if
they
were
left
to
themselves
it
was
not
long
before
the
whole
pack
joined
in
and
this
infernal
din
was
kept
going
at
full
steam
for
two
or
three
minutes
the
only
amusing
thing
about
the
entertainment
was
its
conclusion
they
all
stopped
short
at
the
same
instant
just
as
a
chorus
obeys
the
baton
of
its
conductor
those
of
us
however
who
happened
to
be
in
our
bunks
found
nothing
at
all
amusing
in
these
concerts
either
in
the
finale
or
anything
else
for
they
were
calculated
to
tear
the
soundest
sleeper
from
his
slumbers
but
if
one
only
took
care
to
stop
the
leader
in
his
efforts
the
whole
affair
was
nipped
in
the
bud
and
we
usually
succeeded
in
doing
this
if
there
were
some
who
at
first
were
anxious
about
their
night
rest
these
fears
were
soon
dispersed
on
leaving
norway
we
had
dogs
in
all
and
of
these
no
less
than
ten
were
bitches
this
fact
justified
us
in
expecting
an
increase
of
the
canine
population
on
our
voyage
to
the
south
and
our
expectations
were
very
soon
fulfilled
the
first
happy
event
occurred
when
we
had
been
no
more
than
three
weeks
at
sea
an
incident
of
this
kind
may
seem
in
itself
of
no
great
importance
to
us
living
under
conditions
in
which
one
day
was
almost
exactly
like
another
it
was
more
than
enough
to
be
an
object
of
the
greatest
interest
therefore
when
the
report
went
round
that
camilla
had
got
four
shapely
youngsters
there
was
general
rejoicing
two
of
the
pups
who
happened
to
be
of
the
male
sex
were
allowed
to
live
the
females
were
sent
out
of
this
world
long
before
their
eyes
were
opened
to
its
joys
and
sorrows
it
might
be
thought
that
seeing
we
had
nearly
a
hundred
dogs
on
board
there
would
be
little
opportunity
for
looking
after
puppies
that
this
was
done
nevertheless
with
all
the
care
that
could
be
wished
is
due
in
the
first
instance
to
the
touching
affection
of
the
second
in
command
for
the
little
ones
from
the
very
first
moment
he
was
their
avowed
protector
gradually
as
the
numbers
increased
there
was
a
difficulty
in
finding
room
on
the
already
deck
i
take
them
in
my
bunk
said
the
second
in
command
it
did
not
come
to
that
but
if
it
had
been
necessary
he
would
certainly
have
done
so
the
example
was
catching
later
on
when
the
little
chaps
were
weaned
and
had
begun
to
take
other
nourishment
one
might
see
regularly
after
every
meal
one
after
another
of
the
crew
coming
on
deck
with
some
carefully
bits
of
food
on
his
plate
the
little
hungry
mouths
were
to
have
what
was
left
over
something
more
than
patience
and
punctual
performance
of
duty
is
displayed
in
such
things
as
those
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
it
is
love
of
and
a
living
interest
in
one
work
from
what
i
saw
and
heard
every
day
i
was
certain
that
these
necessary
incentives
were
present
although
as
far
as
most
of
the
men
were
concerned
our
object
was
still
the
protracted
one
of
drifting
for
years
in
the
arctic
ice
the
extension
of
the
plan
the
far
more
imminent
battle
with
the
of
the
south
was
still
undreamt
of
by
the
majority
of
the
ship
company
i
considered
it
necessary
to
keep
it
to
myself
for
a
little
while
yet
until
our
departure
from
the
port
we
were
now
making
for
funchal
madeira
it
may
possibly
appear
to
many
people
that
i
was
running
a
pretty
big
risk
in
thus
putting
off
till
the
last
moment
the
duty
of
informing
my
comrades
of
the
very
considerable
detour
we
were
to
make
suppose
some
or
perhaps
all
of
them
had
objected
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
was
a
big
risk
but
there
were
so
many
risks
that
had
to
be
taken
at
that
time
however
as
i
got
to
know
each
man
during
these
first
few
weeks
of
our
long
voyage
i
soon
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
there
was
nobody
on
board
the
fram
who
would
try
to
put
difficulties
in
the
way
on
the
contrary
i
had
more
and
more
reason
to
hope
that
they
would
all
receive
the
news
with
joy
when
they
heard
it
for
then
their
whole
prospect
would
be
so
different
everything
had
gone
with
surprising
ease
up
to
this
time
in
future
it
would
go
even
better
it
was
not
without
a
certain
longing
that
i
looked
forward
to
our
arrival
at
madeira
it
would
be
grand
to
be
able
to
speak
out
no
doubt
the
others
who
knew
of
the
plan
were
equally
eager
secrets
are
neither
amusing
nor
easy
to
carry
about
least
of
all
on
board
a
ship
where
one
has
to
live
at
such
close
quarters
as
we
had
we
were
chatting
together
every
day
of
course
and
the
uninitiated
could
not
be
deterred
from
leading
the
conversation
round
to
the
ugly
difficulties
that
would
embitter
our
lives
and
hinder
our
progress
when
rounding
the
horn
it
was
likely
enough
that
we
should
manage
to
bring
the
dogs
safely
through
the
tropics
once
but
whether
we
should
succeed
in
doing
so
twice
was
more
doubtful
and
so
on
to
infinity
it
is
easier
to
imagine
than
to
describe
how
awkward
all
this
was
and
how
cunningly
one
had
to
choose
one
words
to
avoid
saying
too
much
among
inexperienced
men
there
would
have
been
no
great
difficulty
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
on
the
fram
pretty
nearly
every
second
man
had
spent
years
of
his
life
in
polar
voyages
a
single
slight
hint
to
them
would
have
been
enough
to
expose
the
whole
plan
that
neither
those
on
board
nor
anyone
else
discovered
it
prematurely
can
only
be
explained
by
its
being
so
obvious
our
ship
was
a
good
deal
too
dependent
on
wind
and
weather
to
enable
us
to
make
any
accurate
estimate
of
the
time
our
voyage
would
occupy
especially
as
regards
those
latitudes
in
which
the
winds
are
variable
the
estimate
for
the
whole
voyage
was
based
on
an
average
speed
of
four
knots
and
at
this
very
modest
rate
as
it
may
seem
we
ought
to
arrive
at
the
lce
barrier
about
the
middle
of
january
as
will
be
seen
later
this
was
realized
with
remarkable
exactness
for
reaching
madeira
we
had
allowed
a
month
as
a
reasonable
time
we
did
a
good
deal
better
than
this
as
we
were
able
to
leave
funchal
a
month
to
the
day
after
our
departure
from
christiansand
we
were
always
ready
to
forgive
the
estimate
when
it
was
at
fault
in
this
way
the
delay
to
which
we
had
been
subjected
in
the
english
channel
was
fortunately
made
up
along
the
coast
of
spain
and
to
the
south
of
it
the
north
wind
held
until
we
were
in
the
trade
and
then
we
were
all
right
on
september
our
observations
at
noon
told
us
that
we
might
expect
to
see
the
lights
that
evening
and
at
the
light
of
san
lorenzo
on
the
little
island
of
fora
near
madeira
was
reported
from
the
rigging
chapter
iv
from
madeira
to
the
barrier
on
the
following
morning
we
anchored
in
funchal
roads
my
brother
was
to
arrive
at
funchal
by
arrangement
early
enough
to
be
sure
of
preceding
us
there
it
was
however
a
good
while
before
we
saw
anything
of
him
and
we
were
already
flattering
ourselves
that
we
had
arrived
first
when
he
was
suddenly
observed
in
a
boat
coming
under
our
stern
we
were
able
to
tell
him
that
all
was
well
on
board
and
he
brought
us
a
big
packet
of
letters
and
newspapers
that
gave
us
news
of
home
a
little
officious
gentleman
who
said
he
was
a
doctor
and
as
such
had
come
in
an
official
capacity
to
inquire
as
to
the
state
of
our
health
was
in
an
amazing
hurry
to
leave
the
ship
again
when
at
the
top
of
the
gangway
he
found
himself
confronted
with
a
score
of
dogs
jaws
which
at
the
moment
were
opened
wide
on
account
of
the
heat
the
learned
man
interest
in
our
health
had
suddenly
vanished
his
thoughts
flew
to
the
safety
of
his
own
life
and
limbs
as
funchal
was
the
last
place
where
we
could
communicate
with
the
outside
world
arrangements
were
made
for
completing
our
supplies
in
every
possible
way
and
in
particular
we
had
to
take
on
board
all
the
fresh
water
we
could
the
consumption
of
this
commodity
would
be
very
large
and
the
possibility
of
running
short
had
to
be
avoided
at
any
price
for
the
time
being
we
could
do
no
more
than
fill
all
our
tanks
and
every
imaginable
receptacle
with
the
precious
fluid
and
this
was
done
we
took
about
gallons
in
the
that
was
carried
just
above
the
main
hatch
this
was
rather
a
risky
experiment
which
might
have
had
awkward
consequences
in
the
event
of
the
vessel
rolling
but
we
consoled
ourselves
with
the
hope
of
fine
weather
and
a
smooth
sea
during
the
next
few
weeks
during
the
stay
at
funchal
the
dogs
had
two
good
meals
of
fresh
meat
as
a
very
welcome
variety
in
their
diet
a
carcass
of
a
horse
disappeared
with
impressive
rapidity
at
each
of
these
banquets
for
our
own
use
we
naturally
took
a
plentiful
supply
of
vegetables
and
fruits
which
were
here
to
be
had
in
abundance
it
was
the
last
opportunity
we
should
have
of
regaling
ourselves
with
such
luxuries
our
stay
at
funchal
was
somewhat
longer
than
was
intended
at
first
as
the
engineers
found
it
necessary
to
take
up
the
propeller
and
examine
the
brasses
this
work
would
occupy
two
days
and
while
the
three
mechanics
were
toiling
in
the
heat
the
rest
of
the
company
took
the
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
town
and
its
surroundings
the
crew
had
a
day
leave
half
at
a
time
an
excursion
was
arranged
to
one
of
the
numerous
hotels
that
are
situated
on
the
heights
about
the
town
the
ascent
is
easily
made
by
means
of
a
funicular
railway
and
in
the
course
of
the
it
takes
to
reach
the
top
one
is
able
to
get
an
idea
of
the
luxuriant
fertility
of
the
island
at
the
hotels
one
finds
a
good
cuisine
and
of
course
still
better
wine
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
we
did
full
justice
to
both
for
the
descent
a
more
primitive
means
of
transport
was
employed
we
came
down
on
sledges
it
may
be
startling
to
hear
of
sledging
in
madeira
but
i
must
explain
that
the
sledges
had
wooden
runners
and
that
the
road
was
paved
with
a
black
stone
that
was
very
smooth
we
went
at
a
creditable
pace
down
the
steep
inclines
each
sledge
being
drawn
or
pushed
by
three
or
four
swarthy
natives
who
seemed
to
be
possessed
of
legs
and
lungs
it
may
be
mentioned
as
a
curiosity
that
the
newspapers
of
funchal
did
not
hesitate
to
connect
our
expedition
with
the
south
pole
the
native
journalists
had
no
idea
of
the
value
of
the
startling
piece
of
news
they
were
circulating
it
was
a
canard
invented
on
the
supposition
that
when
a
polar
ship
steers
to
the
south
she
must
of
course
be
making
for
the
south
pole
in
this
case
the
canard
happened
to
be
true
fortunately
for
us
it
did
not
fly
beyond
the
shores
of
madeira
by
the
afternoon
of
september
we
could
begin
to
make
our
preparations
for
departure
the
engineers
had
replaced
the
propeller
and
tested
it
all
supplies
were
on
board
and
the
chronometers
had
been
checked
all
that
remained
was
to
get
rid
of
the
importunate
bumboat
men
who
swarmed
round
the
vessel
in
their
little
craft
each
looking
like
a
small
floating
shop
these
obtrusive
fellows
were
quickly
sent
off
down
the
gangway
besides
ourselves
only
my
brother
was
left
on
board
now
that
we
were
thus
completely
isolated
from
the
outer
world
the
moment
had
arrived
when
i
could
proceed
to
inform
all
my
comrades
of
my
decision
now
a
year
old
to
make
for
the
south
i
believe
all
who
were
on
board
will
long
remember
that
sultry
afternoon
in
funchal
roads
all
hands
were
called
on
deck
what
they
thought
of
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
hardly
antarctica
and
the
south
pole
lieutenant
nilsen
carried
a
big
chart
i
could
see
that
this
chart
was
the
object
of
many
interrogative
glances
not
many
words
were
needed
before
everyone
could
see
where
the
wind
lay
and
what
course
we
should
steer
henceforward
the
second
in
command
unrolled
his
big
chart
of
the
southern
hemisphere
and
i
briefly
explained
the
extended
plan
as
well
as
my
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
until
this
time
now
and
again
i
had
to
glance
at
their
faces
at
first
as
might
be
expected
they
showed
the
most
unmistakable
signs
of
surprise
but
this
expression
swiftly
changed
and
before
i
had
finished
they
were
all
bright
with
smiles
i
was
now
sure
of
the
answer
i
should
get
when
i
finally
asked
each
man
whether
he
was
willing
to
go
on
and
as
the
names
were
called
every
single
man
had
his
yes
ready
although
as
i
have
said
i
had
expected
it
to
turn
out
as
it
did
it
is
difficult
to
express
the
joy
i
felt
at
seeing
how
promptly
my
comrades
placed
themselves
at
my
service
on
this
momentous
occasion
it
appeared
however
that
i
was
not
the
only
one
who
was
pleased
there
was
so
much
life
and
good
spirits
on
board
that
evening
that
one
would
have
thought
the
work
was
successfully
accomplished
instead
of
being
hardly
begun
for
the
present
however
there
was
not
much
time
to
spare
for
discussing
the
news
we
had
first
to
see
about
getting
away
afterwards
there
would
be
many
months
before
us
two
hours
grace
was
allowed
in
which
every
man
could
write
to
his
people
at
home
about
what
had
just
passed
the
letters
were
probably
not
very
long
ones
at
all
events
they
were
soon
finished
the
mail
was
handed
over
to
my
brother
to
take
to
christiania
from
whence
the
letters
were
sent
to
their
respective
destinations
but
this
did
not
take
place
until
after
the
alteration
of
our
plans
had
been
published
in
the
press
it
had
been
easy
enough
to
tell
my
comrades
the
news
and
they
could
not
have
given
it
a
better
reception
it
was
another
question
what
people
at
home
would
say
when
the
intelligence
reached
their
ears
we
afterwards
heard
that
both
favourable
and
unfavourable
opinions
were
expressed
for
the
moment
we
could
not
trouble
ourselves
very
greatly
with
that
side
of
the
matter
my
brother
had
undertaken
to
announce
the
way
we
had
taken
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
envied
him
the
task
after
we
had
all
given
him
a
final
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
he
left
us
and
thereby
our
communication
with
the
busy
world
was
broken
off
we
were
left
to
our
own
resources
no
one
can
say
that
the
situation
oppressed
us
greatly
our
long
voyage
was
entered
upon
as
though
it
were
a
dance
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
more
or
less
melancholy
feeling
that
usually
accompanies
any
parting
the
men
joked
and
laughed
while
witticisms
both
good
and
bad
were
bandied
about
on
the
subject
of
our
original
situation
the
anchor
came
up
more
quickly
than
usual
and
after
the
motor
had
helped
us
to
escape
from
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
harbour
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
every
sail
filled
with
the
fresh
and
cooling
trade
the
dogs
who
must
have
found
the
stay
at
funchal
rather
too
warm
for
their
taste
expressed
their
delight
at
the
welcome
breeze
by
getting
up
a
concert
we
felt
we
could
not
grudge
them
the
pleasure
this
time
it
was
pure
enjoyment
to
come
on
deck
the
morning
after
leaving
madeira
there
was
an
added
note
of
friendliness
in
every
and
a
smile
twinkled
in
the
corner
of
every
eye
the
entirely
new
turn
things
had
taken
and
the
sudden
change
to
fresh
fields
for
thought
and
imagination
acted
as
a
beneficent
stimulus
to
those
who
the
day
before
had
contemplated
a
trip
round
the
horn
i
think
what
chiefly
amused
them
was
their
failure
to
smell
a
rat
before
how
could
i
have
been
such
an
ass
as
not
to
think
of
it
long
ago
said
beck
as
he
sent
a
nearly
new
quid
into
the
sea
of
course
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
here
we
are
with
all
these
dogs
this
fine
house
with
its
big
and
shiny
cloth
on
the
table
and
everything
else
any
fool
might
have
seen
what
it
meant
i
consoled
him
with
the
remark
that
it
is
always
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
and
that
i
thought
it
very
lucky
no
one
had
discovered
our
destination
prematurely
those
of
us
who
had
been
obliged
hitherto
to
keep
to
themselves
what
they
knew
and
to
resort
to
all
kinds
of
stratagems
to
avoid
making
any
disclosure
were
certainly
no
less
pleased
at
being
rid
of
the
secret
now
they
could
talk
freely
to
their
heart
content
if
we
had
previously
had
to
resort
to
mystification
there
was
now
nothing
to
prevent
our
laying
our
cards
on
the
table
so
many
a
conversation
had
come
to
a
standstill
because
those
who
had
a
number
of
questions
to
ask
did
not
dare
to
put
them
and
those
who
could
have
told
held
their
tongues
hereafter
it
would
be
a
very
long
time
before
we
were
at
a
loss
for
subjects
of
conversation
a
theme
had
suddenly
presented
itself
so
varied
and
comprehensive
that
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
know
where
to
begin
there
were
many
men
on
board
the
fram
with
a
wealth
of
experience
gained
during
years
spent
within
the
arctic
circle
but
to
almost
all
of
us
the
great
antarctic
continent
was
a
terra
incognita
i
myself
was
the
only
man
on
board
who
had
seen
antarctica
perhaps
one
or
two
of
my
companions
had
in
former
days
passed
in
the
vicinity
of
an
antarctic
iceberg
on
a
voyage
round
cape
horn
but
that
was
all
what
had
previously
been
accomplished
in
the
way
of
exploration
in
the
south
and
the
narratives
of
the
men
who
had
endeavoured
to
extend
our
knowledge
of
that
inhospitable
continent
were
also
things
that
very
few
of
the
ship
company
had
had
time
or
opportunity
to
study
nor
had
they
perhaps
had
any
reason
to
do
so
now
there
was
every
possible
reason
i
considered
it
an
imperative
necessity
that
every
man
should
acquaint
himself
as
far
as
possible
with
the
work
of
previous
expeditions
this
was
the
only
way
of
becoming
in
some
measure
familiar
with
the
conditions
in
which
we
should
have
to
work
for
this
reason
the
fram
carried
a
whole
library
of
antarctic
literature
containing
everything
that
has
been
written
by
the
long
succession
of
explorers
in
these
regions
from
james
cook
and
james
clark
ross
to
captain
scott
and
sir
ernest
shackleton
and
indeed
good
use
was
made
of
this
library
the
works
of
the
two
explorers
were
in
chief
request
they
were
read
from
cover
to
cover
by
all
who
could
do
so
and
well
written
and
excellently
illustrated
as
these
narratives
are
they
were
highly
instructive
but
if
ample
time
was
thus
devoted
to
the
theoretical
study
of
our
problem
the
practical
preparations
were
not
neglected
as
soon
as
we
were
in
the
where
the
virtually
constant
direction
and
force
of
the
wind
permitted
a
reduction
of
the
watch
on
deck
the
various
specialists
went
to
work
to
put
our
extensive
wintering
outfit
in
the
best
possible
order
it
is
true
that
every
precaution
had
been
taken
beforehand
to
have
every
part
of
the
equipment
as
good
and
as
well
adapted
to
its
purpose
as
possible
but
the
whole
of
it
nevertheless
required
a
thorough
overhauling
with
so
complicated
an
outfit
as
ours
was
one
is
never
really
at
the
end
of
one
work
it
will
always
be
found
that
some
improvement
or
other
can
be
made
it
will
appear
later
that
we
had
our
hands
more
than
full
of
the
preparations
for
the
sledge
journey
not
only
during
the
long
sea
voyage
but
also
during
the
still
longer
antarctic
winter
our
sailmaker
ronne
was
transformed
into
a
well
let
us
call
it
tailor
ronne
pride
was
a
which
he
had
obtained
from
the
yard
at
horten
after
considerable
use
of
his
persuasive
tongue
his
greatest
sorrow
on
the
voyage
was
that
on
arriving
at
the
barrier
he
would
be
obliged
to
hand
over
his
treasure
to
the
shore
party
he
could
not
understand
what
we
wanted
with
a
at
framheim
the
first
thing
he
did
when
the
fram
reached
buenos
aires
was
to
explain
to
the
local
representative
of
the
singer
sewing
machine
company
how
absolutely
necessary
it
was
to
have
his
loss
made
good
his
gift
of
persuasion
helped
him
again
and
he
got
a
new
machine
for
that
matter
it
was
not
surprising
that
ronne
was
fond
of
his
machine
he
could
use
it
for
all
sorts
of
things
sailmaker
shoemaker
saddler
and
tailor
work
was
all
turned
out
with
equal
celerity
he
established
his
workshop
in
the
and
there
the
machine
hummed
incessantly
through
the
tropics
the
west
wind
belt
and
the
too
for
quick
as
our
sailmaker
was
with
his
fingers
the
orders
poured
in
even
more
quickly
ronne
was
one
of
those
men
whose
ambition
it
is
to
get
as
much
work
as
possible
done
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
with
increasing
astonishment
he
saw
that
here
he
would
never
be
finished
he
might
go
at
it
as
hard
as
he
liked
there
was
always
something
more
to
reckon
up
all
that
he
delivered
from
his
workshop
during
these
months
would
take
us
too
long
it
is
enough
to
say
that
all
the
work
was
remarkably
well
done
and
executed
with
admirable
rapidity
perhaps
one
of
the
things
he
personally
prided
himself
most
on
having
made
was
the
little
tent
which
was
afterwards
left
at
the
south
pole
it
was
a
little
masterpiece
of
a
tent
made
of
thin
silk
which
when
folded
together
would
easily
have
gone
into
a
pocket
and
weighed
hardly
a
kilogram
at
this
time
we
could
not
count
with
certainty
on
the
possibility
of
all
those
who
made
the
southern
journey
reaching
latitude
on
the
contrary
we
had
to
be
prepared
for
the
probability
of
some
of
the
party
being
obliged
to
turn
back
it
was
intended
that
we
should
use
the
tent
in
question
in
case
it
might
be
decided
to
let
two
or
three
men
make
the
final
dash
and
therefore
it
was
made
as
small
and
light
as
possible
fortunately
we
had
no
need
to
use
it
as
every
man
reached
the
goal
and
we
then
found
that
the
best
way
of
disposing
of
ronne
work
of
art
was
to
let
it
stay
there
as
a
mark
our
sailmaker
had
no
dogs
of
his
own
to
look
after
he
had
no
time
for
that
on
the
other
hand
he
often
assisted
me
in
attending
to
my
fourteen
friends
up
on
the
bridge
but
he
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
getting
on
terms
of
familiarity
with
the
dogs
and
all
that
belonged
to
them
it
did
not
quite
agree
with
his
idea
of
life
on
board
ship
to
have
a
deck
swarming
with
dogs
he
regarded
this
abnormal
state
of
things
with
a
sort
of
scornful
compassion
so
you
carry
dogs
too
aboard
this
ship
he
would
say
every
time
he
came
on
deck
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
brutes
the
poor
brutes
i
am
sure
made
no
attempt
to
attack
ronne
person
more
than
anyone
else
but
he
seemed
for
a
long
time
to
have
great
doubts
about
it
i
do
think
he
felt
perfectly
safe
until
the
dogs
had
been
muzzled
a
part
of
our
equipment
to
which
we
gave
special
care
was
of
course
the
ski
in
all
probability
they
would
be
our
chief
weapon
in
the
coming
fight
however
much
we
might
have
to
learn
from
scott
and
shackleton
narratives
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
understand
their
statements
that
the
use
of
ski
on
the
barrier
was
not
a
success
from
the
descriptions
that
were
given
of
the
nature
of
the
surface
and
the
general
conditions
we
were
forced
to
the
opposite
conclusion
that
ski
were
the
only
means
to
employ
nothing
was
spared
to
provide
a
good
skiing
outfit
and
we
had
an
experienced
man
in
charge
of
it
olav
bjaaland
it
is
sufficient
to
mention
his
name
when
on
leaving
norway
it
was
a
question
of
finding
a
good
place
for
our
twenty
pairs
of
ski
we
found
we
should
have
to
share
our
own
quarters
with
them
they
were
all
disposed
under
the
ceiling
of
the
at
any
rate
we
had
no
better
place
to
put
them
bjaaland
who
during
the
last
month
or
two
had
tried
his
hand
at
the
unaccustomed
work
of
a
seaman
went
back
to
his
old
trade
of
and
carpenter
when
we
came
into
the
both
ski
and
bindings
were
delivered
ready
for
use
by
hagen
and
of
christiania
it
remained
to
adapt
them
and
fit
the
backstraps
to
each
man
boots
so
that
all
might
be
ready
for
use
on
arrival
at
the
barrier
a
full
skiing
outfit
had
been
provided
for
every
man
so
that
those
who
were
to
be
left
on
board
might
also
have
a
run
now
and
then
during
their
stay
at
the
ice
edge
for
each
of
our
ten
sledges
bjaaland
made
during
the
voyage
a
pair
of
loose
runners
which
it
was
intended
to
use
in
the
same
way
as
the
eskimo
use
theirs
these
primitive
people
have
or
at
all
events
had
no
material
that
was
suited
for
shoeing
they
get
over
the
difficulty
by
covering
the
runners
with
a
coating
of
ice
no
doubt
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
practice
and
patience
to
put
on
this
kind
of
shoeing
properly
but
when
it
is
once
on
there
can
be
no
question
that
this
device
throws
all
others
into
the
shade
as
i
say
we
had
intended
to
try
this
on
the
barrier
we
found
however
that
the
pulling
power
of
our
teams
was
so
good
as
to
allow
us
to
retain
our
runners
with
an
easy
conscience
for
the
first
fourteen
days
after
leaving
madeira
the
trade
was
fresh
enough
to
enable
us
to
keep
up
our
average
rate
or
a
little
more
with
the
help
of
the
sails
alone
the
engine
was
therefore
allowed
a
rest
and
the
engineers
had
an
opportunity
of
cleaning
and
polishing
it
this
they
did
early
and
late
till
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
never
get
it
bright
enough
nodtvedt
now
had
a
chance
of
devoting
himself
to
the
occupation
which
is
his
delight
in
this
world
that
of
the
blacksmith
and
indeed
there
was
opportunity
enough
for
his
use
of
the
hammer
and
anvil
if
ronne
had
plenty
of
sewing
nodtvedt
had
no
less
forging
knives
pickaxes
bars
and
bolts
patent
hooks
by
the
hundred
for
dogs
chains
and
so
on
to
infinity
the
clang
and
sparks
of
the
anvil
were
going
all
day
long
till
we
were
well
into
the
indian
ocean
and
in
the
westerly
belt
the
blacksmith
lot
was
not
an
enviable
one
it
is
not
always
easy
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
one
feet
rest
on
so
unstable
a
foundation
as
the
fram
deck
nor
is
it
altogether
pleasant
when
the
forge
is
filled
with
water
several
times
a
day
while
we
were
fitting
out
for
the
voyage
the
cry
was
constantly
raised
in
certain
quarters
at
home
that
the
old
fram
hull
was
in
a
shocking
state
it
was
said
to
be
in
bad
repair
to
leak
like
a
sieve
in
fact
to
be
altogether
rotten
it
throws
a
curious
light
on
these
reports
when
we
look
at
the
voyages
that
the
fram
has
accomplished
in
the
last
two
years
for
twenty
months
out
of
she
has
kept
going
in
open
sea
and
that
too
in
waters
which
make
very
serious
demands
on
a
vessel
strength
she
is
just
as
good
as
when
she
sailed
and
could
easily
do
it
all
over
again
without
any
repairs
we
who
were
on
board
all
knew
perfectly
well
before
we
sailed
how
groundless
and
foolish
these
cries
about
her
rottenness
were
we
knew
too
that
there
is
scarcely
a
wooden
ship
afloat
on
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
use
the
pumps
now
and
then
when
the
engine
was
stopped
we
found
it
was
sufficient
to
take
a
ten
minutes
turn
at
the
every
morning
that
was
all
the
leaking
amounted
to
oh
no
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
fram
hull
on
the
other
hand
there
might
be
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
the
rigging
if
this
was
not
all
it
should
have
been
the
fault
lay
entirely
with
the
plaguy
considerations
of
our
budget
on
the
foremast
we
had
two
squaresails
there
ought
to
have
been
four
on
the
there
were
two
staysails
there
was
room
enough
for
three
but
the
money
would
not
run
to
it
in
the
trades
we
tried
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
by
rigging
a
alongside
the
foresail
and
a
above
the
topsail
i
will
not
assert
that
these
improvised
sails
contributed
to
improve
the
appearance
but
they
got
her
along
and
that
is
a
great
deal
more
important
we
made
very
fair
progress
southward
during
these
september
days
and
before
the
month
was
half
over
we
had
come
a
good
way
into
the
tropical
belt
no
particularly
tropical
heat
was
felt
at
any
rate
by
us
men
and
as
a
rule
the
heat
is
not
severely
felt
on
board
ship
in
open
sea
so
long
as
the
vessel
is
moving
on
a
lying
becalmed
with
the
sun
in
the
zenith
it
might
be
warmer
than
one
would
wish
but
in
case
of
calms
we
had
the
engine
to
help
us
so
that
there
was
always
a
little
breeze
that
is
on
deck
down
below
it
was
worse
sometimes
hoggishly
mild
as
beck
used
to
put
it
our
otherwise
comfortable
cabins
had
one
fault
there
were
no
portholes
in
the
ship
side
and
therefore
we
could
not
get
a
draught
but
most
of
us
managed
without
shifting
our
quarters
of
the
two
saloons
the
was
decidedly
preferable
in
warm
weather
in
a
cold
climate
probably
the
reverse
would
be
the
case
we
were
able
to
secure
a
thorough
draught
of
air
forward
through
the
alleyway
leading
to
the
forecastle
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
good
circulation
aft
where
they
also
had
the
warm
proximity
of
the
engine
the
engineers
of
course
had
the
hottest
place
but
the
sundbeck
devised
a
means
of
improving
the
ventilation
of
the
so
that
even
there
they
were
not
so
badly
off
under
the
circumstances
one
often
hears
it
asked
which
is
to
be
preferred
severe
heat
or
severe
cold
it
is
not
easy
to
give
a
definite
answer
neither
of
the
two
is
pleasant
and
it
must
remain
a
matter
of
taste
which
is
least
so
on
board
ship
no
doubt
most
people
will
vote
for
heat
as
even
if
the
days
are
rather
distressing
one
has
the
glorious
nights
to
make
up
for
them
a
bitterly
cold
day
is
poorly
compensated
for
by
an
even
colder
night
one
decided
advantage
of
a
warm
climate
for
men
who
have
to
be
frequently
in
and
out
of
their
clothes
and
their
bunks
is
the
simplicity
of
costume
which
it
allows
when
you
wear
hardly
anything
it
takes
a
very
short
time
to
dress
if
we
had
been
able
to
take
the
opinion
of
our
dogs
on
their
existence
in
the
tropics
they
would
probably
have
answered
as
one
dog
thanks
let
us
get
back
to
rather
cooler
surroundings
their
coats
were
not
exactly
calculated
for
a
temperature
of
in
the
shade
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
they
could
not
change
them
it
is
by
the
way
a
misunderstanding
to
suppose
that
these
animals
absolutely
must
have
hard
frost
to
be
comfortable
on
the
contrary
they
prefer
to
be
nice
and
warm
here
in
the
tropics
of
course
they
had
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
but
they
did
not
suffer
from
the
heat
by
stretching
awnings
over
the
whole
ship
we
contrived
that
they
should
all
be
constantly
in
the
shade
and
so
long
as
they
were
not
directly
exposed
to
the
sun
rays
there
was
no
fear
of
anything
going
wrong
how
well
they
came
through
it
appears
best
from
the
fact
that
not
one
of
them
was
on
the
on
account
of
the
heat
during
the
whole
voyage
only
two
deaths
occurred
from
sickness
one
was
the
case
of
a
bitch
that
died
after
giving
birth
to
eight
pups
which
might
just
as
easily
have
caused
her
death
under
other
conditions
what
was
the
cause
of
death
in
the
other
case
we
were
unable
to
find
out
at
any
rate
it
was
not
an
infectious
disease
one
of
our
greatest
fears
was
the
possibility
of
an
epidemic
among
the
dogs
but
thanks
to
the
care
with
which
they
had
been
picked
there
was
never
a
sign
of
anything
of
the
sort
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
equator
between
the
and
the
trades
lies
what
is
called
the
belt
of
calms
the
position
and
extent
of
this
belt
vary
somewhat
with
the
season
if
you
are
extremely
lucky
it
may
happen
that
one
will
practically
take
you
over
into
the
other
but
as
a
rule
this
region
will
cause
quite
a
serious
delay
to
either
there
are
frequent
calms
or
shifting
and
unsteady
winds
we
arrived
there
at
an
unfavourable
time
of
the
year
and
lost
the
trade
as
early
as
ten
degrees
north
of
the
line
if
we
had
had
the
calms
we
looked
for
we
could
have
got
across
with
the
help
of
the
engine
in
a
reasonably
short
time
but
we
saw
very
little
sign
of
calms
as
a
rule
there
was
an
obstinate
south
wind
blowing
and
it
would
not
have
taken
very
much
of
it
to
make
the
last
few
degrees
of
north
latitude
stiffer
than
we
cared
for
the
delay
was
annoying
enough
but
we
had
another
disappointment
of
a
more
serious
kind
for
curiously
enough
we
never
had
a
proper
shower
of
rain
generally
in
these
latitudes
one
encounters
extremely
heavy
downpours
which
make
it
possible
to
collect
water
by
the
barrelful
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
we
had
hoped
in
this
way
to
increase
our
store
of
fresh
water
which
was
not
so
large
but
that
extreme
economy
had
to
be
practised
if
we
were
to
avoid
running
short
however
this
hope
failed
us
practically
speaking
we
managed
to
catch
a
little
water
but
it
was
altogether
insufficient
and
the
husbanding
of
our
supply
had
to
be
enforced
in
future
with
authority
the
dogs
required
their
daily
ration
and
they
got
it
measured
out
to
a
our
own
consumption
was
limited
to
what
was
strictly
necessary
soups
were
banished
from
the
bill
of
fare
they
used
too
much
of
the
precious
fluid
washing
in
fresh
water
was
forbidden
it
must
not
be
supposed
from
this
that
we
had
no
opportunity
of
washing
we
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
soap
which
lathered
just
as
well
in
salt
water
as
in
fresh
and
was
thus
capable
of
keeping
ourselves
and
our
clothes
as
clean
as
before
if
for
a
time
we
had
felt
a
certain
anxiety
about
our
these
fears
were
banished
comparatively
quickly
as
the
reserve
we
had
taken
in
the
on
deck
lasted
an
incredibly
long
time
almost
twice
as
long
as
we
had
dared
to
hope
and
this
saved
the
situation
or
very
nearly
so
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
we
should
be
obliged
to
call
at
one
of
the
numerous
groups
of
islands
that
would
lie
in
our
route
later
on
for
over
six
weeks
the
dogs
had
now
been
chained
up
in
the
places
assigned
to
them
when
they
came
on
board
in
the
course
of
that
time
most
of
them
had
become
so
tame
and
tractable
that
we
thought
we
might
soon
let
them
loose
this
would
be
a
welcome
change
for
them
and
what
was
more
important
it
would
give
them
an
opportunity
for
exercise
to
tell
the
truth
we
also
expected
some
amusement
from
it
there
would
certainly
be
a
proper
shindy
when
all
this
pack
got
loose
but
before
we
gave
them
their
liberty
we
were
obliged
to
disarm
them
otherwise
the
inevitable
free
fight
would
be
liable
to
result
in
one
or
more
of
them
being
left
on
the
and
we
could
not
afford
that
every
one
of
them
was
provided
with
a
strong
muzzle
then
we
let
them
loose
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
at
first
nothing
at
all
happened
it
looked
as
if
they
had
abandoned
once
for
all
the
thought
of
ever
moving
from
the
spot
they
had
occupied
so
long
at
last
a
solitary
individual
had
the
bright
idea
of
attempting
a
walk
along
the
deck
but
he
should
not
have
done
so
it
was
dangerous
to
move
about
here
the
unaccustomed
sight
of
a
loose
dog
at
once
aroused
his
nearest
neighbours
a
dozen
of
them
flung
themselves
upon
the
unfortunate
animal
who
had
been
the
first
to
leave
his
place
rejoicing
in
the
thought
of
planting
their
teeth
in
his
sinful
body
but
to
their
disappointment
the
enjoyment
was
not
so
great
as
they
expected
the
confounded
strap
round
their
jaws
made
it
impossible
to
get
hold
of
the
skin
the
utmost
they
could
do
was
to
pull
a
few
tufts
of
hair
out
of
the
object
of
their
violent
onslaught
this
affair
of
outposts
gave
the
signal
for
a
general
engagement
all
along
the
line
what
an
unholy
row
there
was
for
the
next
couple
of
hours
the
hair
flew
but
skins
remained
intact
the
muzzles
saved
a
good
many
lives
that
afternoon
these
fights
are
the
chief
amusement
of
the
eskimo
dogs
they
follow
the
sport
with
genuine
passion
there
would
be
no
great
objection
to
it
if
they
had
not
the
peculiar
habit
of
always
combining
to
set
upon
a
single
dog
who
is
chosen
as
their
victim
for
the
occasion
they
all
make
for
this
one
and
if
they
are
left
to
themselves
they
will
not
stop
until
they
have
made
an
end
of
the
poor
beast
in
this
way
a
valuable
dog
may
be
destroyed
in
a
moment
we
therefore
naturally
made
every
effort
from
the
first
to
quench
their
love
of
fighting
and
the
dogs
very
soon
began
to
understand
that
we
were
not
particularly
fond
of
their
combats
but
we
had
here
to
deal
with
a
natural
characteristic
which
it
was
impossible
to
eradicate
in
any
case
one
could
never
be
sure
that
nature
would
not
reassert
itself
over
discipline
when
the
dogs
had
once
been
let
loose
they
remained
free
to
run
about
wherever
they
liked
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
only
at
were
they
tied
up
it
was
quite
extraordinary
how
they
managed
to
hide
themselves
in
every
hole
and
comer
on
some
mornings
there
was
hardly
a
dog
to
be
seen
when
daylight
came
of
course
they
visited
every
place
where
they
ought
not
to
have
gone
several
of
them
repeatedly
took
the
opportunity
of
tumbling
into
the
forehold
when
the
hatches
were
open
but
a
fall
of
feet
did
not
seem
to
trouble
them
in
the
least
one
even
found
his
way
into
the
difficult
as
it
might
seem
to
gain
access
to
it
and
curled
himself
up
between
the
fortunately
for
the
visitor
the
engine
was
not
started
while
he
was
there
when
the
first
furious
battles
had
been
fought
out
a
calm
soon
settled
upon
the
dogs
spirits
it
was
easy
to
notice
a
feeling
of
shame
and
disappointment
in
the
champions
when
they
found
that
all
their
efforts
led
to
nothing
the
sport
had
lost
its
principal
charm
as
soon
as
they
saw
what
a
poor
chance
there
was
of
tasting
blood
from
what
has
here
been
said
and
perhaps
from
other
accounts
of
the
nature
of
arctic
dogs
it
may
appear
as
though
the
mutual
relations
of
these
animals
consisted
exclusively
of
fighting
this
however
is
far
from
being
the
case
on
the
contrary
they
very
often
form
friendships
which
are
sometimes
so
strong
that
one
dog
simply
can
not
live
without
the
other
before
we
let
the
dogs
loose
we
had
remarked
that
there
were
a
few
who
for
some
reason
or
other
did
not
seem
as
happy
as
they
should
have
been
they
were
more
shy
and
restless
than
the
others
no
particular
notice
was
taken
of
this
and
no
one
tried
to
find
out
the
cause
of
it
the
day
we
let
them
loose
we
discovered
what
had
been
the
matter
with
the
ones
that
had
moped
they
had
some
old
friend
who
had
chanced
to
be
placed
in
some
other
part
of
the
deck
and
this
separation
had
been
the
cause
of
their
low
spirits
it
was
really
touching
to
see
the
joy
they
showed
on
meeting
again
they
became
quite
different
animals
of
course
in
these
cases
a
change
of
places
was
arranged
between
the
different
groups
so
that
those
who
had
associated
from
their
own
inclination
would
in
future
be
members
of
the
same
team
we
had
expected
to
reach
the
equator
by
october
but
the
unfavourable
conditions
of
wind
that
we
met
with
to
the
north
of
it
caused
us
to
be
a
little
behind
our
reckoning
though
not
much
on
the
afternoon
of
october
the
fram
crossed
the
line
thus
an
important
stage
of
the
voyage
was
concluded
the
feeling
that
we
had
now
reached
southern
latitudes
was
enough
to
put
us
all
in
holiday
humour
and
we
felt
we
must
get
up
a
modest
entertainment
according
to
ancient
custom
crossing
the
line
should
be
celebrated
by
a
visit
from
father
neptune
himself
whose
part
is
taken
for
the
occasion
by
someone
chosen
from
among
the
ship
company
if
in
the
course
of
his
inspection
this
august
personage
comes
upon
anyone
who
is
unable
to
prove
that
he
has
already
crossed
the
famous
circle
he
is
handed
over
at
once
to
the
attendants
to
be
shaved
and
baptized
this
process
which
is
not
always
carried
out
with
exaggerated
gentleness
causes
much
amusement
and
forms
a
welcome
variety
in
the
monotonous
life
of
a
long
sea
voyage
and
probably
many
on
board
the
fram
looked
forward
with
eagerness
to
neptune
visit
but
he
did
not
come
there
simply
was
no
room
for
him
on
our
already
deck
we
contented
ourselves
with
a
special
dinner
followed
by
coffee
liqueurs
and
cigars
coffee
was
served
on
the
where
by
moving
a
number
of
the
dogs
we
had
contrived
to
get
a
few
square
yards
of
space
there
was
no
lack
of
entertainment
a
violin
and
mandolin
orchestra
composed
of
prestrud
sundbeck
and
beck
contributed
several
pieces
and
our
excellent
gramophone
was
heard
for
the
first
time
just
as
it
started
the
waltz
from
the
count
of
luxembourg
there
appeared
in
the
a
real
masked
and
in
very
short
skirts
this
unexpected
apparition
from
a
better
world
was
greeted
with
warm
applause
which
was
no
less
vigorous
when
the
fair
one
had
given
proof
of
her
skill
in
the
art
of
dancing
behind
the
mask
could
be
detected
gjertsen
face
but
both
costume
and
dance
were
in
the
highest
degree
feminine
ronne
was
not
satisfied
until
he
had
the
lady
on
his
knees
hurrah
for
illusion
the
gramophone
now
changed
to
a
swinging
american
and
at
the
same
moment
there
opportunely
appeared
on
the
scene
a
nigger
in
a
a
silk
hat
and
a
pair
of
wooden
shoes
black
as
he
was
we
saw
at
once
that
it
was
the
second
in
command
who
had
thus
disguised
himself
the
mere
sight
of
him
was
enough
to
set
us
all
shrieking
with
laughter
but
he
made
his
great
success
when
he
began
to
dance
he
was
intensely
amusing
it
did
us
a
great
deal
of
good
to
have
a
little
amusement
just
then
for
this
part
of
the
voyage
was
a
trial
of
patience
more
than
anything
else
possibly
we
were
rather
hard
to
please
but
the
trade
which
we
were
expecting
to
meet
every
day
was
in
our
opinion
far
too
late
in
coming
and
when
at
length
it
arrived
it
did
not
behave
at
all
as
becomes
a
wind
that
has
the
reputation
of
being
the
steadiest
in
the
world
besides
being
far
too
light
according
to
our
requirements
it
permitted
itself
such
irregularities
as
swinging
between
the
points
of
south
and
east
but
was
mostly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
former
for
us
who
had
to
lie
all
the
time
to
the
westward
this
had
the
effect
of
increasing
our
western
longitude
a
great
deal
faster
than
our
latitude
we
were
rapidly
approaching
the
point
of
south
america
cape
san
roque
fortunately
we
escaped
any
closer
contact
with
this
headland
which
shoots
so
far
out
into
the
atlantic
the
wind
at
last
shifted
aft
but
it
was
so
light
that
the
motor
had
to
be
constantly
in
use
slowly
but
surely
we
now
went
southward
and
the
temperature
again
began
to
approach
the
limits
that
are
fitting
according
to
a
northerner
ideas
the
tiresome
rather
low
awning
could
be
removed
and
it
was
a
relief
to
be
rid
of
it
as
one
could
then
walk
upright
everywhere
on
october
according
to
the
observations
at
noon
we
were
in
the
vicinity
of
the
island
of
south
trinidad
one
of
the
lonely
oases
in
the
watery
desert
of
the
south
atlantic
it
was
our
intention
to
go
close
under
the
island
and
possibly
to
attempt
a
landing
but
unfortunately
the
motor
had
to
be
stopped
for
cleaning
and
this
prevented
our
approaching
it
by
daylight
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
land
at
dusk
which
was
at
all
events
enough
to
check
our
chronometers
south
of
the
degree
of
latitude
the
trade
was
nearly
done
with
and
we
were
really
not
sorry
to
be
rid
of
it
it
remained
light
and
scant
to
the
last
and
sailing
on
a
wind
is
not
a
strong
point
with
the
fram
in
the
part
of
the
ocean
where
we
now
were
there
was
a
hope
of
getting
a
good
wind
and
it
was
wanted
if
we
were
to
come
out
right
we
had
now
covered
miles
but
there
were
still
before
us
and
the
days
went
by
with
astonishing
rapidity
the
end
of
october
brought
the
change
we
wanted
with
a
fresh
northerly
breeze
she
went
gallantly
southward
and
before
the
end
of
the
month
we
were
down
in
lat
here
we
had
reached
the
waters
where
we
were
almost
certain
to
have
all
the
wind
we
wished
and
from
the
right
quarter
from
now
our
course
was
eastward
along
what
is
known
as
the
southern
west
wind
belt
this
belt
extends
between
the
and
parallels
all
round
the
earth
and
is
distinguished
by
the
constant
occurrence
of
westerly
winds
which
as
a
rule
blow
with
great
violence
we
had
put
our
trust
in
these
west
winds
if
they
failed
us
we
should
be
in
a
mess
but
no
sooner
had
we
reached
their
domain
than
they
were
upon
us
with
full
force
it
was
no
gentle
treatment
that
we
received
but
the
effect
was
excellent
we
raced
to
the
eastward
an
intended
call
at
gough
island
had
to
be
abandoned
the
sea
was
running
too
high
for
us
to
venture
to
approach
the
narrow
little
harbour
the
month
of
october
had
put
us
a
good
deal
behindhand
but
now
we
were
making
up
the
distance
we
had
lost
we
had
reckoned
on
being
south
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
within
two
months
after
leaving
madeira
and
this
turned
out
correct
the
day
we
passed
the
meridian
of
the
cape
we
had
the
first
regular
gale
the
seas
ran
threateningly
high
but
now
for
the
first
time
our
splendid
little
ship
showed
what
she
was
worth
a
single
one
of
these
gigantic
waves
would
have
cleared
our
decks
in
an
instant
if
it
had
come
on
board
but
the
fram
did
not
permit
any
such
impertinence
when
they
came
up
behind
the
vessel
and
we
might
expect
at
any
moment
to
see
them
break
over
the
low
she
just
raised
herself
with
an
elegant
movement
and
the
wave
had
to
be
content
with
slipping
underneath
an
albatross
could
not
have
managed
the
situation
better
it
is
said
that
the
fram
was
built
for
the
ice
and
that
can
not
of
course
be
denied
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
certain
that
when
colin
archer
created
his
famous
masterpiece
of
an
ice
boat
she
was
just
as
much
a
masterpiece
of
a
sea
boat
a
vessel
it
would
be
difficult
to
match
for
seaworthiness
to
be
able
to
avoid
the
seas
as
the
fram
did
she
had
to
roll
and
this
we
had
every
opportunity
of
finding
out
the
whole
long
passage
through
the
westerly
belt
was
one
continual
rolling
but
in
course
of
time
one
got
used
even
to
that
discomfort
it
was
awkward
enough
but
less
disagreeable
than
shipping
water
perhaps
it
was
worse
for
those
who
had
to
work
in
the
galley
it
is
no
laughing
matter
to
be
cook
when
for
weeks
together
you
can
not
put
down
so
much
as
a
without
its
immediately
turning
a
somersault
it
requires
both
patience
and
strong
will
to
carry
it
through
but
the
two
lindstrom
and
olsen
who
looked
after
our
food
under
these
difficult
conditions
had
the
gift
of
taking
it
all
from
the
humorous
point
of
view
and
that
was
well
as
regards
the
dogs
it
mattered
little
to
them
whether
a
gale
was
blowing
so
long
as
the
rain
kept
off
they
hate
rain
wet
in
any
form
is
the
worst
one
can
offer
an
arctic
dog
if
the
deck
was
wet
they
would
not
lie
down
but
would
remain
standing
motionless
for
hours
trying
to
take
a
nap
in
that
uncomfortable
position
of
course
they
did
not
get
much
sleep
in
that
way
but
to
make
up
for
it
they
could
sleep
all
day
and
all
night
when
the
weather
was
fine
south
of
the
cape
we
lost
two
dogs
they
went
overboard
one
dark
night
when
the
ship
was
rolling
tremendously
we
had
a
on
the
port
side
of
the
reaching
up
to
the
height
of
the
bulwarks
probably
these
fellows
had
been
practising
boarding
drill
and
lost
their
balance
we
took
precautions
that
the
same
thing
should
not
happen
again
fortunately
for
our
animals
the
weather
in
the
westerly
belt
was
subject
to
very
frequent
changes
no
doubt
they
had
many
a
sleepless
night
with
rain
sleet
and
hail
but
on
the
other
hand
they
never
had
to
wait
very
long
for
a
cheerful
glimpse
of
the
sun
the
wind
is
for
the
most
part
of
cyclonic
character
shifting
suddenly
from
one
quarter
to
another
and
these
shifts
always
involve
a
change
of
weather
when
the
barometer
begins
to
fall
it
is
a
sure
warning
of
an
approaching
wind
which
is
always
accompanied
by
precipitation
and
increases
in
force
until
the
fall
of
the
barometer
ceases
when
this
occurs
there
follows
either
a
short
pause
or
else
the
wind
suddenly
shifts
to
the
and
blows
from
that
quarter
with
increasing
violence
while
the
barometer
rises
rapidly
the
change
of
wind
is
almost
always
followed
by
a
clearing
of
the
weather
a
circumstance
which
contributes
an
element
of
risk
to
navigation
in
the
latitudes
where
we
found
ourselves
is
the
possibility
of
colliding
with
an
iceberg
in
darkness
or
thick
weather
for
it
sometimes
happens
that
these
sinister
monsters
in
the
course
of
their
wanderings
find
their
way
well
up
into
the
forties
the
probability
of
a
collision
is
of
course
in
itself
not
very
great
and
it
can
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
by
taking
proper
precautions
at
night
an
attentive
and
practised
man
will
always
be
able
to
see
the
blink
of
the
ice
at
a
fairly
long
distance
from
the
time
when
we
had
to
reckon
with
any
likelihood
of
meeting
icebergs
the
temperature
of
the
water
was
also
taken
every
two
hours
during
the
night
as
kerguelen
island
lay
almost
directly
in
the
course
we
intended
to
follow
it
was
decided
for
several
reasons
that
we
should
call
there
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
norwegian
latterly
many
of
the
dogs
had
begun
to
grow
thin
and
it
seemed
probable
that
this
was
owing
to
their
not
having
enough
fatty
substances
in
their
food
on
kerguelen
island
there
would
presumably
be
an
opportunity
of
getting
all
the
fat
we
wanted
as
to
water
we
had
it
was
true
just
enough
to
last
us
with
economy
but
it
would
do
no
harm
to
fill
up
the
tanks
i
was
also
hoping
that
there
would
be
a
chance
of
engaging
three
or
four
extra
hands
for
the
fram
would
be
rather
with
only
ten
men
to
sail
her
out
of
the
ice
and
round
the
horn
to
buenos
aires
after
the
rest
of
us
had
been
landed
on
the
barrier
another
reason
for
the
contemplated
visit
was
that
it
would
be
an
agreeable
diversion
we
now
only
had
to
get
there
as
quickly
as
possible
and
the
west
wind
helped
us
splendidly
one
stiff
breeze
succeeded
another
without
our
having
any
excessive
weather
our
daily
distance
at
this
time
amounted
as
a
rule
to
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
one
hours
we
made
one
hundred
and
miles
this
was
our
best
work
of
the
whole
voyage
and
it
is
no
bad
performance
for
a
vessel
like
the
fram
with
her
limited
sail
area
and
her
hull
on
the
afternoon
of
november
we
sighted
land
it
was
only
a
barren
rocky
knoll
and
according
to
our
determination
of
the
position
it
would
be
the
island
called
bligh
cap
which
lies
a
few
miles
north
of
kerguelen
island
but
as
the
weather
was
not
very
clear
and
we
were
unacquainted
with
the
channels
we
preferred
to
for
the
night
before
approaching
any
nearer
early
next
morning
the
weather
cleared
and
we
got
accurate
bearings
a
course
was
laid
for
royal
sound
where
we
supposed
the
to
be
situated
we
were
going
well
in
the
fresh
morning
breeze
and
were
just
about
to
round
the
last
headland
when
all
at
once
a
gale
sprang
up
again
the
bare
and
uninviting
coast
was
hidden
in
heavy
rain
and
we
had
the
choice
of
waiting
for
an
indefinite
time
or
continuing
our
voyage
without
much
hesitation
we
chose
the
latter
alternative
it
might
be
tempting
enough
to
come
in
contact
with
other
men
especially
as
they
were
but
it
was
even
more
tempting
to
have
done
with
the
remaining
miles
that
lay
between
us
and
the
barrier
as
quickly
as
possible
it
turned
out
that
we
had
chosen
rightly
december
brought
us
a
fair
wind
even
fresher
than
that
of
november
and
by
the
middle
of
the
month
we
had
already
covered
half
the
distance
between
kerguelen
island
and
our
goal
we
fortified
the
dogs
from
time
to
time
with
a
liberal
allowance
of
butter
which
had
a
marvellous
effect
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
ourselves
we
were
all
in
the
best
of
health
and
our
spirits
rose
as
we
drew
nearer
our
goal
that
the
state
of
our
health
was
so
remarkably
good
during
the
whole
voyage
must
be
ascribed
in
a
material
degree
to
the
excellence
of
our
provisions
during
the
trip
from
home
to
madeira
we
had
lived
sumptuously
on
some
little
pigs
that
we
took
with
us
but
after
these
luxuries
we
had
to
take
to
tinned
meat
for
good
the
change
was
not
felt
much
as
we
had
excellent
and
palatable
things
with
us
there
was
a
separate
service
for
the
two
cabins
but
the
food
was
precisely
the
same
in
each
breakfast
was
at
eight
consisting
of
american
hot
cakes
with
marmalade
or
jam
cheese
fresh
bread
and
coffee
or
cocoa
dinner
as
a
rule
was
composed
of
one
dish
of
meat
and
sweets
as
has
already
been
said
we
could
not
afford
to
have
soup
regularly
on
account
of
the
water
it
required
and
it
was
only
served
on
sundays
the
second
course
usually
consisted
of
californian
fruit
it
was
our
aim
all
through
to
employ
fruit
vegetables
and
jam
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
there
is
undoubtedly
no
better
means
of
avoiding
sickness
at
dinner
we
always
drank
syrup
and
water
every
wednesday
and
saturday
we
were
treated
to
a
glass
of
spirits
i
knew
from
my
own
experience
how
delicious
a
cup
of
coffee
tastes
when
one
turns
out
to
go
on
watch
at
night
however
sleepy
and
grumpy
one
may
be
a
gulp
of
hot
coffee
quickly
makes
a
better
man
of
one
therefore
coffee
for
the
night
watch
was
a
permanent
institution
on
board
the
fram
by
about
christmas
we
had
reached
nearly
the
meridian
in
lat
this
left
not
much
more
than
miles
before
we
might
expect
to
meet
with
the
our
glorious
west
wind
which
had
driven
us
forward
for
weeks
and
freed
us
from
all
anxiety
about
arriving
too
late
was
now
a
thing
of
the
past
for
a
change
we
again
had
to
contend
for
some
days
with
calms
and
contrary
wind
the
day
before
christmas
eve
brought
rain
and
a
gale
from
the
which
was
not
very
cheerful
if
we
were
to
keep
christmas
with
any
festivity
fine
weather
was
wanted
otherwise
the
everlasting
rolling
would
spoil
all
our
attempts
no
doubt
we
should
all
have
got
over
it
if
it
had
fallen
to
our
lot
to
experience
a
christmas
eve
with
storm
shortened
sail
and
other
delights
worse
things
had
happened
before
on
the
other
hand
there
was
not
one
of
us
who
would
not
be
the
better
for
a
little
comfort
and
relaxation
our
life
had
been
monotonous
and
commonplace
enough
for
a
long
time
but
as
i
said
the
day
before
christmas
eve
was
not
at
all
promising
the
only
sign
of
the
approaching
holiday
was
the
fact
that
lindstrom
in
spite
of
the
rolling
was
busy
baking
christmas
cakes
we
suggested
that
he
might
just
as
well
give
us
each
our
share
at
once
as
it
is
well
known
that
the
cakes
are
best
when
they
come
straight
out
of
the
oven
but
lindstrom
would
not
hear
of
it
his
cakes
vanished
for
the
time
being
under
lock
and
key
and
we
had
to
be
content
with
the
smell
of
them
christmas
eve
arrived
with
finer
weather
and
a
smoother
sea
than
we
had
seen
for
weeks
the
ship
was
perfectly
steady
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
our
making
every
preparation
for
the
festivity
as
the
day
wore
on
christmas
was
in
full
swing
the
was
washed
and
cleaned
up
till
the
ripolin
paint
and
the
brass
shone
with
equal
brilliance
ronne
decorated
the
workroom
with
signal
flags
and
the
good
old
happy
christmas
greeted
us
in
a
transparency
over
the
door
of
the
saloon
inside
nilsen
was
busily
engaged
showing
great
talents
as
a
decorator
the
gramophone
was
rigged
up
in
my
cabin
on
a
board
hung
from
the
ceiling
a
proposed
concert
of
piano
violin
and
mandolin
had
to
be
abandoned
as
the
piano
was
altogether
out
of
tune
the
various
members
of
our
little
community
appeared
one
after
another
dressed
and
tidied
up
so
that
many
of
them
were
scarcely
recognizable
the
stubbly
chins
were
all
smooth
and
that
makes
a
great
difference
at
five
the
engine
was
stopped
and
all
hands
assembled
in
the
leaving
only
the
man
at
the
wheel
on
deck
our
cosy
cabins
had
a
appearance
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
lamps
and
we
were
all
in
the
christmas
humour
at
once
the
decorations
did
honour
to
him
who
had
carried
them
out
and
to
those
who
had
given
us
the
greater
part
of
them
schroer
and
the
proprietor
of
the
oyster
cellar
at
christiania
then
we
took
our
seats
round
the
table
which
groaned
beneath
lindstrom
masterpieces
in
the
culinary
art
i
slipped
behind
the
curtain
of
my
cabin
for
an
instant
and
set
the
gramophone
going
herold
sang
us
glade
jul
the
song
did
not
fail
of
its
effect
it
was
difficult
to
see
in
the
subdued
light
but
i
fancy
that
among
the
band
of
hardy
men
that
sat
round
the
table
there
was
scarcely
one
who
had
not
a
tear
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
thoughts
of
all
took
the
same
direction
i
am
certain
they
flew
homeward
to
the
old
country
in
the
north
and
we
could
wish
nothing
better
than
that
those
we
had
left
behind
should
be
as
well
off
as
ourselves
the
melancholy
feeling
soon
gave
way
to
gaiety
and
laughter
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
the
first
mate
fired
off
a
topical
song
written
by
himself
which
had
an
immense
success
in
each
verse
the
little
weaknesses
of
someone
present
were
exhibited
in
more
or
less
strong
relief
and
in
between
there
were
marginal
remarks
in
prose
both
in
text
and
performance
the
author
fully
attained
the
object
of
his
work
that
of
thoroughly
exercising
our
risible
muscles
in
the
a
was
set
out
on
which
there
was
a
large
assortment
of
lindstrom
christmas
baking
with
a
mighty
kransekake
from
hansen
towering
in
the
midst
while
we
were
doing
all
possible
honour
to
these
luxuries
lindstrom
was
busily
engaged
forward
and
when
we
went
back
after
our
coffee
we
found
there
a
beautiful
in
all
its
glory
the
tree
was
an
artificial
one
but
so
perfectly
imitated
that
it
might
have
come
straight
from
the
forest
this
was
also
a
present
from
schroer
then
came
the
distribution
of
christmas
presents
among
the
many
kind
friends
who
had
thought
of
us
i
must
mention
the
committees
in
horten
and
fredrikstad
and
the
telephone
employees
of
christiania
they
all
have
a
claim
to
our
warmest
gratitude
for
the
share
they
had
in
making
our
christmas
what
it
was
a
bright
memory
of
the
long
voyage
by
ten
in
the
evening
the
candles
of
the
were
burnt
out
and
the
festivity
was
at
an
end
it
had
been
successful
from
first
to
last
and
we
all
had
something
to
live
on
in
our
thoughts
when
our
everyday
duties
again
claimed
us
in
that
part
of
the
voyage
which
we
now
had
before
us
the
region
between
the
australian
continent
and
the
antarctic
belt
of
we
were
prepared
for
all
sorts
of
trials
in
the
way
of
unfavourable
weather
conditions
we
had
read
and
heard
so
much
of
what
others
had
had
to
face
in
these
waters
that
we
involuntarily
connected
them
with
all
the
horrors
that
may
befall
a
sailor
not
that
we
had
a
fear
for
the
ship
we
knew
her
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
it
would
take
some
very
extraordinary
weather
to
do
her
any
harm
if
we
were
afraid
of
anything
it
was
of
delay
but
we
were
spared
either
delay
or
any
other
trouble
by
noon
on
christmas
day
we
had
just
what
was
wanted
to
keep
our
spirits
at
festival
pitch
a
fresh
wind
just
strong
enough
to
push
us
along
handsomely
toward
our
destination
it
afterwards
hauled
a
little
more
to
the
west
and
lasted
the
greater
part
of
christmas
week
until
on
december
we
were
in
long
and
lat
with
that
we
had
at
last
come
far
enough
to
the
east
and
could
now
begin
to
steer
a
southerly
course
hardly
had
we
put
the
helm
over
before
the
wind
changed
to
a
stiff
northerly
breeze
nothing
could
possibly
be
better
in
this
way
it
would
not
take
us
long
to
dispose
of
the
remaining
degrees
of
latitude
our
faithful
companions
of
the
westerly
belt
the
albatrosses
had
now
disappeared
and
we
could
soon
begin
to
look
out
for
the
first
representatives
of
the
winged
inhabitants
of
antarctica
after
a
careful
consideration
of
the
experiences
of
our
predecessors
it
was
decided
to
lay
our
course
so
that
we
should
cross
the
parallel
in
long
what
we
had
to
do
was
to
get
as
quickly
as
possible
through
the
belt
of
that
blocked
the
way
to
ross
sea
to
the
south
of
it
which
is
always
open
in
summer
some
ships
had
been
detained
as
much
as
six
weeks
in
this
belt
of
ice
others
had
gone
through
in
a
few
hours
we
unhesitatingly
preferred
to
follow
the
latter
example
and
therefore
took
the
course
that
the
luckier
ones
had
indicated
of
course
the
width
of
the
may
be
subject
to
somewhat
fortuitous
changes
but
it
seems
nevertheless
that
as
a
rule
the
region
between
the
and
the
degrees
of
longitude
offers
the
best
chance
of
getting
through
rapidly
in
any
case
one
ought
not
to
enter
the
ice
farther
to
the
west
at
noon
on
new
year
eve
we
were
in
lat
we
had
reached
the
end
of
the
old
year
and
really
it
had
gone
incredibly
quickly
like
all
its
predecessors
the
year
had
brought
its
share
of
success
and
failure
but
the
main
thing
was
that
at
its
close
we
found
ourselves
pretty
nearly
where
we
ought
to
be
to
make
good
our
calculations
and
all
safe
and
well
conscious
of
this
we
said
to
in
all
friendliness
over
a
good
glass
of
toddy
in
the
evening
and
wished
each
other
all
possible
luck
in
at
three
in
the
morning
of
new
year
day
the
officer
of
the
watch
called
me
with
news
that
the
first
iceberg
was
in
sight
i
had
to
go
up
and
see
it
yes
there
it
lay
far
to
windward
shining
like
a
castle
in
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
it
was
a
big
berg
of
the
typical
antarctic
form
it
will
perhaps
seem
paradoxical
when
i
say
that
we
all
greeted
this
first
sight
of
the
ice
with
satisfaction
and
joy
an
iceberg
is
usually
the
last
thing
to
gladden
sailors
hearts
but
we
were
not
looking
at
the
risk
just
then
the
meeting
with
the
imposing
colossus
had
another
significance
that
had
a
stronger
claim
on
our
interest
the
could
not
be
far
off
we
were
all
longing
as
one
man
to
be
in
it
it
would
be
a
grand
variation
in
the
monotonous
life
we
had
led
for
so
long
and
which
we
were
beginning
to
be
a
little
tired
of
merely
to
be
able
to
run
a
few
yards
on
an
appeared
to
us
an
event
of
importance
and
we
rejoiced
no
less
at
the
prospect
of
giving
our
dogs
a
good
meal
of
seal
flesh
while
we
ourselves
would
have
no
objection
to
a
little
change
of
diet
the
number
of
icebergs
increased
during
the
afternoon
and
night
and
with
such
neighbours
it
suited
us
very
well
to
have
daylight
all
through
the
hours
as
we
now
had
the
weather
could
not
have
been
better
fine
and
clear
with
a
light
but
still
favourable
wind
at
on
january
the
antarctic
circle
was
crossed
and
an
hour
or
two
later
the
was
able
to
report
the
ahead
for
the
time
being
it
did
not
look
like
obstructing
us
to
any
great
extent
the
floes
were
collected
in
long
lines
with
broad
channels
of
open
water
between
them
we
steered
right
in
our
position
was
then
long
and
lat
the
ice
immediately
stopped
all
swell
the
vessel
deck
again
became
a
stable
platform
and
after
two
months
incessant
exercise
of
our
we
could
once
more
move
about
freely
that
was
a
treat
in
itself
at
nine
in
the
morning
of
the
next
day
we
had
our
first
opportunity
of
a
big
weddell
seal
was
observed
on
a
floe
right
ahead
it
took
our
approach
with
the
utmost
calmness
not
thinking
it
worth
while
to
budge
an
inch
until
a
couple
of
had
convinced
it
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
it
then
made
an
attempt
to
reach
the
water
but
it
was
too
late
two
men
were
already
on
the
floe
and
the
valuable
spoil
was
secured
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
beast
lay
on
our
deck
flayed
and
cut
up
by
practised
hands
this
gave
us
at
one
stroke
at
least
four
hundredweight
of
dog
food
as
well
as
a
good
many
rations
for
men
we
made
the
same
coup
three
times
more
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
thus
had
over
a
ton
of
fresh
meat
and
blubber
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
there
was
a
great
feast
on
board
that
day
the
dogs
did
their
utmost
to
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
they
simply
ate
till
their
legs
would
no
longer
carry
them
and
we
could
grant
them
this
gratification
with
a
good
conscience
as
to
ourselves
it
may
doubtless
be
taken
for
granted
that
we
observed
some
degree
of
moderation
but
dinner
was
polished
off
very
quickly
seal
steak
had
many
ardent
adherents
already
and
it
very
soon
gained
more
seal
soup
in
which
our
excellent
vegetables
showed
to
advantage
was
perhaps
even
more
favourably
received
for
the
first
hours
after
we
entered
the
ice
it
was
so
loose
that
we
were
able
to
hold
our
course
and
keep
up
our
speed
for
practically
the
whole
time
on
the
two
following
days
things
did
not
go
quite
so
smoothly
at
times
the
lines
of
floes
were
fairly
close
and
occasionally
we
had
to
go
round
we
did
not
meet
with
any
considerable
obstruction
however
there
were
always
openings
enough
to
enable
us
to
keep
going
in
the
course
of
january
a
change
took
place
the
floes
became
narrower
and
the
leads
broader
by
there
was
open
sea
on
every
side
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
observations
gave
our
position
as
lat
long
our
passage
through
the
pack
had
been
a
four
days
pleasure
trip
and
i
have
a
suspicion
that
several
among
us
looked
back
with
secret
regret
to
the
cruise
in
smooth
water
through
the
when
the
swell
of
the
open
ross
sea
gave
the
fram
another
chance
of
showing
her
rolling
capabilities
but
this
last
part
of
the
voyage
was
also
to
be
favoured
by
fortune
these
comparatively
waters
had
no
terrors
to
oppose
to
us
the
weather
continued
surprisingly
fine
it
could
not
have
been
better
on
a
summer
trip
in
the
north
sea
of
icebergs
there
was
practically
none
a
few
quite
small
floebergs
were
all
we
met
with
in
the
four
days
we
took
to
cross
ross
sea
about
midday
on
january
a
marked
brightening
of
the
southern
sky
announced
that
it
was
not
far
to
the
goal
we
had
been
struggling
to
reach
for
five
months
at
we
came
in
sight
of
the
great
ice
barrier
slowly
it
rose
up
out
of
the
sea
until
we
were
face
to
face
with
it
in
all
its
imposing
majesty
it
is
difficult
with
the
help
of
the
pen
to
give
any
idea
of
the
impression
this
mighty
wall
of
ice
makes
on
the
observer
who
is
confronted
with
it
for
the
first
time
it
is
altogether
a
thing
which
can
hardly
be
described
but
one
can
understand
very
well
that
this
wall
of
feet
in
height
was
regarded
for
a
generation
as
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
further
southward
progress
we
knew
that
the
theory
of
the
barrier
impregnability
had
long
ago
been
overthrown
there
was
an
opening
to
the
unknown
realm
beyond
it
this
opening
the
bay
of
whales
ought
to
lie
according
to
the
descriptions
before
us
about
a
hundred
miles
to
the
east
of
the
position
in
which
we
were
our
course
was
altered
to
true
east
and
during
a
cruise
of
hours
along
the
barrier
we
had
every
opportunity
of
marvelling
at
this
gigantic
work
of
nature
it
was
not
without
a
certain
feeling
of
suspense
that
we
looked
forward
to
our
arrival
at
the
harbour
we
were
seeking
what
state
should
we
find
it
in
would
it
prove
impossible
to
land
at
all
conveniently
one
point
after
another
was
passed
but
still
our
anxious
eyes
were
met
by
nothing
but
the
perpendicular
wall
at
last
on
the
afternoon
of
january
the
wall
opened
this
agreed
with
our
expectations
we
were
now
in
long
the
selfsame
point
where
our
predecessors
had
previously
found
access
we
had
before
us
a
great
bay
so
deep
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
end
of
it
from
the
but
for
the
moment
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
in
the
bay
was
full
of
great
floes
recently
broken
up
we
therefore
went
on
a
little
farther
to
the
eastward
to
await
developments
next
morning
we
returned
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
hours
the
floes
within
the
bay
began
to
move
one
after
another
they
came
sailing
out
the
passage
was
soon
free
as
we
steered
up
the
bay
we
soon
saw
clearly
that
here
we
had
every
chance
of
effecting
a
landing
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
choose
the
best
place
chapter
v
on
the
barrier
we
had
thus
arrived
on
january
a
day
earlier
than
we
had
reckoned
at
this
vast
mysterious
natural
phenomenon
the
barrier
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
of
the
expedition
was
solved
that
of
conveying
our
draught
animals
in
sound
condition
to
the
field
of
operations
we
had
taken
dogs
on
board
at
christiansand
the
number
had
now
increased
to
and
practically
all
of
these
would
be
fit
to
serve
in
the
final
march
to
the
south
the
next
great
problem
that
confronted
us
was
to
find
a
suitable
place
on
the
barrier
for
our
station
my
idea
had
been
to
get
everything
equipment
and
provisions
conveyed
far
enough
into
the
barrier
to
secure
us
against
the
unpleasant
possibility
of
drifting
out
into
the
pacific
in
case
the
barrier
should
be
inclined
to
calve
i
had
therefore
fixed
upon
ten
miles
as
a
suitable
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
barrier
but
even
our
first
impression
of
the
conditions
seemed
to
show
that
we
should
be
spared
a
great
part
of
this
long
and
troublesome
transport
along
its
outer
edge
the
barrier
shows
an
even
flat
surface
but
here
inside
the
bay
the
conditions
were
entirely
different
even
from
the
deck
of
the
fram
we
were
able
to
observe
great
disturbances
of
the
surface
in
every
direction
huge
ridges
with
hollows
between
them
extended
on
all
sides
the
greatest
elevation
lay
to
the
south
in
the
form
of
a
lofty
arched
ridge
which
we
took
to
be
about
feet
high
on
the
horizon
but
it
might
be
assumed
that
this
ridge
continued
to
rise
beyond
the
range
of
vision
our
original
hypothesis
that
this
bay
was
due
to
underlying
land
seemed
therefore
to
be
immediately
confirmed
it
did
not
take
long
to
moor
the
vessel
to
the
fixed
which
here
extended
for
about
a
mile
and
a
quarter
beyond
the
edge
of
the
barrier
everything
had
been
got
ready
long
before
bjaaland
had
put
our
ski
in
order
and
every
man
had
had
his
right
pairs
fitted
had
long
ago
been
tried
on
time
after
time
sometimes
with
one
sometimes
with
two
pairs
of
stockings
of
course
it
turned
out
that
the
were
on
the
small
side
to
get
a
bootmaker
to
make
roomy
boots
is
i
believe
an
absolute
impossibility
however
with
two
pairs
of
stockings
we
could
always
get
along
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ship
for
longer
journeys
we
had
canvas
boots
as
already
mentioned
of
the
remainder
of
our
outfit
i
need
only
mention
the
alpine
ropes
which
had
also
been
ready
for
some
time
they
were
about
yards
long
and
were
made
of
very
fine
rope
soft
as
silk
specially
suited
for
use
in
low
temperatures
after
a
hurried
dinner
four
of
us
set
out
this
first
excursion
was
quite
a
solemn
affair
so
much
depended
on
it
the
weather
was
of
the
very
best
calm
with
brilliant
sunshine
and
a
few
light
feathery
clouds
in
the
beautiful
pale
blue
sky
there
was
warmth
in
the
air
which
could
be
felt
even
on
this
immense
seals
were
lying
along
the
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
great
fat
mountains
of
flesh
food
enough
to
last
us
and
the
dogs
for
years
the
going
was
ideal
our
ski
glided
easily
and
pleasantly
through
the
newly
fallen
loose
snow
but
none
of
us
was
exactly
in
training
after
the
long
five
months
sea
voyage
so
that
the
pace
was
not
great
after
half
an
hour
march
we
were
already
at
the
first
important
point
the
connection
between
the
and
the
barrier
this
connection
had
always
haunted
our
brains
what
would
it
be
like
a
high
perpendicular
face
of
ice
up
which
we
should
have
to
haul
our
things
laboriously
with
the
help
of
tackles
or
a
great
and
dangerous
fissure
which
we
should
not
be
able
to
cross
without
going
a
long
way
round
we
naturally
expected
something
of
the
sort
this
mighty
and
terrible
monster
would
of
course
offer
resistance
in
some
form
or
other
the
mystic
barrier
all
accounts
without
exception
from
the
days
of
ross
to
the
present
time
had
spoken
of
this
remarkable
natural
formation
with
apprehensive
awe
it
was
as
though
one
could
always
read
between
the
lines
the
same
sentence
hush
be
quiet
the
mystic
barrier
one
two
three
and
a
little
jump
and
the
barrier
was
surmounted
we
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
probably
the
same
thought
was
in
the
minds
of
all
of
us
the
monster
had
begun
to
lose
something
of
its
mystery
the
terror
something
of
its
force
the
incomprehensible
was
becoming
quite
easy
to
understand
without
striking
a
blow
we
had
entered
into
our
kingdom
the
barrier
was
at
this
spot
about
feet
high
and
the
junction
between
it
and
the
was
completely
filled
up
with
driven
snow
so
that
the
ascent
took
the
form
of
a
little
gentle
slope
this
spot
would
certainly
offer
us
no
resistance
hitherto
we
had
made
our
advance
without
a
rope
the
we
knew
would
offer
no
hidden
difficulties
but
what
would
be
the
condition
of
things
beyond
the
barrier
was
another
question
and
as
we
all
thought
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
rope
on
before
we
fell
into
a
crevasse
than
afterwards
our
further
advance
was
made
with
a
rope
between
the
first
two
we
proceeded
in
an
easterly
direction
up
through
a
little
valley
formed
by
mount
nelson
on
one
side
and
mount
ronniken
on
the
other
the
reader
must
not
however
imagine
from
these
imposing
names
that
we
were
walking
between
any
formidable
mounts
nelson
and
ronniken
were
nothing
but
two
old
pressure
ridges
that
had
been
formed
in
those
days
when
the
mighty
mass
of
ice
had
pushed
on
with
awful
force
without
meeting
hindrance
or
resistance
until
at
this
spot
it
met
a
superior
power
that
clove
and
splintered
it
and
set
a
bound
to
its
further
advance
it
must
have
been
a
frightful
collision
like
the
end
of
a
world
but
now
it
was
over
peace
an
air
of
infinite
peace
lay
over
it
all
nelson
and
ronniken
were
only
two
pensioned
veterans
regarded
as
pressure
ridges
they
were
huge
raising
their
highest
summits
over
feet
in
the
air
here
in
the
valley
the
surface
round
nelson
was
quite
filled
up
while
ronniken
still
showed
a
deep
scar
a
fissure
or
hollow
we
approached
it
cautiously
it
was
not
easy
to
see
how
deep
it
was
and
whether
it
had
an
invisible
connection
with
nelson
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
but
this
was
not
the
case
on
a
closer
examination
this
deep
cleft
proved
to
have
a
solid
bottom
between
the
ridges
the
surface
was
perfectly
flat
and
offered
an
excellent
site
for
a
captain
nilsen
and
i
had
worked
out
a
kind
of
programme
of
the
work
to
be
done
and
in
this
it
was
decided
that
the
dogs
should
be
brought
on
to
the
barrier
as
quickly
as
possible
and
there
looked
after
by
two
men
we
chose
this
place
for
the
purpose
the
old
pressure
ridges
told
the
history
of
the
spot
plainly
enough
we
had
no
need
to
fear
any
kind
of
disturbance
here
the
site
had
the
additional
advantage
that
we
could
see
the
ship
from
it
and
would
always
be
in
communication
with
those
on
board
from
here
the
valley
turned
slightly
to
the
south
after
having
marked
the
spot
where
our
first
tent
was
to
be
set
up
we
continued
our
investigations
the
valley
sloped
gradually
upwards
and
reached
the
ridge
at
a
height
of
feet
from
this
elevation
we
had
an
excellent
view
over
the
valley
we
had
been
following
and
all
the
other
surroundings
on
the
north
the
barrier
extended
level
and
straight
apparently
without
interruption
and
ended
on
the
west
in
the
steep
descent
of
cape
man
head
which
formed
the
eastern
limit
of
the
inner
part
of
the
bay
of
whales
and
afforded
a
snug
little
corner
where
we
had
found
room
for
our
ship
there
lay
the
whole
of
the
inner
part
of
the
bay
bounded
on
all
sides
by
ice
ice
and
nothing
but
as
far
as
we
could
see
white
and
blue
this
spot
would
no
doubt
show
a
surprising
play
of
colour
later
on
it
promised
well
in
this
way
the
ridge
we
were
standing
on
was
not
broad
about
two
hundred
yards
i
think
and
in
many
places
it
was
swept
quite
bare
by
the
wind
showing
the
blue
ice
itself
we
passed
over
it
and
made
for
the
pass
of
thermopylae
which
extended
in
a
southerly
direction
from
the
ridge
and
after
a
very
slight
descent
was
merged
in
a
great
plain
surrounded
by
elevations
on
all
sides
a
basin
in
fact
the
bare
ridge
we
passed
over
to
descend
into
the
basin
was
a
good
deal
broken
up
but
the
fissures
were
narrow
and
almost
entirely
filled
up
again
with
drift
so
that
they
were
not
dangerous
the
basin
gave
us
the
impression
of
being
sheltered
and
cosy
and
above
all
it
looked
safe
and
secure
this
stretch
of
ice
was
with
the
exception
of
a
few
quite
small
hummocks
of
the
shape
of
haycocks
perfectly
flat
and
free
from
crevasses
we
crossed
it
and
went
up
on
the
ridge
that
rose
very
gently
on
the
south
from
the
top
of
this
all
was
flat
and
even
as
far
as
we
could
see
but
that
was
not
saying
much
for
a
little
while
we
continued
along
the
ridge
in
an
easterly
direction
without
finding
any
place
that
was
specially
suited
for
our
purpose
our
thoughts
returned
to
the
basin
as
the
best
sheltered
place
we
had
seen
from
the
height
we
were
now
on
we
could
look
down
into
the
part
of
the
bay
of
whales
in
contrast
to
that
part
of
the
to
which
we
had
made
fast
the
inner
bay
seemed
to
consist
of
ice
that
had
been
forced
up
by
pressure
but
we
had
to
leave
a
closer
examination
of
this
part
till
later
we
all
liked
the
basin
and
agreed
to
choose
it
as
our
future
abode
and
so
we
turned
and
went
back
again
it
did
not
take
long
to
reach
the
plain
in
our
own
tracks
on
making
a
thorough
examination
of
the
surface
and
discussing
the
various
possibilities
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
site
for
the
hut
was
to
be
looked
for
on
the
little
elevation
that
rose
to
the
east
it
seemed
that
we
should
be
more
snug
there
than
anywhere
else
and
we
were
not
mistaken
we
soon
made
up
our
minds
that
we
had
chosen
the
best
place
the
barrier
had
to
offer
on
the
spot
where
the
hut
was
to
stand
we
set
up
another
and
then
went
home
the
good
news
that
we
had
already
found
a
favourable
place
for
the
hut
naturally
caused
great
satisfaction
on
all
sides
everyone
had
been
silently
dreading
the
long
and
troublesome
transport
over
the
ice
barrier
there
was
teeming
life
on
the
ice
wherever
we
turned
we
saw
great
herds
of
seals
weddells
and
the
great
which
we
had
seen
occasionally
on
the
floes
was
not
to
be
found
here
during
our
whole
stay
in
the
bay
of
whales
we
did
not
see
a
single
specimen
of
it
nor
did
we
ever
see
the
ross
seal
penguins
had
not
shown
themselves
particularly
often
only
a
few
here
and
there
but
we
appreciated
them
all
the
more
the
few
we
saw
were
almost
all
adelie
penguins
while
we
were
at
work
making
the
ship
fast
a
flock
of
them
suddenly
shot
up
out
of
the
water
and
on
to
the
ice
they
looked
about
them
in
surprise
for
a
moment
men
and
ships
do
not
come
their
way
every
day
but
it
seemed
as
if
their
astonishment
soon
gave
way
to
a
desire
to
see
what
was
happening
they
positively
sat
and
studied
all
our
movements
only
now
and
then
they
grunted
a
little
and
took
a
turn
over
the
ice
what
specially
interested
them
was
evidently
our
work
at
digging
holes
in
the
snow
for
the
grapnels
they
flocked
about
the
men
who
were
engaged
in
this
laid
their
heads
on
one
side
and
looked
as
if
they
found
it
immensely
interesting
they
did
not
appear
to
be
the
least
afraid
of
us
and
for
the
most
part
we
left
them
in
peace
but
some
of
them
had
to
lose
their
lives
we
wanted
them
for
our
collection
an
exciting
took
place
the
same
day
three
had
ventured
to
approach
the
ship
and
were
marked
down
to
increase
our
store
of
fresh
meat
we
picked
two
mighty
hunters
to
secure
the
prey
for
us
they
approached
with
the
greatest
caution
though
this
was
altogether
unnecessary
for
the
seals
lay
perfectly
motionless
they
crept
forward
in
indian
fashion
with
their
heads
down
and
their
backs
bent
this
looks
fine
i
chuckle
and
laugh
but
still
with
a
certain
decorum
then
there
is
a
report
two
of
the
sleeping
seals
give
a
little
spasm
and
do
not
move
again
it
is
otherwise
with
the
third
with
snakelike
movements
it
wriggles
away
through
the
loose
snow
with
surprising
speed
it
is
no
longer
target
practice
but
hunting
real
game
and
the
result
is
in
keeping
with
it
bang
bang
and
bang
again
it
is
a
good
thing
we
have
plenty
of
ammunition
one
of
the
hunters
uses
up
all
his
cartridges
and
has
to
go
back
but
the
other
sets
off
in
pursuit
of
the
game
oh
how
i
laughed
decorum
was
no
longer
possible
i
simply
shook
with
laughter
away
they
went
through
the
loose
snow
the
seal
first
and
the
hunter
after
i
could
see
by
the
movements
of
the
pursuer
that
he
was
furious
he
saw
that
he
was
in
for
something
which
he
could
not
come
out
of
with
dignity
the
seal
made
off
at
such
a
pace
that
it
filled
the
air
with
snow
although
the
snow
was
fairly
deep
and
loose
the
seal
kept
on
the
surface
not
so
the
hunter
he
sank
over
the
knees
at
every
step
and
in
a
short
time
was
completely
outdistanced
from
time
to
time
he
halted
aimed
and
fired
he
himself
afterwards
asserted
that
every
shot
had
hit
i
had
my
doubts
in
any
case
the
seal
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
them
for
it
went
on
with
undiminished
speed
at
last
the
mighty
man
gave
up
and
turned
back
beastly
hard
to
kill
i
heard
him
say
as
he
came
on
board
i
suppressed
a
smile
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
fellow
feelings
what
an
evening
the
sun
is
high
in
the
heavens
in
spite
of
the
late
hour
over
all
this
mountainous
land
of
ice
over
the
mighty
barrier
running
south
there
lies
a
bright
white
shining
light
so
intense
that
it
dazzles
the
eyes
but
northward
lies
the
night
leaden
grey
upon
the
sea
it
passes
into
deep
blue
as
the
eye
is
raised
and
pales
by
degrees
until
it
is
swallowed
up
in
the
radiant
gleam
from
the
barrier
what
lies
behind
the
night
that
mass
we
know
that
part
we
have
explored
and
have
come
off
victorious
but
what
does
the
dazzling
day
to
the
south
conceal
inviting
and
attractive
the
fair
one
lies
before
us
yes
we
hear
you
calling
and
we
shall
come
you
shall
have
your
kiss
if
we
pay
for
it
with
our
lives
the
following
day
sunday
brought
the
same
fine
weather
of
course
there
could
now
be
no
thought
of
sunday
for
us
not
one
of
us
would
have
cared
to
spend
the
day
in
idleness
we
were
now
divided
into
two
parties
the
sea
party
and
the
land
party
the
sea
party
ten
men
took
over
the
fram
while
on
this
day
the
land
party
took
up
their
abode
on
the
barrier
for
a
year
or
two
or
whatever
it
might
be
the
sea
party
was
composed
of
nilsen
gjertsen
beck
sundbeck
ludvig
hansen
kristensen
ronne
nodtvedt
kutschin
and
olsen
the
land
party
consisted
of
prestrud
johansen
helmer
hanssen
hassel
bjaaland
stubberud
lindstrom
and
myself
lindstrom
was
to
stay
on
board
for
a
few
days
longer
as
we
still
had
to
take
most
of
our
meals
on
the
ship
the
plan
was
that
one
party
composed
of
six
men
should
camp
in
a
tent
in
the
space
between
ronniken
and
nelson
while
another
party
of
two
were
to
live
in
a
tent
up
at
the
but
site
and
build
the
hut
the
two
last
were
of
course
our
capable
carpenters
bjaaland
and
stubberud
by
eleven
in
the
morning
we
were
at
last
ready
to
start
we
had
one
sledge
eight
dogs
and
provisions
and
equipment
weighing
altogether
pounds
it
was
my
team
that
was
to
open
the
ball
the
sea
party
had
all
collected
on
deck
to
witness
the
first
start
all
was
now
ready
after
countless
efforts
on
our
part
or
if
it
is
preferred
after
a
thorough
thrashing
for
every
dog
we
had
at
last
got
them
in
a
line
before
the
sledge
in
alaska
harness
with
a
flourish
and
a
crack
of
the
whip
we
set
off
i
glanced
at
the
ship
yes
as
i
thought
all
our
comrades
were
standing
in
a
row
admiring
the
fine
start
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
did
not
hold
my
head
rather
high
and
look
round
with
a
certain
air
of
triumph
if
i
did
so
it
was
foolish
of
me
i
ought
to
have
waited
the
defeat
would
have
been
easier
to
bear
for
defeat
it
was
and
a
signal
one
the
dogs
had
spent
half
a
year
in
lying
about
and
eating
and
drinking
and
had
got
the
impression
that
they
would
never
have
anything
else
to
do
not
one
of
them
appeared
to
understand
that
a
new
era
of
toil
had
begun
after
moving
forward
a
few
yards
they
all
sat
down
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
and
stared
at
each
other
the
most
undisguised
astonishment
could
be
read
in
their
faces
when
at
last
we
had
succeeded
with
another
dose
of
the
whip
in
making
them
understand
that
we
really
asked
them
to
work
instead
of
doing
as
they
were
told
they
flew
at
each
other
in
a
furious
scrimmage
heaven
help
me
what
work
we
had
with
those
eight
dogs
that
day
if
it
was
going
to
be
like
this
on
the
way
to
the
pole
i
calculated
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
that
it
would
take
exactly
a
year
to
get
there
without
counting
the
return
journey
during
all
this
confusion
i
stole
another
glance
at
the
ship
but
the
sight
that
met
me
made
me
quickly
withdraw
my
eyes
again
they
were
simply
shrieking
with
laughter
and
loud
shouts
of
the
most
infamous
encouragement
reached
us
if
you
go
on
like
that
you
get
there
by
christmas
or
well
done
stick
to
it
now
you
off
we
were
stuck
faster
than
ever
things
looked
desperate
at
last
with
the
combined
strength
of
all
the
animals
and
men
we
got
the
sledge
to
move
again
so
our
first
sledge
trip
could
not
be
called
a
triumph
we
then
set
up
our
first
tent
on
the
barrier
between
mounts
nelson
and
ronniken
a
large
strong
tent
for
sixteen
men
with
the
sheet
for
the
floor
sewed
on
round
the
tent
wire
ropes
were
stretched
in
a
triangle
fifty
yards
on
each
side
to
these
the
dogs
were
to
be
tethered
the
tent
was
furnished
with
five
and
a
quantity
of
provisions
the
distance
we
had
come
was
geographical
miles
or
kilometres
measured
by
after
finishing
this
work
we
went
on
up
to
the
site
selected
for
the
station
here
we
set
up
the
tent
a
similar
tent
to
the
other
for
sixteen
men
for
the
use
of
the
carpenters
and
marked
out
the
hut
site
according
to
the
lie
of
the
ground
we
elected
to
make
the
house
face
east
and
west
and
not
north
and
south
as
one
might
have
been
tempted
to
do
since
it
was
usually
supposed
that
the
most
frequent
and
violent
winds
came
from
the
south
we
chose
rightly
the
prevailing
wind
was
from
the
east
and
thus
caught
our
house
on
its
most
protected
short
wall
the
door
faced
west
when
this
work
was
done
we
marked
out
the
way
from
here
to
the
encampment
below
and
thence
to
the
vessel
with
dark
flags
at
every
fifteen
paces
in
this
way
we
should
be
able
to
drive
with
certainty
from
one
place
to
another
without
losing
time
if
a
storm
should
set
in
the
distance
from
the
hut
site
to
the
vessel
was
geographical
miles
or
kilometres
on
monday
january
work
began
in
earnest
about
eighty
dogs
six
teams
drove
up
to
the
first
encampment
with
all
the
provisions
and
equipment
that
could
be
loaded
on
the
sledges
and
twenty
dogs
stubberud
and
bjaaland
teams
went
with
a
full
load
up
to
the
other
camp
we
had
some
work
indeed
those
first
days
to
get
the
dogs
to
obey
us
time
after
time
they
tried
to
take
the
command
from
their
masters
and
steer
their
own
course
more
than
once
it
cost
us
a
wet
shirt
to
convince
them
that
we
really
were
the
masters
it
was
strenuous
work
but
it
succeeded
in
the
end
poor
dogs
they
got
plenty
of
thrashing
in
those
days
our
hours
were
long
we
seldom
turned
in
before
eleven
at
night
and
were
up
again
at
five
but
it
did
not
seem
particularly
hard
we
were
all
alike
eager
for
the
work
to
be
finished
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
the
fram
might
get
away
the
harbour
arrangements
were
not
of
the
best
the
quay
she
was
moored
to
suddenly
broke
in
pieces
and
all
hands
had
to
turn
out
to
make
her
fast
to
a
new
quay
perhaps
they
had
just
got
to
sleep
again
when
the
same
operation
had
to
be
repeated
for
the
ice
broke
time
after
time
and
kept
the
unfortunate
in
constant
activity
it
is
enervating
work
being
always
at
one
post
and
sleeping
with
one
eye
open
they
had
a
hard
time
to
contend
with
our
ten
comrades
and
the
calm
way
in
which
they
took
everything
was
extraordinary
they
were
always
in
a
good
humour
and
always
had
a
joke
ready
it
was
the
duty
of
the
sea
party
to
bring
up
all
the
provisions
and
outfit
for
the
wintering
party
from
the
hold
and
put
them
on
the
ice
then
the
land
party
removed
them
this
work
proceeded
very
smoothly
and
it
was
rare
that
one
party
had
to
wait
for
the
other
during
the
first
few
days
of
sledging
all
the
members
of
the
land
party
became
quite
hoarse
some
of
them
so
badly
that
they
almost
lost
their
voices
this
came
from
the
continual
yelling
and
shouting
that
we
had
to
do
at
first
to
make
the
dogs
go
but
this
gave
the
sea
party
a
welcome
opportunity
of
finding
us
a
nickname
we
were
called
the
chatterers
apart
from
the
unpleasantness
of
constantly
changing
the
anchorage
on
account
of
the
breaking
up
and
drifting
out
of
the
ice
the
harbour
must
in
other
respects
be
regarded
as
very
good
a
little
swell
might
set
in
from
time
to
time
and
cause
some
disagreeable
bumping
but
never
anything
to
embarrass
the
vessel
one
very
great
advantage
was
that
the
currents
in
this
corner
always
set
outward
and
thus
kept
off
all
icebergs
the
sledging
between
the
ship
and
the
barrier
was
done
by
five
men
to
begin
with
as
the
carpenters
were
engaged
in
building
the
house
one
man
had
also
to
be
told
off
as
tent
guard
for
we
could
not
use
more
than
half
our
teams
six
dogs
at
a
time
if
we
harnessed
the
full
team
of
twelve
we
only
had
trouble
and
fights
the
dogs
which
were
thus
left
behind
had
to
be
looked
after
and
a
man
was
required
for
this
duty
another
of
the
duties
of
the
tent
guard
was
to
cook
the
day
food
and
keep
the
tent
tidy
it
was
a
coveted
position
and
lots
were
cast
for
it
it
gave
a
little
variety
in
the
continual
sledging
on
january
the
carpenters
began
to
dig
the
foundations
of
the
house
the
effect
of
all
we
had
heard
about
the
antarctic
storms
was
that
we
decided
to
take
every
possible
precaution
to
make
the
house
stand
on
an
even
keel
the
carpenters
therefore
began
by
digging
a
foundation
feet
down
into
the
barrier
this
was
not
easy
work
feet
below
the
surface
they
came
upon
hard
smooth
ice
and
had
to
use
pickaxes
the
same
day
a
stiff
easterly
breeze
sprang
up
whirling
the
snow
high
into
the
air
and
filling
up
the
foundations
as
fast
as
the
men
dug
them
but
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
stop
those
fellows
in
their
work
they
built
a
of
planks
and
did
it
so
well
that
they
were
able
to
work
all
day
unhindered
by
drifts
until
when
evening
came
they
had
the
whole
foundation
dug
out
there
is
no
difficulty
in
doing
good
work
when
one
has
such
people
to
work
for
one
the
stormy
weather
interfered
somewhat
with
our
sledging
and
as
we
found
our
alaska
harness
unsuitable
to
the
conditions
we
went
on
board
and
began
the
preparation
of
greenland
harness
for
our
dogs
all
hands
worked
at
it
our
excellent
sailmaker
ronne
sewed
sets
of
harness
in
the
course
of
the
month
the
rest
of
us
spliced
the
ropes
and
made
the
necessary
tackles
while
others
spliced
shafts
to
our
sledges
when
evening
came
we
had
an
entirely
new
set
of
tackle
for
all
our
sledges
and
dogs
this
was
very
successful
and
in
a
few
days
the
whole
was
working
smoothly
we
had
now
divided
ourselves
between
the
two
tents
so
that
five
men
slept
in
the
lower
tent
while
the
two
carpenters
and
i
inhabited
the
upper
one
that
evening
a
rather
amusing
thing
happened
to
us
we
were
just
turning
in
when
suddenly
we
heard
a
penguin
cry
immediately
outside
the
tent
we
were
out
in
a
moment
there
a
few
yards
from
the
door
sat
a
big
emperor
penguin
making
bow
after
bow
it
gave
exactly
the
impression
of
having
come
up
simply
to
pay
us
its
respects
we
were
sorry
to
repay
its
attention
so
poorly
but
such
is
the
way
of
the
world
with
a
final
bow
it
ended
its
days
in
the
on
january
we
began
bringing
up
the
materials
for
the
hut
and
as
soon
as
they
arrived
the
builders
began
to
put
them
up
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
everything
went
like
a
machine
one
sledge
after
another
drove
up
to
the
site
and
discharged
its
load
the
dogs
worked
splendidly
and
their
drivers
no
less
and
as
fast
as
the
materials
arrived
our
future
home
rose
into
the
air
all
the
parts
had
been
marked
before
leaving
norway
and
were
now
discharged
from
the
ship
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
wanted
besides
which
stubberud
himself
had
built
the
house
so
that
he
knew
every
peg
of
it
it
is
with
gladness
and
pride
that
i
look
back
upon
those
days
with
gladness
because
no
discord
was
ever
heard
in
the
course
of
this
fairly
severe
labour
with
pride
because
i
was
at
the
head
of
such
a
body
of
men
for
men
they
were
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
everyone
knew
his
duty
and
did
it
during
the
night
the
wind
dropped
and
the
morning
brought
the
finest
weather
calm
and
clear
it
was
a
pleasure
to
work
on
days
like
this
both
men
and
dogs
were
in
the
best
of
spirits
on
these
journeys
between
the
ship
and
the
station
we
were
constantly
hunting
seals
but
we
only
took
those
that
came
in
our
way
we
never
had
to
go
far
to
find
fresh
meat
we
used
to
come
suddenly
upon
a
herd
of
them
they
were
then
shot
flayed
and
loaded
on
the
sledges
with
the
provisions
and
building
materials
the
dogs
feasted
in
those
days
they
had
as
much
warm
flesh
as
they
wanted
on
january
we
had
taken
up
all
the
building
materials
and
could
then
turn
our
attention
to
provisions
and
stores
the
work
went
merrily
backwards
and
forwards
and
the
journey
to
the
fram
in
the
morning
with
empty
sledges
was
specially
enjoyable
the
track
was
now
well
worn
and
hard
and
resembled
a
good
norwegian
country
road
more
than
anything
else
the
going
was
splendid
on
coming
out
of
the
tent
at
six
in
the
morning
one
was
instantly
greeted
with
joy
by
one
own
twelve
dogs
they
barked
and
howled
in
emulation
tugged
and
jerked
at
their
chains
to
get
to
their
master
and
jumped
and
danced
about
with
joy
then
one
would
first
go
down
the
line
and
say
to
each
of
them
in
turn
patting
them
and
saying
a
few
words
splendid
beasts
they
were
the
one
who
was
taken
notice
of
showed
every
sign
of
happiness
the
most
petted
of
our
domestic
dogs
could
not
have
shown
greater
devotion
than
these
tamed
wolves
all
the
time
the
others
were
yelling
and
pulling
at
their
chains
to
get
at
the
one
who
was
being
petted
for
they
are
jealous
in
the
extreme
when
they
had
all
received
their
share
of
attention
the
harness
was
brought
out
and
then
the
jubilation
broke
out
afresh
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
can
assert
that
these
animals
love
their
harness
although
they
must
know
that
it
means
hard
work
they
all
show
signs
of
the
greatest
rapture
at
the
sight
of
it
i
must
hasten
to
add
however
that
this
only
happens
at
home
long
and
fatiguing
sledge
journeys
show
a
very
different
state
of
things
when
it
came
to
harnessing
the
first
trouble
of
the
day
began
it
was
impossible
to
get
them
to
stand
still
the
full
meal
of
the
previous
evening
followed
by
the
night
rest
had
given
them
such
a
superabundance
of
energy
and
joy
of
life
that
nothing
could
make
them
stand
still
they
had
to
have
a
taste
of
the
whip
and
yet
it
was
a
pity
to
start
that
after
having
securely
anchored
the
sledge
one
was
ready
at
last
with
one
team
of
six
dogs
harnessed
now
it
might
be
thought
that
all
was
plain
sailing
and
that
one
had
only
to
cast
off
one
moorings
and
be
taken
straight
down
to
the
ship
but
that
was
far
from
being
the
case
round
about
the
camp
a
number
of
objects
had
collected
in
a
short
time
such
as
building
materials
empty
sledges
and
to
steer
clear
of
these
was
the
great
problem
of
the
morning
the
greatest
interest
was
of
course
concentrated
upon
these
objects
and
one
had
to
be
extremely
lucky
to
avoid
a
spill
let
us
follow
one
of
these
morning
drives
the
men
are
all
ready
and
have
their
dogs
well
harnessed
one
two
three
and
we
let
them
all
go
at
once
we
are
off
like
the
wind
and
before
one
has
time
to
swing
the
whip
one
finds
oneself
in
the
middle
of
a
heap
of
building
materials
the
dogs
have
achieved
the
desire
of
their
lives
to
be
able
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
these
materials
in
the
way
that
is
so
characteristic
of
the
dog
and
so
incomprehensible
to
us
while
this
process
is
going
on
with
the
greatest
enjoyment
the
driver
has
got
clear
of
the
sledge
and
begins
to
distentangle
the
traces
which
have
wound
themselves
round
planks
and
posts
and
whatever
else
maybe
lying
handy
he
is
far
from
having
achieved
the
desire
of
his
life
to
judge
from
the
expressions
he
uses
at
last
he
is
clear
again
he
looks
round
first
and
finds
he
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
met
with
difficulties
in
the
way
over
there
among
the
cases
he
sees
a
performance
going
on
which
makes
his
heart
leap
with
joy
one
of
the
old
hands
has
come
to
grief
and
in
so
decisive
a
fashion
that
it
will
take
him
a
long
time
to
get
clear
again
with
a
triumphant
smile
he
throws
himself
on
the
sledge
and
drives
off
so
long
as
he
is
on
the
barrier
as
a
rule
everything
goes
well
there
is
nothing
here
to
distract
the
dogs
it
is
otherwise
when
he
comes
down
to
the
here
seals
lie
scattered
about
in
groups
basking
in
the
sunshine
and
it
may
easily
happen
that
his
course
will
be
rather
crooked
if
a
team
of
fresh
dogs
have
made
up
their
minds
to
turn
aside
in
the
direction
of
a
herd
of
seals
it
takes
a
very
experienced
driver
to
get
them
in
the
right
way
again
personally
on
such
occasions
i
used
the
only
remedy
i
could
see
namely
capsizing
the
sledge
in
loose
snow
with
the
sledge
upset
they
soon
pulled
up
then
if
one
was
wise
one
put
them
on
the
right
course
again
quietly
and
calmly
hoisted
the
sledge
on
to
an
even
keel
and
went
on
but
one
is
not
always
wise
unfortunately
the
desire
to
be
revenged
on
the
disobedient
rascals
gets
the
upper
hand
and
one
begins
to
deal
out
punishment
but
this
is
not
so
easy
as
it
seems
so
long
as
you
are
sitting
on
the
capsized
sledge
it
makes
a
good
anchor
but
now
without
a
load
it
is
no
use
and
the
dogs
know
that
so
while
you
are
thrashing
one
the
others
start
off
and
the
result
is
not
always
flattering
to
the
driver
if
he
is
lucky
he
gets
on
to
the
capsized
sledge
again
but
we
have
seen
dogs
and
sledges
arrive
without
drivers
all
this
trouble
in
the
early
morning
sets
the
blood
in
active
circulation
and
one
arrives
at
the
ship
drenched
with
perspiration
in
spite
of
a
temperature
of
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
there
is
no
interruption
and
then
the
drive
is
soon
over
the
dogs
want
no
encouragement
they
are
willing
enough
the
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
lower
camp
to
the
fram
is
then
covered
in
a
few
minutes
when
we
came
out
of
the
tent
on
the
morning
of
january
we
were
greatly
surprised
we
thought
we
must
be
mistaken
rubbed
our
eyes
opened
them
wider
but
no
it
was
no
good
the
fram
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
it
had
been
blowing
pretty
strongly
during
the
night
with
presumably
the
weather
had
forced
them
to
put
out
we
could
also
hear
the
roar
of
the
sea
dashing
against
the
barrier
meanwhile
we
lost
no
time
the
day
before
captain
nilsen
and
kristensen
had
shot
forty
seals
and
of
these
we
had
brought
in
half
the
same
day
we
now
began
to
fetch
in
the
rest
during
the
forenoon
while
we
were
flaying
and
shooting
seals
we
heard
the
old
sound
put
put
put
of
the
fram
motor
and
presently
the
appeared
above
the
barrier
but
she
did
not
get
into
her
old
berth
before
evening
a
heavy
swell
had
forced
her
to
go
outside
meanwhile
the
carpenters
were
busily
constructing
the
hut
by
january
the
roof
was
on
and
the
rest
of
the
work
could
thus
be
done
under
cover
this
was
a
great
comfort
to
the
men
at
that
time
their
job
was
undoubtedly
the
worst
of
any
bitterly
cold
it
was
for
them
but
i
never
heard
them
talk
about
it
when
i
came
up
to
the
tent
after
the
day
work
one
of
them
was
busy
cooking
the
meal
always
consisted
of
pancakes
and
strong
coffee
how
good
it
tasted
a
rivalry
soon
arose
between
the
two
as
to
which
of
them
could
make
the
best
pancakes
i
think
they
were
both
clever
at
it
in
the
morning
we
had
pancakes
again
crisp
hot
delicate
pancakes
with
the
most
glorious
coffee
before
i
was
even
out
of
my
that
is
what
the
carpenters
had
to
offer
me
at
five
in
the
morning
no
wonder
i
enjoyed
their
society
nor
did
the
men
in
the
lower
camp
suffer
any
privation
wisting
showed
himself
to
be
possessed
of
eminent
talents
as
cook
for
the
day
his
special
dish
was
penguins
and
skua
gulls
in
cream
sauce
it
was
served
under
the
name
of
ptarmigan
of
which
it
really
reminded
one
that
sunday
we
all
went
on
board
with
the
exception
of
the
necessary
tent
guards
for
both
camps
and
enjoyed
life
we
had
worked
hard
enough
that
week
on
monday
january
we
began
to
carry
up
the
provisions
in
order
to
save
time
we
had
decided
not
to
bring
the
provisions
right
up
to
the
hut
but
to
store
them
for
the
time
being
on
an
elevation
that
lay
on
the
other
side
to
the
south
of
mount
nelson
this
spot
was
not
more
than
yards
from
the
hut
but
as
the
surface
was
rather
rough
here
we
should
save
a
good
deal
in
the
afterwards
when
the
fram
had
sailed
we
could
take
them
the
rest
of
the
way
as
it
turned
out
we
never
had
time
for
this
so
that
our
main
store
remained
here
sledging
up
to
this
point
offered
some
difficulties
at
first
the
dogs
who
were
accustomed
to
take
the
road
to
the
lower
camp
between
nelson
and
ronniken
could
not
understand
why
they
might
not
do
the
same
now
the
journey
with
empty
sledges
down
to
the
ship
was
often
particularly
troublesome
from
this
point
the
dogs
could
hear
their
companions
on
the
other
side
of
nelson
in
the
lower
camp
and
then
it
happened
more
than
once
that
the
dogs
took
command
if
they
once
got
in
the
humour
for
playing
tricks
of
that
sort
it
was
by
no
means
easy
to
get
them
under
control
we
all
of
us
had
this
experience
without
exception
not
one
of
us
escaped
this
little
extra
turn
as
the
provisions
came
up
each
driver
took
them
off
his
sledge
and
laid
the
cases
in
the
order
in
which
they
should
lie
we
began
by
placing
each
sort
by
itself
in
small
groups
over
the
slope
this
plan
had
the
advantage
that
everything
would
be
easy
to
find
the
load
was
usually
pounds
or
cases
to
each
sledge
we
had
about
cases
to
bring
up
and
reckoned
that
we
should
have
them
all
in
place
in
the
course
of
a
week
everything
went
remarkably
well
according
to
our
reckoning
by
noon
on
saturday
january
the
hut
was
ready
and
all
the
cases
were
in
place
the
depot
of
provisions
had
quite
an
imposing
appearance
great
rows
of
cases
stood
in
the
snow
all
with
their
numbers
outward
so
that
we
could
find
what
we
wanted
at
once
and
there
was
the
house
all
finished
exactly
as
it
had
stood
in
its
native
place
on
bundefjord
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
more
different
surroundings
there
green
pinewoods
and
splashing
water
here
ice
nothing
but
ice
but
both
scenes
were
beautiful
i
stood
thinking
which
i
preferred
my
thoughts
travelled
far
thousands
of
miles
in
a
second
it
was
the
forest
that
gained
the
day
as
i
have
already
mentioned
we
had
everything
with
us
for
fastening
the
but
down
to
the
barrier
but
the
calm
weather
we
had
had
all
the
time
led
us
to
suppose
that
the
conditions
would
not
be
so
bad
as
we
had
expected
we
were
therefore
satisfied
with
the
foundation
dug
in
the
barrier
the
outside
of
the
but
was
tarred
and
the
roof
covered
with
tarred
paper
so
that
it
was
very
visible
against
the
white
surroundings
that
afternoon
we
broke
up
both
camps
and
moved
into
our
home
framheim
what
a
snug
cosy
and
cleanly
impression
it
gave
us
when
we
entered
the
door
bright
new
linoleum
everywhere
in
the
kitchen
as
well
as
in
our
we
had
good
reason
to
be
happy
another
important
point
had
been
got
over
and
in
much
shorter
time
than
i
had
ever
hoped
our
path
to
the
goal
was
opening
up
we
began
to
have
a
glimpse
of
the
castle
in
the
distance
the
beauty
is
still
sleeping
but
the
kiss
is
coming
the
kiss
that
shall
wake
her
it
was
a
happy
party
that
assembled
in
the
hut
the
first
evening
and
drank
to
the
future
to
the
music
of
the
gramophone
all
the
dogs
were
now
brought
up
here
and
were
fastened
to
wire
ropes
stretched
in
a
square
yards
on
each
side
it
may
be
believed
that
they
gave
us
some
music
collected
as
they
were
they
performed
under
the
leadership
of
some
great
singer
or
other
daily
and
what
was
worse
nightly
concerts
strange
beasts
what
can
they
have
meant
by
this
howling
one
began
then
two
then
a
few
more
and
finally
the
whole
hundred
as
a
rule
during
a
concert
like
this
they
sit
well
down
stretch
their
heads
as
high
in
the
air
as
they
can
and
howl
to
their
hearts
content
during
this
act
they
seem
very
preoccupied
and
are
not
easily
disturbed
but
the
strangest
thing
is
the
way
the
concert
comes
to
an
end
it
stops
suddenly
along
the
whole
line
no
stragglers
no
one
cheer
more
what
is
it
that
imposes
this
simultaneous
stop
i
have
observed
and
studied
it
time
after
time
without
result
one
would
think
it
was
a
song
that
had
been
learnt
do
these
animals
possess
a
power
of
communicating
with
each
other
the
question
is
extraordinarily
interesting
no
one
among
us
who
has
had
long
acquaintance
with
eskimo
dogs
doubts
that
they
have
this
power
i
learned
at
last
to
understand
their
different
sounds
so
well
that
i
could
tell
by
their
voices
what
was
going
on
without
seeing
them
fighting
play
each
had
its
special
sound
if
they
wanted
to
express
their
devotion
and
affection
for
their
master
they
would
do
it
in
a
quite
different
way
if
one
of
them
was
doing
something
wrong
something
they
knew
they
were
not
allowed
to
do
such
as
breaking
into
a
for
example
the
others
who
could
not
get
in
ran
out
and
gave
vent
to
a
sound
quite
different
from
those
i
have
mentioned
i
believe
most
of
us
learned
to
distinguish
these
different
sounds
there
can
hardly
be
a
more
interesting
animal
to
observe
or
one
that
offers
greater
variety
of
study
than
the
eskimo
dog
from
his
ancestor
the
wolf
he
has
inherited
the
instinct
of
the
right
of
the
stronger
in
a
far
higher
degree
than
our
domestic
dog
the
struggle
for
life
has
brought
him
to
early
maturity
and
given
him
such
qualities
as
frugality
and
endurance
in
an
altogether
surprising
degree
his
intelligence
is
sharp
clear
and
well
developed
for
the
work
he
is
born
to
and
the
conditions
in
which
he
is
brought
up
we
must
not
call
the
eskimo
dog
slow
to
learn
because
he
can
not
sit
up
and
take
sugar
when
he
is
told
these
are
things
so
widely
separated
from
the
serious
business
of
his
life
that
he
will
never
be
able
to
understand
them
or
only
with
great
difficulty
among
themselves
the
right
of
the
stronger
is
the
only
law
the
strongest
rules
and
does
as
he
pleases
undisputedly
everything
belongs
to
him
the
weaker
ones
get
the
crumbs
friendship
easily
springs
up
between
these
animals
always
combined
with
respect
and
fear
of
the
stronger
the
weaker
with
his
instinct
of
seeks
the
protection
of
the
stronger
the
stronger
accepts
the
position
of
protector
and
thereby
secures
a
trusty
helper
always
with
the
thought
of
one
stronger
than
himself
the
instinct
of
is
to
be
found
everywhere
and
it
is
so
too
with
their
relations
with
man
the
dog
has
learnt
to
value
man
as
his
benefactor
from
whom
he
receives
everything
necessary
for
his
support
affection
and
devotion
seem
also
to
have
their
part
in
these
relations
but
no
doubt
on
a
closer
examination
the
instinct
of
is
at
the
root
of
all
as
a
consequence
of
this
his
respect
for
his
master
is
far
greater
than
in
our
domestic
dog
with
whom
respect
only
exists
as
a
consequence
of
the
fear
of
a
beating
i
could
without
hesitation
take
the
food
out
of
the
mouth
of
any
one
of
my
twelve
dogs
not
one
of
them
would
attempt
to
bite
me
and
why
because
their
respect
as
a
consequence
of
the
fear
of
getting
nothing
next
time
was
predominant
with
my
dogs
at
home
i
certainly
should
not
try
the
same
thing
they
would
at
once
defend
their
food
and
if
necessary
they
would
not
shrink
from
using
their
teeth
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
these
dogs
have
to
all
appearance
the
same
respect
as
the
others
what
then
is
the
reason
it
is
that
this
respect
is
not
based
on
a
serious
foundation
the
instinct
of
but
simply
on
the
fear
of
a
hiding
a
case
like
this
proves
that
the
foundation
is
too
weak
the
desire
of
food
overcomes
the
fear
of
the
stick
and
the
result
is
a
snap
a
few
days
later
the
last
member
of
the
wintering
party
adolf
henrik
lindstrom
joined
us
and
with
his
arrival
our
arrangements
might
be
regarded
as
complete
he
had
stayed
on
board
hitherto
attending
to
the
cooking
there
but
now
he
was
no
longer
necessary
his
art
would
be
more
appreciated
among
the
chatterers
the
youngest
member
of
the
expedition
the
cook
karinius
olsen
took
over
from
that
day
the
whole
of
the
cooking
on
the
fram
and
performed
this
work
in
an
extremely
conscientious
and
capable
way
until
the
ship
reached
hobart
in
march
when
he
again
had
assistance
this
was
well
done
for
a
lad
of
twenty
i
wish
we
had
many
like
him
with
lindstrom
then
the
kitchen
and
the
daily
bread
were
in
order
the
smoke
rose
gaily
from
the
shining
black
chimney
and
proclaimed
that
now
the
barrier
was
really
inhabited
how
cosy
it
was
when
we
came
sledging
up
after
the
day
work
to
see
that
smoke
rising
into
the
air
it
is
a
little
thing
really
but
nevertheless
it
means
so
much
with
lindstrom
came
not
only
food
but
light
and
air
both
of
them
his
specialities
the
lux
lamp
was
the
first
thing
he
rigged
up
giving
us
a
light
that
contributed
much
to
the
feeling
of
comfort
and
through
the
long
winter
he
also
provided
us
with
air
but
in
this
he
had
stubberud
as
a
partner
these
two
together
managed
to
give
us
the
finest
purest
barrier
air
in
our
room
during
the
whole
stay
it
is
true
that
this
was
not
done
without
hard
work
but
they
did
not
mind
that
the
ventilation
was
capricious
and
liable
to
fail
now
and
then
this
usually
happened
when
there
was
a
dead
calm
many
were
the
ingenious
devices
employed
by
the
firm
to
set
the
business
going
again
generally
a
primus
stove
was
used
under
the
exhaust
pipe
and
ice
applied
to
the
supply
pipe
while
one
of
them
lay
on
his
stomach
with
the
primus
under
the
exhaust
drawing
the
air
up
that
way
the
other
ran
up
to
the
roof
and
dropped
big
lumps
of
snow
down
the
supply
to
get
the
air
in
that
way
in
this
fashion
they
could
keep
it
going
by
the
hour
together
without
giving
up
it
finally
ended
in
the
ventilation
becoming
active
again
without
visible
cause
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
system
of
ventilation
in
a
like
ours
is
of
great
importance
both
to
health
and
comfort
i
have
read
of
expeditions
the
members
of
which
were
constantly
suffering
from
cold
and
damp
and
resulting
sickness
this
is
nothing
but
a
consequence
of
bad
ventilation
if
the
supply
of
fresh
air
is
sufficient
the
fuel
will
be
turned
to
better
account
and
the
production
of
warmth
will
of
course
be
greater
if
the
supply
of
air
is
insufficient
a
great
part
of
the
fuel
will
be
lost
in
an
unconsumed
state
and
cold
and
damp
will
be
the
result
there
must
of
course
be
a
means
of
regulating
the
ventilation
in
accordance
with
requirements
we
used
only
the
lux
lamp
in
our
hut
besides
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
and
with
this
we
kept
our
room
so
warm
that
those
of
us
in
the
upper
berths
were
constantly
complaining
of
the
warmth
originally
there
were
places
for
ten
bunks
in
the
room
but
as
there
were
only
nine
of
us
one
of
the
bunks
was
removed
and
the
space
used
for
our
chronometer
locker
this
contained
three
ordinary
ship
chronometers
we
had
in
addition
six
chronometer
watches
which
we
wore
continually
and
which
were
compared
throughout
the
whole
winter
the
meteorological
instruments
found
a
place
in
the
kitchen
the
only
place
we
had
for
them
lindstrom
undertook
the
position
of
of
the
framheim
meteorological
station
and
to
the
expedition
under
the
roof
were
stowed
all
the
things
that
would
not
stand
severe
frost
such
as
medicines
syrup
jam
cream
pickles
and
sauces
besides
all
our
a
place
was
also
made
for
the
library
under
the
roof
the
week
beginning
on
monday
january
was
spent
in
bringing
up
coal
wood
oil
and
our
whole
supply
of
dried
fish
the
temperature
this
summer
varied
between
and
a
grand
summer
temperature
we
also
shot
many
seals
daily
and
we
already
had
a
great
pile
of
about
a
hundred
of
them
lying
just
outside
the
door
of
the
hut
one
evening
as
we
were
sitting
at
supper
lindstrom
came
in
to
tell
us
that
we
need
not
go
down
any
more
to
the
to
shoot
them
as
they
were
coming
up
to
us
we
went
out
and
found
he
was
right
not
far
away
and
making
straight
for
the
hut
came
a
shining
like
silver
in
the
sun
he
came
right
up
was
photographed
and
shot
one
day
i
had
a
rather
curious
experience
my
best
dog
lassesen
had
his
left
frozen
quite
white
it
happened
while
we
were
all
out
sledging
lassesen
was
a
lover
of
freedom
and
had
seen
his
chance
of
getting
loose
when
unobserved
he
used
his
freedom
like
most
of
these
dogs
for
fighting
they
love
fighting
and
can
not
resist
it
he
had
picked
a
quarrel
with
odin
and
thor
and
started
a
battle
with
them
in
the
course
of
the
fight
the
chains
that
fastened
these
two
had
got
wound
round
lassesen
leg
and
twisted
so
that
the
circulation
was
stopped
how
long
he
had
been
standing
so
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
came
i
saw
at
once
that
the
dog
was
in
the
wrong
place
on
a
closer
examination
i
discovered
the
i
then
spent
half
an
hour
in
restoring
the
circulation
i
succeeded
in
doing
this
by
holding
the
paw
continuously
in
my
warm
hand
at
first
while
there
was
no
feeling
in
the
limb
it
went
well
but
when
the
blood
began
to
flow
back
of
course
it
was
painful
and
lassesen
became
impatient
he
whined
and
motioned
with
his
head
towards
the
affected
place
as
though
he
wanted
to
tell
me
that
he
found
the
operation
unpleasant
he
made
no
attempt
to
snap
the
paw
swelled
a
good
deal
after
this
treatment
but
next
day
lassesen
was
as
well
as
ever
though
a
little
lame
in
that
leg
the
entries
in
my
diary
at
this
time
are
all
in
telegraphic
style
no
doubt
owing
to
the
amount
of
work
thus
an
entry
in
february
ends
with
the
following
words
an
emperor
penguin
just
come
on
a
visit
he
did
not
get
a
very
long
epitaph
during
this
week
we
relieved
the
sea
party
of
the
last
of
the
dogs
about
twenty
puppies
there
was
rejoicing
on
board
when
the
last
of
them
left
the
deck
and
indeed
one
could
not
be
surprised
with
the
thermometer
about
as
it
had
been
lately
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
deck
clean
as
everything
froze
at
once
after
they
had
all
been
brought
on
to
the
ice
the
crew
went
to
work
with
salt
and
water
and
in
a
short
time
we
recognized
the
fram
again
the
puppies
were
put
into
boxes
and
driven
up
we
had
put
up
a
tent
to
receive
them
from
the
very
first
moment
they
declined
to
stay
in
it
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
let
them
out
all
these
puppies
passed
a
great
part
of
the
winter
in
the
open
air
so
long
as
the
seals
carcasses
were
lying
on
the
slope
they
stayed
there
afterwards
they
found
another
place
but
the
tent
despised
by
the
youngsters
came
in
useful
after
all
any
bitch
that
was
going
to
have
a
litter
was
put
in
there
and
the
tent
went
by
the
name
of
the
maternity
hospital
then
one
tent
after
another
was
put
up
and
framheim
looked
quite
an
important
place
eight
of
the
tents
were
set
up
for
our
eight
teams
two
for
dried
fish
one
for
fresh
meat
one
for
cases
of
provisions
and
one
for
coal
and
wood
fourteen
altogether
they
were
arranged
according
to
a
plan
drawn
up
beforehand
and
when
they
were
all
up
they
had
quite
the
appearance
of
a
camp
at
this
time
our
underwent
important
alterations
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
expedition
had
the
happy
idea
of
combining
the
alaska
and
the
greenland
harness
the
result
satisfied
all
requirements
in
future
we
always
used
this
construction
and
we
all
agreed
that
it
was
much
superior
to
any
other
harness
the
dogs
also
seemed
to
be
more
comfortable
in
it
that
they
worked
better
and
more
easily
is
certain
and
raw
places
so
common
with
greenland
harness
were
absolutely
unknown
february
was
an
eventful
day
as
usual
we
all
came
down
to
the
fram
driving
our
empty
sledges
at
six
in
the
morning
when
the
first
man
got
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
he
began
to
wave
his
arms
about
and
gesticulate
like
a
madman
i
understood
of
course
that
he
saw
something
but
what
the
next
man
gesticulated
even
worse
and
tried
to
shout
to
me
but
it
was
no
use
i
could
not
make
anything
of
it
then
it
was
my
turn
to
go
over
the
ridge
and
as
was
natural
i
began
to
feel
rather
curious
i
had
only
a
few
yards
more
to
go
and
then
it
was
explained
along
the
edge
of
the
ice
just
to
the
south
of
the
fram
a
large
barque
lay
moored
we
had
talked
of
the
possibility
of
meeting
the
terra
nova
captain
scott
vessel
when
she
was
on
her
way
to
king
edward
vii
land
but
it
was
a
great
surprise
all
the
same
now
it
was
my
turn
to
wave
my
arms
and
i
am
sure
i
did
it
no
worse
than
the
two
first
and
the
same
thing
was
repeated
with
all
of
us
as
soon
as
each
one
reached
the
top
of
the
ridge
what
the
last
man
did
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
for
certain
but
no
doubt
he
waved
his
arms
too
if
a
stranger
had
stood
and
watched
us
that
morning
on
the
ridge
he
would
surely
have
taken
us
for
a
lot
of
incurable
lunatics
the
way
seemed
long
that
day
but
at
last
we
got
there
and
heard
the
full
explanation
the
terra
nova
had
come
in
at
midnight
our
watchman
had
just
gone
below
for
a
cup
of
coffee
there
was
no
harm
in
that
and
when
he
came
up
again
there
was
another
ship
lying
off
the
foot
of
the
barrier
he
rubbed
his
eyes
pinched
his
leg
and
tried
other
means
of
convincing
himself
that
he
was
asleep
but
it
was
no
good
the
pinch
especially
he
told
us
afterwards
was
horribly
painful
and
all
this
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
there
really
was
a
second
vessel
there
lieutenant
campbell
the
leader
of
the
eastern
party
which
was
to
explore
king
edward
vii
land
came
on
board
first
and
paid
nilsen
a
visit
he
brought
the
news
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
reach
land
and
were
now
on
their
way
back
to
mcmurdo
sound
from
thence
it
was
their
intention
to
go
to
cape
north
and
explore
the
land
there
immediately
after
my
arrival
lieutenant
campbell
came
on
board
again
and
gave
me
the
news
himself
we
then
loaded
our
sledges
and
drove
home
at
nine
we
had
the
great
pleasure
of
receiving
lieutenant
pennell
the
commander
of
the
terra
nova
lieutenant
campbell
and
the
surgeon
of
the
expedition
as
the
first
guests
in
our
new
home
we
spent
a
couple
of
very
agreeable
hours
together
later
in
the
day
three
of
us
paid
a
visit
to
the
terra
nova
and
stayed
on
board
to
lunch
our
hosts
were
extremely
kind
and
offered
to
take
our
mail
to
new
zealand
if
i
had
had
time
i
should
have
been
glad
to
avail
myself
of
this
friendly
offer
but
every
hour
was
precious
it
was
no
use
to
think
of
writing
now
at
two
in
the
afternoon
the
terra
nova
cast
off
again
and
left
the
bay
of
whales
we
made
a
strange
discovery
after
this
visit
nearly
all
of
us
had
caught
cold
it
did
not
last
long
only
a
few
hours
and
then
it
was
over
the
form
it
took
was
sneezing
and
cold
in
the
head
the
next
day
sunday
february
the
sea
rovers
as
we
called
the
fram
party
were
our
guests
we
had
to
have
them
in
two
detachments
as
they
could
not
all
leave
the
ship
at
the
same
time
four
came
to
dinner
and
six
to
supper
we
had
not
much
to
offer
but
we
invited
them
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
entertainment
as
to
show
them
our
new
home
and
wish
them
a
successful
voyage
chapter
vi
depot
journeys
there
was
now
too
little
work
for
eight
of
us
in
bringing
up
stores
from
the
fram
and
it
became
evident
that
some
of
us
might
be
more
usefully
employed
elsewhere
it
was
therefore
decided
that
four
men
should
bring
ashore
the
little
that
remained
while
the
other
four
went
southward
to
lat
partly
to
explore
the
immediate
neighbourhood
and
partly
to
begin
the
transport
of
provisions
to
the
south
this
arrangement
gave
us
all
enough
to
do
the
four
who
were
to
continue
the
work
at
the
station
wisting
hassel
stubberud
and
bjaaland
now
had
as
much
as
their
sledges
could
carry
the
rest
of
us
were
busy
getting
ready
for
that
matter
everything
was
prepared
in
advance
but
as
yet
we
had
had
no
experience
of
a
long
journey
that
was
what
we
were
going
to
get
now
our
departure
was
fixed
for
friday
february
on
the
i
went
on
board
to
say
as
presumably
the
fram
would
have
sailed
when
we
came
back
i
had
so
much
to
thank
all
these
plucky
fellows
for
i
knew
it
was
hard
for
all
of
them
almost
without
exception
to
have
to
leave
us
now
at
the
most
interesting
time
and
go
out
to
sea
to
battle
for
months
with
cold
and
darkness
ice
and
storms
and
then
have
the
same
voyage
over
again
the
next
year
when
they
came
to
fetch
us
it
was
certainly
a
hard
task
but
none
of
them
complained
they
had
all
promised
to
do
their
best
to
promote
our
common
object
and
therefore
all
went
about
their
duty
without
grumbling
i
left
written
orders
with
the
commander
of
the
fram
captain
nilsen
the
substance
of
these
orders
may
be
given
in
a
few
words
carry
out
our
plan
in
the
way
you
may
think
best
i
knew
the
man
i
was
giving
orders
to
a
more
capable
and
honourable
second
in
command
i
could
never
have
had
i
knew
that
the
fram
was
safe
in
his
hands
lieutenant
prestrud
and
i
made
a
trip
to
the
south
to
find
a
suitable
place
for
ascending
the
barrier
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
the
was
fairly
even
for
this
distance
only
a
few
cracks
here
and
there
farther
up
the
bay
there
were
curiously
enough
long
rows
of
old
hummocks
what
could
this
mean
this
part
was
really
quite
protected
from
the
sea
so
that
these
formations
could
not
be
attributed
to
its
action
we
hoped
to
have
an
opportunity
of
investigating
the
conditions
more
closely
later
on
there
was
no
time
for
it
now
the
shortest
and
most
direct
way
to
the
south
was
the
one
we
were
on
now
the
bay
was
not
wide
here
the
distance
from
framheim
to
this
part
of
the
barrier
was
about
three
miles
the
ascent
of
the
barrier
was
not
difficult
with
the
exception
of
a
few
fissures
it
was
quite
easy
it
did
not
take
long
to
get
up
except
perhaps
in
the
steepest
part
the
height
was
feet
it
was
quite
exciting
to
go
up
what
should
we
see
at
the
top
we
had
never
yet
had
a
real
uninterrupted
view
over
the
barrier
to
the
south
this
was
the
first
time
as
it
happened
we
were
not
surprised
at
what
we
saw
when
we
got
up
an
endless
plain
that
was
lost
in
the
horizon
on
the
extreme
south
our
course
we
could
see
would
take
us
just
along
the
side
of
the
ridge
before
mentioned
a
capital
mark
for
later
journeys
the
going
was
excellent
a
thin
layer
of
conveniently
loose
snow
was
spread
over
a
hard
and
made
it
very
suitable
for
skiing
the
lie
of
the
ground
told
us
at
once
that
we
had
the
right
pattern
of
ski
the
kind
for
level
ground
long
and
narrow
we
had
found
what
we
wanted
an
ascent
for
our
southern
journeys
and
an
open
road
this
spot
was
afterwards
marked
with
a
flag
and
went
by
the
name
of
the
on
the
way
back
as
on
the
way
out
we
passed
large
herds
of
seals
lying
asleep
they
did
not
take
the
least
notice
of
us
if
we
went
up
and
woke
them
they
just
raised
their
heads
a
little
looked
at
us
for
a
moment
and
then
rolled
over
on
the
other
side
and
went
to
sleep
again
it
was
very
evident
that
these
animals
here
on
the
ice
have
no
enemies
they
would
certainly
have
set
a
watch
as
their
brothers
in
the
north
do
if
they
had
had
anything
to
fear
on
this
day
we
used
skin
clothing
for
the
first
time
clothes
of
eskimo
cut
but
they
proved
to
be
too
warm
we
had
the
same
experience
later
in
low
temperatures
these
reindeer
clothes
are
beyond
comparison
the
best
but
here
in
the
south
we
did
not
as
a
rule
have
low
temperatures
on
our
sledge
journeys
on
the
few
occasions
when
we
experienced
any
cold
worth
talking
about
we
were
always
in
skins
when
we
returned
in
the
evening
after
our
reconnoitring
we
had
no
need
of
a
turkish
bath
on
february
at
the
first
expedition
left
for
the
south
we
were
four
men
with
three
sledges
and
eighteen
dogs
six
for
each
sledge
the
load
amounted
to
about
pounds
of
provisions
per
sledge
besides
the
provisions
and
outfit
for
the
journey
we
could
not
tell
even
approximately
how
long
the
journey
would
take
as
everything
was
unknown
the
chief
thing
we
took
on
our
sledges
was
dogs
pemmican
for
the
depot
pounds
per
sledge
we
also
took
a
quantity
of
seal
meat
cut
into
steaks
blubber
dried
fish
chocolate
margarine
and
biscuits
we
had
ten
long
bamboo
poles
with
black
flags
to
mark
the
way
the
rest
of
our
outfit
consisted
of
two
tents
four
and
the
necessary
cooking
utensils
the
dogs
were
very
willing
and
we
left
framheim
at
full
gallop
along
the
barrier
we
went
well
going
down
to
the
we
had
to
pass
through
a
number
of
big
hummocks
a
fairly
rough
surface
nor
was
this
without
consequences
first
one
sledge
then
another
swung
round
but
no
harm
was
done
we
got
our
gear
tested
and
that
is
always
an
advantage
we
also
had
to
pass
rather
near
several
large
groups
of
seals
and
the
temptation
was
too
great
away
went
the
dogs
to
one
side
in
full
gallop
towards
the
seals
but
this
time
the
load
was
heavy
and
they
were
soon
tired
of
the
extra
work
in
the
bay
we
were
in
sight
of
the
fram
the
ice
had
now
given
way
entirely
so
that
she
lay
close
to
the
barrier
itself
our
four
comrades
who
were
to
stay
at
home
accompanied
us
in
the
first
place
they
wanted
to
see
us
on
our
way
and
in
the
second
they
would
be
able
to
lend
us
a
hand
in
getting
up
the
barrier
for
we
were
rather
apprehensive
that
it
would
cost
us
a
wet
shirt
finally
they
were
to
hunt
seals
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
here
one
looked
there
were
seals
fat
heavy
beasts
i
had
put
the
home
party
under
wisting
command
and
given
them
enough
work
to
do
they
were
to
bring
up
the
remainder
of
the
stores
from
the
ship
and
to
build
a
large
roomy
against
the
western
wall
of
the
hut
so
that
we
should
not
have
to
go
directly
on
to
the
ice
from
the
kitchen
we
also
intended
to
use
this
as
a
carpenter
workshop
but
they
were
not
to
forget
the
early
and
late
it
was
important
to
us
to
get
seals
enough
to
enable
us
all
men
and
dogs
to
live
in
plenty
and
there
were
enough
to
be
had
if
we
ran
short
of
fresh
meat
in
the
course
of
the
winter
it
would
be
entirely
our
own
fault
it
was
a
good
thing
we
had
help
for
the
climb
short
as
it
was
it
caused
us
a
good
deal
of
trouble
but
we
had
dogs
enough
and
by
harnessing
a
sufficient
number
we
got
the
sledges
up
i
should
like
to
know
what
they
thought
on
board
they
could
see
we
were
already
hard
put
to
it
to
get
up
here
what
would
it
be
like
when
we
had
to
get
on
to
the
plateau
i
do
not
know
whether
they
thought
of
the
old
saying
practice
makes
perfect
we
halted
at
the
where
we
were
to
separate
from
our
comrades
none
of
us
was
particularly
sentimental
an
honest
shake
of
the
hand
and
so
the
order
of
our
march
was
as
follows
prestrud
first
on
ski
to
show
the
direction
and
encourage
the
dogs
we
always
went
better
with
someone
going
in
front
next
came
helmer
hanssen
he
kept
this
place
on
all
our
journeys
the
leading
sledge
i
knew
him
well
from
our
previous
work
together
and
regarded
him
as
the
most
efficient
i
had
met
he
carried
the
standard
compass
on
his
sledge
and
checked
direction
after
him
came
johansen
also
with
a
compass
lastly
i
came
with
and
compass
i
preferred
to
take
the
last
sledge
because
it
enabled
me
to
see
what
was
happening
however
careful
one
may
be
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
dropping
things
from
sledges
in
making
a
journey
if
the
last
man
keeps
a
lookout
for
such
things
great
inconvenience
may
often
be
avoided
i
could
mention
many
rather
important
things
that
were
dropped
in
the
course
of
our
journeys
and
picked
up
again
by
the
last
man
the
hardest
work
of
course
falls
on
the
first
man
he
has
to
open
up
the
road
and
drive
his
dogs
forward
while
we
others
have
only
to
follow
all
honour
then
to
the
man
who
performed
this
task
from
the
first
day
to
the
last
helmer
hanssen
the
position
of
the
forerunner
is
not
a
very
enviable
one
either
of
course
he
escapes
all
bother
with
dogs
but
it
is
confoundedly
tedious
to
walk
there
alone
staring
at
nothing
his
only
diversion
is
a
shout
from
the
leading
sledge
a
little
to
the
right
a
little
to
the
left
it
is
not
so
much
these
simple
words
that
divert
him
as
the
tone
in
which
they
are
called
now
and
then
the
cry
comes
in
a
way
that
makes
him
feel
he
is
acquitting
himself
well
but
sometimes
it
sends
a
cold
shiver
down
his
back
the
speaker
might
just
as
well
have
added
the
word
duffer
there
is
no
mistaking
his
tone
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
go
straight
on
a
surface
without
landmarks
imagine
an
immense
plain
that
you
have
to
cross
in
thick
fog
it
is
dead
calm
and
the
snow
lies
evenly
without
drifts
what
would
you
do
an
eskimo
can
manage
it
but
none
of
us
we
should
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
and
give
the
leading
with
the
standard
compass
endless
trouble
it
is
strange
how
this
affects
the
mind
although
the
man
with
the
compass
knows
quite
well
that
the
man
in
front
can
not
do
any
better
and
although
he
knows
that
he
could
not
do
better
himself
he
nevertheless
gets
irritated
in
time
and
works
himself
into
the
belief
that
the
unsuspecting
perfectly
innocent
leader
only
takes
these
turns
to
annoy
him
and
so
as
i
have
said
the
words
a
little
to
the
left
imply
the
unspoken
addition
perfectly
understood
on
both
sides
duffer
i
have
personal
experience
of
both
duties
with
the
time
passes
far
more
quickly
he
has
his
dogs
to
look
after
and
has
to
see
that
all
are
working
and
none
shirking
many
other
points
about
a
team
claim
his
attention
and
he
must
always
keep
an
eye
on
the
sledge
itself
if
he
does
not
do
this
some
slight
unevenness
may
throw
the
runners
in
the
air
before
he
knows
where
he
is
and
to
right
a
capsized
sledge
weighing
about
eight
hundredweight
is
no
fun
so
instead
of
running
this
risk
he
gives
his
whole
attention
to
what
is
before
him
from
the
the
barrier
rises
very
slightly
until
at
a
it
passes
into
the
perfect
level
here
on
the
ridge
we
halt
once
more
our
comrades
have
disappeared
and
gone
to
their
work
but
in
the
distance
the
fram
lies
framed
in
shining
ice
we
are
but
human
uncertainty
always
limits
our
prospect
shall
we
meet
again
and
if
so
under
what
conditions
much
lay
between
that
moment
and
the
next
time
we
should
see
her
the
mighty
ocean
on
one
side
and
the
unknown
region
of
ice
on
the
other
so
many
things
might
happen
her
flag
floats
out
waves
us
a
last
adieu
and
disappears
we
are
on
our
way
to
the
south
this
first
inland
trip
on
the
barrier
was
undeniably
exciting
the
ground
was
absolutely
unknown
and
our
outfit
untried
what
kind
of
country
should
we
have
to
deal
with
would
it
continue
in
this
boundless
plain
without
hindrance
of
any
kind
or
would
nature
present
insurmountable
difficulties
were
we
right
in
supposing
that
dogs
were
the
best
means
of
transport
in
these
regions
or
should
we
have
done
better
to
take
reindeer
ponies
aeroplanes
or
anything
else
we
went
forward
at
a
rattling
pace
the
going
was
perfect
the
dogs
feet
trod
on
a
thin
layer
of
loose
snow
just
enough
to
give
them
a
secure
hold
the
weather
conditions
were
not
quite
what
we
should
have
wished
in
an
unknown
country
it
is
true
that
it
was
calm
and
mild
and
altogether
pleasant
for
travelling
but
the
light
was
not
good
a
grey
haze
the
most
unpleasant
kind
of
light
after
fog
lay
upon
the
landscape
making
the
barrier
and
the
sky
merge
into
one
there
was
no
horizon
to
be
seen
this
grey
haze
presumably
a
younger
sister
of
fog
is
extremely
disagreeable
one
can
never
be
certain
of
surroundings
there
are
no
shadows
everything
looks
the
same
in
a
light
like
this
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
be
the
forerunner
he
does
not
see
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
until
too
late
until
he
is
right
on
them
this
often
ends
in
a
fall
or
in
desperate
efforts
to
keep
on
his
feet
it
is
better
for
the
drivers
they
can
steady
themselves
with
a
hand
on
the
sledge
but
they
also
have
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
inequalities
and
see
that
the
sledges
do
not
capsize
this
light
is
also
very
trying
to
the
eyes
and
one
often
hears
of
after
such
a
day
the
cause
of
this
is
not
only
that
one
strains
eyes
continually
it
is
also
brought
about
by
carelessness
one
is
very
apt
to
push
one
up
on
to
one
forehead
especially
if
they
are
fitted
with
dark
glasses
however
we
always
came
through
it
very
well
only
a
few
of
us
had
a
little
touch
of
this
unpleasant
complaint
curiously
enough
has
something
in
common
with
seasickness
if
you
ask
a
man
whether
he
is
seasick
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
will
answer
no
not
at
all
only
a
little
queer
in
the
stomach
it
is
the
same
in
a
slightly
different
way
with
if
a
man
comes
into
the
tent
in
the
evening
with
an
inflamed
eye
and
you
ask
him
whether
he
is
you
may
be
sure
he
will
be
almost
offended
is
it
likely
no
not
at
all
only
a
little
queer
about
the
eye
we
did
seventeen
miles
that
day
without
exertion
we
had
two
tents
and
slept
two
in
a
tent
these
tents
were
made
for
three
men
but
were
too
small
for
four
cooking
was
only
done
in
one
both
for
the
sake
of
economy
so
that
we
might
leave
more
at
the
depot
and
because
it
was
unnecessary
as
the
weather
was
still
quite
mild
on
this
first
trip
as
on
all
the
depot
journeys
our
morning
arrangements
took
far
too
long
we
began
to
get
ready
at
four
but
were
not
on
the
road
till
nearly
eight
i
was
always
trying
some
means
of
remedying
this
but
without
success
it
will
naturally
be
asked
what
could
be
the
cause
of
this
and
i
will
answer
candidly
it
was
dawdling
and
nothing
else
on
these
depot
journeys
it
did
not
matter
so
much
but
on
the
main
journey
we
had
to
banish
dawdling
relentlessly
next
day
we
did
the
allotted
seventeen
miles
in
six
hours
and
pitched
our
camp
early
in
the
afternoon
the
dogs
were
rather
tired
as
it
had
been
uphill
work
all
day
from
a
distance
of
miles
we
could
look
down
into
the
bay
of
whales
this
shows
that
we
had
ascended
considerably
we
estimated
our
camp
that
evening
to
be
feet
above
the
sea
we
were
astonished
at
this
rise
but
ought
not
to
have
been
so
really
since
we
had
already
estimated
this
ridge
at
feet
when
we
first
saw
it
from
the
end
of
the
bay
but
however
it
may
be
most
of
us
have
a
strong
propensity
for
setting
up
theories
and
inventing
something
new
what
others
have
seen
does
not
interest
us
and
on
this
occasion
we
took
the
opportunity
i
say
we
because
i
was
one
of
them
of
propounding
a
new
theory
that
of
an
evenly
advancing
from
the
antarctic
plateau
we
saw
ourselves
in
our
mind
eye
ascending
gradually
to
the
top
and
thus
avoiding
a
steep
and
laborious
climb
among
the
mountains
the
day
had
been
very
warm
and
i
had
been
obliged
to
throw
off
everything
except
the
most
necessary
underclothes
my
costume
may
be
guessed
from
the
name
i
gave
to
the
ascent
singlet
hill
there
was
a
thick
fog
when
we
turned
out
next
morning
exceedingly
unpleasant
here
every
inch
was
over
virgin
ground
and
we
had
to
do
it
blindly
that
day
we
had
a
feeling
of
going
downhill
at
one
land
was
reported
right
ahead
from
the
gesticulations
of
those
in
front
i
made
out
that
it
must
be
uncommonly
big
i
saw
absolutely
nothing
but
that
was
not
very
surprising
my
sight
is
not
specially
good
and
the
land
did
not
exist
the
fog
lifted
and
the
surface
looked
a
little
broken
the
imaginary
land
lasted
till
the
next
day
when
we
found
out
that
it
had
only
been
a
descending
bank
of
fog
that
day
we
put
on
the
pace
and
did
miles
instead
of
our
usual
seventeen
we
were
very
lightly
clad
there
could
be
no
question
of
skins
they
were
laid
aside
at
once
very
light
was
all
we
wore
over
our
underclothes
on
this
journey
most
of
us
slept
barelegged
in
the
next
day
we
were
surprised
by
brilliantly
clear
weather
and
a
dead
calm
for
the
first
time
we
had
a
good
view
towards
the
south
the
barrier
seemed
to
continue
smooth
and
even
without
ascending
towards
the
east
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
marked
rise
presumably
towards
king
edward
vii
land
we
thought
then
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
passed
the
first
fissure
we
had
met
with
it
had
apparently
been
filled
up
long
ago
our
distance
that
day
was
miles
on
these
depot
journeys
we
were
always
very
glad
of
our
thermos
flasks
in
the
middle
of
the
day
we
made
a
halt
and
took
a
cup
of
scalding
hot
chocolate
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
able
to
get
one
without
any
trouble
in
the
middle
of
the
snow
plateau
on
the
final
southern
journey
we
did
not
take
thermos
flasks
we
had
no
lunch
then
on
february
after
a
march
of
eleven
and
a
half
miles
we
reached
unfortunately
we
did
not
succeed
in
getting
any
astronomical
observation
on
this
trip
as
the
theodolite
we
had
brought
with
us
went
wrong
but
later
observations
on
several
occasions
gave
not
so
bad
in
fog
we
had
marked
out
the
route
up
to
this
point
with
bamboo
poles
and
flags
at
every
kilometres
now
as
we
had
not
fixed
the
position
by
astronomical
observation
we
found
that
the
flags
would
not
be
sufficient
and
we
had
to
look
for
some
other
means
of
marking
the
spot
a
few
empty
cases
were
broken
up
and
gave
a
certain
number
of
marks
but
not
nearly
enough
then
our
eyes
fell
upon
a
bundle
of
dried
fish
lying
on
one
of
the
sledges
and
our
marking
pegs
were
found
i
should
like
to
know
whether
any
road
has
been
marked
out
with
dried
fish
before
i
doubt
it
immediately
on
our
arrival
in
lat
at
eleven
in
the
morning
we
began
to
erect
the
depot
it
was
made
quite
solid
and
was
feet
high
the
going
here
in
was
quite
different
from
what
we
had
had
all
the
rest
of
the
way
deep
loose
snow
gave
us
the
impression
that
it
must
have
fallen
in
perfectly
still
weather
generally
when
we
passed
by
here
but
not
always
we
found
this
loose
snow
when
the
depot
was
finished
and
had
been
photographed
we
threw
ourselves
on
the
sledges
and
began
the
homeward
journey
it
was
quite
a
treat
to
sit
and
be
drawn
along
a
thing
that
otherwise
never
happened
prestrud
sat
with
me
hanssen
drove
first
but
as
he
now
had
the
old
track
to
follow
he
wanted
no
one
in
front
on
the
last
sledge
we
had
the
marking
pegs
prestrud
kept
an
eye
on
the
and
sang
out
at
every
while
at
the
same
time
i
stuck
a
dried
fish
into
the
snow
this
method
of
marking
the
route
proved
a
brilliant
one
not
only
did
the
dried
fish
show
us
the
right
way
on
several
occasions
but
they
also
came
in
very
useful
on
the
next
journey
when
we
returned
with
starving
dogs
that
day
we
covered
miles
we
did
not
get
to
bed
till
one
at
night
but
this
did
not
prevent
our
being
up
again
at
four
and
off
at
seven
at
nine
in
the
evening
we
drove
into
framheim
after
covering
miles
that
day
our
reason
for
driving
that
distance
was
not
to
set
up
any
record
for
the
barrier
but
to
get
home
if
possible
before
the
fram
sailed
and
thus
have
an
opportunity
of
once
more
shaking
hands
with
our
comrades
and
wishing
them
a
good
voyage
but
as
we
came
over
the
edge
of
the
barrier
we
saw
that
in
spite
of
all
our
pains
we
had
come
too
late
the
fram
was
not
there
it
gave
us
a
strange
and
melancholy
feeling
not
easy
to
understand
but
the
next
moment
common
sense
returned
and
our
joy
at
her
having
got
away
from
the
barrier
undamaged
after
the
long
stay
was
soon
uppermost
we
heard
that
she
had
left
the
bay
at
noon
the
same
day
just
as
we
were
spurting
our
hardest
to
reach
her
this
depot
journey
was
quite
sufficient
to
tell
us
what
the
future
had
in
store
after
this
we
were
justified
in
seeing
it
in
a
rosy
light
we
now
had
experience
of
the
three
important
factors
the
lie
of
the
ground
the
going
and
the
means
of
traction
and
the
result
was
that
nothing
could
be
better
everything
was
in
the
most
perfect
order
i
had
always
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
dog
as
a
draught
animal
but
after
this
last
performance
my
admiration
for
these
splendid
animals
rose
to
the
pitch
of
enthusiasm
let
us
look
at
what
my
dogs
accomplished
on
this
occasion
on
february
they
went
eleven
miles
southward
with
a
load
of
pounds
and
on
the
same
day
miles
northward
only
four
of
them
the
three
musketeers
and
lassesen
as
fix
and
snuppesen
refused
to
do
any
work
the
weight
they
started
with
from
was
that
of
the
sledge
pounds
prestrud
pounds
and
myself
pounds
add
to
this
pounds
for
ski
and
dried
fish
and
we
have
a
total
weight
of
pounds
or
about
pounds
per
dog
the
last
day
they
did
miles
i
think
the
dogs
showed
on
this
occasion
that
they
were
well
suited
for
sledging
on
the
barrier
in
addition
to
this
brilliant
result
we
arrived
at
several
other
conclusions
in
the
first
place
the
question
of
the
long
time
spent
in
our
morning
preparations
thrust
itself
on
our
notice
this
could
not
be
allowed
to
occur
on
the
main
journey
at
least
two
hours
might
be
saved
i
had
no
doubt
of
that
but
how
i
should
have
to
take
time
to
think
it
over
what
required
most
alteration
was
our
heavy
outfit
the
sledges
were
constructed
with
a
view
to
the
most
difficult
conditions
of
ground
the
surface
here
was
of
the
easiest
kind
and
consequently
permitted
the
use
of
the
lightest
outfit
we
ought
to
be
able
to
reduce
the
weight
of
the
sledges
by
at
least
half
possibly
more
our
big
canvas
were
found
to
need
thorough
alteration
they
were
too
small
and
too
stiff
and
had
to
be
made
larger
and
softer
had
such
an
important
bearing
on
the
success
of
the
whole
expedition
that
we
had
to
do
all
that
could
be
done
to
get
it
right
the
four
who
had
stayed
at
home
had
accomplished
a
fine
piece
of
work
framheim
was
hardly
recognizable
with
the
big
new
addition
on
its
western
wall
this
was
of
the
same
width
as
the
hut
feet
and
measured
about
feet
the
other
way
windows
had
been
put
in
two
of
them
and
it
looked
quite
bright
and
pleasant
when
one
came
in
but
this
was
not
to
last
for
long
our
architects
had
also
dug
a
passage
feet
wide
round
the
whole
hut
and
this
was
now
covered
over
simply
by
prolonging
the
sloping
roof
down
to
the
snow
to
form
a
roof
over
this
passage
on
the
side
facing
east
a
plank
was
fixed
across
the
gable
at
the
required
height
and
from
this
boards
were
brought
down
to
the
snow
the
lower
part
of
this
new
extension
of
the
roof
was
well
strengthened
as
the
weight
of
snow
that
would
probably
accumulate
upon
it
in
the
course
of
the
winter
would
be
very
great
this
passage
was
connected
with
the
by
a
in
the
northern
wall
the
passage
was
constructed
to
serve
as
a
place
for
storing
tinned
foods
and
fresh
meat
besides
which
its
eastern
end
afforded
an
excellent
place
to
get
snow
for
melting
here
lindstrom
could
be
sure
of
getting
as
much
clean
snow
as
he
wanted
which
was
an
impossibility
outside
the
house
we
had
dogs
running
about
and
they
were
not
particular
as
to
the
purpose
for
which
we
might
want
the
snow
but
here
in
this
snow
wall
lindstrom
had
no
need
to
fear
the
dogs
another
great
advantage
was
that
he
would
not
have
to
go
out
in
bad
weather
darkness
and
cold
every
time
he
wanted
a
piece
of
ice
we
now
had
to
turn
our
attention
in
the
first
place
before
the
cold
weather
set
in
to
the
arrangement
of
our
dog
tents
we
could
not
leave
them
standing
as
they
were
on
the
snow
if
we
did
so
we
should
soon
find
that
dogs
teeth
are
just
as
sharp
as
knives
besides
which
they
would
be
draughty
and
cold
for
the
animals
to
counteract
this
the
floor
of
each
tent
was
sunk
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
barrier
a
great
part
of
this
excavation
had
to
be
done
with
axes
as
we
soon
came
to
the
bare
ice
one
of
these
dog
tents
when
finished
had
quite
an
important
appearance
when
one
stood
at
the
bottom
and
looked
up
it
measured
feet
from
the
floor
to
the
peak
of
the
tent
and
the
diameter
of
the
floor
was
feet
then
twelve
posts
were
driven
into
the
ice
of
the
floor
at
equal
intervals
round
the
wall
of
the
tent
and
the
dogs
were
tethered
to
them
from
the
very
first
day
the
dogs
took
a
liking
to
their
quarters
and
they
were
right
as
they
were
well
off
there
i
do
not
remember
once
seeing
on
the
coats
of
my
dogs
down
in
the
tent
they
enjoyed
every
advantage
there
air
without
draughts
light
and
sufficient
room
round
the
we
left
a
pillar
of
snow
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
to
the
height
of
a
man
it
took
us
two
days
to
put
our
eight
dog
tents
in
order
before
the
fram
sailed
one
of
the
had
been
put
ashore
on
the
barrier
one
never
knew
if
we
found
ourselves
in
want
of
a
boat
it
would
be
bad
to
have
none
and
if
we
did
not
have
to
use
it
there
was
no
great
harm
done
it
was
brought
up
on
two
sledges
drawn
by
twelve
dogs
and
was
taken
some
distance
into
the
barrier
the
mast
stood
high
in
the
air
and
showed
us
its
position
clearly
besides
all
their
other
work
the
four
men
had
found
time
for
shooting
seals
while
we
were
away
and
large
quantities
of
meat
were
now
stowed
everywhere
we
had
to
lose
no
time
in
getting
ready
the
tent
in
which
we
stored
our
chief
supply
of
seal
meat
it
would
not
have
lasted
long
if
we
had
left
it
unprotected
on
the
ground
to
keep
off
the
dogs
we
built
a
wall
feet
high
of
large
blocks
of
snow
the
dogs
themselves
saw
to
its
covering
with
ice
and
for
the
time
being
all
possibility
of
their
reaching
the
meat
was
removed
we
did
not
let
the
floor
grow
old
under
our
feet
it
was
time
to
be
off
again
to
the
south
with
more
food
our
departure
was
fixed
for
february
and
before
that
time
we
had
a
great
deal
to
do
all
the
provisions
had
first
to
be
brought
from
the
main
depot
and
prepared
for
the
journey
then
we
had
to
open
the
cases
of
pemmican
take
out
the
boxes
in
which
it
was
soldered
four
rations
in
each
cut
these
open
and
put
the
four
rations
back
in
the
case
without
the
tin
lining
by
doing
this
we
saved
so
much
weight
and
at
the
same
time
avoided
the
trouble
of
having
this
work
to
do
later
on
in
the
cold
the
tin
packing
was
used
for
the
passage
through
the
tropics
where
i
was
afraid
the
pemmican
might
possibly
melt
and
run
into
the
hold
of
the
ship
this
opening
and
repacking
took
a
long
time
but
we
got
through
it
we
used
the
as
a
another
thing
that
took
up
a
good
deal
of
our
time
was
our
personal
outfit
the
question
of
boots
was
gone
into
thoroughly
most
of
us
were
in
favour
of
the
big
outer
boots
but
in
a
revised
edition
there
were
a
few
but
extremely
few
who
declared
for
nothing
but
soft
in
this
case
it
did
not
make
so
much
difference
since
they
all
knew
that
the
big
boots
would
have
to
be
brought
on
the
final
journey
on
account
of
possible
work
on
glaciers
those
therefore
who
wanted
to
wear
soft
and
hang
their
boots
on
the
sledge
might
do
so
if
they
liked
i
did
not
want
to
force
anyone
to
wear
boots
he
did
not
care
for
it
might
lead
to
too
much
unpleasantness
and
responsibility
everyone
therefore
might
do
as
he
pleased
personally
i
was
in
favour
of
boots
with
stiff
soles
so
long
as
the
uppers
could
be
made
soft
and
sufficiently
large
to
give
room
for
as
many
stockings
as
one
wished
to
wear
it
was
a
good
thing
the
could
not
look
in
upon
us
at
framheim
just
then
and
many
times
afterwards
for
that
matter
the
knife
was
mercilessly
applied
to
all
his
beautiful
work
and
all
the
canvas
plus
a
quantity
of
the
superfluous
leather
was
cut
away
as
i
had
no
great
knowledge
of
the
shoemaker
craft
i
gladly
accepted
wisting
offer
to
operate
on
mine
the
boots
were
unrecognizable
when
i
got
them
back
from
him
as
regards
shape
they
were
perhaps
just
as
smart
before
the
alteration
but
as
that
is
a
very
unimportant
matter
in
comparison
with
ease
and
comfort
i
considered
them
improved
by
many
degrees
the
thick
canvas
was
torn
off
and
replaced
by
thin
fabric
big
wedges
were
inserted
in
the
toes
and
allowed
room
for
several
more
pairs
of
stockings
besides
this
one
of
the
many
soles
was
removed
thus
increasing
the
available
space
it
appeared
to
me
that
now
i
had
that
combined
all
the
qualities
i
demanded
stiff
soles
on
which
ellefsen
could
be
used
and
otherwise
soft
so
that
the
foot
was
not
pinched
anywhere
in
spite
of
all
these
alterations
my
boots
were
once
more
in
the
hands
of
the
operator
before
the
main
journey
but
then
they
were
made
perfect
the
boots
of
all
the
others
underwent
the
same
transformation
and
every
day
our
outfit
became
more
complete
a
number
of
minor
alterations
in
our
wardrobe
were
also
carried
out
one
man
was
an
enthusiast
for
blinkers
on
his
cap
another
did
not
care
for
them
one
put
on
a
another
took
his
off
and
if
there
was
a
question
of
which
was
right
each
was
prepared
to
defend
his
idea
to
the
last
these
were
all
alterations
of
minor
importance
but
being
due
to
individual
judgment
they
helped
to
raise
the
spirits
and
increase
patents
for
braces
also
became
the
fashion
i
invented
one
myself
and
was
very
proud
of
it
for
a
time
indeed
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
adopted
by
one
of
my
rivals
but
that
rarely
happened
each
of
us
wanted
to
make
his
own
inventions
and
to
be
as
original
as
possible
any
contrivance
that
resembled
something
already
in
use
was
no
good
but
we
found
like
the
farmer
that
the
old
way
often
turned
out
to
be
the
best
by
the
evening
of
february
we
were
again
ready
to
start
the
sledges
seven
in
number
stood
ready
packed
and
were
quite
imposing
in
appearance
tempted
by
the
favourable
outcome
of
our
former
trip
we
put
too
much
on
our
sledges
this
time
on
some
of
them
in
any
case
mine
was
overloaded
i
had
to
suffer
for
it
afterwards
or
rather
my
noble
animals
did
on
february
at
the
caravan
moved
off
eight
men
seven
sledges
and
dogs
and
the
most
toilsome
part
of
our
whole
expedition
began
as
usual
we
began
well
from
framheim
lindstrom
who
was
to
stay
at
home
alone
and
look
after
things
did
not
stand
and
wave
farewells
to
us
beaming
with
joy
he
made
for
the
hut
as
soon
as
the
last
sledge
was
in
motion
he
was
visibly
relieved
but
i
knew
very
well
that
before
long
he
would
begin
to
take
little
turns
outside
to
watch
the
ridge
would
they
soon
be
coming
there
was
a
light
breeze
from
the
south
dead
against
us
and
the
sky
was
overcast
newly
fallen
snow
made
the
going
heavy
and
the
dogs
had
hard
work
with
their
loads
our
former
tracks
were
no
longer
visible
but
we
were
lucky
enough
to
find
the
first
flag
which
stood
eleven
miles
inland
from
there
we
followed
the
dried
fish
which
stood
out
sharply
against
the
white
snow
and
were
very
easy
to
see
we
pitched
our
camp
at
six
in
the
evening
having
come
a
distance
of
seventeen
miles
our
camp
was
quite
imposing
four
tents
for
three
men
apiece
with
two
in
each
in
two
of
them
the
housekeeping
arrangements
were
carried
on
the
weather
had
improved
during
the
afternoon
and
by
evening
we
had
the
most
brilliantly
clear
sky
next
day
the
going
was
even
heavier
and
the
dogs
were
severely
tried
w
e
did
no
more
than
twelve
and
a
half
miles
after
eight
march
the
temperature
remained
reasonable
we
had
lost
our
dried
fish
and
for
the
last
few
hours
were
going
only
by
compass
february
began
badly
a
strong
wind
from
the
with
thick
driving
snow
we
could
see
nothing
and
had
to
steer
our
course
by
compass
it
was
bitter
going
against
the
wind
although
the
temperature
was
no
worse
than
we
went
all
day
without
seeing
any
mark
the
snow
stopped
falling
about
noon
and
at
three
it
cleared
as
we
were
looking
about
for
a
place
to
pitch
the
tents
we
caught
sight
of
one
of
our
flags
when
we
reached
it
we
found
it
was
flag
no
all
our
bamboos
were
numbered
so
we
knew
the
exact
position
of
the
flag
no
was
and
a
half
miles
from
framheim
this
agreed
well
with
the
distance
recorded
miles
the
next
day
was
calm
and
clear
and
the
temperature
began
to
descend
but
in
spite
of
this
lower
temperature
the
air
felt
considerably
milder
as
it
was
quite
still
we
followed
marks
and
fish
the
whole
way
and
at
the
end
of
our
day
journey
we
had
covered
eighteen
miles
a
good
distance
for
heavy
going
we
then
had
a
couple
of
days
of
bitter
cold
with
fog
so
that
we
did
not
see
much
of
our
surroundings
we
followed
the
fish
and
the
marks
most
of
the
way
we
had
already
begun
to
find
the
fish
useful
as
extra
food
the
dogs
took
it
greedily
the
forerunner
had
to
take
up
each
fish
and
throw
it
on
one
side
then
one
of
the
drivers
went
out
took
it
up
and
put
it
on
his
sledge
if
the
dogs
had
come
upon
the
fish
standing
in
the
snow
we
should
soon
have
had
fierce
fights
even
now
before
we
reached
the
depot
in
the
dogs
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
probably
as
a
result
of
the
cold
weather
and
the
hard
work
they
were
stiff
in
the
legs
in
the
morning
and
difficult
to
set
going
on
february
at
we
reached
the
depot
in
the
depot
was
standing
as
we
had
left
it
and
no
had
formed
about
it
from
which
we
concluded
that
the
weather
conditions
had
been
quiet
the
snow
which
we
had
found
very
loose
when
we
were
there
before
was
now
hardened
by
the
cold
we
were
lucky
with
the
sun
and
got
the
position
of
the
depot
accurately
determined
on
our
way
across
these
endless
plains
where
no
landmarks
of
any
kind
are
to
be
found
we
had
repeatedly
thought
of
a
means
of
marking
our
depots
so
that
we
might
be
perfectly
sure
of
finding
them
again
our
fight
for
the
pole
was
entirely
dependent
on
this
autumn
work
in
laying
down
large
supplies
of
provisions
as
far
to
the
south
as
possible
in
such
a
way
that
we
could
be
certain
of
finding
them
again
if
we
missed
them
the
battle
would
probably
be
lost
as
i
have
said
we
had
discussed
the
question
thoroughly
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
should
have
to
try
to
mark
our
depots
at
right
angles
to
the
route
in
an
east
and
west
direction
instead
of
in
a
line
with
the
route
north
and
south
these
marks
along
the
line
of
the
route
may
easily
be
missed
in
fog
if
they
are
not
close
enough
together
and
if
one
thus
gets
out
of
the
line
there
is
a
danger
of
not
picking
it
up
again
according
to
this
new
arrangement
we
therefore
marked
this
depot
in
with
high
bamboo
poles
carrying
black
flags
we
used
twenty
of
these
ten
on
each
side
of
the
depot
between
each
two
flags
there
was
a
distance
of
yards
metres
so
that
the
distance
marked
on
each
side
of
the
depot
was
five
and
a
half
miles
nine
kilometres
each
bamboo
was
marked
with
a
number
so
that
we
should
always
be
able
to
tell
from
this
number
on
which
side
the
depot
lay
and
how
far
off
this
method
was
entirely
new
and
untried
but
proved
afterwards
to
work
with
absolute
certainty
our
compasses
and
had
of
course
been
carefully
adjusted
at
the
station
and
we
knew
that
we
could
rely
on
them
having
put
this
in
order
we
continued
our
journey
on
the
following
day
the
temperature
fell
steadily
as
we
went
inland
if
it
continued
in
this
way
it
would
be
cold
before
one
got
to
the
pole
the
surface
remained
as
before
flat
and
even
we
ourselves
had
a
feeling
that
we
were
ascending
but
as
the
future
will
show
this
was
only
imagination
we
had
had
no
trouble
with
fissures
and
it
almost
looked
as
if
we
should
avoid
them
altogether
since
of
course
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
part
of
the
barrier
nearest
the
edge
would
be
the
most
fissured
and
we
had
already
left
that
behind
us
south
of
we
found
the
going
easier
but
the
dogs
were
now
beginning
to
be
stiff
and
and
it
was
hard
work
to
get
them
started
in
the
morning
the
sore
feet
i
am
speaking
of
here
are
not
nearly
so
bad
as
those
the
dogs
are
liable
to
on
the
of
the
arctic
regions
what
caused
sore
feet
on
this
journey
was
the
stretches
of
we
had
to
cross
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
dogs
and
they
broke
through
and
cut
their
paws
sore
feet
were
also
caused
by
the
snow
caking
and
sticking
between
the
toes
but
the
dog
that
has
to
travel
on
in
spring
and
summer
is
exposed
to
worse
things
the
sharp
ice
cuts
the
paws
and
the
salt
gets
in
to
prevent
this
kind
of
sore
feet
one
is
almost
obliged
to
put
socks
on
the
dogs
with
the
kind
of
our
dogs
experienced
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
any
such
precautions
as
a
result
of
the
long
sea
voyage
their
feet
had
become
unusually
tender
and
could
not
stand
much
on
our
spring
journey
we
noticed
no
in
spite
of
the
conditions
being
worse
rather
than
better
probably
their
feet
had
got
into
condition
in
the
course
of
the
winter
on
march
we
reached
the
temperature
was
then
and
it
did
not
feel
pleasant
the
change
had
come
too
rapidly
this
could
be
seen
both
in
men
and
in
dogs
we
pitched
our
camp
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
went
straight
into
the
tents
the
following
day
was
employed
in
building
and
marking
the
depot
that
night
was
the
coldest
we
observed
on
the
trip
as
the
temperature
was
when
we
turned
out
in
the
morning
if
one
compares
the
conditions
of
temperature
in
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
it
will
be
seen
that
this
temperature
is
an
exceptionally
low
one
the
beginning
of
march
corresponds
of
course
to
the
beginning
of
september
in
the
northern
hemisphere
a
time
of
year
when
summer
still
prevails
we
were
astonished
to
find
this
low
temperature
while
summer
ought
still
to
have
lasted
especially
when
i
remembered
the
moderate
temperatures
shackleton
had
observed
on
his
southern
sledge
journey
the
idea
at
once
occurred
to
me
of
the
existence
of
a
local
pole
of
maximum
cold
extending
over
the
central
portion
of
the
ross
barrier
a
comparison
with
the
observations
recorded
at
captain
scott
station
in
mcmurdo
sound
might
to
some
extent
explain
this
in
order
to
establish
it
completely
one
would
require
to
have
information
about
the
conditions
in
king
edward
land
as
well
the
observations
mawson
is
now
engaged
upon
in
adelie
land
and
on
the
barrier
farther
west
will
contribute
much
to
the
elucidation
of
this
question
in
we
laid
down
a
depot
consisting
of
fourteen
cases
of
pemmican
pounds
for
marking
this
depot
we
had
no
bamboo
poles
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
break
up
some
cases
and
use
the
pieces
as
marks
this
was
at
any
rate
better
than
nothing
personally
i
considered
these
pieces
of
wood
feet
high
good
enough
considering
the
amount
of
precipitation
i
had
remarked
since
our
arrival
in
these
regions
the
precipitation
we
had
observed
was
very
slight
considering
the
time
of
year
spring
and
summer
if
then
the
snowfall
was
so
inconsiderable
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
along
the
edge
of
the
barrier
what
might
it
not
be
in
autumn
and
winter
in
the
interior
as
i
have
said
something
was
better
than
nothing
and
bjaaland
hassel
and
stubberud
who
were
to
return
to
lindstrom
on
the
following
day
were
given
the
task
of
setting
up
these
marks
as
with
the
former
depot
this
one
was
marked
for
nine
kilometres
on
each
side
from
east
to
west
so
that
we
might
know
where
the
depot
was
in
case
we
should
come
upon
one
of
these
marks
in
a
fog
all
those
on
the
east
were
marked
with
a
little
cut
of
an
axe
i
must
confess
they
looked
insignificant
these
little
bits
of
wood
that
were
soon
lost
to
sight
on
the
boundless
plain
and
the
idea
that
they
held
the
key
of
the
castle
where
the
fair
one
slept
made
me
smile
they
looked
altogether
too
inconsiderable
for
such
an
honour
meanwhile
we
others
who
were
to
go
on
to
the
south
took
it
easy
the
rest
was
good
for
the
dogs
especially
though
the
cold
prevented
their
enjoying
it
as
they
should
have
done
at
eight
next
morning
we
parted
company
with
the
three
who
went
north
i
had
to
send
home
one
of
my
dogs
odin
who
had
got
an
ugly
raw
place
i
was
using
greenland
harness
on
him
and
i
went
on
with
five
dogs
these
were
very
thin
and
apparently
worn
out
but
in
any
case
we
had
to
reach
before
we
gave
up
i
had
had
some
hope
that
we
might
have
got
to
but
it
began
to
look
as
if
we
had
a
poor
chance
of
that
after
the
barrier
began
to
take
on
a
slightly
different
appearance
instead
of
the
absolutely
flat
surface
we
saw
on
the
first
day
a
good
many
small
formations
of
the
shape
of
haycocks
at
that
time
we
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
these
apparently
insignificant
irregularities
but
later
on
we
learned
to
keep
our
eyes
open
and
our
feet
active
when
passing
in
their
vicinity
on
this
first
day
southward
from
we
noticed
nothing
the
going
was
excellent
the
temperature
not
so
bad
as
it
had
been
and
the
distance
covered
very
creditable
the
next
day
we
got
our
first
idea
of
the
meaning
of
these
little
mounds
as
the
surface
was
cut
up
by
crevasse
after
crevasse
these
fissures
were
not
particularly
wide
but
were
bottomless
as
far
as
we
could
see
about
noon
hanssen
three
leading
dogs
helge
mylius
and
ring
fell
into
one
of
them
and
remained
hanging
by
their
harness
and
it
was
lucky
the
traces
held
as
the
loss
of
these
three
would
have
been
severely
felt
when
the
rest
of
the
team
saw
these
three
disappear
they
stopped
short
fortunately
they
had
a
pronounced
fear
of
these
fissures
and
always
stopped
when
anything
happened
we
understood
now
that
the
haycock
formations
were
the
result
of
pressure
and
that
crevasses
were
always
found
in
their
neighbourhood
that
day
was
for
the
most
part
thick
and
hazy
with
a
northerly
wind
and
from
time
to
time
between
the
showers
we
caught
sight
of
lofty
very
lofty
pressure
ridges
three
or
four
of
them
to
the
eastward
we
estimated
their
distance
at
about
six
miles
next
day
march
we
had
the
same
experience
that
shackleton
mentions
on
several
occasions
the
morning
began
clear
and
fine
with
a
temperature
of
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
a
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
and
increased
to
a
gale
during
the
afternoon
the
temperature
rose
rapidly
and
when
we
pitched
our
camp
at
three
in
the
afternoon
it
was
only
at
our
that
morning
we
left
a
case
of
dogs
pemmican
for
use
on
the
homeward
journey
and
marked
the
way
to
the
south
with
splinters
of
board
at
every
kilometre
our
distance
that
day
was
only
twelve
and
a
half
miles
our
dogs
especially
mine
looked
miserable
terribly
emaciated
it
was
clear
that
they
could
only
reach
at
the
farthest
even
then
the
homeward
journey
would
be
a
near
thing
we
decided
that
evening
to
be
satisfied
with
reaching
and
then
return
during
this
latter
part
of
the
trip
we
put
up
our
two
tents
front
to
front
so
that
the
openings
joined
in
this
way
we
were
able
to
send
the
food
direct
from
one
tent
to
the
other
without
going
outside
and
that
was
a
great
advantage
this
circumstance
led
to
a
radical
alteration
in
our
camping
system
and
gave
us
the
idea
of
the
best
tent
that
has
probably
yet
been
seen
in
the
polar
regions
as
we
lay
dozing
that
evening
in
our
thinking
of
everything
and
nothing
the
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
us
that
if
the
tents
were
sewed
together
as
they
now
stood
after
the
fronts
had
been
cut
away
we
should
get
one
tent
that
would
give
us
far
more
room
for
five
than
the
two
separate
tents
as
they
were
the
idea
was
followed
up
and
the
fruit
of
it
was
the
tent
we
used
on
the
journey
to
the
pole
an
ideal
tent
in
every
way
yes
circumstances
work
wonders
for
i
suppose
one
need
not
make
providence
responsible
for
these
trifles
on
march
we
reached
and
it
was
the
utmost
my
five
dogs
could
manage
indeed
as
will
shortly
be
seen
it
was
already
too
much
they
were
completely
worn
out
poor
beasts
this
is
the
only
dark
memory
of
my
stay
in
the
south
the
of
these
fine
animals
i
had
asked
more
of
them
than
they
were
capable
of
doing
my
consolation
is
that
i
did
not
spare
myself
either
to
set
this
sledge
weighing
nearly
half
a
ton
in
motion
with
dogs
was
no
child
play
and
setting
it
in
motion
was
not
always
the
whole
of
it
sometimes
one
had
to
push
it
forward
until
one
forced
the
dogs
to
move
the
whip
had
long
ago
lost
its
terrors
when
i
tried
to
use
it
they
only
crowded
together
and
got
their
heads
as
much
out
of
the
way
as
they
could
the
body
did
not
matter
so
much
many
a
time
too
i
failed
altogether
to
get
them
to
go
and
had
to
have
help
then
two
of
us
shoved
the
sledge
forward
while
the
third
used
the
whip
shouting
at
the
same
time
for
all
he
was
worth
how
hard
and
unfeeling
one
gets
under
such
conditions
how
one
whole
nature
may
be
changed
i
am
naturally
fond
of
all
animals
and
try
to
avoid
hurting
them
there
is
none
of
the
sportsman
instinct
in
me
it
would
never
occur
to
me
to
kill
an
animal
rats
and
flies
excepted
unless
it
was
to
support
life
i
think
i
can
say
that
in
normal
circumstances
i
loved
my
dogs
and
the
feeling
was
undoubtedly
mutual
but
the
circumstances
we
were
now
in
were
not
normal
or
was
it
perhaps
myself
who
was
not
normal
i
have
often
thought
since
that
such
was
really
the
case
the
daily
hard
work
and
the
object
i
would
not
give
up
had
made
me
brutal
for
brutal
i
was
when
i
forced
those
five
skeletons
to
haul
that
excessive
load
i
feel
it
yet
when
i
think
of
thor
a
big
fine
dog
uttering
his
plaintive
howls
on
the
march
a
thing
one
never
hears
a
dog
do
while
working
i
did
not
understand
what
it
meant
would
not
understand
perhaps
on
he
had
to
go
on
till
he
dropped
when
we
cut
him
open
we
found
that
his
whole
chest
was
one
large
abscess
the
altitude
at
noon
gave
us
and
we
therefore
went
the
other
six
miles
to
the
south
and
pitched
our
camp
at
in
we
had
latterly
had
a
constant
impression
that
the
barrier
was
rising
and
in
the
opinion
of
all
of
us
we
ought
now
to
have
been
at
a
height
of
about
feet
and
a
good
way
up
the
slope
leading
to
the
pole
personally
i
thought
the
ground
continued
to
rise
to
the
south
it
was
all
imagination
as
our
later
measurements
showed
we
had
now
reached
our
highest
latitude
that
autumn
and
had
reason
to
be
well
satisfied
we
laid
down
pounds
here
chiefly
pemmican
we
did
nothing
that
afternoon
only
rested
a
little
the
weather
was
brisk
clear
and
calm
the
distance
this
last
day
was
thirteen
and
a
half
miles
next
day
we
stayed
where
we
were
built
our
depot
and
marked
it
the
marking
was
done
in
the
same
way
as
in
with
this
difference
that
here
the
pieces
of
had
small
dark
blue
strips
of
cloth
fastened
to
the
top
which
made
them
easier
to
see
we
made
this
depot
very
secure
so
that
we
could
be
certain
it
would
stand
bad
weather
in
the
course
of
the
winter
i
also
left
my
sledge
behind
as
i
saw
the
impossibility
of
getting
it
home
with
my
team
besides
which
an
extra
sledge
at
this
point
might
possibly
be
useful
later
this
depot
feet
high
was
marked
with
a
bamboo
and
a
flag
on
the
top
so
that
it
could
be
seen
a
great
way
off
on
march
we
took
the
road
for
home
i
had
divided
my
dogs
between
wisting
and
hanssen
but
they
got
no
assistance
from
these
bags
of
bones
only
trouble
the
other
three
teams
had
held
out
well
there
was
hardly
anything
wrong
to
be
seen
with
hanssen
wisting
team
was
looked
upon
as
the
strongest
but
his
dogs
had
got
very
thin
however
they
did
their
work
well
wisting
sledge
had
also
been
overloaded
it
was
even
heavier
than
mine
johansen
animals
had
originally
been
regarded
as
the
weakest
but
they
proved
themselves
very
tough
in
the
they
were
no
racers
but
always
managed
to
scramble
along
somehow
their
motto
was
if
we
do
get
there
we
get
there
they
all
came
home
our
original
idea
was
that
the
homeward
journey
should
be
a
sort
of
pleasure
trip
that
we
should
sit
on
the
sledges
and
take
it
easy
but
in
the
circumstances
this
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
dogs
had
quite
enough
to
do
with
the
empty
sledges
the
same
day
we
reached
the
place
where
we
had
left
a
case
of
dogs
pemmican
and
camped
there
having
done
and
miles
the
weather
was
cold
and
raw
temperature
this
weather
took
the
last
remnant
of
strength
out
of
my
dogs
instead
of
resting
at
night
they
lay
huddled
together
and
freezing
it
was
pitiful
to
see
them
in
the
morning
they
had
to
be
lifted
up
and
put
on
their
feet
they
had
not
strength
enough
to
raise
themselves
when
they
had
staggered
on
a
little
way
and
got
some
warmth
into
their
bodies
they
seemed
to
be
rather
better
at
any
rate
they
could
keep
up
with
us
the
following
day
we
did
and
miles
temperature
on
the
we
passed
the
depot
in
the
big
pressure
ridges
to
the
east
were
easily
visible
and
we
got
a
good
bearing
which
would
possibly
come
in
useful
later
for
fixing
the
position
of
the
depot
that
day
we
did
and
miles
temperature
march
began
calm
and
fine
but
by
ten
in
the
morning
a
strong
wind
had
sprung
up
from
the
with
thick
driving
snow
so
as
not
to
lose
the
tracks
we
had
followed
so
far
we
pitched
our
camp
to
wait
till
the
storm
was
over
the
wind
howled
and
took
hold
of
the
tents
but
could
not
move
them
the
next
day
it
blew
just
as
hard
from
the
same
quarter
and
we
decided
to
wait
the
temperature
was
as
usual
with
the
wind
in
this
quarter
the
wind
did
not
moderate
till
on
the
when
we
were
able
to
make
a
start
what
a
sight
there
was
outside
how
were
we
going
to
begin
to
bring
order
out
of
this
chaos
the
sledges
were
completely
snowed
up
whips
and
harness
largely
eaten
up
it
was
a
nice
predicament
fortunately
we
were
well
supplied
with
alpine
rope
and
that
did
for
the
harness
spare
straps
came
in
for
but
the
whips
were
not
so
easy
to
make
good
hanssen
who
drove
first
was
bound
to
have
a
fairly
serviceable
whip
the
others
did
not
matter
so
much
though
it
was
rather
awkward
for
them
in
some
way
or
other
he
provided
himself
with
a
whip
that
answered
his
purpose
i
saw
one
of
the
others
armed
with
a
and
he
used
it
till
we
reached
framheim
at
first
the
dogs
were
much
afraid
of
this
monster
of
a
whip
but
they
soon
found
out
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
reach
them
with
the
pole
and
then
they
did
not
care
a
scrap
for
it
at
last
everything
seemed
to
be
in
order
and
then
we
only
had
to
get
the
dogs
up
and
in
their
places
several
of
them
were
so
indifferent
that
they
had
allowed
themselves
to
be
completely
snowed
under
but
one
by
one
we
got
them
out
and
put
them
on
their
feet
thor
however
refused
absolutely
it
was
impossible
to
get
him
to
stand
up
he
simply
lay
and
whined
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
put
an
end
to
him
and
as
we
had
no
firearms
it
had
to
be
done
with
an
axe
it
was
quite
successful
less
would
have
killed
him
wisting
took
the
carcass
on
his
sledge
to
take
it
to
the
next
camp
and
there
cut
it
up
the
day
was
bitterly
cold
fog
and
snow
with
a
southerly
breeze
temperature
we
were
lucky
enough
to
pick
up
our
old
tracks
of
the
southern
journey
and
could
follow
them
lurven
best
dog
fell
down
on
the
march
and
died
on
the
spot
he
was
one
of
those
dogs
who
had
to
work
their
hardest
the
whole
time
he
never
thought
of
shirking
for
a
moment
he
pulled
and
pulled
until
he
died
all
sentimental
feeling
had
vanished
long
ago
nobody
thought
of
giving
lurven
the
burial
he
deserved
what
was
left
of
him
skin
and
bones
was
cut
up
and
divided
among
his
companions
on
march
we
advanced
seventeen
miles
temperature
jens
one
of
my
gallant
three
musketeers
had
been
given
a
ride
all
day
on
wisting
sledge
he
was
too
weak
to
walk
any
longer
thor
was
to
have
been
divided
among
his
companions
that
evening
but
on
account
of
the
abscess
in
his
chest
we
changed
our
minds
he
was
put
into
an
empty
case
and
buried
during
the
night
we
were
wakened
by
a
fearful
noise
the
dogs
were
engaged
in
a
fierce
fight
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
from
their
howls
that
it
was
all
about
food
wisting
who
always
showed
himself
quickest
in
getting
out
of
the
bag
was
instantly
on
the
spot
and
then
it
was
seen
that
they
had
dug
up
thor
and
were
now
feasting
on
him
it
could
not
be
said
that
they
were
hard
to
please
in
the
way
of
food
associations
of
ideas
are
curious
things
sauce
hollandaise
suddenly
occurred
to
my
mind
wisting
buried
the
carcass
again
and
we
had
peace
for
the
rest
of
the
night
on
the
it
felt
bitterly
cold
with
and
a
sharp
snowstorm
from
the
lassesen
one
of
my
dogs
who
had
been
following
the
sledges
loose
was
left
behind
this
morning
at
the
we
did
not
miss
him
till
late
in
the
day
rasmus
one
of
the
three
musketeers
fell
like
lurven
he
pulled
till
he
died
jens
was
very
ill
could
not
touch
food
and
was
taken
on
wisting
sledge
we
reached
our
depot
in
that
evening
and
were
able
to
give
the
dogs
a
double
ration
the
distance
covered
was
and
miles
the
surface
about
here
had
changed
in
our
absence
great
high
were
now
to
be
seen
in
all
directions
on
one
of
the
cases
in
the
depot
bjaaland
had
written
a
short
message
besides
which
we
found
the
signal
arranged
with
hassel
a
block
of
snow
on
the
top
of
the
depot
to
show
that
they
had
gone
by
and
that
all
was
well
the
cold
continued
persistently
the
following
day
we
had
ola
and
jens
the
two
survivors
of
the
three
musketeers
had
to
be
put
an
end
to
that
day
it
was
a
shame
to
keep
them
alive
any
longer
and
with
them
the
three
musketeers
disappear
from
this
history
they
were
inseparable
friends
these
three
all
of
them
almost
entirely
black
at
flekkero
near
christiansand
where
we
kept
our
dogs
for
several
weeks
before
taking
them
on
board
rasmus
had
got
loose
and
was
impossible
to
catch
he
always
came
and
slept
with
his
two
friends
unless
he
was
being
hunted
we
did
not
succeed
in
catching
him
until
a
few
days
before
we
took
them
on
board
and
then
he
was
practically
wild
they
were
all
three
tied
up
on
the
bridge
on
board
where
i
was
to
have
my
team
and
from
that
day
my
closer
acquaintance
with
the
trio
is
dated
they
were
not
very
civilly
disposed
for
the
first
month
i
had
to
make
my
advances
with
a
long
stick
scratch
them
on
the
back
in
this
way
i
insinuated
myself
into
their
confidence
and
we
became
very
good
friends
but
they
were
a
terrible
power
on
board
wherever
these
three
villains
showed
themselves
there
was
always
a
row
they
loved
fighting
they
were
our
fastest
dogs
in
our
races
with
empty
sledges
when
we
were
driving
around
framheim
none
of
the
others
could
beat
these
three
i
was
always
sure
of
leaving
the
rest
behind
when
i
had
them
in
my
team
i
had
quite
given
up
lassesen
who
had
been
left
behind
that
morning
and
i
was
very
sorry
for
it
as
he
was
my
strongest
and
most
willing
beast
i
was
glad
therefore
when
he
suddenly
appeared
again
apparently
fit
and
well
we
presumed
that
he
had
dug
up
thor
again
and
finished
him
it
must
have
been
food
that
had
revived
him
from
home
he
did
remarkably
good
work
in
wisting
team
that
day
we
had
a
curious
experience
which
was
useful
for
the
future
the
compass
on
hanssen
sledge
which
had
always
been
reliability
itself
suddenly
began
to
go
wrong
at
any
rate
it
did
not
agree
with
the
observations
of
the
sun
which
we
fortunately
had
that
day
we
altered
our
course
in
accordance
with
our
bearings
in
the
evening
when
we
took
our
things
into
the
tent
the
housewife
with
scissors
pins
needles
had
lain
close
against
the
compass
no
wonder
it
turned
rebellious
on
march
we
had
a
breeze
from
the
and
rather
fresh
i
find
noted
in
my
diary
not
long
after
we
had
started
that
morning
hanssen
caught
sight
of
our
old
tracks
he
had
splendid
eyesight
saw
everything
long
before
anyone
else
bjaaland
also
had
good
sight
but
he
did
not
come
up
to
hanssen
the
way
home
was
now
straightforward
and
we
could
see
the
end
of
our
journey
meanwhile
a
gale
sprang
up
from
the
which
stopped
us
for
a
day
temperature
next
day
the
temperature
had
risen
as
usual
with
a
wind
we
woke
up
to
find
it
on
the
morning
of
the
that
was
a
difference
that
could
be
felt
and
not
an
unpleasant
one
we
had
had
more
than
enough
of
it
was
curious
weather
that
night
violent
gusts
of
wind
from
the
east
and
with
intervals
of
dead
calm
just
as
if
they
came
off
high
land
on
our
way
northward
that
day
we
passed
our
flag
no
and
then
knew
that
we
were
miles
from
framheim
pitched
our
camp
that
evening
at
miles
from
the
station
we
had
intended
to
take
this
stretch
of
the
way
in
two
days
seeing
how
tired
the
dogs
were
but
it
turned
out
otherwise
for
we
lost
our
old
tracks
during
the
forenoon
and
in
going
on
we
came
too
far
to
the
east
and
high
up
on
the
ridge
mentioned
before
suddenly
hanssen
sang
out
that
he
saw
something
funny
in
front
what
it
was
he
did
not
know
when
that
was
the
case
we
had
to
apply
to
the
one
who
saw
even
better
than
hanssen
and
that
was
my
glass
up
with
the
glass
then
the
good
old
glass
that
has
served
me
for
so
many
years
yes
there
was
certainly
something
curious
it
must
be
the
bay
of
whales
that
we
were
looking
down
into
but
what
were
those
black
things
moving
up
and
down
they
are
our
fellows
hunting
seals
someone
suggested
and
we
all
agreed
yes
of
course
it
was
so
clear
that
there
was
no
mistaking
it
i
can
see
a
sledge
and
another
and
there
a
third
we
nearly
had
tears
in
our
eyes
to
see
how
industrious
they
were
now
they
gone
no
there
they
are
again
strange
how
they
bob
up
and
down
those
fellows
it
proved
to
be
a
mirage
what
we
saw
was
framheim
with
all
its
tents
our
lads
we
were
sure
were
just
taking
a
comfortable
midday
nap
and
the
tears
we
were
nearly
shedding
were
withdrawn
now
we
could
survey
the
situation
calmly
there
lay
framheim
there
was
cape
man
head
and
there
west
cape
so
that
we
had
come
too
far
to
the
east
hurrah
for
framheim
seven
this
evening
shouted
one
yes
all
we
can
do
cried
another
and
away
we
went
we
set
our
course
straight
for
the
middle
of
the
bay
we
must
have
got
pretty
high
up
as
we
went
down
at
a
terrific
pace
this
was
more
than
the
forerunner
could
manage
he
flung
himself
on
a
sledge
as
it
went
by
i
had
a
glimpse
of
hanssen
who
was
busy
making
a
as
i
passed
the
soles
of
his
feet
were
then
very
prominent
i
myself
was
lying
on
hanssen
sledge
shaking
with
laughter
the
situation
was
too
comical
hanssen
picked
himself
up
again
just
as
the
last
sledge
was
passing
and
jumped
on
we
all
collected
in
a
mass
below
the
ridge
sledges
and
dogs
mixed
up
together
the
last
part
of
the
way
was
rather
hard
work
we
now
found
the
tracks
that
we
had
lost
early
in
the
day
one
dried
fish
after
another
stuck
up
out
of
the
snow
and
led
us
straight
on
we
reached
framheim
at
seven
in
the
evening
half
an
hour
earlier
than
we
had
thought
it
was
a
day
march
of
miles
not
so
bad
for
exhausted
dogs
lassesen
was
the
only
one
i
brought
home
out
of
my
team
odin
whom
i
had
sent
home
from
died
after
arriving
there
we
lost
altogether
eight
dogs
on
this
trip
two
of
died
immediately
after
coming
home
from
probably
the
cold
was
chiefly
responsible
i
feel
sure
that
with
a
reasonable
temperature
they
would
have
come
through
the
three
men
who
came
home
from
were
safe
and
sound
it
is
true
that
they
had
run
short
of
food
and
matches
the
last
day
but
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
they
had
the
dogs
since
their
return
they
had
shot
brought
in
cut
up
and
stowed
away
fifty
seals
a
very
good
piece
of
work
lindstrom
had
been
untiring
during
our
absence
he
had
put
everything
in
splendid
order
in
the
covered
passage
round
the
hut
he
had
cut
out
shelves
in
the
snow
and
filled
them
with
slices
of
seal
meat
here
alone
there
were
steaks
enough
for
the
whole
time
we
should
spend
here
on
the
outer
walls
of
the
hut
which
formed
the
other
side
of
the
passage
he
had
put
up
shelves
and
there
all
kinds
of
tinned
foods
were
stored
all
was
in
such
perfect
order
that
one
could
put
one
hand
on
what
one
wanted
in
the
dark
there
stood
salt
meat
and
bacon
by
themselves
and
there
were
there
you
read
the
label
on
a
tin
of
caramel
pudding
and
you
could
be
sure
that
the
rest
of
the
caramel
puddings
were
in
the
vicinity
quite
right
there
they
stood
in
a
row
like
a
company
of
soldiers
oh
lindstrom
how
long
will
this
order
last
well
that
was
of
course
a
question
i
put
to
myself
in
the
strictest
secrecy
let
me
turn
over
my
diary
on
thursday
july
i
find
the
following
entry
the
provision
passage
turns
our
days
into
chaotic
confusion
how
my
mind
goes
back
to
the
time
when
one
could
find
what
one
wanted
without
a
light
of
any
kind
if
you
put
out
your
hand
to
get
a
and
shut
it
again
you
could
be
sure
it
was
a
you
had
hold
of
and
so
it
was
throughout
department
but
now
good
heavens
i
am
ashamed
to
put
down
what
happened
to
me
yesterday
i
went
out
there
in
the
most
blissful
ignorance
of
the
state
of
things
now
prevailing
and
of
course
i
had
no
light
with
me
for
everything
had
its
place
i
put
out
my
hand
and
grasped
according
to
my
expectation
i
ought
to
have
been
in
possession
of
a
packet
of
candles
but
the
experiment
had
failed
that
which
i
held
in
my
hand
could
not
possibly
be
a
packet
of
candles
it
was
evident
from
the
feel
that
it
was
something
of
a
woollen
nature
i
laid
the
object
down
and
had
recourse
to
the
familiar
expedient
of
striking
a
match
do
you
know
what
it
was
a
dirty
old
pair
of
pants
and
do
you
want
to
know
where
i
found
it
well
it
was
between
the
butter
and
the
sweetmeats
that
was
mixing
things
up
with
a
vengeance
but
lindstrom
must
not
have
all
the
blame
in
this
passage
everyone
was
running
backwards
and
forwards
early
and
late
and
as
a
rule
in
the
dark
and
if
they
knocked
something
down
on
the
way
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
they
always
stopped
to
pick
it
up
again
then
he
had
painted
the
ceiling
of
the
room
white
how
cosy
it
looked
when
we
put
our
heads
in
that
evening
he
had
seen
us
a
long
way
off
on
the
barrier
the
rascal
and
now
the
table
was
laid
with
all
manner
of
dainties
but
and
the
smell
of
coffee
were
what
attracted
us
and
it
was
no
small
quantity
that
disappeared
that
evening
home
that
word
has
a
good
sound
wherever
it
may
be
at
sea
on
land
or
on
the
barrier
how
comfortable
we
made
ourselves
that
night
the
first
thing
we
did
now
was
to
dry
all
our
clothes
they
were
wet
through
this
was
not
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
we
had
to
stretch
the
garments
that
were
to
be
dried
on
lines
under
the
ceiling
of
the
room
so
that
we
could
not
dry
very
much
at
a
time
we
got
everything
ready
and
made
some
improvements
in
our
outfit
for
a
last
depot
journey
before
the
winter
set
in
this
time
the
destination
was
with
about
a
ton
and
a
quarter
of
fresh
seal
meat
how
immensely
important
it
would
be
on
the
main
journey
if
we
could
give
our
dogs
as
much
seal
meat
as
they
could
eat
at
we
all
saw
the
importance
of
this
and
were
eager
to
carry
it
out
we
set
to
work
once
more
at
the
outfit
the
last
trip
had
taught
us
much
that
was
new
thus
prestrud
and
johansen
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
double
was
preferable
to
two
single
ones
i
will
not
enter
upon
the
discussion
that
naturally
arose
on
this
point
the
double
bag
has
many
advantages
and
so
has
the
single
bag
let
it
therefore
remain
a
matter
of
taste
those
two
were
however
the
only
ones
who
made
this
alteration
hanssen
and
wisting
were
busy
carrying
out
the
new
idea
for
the
tents
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
had
finished
these
tents
are
as
much
like
a
snow
hut
in
form
as
they
can
be
instead
of
being
entirely
round
they
have
a
more
oblong
form
but
there
is
no
flat
side
and
the
wind
has
no
point
of
attack
our
personal
outfit
also
underwent
some
improvements
the
bay
of
whales
the
inner
part
of
it
from
man
head
to
west
cape
was
now
entirely
frozen
over
but
outside
the
sea
lay
immense
and
dark
our
house
was
now
completely
covered
with
snow
most
of
this
was
lindstrom
work
the
blizzard
had
not
helped
him
much
this
covering
with
snow
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
keeping
the
hut
snug
and
warm
our
dogs
in
number
mostly
look
like
pigs
getting
ready
for
christmas
even
the
famished
ones
that
made
the
last
trip
are
beginning
to
recover
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
how
quickly
such
an
animal
can
put
on
flesh
it
was
interesting
to
watch
the
of
the
dogs
from
the
last
trip
they
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
when
we
came
into
camp
they
might
have
been
there
all
the
time
it
is
true
they
were
rather
more
hungry
than
the
rest
the
meeting
between
lassesen
and
fix
was
comic
these
two
were
inseparable
friends
the
was
boss
and
the
other
obeyed
him
blindly
on
this
last
trip
i
had
left
fix
at
home
as
he
did
not
give
me
the
impression
of
being
quite
up
to
the
work
he
had
therefore
put
on
a
lot
of
flesh
big
eater
as
he
was
i
stood
and
watched
their
meeting
with
intense
curiosity
would
not
fix
take
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
assume
the
position
of
boss
in
such
a
mass
of
dogs
it
took
some
little
time
before
they
came
across
each
other
then
it
was
quite
touching
fix
ran
straight
up
to
the
other
began
to
lick
him
and
showed
every
sign
of
the
greatest
affection
and
joy
at
seeing
him
again
lassesen
on
his
part
took
it
all
with
a
very
superior
air
as
befits
a
boss
without
further
ceremony
he
rolled
his
fat
friend
in
the
snow
and
stood
over
him
for
a
while
no
doubt
to
let
him
know
that
he
was
still
absolute
master
beyond
dispute
poor
fix
he
looked
quite
crestfallen
but
this
did
not
last
long
he
soon
avenged
himself
on
the
other
knowing
that
he
could
tackle
him
with
safety
in
order
to
give
a
picture
of
our
life
as
it
was
at
this
time
i
will
quote
a
day
from
my
diary
march
saturday
beautiful
mild
weather
all
day
very
light
breeze
from
the
our
the
party
that
came
home
from
were
out
this
morning
and
brought
back
three
seals
this
makes
seals
altogether
since
their
return
on
march
we
have
now
quite
enough
fresh
meat
both
for
ourselves
and
for
all
our
dogs
we
get
to
like
more
and
more
every
day
we
should
all
be
glad
to
eat
it
at
every
meal
but
we
think
it
safer
to
make
a
little
variety
for
breakfast
eight
we
now
have
regularly
hot
cakes
with
jam
and
lindstrom
knows
how
to
prepare
them
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
surpassed
in
the
best
american
houses
in
addition
we
have
bread
butter
cheese
and
coffee
for
dinner
we
mostly
have
seal
meat
we
introduced
rather
more
tinned
meat
into
the
menu
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
sweets
in
the
form
of
tinned
californian
fruit
tarts
and
tinned
puddings
for
supper
with
whortleberry
jam
cheese
bread
butter
and
coffee
every
saturday
evening
a
glass
of
toddy
and
a
cigar
i
must
frankly
confess
that
i
have
never
lived
so
well
and
the
consequence
is
that
we
are
all
in
the
best
of
health
and
i
feel
certain
that
the
whole
enterprise
will
be
crowned
with
success
it
is
strange
indeed
here
to
go
outside
in
the
evening
and
see
the
cosy
warm
through
the
window
of
our
little
hut
and
to
feel
that
this
is
our
snug
comfortable
home
on
the
formidable
and
dreaded
barrier
all
our
little
puppies
as
round
as
christmas
pigs
are
wandering
about
outside
and
at
night
they
lie
in
crowds
about
the
door
they
never
take
shelter
under
a
roof
at
night
they
must
be
hardy
beasts
some
of
them
are
so
fat
that
they
waddle
just
like
geese
the
aurora
australis
was
seen
for
the
first
time
on
the
evening
of
march
it
was
composed
of
shafts
and
bands
and
extended
from
the
to
the
through
the
zenith
the
light
was
pale
green
and
red
we
see
many
fine
sunsets
here
unique
in
the
splendour
of
their
colour
no
doubt
the
surroundings
in
this
fairyland
of
blue
and
white
do
much
to
increase
their
beauty
the
departure
of
the
last
depot
journey
was
fixed
for
friday
march
a
few
days
before
the
party
went
out
on
the
ice
and
shot
six
seals
for
the
depot
they
were
cleaned
and
all
superfluous
parts
removed
so
that
they
should
not
be
too
heavy
the
weight
of
these
six
seals
was
then
estimated
at
about
pounds
on
march
at
the
last
depot
party
started
it
consisted
of
seven
men
six
sledges
and
dogs
i
did
not
go
myself
this
time
they
had
the
most
beautiful
weather
to
begin
their
journey
dead
calm
and
brilliantly
clear
at
seven
that
morning
when
i
came
out
of
the
hut
i
saw
a
sight
so
beautiful
that
i
shall
never
forget
it
the
whole
surroundings
of
the
station
lay
in
deep
dark
shadow
in
lee
of
the
ridge
to
the
east
but
the
sun
rays
reached
over
the
barrier
farther
to
the
north
and
there
the
barrier
lay
golden
red
bathed
in
the
morning
sun
it
glittered
and
shone
red
and
gold
against
the
jagged
row
of
mighty
masses
of
ice
that
bounds
our
barrier
on
the
north
a
spirit
of
peace
breathed
over
all
but
from
framheim
the
smoke
ascended
quietly
into
the
air
and
proclaimed
that
the
spell
of
thousands
of
years
was
broken
the
sledges
were
heavily
loaded
when
they
went
southward
i
saw
them
slowly
disappear
over
the
ridge
by
the
it
was
a
quiet
time
that
followed
after
all
the
work
and
hurry
of
preparation
not
that
we
two
who
stayed
at
home
sat
still
doing
nothing
we
made
good
use
of
the
time
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
put
our
meteorological
station
in
order
on
april
all
the
instruments
were
in
use
in
the
kitchen
were
hung
our
two
mercury
barometers
four
aneroids
barograph
thermograph
and
one
thermometer
they
were
placed
in
a
corner
farthest
from
the
stove
we
had
no
house
as
yet
for
our
outside
instruments
but
the
went
to
work
to
prepare
one
as
quickly
as
possible
and
so
nimble
were
his
hands
that
when
the
depot
party
returned
there
was
the
finest
standing
ready
on
the
hill
painted
white
so
that
it
shone
a
long
way
off
the
was
a
work
of
art
constructed
by
our
able
engineer
sundbeck
no
factory
could
have
supplied
a
more
handsome
or
tasteful
one
in
the
we
had
a
thermograph
hygrometer
and
thermometers
observations
were
made
at
and
when
i
was
at
home
i
took
them
and
when
i
was
away
it
was
lindstrom
work
on
the
night
before
april
something
or
other
fell
down
in
the
kitchen
according
to
lindstrom
a
sure
sign
that
the
travellers
might
be
expected
home
that
day
and
sure
enough
at
noon
we
caught
sight
of
them
up
at
the
they
came
across
at
such
a
pace
that
the
snow
was
scattered
all
round
them
and
in
an
time
we
had
them
back
they
had
much
to
tell
us
in
the
first
place
that
everything
had
been
duly
taken
to
the
depot
in
then
they
surprised
me
with
an
account
of
a
fearfully
crevassed
piece
of
surface
that
they
had
come
upon
and
a
half
miles
from
the
station
where
they
had
lost
two
dogs
this
was
very
strange
we
had
now
traversed
this
stretch
of
surface
four
times
without
being
particularly
troubled
with
anything
of
this
sort
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
when
they
thought
the
whole
surface
was
as
solid
as
a
rock
they
found
themselves
in
danger
of
coming
to
grief
altogether
in
thick
weather
they
had
gone
too
far
to
the
west
then
instead
of
arriving
at
the
ridge
as
we
had
done
before
they
came
down
into
the
valley
and
there
found
a
surface
so
dangerous
that
they
nearly
had
a
catastrophe
it
was
a
precisely
similar
piece
of
surface
to
that
already
mentioned
to
the
south
of
but
full
of
small
hummocks
everywhere
the
ground
was
apparently
solid
enough
and
this
was
just
the
most
dangerous
thing
about
it
but
as
they
were
crossing
it
large
pieces
of
the
surface
fell
away
just
in
rear
of
them
disclosing
bottomless
crevasses
big
enough
to
swallow
up
everything
men
dogs
and
sledges
with
some
difficulty
they
got
out
of
this
ugly
place
by
steering
to
the
east
now
we
knew
of
it
and
we
should
certainly
be
very
careful
not
to
come
that
way
again
in
spite
of
this
however
we
afterwards
had
an
even
more
serious
encounter
with
this
nasty
trap
one
dog
had
also
been
left
behind
on
the
way
it
had
a
wound
on
one
of
its
feet
and
could
not
be
harnessed
in
the
sledge
it
had
been
let
loose
a
few
miles
to
the
north
of
the
depot
doubtless
with
the
idea
that
it
would
follow
the
sledges
but
the
dog
seemed
to
have
taken
another
view
of
the
matter
and
was
never
seen
again
there
were
some
who
thought
that
the
dog
had
probably
returned
to
the
depot
and
was
now
passing
its
days
in
ease
and
luxury
among
the
laboriously
transported
seals
carcasses
i
must
confess
that
this
idea
was
not
very
attractive
to
me
there
was
indeed
a
possibility
that
such
a
thing
had
happened
and
that
the
greater
part
of
our
seal
meat
might
be
missing
when
we
wanted
it
but
our
fears
proved
groundless
cook
that
was
the
name
of
the
dog
we
had
a
peary
as
well
of
course
was
gone
for
ever
the
improved
outfit
was
in
every
way
successful
praises
of
the
new
tent
were
heard
on
every
hand
and
prestrud
and
johansen
were
in
the
seventh
heaven
over
their
double
i
fancy
the
others
were
very
well
satisfied
with
their
single
ones
and
with
this
the
most
important
part
of
the
autumn
work
came
to
an
end
the
foundation
was
solidly
laid
now
we
had
only
to
raise
the
edifice
let
us
briefly
sum
up
the
work
accomplished
between
january
and
april
the
complete
erection
of
the
station
with
accommodation
for
nine
men
for
several
years
provision
of
fresh
meat
for
nine
men
and
a
hundred
and
fifteen
dogs
for
half
a
year
the
weight
of
the
seals
killed
amounted
to
about
tons
and
finally
the
distribution
of
tons
of
supplies
in
the
depots
in
latitudes
and
the
depot
in
contained
seal
meat
dogs
pemmican
biscuits
butter
chocolate
matches
and
paraffin
besides
a
quantity
of
outfit
the
total
weight
of
this
depot
was
pounds
in
ton
of
pemmican
in
pemmican
both
for
men
and
dogs
biscuits
chocolate
and
paraffin
besides
a
quantity
of
outfit
the
weight
of
this
depot
amounted
to
pounds
chapter
vii
preparing
for
winter
winter
i
believe
most
people
look
upon
winter
as
a
time
of
storms
cold
and
discomfort
they
look
forward
to
it
with
sadness
and
bow
before
the
inevitable
providence
ordains
it
so
the
prospect
of
a
ball
or
two
cheers
them
up
a
little
and
makes
the
horizon
somewhat
brighter
but
all
the
same
darkness
and
cold
ugh
no
let
us
have
summer
they
say
what
my
comrades
thought
about
the
winter
that
was
approaching
i
can
not
say
for
my
part
i
looked
forward
to
it
with
pleasure
when
i
stood
out
there
on
the
snow
hill
and
saw
the
light
shining
out
of
the
kitchen
window
there
came
over
me
an
indescribable
feeling
of
comfort
and
and
the
blacker
and
more
stormy
the
winter
night
might
be
the
greater
would
be
this
feeling
of
inside
our
snug
little
house
i
see
the
questioning
look
and
know
what
he
will
say
but
were
you
awfully
afraid
the
barrier
would
break
off
and
float
you
out
to
sea
i
will
answer
this
question
as
frankly
as
possible
with
one
exception
we
were
all
at
this
time
of
the
opinion
that
the
part
of
the
barrier
on
which
the
hut
stood
rested
on
land
so
that
any
fear
of
a
sea
voyage
was
quite
superfluous
as
to
the
one
who
thought
we
were
afloat
i
think
i
can
say
very
definitely
that
he
was
not
afraid
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
gradually
came
round
to
the
same
view
as
the
rest
of
us
if
a
general
is
to
win
a
battle
he
must
always
be
prepared
if
his
opponent
makes
a
move
he
must
see
that
he
is
able
to
make
a
everything
must
be
planned
in
advance
and
nothing
unforeseen
we
were
in
the
same
position
we
had
to
consider
beforehand
what
the
future
might
bring
and
make
our
arrangements
accordingly
while
there
was
time
when
the
sun
had
left
us
and
the
dark
period
had
set
in
it
would
be
too
late
what
first
of
all
claimed
our
attention
and
set
our
collective
to
work
was
the
female
sex
there
was
no
peace
for
us
even
on
the
barrier
what
happened
was
that
the
entire
feminine
population
eleven
in
number
had
thought
fit
to
appear
in
a
condition
usually
considered
interesting
but
which
under
the
circumstances
we
by
no
means
regarded
in
that
light
our
hands
were
indeed
full
enough
without
this
what
was
to
be
done
great
deliberation
eleven
maternity
hospitals
seemed
rather
a
large
order
but
we
knew
by
experience
that
they
all
required
first
aid
if
we
left
several
of
them
in
the
same
place
there
would
be
a
terrible
scene
and
it
would
end
in
their
eating
up
each
pups
for
what
had
happened
only
a
few
days
before
kaisa
a
big
bitch
had
taken
a
pup
when
no
one
was
looking
and
made
a
meal
off
it
when
we
arrived
we
saw
the
tip
of
its
tail
disappearing
so
there
was
not
much
to
be
done
now
it
fortunately
happened
that
one
of
the
became
vacant
as
prestrud
team
was
divided
among
the
other
tents
as
forerunner
he
had
no
use
for
dogs
here
with
a
little
contrivance
we
could
get
two
of
them
disposed
of
a
dividing
wall
could
be
put
up
when
first
laying
out
the
station
we
had
taken
this
side
of
life
into
consideration
and
a
hospital
in
the
shape
of
a
tent
had
been
erected
but
this
was
not
nearly
enough
we
then
had
recourse
to
the
material
of
which
there
is
such
superabundance
in
these
parts
of
the
we
erected
a
splendid
big
besides
this
lindstrom
in
his
leisure
hours
had
erected
a
little
building
which
was
ready
when
we
returned
from
the
second
depot
journey
we
had
none
of
us
asked
what
it
was
for
but
now
we
knew
lindstrom
kind
heart
with
these
arrangements
at
our
disposal
we
were
able
to
face
the
winter
camilla
the
sly
old
fox
had
taken
things
in
time
she
knew
what
it
meant
to
bring
up
children
in
the
dark
and
in
truth
it
was
no
pleasure
she
had
therefore
made
haste
and
was
ready
as
soon
as
the
original
hospital
was
prepared
she
could
now
look
forward
to
the
future
with
calmness
in
the
last
rays
of
the
disappearing
sun
when
darkness
set
in
her
young
ones
would
be
able
to
look
after
themselves
camilla
by
the
way
had
her
own
views
of
bringing
up
her
children
what
there
was
about
the
hospital
that
she
did
not
like
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
certain
that
she
preferred
any
other
place
it
was
no
rare
thing
to
come
across
camilla
in
a
tearing
gale
and
a
temperature
twenty
below
zero
with
one
of
her
offspring
in
her
mouth
she
was
going
out
to
look
for
a
new
place
meanwhile
the
three
others
who
had
to
wait
were
shrieking
and
howling
the
places
she
chose
were
not
as
a
rule
such
as
we
should
connect
with
the
idea
of
comfort
a
case
for
instance
standing
on
its
side
and
fully
exposed
to
the
wind
or
behind
a
stack
of
planks
with
a
draught
coming
through
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
factory
chimney
but
if
she
liked
it
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
if
the
family
were
left
alone
in
such
a
place
she
would
spend
some
days
there
before
moving
on
again
she
never
returned
to
the
hospital
voluntarily
but
it
was
not
a
rare
thing
to
see
johansen
who
was
guardian
to
the
family
hauling
off
the
lady
and
as
many
of
her
little
ones
as
he
could
get
hold
of
in
a
hurry
they
then
disappeared
into
the
hospital
with
words
of
encouragement
at
the
same
time
we
introduced
a
new
order
of
things
with
our
dogs
hitherto
we
had
been
obliged
to
keep
them
tied
up
on
account
of
otherwise
they
went
off
by
themselves
and
ravaged
there
were
certain
individuals
who
specially
distinguished
themselves
in
this
way
like
wisting
major
he
was
a
born
hunter
afraid
of
nothing
then
there
was
hassel
svarten
but
a
good
point
about
him
was
that
he
went
off
alone
while
the
major
always
had
a
whole
staff
with
him
they
usually
came
back
with
their
faces
all
covered
with
blood
to
put
a
stop
to
this
sport
we
had
been
obliged
to
keep
them
fast
but
now
that
the
seals
had
left
us
we
could
let
them
loose
naturally
the
first
use
to
which
they
put
their
liberty
was
fighting
in
the
course
of
time
for
reasons
impossible
to
discover
bitter
feelings
and
hatred
had
arisen
between
certain
of
the
dogs
and
now
they
were
offered
an
opportunity
of
deciding
which
was
the
stronger
and
they
seized
upon
it
with
avidity
but
after
a
time
their
manners
improved
and
a
regular
fight
became
a
rarity
there
were
of
course
a
few
who
could
never
see
each
other
without
flying
at
one
another
throats
like
lassesen
and
hans
for
instance
but
we
knew
their
ways
and
could
keep
an
eye
on
them
the
dogs
soon
knew
their
respective
tents
and
their
places
in
them
they
were
let
loose
as
soon
as
we
came
out
in
the
morning
and
were
chained
up
again
in
the
evening
when
they
were
to
be
fed
they
got
so
used
to
this
that
we
never
had
much
trouble
they
all
reported
themselves
cheerfully
when
we
came
in
the
evening
to
fasten
them
up
and
every
animal
knew
his
own
master
and
tent
and
knew
at
once
what
was
expected
of
him
with
howls
of
delight
the
various
dogs
collected
about
their
masters
and
made
for
the
tents
in
great
jubilation
we
kept
up
this
arrangement
the
whole
time
their
food
consisted
of
seal
flesh
and
blubber
one
day
and
dried
fish
the
next
as
a
rule
both
disappeared
without
any
objection
though
they
certainly
preferred
the
seal
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
winter
we
had
carcasses
of
seals
lying
on
the
slope
and
these
were
usually
a
centre
of
great
interest
the
spot
might
be
regarded
as
the
of
framheim
and
it
was
not
always
a
peaceful
one
the
customers
were
many
and
the
demand
great
so
that
sometimes
lively
scenes
took
place
our
own
store
of
flesh
was
in
the
about
a
hundred
seals
had
been
cut
up
and
stacked
there
as
already
mentioned
we
built
a
wall
of
snow
two
yards
high
round
this
tent
as
a
protection
against
the
dogs
although
they
had
as
much
to
eat
as
they
wanted
and
although
they
knew
they
were
not
allowed
to
try
to
get
in
or
possibly
this
prohibition
was
just
the
incentive
they
were
always
casting
longing
eyes
in
that
direction
and
the
number
of
in
the
wall
spoke
eloquently
of
what
went
on
when
we
were
not
looking
snuppesen
in
particular
could
not
keep
herself
away
from
that
wall
and
she
was
extremely
light
and
agile
so
that
she
had
the
best
chance
she
never
engaged
in
this
sport
by
herself
but
always
enticed
out
her
attendant
cavaliers
fix
and
lasse
these
however
were
less
active
and
had
to
be
content
with
looking
on
while
she
jumped
inside
the
wall
which
she
only
succeeded
in
doing
once
or
twice
they
ran
round
yelling
as
soon
as
we
heard
their
howls
we
knew
exactly
what
was
happening
and
one
of
us
went
out
armed
with
a
stick
it
required
some
cunning
to
catch
her
in
the
act
for
as
soon
as
one
approached
her
cavaliers
stopped
howling
and
she
understood
that
something
was
wrong
her
red
fox
head
could
then
be
seen
over
the
top
looking
round
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
she
did
not
jump
into
the
arms
of
the
man
with
the
stick
but
as
a
rule
he
did
not
give
up
until
he
had
caught
and
punished
her
fix
and
lasse
also
had
their
turns
it
was
true
they
had
done
nothing
wrong
but
they
might
they
knew
this
and
watched
snuppesen
chastisement
at
a
distance
the
tent
where
we
kept
the
dried
fish
stood
always
open
none
of
them
attempted
to
take
fish
the
sun
continued
its
daily
course
lower
and
lower
we
did
not
see
much
of
it
after
the
return
from
the
last
depot
journey
on
april
it
came
and
vanished
again
at
once
easter
came
round
on
the
barrier
as
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
and
had
to
be
kept
holidays
with
us
were
marked
by
eating
a
little
more
than
usual
there
was
no
other
sign
we
did
not
dress
differently
nor
did
we
introduce
any
other
change
in
the
evening
of
a
holiday
we
generally
had
a
little
gramophone
a
glass
of
toddy
and
a
cigar
but
we
were
careful
with
the
gramophone
we
knew
we
should
soon
get
tired
of
it
if
we
used
it
too
often
therefore
we
only
brought
it
out
on
rare
occasions
but
we
enjoyed
its
music
all
the
more
when
we
heard
it
when
easter
was
over
a
sigh
of
relief
escaped
us
all
these
holidays
are
always
tiring
they
are
tedious
enough
in
places
which
have
more
amusements
to
offer
than
the
barrier
but
here
they
were
insufferably
long
our
manner
of
life
was
now
completely
in
order
and
everything
worked
easily
and
well
the
chief
work
of
the
winter
would
be
the
perfecting
of
our
outfit
for
the
coming
sledge
journey
to
the
south
our
object
was
to
reach
the
pole
everything
else
was
secondary
the
meteorological
observations
were
in
full
swing
and
arranged
for
the
winter
observations
were
made
at
and
we
were
so
that
i
could
not
spare
anyone
for
night
duty
besides
which
living
as
we
did
in
a
small
space
it
would
have
a
disturbing
effect
if
there
were
always
someone
moving
about
there
would
never
be
any
peace
my
special
aim
was
that
everyone
should
be
happy
and
comfortable
so
that
when
the
spring
came
we
might
all
be
fresh
and
well
and
eager
to
take
up
the
final
task
it
was
not
my
intention
that
we
should
spend
the
winter
in
idleness
far
from
it
to
be
contented
and
well
a
man
must
always
be
occupied
i
therefore
expected
everyone
to
be
busy
during
the
hours
that
were
set
apart
for
work
at
the
end
of
the
day
each
man
was
free
to
do
what
he
pleased
we
had
also
to
keep
some
sort
of
order
and
tidiness
as
well
as
circumstances
permitted
it
was
therefore
decided
that
each
of
us
should
take
a
week
duty
as
orderly
this
duty
consisted
in
sweeping
the
floor
every
morning
emptying
etc
to
secure
plenty
of
ventilation
especially
in
our
a
rule
was
made
that
no
one
might
have
anything
under
his
bunk
except
the
boots
he
had
in
wear
each
man
had
two
pegs
to
hang
his
clothes
on
and
this
was
sufficient
for
what
he
was
wearing
every
day
all
superfluous
clothing
was
stuffed
into
our
and
put
out
in
this
way
we
succeeded
in
maintaining
some
sort
of
tidiness
in
any
case
the
worst
of
the
dirt
was
got
rid
of
whether
a
fastidious
housekeeper
would
have
found
everything
in
order
is
doubtful
everyone
had
his
regular
work
prestrud
with
the
assistance
of
johansen
looked
after
the
astronomical
observations
and
the
pendulum
observations
hassel
was
set
in
authority
over
coal
wood
and
paraffin
he
was
responsible
for
the
supply
lasting
out
as
manager
of
the
framheim
coal
and
wood
business
he
of
course
received
the
title
of
director
and
this
dignity
might
possibly
have
gone
to
his
head
if
the
occupation
of
had
not
been
combined
with
it
but
it
was
besides
receiving
the
orders
he
had
to
deliver
the
goods
and
he
discharged
his
duties
with
distinction
he
succeeded
in
hoodwinking
his
largest
customer
lindstrom
to
such
an
extent
that
in
the
course
of
the
winter
he
saved
a
good
deal
of
coal
hanssen
had
to
keep
the
depot
in
order
and
bring
in
everything
we
required
wisting
had
charge
of
the
whole
outfit
and
was
responsible
that
nothing
was
touched
without
permission
bjaaland
and
stubberud
were
to
look
after
the
and
the
passage
round
the
hut
lindstrom
was
occupied
in
the
kitchen
the
hardest
and
most
thankless
work
on
an
expedition
like
this
no
one
says
anything
so
long
as
the
food
is
good
but
let
the
cook
be
unlucky
and
burn
the
soup
one
day
and
he
will
hear
something
lindstrom
had
the
excellent
disposition
of
a
man
who
is
never
put
out
whatever
people
might
say
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
on
april
we
saw
the
sun
for
the
last
time
since
it
then
went
below
our
horizon
the
ridge
to
the
north
it
was
intensely
red
and
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
flame
which
did
not
disappear
altogether
until
the
now
everything
was
well
as
far
as
the
hut
was
concerned
it
could
not
be
better
but
the
which
it
was
originally
intended
to
use
as
a
workroom
soon
proved
too
small
dark
and
cold
besides
which
all
the
traffic
went
through
that
room
so
that
work
would
be
constantly
interrupted
or
stopped
altogether
at
times
except
this
dark
hole
we
had
no
workroom
and
we
had
a
lot
of
work
to
do
of
course
we
might
use
our
but
then
we
should
be
in
each
other
way
all
day
long
nor
would
it
be
a
good
plan
to
give
up
the
only
room
where
we
could
sometimes
find
peace
and
comfort
to
be
a
workshop
i
know
it
is
the
usual
custom
to
do
so
but
i
have
always
found
it
a
bad
arrangement
now
indeed
we
were
at
our
wits
end
but
circumstances
once
more
came
to
our
aid
for
we
may
just
as
well
confess
it
we
had
forgotten
to
bring
out
a
tool
which
is
a
commonplace
necessity
on
a
polar
expedition
namely
a
a
expedition
as
ours
was
to
a
certain
extent
ought
to
have
at
least
twelve
strong
thick
iron
spades
we
had
none
we
had
two
remnants
but
they
did
not
help
us
very
far
fortunately
however
we
had
a
very
good
solid
iron
plate
with
us
and
now
bjaaland
stepped
into
the
breach
and
made
a
whole
dozen
of
the
very
best
spades
stubberud
managed
the
handles
and
they
might
all
have
been
turned
out
by
a
big
factory
this
circumstance
had
very
important
results
for
our
future
as
will
be
seen
if
we
had
had
the
shovels
with
us
from
the
start
we
should
have
cleared
the
snow
away
from
our
door
every
morning
like
tidy
people
but
as
we
had
none
the
snow
had
increased
daily
before
our
door
and
before
bjaaland
was
ready
with
the
spades
had
formed
a
drift
extending
from
the
entrance
along
the
western
side
of
the
house
this
which
was
as
big
as
the
house
itself
naturally
caused
some
frowns
when
one
morning
all
hands
turned
out
armed
with
the
new
shovels
to
make
a
clearance
as
we
stood
there
afraid
to
begin
one
of
us
it
must
have
been
lindstrom
or
hanssen
perhaps
or
was
it
myself
well
it
does
matter
one
of
us
had
the
bright
idea
of
taking
nature
in
hand
and
working
with
her
instead
of
against
her
the
proposal
was
that
we
should
dig
out
a
shop
in
the
big
and
put
it
in
direct
communication
with
the
hut
this
was
no
sooner
suggested
than
adopted
unanimously
and
now
began
a
work
of
tunnelling
which
lasted
a
good
while
for
one
excavation
led
to
another
and
we
did
not
stop
until
we
had
a
whole
underground
village
probably
one
of
the
most
interesting
works
ever
executed
round
a
polar
station
let
us
begin
with
the
morning
when
we
thrust
the
first
spade
into
the
drift
it
was
thursday
april
while
three
men
went
to
work
to
dig
right
into
the
drift
from
the
hut
door
westward
three
more
were
busy
connecting
it
with
the
hut
this
was
done
by
stretching
boards
the
same
that
we
had
used
on
the
fram
as
a
false
deck
for
the
dogs
from
the
drift
up
to
the
roof
of
the
the
open
part
between
the
drift
and
the
on
the
northern
side
was
filled
up
entirely
into
a
solid
wall
which
went
up
to
join
the
roof
that
had
just
been
put
on
the
space
between
the
and
the
drift
on
the
south
wall
was
left
open
as
an
exit
but
now
we
had
the
building
fever
on
us
and
one
ambitious
project
succeeded
another
thus
we
agreed
to
dig
a
passage
the
whole
length
of
the
drift
and
terminate
it
by
a
large
in
which
we
were
to
have
a
vapour
bath
that
was
something
like
a
plan
a
vapour
bath
in
hanssen
builder
by
profession
went
to
work
at
it
he
built
it
quite
small
and
solid
and
extended
it
downward
so
that
when
at
last
it
was
finished
it
measured
feet
from
floor
to
roof
here
we
should
have
plenty
of
room
to
fit
up
a
vapour
bath
meanwhile
the
tunnellers
were
advancing
we
could
hear
the
sound
of
their
pickaxes
and
spades
coming
nearer
and
nearer
this
was
too
much
for
hanssen
as
he
had
now
finished
the
hut
he
set
to
work
to
dig
his
way
to
the
others
and
when
he
begins
a
thing
it
does
not
take
him
very
long
we
could
hear
the
two
parties
continually
nearing
each
other
the
excitement
increases
will
they
meet
or
are
they
digging
side
by
side
on
different
lines
the
simplon
mont
cenis
and
other
engineering
works
flashed
through
my
brain
if
they
were
going
to
hit
it
off
we
must
be
hullo
i
was
interrupted
in
my
studies
by
a
glistening
face
which
was
thrust
through
the
wall
just
as
i
was
going
to
dig
my
spade
into
it
it
was
wisting
pioneer
of
the
framheim
tunnel
he
had
good
reason
to
be
glad
he
escaped
with
his
nose
safe
and
sound
in
another
instant
i
should
have
had
it
on
my
spade
it
was
a
fine
sight
this
long
white
passage
ending
in
the
high
shining
dome
as
we
dug
forward
we
dug
down
at
the
same
time
so
as
not
to
weaken
the
roof
there
was
plenty
to
take
down
below
the
barrier
was
deep
enough
when
this
was
finished
we
began
to
work
on
the
carpenter
shop
this
had
to
be
dug
considerably
deeper
as
the
drift
was
rounded
off
a
little
to
the
side
we
therefore
dug
first
into
the
drift
and
then
right
down
as
far
as
i
remember
we
went
feet
down
into
the
barrier
here
the
shop
was
made
roomy
with
space
enough
for
both
carpenters
and
length
enough
for
our
sledges
the
was
cut
out
in
the
wall
and
covered
with
boards
the
workshop
terminated
at
its
western
end
in
a
little
room
where
the
carpenters
kept
their
smaller
tools
a
broad
stairway
cut
in
the
snow
and
covered
with
boards
led
from
the
shop
into
the
passage
as
soon
as
the
workshop
was
finished
the
workmen
moved
in
and
established
themselves
under
the
name
of
the
carpenters
union
here
the
whole
sledging
outfit
for
the
polar
journey
was
remodelled
opposite
the
carpenters
came
the
smithy
dug
to
the
same
depth
as
the
other
this
was
less
used
on
the
other
side
of
the
smithy
nearer
to
the
hut
a
deep
hole
was
dug
to
receive
all
the
waste
water
from
the
kitchen
between
the
union
and
the
entrance
to
the
opposite
the
ascent
to
the
barrier
we
built
a
little
room
which
properly
speaking
deserves
a
very
detailed
explanation
but
for
want
of
space
this
must
be
deferred
till
later
the
ascent
to
the
barrier
which
had
been
left
open
while
all
these
works
were
in
progress
was
now
closed
by
a
contrivance
which
is
also
worth
mentioning
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
apparently
have
never
learnt
to
shut
a
door
after
them
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
you
generally
find
at
least
one
who
suffers
from
this
defect
how
many
would
there
be
among
us
who
numbered
nine
it
is
no
use
asking
a
victim
of
this
complaint
to
shut
the
door
after
him
he
is
simply
incapable
of
doing
it
i
was
not
yet
well
enough
acquainted
with
my
companions
as
regards
the
question
and
in
order
to
be
on
the
safe
side
we
might
just
as
well
put
up
a
door
this
was
done
by
stubberud
by
fixing
the
into
the
wall
in
an
oblique
position
just
like
a
at
home
now
the
door
could
not
stay
open
it
had
to
fall
to
i
was
glad
when
i
saw
it
finished
we
were
secured
against
an
invasion
of
dogs
four
snow
steps
covered
with
boards
led
from
the
door
down
into
the
passage
in
addition
to
all
these
new
rooms
we
had
thus
gained
an
extra
protection
for
our
house
while
this
work
was
in
progress
our
had
his
hands
full
the
clockwork
mechanism
of
the
thermograph
had
gone
wrong
the
spindle
was
broken
i
believe
this
was
particularly
annoying
because
this
thermograph
had
been
working
so
well
in
low
temperatures
the
other
thermograph
had
evidently
been
constructed
with
a
view
to
the
tropics
at
any
rate
it
would
not
go
in
the
cold
our
has
one
method
of
dealing
with
all
instruments
almost
without
exception
he
puts
them
in
the
oven
and
stokes
up
the
fire
this
time
it
worked
remarkably
well
since
it
enabled
him
to
ascertain
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
thing
was
useless
the
thermograph
would
not
work
in
the
cold
meanwhile
he
got
it
cleared
of
all
the
old
oil
that
stuck
to
it
everywhere
on
wheels
and
pins
like
then
it
was
hung
up
to
the
kitchen
ceiling
the
temperature
there
may
possibly
revive
it
and
make
it
think
it
is
in
the
tropics
in
this
way
we
shall
have
the
temperature
of
the
galley
registered
and
later
on
we
shall
probably
be
able
to
reckon
up
what
we
have
had
for
dinner
in
the
course
of
the
week
whether
professor
mohn
will
be
overjoyed
with
this
result
is
another
question
which
the
and
director
did
not
care
to
go
into
besides
these
instruments
we
have
a
hygrograph
we
are
well
supplied
but
this
takes
one
of
us
out
of
doors
once
in
the
hours
lindstrom
has
cleaned
it
and
oiled
it
and
set
it
going
in
spite
of
this
at
three
in
the
morning
it
comes
to
a
stop
but
i
have
never
seen
lindstrom
beaten
yet
after
many
consultations
he
was
given
the
task
of
trying
to
construct
a
thermograph
out
of
the
hygrograph
and
the
disabled
thermograph
this
was
just
the
job
for
him
the
production
he
showed
me
a
few
hours
later
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
what
would
steen
say
do
you
know
what
it
was
well
it
was
an
old
circulating
inside
the
thermograph
case
heavens
what
an
insult
to
the
meteorological
instruments
i
was
thunderstruck
thinking
of
course
that
the
man
was
making
a
fool
of
me
i
had
carefully
studied
his
face
all
the
time
to
find
the
key
to
this
riddle
and
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
weep
lindstrom
face
was
certainly
serious
enough
if
it
afforded
a
measure
of
the
situation
i
believe
tears
would
have
been
appropriate
but
when
my
eye
fell
upon
the
thermograph
and
read
stavanger
preserving
finest
rissoles
i
could
contain
myself
no
longer
the
comical
side
of
it
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
when
my
laughter
was
subdued
i
heard
the
explanation
the
cylinder
did
not
fit
so
he
had
tried
the
tin
and
it
went
splendidly
the
worked
very
well
as
far
as
but
then
it
gave
up
our
forces
were
now
divided
into
two
working
parties
one
of
them
was
to
dig
out
some
forty
seals
we
had
lying
about
feet
under
the
snow
this
took
two
days
the
heavy
seals
carcasses
hard
as
flint
were
difficult
to
deal
with
the
dogs
were
greatly
interested
in
these
proceedings
each
carcass
on
being
raised
to
the
surface
was
carefully
inspected
they
were
piled
up
in
two
heaps
and
would
provide
food
enough
for
the
dogs
for
the
whole
winter
meanwhile
the
other
party
were
at
work
under
hassel
direction
on
a
petroleum
cellar
the
barrels
which
had
been
laid
up
at
the
beginning
of
february
were
now
deep
below
the
snow
they
now
dug
down
at
both
ends
of
the
store
and
made
a
passage
below
the
surface
along
the
barrels
at
the
same
time
they
dug
far
enough
into
the
barrier
to
give
the
requisite
height
for
the
barrels
when
the
snow
had
been
thrown
out
one
hole
was
walled
up
again
while
a
large
entrance
was
constructed
over
the
other
stubberud
knowledge
of
vaulting
came
in
useful
here
and
he
has
the
credit
of
having
built
the
splendid
arched
entrance
to
the
it
was
a
pleasure
to
go
down
into
it
probably
no
one
has
had
so
fine
a
storehouse
for
petroleum
before
but
hassel
did
not
stop
here
he
had
the
building
fever
on
him
in
earnest
his
great
project
of
connecting
the
coal
and
wood
store
with
the
house
below
the
surface
nearly
took
my
breath
away
it
seemed
to
me
an
almost
superhuman
labour
but
they
did
it
the
distance
from
the
to
the
house
was
about
ten
yards
here
hassel
and
stubberud
laid
out
their
line
so
that
it
would
strike
the
passage
round
the
house
at
the
angle
when
they
had
done
this
they
dug
a
gigantic
hole
down
into
the
barrier
between
the
tent
and
the
house
and
then
dug
in
both
directions
from
here
and
soon
finished
the
work
but
now
prestrud
had
an
idea
while
the
hole
remained
open
he
wished
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
arranging
an
observatory
for
his
pendulum
apparatus
and
he
made
a
very
good
one
he
did
it
by
digging
at
right
angles
to
the
passage
and
had
his
little
observatory
between
the
and
the
house
when
all
the
snow
was
cleared
out
the
big
hole
was
covered
over
again
and
now
we
could
go
from
the
kitchen
direct
to
the
without
going
out
first
we
followed
the
passage
round
the
house
you
remember
where
all
the
tinned
provisions
stood
in
such
perfect
order
then
on
reaching
the
angle
of
the
house
this
new
passage
opened
out
and
led
across
to
the
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
on
the
side
a
door
led
into
the
pendulum
observatory
continuing
along
the
passage
one
came
first
to
some
steps
leading
down
and
then
the
passage
ended
in
a
steep
flight
of
steps
which
led
up
through
a
hole
in
the
snow
surface
on
going
up
this
one
suddenly
found
oneself
in
the
middle
of
the
it
was
a
fine
piece
of
work
and
did
all
honour
to
its
designers
it
paid
too
hassel
could
now
fetch
coal
at
any
time
under
cover
and
escaped
having
to
go
out
of
doors
but
this
was
not
the
end
of
our
great
underground
works
we
wanted
a
room
where
wisting
could
store
all
the
things
in
his
charge
he
was
specially
anxious
about
the
clothing
and
wished
to
have
it
under
a
roof
we
therefore
decided
upon
a
room
sufficiently
large
to
house
all
these
articles
and
at
the
same
time
to
provide
for
wisting
and
hanssen
who
would
have
to
lash
all
the
sledges
as
fast
as
they
came
from
bjaaland
wisting
elected
to
build
this
room
in
a
big
that
had
formed
around
the
tent
in
which
he
had
kept
all
his
stuff
the
spot
lay
to
the
of
the
house
the
clothing
store
as
this
building
was
called
was
fairly
large
and
provided
space
not
only
for
all
our
equipment
but
also
for
a
workshop
from
it
a
door
led
into
a
very
small
room
where
wisting
set
up
his
and
worked
on
it
all
through
the
winter
continuing
in
a
direction
we
came
to
another
big
room
called
the
crystal
palace
in
which
all
the
ski
and
sledging
cases
were
stored
here
all
the
provisions
for
the
sledge
journey
were
packed
for
the
time
being
this
room
remained
separate
from
the
others
and
we
had
to
go
out
of
doors
to
reach
it
later
when
lindstrom
had
dug
out
an
enormous
hole
in
the
barrier
at
the
spot
where
he
took
all
the
snow
and
ice
for
cooking
we
connected
this
with
the
two
rooms
last
mentioned
and
were
thus
finally
able
to
go
everywhere
under
the
snow
the
astronomical
observatory
had
also
arisen
it
lay
right
alongside
the
crystal
palace
but
it
had
an
air
of
suffering
from
debility
and
before
very
long
it
passed
peacefully
away
prestrud
afterwards
invented
many
patents
he
used
an
empty
barrel
for
a
time
as
a
pedestal
then
an
old
block
of
wood
his
experience
of
is
manifold
all
these
undertakings
were
finished
at
the
beginning
of
may
one
last
piece
of
work
remained
and
then
at
last
we
should
be
ready
this
was
the
rebuilding
of
the
depot
the
small
heaps
in
which
the
cases
were
piled
proved
unsatisfactory
as
the
passages
between
the
different
piles
offered
a
fine
site
for
all
the
cases
were
now
taken
out
and
laid
in
two
long
rows
with
sufficient
intervals
between
them
to
prevent
their
offering
resistance
to
the
drifting
snow
this
work
was
carried
out
in
two
days
the
days
were
now
fairly
short
and
we
were
ready
to
take
up
our
indoor
work
the
winter
duties
were
assigned
as
follows
prestrud
scientific
observations
johansen
packing
of
sledging
provisions
hassel
had
to
keep
lindstrom
supplied
with
coal
wood
and
paraffin
and
to
make
an
occupation
he
was
very
familiar
with
from
the
second
expedition
stubberud
was
to
reduce
the
weight
of
the
sledge
cases
to
a
minimum
besides
doing
a
lot
of
other
things
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
turn
his
hand
to
so
the
programme
of
his
winter
work
was
left
rather
vague
i
knew
he
would
manage
a
great
deal
more
than
the
sledge
cases
though
it
must
be
said
that
it
was
a
tiresome
job
he
had
bjaaland
was
allotted
the
task
which
we
all
regarded
with
intense
interest
the
alteration
of
the
sledges
we
knew
that
an
enormous
amount
of
weight
could
be
saved
but
how
much
hanssen
and
wisting
had
to
lash
together
the
different
parts
as
they
were
finished
this
was
to
be
done
in
the
clothing
store
these
two
had
also
a
number
of
other
things
on
their
programme
for
the
winter
there
are
many
who
think
that
a
polar
expedition
is
synonymous
with
idleness
i
wish
i
had
had
a
few
adherents
of
this
belief
at
framheim
that
winter
they
would
have
gone
away
with
a
different
opinion
not
that
the
hours
of
work
were
excessively
long
the
circumstances
forbade
that
but
during
those
hours
the
work
was
brisk
on
several
previous
sledge
journeys
i
had
made
the
experience
that
thermometers
are
very
fragile
things
it
often
happens
that
at
the
beginning
of
a
journey
one
breaks
all
one
thermometers
and
is
left
without
any
means
of
determining
the
temperature
if
in
such
circumstances
one
had
accustomed
oneself
to
guess
the
temperature
it
would
have
given
the
mean
temperature
for
the
month
with
a
fair
degree
of
accuracy
the
guesses
for
single
days
might
vary
somewhat
from
reality
on
one
side
or
the
other
but
as
i
say
one
would
arrive
at
a
fair
estimate
of
the
mean
temperature
with
this
in
my
mind
i
started
a
guessing
competition
as
each
man
came
in
in
the
morning
he
gave
his
opinion
of
the
temperature
of
the
day
and
this
was
entered
in
a
book
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
figures
were
gone
through
and
the
one
who
had
guessed
correctly
the
greatest
number
of
times
won
the
prize
a
few
cigars
besides
giving
practice
in
guessing
the
temperature
it
was
a
very
good
diversion
to
begin
the
day
with
when
one
day
is
almost
exactly
like
another
as
it
was
with
us
the
first
hour
of
the
morning
is
often
apt
to
be
a
little
sour
especially
before
one
has
had
one
cup
of
coffee
i
may
say
at
once
that
this
morning
grumpiness
very
seldom
showed
itself
with
us
but
one
never
knows
one
can
not
always
be
sure
the
most
amiable
man
may
often
give
one
a
surprise
before
the
coffee
has
had
its
effect
in
this
respect
the
guessing
was
an
excellent
thing
it
took
up
everyone
attention
and
diverted
the
critical
moments
each
man
entrance
was
awaited
with
excitement
and
one
man
was
not
allowed
to
make
his
guess
in
the
hearing
of
the
next
that
would
undoubtedly
have
exercised
an
influence
therefore
they
had
to
speak
as
they
came
in
one
by
one
now
stubberud
what
the
temperature
stubberud
had
his
own
way
of
calculating
which
i
never
succeeded
in
getting
at
one
day
for
instance
he
looked
about
him
and
studied
the
various
faces
it
is
warm
he
said
at
last
with
a
great
deal
of
conviction
i
could
immediately
console
him
with
the
assurance
that
he
had
guessed
right
it
was
the
monthly
results
were
very
interesting
so
far
as
i
remember
the
best
performance
the
competition
could
show
in
any
month
was
eight
approximately
correct
guesses
a
man
might
keep
remarkably
close
to
the
actual
temperature
for
a
long
time
and
then
suddenly
one
day
make
an
error
of
it
proved
that
the
winner
mean
temperature
agreed
within
a
few
tenths
of
a
degree
with
the
actual
mean
temperature
of
the
month
and
if
one
took
the
mean
of
all
the
competitors
mean
temperatures
it
gave
a
result
which
practically
speaking
agreed
with
the
reality
it
was
especially
with
this
object
in
view
that
this
guessing
was
instituted
if
later
on
we
should
be
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
all
our
thermometers
we
should
not
be
entirely
at
a
loss
it
may
be
convenient
to
mention
here
that
on
the
southern
sledge
journey
we
had
four
thermometers
with
us
observations
were
taken
three
times
daily
and
all
four
were
brought
home
in
undamaged
condition
wisting
had
charge
of
this
scientific
branch
and
i
think
the
feat
he
achieved
in
not
breaking
any
thermometers
is
unparalleled
chapter
viii
a
day
at
framheim
in
order
to
understand
our
daily
life
better
we
will
now
make
a
tour
of
framheim
it
is
june
early
in
the
morning
perfect
stillness
lies
over
the
barrier
such
stillness
as
no
one
who
has
not
been
in
these
regions
has
any
idea
of
we
come
up
the
old
sledge
road
from
the
place
where
the
fram
used
to
lie
you
will
stop
several
times
on
the
way
and
ask
whether
this
can
be
real
anything
so
inconceivably
beautiful
has
never
yet
been
seen
there
lies
the
northern
edge
of
the
fram
barrier
with
mounts
nelson
and
ronniken
nearest
behind
them
ridge
after
ridge
peak
after
peak
the
venerable
pressure
masses
rise
one
higher
than
another
the
light
is
so
wonderful
what
causes
this
strange
glow
it
is
clear
as
daylight
and
yet
the
shortest
day
of
the
year
is
at
hand
there
are
no
shadows
so
it
can
not
be
the
moon
no
it
is
one
of
the
few
really
intense
appearances
of
the
aurora
australis
that
receives
us
now
it
looks
as
though
nature
wished
to
honour
our
guests
and
to
show
herself
in
her
best
attire
and
it
is
a
gorgeous
dress
she
has
chosen
perfectly
calm
clear
with
a
starry
sparkle
and
not
a
sound
in
any
direction
but
wait
what
is
that
like
a
stream
of
fire
the
light
shoots
across
the
sky
and
a
whistling
sound
follows
the
movement
hush
ca
you
hear
it
shoots
forward
again
takes
the
form
of
a
band
and
glows
in
rays
of
red
and
green
it
stands
still
for
a
moment
thinking
of
what
direction
it
shall
take
and
then
away
again
followed
by
an
intermittent
whistling
sound
so
nature
has
offered
us
on
this
wonderful
morning
one
of
her
most
mysterious
most
incomprehensible
phenomena
the
audible
southern
light
now
you
will
be
able
to
go
home
and
tell
your
friends
that
you
have
personally
seen
and
heard
the
southern
lights
for
i
suppose
you
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
really
done
so
doubt
how
can
one
be
in
doubt
about
what
one
has
heard
with
one
own
ears
and
seen
with
own
eyes
and
yet
you
have
been
deceived
like
so
many
others
the
whistling
northern
and
southern
lights
have
never
existed
they
are
only
a
creation
of
your
own
yearning
for
the
mystical
accompanied
by
your
own
breath
which
freezes
in
the
cold
air
goodbye
beautiful
dream
it
vanishes
from
the
glorious
landscape
perhaps
it
was
stupid
of
me
to
call
attention
to
that
my
guests
have
now
lost
much
of
the
beautiful
mystery
and
the
landscape
no
longer
has
the
same
attraction
meanwhile
we
have
come
up
past
nelson
and
ronniken
and
are
just
climbing
the
first
ridge
not
far
away
a
big
tent
rises
before
us
and
in
front
of
it
we
see
two
long
dark
lines
it
is
our
main
depot
that
we
are
coming
to
and
you
can
see
that
we
keep
our
things
in
good
order
case
upon
case
as
if
they
had
been
placed
in
position
by
an
expert
builder
and
they
all
point
the
same
way
all
the
numbers
face
the
north
what
made
you
choose
that
particular
direction
is
the
natural
question
had
you
any
special
object
oh
yes
we
had
if
you
will
look
towards
the
east
you
will
notice
that
on
the
horizon
the
sky
has
a
rather
lighter
brighter
colour
there
than
in
any
other
part
that
is
the
day
as
we
see
it
now
at
present
we
can
not
see
to
do
anything
by
its
light
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
see
that
these
cases
were
lying
with
their
numbers
to
the
north
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
brilliant
aurora
australis
but
that
light
colour
will
rise
and
grow
stronger
at
nine
it
will
be
in
the
and
we
shall
be
able
to
trace
it
ten
degrees
above
the
horizon
you
would
not
then
think
it
gave
so
much
light
as
it
really
does
but
you
would
be
able
without
an
effort
to
read
the
numbers
what
is
more
you
would
be
able
to
read
the
makers
names
which
are
marked
on
several
of
the
cases
and
when
the
flush
of
daylight
has
moved
to
the
north
you
will
be
able
to
see
them
even
more
clearly
no
doubt
these
figures
and
letters
are
big
about
inches
high
and
inches
broad
but
it
shows
nevertheless
that
we
have
daylight
here
at
the
darkest
time
of
the
year
so
there
is
not
the
absolute
darkness
that
people
think
the
tent
that
stands
behind
there
contains
dried
fish
we
have
a
great
deal
of
that
commodity
and
our
dogs
can
never
suffer
hunger
but
now
we
must
hurry
on
if
we
are
to
see
how
the
day
begins
at
framheim
what
we
are
passing
now
is
the
we
have
five
of
them
standing
between
the
camp
and
the
depot
they
are
useful
on
dark
days
when
the
east
wind
is
blowing
and
the
snow
falling
and
there
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
you
see
framheim
at
present
it
looks
like
a
dark
shadow
on
the
snow
although
it
is
not
far
away
the
sharp
peaks
you
see
pointing
to
the
sky
are
all
our
dog
tents
the
but
itself
you
can
not
see
it
is
completely
snowed
under
and
hidden
in
the
barrier
but
i
see
you
are
getting
warm
with
walking
we
will
go
a
little
more
slowly
so
that
you
wo
perspire
too
much
it
is
not
more
than
so
you
have
every
reason
to
be
warm
walking
with
that
temperature
and
calm
weather
like
one
soon
feels
warm
if
one
moves
about
a
little
the
flat
place
we
have
now
come
down
into
is
a
sort
of
basin
if
you
bend
down
and
look
round
the
horizon
you
will
be
able
with
an
effort
to
follow
the
ridges
and
hummocks
the
whole
way
round
our
house
lies
on
the
slope
we
are
now
approaching
we
chose
that
particular
spot
as
we
thought
it
would
offer
the
best
protection
and
it
turned
out
that
we
were
right
the
wind
we
have
had
has
nearly
always
come
from
the
east
when
there
was
any
strength
in
it
and
against
such
winds
the
slope
provides
an
excellent
shelter
if
we
had
placed
our
house
over
there
where
the
depot
stands
we
should
have
felt
the
weather
much
more
severely
but
now
you
must
be
careful
when
we
come
near
to
the
house
so
that
the
dogs
do
hear
us
we
have
now
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
of
them
and
if
they
once
start
making
a
noise
then
to
the
peaceful
polar
morning
now
we
are
there
and
in
such
daylight
as
there
is
you
can
see
the
immediate
surroundings
you
ca
see
the
house
you
say
no
i
can
quite
believe
it
that
chimney
sticking
out
of
the
snow
is
all
there
is
left
above
the
barrier
this
we
are
coming
to
you
might
take
for
a
loose
piece
of
boarding
thrown
out
on
the
snow
but
that
is
not
the
case
it
is
the
way
down
into
our
home
you
must
stoop
a
bit
when
you
go
down
into
the
barrier
everything
is
on
a
reduced
scale
here
in
the
polar
regions
we
ca
afford
to
be
extravagant
now
you
have
four
steps
down
take
care
they
are
rather
high
luckily
we
have
come
in
time
to
see
the
day
started
i
see
the
is
not
yet
lighted
so
lindstrom
has
not
turned
out
take
hold
of
the
tail
of
my
anorak
and
follow
me
this
is
a
passage
in
the
snow
that
we
are
in
leading
to
the
oh
i
so
sorry
you
must
forgive
me
did
you
hurt
yourself
i
quite
forgot
to
tell
you
to
look
out
for
the
threshold
of
the
door
it
is
not
the
first
time
someone
has
fallen
over
it
that
a
trap
we
have
all
fallen
into
but
now
we
know
it
and
it
does
catch
us
any
more
if
you
will
wait
a
second
i
strike
a
match
and
then
we
shall
see
our
way
here
we
are
in
the
kitchen
now
make
yourself
invisible
and
follow
me
all
day
and
you
will
see
what
our
life
is
like
as
you
know
it
is
john
eve
so
we
shall
only
work
during
the
forenoon
but
you
will
be
able
to
see
how
we
spend
a
holiday
evening
when
you
send
your
account
home
you
must
promise
me
not
to
paint
it
in
too
strong
colours
for
the
present
there
the
i
wait
and
wait
and
wait
at
home
i
am
always
accustomed
to
hear
that
noise
followed
by
the
passage
of
a
pair
of
bare
feet
across
the
floor
and
a
yawn
or
so
here
not
a
sound
when
amundsen
left
me
he
forgot
to
say
where
i
could
best
put
myself
i
tried
to
follow
him
into
the
room
but
the
atmosphere
there
no
thanks
i
could
easily
guess
that
nine
men
were
sleeping
in
a
room
feet
by
feet
it
did
not
require
anyone
to
tell
me
that
still
not
a
sound
i
suppose
they
only
keep
that
to
make
themselves
imagine
they
are
turning
out
wait
a
minute
though
lindtrom
lindtrom
he
went
by
the
name
of
lindtrom
not
lindstrom
now
by
jove
you
got
to
get
up
the
clock
made
row
enough
that
wisting
i
know
his
voice
i
know
him
at
home
he
was
always
an
early
bird
a
frightful
crash
that
lindstrom
slipping
out
of
his
bunk
but
if
he
was
late
in
turning
out
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
get
into
his
clothes
one
two
three
and
there
he
stood
in
the
doorway
with
a
little
lamp
in
his
hand
it
was
now
six
he
looked
well
round
and
fat
as
when
i
saw
him
last
he
is
in
dark
blue
clothes
with
a
knitted
helmet
over
his
head
i
should
like
to
know
why
it
is
certainly
not
cold
in
here
for
that
matter
i
have
often
felt
it
colder
in
kitchens
at
home
in
the
winter
so
that
can
not
be
the
reason
oh
i
have
it
he
is
bald
and
does
like
to
show
it
that
is
often
the
way
with
bald
men
they
hate
anyone
seeing
it
the
first
thing
he
does
is
to
lay
the
fire
the
range
is
under
the
window
and
takes
up
half
the
feet
by
feet
kitchen
his
method
of
laying
a
fire
is
the
first
thing
that
attracts
my
attention
at
home
we
generally
begin
by
splitting
sticks
and
laying
the
wood
in
very
carefully
but
lindstrom
just
shoves
the
wood
in
anyhow
all
over
the
place
well
if
he
can
make
that
barn
he
clever
i
am
still
wondering
how
he
will
manage
it
when
he
suddenly
stoops
down
and
picks
up
a
can
without
the
slightest
hesitation
as
though
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
pours
paraffin
over
the
wood
not
one
or
two
drops
oh
no
he
throws
on
enough
to
make
sure
a
match
and
then
i
understood
how
lindstrom
got
it
to
light
it
was
smartly
done
i
must
say
but
hassel
ought
to
have
seen
it
amundsen
had
told
me
something
of
their
arrangements
on
the
way
up
and
i
knew
hassel
was
responsible
for
coal
wood
and
oil
the
had
been
filled
the
evening
before
and
he
had
only
to
push
it
to
one
side
to
make
room
for
the
kettle
and
this
did
not
take
long
to
boil
with
the
heat
he
had
set
going
the
fire
burned
up
so
that
it
roared
in
the
chimney
this
fellow
is
not
short
of
fuel
strange
what
a
hurry
he
is
in
to
get
that
coffee
ready
i
thought
breakfast
was
at
eight
and
it
is
now
not
more
than
a
quarter
past
six
he
grinds
the
coffee
till
his
cheeks
shake
to
and
fro
incessantly
if
the
quality
is
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
it
must
be
good
enough
devil
take
it
lindstrom
morning
greeting
this
is
not
worth
throwing
to
the
pigs
might
just
as
well
chew
the
beans
it
take
so
long
and
he
is
right
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
hard
work
he
has
only
ground
just
enough
now
it
is
six
on
with
the
coffee
ah
what
a
perfume
i
would
give
something
to
know
where
amundsen
got
it
from
meanwhile
the
cook
has
taken
out
his
pipe
and
is
smoking
away
gaily
on
an
empty
stomach
it
does
not
seem
to
do
him
any
harm
hullo
there
the
coffee
boiling
over
while
the
coffee
was
boiling
and
lindstrom
smoked
i
was
still
wondering
why
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
the
coffee
ready
you
ass
i
thought
ca
you
see
of
course
he
is
going
to
give
himself
a
drink
of
fresh
hot
coffee
before
the
others
are
up
that
clear
enough
when
the
coffee
was
ready
i
sat
down
on
a
that
stood
in
a
corner
and
watched
him
but
i
must
say
he
surprised
me
again
he
pushed
the
away
from
the
fire
and
took
down
a
cup
from
the
wall
then
went
to
a
jug
that
stood
on
the
bench
and
poured
out
would
you
believe
it
a
cup
of
cold
tea
if
he
goes
on
in
this
way
we
shall
have
surprises
enough
before
evening
i
thought
to
myself
then
he
began
to
be
deeply
interested
in
an
enamelled
iron
bowl
which
stood
on
a
shelf
above
the
range
the
heat
which
was
now
intense
i
looked
at
the
thermograph
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
it
registered
did
not
seem
to
be
sufficient
for
its
mysterious
contents
it
was
also
wrapped
up
in
towels
and
cloths
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
having
caught
a
severe
cold
the
glances
he
threw
into
it
from
time
to
time
were
anxious
he
looked
at
the
clock
and
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
then
suddenly
i
saw
his
face
brighten
he
gave
a
long
not
very
melodious
whistle
bent
down
seized
a
and
hurried
out
into
the
now
i
was
really
excited
what
was
coming
next
he
came
back
at
once
with
a
happy
smile
all
over
his
face
and
the
full
of
coal
if
i
had
been
curious
before
i
was
now
anxious
i
withdrew
as
far
as
possible
from
the
range
sat
down
on
the
floor
itself
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
thermograph
as
i
thought
the
pen
began
to
move
upward
with
rapid
steps
this
was
too
bad
i
made
up
my
mind
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
meteorological
institute
as
soon
as
i
got
home
and
tell
them
what
i
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
but
now
the
heat
seemed
intolerable
down
on
the
floor
where
i
was
sitting
what
must
it
be
like
heavens
above
the
man
was
sitting
on
the
stove
he
must
have
gone
out
of
his
mind
i
was
just
going
to
give
a
cry
of
terror
when
the
door
opened
and
in
came
amundsen
from
the
room
i
gave
a
deep
sigh
now
it
would
be
all
right
the
time
was
ten
minutes
past
seven
fatty
what
it
like
outside
easterly
breeze
and
thick
when
i
was
out
but
that
a
good
while
ago
this
fairly
took
my
breath
away
he
stood
there
with
the
coolest
air
in
the
world
and
talked
about
the
weather
and
i
could
take
my
oath
he
had
not
been
outside
the
door
that
morning
how
it
getting
on
is
it
coming
amundsen
looks
with
interest
at
the
mysterious
bowl
lindstrom
takes
another
peep
under
the
cloth
yes
it
coming
at
last
but
i
had
to
give
it
a
lot
yes
it
feels
like
it
answers
the
other
and
goes
out
my
interest
is
now
divided
between
it
in
the
bowl
and
amundsen
return
with
the
meteorological
discussion
that
will
ensue
it
is
not
long
before
he
reappears
evidently
the
temperature
outside
is
not
inviting
let
hear
again
my
friend
he
seats
himself
on
the
beside
which
i
am
sitting
on
the
floor
what
kind
of
weather
did
you
say
it
was
i
prick
up
my
ears
there
is
going
to
be
fun
it
was
an
easterly
breeze
and
thick
as
a
wall
when
i
was
out
at
six
hm
then
it
has
cleared
remarkably
quickly
it
a
dead
calm
now
and
quite
clear
ah
that
just
what
i
should
have
thought
i
could
see
it
was
falling
light
and
it
was
getting
brighter
in
the
east
he
got
out
of
that
well
meanwhile
it
was
again
the
turn
of
the
bowl
it
was
taken
down
from
the
shelf
over
the
range
and
put
on
the
bench
the
various
cloths
were
removed
one
by
one
until
it
was
left
perfectly
bare
i
could
not
resist
any
longer
i
had
to
get
up
and
look
and
indeed
it
was
worth
looking
at
the
bowl
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
dough
full
of
and
showing
every
sign
that
he
had
got
it
to
rise
now
i
began
to
respect
lindstrom
he
was
a
devil
of
a
fellow
no
confectioner
in
our
native
latitudes
could
have
shown
a
finer
dough
it
was
now
everything
seems
to
go
by
the
clock
here
lindstrom
threw
a
last
tender
glance
at
his
bowl
picked
up
a
little
bottle
of
spirit
and
went
into
the
next
room
i
saw
my
chance
of
following
him
in
there
was
not
going
to
be
any
fun
out
there
with
amundsen
who
was
sitting
on
the
half
asleep
in
the
other
room
it
was
and
an
atmosphere
no
ten
atmospheres
at
least
i
stood
still
in
the
doorway
and
breathed
heavily
lindstrom
stumbled
forward
in
the
darkness
felt
for
and
found
the
matches
he
struck
one
and
lighted
a
that
hung
beneath
a
hanging
lamp
there
was
not
much
to
be
seen
by
the
light
of
the
spirit
flame
one
could
still
only
guess
hear
too
perhaps
they
were
sound
sleepers
those
boys
one
grunted
here
and
another
there
they
were
snoring
in
every
corner
the
spirit
might
have
been
burning
for
a
couple
of
minutes
when
lindstrom
had
to
set
to
work
in
a
hurry
he
was
off
just
as
the
flame
went
out
leaving
the
room
in
black
darkness
i
heard
the
spirit
bottle
and
the
nearest
stool
upset
and
what
followed
i
do
know
as
i
was
unfamiliar
with
the
surroundings
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
i
heard
a
click
had
no
idea
what
it
was
and
then
the
same
movement
back
again
to
the
lamp
of
course
he
now
fell
over
the
stool
he
had
upset
before
meanwhile
there
was
a
hissing
sound
and
a
stifling
smell
of
paraffin
i
was
thinking
of
making
my
escape
through
the
door
when
suddenly
just
as
i
suppose
it
happened
on
the
first
day
of
creation
in
an
instant
there
was
light
but
it
was
a
light
that
defies
description
it
dazzled
and
hurt
the
eyes
it
was
so
bright
it
was
perfectly
white
and
extremely
agreeable
when
one
was
not
looking
at
it
evidently
it
was
one
of
the
lux
lamps
my
admiration
for
lindstrom
had
now
risen
to
enthusiasm
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
be
able
to
make
myself
visible
embrace
him
and
tell
him
what
i
thought
of
him
but
that
could
not
be
i
should
not
then
be
able
to
see
life
at
framheim
as
it
really
was
so
i
stood
still
lindstrom
first
tried
to
put
straight
what
he
had
upset
in
his
struggle
with
the
lamp
the
spirit
had
of
course
run
out
of
the
bottle
when
it
fell
and
was
now
flowing
all
over
the
table
this
did
not
seem
to
make
the
slightest
impression
on
him
a
little
scoop
with
his
hand
and
it
all
landed
on
clothes
which
were
lying
close
by
this
fellow
seemed
to
be
as
well
off
for
spirit
as
for
paraffin
then
he
vanished
into
the
kitchen
but
reappeared
immediately
with
plates
cups
knives
and
forks
laying
of
the
was
the
finest
clattering
performance
i
have
ever
heard
if
he
wanted
to
put
a
spoon
into
a
cup
he
did
not
do
it
in
the
ordinary
way
no
he
put
down
the
cup
lifted
the
spoon
high
in
the
air
and
then
dropped
it
into
the
cup
the
noise
he
made
in
this
way
was
infernal
now
i
began
to
see
why
amundsen
had
got
up
so
early
he
wanted
to
escape
this
process
of
laying
the
table
i
expect
but
this
gave
me
at
once
an
insight
into
the
of
the
gentlemen
in
bed
if
this
had
happened
anywhere
else
lindstrom
would
have
had
a
boot
at
his
head
but
here
they
must
have
been
the
most
peaceable
men
in
the
world
meanwhile
i
had
had
time
to
look
around
me
close
to
the
door
where
i
was
standing
a
pipe
came
down
to
the
floor
it
struck
me
at
once
that
this
was
a
i
bent
down
and
put
my
hand
over
the
opening
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
hint
of
air
to
be
felt
so
this
was
the
cause
of
the
bad
atmosphere
the
next
things
that
caught
my
eye
were
the
bunks
nine
of
them
three
on
the
right
hand
and
six
on
the
left
most
of
the
sleepers
if
they
could
be
regarded
as
such
while
the
table
was
being
laid
slept
in
bags
they
must
have
been
warm
enough
the
rest
of
the
space
was
taken
up
by
a
long
table
with
small
stools
on
two
sides
of
it
order
appeared
to
reign
most
of
the
clothes
were
hung
up
of
course
a
few
lay
on
the
floor
but
then
lindstrom
had
been
running
about
in
the
dark
and
perhaps
he
had
pulled
them
down
on
the
table
by
the
window
stood
a
gramophone
and
some
and
the
furniture
was
not
plentiful
nor
was
it
in
the
style
of
louis
quinze
or
louis
seize
but
it
was
sufficient
on
the
wall
with
the
window
hung
a
few
paintings
and
on
the
other
portraits
of
the
king
queen
and
crown
prince
olav
apparently
cut
out
of
an
illustrated
paper
and
pasted
on
blue
cardboard
in
the
corner
nearest
the
door
on
the
right
where
there
was
no
bunk
the
space
seem
to
be
occupied
by
clothes
some
hanging
on
the
wall
some
on
lines
stretched
across
so
that
was
the
modest
in
its
simplicity
under
the
table
were
some
varnished
boxes
heaven
knows
what
they
were
for
now
there
seemed
to
be
life
in
one
of
the
bunks
it
was
wisting
who
was
getting
tired
of
the
noise
that
still
continued
lindstrom
took
his
time
rattling
the
spoons
smiling
maliciously
to
himself
and
looking
up
at
the
bunks
he
did
not
make
all
this
racket
for
nothing
wisting
then
was
the
first
to
respond
and
apparently
the
only
one
at
any
rate
there
was
not
a
sign
of
movement
in
any
of
the
others
fatty
thought
you
were
going
to
stop
there
till
dinner
this
is
lindstrom
greeting
look
after
yourself
old
if
i
had
got
you
out
you
have
been
asleep
still
that
was
paying
him
in
his
own
coin
wisting
was
evidently
not
to
be
trifled
with
however
they
smiled
and
nodded
to
each
other
in
a
way
that
showed
that
there
was
no
harm
meant
at
last
lindstrom
had
got
rid
of
the
last
cup
and
brought
down
the
curtain
on
that
act
with
the
dropping
of
the
final
spoon
i
thought
now
that
he
would
go
back
to
his
work
in
the
kitchen
but
it
looked
as
if
he
had
something
else
to
do
first
he
straightened
himself
thrust
his
chin
in
the
air
and
put
his
head
back
reminding
me
very
forcibly
of
a
young
cockerel
preparing
to
crow
and
roared
with
the
full
force
of
his
lungs
turn
out
boys
and
look
sharp
now
he
had
finished
his
morning
duty
there
the
seemed
suddenly
to
awake
to
life
and
such
remarks
as
that
a
devil
of
a
fellow
or
shut
up
you
old
chatterbox
showed
that
the
inhabitants
of
framheim
were
now
awake
beaming
with
joy
the
cause
of
the
trouble
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
and
now
one
after
the
other
they
stick
their
heads
out
followed
by
the
rest
of
them
that
must
be
helmer
hanssen
who
was
on
the
gjoa
he
looks
as
if
he
could
handle
a
rope
ah
and
there
we
have
olav
olavson
bjaaland
i
could
have
cried
aloud
for
joy
my
old
friend
from
holmenkollen
the
great
runner
you
remember
and
he
managed
the
jump
too
metres
i
think
standing
if
amundsen
has
a
few
like
him
he
will
get
to
the
pole
all
right
and
there
comes
stubberud
the
man
the
aftenpost
said
was
so
clever
at
as
i
see
him
now
he
does
not
give
me
the
impression
of
being
a
but
one
ca
tell
and
here
come
hassel
johansen
and
prestrud
now
they
are
all
up
and
will
soon
begin
the
day
work
stubberud
it
is
lindstrom
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
if
you
want
any
hot
cakes
you
must
get
some
air
down
stubberud
merely
smiles
he
looks
as
if
he
felt
sure
of
getting
them
all
the
same
what
was
it
he
talked
about
hot
cakes
they
must
be
connected
with
the
beautiful
dough
and
the
delicate
seductive
smell
of
cooking
that
is
now
penetrating
through
the
crack
of
the
door
stubberud
is
going
and
i
must
go
with
him
yes
as
i
thought
there
stands
lindstrom
in
all
his
glory
before
the
range
brandishing
the
weapon
with
which
he
turns
the
cakes
and
in
a
pan
lie
three
buckwheat
cakes
quivering
with
the
heat
of
the
fire
heavens
how
hungry
it
made
me
i
take
up
my
old
position
so
as
not
to
be
in
way
and
watch
lindstrom
he
the
man
he
produces
hot
cakes
with
astonishing
dexterity
it
almost
reminds
one
of
a
juggler
throwing
up
balls
so
rapid
and
regular
is
the
process
the
way
he
manipulates
the
shows
a
fabulous
proficiency
with
the
skimmer
in
one
hand
he
dumps
fresh
dough
into
the
pan
and
with
the
in
the
other
he
removes
those
that
are
done
all
at
the
same
time
it
seems
almost
more
than
human
there
comes
wisting
salutes
and
holds
out
a
little
tin
mug
flattered
by
the
honour
the
cook
fills
his
mug
with
boiling
water
and
he
disappears
into
the
but
this
interruption
puts
lindstrom
off
his
jugglery
with
the
hot
of
them
rolls
down
on
to
the
floor
this
fellow
is
extraordinarily
phlegmatic
i
ca
make
out
whether
he
missed
that
cake
or
not
i
believe
the
sigh
that
escaped
him
at
the
same
instant
meant
something
like
well
we
must
leave
some
for
the
dogs
and
now
they
all
come
in
single
file
with
their
little
mugs
and
get
each
a
drop
of
boiling
water
i
get
up
interested
in
this
proceeding
and
slip
out
with
one
of
them
into
the
and
so
on
to
the
barrier
you
will
hardly
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
what
i
saw
all
the
polar
explorers
standing
in
a
row
brushing
their
teeth
what
do
you
say
to
that
so
they
are
not
such
absolute
pigs
after
all
there
was
a
scent
of
stomatol
everywhere
here
comes
amundsen
he
has
evidently
been
out
taking
the
meteorological
observations
as
he
holds
the
anemometer
in
one
hand
i
follow
him
through
the
passage
and
when
no
one
is
looking
take
the
opportunity
of
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
and
saying
a
grand
lot
of
boys
he
only
smiled
but
a
smile
may
often
say
more
than
many
words
i
understood
what
it
meant
he
had
known
that
a
long
while
and
a
good
deal
more
it
was
now
eight
the
door
from
the
kitchen
to
the
room
was
left
wide
open
and
the
warmth
streamed
in
and
mixed
with
the
fresh
air
that
stubberud
had
now
forced
to
come
down
the
right
way
now
it
was
pleasanter
inside
fresh
warm
air
everywhere
then
came
a
very
interesting
scene
as
the
gentlemen
returned
they
had
to
guess
the
temperature
one
by
one
this
gave
occasion
for
much
joking
and
fun
and
amid
laughter
and
chat
the
first
meal
of
the
day
was
taken
in
speeches
amid
toasts
and
enthusiasm
our
polar
explorers
are
often
compared
with
our
forefathers
the
bold
vikings
this
comparison
never
occurred
to
me
for
a
moment
when
i
saw
this
assemblage
of
ordinary
everyday
their
teeth
but
now
that
they
were
busy
with
the
dishes
i
was
bound
to
acknowledge
its
aptitude
for
our
forefathers
the
vikings
could
not
possibly
have
attacked
their
food
with
greater
energy
than
these
nine
men
did
one
pile
of
after
another
disappeared
as
if
they
had
been
made
of
air
and
i
in
my
simplicity
had
imagined
that
one
of
them
was
a
man
ration
spread
with
butter
and
surmounted
with
jam
these
cakes
slipped
down
with
fabulous
rapidity
with
a
smile
i
thought
of
the
conjurer
holding
an
egg
in
his
hand
one
minute
and
making
it
disappear
the
next
if
it
is
a
cook
best
reward
to
see
his
food
appreciated
then
indeed
lindstrom
had
good
wages
the
cakes
were
washed
down
with
big
bowls
of
strong
aromatic
coffee
one
could
soon
trace
the
effect
and
conversation
became
general
the
first
great
subject
was
a
novel
which
was
obviously
very
popular
and
was
called
the
rome
express
it
appeared
to
me
from
what
was
said
i
have
unfortunately
never
read
this
celebrated
work
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
this
train
and
a
lively
discussion
arose
as
to
who
had
committed
it
i
believe
the
general
verdict
was
one
of
suicide
i
have
always
supposed
that
subjects
of
conversation
must
be
very
difficult
to
find
on
expeditions
like
these
where
the
same
people
mix
day
after
day
for
years
but
there
was
certainly
no
sign
of
any
such
difficulty
here
no
sooner
had
the
express
vanished
in
the
distance
than
in
steamed
the
language
question
and
it
came
at
full
steam
too
it
was
clear
that
there
were
adherents
of
both
camps
present
for
fear
of
hurting
the
feelings
of
either
party
i
shall
abstain
from
setting
down
what
i
heard
but
i
may
say
as
much
as
this
that
the
party
of
reform
ended
by
declaring
the
maal
to
be
the
only
proper
speech
of
norway
while
their
opponents
maintained
the
same
of
their
language
after
a
while
pipes
came
out
and
the
scent
of
plug
soon
struggled
with
the
fresh
air
for
supremacy
over
the
tobacco
the
work
for
the
day
was
discussed
well
i
have
enough
to
do
supplying
that
woodswallower
over
the
holiday
said
hassel
i
gave
a
chuckle
if
hassel
had
known
of
the
way
the
paraffin
was
used
that
morning
he
would
have
added
something
about
the
i
expect
it
was
now
eight
and
stubberud
and
bjaaland
got
up
from
the
number
of
different
garments
they
took
out
and
put
on
i
guessed
they
were
going
out
without
saying
anything
they
trudged
out
meanwhile
the
others
continued
their
morning
smoke
and
some
even
began
to
read
but
by
about
nine
they
were
all
on
the
move
they
put
on
their
skin
clothing
and
made
ready
to
go
out
by
this
time
bjaaland
and
stubberud
had
returned
from
a
walk
as
i
understood
from
such
remarks
as
beastly
cold
sharp
snow
by
the
depot
and
the
like
prestrud
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
get
ready
to
go
out
he
went
to
an
open
space
underneath
the
farthest
bunk
where
there
was
a
box
he
raised
the
lid
of
this
and
three
chronometers
appeared
at
the
same
moment
three
of
the
men
produced
their
watches
and
a
comparison
was
made
and
entered
in
a
book
after
each
watch
had
been
compared
its
owner
went
outside
taking
his
watch
with
him
i
took
the
opportunity
of
slipping
out
with
the
last
man
prestrud
and
his
chronometers
were
too
serious
for
me
i
wanted
to
see
what
the
others
were
about
there
was
plenty
of
life
outside
dogs
howls
in
every
key
came
from
the
tents
some
of
those
who
had
left
the
house
before
us
were
out
of
sight
so
they
had
probably
gone
to
their
respective
tents
and
presently
one
could
see
by
the
lights
that
they
were
in
the
act
of
letting
their
dogs
loose
how
well
the
tents
looked
against
the
dark
sky
though
it
could
no
longer
be
called
dark
the
little
flush
of
dawn
had
spread
and
overpowered
the
glow
of
the
aurora
australis
which
had
greatly
decreased
since
i
last
saw
it
evidently
it
was
near
its
end
now
the
band
began
to
swarm
out
darting
like
rockets
from
the
tents
here
were
all
black
red
brown
white
and
a
mixture
of
all
of
them
what
surprised
me
was
that
they
were
all
so
small
but
otherwise
they
looked
splendid
plump
and
round
well
kept
and
groomed
bursting
with
life
they
instantly
collected
into
little
groups
of
from
two
to
five
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
these
groups
consisted
of
intimate
friends
they
absolutely
petted
each
other
in
each
of
these
clusters
there
was
one
in
particular
who
was
made
much
of
all
the
others
came
round
him
licked
him
fawned
upon
him
and
gave
him
every
sign
of
deference
they
all
run
about
without
a
sign
of
unfriendliness
their
chief
interest
seems
to
be
centred
in
two
large
black
mounds
that
are
visible
in
the
foreground
of
the
camp
what
they
are
i
am
unable
to
make
out
there
is
not
light
enough
for
that
but
i
am
probably
not
far
wrong
in
guessing
that
they
are
seals
they
are
rather
hard
eating
anyhow
for
i
can
hear
them
crunching
under
the
dogs
teeth
here
there
is
an
occasional
disturbance
of
the
peace
they
do
not
seem
to
agree
so
well
over
their
food
but
there
is
never
a
regular
battle
a
watchman
is
present
armed
with
a
stick
and
when
he
shows
himself
and
makes
his
voice
heard
they
soon
separate
they
appear
to
be
well
disciplined
what
appealed
to
me
most
was
the
youngsters
and
the
youngest
of
all
the
young
ones
to
judge
from
their
appearance
were
about
ten
months
old
they
were
perfect
in
every
way
one
could
see
they
had
been
well
cared
for
from
their
birth
their
coats
were
surprisingly
thick
much
more
so
than
those
of
the
older
dogs
they
were
remarkably
plucky
and
would
not
give
in
to
anyone
and
there
are
the
smallest
of
all
like
little
balls
of
wool
they
roll
themselves
in
the
snow
and
have
great
fun
i
am
astonished
that
they
can
stand
the
cold
as
they
do
i
should
never
have
thought
that
such
young
animals
could
live
through
the
winter
afterwards
i
was
told
that
they
not
only
bore
the
cold
well
but
were
far
more
hardy
than
the
older
ones
while
the
dogs
were
glad
to
go
into
their
tents
in
the
evening
the
little
ones
refused
to
do
so
they
preferred
to
sleep
outside
and
they
did
so
for
a
great
part
of
the
winter
now
all
the
men
have
finished
unchaining
their
dogs
and
with
their
lanterns
in
their
hands
they
move
in
various
directions
and
disappear
apparently
into
the
barrier
surface
there
will
be
many
interesting
things
to
see
here
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
can
understand
that
what
on
earth
became
of
all
these
people
there
we
have
amundsen
he
is
left
alone
and
appears
to
be
in
charge
of
the
dogs
i
go
up
to
him
and
make
myself
known
ah
i
glad
you
came
he
says
now
i
can
introduce
you
to
some
of
our
celebrities
to
begin
with
here
is
the
trio
fix
lasse
and
snuppesen
they
always
behave
like
this
when
i
am
out
could
not
think
of
leaving
me
in
peace
for
an
instant
fix
that
big
grey
one
that
looks
like
a
wolf
has
many
a
snap
on
his
conscience
his
first
exploit
was
on
flekkero
near
christiansand
where
all
the
dogs
were
kept
for
a
month
after
they
arrived
from
greenland
there
he
gave
lindstrom
a
nasty
bite
when
his
back
was
turned
what
do
you
think
of
a
bite
of
a
mouth
like
that
fix
is
now
tame
and
without
a
growl
allows
his
master
to
take
hold
of
his
upper
and
under
jaws
and
open
his
mouth
ye
gods
what
teeth
i
inwardly
rejoice
that
i
was
not
in
lindstrom
trousers
that
day
if
you
notice
he
continues
with
a
smile
you
will
see
that
lindstrom
still
sits
down
cautiously
i
myself
have
a
mark
on
my
left
calf
and
a
good
many
more
of
us
have
the
same
there
are
several
of
us
who
still
treat
him
with
respect
and
here
we
have
lassesen
that
his
pet
name
he
was
christened
lasse
almost
pure
black
as
you
see
i
believe
he
was
the
wildest
of
the
lot
when
they
came
on
board
i
had
him
fastened
up
on
the
bridge
with
my
other
dogs
beside
fix
those
two
were
friends
from
their
greenland
days
but
i
can
tell
you
that
when
i
had
to
pass
lasse
i
always
judged
the
distance
first
as
a
rule
he
just
stood
looking
down
at
the
deck
exactly
like
a
mad
bull
if
i
tried
to
make
overtures
he
move
stood
quite
still
but
i
could
see
how
he
drew
back
his
upper
lip
and
showed
a
row
of
teeth
with
which
i
had
no
desire
to
become
acquainted
a
fortnight
passed
in
this
way
then
at
last
the
upper
lip
sank
and
the
head
was
raised
a
little
as
though
he
wanted
to
see
who
it
was
that
brought
him
food
and
water
every
day
but
the
way
from
that
to
friendship
was
long
and
tortuous
in
the
time
that
followed
i
used
to
scratch
him
on
the
back
with
a
stick
at
first
he
jumped
round
seized
the
stick
and
crushed
it
between
his
teeth
i
thought
myself
lucky
that
it
was
not
my
hand
i
came
a
little
nearer
to
him
every
day
until
one
day
i
risked
my
hand
he
gave
me
an
ugly
look
but
did
nothing
and
then
came
the
beginning
of
our
friendship
day
by
day
we
became
better
friends
and
now
you
can
see
what
footing
we
are
on
the
third
is
snuppesen
a
dark
red
lady
she
is
their
sworn
friend
and
never
leaves
them
she
is
the
quickest
and
most
active
of
our
dogs
you
can
see
that
she
is
fond
of
me
she
is
generally
on
her
hind
legs
and
makes
every
effort
to
get
at
my
face
i
have
tried
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
of
that
but
in
vain
she
will
have
her
own
way
i
have
no
other
animals
for
the
moment
that
are
worth
showing
unless
you
would
care
to
hear
a
song
if
so
there
is
uranus
who
is
a
professional
singer
we
take
the
trio
with
us
and
you
shall
hear
we
made
for
two
dogs
that
were
lying
by
themselves
on
the
snow
a
little
way
off
while
the
three
jumped
and
danced
about
us
as
we
approached
the
other
two
and
they
caught
sight
of
the
trio
they
both
jumped
up
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
and
i
guessed
that
we
had
found
the
singer
lord
save
us
what
an
awful
voice
i
could
see
that
the
concert
was
for
lasse
benefit
and
uranus
kept
it
up
as
long
as
we
stood
in
his
vicinity
but
then
my
attention
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
another
trio
which
made
an
extraordinary
favourable
impression
i
turned
to
my
companion
for
information
yes
he
continued
those
are
three
of
hanssen
team
probably
some
of
our
best
animals
the
big
one
is
called
zanko
he
appears
to
be
rather
old
the
two
others
which
look
like
sausages
with
matches
underneath
are
ring
and
mylius
as
you
see
they
are
not
very
big
rather
on
the
small
side
but
they
are
undoubtedly
among
our
best
workers
from
their
looks
we
have
concluded
that
they
are
brothers
they
are
as
like
as
two
drops
of
water
now
we
will
go
straight
through
the
mass
and
see
whether
we
come
across
any
more
celebrities
there
we
have
karenius
sauen
schwartz
and
lucy
they
belong
to
stubberud
and
are
a
power
in
the
camp
bjaaland
tent
is
close
by
his
favourites
are
lying
there
kvaen
lap
pan
gorki
and
jaala
they
are
small
all
of
them
but
fine
dogs
there
in
the
corner
stands
hassel
tent
but
we
shall
not
see
any
of
his
dogs
here
now
they
are
all
lying
outside
the
entrance
to
the
where
he
is
generally
to
be
found
the
next
tent
is
wisting
we
must
take
a
turn
round
there
and
see
if
we
can
find
his
lot
there
they
are
those
four
playing
there
the
big
one
on
the
right
is
the
colonel
our
handsomest
animal
his
three
companions
are
suggen
arne
and
brun
i
must
tell
you
a
little
story
about
the
colonel
when
he
was
on
flekkero
he
was
perfectly
wild
then
and
he
broke
loose
and
jumped
into
the
sea
he
was
discovered
till
he
was
between
flekkero
and
the
mainland
where
he
was
probably
going
in
search
of
a
joint
of
mutton
wisting
and
lindstrom
who
were
then
in
charge
of
the
dogs
put
off
in
a
boat
and
finally
succeeded
in
overtaking
him
but
they
had
a
hard
tussle
before
they
managed
to
get
him
on
board
afterwards
wisting
had
a
with
the
colonel
but
i
do
remember
what
was
the
result
we
can
expect
a
great
deal
of
these
dogs
there
johansen
tent
over
in
the
corner
there
is
not
much
to
be
said
about
his
dogs
the
most
remarkable
of
them
is
camilla
she
is
an
excellent
mother
and
brings
up
her
children
very
well
she
usually
has
a
whole
army
of
them
too
now
i
expect
you
have
seen
dogs
enough
so
if
you
have
no
objection
i
will
show
you
underground
framheim
and
what
goes
on
there
i
may
just
as
well
add
that
we
are
proud
of
this
work
and
you
will
probably
find
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
we
begin
with
hassel
as
his
department
is
nearest
we
now
went
in
the
direction
of
the
house
passed
its
western
end
and
soon
arrived
at
an
erection
that
looked
like
a
derrick
underneath
it
was
a
large
where
the
three
legs
of
the
derrick
met
there
was
made
fast
a
small
block
and
through
the
block
ran
a
rope
made
fast
at
one
end
to
the
a
weight
hung
at
the
other
end
some
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
snow
now
we
are
at
hassel
said
my
companion
it
was
a
good
thing
he
could
not
see
me
for
i
must
have
looked
rather
foolish
at
hassel
i
said
to
myself
what
in
the
world
does
the
man
mean
we
were
standing
on
the
bare
barrier
do
you
hear
that
noise
that
hassel
sawing
wood
now
he
bent
down
and
raised
the
heavy
easily
with
the
help
of
the
weight
broad
steps
of
snow
led
down
deep
down
into
the
barrier
we
left
the
open
so
as
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
little
daylight
there
was
my
host
went
first
i
followed
after
descending
four
or
five
steps
we
came
to
a
doorway
which
was
covered
with
a
woollen
curtain
we
pushed
this
aside
the
sound
that
had
first
reached
me
as
a
low
rumbling
now
became
sharper
and
i
could
plainly
hear
that
it
was
caused
by
sawing
we
went
in
the
room
we
entered
was
long
and
narrow
cut
out
of
the
barrier
on
a
solid
shelf
of
snow
there
lay
barrel
after
barrel
arranged
in
exemplary
order
if
they
were
all
full
of
paraffin
i
began
to
understand
extravagance
in
lighting
his
fire
in
the
morning
here
was
paraffin
enough
for
several
years
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
lantern
was
hanging
an
ordinary
one
with
wire
netting
round
the
glass
in
a
dark
room
it
certainly
would
not
have
given
much
light
but
in
these
white
surroundings
it
shone
like
the
sun
a
primus
lamp
was
burning
on
the
floor
the
thermometer
which
hung
a
little
way
from
the
primus
showed
so
hassel
could
hardly
complain
of
the
heat
but
he
had
to
saw
so
it
did
not
matter
we
approached
hassel
he
looked
as
if
he
had
plenty
to
do
and
was
sawing
away
so
that
the
sawdust
was
flying
the
sawdust
flew
faster
and
faster
you
seem
to
be
busy
oh
yes
the
saw
was
now
working
with
dangerous
rapidity
if
i
to
get
finished
for
the
holiday
i
must
hurry
up
how
the
getting
on
that
took
effect
the
saw
stopped
instantly
was
raised
and
put
down
by
the
wall
i
waited
for
the
next
step
in
suppressed
excitement
something
hitherto
undreamt
of
must
be
going
to
happen
hassel
looked
round
one
can
never
be
careful
enough
approached
my
host
and
whispered
with
every
sign
of
caution
i
did
him
out
of
kilos
last
week
i
breathed
again
i
had
expected
something
much
worse
than
that
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
hassel
resumed
his
interrupted
work
and
i
believe
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
stopped
him
again
the
last
i
saw
as
we
returned
through
the
doorway
was
hassel
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
sawdust
we
were
back
on
the
barrier
surface
a
touch
of
the
finger
and
the
swung
over
and
fell
noiselessly
into
its
place
i
could
see
that
hassel
was
capable
of
other
things
besides
sawing
birchwood
outside
lay
his
team
guarding
all
his
movements
mikkel
raeven
masmas
and
else
they
all
looked
well
now
we
were
going
to
see
the
others
we
went
over
to
the
entrance
of
the
hut
and
raised
the
a
dazzling
light
met
my
eyes
in
the
wall
of
the
steps
leading
down
from
the
surface
a
recess
had
been
cut
to
hold
a
wooden
case
lined
with
bright
tin
this
contained
a
little
lamp
which
produced
this
powerful
light
but
it
was
the
surroundings
that
made
it
so
bright
ice
and
snow
everywhere
now
i
could
look
about
me
for
the
first
time
it
had
been
dark
when
i
came
in
the
morning
there
was
the
leading
to
the
i
could
see
that
by
the
threshold
that
grinned
at
me
but
there
in
the
opposite
direction
what
was
there
i
could
see
that
the
passage
was
continued
but
where
did
it
lead
standing
in
the
bright
light
it
looked
quite
dark
in
the
tunnel
now
we
will
go
and
see
bjaaland
first
with
these
words
my
companion
bent
down
and
set
off
through
the
dark
passage
look
there
in
the
just
under
our
feet
can
you
see
the
light
by
degrees
my
eyes
had
accustomed
themselves
to
the
darkness
of
the
tunnel
and
i
could
see
a
greenish
light
shining
through
the
where
he
pointed
and
now
another
noise
fell
on
my
ears
a
monotonous
sound
coming
from
below
look
out
for
the
steps
yes
he
could
be
sure
of
that
i
had
come
one
cropper
that
day
and
it
was
enough
we
once
more
descended
into
the
barrier
by
broad
solid
covered
with
boards
suddenly
a
door
was
opened
a
in
the
and
i
stood
in
bjaaland
and
stubberud
premises
the
place
might
be
about
feet
high
feet
long
and
feet
wide
on
the
floor
lay
masses
of
shavings
which
made
it
warm
and
cosy
at
one
end
stood
a
primus
lamp
with
a
large
tin
case
over
it
from
which
steam
was
issuing
how
is
it
going
all
right
we
just
bending
the
runners
made
a
rough
estimate
of
the
weight
and
find
i
can
bring
it
down
to
pounds
this
seemed
to
me
almost
incredible
amundsen
had
told
me
on
the
way
up
this
morning
of
the
heavy
sledges
they
had
pounds
each
and
now
bjaaland
was
going
to
bring
them
down
to
pounds
less
than
a
third
of
their
original
weight
in
the
of
the
room
were
fixed
hooks
and
shelves
where
the
tools
were
kept
bjaaland
carpenter
bench
was
massive
enough
cut
out
in
the
snow
and
covered
with
boards
along
the
opposite
wall
was
another
equally
massive
but
somewhat
shorter
than
the
first
this
was
evidently
stubberud
place
he
was
not
here
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
engaged
in
planing
down
the
sledge
cases
and
making
them
lighter
one
of
them
was
finished
i
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
it
on
the
top
where
a
little
round
aluminium
lid
was
let
in
was
written
original
weight
kilos
reduced
weight
kilos
i
could
understand
what
this
saving
of
weight
meant
to
men
who
were
going
on
such
a
journey
as
these
had
before
them
one
lamp
provided
all
the
illumination
but
it
gave
an
excellent
light
we
left
bjaaland
i
felt
sure
that
the
sledging
outfit
was
in
the
best
of
hands
we
then
made
our
way
into
the
and
here
we
met
stubberud
he
was
engaged
in
cleaning
up
and
putting
things
straight
for
the
holiday
all
the
steam
that
came
out
of
the
kitchen
when
the
door
was
opened
had
condensed
on
the
roof
and
walls
in
the
form
of
rime
several
inches
thick
and
stubberud
was
now
clearing
this
off
with
a
long
broom
everything
was
going
to
be
shipshape
for
midwinter
eve
i
could
see
that
we
went
in
dinner
was
on
humming
and
boiling
the
kitchen
floor
was
scrubbed
clean
and
the
linoleum
with
which
it
was
covered
shone
gaily
it
was
the
same
in
the
everything
was
cleaned
the
linoleum
on
the
floor
and
the
american
cloth
on
the
table
were
equally
bright
the
air
was
pure
absolutely
pure
all
the
bunks
were
made
tidy
and
the
stools
put
in
their
places
there
was
no
one
here
you
have
only
seen
a
fraction
of
our
underground
palaces
but
i
thought
we
would
take
a
turn
in
the
loft
first
and
see
what
it
is
like
follow
me
we
went
out
into
the
kitchen
and
then
up
some
steps
fastened
in
the
wall
and
through
the
to
the
loft
with
the
help
of
a
little
electric
lamp
we
were
able
to
look
about
us
the
first
thing
that
met
my
eyes
was
the
library
there
stood
the
framheim
library
and
it
made
the
same
good
impression
as
everything
else
books
numbered
from
to
in
three
shelves
the
catalogue
lay
by
the
side
of
them
and
i
cast
my
eye
over
it
here
were
books
to
suit
all
tastes
librarian
adolf
henrik
lindstrom
i
read
at
the
end
so
he
was
librarian
a
man
long
rows
of
cases
stood
here
full
of
whortleberry
jam
cranberries
syrup
cream
sugar
and
pickles
in
one
corner
i
saw
every
sign
of
a
a
curtain
was
hung
up
to
keep
the
light
off
and
there
was
an
array
of
etc
this
loft
was
made
good
use
of
we
had
now
seen
everything
and
descended
again
to
continue
our
inspection
just
as
we
reached
the
lindstrom
came
in
with
a
big
bucket
of
ice
i
understood
that
it
was
to
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
water
my
companion
had
armed
himself
with
a
large
and
powerful
lantern
and
i
saw
that
we
were
going
to
begin
our
underground
travels
in
the
north
wall
of
the
there
was
a
door
and
through
this
we
went
entering
a
passage
built
against
the
house
and
dark
as
the
grave
the
lantern
had
lost
its
power
of
illumination
it
burned
with
a
dull
dead
light
which
did
not
seem
to
penetrate
beyond
the
glass
i
stretched
my
hands
in
front
of
me
my
host
stopped
and
gave
me
a
lecture
on
the
wonderful
order
and
tidiness
they
had
succeeded
in
establishing
among
them
i
was
a
willing
listener
for
i
had
already
seen
enough
to
be
able
to
certify
the
truth
of
what
he
told
me
without
hesitation
but
in
the
place
we
were
now
in
i
had
to
take
his
word
for
it
for
it
was
all
as
black
as
we
had
just
started
to
move
on
again
and
i
felt
so
secure
after
all
he
had
told
me
about
the
orderly
way
things
were
kept
that
i
let
go
my
guide
anorak
which
i
had
been
holding
but
that
was
foolish
of
me
smack
i
went
down
at
full
length
i
had
trodden
on
something
round
something
that
brought
me
down
as
i
fell
i
caught
hold
of
something
also
round
and
i
lay
convulsively
clutching
it
i
wanted
to
convince
myself
of
what
it
was
that
lay
about
on
the
floor
of
such
a
tidy
house
the
glimmer
of
the
lantern
though
not
particularly
strong
was
enough
to
show
me
what
i
held
in
my
arms
a
dutch
cheese
i
put
it
back
in
the
same
place
for
the
sake
of
tidiness
sat
up
and
looked
down
at
my
feet
what
was
it
i
had
stumbled
over
a
dutch
cheese
if
it
was
another
of
the
same
family
i
began
to
form
my
own
opinion
of
the
tidiness
now
but
said
nothing
but
i
should
like
to
know
why
he
did
fall
over
the
cheeses
as
he
was
walking
in
front
oh
i
answered
myself
i
guess
he
knew
what
sort
of
order
the
place
was
in
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
house
the
passage
was
brilliantly
lighted
up
by
the
window
that
looked
out
on
this
side
i
could
now
see
more
clearly
where
i
was
opposite
the
window
in
the
part
of
the
barrier
that
here
formed
the
other
wall
of
the
passage
a
great
hole
had
been
dug
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
it
but
black
darkness
my
companion
knew
his
way
so
i
could
rely
upon
him
but
i
should
have
hesitated
to
go
in
there
alone
the
hole
extended
into
the
barrier
and
finally
formed
a
fairly
large
room
with
a
vaulted
roof
a
spade
and
an
axe
on
the
floor
were
all
i
saw
what
in
the
world
was
this
hall
used
for
you
see
all
the
ice
and
snow
from
here
has
gone
to
our
so
this
was
lindstrom
quarry
from
which
he
had
hewn
out
ice
and
snow
all
these
months
for
cooking
drinking
and
washing
in
one
of
the
walls
close
to
the
floor
there
was
a
little
hole
just
big
enough
for
a
man
to
crawl
through
now
you
must
make
yourself
small
and
follow
me
we
are
going
to
visit
hanssen
and
wisting
and
my
companion
disappeared
like
a
snake
into
the
hole
i
threw
myself
down
quick
as
lightning
and
followed
i
would
not
have
cared
to
be
left
alone
there
in
i
managed
to
get
hold
of
one
of
his
calves
and
did
not
let
go
until
i
saw
light
on
the
other
side
the
passage
we
crept
through
was
equally
narrow
all
the
way
and
forced
one
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
fortunately
it
was
not
long
it
ended
in
a
fairly
large
square
room
a
low
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
on
it
helmer
hanssen
was
engaged
in
lashing
sledges
the
room
gave
one
the
impression
of
being
badly
lighted
though
it
had
a
lamp
and
candles
on
a
closer
examination
i
found
that
this
was
due
to
the
number
of
dark
objects
the
place
contained
against
one
of
the
walls
there
was
clothing
immense
piles
of
skin
clothing
over
this
were
spread
blankets
to
protect
it
from
the
rime
that
was
formed
on
the
roof
and
fell
down
against
the
opposite
wall
was
a
stack
of
sledges
and
at
the
end
opposite
the
door
were
piles
of
woollen
underclothing
any
outfitter
in
christiania
might
have
envied
this
stock
here
one
saw
iceland
jackets
sweaters
underclothes
of
immense
thickness
and
dimensions
stockings
mits
etc
in
the
corner
formed
by
this
wall
and
the
one
where
the
sledges
stood
was
the
little
hole
by
which
we
had
entered
beyond
the
sledges
in
the
same
wall
there
was
a
door
with
a
curtain
in
front
of
it
and
from
within
it
came
a
strange
humming
i
was
much
interested
to
know
what
this
might
be
but
had
to
hear
first
what
these
two
had
to
say
what
do
you
think
of
the
lashings
now
hanssen
oh
they
hold
right
enough
at
any
rate
they
be
better
than
they
were
before
look
here
how
they
pointed
the
ends
i
leaned
forward
to
see
what
was
wrong
with
the
and
i
must
say
what
i
saw
surprised
me
is
such
a
thing
possible
the
pointing
of
a
lashing
is
a
thing
a
sailor
is
very
careful
about
he
knows
that
if
the
end
is
badly
pointed
it
does
not
matter
how
well
the
lashing
is
put
on
therefore
it
is
an
invariable
rule
that
lashings
must
be
pointed
as
carefully
as
possible
when
i
looked
at
this
one
what
do
you
think
i
saw
why
the
end
of
the
lashing
was
nailed
down
with
a
little
tack
such
as
one
would
use
to
fasten
labels
that
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
take
to
the
pole
this
final
observation
of
hanssen
was
doubtless
the
mildest
expression
of
what
he
thought
of
the
work
i
saw
how
the
new
lashings
were
being
put
on
and
i
was
quite
ready
to
agree
with
hanssen
that
they
would
do
the
work
it
was
by
the
way
no
easy
job
this
lashing
at
as
the
thermometer
showed
but
hanssen
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
i
had
heard
that
wisting
also
took
part
in
this
work
but
he
was
not
to
be
seen
where
could
he
be
my
eyes
involuntarily
sought
the
curtain
behind
which
the
humming
sound
was
audible
i
was
now
ready
to
burst
with
curiosity
at
last
the
lashing
question
appears
to
be
thrashed
out
and
my
companion
shows
signs
of
moving
on
he
leaves
his
lantern
and
goes
up
to
the
curtain
wisting
yes
the
answer
seems
to
come
from
a
far
distance
the
humming
ceases
and
the
curtain
is
thrust
aside
then
i
am
confronted
by
the
sight
that
has
impressed
me
most
of
all
on
this
eventful
day
there
sits
wisting
in
the
middle
of
the
barrier
working
a
the
temperature
outside
is
now
this
seems
to
me
to
require
some
explanation
i
slink
through
the
opening
to
get
a
closer
view
then
ugh
i
am
met
by
a
regular
tropical
blast
i
glance
at
the
thermometer
it
shows
but
how
can
this
be
here
he
is
sewing
in
an
at
i
was
told
in
my
that
ice
melts
at
about
if
the
same
law
is
still
in
operation
he
ought
to
be
sitting
in
a
i
go
right
in
the
is
not
large
about
feet
each
way
besides
the
a
modern
the
room
contains
a
number
of
instruments
compasses
and
so
forth
besides
the
large
tent
he
is
now
working
on
but
what
interests
me
most
is
the
way
in
which
he
circumvents
the
i
see
it
now
it
is
very
cleverly
contrived
he
has
covered
the
roof
and
walls
with
tin
and
canvas
so
arranged
that
all
the
melting
ice
goes
the
same
way
and
runs
into
a
that
stands
below
in
this
manner
he
collects
washing
water
which
is
such
a
precious
commodity
in
these
regions
wily
man
i
afterwards
hear
that
nearly
all
the
outfit
for
the
polar
journey
is
being
made
in
this
little
well
with
men
like
these
i
do
think
amundsen
will
deserve
any
credit
for
reaching
the
pole
he
ought
to
be
thrashed
if
he
does
now
we
have
finished
here
and
must
in
all
probability
have
seen
everything
my
guide
goes
over
to
the
wall
where
the
clothing
is
lying
and
begins
to
rummage
in
it
a
clothing
inspection
i
say
to
myself
there
no
great
fun
in
that
i
sit
down
on
the
pile
of
sledges
by
the
opposite
wall
and
am
going
over
in
my
mind
all
i
have
seen
when
suddenly
he
thrusts
his
head
forward
like
a
man
who
is
going
to
make
a
dive
and
disappears
among
the
bundles
of
skins
i
jump
up
and
make
for
the
piles
of
clothing
i
am
beginning
to
feel
quite
lost
in
this
mysterious
world
in
my
hurry
i
collide
with
sledge
which
falls
off
the
table
he
looks
round
furiously
it
is
a
good
thing
he
could
not
see
me
he
looked
like
murder
i
squeeze
in
between
the
bundles
of
clothing
and
what
do
i
see
another
hole
in
the
wall
another
low
dark
passage
i
pluck
up
courage
and
plunge
in
this
tunnel
is
rather
higher
than
the
other
and
i
can
walk
bending
double
fortunately
the
light
at
the
other
end
shows
up
at
once
so
that
my
journey
in
the
dark
is
not
a
long
one
this
time
i
come
out
into
another
large
room
of
about
the
same
size
as
the
last
and
afterwards
learn
that
it
is
known
as
the
crystal
palace
the
name
is
appropriate
as
crystals
sparkle
on
every
side
against
one
wall
a
number
of
pairs
of
ski
are
resting
elsewhere
there
are
cases
some
yellow
and
some
black
i
guess
the
meaning
of
this
at
once
after
my
visit
to
stubberud
the
yellow
cases
are
the
original
ones
and
the
black
the
improved
ones
they
think
of
everything
here
of
course
in
snow
black
is
a
far
better
colour
than
light
yellow
the
cases
will
be
pleasanter
to
look
at
and
very
much
easier
to
see
at
a
distance
and
if
they
happen
to
run
short
of
marks
all
they
need
do
will
be
to
break
up
a
case
and
make
as
many
black
marks
as
they
want
they
will
be
easily
seen
in
the
snow
the
lids
of
these
cases
surprise
me
they
are
no
bigger
than
ordinary
large
lids
and
of
the
same
form
they
are
loose
as
with
a
and
are
put
on
in
the
same
way
then
it
suddenly
occurs
to
me
when
i
was
sitting
on
the
sledges
in
hanssen
workshop
i
noticed
little
pieces
of
wire
rope
fixed
to
both
ribs
of
the
sledge
there
were
eight
of
them
on
each
side
just
the
right
number
they
are
lashings
for
four
cases
and
they
will
hardly
take
more
than
that
on
a
sledge
on
one
rib
all
the
wire
ropes
ended
in
eyes
on
the
other
they
ended
in
thin
lashings
obviously
there
were
four
of
them
to
each
case
two
forward
and
two
aft
of
the
lid
if
these
were
reeved
and
drawn
taut
the
cases
would
be
held
as
in
a
vice
and
the
lids
could
be
taken
off
freely
at
any
time
it
was
an
ingenious
idea
which
would
save
a
lot
of
work
but
there
sits
johansen
in
the
middle
of
the
palace
packing
he
seems
to
have
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
he
looks
so
profoundly
thoughtful
before
him
is
a
case
half
packed
marked
sledge
no
case
no
more
singular
contents
i
have
never
seen
a
mixture
of
pemmican
and
sausage
i
have
never
heard
of
sausages
on
a
sledge
journey
it
must
be
something
quite
new
the
pieces
of
pemmican
are
cylindrical
in
shape
about
inches
high
and
and
inches
in
diameter
when
they
are
packed
there
will
be
large
openings
between
every
four
of
them
each
of
these
openings
is
filled
up
with
a
sausage
which
stands
straight
up
and
down
and
is
of
exactly
the
height
of
the
case
but
sausage
let
me
see
ah
a
sausage
with
a
tear
in
its
skin
i
run
across
and
look
at
it
oh
the
cunning
rascals
if
it
is
they
are
smuggling
in
like
this
so
every
bit
of
space
is
utilized
the
gaps
left
by
these
round
pieces
of
pemmican
at
the
sides
of
the
cases
are
of
course
only
half
as
large
as
the
rest
and
so
can
not
take
a
but
do
imagine
that
the
space
is
wasted
no
chocolate
is
broken
up
into
small
pieces
and
stowed
in
there
when
all
these
cases
are
packed
they
will
be
as
full
as
if
they
were
of
solid
wood
there
is
one
ready
packed
i
must
see
what
it
contains
biscuits
biscuits
is
marked
on
the
lid
they
say
that
angels
are
specially
gifted
with
patience
but
theirs
must
be
a
trifle
compared
with
johansen
there
was
absolutely
not
a
fraction
of
an
inch
left
in
that
case
the
crystal
palace
at
present
reminds
one
strongly
of
a
grocer
and
chandler
store
pemmican
biscuits
chocolate
and
lie
about
everywhere
in
the
other
wall
opposite
the
ski
there
is
an
opening
i
see
my
companion
making
for
it
but
this
time
i
intend
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
he
goes
up
two
steps
pushes
a
and
there
he
stands
on
the
barrier
but
i
am
there
too
the
is
replaced
and
i
see
that
we
are
close
to
another
door
in
the
barrier
but
this
is
a
modern
it
leads
into
the
clothing
store
i
turn
to
my
host
and
give
him
my
best
thanks
for
the
interesting
circular
trip
through
the
barrier
expressing
my
admiration
of
all
the
fine
engineering
works
i
have
seen
and
so
on
he
cuts
me
short
with
the
remark
that
we
are
not
nearly
done
yet
he
has
only
brought
me
up
this
way
to
save
my
having
to
crawl
back
again
we
are
going
in
now
he
adds
to
continue
our
journey
under
the
surface
i
see
that
there
is
no
getting
out
of
it
although
i
am
beginning
to
have
enough
of
these
underground
passages
my
host
seems
to
guess
my
thoughts
as
he
adds
we
must
see
them
now
when
the
men
are
working
afterwards
they
will
not
have
the
same
interest
i
see
that
he
is
right
pull
myself
together
and
follow
him
but
fate
wills
it
otherwise
as
we
come
out
on
the
barrier
hanssen
is
standing
there
with
his
sledge
and
six
fresh
dogs
harnessed
my
companion
has
just
time
to
whisper
to
me
jump
on
i
wait
here
when
the
sledge
starts
off
at
a
terrific
pace
with
me
as
a
passenger
unsuspected
by
hanssen
we
went
along
so
that
the
snow
dashed
over
us
he
had
his
dogs
well
in
hand
this
fellow
i
could
see
that
but
they
were
a
wild
lot
of
rascals
he
had
to
deal
with
i
heard
the
names
of
hok
and
togo
in
particular
they
seemed
inclined
for
mischief
all
of
a
sudden
they
darted
back
on
their
companions
under
the
traces
and
got
the
whole
team
in
a
tangle
but
they
were
not
able
to
do
very
much
as
the
whip
which
was
wielded
with
great
dexterity
constantly
sang
about
their
ears
the
two
sausages
i
had
noticed
on
the
slope
ring
and
mylius
were
leaders
they
too
were
full
of
pranks
but
kept
their
places
hai
and
rap
were
also
in
the
team
rap
whose
ear
was
split
would
have
liked
very
much
to
get
his
friend
hai
to
join
in
a
little
fight
with
hok
and
togo
but
for
the
whip
it
swished
to
and
fro
in
and
out
among
them
without
mercy
and
made
them
behave
like
good
boys
after
us
some
yards
behind
came
zanko
he
seemed
to
be
put
out
because
he
had
not
been
harnessed
meanwhile
we
went
at
a
gallop
up
the
hill
to
the
depot
and
the
last
flag
was
passed
there
was
a
marked
difference
in
the
daylight
here
now
it
was
eleven
and
the
flush
of
dawn
had
risen
a
good
way
in
the
sky
and
was
approaching
the
north
the
numbers
and
marks
on
the
cases
were
easily
visible
hanssen
drew
up
smartly
by
the
rows
of
cases
and
halted
we
stepped
off
the
sledge
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
looked
round
then
turned
the
sledge
over
with
the
runners
in
the
air
i
supposed
he
did
this
to
prevent
the
dogs
making
off
when
his
back
was
turned
personally
i
thought
it
was
a
poor
safeguard
i
jumped
up
on
a
case
and
sat
there
to
await
what
developments
might
come
and
they
came
in
the
form
of
zanko
hanssen
had
moved
off
a
little
way
with
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
examining
the
cases
as
he
went
along
zanko
had
now
reached
his
friends
ring
and
mylius
and
the
meeting
was
a
very
cordial
one
on
both
sides
this
was
too
much
for
hok
he
was
on
to
them
like
a
rocket
followed
by
his
friend
togo
hai
and
rap
never
let
such
an
opportunity
escape
them
and
they
eagerly
flung
themselves
into
the
thick
of
the
fight
stop
that
you
blackguards
it
was
hanssen
who
threw
this
admonition
in
advance
as
he
came
rushing
back
zanko
who
was
free
had
kept
his
head
sufficiently
to
observe
the
approaching
danger
without
much
hesitation
he
cut
away
and
made
for
framheim
with
all
possible
speed
whether
the
others
missed
their
sixth
combatant
or
whether
they
too
became
aware
of
hanssen
threatening
approach
i
am
unable
to
determine
certain
it
is
that
they
all
got
clear
of
each
other
as
though
at
a
given
signal
and
made
off
the
same
way
the
capsized
sledge
made
no
difference
to
them
they
went
like
the
wind
over
the
slope
and
disappeared
by
the
flagstaff
hanssen
did
not
take
long
to
make
up
his
mind
but
what
was
the
use
he
went
as
fast
as
he
could
no
doubt
but
had
reached
no
farther
than
to
the
flagstaff
when
the
dogs
with
the
capsized
sledge
behind
them
ran
into
framheim
and
were
stopped
there
i
went
quietly
back
well
pleased
with
the
additional
experience
down
on
the
level
i
met
hanssen
on
his
way
to
the
depot
a
second
time
he
looked
extremely
angry
and
the
way
in
which
he
used
the
whip
did
not
promise
well
for
the
dogs
backs
zanko
was
now
harnessed
in
the
team
on
my
return
to
framheim
i
saw
no
one
so
i
slipped
into
the
and
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
getting
into
the
kitchen
this
was
not
long
in
coming
puffing
and
gasping
like
a
small
locomotive
lindstrom
swung
in
from
the
passage
that
led
round
the
house
in
his
arms
he
again
carried
the
big
bucket
full
of
ice
and
an
electric
lamp
hung
from
his
mouth
in
order
to
open
the
he
had
only
to
give
it
a
push
with
his
knee
i
slipped
in
the
house
was
empty
now
i
thought
i
shall
have
a
good
chance
of
seeing
what
lindstrom
does
when
he
is
left
alone
he
put
down
the
bucket
of
ice
and
gradually
filled
up
the
which
was
on
the
fire
then
he
looked
at
the
clock
a
eleven
good
dinner
will
be
ready
in
time
he
drew
a
long
deep
sigh
then
went
into
the
room
filled
and
lit
his
pipe
thereupon
he
sat
down
and
took
up
a
doll
that
was
sitting
on
a
his
whole
face
lighted
up
one
could
see
how
pleased
he
was
he
wound
up
the
doll
and
put
it
on
the
table
as
soon
as
he
let
it
go
it
began
to
turn
somersaults
one
after
another
endlessly
and
lindstrom
well
he
laughed
till
he
must
have
been
near
convulsions
crying
out
all
the
while
right
olava
go
it
again
i
then
looked
at
the
doll
carefully
and
it
was
certainly
something
out
of
the
common
the
head
was
that
of
an
old
woman
evidently
a
disagreeable
old
maid
with
yellow
hair
a
hanging
and
a
expression
she
wore
a
dress
of
check
and
when
she
turned
head
over
heels
it
caused
as
might
be
expected
some
disturbance
of
her
costume
the
figure
one
could
see
had
originally
been
an
acrobat
but
these
ingenious
polar
explorers
had
transformed
it
into
this
hideous
shape
when
the
experiment
was
repeated
and
i
understood
the
situation
i
could
not
help
roaring
too
but
lindstrom
was
so
deeply
occupied
that
he
did
not
hear
me
after
amusing
himself
for
about
ten
minutes
with
this
he
got
tired
of
olava
and
put
her
up
on
the
weight
again
she
sat
there
nodding
and
bowing
until
she
was
forgotten
meanwhile
lindstrom
had
gone
to
his
bunk
and
was
lying
half
in
it
now
i
thought
to
myself
he
is
going
to
take
a
little
nap
before
dinner
but
no
he
came
out
again
at
once
holding
a
tattered
old
pack
of
cards
in
his
hand
he
went
back
to
his
place
and
began
a
quiet
and
serious
game
of
patience
it
did
not
take
long
and
was
probably
not
very
complicated
but
it
served
its
purpose
one
could
see
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
him
whenever
a
card
came
in
its
right
place
finally
all
the
cards
were
in
order
he
had
finished
the
game
he
sat
a
little
while
longer
enjoying
the
sight
of
the
finished
packs
then
he
picked
them
all
up
with
a
sigh
and
rose
mumbling
yes
he
get
to
the
pole
that
sure
and
what
more
get
there
first
he
put
the
cards
back
on
the
shelf
in
his
bunk
and
looked
well
pleased
with
himself
then
the
process
of
laying
the
table
began
once
more
but
with
far
less
noise
than
in
the
morning
there
was
nobody
to
be
annoyed
by
it
now
at
five
minutes
to
twelve
a
big
ship
bell
was
rung
and
not
long
after
the
diners
began
to
arrive
they
did
not
make
any
elaborate
toilet
but
sat
down
to
table
at
once
the
dishes
were
not
many
a
thick
black
seal
soup
with
all
manner
of
curious
things
in
it
seal
meat
cut
into
small
dice
is
no
doubt
the
expression
but
it
would
be
misleading
here
large
dice
we
had
better
call
them
with
potatoes
carrots
cabbage
turnips
peas
celery
prunes
and
apples
i
should
like
to
know
what
our
cooks
at
home
would
call
that
dish
two
large
jugs
of
syrup
and
water
stood
on
the
table
now
i
had
another
surprise
i
was
under
the
impression
that
a
dinner
like
this
passed
off
in
silence
but
that
was
by
no
means
the
case
here
they
talked
the
whole
time
and
the
conversation
chiefly
turned
on
what
they
had
been
doing
during
the
forenoon
for
dessert
they
had
some
green
plums
pipes
and
books
soon
made
their
appearance
by
about
two
the
boys
gave
fresh
signs
of
life
i
knew
they
were
not
going
to
work
that
afternoon
hans
eve
but
habit
is
a
strange
thing
bjaaland
rose
in
a
peremptory
fashion
and
asked
who
was
going
to
have
the
first
turn
after
a
lot
of
questions
and
answers
it
was
decided
that
hassel
should
be
the
first
what
it
was
i
could
not
make
out
i
heard
them
talk
about
one
or
two
primuses
and
say
that
half
an
hour
was
the
most
one
could
stand
but
that
did
not
mean
anything
to
me
i
should
have
to
stick
to
hassel
he
was
going
first
if
there
should
be
no
second
man
i
should
at
any
rate
have
seen
what
the
first
one
did
everything
became
quiet
again
it
was
only
in
the
kitchen
that
one
could
tell
that
the
barrier
was
inhabited
at
two
bjaaland
who
had
been
out
came
in
and
announced
that
now
it
was
all
a
mass
of
steam
i
watched
hassel
anxiously
yes
this
announcement
seemed
to
put
life
into
him
he
got
up
and
began
to
undress
very
strange
i
thought
what
can
this
be
i
tried
the
sherlock
holmes
method
first
bjaaland
goes
out
that
is
fact
number
one
then
he
comes
back
that
i
could
also
make
sure
of
so
far
the
method
worked
well
but
then
comes
the
third
item
it
is
all
a
mass
of
steam
what
in
the
world
does
that
mean
the
man
has
gone
out
if
not
out
on
to
the
barrier
then
certainly
into
it
into
and
then
he
comes
back
and
says
that
it
is
all
a
mass
of
steam
it
seems
ridiculous
absurd
i
send
sherlock
holmes
to
the
deuce
and
watch
hassel
with
increasing
excitement
if
he
takes
any
more
off
i
felt
i
was
blushing
and
half
turned
my
head
but
there
he
stopped
then
he
picked
up
a
towel
and
away
we
went
out
through
the
door
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
follow
him
along
the
snow
tunnel
in
nothing
but
here
steam
really
began
to
meet
us
getting
thicker
and
thicker
as
we
came
into
the
barrier
the
tunnel
became
so
full
of
steam
that
i
could
see
nothing
i
thought
with
longing
of
the
tail
of
amundsen
anorak
that
was
so
useful
on
such
occasions
but
here
there
was
nothing
to
take
hold
of
far
away
in
the
fog
i
could
see
a
light
and
made
my
way
to
it
with
caution
before
i
knew
where
i
was
i
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
which
led
into
a
large
room
covered
with
rime
and
closed
overhead
by
a
mighty
dome
of
ice
the
steam
was
troublesome
and
spoilt
my
view
of
the
room
but
what
had
become
of
hassel
i
could
only
see
bjaaland
then
suddenly
the
fog
seemed
to
clear
for
an
instant
and
i
caught
sight
of
a
bare
leg
disappearing
into
a
big
black
box
and
a
moment
later
i
saw
smiling
face
on
the
top
of
the
box
a
shudder
passed
through
my
frame
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
decapitated
on
further
consideration
his
features
were
too
smiling
the
head
could
not
be
severed
from
the
body
yet
now
the
steam
began
to
clear
away
little
by
little
and
at
last
one
could
see
clearly
what
was
going
on
i
had
to
laugh
it
was
all
very
easy
to
understand
now
but
i
think
sherlock
holmes
would
have
found
it
a
to
crack
if
he
had
been
set
down
blindfold
on
the
antarctic
barrier
as
i
was
so
to
speak
and
asked
to
explain
the
situation
it
was
one
of
those
folding
american
that
hassel
sat
in
the
bathroom
which
had
looked
so
spacious
and
elegant
in
the
fog
reduced
itself
to
a
little
of
insignificant
appearance
the
steam
was
now
collected
in
the
bath
and
one
could
see
by
the
face
above
that
it
was
beginning
to
be
warm
there
the
last
thing
i
saw
bjaaland
do
was
to
pump
two
primus
lamps
that
were
placed
just
under
the
bath
up
to
high
pressure
and
then
disappear
what
a
lesson
an
actor
might
have
had
in
watching
the
face
before
me
it
began
with
such
a
pleasant
expression
was
written
upon
it
in
the
brightest
characters
then
by
degrees
the
smile
wore
off
and
gave
place
to
seriousness
but
this
did
not
last
long
there
was
a
trembling
of
the
nostrils
and
very
soon
it
could
clearly
be
seen
that
the
bath
was
no
longer
of
a
pleasant
nature
the
complexion
from
being
normal
had
changed
to
an
tint
the
eyes
opened
wider
and
wider
and
i
was
anxiously
awaiting
a
catastrophe
it
came
but
in
a
very
different
form
from
that
i
had
expected
suddenly
and
noiselessly
the
bath
was
raised
and
the
steam
poured
out
laying
a
soft
white
curtain
over
what
followed
i
could
see
nothing
only
heard
that
the
two
primuses
were
turned
down
i
think
it
took
about
five
minutes
for
the
steam
to
disappear
and
what
did
i
see
then
hassel
bright
as
a
new
shilling
dressed
in
his
best
for
hans
eve
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
first
and
probably
the
only
on
the
antarctic
barrier
it
was
like
everything
else
i
had
seen
very
ingeniously
contrived
the
bath
was
a
high
box
without
bottom
and
with
a
hole
large
enough
for
the
head
in
the
top
ail
the
walls
were
double
and
were
made
of
windproof
material
with
about
an
inch
between
for
the
air
to
circulate
this
box
stood
on
a
platform
which
was
raised
a
couple
of
feet
above
the
snow
surface
the
box
fitted
into
a
groove
and
was
thus
absolutely
tight
in
the
platform
immediately
under
the
bath
a
rectangular
opening
was
cut
lined
round
with
rubber
packing
and
into
this
opening
a
tin
box
fitted
accurately
under
the
tin
box
stood
two
primus
lamps
and
now
everyone
will
be
able
to
understand
why
hassel
felt
warm
a
block
hung
from
the
top
of
the
hut
with
a
rope
reeved
in
it
one
end
was
made
fast
to
the
upper
edge
of
the
bath
and
the
other
went
down
into
the
bath
in
this
way
the
bather
himself
could
raise
the
bath
without
assistance
and
free
himself
when
the
heat
became
too
great
the
temperature
outside
the
was
cunning
lads
i
afterwards
heard
that
bjaaland
and
hassel
had
constructed
this
ingenious
bath
i
now
went
back
to
the
house
and
saw
how
they
all
almost
made
use
of
the
by
a
five
all
the
bathing
was
concluded
and
everyone
put
on
his
furs
it
was
evident
that
they
were
going
out
i
followed
the
first
man
who
left
the
hut
he
was
provided
with
a
lantern
and
indeed
it
was
wanted
the
weather
had
changed
a
wind
had
sprung
up
suddenly
and
now
the
air
was
thick
with
snow
it
was
not
a
fall
of
snow
for
one
could
see
the
stars
in
the
zenith
but
snow
caught
up
by
the
wind
and
whirled
along
a
man
had
to
know
the
surroundings
well
to
find
his
way
now
one
had
to
feel
it
was
impossible
to
keep
one
eyes
open
i
took
up
a
position
in
lee
of
a
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
the
dogs
did
not
seem
to
be
inconvenienced
by
the
change
of
weather
some
of
them
lay
curled
up
in
a
ring
with
their
nose
under
their
tail
on
the
snow
while
others
were
running
about
one
by
one
the
men
came
out
each
had
a
lantern
in
his
hand
as
they
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
dogs
were
each
was
surrounded
by
his
team
who
followed
him
to
the
tents
with
joyous
howls
but
everything
did
not
pass
off
peacefully
i
heard
i
think
it
was
in
bjaaland
tent
a
deafening
noise
going
on
and
looked
in
at
the
door
down
there
deep
below
the
surface
they
were
having
a
warm
time
all
the
dogs
were
mixed
up
together
in
one
mass
some
were
biting
some
shrieking
some
howling
in
the
midst
of
this
mass
of
raging
dogs
i
saw
a
human
figure
swinging
round
with
a
bunch
of
in
one
hand
while
he
dealt
blows
right
and
left
with
the
other
and
blessed
the
dogs
all
the
time
i
thought
of
my
calves
and
withdrew
but
the
human
figure
that
i
had
seen
evidently
won
the
mastery
as
the
noise
gradually
subsided
and
all
became
quiet
as
each
man
got
his
dogs
tied
up
he
went
over
to
the
and
took
a
box
of
seal
meat
which
stood
on
the
wall
out
of
the
dogs
reach
this
meat
had
been
cut
up
earlier
in
the
day
by
two
men
they
took
it
in
turns
i
heard
two
men
had
this
duty
daily
the
dogs
were
then
fed
and
half
an
hour
after
this
was
done
the
camp
again
lay
as
i
had
found
it
in
the
morning
quiet
and
peaceful
with
a
temperature
of
and
a
velocity
of
miles
an
hour
the
swept
over
the
barrier
and
whirled
the
snow
high
into
the
air
above
framheim
but
in
their
tents
the
dogs
lay
and
contented
and
felt
nothing
of
the
storm
in
the
hut
preparations
for
a
feast
were
going
on
and
now
one
could
really
appreciate
a
good
house
the
change
from
the
howling
wind
the
driving
snow
the
intense
cold
and
the
absolute
darkness
was
great
indeed
when
one
came
in
everything
was
newly
washed
and
the
table
was
gaily
decorated
small
norwegian
flags
were
everywhere
on
the
table
and
walls
the
festival
began
at
six
and
all
the
vikings
came
merrily
in
lindstrom
had
done
his
best
and
that
is
not
saying
a
little
i
specially
admired
his
powers
and
his
liberality
and
i
think
even
in
the
short
time
i
have
observed
him
he
has
shown
no
sign
of
being
stingy
when
he
appeared
with
the
napoleon
cakes
now
i
must
tell
you
that
these
cakes
were
served
after
every
man
had
put
away
a
quarter
of
a
the
cakes
were
delightful
to
look
at
the
finest
with
layers
of
vanilla
custard
and
cream
they
made
my
mouth
water
but
the
size
of
them
there
could
not
be
one
of
those
mountains
of
cake
to
every
man
one
among
them
all
perhaps
if
they
could
be
expected
to
eat
napoleon
cakes
at
all
after
but
why
had
he
brought
in
eight
two
enormous
dishes
with
four
on
each
good
heavens
one
of
the
vikings
had
just
started
and
was
making
short
work
of
his
mountain
and
one
after
another
they
all
walked
into
them
until
the
whole
eight
had
disappeared
i
should
have
nothing
to
say
about
hunger
misery
and
cold
when
i
came
hone
my
head
was
going
round
the
temperature
must
have
been
as
many
degrees
above
zero
in
here
as
it
was
below
zero
outside
i
looked
up
at
wisting
bunk
where
a
thermometer
was
hanging
the
vikings
did
not
seem
to
take
the
slightest
notice
of
this
trifle
their
work
with
the
napoleons
continued
undisturbed
soon
the
gorgeous
cake
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
cigars
came
out
everyone
without
exception
allowed
himself
this
luxury
up
to
now
they
had
not
shown
much
sign
of
abstinence
i
wanted
to
know
what
was
their
attitude
with
regard
to
strong
drinks
i
had
heard
of
course
that
indulgence
in
alcohol
on
polar
expeditions
was
very
harmful
not
to
say
dangerous
poor
boys
i
thought
to
myself
that
must
be
the
reason
of
your
fondness
for
cake
a
man
must
have
one
vice
at
least
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
drinking
they
make
up
for
it
in
gluttony
yes
now
i
could
see
it
quite
plainly
and
i
was
heartily
sorry
for
them
i
wondered
how
the
napoleons
felt
now
they
looked
rather
depressed
no
doubt
the
cake
took
some
time
to
settle
down
lindstrom
who
now
seemed
unquestionably
the
most
wideawake
of
them
all
came
in
and
began
to
clear
the
table
i
expected
to
see
every
man
roll
into
his
bunk
to
digest
but
no
that
side
of
the
question
did
not
appear
to
trouble
them
much
they
remained
seated
as
though
expecting
more
oh
yes
of
course
there
was
coffee
to
come
lindstrom
was
already
in
the
doorway
with
cups
and
jugs
a
cup
of
coffee
would
be
just
the
thing
after
such
a
meal
stubberud
this
was
lindstrom
voice
calling
from
some
place
in
the
far
distance
hurry
up
before
they
get
warm
i
rushed
after
stubberud
to
see
what
the
things
were
that
were
not
to
get
warm
i
thought
it
might
possibly
be
something
that
was
to
be
taken
outside
great
heaven
there
was
lindstrom
lying
on
his
stomach
up
in
the
loft
and
handing
down
through
the
what
do
you
think
a
bottle
of
benedictine
and
a
bottle
of
punch
both
white
with
frost
now
i
could
see
that
the
fish
were
to
swim
what
more
they
were
to
be
drowned
a
happier
smile
than
that
with
which
stubberud
received
the
bottles
or
more
careful
and
affectionate
handling
than
they
received
on
their
way
through
the
kitchen
i
have
never
seen
i
was
touched
ah
these
boys
knew
how
a
liqueur
should
be
served
must
be
served
cold
was
on
the
label
of
the
punch
bottle
i
can
assure
larsen
that
his
prescription
was
followed
to
the
letter
that
evening
then
the
gramophone
made
its
appearance
and
it
did
me
good
to
see
the
delight
with
which
it
was
received
they
seemed
to
like
this
best
after
all
and
every
man
had
music
to
suit
his
taste
all
agreed
to
honour
the
cook
for
all
his
pains
and
the
concert
therefore
began
with
followed
by
the
apache
waltz
his
part
of
the
programme
was
concluded
with
a
humorous
recitation
meanwhile
he
stood
in
the
doorway
with
a
beatific
smile
this
did
him
good
in
this
way
the
music
went
the
round
and
all
had
their
favourite
tunes
certain
numbers
were
kept
to
the
last
i
could
see
that
they
were
to
the
taste
of
all
first
came
an
air
from
the
huguenots
sung
by
michalowa
this
showed
the
vikings
to
be
musical
it
was
beautifully
sung
but
look
here
cried
an
impatient
voice
are
we
going
to
have
borghild
bryhn
yes
was
the
answer
here
she
comes
and
solveig
song
followed
it
was
a
pity
borghild
bryhn
was
not
there
i
believe
the
most
rapturous
applause
would
not
have
moved
her
so
much
as
the
way
her
song
was
received
here
that
evening
as
the
notes
rang
clear
and
pure
through
the
room
one
could
see
the
faces
grow
serious
no
doubt
the
words
of
the
poem
affected
them
all
as
they
sat
there
in
the
dark
winter
night
on
the
vast
wilderness
of
ice
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
from
all
that
was
dear
to
them
i
think
that
was
so
but
it
was
the
lovely
melody
given
with
perfect
finish
and
rich
natural
powers
that
opened
their
hearts
one
could
see
how
it
did
them
good
it
was
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
afterwards
at
last
one
of
them
could
keep
silence
no
longer
my
word
how
beautifully
she
sings
he
exclaimed
especially
the
ending
i
was
a
little
bit
afraid
that
she
would
give
the
last
note
too
sharp
in
spite
of
the
masterly
way
in
which
she
controls
her
voice
and
it
is
outrageously
high
too
but
instead
of
that
the
note
came
so
pure
and
soft
and
full
that
it
alone
was
enough
to
make
a
better
man
of
one
and
then
this
enthusiastic
listener
tells
them
how
he
once
heard
the
same
song
but
with
a
very
different
result
it
went
quite
well
he
says
until
it
came
to
the
final
note
then
you
could
see
the
singer
fill
her
mighty
bosom
for
the
effort
and
out
came
a
note
so
shrill
that
well
you
remember
the
walls
of
jericho
after
this
the
gramophone
is
put
away
no
one
seems
to
want
any
more
now
it
is
already
eight
it
must
be
nearly
the
feast
has
lasted
long
enough
with
food
drink
and
music
then
they
all
get
on
their
feet
and
there
is
a
cry
of
bow
and
arrows
now
i
say
to
myself
as
i
withdraw
into
the
corner
where
the
clothes
are
hanging
now
the
alcohol
is
beginning
to
take
effect
it
is
evident
that
something
extraordinarily
interesting
is
going
to
take
place
as
they
are
all
so
active
one
of
them
goes
behind
the
door
and
fetches
out
a
little
cork
target
and
another
brings
out
of
his
bunk
a
box
of
darts
so
it
is
the
children
must
be
amused
the
target
is
hung
up
on
the
door
of
the
kitchen
leading
to
the
and
the
man
who
is
to
throw
first
takes
up
his
position
at
the
end
of
the
table
at
a
distance
of
three
yards
and
now
the
shooting
competition
begins
amid
laughter
and
noise
there
are
marksmen
of
all
kinds
good
bad
and
indifferent
here
comes
the
champion
one
can
see
that
by
the
determined
way
in
which
he
raises
the
dart
and
sends
it
flying
his
will
no
doubt
be
the
top
score
that
is
stubberud
of
the
five
darts
he
throws
two
are
in
the
and
three
close
to
it
the
next
is
johansen
he
is
not
bad
either
but
does
not
equal
the
other
score
then
comes
bjaaland
i
wonder
whether
he
is
as
smart
at
this
game
as
he
is
on
ski
he
places
himself
at
the
end
of
the
table
like
the
others
but
takes
a
stride
forward
he
is
a
leery
one
this
now
he
is
not
more
than
a
yard
and
a
half
from
the
target
he
throws
well
the
darts
describe
a
great
round
arch
this
is
what
is
known
as
throwing
with
a
high
trajectory
and
it
is
received
with
great
applause
the
trajectory
turns
out
to
be
too
high
and
all
his
darts
land
in
the
wall
above
the
door
hassel
throws
with
calculation
what
he
calculates
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
not
on
hitting
the
target
apparently
but
if
his
calculations
have
to
do
with
the
then
they
are
more
successful
whether
amundsen
calculates
or
not
makes
very
little
difference
his
are
all
misses
in
any
case
wisting
form
is
the
same
prestrud
is
about
between
the
good
shots
and
the
bad
hanssen
throws
like
a
professional
slinging
his
dart
with
great
force
he
evidently
thinks
he
is
hunting
walrus
all
the
scores
are
carefully
entered
in
a
book
and
prizes
will
be
given
later
on
meanwhile
lindstrom
is
playing
patience
his
day
work
is
now
done
but
besides
his
cards
he
is
much
interested
in
what
is
going
on
round
the
target
and
puts
in
a
good
word
here
and
there
then
he
gets
up
with
a
determined
look
he
has
one
more
duty
to
perform
this
consists
of
changing
the
light
from
the
big
lamp
under
the
ceiling
to
two
small
lamps
and
the
reason
for
the
change
is
that
the
heat
of
the
big
lamp
would
be
too
strongly
felt
in
the
upper
bunks
this
operation
is
a
gentle
hint
that
the
time
has
come
for
certain
people
to
turn
in
the
room
looks
dark
now
that
the
great
sun
under
the
ceiling
is
extinguished
the
two
lamps
that
are
now
alight
are
good
enough
but
one
seems
nevertheless
to
have
made
a
retrograde
step
towards
the
days
of
torches
by
degrees
then
the
vikings
began
to
retire
to
rest
my
description
of
the
day
life
at
framheim
would
be
incomplete
if
i
did
not
include
this
scene
in
it
lindstrom
chief
pride
i
had
been
told
was
that
he
was
always
the
first
man
in
bed
he
would
willingly
sacrifice
a
great
deal
to
hold
this
record
as
a
rule
he
had
no
difficulty
in
fulfilling
his
desire
as
nobody
tried
to
be
before
him
but
this
evening
it
was
otherwise
stubberud
was
far
advanced
with
his
undressing
when
lindstrom
came
in
and
seeing
a
chance
at
last
of
being
first
in
bed
at
once
challenged
the
cook
lindstrom
who
did
not
quite
grasp
the
situation
accepted
the
challenge
and
then
the
race
began
and
was
followed
by
the
others
with
great
excitement
now
stubberud
is
ready
and
is
just
going
to
jump
into
his
bunk
which
is
over
lindstrom
when
he
suddenly
feels
himself
clutched
by
the
leg
and
held
back
lindstrom
hangs
on
to
the
leg
with
all
his
force
crying
out
in
the
most
pitiable
voice
wait
a
bit
old
man
till
i
undressed
too
it
reminded
me
rather
of
the
man
who
was
going
to
fight
and
called
out
wait
till
i
get
a
hold
of
you
but
the
other
was
not
to
be
persuaded
he
was
determined
to
win
then
lindstrom
let
go
tore
off
his
braces
he
had
no
time
for
more
and
dived
head
first
into
his
bunk
stubberud
tried
to
protest
this
was
not
fair
he
was
not
undressed
and
so
on
that
does
matter
replied
the
fat
man
i
was
first
all
the
same
the
scene
was
followed
with
great
amusement
and
shouts
of
encouragement
and
ended
in
a
storm
of
applause
when
lindstrom
disappeared
into
his
bunk
with
his
clothes
on
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
the
business
for
his
leap
into
the
bunk
was
followed
by
a
fearful
crash
to
which
no
one
paid
any
attention
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
himself
least
of
all
but
now
the
consequences
appeared
the
shelf
along
the
side
of
his
bunk
on
which
he
kept
a
large
assortment
of
things
had
fallen
down
and
filled
the
bunk
with
rifles
ammunition
pipes
tins
of
tobacco
boxes
of
matches
and
there
was
no
room
left
for
the
man
himself
he
had
to
get
out
again
and
his
defeat
was
doubly
hard
with
shame
he
acknowledged
stubberud
as
the
victor
but
he
added
you
sha
be
first
another
time
one
by
one
the
others
turned
in
books
were
produced
here
and
there
a
pipe
as
well
and
in
this
way
the
last
hour
was
passed
at
eleven
precisely
the
lamps
were
put
out
and
the
day
was
at
an
end
soon
after
my
host
goes
to
the
door
and
i
follow
him
out
i
had
told
him
i
had
to
leave
again
this
evening
and
he
is
going
to
see
me
off
i
take
you
as
far
as
the
depot
he
says
the
rest
of
the
way
you
can
manage
by
yourself
the
weather
has
improved
considerably
but
it
is
dark
horribly
dark
so
that
we
may
find
the
way
more
easily
he
says
i
take
my
trio
if
they
do
see
the
way
they
smell
it
out
having
let
loose
the
three
dogs
who
evidently
wonder
what
the
meaning
of
it
may
be
he
puts
a
lantern
on
a
stack
of
timber
to
show
him
the
way
back
i
suppose
and
we
go
off
the
dogs
are
evidently
accustomed
to
go
this
way
for
they
set
off
at
once
in
the
direction
of
the
depot
yes
says
my
companion
it
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
know
the
way
they
have
gone
it
every
day
once
at
least
often
two
or
three
times
since
we
came
here
there
are
three
of
us
who
always
take
our
daily
walk
in
this
direction
bjaaland
stubberud
and
i
as
you
saw
this
morning
those
two
went
out
at
eight
they
did
that
so
as
to
be
back
to
work
at
nine
we
have
so
much
to
do
that
we
ca
afford
to
lose
any
time
so
they
take
their
walk
to
the
depot
and
back
at
nine
i
generally
do
the
same
the
others
began
the
winter
with
the
same
good
resolution
they
were
all
so
enthusiastic
for
a
morning
walk
but
the
enthusiasm
did
last
long
and
now
we
three
are
the
only
enthusiasts
left
but
short
as
the
way
is
about
yards
we
should
not
venture
to
go
without
those
marks
that
you
saw
and
without
our
dogs
i
have
often
hung
out
a
lantern
too
but
when
it
is
as
cold
as
this
evening
the
paraffin
freezes
and
the
light
goes
out
losing
one
way
here
might
be
a
very
serious
matter
and
i
do
want
to
run
the
risk
of
here
we
have
the
first
we
were
lucky
to
come
straight
upon
it
the
dogs
are
on
ahead
making
for
the
depot
another
reason
for
being
very
careful
on
the
way
to
the
depot
is
that
there
is
a
big
hole
feet
deep
just
by
a
hummock
on
that
slope
where
you
remember
the
last
flag
stands
if
one
missed
one
way
and
fell
into
it
one
might
get
hurt
we
passed
close
to
the
second
mark
the
next
two
marks
are
more
difficult
to
hit
off
they
are
so
low
and
i
often
wait
and
call
the
dogs
to
me
to
find
the
way
as
i
am
going
to
do
now
for
instance
it
is
impossible
to
see
anything
unless
you
come
right
on
it
so
we
must
wait
and
let
the
dogs
help
us
i
know
exactly
the
number
of
paces
between
each
mark
and
when
i
have
gone
that
number
i
stop
and
first
examine
the
ground
close
by
if
that
is
no
good
i
whistle
for
the
dogs
who
come
at
once
now
you
see
a
long
whistle
it
wo
be
long
before
they
are
here
i
can
hear
them
already
he
was
right
the
dogs
came
running
out
of
the
darkness
straight
towards
us
to
let
them
see
that
we
want
to
find
the
way
to
the
depot
we
must
begin
to
walk
on
we
did
so
as
soon
as
the
dogs
saw
this
they
went
forward
again
but
this
time
at
a
pace
that
allowed
us
to
keep
up
with
them
at
a
trot
and
soon
after
we
were
at
the
last
mark
as
you
see
my
lantern
over
at
the
camp
is
just
going
out
so
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
accompanying
you
farther
you
know
your
way
anyhow
with
these
words
we
parted
and
my
host
went
back
followed
by
the
faithful
trio
whilst
i
chapter
ix
the
end
of
the
winter
after
midwinter
day
the
time
began
to
pass
even
more
quickly
than
before
the
darkest
period
was
over
and
the
sun
was
daily
drawing
nearer
in
the
middle
of
the
darkest
time
hassel
came
in
one
morning
and
announced
that
else
had
eight
puppies
six
of
these
were
ladies
so
their
fate
was
sealed
at
once
they
were
killed
and
given
to
their
elder
relations
who
appreciated
them
highly
it
could
hardly
be
seen
that
they
chewed
them
at
all
they
went
down
practically
whole
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
their
approval
as
the
next
day
the
other
two
had
also
disappeared
the
weather
conditions
we
encountered
down
here
surprised
us
greatly
in
every
quarter
of
the
antarctic
regions
of
which
we
had
any
information
the
conditions
had
always
proved
very
unsettled
on
the
belgica
in
the
to
the
west
of
graham
land
we
always
had
rough
unpleasant
weather
nordenskjold
stay
in
the
regions
to
the
east
of
the
same
land
gave
the
same
report
storm
after
storm
the
whole
time
and
from
the
various
english
expeditions
that
have
visited
mcmurdo
sound
we
hear
of
continual
violent
winds
indeed
we
know
now
that
while
we
were
living
on
the
barrier
in
the
most
splendid
weather
calms
or
light
breezes
scott
at
his
station
some
four
hundred
miles
to
the
west
of
us
was
troubled
by
frequent
storms
which
greatly
hindered
his
work
i
had
expected
the
temperature
to
remain
high
as
throughout
the
winter
we
could
very
clearly
see
the
dark
sky
over
the
sea
whenever
the
state
of
the
air
was
favourable
the
dark
heavy
was
visible
in
a
marked
degree
leaving
no
doubt
that
a
large
extent
of
ross
sea
was
open
the
whole
year
round
nevertheless
the
temperature
went
very
low
and
without
doubt
the
mean
temperature
shown
by
our
observations
for
the
year
is
the
lowest
that
has
ever
been
recorded
our
lowest
temperature
on
august
was
for
five
months
of
the
year
we
were
able
to
record
temperatures
below
the
temperature
rose
with
every
wind
except
the
with
that
it
more
usually
went
down
we
observed
the
aurora
australis
many
times
but
only
a
few
of
its
appearances
were
specially
powerful
they
were
of
all
possible
forms
though
the
form
of
bands
seemed
to
be
commonest
most
of
the
aurorae
were
multicoloured
red
and
green
my
hypothesis
of
the
solidity
of
the
barrier
that
is
of
its
resting
upon
underlying
land
seems
to
be
confirmed
at
all
points
by
our
observations
during
our
twelve
months
stay
on
it
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
spring
the
is
forced
up
against
the
barrier
into
of
as
much
as
feet
in
height
this
took
place
only
about
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
our
hut
without
our
noticing
its
effect
in
the
slightest
degree
in
my
opinion
if
this
barrier
had
been
afloat
the
effect
of
the
violent
shock
which
took
place
at
its
edge
would
not
merely
have
been
noticeable
but
would
have
shaken
our
house
while
building
the
house
stubberud
and
bjaaland
heard
a
loud
noise
a
long
way
off
but
could
feel
nothing
during
our
whole
stay
we
never
heard
a
sound
or
felt
a
movement
on
this
spot
another
very
good
proof
seems
to
be
afforded
by
the
large
theodolite
that
prestrud
used
it
would
take
next
to
nothing
to
disturb
its
level
a
slight
change
of
temperature
might
be
enough
so
delicate
an
instrument
would
have
soon
shown
an
inclination
if
the
barrier
had
been
afloat
the
day
we
entered
the
bay
for
the
first
time
a
small
piece
of
its
western
cape
broke
away
during
the
spring
the
pressed
in
an
insignificant
part
of
one
of
the
many
points
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
barrier
with
these
exceptions
we
left
the
barrier
as
we
found
it
entirely
unaltered
the
soundings
which
showed
a
rapid
rise
in
the
bottom
as
the
fram
changed
her
position
southward
along
the
barrier
are
also
a
clear
sign
that
land
is
close
at
hand
finally
the
formations
of
the
barrier
appear
to
be
the
best
proof
it
could
not
rise
to
feet
which
we
measured
as
the
rise
from
framheim
to
a
point
about
miles
to
the
south
without
subjacent
land
work
now
proceeded
on
the
sledging
outfit
with
feverish
haste
we
had
for
a
long
time
been
aware
that
we
should
have
to
do
our
utmost
and
make
the
best
use
of
our
time
if
we
were
to
have
the
general
outfit
for
our
common
use
ready
by
the
middle
of
august
for
preparing
our
personal
outfit
we
had
to
use
our
leisure
time
by
the
first
half
of
august
we
could
begin
to
see
the
end
of
our
labour
bjaaland
had
now
finished
the
four
sledges
it
was
a
masterly
piece
of
work
that
he
had
carried
out
in
the
course
of
the
winter
they
were
extremely
lightly
constructed
but
very
strong
they
were
of
the
same
length
as
the
original
sledges
about
feet
and
were
not
shod
we
should
have
a
couple
of
the
old
fram
sledges
with
us
and
these
were
shod
with
strong
steel
plates
so
that
they
could
be
used
if
the
surface
and
going
rendered
it
necessary
the
average
weight
of
the
new
sledges
was
pounds
we
had
thus
saved
as
much
as
pounds
per
sledge
when
bjaaland
had
finished
them
they
were
taken
into
the
clothing
store
the
way
in
which
hanssen
and
wisting
lashed
the
various
parts
together
was
a
guarantee
of
their
soundness
in
fact
the
only
way
in
which
one
can
expect
work
to
be
properly
and
carefully
carried
out
is
to
have
it
done
by
the
very
men
who
are
to
use
the
things
they
know
what
is
at
stake
they
do
it
so
that
they
may
reach
their
destination
more
than
that
they
do
it
so
that
they
may
come
back
again
every
piece
of
binding
is
first
carefully
examined
and
tested
then
it
is
put
on
cautiously
and
accurately
every
turn
is
hauled
taut
taking
care
that
it
is
in
its
right
place
and
finally
the
lashing
is
pointed
in
such
a
way
that
one
would
do
best
to
use
a
knife
or
an
axe
if
it
has
to
be
undone
again
there
is
no
danger
of
jerking
it
out
with
the
fingers
a
sledge
journey
of
the
kind
we
had
before
us
is
a
serious
undertaking
and
the
work
has
to
be
done
seriously
it
was
no
warm
and
comfortable
workshop
that
they
had
for
doing
this
the
clothing
store
was
always
the
coldest
place
probably
because
there
was
always
a
draught
through
it
there
was
a
door
out
on
to
the
barrier
and
an
open
passage
leading
to
the
house
fresh
air
was
constantly
passing
through
though
not
in
any
very
great
quantity
but
it
does
not
take
much
to
make
itself
felt
when
the
air
is
at
a
temperature
of
about
and
when
one
is
working
with
bare
fingers
there
were
always
some
degrees
of
frost
here
in
order
to
keep
the
lashings
pliable
while
they
were
being
put
on
they
used
a
primus
lamp
on
a
stone
close
to
where
they
were
working
i
often
admired
their
patience
when
i
stood
watching
them
i
have
seen
them
more
than
once
working
barehanded
by
the
hour
together
in
a
temperature
of
about
this
may
pass
for
a
short
time
but
through
the
coldest
and
darkest
part
of
the
winter
working
day
after
day
as
they
did
it
is
pretty
severe
and
a
great
trial
of
patience
nor
were
their
feet
very
well
off
either
it
makes
hardly
any
difference
what
one
puts
on
them
if
one
has
to
stay
still
here
as
elsewhere
in
the
cold
it
was
found
that
boots
with
wooden
soles
were
the
best
for
sedentary
work
but
for
some
reason
or
other
the
occupants
of
the
clothing
store
would
not
give
their
adherence
to
the
principle
and
continued
to
work
all
through
the
winter
in
their
and
sealskin
boots
they
preferred
stamping
their
feet
to
acknowledging
the
incontestable
superiority
of
wooden
soles
in
such
conditions
as
the
sledges
were
finished
they
were
numbered
from
one
to
seven
and
stored
in
the
clothing
department
the
three
old
sledges
we
should
have
to
use
were
made
for
the
fram
second
expedition
they
were
extremely
strong
and
of
course
heavier
than
the
new
ones
they
were
all
carefully
overhauled
all
the
bindings
and
lashings
were
examined
and
replaced
wherever
necessary
the
steel
shoes
were
taken
off
one
but
retained
on
the
other
two
in
case
we
should
meet
with
conditions
where
they
would
be
required
in
addition
to
this
work
of
lashing
these
two
had
plenty
of
other
occupation
whenever
wisting
was
not
taken
up
by
the
work
on
the
sledges
one
could
hear
the
hum
of
his
he
had
a
thousand
different
things
to
do
in
his
and
was
in
there
nearly
every
day
till
late
in
the
evening
it
was
only
when
the
target
and
darts
came
out
at
eight
that
he
showed
himself
and
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
had
undertaken
the
position
of
marker
at
these
competitions
we
should
hardly
have
seen
him
even
then
his
first
important
piece
of
work
was
making
four
tents
into
two
it
was
not
easy
to
manage
these
rather
large
tents
in
the
little
hole
that
went
by
the
name
of
the
of
course
he
used
the
table
in
the
clothing
store
for
cutting
out
but
all
the
same
it
is
a
mystery
how
he
contrived
to
get
hold
of
the
right
seams
when
he
sat
in
his
hole
i
was
prepared
to
see
the
most
tents
when
once
they
were
brought
out
and
set
up
in
daylight
one
might
imagine
that
the
floor
of
one
would
be
sewed
on
to
the
side
of
another
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
when
the
tents
were
brought
out
for
the
first
time
and
set
up
they
proved
to
be
perfect
one
would
have
thought
they
had
been
made
in
a
big
instead
of
in
a
fellows
like
this
are
priceless
on
such
an
expedition
as
ours
on
the
second
fram
expedition
they
used
double
tents
and
as
of
course
nothing
is
so
good
and
serviceable
as
the
thing
one
has
not
got
the
praises
of
double
tents
were
now
sung
in
every
key
well
i
naturally
had
to
admit
that
a
house
with
double
walls
is
warmer
than
one
with
single
walls
but
at
the
same
time
one
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
house
is
also
twice
as
heavy
and
when
one
has
to
consider
the
weight
of
a
it
will
be
understood
that
the
question
of
the
real
advantages
of
the
house
had
to
be
thoroughly
considered
before
taking
the
step
of
committing
oneself
to
it
i
had
thought
that
with
double
walls
one
would
possibly
avoid
some
of
the
rime
that
is
generally
so
troublesome
in
the
tents
and
often
becomes
a
serious
matter
if
then
the
double
walls
would
in
any
way
prevent
or
improve
this
condition
of
things
i
could
see
the
advantage
of
having
them
for
the
increased
weight
caused
by
the
daily
deposit
of
rime
would
in
a
short
time
be
equal
to
if
not
greater
than
the
additional
weight
of
the
double
tent
these
double
tents
are
made
so
that
the
outer
tent
is
fast
and
the
inner
loose
in
the
course
of
our
discussion
it
appeared
that
the
deposit
of
rime
occurred
just
as
quickly
on
a
double
tent
as
on
a
single
one
and
thus
the
utility
of
the
double
tent
appeared
to
me
to
be
rather
doubtful
if
the
object
was
merely
to
have
it
a
few
degrees
warmer
in
the
tent
i
thought
it
best
to
sacrifice
this
comfort
to
the
weight
we
should
thereby
save
moreover
we
were
so
plentifully
supplied
with
warm
sleeping
things
that
we
should
not
have
to
suffer
any
hardship
but
another
question
cropped
up
as
a
result
of
this
discussion
the
question
of
what
was
the
most
useful
colour
for
a
tent
we
were
soon
agreed
that
a
tent
was
best
for
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
as
a
relief
to
the
eyes
we
knew
well
enough
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
to
come
into
a
dark
tent
after
travelling
all
day
on
the
glistening
barrier
surface
in
the
next
place
the
dark
colour
would
make
the
tent
a
good
deal
warmer
when
the
sun
was
up
another
important
consideration
one
may
easily
prove
this
by
walking
in
dark
clothes
in
a
hot
sun
and
afterwards
changing
to
white
ones
and
finally
a
dark
tent
would
be
far
easier
to
see
on
the
white
surface
than
a
light
one
when
all
these
questions
had
been
discussed
and
the
superiority
of
a
dark
tent
admitted
we
were
doubly
keen
on
it
since
all
our
tents
happened
to
be
light
not
to
say
white
and
the
possibility
of
getting
dark
ones
was
not
very
apparent
it
is
true
that
we
had
a
few
yards
of
darkish
gabardine
or
light
windproof
material
which
would
have
been
extremely
suitable
for
this
purpose
but
every
yard
of
it
had
long
ago
been
destined
for
some
other
use
so
that
did
not
get
us
out
of
the
difficulty
but
said
somebody
and
he
had
a
very
cunning
air
as
he
uttered
that
but
but
we
got
ink
and
that
we
can
dye
our
tents
dark
with
yes
of
course
we
all
smiled
indulgently
the
thing
was
so
plain
that
it
was
almost
silly
to
mention
it
but
all
the
same
the
man
was
forgiven
his
silliness
and
were
established
wisting
accepted
the
position
of
dyer
in
addition
to
his
other
duties
and
succeeded
so
well
that
before
very
long
we
had
two
dark
blue
tents
instead
of
the
white
ones
these
looked
very
well
no
doubt
freshly
dyed
as
they
were
but
the
question
was
what
would
they
look
like
after
a
couple
of
months
use
the
general
opinion
was
that
they
would
probably
to
a
great
extent
have
reverted
to
their
original
colour
or
lack
of
colour
some
better
patent
had
to
be
invented
as
we
were
sitting
over
our
coffee
after
dinner
one
day
someone
suddenly
suggested
but
look
here
suppose
we
took
our
bunk
curtains
and
made
an
outer
tent
of
them
this
time
the
smile
that
passed
over
the
company
as
they
put
down
their
cups
was
almost
compassionate
nothing
was
said
but
the
silence
meant
something
like
poor
chap
as
if
we
had
all
thought
of
that
long
ago
the
proposal
was
adopted
without
discussion
and
wisting
had
another
long
job
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
our
were
dark
red
and
made
of
very
light
material
they
were
sewed
together
curtain
to
curtain
and
finally
the
whole
was
made
into
an
outer
tent
the
curtains
only
sufficed
for
one
tent
but
remembering
that
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
we
had
to
be
satisfied
with
this
the
red
tent
which
was
set
up
a
few
days
after
met
with
unqualified
approval
it
would
be
visible
some
miles
away
in
the
snow
another
important
advantage
was
that
it
would
protect
and
preserve
the
main
tent
inside
the
effect
of
the
combination
of
red
and
blue
was
to
give
an
agreeably
dark
shade
another
question
was
how
to
protect
the
tent
from
a
hundred
loose
dogs
who
were
no
better
behaved
than
others
of
their
kind
if
the
tent
became
stiff
and
brittle
it
might
be
spoilt
in
a
very
short
time
and
the
demands
we
made
on
our
tents
were
considerable
we
expected
them
to
last
at
least
days
i
therefore
got
wisting
to
make
two
or
guards
these
guards
consisted
simply
of
a
piece
of
gabardine
long
enough
to
stretch
all
round
the
tent
and
to
act
as
a
fence
in
preventing
the
dogs
from
coming
in
direct
contact
with
the
tents
the
guards
were
made
with
loops
so
that
they
could
be
stretched
upon
they
looked
very
fine
when
they
were
finished
but
they
never
came
to
be
used
for
as
soon
as
we
began
the
journey
we
found
a
material
that
was
even
more
suitable
and
always
to
be
had
snow
idiots
of
course
we
all
knew
that
only
we
would
say
so
well
that
was
one
against
us
however
the
guards
came
in
well
as
reserve
material
on
the
trip
and
many
were
the
uses
they
were
put
to
in
the
next
place
wisting
had
to
make
for
every
man
that
we
had
brought
out
proved
to
be
too
small
but
the
things
he
made
were
big
enough
there
was
easily
room
for
two
more
in
my
trousers
but
they
have
to
be
so
in
these
regions
one
soon
finds
out
that
everything
that
is
roomy
is
warm
and
comfortable
while
everything
that
is
tight
of
course
excepted
is
warm
and
uncomfortable
one
quickly
gets
into
a
perspiration
and
spoils
the
clothes
besides
the
breeches
and
anorak
of
light
he
made
stockings
of
the
same
material
i
assumed
that
these
stockings
worn
among
the
other
stockings
we
had
on
would
have
an
insulating
effect
opinions
were
greatly
divided
on
this
point
but
i
must
confess
in
common
with
my
four
companions
on
the
polar
journey
that
i
would
never
make
a
serious
trip
without
them
they
fulfilled
all
our
expectations
the
rime
was
deposited
on
them
freely
and
was
easily
brushed
off
if
they
got
wet
it
was
easy
to
dry
them
in
almost
all
weathers
i
know
of
no
material
that
dries
so
quickly
as
this
windproof
stuff
another
thing
was
that
they
protected
the
other
stockings
against
tears
and
made
them
last
much
longer
than
would
otherwise
have
been
the
case
as
evidence
of
how
pleased
we
who
took
part
in
the
long
sledge
journey
were
with
these
stockings
i
may
mention
that
when
we
reached
the
depot
in
on
the
homeward
trip
be
it
noted
that
is
when
we
looked
upon
the
journey
as
over
we
found
there
some
bags
with
various
articles
of
clothing
in
one
of
these
were
two
pairs
of
windproof
stockings
the
bag
presumably
belonged
to
an
opponent
of
the
idea
and
it
may
be
imagined
that
there
was
some
fun
we
all
wanted
them
all
without
exception
the
two
lucky
ones
each
seized
his
pair
and
hid
it
as
if
it
was
the
most
costly
treasure
what
they
wanted
with
them
i
can
not
guess
as
we
were
at
home
but
this
example
shows
how
we
had
learnt
to
appreciate
them
i
recommend
them
most
warmly
to
men
who
are
undertaking
similar
expeditions
but
i
must
add
they
must
give
themselves
the
trouble
of
taking
off
their
every
evening
and
brushing
the
rime
off
their
stockings
if
one
does
not
do
this
of
course
the
rime
will
thaw
in
the
course
of
the
night
and
everything
will
be
soaking
wet
in
the
morning
in
that
case
you
must
not
blame
the
stockings
but
yourself
after
this
it
was
the
turn
of
the
underclothing
there
was
nothing
in
the
tailoring
and
outfitting
department
that
wisting
could
not
manage
among
our
medical
stores
we
had
two
large
rolls
of
the
most
beautiful
fine
light
flannel
and
of
this
he
made
underclothing
for
all
of
us
what
we
had
brought
out
from
home
was
made
of
extremely
thick
woollen
material
and
we
were
afraid
this
would
be
too
warm
personally
i
wore
wisting
make
the
whole
trip
and
have
never
known
anything
so
perfect
then
he
had
covers
for
the
to
sew
and
patch
and
one
thing
and
another
some
people
give
one
the
impression
of
being
able
to
make
anything
and
to
get
it
done
in
no
time
others
not
hanssen
had
his
days
well
occupied
industrious
and
handy
as
he
was
he
was
an
expert
at
anything
relating
to
sledges
and
knew
exactly
what
had
to
be
done
whatever
he
had
a
hand
in
i
could
feel
sure
of
he
never
left
anything
to
chance
besides
lashing
the
sledges
he
had
a
number
of
other
things
to
do
amongst
them
he
was
to
prepare
all
the
whips
we
required
two
for
each
driver
or
fourteen
altogether
stubberud
was
to
supply
the
handles
in
consultation
with
the
carpenters
union
i
had
chosen
a
handle
made
of
three
narrow
strips
of
hickory
i
assumed
that
if
these
were
securely
lashed
together
and
the
lashings
covered
with
leather
they
would
make
as
strong
a
handle
as
one
could
expect
to
get
the
idea
of
the
composite
handle
of
three
pieces
of
wood
was
that
it
would
give
and
bend
instead
of
breaking
we
knew
by
experience
that
a
solid
did
not
last
very
long
it
was
arranged
then
that
the
handles
were
to
be
made
by
stubberud
and
passed
on
to
hanssen
the
were
made
by
hassel
in
the
course
of
the
winter
on
the
eskimo
model
they
were
round
and
heavy
as
they
should
be
and
dangerous
to
come
near
when
they
were
wielded
by
an
experienced
hand
hanssen
received
these
different
parts
to
join
them
together
and
make
the
whip
as
usual
this
was
done
with
all
possible
care
three
strong
lashings
were
put
on
each
handle
and
these
again
were
covered
with
leather
personally
hanssen
was
not
in
favour
of
the
triple
hickory
handle
but
he
did
the
work
without
raising
any
objection
we
all
remarked
it
is
true
that
at
this
time
contrary
to
his
habit
he
spent
the
hours
after
supper
with
wisting
i
wondered
a
little
at
this
as
i
knew
hanssen
was
very
fond
of
a
game
of
whist
after
supper
and
never
missed
it
unless
he
had
work
to
do
i
happened
one
evening
to
express
my
surprise
at
this
and
stubberud
answered
at
once
he
making
handles
what
sort
of
handles
but
stubberud
added
i
guarantee
those
hickory
handles
making
you
ca
have
anything
tougher
and
stronger
than
those
he
was
rather
sore
about
it
that
was
easy
to
see
the
idea
was
his
own
too
then
talk
of
the
devil
in
walked
hanssen
with
a
fine
big
whip
in
his
hand
i
of
course
appeared
extremely
surprised
what
i
said
more
whips
yes
said
he
i
do
believe
in
those
i
making
in
the
daytime
but
here
a
whip
that
i
can
trust
i
must
admit
that
it
looked
well
the
whole
handle
was
covered
so
that
one
could
not
see
what
it
was
made
of
but
i
ventured
to
object
are
you
sure
it
is
as
strong
as
the
others
oh
as
to
that
he
answered
i
quite
ready
to
back
it
against
any
of
those
he
did
not
say
the
word
nor
was
there
any
need
his
meaning
was
unmistakable
and
rotten
whips
sounded
in
our
ears
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
shouted
it
i
had
no
time
to
observe
the
effect
of
this
terrible
utterance
for
a
determined
voice
called
out
we
see
about
that
i
turned
round
and
there
was
stubberud
leaning
against
the
end
of
the
table
evidently
hurt
by
hanssen
words
which
he
took
as
a
personal
affront
if
you
dare
risk
your
whip
come
on
he
had
taken
down
one
of
the
insulted
whips
from
the
shelf
in
his
bunk
and
stood
in
a
fighting
attitude
this
promised
well
we
all
looked
at
hanssen
he
had
gone
too
far
to
be
able
to
draw
back
he
had
to
fight
he
took
his
weapon
in
his
hand
and
entered
the
ring
the
conditions
were
arranged
and
accepted
by
both
parties
they
were
to
fight
until
one
of
the
handles
was
broken
and
then
the
whip
duel
began
the
opponents
were
very
serious
over
it
one
two
three
the
first
blow
fell
handle
against
handle
the
combatants
had
shut
their
eyes
and
awaited
the
result
when
they
opened
them
again
they
shone
with
happy
surprise
both
handles
were
as
whole
as
before
now
each
of
them
was
really
delighted
with
his
own
handle
and
the
blows
fell
faster
stubberud
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
table
got
so
excited
over
the
unexpected
result
that
every
time
he
raised
his
weapon
he
gave
the
edge
of
the
table
a
resounding
smack
without
knowing
it
how
many
rounds
had
been
fought
i
do
not
know
when
i
heard
a
crack
followed
by
the
words
there
you
can
see
old
man
as
stubberud
left
the
ring
i
was
able
to
see
hanssen
he
stood
on
the
eyeing
his
whip
it
looked
like
a
broken
lily
the
spectators
had
not
been
silent
they
had
followed
the
fight
with
excitement
amid
laughter
and
shouts
that
right
stubberud
do
give
in
bravo
hanssen
that
a
good
one
the
whips
afterwards
turned
out
remarkably
well
not
that
they
lasted
out
the
trip
but
they
held
together
for
a
long
while
are
a
very
perishable
commodity
if
one
used
nothing
but
the
lash
they
would
be
everlasting
but
as
a
rule
one
is
not
long
satisfied
with
that
it
is
when
one
gives
a
confirmation
as
we
call
it
that
the
handle
breaks
a
confirmation
is
generally
held
when
some
sinner
or
other
has
gone
wrong
and
refuses
to
obey
it
consists
in
taking
the
first
opportunity
when
the
sledge
stops
of
going
in
among
the
dogs
taking
out
the
defiant
one
and
laying
into
him
with
the
handle
these
confirmations
if
they
occur
frequently
may
use
up
a
lot
of
handles
it
was
also
arranged
that
hanssen
should
prepare
goggles
in
the
eskimo
fashion
and
he
began
this
work
but
it
soon
appeared
that
everyone
had
some
patent
of
his
own
which
was
much
better
therefore
it
was
given
up
and
every
man
made
his
own
goggles
stubberud
chief
work
was
making
the
sledge
cases
lighter
and
he
succeeded
in
doing
this
but
not
without
hard
work
it
took
far
longer
than
one
would
have
thought
the
wood
had
a
good
many
knots
and
he
often
had
to
work
against
the
grain
the
planing
was
therefore
rather
difficult
and
slow
he
planed
a
good
deal
off
them
but
could
guarantee
them
as
he
said
their
sides
were
not
many
millimetres
thick
to
strengthen
them
in
the
joints
corners
of
aluminium
were
put
on
in
addition
to
remaking
the
sledges
bjaaland
had
to
get
the
ski
ready
to
fit
the
big
broad
boots
we
should
wear
the
huitfeldt
fittings
had
to
be
much
broader
than
usual
and
we
had
such
with
us
so
that
bjaaland
had
only
to
change
them
the
were
like
the
everyone
had
his
own
patent
i
found
the
bindings
that
bjaaland
had
put
on
for
himself
so
efficient
that
i
had
no
hesitation
in
ordering
similar
ones
for
myself
and
it
may
be
said
to
their
honour
and
to
the
honour
of
him
who
made
them
that
they
were
and
served
me
well
during
the
whole
trip
they
were
after
all
only
a
retention
of
the
old
system
but
with
the
help
of
hooks
and
eyes
they
could
be
put
on
and
taken
off
in
an
instant
and
those
were
the
conditions
we
demanded
of
our
bindings
that
they
should
hold
the
foot
as
firmly
as
a
vice
and
should
be
easy
to
hook
on
and
take
off
for
we
always
had
to
take
them
off
on
the
journey
if
one
left
one
bindings
out
for
a
night
they
were
gone
in
the
morning
the
dogs
looked
upon
them
as
a
delicacy
the
also
had
to
be
removed
in
the
evening
in
other
words
the
ski
had
to
be
left
absolutely
bare
johansen
besides
his
packing
was
occupied
in
making
weights
and
the
weights
were
very
ingeniously
made
the
steelyard
system
was
adopted
if
they
were
never
used
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
weights
they
were
good
enough
but
the
reason
was
that
we
had
all
our
provisions
so
arranged
that
they
could
be
taken
without
being
weighed
we
were
all
weighed
on
august
and
it
then
appeared
that
lindstrom
was
the
heaviest
with
lbs
on
that
occasion
he
was
officially
christened
fatty
the
johansen
made
were
the
opposite
of
what
such
pegs
usually
are
in
other
words
they
were
flat
instead
of
being
high
we
saw
the
advantage
at
once
besides
being
so
much
lighter
they
were
many
times
stronger
i
do
not
know
that
we
ever
broke
a
peg
on
the
trip
possibly
we
lost
one
or
two
most
of
them
were
brought
home
undamaged
hassel
worked
at
his
down
in
the
petroleum
store
it
was
an
uncomfortable
place
for
him
always
cold
but
he
had
the
lashes
ready
by
the
time
he
had
promised
them
prestrud
made
charts
and
copied
out
tables
six
of
us
were
to
have
these
copies
in
each
sledge
there
was
a
combined
provision
and
observation
book
bearing
the
same
number
as
the
sledge
it
contained
first
an
exact
list
of
the
provisions
contained
in
each
case
on
that
sledge
and
in
addition
the
necessary
tables
for
our
astronomical
observations
in
these
books
each
man
kept
a
daily
account
of
every
scrap
of
provisions
he
took
out
in
this
way
we
could
always
check
the
contents
of
the
cases
and
know
what
quantity
of
provisions
we
had
farther
on
in
the
book
the
observations
were
entered
and
the
distance
covered
for
the
day
course
and
so
on
that
is
a
rough
outline
of
what
we
were
doing
in
the
course
of
the
winter
in
working
hours
besides
this
there
were
of
course
a
hundred
things
that
every
man
had
to
do
for
his
personal
equipment
during
the
winter
each
man
had
his
outfit
served
out
to
him
so
that
he
might
have
time
to
make
whatever
alterations
he
found
necessary
every
man
received
a
heavy
and
a
lighter
suit
of
as
well
as
mits
and
stockings
he
also
had
dogskin
stockings
and
sealskin
kamiks
in
addition
there
was
a
complete
outfit
of
underclothing
and
all
were
served
alike
there
was
no
priority
at
all
the
skin
clothing
was
the
first
to
be
tackled
and
here
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
done
as
nothing
had
been
made
to
measure
one
man
found
that
the
hood
of
his
anorak
came
too
far
down
over
his
eyes
another
that
it
did
not
come
down
far
enough
so
both
had
to
set
to
work
at
alterations
one
cutting
off
the
other
adding
a
piece
one
found
his
trousers
too
long
another
too
short
and
they
had
to
alter
those
however
they
managed
it
the
needle
was
always
at
work
either
for
sewing
a
piece
on
or
for
hemming
the
shortened
piece
although
we
began
this
work
in
good
time
it
looked
as
if
we
should
never
have
finished
the
room
orderly
had
to
sweep
out
huge
piles
of
strips
and
every
morning
but
the
next
morning
there
were
just
as
many
if
we
had
stayed
there
i
am
sure
we
should
still
be
sitting
and
sewing
away
at
our
outfit
a
number
of
patents
were
invented
of
course
the
everlasting
mask
for
the
face
was
to
the
fore
and
took
the
form
of
i
too
allowed
myself
to
be
beguiled
into
experimenting
with
good
reason
as
i
thought
but
with
extremely
poor
results
i
had
hit
upon
something
which
of
course
i
thought
much
better
than
anything
that
had
been
previously
tried
the
day
i
put
on
my
invention
i
not
only
got
my
nose
frozen
but
my
forehead
and
cheek
as
well
i
never
tried
it
again
hassel
was
great
at
new
inventions
he
wore
all
over
him
these
patents
are
very
good
things
for
passing
the
time
when
one
actually
takes
the
field
they
all
vanish
they
are
useless
for
serious
work
the
were
also
a
great
source
of
interest
johansen
was
at
work
on
the
double
one
he
was
so
keen
on
heaven
knows
how
many
skins
he
put
into
it
i
do
nor
did
i
ever
try
to
find
out
bjaaland
was
also
in
full
swing
with
alterations
to
his
he
found
the
opening
at
the
top
inconvenient
and
preferred
to
have
it
in
the
middle
his
arrangement
of
a
flap
with
buttons
and
loops
made
it
easy
to
mistake
him
for
a
colonel
of
dragoons
when
he
was
in
bed
he
was
tremendously
pleased
with
it
but
so
he
was
with
his
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
could
not
see
with
them
and
that
they
allowed
him
to
become
the
rest
of
us
kept
our
as
they
were
only
lengthening
or
shortening
them
as
required
we
were
all
greatly
pleased
with
the
device
for
closing
them
on
the
plan
of
a
sack
outside
our
bags
we
had
a
cover
of
very
thin
canvas
this
was
extremely
useful
and
i
would
not
be
without
it
for
anything
in
the
daytime
the
was
always
well
protected
by
this
cover
no
snow
could
get
in
at
night
it
was
perhaps
even
more
useful
as
it
protected
the
bag
from
the
moisture
of
the
breath
instead
of
condensing
on
the
skin
and
making
it
wet
this
settled
on
the
cover
forming
in
the
course
of
the
night
a
film
of
ice
which
disappeared
again
during
the
day
breaking
off
while
the
bag
ay
stretched
on
the
sledge
this
cover
ought
to
be
of
ample
size
it
is
important
that
it
should
be
rather
longer
than
the
so
that
one
may
have
plenty
of
it
round
the
neck
and
thus
prevent
the
breath
from
penetrating
into
the
bag
we
all
had
double
bags
an
inner
and
an
outer
one
the
inner
one
was
of
or
thin
female
and
quite
light
the
outer
one
was
of
heavy
buck
and
weighed
about
pounds
both
were
open
at
the
end
like
a
sack
and
were
laced
together
round
the
neck
i
have
always
found
this
pattern
the
easiest
simplest
most
comfortable
and
best
we
recommend
it
to
all
novelties
in
the
way
of
were
many
this
was
of
course
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
and
required
study
it
was
studied
too
the
particular
problem
was
to
find
good
goggles
without
glass
it
is
true
that
i
had
worn
nothing
but
a
pair
of
ordinary
spectacles
with
light
yellow
glasses
all
the
autumn
and
that
they
had
proved
excellent
but
for
the
long
journey
i
was
afraid
these
would
give
insufficient
protection
i
therefore
threw
myself
into
the
competition
for
the
best
patent
the
end
of
it
was
that
we
all
went
in
for
leather
goggles
with
a
little
slit
for
the
eyes
the
bjaaland
patent
won
the
prize
and
was
most
adopted
hassel
had
his
own
invention
combined
with
a
when
spread
out
it
reminded
me
of
the
american
eagle
i
never
saw
him
use
it
nor
did
any
of
us
use
these
new
goggles
except
bjaaland
he
used
his
own
goggles
the
whole
way
but
then
he
was
the
only
one
who
became
the
spectacles
i
wore
hanssen
had
the
same
they
were
the
only
two
pairs
we
had
gave
perfect
protection
not
once
did
i
have
a
sign
of
they
were
exactly
like
other
spectacles
without
any
gauze
at
all
round
the
glasses
the
light
could
penetrate
everywhere
schanz
of
dresden
who
sent
me
these
glasses
has
every
right
to
be
satisfied
with
his
invention
its
beats
anything
i
have
ever
tried
or
seen
the
next
great
question
was
our
boots
i
had
expressly
pointed
out
that
boots
must
be
taken
whether
the
person
concerned
intended
to
wear
them
or
not
for
boots
were
indispensable
in
case
of
having
to
cross
any
glacier
which
was
a
contingency
we
had
to
reckon
with
from
the
descriptions
we
had
read
of
the
country
with
this
proviso
everyone
might
do
as
he
pleased
and
all
began
by
improving
their
boots
in
accordance
with
our
previous
experience
the
improvement
consisted
in
making
them
larger
wisting
took
mine
in
hand
again
and
began
once
more
to
pull
them
to
pieces
it
is
only
by
tearing
a
thing
to
pieces
that
one
can
see
what
the
work
is
like
we
gained
a
good
insight
into
the
way
our
boots
had
been
made
stronger
or
more
conscientious
work
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
it
was
hard
work
pulling
them
to
pieces
this
time
mine
lost
a
couple
more
soles
how
many
that
made
altogether
i
do
not
remember
but
now
i
got
what
i
had
always
called
for
room
enough
besides
being
able
to
wear
all
the
i
had
i
could
also
find
room
for
a
wooden
sole
that
made
me
happy
my
great
object
was
achieved
now
the
temperature
could
be
as
low
as
it
liked
it
would
not
get
through
the
wooden
soles
and
my
various
stockings
seven
pairs
i
think
in
all
i
was
pleased
that
evening
as
the
struggle
had
been
a
long
one
it
had
taken
me
nearly
two
years
to
arrive
at
this
result
and
then
there
was
the
which
we
must
all
have
in
order
the
experience
of
the
last
depot
journey
when
two
dogs
fell
into
a
crevasse
through
faulty
harness
must
not
be
allowed
to
repeat
itself
we
therefore
devoted
great
care
and
attention
to
this
gear
and
used
all
the
best
materials
we
had
the
result
rewarded
our
pains
we
had
good
strong
harness
for
every
team
this
description
will
perhaps
open
the
eyes
of
some
people
and
show
them
that
the
equipment
of
an
expedition
such
as
we
were
about
to
enter
upon
is
not
the
affair
of
a
day
it
is
not
money
alone
that
makes
for
the
success
of
such
an
expedition
though
heaven
knows
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
but
it
is
in
a
great
measure
indeed
i
may
say
that
this
is
the
greatest
factor
the
way
in
which
the
expedition
is
equipped
the
way
in
which
every
difficulty
is
foreseen
and
precautions
taken
for
meeting
or
avoiding
it
victory
awaits
him
who
has
everything
in
order
luck
people
call
it
defeat
is
certain
for
him
who
has
neglected
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
in
time
this
is
called
bad
luck
but
pray
do
not
think
this
is
an
epitaph
i
wish
to
have
inscribed
on
my
own
tomb
no
honour
where
honour
is
due
honour
to
my
faithful
comrades
who
by
their
patience
perseverance
and
experience
brought
our
equipment
to
the
limit
of
perfection
and
thereby
rendered
our
victory
possible
on
august
we
began
to
pack
our
sledges
two
were
placed
in
the
crystal
palace
and
two
in
the
clothing
store
it
was
a
great
advantage
to
be
able
to
do
this
work
under
cover
at
this
time
the
temperature
was
dancing
a
cancan
between
and
with
an
occasional
refreshing
breeze
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
miles
an
hour
it
would
have
been
almost
an
impossibility
to
pack
the
sledges
out
of
doors
under
these
conditions
if
it
was
to
be
done
carefully
and
firmly
and
of
course
it
had
to
be
so
done
our
fixed
lashings
had
to
be
laced
together
with
lengths
of
thin
rope
and
this
took
time
but
when
properly
done
as
it
was
now
the
cases
were
held
as
though
in
a
vice
and
could
not
move
the
zinc
plates
we
had
had
under
the
sledges
to
keep
them
up
in
loose
snow
had
been
taken
off
we
could
not
see
that
we
should
have
any
use
for
them
in
their
place
we
had
lashed
a
spare
ski
under
each
sledge
and
these
were
very
useful
later
by
august
all
the
sledges
were
ready
waiting
to
be
driven
away
the
dogs
did
not
like
the
cold
weather
we
had
now
had
for
so
long
when
the
temperature
went
down
between
and
one
could
see
by
their
movements
that
they
felt
it
they
stood
still
and
raised
their
feet
from
the
ground
in
turn
holding
each
foot
up
for
a
while
before
putting
it
down
again
on
the
cold
surface
they
were
cunning
and
resourceful
in
the
extreme
they
did
not
care
very
much
for
fish
and
some
of
them
were
difficult
to
get
into
the
tents
on
the
evenings
when
they
knew
there
was
fish
stubberud
especially
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
one
of
the
young
dogs
funcho
was
his
name
he
was
born
at
madeira
during
our
stay
there
in
september
on
meat
evenings
each
man
after
fastening
up
his
dogs
went
as
has
been
described
up
to
the
wall
of
the
and
took
his
box
of
meat
which
was
put
out
there
funcho
used
to
watch
for
this
moment
when
he
saw
stubberud
take
the
box
he
knew
there
was
meat
and
then
he
came
quietly
into
the
tent
as
though
there
was
nothing
the
matter
if
on
the
other
hand
stubberud
showed
no
sign
of
fetching
the
box
the
dog
would
not
come
nor
was
it
possible
to
get
hold
of
him
this
happened
a
few
times
but
then
stubberud
hit
upon
a
stratagem
when
funcho
as
usual
even
on
a
fish
evening
watched
the
scene
of
chaining
up
the
other
dogs
from
a
distance
stubberud
went
calmly
up
to
the
wall
took
the
empty
box
that
lay
there
put
it
on
his
shoulder
and
returned
to
the
tent
funcho
was
taken
in
he
hurried
joyfully
into
the
tent
delighted
no
doubt
with
stubberud
generosity
in
providing
meat
two
evenings
running
but
there
to
his
great
surprise
a
very
different
reception
awaited
him
from
that
he
expected
he
was
seized
by
the
neck
and
made
fast
for
the
night
after
an
ugly
scowl
at
the
empty
box
he
looked
at
stubberud
what
he
thought
i
am
not
sure
certain
it
is
that
the
ruse
was
not
often
successful
after
that
funcho
got
a
dried
fish
for
supper
and
had
to
be
content
with
it
we
did
not
lose
many
dogs
in
the
course
of
the
winter
two
jeppe
and
jakob
died
of
some
disease
or
other
knaegten
was
shot
as
he
lost
almost
all
his
hair
over
half
his
body
madeiro
born
at
madeira
disappeared
early
in
the
autumn
tom
disappeared
later
both
these
undoubtedly
fell
into
crevasses
we
had
a
very
good
opportunity
twice
of
seeing
how
this
might
happen
both
times
we
saw
the
dog
disappear
into
the
crevasse
and
could
watch
him
from
the
surface
he
went
quite
quietly
backwards
and
forwards
down
below
without
uttering
a
sound
these
crevasses
were
not
deep
but
they
were
so
that
the
dog
could
not
get
out
without
help
the
two
dogs
i
have
mentioned
undoubtedly
met
their
death
in
this
way
a
slow
death
it
must
be
when
one
remembers
how
tenacious
of
life
a
dog
is
it
happened
several
times
that
dogs
disappeared
were
absent
for
some
days
and
then
came
back
possibly
they
had
been
down
a
crevasse
and
had
finally
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
it
again
curiously
enough
they
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
weather
when
they
went
on
trips
of
this
kind
when
the
humour
took
them
they
would
disappear
even
if
the
temperature
was
down
in
the
fifties
below
zero
with
wind
and
driving
snow
thus
jaala
a
lady
belonging
to
bjaaland
took
it
into
her
head
to
go
off
with
three
attendant
cavaliers
we
came
upon
them
later
they
were
then
lying
quietly
behind
a
hummock
down
on
the
ice
and
seemed
to
be
quite
happy
they
had
been
away
for
about
eight
days
without
food
and
during
that
time
the
temperature
had
seldom
been
above
august
arrived
calm
partly
overcast
and
finer
weather
for
taking
out
our
sledges
and
driving
them
over
to
the
could
not
be
imagined
they
had
to
be
brought
up
through
the
door
of
the
clothing
store
it
was
the
largest
and
the
easiest
to
get
through
we
had
first
to
dig
away
the
snow
which
latterly
had
been
allowed
to
collect
there
as
the
inmates
of
this
department
had
for
some
time
past
used
the
inner
passage
the
snow
had
blotted
out
everything
so
that
no
sign
of
the
entrance
could
be
seen
but
with
a
couple
of
strong
shovels
and
a
couple
of
strong
men
to
use
them
the
opening
was
soon
laid
bare
to
get
the
sledges
up
was
a
longer
business
they
weighed
pounds
apiece
and
the
way
up
to
the
surface
was
steep
a
tackle
was
rigged
and
by
hauling
and
shoving
they
slowly
one
by
one
came
up
into
daylight
we
dragged
them
away
to
a
place
near
the
so
as
to
get
a
clear
start
away
from
the
house
the
dogs
were
fresh
and
wild
and
wanted
plenty
of
room
a
case
not
to
mention
a
post
still
less
the
would
all
have
been
objects
of
extreme
interest
to
which
if
there
had
been
the
slightest
opportunity
their
course
would
infallibly
have
been
directed
the
protests
of
their
drivers
would
have
been
of
little
avail
the
dogs
had
not
been
let
loose
that
morning
and
every
man
was
now
in
his
tent
harnessing
them
meanwhile
i
stood
contemplating
the
packed
sledges
that
stood
there
ready
to
begin
the
long
journey
i
tried
to
work
up
a
little
poetry
the
spirit
of
man
the
mysterious
wilderness
of
ice
but
it
was
no
good
i
suppose
it
was
too
early
in
the
morning
i
abandoned
my
efforts
after
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
each
sledge
gave
one
more
the
idea
of
a
coffin
than
of
anything
else
all
the
cases
being
painted
black
it
was
as
we
had
expected
the
dogs
were
on
the
verge
of
exploding
what
a
time
we
had
getting
them
all
into
the
traces
they
could
not
stand
still
an
instant
either
it
was
a
friend
they
wanted
to
wish
or
it
was
an
enemy
they
were
longing
to
fly
at
there
was
always
something
going
on
when
they
kicked
out
with
their
raising
a
cloud
of
snow
or
glared
defiantly
at
each
other
it
often
caused
their
driver
an
anxious
moment
if
he
had
his
eye
on
them
at
this
stage
he
might
by
intervening
quickly
and
firmly
prevent
the
impending
battle
but
one
can
not
be
everywhere
at
once
and
the
result
was
a
series
of
the
wildest
fights
strange
beasts
they
had
been
going
about
the
place
comparatively
peacefully
the
whole
winter
and
now
as
soon
as
they
were
in
harness
they
must
needs
fight
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
at
last
we
were
all
ready
and
away
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
driven
with
teams
of
twelve
so
that
we
were
anxious
to
see
the
result
it
went
better
than
we
had
expected
of
course
not
like
an
express
train
but
we
could
not
expect
that
the
first
time
some
of
the
dogs
had
grown
too
fat
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
had
difficulty
in
keeping
up
for
them
this
first
trip
was
a
stiff
pull
but
most
of
them
were
in
excellent
condition
fine
rounded
bodies
not
lumpish
it
did
not
take
long
to
get
up
the
hill
this
time
most
of
them
had
to
stop
and
get
their
wind
on
the
slope
but
there
were
some
that
did
it
without
a
halt
up
at
the
top
everything
looked
just
as
we
had
left
it
in
april
the
flag
was
still
standing
where
we
had
planted
it
and
did
not
look
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
what
was
still
stranger
we
could
see
our
old
tracks
southward
we
drove
all
our
sledges
well
up
unharnessed
the
dogs
and
let
them
go
we
took
it
for
granted
that
they
would
all
rush
joyfully
home
to
the
nor
did
the
greater
number
disappoint
us
they
set
off
gaily
homewards
and
soon
the
ice
was
strewn
with
dogs
they
did
not
behave
altogether
like
good
children
in
some
places
there
was
a
sort
of
mist
over
the
ice
this
was
the
cloud
of
snow
thrown
up
by
the
combatants
but
on
their
return
they
were
irreproachable
one
could
not
take
any
notice
of
a
halt
here
and
there
at
the
inspection
that
evening
it
appeared
that
ten
of
them
were
missing
that
was
strange
could
all
ten
have
gone
down
crevasses
it
seemed
unlikely
next
morning
two
men
went
over
to
the
to
look
for
the
missing
dogs
on
the
way
they
crossed
a
couple
of
crevasses
but
there
was
no
dog
to
be
seen
when
they
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
sledges
stood
there
lay
all
ten
curled
up
asleep
they
were
lying
by
their
own
sledges
and
did
not
seem
to
take
the
slightest
notice
of
the
men
arrival
one
or
two
of
them
may
have
opened
an
eye
but
that
was
all
when
they
were
roused
and
given
to
understand
by
unmistakable
signs
that
their
presence
was
desired
at
home
they
seemed
astonished
beyond
all
bounds
some
of
them
simply
declined
to
believe
it
they
merely
turned
round
a
few
times
and
lay
down
again
on
the
same
spot
they
had
to
be
flogged
home
can
anything
more
inexplicable
be
imagined
there
they
lay
three
miles
from
their
comfortable
home
where
they
knew
that
abundance
of
food
awaited
them
in
a
temperature
of
although
they
had
now
been
out
for
hours
none
of
them
gave
a
sign
of
wanting
to
leave
the
spot
if
it
had
been
summer
with
warm
sunshine
one
might
have
understood
it
but
as
it
was
no
that
day
august
the
sun
appeared
above
the
barrier
again
for
the
first
time
in
four
months
he
looked
very
smiling
with
a
friendly
nod
for
the
old
he
had
seen
for
so
many
years
but
when
his
first
beams
reached
the
his
face
might
well
show
surprise
well
if
they
not
first
after
all
and
i
been
doing
all
i
could
to
get
here
it
could
not
be
denied
we
had
won
the
race
and
reached
the
barrier
a
day
before
him
the
day
for
our
actual
start
could
not
be
fixed
we
should
have
to
wait
until
the
temperature
moderated
somewhat
so
long
as
it
continued
to
grovel
in
the
depths
we
could
not
think
of
setting
out
all
our
things
were
now
ready
up
on
the
barrier
and
nothing
remained
but
to
harness
the
dogs
and
start
when
i
say
all
our
things
were
ready
this
is
not
the
impression
anyone
would
have
gained
who
looked
in
on
us
the
cutting
out
and
sewing
were
going
on
worse
than
ever
what
had
previously
occurred
to
one
as
a
thing
of
secondary
importance
which
might
be
done
if
there
was
time
but
might
otherwise
quite
well
be
dropped
now
suddenly
appeared
as
the
most
important
part
of
the
whole
outfit
and
then
out
came
the
knife
and
cut
away
until
great
heaps
of
offcuts
and
hair
lay
about
the
floor
then
the
needle
was
produced
and
seam
after
seam
added
to
those
there
were
already
the
days
went
by
and
the
temperature
would
give
no
sign
of
spring
now
and
then
it
would
make
a
jump
of
about
thirty
degrees
but
only
to
sink
just
as
rapidly
back
to
it
is
not
at
all
pleasant
to
hang
about
waiting
like
this
i
always
have
the
idea
that
i
am
the
only
one
who
is
left
behind
while
all
the
others
are
out
on
the
road
and
i
could
guess
that
i
was
not
the
only
one
of
us
who
felt
this
i
give
something
to
know
how
far
scott
is
oh
he
not
out
yet
bless
you
it
much
too
cold
for
his
ponies
ah
but
how
do
you
know
they
have
it
as
cold
as
this
i
expect
far
warmer
where
they
are
among
the
mountains
and
you
can
take
your
oath
they
not
lying
idle
those
boys
have
shown
what
they
can
do
this
was
the
sort
of
conversation
one
could
hear
daily
the
uncertainty
was
worrying
many
of
us
not
all
and
personally
i
felt
it
a
great
deal
i
was
determined
to
get
away
as
soon
as
it
was
at
all
possible
and
the
objection
that
much
might
be
lost
by
starting
too
early
did
not
seem
to
me
to
have
much
force
if
we
saw
that
it
was
too
cold
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
turn
back
so
that
i
could
not
see
there
was
any
risk
september
came
with
that
is
a
temperature
that
one
can
always
stand
but
we
had
better
wait
and
see
what
it
is
going
to
do
perhaps
it
will
only
play
its
old
tricks
again
next
day
calm
and
clear
september
at
last
the
change
had
come
and
we
thought
it
was
high
time
next
day
the
little
slant
of
wind
that
came
from
the
east
felt
quite
like
a
mild
spring
breeze
well
at
any
rate
we
now
had
a
good
temperature
to
start
in
every
man
ready
we
are
off
september
arrived
we
turned
out
as
usual
had
breakfast
and
were
then
on
the
move
we
had
not
much
to
do
the
empty
sledges
we
were
to
use
for
driving
up
to
the
were
ready
we
only
had
to
throw
a
few
things
on
to
them
but
it
turned
out
that
the
mere
fact
of
having
so
few
things
was
the
cause
of
its
taking
a
long
time
we
were
to
harness
twelve
dogs
to
the
empty
sledges
and
we
had
an
idea
that
it
would
cost
us
a
struggle
to
get
away
we
helped
each
other
two
and
two
to
bring
the
dogs
to
the
sledges
and
harness
them
those
who
were
really
careful
had
anchored
their
sledges
to
a
peg
firmly
fixed
in
the
snow
others
had
contented
themselves
with
capsizing
their
sledges
and
others
again
were
even
more
reckless
we
all
had
to
be
ready
before
the
first
man
could
start
otherwise
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
those
who
were
behind
to
hold
in
their
dogs
and
the
result
would
have
been
a
false
start
our
dogs
were
in
a
fearful
state
of
excitement
and
confusion
that
morning
but
at
last
everything
was
ready
barring
one
or
two
trifles
then
i
suddenly
heard
a
wild
yell
and
spinning
round
i
saw
a
team
tearing
off
without
a
driver
the
next
driver
rushed
forward
to
help
with
the
result
that
his
dogs
made
off
after
the
others
the
two
sledges
were
on
ahead
and
the
two
drivers
after
them
in
full
gallop
but
the
odds
were
too
unequal
in
a
few
moments
the
drivers
were
beaten
the
two
runaway
teams
had
made
off
in
a
direction
and
were
going
like
the
wind
the
men
had
hard
work
they
had
long
ago
stopped
running
and
were
now
following
in
the
tracks
of
the
sledges
the
dogs
had
disappeared
behind
the
ridges
which
the
men
did
not
reach
till
much
later
meanwhile
the
rest
of
us
waited
the
question
was
what
would
those
two
do
when
at
last
they
had
come
up
with
their
sledges
would
they
turn
and
go
home
or
would
they
drive
up
to
the
waiting
was
no
fun
under
any
circumstances
and
so
we
decided
to
go
on
to
the
and
if
necessary
wait
there
no
sooner
said
than
done
and
away
we
went
now
we
should
see
what
command
the
fellows
had
over
their
dogs
for
in
all
canine
probability
these
teams
would
now
try
to
follow
the
same
course
that
the
runaways
had
taken
this
fear
turned
out
not
to
be
groundless
three
managed
to
turn
their
dogs
and
put
them
in
the
right
direction
but
the
other
two
were
off
on
the
new
course
afterwards
of
course
they
tried
to
make
out
that
they
thought
we
were
all
going
that
way
i
smiled
but
said
nothing
it
had
happened
more
than
once
that
my
own
dogs
had
taken
charge
no
doubt
i
had
felt
rather
foolish
at
the
time
but
after
all
it
was
not
till
noon
that
we
all
assembled
with
our
sledges
the
drivers
of
the
runaways
had
had
stiff
work
to
catch
them
and
were
wet
through
with
their
exertions
i
had
some
thoughts
of
turning
back
as
three
young
puppies
had
followed
us
if
we
went
on
we
should
have
to
shoot
them
but
to
turn
back
after
all
this
work
and
then
probably
have
the
same
thing
over
again
next
morning
was
not
a
pleasant
prospect
and
above
all
to
see
lindstrom
standing
at
the
door
shaking
with
laughter
no
we
had
better
go
on
i
think
we
were
all
agreed
in
this
the
dogs
were
now
harnessed
to
the
loaded
sledges
and
the
empty
ones
were
stacked
one
above
another
at
we
were
off
the
old
tracks
were
soon
lost
sight
of
but
we
immediately
picked
up
the
line
of
flags
that
had
been
set
up
at
every
second
kilometre
on
the
last
depot
journey
the
going
was
splendid
and
we
went
at
a
rattling
pace
to
the
south
we
did
not
go
very
far
the
first
day
eleven
and
miles
and
pitched
our
camp
at
the
first
night
out
is
never
very
pleasant
but
this
time
it
was
awful
there
was
such
a
row
going
on
among
our
ninety
dogs
that
we
could
not
close
our
eyes
it
was
a
blessed
relief
when
four
in
the
morning
came
round
and
we
could
begin
to
get
up
we
had
to
shoot
the
three
puppies
when
we
stopped
for
lunch
that
day
the
going
was
the
same
nothing
could
be
better
the
flags
we
were
following
stood
just
as
we
had
left
them
they
showed
no
trace
of
there
having
been
any
snowfall
in
the
interval
that
day
we
did
fifteen
and
a
half
miles
the
dogs
were
not
yet
in
training
but
were
picking
up
every
hour
by
the
they
seemed
to
have
reached
their
full
vigour
that
day
none
of
us
could
hold
in
his
team
they
all
wanted
to
get
forward
with
the
result
that
one
team
ran
into
another
and
confusion
followed
this
was
a
tiresome
business
the
dogs
wore
themselves
out
to
no
purpose
and
of
course
the
time
spent
in
extricating
them
from
one
another
was
lost
they
were
perfectly
wild
that
day
when
lassesen
for
instance
caught
sight
of
his
enemy
hans
who
was
in
another
team
he
immediately
encouraged
his
friend
fix
to
help
him
these
two
then
put
on
all
the
speed
they
could
with
the
result
that
the
others
in
the
same
team
were
excited
by
the
sudden
acceleration
and
joined
in
the
spurt
it
made
no
difference
how
the
driver
tried
to
stop
them
they
went
on
just
as
furiously
until
they
reached
the
team
that
included
the
object
of
lassesen
and
fix
endeavours
then
the
two
teams
dashed
into
each
other
and
we
had
legs
to
sort
out
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
was
to
let
those
who
could
not
hold
in
their
teams
unharness
some
of
the
dogs
and
tie
them
on
the
sledge
in
this
way
we
got
things
to
work
satisfactorily
at
last
we
covered
eighteen
and
a
half
miles
that
day
on
monday
the
we
woke
up
to
a
temperature
of
the
weather
was
splendid
calm
and
clear
we
could
see
by
the
dogs
that
they
were
not
feeling
happy
as
they
had
kept
comparatively
quiet
that
night
the
cold
affected
the
going
at
once
it
was
slow
and
unyielding
we
came
across
some
crevasses
and
hanssen
sledge
was
nearly
in
one
but
it
was
held
up
and
he
came
out
of
it
without
serious
consequences
the
cold
caused
no
discomfort
on
the
march
on
the
contrary
at
times
it
was
too
warm
one
breath
was
like
a
cloud
and
so
thick
was
the
vapour
over
the
dogs
that
one
could
not
see
one
team
from
the
next
though
the
sledges
were
being
driven
close
to
one
another
on
the
it
was
with
a
breeze
dead
against
us
this
was
undeniably
bitter
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
temperature
was
too
much
for
the
dogs
in
the
morning
especially
they
were
a
pitiful
sight
they
lay
rolled
up
as
tightly
as
possible
with
their
noses
under
their
tails
and
from
time
to
time
one
could
see
a
shiver
run
through
their
bodies
indeed
some
of
them
were
constantly
shivering
we
had
to
lift
them
up
and
put
them
into
their
harness
i
had
to
admit
that
with
this
temperature
it
would
not
pay
to
go
on
the
risk
was
too
great
we
therefore
decided
to
drive
on
to
the
depot
in
and
unload
our
sledges
there
on
that
day
too
we
made
the
awkward
discovery
that
the
fluid
in
our
compasses
had
frozen
rendering
them
useless
the
weather
had
become
very
thick
and
we
could
only
guess
vaguely
the
position
of
the
sun
our
progress
under
these
circumstances
was
very
doubtful
possibly
we
were
on
the
right
course
but
it
was
just
as
probable
nay
more
so
that
we
were
off
it
the
best
thing
we
could
do
therefore
was
to
pitch
our
camp
and
wait
for
a
better
state
of
things
we
did
not
bless
the
who
had
supplied
those
compasses
it
was
when
we
stopped
in
order
to
have
a
good
shelter
for
the
long
day
before
us
we
decided
to
build
two
the
snow
was
not
good
for
this
purpose
but
by
fetching
blocks
from
all
sides
we
managed
to
put
up
the
huts
hanssen
built
one
and
wisting
the
other
in
a
temperature
such
as
we
now
had
a
is
greatly
preferable
to
a
tent
and
we
felt
quite
comfortable
when
we
came
in
and
got
the
primus
going
that
night
we
heard
a
strange
noise
round
us
i
looked
under
my
bag
to
see
whether
we
had
far
to
drop
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
disturbance
anywhere
in
the
other
but
they
had
heard
nothing
we
afterwards
discovered
that
the
sound
was
only
due
to
snow
settling
by
this
expression
i
mean
the
movement
that
takes
place
when
a
large
extent
of
the
snow
surface
breaks
and
sinks
settles
down
this
movement
gives
one
the
idea
that
the
ground
is
sinking
under
one
and
it
is
not
a
pleasant
feeling
it
is
followed
by
a
dull
roar
which
often
makes
the
dogs
jump
into
the
air
and
their
drivers
too
for
that
matter
once
we
heard
this
booming
on
the
plateau
so
loud
that
it
seemed
like
the
thunder
of
cannon
we
soon
grew
accustomed
to
it
next
day
the
temperature
was
calm
and
perfectly
clear
we
did
eighteen
and
a
half
miles
and
kept
our
course
as
well
as
we
could
with
the
help
of
the
sun
it
was
when
we
camped
this
time
i
had
done
a
thing
that
i
have
always
been
opposed
to
i
had
brought
spirits
with
me
in
the
form
of
a
bottle
of
norwegian
aquavit
and
a
bottle
of
gin
i
thought
this
a
suitable
occasion
to
bring
in
the
gin
it
was
as
hard
as
flint
right
through
while
we
were
thawing
it
the
bottle
burst
and
we
threw
it
out
into
the
snow
with
the
result
that
all
the
dogs
started
to
sneeze
the
next
bottle
aquavit
no
was
like
a
bone
but
we
had
learnt
wisdom
by
experience
and
we
succeeded
with
care
in
thawing
it
out
we
waited
till
we
were
all
in
our
bags
and
then
we
had
one
i
was
greatly
disappointed
it
was
not
half
so
good
as
i
had
thought
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
shall
never
do
so
again
the
effect
was
nil
i
felt
nothing
either
in
my
head
or
my
feet
the
was
cool
the
temperature
remained
at
fortunately
it
was
clear
so
that
we
could
see
where
we
were
going
we
had
not
gone
far
before
a
bright
projection
appeared
on
the
level
surface
out
with
the
glasses
the
depot
there
it
lay
right
in
our
course
hanssen
who
had
driven
first
the
whole
way
without
a
forerunner
and
for
the
most
part
without
a
compass
had
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
his
performance
we
agreed
that
it
was
well
done
and
that
no
doubt
was
all
the
thanks
he
got
we
reached
it
at
and
unloaded
our
sledges
at
once
wisting
undertook
the
far
from
pleasant
task
of
getting
us
a
cup
of
warm
milk
at
he
put
the
primus
behind
one
of
the
cases
of
provisions
and
set
it
going
strangely
enough
the
paraffin
was
still
liquid
in
the
vessel
but
this
was
no
doubt
because
it
had
been
well
protected
in
the
case
a
cup
of
malted
milk
tasted
better
that
day
than
the
last
time
i
had
tried
it
in
a
restaurant
in
chicago
having
enjoyed
that
we
threw
ourselves
on
the
almost
empty
sledges
and
set
our
course
for
home
the
going
was
difficult
but
with
the
light
weight
they
now
had
to
pull
the
dogs
went
along
well
i
sat
with
wisting
as
i
considered
his
team
the
strongest
the
cold
held
on
unchanged
and
i
was
often
surprised
that
it
was
possible
to
sit
still
on
the
sledges
as
we
did
without
freezing
but
we
got
on
quite
well
one
or
two
i
saw
off
their
sledges
all
day
and
most
of
us
jumped
off
from
time
to
time
and
ran
by
the
side
to
get
warm
i
myself
took
to
my
ski
and
let
myself
be
pulled
along
this
sport
has
never
appealed
to
me
but
under
the
circumstances
it
was
permissible
it
warmed
my
feet
and
that
was
the
object
of
it
i
again
had
recourse
to
this
sport
of
later
on
but
that
was
for
another
reason
on
the
as
we
sat
in
the
tent
cooking
and
chatting
hanssen
suddenly
said
why
i
believe
my
heel
gone
off
came
his
stockings
and
there
was
a
big
dead
heel
like
a
lump
of
tallow
it
did
not
look
well
he
rubbed
it
until
he
thought
he
could
feel
something
again
and
then
put
his
feet
back
in
his
stockings
and
got
into
his
bag
now
it
was
stubberud
turn
blest
if
i
do
think
there
something
wrong
with
mine
too
same
proceeding
same
result
this
was
pleasant
two
doubtful
heels
and
miles
from
framheim
when
we
started
next
morning
it
was
fortunately
milder
almost
summer
it
felt
quite
pleasant
the
difference
between
and
is
in
my
opinion
very
perceptible
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
that
when
one
gets
so
far
down
a
few
degrees
one
way
or
the
other
do
not
make
any
difference
but
they
do
while
driving
that
day
we
were
obliged
to
let
loose
several
of
the
dogs
who
could
not
keep
up
we
supposed
that
they
would
follow
our
tracks
adam
and
lazarus
were
never
seen
again
sara
fell
dead
on
the
way
without
any
previous
symptom
camilla
was
also
among
those
let
loose
on
the
way
home
we
kept
the
same
order
as
on
the
previous
days
hanssen
and
wisting
as
a
rule
were
a
long
way
ahead
unless
they
stopped
and
waited
we
went
at
a
tearing
pace
we
had
thought
of
halting
at
the
flag
as
we
called
it
the
mark
at
thirty
kilometres
from
framheim
and
waiting
for
the
others
to
come
up
but
as
the
weather
was
of
the
best
calm
and
clear
and
with
our
tracks
on
the
way
south
perfectly
plain
i
decided
to
go
on
the
sooner
we
got
the
bad
heels
into
the
house
the
better
the
two
first
sledges
arrived
at
the
next
at
and
the
two
following
ones
at
the
last
did
not
come
in
till
heaven
knows
what
they
had
been
doing
on
the
way
with
the
low
temperatures
we
experienced
on
this
trip
we
noticed
a
curious
that
i
had
never
seen
before
fine
extremely
fine
collected
and
formed
small
cylindrical
bodies
of
an
average
diameter
of
inches
and
about
the
same
height
they
were
however
of
various
sizes
they
generally
rolled
over
the
surface
like
a
wheel
and
now
and
then
collected
into
large
heaps
from
which
again
one
by
one
or
several
together
they
continued
their
rolling
if
you
took
one
of
these
bodies
in
the
hand
there
was
no
increase
of
weight
to
be
felt
not
the
very
slightest
if
you
took
one
of
the
largest
and
crushed
it
there
was
so
to
speak
nothing
left
with
the
temperature
in
the
we
did
not
see
them
as
soon
as
we
came
home
we
attended
to
the
heels
prestrud
had
both
his
heels
frozen
one
slightly
the
other
more
severely
though
so
far
as
i
could
determine
not
so
badly
as
the
other
two
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
lance
the
big
blisters
that
had
formed
and
let
out
the
fluid
they
contained
afterwards
we
put
on
boracic
compresses
night
and
morning
we
kept
up
this
treatment
for
a
long
time
at
last
the
old
skin
could
be
removed
and
the
new
lay
there
fresh
and
healthy
the
heel
was
cured
circumstances
had
arisen
which
made
me
consider
it
necessary
to
divide
the
party
into
two
one
party
was
to
carry
out
the
march
to
the
south
the
other
was
to
try
to
reach
king
edward
vii
land
and
see
what
was
to
be
done
there
besides
exploring
the
region
around
the
bay
of
whales
this
party
was
composed
of
prestrud
stubberud
and
johansen
under
the
leadership
of
the
the
advantages
of
this
new
arrangement
were
many
in
the
first
place
a
smaller
party
could
advance
more
rapidly
than
a
larger
one
our
numbers
both
of
men
and
dogs
on
several
of
the
previous
trips
had
clearly
shown
the
arrangement
to
be
unfortunate
the
time
we
took
to
get
ready
in
the
morning
four
hours
was
one
of
the
consequences
of
being
a
large
party
with
half
the
number
or
only
one
tent
full
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
reduce
this
time
by
half
the
importance
of
the
depots
we
had
laid
down
was
of
course
greatly
increased
since
they
would
now
only
have
to
support
five
members
of
the
party
originally
contemplated
and
would
thus
be
able
to
furnish
them
with
supplies
for
so
much
more
time
from
a
purely
scientific
point
of
view
the
change
offered
such
obvious
advantages
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
insist
upon
them
henceforward
therefore
we
worked
so
to
speak
in
two
parties
the
polar
party
was
to
leave
as
soon
as
spring
came
in
earnest
i
left
it
to
prestrud
himself
to
fix
the
departure
of
the
party
he
was
to
lead
there
was
no
such
hurry
for
them
they
could
take
things
more
easily
then
the
same
old
fuss
about
the
outfit
began
all
over
again
and
the
needles
were
busy
the
whole
time
two
days
after
our
return
wisting
and
bjaaland
went
out
to
the
mark
with
the
object
of
bringing
in
the
dogs
that
had
been
let
loose
on
that
part
of
the
route
and
had
not
yet
returned
they
made
the
trip
of
sixty
kilometres
and
a
half
miles
in
six
hours
and
brought
all
the
stragglers
ten
of
them
back
with
them
the
farthest
of
them
were
found
lying
by
the
flag
none
of
them
showed
a
sign
of
getting
up
when
the
sledges
came
they
had
to
be
picked
up
and
harnessed
and
one
or
two
that
had
sore
feet
were
driven
on
the
sledges
in
all
probability
most
of
them
would
have
returned
in
a
few
days
but
it
is
incomprehensible
that
healthy
plucky
dogs
as
many
of
them
were
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
stay
behind
like
that
on
september
we
had
the
first
tidings
of
spring
when
bjaaland
came
back
from
the
ice
and
told
us
he
had
shot
a
seal
so
the
seals
had
begun
to
come
up
on
to
the
ice
this
was
a
good
sign
the
next
day
we
went
out
to
bring
it
in
and
we
got
another
at
the
same
time
there
was
excitement
among
the
dogs
when
they
got
fresh
meat
to
say
nothing
of
fresh
blubber
nor
were
we
men
inclined
to
say
no
to
a
fresh
steak
on
september
we
removed
the
roof
that
had
covered
over
the
window
of
our
room
we
had
to
carry
the
light
down
through
a
long
wooden
channel
so
that
it
was
considerably
reduced
by
the
time
it
came
in
but
it
was
light
genuine
daylight
and
it
was
much
appreciated
on
the
camilla
came
back
after
an
absence
of
ten
days
she
had
been
let
loose
miles
from
framheim
on
the
last
trip
when
she
came
in
she
was
as
fat
as
ever
probably
she
had
been
feasting
in
her
solitude
on
one
of
her
comrades
she
was
received
with
great
ovations
by
her
many
admirers
on
september
a
still
more
certain
sign
of
spring
appeared
a
flight
of
antarctic
petrels
they
came
flying
up
to
us
to
bring
the
news
that
now
spring
had
come
this
time
in
earnest
we
were
delighted
to
see
these
fine
swift
birds
again
they
flew
round
the
house
several
times
to
see
whether
we
were
all
there
still
and
we
were
not
long
in
going
out
to
receive
them
it
was
amusing
to
watch
the
dogs
at
first
the
birds
flew
pretty
near
the
ground
when
the
dogs
caught
sight
of
them
they
rushed
out
the
whole
lot
of
them
to
catch
them
they
tore
along
scouring
the
ground
and
of
course
all
wanted
to
be
first
then
the
birds
suddenly
rose
into
the
air
and
presently
the
dogs
lost
sight
of
them
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
glaring
at
each
other
evidently
uncertain
of
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
such
uncertainty
does
not
as
a
rule
last
long
they
made
up
their
minds
with
all
desirable
promptitude
and
flew
at
each
other
throats
so
now
spring
had
really
arrived
we
had
only
to
cure
the
heels
