the
flaming
forest
i
an
hour
ago
under
the
marvelous
canopy
of
the
blue
northern
sky
david
carrigan
sergeant
in
his
most
excellent
majesty
royal
northwest
mounted
police
had
hummed
softly
to
himself
and
had
thanked
god
that
he
was
alive
he
had
blessed
mcvane
superintendent
of
n
division
at
athabasca
landing
for
detailing
him
to
the
mission
on
which
he
was
bent
he
was
glad
that
he
was
traveling
alone
and
in
the
deep
forest
and
that
for
many
weeks
his
adventure
would
carry
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
beloved
north
making
his
noonday
tea
over
a
fire
at
the
edge
of
the
river
with
the
green
forest
crowding
like
an
inundation
on
three
sides
of
him
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
for
the
hundredth
time
perhaps
that
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
be
alone
in
the
world
for
he
was
on
what
his
comrades
at
the
landing
called
a
bad
assignment
if
anything
happens
to
me
carrigan
had
said
to
mcvane
there
anybody
in
particular
to
notify
i
lost
out
in
the
matter
of
family
a
long
time
ago
he
was
not
a
man
who
talked
much
about
himself
even
to
the
superintendent
of
n
division
yet
there
were
a
thousand
who
loved
dave
carrigan
and
many
who
placed
their
confidences
in
him
superintendent
me
vane
had
one
story
which
he
might
have
told
but
he
kept
it
to
himself
instinctively
sensing
the
sacredness
of
it
even
carrigan
did
not
know
that
the
one
thing
which
never
passed
his
lips
was
known
to
mcvane
of
that
too
he
had
been
thinking
an
hour
ago
it
was
the
thing
which
first
of
all
had
driven
him
into
the
north
and
though
it
had
twisted
and
disrupted
the
earth
under
his
feet
for
a
time
it
had
brought
its
compensation
for
he
had
come
to
love
the
north
with
a
passionate
devotion
it
was
in
a
way
his
god
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
time
had
never
been
when
he
had
lived
any
other
life
than
this
under
the
open
skies
he
was
now
a
bit
of
a
philosopher
as
philosophy
comes
to
one
in
a
and
unpolluted
air
a
brother
of
humanity
even
when
he
put
manacles
on
other
men
wrists
graying
a
little
over
the
temples
and
a
lover
of
life
above
all
else
he
was
that
a
lover
of
life
a
worshiper
at
the
shrine
of
country
so
he
sat
that
hour
ago
deep
in
the
wilderness
eighty
miles
north
of
athabasca
landing
congratulating
himself
on
the
present
conditions
of
his
existence
a
hundred
and
eighty
miles
farther
on
was
fort
mcmurray
and
another
two
hundred
beyond
that
was
chipewyan
and
still
beyond
that
the
mackenzie
and
its
trail
to
the
northern
sea
he
was
glad
there
was
no
end
to
this
world
of
his
he
was
glad
there
were
few
people
in
it
but
these
people
he
loved
that
hour
ago
he
had
looked
out
on
the
river
as
two
york
boats
had
forged
up
against
the
stream
craft
like
the
long
slim
galleys
of
old
brought
over
through
the
churchill
and
clearwater
countries
from
hudson
bay
there
were
eight
rowers
in
each
boat
they
were
singing
their
voices
rolled
between
the
walls
of
the
forests
their
naked
arms
and
shoulders
glistened
in
the
sun
they
rowed
like
vikings
and
to
him
they
were
symbols
of
the
freedom
of
the
world
he
had
watched
them
until
they
were
gone
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
chanting
of
their
voices
had
died
away
and
then
he
had
risen
from
beside
his
tiny
fire
and
had
stretched
himself
until
his
muscles
cracked
it
was
good
to
feel
the
blood
running
red
and
strong
in
one
veins
at
the
age
of
for
carrigan
felt
the
thrill
of
these
days
when
strong
men
were
coming
out
of
the
north
days
when
the
glory
of
june
hung
over
the
land
when
out
of
the
deep
wilderness
threaded
by
the
three
rivers
came
romance
and
courage
and
men
and
women
of
an
almost
forgotten
people
to
laugh
and
sing
and
barter
for
a
time
with
the
outpost
guardians
of
a
younger
and
more
progressive
world
it
was
north
of
and
the
waters
of
a
continent
flowed
toward
the
arctic
sea
yet
soon
would
the
strawberries
be
crushing
red
underfoot
the
forest
road
was
in
bloom
scarlet
reddened
the
trail
wild
hyacinths
and
violets
played
with
the
in
the
meadows
and
the
sky
was
a
great
splash
of
velvety
blue
it
was
the
north
triumphant
at
the
edge
of
civilization
the
north
triumphant
and
yet
paying
its
tribute
for
at
the
other
end
were
waiting
the
royal
upper
ten
thousand
and
the
smart
four
hundred
with
all
the
beau
monde
behind
them
coveting
and
demanding
that
tribute
to
their
sex
the
silken
furs
of
a
far
country
the
blood
and
labor
of
a
land
infinitely
beyond
the
pale
of
and
the
whims
of
fashion
carrigan
had
thought
of
these
things
that
hour
ago
as
he
sat
at
the
edge
of
the
first
of
the
three
rivers
the
great
athabasca
from
down
the
other
two
the
slave
and
the
mackenzie
the
fur
fleets
of
the
unmapped
country
had
been
toiling
since
the
first
breakups
of
ice
steadily
week
after
week
the
north
had
been
emptying
itself
of
its
picturesque
tide
of
life
and
voice
of
muscle
and
brawn
of
laughter
and
song
and
wealth
through
long
months
of
deep
winter
in
ten
thousand
shacks
and
tepees
and
cabins
the
story
of
this
june
had
been
written
as
fate
had
written
it
each
winter
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
a
story
of
the
triumph
of
the
fittest
a
story
of
tears
of
happiness
here
and
there
of
hunger
and
plenty
of
new
life
and
quick
death
a
story
of
strong
men
and
strong
women
living
in
the
faith
of
their
forefathers
with
the
best
blood
of
old
england
and
france
still
surviving
in
their
veins
through
those
same
months
of
winter
the
great
captains
of
trade
in
the
city
of
edmonton
had
been
preparing
for
the
coming
of
the
river
brigades
the
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
trail
between
that
last
city
outpost
of
civilization
and
athabasca
landing
the
door
that
opened
into
the
north
were
packed
hard
by
team
and
and
packer
bringing
up
the
freight
that
for
another
year
was
to
last
the
forest
people
of
the
three
river
country
a
domain
reaching
from
the
landing
to
the
arctic
ocean
in
competition
fought
the
drivers
of
revillon
brothers
and
hudson
bay
of
free
trader
and
independent
adventurer
freight
that
grew
more
precious
with
each
mile
it
advanced
must
reach
the
beginning
of
the
waterway
it
started
with
the
early
snows
the
tide
was
at
full
by
midwinter
in
temperature
that
nipped
men
lungs
it
did
not
cease
there
was
no
in
the
of
the
masters
of
trade
at
edmonton
winnipeg
montreal
and
london
across
the
sea
it
was
not
a
work
of
philanthropy
these
men
cared
not
whether
jean
and
jacqueline
and
pierre
and
marie
were
or
hungry
whether
they
lived
or
died
so
far
as
humanity
was
concerned
but
paris
vienna
london
and
the
great
capitals
of
the
earth
must
have
their
furs
and
unless
that
freight
went
north
there
would
be
no
velvety
offerings
for
the
white
shoulders
of
the
world
christmas
windows
two
years
hence
would
be
bare
a
feminine
wail
of
grief
would
rise
to
the
skies
for
woman
must
have
her
furs
and
in
return
for
those
furs
jean
and
jacqueline
and
pierre
and
marie
must
have
their
freight
so
the
pendulum
swung
as
it
had
swung
for
a
century
or
two
touching
on
the
one
side
luxury
warmth
wealth
and
beauty
on
the
other
cold
and
hardship
deep
snows
and
open
skies
with
that
precious
freight
the
thing
between
and
now
in
this
year
before
rail
and
steamboat
the
glory
of
early
summer
was
at
hand
and
the
wilderness
people
were
coming
up
to
meet
the
freight
the
three
rivers
the
athabasca
the
slave
and
the
mackenzie
all
joining
in
one
great
waterway
to
the
northern
sea
were
athrill
with
the
wild
impulse
and
beat
of
life
as
the
forest
people
lived
it
the
great
father
had
sent
in
his
treaty
money
and
cree
song
and
chipewyan
chant
joined
the
melodies
of
french
and
countless
canoes
drove
past
the
slower
and
mightier
scow
brigades
huge
york
boats
with
two
rows
of
oars
heaved
up
and
down
like
the
ancient
galleys
of
rome
tightly
woven
cribs
of
timber
and
giant
rafts
made
tip
of
many
cribs
were
ready
for
their
long
drift
into
a
timberless
country
on
this
waterway
a
world
had
gathered
it
was
the
nile
of
the
northland
and
each
post
and
gathering
place
along
its
length
was
turned
into
a
metropolis
half
savage
archaic
splendid
with
the
strength
of
red
blood
clear
eyes
and
souls
that
read
the
word
of
god
in
wind
and
tree
and
up
and
down
this
mighty
waterway
of
wilderness
trade
ran
the
whispering
spirit
of
song
like
the
voice
of
a
mighty
god
heard
under
the
stars
and
in
the
winds
but
it
was
an
hour
ago
that
david
carrigan
had
vividly
pictured
these
things
to
himself
close
to
the
big
river
and
many
things
may
happen
in
the
sixty
minutes
that
follow
any
given
minute
in
a
man
life
that
hour
ago
his
one
great
purpose
had
been
to
bring
in
black
roger
audemard
alive
or
dead
black
roger
the
forest
fiend
who
had
destroyed
half
a
dozen
lives
in
a
blind
passion
of
vengeance
nearly
fifteen
years
ago
for
ten
of
those
fifteen
years
it
had
been
thought
that
black
roger
was
dead
but
mysterious
rumors
had
lately
come
out
of
the
north
he
was
alive
people
had
seen
him
fact
followed
rumor
his
existence
became
certainty
the
law
took
up
once
more
his
hazardous
trail
and
david
carrigan
was
the
messenger
it
sent
bring
him
back
alive
or
dead
were
superintendent
mcvane
last
words
and
now
thinking
of
that
parting
injunction
carrigan
grinned
even
as
the
sweat
of
death
dampened
his
face
in
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
sun
for
at
the
end
of
those
sixty
minutes
that
had
passed
since
his
midday
pot
of
tea
the
grimly
atrociously
unexpected
had
happened
like
a
thunderbolt
out
of
the
azure
of
the
sky
ii
huddled
behind
a
rock
which
was
scarcely
larger
than
his
body
groveling
in
the
white
soft
sand
like
a
turtle
making
a
nest
for
its
eggs
carrigan
told
himself
this
without
any
reservation
he
was
as
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
for
the
comfort
of
his
soul
in
a
deuce
of
a
fix
his
head
was
bare
simply
because
a
bullet
had
taken
his
hat
away
his
blond
hair
was
filled
with
sand
his
face
was
sweating
but
his
blue
eyes
were
alight
with
a
grim
sort
of
humor
though
he
knew
that
unless
the
other
fellow
ammunition
ran
out
he
was
going
to
die
for
the
twentieth
time
in
as
many
minutes
he
looked
about
him
he
was
in
the
center
of
a
flat
area
of
sand
fifty
feet
from
him
the
river
murmured
gently
over
yellow
bars
and
a
carpet
of
pebbles
fifty
feet
on
the
opposite
side
of
him
was
the
cool
green
wall
of
the
forest
the
sunshine
playing
in
it
seemed
like
laughter
to
him
now
a
whimsical
sort
of
merriment
roused
by
the
sheer
effrontery
of
the
joke
which
fate
had
inflicted
upon
him
between
the
river
and
the
balsam
and
spruce
was
only
the
rock
behind
which
he
was
cringing
like
a
rabbit
afraid
to
take
to
the
open
and
his
rock
was
a
mere
of
the
solid
floor
of
shale
that
was
under
him
the
wash
sand
that
covered
it
like
a
carpet
was
not
more
than
four
or
five
inches
deep
he
could
not
dig
in
there
was
not
enough
of
it
within
reach
to
scrape
up
as
a
protection
and
his
enemy
a
hundred
yards
or
so
away
was
a
determined
wretch
and
the
deadliest
shot
he
had
ever
known
three
times
carrigan
had
made
experiments
to
prove
this
for
he
had
in
mind
a
sudden
rush
to
the
shelter
of
the
timber
three
times
he
had
raised
the
crown
of
his
hat
slightly
above
the
top
of
the
rock
and
three
times
the
marksmanship
of
the
other
had
perforated
it
with
neatness
and
dispatch
the
third
bullet
had
carried
his
hat
a
dozen
feet
away
whenever
he
showed
a
patch
of
his
clothing
a
bullet
replied
with
unerring
precision
twice
they
had
drawn
blood
and
the
humor
faded
out
of
carrigan
eyes
not
long
ago
he
had
exulted
in
the
bigness
and
glory
of
this
country
of
his
where
strong
men
met
hand
to
hand
and
eye
to
eye
there
were
the
other
kind
in
it
the
sort
that
made
his
profession
of
manhunting
a
thing
of
reality
and
danger
but
he
expected
these
forgot
them
when
the
wilderness
itself
filled
his
vision
but
his
present
situation
was
something
unlike
anything
that
had
ever
happened
in
his
previous
experience
with
the
outlawed
he
had
faced
dangers
he
had
fought
there
were
times
when
he
had
almost
died
fanchet
the
who
had
robbed
a
dozen
wilderness
mail
sledges
had
come
nearest
to
trapping
him
and
putting
him
out
of
business
fanchet
was
a
desperate
man
and
had
few
scruples
but
even
fanchet
before
he
was
caught
would
not
have
cornered
a
man
with
such
bloodthirsty
unfairness
as
carrigan
found
himself
cornered
now
he
no
longer
had
a
doubt
as
to
what
was
in
the
other
mind
it
was
not
to
wound
and
make
merely
helpless
it
was
to
kill
it
was
not
difficult
to
prove
this
careful
not
to
expose
a
part
of
his
arm
or
shoulder
he
drew
a
white
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
fastened
it
to
the
end
of
his
rifle
and
held
the
flag
of
surrender
three
feet
above
the
rock
and
then
with
equal
caution
he
slowly
thrust
up
a
flat
piece
of
shale
which
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
might
appear
as
his
shoulder
or
even
his
head
scarcely
was
it
four
inches
above
the
top
of
the
rock
before
there
came
the
report
of
a
rifle
and
the
shale
was
splintered
into
a
hundred
bits
carrigan
lowered
his
flag
and
gathered
himself
in
tighter
the
accuracy
of
the
other
marksmanship
was
appalling
he
knew
that
if
he
exposed
himself
for
an
instant
to
use
his
own
rifle
or
the
heavy
automatic
in
his
holster
he
would
be
a
dead
man
before
he
could
press
a
trigger
and
that
time
he
felt
equally
sure
would
come
sooner
or
later
his
muscles
were
growing
cramped
he
could
not
forever
double
himself
up
like
a
jackknife
behind
the
altogether
inefficient
shelter
of
the
rock
his
executioner
was
hidden
in
the
edge
of
the
timber
not
directly
opposite
him
but
nearly
a
hundred
yards
down
stream
twenty
times
he
had
wondered
why
the
fiend
with
the
rifle
did
not
creep
up
through
that
timber
and
take
a
good
open
at
him
from
the
vantage
point
which
lay
at
the
end
of
a
straight
line
between
his
rock
and
the
nearest
spruce
and
balsam
from
that
angle
he
could
not
completely
shelter
himself
but
the
man
a
hundred
yards
below
had
not
moved
a
foot
from
his
ambush
since
he
had
fired
his
first
shot
that
had
come
when
carrigan
was
crossing
the
open
space
of
soft
white
sand
it
had
left
a
burning
sensation
at
his
temple
half
an
inch
to
the
right
and
it
would
have
killed
him
swift
as
the
shot
itself
he
dropped
behind
the
one
protection
at
hand
the
shoulder
of
shale
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
been
making
efforts
to
wriggle
himself
free
from
his
bulky
without
exposing
himself
to
a
at
last
he
had
the
thing
off
it
was
a
tremendous
relief
when
he
thrust
it
out
beside
the
rock
almost
doubling
the
size
of
his
shelter
instantly
there
came
the
crash
of
a
bullet
in
it
and
then
another
he
heard
the
rattle
of
pans
and
wondered
if
his
skillet
would
be
any
good
after
today
for
the
first
time
he
could
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
face
and
stretch
himself
and
also
he
could
think
carrigan
possessed
an
unalterable
faith
in
the
infallibility
of
the
mind
you
can
do
anything
with
the
mind
was
his
code
it
is
better
than
a
good
gun
now
that
he
was
physically
more
at
ease
he
began
reassembling
his
scattered
mental
faculties
who
was
this
stranger
who
was
at
him
with
such
deadly
animosity
from
the
ambush
below
who
another
crash
of
lead
in
tinware
and
steel
put
an
unpleasant
emphasis
to
the
question
it
was
so
close
to
his
head
that
it
made
him
wince
and
now
with
a
wide
area
within
reach
about
him
he
began
scraping
up
the
sand
for
an
added
protection
there
came
a
long
silence
after
that
third
clatter
of
distress
from
his
cooking
utensils
to
david
carrigan
even
in
his
hour
of
deadly
peril
there
was
something
about
it
that
for
an
instant
brought
back
the
glow
of
humor
in
his
eyes
it
was
hot
swelteringly
hot
in
that
packet
of
sand
with
the
unclouded
sun
almost
straight
overhead
he
could
have
tossed
a
pebble
to
where
a
sandpiper
was
cocking
itself
backward
and
forward
its
jerky
movements
accompanied
by
friendly
little
tittering
noises
everything
about
him
seemed
friendly
the
river
rippled
and
murmured
in
cooling
song
just
beyond
the
sandpiper
on
the
other
side
the
still
cooler
forest
was
a
paradise
of
shade
and
contentment
astir
with
subdued
and
hidden
life
it
was
nesting
season
he
heard
the
twitter
of
birds
a
tiny
brown
wood
warbler
fluttered
out
to
the
end
of
a
silvery
birch
limb
and
it
seemed
to
david
that
its
throat
must
surely
burst
with
the
burden
of
its
song
the
little
fellow
brown
body
scarcely
larger
than
a
butternut
was
swelling
up
like
a
round
ball
in
his
effort
to
vanquish
all
other
song
go
to
it
old
man
chuckled
carrigan
go
to
it
the
little
warbler
that
he
might
have
crushed
between
thumb
and
forefinger
gave
him
a
lot
of
courage
then
the
tiny
chorister
stopped
for
breath
in
that
interval
carrigan
listened
to
the
wrangling
of
two
canada
jays
deeper
in
the
timber
chronic
scolds
they
were
never
without
a
grouch
they
were
like
some
people
carrigan
had
known
born
pessimists
always
finding
something
to
complain
about
even
in
their
love
days
and
these
were
love
days
that
was
the
odd
thought
that
came
to
carrigan
as
he
lay
half
on
his
face
his
fingers
slowly
and
cautiously
working
a
loophole
between
his
and
the
rock
they
were
love
days
all
up
and
down
the
big
rivers
where
men
and
women
sang
for
joy
and
children
played
forgetful
of
the
long
hard
days
of
winter
and
in
forest
plain
and
swamp
was
this
spirit
of
love
also
triumphant
over
the
land
it
was
the
mating
season
of
all
feathered
things
in
countless
nests
were
the
peeps
and
twitters
of
new
life
mothers
of
were
teaching
their
children
to
swim
and
fly
from
end
to
end
of
the
forest
world
the
little
children
of
the
silent
places
furred
and
feathered
clawed
and
hoofed
were
learning
the
ways
of
life
nature
yearly
birthday
was
gone
and
the
doors
of
nature
school
wide
open
and
the
tiny
brown
songster
at
the
end
of
his
birch
twig
proclaimed
the
joy
of
it
again
and
challenged
all
the
world
to
beat
him
in
his
adulation
carrigan
found
that
he
could
peer
between
his
pack
and
the
rock
to
where
the
other
warbler
was
singing
and
where
his
enemy
lay
watching
for
the
opportunity
to
kill
it
was
taking
a
chance
if
a
movement
betrayed
his
loophole
his
minutes
were
numbered
but
he
had
worked
cautiously
an
inch
at
a
time
and
was
confident
that
the
beginning
of
his
effort
to
fight
back
was
up
to
the
present
moment
undiscovered
he
believed
that
he
knew
about
where
the
ambushed
man
was
concealed
in
the
edge
of
a
mass
of
balsam
was
a
fallen
cedar
from
behind
the
butt
of
that
cedar
he
was
sure
the
shots
had
come
and
now
even
more
cautiously
than
he
had
made
the
tiny
opening
he
began
to
work
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
through
the
loophole
as
he
did
this
he
was
thinking
of
black
roger
audemard
and
yet
almost
as
quickly
as
suspicion
leaped
into
his
mind
he
told
himself
that
the
thing
was
impossible
it
could
not
be
black
roger
or
one
of
black
roger
friends
behind
the
cedar
log
the
idea
was
inconceivable
when
he
considered
how
carefully
the
secret
of
his
mission
had
been
kept
at
the
landing
he
had
not
even
said
goodby
to
his
best
friends
and
because
black
roger
had
won
through
all
the
preceding
years
carrigan
was
stalking
his
prey
out
of
uniform
there
had
been
nothing
to
betray
him
besides
black
roger
audemard
must
be
at
least
a
thousand
miles
north
unless
something
had
tempted
him
to
come
up
the
rivers
with
the
spring
brigades
if
he
used
logic
at
all
there
was
but
one
conclusion
for
him
to
arrive
at
the
man
in
ambush
was
some
rascally
who
coveted
his
outfit
and
whatever
valuables
he
might
have
about
his
person
a
fourth
smashing
eruption
among
his
comestibles
and
culinary
possessions
came
to
drive
home
the
fact
that
even
that
analysis
of
the
situation
was
absurd
whoever
was
behind
the
rifle
fire
had
small
respect
for
the
contents
of
his
pack
and
he
was
surely
not
in
grievous
need
of
a
good
gun
or
ammunition
a
sticky
mess
of
condensed
cream
was
running
over
carrigan
hand
he
doubted
if
there
was
a
whole
tin
in
his
kit
for
a
few
moments
he
lay
quietly
on
his
face
after
the
fourth
shot
his
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
river
and
on
the
far
side
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
three
canoes
were
moving
swiftly
up
the
slow
current
of
the
stream
the
sunlight
flashed
on
their
wet
sides
the
gleam
of
dripping
paddles
was
like
the
flutter
of
silvery
birds
wings
and
across
the
water
came
an
unintelligible
shout
in
response
to
the
rifle
shot
it
occurred
to
david
that
he
might
make
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
and
shout
back
but
the
distance
was
too
great
for
his
voice
to
carry
its
message
for
help
besides
now
that
he
had
the
added
protection
of
the
pack
he
felt
a
certain
sense
of
humiliation
at
the
thought
of
showing
the
white
feather
a
few
minutes
more
if
all
went
well
and
he
would
settle
for
the
man
behind
the
log
he
continued
again
the
slow
operation
of
worming
his
rifle
barrel
between
the
pack
and
the
rock
the
little
sandpiper
had
discovered
him
and
seemed
interested
in
the
operation
it
had
come
a
dozen
feet
nearer
and
was
perking
its
head
and
seesawing
on
its
long
legs
as
it
watched
with
inquisitive
inspection
the
unusual
manifestation
of
life
behind
the
rock
its
twittering
note
had
changed
to
an
occasional
sharp
and
querulous
cry
carrigan
wanted
to
wring
its
neck
that
cry
told
the
other
fellow
that
he
was
still
alive
and
moving
it
seemed
an
age
before
his
rifle
was
through
and
every
moment
he
expected
another
shot
he
flattened
himself
out
indian
fashion
and
sighted
along
the
barrel
he
was
positive
that
his
enemy
was
watching
yet
he
could
make
out
nothing
that
looked
like
a
head
anywhere
along
the
log
at
one
end
was
a
clump
of
deeper
foliage
he
was
sure
he
saw
a
sudden
slight
movement
there
and
in
the
thrill
of
the
moment
was
tempted
to
send
a
bullet
into
the
heart
of
it
but
he
saved
his
cartridge
he
felt
the
mighty
importance
of
certainty
if
he
fired
once
and
missed
the
advantage
of
his
unsuspected
loophole
would
be
gone
it
would
be
transformed
into
a
deadly
menace
even
as
it
was
if
his
enemy
next
bullet
should
enter
that
way
he
felt
the
discomfort
of
the
thought
and
in
spite
of
himself
a
tremor
of
apprehension
ran
up
his
spine
he
felt
an
even
greater
desire
to
wring
the
neck
of
the
inquisitive
little
sandpiper
the
creature
had
circled
round
squarely
in
front
of
him
and
stood
there
tilting
its
tail
and
bobbing
its
head
as
if
its
one
insane
desire
was
to
look
down
the
length
of
his
rifle
barrel
the
bird
was
giving
him
away
if
the
other
fellow
was
only
half
as
clever
as
his
marksmanship
was
good
suddenly
every
nerve
in
carrigan
body
tightened
he
was
positive
that
he
had
caught
the
outline
of
a
human
head
and
shoulders
in
the
foliage
his
finger
pressed
gently
against
the
trigger
of
his
winchester
before
he
breathed
again
he
would
have
fired
but
a
shot
from
the
foliage
beat
him
out
by
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
that
precious
time
lost
his
enemy
bullet
entered
the
edge
of
his
kit
and
came
through
he
felt
the
shock
of
it
and
in
the
infinitesimal
space
between
the
physical
impact
and
the
mental
effect
of
shock
his
brain
told
him
the
horrible
thing
had
happened
it
was
his
head
his
face
it
was
as
if
he
had
plunged
them
suddenly
into
hot
water
and
what
was
left
of
his
skull
was
filled
with
the
rushing
and
roaring
of
a
flood
he
staggered
up
clutching
his
face
with
both
hands
the
world
about
him
was
twisted
and
black
a
dizzily
revolving
thing
yet
his
still
fighting
mental
vision
pictured
clearly
for
him
a
monstrous
sandpiper
as
big
as
a
house
then
he
toppled
back
on
the
white
sand
his
arms
flung
out
limply
his
face
turned
to
the
ambush
wherein
his
murderer
lay
his
body
was
clear
of
the
rock
and
the
pack
but
there
came
no
other
shot
from
the
thick
clump
of
balsam
nor
for
a
time
was
there
movement
the
wood
warbler
was
cheeping
inquiringly
at
this
sudden
change
in
the
deportment
of
his
friend
behind
the
shoulder
of
shale
the
sandpiper
a
bit
startled
had
gone
back
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
was
running
a
race
with
himself
along
the
wet
sand
and
the
two
quarrelsome
jays
had
brought
their
family
squabble
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
it
was
their
wrangling
that
roused
carrigan
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
dead
it
was
a
thrilling
discovery
that
and
the
fact
that
he
made
out
clearly
a
patch
of
sunlight
in
the
sand
he
did
not
move
but
opened
his
eyes
wider
he
could
see
the
timber
on
a
straight
line
with
his
vision
was
the
thick
clump
of
balsam
and
as
he
looked
the
boughs
parted
and
a
figure
came
out
carrigan
drew
a
deep
breath
he
found
that
it
did
not
hurt
him
he
gripped
the
fingers
of
the
hand
that
was
under
his
body
and
they
closed
on
the
butt
of
his
service
automatic
he
would
win
yet
if
god
gave
him
life
a
few
minutes
longer
his
enemy
advanced
as
he
drew
nearer
carrigan
closed
his
eyes
more
and
more
they
must
be
shut
and
he
must
appear
as
if
dead
when
the
other
came
up
then
when
the
scoundrel
put
down
his
gun
as
he
naturally
would
his
chance
would
be
at
hand
if
a
quiver
of
his
eyes
betrayed
him
he
closed
them
tight
dizziness
began
to
creep
over
him
and
the
fire
in
his
brain
grew
hot
again
he
heard
footsteps
and
they
stopped
in
the
sand
close
beside
him
then
he
heard
a
human
voice
it
did
not
speak
in
words
but
gave
utterance
to
a
strange
and
unnatural
cry
with
a
mighty
effort
carrigan
assembled
his
last
strength
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
brought
himself
up
quickly
but
his
movement
was
slow
painful
the
effort
of
a
man
who
might
be
dying
the
automatic
hung
limply
in
his
hand
its
muzzle
pointing
to
the
sand
he
looked
up
trying
to
swing
into
action
that
mighty
weight
of
his
weapon
and
then
from
his
own
lips
even
in
his
utter
physical
impotence
fell
a
cry
of
wonder
and
amazement
his
enemy
stood
there
in
the
sunlight
staring
down
at
him
with
big
dark
eyes
that
were
filled
with
horror
they
were
not
the
eyes
of
a
man
david
carrigan
in
this
most
astounding
moment
of
his
life
found
himself
looking
up
into
the
face
of
a
woman
iii
for
a
matter
of
twenty
seconds
even
longer
it
seemed
to
carrigan
the
life
of
these
two
was
expressed
in
a
vivid
and
unforgettable
tableau
one
half
of
it
david
saw
the
blue
sky
the
dazzling
sun
the
girl
in
between
the
pistol
dropped
from
his
limp
hand
and
the
weight
of
his
body
tottered
on
the
crook
of
his
mentally
and
physically
he
was
on
the
point
of
collapse
and
yet
in
those
few
moments
every
detail
of
the
picture
was
painted
with
a
brush
of
fire
in
his
brain
the
girl
was
bareheaded
her
face
was
as
white
as
any
face
he
had
ever
seen
living
or
dead
her
eyes
were
like
pools
that
had
caught
the
reflection
of
fire
he
saw
the
sheen
of
her
hair
the
poise
of
her
slender
body
its
shock
stupefaction
horror
he
sensed
these
things
even
as
his
brain
wobbled
dizzily
and
the
larger
part
of
the
picture
began
to
fade
out
of
his
vision
but
her
face
remained
to
the
last
it
grew
clearer
like
a
cameo
framed
in
an
iris
a
beautiful
staring
horrified
face
with
shimmering
tresses
of
hair
blowing
about
it
like
a
veil
he
noticed
the
hair
that
was
partly
undone
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
struggle
of
some
sort
or
had
been
running
fast
against
the
breeze
that
came
up
the
river
he
fought
with
himself
to
hold
that
picture
of
her
to
utter
some
word
make
some
movement
but
the
power
to
see
and
to
live
died
out
of
him
he
sank
back
with
a
queer
sound
in
his
throat
he
did
not
hear
the
answering
cry
from
the
girl
as
she
flung
herself
with
a
quick
little
prayer
for
help
on
her
knees
in
the
soft
white
sand
beside
him
he
felt
no
movement
when
she
raised
his
head
in
her
arm
and
with
her
bare
hand
brushed
back
his
hair
revealing
where
the
bullet
had
struck
him
he
did
not
know
when
she
ran
back
to
the
river
his
first
sensation
was
of
a
cool
and
comforting
something
trickling
over
his
burning
temples
and
his
face
it
was
water
subconsciously
he
knew
that
and
in
the
same
way
he
began
to
think
but
it
was
hard
to
pull
his
thoughts
together
they
persisted
in
hopping
about
like
a
lot
of
in
a
dance
and
just
as
he
got
hold
of
one
and
reached
for
another
the
first
would
slip
away
from
him
he
began
to
get
the
best
of
them
after
a
time
and
he
had
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
say
something
but
his
eyes
and
his
lips
were
sealed
tight
and
to
open
them
a
little
army
of
gnomes
came
out
of
the
darkness
in
the
back
of
his
head
each
of
them
armed
with
a
lever
and
began
prying
with
all
their
might
after
that
came
the
beginning
of
light
and
a
flash
of
consciousness
the
girl
was
working
over
him
he
could
feel
her
and
hear
her
movement
water
was
trickling
over
his
face
then
he
heard
a
voice
close
over
him
saying
something
in
a
sobbing
monotone
which
he
could
not
understand
with
a
mighty
effort
he
opened
his
eyes
thank
le
bon
dieu
you
live
he
heard
the
voice
say
as
if
coming
from
a
long
distance
away
you
live
you
live
tryin
to
he
mumbled
thickly
feeling
suddenly
a
sense
of
great
elation
tryin
he
wanted
to
curse
the
gnomes
for
deserting
him
for
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
with
their
levers
his
eyes
and
his
lips
shut
tight
again
or
at
least
he
thought
they
did
but
he
began
to
sense
things
in
a
curious
sort
of
way
some
one
was
dragging
him
he
could
feel
the
grind
of
sand
under
his
body
there
were
intervals
when
the
dragging
operation
paused
and
then
after
a
long
time
he
seemed
to
hear
more
than
one
voice
there
were
two
sometimes
a
murmur
of
them
and
odd
visions
came
to
him
he
seemed
to
see
the
girl
with
shining
black
hair
and
dark
eyes
and
then
swiftly
she
would
change
into
a
girl
with
hair
like
blazing
gold
this
was
a
different
girl
she
was
not
like
pretty
eyes
as
his
twisted
mind
called
the
other
this
second
vision
that
he
saw
was
like
a
radiant
bit
of
the
sun
her
hair
all
aflame
with
the
fire
of
it
and
her
face
a
different
sort
of
face
he
was
always
glad
when
she
went
away
and
pretty
eyes
came
back
to
david
carrigan
this
interesting
experience
in
his
life
might
have
covered
an
hour
a
day
or
a
month
or
a
year
for
that
matter
for
he
seemed
to
have
had
an
indefinite
association
with
pretty
eyes
he
had
known
her
for
a
long
time
and
very
intimately
it
seemed
yet
he
had
no
memory
of
the
long
fight
in
the
hot
sun
or
of
the
river
or
of
the
singing
warblers
or
of
the
inquisitive
sandpiper
that
had
marked
out
the
line
which
his
enemy
last
bullet
had
traveled
he
had
entered
into
a
new
world
in
which
everything
was
vague
and
unreal
except
that
vision
of
dark
hair
dark
eyes
and
pale
beautiful
face
several
times
he
saw
it
with
marvelous
clearness
and
each
time
he
drifted
away
into
darkness
again
with
the
sound
of
a
voice
growing
fainter
and
fainter
in
his
ears
then
came
a
time
of
utter
chaos
and
soundless
gloom
he
was
in
a
pit
where
even
his
subconscious
self
was
almost
dead
under
a
crushing
oppression
at
last
a
star
began
to
glimmer
in
this
pit
a
star
pale
and
indistinct
and
a
vast
distance
away
but
it
crept
steadily
up
through
the
eternity
of
darkness
and
the
nearer
it
came
the
less
there
was
of
the
blackness
of
night
from
a
star
it
grew
into
a
sun
and
with
the
sun
came
dawn
in
that
dawn
he
heard
the
singing
of
a
bird
and
the
bird
was
just
over
his
head
when
carrigan
opened
his
eyes
and
understanding
came
to
him
he
found
himself
under
the
silver
birch
that
belonged
to
the
wood
warbler
for
a
space
he
did
not
ask
himself
how
he
had
come
there
he
was
looking
at
the
river
and
the
white
strip
of
sand
out
there
were
the
rock
and
his
dunnage
pack
also
his
rifle
instinctively
his
eyes
turned
to
the
balsam
ambush
farther
down
that
too
was
in
a
blaze
of
sunlight
now
but
where
he
lay
or
sat
or
stood
he
was
not
sure
what
he
was
doing
at
that
moment
it
was
shady
and
deliciously
cool
the
green
of
the
cedar
and
spruce
and
balsam
was
close
about
him
inset
with
the
silver
and
gold
of
the
birch
he
discovered
that
he
was
bolstered
up
partly
against
the
trunk
of
this
birch
and
partly
against
a
spruce
sapling
between
these
two
where
his
head
rested
was
a
pile
of
soft
moss
freshly
torn
from
the
earth
and
within
reach
of
him
was
his
own
kit
pail
filled
with
water
he
moved
himself
cautiously
and
raised
a
hand
to
his
head
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
a
bandage
for
a
minute
or
two
after
that
he
sat
without
moving
while
his
amazed
senses
seized
upon
the
significance
of
it
all
in
the
first
place
he
was
alive
but
even
this
fact
of
living
was
less
remarkable
than
the
other
things
that
had
happened
he
remembered
the
final
moments
of
the
unequal
duel
his
enemy
had
got
him
and
that
enemy
was
a
woman
moreover
after
she
had
blown
away
a
part
of
his
head
and
had
him
helpless
in
the
sand
she
had
in
place
of
finishing
him
there
dragged
him
to
this
cool
nook
and
tied
up
his
wound
it
was
hard
for
him
to
believe
but
the
pail
of
water
the
moss
behind
his
shoulders
the
bandage
and
certain
visions
that
were
reforming
themselves
in
his
brain
convinced
him
a
woman
had
shot
him
she
had
worked
like
the
very
devil
to
kill
him
and
afterward
she
had
saved
him
he
grinned
it
was
final
proof
that
his
mind
had
been
playing
tricks
on
him
no
one
but
a
woman
would
have
been
quite
so
unreasonable
a
man
would
have
completed
the
job
he
began
to
look
for
her
up
and
down
the
white
strip
of
sand
and
in
looking
he
saw
the
gray
and
silver
flash
of
the
sandpiper
he
chuckled
for
he
was
exceedingly
comfortable
and
also
exhilaratingly
happy
to
know
that
the
thing
was
over
and
he
was
not
dead
if
the
sandpiper
had
been
a
man
he
would
have
called
him
up
to
shake
hands
with
him
for
if
it
had
been
for
the
bird
getting
squarely
in
front
of
him
and
giving
him
away
there
might
have
been
a
more
horrible
end
to
it
all
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
the
mighty
effort
he
had
made
to
fire
a
shot
into
the
heart
of
the
balsam
ambush
and
perhaps
into
the
heart
of
a
woman
he
reached
for
the
pail
and
drank
deeply
of
the
water
in
it
he
felt
no
pain
his
dizziness
was
gone
his
mind
had
grown
suddenly
clear
and
alert
the
warmth
of
the
water
told
him
almost
instantly
that
it
had
been
taken
from
the
river
some
time
ago
he
observed
the
change
in
sun
and
shadows
with
the
instinct
of
a
man
trained
to
note
details
he
pulled
out
his
watch
it
was
almost
six
more
than
three
hours
had
passed
since
the
sandpiper
had
got
in
front
of
his
gun
he
did
not
attempt
to
rise
to
his
feet
but
scanned
with
slower
and
more
careful
scrutiny
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
the
river
he
had
been
mystified
while
cringing
for
his
life
behind
the
rock
but
he
was
infinitely
more
so
now
greater
desire
he
had
never
had
than
this
which
thrilled
him
in
these
present
minutes
of
his
readjustment
desire
to
look
upon
the
woman
again
and
then
all
at
once
there
came
back
to
him
a
mental
flash
of
the
other
he
remembered
as
if
something
was
coming
back
to
him
out
of
a
dream
how
the
whimsical
twistings
of
his
sick
brain
had
made
him
see
two
faces
instead
of
one
yet
he
knew
that
the
first
picture
of
his
mysterious
assailant
the
picture
painted
in
his
brain
when
he
had
tried
to
raise
his
pistol
was
the
right
one
he
had
seen
her
dark
eyes
aglow
he
had
seen
the
sunlit
sheen
of
her
black
hair
rippling
in
the
wind
he
had
seen
the
white
pallor
in
her
face
the
slimness
of
her
as
she
stood
over
him
in
horror
he
remembered
even
the
clutch
of
her
white
hand
at
her
throat
a
moment
before
she
had
tried
to
kill
him
and
then
he
had
looked
up
and
had
seen
her
like
that
it
must
have
been
some
unaccountable
trick
in
his
brain
that
had
flooded
her
hair
with
golden
fire
at
times
his
eyes
followed
a
furrow
in
the
white
sand
which
led
from
where
he
sat
bolstered
against
the
tree
down
to
his
pack
and
the
rock
it
was
the
trail
made
by
his
body
when
she
had
dragged
him
up
to
the
shelter
and
coolness
of
the
timber
one
of
his
laws
of
physical
care
was
to
keep
himself
trained
down
to
a
hundred
and
sixty
but
he
wondered
how
she
had
dragged
up
even
so
much
as
that
of
dead
weight
it
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
effort
he
could
see
distinctly
three
different
places
in
the
sand
where
she
had
stopped
to
rest
carrigan
had
earned
a
reputation
as
the
expert
analyst
of
n
division
in
delicate
matters
it
was
seldom
that
mcvane
did
not
take
him
into
consultation
he
possessed
an
almost
uncanny
grip
on
the
working
processes
of
a
criminal
mind
and
the
first
rule
he
had
set
down
for
himself
was
to
regard
the
acts
of
omission
rather
than
the
one
outstanding
act
of
commission
but
when
he
proved
to
himself
that
the
chief
actor
in
a
drama
possessed
a
normal
rather
than
a
criminal
mind
he
found
himself
in
the
position
of
checkmate
it
was
a
thrilling
game
and
he
was
frankly
puzzled
now
until
one
after
another
he
added
up
the
sum
total
of
what
had
been
omitted
in
this
instance
of
his
own
personal
adventure
hidden
in
her
ambush
the
woman
who
had
shot
him
had
been
in
both
purpose
and
act
an
assassin
her
determination
had
been
to
kill
him
she
had
disregarded
the
white
flag
with
which
he
had
pleaded
for
mercy
her
marksmanship
was
of
fiendish
cleverness
up
to
her
last
shot
she
had
been
to
all
intent
and
purpose
a
murderess
the
change
had
come
when
she
looked
down
upon
him
bleeding
and
helpless
in
the
sand
undoubtedly
she
had
thought
he
was
dying
but
why
when
she
saw
his
eyes
open
a
little
later
had
she
cried
out
her
gratitude
to
god
what
had
worked
the
sudden
transformation
in
her
why
had
she
labored
to
save
the
life
she
had
so
atrociously
coveted
a
minute
before
if
his
assailant
had
been
a
man
carrigan
would
have
found
an
answer
for
he
was
not
robbed
and
therefore
robbery
was
not
a
motif
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
he
would
have
told
himself
an
error
in
visual
judgment
but
the
fact
that
in
his
analysis
he
was
dealing
with
a
woman
made
his
answer
only
partly
satisfying
he
could
not
disassociate
himself
from
her
eyes
their
beauty
their
horror
the
way
they
had
looked
at
him
it
was
as
if
a
sudden
revulsion
had
come
over
her
as
if
looking
down
upon
her
bleeding
handiwork
the
woman
soul
in
her
had
revolted
and
with
that
revulsion
had
come
repentance
repentance
and
pity
that
thought
carrigan
would
be
just
like
a
woman
and
especially
a
woman
with
eyes
like
hers
this
left
him
but
two
conclusions
to
choose
from
either
there
had
been
a
mistake
and
the
woman
had
shown
both
horror
and
desire
to
amend
when
she
discovered
it
or
a
too
agent
of
black
roger
audemard
had
waylaid
him
in
the
heart
of
the
white
strip
of
sand
the
sun
was
another
hour
lower
in
the
sky
when
carrigan
assured
himself
in
a
series
of
cautious
experiments
that
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
stand
upon
his
feet
in
his
pack
were
a
number
of
things
he
wanted
his
blankets
for
instance
a
steel
mirror
and
the
thermometer
in
his
medical
kit
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
bit
anxious
about
himself
there
were
sharp
pains
back
of
his
eyes
his
face
was
hot
and
he
was
developing
an
unhealthy
appetite
for
water
it
was
fever
and
he
knew
what
fever
meant
in
this
sort
of
thing
when
one
was
alone
he
had
given
up
hope
of
the
woman
return
it
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
her
to
come
back
after
her
furious
attempt
to
kill
him
she
had
bandaged
him
bolstered
him
up
placed
water
beside
him
and
had
then
left
him
to
work
out
the
rest
of
his
salvation
alone
but
why
the
deuce
had
she
brought
up
his
pack
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
began
to
work
himself
toward
it
slowly
he
found
that
the
movement
caused
him
pain
and
that
with
this
pain
if
he
persisted
in
movement
there
was
a
synchronous
rise
of
nausea
the
two
seemed
to
work
in
a
sort
of
unity
but
his
medicine
case
was
important
now
and
his
blankets
and
his
rifle
if
he
hoped
to
signal
help
that
might
chance
to
pass
on
the
river
a
foot
at
a
time
a
yard
at
a
time
he
made
his
way
down
into
the
sand
his
fingers
dug
into
the
footprints
of
the
mysterious
he
approved
of
their
size
they
were
small
and
narrow
scarcely
longer
than
the
palm
and
fingers
of
his
hand
and
they
were
made
by
shoes
instead
of
moccasins
it
seemed
an
interminable
time
to
him
before
he
reached
his
pack
when
he
got
there
a
pendulum
seemed
swinging
back
and
forth
inside
his
head
beating
against
his
skull
he
lay
down
with
his
pack
for
a
pillow
intending
to
rest
for
a
spell
but
the
minutes
added
themselves
one
on
top
of
another
the
sun
slipped
behind
clouds
banking
in
the
west
it
grew
cooler
while
within
him
he
was
consumed
by
a
burning
thirst
he
could
hear
the
ripple
of
running
water
the
laughter
of
it
among
pebbles
a
few
yards
away
and
the
river
itself
became
even
more
desirable
than
his
medicine
case
or
his
blankets
or
his
rifle
the
song
of
it
inviting
and
tempting
him
blotted
thought
of
the
other
things
out
of
his
mind
and
he
continued
his
journey
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
in
his
head
becoming
harder
but
the
sound
of
the
river
growing
nearer
at
last
he
came
to
the
wet
sand
and
fell
on
his
face
and
drank
after
this
he
had
no
great
desire
to
go
back
he
rolled
himself
over
so
that
his
face
was
turned
up
to
the
sky
under
him
the
wet
sand
was
soft
and
it
was
comfortingly
cool
the
fire
in
his
head
died
out
he
could
hear
new
sounds
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
evening
sounds
only
weak
little
twitters
came
from
the
wood
warblers
driven
to
silence
by
thickening
gloom
in
the
densely
canopied
balsams
and
cedars
and
frightened
by
the
first
low
hoots
of
the
owls
there
was
a
crash
not
far
distant
probably
a
porcupine
waddling
through
brush
on
his
way
for
a
drink
or
perhaps
it
was
a
thirsty
deer
or
a
bear
coming
out
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
dead
fish
carrigan
loved
that
sort
of
sound
even
when
a
pendulum
was
beating
back
and
forth
in
his
head
it
was
like
medicine
to
him
and
he
lay
with
eyes
his
ears
picking
up
one
after
another
the
voices
that
marked
the
change
from
day
to
night
he
heard
the
cry
of
a
loon
its
softer
chuckling
note
of
honeymoon
days
from
across
the
river
came
a
cry
that
was
half
howl
half
bark
carrigan
knew
that
it
was
coyote
and
not
wolf
a
coyote
whose
breed
had
wandered
hundreds
of
miles
north
of
the
prairie
country
the
gloom
gathered
in
and
yet
it
was
not
darkness
as
the
darkness
of
night
is
known
a
thousand
miles
south
it
was
the
dusky
twilight
of
day
where
the
sun
rises
at
three
in
the
morning
and
still
throws
its
ruddy
light
in
the
western
sky
at
nine
at
night
where
the
poplar
buds
unfold
themselves
into
leaf
before
one
very
eyes
where
strawberries
are
green
in
the
morning
and
red
in
the
afternoon
where
a
little
later
one
could
read
newspaper
print
until
midnight
by
the
glow
of
the
sun
and
between
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
that
sun
there
would
be
from
eighteen
to
twenty
hours
of
day
it
was
evening
time
in
the
wonderland
of
the
north
a
wonderland
hard
and
frozen
and
ridden
by
pain
and
death
in
winter
but
a
paradise
upon
earth
in
this
month
of
june
the
beauty
of
it
filled
carrigan
soul
even
as
he
lay
on
his
back
in
the
damp
sand
far
south
of
him
steam
and
steel
were
coming
and
the
world
would
soon
know
that
it
was
easy
to
grow
wheat
at
the
arctic
circle
that
cucumbers
grew
to
half
the
size
of
a
man
arm
that
flowers
smothered
the
land
and
berries
turned
it
scarlet
and
black
he
had
dreaded
these
days
days
of
what
he
called
the
great
discovery
the
time
when
a
crowded
civilization
would
at
last
understand
how
the
fruits
of
the
earth
leaped
up
to
the
call
of
twenty
hours
of
sun
each
day
even
though
that
earth
itself
was
eternally
frozen
if
one
went
down
under
its
surface
four
feet
with
a
pick
and
shovel
tonight
the
gloom
came
earlier
because
of
the
clouds
in
the
west
it
was
very
still
even
the
breeze
had
ceased
to
come
from
up
the
river
and
as
carrigan
listened
exulting
in
the
thought
that
the
coolness
of
the
wet
sand
was
drawing
the
fever
from
him
he
heard
another
sound
at
first
he
thought
it
was
the
splashing
of
a
fish
but
after
that
it
came
again
and
still
again
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
steady
and
rhythmic
dip
of
paddles
a
thrill
shot
through
him
and
he
raised
himself
to
his
elbow
dusk
covered
the
river
and
he
could
not
see
but
he
heard
low
voices
as
the
paddles
dipped
and
after
a
little
he
knew
that
one
of
these
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
his
heart
gave
a
big
jump
she
is
coming
back
he
whispered
to
himself
she
is
coming
back
iv
carrigan
first
impulse
sudden
as
the
thrill
that
leaped
through
him
was
to
cry
out
to
the
occupants
of
the
unseen
canoe
words
were
on
his
lips
but
he
forced
them
back
they
could
not
miss
him
could
not
get
beyond
the
reach
of
his
voice
and
he
waited
after
all
there
might
be
profit
in
a
reasonable
degree
of
caution
he
crept
back
toward
his
rifle
sensing
the
fact
that
movement
no
longer
gave
him
very
great
distress
at
the
same
time
he
lost
no
sound
from
the
river
the
voices
were
silent
and
the
dip
dip
dip
of
paddles
was
approaching
softly
and
with
extreme
caution
at
last
he
could
barely
hear
the
trickle
of
them
yet
he
knew
the
canoe
was
coming
steadily
nearer
there
was
a
suspicious
secretiveness
in
its
approach
perhaps
the
lady
with
the
beautiful
eyes
and
the
glistening
hair
had
changed
her
mind
again
and
was
returning
to
put
an
end
to
him
the
thought
sharpened
his
vision
he
saw
a
thin
shadow
a
little
darker
than
the
gloom
of
the
river
it
grew
into
shape
something
grated
lightly
upon
sand
and
pebbles
and
then
he
heard
the
guarded
plash
of
feet
in
shallow
water
and
saw
some
one
pulling
the
canoe
up
higher
a
second
figure
joined
the
first
they
advanced
a
few
paces
and
stopped
in
a
moment
a
voice
called
softly
carrigan
there
was
an
anxious
note
in
the
voice
but
carrigan
held
his
tongue
and
then
he
heard
the
woman
say
it
was
here
bateese
i
am
sure
of
it
there
was
more
than
anxiety
in
her
voice
now
her
words
trembled
with
distress
bateese
if
he
is
dead
he
is
up
there
close
to
the
trees
but
he
is
dead
said
carrigan
raising
himself
a
little
he
is
here
behind
the
rock
again
in
a
moment
she
had
run
to
where
he
was
lying
his
hand
clutching
the
cold
barrel
of
the
pistol
which
he
had
found
in
the
sand
his
white
face
looking
up
at
her
again
he
found
himself
staring
into
the
glow
of
her
eyes
and
in
that
pale
light
which
precedes
the
coming
of
stars
and
moon
the
fancy
struck
him
that
she
was
lovelier
than
in
the
full
radiance
of
the
sun
he
heard
a
throbbing
note
in
her
throat
and
then
she
was
down
on
her
knees
at
his
side
leaning
close
over
him
her
hands
groping
at
his
shoulders
her
quick
breath
betraying
how
swiftly
her
heart
was
beating
you
are
not
hurt
badly
she
cried
i
do
know
replied
david
you
made
a
perfect
shot
i
think
a
part
of
my
head
is
gone
at
least
you
shot
away
my
balance
because
i
ca
stand
on
my
feet
her
hand
touched
his
face
remaining
there
for
an
instant
and
the
palm
of
it
pressed
his
forehead
it
was
like
the
touch
of
cool
velvet
he
thought
then
she
called
to
the
man
named
bateese
he
made
carrigan
think
of
a
huge
chimpanzee
as
he
came
near
because
of
the
shortness
of
his
body
and
the
length
of
his
arms
in
the
half
light
he
might
have
been
a
huge
animal
a
hulking
creature
of
some
sort
walking
upright
carrigan
fingers
closed
more
tightly
on
the
butt
of
his
automatic
the
woman
began
to
talk
swiftly
in
a
patois
of
french
and
cree
david
caught
the
gist
of
it
she
was
telling
bateese
to
carry
him
to
the
canoe
and
to
be
very
careful
because
was
badly
hurt
it
was
his
head
she
emphasized
bateese
must
be
careful
of
his
head
david
slipped
his
pistol
into
its
holster
as
bateese
bent
over
him
he
tried
to
smile
at
the
woman
to
thank
her
for
her
solicitude
after
having
nearly
killed
him
there
was
an
increasing
glow
in
the
night
and
he
began
to
see
her
more
plainly
out
on
the
middle
of
the
river
was
a
silvery
bar
of
light
the
moon
was
coming
up
a
little
pale
as
yet
but
triumphant
in
the
fact
that
clouds
had
blotted
out
the
sun
an
hour
before
his
time
between
this
bar
of
light
and
himself
he
saw
the
head
of
bateese
it
was
a
wild
head
bound
round
the
forehead
with
a
huge
hudson
bay
kerchief
bateese
might
have
been
old
jack
ketch
himself
bending
over
to
give
the
final
twist
to
a
victim
neck
his
long
arms
slipped
under
david
gently
and
without
effort
he
raised
him
to
his
feet
and
then
as
easily
as
he
might
have
lifted
a
child
he
trundled
him
up
in
his
arms
and
walked
off
with
him
over
the
sand
carrigan
had
not
expected
this
he
was
a
little
shocked
and
felt
also
the
impropriety
of
the
thing
the
idea
of
being
lugged
off
like
a
baby
was
embarrassing
even
in
the
presence
of
the
one
who
had
deliberately
put
him
in
his
present
condition
bateese
did
the
thing
with
such
beastly
ease
it
was
as
if
he
was
no
more
than
a
small
boy
a
runt
with
no
weight
whatever
and
bateese
was
a
man
he
would
have
preferred
to
stagger
along
on
his
own
feet
or
creep
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
he
grunted
as
much
to
bateese
on
the
way
to
the
canoe
he
felt
at
the
same
time
that
the
situation
owed
him
something
more
of
discussion
and
explanation
even
now
after
half
killing
him
the
woman
was
taking
a
rather
advantage
of
him
she
might
at
least
have
assured
him
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
was
sorry
but
she
did
not
speak
to
him
again
she
said
nothing
more
to
bateese
and
when
the
deposited
him
in
the
midship
part
of
the
canoe
facing
the
bow
she
stood
back
in
silence
then
bateese
brought
his
pack
and
rifle
and
wedged
the
pack
in
behind
him
so
that
he
could
sit
upright
after
that
without
pausing
to
ask
permission
he
picked
up
the
woman
and
carried
her
through
the
shallow
water
to
the
bow
saving
her
the
wetting
of
her
feet
as
she
turned
to
find
her
paddle
her
face
was
toward
david
and
for
a
moment
she
was
looking
at
him
do
you
mind
telling
me
who
you
are
and
where
we
are
going
he
asked
i
am
jeanne
boulain
she
said
my
brigade
is
down
the
river
carrigan
he
was
amazed
at
the
promptness
of
her
confession
for
as
one
of
the
working
factors
of
the
long
arm
of
the
police
he
accepted
it
as
that
he
had
scarcely
expected
her
to
divulge
her
name
after
the
way
in
which
she
had
attempted
to
kill
him
and
she
had
spoken
quite
calmly
of
my
brigade
he
had
heard
of
the
boulain
brigade
it
was
a
name
associated
with
chipewyan
as
he
remembered
it
or
fort
mcmurray
he
was
not
sure
just
where
the
boulain
scows
had
traded
freight
with
the
craft
until
this
year
he
was
positive
they
had
not
come
as
far
south
as
athabasca
landing
boulain
boulain
the
name
repeated
itself
over
and
over
in
his
mind
bateese
shoved
off
the
canoe
and
the
woman
paddle
dipped
in
and
out
of
the
water
beginning
to
shimmer
in
moonlight
but
he
could
not
for
a
time
get
himself
beyond
the
pounding
of
that
name
in
his
brain
it
was
not
merely
that
he
had
heard
the
name
before
there
was
something
significant
about
it
something
that
made
him
grope
back
in
his
memory
of
things
boulain
he
whispered
it
to
himself
his
eyes
on
the
slender
figure
of
the
woman
ahead
of
him
swaying
gently
to
the
steady
sweep
of
the
paddle
in
her
hands
yet
he
could
think
of
nothing
a
feeling
of
irritation
swept
over
him
disgust
at
his
own
mental
impotency
and
the
dizzying
sickness
was
brewing
in
his
head
again
i
have
heard
that
name
somewhere
before
he
said
there
was
a
space
of
only
five
or
six
feet
between
them
and
he
spoke
with
studied
distinctness
possibly
you
have
her
voice
was
exquisite
clear
as
the
note
of
a
bird
yet
so
soft
and
low
that
she
seemed
scarcely
to
have
spoken
and
it
was
carrigan
thought
criminally
evasive
under
the
circumstances
he
wanted
her
to
turn
round
and
say
something
he
wanted
first
of
all
to
ask
her
why
she
had
tried
to
kill
him
it
was
his
right
to
demand
an
explanation
and
it
was
his
duty
to
get
her
back
to
the
landing
where
the
law
would
ask
an
accounting
of
her
she
must
know
that
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
she
could
have
learned
his
name
and
that
was
by
prying
into
his
identification
papers
while
he
was
unconscious
therefore
she
not
only
knew
his
name
but
also
that
he
was
sergeant
carrigan
of
the
royal
northwest
mounted
police
in
spite
of
all
this
she
was
apparently
not
very
deeply
concerned
she
was
not
frightened
and
she
did
not
appear
to
be
even
slightly
excited
he
leaned
nearer
to
her
the
movement
sending
a
sharp
pain
between
his
eyes
it
almost
drew
a
cry
from
him
but
he
forced
himself
to
speak
without
betraying
it
you
tried
to
murder
me
and
almost
succeeded
have
you
anything
to
say
not
now
except
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
i
am
sorry
but
you
must
not
talk
you
must
remain
quiet
i
am
afraid
your
skull
is
fractured
afraid
his
skull
was
fractured
and
she
expressed
her
fear
in
the
casual
way
she
might
have
spoken
of
a
toothache
he
leaned
back
against
his
dunnage
sack
and
closed
his
eyes
probably
she
was
right
these
fits
of
dizziness
and
nausea
were
suspicious
they
made
him
and
filled
him
with
a
desire
to
crumple
up
somewhere
he
was
conscious
of
this
and
of
his
fight
against
the
weakness
but
in
those
moments
when
he
felt
better
and
his
head
was
clear
of
pain
he
had
not
seriously
thought
of
a
fractured
skull
if
she
believed
it
why
did
she
not
treat
him
a
bit
more
considerately
bateese
with
that
strength
of
an
ox
in
his
arms
had
no
use
for
her
assistance
with
the
paddle
she
might
at
least
have
sat
facing
him
even
if
she
refused
to
explain
matters
more
definitely
a
mistake
she
called
it
and
she
was
sorry
for
him
she
had
made
those
statements
in
a
way
but
with
a
voice
that
was
like
music
she
had
spoken
perfect
english
but
in
her
words
were
the
inflection
and
velvety
softness
of
the
french
blood
which
must
be
running
red
in
her
veins
and
her
name
was
jeanne
boulain
with
eyes
closed
carrigan
called
himself
an
idiot
for
thinking
of
these
things
at
the
present
time
primarily
he
was
a
out
on
important
duty
and
here
was
duty
right
at
hand
a
thousand
miles
south
of
black
roger
audemard
the
wholesale
murderer
he
was
after
he
would
have
sworn
on
his
life
that
black
roger
had
never
gone
at
a
killing
more
deliberately
than
this
same
jeanne
boulain
had
gone
after
him
behind
the
rock
now
that
it
was
all
over
and
he
was
alive
she
was
taking
him
somewhere
as
coolly
and
as
unexcitedly
as
though
they
were
returning
from
a
picnic
carrigan
shut
his
eyes
tighter
and
wondered
if
he
was
thinking
straight
he
believed
he
was
badly
hurt
but
he
was
as
strongly
convinced
that
his
mind
was
clear
and
he
lay
quietly
with
his
head
against
the
pack
his
eyes
closed
waiting
for
the
coolness
of
the
river
to
drive
his
nausea
away
again
he
sensed
rather
than
felt
the
swift
movement
of
the
canoe
there
was
no
perceptible
tremor
to
its
progress
the
current
and
a
perfect
craftsmanship
with
the
paddles
were
carrying
it
along
at
six
or
seven
miles
an
hour
he
heard
the
rippling
of
water
that
at
times
was
almost
like
the
tinkling
of
tiny
bells
and
more
and
more
became
that
sound
as
he
listened
to
it
it
struck
a
certain
note
for
him
and
to
that
note
another
added
itself
until
in
the
purling
rhythm
of
the
river
he
caught
the
murmuring
monotone
of
a
name
boulain
boulain
boulain
the
name
became
an
obsession
it
meant
something
and
he
knew
what
it
meant
if
he
could
only
whip
his
memory
back
into
harness
again
but
that
was
impossible
now
when
he
tried
to
concentrate
his
mental
faculties
his
head
ached
terrifically
he
dipped
his
hand
into
the
water
and
held
it
over
his
eyes
for
half
an
hour
after
that
he
did
not
raise
his
head
in
that
time
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
bateese
or
jeanne
boulain
for
the
forest
people
it
was
not
an
hour
in
which
to
talk
the
moon
had
risen
swiftly
and
the
stars
were
out
where
there
had
been
gloom
the
world
was
now
a
flood
of
gold
and
silver
light
at
first
carrigan
allowed
this
to
filter
between
his
fingers
then
he
opened
his
eyes
he
felt
more
evenly
balanced
again
straight
in
front
of
him
was
jeanne
boulain
the
curtain
of
dusk
had
risen
from
between
them
and
she
was
full
in
the
radiance
of
the
moon
she
was
no
longer
paddling
but
was
looking
straight
ahead
to
cardigan
her
figure
was
exquisitely
girlish
as
he
saw
it
now
she
was
bareheaded
as
he
had
seen
tier
first
and
her
hair
hung
down
her
back
like
a
shimmering
mass
of
velvety
sable
in
the
glow
something
told
carrigan
she
was
going
to
turn
her
face
in
his
direction
and
he
dropped
his
hand
over
his
eyes
again
leaving
a
space
between
the
fingers
he
was
right
in
his
guess
she
fronted
the
moon
looking
at
him
closely
rather
anxiously
he
thought
she
even
leaned
a
little
toward
him
that
she
might
see
more
clearly
then
she
turned
and
resumed
her
paddling
carrigan
was
a
bit
elated
probably
she
had
looked
at
him
a
number
of
times
like
that
during
the
past
and
she
was
disturbed
she
was
worrying
about
him
the
thought
of
being
a
murderess
was
beginning
to
frighten
her
in
spite
of
the
beauty
of
her
eyes
and
hair
and
the
slim
witchery
of
her
body
he
had
no
sympathy
for
her
he
told
himself
that
he
would
give
a
year
of
his
life
to
have
her
down
at
barracks
this
minute
he
would
never
forget
that
of
an
hour
behind
the
rock
not
if
he
lived
to
be
a
hundred
and
if
he
did
live
she
was
going
to
pay
even
if
she
was
lovelier
than
venus
and
all
the
graces
combined
he
felt
irritated
with
himself
that
he
should
have
observed
in
such
a
silly
way
the
sable
glow
of
her
hair
in
the
moonlight
and
her
eyes
what
the
deuce
did
prettiness
matter
in
the
present
situation
the
sister
of
fanchet
the
mail
robber
was
beautiful
but
her
beauty
had
failed
to
save
fanchet
the
law
had
taken
him
in
spite
of
the
tears
in
carmin
fanchet
big
black
eyes
and
in
that
particular
instance
he
was
the
law
and
carmin
fanchet
was
pretty
deucedly
pretty
even
the
old
man
heart
had
been
stirred
by
her
loveliness
a
shame
he
had
said
to
carrigan
a
shame
but
the
rascally
fanchet
was
hung
by
the
neck
until
he
was
dead
carrigan
drew
himself
up
slowly
until
he
was
sitting
erect
he
wondered
what
jeanne
boulain
would
say
if
he
told
her
about
carmin
but
there
was
a
big
gulf
between
the
names
fanchet
and
boulain
the
fanchets
had
come
from
the
dance
halls
of
alaska
they
were
bad
both
of
them
at
least
so
they
had
judged
carmin
fanchet
along
with
her
brother
and
boulain
his
hand
in
dropping
to
his
side
fell
upon
the
butt
of
his
pistol
neither
bateese
nor
the
girl
had
thought
of
disarming
him
it
was
careless
of
them
unless
bateese
was
keeping
a
good
eye
on
him
from
behind
a
new
sort
of
thrill
crept
into
carrigan
blood
he
began
to
see
where
he
had
made
a
huge
error
in
not
playing
his
part
more
cleverly
it
was
this
girl
jeanne
who
had
shot
him
it
was
jeanne
who
had
stood
over
him
in
that
last
moment
when
he
had
made
an
effort
to
use
his
pistol
it
was
she
who
had
tried
to
murder
him
and
who
had
turned
when
it
came
to
finishing
the
job
but
his
knowledge
of
these
things
he
should
have
kept
from
her
then
when
the
proper
moment
came
he
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
act
even
now
it
might
be
possible
to
cover
his
blunder
he
leaned
toward
her
again
determined
to
make
the
effort
i
want
to
ask
your
pardon
he
said
may
i
his
voice
startled
her
it
was
as
if
the
stinging
tip
of
a
had
touched
her
bare
neck
he
was
smiling
when
she
turned
in
her
face
and
eyes
was
a
relief
which
she
made
no
effort
to
repress
you
thought
i
might
be
dead
he
laughed
softly
i
not
miss
jeanne
i
very
much
alive
again
it
was
that
accursed
fever
and
i
want
to
ask
your
pardon
i
think
i
know
that
i
accused
you
of
shooting
me
it
impossible
i
could
think
of
it
in
my
clear
mind
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
know
the
rascally
who
me
like
that
and
it
was
you
who
came
in
time
and
frightened
him
away
and
saved
my
life
will
you
forgive
me
and
accept
my
gratitude
there
came
into
the
glowing
eyes
of
the
girl
a
reflection
of
his
own
smile
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
the
corners
of
her
mouth
tremble
a
little
before
she
answered
him
i
am
glad
you
are
feeling
better
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
for
saying
such
beastly
things
to
you
she
was
lovely
when
she
smiled
and
she
was
smiling
at
him
now
if
you
want
to
be
forgiven
for
lying
yes
she
said
i
forgive
you
that
because
it
is
sometimes
your
business
to
lie
it
was
i
who
tried
to
kill
you
and
you
know
it
but
you
must
not
talk
it
is
not
good
for
you
bateese
will
you
tell
not
to
talk
carrigan
heard
a
movement
behind
him
you
will
stop
ze
talk
or
i
brak
hees
head
wit
ze
paddle
in
my
han
came
the
voice
of
bateese
close
to
his
shoulder
do
i
mak
ze
word
plain
so
compren
i
get
you
old
man
grunted
carrigan
i
get
you
both
and
he
leaned
back
against
his
staring
again
at
the
witching
slimness
of
the
lovely
jeanne
boulain
as
she
calmly
resumed
her
paddling
in
the
bow
of
the
canoe
v
in
the
few
minutes
following
the
efficient
and
unexpected
warning
of
bateese
an
entirely
new
element
of
interest
entered
into
the
situation
for
david
carrigan
he
had
more
than
once
assured
himself
that
he
had
made
a
success
of
his
profession
of
not
because
he
was
brighter
than
the
other
fellow
but
largely
because
he
possessed
a
sense
of
humor
and
no
vanities
to
prick
he
was
in
the
game
because
he
loved
the
adventure
of
it
he
was
loyal
to
his
duty
but
he
was
not
a
worshipper
of
the
law
nor
did
he
covet
the
small
monthly
stipend
of
dollars
and
cents
that
came
of
his
allegiance
to
it
as
a
member
of
the
scarlet
police
and
especially
of
n
division
he
felt
the
pulse
and
thrill
of
life
as
he
loved
to
live
it
and
the
greatest
of
all
thrills
came
when
he
was
after
a
man
as
clever
as
himself
or
cleverer
this
time
it
was
a
woman
or
a
girl
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
which
she
was
her
voice
low
and
musical
her
poise
and
the
tranquil
and
unexcitable
loveliness
of
her
face
had
made
him
at
first
register
her
as
a
woman
yet
as
he
looked
at
the
slim
girlishness
of
her
figure
in
the
bow
of
the
canoe
accentuated
by
the
soft
sheen
of
her
partly
unbraided
hair
he
wondered
if
she
were
eighteen
or
thirty
it
would
take
the
clear
light
of
day
to
tell
him
but
whether
a
girl
or
a
woman
she
had
handled
him
so
cleverly
that
the
unpleasantness
of
his
earlier
experience
began
to
give
way
slowly
to
an
admiration
for
her
capability
he
wondered
what
the
superintendent
of
n
division
would
say
if
he
could
see
black
roger
audemard
latest
trailer
propped
up
here
in
the
center
of
the
canoe
the
prisoner
of
a
but
dangerously
efficient
bit
of
feminine
loveliness
and
a
bateese
had
confirmed
the
suspicion
that
he
was
a
prisoner
even
though
this
mysterious
pair
were
bent
on
saving
his
life
why
it
was
their
desire
to
keep
life
in
him
when
only
a
few
hours
ago
one
of
them
had
tried
to
kill
him
was
question
which
only
the
future
could
answer
he
did
not
bother
himself
with
that
problem
now
the
present
was
altogether
too
interesting
and
there
was
but
little
doubt
that
other
developments
equally
important
were
close
at
hand
the
attitude
of
both
jeanne
boulain
and
her
henchman
was
sufficient
evidence
of
that
bateese
had
threatened
to
knock
his
head
off
and
he
could
have
sworn
that
the
girl
or
woman
had
smiled
her
approbation
of
the
threat
yet
he
held
no
grudge
against
bateese
an
odd
sort
of
liking
for
the
man
began
to
possess
him
just
as
he
found
himself
powerless
to
resist
an
ingrowing
admiration
for
the
existence
of
black
roger
audemard
became
with
him
a
sort
of
indefinite
reality
black
roger
was
a
long
way
off
and
bateese
were
very
near
he
began
thinking
of
her
as
he
liked
the
name
it
was
the
boulain
part
of
it
that
worked
in
him
with
an
irritating
insistence
for
the
first
time
since
the
canoe
journey
had
begun
he
looked
beyond
the
darkly
glowing
head
and
the
slender
figure
in
the
bow
it
was
a
splendid
night
ahead
of
him
the
river
was
like
a
rippling
sheet
of
molten
silver
on
both
sides
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
rose
the
walls
of
the
forest
like
oriental
tapestries
the
sky
seemed
near
loaded
with
stars
and
the
moon
rising
with
almost
perceptible
movement
toward
the
zenith
had
changed
from
red
to
a
mellow
gold
carrigan
soul
always
rose
to
this
glory
of
the
northern
light
youth
and
vigor
he
told
himself
must
always
exist
under
those
unpolluted
lights
of
the
upper
worlds
the
unspeaking
things
which
had
told
him
more
than
he
had
ever
learned
from
the
mouths
of
other
men
they
stood
for
his
religion
his
faith
his
belief
in
the
existence
of
things
greater
than
the
insignificant
spark
which
animated
his
own
body
he
appreciated
them
most
when
there
was
stillness
and
tonight
it
was
still
it
was
so
quiet
that
the
trickling
of
the
paddles
was
like
subdued
music
from
the
forest
there
came
no
sound
yet
he
knew
there
was
life
there
questing
life
life
that
moved
on
velvety
wing
and
padded
foot
just
as
he
and
and
the
bateese
were
moving
in
the
canoe
to
have
called
out
in
this
hour
would
have
taken
an
effort
for
a
supreme
and
invisible
hand
seemed
to
have
commanded
stillness
upon
the
earth
and
then
there
came
droning
upon
his
ears
a
break
in
the
stillness
and
as
he
listened
the
shores
closed
slowly
in
narrowing
the
channel
until
he
saw
giant
masses
of
gray
rock
replacing
the
thick
verdure
of
balsam
spruce
and
cedar
the
moaning
grew
louder
and
the
rocks
climbed
skyward
until
they
hung
in
great
cliffs
there
could
be
but
one
meaning
to
this
sudden
change
they
were
close
to
le
rapide
the
holy
ghost
rapids
carrigan
was
astonished
that
day
at
noon
he
had
believed
the
holy
ghost
to
be
twenty
or
thirty
miles
below
him
now
they
were
at
its
mouth
and
he
saw
that
bateese
and
jeanne
boulain
were
quietly
and
unexcitedly
preparing
to
run
that
vicious
stretch
of
water
unconsciously
he
gripped
the
gunwales
of
the
canoe
with
both
hands
as
the
sound
of
the
rapids
grew
into
low
and
sullen
thunder
in
the
moonlight
ahead
he
could
see
the
rock
walls
closing
in
until
the
channel
was
crushed
between
two
precipitous
ramparts
and
the
moon
and
stars
sending
their
glow
between
those
walls
lighted
up
a
frothing
path
of
water
that
made
carrigan
hold
his
breath
he
would
have
portaged
this
place
even
in
broad
day
he
looked
at
the
girl
in
the
bow
the
slender
figure
was
a
little
more
erect
the
glowing
head
held
a
little
higher
in
those
moments
he
would
have
liked
to
see
her
face
the
wonderful
something
that
must
be
in
her
eyes
as
she
rode
fearlessly
into
the
teeth
of
the
menace
ahead
for
he
could
see
that
she
was
not
afraid
that
she
was
facing
this
thing
with
a
sort
of
exultation
that
there
was
something
about
it
which
thrilled
her
until
every
drop
of
blood
in
her
body
was
racing
with
the
impetus
of
the
stream
itself
eddies
of
wind
puffing
out
from
between
the
chasm
walls
tossed
her
loose
hair
about
her
back
in
a
glistening
veil
he
saw
a
long
strand
of
it
trailing
over
the
edge
of
the
canoe
into
the
water
it
made
him
shiver
and
he
wanted
to
cry
out
to
bateese
that
he
was
a
fool
for
risking
her
life
like
this
he
forgot
that
he
was
the
one
helpless
individual
in
the
canoe
and
that
an
upset
would
mean
the
end
for
him
while
bateese
and
his
companion
might
still
fight
on
his
thought
and
his
vision
were
focused
on
the
girl
and
what
lay
straight
ahead
a
mass
of
froth
like
a
windrow
of
snow
rose
up
before
them
and
the
canoe
plunged
into
it
with
the
swiftness
of
a
shot
it
spattered
in
his
face
and
blinded
him
for
an
instant
then
they
were
out
of
it
and
he
fancied
he
heard
a
note
of
laughter
from
the
girl
in
the
bow
in
the
next
breath
he
called
himself
a
fool
for
imagining
that
for
the
run
was
dead
ahead
and
the
girl
became
vibrant
with
life
her
paddle
flashing
in
and
out
while
from
her
lips
came
sharp
clear
cries
which
brought
from
eateese
bellows
of
response
the
walls
shot
past
inundations
rose
and
plunged
under
them
black
rocks
whipped
with
caps
of
foam
raced
with
the
speed
of
living
things
the
roar
became
a
drowning
voice
and
then
as
if
outreached
by
the
wings
of
a
swifter
thing
dropped
suddenly
behind
them
smoother
water
lay
ahead
the
channel
broadened
moonlight
filled
it
with
a
clearer
radiance
and
carrigan
saw
the
girl
hair
glistening
wet
and
her
arms
dripping
for
the
first
time
he
turned
about
and
faced
bateese
the
was
grinning
like
a
cheshire
cat
you
a
confoundedly
queer
pair
grunted
carrigan
and
he
turned
about
again
to
find
jeanne
boulain
as
unconcerned
as
though
running
the
holy
ghost
rapids
in
the
glow
of
the
moon
was
nothing
more
than
a
matter
of
play
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
keep
his
heart
from
beating
a
little
faster
as
he
watched
her
even
though
he
was
trying
to
regard
her
in
a
most
professional
sort
of
way
he
reminded
himself
that
she
was
an
iniquitous
little
jezebel
who
had
almost
murdered
him
carmin
fanchet
had
been
like
her
an
ame
damnee
a
fallen
angel
but
his
business
was
not
sympathy
in
such
matters
as
these
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
resist
the
lure
of
both
her
audacity
and
her
courage
and
he
found
himself
all
at
once
asking
himself
the
amazing
question
as
to
what
her
relationship
might
be
to
bateese
it
occurred
to
him
rather
unpleasantly
that
there
had
been
something
distinctly
proprietary
in
the
way
the
had
picked
her
up
on
the
sand
and
that
bateese
had
shown
no
hesitation
a
little
later
in
threatening
to
knock
his
head
off
unless
he
stopped
talking
to
her
he
wondered
if
bateese
was
a
boulain
the
two
or
three
minutes
of
excitement
in
the
boiling
waters
of
the
holy
ghost
had
acted
like
medicine
on
carrigan
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
had
given
way
in
his
head
relieving
him
of
an
oppression
that
had
been
like
an
iron
hoop
drawn
tightly
about
his
skull
he
did
not
want
bateese
to
suspect
this
change
in
him
and
he
slouched
lower
against
the
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
girl
he
was
finding
it
increasingly
difficult
to
keep
from
looking
at
her
she
had
resumed
her
paddling
and
bateese
was
putting
mighty
efforts
in
his
strokes
now
so
that
the
narrow
birchbark
canoe
shot
like
an
arrow
with
the
current
of
the
river
a
few
hundred
yards
below
was
a
twist
in
the
channel
and
as
the
canoe
rounded
this
taking
the
shoreward
curve
with
dizzying
swiftness
a
wide
still
lay
ahead
and
far
down
this
carrigan
saw
the
glow
of
fires
the
forest
had
drawn
back
from
the
river
leaving
in
its
place
a
broken
tundra
of
rock
and
shale
and
a
wide
strip
of
black
sand
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
itself
carrigan
knew
what
it
was
an
upheaval
of
the
country
so
common
still
farther
north
the
beginning
of
that
treasure
of
the
earth
which
would
some
day
make
the
top
of
the
american
continent
one
of
the
eldorados
of
the
world
the
fires
drew
nearer
and
suddenly
the
still
night
was
broken
by
the
wild
chanting
of
men
david
heard
behind
him
a
choking
note
in
the
throat
of
bateese
a
soft
word
came
from
the
lips
of
the
girl
and
it
seemed
to
carrigan
that
her
head
was
held
higher
in
the
moon
glow
the
chant
increased
in
volume
a
rhythmic
throbbing
savage
music
that
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
come
from
the
throats
of
men
along
the
three
rivers
it
thrilled
carrigan
as
they
bore
down
upon
it
it
was
not
song
as
civilization
would
have
counted
song
it
was
like
an
explosion
an
exultation
of
human
voice
unchained
ebullient
with
the
love
of
life
savage
in
its
it
was
le
gaite
de
coeur
of
the
rivermen
who
thought
and
sang
as
their
forefathers
did
in
the
days
of
radisson
and
good
prince
rupert
it
was
their
merriment
their
exhilaration
their
freedom
and
optimism
reaching
up
to
the
farthest
stars
in
that
song
men
were
straining
their
vocal
muscles
shouting
to
beat
out
their
nearest
neighbor
bellowing
like
bulls
in
a
frenzy
of
sudden
fun
and
then
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
in
the
night
the
clamor
of
voices
died
away
a
single
shout
came
up
the
river
carrigan
thought
he
heard
a
low
rumble
of
laughter
a
tin
pan
banged
against
another
a
dog
howled
the
flat
of
an
oar
played
a
tattoo
for
a
moment
on
the
bottom
of
a
boat
then
one
last
yell
from
a
single
throat
and
the
night
was
silent
again
and
that
was
the
boulain
brigade
singing
at
this
hour
of
the
night
when
men
should
have
been
sleeping
if
they
expected
to
be
up
with
the
sun
carrigan
stared
ahead
shortly
his
adventure
would
take
a
new
twist
something
was
bound
to
happen
when
they
got
ashore
the
peculiar
glow
of
the
fires
had
puzzled
him
now
he
began
to
understand
jeanne
boulain
men
were
camped
in
the
edge
of
the
and
had
lighted
a
number
of
natural
that
came
up
out
of
the
earth
many
times
he
had
seen
fires
like
these
burning
up
and
down
the
three
rivers
he
had
lighted
fires
of
his
own
he
had
cooked
over
them
and
had
afterward
had
the
fun
and
excitement
of
extinguishing
them
with
pails
of
water
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
quite
like
this
that
was
unfolding
itself
before
his
eyes
now
there
were
seven
of
the
fires
over
an
area
of
half
an
acre
spouts
of
yellowish
flame
burning
like
giant
torches
ten
or
fifteen
feet
in
the
air
and
between
them
he
very
soon
made
out
great
bustle
and
activity
many
figures
were
moving
about
they
looked
like
dwarfs
at
first
gnomes
at
play
in
a
little
world
made
out
of
witchcraft
but
bateese
was
sending
the
canoe
nearer
with
powerful
strokes
and
the
figures
grew
taller
and
the
spouts
of
flame
higher
then
he
knew
what
was
happening
the
boulain
men
were
taking
advantage
of
the
cool
hours
of
the
night
and
were
tarring
up
he
could
smell
the
tar
and
he
could
see
the
big
york
boats
drawn
up
in
the
circle
of
yellowish
light
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
them
and
men
stripped
to
the
waist
were
smearing
the
bottoms
of
the
boats
with
boiling
tar
and
pitch
in
the
center
was
a
big
black
cauldron
steaming
over
a
and
between
this
cauldron
and
the
boats
men
were
running
back
and
forth
with
pails
still
nearer
to
the
huge
kettle
other
men
were
filling
a
row
of
kegs
with
the
precious
black
goudron
that
oozed
up
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
forming
here
and
there
pools
that
carrigan
could
see
glistening
in
the
flare
of
the
he
figured
there
were
thirty
men
at
work
six
big
york
boats
were
turned
keel
up
in
the
black
sand
close
inshore
just
outside
the
circle
of
light
was
a
single
scow
toward
this
scow
bateese
sent
the
canoe
and
as
they
drew
nearer
until
the
laboring
men
ashore
were
scarcely
a
stone
throw
away
the
weirdness
of
the
scene
impressed
itself
more
upon
carrigan
never
had
he
seen
such
a
crew
there
were
no
indians
among
them
lithe
their
naked
arms
and
shoulders
gleaming
in
the
ghostly
illumination
they
were
racing
against
time
with
the
boiling
tar
and
pitch
in
the
cauldron
they
did
not
see
the
approach
of
the
canoe
and
bateese
did
not
draw
their
attention
to
it
quietly
he
drove
the
birchbark
under
the
shadow
of
the
big
bateau
hands
were
waiting
to
seize
and
steady
it
carrigan
caught
but
a
glimpse
of
the
faces
in
another
instant
the
girl
was
aboard
the
scow
and
bateese
was
bending
over
him
a
second
time
he
was
picked
up
like
a
child
in
the
arms
of
the
the
moonlight
showed
him
a
scow
bigger
than
he
had
ever
seen
on
the
upper
river
and
of
it
seemed
to
be
cabin
into
this
cabin
bateese
carried
him
and
in
darkness
laid
him
upon
what
carrigan
thought
must
be
a
cot
built
against
the
wall
he
made
no
sound
but
let
himself
fall
limply
upon
it
he
listened
to
bateese
as
he
moved
about
and
closed
his
eyes
when
bateese
struck
a
match
a
moment
later
he
heard
the
door
of
the
cabin
close
behind
the
not
until
then
did
he
open
his
eyes
and
sit
up
he
was
alone
and
what
he
saw
in
the
next
few
moments
drew
an
exclamation
of
amazement
from
him
never
had
he
seen
a
cabin
like
this
on
the
three
rivers
it
was
thirty
feet
long
if
an
inch
and
at
least
eight
feet
wide
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
of
polished
cedar
the
floor
was
of
cedar
closely
matched
it
was
the
exquisite
finish
and
craftsmanship
of
the
woodwork
that
caught
his
eyes
first
then
his
astonished
senses
seized
upon
the
other
things
under
his
feet
was
a
soft
rug
of
dark
green
velvet
two
magnificent
white
bearskins
lay
between
him
and
the
end
of
the
room
the
walls
were
hung
with
pictures
and
at
the
four
windows
were
curtains
of
ivory
lace
draped
with
damask
the
lamp
which
bateese
had
lighted
was
fastened
to
the
wall
close
to
him
it
was
of
polished
silver
and
threw
a
brilliant
light
softened
by
a
shade
of
old
gold
there
were
three
other
lamps
like
this
unlighted
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
in
deep
shadow
but
carrigan
made
out
the
thing
he
was
staring
at
a
piano
he
rose
to
his
feet
disbelieving
his
eyes
and
made
his
way
toward
it
he
passed
between
chairs
near
the
piano
was
another
door
and
a
wide
divan
of
the
same
soft
green
upholstery
looking
back
he
saw
that
what
he
had
been
lying
upon
was
another
divan
and
dose
to
this
were
and
a
table
on
which
were
magazines
and
papers
and
a
woman
workbasket
and
in
the
workbasket
sound
asleep
a
cat
and
then
over
the
table
and
the
sleeping
cat
his
eyes
rested
upon
a
triangular
banner
fastened
to
the
wall
in
white
against
a
background
of
black
was
a
mighty
polar
bear
holding
at
bay
a
horde
of
arctic
wolves
and
suddenly
the
thing
he
had
been
fighting
to
recall
came
to
carrigan
the
great
bear
the
fighting
wolves
the
crest
of
pierre
boulain
he
took
a
quick
step
toward
the
table
then
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
confound
his
head
or
was
it
the
big
bateau
rocking
under
his
feet
the
cat
seemed
to
be
turning
round
in
its
basket
there
were
half
a
dozen
banners
instead
of
one
the
lamp
was
shaking
in
its
bracket
the
floor
was
tilting
everything
was
becoming
hideously
contorted
and
out
of
place
a
shroud
of
darkness
gathered
about
him
and
through
that
darkness
carrigan
staggered
blindly
toward
the
divan
he
reached
it
just
in
time
to
fall
upon
it
like
a
dead
man
vi
for
what
seemed
to
be
an
interminable
time
after
the
final
breakdown
of
his
physical
strength
david
carrigan
lived
in
a
black
world
where
a
horde
of
unseen
little
devils
were
shooting
arrows
into
his
brain
he
did
not
sense
the
fact
of
human
presence
nor
that
the
divan
had
been
changed
into
a
bed
and
the
four
lamps
lighted
and
that
wrinkled
brown
hands
with
fingers
were
performing
a
miracle
of
wilderness
surgery
upon
him
he
did
not
see
the
face
of
nepapinas
the
wandering
bolt
of
lightning
as
the
bent
and
tottering
cree
called
upon
all
his
eighty
years
of
experience
to
bring
him
back
to
life
and
he
did
not
see
bateese
silent
nor
the
face
and
staring
eyes
of
jeanne
boulain
as
her
slim
white
fingers
worked
with
the
old
medicine
man
he
was
in
a
gulf
of
blackness
that
writhed
with
the
spirits
of
torment
he
fought
them
and
cried
out
against
them
and
his
fighting
and
his
cries
brought
the
look
of
death
itself
into
the
eyes
of
the
girl
who
was
over
him
he
did
not
hear
her
voice
nor
feel
the
soothing
of
her
hands
nor
the
powerful
grip
of
bateese
as
he
held
him
when
the
critical
moments
came
and
nepapinas
like
a
machine
that
had
looked
upon
death
a
thousand
times
gave
no
rest
to
his
fingers
until
the
work
was
done
and
it
was
then
that
something
came
to
drive
the
devils
out
of
the
darkness
that
was
smothering
carrigan
after
that
carrigan
lived
through
an
eternity
of
unrest
a
life
in
which
he
seemed
powerless
and
yet
was
always
struggling
for
supremacy
over
things
that
were
holding
him
down
there
were
lapses
in
it
like
the
hours
of
oblivion
that
come
with
sleep
and
there
were
other
times
when
he
seemed
keenly
alive
yet
unable
to
move
or
act
the
darkness
gave
way
to
flashes
of
light
and
in
these
flashes
he
began
to
see
things
curiously
twisted
fleeting
and
yet
fighting
themselves
insistently
upon
his
senses
he
was
back
in
the
hot
sand
again
and
this
time
he
heard
the
voices
of
jeanne
and
and
flaunted
a
banner
in
his
face
a
triangular
pennon
of
black
on
which
a
huge
bear
was
fighting
white
arctic
wolves
and
then
she
would
run
away
from
him
crying
out
pierre
boulain
pierre
boulain
and
the
last
he
could
see
of
her
was
her
hair
flaming
like
fire
in
the
sun
but
it
was
always
the
other
the
dark
hair
and
dark
eyes
that
came
to
him
when
the
little
devils
returned
to
assault
him
with
their
arrows
from
somewhere
she
would
come
out
of
darkness
and
frighten
them
away
he
could
hear
her
voice
like
a
whisper
in
his
ears
and
the
touch
of
her
hands
comforted
him
and
quieted
his
pain
after
a
time
he
grew
to
be
afraid
when
the
darkness
swallowed
her
up
and
in
that
darkness
he
would
call
for
her
and
always
he
heard
her
voice
in
answer
then
came
a
long
oblivion
he
floated
through
cool
space
away
from
the
imps
of
torment
his
bed
was
of
downy
clouds
and
on
these
clouds
he
drifted
with
a
great
shining
river
under
him
and
at
last
the
cloud
he
was
in
began
to
shape
itself
into
walls
and
on
these
walls
were
pictures
and
a
window
through
which
the
sun
was
shining
and
a
black
pennon
and
he
heard
a
soft
wonderful
music
that
seemed
to
come
to
him
faintly
from
another
world
other
creatures
were
at
work
in
his
brain
now
they
were
building
up
and
putting
together
the
loose
ends
of
things
carrigan
became
one
of
them
working
so
hard
that
frequently
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
came
out
of
the
dawning
of
things
to
stop
him
and
quieting
hands
and
a
voice
soothed
him
to
rest
the
hands
and
the
voice
became
very
intimate
he
missed
them
when
they
were
not
near
especially
the
hands
and
he
was
always
groping
for
them
to
make
sure
they
had
not
gone
away
only
once
after
the
floating
cloud
transformed
itself
into
the
walls
of
the
bateau
cabin
did
the
chaotic
darkness
of
the
sands
fully
possess
him
again
in
that
darkness
he
heard
a
voice
it
was
not
the
voice
of
or
of
bateese
or
of
jeanne
it
was
close
to
his
ears
and
in
that
darkness
that
smothered
him
there
was
something
terrible
about
it
as
it
droned
slowly
the
words
he
tried
to
answer
to
call
back
to
it
and
the
voice
came
again
repeating
the
words
emotionless
hollow
as
if
echoing
up
out
of
a
grave
and
still
harder
he
struggled
to
reply
to
it
to
say
that
he
was
david
carrigan
and
that
he
was
out
on
the
trail
of
black
roger
audemard
and
that
black
roger
was
far
north
and
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
voice
changed
into
the
flesh
and
blood
of
black
roger
himself
though
he
could
not
see
in
the
darkness
and
he
reached
out
gripping
fiercely
at
the
warm
substance
of
flesh
until
he
heard
another
voice
the
voice
of
jeanne
boulain
entreating
him
to
let
his
victim
go
it
was
this
time
that
his
eyes
shot
open
wide
and
seeing
and
straight
over
him
was
the
face
of
jeanne
nearer
him
than
it
had
been
even
in
the
visionings
of
his
feverish
mind
his
fingers
were
clutching
her
shoulders
gripping
like
steel
hooks
david
she
was
crying
for
a
moment
he
stared
then
his
hands
and
fingers
relaxed
and
his
arms
dropped
limply
pardon
i
i
was
dreaming
he
struggled
weakly
i
thought
he
had
seen
the
pain
in
her
face
now
changing
swiftly
it
lighted
up
with
relief
and
gladness
his
vision
cleared
by
long
darkness
saw
the
change
come
in
an
instant
like
a
flash
of
sunshine
and
then
so
near
that
he
could
have
touched
her
she
was
smiling
down
into
his
eyes
he
smiled
back
it
took
an
effort
for
his
face
felt
stiff
and
unnatural
i
was
dreaming
of
a
man
named
roger
audemard
he
continued
to
apologize
did
i
hurt
you
the
smile
on
her
lips
was
gone
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
a
little
i
am
glad
you
are
better
you
have
been
very
sick
he
raised
a
hand
to
his
face
the
bandage
was
there
and
also
a
stubble
of
beard
on
his
cheeks
he
was
puzzled
this
morning
he
had
fastened
his
steel
mirror
to
the
side
of
a
tree
and
shaved
it
was
three
days
ago
you
were
hurt
she
said
quietly
this
is
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
you
have
been
in
a
great
fever
nepapinas
my
indian
doctor
saved
your
life
you
must
lie
quietly
now
you
have
been
talking
a
great
deal
about
black
roger
he
said
she
nodded
and
golden
hair
yes
of
golden
hair
and
some
one
else
with
dark
hair
and
dark
eyes
it
may
be
and
of
little
devils
with
bows
and
arrows
and
of
polar
bears
and
white
wolves
and
of
a
great
lord
of
the
north
who
calls
himself
pierre
boulain
yes
of
all
those
then
i
have
anything
more
to
tell
you
grunted
david
i
guess
i
told
you
all
i
know
you
shot
me
back
there
and
here
i
am
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
call
bateese
she
answered
promptly
and
she
rose
swiftly
from
beside
him
and
moved
toward
the
door
he
made
no
effort
to
call
her
back
his
wits
were
working
slowly
readjusting
themselves
after
a
carnival
in
chaos
and
he
scarcely
sensed
that
she
was
gone
until
the
cabin
door
closed
behind
her
then
again
he
raised
a
hand
to
his
face
and
felt
his
beard
three
days
he
turned
his
head
so
that
he
could
take
in
the
length
of
the
cabin
it
was
filled
with
subdued
sunlight
now
a
western
sun
that
glowed
softly
giving
depth
and
richness
to
the
colors
on
the
floor
and
walls
lighting
up
the
piano
keys
suffusing
the
pictures
with
a
warmth
of
life
david
eyes
traveled
slowly
to
his
own
feet
the
divan
had
been
opened
and
transformed
into
a
bed
he
was
undressed
he
had
on
somebody
white
nightgown
and
there
was
a
big
bunch
of
wild
roses
on
the
table
where
three
days
ago
the
cat
had
been
sleeping
in
the
his
head
cleared
swiftly
and
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
one
elbow
with
extreme
caution
and
listened
the
big
bateau
was
not
moving
it
was
still
tied
up
but
he
could
hear
no
voices
out
where
the
were
he
dropped
back
on
his
pillow
and
his
eyes
rested
on
the
black
pennon
his
blood
stirred
again
as
he
looked
at
the
white
bear
and
the
fighting
wolves
wherever
men
rode
the
waters
of
the
three
rivers
that
pennon
was
known
yet
it
was
not
common
seldom
was
it
seen
and
never
had
it
come
south
of
chipewyan
many
things
came
to
carrigan
now
things
that
he
had
heard
at
the
landing
and
up
and
down
the
rivers
once
he
had
read
the
of
a
report
the
superintendent
of
n
division
had
sent
in
to
headquarters
we
do
not
know
this
pierre
few
men
have
seen
him
out
of
his
own
country
the
far
headwaters
of
the
yellowknife
where
he
rules
like
a
great
overlord
both
the
yellowknives
and
the
dog
ribs
call
him
kicheoo
kimow
or
king
and
the
same
rumors
say
there
is
never
starvation
or
plague
in
his
regions
and
it
is
fact
that
neither
the
hudson
bay
nor
revillon
brothers
in
their
cleverest
generalship
and
trade
have
been
able
to
uproot
his
almost
dynastic
jurisdiction
the
police
have
had
no
reason
to
investigate
or
interfere
at
least
that
was
the
gist
of
what
carrigan
had
read
in
report
but
he
had
never
associated
it
with
the
name
of
boulain
it
was
of
pierre
that
he
had
heard
stories
pierre
and
his
black
pennon
with
its
white
bear
and
fighting
wolves
and
so
it
was
pierre
boulain
he
closed
his
eyes
and
thought
of
the
long
winter
weeks
he
had
passed
at
hay
river
post
watching
for
fanchet
the
mail
robber
it
was
there
he
had
heard
most
about
this
pierre
and
yet
no
one
he
had
talked
with
had
ever
seen
him
no
one
knew
whether
he
was
old
or
young
a
pigmy
or
a
giant
some
stories
said
that
he
was
strong
that
he
could
twist
a
double
in
his
hands
others
said
that
he
was
old
very
old
so
that
he
never
set
forth
with
his
brigades
that
brought
down
each
year
a
treasure
of
furs
to
be
exchanged
for
freight
and
never
did
a
dog
rib
or
a
yellowknife
open
his
mouth
about
kicheoo
kimow
pierre
the
master
of
their
unmapped
domains
in
that
great
country
north
and
west
of
the
great
slave
he
remained
an
enigma
and
a
sphinx
if
he
ever
came
out
with
his
brigades
he
did
not
disclose
his
identity
so
that
if
one
saw
a
fleet
of
boats
or
canoes
with
the
pierre
pennon
one
had
to
make
his
own
guess
whether
pierre
himself
was
there
or
not
but
these
things
were
known
that
the
keenest
quickest
and
strongest
men
in
the
northland
ran
the
pierre
brigades
that
they
brought
out
the
richest
cargoes
of
furs
and
that
they
carried
back
with
them
into
the
secret
fastnesses
of
their
wilderness
the
greatest
cargoes
of
freight
that
treasure
could
buy
so
much
the
name
pierre
dragged
out
of
carrigan
memory
it
came
to
him
now
why
the
name
boulain
had
pounded
so
insistently
in
his
brain
he
had
seen
this
pennon
with
its
white
bear
and
fighting
wolves
only
once
before
and
that
had
been
over
a
boulain
scow
at
chipewyan
but
his
memory
had
lost
its
grip
on
that
incident
while
retaining
vividly
its
hold
on
the
stories
and
rumors
of
the
pierre
carrigan
pulled
himself
a
little
higher
on
his
pillow
and
with
a
new
interest
scanned
the
cabin
he
had
never
heard
of
boulain
women
yet
here
was
the
proof
of
their
existence
and
of
the
greatness
that
ran
in
the
red
blood
of
their
veins
the
history
of
the
great
northland
hidden
in
the
tomes
and
guarded
documents
of
the
great
company
had
always
been
of
absorbing
interest
to
him
he
wondered
why
it
was
that
the
outside
world
knew
so
little
about
it
and
believed
so
little
of
what
it
heard
a
long
time
ago
he
had
penned
an
article
telling
briefly
the
story
of
this
half
of
a
great
continent
in
which
for
two
hundred
years
romance
and
tragedy
and
strife
for
mastery
had
gone
on
in
a
way
to
thrill
the
hearts
of
men
he
had
told
of
huge
forts
with
stone
bastions
of
fierce
wars
of
great
warships
that
had
fired
their
broadsides
in
battle
in
the
waters
of
hudson
bay
he
had
described
the
coming
into
this
northern
world
of
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
the
bravest
and
men
of
england
and
france
and
how
these
thousands
had
continued
to
come
bringing
with
them
the
names
of
kings
of
princes
and
of
great
lords
until
out
of
the
savagery
of
the
north
rose
an
aristocracy
of
race
built
up
of
the
strongest
men
of
the
earth
and
these
men
of
later
days
he
had
called
lords
of
the
north
men
who
had
held
power
of
life
and
death
in
the
hollow
of
their
hands
until
the
great
company
yielded
up
its
suzerainty
to
the
government
of
the
dominion
in
men
who
were
kings
in
their
domains
whose
word
was
law
who
were
more
powerful
in
their
wilderness
castles
than
their
mistress
over
the
sea
the
queen
of
britain
and
carrigan
after
writing
of
these
things
had
stuffed
his
manuscript
away
in
the
bottom
of
his
chest
at
barracks
for
he
believed
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
do
justice
to
the
people
of
this
wilderness
world
that
he
loved
the
powerful
old
lords
were
gone
like
dethroned
monarchs
stripped
to
the
level
of
other
men
they
lived
in
the
memories
of
what
had
been
their
might
now
lay
in
trade
no
more
could
they
set
out
to
wage
war
upon
their
rivals
with
powder
and
ball
keen
wit
swift
dogs
and
the
politics
of
barter
had
taken
the
place
of
deadlier
things
le
facteur
could
no
longer
slay
or
command
that
others
be
slain
a
mightier
hand
than
his
now
ruled
the
destinies
of
the
northern
people
the
hand
of
the
royal
northwest
mounted
police
it
was
this
thought
the
thought
that
law
and
one
of
the
powerful
forces
of
the
wilderness
had
met
in
this
cabin
of
the
big
bateau
that
came
to
carrigan
as
he
drew
himself
still
higher
against
his
pillow
a
greater
thrill
possessed
him
than
the
thrill
of
his
hunt
for
black
roger
audemard
black
roger
was
a
murderer
a
wholesale
murderer
and
a
fiend
a
moloch
for
whom
there
could
be
no
pity
of
all
men
the
law
wanted
black
roger
most
and
he
david
carrigan
was
the
chosen
one
to
consummate
its
desire
yet
in
spite
of
that
he
felt
upon
him
the
strange
unrest
of
a
greater
adventure
than
the
quest
for
black
roger
it
was
like
an
impending
thing
that
could
not
be
seen
urging
him
rousing
his
faculties
from
the
slough
into
which
they
had
fallen
because
of
his
wound
and
sickness
it
was
after
all
the
most
vital
of
all
things
a
matter
of
his
own
life
jeanne
boulain
had
tried
to
kill
him
deliberately
with
malice
and
intent
that
she
had
saved
him
afterward
only
added
to
the
necessity
of
an
explanation
and
he
was
determined
that
he
would
have
that
explanation
and
settle
the
present
matter
before
he
allowed
another
thought
of
black
roger
to
enter
his
head
this
resolution
reiterated
itself
in
his
mind
as
the
voice
of
duty
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
law
and
yet
the
consciousness
of
his
accountability
to
that
law
kept
repeating
itself
in
the
very
face
of
it
carrigan
knew
that
something
besides
the
moral
obligation
of
the
thing
was
urging
him
something
that
was
becoming
deeply
and
dangerously
personal
at
least
he
tried
to
think
of
it
as
dangerous
and
that
danger
was
his
unbecoming
interest
in
the
girl
herself
it
was
an
interest
distinctly
removed
from
any
ethical
code
that
might
have
governed
him
in
his
experience
with
carmin
fanchet
for
instance
comparatively
if
they
had
stood
together
carmin
would
have
been
the
lovelier
but
he
would
have
looked
longer
at
jeanne
boulain
he
conceded
the
point
smiling
a
bit
grimly
as
he
continued
to
study
that
part
of
the
cabin
which
he
could
see
from
his
pillow
he
had
lost
interest
temporarily
at
least
in
black
roger
audemard
not
long
ago
the
one
question
to
which
above
all
others
he
had
desired
an
answer
was
why
had
jeanne
boulain
worked
so
desperately
to
kill
him
and
so
hard
to
save
him
afterward
now
as
he
looked
about
him
the
question
which
repeated
itself
insistently
was
what
relationship
did
she
bear
to
this
mysterious
lord
of
the
north
pierre
undoubtedly
she
was
his
daughter
for
whom
pierre
had
built
this
luxurious
barge
of
state
a
offspring
he
thought
one
like
cleopatra
herself
not
afraid
to
kill
and
equally
quick
to
make
amends
when
there
was
a
mistake
there
came
the
quiet
opening
of
the
cabin
door
to
break
in
upon
his
thought
he
hoped
it
was
jeanne
returning
to
him
it
was
nepapinas
the
old
indian
stood
over
him
for
a
moment
and
put
a
cold
hand
to
his
forehead
he
grunted
and
nodded
his
head
his
little
sunken
eyes
gleaming
with
satisfaction
then
he
put
his
hands
under
david
arms
and
lifted
him
until
he
was
sitting
upright
with
three
or
four
pillows
at
his
back
thanks
said
carrigan
that
makes
me
feel
better
and
if
you
mind
my
last
lunch
was
three
days
ago
boiled
prunes
and
a
piece
of
bannock
i
have
brought
you
something
to
eat
david
broke
in
a
soft
voice
behind
him
nepapinas
slipped
away
and
jeanne
stood
in
his
place
david
stared
up
at
her
speechless
he
heard
the
door
close
behind
the
old
indian
then
jeanne
drew
up
a
chair
so
that
for
the
first
time
he
could
see
her
clear
eyes
with
the
light
of
day
full
upon
her
he
forgot
that
a
few
days
ago
she
had
been
his
deadliest
enemy
he
forgot
the
existence
of
a
man
named
black
roger
audemard
her
slimness
was
as
it
had
pictured
itself
to
him
in
the
hot
sands
her
hair
was
as
he
had
seen
it
there
it
was
coiled
upon
her
head
like
ropes
of
spun
silk
glowing
softly
but
it
was
her
eyes
he
stared
at
and
so
fixed
was
his
look
that
the
red
lips
trembled
a
bit
on
the
verge
of
a
smile
she
was
not
embarrassed
there
was
no
color
in
the
clear
whiteness
of
her
skin
except
that
redness
of
her
lips
i
thought
you
had
black
eyes
he
said
bluntly
i
glad
you
have
i
do
like
them
yours
are
as
brown
as
as
please
she
interrupted
him
sitting
down
close
beside
him
will
you
eat
now
a
spoon
was
at
his
mouth
and
he
was
forced
to
take
it
in
or
have
its
contents
spilled
over
him
the
spoon
continued
to
move
quickly
between
the
bowl
and
his
mouth
he
was
robbed
of
speech
and
the
girl
eyes
as
surely
as
he
was
alive
were
beginning
to
laugh
at
him
they
were
a
wonderful
brown
with
little
golden
specks
in
them
like
the
freckles
he
had
seen
in
her
lips
parted
between
their
bewitching
redness
he
saw
the
gleam
of
her
white
teeth
in
a
crowd
with
her
glorious
hair
covered
and
her
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
one
would
not
have
picked
her
out
but
close
like
this
with
her
eyes
smiling
at
him
she
was
adorable
something
of
carrigan
thoughts
must
have
shown
in
his
face
for
suddenly
the
girl
lips
tightened
a
little
and
the
warmth
went
out
of
her
eyes
leaving
them
cold
and
distant
he
finished
the
soup
and
she
rose
again
to
her
feet
please
do
go
he
said
if
you
do
i
think
i
shall
get
up
and
follow
i
am
quite
sure
i
am
entitled
to
a
little
something
more
than
soup
nepapinas
says
that
you
may
have
a
bit
of
boiled
fish
for
supper
she
assured
him
you
know
i
do
mean
that
i
want
to
know
why
you
shot
me
and
what
you
think
you
are
going
to
do
with
me
i
shot
you
by
mistake
and
i
do
know
just
what
to
do
with
you
she
said
looking
at
him
tranquilly
but
with
what
he
thought
was
a
growing
shadow
of
perplexity
in
her
eyes
bateese
says
to
fasten
a
big
stone
to
your
neck
and
throw
you
in
the
river
but
bateese
always
mean
what
he
says
i
do
think
he
is
quite
as
bloodthirsty
as
the
young
lady
who
tried
to
murder
me
behind
the
rock
carrigan
interjected
exactly
i
do
think
he
would
throw
you
into
the
river
unless
i
told
him
to
and
i
do
believe
i
am
going
to
ask
him
to
do
that
she
added
the
soft
glow
flashing
back
into
her
eyes
for
an
instant
not
after
the
splendid
work
nepapinas
has
done
on
your
head
pierre
must
see
that
and
then
if
pierre
wishes
to
finish
you
why
she
shrugged
her
slim
shoulders
and
made
a
little
gesture
with
her
hands
in
that
same
moment
there
came
over
her
a
change
as
sudden
as
the
passing
of
light
itself
it
was
as
if
a
thing
she
was
hiding
had
broken
beyond
her
control
for
an
instant
and
had
betrayed
her
the
gesture
died
the
glow
went
out
of
her
eyes
and
in
its
place
came
a
light
that
was
almost
fear
or
pain
she
came
nearer
to
carrigan
again
and
somehow
looking
up
at
her
he
thought
of
the
little
brush
warbler
singing
at
the
end
of
its
birch
twig
to
give
him
courage
it
must
have
been
because
of
her
throat
white
and
soft
which
he
saw
pulsing
like
a
beating
heart
before
she
spoke
to
him
i
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
david
she
said
her
voice
barely
rising
above
a
whisper
i
sorry
i
hurt
you
i
thought
it
was
some
one
else
behind
the
rock
but
i
can
not
tell
you
more
than
that
ever
and
i
know
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
be
friends
she
paused
one
of
her
hands
creeping
to
her
bare
throat
as
if
to
cover
the
throbbing
he
had
seen
there
why
is
it
impossible
he
demanded
leaning
away
from
his
pillows
so
that
he
might
bring
himself
nearer
to
her
because
you
are
of
the
police
the
police
yes
he
said
his
heart
thrumming
inside
his
breast
i
am
sergeant
carrigan
i
am
out
after
roger
audemard
a
murderer
but
my
commission
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
daughter
of
pierre
boulain
please
let
be
friends
he
held
out
his
hand
and
in
that
moment
david
carrigan
placed
another
thing
higher
than
duty
and
in
his
eyes
was
the
confession
of
it
like
the
glow
of
a
subdued
fire
the
girl
fingers
drew
more
closely
at
her
throat
and
she
made
no
movement
to
accept
his
hand
friends
he
repeated
friends
in
spite
of
the
police
slowly
the
girl
eyes
had
widened
as
if
she
saw
that
thing
riding
over
all
other
things
in
his
swiftly
beating
heart
and
afraid
of
it
she
drew
a
step
away
from
him
i
am
not
pierre
boulain
daughter
she
said
forcing
the
words
out
one
by
one
i
am
his
wife
vii
afterward
carrigan
wondered
to
what
depths
he
had
fallen
in
the
first
moments
of
his
disillusionment
something
like
shock
perhaps
even
more
than
that
must
have
betrayed
itself
in
his
face
he
did
not
speak
slowly
his
outstretched
arm
dropped
to
the
white
counterpane
later
he
called
himself
a
fool
for
allowing
it
to
happen
for
it
was
as
if
he
had
measured
his
proffered
friendship
by
what
its
future
might
hold
for
him
in
a
low
quiet
voice
jeanne
boulain
was
saying
again
that
she
was
pierre
wife
she
was
not
excited
yet
he
understood
now
why
it
was
he
had
thought
her
eyes
were
very
dark
they
had
changed
swiftly
the
violet
freckles
in
them
were
like
little
flecks
of
gold
they
were
almost
liquid
in
their
glow
neither
brown
nor
black
now
and
with
that
threat
of
gathering
lightning
in
them
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
slightest
flush
of
color
in
her
cheeks
it
deepened
even
as
he
held
out
his
hand
again
he
knew
that
it
was
not
embarrassment
it
was
the
heat
of
the
fire
back
of
her
eyes
it
funny
he
said
making
an
effort
to
redeem
himself
with
a
lie
and
smiling
you
rather
amaze
me
you
see
i
have
been
told
this
pierre
is
an
old
old
man
so
old
that
he
ca
stand
on
his
feet
or
go
with
his
brigades
and
if
that
is
the
truth
it
is
hard
for
me
to
picture
you
as
his
wife
but
that
is
a
reason
why
we
should
not
be
friends
is
it
he
felt
that
he
was
himself
again
except
for
the
three
days
growth
of
beard
on
his
face
he
tried
to
laugh
but
it
was
rather
a
poor
attempt
and
pierre
wife
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
she
was
looking
at
him
looking
into
and
through
him
with
those
glowing
eyes
then
she
sat
down
out
of
reach
of
the
hand
which
he
had
held
toward
her
you
are
a
sergeant
of
the
police
she
said
the
softness
gone
suddenly
out
of
her
voice
you
are
an
honorable
man
your
hand
is
against
all
wrong
is
it
not
so
it
was
the
voice
of
an
inquisitor
she
was
demanding
an
answer
of
him
he
nodded
yes
it
is
so
the
fire
in
her
eyes
deepened
and
yet
you
say
you
want
to
be
the
friend
of
a
stranger
who
has
tried
to
kill
you
why
he
was
cornered
he
sensed
the
humiliation
of
it
the
impossibility
of
confessing
to
her
the
wild
impulse
that
had
moved
him
before
he
knew
she
was
pierre
wife
and
she
did
not
wait
for
him
to
answer
this
this
roger
audemard
if
you
catch
him
what
will
you
do
with
him
she
asked
he
will
be
hanged
said
david
he
is
a
murderer
and
one
who
tries
to
kill
who
almost
succeeds
what
is
the
penalty
for
that
she
leaned
toward
him
waiting
her
hands
were
clasped
tightly
in
her
lap
the
spots
were
brighter
in
her
cheeks
from
ten
to
twenty
years
he
acknowledged
but
of
course
there
may
be
circumstances
if
so
you
do
not
know
them
she
interrupted
him
you
say
roger
audemard
is
a
murderer
you
know
i
tried
to
kill
you
then
why
is
it
you
would
be
my
friend
and
roger
audemard
enemy
why
carrigan
shrugged
his
shoulders
hopelessly
i
should
he
confessed
i
guess
you
are
proving
i
was
wrong
in
what
i
said
i
ought
to
arrest
you
and
take
you
back
to
the
landing
as
soon
as
i
can
but
you
see
it
strikes
me
there
is
a
big
personal
element
in
this
i
was
the
man
almost
killed
there
was
a
mistake
must
have
been
for
as
soon
as
you
put
me
out
of
business
you
began
nursing
me
back
to
life
again
and
but
that
does
change
it
insisted
pierre
wife
if
there
had
been
no
mistake
there
would
have
been
a
murder
do
you
understand
if
it
had
been
some
one
else
behind
that
rock
i
am
quite
certain
he
would
have
died
the
law
at
least
would
have
called
it
murder
if
roger
audemard
is
a
criminal
then
i
also
am
a
criminal
and
an
honorable
man
would
not
make
a
distinction
because
one
of
them
is
a
woman
but
black
roger
was
a
fiend
he
deserves
no
mercy
he
perhaps
she
was
on
her
feet
her
eyes
flaming
down
upon
him
in
that
moment
her
beauty
was
like
the
beauty
of
carmin
fanchet
the
poise
of
her
slender
body
her
glowing
cheeks
her
lustrous
hair
her
eyes
with
the
light
of
diamonds
in
them
held
him
speechless
i
was
sorry
and
went
back
for
you
she
said
i
wanted
you
to
live
after
i
saw
you
like
that
on
the
sand
bateese
says
i
was
indiscreet
that
i
should
have
left
you
there
to
die
perhaps
he
is
right
and
yet
even
roger
audemard
might
have
had
that
pity
for
you
she
turned
quickly
and
he
heard
her
moving
away
from
him
then
from
the
door
she
said
bateese
will
make
you
comfortable
the
door
opened
and
closed
she
was
gone
and
he
was
alone
in
the
cabin
again
the
swiftness
of
the
change
in
her
amazed
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
suddenly
touched
fire
to
an
explosive
there
had
been
the
flare
but
no
violence
she
had
not
raised
her
voice
yet
he
heard
in
it
the
tremble
of
an
emotion
that
was
consuming
her
he
had
seen
the
flame
of
it
in
her
face
and
eyes
something
he
had
said
or
had
done
had
tremendously
upset
her
changing
in
an
instant
her
attitude
toward
him
the
thought
that
came
to
him
made
his
face
burn
under
its
scrub
of
beard
did
she
think
he
was
a
scoundrel
the
dropping
of
his
hand
the
shock
that
must
have
betrayed
itself
in
his
face
when
she
said
she
was
wife
had
those
things
warned
her
against
him
the
heat
went
slowly
out
of
his
face
it
was
impossible
she
could
not
think
that
of
him
it
must
have
been
a
sudden
giving
way
under
terrific
strain
she
had
compared
herself
to
roger
audemard
and
she
was
beginning
to
realize
her
peril
that
bateese
was
right
that
she
should
have
left
him
to
die
in
the
sand
the
thought
pressed
itself
heavily
upon
carrigan
it
brought
him
suddenly
back
to
a
realization
of
how
small
a
part
he
had
played
in
this
last
half
hour
in
the
cabin
he
had
offered
to
pierre
wife
a
friendship
which
he
had
no
right
to
offer
and
which
she
knew
he
had
no
right
to
offer
he
was
the
law
and
she
like
roger
audemard
was
a
criminal
her
quick
woman
instinct
had
told
her
there
could
be
no
distinction
between
them
unless
there
was
a
reason
and
now
carrigan
confessed
to
himself
that
there
had
been
a
reason
that
reason
had
come
to
him
with
the
first
glimpse
of
her
as
he
lay
in
the
hot
sand
he
had
fought
against
it
in
the
canoe
it
had
mastered
him
in
those
thrilling
moments
when
he
had
beheld
this
slim
beautiful
creature
riding
fearlessly
into
the
boiling
waters
of
the
holy
ghost
her
eyes
her
hair
the
sweet
low
voice
that
had
been
with
him
in
his
fever
had
become
a
definite
and
unalterable
part
of
him
and
this
must
have
shown
in
his
eyes
and
face
when
he
dropped
his
hand
when
she
told
him
she
was
pierre
wife
and
now
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
was
regretting
that
she
had
not
left
him
to
die
she
had
misunderstood
what
she
had
seen
betraying
itself
during
those
few
seconds
of
his
proffered
friendship
she
saw
only
a
man
whom
she
had
nearly
killed
a
man
who
represented
the
law
a
man
whose
power
held
her
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
she
had
stepped
back
from
him
startled
and
had
told
him
that
she
was
not
daughter
but
his
wife
in
the
science
of
criminal
analysis
carrigan
always
placed
himself
in
the
position
of
the
other
man
and
he
was
beginning
to
see
the
present
situation
from
the
of
jeanne
boulain
he
was
satisfied
that
she
had
made
a
desperate
mistake
and
that
until
the
last
moment
she
had
believed
it
was
another
man
behind
the
rock
yet
she
had
shown
no
inclination
to
explain
away
her
error
she
had
definitely
refused
to
make
an
explanation
and
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
common
sense
to
concede
that
there
must
be
a
powerful
motive
for
her
refusal
there
was
but
one
conclusion
for
him
to
arrive
at
the
error
which
pierre
wife
had
made
in
shooting
the
wrong
man
was
less
important
to
her
than
keeping
the
secret
of
why
she
had
wanted
to
kill
some
other
man
david
was
not
unconscious
of
the
breach
in
his
own
armor
he
had
weakened
just
as
the
superintendent
of
n
division
had
weakened
that
day
four
years
ago
when
they
had
almost
quarreled
over
carmin
fanchet
i
swear
to
heaven
she
is
bad
no
matter
what
her
brother
has
been
mcvane
had
said
i
gamble
my
life
on
that
carrigan
and
because
the
chief
of
division
with
sixty
years
of
experience
behind
him
had
believed
that
carmin
fanchet
had
not
been
held
as
an
accomplice
in
her
brother
evildoing
but
had
gone
back
into
her
wilderness
uncrucified
by
the
law
that
had
demanded
the
life
of
her
brother
he
would
never
forget
the
last
time
he
had
seen
carmin
fanchet
eyes
great
black
glorious
pools
of
gratitude
as
they
looked
at
grizzled
old
mcvane
blazing
fires
of
venomous
hatred
when
they
turned
on
him
and
he
had
said
to
mcvane
the
man
pays
the
woman
goes
justice
indeed
is
blind
mcvane
not
being
a
stickler
on
regulations
when
it
came
to
carrigan
had
made
no
answer
the
incident
came
back
vividly
to
david
as
he
waited
for
the
promised
coming
of
bateese
he
began
to
appreciate
mcvane
point
of
view
and
it
was
comforting
because
he
realized
that
his
own
logic
was
assailable
if
mcvane
had
been
comparing
the
two
women
now
he
knew
what
his
argument
would
be
there
had
been
no
absolute
proof
of
crime
against
carmin
fanchet
unless
to
fight
desperately
for
the
life
of
her
brother
was
a
crime
in
the
case
of
jeanne
boulain
there
was
proof
she
had
tried
to
kill
therefore
of
the
two
carmin
fanchet
would
have
been
the
better
woman
in
the
eyes
of
mcvane
in
spite
of
the
legal
force
of
the
argument
which
he
was
bringing
against
himself
david
felt
unconvinced
carmin
fanchet
had
she
been
in
the
place
of
pierre
wife
would
have
finished
him
there
in
the
sand
she
would
have
realized
the
menace
of
letting
him
live
and
would
probably
have
commanded
bateese
to
dump
him
in
the
river
wife
had
gone
to
the
other
extreme
she
was
not
only
repentant
but
was
making
restitution
for
her
mistake
and
in
making
that
restitution
had
crossed
far
beyond
the
of
caution
she
had
frankly
told
him
who
she
was
she
had
brought
him
into
the
privacy
of
what
was
undeniably
her
own
home
in
her
desire
to
undo
what
she
had
done
she
had
hopelessly
enmeshed
herself
in
the
net
of
the
law
if
that
law
saw
fit
to
act
she
had
done
these
things
with
courage
and
conviction
and
of
such
a
woman
carrigan
thought
pierre
must
be
very
proud
he
looked
slowly
about
the
cabin
again
and
each
thing
that
he
saw
was
a
living
voice
breaking
up
a
dream
for
him
these
voices
told
him
that
he
was
in
a
temple
built
because
of
a
man
worship
for
a
woman
and
that
man
was
pierre
through
the
two
western
windows
came
the
last
glow
of
the
western
sun
like
a
golden
benediction
finding
its
way
into
a
sacred
place
here
there
was
or
had
been
a
great
happiness
for
only
a
great
pride
and
a
great
happiness
could
have
made
it
as
it
was
nothing
that
wealth
and
toil
could
drag
up
out
of
a
civilization
a
thousand
miles
away
had
been
too
good
for
pierre
wife
and
about
him
looking
more
closely
david
saw
the
undisturbed
evidences
of
a
woman
contentment
on
the
table
were
embroidery
materials
with
which
she
had
been
working
and
a
half
finished
a
magazine
printed
in
a
city
four
thousand
miles
away
lay
open
at
the
fashion
plates
there
were
other
magazines
and
many
books
and
open
music
above
the
white
keyboard
of
the
piano
and
vases
glowing
red
and
yellow
with
and
silver
birch
leaves
he
could
smell
the
faint
perfume
of
the
fireglow
blossoms
red
as
blood
in
a
pool
of
sunlight
on
one
of
the
big
white
bear
rugs
lay
the
sleeping
cat
and
then
at
the
far
end
of
the
cabin
an
cross
of
christ
glowed
for
a
few
moments
in
a
last
homage
of
the
sinking
sun
uneasiness
stole
upon
him
this
was
the
woman
holy
ground
her
sanctuary
and
her
home
and
for
three
days
his
presence
had
driven
her
from
it
there
was
no
other
room
in
making
restitution
she
had
given
up
to
him
her
most
sacred
of
all
things
and
again
there
rose
up
in
him
that
thing
which
had
set
strange
fires
stirring
in
his
heart
and
which
from
this
hour
on
he
knew
he
must
fight
until
it
was
dead
for
an
hour
after
the
last
of
the
sun
was
obliterated
by
the
western
mountains
he
lay
in
the
gloom
of
coming
darkness
only
the
lapping
of
water
under
the
bateau
broke
the
strange
stillness
of
the
evening
he
heard
no
sound
of
life
no
voice
no
tread
of
feet
and
he
wondered
where
the
woman
and
her
men
had
gone
and
if
the
scow
was
still
tied
up
at
the
edge
of
the
and
for
the
first
time
he
asked
himself
another
question
where
was
the
man
pierre
viii
it
was
utterly
dark
in
the
cabin
when
the
stillness
was
broken
by
low
voices
outside
the
door
opened
and
some
one
came
in
a
moment
later
a
match
flared
up
and
in
the
shifting
glow
of
it
carrigan
saw
the
dark
face
of
bateese
the
one
after
another
he
lighted
the
four
lamps
not
until
he
had
finished
did
he
turn
toward
the
bed
it
was
then
that
david
had
his
first
good
impression
of
the
man
he
was
not
tall
but
built
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
his
arms
were
long
his
shoulders
were
stooped
his
head
was
like
the
head
of
a
stone
gargoyle
come
to
life
with
the
high
of
an
indian
and
uncut
black
hair
bound
with
the
knotted
red
mouchoir
he
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
pirate
and
a
cutthroat
to
david
such
a
man
he
thought
might
make
play
out
of
the
business
of
murder
and
yet
in
spite
of
his
ugliness
david
felt
again
the
mysterious
inclination
to
like
the
man
bateese
grinned
it
was
a
huge
grin
for
his
mouth
was
big
you

he
announced

he
returned
to
the
door
and
brought
back
with
him
a
wicker
basket
then
he
drew
up
the
table
beside
carrigan
and
proceeded
to
lay
out
before
him
the
boiled
fish
which
pierre
wife
had
promised
him
with
it
was
bread
and
an
earthen
pot
of
hot
tea
she
say

he
stood
back
and
pointed
at
the
food

queek
when
you
have
finish
i
tell
you
now
that
he
saw
the
luscious
bit
of
whitefish
before
him
carrigan
was
possessed
of
the
hungering
emptiness
of
three
days
and
nights
as
he
ate
he
observed
that
bateese
was
performing
curious
duties
he
straightened
a
couple
of
rugs
ran
fresh
water
into
the
flower
vases
picked
up
half
a
dozen
scattered
magazines
and
then
to
increasing
interest
produced
a
from
somewhere
and
began
to
dust
david
finished
his
fish
the
one
slice
of
bread
and
his
cup
of
tea
he
felt
tremendously
good
the
hot
tea
was
like
a
trickle
of
new
life
through
every
vein
in
his
body
and
he
had
the
desire
to
get
up
and
try
out
his
legs
suddenly
bateese
discovered
that
his
patient
was
laughing
at
him
que
diable
he
demanded
coming
up
ferociously
with
the
cloth
in
his
great
hand
you

fonny
no

bateese
grinned
carrigan
i
was
just
thinking
what
a
handsome
chambermaid

are
so
gentle
so
nice
to
look
at
so
diable
exploded
bateese
dropping
his
dust
cloth
and
bringing
his
huge
hands
down
upon
the
table
with
a
smash
that
almost
wrecked
the
dishes

i

if

carrigan
might
have
judged
bateese
as
that
man
in
these
moments
the
had
worked
himself
up
to
a
ferocious
pitch
his
eyes
rolled
his
wide
mouth
snarled
in
the
virulence
of
its
speech
his
thick
neck
grew
corded
and
his
huge
hands
clenched
menacingly
upon
the
table
yet
david
had
no
fear
he
wanted
to
laugh
but
he
knew
laughter
would
be
the
deadliest
of
insults
to
bateese
just
now
he
remembered
that
the
fierce
as
a
pirate
had
a
touch
as
gentle
as
a
woman
this
man
who
could
choke
an
ox
with
his
monstrous
hands
had
a
moment
before
petted
a
cat
straightened
out
rugs
watered
the
woman
flowers
and
had
dusted
he
was
harmless
now
and
yet
in
the
same
breath
david
sensed
the
fact
that
a
single
word
from
pierre
wife
would
be
sufficient
to
fire
his
brute
strength
into
a
blazing
volcano
of
action
such
a
henchman
was
priceless
under
certain
conditions
and
he
had
brought
a
warning
straight
from
the
woman
i
think
i
understand
what
you
mean
bateese
he
said
she
says
that
i
am
to
make
no
effort
to
leave
this
bateau
that
i
am
to
be
killed
if
i
try
to

bateese
was
a
changed
man
again
david
felt
that
mighty
but
gentle
strength
of
his
arms
as
he
helped
him
to
his
feet
he
was
a
trifle
unsteady
for
a
moment
then
with
the
close
at
his
side
ready
to
catch
him
if
his
legs
gave
way
he
walked
to
one
of
the
windows
and
looked
out
across
the
river
fully
half
a
mile
away
he
saw
the
glow
of
fires
her
camp
he
asked
oui

have
moved
from
the
yes
two
days
down
ze
river

shrugged
his
shoulders
mebby
week
mebby

he
long
way
off
is
he
an
old
man
slowly
bateese
turned
david
about
until
he
was
facing
him

about

warned
no

slowly
back
to
his
bed
will
you
bring
me
my
pack
and
clothes
in
the
morning
i
want
to
shave
and
dress
bateese
was
ahead
of
him
smoothing
the
pillows
and
straightening
out
the
rumpled
his
huge
hands
were
quick
and
capable
as
a
woman
and
david
could
not
keep
himself
from
chuckling
at
this
feminine
ingeniousness
of
the
powerful
once
in
the
crush
of
those
arms
that
were
working
over
his
bed
now
he
thought
and
it
would
be
all
over
with
the
strongest
man
in
n
division
bateese
heard
the
chuckle
and
looked
up
ver
funny
once
more
is
eet
he
demanded
i
was
thinking
bateese
what
will
happen
to
me
if
you
get
me
in
those
arms
when
we
fight
but
it
is
going
to
happen
i
fight
with
my
fists
and
i
going
to
batter
you
up
so
badly
that
nobody
will
recognize
you
for
a
long
time

exploded
bateese
making
a
horrible
grimace
i
choke
you
lak
bear
i
you
ovair
my
i
mash
you
lak
leetle
strawberr
i
he
paused
in
his
task
to
advance
with
a
formidable
gesture
not
now
warned
carrigan
i
still
a
bit
groggy
bateese
he
pointed
down
at
the
bed
i
driving
her
from
that
he
said
i
like
it
is
she
sleepin
over
there
in
the
camp
mebby
an
mebby
not
growled
bateese
you
mak
guess
eh
he
began
extinguishing
the
lights
until
only
the
one
nearest
the
door
was
left
burning
he
did
not
turn
toward
carrigan
or
speak
to
him
again
when
he
went
out
david
heard
the
click
of
a
lock
in
the
door
bateese
had
not
exaggerated
it
was
the
intention
of
pierre
wife
that
he
should
consider
himself
a
prisoner
at
least
for
tonight
he
had
no
desire
to
lie
down
again
there
was
an
unsteadiness
in
his
legs
but
outside
of
that
the
evil
of
his
sickness
no
longer
oppressed
him
the
staff
doctor
at
the
landing
would
probably
have
called
him
a
fool
for
not
convalescing
in
the
usual
prescribed
way
but
carrigan
was
already
beginning
to
feel
the
demand
for
action
in
spite
of
what
physical
effort
he
had
made
his
head
did
not
hurt
him
and
his
mind
was
keenly
alive
he
returned
to
the
window
through
which
he
could
see
the
fires
on
the
western
shore
and
found
no
difficulty
in
opening
it
a
strong
screen
netting
kept
him
from
thrusting
out
his
head
and
shoulders
through
it
came
the
cool
night
breeze
of
the
river
it
seemed
good
to
fill
his
lungs
with
it
again
and
smell
the
fresh
aroma
of
the
forest
it
was
very
dark
and
the
fires
across
the
river
were
brighter
because
of
the
deep
gloom
there
was
no
promise
of
the
moon
in
the
sky
he
could
not
see
a
star
from
far
in
the
west
he
caught
the
low
intonation
of
thunder
carrigan
turned
from
the
window
to
the
end
of
the
cabin
in
which
the
piano
stood
here
too
was
the
second
divan
and
he
saw
the
meaning
now
of
two
curtains
one
at
each
side
of
the
cabin
drawn
together
on
a
taut
wire
stretched
two
inches
under
the
ceiling
they
shut
off
this
end
of
the
bateau
and
turned
at
least
a
third
of
the
cabin
into
the
privacy
of
the
woman
bedroom
with
growing
uneasiness
david
saw
the
evidences
that
this
had
been
her
sleeping
apartment
at
each
side
of
the
piano
was
a
small
door
and
he
opened
one
of
these
just
enough
to
discover
that
it
was
a
wardrobe
closet
a
third
door
opened
on
the
shore
side
of
the
bateau
but
this
was
locked
shut
out
from
the
view
of
the
lower
end
of
the
cabin
by
a
japanese
screen
were
a
small
dresser
and
a
mirror
in
the
dim
illumination
that
came
from
the
distant
lamp
david
bent
over
the
open
sheet
of
music
on
the
piano
it
was
mascagni
ave
maria
his
blood
tingled
his
brain
was
stirred
by
a
new
emotion
a
growing
thing
that
made
him
uneasy
and
filled
him
with
a
strange
restlessness
he
felt
as
though
he
had
come
suddenly
to
the
edge
of
a
great
danger
somewhere
within
him
an
intelligence
seized
upon
it
and
understood
yet
it
was
not
physical
enough
for
him
to
fight
it
was
a
danger
which
crept
up
and
about
him
something
which
he
could
not
see
or
touch
and
yet
which
made
his
heart
beat
faster
and
the
blood
come
into
his
face
it
drew
him
triumphed
over
him
dragged
his
hand
forth
until
his
fingers
closed
upon
a
lacy
crumpled
bit
of
a
handkerchief
that
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
piano
keys
it
was
the
woman
handkerchief
and
like
a
thief
he
raised
it
slowly
it
smelled
faintly
of
crushed
violets
it
was
as
if
she
were
bending
over
him
in
his
sickness
again
and
it
was
her
breath
that
came
to
him
he
was
not
thinking
of
her
as
wife
and
then
sharply
he
caught
himself
and
placed
the
handkerchief
back
on
the
piano
keys
he
tried
to
laugh
at
himself
but
there
was
an
emptiness
where
a
moment
before
there
had
been
that
thrill
of
which
he
was
now
ashamed
he
turned
back
to
the
window
the
thunder
had
come
nearer
it
was
coming
up
fast
out
of
the
west
and
with
it
a
darkness
that
was
like
the
blackness
of
a
pit
a
dead
stillness
was
preceding
it
now
and
in
that
stillness
it
seemed
to
carrigan
that
he
could
hear
the
soapy
slitting
sound
of
the
streaming
flashes
of
electrical
fire
that
blazoned
the
advance
of
the
storm
the
across
the
river
were
dying
down
one
of
them
went
out
as
he
looked
at
it
and
he
stared
into
the
darkness
as
if
trying
to
pierce
distance
and
gloom
to
see
what
sort
of
a
shelter
it
was
that
pierre
wife
had
over
there
and
there
came
over
him
in
these
moments
a
desire
that
was
almost
cowardly
it
was
the
desire
to
escape
to
leave
behind
him
the
memory
of
the
rock
and
of
pierre
wife
and
to
pursue
once
more
his
own
great
adventure
the
quest
of
black
roger
audemard
he
heard
the
rain
coming
at
first
the
sound
of
it
was
like
the
pattering
of
ten
million
tiny
feet
in
dry
leaves
then
suddenly
it
was
like
the
roar
of
an
avalanche
it
was
an
inundation
and
with
it
came
crash
after
crash
of
thunder
and
the
black
skies
were
illumined
by
an
almost
uninterrupted
glare
of
lightning
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
carrigan
had
felt
the
shock
of
such
a
storm
he
closed
the
window
to
keep
the
rain
out
and
after
that
stood
with
his
face
flattened
against
the
glass
staring
over
the
river
the
were
all
gone
now
blotted
out
like
so
many
candles
snuffed
between
thumb
and
forefinger
and
he
shuddered
no
canvas
ever
made
would
keep
that
deluge
out
and
now
there
was
growing
up
a
wind
with
it
the
tents
on
the
other
side
would
be
beaten
down
like
pegged
sheets
of
paper
ripped
up
and
torn
to
pieces
he
imagined
pierre
wife
in
that
tumult
and
distress
the
breath
blown
out
of
her
half
drowned
blinded
by
deluge
and
lightning
broken
and
beaten
because
of
him
thought
of
her
companions
did
not
ease
his
mind
human
hands
were
entirely
inadequate
to
cope
with
a
storm
like
this
that
was
rocking
the
earth
about
him
suddenly
he
went
to
the
door
determined
that
if
bateese
was
outside
he
would
get
some
satisfaction
out
of
him
or
challenge
him
to
a
fight
right
there
he
beat
against
it
first
with
one
fist
and
then
with
both
he
shouted
there
was
no
response
then
he
exerted
his
strength
and
his
weight
against
the
door
it
was
solid
he
was
half
turned
when
his
eyes
discovered
in
a
corner
where
the
lamplight
struck
dimly
his
pack
and
clothes
in
thirty
seconds
he
had
his
pipe
and
tobacco
after
that
for
half
an
hour
he
paced
up
and
down
the
cabin
while
the
storm
crashed
and
thundered
as
if
bent
upon
destroying
all
life
off
the
face
of
the
earth
comforted
by
the
company
of
his
pipe
carrigan
did
not
beat
at
the
door
again
he
waited
and
at
the
end
of
another
the
storm
had
softened
down
into
a
steady
patter
of
rain
the
thunder
had
traveled
east
and
the
lightning
had
gone
with
it
david
opened
the
window
again
the
air
that
came
in
was
soft
and
warm
he
puffed
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
smiled
his
pipe
always
brought
his
good
humor
to
the
surface
even
in
the
worst
places
pierre
wife
had
certainly
had
a
good
soaking
and
in
a
way
the
whole
thing
was
a
bit
funny
he
was
thinking
now
of
a
poor
little
partridge
soaked
to
the
skin
with
its
dragging
pathetically
grinning
he
told
himself
that
it
was
an
insult
to
think
of
her
and
a
partridge
in
the
same
breath
but
the
simile
still
remained
and
he
chuckled
probably
she
was
wringing
out
her
clothes
now
and
the
men
were
cursing
under
their
breath
while
trying
to
light
a
fire
he
watched
for
the
fire
it
failed
to
appear
probably
she
was
hating
him
for
bringing
all
this
discomfort
and
humiliation
upon
her
it
was
not
impossible
that
tomorrow
she
would
give
bateese
permission
to
brain
him
and
pierre
what
would
this
man
her
husband
think
and
do
if
he
knew
that
his
wife
had
given
up
her
bedroom
to
this
stranger
what
complications
might
arise
if
he
knew
it
was
late
past
midnight
when
carrigan
went
to
bed
even
then
he
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
the
patter
of
the
rain
grew
less
and
less
on
the
roof
of
the
bateau
and
as
the
sound
of
it
droned
itself
off
into
nothingness
slumber
came
david
was
conscious
of
the
moment
when
the
rain
ceased
entirely
then
he
slept
at
least
he
must
have
been
very
close
to
sleep
or
had
been
asleep
and
was
returning
for
a
moment
close
to
consciousness
when
he
heard
a
voice
it
came
several
times
before
he
was
roused
enough
to
realize
that
it
was
a
voice
and
then
suddenly
piercing
his
slowly
wakening
brain
almost
with
the
shock
of
one
of
the
thunder
crashes
it
came
to
him
so
distinctly
that
he
found
himself
sitting
up
straight
his
hands
clenched
eyes
staring
in
the
darkness
waiting
for
it
to
come
again
somewhere
very
near
him
in
his
room
within
the
reach
of
his
hands
a
strange
and
indescribable
voice
had
cried
out
in
the
darkness
the
words
which
twice
before
had
beat
themselves
mysteriously
into
david
carrigan
brain
has
any
one
seen
black
roger
audemard
has
any
one
seen
black
roger
audemard
and
david
holding
his
breath
listened
for
the
sound
of
another
breath
which
he
knew
was
in
that
room
ix
for
perhaps
a
minute
carrigan
made
no
sound
that
could
have
been
heard
three
feet
away
from
him
it
was
not
fear
that
held
him
quiet
it
was
something
which
he
could
not
explain
afterward
the
sensation
perhaps
of
one
who
feels
himself
confronted
for
a
moment
by
a
presence
more
potent
than
that
of
flesh
and
blood
black
roger
audemard
three
times
twice
in
his
sickness
some
one
had
cried
out
that
name
in
his
ears
since
the
hour
when
pierre
wife
had
ambushed
him
on
the
white
carpet
of
sand
and
the
voice
was
now
in
his
room
was
it
bateese
inspired
by
some
sort
of
malformed
humor
carrigan
listened
another
minute
passed
he
reached
out
a
hand
and
groped
about
him
very
careful
not
to
make
a
sound
urged
by
the
feeling
that
some
one
was
almost
within
reach
of
him
he
flung
back
his
blanket
and
stood
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
still
he
heard
no
movement
no
soft
footfalls
of
retreat
or
advance
he
lighted
a
match
and
held
it
high
above
his
head
in
its
yellow
illumination
he
could
see
nothing
alive
he
lighted
a
lamp
the
cabin
was
empty
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
went
to
the
window
it
was
still
open
the
voice
had
undoubtedly
come
to
him
through
that
window
and
he
fancied
he
could
see
where
the
screen
netting
was
crushed
a
bit
inward
as
though
a
face
had
pressed
heavily
against
it
outside
the
night
was
beautifully
calm
the
sky
washed
by
storm
was
bright
with
stars
but
there
was
not
a
ripple
of
movement
that
he
could
hear
after
that
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
must
have
been
sleeping
for
some
time
when
the
voice
roused
him
for
it
was
nearly
three
in
spite
of
the
stars
dawn
was
close
at
hand
when
he
looked
out
of
the
window
again
they
were
paler
and
more
distant
he
had
no
intention
of
going
back
to
bed
he
was
restless
and
felt
himself
surrendering
more
and
more
to
the
grip
of
presentiment
it
was
still
early
not
later
than
six
when
bateese
came
in
with
his
breakfast
he
was
surprised
as
he
had
heard
no
movement
or
sound
of
voices
to
give
evidence
of
life
anywhere
near
the
bateau
instantly
he
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
not
bateese
who
had
uttered
the
mysterious
words
of
a
few
hours
ago
for
the
had
evidently
experienced
a
most
uncomfortable
night
he
was
like
a
rat
recently
pulled
out
of
water
his
clothes
hung
upon
him
sodden
and
heavy
his
head
kerchief
dripped
and
his
lank
hair
was
wet
he
slammed
the
breakfast
things
down
on
the
table
and
went
out
again
without
so
much
as
nodding
at
his
prisoner
again
a
sense
of
discomfort
and
shame
swept
over
david
as
he
sat
down
to
breakfast
here
he
was
comfortably
even
luxuriously
housed
while
out
there
somewhere
pierre
lovely
wife
was
drenched
and
even
more
miserable
than
bateese
and
the
breakfast
amazed
him
it
was
not
so
much
the
caribou
tenderloin
rich
in
its
own
red
juice
or
the
potato
or
the
pot
of
coffee
that
was
filling
the
cabin
with
its
aroma
that
roused
his
wonder
but
the
hot
brown
muffins
that
accompanied
the
other
things
muffins
and
after
a
deluge
that
had
drowned
every
square
inch
of
the
earth
how
had
bateese
turned
the
trick
bateese
did
not
return
immediately
for
the
dishes
and
for
half
an
hour
after
he
had
finished
breakfast
carrigan
smoked
his
pipe
and
watched
the
blue
haze
of
fires
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
the
world
was
a
blaze
of
sunlit
glory
his
imagination
carried
him
across
the
river
somewhere
over
there
in
an
open
spot
where
the
sun
was
blazing
jeanne
was
probably
drying
herself
after
the
night
of
storm
there
was
but
little
doubt
in
his
mind
that
she
was
already
heaping
the
ignominy
of
blame
upon
him
that
was
the
woman
of
it
a
knock
at
his
door
drew
him
about
it
was
a
light
quick
tap
tap
tap
not
like
the
fist
of
either
bateese
or
nepapinas
in
another
moment
the
door
swung
open
and
in
the
flood
of
sunlight
that
poured
into
the
cabin
stood
pierre
wife
it
was
not
her
presence
but
the
beauty
of
her
that
held
him
spellbound
it
was
a
sort
of
shock
after
the
vivid
imaginings
of
his
mind
in
which
he
had
seen
her
beaten
and
tortured
by
storm
her
hair
glowing
in
the
sun
and
piled
up
in
shining
coils
on
the
crown
of
her
head
was
not
wet
she
was
not
the
little
partridge
that
had
passed
in
tragic
bedragglement
through
his
mind
storm
had
not
touched
her
her
cheeks
were
soft
with
the
warm
flush
of
long
hours
of
sleep
when
she
came
in
her
lips
greeting
him
with
a
little
smile
all
that
he
had
built
up
for
himself
in
the
hours
of
the
night
crumbled
away
in
dust
again
he
forgot
for
a
moment
that
she
was
wife
she
was
woman
and
as
he
looked
upon
her
now
the
most
adorable
woman
in
all
the
world
you
are
better
this
morning
she
said
real
pleasure
shone
in
her
eyes
she
had
left
the
door
open
so
that
the
sun
filled
the
room
i
think
the
storm
helped
you
was
it
splendid
david
swallowed
hard
quite
splendid
he
managed
to
say
have
you
seen
bateese
this
morning
a
little
note
of
laughter
came
into
her
throat
yes
i
do
think
he
liked
it
he
does
understand
why
i
love
storms
did
you
sleep
well
carrigan
an
hour
or
two
i
think
i
was
worrying
about
you
i
did
like
the
thought
that
i
had
turned
you
out
into
the
storm
but
it
does
seem
to
have
touched
you
no
i
was
there
quite
comfortable
she
nodded
to
the
forward
bulkhead
of
the
cabin
beyond
the
wardrobe
closets
and
the
piano
there
is
a
little
and
kitchenette
ahead
she
explained
did
bateese
tell
you
that
no
he
did
i
asked
him
where
you
were
and
i
think
he
told
me
to
shut
up
bateese
is
very
odd
said
pierre
wife
he
is
exceedingly
jealous
of
me
david
even
when
i
was
a
baby
and
he
carried
me
about
in
his
arms
he
was
just
that
way
bateese
you
know
is
older
than
he
appears
he
is
she
was
moving
about
quite
as
if
his
presence
was
in
no
way
going
to
disturb
her
usual
duties
of
the
day
she
rearranged
the
damask
curtains
which
he
had
crumpled
with
his
hands
placed
two
or
three
chairs
in
their
usual
places
and
moved
from
this
to
that
with
the
air
of
a
housewife
who
is
in
the
habit
of
brushing
up
a
bit
in
the
morning
she
seemed
not
at
all
embarrassed
because
he
was
her
prisoner
nor
uncomfortably
restrained
because
of
the
message
she
had
sent
to
him
by
bateese
she
was
warmly
and
gloriously
human
in
her
apparent
unconcern
at
his
presence
he
found
himself
sweating
inwardly
a
bit
nervously
he
struck
a
match
to
light
his
pipe
then
extinguished
it
she
noticed
what
he
had
done
you
may
smoke
she
said
with
that
little
note
in
her
throat
which
he
loved
to
hear
like
the
faintest
melody
of
laughter
that
did
not
quite
reach
her
lips
pierre
smokes
a
great
deal
and
i
like
it
she
opened
a
drawer
in
the
and
came
to
him
with
a
box
half
filled
with
cigars
pierre
prefers
these
on
occasions
she
said
do
you
his
fingers
seemed
all
thumbs
as
he
took
a
cigar
from
the
proffered
box
he
cursed
himself
because
his
tongue
felt
thick
perhaps
it
was
his
silence
betraying
something
of
his
mental
clumsiness
that
brought
a
faint
flush
of
color
into
her
cheeks
he
noted
that
and
also
that
the
top
of
her
shining
head
came
just
about
to
his
chin
and
that
her
mouth
and
throat
looking
down
on
them
were
bewitchingly
soft
and
sweet
and
what
she
said
when
her
eyes
opened
wide
and
beautiful
on
him
again
was
like
a
knife
cutting
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
his
thoughts
in
the
evening
i
love
to
sit
at
pierre
feet
and
watch
him
smoke
she
said
i
am
glad
it
does
annoy
you
because
i
like
to
smoke
he
replied
lamely
she
placed
the
box
on
the
little
reading
table
and
looked
at
his
breakfast
things
you
like
muffins
too
i
was
up
early
this
morning
making
them
for
you
you
made
them
he
demanded
as
if
her
words
were
a
most
amazing
revelation
to
him
surely
david
i
make
them
every
morning
for
pierre
he
is
very
fond
of
them
he
says
the
third
nicest
thing
about
me
is
my
muffins
and
the
other
two
asked
david
are
pierre
little
secrets
she
laughed
softly
the
color
deepening
in
her
cheeks
it
would
be
fair
to
tell
you
would
it
perhaps
it
would
he
said
slowly
but
there
are
one
or
two
other
things
boulain
you
may
call
me
jeanne
or
if
you
care
to
she
interrupted
him
it
will
be
quite
all
right
she
was
picking
up
the
breakfast
dishes
not
at
all
perturbed
by
the
fact
that
she
was
offering
him
a
privilege
which
had
the
effect
of
quickening
his
pulse
for
a
moment
or
two
thank
you
he
said
i
do
mind
telling
you
it
is
going
to
be
difficult
for
me
to
do
that
because
well
this
is
a
most
unusual
situation
is
it
in
spite
of
all
your
kindness
including
what
was
probably
your
endeavor
to
put
an
end
to
my
earthly
miseries
behind
the
rock
i
believe
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
give
me
some
kind
of
explanation
do
you
did
bateese
explain
to
you
last
night
she
asked
facing
him
he
brought
a
message
from
you
to
the
effect
that
i
was
a
prisoner
that
i
must
make
no
attempt
to
escape
and
that
if
i
did
try
to
escape
you
had
given
your
men
instructions
to
kill
me
she
nodded
quite
seriously
that
is
right
david
his
face
flamed
then
i
am
a
prisoner
you
threaten
me
with
death
i
shall
treat
you
very
nicely
if
you
make
no
attempt
to
escape
david
is
that
fair
fair
he
cried
choking
back
an
explosion
that
would
have
vented
itself
on
a
man
do
you
realize
what
has
happened
do
you
know
that
according
to
every
law
of
god
and
man
i
should
arrest
you
and
give
you
over
to
the
law
is
it
possible
that
you
do
comprehend
my
own
duty
what
i
must
do
if
he
had
noticed
he
would
have
seen
that
there
was
no
longer
the
flush
of
color
in
her
cheeks
but
her
eyes
looking
straight
at
him
were
tranquil
and
unexcited
she
nodded
that
is
why
you
must
remain
a
prisoner
david
it
is
because
i
do
realize
i
shall
not
tell
you
why
that
happened
behind
the
rock
and
if
you
ask
me
i
shall
refuse
to
talk
to
you
if
i
let
you
go
now
you
would
probably
have
me
arrested
and
put
in
jail
so
i
must
keep
you
until
pierre
comes
i
do
know
what
to
do
except
to
keep
you
and
not
let
you
escape
until
then
what
would
you
do
the
question
was
so
honest
so
like
a
question
that
might
have
been
asked
by
a
puzzled
child
that
his
argument
for
the
law
was
struck
dead
he
stared
into
the
pale
face
the
beautiful
waiting
eyes
saw
the
pathetic
intertwining
of
her
slim
fingers
and
suddenly
he
was
grinning
in
that
big
honest
way
which
made
people
love
dave
carrigan
you
doing
absolutely
right
he
said
a
swift
change
came
in
her
face
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
filled
with
a
sudden
glow
that
made
the
little
in
them
dance
like
tiny
flecks
of
gold
from
your
point
of
view
you
are
right
he
repeated
and
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
escape
until
i
have
talked
with
pierre
but
i
quite
see
just
now
how
he
is
going
to
help
the
situation
he
will
she
assured
him
confidently
you
seem
to
have
an
unlimited
faith
in
pierre
he
replied
a
little
grimly
yes
david
he
is
the
most
wonderful
man
in
the
world
and
he
will
know
what
to
do
david
shrugged
his
shoulders
perhaps
in
some
nice
quiet
place
he
will
follow
the
advice
bateese
gave
you
tie
a
stone
round
my
neck
and
sink
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
perhaps
but
i
do
think
he
will
do
that
i
should
object
to
it
oh
you
would
yes
pierre
is
big
and
strong
afraid
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
he
will
do
anything
for
me
i
do
think
he
would
kill
you
if
i
asked
him
not
to
she
turned
to
resume
her
task
of
cleaning
up
the
breakfast
things
with
a
sudden
movement
david
swung
one
of
the
big
chairs
close
to
her
please
sit
down
he
commanded
i
can
talk
to
you
better
that
way
as
an
officer
of
the
law
it
is
my
duty
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
it
rests
in
your
power
to
answer
all
of
them
or
none
of
them
i
have
given
you
my
word
not
to
act
until
i
have
seen
pierre
and
i
shall
keep
that
promise
but
when
we
do
meet
i
shall
act
largely
on
the
strength
of
what
you
tell
me
during
the
next
tea
minutes
please
sit
down
x
in
that
big
deep
chair
which
must
have
been
pierre
own
sat
facing
carrigan
between
its
great
arms
her
slim
little
figure
seemed
diminutive
and
out
of
place
her
brown
eyes
were
level
and
clear
waiting
they
were
not
warm
or
nervous
but
so
coolly
and
calmly
beautiful
that
they
disturbed
carrigan
she
raised
her
hands
her
slim
fingers
crumpling
for
a
moment
in
the
soft
thick
coils
of
her
hair
that
little
movement
the
unconscious
feminism
of
it
the
way
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
afterward
disturbed
carrigan
even
more
what
a
glory
on
earth
it
must
be
to
possess
a
woman
like
that
the
thought
made
him
uneasy
and
she
sat
waiting
a
vivid
against
the
warm
coloring
of
the
upholstered
chair
when
you
shot
me
he
began
i
saw
you
first
standing
over
me
i
thought
you
had
come
to
finish
me
it
was
then
that
i
saw
something
in
your
face
horror
amazement
as
though
you
had
done
something
you
did
not
know
you
were
doing
you
see
i
want
to
be
charitable
i
want
to
understand
i
want
to
excuse
you
if
i
can
wo
you
tell
me
why
you
shot
me
and
why
that
change
came
over
you
when
you
saw
me
lying
there
no
david
i
shall
not
tell
she
was
not
antagonistic
or
defiant
her
voice
was
not
raised
nor
did
it
betray
an
unusual
emotion
it
was
simply
decisive
and
the
unflinching
steadiness
of
her
eyes
and
the
way
in
which
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
gave
to
it
an
unqualified
definiteness
you
mean
that
i
must
make
my
own
guess
she
nodded
or
get
it
out
of
st
pierre
if
pierre
wishes
to
tell
you
yes
well
he
leaned
a
little
toward
her
after
that
you
dragged
me
up
into
the
shade
dressed
my
wound
and
made
me
comfortable
in
a
hazy
sort
of
way
i
knew
what
was
going
on
and
a
curious
thing
happened
at
times
he
leaned
still
a
little
nearer
to
her
at
times
there
seemed
to
be
two
of
you
he
was
not
looking
at
her
hands
or
he
would
have
seen
her
fingers
slowly
tighten
in
her
lap
you
were
badly
hurt
she
said
it
is
not
strange
that
you
should
have
imagined
things
david
and
i
seemed
to
hear
two
voices
he
went
on
she
made
no
answer
but
continued
to
look
at
him
steadily
and
the
other
had
hair
that
was
like
copper
and
gold
fire
in
the
sun
i
would
see
your
face
and
then
hers
again
and
again
and
since
then
i
have
thought
i
was
a
heavy
load
for
your
hands
to
drag
up
through
that
sand
to
the
shade
alone
she
held
up
her
two
hands
looking
at
them
they
are
strong
she
said
they
are
small
he
insisted
and
i
doubt
if
they
could
drag
me
across
this
floor
for
the
first
time
the
quiet
of
her
eyes
gave
way
to
a
warm
fire
it
was
hard
work
she
said
and
the
note
in
her
voice
gave
him
warning
that
he
was
approaching
the
again
bateese
says
i
was
a
fool
for
doing
it
and
if
you
saw
two
of
me
or
three
or
four
it
matter
are
you
through
questioning
me
david
if
so
i
have
a
number
of
things
to
do
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
no
i
am
not
through
but
why
ask
you
questions
if
you
wo
answer
them
i
simply
can
not
you
must
wait
for
your
husband
yes
for
st
pierre
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
said
i
raved
about
a
number
of
things
when
i
was
sick
did
i
you
did
and
especially
about
what
you
thought
happened
in
the
sand
you
called
this
this
other
person
the
fire
goddess
you
were
so
near
dying
that
of
course
it
was
amusing
otherwise
it
would
have
been
you
see
my
hair
is
black
almost
again
in
a
quick
movement
her
fingers
were
crumpling
the
lustrous
coils
on
the
crown
of
her
head
why
do
you
say
he
asked
because
pierre
has
often
told
me
that
when
i
am
in
the
sun
there
are
red
fires
in
it
and
the
sun
was
very
bright
that
afternoon
in
the
sand
david
i
think
i
understand
he
nodded
and
i
rather
glad
too
i
like
to
know
that
it
was
you
who
dragged
me
up
into
the
shade
after
trying
to
kill
me
it
proves
you
are
quite
so
savage
as
carmin
fanchet
she
interrupted
him
softly
you
talked
about
her
in
your
sickness
david
it
made
me
terribly
afraid
of
you
so
much
so
that
at
times
i
almost
wondered
if
bateese
was
right
it
made
me
understand
what
would
happen
to
me
if
i
should
let
you
go
what
terrible
thing
did
she
do
to
you
what
could
she
have
done
more
terrible
than
i
have
done
is
that
why
you
have
given
your
men
orders
to
kill
me
if
i
try
to
escape
he
asked
because
i
talked
about
this
woman
carmin
fanchet
yes
it
is
because
of
carmin
fanchet
that
i
am
keeping
you
for
pierre
she
acknowledged
if
you
had
no
mercy
for
her
you
could
have
none
for
me
what
terrible
thing
did
she
do
to
you
nothing
to
me
he
said
feeling
that
she
was
putting
him
where
the
earth
was
unsteady
under
his
feet
again
but
her
brother
was
a
criminal
of
the
worst
sort
and
i
was
convinced
then
and
am
convinced
now
that
his
sister
was
a
partner
in
his
crimes
she
was
very
beautiful
and
that
i
think
was
what
saved
her
he
was
fingering
his
unlighted
cigar
as
he
spoke
when
he
looked
up
he
was
surprised
at
the
swift
change
that
had
come
into
the
face
of
pierre
wife
her
cheeks
were
flaming
and
there
were
burning
fires
screened
behind
the
long
lashes
of
her
eyes
but
her
voice
was
unchanged
it
was
without
a
quiver
that
betrayed
the
emotion
which
had
sent
the
hot
flush
into
her
face
then
you
judged
her
without
absolute
knowledge
of
fact
you
judged
her
as
you
hinted
in
your
fever
because
she
fought
so
desperately
to
save
a
brother
who
had
gone
wrong
i
believe
she
was
bad
the
long
lashes
fell
lower
like
fringes
of
velvet
closing
over
the
fires
in
her
eyes
but
you
did
know
not
absolutely
he
conceded
but
investigations
might
have
shown
her
to
be
one
of
the
most
wonderful
women
that
ever
lived
david
it
is
not
hard
to
fight
for
a
good
brother
but
if
he
is
bad
it
may
take
an
angel
to
do
it
he
stared
thoughts
tangling
themselves
in
his
head
a
slow
shame
crept
over
him
she
had
cornered
him
she
had
convicted
him
of
unfairness
to
the
one
creature
on
earth
his
strength
and
his
manhood
were
bound
to
protect
a
woman
she
had
convicted
him
of
judging
without
fact
and
in
his
head
a
voice
seemed
to
cry
out
to
him
what
did
carmin
fanchet
ever
do
to
you
he
rose
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
stood
at
the
back
of
his
chair
his
hands
gripping
the
top
of
it
maybe
you
are
right
he
said
maybe
i
was
wrong
i
remember
now
that
when
i
got
fanchet
i
manacled
him
and
she
sat
beside
him
all
through
that
first
night
i
did
intend
to
sleep
but
i
was
tired
and
did
i
must
have
slept
for
an
hour
and
she
roused
me
trying
to
get
the
key
to
the
handcuffs
she
had
the
opportunity
then
to
kill
me
triumph
swept
over
the
face
that
was
looking
up
at
him
yes
she
could
have
killed
you
while
you
slept
but
she
did
why
i
do
know
perhaps
she
had
the
idea
of
getting
the
key
and
letting
her
brother
do
the
job
two
or
three
days
later
i
am
convinced
she
would
not
have
hesitated
i
caught
her
twice
trying
to
steal
my
gun
and
a
third
time
late
at
night
when
we
were
within
a
day
or
two
of
athabasca
landing
she
almost
got
me
with
a
club
so
i
concede
that
she
never
did
anything
very
terrible
to
me
but
i
am
sure
that
she
tried
especially
toward
the
last
and
because
she
failed
she
hated
you
and
because
she
hated
you
something
was
warped
inside
you
and
you
made
up
your
mind
she
should
be
punished
along
with
her
brother
you
did
look
at
it
from
a
woman
viewpoint
a
woman
will
fight
and
kill
to
save
one
she
loves
she
tried
perhaps
and
failed
the
result
was
that
her
brother
was
killed
by
the
law
was
not
that
enough
was
it
fair
or
honest
to
destroy
her
simply
because
you
thought
she
might
be
a
partner
in
her
brother
crimes
it
is
rather
strange
he
replied
a
moment
of
indecision
in
his
voice
mcvane
the
superintendent
asked
me
that
same
question
i
thought
he
was
touched
by
her
beauty
and
i
sorry
very
sorry
that
i
talked
about
her
when
i
was
sick
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
am
a
bad
sort
that
way
i
going
to
think
about
it
i
going
over
the
whole
thing
again
from
the
time
i
manacled
fanchet
and
if
i
find
that
i
was
wrong
and
i
ever
meet
carmin
fanchet
again
i
shall
not
be
ashamed
to
get
down
on
my
knees
and
ask
her
pardon
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
the
name
which
she
had
given
him
permission
to
use
and
she
noticed
it
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
a
flashing
instant
in
which
the
indefinable
confession
of
it
was
in
her
face
as
though
his
use
of
it
had
surprised
her
or
pleased
her
or
both
then
it
was
gone
she
did
not
answer
but
rose
from
the
big
chair
and
went
to
the
window
and
stood
with
her
back
toward
him
looking
out
over
the
river
and
then
suddenly
they
heard
a
voice
it
was
the
voice
he
had
heard
twice
in
his
sickness
the
voice
that
had
roused
him
from
his
sleep
last
night
crying
out
in
his
room
for
black
roger
audemard
it
came
to
him
distinctly
through
the
open
door
in
a
low
and
moaning
monotone
he
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
the
slim
figure
of
pierre
wife
and
he
saw
a
little
tremor
pass
through
her
now
i
heard
that
voice
again
last
night
said
david
it
was
in
this
cabin
asking
for
black
roger
audemard
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
and
he
also
turned
so
that
he
was
looking
at
the
open
door
of
the
cabin
the
sun
pouring
through
in
a
golden
flood
was
all
at
once
darkened
and
in
the
doorway
framed
vividly
against
the
day
was
the
figure
of
a
man
a
tense
breath
came
to
carrigan
lips
at
first
he
felt
a
shock
then
an
overwhelming
sense
of
curiosity
and
of
pity
the
man
was
terribly
deformed
his
back
and
massive
shoulders
were
so
twisted
and
bent
that
he
stood
no
higher
than
a
boy
yet
standing
straight
he
would
have
been
six
feet
tall
if
an
inch
and
splendidly
proportioned
and
in
that
same
breath
with
which
shock
and
pity
came
to
him
david
knew
that
it
was
accident
and
not
birth
that
had
malformed
the
great
body
that
stood
like
a
crouching
animal
in
the
open
door
at
first
he
saw
only
the
grotesqueness
of
it
the
long
arms
that
almost
touched
the
floor
the
broken
back
the
twisted
shoulders
and
then
with
a
deeper
thrill
he
saw
nothing
of
these
things
but
only
the
face
and
the
head
of
the
man
there
was
something
about
them
fastened
there
between
the
crippled
shoulders
it
was
not
beauty
but
strength
the
strength
of
rock
of
carven
granite
as
if
each
feature
had
been
chiseled
out
of
something
imperishable
and
everlasting
yet
lacking
strangely
and
mysteriously
the
warm
illumination
that
comes
from
a
living
soul
the
man
was
not
old
nor
was
he
young
and
he
did
not
seem
to
see
carrigan
who
stood
nearest
to
him
he
was
looking
at
pierre
wife
the
look
which
david
saw
in
her
face
was
infinitely
tender
she
was
smiling
at
the
misshapen
hulk
in
the
door
as
she
might
have
smiled
at
a
little
child
and
david
looking
back
at
the
wide
eyes
of
the
man
saw
the
slumbering
fire
of
a
worship
in
them
they
shifted
slowly
taking
in
the
cabin
questing
seeking
searching
for
something
which
they
could
not
find
the
lips
moved
and
again
he
heard
that
weird
and
mysterious
monotone
as
if
the
plaintive
voice
of
a
child
were
coming
out
of
the
huge
frame
of
the
man
crying
out
as
it
had
cried
last
night
in
another
moment
pierre
wife
was
at
the
deformed
giant
side
she
seemed
tall
beside
him
she
put
her
hands
to
his
head
and
brushed
back
the
grizzled
black
hair
laughing
softly
into
his
upturned
face
her
eyes
shining
and
a
strange
glow
in
her
cheeks
carrigan
looking
at
them
felt
his
heart
stand
still
was
this
man
pierre
the
thought
came
like
a
lightning
flash
and
went
as
quickly
it
was
impossible
and
inconceivable
and
yet
there
was
something
more
than
pity
in
the
voice
of
the
woman
who
was
speaking
now
no
no
we
have
not
seen
him
andre
we
have
not
seen
black
roger
audemard
if
he
comes
i
will
call
you
i
promise
michiwan
i
will
call
you
she
was
stroking
his
bearded
cheek
and
then
she
put
an
arm
about
his
twisted
shoulders
and
slowly
she
turned
so
that
in
a
moment
or
two
they
were
facing
the
sun
and
it
seemed
to
carrigan
that
she
was
talking
and
sobbing
and
laughing
in
the
same
breath
as
that
great
broken
hulk
of
a
man
moved
out
slowly
from
under
the
caress
of
her
arm
and
went
on
his
way
for
a
space
she
looked
after
him
then
in
a
swift
movement
she
closed
the
door
and
faced
carrigan
she
did
not
speak
but
waited
her
head
was
high
she
was
breathing
quickly
the
tenderness
that
a
moment
before
had
filled
her
face
was
gone
and
in
her
eyes
was
the
blaze
of
fighting
fires
as
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
to
give
voice
to
what
she
knew
was
passing
in
his
mind
xi
for
a
space
there
was
silence
between
carrigan
and
pierre
wife
he
knew
what
she
was
thinking
as
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
door
waiting
half
defiantly
her
cheeks
still
flushed
her
eyes
bright
with
the
anticipation
of
battle
she
was
ready
to
fight
for
the
broken
creature
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
she
expected
him
to
give
no
quarter
in
his
questioning
of
her
to
corner
her
if
he
could
to
demand
of
her
why
the
deformed
giant
had
spoken
the
name
of
the
man
he
was
after
black
roger
audemard
the
truth
hammered
in
david
brain
it
had
not
been
a
delusion
of
his
fevered
mind
after
all
it
was
not
a
possible
deception
of
the
as
he
had
thought
last
night
chance
had
brought
him
face
to
face
with
the
mystery
of
black
roger
pierre
wife
waiting
for
him
to
speak
was
in
some
way
associated
with
that
mystery
and
the
cripple
was
asking
for
the
man
mcvane
had
told
him
to
bring
in
dead
or
alive
yet
he
did
not
question
her
he
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
from
where
had
stood
a
few
moments
before
the
day
was
glorious
on
the
far
shore
he
saw
life
where
last
camp
had
been
men
were
moving
about
close
to
the
water
and
a
york
boat
was
putting
out
slowly
into
the
stream
close
under
the
window
moved
a
canoe
with
a
single
occupant
it
was
andre
the
broken
man
with
powerful
strokes
he
was
paddling
across
the
river
his
deformity
was
scarcely
noticeable
in
the
canoe
his
bare
head
and
black
beard
shone
in
the
sun
and
between
his
great
shoulders
his
head
looked
more
than
ever
to
carrigan
like
the
head
of
a
carven
god
and
this
man
like
a
mighty
tree
stricken
by
lightning
his
mind
gone
was
yet
a
thing
that
was
more
than
mere
flesh
and
blood
to
boulain
david
turned
toward
her
her
attitude
was
changed
it
was
no
longer
one
of
proud
defiance
she
had
expected
to
defend
herself
from
something
and
he
had
given
her
no
occasion
for
defense
she
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
from
him
and
he
nodded
toward
the
window
he
is
going
away
in
a
canoe
i
am
afraid
you
did
want
me
to
see
him
and
i
am
sorry
i
happened
to
be
here
when
he
came
i
made
no
effort
to
keep
him
away
david
perhaps
i
wanted
you
to
see
him
and
i
thought
when
you
did
she
hesitated
you
expected
me
to
crucify
you
if
necessary
to
learn
the
truth
of
what
he
knows
about
roger
audemard
he
said
and
you
were
ready
to
fight
back
but
i
am
not
going
to
question
you
unless
you
give
me
permission
i
am
glad
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
beginning
to
have
faith
in
you
david
you
have
promised
not
to
try
to
escape
and
i
believe
you
will
you
also
promise
not
to
ask
me
questions
which
i
can
not
answer
until
pierre
comes
i
will
try
she
came
up
to
him
slowly
and
stood
facing
him
so
near
that
she
could
have
reached
out
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
pierre
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
the
scarlet
police
she
said
looking
at
him
quietly
and
steadily
he
says
that
the
men
who
wear
the
red
jackets
never
play
low
tricks
and
that
they
come
after
a
man
squarely
and
openly
he
says
they
are
men
and
many
times
he
has
told
me
wonderful
stories
of
the
things
they
have
done
he
calls
it
the
game
and
i
going
to
ask
you
david
will
you
play
square
with
me
if
i
give
you
the
freedom
of
the
bateau
of
the
boats
even
of
the
shore
will
you
wait
for
pierre
and
play
the
rest
of
the
game
out
with
him
man
to
man
carrigan
bowed
his
head
slightly
yes
i
will
wait
and
finish
the
game
with
st
pierre
he
saw
a
quick
throb
come
and
go
in
her
white
throat
and
with
a
sudden
impulsive
movement
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
for
a
moment
he
held
it
close
her
little
fingers
tightened
about
his
own
and
the
warm
thrill
of
them
set
his
blood
leaping
with
the
thing
he
was
fighting
down
she
was
so
near
that
he
could
feel
the
throb
of
her
body
for
an
instant
she
bowed
her
head
and
the
sweet
perfume
of
her
hair
was
in
his
nostrils
the
lustrous
beauty
of
it
close
under
his
lips
gently
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
stood
back
from
him
to
carrigan
she
was
like
a
young
girl
now
it
was
the
loveliness
of
girlhood
he
saw
in
the
flush
of
her
face
and
in
the
gladness
that
was
flaming
unashamed
in
her
eyes
i
am
not
frightened
any
more
she
exclaimed
her
voice
trembling
a
bit
when
pierre
comes
i
shall
tell
him
everything
and
then
you
may
ask
the
questions
and
he
will
answer
and
he
will
not
cheat
he
will
play
square
you
will
love
pierre
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
what
happened
behind
the
rock
she
made
a
little
gesture
toward
the
door
everything
is
free
to
you
out
there
now
she
added
i
shall
tell
bateese
and
the
others
when
we
are
tied
up
you
may
go
ashore
and
we
will
forget
all
that
has
happened
david
we
will
forget
until
pierre
comes
st
pierre
he
groaned
if
there
were
no
st
pierre
i
should
be
lost
she
broke
in
quickly
i
should
want
to
die
through
the
open
window
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
it
was
the
weird
monotone
of
andre
the
broken
man
went
to
the
window
and
david
following
her
looked
over
her
head
again
so
near
that
his
lips
almost
touched
her
hair
andre
had
come
back
he
was
watching
two
york
boats
that
were
heading
for
the
bateau
you
heard
him
asking
for
black
roger
audemard
she
said
it
is
strange
i
know
how
it
must
have
shocked
you
when
he
stood
like
that
in
the
door
his
mind
like
his
body
is
a
wreck
david
years
ago
after
a
great
storm
pierre
found
him
in
the
forest
a
tree
had
fallen
on
him
pierre
carried
him
in
on
his
shoulders
he
lived
but
he
has
always
been
like
that
pierre
loves
him
and
poor
andre
worships
pierre
and
follows
him
about
like
a
dog
his
brain
is
gone
he
does
not
know
what
his
name
is
and
we
call
him
andre
and
always
day
and
night
he
is
asking
that
same
question
any
one
seen
black
roger
audemard
sometime
if
you
will
david
i
should
like
to
have
you
tell
me
what
it
is
so
terrible
that
you
know
about
roger
audemard
the
york
boats
were
across
the
river
and
from
them
came
a
sudden
burst
of
wild
song
david
could
make
out
six
men
in
each
boat
their
oars
flashing
in
the
morning
sun
to
the
rhythm
of
their
chant
looked
up
at
him
suddenly
and
in
her
face
and
eyes
he
saw
what
the
starry
gloom
of
evening
had
half
hidden
from
him
in
those
thrilling
moments
when
they
shot
through
the
rapids
of
the
holy
ghost
she
was
girl
now
he
did
not
think
of
her
as
woman
he
did
not
think
of
her
as
pierre
wife
in
that
upward
glance
of
her
eyes
was
something
that
thrilled
him
to
the
depth
of
his
soul
she
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
dropped
a
curtain
from
between
herself
and
him
her
red
lips
trembled
she
smiled
at
him
and
then
she
faced
the
river
again
and
he
leaned
a
little
forward
so
that
a
breath
of
wind
floated
a
shimmering
tress
of
her
hair
against
his
cheek
an
irresistible
impulse
seized
upon
him
he
leaned
still
nearer
to
her
holding
his
breath
until
his
lips
softly
touched
one
of
the
velvety
coils
of
her
hair
and
then
he
stepped
back
shame
swept
over
him
his
heart
rose
and
choked
him
and
his
fists
were
clenched
at
his
side
she
had
not
noticed
what
he
had
done
and
she
seemed
to
him
like
a
bird
yearning
to
fly
out
through
the
window
throbbing
with
the
desire
to
answer
the
chanting
song
that
came
over
the
water
and
then
she
was
smiling
up
again
into
his
face
hardened
with
the
struggle
which
he
was
making
with
himself
my
people
are
happy
she
cried
even
in
storm
they
laugh
and
sing
listen
they
are
singing
la
derniere
domaine
that
is
our
song
it
is
what
we
call
our
home
away
up
there
in
the
lost
wilderness
where
people
never
come
the
last
domain
their
wives
and
sweethearts
and
families
are
up
there
and
they
are
happy
in
knowing
that
today
we
shall
travel
a
few
miles
nearer
to
them
they
are
not
like
your
people
in
montreal
and
ottawa
and
quebec
david
they
are
like
children
and
yet
they
are
glorious
children
she
ran
to
the
wall
and
took
down
the
banner
of
pierre
boulain
pierre
is
behind
us
she
explained
he
is
coming
down
with
a
raft
of
timber
such
as
we
can
not
get
in
our
country
and
we
are
waiting
for
him
but
each
day
we
must
float
down
with
the
stream
a
few
miles
nearer
the
homes
of
my
people
it
makes
them
happier
even
though
it
is
but
a
few
miles
they
are
coming
now
for
my
bateau
we
shall
travel
slowly
and
it
will
be
wonderful
on
a
day
like
this
it
will
do
you
good
to
come
outside
david
with
me
would
you
care
for
that
or
would
you
rather
be
alone
in
her
face
there
was
no
longer
the
old
restraint
on
her
lips
was
the
witchery
of
a
in
her
eyes
a
glow
that
flamed
the
blood
in
his
veins
it
was
not
a
flash
of
coquetry
it
was
something
deeper
and
warmer
than
that
something
real
a
new
boulain
telling
him
plainly
that
she
wanted
him
to
come
he
did
not
know
that
his
hands
were
still
clenched
at
his
side
perhaps
she
knew
but
her
eyes
did
not
leave
his
face
eyes
that
were
repeating
the
invitation
of
her
lips
openly
asking
him
not
to
refuse
i
shall
be
happy
to
come
he
said
the
words
fell
out
of
him
numbly
he
scarcely
heard
them
or
knew
what
he
was
saying
yet
he
was
conscious
of
the
unnatural
note
in
his
voice
he
did
not
know
he
was
betraying
himself
beyond
that
did
not
see
the
deepening
of
the
flush
in
the
cheeks
of
pierre
wife
he
picked
up
his
pipe
from
the
table
and
moved
to
accompany
her
you
must
wait
a
little
while
she
said
and
her
hand
rested
for
an
instant
upon
his
arm
its
touch
was
as
light
as
the
touch
of
his
lips
had
been
against
her
shining
hair
but
he
felt
it
in
every
nerve
of
his
body
nepapinas
is
making
a
special
lotion
for
your
hurt
i
will
send
him
in
and
then
you
may
come
the
wild
chant
of
the
rivermen
was
near
as
she
turned
to
the
door
from
it
she
looked
back
at
him
swiftly
they
are
happy
david
she
repeated
softly
and
i
too
am
happy
i
am
no
longer
afraid
and
the
world
is
beautiful
again
can
you
guess
why
it
is
because
you
have
given
me
your
promise
david
and
because
i
believe
you
and
then
she
was
gone
for
many
minutes
he
did
not
move
the
chanting
of
the
rivermen
a
sudden
wilder
shout
the
voices
of
men
and
after
that
the
grating
of
something
alongside
the
bateau
came
to
him
like
sounds
from
another
world
within
himself
there
was
a
crash
greater
than
that
of
physical
things
it
was
the
truth
breaking
upon
him
truth
surging
over
him
like
the
waves
of
a
sea
breaking
down
the
barriers
he
had
set
up
inundating
him
with
a
force
that
was
mightier
than
his
own
will
a
voice
in
his
soul
was
crying
out
the
truth
that
above
all
else
in
the
world
he
wanted
to
reach
out
his
arms
to
this
glorious
creature
who
was
the
wife
of
pierre
this
woman
who
had
tried
to
kill
him
and
was
sorry
he
knew
that
it
was
not
desire
for
beauty
it
was
the
worship
which
pierre
himself
must
have
for
this
woman
who
was
his
wife
and
the
shock
of
it
was
like
a
conflagration
sweeping
through
him
leaving
him
dead
and
shriven
like
the
crucified
trees
standing
in
the
wake
of
a
fire
a
breath
that
was
almost
a
cry
came
from
him
and
his
fists
knotted
until
they
were
purple
she
was
pierre
wife
and
he
david
carrigan
proud
of
his
honor
proud
of
the
strength
that
made
him
man
had
dared
covet
her
in
this
hour
when
her
husband
was
gone
he
stared
at
the
closed
door
beginning
to
cry
out
against
himself
and
over
him
there
swept
slowly
and
terribly
another
thing
the
shame
of
his
weakness
the
hopelessness
of
the
thing
that
for
a
space
had
eaten
into
him
and
consumed
him
and
as
he
stared
the
door
opened
and
nepapinas
came
in
xii
during
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
david
was
as
silent
as
the
old
indian
doctor
he
was
conscious
of
no
pain
when
nepapinas
took
off
his
bandage
and
bathed
his
head
in
the
lotion
he
had
brought
before
a
fresh
bandage
was
put
on
he
looked
at
himself
for
a
moment
in
the
mirror
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
his
wound
and
he
expected
to
find
himself
marked
with
a
disfiguring
scar
to
his
surprise
there
was
no
sign
of
his
hurt
except
a
slightly
inflamed
spot
above
his
temple
he
stared
at
nepapinas
and
there
was
no
need
of
the
question
that
was
in
his
mind
the
old
indian
understood
and
his
face
cracked
and
crinkled
in
a
grin
bullet
hit
a
piece
of
rock
an
rock
not
bullet
hit
um
head
he
explained
make
skull
almost
break
bend
um
in
but
nepapinas
straighten
again
with
fingers
he
shrugged
his
thin
shoulders
with
a
cackling
laugh
of
pride
as
he
worked
his
fingers
to
show
how
the
operation
had
been
done
david
shook
hands
with
him
in
silence
then
nepapinas
put
on
the
fresh
bandage
and
after
that
went
out
chuckling
again
in
his
weird
way
as
though
he
had
played
a
great
joke
on
the
white
man
whom
his
wizardry
had
snatched
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
for
some
time
there
had
been
a
subdued
activity
outside
the
singing
of
the
boatmen
had
ceased
a
low
voice
was
giving
commands
and
looking
through
the
window
david
saw
that
the
bateau
was
slowly
swinging
away
from
the
shore
he
turned
from
the
window
to
the
table
and
lighted
the
cigar
pierre
wife
had
given
him
in
spite
of
the
mental
struggle
he
had
made
during
the
presence
of
nepapinas
he
had
failed
to
get
a
grip
on
himself
for
a
time
he
had
ceased
to
be
david
carrigan
the
a
few
days
ago
his
blood
had
run
to
that
almost
savage
thrill
of
the
great
game
of
one
against
one
the
game
in
which
law
sat
on
one
side
of
the
board
and
lawlessness
on
the
other
with
the
cards
between
it
was
the
great
gamble
the
cards
meant
life
or
death
there
was
never
a
checkmate
one
or
the
other
had
to
lose
had
some
one
told
him
then
that
soon
he
would
meet
the
broken
and
twisted
hulk
of
a
man
who
had
known
black
roger
audemard
every
nerve
in
him
would
have
thrilled
in
anticipation
of
that
hour
he
realized
this
as
he
paced
back
and
forth
over
the
thick
rugs
of
the
bateau
floor
and
he
knew
even
as
he
struggled
to
bring
them
back
that
the
old
thrill
and
the
old
desire
were
gone
it
was
impossible
to
lie
to
himself
pierre
in
this
moment
was
of
more
importance
to
him
than
roger
audemard
and
pierre
wife
his
eyes
fell
on
the
crumpled
handkerchief
on
the
piano
keys
again
he
was
crushing
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
again
the
flood
of
humiliation
and
shame
swept
over
him
he
dropped
the
handkerchief
and
the
great
law
of
his
own
life
seemed
to
rise
up
in
his
face
and
taunt
him
he
was
clean
that
had
been
his
greatest
pride
he
hated
the
man
who
was
unclean
it
was
his
instinct
to
kill
the
man
who
desecrated
another
man
home
and
here
in
the
sacredness
of
paradise
he
found
himself
at
last
face
to
face
with
that
greatest
fight
of
all
the
ages
he
faced
the
door
he
threw
back
his
shoulders
until
they
snapped
and
he
laughed
as
if
at
the
thing
that
had
risen
up
to
point
its
finger
at
him
after
all
it
did
not
hurt
a
man
to
go
through
a
bit
of
fire
if
he
came
out
of
it
unburned
and
deep
in
his
heart
he
knew
it
was
not
a
sin
to
love
even
as
he
loved
if
he
kept
that
love
to
himself
what
he
had
done
when
stood
at
the
window
he
could
not
undo
pierre
would
probably
have
killed
him
for
touching
her
hair
with
his
lips
and
he
would
not
have
blamed
pierre
but
she
had
not
felt
that
stolen
caress
no
one
knew
but
himself
and
he
was
happier
because
of
it
it
was
a
sort
of
sacred
thing
even
though
it
brought
the
heat
of
shame
into
his
face
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
out
in
the
sunshine
it
was
good
to
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sun
in
his
face
again
and
the
sweet
air
of
the
open
day
in
his
lungs
the
bateau
was
free
of
the
shore
and
drifting
steadily
towards
midstream
bateese
was
at
the
great
birchwood
rudder
sweep
and
to
david
surprise
he
nodded
in
a
friendly
way
and
his
wide
mouth
broke
into
a
grin
ah
it
is
coming
soon
that
fight
of
ours
little
coq
de
bruyere
he
chuckled
gloatingly
an
ze
fight
will
be
jus
lak
that
you
ze
little
rooster
ze
partridge
an
i
concombre
bateese
ze
eagle
the
anticipation
in
the
eyes
reflected
itself
for
an
instant
in
david
he
turned
back
into
the
cabin
bent
over
his
pack
and
found
among
his
clothes
two
pairs
of
boxing
gloves
he
fondled
them
with
the
loving
touch
of
a
brother
and
comrade
and
their
velvety
smoothness
was
more
soothing
to
his
nerves
than
the
cigar
he
was
smoking
his
one
passion
above
all
others
was
boxing
and
wherever
he
went
either
on
pleasure
or
adventure
the
gloves
went
with
him
in
many
a
cabin
and
shack
of
the
far
hinterland
he
had
taught
white
men
and
indians
how
to
use
them
so
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
feeling
the
thrill
of
them
on
his
hands
and
now
here
was
concombre
bateese
inviting
him
on
waiting
for
him
to
get
well
he
went
out
and
dangled
the
mittens
under
the
nose
bateese
looked
at
them
curiously
mitaines
he
nodded

little
partridge

his
claws

ze
winter
they
are
clumsy
i
can
make

up
his
fist

asked
well

that

are
not
mittens
to
keep
your
hands
warm
i
am
going
to
fight
you
in
them
when
our
time
comes
with
these
mittens
i
will
fight
you
and
your
naked
fists
why
because
i
do
not
want
to
hurt
you
too
badly
friend
bateese
i
do
not
want
to
break
your
face
all
to
pieces
which
i
would
surely
do
if
i
did
not
put
on
these
soft
mittens
then
when
you
have
really
learned
to
fight
the
bull
neck
of
concombre
bateese
looked
as
if
it
were
about
to
burst
his
eyes
seemed
ready
to
pop
out
of
their
sockets
and
suddenly
he
let
out
a
roar
what
you
dare
talk
lak
that
to
concombre
bateese
is
fightin
man
on
all
river
you
talk
lak
that
to
me
concombre
bateese
who
will
kill
ze
bear
wit
hees
ban
who
pull
down
ze
tree
who
who
the
of
his
outraged
dignity
sprang
to
his
lips
emotion
choked
him
and
then
looking
suddenly
over
carrigan
shoulder
he
stopped
something
in
his
look
made
david
turn
three
paces
behind
him
stood
and
he
knew
that
from
the
corner
of
the
cabin
she
had
heard
what
had
passed
between
them
she
was
biting
her
lips
and
behind
the
flash
of
her
eyes
he
saw
laughter
you
must
not
quarrel
children
she
said
bateese
you
are
steering
badly
she
reached
out
her
hands
and
without
a
word
david
gave
her
the
gloves
with
her
palm
and
fingers
she
caressed
them
softly
yet
david
saw
little
lines
of
doubt
come
into
her
white
forehead
they
are
pretty
and
soft
david
surely
they
can
not
hurt
much
some
day
when
pierre
comes
will
you
teach
me
how
to
use
them
always
it
is
pierre
comes
he
replied
shall
we
be
waiting
long
two
or
three
days
perhaps
a
little
longer
are
you
coming
with
me
to
the
proue
she
did
not
wait
for
his
answer
but
went
ahead
of
him
dangling
the
two
pairs
of
gloves
at
her
side
david
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
the
face
as
he
followed
around
the
end
of
the
cabin
bateese
was
making
a
frightful
grimace
and
shaking
his
huge
fist
but
scarcely
were
they
out
of
sight
on
the
narrow
footway
that
ran
between
the
cabin
and
the
outer
timbers
of
the
scow
when
a
huge
roar
of
laughter
followed
them
bateese
had
not
done
laughing
when
they
reached
the
proue
or
a
deck
fully
ten
feet
in
length
by
eight
in
width
sheltered
above
by
an
awning
and
comfortably
arranged
with
chairs
several
rugs
a
small
table
and
to
david
amazement
a
hammock
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
on
the
three
rivers
nor
had
he
ever
heard
of
a
scow
so
large
or
so
luxuriously
appointed
over
his
head
at
the
tip
of
a
flagstaff
attached
to
the
forward
end
of
the
cabin
floated
the
black
and
white
pennant
of
pierre
boulain
and
under
this
staff
was
a
screened
door
which
undoubtedly
opened
into
the
kitchenette
which
had
told
him
about
he
made
no
effort
to
hide
his
surprise
but
pierre
wife
seemed
not
to
notice
it
the
puckery
little
lines
were
still
in
her
forehead
and
the
laughter
had
faded
out
of
her
eyes
the
tiny
lines
deepened
as
there
came
another
wild
roar
of
laughter
from
bateese
in
the
stern
is
it
true
that
you
have
given
your
word
to
fight
bateese
she
asked
it
is
true
and
i
feel
that
bateese
is
looking
ahead
joyously
to
the
occasion
he
is
she
affirmed
last
night
he
spread
the
news
among
all
my
people
those
who
left
to
join
pierre
this
morning
have
taken
the
news
with
them
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
much
betting
i
am
afraid
you
have
made
a
bad
promise
no
man
has
offered
to
fight
bateese
in
three
years
not
even
my
great
pierre
who
says
that
concombre
is
more
than
a
match
for
him
and
yet
they
must
have
a
little
doubt
as
there
is
betting
and
it
takes
two
to
make
a
bet
chuckled
david
the
lines
went
out
of
forehead
and
a
trembled
on
her
red
lips
yes
there
is
betting
but
those
who
are
for
you
are
offering
next
autumn
muskrat
skins
and
frozen
fish
against
lynx
and
fisher
and
marten
the
odds
are
about
thirty
to
one
against
you
david
the
look
of
pity
which
was
clearly
in
her
eyes
brought
a
rush
of
blood
to
david
face
if
only
i
had
something
to
wager
he
groaned
you
must
not
fight
i
shall
forbid
it
then
bateese
and
i
will
steal
off
into
the
forest
and
have
it
out
by
ourselves
he
will
hurt
you
badly
he
is
terrible
like
a
great
beast
when
he
fights
he
loves
to
fight
and
is
always
asking
if
there
is
not
some
one
who
will
stand
up
to
him
i
think
he
would
desert
even
me
for
a
good
fight
but
you
david
i
also
love
a
fight
he
admitted
unashamed
pierre
wife
studied
him
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
with
these
she
asked
then
holding
up
the
gloves
yes
with
those
bateese
may
use
his
fists
but
i
shall
use
those
so
that
i
shall
not
disfigure
him
permanently
his
face
is
none
too
handsome
as
it
is
for
another
flash
her
lips
trembled
on
the
edge
of
a
smile
then
she
gave
him
the
gloves
a
bit
troubled
and
nodded
to
a
chair
with
a
deep
cushioned
seat
and
wide
arms
please
make
yourself
comfortable
david
i
have
something
to
do
in
the
cabin
and
will
return
in
a
little
while
he
wondered
if
she
had
gone
back
to
settle
the
matter
with
bateese
at
once
for
it
was
clear
that
she
did
not
regard
with
favor
the
promised
bout
between
himself
and
the
it
was
on
the
spur
of
a
careless
moment
that
he
had
promised
to
fight
bateese
and
with
little
thought
that
it
was
likely
to
be
carried
out
or
that
it
would
become
a
matter
of
importance
with
all
of
pierre
brigade
he
was
evidently
in
for
it
he
told
himself
and
as
a
fighting
man
it
looked
as
though
concombre
bateese
was
at
least
the
equal
of
his
braggadocio
he
was
glad
of
that
he
grinned
as
he
watched
the
bending
backs
of
pierre
men
so
they
were
betting
thirty
to
one
against
him
even
pierre
might
be
induced
to
bet
with
him
and
if
he
did
the
hot
blood
leaped
for
a
moment
in
carrigan
veins
the
thrill
went
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
stared
out
over
the
river
unseeing
as
the
possibilities
of
the
thing
that
had
come
into
his
mind
made
him
for
a
moment
oblivious
of
the
world
he
possessed
one
thing
against
which
pierre
and
pierre
wife
would
wager
a
half
of
all
they
owned
in
the
world
and
if
he
should
gamble
that
one
thing
which
had
come
to
him
like
an
inspiration
and
should
whip
bateese
he
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
over
the
narrow
deck
no
longer
watching
the
rowers
or
the
shore
the
thought
grew
and
his
mind
was
consumed
by
it
thus
far
from
the
moment
the
first
shot
was
fired
at
him
from
the
ambush
he
had
been
playing
with
adventure
in
the
dark
but
fate
had
at
last
dealt
him
a
trump
card
that
something
which
he
possessed
was
more
precious
than
furs
or
gold
to
pierre
and
pierre
would
not
refuse
the
wager
when
it
was
offered
he
would
not
dare
refuse
more
than
that
he
would
accept
eagerly
strong
in
the
faith
that
bateese
would
whip
him
as
he
had
whipped
all
other
fighters
who
had
come
up
against
him
along
the
three
rivers
and
when
knew
what
that
wager
was
to
be
she
too
would
pray
for
the
gods
of
chance
to
be
with
concombre
bateese
he
did
not
hear
the
light
footsteps
behind
him
and
when
he
turned
suddenly
in
his
pacing
he
found
himself
facing
who
carried
in
her
hands
the
little
basket
he
had
seen
on
the
cabin
table
she
seated
herself
in
the
hammock
and
took
from
the
basket
a
bit
of
lace
work
for
a
moment
he
watched
her
fingers
flashing
in
and
out
with
the
needles
perhaps
his
thought
went
to
her
he
was
almost
frightened
as
he
saw
her
cheeks
coloring
under
the
long
dark
lashes
he
faced
the
rivermen
again
and
while
he
gripped
at
his
own
weakness
he
tried
to
count
the
flashings
of
their
oars
and
behind
him
the
beautiful
eyes
of
pierre
wife
were
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
glow
in
their
depths
do
you
know
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
still
looking
toward
the
flashing
of
the
oars
something
tells
me
that
unexpected
things
are
going
to
happen
when
pierre
returns
i
am
going
to
make
a
bet
with
him
that
i
can
whip
bateese
he
will
not
refuse
he
will
accept
and
pierre
will
lose
because
i
shall
whip
bateese
it
is
then
that
these
unexpected
things
will
begin
to
happen
and
i
am
wondering
after
they
do
happen
if
you
will
care
so
very
much
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
i
do
want
you
to
fight
bateese
she
said
the
needles
were
working
swiftly
when
he
turned
toward
her
again
and
a
second
time
the
long
lashes
shadowed
what
a
moment
before
he
might
have
seen
in
her
eyes
xiii
the
morning
passed
like
a
dream
to
carrigan
he
permitted
himself
to
live
and
breathe
it
as
one
who
finds
himself
for
a
space
in
the
heart
of
a
golden
mirage
he
was
sitting
so
near
that
now
and
then
the
faint
perfume
of
her
came
to
him
like
the
delicate
scent
of
a
flower
it
was
a
breath
of
crushed
violets
sweet
as
the
air
he
was
breathing
violets
gathered
in
the
deep
cool
of
the
forest
a
whisper
of
sweetness
about
her
as
if
on
her
bosom
she
wore
always
the
living
flowers
he
fancied
her
gathering
them
last
a
year
ago
alone
her
feet
seeking
out
the
damp
mosses
her
little
fingers
plucking
the
smiling
and
laughing
faces
of
the
violet
flowers
to
be
treasured
away
in
fragrant
sachets
as
gentle
as
the
note
compared
with
the
bottled
aromas
fifteen
hundred
miles
south
it
seemed
to
be
a
physical
part
of
her
a
thing
born
of
the
glow
in
her
cheeks
a
living
exhalation
of
her
soft
red
lips
and
yet
only
when
he
was
near
very
near
did
the
life
of
it
reach
him
she
did
not
know
he
was
thinking
these
things
there
was
nothing
in
his
voice
he
thought
to
betray
him
he
was
sure
she
was
unconscious
of
the
fight
he
was
making
her
eyes
smiled
and
laughed
with
him
she
counted
her
stitches
her
fingers
worked
and
she
talked
to
him
as
she
might
have
talked
to
a
friend
of
pierre
she
told
him
how
pierre
had
made
the
barge
the
largest
that
had
ever
been
on
the
river
and
that
he
had
built
it
entirely
of
dry
cedar
so
that
it
floated
like
a
feather
wherever
there
was
water
enough
to
run
a
york
boat
she
told
him
how
pierre
had
brought
the
piano
down
from
edmonton
and
how
he
had
saved
it
from
pitching
in
the
river
by
carrying
the
full
weight
of
it
on
his
shoulders
when
they
met
with
an
accident
in
running
through
a
dangerous
rapids
bringing
it
down
pierre
was
a
very
strong
man
she
said
a
note
of
pride
in
her
voice
and
then
she
added
sometimes
when
he
picks
me
up
in
his
arms
i
feel
that
he
is
going
to
squeeze
the
life
out
of
me
her
words
were
like
a
sharp
thrust
into
his
heart
for
an
instant
they
painted
a
vision
for
him
a
picture
of
that
slim
and
adorable
creature
crushed
close
in
the
great
arms
of
pierre
so
close
that
she
could
not
breathe
in
that
mad
moment
of
his
hurt
it
was
almost
a
living
breathing
reality
for
him
there
on
the
golden
of
the
scow
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
far
shore
where
the
wilderness
seemed
to
reach
off
into
eternity
what
a
glory
it
was
the
green
seas
of
spruce
and
cedar
and
balsam
the
ridges
of
poplar
and
birch
rising
like
silvery
spume
above
the
darker
billows
and
afar
off
mellowed
in
the
the
guardian
crests
of
trout
mountains
sentineling
the
country
beyond
into
that
on
the
farther
side
of
the
wabiskaw
waterways
carrigan
would
have
loved
to
set
his
foot
four
days
ago
it
was
that
mystery
of
the
unpeopled
places
that
he
most
desired
their
silence
the
comradeship
of
spaces
untrod
by
the
feet
of
man
and
now
what
a
fool
he
was
through
vast
distances
the
forests
he
loved
seemed
to
whisper
it
to
him
and
ahead
of
him
the
river
seemed
to
look
back
nodding
over
its
shoulder
beckoning
to
him
telling
him
the
word
of
the
forests
was
true
it
streamed
on
lazily
half
a
mile
wide
as
if
resting
for
the
splashing
and
roaring
rush
it
would
make
among
the
rocks
of
the
next
rapids
and
in
its
indolence
it
sang
the
low
and
everlasting
song
of
deep
and
slowly
passing
water
in
that
song
david
heard
the
same
whisper
that
he
was
a
fool
and
the
lure
of
the
wilderness
shores
crept
in
on
him
and
gripped
him
as
of
old
he
looked
at
the
rowers
in
the
two
york
boats
and
then
his
eyes
came
back
to
the
end
of
the
barge
and
to
pierre
wife
her
little
toes
were
tapping
the
floor
of
the
deck
she
too
was
looking
out
over
the
wilderness
and
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
like
a
bird
that
wanted
to
fly
i
should
like
to
go
into
those
hills
she
said
without
looking
at
him
away
off
yonder
and
i
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
you
love
all
that
she
asked
yes
madame
why
when
i
have
given
you
permission
to
call
me
she
demanded
because
you
call
me
but
you
you
have
not
given
me
permission
then
i
do
now
he
interrupted
quickly
merci
i
have
wondered
why
you
did
not
return
the
courtesy
she
laughed
softly
i
do
not
like
the
i
shall
call
you
she
rose
out
of
the
hammock
suddenly
and
dropped
her
needles
and
lace
work
into
the
little
basket
i
have
forgotten
something
it
is
for
you
to
eat
when
it
comes
i
mean
david
so
i
must
turn
fille
de
cuisine
for
a
little
while
that
is
what
pierre
sometimes
calls
me
because
i
love
to
play
at
cooking
i
am
going
to
bake
a
pie
the
door
of
the
kitchenette
closed
behind
her
and
carrigan
walked
out
from
under
the
awning
so
that
the
sun
beat
down
upon
him
there
was
no
longer
a
doubt
in
his
mind
he
was
more
than
fool
he
envied
pierre
and
he
coveted
that
which
pierre
possessed
and
yet
before
he
would
take
what
did
not
belong
to
him
he
knew
he
would
put
a
pistol
to
his
head
and
blow
his
life
out
he
was
confident
of
himself
there
yet
he
had
fallen
and
out
of
the
mire
into
which
he
had
sunk
he
knew
also
that
he
must
drag
himself
and
quickly
or
be
everlastingly
lowered
in
his
own
esteem
he
stripped
himself
naked
and
did
not
lie
to
that
other
and
greater
thing
of
life
that
was
in
him
he
was
not
only
a
fool
but
a
coward
only
a
coward
would
have
touched
the
hair
of
pierre
wife
with
his
lips
only
a
coward
would
have
let
live
the
thoughts
that
burned
in
his
brain
she
was
wife
and
he
was
anxious
now
for
the
quick
homecoming
of
the
chief
of
the
boulains
after
that
everything
would
happen
quickly
he
thanked
god
that
the
inspiration
of
the
wager
had
come
to
him
after
the
fight
after
he
had
won
then
once
more
would
he
be
the
old
dave
carrigan
holding
the
trump
hand
in
a
thrilling
game
loud
voices
from
the
york
boats
ahead
and
answering
cries
from
bateese
in
the
stern
drew
him
to
the
open
deck
the
bateau
was
close
to
shore
and
the
was
working
the
long
stern
sweep
as
if
the
power
of
a
was
in
his
mighty
arms
the
york
boats
had
shortened
their
towline
and
were
pulling
at
right
angles
within
a
few
yards
of
a
gravelly
beach
a
few
strokes
more
and
men
who
were
bare
to
the
knees
jumped
out
into
shallow
water
and
began
tugging
at
the
tow
rope
with
their
hands
david
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
never
in
his
life
had
time
passed
so
swiftly
as
that
morning
on
the
forward
deck
of
the
barge
and
now
they
were
tying
up
after
a
drop
of
six
or
eight
miles
down
the
river
and
he
wondered
how
swiftly
pierre
was
overtaking
them
with
his
raft
he
was
filled
with
the
desire
to
feel
the
soft
crush
of
the
earth
under
his
feet
again
and
not
waiting
for
the
long
plank
that
bateese
was
already
swinging
from
the
scow
to
the
shore
he
made
a
leap
that
put
him
on
the
sandy
beach
pierre
wife
had
given
him
this
permission
and
he
looked
to
see
what
effect
his
act
had
on
the
the
face
of
concombre
bateese
was
like
sullen
stone
not
a
sound
came
from
his
thick
lips
but
in
his
eyes
was
a
deep
and
dangerous
fire
as
he
looked
at
carrigan
there
was
no
need
for
words
in
them
were
suspicion
warning
the
deadly
threat
of
what
would
happen
if
he
did
not
come
back
when
it
was
time
to
return
david
nodded
he
understood
even
though
pierre
wife
had
faith
in
him
bateese
had
not
he
passed
between
the
men
and
to
a
man
their
faces
turned
on
him
and
in
their
quiet
and
watchful
eyes
he
saw
again
that
warning
and
suspicion
the
unspoken
threat
of
what
would
happen
if
he
forgot
his
promise
to
boulain
never
in
a
single
outfit
had
he
seen
such
splendid
men
they
were
not
a
mongrel
assortment
of
the
lower
country
slim
tall
sinewy
they
were
stock
of
the
old
voyageurs
of
a
hundred
years
ago
and
all
of
them
were
young
the
older
men
had
gone
to
pierre
the
reason
for
this
dawned
upon
carrigan
not
one
of
these
twelve
but
could
beat
him
in
a
race
through
the
forest
not
one
that
could
not
outrun
him
and
cut
him
off
though
he
had
hours
the
start
passing
beyond
them
he
paused
and
looked
back
at
the
bateau
on
the
forward
deck
stood
and
she
too
was
looking
at
him
now
even
at
that
distance
he
saw
that
her
face
was
quiet
and
troubled
with
anxiety
she
did
not
smile
when
he
lifted
his
hat
to
her
but
gave
only
a
little
nod
then
he
turned
and
buried
himself
in
the
green
balsams
that
grew
within
fifty
paces
of
the
river
the
old
joy
of
life
leaped
into
him
as
his
feet
crushed
in
the
soft
moss
of
the
shaded
places
where
the
sun
did
not
break
through
he
went
on
passing
through
a
vast
and
silent
cathedral
of
spruce
and
cedar
so
dense
that
the
sky
was
hidden
and
came
then
to
higher
ground
where
the
evergreen
was
sprinkled
with
birch
and
poplar
about
him
was
an
invisible
choir
of
voices
the
low
twittering
of
timid
little
the
song
of
hidden
warblers
the
scolding
of
distant
jays
stared
at
him
as
he
passed
fluttering
so
close
to
his
face
that
they
almost
touched
his
shoulders
in
their
foolish
inquisitiveness
a
porcupine
crashed
within
a
dozen
feet
of
his
trail
and
then
he
came
to
a
beaten
path
and
other
paths
worn
deep
in
the
cool
damp
earth
by
the
hoofs
of
moose
and
caribou
half
a
mile
from
the
bateau
he
sat
down
on
a
rotting
log
and
filled
his
pipe
with
fresh
tobacco
while
he
listened
to
catch
the
subdued
voice
of
the
life
in
this
land
that
he
loved
it
was
then
that
the
curious
feeling
came
over
him
that
he
was
not
alone
that
other
eyes
than
those
of
beast
and
bird
were
watching
him
it
was
an
impression
that
grew
on
him
he
seemed
to
feel
their
stare
seeking
him
out
from
the
darkest
coverts
waiting
for
him
to
shove
on
dogging
him
like
a
ghost
within
him
the
instincts
of
the
rose
swiftly
to
the
suspicion
of
invisible
presence
he
began
to
note
the
changes
in
the
cries
of
certain
birds
a
hundred
yards
on
his
right
a
jay
most
talkative
of
all
the
forest
things
was
screeching
with
a
new
note
in
its
voice
on
the
other
side
of
him
in
a
dense
pocket
of
poplar
and
spruce
a
warbler
suddenly
brought
its
song
to
a
jerky
end
he
heard
the
excited
of
a
startled
little
giving
warning
of
an
unwelcome
intruder
near
its
nest
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
laughing
softly
as
he
thumbed
down
the
tobacco
in
his
pipe
jeanne
boulain
might
believe
in
him
but
bateese
and
her
wary
henchmen
had
ways
of
their
own
of
strengthening
their
faith
it
was
close
to
noon
when
he
turned
back
and
he
did
not
return
by
the
moose
path
deliberately
he
struck
out
a
hundred
yards
on
either
side
of
it
traveling
where
the
moss
grew
thick
and
the
earth
was
damp
and
soft
and
five
times
he
found
the
of
men
bateese
with
his
sleeves
up
was
scrubbing
the
deck
of
the
bateau
when
david
came
over
the
plank
there
are
moose
and
caribou
in
there
but
i
fear
i
disturbed
your
hunters
said
carrigan
grinning
at
the
they
are
too
clumsy
to
hunt
well
so
clumsy
that
even
the
birds
give
them
away
i
am
afraid
we
shall
go
without
fresh
meat
tomorrow
concombre
bateese
stared
as
if
some
one
had
stunned
him
with
a
blow
and
he
spoke
no
word
as
david
went
on
to
the
forward
deck
had
come
out
under
the
awning
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
relief
and
pleasure
i
am
glad
you
have
come
back
david
so
am
i
madame
he
replied
i
think
the
woods
are
unhealthful
to
travel
in
out
of
the
earth
he
felt
that
a
part
of
the
old
strength
had
returned
to
him
alone
they
sat
at
dinner
and
waited
on
him
and
called
him
david
again
and
he
found
it
easier
now
to
call
her
and
look
into
her
eyes
without
fear
that
he
was
betraying
himself
a
part
of
the
afternoon
he
spent
in
her
company
and
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
tell
her
something
of
his
adventuring
in
the
north
and
how
body
and
soul
the
northland
had
claimed
him
and
that
he
hoped
to
die
in
it
when
his
time
came
her
eyes
glowed
at
that
she
told
him
of
two
years
she
had
spent
in
montreal
and
quebec
of
her
homesickness
her
joy
when
she
returned
to
her
forests
it
seemed
for
a
time
that
they
had
forgotten
pierre
they
did
not
speak
of
him
twice
they
saw
andre
the
broken
man
but
the
name
of
roger
audemard
was
not
spoken
and
a
little
at
a
time
she
told
him
of
the
hidden
paradise
of
the
boulains
away
up
in
the
unmapped
wildernesses
of
the
yellowknife
beyond
the
great
bear
and
of
the
great
log
chateau
that
was
her
home
a
part
of
the
afternoon
he
spent
on
shore
he
filled
a
moosehide
bag
full
of
sand
and
suspended
it
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
and
for
of
an
hour
pommeled
it
with
his
fists
much
to
the
curiosity
and
amusement
of
pierre
men
who
could
see
nothing
of
in
these
antics
but
the
exercise
assured
david
that
he
had
lost
but
little
of
his
strength
and
that
he
would
be
in
form
to
meet
bateese
when
the
time
came
toward
evening
joined
him
and
they
walked
for
half
an
hour
up
and
down
the
beach
it
was
bateese
who
got
supper
and
after
that
carrigan
sat
with
on
the
foredeck
of
the
barge
and
smoked
another
of
pierre
cigars
the
camp
of
the
rivermen
was
two
hundred
yards
below
the
bateau
screened
between
by
a
finger
of
hardwood
so
that
except
when
they
broke
into
a
chorus
of
laughter
or
strengthened
their
throats
with
snatches
of
song
there
was
no
sound
of
their
voices
but
bateese
was
in
the
stern
and
nepapinas
was
forever
flitting
in
and
out
among
the
shadows
on
the
shore
like
a
shadow
himself
and
andre
the
broken
man
hovered
near
as
night
came
on
at
last
he
sat
down
in
the
edge
of
the
white
sand
of
the
beach
and
there
he
remained
a
silent
and
lonely
figure
as
the
twilight
deepened
over
the
world
hovered
a
sleepy
quiet
out
of
the
forest
came
the
droning
of
the
the
last
twitterings
of
the
day
birds
and
the
beginning
of
night
sounds
a
great
shadow
floated
out
over
the
river
close
to
the
bateau
the
first
of
the
questing
owls
adventuring
out
like
pirates
from
their
of
the
day
one
after
another
as
the
darkness
thickened
the
different
tribes
of
the
people
of
the
night
answered
the
summons
of
the
first
stars
a
mile
down
the
river
a
loon
gave
its
harsh
far
out
of
the
west
came
the
faint
of
a
wolf
in
the
river
the
trout
splashed
like
the
tails
of
beaver
over
the
roof
of
the
wilderness
came
the
coughing
moaning
challenge
of
a
bull
moose
that
yearned
for
battle
and
over
these
same
forest
tops
rose
the
moon
the
stars
grew
thicker
and
brighter
and
through
the
finger
of
hardwood
glowed
the
fire
of
pierre
boulain
men
while
close
beside
him
silent
in
these
hours
of
silence
david
felt
growing
nearer
and
still
nearer
to
him
the
presence
of
pierre
wife
on
the
strip
of
sand
andre
the
broken
man
rose
and
stood
like
the
stub
of
a
misshapen
tree
and
then
slowly
he
moved
on
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
mellow
glow
of
the
night
it
is
at
night
that
he
seeks
said
pierre
wife
for
it
was
as
if
david
had
spoken
the
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
david
for
a
moment
was
silent
and
then
he
said
you
asked
me
to
tell
you
about
black
roger
audemard
i
will
if
you
care
to
have
me
do
you
he
saw
the
nodding
of
her
head
though
the
moon
and
veiled
her
face
yes
what
do
the
police
say
about
roger
audemard
he
told
her
and
not
once
in
the
telling
of
the
story
did
she
speak
or
move
it
was
a
terrible
story
at
best
he
thought
but
he
did
not
weaken
it
by
smoothing
over
the
details
this
was
his
opportunity
he
wanted
her
to
know
why
he
must
possess
the
body
of
roger
audemard
if
not
alive
then
dead
and
he
wanted
her
to
understand
how
important
it
was
that
he
learn
more
about
andre
the
broken
man
he
was
a
fiend
this
roger
audemard
he
began
a
devil
in
man
shape
afterward
called
roger
because
of
the
color
of
his
soul
then
he
went
on
he
described
hatchet
river
post
where
the
tragedy
had
happened
then
told
of
the
fight
that
came
about
one
day
between
roger
audemard
and
the
factor
of
the
post
and
his
two
sons
it
was
an
unfair
fight
he
conceded
that
three
to
one
was
cowardly
in
a
fight
but
it
could
not
excuse
what
happened
afterward
audemard
was
beaten
he
crept
off
into
the
forest
almost
dead
then
he
came
back
one
stormy
night
in
the
winter
with
three
strange
friends
who
the
friends
were
the
police
never
learned
there
was
a
fight
but
all
through
the
fight
black
roger
audemard
cried
out
not
to
kill
the
factor
and
his
sons
in
spite
of
that
one
of
the
sons
was
killed
then
the
terrible
thing
happened
the
father
and
his
remaining
son
were
bound
hand
and
foot
and
fastened
in
the
ancient
dungeon
room
under
the
post
building
then
black
roger
set
the
building
on
fire
and
stood
outside
in
the
storm
and
laughed
like
a
madman
at
the
dying
shrieks
of
his
victims
it
was
the
season
when
the
trappers
were
on
their
lines
and
there
were
but
few
people
at
the
post
the
company
clerk
and
one
other
attempted
to
interfere
and
black
roger
killed
them
with
his
own
hands
five
deaths
that
night
two
of
them
horrible
beyond
description
resting
for
a
moment
carrigan
went
on
to
tell
of
the
long
years
of
unavailing
search
made
by
the
police
after
that
how
black
roger
was
caught
once
and
killed
his
captor
then
came
the
rumor
that
he
was
dead
and
rumor
grew
into
official
belief
and
the
police
no
longer
hunted
for
his
trails
then
not
long
ago
came
the
discovery
that
black
roger
was
still
living
and
he
dave
carrigan
was
after
him
for
a
time
there
was
silence
after
he
had
finished
then
wife
rose
to
her
feet
i
wonder
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
roger
audemard
own
story
might
be
if
he
were
here
to
tell
it
she
stepped
out
from
under
the
awning
and
in
the
full
radiance
of
the
moon
he
saw
the
pale
beauty
of
her
face
and
the
crowning
luster
of
her
hair
good
night
she
whispered
good
night
said
david
he
listened
until
her
retreating
footsteps
died
away
and
for
hours
after
that
he
had
no
thought
of
sleep
he
had
insisted
that
she
take
possession
of
her
cabin
again
and
bateese
had
brought
out
a
bundle
of
blankets
these
he
spread
under
the
awning
and
when
he
drowsed
off
it
was
to
dream
of
the
lovely
face
he
had
seen
last
in
the
glow
of
the
moon
it
was
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
that
two
things
happened
one
that
he
had
prepared
himself
for
and
another
so
unexpected
that
for
a
space
it
sent
his
world
crashing
out
of
its
orbit
with
wife
he
had
gone
again
to
the
for
flowers
half
a
mile
back
from
the
river
returning
a
new
way
they
came
to
a
shallow
stream
and
stood
at
the
edge
of
it
and
there
was
laughter
in
her
shining
eyes
as
she
looked
to
the
other
side
of
it
she
had
twined
flowers
into
her
hair
her
cheeks
were
rich
with
color
her
slim
figure
was
exquisite
in
its
wild
pulse
of
life
suddenly
she
turned
on
him
her
red
lips
smiling
their
witchery
in
his
face
you
must
carry
me
across
she
said
he
did
not
answer
he
was
as
he
drew
near
her
she
raised
her
arms
a
little
waiting
and
then
he
picked
her
up
she
was
against
his
breast
her
two
hands
went
to
his
shoulders
as
he
waded
into
the
stream
he
slipped
and
they
clung
a
little
tighter
the
soft
note
of
laughter
was
in
her
throat
when
the
current
came
to
his
knees
out
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
he
held
her
tighter
and
then
stupidly
he
slipped
again
and
the
movement
brought
her
lower
in
his
arms
so
that
for
a
space
her
head
was
against
his
breast
and
his
face
was
crushed
in
the
soft
masses
of
her
hair
he
came
with
her
that
way
to
the
opposite
shore
and
stood
her
on
her
feet
again
standing
back
quickly
so
that
she
would
not
hear
the
pounding
of
his
heart
her
face
was
radiantly
beautiful
and
she
did
not
look
at
david
but
away
from
him
thank
you
she
said
and
then
suddenly
they
heard
running
feet
behind
them
and
in
another
moment
one
of
the
brigade
men
came
dashing
through
the
stream
at
the
same
time
there
came
from
the
river
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
a
thunderous
burst
of
voice
it
was
not
the
voice
of
a
dozen
men
but
of
half
a
hundred
and
grew
tense
listening
her
eyes
on
fire
even
before
the
messenger
could
get
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
it
is
st
pierre
he
cried
then
he
has
come
with
the
great
raft
and
you
must
hurry
if
you
would
reach
the
bateau
before
he
lands
in
that
moment
it
seemed
to
david
that
forgot
he
was
alive
a
little
cry
came
to
her
lips
and
then
she
left
him
running
swiftly
saying
no
word
to
him
flying
with
the
speed
of
a
fawn
to
pierre
boulain
and
when
david
turned
to
the
man
who
had
come
up
behind
them
there
was
a
strange
smile
on
the
lips
of
the
as
his
eyes
followed
the
hurrying
figure
of
pierre
wife
until
she
was
out
of
sight
he
stood
in
silence
and
then
he
said
come
we
also
must
meet
st
pierre
xiv
david
moved
slowly
behind
the
brigade
man
he
had
no
desire
to
hurry
he
did
not
wish
to
see
what
happened
when
met
pierre
boulain
only
a
moment
ago
she
had
been
in
his
arms
her
hair
had
smothered
his
face
her
hands
had
clung
to
his
shoulders
her
flushed
cheeks
and
long
lashes
had
for
an
instant
lain
close
against
his
breast
and
now
swiftly
without
a
word
of
apology
she
was
running
away
from
him
to
meet
her
husband
he
almost
spoke
that
word
aloud
as
he
saw
the
last
of
her
slim
figure
among
the
silver
birches
she
was
going
to
the
man
to
whom
she
belonged
and
there
was
no
hesitation
in
the
manner
of
her
going
she
was
glad
and
she
was
entirely
forgetful
of
him
dave
carrigan
in
that
gladness
he
quickened
his
steps
narrowing
the
distance
between
him
and
the
hurrying
brigade
man
only
the
diseased
thoughts
in
his
brain
had
made
the
happening
in
the
creek
anything
but
an
accident
it
was
all
an
accident
he
told
himself
had
asked
him
to
carry
her
across
just
as
she
would
have
asked
any
one
of
her
rivermen
it
was
his
fault
and
not
hers
that
he
had
slipped
in
and
that
his
arms
had
closed
tighter
about
her
and
that
her
hair
had
brushed
his
face
he
remembered
she
had
laughed
when
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
they
were
going
to
fall
into
the
stream
together
probably
she
would
tell
pierre
all
about
it
surely
she
would
never
guess
it
had
been
nearer
tragedy
than
comedy
for
him
once
more
he
was
convinced
he
had
proved
himself
a
weakling
and
a
fool
his
business
now
was
with
pierre
and
the
hour
was
at
hand
when
the
game
had
ceased
to
be
a
woman
game
he
had
looked
ahead
to
this
hour
he
had
prepared
himself
for
it
and
had
promised
himself
action
that
would
be
both
quick
and
decisive
and
yet
as
he
went
on
his
heart
was
still
thumping
unsteadily
and
in
his
arms
and
against
his
face
remained
still
the
sweet
warm
thrill
of
his
contact
with
he
could
not
drive
that
from
him
it
would
never
completely
go
as
long
as
he
lived
what
had
happened
in
the
creek
would
live
with
him
he
did
not
deny
that
crying
voice
inside
him
it
was
easy
for
his
mouth
to
make
words
he
could
call
himself
a
fool
and
a
weakling
but
those
words
were
purely
mechanical
hollow
meaningless
the
truth
remained
it
was
a
blazing
fire
in
his
breast
a
conflagration
that
might
easily
get
the
best
of
him
a
thing
which
he
must
fight
and
triumph
over
for
his
own
salvation
he
did
not
think
of
danger
for
for
such
a
thought
was
inconceivable
the
tragedy
was
it
was
his
own
folly
his
own
danger
for
just
as
he
loved
so
did
she
love
her
husband
pierre
he
came
to
the
low
ridge
close
to
the
river
and
climbed
up
through
the
thick
birches
and
poplars
at
the
top
was
a
bald
knob
of
sandstone
over
which
the
riverman
had
already
passed
david
paused
there
and
looked
down
on
the
broad
sweep
of
the
athabasca
what
he
saw
was
like
a
picture
spread
out
on
the
great
breast
of
the
river
and
the
white
strip
of
shoreline
still
a
quarter
of
a
mile
upstream
floating
down
slowly
with
the
current
was
a
mighty
raft
and
for
a
space
his
eyes
took
in
nothing
else
on
the
mackenzie
the
athabasca
the
saskatchewan
and
the
peace
he
had
seen
many
rafts
but
never
a
raft
like
this
of
pierre
boulain
it
was
a
hundred
feet
in
width
and
twice
and
a
half
times
as
long
and
with
the
sun
blazing
down
upon
it
from
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
it
looked
to
him
like
a
little
city
swept
up
from
out
of
some
archaic
and
savage
desert
land
to
be
transplanted
to
the
river
it
was
dotted
with
tents
and
canvas
shelters
some
of
these
were
gray
and
some
were
white
and
two
or
three
were
striped
with
broad
bands
of
yellow
and
red
behind
all
these
was
a
cabin
and
over
this
there
rose
a
slender
staff
from
which
floated
the
black
and
white
pennant
of
pierre
the
raft
was
alive
men
were
running
between
the
tents
the
long
rudder
sweeps
were
flashing
in
the
sun
rowers
with
naked
arms
and
shoulders
were
straining
their
muscles
in
four
york
boats
that
were
pulling
like
ants
at
the
giant
mass
of
timber
and
to
david
ears
came
a
deep
monotone
of
human
voices
the
chanting
of
the
men
as
they
worked
nearer
to
him
a
louder
response
suddenly
made
answer
to
it
a
dozen
steps
carried
him
round
a
projecting
thumb
of
brush
and
he
could
see
the
open
shore
where
the
bateau
was
tied
had
crossed
the
strip
of
sand
and
bateese
was
helping
her
into
a
waiting
york
boat
then
bateese
shoved
it
off
and
the
four
men
in
it
began
to
row
two
canoes
were
already
to
the
raft
and
david
recognized
the
occupant
of
one
of
them
as
andre
the
broken
man
then
he
saw
rise
in
the
york
boat
and
wave
something
white
in
her
hand
he
looked
again
toward
the
raft
the
current
and
the
sweeps
and
the
tugging
boats
were
drawing
it
steadily
nearer
standing
at
the
very
edge
of
it
he
saw
now
a
solitary
figure
and
in
the
clear
sunlight
the
man
stood
out
as
a
carven
statue
he
was
a
giant
in
size
his
head
and
arms
were
bare
and
he
was
looking
steadily
toward
the
bateau
and
the
approaching
york
boat
he
raised
an
arm
and
a
moment
later
the
movement
was
followed
by
a
voice
that
rose
above
all
other
voices
it
boomed
over
the
river
like
the
rumble
of
a
gun
in
response
to
it
waved
the
white
thing
in
her
hand
and
david
thought
he
heard
her
voice
in
an
answering
cry
he
stared
again
at
the
solitary
figure
of
the
man
seeing
nothing
else
hearing
no
other
sound
but
the
booming
of
the
deep
cry
that
came
again
over
the
river
his
heart
was
thumping
in
his
eyes
was
a
gathering
fire
his
body
grew
tense
for
he
knew
that
at
last
he
was
looking
at
pierre
chief
of
the
boulains
and
husband
of
the
woman
he
loved
as
the
significance
of
the
situation
grew
upon
him
a
flash
of
his
old
humor
returned
it
was
the
same
grim
humor
that
had
possessed
him
behind
the
rock
when
he
had
thought
he
was
going
to
die
fate
had
played
him
a
dishonest
turn
then
and
it
was
doing
the
same
thing
by
him
now
unless
he
deliberately
turned
his
face
away
he
was
going
to
see
the
reunion
of
and
pierre
yesterday
he
had
strapped
his
binoculars
to
his
belt
today
had
looked
through
them
a
dozen
times
they
had
been
a
source
of
pleasure
and
thrill
to
her
now
david
thought
they
would
be
good
medicine
for
him
he
would
see
the
whole
thing
through
and
at
close
range
he
would
leave
himself
no
room
for
doubt
he
had
laughed
behind
the
rock
when
bullets
were
zipping
close
to
his
head
and
the
same
grim
smile
came
to
his
lips
now
as
he
focused
his
glasses
on
the
solitary
figure
at
the
head
of
the
raft
the
smile
died
away
when
he
saw
pierre
it
was
as
if
he
could
reach
out
and
touch
him
with
his
hand
and
never
he
thought
had
he
seen
such
a
man
a
moment
before
a
flashing
vision
had
come
to
him
from
out
of
an
arabian
desert
the
multitude
of
colored
tents
the
men
the
great
raft
floating
almost
without
perceptible
motion
on
the
placid
breast
of
the
river
had
stirred
his
imagination
until
he
saw
a
strange
picture
but
there
was
nothing
arabic
nothing
in
this
man
his
binoculars
brought
within
a
few
feet
of
his
eyes
he
was
more
like
a
viking
pirate
who
had
roved
the
sea
a
few
centuries
ago
one
great
bare
arm
was
raised
as
david
looked
and
his
booming
voice
was
rolling
over
the
river
again
his
hair
was
shaggy
and
untrimmed
and
red
he
wore
a
short
beard
that
glistened
in
the
sun
he
was
laughing
as
he
waved
and
shouted
to
a
joyous
splendid
giant
of
a
man
who
seemed
almost
on
the
point
of
leaping
into
the
water
in
his
eagerness
to
clasp
in
his
naked
arms
the
woman
who
was
coming
to
him
david
drew
a
deep
breath
and
there
came
an
unconscious
tightening
at
his
heart
as
he
turned
his
glasses
upon
she
was
still
standing
in
the
bow
of
the
york
boat
and
her
back
was
toward
him
he
could
see
the
glisten
of
the
sun
in
her
hair
she
was
waving
her
handkerchief
and
the
poise
of
her
slim
body
told
him
that
in
her
eagerness
she
would
have
darted
from
the
bow
of
the
boat
had
she
possessed
wings
again
he
looked
at
pierre
and
this
was
the
man
who
was
no
match
for
concombre
bateese
it
was
inconceivable
yet
he
heard
voice
repeating
those
very
words
in
his
ear
but
she
had
surely
been
joking
with
him
she
had
been
storing
up
this
little
surprise
for
him
she
had
wanted
him
to
discover
with
his
own
eyes
what
a
splendid
man
was
this
chief
of
the
boulains
and
yet
as
david
stared
there
came
to
him
an
unpleasant
thought
of
the
incongruity
of
this
thing
he
was
looking
upon
it
struck
upon
him
like
a
clashing
discord
the
fact
of
matehood
between
these
two
a
condition
inconsistent
and
out
of
tune
with
the
beautiful
things
he
had
built
up
in
his
mind
about
the
woman
in
his
soul
he
had
enshrined
her
as
a
lovely
wildflower
easily
crushed
easily
destroyed
a
sweet
treasure
to
be
guarded
from
all
that
was
rough
and
savage
a
little
as
fragile
as
she
was
brave
and
loyal
and
pierre
standing
there
at
the
edge
of
his
raft
looked
as
if
he
had
come
up
out
of
the
caves
of
a
million
years
ago
there
was
something
barbaric
about
him
he
needed
only
a
club
and
a
shield
and
the
skin
of
a
beast
about
his
loins
to
transform
him
into
prehistoric
man
at
least
these
were
his
first
impressions
impressions
roused
by
thought
of
slim
beautiful
body
crushed
close
in
the
embrace
of
that
laughing
giant
then
the
reaction
swept
over
him
pierre
was
not
a
monster
even
though
his
disturbed
mind
unconsciously
made
an
effort
to
conceive
him
as
such
there
were
gladness
and
laughter
in
his
face
there
was
the
contagion
of
joy
and
good
cheer
in
the
voice
that
boomed
over
the
water
laughter
and
shouts
answered
it
from
the
shore
the
rowers
in
york
boat
burst
into
a
wild
and
exultant
snatch
of
song
and
made
their
oars
fairly
crack
there
came
a
solitary
yell
from
andre
the
broken
man
who
was
close
to
the
head
of
the
raft
now
and
from
the
raft
itself
came
a
slowly
swelling
volume
of
sound
the
urge
and
voice
and
exultation
of
men
with
the
glory
of
this
day
and
the
wild
freedom
of
their
world
the
truth
came
to
david
pierre
boulain
was
the
beloved
big
brother
of
his
people
he
waited
his
muscles
tense
his
jaws
set
tight
good
medicine
he
called
it
again
a
righteous
sort
of
punishment
set
upon
him
for
the
moral
cowardice
he
had
betrayed
in
falling
down
in
worship
at
the
feet
of
another
man
wife
the
york
boat
was
very
close
to
the
head
of
the
raft
now
he
saw
herself
fling
a
rope
to
pierre
then
the
boat
swung
alongside
in
another
moment
pierre
had
leaned
over
and
was
with
him
on
the
raft
for
a
space
everything
else
in
the
world
was
obliterated
for
david
he
saw
pierre
arms
gather
the
slim
form
into
their
embrace
he
saw
hands
go
up
fondly
to
the
bearded
face
and
then
carrigan
cut
the
picture
there
he
turned
his
shoulder
to
the
raft
and
snapped
the
binoculars
in
the
case
at
his
belt
some
one
was
coming
in
his
direction
from
the
bateau
it
was
the
riverman
who
had
brought
to
the
news
of
pierre
arrival
david
went
down
to
meet
him
from
the
foot
of
the
ridge
he
again
turned
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
raft
pierre
and
were
just
about
to
enter
the
little
cabin
built
in
the
center
of
the
drifting
mass
of
timber
xv
it
was
easy
for
carrigan
to
guess
why
the
riverman
had
turned
back
for
him
men
were
busy
about
the
bateau
and
concombre
bateese
stood
in
the
stern
a
long
pole
in
his
hands
giving
commands
to
the
others
the
bateau
was
beginning
to
swing
out
into
the
stream
when
he
leaped
aboard
a
wide
grin
spread
over
the
face
he
eyed
david
keenly
and
laughed
in
his
deep
chest
an
unmistakable
suggestiveness
in
the
note
of
it
you
look
seek
he
said
in
an
undertone
for
david
ears
alone
you
look
ver
unhappy
an
pale
lak
leetle
boy
wat
happen
you
look
ze
glass
up
there
eh
or
ees
it
zat
you
grow
frighten
because
ver
soon
you
stan
up
an
fight
concombre
bateese
eh
coq
de
bruyere
ees
it
zat
a
quick
thought
came
to
david
is
it
true
that
pierre
can
not
whip
you
bateese
bateese
threw
out
his
chest
with
a
mighty
intake
of
breath
then
he
exploded
no
man
on
all
river
can
concombre
bateese
and
pierre
is
a
powerful
man
mused
david
letting
his
eyes
travel
slowly
from
the
moccasined
feet
to
the
top
of
his
head
i
measured
him
well
through
the
glasses
bateese
it
will
be
a
great
fight
but
i
shall
whip
you
he
did
not
wait
for
the
to
reply
but
went
into
the
cabin
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
did
not
like
the
taunting
note
of
suggestiveness
in
the
other
words
was
it
possible
that
bateese
suspected
the
true
state
of
his
mind
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
wife
of
pierre
and
that
his
heart
was
sick
because
of
what
he
had
seen
aboard
the
raft
he
flushed
hotly
it
made
him
uncomfortable
to
feel
that
even
the
might
have
guessed
his
humiliation
david
looked
through
the
window
toward
the
raft
the
bateau
was
drifting
downstream
possibly
a
hundred
feet
from
the
shore
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
concombre
bateese
was
making
no
effort
to
bring
it
close
to
the
floating
mass
of
timber
which
had
made
no
change
in
its
course
down
the
river
david
mind
painted
swiftly
what
was
happening
in
the
cabin
into
which
and
pierre
had
disappeared
at
this
moment
was
telling
of
him
of
the
adventure
in
the
hot
patch
of
sand
he
fancied
the
suppressed
excitement
in
her
voice
as
she
unburdened
herself
he
saw
pierre
face
darken
his
muscles
tighten
and
crouching
in
silence
he
seemed
to
see
the
misshapen
hulk
of
andre
the
broken
man
listening
to
what
was
passing
between
the
other
two
and
he
heard
again
the
mad
monotone
of
andre
voice
crying
plaintively
has
any
one
seen
black
roger
audemard
his
blood
ran
a
little
faster
and
his
old
craft
was
a
dominantly
living
thing
within
him
once
more
love
had
dulled
both
his
ingenuity
and
his
desire
for
a
space
a
thing
had
risen
before
him
that
was
mightier
than
the
majesty
of
the
law
and
he
had
tried
to
miss
the
because
of
his
love
for
the
wife
of
pierre
boulain
now
he
shot
squarely
for
it
and
the
bell
rang
in
his
brain
two
times
two
again
made
four
facts
assembled
themselves
like
arguments
in
flesh
and
blood
those
facts
would
have
convinced
superintendent
mcvane
and
they
now
convinced
david
he
had
set
out
to
get
black
roger
audemard
alive
or
dead
and
black
roger
wholesale
murderer
a
monster
who
had
painted
the
blackest
page
of
crime
known
in
the
history
of
canadian
law
was
closely
and
vitally
associated
with
and
pierre
boulain
the
thing
was
a
shock
but
carrigan
no
longer
tried
to
evade
the
point
his
business
was
no
longer
with
a
man
supposed
to
be
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
miles
farther
north
it
was
with
pierre
and
andre
the
broken
man
and
also
with
concombre
bateese
he
smiled
a
little
grimly
as
he
thought
of
his
approaching
battle
with
the
pierre
would
be
astounded
at
the
proposition
he
had
in
store
for
him
but
he
was
sure
that
pierre
would
accept
and
then
if
he
won
the
fight
with
bateese
the
smile
faded
from
his
lips
his
face
grew
older
as
he
looked
slowly
about
the
bateau
cabin
with
its
sweet
and
lingering
whispers
of
a
woman
presence
it
was
a
part
of
her
it
breathed
of
her
fragrance
and
her
beauty
it
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
her
crying
softly
for
her
return
yet
once
had
there
been
another
woman
even
lovelier
than
the
wife
of
pierre
he
had
not
hesitated
then
without
great
effort
he
had
triumphed
over
the
loveliness
of
carmin
fanchet
and
had
sent
her
brother
to
the
hangman
and
now
as
he
recalled
those
days
the
truth
came
to
him
that
even
in
the
darkest
hour
carmin
fanchet
had
made
not
the
slightest
effort
to
buy
him
off
with
her
beauty
she
had
not
tried
to
lure
him
she
had
fought
proudly
and
defiantly
and
had
done
that
his
fingers
clenched
slowly
and
a
thickening
came
in
his
throat
would
she
tell
pierre
of
the
many
hours
they
had
spent
together
would
she
confess
to
him
the
secret
of
that
precious
moment
when
she
had
lain
close
against
his
breast
her
arms
about
him
her
face
pressed
to
his
would
she
speak
to
him
of
secret
hours
of
warm
flushes
that
had
come
to
her
face
of
glowing
fires
that
at
times
had
burned
in
her
eyes
when
he
had
been
very
near
to
her
would
she
reveal
everything
to
pierre
her
husband
he
was
powerless
to
combat
the
voice
that
told
him
no
carmin
fanchet
had
fought
him
openly
as
an
enemy
and
had
not
employed
her
beauty
as
a
weapon
had
put
in
his
way
a
great
temptation
what
he
was
thinking
seemed
to
him
like
a
sacrilege
yet
he
knew
there
could
be
no
discriminating
distinctions
between
weapons
now
that
he
was
determined
to
play
the
game
to
the
end
for
the
law
when
carrigan
went
out
on
deck
the
was
sweating
from
his
exertion
at
the
stern
sweep
he
looked
at
the
agent
de
police
who
was
going
to
fight
him
perhaps
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
there
was
a
change
in
carrigan
he
was
not
the
same
man
who
had
gone
into
the
cabin
an
hour
before
and
the
fact
impressed
itself
upon
bateese
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
that
held
back
the
loose
talk
at
the
end
of
concombre
tongue
and
so
it
was
carrigan
himself
who
spoke
first
when
will
this
man
pierre
come
to
see
me
he
demanded
if
he
does
come
soon
i
shall
go
to
him
for
an
instant
concombre
face
darkened
then
as
he
bent
over
the
sweep
with
his
great
back
to
david
he
chuckled
audibly
and
said
would
you
go
ah
it
is
le
malade
over
there
in
the
cabin
surely
you
would
not
break
in
upon
their
bateese
did
not
look
over
his
shoulder
and
so
he
did
not
see
the
hot
flush
that
gathered
in
david
face
but
david
was
sure
he
knew
it
was
there
and
that
concombre
had
guessed
the
truth
of
matters
there
was
a
sly
note
in
his
voice
as
if
he
could
not
quite
keep
to
himself
his
exultation
that
beauty
and
bright
eyes
had
played
a
clever
trick
on
this
man
who
if
his
own
judgment
had
been
followed
would
now
be
resting
peacefully
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
it
was
the
final
stab
to
carrigan
his
muscles
tensed
for
the
first
time
he
felt
the
desire
to
shoot
a
naked
fist
into
the
grinning
mouth
of
concombre
bateese
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
and
bateese
turned
about
slowly
he
saw
what
was
in
the
other
eyes
until
this
moment
i
have
not
known
what
a
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
fight
you
bateese
said
david
quietly
make
it
tomorrow
in
the
morning
if
you
wish
take
word
to
pierre
that
i
will
make
him
a
great
wager
that
i
win
a
gamble
so
large
that
i
think
he
will
be
afraid
to
cover
it
for
i
do
think
much
of
this
pierre
of
yours
bateese
i
believe
him
to
be
a
bluff
like
yourself
and
also
a
coward
mark
my
word
he
will
be
so
much
afraid
that
he
will
not
accept
my
wager
bateese
did
not
answer
he
was
looking
over
david
shoulder
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
what
the
other
had
said
yet
there
had
come
a
sudden
gleam
of
exultation
in
his
eyes
and
he
replied
still
gazing
toward
the
raft
diantre
coq
de
bruyere
may
keep
ze
beeg
word
in
hees
mout
see
st
pierre
he
ees
comin
to
answer
for
himself
mon
dieu
i
hope
he
does
not
wring
ze
leetle
rooster
neck
for
zat
would
spoil
wan
great
gran
fight
tomorrow
david
turned
toward
the
big
raft
at
the
distance
which
separated
them
he
could
make
out
the
giant
figure
of
pierre
boulain
getting
into
a
canoe
the
form
already
in
that
canoe
he
knew
was
the
broken
man
he
could
not
see
very
lightly
bateese
touched
his
arm
will
go
into
ze
cabin
he
suggested
softly
if
happens
it
ees
bes
too
many
eyes
do
not
see
it
you
understan
agent
de
police
carrigan
nodded
i
understand
he
said
xvi
in
the
cabin
david
waited
he
did
not
look
through
the
window
to
watch
pierre
approach
he
sat
down
and
picked
up
a
magazine
from
the
table
upon
which
lay
he
was
cool
as
ice
now
his
blood
flowed
evenly
and
his
pulse
beat
unhurriedly
never
had
he
felt
himself
more
his
own
master
more
like
grappling
with
a
situation
pierre
was
coming
to
fight
he
had
no
doubt
of
that
perhaps
not
physically
at
first
but
one
way
or
another
something
dynamic
was
bound
to
happen
in
the
bateau
cabin
within
the
next
now
that
the
impending
drama
was
close
at
hand
carrigan
scheme
of
luring
pierre
into
the
making
of
a
stupendous
wager
seemed
to
him
rather
ridiculous
with
calculating
coldness
he
was
forced
to
concede
that
pierre
would
be
somewhat
of
a
fool
to
accept
the
wager
he
had
in
mind
when
he
was
so
completely
in
pierre
power
for
and
the
chief
of
the
boulains
the
bottom
of
the
river
would
undoubtedly
be
the
best
and
easiest
solution
and
the
suggestion
might
be
acted
upon
after
all
as
his
mind
charged
itself
for
the
approaching
struggle
david
found
himself
staring
at
a
double
page
in
the
magazine
given
up
entirely
to
impossibly
slim
young
creatures
exhibiting
certain
bits
of
illusive
and
mysterious
feminine
apparel
had
expressed
her
approbation
in
the
form
of
pencil
notes
under
several
of
them
under
a
cobwebby
affair
that
wreathed
one
of
the
slim
figures
he
read
pierre
will
love
this
there
were
two
exclamation
points
after
that
particular
notation
david
replaced
the
magazine
on
the
table
and
looked
toward
the
door
no
pierre
would
not
hesitate
to
put
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
for
her
not
if
he
dave
carrigan
made
the
solution
of
the
matter
a
necessity
there
were
times
he
told
himself
when
it
was
confoundedly
embarrassing
to
force
the
letter
of
the
law
and
this
was
one
of
them
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
river
bottom
he
was
thinking
again
of
the
scraping
of
a
canoe
against
the
side
of
the
bateau
recalled
him
suddenly
to
the
moment
at
hand
he
heard
low
voices
and
one
of
them
he
knew
was
pierre
for
an
interval
the
voices
continued
frequently
so
low
that
he
could
not
distinguish
them
at
all
for
ten
minutes
he
waited
impatiently
then
the
door
swung
open
and
pierre
came
in
slowly
and
coolly
david
rose
to
meet
him
and
at
the
same
moment
the
chief
of
the
boulains
closed
the
door
behind
him
there
was
no
greeting
in
carrigan
manner
he
was
the
law
waiting
unexcited
sure
of
himself
impassive
as
a
thing
of
steel
he
was
ready
to
fight
he
expected
to
fight
it
only
remained
for
pierre
to
show
what
sort
of
fight
it
was
to
be
and
he
was
amazed
at
pierre
without
betraying
that
amazement
in
the
vivid
light
that
shot
through
the
western
windows
the
chief
of
the
boulains
stood
looking
at
david
he
wore
a
gray
flannel
shirt
open
at
the
throat
and
it
was
a
splendid
throat
david
saw
and
a
splendid
head
above
it
with
its
reddish
beard
and
hair
but
what
he
saw
chiefly
were
pierre
eyes
they
were
the
sort
of
eyes
he
disliked
to
find
in
an
enemy
a
grayish
steely
blue
that
reflected
sunlight
like
polished
flint
but
there
was
no
flash
of
in
them
now
pierre
was
neither
excited
nor
in
a
bad
humor
nor
did
carrigan
attitude
appear
to
disturb
him
in
the
least
he
was
smiling
his
eyes
glowed
with
almost
boyish
curiosity
as
he
stared
appraisingly
at
david
and
then
slowly
a
low
chuckle
of
laughter
rose
in
his
deep
chest
and
he
advanced
with
an
outstretched
hand
i
am
pierre
boulain
he
said
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
sergeant
carrigan
you
have
had
an
unfortunate
time
had
the
man
advanced
menacingly
david
would
have
felt
more
comfortable
it
was
disturbing
to
have
this
giant
come
to
him
with
an
extended
hand
of
apparent
friendship
when
he
had
anticipated
an
entirely
different
sort
of
meeting
and
pierre
was
laughing
at
him
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
he
had
the
colossal
nerve
to
tell
him
that
he
had
been
unfortunate
as
though
being
shot
up
by
wife
was
a
fairly
decent
joke
carrigan
attitude
did
not
change
he
did
not
reach
out
a
hand
to
meet
the
other
there
was
no
responsive
glimmer
of
humor
in
his
eyes
or
on
his
lips
and
seeing
these
things
pierre
turned
his
extended
hand
to
the
open
box
of
cigars
so
that
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
back
toward
him
it
funny
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
and
with
only
a
drawling
note
of
the
french
patois
in
his
voice
i
come
home
find
my
jeanne
in
a
terrible
a
stranger
in
her
room
and
the
stranger
refuses
to
let
me
laugh
or
shake
hands
with
him
tonnerre
i
say
it
is
funny
and
my
jeanne
saved
his
life
and
made
him
muffins
and
gave
him
my
own
bed
and
walked
with
him
in
the
forest
ah
the
ungrateful
cochon
he
turned
laughing
openly
so
that
his
deep
voice
filled
the
cabin
vous
aves
de
la
corde
de
pendu
yes
you
are
a
lucky
dog
for
only
one
other
man
in
the
world
would
my
jeanne
have
done
that
you
are
lucky
because
you
were
not
ended
behind
the
rock
you
are
lucky
because
you
are
not
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
you
are
lucky
he
shrugged
his
big
shoulders
hopelessly
and
now
after
all
our
kindness
and
your
good
luck
you
wait
for
me
like
an
enemy
diable
i
can
not
understand
for
the
life
of
him
carrigan
could
not
in
these
few
moments
measure
up
his
man
he
had
said
nothing
he
had
let
pierre
talk
and
now
pierre
stood
there
one
of
the
finest
men
he
had
ever
looked
upon
as
if
honestly
overcome
by
a
great
wonder
and
yet
behind
that
apparent
incredulity
in
his
voice
and
manner
david
sensed
the
deep
underflow
of
another
thing
pierre
was
all
that
had
claimed
for
him
and
more
she
had
given
him
assurance
of
her
unlimited
confidence
that
her
husband
could
adjust
any
situation
in
the
world
and
carrigan
conceded
that
pierre
measured
up
splendidly
to
that
particular
type
of
man
the
smile
had
not
left
his
face
the
good
humor
was
still
in
his
eyes
david
smiled
back
at
him
coldly
he
recognized
the
cleverness
of
the
other
play
pierre
was
a
man
who
would
smile
like
that
even
as
he
fought
and
carrigan
loved
a
smiling
fighter
even
when
he
had
to
slip
steel
bracelets
over
his
wrists
i
am
sergeant
carrigan
of
division
royal
northwest
mounted
police
he
said
repeating
the
formula
of
the
law
sit
down
pierre
and
i
will
tell
you
a
few
things
that
have
happened
and
then
non
non
it
is
not
necessary
i
have
already
listened
for
an
hour
and
i
do
not
like
to
hear
a
story
twice
you
are
of
the
police
i
love
the
police
they
are
brave
men
and
brave
men
are
my
brothers
you
are
out
after
roger
audemard
the
rascal
is
it
not
so
and
you
were
shot
at
behind
the
rock
back
there
you
were
almost
killed
ma
foi
and
it
was
my
jeanne
who
did
the
shooting
yes
she
thought
you
were
another
man
the
chuckling
note
of
laughter
came
again
out
of
pierre
great
chest
it
was
bad
shooting
i
have
taught
her
better
but
the
sun
was
blinding
there
in
the
hot
white
sand
and
after
that
i
know
everything
that
has
happened
bateese
was
wrong
i
shall
scold
him
for
wanting
to
put
you
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
perhaps
oui
ce
que
femme
veut
dieu
le
veut
that
is
it
a
woman
must
have
her
way
and
my
jeanne
gentle
heart
was
touched
because
you
were
a
brave
and
handsome
man
carrigan
but
i
am
not
jealous
jealousy
is
a
worm
that
does
not
make
friendship
and
we
shall
be
friends
only
as
a
friend
could
i
take
you
to
the
chateau
boulain
far
up
on
the
yellowknife
and
we
are
going
there
in
spite
of
what
might
have
been
the
entirely
proper
thing
to
do
at
this
particular
moment
carrigan
face
broke
into
a
smile
as
he
drew
a
second
chair
up
close
to
the
table
he
was
swift
to
readjust
himself
it
came
suddenly
back
to
him
how
he
had
grinned
behind
the
rock
when
death
seemed
close
at
hand
and
pierre
was
like
that
now
david
measured
him
again
as
the
chief
of
the
boulains
sat
down
opposite
him
such
a
man
could
not
be
afraid
of
anything
on
the
face
of
the
earth
even
of
the
law
the
gleam
that
lay
in
his
eyes
told
david
that
as
they
met
his
own
over
the
table
we
are
smiling
now
because
it
happens
to
please
us
david
read
in
them
but
in
a
moment
if
it
is
necessary
we
shall
fight
carrigan
leaned
a
little
over
the
table
you
know
we
are
not
going
to
the
chateau
boulain
pierre
he
said
we
are
going
to
stop
at
fort
mcmurray
and
there
you
and
your
wife
must
answer
for
a
number
of
things
that
have
happened
there
is
one
way
out
possibly
that
is
largely
up
to
you
why
did
your
wife
try
to
kill
me
behind
the
rock
and
what
did
you
know
about
black
roger
audemard
pierre
eyes
did
not
for
an
instant
leave
carrigan
face
slowly
a
change
came
into
them
the
smile
faded
the
blue
went
out
and
up
from
behind
seemed
to
come
another
pair
of
eyes
that
were
hard
as
steel
and
cold
as
ice
yet
they
were
not
eyes
that
threatened
nor
eyes
that
betrayed
excitement
or
passion
and
pierre
voice
when
he
spoke
lacked
the
deep
and
vibrant
note
that
had
been
in
it
it
was
as
if
he
had
placed
upon
it
the
force
of
a
mighty
will
chaining
it
back
just
as
something
hidden
and
terrible
lay
chained
behind
his
eyes
why
play
like
little
children
carrigan
he
asked
why
not
come
out
squarely
honestly
like
men
i
know
what
has
happened
mon
dieu
it
was
bad
you
were
almost
killed
and
you
heard
that
poor
wreck
andre
call
for
roger
audemard
my
jeanne
has
told
you
about
that
how
i
found
him
in
the
forest
with
his
broken
mind
and
body
and
about
my
jeanne
pierre
fists
grew
into
knotted
lumps
on
the
table
non
i
will
die
i
will
kill
you
before
i
will
tell
you
why
she
shot
at
you
behind
the
rock
we
are
men
both
of
us
we
are
not
afraid
and
you
in
my
place
what
would
you
do
in
the
moment
silence
each
man
looked
steadily
at
the
other
i
would
fight
said
david
slowly
if
it
was
for
her
i
am
pretty
sure
i
would
fight
he
believed
that
he
was
drawing
the
net
in
now
that
it
would
catch
pierre
he
leaned
a
little
farther
over
the
table
and
i
too
must
fight
he
added
you
know
our
law
pierre
we
do
go
back
without
our
man
unless
we
happen
to
die
and
i
would
be
stupid
if
i
did
not
understand
the
situation
here
it
would
be
quite
easy
for
you
to
get
rid
of
me
but
i
do
believe
you
are
a
murderer
even
if
your
jeanne
tried
to
be
a
flicker
of
a
smile
crossed
his
lips
and
i
beg
pardon
your
wife
pierre
interrupted
him
it
will
please
me
to
have
you
call
her
and
it
will
please
her
also
dieu
if
we
only
had
eyes
that
could
see
what
is
in
a
woman
heart
life
is
funny
it
is
a
great
joke
i
swear
it
on
my
soul
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
smiling
again
straight
into
david
eyes
see
what
has
happened
you
set
out
for
a
murderer
my
jeanne
makes
a
great
mistake
and
shoots
you
then
she
pities
you
saves
your
life
brings
you
here
and
ma
foi
it
is
true
learns
to
care
for
you
more
than
she
should
but
that
does
not
make
me
want
to
kill
you
non
her
happiness
is
mine
dead
men
tell
no
tales
but
there
are
times
when
living
men
also
keep
tales
to
themselves
and
that
is
what
you
are
going
to
do
carrigan
you
are
going
to
keep
to
yourself
the
thing
that
happened
behind
the
rock
you
are
going
to
keep
to
yourself
the
mumblings
of
our
poor
mad
andre
never
will
they
pass
your
lips
i
know
i
swear
it
i
stake
my
life
on
it
pierre
was
talking
slowly
and
unexcitedly
there
was
an
immeasurable
confidence
in
his
deep
voice
it
did
not
imply
a
threat
or
a
warning
he
was
sure
of
himself
and
his
eyes
had
deepened
into
blue
again
and
were
almost
friendly
you
would
stake
your
life
repeated
carrigan
questioningly
you
would
do
that
pierre
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
the
cabin
with
a
shining
light
in
his
eyes
that
was
both
pride
and
exaltation
he
moved
toward
the
end
of
the
room
where
the
piano
stood
and
for
a
moment
his
big
fingers
touched
the
keys
then
seeing
the
lacy
bit
of
handkerchief
that
lay
there
he
picked
it
up
and
placed
it
back
again
carrigan
did
not
urge
his
question
but
waited
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
fight
it
down
he
found
himself
in
the
grip
of
a
mysterious
and
growing
thrill
as
he
watched
pierre
never
had
the
presence
of
another
man
had
the
same
effect
upon
him
and
strangely
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
was
matched
even
overmatched
it
was
as
if
pierre
had
brought
with
him
into
the
cabin
something
more
than
the
splendid
strength
of
his
body
a
thing
that
reached
out
in
the
interval
of
silence
between
them
warning
carrigan
that
all
the
law
in
the
world
would
not
swerve
the
chief
of
the
boulains
from
what
was
already
in
his
mind
for
a
moment
the
thought
passed
from
david
that
fate
had
placed
him
up
against
the
hazard
of
enmity
with
pierre
his
vision
centered
in
the
man
alone
and
as
he
too
rose
to
his
feet
an
unconscious
smile
came
to
his
lips
as
he
recalled
the
boastings
of
bateese
i
ask
you
said
he
if
you
would
really
stake
your
life
in
a
matter
such
as
that
of
course
if
your
words
were
merely
accidental
and
meant
nothing
if
i
had
a
dozen
lives
i
would
stake
them
one
on
top
of
the
other
as
i
have
said
interrupted
pierre
suddenly
his
laugh
boomed
out
and
his
voice
became
louder
carrigan
i
have
come
to
offer
you
just
that
test
oui
i
could
kill
you
now
i
could
put
you
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
as
bateese
thinks
is
right
mon
dieu
how
completely
i
could
make
you
disappear
and
then
my
jeanne
would
be
safe
she
would
not
go
behind
prison
bars
she
would
go
on
living
and
laughing
and
singing
in
the
big
forests
where
she
belongs
and
black
roger
audemard
the
rascal
would
be
safe
for
a
time
but
that
would
be
like
destroying
a
little
child
you
are
so
helpless
now
so
you
are
going
on
to
the
chateau
boulain
with
us
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
second
month
from
today
you
do
not
willingly
say
i
have
won
my
wager
why
i
will
go
with
you
into
the
forest
and
you
may
shoot
out
of
me
the
life
which
is
my
end
of
the
gamble
is
that
not
fair
can
you
suggest
a
better
way
between
men
like
you
and
me
i
can
at
least
suggest
a
way
that
has
the
virtue
of
saving
time
replied
david
first
however
i
must
understand
my
position
here
i
am
i
take
it
a
prisoner
a
guest
with
certain
restrictions
placed
upon
you
corrected
pierre
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
on
a
dead
level
tomorrow
morning
i
am
going
to
fight
bateese
said
david
it
is
a
little
sporting
event
we
have
fixed
up
between
us
for
the
amusement
of
your
men
i
have
heard
that
bateese
is
the
best
fighting
man
along
the
three
rivers
and
i
i
do
not
like
to
have
any
other
man
claim
that
distinction
when
i
am
around
for
the
first
time
pierre
placidity
seemed
to
leave
him
his
brow
became
clouded
a
moment
frown
grew
in
his
face
and
there
was
a
certain
disconsolate
hopelessness
in
the
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
was
as
if
carrigan
words
had
suddenly
robbed
the
day
of
all
its
sunshine
for
the
chief
of
the
boulains
his
voice
too
carried
an
unhappy
and
disappointed
note
as
he
made
a
gesture
toward
the
window
on
that
raft
out
there
are
many
of
my
men
and
they
have
scarcely
rested
or
slept
since
word
was
brought
to
them
that
a
stranger
was
to
fight
concombre
bateese
tonnerre
they
have
gambled
without
ever
seeing
you
until
the
clothes
on
their
backs
are
in
the
hazard
and
they
have
cracked
their
muscles
in
labor
to
overtake
you
they
have
prayed
away
their
very
souls
that
it
would
be
a
good
fight
and
that
bateese
would
not
eat
you
up
too
quickly
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
we
have
seen
a
good
fight
a
long
time
since
the
last
man
dared
to
stand
up
against
the
ugh
it
tears
out
my
heart
to
tell
you
that
the
fight
can
not
be
pierre
made
no
effort
to
suppress
his
emotion
he
was
like
a
huge
disappointed
boy
he
walked
to
the
window
peered
forth
at
the
raft
and
as
he
shrugged
his
big
shoulders
again
something
like
a
groan
came
from
him
the
thrill
of
approaching
triumph
swept
through
david
blood
the
flame
of
it
was
in
his
eyes
when
pierre
turned
from
the
window
and
you
are
disappointed
pierre
you
would
like
to
see
that
fight
the
blue
steel
in
pierre
eyes
flashed
back
if
the
price
were
a
year
of
my
life
i
would
give
it
if
bateese
did
not
eat
you
up
too
quickly
i
love
to
look
upon
a
good
fight
where
there
is
no
venom
of
hatred
in
the
blows
then
you
shall
see
a
good
fight
st
pierre
bateese
would
kill
you
you
are
not
big
you
are
not
his
match
i
shall
whip
him
pierre
whip
him
until
he
avows
me
his
master
you
do
not
know
the
twice
i
have
tried
him
in
friendly
combat
myself
and
have
been
beaten
but
i
shall
whip
him
repeated
carrigan
i
will
wager
you
anything
anything
in
the
world
even
life
against
life
that
i
whip
him
the
gloom
had
faded
from
the
face
of
pierre
boulain
but
in
a
moment
it
clouded
again
my
jeanne
has
made
me
promise
that
i
will
stop
the
fight
he
said
and
why
why
should
she
insist
in
a
matter
such
as
this
which
properly
should
be
settled
among
men
asked
david
again
pierre
laughed
with
an
effort
it
seemed
she
is
she
laughed
and
thought
it
quite
a
joke
when
bateese
humbled
me
my
great
pierre
with
the
blood
of
old
france
in
his
veins
beaten
by
a
man
who
has
been
named
after
a
vegetable
she
cried
i
tell
you
she
was
merry
over
it
she
laughed
until
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
but
with
you
it
is
different
she
was
white
when
she
entreated
me
not
to
let
you
fight
bateese
yes
she
is
afraid
you
will
be
badly
hurt
and
she
does
not
want
to
see
you
hurt
again
but
i
tell
you
that
i
am
not
jealous
she
does
not
try
to
hide
things
from
me
she
tells
me
everything
like
a
little
child
and
so
i
am
going
to
fight
bateese
said
david
he
wondered
if
pierre
could
hear
the
thumping
of
his
heart
or
if
his
face
gave
betrayal
of
the
hot
flood
it
was
pumping
through
his
body
bateese
and
i
have
pledged
ourselves
we
shall
fight
unless
you
tie
one
of
us
hand
and
foot
and
as
for
a
wager
yes
what
have
you
to
wager
demanded
pierre
eagerly
you
know
the
odds
are
great
temporized
carrigan
that
i
concede
but
a
fight
without
a
wager
would
be
like
a
pipe
without
tobacco
st
pierre
you
speak
truly
david
came
nearer
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
other
arm
pierre
i
hope
you
and
your
jeanne
will
understand
what
i
am
about
to
offer
it
is
this
if
bateese
whips
me
i
will
disappear
into
the
forests
and
no
word
shall
ever
pass
my
lips
of
what
has
passed
since
that
hour
behind
the
rock
and
this
no
whisper
of
it
will
ever
reach
the
law
i
will
forget
the
attempted
murder
and
the
suspicious
mumblings
of
your
broken
man
you
will
be
safe
your
jeanne
will
be
safe
if
bateese
whips
me
he
paused
and
waited
pierre
made
no
answer
but
amazement
came
into
his
face
and
after
that
a
slow
and
burning
fire
in
his
eyes
which
told
how
deeply
and
vitally
carrigan
words
had
struck
into
his
soul
and
if
i
should
happen
to
win
continued
david
turning
a
bit
carelessly
toward
the
window
why
i
should
expect
as
large
a
payment
from
you
if
i
win
your
fulfillment
of
the
wager
will
be
to
tell
me
in
every
detail
why
your
wife
tried
to
kill
me
behind
the
rock
and
you
will
also
tell
me
all
that
you
know
about
the
man
i
am
after
black
roger
audemard
that
is
all
i
am
asking
for
no
odds
though
you
concede
the
handicap
is
great
he
did
not
look
at
pierre
behind
him
he
heard
the
other
deep
breathing
for
a
space
neither
spoke
outside
they
could
hear
the
soft
swish
of
water
the
low
voices
of
men
in
the
stern
and
a
shout
and
the
barking
of
a
dog
coming
from
the
raft
far
out
on
the
river
for
david
the
moment
was
one
of
suspense
he
turned
again
a
bit
carelessly
as
if
his
proposition
were
a
matter
of
but
little
significance
to
him
pierre
was
not
looking
at
him
he
was
staring
toward
the
door
as
if
through
it
he
could
see
the
powerful
form
of
bateese
bending
over
the
stern
sweep
and
carrigan
could
see
that
his
face
was
flaming
with
a
great
desire
and
that
the
blood
in
his
body
was
pounding
to
the
mighty
urge
of
it
suddenly
he
faced
carrigan
listen
to
me
he
said
you
are
a
brave
man
you
are
a
man
of
honor
and
i
know
you
will
bury
sacredly
in
your
heart
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
and
never
let
a
word
of
it
escape
even
to
my
jeanne
i
do
not
blame
you
for
loving
her
non
you
could
not
help
that
you
have
fought
well
to
keep
it
within
yourself
and
for
that
i
honor
you
how
do
i
know
mon
dieu
she
has
told
me
a
woman
heart
understands
and
a
woman
ears
are
quick
to
hear
when
you
were
sick
and
your
mind
was
wandering
you
told
her
again
and
again
that
you
loved
her
and
when
she
brought
you
back
to
life
her
eyes
saw
more
than
once
the
truth
of
what
your
lips
had
betrayed
though
you
tried
to
keep
it
to
yourself
even
more
she
felt
the
touch
of
your
lips
on
her
hair
that
day
she
understands
she
has
told
me
everything
openly
innocently
yet
her
heart
thrills
with
that
sympathy
of
a
woman
who
knows
she
is
loved
if
you
could
have
seen
the
light
in
her
eyes
and
the
glow
in
her
cheeks
as
she
told
me
these
secrets
but
i
am
not
jealous
non
it
is
only
because
you
are
a
brave
man
and
one
of
honor
that
i
tell
you
all
this
she
would
die
of
shame
did
she
know
i
had
betrayed
her
confidence
yet
it
is
necessary
that
i
tell
you
because
if
we
make
the
big
wager
we
must
drop
my
jeanne
from
the
gamble
do
you
comprehend
me
we
are
two
men
strong
men
fighting
men
i
pierre
boulain
can
not
feel
the
shame
of
jealousy
where
a
woman
heart
is
pure
and
sweet
and
where
a
man
has
fought
against
love
with
honor
as
you
have
fought
and
you
david
carrigan
of
the
police
can
not
strike
with
your
hard
man
hand
that
tender
heart
that
is
like
a
flower
and
which
this
moment
is
beating
faster
than
it
should
with
the
fear
that
some
harm
is
going
to
befall
you
is
it
not
so
we
will
make
the
wager
yes
but
if
you
whip
bateese
and
you
can
not
do
that
in
a
hundred
years
of
fighting
i
will
not
tell
you
why
my
jeanne
shot
at
you
behind
the
rock
non
never
yet
i
swear
i
will
tell
you
the
other
if
you
win
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
about
roger
audemard
and
that
is
considerable
do
you
agree
slowly
david
held
out
a
hand
pierre
gripped
it
the
fingers
of
the
two
men
met
like
bands
of
steel
tomorrow
you
will
fight
said
pierre
you
will
fight
and
be
beaten
so
terribly
that
you
may
always
show
the
marks
of
it
i
am
sorry
such
a
man
as
you
i
would
rather
have
as
a
brother
than
an
enemy
and
she
will
never
forgive
me
she
will
always
remember
it
the
thought
will
never
die
out
of
her
heart
that
i
was
a
beast
to
let
you
fight
bateese
but
it
is
best
for
all
and
my
men
ah
diable
but
it
will
be
great
sport
for
them
his
hand
unclasped
he
turned
to
the
door
a
moment
later
it
closed
behind
him
and
david
was
alone
he
had
not
spoken
he
had
not
replied
to
the
engulfing
truths
that
had
fallen
quietly
and
without
a
betrayal
of
passion
from
pierre
lips
inwardly
he
was
crushed
yet
his
face
was
like
stone
hiding
his
shame
and
then
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
from
outside
that
sent
the
blood
through
his
cold
veins
again
it
was
laughter
the
great
booming
laughter
of
pierre
it
was
not
the
merriment
of
a
man
whose
heart
was
bleeding
or
into
whose
life
had
come
an
unexpected
pain
or
grief
it
was
wild
and
free
and
filled
with
the
joy
of
the
day
and
david
listening
to
it
felt
something
that
was
more
than
admiration
for
this
man
growing
within
him
and
unconsciously
his
lips
repeated
pierre
words
tomorrow
you
will
fight
xvii
for
many
minutes
david
stood
at
the
bateau
window
and
watched
the
canoe
that
carried
pierre
boulain
and
the
broken
man
back
to
the
raft
it
moved
slowly
as
if
pierre
was
loitering
with
a
purpose
and
was
thinking
deeply
of
what
had
passed
carrigan
fingers
tightened
and
his
face
grew
tense
as
he
gazed
out
into
the
glow
of
the
western
sun
now
that
the
stress
of
moments
in
the
cabin
was
over
he
no
longer
made
an
effort
to
preserve
the
veneer
of
coolness
and
decision
with
which
he
had
encountered
the
chief
of
the
boulains
deep
in
his
soul
he
was
crushed
and
humiliated
every
nerve
in
his
body
was
bleeding
he
had
heard
pierre
big
laugh
a
moment
before
but
it
must
have
been
the
laugh
of
a
man
who
was
stabbed
to
the
heart
and
he
was
going
back
to
like
that
drifting
scarcely
faster
than
the
current
that
he
might
steal
time
to
strengthen
himself
before
he
looked
into
her
eyes
again
david
could
see
him
motionless
his
giant
shoulders
hunched
forward
a
little
his
head
bowed
and
in
the
stern
the
broken
man
paddled
listlessly
his
eyes
on
the
face
of
his
master
without
voice
david
cursed
himself
in
his
egoism
he
had
told
himself
that
he
had
made
a
splendid
fight
in
resisting
the
temptation
of
a
great
love
for
the
wife
of
pierre
but
what
was
his
own
struggle
compared
with
this
tragedy
which
pierre
was
now
facing
he
turned
from
the
window
and
looked
about
the
cabin
room
again
the
woman
room
and
pierre
and
his
face
burned
in
its
silent
accusation
like
a
living
thing
it
painted
another
picture
for
him
for
a
space
he
lost
his
own
identity
he
saw
himself
in
the
place
of
pierre
he
was
the
husband
of
worshipping
her
even
as
pierre
must
worship
her
and
he
came
as
pierre
had
come
to
find
a
stranger
in
his
home
a
stranger
who
had
lain
in
his
bed
a
stranger
whom
his
wife
had
nursed
back
to
life
a
stranger
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
his
most
inviolable
possession
who
had
told
her
of
his
love
who
had
kissed
her
who
had
held
her
close
in
his
arms
whose
presence
had
brought
a
warmer
flush
and
a
brighter
glow
into
eyes
and
cheeks
that
until
this
stranger
coming
had
belonged
only
to
him
and
he
heard
her
as
pierre
had
heard
her
pleading
with
him
to
keep
this
man
from
harm
he
heard
her
soft
voice
telling
of
the
things
that
had
passed
between
them
and
he
saw
in
her
eyes
with
almost
a
cry
he
swept
the
thought
and
the
picture
from
him
it
was
an
atrocious
thing
to
conceive
impossible
of
reality
and
yet
the
truth
would
not
go
what
would
he
have
done
in
pierre
place
he
went
to
the
window
again
yes
pierre
was
a
bigger
man
than
he
for
pierre
had
come
quietly
and
calmly
offering
a
hand
of
friendship
generous
smiling
keeping
his
hurt
to
himself
while
he
dave
carrigan
would
have
come
with
the
murder
of
man
in
his
heart
his
eyes
passed
from
the
canoe
to
the
raft
and
from
the
big
raft
to
the
hazy
billows
of
green
and
golden
forest
that
melted
off
into
interminable
miles
of
distance
beyond
the
river
he
knew
that
on
the
other
side
of
him
lay
that
same
distance
north
east
south
and
west
vast
spaces
in
an
unpeopled
world
the
same
green
and
golden
forests
ten
thousand
plains
and
rivers
and
lakes
a
million
where
romance
and
tragedy
might
remain
forever
undisturbed
the
thought
came
to
him
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
slip
out
into
that
world
and
disappear
he
almost
owed
it
to
pierre
it
was
the
voice
of
bateese
in
a
snatch
of
wild
and
discordant
song
that
brought
him
back
into
grim
reality
there
was
after
all
that
embarrassing
matter
of
justice
and
the
accursed
law
after
a
little
he
observed
that
the
canoe
was
moving
faster
and
that
andre
paddle
was
working
steadily
and
with
force
pierre
no
longer
sat
hunched
in
the
bow
his
head
was
erect
and
he
was
waving
a
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
raft
a
figure
had
come
from
the
cabin
on
the
huge
mass
of
floating
timber
david
caught
the
shimmer
of
a
dress
something
white
fluttering
over
her
head
waving
back
at
pierre
it
was
and
he
moved
away
from
the
window
he
wondered
what
was
passing
between
pierre
and
his
wife
in
the
hour
that
followed
the
bateau
kept
abreast
of
the
raft
moving
neither
faster
nor
slower
than
it
did
and
twice
he
surrendered
to
the
desire
to
scan
the
deck
of
the
floating
timbers
through
his
binoculars
but
the
cabin
held
pierre
and
and
he
saw
neither
of
them
again
until
the
sun
was
setting
then
pierre
came
out
alone
even
at
that
distance
over
the
broad
river
he
heard
the
booming
voice
of
the
chief
of
the
boulains
life
sprang
up
where
there
had
been
the
drowse
of
inactivity
aboard
the
raft
a
dozen
more
of
the
great
sweeps
were
swiftly
manned
by
men
who
appeared
suddenly
from
the
shaded
places
of
canvas
shelters
and
striped
tents
a
murmur
of
voices
rose
over
the
water
and
then
the
murmur
was
broken
by
howls
and
shouts
as
the
rivermen
ran
to
their
places
at
the
command
of
pierre
voice
and
as
the
sweeps
began
to
flash
in
the
setting
sun
it
gave
way
entirely
to
the
evening
chant
of
the
paddling
song
david
gripped
himself
as
he
listened
and
watched
the
slowly
drifting
glory
of
the
world
that
came
down
to
the
shores
of
the
river
he
could
see
pierre
clearly
for
the
bateau
had
worked
its
way
nearer
he
could
see
the
bare
heads
and
naked
arms
of
the
rivermen
at
the
sweeps
the
sweet
breath
of
the
forests
filled
his
lungs
as
that
picture
lay
before
him
and
there
came
into
his
soul
a
covetousness
and
a
yearning
where
before
there
had
been
humiliation
and
the
grim
urge
of
duty
he
could
breathe
the
air
of
that
world
he
could
look
at
its
beauty
he
could
worship
it
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
was
not
a
part
of
it
as
those
others
were
a
part
of
it
he
envied
the
men
at
the
sweeps
he
felt
his
heart
swelling
at
the
exultation
and
joy
in
their
song
they
were
going
home
home
down
the
big
rivers
home
to
the
heart
of
god
country
where
wives
and
sweethearts
and
happiness
were
waiting
for
them
and
their
visions
were
his
visions
as
he
stared
and
motionless
over
the
river
and
yet
he
was
irrevocably
an
alien
he
was
more
than
that
an
enemy
a
sent
out
on
a
trail
to
destroy
an
agent
of
a
powerful
and
merciless
force
that
carried
with
it
punishment
and
death
the
crew
of
the
bateau
had
joined
in
the
evening
song
of
the
rivermen
on
the
raft
and
over
the
ridges
and
hollows
of
the
forest
tops
red
and
green
and
gold
in
the
last
warm
glory
of
the
sun
echoed
that
chanting
voice
of
men
david
understood
now
what
pierre
command
had
been
the
huge
raft
with
its
tented
city
of
life
was
preparing
to
tie
up
for
the
night
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
the
river
widened
so
that
on
the
far
side
was
a
low
clean
shore
toward
which
the
efforts
of
the
men
at
the
sweeps
were
slowly
edging
the
raft
york
boats
shot
out
on
the
shore
side
and
dropped
anchors
that
helped
drag
the
big
craft
in
two
others
tugged
at
fastened
to
the
shoreside
bow
and
within
twenty
minutes
the
first
men
were
plunging
up
out
of
the
water
on
the
white
strip
of
beach
and
were
whipping
the
about
the
nearest
trees
david
unconsciously
was
smiling
in
the
thrill
and
triumph
of
these
last
moments
and
not
until
they
were
over
did
he
sense
the
fact
that
bateese
and
his
crew
were
bringing
the
bateau
in
to
the
opposite
shore
before
the
sun
was
quite
down
both
raft
and
were
anchored
for
the
night
as
the
shadows
of
the
distant
forests
deepened
carrigan
felt
impending
about
him
an
oppression
of
emptiness
and
loneliness
which
he
had
not
experienced
before
he
was
disappointed
that
the
bateau
had
not
tied
up
with
the
raft
already
he
could
see
men
building
fires
spirals
of
smoke
began
to
rise
from
the
shore
and
he
knew
that
the
happiest
of
all
hours
supper
time
was
close
at
hand
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
after
seven
then
he
watched
the
fading
away
of
the
sun
until
only
the
red
glow
of
it
remained
in
the
west
and
against
the
still
thicker
shadows
the
fires
of
the
rivermen
threw
up
yellow
flames
on
his
own
side
bateese
and
the
bateau
crew
were
preparing
their
meal
it
was
eight
when
a
man
he
had
not
seen
before
brought
in
his
supper
he
ate
scarcely
sensing
the
taste
of
his
food
and
half
an
hour
later
the
man
reappeared
for
the
dishes
it
was
not
quite
dark
when
he
returned
to
his
window
but
the
far
shore
was
only
an
indistinct
blur
of
gloom
the
fires
were
brighter
one
of
them
built
solely
because
of
the
rivermen
inherent
love
of
light
and
cheer
threw
the
blaze
of
its
flaming
logs
twenty
feet
into
the
air
he
wondered
what
was
doing
in
this
hour
last
night
they
had
been
together
he
had
marveled
at
the
witchery
of
the
moonlight
in
her
hair
and
eyes
he
had
told
her
of
the
beauty
of
it
she
had
smiled
she
had
laughed
softly
with
him
for
hours
they
had
sat
in
the
spell
of
the
golden
night
and
the
glory
of
the
river
and
tonight
now
was
she
with
pierre
waiting
as
they
had
waited
last
night
for
the
rising
of
the
moon
had
she
forgotten
could
she
forget
or
was
she
as
he
thought
pierre
had
painfully
tried
to
make
him
believe
innocent
of
all
the
thoughts
and
desires
that
had
come
to
him
as
he
sat
worshipping
her
in
their
stolen
hours
he
could
think
of
them
only
as
stolen
for
he
did
not
believe
had
revealed
to
her
husband
all
she
might
have
told
him
he
was
sure
he
would
never
see
her
again
as
he
had
seen
her
then
and
something
of
bitterness
rose
in
him
as
he
thought
of
that
pierre
could
he
have
seen
her
face
and
eyes
when
he
told
her
that
her
hair
in
the
moonlight
was
lovelier
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
would
have
throttled
him
with
his
naked
hands
in
that
meeting
in
the
cabin
for
pierre
code
would
not
have
had
her
eyes
droop
under
their
long
lashes
or
her
cheeks
flush
so
warmly
at
the
words
of
another
man
and
he
could
not
take
vengeance
on
the
woman
herself
no
she
had
not
told
pierre
all
she
might
have
told
there
were
things
which
she
must
have
kept
to
herself
which
she
dared
not
reveal
even
to
this
man
who
was
her
husband
shame
if
nothing
more
had
kept
her
silent
did
she
feel
that
shame
as
he
was
feeling
it
it
was
inconceivable
to
think
otherwise
and
for
that
reason
more
than
all
others
he
knew
that
she
would
not
meet
him
face
to
face
again
unless
he
forced
that
meeting
and
there
was
little
chance
of
that
for
his
pledge
with
pierre
had
eliminated
her
from
the
aftermath
of
tomorrow
drama
his
fight
with
bateese
only
when
pierre
might
stand
in
a
court
of
law
would
there
be
a
possibility
of
her
eyes
meeting
his
own
again
and
then
they
would
flame
with
the
hatred
that
at
another
time
had
been
in
the
eyes
of
carmin
fanchet
with
the
dull
stab
of
a
thing
that
of
late
had
been
growing
inside
him
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
carmin
fanchet
in
the
years
that
had
gone
since
he
had
brought
about
the
hanging
of
her
brother
last
night
and
the
night
before
strange
dreams
of
her
had
come
to
him
in
restless
slumber
it
was
disturbing
to
him
that
he
should
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
dreaming
of
her
when
he
had
gone
to
his
bed
with
a
mind
filled
to
overflowing
with
the
sweet
presence
of
boulain
and
now
his
mind
reached
out
poignantly
into
mysterious
darkness
and
doubt
even
as
the
darkness
of
night
spread
itself
in
a
thickening
canopy
over
the
river
gray
clouds
had
followed
the
sun
of
a
faultless
day
and
the
stars
were
veiled
overhead
when
david
turned
from
the
window
it
was
so
dark
in
the
cabin
that
he
could
not
see
he
did
not
light
the
lamps
but
made
his
way
to
pierre
couch
and
sat
down
in
the
silence
and
gloom
through
the
open
windows
came
to
him
the
cadence
of
the
river
and
the
forests
there
was
silence
of
human
voice
ashore
but
under
him
he
heard
the
lapping
murmur
of
water
as
it
rustled
under
the
stern
and
side
of
the
bateau
and
from
the
deep
timber
came
the
whisper
of
the
spruce
and
cedar
tops
and
the
subdued
voice
of
creatures
whose
hours
of
activity
had
come
with
the
dying
out
of
the
sun
for
a
long
time
he
sat
in
this
darkness
and
then
there
came
to
him
a
sound
that
was
different
than
the
other
sounds
a
low
monotone
of
voices
the
dipping
of
a
paddle
and
a
canoe
passed
close
under
his
windows
and
up
the
shore
he
paid
small
attention
to
it
until
a
little
later
the
canoe
returned
and
its
occupants
boarded
the
bateau
it
would
have
roused
little
interest
in
him
then
had
he
not
heard
a
voice
that
was
thrillingly
like
the
voice
of
a
woman
he
drew
his
hunched
shoulders
erect
and
stared
through
the
darkness
toward
the
door
a
moment
more
and
there
was
no
doubt
it
was
almost
shock
that
sent
the
blood
leaping
suddenly
through
his
veins
the
inconceivable
had
happened
it
was
out
there
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
bateese
then
there
came
a
heavy
knock
at
his
door
and
he
heard
the
door
open
through
it
he
saw
the
grayer
gloom
of
the
outside
night
partly
shut
out
a
heavy
shadow
called
the
voice
of
bateese
i
am
here
said
david
you
have
not
gone
to
bed
no
the
heavy
shadow
seemed
to
fade
away
and
yet
there
still
remained
a
shadow
there
david
heart
thumped
as
he
noted
the
slenderness
of
it
for
a
space
there
was
silence
and
then
will
you
light
the
lamps
david
a
soft
voice
came
to
him
i
want
to
come
in
and
i
am
afraid
of
this
terrible
darkness
he
rose
to
his
feet
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
matches
xviii
he
did
not
turn
toward
when
he
had
lighted
the
first
of
the
great
brass
lamps
hanging
at
the
side
of
the
bateau
he
went
to
the
second
and
struck
another
match
and
flooded
the
cabin
with
light
she
still
stood
silhouetted
against
the
darkness
beyond
the
cabin
door
when
he
faced
her
she
was
watching
him
her
eyes
intent
her
face
a
little
pale
he
thought
then
he
smiled
and
nodded
he
could
not
see
a
great
change
in
her
since
this
afternoon
except
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
little
more
fire
in
the
glow
of
her
eyes
they
were
looking
at
him
steadily
as
she
smiled
and
nodded
wide
beautiful
eyes
in
which
there
was
surely
no
revelation
of
shame
or
regret
and
no
very
clear
evidence
of
unhappiness
david
stared
and
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
why
is
it
that
you
sit
in
darkness
she
asked
stepping
within
and
closing
the
door
did
you
not
expect
me
to
return
and
apologize
for
leaving
you
so
suddenly
this
afternoon
it
was
impolite
afterward
i
was
ashamed
but
i
was
excited
david
i
of
course
he
hurried
to
interrupt
her
i
understand
pierre
is
a
lucky
man
i
congratulate
you
as
well
as
him
he
is
splendid
a
man
in
whom
you
can
place
great
faith
and
confidence
he
scolded
me
for
running
away
from
you
as
i
did
david
he
said
i
should
have
shown
better
courtesy
than
to
leave
like
that
one
who
was
a
guest
in
our
home
so
i
have
returned
like
a
good
child
to
make
amends
it
was
not
necessary
but
you
were
lonesome
and
in
darkness
he
nodded
yes
and
besides
she
added
so
quietly
and
calmly
that
he
was
amazed
you
know
my
sleeping
apartment
is
also
on
the
bateau
and
pierre
made
me
promise
to
say
good
night
to
you
it
is
an
imposition
cried
david
the
blood
rushing
to
his
face
you
have
given
up
all
this
to
me
why
not
let
me
go
into
that
little
room
forward
or
sleep
on
the
raft
and
you
and
pierre
pierre
would
not
leave
the
raft
replied
turning
from
him
toward
the
table
on
which
were
the
books
and
magazines
and
her
and
i
like
my
little
room
forward
pierre
he
stopped
himself
he
could
see
a
sudden
color
deepening
in
the
cheek
of
pierre
wife
as
she
made
pretense
of
looking
for
something
in
her
basket
he
felt
that
if
he
went
on
he
would
blunder
if
he
had
not
already
blundered
he
was
uncomfortable
for
he
believed
he
had
guessed
the
truth
it
was
not
quite
reasonable
to
expect
that
would
come
to
him
like
this
on
the
first
night
of
pierre
homecoming
something
had
happened
over
in
the
little
cabin
on
the
raft
he
told
himself
perhaps
there
had
been
a
quarrel
at
least
ironical
implications
on
pierre
part
and
his
sympathy
was
with
pierre
he
caught
suddenly
a
little
tremble
at
the
corner
of
mouth
as
her
face
was
turned
partly
from
him
and
he
stepped
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
so
he
could
look
at
her
fairly
if
there
had
been
unpleasantness
in
the
cabin
on
the
raft
pierre
wife
in
no
way
gave
evidence
of
it
the
color
had
deepened
to
almost
a
blush
in
her
cheeks
but
it
was
not
on
account
of
embarrassment
for
one
who
is
embarrassed
is
not
usually
amused
and
as
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
were
filled
with
the
flash
of
laughter
which
he
had
caught
her
lips
struggling
to
restrain
then
finding
a
bit
of
lace
work
with
the
needles
meshed
in
it
she
seated
herself
and
again
he
was
looking
down
on
the
droop
of
her
long
lashes
and
the
seductive
glow
of
her
lustrous
hair
yesterday
in
a
moment
of
irresistible
impulse
he
had
told
her
how
lovely
it
was
as
she
had
dressed
it
a
bewitching
crown
of
interwoven
coils
not
drawn
tightly
but
crumpled
and
soft
as
if
the
mass
of
tresses
were
openly
rebelling
at
closer
confinement
she
had
told
him
the
effect
was
entirely
accidental
largely
due
to
carelessness
and
haste
in
dressing
it
accidental
or
otherwise
it
was
the
same
tonight
and
in
the
heart
of
it
were
the
drooping
red
petals
of
a
flower
she
had
gathered
with
him
early
that
afternoon
pierre
brought
me
over
she
said
in
a
calmly
voice
as
though
she
had
expected
david
to
know
that
from
the
beginning
he
is
ashore
talking
over
important
matters
with
bateese
i
am
sure
he
will
drop
in
and
say
good
night
before
he
returns
to
the
raft
he
asked
me
to
wait
for
him
here
she
raised
her
eyes
so
clear
and
untroubled
so
quietly
unembarrassed
under
his
gaze
that
he
would
have
staked
his
life
she
had
no
suspicion
of
the
confessions
which
pierre
had
revealed
to
him
do
you
care
would
you
rather
put
out
the
lights
and
go
to
bed
he
shook
his
head
no
i
am
glad
i
was
beastly
lonesome
i
had
an
idea
he
was
on
the
point
of
blundering
again
when
he
caught
himself
the
effect
of
her
so
near
him
was
more
than
ever
disturbing
in
spite
of
pierre
her
eyes
clear
and
steady
yet
soft
as
velvet
when
they
looked
at
him
made
his
tongue
and
his
thoughts
dangerously
uncertain
you
had
an
idea
david
that
you
would
have
no
desire
to
see
me
again
after
my
talk
with
pierre
he
said
did
he
tell
you
about
it
he
said
you
were
very
fine
david
and
that
he
liked
you
and
he
told
you
it
is
determined
that
i
shall
fight
bateese
in
the
morning
yes
the
one
word
was
spoken
with
a
quiet
lack
of
excitement
even
of
interest
it
seemed
to
belie
some
of
the
things
pierre
had
told
him
and
he
could
scarcely
believe
looking
at
her
now
that
she
had
entreated
her
husband
to
prevent
the
encounter
or
that
she
had
betrayed
any
unusual
emotion
in
the
matter
at
all
i
was
afraid
you
would
object
he
could
not
keep
from
saying
it
does
not
seem
nice
to
pull
off
such
a
thing
as
that
when
there
is
a
lady
about
or
ladies
she
caught
him
up
quickly
and
he
saw
a
sudden
little
tightening
of
her
pretty
mouth
as
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
bit
of
lace
work
again
but
i
do
not
object
because
what
pierre
says
is
right
must
be
right
and
the
softness
he
thought
went
altogether
out
of
the
curve
of
her
lips
for
an
instant
in
a
flash
their
momentary
betrayal
of
vexation
was
gone
and
pierre
wife
had
replaced
the
on
the
table
and
was
on
her
feet
smiling
at
him
there
was
something
of
wild
daring
in
her
eyes
something
that
made
him
think
of
the
glory
of
adventure
he
had
seen
flaming
in
her
face
the
night
they
had
run
the
rapids
of
the
holy
ghost
tomorrow
will
be
very
unpleasant
david
she
cried
softly
bateese
will
beat
you
terribly
tonight
we
must
think
of
things
more
agreeable
he
had
never
seen
her
more
radiant
than
when
she
turned
toward
the
piano
what
the
deuce
did
it
mean
had
pierre
been
making
a
fool
of
him
she
actually
appeared
unable
to
restrain
her
elation
at
the
thought
that
bateese
would
surely
beat
him
up
he
stood
without
moving
and
made
no
effort
to
answer
her
just
before
they
had
started
on
that
thrilling
adventure
into
the
forest
which
had
ended
with
his
carrying
her
in
his
arms
she
had
gone
to
the
piano
and
had
played
for
him
now
her
fingers
touched
softly
the
same
notes
a
little
humming
trill
came
in
her
throat
and
it
seemed
to
david
that
she
was
deliberately
recalling
his
thoughts
to
the
things
that
had
happened
before
the
coming
of
pierre
he
had
not
lighted
the
lamp
over
the
piano
and
for
a
flash
her
dark
eyes
smiled
at
him
out
of
the
half
shadow
after
a
moment
she
began
to
sing
her
voice
was
low
and
without
effort
untrained
and
subdued
as
if
conscious
and
afraid
of
its
limitations
yet
so
exquisitely
sweet
that
to
david
it
was
a
new
and
still
more
wonderful
revelation
of
pierre
wife
he
drew
nearer
until
he
stood
close
at
her
side
the
dark
luster
of
her
hair
almost
touching
his
arm
her
partly
upturned
face
a
bewitching
profile
in
the
shadows
her
voice
grew
lower
almost
a
whisper
in
its
melody
as
if
meant
for
him
alone
many
times
he
had
heard
the
canadian
boat
song
but
never
as
its
words
came
now
from
the
lips
of
boulain
faintly
as
tolls
the
evening
chime
our
voices
keep
tune
and
our
oars
keep
time
soon
as
the
woods
on
shore
look
dim
we
sing
at
ann
our
parting
hymn
row
brothers
row
the
stream
runs
fast
the
rapids
are
near
and
the
daylight
past
she
paused
and
david
staring
down
at
her
shining
head
did
not
speak
her
fingers
trembled
over
the
keys
he
could
see
dimly
the
shadow
of
her
long
lashes
and
the
scent
of
crushed
violets
rose
to
him
from
the
soft
lace
about
her
throat
and
her
hair
it
is
your
music
he
whispered
i
have
never
heard
the
boat
song
like
that
he
tried
to
drag
his
eyes
from
her
face
and
hair
sensing
that
he
was
a
fighting
a
mighty
impulse
the
notes
under
her
fingers
changed
and
again
by
chance
or
design
she
was
stabbing
at
him
bringing
him
face
to
face
with
the
weakness
of
his
flesh
the
iniquity
of
his
desire
to
reach
out
his
arms
and
crumple
her
in
them
yet
she
did
not
look
up
she
did
not
see
him
as
she
began
to
sing
ave
maria
ave
maria
hear
my
cry
o
guide
my
path
where
no
harm
no
harm
is
nigh
as
she
went
on
he
knew
she
had
forgotten
to
think
of
him
with
the
reverence
of
a
prayer
the
holy
words
came
from
her
lips
slowly
softly
trembling
with
a
pathos
and
sweetness
that
told
david
they
came
not
alone
from
the
lips
but
from
the
very
soul
of
pierre
wife
and
then
oh
mother
hear
me
where
thou
art
and
guard
and
guide
my
aching
heart
my
aching
heart
the
last
words
drifted
away
into
a
whisper
and
david
was
glad
that
he
was
not
looking
into
the
face
of
pierre
wife
for
there
must
have
been
something
there
now
which
it
would
have
been
sacrilege
for
him
to
stare
at
as
he
was
staring
at
her
hair
no
sound
of
opening
door
had
come
from
behind
them
yet
pierre
had
opened
it
and
stood
there
watching
them
with
a
curious
humor
in
eyes
that
seemed
still
to
hold
a
glitter
of
the
fire
that
had
leaped
from
the
flaming
birch
logs
his
voice
was
a
shock
to
carrigan
peste
but
you
are
a
gloomy
pair
he
boomed
why
no
light
over
there
in
the
corner
and
why
sing
that
to
chase
away
the
devil
when
there
is
no
devil
near
guilt
was
in
david
heart
but
there
was
no
sting
of
venom
in
pierre
words
and
he
was
laughing
at
them
now
as
though
what
he
saw
were
a
pretty
joke
and
amused
him
late
hours
and
shady
bowers
i
say
it
should
be
a
love
song
or
something
livelier
he
cried
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
coming
toward
them
why
not
en
roulant
ma
boule
my
sweet
jeanne
you
know
that
is
my
favorite
he
suddenly
interrupted
himself
and
his
voice
rolled
out
in
a
wild
chant
that
rocked
the
cabin
the
wind
is
fresh
the
wind
is
free
en
roulant
ma
boule
the
wind
is
fresh
my
love
waits
me
rouli
roulant
ma
boule
roulant
behind
our
house
a
spring
you
see
in
it
three
ducks
swim
merrily
and
hunting
the
prince
son
went
he
with
a
silver
gun
right
fair
to
see
david
was
conscious
that
pierre
wife
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
now
she
came
out
of
shadow
into
light
and
he
was
amazed
to
see
that
she
was
laughing
back
at
pierre
and
that
her
two
were
thrust
in
her
ears
to
keep
out
the
bellow
of
her
husband
voice
she
was
not
at
all
discomfited
by
his
unexpected
appearance
but
rather
seemed
to
join
in
the
humor
of
the
thing
with
pierre
though
he
fancied
he
could
see
something
in
her
face
that
was
forced
and
uneasy
he
believed
that
under
the
surface
of
her
composure
she
was
suffering
a
distress
which
she
did
not
reveal
pierre
advanced
and
carelessly
patted
her
shoulder
with
one
of
his
big
hands
while
he
spoke
to
david
has
she
not
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
did
you
ever
hear
a
sweeter
or
as
sweet
i
say
it
is
enough
to
get
down
into
the
soul
of
a
man
unless
he
is
already
half
dead
that
voice
he
caught
eyes
her
cheeks
were
flaming
her
look
for
an
instant
flashed
lightning
as
she
halted
him
ma
foi
i
speak
it
from
the
heart
he
persisted
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
am
i
not
right
carrigan
did
you
ever
hear
a
sweeter
voice
it
is
wonderful
agreed
david
wondering
if
he
was
hazarding
too
much
good
it
fills
me
with
happiness
to
know
i
am
right
and
now
cherie
i
must
return
to
the
raft
a
shadow
of
vexation
crossed
face
you
seem
in
great
haste
plagues
and
pests
you
are
right
pretty
voice
i
am
most
anxious
to
get
back
to
my
troubles
there
and
you
will
also
bid
carrigan
she
quickly
interrupted
him
you
will
at
least
see
me
to
my
room
pierre
and
safely
put
away
for
the
night
she
held
out
her
hand
to
david
there
was
not
a
tremor
in
it
as
it
lay
for
an
instant
soft
and
warm
in
his
own
she
made
no
effort
to
withdraw
it
quickly
nor
did
her
eyes
hide
their
softness
as
they
looked
into
his
own
mutely
david
stood
as
they
went
out
he
heard
pierre
loud
voice
rumbling
about
the
darkness
of
the
night
he
heard
them
pass
along
the
side
of
the
bateau
forward
and
half
a
minute
later
he
knew
that
pierre
was
getting
into
his
canoe
the
dip
of
a
paddle
came
to
him
for
a
space
there
was
silence
and
then
from
far
out
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
river
rolled
back
the
great
voice
of
pierre
boulain
singing
the
wild
river
chant
en
roulant
ma
boule
at
the
open
window
he
listened
it
seemed
to
him
that
from
far
over
the
river
where
the
giant
raft
lay
there
came
a
faint
answer
to
the
words
of
the
song
xix
with
the
slow
approach
of
the
storm
which
was
advancing
over
the
wilderness
carrigan
felt
more
poignantly
the
growing
unrest
that
was
in
him
he
heard
the
last
of
pierre
voice
and
after
that
the
fires
on
the
distant
shore
died
out
slowly
giving
way
to
utter
blackness
faintly
there
came
to
him
the
rumbling
of
thunder
the
air
grew
heavy
and
thick
and
there
was
no
sound
of
over
the
breast
of
the
river
and
out
of
the
thick
cedar
and
spruce
and
balsam
there
came
no
cry
or
whisper
of
the
nocturnal
life
waiting
in
silence
for
the
storm
to
break
in
that
stillness
david
put
out
the
lights
in
the
cabin
and
sat
close
to
the
window
in
darkness
he
was
more
than
sleepless
every
nerve
in
his
body
demanded
action
and
his
brain
was
fired
by
strange
thoughts
until
their
vividness
seemed
to
bring
him
face
to
face
with
a
reality
that
set
his
blood
stirring
with
an
irresistible
thrill
he
believed
he
had
made
a
discovery
that
pierre
had
betrayed
himself
what
he
had
visioned
the
conclusion
he
had
arrived
at
seemed
inconceivable
yet
what
his
own
eyes
had
seen
and
his
ears
had
heard
pointed
to
the
truth
of
it
all
the
least
he
could
say
was
that
pierre
love
for
boulain
was
a
strange
sort
of
love
his
attitude
toward
her
seemed
more
like
that
of
a
man
in
the
presence
of
a
child
of
whom
he
was
fond
in
a
fatherly
sort
of
way
his
affection
as
he
had
expressed
it
was
parental
and
careless
not
for
an
instant
had
there
been
in
it
a
betrayal
of
the
lover
no
suggestion
of
the
husband
who
cared
deeply
or
who
might
be
made
jealous
by
another
man
sitting
in
darkness
thickening
with
the
nearer
approach
of
storm
david
recalled
the
stab
of
pain
mingled
with
humiliation
that
had
come
into
the
eyes
of
pierre
wife
when
she
had
stood
facing
her
husband
he
heard
again
with
a
new
understanding
the
low
note
of
pathos
in
her
voice
as
in
song
she
had
called
upon
the
mother
of
christ
to
hear
her
and
help
her
he
had
not
guessed
at
the
tragedy
of
it
then
now
he
knew
and
he
thought
of
her
lying
awake
in
the
gloom
beyond
the
bulkhead
her
eyes
were
with
tears
and
pierre
had
gone
back
to
his
raft
singing
in
the
night
where
before
there
had
been
sympathy
for
him
there
rose
a
sincere
revulsion
there
had
been
a
reason
for
pierre
masterly
possession
of
himself
and
it
had
not
been
as
he
had
thought
because
of
his
bigness
of
soul
it
was
because
he
had
not
cared
he
was
a
splendid
hypocrite
playing
his
game
well
at
the
beginning
but
betraying
the
lie
at
the
end
he
did
not
love
as
he
dave
carrigan
loved
her
he
had
spoken
of
her
as
a
child
and
he
had
treated
her
as
a
child
and
was
serenely
dispassionate
in
the
face
of
a
situation
which
would
have
roused
the
spirit
in
most
men
and
suddenly
recalling
that
thrilling
hour
in
the
white
strip
of
sand
and
all
that
had
happened
since
it
flashed
upon
david
that
pierre
was
using
his
wife
as
the
vital
moving
force
in
a
game
of
his
own
that
under
the
masquerade
of
his
apparent
faith
and
bigness
of
character
he
was
sacrificing
her
to
achieve
a
certain
mysterious
something
it
the
scheme
of
his
own
affairs
yet
he
could
not
forget
the
infinite
faith
boulain
had
expressed
in
her
husband
there
had
been
no
hypocrisy
in
her
waiting
and
her
watching
for
him
or
in
her
belief
that
he
would
straighten
out
the
tangles
of
the
dilemma
in
which
she
had
become
involved
nor
had
there
been
in
the
manner
she
had
left
him
that
day
in
her
eagerness
to
go
to
pierre
adding
these
facts
as
he
had
added
the
others
he
fancied
he
saw
the
truth
staring
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
of
his
cabin
room
loved
her
husband
and
pierre
was
merely
the
possessor
careless
and
indifferent
almost
brutally
dispassionate
in
his
consideration
of
her
a
heavy
crash
of
thunder
brought
carrigan
back
to
a
realization
of
the
impending
storm
he
rose
to
his
feet
in
the
chaotic
gloom
facing
the
bulkhead
beyond
which
he
was
certain
pierre
wife
lay
wide
awake
he
tried
to
laugh
it
was
inexcusable
he
told
himself
to
let
his
thoughts
become
involved
in
the
family
affairs
of
pierre
and
that
was
not
his
business
in
the
final
analysis
did
not
appear
to
be
especially
abused
and
her
mind
was
not
a
child
mind
probably
she
would
not
thank
him
for
his
interest
in
the
matter
she
would
tell
him
like
any
other
woman
with
pride
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
and
that
he
was
presuming
upon
forbidden
ground
he
went
to
the
window
there
was
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
and
unfastening
the
screen
he
thrust
out
his
head
and
shoulders
into
the
night
it
was
so
black
that
he
could
not
see
the
shadow
of
the
water
almost
within
reach
of
his
hands
but
through
the
chaos
of
gloom
that
lay
between
him
and
the
opposite
shore
he
made
out
a
single
point
of
yellow
light
he
was
positive
the
light
was
in
the
cabin
on
the
raft
and
pierre
was
probably
in
that
cabin
a
huge
drop
of
rain
splashed
on
his
hand
and
behind
him
he
heard
sweeping
over
the
forest
tops
the
quickening
march
of
the
deluge
there
was
no
crash
of
thunder
or
flash
of
lightning
when
it
broke
straight
down
in
an
inundation
it
came
out
of
a
sky
thick
enough
to
slit
with
a
knife
carrigan
drew
in
his
head
and
shoulders
and
sniffed
the
sweet
freshness
of
it
he
tried
again
to
make
out
the
light
on
the
raft
but
it
was
obliterated
mechanically
he
began
taking
off
his
clothes
and
in
a
few
moments
he
stood
again
at
the
window
naked
thunder
and
lightning
had
caught
up
with
the
rain
and
in
the
flashes
of
fire
carrigan
face
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
raft
in
his
veins
was
at
work
an
insistent
and
impelling
desire
over
there
was
pierre
he
was
undoubtedly
in
the
cabin
and
something
might
happen
if
he
dave
carrigan
took
advantage
of
storm
and
gloom
to
go
to
the
raft
it
was
almost
a
presentiment
that
drew
his
bare
head
and
shoulders
out
through
the
window
and
every
hunting
instinct
in
him
urged
him
to
the
adventure
the
stygian
darkness
was
torn
again
by
a
flash
of
fire
in
it
he
saw
the
river
and
the
vivid
silhouette
of
the
distant
shore
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
swim
and
it
would
be
good
training
for
tomorrow
like
a
badger
worming
his
way
out
of
a
hole
a
bit
too
small
for
him
carrigan
drew
himself
through
the
window
a
lightning
flash
caught
him
at
the
edge
of
the
bateau
and
he
slunk
back
quickly
against
the
cabin
with
the
thought
that
other
eyes
might
be
staring
out
into
that
same
darkness
in
the
pitch
gloom
that
followed
he
lowered
himself
quietly
into
the
river
thrust
himself
under
water
and
struck
out
for
the
opposite
shore
when
he
came
to
the
surface
again
it
was
in
the
glare
of
another
lightning
flash
he
flung
the
water
from
his
face
chose
a
point
several
hundred
yards
above
the
raft
and
with
quick
powerful
strokes
set
out
in
its
direction
for
ten
minutes
he
quartered
the
current
without
raising
his
head
then
he
paused
floating
unresistingly
with
the
slow
sweep
of
the
river
and
waited
for
another
illumination
when
it
came
he
made
out
the
tented
raft
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
away
and
a
little
below
him
in
the
next
darkness
he
found
the
edge
of
it
and
dragged
himself
up
on
the
mass
of
timbers
the
thunder
had
been
rolling
steadily
westward
and
david
crouched
low
hoping
for
one
more
flash
to
illumine
the
raft
it
came
at
last
from
a
mass
of
inky
cloud
far
to
the
west
so
indistinct
that
it
made
only
dim
shadows
out
of
the
tents
and
shelters
but
it
was
sufficient
to
give
him
direction
before
its
faint
glare
died
out
he
saw
the
deeper
shadow
of
the
cabin
forward
for
many
minutes
he
lay
where
he
had
dragged
himself
without
making
a
movement
in
its
direction
nowhere
about
him
could
he
see
a
sign
of
light
nor
could
he
hear
any
sound
of
life
pierre
people
were
evidently
deep
in
slumber
carrigan
had
no
very
definite
idea
of
the
next
step
in
his
adventure
he
had
swum
from
the
bateau
largely
under
impulse
with
no
preconceived
scheme
of
action
urged
chiefly
by
the
hope
that
he
would
find
pierre
in
the
cabin
and
that
something
might
come
of
it
as
for
knocking
at
the
door
and
rousing
the
chief
of
the
boulains
from
sleep
he
had
at
the
present
moment
no
very
good
excuse
for
that
no
sooner
had
the
thought
and
its
objection
come
to
him
than
a
broad
shaft
of
light
shot
with
startling
suddenness
athwart
the
blackness
of
the
raft
darkened
in
another
instant
by
an
obscuring
shadow
swift
as
the
light
itself
david
eyes
turned
to
the
source
of
the
unexpected
illumination
the
door
of
pierre
cabin
was
wide
open
the
interior
was
flooded
with
lampglow
and
in
the
doorway
stood
pierre
himself
the
chief
of
the
boulains
seemed
to
be
measuring
the
weather
possibilities
of
the
night
his
subdued
voice
reached
david
chuckling
with
satisfaction
as
he
spoke
to
some
one
who
was
behind
him
in
the
cabin
pitch
and
brimstone
but
it
black
he
cried
you
could
carve
it
with
a
knife
and
stand
it
on
end
amante
but
it
going
west
in
a
few
hours
the
stars
will
be
out
he
drew
back
into
the
cabin
and
the
door
closed
david
held
his
breath
in
amazement
staring
at
the
blackness
where
a
moment
before
the
light
had
been
who
was
it
pierre
had
called
sweetheart
amante
he
could
not
have
been
mistaken
the
word
had
come
to
him
clearly
and
there
was
but
one
guess
to
make
was
not
on
the
bateau
she
had
played
him
for
a
fool
had
completely
hoodwinked
him
in
her
plot
with
pierre
they
were
cleverer
than
he
had
supposed
and
in
darkness
she
had
rejoined
her
husband
on
the
raft
but
why
that
senseless
play
of
falsehood
what
could
be
their
object
in
wanting
him
to
believe
she
was
still
aboard
the
bateau
he
stood
up
on
his
feet
and
mopped
the
warm
rain
from
his
face
while
the
gloom
hid
the
grim
smile
that
came
slowly
to
his
lips
close
upon
the
thrill
of
his
astonishment
he
felt
a
new
stir
in
his
blood
which
added
impetus
to
his
determination
and
his
action
he
was
not
disgusted
with
himself
nor
was
he
embittered
by
what
he
had
thought
of
a
moment
ago
as
the
lying
hypocrisy
of
his
captors
to
be
beaten
in
his
game
of
was
sometimes
to
be
expected
and
carrigan
always
gave
proper
credit
to
the
winners
it
was
also
good
medicine
to
know
that
instead
of
being
an
unhappy
and
neglected
wife
had
blinded
him
with
an
exquisitely
clever
simulation
just
why
she
had
done
it
and
why
pierre
had
played
his
masquerade
it
was
his
duty
now
to
find
out
an
hour
ago
he
would
have
cut
off
a
hand
before
spying
upon
pierre
wife
or
eavesdropping
under
her
window
now
he
felt
no
uneasiness
of
conscience
as
he
approached
the
cabin
for
herself
had
destroyed
all
reason
for
any
delicate
discrimination
on
his
part
the
rain
had
almost
stopped
and
in
one
of
the
near
tents
he
heard
a
sleepy
voice
but
he
had
no
fear
of
chance
discovery
the
night
would
remain
dark
for
a
long
time
and
in
his
bare
feet
he
made
no
sound
the
sharpest
ears
of
a
dog
ten
feet
away
might
have
heard
close
to
the
cabin
door
yet
in
such
a
way
that
the
sudden
opening
of
it
would
not
reveal
him
he
paused
and
listened
distinctly
he
heard
pierre
voice
but
not
the
words
a
moment
later
came
the
soft
joyous
laughter
of
a
woman
and
for
an
instant
a
hand
seemed
to
grip
david
heart
filling
it
with
pain
there
was
no
unhappiness
in
that
laughter
it
seemed
instead
to
tremble
in
an
exultation
of
gladness
suddenly
pierre
came
nearer
the
door
and
his
voice
was
more
distinct
i
tell
you
it
is
the
greatest
joke
of
my
life
he
heard
him
say
we
are
safe
if
it
should
come
to
the
worst
we
can
settle
the
matter
in
another
way
i
can
not
but
sing
and
laugh
even
in
the
face
of
it
all
and
she
in
that
very
innocence
which
amuses
me
so
has
no
suspicion
he
turned
and
vainly
david
keyed
his
ears
to
catch
the
final
words
the
voices
in
the
cabin
grew
lower
twice
he
heard
the
soft
laughter
of
the
woman
pierre
voice
when
he
spoke
was
unintelligible
the
thought
that
his
random
adventure
was
bringing
him
to
an
important
discovery
possessed
carrigan
pierre
he
believed
had
been
on
the
very
edge
of
disclosing
something
which
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
surely
in
this
cabin
there
must
be
a
window
and
the
window
would
be
open
quietly
he
felt
his
way
through
the
darkness
to
the
shore
side
of
the
cabin
a
narrow
bar
of
light
at
least
partly
confirmed
his
judgment
there
was
a
window
but
it
was
almost
entirely
curtained
and
it
was
closed
had
the
curtain
been
drawn
two
inches
lower
the
thin
stream
of
light
would
have
been
shut
entirely
out
from
the
night
under
this
window
david
crouched
for
several
minutes
hoping
that
in
the
calm
which
was
succeeding
the
storm
it
might
be
opened
the
voices
were
still
more
indistinct
inside
he
scarcely
heard
pierre
but
twice
again
he
heard
the
low
and
musical
laughter
of
the
woman
she
had
laughed
differently
with
him
and
the
grim
smile
settled
on
his
lips
as
he
looked
up
at
the
narrow
slit
of
light
over
his
head
he
had
an
overwhelming
desire
to
look
in
after
all
it
was
a
matter
of
professional
business
and
his
duty
he
was
glad
the
curtain
was
drawn
so
low
from
experiments
of
his
own
he
knew
there
was
small
chance
of
those
inside
seeing
him
through
the
slit
and
he
raised
himself
boldly
until
his
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
the
aperture
directly
in
the
line
of
his
vision
was
pierre
wife
she
was
seated
and
her
back
was
toward
him
so
he
could
not
see
her
face
she
was
partly
disrobed
and
her
hair
was
streaming
loose
about
her
once
he
remembered
she
had
spoken
of
fiery
lights
that
came
into
her
hair
under
certain
illumination
he
had
seen
them
in
the
sun
but
never
as
they
revealed
themselves
now
in
that
cabin
lamp
glow
he
scarcely
looked
at
pierre
who
was
on
his
feet
looking
down
upon
her
not
until
pierre
reached
out
and
crumpled
the
smothering
mass
of
glowing
tresses
in
his
big
hands
and
laughed
it
was
a
laugh
filled
with
the
unutterable
joy
of
possession
the
woman
rose
to
her
feet
up
through
her
hair
went
her
two
white
bare
arms
encircling
neck
the
giant
drew
her
close
her
slim
form
seemed
to
melt
in
his
and
their
lips
met
and
then
the
woman
threw
back
her
head
laughing
so
that
her
glory
of
hair
fell
straight
down
and
she
was
out
of
reach
of
pierre
lips
they
turned
her
face
fronted
the
window
and
out
in
the
night
carrigan
stifled
a
cry
that
almost
broke
from
his
lips
for
a
flash
he
was
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
her
parted
lips
seemed
smiling
at
him
her
white
throat
and
bosom
were
bared
to
him
he
dropped
down
his
heart
choking
him
as
he
stumbled
through
the
darkness
to
the
edge
of
the
raft
there
with
the
lap
of
the
water
at
his
feet
he
paused
it
was
hard
for
him
to
get
breath
he
stared
through
the
gloom
in
the
direction
of
the
bateau
boulain
the
woman
he
loved
was
there
in
her
little
cabin
alone
on
the
bateau
was
wife
her
heart
crushed
and
in
this
cabin
on
the
raft
forgetful
of
her
degradation
and
her
grief
was
the
vilest
wretch
he
had
ever
known
pierre
boulain
and
with
him
giving
herself
into
his
arms
caressing
him
with
her
lips
and
hair
was
the
sister
of
the
man
he
had
helped
to
hang
carmin
fanchet
xx
the
shock
of
the
amazing
discovery
which
carrigan
had
made
was
as
complete
as
it
was
unexpected
his
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
last
thing
in
the
world
he
might
have
guessed
at
or
anticipated
when
they
beheld
through
the
window
of
pierre
cabin
the
beautiful
face
and
partly
disrobed
figure
of
carmin
fanchet
the
first
effect
of
that
shock
had
been
to
drive
him
away
his
action
had
been
involuntary
almost
without
the
benefit
of
reason
as
if
carmin
had
been
herself
receiving
the
caresses
which
were
rightfully
hers
and
upon
which
it
was
both
insult
and
dishonor
for
him
to
spy
he
realized
now
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
leaving
the
window
too
quickly
but
he
did
not
move
back
through
the
gloom
for
there
was
something
too
revolting
in
what
he
had
seen
and
with
the
revulsion
of
it
a
swift
understanding
of
the
truth
which
made
his
hands
clench
as
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
raft
with
his
feet
and
legs
submerged
in
the
current
of
the
river
the
thing
was
not
uncommon
it
was
the
same
monstrous
story
as
old
as
the
river
itself
but
in
this
instance
it
filled
him
with
a
sickening
sort
of
horror
which
gripped
him
at
first
even
more
than
the
strangeness
of
the
fact
that
carmin
fanchet
was
the
other
woman
his
vision
and
his
soul
were
reaching
out
to
the
bateau
lying
in
darkness
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
where
pierre
wife
was
alone
in
her
unhappiness
his
first
impulse
was
to
fling
himself
in
the
river
and
race
to
her
his
second
to
go
back
to
pierre
even
in
his
nakedness
and
call
him
forth
to
a
reckoning
in
his
profession
of
he
had
never
had
the
misfortune
to
kill
but
he
could
kill
pierre
now
his
fingers
dug
into
the
slippery
wood
of
the
log
under
him
his
blood
ran
hot
and
in
his
eyes
blazed
the
fury
of
an
animal
as
he
stared
into
the
wall
of
gloom
between
him
and
boulain
how
much
did
she
know
that
was
the
first
question
which
pounded
in
his
brain
he
suddenly
recalled
his
reference
to
the
fight
his
apology
to
that
it
should
happen
so
near
to
her
presence
and
he
saw
again
the
queer
little
twist
of
her
mouth
as
she
let
slip
the
hint
that
she
was
not
the
only
one
of
her
sex
who
would
know
of
tomorrow
fight
he
had
not
noticed
the
significance
of
it
then
but
now
it
struck
home
was
surely
aware
of
carmin
fanchet
presence
on
the
raft
but
did
she
know
more
than
that
did
she
know
the
truth
or
was
her
heart
filled
only
with
suspicion
and
fear
aggravated
by
neglect
and
his
haste
to
return
to
the
raft
that
night
again
david
mind
flashed
back
recalling
her
defense
of
carmin
fanchet
when
he
had
first
told
her
his
story
of
the
woman
whose
brother
he
had
brought
to
the
hangman
justice
there
could
be
but
one
conclusion
knew
carmin
fanchet
and
she
also
knew
she
was
on
the
raft
with
pierre
as
cooler
judgment
returned
to
him
carrigan
refused
to
concede
more
than
that
for
any
one
of
a
dozen
reasons
carmin
fanchet
might
be
on
the
raft
going
down
the
river
and
it
was
also
quite
within
reason
that
might
have
some
apprehension
of
a
woman
as
beautiful
as
carmin
and
possibly
intuition
had
begun
to
impinge
upon
her
a
disturbing
fear
of
a
something
that
might
happen
but
until
tonight
he
was
confident
she
had
fought
against
this
suspicion
and
had
overridden
it
even
though
she
knew
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
herself
was
slowly
drifting
down
the
stream
with
her
husband
she
had
betrayed
no
anxiety
to
him
in
the
days
that
had
passed
she
had
waited
eagerly
for
pierre
like
a
bird
she
had
gone
to
him
when
at
last
he
came
and
he
had
seen
her
crushed
close
in
pierre
arms
in
their
meeting
it
was
this
night
with
its
gloom
and
its
storm
that
had
made
the
shadowings
of
her
unrest
a
torturing
reality
for
pierre
had
brought
her
back
to
the
bateau
and
had
played
a
pitiably
weak
part
in
concealing
his
desire
to
return
to
the
raft
so
he
told
himself
did
not
know
the
truth
not
as
he
had
seen
it
through
the
window
of
pierre
cabin
she
had
been
hurt
for
he
had
seen
the
sting
of
it
and
in
that
same
instant
he
had
seen
her
soul
rise
up
and
triumph
he
saw
again
the
sudden
fire
that
came
into
her
eyes
when
pierre
urged
the
necessity
of
his
haste
he
saw
her
slim
body
grow
tense
her
red
lips
curve
in
a
flash
of
pride
and
disdain
and
as
carrigan
thought
of
her
in
that
way
his
muscles
grew
tighter
and
he
cursed
pierre
might
be
hurt
she
might
guess
that
her
husband
eyes
and
thoughts
were
too
frequently
upon
another
face
but
in
the
glory
of
her
womanhood
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
conceive
of
a
crime
such
as
he
had
witnessed
through
the
cabin
window
of
that
he
was
sure
and
then
suddenly
like
a
blinding
sheet
of
lightning
out
of
a
dark
sky
came
back
to
him
all
that
pierre
had
said
about
he
had
pitied
pierre
then
he
had
pitied
this
great
giant
of
a
man
who
was
fighting
gloriously
he
had
thought
in
the
face
of
a
situation
that
would
have
excited
most
men
frankly
pierre
had
told
him
cared
more
for
him
than
she
should
with
equal
frankness
he
had
revealed
his
wife
confessions
to
him
that
she
knew
of
his
love
for
her
of
his
kiss
upon
her
hair
in
the
blackness
carrigan
face
burned
hot
if
he
had
in
him
the
desire
to
kill
pierre
now
might
not
pierre
have
had
an
equally
just
desire
to
kill
him
for
he
had
known
even
as
he
kissed
her
hair
and
as
his
arms
held
her
close
to
his
breast
in
crossing
the
creek
that
she
was
the
wife
of
pierre
and
his
muscles
relaxed
slowly
he
lowered
himself
into
the
cool
wash
of
the
river
and
struck
out
toward
the
bateau
he
did
not
breast
the
current
with
the
same
fierce
determination
with
which
he
had
crossed
through
the
storm
to
the
raft
but
drifted
with
it
and
reached
the
opposite
shore
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
bateau
here
he
waited
for
a
time
while
the
thickness
of
the
clouds
broke
and
a
gray
light
came
through
them
revealing
dimly
the
narrow
path
of
pebbly
wash
along
the
shore
silently
a
stark
naked
shadow
in
the
night
he
came
back
to
the
bateau
and
crawled
through
his
window
he
lighted
a
lamp
and
turned
it
very
low
and
in
the
dim
glow
of
it
rubbed
his
muscles
until
they
burned
he
was
fit
for
tomorrow
and
the
knowledge
of
that
fitness
filled
him
with
a
savage
elation
a
love
of
sport
had
induced
him
to
fling
his
first
challenge
into
the
face
of
concombre
bateese
but
that
sentiment
was
gone
the
approaching
fight
was
no
longer
an
incident
a
foolish
error
into
which
he
had
unwittingly
plunged
himself
in
this
hour
it
was
the
biggest
physical
thing
that
had
ever
loomed
up
in
his
life
and
he
yearned
for
the
dawn
with
the
eagerness
of
a
beast
that
waits
for
the
kill
which
comes
with
the
break
of
day
but
it
was
not
the
face
he
saw
under
the
hammering
of
his
blows
he
could
not
hate
the
he
could
not
even
dislike
him
now
he
forced
himself
to
bed
and
later
he
slept
in
the
dream
that
came
to
him
it
was
not
bateese
who
faced
him
in
battle
but
pierre
boulain
he
awoke
with
that
dream
a
thing
of
fire
in
his
brain
the
sun
was
not
yet
up
but
the
flush
of
it
was
painting
the
east
and
he
dressed
quietly
and
carefully
listening
for
some
sound
of
awakening
beyond
the
bulkhead
if
was
awake
she
was
very
still
there
was
noise
ashore
across
the
river
he
could
hear
the
singing
of
men
and
through
his
window
saw
the
white
smoke
of
early
fires
rising
above
the
it
was
the
indian
who
unlocked
the
door
and
brought
in
his
breakfast
and
it
was
the
indian
who
returned
for
the
dishes
half
an
hour
later
after
that
carrigan
waited
tense
with
the
desire
for
action
to
begin
he
sensed
no
premonition
of
evil
about
to
befall
him
every
nerve
and
sinew
in
his
body
was
alive
for
the
combat
he
thrilled
with
an
overwhelming
confidence
a
conviction
of
his
ability
to
win
an
almost
dangerous
of
approaching
triumph
in
spite
of
the
odds
in
weight
and
brute
strength
which
were
pitted
against
him
a
dozen
times
he
listened
at
the
bulkhead
between
him
and
and
still
he
heard
no
movement
on
the
other
side
it
was
eight
when
one
of
the
bateau
men
appeared
at
the
door
and
asked
if
he
was
ready
quickly
david
joined
him
he
forgot
his
taunts
to
concombre
bateese
forgot
the
softly
padded
gloves
in
his
pack
with
which
he
had
promised
to
pommel
the
into
oblivion
he
was
thinking
only
of
naked
fists
into
a
canoe
he
followed
the
bateau
man
who
turned
his
craft
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
opposite
shore
and
as
they
went
david
was
sure
he
caught
the
slight
movement
of
a
curtain
at
the
little
window
of
forward
cabin
he
smiled
back
and
raised
his
hand
and
at
that
the
curtain
was
drawn
back
entirely
and
he
knew
that
wife
was
watching
him
as
he
went
to
the
fight
the
raft
was
deserted
but
a
little
below
it
on
a
wide
strip
of
beach
made
hard
and
smooth
by
flood
water
had
gathered
a
crowd
of
men
it
seemed
odd
to
david
they
should
remain
so
quiet
when
he
knew
the
natural
instinct
of
the
riverman
was
to
voice
his
emotion
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
he
spoke
of
this
to
the
bateau
man
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
grinned
eet
ees
ze
command
of
pierre
he
explained
pierre
say
no
man
make
beeg
noise
at
what
you
call
heem
funeral
an
theese
to
be
wan
gran
i
see
david
nodded
he
did
not
grin
back
at
the
other
humor
he
was
looking
at
the
crowd
a
giant
figure
had
appeared
out
of
the
center
of
it
and
was
coming
slowly
down
to
the
river
it
was
pierre
scarcely
had
the
prow
of
the
canoe
touched
shore
when
david
leaped
out
and
hurried
to
meet
him
behind
pierre
came
bateese
the
he
was
stripped
to
the
waist
and
naked
from
the
knees
down
his
arms
hung
huge
and
loose
at
his
sides
and
the
muscles
of
his
hulking
body
stood
out
like
carven
mahogany
in
the
glisten
of
the
morning
sun
he
was
like
a
grizzly
a
human
beast
of
monstrous
power
something
to
look
at
to
back
away
from
to
fear
yet
david
scarcely
noticed
him
he
met
pierre
faced
him
and
stopped
and
he
had
gone
swiftly
to
this
meeting
so
that
the
chief
of
the
boulains
was
within
earshot
of
all
his
men
pierre
was
smiling
he
held
out
his
hand
as
he
had
held
it
out
once
before
in
the
bateau
cabin
and
his
big
voice
boomed
out
a
greeting
carrigan
did
not
answer
nor
did
he
look
at
the
extended
hand
for
an
instant
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
and
then
swift
as
lightning
carrigan
arm
shot
out
and
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
he
struck
pierre
a
terrific
blow
squarely
on
the
cheek
the
sound
of
the
blow
was
like
the
smash
of
a
paddle
on
smooth
water
not
a
riverman
but
heard
it
and
as
pierre
staggered
back
flung
almost
from
his
feet
by
its
force
a
subdued
cry
of
amazement
broke
from
the
waiting
men
concombre
bateese
stood
like
one
stupefied
and
then
in
another
flash
pierre
had
caught
himself
and
whirled
like
a
wild
beast
every
muscle
in
his
body
was
drawn
for
a
gigantic
overwhelming
leap
his
eyes
blazed
the
fury
of
a
beast
was
in
his
face
before
all
his
people
he
had
suffered
the
deadliest
insult
that
could
be
offered
a
man
of
the
three
river
country
a
blow
struck
with
the
flat
of
another
hand
anything
else
one
might
forgive
but
not
that
such
a
blow
if
not
avenged
was
a
brand
that
passed
down
into
the
second
and
third
generations
and
even
children
would
call
out
to
the
one
who
was
coward
enough
to
receive
it
without
resentment
a
rumbling
growl
rose
in
the
throat
of
concombre
bateese
in
that
moment
when
it
seemed
as
though
pierre
boulain
was
about
to
kill
the
man
who
had
struck
him
he
saw
the
promise
of
his
own
fight
gone
in
a
flash
for
no
man
in
all
the
northland
could
now
fight
david
carrigan
ahead
of
pierre
david
waited
prepared
to
meet
the
rush
of
a
madman
and
then
for
a
second
time
he
saw
a
mighty
struggle
in
the
soul
of
pierre
the
giant
held
himself
back
the
fury
died
out
of
his
face
but
his
great
hands
remained
clenched
as
he
said
for
david
alone
that
was
a
playful
blow
it
was
a
joke
it
was
for
you
pierre
replied
carrigan
you
are
a
coward
and
a
skunk
i
swam
to
the
raft
last
night
looked
through
your
window
and
saw
what
happened
there
you
are
not
fit
for
a
decent
man
to
fight
yet
i
will
fight
you
if
you
are
not
too
great
a
coward
and
dare
to
let
our
wagers
stand
as
they
were
made
pierre
eyes
widened
and
for
a
breath
or
two
he
stared
at
carrigan
as
if
looking
into
him
and
not
at
him
his
big
hands
relaxed
and
slowly
the
readiness
went
out
of
his
body
those
who
looked
beheld
the
transformation
in
amazement
for
of
all
who
waited
only
pierre
and
the
had
heard
carrigan
words
though
they
had
seen
and
heard
the
blow
of
insult
you
swam
to
the
raft
repeated
pierre
in
a
low
voice
as
if
doubting
what
he
had
heard
you
looked
through
the
window
and
saw
david
nodded
he
could
not
cover
the
sneering
poison
in
his
voice
his
contempt
for
the
man
who
stood
before
him
yes
i
looked
through
the
window
and
i
saw
you
and
the
lowest
woman
on
the
three
rivers
the
sister
of
a
man
i
helped
to
hang
i
stop
pierre
voice
broke
out
of
him
like
the
sudden
crash
of
thunder
he
came
a
step
nearer
his
face
livid
his
eyes
shooting
flame
with
a
mighty
effort
he
controlled
himself
again
and
then
as
if
he
saw
something
which
david
could
not
see
he
tried
to
smile
and
in
that
same
instant
david
caught
a
grin
cutting
a
great
slash
across
the
face
of
concombre
bateese
the
change
that
came
over
pierre
now
was
swift
as
sunlight
coming
out
from
shadowing
cloud
a
rumble
grew
in
his
great
chest
it
broke
in
a
low
note
of
laughter
from
his
lips
and
he
faced
the
bateau
across
the
river
you
are
sorry
for
her
is
that
it
you
would
fight
for
the
cleanest
finest
little
girl
who
ever
lived
your
wife
it
is
funny
said
pierre
as
if
speaking
to
himself
and
still
looking
at
the
bateau
yes
it
is
very
funny
ma
belle
he
has
told
you
he
loves
you
and
he
has
kissed
your
hair
and
held
you
in
his
arms
yet
he
wants
to
fight
me
because
he
thinks
i
am
steeped
in
sin
and
to
make
me
fight
in
place
of
bateese
he
has
called
my
carmin
a
low
woman
so
what
else
can
i
do
i
must
fight
i
must
whip
him
until
he
can
not
walk
and
then
i
will
send
him
back
for
you
to
nurse
cherie
and
for
that
blessing
i
think
he
will
willingly
take
my
punishment
is
it
not
so
he
was
smiling
and
no
longer
excited
when
he
turned
to
david
i
will
fight
you
and
the
wagers
shall
stand
and
in
this
hour
let
us
be
honest
like
men
and
make
confession
you
love
ma
belle
jeanne
is
it
not
so
and
i
i
love
my
carmin
whose
brother
you
hanged
as
i
love
no
other
woman
in
the
world
now
if
you
will
have
it
so
let
us
fight
he
began
stripping
off
his
shirt
and
with
a
bellow
in
his
throat
concombre
bateese
slouched
away
like
a
beaten
gorilla
to
explain
to
pierre
people
the
change
in
the
plan
of
battle
and
as
that
news
spread
like
fire
in
the
there
came
but
a
single
cry
in
response
shrill
and
terrible
and
that
was
from
the
throat
of
andre
the
broken
man
xxi
as
carrigan
stripped
off
his
shirt
he
knew
that
at
least
in
one
way
he
had
met
more
than
his
match
in
pierre
boulain
in
the
splendid
service
of
which
he
was
a
part
he
had
known
many
men
of
iron
and
steel
men
whose
nerve
and
coolness
not
even
death
could
very
greatly
disturb
yet
pierre
he
conceded
was
their
master
and
his
own
for
a
flash
he
had
transformed
the
chief
of
the
boulains
into
a
volcano
which
had
threatened
to
break
in
savage
fury
yet
neither
the
crash
nor
destruction
had
come
and
now
pierre
was
smiling
again
as
carrigan
faced
him
stripped
to
the
waist
he
betrayed
no
sign
of
the
tempest
of
passion
that
had
swept
him
a
few
minutes
before
his
cool
steely
eyes
had
in
them
a
look
that
was
positively
friendly
as
concombre
bateese
marked
in
the
hard
sand
the
line
of
the
circle
within
which
no
man
might
come
and
as
he
did
this
and
pierre
people
crowded
close
about
it
pierre
himself
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
david
it
seems
a
shame
that
we
should
fight
i
like
you
i
have
always
loved
a
man
who
would
fight
to
protect
a
woman
and
i
shall
be
careful
not
to
hurt
you
more
than
is
necessary
to
make
you
see
reason
and
to
win
the
wagers
so
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
killing
you
as
bateese
might
have
done
and
i
promise
not
to
destroy
your
beauty
for
the
sake
of
the
lady
in
the
bateau
my
carmin
if
she
knew
you
spied
through
her
window
last
night
would
say
kill
you
with
as
little
loss
of
time
as
possible
for
as
regards
you
her
sweet
disposition
was
spoiled
when
you
hung
her
brother
yet
to
me
she
is
an
angel
contempt
for
the
man
who
spoke
of
his
wife
and
the
infamous
carmin
fanchet
in
the
same
breath
drew
a
sneer
to
carrigan
lips
he
nodded
toward
the
waiting
circle
of
men
they
are
ready
for
the
show
pierre
you
talk
big
now
let
us
see
if
you
can
fight
for
another
moment
pierre
hesitated
i
am
so
sorry
are
you
ready
st
pierre
it
is
not
fair
and
she
will
never
forgive
me
you
are
no
match
for
me
i
am
half
again
as
heavy
and
as
big
a
coward
as
you
are
a
scoundrel
st
pierre
it
is
like
a
man
fighting
a
boy
yet
it
is
less
dishonorable
than
betraying
the
woman
who
is
your
wife
for
another
who
should
have
been
hanged
along
with
her
brother
st
pierre
boulain
face
darkened
he
drew
back
half
a
dozen
steps
and
cried
out
a
word
to
bateese
instantly
the
circle
of
waiting
men
grew
tense
as
the
jerked
the
big
handkerchief
from
his
head
and
held
it
out
at
arm
length
yet
with
that
eagerness
for
the
fight
there
was
something
else
which
carrigan
was
swift
to
sense
the
attitude
of
the
watchers
was
not
one
of
uncertainty
or
of
very
great
expectation
in
spite
of
the
staring
faces
and
the
muscular
tightening
of
the
line
he
knew
what
was
passing
in
their
minds
and
in
the
low
whispers
from
lip
to
lip
they
were
pitying
him
now
that
he
stood
stripped
with
only
a
few
paces
between
him
and
the
giant
figure
of
pierre
the
unfairness
of
the
fight
struck
home
even
to
concombre
bateese
only
carrigan
himself
knew
how
like
tempered
steel
the
sinews
of
his
body
were
built
but
to
the
eye
in
size
alone
he
stood
like
a
boy
before
pierre
and
pierre
people
their
voices
stilled
by
the
deadly
inequality
of
it
were
waiting
for
a
slaughter
and
not
a
fight
a
smile
came
to
carrigan
lips
as
he
saw
bateese
hesitating
to
drop
the
handkerchief
and
with
the
swiftness
of
the
trained
fighter
he
made
his
first
plan
for
the
battle
before
the
cloth
fell
from
the
fingers
as
the
handkerchief
fluttered
to
the
ground
he
faced
pierre
the
smile
gone
never
smile
when
you
fight
the
greatest
of
all
masters
of
the
ring
had
told
him
never
show
anger
do
betray
any
emotion
at
all
if
you
can
help
it
carrigan
wondered
what
the
old
would
say
could
he
see
him
now
backing
away
slowly
from
pierre
as
the
giant
advanced
upon
him
for
he
knew
his
face
was
betraying
to
pierre
and
his
people
the
deadliest
of
all
sins
anxiety
and
indecision
very
closely
yet
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
shift
uneasily
he
watched
the
effect
of
his
trick
on
boulain
twice
the
huge
riverman
followed
him
about
the
ring
of
sand
and
the
steely
glitter
in
his
eyes
changed
to
laughter
and
the
tense
faces
of
the
men
about
them
relaxed
a
subdued
ripple
of
merriment
rose
where
there
had
been
silence
a
third
time
david
maneuvered
his
retreat
and
his
eyes
shot
furtively
to
concombre
bateese
and
the
men
at
his
back
they
were
grinning
the
mouth
was
wide
open
and
his
grotesque
body
hung
limp
and
astonished
this
was
not
a
fight
it
was
a
comedy
like
a
rooster
following
a
sparrow
around
a
barnyard
and
then
a
still
funnier
thing
happened
for
david
began
to
trot
in
a
circle
around
pierre
dodging
and
feinting
and
keeping
always
at
a
safe
distance
a
howl
of
laughter
came
from
bateese
and
broke
in
a
roar
from
the
men
pierre
stopped
in
his
tracks
a
grin
on
his
face
his
big
arms
and
shoulders
limp
and
unprepared
as
carrigan
dodged
in
close
and
out
again
and
then
a
howl
broke
in
the
middle
of
the
throat
where
there
had
been
laughter
there
came
a
sudden
shutting
off
of
sound
a
great
gasp
as
if
made
by
choking
men
swifter
than
anything
they
had
ever
seen
in
human
action
carrigan
had
leaped
in
they
saw
him
strike
they
heard
the
blow
they
saw
pierre
great
head
rock
back
as
if
struck
from
his
shoulders
by
a
club
and
they
saw
and
heard
another
blow
and
a
third
like
so
many
flashes
of
lightning
and
pierre
went
down
as
if
shot
the
man
they
had
laughed
at
was
no
longer
like
a
hopping
sparrow
he
was
waiting
bent
a
little
forward
every
muscle
in
his
body
ready
for
action
they
watched
for
him
to
leap
upon
his
fallen
enemy
kicking
and
gouging
and
choking
in
the
riverman
way
but
david
waited
and
pierre
staggered
to
his
feet
his
mouth
was
bleeding
and
choked
with
sand
and
a
great
lump
was
beginning
to
swell
over
his
eye
a
deadly
fire
blazed
in
his
face
as
he
rushed
like
a
mad
bull
at
the
insignificant
opponent
who
had
tricked
and
humiliated
him
this
time
carrigan
did
not
retreat
but
held
his
ground
and
a
yell
of
joy
went
up
from
bateese
as
the
mighty
bulk
of
the
giant
descended
upon
his
victim
it
was
an
avalanche
of
crushing
in
its
destructiveness
and
carrigan
seemed
to
reach
for
it
as
it
came
upon
him
then
his
head
went
down
swifter
than
a
diving
grebe
and
as
pierre
arm
swung
like
an
oaken
beam
over
his
shoulder
his
own
shot
in
straight
for
the
pit
of
the
other
stomach
it
was
a
blow
with
the
force
of
a
behind
it
and
the
groan
that
forced
its
way
out
of
pierre
vitals
was
heard
by
every
ear
in
the
cordon
of
watchers
his
weight
stopped
his
arms
opened
and
through
that
opening
carrigan
fist
went
a
second
time
to
the
other
jaw
and
a
second
time
the
great
pierre
boulain
sprawled
out
upon
the
sand
and
there
he
lay
and
made
no
effort
to
rise
concombre
bateese
with
his
great
mouth
agape
stood
for
an
instant
as
if
the
blow
had
stunned
him
in
place
of
his
master
then
suddenly
he
came
to
life
and
leaped
to
david
side
diable

david
did
not
hear
the
rest
the
opportunity
was
too
tempting
he
swung
and
with
a
huge
grunt
the
body
of
concombre
bateese
rolled
over
that
of
the
chief
of
the
boulains
this
time
carrigan
did
not
wait
but
followed
up
so
closely
that
the
had
scarcely
gathered
the
crook
out
of
his
knees
when
another
blow
on
the
jaw
sent
him
into
the
sand
again
three
times
he
tried
the
experiment
of
regaining
his
feet
and
three
times
he
was
knocked
down
after
the
last
blow
he
raised
himself
groggily
to
a
sitting
posture
and
there
he
remained
blinking
like
a
stunned
pig
with
his
big
hands
clutching
in
the
sand
he
stared
up
unseeingly
at
carrigan
who
waited
over
him
and
then
stupidly
at
the
transfixed
cordon
of
men
whose
eyes
were
bulging
and
who
were
holding
their
breath
in
the
astonishment
of
this
miracle
which
had
descended
upon
them
they
heard
bateese
muttering
something
incoherent
as
his
head
wobbled
and
pierre
himself
seemed
to
hear
it
for
he
stirred
and
raised
himself
slowly
until
he
also
was
sitting
in
the
sand
staring
at
bateese
carrigan
picked
up
his
shirt
and
the
riverman
who
had
brought
him
from
the
bateau
returned
with
him
to
the
canoe
there
was
no
demonstration
behind
them
to
david
himself
the
whole
thing
had
been
an
amazing
surprise
and
he
was
not
at
all
reluctant
to
leave
as
quickly
as
his
dignity
would
permit
before
some
other
of
pierre
people
offered
to
put
a
further
test
upon
his
prowess
he
wanted
to
laugh
he
wanted
to
thank
god
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
the
absurd
run
of
luck
that
had
made
his
triumph
not
only
easy
but
utterly
complete
he
had
expected
to
win
but
he
had
also
expected
a
terrific
fight
before
the
last
blow
was
struck
and
there
had
been
no
fight
he
was
returning
to
the
bateau
without
a
scratch
his
hair
scarcely
ruffled
and
he
had
defeated
not
only
pierre
but
the
giant
as
well
it
was
inconceivable
and
yet
it
had
happened
a
veritable
burlesque
an
affair
that
might
turn
quickly
into
a
tragedy
if
either
pierre
or
concombre
bateese
guessed
the
truth
of
it
for
in
that
event
he
might
have
to
face
them
again
with
the
god
of
luck
playing
fairly
and
he
was
honest
enough
with
himself
to
confess
that
the
idea
no
longer
held
either
thrill
or
desire
for
him
now
that
he
had
seen
both
pierre
and
bateese
stripped
for
battle
he
had
no
further
appetite
for
fistic
discussion
with
them
after
all
there
was
a
merit
in
caution
and
he
had
several
lucky
stars
to
bless
just
at
the
present
moment
inwardly
he
was
a
bit
suspicious
of
the
ultimate
ending
of
the
affair
pierre
had
almost
no
cause
for
complaint
for
it
was
his
own
carelessness
coupled
with
his
opponent
luck
that
had
been
his
undoing
and
luck
and
carelessness
are
legitimate
factors
of
every
fight
carrigan
told
himself
but
with
bateese
it
was
different
he
had
held
up
his
big
jaw
uncovered
and
tempting
entreating
some
one
to
hit
him
and
carrigan
had
yielded
to
that
temptation
the
blow
would
have
stunned
an
ox
three
others
like
it
had
left
the
huge
sitting
in
the
sand
and
no
one
of
those
three
blows
were
exactly
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
they
had
been
mightily
efficacious
but
the
might
demand
a
rehearing
when
he
came
fully
into
his
senses
not
until
they
were
to
the
bateau
did
carrigan
dare
to
glance
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
man
who
was
paddling
to
see
what
effect
the
fistic
travesty
had
left
on
him
he
was
a
fellow
and
he
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
well
what
did
you
think
of
it
comrade
the
other
gave
his
shoulders
a
joyous
shrug
mon

longer
suddenly
an
inspiration
hit
him
joe

his

dug
deeper
into
the
water
and
david
heart
felt
lighter
if
joe
was
an
average
barometer
and
he
was
a
husky
and
chap
it
was
probable
that
neither
pierre
nor
bateese
would
demand
another
chance
at
him
and
pierre
would
pay
his
wager
he
could
see
no
one
aboard
the
bateau
when
he
climbed
from
the
canoe
looking
back
he
saw
that
two
other
canoes
had
started
from
the
opposite
shore
then
he
went
to
his
cabin
door
opened
it
and
entered
scarcely
had
the
door
closed
behind
him
when
he
stopped
staring
toward
the
window
that
opened
on
the
river
standing
full
in
the
morning
glow
of
it
was
boulain
she
was
facing
him
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
red
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
were
aglow
with
a
fire
which
she
made
no
effort
to
hide
from
him
in
her
hand
she
still
held
the
binoculars
he
had
left
on
the
cabin
table
he
guessed
the
truth
through
the
glasses
she
had
watched
the
whole
miserable
fiasco
he
felt
creeping
over
him
a
sickening
shame
and
his
eyes
fell
slowly
from
her
to
the
table
what
he
saw
there
caught
his
breath
in
the
middle
it
was
the
entire
surgical
outfit
of
nepapinas
the
old
indian
doctor
and
there
were
basins
of
water
and
white
strips
of
linen
ready
for
use
and
a
pile
of
medicated
cotton
and
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
that
one
might
apply
to
ease
the
agonies
of
a
dying
man
and
beyond
the
table
huddled
in
so
small
a
heap
that
he
was
almost
hidden
by
it
was
nepapinas
himself
disappointment
writ
in
his
face
as
his
beady
eyes
rested
on
david
the
evidence
could
not
be
mistaken
they
had
expected
him
to
come
back
more
nearly
dead
than
alive
and
pierre
wife
had
prepared
for
the
thing
she
had
thought
inevitable
even
his
bed
was
nicely
turned
down
its
fresh
white
sheets
inviting
an
occupant
and
david
looking
at
pierre
wife
again
felt
his
heart
beating
hard
in
his
breast
at
the
look
which
was
in
her
eyes
it
was
not
the
scintillation
of
laughter
and
the
flame
in
her
cheeks
was
not
embarrassment
she
was
not
amused
the
ludicrousness
of
her
mislaid
plans
had
not
struck
her
as
they
had
struck
him
she
had
placed
the
binoculars
on
the
table
and
slowly
she
came
to
him
her
hands
reached
out
and
her
fingers
rested
like
the
touch
of
velvet
on
his
arms
it
was
splendid
she
said
softly
it
was
splendid
she
was
very
near
her
breast
almost
touching
him
her
hands
creeping
up
until
the
tips
of
her
fingers
rested
on
his
shoulders
her
scarlet
mouth
so
close
he
could
feel
the
soft
breath
of
it
in
his
face
it
was
splendid
she
whispered
again
and
then
suddenly
she
rose
up
on
her
tiptoes
and
kissed
him
so
swiftly
was
it
done
that
she
was
gone
before
he
sensed
that
wild
touch
of
her
lips
against
his
own
like
a
swallow
she
was
at
the
door
and
the
door
opened
and
closed
behind
her
and
for
a
moment
he
heard
the
quick
running
of
her
feet
then
he
looked
at
the
old
indian
and
the
indian
too
was
staring
at
the
door
through
which
pierre
wife
had
flown
xxii
for
many
seconds
that
seemed
like
minutes
david
stood
where
she
had
left
him
while
nepapinas
rose
gruntingly
to
his
feet
and
gathered
up
his
belongings
and
hobbled
sullenly
to
the
bateau
door
and
out
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
the
indian
movement
for
his
soul
was
aflame
with
a
fire
deliberately
with
that
ravishing
glory
of
something
in
her
eyes
pierre
wife
had
kissed
him
on
her
tiptoes
her
cheeks
like
crimson
flowers
she
had
given
her
still
redder
lips
to
him
and
his
own
lips
burned
and
his
heart
pounded
hard
and
he
stared
for
a
time
like
one
struck
dumb
at
the
spot
where
she
had
stood
by
the
window
then
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
door
and
flung
it
wide
open
and
on
his
lips
was
the
reckless
cry
of
name
but
pierre
wife
was
gone
and
nepapinas
was
gone
and
at
the
tail
of
the
big
sweep
sat
only
joe
clamart
guarding
watchfully
the
two
canoes
were
drawing
near
and
in
one
of
them
were
two
men
and
in
the
other
three
and
david
knew
that
like
joe
clamart
they
were
watchers
set
over
him
by
pierre
then
a
fourth
canoe
left
the
far
shore
and
when
it
had
reached
he
recognized
the
figure
in
the
stern
as
that
of
andre
the
broken
man
the
other
he
thought
must
be
pierre
he
went
back
into
the
cabin
and
stood
where
had
stood
at
the
window
nepapinas
had
not
taken
away
the
basins
of
water
and
the
bandages
were
still
there
and
the
pile
of
medicated
cotton
and
the
suspiciously
bed
after
all
he
was
losing
something
by
not
occupying
the
bed
and
yet
if
pierre
or
bateese
had
messed
him
up
badly
and
a
couple
of
fellows
had
lugged
him
in
between
them
it
was
probable
that
would
not
have
kissed
him
and
that
kiss
of
pierre
wife
would
remain
with
him
until
the
day
he
died
he
was
thinking
of
it
the
swift
warm
thrill
of
her
velvety
lips
red
as
strawberries
and
twice
as
sweet
when
the
door
opened
and
pierre
came
in
the
sight
of
him
in
this
richest
moment
of
his
life
gave
david
no
sense
of
humiliation
or
shame
between
him
and
pierre
rose
swiftly
what
he
had
seen
last
night
carmin
fanchet
in
all
the
lure
of
her
disheveled
beauty
crushed
close
in
the
arms
of
the
man
whose
wife
only
a
moment
before
had
pressed
her
lips
close
to
his
and
as
the
eyes
of
the
two
met
there
came
over
him
a
desire
to
tell
the
other
what
had
happened
that
he
might
see
him
writhe
with
the
sting
of
the
thing
with
which
he
was
playing
then
he
saw
that
even
that
would
not
hurt
pierre
for
the
chief
of
the
boulains
standing
there
with
the
big
lump
over
his
eye
had
caught
sight
of
the
things
on
the
table
and
the
nicely
turned
down
bed
and
his
one
good
eye
lit
up
with
sudden
laughter
and
his
white
teeth
flashed
in
an
understanding
smile
tonnerre
i
said
she
would
nurse
you
with
gentle
hands
he
rumbled
see
what
you
have
missed
carrigan
i
received
something
which
i
shall
remember
longer
than
a
fine
nursing
retorted
david
and
yet
right
now
i
have
a
greater
interest
in
knowing
what
you
think
of
the
fight
pierre
and
if
you
have
come
to
pay
your
wager
pierre
was
chuckling
mysteriously
in
his
throat
it
was
splendid
splendid
he
said
repeating
words
and
joe
clamart
says
she
ran
out
blushing
like
a
red
rose
in
august
and
that
she
said
no
word
but
flew
like
a
bird
into
the
ashore
she
was
dismayed
because
i
beat
you
st
pierre
non
non
she
was
like
a
lark
filled
with
joy
suddenly
his
eyes
rested
on
the
binoculars
david
nodded
yes
she
saw
it
all
through
the
glasses
pierre
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
heaved
out
a
groan
as
he
took
one
of
the
bandage
strips
between
his
fingers
she
saw
my
disgrace
and
she
did
wait
to
bandage
me
up
did
she
perhaps
she
thought
carmin
fanchet
would
do
that
st
pierre
and
i
am
ashamed
to
go
to
carmin
with
this
great
lump
over
my
eye
and
on
top
of
that
disgrace
you
insist
that
i
pay
the
wager
i
do
pierre
face
hardened
oui
i
am
to
pay
i
am
to
tell
you
all
i
know
about
that
bete
noir
black
roger
audemard
is
it
not
so
that
is
the
wager
but
after
i
have
told
you
what
then
do
you
recall
that
i
gave
you
any
other
guarantee
carrigan
did
i
say
i
would
let
you
go
did
i
promise
i
would
not
kill
you
and
sink
your
body
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
if
i
did
i
can
not
remember
are
you
a
beast
pierre
a
murderer
as
well
as
stop
do
not
tell
me
again
what
you
saw
through
the
window
for
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
am
not
a
beast
but
a
man
had
i
been
a
beast
i
should
have
killed
you
the
first
day
i
saw
you
in
this
cabin
i
am
not
threatening
to
kill
you
and
yet
it
may
be
necessary
if
you
insist
that
i
pay
the
wager
you
understand
to
refuse
to
pay
a
wager
is
a
greater
crime
among
my
people
than
the
killing
of
a
man
if
there
is
a
good
reason
for
the
killing
i
am
helpless
i
must
pay
if
you
insist
before
i
pay
it
is
fair
that
i
give
you
warning
you
mean
i
mean
nothing
as
yet
i
can
not
say
what
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
do
after
you
have
heard
what
i
know
about
roger
audemard
i
am
quite
settled
on
a
plan
just
now
but
the
plan
might
change
at
any
moment
i
am
only
warning
you
that
it
is
a
great
hazard
and
that
you
are
playing
with
a
fire
of
which
you
know
nothing
because
it
has
not
burned
you
yet
carrigan
seated
himself
slowly
in
a
chair
opposite
pierre
with
the
table
between
them
you
are
wasting
time
in
attempting
to
frighten
me
he
said
i
shall
insist
on
the
payment
of
the
wager
st
pierre
for
a
moment
pierre
was
clearly
troubled
then
his
lips
tightened
and
he
smiled
grimly
over
the
table
at
david
i
am
sorry
david
i
like
you
you
are
a
fighting
man
and
no
coward
and
i
should
like
to
travel
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
you
in
many
things
and
such
a
thing
might
be
for
you
do
not
understand
i
tell
you
it
would
have
been
many
times
better
for
you
had
i
whipped
you
out
there
and
it
had
been
you
and
not
me
to
pay
the
wager
it
is
roger
audemard
i
am
interested
in
pierre
why
do
you
hesitate
i
hesitate
i
am
not
hesitating
i
am
giving
you
a
chance
he
leaned
forward
his
great
arms
bent
on
the
table
and
you
insist
david
yes
i
insist
slowly
the
fingers
of
pierre
hands
closed
into
knotted
fists
and
he
said
in
a
low
voice
then
i
will
pay
am
roger
audemard
xxiii
the
astounding
statement
of
the
man
who
sat
opposite
him
held
david
speechless
he
had
guessed
at
some
mysterious
relationship
between
pierre
and
the
criminal
he
was
after
but
not
this
and
roger
audemard
with
his
hands
unclenching
and
a
slow
humor
beginning
to
play
about
his
mouth
waited
coolly
for
him
to
recover
from
his
amazement
in
those
moments
when
his
heart
seemed
to
have
stopped
beating
carrigan
was
staring
at
the
other
but
his
mind
had
shot
beyond
him
to
the
woman
who
was
his
wife
audemard
the
wife
of
black
roger
he
wanted
to
cry
out
against
the
possibility
of
such
a
fact
yet
he
sat
like
one
struck
dumb
as
the
monstrous
truth
took
possession
of
his
brain
and
a
whirlwind
of
understanding
swept
upon
him
he
was
thinking
quickly
and
with
a
terrific
lack
of
sentiment
now
opposite
him
sat
black
roger
the
wholesale
murderer
was
his
wife
carmin
fanchet
sister
of
a
murderer
was
simply
one
of
his
kind
and
bateese
the
and
the
broken
man
and
all
the
pack
about
them
were
of
black
roger
breed
and
kind
love
for
a
woman
had
blinded
him
to
the
facts
which
crowded
upon
him
now
like
a
lamb
he
had
fallen
among
wolves
and
he
had
tried
to
believe
in
them
no
wonder
bateese
and
the
man
he
had
known
as
pierre
had
betrayed
such
merriment
at
times
a
fighting
coolness
possessed
him
as
he
spoke
to
black
roger
i
will
admit
this
is
a
surprise
and
yet
you
have
cleared
up
a
number
of
things
very
quickly
it
proves
to
me
again
that
comedy
is
not
very
far
removed
from
tragedy
at
times
i
am
glad
you
see
the
humor
of
it
david
black
roger
was
smiling
as
pleasantly
as
his
swollen
eye
would
permit
we
must
not
be
too
serious
when
we
die
if
i
were
to
die
i
would
sing
as
the
rope
choked
me
just
to
show
the
world
one
need
not
be
unhappy
because
his
life
is
coming
to
an
end
i
suppose
you
understand
that
ultimately
i
am
going
to
give
you
that
opportunity
said
david
almost
eagerly
black
roger
leaned
toward
him
over
the
table
you
believe
you
are
going
to
hang
me
i
am
sure
of
it
and
you
are
willing
to
wager
the
point
david
it
is
impossible
to
gamble
with
a
condemned
man
black
roger
chuckled
rubbing
his
big
hands
together
until
they
made
a
rasping
sound
and
his
one
good
eye
glowed
at
carrigan
then
i
will
make
a
wager
with
myself
david
ma
foi
i
swear
that
before
the
leaves
fall
from
the
trees
you
will
be
pleading
for
the
friendship
of
black
roger
audemard
and
you
will
be
as
much
in
love
with
carmin
fanchet
as
i
am
and
as
for
he
thrust
back
his
chair
and
rose
to
his
feet
the
old
note
of
subdued
laughter
rumbling
in
his
chest
and
because
i
make
this
wager
with
myself
i
can
not
kill
you
david
though
that
might
be
the
best
thing
to
do
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
chateau
boulain
which
is
in
the
forests
of
the
yellowknife
beyond
the
great
slave
nothing
will
happen
to
you
if
you
make
no
effort
to
escape
if
you
do
that
you
will
surely
die
and
that
would
hurt
me
david
because
i
love
you
like
a
brother
and
in
the
end
i
know
you
are
going
to
grip
the
hand
of
black
roger
audemard
and
get
down
on
your
knees
to
carmin
fanchet
and
as
for
again
he
interrupted
himself
and
went
out
of
the
cabin
laughing
and
there
was
no
mistake
in
the
metallic
click
of
the
lock
outside
the
door
for
a
time
david
did
not
move
from
his
seat
near
the
table
he
had
not
let
roger
audemard
see
how
completely
the
confession
had
upset
his
inner
balance
but
he
made
no
pretense
of
concealing
the
thing
from
himself
now
he
was
in
the
power
of
a
who
in
turn
had
an
army
of
at
his
back
and
both
and
carmin
fanchet
were
a
part
of
this
ring
and
he
was
not
only
a
prisoner
it
was
probable
under
the
circumstances
that
black
roger
would
make
an
end
of
him
when
a
convenient
moment
came
it
was
even
more
than
a
probability
it
was
a
grim
necessity
to
let
him
live
and
escape
would
be
fatal
to
black
roger
from
back
of
these
convictions
riding
over
them
as
if
to
demoralize
any
coherence
and
logic
that
might
go
with
the
evidence
he
was
building
up
came
question
after
question
pounding
at
him
one
after
the
other
until
his
mind
became
more
than
ever
a
whirling
chaos
of
uncertainty
if
pierre
was
black
roger
why
would
he
confess
to
that
fact
simply
to
pay
a
wager
what
reason
could
he
have
for
letting
him
live
at
all
why
had
not
bateese
killed
him
why
had
nursed
him
back
to
life
his
mind
shot
to
the
white
strip
of
sand
in
which
he
had
nearly
died
that
at
least
was
convincing
learning
in
some
way
that
he
was
after
black
roger
they
had
attempted
to
do
away
with
him
there
but
if
that
were
so
why
was
it
bateese
and
black
roger
wife
and
the
indian
nepapinas
had
risked
so
much
to
make
him
live
when
if
they
had
left
him
where
he
had
fallen
he
would
have
died
and
caused
them
no
trouble
there
was
something
exasperatingly
uncertain
and
illogical
about
it
all
was
it
possible
that
pierre
boulain
was
playing
a
huge
joke
on
him
even
that
was
inconceivable
for
there
was
carmin
fanchet
a
fitting
companion
for
a
man
like
black
roger
and
there
was
who
if
it
had
been
a
joke
would
not
have
played
her
part
so
well
suddenly
his
mind
was
filled
only
with
her
had
she
been
his
friend
using
all
her
influence
to
protect
him
because
her
heart
was
sick
of
the
environment
of
which
she
was
a
part
his
own
heart
jumped
at
the
thought
it
was
easy
to
believe
in
he
had
faith
and
that
faith
refused
to
be
destroyed
but
persisted
even
clearer
and
stronger
as
he
thought
again
of
carmin
fanchet
and
black
roger
in
his
heart
grew
the
conviction
it
was
sacrilege
to
believe
the
kiss
she
had
given
him
that
morning
was
a
lie
it
was
something
else
a
spontaneous
gladness
a
joyous
exultation
that
he
had
returned
unharmed
a
thing
unplanned
in
the
soul
of
the
woman
leaping
from
her
before
she
could
stop
it
then
had
come
shame
and
she
had
run
away
from
him
so
swiftly
he
had
not
seen
her
face
again
after
the
touch
of
her
lips
if
it
had
been
a
subterfuge
a
lie
she
would
not
have
done
that
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
paced
restlessly
back
and
forth
as
he
tried
to
bring
together
a
few
tangled
bits
of
the
puzzle
he
heard
voices
outside
and
very
soon
felt
the
movement
of
the
bateau
under
his
feet
and
through
one
of
the
shoreward
windows
he
saw
trees
and
sandy
beach
slowly
drifting
away
on
that
shore
as
far
as
his
eyes
could
travel
up
and
down
he
saw
no
sign
of
but
there
remained
a
canoe
and
near
the
canoe
stood
black
roger
audemard
and
beyond
him
huddled
like
a
charred
stump
in
the
sand
was
andre
the
broken
man
on
the
opposite
shore
the
raft
was
getting
under
way
during
the
next
several
things
happened
which
told
him
there
was
no
longer
a
to
his
imprisonment
on
each
side
of
the
bateau
two
men
worked
at
his
windows
and
when
they
had
finished
no
one
of
them
could
be
opened
more
than
a
few
inches
then
came
the
rattle
of
the
lock
at
the
door
the
grating
of
a
key
and
somewhat
to
carrigan
surprise
it
was
bateese
who
came
in
the
bore
no
facial
evidence
of
the
paralyzing
blows
which
had
knocked
him
out
a
short
time
before
his
jaw
on
which
they
had
landed
was
as
aggressive
as
ever
yet
in
his
face
and
his
attitude
as
he
stared
curiously
at
carrigan
there
was
no
sign
of
resentment
or
unfriendliness
nor
did
he
seem
to
be
ashamed
he
merely
stared
with
the
curious
and
rather
puzzled
eyes
of
a
small
boy
gazing
at
an
inexplicable
oddity
carrigan
standing
before
him
knew
what
was
passing
in
the
other
mind
and
the
humor
of
it
brought
a
smile
to
his
lips
instantly
concombre
face
split
into
a
wide
grin
mon
dieu
if

his
voice
had
risen
and
suddenly
there
came
a
laugh
from
outside
the
door
and
concombre
cut
himself
short
and
his
mouth
closed
with
a
snap
it
was

roger
audemard
black
roger
the
man
i
thought
was
pierre
boulain
carrigan
said
no
more
what
he
had
started
to
say
was
unimportant
compared
with
the
effect
of
roger
audernard
name
on
concombre
bateese
a
deadly
light
glittered
in
the
eyes
and
for
the
first
time
david
realized
that
in
the
grotesque
head
of
the
riverman
was
a
brain
quick
to
grip
at
the
significance
of
things
the
fact
was
evident
that
black
roger
had
not
confided
in
bateese
as
to
the
price
of
the
wager
and
the
confession
of
his
identity
and
for
a
moment
after
the
repetition
of
audemard
name
came
from
david
lips
the
stood
as
if
something
had
stunned
him
then
slowly
as
if
forcing
the
words
in
the
face
of
a
terrific
desire
that
had
transformed
his
body
into
a
hulk
of
quivering
steel
he
said
i
come
with
message
from
pierre
you
see

outside

she
locked
on
bot
sides

you
zat
ees
all
we
shoot
we
five
mans
on
ze

all
ze

toute
la
nuit
you
unnerstan
he
turned
sullenly
waiting
for
no
reply
and
the
door
opened
and
closed
after
him
and
again
came
the
snap
of
the
lock
outside
steadily
the
bateau
swept
down
the
big
river
that
day
there
was
no
in
the
steady
creaking
of
the
long
sweep
even
in
the
swifter
currents
david
could
hear
the
working
of
it
and
he
knew
he
had
seen
the
last
of
the
more
slowly
moving
raft
near
one
of
the
partly
open
windows
he
heard
two
men
talking
just
before
the
bateau
shot
into
the
brule
point
rapids
they
were
strange
voices
he
learned
that
audemard
huge
raft
was
made
up
of
cribs
seven
abreast
and
that
nine
times
between
the
point
brule
and
the
yellowknife
the
raft
would
be
split
up
so
that
each
crib
could
be
run
through
dangerous
rapids
by
itself
that
would
be
a
big
job
david
assured
himself
it
would
be
slow
work
as
well
as
hazardous
and
as
his
own
life
was
in
no
immediate
jeopardy
he
would
have
ample
time
in
which
to
formulate
some
plan
of
action
for
himself
at
the
present
moment
it
seemed
the
one
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
wait
and
behave
himself
according
to
the
instructions
there
was
when
he
came
to
think
about
it
a
saving
element
of
humor
about
it
all
he
had
always
wanted
to
make
a
trip
down
the
three
rivers
in
a
bateau
and
now
he
was
making
it
at
noon
a
guard
brought
in
his
dinner
he
could
not
recall
that
he
had
ever
seen
this
man
before
a
tall
lithe
fellow
built
to
run
like
a
hound
and
who
wore
a
knife
at
his
belt
as
the
door
opened
david
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
others
they
were
looking
individuals
with
muscles
built
for
work
or
fight
one
sitting
on
the
bateau
deck
with
a
rifle
over
his
knees
and
the
other
standing
with
a
rifle
in
his
hand
the
man
who
brought
his
dinner
wasted
no
time
or
words
he
merely
nodded
murmured
a
curt
bonjour
and
went
out
and
carrigan
as
he
began
to
eat
did
not
have
to
tell
himself
twice
that
audemard
had
been
particular
in
his
selection
of
the
bateau
crew
and
that
the
eyes
of
the
men
he
had
seen
could
be
as
keen
as
a
hawk
when
leveled
over
the
tip
of
a
rifle
barrel
they
meant
business
and
he
felt
no
desire
to
smile
in
the
face
of
them
as
he
had
smiled
at
concombre
bateese
it
was
another
man
and
a
stranger
who
brought
in
his
supper
and
for
two
hours
after
that
until
the
sun
went
down
and
gloom
began
to
fall
the
bateau
sped
down
the
river
it
had
made
forty
miles
that
day
he
figured
it
was
still
light
when
the
bateau
was
run
ashore
and
tied
up
but
tonight
there
were
no
singing
voices
or
wild
laughter
of
men
whose
hours
of
and
rest
had
come
to
carrigan
looking
through
his
window
there
was
an
oppressive
menace
about
it
all
the
shadowy
figures
ashore
were
more
like
a
than
a
guard
and
to
dispel
the
gloom
of
it
he
lighted
two
of
the
lamps
in
the
cabin
whistled
drummed
a
simple
chord
he
knew
on
the
piano
and
finally
settled
down
to
smoking
his
pipe
he
would
have
welcomed
the
company
of
bateese
or
joe
clamart
or
one
of
the
guards
and
as
his
loneliness
grew
upon
him
there
was
something
of
companionship
even
in
the
subdued
voices
he
heard
occasionally
outside
he
tried
to
read
but
the
printed
words
jumbled
themselves
and
meant
nothing
it
was
ten
and
clouds
had
darkened
the
night
when
through
his
open
windows
he
heard
a
shout
coming
from
the
river
twice
it
came
before
it
was
answered
from
the
bateau
and
the
second
time
carrigan
recognized
it
as
the
voice
of
roger
audemard
a
brief
interval
passed
between
that
and
the
scraping
of
a
canoe
alongside
and
then
there
was
a
low
conversation
in
which
even
audemard
great
voice
was
subdued
and
after
that
the
grating
of
a
key
in
the
lock
and
the
opening
of
the
door
and
black
roger
came
in
bearing
an
indian
reed
basket
under
his
arm
carrigan
did
not
rise
to
meet
him
it
was
not
like
the
coming
of
the
old
pierre
and
on
black
roger
lips
there
was
no
twist
of
a
smile
nor
in
his
eyes
the
flash
of
greeting
his
face
was
darkly
stern
as
if
he
had
traveled
far
and
hard
on
an
unpleasant
mission
but
in
it
there
was
no
shadow
of
menace
as
there
had
been
in
that
of
concombre
bateese
it
was
rather
the
face
of
a
tired
man
and
yet
david
knew
what
he
saw
was
not
physical
exhaustion
black
roger
guessed
something
of
his
thought
and
his
mouth
for
an
instant
repressed
a
smile
yes
i
have
been
having
a
rough
time
he
nodded
this
is
for
you
he
placed
the
basket
on
the
table
it
held
half
a
bushel
and
was
filled
to
the
curve
of
the
handle
what
lay
in
it
was
hidden
under
a
cloth
securely
tied
about
it
and
you
are
responsible
he
added
stretching
himself
in
a
chair
with
a
gesture
of
weariness
i
should
kill
you
carrigan
and
instead
of
that
i
bring
you
good
things
to
eat
half
the
day
she
has
been
fussing
with
the
things
in
the
basket
and
then
insisted
that
i
bring
them
to
you
and
i
have
brought
them
simply
to
tell
you
another
thing
i
am
sorry
for
her
i
think
carrigan
you
will
find
as
many
tears
in
the
basket
as
anything
else
for
her
heart
is
crushed
and
sick
because
of
the
humiliation
she
brought
upon
herself
this
morning
he
was
twisting
his
big
rough
hands
and
david
own
heart
went
sick
as
he
saw
the
furrowed
lines
that
had
deepened
in
the
other
face
black
roger
did
not
look
at
him
as
he
went
on
of
course
she
told
me
she
tells
me
everything
and
if
she
knew
i
was
telling
you
this
i
think
she
would
kill
herself
but
i
want
you
to
understand
she
is
not
what
you
might
think
she
is
that
kiss
came
from
the
lips
of
the
best
woman
god
ever
made
carrigan
david
with
the
blood
in
him
running
like
fire
heard
himself
answering
i
know
it
she
was
excited
glad
you
had
not
stained
your
hands
with
my
life
this
time
audemard
smiled
but
it
was
the
smile
of
a
man
ten
years
older
than
he
had
appeared
yesterday
do
try
to
answer
i
only
want
you
to
know
she
is
as
pure
as
the
stars
it
was
unfortunate
but
to
follow
the
impulse
of
one
heart
can
not
be
a
sin
everything
has
been
unfortunate
since
you
came
but
i
blame
no
one
except
carmin
fanchet
audemard
nodded
yes
i
have
sent
her
away
is
in
the
cabin
on
the
raft
now
but
even
carmin
i
can
not
blame
very
greatly
for
it
is
impossible
to
hold
anything
against
one
you
love
tell
me
if
i
am
right
you
must
know
you
love
my
do
you
hold
anything
against
her
it
is
unfair
protested
david
she
is
your
wife
audemard
is
it
possible
you
do
love
her
yes
i
love
her
and
carmin
fanchet
i
love
her
too
they
are
so
different
yet
i
love
them
both
is
it
not
possible
for
a
big
heart
like
mine
to
do
that
with
almost
a
snort
david
rose
to
his
feet
and
stared
through
one
of
the
windows
into
the
darkness
of
the
river
black
roger
he
said
without
turning
his
head
the
evidence
at
headquarters
condemns
you
as
one
of
the
murderers
that
ever
lived
but
that
crime
to
me
is
less
atrocious
than
the
one
you
are
committing
against
your
own
wife
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
i
love
her
because
to
deny
it
would
be
a
lie
i
love
her
so
much
that
i
would
sacrifice
myself
soul
and
body
if
that
sacrifice
could
give
you
back
to
her
clean
and
undefiled
and
with
your
hand
unstained
by
the
crime
for
which
you
must
hang
he
did
not
hear
roger
audemard
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
for
a
moment
the
riverman
stared
at
the
back
of
david
head
and
in
that
moment
he
was
fighting
to
keep
back
what
wanted
to
come
from
his
lips
in
words
he
turned
before
david
faced
him
again
and
did
not
pause
until
he
stood
at
the
cabin
door
with
his
hand
at
the
latch
there
he
was
partly
in
shadow
i
shall
not
see
you
again
until
you
reach
the
yellowknife
he
said
not
until
then
will
you
know
or
will
i
know
what
is
going
to
happen
i
think
you
will
understand
strange
things
then
but
that
is
for
the
hour
to
tell
bateese
has
explained
to
you
that
you
must
not
make
an
effort
to
escape
you
would
regret
it
and
so
would
i
if
you
have
red
blood
in
you
if
you
would
understand
all
that
you
can
not
understand
now
wait
as
patiently
as
you
can
bonne
nuit
carrigan
good
night
nodded
david
in
the
pale
shadows
he
thought
a
mysterious
light
of
gladness
illumined
black
roger
face
before
the
door
opened
and
closed
leaving
him
alone
again
xxiv
with
the
going
of
black
roger
also
went
the
oppressive
loneliness
which
had
gripped
carrigan
and
as
he
stood
listening
to
the
low
voices
outside
the
undeniable
truth
came
to
him
that
he
did
not
hate
this
man
as
he
wanted
to
hate
him
he
was
a
murderer
and
a
scoundrel
in
another
way
but
he
felt
irresistibly
the
impulse
to
like
him
and
to
feel
sorry
for
him
he
made
an
effort
to
shake
off
the
feeling
but
a
small
voice
which
he
could
not
quiet
persisted
in
telling
him
that
more
than
one
good
man
had
committed
what
the
law
called
murder
and
that
perhaps
he
did
fully
understand
what
he
had
seen
through
the
cabin
window
on
the
raft
and
yet
when
unstirred
by
this
impulse
he
knew
the
evidence
was
damning
but
his
loneliness
was
gone
with
audemard
visit
had
come
an
unexpected
thrill
the
revival
of
an
almost
feverish
anticipation
the
promise
of
impending
things
that
stirred
his
blood
as
he
thought
of
them
you
will
understand
strange
things
then
roger
audemard
had
said
and
something
in
his
voice
had
been
like
a
key
unlocking
mysterious
doors
for
the
first
time
and
then
wait
as
patiently
as
you
can
out
of
the
basket
on
the
table
seemed
to
come
to
him
a
whispering
echo
of
that
same
word
wait
he
laid
his
hands
upon
it
and
a
pulse
of
life
came
with
the
imagined
whispering
it
was
from
it
seemed
as
though
the
warmth
of
her
hands
were
still
there
and
as
he
removed
the
cloth
the
sweet
breath
of
her
came
to
him
and
then
in
the
next
instant
he
was
trying
to
laugh
at
himself
and
trying
equally
hard
to
call
himself
a
fool
for
it
was
the
breath
of
things
which
her
fingers
had
made
yet
never
had
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
presence
more
strangely
in
his
heart
he
did
not
try
to
explain
to
himself
why
roger
audemard
visit
had
broken
down
things
which
had
seemed
insurmountable
an
hour
ago
analysis
was
impossible
because
he
knew
the
transformation
within
himself
was
without
a
shred
of
reason
but
it
had
come
and
with
it
his
imprisonment
took
on
another
form
where
before
there
had
been
thought
of
escape
and
a
scheming
to
jail
black
roger
there
filled
him
now
an
intense
desire
to
reach
the
yellowknife
and
the
chateau
boulain
it
was
after
midnight
when
he
went
to
bed
and
he
was
up
with
the
early
dawn
with
the
first
break
of
day
the
bateau
men
were
preparing
their
breakfast
david
was
glad
he
was
eager
for
the
day
work
to
begin
and
in
that
eagerness
he
pounded
on
the
door
and
called
out
to
joe
clamart
that
he
was
ready
for
his
breakfast
with
the
rest
of
them
but
that
he
wanted
only
hot
coffee
to
go
with
what
black
roger
had
brought
to
him
in
the
basket
that
afternoon
the
bateau
passed
fort
mcmurray
and
before
the
sun
was
well
down
in
the
west
carrigan
saw
the
green
slopes
of
thickwood
hills
and
the
rising
peaks
of
birch
mountains
he
laughed
outright
as
he
thought
of
corporal
anderson
and
constable
frazer
at
fort
mcmurray
whose
chief
duty
was
to
watch
the
big
waterway
how
their
eyes
would
pop
if
they
could
see
through
the
padlocked
door
of
his
prison
but
he
had
no
inclination
to
be
discovered
now
he
wanted
to
go
on
and
with
a
growing
exultation
he
saw
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
the
bateau
crew
to
loiter
on
the
way
there
was
no
stop
at
noon
and
the
did
not
come
until
the
last
glow
of
day
was
darkening
into
the
gloom
of
night
in
the
sky
for
sixteen
hours
the
bateau
had
traveled
steadily
and
it
could
not
have
made
less
than
sixty
miles
as
the
river
ran
the
raft
david
figured
had
not
traveled
a
third
of
the
distance
the
fact
that
the
bateau
progress
would
bring
him
to
chateau
boulain
many
days
and
perhaps
weeks
before
black
roger
and
could
arrive
on
the
raft
did
not
check
his
enthusiasm
it
was
this
interval
between
their
arrivals
which
held
a
great
speculative
promise
for
him
in
that
time
if
his
efficiency
had
not
entirely
deserted
him
he
would
surely
make
discoveries
of
importance
day
after
day
the
journey
continued
without
rest
on
the
fourth
day
after
leaving
fort
mcmurray
it
was
joe
clamart
who
brought
in
supper
and
he
grunted
a
protest
at
his
long
hours
of
labor
at
the
sweeps
when
david
questioned
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
his
mouth
closed
tight
as
a
clam
on
the
fifth
the
bateau
crossed
the
narrow
western
neck
of
lake
athabasca
slipping
past
chipewyan
in
the
night
and
on
the
sixth
it
entered
the
slave
river
it
was
the
fourteenth
day
when
the
bateau
entered
great
slave
lake
and
the
second
night
after
that
as
dusk
gathered
thickly
between
the
forest
walls
of
the
yellowknife
david
knew
that
at
last
they
had
reached
the
mouth
of
the
dark
and
mysterious
stream
which
led
to
the
still
more
mysterious
domain
of
black
roger
audemard
that
night
the
rejoicing
of
the
bateau
men
ashore
was
that
of
men
who
had
come
out
from
under
a
strain
and
were
throwing
off
its
tension
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
a
great
fire
was
built
and
the
men
sang
and
laughed
and
shouted
as
they
piled
wood
upon
it
in
the
flare
of
this
fire
a
smaller
one
was
built
and
kettles
and
pans
were
soon
bubbling
and
sizzling
over
it
and
a
great
coffee
pot
that
held
two
gallons
sent
out
its
steam
laden
with
an
aroma
that
mingled
joyously
with
the
balsam
and
cedar
smells
in
the
air
david
could
see
the
whole
thing
from
his
window
and
when
joe
clamart
came
in
with
supper
he
found
the
meat
they
were
cooking
over
the
fire
was
fresh
moose
steak
as
there
had
been
no
trading
or
firing
of
guns
coming
down
he
was
puzzled
and
when
he
asked
where
the
meat
had
come
from
joe
clamart
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
winked
an
eye
and
went
out
singing
about
the
allouette
bird
that
had
everything
plucked
from
it
one
by
one
but
david
noticed
there
were
never
more
than
four
men
ashore
at
the
same
time
at
least
one
was
always
aboard
the
bateau
watching
his
door
and
windows
and
he
too
felt
the
thrill
of
an
excitement
working
subtly
within
him
and
this
thrill
pounded
in
swifter
running
blood
when
he
saw
the
men
about
the
fire
jump
to
their
feet
suddenly
and
go
to
meet
new
and
shadowy
figures
that
came
up
indistinctly
just
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
gloom
there
they
mingled
and
were
lost
in
identity
for
a
long
time
and
david
wondered
if
the
newcomers
were
of
the
people
of
chateau
boulain
after
that
bateese
and
joe
clamart
and
two
others
stamped
out
the
fires
and
came
over
the
plank
to
the
bateau
to
sleep
david
followed
their
example
and
went
to
bed
the
cook
fires
were
burning
again
before
the
gray
dawn
was
broken
by
a
tint
of
the
sun
and
when
the
voices
of
many
men
roused
david
he
went
to
his
window
and
saw
a
dozen
figures
where
last
night
there
had
been
only
four
when
it
grew
lighter
he
recognized
none
of
them
all
were
strangers
then
he
realized
the
significance
of
their
presence
the
bateau
had
been
traveling
north
but
downstream
now
it
would
still
travel
north
but
the
water
of
the
flowed
south
into
great
slave
lake
and
the
bateau
must
be
towed
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
two
big
york
boats
a
little
later
and
six
rowers
to
a
boat
and
after
that
the
bateau
set
out
slowly
but
steadily
upstream
for
hours
david
was
at
one
window
or
the
other
with
something
of
awe
working
inside
him
as
he
saw
what
they
were
passing
through
and
between
he
fancied
the
water
trail
was
like
an
entrance
into
a
forbidden
land
a
region
of
vast
and
unbroken
mystery
a
country
of
enchantment
possibly
of
death
shut
out
from
the
world
he
had
known
for
the
stream
narrowed
and
the
forest
along
the
shores
was
so
dense
he
could
not
see
into
it
the
hung
in
a
tangled
canopy
overhead
and
a
gloom
of
twilight
filled
the
channel
below
so
that
where
the
sun
shot
through
it
was
like
filtered
moonlight
shining
on
black
oil
there
was
no
sound
except
the
dull
steady
beat
of
the
rowers
oars
and
the
ripple
of
water
along
the
sides
of
the
bateau
the
men
did
not
sing
or
laugh
and
if
they
talked
it
must
have
been
in
whispers
there
was
no
cry
of
birds
from
ashore
and
once
david
saw
joe
clamart
face
as
he
passed
the
window
and
it
was
set
and
hard
and
filled
with
the
superstition
of
a
man
who
was
passing
through
a
and
then
suddenly
the
end
of
it
came
a
flood
of
sunlight
burst
in
at
the
windows
and
all
at
once
voices
came
from
ahead
a
laugh
a
shout
and
a
yell
of
rejoicing
from
the
bateau
and
joe
clamart
started
again
the
everlasting
song
of
the
allouette
bird
that
was
plucked
of
everything
it
had
carrigan
found
himself
grinning
they
were
a
queer
people
these
northerners
still
moved
by
the
superstitions
of
children
yet
he
conceded
that
the
awesome
deadness
of
the
forest
passage
had
put
strange
thoughts
into
his
own
heart
before
nightfall
bateese
and
joe
clamart
came
in
and
tied
his
arms
behind
him
and
he
was
taken
ashore
with
the
rumble
of
a
waterfall
in
his
ears
for
two
hours
he
watched
the
labors
of
the
men
as
they
beached
the
bateau
on
long
rollers
of
smooth
birch
and
rolled
it
foot
by
foot
over
a
cleared
trail
until
it
was
launched
again
above
the
waterfall
then
he
was
led
back
into
the
cabin
and
his
arms
freed
that
night
he
went
to
sleep
with
the
music
of
the
waterfall
in
his
ears
the
second
day
the
yellowknife
seemed
to
be
no
longer
a
river
but
a
narrow
lake
and
the
third
day
the
rowers
came
into
the
nine
lake
country
at
noon
and
until
another
dusk
the
bateau
threaded
its
way
through
twisting
channels
and
impenetrable
forests
and
beached
at
last
at
the
edge
of
a
great
open
where
the
timber
had
been
cut
there
was
more
excitement
here
but
it
was
too
dark
for
david
to
understand
the
meaning
of
it
there
were
many
voices
dogs
barked
then
voices
were
at
his
door
a
key
rattled
in
the
lock
and
it
opened
david
saw
bateese
and
joe
clamart
first
and
then
to
his
amazement
black
roger
audemard
stood
there
smiling
at
him
and
nodding
it
was
impossible
for
david
to
repress
his
astonishment
welcome
to
chateau
boulain
greeted
black
roger
you
are
surprised
well
i
beat
you
out
by
half
a
dozen
hours
in
a
canoe
it
is
only
courtesy
that
i
should
be
here
to
give
you
welcome
behind
him
bateese
and
joe
clamart
were
grinning
widely
and
then
both
came
in
and
joe
clamart
picked
up
his
and
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
if
you
will
come
with
us
david
followed
and
when
he
stepped
ashore
there
were
bateese
and
joe
clamart
and
one
other
behind
him
and
three
or
four
shadowy
figures
ahead
with
black
roger
walking
at
his
side
there
were
no
more
voices
and
the
dog
had
ceased
barking
ahead
was
a
wall
of
darkness
which
was
the
deep
black
forest
beyond
the
clearing
and
into
it
led
a
trail
which
they
followed
it
was
a
path
worn
smooth
by
the
travel
of
many
feet
and
for
a
mile
not
a
star
broke
through
the
overhead
nor
did
a
flash
of
light
break
the
utter
chaos
of
the
way
but
once
when
joe
clamart
lighted
his
pipe
no
one
spoke
even
black
roger
was
silent
and
david
found
no
word
to
say
at
the
end
of
the
mile
the
trees
began
to
open
above
their
heads
and
they
soon
came
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
in
the
darkness
david
caught
his
breath
dead
ahead
not
a
rifle
shot
away
was
the
chateau
boulain
he
knew
it
before
black
roger
had
said
a
word
he
guessed
it
by
the
lighted
windows
full
a
score
of
them
without
a
curtain
drawn
to
shut
out
their
illumination
from
the
night
he
could
see
nothing
but
these
lights
yet
they
measured
off
a
mighty
place
to
be
built
of
logs
in
the
heart
of
a
wilderness
and
at
his
side
he
heard
black
roger
chuckling
in
low
exultation
our
home
he
said
tomorrow
when
you
see
it
in
the
light
of
day
you
will
say
it
is
the
finest
chateau
in
the
north
all
built
of
sweet
cedar
where
birch
is
not
used
so
that
even
in
the
deep
snows
it
gives
us
the
perfume
of
springtime
and
flowers
david
did
not
answer
and
in
a
moment
audemard
said
only
on
christmas
and
new
year
and
at
birthdays
and
wedding
feasts
is
it
lighted
up
like
that
tonight
it
is
in
your
honor
david
again
he
laughed
softly
and
under
his
breath
he
added
and
there
is
some
one
waiting
for
you
there
whom
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
david
heart
gave
a
jump
there
was
meaning
in
black
roger
words
and
no
double
twist
to
what
he
meant
had
come
ahead
with
her
husband
now
as
they
passed
on
to
the
brilliantly
lighted
chateau
david
made
out
the
indistinct
outlines
of
other
buildings
almost
hidden
in
the
shadows
of
the
with
now
and
then
a
ray
of
light
to
show
people
were
in
them
but
there
was
a
brooding
silence
over
it
all
which
made
him
wonder
for
there
was
no
voice
no
bark
of
dog
not
even
the
opening
or
closing
of
a
door
as
they
drew
nearer
he
saw
a
great
veranda
reaching
the
length
of
the
chateau
with
screening
to
keep
out
the
summer
pests
of
mosquitoes
and
flies
and
the
night
prowling
insects
attracted
by
light
into
this
they
went
up
wide
birch
steps
and
ahead
of
them
was
a
door
so
heavy
it
looked
like
the
postern
gate
of
a
castle
black
roger
opened
it
and
in
a
moment
david
stood
beside
him
in
a
dimly
lighted
hall
where
the
mounted
heads
of
wild
beasts
looked
down
like
startled
things
from
the
gloom
of
the
walls
and
then
david
heard
the
low
sweet
notes
of
a
piano
coming
to
them
very
faintly
he
looked
at
black
roger
a
smile
was
on
the
lips
of
the
chateau
master
his
head
was
up
and
his
eyes
glowed
with
pride
and
joy
as
the
music
came
to
him
he
spoke
no
word
but
laid
a
hand
on
david
arm
and
led
him
toward
it
while
bateese
and
joe
clamart
remained
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
hall
david
feet
trod
in
thick
rugs
of
fur
he
saw
the
dim
luster
of
polished
birch
and
cedar
in
the
walls
and
over
his
head
the
ceiling
was
rich
and
matched
as
in
the
bateau
cabin
they
drew
nearer
to
the
music
and
came
to
a
closed
door
this
black
roger
opened
very
quietly
as
if
anxious
not
to
disturb
the
one
who
was
playing
they
entered
and
david
held
his
breath
it
was
a
great
room
he
stood
in
thirty
feet
or
more
from
end
to
end
and
scarcely
less
in
width
a
room
brilliant
with
light
sumptuous
in
its
comfort
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
and
with
a
great
black
fireplace
at
the
end
of
it
from
over
which
there
stared
at
him
the
glass
eyes
of
a
monster
moose
then
he
saw
the
figure
at
the
piano
and
something
rose
up
quickly
and
choked
him
when
his
eyes
told
him
it
was
not
it
was
a
slim
beautiful
figure
in
a
soft
and
shimmering
white
gown
and
its
head
was
glowing
gold
in
the
lamplight
roger
audemard
spoke
carmin
the
woman
at
the
piano
turned
about
a
little
startled
at
the
unexpectedness
of
the
voice
and
then
rose
quickly
to
her
feet
and
david
carrigan
found
himself
looking
into
the
eyes
of
carmin
fanchet
never
had
he
seen
her
more
beautiful
than
in
this
moment
like
an
angel
in
her
shimmering
dress
of
white
her
hair
a
radiant
glory
her
eyes
wide
and
glowing
and
as
she
looked
at
him
a
smile
coming
to
her
red
lips
yes
she
was
smiling
at
him
this
woman
whose
brother
he
had
brought
to
the
hangman
this
woman
who
had
stolen
black
roger
from
another
she
knew
him
he
was
sure
of
that
she
knew
him
as
the
man
who
had
believed
her
a
criminal
along
with
her
brother
and
who
had
fought
to
the
last
against
her
freedom
yet
from
her
lips
and
her
eyes
and
her
face
the
old
hatred
was
gone
she
was
coming
toward
him
slowly
she
was
reaching
out
her
hand
and
half
blindly
his
own
went
out
and
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
fingers
for
a
moment
and
he
heard
her
voice
saying
softly
welcome
to
chateau
boulain
carrigan
he
bowed
and
mumbled
something
and
black
roger
gently
pressed
his
arm
drawing
him
back
to
the
door
as
he
went
he
saw
again
that
carmin
fanchet
was
very
beautiful
as
she
stood
there
and
that
her
lips
were
very
red
but
her
face
was
white
whiter
than
he
had
ever
seen
the
face
of
a
woman
before
as
they
went
up
a
winding
stair
to
the
second
floor
roger
audemard
said
i
am
proud
of
my
carmin
david
would
any
other
woman
in
the
world
have
given
her
hand
like
that
to
the
man
who
had
helped
to
kill
her
brother
they
stopped
at
another
door
black
roger
opened
it
there
were
lights
within
and
david
knew
it
was
to
be
his
room
audemard
did
not
follow
him
inside
but
there
was
a
flashing
humor
in
his
eyes
i
say
is
there
another
woman
like
her
in
the
world
what
have
you
done
to
your
wife
asked
david
it
was
hard
for
him
to
get
the
words
out
a
terrible
thing
was
gripping
at
his
throat
and
the
clutch
of
it
grew
tighter
as
he
saw
the
wild
light
in
black
roger
eyes
tomorrow
you
will
know
but
not
you
must
wait
until
tomorrow
he
nodded
and
stepped
back
and
the
door
closed
and
in
the
same
instant
came
the
harsh
grating
of
a
key
in
the
lock
xxv
carrigan
turned
slowly
and
looked
about
his
room
there
was
no
other
door
except
one
opening
into
a
closet
and
but
two
windows
curtains
were
drawn
at
these
windows
and
he
raised
them
a
grim
smile
came
to
his
lips
when
he
saw
the
white
bars
of
tough
birch
nailed
across
each
of
them
outside
the
glass
he
could
see
the
birch
had
been
freshly
stripped
of
bark
and
had
probably
been
nailed
there
that
day
carmin
fanchet
and
black
roger
had
welcomed
him
to
chateau
boulain
but
they
were
evidently
taking
no
chances
with
their
prisoner
and
where
was
the
question
was
insistent
and
with
it
remained
that
cold
grip
of
something
in
his
heart
that
had
come
with
the
sight
of
carmin
fanchet
below
was
it
possible
that
carmin
hatred
still
lived
deadlier
than
ever
and
that
with
black
roger
she
had
plotted
to
bring
him
here
so
that
her
vengeance
might
be
more
complete
and
a
greater
torture
to
him
were
they
smiling
and
offering
him
their
hands
even
as
they
knew
he
was
about
to
die
and
if
that
was
conceivable
what
had
they
done
with
he
looked
about
the
room
it
was
singularly
bare
in
an
unusual
sort
of
way
he
thought
there
were
rich
rugs
on
the
floor
three
magnificent
black
bearskins
and
two
wolf
the
heads
of
two
bucks
and
a
splendid
caribou
hung
against
the
walls
he
could
see
from
marks
on
the
floor
where
a
bed
had
stood
but
this
bed
was
now
replaced
by
a
couch
made
up
comfortably
for
one
inclined
to
sleep
the
significance
of
the
thing
was
clear
nowhere
in
the
room
could
he
lay
his
hand
upon
an
object
that
might
be
used
as
a
weapon
his
eyes
again
sought
the
bars
of
his
prison
and
he
raised
the
two
windows
so
that
the
cool
sweet
breath
of
the
forests
reached
in
to
him
it
was
then
that
he
noticed
the
screening
nailed
outside
the
bars
it
was
rather
odd
this
thinking
of
his
comfort
even
as
they
planned
to
kill
him
if
there
was
truth
to
this
new
suspicion
that
black
roger
and
his
mistress
were
plotting
both
vengeance
and
murder
their
plans
must
also
involve
suddenly
his
mind
shot
back
to
the
raft
had
black
roger
turned
a
clever
coup
by
leaving
his
wife
there
while
he
came
on
ahead
of
the
bateau
with
carmin
fanchet
it
would
be
several
weeks
before
the
raft
reached
the
yellowknife
and
in
that
time
many
things
might
happen
the
thought
worried
him
he
was
not
afraid
for
himself
danger
the
combating
of
physical
forces
was
his
business
his
fear
was
for
he
had
seen
enough
to
know
that
black
roger
was
hopelessly
infatuated
with
carmin
fanchet
and
several
things
might
happen
aboard
the
raft
planned
by
agents
as
as
himself
if
they
killed
his
hand
gripped
the
knob
of
the
door
and
for
a
moment
he
was
filled
with
the
impulse
to
shout
for
black
roger
and
face
him
with
what
was
in
his
mind
and
as
he
stood
there
every
muscle
in
his
body
ready
to
fight
there
came
to
him
faintly
the
sound
of
music
he
heard
the
piano
first
and
then
a
woman
voice
singing
soon
a
man
voice
joined
the
woman
and
he
knew
it
was
black
roger
singing
with
carmin
fanchet
suddenly
the
mad
impulse
in
his
heart
went
out
and
he
leaned
his
head
nearer
to
the
crack
of
the
door
and
strained
his
ears
to
hear
he
could
make
out
no
word
of
the
song
yet
the
singing
came
to
him
with
a
thrill
that
set
his
lips
apart
and
brought
a
staring
wonder
into
his
eyes
in
the
room
below
him
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
civilization
black
roger
and
carmin
fanchet
were
singing
home
sweet
home
an
hour
later
david
looked
through
one
of
the
barred
windows
upon
a
world
lighted
by
a
splendid
moon
he
could
see
the
dark
edge
of
the
distant
forest
that
rimmed
in
the
chateau
and
about
him
seemed
to
be
a
level
meadow
with
here
and
there
the
shadow
of
a
building
in
which
the
lights
were
out
stars
were
thick
in
the
sky
and
a
strange
quietness
hovered
over
the
world
he
looked
upon
from
below
him
floated
up
now
and
then
a
perfume
of
tobacco
smoke
the
guard
under
his
window
was
awake
but
he
made
no
sound
a
little
later
he
undressed
put
out
the
two
lights
in
his
room
and
stretched
himself
between
the
cool
white
sheets
on
the
couch
after
a
time
he
slept
but
it
was
a
restless
slumber
filled
with
troubled
dreams
twice
he
was
half
awake
and
the
second
time
it
seemed
to
him
his
nostrils
sensed
a
sharper
tang
of
smoke
than
that
of
burning
tobacco
yet
he
did
not
fully
rouse
himself
and
the
hours
passed
and
new
sounds
and
smells
that
rose
in
the
night
impinged
themselves
upon
him
only
as
a
part
of
the
troublous
fabric
of
his
dreams
but
at
last
there
came
a
shock
something
which
beat
over
these
things
which
chained
him
and
seized
upon
his
consciousness
demanding
that
he
rouse
himself
open
his
eyes
and
get
up
he
obeyed
the
command
and
before
he
was
fully
awake
found
himself
on
his
feet
it
was
still
dark
but
he
heard
voices
voices
no
longer
subdued
but
filled
with
a
wild
note
of
excitement
and
command
and
what
he
smelled
was
not
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
it
was
heavy
in
his
room
it
filled
his
lungs
his
eyes
were
smarting
with
the
sting
of
it
then
came
vision
and
with
a
startled
cry
he
leaped
to
a
window
to
the
north
and
east
he
looked
out
upon
a
flaming
world
with
his
fist
he
rubbed
his
smarting
eyes
the
moon
was
gone
the
gray
he
saw
outside
must
be
the
coming
of
dawn
ghostly
with
that
mist
of
smoke
that
had
come
into
his
room
he
could
see
shadowy
figures
of
men
running
swiftly
in
and
out
and
disappearing
and
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
women
and
children
and
from
beyond
the
edge
of
the
forest
to
the
west
came
the
howling
of
many
dogs
one
voice
rose
above
the
others
it
was
black
roger
and
at
its
commands
little
groups
of
figures
shot
out
into
the
gray
and
did
not
appear
again
north
and
east
the
sky
was
flaming
sullen
red
and
a
breath
of
air
blowing
gently
in
david
face
told
him
the
direction
of
the
wind
the
chateau
lay
almost
in
the
center
of
the
growing
line
of
conflagration
he
dressed
himself
and
went
again
to
the
window
quite
distinctly
now
he
could
make
out
joe
clamart
under
his
window
running
toward
the
edge
of
the
forest
at
the
head
of
half
a
dozen
men
and
boys
who
carried
axes
and
saws
over
their
shoulders
it
was
the
last
of
black
roger
people
that
he
saw
for
some
time
in
the
open
meadow
but
from
the
front
of
the
chateau
he
could
hear
many
voices
chiefly
of
women
and
children
and
guessed
it
was
from
there
that
the
final
operations
against
the
fire
were
being
directed
the
wind
was
blowing
stronger
in
his
face
with
it
came
a
sharper
tang
of
smoke
and
the
widening
light
of
day
was
fighting
to
hold
its
own
against
the
deepening
pall
of
gloom
advancing
with
the
wind
there
seemed
to
come
a
low
and
distant
sound
with
that
wind
so
indistinct
that
to
david
ears
it
was
like
a
murmur
a
thousand
miles
away
he
strained
his
ears
to
hear
and
as
he
listened
there
came
another
sound
a
moaning
sobbing
voice
below
his
window
it
was
grief
he
heard
now
something
that
went
to
his
heart
and
held
him
cold
and
still
the
voice
was
sobbing
like
that
of
a
child
yet
he
knew
it
was
not
a
child
nor
was
it
a
woman
a
figure
came
out
slowly
in
his
view
humped
over
twisted
in
its
shape
and
he
recognized
andre
the
broken
man
david
could
see
that
he
was
crying
like
a
child
and
he
was
facing
the
flaming
forests
with
his
arms
reaching
out
to
them
in
his
moaning
then
of
a
sudden
he
gave
a
strange
cry
as
if
defiance
had
taken
the
place
of
grief
and
he
hurried
across
the
meadow
and
disappeared
into
the
timber
where
a
great
spruce
gleamed
dully
white
through
the
settling
veil
of
for
a
space
david
looked
after
him
a
strange
beating
in
his
heart
it
was
as
if
he
had
seen
a
little
child
going
into
the
face
of
a
deadly
peril
and
at
last
he
shouted
out
for
some
one
to
bring
back
the
broken
man
but
there
was
no
answer
from
under
his
window
the
guard
was
gone
nothing
lay
between
him
and
escape
if
he
could
force
the
white
birch
bars
from
the
window
he
thrust
himself
against
them
using
his
shoulder
as
a
not
the
thousandth
part
of
an
inch
could
he
feel
them
give
yet
he
worked
until
his
shoulder
was
sore
then
he
paused
and
studied
the
bars
more
carefully
only
one
thing
would
avail
him
and
that
was
some
object
which
he
might
use
as
a
lever
he
looked
about
him
and
not
a
thing
was
there
in
the
room
to
answer
the
purpose
then
his
eyes
fell
on
the
splendid
horns
of
the
caribou
head
black
roger
discretion
had
failed
him
there
and
eagerly
david
pulled
the
head
down
from
the
wall
he
knew
the
woodsman
trick
of
breaking
off
a
horn
from
the
skull
yet
in
this
room
without
log
or
root
to
help
him
the
task
was
difficult
and
it
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
had
last
seen
the
broken
man
before
he
stood
again
at
the
window
with
the
caribou
horn
in
his
hands
he
no
longer
had
to
hold
his
breath
to
hear
the
low
moaning
in
the
wind
and
where
there
had
been
before
there
were
now
black
clouds
rolling
and
twisting
up
over
the
tops
of
the
north
and
eastern
forests
as
if
mighty
breaths
were
playing
with
them
from
behind
david
thrust
the
big
end
of
the
caribou
horn
between
two
of
the
bars
but
before
he
had
put
his
weight
to
the
lever
he
heard
a
great
voice
coming
round
the
end
of
the
chateau
and
it
was
calling
for
andre
the
broken
man
in
a
moment
it
was
followed
by
black
roger
audemard
who
ran
under
the
window
and
faced
the
spruce
as
he
shouted
andre
name
again
suddenly
david
called
down
to
him
and
black
roger
turned
and
looked
up
through
the
his
head
bare
his
arms
naked
and
his
eyes
gleaming
wildly
as
he
listened
he
went
that
way
twenty
minutes
ago
david
shouted
he
disappeared
into
the
forest
where
you
see
the
dead
spruce
yonder
and
he
was
crying
black
roger
he
was
crying
like
a
child
if
there
had
been
other
words
to
finish
black
roger
would
not
have
heard
them
he
was
running
toward
the
old
spruce
and
david
saw
him
disappear
where
the
broken
man
had
gone
then
he
put
his
weight
on
the
horn
and
one
of
the
tough
birch
bars
gave
way
slowly
and
after
that
a
second
was
wrenched
loose
and
a
third
until
the
lower
half
of
the
window
was
free
of
them
entirely
he
thrust
out
his
head
and
found
no
one
within
the
range
of
his
vision
then
he
worked
his
way
through
the
window
feet
first
and
hanging
the
length
of
arms
and
body
from
the
lower
sill
dropped
to
the
ground
instantly
he
faced
the
direction
taken
by
roger
audemard
it
was
his
turn
now
and
he
felt
a
savage
thrill
in
his
blood
for
an
instant
he
hesitated
held
by
the
impulse
to
rush
to
carmin
fanchet
and
with
his
fingers
at
her
throat
demand
what
she
and
her
paramour
had
done
with
but
the
mighty
determination
to
settle
it
all
with
black
roger
himself
overwhelmed
that
impulse
like
an
inundation
black
roger
had
gone
into
the
forest
he
was
separated
from
his
people
and
the
opportunity
was
at
hand
positive
that
had
been
left
with
the
raft
the
thought
that
the
chateau
boulain
might
be
devoured
by
the
onrushing
conflagration
did
not
appal
david
the
chateau
held
little
interest
for
him
now
it
was
black
roger
he
wanted
as
he
ran
toward
the
old
spruce
he
picked
up
a
club
that
lay
in
the
path
this
path
was
a
trail
where
it
entered
the
forest
beyond
the
spruce
very
narrow
and
with
brush
hanging
close
to
the
sides
of
it
so
that
david
knew
it
was
not
in
general
use
and
that
but
few
feet
had
ever
used
it
he
followed
swiftly
and
in
five
minutes
came
suddenly
out
into
a
great
open
thick
with
smoke
and
here
he
saw
why
chateau
boulain
would
not
burn
the
break
in
the
forest
was
a
clearing
a
in
width
free
of
brush
and
grass
and
partly
tilled
and
it
ran
in
a
as
far
as
he
could
see
through
the
smoke
in
both
directions
thus
had
black
roger
safeguarded
his
wilderness
castle
while
providing
tillable
fields
for
his
people
and
as
david
followed
the
faintly
beaten
path
he
saw
green
stuffs
growing
on
both
sides
of
him
and
through
the
center
of
the
clearing
a
long
strip
of
wheat
green
and
very
thick
up
and
down
through
the
fog
of
smoke
he
could
hear
voices
and
he
knew
it
was
this
great
circular
the
people
of
chateau
boulain
were
watching
and
guarding
but
he
saw
no
one
as
he
trailed
across
the
open
in
soft
patches
of
the
earth
he
found
footprints
deeply
made
and
wide
apart
the
footprints
of
hurrying
men
telling
him
black
roger
and
the
broken
man
were
both
ahead
of
him
and
that
black
roger
was
running
when
he
crossed
the
clearing
the
footprints
led
him
to
a
still
more
indistinct
trail
in
the
farther
forest
a
trail
which
went
straight
into
the
face
of
the
fire
ahead
he
followed
it
the
distant
murmur
had
grown
into
a
low
moaning
over
the
and
with
it
the
wind
was
coming
stronger
and
the
smoke
thicker
for
a
mile
he
continued
along
the
path
and
then
he
stopped
knowing
he
had
come
to
the
over
him
was
a
swirling
chaos
the
had
grown
into
a
roar
before
which
the
bent
as
if
struck
by
a
gale
and
in
the
air
he
breathed
he
could
feel
a
swiftly
growing
heat
for
a
space
he
stood
there
breathing
quickly
in
the
face
of
a
mighty
peril
where
had
black
roger
and
the
broken
man
gone
what
mad
impulse
could
it
be
that
dragged
them
still
farther
into
the
path
of
death
or
had
they
struck
aside
from
the
trail
was
he
alone
in
danger
as
if
in
answer
to
the
questions
there
came
from
far
ahead
of
him
a
loud
cry
it
was
black
roger
voice
and
as
he
listened
it
called
over
and
over
again
the
broken
man
name
andre
andre
andre
something
in
the
cry
held
carrigan
there
was
a
note
of
terror
in
it
a
wild
entreaty
that
was
almost
drowned
in
the
trembling
wind
and
the
moaning
that
was
in
the
air
david
was
ready
to
turn
back
he
had
already
approached
too
near
to
the
red
line
of
death
yet
that
cry
of
black
roger
urged
him
on
like
the
lash
of
a
whip
he
plunged
ahead
into
the
chaos
of
smoke
no
longer
able
to
distinguish
a
trail
under
his
feet
twice
again
in
as
many
minutes
he
heard
black
roger
voice
and
ran
straight
toward
it
the
blood
of
the
hunter
rushed
over
all
other
things
in
his
veins
the
man
he
wanted
was
ahead
of
him
and
the
moment
had
passed
when
danger
or
fear
of
death
could
drive
him
back
where
black
roger
lived
he
could
live
and
he
gripped
his
club
and
ran
through
the
low
brush
that
whipped
in
stinging
lashes
against
his
face
and
hands
he
came
to
the
foot
of
a
ridge
and
from
the
top
of
this
he
knew
black
roger
had
called
it
was
a
huge
rising
a
hundred
feet
up
out
of
the
forest
and
when
he
reached
the
top
of
it
he
was
panting
for
breath
it
was
as
if
he
had
come
suddenly
within
the
blast
of
a
hot
furnace
north
and
east
the
forest
lay
under
him
and
only
the
smoke
obstructed
his
vision
but
through
this
smoke
he
could
make
out
a
thing
that
made
him
rub
his
eyes
in
a
fierce
desire
to
see
more
clearly
a
mile
away
perhaps
two
the
conflagration
seemed
to
be
splitting
itself
against
the
tip
of
a
mighty
wedge
he
could
hear
the
roar
of
it
to
the
right
of
him
and
to
the
left
but
dead
ahead
there
was
only
a
moaning
whirlpool
of
wind
and
smoke
and
out
of
this
as
he
looked
came
again
the
cry
andre
andre
andre
again
he
stared
north
and
south
through
the
mountains
of
resinous
clouds
black
as
ink
were
swirling
skyward
along
the
two
sides
of
the
giant
wedge
under
that
the
flames
were
sweeping
through
the
spruce
and
cedar
tops
like
hidden
from
his
eyes
if
they
closed
in
there
could
be
no
escape
in
fifteen
minutes
they
would
inundate
him
and
it
would
take
him
half
an
hour
to
reach
the
safety
of
the
clearing
his
heart
thumped
against
his
ribs
as
he
hurried
down
the
ridge
in
the
direction
of
black
roger
voice
the
giant
wedge
of
the
forest
was
not
burning
yet
and
audemard
was
hurrying
like
mad
toward
the
tip
of
that
wedge
crying
out
now
and
then
the
name
of
the
broken
man
and
always
he
kept
ahead
until
at
last
a
mile
from
the
ridge
david
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wide
stream
and
saw
what
it
was
that
made
the
wedge
of
forest
for
under
his
eyes
the
stream
split
and
two
arms
of
it
widened
out
and
along
each
shore
of
the
two
streams
was
a
wide
made
by
the
axes
of
black
roger
people
who
had
foreseen
this
day
when
fire
might
sweep
their
world
carrigan
dashed
water
into
his
eyes
and
it
was
warm
then
he
looked
across
the
fire
had
passed
the
pall
of
smoke
was
clearing
away
and
what
he
saw
was
the
black
corpse
of
a
world
that
had
been
green
it
was
smoldering
the
deep
mold
was
afire
little
tongues
of
flame
still
licked
at
ten
thousand
stubs
charred
by
the
and
there
was
no
wind
here
and
only
the
whisper
of
a
distant
moaning
sweeping
farther
and
farther
away
and
then
out
of
that
waste
across
the
river
david
heard
a
terrible
cry
it
was
black
roger
still
calling
even
in
that
place
of
hopeless
death
for
andre
the
broken
man
xxvi
into
the
stream
carrigan
plunged
and
found
it
only
in
crossing
he
saw
where
black
roger
had
come
out
of
the
water
and
where
his
feet
had
plowed
deep
in
the
ash
and
char
and
smoldering
debris
ahead
this
trail
he
followed
the
air
he
breathed
was
hot
and
filled
with
stifling
clouds
of
ash
and
and
smoke
his
feet
struck
embers
under
the
ash
and
he
smelled
burning
leather
a
forest
of
spruce
and
cedar
skeletons
still
crackled
and
snapped
and
burst
out
into
sudden
tongues
of
flame
about
him
and
the
air
he
breathed
grew
hotter
and
his
face
burned
and
into
his
eyes
came
a
smarting
pain
when
ahead
of
him
he
saw
black
roger
he
was
no
longer
calling
out
the
broken
man
name
but
was
crashing
through
the
smoking
chaos
like
a
great
beast
that
had
gone
both
blind
and
mad
twice
david
turned
aside
where
black
roger
had
rushed
through
burning
debris
and
a
third
time
following
where
audemard
had
gone
his
feet
felt
the
sudden
stab
of
living
coals
in
another
moment
he
would
have
shouted
black
name
but
even
as
the
words
were
on
his
lips
mingled
with
a
gasp
of
pain
the
giant
stopped
where
the
forest
seemed
suddenly
to
end
in
a
ghostly
space
and
when
david
came
up
behind
him
he
was
standing
at
the
black
edge
of
a
cliff
which
leaped
off
into
a
smoldering
valley
below
out
of
this
narrow
valley
between
two
ridges
an
hour
ago
choked
with
living
spruce
and
cedar
rose
up
a
swirling
terrifying
heat
down
into
this
pit
of
death
black
roger
stood
looking
and
david
heard
a
strange
moaning
coming
in
his
breath
his
great
bare
arms
were
black
and
scarred
with
heat
his
hair
was
burned
his
shirt
was
torn
from
his
shoulders
when
david
spoke
and
black
roger
turned
at
the
sound
his
eyes
glared
wildly
out
of
a
face
that
was
like
a
black
mask
and
when
he
saw
it
was
david
who
had
spoken
his
great
body
seemed
to
sag
and
with
an
unintelligible
cry
he
pointed
down
david
staring
saw
nothing
with
his
eyes
but
under
his
feet
he
felt
a
sudden
giving
way
and
the
tangle
of
earth
and
roots
broke
off
like
a
rotten
ledge
and
with
it
both
he
and
black
roger
went
crashing
into
the
depths
below
smothered
in
an
avalanche
of
ash
and
sizzling
earth
at
the
bottom
david
lay
for
a
moment
partly
stunned
then
his
fingers
clutched
a
bit
of
living
fire
and
with
a
savage
cry
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
looked
to
see
black
roger
for
a
space
his
eyes
were
blinded
and
when
at
last
he
could
see
he
made
out
black
roger
fifty
feet
away
dragging
himself
on
his
hands
and
knees
through
the
blistering
muck
of
the
fire
and
then
as
he
stared
the
stricken
giant
came
to
the
charred
remnant
of
a
stump
and
crumpled
over
it
with
a
great
cry
moaning
again
that
name
andre
andre
david
hurried
to
him
and
as
he
put
his
hands
under
black
roger
arms
to
help
him
to
his
feet
he
saw
that
the
charred
stump
was
not
a
stump
but
the
corpse
of
andre
the
broken
man
horror
choked
back
speech
on
his
own
lips
black
roger
looked
up
at
him
and
a
great
breath
came
in
a
sob
out
of
his
body
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
get
grip
of
himself
and
his
burned
and
bleeding
fingers
closed
about
david
hand
at
his
shoulder
i
knew
he
was
coming
here
he
said
the
words
forcing
themselves
with
an
effort
through
his
swollen
lips
he
came
home
to
die
home
yes
his
mother
and
father
were
buried
here
nearly
thirty
years
ago
and
he
worshiped
them
look
at
him
carrigan
look
at
him
closely
for
he
is
the
man
you
have
wanted
all
these
years
the
finest
man
god
ever
made
roger
audemard
when
he
saw
the
fire
he
came
to
shield
their
graves
from
the
flames
and
now
he
is
dead
a
moan
came
to
his
lips
and
the
weight
of
his
body
grew
so
heavy
that
david
had
to
exert
his
strength
to
keep
him
from
falling
and
you
he
cried
for
god
sake
audemard
tell
me
i
why
i
am
only
pierre
audemard
his
brother
and
with
that
his
head
dropped
heavily
and
he
was
like
a
dead
man
in
david
arms
how
at
last
david
came
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
again
with
the
weight
of
pierre
audemard
on
his
shoulders
was
a
torturing
nightmare
which
would
never
be
quite
clear
in
his
brain
the
details
were
obliterated
in
the
vast
agony
of
the
thing
he
knew
that
he
fought
as
he
had
never
fought
before
that
he
stumbled
again
and
again
in
the
that
he
was
burned
and
blinded
and
his
brain
was
sick
but
he
held
to
pierre
with
his
twisted
broken
leg
knowing
that
he
would
die
if
he
dropped
him
into
the
heat
of
the
smoldering
debris
under
his
feet
toward
the
end
he
was
conscious
of
pierre
moaning
and
then
of
his
voice
speaking
to
him
after
that
he
came
to
the
water
and
fell
down
in
the
edge
of
it
with
pierre
and
inside
his
head
everything
went
as
black
as
the
world
over
which
the
fire
had
swept
he
did
not
know
how
terribly
he
was
hurt
he
did
not
feel
pain
after
the
darkness
came
yet
he
sensed
certain
things
he
knew
that
over
him
pierre
was
shouting
for
days
it
seemed
he
could
hear
nothing
but
that
great
voice
bellowing
away
in
the
interminable
distance
and
then
came
other
voices
now
near
and
now
far
and
after
that
he
seemed
to
rise
up
and
float
among
the
clouds
and
for
a
long
time
he
heard
no
other
sound
and
felt
no
movement
but
was
like
one
dead
something
soft
and
gentle
and
comforting
roused
him
out
of
darkness
he
did
not
move
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
for
a
time
while
reason
came
to
him
he
heard
a
voice
and
it
was
a
woman
voice
speaking
softly
and
another
voice
replied
to
it
then
he
heard
gentle
movement
and
some
one
went
away
from
him
and
he
heard
the
almost
noiseless
opening
and
closing
of
a
door
a
very
little
he
began
to
see
he
was
in
a
room
with
a
patch
of
sunlight
on
the
wall
also
he
was
in
a
bed
and
that
gentle
comforting
hand
was
still
stroking
his
forehead
and
hair
light
as
thistledown
he
opened
his
eyes
wider
and
looked
up
his
heart
gave
a
great
throb
over
him
was
a
glorious
tender
face
smiling
like
an
angel
into
his
widening
eyes
and
it
was
the
face
of
carmin
fanchet
he
made
an
effort
as
if
to
speak
hush
she
whispered
and
he
saw
something
shining
in
her
eyes
and
something
wet
fell
upon
his
face
she
is
returning
and
i
will
go
for
three
days
and
nights
she
has
not
slept
and
she
must
be
the
first
to
see
you
open
your
eyes
she
bent
over
him
her
soft
lips
touched
his
forehead
and
he
heard
her
sobbing
breath
god
bless
you
david
carrigan
then
she
was
going
to
the
door
and
his
eyes
dropped
shut
again
he
began
to
experience
pain
now
a
hot
consuming
pain
all
over
him
and
he
remembered
the
fight
through
the
path
of
the
fire
then
the
door
opened
very
softly
once
more
and
some
one
came
in
and
knelt
down
at
his
side
and
was
so
quiet
that
she
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
he
wanted
to
open
his
eyes
to
cry
out
a
name
but
he
waited
and
lips
soft
as
velvet
touched
his
own
they
lay
there
for
a
moment
then
moved
to
his
closed
eyes
his
forehead
his
hair
and
after
that
something
rested
gently
against
him
his
eyes
shot
open
it
was
with
her
head
nestled
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
as
she
knelt
there
beside
him
on
the
floor
he
could
see
only
a
bit
of
her
face
but
her
hair
was
very
near
crumpled
gloriously
on
his
breast
and
he
could
see
the
tips
of
her
long
lashes
as
she
remained
very
still
seeming
not
to
breathe
she
did
not
know
he
had
roused
from
his
sleep
the
first
sleep
of
those
three
days
of
torture
which
he
could
not
remember
now
and
he
looking
at
her
made
no
movement
to
tell
her
he
was
awake
one
of
his
hands
lay
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
so
lightly
he
could
scarce
feel
the
weight
of
her
fingers
she
laid
one
of
her
own
upon
it
and
a
little
at
a
time
drew
it
to
her
until
the
bandaged
thing
was
against
her
lips
it
was
strange
she
did
not
hear
his
heart
which
seemed
all
at
once
to
beat
like
a
drum
inside
him
suddenly
he
sensed
the
fact
that
his
other
hand
was
not
bandaged
he
was
lying
on
his
side
with
his
right
arm
partly
under
him
and
against
that
hand
he
felt
the
softness
of
cheek
the
velvety
crush
of
her
hair
and
then
he
whispered
she
still
lay
for
a
moment
utterly
motionless
then
slowly
as
if
believing
he
had
spoken
her
name
in
his
sleep
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
into
his
eyes
there
was
no
word
between
them
in
that
breath
or
two
his
bandaged
hand
and
his
well
hand
went
to
her
face
and
hair
and
then
a
sobbing
cry
came
from
and
swiftly
she
crushed
her
face
down
to
his
holding
him
close
with
both
her
arms
for
a
moment
and
after
that
as
on
that
other
day
when
she
kissed
him
after
the
fight
she
was
up
and
gone
so
quickly
that
her
name
had
scarcely
left
his
lips
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
he
heard
her
running
down
the
hall
he
called
after
her
he
heard
another
door
and
voices
and
quick
footsteps
again
coming
his
way
and
he
was
waiting
eagerly
half
on
his
elbow
when
into
his
room
came
nepapinas
and
carmin
fanchet
and
again
he
saw
the
glory
of
something
in
the
woman
face
his
eyes
must
have
burned
strangely
as
he
stared
at
her
but
it
did
not
change
that
light
in
her
own
and
her
hands
were
wonderfully
gentle
as
she
helped
nepapinas
raise
him
so
that
he
was
sitting
up
straight
with
pillows
at
his
back
it
does
hurt
so
much
now
does
it
she
asked
her
voice
low
with
a
mothering
tenderness
he
shook
his
head
no
what
is
the
matter
you
were
burned
terribly
for
two
days
and
nights
you
were
in
great
pain
but
for
many
hours
you
have
been
sleeping
and
nepapinas
says
the
burns
will
not
hurt
any
more
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
she
bent
over
him
her
hand
touched
his
face
and
now
he
began
to
understand
the
meaning
of
that
glory
shining
in
her
eyes
if
it
had
been
for
you
he
would
have
died
she
drew
back
turning
to
the
door
he
is
coming
to
see
you
alone
she
said
a
little
broken
note
in
her
throat
and
i
pray
god
you
will
see
with
clear
understanding
david
carrigan
and
forgive
me
as
i
have
forgiven
you
for
a
thing
that
happened
long
ago
he
waited
his
head
was
in
a
jumble
and
his
thoughts
were
tumbling
over
one
another
in
an
effort
to
evolve
some
sort
of
coherence
out
of
things
amazing
and
unexpected
one
thing
was
impressed
upon
him
he
had
saved
pierre
life
and
because
he
had
done
this
carmin
fanchet
was
very
tender
to
him
she
had
kissed
him
and
had
kissed
him
and
a
strange
dawning
was
coming
to
him
thrilling
him
to
his
he
listened
a
new
sound
was
approaching
from
the
hall
his
door
was
opened
and
a
was
rolled
in
by
old
nepapinas
in
the
chair
was
pierre
audemard
feet
and
hands
and
arms
were
wrapped
in
bandages
but
his
face
was
uncovered
and
wreathed
in
smiling
happiness
when
he
saw
david
propped
up
against
his
pillows
nepapinas
rolled
him
close
to
the
bed
and
then
shuffled
out
and
as
he
closed
the
door
david
was
sure
he
heard
the
subdued
whispering
of
feminine
voices
down
the
hall
how
are
you
david
asked
pierre
fine
nodded
carrigan
and
you
a
bit
scorched
and
a
broken
leg
he
held
up
his
padded
hands
would
be
dead
if
you
had
carried
me
to
the
river
carmin
says
she
owes
you
her
life
for
having
saved
mine
and
that
what
i
come
to
tell
you
about
said
pierre
the
instant
they
knew
you
were
able
to
listen
both
carmin
and
insisted
that
i
come
and
tell
you
things
but
if
you
do
feel
well
enough
to
hear
me
now
go
on
almost
threatened
david
the
look
of
cheer
which
had
illumined
pierre
face
faded
away
and
david
saw
in
its
place
the
lines
of
sorrow
which
had
settled
there
he
turned
his
gaze
toward
a
window
through
which
the
afternoon
sun
was
coming
and
nodded
slowly
you
saw
out
there
he
dead
they
buried
him
in
a
casket
made
of
sweet
cedar
he
loved
the
smell
of
that
he
was
like
a
little
child
and
once
a
long
time
ago
he
was
a
splendid
man
a
greater
and
better
man
than
pierre
his
brother
will
ever
be
what
he
did
was
right
and
just
david
he
was
the
oldest
sixteen
when
the
thing
happened
i
was
only
nine
and
did
fully
understand
but
he
saw
it
all
the
death
of
our
father
because
a
powerful
factor
wanted
my
mother
and
after
that
he
knew
how
and
why
our
mother
died
but
not
a
word
of
it
did
he
tell
us
until
years
later
after
the
day
of
vengeance
was
past
you
understand
david
he
did
want
me
in
that
he
did
it
alone
with
good
friends
from
the
upper
north
he
killed
the
murderers
of
our
mother
and
father
and
then
he
buried
himself
deeper
into
the
forests
with
us
and
we
took
our
mother
family
names
which
was
boulain
and
settled
here
on
the
yellowknife
roger
black
roger
as
you
know
him
brought
the
bones
of
our
father
and
mother
and
buried
them
over
in
the
edge
of
that
plain
where
he
died
and
where
our
first
cabin
stood
five
years
ago
a
falling
tree
crushed
him
out
of
shape
and
his
mind
went
at
the
same
time
so
that
he
has
been
like
a
little
child
and
was
always
seeking
for
roger
audemard
the
man
he
once
was
that
was
the
man
your
law
wanted
roger
audemard
our
brother
our
brother
cried
david
who
is
the
other
my
sister
yes
good
god
choked
david
pierre
do
you
lie
is
this
another
bit
of
trickery
it
is
the
truth
said
pierre
is
my
sister
and
carmin
whom
you
saw
in
my
arms
through
the
cabin
window
he
paused
smiling
into
david
staring
eyes
taking
full
measure
of
recompense
in
the
other
attitude
as
he
is
my
wife
david
a
great
gasp
of
breath
came
out
of
carrigan
yes
my
wife
and
the
woman
that
ever
lived
without
one
exception
in
all
the
world
cried
pierre
a
fierce
pride
in
his
voice
it
was
she
and
not
who
shot
you
on
that
strip
of
sand
david
carrigan
mon
dieu
i
tell
you
not
one
woman
in
a
million
would
have
done
what
she
did
let
you
live
why
listen
and
you
will
understand
at
last
she
had
a
brother
years
younger
than
she
and
to
that
brother
she
was
mother
sister
everything
because
they
had
no
parents
almost
from
babyhood
she
worshiped
him
and
he
was
bad
yet
the
worse
he
became
the
more
she
loved
him
and
prayed
for
him
years
ago
she
became
my
wife
and
i
fought
with
her
to
save
the
brother
but
he
belonged
to
the
devil
hand
and
foot
and
at
last
he
left
us
and
went
south
and
became
what
he
was
when
you
were
sent
out
to
get
him
sergeant
carrigan
it
was
then
that
my
wife
went
down
to
make
a
last
fight
to
save
him
to
bring
him
back
and
you
know
how
she
made
that
fight
until
the
day
you
hanged
him
pierre
was
leaning
from
his
chair
his
face
ablaze
tell
me
did
she
not
fight
he
cried
and
you
until
the
last
did
you
not
fight
to
have
her
put
behind
prison
bars
with
her
brother
yes
it
is
so
murmured
carrigan
she
hated
you
went
on
pierre
you
hanged
her
brother
who
was
almost
a
part
of
her
flesh
and
body
he
was
bad
but
he
had
been
hers
from
babyhood
and
a
mother
will
love
her
son
if
he
is
a
devil
and
then
i
wo
take
long
to
tell
the
rest
of
it
through
friends
she
learned
that
you
who
had
hanged
her
brother
were
on
your
way
to
run
down
roger
audemard
and
roger
audemard
mind
you
was
the
same
as
myself
for
i
had
sworn
to
take
my
brother
place
if
it
became
necessary
she
was
on
the
bateau
with
when
the
messenger
came
she
had
but
one
desire
to
save
me
to
kill
you
if
it
had
been
some
other
man
but
it
was
you
who
had
hanged
her
brother
she
disappeared
from
the
bateau
that
day
with
a
rifle
you
know
david
what
happened
heard
the
shooting
and
came
alone
just
as
you
rolled
out
in
the
sand
as
if
dead
it
was
she
who
ran
out
to
you
first
while
my
carmin
crouched
there
with
her
rifle
ready
to
send
another
bullet
into
you
if
you
moved
it
was
you
saw
standing
over
you
it
was
she
who
knelt
down
at
your
side
and
then
pierre
paused
and
he
smiled
and
then
grimaced
as
he
tried
to
rub
his
two
bandaged
hands
together
david
fate
mixes
things
up
in
a
funny
way
my
carmin
came
out
and
stood
over
you
hating
you
and
knelt
down
there
at
your
side
loving
you
yes
it
is
true
and
over
you
they
fought
for
life
or
death
and
love
won
because
it
is
always
stronger
than
hate
besides
as
you
lay
there
bleeding
and
helpless
you
looked
different
to
my
carmin
than
as
you
did
when
you
hanged
her
brother
so
they
dragged
you
up
under
a
tree
and
after
that
they
plotted
together
and
planned
while
i
was
away
up
the
river
on
the
raft
the
feminine
mind
works
strangely
david
and
perhaps
it
was
that
thing
we
call
intuition
which
made
them
do
what
they
did
knew
it
would
never
do
for
you
to
see
and
recognize
my
carmin
so
in
their
scheming
of
things
she
insisted
on
passing
herself
off
as
my
wife
while
my
carmin
came
back
in
a
canoe
to
meet
me
they
were
frightened
and
when
i
came
the
whole
thing
had
gone
too
far
for
me
to
mend
and
i
knew
the
false
game
must
be
played
out
to
the
end
when
i
saw
what
was
happening
that
you
loved
so
well
that
you
were
willing
to
fight
for
her
honor
even
when
you
thought
she
was
my
wife
i
was
sure
it
would
all
end
well
but
i
could
take
no
chances
until
i
knew
and
so
there
were
bars
at
your
windows
and
pierre
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
the
lines
of
grief
came
into
his
face
again
and
in
his
voice
was
a
little
break
as
he
continued
if
roger
had
not
gone
out
there
to
fight
back
the
flames
from
the
graves
of
his
dead
i
had
planned
to
tell
you
as
much
as
i
dared
david
and
i
had
faith
that
your
love
for
our
sister
would
win
i
did
not
tell
you
on
the
river
because
i
wanted
you
to
see
with
your
own
eyes
our
paradise
up
here
and
i
knew
you
would
not
destroy
it
once
you
were
a
part
of
it
and
so
i
could
not
tell
you
carmin
was
my
wife
for
that
would
have
betrayed
us
and
besides
that
fight
of
yours
against
a
love
which
you
thought
was
dishonest
interested
me
very
much
for
i
saw
in
it
a
wonderful
test
of
the
man
who
might
become
my
brother
if
he
chose
wisely
between
love
and
what
he
thought
was
duty
i
loved
you
for
it
even
when
you
sat
me
there
on
the
sand
like
a
silly
loon
and
now
even
my
carmin
loves
you
for
bringing
me
out
of
the
fire
but
you
are
not
listening
david
was
looking
past
him
toward
the
door
and
pierre
smiled
when
he
saw
the
look
that
was
in
his
face
nepapinas
he
called
loudly
nepapinas
in
a
moment
there
was
shuffling
of
feet
outside
and
nepapinas
came
in
pierre
held
out
his
two
great
bandaged
hands
and
david
met
them
with
his
own
one
bandaged
and
one
free
not
a
word
was
spoken
between
them
but
their
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
men
between
whom
had
suddenly
come
the
faith
and
understanding
of
a
brotherhood
as
strong
as
life
itself
then
nepapinas
wheeled
pierre
from
the
room
and
david
straightened
himself
against
his
pillows
and
waited
and
listened
until
it
seemed
two
hearts
were
thumping
inside
him
in
the
place
of
one
it
was
an
interminable
time
he
thought
before
stood
in
the
doorway
for
a
breath
she
paused
there
looking
at
him
as
he
stretched
out
his
bandaged
arm
to
her
moved
by
every
yearning
impulse
in
her
soul
to
come
in
yet
ready
as
a
bird
to
fly
away
and
then
as
he
called
her
name
she
ran
to
him
and
dropped
upon
her
knees
at
his
side
and
his
arms
went
about
her
insensible
to
their
hurt
and
her
hot
face
was
against
his
neck
and
his
lips
crushed
in
the
smothering
sweetness
of
her
hair
he
made
no
effort
to
speak
beyond
that
first
calling
of
her
name
he
could
feel
her
heart
throbbing
against
him
and
her
hands
tightened
at
his
shoulders
and
at
last
she
raised
her
glorious
face
so
near
that
the
breath
of
it
was
on
his
lips
then
seeing
what
was
in
his
eyes
her
soft
mouth
quivered
in
a
little
smile
and
with
a
broken
throb
in
her
throat
she
whispered
has
it
all
ended
right
david
he
drew
the
red
mouth
to
his
own
and
with
a
glad
cry
which
was
no
word
in
itself
he
buried
his
face
in
the
lustrous
tresses
he
loved
afterward
he
could
not
remember
all
it
was
that
he
said
but
at
the
end
had
drawn
a
little
away
so
that
she
was
looking
at
him
her
eyes
shining
gloriously
and
her
cheeks
beautiful
as
the
petals
of
a
wild
rose
and
he
could
see
the
throbbing
in
her
white
throat
like
the
beating
of
a
tiny
heart
and
you
take
me
with
you
she
whispered
joyously
yes
and
when
i
show
you
to
the
old
man
superintendent
me
vane
you
know
and
tell
him
you
my
wife
he
ca
go
back
on
his
promise
he
said
if
i
settled
this
roger
audemard
affair
i
could
have
anything
i
might
ask
for
and
i
ask
for
my
discharge
i
ought
to
have
it
in
september
and
that
will
give
us
time
to
return
before
the
snow
flies
you
see
he
held
out
his
arms
again
you
see
he
cried
his
face
smothered
in
her
hair
again
i
found
the
place
of
my
dreams
up
here
and
i
want
to
stay
always
are
you
a
little
glad
in
a
great
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
with
windows
opening
in
three
directions
upon
the
wilderness
pierre
waited
in
his
grunting
uneasily
now
and
then
at
the
long
time
it
was
taking
carmin
to
discover
certain
things
out
in
the
hall
finally
he
heard
her
coming
tiptoeing
very
quietly
from
the
direction
of
david
carrigan
door
and
pierre
chuckled
and
tried
to
rub
his
bandaged
hands
when
she
came
in
her
face
pink
and
her
eyes
shining
with
the
greatest
thrill
that
can
stir
a
feminine
heart
if
we
only
known
he
tried
to
whisper
i
would
have
had
the
keyhole
made
larger
cherie
he
deserves
it
for
having
spied
on
us
at
the
cabin
window
but
tell
me
could
you
see
did
you
hear
what
carmin
soft
hand
went
over
his
mouth
in
another
moment
you
be
shouting
she
warned
maybe
i
did
see
and
maybe
i
did
hear
big
bear
but
i
know
there
are
four
very
happy
people
in
chateau
boulain
and
now
if
you
want
to
guess
who
is
the
happiest
i
am
no
well
then
if
you
insist
you
are
yes
and
the
next
pierre
chuckled
david
carrigan
he
said
no
no
no
if
you
mean
that
i
mean
always
that
i
am
second
unless
you
will
ever
let
me
be
first
corrected
pierre
kissing
the
hand
that
was
gently
stroking
his
cheek
and
then
he
leaned
his
great
head
back
against
her
where
she
stood
behind
him
and
carmin
fingers
ran
where
his
hair
was
crisp
with
the
singe
of
fire
and
for
a
long
time
they
said
no
other
word
but
let
their
eyes
rest
upon
the
dim
length
of
the
hall
at
the
far
end
of
which
was
david
carrigan
room
