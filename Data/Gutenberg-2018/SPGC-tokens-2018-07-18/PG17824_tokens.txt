noise

louder
oh
dear
said
little
black
sambo
there
are
all
the
tigers
coming
back
to
eat
me
up
what
shall
i
do
so
he
ran
quickly
to
a
illustration
and
peeped
round
it
to
see
what
the
matter
was
and
there
he
saw
all
the
tigers
fighting
and
disputing
which
of
them
was
the
grandest
and
at
last
they
all
got
so
angry
that
they
jumped
up
and
took
off
all
the
fine
clothes
and
began
to
tear
each
other
with
their
claws
and
bite
each
other
with
their
great
big
white
teeth
illustration
and
they
came
rolling
and
tumbling
right
to
the
foot
of
the
very
tree
where
little
black
sambo
was
hiding
but
he
jumped
quickly
in
behind
the
umbrella
and
the
tigers
all
caught
hold
of
each
tails
illustration
as
they
wrangled
and
scrambled
and
so
they
found
themselves
in
a
ring
around
the
tree
then
when
the
tigers
were
very
wee
and
very
far
away
little
black
sambo
jumped
up
and
called
out
oh
tigers
why
have
you
taken
off
all
your
nice
clothes
do
you
want
them
any
more
illustration
but
the
tigers
only
answered
illustration
then
little
black
sambo
said
if
you
want
them
say
so
or
i
take
them
away
but
the
tigers
would
not
let
go
of
each
others
tails
and
so
they
could
only
say
illustration
and
the
tigers
were
very
very
angry
but
still
they
would
not
let
go
of
each
others
tails
and
they
were
so
angry
that
they
ran
round
the
tree
trying
to
eat
each
other
up
and
they
ran
faster
and
faster
till
they
were
whirling
round
so
fast
that
you
could
see
their
legs
at
all
illustration
and
they
still
ran
faster
and
faster
and
faster
till
they
all
just
melted
away
and
then
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
great
big
pool
of
melted
butter
or
ghi
as
it
is
called
in
india
round
the
foot
of
the
tree
now
black
jumbo
was
just
coming
home
from
his
work
with
a
great
big
brass
pot
in
his
arms
and
when
he
saw
what
was
left
of
all
the
tigers
he
said
oh
what
lovely
melted
butter
i
take
that
home
to
black
mumbo
for
her
to
cook
with
so
he
put
it
all
into
the
great
big
brass
pot
and
took
it
home
to
black
mumbo
to
cook
with
when
black
mumbo
saw
the
melted
butter
was
she
pleased
now
said
she
we
all
have
pancakes
for
supper
illustration
so
she
got
flour
and
eggs
and
milk
and
sugar
and
butter
and
she
made
a
huge
big
plate
of
most
lovely
pancakes
and
she
fried
them
in
the
melted
butter
which
the
tigers
had
made
and
they
were
just
as
yellow
and
brown
as
little
tigers
and
then
they
all
sat
down
to
supper
and
black
mumbo
ate
pancakes
and
black
jumbo
ate
but
little
black
sambo
ate
a
hundred
and
because
he
was
so
hungry
