the
king
has
made
a
fair
hand
o
he
has
ended
the
wars
at
a
blow
would
my
sword
had
a
close
basket
hilt
to
hold
wine
and
the
blade
would
make
knives
for
we
shall
have
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
we
that
are
commanders
shall
do
well
enough
faith
such
commanders
as
thou
may
i
had
as
lieve
set
thee
perdue
for
a
pudding
dark
as
the
great
i
love
these
jests
exceedingly
i
think
thou
better
than
quarrelling
say
so
much
behalf
and
yet
thou
valiant
enough
upon
a
retreat
i
think
thou
wouldst
kill
any
man
that
stopt
thee
if
thou
couldst
but
was
not
this
a
brave
combate
why
didst
thou
you
stood
i
did
so
but
me
thought
thou
every
blow
they
strook
well
i
believe
there
are
better
souldiers
than
i
that
never
saw
two
princes
fight
in
lists
by
my
troth
i
think
so
too
many
a
thousand
but
certainly
all
that
are
worse
than
thou
have
seen
as
much
was
bravely
done
of
our
king
yes
if
he
had
not
ended
the
wars
glad
thou
talk
of
such
dangerous
businesses
to
take
a
prince
prisoner
in
the
heart
of
own
country
in
single
combat
see
how
thy
blood
curdles
at
this
i
think
thou
couldst
be
contented
to
be
beaten
passion
shall
i
tell
you
truly
i
i
could
willingly
venture
um
no
venture
neither
let
me
not
live
if
i
do
not
think
is
a
braver
piece
of
service
than
that
so
fam
for
why
art
thou
fam
for
any
valour
fam
i
i
warrant
you
heartily
glad
o
i
have
been
with
thee
e
since
thou
to
and
this
is
the
first
word
that
ever
i
heard
o
prethee
who
fames
thee
the
christian
world
is
heathenishly
done
in
my
conscience
thou
it
not
yes
i
ha
don
good
service
i
do
not
know
how
thou
mayst
wait
of
a
man
in
chamber
or
thy
agility
of
shifting
of
a
trencher
but
otherwise
no
service
good
you
saw
me
do
the
service
your
self
not
so
hasty
sweet
where
was
it
is
the
place
vanish
at
redemption
at
redemption
where
that
there
where
i
redeem
the
day
the
place
bears
my
name
pray
thee
who
christened
it
the
souldiers
if
i
were
not
a
very
merrily
dispos
man
what
would
become
of
thee
one
that
had
but
a
grain
of
choler
in
the
whole
composition
of
his
body
would
send
thee
of
an
errand
to
the
worms
for
putting
thy
name
upon
that
field
did
not
i
beat
thee
there
head
troops
with
a
trunchion
because
thou
wouldst
needs
run
away
with
thy
company
when
we
should
charge
the
enemy
true
but
i
did
not
run
right
i
beat
thee
out
o
but
came
i
not
up
when
the
day
was
gone
and
all
thou
knowest
and
so
do
i
thou
meanedst
to
flie
and
thy
fear
making
thee
mistake
thou
ranst
upon
the
enemy
and
a
hot
charge
thou
as
do
thee
right
thou
art
furious
in
running
away
and
i
think
we
owe
thy
fear
for
our
victory
if
i
were
the
king
and
were
sure
thou
wouldst
mistake
alwaies
and
run
away
upon
th
enemy
thou
shouldst
be
general
by
this
light
never
leave
this
till
i
fall
foul
no
more
such
words
dear
for
though
i
have
ever
known
thee
a
coward
and
therefore
durst
never
strike
thee
yet
if
thou
proceedest
i
will
allow
thee
valiant
and
beat
thee
come
our
king
a
brave
fellow
he
is
so
i
wonder
how
thou
to
know
it
but
if
thou
a
man
of
understanding
i
would
tell
thee
he
is
and
humble
and
angry
and
patient
and
merry
and
dull
and
joyful
and
sorrowful
in
extremity
in
an
hour
do
not
think
me
thy
friend
for
this
for
if
i
ear
who
knew
it
thou
shouldst
not
hear
it
here
he
is
with
his
prey
in
his
foot
senet
arbaces
tigranes
kings
and
two
thy
sadness
brave
takes
away
from
my
full
victory
am
i
become
of
so
small
fame
that
any
man
should
grieve
when
i
him
they
that
plac
me
here
intended
it
an
honour
large
enough
though
he
for
the
most
valiant
living
but
to
dare
oppose
me
single
lost
the
day
what
should
afflict
you
you
are
as
free
as
i
to
be
my
prisoner
is
to
be
more
free
than
you
were
formerly
and
never
think
the
man
i
held
worthy
to
combate
me
shall
be
us
servilely
thy
ransom
is
to
take
my
only
sister
to
thy
wife
a
heavy
one
for
she
is
a
lady
that
the
neighbour
princes
send
blanks
to
fetch
home
i
have
been
too
unkind
to
her
she
but
nine
years
old
i
left
her
and
ne
saw
her
since
your
wars
have
held
me
long
and
taught
me
though
a
youth
the
way
to
victory
she
was
a
pretty
child
then
i
was
little
better
but
now
fame
cries
loudly
on
her
and
my
messengers
make
me
believe
she
is
a
miracle
make
you
shrink
as
i
did
with
a
stroak
but
of
her
eye
the
course
of
to
use
their
prisoners
thus
had
fortune
thrown
my
name
above
i
should
not
thus
have
talk
sir
in
we
hold
it
base
you
should
have
kept
your
temper
till
you
saw
home
again
where
is
the
fashion
perhaps
to
brag
be
you
my
witness
earth
need
i
to
brag
doth
not
this
captive
prince
speak
me
sufficiently
and
all
the
acts
that
i
have
wrought
upon
his
suffering
land
should
i
then
boast
where
lies
that
foot
of
ground
within
his
whole
realm
that
i
have
not
past
fighting
and
conquering
far
then
from
me
be
ostentation
i
could
tell
the
world
how
i
have
laid
his
kingdom
desolate
by
this
sole
arm
by
divinity
stript
him
out
of
his
glories
and
have
sent
the
pride
of
all
his
youth
to
people
graves
and
made
his
virgins
languish
for
their
loves
if
i
would
brag
should
i
that
have
the
power
to
teach
the
neighbour
world
humility
mix
with
indeed
this
is
none
nay
did
i
but
take
delight
to
stretch
my
deeds
as
others
do
on
words
i
could
amaze
my
hearers
so
you
do
but
he
shall
wrong
his
and
my
modesty
that
thinks
me
apt
to
boast
after
any
act
fit
for
a
good
man
to
do
upon
his
foe
a
little
glory
in
a
souldiers
mouth
is
be
it
far
from
vain
is
pity
that
valour
should
be
thus
drunk
i
offer
you
my
sister
and
you
answer
i
do
insult
a
lady
that
no
suite
nor
treasure
nor
thy
crown
could
purchase
thee
but
that
thou
with
me
though
this
be
worse
than
that
you
spake
before
it
strikes
me
not
but
that
you
think
to
overgrace
me
with
the
marriage
of
your
sister
troubles
me
i
would
give
worlds
for
ransoms
were
they
mine
rather
than
have
her
see
if
i
insult
that
am
the
conquerour
and
for
a
ransom
offer
rich
treasure
to
the
conquered
which
he
refuses
and
i
bear
his
scorn
it
can
not
be
to
say
the
daughters
of
your
country
set
by
her
would
see
their
shame
run
home
and
blush
to
death
at
their
own
foulness
yet
she
is
not
fair
nor
beautiful
those
words
express
her
not
they
say
her
looks
have
something
excellent
that
wants
a
name
yet
were
she
odious
her
birth
deserves
the
empire
of
the
world
sister
to
such
a
brother
that
hath
victory
prisoner
and
throughout
the
earth
carries
her
bound
and
should
he
let
her
loose
she
durst
not
leave
him
nature
did
her
wrong
to
print
continual
conquest
on
her
cheeks
and
make
no
man
worthy
for
her
to
taste
but
me
that
am
too
near
her
and
as
strangely
she
did
for
me
but
you
will
think
i
brag
i
do
be
sworn
thy
valour
and
thy
passions
sever
would
have
made
two
excellent
fellows
in
their
kinds
i
know
not
whether
i
should
be
sorry
thou
art
so
valiant
or
so
passionate
wou
one
of
were
away
do
i
refuse
her
that
i
doubt
her
worth
were
she
as
vertuous
as
she
would
be
thought
so
perfect
that
no
one
of
her
own
sex
could
find
a
want
had
she
so
tempting
fair
that
she
could
wish
it
off
for
damning
souls
i
would
pay
any
ransom
twenty
lives
rather
than
meet
her
married
in
my
bed
perhaps
i
have
a
love
where
i
have
fixt
mine
eyes
not
to
be
mov
and
she
on
me
i
am
not
fickle
is
that
all
the
cause
think
you
you
can
so
knit
your
self
in
love
to
any
other
that
her
searching
sight
can
not
dissolve
it
so
before
you
tri
you
thought
your
self
a
match
for
me
in
f
ight
trust
me
she
can
do
as
much
in
peace
as
i
in
war
conquer
too
you
shall
see
if
you
have
the
power
to
stand
the
force
of
her
swift
looks
if
you
dislike
send
you
home
with
love
and
name
your
ransom
some
other
way
but
if
she
be
your
choice
she
frees
you
to
you
must
sir
i
have
learn
a
prisoners
sufferance
and
will
obey
but
give
me
leave
to
talk
in
private
with
some
friends
before
i
go
some
to
await
him
forth
and
see
him
safe
but
let
him
freely
send
for
whom
he
please
and
none
dare
to
disturb
his
conference
i
will
not
have
him
know
what
bondage
is
till
he
be
free
from
me
this
prince
is
full
of
wisdom
valour
all
the
graces
man
can
receive
and
yet
you
conquer
him
and
yet
i
conquer
him
and
could
have
hadst
thou
joyn
with
him
though
thy
name
in
arms
be
great
must
all
men
that
are
vertuous
think
suddenly
to
match
themselves
with
me
i
conquered
him
and
bravely
did
i
not
and
please
your
majesty
i
was
afraid
at
first
when
wert
thou
other
of
what
that
you
would
not
have
spy
your
best
advantages
for
your
majesty
in
my
opinion
lay
too
high
methinks
under
favour
you
should
have
lain
thus
like
a
taylor
at
a
wake
and
then
if
please
your
majesty
to
remember
at
one
time
by
my
troth
i
wisht
my
self
by
my
troth
thou
wouldst
ha
stunk
both
out
lists
what
to
do
to
put
your
majesty
in
mind
of
an
occasion
you
lay
thus
and
falsified
a
blow
at
your
leg
which
you
by
doing
thus
avoided
but
if
you
had
whip
up
your
leg
thus
and
reach
him
on
the
ear
you
had
made
the
run
down
his
head
what
country
thou
at
pish
did
not
i
take
him
nobly
why
you
did
and
you
have
talked
enough
o
talkt
enough
will
you
confine
my
word
by
heaven
and
earth
i
were
much
better
be
a
king
of
beasts
than
such
a
people
if
i
had
not
patience
above
a
god
i
should
be
call
a
tyrant
throughout
the
world
they
will
offend
to
death
each
minute
let
me
hear
thee
speak
again
and
thou
art
earth
again
why
this
is
like
speech
that
needs
would
say
i
brag
he
said
i
brag
ha
ha
ha
why
dost
thou
laugh
by
all
the
world
i
grown
ridiculous
to
my
own
subjects
tie
me
in
a
chair
and
jest
at
me
but
i
shall
make
a
start
and
punish
some
that
others
may
take
heed
how
they
are
haughty
who
will
answer
me
he
said
i
boasted
speak
did
i
he
will
not
answer
o
my
temper
i
give
you
thanks
above
that
taught
my
heart
patience
i
can
endure
his
silence
what
will
none
vouchsafe
to
give
me
answer
am
i
grown
to
such
a
poor
respect
or
do
you
mean
to
break
my
wind
speak
speak
some
one
of
you
or
else
by
heaven
so
please
your
monstrous
i
can
not
be
heard
out
they
cut
me
off
as
if
i
were
too
saucy
i
will
live
in
woods
and
talk
to
trees
they
will
allow
me
to
end
what
i
begin
the
meanest
subject
can
find
a
freedom
to
discharge
his
soul
and
not
i
now
it
is
a
time
to
speak
i
hearken
may
it
please
i
mean
not
you
did
not
i
stop
you
once
but
i
am
grown
to
balk
but
i
defie
let
another
speak
i
hope
your
majesty
thou
drawest
thy
words
that
i
must
wait
an
hour
where
other
men
can
hear
in
instants
throw
your
words
away
quick
and
to
purpose
i
have
told
you
this
and
please
your
majesty
wilt
thou
devour
me
this
is
such
a
rudeness
as
you
never
shew
me
and
i
want
power
to
command
too
else
would
speak
at
my
request
were
you
my
king
i
would
have
answered
at
your
word
i
pray
you
speak
and
truely
did
i
boast
truth
will
offend
you
you
take
all
great
care
what
will
offend
me
when
you
dare
to
utter
such
things
as
these
you
told
you
had
won
his
land
with
that
sole
arm
propt
by
divinity
was
not
that
bragging
and
a
wrong
to
us
that
daily
ventured
lives
o
that
thy
name
were
as
great
as
mine
would
i
had
paid
my
wealth
it
were
as
great
as
i
might
combate
thee
i
would
through
all
the
regions
habitable
search
thee
and
having
found
thee
sword
drive
thee
about
the
world
till
i
had
met
some
place
that
yet
mans
curiosity
hath
mist
of
there
there
would
i
strike
thee
dead
forgotten
of
mankind
such
funeral
rites
as
beasts
would
give
thee
thou
shouldst
have
the
king
rages
extreamly
shall
we
slink
away
strike
us
content
there
i
would
make
you
know
was
this
sole
arm
i
grant
you
were
my
instruments
and
did
as
i
commanded
you
but
was
this
arm
mov
you
like
wheels
it
mov
you
as
it
pleas
whither
slip
you
now
what
are
you
too
good
to
wait
on
me
i
had
need
have
temper
that
rule
such
people
i
have
nothing
left
at
my
own
choice
i
would
i
might
be
private
mean
men
enjoy
themselves
but
is
our
curse
to
have
a
tumult
that
out
of
their
loves
will
wait
on
us
whether
we
will
or
no
go
get
you
gone
why
here
they
stand
like
death
my
words
move
nothing
must
we
go
i
know
not
i
pray
you
leave
me
sirs
proud
of
this
that
you
will
be
intreated
from
my
sight
why

great
one
to

witness

who
can
outvalue
thee
thou
hast
lov
me
and
hast
wrong
thy
love
is
not
rewarded
but
believe
it
shall
be
better
more
than
friend
in
arms
my
father
and
my
tutor
good
sir
you
did
promise
you
would
hear
me
out
and
so
i
will
speak
freely
for
from
thee
nothing
can
come
but
worthy
things
and
true
though
you
have
all
this
worth
you
hold
some
qualities
that
do
eclipse
your
vertues
eclipse
my
vertues
yes
your
passions
which
are
so
manifold
that
they
appear
even
in
this
when
i
commend
you
you
hug
me
for
that
truth
but
when
i
speak
your
faults
you
make
a
start
and
flie
the
hearing
but
when
you
commend
me
o
that
i
should
live
to
need
such
commendations
if
my
deeds
blew
not
my
praise
themselves
about
the
earth
i
were
most
wretched
spare
your
idle
praise
if
thou
didst
mean
to
flatter
and
shouldst
utter
words
in
my
praise
that
thou
thoughtst
impudence
my
deeds
should
make
modest
when
you
praise
i
hug
you
is
so
false
that
wert
thou
worthy
thou
shouldst
receive
a
death
a
glorious
death
from
me
but
thou
shalt
understand
thy
lies
for
shouldst
thou
praise
me
into
heaven
and
there
leave
me
inthron
i
would
despise
thee
though
as
much
as
now
which
is
as
much
as
dust
because
i
see
thy
envie
however
you
will
use
me
after
yet
for
your
own
promise
sake
hear
me
the
rest
i
will
and
after
call
unto
the
winds
for
they
shall
lend
as
large
an
ear
as
i
to
what
you
utter
speak
would
you
but
leave
these
hasty
tempers
which
i
do
not
say
take
from
you
all
your
worth
but
darken
then
you
will
shine
indeed
well
yet
i
would
have
you
keep
some
passions
lest
men
should
take
you
for
a
god
your
vertues
are
such
why
now
you
flatter
i
never
understood
the
word
were
you
no
king
and
free
from
these
moods
should
i
choose
a
companion
for
wit
and
pleasure
it
should
be
you
or
for
honesty
to
enterchange
my
bosom
with
it
should
be
you
or
wisdom
to
give
me
counsel
i
would
pick
out
you
or
valour
to
defend
my
reputation
still
i
should
find
you
out
for
you
are
fit
to
fight
for
all
the
world
if
it
could
come
in
question
now
i
have
spoke
consider
to
your
self
find
out
a
use
if
so
then
what
shall
fall
to
me
is
not
material
is
not
material
more
than
ten
such
lives
as
mine
it
was
nobly
said
thou
hast
spoke
truth
and
boldly
such
a
truth
as
might
offend
another
i
have
been
too
passionate
and
idle
thou
shalt
see
a
swift
amendment
but
i
want
those
parts
you
praise
me
for
i
fight
for
all
the
world
give
me
a
sword
and
thou
wilt
go
as
far
beyond
me
as
thou
art
beyond
in
years
i
know
thou
and
wilt
it
troubles
me
that
i
should
use
so
rough
a
phrase
to
thee
impute
it
to
my
folly
what
thou
wilt
so
thou
wilt
par
d
on
me
that
thou
and
i
should
differ
thus
why
is
no
matter
sir
faith
but
it
is
but
thou
dost
ever
take
all
things
i
do
thus
patiently
for
which
i
never
can
requite
thee
but
with
love
and
that
thou
shalt
be
sure
of
thou
and
i
have
not
been
merry
lately
pray
thee
tell
me
where
hadst
thou
that
same
jewel
in
thine
ear
why
at
the
taking
of
a
town
a
wench
upon
my
life
a
wench
gave
thee
that
jewel
wench
they
respect
not
me
i
old
and
rough
and
every
limb
about
me
but
that
which
should
grows
stiffer
businesses
i
may
swear
i
am
truly
honest
for
i
pay
justly
for
what
i
take
and
would
be
glad
to
be
at
a
certainty
why
do
the
wenches
encroach
upon
thee
i
by
this
light
do
they
didst
thou
sit
at
an
old
rent
with
yes
faith
and
do
they
improve
themselves
i
ten
shillings
to
me
every
new
young
fellow
they
come
acquainted
with
how
canst
live
o
why
i
think
i
must
petition
to
you
thou
shalt
take
them
up
at
my
price
two
gentlemen
bessus
your
price
i
at
the
kings
price
that
may
be
more
than
worth
is

think
not
he
is
he
is
shew
our
selves
bessus
i
thought
you
had
been
in
by
this
i
bad
you
hast
will
want
entertainment
for
me
and
please
your

i
have
a
sute
not

what
i
am
to
carry
a
lady
with
me

if
i
can
prefer
her
to
the
lady
your
majesties
sister
to
learn
fashions
as
her
friends

it
will
be
worth
something
to
me

know
not
that
sir
but
gold
i
shall
be

her
from
me
so
thou
wilt
resolve
me
one
thing
if
i
can

a
very
disputable
question
and

i
think
thou
canst
decide
it
your
majesty
has
a
good
opinion
of
my
understanding
i
have
so
good
an
opinion
of
it

good
gobrias
the
king
starts
back
his
blood

back
as
fast
and
now

comes
again

alters
strangely
the
hand
of
heaven
is
on
me
be
it
far
from
me
to
struggle
if
my
secret
sins
have
pull
this
curse
upon
me
lend
me
tears
now
to
wash
me
white
that
i
may
feel
a
innocence
within
my
breast
which
once
perform
o
give
me
leave
to
stand
as
as
constancy
her
self

eyes
set
here

regardless
of
the
world

thousand
miseries

me
this
is
strange

she
dead
alas
she
not
so
happy
thou
dost
know
how
she
hath
laboured
since
my
father
died
to
take
by
treason
hence
this
loathed
life
that
would
but
be
to
serve
her
i
have
pardoned
and
pardoned
and
by
that
have
made
her
fit
to
practise
new
sins
not
repent
the
old
she
now
had
stirr
a
slave
to
come
from
thence
and
strike
me
here
whom
gobrias
sifting
out
took
and
condemn
and
executed
there
the
carefulst
servant
heaven
let
me
but
live
to
pay
that
man
nature
is
poor
to
me
that
will
not
let
me
have
as
many
deaths
as
are
the
times
that
he
hath
say
my
life
that
i
might
dye
over
all
for
him
sir
let
her
bear
her
sins
on
her
own
head
vex
not
your
self
what
will
the
world
conceive
of
me
with
what
unnatural
sins
will
they
suppose
me
loaden
when
my
life
is
sought
by
her
that
gave
it
to
the
world
but
yet
he
writes
me
comfort
here
my
sister
he
saies
is
grown
in
beauty
and
in
grace
in
all
the
innocent
vertues
that
become
a
tender
spotless
maid
she
stains
her
cheeks
with
morning
tears
to
purge
her
mothers
ill
and
that
sacred
dew
she
mingles
prayers
her
pure
oblations
for
my
safe
return
if
i
have
lost
the
duty
of
a
son
if
any
pomp
or
vanity
of
state
made
me
forget
my
natural
offices
nay
farther
if
i
have
not
every
night
expostulated
with
my
wandring
thoughts
if
ought
unto
my
parent
they
have
err
and
call
back
do
you
direct
her
arm
unto
this
foul
dissembling
heart
of
mine
but
if
i
have
been
just
to
her
send
out
your
power
to
compass
me
and
hold
me
safe
from
searching
treason
i
will
use
no
means
but
prayer
for
rather
suffer
me
to
see
from
mine
own
veins
issue
a
deadly
flood
than
wash
my
danger
off
with
mothers
blood
i
saw
such
suddain
extremities
exeunt
tigranes
spaconia
why
wilt
thou
have
me
die
spaconia
what
should
i
do
nay
let
me
stay
alone
and
when
you
see
again
you
shall
behold
a
tomb
more
worth
than
i
some
friend
that
ever
lov
me
or
my
cause
will
build
me
something
to
distinguish
me
from
other
women
many
a
weeping
verse
he
will
lay
on
and
much
lament
those
maids
that
plac
their
loves
unfortunately
high
as
i
have
done
where
they
can
never
reach
but
why
should
you
go
to
alas
that
thou
wilt
ask
me
ask
the
man
that
rages
in
a
fever
why
he
lies
distempered
there
when
all
the
other
youths
are
coursing
o
the
meadows
with
their
loves
can
i
resist
it
am
i
not
a
slave
to
him
that
conquer
me
that
conquer
thee
he
has
won
but
half
of
thee
thy
body
but
thy
mind
may
be
as
free
as
his
his
will
did
never
combate
thine
and
take
it
prisoner
but
if
he
by
force
convey
my
body
hence
what
helps
it
me
or
thee
to
be
unwilling
o
i
know
you
are
to
see
a
lady
there
to
see
and
like
i
fear
perhaps
the
hope
of
her
make
s
you
forget
me
ere
we
part
be
happier
than
you
know
to
wish
farewel
stay
and
hear
me
what
i
say
in
short
destruction

me
that
i
may
see
it
and
not
avoid
it
when
i
leave
to
be
thy
faithful
lover
part
with
me
thou
shalt
not
there
are
none
that
know
our
love
and
i
have
given
gold
unto
a
captain
that
goes
unto
from
the
king
that
he
will
place
a
lady
of
our
land
with
the
kings
sister
that
is
offered
me
thither
shall
you
and
being
once
got
in
perswade
her
by
what
subtil
means
you
can
to
be
as
backward
in
her
love
as
i
can
you
imagine
that
a
longing
maid
when
she
beholds
you
can
be
pull
away
with
words
from
loving
you
dispraise
my
health
my
honesty
and
tell
her
i
am
jealous
why
i
had
rather
lose
you
can
my
heart
consent
to
let
my
tongue
throw
out
such
words
and
i
that
ever
yet
spoke
what
i
thought
shall
find
it
such
a
thing
at
first
to
lie
yet
do
thy
best
bessus
what
is
your
majesty
ready
there
is
the
lady
captain
sweet
lady
by
your
leave
i
co
u
ld
wish
my
self
more
full
of
courtship
for
your
fair
sake
sir
i
shall
feel
no
want
of
that
lady
you
must
hast
i
have
received
new
letters
from
the
king
that
require
more
hast
than
i
expected
he
will
follow
me
suddenly
himself
and
begins
to
call
for
your
majesty
already
he
shall
not
do
so
long
sweet
lady
shall
i
call
you
my
charge
hereafter
i
will
not
take
upon
me
to
govern
your
tongue
sir
you
shall
call
me
what
you
please
gobrias
bacurius
arane
panthe
mandane
with
my
lord
bacurius
you
must
have
regard
unto
the
queen
she
is
your
prisoner
is
at
your
peril
if
she
make
escape
my
lord
i
she
is
my
prisoner
from
you
committed
yet
she
is
a
woman
and
so
i
keep
her
safe
you
will
not
urge
me
to
keep
her
close
i
shall
not
shame
to
say
i
sorrow
for
her
so
do
i
my
lord
i
sorrow
for
her
that
so
little
grace
doth
govern
her
that
she
should
stretch
her
arm
against
her
king
so
little
womanhood
and
natural
goodness
as
to
think
the
death
of
her
own
son
thou
knowst
the
reason
why
dissembling
as
thou
art
and
wilt
not
speak
there
is
a
lady
takes
not
after
you
her
father
is
within
her
that
good
man
whose
tears
weigh
down
his
sins
mark
how
she
weeps
how
well
it
does
become
her
and
if
you
can
find
no
disposition
in
your
self
to
sorrow
yet
by
gracefulness
in
her
find
out
the
way
and
by
your
reason
weep
all
this
she
does
for
you
and
more
she
needs
when
for
your
self
you
will
not
lose
a
tear
think
how
this
want
of
grief
discredits
you
and
you
will
weep
because
you
can
not
weep
you
talk
to
me
as
having
got
a
time
fit
for
your
purpose
but
you
should
be
urg
know
i
know
you
speak
not
what
you
think
i
would
my
heart
were
stone
before
my
softness
against
my
mother
a
more
troubled
thought
no
virgin
bears
about
should
i
excuse
my
mothers
fault
i
should
set
light
a
life
in
losing
which
a
brother
and
a
king
were
taken
from
me
if
i
seek
to
save
that
life
so
lov
i
lose
another
life
that
gave
me
being
i
shall
lose
a
mother
a
word
of
such
a
sound
in
a
childs
ears
that
it
strikes
reverence
through
it
may
the
will
of
heaven
be
done
and
if
one
needs
must
fall
take
a
poor
virgins
life
to
answer
all
but
let
us
talk
you
know
this
fault
is
not
in
me
as
in
another
mother
i
know
it
is
not
yet
you
make
it
so
why
is
not
all
that
past
beyond
your
help
i
know
it
is
nay
should
you
publish
it
before
the
world
think
you
be
believ
i
know
it
would
not
nay
should
i
joyn
with
you
should
we
not
both
be
torn
and
yet
both
die
uncredited
i
think
we
should
why
then
take
you
such
violent
courses
as
for
me
i
do
but
right
in
saving
of
the
king
from
all
your
plots
the
king
i
bad
you
rest
with
patience
and
a
time
would
come
for
me
to
reconcile
all
to
your
own
content
but
by
this
way
you
take
away
my
power
and
what
was
done
unknown
was
not
by
me
but
you
your
urging
being
done
i
must
preserve
my
own
but
time
may
bring
all
this
to
light
and
happily
for
all
accursed
be
this
over
curious
brain
that
gave
that
plot
a
birth
accurst
this
womb
that
after
did
conceive
to
my
disgrace
my
lord
protector
they
say
there
are
divers
letters
come
from
that
has
done
good
service
and
brought
again
a
day
by
his
particular
valour
receiv
you
any
to
that
effect
yes
is
most
certain
i
sorry
not
that
the
day
was
won
but
that
was
won
by
him
we
held
him
here
a
coward
he
did
me
wrong
once
at
which
i
laugh
and
so
did
all
the
world
for
nor
i
nor
any
other
held
him
worth
my
sword
bessus

to
my
protector

the
king
these
letters
and
to
your
grace
madam

how
does
his
majesty
as
well
as
conquest
by
his
own
means
and
his
valiant
c
o
mmanders

make
him

letters

mine
till

do
know
my
brothers

good
captain

rest
of
us

strange
souldier
that
gets
not
a
knock
i
do
not
ask
how
strange
that
souldier

had
divers
and
is

of
the
mightiness
of
his
spirit
fructifie
foreign
countries
with
his
blood
for
the
good
of
his
own
and
thus
he
shall
be
answered
why
i
may
live
to
relieve
with
spear
and
shield
such
a
lady
as
you
distressed
why
i
will
care

that
thou
art
well
i
prethee
is
he
so
the
king
is
well
and
will
be
here
to
morrow
my
prayer
is
heard
now
will
i
open
mine
i
must
ease
you
of
your
charge
madam
the
wonted
mercy
of
the
king
that
overtakes
your
faults
has
met
with
this
and
struck
it
out
he
has
forgiven
you
freely
your
own
will
is
your
law
be
where
you
please
i
thank
him
you
will
be
ready
to
wait
upon
his
majesty
to
morrow
i
will
arane
madam
be
wise
hereafter
i
am
glad
i
have
lost
this
office
good
captain
tell
us
the
discourse
betwixt
and
our
king
and
how
we
got
the
victory
i
prethee
do
and
if
my
brother
were
in
any
danger
let
not
thy
tale
make
him
abide
there
long
before
thou
bring
him
off
for
all
that
while
my
heart
will
beat
madam
let
what
will
beat
i
must
tell
the
truth
and
thus
it
was
they
fought
single
in
lists
but
one
to
one
as
for
my
own
part
i
was
dangerously
hurt
but
three
days
before
else
perhaps
we
had
been
two
to
two
i
can
not
tell
some
thought
we
had
and
the
occasion
of
my
hurt
was
this
the
enemy
had
made
trenches
captain
without
the
manner
of
your
hurt
be
much
material
to
this
business
some
other
time
i
prethee
leave
it
and
go
on
with
my
brother
i
will
but
be
worth
your
hearing
to
the
lists
they
came
and
and
gantlet
was
their
fight
alas
without
the
lists
there
stood
some
dozen
captains
of
either
side
mingled
all
which
were
sworn
and
one
of
those
was
i
and
was
my
chance
to
stand
next
a
captain
enemies
side
called
valiant
they
said
he
was
whilst
these
two
kings
were
streaching
themselves
this
cast
something
a
scornful
look
on
me
and
me
who
i
thought
would
overcome
i
smil
and
told
him
if
he
would
fight
with
me
he
should
perceive
by
the
event
of
that
whose
king
would
win
something
he
answered
and
a
scuffle
was
like
to
grow
when
one
offered
to
help
him
i
all
this
is
of
thy
self
i
pray
thee
tell
something
of
my
brother
did
he
nothing
why
yes
tell
your
grace
they
were
not
to
fight
till
the
word
given
which
for
my
own
part
by
my
troth
i
confess
i
was
not
to
give
see
for
his
own
part
i
fear
yet
this
fellow
abus
with
a
good
report
but
i
still
of
himself
cri
give
the
word
when
as
some
of
them
say
was
stooping
but
the
word
was
not
given
then
yet
one
of
the
enemies
part
held
up
his
finger
to
me
which
is
as
much
with
us
martialists
as
i
will
fight
with
you
i
said
not
a
word
nor
made
sign
during
the
combate
but
that
once
done
he
slips
o
all
the
fight
i
call
him
to
me
said
i
i
will
hear
no
more
no
no
i
lie
i
dare
be
sworn
thou
dost
captain
said
i
so
it
was
i
tell
thee
i
will
hear
no
further
no
your
grace
will
wish
you
had
i
will
not
wish
it
what
is
this
the
lady
my
brother
writes
to
me
to
take
and
please
your
grace
this
is
she
charge
will
you
come
near
the
princess
welcome
from
your
country
and
this
land
shall
shew
unto
you
all
the
kindness
that
i
can
make
it
what
your
name
very
welcome
you
have
got
a
letter
to
put
you
to
me
that
has
power
enough
to
place
mine
enemy
here
then
much
more
you
that
are
so
far
from
being
so
to
me
that
you
ne
saw
me
madam
i
dare
pass
my
word
for
her
truth
my
truth
why
captain
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
steal
i
can
not
tell
servants
are
slippery
but
i
dare
give
my
word
for
her
and
for
honesty
she
came
along
with
me
and
many
favours
she
did
me
by
the
way
but
by
this
light
none
but
what
she
might
do
with
modesty
to
a
man
of
my
rank
why
captain
here
no
body
thinks
otherwise
nay
if
you
should
your
grace
may
think
your
pleasure
but
i
am
sure
i
brought
her
from
and
in
all
that
way
if
ever
i
touch
any
bare
of
her
above
her
knee
i
pray
god
i
may
sink
where
i
stand
above
my
knee
no
you
know
i
did
not
and
if
any
man
will
say
i
did
this
sword
shall
answer
nay
defend
the
reputation
of
my
charge
whilst
i
live
your
grace
shall
understand
i
am
secret
in
these
businesses
and
know
how
to
defend
a
ladies
honour
i
hope
your
grace
knows
him
so
well
already
i
shall
not
need
to
tell
you
he
vain
and
foolish
i
you
may
call
me
what
you
please
but
defend
your
good
name
against
the
world
and
so
i
take
my
leave
of
your
grace
and
of
you
my
lord
protector
i
am
likewise
glad
to
see
your
lordship
well
o
captain
i
thank
you
i
would
speak
with
you
anon
when
you
please
i
will
attend
your
lordship
madam
take
my
leave
too
good
bes
bac
madam
what
writes
his
majesty
to
you
o
my
lord
the
kindest
words
keep
whilst
i
live
here
in
my
bosom
there
no
art
in
they
lie
disordered
in
this
paper
just
as
hearty
nature
speaks
and
to
me
he
writes
what
tears
of
joy
he
shed
to
hear
how
you
were
grown
in
every
vertues
way
and
yields
all
thanks
to
me
for
that
dear
care
which
i
was
bound
to
have
in
training
you
there
is
no
princess
living
that
enjoys
a
brother
of
that
worth
my
lord
no
maid
longs
more
for
any
thing
and
feels
more
heat
and
cold
within
her
breast
than
i
do
now
in
hopes
to
see
him
yet
i
wonder
much
at
this
he
writes
he
brings
along
with
him
a
husband
for
you
that
same
captive
prince
and
if
he
loves
you
as
he
makes
a
shew
he
will
allow
you
freedom
in
your
choice
and
so
he
will
my
lord
i
warrant
you
he
will
but
offer
and
give
me
the
power
to
take
or
leave
trust
me
were
i
a
lady
i
could
not
like
that
man
were
with
before
i
choose
him
but
i
am
not
built
on
such
wild
humours
if
i
find
him
worthy
he
is
not
less
because
he
offer
is
true
he
is
not
would
he
would
seem
less
i
think
there
no
lady
can
affect
another
prince
your
brother
standing
by
he
doth
eclipse
mens
vertues
so
with
his
i
know
a
lady
may
and
more
i
fear
another
lady
will
would
i
might
see
him
why
so
you
shall
my
businesses
are
great
i
will
attend
you
when
it
is
his
pleasure
to
see
you
i
thank
you
good
my
lord
you
will
be
ready
madam
yes
i
do
beseech
you
madam
send
away
your
other
women
and
receive
from
me
a
few
sad
words
which
set
against
your
joyes
may
make
shine
the
more
sirs
leave
me
all
i
kneel
a
stranger
here
to
beg
a
thing
unfit
for
me
to
ask
and
you
to
grant
is
such
another
strange
request
as
if
a
begger
should
intreat
a
king
to
leave
his
scepter
and
his
throne
to
him
and
take
his
rags
to
wander
o
the
world
hungry
and
cold
that
were
a
strange
request
as
ill
is
mine
then
do
not
utter
it
alas
is
of
that
nature
that
it
must
be
utter
i
and
granted
or
i
die
i
am
asham
to
speak
it
but
where
life
lies
at
the
stake
i
can
not
think
her
woman
that
will
not
take
something
unreasonably
to
hazard
saving
of
it
i
shall
seem
a
strange
petitioner
that
wish
all
ill
to
them
i
beg
of
e
they
give
me
ought
yet
so
i
must
i
would
you
were
not
fair
nor
wise
for
in
your
ill
consists
my
good
if
you
were
foolish
you
would
hear
my
prayer
if
foul
you
had
not
power
to
hinder
me
he
would
not
love
you
what
the
meaning
of
it
nay
my
request
is
more
without
the
bounds
of
reason
yet
for
is
not
in
the
power
of
you
to
do
what
i
would
have
you
grant
why
then
is
idle
pray
thee
speak
it
out
your
brother
brings
a
prince
into
this
land
of
such
a
noble
shape
so
sweet
a
grace
so
full
of
worth
withal
that
every
maid
that
looks
upon
him
gives
away
her
self
to
him
for
ever
and
for
you
to
have
he
brings
him
and
so
mad
is
my
demand
that
i
desire
you
not
to
have
this
man
this
excellent
man
for
whom
you
needs
must
die
if
you
should
miss
him
i
do
now
expect
you
should
laugh
at
me
trust
me
i
could
weep
rather
for
i
have
found
him
in
all
thy
words
a
strange
disjoynted
sorrow
is
by
me
his
own
desire
so
that
you
would
not
love
him
his
own
desire
why
credit
me
i
am
no
common
wooer
if
he
shall
wooe
me
his
worth
may
be
such
that
i
dare
not
swear
i
will
not
love
him
but
if
he
will
stay
to
have
me
wooe
him
i
will
promise
thee
he
may
keep
all
his
graces
to
himself
and
fear
no
ravishing
from
me
is
yet
his
own
desire
but
when
he
sees
your
face
i
fear
it
will
not
be
therefore
i
charge
you
as
you
have
pity
stop
these
tender
ears
from
his
enchanting
voice
close
up
those
eyes
that
you
may
neither
catch
a
dart
from
him
nor
he
from
you
i
charge
you
as
you
hope
to
live
in
quiet
for
when
i
am
dead
for
certain
i
will
walk
to
visit
him
if
he
break
promise
with
me
for
as
fast
as
oaths
without
a
formal
ceremony
can
make
me
i
am
to
him
then
be
fearless
for
if
he
were
a
thing
god
and
man
i
could
gaze
on
him
if
i
knew
it
sin
to
love
him
without
passion
dry
your
eyes
i
swear
you
shall
enjoy
him
still
for
me
i
will
not
hinder
you
but
i
perceive
you
are
not
what
you
seem
rise
rise
if
your
right
name
be
so
indeed
it
is
not
is
my
name
but
i
desire
not
to
be
known
to
other
why
by
me
you
shall
not
i
will
never
do
you
wrong
what
good
i
can
i
will
think
not
my
birth
or
education
such
that
i
should
injure
a
stranger
virgin
you
are
welcome
hither
in
company
you
wish
to
be
commanded

mean
it
so
if
i
have

deserv
my
loving
subjects
let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
revile
this
prince
in
whom
there
dwells
all
worth
of
which
the
name
of
a
man
is
capable
valour
beyond
compare
the
terrour
of
his
name
has
stretcht
it
self
where
ever
there
is
sun
and
yet
for
you
i
fought
with
him
single
and
won
him
too
i
made
his
valour
stoop
and
brought
that
name
soar
to
so
unbeliev
a
height
to
fall
beneath
mine
this
inspir
with
all
your
loves
i
did
perform
and
will
for
your
content
be
ever
ready
for
a
greater
work
the
lord
bless
your
majesty
so
he
has
made
me
amends
now
with
a
speech
in
commendation
of
himself
i
would
not
be
so
if
there
be
any
thing
in
which
i
may
do
good
to
any
creature
here
speak
out
for
i
must
leave
you
and
it
troubles

feel
a
pair
of
fiery
wings

not
tarry
there
up
and
be
gone
if
thou
beest

will
tear
thee
from
my
wounded
breast
pull
thy
lov
down
away
and
with
thy
quill
by
this
right
arm
drawn
from
thy
wonted
wing
write
to
thy
laughing
mother
bloud
that
you
are
powers
bely

your
darts
are
to
be
blown
away
by
men
resolv
like
dust
i
know
thou

misery

be
so
slow
there
can
no
falshood
come
of
loving

i
have
given
my
faith

is
a
thing
both
to
be
lov
and
serv
beyond
my

would
present
me

were
dumb

something
though
it
be
poyson
with
anger
that
it
may
strike
me
dead
have
you
no
life
at
all
for

let
her
not
kneel
and

she
but
give
it
such
a
lov
respect
you

this
lady

her
from
the
earth

yet
the
time

petitioning
lady

as
hell
by

as
false
as

my

if
it

so
speak
boldly
to
me
for
i
am
a
man
and

and
do
not
think
to
cozen
me
with
this
i
see
you
all
are
mute
and
stand
amaz
fearful
to
answer
me
it
is
too
true
a
decreed
instant
cuts
off
life
for
which
to
mourn
is
to
repine
she
a
virgin
though
more
innocent
than
sheep
as
clear
as
her
own
eyes
and
blessedness
eternal
waits
upon
her
where
she
is
i
know
she
could
not
make
a
wish
to
change
her
state
for
new
and
you
shall
see
me
bear
my
crosses
like
a
man
we
all
must
die
and
she
hath
taught
us
how
do
not
mistake
and
vex
your
self
for
nothing
for
her
death
is
a
long
life
off
i
hope
is
she
and
if
my
speech
deserve
not
faith
lay
death
upon
me
and
my
latest
words
shall
force
a
credit
from
you
which
good
gobrias
that
lady
dost
thou
mean
that
lady
sir
she
is
your
sister
and
she
is
your
sister
that
loves
you
so
is
she
for
whom
i
weep
to
see
you
use
her
thus
it
can
not
be
pish
this
is
tedious
i
can
not
hold
i
must
present
my
self
and
yet
the
sight
of
my
touches
me
as
a
sudden
does
one
that
is
about
to
sin
away
no
more
of
this
here
i
pronounce
him
traytor
the
direct
plotter
of
my
death
that
names
or
thinks
her
for
my
sister
is
a
lie
the
most
malicious
of
the
world
invented
to
mad
your
king
he
that
will
say
so
next
let
him
draw
out
his
sword
and
sheath
it
here
it
is
a
sin
fully
as
pardonable
she
is
no
kin
to
me
nor
shall
she
be
if
she
were
ever
i
create
her
none
and
which
of
you
can
question
this
my
power
is
like
the
sea
that
is
to
be
obey
and
not
disputed
with
i
have
decreed
her
as
far
from
having
part
of
blood
with
me
as
the
nak
come
and
answer
me
he
that
is
boldest
now
is
that
my
sister
o
this
is
fine

is
not
a
please
your
majesty
i
never
thought
she
was

nothing
like
you

is
not

will
speak
but
once
by
the
same
power

make
my
blood
a
stranger
unto
yours
you
may
command
me
dead
and
so
much
love
a
stranger
may
importune
pray
you
do
if
this
request
appear
too
much
to
grant
adopt
me
of
some
other
family
by
your
unquestion
word
else
i
shall
live
like
sinfull
issues
that
are
left
in
streets
by
their
regardless
mothers
and
no
name
will
be
found
for
me
i
will
hear
no
more
why
should
there
be
such
musick
in
a
voyce
and
sin
for
me
to
hear
it
all
the
world
may
take
delight
in
this
and
is
damnation
for
me
to
do
so
you
are
fair
and
wise
and
vertuous
i
think
and
he
is
blest
that
is
so
near
you
as
my
brother
is
but
you
are
nought
to
me
but
a
disease
continual
torment
without
hope
of
ease
such
an
ungodly
sickness
i
have
got
that
he
that
undertakes
my
cure
must
first
divinity
all
moral
laws
and
leave
mankind
as
unconfin
as
beasts
allowing
to
do
all
actions
as
freely
as
they
drink
when
they
desire
let
me
not
hear
you
speak
again
yet
see
i
shall
but
lang
u
ish
for
the
want
of
that
the
having
which
would
kill
me
no
man
here
offer
to
speak
for
her
for
i
consider
as
much
as
you
can
say
i
will
not
toil
my
body
and
my
mind
too
rest
thou
there
here
one
within
will
labour
for
you
both
i
would
i
were
past
speaking
fear
not
madam
the
king
will
alter
is
some
sudden
rage
and
you
shall
see
it
end
some
other
way
pray
heaven
it
do
though
she
to
whom
i
swore
be
here
i
can
not
stifle
my
passion
longer
if
my
father
should
rise
again
disquieted
with
this
and
charge
me
to
forbear
yet
it
would
out
madam
a
stranger
and
a
begs
to
be
bid
welcome
you
are
welcome
sir
i
think
but
if
you
be
not
is
past
me
to
make
you
so
for
i
am
here
a
stranger
greater
than
you
we
know
from
whence
you
come
but
i
appear
a
lost
thing
and
by
whom
is
yet
uncertain
found
here
court
and
onely
suffer
to
walk
up
and
down
as
one
not
worth
the
owning
o
i
fear
will
be
caught
he
looks
as
he
would
change
his
eyes
with
her
some
help
there
is
above
for
me
i
hope
why
do
you
turn
away
and
weep
so
fast
and
utter
things
that
your
looks
can
you
want
owning
o
is
certain
so
acknowledge
your
self
mine
how
now
and
then
see
if
you
want
an
owner
they
are
talking
nations
shall
owne
you
for
their
queen
art
not
thou
my
prisoner
i
am
and
who
is
this
she
is
your
sister
she
is
so
is
she
so
again
that
well
and
then
how
dare
you
offer
to
change
words
with
her
dare
do
it
why
you
brought
me
hither
sir
to
that
intent
perhaps
i
told
you
so
if
i
had
sworn
it
had
you
so
much
folly
to
credit
it
the
least
word
that
she
speaks
is
worth
a
life
rule
your
disordered
tongue
or
i
will
temper
it
blest
be
the
breath
temper
my
tongue
such
incivilities
as
these
no
barbarous
people
ever
knew
you
break
the
lawes
of
nature
and
of
nations
you
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
prisoner
for
theft
my
tongue
be
temper
i
must
speak
if
thunder
check
me
and
i
will
you
will
alas
my
fortune
do
not
fear
his
frown
dear
madam
hear
me
fear
not
my
frown
but
that
base
in
me
to
fight
with
one
i
know
i
can
again
thou
shouldst
be
conquer
by
me
he
has
one
ransome
with
him
already
were
good
to
fight
double
or
quit
away
with
him
to
prison
now
sir
see
if
my
frown
be
regardless
why
delay
you
seise
him
you
shall
know
my
word
sweeps
like
a
wind
and
all
it
grapples
with
are
as
the
chaffe
before
it
touch
me
not
help
there
away
it
is
in
vain
to
struggle
you
must
be
forc
sir
you
must
pardon
us
we
must
obey
why
do
you
dally
there
drag
him
away
by
any
thing
come
sir
justice
thou
to
give
me
strength
enough
to
shake
all
these
off
this
is
tyrannie
sutler
than
the
burning
bulls
or
that
fam
bed
thou
mightst
as
well
search
deep
of
winter
through
the
snow
for
half
starv
people
to
bring
home
with
thee
to
shew
fire
and
send
back
again
as
use
me
thus
let
him
be
close
tigr
bac
i
ne
rejoyc
at
any
ill
to
him
but
this
imprisonment
what
shall
become
of
me
forsaken
you
will
not
let
your
sister
depart
thus
discontented
from
you
sir
by
no
means
i
have
done
her
wrong
and
made
my
self
believe
much
of
my
self
that
is
not
in
me
you
did
kneel
to
me
whilest
i
stood
stubborn
and
regardless
by
and
like
a
god
incensed
gave
no
ear
to
all
your
prayers
behold
i
kneel
to
you
shew
a
contempt
as
large
as
was
my
own
and
i
will
suffer
it
yet
at
the
last
forgive
me
o
you
wrong
me
more
in
this
than
in
your
rage
you
did
you
mock
me
now
never
forgive
me
then
which
is
the
worst
can
happen
to
me
if
you
be
in
earnest
stand
up
and
give
me
but
a
gentle
look
and
two
kind
words
and
i
shall
be
in
heaven
rise
you
then
to
hear
i
acknowledge
thee
my
hope
the
only
jewel
of
my
life
the
best
of
sisters
dearer
than
my
breath
a
happiness
as
high
as
i
could
think
and
when
my
actions
call
thee
otherwise
perdition
light
upon
me
this
is
better
than
if
you
had
not
frown
it
comes
to
me
like
mercie
at
the
block
and
when
i
leave
to
serve
you
with
my
life
your
curse
be
with
me
then
thus
i
do
salute
thee
and
again
to
make
this
knot
the
stronger
paradise
is
there
it
may
be
you
are
yet
in
doubt
this
third
kiss

wade
in
sin
and
foolishly
intice
my
self
along
take
her
away
see
her
a
prisoner
in
her
own
chamber
closely
alas
sir
why
i
must
not
stay
the
answer
doe
it
good
sir

more
doe
it
i
say
this
is
better
and
better
yet
hear
me
speak
i
will
not
hear
you
speak
away
with
her
let
no
man
think
to
speak
for
such
a
creature
for
she
is
a
witch
a
prisoner
and
a
traitor
madam
this
office
grieves
me
nay
is
well
the
king
is
pleased
with
it
go
you
along
too
with
her
i
will
prove
all
this
that
i
have
said
if
i
may
live
so
long
but
i
am
desperately
sick
for
she
has
given
me
poison
in
a
kiss
she
betwixt
her
lips
and
with
her
eyes
she
witches
people
go
without
a
word
gob
pan
bes
spaconia
why
should
you
that
have
made
me
stand
in
war
like
fate
it
self
cutting
what
threds
i
pleas
decree
such
an
unworthy
end
of
me
and
all
my
glories
what
am
i
alas
that
you
oppose
me
if
my
secret
thoughts
have
ever
harbour
swellings
against
you
they
could
not
hurt
you
and
it
is
in
you
to
give
me
sorrow
that
will
render
me
apt
to
receive
your
mercy
rather
so
let
it
be
rather
so
than
punish
me
with
such
unmanly
sins
incest
is
in
me
dwelling
already
and
it
must
be
holy
that
pulls
it
thence
where
art
here
sir
i
pray
thee
bear
me
if
thou
canst
am
i
not
grown
a
strange
weight
as
you
were
no
heavier
no
sir
why
my
legs
refuse
to
bear
my
body
o
thou
hast
in
field
beheld
me
when
thou
knowst
i
could
have
gone
though
i
could
never
run
and
so
i
shall
again
o
no
is
past
pray
you
go
rest
your
self
wilt
thou
hereafter
when
they
talk
of
me
as
thou
shalt
hear
nothing
but
infamy
remember
some
of
those
things
yes
i
will
i
pray
thee
do
for
thou
shalt
never
see
me
so
again
bessus
they
talk
of
fame
i
have
gotten
it
in
the
wars
and
will
afford
any
man
a
reasonable
some
will
say
they
could
be
content
to
have
it
but
that
it
is
to
be
atchiev
with
danger
but
my
opinion
is
otherwise
for
if
i
might
stand
still
in
and
have
fame
fall
upon
me
i
would
refuse
it
my
reputation
came
principally
by
thinking
to
run
away
which
no
body
knows
but
and
i
think
he
conceals
it
to
anger
me
before
i
went
to
the
warrs
i
came
to
the
town
a
young
fellow
without
means
or
parts
to
deserve
friends
and
my
empty
guts
perswaded
me
to
lie
and
abuse
people
for
my
meat
which
i
did
and
they
beat
me
then
would
i
fast
two
days
till
my
hunger
cri
out
on
me
rail
still
then
i
had
a
monstrous
stomach
to
abuse
again
and
did
it
i
this
state
i
continu
till
they
hung
me
up
by
th
heels
and
beat
me
hasle
sticks
as
if
they
would
have
baked
me
and
have
some
body
for
venison
after
this
i
rail
and
eat
quietly
for
the
whole
kingdom
took
notice
of
me
for
a
whipt
fellow
and
what
i
said
was
remembred
in
mirth
but
never
in
anger
of
which
i
was
glad
i
would
it
were
at
that
pass
again
after
this
heaven
calls
an
aunt
of
mine
that
left
two
hundred
pound
in
a
cousins
hand
for
me
who
taking
me
to
be
a
gallant
young
spirit
raised
a
company
for
me
with
the
money
and
sent
me
into
with
away
i
would
have
run
from
them
but
that
i
could
get
no
company
and
alone
i
durst
not
run
i
was
never
at
battail
but
once
and
there
i
was
running
but
cudgel
me
yet
i
got
loose
at
last
but
was
so
fraid
that
i
saw
no
more
than
my
shoulders
doe
but
fled
with
my
whole
company
amongst
my
enemies
and
overthrew
now
the
report
of
my
valour
is
come
over
before
me
and
they
say
i
was
a
raw
young
fellow
but
now
i
am
improv
a
plague
on
their
eloquence
will
cost
me
many
a
beating
and
might
help
this
too
if
he
would
for
now
they
think
to
get
honour
on
me
and
all
the
men
i
have
abus
call
me
freshly
worthily
as
they
call
it
by
the
way
of
challenge
a
good
morrow
captain
good
morrow
sir
i
come
to
speak
with
you
you
very
welcome
from
one
that
holds
himself
wrong
by
you
some
three
years
since
your
worth
he
says
is
fam
and
he
doth
nothing
doubt
but
you
will
do
him
right
as
beseems
a
souldier
a
pox
on
so
they
cry
all
and
a
slight
note
i
have
about
me
for
you
for
the
delivery
of
which
you
must
excuse
me
it
is
an
office
that
friendship
calls
upon
me
to
do
and
no
way
offensive
to
you
since
i
desire
but
right
on
both
sides
is
a
challenge
sir
is
it
not
is
an
inviting
to
the
field
an
inviting
o
sir
your
mercy
what
a
complement
he
delivers
it
with
he
might
as
agreeable
to
my
nature
present
me
poison
with
such
a
speech
um
um
um
reputation
um
um
um
call
you
to
account
um
um
um
forc
to
this
um
um
um
with
my
sword
um
um
um
like
a
gentleman
um
um
um
dear
to
me
um
um
um
satisfaction
is
very
well
sir
i
do
accept
it
but
he
must
await
an
answer
this
thirteen
weeks
why
sir
he
would
be
glad
to
wipe
off
his
stain
as
soon
as
he
could
sir
upon
my
credit
i
am
already
ingag
to
two
hundred
and
twelve
all
which
must
have
their
stains
wip
off
if
that
be
the
word
before
him
sir
if
you
be
truly
ingag
but
to
one
he
shall
stay
a
competent
time
upon
my
faith
sir
to
two
hundred
and
twelve
and
i
have
a
spent
body
too
much
bruis
in
battel
so
that
i
can
not
fight
i
must
be
plain
above
three
combats
a
day
all
the
kindness
i
can
shew
him
is
to
set
him
resolvedly
in
my
rowle
the
two
hundred
and
thirteenth
man
which
is
something
for
i
tell
you
i
think
there
will
be
more
after
him
than
before
him
i
think
so
pray
you
commend
me
to
him
and
tell
him
this
i
will
sir
good
morrow
to
you
good
morrow
good
sir
certainly
my
safest
way
were
to
print
my
self
a
coward
with
a
discovery
how
i
came
by
my
credit
and
clap
it
upon
every
post
i
have
received
above
thirty
challenges
within
this
two
hours
marry
all
but
the
first
i
put
off
with
ingagement
and
by
good
fortune
the
first
is
no
madder
of
fighting
than
i
so
that
that
referred
the
place
where
it
must
be
ended
is
four
days
journey
off
and
our
arbitratours
are
these
he
has
chosen
a
gentleman
in
travel
and
i
have
a
special
friend
with
a
quartain
ague
like
to
hold
him
this
five
years
for
mine
and
when
his
man
comes
home
we
are
to
expect
my
friends
health
if
they
would
finde
me
challenges
thus
thick
as
long
as
i
liv
i
would
have
no
other
living
i
can
make
seven
shillings
a
day
paper
to
the
grocers
yet
i
learn
nothing
by
all
these
but
a
little
skill
in
comparing
of
stiles
i
do
finde
evidently
that
there
is
some
one
scrivener
in
this
town
that
has
a
great
hand
in
writing
of
challenges
for
they
are
all
of
a
cut
and
six
of
in
a
hand
and
they
all
end
my
reputation
is
dear
to
me
and
i
must
require
satisfaction
there
more
paper
i
hope
no
is
my
lord
i
fear
all
is
not
well
betwixt
us
bacurius
now
captain
i
come
about
a
frivolous
matter
caus
by
as
idle
a
report
you
know
you
were
a
coward
very
right
and
wronged
me
true
my
lord
but
now
people
will
call
you
valiant
desertlesly
i
think
yet
for
their
satisfaction
i
will
have
you
fight
with
me
o
my
good
lord
my
deep
engagements
tell
not
me
of
your
engagements
captain
it
is
not
to
be
put
off
with
an
excuse
for
my
own
part
i
am
none
of
the
multitude
that
believe
your
conversion
from
coward
my
lord
i
seek
not
quarrels
and
this
belongs
not
to
me
i
am
not
to
maintain
it
who
then
pray
the
coward
wrong
you
right
and
shall
the
valiant
maintain
what
the
coward
did
i
pray
thee
leave
these
cheating
tricks
i
swear
thou
shalt
fight
with
me
or
thou
shall
be
beaten
extreamly
and
kick
since
you
provoke
me
thus
far
my
lord
i
will
fight
with
you
and
by
my
sword
it
shall
cost
me
twenty
pound
but
i
will
have
my
leg
well
a
week
sooner
purposely
your
leg
why
what
ailes
your
leg
do
a
cure
on
you
stand
up
my
lord
this
is
not
noble
in
you
what
dost
thou
with
such
a
phrase
in
thy
mouth
i
will
kick
thee
out
of
all
good
words
before
i
leave
thee
my
lord
i
take
this
as
a
punishment
for
the
offence
i
did
when
i
was
a
coward
when
thou
wert
confess
thy
self
a
coward
still
or
by
this
light
beat
thee
into
spunge
why
i
am
one
are
you
so
sir
and
why
do
you
wear
a
sword
then
come
unbuckle
my
lord
unbuckle
i
say
and
give
it
me
or
as
i
live
thy
head
will
ake
extreamly
it
is
a
pretty
hilt
and
if
your
lordship
take
an
affection
to
it
with
all
my
heart
i
present
it
to
you
for
a
i
thank
you
very
heartily
sweet
captain
farewel
one
word
more
i
beseech
your
lordship
to
render
me
my
knife
again
marry
by
all
means
captain
cherish
your
self
with
it
and
eat
hard
good
captain
we
can
not
tell
whether
we
shall
have
any
more
such
adue
dear
captain
bac
i
will
make
better
use
of
this
than
of
my
sword
a
base
spirit
has
this
vantage
of
a
brave
one
it
keeps
alwayes
at
a
stay
nothing
brings
it
down
not
beating
i
remember
i
promis
the
king
in
a
great
audience
that
i
would
make
my
eat
my
sword
to
a
knife
how
to
get
another
sword
i
know
not
nor
know
any
means
left
for
me
to
maintain
my
credit
but
impudence
therefore
i
will
him
and
all
his
followers
that
this
is
all
that
left
uneaten
of
my
sword
bessus
mardonius
move
the
king
he
is
most
strangely
alter
i
guess
the
cause
i
fear
too
right
heaven
has
some
secret
end
i
and
is
a
scourge
no
question
justly
laid
upon
him
he
has
followed
me
through
twenty
rooms
and
ever
when
i
stay
to
wait
his
command
he
blushes
like
a
girl
and
looks
upon
me
as
if
modesty
kept
in
his
business
so
turns
away
from
me
but
if
i
go
on
he
follows
me
again
arbaces
see
here
he
is
i
do
not
use
this
yet
i
know
not
how
i
can
not
chuse
but
weep
to
see
him
his
very
enemies
i
think
whose
wounds
have
bred
his
fame
if
they
should
see
him
now
would
find
tears
eyes
i
can
not
utter
it
why
should
i
keep
a
breast
to
harbour
thoughts
i
dare
not
speak
darkness
is
in
my
bosom
and
there
lie
a
thousand
thoughts
that
can
not
brook
the
light
how
wilt
thou
vex
when
this
deed
is
done
conscience
that
art
afraid
to
let
me
name
it
how
do
you
sir
why
very
well
how
dost
thou
do
better
than
you
i
fear
i
hope
thou
art
for
to
be
plain
with
thee
thou
art
in
hell
else
secret
scorching
flames
that
far
transcend
earthly
material
fires
are
crept
into
me
and
there
is
no
cure
is
it
not
strange
there
no
cure
sir
either
i
mistake
or
there
is
something
hid
that
you
would
utter
to
me
so
there
is
but
yet
i
can
not
do
it
out
with
it
sir
if
it
be
dangerous
i
will
not
shrink
to
do
you
service
i
shall
not
esteem
my
life
a
weightier
matter
than
indeed
it
is
i
know
it
is
subject
to
more
chances
than
it
has
hours
and
i
were
better
lose
it
in
my
kings
cause
than
with
an
ague
or
a
fall
or
sleeping
to
a
thief
as
all
these
are
probable
enough
let
me
but
know
what
i
shall
do
for
you
it
will
not
out
were
you
with
and
bad
him
give
my
sister
all
content
the
place
affords
and
give
her
leave
to
send
and
speak
to
whom
she
please
yes
sir
i
was
and
did
you
to
say
as
much
about
yes
that
all
my
business
o
say
not
so
you
had
an
answer
of
this
before
besides
i
think
this
business
might
be
utter
more
carelesly
come
thou
shalt
have
it
out
i
do
beseech
thee
by
all
the
love
thou
hast
profest
to
me
to
see
my
sister
from
me
well
and
what
that
all
that
strange
i
shall
say
nothing
to
her
not
a
word
but
if
thou
lovest
me
find
some
subtil
way
to
make
her
understand
by
signs
but
what
shall
i
make
her
understand
o
for
that
i
must
be
pardon
you
may
but
i
can
only
see
her
then
is
true
bear
her
this
ring
then
and
one
more
advice
thou
shall
speak
to
her
tell
her
i
do
love
my
kindred
all
wilt
thou
is
there
no
more
o
yes
and
her
the
best
better
than
any
brother
loves
his
sister
that
all
methinks
this
need
not
have
been
delivered
with
such
a
caution
do
it
there
is
more
yet
wilt
thou
be
faith
f
ul
to
me
sir
if
i
take
upon
me
to
deliver
it
after
i
hear
it
pass
through
fire
to
do
it
i
love
her
better
than
a
brother
ought
dost
thou
conceive
me
i
hope
you
do
not
sir
no
thou
art
dull
kneel
down
before
her
and
rise
again
till
she
will
love
me
why
i
think
she
does
but
better
than
she
does
another
way
as
wives
love
husbands
why
i
think
there
are
few
wives
that
love
their
husbands
better
than
she
does
you
thou
wilt
not
understand
me
is
it
fit
this
should
be
uttered
plainly
take
it
then
naked
as
it
is
i
would
desire
her
love
lasciviously
lewdly
incestuously
to
do
a
sin
that
needs
must
damn
us
both
and
thee
too
dost
thou
understand
me
now
yes
there
your
ring
again
what
have
i
done
dishonestly
in
my
whole
life
name
it
that
you
should
put
so
base
a
business
to
me
didst
thou
not
tell
me
thou
wouldst
do
it
yes
if
i
undertook
it
but
if
all
my
hairs
were
lives
i
would
not
be
in
such
a
case
to
save
my
last
life
o
guilt
ha
how
poor
and
weak
a
thing
art
thou
this
man
that
is
my
servant
whom
my
breath
might
blow
upon
the
world
might
beat
me
here
having
this
cause
i
prest
down
with
sin
could
not
resist
him
hear
it
was
a
motion
man
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
heaven
grant
you
may
be
so
you
must
understand
nothing
that
you
can
utter
can
remove
my
love
and
service
from
my
prince
but
otherwise
i
think
i
shall
not
love
you
more
for
you
are
sinful
and
if
you
do
this
crime
you
ought
to
have
no
laws
for
after
this
it
will
be
great
injustice
in
you
to
punish
any
offender
for
any
crime
for
my
self
i
find
my
heart
too
big
i
feel
i
have
not
patience
to
look
on
whilst
you
run
these
forbidden
courses

dart
infection
on
me
and
thou

a
mouth
enough
to
take
me
in
where

stand
four
rows
of
iron
teeth

such
thing
but
is
no

than
my
sin

if
i
could
come
by
should
suffer
death
eternal
ne
to
rise
in
any
breast
again
know
i
will
die
languishing
mad
as
i
resolve
i
shall
e
i
will
deal
by
such
an
instrument
thou
art
too
sinful
to
imploy
in
this
out
of
the
world
away
what
do
you
mean
sir
hung
round
with
curses
take
thy
fearful
flight
into
the
desarts
where
all
the
monsters
if
thou
one
so
beastly
as
thy
self
thou
shalt
be
held
as
innocent
good
sir
if
there
were
no
such
instruments
as
thou
we
kings
could
never
act
such
wicked
deeds
seek
out
a
man
that
mocks
divinity
that
breaks
each
precept
both
of
god
and
man
and
natures
too
and
does
it
without
lust
meerly
because
it
is
a
law
and
good
and
live
with
him
for
him
thou
canst
not
spoil
away
i
say
i
will
not
do
this
sin
bessus
press
it
here
till
it
do
break
my
breast
it
heaves
to
get
out
but
thou
art
a
sin
and
spight
of
torture
i
will
keep
thee
in
gobrias
panthea
spaconia
have
you
written
madam
yes
good
and
with
a
kindness
and
such
winning
words
as
may
provoke
him
at
one
instant
feel
his
double
fault
your
wrong
and
his
own
rashness
i
have
sent
words
enough
if
words
may
win
him
from
his
displeasure
and
such
words
i
hope
as
shall
gain
much
upon
his
goodness
yet
fearing
they
are
many
and
a
womans
a
poor
belief
may
follow
i
have
woven
as
many
truths
within
to
speak
for
me
that
if
he
be
but
gracious
and
receive
good
lady
be
not
fearful
though
he
should
not
give
you
your
present
end
in
this
believe
it
you
shall
feel
if
your
vertue
can
induce
you
to
labour
o
this
tempest
which
i
know
is
but
a
poor
proof
your
patience
all
those
contents
your
spirit
will
arrive
at
newer
and
sweeter
to
you
your
royal
brother
when
he
shall
once
collect
himself
and
see
how
far
he
has
been
asunder
from
himself
what
a
meer
stranger
to
his
golden
temper
must
from
those
roots
of
vertue
never
dying
though
somewhat
stopt
with
humour
shoot
again
into
a
thousand
glories
bearing
his
fair
branches
high
as
our
hopes
can
look
at
straight
as
justice
loaden
with
ripe
contents
he
loves
you
dearly
i
know
it
and
i
hope
i
need
not
farther
win
you
to
understand
it
i
believe
it
but
howsoever
i
am
sure
i
love
him
dearly
so
dearly
that
if
any
thing
i
write
for
my
enlarging
should
beget
his
anger
heaven
be
a
witness
with
me
and
my
faith
i
had
rather
live
intomb
here
you
shall
not
feel
a
worse
stroke
than
your
grief
i
am
sorry

so
sharp
i
kiss
your
hand
and
this
night

deliver
this
true
story

hand
to

two
sorrows

like
two
eager
hawks
who
shall
get
highest
how
shall

lessen
thine
for

easier
known
than
cur
heaven
comfort
both
and
give
you
happy
ends
however
i
fall
in
my
stubborn
fortunes

but
teaches
how
to
be
more
familiar
with
our
sorrows
that

too
much
our
masters

shall
i
do
you

me
more
a
slave
still
to
your
goodness
and
only
live
to
purchase
thanks
to
pay
you
for
that
is
all
the
business
of
my
life
now
i
will
be
bold
since
you
will
have
it
so
to
ask
a
noble
favour
of

yours
for
from
so
sweet

your
will
in
helping
me
to
see
the
prince
with
whom
i
am
equal
prisoner

more
reserve
me
to
a
greater
end
can
not
want
so
much
good
manners
as
to
deny
your
gentle
visitation
though
you
came
only
with
your
own
command
i
know
they
will
deny
me
gracious
madam
being
a
stranger
and
so
little
fam
so
utter
empty
of
those
excellencies
that
tame
authority
but
in
you
sweet
lady
all
these
are
natural
beside
a
power
deriv
immediate
from
your
royal
brother
whose
least
word
in
you
may
command
the
kingdom
more
than
my
word
you
shall
carry
for
fear
it
fail
you
dare
you
trust
a
token
madam
i
fear
i
am
grown
too

good
to

this
ring
and
from
me
as
a
token

not
stay
you

your
own
desires

with
you

peace
to
your
grace
pray
heaven
i
find
it
tigranes
fool
that
i
am
i
have
undone
my
self
and
with
my
own
hand

my
fortune
round
that
was
a
fair
one

have
childishly
plaid
with
my
hope
so
long
till
i
have
broke
it
and
now
too
late
i
mourn
o
thou
hast
found
an
even
way
to
thy
revenge
now
why
didst
thou
follow
me
like
a
faint
shadow
to
wither
my
desires
but
wretched
fool
why
did
i
plant
thee
the
sun
and
me
to
make
me
freeze
thus
why
did
i
prefer
her
to
the
fair
princess
o
thou
fool

family
of
fools
live
like
a
slave
still
and
in
thee

thine
own
hell
and
thy
torment

hast
deserv
couldst
thou
find
no
lady
but
she
that
has
thy
hopes
to
put
her
to
and
hazard
all
thy
peace
none
to
abuse
but
she
that
lov
thee
ever
poor
and
so
much
lov
thee
that
in
honesty
and
honour
thou
art
bound
to
meet
her
vertues

that
forgot
the
greatness
of
her
grief
and
miseries
that
must
follow
such
mad
passions
endless
and
wild
as
women
she
that
for
thee
and
with
thee
left
her
liberty
her
name
and
country

have
paid
me
equal

and
sent
my
own
rod
to
correct
me
with
a
woman
for
inconstancy

it
on
justice
till
my
soul
melt
in
me
for
my
unmanly
beastly
sudden
doting
upon
a
new
face
after
all
my
oaths
many
and
strange
ones
i
feel
my
old
fire
flame
again
and
burn
so
strong
and
violent
that

your
wickedness
of
wronging

false
false
prince

false
and
then
no
more
she
lives
to
tell
thee
thou

more
unconstant
than
all
ill
women

command
as
lasting
as
boyes
gay
bubbles
blown
air
and
broken

wind
is
fixt
to
thee
and
sooner
shall
the
beaten
mariner
with
his
shrill
whistle
calm
the
loud
murmur
of
the
troubled
main
and
strike
it
smooth
again
than
thy
soul
fall
to
have
peace
in
love
with
any
thou
art
all
that
all
good
men
must
hate
and
if
thy
story
shall
tell
succeeding
ages
what
thou
wert
o
let
it
spare
me
in
it
lest
true
lovers
in
pity
of
my
wrong
burn
thy
black
legend
and
with
their
curses
shake
thy
sleeping
ashes
oh
oh
the
destinies
i
hope
have
pointed
out
our
ends
that
thou
maist
die
for
love
though
not
for
me
for
this
assure
thy
self
the
princess
hates
thee
deadly
and
will
sooner
be
won
to
marry
with
a
bull
and
safer
than
such
a
beast
as
thou
art
i
have
struck
i
fear
too
deep
beshrow
me
sir
this
sorrow
works
me
like
a
cunning
friendship
into
the
same
piece
with

asham
alas

have
been
too
rugged
dear
my
lord

am
sorry

thing
indeed
i
am
that
may
add
more
restraint
to
that
too
much
you
have
good
sir
be
to
think
it
was
a
fault
of
love
not
malice
and
do
as
i
will
do
forgive
it
prince
i
do
and
can
forgive
the
greatest
sins
to
me
you
can
repent
of
pray
believe
o
my
o
thou
vertuous
woman
nay

the
king

arbaces
bacurius
mardonius
have
you
been
carefull
of
our
noble
prisoner
that
he
want
nothing
fitting
for
his
greatness
i
hope
his
grace
will
quit
me
for
my
care
sir
is
well

more
than
the
strictness
of
this
place
can

we
thank
you
worthy
prince
and
pray
excuse
us
we
have
not
seen
you
since
your
being

i
hope
your
noble
usage
has
been
equall
with
your
own
person
your
imprisonment
if
it
be
any
i
dare
say
is
easie
and
shall
not
last
t
w
o
dayes
i
thank
you
my
usage
here
has
been
the
same
it
was
worthy
a
royal
conqueror
for
my
restraint
it
came
unkindly
because
much
unlook
for
but
i
must
bear
it
what
lady
that
one
of
the
princess
women
sir
i
fear
it
why
comes
she
hither
to
speak
with
the
prince
from
whom
from
the
princess
sir
i
knew
i
had
seen
her
his
fit
begins
to
take
him
now
again
is
a
strange
feaver
and
shake
us
all
anon
i
fear
would
he
were
well
cur
of
this
raging
folly
give
me
the
warrs
where
men
are
mad
and
may
talk
what
they
list
and
held
the
bravest
fellows
this
pelting
prating
peace
is
good
for
nothing
drinking
a
vertue
i
see
there
truth
in
no
man
nor
obedience
but
for
his
own
ends
why
did
you
let
her
in
it
was
your
own
command
to
barr
none
from
him
besides
the
princess
sent
her

my
warrant

she
not
sir
tell
truth
i
do
not
use
to
lie

no
way

i
think

this
combat
has
undone
him
if
he
had
been
well
beaten
he
had
been
temperate
i
shall
never
see
him
handsome
again
till
he
have
a
staffe
yok
thorow
his
shoulders
or
an
arm
broken
with
a
bullet
i
am
trifled
with

know
it
as

know
thee
to
be
false
now
the
clap
comes

and
i
thank
heaven

read
her
letter
this
love
or
what
a
devil
it
is
i
know
not
begets
more
mischief
than
a
wake
i
had
rather
be
well
beaten
starv
or
lowsie
than
live
within
the
air
o
he
that
had
seen
this
brave
fellow
charge
through
a
grove
of
pikes
but
day
and
look
upon
him
now
will
believe
his
eyes
again
if
he
continue
thus
but
two
days
more
a
taylor
may
beat
him
with
one
hand
tied
behind
him
alas
she
would
be
at
liberty
and
there
be
a
thousand
reasons
thousands
that
will
which
if
she
knew
she
would
contentedly
be
where
she
is
and
bless
her
vertues
for
it
and
me
though
she
were
closer
she
would
good
man
indeed
she
would
then
good
sir
for
her
satisfaction
send
for
her
and
with
reason
make
her
know
why
she
must
live
thus
from
you
i
will
go
bring
her
to
me
bessus
two
and
a
very
welcome
both
some
stools
boy
and
reach
a
table
gentlemen
sword
pray
sit
without
more
complement
be
gone
child
i
have
been
curious
in
the
searching
of
you
because
i
understand
you
wise
and
valiant
persons
we
understand
our
selves
sir
nay
gentlemen
and
dear
friends
sword
no
complement
i
pray
but
to
the
cause
i
hang
upon
which
in
few
is
my
honour
you
can
not
hang
too
much
sir
for
your
honour
but
to
your
cause
be
wise
and
speak
truth
my
first
doubt
is
my
beating
by
my
prince
stay
there
a
little
sir
do
you
doubt
a
beating
or
have
you
had
a
beating
by
your
prince
gentlemen
sword
my
prince
has
beaten
me
brother
what
think
you
of
this
case
if
he
has
beaten
him
the
case
is
clear
if
he
have
beaten
him
i
grant
the
case
but
how
we
can
not
be
too
subtil
in
this
business
i
say
but
how
even
with
his
royal
hand
was
it
a
blow
of
love
or
indignation
was
twenty
blows
of
indignation
gentlemen
besides
two
blows
face
those
blows
face
have
made
a
new
cause
o
the
rest
were
but
an
horrible
rudeness
two
blows
face
and
given
by
a
worse
man
i
must
confess
as
the
say
had
turn
the
business
mark
me
brother
by
a
worse
man
but
being
by
his
prince
had
they
been
ten
and
those
ten
drawn
teeth
besides
the
hazard
of
his
nose
for
ever
all
this
had
been
but
favours
this
is
my
flat
opinion
which
die
in
the
king
may
do
much
captain
believe
it
for
had
he
crackt
your
scull
through
like
a
bottle
or
broke
a
rib
or
two
with
tossing
of
you
yet
you
had
lost
no
honour
this
is
strange
you
may
imagine
but
this
is
truth
now
captain
i
will
be
glad
to
embrace
it
gentlemen
but
how
far
may
he
strike
me
there
is
another
a
new
cause
rising
from
the
time
and
distance
in
which
i
will
deliver
my
opinion
he
may
strike
beat
or
cause
to
be
beaten
for
these
are
natural
to
man
your
prince
i
say
may
beat
you
so
far
forth
as
his
dominion
reacheth
that
for
the
distance
the
time
ten
miles
a
day
i
take
it
brother
you
err
is
fifteen
miles
a
day
his
stage
is
ten
his
beatings
are
fifteen
is
the
longest
but
we
subjects
must
be
subject
to
it
you
are
wise
and
vertuous
obedience
ever
makes
that
noble
use
o
to
which
i
dedicate
my
beaten
body
i
must
trouble
you
a
little
further
gentlemen
sword
no
trouble
at
all
to
us
sir
if
we
may
profit
your
understanding
we
are
bound
by
vertue
of
our
calling
to
utter
our
opinions
shortly
and
discreetly
my
sorest
business
is
i
have
been
kick
how
far
sir
not
to
flatter
my
self
in
it
all
over
my
sword
forc
but
not
lost
for
discreetly
i
rendred
it
to
save
that
imputation
it
shew
discretion
the
best
part
of
valour
brother
this
is
a
pretty
cause
pray
ponder
o
our
friend
here
has
been
kick
he
has
so
brother
sorely
he
saies
now
had
he
set
down
here
upon
the
meer
kick
had
been
cowardly
i
think
it
had
been
cowardly
indeed
but
our
friend
has
redeem
it
in
delivering
his
sword
without
compulsion
and
that
man
that
took
it
of
him
i
pronounce
a
weak
one
and
his
kicks
nullities
he
should
have
kick
him
after
the
delivering
which
is
the
confirmation
of
a
coward
brother
i
take
it
you
mistake
the
question
for
say
that
i
were
kick
i
must
not
say
so
nor
i
must
not
hear
it
spoke
by
the
tongue
of
man
you
kick
dear
brother
you
merry
but
put
the
case
i
were
kick
let
them
put
it
that
are
things
weary
of
their
lives
and
know
not
honour
put
the
case
you
were
kick
i
do
not
say
i
was
kickt
nor
no
silly
creature
that
wears
his
head
without
a
case
his
soul
in
a
you
kickt
dear
brother
nay
gentlemen
let
us
do
what
we
shall
do
truly
and
honest
l
y
good
sirs
to
the
question
why
then
i
say
suppose
your
boy
captain
the
boy
may
be
suppos
is
liable
a
foolish
forward
zeal
sir
in
my
friend
but
to
the
boy
suppose
the
boy
were
kickt
i
do
suppose
it
has
your
boy
a
sword
surely
no
i
pray
suppose
a
sword
too
i
do
suppose
it
you
grant
your
boy
was
then
by
no
means
captain
let
it
be
supposed
still
the
word
grant
makes
not
for
us
i
say
this
must
be
granted
this
must
be
granted
brother
i
this
must
be
granted
still
this
must
i
say
this
must
be
granted
i
give
me
the
must
again
brother
you
palter
i
will
not
hear
you
wasp
brother
i
say
you
palter
the
must
three
times
together
i
wear
as
sharp
steel
as
another
man
and
my
fox
bites
as
deep
musted
my
dear
brother
but
to
the
cause
again
nay
look
you
gentlemen
in
a
word
i
ha
done
a
tall
man
but
intemperate
is
great
pity
once
more
suppose
the
boy
kick
forward
and
being
thorowly
kick
laughs
at
the
kicker
so
much
for
us
proceed
and
in
this
beaten
scorn
as
i
may
call
it
delivers
up
his
weapon
where
lies
the
error
it
lies
beating
sir
i
found
it
four
dayes
since
the
error
and
a
sore
one
as
i
take
it
lies
in
the
thing
kicking
i
understand
that
well
is
so
indeed
sir
that
is
according
to
the
man
that
did
it
there
springs
a
new
branch
whose
was
the
foot
a
lords
the
cause
is
mighty
but
had
it
been
two
lords
and
both
had
kick
you
if
you
laugh
is
clear
i
did
laugh
but
how
will
that
help
me
gentlemen
yes
it
shall
help
you
if
you
laught
aloud
as
loud
as
a
kick
man
could
laugh
i
laught
sir
my
reason
now
the
valiant
man
is
known
by
suffering
and
contemning
you
have
enough
of
both
and
you
are
valiant
if
he
be
sure
he
has
been
kick
enough
for
that
brave
sufferance
you
speak
of
brother
consists
not
in
a
beating
and
away
but
in
a
cudgell
body
from
eighteen
to
eight
and
thirty
in
a
head
with
pots
of
all
size
degrees
stools
and
this
showes
a
valiant
man
then
i
am
valiant
as
valiant
as
the
proudest
for
these
are
all
familiar
things
to
me
familiar
as
my
sleep
or
want
of
money
all
my
whole
body
but
one
bruise
with
beating
i
think
i
have
been
cudgell
with
all
nations
and
almost
all
religions
embrace
him
brother
this
man
is
valiant
i
know
it
by
my
self

but
her
self
gob
you
welcome
sister
and
would
to
heaven
i
could
so
bid
you
by
another
name
if
you
above
love
not
such
sins
as
these
circle
my
heart
with
thoughts
as
cold
as
snow
to
quench
these
rising
flames
that
harbour
here
p
sir
does
it
please
you
i
should
speak
please
me
i
more
than
all
the
art
of
musick
can
thy
speech
doth
please
me
for
it
ever
sounds
as
thou
joyfull
unexpected
news
and
yet
it
is
not
fit
thou
shouldst
be
heard
i
pray
thee
think
so
be
it
so
i
will
am
i
the
first
that
ever
had
a
wrong
so
far
from
being
fit
to
have
redress
that
was
unfit
to
hear
it
i
will
back
to
prison
rather
than
disquiet
you
and
wait
till
it
be
fit
no
do
not
goe
for
i
will
hear
thee
with
a
serious
thought
i
have
collected
all
that
man
about
me
together
strongly
and
i
am
to
hear
thee
largely
but
i
do
beseech
thee
do
not
come
nearer
to
me
for
there
is
something
in
that
that
will
undoe
us
both
alas
sir
am
i
venome
yes
to
me
though
of
thy
self
i
think
thee
to
be
in
equall
degree
of
heat
or
cold
as
nature
can
make
yet
as
unsound
men
convert
the
sweetest
and
the
meats
into
diseases
so
shall
i
distemper
do
thee
i
pray
thee
draw
no
nearer
to
me
sir
this
is
that
i
would
i
am
of
late
shut
from
the
world
and
why
it
should
be
thus
is
all
i
wish
to
know
why
credit
me
credit
me
that
am
thy
brother
thy
loving
brother
that
there
is
a
cause
sufficient
yet
unfit
for
thee
to
know
that
might
undoe
thee
everlastingly
only
to
hear
wilt
thou
but
credit
this
by
heaven
is
true
believe
it
if
thou
canst
children
and
fools
are
ever
credulous
and
i
am
both
i
think
for
i
believe
if
you
dissemble
be
it
on
your
head
back
unto
my
prison
yet
i
might
be
kept
in
some
place
where
you
are
for
in
my
self
i
find
i
know
not
what
to
call
it
but
it
is
a
great
desire
to
see
you
often
fie
you
come
in
a
step
what
do
you
mean
dear
sister
do
not
so
alas
where
i
am
would
you
be
why
that
the
cause
you
are
imprison
that
you
may
not
be
where
i
am
then
i
must
indure
it
sir
heaven
keep
you
nay
you
shall
hear
the
case
in
short
and
when
thou
it
thou
wilt
blush
for
me
and
hang
thy
head
down
like
a
violet
full
of
the
mornings
dew
there
is
a
way
to
gain
thy
freedome
but
is
such
a
one
as
puts
thee
in
worse
bondage
and
i
know
thou
wouldst
encounter
fire
and
make
a
proof
whether
the
gods
have
care
of
innocence
rather
than
follow
it
know
that
i
have
lost
the
only
difference
betwixt
man
and
beast
my
reason
heaven
forbid
nay
is
gone
and
i
am
left
as
far
without
a
bound
as
the
wild
ocean
that
obeys
the
winds
each
sodain
passion
throwes
me
where
it
lists
and
overwhelms
all
that
oppose
my
will
i
have
beheld
thee
with
a
lustfull
eye
my
heart
is
set
on
wickedness
to
act
such
sins
with
thee
as
i
have
been
afraid
to
think
of
if
thou
consent
to
this
which
i
beseech
thee
do
not
thou
maist
gain
thy
liberty
and
yield
me
a
content
if
not
thy
dwelling
must
be
dark
and
close
where
i
may
never
see
thee
for
heaven
knows
that
laid
this
punishment
upon
my
pride
thy
sight
at
some
time
will
enforce
my
madness
to
make
a
start
to
thy
ravishing
now
spit
upon
me
and
call
all
reproaches
thou
canst
devise
together
and
at
once
against
me
for
i
am
a
sickness
as
killing
as
the
plague
ready
to
seize
thee
far
be
it
from
me
to
revile
the
king
but
it
is
true
that
i
shall
rather
choose
to
search
out
death
that
else
would
search
out
me
and
in
a
grave
sleep
with
my
innocence
than
welcome
such
a
sin
it
is
my
fate
to
these
cross
accidents
i
was
ordain
and
must
have
patience
and
but
that
my
eyes
have
more
of
woman
in
than
my
heart
i
would
not
weep
peace
enter
you
again
farwell
and
good
pray
for
me
thy
prayers
are
pure
that
i
may
find
a
death
however
soon
before
my
passions
grow
that
they
forget
what
i
desire
is
sin
for
thither
they
are
tending
if
that
happen
then
i
shall
force
thee
tho
thou
wert
a
virgin
by
vow
to
heaven
and
shall
pull
a
heap
of
strange
yet
uninvented
sin
upon
me
sir
i
will
pray
for
you
yet
you
shall
know
it
is
a
sullen
fate
that
governs
us
for
i
could
wish
as
heartily
as
you
i
were
no
sister
to
you
i
should
then
imbrace
your
lawfull
love
sooner
than
health
couldst
thou
affect
me
then
so
perfectly
that
as
it
is
i
ne
shall
sway
my
heart
to
like
another
then
i
curse
my
birth
must
this
be
added
to
my
miseries
that
thou
art
willing
too
is
there
no
stop
to
our
full
happiness
but
these
meer
sounds
brother
and
sister
there
is
nothing
else
but
these
alas
will
separate
us
more
than
twenty
worlds
betwixt
us
i
have
to
conquer
men
and
now
am
overthrown
only
by
words
brother
and
sister
where
have
those
words
dwelling
i
will
find
out
and
utterly
destroy
but
they
are
not
to
be
grasp
let
be
men
or
beasts
and
i
will
cut
from
the
earth
or
towns
and
i
will
raze
and
the
n
blow
up
let
be
seas
and
i
will
drink
off
and
yet
have
unquencht
fire
left
in
my
breast
let
be
any
thing
but
meerly
voice
but
is
not
in
the
power
of
any
force
or
policy
to
conquer
them
what
shall
we
do
shall
we
stand
firmly
here
and
gaze
our
eyes
out
would
i
could
do
so
but
i
shall
weep
out
mine
accursed
man
thou
thy
reason
at
too
dear
a
rate
for
thou
hast
all
thy
actions
bounded
in
with
curious
rules
when
every
beast
is
free
what
is
there
that
acknowledges
a
kindred
but
wretched
man
who
ever
saw
the
bull
fearfully
leave
the
heifer
that
he
because
they
had
one
dam
sir
i
disturb
you
and
my
self
too
better
i
were
gone
i
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
i
was
stay
we
will
love
just
as
becomes
our
births
no
otherwise
brothers
and
sisters
may
walk
hand
in
hand
together
so
will
we
come
nearer
is
there
any
hurt
in
this
i
hope
not
faith
there
is
none
at
all
and
tell
me
truly
now
is
there
not
one
you
love
above
me
no
by
heaven
why
yet
you
sent
unto
sister
true
but
for
another
for
the
truth
no
more
credit
thee
thou
canst
not
lie
thou
art
all
truth
but
is
there
nothing
else
that
we
may
do
but
only
walk
methinks
brothers
and
sisters
lawfully
may
kiss
and
so
they
may
so
will
we
and
kiss
again
too
we
were
too
scrupulous
and
foolish
but
we
will
be
so
no
more
if
you
have
any
mercy
let
me
go
to
prison
to
my
death
to
any
thing
i
feel
a
sin
growing
upon
my
blood
worse
than
all
these
hotter
than
yours
that
is
impossible
what
shou
we
do
flie
sir
for
heavens
sake
so
we
must
away
sin
grows
upon
us
more
by
this
delay
several
mardonius
lygones
sir
the
king
has
seen
your
commission
and
believes
it
and
freely
by
this
warrant
gives
you
power
to
visit
prince
tigranes
your
noble
master
i
thank
his
grace
and
kiss
his
hand
but
is
the
main
of
all
your
business
ended
in
this
i
have
another
but
a
worse
i
am
asham
it
is
a
business
you
serve
a
worthy
person
and
a
stranger
i
am
sure
you
are
you
may
imploy
me
if
you
please
without
your
purse
such
offices
should
ever
be
their
own
rewards
i
am
bound
to
your
nobleness
i
may
have
need
of
you
and
then
this
courtesie
if
it
be
any
is
not
ill
bestowed
but
may
i
civilly
desire
the
rest
i
shall
not
be
a
hurter
if
no
helper
sir
you
shall
know
i
have
lost
a
foolish
daughter
and
with
her
all
my
patience
pilfer
away
by
a
mean
captain
of
your
kings
stay
there
sir
if
he
have
reacht
the
noble
worth
of
captain
he
may
well
claim
a
worthy
gentlewoman
though
she
were
yours
and
noble
i
grant
all
that
too
but
this
wretched
fellow
reaches
no
further
than
the
empty
name
that
serves
to
feed
him
were
he
valiant
or
had
but
in
him
any
noble
nature
that
might
hereafter
promise
him
a
good
man
my
cares
were
so
much
lighter
and
my
grave
a
span
yet
from
me
i
confess
such
fellows
be
in
all
royal
camps
and
have
and
must
be
to
make
the
sin
of
coward
more
detested
in
the
mean
souldier
that
with
such
a
foil
sets
off
much
valour
by
description
i
should
now
guess
him
to
you
it
was
i
dare
almost
with
confidence
pronounce
it
is
such
a
scurvie
name
as
and
now
i
think
is
he
captain
do
you
call
him
believe
me
sir
you
have
a
misery
too
mighty
for
your
age
a
pox
upon
him
for
that
must
be
the
end
of
all
his
service
your
daughter
was
not
mad
sir
no
would
she
had
been
the
fault
had
had
more
credit
i
would
do
something
i
would
fain
counsel
you
but
to
what
i
know
not
he
so
below
a
beating
that
the
women
find
him
not
worthy
of
their
distaves
and
to
hang
him
were
to
cast
away
a
rope
he
such
an
airie
thin
unbodyed
coward
that
no
revenge
can
catch
him
tell
you
sir
and
tell
you
truth
this
rascal
fears
neither
god
nor
man
he
has
been
so
beaten
sufferance
has
made
him
wainscot
he
has
had
since
he
was
first
a
slave
at
least
three
hundred
daggers
set
in
head
as
little
boys
do
new
knives
in
hot
meat
there
not
a
rib
in
body
o
my
conscience
that
has
not
been
thrice
broken
with
dry
beating
and
now
his
sides
look
like
two
wicker
targets
every
way
bended
children
will
shortly
take
him
for
a
wall
and
set
their
in
his
forehead
he
is
of
so
base
a
sense
i
can
not
in
a
week
imagine
what
shall
be
done
to
him
sure
i
have
committed
some
great
sin
that
this
fellow
should
be
made
my
rod
i
would
see
him
but
i
shall
have
no
patience
is
no
great
matter
if
you
have
not
if
a
laming
of
him
or
such
a
toy
may
do
you
pleasure
sir
he
has
it
for
you
and
help
you
to
him
is
no
news
to
him
to
have
a
leg
broken
or
shoulder
out
with
being
turn
stones
like
a
tansie
draw
not
your
sword
if
you
love
it
for
on
my
conscience
his
head
will
break
it
we
use
him
wars
like
a
ram
to
shake
a
wall
withal
here
comes
the
very
person
of
him
do
as
you
shall
find
your
temper
i
must
leave
you
but
if
you
do
not
break
him
like
a
bisket
you
are
much
to
blame
sir
mar
bessus
the
sword
is
your
name
men

me
captain
bessus

ca
p
tain

a
rank

frozen
slave

well
though

have
done
nothing
but
what

good
madam
i
should
have
seen
you
o
good
sir
forgive
me

take
mony

you

help
you
to
liberal
clients
or
has
not
the
king
cast
you
off
yet
o
thou
vile
creature
whose
best
commendation
is
that
thou
art
a
young
whore
i
would
thy
mother
had
liv
to
see
this
or
rather
that
i
had
died
ere
i
had
seen
it
why
didst
not
make
me
acquainted
when
thou
wert
first
resolv
to
be
a
whore
i
would
have
seen
thy
hot
lust
satisfied
more
privately

would
have
kept
a
dancer
and
a
whole
consort
of
musicians
in
my
own
house
only
to
fiddle
thee
sir
i
was
never
whore

shouldst
be
carted

my
breed
strumpets

wish
to
have
you
know
i
scorn
to
get
a
whore
for

not
help
methinks
my
daughter
might
have
been
spar

enow
besides

not
prosper
but
she
innocent
as
morning
light
for
me
and
i
dare
swear
for
all
the
world
why
is
she
with
you
then
can
she
wait
on
you
better
than
your
man
has
she
a
gift
in
plucking
off
your
stockings
can
she
make
cawdles
well
or
cut
your
cornes
why
do
you
keep
her
with
you
for
a
queen
i
know
you
do
contemn
her
so
should
i
and
every
subject
else
think
much
at
it
let
think
much
but
is
more
firm
than
earth
thou
thy
queen
there
then
have
i
made
a
fair
hand
i
call
her
whore
if
i
shall
speak
now
as
her
father
i
can
not
chuse
but
greatly
rejoyce
that
she
shall
be
a
queen
but
if
i
shall
speak
to
you
as
a
she
were
more
fit
to
be
your
whore
get
you
about
your
business
to
now

talk
idlely
yes
sir
i
will
go
and
shall
she
be
a
queen

had
more
wit
than
her
old
father
when
she
ran
away
shall
she
be
queen
now
by
my
troth
is
fine
dance
out
of
all
measure
at
her
wedding

never
was
so
joyfull
in
all
my
life
that
i
remember
shall
she
be
a
queen
now
i
perceive
a
man
may
weep
for
joy
i
had
thought
they
had
lyed
that
said
so
lygones
come
my
dear
love
but
you
may
see
another
may
alter
that
again
urge
it
no
more
i
have
made
up
a
new
strong
constancy
not
to
be
shook
with
eyes
i
know
i
have
the
passions
of
a
man
but
if
i
meet
with
any
subject
that
should
hold
my
eyes
more
firmly
than
is
fit
think
of
thee
and
run
away
from
it
let
that
suffice
bacurius
his
three
gentlemen
without
to
speak
with
me
yes
sir
let
them
come
in
bessus
the
two
they
are
entred
sir
already
now
fellows
your
business
are
these
the
gentlemen
my
lord
i
have
made
bold
to
bring
these
gentlemen
my
friends
sword
along
with
me
i
am
afraid
fight
then
my
good
lord
i
will
not
your
lordship
is
much
mistaken
fear
not
lord
sir
i
am
sorry
i
ask
no
more
in
honour
gentlemen
you
hear
my
lord
is
sorry
not
that
i
have
beaten
you
but
beaten
one
that
will
be
beaten
one
whose
dull
body
will
require
a
laming
as
surfeits
do
the
diet
spring
and
fall
now
to
your
what
come
they
for
good
captain
it
seems
your
lordship
has
forgot
my
name
no
nor
your
nature
neither
though
they
are
things
fitter
i
must
confess
for
any
thing
than
my
remembrance
or
any
honest
mans
what
shall
these
billets
do
be
pil
up
in
my
your
lordship
holds
your
mirth
still
heaven
continue
it
but
for
these
gentlemen
they
come
to
swear
you
are
a
coward
spare
your
book
i
do
believe
it
your
lordship
still
draws
wide
they
come
to
vouch
under
their
valiant
hands
i
am
no
coward
that
would
be
a
show
indeed
worth
seeing
sirra
be
wise
and
take
mony
for
this
motion
travel
with
it
and
where
the
name
of
has
been
known
or
a
good
coward
stirring
yield
more
than
a
tilting
this
will
prove
more
beneficial
to
you
if
you
be
thrifty
than
your
captainship
and
more
natural
men
of
most
valiant
hands
is
this
true
it
is
so
most
renowned
is
somewhat
strange
lord
it
is
strange
yet
true
we
have
examined
from
your
lordships
foot
there
to
this
mans
head
the
nature
of
the
beatings
and
we
do
find
his
honour
is
come
off
clean
and
sufficient
this
as
our

sword

forget
their
fixt
decrees
and
hast
to
make
us
new
for
other
fortunes

thou
now
leave
me
heaven
put
into
your
bosome
temperate
thoughts
leave
you
though
i
fear
go
thou
art
honest
why
should
the
hasty
error
of
my
youth
be
so
unpardonable
to
draw
a
sin
helpless
upon
me
gobrias
there
is
the
king
now
it
is
ripe
draw
near
thou
guilty
man
that
art
the
authour
of
the
loathedst
crime
five
ages
have
brought
forth
and
hear
me
speak
curses
more
incurable
and
all
the
evils
mans
body
or
his
spirit
can
receive
be
with
thee
why
sir
do
you
curse
me
thus
why
do
i
curse
thee
if
there
be
a
man
subtil
in
curses
that
exceeds
the
rest
his
worst
wish
on
thee
thou
hast
broke
my
heart
how
sir
have
i
preserv
you
from
a
child
from
all
the
arrows
malice
or
ambition
could
shoot
at
you
and
have
i
this
for
my
pay
is
true
thou
didst
preserve
me
and
in
that
wert
crueller
than
hardned
murtherers
of
infants
and
their
mothers
thou
didst
save
me
only
till
thou
hadst
studied
out
a
way
how
to
destroy
me
cunningly
thy
self
this
was
a
curious
way
of
torturing
what
do
you
mean
thou
knowst
the
evils
thou
hast
done
to
me
dost
thou
remember
all
those
witching
letters
thou
unto
me
to
armenia
fill
with
the
praise
of
my
beloved
sister
where
thou
her
beauty
what
had
i
to
do
with
that
what
could
her
beauty
be
to
me
and
thou
didst
write
how
well
she
lov
me
dost
thou
remember
this
so
that
i
doted
something
before
i
saw
her
this
is
true
is
it
and
when
i
was
return
thou
knowst
thou
didst
pursue
it
till
thou
woundst
me
into
such
a
strange
and
affection
as
good
men
can
not
think
on
this
i
grant
i
think
i
was
the
cause
wert
thou
nay
more
i
think
thou
it
sir
i
hate
to
lie
as
i
love
heaven
and
honesty
i
did
it
was
my
meaning
be
thine
own
sad
judge
a
further
condemnation
will
not
need
prepare
thy
self
to
dy
why
sir
to
dy
why
shouldst
thou
live
was
ever
yet
offender
so
impudent
that
had
a
thought
of
mercy
after
confession
of
a
crime
like
this
get
out
i
can
not
where
thou
me
in
but
i
can
take
revenge
that
all
the
sweetness
left
for
me
now
is
the
time
hear
me
but
speak
no
yet
i
will
be
far
more
mercifull
than
thou
wert
to
me
thou
didst
steal
into
me
and
never
me
warning
so
much
time
as
i
give
thee
now
had
prevented
thee
for
ever
notwithstanding
all
thy
sins
if
thou
hast
hope
that
there
is
yet
a
prayer
to
save
thee
turn
and
speak
it
to
thy
self
sir
you
shall
know
your
sins
before
you
if
you
kill
me
i
will
not
stay
then
know
you
kill
your
father
how
you
kill
your
father
my
father
though
i
for
a
lie
made
out
of
fear
to
save
thy
stained
life
the
very
reverence
of
the
word
comes
cross
me
and
ties
mine
arm
down
i
will
tell
you
that
shall
heighten
you
again
i
am
thy
father
i
charge
thee
hear
me
if
it
should
be
so
as
is
most
false
and
that
i
should
be
found
a
bastard
issue
the
despised
fruit
of
lawless
lust
i
should
no
more
admire
all
my
wild
passions
but
another
truth
shall
be
wrung
from
thee
if
i
could
come
by
the
spirit
of
pain
it
should
be
poured
on
thee
till
thou
thy
self
more
full
of
lies
than
he
that
teaches
thee
arane

thee
about
i
come
to
speak
to
thee
thou
wicked
man

me
thou
tyrant

will
turn
to
thee

blotted
out
the
name
of
mother
as
thou
hast
thy
shame

hast
less
shame
than
any
thing
why
dost
thou
keep
my
daughter
in
a
prison
why
dost
thou
call
her
sister
and
do
this
cease
thy
strange
impudence
and
answer
quickly
if
thou
contemnest
me
this
will
ask
an
answer
and
have
it
help
me
gentle
guilt
dare
not
help
guilt
though
they
grow
together
in
doing
ill

at
the
punishment

sever
and
each
flies

noise
of
other

not
of
help

will
to
what

such
a
thing
as
if
it
be
a
truth

what
a
creature

hast
made
thy
self
that
didst
not
shame
to
do
what
i
must
blush
only
to
ask
thee

me
who
i
am
whose
son
i
am
without
all
circumstance
be
thou
as
hasty
as
my
sword

son

by
all
that

the
cause
of
all
my
strange
come
to
light
what
reverence
expectest
thou
from
a
child
to
bring
forth
which
thou
hast
offended
heaven
thy
husband
and
the
land
adulterous
witch
i
know
now
why
thou
wouldst
have
poyson
me
i
was
thy
lust
which
thou
wouldst
have
forgot
then
wicked
mother
of
my
sins
and
me
show
me
the
way
to
the
inheritance
i
have
by
thee
which
is
a
spacious
world
of
impious
acts
that
i
may
soon
possess
it
plagues
rot
thee
as
thou
and
such
diseases
as
use
to
pay
lust

thy
deed
you
do
not
know
why
you
curse
thus
too
well
you
are
a
pair
of
vipers
and
behold
the
serpent
you
have
got
there
is
no
beast
but
if
he
knew
it
has
a
pedigree
as
brave
as
mine
for
they
have
more
descents
and
i
am
every
way
as
beastly
got
as
far
without
the
compass
of
law
as
they
you
spend
your
rage
and
words
in
vain
and
rail
upon
a
guess
hear
us
a
little
no
i
will
never
hear
but
talk
away
my
breath
and
die
why
but
you
are
no
bastard
how
that
nor
child
of
mine
still
you
go
on
in
wonders
to
me
pray
you
be
more
patient
i
may
bring
comfort
to
you
i
will
kneel
and
hear
with
the
obedience
of
a
child
good
father
speak
i
do
acknowledge
you
so
you
bring
comfort
first
know
our
last
king
your
supposed
father
was
old
and
feeble
when
he
married
her
and
almost
all
the
land
thought
she
was
past
hope
of
issue
from
him
therefore
she
took
leave
to
play
the
whore
because
the
king
was
old
is
this
the
comfort
what
will
you
find
out
to
give
me
satisfaction
when
you
find
how
you
have
injur
me
let
fire
consume
me
if
ever
i
were
a
whore
these
starts
or
i
will
leave
you
wedded
to
despair
as
you
are
now
if
you
can
find
a
temper
my
breath
shall
be
a
pleasant
western
wind
that
cools
and
blasts
not
bring
it
out
good
father
lie
and
listen
here
as
reverently
as
to
an
angel
if
i
breath
too
loud
tell
me
for
i
would
be
as
still
as
night
our
king
i
say
was
old
and
this
our
queen
desir
to
bring
an
heir
but
yet
her
husband
she
thought
was
past
it
and
to
be
dishonest
i
think
she
would
not
if
she
would
have
been
the
truth
is
she
was
watcht
so
narrowly
and
had
so
slender
opportunities
she
hardly
could
have
been
but
yet
her
cunning
found
out
this
way
she
feign
her
self
with
child
and
posts
were
sent
in
hast
throughout
the
land
and
humble
thanks
was
given
in
every
church
and
prayers
were
made
for
her
safe
going
and
delivery
she
feign
now
to
grow
bigger
and
perceiv
this
hope
of
issue
made
her
fear
and
brought
a
far
more
large
respect
from
every
man
and
saw
her
power
increase
and
was
resolv
since
she
believ
she
could
not
indeed
at
least
she
would
be
thought
to
have
a
child
do
i
not
hear
it
well
nay
i
will
make
no
noise
at
all
but
pray
you
to
the
point
quickly
as
you
can
now
when
the
time
was
full
she
should
be
brought
to
bed
i
had
a
son
born
which
was
you
this
the
queen
hearing
of
mov
me
to
let
her
have
you
and
such
reasons
she
shewed
me
as
she
knew
would
tie
my
secrecie
she
swore
you
should
be
king
and
to
be
short
i
did
deliver
you
unto
her
and
pretended
you
were
dead
and
in
mine
own
house
kept
a
funeral
and
had
an
empty
coffin
put
in
earth
that
night
this
queen
feign
hastily
to
labour
and
by
a
pair
of
women
of
her
own
which
she
had
charm
she
made
the
world
believe
she
was
delivered
of
you
you
grew
up
as
the
kings
son
till
you
were
six
years
old
then
did
the
king
dye
and
did
leave
to
me
protection
of
the
realm
and
contrary
to
his
own
expectation
left
this
queen
truely
with
child
indeed
of
the
fair
princess
then
she
could
have
torn
her
hair
and
did
alone
to
me
yet
durst
not
speak
in
publick
for
she
knew
she
should
be
found
a
traytor
and
her
tale
would
have
been
thought
madness
or
any
thing
rather
than
truth
this
was
the
only
cause
why
she
did
seek
to
poyson
you
and
i
to
keep
you
safe
and
this
the
reason
why
i
sought
to
kindle
some
sparks
of
love
in
you
to
fair
that
she
might
get
part
of
her
right
again
and
have
you
made
an
end
now
is
this
all
if
not
i
will
be
still
till
i
be
aged
till
all
my
hairs
be
silver
this
is
all
and
is
it
true
say
you
too
madam
yes
heaven
knows
it
is
most
true
then
is
not
my
sister
no
but
can
you
prove
this
if
you
will
give
consent
else
who
dares
go
about
it
give
consent
why
i
will
have
all
that
know
it
rackt
to
get
this
from
all
that
wait
without
come
in
what
ere
you
be

mardonius
and
sir
the

has
seene
your

freely
by
this
warrant
gives
you
leave
to
visit
prince
your
noble
master
i
thanke
his
grace
and
kisse
his
hands
but
is
the
maine
of
all
your
businesse
ended
in
this
i
have
another
but
a
worse
i
am
asham
it
is
a
you
serve
a
worthy
person
and
a
stranger
i
am
sure
you
are
you
may
imploy
mee
if
you
please
without
your
purse
such
officers
should
ever
be
their
owne
rewards
i
am
bound
to
your
noblenesse
i
may
have
neede
of
you
and
then
this
curtesie
if
it
be
any
is
not
ill
bestowed
but
may
i
civilly
desire
the
rest
i
shall
not
be
a
hurter
if
no
helper
sir
you
shall
know
i
have
lost
a
foolish
daughter
and
with
her
all
my
patience
pilferd
away
by
a
meane
captaine
of
your
kings
stay
there
sir
if
he
have
reacht
the
noble
worth
of
captaine
he
may
well
claime
a
worthy
gentlewoman
though
shee
were
yours
and
noble
i
grant
all
that
too
but
this
wretched
fellow
reaches
no
further
then
the
emptie
name
that
serves
to
feede
him
were
he
valiant
or
had
but
in
him
any
noble
nature
that
might
hereafter
promise
him
a
good
man
my
cares
were
something
lighter
and
my
grave
a
span
yet
from
me
i
confesse
such
fellowes
be
in
all
royall
campes
and
have
and
must
be
to
make
the
sinne
of
coward
more
detested
in
the
meane
souldier
that
with
such
a
foyle
sets
of
much
valour
by
description
i
should
now
guesse
him
to
you
it
was
i
dare
almost
with
confidence
pronounce
it
tis
such
a
scurvy
name
as
and
now
i
thinke
tis
hee
captaine
doe
you
call
him
beleeve
me
sir
you
have
a
miserie
too
mighty
for
your
age
a
pox
upon
him
for
that
must
be
the
end
of
all
his
service
your
daughter
was
not
mad
sir
no
would
shee
had
beene
the
fault
had
had
more
credit
i
would
doe
something
i
would
faine
counsell
you
but
to
what
i
know
not
hee
so
below
a
beating
that
the
women
find
him
not
worthy
of
their
distaves
and
to
hang
him
were
to
cast
away
a
rope
hee
such
an
ayrie
thin
unbodied
coward
that
no
revenge
can
catch
him
he
tell
you
sir
and
tell
you
truth
this
rascall
feares
neither
god
nor
man
has
beene
so
beaten
sufferance

made
him
wanscote

has
had
since
hee
was
first
a
slave
at
least
three
hundred
daggers
set
in
his
head
as
little
boyes
doe
new
knives
in
hot
meat
ther
not
a
rib
in
bodie
a
my
conscience
that
has
not
beene
thrice
broken
with
drie
beating
and
now
his
sides
looke
like
to
wicker
targets
everie
way
bended
children

shortly
take
him
for
a
wall
and

of
so
low
a
sence
i
can
not

committed
some
great
sinne

strange
fellow

be
made

see
him
but

shall
have
no

father
he
lie
artd
listen
here
as
reverentlie
as
to
an
angell
if
i
breathe
too
loude
tell
me
for
i
would
be
as
still
as
night
our
king
i
say
was
old
and
this
our
queene
desired
to
bring
an
heire
but
yet
her
husband
shee
thought
was
past
it
and
to
be
dishonest
i
thinke
shee
would
not
if
shee
would
have
beene
the
truth
is
shee
was
watcht
so
narrowlie
and
had
so
slender
opportunitie
shee
hardly
could
have
beene
but
yet
her
cunning
found
out
this
way
shee
fain
her
selfe
with
child
and
postes
were
sent
in
haste
throughout
the
land
and
god
was
humbly
thankt
in
every
church
that
so
had
blest
the
queen
and
prayers
were
made
for
her
safe
going
and
deliverie
shee
fain
now
to
grow
bigger
and
this
hope
of
issue
made
her
feard
and
brought
a
farre
more
large
respect
from
everie
man
and
saw
her
power
increase
and
was
resolv
since
shee
believ
shee
could
not
indeede
at
least
shee
would
be
thought
to
have
a
child
doe
i
not
heare
it
well
nay
i
will
make
no
noise
at
all
but
pray
you
to
the
point
quicke
as
you
can
now
when
the
time
was
full
shee
should
be
brought
abed
i
had
a
sonne
borne
which
was
you
this
the
queene
hearing
of
mov
me
to
let
her
have
you
and
such
reasons
shee
shewed
me
as
shee
knew
would
tie
my
secresie
shee
sware
you
should
be
king
and
to
be
short
i
did
deliver
you
unto
her
and
pretended
you
were
dead
and
in
mine
owne
house
kept
a
funerall
and
had
an
emptie
coffin
put
in
earth
that
night
the
queene
fain
hastilie
to
labour
and
by
a
paire
of
women
of
her
owne
which
shee
had
charm
shee
made
the
world
believe
shee
was
deliver
of
you
you
grew
up
as
the
kings
sonne
till
you
were
six
yeere
olde
then
did
the
king
die
and
did
leave
to
me
protection
of
the
realme
and
contrarie
to
his
owne
expectation
left
this
queene
truly
with
childe
indeed
of
the
faire
princesse
then
shee
could
have
torne
her
heire
and
did
alone
to
me
yet
durst
not
speake
in
publike
for
shee
knew
shee
should
be
found
a
traytor
and
her
talke
would
have
beene
thought
madnesse
or
any
thing
rather
then
truth
this
was
the
onely
cause
why
shee
did
seeke
to
poyson
you
and
i
to
keepe
you
safe
and
this
the
reason
why
i
sought
to
kindle
some
sparke
of
love
in
you
to
faire
that
shee
might
get
part
of
her
right
agen
and
have
you
made
an
end
now
is
this
all
if
not
i
will
be
still
till
i
am
aged
till
all
my
heires
are
silver
this
is
all
and
is
it
true
say
you
maddam
yes
god
knowes
it
is
most
true
then
is
not
my
sister
no
but
can
you
prove
this
if
you
will
give
consent
else
who
dare
goe
about
it
give
consent

i
will
have
them
all
that
know
it
rackt
to
get
this
from
