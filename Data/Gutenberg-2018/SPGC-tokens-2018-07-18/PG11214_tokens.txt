frank
webb
preface
by
harriet
beecher
stowe
to
the
lady
noel
byron
this
book
is
by
her
kind
permission
most
affectionately
inscribed
with
profound
respect
by
her
grateful
friend
the
author
preface
the
book
which
now
appears
before
the
public
may
be
of
interest
in
relation
to
a
question
which
the
late
agitation
of
the
subject
of
slavery
has
raised
in
many
thoughtful
minds
are
the
race
at
present
held
as
slaves
capable
of
freedom
and
progress
the
author
is
a
coloured
young
man
born
and
reared
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
this
city
standing
as
it
does
on
the
frontier
between
free
and
slave
territory
has
accumulated
naturally
a
large
population
of
the
mixed
and
african
race
being
one
of
the
nearest
free
cities
of
any
considerable
size
to
the
slave
territory
it
has
naturally
been
a
resort
of
escaping
fugitives
or
of
emancipated
slaves
in
this
city
they
form
a
large
class
have
increased
in
numbers
wealth
and
standing
they
constitute
a
peculiar
society
of
their
own
presenting
many
social
peculiarities
worthy
of
interest
and
attention
the
representations
of
their
positions
as
to
wealth
and
education
are
reliable
the
incidents
related
are
mostly
true
ones
woven
together
by
a
slight
web
of
fiction
the
scenes
of
the
mob
describe
incidents
of
a
peculiar
stage
of
excitement
which
existed
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
years
ago
when
the
first
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
developed
an
intense
form
of
opposition
to
the
free
coloured
people
southern
influence
at
that
time
stimulated
scenes
of
mob
violence
in
several
northern
cities
where
the
discussion
was
attempted
by
prompt
undaunted
resistance
however
this
spirit
was
subdued
and
the
right
of
free
inquiry
established
so
that
discussion
of
the
question
so
far
from
being
dangerous
in
free
states
is
now
begun
to
be
allowed
in
the
slave
states
and
there
are
some
subjects
the
mere
discussion
of
which
is
a
the
author
takes
pleasure
in
recommending
this
simple
and
story
to
the
attention
and
interest
of
the
friends
of
progress
and
humanity
in
england
signed
stowe
andover
from
lord
brougham
i
have
been
requested
by
one
who
has
long
known
the
deep
interest
i
have
ever
taken
in
the
cause
of
freedom
and
in
the
elevation
of
the
coloured
race
to
supply
a
few
lines
of
introduction
to
webb
book
it
was
the
intention
of
harriet
beecher
stowe
to
introduce
this
work
to
the
british
public
but
i
am
truly
sorry
to
learn
that
a
severe
domestic
affliction
since
her
return
to
america
has
postponed
the
fulfilment
of
her
promise
i
am
however
able
to
state
her
opinion
of
the
book
expressed
in
a
letter
to
one
of
her
friends
she
says
there
are
points
in
the
book
of
which
i
think
very
highly
the
style
is
simple
and
unambitious
the
characters
most
of
them
faithfully
drawn
from
real
life
are
quite
fresh
and
the
incident
which
is
also
much
of
it
fact
is
often
deeply
interesting
i
shall
do
what
i
can
with
the
preface
i
would
not
do
as
much
unless
i
thought
the
book
of
worth
it
shows
what
i
long
have
wanted
to
show
what
the
people
of
colour
do
and
what
they
can
do
in
spite
of
all
social
obstacles
i
hope
and
trust
that
webb
book
will
meet
with
all
the
success
to
which
its
own
merit
and
the
great
interest
of
the
subject
so
well
entitle
it
on
this
stowe
authority
is
naturally
of
the
greatest
weight
and
i
can
only
lament
that
this
prefatory
notice
does
not
come
accompanied
with
her
further
remarks
and
illustrations
since
the
above
was
written
the
preface
by
stowe
has
been
received
it
was
deemed
best
however
to
still
retain
the
introduction
so
kindly
given
by
lord
brougham
whose
deep
interest
in
the
freedom
and
welfare
of
the
african
race
none
feel
more
grateful
for
than
does

the

in
which

is
introduced
to
a
family
of
peculiar
construction
it
was
at
the
close
of
an
afternoon
in
may
that
a
party
might
have
been
seen
gathered
around
a
table
covered
with
all
those
delicacies
that
in
the
household
of
a
rich
southern
planter
are
regarded
as
almost
necessaries
of
life
in
the
centre
stood
a
dish
of
ripe
strawberries
their
plump
red
sides
peeping
through
the
covering
of
white
sugar
that
had
been
plentifully
sprinkled
over
them
geeche
limes
almost
drowned
in
their
own
rich
syrup
temptingly
displayed
their
forms
just
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
that
contained
them
opposite
and
as
if
to
divert
the
gaze
from
lingering
too
long
over
their
luscious
beauty
was
a
dish
of
peaches
preserved
in
brandy
a
article
in
a
southern
catalogues
of
sweets
a
silver
basket
filled
with
a
variety
of
cakes
was
in
close
proximity
to
a
plate
of
which
were
piled
upon
it
like
a
mountain
and
from
the
brown
tops
of
which
trickled
tiny
rivulets
of
butter
all
these
dainties
mingling
their
various
odours
with
the
aroma
of
the
tea
and
fine
old
java
that
came
steaming
forth
from
the
richly
chased
silver
pots
could
not
fail
to
produce
a
very
appetising
effect
there
was
nothing
about
garie
the
gentleman
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
to
attract
more
than
ordinary
attention
he
had
the
ease
of
manner
usual
with
persons
whose
education
and
associations
have
been
of
a
highly
refined
character
and
his
countenance
on
the
whole
was
pleasing
and
indicative
of
habitual
good
temper
opposite
to
him
and
presiding
at
the
sat
a
lady
of
marked
beauty
the
first
thing
that
would
have
attracted
attention
on
seeing
her
were
her
gloriously
dark
eyes
they
were
not
entirely
black
but
of
that
seemingly
changeful
hue
so
often
met
with
in
persons
of
african
extraction
which
deepens
and
lightens
with
every
varying
emotion
hers
wore
a
subdued
expression
that
sank
into
the
heart
and
at
once
riveted
those
who
saw
her
her
hair
of
jetty
black
was
arranged
in
braids
and
through
her
complexion
the
faintest
tinge
of
carmine
was
visible
as
she
turned
to
take
her
little
girl
from
the
arms
of
the
servant
she
displayed
a
fine
profile
and
perfectly
moulded
form
no
wonder
that
ten
years
before
when
she
was
placed
upon
the
at
savanah
she
had
brought
so
high
a
price
garie
had
paid
two
thousand
dollars
for
her
and
was
the
envy
of
all
the
young
bucks
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
competed
with
him
at
the
sale
captivated
by
her
beauty
he
had
esteemed
himself
fortunate
in
becoming
her
purchaser
and
as
time
developed
the
goodness
of
her
heart
and
her
mind
enlarged
through
the
instructions
he
assiduously
gave
her
he
found
the
connection
that
might
have
been
productive
of
many
evils
had
proved
a
boon
to
both
for
whilst
the
astonishing
progress
she
made
in
her
education
proved
her
worthy
of
the
pains
he
took
to
instruct
her
she
returned
threefold
the
tenderness
and
affection
he
lavished
upon
her
the
little
girl
in
her
arms
and
the
boy
at
her
side
showed
no
trace
whatever
of
african
origin
the
girl
had
the
chestnut
hair
and
blue
eyes
of
her
father
but
the
boy
had
inherited
the
black
hair
and
dark
eyes
of
his
mother
the
critically
learned
in
such
matters
knowing
his
parentage
might
have
imagined
they
could
detect
the
evidence
of
his
mother
race
by
the
slightly
expression
of
his
eyes
and
the
rather
african
fulness
of
his
lips
but
the
casual
observer
would
have
passed
him
by
without
dreaming
that
a
drop
of
negro
blood
coursed
through
his
veins
his
face
was
expressive
of
much
intelligence
and
he
now
seemed
to
listen
with
an
earnest
interest
to
the
conversation
that
was
going
on
between
his
father
and
a
gentleman
who
sat
beside
him
and
so
you
say
winston
that
they
never
suspected
you
were
coloured
i
do
think
they
had
the
remotest
idea
of
such
a
thing
at
least
if
they
did
they
must
have
conquered
their
prejudices
most
effectually
for
they
treated
me
with
the
most
distinguished
consideration
old
priestly
was
like
a
father
to
me
and
as
for
his
daughter
clara
and
her
aunt
they
were
politeness
embodied
the
old
gentleman
was
so
much
immersed
in
business
that
he
was
unable
to
bestow
much
attention
upon
me
so
he
turned
me
over
to
miss
clara
to
be
shown
the
lions
we
went
to
the
opera
the
theatre
to
museums
concerts
and
i
ca
tell
where
all
the
sunday
before
i
left
i
accompanied
her
to
church
and
after
service
as
we
were
coming
out
she
introduced
me
to
miss
van
cote
and
her
mamma
van
cote
was
kind
enough
to
invite
me
to
her
grand
ball
and
did
you
go
interrupted
garie
of
course
i
did
and
what
is
more
as
old
priestly
has
given
up
balls
he
begged
me
to
escort
clara
and
her
aunt
well
winston
that
is
too
rich
exclaimed
garie
slapping
his
hand
on
the
table
and
laughing
till
he
was
red
in
the
face
too
good
by
jove
oh
i
ca
keep
that
i
must
write
to
them
and
say
i
forgot
to
mention
in
my
note
of
introduction
that
you
were
a
coloured
gentleman
the
old
man
will
swear
till
everything
turns
blue
and
as
for
clara
what
will
become
of
her
a
belle
escorted
to
church
and
to
balls
by
a
coloured
gentleman
here
garie
indulged
in
another
burst
of
laughter
so
and
merry
that
the
contagion
spread
even
to
the
little
girl
in
garie
arms
who
almost
choked
herself
with
the
tea
her
mother
was
giving
her
and
who
had
to
be
hustled
and
shaken
for
some
time
before
she
could
be
brought
round
again
it
will
be
a
great
triumph
for
me
said
garie
the
old
man
prides
himself
on
being
able
to
detect
evidences
of
the
least
drop
of
african
blood
in
any
one
and
makes
long
speeches
about
the
natural
antipathy
of
the
to
anything
with
a
drop
of
negro
blood
in
its
veins
oh
i
shall
write
him
a
glorious
letter
expressing
my
pleasure
at
his
great
change
of
sentiment
and
my
admiration
of
the
fearless
manner
in
which
he
displays
his
contempt
for
public
opinion
how
he
will
stare
i
fancy
i
see
him
now
with
his
hair
almost
on
end
with
disgust
it
will
do
him
good
it
will
convince
him
i
hope
that
a
man
can
be
a
gentleman
even
though
he
has
african
blood
in
his
veins
i
have
had
a
series
of
quarrels
with
him
continued
garie
i
think
he
had
his
eye
on
me
for
miss
clara
and
that
makes
him
particularly
fierce
about
my
present
connection
he
rather
presumes
on
his
former
great
intimacy
with
my
father
and
undertakes
to
lecture
me
occasionally
when
opportunity
is
afforded
he
was
greatly
scandalized
at
my
speaking
of
emily
as
my
wife
and
seemed
to
think
me
cracked
because
i
talked
of
endeavouring
to
procure
a
governess
for
my
children
or
of
sending
them
abroad
to
be
educated
he
has
a
holy
horror
of
everything
approaching
to
amalgamation
and
of
all
the
men
i
ever
met
cherishes
the
most
unchristian
prejudice
against
coloured
people
he
says
the
existence
of
a
gentleman
with
african
blood
in
his
veins
is
a
moral
and
physical
impossibility
and
that
by
no
exertion
can
anything
be
made
of
that
description
of
people
he
is
connected
with
a
society
for
the
deportation
of
free
coloured
people
and
thinks
they
ought
to
be
all
sent
to
africa
unless
they
are
willing
to
become
the
property
of
some
good
master
oh
yes
it
is
quite
a
hobby
of
his
here
interposed
winston
he
makes
lengthy
speeches
on
the
subject
and
has
published
two
of
them
in
pamphlet
form
have
you
seen
them
yes
he
sent
them
to
me
i
tried
to
get
through
one
of
them
but
it
was
too
heavy
i
had
to
give
it
up
besides
i
had
no
patience
with
them
they
abounded
in
respecting
the
free
coloured
people
why
even
here
in
the
slave
states
in
the
cities
of
savanah
and
charleston
they
are
much
better
situated
than
he
describes
them
to
be
in
new
york
and
since
they
can
and
do
prosper
here
where
they
have
such
tremendous
difficulties
to
encounter
i
know
they
can
not
be
in
the
condition
he
paints
in
a
state
where
they
are
relieved
from
many
of
the
oppressions
they
labour
under
here
and
on
questioning
him
on
the
subject
i
found
he
was
entirely
unacquainted
with
coloured
people
profoundly
ignorant
as
to
the
real
facts
of
their
case
he
had
never
been
within
a
coloured
church
or
school
did
not
even
know
that
they
had
a
literary
society
amongst
them
positively
i
living
down
here
in
georgia
knew
more
about
the
character
and
condition
of
the
coloured
people
of
the
northern
states
than
he
who
lived
right
in
the
midst
of
them
would
you
believe
that
beyond
their
laundress
and
a
drunken
negro
that
they
occasionally
employed
to
do
odd
jobs
for
them
they
were
actually
unacquainted
with
any
coloured
people
and
how
unjust
was
it
for
him
to
form
his
opinion
respecting
a
class
numbering
over
twenty
thousand
in
his
own
state
from
the
two
individuals
i
have
mentioned
and
the
negro
loafers
he
occasionally
saw
in
the
streets
it
is
truly
unfortunate
rejoined
winston
for
he
covers
his
prejudices
with
such
a
pretended
regard
for
the
coloured
people
that
a
person
would
be
the
more
readily
led
to
believe
his
statements
respecting
them
to
be
correct
and
he
is
really
so
positive
about
it
and
apparently
go
deaf
to
all
argument
that
i
did
not
discuss
the
subject
with
him
to
any
extent
he
was
so
very
kind
to
me
that
i
did
not
want
to
run
a
tilt
against
his
favourite
opinions
you
wrote
me
he
gave
you
letters
to
philadelphia
was
there
one
amongst
them
to
the
mortons
yes
they
were
very
civil
and
invited
me
to
a
grand
dinner
they
gave
to
the
belgian
charge
i
also
met
there
one
or
two
scions
of
the
first
families
of
virginia
the
belgian
minister
did
not
seem
to
be
aware
that
slavery
is
a
tabooed
subject
in
polite
circles
and
he
was
continually
bringing
it
forward
until
slaves
slavery
and
black
people
in
general
became
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
relieved
by
occasional
discussion
upon
some
new
book
or
pictures
and
remarks
in
praise
of
the
viands
before
us
a
very
amusing
thing
occurred
during
dinner
a
little
coloured
boy
who
was
assisting
at
the
table
seemed
to
take
uncommon
interest
in
the
conversation
an
animated
discussion
had
arisen
as
to
the
antiquity
of
the
use
of
salad
one
party
maintaining
that
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
english
poets
had
mentioned
it
in
a
poem
and
the
other
as
stoutly
denying
it
at
last
a
reverend
gentleman
whose
remarks
respecting
the
intelligence
of
the
children
of
ham
had
been
particularly
disparaging
asserted
that
nowhere
in
chaucer
spencer
nor
any
of
the
old
english
poets
could
anything
relating
to
it
be
found
at
this
the
little
waiter
became
so
excited
that
he
could
no
longer
contain
himself
and
despite
the
frowns
and
nods
of
our
hostess
exclaimed
it
can
it
in
chaucer
here
he
continued
taking
out
a
book
from
the
is
the
very
volume
and
turning
over
the
leaves
he
pointed
out
the
passage
to
the
great
chagrin
of
the
reverend
gentleman
and
to
the
amusement
of
the
guests
the
belgian
minister
enjoyed
it
immensely
said
he
child
of
ham
know
more
than
the
child
of
shem
dis
time
whereupon
morton
rejoined
that
in
this
case
it
was
not
so
wonderful
owing
to
the
frequent
and
intimate
relations
into
which
ham
and
salad
were
brought
and
with
this
joke
the
subject
was
dismissed
i
ca
say
i
was
particularly
sorry
when
the
company
broke
up
footnote
see
chaucer
flower
and
the
leaf
oh
george
never
mind
the
white
people
here
interposed
garie
never
mind
them
tell
us
about
the
coloured
folks
they
are
the
ones
i
take
the
most
interest
in
we
were
so
delighted
with
your
letters
and
so
glad
that
you
found
ellis
tell
us
all
about
that
oh
is
a
long
story
em
and
ca
be
told
in
a
minute
it
would
take
the
whole
evening
to
relate
it
all
look
at
the
children
my
dear
they
are
half
asleep
said
garie
call
nurse
and
see
them
safe
into
bed
and
when
you
come
back
we
will
have
the
whole
story
very
well
replied
she
rising
and
calling
the
nurse
now
remember
george
you
are
not
to
begin
until
i
return
for
i
should
be
quite
vexed
to
lose
a
word
oh
go
on
with
the
children
my
dear
i
guarantee
he
shall
not
say
a
word
on
the
subject
till
you
come
back
with
this
assurance
garie
left
the
room
playfully
shaking
her
finger
at
them
as
she
went
out
exclaiming
not
a
word
remember
now
not
a
word
after
she
left
them
garie
remarked
i
have
not
seen
em
as
happy
as
she
is
this
afternoon
for
some
time
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
her
lately
she
scarcely
ever
smiles
now
and
yet
she
used
to
be
the
most
cheerful
creature
in
the
world
i
wish
i
knew
what
is
the
matter
with
her
sometimes
i
am
quite
distressed
about
her
she
goes
about
the
house
looking
so
lost
and
gloomy
and
does
not
seem
to
take
the
least
interest
in
anything
you
saw
continued
he
how
silent
she
has
been
all
tea
time
and
yet
she
has
been
more
interested
in
what
you
have
been
saying
than
in
anything
that
has
transpired
for
months
well
i
suppose
women
will
be
so
sometimes
he
concluded
applying
himself
to
the
warm
cakes
that
had
just
been
set
upon
the
table
perhaps
she
is
not
well
suggested
winston
i
think
she
looks
a
little
pale
well
possibly
you
may
be
right
but
i
trust
it
is
only
a
temporary
lowness
of
spirits
or
something
of
that
kind
maybe
she
will
get
over
it
in
a
day
or
two
and
with
this
remark
the
conversation
dropped
and
the
gentlemen
proceeded
to
the
demolition
of
the
sweetmeats
before
them
and
now
my
reader
whilst
they
are
finishing
their
meal
i
will
relate
to
you
who
winston
is
and
how
he
came
to
be
so
familiarly
seated
at
garie
table
winston
had
been
a
slave
yes
that
gentleman
seated
near
garie
and
losing
nothing
by
the
comparison
that
their
proximity
would
suggest
had
been
fifteen
years
before
sold
on
the
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
savanah
had
been
made
to
jump
show
his
teeth
shout
to
test
his
lungs
and
had
been
handled
and
examined
by
professed
negro
traders
and
amateur
buyers
with
less
gentleness
and
commiseration
than
every
humane
man
would
feel
for
a
horse
or
an
ox
now
do
not
doubt
me
i
mean
that
very
gentleman
whose
polished
manners
and
irreproachable
appearance
might
have
led
you
to
suppose
him
descended
from
a
long
line
of
illustrious
ancestors
yes
he
was
the
offspring
of
a
mulatto
by
her
master
he
who
was
now
clothed
in
fine
linen
had
once
rejoiced
in
a
tow
shirt
that
scarcely
covered
his
nakedness
and
had
sustained
life
on
a
peck
of
corn
a
week
receiving
the
while
kicks
and
curses
from
a
tyrannical
overseer
the
death
of
his
master
had
brought
him
to
the
from
which
both
he
and
his
mother
were
sold
to
separate
owners
there
they
took
their
last
embrace
of
each
other
the
mother
tearless
but
the
boy
with
all
the
wildest
manifestations
of
grief
his
purchaser
was
a
cotton
broker
from
new
orleans
a
kind
old
man
who
took
a
fancy
to
the
boy
looks
and
pitied
him
for
his
unfortunate
separation
from
his
mother
after
paying
for
his
new
purchase
he
drew
him
aside
and
said
in
a
kind
tone
come
my
little
man
stop
crying
my
boys
never
cry
if
you
behave
yourself
you
shall
have
fine
times
with
me
stop
crying
now
and
come
with
me
i
am
going
to
buy
you
a
new
suit
of
clothes
i
do
want
new
clothes
i
want
my
mammy
exclaimed
the
child
with
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
oh
dear
me
said
the
fussy
old
gentleman
why
ca
you
stop
i
want
to
hear
you
cry
here
continued
he
fumbling
in
his
pocket
a
picayune
will
that
buy
mother
back
said
the
child
brightening
up
no
no
my
little
man
not
quite
i
wish
it
would
i
purchase
the
old
woman
but
i
ca
i
not
able
to
spare
the
money
then
i
do
want
it
cried
the
boy
throwing
the
money
on
the
ground
if
it
wo
buy
mammy
i
do
want
it
i
want
my
mammy
and
nothing
else
at
length
by
much
kind
language
and
by
the
prospect
of
many
fabulous
events
to
occur
hereafter
invented
at
the
moment
by
the
old
gentleman
the
boy
was
coaxed
into
a
more
quiescent
state
and
trudged
along
in
the
rear
of
moyese
that
was
the
name
of
his
purchaser
to
be
fitted
with
the
new
suit
of
clothes
the
next
morning
they
started
by
the
stage
for
augusta
george
seated
on
the
box
with
the
driver
found
much
to
amuse
him
and
the
driver
merry
chat
and
great
admiration
of
george
new
and
suit
went
a
great
way
towards
reconciling
that
young
gentleman
to
his
new
situation
in
a
few
days
they
arrived
in
new
orleans
there
under
the
kind
care
of
moyese
he
began
to
exhibit
great
signs
of
intelligence
the
atmosphere
into
which
he
was
now
thrown
the
kindness
of
which
he
was
hourly
the
recipient
called
into
vigour
abilities
that
would
have
been
stifled
for
ever
beneath
the
blighting
influences
that
surrounded
him
under
his
former
master
the
old
gentleman
had
him
taught
to
read
and
write
and
his
aptness
was
such
as
to
highly
gratify
the
kind
old
soul
in
course
of
time
the
temporary
absence
of
an
clerk
caused
george
services
to
be
required
at
the
office
for
a
few
days
as
here
he
made
himself
so
useful
as
to
induce
moyese
to
keep
him
there
permanently
after
this
he
went
through
all
the
grades
from
up
to
which
post
he
filled
to
the
full
satisfaction
of
his
employer
his
manners
and
person
improved
with
his
circumstances
and
at
the
time
he
occupied
the
desk
no
one
would
have
suspected
him
to
be
a
slave
and
few
who
did
not
know
his
history
would
have
dreamed
that
he
had
a
drop
of
african
blood
in
his
veins
he
was
unremitting
in
his
attention
to
the
duties
of
his
station
and
gained
by
his
assiduity
and
amiable
deportment
the
highest
regard
of
his
employer
a
week
before
a
certain
moyese
sat
musing
over
some
presents
that
had
just
been
sent
home
and
which
he
was
on
the
morrow
to
distribute
amongst
his
nephews
and
nieces
why
bless
me
he
suddenly
exclaimed
turning
them
over
why
i
entirely
forgotten
george
that
will
never
do
i
must
get
something
for
him
what
shall
it
be
he
has
a
fine
watch
and
i
gave
him
a
pin
and
ring
last
year
i
really
do
know
what
will
be
suitable
and
he
sat
for
some
time
rubbing
his
chin
apparently
in
deep
deliberation
yes
i
do
it
he
exclaimed
starting
up
i
do
it
he
has
been
a
faithful
fellow
and
deserves
it
i
make
him
a
present
of
himself
now
how
strange
it
is
i
never
thought
of
that
before
it
just
the
thing
how
surprised
and
delighted
he
will
be
and
the
old
gentleman
laughed
a
low
gentle
happy
laugh
that
had
in
it
so
little
of
selfish
pleasure
that
had
you
only
heard
him
you
must
have
loved
him
for
it
having
made
up
his
mind
to
surprise
george
in
this
agreeable
manner
moyese
immediately
wrote
a
note
which
he
despatched
to
his
lawyers
ketchum
and
lee
desiring
them
to
make
out
a
set
of
free
papers
for
his
boy
george
and
to
have
them
ready
for
delivery
on
the
morrow
as
it
was
his
custom
to
give
his
presents
two
or
three
days
in
advance
of
the
coming
year
the
note
found
ketchum
deep
in
a
disputed
will
case
upon
the
decision
of
which
depended
the
freedom
of
some
slaves
who
had
been
emancipated
by
the
will
of
their
late
master
by
which
piece
of
posthumous
benevolence
his
heirs
had
been
greatly
irritated
and
were
in
consequence
endeavouring
to
prove
him
insane
look
at
that
lee
said
he
tossing
the
note
to
his
partner
if
that
old
moyese
is
the
most
curious
specimen
of
humanity
in
all
new
orleans
he
is
going
to
give
away
clear
fifteen
hundred
dollars
as
a
gift
to
whom
asked
lee
he
has
sent
me
orders
replied
ketchum
to
make
out
a
set
of
free
papers
for
his
boy
george
well
i
ca
say
that
i
see
so
much
in
that
said
lee
how
can
he
expect
to
keep
him
george
is
almost
as
white
as
you
or
i
and
has
the
manners
and
appearance
of
a
gentleman
he
might
walk
off
any
day
without
the
least
fear
of
detection
very
true
rejoined
ketchum
but
i
do
think
he
would
do
it
he
is
very
much
attached
to
the
old
gentleman
and
no
doubt
would
remain
with
him
as
long
as
the
old
man
lives
but
i
rather
think
the
heirs
would
have
to
whistle
for
him
after
moyese
was
put
under
ground
however
concluded
ketchum
they
wo
have
much
opportunity
to
dispute
the
matter
as
he
will
be
a
free
man
no
doubt
before
he
is
hours
older
a
day
or
two
after
this
moyese
entertained
all
his
nephews
and
nieces
at
dinner
and
each
was
gratified
with
some
appropriate
gift
the
old
man
sat
happily
regarding
the
group
that
crowded
round
him
their
faces
beaming
with
delight
the
claim
for
the
seat
of
honour
on
uncle
moyese
knee
was
clamorously
disputed
and
the
old
gentleman
was
endeavouring
to
settle
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
when
a
servant
entered
and
delivered
a
document
tied
with
red
tape
oh
the
papers
now
my
dears
let
uncle
go
gustave
let
go
your
hold
of
my
leg
or
i
ca
get
up
amy
ring
the
bell
dear
this
operation
moyese
was
obliged
to
lift
her
into
the
chair
to
effect
where
she
remained
tugging
at
the
until
she
was
lifted
out
again
by
the
servant
who
came
running
in
great
haste
to
answer
a
summons
of
such
unusual
vigour
tell
george
i
want
him
said
moyese
he
gone
down
to
the
office
i
hearn
him
say
suffin
bout
de
nordern
mail
as
he
went
out
but
i
duno
what
it
was
and
as
he
finished
he
vanished
from
the
apartment
and
might
soon
after
have
been
seen
with
his
mouth
in
close
contact
with
the
drumstick
of
a
turkey
moyese
being
now
released
from
the
children
took
his
way
to
the
office
with
the
portentous
document
that
was
to
so
greatly
change
the
condition
of
george
winston
in
his
coat
pocket
the
old
man
sat
down
at
his
desk
smiling
as
he
balanced
the
papers
in
his
hand
at
the
thought
of
the
happiness
he
was
about
to
confer
on
his
favourite
he
was
thus
engaged
when
the
door
opened
and
george
entered
bearing
some
orders
from
european
correspondents
in
reference
to
which
he
sought
instructions
i
think
sir
said
he
modestly
that
we
had
better
reply
at
once
to
ditson
and
send
him
the
advance
he
requires
as
he
will
not
otherwise
be
able
to
fill
these
and
as
he
concluded
he
laid
the
papers
on
the
table
and
stood
waiting
orders
respecting
them
moyese
laid
down
the
packet
and
after
looking
over
the
papers
george
had
brought
in
replied
i
think
we
had
write
to
him
to
draw
upon
us
for
the
amount
he
and
george
he
continued
looking
at
him
benevolently
what
would
you
like
for
a
present
anything
you
please
sir
was
the
respectful
reply
well
george
resumed
moyese
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
make
you
a
present
of
here
he
paused
and
looked
steadily
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
gravely
handing
him
the
papers
concluded
of
yourself
george
now
mind
and
do
throw
my
present
away
my
boy
george
stood
for
some
moments
looking
in
a
bewildered
manner
first
at
his
master
then
at
the
papers
at
last
the
reality
of
his
good
fortune
broke
fully
upon
him
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
unable
to
say
more
than
god
bless
you
mr
moyese
burst
into
tears
now
you
are
a
pretty
fellow
said
the
old
man
sobbing
himself
nothing
to
cry
about
get
home
as
fast
as
you
can
you
stupid
and
mind
you
are
here
early
in
the
morning
sir
for
i
intend
to
pay
you
five
hundred
dollars
and
i
mean
you
to
earn
it
and
thus
speaking
he
bustled
out
of
the
room
followed
by
george
repeated
god
bless
you
that
god
bless
you
played
about
his
ears
at
night
and
soothed
him
to
sleep
in
dreams
he
saw
it
written
in
diamond
letters
on
a
golden
crown
held
towards
him
by
a
hand
outstretched
from
the
azure
above
he
fancied
the
birds
sang
it
to
him
in
his
morning
walk
and
that
he
heard
it
in
the
ripple
of
the
little
stream
that
flowed
at
the
foot
of
his
garden
so
he
could
afford
to
smile
when
his
relatives
talked
about
his
mistaken
generosity
and
could
take
refuge
in
that
fervent
god
bless
you
six
years
after
this
event
moyese
died
leaving
george
a
sufficient
legacy
to
enable
him
to
commence
business
on
his
own
account
as
soon
as
he
had
arranged
his
affairs
he
started
for
his
old
home
to
endeavour
to
gain
by
personal
exertions
what
he
had
been
unable
to
learn
through
the
agency
of
others
a
knowledge
of
the
fate
of
his
mother
he
ascertained
that
she
had
been
sold
and
and
had
finally
died
in
new
orleans
not
more
than
three
miles
from
where
he
had
been
living
he
had
not
even
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
finding
her
grave
during
his
search
for
his
mother
he
had
become
acquainted
with
emily
the
wife
of
garie
and
discovered
that
she
was
his
cousin
and
to
this
was
owing
the
familiar
footing
on
which
we
find
him
in
the
household
where
we
first
introduced
him
to
our
readers
winston
had
just
returned
from
a
tour
through
the
northern
states
where
he
had
been
in
search
of
a
place
in
which
to
establish
himself
in
business
the
introductions
with
which
garie
had
kindly
favoured
him
had
enabled
him
to
see
enough
of
northern
society
to
convince
him
that
amongst
the
whites
he
could
not
form
either
social
or
business
connections
should
his
identity
with
the
african
race
be
discovered
and
whilst
on
the
other
hand
he
would
have
found
sufficiently
refined
associations
amongst
the
people
of
colour
to
satisfy
his
social
wants
he
felt
that
he
could
not
bear
the
isolation
and
contumely
to
which
they
were
subjected
he
therefore
decided
on
leaving
the
united
states
and
on
going
to
some
country
where
if
he
must
struggle
for
success
in
life
he
might
do
it
without
the
additional
embarrassments
that
would
be
thrown
in
his
way
in
his
native
land
solely
because
he
belonged
to
an
oppressed
race
chapter
ii
a
glance
at
the
ellis
family
i
wish
charlie
would
come
with
that
tea
exclaimed
ellis
who
sat
finishing
off
some
work
which
had
to
go
home
that
evening
i
wonder
what
can
keep
him
so
long
away
he
has
been
gone
over
an
hour
it
surely
can
not
take
him
that
time
to
go
to
watson
it
is
a
great
distance
mother
said
esther
ellis
who
was
busily
plying
her
needle
and
i
do
think
he
has
been
quite
so
long
as
you
suppose
yes
he
has
been
gone
a
good
hour
repeated
ellis
it
is
now
six
and
it
wanted
three
minutes
to
five
when
he
left
i
do
hope
he
wo
forget
that
i
told
him
half
black
and
half
green
he
is
so
forgetful
and
ellis
rubbed
her
spectacles
and
looked
peevishly
out
of
the
window
as
she
where
can
he
be
she
resumed
looking
in
the
direction
in
which
he
might
be
expected
oh
here
he
comes
and
caddy
with
him
they
have
just
turned
the
corner
open
the
door
and
let
them
in
esther
arose
and
on
opening
the
door
was
almost
knocked
down
by
abrupt
entrance
into
the
apartment
he
being
rather
forcibly
shoved
in
by
his
sister
caroline
who
appeared
to
be
in
a
high
state
of
indignation
where
do
you
think
he
was
mother
where
you
think
i
found
him
well
i
ca
say
i
really
do
know
in
some
mischief
i
be
bound
he
was
on
the
lot
playing
marbles
and
i
had
such
a
time
to
get
him
home
just
look
at
his
knees
they
are
worn
through
and
only
think
mother
the
tea
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
might
have
been
carried
off
if
i
had
not
happened
to
come
that
way
and
then
he
has
been
fighting
and
struggling
with
me
all
the
way
home
see
continued
she
baring
her
arm
just
look
how
he
has
scratched
me
and
as
she
spoke
she
held
out
the
injured
member
for
her
mother
inspection
mother
said
charlie
in
his
justification
she
began
to
beat
me
before
all
the
boys
before
i
had
said
a
word
to
her
and
i
was
going
to
stand
that
she
is
always
storming
at
me
she
do
give
me
any
peace
of
my
life
oh
yes
mother
here
interposed
esther
cad
is
too
cross
to
him
i
must
say
that
he
would
not
be
as
bad
as
he
is
if
she
would
only
let
him
alone
esther
please
hush
now
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
quarrels
settle
all
their
differences
you
always
take
his
part
whether
he
be
right
or
wrong
i
shall
send
him
to
bed
without
his
tea
and
i
will
take
his
marbles
from
him
and
if
i
see
his
knees
showing
through
his
pants
again
i
put
a
red
patch
on
them
that
what
i
do
now
sir
go
to
bed
and
do
let
me
hear
of
you
until
morning
and
ellis
were
at
the
head
of
a
highly
respectable
and
industrious
coloured
family
they
had
three
children
esther
the
eldest
was
a
girl
of
considerable
beauty
and
amiable
temper
caroline
the
second
child
was
plain
in
person
and
of
rather
shrewish
disposition
she
was
a
most
indefatigable
housewife
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
in
possession
of
a
dust
or
scrubbing
brush
she
would
have
regarded
a
place
where
she
could
have
lived
in
a
perpetual
state
of
house
cleaning
as
an
earthly
paradise
between
her
and
master
charlie
continued
warfare
existed
interrupted
only
by
brief
truces
brought
about
by
her
necessity
for
his
services
as
when
a
service
of
this
character
had
been
duly
rewarded
by
a
slice
of
bread
and
preserves
or
some
other
dainty
hostilities
would
most
probably
be
recommenced
by
charlie
making
an
inroad
upon
the
newly
cleaned
floor
and
leaving
the
prints
of
his
muddy
boots
thereon
the
fact
must
here
be
candidly
stated
that
charlie
was
not
a
tidy
boy
he
despised
mats
and
seldom
or
never
wiped
his
feet
on
entering
the
house
he
was
happiest
when
he
could
don
his
most
dilapidated
unmentionables
as
he
could
then
sit
down
where
he
pleased
without
the
fear
of
his
mother
before
his
eyes
and
enter
upon
a
game
of
marbles
with
his
mind
perfectly
free
from
all
harassing
cares
growing
out
of
any
possible
accident
to
the
aforesaid
garments
so
that
he
might
give
that
attention
to
the
game
that
its
importance
demanded
he
was
a
pretty
boy
clever
at
his
lessons
and
a
favourite
both
with
tutors
and
scholars
he
had
withal
a
thorough
boy
fondness
for
play
and
was
also
characterised
by
all
the
thoughtlessness
consequent
thereon
he
possessed
a
lively
affectionate
disposition
and
was
generally
at
peace
with
all
the
world
his
sister
caddy
excepted
caroline
had
recovered
her
breath
and
her
mind
being
soothed
by
the
judgment
that
had
been
pronounced
on
master
charlie
she
began
to
bustle
about
to
prepare
tea
the
shining
copper
was
brought
from
the
stove
where
it
had
been
seething
and
singing
for
the
last
then
the
of
china
received
its
customary
quantity
of
tea
which
was
set
upon
the
stove
to
brew
and
carefully
placed
behind
the
stove
pipe
that
no
accidental
touch
of
the
elbow
might
bring
it
to
destruction
plates
knives
and
teacups
came
rattling
forth
from
the
closet
the
butter
was
brought
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
placed
to
keep
it
cool
and
a
was
soon
smoking
on
the
table
and
sending
up
its
seducing
odour
into
the
room
to
which
charlie
had
been
recently
banished
causing
to
that
unfortunate
young
gentleman
great
physical
discomfort
now
mother
said
the
bustling
caddy
it
all
ready
come
now
and
sit
down
whilst
the
cake
is
hot
do
put
up
the
sewing
esther
and
come
neither
esther
nor
her
mother
needed
much
pressing
and
they
were
accordingly
soon
seated
round
the
table
on
which
their
repast
was
spread
put
away
a
slice
of
this
cake
for
father
said
ellis
for
he
be
home
until
late
he
is
obliged
to
attend
a
vestry
meeting
ellis
sat
for
some
time
sipping
the
fragrant
and
refreshing
tea
when
the
contents
of
two
or
three
cups
one
after
another
had
disappeared
and
sundry
slices
of
had
been
deposited
where
much
had
been
deposited
before
she
began
to
think
about
charlie
and
to
imagine
that
perhaps
she
had
been
rather
hasty
in
sending
him
to
bed
without
his
supper
what
had
charlie
in
his
to
take
to
school
with
him
she
inquired
of
caddy
why
mother
i
put
in
enough
for
a
wolf
three
or
four
slices
of
bread
with
as
many
more
of
some
cheese
one
of
those
little
pies
and
all
that
which
was
left
at
dinner
yesterday
he
must
have
had
enough
but
mother
you
know
he
always
gives
away
the
best
part
of
his
dinner
interposed
esther
he
supplies
two
or
three
boys
with
food
there
is
that
dirty
kinch
that
he
is
so
fond
of
who
never
takes
any
dinner
with
him
and
depends
entirely
upon
charlie
he
must
be
hungry
do
let
him
come
down
and
get
his
tea
mother
notwithstanding
the
observations
of
caroline
that
esther
was
just
persuading
her
mother
to
spoil
the
boy
that
he
would
be
worse
than
ever
and
many
other
similar
predictions
esther
and
the
tea
combined
won
a
signal
triumph
and
charlie
was
called
down
from
the
room
above
where
he
had
been
exchanging
telegraphic
communications
with
the
kinch
in
hopes
of
receiving
a
commutation
of
sentence
charlie
was
soon
seated
at
the
table
with
an
ample
allowance
of
and
tea
and
he
looked
so
demure
and
conducted
himself
in
such
an
exemplary
manner
that
one
would
have
scarcely
thought
him
given
to
marbles
and
dirty
company
having
eaten
to
his
satisfaction
he
quite
ingratiated
himself
with
caddy
by
picking
up
all
the
crumbs
he
had
spilled
during
tea
and
throwing
them
upon
the
this
last
act
was
quite
a
stroke
of
policy
as
even
caddy
began
to
regard
him
as
capable
of
reformation
the
washed
up
and
cleared
away
the
females
busied
themselves
with
their
sewing
and
charlie
immersed
himself
in
his
lessons
for
the
morrow
with
a
hearty
goodwill
and
perseverance
as
if
he
had
abjured
marbles
for
ever
the
hearty
supper
and
persevering
attention
to
study
soon
began
to
produce
their
customary
effect
upon
charlie
he
could
not
get
on
with
his
lessons
many
of
the
state
capitals
positively
refused
to
be
found
and
he
was
beginning
to
entertain
the
sage
notion
that
probably
some
of
the
legislatures
had
come
to
the
conclusion
to
dispense
with
them
altogether
or
had
had
them
placed
in
such
obscure
places
that
they
could
not
be
found
the
variously
coloured
states
began
to
form
a
vast
kaleidoscope
in
which
the
lakes
and
rivers
had
been
entirely
swallowed
up
ranges
of
mountains
disappeared
and
gulfs
and
bays
and
islands
were
entirely
lost
in
fact
he
was
sleepy
and
had
already
had
two
or
three
narrow
escapes
from
butting
over
the
candles
finally
he
fell
from
his
chair
crushing
bonnet
to
the
intense
grief
and
indignation
of
that
young
lady
who
inflicted
summary
vengeance
upon
him
before
he
was
sufficiently
awake
to
be
aware
of
what
had
happened
the
work
being
finished
ellis
and
caddy
prepared
to
take
it
home
to
thomas
leaving
esther
at
home
to
receive
her
father
on
his
return
and
give
him
his
tea
ellis
and
caddy
wended
their
way
towards
the
fashionable
part
of
the
city
looking
in
at
the
various
as
they
went
numberless
were
the
great
bargains
they
saw
there
displayed
and
divers
were
the
discussions
they
held
respecting
them
oh
is
that
a
pretty
calico
mother
that
with
the
green
ground
is
pretty
but
it
wo
wash
child
those
colours
always
run
just
look
at
that
silk
though
now
that
cheap
you
must
acknowledge
only
and
a
half
cents
if
i
only
had
a
dress
of
that
i
should
be
fixed
laws
caddy
replied
ellis
that
stuff
is
as
slazy
as
a
washed
cotton
handkerchief
and
coarse
enough
almost
to
sift
sand
through
it
would
last
you
any
time
the
silks
they
make
ai
worth
anything
they
do
wear
well
at
all
why
continued
she
when
i
was
a
girl
they
made
silks
that
would
stand
on
end
and
one
of
them
would
last
a
they
had
now
reached
which
was
filled
with
people
enjoying
the
balmy
breath
of
a
soft
may
evening
ellis
and
caddy
walked
briskly
onward
and
were
soon
beyond
the
line
of
shops
and
entered
upon
the
aristocratic
quarter
into
which
many
of
its
residents
had
retired
that
they
might
be
out
of
sight
of
the
houses
in
which
their
fathers
or
grandfathers
had
made
their
fortunes
mother
said
caddy
this
is
grant
new
house
is
it
a
splendid
place
they
say
it
like
a
palace
inside
they
are
great
people
them
grants
i
saw
in
the
newspaper
yesterday
that
young
augustus
grant
had
been
appointed
an
attache
to
the
american
legation
at
paris
the
newspapers
say
he
is
a
rising
man
well
he
ought
to
be
rejoined
ellis
for
his
old
made
yeast
enough
to
raise
the
whole
family
many
a
pennyworth
has
he
sold
me
laws
how
the
poor
old
folk
do
get
up
i
think
i
can
see
the
old
man
now
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
dealing
out
his
yeast
he
wore
one
coat
for
about
twenty
years
and
used
to
be
always
bragging
about
it
as
they
were
thus
talking
a
door
of
one
of
the
splendid
mansions
they
were
passing
opened
and
a
young
man
came
slowly
down
the
steps
and
walked
on
before
them
with
a
very
measured
step
and
peculiar
gait
that
young
whiston
mother
whispered
caddy
he
courting
young
miss
morton
you
do
say
so
replied
the
astonished
ellis
why
i
declare
his
grandfather
laid
her
grandfather
out
old
whiston
was
an
undertaker
and
used
to
make
the
handsomest
coffins
of
his
time
and
he
is
going
to
marry
miss
morton
what
next
i
like
to
know
he
walks
exactly
like
the
old
man
i
used
to
mock
him
when
i
was
a
little
girl
he
had
just
that
kind
of
gait
and
he
was
the
funniest
man
that
ever
lived
seen
him
at
a
funeral
go
into
the
parlour
and
condole
with
the
family
and
talk
about
the
dear
departed
until
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
then
he
be
down
in
the
kitchen
eating
and
drinking
and
laughing
and
telling
jokes
about
the
corpses
before
the
tears
were
dry
on
his
face
how
he
used
to
make
money
he
buried
almost
all
the
respectable
people
about
town
and
made
a
large
fortune
he
owned
a
in
and
when
the
property
in
that
vicinity
became
valuable
he
turned
the
dead
folks
out
and
built
houses
on
the
ground
i
should
say
it
was
a
very
pleasant
place
to
live
in
if
there
are
such
things
as
ghosts
said
caddy
laughing
i
for
one
would
like
to
live
there
but
here
we
are
at
thomas
how
short
the
way
has
seemed
caroline
gave
a
fierce
rap
at
the
door
which
was
opened
by
old
aunt
rachel
the
fat
cook
who
had
lived
with
the
thomases
for
a
fabulous
length
of
time
she
was
an
old
woman
when
ellis
came
as
a
girl
into
the
family
and
had
given
her
many
a
cuff
in
days
long
past
in
fact
notwithstanding
ellis
had
been
married
many
years
and
had
children
almost
as
old
as
she
herself
was
when
she
left
thomas
aunt
rachel
could
never
be
induced
to
regard
her
otherwise
than
as
a
girl
oh

she
gruffly
as
she
opened
the
door

all

added
she
puffing
and
blowing
as
she
waddled
back
into
her
sanctum
waiting
until
the
irate
old
cook
had
recovered
her
breath
ellis
modestly
inquired
if
thomas
was
at
home
go
up
and
see
was
the
surly
response
you

up
stars

stockings
i

poor
caddy
was
boiling
over
with
wrath
but
deeming
prudence
the
better
part
of
valour
she
did
not
venture
upon
any
wordy
contest
with
aunt
rachel
but
sat
down
upon
the
stool
by
the
in
which
a
bright
fire
was
blazing
up
the
chimney
an
old
was
clicking
whirling
and
making
the
most
dismal
noise
imaginable
this
old
was
aunt
rachel
especial
and
she
obstinately
and
successfully
defended
it
against
all
comers
she
turned
up
her
nose
at
all
modern
inventions
designed
for
the
same
use
as
entirely
beneath
her
notice
she
had
been
accustomed
to
hearing
its
rattle
for
the
last
forty
years
and
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
committing
suicide
as
consenting
to
its
removal
she
and
her
cat
were
admirably
matched
he
was
as
snappish
and
cross
as
she
and
resented
with
distended
claws
and
elevated
back
all
attempts
on
the
part
of
strangers
to
cultivate
amicable
relations
with
him
in
fact
tom
pugnacious
disposition
was
clearly
evidenced
by
his
appearance
one
side
of
his
face
having
a
very
battered
aspect
and
the
fur
being
torn
off
his
back
in
several
places
caddy
sat
for
some
time
surveying
the
old
woman
and
her
cat
in
evident
awe
of
both
she
regarded
also
with
great
admiration
the
scrupulously
clean
and
shining
kitchen
tins
that
garnished
the
walls
and
reflected
the
red
light
of
the
blazing
fire
the
wooden
dresser
was
a
miracle
of
whiteness
and
ranged
thereon
was
a
set
of
blue
china
on
which
was
displayed
the
usual
number
of
those
unearthly
figures
which
none
but
the
chinese
can
create
tick
tick
went
the
old
dutch
clock
in
the
corner
and
the
kept
up
its
whirring
noise
old
tom
and
aunt
rachel
were
both
napping
and
so
caddy
having
no
other
resource
went
to
sleep
also
ellis
found
her
way
without
any
difficulty
to
thomas
room
her
gentle
tap
upon
the
door
quite
flurried
that
good
lady
who
we
speak
it
softly
was
dressing
her
wig
a
task
she
entrusted
to
no
other
mortal
hands
she
peeped
out
and
seeing
who
it
was
immediately
opened
the
door
without
hesitation
oh
it
you
is
it
come
in
ellen
said
she
i
do
mind
you
i
brought
the
home
said
ellis
laying
her
bundle
upon
the
table
i
hope
they
suit
oh
no
doubt
they
will
did
you
bring
the
bill
asked
thomas
the
bill
was
produced
and
ellis
sat
down
whilst
thomas
counted
out
the
money
this
having
been
duly
effected
and
the
bill
carefully
placed
on
the
file
thomas
also
sat
down
and
commenced
her
usual
lamentation
over
the
state
of
her
nerves
and
the
extravagance
of
the
younger
members
of
the
family
on
the
latter
subject
she
spoke
very
feelingly
such
goings
on
ellen
are
enough
to
set
me
crazy
so
many
nurses
and
then
we
have
to
keep
four
horses
and
it
company
company
from
monday
morning
until
saturday
night
the
house
is
kept
continually
money
money
for
everything
all
going
out
and
nothing
coming
in
and
the
unfortunate
thomas
whined
and
groaned
as
if
she
had
not
at
that
moment
an
income
of
clear
fifteen
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
a
sister
who
might
die
any
day
and
leave
her
half
as
much
more
thomas
was
the
daughter
of
the
respectable
old
gentleman
whom
whiston
grandfather
had
prepared
for
his
final
her
daughter
had
married
into
a
once
wealthy
but
now
decayed
carolina
family
in
consideration
of
the
wealth
bequeathed
by
her
grandfather
who
was
a
maker
of
leather
breeches
and
speculator
in
general
miss
thomas
had
received
the
offer
of
the
hand
of
morton
and
had
accepted
it
with
evident
pleasure
as
he
was
undoubtedly
a
member
of
one
of
the
first
families
of
the
south
and
could
prove
a
distant
connection
with
one
of
the
noble
families
of
england
they
had
several
children
and
their
incessant
wants
had
rendered
it
necessary
that
another
servant
should
be
kept
now
thomas
had
long
had
her
eye
on
charlie
with
a
view
of
incorporating
him
with
the
thomas
establishment
and
thought
this
would
be
a
favourable
time
to
broach
the
subject
to
his
mother
she
therefore
commenced
by
inquiring
how
have
you
got
through
the
winter
ellen
everything
has
been
so
dear
that
even
we
have
felt
the
effect
of
the
high
prices
oh
tolerably
well
i
thank
you
husband
business
it
is
true
has
not
been
as
brisk
as
usual
but
we
ought
not
to
complain
now
that
we
have
got
the
house
paid
for
and
the
girls
do
so
much
sewing
we
get
on
very
nicely
i
should
think
three
children
must
be
something
of
a
burthen
must
be
hard
to
provide
for
oh
no
not
at
all
rejoined
ellis
who
seemed
rather
surprised
at
thomas
uncommon
solicitude
respecting
them
we
have
never
found
the
children
a
burthen
thank
god
they
rather
a
comfort
and
a
pleasure
than
otherwise
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
ellen
very
glad
indeed
for
i
have
been
quite
disturbed
in
mind
respecting
you
during
the
winter
i
really
several
times
thought
of
sending
to
take
charlie
off
your
hands
what
is
he
doing
now
he
goes
to
school
regularly
he
has
missed
a
day
all
winter
you
should
just
see
his
writing
continued
ellis
warming
up
with
a
pride
in
her
only
son
he
wo
let
the
girls
make
out
any
of
the
bills
but
does
it
all
himself
he
made
out
yours
thomas
took
down
the
file
and
looked
at
the
bill
again
it
very
neatly
written
very
neatly
written
indeed
is
it
about
time
that
he
left
school
do
you
think
he
has
education
enough
she
inquired
his
father
do
he
intends
sending
him
to
another
school
after
vacation
where
they
teach
latin
and
greek
and
a
number
of
other
branches
nonsense
nonsense
ellen
if
i
were
you
i
would
hear
of
it
there
wo
be
a
particle
of
good
result
to
the
child
from
any
such
acquirements
it
is
as
though
he
was
a
white
child
what
use
can
latin
or
greek
be
to
a
coloured
boy
none
in
the
world
he
have
to
be
a
common
mechanic
or
perhaps
a
servant
or
barber
or
something
of
that
kind
and
then
what
use
would
all
his
fine
education
be
to
him
take
my
advice
ellen
and
have
him
taught
things
that
will
make
him
feel
above
the
situation
he
in
all
probability
will
have
to
fill
now
continued
she
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
let
him
come
and
live
with
me
awhile
i
pay
you
well
and
take
good
care
of
him
besides
he
will
be
learning
something
here
good
manners
not
that
he
is
not
a
child
but
you
know
ellen
there
is
something
every
one
learns
by
coming
in
daily
contact
with
refined
and
educated
people
that
can
not
but
be
beneficial
come
now
make
up
your
mind
to
leave
him
with
me
at
least
until
the
winter
when
the
schools
again
commence
and
then
if
his
father
is
still
resolved
to
send
him
back
to
school
why
he
can
do
so
let
me
have
him
for
the
summer
at
least
ellis
who
had
always
been
accustomed
to
regard
thomas
as
a
miracle
of
wisdom
was
of
course
greatly
impressed
with
what
she
had
said
she
had
lived
many
years
in
her
family
and
had
left
it
to
marry
ellis
a
thrifty
mechanic
who
came
from
savanah
her
native
city
she
had
great
reverence
for
any
opinion
thomas
expressed
and
after
some
further
conversation
on
the
subject
made
up
her
mind
to
consent
to
the
proposal
and
left
her
with
the
intention
of
converting
her
husband
to
her
way
of
thinking
on
descending
to
the
kitchen
she
awoke
caddy
from
a
delicious
dream
in
which
she
had
been
presented
with
the
black
silk
that
they
had
seen
in
the
shop
window
marked
and
a
half
cents
a
yard
in
the
dream
she
had
determined
to
make
it
up
with
tight
sleeves
and
infant
waist
that
being
the
most
approved
style
at
that
period
five
breadths
are
not
enough
for
the
skirt
and
if
i
take
six
i
must
skimp
the
waist
and
cape
murmured
she
in
her
sleep
wake
up
girl
what
are
you
thinking
about
said
her
mother
giving
her
another
shake
oh
said
caddy
with
a
wild
and
disappointed
look
i
was
dreaming
was
i
i
declare
i
thought
i
had
that
silk
frock
in
the
window
the
girls
heads
are
always
running
on
finery
wake
up
and
come
along
i
going
home
caddy
followed
her
mother
out
leaving
aunt
rachel
and
tom
nodding
at
each
other
as
they
dozed
before
the
fire
that
night
ellis
and
his
wife
had
a
long
conversation
upon
the
proposal
of
thomas
and
after
divers
objections
raised
by
him
and
set
aside
by
her
it
was
decided
that
charlie
should
be
permitted
to
go
there
for
the
holidays
at
least
after
which
his
father
resolved
he
should
be
sent
to
school
again
charlie
the
next
morning
looked
very
blank
on
being
informed
of
his
approaching
fate
caddy
undertook
with
great
alacrity
to
break
the
dismal
tidings
to
him
and
enlarged
in
a
glowing
manner
upon
what
times
he
might
expect
from
aunt
rachel
i
guess
she
keep
you
straight
you
see
sights
up
there
she
is
cross
as
sin
she
make
you
wipe
your
feet
when
you
go
in
and
out
if
no
one
else
can
let
him
alone
caddy
gently
interposed
esther
it
is
bad
enough
to
be
compelled
to
live
in
a
house
with
that
frightful
old
woman
without
being
annoyed
about
it
beforehand
if
i
could
help
it
charlie
you
should
not
go
i
know
you
keep
me
home
if
you
could
but
old
cad
here
she
always
rejoices
if
anything
happens
to
me
i
be
hanged
if
i
stay
there
said
he
i
wo
live
at
service
i
rather
be
a
sweep
or
sell
apples
on
the
dock
i
not
going
to
be
stuck
up
behind
their
carriage
dressed
up
like
a
monkey
in
a
tail
coat
i
cut
off
my
own
head
first
and
with
this
sanguinary
threat
he
left
the
house
with
his
under
his
arm
intending
to
lay
the
case
before
his
friend
and
adviser
the
redoubtable
and
sympathising
kinch
chapter
iii
charlie
trials
charlie
started
for
school
with
a
heavy
heart
had
it
not
been
for
his
impending
doom
of
service
in
thomas
family
he
would
have
been
the
happiest
boy
that
ever
carried
a
it
did
not
require
a
great
deal
to
render
this
young
gentleman
happy
all
that
was
necessary
to
make
up
a
day
of
perfect
joyfulness
with
him
was
a
dozen
marbles
permission
to
wear
his
worst
inexpressibles
and
to
be
thoroughly
up
in
his
lessons
he
was
possessed
of
all
these
requisites
but
there
was
also
in
the
perspective
along
array
of
skirmishes
with
aunt
rachel
who
he
knew
looked
on
him
with
an
evil
eye
and
who
had
frequently
expressed
herself
regarding
him
in
his
presence
in
terms
by
no
means
complimentary
or
affectionate
and
the
manner
in
which
she
had
intimated
her
desire
on
one
or
two
occasions
to
have
an
opportunity
of
reforming
his
personal
habits
were
by
no
means
calculated
to
produce
a
happy
frame
of
mind
now
that
the
opportunity
was
about
to
be
afforded
her
charlie
sauntered
on
until
he
came
to
a
where
he
stopped
and
examined
a
corner
of
the
fence
very
attentively
not
gone
by
yet
i
must
wait
for
him
said
he
and
forthwith
he
commenced
climbing
the
highest
pile
of
boards
the
top
of
which
he
reached
at
the
imminent
risk
of
his
neck
here
he
sat
awaiting
the
advent
of
his
friend
kinch
the
absence
of
death
head
and
cross
bones
from
the
corner
of
the
fence
being
a
clear
indication
that
he
had
not
yet
passed
on
his
way
to
school
soon
however
he
was
espied
in
the
distance
and
as
he
was
quite
a
character
in
his
way
we
must
describe
him
his
most
prominent
feature
was
a
capacious
mouth
within
which
glistened
a
row
of
perfect
teeth
he
had
the
merriest
twinkling
black
eyes
and
a
nose
so
small
and
flat
that
it
would
have
been
a
prize
to
any
editor
living
as
it
would
have
been
a
physical
impossibility
to
have
pulled
it
no
matter
what
outrage
he
had
committed
his
complexion
was
of
a
ruddy
brown
and
his
hair
entirely
innocent
of
a
comb
was
decorated
with
divers
feathery
tokens
of
his
last
night
rest
a
cap
with
the
front
torn
off
jauntily
set
on
one
side
of
his
head
gave
him
a
rakish
and
air
his
clothes
were
patched
and
torn
in
several
places
and
his
shoes
were
already
in
an
advanced
stage
of
decay
as
he
approached
the
fence
he
took
a
piece
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
and
commenced
to
sketch
the
accustomed
startling
illustration
which
was
to
convey
to
charlie
the
intelligence
that
he
had
already
passed
there
on
his
way
to
school
when
a
quantity
of
sawdust
came
down
in
a
shower
on
his
head
as
soon
as
the
blinding
storm
had
ceased
kinch
looked
up
and
intimated
to
charlie
that
it
was
quite
late
and
that
there
was
a
probability
of
their
being
after
time
at
school
this
information
caused
charlie
to
make
rather
a
hasty
descent
in
doing
which
his
was
upset
and
its
contents
displayed
at
the
feet
of
the
voracious
kinch
now
i
be
even
with
you
for
that
sawdust
cried
he
as
he
pocketed
two
boiled
eggs
and
bit
an
immense
piece
out
of
an
which
he
would
have
demolished
completely
but
for
the
prompt
interposition
of
its
owner
oh
my
golly
charlie
your
mother
makes
good
pies
he
exclaimed
with
rapture
as
soon
as
he
could
get
his
mouth
sufficiently
clear
to
speak
give
us
another
bite
only
a
nibble
but
charlie
knew
by
experience
what
kinch
nibbles
were
and
he
very
wisely
declined
saying
sadly
as
he
did
so
you
wo
get
many
more
dinners
from
me
kinch
i
going
to
leave
school
no
you
though
are
you
asked
the
astonished
kinch
you
are
not
going
are
you
really
yes
really
replied
charlie
with
a
doleful
look
mother
is
going
to
put
me
out
at
service
and
do
you
intend
to
go
asked
kinch
looking
at
him
incredulously
why
of
course
was
the
reply
how
can
i
help
going
if
father
and
mother
say
i
must
i
tell
you
what
i
should
do
said
kinch
if
it
was
me
i
should
act
so
bad
that
the
people
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
they
hired
me
out
to
live
once
and
i
led
the
people
they
put
me
with
such
a
dance
that
they
was
glad
enough
to
send
me
home
again
this
observation
brought
them
to
the
which
was
but
a
trifling
distance
from
the
residence
of
ellis
they
entered
the
school
at
the
last
moment
of
grace
and
dicker
looked
at
them
severely
as
they
took
their
seats
just
saved
ourselves
whispered
kinch
a
minute
later
and
we
would
have
been
done
for
and
with
this
closing
remark
he
applied
himself
to
his
grammar
a
very
judicious
move
on
his
part
for
he
had
not
looked
at
his
lesson
and
there
were
but
ten
minutes
to
elapse
before
the
class
would
be
called
the
lessons
were
droned
through
as
lessons
usually
are
at
school
there
was
the
average
amount
of
flogging
performed
cakes
nuts
and
candy
confiscated
little
boys
on
the
back
seats
punched
one
another
as
little
boys
on
the
back
seats
always
will
do
and
were
flogged
in
consequence
then
the
boy
who
never
knew
his
lessons
was
graced
with
the
fool
cap
and
was
pointed
and
stared
at
until
the
arrival
of
the
relieved
him
from
his
disagreeable
situation
what
kind
of
folks
are
these
thomases
asked
kinch
as
he
sat
beside
charlie
in
the
playground
munching
the
last
of
the
what
kind
of
folks
are
they
tell
me
that
and
i
can
give
you
some
good
advice
old
thomas
is
a
little
old
woman
who
wears
spectacles
and
a
wig
she
is
of
much
account
i
do
mind
her
she
not
the
trouble
it
of
old
aunt
rachel
i
thinking
why
she
has
threatened
to
whip
me
when
i
been
there
with
mother
and
she
even
talks
to
her
sometimes
as
if
she
was
a
little
girl
lord
only
knows
what
she
do
to
me
when
she
has
me
there
by
myself
you
should
just
see
her
and
her
cat
i
really
do
know
continued
charlie
which
is
the
worst
looking
i
hate
them
both
like
poison
and
as
he
concluded
he
bit
into
a
piece
of
bread
as
fiercely
as
if
he
were
already
engaged
in
a
desperate
battle
with
aunt
rachel
and
was
biting
her
in
well
said
kinch
with
the
air
of
a
person
of
vast
experience
in
difficult
cases
i
should
drown
the
cat
i
do
that
at
once
as
soon
as

there
then
let
me
ask

aunt
rachel
got
corns
corns

wish

charlie
why

the
river
in
they
are
so
large
yes
she
has
got
corns
bunions
and
rheumatism
and
everything
else
ah
then
said
kinch
your
way
is
clear
enough
if
she
has
got
corns
i
should
confine
myself
to
operating
on
them
i
should
give
my
whole
attention
to
her
feet
when
she
attempts
to
take
hold
of
you
do
you
jist
come
down
on
her
corns
fling
your
shins
about
kinder
wild
you
know
and
let
her
have
it
on
both
feet
you
see
i
tried
that
plan
and
know
by
experience
that
it
works
well
do
you
see
you
can
pass
that
off
as
an
accident
and
it
do
look
well
to
be
scratching
and
biting
as
for
the
lady
of
the
house
old
do
you
just
manage
to
knock
her
wig
off
before
some
company
and
they
send
you
home
at
once
hardly
give
you
time
to
get
your
hat
charlie
laid
these
directions
aside
in
his
mind
for
future
application
and
asked
what
did
you
do
kinch
to
get
away
from
the
people
you
were
with
do
ask
me
said
kinch
laughing
do
boy
do
ask
me
my
conscience
troubles
me
awful
about
it
sometimes
i
fell
up
stairs
with
dishes
and
i
fell
down
stairs
with
dishes
i
spilled
oil
on
the
carpet
and
broke
a
but
it
was
all
accidental
entirely
accidental
they
found
i
was
too
and
so
they
sent
me
home
oh
i
would
do
anything
like
that
i
would
destroy
anything
but
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
wo
stay
there
at
any
rate
i
do
mind
work
i
want
to
do
something
to
assist
father
and
mother
but
i
do
want
to
be
any
one
servant
i
wish
i
was
big
enough
to
work
at
the
shop
how
did
your
mother
come
to
think
of
putting
you
there
asked
kinch
the
lord
alone
knows
was
the
reply
i
suppose
old
thomas
told
her
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
for
me
and
mother
thinks
what
she
says
is
law
and
gospel
i
believe
old
thomas
thinks
a
coloured
person
ca
get
to
heaven
without
first
living
at
service
a
little
while
the
school
bell
ringing
put
an
end
to
this
important
conversation
and
the
boys
recommenced
their
lessons
when
charlie
returned
from
school
the
first
person
he
saw
on
entering
the
house
was
robberts
thomas
chief
functionary
and
the
presiding
genius
of
the
wine
cellar
when
he
was
trusted
with
the
key
charlie
learned
to
his
horror
and
dismay
that
he
had
been
sent
by
thomas
to
inquire
into
the
possibility
of
obtaining
his
services
immediately
as
they
were
going
to
have
a
series
of
dinner
parties
and
it
was
thought
that
he
could
be
rendered
quite
useful
and
must
i
go
mother
he
asked
yes
my
son
i
told
robberts
that
you
shall
come
up
in
the
morning
replied
ellis
then
turning
to
robberts
she
inquired
how
is
aunt
rachel
at
this
question
the
liveried
gentleman
from
thomas
shook
his
head
dismally
and
answered
do
ask
me
woman
do
ask
me
if
you
please
that
old
sinner
gets
worse
and
worse
every
day
she
lives
these
dinners
we
to
have
has
just
set
her
wild
she
is
mad
as
fury
and
she
snaps
me
up
just
as
if
i
was
to
blame
that
is
an
awful
old
woman
now
mind
i
tell
you
as
robberts
concluded
he
took
his
hat
and
departed
giving
charlie
the
cheering
intelligence
that
he
should
expect
him
early
next
morning
charlie
quite
lost
his
appetite
for
supper
in
consequence
of
his
approaching
trials
and
laying
aside
his
books
with
a
sigh
of
regret
sat
listlessly
regarding
his
sisters
enlivened
now
and
then
by
some
cheerful
remark
from
caddy
such
as
you
have
to
keep
your
feet
cleaner
up
there
than
you
do
at
home
or
you
have
aunt
rach
in
your
wool
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
you
must
throw
your
cap
and
coat
down
where
you
please
on
the
chairs
or
tables
she
bring
you
out
of
all
that
in
a
short
time
i
expect
have
two
or
three
bastings
before
you
have
been
there
a
week
for
she
put
up
with
any
nonsense
ah
boy
she
concluded
chuckling
you
have
a
time
of
it
i
do
envy
you
with
these
and
similar
enlivening
anticipations
caddy
whiled
away
the
time
until
it
was
the
hour
for
charlie
to
retire
for
the
night
which
he
did
with
a
heavy
heart
early
the
following
morning
he
was
awakened
by
the
indefatigable
caddy
and
he
found
a
small
bundle
of
necessaries
prepared
until
his
trunk
of
apparel
could
be
sent
to
his
new
home
oh
cad
he
exclaimed
rubbing
his
eyes
how
i
do
hate
to
go
up
there
i
rather
take
a
good
whipping
than
go
well
it
is
too
late
now
to
talk
about
it
hurry
and
get
your
clothes
on
it
is
quite
late
you
ought
to
have
been
off
an
hour
ago
when
he
came
down
stairs
prepared
to
go
his
mother
hoped
that
he
was
going
to
behave
like
a
man
which
exhortation
had
the
effect
of
setting
him
crying
at
once
and
then
he
had
to
be
caressed
by
the
tearful
esther
and
finally
started
away
with
very
red
eyes
followed
to
the
door
by
his
mother
and
the
girls
who
stood
looking
after
him
for
some
moments
so
hurried
and
unexpected
had
been
his
departure
that
he
had
been
unable
to
communicate
with
his
friend
kinch
this
weighed
very
heavily
on
his
spirits
and
he
occupied
the
time
on
his
way
to
thomas
in
devising
various
plans
to
effect
that
object
on
arriving
he
gave
a
faint
rap
that
was
responded
to
by
aunt
rachel
who
saluted
him
with
oh
yer
come
has
yer
wipe
your
feet
child
and
come
in
quick
shut
the
door
after
yer
what

holding

his
package

kitchen
charlie
mechanically
obeyed
and
then
followed
her
into
her
sanctuary

asked
in
a
surly
tone

or

i
ca
keep
the
breakfast
things
standing
here
all
day
charlie
to
whom
the
long
walk
had
given
a
good
appetite
immediately
sat
down
and
ate
a
prodigious
quantity
of
bread
and
butter
together
with
several
slices
of
cold
ham
washed
down
by
two
cups
of
tea
after
which
he
rested
his
knife
and
fork
and
informed
aunt
rachel
that
he
had
done
well
i
think
it
high
time
responded
she
why
boy
you
breed
a
famine
in
de
house
if

stay
here
long
enough
you

to
do
a

old
thomas

down

charlie
was
thus
engaged
when
thomas
entered
the
kitchen
well
charles
good
morning
said
she
in
a
bland
voice
i
glad
to
see
you
here
so
soon
has
he
had
his
breakfast
aunt
rachel
yes
and
he
eat
like
a
wild
animal
i
never
see
a
child
eat
more
in
my
life
was
aunt
rachel
abrupt
answer
i
glad
he
has
a
good
appetite
said
thomas
it
shows
he
has
good
health
boys
will
eat
you
ca
expect
them
to
work
if
they
do
but
it
is
time
i
was
at
those
custards
charlie
put
down
those
peas
and
go
into
the
other
room
and
bring
me
a
basket
of
eggs
you
will
find
on
the
table
and
be
sure
to
overset
the
milk
that
side
of
it
yer
hear
added
aunt
rachel
charlie
thought
to
himself
that
he
would
like
to
accommodate
her
but
he
denied
himself
that
pleasure
on
the
ground
that
it
might
not
be
safe
to
do
it
thomas
was
a
housekeeper
of
the
old
school
and
had
a
scientific
knowledge
of
the
manner
in
which
all
sorts
of
pies
and
puddings
were
compounded
she
was
so
learned
in
custards
and
preserves
that
even
aunt
rachel
sometimes
deferred
to
her
superior
judgment
in
these
matters
carefully
breaking
the
eggs
she
skilfully
separated
the
whites
from
the
yolks
and
gave
the
latter
to
charlie
to
beat
at
first
he
thought
it
great
fun
and
he
hummed
some
of
the
popular
melodies
of
the
day
and
kept
time
with
his
foot
and
the
spatula
but
pretty
soon
he
exhausted
his
stock
of
tunes
and
then
the
performances
did
not
go
off
so
well
his
arm
commenced
aching
and
he
came
to
the
sage
conclusion
before
he
was
relieved
from
his
task
that
those
who
eat
the
custards
are
much
better
off
than
those
who
prepare
them
this
task
finished
he
was
pressed
into
service
by
aunt
rachel
to
pick
and
stone
some
raisins
which
she
gave
him
with
the
injunction
either
to
sing
or
whistle
all
the
time
he
was
at
and
that
if
he
stopped
for
a
moment
she
should
know
he
was
eating
them
and
in
that
case
she
would
visit
him
with
condign
punishment
on
the
spot
for
she
did
care
a
fig
whose
child
he
was
thus
in
the
performance
of
first
one
little
job
and
then
another
the
day
wore
away
and
as
the
hour
approached
at
which
the
guests
were
invited
charlie
after
being
taken
into
the
by
robberts
where
he
was
greatly
amazed
at
the
display
of
silver
cut
glass
and
elegant
china
was
posted
at
the
door
to
relieve
the
guests
of
their
coats
and
hats
which
duty
he
performed
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
all
parties
concerned
at
dinner
however
he
was
not
so
fortunate
he
upset
a
plate
of
soup
into
a
gentleman
lap
and
damaged
beyond
repair
one
of
the
elegant
china
vegetable
dishes
he
took
rather
too
deep
an
interest
in
the
conversation
for
a
person
in
his
station
and
in
fact
the
bright
boy
alluded
to
by
winston
as
having
corrected
the
reverend
gentleman
respecting
the
quotation
from
chaucer
was
no
other
than
our
friend
charlie
ellis
in
the
evening
when
the
guests
were
departing
charlie
handed
winston
his
coat
admiring
the
texture
and
cut
of
it
very
much
as
he
did
so
winston
amused
at
the
boy
manner
asked
what
is
your
name
my
little
man
charles
ellis
was
the
prompt
reply
i
named
after
my
father
and
where
did
your
father
come
from
charlie
he
asked
looking
very
much
interested
from
savanah
sir
now
tell
me
where
came
from
replied
charles
i
came
from
new
orleans
said
winston
with
a
smile
now
tell
me
he
continued
where
do
you
live
when
you
are
with
your
parents
i
should
like
to
see
your
father
charlie
quickly
put
his
interrogator
in
possession
of
the
desired
information
after
which
winston
departed
soon
followed
by
the
other
guests
charlie
lay
for
some
time
that
night
on
his
little
cot
before
he
could
get
to
sleep
and
amongst
the
many
matters
that
so
agitated
his
mind
was
his
wonder
what
one
of
thomas
guests
could
want
with
his
father
being
unable
however
to
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
respecting
it
he
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
chapter
iv
in
which
winston
finds
an
old
friend
in
the
early
part
of
winston
career
when
he
worked
as
a
boy
on
the
plantation
of
his
father
he
had
frequently
received
great
kindness
at
the
hands
of
one
charles
ellis
who
was
often
employed
as
carpenter
about
the
premises
on
one
occasion
as
a
great
favour
he
had
been
permitted
to
accompany
ellis
to
his
home
in
savanah
which
was
but
a
few
miles
distant
where
he
remained
during
the
christmas
holidays
this
kindness
he
had
never
forgotten
and
on
his
return
to
georgia
from
new
orleans
he
sought
for
his
old
friend
and
found
he
had
removed
to
the
north
but
to
which
particular
city
he
could
not
ascertain
as
he
walked
homewards
the
strong
likeness
of
little
charlie
to
his
old
friend
forced
itself
upon
him
and
the
more
he
reflected
upon
it
the
more
likely
it
appeared
that
the
boy
might
be
his
child
and
the
identity
of
name
and
occupation
between
the
father
of
charlie
and
his
old
friend
led
to
the
belief
that
he
was
about
to
make
some
discovery
respecting
him
on
his
way
to
his
hotel
he
passed
the
old
state
house
the
bell
of
which
was
just
striking
ten
it
too
late
to
go
said
he
it
shall
be
the
first
thing
i
attend
to
in
the
morning
and
after
walking
on
a
short
distance
farther
he
found
himself
at
the
door
of
his
domicile
as
he
passed
through
the
little
knot
of
waiters
who
were
gathered
about
the
doors
one
of
them
turning
to
another
asked
ai
that
man
a
southerner
and
ai
he
in
your
rooms
ben
i
think
he
a
southerner
was
the
reply
of
ben
but
why
do
you
ask
allen
he
enquired
because
it
time
he
had
subscribed
something
replied
allen
the
funds
of
the
vigilance
committee
are
very
low
indeed
in
fact
the
four
that
we
helped
through
last
week
have
completely
drained
us
we
must
make
a
raise
from
some
quarter
and
we
might
as
well
try
it
on
him
winston
was
waiting
for
a
light
that
he
might
retire
to
his
room
and
was
quickly
served
by
the
individual
who
had
been
so
confidentially
talking
with
allen
after
giving
winston
the
light
ben
followed
him
into
his
room
and
busied
himself
in
doing
little
nothings
about
the
stove
and
let
me
unbutton
your
straps
sir
said
he
stooping
down
and
commencing
on
the
buttons
which
he
was
rather
long
in
unclosing
i
know
sir
dat
you
southern
gentlemen
ai
used
to
doing
dese
yer
things
for
youself
i
allus
makes
it
a
pint
to

yer
northern
folk

i
knows

to
it
and
ca
get
on
widout
it
i
am
not
one
of
that
kind
said
winston
as
ben
slowly
unbuttoned
the
last
strap
i
have
been
long
accustomed
to
wait
upon
myself
i
only
trouble
you
to
bring
me
up
a
glass
of
fresh
water
and
then
i
shall
have
done
with
you
for
the
night
better
let
me
make
you
up
a
little
fire

nights

continued
ben
i
know
you
must
feel
i
does
myself
i
from
the
south
too
are
you
replied
winston
with
some
interest
from
what
part
from
tuckahoe
county
virginia
nice
place
dat
never
having
been
there
i
ca
say
rejoined
winston
smiling
and
how
do
you
like
the
north
i
suppose
you
are
a
runaway
continued
he
oh
no
sir
no
sir
replied
ben
i
was
sot
free
and
i
often
wish
he
added
in
a
whining
tone
dat
i
was
back
agin
on
the
old
place
hai
got
no
kind
marster
to
look
after
me
here
and
i
has
to
work
drefful
hard
sometimes
ah
he
concluded
drawing
a
long
sigh
if
i
was
only
back
on
de
old
place
i
heartily
wish
you
were
said
winston
indignantly
and
wish
moreover
that
you
were
to
be
tied
up
and
whipped
once
a
day
for
the
rest
of
your
life
any
man
that
prefers
slavery
to
freedom
deserves
to
be
a
slave
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
go
out
of
the
room
sir
as
quick
as
possible
phew
said
the
astonished
and
chagrined
ben
as
he
descended
the
stairs
that
was
certainly
a
great
miss
continued
he
talking
as
correct
english
and
with
as
pure
northern
an
accent
as
any
one
could
boast
we
have
made
a
great
mistake
this
time
a
very
queer
kind
of
southerner
that
is
i
afraid
we
took
the
wrong
pig
by
the
ear
and
as
he
concluded
he
betook
himself
to
the
group
of
gentlemen
before
mentioned
to
whom
he
related
the
incident
that
had
just
occurred
quite
a
severe
fall
that
i
should
say
remarked
allen
perhaps
we
have
made
a
mistake
and
he
is
not
a
southerner
after
all
well
he
is
registered
from
new
orleans
and
i
thought
he
was
a
good
one
to
try
it
on
it
a
clear
case
we
missed
it
this
time
exclaimed
one
of
the
party
and
i
hope
ben
when
you
found
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
you
did
not
say
too
much
laws
no
rejoined
ben
do
you
think
i
a
fool
as
soon
as
i
heard
him
say
what
he
did
i
was
glad
to
get
off
i
felt
cheap
enough
now
mind
i
tell
you
any
one
could
have
bought
me
for
a
shilling
now
it
must
be
here
related
that
most
of
the
waiters
employed
in
this
hotel
were
also
connected
with
the
vigilance
committee
of
the
railroad
company
a
society
formed
for
the
assistance
of
fugitive
slaves
by
their
efforts
and
by
the
timely
information
it
was
often
in
their
power
to
give
many
a
poor
slave
was
enabled
to
escape
from
the
clutches
of
his
pursuers
the
house
in
which
they
were
employed
was
the
great
resort
of
southerners
who
occasionally
brought
with
them
their
slippery
property
and
it
frequently
happened
that
these
disappeared
from
the
premises
to
parts
unknown
aided
in
their
flight
by
the
very
waiters
who
would
afterwards
exhibit
the
most
profound
ignorance
as
to
their
whereabouts
such
of
the
southerners
as
brought
no
servants
with
them
were
made
to
contribute
unconsciously
and
most
amusingly
to
the
escape
of
those
of
their
friends
when
a
gentleman
presented
himself
at
the
bar
wearing
boots
entirely
too
small
for
him
with
his
hat
so
far
down
upon
his
forehead
as
almost
to
obscure
his
eyes
and
whose
mouth
was
filled
with
oaths
and
tobacco
he
was
generally
looked
upon
as
a
favourable
specimen
to
operate
upon
and
if
he
cursed
the
waiters
addressed
any
old
man
amongst
them
as
boy
and
was
continually
drinking
and
they
were
sure
of
their
man
and
then
would
tell
him
the
most
astonishing
and
distressing
tales
of
their
destitution
expressing
almost
with
tears
in
their
eyes
their
deep
desire
to
return
to
their
former
masters
whilst
perhaps
the
person
from
whose
mouth
this
tale
of
woe
proceeded
had
been
born
in
a
neighbouring
street
and
had
never
been
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
this
flattering
testimony
in
favour
of
the
peculiar
institution
generally
had
the
effect
of
extracting
a
dollar
or
two
from
the
purse
of
the
sympathetic
southerner
which
money
went
immediately
into
the
coffers
of
the
vigilance
committee
footnote
the
line
dividing
the
free
from
the
slave
states
it
was
this
course
of
conduct
they
were
about
to
pursue
with
winston
not
because
he
exhibited
in
person
or
manners
any
of
the
peculiarities
but
from
his
being
registered
from
new
orleans
the
following
morning
as
soon
as
he
had
breakfasted
he
started
in
search
of
ellis
the
address
was
little
and
by
diligently
inquiring
he
at
length
discovered
the
required
place
after
climbing
up
a
long
flight
of
stairs
on
the
outside
of
an
old
wooden
building
he
found
himself
before
a
door
on
which
was
written
charles
ellis
carpenter
and
joiner
on
opening
it
he
ushered
himself
into
the
presence
of
an
elderly
coloured
man
who
was
busily
engaged
in
planing
off
a
plank
as
soon
as
winston
saw
his
face
fully
he
recognized
him
as
his
old
friend
the
hair
had
grown
grey
and
the
form
was
also
a
trifle
bent
but
he
would
have
known
him
amongst
a
thousand
springing
forward
he
grasped
his
hand
exclaiming
my
dear
old
friend
do
you
know
me
ellis
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looked
at
him
intently
for
a
few
moments
but
seemed
no
wiser
from
his
scrutiny
the
tears
started
to
winston
eyes
as
he
said
many
a
kind
word
i
indebted
to
you
for
i
am
george
winston
do
you
remember
little
george
that
used
to
live
on
the
carter
estate
why
bless
me
it
ca
be
that
you
are
the
little
fellow
that
used
to
go
home
with
me
sometimes
to
savanah
and
that
was
sold
to
go
to
new
orleans
yes
the
same
boy
i
been
through
a
variety
of
changes
since
then
i
should
think
you
had
smilingly
replied
ellis
and
judging
from
appearances
very
favourable
ones
why
i
took
you
for
a
white
man
and
you
are
a
white
man
as
far
as
complexion
is
concerned
laws
child
he
continued
laying
his
hand
familiarly
on
winston
shoulders
how
you
have
changed
i
should
never
have
known
you
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
quite
a
shaver
running
about
in
a
long
tow
shirt
and
regarding
a
hat
and
shoes
as
articles
of
luxury
far
beyond
your
reach
and
now
said
ellis
gazing
at
him
with
admiring
eyes
just
to
look
at
you
why
you
are
as
fine
a
looking
man
as
one
would
wish
to
see
in
a
day
travel
often
thought
of
you
it
was
only
the
other
day
i
was
talking
to
my
wife
and
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
she
although
a
great
deal
older
than
your
cousin
emily
used
to
be
a
sort
of
playmate
of
hers
poor
emily
we
heard
she
was
sold
at
public
sale
in
savanah
did
you
ever
learn
what
became
of
her
oh
yes
i
saw
her
about
two
months
since
when
on
my
way
from
new
orleans
you
remember
old
colonel
garie
well
his
son
bought
her
and
is
living
with
her
they
have
two
children
she
is
very
happy
i
really
love
him
he
is
the
most
kind
and
affectionate
fellow
in
the
world
there
is
nothing
he
would
not
do
to
make
her
happy
emily
will
be
so
delighted
to
know
that
i
have
seen
your
wife
but
who
is
mrs
ellis
any
one
that
i
know
i
do
not
know
that
you
are
acquainted
with
her
but
you
should
remember
her
mother
old
nanny
tobert
as
she
was
called
she
kept
a
little
confectionery
almost
every
one
in
savanah
knew
her
i
ca
say
i
do
replied
winston
reflectively
she
came
here
continued
ellis
some
years
ago
and
died
soon
after
her
arrival
her
daughter
went
to
live
with
the
thomases
an
old
philadelphia
family
and
it
was
from
their
house
i
married
her
thomases
repeated
winston
that
is
where
i
saw
your
boy
he
is
the
image
of
you
and
how
came
you
there
asked
ellis
with
a
look
of
surprise
in
the
most
natural
manner
possible
i
was
invited
there
to
dinner
yesterday
the
bright
face
of
your
boy
attracted
my
attention
so
i
inquired
his
name
and
that
led
to
the
discovery
of
yourself
and
do
the
thomases
know
you
are
a
coloured
man
asked
ellis
almost
speechless
with
astonishment
i
rather
think
not
laughingly
rejoined
winston
it
is
a
great
risk
you
run
to
be
passing
for
white
in
that
way
said
ellis
with
a
grave
look
but
how
did
you
manage
to
get
introduced
to
that
set
they
are
our
very
first
people
it
is
a
long
story
was
winston
reply
and
he
then
as
briefly
as
he
could
related
all
that
had
occurred
to
himself
since
they
last
met
and
now
continued
he
as
he
finished
his
recital
i
want
to
know
all
about
you
and
your
family
and
i
also
want
to
see
something
of
the
coloured
people
since
i
been
in
the
north
i
met
none
but
whites
i
not
going
to
return
to
new
orleans
to
remain
i
here
in
search
of
a
home
i
wish
to
find
some
place
to
settle
down
in
for
life
where
i
shall
not
labour
under
as
many
disadvantages
as
i
must
struggle
against
in
the
south
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
rejoined
ellis
if
you
should
settle
down
here
you
have
to
be
either
one
thing
or
other
white
or
coloured
either
you
must
live
exclusively
amongst
coloured
people
or
go
to
the
whites
and
remain
with
them
but
to
do
the
latter
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
it
must
never
be
known
that
you
have
a
drop
of
african
blood
in
your
veins
or
you
would
be
shunned
as
if
you
were
a
pestilence
no
matter
how
fair
in
complexion
or
how
white
you
may
be
i
have
not
as
yet
decided
on
trying
the
experiment
and
i
hardly
think
it
probable
i
shall
rejoined
winston
as
he
said
this
he
took
out
his
watch
and
was
astonished
to
find
how
very
long
his
visit
had
been
he
therefore
gave
his
hand
to
ellis
and
promised
to
return
at
six
and
accompany
him
home
to
visit
his
family
as
he
was
leaving
the
shop
ellis
remarked
george
you
have
not
said
a
word
respecting
your
mother
his
face
flushed
and
the
tears
started
in
his
eyes
as
he
replied
in
a
broken
voice
she
dead
only
think
ellis
she
died
within
a
stone
throw
of
me
and
i
searching
for
her
all
the
while
i
never
speak
of
it
unless
compelled
it
is
too
harrowing
it
was
a
great
trial
to
me
it
almost
broke
my
heart
to
think
that
she
perished
miserably
so
near
me
whilst
i
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
every
luxury
oh
if
she
could
only
have
lived
to
see
me
as
i
am
now
continued
he
but
he
ordered
it
otherwise
and
we
must
bow
was
god
will
it
should
be
so
good
bye
till
evening
i
shall
see
you
again
at
six
great
was
the
surprise
of
ellis
and
her
daughters
on
learning
from
ellis
when
he
came
home
to
dinner
of
the
events
of
the
morning
and
great
was
the
agitation
caused
by
the
announcement
of
the
fact
that
his
friend
was
to
be
their
guest
in
the
evening
ellis
proposed
inviting
some
of
their
acquaintances
to
meet
him
but
to
this
project
her
husband
objected
saying
he
wanted
to
have
a
quiet
evening
with
him
and
to
talk
over
old
times
and
that
persons
who
were
entire
strangers
to
him
would
only
be
a
restraint
upon
them
caddy
seemed
quite
put
out
by
the
announcement
of
the
intended
visit
she
declared
that
nothing
was
fit
to
be
seen
that
the
house
was
in
a
state
of
disorder
shocking
to
behold
and
that
there
was
scarce
a
place
in
it
fit
to
sit
down
in
and
she
forthwith
began
to
prepare
for
an
afternoon
vigorous
scrubbing
and
cleaning
just
let
things
remain
as
they
are
will
you
caddy
dear
said
her
father
please
be
quiet
until
i
get
out
of
the
house
he
continued
as
she
began
to
make
unmistakeable
demonstrations
towards
raising
a
dust
in
a
few
moments
you
shall
have
the
house
to
yourself
only
give
me
time
to
finish
my
dinner
in
peace
esther
her
mother
and
their
sewing
were
summarily
banished
to
an
upstairs
room
whilst
caddy
took
undivided
possession
of
the
little
parlour
which
she
soon
brought
into
an
astonishing
state
of
cleanliness
the
ornaments
were
arranged
at
exact
distances
from
the
corners
of
the
mantelpiece
the
was
polished
until
it
appeared
to
be
without
spot
or
blemish
and
its
gilt
frame
was
newly
adorned
with
cut
paper
to
protect
it
from
the
flies
the
best
china
was
brought
out
carefully
dusted
and
set
upon
the
waiter
and
all
things
within
doors
placed
in
a
state
of
forwardness
to
receive
their
expected
guest
the
were
however
not
as
white
and
clean
as
they
might
be
and
that
circumstance
pressed
upon
caddy
mind
she
therefore
determined
to
give
them
a
hasty
wipe
before
retiring
to
dress
for
the
evening
having
done
this
and
dressed
herself
to
her
satisfaction
she
came
down
stairs
to
prepare
the
refreshments
for
tea
in
doing
this
she
continually
found
herself
exposing
her
new
silk
dress
to
great
risks
she
therefore
donned
an
old
petticoat
over
her
skirt
and
tied
an
old
silk
handkerchief
over
her
head
to
protect
her
hair
from
flying
particles
of
dust
and
thus
arrayed
she
passed
the
time
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
frequently
looking
out
of
the
window
to
see
if
her
father
and
their
guest
were
approaching
in
one
of
these
excursions
she
to
her
intense
indignation
found
a
beggar
boy
endeavouring
to
draw
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
an
illustration
of
a
upon
her
so
recently
cleaned
you
young
villain
she
almost
screamed
go
away
from
there
how
dare
you
make
those
marks
upon
the
steps
go
off
at
once
or
i
give
you
to
a
constable
to
these
behests
the
daring
young
gentleman
only
returned
a
contemptuous
laugh
and
put
his
thumb
to
his
nose
in
the
most
provoking
manner
ai
you
going
continued
the
irate
caddy
almost
choked
with
wrath
at
the
sight
of
the
steps
over
which
she
had
so
recently
toiled
scored
in
every
direction
with
black
marks
just
wait
till
i
come
down
i
give
it
to
you
you
audacious
villain
you
she
cried
as
she
closed
the
window
i
see
if
i
ca
move
you
caddy
hastily
seized
a
broom
and
descended
the
stairs
with
the
intention
of
inflicting
summary
vengeance
upon
the
dirty
delinquent
who
had
so
rashly
made
himself
liable
to
her
wrath
stealing
softly
down
the
alley
beside
the
house
she
sprang
suddenly
forward
and
brought
the
broom
with
all
her
energy
down
upon
the
head
of
winston
who
was
standing
on
the
place
just
left
by
the
beggar
she
struck
with
such
force
as
to
completely
crush
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
was
about
to
repeat
the
blow
when
her
father
caught
her
arm
and
she
became
aware
of
the
awful
mistake
she
had
made
why
my
child
exclaimed
her
father
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
have
you
lost
your
senses
and
as
he
spoke
he
held
her
at
length
from
him
to
get
a
better
look
at
her
what
are
you
dressed
up
in
this
style
for
he
continued
as
he
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
and
then
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
at
her
comical
appearance
he
released
her
and
she
made
the
quickest
possible
retreat
into
the
house
by
the
way
she
came
out
bushing
breathless
upstairs
she
exclaimed
oh
mother
mother
i
done
it
now
they
come
and
i
beat
him
over
the
head
with
a
broom
beat
whom
over
the
head
with
a
broom
asked
ellis
oh
mother
i
so
ashamed
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
myself
i
struck
winston
with
a
broom
winston
the
gentleman
father
has
brought
home
i
really
believe
the
child
is
crazy
said
ellis
surveying
the
chagrined
girl
beat
winston
over
the
head
with
a
broom
how
came
you
to
do
it
oh
mother
i
made
a
great
mistake
i
thought
he
was
a
beggar
he
must
be
a
very
different
looking
person
from
what
we
have
been
led
to
expect
here
interrupted
esther
i
understood
father
to
say
that
he
was
very
gentlemanlike
in
appearance
so
he
is
replied
caddy
but
you
just
said
you
took
him
for
a
beggar
replied
her
mother
oh
do
bother
me
do
bother
me
my
head
is
all
turned
upside
down
do
esther
go
down
and
let
them
in
hear
how
furiously
father
is
knocking
oh
go
do
go
esther
quickly
descended
and
opened
the
door
for
winston
and
her
father
and
whilst
the
former
was
having
the
dust
removed
and
his
hat
straightened
ellis
came
down
and
was
introduced
by
her
husband
she
laughingly
apologized
for
the
ludicrous
mistake
caddy
had
made
which
afforded
great
amusement
to
all
parties
and
divers
were
the
jokes
perpetrated
at
her
expense
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
her
equanimity
having
been
restored
by
winston
assurances
that
he
rather
enjoyed
the
joke
than
otherwise
and
an
opportunity
having
been
afforded
her
to
obliterate
the
obnoxious
marks
from
the
she
exhibited
great
activity
in
forwarding
all
the
arrangements
for
tea
they
sat
a
long
while
round
the
table
much
time
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
given
to
the
demolition
of
the
food
before
them
being
occupied
by
the
elders
of
the
party
in
inquiries
after
mutual
friends
and
in
relating
the
many
incidents
that
had
occurred
since
they
last
met
tea
being
at
length
finished
and
the
things
cleared
away
ellis
gave
the
girls
permission
to
go
out
where
are
you
going
asked
their
father
to
the
library
company
room
is
their
last
lecture
i
thought
said
winston
that
coloured
persons
were
excluded
from
such
places
i
certainly
have
been
told
so
several
times
it
is
quite
true
replied
ellis
at
the
lectures
of
the
white
library
societies
a
coloured
person
would
no
more
be
permitted
to
enter
than
a
donkey
or
a
this
association
they
speak
of
is
entirely
composed
of
people
of
colour
they
have
a
fine
library
a
debating
club
chemical
apparatus
collections
of
minerals
they
have
been
having
a
course
of
lectures
delivered
before
them
this
winter
and
is
the
last
of
the
course
would
you
like
to
go
mr
winston
asked
ellis
who
had
a
mother
desire
to
secure
so
fine
an
escort
for
her
daughters
no
no
do
george
quickly
interposed
ellis
i
am
selfish
enough
to
want
you
entirely
to
myself
the
girls
will
find
beaux
enough
i
warrant
you
at
this
request
the
girls
did
not
seem
greatly
pleased
and
miss
caddy
who
already
in
imagination
had
excited
the
envy
of
all
her
female
friends
by
the
grand
she
was
to
make
at
the
lyceum
leaning
on
the
arm
of
winston
gave
her
father
a
by
no
means
affectionate
look
and
tying
her
with
a
hasty
jerk
started
out
in
company
with
her
sister
you
appear
to
be
very
comfortable
here
ellis
said
winston
looking
round
the
apartment
if
i
am
not
too
inquisitive
what
rent
do
you
pay
for
this
house
it
mine
replied
ellis
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
house
ground
and
all
bought
and
paid
for
since
i
settled
here
why
you
are
getting
on
well
i
suppose
remarked
winston
that
you
are
much
better
off
than
the
majority
of
your
coloured
friends
from
all
i
can
learn
the
free
coloured
people
in
the
northern
cities
are
very
badly
off
i
been
frequently
told
that
they
suffer
dreadfully
from
want
and
privations
of
various
kinds
oh
i
see
you
have
been
swallowing
the
usual
dose
that
is
poured
down
southern
throats
by
those
northern
who
seem
to
think
it
a
duty
they
owe
the
south
to
tell
all
manner
of
infamous
lies
upon
us
free
coloured
people
i
really
get
so
indignant
and
provoked
sometimes
that
i
scarcely
know
what
to
do
with
myself
badly
off
and
in
want
indeed
why
my
dear
sir
we
not
only
support
our
own
poor
but
assist
the
whites
to
support
theirs
and
enemies
are
continually
filling
the
public
ear
with
the
most
distressing
tales
of
our
destitution
only
the
other
day
the
colonization
society
had
the
assurance
to
present
a
petition
to
the
legislature
of
this
state
asking
for
an
appropriation
to
assist
them
in
sending
us
all
to
africa
that
we
might
no
longer
remain
a
burthen
upon
the
state
and
they
came
very
near
getting
it
too
had
it
not
been
for
the
timely
assistance
of
young
denbigh
the
son
of
judge
denbigh
they
would
have
succeeded
such
was
the
gross
ignorance
that
prevailed
respecting
our
real
condition
amongst
the
members
of
the
legislature
he
moved
a
postponement
of
the
vote
until
he
could
have
time
to
bring
forward
facts
to
support
the
ground
that
he
had
assumed
in
opposition
to
the
appropriation
being
made
it
was
granted
and
in
a
speech
that
does
him
honour
he
brought
forward
facts
that
proved
us
to
be
in
a
much
superior
condition
to
that
in
which
our
imaginative
enemies
had
described
us
ay
he
did
more
he
proved
us
to
be
in
advance
of
the
whites
in
wealth
and
general
intelligence
for
whilst
it
was
one
in
fifteen
amongst
the
whites
unable
to
read
and
write
it
was
but
one
in
eighteen
amongst
the
coloured
i
pretend
to
be
correct
about
the
figures
but
that
was
about
the
relative
proportions
and
also
that
we
paid
in
the
shape
of
taxes
upon
our
real
estate
more
than
our
proportion
for
the
support
of
paupers
insane
convicts
well
said
the
astonished
winston
that
is
turning
the
tables
completely
you
must
take
me
to
visit
amongst
the
coloured
people
i
want
to
see
as
much
of
them
as
possible
during
my
stay
i
do
what
i
can
for
you
george
i
am
unable
to
spare
you
much
time
just
at
present
but
i
put
you
in
the
hands
of
one
who
has
abundance
of
it
at
his
disposal
i
will
call
with
you
and
introduce
you
to
walters
who
is
walters
asked
winston
a
friend
of
mine
a
dealer
in
real
estate
oh
then
he
is
a
white
man
not
by
any
means
laughingly
replied
ellis
he
is
as
black
as
a
man
can
conveniently
be
he
is
very
wealthy
some
say
that
he
is
worth
half
a
million
of
dollars
he
owns
to
my
certain
knowledge
one
hundred
brick
houses
i
met
him
the
other
day
in
a
towering
rage
it
appears
that
he
owns
ten
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stock
in
a
railroad
extending
from
this
to
a
neighbouring
city
having
occasion
to
travel
in
it
for
some
little
distance
he
got
into
the
cars
the
conductor
seeing
him
there
ordered
him
out
he
refused
to
go
and
stated
that
he
was
a
shareholder
the
conductor
replied
that
he
did
not
care
how
much
stock
he
owned
he
was
a
nigger
and
that
no
nigger
should
ride
in
those
cars
so
he
called
help
and
after
a
great
deal
of
trouble
they
succeeded
in
ejecting
him
and
he
a
stockholder
it
was
outrageous
exclaimed
winston
and
was
there
no
redress
no
none
practically
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
institute
a
suit
against
the
company
and
as
public
opinion
now
is
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
obtain
a
verdict
in
his
favour
the
next
day
winston
was
introduced
to
walters
who
expressed
great
pleasure
in
making
his
acquaintance
and
spent
a
week
in
showing
him
everything
of
any
interest
connected
with
coloured
people
winston
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
acquaintances
he
made
and
the
kindness
and
hospitality
with
which
he
was
received
made
a
most
agreeable
impression
upon
him
it
was
during
this
period
that
he
wrote
the
glowing
letters
to
and
garie
the
effects
of
which
will
be
discerned
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
the
garies
decide
on
a
change
we
must
now
return
to
the
garies
whom
we
left
listening
to
description
of
what
he
saw
in
philadelphia
and
we
need
not
add
anything
respecting
it
to
what
the
reader
has
already
gathered
from
the
last
chapter
our
object
being
now
to
describe
the
effect
his
narrative
produced
on
the
evening
succeeding
the
departure
of
winston
for
new
orleans
and
garie
were
seated
in
a
little
arbour
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
and
which
commanded
a
magnificent
prospect
up
and
down
the
river
it
was
overshadowed
by
tall
trees
from
the
topmost
branches
of
which
depended
large
bunches
of
georgian
moss
swayed
to
and
fro
by
the
soft
spring
breeze
that
came
gently
sweeping
down
the
long
avenue
of
magnolias
laden
with
the
sweet
breath
of
the
flowers
with
which
the
trees
were
covered
a
climbing
rose
and
cape
jessamine
had
almost
covered
the
arbour
and
their
intermingled
blossoms
contrasting
with
the
rich
brown
colour
of
the
branches
of
which
it
was
constructed
gave
it
an
exceedingly
beautiful
and
picturesque
appearance
this
arbour
was
their
favourite
resort
in
the
afternoons
of
summer
as
they
could
see
from
it
the
sun
go
down
behind
the
low
hills
opposite
casting
his
gleams
of
golden
light
upon
the
tops
of
the
trees
that
crowned
their
summits
northward
where
the
chain
of
hills
was
broken
the
waters
of
the
river
would
be
brilliant
with
waves
of
gold
long
after
the
other
parts
of
it
were
shrouded
in
the
gloom
of
twilight
and
garie
sat
looking
at
the
children
who
were
scampering
about
the
garden
in
pursuit
of
a
pet
rabbit
which
had
escaped
and
seemed
determined
not
to
be
caught
upon
any
pretence
whatever
are
they
not
beautiful
said
garie
with
pride
as
they
bounded
past
him
there
are
not
two
prettier
children
in
all
georgia
you
do
seem
half
proud
enough
of
them
he
continued
looking
down
upon
his
wife
affectionately
garie
who
was
half
reclining
on
the
seat
and
leaning
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
replied
oh
yes
i
am
garie
i
sure
i
love
them
dearly
oh
so
dearly
continued
she
fervently
and
i
only
wish
here
she
paused
as
if
she
felt
she
had
been
going
to
say
something
that
had
better
remain
unspoken
you
only
wish
what
dear
you
were
going
to
say
something
rejoined
her
husband
come
out
with
it
and
let
me
hear
what
it
was
oh
garie
it
was
nothing
of
any
consequence
consequence
or
no
consequence
let
me
hear
what
it
was
dear
well
as
you
insist
on
hearing
it
i
was
about
to
say
that
i
wish
they
were
not
little
slaves
oh
em
em
exclaimed
he
reproachfully
how
can
you
speak
in
that
manner
i
thought
dear
that
you
regarded
me
in
any
other
light
than
that
of
a
master
what
have
i
done
to
revive
the
recollection
that
any
such
relation
existed
between
us
am
i
not
always
kind
and
affectionate
did
you
ever
have
a
wish
ungratified
for
a
single
day
if
it
was
in
my
power
to
compass
it
or
have
i
ever
been
harsh
or
neglectful
oh
no
dear
no
forgive
me
garie
do
pray
forgive
me
you
are
kindness
itself
believe
me
i
did
not
think
to
hurt
your
feelings
by
saying
what
i
did
i
know
you
do
not
treat
me
or
them
as
though
we
were
slaves
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
we
are
such
and
it
makes
me
very
sad
and
unhappy
sometimes
if
anything
should
happen
that
you
should
be
taken
away
suddenly
think
what
would
be
our
fate
heirs
would
spring
up
from
somewhere
and
we
might
be
sold
and
separated
for
ever
respecting
myself
i
might
be
indifferent
but
regarding
the
children
i
can
not
feel
so
tut
tut
em
do
talk
so
gloomily
do
you
know
of
any
one
now
who
has
been
hired
to
put
me
to
death
said
he
smiling
do
talk
so
dear
remember
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
it
was
only
this
morning
i
learned
that
celeste
you
remember
celeste
you
i
can
not
recall
her
last
name
no
dear
i
really
ca
say
that
i
do
remember
whom
you
refer
to
i
can
bring
her
to
your
recollection
i
think
continued
she
one
afternoon
last
fall
we
were
riding
together
on
the
when
you
stopped
to
admire
a
very
neat
cottage
before
the
door
of
which
two
pretty
children
were
playing
oh
yes
i
remember
something
about
it
i
admired
the
children
so
excessively
that
you
became
quite
jealous
i
do
remember
that
part
of
it
she
continued
but
let
me
tell
you
my
story
last
week
the
father
of
the
children
started
for
washington
the
cars
ran
off
the
track
and
were
precipitated
down
a
high
embankment
and
he
and
some
others
were
killed
since
his
death
it
has
been
discovered
that
all
his
property
was
heavily
mortgaged
to
old
macturk
the
worst
man
in
the
whole
of
savannah
and
he
has
taken
possession
of
the
place
and
thrown
her
and
the
children
into
the
from
which
they
will
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
at
a
sheriff
sale
who
can
say
that
a
similar
fate
may
never
be
mine
these
things
press
upon
my
spirit
and
make
me
so
gloomy
and
melancholy
at
times
that
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
shun
even
myself
lately
more
than
ever
have
i
felt
disposed
to
beg
you
to
break
up
here
and
move
off
to
some
foreign
country
where
there
is
no
such
thing
as
slavery
i
have
often
thought
how
delightful
it
would
be
for
us
all
to
be
living
in
that
beautiful
italy
you
have
so
often
described
to
me
or
in
france
either
you
said
you
liked
both
those
places
why
not
live
in
one
of
them
no
no
emily
i
love
america
too
much
to
ever
think
of
living
anywhere
else
i
am
much
too
thorough
a
democrat
ever
to
swear
allegiance
to
a
king
no
no
that
would
never
do
give
me
a
free
country
that
is
just
what
i
say
rejoined
garie
that
is
exactly
what
i
want
that
is
why
i
should
like
to
get
away
from
here
because
this
is
a
free
country
god
knows
it
is
not
oh
you
little
traitor
how
severely
you
talk
abusing
your
native
land
in
such
shocking
style
it
really
painful
to
hear
you
said
garie
in
a
jocular
tone
oh
love
rejoined
she
do
joke
it
not
a
subject
for
jesting
it
is
heavier
upon
my
heart
than
you
dream
of
would
you
like
to
live
in
the
free
states
there
is
nothing
particular
to
keep
you
here
and
only
think
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
the
children
and
garie
she
continued
in
a
lower
tone
nestling
close
to
him
as
she
spoke
and
drawing
his
head
towards
her
i
think
i
am
going
to
and
she
whispered
some
words
in
his
ear
and
as
she
finished
she
shook
her
head
and
her
long
curls
fell
down
in
clusters
over
her
face
garie
put
the
curls
aside
and
kissing
her
fondly
asked
how
long
have
you
known
it
dear
not
long
not
very
long
she
replied
and
i
have
such
a
yearning
that
it
should
be
born
a
free
child
i
do
want
that
the
first
air
it
breathes
should
be
that
of
freedom
it
will
kill
me
to
have
another
child
born
here
its
infant
smiles
would
only
be
a
reproach
to
me
oh
continued
she
in
a
tone
of
deep
feeling
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
give
birth
to
an
inheritor
of
chains
and
she
shuddered
as
she
laid
her
head
on
her
husband
bosom
garie
brow
grew
thoughtful
and
a
pause
in
the
conversation
ensued
the
sun
had
long
since
gone
down
and
here
and
there
the
stars
were
beginning
to
show
their
twinkling
light
the
moon
which
had
meanwhile
been
creeping
higher
and
higher
in
the
blue
expanse
above
now
began
to
shed
her
pale
misty
beams
on
the
river
below
the
tiny
waves
of
which
broke
in
little
circlets
of
silver
on
the
shore
almost
at
their
feet
garie
was
revolving
in
his
mind
the
conversation
he
had
so
recently
held
with
winston
respecting
the
free
states
it
had
been
suggested
by
him
that
the
children
should
be
sent
to
the
north
to
be
educated
but
he
had
dismissed
the
notion
well
knowing
that
the
mother
would
be
at
the
idea
of
parting
with
her
darlings
until
now
the
thought
of
going
to
reside
in
the
north
had
never
been
presented
for
his
consideration
he
was
a
southerner
in
almost
all
his
feelings
and
had
never
had
a
scruple
respecting
the
ownership
of
slaves
but
now
the
fact
that
he
was
the
master
as
well
as
the
father
of
his
children
and
that
whilst
he
resided
where
he
did
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
manumit
them
that
in
the
event
of
his
death
they
might
be
seized
and
sold
by
his
heirs
whoever
they
might
be
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
him
he
had
known
all
this
before
but
it
had
never
stood
out
in
such
bold
relief
until
now
what
are
you
thinking
of
garie
asked
his
wife
looking
up
into
his
face
i
hope
i
have
not
vexed
you
by
what
i
said
oh
no
dear
not
at
all
i
was
only
thinking
whether
you
would
be
any
happier
if
i
acceded
to
your
wishes
and
removed
to
the
north
here
you
live
in
good
style
you
have
a
luxurious
home
troops
of
servants
to
wait
upon
you
a
carriage
at
your
disposal
in
fact
everything
for
which
you
express
a
desire
i
know
all
that
garie
and
what
i
am
about
to
say
may
seem
ungrateful
but
believe
me
dear
i
do
not
mean
it
to
be
so
i
had
much
rather
live
on
crusts
and
wear
the
coarsest
clothes
and
work
night
and
day
to
earn
them
than
live
here
in
luxury
wearing
gilded
chains
carriages
and
fine
clothes
can
not
create
happiness
i
have
every
physical
comfort
and
yet
my
heart
is
often
heavy
oh
so
very
heavy
i
know
i
am
envied
by
many
for
my
fine
establishment
yet
how
joyfully
would
i
give
it
all
up
and
accept
the
meanest
living
for
the
children
freedom
and
your
love
but
emily
granted
we
should
remove
to
the
north
you
would
find
annoyances
there
as
well
as
here
there
is
a
great
deal
of
prejudice
existing
there
against
people
of
colour
which
often
exposes
them
to
great
inconveniences
yes
dear
i
know
all
that
i
should
expect
that
but
then
on
the
other
hand
remember
what
george
said
respecting
the
coloured
people
themselves
what
a
pleasant
social
circle
they
form
and
how
intelligent
many
of
them
are
oh
garie
how
i
have
longed
for
friends
we
have
visitors
now
and
then
but
none
that
i
can
call
friends
the
gentlemen
who
come
to
see
you
occasionally
are
polite
to
me
but
under
existing
circumstances
i
feel
that
they
can
not
entertain
for
me
the
respect
i
think
i
deserve
i
know
they
look
down
upon
and
despise
me
because
i
a
coloured
woman
then
there
would
be
another
advantage
i
should
have
some
female
society
here
i
have
none
the
white
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
will
not
associate
with
me
although
i
am
better
educated
thanks
to
your
care
than
many
of
them
so
it
is
only
on
rare
occasions
when
i
can
coax
some
of
our
more
cultivated
coloured
acquaintances
from
savannah
to
pay
us
a
short
visit
that
i
have
any
female
society
and
no
woman
can
be
happy
without
it
i
have
no
parents
nor
yet
have
you
we
have
nothing
we
greatly
love
to
leave
behind
no
strong
ties
to
break
and
in
consequence
would
be
subjected
to
no
great
grief
at
leaving
if
i
only
could
persuade
you
to
go
said
she
imploringly
well
emily
replied
he
in
an
undecided
manner
i
think
about
it
i
love
you
so
well
that
i
believe
i
should
be
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
your
happiness
but
it
is
getting
damp
and
chilly
and
you
know
said
he
smiling
you
must
be
more
than
usually
careful
of
yourself
now
the
next
evening
and
many
more
besides
were
spent
in
discussing
the
proposed
change
many
objections
to
it
were
stated
weighed
carefully
and
finally
set
aside
winston
was
written
to
and
consulted
and
though
he
expressed
some
surprise
at
the
proposal
gave
it
his
decided
approval
he
advised
at
the
same
time
that
the
estate
should
not
be
sold
but
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
some
trustworthy
person
to
be
managed
in
garie
absence
under
the
care
of
a
overseer
it
would
not
only
yield
a
handsome
income
but
should
they
be
dissatisfied
with
their
northern
home
they
would
have
the
old
place
still
in
reserve
and
with
the
knowledge
that
they
had
this
to
fall
back
upon
they
could
try
their
experiment
of
living
in
the
north
with
their
minds
less
harassed
than
they
otherwise
would
be
respecting
the
result
as
garie
reflected
more
and
more
on
the
probable
beneficial
results
of
the
project
his
original
disinclination
to
it
diminished
until
he
finally
determined
on
running
the
risk
and
he
felt
fully
rewarded
for
this
concession
to
his
wife
wishes
when
he
saw
her
recover
all
her
wonted
serenity
and
sprightliness
they
were
soon
in
all
the
bustle
and
confusion
consequent
on
preparing
for
a
long
journey
when
garie
determination
to
remove
became
known
great
consternation
prevailed
on
the
plantation
and
dismal
forebodings
were
entertained
by
the
slaves
as
to
the
result
upon
themselves
divers
were
the
lamentations
heard
on
all
sides
when
they
were
positively
convinced
that
massa
was
gwine
away
for
true
but
they
were
somewhat
pacified
when
they
learned
that
no
one
was
to
be
sold
and
that
the
place
would
not
change
hands
for
garie
was
a
very
kind
master
and
his
slaves
were
as
happy
as
slaves
can
be
under
any
circumstances
not
much
less
was
the
surprise
which
the
contemplated
change
excited
in
the
neighbourhood
and
it
was
commented
on
pretty
freely
by
his
acquaintances
one
of
them
to
whom
he
had
in
conversation
partially
opened
his
mind
and
explained
that
his
intended
removal
grew
out
of
anxiety
respecting
the
children
and
his
own
desire
that
they
might
be
where
they
could
enjoy
the
advantages
of
schools
sneered
almost
to
his
face
at
what
he
termed
his
notions
and
subsequently
in
relating
to
another
person
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
garie
spoke
of
him
as
a
fool
led
by
the
nose
by
a
yaller
wench
why
ca
he
act
he
said
like
other
men
who
happen
to
have
children
breed
them
up
for
the
market
and
sell
them
and
he
might
have
added
as
i
do
for
he
was
well
known
to
have
so
acted
by
two
or
three
of
his
own
tawny
offspring
garie
at
the
suggestion
of
winston
wrote
to
walters
to
procure
them
a
small
but
neat
and
comfortable
house
in
philadelphia
which
when
procured
he
was
to
commit
to
the
care
of
and
ellis
who
were
to
have
it
furnished
and
made
ready
to
receive
him
and
his
family
on
their
arrival
as
garie
desired
to
save
his
wife
as
much
as
possible
from
the
care
and
anxiety
attendant
upon
the
arrangement
of
a
new
residence
one
most
important
matter
and
on
which
depended
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
his
people
was
the
selection
of
a
proper
overseer
on
its
becoming
known
that
he
required
such
a
functionary
numbers
of
individuals
who
aspired
to
that
dignified
and
honourable
office
applied
forthwith
and
as
it
was
also
known
that
the
master
was
to
be
absent
and
that
in
consequence
the
party
having
it
under
his
entire
control
could
cut
and
slash
without
being
interfered
with
the
value
of
the
situation
was
greatly
enhanced
it
had
also
another
irresistible
attraction
the
absence
of
the
master
would
enable
the
overseer
to
engage
in
the
customary
picking
and
stealing
operations
with
less
chance
of
detection
in
consequence
of
all
these
advantages
there
was
no
want
of
applicants
great
bony
new
england
men
traitors
to
the
air
they
first
breathed
came
anxiously
forward
to
secure
the
prize
mean
poor
white
georgians
who
were
able
to
show
testimonials
of
their
having
produced
large
crops
with
a
small
number
of
hands
and
who
could
tell
to
a
fraction
how
long
a
slave
could
be
worked
on
a
given
quantity
of
corn
also
put
in
their
claims
for
consideration
short
men
with
fierce
faces
who
gloried
in
the
fact
that
they
had
at
various
times
killed
refractory
negroes
also
presented
themselves
to
undergo
the
necessary
examination
garie
sickened
as
he
contemplated
the
motley
mass
of
humanity
that
presented
itself
with
such
eagerness
for
the
attainment
of
so
degrading
an
office
and
as
he
listened
to
their
vulgar
boastings
and
brutal
language
he
blushed
to
think
that
such
men
were
his
countrymen
never
until
now
had
he
had
occasion
for
an
overseer
he
was
not
ambitious
of
being
known
to
produce
the
largest
crop
to
the
acre
and
his
hands
had
never
been
driven
to
that
shocking
extent
so
common
with
his
neighbours
he
had
been
his
own
manager
assisted
by
an
old
negro
called
ephraim
most
generally
known
as
eph
and
to
him
had
been
entrusted
the
task
of
immediately
superintending
the
hands
engaged
in
the
cultivation
of
the
estate
this
old
man
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
children
and
clarence
who
used
to
accompany
him
on
his
pony
over
the
estate
regarded
him
as
the
most
wonderful
and
accomplished
coloured
gentleman
in
existence
eph
was
in
a
state
of
great
perturbation
at
the
anticipated
change
and
he
earnestly
sought
to
be
permitted
to
accompany
them
to
the
north
garie
was
however
obliged
to
refuse
his
request
as
he
said
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
place
could
get
on
without
him
an
overseer
being
at
last
procured
whose
appearance
and
manners
betokened
a
better
heart
than
that
of
any
who
had
yet
applied
for
the
situation
and
who
was
also
for
skill
and
honesty
nothing
now
remained
to
prevent
garie
early
departure
chapter
vi
pleasant
news
one
evening
ellis
was
reading
the
newspaper
and
ellis
and
the
girls
were
busily
engaged
in
sewing
when
who
should
come
in
but
walters
who
had
entered
without
ceremony
at
the
front
door
which
had
been
left
open
owing
to
the
unusual
heat
of
the
weather
here
you
all
are
hard
at
work
exclaimed
he
in
his
usual
hearty
manner
accepting
at
the
same
time
the
chair
offered
to
him
by
esther
come
now
continued
he
lay
aside
your
work
and
newspapers
for
i
have
great
news
to
communicate
indeed
what
is
it
what
can
it
be
cried
the
three
females
almost
in
a
breath
do
let
us
hear
it
oh
said
walters
in
a
provokingly
slow
tone
i
do
think
tell
you
it
may
injure
your
rest
it
will
keep
till
now
that
is
always
the
way
with
walters
said
caddy
pettishly
he
always
rouses
one
curiosity
and
then
refuses
to
gratify
it
he
is
so
tantalizing
sometimes
i
tell
you
this
much
said
he
looking
slily
at
caddy
it
is
connected
with
a
gentleman
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
taken
for
a
beggar
and
who
was
beaten
over
the
head
in
consequence
by
a
young
lady
of
my
acquaintance
now
father
has
been
telling
you
that
exclaimed
caddy
looking
confused
and
i
do
thank
him
for
it
either
i
hear
of
that
everywhere
i
go
even
the
burtons
know
of
it
walters
now
looked
round
the
room
as
though
he
missed
some
one
and
finally
exclaimed
where
is
charlie
i
thought
i
missed
somebody
where
is
my
boy
we
have
put
him
out
to
live
at
thomas
answered
ellis
hesitatingly
for
she
knew
walters
feelings
respecting
the
common
practice
of
sending
little
coloured
boys
to
service
it
is
a
very
good
place
for
him
continued
she
a
most
excellent
place
that
is
too
bad
rejoined
walters
too
bad
it
is
a
shame
to
make
a
servant
of
a
bright
clever
boy
like
that
why
ellis
man
how
came
you
to
consent
to
his
going
the
boy
should
be
at
school
it
really
does
seem
to
me
that
you
people
who
have
good
and
smart
boys
take
the
very
course
to
ruin
them
the
worst
thing
you
can
do
with
a
boy
of
his
age
is
to
put
him
at
service
once
get
a
boy
into
the
habit
of
working
for
a
stipend
and
depend
upon
it
when
he
arrives
at
manhood
he
will
think
that
if
he
can
secure
so
much
a
month
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
will
be
perfectly
happy
how
would
you
like
him
to
be
a
subservient
old
numskull
like
that
old
robberts
of
theirs
here
esther
interrupted
walters
by
saying
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
express
yourself
in
that
manner
walters
very
glad
charlie
is
such
a
bright
active
little
fellow
i
hate
to
have
him
living
there
as
a
servant
and
he
dislikes
it
too
as
much
as
any
one
can
i
do
wish
mother
would
take
him
away
hush
esther
said
her
mother
sharply
your
mother
lived
at
service
and
no
one
ever
thought
the
worse
of
her
for
it
esther
looked
abashed
and
did
not
attempt
to
say
anything
farther
now
look
here
ellen
said
walters
he
called
her
ellen
for
he
had
been
long
intimate
with
the
family
if
you
ca
get
on
without
the
earning
something
why
do
you
do
as
white
women
and
men
do
do
you
ever
find
them
sending
their
boys
out
as
servants
no
they
rather
give
them
a
stock
of
matches
blacking
newspapers
or
apples
and
start
them
out
to
sell
them
what
is
the
result
the
boy
that
learns
to
sell
matches
soon
learns
to
sell
other
things
he
learns
to
make
bargains
he
becomes
a
small
trader
then
a
merchant
then
a
millionaire
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
one
who
had
made
a
fortune
at
service
where
would
i
or
ellis
have
been
had
we
been
hired
out
all
our
lives
at
so
much
a
month
it
begets
a
feeling
of
dependence
to
place
a
boy
in
such
a
situation
and
rely
upon
it
if
he
stays
there
long
it
will
spoil
him
for
anything
better
all
his
days
ellis
was
here
compelled
to
add
by
way
of
justifying
herself
that
it
was
not
their
intention
to
let
him
remain
there
permanently
his
father
only
having
given
his
consent
for
him
to
serve
during
the
vacation
well
do
let
him
stay
there
longer
i
pray
you
continued
walters
a
great
many
white
people
think
that
we
are
only
fit
for
servants
and
i
must
confess
we
do
much
to
strengthen
the
opinion
by
permitting
our
children
to
occupy
such
situations
when
we
are
not
in
circumstances
to
compel
us
to
do
so
thomas
may
tell
you
that
they
respect
their
old
servant
robberts
as
much
as
they
do
your
husband
but
they
do
nevertheless
i
believe
a
word
of
it
it
is
impossible
to
have
the
same
respect
for
the
man
who
cleans
your
boots
that
you
have
for
the
man
who
plans
and
builds
your
house
oh
well
walters
here
interposed
ellis
i
do
intend
the
boy
to
remain
there
so
do
get
yourself
into
an
unnecessary
state
of
excitement
about
it
let
us
hear
what
this
great
news
is
that
you
have
brought
oh
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
laughingly
replied
walters
at
the
same
time
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
a
letter
which
he
at
length
produced
here
he
continued
opening
it
is
a
letter
i
have
received
from
a
garie
enclosing
another
from
our
friend
winston
this
garie
writes
me
that
he
is
coming
to
the
north
to
settle
and
desires
me
to
procure
them
a
house
and
he
says
also
that
he
has
so
far
presumed
upon
an
early
acquaintance
of
his
wife
with
ellis
as
to
request
that
she
will
attend
to
the
furnishing
of
it
you
are
to
purchase
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
them
comfortable
and
i
am
to
foot
the
bills
what
you
do
mean
emily
winston
husband
said
the
astonished
ellis
i
ca
say
whose
husband
it
is
but
from
winston
letter
replied
walters
i
suppose
he
is
the
person
alluded
to
that
is
news
continued
ellis
only
think
she
was
a
little
mite
of
a
thing
when
i
first
knew
her
and
now
she
is
a
woman
and
the
mother
of
two
children
how
time
does
fly
i
must
be
getting
quite
old
concluded
she
with
a
sigh
nonsense
ellen
remarked
ellis
you
look
surprisingly
young
you
are
quite
a
girl
yet
why
it
was
only
the
other
day
i
was
asked
if
you
were
one
of
my
daughters
ellis
and
the
girls
laughed
at
this
sally
of
their
father
who
asked
walters
if
he
had
as
yet
any
house
in
view
there
is
one
of
my
houses
in
that
i
think
will
just
suit
them
the
former
tenants
moved
out
about
a
week
since
if
i
can
call
for
you
he
continued
turning
to
ellis
will
you
accompany
me
there
to
take
a
look
at
the
premises
it
is
a
dreadful
long
walk
replied
ellis
how
provoking
it
is
to
think
that
because
persons
are
coloured
they
are
not
permitted
to
ride
in
the
omnibuses
or
other
public
conveyances
i
do
hope
i
shall
live
to
see
the
time
when
we
shall
be
treated
as
civilized
creatures
should
be
i
suppose
we
shall
be
so
treated
when
the
millennium
comes
rejoined
walters
not
before
i
am
afraid
and
as
we
have
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
it
will
arrive
before
we
shall
have
to
walk
to
or
take
a
private
conveyance
at
any
rate
i
shall
call
for
you
at
ten
good
night
remember
at
ten
well
this
is
a
strange
piece
of
intelligence
exclaimed
ellis
as
the
door
closed
upon
walters
i
wonder
what
on
earth
can
induce
them
to
move
on
here
their
place
i
am
told
is
a
perfect
paradise
in
old
colonel
garie
time
it
was
said
to
be
the
finest
in
georgia
i
wonder
if
he
really
intends
to
live
here
permanently
i
ca
say
my
dear
replied
ellis
i
am
as
much
in
the
dark
as
you
are
perhaps
they
are
getting
poor
ellis
and
are
coming
here
because
they
can
live
cheaper
oh
no
wife
i
do
think
that
can
be
the
occasion
of
their
removal
i
rather
imagine
he
purposes
emancipating
his
children
he
can
not
do
it
legally
in
georgia
and
you
know
by
bringing
them
here
and
letting
them
remain
six
months
they
are
free
so
says
the
law
of
some
of
the
southern
states
and
i
think
of
georgia
the
next
morning
ellis
caddy
and
walters
started
for
it
was
a
very
long
walk
and
when
they
arrived
there
they
were
all
pretty
well
exhausted
oh
dear
exclaimed
ellis
after
walking
upstairs
i
am
so
tired
and
there
is
not
a
chair
in
the
house
i
must
rest
here
said
she
seating
herself
upon
the
stairs
and
looking
out
upon
the
garden
what
a
large
yard
if
ours
were
only
as
large
as
this
what
a
delightful
place
i
could
make
of
it
but
there
is
no
room
to
plant
anything
at
our
house
the
garden
is
so
very
small
after
they
were
all
somewhat
rested
they
walked
through
the
house
and
surveyed
the
rooms
making
some
favourable
commentary
upon
each
the
house
do
look
as
if
it
would
want
much
cleaning
said
caddy
with
a
tone
of
regret
so
much
the
better
i
should
say
suggested
walters
not
as
caddy
views
the
matter
rejoined
ellis
she
is
so
fond
of
that
i
positively
think
she
regards
the
cleanly
state
of
the
premises
as
rather
a
disadvantage
than
otherwise
they
were
all
however
very
well
pleased
with
the
place
and
on
their
way
home
they
settled
which
should
be
the
best
bedroom
and
where
the
children
should
sleep
they
also
calculated
how
much
carpet
and
oilcloth
would
be
necessary
and
what
style
of
furniture
should
be
put
in
the
parlour
i
think
the
letter
said
plain
neat
furniture
and
not
too
expensive
did
it
not
asked
ellis
i
think
those
were
the
very
words
replied
caddy
and
oh
mother
it
nice
to
have
the
buying
of
so
many
pretty
things
i
do
so
love
to
shop
particularly
with
some
one
else
money
rejoined
her
mother
with
a
smile
yes
or
one
own
either
when
one
has
it
continued
caddy
i
like
to
spend
money
under
any
circumstances
thus
in
conversation
relative
to
the
house
and
its
fixtures
they
beguiled
the
time
until
they
reached
their
home
on
arriving
there
ellis
found
robberts
awaiting
her
return
with
a
very
anxious
countenance
he
informed
her
that
thomas
wished
to
see
her
immediately
that
charlie
had
been
giving
that
estimable
lady
a
world
of
trouble
and
that
her
presence
was
necessary
to
set
things
to
rights
what
has
he
been
doing
asked
ellis
oh
lots
of
things
he
and
aunt
rachel
do
get
on
together
at
all
and
last
night
he
came
nigh
having
the
house
burned
down
over
our
heads
why
robberts
you
do
tell
me
so
what
a
trial
boys
are
sighed
ellis
he
got
on
first
rate
for
a
week
or
two
but
since
that
he
has
been
raising
satan
he
and
aunt
rachel
had
a
regular
brush
yesterday
and
he
has
actually
lamed
the
old
woman
to
that
extent
she
wo
be
able
to
work
for
a
week
to
come
dear
dear
what
am
i
to
do
said
the
perplexed
ellis
i
ca
go
up
there
immediately
i
am
too
tired
say
to
thomas
i
will
come
up
this
evening
i
wonder
concluded
she
what
has
come
over
the
boy
mother
you
know
how
cross
aunt
rachel
is
i
expect
she
has
been
him
he
is
so
that
he
never
would
behave
improperly
to
an
old
person
unless
goaded
to
it
by
some
very
harsh
usage
that
the
way
go
on
esther
find
some
excuse
for
your
angel
said
caddy
ironically
of
course
that
lamb
could
not
do
anything
wrong
and
according
to
your
judgment
he
never
does
but
i
tell
you
he
is
as
bad
as
any
other
boy
boys
are
boys
i
expect
he
has
been
tracking
over
the
floor
after
aunt
rachel
has
scrubbed
it
or
has
been
doing
something
equally
provoking
he
has
been
in
mischief
depend
upon
it
things
had
gone
on
very
well
with
master
charlie
for
the
first
two
weeks
after
his
introduction
into
the
house
of
the
fashionable
descendant
of
the
worthy
maker
of
leathern
breeches
his
intelligence
combined
with
the
quickness
and
with
which
he
performed
the
duties
assigned
him
quite
won
the
regard
of
the
venerable
lady
who
presided
over
that
establishment
it
is
true
she
had
detected
him
in
several
attempts
upon
the
peace
and
of
aunt
rachel
tom
but
with
tom
she
had
little
sympathy
he
having
recently
made
several
felonious
descents
upon
her
stores
of
cream
and
custards
in
fact
it
was
not
highly
probable
if
any
of
his
schemes
had
resulted
seriously
to
the
spiteful
of
aunt
rachel
that
thomas
would
have
been
overwhelmed
with
grief
or
disposed
to
inflict
any
severe
punishment
on
the
author
of
the
catastrophe
unfortunately
for
thomas
charlie
whilst
going
on
an
errand
had
fallen
in
with
his
ancient
friend
and
adviser
in
short
he
had
met
no
less
a
person
than
the
formerly
kinch
great
was
the
delight
of
both
parties
at
this
unexpected
meeting
and
warm
indeed
was
the
exchange
of
mutual
congratulations
on
this
auspicious
event
kinch
in
the
excess
of
his
delight
threw
his
hat
several
feet
in
the
air
nor
did
his
feelings
of
pleasure
undergo
the
least
abatement
when
that
dilapidated
portion
of
his
costume
fell
into
a
bed
of
lime
from
which
he
rescued
it
with
great
difficulty
and
at
no
little
personal
risk
hallo
kinch
old
fellow
how
are
you
cried
charlie
i
been
dying
to
see
you
why
have
you
been
up
why
i
did
come
up
often
but
that
old
witch
in
the
kitchen
would
let
me
see
you
she
abused
me
scandalous
i
wanted
to
pull
her
turban
off
and
throw
it
in
the
gutter
why
she
called
me
a
dirty
beggar
and
threatened
to
throw
cold
water
on
me
if
i
did
go
away
phew
ai
she
an
old
buster
why
i
never
knew
you
were
there
yes
continued
kinch
and
i
saw
you
another
time
hung
up
behind
the
carriage
i
declare
charlie
you
looked
so
like
a
little
monkey
dressed
up
in
that
coat
and
silver
buttons
that
i
liked
to
have
died
at
you
and
kinch
was
so
overcome
by
the
recollection
of
the
event
in
question
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
upon
a
to
recover
himself
oh
i
do
hate
to
wear
this
confounded
livery
said
charlie
dolefully
the
boys
scream
after
me
in
the
streets
and
call
me
jay
and
nigger
and
lots
of
other
names
i
feel
that
all
that
wanting
to
make
a
complete
monkey
of
me
is
for
some
one
to
carry
me
about
on
an
organ
what
do
you
wear
it
for
then
asked
kinch
because
i
ca
help
myself
that
the
reason
the
boys
plague
me
to
that
extent
sometimes
that
i
feel
like
tearing
the
things
into
bits
but
mother
says
i
must
wear
it
kinch
concluded
he
significantly
something
will
have
to
be
done
i
ca
stand
it
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
wig
do
you
asked
kinch
and
on
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
he
continued
just
try
that
on
and
see
how
it
goes
you
find
it
work
like
a
charm
it
a
regular
just
try
it
now
you
see
if
it
is
the
thing
to
do
the
business
for
you
i
determined
to
be
as
bad
as
i
can
rejoined
charlie
i
tired
enough
of
staying
there
that
old
aunt
rach
is
a
devil
i
do
believe
a
saint
from
heaven
could
get
on
with
her
expecting
we
have
a
pitched
battle
every
day
beguiling
the
time
with
this
and
similar
conversation
they
reached
the
house
to
which
charlie
had
been
despatched
with
a
note
after
which
he
turned
his
steps
homeward
still
accompanied
by
the
redoubtable
kinch
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
they
passed
some
boys
who
were
engaged
in
a
game
of
marbles
charlie
favourite
pastime
and
on
kinch
offering
him
the
necessary
stock
to
commence
play
he
launched
into
the
game
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
carriage
was
ordered
for
a
drive
within
an
hour
and
that
he
was
expected
to
fill
his
accustomed
place
in
the
rear
of
that
splendid
vehicle
once
immersed
in
the
game
time
flew
rapidly
on
thomas
awaited
his
return
until
her
patience
was
exhausted
when
she
started
on
her
drive
without
him
as
they
were
going
through
a
quiet
street
to
her
horror
and
surprise
prominent
amidst
a
crowd
of
dirty
boys
she
discovered
her
little
footman
with
his
elegant
blue
livery
covered
with
dirt
and
sketches
in
white
chalk
for
in
the
excitement
of
the
game
charlie
had
not
observed
that
kinch
was
engaged
in
drawing
on
the
back
of
his
coat
his
favourite
illustration
to
wit
a
skull
and
is
that
our
charlie
said
she
to
her
daughter
surveying
the
crowd
of
noisy
boys
through
her
i
really
believe
it
is
that
is
certainly
our
livery
pull
the
and
stop
the
carriage
now
robberts
had
been
pressed
into
service
in
consequence
of
absence
and
was
in
no
very
good
humour
at
being
compelled
to
air
his
rheumatic
old
shins
behind
the
it
can
therefore
be
readily
imagined
with
what
delight
he
recognized
the
delinquent
footman
amidst
the
crowd
and
with
what
alacrity
he
descended
and
pounced
upon
him
just
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
the
game
clutching
fast
hold
of
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
dragged
him
to
the
and
held
him
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
his
indignant
mistress
who
lifted
up
her
hands
in
horror
at
the
picture
he
presented
oh
you
wretched
boy
said
she
just
look
at
your
clothes
all
covered
with
and
bespattered
with
lime
your
livery
is
totally
ruined
and
your
knees
too
only
look
at
them
the
dirt
is
completely
ground
into
them
but
you
have
seed
his
back
marm
said
robberts
he
got
the
pirate
flag
drawn
on
it
that
boy
go
straight
to
the
devil
i
know
he
will
all
this
time
charlie
to
his
great
discomfiture
was
being
shaken
and
turned
about
by
robberts
in
the
most
unceremonious
manner
kinch
with
his
usual
audacity
was
meanwhile
industriously
engaged
in
tracing
on
coat
a
similar
picture
to
that
he
had
so
skilfully
drawn
on
charlie
to
the
great
delight
of
a
crowd
of
boys
who
stood
admiring
spectators
of
his
artistic
performances
the
coachman
however
observing
this
operation
brought
it
to
a
rather
hasty
conclusion
by
a
well
directed
cut
of
the
whip
across
the
fingers
of
the
daring
young
artist
this
so
enraged
kinch
that
in
default
of
any
other
missile
he
threw
his
cap
at
the
head
of
the
coachman
but
unfortunately
for
himself
the
only
result
of
his
exertions
was
the
lodgment
of
his
cap
in
the
topmost
bough
of
a
neighbouring
tree
from
whence
it
was
rescued
with
great
difficulty
what
we
do
with
him
asked
thomas
in
a
despairing
tone
as
she
looked
at
charlie
put
him
with
the
coachman
suggested
morton
he
ca
sit
there
the
horses
are
so
restive
and
the
seat
is
only
constructed
for
one
and
he
would
be
in
the
coachman
way
i
suppose
he
must
find
room
on
behind
with
robberts
i
wo
ride
on
the
old
carriage
cried
charlie
nerved
by
despair
i
wo
stay
here
nohow
i
going
home
to
my
mother
and
as
he
spoke
he
endeavoured
to
wrest
himself
from
robberts
grasp
put
him
in
here
said
thomas
it
would
never
do
to
let
him
go
for
he
will
run
home
with
some
distressing
tale
of
no
we
must
keep
him
until
i
can
send
for
his
mother
put
him
in
here
much
to
morton
disgust
charlie
was
bundled
by
robberts
into
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
where
he
sat
listening
to
the
scolding
of
thomas
and
her
daughter
until
they
arrived
at
home
he
remained
in
disgrace
for
several
days
after
this
adventure
but
as
thomas
well
knew
that
she
could
not
readily
fill
his
place
with
another
she
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
kindly
looked
over
this
first
offence
the
situation
was
however
growing
more
and
more
intolerable
aunt
rachel
and
he
had
daily
skirmishes
in
which
he
was
very
frequently
worsted
he
had
held
several
hurried
consultations
with
kinch
through
the
grating
of
the
cellar
window
and
was
greatly
cheered
and
stimulated
in
the
plans
he
intended
to
pursue
by
the
advice
and
sympathy
of
his
devoted
friend
master
kinch
efforts
to
console
charlie
were
not
without
great
risk
to
himself
as
he
had
on
two
or
three
occasions
narrowly
escaped
falling
into
the
clutches
of
robberts
who
well
remembered
kinch
unprecedented
attempt
upon
the
sacredness
of
his
livery
and
what
the
result
might
have
been
had
the
latter
fallen
into
his
hands
we
can
not
contemplate
without
a
shudder
these
conferences
between
kinch
and
charlie
produced
their
natural
effect
and
latterly
it
had
been
several
times
affirmed
by
aunt
rachel
that
dat
air
boy
was
gittin
too
high
gittin
bove
hissef
dat
he
was
gittin
more
and
more
aggriwatin
every
day
dat
she
itched
to
git
at
him
dat
she
nothin
else
but
what
she
be
to
take
hold
o
him
and
she
comported
herself
generally
as
if
she
was
crazy
for
the
conflict
which
she
saw
must
sooner
or
later
occur
charlie
unable
on
these
occasions
to
reply
to
her
remarks
without
precipitating
a
conflict
for
which
he
did
not
feel
prepared
sought
to
revenge
himself
upon
the
veteran
tom
and
such
was
the
state
of
his
feelings
that
he
bribed
kinch
with
a
large
lump
of
sugar
and
the
leg
of
a
turkey
to
bring
up
his
mother
jerry
a
fierce
young
cat
and
they
had
the
satisfaction
of
shutting
him
up
in
the
with
the
belligerent
tom
who
suffered
a
signal
defeat
at
jerry
claws
and
was
obliged
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
through
the
window
with
a
seriously
damaged
eye
and
with
the
fur
torn
off
his
back
in
numberless
places
after
this
charlie
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
aunt
rachel
frequently
bewail
the
condition
of
her
favourite
whose
deplorable
state
she
was
inclined
to
ascribe
to
his
influence
though
she
was
unable
to
bring
it
home
to
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
insure
his
conviction
chapter
vii
thomas
has
her
troubles
thomas
was
affected
as
silly
women
sometimes
are
with
an
intense
desire
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
for
this
object
she
gave
grand
dinners
and
large
evening
parties
to
which
were
invited
all
who
being
two
or
three
removes
from
the
class
whose
members
occupy
the
cobbler
bench
or
the
huckster
stall
felt
themselves
at
liberty
to
look
down
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
from
the
pinnacle
on
which
they
imagined
themselves
placed
at
these
social
gatherings
the
conversation
never
turned
upon
pedigree
and
if
any
of
the
guests
chanced
by
accident
to
allude
to
their
ancestors
they
spoke
of
them
as
members
of
the
family
who
at
an
early
period
of
their
lives
were
engaged
in
mercantile
pursuits
at
such
dinners
thomas
would
sit
for
hours
mumbling
dishes
that
disagreed
with
her
smiling
at
conversations
carried
on
in
villanous
french
of
which
language
she
did
not
understand
a
word
and
admiring
the
manners
of
young
men
who
got
tipsy
at
her
evening
parties
because
they
had
been
to
europe
and
were
therefore
considered
quite
men
of
the
world
these
parties
and
dinners
she
could
not
be
induced
to
forego
although
the
late
hours
and
fatigue
consequent
thereon
would
place
her
on
the
for
several
days
afterwards
as
soon
however
as
she
recovered
sufficiently
to
resume
her
place
at
the
table
she
would
console
herself
with
a
dinner
of
boiled
mutton
and
roasted
turnips
as
a
slight
compensation
for
the
unwholesome
french
dishes
she
had
compelled
herself
to
swallow
on
the
occasions
before
mentioned
amongst
the
other
modern
fashions
she
had
adopted
was
that
of
setting
apart
one
morning
of
the
week
for
the
reception
of
visitors
and
she
had
mortally
offended
several
of
her
oldest
friends
by
obstinately
refusing
to
admit
them
at
any
other
time
two
or
three
difficulties
had
occurred
with
robberts
in
consequence
of
this
new
arrangement
as
he
could
not
be
brought
to
see
the
propriety
of
saying
to
visitors
that
thomas
was
not
at
home
when
he
knew
she
was
at
that
very
moment
upstairs
peeping
over
the
banisters
his
obstinacy
on
this
point
had
induced
her
to
try
whether
she
could
not
train
charlie
so
as
to
fit
him
for
the
important
office
of
uttering
the
fashionable
and
truthless
not
at
home
with
unhesitating
gravity
and
decorum
and
after
a
series
of
mishaps
she
at
last
believed
her
object
was
effected
until
an
unlucky
occurrence
convinced
her
to
the
contrary
thomas
during
the
days
on
which
she
did
not
receive
company
would
have
presented
to
any
one
who
might
have
had
the
honour
to
see
that
venerable
lady
an
entirely
different
appearance
to
that
which
she
assumed
on
gala
days
a
white
handkerchief
supplied
the
place
of
the
curling
wig
and
the
tasty
french
cap
was
replaced
by
a
muslin
one
decorated
with
an
immense
border
of
ruffling
that
flapped
up
and
down
over
her
silver
spectacles
in
the
most
comical
manner
possible
a
short
flannel
gown
and
a
dimity
petticoat
of
very
antique
pattern
and
scanty
dimensions
completed
her
costume
thus
attired
and
provided
with
a
duster
she
would
make
unexpected
sallies
into
the
various
domestic
departments
to
see
that
everything
was
being
properly
conducted
and
that
no
were
perpetrated
at
times
when
it
was
supposed
she
was
elsewhere
she
showed
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
all
traps
set
to
give
intimation
of
her
approach
and
would
come
upon
aunt
rachel
so
stealthily
as
to
induce
her
to
declare
dat
old
thomas
put
her
more
in
mind
of
a
ghost
dan
of
any
other
libin
animal
one
morning
whilst
attired
in
the
manner
described
thomas
had
been
particularly
active
in
her
excursions
through
the
house
and
had
driven
the
servants
to
their
wits
ends
by
her
frequent
descents
upon
them
at
the
most
unexpected
times
thereby
effectually
depriving
them
of
the
short
breathing
intervals
they
were
anxious
to
enjoy
charlie
in
particular
had
been
greatly
harassed
by
her
and
was
sent
flying
from
place
to
place
until
his
legs
were
nearly
run
off
as
he
expressed
it
and
so
when
lord
cutanrun
who
was
travelling
in
america
to
give
his
estates
in
england
an
opportunity
to
recuperate
presented
his
card
charlie
in
revenge
showed
him
into
the
where
he
knew
that
thomas
was
busily
engaged
trimming
an
belying
on
the
explicit
order
she
had
given
to
say
that
she
was
not
at
home
she
did
not
even
look
up
when
his
lordship
entered
and
as
he
advanced
towards
her
she
extended
to
him
a
basin
of
dirty
water
saying
here
take
this
receiving
no
response
she
looked
up
and
to
her
astonishment
and
horror
beheld
not
charlie
but
lord
cutanrun
in
the
agitation
consequent
upon
his
unexpected
appearance
she
dropped
the
basin
the
contents
of
which
splashing
in
all
directions
sadly
discoloured
his
lordship
light
pants
and
greatly
damaged
the
elegant
carpet
oh
my
lord
she
exclaimed
i
did
could
would
and
unable
to
ejaculate
further
she
fairly
ran
out
of
the
apartment
into
the
entry
where
she
nearly
fell
over
charlie
who
was
enjoying
the
confusion
his
conduct
had
created
oh
you
limb
you
little
wretch
said
she
you
knew
i
was
not
at
home
why
where
are
you
now
he
asked
with
the
most
provoking
air
of
innocence
if
you
ai
in
the
house
now
you
never
was
never
mind
sir
said
she
never
mind
i
settle
with
you
for
this
do
stand
there
grinning
at
me
go
upstairs
and
tell
morton
to
come
down
immediately
and
then
get
something
to
wipe
up
that
water
o
dear
my
beautiful
carpet
and
for
a
lord
to
see
me
in
such
a
plight
oh
abominable
i
give
it
to
you
you
scamp
you
did
it
on
purpose
continued
the
indignant
thomas
do
deny
it
i
know
you
did
what
are
you
standing
there
for
why
do
you
call
mrs
morton
she
concluded
as
charlie
chuckling
over
the
result
of
his
trick
walked
leisurely
upstairs
that
boy
will
be
the
death
of
me
she
afterwards
said
on
relating
the
occurrence
to
her
daughter
just
to
think
after
all
the
trouble
i
had
teaching
him
when
to
admit
people
and
when
not
that
he
should
serve
me
such
a
trick
i
confident
he
did
it
purposely
alas
for
poor
thomas
this
was
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
annoyances
that
charlie
had
in
store
with
which
to
test
her
patience
and
effect
his
own
deliverance
a
few
days
after
one
of
their
grand
dinners
was
to
take
place
and
charlie
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
the
possibility
of
his
finding
some
opportunity
on
that
occasion
to
remove
the
old
lady
wig
feeling
confident
that
could
he
accomplish
that
feat
he
would
be
permitted
to
turn
his
back
for
ever
on
the
mansion
of
thomas
never
had
thomas
appeared
more
radiant
than
at
this
dinner
all
the
guests
whose
attendance
she
had
most
desired
were
present
a
new
set
of
china
had
lately
arrived
from
paris
and
she
was
in
full
anticipation
of
a
grand
triumph
now
to
charlie
had
been
assigned
the
important
duty
of
removing
the
cover
from
the
which
was
placed
before
his
mistress
and
the
little
rogue
had
settled
upon
that
moment
as
the
most
favourable
for
the
execution
of
his
purpose
he
therefore
secretly
affixed
a
nicely
crooked
pin
to
the
elbow
of
his
sleeve
and
as
he
lifted
the
cover
adroitly
hooked
it
into
her
cap
to
which
he
knew
the
wig
was
fastened
and
in
a
twinkling
had
it
off
her
head
and
before
she
could
recover
from
her
astonishment
and
lay
down
the
he
had
left
the
room
the
guests
stared
and
tittered
at
the
grotesque
figure
she
presented
her
head
being
covered
with
short
white
hair
and
her
face
as
red
as
a
peony
at
the
mortifying
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
charlie
presented
himself
and
handed
her
the
wig
with
an
apology
for
the
in
her
haste
to
put
it
on
she
turned
it
wrong
side
foremost
the
laughter
of
the
guests
could
now
no
longer
be
restrained
and
in
the
midst
of
it
thomas
left
the
room
encountering
charlie
as
she
went
she
almost
demolished
him
in
her
wrath
not
ceasing
to
belabour
him
till
his
outcries
became
so
loud
as
to
render
her
fearful
that
he
would
alarm
the
guests
and
she
then
retired
to
her
room
where
she
remained
until
the
party
broke
up
it
was
her
custom
after
these
grand
entertainments
to
make
nocturnal
surveys
of
the
kitchen
to
assure
herself
that
none
of
the
delicacies
had
been
secreted
by
the
servants
for
their
personal
use
and
refreshment
charlie
aware
of
this
took
his
measures
for
an
ample
revenge
for
the
beating
he
had
received
at
her
hands
at
night
when
all
the
rest
of
the
family
had
retired
he
hastily
descended
to
the
kitchen
and
by
some
process
known
only
to
himself
imprisoned
the
cat
in
a
stone
jar
that
always
stood
upon
the
dresser
and
into
which
he
was
confident
thomas
would
peep
he
then
stationed
himself
upon
the
stairs
to
watch
the
result
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
as
soon
as
she
thought
the
servants
were
asleep
she
came
softly
into
the
kitchen
and
after
peering
about
in
various
places
she
at
last
lifted
up
the
lid
of
the
jar
tom
tired
of
his
long
confinement
sprang
out
and
in
so
doing
knocked
the
lamp
out
of
her
hand
the
fluid
from
which
ignited
and
ran
over
the
floor
murder
fire
watch
screamed
the
thoroughly
frightened
old
woman
oh
help
help
fire
at
this
terrible
noise
nearly
every
one
in
the
household
was
aroused
and
hurried
to
the
spot
whence
it
proceeded
they
found
thomas
standing
in
the
dark
with
the
lid
of
the
jar
in
her
hand
herself
the
personification
of
terror
the
carpet
was
badly
burned
in
several
places
and
the
fragments
of
the
lamp
were
scattered
about
the
floor
what
has
happened
exclaimed
morton
who
was
the
first
to
enter
the
kitchen
what
is
all
this
frightful
noise
occasioned
by
oh
there
is
a
man
in
the
house
answered
thomas
her
teeth
chattering
with
fright
there
was
a
man
in
here
he
has
just
sprung
out
she
continued
pointing
to
the
pooh
pooh
that
nonsense
madam
replied
the
why
an
infant
could
not
get
in
there
much
less
a
man
i
tell
you
it
was
a
man
then
angrily
responded
thomas
and
he
is
in
the
house
somewhere
now
such
absurdity
muttered
morton
adding
in
a
louder
tone
why
my
dear
mamma
you
seen
a
mouse
or
something
of
the
kind
mouse
indeed
interrupted
the
old
lady
do
you
think
i
in
my
dotage
and
i
do
know
a
man
from
a
mouse
just
then
the
cat
whose
back
had
got
severely
singed
in
the
set
up
a
most
lamentable
caterwauling
and
on
being
brought
to
light
from
the
depths
of
a
closet
into
which
he
had
flown
his
appearance
immediately
discovered
the
share
he
had
had
in
the
transaction
it
must
have
been
the
cat
said
robberts
only
look
at
his
back
why
here
the
fur
is
singed
off
him
i
bet
anything
continued
he
that
air
boy
has
had
something
to
do
with
this
for
it
a
clear
case
that
the
cat
could
git
into
the
jar
and
then
put
the
lid
on
hissef
tom
inability
to
accomplish
this
feat
being
most
readily
admitted
on
all
sides
inquiry
was
immediately
made
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
charlie
his
absence
from
the
scene
being
rather
considered
as
evidence
of
participation
for
it
was
argued
if
he
had
been
unaware
of
what
was
to
transpire
the
noise
would
have
drawn
him
to
the
spot
at
once
as
he
was
always
the
first
at
hand
in
the
event
of
any
excitement
robberts
was
despatched
to
see
if
he
was
in
his
bed
and
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
the
bed
had
not
even
been
opened
search
was
immediately
instituted
and
he
was
discovered
in
the
closet
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
was
dragged
forth
shaken
pummelled
and
sent
to
bed
with
the
assurance
that
his
mother
should
be
sent
for
in
the
morning
to
take
him
home
and
keep
him
there
this
being
exactly
the
point
to
which
he
was
desirous
of
bringing
matters
he
went
to
bed
and
passed
a
most
agreeable
night
aunt
rachel
being
one
of
those
sleepers
that
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
can
rouse
until
their
customary
time
for
awaking
had
slept
soundly
through
the
stirring
events
of
the
past
night
she
came
down
in
the
morning
in
quite
a
placid
state
of
mind
expecting
to
enjoy
a
day
of
rest
as
she
had
the
night
before
sat
up
much
beyond
her
usual
time
to
set
matters
to
rights
after
the
confusion
consequent
on
the
dinner
party
what
was
her
astonishment
therefore
on
finding
the
kitchen
she
had
left
in
a
state
of
perfect
order
and
cleanliness
in
a
condition
that
resembled
the
preparation
for
an
annual
lord
bless
us
she
exclaimed
looking
round
what
on
yarth
has
happened
i
raly
dere
bin
a
fire
in
dis
house
and
i
never
knowed
a
word
of
it
why
i
might
have

burnt
up
in
my
own
bed
dere

pots
and
skillets
hauled
out
of
the
closet
ebery
ting
turned
upside
down
why
dere
bin
a
down
here
she
continued
as
she
surveyed
the
apartment
at
this
juncture
she
espied
tom
who
sat
licking
his
paws
before
the
fire
and
presenting
so
altered
an
appearance
from
the
events
of
the
night
as
to
have
rendered
him
unrecognizable
even
by
his
best
friend
strange
cat
in
de
house
making
himself
quite
at
home
at
dat
said
aunt
rachel
indignantly
her
wrath
already
much
excited
rose
to
the
boiling
point
at
what
she
deemed
a
most
daring
invasion
of
her
domain
she
therefore
without
ceremony
raised
a
broom
with
which
she
belaboured
the
astonished
tom
who
ran
frantically
from
under
one
chair
to
another
till
he
ensconced
himself
in
a
small
closet
from
which
he
pertinaciously
refused
to
be
dislodged
wo
come
out
of
dere
wo
you
said
she
i
see
if
i
ca
make
you
den
and
poor
tom
dodged
behind
pots
and
kettles
to
avoid
the
blows
which
were
aimed
at
him
at
last
thoroughly
enraged
by
a
hard
knock
on
the
back
he
sprang
fiercely
into
the
face
of
his
tormentor
who
completely
upset
by
the
suddenness
of
his
attack
fell
sprawling
on
the
floor
screaming
loudly
for
help
she
was
raised
up
by
robberts
who
came
running
to
her
assistance
and
on
being
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
her
outcries
replied
dere
a
strange
cat
in
de
house
wild
cat
too
i
raly
and
spying
tom
at
that
moment
beneath
the
table
she
made
another
dash
at
him
for
a
renewal
of
hostilities
why
that
tom
exclaimed
robberts
do
you
know
your
own
cat
oh
she
replied
dat
ar
is
tom
now
is
it
why
what
the
matter
wid
him
robberts
then
gave
her
a
detailed
account
of
the
transactions
of
the
previous
night
in
which
account
the
share
charlie
had
taken
was
greatly
enlarged
and
embellished
and
the
wrathful
old
woman
was
listening
to
the
conclusion
when
charlie
entered
hardly
had
he
got
into
the
room
when
without
any
preliminary
discussion
aunt
rachel
to
use
her
own
words
pitched
into
him
to
give
him
particular
fits
now
charlie
not
being
disposed
to
receive
particular
fits
made
some
efforts
to
return
the
hard
compliments
that
were
being
showered
upon
him
and
the
advice
of
kinch
providentially
occurring
to
him
respecting
an
attack
upon
the
understanding
of
his
venerable
antagonist
he
brought
his
hard
shoes
down
with
great
force
upon
her
pet
corn
and
by
this
de
completely
demolished
her
with
a
loud
scream
she
let
him
go
and
sitting
down
upon
the
floor
declared
herself
lamed
for
life
beyond
the
possibility
of
recovery
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
robberts
came
to
the
rescue
of
his
aged
coadjutor
and
seized
hold
of
charlie
who
forthwith
commenced
so
brisk
an
attack
upon
his
rheumatic
shins
as
to
cause
him
to
beat
a
hurried
retreat
leaving
charlie
sole
master
of
the
field
the
noise
that
these
scuffles
occasioned
brought
thomas
into
the
kitchen
and
charlie
was
marched
off
by
her
into
an
upstairs
room
where
he
was
kept
in
durance
vile
until
the
arrival
of
his
mother
thomas
had
a
strong
liking
for
charlie
not
as
a
boy
but
as
a
footman
he
was
active
and
intelligent
and
until
quite
recently
extremely
tractable
and
obedient
more
than
all
he
was
a
very
boy
and
when
dressed
in
the
thomas
livery
presented
a
appearance
she
therefore
determined
to
be
magnanimous
to
look
over
past
events
and
to
show
a
christian
and
forgiving
spirit
towards
his
delinquencies
she
sent
for
ellis
with
the
intention
of
desiring
her
to
use
her
maternal
influence
to
induce
him
to
apologize
to
aunt
rachel
for
his
assault
upon
her
corns
which
apology
thomas
was
willing
to
guarantee
should
be
accepted
as
for
the
indignities
that
had
been
inflicted
on
herself
she
thought
it
most
politic
to
regard
them
in
the
light
of
accidents
and
to
say
as
little
about
that
part
of
the
affair
as
possible
when
ellis
made
her
appearance
on
the
day
subsequent
to
the
events
just
narrated
thomas
enlarged
to
her
upon
the
serious
damage
that
aunt
rachel
had
received
and
the
urgent
necessity
that
something
should
be
done
to
mollify
that
important
individual
when
charlie
was
brought
into
the
presence
of
his
mother
and
thomas
the
latter
informed
him
that
wicked
as
had
been
his
conduct
towards
herself
she
was
willing
for
his
mother
sake
to
look
over
it
but
that
he
must
humble
himself
in
dust
and
ashes
before
the
reigning
sovereign
of
the
culinary
kingdom
who
making
the
most
of
the
injury
inflicted
on
her
toe
had
declared
herself
unfit
for
service
and
was
at
that
moment
ensconced
in
a
large
listening
to
the
music
of
her
favourite
whilst
a
temporary
cook
was
getting
up
the
dinner
under
her
immediate
supervision
and
direction
charlie
i
quite
ashamed
of
you
said
his
mother
after
listening
to
thomas
lengthy
statement
what
has
come
over
you
child
charlie
stood
biting
his
nails
and
looking
very
sullen
but
vouchsafed
them
no
mrs
thomas
is
so
kind
as
to
forgive
you
and
says
she
will
look
over
the
whole
affair
if
you
will
beg
aunt
rachel
pardon
come
now
continued
ellis
coaxingly
do
that
a
good
boy
yes
do
added
thomas
and
i
will
buy
you
a
handsome
new
suit
of
livery
this
was
too
much
for
charlie
the
promise
of
another
suit
of
the
detested
livery
quite
overcame
him
and
he
burst
into
tears
why
what
ails
the
boy
he
the
most
incomprehensible
child
i
ever
saw
the
idea
of
crying
at
the
promise
of
a
new
suit
of
clothes
any
other
child
would
have
been
delighted
concluded
thomas
i
do
want
your
old
uniform
said
charlie
and
i
wear
it
neither
and
as
for
aunt
rachel
i
do
care
how
much
she
is
hurt
i
only
sorry
i
did
smash
her
other
toe
and
i
see
her
skinned
and
be
skinned
myself
before
i
ask
her
pardon
both
thomas
and
charlie
mother
stood
aghast
at
this
unexpected
declaration
and
the
result
of
a
long
conference
held
by
the
two
was
that
charlie
should
be
taken
home
ellis
being
unable
to
withstand
his
tears
and
entreaties
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
on
his
way
out
he
made
a
face
at
aunt
rachel
who
in
return
threw
at
him
one
of
the
turnips
she
was
peeling
it
missed
the
object
for
which
it
was
intended
and
came
plump
into
the
eye
of
robberts
giving
to
that
respectable
individual
for
some
time
thereafter
the
appearance
of
a
in
livery
charlie
started
for
home
in
the
highest
spirits
which
however
became
considerably
lower
on
his
discovering
his
mother
view
of
his
late
exploits
was
very
different
from
his
own
ellis
fondness
and
admiration
of
her
son
although
almost
amounting
to
weakness
were
yet
insufficient
to
prevent
her
from
feeling
that
his
conduct
even
after
making
due
allowance
for
the
provocation
he
had
received
could
not
be
wholly
excused
as
mere
boyish
impetuosity
and
love
of
mischievous
fun
she
knew
that
his
father
would
feel
it
his
duty
not
only
to
reprimand
him
but
to
inflict
some
chastisement
and
this
thought
was
the
more
painful
to
her
from
the
consciousness
that
but
for
her
own
weak
compliance
with
thomas
request
her
boy
would
not
have
been
placed
in
circumstances
which
his
judgment
and
had
proved
insufficient
to
carry
him
through
the
day
therefore
passed
less
agreeably
than
charlie
had
anticipated
for
now
that
he
was
removed
from
the
scene
of
his
trials
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
his
behaviour
under
them
had
been
very
different
from
what
it
ought
to
have
been
and
this
had
the
salutary
effect
of
bringing
him
into
a
somewhat
humbler
frame
of
mind
when
his
father
returned
in
the
evening
therefore
charlie
appeared
so
that
even
caddy
could
scarcely
help
commiserating
him
especially
as
his
subdued
state
during
the
day
had
kept
him
from
committing
any
of
those
offences
against
tidiness
which
so
frequently
exasperated
her
ellis
though
very
strict
on
what
he
thought
points
of
duty
had
much
command
of
temper
and
was
an
affectionate
father
he
listened
therefore
with
attention
to
the
details
of
charlie
grievances
as
well
as
of
his
misdemeanours
and
some
credit
is
due
to
him
for
the
unshaken
gravity
he
preserved
throughout
although
he
secretly
acquitted
his
son
of
any
really
bad
intention
he
thought
it
incumbent
on
him
to
make
charlie
feel
in
some
degree
the
evil
consequences
of
his
unruly
behaviour
after
giving
him
a
serious
lecture
and
pointing
out
the
impropriety
of
taking
such
measures
to
deliver
himself
from
the
bondage
in
which
his
parents
themselves
had
thought
fit
to
place
him
without
even
appealing
to
them
he
insisted
on
his
making
the
apologies
due
both
to
thomas
and
aunt
rachel
although
he
was
fully
aware
that
both
had
only
got
their
deserts
and
further
intimated
that
he
would
not
be
reinstated
in
his
parents
good
graces
until
he
had
proved
by
his
good
conduct
and
docility
that
he
was
really
sorry
for
his
misbehaviour
it
was
a
severe
trial
to
charlie
to
make
these
apologies
but
he
well
knew
that
what
his
father
had
decided
upon
must
be
done
so
he
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
accompanied
by
his
mother
on
the
following
day
performed
his
penance
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
was
able
and
in
consideration
of
this
submission
his
father
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
greeted
him
with
all
his
usual
kindness
and
the
recollection
of
this
unlucky
affair
was
at
once
banished
from
the
family
circle
chapter
viii
trouble
in
the
ellis
family
since
the
receipt
of
garie
letter
ellis
and
caddy
had
been
busily
engaged
in
putting
the
house
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
their
reception
caddy
whilst
superintending
its
decoration
felt
herself
in
elysium
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
having
two
unfortunate
entirely
at
her
disposal
consequently
she
drove
them
about
and
worried
them
to
an
extent
unparalleled
in
any
of
their
former
experience
she
sought
for
and
discovered
on
the
windows
which
they
had
fondly
regarded
as
miracles
of
cleanliness
sundry
streaks
and
smears
and
detected
infinite
small
spots
of
paint
and
whitewash
on
the
floors
she
followed
them
upstairs
and
downstairs
and
tormented
them
to
that
extent
that
charlie
gave
it
as
his
private
opinion
that
he
should
not
be
in
the
least
surprised
on
going
up
there
to
find
that
the
two
old
women
had
made
away
with
caddy
and
hidden
her
remains
in
the
whilst
she
was
thus
engaged
to
charlie
was
assigned
the
duty
of
transporting
to
her
diurnal
portion
of
food
without
a
hearty
share
of
which
she
found
it
impossible
to
maintain
herself
in
a
state
of
efficiency
her
labours
in
chasing
the
women
about
the
house
being
of
a
rather
exhausting
nature
when
he
made
the
visits
in
question
charlie
was
generally
reconnoitred
by
his
sister
from
a
window
over
the
door
and
was
compelled
to
put
his
shoes
through
a
system
of
purification
devised
by
her
for
his
especial
benefit
it
consisted
of
three
courses
of
scraper
and
two
of
mat
this
being
considered
by
her
as
strictly
necessary
to
bring
his
shoes
to
such
a
state
of
cleanliness
as
would
entitle
him
to
admission
into
the
premises
of
which
she
was
the
temporary
mistress
charlie
on
two
or
three
occasions
finding
a
window
open
made
stealthy
descents
upon
the
premises
without
first
having
duly
observed
these
quarantine
regulations
whereupon
he
was
attacked
by
caddy
who
with
the
assistance
of
the
minions
under
her
command
so
shook
and
pummelled
him
as
to
cause
his
precipitate
retreat
through
the
same
opening
by
which
he
had
entered
and
that
too
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
as
to
make
the
whole
manoeuvre
appear
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
but
involuntary
feat
of
ground
and
lofty
tumbling
one
afternoon
he
started
with
his
sister
dinner
consisting
of
a
dish
of
which
she
was
particularly
fond
and
its
arrival
was
therefore
looked
for
with
unusual
anxiety
charlie
having
gorged
himself
to
an
almost
alarming
extent
did
not
make
the
haste
that
the
case
evidently
demanded
and
as
he
several
times
stopped
to
act
as
umpire
in
disputed
games
of
marbles
in
the
rules
of
which
he
was
regarded
as
an
authority
he
necessarily
consumed
a
great
deal
of
time
on
the
way
caddy
patience
was
severely
tried
by
the
long
delay
and
her
temper
at
no
time
the
most
amiable
gathered
bitterness
from
the
unprecedented
length
of
her
fast
therefore
when
he
at
length
appeared
walking
leisurely
up
swinging
the
kettle
about
in
the
most
reckless
manner
and
setting
it
down
on
the
pavement
to
play
over
the
her
wrath
reached
a
point
that
boded
no
good
to
the
young
trifler
now
whilst
charlie
had
been
giving
his
attention
to
the
difficulties
growing
out
of
the
games
of
marbles
he
did
not
observe
that
one
of
the
disputants
was
possessed
of
a
tin
kettle
in
appearance
very
similar
to
his
own
by
the
side
of
which
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
deposited
his
own
whilst
giving
a
practical
illustration
of
his
view
of
the
point
under
consideration
having
accomplished
this
to
his
entire
satisfaction
he
resumed
what
he
supposed
was
his
kettle
and
went
his
way
rejoicing
now
if
caddy
ellis
had
a
fondness
for
one
dish
more
than
any
other
it
was
for
haricot
with
plenty
of
carrots
and
knowing
she
was
to
have
this
for
her
dinner
she
to
use
her
own
pointed
expression
had
laid
herself
out
to
have
a
good
meal
she
had
even
abstained
from
her
customary
lunch
that
she
might
have
an
appetite
worthy
of
the
occasion
and
accordingly
long
ere
the
dinner
hour
approached
she
was
hungry
as
a
wolf
notwithstanding
this
fact
when
charlie
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
she
insisted
on
his
going
through
all
the
accustomed
forms
with
the
mat
and
scraper
before
entering
the
house
an
act
of
on
her
part
entirely
uncalled
for
as
the
day
was
remarkably
fine
and
charlie
boots
unusually
clean
he
received
two
or
three
by
no
means
gentle
shoves
and
pokes
as
he
entered
which
he
bore
with
unusual
indifference
making
not
the
slightest
effort
at
retaliation
as
was
his
usual
practice
the
fact
is
charlie
was
as
lions
are
supposed
to
be
quite
disinclined
for
a
fight
after
a
hearty
meal
so
he
followed
caddy
upstairs
to
the
second
story
here
she
had
got
up
an
extempore
by
placing
a
pasting
board
across
two
chairs
seating
herself
upon
a
stool
she
jerked
off
the
lid
of
the
kettle
and
to
her
horror
and
dismay
found
not
the
favourite
haricot
but
a
piece
of
a
crust
of
dry
bread
and
a
cold
potatoe
charlie
who
was
amusing
himself
by
examining
the
flowers
in
the
new
carpet
did
not
observe
the
look
of
surprise
and
disgust
that
came
over
the
countenance
of
his
sister
as
she
took
out
piece
by
piece
the
remains
of
some
repast
look
here
she
at
last
burst
forth
do
you
call
this
dinner
yes
said
charlie
in
a
deliberate
tone
and
a
very
good
one
too
i
should
say
if
you
ca
eat
that
dinner
you
ought
to
starve
it
one
of
mother
best
haricots
you
do
call
this
cold
potatoe
and
haricot
do
you
asked
caddy
angrily
at
this
charlie
looked
up
and
saw
before
her
the
refuse
scraps
which
she
had
indignantly
emptied
upon
the
table
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
he
got
up
and
looked
in
the
kettle
but
found
no
haricot
well
said
he
with
surprise
if
that
do
beat
me
i
saw
mother
fill
it
with
haricot
myself
i
clean
beat
about
it
tell
me
what
you
done
with
it
then
almost
screamed
the
angry
girl
i
really
do
know
what
has
become
of
it
he
answered
with
a
bewildered
air
i
saw
i
saw
i
i
you
saw
you
saw
replied
the
indignant
caddy
imitating
his
tone
and
taking
up
the
kettle
she
began
to
examine
it
more
closely
why
this
is
even
our
kettle
look
at
this
lid
i
sure
it
not
ours
been
stopping
somewhere
to
play
and
exchanged
it
with
some
other
boy
that
just
what
you
done
just
then
it
occurred
to
charlie
that
at
the
place
where
he
had
adjusted
the
dispute
about
the
marbles
he
had
observed
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
boys
a
kettle
similar
to
his
own
and
it
flashed
across
his
mind
that
he
had
then
and
there
made
the
unfortunate
exchange
he
broke
his
suspicion
to
caddy
in
the
gentlest
manner
at
the
same
time
edging
his
way
to
the
door
to
escape
the
storm
that
he
saw
was
brewing
the
loss
of
her
dinner
and
of
such
a
dinner
so
enraged
the
hungry
girl
as
to
cause
her
to
seize
a
brush
lying
near
and
begin
to
belabour
him
without
mercy
in
his
endeavour
to
escape
from
her
his
foot
was
caught
in
the
carpet
and
he
was
violently
precipitated
down
the
long
flight
of
stairs
his
screams
brought
the
whole
party
to
his
assistance
even
kinch
who
was
sitting
on
the
step
outside
threw
off
his
usual
dread
of
caddy
and
rushed
into
the
house
oh
take
me
up
piteously
cried
charlie
oh
take
me
up
i
almost
killed
in
raising
him
one
of
the
old
women
took
hold
of
his
arm
which
caused
him
to
scream
again
do
touch
my
arm
please
do
touch
my
arm
i
sure
broke
no
no
it
not
broke
only
sprained
or
a
little
twisted
said
she
and
seizing
it
as
she
spoke
she
gave
it
a
pull
and
a
wrench
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
all
right
again
at
this
charlie
face
turned
deathly
pale
and
he
fainted
outright
run
for
a
doctor
cried
the
now
caddy
run
for
the
doctor
my
brother
dead
and
bursting
into
tears
she
exclaimed
oh
i
killed
my
brother
i
killed
my
brother
do
make
so
much
fuss
child
soothingly
replied
one
of
the
old
women
he
worth
half
a
dozen
dead
folk
yet
lor
bless
you
child
he
only
fainted
water
was
procured
and
thrown
in
his
face
and
before
kinch
returned
with
the
doctor
he
was
quite
restored
to
consciousness
do
cry
my
little
man
said
the
physician
as
he
took
out
his
knife
and
ripped
up
the
sleeve
of
charlie
coat
do
cry
let
me
examine
your
arm
stripping
up
the
he
felt
it
carefully
over
and
shaking
his
head
physicians
always
shake
their
heads
pronounced
the
arm
broken
and
that
too
in
an
extremely
bad
place
at
this
information
charlie
began
again
to
cry
and
caddy
broke
forth
into
such
yells
of
despair
as
almost
to
drive
them
distracted
the
physician
kindly
procured
a
carriage
and
saw
charlie
comfortably
placed
therein
and
held
in
the
arms
of
kinch
with
the
lamenting
and
disheartened
caddy
on
the
opposite
seat
he
was
slowly
driven
home
the
house
was
quite
thrown
into
confusion
by
their
arrival
under
such
circumstances
ellis
for
a
wonder
did
not
faint
but
proceeded
at
once
to
do
what
was
necessary
ellis
was
sent
for
and
he
immediately
despatched
kinch
for
burdett
their
family
physician
who
came
without
a
moment
delay
he
examined
charlie
arm
and
at
first
thought
it
would
be
necessary
to
amputate
it
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
amputate
caddy
set
up
such
a
series
of
lamentable
howls
as
to
cause
her
immediate
ejectment
from
the
apartment
burdett
called
in
diggs
for
a
consultation
and
between
them
it
was
decided
that
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
save
the
injured
member
now
charlie
said
burdett
afraid
we
must
hurt
you
my
boy
but
if
you
have
any
desire
to
keep
this
arm
you
must
try
to
bear
it
i
bear
anything
to
save
my
arm
doctor
i
ca
spare
that
said
he
manfully
i
want
it
to
help
take
care
of
mother
and
the
girls
you
a
brave
little
fellow
said
diggs
patting
him
on
the
head
so
then
we
go
at
it
at
once
stop
cried
charlie
let
mother
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
so
and
es
you
hold
the
good
hand
now
then
i
all
right
fire
away
and
clenching
his
lips
hard
he
waited
for
the
doctor
to
commence
the
operation
of
setting
his
arm
charlie
mother
tried
to
look
as
stoical
as
possible
but
the
corners
of
her
mouth
would
twitch
and
there
was
a
nervous
trembling
of
her
but
she
commanded
herself
and
only
when
charlie
gave
a
slight
groan
of
pain
stooped
and
kissed
his
forehead
and
when
she
raised
her
head
again
there
was
a
tear
resting
on
the
face
of
her
son
that
was
not
his
own
esther
was
the
picture
of
despair
and
she
wept
bitterly
for
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
her
pet
brother
and
when
the
operation
was
over
refused
to
answer
poor
caddy
questions
respecting
injuries
and
scolded
her
with
a
warmth
and
volubility
that
was
quite
surprising
to
them
all
you
must
not
be
too
hard
on
caddy
remarked
ellis
she
feels
bad
enough
i
warrant
you
it
is
a
lesson
that
will
not
i
trust
be
thrown
away
upon
her
it
will
teach
her
to
command
her
temper
in
future
caddy
was
in
truth
quite
crushed
by
the
misfortune
she
had
occasioned
and
fell
into
such
a
state
of
depression
and
apathy
as
to
be
scarcely
heard
about
the
house
indeed
so
subdued
was
she
that
kinch
went
in
and
out
without
wiping
his
feet
and
tracked
the
mud
all
over
the
and
yet
she
uttered
no
word
of
remonstrance
poor
little
charlie
suffered
much
and
was
in
a
high
fever
the
knocker
was
tied
up
the
windows
darkened
and
all
walked
about
the
house
with
sad
and
anxious
countenances
day
after
day
the
fever
increased
until
he
grew
delirious
and
raved
in
the
most
distressing
manner
the
unfortunate
haricot
was
still
on
his
mind
and
he
was
persecuted
by
men
with
heads
and
carrot
eyes
sometimes
he
imagined
himself
pursued
by
caddy
and
would
cry
in
the
most
piteous
manner
to
have
her
prevented
from
beating
him
then
his
mind
strayed
off
to
the
where
he
would
play
imaginary
games
and
laugh
over
his
success
in
such
a
wild
and
frightful
manner
as
to
draw
tears
from
the
eyes
of
all
around
him
he
was
greatly
changed
the
bright
colour
had
fled
from
his
cheek
his
head
had
been
shaved
and
he
was
thin
and
wan
and
at
times
they
were
obliged
to
watch
him
and
restrain
him
from
tossing
about
to
the
great
peril
of
his
broken
arm
at
last
his
situation
became
so
critical
that
burdett
began
to
entertain
but
slight
hopes
of
his
recovery
and
one
morning
in
the
presence
of
caddy
hinted
as
much
to
ellis
oh
doctor
doctor
exclaimed
the
distracted
girl
do
say
that
oh
try
and
save
him
how
could
i
live
with
the
thought
that
i
had
killed
my
brother
oh
i
ca
live
a
day
if
he
dies
will
god
ever
forgive
me
oh
what
a
wretch
i
have
been
oh
do
think
of
something
that
will
help
him
he
die
you
save
him
and
crying
passionately
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
in
an
agony
of
grief
they
did
their
best
to
pacify
her
but
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
until
ellis
suggested
that
since
she
could
not
control
her
feelings
she
must
be
sent
to
stay
with
her
aunt
as
her
lamentations
and
outcries
agitated
her
suffering
brother
and
made
his
condition
worse
the
idea
of
being
excluded
from
the
family
circle
at
such
a
moment
had
more
effect
on
caddy
than
all
previous
remonstrances
she
implored
to
have
the
sentence
suspended
for
a
time
at
least
that
she
might
try
to
exert
more
and
ellis
who
really
pitied
her
well
knowing
that
her
heart
was
not
in
fault
however
reprehensible
she
was
in
point
of
temper
consented
and
caddy
behaviour
from
that
moment
proved
the
sincerity
of
her
promises
and
though
she
could
not
quite
restrain
occasional
outbursts
of
senseless
lamentation
still
when
she
felt
such
fits
of
despair
coming
on
she
wisely
retired
to
some
remote
corner
of
the
house
and
did
not
till
she
had
regained
her
composure
the
crisis
was
at
length
over
and
charlie
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
no
one
was
more
elated
by
this
announcement
than
our
friend
kinch
who
had
in
fact
grown
quite
ashy
in
his
complexion
from
confinement
and
grief
and
was
now
thrown
by
this
intelligence
into
the
highest
possible
spirits
charlie
although
faint
and
weak
was
able
to
recognize
his
friends
and
derived
great
satisfaction
from
the
various
devices
of
kinch
to
entertain
him
that
young
gentleman
quite
distinguished
himself
by
the
variety
and
extent
of
his
resources
he
devised
butting
matches
between
himself
and
a
large
gourd
which
he
suspended
from
the
ceiling
and
almost
blinded
himself
by
his
attempts
to
butt
it
sufficiently
hard
to
cause
it
to
rebound
to
the
utmost
length
of
the
string
and
might
have
made
an
idiot
of
himself
for
ever
by
his
exertions
but
for
the
timely
interference
of
ellis
who
put
a
final
stop
to
this
diversion
then
he
dressed
himself
in
a
short
gown
and
nightcap
and
made
the
pillow
into
a
baby
and
played
the
nurse
with
it
to
such
perfection
that
charlie
felt
obliged
to
applaud
by
knocking
with
the
knuckles
of
his
best
hand
upon
the
of
his
bedstead
on
the
whole
he
was
so
overjoyed
as
to
be
led
to
commit
all
manner
of
eccentricities
and
conducted
himself
generally
in
such
a
ridiculous
manner
that
charlie
laughed
himself
into
a
state
of
prostration
and
kinch
was
in
consequence
banished
from
the
to
be
only
on
giving
his
promise
to
abstain
from
being
as
as
he
any
more
after
the
lapse
of
a
short
time
charlie
was
permitted
to
sit
up
and
held
regular
of
his
schoolmates
and
little
friends
he
declared
it
was
quite
a
luxury
to
have
a
broken
arm
as
it
was
a
source
of
so
much
amusement
the
old
ladies
brought
him
jellies
and
and
he
was
petted
and
caressed
to
such
an
unparalleled
extent
as
to
cause
his
delighted
mother
to
aver
that
she
lived
in
great
fear
of
his
being
spoiled
beyond
remedy
at
length
he
was
permitted
to
come
downstairs
and
sit
by
the
window
for
a
few
hours
each
day
whilst
thus
amusing
himself
one
morning
a
handsome
carriage
stopped
before
their
house
and
from
it
descended
a
fat
and
old
lady
who
knocked
at
the
door
and
rattled
the
latch
as
if
she
had
been
in
the
daily
habit
of
visiting
there
and
felt
quite
sure
of
a
hearty
welcome
she
was
let
in
by
esther
and
on
sitting
down
asked
if
ellis
was
at
home
whilst
esther
was
gone
to
summon
her
mother
the
lady
looked
round
the
room
and
espying
charlie
said
oh
there
you
are
i
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
you
are
improving
yes
politely
replied
charlie
wondering
all
the
time
who
their
visitor
could
be
you
do
seem
to
remember
me
you
ought
to
do
so
children
seldom
forget
any
one
who
makes
them
a
pleasant
promise
as
she
spoke
a
glimmer
of
recollection
shot
across
charlie
mind
and
he
exclaimed
you
are
the
lady
who
came
to
visit
the
school
yes
and
i
promised
you
a
book
for
your
aptness
and
continued
she
taking
from
her
reticule
a
copy
of
robinson
crusoe
here
it
is
ellis
as
soon
as
she
was
informed
that
a
stranger
lady
was
below
left
caddy
to
superintend
alone
the
whitewashing
of
charlie
and
having
hastily
donned
another
gown
and
a
more
tasty
cap
descended
to
see
who
the
visitor
could
be
you
must
excuse
my
not
rising
said
bird
for
that
was
the
name
it
is
rather
a
difficulty
for
me
to
get
up
and
down
often
so
continued
she
with
a
smile
you
must
excuse
my
seeming
rudeness
ellis
answered
that
any
apology
was
entirely
unnecessary
and
begged
she
would
keep
her
seat
i
come
said
bird
to
pay
your
little
man
a
visit
i
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
manner
in
which
he
recited
his
exercises
on
the
day
of
examination
that
i
promised
him
a
book
and
on
going
to
the
school
to
present
it
i
heard
of
his
unfortunate
accident
he
looks
very
much
changed
he
has
had
a
very
severe
time
i
presume
yes
a
very
severe
one
we
had
almost
given
him
over
but
it
pleased
god
to
restore
him
replied
ellis
in
a
thankful
tone
he
is
very
weak
yet
she
continued
and
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
he
is
entirely
recovered
who
is
your
physician
asked
bird
doctor
burdett
was
the
reply
he
has
been
our
physician
for
years
and
is
a
very
kind
friend
of
our
family
and
of
mine
too
rejoined
bird
he
visits
my
house
every
summer
what
does
he
think
of
the
arm
she
asked
he
thinks
in
time
it
will
be
as
strong
as
ever
and
recommends
sending
charlie
into
the
country
for
the
summer
but
said
ellis
we
are
quite
at
a
loss
where
to
send
him
oh
let
me
take
him
said
bird
i
should
be
delighted
to
have
him
i
got
a
beautiful
place
he
can
have
a
horse
to
ride
and
there
are
wide
fields
to
scamper
over
only
let
me
have
him
and
i
guarantee
to
restore
him
to
health
in
a
short
time
you
very
kind
replied
ellis
i
afraid
he
would
only
be
a
burthen
to
you
be
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
be
able
to
do
but
little
work
work
why
dear
woman
replied
bird
with
some
astonishment
i
do
want
him
to
work
i
plenty
of
servants
i
only
want
him
to
enjoy
himself
and
gather
as
much
strength
as
possible
come
make
up
your
mind
to
let
him
go
with
me
and
i
send
him
home
as
stout
as
i
am
at
the
bare
idea
of
charlie
being
brought
to
such
a
state
of
obesity
kinch
who
during
the
interview
had
been
in
the
back
part
of
the
room
making
all
manner
of
faces
was
obliged
to
leave
the
apartment
to
prevent
a
serious
explosion
of
laughter
and
after
their
visitor
had
departed
he
was
found
rolling
about
the
floor
in
a
tempest
of
mirth
after
considerable
conversation
relative
to
the
project
bird
took
her
leave
promising
to
call
soon
again
and
advising
ellis
to
accept
her
offer
ellis
consulted
burdett
who
pronounced
it
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
and
said
the
boy
could
not
be
in
better
hands
and
as
charlie
appeared
nothing
loth
it
was
decided
he
should
go
to
warmouth
to
the
great
grief
of
kinch
who
thought
it
a
most
proceeding
and
he
regarded
bird
thenceforth
as
his
personal
enemy
and
a
wilful
disturber
of
his
peace
chapter
ix
breaking
up
the
time
for
the
departure
of
the
garies
having
been
fixed
all
in
the
house
were
soon
engaged
in
the
bustle
of
preparation
boxes
were
packed
with
books
pictures
and
linen
plate
and
china
were
wrapped
and
swaddled
to
prevent
breakage
and
bruises
carpets
were
taken
up
and
packed
away
curtains
taken
down
and
covered
only
a
small
part
of
the
house
was
left
in
a
furnished
state
for
the
use
of
the
overseer
who
was
a
young
bachelor
and
did
not
require
much
space
in
superintending
all
these
arrangements
garie
displayed
great
activity
her
former
cheerfulness
of
manner
had
entirely
returned
and
garie
often
listened
with
delight
to
the
quick
pattering
of
her
feet
as
she
tripped
lightly
through
the
hall
and
up
and
down
the
long
stairs
the
birds
that
sang
about
the
windows
were
not
more
cheerful
than
herself
and
when
garie
heard
her
merry
voice
singing
her
lively
songs
as
in
days
gone
by
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
at
the
pleasant
result
of
his
acquiescence
in
her
wishes
he
had
consented
to
it
as
an
act
of
justice
due
to
her
and
the
children
there
was
no
pleasure
to
himself
growing
out
of
the
intended
change
beyond
that
of
gratifying
emily
and
securing
freedom
to
her
and
the
children
he
knew
enough
of
the
north
to
feel
convinced
that
he
could
not
expect
to
live
there
openly
with
emily
without
being
exposed
to
comments
and
closing
upon
himself
the
doors
of
many
friends
who
had
formerly
received
him
with
open
arms
the
virtuous
dignity
of
the
northerner
would
be
shocked
not
so
much
at
his
having
children
by
a
woman
of
colour
but
by
his
living
with
her
in
the
midst
of
them
and
acknowledging
her
as
his
wife
in
the
community
where
he
now
resided
such
things
were
more
common
the
only
point
in
which
he
differed
from
many
other
southern
gentlemen
in
this
matter
was
in
his
constancy
to
emily
and
the
children
and
the
more
than
ordinary
kindness
and
affection
with
which
he
treated
them
garie
had
for
many
years
led
a
very
retired
life
receiving
an
occasional
gentleman
visitor
but
this
retirement
had
been
entirely
voluntary
therefore
by
no
means
disagreeable
but
in
the
new
home
he
had
accepted
he
felt
that
he
might
be
shunned
and
the
reflection
was
anything
but
agreeable
moreover
he
was
about
to
leave
a
place
endeared
to
him
by
a
thousand
associations
here
he
had
passed
the
whole
of
his
life
except
about
four
years
spent
in
travelling
through
europe
and
america
garie
was
seated
in
a
room
where
there
were
many
things
to
recall
days
long
since
departed
the
desk
at
which
he
was
writing
was
once
his
father
and
he
well
remembered
the
methodical
manner
in
which
every
drawer
was
carefully
kept
over
it
hung
a
portrait
of
his
mother
and
it
seemed
as
he
gazed
at
it
that
it
was
only
yesterday
that
she
had
taken
his
little
hand
in
her
own
and
walked
with
him
down
the
long
avenue
of
magnolias
that
were
waving
their
branches
in
the
morning
breeze
and
loading
it
with
fragrance
near
him
was
the
table
on
which
her
used
to
stand
he
remembered
how
important
he
felt
when
permitted
to
hold
the
skeins
of
silk
for
her
to
wind
and
how
he
would
watch
her
stitch
stitch
hour
after
hour
at
the
screen
that
now
stood
beside
the
the
colours
were
faded
but
the
recollection
of
the
pleasant
smiles
she
would
cast
upon
him
from
time
to
time
as
she
looked
up
from
her
work
was
as
fresh
in
his
memory
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
garie
was
assorting
and
arranging
the
papers
that
the
desk
contained
when
he
heard
the
rattle
of
wheels
along
the
avenue
and
looking
out
of
the
window
he
saw
a
carriage
approaching
the
coachman
was
guiding
his
horses
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
he
was
endeavouring
to
keep
a
large
trunk
from
falling
from
the
top
this
was
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
as
the
horses
appeared
quite
restive
and
fully
required
his
undivided
attention
the
rather
unsteady
motion
of
the
carriage
caused
its
inmate
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
garie
recognized
his
uncle
john
who
lived
in
the
part
of
the
state
on
the
borders
of
alabama
he
immediately
left
his
desk
and
hastened
to
the
door
to
receive
him
this
is
an
unexpected
visit
but
none
the
less
pleasant
on
that
account
said
garie
his
face
lighting
up
with
surprise
and
pleasure
as
uncle
john
alighted
i
had
not
the
least
expectation
of
being
honoured
by
a
visit
from
you
what
has
brought
you
into
this
part
of
the
country
business
of
course
i
ca
conceive
it
possible
that
you
should
have
ventured
so
far
from
home
at
this
early
season
for
the
mere
purpose
of
paying
me
a
visit
you
may
take
all
the
honour
to
yourself
this
time
smilingly
replied
uncle
john
for
i
have
come
over
for
your
especial
benefit
and
if
i
accomplish
the
object
of
my
journey
i
shall
consider
the
time
anything
but
thrown
away
let
me
take
your
coat
and
eph
see
you
to
that
trunk
said
garie
you
see
everything
is
with
us
uncle
john
we
look
like
moving
do
we
like
that
or
an
annual
he
replied
as
he
picked
his
way
through
rolls
of
carpet
and
matting
and
between
boxes
in
doing
which
he
had
several
narrow
escapes
from
the
nails
that
protruded
from
them
on
all
sides
it
getting
very
warm
let
me
have
something
to
drink
said
he
wiping
his
face
as
he
took
his
seat
a
julep
plenty
of
brandy
and
ice
and
but
little
mint
eph
on
receiving
this
order
departed
in
great
haste
in
search
of
garie
as
he
knew
that
whilst
concocting
one
julep
she
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
mix
another
and
eph
had
himself
a
warm
liking
for
that
peculiar
southern
mixture
which
liking
he
never
lost
any
opportunity
to
gratify
emily
hurried
downstairs
on
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
uncle
john
for
he
was
regarded
by
her
as
a
friend
she
had
always
received
from
him
marked
kindness
and
respect
and
upon
the
arrival
of
garie
visitors
there
was
none
she
received
with
as
much
pleasure
quickly
mixing
the
drink
she
carried
it
into
the
room
where
he
and
her
husband
were
sitting
she
was
warmly
greeted
by
the
old
man
who
in
reply
to
her
question
if
he
had
come
to
make
them
a
farewell
visit
said
he
hoped
not
he
trusted
to
make
them
many
more
in
the
same
place
i
afraid
you
wo
have
an
opportunity
she
replied
in
less
than
a
week
we
expect
to
be
on
our
way
to
new
i
must
go
continued
she
and
have
a
room
prepared
for
you
and
hunt
up
the
children
scarcely
know
them
they
have
grown
so
much
since
you
were
here
i
soon
send
them
and
she
hurried
off
to
make
uncle
john
room
comfortable
i
was
never
more
surprised
in
my
life
said
the
old
gentleman
depositing
the
glass
upon
the
table
after
draining
it
of
its
contents
never
more
surprised
than
when
i
received
your
letter
in
which
you
stated
your
intention
of
going
to
the
north
to
live
a
more
ridiculous
whim
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
the
idea
is
perfectly
absurd
to
leave
a
fine
old
place
like
this
where
you
have
everything
around
you
so
nice
and
comfortable
to
go
north
and
settle
amongst
a
parcel
of
strange
yankees
my
dear
boy
you
must
give
it
up
i
no
longer
your
guardian
the
law
do
provide
one
for
people
of
thirty
years
and
upwards
so
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
say
you
shall
not
do
it
but
i
am
here
to
use
all
my
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
you
to
relinquish
the
project
uncle
john
you
do
seem
to
understand
the
matter
it
is
not
a
whim
by
any
means
it
is
a
determination
arising
from
a
strict
sense
of
duty
i
feel
that
it
is
an
act
of
justice
to
emily
and
the
children
i
pretend
to
be
better
than
most
men
but
my
conscience
will
not
permit
me
to
be
the
owner
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
going
north
because
i
wish
to
emancipate
and
educate
my
children
you
know
i
ca
do
it
here
at
first
i
was
as
disinclined
to
favour
the
project
as
you
are
but
i
am
now
convinced
it
is
my
duty
and
i
must
add
that
my
inclination
runs
in
the
same
direction
look
here
clarence
my
boy
here
interrupted
uncle
john
you
expect
to
live
there
as
you
do
here
the
prejudice
against
persons
of
colour
is
much
stronger
in
some
of
the
northern
cities
than
it
is
amongst
us
southerners
you
ca
live
with
emily
there
as
you
do
here
you
will
be
in
everybody
mouth
you
wo
be
able
to
sustain
your
old
connections
with
your
northern
friends
you
find
that
they
will
cut
you
dead
i
looked
at
it
well
uncle
john
i
counted
the
cost
and
have
made
up
my
mind
to
meet
with
many
disagreeable
things
if
my
old
friends
choose
to
turn
their
backs
on
me
because
my
wife
happens
to
belong
to
an
oppressed
race
that
is
not
my
fault
i
do
feel
that
i
have
committed
any
sin
by
making
the
choice
i
have
and
so
their
conduct
or
opinions
wo
influence
my
happiness
much
listen
to
me
clary
for
a
moment
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
as
long
as
you
live
here
in
georgia
you
can
sustain
your
present
connection
with
impunity
and
if
you
should
ever
want
to
break
it
off
you
could
do
so
by
sending
her
and
the
children
away
it
would
be
no
more
than
other
men
have
done
and
are
doing
every
day
but
go
to
the
north
and
it
becomes
a
different
thing
your
connection
with
emily
will
inevitably
become
a
matter
of
notoriety
and
then
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
shake
her
off
there
as
you
could
here
in
case
you
wanted
to
marry
another
woman
oh
uncle
uncle
how
can
you
speak
so
indifferently
about
my
doing
such
an
ungenerous
act
to
characterize
it
in
the
very
mildest
terms
i
feel
that
emily
is
as
much
my
wife
in
the
eyes
of
god
as
if
a
thousand
clergymen
had
united
us
it
is
not
my
fault
that
we
are
not
legally
married
it
is
the
fault
of
the
laws
my
father
did
not
feel
that
my
mother
was
any
more
his
wife
than
i
do
that
emily
is
mine
hush
hush
that
is
all
nonsense
boy
and
besides
it
is
paying
a
very
poor
compliment
to
your
mother
to
rank
her
with
your
mulatto
mistress
i
like
emily
very
much
she
has
been
kind
affectionate
and
faithful
to
you
yet
i
really
ca
see
the
propriety
of
your
making
a
shipwreck
of
your
whole
life
on
her
account
now
continued
uncle
john
with
great
earnestness
i
hoped
for
better
things
from
you
you
have
talents
and
wealth
you
belong
to
one
of
the
oldest
and
best
families
in
the
state
when
i
am
gone
you
will
be
the
last
of
our
name
i
had
hoped
that
you
would
have
done
something
to
keep
it
from
sinking
into
obscurity
there
is
no
honour
in
the
state
to
which
you
might
not
have
aspired
with
a
fair
chance
of
success
but
if
you
carry
out
your
absurd
determination
you
will
ruin
yourself
effectually
well
i
shall
be
ruined
then
for
i
am
determined
to
go
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
carry
out
my
design
said
garie
well
well
clary
rejoined
his
uncle
i
done
my
duty
to
my
son
i
own
that
although
i
can
not
agree
with
you
in
your
project
i
can
and
do
honour
the
unselfish
motive
that
prompts
it
you
will
always
find
me
your
friend
under
all
circumstances
and
now
concluded
he
it
off
my
mind
the
children
were
brought
in
and
duly
admired
a
box
of
miniature
carpenter
tools
was
produced
also
a
wonderful
man
with
a
string
through
his
waist
which
string
when
pulled
caused
him
to
throw
his
arms
and
legs
about
in
a
most
astonishing
manner
the
little
folks
were
highly
delighted
with
these
presents
which
uncle
john
had
purchased
at
augusta
they
scampered
off
and
soon
had
every
small
specimen
of
sable
humanity
on
the
place
at
their
heels
in
ecstatic
admiration
of
the
wonderful
articles
of
which
they
had
so
recently
acquired
possession
as
uncle
john
had
absolutely
refused
all
other
refreshment
than
the
julep
before
mentioned
dinner
was
ordered
at
a
much
earlier
hour
than
usual
he
ate
very
heartily
as
was
his
custom
and
moreover
persisted
in
stuffing
the
children
as
old
gentlemen
will
do
sometimes
until
their
mother
was
compelled
to
interfere
to
prevent
their
having
a
bilious
attack
in
consequence
whilst
the
gentlemen
were
sitting
over
their
desert
garie
asked
his
uncle
if
he
had
not
a
sister
with
whom
there
was
some
mystery
connected
no
mystery
replied
uncle
john
your
aunt
made
a
very
low
marriage
and
father
cut
her
off
from
the
family
entirely
it
happened
when
i
was
very
young
she
was
the
eldest
of
us
all
there
were
four
of
us
as
you
know
your
father
bernard
i
and
this
sister
of
whom
we
are
speaking
she
has
been
dead
for
some
years
she
married
a
carpenter
whom
father
employed
on
the
place
a
poor
white
man
from
new
york
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
was
handsome
but
drunken
and
vicious
they
left
one
child
a
boy
i
believe
he
is
alive
in
the
north
somewhere
or
was
a
few
years
since
and
did
she
never
make
any
overtures
for
a
reconciliation
she
did
some
years
before
father
death
but
he
was
inexorable
he
returned
her
letter
and
died
without
seeing
or
forgiving
her
replied
uncle
john
poor
thing
i
suppose
they
were
very
poor
i
suppose
they
were
i
have
no
sympathy
for
her
she
deserved
her
fate
for
marrying
a
greasy
mechanic
in
opposition
to
her
father
commands
when
she
might
have
connected
herself
with
any
of
the
highest
families
in
the
state
the
gentlemen
remained
a
long
while
that
night
sipping
their
wine
smoking
cigars
and
discussing
the
probable
result
of
the
contemplated
change
uncle
john
seemed
to
have
the
worst
forebodings
as
to
the
ultimate
consequences
and
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion
that
they
would
all
return
to
the
old
place
in
less
than
a
year
you
soon
get
tired
of
it
said
he
everything
is
so
different
there
here
you
can
get
on
well
in
your
present
relations
but
mark
me
find
nothing
but
disappointment
and
trouble
where
you
are
going
the
next
morning
he
departed
for
his
home
he
kissed
the
children
affectionately
and
shook
hands
warmly
with
their
mother
after
getting
into
the
carriage
he
held
out
his
hand
again
to
his
nephew
saying
i
am
afraid
you
are
going
to
be
disappointed
but
i
hope
you
may
not
good
bye
good
bye
god
bless
you
and
his
blue
eyes
looked
very
watery
as
he
was
driven
from
the
door
that
day
a
letter
arrived
from
savannah
informing
them
that
the
ship
in
which
they
had
engaged
passage
would
be
ready
to
sail
in
a
few
days
and
they
therefore
determined
that
the
first
instalment
of
boxes
and
trunks
should
be
sent
to
the
city
forthwith
and
to
eph
was
assigned
the
melancholy
duty
of
superintending
their
removal
let
me
go
with
him
pa
begged
little
clarence
who

his
father

said
eph
who
hastened
off
to
prepare
the
horses
followed
by
the
delighted
clarence
that
evening
after
his
return
from
savannah
clarence
kept
his
little
sister
eyes
expanded
to
an
unprecedented
extent
by
his
narration
of
the
wonderful
occurrences
attendant
on
his
trip
to
town
and
also
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
vessel
he
produced
an
immense
orange
also
a
vast
store
of
almonds
and
raisins
which
had
been
given
him
by
the
steward
but
em
said
he
we
are
going
to
sleep
in
such
funny
little
places
even
pa
and
mamma
have
got
to
sleep
on
little
shelves
stuck
up
against
the
wall
and
they
got
a
thing
that
swings
from
the
ceiling
that
they
keep
the
tumblers
and
in
every
glass
has
got
a
little
hole
for
itself
oh
it
so
nice
and
have
they
got
any
nice
shady
trees
on
the
ship
asked
the
wondering
little
em
oh
no
what
nonsense
answered
clarence
swelling
with
the
importance
conferred
by
his
superior
knowledge
why
no
em
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
trees
on
a
ship
they
could
have
trees
on
a
ship
if
they
wanted
there
no
earth
for
them
to
grow
in
but
i
tell
you
what
they
got
they
got
masts
a
great
deal
higher
than
any
tree
and
going
to
climb
clear
up
to
the
top
when
we
go
to
live
on
the
ship
i
would
said
em
you
might
fall
down
like
ben
did
from
the
tree
and
then
you
have
to
have
your
head
sewed
up
as
he
had
the
probability
that
an
occurrence
of
this
nature
might
be
the
result
of
his
attempt
to
climb
the
mast
seemed
to
have
considerable
weight
with
master
clarence
so
he
relieved
his
sister
mind
at
once
by
relinquishing
the
project
the
morning
for
departure
at
length
arrived
eph
brought
the
carriage
to
the
door
at
an
early
hour
and
sat
upon
the
box
the
picture
of
despair
he
did
not
descend
from
his
eminence
to
assist
in
any
of
the
little
arrangements
for
the
journey
being
very
fearful
that
the
seat
he
occupied
might
be
resumed
by
its
rightful
owner
he
having
had
a
lengthy
contest
with
the
sable
official
who
acted
as
coachman
and
who
had
striven
manfully
on
this
occasion
to
take
possession
of
his
usual
elevated
station
on
the
family
equipage
this
eph
would
by
no
means
permit
as
he
declared
he
was
gwine
to
let
nobody
drive
massa
dat
day
but
hissef
it
was
a
mournful
parting
the
slaves
crowded
around
the
carriage
kissing
and
embracing
the
children
and
forcing
upon
them
little
tokens
of
remembrance
blind
jacob
the
patriarch
of
the
place
came
and
passed
his
hands
over
the
face
of
little
em
for
the
last
time
as
he
had
done
almost
every
week
since
her
birth
that
to
use
his
own
language
he
might
see
how
de
piccaninny
growed
his
bleared
and
sightless
eyes
were
turned
to
heaven
to
ask
a
blessing
on
the
little
ones
and
their
parents
why
daddy
jake
you
should
not
take
it
so
hard
said
garie
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
you
see
us
all
again
some
day
no
no
massa
feared
i
wo
gettin
mighty
old
massa
and
gwine
home
soon
i
hopes
i
meet
you
all
up
yonder
said
he
pointing
heavenward
i
do
to
see
any
of
you
here
agin
many
of
the
slaves
were
in
tears
and
all
deeply
lamented
the
departure
of
their
master
and
his
family
for
garie
had
always
been
the
kindest
of
owners
and
garie
was
if
possible
more
beloved
than
himself
she
was
first
at
every
and
had
been
to
all
the
afflicted
and
distressed
in
the
place
at
last
the
carriage
rolled
away
and
in
a
few
hours
they
reached
savannah
and
immediately
went
on
board
the
vessel
chapter
x
another
parting
ellis
had
been
for
some
time
engaged
in
arranging
and
replenishing
charlie
wardrobe
preparatory
to
his
journey
to
warmouth
with
bird
an
entire
new
suit
of
grey
cloth
had
been
ordered
of
the
tailor
to
whom
ellis
gave
strict
injunctions
not
to
make
them
too
small
notwithstanding
the
unfavourable
results
of
several
experiments
ellis
adhered
with
wonderful
tenacity
to
the
idea
that
a
boy
clothes
could
never
be
made
too
large
and
therefore
when
charlie
had
a
new
suit
it
always
appeared
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
some
portly
gentleman
and
sent
home
to
charlie
by
mistake
this
last
suit
formed
no
exception
to
the
others
and
charlie
surveyed
with
dismay
its
ample
dimensions
as
it
hung
from
the
back
of
the
chair
oh
gemini
said
he
but
that
jacket
is
a
rouser
i
tell
you
what
mother
you
have
to
get
out
a
to
find
me
in
that
jacket
now
mind
i
tell
you
nonsense
replied
ellis
it
do
look
a
bit
too
large
put
it
on
charlie
took
up
the
coat
and
in
a
twinkling
had
it
on
over
his
other
his
hands
were
almost
completely
lost
in
the
excessively
long
sleeves
which
hung
down
so
far
that
the
tips
of
his
fingers
were
barely
visible
oh
mother
he
exclaimed
just
look
at
these
sleeves
if
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
that
any
one
were
to
offer
me
a
half
dollar
they
would
change
their
mind
before
i
could
get
my
hand
out
to
take
it
and
it
will
almost
go
twice
round
me
it
is
so
large
in
the
waist
oh
you
can
turn
the
sleeves
up
and
as
for
the
waist
you
soon
grow
to
it
it
will
be
tight
enough
for
you
before
long
i
warrant
said
ellis
but
mother
rejoined
charlie
that
is
just
what
you
said
about
the
other
blue
suit
and
it
was
entirely
worn
out
before
you
had
let
down
the
tucks
in
the
trowsers
never
mind
the
blue
suit
persisted
ellis
entirely
unbiassed
by
this
statement
of
facts
you
grow
faster
this
time
you
going
into
the
country
you
must
remember
boys
always
grow
fast
in
the
country
go
into
the
other
room
and
try
on
the
trowsers
charlie
retired
into
another
room
with
the
trowsers
in
question
here
he
was
joined
by
kinch
who
went
into
fits
of
laughter
over
as
he
offensively
called
the
new
coat
why
charlie
said
he
it
fits
you
like
a
shirt
on
a
or
rather
it
like
a
sentry
box
it
do
touch
you
any
where
but
get
into
these
pants
said
he
almost
choking
with
the
laughter
that
vexed
look
caused
him
to
suppress
get
into
the
pants
at
the
same
time
tying
a
string
round
charlie
neck
what
are
you
doing
that
for
exclaimed
charlie
in
an
irritated
tone
i
should
have
thought
you
would
make
fun
of
me
oh
said
kinch
assuming
a
solemn
look
do
they
always
tie
a
rope
round
a
man
body
when
they
are
going
to
lower
him
into
a
pit
and
how
on
earth
do
you
ever
expect
we
shall
find
you
in
the
legs
of
them
trowsers
unless
something
is
fastened
to
you
here
charlie
was
obliged
to
join
in
the
laugh
that
kinch
could
no
longer
restrain
stop
that
playing
boys
cried
ellis
as
their
noisy
mirth
reached
her
in
the
adjoining
room
you
forget
i
am
waiting
for
you
charlie
hastily
drew
on
the
trousers
and
found
that
their
dimensions
fully
justified
the
precaution
kinch
was
desirous
of
taking
to
secure
him
from
sinking
into
oblivion
oh
i
ca
wear
these
things
said
charlie
tears
of
vexation
starting
from
his
eyes
why
they
are
so
large
i
ca
even
keep
them
up
and
just
look
at
the
legs
will
you
they
have
to
be
turned
up
a
quarter
of
a
yard
at
least
here
said
kinch
seizing
a
large
pillow
i
stuff
this
in
oh
golly
how
you
look
if
you
ai
a
sight
to
see
and
he
shouted
with
laughter
as
he
surveyed
charlie
to
whom
the
pillow
had
imparted
the
appearance
of
a
london
alderman
if
you
do
look
like
squire
baker
now
i
give
it
up
you
are
as
big
as
old
daddy
downhill
you
are
a
regular
daniel
lambert
the
idea
of
looking
like
squire
baker
and
daddy
downhill
who
were
the
fat
men
of
their
acquaintance
amused
charlie
as
much
as
it
did
his
companion
and
making
the
house
ring
with
their
mirth
they
entered
the
room
where
ellis
and
the
girls
had
joined
ellis
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
the
child
exclaimed
ellis
as
he
gazed
upon
the
grotesque
figure
charlie
presented
what
has
the
boy
been
doing
to
himself
hereupon
kinch
explained
how
matters
stood
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
all
parties
oh
ellen
said
ellis
you
must
have
them
altered
they
a
mile
too
big
for
him
i
really
believe
they
would
fit
me
they
do
look
rather
large
said
ellis
reluctantly
but
it
seems
such
a
waste
to
take
them
in
as
he
grows
so
fast
he
would
not
grow
enough
in
two
years
to
fill
that
suit
rejoined
ellis
and
he
will
have
worn
them
out
in
less
than
six
months
and
so
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
charlie
it
was
concluded
that
they
should
be
sent
back
to
the
tailor
for
the
evidently
necessary
alterations
the
day
for
charlie
departure
at
last
arrived
kinch
who
had
been
up
since
two
in
the
morning
was
found
by
caddy
at
the
early
hour
of
five
waiting
upon
the
to
accompany
his
friend
to
the
wharf
beside
him
lay
a
bag
in
which
there
appeared
to
be
some
living
object
what
have
you
got
in
here
asked
caddy
as
she
gave
the
bag
a
punch
with
the
broom
she
was
using
it
a
present
for
charlie
replied
kinch
opening
the
bag
and
displaying
to
the
astonished
gaze
of
caddy
a
very
young
pig
why
said
she
laughing
you
do
expect
he
can
take
that
with
him
do
you
why
not
asked
kinch
taking
up
the
bag
and
carrying
it
into
the
house
it
just
the
thing
to
take
into
the
country
charlie
can
fatten
him
and
sell
him
for
a
lot
of
money
it
was
as
much
as
ellis
could
do
to
convince
charlie
and
kinch
of
the
impracticability
of
their
scheme
of
carrying
off
to
warmouth
the
pig
in
question
she
suggested
as
it
was
the
exclusive
property
of
kinch
and
he
was
so
exceedingly
anxious
to
make
charlie
a
parting
gift
that
she
should
purchase
it
which
she
did
on
the
spot
and
kinch
invested
all
the
money
in
a
large
wherewith
charlie
was
to
shoot
game
sufficient
to
supply
both
kinch
and
his
own
parents
had
charlie
been
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
he
could
not
have
been
followed
by
a
more
solemn
face
than
that
presented
by
kinch
as
he
trudged
on
with
him
in
the
rear
the
porter
who
carried
the
trunk
i
wish
you
were
not
going
said
he
as
he
put
his
arm
affectionately
over
charlie
shoulder
i
shall
be
so
lonesome
when
you
are
gone
and
what
is
more
i
know
i
shall
get
licked
every
day
in
school
for
who
will
help
me
with
my
sums
oh
any
of
the
boys
will
they
all
like
you
kinch
and
if
you
only
study
a
little
harder
you
can
do
them
yourself
was
charlie
encouraging
reply
on
arriving
at
the
boat
they
found
bird
waiting
for
them
so
charlie
hastily
kissed
his
mother
and
sisters
and
made
endless
promises
not
to
be
mischievous
and
above
all
to
be
as
tidy
as
possible
then
tearing
himself
away
from
them
and
turning
to
kinch
he
exclaimed
i
be
back
to
see
you
all
again
soon
so
do
cry
old
fellow
and
at
the
same
time
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
drew
out
a
number
of
marbles
which
he
gave
him
his
own
lips
quivering
all
the
while
at
last
his
attempts
to
suppress
his
tears
and
look
like
a
man
grew
entirely
futile
and
he
cried
heartily
as
bird
took
his
hand
and
drew
him
on
board
the
steamer
as
it
slowly
moved
from
the
pier
and
glided
up
the
river
charlie
stood
looking
with
tearful
eyes
at
his
mother
and
sisters
who
with
kinch
waved
their
handkerchiefs
as
long
as
they
could
distinguish
him
and
then
he
saw
them
move
away
with
the
crowd
bird
who
had
been
conversing
with
a
lady
who
accompanied
her
a
short
distance
on
her
journey
came
and
took
her
little
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
a
seat
near
her
in
the
after
part
of
the
boat
informing
him
as
she
did
so
that
they
would
shortly
exchange
the
steamer
for
the
cars
and
she
thought
he
had
better
remain
near
her
after
some
time
they
approached
the
little
town
where
the
passengers
took
the
train
for
new
york
bird
who
had
taken
leave
of
her
friend
held
charlie
fast
by
the
hand
and
they
entered
the
cars
together
he
looked
a
little
pale
and
weak
from
the
excitement
of
parting
and
the
novelty
of
his
situation
bird
observing
his
pallid
look
placed
him
on
a
seat
and
propped
him
up
with
shawls
and
cushions
making
him
as
comfortable
as
possible
the
train
had
not
long
started
when
the
conductor
came
through
to
inspect
the
tickets
and
quite
started
with
surprise
at
seeing
charlie
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
velvet
cushion
what
are
you
doing
here
exclaimed
he
at
the
same
time
shaking
him
roughly
to
arouse
him
from
the
slight
slumber
into
which
he
had
fallen
come
get
up
you
must
go
out
of
this
what
do
you
mean
by
such
conduct
asked
bird
very
much
surprised
do
wake
him
i
got
his
ticket
the
child
is
sick
i
do
care
whether
he
sick
or
well
he
ca
ride
in
here
we
allow
niggers
to
ride
in
this
car
no
how
you
can
fix
it
so
come
youngster
said
he
gruffly
to
the
now
aroused
boy
you
must
travel
out
of
this
he
shall
do
no
such
thing
replied
bird
in
a
decided
tone
paid
fall
price
for
his
ticket
and
he
shall
ride
here
you
have
no
legal
right
to
eject
him
i
got
no
time
to
jaw
about
rights
legal
or
illegal
all
i
care
to
know
is
that
i
my
orders
not
to
let
niggers
ride
in
these
cars
and
i
expect
to
obey
so
you
see
there
is
no
use
to
make
any
fuss
about
it
charlie
said
bird
sit
here
and
she
moved
aside
so
as
to
seat
him
between
herself
and
the
window
now
said
she
move
him
if
you
think
best
i
tell
you
what
it
is
old
woman
doggedly
remarked
the
conductor
you
ca
play
that
game
with
me
i
made
up
my
mind
that
no
more
niggers
shall
ride
in
this
car
and
i
have
him
out
of
here
cost
what
it
may
the
passengers
now
began
to
cluster
around
the
contending
parties
and
to
take
sides
in
the
controversy
in
the
end
the
conductor
stopped
the
train
and
called
in
one
or
two
of
the
irish
to
assist
him
if
necessary
in
enforcing
his
orders
you
had
better
let
the
boy
go
into
the
negro
car
madam
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
respectfully
it
is
perfectly
useless
to
contend
with
these
ruffians
i
saw
a
coloured
man
ejected
from
here
last
week
and
severely
injured
and
in
the
present
state
of
public
feeling
if
anything
happened
to
you
or
the
child
you
would
be
entirely
without
redress
the
directors
of
this
railroad
control
the
state
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
justice
to
be
obtained
in
any
of
the
state
courts
in
a
matter
in
which
they
are
concerned
if
you
will
accept
of
my
arm
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
other
car
if
you
will
not
permit
the
child
to
go
there
alone
you
had
better
go
quietly
with
him
oh
what
is
the
use
of
so
much
talk
about
it
why
do
you
hustle
the
old
thing
out
remarked
a
bystander
the
respectability
of
whose
appearance
contrasted
broadly
with
his
manners
she
is
some
abolitionist
making
so
much
fuss
about
a
little
nigger
let
her
go
into
the
nigger
car
she
be
more
at
home
there
bird
seeing
the
uselessness
of
contention
accepted
the
proffered
escort
of
the
gentleman
before
mentioned
and
was
followed
out
of
the
cars
by
the
conductor
and
his
blackguard
assistants
all
of
them
highly
elated
by
the
victory
they
had
won
over
a
defenceless
old
woman
and
a
feeble
little
boy
bird
shrunk
back
as
they
opened
the
door
of
the
car
that
had
been
set
apart
for
coloured
persons
and
such
objectionable
whites
as
were
not
admitted
to
the
cars
oh
what
a
wretched
place
she
exclaimed
as
she
surveyed
the
rough
pine
timbers
and
dirty
floor
i
would
not
force
a
dog
to
ride
in
such
a
filthy
place
oh
do
stay
here
never
mind
me
i
shall
get
on
by
myself
well
enough
i
dare
say
said
charlie
it
is
too
nasty
a
place
for
you
to
stay
in
no
my
child
she
replied
i
remain
with
you
i
could
not
think
of
permitting
you
to
be
alone
in
your
present
state
of
health
i
declare
she
continued
it
enough
to
make
any
one
an
abolitionist
or
anything
else
of
the
kind
to
see
how
inoffensive
coloured
people
are
treated
that
evening
they
went
on
board
the
steamer
that
was
to
convey
them
to
warmouth
where
they
arrived
very
early
the
following
morning
charlie
was
charmed
with
the
appearance
of
the
pretty
little
town
as
they
rode
through
it
in
bird
carriage
which
awaited
them
at
the
landing
at
the
door
of
her
residence
they
were
met
by
two
maids
who
seemed
highly
delighted
at
the
arrival
of
their
mistress
now
charlie
said
bird
as
she
sat
down
in
her
large
and
looked
round
her
snug
little
parlour
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
now
we
are
at
home
and
you
must
try
and
make
yourself
as
happy
as
possible
betsey
said
she
turning
to
one
of
the
women
here
is
a
nice
little
fellow
whom
i
have
brought
with
me
to
remain
during
the
summer
of
whom
i
want
you
to
take
the
best
care
for
continued
she
looking
at
him
compassionately
the
poor
child
has
had
the
misfortune
to
break
his
arm
recently
and
he
has
not
been
strong
since
the
physician
thought
the
country
would
be
the
best
place
for
him
and
so
i
brought
him
here
to
stay
with
us
tell
reuben
to
carry
his
trunk
into
the
little
maple
chamber
and
after
i
have
rested
i
will
take
a
walk
over
the
place
with
him
here
are
two
letters
for
you
said
betsey
taking
them
from
the
mantelpiece
and
handing
them
to
her
mistress
bird
opened
one
of
which
she
read
a
part
and
then
laid
it
down
as
being
apparently
of
no
importance
the
other
however
seemed
to
have
a
great
effect
upon
her
as
she
exclaimed
hurriedly
tell
reuben
not
to
unharness
the
horses
i
must
go
to
francisville
immediately
dear
hinton
is
very
ill
and
not
expected
to
recover
you
must
take
good
care
of
charlie
until
i
return
if
i
do
not
come
back
you
will
know
that
she
is
worse
and
that
i
am
compelled
to
remain
there
and
on
the
carriage
being
brought
to
the
door
she
departed
in
haste
to
visit
her
sick
friend
chapter
xi
the
new
home
when
garie
embarked
she
entertained
the
idea
so
prevalent
among
sailors
that
she
was
to
be
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
father
neptune
in
accordance
with
which
all
who
intrude
for
the
first
time
upon
his
domain
are
compelled
to
pay
tribute
to
his
greatness
and
humbly
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
his
power
garie
had
determined
not
to
be
upon
any
account
whatever
being
fully
persuaded
she
could
brave
the
ocean
with
impunity
and
was
accordingly
very
brisk
and
as
she
walked
up
and
down
upon
the
deck
of
the
vessel
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
they
sailed
out
of
the
harbour
and
were
soon
in
the
open
sea
she
began
to
find
out
how
mistaken
she
had
been
as
unmistakable
symptoms
convinced
her
of
the
vanity
of
all
human
calculations
why
you
are
not
going
to
be
ill
em
after
all
your
valiant
declarations
exclaimed
garie
supporting
her
unsteady
steps
as
they
paced
to
and
fro
oh
no
no
said
she
in
a
firm
tone
i
do
intend
to
give
up
to
any
such
nonsense
i
believe
that
people
can
keep
up
if
they
try
i
do
feel
a
little
fatigued
and
nervous
it
caused
no
doubt
by
the
long
drive
of
this
morning
although
i
think
it
singular
that
a
drive
should
affect
me
in
this
manner
thus
speaking
she
sat
down
by
the
bulwarks
of
the
vessel
and
a
despairing
look
gradually
crept
over
her
face
at
last
she
suddenly
rose
to
look
at
the
water
as
we
may
imagine
the
effect
of
her
scrutiny
however
was
that
she
asked
feebly
to
be
assisted
to
her
where
she
remained
until
their
arrival
in
the
harbour
of
new
york
the
children
suffered
only
for
a
short
time
and
as
their
father
escaped
entirely
he
was
able
to
watch
that
they
got
into
no
mischief
they
were
both
great
favourites
with
the
captain
and
steward
and
between
the
two
were
so
stuffed
and
crammed
with
sweets
as
to
place
their
health
in
considerable
jeopardy
it
was
a
delightful
morning
when
they
sailed
into
the
harbour
of
new
york
the
waters
were
dancing
and
rippling
in
the
morning
sun
and
the
were
skimming
swiftly
across
its
surface
in
their
trips
to
and
from
the
city
which
was
just
awaking
to
its
daily
life
of
bustling
toil
what
an
immense
city
it
is
said
garie
how
full
of
life
and
bustle
why
there
are
more
ships
at
one
pier
here
than
there
are
in
the
whole
port
of
savanah
yes
dear
rejoined
her
husband
and
what
is
more
there
always
will
be
our
folks
in
georgia
are
not
waked
up
yet
and
when
they
do
arouse
themselves
from
their
slumber
it
will
be
too
late
but
we
do
see
half
the
shipping
from
here
this
is
only
one
side
of
the
city
there
is
much
more
on
the
other
look
over
there
continued
he
pointing
to
jersey
city
that
is
where
we
take
the
cars
for
philadelphia
and
if
we
get
up
to
dock
in
three
or
four
hours
we
shall
be
in
time
for
the
train
in
less
time
than
they
anticipated
they
were
alongside
the
wharf
the
trunks
were
brought
up
and
all
things
for
present
use
were
safely
packed
together
and
despatched
under
the
steward
care
to
the
office
of
the
railroad
and
garie
after
bidding
to
the
captain
followed
with
the
children
who
were
thrown
into
a
great
state
of
excitement
by
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
crowded
thoroughfare
how
this
whirl
and
confusion
distracts
me
said
garie
looking
out
of
the
i
hope
philadelphia
is
not
as
noisy
a
place
as
this
oh
no
replied
garie
it
is
one
of
the
most
quiet
and
clean
cities
in
the
world
whilst
this
is
the
noisiest
and
dirtiest
i
always
hurry
out
of
new
york
it
is
to
me
such
a
disagreeable
place
with
its
extortionate
hackmen
and
filthy
streets
on
arriving
at
the
little
steamer
in
which
they
crossed
the
ferry
they
found
it
about
to
start
and
therefore
had
to
hurry
on
board
with
all
possible
speed
under
the
circumstances
the
hackman
felt
that
it
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
if
he
did
not
extort
a
large
fare
and
he
therefore
charged
an
extravagant
price
garie
paid
him
as
he
had
no
time
to
parley
and
barely
succeeded
in
slipping
a
into
the
hand
when
the
boat
pushed
off
from
the
pier
in
a
few
moments
they
had
crossed
the
river
and
were
soon
comfortably
seated
in
the
cars
whirling
over
the
track
to
philadelphia
as
the
conductor
came
through
to
examine
the
tickets
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
garie
and
the
children
as
he
passed
on
his
assistant
inquired
is
that
a
nigger
yes
a
one
was
the
reply
why
do
you
order
her
out
then
she
has
no
business
to
ride
in
here
continued
the
first
speaker
i
guess
we
had
better
let
her
alone
suggested
the
conductor
particularly
as
no
one
has
complained
and
there
might
be
a
row
if
she
turned
out
to
be
the
nurse
to
those
children
the
whole
party
are
southerners
that
clear
and
these
southerners
are
mighty
touchy
about
their
niggers
sometimes
and
kick
and
cut
like
the
devil
about
them
i
guess
we
had
better
let
her
alone
unless
some
one
complains
about
her
being
there
as
they
drove
through
the
streets
of
philadelphia
on
the
way
to
their
new
home
garie
gave
rent
to
many
expressions
of
delight
at
the
appearance
of
the
city
oh
what
a
sweet
place
everything
is
so
bright
and
why
the
pavement
and
doorsteps
look
as
if
they
were
cleaned
twice
a
day
just
look
at
that
house
how
spotless
it
is
i
hope
ours
resembles
that
ours
is
a
new
house
is
it
not
she
inquired
not
entirely
it
has
been
occupied
before
but
only
for
a
short
time
i
believe
was
her
husband
reply
it
had
grown
quite
dark
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
where
caddy
had
been
anxiously
holding
watch
and
ward
in
company
with
the
servants
who
had
been
procured
for
them
a
bright
light
was
burning
in
the
entry
as
the
coachman
stopped
at
the
door
this
is
no
said
he
opening
the
door
of
the
carriage
shall
i
ring
yes
do
replied
garie
but
whilst
he
was
endeavouring
to
open
the
gate
of
the
little
garden
in
front
caddy
who
had
heard
the
carriage
stop
bounded
out
to
welcome
them
this
is
garie
i
suppose
said
she
as
he
alighted
yes
i
am
and
you
i
suppose
are
the
daughter
of
mr
ellis
yes
sir
i
sorry
mother
is
not
here
to
welcome
you
she
was
here
until
very
late
last
night
expecting
your
arrival
and
was
here
again
this
morning
said
caddy
taking
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
little
carpet
bags
give
me
the
little
girl
i
can
take
care
of
her
too
she
continued
and
with
little
em
on
one
arm
and
the
carpet
bag
on
the
other
she
led
the
way
into
the
house
we
did
not
make
up
any
fire
said
she
the
weather
is
very
warm
to
us
i
do
know
how
it
may
feel
to
you
though
it
is
a
little
chilly
replied
garie
as
she
sat
down
upon
the
sofa
and
looked
round
the
room
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
and
added
all
this
place
wants
to
make
it
the
most
bewitching
of
rooms
is
a
little
fire
caddy
hurried
the
new
servants
from
place
to
place
remorselessly
and
set
them
to
prepare
the
table
and
get
the
things
ready
for
tea
she
waylaid
a
party
of
labourers
who
chanced
to
be
coming
that
way
and
hired
them
to
carry
all
the
luggage
upstairs
had
the
desired
fire
made
mixed
up
some
and
had
tea
on
the
table
in
a
twinkling
they
all
ate
very
heartily
and
caddy
was
greatly
praised
for
her
activity
you
are
quite
a
housekeeper
said
garie
to
caddy
do
you
like
it
oh
yes
she
replied
i
see
to
the
house
at
home
almost
entirely
mother
and
esther
are
so
much
engaged
in
sewing
that
they
are
glad
enough
to
leave
it
in
my
hands
and
i
much
rather
do
that
than
sew
i
hope
said
garie
that
your
mother
will
permit
you
to
remain
with
us
until
we
get
entirely
settled
i
know
she
will
confidently
replied
caddy
she
will
be
up
here
in
the
morning
she
will
know
you
have
arrived
by
my
not
having
gone
home
this
evening
the
children
had
now
fallen
asleep
with
their
heads
in
close
proximity
to
their
plates
and
garie
declared
that
she
felt
very
much
fatigued
and
slightly
indisposed
and
thought
the
sooner
she
retired
the
better
it
would
be
for
her
she
accordingly
went
up
to
the
room
which
she
had
already
seen
and
greatly
admired
and
was
soon
in
the
land
of
dreams
as
is
always
the
case
on
such
occasions
the
children
could
not
be
found
clarence
was
put
to
bed
in
one
of
his
father
shirts
in
which
he
was
almost
lost
and
little
em
was
temporarily
accommodated
with
a
calico
short
gown
of
caddy
and
in
default
of
a
nightcap
had
her
head
tied
up
in
a
madras
handkerchief
which
gave
her
when
her
back
was
turned
very
much
the
air
of
an
old
creole
who
had
been
by
some
mysterious
means
deprived
of
her
due
growth
the
next
morning
garie
was
so
much
indisposed
at
to
be
unable
to
rise
and
took
her
breakfast
in
bed
her
husband
had
finished
his
meal
and
was
sitting
in
the
parlour
when
he
observed
a
coloured
lady
coming
into
the
garden
look
caddy
cried
he
is
this
your
mother
oh
yes
that
is
she
replied
caddy
and
ran
and
opened
the
door
exclaiming
oh
mother
they
come
and
as
she
spoke
garie
came
into
the
entry
and
shook
hands
heartily
with
her
i
so
much
indebted
to
you
said
he
for
arranging
everything
so
nicely
for
us
there
is
not
a
thing
we
would
wish
to
alter
i
am
very
glad
you
are
pleased
we
did
our
best
to
make
it
comfortable
was
her
reply
and
you
succeeded
beyond
our
expectation
but
do
come
up
continued
he
emily
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
she
is
quite
unwell
this
morning
has
not
even
got
up
yet
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
he
ushered
ellis
into
the
bedroom
why
can
this
be
you
said
she
surveying
emily
with
surprise
and
pleasure
if
i
had
met
you
anywhere
i
should
never
have
known
you
how
you
have
altered
you
were
not
so
tall
as
my
caddy
when
i
saw
you
last
and
here
you
are
with
two
children
and
pretty
little
things
they
are
too
said
she
kissing
little
em
who
was
seated
on
the
bed
with
her
brother
and
sharing
with
him
the
remains
of
her
mother
chocolate
and
you
look
much
younger
that
i
expected
to
see
you
replied
garie
draw
a
chair
up
to
the
bed
and
let
us
have
a
talk
about
old
times
you
must
excuse
my
lying
down
i
do
intend
to
get
up
i
feel
quite
indisposed
ellis
took
off
her
bonnet
and
prepared
for
a
long
chat
whilst
garie
looking
at
his
watch
declared
it
was
getting
late
and
started
for
down
town
where
he
had
to
transact
some
business
you
can
scarcely
think
ellen
how
much
i
feel
indebted
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
us
and
we
are
so
distressed
to
hear
about
accident
you
must
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
oh
no
none
to
speak
of
and
had
it
been
ever
so
much
i
should
have
been
just
as
pleased
to
have
done
it
i
was
so
glad
you
were
coming
what
did
put
it
in
your
heads
to
come
here
to
live
continued
ellis
oh
cousin
george
winston
praised
the
place
so
highly
and
you
know
how
disagreeable
georgia
is
to
live
in
my
mind
was
never
at
rest
there
respecting
these
said
she
pointing
to
the
children
so
that
i
fairly
teased
garie
into
it
did
you
recognize
george
no
i
did
remember
much
about
him
i
should
never
have
taken
him
for
a
coloured
man
had
i
met
him
in
the
street
i
should
have
supposed
him
to
be
a
wealthy
white
southerner
what
a
gentleman
he
is
in
his
appearance
and
manners
said
ellis
yes
he
is
all
that
my
husband
thinks
there
is
no
one
like
him
but
we
wo
talk
about
him
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
yourself
and
family
and
then
i
tell
you
everything
respecting
my
own
fortunes
hereupon
ensued
long
narratives
from
both
parties
which
occupied
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
garie
on
leaving
the
house
slowly
wended
his
way
to
the
residence
of
walters
as
he
passed
into
the
lower
part
of
the
city
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
number
of
coloured
children
he
saw
skipping
merrily
along
with
their
bags
of
books
on
their
arms
this
said
he
to
himself
do
much
resemble
georgia
footnote
it
is
a
penal
offence
in
georgia
to
teach
coloured
children
to
read
after
walking
some
distance
he
took
out
a
card
and
read
and
on
inquiry
found
himself
in
the
very
street
he
proceeded
to
inspect
the
numbers
and
was
quite
perplexed
by
their
confusion
and
irregularity
a
coloured
boy
happening
to
pass
at
the
time
he
asked
him
which
way
do
the
numbers
run
my
little
man
the
boy
looked
up
waggishly
and
replied
they
do
run
at
all
they
are
permanently
affixed
to
each
door
but
said
garie
yet
compelled
to
smile
at
the
pompous
wit
you
know
what
i
mean
i
can
not
find
the
number
i
wish
the
street
is
not
correctly
numbered
the
street
is
not
numbered
at
all
rejoined
the
boy
but
the
houses
are
and
he
skipped
lightly
away
garie
was
finally
set
right
about
the
numbers
and
found
himself
at
length
before
the
door
of
walters
house
quite
a
handsome
residence
said
he
as
he
surveyed
the
stately
house
with
its
spotless
marble
steps
and
shining
silver
on
ringing
his
summons
was
quickly
answered
by
a
servant
who
informed
him
that
walters
was
at
home
and
ushered
him
into
the
parlour
the
elegance
of
the
room
took
garie
completely
by
surprise
as
its
furniture
indicated
not
only
great
wealth
but
cultivated
taste
and
refined
habits
the
walls
were
adorned
by
paintings
from
the
hands
of
foreign
and
native
artists
rich
vases
and
bronzes
were
placed
in
the
most
favourable
situations
in
the
apartment
the
walnut
table
was
covered
with
those
charming
little
bijoux
which
the
french
only
are
capable
of
conceiving
and
which
are
only
at
the
command
of
such
purchasers
as
are
possessed
of
more
money
than
they
otherwise
can
conveniently
spend
garie
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
was
soon
so
absorbed
in
contemplating
the
likeness
of
a
negro
officer
which
hung
opposite
that
he
did
not
hear
the
soft
tread
of
walters
as
he
entered
the
room
the
latter
stepping
slowly
forward
caught
the
eye
of
garie
who
started
up
astonished
at
the
commanding
figure
before
him
garie
i
presume
said
walters
yes
he
replied
and
added
as
he
extended
his
hand
i
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
walters
i
suppose
walters
bowed
low
as
he
accepted
the
proffered
hand
and
courteously
requested
his
visitor
to
be
seated
as
garie
resumed
his
seat
he
could
not
repress
a
look
of
surprise
which
walters
apparently
perceived
for
a
smile
slightly
curled
his
lip
as
he
also
took
a
seat
opposite
his
visitor
walters
was
above
six
feet
in
height
and
exceedingly
of
complexion
and
smooth
glossy
skin
his
head
was
covered
with
a
quantity
of
woolly
hair
which
was
combed
back
from
a
broad
but
not
very
high
forehead
his
eyes
were
small
black
and
piercing
and
set
deep
in
his
head
his
aquiline
nose
thin
lips
and
broad
chin
were
the
very
reverse
of
african
in
their
shape
and
gave
his
face
a
very
singular
appearance
in
repose
his
countenance
was
severe
in
its
expression
but
when
engaged
in
agreeable
conversation
the
thin
lips
would
part
displaying
a
set
of
dazzlingly
white
teeth
and
the
small
black
eyes
would
sparkle
with
animation
the
neatness
and
care
with
which
he
was
dressed
added
to
the
attractiveness
of
his
appearance
his
linen
was
the
perfection
of
whiteness
and
his
snowy
vest
lost
nothing
by
its
contact
therewith
a
long
black
frock
coat
black
pants
and
boots
completed
his
attire
i
hope
said
he
your
house
suits
you
it
is
one
of
my
own
and
has
never
been
rented
except
for
a
short
time
to
a
careful
tenant
who
was
waiting
for
his
own
house
to
be
finished
i
think
you
will
find
it
comfortable
oh
perfectly
so
i
am
quite
sure
i
must
thank
you
for
the
prompt
manner
in
which
you
have
arranged
everything
for
us
it
seems
more
like
coming
to
an
old
home
than
to
a
new
residence
replied
garie
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
said
walters
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
call
and
pay
my
respects
to
garie
when
agreeable
to
her
depend
upon
it
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
make
our
quiet
city
pleasant
to
you
both
garie
thanked
him
and
after
some
further
conversation
rose
to
depart
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
he
stopped
before
the
picture
which
had
so
engaged
his
attention
when
walters
entered
so
you
too
are
attracted
by
that
picture
said
walters
with
a
smile
all
white
men
look
at
it
with
interest
a
black
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
general
officer
is
something
so
unusual
that
they
can
not
pass
it
with
a
glance
it
is
indeed
rather
a
novelty
replied
garie
particularly
to
a
person
from
my
part
of
the
country
who
is
it
that
is
toussaint
replied
walters
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
it
to
be
a
correct
likeness
it
was
presented
to
an
american
merchant
by
toussaint
himself
a
present
in
return
for
some
kindness
shown
him
this
merchant
son
not
having
the
regard
for
the
picture
that
his
father
entertained
for
it
sold
it
to
me
that
continued
walters
looks
like
a
man
of
intelligence
it
is
entirely
different
from
any
likeness
i
ever
saw
of
him
the
portraits
generally
represent
him
as
a
person
with
a
handkerchief
about
his
head
this
said
garie
gives
me
an
idea
of
the
man
that
accords
with
his
actions
thus
speaking
he
continued
looking
at
the
picture
for
a
short
time
and
then
took
his
departure
after
requesting
walters
to
call
upon
him
at
an
early
opportunity
chapter
xii
garie
neighbour
we
must
now
introduce
our
readers
into
the
back
parlour
of
the
house
belonging
to
garie
neighbour
thomas
stevens
we
find
this
gentleman
standing
at
a
window
that
overlooked
his
garden
enjoying
a
fragrant
havannah
his
appearance
was
not
by
any
means
prepossessing
he
was
rather
above
than
below
the
middle
height
with
round
shoulders
and
long
thin
arms
finished
off
by
hands
his
head
was
bald
on
the
top
and
the
thin
hair
that
grew
more
thickly
about
his
ears
was
coaxed
up
to
that
quarter
where
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
effect
such
a
union
between
the
cords
of
the
hair
from
each
side
as
should
cover
the
place
in
question
the
object
however
remained
unaccomplished
as
the
hair
was
either
very
obstinate
and
would
not
be
induced
to
lie
as
desired
or
from
extreme
modesty
objected
to
such
an
elevated
position
and
in
consequence
stopped
as
if
undecided
whether
to
lie
flat
or
remain
erect
producing
the
effect
that
would
have
been
presented
had
he
been
decorated
with
a
pair
of
horns
his
baldness
might
have
given
an
air
of
benevolence
to
his
face
but
for
the
shaggy
eyebrows
that
his
grey
eyes
his
cheekbones
were
high
and
the
cadaverous
skin
was
so
tightly
drawn
across
them
as
to
give
it
a
very
appearance
around
his
thin
compressed
lips
there
was
a
continual
nervous
twitching
that
added
greatly
to
the
sinister
aspect
of
his
face
on
the
whole
he
was
a
person
from
whom
you
would
instinctively
shrink
and
had
he
been
president
or
director
of
a
bank
in
which
you
had
money
deposited
his
general
aspect
would
not
have
given
you
additional
confidence
in
the
stable
character
or
just
administration
of
its
affairs
george
stevens
was
a
pettifogging
attorney
who
derived
a
tolerable
income
from
a
rather
disreputable
legal
practice
picked
up
among
the
courts
that
held
their
sessions
in
the
various
halls
of
the
he
was
known
in
the
profession
as
slippery
george
from
the
easy
manner
in
which
he
glided
out
of
scrapes
that
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
reputation
of
any
other
lawyer
did
a
man
break
into
a
house
and
escape
without
being
actually
caught
on
the
spot
with
the
goods
in
his
possession
stevens
was
always
able
to
prove
an
alibi
by
a
long
array
of
witnesses
in
fact
he
was
considered
by
the
swell
gentry
of
the
city
as
their
especial
friend
and
protector
and
by
the
members
of
the
bar
generally
as
anything
but
an
ornament
to
the
profession
he
had
had
rather
a
fatiguing
day
labour
and
on
the
evening
of
which
we
write
was
indulging
in
his
usual
cigar
and
amusing
himself
at
the
same
time
by
observing
the
gambols
of
clarence
and
little
em
who
were
enjoying
a
romp
in
their
father
garden
come
here
jule
said
he
and
look
at
our
new
children
rather
pretty
ai
they
he
was
joined
by
a
diminutive
woman
with
hair
and
eyes
very
much
like
his
own
and
a
face
that
wore
a
peevish
pinched
expression
rather
she
replied
after
observing
them
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
added
have
you
seen
their
parents
no
not
yet
was
the
reply
i
met
walters
in
the
street
this
morning
who
informed
me
they
are
from
the
south
and
very
rich
we
must
try
and
cultivate
them
ask
the
children
in
to
play
with
ours
and
strike
up
an
intimacy
in
that
way
the
rest
will
follow
naturally
you
know
by
the
way
jule
continued
he
how
i
hate
that
nigger
walters
with
his
grand
airs
i
wanted
some
money
of
him
the
other
day
on
rather
ticklish
securities
for
a
client
of
mine
and
the
black
wretch
kept
me
standing
in
his
hall
for
at
least
five
minutes
and
then
refused
me
with
some
not
very
complimentary
remarks
upon
my
assurance
in
offering
him
such
securities
it
made
me
so
mad
i
could
have
choked
him
it
is
bad
enough
to
be
treated
with
by
a
white
man
but
contempt
from
a
nigger
is
almost
unendurable
why
did
you
resent
it
in
some
way
i
never
would
have
submitted
to
anything
of
the
kind
from
him
interrupted
stevens
oh
i
do
dare
to
just
now
i
have
to
be
as
mild
as
milk
with
him
you
forget
about
the
mortgage
do
you
know
he
has
me
in
a
tight
place
there
and
i
do
see
how
to
get
out
of
it
either
if
i
am
called
slippery
george
i
tell
you
what
jule
there
not
a
better
man
of
business
in
the
whole
of
philadelphia
than
that
same
walters
nigger
as
he
is
and
no
one
offends
him
without
paying
dear
for
it
in
some
way
or
other
i
tell
you
something
he
did
last
week
he
went
up
to
trenton
on
business
and
at
the
hotel
they
refused
to
give
him
dinner
because
of
his
colour
and
told
him
they
did
not
permit
niggers
to
eat
at
their
tables
what
does
he
do
but
buy
the
house
over
the
landlord
head
the
lease
had
just
expired
and
the
landlord
was
anxious
to
negotiate
another
he
was
also
making
some
arrangements
with
his
creditors
which
could
not
be
effected
unless
he
was
enabled
to
renew
the
lease
of
the
premises
he
occupied
on
learning
that
the
house
had
been
sold
he
came
down
to
the
city
to
negotiate
with
the
new
owner
and
to
his
astonishment
found
him
to
be
the
very
man
he
had
refused
a
meal
to
the
week
before
blunt
happened
to
be
in
walters
office
at
the
time
the
fellow
called
walters
he
says
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
looked
like
an
ebony
statue
sir
said
he
i
came
to
your
house
and
asked
for
a
meal
for
which
i
was
able
to
pay
you
not
only
refused
it
to
me
but
heaped
upon
me
words
such
as
fall
only
from
the
lips
of
blackguards
you
refuse
to
have
me
in
your
house
i
object
to
have
you
in
mine
you
will
therefore
quit
the
premises
immediately
the
fellow
sneaked
out
quite
crestfallen
and
his
creditors
have
broken
him
up
completely
i
tell
you
what
jule
if
i
was
a
black
continued
he
living
in
a
country
like
this
i
sacrifice
conscience
and
everything
else
to
the
acquisition
of
wealth
as
he
concluded
he
turned
from
the
window
and
sat
down
by
a
small
table
upon
which
a
lighted
lamp
had
been
placed
and
where
a
few
law
papers
were
awaiting
a
perusal
a
little
boy
and
girl
were
sitting
opposite
to
him
the
boy
was
playing
with
a
small
wherein
he
had
already
imprisoned
a
vast
number
of
buzzing
sufferers
in
appearance
he
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
his
father
he
had
the
same
red
hair
and
sallow
complexion
but
his
grey
eyes
had
a
dull
leaden
hue
do
let
them
go
george
do
said
the
little
girl
in
a
pleading
tone
you
kill
them
shut
up
there
i
do
care
if
i
do
replied
he
doggedly
i
can
catch
more
look
here
and
as
he
spoke
he
permitted
a
few
of
the
imprisoned
insects
to
creep
partly
out
and
then
brought
the
lid
down
upon
them
with
a
force
that
completely
demolished
them
the
little
girl
shuddered
at
this
wanton
exhibition
of
cruelty
and
offered
him
a
paper
of
candy
if
he
would
liberate
his
prisoners
which
he
did
rather
reluctantly
but
promising
himself
to
replenish
the
box
at
the
first
opportunity
ah
said
he
in
a
tone
of
exultation
father
took
me
with
him
to
the
jail
and
i
saw
all
the
people
locked
up
i
mean
to
be
a
jailer
some
of
these
days
would
you
like
to
keep
a
jail
liz
continued
he
his
leaden
eyes
receiving
a
slight
accession
of
brightness
at
the
idea
oh
no
replied
she
i
would
let
all
the
people
go
if
i
kept
the
jail
a
more
complete
contrast
than
this
little
girl
presented
to
her
parents
and
brother
can
not
be
imagined
she
had
very
dark
chestnut
hair
and
mild
blue
eyes
and
a
round
full
face
which
in
expression
was
sweetness
itself
she
was
about
six
years
old
and
her
brother
junior
by
an
equal
number
of
years
her
mother
loved
her
but
thought
her
tame
and
spiritless
in
her
disposition
and
her
father
cherished
as
much
affection
for
her
as
he
was
capable
of
feeling
for
any
one
but
himself
stevens
however
doted
on
their
eldest
hope
who
was
as
disagreeable
as
a
thoroughly
spoiled
and
naturally
boy
could
be
as
the
evenings
had
now
become
quite
warm
garie
frequently
took
a
chair
and
enjoyed
his
evening
cigar
upon
the
of
his
house
and
as
stevens
thought
his
steps
equally
suited
to
this
purpose
it
was
very
natural
he
should
resort
there
with
the
same
object
stevens
found
no
difficulty
in
frequently
bringing
about
short
neighbourly
conversations
with
garie
the
little
folk
taking
their
cue
from
their
parents
soon
became
intimate
and
ran
in
and
out
of
each
other
houses
in
the
most
familiar
manner
possible
lizzy
stevens
and
little
em
joined
hearts
immediately
and
their
intimacy
had
already
been
cemented
by
frequent
consultations
on
the
various
ailments
wherewith
they
supposed
their
dolls
afflicted
clarence
got
on
only
tolerably
with
george
stevens
he
entertained
for
him
that
deference
that
one
boy
always
has
for
another
who
is
his
superior
in
any
boyish
pastime
but
there
was
little
affection
lost
between
them
they
cared
very
little
for
each
other
society
garie
since
her
arrival
had
been
much
confined
to
her
room
in
consequence
of
her
protracted
indisposition
stevens
had
several
times
intimated
to
garie
her
intention
of
paying
his
wife
a
visit
but
never
having
received
any
very
decided
encouragement
she
had
not
pressed
the
matter
though
her
curiosity
was
aroused
and
she
was
desirous
of
seeing
what
kind
of
person
garie
could
be
her
son
george
in
his
visits
had
never
been
permitted
farther
than
the
front
parlour
and
all
the
information
that
could
be
drawn
from
little
lizzy
who
was
frequently
in
garie
bedroom
was
that
she
was
a
pretty
lady
with
great
large
eyes
one
evening
when
garie
was
occupying
his
accustomed
seat
he
was
accosted
from
the
other
side
by
stevens
who
as
usual
was
very
particular
in
her
inquiries
after
the
state
of
his
wife
health
and
on
learning
that
she
was
so
much
improved
as
to
be
suggested
that
perhaps
she
would
be
willing
to
receive
her
no
doubt
she
will
rejoined
garie
and
he
immediately
entered
the
house
to
announce
the
intended
visit
the
lamps
were
not
lighted
when
stevens
was
introduced
and
faces
could
not
therefore
be
clearly
distinguished
my
dear
said
garie
this
is
our
neighbour
mrs
stevens
will
you
excuse
me
for
not
rising
said
garie
extending
her
hand
to
her
visitor
i
have
been
quite
ill
or
i
should
have
been
most
happy
to
have
received
you
before
my
little
folks
are
in
your
house
a
great
deal
i
hope
you
do
not
find
them
troublesome
oh
by
no
means
i
quite
dote
on
your
little
emily
she
is
such
a
sweet
child
so
very
affectionate
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
have
such
a
child
near
for
my
own
to
associate
with
they
have
got
quite
intimate
as
i
hope
we
soon
shall
be
garie
thanked
her
for
the
kindness
implied
in
the
wish
and
said
she
trusted
they
should
be
so
and
how
do
you
like
your
house
asked
stevens
it
is
on
the
same
plan
as
ours
and
we
find
ours
very
convenient
they
both
formerly
belonged
to
walters
my
husband
purchased
of
him
do
you
intend
to
buy
it
is
very
probable
we
shall
if
we
continue
to
like
philadelphia
answered
garie
i
delighted
to
hear
that
rejoined
she
very
glad
indeed
it
quite
relieves
my
mind
about
one
thing
ever
since
stevens
purchased
our
house
we
have
been
tormented
with
the
suspicion
that
walters
would
put
a
family
of
niggers
in
this
and
if
there
is
one
thing
in
this
world
i
detest
more
than
another
it
is
coloured
people
i
think
garie
here
interrupted
her
by
making
some
remark
quite
foreign
to
the
subject
with
the
intention
no
doubt
of
drawing
her
off
this
topic
the
attempt
was
however
an
utter
failure
for
she
continued
i
think
all
those
that
are
not
slaves
ought
to
be
sent
out
of
the
country
back
to
africa
where
they
belong
they
are
without
exception
the
most
ignorant
idle
miserable
set
i
ever
saw
i
think
said
garie
i
can
show
you
at
least
one
exception
and
that
too
without
much
trouble
sarah
he
cried
bring
me
a
light
oh
said
stevens
i
suppose
you
refer
to
walters
it
is
true
he
is
an
exception
but
he
is
the
only
coloured
person
i
ever
saw
that
could
make
the
least
pretension
to
anything
like
refinement
or
respectability
let
me
show
you
another
said
garie
as
he
took
the
lamp
from
the
servant
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
near
his
wife
as
the
light
fell
on
her
face
their
visitor
saw
that
she
belonged
to
the
very
class
that
she
had
been
abusing
in
such
unmeasured
terms
and
so
petrified
was
she
with
confusion
at
the
she
had
committed
that
she
was
entirely
unable
to
improvise
the
slightest
apology
garie
who
had
been
reclining
on
the
lounge
partially
raised
herself
and
gave
stevens
a
withering
look
i
presume
madam
said
she
in
a
hurried
and
agitated
tone
that
you
are
very
ignorant
of
the
people
upon
whom
you
have
just
been
heaping
such
unmerited
abuse
and
therefore
i
shall
not
think
so
hardly
of
you
as
i
should
did
i
deem
your
language
dictated
by
pure
hatred
but
be
its
origin
what
it
may
it
is
quite
evident
that
our
farther
acquaintance
could
be
productive
of
no
pleasure
to
either
of
us
you
will
therefore
permit
me
continued
she
rising
with
great
dignity
to
wish
you
good
evening
and
thus
speaking
she
left
the
room
stevens
was
completely
demolished
by
this
unexpected
of
her
visit
and
could
only
feebly
remark
to
garie
that
it
was
getting
late
and
she
would
go
and
rising
she
suffered
herself
to
be
politely
bowed
out
of
the
house
in
her
intense
anxiety
to
relate
to
her
husband
the
scene
which
had
just
occurred
she
could
not
take
time
to
go
round
and
through
the
gate
but
leaped
lightly
over
the
low
fence
that
divided
the
gardens
and
rushed
precipitately
into
the
presence
of
her
husband
good
heavens
george
what
do
you
think
she
exclaimed
i
had
such
a
surprise
i
should
think
that
you
had
judging
from
appearances
replied
he
why
your
eyes
are
almost
starting
out
of
your
head
what
on
earth
has
happened
he
asked
as
he
took
the
shade
off
the
lamp
to
get
a
better
view
of
his
amiable
partner
you
would
not
guess
in
a
year
she
rejoined
i
never
would
have
dreamed
it
i
never
was
so
struck
in
my
life
struck
with
what
do
talk
sensibly
jule
and
say
what
all
this
is
about
interrupted
her
husband
in
an
impatient
manner
come
out
with
it
what
has
happened
why
would
you
have
thought
it
said
she
garie
is
a
nigger
woman
a
real
nigger
she
would
be
known
as
such
anywhere
it
was
now
stevens
turn
to
be
surprised
why
jule
he
exclaimed
you
astonish
me
come
now
you
joking
you
do
mean
a
real
black
nigger
oh
no
not
jet
black
but
she
dark
enough
she
is
as
dark
as
that
sarah
we
employed
as
cook
some
time
ago
you
do
say
so
wonders
will
never
cease
and
he
such
a
gentleman
too
resumed
her
husband
yes
and
it
completely
sickening
continued
stevens
to
see
them
together
he
calls
her
my
dear
and
is
as
tender
and
affectionate
to
her
as
if
she
was
a
circassian
and
she
nothing
but
a
nigger
faugh
disgusting
little
clarence
had
been
standing
near
unnoticed
by
either
of
them
during
this
conversation
and
they
were
therefore
greatly
surprised
when
he
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
tears
my
mother
is
not
a
nigger
any
more
than
you
are
how
dare
you
call
her
such
a
bad
name
i
tell
my
father
stevens
gave
a
low
whistle
and
looking
at
his
wife
pointed
to
the
door
stevens
laid
her
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
clarence
and
led
him
to
the
door
saying
as
she
did
so
do
come
in
here
any
more
i
wish
you
to
come
into
my
house
and
then
closing
it
returned
to
her
husband
you
know
george
said
she
that
i
went
in
to
pay
her
a
short
visit
i
had
the
remotest
idea
that
she
was
a
coloured
woman
and
i
commenced
giving
my
opinion
respecting
niggers
very
freely
when
suddenly
her
husband
called
for
a
light
and
i
then
saw
to
whom
i
had
been
talking
you
may
imagine
my
astonishment
i
was
completely
dumb
and
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
have
seen
the
air
with
which
she
left
the
room
after
as
good
as
telling
me
to
leave
the
house
well
said
stevens
this
is
what
may
be
safely
termed
an
unexpected
event
but
jule
he
continued
you
had
better
pack
these
young
folks
off
to
bed
and
then
you
can
tell
me
the
rest
of
it
clarence
stood
for
some
time
on
the
steps
of
the
house
from
which
he
had
been
so
unkindly
ejected
with
his
little
heart
swelling
with
indignation
he
had
often
heard
the
term
nigger
used
in
its
reproachful
sense
but
never
before
had
it
been
applied
to
him
or
his
at
least
in
his
presence
it
was
the
first
blow
the
child
received
from
the
prejudice
whose
relentless
hand
was
destined
to
crush
him
in
it
was
his
custom
when
any
little
grief
pressed
upon
his
childish
heart
to
go
and
pour
out
his
troubles
on
the
breast
of
his
mother
but
he
instinctively
shrunk
from
confiding
this
to
her
for
child
as
he
was
he
knew
it
would
make
her
very
unhappy
he
therefore
gently
stole
into
the
house
crept
quietly
up
to
his
room
lay
down
and
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
chapter
xiii
hopes
consummated
to
emily
winston
we
have
always
accorded
the
title
of
garie
whilst
in
reality
she
had
no
legal
claim
to
it
whatever
previous
to
their
emigration
from
georgia
garie
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
attempted
but
without
success
to
make
her
legally
his
wife
he
ascertained
that
even
if
he
could
have
found
a
clergyman
willing
to
expose
himself
to
persecution
by
marrying
them
the
ceremony
itself
would
have
no
legal
weight
as
a
marriage
between
a
white
and
a
mulatto
was
not
recognized
as
valid
by
the
laws
of
the
state
and
he
had
therefore
been
compelled
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
until
an
opportunity
should
offer
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
wishes
now
however
that
they
had
removed
to
the
north
where
they
would
have
no
legal
difficulties
to
encounter
he
determined
to
put
his
former
intention
into
execution
although
emily
had
always
maintained
a
studied
silence
on
the
subject
he
knew
that
it
was
the
darling
wish
of
her
heart
to
be
legally
united
to
him
so
he
unhesitatingly
proceeded
to
arrange
matters
for
the
consummation
of
what
he
felt
assured
would
promote
the
happiness
of
both
he
therefore
wrote
to
blackly
a
distinguished
clergyman
of
the
city
requesting
him
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
received
from
him
an
assurance
that
he
would
be
present
at
the
appointed
time
matters
having
progressed
thus
far
he
thought
it
time
to
inform
emily
of
what
he
had
done
on
the
evening
succeeding
the
receipt
of
an
answer
from
the
rev
blackly
after
the
children
had
been
sent
to
bed
he
called
her
to
him
and
taking
her
hand
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
sofa
emily
said
he
as
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
my
dear
faithful
emily
i
am
about
to
do
you
an
act
of
justice
one
too
that
i
feel
will
increase
the
happiness
of
us
both
i
am
going
to
marry
you
my
darling
i
am
about
to
give
you
a
lawful
claim
to
what
you
have
already
won
by
your
faithfulness
and
devotion
you
know
i
tried
more
than
once
whilst
in
the
south
to
accomplish
this
but
owing
to
the
cruel
and
unjust
laws
existing
there
i
was
unsuccessful
but
now
love
no
such
difficulty
exists
and
here
continued
he
is
an
answer
to
the
note
i
have
written
to
blackly
asking
him
to
come
next
wednesday
night
and
perform
the
you
are
willing
are
you
not
emily
he
asked
willing
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
willing
oh
god
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
longed
for
it
it
has
been
my
earnest
desire
for
years
and
bursting
into
tears
she
leaned
sobbing
on
his
shoulder
after
a
few
moments
she
raised
her
head
and
looking
searchingly
in
his
face
she
asked
but
do
you
do
this
after
full
reflection
on
the
consequences
to
ensue
are
you
willing
to
sustain
all
the
odium
to
endure
all
the
contumely
to
which
your
acknowledged
union
with
one
of
my
unfortunate
race
will
subject
you
clarence
it
will
be
a
severe
trial
a
greater
one
than
any
you
have
yet
endured
for
me
and
one
for
which
i
fear
my
love
will
prove
but
a
poor
recompense
i
have
thought
more
of
these
things
lately
i
am
older
now
in
years
and
experience
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
vain
enough
to
think
that
my
affection
was
all
that
was
necessary
for
your
happiness
but
men
i
know
require
more
to
fill
their
cup
of
content
than
the
undivided
affection
of
a
woman
no
matter
how
fervently
beloved
you
have
talents
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
ambition
oh
clarence
how
it
would
grieve
me
in
to
know
that
you
regretted
that
for
me
you
had
sacrificed
all
those
views
and
hopes
that
are
cherished
by
the
generality
of
your
sex
have
you
weighed
it
well
yes
emily
well
replied
garie
and
you
know
the
conclusion
my
past
should
be
a
guarantee
for
the
future
i
had
the
world
before
me
and
chose
you
and
with
you
i
am
contented
to
share
my
lot
and
feel
that
i
receive
in
your
affection
a
full
reward
for
any
of
the
sacrifices
i
may
make
so
dry
your
tears
my
dear
concluded
he
and
let
us
hope
for
nothing
but
an
increase
of
happiness
as
the
result
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
he
resumed
it
will
be
necessary
emily
to
have
a
couple
of
witnesses
now
whom
would
you
prefer
i
would
suggest
ellis
and
her
husband
they
are
old
friends
and
persons
on
whose
prudence
we
can
rely
it
would
not
do
to
have
the
matter
talked
about
as
it
would
expose
us
to
disagreeable
comments
garie
agreed
perfectly
with
him
as
to
the
selection
of
and
ellis
and
immediately
despatched
a
note
to
ellis
asking
her
to
call
at
their
house
on
the
morrow
when
she
came
emily
informed
her
with
some
confusion
of
manner
of
the
intended
marriage
and
asked
her
attendance
as
witness
at
the
same
time
informing
her
of
the
high
opinion
her
husband
entertained
of
their
prudence
in
any
future
discussion
of
the
matter
i
am
really
glad
he
is
going
to
marry
you
emily
replied
ellis
and
depend
upon
it
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
aid
it
only
yesterday
that
inquisitive
tiddy
was
at
our
house
and
in
conversation
respecting
you
asked
if
i
knew
you
to
be
married
to
garie
i
turned
the
conversation
somehow
without
giving
her
a
direct
answer
garie
i
must
say
does
act
nobly
towards
you
he
must
love
you
emily
for
not
one
white
man
in
a
thousand
would
make
such
a
sacrifice
for
a
coloured
woman
you
ca
tell
how
we
all
like
him
he
is
so
amiable
so
kind
in
his
manner
and
makes
everyone
so
much
at
ease
in
his
company
it
real
good
in
him
i
declare
and
i
shall
begin
to
have
some
faith
in
white
folks
after
wednesday
night
continued
she
very
well
we
shall
be
here
if
the
lord
spare
us
and
kissing
emily
she
hurried
off
to
impart
the
joyful
intelligence
to
her
husband
the
anxiously
looked
for
wednesday
evening
at
last
arrived
and
emily
arrayed
herself
in
a
plain
white
dress
for
the
occasion
her
long
black
hair
had
been
arranged
in
ringlets
by
ellis
who
stood
by
gazing
admiringly
at
her
how
sweet
you
look
emily
you
only
want
a
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
to
complete
your
appearance
do
you
feel
a
little
nervous
asked
her
friend
a
little
excited
she
answered
and
her
hand
shook
as
she
put
back
one
of
the
curls
that
had
fallen
across
her
face
just
then
a
loud
ringing
at
the
door
announced
the
arrival
of
blackly
who
was
shown
into
the
front
parlour
emily
and
ellis
came
down
into
the
room
where
garie
was
waiting
for
them
whilst
ellis
brought
in
blackly
the
reverend
gentleman
gazed
with
some
surprise
at
the
party
assembled
garie
was
so
thoroughly
saxon
in
appearance
that
no
one
could
doubt
to
what
race
he
belonged
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
emily
ellis
and
her
husband
were
coloured
persons
blackly
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
evident
embarrassment
and
then
said
to
garie
in
a
low
hesitating
tone
i
think
there
has
been
some
mistake
here
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
step
into
another
room
garie
mechanically
complied
and
stood
waiting
to
learn
the
cause
of
blackly
strange
conduct
you
are
a
white
man
i
believe
at
last
stammered
forth
the
doctor
yes
sir
i
presume
my
appearance
is
a
sufficient
guarantee
of
that
answered
garie
oh
yes
i
do
not
doubt
it
and
for
that
reason
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
i
decline
to
proceed
with
the
ceremony
i
do
not
see
how
my
being
a
white
man
can
act
as
a
barrier
to
its
performance
remarked
garie
in
reply
it
would
not
sir
if
all
the
parties
were
of
one
complexion
but
i
do
not
believe
in
the
propriety
of
amalgamation
and
on
no
consideration
could
i
be
induced
to
assist
in
the
union
of
a
white
man
or
woman
with
a
person
who
has
the
slightest
infusion
of
african
blood
in
their
veins
i
believe
the
negro
race
he
continued
to
be
marked
out
by
the
hand
of
god
for
servitude
and
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
express
my
surprise
that
a
gentleman
of
your
evident
intelligence
should
seek
such
a
connection
you
must
be
labouring
under
some
horrible
infatuation
enough
sir
replied
garie
proudly
i
only
regret
that
i
did
not
know
it
was
necessary
to
relate
every
circumstance
of
appearance
complexion
i
wished
to
obtain
a
marriage
certificate
not
a
passport
i
mistook
you
for
a
which
mistake
you
will
please
to
consider
as
my
apology
for
having
troubled
you
and
thus
speaking
he
bowed
blackly
out
of
the
house
garie
stepped
back
to
the
door
of
the
parlour
and
called
out
ellis
we
are
placed
in
a
very
difficult
dilemma
said
he
as
he
was
joined
by
the
latter
would
you
believe
it
that
prejudiced
old
sinner
has
actually
refused
to
marry
us
it
is
no
more
than
you
might
have
expected
of
him
he
a
thorough
keeps
a
pew
behind
the
organ
of
his
church
for
coloured
people
and
will
not
permit
them
to
receive
the
sacrament
until
all
the
white
members
of
his
congregation
are
served
why
i
do
see
what
on
earth
induced
you
to
send
for
him
i
knew
nothing
of
his
sentiments
respecting
coloured
people
i
did
not
for
a
moment
have
an
idea
that
he
would
hesitate
to
marry
us
there
is
no
law
here
that
forbids
it
what
can
we
do
said
garie
despairingly
i
know
a
minister
who
will
marry
you
with
pleasure
if
i
can
only
catch
him
at
home
he
is
so
much
engaged
in
visiting
the
sick
and
other
pastoral
duties
do
go
hunt
him
up
ellis
it
will
be
a
great
favour
to
me
if
you
can
induce
him
to
come
poor
emily
what
a
disappointment
this
will
be
to
her
said
he
as
he
entered
the
room
where
she
was
sitting
what
is
the
matter
dear
she
asked
as
she
observed
garie
anxious
face
i
hope
there
is
no
new
difficulty
garie
briefly
explained
what
had
just
occurred
and
informed
her
in
addition
of
ellis
having
gone
to
see
if
he
could
get
father
banks
as
the
venerable
old
minister
was
called
it
seems
dear
said
she
despondingly
as
if
providence
looked
unfavourably
on
our
design
for
every
time
you
have
attempted
it
we
have
been
in
some
way
thwarted
and
the
tears
chased
one
another
down
her
face
which
had
grown
pale
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
oh
do
grieve
about
it
dear
it
is
only
a
temporary
disappointment
i
ca
think
all
the
clergymen
in
the
city
are
like
blackly
some
one
amongst
them
will
certainly
oblige
us
we
wo
despair
at
least
not
until
ellis
comes
back
they
had
not
very
long
to
wait
for
soon
after
this
conversation
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
garden
and
ellis
entered
followed
by
the
clergyman
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
they
were
united
by
father
banks
who
seemed
much
affected
as
he
pronounced
his
blessing
upon
them
my
children
he
said
tremulously
you
are
entering
upon
a
path
which
to
the
most
favoured
is
full
of
disappointment
care
and
anxieties
but
to
you
who
have
come
together
under
such
peculiar
circumstances
in
the
face
of
so
many
difficulties
and
in
direct
opposition
to
the
prejudices
of
society
it
will
be
fraught
with
more
danger
and
open
to
more
annoyances
than
if
you
were
both
of
one
race
but
if
men
revile
you
revile
not
again
bear
it
patiently
for
the
sake
of
him
who
has
borne
so
much
for
you
god
bless
you
my
children
said
he
and
after
shaking
hands
with
them
all
he
departed
and
ellis
took
their
leave
soon
after
and
then
garie
stole
upstairs
alone
into
the
room
where
the
children
were
sleeping
it
seemed
to
her
that
night
that
they
were
more
beautiful
than
ever
as
they
lay
in
their
little
beds
quietly
slumbering
she
knelt
beside
them
and
earnestly
prayed
their
heavenly
father
that
the
union
which
had
just
been
consummated
in
the
face
of
so
many
difficulties
might
prove
a
boon
to
them
all
where
have
you
been
you
runaway
exclaimed
her
husband
as
she
the
parlour
you
stayed
away
so
long
i
began
to
have
all
sorts
of
frightful
ideas
i
thought
of
the
hung
in
the
castle
hall
and
of
old
oak
chests
and
all
kind
of
terrible
things
i
been
sitting
here
alone
ever
since
the
ellises
went
where
have
you
been
oh
i
been
upstairs
looking
at
the
children
bless
their
young
hearts
they
looked
so
sweet
and
happy
and
how
they
grow
clarence
is
getting
to
be
quite
a
little
man
do
you
think
it
time
dear
that
he
was
sent
to
school
i
have
so
much
more
to
occupy
my
mind
here
than
i
had
in
georgia
so
many
household
duties
to
attend
to
that
i
am
unable
to
give
that
attention
to
his
lessons
which
i
feel
is
requisite
besides
being
so
much
at
home
he
has
associated
with
that
wretched
boy
of
the
stevens
and
is
growing
rude
and
noisy
do
you
think
he
had
better
be
sent
to
school
oh
yes
emily
if
you
wish
it
was
garie
reply
i
will
search
out
a
school
or
next
day
and
taking
out
his
watch
he
continued
it
is
near
twelve
how
the
night
has
flown
away
we
must
be
off
to
bed
after
the
excitement
of
the
evening
and
your
exertions
of
i
fear
that
you
will
be
indisposed
clarence
although
over
nine
years
old
was
so
backward
in
learning
that
they
were
obliged
to
send
him
to
a
small
primary
school
which
had
recently
been
opened
in
the
neighbourhood
and
as
it
was
one
for
children
of
both
sexes
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
send
little
em
with
him
i
do
so
dislike
to
have
her
go
said
her
mother
as
her
husband
proposed
that
she
should
accompany
clarence
she
seems
so
small
to
be
sent
to
school
i
afraid
she
wo
be
happy
oh
do
give
yourself
the
least
uneasiness
about
her
not
being
happy
there
for
a
more
cheerful
set
of
little
folks
i
never
beheld
you
would
be
astonished
to
see
how
exceedingly
young
some
of
them
are
what
kind
of
a
person
is
the
teacher
asked
garie
oh
she
a
charming
little
creature
the
very
embodiment
of
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
she
has
sparkling
black
eyes
a
round
rosy
face
and
be
more
than
sixteen
if
she
is
that
old
had
i
had
such
a
teacher
when
a
boy
i
should
have
got
on
charmingly
but
mine
was
a
cross
old
widow
who
wore
spectacles
and
took
an
amazing
quantity
of
snuff
and
used
to
flog
upon
the
slightest
pretence
i
went
into
her
presence
with
fear
and
trembling
i
could
never
learn
anything
from
her
and
that
must
be
my
excuse
for
my
present
literary
but
you
need
have
no
fear
respecting
em
getting
on
with
miss
jordan
i
do
believe
she
could
be
unkind
to
any
one
least
of
all
to
our
little
darling
then
you
will
take
them
down
in
the
morning
suggested
garie
but
on
no
account
leave
emily
unless
she
wishes
to
stay
chapter
xiv
charlie
at
warmouth
after
the
departure
of
bird
to
visit
her
sick
friend
betsey
turned
to
charlie
and
bid
him
follow
her
into
the
kitchen
i
suppose
you
been
to
breakfast
said
she
in
a
patronizing
manner
if
you
have
you
are
just
in
time
as
we
will
be
done
ours
in
a
little
while
and
then
you
can
have
yours
charlie
silently
followed
her
down
into
the
kitchen
where
a
and
the
younger
maid
were
already
at
breakfast
the
latter
arose
and
was
placing
another
plate
upon
the
table
when
betsey
frowned
and
nodded
disapprovingly
to
her
let
him
wait
whispered
she
i
not
going
to
eat
with
niggers
oh
he
such
a
nice
little
fellow
replied
eliza
in
an
undertone
let
him
eat
with
us
betsey
here
suggested
to
charlie
that
he
had
better
go
up
to
the
maple
chamber
wash
his
face
and
take
his
things
out
of
his
trunk
and
that
when
his
breakfast
was
ready
she
would
call
him
what
on
earth
can
induce
you
to
want
to
eat
with
a
nigger
asked
betsey
as
soon
as
charlie
was
out
of
hearing
i
could
do
it
my
victuals
would
turn
on
my
stomach
i
never
ate
at
the
same
table
with
a
nigger
in
my
life
nor
i
neither
rejoined
eliza
but
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
the
child
appears
to
have
good
manners
he
is
neat
and
and
because
god
has
curled
his
hair
more
than
he
has
ours
and
made
his
skin
a
little
darker
than
yours
or
mine
that
is
no
reason
we
should
treat
him
as
if
he
was
not
a
human
being
alfred
the
gardener
had
set
down
his
saucer
and
appeared
very
much
astonished
at
this
declaration
of
sentiment
on
the
part
of
eliza
and
sneeringly
remarked
you
an
abolitionist
i
suppose
no
i
am
not
replied
she
reddening
but
i
been
taught
that
god
made
all
alike
one
no
better
than
the
other
you
know
the
bible
says
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
well
if
it
does
rejoined
alfred
with
a
it
do
say
that
man
is
to
be
either
does
it
when
i
see
anything
in
my
bible
that
tells
me
i
to
eat
and
drink
with
niggers
i
do
it
and
not
before
i
suppose
you
think
that
all
the
slaves
ought
to
be
free
and
all
the
rest
of
the
darned
stuff
these
abolitionists
are
preaching
now
if
you
want
to
eat
with
the
nigger
you
can
nobody
wants
to
hinder
you
perhaps
he
may
marry
you
when
he
grows
up
do
you
think
you
had
better
set
your
cap
at
him
eliza
made
no
reply
to
this
low
taunt
but
ate
her
breakfast
in
silence
i
do
see
what
bird
brought
him
here
for
she
says
he
is
sick
had
a
broken
arm
or
something
i
ca
imagine
what
use
she
intends
to
make
of
him
remarked
betsey
i
do
think
she
intends
him
to
be
a
servant
here
at
any
rate
said
eliza
or
why
should
she
have
him
put
in
the
maple
chamber
when
there
are
empty
rooms
enough
in
the
garret
well
i
guess
i
know
what
she
brought
him
for
interposed
alfred
i
asked
her
before
she
went
away
to
get
a
little
boy
to
help
me
do
odd
jobs
now
that
reuben
is
about
to
leave
we
shall
want
a
boy
to
clean
the
boots
run
on
errands
drive
up
the
cows
and
do
other
little
chores
i
glad
he
a
black
boy
i
can
order
him
round
more
you
know
than
if
he
was
white
and
he
wo
get
his
back
up
half
as
often
either
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
what
bird
has
brought
him
here
for
the
gardener
having
convinced
himself
that
his
view
of
the
matter
was
the
correct
one
went
into
the
garden
for
his
day
labour
and
two
or
three
things
that
he
had
intended
doing
he
left
unfinished
with
the
benevolent
intention
of
setting
charlie
at
them
the
next
morning
footnote
a
yankeeism
meaning
little
jobs
about
a
farm
charlie
after
bathing
his
face
and
arranging
his
hair
looked
from
the
window
at
the
wide
expanse
of
country
spread
out
before
him
all
bright
and
glowing
in
the
warm
summer
sunlight
broad
fields
stretched
away
from
the
foot
of
the
garden
to
the
river
beyond
and
the
noise
of
the
waterfall
which
was
but
a
short
distance
off
was
distinctly
heard
and
the
sparkling
spray
was
clearly
visible
through
the
openings
of
the
trees
what
a
beautiful
place
what
grand
fields
to
run
in
an
orchard
too
full
of
blossoming
well
this
is
nice
exclaimed
charlie
as
his
eye
ran
over
the
prospect
but
in
the
midst
of
his
rapture
came
rushing
back
upon
him
the
remembrance
of
the
cavalier
treatment
he
had
met
with
and
he
said
with
a
sigh
as
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
but
it
is
not
home
after
all
just
at
this
moment
he
heard
his
name
called
by
betsey
and
he
hastily
descended
into
the
kitchen
at
one
end
of
the
table
a
clean
plate
and
knife
and
fork
had
been
placed
and
he
was
speedily
helped
to
the
remains
of
what
the
servants
had
been
eating
you
must
be
long
said
betsey
for
is
ironing
day
and
we
want
the
table
as
soon
as
possible
the
food
was
plentiful
and
good
but
charlie
could
not
eat
his
heart
was
full
and
heavy
the
child
felt
his
degradation
even
the
servants
refuse
to
eat
with
me
because
i
am
coloured
thought
he
oh
i
wish
i
was
at
home
why
do
you
eat
asked
betsey
i
do
think
i
want
any
breakfast
i
not
hungry
was
the
reply
i
hope
you
are
not
sulky
she
rejoined
we
do
like
sulky
boys
here
why
do
you
eat
she
repeated
the
sharp
cold
tones
of
her
voice
struck
a
chill
into
the
child
heart
and
his
lip
quivered
as
he
stammered
something
farther
about
not
being
hungry
and
he
hurried
away
into
the
garden
where
he
calmed
his
feelings
and
allayed
his
by
a
hearty
burst
of
tears
after
this
was
over
he
wandered
through
the
garden
and
fields
until
dinner
then
by
reading
his
book
and
by
another
walk
he
managed
to
get
through
the
day
the
following
morning
as
he
was
coming
down
stairs
he
was
met
by
alfred
who
accosted
him
with
oh
you
up
are
you
i
was
just
going
to
call
you
and
looking
at
charlie
from
head
to
foot
he
inquired
is
that
your
best
suit
no
it
my
worst
replied
charlie
i
have
two
suits
better
than
this
and
thinking
that
bird
had
arrived
he
continued
i
put
on
my
best
if
bird
wants
me
no
she
ai
home
was
the
reply
it
me
that
wants
you
come
down
here
i
got
a
little
job
for
you
take
this
said
he
handing
him
a
dirty
tow
apron
and
tie
it
around
your
neck
it
will
keep
the
blacking
off
your
clothes
you
know
now
continued
he
i
want
you
to
clean
these
boots
these
two
pairs
are
tyndall
them
you
need
not
be
particular
with
but
this
pair
is
mine
and
i
want
polished
up
high
now
mind
i
tell
you
i
going
to
wear
a
new
pair
of
pants
to
meetin
and
i
expect
to
cut
a
dash
so
you
do
up
slick
now
wo
you
i
do
my
best
said
charlie
who
although
he
did
not
dislike
work
could
not
relish
the
idea
of
cleaning
the
servants
boots
i
afraid
i
shall
find
this
a
queer
place
thought
he
i
shall
not
like
living
here
i
know
wait
for
my
meals
until
the
servants
have
finished
and
clean
their
boots
into
the
bargain
this
is
worse
than
being
with
mrs
thomas
charlie
however
went
at
it
with
a
will
and
was
busily
engaged
in
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
alfred
boots
when
he
heard
his
name
called
and
on
looking
up
saw
bird
upon
the
piazza
above
why
bless
me
child
what
are
you
about
whose
boots
are
those
and
why
are
you
cleaning
them
oh
he
replied
his
face
brightening
up
at
the
sight
of
bird
so
glad
you
come
those
are
tyndall
boots
and
these
he
continued
holding
up
the
boots
on
which
he
was
engaged
are
the
gardener
and
who
pray
instructed
you
to
clean
them
the
gardener
replied
charlie
he
did
did
he
said
bird
indignantly
very
well
now
do
you
take
off
that
apron
and
come
to
me
immediately
before
you
do
however
tell
alfred
i
want
him
charlie
quickly
divested
himself
of
the
tow
apron
and
after
having
informed
the
gardener
that
bird
desired
his
presence
in
the
parlour
he
ran
up
there
himself
alfred
came
lumbering
up
stairs
after
giving
his
boots
an
unusual
scraping
and
cleansing
preparatory
to
entering
upon
that
part
of
the
premises
which
to
him
was
generally
forbidden
ground
by
whose
direction
did
you
set
the
child
at
that
dirty
work
asked
bird
after
he
had
entered
the
room
i
had
anybody
direction
to
set
him
to
work
but
i
thought
you
brought
him
here
to
do
odd
jobs
you
know
i
asked
you
some
time
ago
to
get
a
boy
and
i
thought
this
was
the
one
and
if
he
had
been
you
would
have
taken
a
great
liberty
in
assigning
him
any
duties
without
first
consulting
me
but
he
is
not
a
servant
here
nor
do
i
intend
him
to
be
such
and
let
me
inform
you
that
instead
of
his
cleaning
your
boots
it
will
be
your
duty
henceforth
to
clean
his
now
continued
she
you
know
his
position
here
let
me
see
that
you
remember
yours
you
can
go
this
was
said
in
so
peremptory
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
room
for
discussion
or
rejoinder
and
alfred
with
a
chagrined
look
went
muttering
down
stairs
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
grumbled
he
i
to
wait
on
niggers
black
their
boots
and
drive
them
out
too
i
suppose
i
leave
at
once
if
it
was
such
a
good
situation
drat
the
old
picture
what
has
come
over
her
i
wonder
she
be
asking
old
aunt
charity
the
black
washerwoman
to
dine
with
her
next
she
has
either
gone
crazy
or
turned
abolitionist
i
do
know
which
something
has
happened
to
her
that
certain
now
charlie
said
bird
as
the
door
closed
upon
the
gardener
go
to
your
room
and
dress
yourself
nicely
after
i
eaten
my
breakfast
i
am
going
to
visit
a
friend
and
i
want
you
to
accompany
me
do
be
long
ca
i
eat
mine
first
mrs
bird
he
asked
in
reply
i
thought
you
had
had
yours
long
ago
rejoined
she
the
others
had
finished
theirs
when
you
called
me
and
i
do
get
mine
until
they
have
done
said
charlie
until
they
have
done
how
happens
that
asked
bird
i
think
they
do
like
to
eat
with
me
because
i
coloured
was
charlie
hesitating
reply
that
is
too
much
exclaimed
bird
if
it
were
not
so
very
ridiculous
i
should
be
angry
it
remains
for
me
then
continued
she
to
set
them
an
example
i
not
eaten
my
breakfast
yet
come
sit
down
with
me
and
we
have
it
together
charlie
followed
bird
into
the
and
took
the
seat
pointed
out
by
her
eliza
when
she
entered
with
the
opened
her
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
at
the
singular
spectacle
she
beheld
her
mistress
sitting
down
to
breakfast
to
a
little
coloured
boy
depositing
the
urn
upon
the
table
she
hastened
back
to
the
kitchen
to
report
upon
the
startling
events
that
were
occurring
in
the
well
i
never
said
she
that
beats
anything
i
ever
did
see
why
bird
must
have
turned
abolitionist
charlie
is
actually
sitting
at
the
same
table
with
her
eating
his
breakfast
as
natural
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
was
as
white
as
snow
wonders
never
will
cease
you
see
i
right
though
i
said
that
child
was
brought
here
for
a
servant
we
done
it
for
ourselves
now
only
think
how
mad
she
be
when
she
finds
he
was
made
to
wait
for
his
meals
until
we
have
done
i
glad
i
was
the
one
who
refused
to
eat
with
him
i
guess
she
has
been
giving
alfred
a
blowing
up
said
betsy
for
setting
him
at
boot
cleaning
for
he
looked
like
a
when
he
came
down
stairs
and
was
muttering
something
about
a
consarned
he
looked
anything
but
pleased
whilst
the
lower
powers
were
discussing
what
they
were
pleased
to
regard
as
an
evidence
of
some
mental
derangement
on
the
part
of
bird
that
lady
was
questioning
charlie
respecting
his
studies
and
inquired
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
school
in
warmouth
after
a
while
i
think
i
should
he
replied
but
for
a
week
i
like
to
be
free
to
run
about
the
fields
and
go
fishing
and
do
lots
of
things
this
is
such
a
pretty
place
and
now
that
you
have
come
i
shall
have
nice
times
i
know
i
shall
you
seem
to
have
great
confidence
in
my
ability
to
make
you
happy
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
as
kind
as
you
seem
to
suppose
asked
bird
with
a
smile
i
know
you
are
answered
charlie
confidently
you
speak
so
pleasantly
to
me
and
do
you
know
bird
continued
he
that
i
liked
you
from
the
first
day
when
you
praised
me
so
kindly
when
i
recited
my
lessons
before
you
did
you
ever
have
any
little
boys
of
your
own
a
change
immediately
came
over
the
countenance
of
bird
as
she
replied
oh
yes
charlie
a
sweet
good
boy
about
your
own
age
and
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
continued
he
accompanied
his
father
to
england
years
ago
the
ship
in
which
they
sailed
was
never
heard
of
his
name
was
charlie
too
i
did
know
that
or
i
should
not
have
asked
said
charlie
with
some
embarrassment
of
manner
caused
by
the
pain
he
saw
he
had
inflicted
i
am
very
sorry
he
continued
bird
motioned
him
to
finish
his
breakfast
and
left
the
table
without
drinking
the
tea
she
had
poured
out
for
herself
there
were
but
one
or
two
families
of
coloured
people
living
in
the
small
town
of
warmouth
and
they
of
a
very
humble
description
their
faces
were
familiar
to
all
the
inhabitants
and
their
appearance
was
in
accordance
with
their
humble
condition
therefore
when
charlie
made
his
debut
in
company
with
bird
his
dress
and
manners
differed
so
greatly
from
what
they
were
accustomed
to
associate
with
persons
of
his
complexion
that
he
created
quite
a
sensation
in
the
streets
of
the
usually
quiet
and
obscure
little
town
he
was
attired
with
great
neatness
and
not
having
an
opportunity
of
playing
marbles
in
his
new
suit
it
still
maintained
its
spotless
appearance
the
fine
grey
broadcloth
coat
and
pants
fitted
him
to
a
nicety
the
jaunty
cap
was
set
slightly
on
one
side
of
his
head
giving
him
a
somewhat
saucy
look
and
the
fresh
colour
now
returning
to
his
cheeks
imparted
to
his
face
a
much
healthier
appearance
than
it
had
worn
for
months
he
and
his
kind
friend
walked
on
together
for
some
time
chatting
about
the
various
things
that
attracted
their
attention
on
the
way
until
they
reached
a
cottage
in
the
garden
of
which
a
gentleman
was
busily
engaged
in
training
a
rosebush
upon
a
new
trellis
so
completely
was
he
occupied
with
his
pursuit
that
he
did
not
observe
the
entrance
of
visitors
and
quite
started
when
he
was
gently
tapped
upon
the
shoulder
by
bird
how
busy
we
are
said
she
gaily
at
the
same
time
extending
her
hand
so
deeply
engaged
that
we
can
scarcely
notice
old
friends
that
we
have
not
seen
for
months
indeed
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
he
remarked
when
he
saw
by
whom
he
had
been
interrupted
when
did
you
arrive
only
this
morning
and
as
usual
i
have
already
found
something
with
which
to
bore
you
you
know
whately
i
always
have
something
to
trouble
you
about
do
say
trouble
my
dear
bird
if
you
will
say
me
something
to
occupy
my
time
usefully
and
agreeably
you
will
come
much
nearer
the
mark
but
who
is
this
you
have
with
you
oh
a
little
of
mine
poor
little
fellow
he
met
with
a
sad
accident
recently
he
broke
his
arm
and
i
have
brought
him
down
here
to
recruit
charlie
walk
around
and
look
at
the
garden
i
have
a
little
matter
of
business
to
discuss
with
whately
and
when
we
shall
have
finished
i
will
call
you
whately
led
the
way
into
his
library
and
placing
a
seat
for
bird
awaited
her
communication
you
have
great
influence
with
the
teacher
of
the
academy
i
believe
said
she
a
little
replied
whately
smiling
not
a
little
rejoined
bird
but
a
great
deal
and
my
dear
whately
i
want
you
to
exercise
it
in
my
behalf
i
wish
to
enter
as
a
scholar
that
little
boy
i
brought
with
me
this
morning
impossible
said
whately
my
good
friend
the
boy
is
coloured
i
am
well
aware
of
that
continued
bird
if
he
were
not
there
would
not
be
the
least
trouble
about
his
admission
nor
am
i
sure
there
will
be
as
it
is
if
you
espouse
his
cause
one
who
has
been
such
a
benefactor
to
the
academy
as
yourself
could
i
suppose
accomplish
anything
yes
but
that
is
stretching
my
influence
unduly
i
would
be
willing
to
oblige
you
in
almost
anything
else
but
i
hesitate
to
attempt
this
why
not
send
him
to
the
public
school
they
have
a
separate
bench
for
black
children
he
can
be
taught
there
all
that
is
necessary
for
him
to
know
he
is
far
in
advance
of
any
of
the
scholars
there
i
attended
the
examination
of
the
school
to
which
he
was
attached
said
bird
and
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
the
acquirements
of
the
pupils
this
lad
was
distinguished
above
all
the
rest
he
answered
questions
that
would
have
puzzled
older
heads
with
the
greatest
facility
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
to
get
him
admitted
to
the
academy
as
i
am
confident
he
will
do
honour
to
the
interest
i
take
in
him
and
a
very
warm
interest
it
must
be
my
dear
bird
to
induce
you
to
attempt
placing
him
in
such
an
expensive
and
exclusive
school
i
am
very
much
afraid
you
will
have
to
give
it
up
many
of
the
scholars
parents
i
am
sure
will
object
strenuously
to
the
admission
of
a
coloured
boy
as
a
scholar
only
tell
me
that
you
will
propose
him
and
i
will
risk
the
refusal
replied
bird
it
can
be
tried
at
all
events
and
if
you
will
make
the
effort
i
shall
be
under
deep
obligations
to
you
well
bird
let
us
grant
him
admitted
what
benefit
can
accrue
to
the
lad
from
an
education
beyond
his
station
he
can
not
enter
into
any
of
the
learned
professions
both
whilst
he
is
there
and
after
his
education
is
finished
he
will
be
like
a
fish
out
of
water
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
say
i
think
in
this
case
your
benevolence
misdirected
the
boy
parents
are
poor
i
presume
they
certainly
are
not
rich
rejoined
bird
and
it
is
for
that
reason
i
wish
to
do
all
that
i
can
for
him
if
i
can
keep
him
with
me
and
give
him
a
good
education
it
may
be
greatly
for
his
advantage
there
may
be
a
great
change
in
public
sentiment
before
he
is
a
man
we
can
not
say
what
opening
there
may
be
for
him
in
the
future
not
unless
it
changes
very
much
i
never
knew
prejudice
more
rampant
than
it
is
at
this
hour
to
get
the
boy
admitted
as
a
right
is
totally
out
of
the
question
if
he
is
received
at
all
it
will
be
as
a
special
favour
and
a
favour
which
i
am
sure
it
will
require
all
my
influence
to
obtain
i
will
set
about
it
immediately
and
rely
upon
it
i
will
do
my
best
for
your
satisfied
with
the
promise
which
was
as
much
as
bird
had
dared
to
hope
for
she
called
charlie
then
shook
hands
with
whately
and
departed
chapter
xv
stevens
gains
a
triumph
the
garies
had
now
become
thoroughly
settled
in
philadelphia
and
amongst
the
people
of
colour
had
obtained
a
very
extensive
and
agreeable
acquaintance
at
the
south
garie
had
never
borne
the
reputation
of
an
active
person
having
an
ample
fortune
and
a
thoroughly
southern
distaste
for
labour
he
found
it
by
no
means
inconvenient
or
unpleasant
to
have
so
much
time
at
his
disposal
his
newspaper
in
the
morning
a
good
book
a
stroll
upon
the
fashionable
promenade
and
a
ride
at
dusk
enabled
him
to
dispose
of
his
time
without
being
oppressed
with
it
was
far
happier
for
him
that
such
was
his
disposition
as
his
domestic
relations
would
have
been
the
means
of
subjecting
him
to
many
unpleasant
circumstances
from
which
his
comparative
retirement
in
a
great
measure
screened
him
once
or
twice
since
his
settlement
in
the
north
his
feelings
had
been
ruffled
by
the
sneering
remarks
of
some
of
his
former
friends
upon
the
singularity
of
his
domestic
position
but
his
irritation
had
all
fled
before
the
smiles
of
content
and
happiness
that
beamed
from
the
faces
of
his
wife
and
children
garie
had
nothing
left
to
wish
for
she
was
surrounded
by
every
physical
comfort
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
frequent
intercourse
with
intelligent
and
refined
people
and
had
been
greatly
attracted
toward
esther
ellis
with
whom
she
had
become
very
intimate
one
morning
in
november
these
two
were
in
the
elegant
little
of
garie
where
a
fire
had
been
kindled
as
the
weather
was
growing
very
chilly
and
disagreeable
it
begins
to
look
quite
like
autumn
said
garie
rising
and
looking
out
of
the
window
the
chrysanthemums
are
drooping
and
withered
and
the
dry
leaves
are
whirling
and
skimming
through
the
air
i
wonder
she
continued
if
the
children
were
well
wrapped
up
this
morning
oh
yes
i
met
them
at
the
corner
on
their
way
to
school
looking
as
warm
and
rosy
as
possible
what
beautiful
children
they
are
little
em
has
completely
won
my
heart
it
really
seems
a
pity
for
her
to
be
put
on
the
shelf
as
she
must
be
soon
how
what
do
you
mean
asked
garie
oh
this
will
explain
archly
rejoined
esther
as
she
held
up
to
view
one
of
the
tiny
lace
trimmed
frocks
that
she
was
making
in
anticipation
of
the
event
that
has
been
previously
hinted
garie
laughed
and
turned
to
look
out
of
the
window
again
do
you
know
i
found
little
lizzy
stevens
your
neighbour
daughter
shivering
upon
the
steps
in
a
neighbouring
street
fairly
blue
with
cold
she
was
waiting
there
for
clarence
and
em
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
to
go
on
without
them
but
she
would
not
from
what
i
could
understand
she
waits
for
them
there
every
day
her
mother
can
not
be
aware
of
it
then
for
she
has
forbidden
her
children
to
associate
with
mine
rejoined
garie
i
wonder
she
permits
her
little
girl
to
go
to
the
same
school
i
do
think
she
knows
it
or
it
is
very
likely
she
would
take
her
away
has
she
ever
spoken
to
you
since
the
night
of
her
visit
asked
esther
never
i
have
seen
her
a
great
many
times
since
she
never
speaks
nor
do
i
there
she
goes
now
that
continued
garie
with
a
smile
is
another
illustration
of
the
truthfulness
of
the
old
adage
of
well
i
wo
say
who
he
is
sure
to
appear
and
thus
speaking
she
turned
from
the
window
and
was
soon
deeply
occupied
in
the
important
work
of
preparing
for
the
expected
little
stranger
garie
was
mistaken
in
her
supposition
that
stevens
was
unaware
that
clarence
and
little
em
attended
the
same
school
to
which
her
own
little
girl
had
been
sent
for
the
evening
before
the
conversation
we
have
just
narrated
she
had
been
discussing
the
matter
with
her
husband
here
said
she
to
him
is
miss
jordan
bill
for
the
last
quarter
i
shall
never
pay
her
another
i
am
going
to
remove
lizzy
from
that
school
remove
her
what
for
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
jule
that
the
child
got
on
excellently
well
there
that
she
improved
very
fast
so
she
does
as
far
as
learning
is
concerned
but
she
is
sitting
right
next
to
one
of
those
garie
children
and
that
is
an
arrangement
i
do
at
all
fancy
i
do
relish
the
idea
of
my
child
attending
the
same
school
that
niggers
do
so
i
come
to
the
determination
to
take
her
away
i
should
do
no
such
thing
coolly
remarked
stevens
i
should
compel
the
teacher
to
dismiss
the
garies
or
i
should
break
up
her
school
those
children
have
no
right
to
be
there
whatever
i
do
care
a
straw
how
light
their
complexions
are
they
are
niggers
nevertheless
and
ought
to
go
to
a
nigger
school
they
are
no
better
than
any
other
coloured
children
tell
you
what
you
can
do
jule
continued
he
call
on
kinney
the
roths
and
one
or
two
others
and
induce
them
to
say
that
if
miss
jordan
wo
dismiss
the
garies
that
they
will
withdraw
their
children
and
you
know
if
they
do
it
will
break
up
the
school
entirely
if
it
was
any
other
person
children
but
his
i
would
wink
at
it
but
i
want
to
give
him
a
fall
for
his
confounded
haughtiness
just
try
that
plan
jule
and
you
will
be
sure
to
succeed
i
am
not
so
certain
about
it
stevens
miss
jordan
i
learn
is
very
fond
of
their
little
em
i
must
say
i
can
not
wonder
at
it
she
is
the
most
loveable
little
creature
i
ever
saw
i
will
say
that
if
her
mother
is
a
nigger
yes
jule
all
that
may
be
but
i
know
the
world
well
enough
to
judge
that
when
she
becomes
fully
assured
that
it
will
conflict
with
her
interests
to
keep
them
she
will
give
them
up
she
is
too
poor
to
be
philanthropic
and
i
believe
has
sufficient
good
sense
to
know
it
well
i
try
your
plan
said
stevens
i
will
put
matters
in
train
morning
early
the
next
morning
stevens
might
have
been
seen
directing
her
steps
to
the
house
of
kinney
with
whom
she
was
very
intimate
she
reached
it
just
as
that
lady
was
departing
to
preside
at
a
meeting
of
a
female
missionary
society
for
evangelizing
the
patagonians
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
accompany
me
to
the
meeting
said
she
to
stevens
as
soon
as
they
had
exchanged
the
usual
courtesies
oh
dear
no
i
wish
i
was
she
replied
i
got
a
troublesome
little
matter
on
my
hands
and
last
night
my
husband
suggested
my
coming
to
ask
your
advice
respecting
it
george
has
such
a
high
opinion
of
your
judgment
that
he
would
insist
on
my
troubling
you
kinney
smiled
and
looked
gratified
at
this
tribute
to
her
importance
and
moreover
continued
stevens
it
a
matter
in
which
your
interest
as
well
as
our
own
is
concerned
kinney
now
began
to
look
quite
interested
and
untying
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
exclaimed
dear
me
what
can
it
be
knowing
said
stevens
that
you
entertain
just
the
same
sentiments
that
we
do
relative
to
associating
with
coloured
people
i
thought
i
would
call
and
ask
if
you
were
aware
that
miss
jordan
receives
coloured
as
well
as
white
children
in
her
school
why
no
my
dear
stevens
you
astound
me
i
had
the
remotest
idea
of
such
a
thing
it
is
very
strange
my
children
never
mentioned
it
oh
children
are
so
taken
up
with
their
play
they
forget
such
things
rejoined
stevens
now
continued
she
husband
said
he
was
quite
confident
you
would
not
permit
your
children
to
continue
their
attendance
after
this
knowledge
came
to
your
ears
we
both
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
break
up
the
poor
girl
school
by
withdrawing
our
children
without
first
ascertaining
if
she
would
expel
the
little
darkies
i
knew
if
i
could
persuade
you
to
let
me
use
your
name
as
well
as
ours
and
say
that
you
will
not
permit
your
children
to
continue
at
her
school
unless
she
consents
to
our
wishes
she
knowing
the
influence
you
possess
would
i
am
sure
accede
to
our
demands
immediately
oh
you
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
use
my
name
stevens
and
say
all
that
you
think
necessary
to
effect
your
object
but
do
excuse
me
for
hurrying
off
she
continued
looking
at
her
watch
i
was
to
have
been
at
the
meeting
at
ten
and
it
is
now
i
hope
you
wo
fail
to
call
and
let
me
know
how
you
succeed
and
with
her
heart
overflowing
with
tender
care
for
the
poor
patagonian
kinney
hastily
departed
that
settled
soliloquized
stevens
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
as
she
descended
the
steps
her
four
children
would
make
a
serious
gap
in
the
little
school
and
now
then
continued
she
for
the
roths
stevens
found
not
the
slightest
difficulty
in
persuading
roth
to
allow
her
name
to
be
used
in
connection
with
kinney
in
the
threat
to
withdraw
their
children
if
the
little
garies
were
not
immediately
expelled
roth
swore
by
kinney
and
the
mere
mention
of
that
lady
name
was
sufficient
to
enlist
her
aid
thus
armed
stevens
lost
no
time
in
paying
a
visit
to
miss
school
as
she
entered
the
busy
hum
of
childish
voices
was
somewhat
stilled
and
lizzy
stevens
touched
little
em
who
sat
next
her
and
whispered
there
is
my
mother
stevens
was
welcomed
very
cordially
by
miss
jordan
who
offered
her
the
seat
of
honour
beside
her
your
school
seems
quite
flourishing
she
remarked
after
looking
around
the
room
and
i
really
regret
being
obliged
to
make
a
gap
in
your
interesting
circle
i
hope
you
do
intend
to
deprive
me
of
your
little
girl
inquired
miss
jordan
i
should
regret
to
part
with
her
not
only
because
i
am
very
fond
of
her
but
in
consideration
of
her
own
interest
she
is
coming
on
so
rapidly
oh
i
have
the
slightest
fault
to
find
with
her
progress
said
she
is
not
the
reason
i
have
another
of
much
more
weight
of
course
every
one
is
at
liberty
to
do
as
they
choose
and
we
have
no
right
to
dictate
to
you
what
description
of
scholars
you
should
receive
but
if
they
are
not
such
as
we
think
proper
companions
for
our
children
you
ca
complain
if
we
withdraw
them
i
really
do
not
understand
you
stevens
said
the
teacher
with
an
astonished
look
i
have
none
here
but
the
children
of
the
most
respectable
persons
they
are
all
as
well
behaved
as
school
children
generally
are
i
did
not
allude
to
behaviour
that
for
all
that
i
know
to
the
contrary
is
irreproachable
it
is
not
character
that
is
in
question
but
colour
i
do
like
my
daughter
to
associate
with
coloured
children
coloured
children
repeated
the
now
thoroughly
bewildered
teacher
coloured
children
my
dear
madam
continued
she
smiling
some
one
has
been
hoaxing
you
i
have
no
coloured
pupils
i
could
not
be
induced
to
receive
one
on
any
account
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
rejoined
stevens
for
that
convinces
me
that
my
fears
were
groundless
i
was
under
the
impression
you
had
imbibed
some
of
those
pestilent
abolition
sentiments
coming
into
vogue
i
see
you
are
not
aware
of
it
but
you
certainly
have
two
coloured
scholars
and
there
said
she
pointing
to
clarence
is
one
of
them
clarence
who
with
his
head
bent
over
his
book
was
sitting
so
near
as
to
overhear
a
part
of
this
conversation
now
looked
up
and
found
the
cold
malignant
grey
eyes
of
stevens
fastened
on
him
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
then
apparently
resumed
his
studies
the
poor
boy
had
when
she
entered
the
room
an
instinctive
knowledge
that
her
visit
boded
no
good
to
them
he
was
beginning
to
learn
the
anomalous
situation
he
was
to
fill
in
society
he
had
detested
stevens
ever
since
the
night
she
had
ejected
him
so
rudely
from
her
house
and
since
then
had
learned
to
some
extent
what
was
meant
by
the
term
you
must
certainly
be
misinformed
responded
miss
jordan
i
know
their
father
he
has
frequently
been
here
he
is
a
southerner
a
thorough
gentleman
in
his
manners
and
if
ever
a
man
was
white
i
am
sure
he
is
have
you
seen
their
mother
asked
stevens
significantly
no
i
never
have
replied
miss
jordan
she
is
in
poor
health
but
she
must
unquestionably
be
a
white
woman
a
glance
at
the
children
ought
to
convince
you
of
that
it
might
if
i
had
not
seen
her
and
did
not
know
her
to
be
a
coloured
woman
you
see
my
dear
miss
jordan
continued
she
in
her
blandest
tone
i
am
their
neighbour
and
have
seen
their
mother
twenty
times
and
more
she
is
a
coloured
woman
beyond
all
doubt
i
never
could
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
exclaimed
miss
jordan
as
an
anxious
look
overspread
her
face
then
after
a
pause
she
continued
i
do
not
see
what
i
am
to
do
it
is
really
too
unfortunate
i
do
know
how
to
act
it
seems
unjust
and
unchristian
to
eject
two
such
children
from
my
school
because
their
mother
has
the
misfortune
to
have
a
few
drops
of
african
blood
in
her
veins
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
why
you
yourself
must
admit
that
they
are
as
white
as
any
children
in
the
room
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
they
are
but
they
have
nigger
blood
in
them
notwithstanding
and
they
are
therefore
as
much
niggers
as
the
blackest
and
have
no
more
right
to
associate
with
white
children
than
if
they
were
black
as
ink
i
have
no
more
liking
for
white
niggers
than
for
black
ones
the
teacher
was
perplexed
and
turning
to
stevens
said
imploringly
this
matter
seems
only
known
to
you
let
me
appeal
to
your
generosity
say
nothing
more
about
it
i
will
try
to
keep
your
daughter
away
from
them
if
you
wish
but
pray
do
not
urge
me
to
the
performance
of
an
act
that
i
am
conscious
would
be
unjust
stevens
face
assumed
a
severe
and
disagreeable
expression
i
hoped
you
would
look
at
this
matter
in
a
reasonable
light
and
not
compel
those
who
would
be
your
friends
to
appear
in
the
light
of
enemies
if
this
matter
was
known
to
me
alone
i
should
remove
my
daughter
and
say
nothing
more
about
it
but
unfortunately
for
you
i
find
that
by
some
means
or
other
both
kinney
and
roth
have
become
informed
of
the
circumstance
and
are
determined
to
take
their
children
away
i
thought
i
would
act
a
friend
part
by
you
and
try
to
prevail
on
you
to
dismiss
these
two
coloured
children
at
once
i
so
far
relied
upon
your
right
judgment
as
to
assure
them
that
you
would
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
comply
with
their
wishes
and
i
candidly
tell
you
that
it
was
only
by
my
so
doing
that
they
were
prevented
from
keeping
their
children
at
home
miss
jordan
looked
aghast
at
this
startling
intelligence
if
roth
and
kinney
withdrew
their
patronage
and
influence
her
little
school
the
sole
support
of
her
mother
and
herself
would
be
broken
up
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sat
in
silence
for
a
few
seconds
then
looking
at
stevens
with
tearful
eyes
exclaimed
god
forgive
me
if
it
must
be
so
nothing
but
the
utter
ruin
that
stares
me
in
the
face
if
i
refuse
induces
me
to
accede
to
your
request
i
am
sorry
that
you
distress
yourself
so
much
about
it
you
know
you
are
your
own
mistress
and
can
do
as
you
choose
said
stevens
but
if
you
will
be
advised
by
me
you
will
send
them
away
at
once
after
school
i
will
hesitatingly
replied
miss
jordan
i
hate
to
appear
so
pressing
resumed
stevens
but
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
suggest
that
you
had
better
do
it
at
once
and
before
the
rest
of
the
scholars
i
did
not
wish
to
inform
you
to
what
extent
this
thing
had
gone
but
it
really
has
been
talked
of
in
many
quarters
and
it
is
generally
supposed
that
you
are
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
the
garies
are
coloured
therefore
you
see
the
necessity
of
doing
something
at
once
to
vindicate
yourself
from
the
reproach
of
abolitionism
at
the
pronunciation
of
this
then
terrible
word
in
such
connection
with
herself
miss
jordan
turned
quite
pale
and
for
a
moment
struggled
to
acquire
sufficient
control
of
her
feelings
to
enable
her
to
do
as
stevens
suggested
at
last
bursting
into
tears
she
said
oh
i
can
not
will
not
do
it
i
dismiss
them
but
not
in
that
unfeeling
manner
that
i
can
not
do
the
children
were
now
entirely
neglecting
their
lessons
and
seemed
much
affected
by
miss
jordan
tears
of
which
they
could
not
understand
the
cause
she
observing
this
rang
the
bell
the
usual
signal
for
intermission
stevens
satisfied
with
the
triumph
she
had
effected
took
leave
of
miss
jordan
after
commending
her
for
the
sensible
conclusion
at
which
she
had
arrived
and
promising
to
procure
her
two
more
pupils
in
the
room
of
those
she
was
about
to
dismiss
miss
jordan
was
a
long
time
writing
the
note
that
she
intended
sending
to
garie
and
one
of
the
elder
girls
returned
to
the
wondering
at
the
unusually
long
time
that
had
been
given
for
recreation
tell
clarence
and
his
sister
to
come
here
said
she
to
the
girl
who
had
just
entered
and
whilst
they
were
on
their
way
upstairs
she
folded
the
note
and
was
directing
it
when
clarence
entered
clarence
said
she
in
a
soft
voice
put
on
your
hat
i
have
a
note
of
some
importance
for
you
to
take
to
your
father
your
father
remember
give
it
to
any
one
else
taking
out
her
watch
she
continued
it
is
now
so
late
that
you
would
scarcely
get
back
before
the
time
for
dismissal
so
you
had
better
take
little
emily
home
with
you
i
hope
i
have
done
anything
wrong
asked
clarence
oh
no
quickly
replied
she
you
a
dear
good
boy
and
have
never
given
me
a
moment
pain
since
you
came
to
the
school
and
she
hurried
out
into
the
hall
to
avoid
farther
questioning
she
could
not
restrain
the
tears
as
she
dressed
little
em
whose
eyes
were
large
with
astonishment
at
being
sent
home
from
school
at
so
early
an
hour
teacher
is
school
out
asked
she
no
dear
not
quite
i
wanted
to
send
a
note
to
your
pa
and
so
i
have
let
clary
go
home
sooner
than
usual
replied
miss
jordan
kissing
her
repeatedly
whilst
the
tears
were
trickling
down
her
cheek
do
cry
teacher
i
love
you
said
the
little
angel
whose
lip
began
to
quiver
in
sympathy
do
cry
i
come
back
again
this
was
too
much
for
the
poor
teacher
who
clasped
the
child
in
her
arms
and
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
uncontrollable
sorrow
at
last
conquering
herself
with
an
effort
she
led
the
children
down
stairs
kissed
them
both
again
and
then
opening
the
door
she
turned
them
forth
into
the
street
turned
away
from
her
school
these
two
little
children
such
as
god
received
into
his
arms
and
blessed
because
they
were
the
children
of
a
chapter
xvi
stevens
makes
a
discovery
well
jule
old
aunt
tabitha
is
gone
at
last
and
i
am
not
at
all
sorry
for
it
i
assure
you
she
been
a
complete
tax
upon
me
for
the
last
eight
years
i
suppose
you
wo
lament
much
nor
yet
go
into
mourning
for
her
continued
stevens
looking
at
her
jocularly
i
not
sorry
that
i
admit
rejoined
stevens
the
poor
old
soul
is
better
off
no
doubt
but
then
there
no
necessity
to
speak
of
the
matter
in
such
an
manner
now
jule
i
beg
you
wo
attempt
to
put
on
the
sanctified
that
too
much
from
you
who
have
been
wishing
her
dead
almost
every
day
for
the
last
eight
years
why
do
you
remember
you
wished
her
gone
when
she
had
a
little
money
to
leave
and
when
she
lost
that
you
wished
her
off
our
hands
because
she
had
none
do
pretend
to
be
in
the
least
depressed
that
wo
do
with
me
well
never
mind
that
said
stevens
a
little
confused
what
has
become
of
her
things
her
clothing
and
furniture
i
ordered
the
furniture
to
be
sold
and
all
there
is
of
it
will
not
realize
sufficient
to
pay
her
funeral
expenses
brixton
wrote
me
that
she
has
left
a
bundle
of
letters
directed
to
me
and
i
desired
him
to
send
them
on
i
wonder
what
they
can
be
said
stevens
some
trash
i
suppose
an
early
love
correspondence
of
but
little
value
to
any
one
but
herself
i
do
not
expect
that
they
will
prove
of
any
consequence
whatever
do
you
think
one
or
the
other
of
us
should
go
to
the
funeral
asked
stevens
nonsense
no
i
have
no
money
to
expend
in
that
way
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
provide
comfortably
for
the
living
without
spending
money
to
follow
the
dead
replied
he
and
besides
i
have
a
case
coming
on
in
the
criminal
court
next
week
that
will
absorb
all
my
attention
what
kind
of
a
case
is
it
she
inquired
a
murder
case
some
irishmen
were
engaged
in
a
row
when
one
of
the
party
received
a
knock
on
his
head
that
proved
too
much
for
him
and
died
in
consequence
my
client
was
one
of
the
contending
parties
and
has
been
suspected
from
some
imprudent
expressions
of
his
to
have
been
the
man
who
struck
the
fatal
blow
his
preliminary
examination
comes
off
or
next
day
and
i
must
be
present
as
a
matter
of
course
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
succeeding
this
conversation
stevens
might
have
been
seen
in
his
dingy
office
seated
at
a
rickety
desk
which
was
covered
with
various
little
bundles
carefully
tied
with
red
tape
the
room
was
gloomy
and
cheerless
and
had
a
mouldy
disagreeable
atmosphere
a
fire
burned
in
the
coal
stove
which
however
seemed
only
to
warm
but
did
not
dry
the
apartment
and
the
windows
were
covered
with
a
thin
coating
of
vapour
stevens
was
busily
engaged
in
writing
when
hearing
footsteps
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
egan
a
friend
of
his
client
entering
the
room
good
morning
egan
said
he
extending
his
hand
how
is
our
friend
mccloskey
this
morning
oh
it
far
down
in
the
mouth
he
is
be
jabers
the
life
scared
out
of
him
tell
him
to
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
not
to
be
frightened
at
trifles
laughingly
remarked
stevens
ca
your
honour
come
and
see
him
asked
egan
i
ca
do
that
but
i
give
you
a
note
to
constable
berry
and
he
will
bring
mccloskey
in
here
as
he
takes
him
to
court
and
stevens
immediately
wrote
the
note
which
egan
received
and
departed
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
hours
mccloskey
was
brought
by
the
accommodating
constable
to
the
office
of
stevens
he
be
safe
with
you
i
suppose
stevens
said
the
constable
but
then
there
is
no
harm
in
seeing
for
one
self
that
all
secure
and
thus
speaking
he
raised
the
window
and
looked
into
the
yard
below
the
height
was
too
great
for
his
prisoner
to
escape
in
that
direction
then
satisfying
himself
that
the
other
door
only
opened
into
a
closet
he
retired
locking
stevens
and
his
client
in
the
room
stevens
arose
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
constable
and
stuffed
a
piece
of
damp
sponge
into
the
keyhole
he
then
returned
and
took
a
seat
by
his
client
now
mccloskey
said
he
in
a
low
tone
as
he
drew
his
chair
closely
in
front
of
the
prisoner
and
fixed
his
keen
grey
eyes
on
him
i
seen
whitticar
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
you
in
a
very
tight
place
prepared
to
swear
that
he
saw
you
with
a
slung
shot
in
your
hand
that
he
saw
you
drop
it
after
the
man
fell
he
picked
it
up
and
whilst
the
man
was
lying
dead
at
his
tavern
awaiting
the
coroner
inquest
he
examined
the
wound
and
saw
in
the
skull
two
little
dents
or
holes
which
were
undoubtedly
made
by
the
little
prongs
that
are
on
the
leaden
ball
of
the
weapon
as
they
correspond
in
depth
and
distance
apart
and
moreover
the
ball
is
attached
to
a
twisted
brace
which
proves
to
be
the
fellow
to
the
one
found
upon
a
pair
of
your
trousers
what
can
you
say
to
all
this
mccloskey
here
gave
a
smothered
groan
and
his
usually
red
face
grew
deadly
pale
in
contemplation
of
his
danger
now
said
stevens
after
waiting
long
enough
for
his
revelation
to
have
its
due
effect
upon
him
there
is
but
one
thing
to
be
done
we
must
buy
whitticar
off
have
you
got
any
money
i
do
mean
fifty
or
a
hundred
dollars
that
would
be
of
no
more
use
than
as
many
pennies
we
must
have
something
of
a
lump
three
or
four
hundred
at
the
very
least
the
prisoner
drew
his
breath
very
hard
at
this
and
remained
silent
come
speak
out
continued
stevens
circumstances
wo
admit
of
our
delaying
this
man
friends
will
raise
heaven
and
earth
to
secure
your
conviction
so
you
see
my
good
fellow
it
your
money
or
your
life
you
can
decide
between
the
two
you
know
which
is
of
the
most
importance
to
you
god
save
us
squire
how
am
i
to
raise
that
much
money
i
have
more
nor
a
hunther
dollars
in
the
world
you
got
a
house
and
a
good
horse
and
dray
replied
stevens
who
was
well
posted
in
the
man
pecuniary
resources
if
you
expect
me
to
get
you
out
of
this
scrape
you
must
sell
or
mortgage
your
house
and
dispose
of
your
horse
and
dray
somehow
or
other
four
hundred
dollars
must
be
raised
or
you
will
be
dangling
at
a
rope
end
in
less
than
six
months
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
go
then
said
mccloskey
reluctantly
then
give
me
authority
continued
stevens
to
arrange
for
the
disposal
of
the
property
and
i
will
have
your
affairs
all
set
straight
in
less
than
no
time
the
constable
here
cut
short
any
further
colloquy
by
rapping
impatiently
on
the
door
then
opening
it
and
exclaiming
come
now
it
is
ten
time
that
you
were
in
court
and
the
two
started
out
followed
by
stevens
after
having
by
some
of
those
mysterious
plans
with
which
lawyers
are
familiar
been
enabled
to
put
off
the
examination
for
a
few
days
stephens
returned
to
his
office
and
found
lying
upon
his
table
the
packet
of
letters
he
was
expecting
from
new
york
upon
breaking
the
seal
and
tearing
off
the
outer
covering
he
discovered
a
number
of
letters
and
yellow
with
age
they
were
tied
tightly
together
with
a
piece
of
cord
cutting
this
they
fell
scattered
over
the
desk
taking
one
of
them
up
he
examined
it
attentively
turning
it
from
side
to
side
to
endeavour
to
decipher
the
what
a
ninny
i
am
to
waste
time
in
looking
at
the
cover
of
this
when
the
contents
will
no
doubt
explain
the
whole
matter
thus
soliloquising
he
opened
the
letter
and
was
soon
deeply
absorbed
in
its
contents
he
perused
and
it
then
opened
one
after
another
the
remainder
that
lay
scattered
before
him
their
contents
seemed
to
agitate
him
exceedingly
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
hasty
strides
muttering
angrily
to
himself
and
occasionally
returning
to
the
desk
to
the
letters
which
had
so
strangely
excited
him
whilst
thus
engaged
the
door
was
opened
by
no
less
a
personage
than
morton
who
walked
in
and
seated
himself
in
a
familiar
manner
oh
how
are
you
morton
you
entered
with
such
a
ghostly
tread
that
i
scarcely
heard
you
said
stevens
with
a
start
what
has
procured
me
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
you
this
morning
i
was
strolling
by
and
thought
i
would
just
step
in
and
inquire
how
that
matter
respecting
the
property
has
succeeded
not
at
all
the
old
fellow
is
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
he
wo
sell
except
on
his
own
terms
which
are
entirely
out
of
all
reason
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
compelled
to
abandon
your
building
speculation
in
that
quarter
until
his
demise
he
is
old
and
feeble
and
ca
last
many
years
in
the
event
of
his
death
you
may
be
able
to
effect
some
more
favourable
arrangement
with
his
heirs
and
perhaps
have
ten
or
fifteen
years
to
wait
no
that
wo
do
better
sell
out
myself
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
stevens
stevens
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
having
opened
the
door
and
looked
into
the
entry
he
closed
it
carefully
placed
the
piece
of
sponge
in
the
and
returned
to
his
seat
at
the
desk
saying
we
transacted
enough
business
together
to
know
one
another
pretty
well
so
i
no
hesitation
in
confiding
to
you
a
little
scheme
i
conceived
for
getting
into
our
hands
a
large
proportion
of
property
in
one
of
the
lower
districts
at
a
very
low
figure
and
is
probable
that
the
same
plan
if
it
answers
will
assist
you
materially
in
carrying
out
your
designs
it
will
require
the
aid
of
two
or
three
moneyed
men
like
yourself
and
if
successful
will
without
doubt
be
highly
remunerative
if
successful
rejoined
morton
yes
there
is
the
rub
how
are
you
to
guarantee
success
hear
my
plan
and
then
you
can
decide
in
the
first
place
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
a
very
strong
feeling
exists
in
the
community
against
the
abolitionists
and
very
properly
too
this
feeling
requires
to
be
guided
into
some
proper
current
and
i
think
we
can
give
it
that
necessary
guidance
and
at
the
same
time
render
it
subservient
to
our
own
purposes
you
are
probably
aware
that
a
large
amount
of
property
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
is
owned
by
niggers
and
if
we
can
create
a
mob
and
direct
it
against
them
they
will
be
glad
to
leave
that
quarter
and
remove
further
up
into
the
city
for
security
and
protection
once
get
the
mob
thoroughly
aroused
and
have
the
leaders
under
our
control
and
we
may
direct
its
energies
against
any
parties
we
desire
and
we
can
render
the
district
so
unsafe
that
property
will
be
greatly
lessened
in
value
the
houses
will
rent
poorly
and
many
proprietors
will
be
happy
to
sell
at
very
reduced
prices
if
you
can
furnish
me
the
means
to
start
with
i
have
men
enough
at
my
command
to
effect
the
rest
we
will
so
control
the
elections
in
the
district
through
these
men
as
to
place
in
office
only
such
persons
as
will
wink
at
the
disturbances
when
through
their
agency
we
have
brought
property
down
sufficiently
low
we
will
purchase
all
that
we
can
order
and
quiet
and
sell
again
at
an
immense
advantage
your
scheme
is
a
good
one
i
must
confess
and
i
am
ready
to
join
you
at
any
time
i
will
communicate
with
carson
who
i
think
will
be
interested
as
he
desired
to
invest
with
me
in
those
improvements
i
will
call
in
and
endeavour
to
persuade
him
to
accompany
me
and
then
we
can
discuss
the
matter
more
fully
well
do
but
one
word
before
you
go
you
appear
to
know
everybody
who
is
anybody
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
can
you
give
me
any
information
respecting
a
family
by
the
name
of
garie
who
live
or
formerly
did
live
in
the
vicinity
of
savannah
oh
yes
i
know
them
root
and
branch
although
there
is
but
little
of
the
latter
left
they
are
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
georgia
those
of
whom
i
have
heard
the
most
are
of
the
last
two
generations
there
now
remain
of
the
family
but
two
persons
old
john
or
jack
garie
as
he
is
called
a
bachelor
and
who
i
have
recently
learned
is
at
the
point
of
death
and
a
nephew
of
his
living
in
this
city
said
to
be
married
to
a
nigger
woman
actually
married
to
her
blackly
informed
me
last
week
that
he
sent
for
him
to
perform
the
ceremony
which
he
very
properly
refused
to
do
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
he
has
been
successful
in
procuring
the
services
of
some
one
else
i
am
sorry
to
say
there
are
some
clergymen
in
our
city
who
would
willingly
assist
in
such
a
disgraceful
proceeding
what
ever
could
have
induced
a
man
with
his
prospects
to
throw
himself
away
in
that
manner
i
am
at
loss
to
determine
he
has
an
independent
fortune
of
about
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
besides
expectations
from
his
uncle
who
is
worth
a
considerable
sum
of
money
i
suppose
these
little
darkies
of
his
will
inherit
it
concluded
morton
are
there
no
other
heirs
asked
stevens
in
a
tone
of
deep
interest
there
may
be
he
had
an
aunt
who
married
an
exceedingly
low
fellow
from
the
north
who
treated
her
shamefully
the
mercenary
scoundrel
no
doubt
expected
to
have
acquired
a
fortune
with
her
as
it
was
generally
understood
that
she
was
sole
heiress
of
her
mother
property
but
it
turned
out
to
be
an
entire
mistake
the
circumstance
made
considerable
stir
at
the
time
i
remember
having
heard
my
elders
discuss
it
some
years
after
its
occurrence
but
why
do
you
take
such
an
interest
in
it
you
charged
me
with
coming
upon
you
like
a
ghost
i
could
return
the
compliment
why
man
you
look
like
a
sheet
what
ails
you
me
i
oh
nothing
nothing
perfectly
well
that
is
to
say
i
was
up
rather
late
last
night
and
am
rather
fatigued
to
day
nothing
more
you
looked
so
strange
that
i
could
not
help
being
frightened
and
you
seemed
so
interested
you
must
have
some
personal
motive
for
inquiring
no
more
than
a
lawyer
often
has
in
the
business
of
his
clients
i
have
been
commissioned
to
obtain
some
information
respecting
these
people
a
mere
matter
of
business
nothing
more
believe
me
call
in
again
soon
and
endeavour
to
bring
carson
but
pray
be
discreet
be
very
careful
to
whom
you
mention
the
matter
never
fear
said
morton
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
sauntered
lazily
out
of
the
house
morton
speculated
in
stocks
and
in
the
same
spirit
that
he
had
formerly
betted
at
the
racecourse
and
cockpit
in
his
dear
palmetto
state
it
was
a
pleasant
sort
of
excitement
to
him
and
without
excitement
of
some
kind
he
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
exist
to
have
frequented
gaming
hells
and
race
courses
in
the
north
would
have
greatly
impaired
his
social
position
and
as
he
set
a
high
value
upon
that
he
was
compelled
to
forego
his
favourite
pursuits
and
associate
himself
with
a
set
of
men
who
conducted
a
system
of
gambling
operations
upon
of
a
less
questionable
but
equally
exciting
character
stevens
sat
musing
at
his
desk
for
some
time
after
the
departure
of
his
visitor
then
taking
up
one
of
the
letters
that
had
so
strongly
excited
him
he
read
and
it
then
crushing
it
in
his
hand
arose
stamped
his
feet
and
exclaimed
i
have
it
if
i
here
he
stopped
short
and
looking
round
caught
a
view
of
his
face
in
the
glass
he
sank
back
into
the
chair
behind
him
horrified
at
the
lividness
of
his
countenance
good
god
he
soliloquized
i
look
like
a
murderer
already
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
turned
away
from
the
glass
but
i
am
wrong
to
be
excited
thus
men
who
accomplish
great
things
approach
them
coolly
so
must
i
must
plot
watch
and
wait
and
thus
speaking
he
put
on
his
hat
and
left
the
office
as
stevens
approached
his
house
a
handsome
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
of
his
neighbour
and
garie
and
his
wife
who
had
been
enjoying
a
drive
along
the
bank
of
the
river
alighted
and
entered
their
residence
the
rustle
of
her
rich
silk
dress
grated
harshly
on
his
ear
and
the
soft
perfume
that
wafted
toward
him
as
she
glided
by
was
the
very
reverse
of
pleasant
to
him
garie
bowed
stiffly
to
him
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
of
their
respective
residences
which
were
only
divided
by
the
low
iron
fence
but
beyond
the
slight
inclination
of
the
head
took
no
further
notice
of
him
the
cursed
haughty
brute
muttered
stevens
as
he
jerked
the
bell
with
violence
how
i
hate
him
i
hated
him
before
i
knew
but
now
i
as
he
spoke
the
door
was
opened
by
a
little
servant
that
stevens
had
recently
obtained
from
a
charity
institution
you
kept
me
standing
a
pretty
time
exclaimed
he
savagely
as
he
seized
her
ear
and
gave
it
a
spiteful
twist
ca
you
manage
to
open
the
door
quicker
i
was
up
in
the
garret
and
did
hear
the
bell
she
replied
timidly
then
i
improve
your
hearing
he
continued
malignantly
as
he
pulled
her
by
the
ear
take
that
now
and
see
if
you
keep
me
standing
at
the
door
an
hour
again
striding
forward
into
the
back
parlour
he
found
his
wife
holding
a
small
rattan
elevated
over
little
lizzy
in
a
threatening
attitude
will
you
never
mind
me
i
told
you
again
and
again
not
to
go
and
still
you
persist
in
disobeying
me
i
cut
you
to
pieces
if
you
do
mind
will
you
ever
go
again
she
almost
screamed
in
the
ears
of
the
terrified
child
oh
no
mother
never
please
do
whip
me
i
mind
you
and
as
she
spoke
she
shrank
as
far
as
possible
into
the
corner
of
the
room
all
this
what
the
matter
jule
what
on
earth
are
you
going
to
whip
liz
for
because
she
deserves
it
was
the
sharp
reply
she
do
mind
a
word
i
say
i
forbid
her
again
and
again
to
go
next
door
to
visit
those
little
niggers
and
she
will
do
it
in
spite
of
me
she
slipped
off
this
afternoon
and
has
been
in
their
house
over
an
hour
and
it
was
only
this
morning
i
detected
her
kissing
their
clarence
through
the
fence
faugh
said
stevens
with
a
look
of
disgust
you
kissed
a
nigger
i
ashamed
of
you
you
nasty
little
thing
your
mother
ought
to
have
taken
a
and
cleaned
your
mouth
never
do
such
a
thing
again
come
here
to
me
as
he
spoke
he
extended
his
hand
and
grasped
the
delicately
rounded
arm
of
his
little
girl
what
induces
you
to
go
amongst
those
people
has
your
mother
again
and
again
forbidden
you
to
do
so
why
do
you
go
i
say
he
continued
shaking
her
roughly
by
the
arm
and
frowning
savagely
why
do
you
answer
speak
the
child
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
lovely
face
was
only
able
to
answer
in
her
defence
oh
pa
i
do
love
them
so
you
do
do
you
replied
her
exasperated
father
stamping
his
foot
and
pushing
her
from
him
go
to
bed
and
if
ever
i
hear
of
you
going
there
again
you
shall
be
well
whipped
the
tearful
face
lingered
about
the
door
in
hope
of
a
reprieve
that
did
not
come
and
then
disappeared
for
the
night
the
children
must
not
be
suffered
to
go
in
there
jule
something
learned
will
here
stevens
checked
himself
and
in
answer
to
his
wife
impatient
what
have
you
learned
replied
oh
nothing
of
consequence
nothing
that
will
interest
you
and
sat
with
his
slipper
in
his
hand
engaged
in
deep
thought
now
for
stevens
to
commence
a
communication
to
his
wife
and
then
break
off
in
the
middle
of
it
was
as
novel
as
disagreeable
as
he
was
generally
very
communicative
and
would
detail
to
her
in
the
evening
with
pleasing
minuteness
all
the
rogueries
he
had
accomplished
during
the
day
and
his
unwillingness
to
confide
something
that
evidently
occupied
his
mind
caused
his
spouse
to
be
greatly
irritated
stevens
drank
his
tea
in
silence
and
during
the
evening
continued
absorbed
in
reflection
and
notwithstanding
the
various
remarks
of
his
wife
upon
his
strange
conduct
retired
without
giving
her
the
slightest
clue
to
its
cause
chapter
xvii
plotting
stevens
awoke
at
a
very
early
hour
the
ensuing
morning
and
quite
unceremoniously
shook
his
wife
to
arouse
her
also
this
he
accomplished
after
considerable
labour
for
stevens
was
much
more
sleepy
than
usual
in
consequence
of
her
husband
restlessness
the
previous
night
i
declare
said
she
rubbing
her
eyes
i
do
get
any
peace
of
my
life
you
lie
awake
kicking
about
half
the
night
muttering
and
whispering
about
no
one
knows
what
and
then
want
me
to
rise
before
day
what
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
for
this
morning
no
more
mysteries
i
hope
oh
come
jule
get
up
said
her
husband
impatiently
i
must
be
off
to
my
business
very
early
i
am
overburthened
with
different
things
this
morning
stevens
made
a
very
hasty
toilette
and
descended
to
the
kitchen
where
the
little
was
bustling
about
with
her
eyes
only
half
open
with
her
assistance
the
breakfast
was
soon
prepared
and
stevens
called
downstairs
he
ate
rapidly
and
silently
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
meal
put
on
his
hat
and
wished
his
amiable
spouse
an
abrupt
good
morning
after
leaving
his
house
he
did
not
take
the
usual
course
to
his
office
but
turned
his
steps
toward
the
lower
part
of
the
city
hastening
onward
he
soon
left
the
improved
parts
of
it
in
his
rear
and
entered
upon
a
shabby
district
the
morning
was
very
chilly
and
as
it
was
yet
quite
early
but
few
people
were
stirring
they
were
labourers
hurrying
to
their
work
milkmen
and
trundlers
of
breadcarts
at
length
he
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
tavern
over
which
was
a
large
sign
bearing
the
name
of
whitticar
on
entering
he
found
two
or
three
wretches
clustering
round
the
stove
endeavouring
to
receive
some
warmth
upon
their
bodies
their
red
and
pimpled
noses
being
the
only
parts
about
them
that
did
not
look
cold
they
stared
wonderingly
at
stevens
as
he
entered
for
a
person
so
respectable
as
himself
in
appearance
was
but
seldom
seen
in
that
house
the
boy
who
attended
the
bar
inquired
from
behind
the
counter
what
he
would
take
whitticar
if
you
please
blandly
replied
stevens
hearing
this
the
boy
bolted
from
the
shop
and
quite
alarmed
the
family
by
stating
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
shop
who
said
he
wanted
to
take
whitticar
and
he
suspected
that
he
was
a
policeman
whitticar
who
was
seldom
entirely
free
from
some
scrape
went
through
another
door
to
take
a
survey
of
the
new
comer
and
on
ascertaining
who
it
was
entered
the
room
you
quite
upset
the
family
we
all
took
you
for
a
constable
said
he
approaching
stevens
who
shook
hands
with
him
heartily
and
then
laying
his
arm
familiarly
on
his
shoulder
rejoined
i
say
whitticar
i
want
about
five
minutes
conversation
with
you
have
you
some
room
where
we
can
be
quite
private
for
a
little
while
yes
come
this
way
replied
he
and
leading
his
visitor
through
the
bar
they
entered
a
small
back
room
the
door
of
which
they
locked
behind
them
now
whitticar
said
stevens
i
want
you
to
act
the
part
of
a
friend
by
the
fellow
who
got
in
that
awkward
scrape
at
this
house
as
you
did
not
give
the
evidence
you
informed
me
you
were
possessed
of
at
the
inquest
it
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
do
so
before
the
magistrate
at
examination
there
is
no
use
in
hanging
the
fellow
it
can
not
result
in
any
benefit
to
yourself
it
will
only
attract
disagreeable
notice
to
your
establishment
and
possibly
may
occasion
a
loss
of
your
licence
we
will
be
willing
to
make
it
worth
your
while
to
absent
yourself
for
a
short
time
at
least
until
the
trial
is
over
it
will
put
money
in
your
purse
and
save
this
poor
devil
life
besides
what
do
you
say
to
receiving
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
going
off
for
a
month
or
two
could
think
of
it
stevens
no
how
see
how
my
business
would
suffer
everything
would
be
at
loose
ends
i
should
be
obliged
to
hire
a
man
to
take
my
place
and
in
that
case
i
must
calculate
upon
his
stealing
at
least
per
cent
of
the
receipts
and
then
there
is
his
wages
no
no
that
wo
do
besides
i
trying
to
obtain
the
nomination
for
the
office
of
alderman
to
secure
it
i
must
be
on
the
spot
nothing
like
looking
out
for
oneself
i
am
afraid
i
ca
accommodate
you
squire
unless
you
can
offer
something
better
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
you
got
no
conscience
rejoined
stevens
not
a
bit
well
the
less
of
that
the
better
for
me
it
a
thing
of
very
little
use
in
the
business
it
interferes
with
trade
so
i
ca
afford
to
keep
a
conscience
if
you
really
want
me
to
go
make
me
a
better
offer
say
two
fifty
and
i
begin
to
think
of
it
the
trial
will
be
over
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
i
suppose
and
a
spree
of
that
length
would
be
very
pleasant
no
i
wo
do
that
whitticar
that
flat
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
make
it
two
hundred
and
what
is
more
i
see
to
your
nomination
i
all
right
down
here
you
know
i
own
the
boys
in
this
district
and
if
you
say
you
put
some
little
matters
through
for
me
after
you
are
elected
i
call
it
a
bargain
then
i
your
man
said
whitticar
extending
his
hand
well
then
added
stevens
come
to
my
office
this
morning
and
you
shall
have
the
money
after
that
i
shall
expect
you
to
get
out
of
town
as
quick
as
possible
goodbye
so
far
all
right
muttered
stevens
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
as
he
left
the
house
he
be
of
great
use
to
me
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
blind
the
public
by
a
sham
investigation
he
will
be
the
man
to
conduct
it
when
i
want
a
man
released
from
prison
or
a
little
job
of
that
kind
done
he
will
do
it
this
act
will
put
him
in
my
power
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
he
wo
prove
of
the
utmost
service
in
our
riot
scheme
now
then
we
will
have
an
examination
of
mccloskey
as
soon
as
they
like
a
few
weeks
subsequent
to
the
events
we
have
just
written
we
find
stevens
seated
in
his
dingy
office
in
company
with
the
mccloskey
who
had
recently
been
discharged
from
custody
in
default
of
sufficient
evidence
being
found
to
warrant
his
committal
for
trial
he
was
sitting
with
his
feet
upon
the
stove
and
was
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
most
manner
imaginable
so
far
so
good
said
stevens
as
he
laid
down
the
letter
he
was
perusing
that
simplifies
the
matter
greatly
and
whatever
is
to
be
done
towards
his
removal
must
be
done
quickly
now
that
the
old
man
is
dead
there
is
but
one
to
deal
with
during
the
interval
that
had
elapsed
between
the
interview
of
stevens
with
whitticar
and
the
period
to
which
we
now
refer
stevens
had
been
actively
engaged
in
promoting
his
riot
scheme
and
already
several
disturbances
had
occurred
in
which
a
number
of
inoffensive
coloured
people
had
been
injured
in
their
persons
and
property
but
this
was
only
a
faint
indication
of
what
was
to
follow
and
as
he
had
through
the
agency
of
morton
and
others
been
able
to
prevent
any
but
the
most
garbled
statements
of
these
affairs
from
getting
abroad
there
was
but
little
danger
of
their
operations
being
interfered
with
leading
articles
daily
appeared
in
the
public
journals
particularly
those
that
circulated
amongst
the
lowest
classes
in
which
the
negroes
were
denounced
in
the
strongest
terms
it
was
averred
that
their
insolence
since
the
commencement
of
the
abolition
agitation
had
become
unbearable
and
from
many
quarters
was
suggested
the
absolute
necessity
for
inflicting
some
general
chastisement
to
convince
them
that
they
were
still
negroes
and
to
teach
them
to
remain
in
their
proper
place
in
the
body
politic
many
of
these
articles
were
written
by
stevens
and
their
insertion
as
editorials
procured
through
the
instrumentality
of
morton
and
his
friends
stevens
turned
to
his
visitor
and
inquired
what
was
done
last
night
much
of
anything
a
great
deal
yer
honour
replied
mccloskey
a
nagur
or
two
half
killed
and
one
house
set
on
fire
and
nearly
burned
up
that
said
stevens
with
a
look
of
disappointment
is
that
all
why
you
are
a
miserable
set
you
should
have
beaten
every
darky
out
of
the
district
by
this
time
they
not
so
aisily
bate
out
they
fight
like
sevin
divils
one
o
night
before
last
split
mikey
dolan
head
clane
open
and
it
a
small
chance
of
his
life
he
got
to
comfort
himself
wid
chances
of
war
chances
of
war
rejoined
stevens
mere
trifles
when
you
get
used
to
you
must
let
that
stop
you
you
have
a
great
deal
yet
to
do
what
you
have
already
accomplished
is
a
very
small
matter
compared
with
what
is
expected
and
what
i
intend
you
to
do
your
work
has
only
just
begun
man
jist
begun
replied
the
astonished
mccloskey
have
we
bin
raising
the
very
divil
every
night
for
the
last
week
running
a
near
chance
of
being
kilt
all
the
time
and
all
for
nothing
it
gettin
tiresome
one
like
to
be
fighting
the
nagurs
all
the
time
for
the
mere
fun
of
the
thing
it
do
pay
for
divil
a
cent
have
i
got
for
all
my
trouble
and
ye
said
ye
would
pay
well
ye
remimber
so
i
shall
said
stevens
when
you
do
something
worth
paying
for
the
quarter
is
not
accomplished
yet
i
want
the
place
made
so
hot
down
there
that
the
niggers
ca
stay

do
give
them
any
rest
i
protect
you
from
the
consequences
whatever
they
be
i
great
things
in
store
for
you
continued
he
moving
nearer
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
tone
how
should
you
like
to
return
to
ireland
a
moneyed
man
i
should
like
it
well
enough
to
be
sure
but
where

squire
oh

enough
to
be
had
if
you
have
the
courage
to

it
i
willin
enough
to
earn
an
honest
penny
but
i
do
like
risking
me

for
it
squire
it
clear
ye
not
be
afther

me
a
dale
of
money
widout
being
sure
of

the
worth
of
it
out

and
it
dirty
work
enough
i
done
widout
the
doin
of
any
more

a
sore
throuble
to
me
about

out
o
that
and
divil
a
like
scrape
will
i
get
in
agin
wid
my
own
consint
your
conscience
has
become
troublesome
very
suddenly
rejoined
stevens
with
a
look
of
angry
scorn
it
strange
it
do
appear
to
have
troubled
you
in
the
least
during
the
last
few
weeks
whilst
you
have
been
knocking
niggers
on
the
head
so
freely
well
i
tired
o
that
work
interrupted
mccloskey
and
what
more
i
soon
be
lavin
of
it
off
we
see
about
that
said
stevens
you
a
pretty
fellow
now
ai
you
grateful
too
very
here
i
been
successful
in
getting
you
out
of
a
hanging
scrape
and
require
a
trifling
service
in
return
and
you
retire
you
find
this
trifling
wo
do
with
me
continued
stevens
with
great
sternness
of
manner
you
shall
do
as
i
wish
you
are
in
my
power
i
need
your
services
and
i
will
have
them
make
up
your
mind
to
that
mccloskey
was
somewhat
staggered
at
this
bold
declaration
from
stevens
but
he
soon
assumed
his
former
assured
manner
and
replied
i
like
to
know
how
i
in
your
power
as
far
as
this
riot
business
is
concerned
you
as
deep
in
the
mud
as
i
in
the
mire
as
for
the
other
be
patrick
i
clane
out
o
that
they
do
try
a
man
twice
for
the
same
thing
do
halloo
so
loud
my
fine
fellow
sneeringly
rejoined
stevens
you
are
not
entirely
out
of
the
wood
yet
you
are
by
no
means
as
safe
as
you
imagine
you
have
been
yet
you
have
only
been
examined
before
a
magistrate
they
lacked
sufficient
evidence
to
commit
you
for
trial
that
evidence
i
can
produce
at
any
time
so
remember
if
you
please
you
have
not
been
tried
yet
when
you
have
been
and
acquitted
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
know
will
you
stevens
stood
for
a
few
moments
silently
regarding
the
change
his
language
had
brought
over
the
now
crestfallen
mccloskey
he
then
continued
do
think
you
can
escape
me
i
have
a
thousand
eyes
upon
you
no
one
ever
escapes
me
that
i
wish
to
retain
do
as
i
require
and
i
promote
your
interest
in
every
possible
way
and
protect
you
but
waver
or
hold
back
and
i
hang
you
as
unhesitatingly
as
if
you
were
a
dog
this
threat
was
given
in
a
tone
that
left
no
doubt
on
the
mind
of
the
hearer
but
that
stevens
would
carry
out
his
expressed
intention
and
the
reflections
thereby
engendered
by
no
means
added
to
the
comfort
or
sense
of
security
that
mccloskey
had
flattered
himself
he
was
in
future
to
enjoy
he
therefore
began
to
discover
the
bad
policy
of
offending
one
who
might
prove
so
formidable
an
enemy
of
incensing
one
who
had
it
in
his
power
to
retaliate
by
such
terrible
measures
he
therefore
turned
to
stevens
with
a
somewhat
humbled
manner
and
said
you
need
get
so
mad
squire
sure
it
but
natural
that
a
man
should
want
to
get
any
deeper
in
the
mire
than
he
can
help
and
enough
on
my
hands
now
to
make
them
too
red
to
look
at
wid
comfort
sure
it
not
a
shade
deeper
you
have
he
asked
looking
inquiringly
at
stevens
who
was
compelled
to
turn
away
his
face
for
a
moment
to
hide
his
agitation
at
last
he
mastered
his
countenance
and
in
as
cool
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
replied
oh
a
little
more
on
them
will
be
scarcely
a
perceptible
addition
you
know
the
old
adage
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
you
need
have
no
fear
said
he
lowering
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
it
can
be
done
in
a
crowd
and
at
night
no
one
will
notice
it
i
do
know
about
that
squire
in
a
crowd
some
one
will
be
sure
to
notice
it
it
too
dangerous
i
ca
do
it
tut
tut
man
do
talk
like
a
fool
i
tell
you
there
is
no
danger
you
in
company
with
a
mob
of
others
are
to
attack
this
man
house
when
he
makes
his
appearance
as
he
will
be
sure
to
do
shoot
him
down
good
god
squire
said
mccloskey
his
face
growing
pale
at
the
prospect
of
what
was
required
of
him
you
talk
of
murder
as
if
it
was
mere
play
and
still
never
murdered
any
rejoined
stevens
significantly
come
come
put
your
scruples
in
your
pocket
and
make
up
your
mind
to
go
through
with
it
like
a
man
when
the
thing
is
done
you
shall
have
five
thousand
dollars
in
hard
cash
and
you
can
go
with
it
where
you
please
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
ah
squire
the
money
a
great
timptation
but
it
an
awful
job
no
worse
than
you
did
for
nothing
replied
stevens
but
that
was
in
a
fair
fight
and
in
hot
blood
it
is
like
planning
to
kill
a
man
squire
do
you
call
it
a
fair
fight
when
you
steal
up
behind
a
man
and
break
his
skull
with
a
slung
shot
asked
stevens
mccloskey
was
unable
to
answer
this
and
sat
moodily
regarding
his
tempter
come
make
up
your
mind
to
it
you
might
as
well
resumed
stevens
in
a
coaxing
tone
ye
seem
bent
on
not
giving
it
up
and
i
suppose
i
have
to
do
it
replied
mccloskey
reluctantly
but
what
has
the
man
done
to
ye
squire
that
you
so
down
upon
him
oh
he
is
one
of
those
infernal
abolitionists
and
one
of
the
very
worst
kind
he
lives
with
a
nigger
woman
and
what
is
more
he
is
married
to
her
married
to
a
nigger
exclaimed
mccloskey
it
a
quare
taste
the
animal
has
but
you
not
afther
killing
him
for
that
there
something
more
behind
it
not
for
having
a
black
wife
instead
of
a
white
one
you
be
afther
murthering
him
ye
get
no
stuff
like
that
down
me
no
it
is
not
for
that
alone
i
acknowledge
rejoined
stevens
with
considerable
embarrassment
he
insulted
me
some
time
ago
and
i
want
to
be
revenged
upon
him
it
a
dear
job
to
insult
you
at
that
rate
squire
but
where
does
he
live
in
my
neighbourhood
in
fact
next
door
to
me
replied
stevens
with
an
averted
face
howly
mother
not
away
up
there
sure
it
crazy
ye
are
what
away
up
there
in
the
city
limits
why
they
would
have
the
police
and
the
sogers
at
our
heels
in
less
than
no
time
sure
you
out
o
your
sinses
to
have
me
go
up
there
with
a
mob
no
no
there
too
much
risk
i
ca
try
that
i
tell
you
there
shall
be
no
risk
impatiently
replied
stevens
not
to
be
done
nor
night
and
when
i
say
do
it
you
do
it
and
as
safely
there
as
anywhere
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
thing
be
done
and
it
is
half
finished
already
you
have
only
to
make
up
your
mind
that
you
will
accomplish
a
design
in
spite
of
obstacles
and
what
you
once
thought
to
be
insurmountable
difficulties
will
prove
mere
straws
in
your
path
but
we
are
wasting
time
i
determined
you
shall
do
it
and
i
hope
you
now
know
me
well
enough
to
be
convinced
that
it
is
your
best
policy
to
be
as
obliging
as
possible
you
had
better
go
now
and
be
prepared
to
meet
me
at
whitticar
after
the
door
closed
upon
the
retreating
form
of
mccloskey
the
careless
expression
that
stevens
countenance
had
worn
during
the
conversation
gave
place
to
one
full
of
anxiety
and
apprehension
and
he
shuddered
as
he
contemplated
the
fearful
length
to
which
he
was
proceeding
if
i
fail
said
he
pshaw
i
not
fail
i
must
not
fail
for
failure
is
worse
than
ruin
but
cool
cool
he
continued
sitting
down
to
his
desk
those
who
work
nervously
do
nothing
right
he
sat
writing
uninterruptedly
until
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
fading
sunlight
compelled
him
to
relinquish
his
pen
and
prepare
for
home
thrusting
the
papers
into
his
pocket
he
hurried
toward
the
newspaper
office
from
which
were
to
emanate
as
editorials
the
carefully
concocted
appeals
to
the
passions
of
the
rabble
which
he
had
been
all
the
afternoon
so
busily
engaged
in
preparing
chapter
xviii
stevens
falls
into
bad
hands
the
amiable
partner
of
stevens
sat
in
high
dudgeon
at
being
so
long
restrained
from
her
favourite
beverage
by
the
unusually
deferred
absence
of
her
husband
at
length
she
was
rejoiced
by
hearing
his
step
as
he
came
through
the
garden
and
the
rattle
of
his
as
he
opened
the
door
was
quite
musical
in
her
ears
i
thought
you
was
never
coming
said
she
querulously
as
he
entered
the
room
i
have
been
waiting
tea
until
i
am
almost
starved
you
need
have
waited
a
moment
for
you
will
be
obliged
to
eat
alone
after
all
i
going
out
pour
me
out
a
cup
of
tea
i
drink
it
whilst
i
dressing
and
continued
stevens
i
want
you
to
get
me
that
old
brown
and
those
striped
trowsers
i
used
to
wear
occasionally
why
you
told
me
rejoined
stevens
that
you
did
not
require
them
again
and
so
i
exchanged
them
for
this
pair
of
vases
the
devil
you
did
said
stevens
angrily
you
let
them
lie
about
the
house
for
nearly
a
year
and
now
just
as
they
were
likely
to
be
of
some
service
to
me
you
sold
them
it
just
like
you
always
doing
something
at
the
wrong
time
how
on
earth
stevens
was
i
to
know
you
wanted
them
well
there
jule
they
gone
do
let
have
any
more
talk
about
it
get
me
another
cup
of
tea
i
must
go
out
immediately
after
hastily
swallowing
the
second
cup
stevens
left
his
home
and
walked
to
an
from
whence
he
was
quickly
transported
to
a
street
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
in
which
were
a
number
of
clothing
stores
these
places
were
supported
principally
by
the
country
people
who
attended
the
market
in
the
same
street
and
who
fancied
that
the
clothing
they
purchased
at
these
shops
must
be
cheap
because
it
was
at
stevens
stopped
at
the
door
of
one
of
these
establishments
and
paused
to
take
a
slight
survey
of
the
premises
before
entering
the
doorway
was
hung
with
coats
of
every
fashion
of
the
last
twenty
years
and
all
in
various
stages
of
decay
some
of
them
looked
quite
respectable
from
much
cleaning
and
patching
and
others
presented
a
reckless
and
forlorn
aspect
as
their
worn
and
ragged
sleeves
swung
about
in
the
evening
air
old
hats
some
of
which
were
in
all
probability
worn
at
a
period
anterior
to
the
revolution
kept
company
with
the
shoes
that
were
ranged
on
shelves
beside
the
doorway
where
they
served
in
the
capacity
of
signs
and
fairly
indicated
the
style
of
goods
to
be
purchased
within
seeing
that
there
were
no
buyers
in
the
store
stevens
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
sounds
of
his
footsteps
drew
from
behind
the
counter
no
less
a
personage
than
our
redoubtable
friend
kinch
who
in
the
absence
of
his
father
was
presiding
over
the
establishment
well
snowball
said
stevens
do
you
keep
this
my
name
is
not
snowball
and
this
ai
a
replied
kinch
do
you
want
to
buy
anything
i
believe
i
do
answered
stevens
let
me
look
at
some
coats
one
that
i
can
get
on
i
wo
say
fit
me
i
indifferent
about
that
let
me
see
some
of
the
worst
you
got
kinch
looked
surprised
at
this
request
from
a
gentleman
of
appearance
and
handed
out
quite
mechanically
a
coat
that
was
but
slightly
worn
oh
that
wo
do
i
want
something
like
this
said
stevens
taking
down
from
a
peg
a
very
dilapidated
coat
of
drab
colour
and
peculiar
cut
what
do
you
ask
for
this
that
not
fit
for
a
gentleman
like
you
sir
said
kinch
i
the
best
judge
of
that
matter
rejoined
stevens
what
is
the
price
of
it
oh
that
coat
you
can
have
for
a
dollar
replied
kinch
then
i
take
it
now
hand
out
some
trowsers
the
trowsers
were
brought
and
from
a
large
number
stevens
selected
a
pair
that
suited
him
then
adding
an
old
hat
to
his
list
of
purchases
he
declared
his
complete
ca
you
accommodate
me
with
some
place
where
i
can
put
these
on
he
asked
of
kinch
i
going
to
have
a
little
sport
with
some
friends
of
mine
and
i
want
to
wear
them
kinch
led
the
way
into
a
back
room
where
he
assisted
stevens
to
array
himself
in
his
garments
by
the
change
in
his
attire
he
seemed
completely
robbed
of
all
appearance
of
respectability
the
most
disagreeable
points
of
his
physique
seemed
to
be
brought
more
prominently
forward
by
the
habiliments
he
had
assumed
they
being
quite
in
harmony
with
his
villanous
countenance
kinch
who
looked
at
him
with
wonder
was
forced
to
remark
why
you
look
a
bit
like
a
gentleman
now
sir
stevens
stepped
forward
and
surveyed
himself
in
the
the
transformation
was
complete
surprising
even
to
himself
i
never
knew
before
said
he
mentally
how
far
a
suit
of
clothes
goes
towards
giving
one
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
he
now
emptied
the
pockets
of
the
suit
he
had
on
in
so
doing
he
dropped
upon
the
floor
without
observing
it
one
of
the
papers
fold
these
up
said
he
handing
to
kinch
the
suit
he
had
just
taken
off
and
bring
them
to
this
address
as
he
spoke
he
laid
his
card
upon
the
counter
and
after
paying
for
his
new
purchases
walked
out
of
the
shop
and
bent
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
whitticar
tavern
on
arriving
there
he
found
the
crowded
with
men
the
majority
of
whom
were
irishmen
armed
with
bludgeons
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
his
appearance
amongst
them
excited
but
little
attention
and
he
remained
there
some
time
before
he
was
recognized
by
the
master
of
the
establishment
by
the
howly
patherick
i
did
know
you
squire
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
hist
cried
stevens
putting
his
fingers
to
his
lips
i
thought
it
was
best
to
see
how
matters
were
progressing
so
i
run
down
for
a
little
while
how
are
you
getting
on
fine
fine
squire
replied
whitticar
the
boys
are
ripe
for
anything
they
talk
of
burning
down
a
nigger
church
not
they
must
not
do
such
a
thing
we
are
not
ready
for
that
yet
i
made
out
a
little
list
some
of
the
places
on
it
they
might
have
a
dash
at
just
to
keep
their
hands
in
as
stevens
spoke
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
the
list
in
question
and
was
quite
surprised
to
be
unable
to
discover
it
ca
you
find
it
squire
asked
whitticar
i
must
have
lost
it
on
the
way
replied
stevens
i
am
sure
i
put
it
in
this
pocket
and
he
made
another
search
no
use
i
have
to
give
it
up
said
he
at
length
but
where
is
mccloskey
i
have
seen
him
since
i
came
in
he
came
here
this
afternoon
very
far
gone
he
had
been
crooking
his
elbow
pretty
frequently
and
was
so
very
drunk
that
i
advised
him
to
go
home
and
go
to
bed
so
he
took
another
dram
and
went
away
and
i
have
seen
him
since
that
bad
very
bad
everything
goes
wrong
this
evening
i
wanted
him
particularly
would
the
boys
go
out
with
you
suggested
whitticar
no
no
that
would
do
at
all
i
must
appear
in
these
things
if
hauled
up
for
participation
who
is
to
be
your
lawyer
eh
true
for
you
rejoined
whitticar
and
i
just
disperse
the
crowd
as
soon
as
i
can
and
there
will
be
one
peaceable
night
in
the
district
at
any
rate
not
liking
to
give
directions
to
the
mob
personally
and
his
useful
coadjutor
mccloskey
not
being
at
hand
stevens
came
to
the
conclusion
he
would
return
to
his
home
and
on
the
next
evening
a
descent
should
be
made
upon
the
places
marked
on
the
list
taking
out
his
watch
he
found
it
would
be
too
late
to
return
to
the
store
where
he
had
purchased
his
present
adornments
so
he
determined
to
start
for
home
the
coat
that
temporarily
adorned
the
person
of
stevens
was
of
peculiar
cut
and
colour
it
was
in
fact
rather
in
the
rowdy
style
and
had
in
its
pristine
state
bedecked
the
person
of
a
member
of
a
notorious
fire
company
these
gentry
had
for
a
long
time
been
the
terror
of
the
district
in
which
they
roamed
and
had
rendered
themselves
highly
obnoxious
to
some
of
the
rival
factions
on
the
borders
of
their
own
territory
they
had
the
unpleasant
habit
of
pitching
into
and
maltreating
without
the
slightest
provocation
any
one
whom
their
practised
eyes
discovered
to
be
a
rival
and
by
such
outrages
they
had
excited
in
the
bosoms
of
their
victims
a
desire
for
revenge
that
only
awaited
the
occasion
to
manifest
itself
stevens
in
happy
unconsciousness
that
owing
to
his
habiliments
he
represented
one
of
the
and
hated
faction
walked
on
quite
leisurely
but
unfortunately
for
him
his
way
home
lay
directly
through
the
camp
of
their
bitterest
and
most
active
enemies
standing
in
front
of
a
through
which
a
bright
light
shone
were
a
group
of
young
men
who
bestowed
upon
stevens
more
than
passing
attention
i
blest
exclaimed
one
of
them
if
there
ai
a
ranger
now
that
it
a
saucy
piece
of
business
ai
it
that
fellow
has
come
up
here
to
be
able
to
go
back
and
play
let
wallop
him
then
suggested
another
and
teach
him
better
than
to
come
parading
himself
in
our
parts
i
owe
something
for
the
way
they
served
me
when
i
was
down
in
their
district
well
come
on
said
the
first
speaker
or
he
will
get
away
whilst
we
are
jawing
about
what
we
shall
do
advancing
to
stevens
he
tapped
that
gentleman
on
the
shoulder
and
said
with
mock
civility
and
in
as
bland
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
really
very
obliging
of
you
mister
to
come
up
here
to
be
flogged
saves
us
the
trouble
of
coming
down
to
you
we
would
like
to
settle
with
you
for
that
drubbing
you
gave
one
of
our
boys
last
week
you
must
be
mistaken
replied
stevens
i
do
know
anything
of
the
affair
to
which
you
allude
you
do
eh
well
take
that
then
to
freshen
your
memory
exclaimed
one
of
the
party
at
the
same
time
dealing
him
a
heavy
blow
on
the
cheek
which
made
the
lamplights
around
appear
to
dance
about
in
the
most
fantastic
style
the
first
impulse
of
stevens
was
to
cry
out
for
the
watchman
but
a
moment
reflection
suggested
the
impolicy
of
that
project
as
he
would
inevitably
be
arrested
with
the
rest
and
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
in
his
present
guise
would
have
entailed
upon
him
very
embarrassing
explanations
he
therefore
thought
it
best
to
beg
off
to
throw
himself
as
it
were
upon
their
sympathies
stop
gentlemen
stop
for
god
sake
stop
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
could
regain
the
breath
that
had
been
almost
knocked
out
of
him
by
the
tremendous
blow
he
had
just
received
do
kill
an
innocent
man
upon
my
honour
i
never
saw
you
before
nor
ever
assaulted
any
of
you
in
my
life
my
dear
friends
he
continued
in
a
dolorous
tone
please
let
me
go
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
assure
you
i
am
not
the
man
no
we
ai
mistaken
either
you
one
of
the
rangers
i
know
you
by
your
coat
replied
one
of
the
assaulters
it
now
flashed
upon
stevens
that
he
had
brought
himself
into
these
difficulties
by
the
assumption
of
the
dress
he
then
wore
he
therefore
quickly
rejoined
oh
it
is
not
my
coat
i
only
put
it
on
for
a
joke
that
a
likely
tale
responded
one
of
the
party
who
looked
very
incredulous
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
that
some
darned
stuff
trumped
up
thinking
to
gammon
us
it
wo
go
down
we
just
give
you
a
walloping
if
it
only
to
teach
you
to
wear
your
own
clothes
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
commenced
pommelling
him
unmercifully
help
help
screamed
stevens
do
kill
me
gentlemen
do
kill
me
oh
we
wo
kill
you
we
only
come
as
near
it
as
we
can
without
quite
finishing
you
cried
one
of
his
relentless
tormenters
on
hearing
this
their
victim
made
a
frantic
effort
to
break
away
and
not
succeeding
in
it
he
commenced
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
the
watchman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
his
cries
only
exasperated
his
persecutors
the
more
hit
him
in
the
and
stop
his
noise
suggested
one
of
the
party
farthest
off
from
stevens
this
piece
of
advice
was
carried
into
immediate
effect
and
the
unfortunate
wearer
of
the
obnoxious
coat
received
a
heavy
blow
in
the
mouth
which
cut
his
lips
and
knocked
out
one
of
his
front
teeth
his
cries
now
became
so
loud
as
to
render
it
necessary
to
gag
him
which
was
done
by
one
of
the
party
in
the
most
thorough
and
expeditious
manner
they
then
dragged
him
into
a
wheelwright
shop
near
by
where
they
obtained
some
tar
with
which
they
coated
his
face
completely
oh
do
he
look
like
a
nigger
said
one
of
the
party
when
they
had
finished
embellishing
their
victim
rub
some
on
his
hands
and
then
let
him
go
suggested
another
when
he
gets
home
i
guess
he
surprise
his
mammy
i
do
believe
his
own
dog
will
know
him
a
shout
of
laughter
followed
this
remark
in
the
midst
of
which
they
ungagged
stevens
and
turned
him
from
the
door
now
run
for
it
cut
the
quickest
kind
of
time
exclaimed
one
of
them
as
he
gave
him
a
kick
to
add
impetus
to
his
forward
movement
this
aid
was
however
entirely
unnecessary
for
stevens
shot
away
from
the
premises
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
and
that
too
without
any
observation
upon
the
direction
in
which
he
was
going
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
out
of
the
reach
of
his
tormentors
he
sat
down
upon
the
steps
of
a
mansion
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
all
the
shops
and
even
the
taverns
were
closed
not
a
place
was
open
where
he
could
procure
the
least
assistance
he
had
not
even
an
acquaintance
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
he
might
apply
he
was
indeed
a
pitiable
object
to
look
upon
the
hat
he
had
so
recently
purchased
bad
as
it
was
when
it
came
into
his
possession
was
now
infinitely
less
presentable
in
the
severe
trials
it
had
undergone
in
company
with
its
unfortunate
owner
it
had
lost
its
tip
and
half
the
brim
the
countenance
beneath
it
would
however
have
absorbed
the
gazer
whole
attention
his
lips
were
swelled
to
a
size
that
would
have
been
regarded
as
large
even
on
the
face
of
a
congo
negro
and
one
eye
was
puffed
out
to
an
alarming
extent
whilst
the
coating
of
tar
he
had
received
rendered
him
such
an
object
as
the
reader
can
but
faintly
picture
to
himself
the
door
of
the
mansion
was
suddenly
opened
and
there
issued
forth
a
party
of
young
men
evidently
in
an
advanced
state
of
intoxication
hallo
here
a
darkey
exclaimed
one
of
them
as
the
light
from
the
hall
fell
upon
the
upturned
face
of
stevens
ha
ha
here
a
darkey
now
for
some
fun
stevens
was
immediately
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
young
men
who
had
evidently
been
enjoying
an
entertainment
not
conducted
upon
temperance
principles
spirit
of
hic
hic
night
whence
thou
stammered
one
art
thou
a
creature
of
the
or
only
a
nigger
speak
stevens
who
at
once
recognized
one
or
two
of
the
parties
as
slight
acquaintances
would
not
open
his
mouth
for
fear
that
his
voice
might
discover
him
as
to
them
above
all
persons
he
would
have
shrunk
from
making
himself
known
he
therefore
began
to
make
signs
as
though
he
were
dumb
let
him
alone
said
one
of
the
more
sober
of
the
party
he
a
poor
dumb
fellow
let
him
go
his
voice
was
disregarded
however
as
the
rest
seemed
bent
on
having
some
sport
a
nearly
filled
with
water
which
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
pavement
for
the
convenience
of
the
builders
who
were
at
work
next
door
caught
the
attention
of
one
of
them
let
make
him
jump
into
this
he
exclaimed
at
the
same
time
motioning
to
stevens
to
that
effect
by
dint
of
great
effort
they
made
him
understand
what
was
required
and
they
then
continued
to
make
him
jump
in
and
out
of
the
hogshead
for
several
minutes
then
joining
hands
they
danced
around
him
whilst
he
stood
in
the
water
shivering
and
making
the
most
imploring
motions
to
be
set
at
liberty
whilst
they
were
thus
engaged
the
door
again
opened
and
the
fashionable
morton
who
had
been
one
of
the
guests
descended
the
steps
and
came
to
see
what
had
been
productive
of
so
much
mirth
what
have
you
got
here
he
asked
pressing
forward
until
he
saw
the
battered
form
of
stevens
oh
let
the
poor
darkey
go
he
continued
compassionately
for
he
had
just
drunk
enough
to
make
him
feel
humane
let
the
poor
fellow
go
it
a
shame
to
treat
him
in
this
manner
as
he
spoke
he
endeavoured
to
take
from
the
hands
of
one
of
the
party
a
piece
of
chip
with
which
he
was
industriously
engaged
in
streaking
the
face
of
stevens
with
lime
let
me
alone
morton
let
me
alone
making
a
white
man
of
him
i
going
to
make
him
a
glorious
and
have
him
run
for
congress
let
me
alone
i
say
morton
was
able
however
after
some
persuasion
to
induce
the
young
men
to
depart
and
as
his
home
lay
in
a
direction
opposite
to
theirs
he
said
to
stevens
come
on
old
fellow
i
protect
you
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
stevens
exclaimed
do
you
know
me
morton
morton
started
back
with
surprise
and
looked
at
his
companion
in
a
bewildered
manner
then
exclaimed
no
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
who
the
devil
are
you
i
stevens
you
know
me
indeed
i
do
who
stevens
you
do
know
me
why
i
george
stevens
the
lawyer
morton
thought
that
he
now
recognized
the
voice
and
as
they
were
passing
under
the
lamp
at
the
time
stevens
said
to
him
put
your
finger
on
my
face
and
you
will
soon
see
it
is
only
tar
morton
did
as
he
was
desired
and
found
his
finger
smeared
with
the
sticky
article
what
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
he
asked
with
great
surprise
what
is
all
this
masquerading
for
stevens
hereupon
related
his
visit
at
whitticar
and
detailed
the
events
that
had
subsequently
occurred
morton
gave
vent
to
shouts
of
laughter
as
he
listened
to
the
recital
of
his
friend
by
george
he
exclaimed
i
have
to
tell
that
it
is
too
good
to
keep
oh
no
do
said
stevens
that
wo
do
you
forget
what
i
came
out
for
true
rejoined
morton
i
suppose
it
will
be
best
to
keep
mum
about
it
i
go
home
with
you
you
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
again
thank
you
thank
you
replied
stevens
who
felt
greatly
relieved
to
have
some
company
for
his
further
protection
and
continued
he
if
i
could
only
get
some
of
this
infernal
stuff
off
my
face
i
should
be
so
glad
let
us
try
accordingly
they
stopped
at
the
nearest
pump
and
endeavoured
to
remove
some
of
the
obnoxious
tar
from
his
face
but
unfortunately
the
only
result
obtained
by
their
efforts
was
to
rub
it
more
thoroughly
in
so
they
were
compelled
to
give
up
in
despair
and
hasten
onward
stevens
rang
so
loudly
at
the
door
as
to
quite
startle
his
wife
and
the
both
of
whom
had
fallen
into
a
sound
sleep
as
they
sat
together
awaiting
his
return
morton
who
as
we
have
said
before
was
not
entirely
sober
was
singing
a
popular
melody
and
keeping
time
upon
the
door
with
the
head
of
his
cane
now
in
all
her
life
stevens
had
never
heard
her
husband
utter
a
note
and
being
greatly
frightened
at
the
unusual
noise
upon
the
held
a
hurried
consultation
with
the
upon
the
best
mode
of
proceeding
call
through
the
suggested
she
which
advice
stevens
immediately
followed
and
inquired
who
there
open
the
door
jule
do
keep
me
out
here
with
your
darned
nonsense
let
me
in
quick
yes
let
him
in
added
morton
he
brought
a
gentleman
from
africa
with
him
stevens
did
not
exactly
catch
the
purport
of
the
words
uttered
by
morton
and
therefore
when
she
opened
the
door
and
her
husband
with
his
face
stalked
into
the
entry
she
could
not
repress
a
scream
of
fright
at
the
hideous
figure
he
presented
hush
hush
he
exclaimed
do
arouse
the
neighbours
it
me
you
know
my
voice
stevens
stared
at
him
in
a
bewildered
manner
and
after
bidding
morton
good
night
she
closed
and
locked
the
door
and
followed
her
husband
into
the
back
room
in
a
short
time
he
recapitulated
the
events
of
the
night
to
his
astonished
and
indignant
spouse
who
greatly
commiserated
his
misfortunes
a
bottle
of
sweet
oil
was
brought
into
requisition
and
she
made
a
lengthened
effort
to
remove
the
tar
from
her
husband
face
in
which
she
only
partially
succeeded
and
it
was
almost
day
when
he
crawled
off
to
bed
with
the
skin
half
scraped
off
from
his
swollen
face
chapter
xix
the
alarm
immediately
after
the
departure
of
stevens
master
kinch
began
to
consider
the
propriety
of
closing
the
establishment
for
the
night
sliding
down
from
the
counter
where
he
had
been
seated
reflecting
upon
the
strange
conduct
of
his
recent
customer
he
said
i
feels
rather
queer
round
about
here
laying
his
hand
upon
his
stomach
and
i
inclined
to
think
that
some
of
them
jersey
sausages
and
buckwheat
cakes
that
the
old
man
has
been
stuffing
himself
with
would
go
down
slow
rather
shabby
in
him
not
to
come
back
and
let
me
go
home
and
have
a
slap
at
the
wittles
i
expect
nothing
else
but
that
he
has
eat
so
much
that
he
fell
asleep
at
the
and
wo
wake
up
till
bedtime
he
always
serving
me
that
same
trick
the
old
man
thus
alluded
to
was
no
other
than
master
kinch
father
who
had
departed
from
the
shop
two
or
three
hours
previously
promising
to
return
immediately
after
tea
this
promise
appeared
to
have
entirely
faded
from
his
recollection
as
he
was
at
that
moment
as
kinch
had
supposed
fast
asleep
and
totally
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
such
a
person
as
his
hungry
descendant
was
in
existence
having
fully
come
to
the
conclusion
to
suspend
operations
for
the
evening
kinch
made
two
or
three
excursions
into
the
street
returning
each
time
laden
with
old
hats
coats
and
shoes
these
he
deposited
on
the
counter
without
order
or
arrangement
muttering
as
he
did
so
that
the
old
man
could
sort
out
in
the
morning
to
suit
himself
the
things
being
all
brought
from
the
street
he
had
only
to
close
the
shutters
which
operation
was
soon
effected
and
our
hungry
friend
on
his
way
home
the
next
morning
de
younge
for
the
father
of
kinch
rejoiced
in
that
aristocratic
cognomen
was
early
at
his
receptacle
for
old
clothes
and
it
being
he
anticipated
doing
a
good
business
the
old
man
leisurely
took
down
the
shutters
assorted
and
hung
out
the
old
clothes
and
was
busily
engaged
in
sweeping
out
the
store
when
his
eye
fell
upon
the
paper
dropped
by
stevens
the
evening
previous
what
dis
said
he
stooping
to
pick
it
up
bill
or
suthin
like
it
i
what
a
trial
is
not
to
be
able
to
read
writin
do
know
whether
is
worth
keeping
or
not
best
save
it
though
till
dat
ar
boy
of
mine
comes
can
read
it
he
a
scholar
ah
de
children
has
greater
than
deir
poor
fathers
had
whilst
he
was
thus
soliloquizing
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
noise
of
footsteps
in
the
other
part
of
the
shop
and
looking
up
he
discerned
the
tall
form
of
walters
why
bless
me
said
the
old
man
dis
is
an
early
visit
where
you
come
from
honey
dis
time
o
day
oh
i
take
a
walk
every
morning
to
breathe
a
little
of
the
fresh
air
it
gives
one
an
appetite
for
breakfast
you
know
you
let
me
take
the
liberty
of
sitting
on
your
counter
wo
you
he
continued
i
want
to
read
a
little
article
in
a
newspaper
i
have
just
purchased
assent
being
readily
given
walters
was
soon
perusing
the
journal
with
great
attention
at
last
he
tossed
it
from
him
in
an
impatient
manner
and
exclaimed
of
all
lying
rascals
i
think
the
reporters
for
this
paper
are
the
greatest
now
for
instance
three
or
four
nights
since
a
gang
of
villains
assaulted
one
of
my
tenants
a
coloured
man
upon
his
own
doorstep
and
nearly
killed
him
and
that
too
without
the
slightest
provocation
they
then
set
fire
to
the
house
which
was
half
consumed
before
it
could
be
extinguished
and
it
is
here
stated
that
the
coloured
people
were
the
aggressors
and
whilst
they
were
engaged
in
the
the
house
caught
fire
accidentally
yes
rejoined
de
younge
things
are
gitting
mighty
critical
even
in
dese
parts
and
i
live
furder
down
town
if
you
was
to
give
me
a
house
why
raly
dangerous
to
go
home
nights
down
dere
and
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
we
may
be
any
better
off
up
here
continued
walters
the
authorities
do
seem
to
take
the
least
notice
of
them
and
the
rioters
appear
to
be
having
it
all
their
own
way
they
continued
conversing
upon
the
topic
for
some
time
de
younge
being
meanwhile
engaged
in
sponging
and
cleaning
some
coats
he
had
purchased
the
day
before
in
so
doing
he
was
obliged
to
remove
the
paper
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
walters
to
read
it
he
therefore
handed
it
to
him
saying
jist
read
dat
honey
wo
you
i
want
to
know
if
it
worth
savin
burnt
up
two
or
three
receipts
in
my
life
and
had
de
bills
to
pay
over
and
got
rale
careful
you
know
pleasant
to
pay
money
twice
over
for
de
same
thing
walters
took
the
paper
extended
to
him
and
after
glancing
over
it
remarked
this
handwriting
is
very
familiar
to
me
very
but
whose
it
is
i
ca
say
it
appears
to
be
a
list
of
addresses
or
something
of
that
kind
and
he
read
over
various
names
of
streets
and
numbers
of
houses
why
he
exclaimed
with
a
start
of
surprise
here
is
my
own
house
upon
the
list
then
here
is
here
also
are
numbers
in
sixth
seventh
and
eighth
streets
in
some
of
which
houses
i
know
coloured
people
live
for
one
or
two
of
them
are
my
own
this
is
a
strange
affair
as
he
spoke
he
turned
over
the
paper
and
read
on
the
other
side
places
to
be
attacked
why
this
looks
serious
he
continued
with
some
excitement
of
manner
to
be
attacked
do
that
seem
to
you
as
if
it
might
be
a
list
of
places
for
these
rioters
to
set
upon
i
really
must
look
into
this
who
could
have
left
it
here
i
raly
do
know
replied
the
old
man
kinch
told
me
suthin
last
night
about
some
gemman
comin
here
and
changing
his
clothes
was
him
i
like
to
know
who
was
myself
well
wait
awhile
my
boy
will
come
in
directly
maybe
he
can
explain
it
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
master
kinch
made
his
appearance
with
his
hat
as
usual
placed
upon
nine
hairs
and
his
mouth
smeared
with
the
eggs
and
bacon
with
which
he
had
been
staying
and
comforting
himself
he
took
off
his
hat
on
perceiving
walters
and
with
great
humility
hoped
that
gentleman
was
well
yes
very
well
kinch
replied
walters
we
were
waiting
for
you
can
you
tell
where
this
came
from
he
asked
handing
him
the
mysterious
paper
never
seen
it
before
that
i
know
of
replied
kinch
after
a
short
inspection
well
who
was
here
last
night
asked
his
father
you
said
you
sold
suthin
so
i
did
replied
kinch
sold
a
whole
suit
and
the
gentleman
who
put
it
on
said
he
was
going
out
for
a
lark
he
was
changing
some
papers
from
his
pocket
perhaps
he
dropped
it
i
to
take
this
suit
back
to
him
here
is
his
card
by
heavens
exclaimed
walters
after
looking
at
the
card
i
know
the
fellow
george
stevens
george
every
one
knows
him
and
can
speak
no
good
of
him
either
now
i
recognize
the
handwriting
of
the
list
i
begin
to
suspect
something
wrong
by
seeing
his
name
in
connection
with
this
hereupon
kinch
was
subjected
to
a
severe
which
had
the
effect
of
deepening
walters
impression
that
some
plot
was
being
concocted
that
would
result
to
the
detriment
of
the
coloured
people
for
he
was
confident
that
no
good
could
be
indicated
by
the
mysterious
conduct
of
stevens
after
some
deliberation
kinch
received
instructions
to
take
home
the
clothes
as
directed
and
to
have
his
eyes
about
him
and
if
he
saw
or
heard
anything
he
was
to
report
it
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
master
kinch
made
several
journeys
to
stevens
office
but
did
not
succeed
in
finding
that
gentleman
within
the
last
trip
he
made
there
fatigued
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
determined
to
wait
his
arrival
as
he
judged
from
the
lateness
of
the
hour
that
if
it
was
his
intention
to
come
at
all
that
day
he
would
soon
be
there
i
sit
down
here
said
kinch
who
espied
an
old
box
in
the
back
part
of
the
entry
and
give
myself
a
little
time
to
blow
he
had
not
sat
long
before
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
presently
the
sound
of
voices
became
quite
audible
that
him
ejaculated
kinch
as
stevens
was
heard
saying
in
an
angry
tone
yes
and
a
devil
of
a
scrape
i
got
into
by
your
want
of
sobriety
had
you
followed
my
directions
and
met
me
at
whitticar
instead
of
getting
drunk
as
a
beast
and
being
obliged
to
go
home
to
bed
it
would
have
happened
well
squire
replied
mccloskey
for
he
was
the
person
addressed
by
stevens
a
man
ca
be
expected
always
to
keep
sober
he
ought
to
when
he
has
business
before
him
rejoined
stevens
sharply
how
the
devil
am
i
to
trust
you
to
do
anything
of
importance
when
i
ca
depend
on
your
keeping
sober
a
day
at
a
time
come
up
to
this
top
landing
continued
he
and
listen
to
me
if
you
think
you
are
sober
enough
to
comprehend
what
i
say
to
you
they
now
approached
and
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
the
place
where
kinch
was
sitting
and
stevens
said
with
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
now
i
want
you
to
pay
the
strictest
attention
to
what
i
say
i
had
a
list
of
places
made
out
for
you
last
night
but
somehow
or
other
i
lost
it
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
attend
to
particularly
do
attempt
anything
you
ca
get
a
sufficient
number
of
the
boys
together
but
when
you
do
go
you
are
to
take
first
between
eleventh
and
twelfth
there
are
several
nigger
families
living
in
that
block
smash
in
their
windows
break
their
furniture
and
if
possible
set
one
of
the
houses
on
fire
and
that
will
draw
attention
to
that
locality
whilst
you
are
operating
elsewhere
by
that
time
the
boys
will
be
ripe
for
anything
then
you
had
better
go
to
a
house
in
corner
of
shotwell
there
is
a
rich
nigger
living
there
whose
plunder
is
worth
something
i
owe
him
an
old
grudge
and
i
want
you
to
pay
it
off
for
me
you
keep
me
pretty
busy
paying
your
debts
what
the
name
of
this
rich
nigger
walters
replied
stevens
everybody
knows
him
now
about
that
other
affair
here
he
whispered
so
low
that
kinch
could
only
learn
they
were
planning
an
attack
on
the
house
of
some
one
but
failed
in
discovering
the
name
mccloskey
departed
as
soon
as
he
had
received
full
directions
from
stevens
and
his
retreating
steps
might
be
still
heard
upon
the
stairs
when
stevens
unlocked
his
and
entered
after
giving
him
sufficient
time
to
get
quietly
seated
kinch
followed
and
delivered
the
clothes
left
with
him
the
evening
previous
he
was
very
much
struck
with
stevens
altered
appearance
and
in
fact
would
not
have
recognized
him
but
for
his
voice
you
do
seem
to
be
well
remarked
kinch
inquiringly
no
i
not
he
replied
gruffly
i
caught
cold
as
kinch
was
leaving
the
office
he
called
after
him
did
you
find
a
paper
in
your
shop
this
morning
no
sir
replied
kinch
but
mentally
he
observed
my
daddy
did
though
and
fearful
of
some
other
troublesome
question
he
took
leave
immediately
fatigued
and
out
of
breath
kinch
arrived
at
the
house
of
walters
where
he
considered
it
best
to
go
and
communicate
what
he
had
learned
walters
was
at
dinner
when
he
received
from
the
maid
a
summons
to
the
parlour
to
see
a
lad
who
said
his
business
was
a
matter
of
life
or
death
he
was
obliged
to
smile
at
the
air
of
importance
with
which
kinch
commenced
the
relation
of
what
he
had
overheard
but
the
smile
gave
place
to
a
look
of
anxiety
and
indignation
long
ere
he
had
finished
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
communication
he
was
highly
excited
and
alarmed
the
infernal
scoundrel
exclaimed
walters
are
you
sure
it
was
my
house
yes
sure
was
kinch
reply
you
are
the
only
coloured
person
living
in
the
square
and
he
said
plain
enough
for
anybody
to
understand
corner
of
shotwell
i
heard
every
word
but
what
they
said
towards
the
last
in
a
whisper
you
could
catch
anything
of
it
asked
walters
no
i
missed
that
they
talked
too
low
for
me
to
hear
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
walters
said
not
a
word
of
this
is
to
be
lisped
anywhere
except
with
my
permission
and
by
my
direction
have
you
had
your
dinner
no
sir
was
the
prompt
reply
i
want
to
despatch
a
note
to
ellis
by
you
if
it
wo
trouble
you
too
much
can
you
oblige
me
oh
yes
sir
by
all
means
replied
kinch
i
go
there
with
pleasure
then
whilst
i
writing
continued
walters
you
can
be
eating
your
dinner
that
will
economize
time
you
know
kinch
followed
the
servant
who
answered
the
bell
into
the
which
walters
had
just
left
on
being
supplied
with
a
knife
and
fork
he
helped
himself
bountifully
to
the
roast
duck
then
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
he
drank
with
great
enthusiasm
to
our
honoured
self
which
proceeding
caused
infinite
amusement
to
the
two
servants
who
were
peeping
at
him
through
the
door
exclaimed
kinch
depositing
his
glass
upon
the
table
guess
i
try
another
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
refilled
his
glass
and
dispatched
its
contents
in
the
wake
of
the
other
having
laboured
upon
the
duck
until
his
appetite
was
somewhat
appeased
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
suffered
his
plate
to
be
changed
for
another
which
being
done
he
made
an
attack
upon
a
peach
pie
and
nearly
demolished
it
outright
this
last
performance
brought
his
meal
to
a
conclusion
and
with
a
look
of
weariness
he
remarked
i
do
see
how
it
is
but
as
soon
as
i
have
eat
for
a
little
while
my
appetite
is
sure
to
leave
me
now
i
ca
eat
a
bit
more
but
the
worst
thing
is
walking
down
to
ellis
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
it
but
i
suppose
i
must
and
reluctantly
rising
from
the
table
he
returned
to
the
parlour
where
he
found
walters
folding
the
note
he
had
promised
to
deliver
as
soon
as
he
had
despatched
kinch
on
his
errand
walters
put
on
his
hat
and
walked
to
the
office
of
the
mayor
is
his
honour
in
he
asked
of
one
of
the
police
who
was
lounging
in
the
anteroom
yes
he
is
what
do
you
want
with
him
asked
the
official
in
a
rude
tone
that
sir
is
none
of
your
business
replied
walters
if
the
mayor
is
in
hand
him
this
card
and
say
i
wish
to
see
him
somewhat
awed
by
walters
dignified
and
decided
manner
the
man
went
quickly
to
deliver
his
message
and
returned
with
an
answer
that
his
honour
would
be
obliged
to
walters
if
he
would
step
into
his
office
on
following
the
officer
he
was
ushered
into
a
small
room
the
private
office
of
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
take
a
seat
sir
said
the
mayor
politely
it
is
some
time
since
we
have
met
i
think
i
had
the
pleasure
of
transacting
business
with
you
quite
frequently
some
years
back
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
are
quite
correct
replied
walters
and
being
so
favourably
impressed
by
your
courtesy
on
the
occasions
to
which
you
refer
i
have
ventured
to
intrude
upon
you
with
a
matter
of
great
importance
not
only
to
myself
but
i
think
i
may
say
to
the
public
generally
since
this
morning
circumstances
have
come
under
my
notice
that
leave
no
doubt
on
my
mind
that
a
plan
is
afoot
for
the
destruction
of
the
property
of
a
large
number
of
our
coloured
citizens
mine
amongst
the
rest
you
must
be
aware
he
continued
that
many
very
serious
disturbances
have
occurred
lately
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
yes
i
heard
something
respecting
it
replied
the
mayor
but
i
believe
they
were
nothing
more
than
trifling
combats
between
the
negroes
and
the
whites
in
that
vicinity
oh
no
sir
i
assure
you
rejoined
walters
they
were
and
are
anything
but
trifling
i
regard
them
however
as
only
faint
indications
of
what
we
may
expect
if
the
thing
is
not
promptly
suppressed
there
is
an
organized
gang
of
villains
who
are
combined
for
the
sole
purpose
of
mobbing
us
coloured
citizens
and
as
we
are
inoffensive
we
certainly
deserve
protection
and
here
continued
walters
is
a
copy
of
the
list
of
places
upon
which
it
is
rumoured
an
attack
is
to
be
made
i
really
do
see
how
i
to
prevent
it
walters
with
the
exception
of
your
own
residence
all
that
are
here
enumerated
are
out
of
my
jurisdiction
i
can
send
two
or
three
police
for
your
protection
if
you
think
it
necessary
but
i
really
ca
see
my
way
clear
to
do
anything
further
two
or
three
police
said
walters
with
rising
indignation
at
the
apathy
and
indifference
the
mayor
exhibited
they
would
scarcely
be
of
any
more
use
than
as
many
women
if
that
is
the
extent
of
the
aid
you
can
afford
me
i
must
do
what
i
can
to
protect
myself
i
trust
your
fears
lead
you
to
exaggerate
the
danger
said
the
mayor
as
walters
arose
to
depart
perhaps
it
is
rumour
after
all
i
might
have
flattered
myself
with
the
same
idea
did
i
not
feel
convinced
by
what
has
so
recently
occurred
but
a
short
distance
from
my
own
house
at
any
rate
if
i
am
attacked
they
will
find
i
am
not
unprepared
good
day
and
bowing
courteously
to
the
mayor
walters
departed
chapter
xx
the
attack
walters
lost
no
time
in
sending
messengers
to
the
various
parties
threatened
by
the
mob
warning
them
either
to
leave
their
houses
or
to
make
every
exertion
for
a
vigorous
defence
few
however
adopted
the
latter
extremity
the
majority
fled
from
their
homes
leaving
what
effects
they
could
not
carry
away
at
the
mercy
of
the
mob
and
sought
an
asylum
in
the
houses
of
such
whites
as
would
give
them
shelter
although
the
authorities
of
the
district
had
received
the
most
positive
information
of
the
nefarious
schemes
of
the
rioters
they
had
not
made
the
slightest
efforts
to
protect
the
poor
creatures
threatened
in
their
persons
and
property
but
let
the
tide
of
lawlessness
flow
on
unchecked
throughout
the
day
parties
of
coloured
people
might
have
been
seen
hurrying
to
the
upper
part
of
the
city
women
with
terror
written
on
their
faces
some
with
babes
in
their
arms
and
children
at
their
side
hastening
to
some
temporary
place
of
refuge
in
company
with
men
who
were
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
household
goods
walters
had
converted
his
house
into
a
temporary
fortress
the
shutters
of
the
upper
windows
had
been
double
bars
had
been
placed
across
the
doors
and
windows
on
the
ground
floor
carpets
had
been
taken
up
superfluous
furniture
removed
and
an
air
of
thorough
preparation
imparted
a
few
of
walters
male
friends
had
volunteered
their
aid
in
defence
of
his
house
and
their
services
had
been
accepted
ellis
whose
house
was
quite
indefensible
it
being
situated
in
a
neighbourhood
swarming
with
the
class
of
which
the
mob
was
composed
had
decided
on
bringing
his
family
to
the
house
of
walters
and
sharing
with
him
the
fortunes
of
the
night
his
wife
and
daughters
having
declared
they
would
feel
as
safe
there
as
elsewhere
and
accordingly
about
five
in
the
afternoon
ellis
came
up
accompanied
by
kinch
and
the
girls
caddy
and
kinch
who
brought
up
the
rear
seemed
very
solicitous
respecting
the
safety
of
a
package
that
the
latter
bore
in
his
arms
what
have
you
there
asked
walters
with
a
smile
it
must
be
powder
or
some
other
explosive
matter
you
take
such
wonderful
pains
for
its
preservation
come
caddy
tell
us
what
it
is
is
it
powder
no
walters
it
is
powder
she
replied
it
nothing
that
will
blow
the
house
up
or
burn
it
down
what
is
it
then
you
tell
us
kinch
just
do
if
you
think
best
said
caddy
giving
him
a
threatening
glance
whereupon
master
kinch
looked
as
much
as
to
say
if
you
were
to
put
me
on
the
rack
you
could
get
a
word
out
of
me
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
give
you
up
said
walters
at
last
but
do
stand
here
in
the
entry
come
up
into
the
ellis
and
esther
followed
him
upstairs
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
surveying
the
preparations
for
defence
that
the
appearance
of
the
room
so
abundantly
indicated
guns
were
stacked
in
the
corner
a
number
of
pistols
lay
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
a
pile
of
cartridges
was
heaped
up
beside
a
small
keg
of
powder
that
stood
upon
the
table
opposite
the
dear
me
exclaimed
ellis
this
looks
dreadful
it
almost
frightens
me
out
of
my
wits
to
see
so
many
dangerous
weapons
scattered
about
and
how
does
it
affect
our
quiet
esther
asked
walters
it
makes
me
wish
i
were
a
man
she
replied
with
considerable
vehemence
of
manner
all
started
at
this
language
from
one
of
her
usually
gentle
demeanour
why
esther
how
you
talk
girl
what
come
over
you
talk
replied
she
i
say
nothing
that
i
do
not
feel
as
we
came
through
the
streets
and
i
saw
so
many
inoffensive
creatures
who
like
ourselves
have
never
done
these
white
wretches
the
least
injury
to
see
them
and
us
driven
from
our
homes
by
a
mob
of
wretches
who
can
accuse
us
of
nothing
but
being
darker
than
themselves
it
takes
all
the
woman
out
of
my
bosom
and
makes
me
feel
like
a
here
esther
paused
and
bit
her
lip
to
prevent
the
utterance
of
a
fierce
expression
that
hovered
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
she
then
continued
one
poor
woman
in
particular
i
noticed
she
had
a
babe
in
her
arms
poor
thing
and
was
weeping
bitterly
because
she
knew
of
no
place
to
go
to
seek
for
shelter
or
protection
a
couple
of
white
men
stood
by
jeering
and
taunting
her
i
felt
as
though
i
could
have
strangled
them
had
i
been
a
man
i
would
have
attacked
them
on
the
spot
if
i
had
been
sure
they
would
have
killed
me
the
next
moment
hush
esther
hush
my
child
you
must
not
talk
so
it
sounds
unwomanly
unchristian
why
i
never
heard
you
talk
so
before
esther
made
no
reply
but
stood
resting
her
forehead
upon
the
mantelpiece
her
face
was
flushed
with
excitement
and
her
dark
eyes
glistened
like
polished
jet
walters
stood
regarding
her
for
a
time
with
evident
admiration
and
then
said
you
are
a
brave
one
after
my
own
heart
esther
hung
down
her
head
confused
by
the
ardent
look
he
cast
upon
her
as
he
continued
you
have
taken
me
by
surprise
but
it
always
the
way
with
you
quiet
people
events
like
these
bring
you
out
seem
to
change
your
very
natures
as
it
were
we
must
look
out
said
he
with
a
smile
turning
to
one
of
the
young
men
or
miss
ellis
will
excel
us
all
in
courage
i
shall
expect
great
things
from
her
if
we
are
attacked
do
make
a
jest
of
me
walters
said
esther
and
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
moistened
and
her
lip
quivered
with
vexation
no
no
my
dear
girl
do
misunderstand
me
replied
he
quickly
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
i
truly
meant
all
that
i
said
i
believe
you
to
be
a
brave
girl
if
you
really
think
so
rejoined
esther
prove
it
by
showing
me
how
to
load
these
as
she
spoke
she
took
from
the
mantel
one
of
the
pistols
that
were
lying
there
and
turned
it
over
to
examine
it
oh
put
that
down
esther
put
that
down
immediately
almost
screamed
ellis
what
with
your
speeches
and
your
guns
you
quite
set
me
crazy
do
take
it
from
her
walters
it
will
certainly
go
off
there
not
the
least
danger
ellen
he
replied
there
nothing
in
it
well
i
afraid
of
guns
loaded
or
unloaded
they
are
dangerous
all
of
them
whether
they
have
anything
in
them
or
not
do
you
hear
me
esther
do
put
that
down
and
come
out
of
here
oh
no
mother
said
she
do
let
me
remain
there
i
lay
the
pistols
down
and
wo
touch
them
again
whilst
you
are
in
the
room
you
may
safely
leave
her
in
my
hands
interposed
walters
if
she
wants
to
learn
let
her
it
wo
injure
her
in
the
least
i
take
care
of
that
this
assurance
somewhat
quieted
ellis
who
left
the
room
and
took
up
her
quarters
in
another
apartment
now
walters
said
esther
taking
off
her
bonnet
i
quite
in
earnest
about
learning
to
load
these
pistols
and
i
wish
you
to
instruct
me
you
may
be
hard
pressed
tonight
and
unable
to
load
for
yourselves
and
in
such
an
emergency
i
could
perhaps
be
of
great
use
to
you
but
my
child
replied
he
to
be
of
use
in
the
manner
you
propose
you
would
be
compelled
to
remain
in
quite
an
exposed
situation
i
am
aware
of
that
calmly
rejoined
esther
and
still
you
are
not
afraid
he
asked
in
surprise
why
should
i
be
i
shall
not
be
any
more
exposed
than
you
or
my
father
that
enough
i
teach
you
look
here
said
walters
observe
how
i
load
this
esther
gave
her
undivided
attention
to
the
work
before
her
and
when
he
had
finished
she
took
up
another
pistol
and
loaded
it
with
a
precision
and
celerity
that
would
have
reflected
honour
on
a
more
practised
hand
well
done
capital
exclaimed
walters
as
she
laid
down
the
weapon
you
do
my
girl
as
i
said
before
you
are
one
after
my
own
heart
now
whilst
you
are
loading
the
rest
i
will
go
downstairs
where
i
have
some
little
matters
to
attend
to
on
the
he
was
met
by
kinch
and
caddy
who
were
tugging
up
a
large
kettle
of
water
is
it
possible
caddy
asked
walters
that
your
propensity
to
dabble
in
soap
and
water
has
overcome
you
even
at
this
critical
time
you
certainly
ca
be
going
to
scrub
no
i
not
going
to
scrub
she
replied
nor
do
anything
like
it
got
our
plans
have
we
kinch
let
hear
what
your
plans
are
i
like
to
be
enlightened
a
little
if
convenient
said
walters
well
it
convenient
walters
so
you
need
not
expect
to
hear
a
word
about
them
you
only
laugh
if
we
were
to
tell
you
so
we
going
to
keep
it
to
ourselves
ai
we
kinch
the
latter
thus
appealed
to
put
on
an
air
of
profound
mystery
and
intimated
that
if
they
were
permitted
to
pursue
the
even
tenor
of
their
way
great
results
might
be
expected
but
if
they
were
balked
in
their
designs
he
could
not
answer
for
the
consequences
you
and
esther
have
your
plans
resumed
caddy
and
we
have
ours
we
do
believe
in
powder
and
shot
and
do
want
anything
to
do
with
guns
for
my
part
i
afraid
of
them
so
please
let
us
go
by
do
now
that
a
good
soul
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
the
commander
of
this
fortress
said
walters
and
that
i
have
a
right
to
know
everything
that
transpires
within
it
but
i
see
you
look
obstinate
and
as
i
have
time
to
settle
the
matter
now
you
may
pass
on
i
wonder
what
they
can
be
about
he
remarked
as
they
hurried
on
i
must
steal
up
and
see
for
myself
one
after
another
the
various
friends
of
walters
came
in
each
bringing
some
vague
report
of
the
designs
of
the
mob
they
all
described
the
excitement
as
growing
more
intense
that
the
houses
of
various
prominent
abolitionists
had
been
threatened
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
fire
one
of
the
coloured
churches
and
that
notwithstanding
the
rioters
made
little
scruple
in
declaring
their
intentions
the
authorities
were
not
using
the
slightest
effort
to
restrain
them
or
to
protect
the
parties
threatened
day
was
fast
waning
and
the
approaching
night
brought
with
it
clouds
and
cold
whilst
they
had
been
engaged
in
their
preparations
for
defence
none
had
time
to
reflect
upon
the
danger
of
their
situation
but
now
that
all
was
prepared
and
there
was
nothing
to
sustain
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
hours
a
chill
crept
over
the
circle
who
were
gathered
round
the
fire
there
were
no
candles
burning
and
the
uncertain
glow
from
the
grate
gave
a
rather
look
to
the
group
the
arms
stacked
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
the
occasional
glitter
of
the
as
the
flames
rose
and
fell
gave
the
whole
a
peculiarly
strange
effect
we
look
belligerent
enough
i
should
think
remarked
walters
looking
around
him
i
wish
we
were
well
out
of
this
it
terrible
to
be
driven
to
these
extremities
but
we
are
not
the
aggressors
thank
god
and
the
results
be
they
what
they
may
are
not
of
our
seeking
i
have
a
right
to
defend
my
own
i
have
asked
protection
of
the
law
and
it
is
too
weak
or
too
indifferent
to
give
it
so
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
protect
myself
but
who
is
here
it
has
grown
so
dark
in
the
room
that
i
can
scarcely
distinguish
any
one
where
are
all
the
ladies
none
are
here
except
myself
answered
esther
all
the
rest
are
below
stairs
and
where
are
you
i
hear
but
ca
see
you
give
me
your
hand
said
he
extending
his
own
in
the
direction
from
which
her
voice
proceeded
how
cold
your
hand
is
he
continued
are
you
frightened
frightened
she
replied
i
never
felt
calmer
in
my
life
put
your
finger
on
my
pulse
walters
did
as
he
was
desired
and
exclaimed
steady
as
a
clock
i
trust
nothing
may
occur
before
morning
to
cause
it
to
beat
more
hurriedly
let
us
put
some
wood
on
these
coals
suggested
ellis
it
will
make
a
slight
blaze
and
give
us
a
chance
to
see
each
other
as
he
spoke
he
took
up
a
few
small
fagots
and
cast
them
upon
the
fire
the
wood
snapped
and
crackled
as
the
flames
mounted
the
chimney
and
cast
a
cheerful
glow
upon
the
surrounding
objects
suddenly
a
thoroughly
ignited
piece
flew
off
from
the
rest
and
fell
on
the
table
in
the
midst
of
the
cartridges
run
for
your
lives
shrieked
one
of
the
party
the
powder
the
powder
simultaneously
they
nearly
all
rushed
to
the
door
walters
stood
as
one
petrified
esther
alone
of
the
whole
party
retained
her
presence
of
mind
springing
forward
she
grasped
the
blazing
fragment
and
dashed
it
back
again
into
the
grate
all
this
passed
in
a
few
seconds
and
in
the
end
esther
was
so
overcome
with
excitement
and
terror
that
she
fainted
outright
hearing
no
report
those
who
had
fled
cautiously
returned
and
by
their
united
efforts
she
was
soon
restored
to
consciousness
what
a
narrow
escape
said
she
trembling
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
it
we
owe
our
lives
to
you
my
brave
girl
said
walters
your
presence
of
mind
has
quite
put
us
all
to
the
blush
oh
move
the
powder
some
distance
off
or
the
same
thing
may
happen
again
please
do
move
it
walters
i
shall
have
no
peace
whilst
it
is
there
whilst
they
were
thus
engaged
a
loud
commotion
was
heard
below
stairs
and
with
one
accord
all
started
in
the
direction
from
whence
the
noise
proceeded
bring
a
light
bring
a
light
cried
ellis
something
dreadful
has
happened
a
light
was
soon
procured
and
the
cause
of
this
second
alarm
fully
ascertained
master
kinch
in
his
anxiety
to
give
himself
as
warlike
an
appearance
as
possible
had
added
to
his
accoutrements
an
old
sword
that
he
had
discovered
in
an
corner
of
the
garret
not
being
accustomed
to
weapons
of
this
nature
he
had
been
constantly
getting
it
between
his
legs
and
had
already
been
precipitated
by
it
down
a
flight
of
steps
to
the
imminent
risk
of
his
neck
undaunted
however
by
this
mishap
he
had
clung
to
it
with
wonderful
tenacity
until
it
had
again
caused
a
disaster
the
noise
of
which
had
brought
all
parties
into
the
room
where
it
had
occurred
the
light
being
brought
master
kinch
crawled
out
from
under
a
table
with
his
head
and
back
covered
with
batter
a
pan
of
which
had
been
overturned
upon
him
in
consequence
of
his
having
been
tripped
up
by
his
sword
and
falling
violently
against
the
table
on
which
it
stood
i
said
you
had
better
take
that
skewer
off
exclaimed
caddy
it
a
wonder
it
has
broke
your
neck
before
now
but
you
are
such
a
goose
you
would
wear
it
said
she
surveying
her
with
derision
as
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
scrape
the
batter
from
his
face
please
give
me
some
water
cried
kinch
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
laughing
group
help
a
feller
to
get
it
off
ca
you
it
all
in
my
eyes
and
the
yeast
is
blinding
me
the
only
answer
to
this
appeal
was
an
additional
shout
of
laughter
without
the
slightest
effort
for
his
relief
at
last
caddy
taking
compassion
upon
his
forlorn
condition
procured
a
basin
of
water
and
assisted
him
to
wash
from
his
woolly
pate
what
had
been
intended
for
the
next
day
meal
this
is
the
farce
after
what
was
almost
a
tragedy
said
walters
as
they
ascended
the
stairs
again
i
wonder
what
we
shall
have
next
they
all
returned
to
their
chairs
by
the
fire
after
this
occurrence
and
remained
in
comparative
silence
for
some
time
until
loud
cries
of
fire
fire
startled
them
from
their
seats
the
whole
of
the
lower
part
of
the
city
appears
to
be
in
a
blaze
exclaimed
one
of
the
party
who
had
hastened
to
the
window
look
at
the
flames
they
are
ascending
from
several
places
they
are
at
their
work
we
may
expect
them
here
soon
well
they
find
us
prepared
when
they
do
come
rejoined
walters
what
do
you
propose
asked
ellis
are
we
to
fire
on
them
at
once
or
wait
for
their
attack
wait
for
their
attack
by
all
means
said
he
in
reply
if
they
throw
stones
you
find
plenty
in
that
room
with
which
to
return
the
compliment
if
they
resort
to
then
we
will
do
the
same
i
want
to
be
strictly
on
the
defensive
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
defend
ourselves
fully
and
energetically
in
about
an
hour
after
this
conversation
a
dull
roar
was
heard
in
the
distance
which
grew
louder
and
nearer
every
moment
hist
said
esther
do
you
hear
that
noise
listen
is
that
the
mob
coming
walters
opened
the
shutter
and
then
the
sound
became
more
distinct
on
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
noise
of
their
voices
became
almost
deafening
there
was
something
awful
in
the
appearance
of
the
motley
crowd
that
like
a
torrent
foamed
and
surged
through
the
streets
some
were
bearing
large
pine
torches
that
filled
the
air
with
thick
smoke
and
partially
lighted
up
the
surrounding
gloom
most
of
them
were
armed
with
clubs
and
a
few
with
guns
and
pistols
as
they
approached
the
house
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
consultation
between
the
ringleaders
for
soon
after
every
light
was
extinguished
and
the
deafening
yells
of
kill
the
niggers
down
with
the
abolitionists
were
almost
entirely
stilled
i
wonder
what
that
means
said
walters
who
had
closed
the
shutter
and
was
surveying
through
an
aperture
that
had
been
cut
the
turbulent
mass
below
look
out
for
something
soon
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
a
voice
in
the
street
cried
one
two
three
and
immediately
there
followed
a
volley
of
missiles
crushing
in
the
windows
of
the
chamber
above
and
rattling
upon
the
shutters
of
the
room
in
which
the
party
of
defenders
were
gathered
a
yell
then
went
up
from
the
mob
followed
by
another
shower
of
stones
it
is
now
our
turn
said
walters
coolly
four
of
you
place
yourselves
at
the
windows
of
the
adjoining
room
the
rest
remain
here
when
you
see
a
bright
light
reflected
on
the
crowd
below
throw
open
the
shutters
and
hurl
down
stones
as
long
as
the
light
is
shining
now
take
your
places
and
as
soon
as
you
are
prepared
stamp
upon
the
floor
each
of
the
men
now
armed
themselves
with
two
or
more
of
the
largest
stones
they
could
find
from
the
heap
that
had
been
provided
for
the
occasion
and
in
a
few
seconds
a
loud
stamping
upon
the
floor
informed
walters
that
all
was
ready
he
now
opened
the
aperture
in
the
shutter
and
placed
therein
a
powerful
reflecting
light
which
brought
the
shouting
crowd
below
clearly
into
view
and
in
an
instant
a
shower
of
heavy
stones
came
crashing
down
upon
their
upturned
faces
yells
of
rage
and
agony
ascended
from
the
throng
who
not
seeing
any
previous
signs
of
life
in
the
house
had
no
anticipation
of
so
prompt
and
severe
a
response
to
their
attack
for
a
time
they
swayed
to
and
fro
bewildered
by
the
intense
light
and
crushing
shower
of
stones
that
had
so
suddenly
fallen
upon
them
those
in
the
rear
however
pressing
forward
did
not
permit
the
most
exposed
to
retire
out
of
reach
of
missiles
from
the
house
on
perceiving
which
walters
again
turned
the
light
upon
them
and
immediately
another
stony
shower
came
rattling
down
which
caused
a
precipitate
retreat
the
house
is
full
of
niggers
the
house
is
full
of
niggers
cried
several
voices
shoot
them
kill
them
and
immediately
several
shots
were
fired
at
the
window
by
the
mob
below
do
fire
yet
said
walters
to
one
of
the
young
men
who
had
his
hand
upon
a
gun
stop
awhile
when
we
do
fire
let
it
be
to
some
purpose
let
us
make
sure
that
some
one
is
hit
whilst
they
were
talking
two
or
three
bullets
pierced
the
shutters
and
flattened
themselves
upon
the
ceiling
above
those
are
rifle
bullets
remarked
one
of
the
young
men
do
let
us
fire
it
is
too
great
a
risk
to
approach
the
windows
at
present
keep
quiet
for
a
little
while
and
when
the
light
is
shown
again
fire
but
hark
continued
he
they
are
trying
to
burst
open
the
door
we
ca
reach
them
there
without
exposing
ourselves
and
if
they
should
get
into
the
entry
it
would
be
hard
work
to
dislodge
them
let
us
give
them
a
round
probably
it
will
disperse
those
farthest
off
and
those
at
the
door
will
follow
suggested
one
of
the
young
men
we
try
it
at
any
rate
replied
walters
take
your
places
do
fire
until
i
show
the
light
then
pick
your
man
and
let
him
have
it
there
is
no
use
to
fire
you
know
unless
you
hit
somebody
are
you
ready
he
asked
yes
was
the
prompt
reply
then
here
goes
said
he
turning
the
light
upon
the
crowd
below
who
having
some
experience
in
what
would
follow
did
their
best
to
get
out
of
reach
but
they
were
too
late
for
the
appearance
of
the
light
was
followed
by
the
instantaneous
report
of
several
guns
which
did
fearful
execution
amidst
the
throng
of
ruffians
two
or
three
fell
on
the
spot
and
were
carried
off
by
their
comrades
with
fearful
execrations
the
firing
now
became
frequent
on
both
sides
and
esther
services
came
into
constant
requisition
it
was
in
vain
that
her
father
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
to
leave
the
room
notwithstanding
the
shutters
had
been
thrown
open
to
facilitate
operations
from
within
and
the
exposure
thereby
greatly
increased
she
resolutely
refused
to
retire
and
continued
fearlessly
to
load
the
guns
and
hand
them
to
the
men
they
got
axes
at
work
upon
the
door
if
they
are
not
dislodged
cut
their
way
in
exclaimed
one
of
the
young
men
the
stones
are
exhausted
and
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
just
then
the
splash
of
water
was
heard
followed
by
shrieks
of
agony
oh
god
i
scalded
i
scalded
cried
one
of
the
men
upon
the
steps
take
me
away
take
me
away
in
the
midst
of
his
cries
another
volume
of
scalding
water
came
pouring
down
upon
the
group
at
the
door
which
was
followed
by
a
rush
from
the
premises
what
is
that
who
could
have
done
that
where
has
that
water
come
from
asked
walters
as
he
saw
the
seething
shower
pass
the
window
and
fall
upon
the
heads
below
i
must
go
and
see
he
ran
upstairs
and
found
kinch
and
caddy
busy
putting
on
more
water
they
having
exhausted
one
into
which
they
had
put
two
or
three
pounds
of
cayenne
pepper
on
the
heads
of
the
crowd
below
we
gave
a
settler
did
we
mr
walters
asked
caddy
as
he
entered
the
room
it
takes
us
we
fight
with
hot
water
this
said
she
holding
up
a
dipper
is
my
gun
i
guess
we
made
squeal
you
done
well
caddy
replied
he
my
girl
i
believe
you
driven
them
off
entirely
he
continued
peeping
out
of
the
window
they
are
going
off
at
any
rate
said
he
drawing
in
his
head
whether
they
will
return
or
not
is
more
than
i
can
say
keep
plenty
of
hot
water
ready
but
do
expose
yourselves
children
were
you
afraid
to
go
to
the
window
he
asked
we
did
go
near
it
look
at
this
replied
caddy
fitting
a
broom
handle
into
the
end
of
a
very
large
tin
dipper
kinch
cut
this
to
fit
so
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
stand
back
here
dip
up
the
water
and
let
them
have
it
the
length
of
the
handle
keeps
us
from
being
seen
from
the
street
that
was
kinch
plan
and
a
capital
one
it
was
too
your
head
kinch
evidently
has
no
batter
within
if
it
has
without
there
is
a
great
deal
in
that
keep
a
bright
look
out
continued
walters
i
going
downstairs
if
they
come
again
let
them
have
plenty
of
your
warm
on
returning
to
the
walters
found
dennis
one
of
the
company
preparing
to
go
out
i
about
to
avail
myself
of
the
advantage
afforded
by
my
fair
complexion
and
play
the
spy
said
he
they
discern
at
night
what
i
am
and
i
may
be
able
to
learn
some
of
their
plans
a
most
excellent
idea
said
walters
but
pray
be
careful
you
may
meet
some
one
who
will
recognise
you
never
fear
replied
dennis
i
keep
a
bright
look
out
for
that
and
drawing
his
cap
far
down
over
his
eyes
to
screen
his
face
as
much
as
possible
he
sallied
out
into
the
street
he
had
not
been
absent
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
returned
limping
into
the
house
have
they
attacked
you
are
you
hurt
asked
the
anxious
group
by
which
he
was
surrounded
i
but
not
by
them
i
got
on
very
well
and
gleaned
a
great
deal
of
information
when
i
heard
a
sudden
exclamation
and
on
looking
round
i
found
myself
recognized
by
a
white
man
of
my
acquaintance
i
ran
immediately
and
whether
i
was
pursued
or
not
i
unable
to
say
i
had
almost
reached
here
when
my
foot
caught
in
a
grating
and
gave
my
ancle
such
a
wrench
that
i
unable
to
stand
as
he
spoke
his
face
grew
pale
from
the
suffering
the
limb
was
occasioning
i
sorry
very
sorry
he
continued
limping
to
the
sofa
i
was
going
out
again
immediately
they
intend
making
an
attack
on
garie
house
i
did
hear
his
name
mentioned
but
i
heard
one
of
the
men
who
appeared
to
be
a
ringleader
say
going
up
to
to
give
a
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
to
a
white
man
who
is
married
to
a
nigger
woman
they
can
allude
to
none
but
him
how
annoying
that
this
accident
should
have
happened
just
now
of
all
times
they
ought
to
be
warned
oh
poor
emily
cried
esther
bursting
into
tears
it
will
kill
her
i
know
it
will
she
is
so
ill
some
one
must
go
and
warn
them
let
me
try
the
mob
even
if
i
met
them
surely
would
not
assault
a
woman
you
must
think
of
such
a
thing
esther
exclaimed
walters
the
idea
is
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
you
do
know
what
ruthless
wretches
they
are
your
colour
discovered
you
would
find
your
sex
but
a
trifling
protection
i
go
but
it
would
be
certain
death
to
me
my
black
face
would
quickly
obtain
for
me
a
passport
to
another
world
if
i
were
discovered
in
the
street
just
now
i
go
calmly
spoke
ellis
i
ca
rest
here
and
think
of
what
they
are
exposed
to
by
skulking
through
and
keeping
under
the
shadows
of
houses
i
may
escape
observation
at
any
rate
i
must
run
the
risk
and
he
began
to
button
up
his
coat
do
let
your
mother
know
gone
stick
by
her
my
girl
said
he
kissing
esther
trust
in
god
he
protect
me
esther
hung
sobbing
on
her
father
neck
oh
father
father
said
she
i
could
bear
to
see
you
go
for
any
one
but
emily
and
the
children
i
know
it
dear
he
replied
it
my
duty
garie
would
do
the
same
for
me
i
know
even
at
greater
risk
and
disengaging
himself
from
the
weeping
girl
he
started
on
his
errand
of
mercy
walking
swiftly
forwards
he
passed
over
more
than
of
the
way
without
the
slightest
interruption
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
being
almost
entirely
deserted
he
had
arrived
within
a
couple
of
squares
of
the
garies
when
suddenly
on
turning
a
corner
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
gang
of
ruffians
here
a
nigger
here
a
nigger
shouted
two
or
three
of
them
almost
simultaneously
making
at
the
same
time
a
rush
at
ellis
who
turned
and
ran
followed
by
the
whole
gang
fear
lent
him
wings
and
he
fast
outstripped
his
pursuers
and
would
have
entirely
escaped
had
he
not
turned
into
a
street
which
unfortunately
was
closed
at
the
other
end
this
he
did
not
discover
until
it
was
too
late
to
retrace
his
steps
his
pursuers
having
already
entered
the
street
looking
for
some
retreat
he
perceived
he
was
standing
near
an
unfinished
building
tearing
off
the
boards
that
were
nailed
across
the
window
he
vaulted
into
the
room
knocking
off
his
hat
which
fell
upon
the
pavement
behind
him
scarcely
had
he
groped
his
way
to
the
staircase
of
the
dwelling
when
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
his
pursuers
he
ca
have
got
through
exclaimed
one
of
them
the
street
is
closed
up
at
the
end
he
must
be
up
here
somewhere
lighting
one
of
their
torches
they
began
to
look
around
them
and
soon
discovered
the
hat
lying
beneath
the
window
he
in
here
boys
we
tree
the
laughingly
exclaimed
one
of
the
ruffians
let
after
him
tearing
off
the
remainder
of
the
boards
one
or
two
entered
opened
the
door
from
the
inside
and
gave
admission
to
the
rest
ellis
mounted
to
the
second
story
followed
by
his
pursuers
on
he
went
until
he
reached
the
attic
from
which
a
ladder
led
to
the
roof
ascending
this
he
drew
it
up
after
him
and
found
himself
on
the
roof
of
a
house
that
was
entirely
isolated
the
whole
extent
of
the
danger
flashed
upon
him
at
once
here
he
was
completely
hemmed
in
without
the
smallest
chance
for
escape
he
approached
the
edge
and
looked
over
but
could
discover
nothing
near
enough
to
reach
by
a
leap
i
must
sell
my
life
dearly
he
said
god
be
my
helper
now
he
is
all
i
have
to
rely
upon
and
as
he
spoke
the
great
drops
of
sweat
fell
from
his
forehead
espying
a
sheet
of
lead
upon
the
roof
he
rolled
it
into
a
club
of
tolerable
thickness
and
waited
the
approach
of
his
pursuers
he
gone
on
the
roof
he
heard
one
of
them
exclaim
and
pulled
the
ladder
up
after
him
just
then
a
head
emerged
from
the
the
owner
of
which
perceiving
ellis
set
up
a
shout
of
triumph
we
got
him
we
got
him
here
he
is
which
cries
were
answered
by
the
exultant
voices
of
his
comrades
below
an
attempt
was
now
made
by
one
of
them
to
gain
the
roof
but
he
immediately
received
a
blow
from
ellis
that
knocked
him
senseless
into
the
arms
of
his
companions
another
attempted
the
same
feat
and
met
a
similar
fate
this
caused
a
parley
as
to
the
best
mode
of
proceeding
which
resulted
in
the
simultaneous
appearance
of
three
of
the
rioters
at
the
opening
nothing
daunted
ellis
attacked
them
with
such
fierceness
and
energy
that
they
were
forced
to
descend
muttering
the
direst
curses
in
a
few
moments
another
head
appeared
at
which
ellis
aimed
a
blow
of
great
force
and
the
club
descended
upon
a
hat
placed
upon
a
stick
not
meeting
the
resistance
expected
it
flew
from
his
hand
and
he
was
thrown
forward
nearly
falling
down
the
doorway
with
a
shout
of
triumph
they
seized
his
arm
and
held
him
firmly
until
one
or
two
of
them
mounted
the
roof
throw
him
over
throw
him
over
exclaimed
some
of
the
fiercest
of
the
crowd
one
or
two
of
the
more
merciful
endeavoured
to
interfere
against
killing
him
outright
but
the
frenzy
of
the
majority
triumphed
and
they
determined
to
cast
him
into
the
street
below
ellis
clung
to
the
chimney
shrieking
save
me
save
me
help
help
will
no
one
save
me
his
cries
were
unheeded
by
the
ruffians
and
the
people
at
the
surrounding
windows
were
unable
to
afford
him
any
assistance
even
if
they
were
disposed
to
do
so
despite
his
cries
and
resistance
they
forced
him
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
he
clinging
to
them
the
while
and
shrieking
in
agonized
terror
forcing
off
his
hold
they
thrust
him
forward
and
got
him
partially
over
the
edge
where
he
clung
calling
frantically
for
aid
one
of
the
villains
to
make
him
loose
his
hold
struck
on
his
fingers
with
the
handle
of
a
hatchet
found
on
the
roof
not
succeeding
in
breaking
his
hold
by
these
means
with
an
oath
he
struck
with
the
blade
severing
two
of
the
fingers
from
one
hand
and
deeply
mangling
the
other
with
a
yell
of
agony
ellis
let
go
his
hold
and
fell
upon
a
pile
of
rubbish
below
whilst
a
cry
of
triumphant
malignity
went
up
from
the
crowd
on
the
roof
a
gentleman
and
some
of
his
friends
kindly
carried
the
insensible
man
into
his
house
poor
fellow
said
he
he
is
killed
i
believe
what
a
gang
of
wretches
these
things
are
dreadful
that
such
a
thing
can
be
permitted
in
a
christian
city
is
perfectly
appalling
the
family
gathered
around
the
mangled
form
of
ellis
and
gave
vent
to
loud
expressions
of
sympathy
a
doctor
was
quickly
sent
for
who
stanched
the
blood
that
was
flowing
from
his
hands
and
head
i
do
think
he
can
live
said
he
the
fall
was
too
great
as
far
as
i
can
judge
his
legs
and
two
of
his
ribs
are
broken
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
get
him
conveyed
to
the
hospital
look
in
his
pockets
perhaps
we
can
find
out
who
he
is
there
was
nothing
found
however
that
afforded
the
least
clue
to
his
name
and
residence
and
he
was
therefore
as
soon
as
persons
could
be
procured
to
assist
borne
to
the
hospital
where
his
wounds
were
dressed
and
the
broken
limbs
set
chapter
xxi
more
horrors
unaware
of
the
impending
danger
garie
sat
watching
by
the
bedside
of
his
wife
she
had
been
quite
ill
but
on
the
evening
of
which
we
write
although
nervous
and
wakeful
was
much
better
the
bleak
winds
of
the
fast
approaching
winter
dealt
unkindly
with
her
delicate
frame
accustomed
as
she
was
to
the
soft
breezes
of
her
southern
home
garie
had
been
sitting
up
looking
at
the
fires
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
not
having
been
out
all
that
day
or
the
one
previous
he
knew
nothing
of
the
fearful
state
into
which
matters
had
fallen
those
lights
are
dying
away
my
dear
said
he
to
his
wife
there
must
have
been
quite
an
extensive
conflagration
taking
out
his
watch
he
continued
almost
two
why
how
late
i
been
sitting
up
i
really
do
know
whether
it
worth
while
to
go
to
bed
or
not
i
should
be
obliged
to
get
up
again
at
five
i
go
to
new
york
or
rather
there
are
some
matters
connected
with
uncle
john
will
that
require
my
personal
attention
dear
old
man
how
suddenly
he
died
i
wish
dear
you
could
put
off
your
journey
until
i
am
better
said
garie
faintly
i
do
hate
you
to
go
just
now
i
would
if
i
could
emily
but
it
is
impossible
i
shall
be
back
or
the
next
day
at
farthest
whilst
i
there
i
hush
interrupted
garie
stop
a
moment
do
you
hear
a
noise
like
the
shouting
of
a
great
many
people
oh
it
only
the
firemen
replied
he
as
i
was
about
to
observe
hush
cried
she
again
listen
now
that
do
sound
like
the
firemen
in
the
least
garie
paused
as
the
sound
of
a
number
of
voices
became
more
distinct
wrapping
his
more
closely
about
him
he
walked
into
the
front
room
which
overlooked
the
street
opening
the
window
he
saw
a
number
of
men
some
bearing
torches
coming
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
his
dwelling
i
wonder
what
all
this
is
for
what
can
it
mean
he
exclaimed
they
had
now
approached
sufficiently
near
for
him
to
understand
their
cries
down
with
the
abolitionist
down
with
the
amalgamationist
give
them
tar
and
feathers
it
a
mob
and
that
word
amalgamationist
can
it
be
pointed
at
me
it
hardly
seems
possible
and
yet
i
have
a
fear
that
there
is
something
wrong
what
is
it
garie
what
is
the
matter
asked
his
wife
who
with
a
shawl
hastily
thrown
across
her
shoulders
was
standing
pale
and
trembling
by
the
window
go
in
emily
my
dear
for
heaven
sake
you
get
your
death
of

come
and
tell

in
garie
retired
a
few
feet
from
the
window
and
stood
listening
to
the
shouts
in
the
street
the
rioters
led
on
evidently
by
some
one
who
knew
what
he
was
about
pressed
forward
to
garie
house
and
soon
the
garden
in
front
was
filled
with
the
shouting
crowd
what
do

all
want
why
are
you
on
my
premises

garie

against

a

a

in
the
crowd

and

that
the
talk
ai
it
boys
a
general
shout
of
approval
answered
this
speech
and
several
stones
were
thrown
at
garie
one
of
which
struck
him
on
the
breast
seeing
the
utter
futility
of
attempting
to
parley
with
the
infuriated
wretches
below
he
ran
into
the
room
exclaiming
put
on
some
clothes
emily
shoes

life

are
attacked
by
a
mob
of
demons
hurry
emily
do
for
god
sake
garie
aroused
the
sleeping
children
and
threw
some
clothes
upon
them
over
which
he
wrapped
shawls
or
blankets
or
whatever
came
to
hand
rushing
into
the
next
room
he
snatched
a
pair
of
loaded
pistols
from
the
drawer
of
his
and
then
hurried
his
terrified
wife
and
children
down
the
stairs
this
way
dear
this
way
he
cried
leading
on
toward
the
back
door
out
that
way
through
the
gate
with
the
children
and
into
some
of
the
neighbour
houses
i
stand
here
to
keep
the
way
no
no
garie
she
replied
frantically
i
wo
go
without
you
you
must
he
cried
stamping
his
foot
impatiently
this
is
no
time
to
parley
go
or
we
shall
all
be
murdered
listen
they
broken
in
the
door
quick
quick
go
on
and
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
her
and
the
children
out
of
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
them
garie
ran
down
the
garden
followed
by
the
children
to
her
horror
she
found
the
gate
locked
and
the
key
nowhere
to
be
found
what
shall
we
do
she
cried
oh
we
shall
all
be
killed
and
her
limbs
trembled
beneath
her
with
cold
and
terror
let
us
hide
in
here
mother
suggested
clarence
running
toward
the
we
be
safe
in
there
seeing
that
nothing
better
could
be
done
garie
availed
herself
of
the
suggestion
and
when
she
was
fairly
inside
the
place
fell
fainting
upon
the
ground
as
she
escaped
through
the
back
door
the
mob
broke
in
at
the
front
and
were
confronting
garie
as
he
stood
with
his
pistol
pointed
at
them
prepared
to
fire
come
another
step
forward
and
i
fire
exclaimed
he
resolutely
but
those
in
the
rear
urged
the
advance
of
those
in
front
who
approached
cautiously
nearer
and
nearer
their
victim
fearful
of
opening
the
door
behind
him
lest
he
should
show
the
way
taken
by
his
retreating
wife
he
stood
uncertain
how
to
act
a
severe
blow
from
a
stone
however
made
him
lose
all
reflection
and
he
immediately
fired
a
loud
shriek
followed
the
report
of
his
pistol
and
a
shower
of
stones
was
immediately
hurled
upon
him
he
quickly
fired
again
and
was
endeavouring
to
open
the
door
to
effect
his
escape
when
a
pistol
was
discharged
close
to
his
head
and
he
fell
forward
on
the
entry
floor
lifeless
all
this
transpired
in
a
few
moments
and
in
the
of
the
entry
rushing
forward
over
his
lifeless
form
the
villains
hastened
upstairs
in
search
of
garie
they
ran
shouting
through
the
house
stealing
everything
valuable
that
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
and
wantonly
destroying
the
furniture
they
would
have
fired
the
house
but
were
prevented
by
mccloskey
who
acted
as
leader
of
the
gang
for
two
long
hours
they
ransacked
the
house
breaking
all
they
could
not
carry
off
drinking
the
wine
in
garie
cellar
and
shouting
and
screaming
like
so
many
fiends
garie
and
the
children
lay
crouching
with
terror
in
the
listening
to
the
ruffians
as
they
went
through
the
yard
cursing
her
and
her
husband
and
uttering
the
direst
threats
of
what
they
would
do
should
she
fall
into
their
hands
once
she
almost
fainted
on
hearing
one
of
them
propose
opening
the
to
see
if
there
was
anything
of
value
in
it
but
breathed
again
when
they
abandoned
it
as
not
worth
their
attention
the
children
crouched
down
beside
her
scarcely
daring
to
whisper
lest
they
should
attract
the
attention
of
their
persecutors
shivering
with
cold
they
drew
closer
around
them
the
blanket
with
which
they
had
been
providentially
provided
brother
my
feet
are
cold
sobbed
little
em
i
ca
feel
my
toes
oh
i
so
cold
put
your
feet
closer
to
me
sissy
answered
her
brother
baring
himself
to
enwrap
her
more
thoroughly
put
my
stockings
on
over
yours
and
as
well
as
they
were
able
in
the
dark
he
drew
his
stockings
on
over
her
benumbed
feet
there
sis
that
better
he
whispered
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
now
you
be
warmer
just
then
clarence
heard
a
groan
from
his
mother
so
loud
indeed
that
it
would
have
been
heard
without
but
for
the
noise
and
excitement
around
the
house
and
feeling
for
her
in
the
dark
he
asked
mother
are
you
worse
are
you
sick
a
groan
was
her
only
answer
mother
mother
he
whispered
do
speak
please
do
and
he
endeavoured
to
put
his
arm
around
her
do
dear
do
said
she
faintly
just
take
care
of
your
sister
you
ca
do
me
any
good
do
speak
dear
the
men
will
hear
you
reluctantly
the
frightened
child
turned
his
attention
again
to
his
little
sister
ever
and
anon
suppressed
groans
from
his
mother
would
reach
his
ears
at
last
he
heard
a
groan
even
fierce
in
its
intensity
and
then
the
sounds
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
entirely
ceased
the
night
to
the
poor
shivering
creatures
in
their
hiding
place
seemed
interminably
long
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
house
had
not
long
ceased
when
the
faint
light
of
day
pierced
their
cheerless
shelter
hearing
the
voices
of
some
neighbours
in
the
yard
clarence
hastened
out
and
seizing
one
of
the
ladies
by
the
dress
cried
imploringly
do
come
to
my
mother
she
sick
why
where
did
you
come
from
chil
said
the
lady
with
a
start
of
astonishment
where
have
you
been
in
there
he
answered
pointing
to
the
mother
and
sister
are
in
there
the
lady
accompanied
by
one
or
two
others
hastened
to
the
where
is
she
asked
the
foremost
for
in
the
gloom
of
the
place
she
could
not
perceive
anything
here
replied
clarence
she
lying
here
on
opening
a
small
window
they
saw
garie
lying
in
a
corner
stretched
upon
the
boards
her
head
supported
by
some
blocks
she
asleep
said
clarence
mother
mother
but
there
came
no
answer
mother
said
he
still
louder
but
yet
there
was
no
response
stepping
forward
one
of
the
females
opened
the
shawl
which
was
held
firmly
in
the
clenched
hands
of
garie
and
there
in
her
lap
partially
covered
by
her
scanty
nightdress
was
discovered
a
babe
who
with
its
mother
had
journeyed
in
the
darkness
cold
and
night
to
the
better
land
that
they
might
pour
out
their
woes
upon
the
bosom
of
their
creator
the
women
gazed
in
mournful
silence
on
the
touching
scene
before
them
clarence
was
on
his
knees
regarding
with
fear
and
wonder
the
unnatural
stillness
of
his
mother
the
child
had
never
before
looked
on
death
and
could
not
recognize
its
presence
laying
his
hand
on
her
cold
cheek
he
cried
with
faltering
voice
mother
you
speak
but
there
was
no
answering
light
in
the
fixed
stare
of
those
glassy
eyes
and
the
lips
of
the
dead
could
not
move
why
do
she
speak
he
asked
she
ca
my
dear
you
must
come
away
and
leave
her
she
better
off
my
darling
she
then
there
was
a
cry
of
grief
sprung
up
from
the
heart
of
that
orphan
boy
that
rang
in
those
women
ears
for
long
years
after
it
was
the
first
outbreak
of
a
loving
childish
heart
pierced
with
life
bitterest
grief
a
mother
loss
the
two
children
were
kindly
taken
into
the
house
of
some
benevolent
neighbour
as
the
servants
had
all
fled
none
knew
whither
little
em
was
in
a
profound
stupor
the
result
of
cold
and
terror
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
place
her
under
the
care
of
a
physician
after
they
had
all
gone
an
inquest
was
held
by
the
coroner
and
a
very
unsatisfactory
and
untruthful
verdict
pronounced
one
that
did
not
at
all
coincide
with
the
circumstances
of
the
case
but
such
a
one
as
might
have
been
expected
where
there
was
a
great
desire
to
screen
the
affair
from
public
scrutiny
chapter
xxii
an
anxious
day
esther
ellis
devoured
with
anxiety
respecting
the
safety
of
her
father
and
the
garies
paced
with
impatient
step
up
and
down
the
opening
the
window
she
looked
to
see
if
she
could
discover
any
signs
of
day
pitchy
dark
she
exclaimed
and
yet
almost
five
father
has
run
a
fearful
risk
i
hope
nothing
has
happened
to
him
i
trust
not
i
think
he
safe
enough
somewhere
said
walters
no
doubt
been
very
cautious
and
avoided
meeting
any
one
do
worry
yourself
my
child
is
most
likely
he
remained
with
them
wherever
they
went
probably
they
are
at
the
house
of
some
of
their
neighbours
i
ca
help
feeling
dreadfully
oppressed
and
anxious
continued
she
i
wish
he
would
come
whilst
she
was
speaking
her
mother
entered
the
room
any
news
of
your
father
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
anxiety
esther
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
own
apprehensions
and
rejoined
in
as
cheerful
tone
as
she
could
assume
not
yet
mother
it
too
dark
for
us
to
expect
him
yet
he
remain
most
likely
until
daylight
he
should
have
gone
had
i
been
here
he
no
business
to
expose
himself
in
this
way
but
mother
interrupted
esther
only
think
of
it
the
safety
of
emily
and
the
children
were
depending
on
it
we
must
be
selfish
i
know
we
ought
to
be
my
child
rejoined
her
mother
but
natural
to
the
best
of
us
sometimes
we
ca
help
it
five
six
seven
came
and
passed
and
still
there
were
no
tidings
of
ellis
i
can
bear
this
suspense
no
longer
exclaimed
esther
if
father
come
soon
i
shall
go
and
look
for
him
i
tried
to
flatter
myself
that
he
safe
but
i
almost
convinced
now
that
something
has
happened
to
him
or
he
have
come
back
long
before
this
he
knows
how
anxious
we
would
all
be
about
him
i
tried
to
quiet
mother
and
caddy
by
suggesting
various
reasons
for
his
delay
but
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
but
cherish
the
most
dismal
forebodings
i
must
go
and
look
for
him
no
no
esther
stay
where
you
are
at
present
leave
that
to
me
order
a
carriage
and
go
up
to
garie
immediately
well
do
walters
and
hurry
back
wo
you
she
rejoined
as
he
left
the
apartment
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
prepared
to
start
and
was
speedily
driven
to
he
found
a
group
of
people
gathered
before
the
gate
gazing
into
the
house
the
place
has
been
attacked
said
he
as
he
walked
towards
the
front
door
picking
his
way
amidst
fragments
of
furniture
straw
and
broken
glass
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
he
was
met
by
balch
garie
lawyer
this
is
a
shocking
affair
walters
said
he
extending
his
hand
he
was
an
old
friend
of
walters
very
shocking
indeed
he
replied
looking
around
but
where
is
garie
we
sent
to
warn
them
of
this
i
hope
they
are
all
safe
safe
repeated
balch
with
an
air
of
astonishment
why
man
you
heard
heard
what
asked
walters
looking
alarmed
that
and
garie
are
dead
both
were
killed
last
night
the
shock
of
this
sudden
and
totally
unexpected
disclosure
was
such
that
walters
leaned
against
the
doorway
for
support
it
ca
be
possible
he
exclaimed
at
last
not
dead
yes
i
regret
to
say
he
was
shot
through
the
head
and
she
died
in
the
of
premature
confinement
brought
on
by
fright
and
exposure
and
the
children
gasped
walters
they
are
safe
with
some
neighbours
it
to
hear
them
weeping
for
their
mother
here
a
tear
glistened
in
the
eye
of
balch
and
ran
down
his
cheek
brushing
it
off
he
continued
the
coroner
has
just
held
an
inquest
and
they
gave
a
most
truthless
verdict
nothing
whatever
is
said
of
the
cause
of
the
murder
or
of
the
murderers
they
simply
rendered
a
verdict
death
caused
by
a
wound
from
a
and
hers
death
from
exposure
there
seemed
the
greatest
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
coroner
to
get
the
matter
over
as
quickly
as
possible
and
few
or
no
witnesses
were
examined
but
i
determined
to
sift
the
matter
to
the
bottom
if
the
perpetrators
of
the
murder
can
be
discovered
i
leave
no
means
untried
to
find
them
do
you
know
any
one
who
sat
on
the
inquest
asked
walters
yes
one
was
the
reply
slippery
george
the
lawyer
you
are
acquainted
with
him
george
stevens
i
find
he
resides
next
door
do
you
know
here
interrupted
walters
that
i
my
suspicions
that
that
villain
is
at
the
bottom
of
these
disturbances
or
at
least
has
a
large
share
in
them
i
have
a
paper
in
my
possession
in
his
handwriting
it
is
in
fact
a
list
of
the
places
destroyed
by
the
mob
last
night
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
friend
of
mine
by
accident
he
gave
it
to
me
it
put
me
on
my
guard
and
when
the
villains
attacked
my
house
last
night
they
got
rather
a
warmer
reception
than
they
bargained
for
you
astonish
me
is
it
possible
your
place
was
assaulted
also
asked
balch
indeed
it
was
and
a
hot
battle
we
had
of
it
for
a
short
space
of
time
but
how
did
you
hear
of
this
affair
i
was
sent
for
by
i
ca
tell
whom
when
i
came
and
saw
what
had
happened
i
immediately
set
about
searching
for
a
will
that
i
made
for
garie
a
few
weeks
since
it
was
witnessed
and
signed
at
my
office
and
he
brought
it
away
with
him
i
ca
discover
it
anywhere
i
ransacked
every
cranny
it
must
have
been
carried
off
by
some
one
you
are
named
in
it
conjointly
with
myself
as
executor
all
the
property
is
left
to
her
poor
thing
and
his
children
we
must
endeavour
to
find
it
somewhere
at
any
rate
the
children
are
secure
they
are
the
only
heirs
he
had
not
to
my
knowledge
a
single
white
relative
but
let
us
go
in
and
see
the
bodies
they
walked
together
into
the
back
room
where
the
bodies
were
lying
garie
was
stretched
upon
the
sofa
covered
with
a
piano
cloth
and
her
husband
was
laid
upon
a
long
table
with
a
silk
thrown
across
his
face
the
two
gazed
in
silence
on
the
face
of
garie
the
brow
was
still
knit
the
eyes
staring
vacantly
and
the
marble
whiteness
of
the
face
unbroken
save
by
a
few
gouts
of
blood
near
a
small
blue
spot
over
the
eye
where
the
bullet
had
entered
he
was
the
creature
in
the
world
said
walters
as
he
the
face
wo
you
look
at
her
asked
balch
no
no
i
ca
continued
walters
i
seen
horrors
enough
for
one
morning
i
another
thing
on
my
mind
a
friend
who
assisted
in
the
defence
of
my
house
started
up
here
last
night
to
warn
them
of
their
danger
and
when
i
left
home
he
had
not
returned
it
evident
he
been
here
and
i
greatly
fear
some
misfortune
has
befallen
him
where
are
the
children
poor
little
orphans
i
must
see
them
before
i
go
accompanied
by
balch
he
called
at
the
house
where
clarence
and
em
had
found
temporary
shelter
the
children
ran
to
him
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
oh
walters
sobbed
clarence
my
mother
dead
my
dead
hush
dears
hush
he
replied
endeavouring
to
restrain
his
own
tears
as
he
took
little
em
in
his
arms
do
cry
my
darling
said
he
as
she
gave
rent
to
a
fresh
outburst
of
tears
oh
mr
walters
said
she
still
sobbing
she
was
all
the
mother
i
had
balch
here
endeavoured
to
assist
in
pacifying
the
two
little
mourners
why
do
father
come
asked
clarence
have
you
seen
him
mr
walters
walters
was
quite
taken
aback
by
this
inquiry
which
clearly
showed
that
the
children
were
still
unaware
of
the
extent
of
their
misfortunes
i
seen
him
my
child
said
he
evasively
you
see
him
before
long
and
fearful
of
further
questioning
he
left
the
house
promising
soon
to
return
unable
longer
to
endure
her
anxiety
respecting
her
father
esther
determined
not
to
await
the
return
of
walters
which
had
already
been
greatly
delayed
but
to
go
herself
in
search
of
him
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
instead
of
returning
from
the
garies
direct
to
them
he
had
probably
gone
to
his
own
home
to
see
if
it
had
been
disturbed
during
the
night
encouraged
by
this
idea
without
consulting
any
one
she
hastily
put
on
her
cloak
and
bonnet
and
took
the
direction
of
her
home
numbers
of
people
were
wending
their
way
to
the
lower
part
of
the
city
to
gratify
their
curiosity
by
gazing
upon
the
havoc
made
by
the
rioters
during
the
past
night
esther
found
her
home
a
heap
of
smoking
ruins
some
of
the
neighbours
who
recognized
her
gathered
round
expressing
their
sympathy
and
regret
but
she
seemed
comparatively
careless
respecting
the
loss
of
their
property
and
in
answer
to
their
kind
expressions
could
only
ask
have
you
seen
my
father
do
you
know
where
my
father
is
none
however
had
seen
him
and
after
gazing
for
a
short
time
upon
the
ruins
of
what
was
once
a
happy
home
she
turned
mournfully
away
and
walked
back
to
walters
has
father
come
she
inquired
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
not
yet
was
the
discouraging
reply
and
walters
he
has
come
back
either
miss
esther
stood
for
some
moments
hesitating
whether
to
go
in
or
to
proceed
in
her
search
the
voice
of
her
mother
calling
her
from
the
stairway
decided
her
and
she
went
in
ellis
and
caddy
wept
freely
on
learning
from
esther
the
destruction
of
their
home
this
cause
of
grief
added
to
the
anxiety
produced
by
the
prolonged
absence
of
ellis
rendered
them
truly
miserable
whilst
they
were
condoling
with
one
another
walters
returned
he
was
unable
to
conceal
his
fears
that
something
had
happened
to
ellis
and
frankly
told
them
so
he
also
gave
a
detailed
account
of
what
had
befallen
the
garies
to
the
great
horror
and
grief
of
all
as
soon
as
arrangements
could
be
made
walters
and
esther
set
out
in
search
of
her
father
all
day
long
they
went
from
place
to
place
but
gained
no
tidings
of
him
and
weary
and
disheartened
they
returned
at
night
bringing
with
them
the
distressing
intelligence
of
their
utter
failure
to
procure
any
information
respecting
him
chapter
xxiii
the
lost
one
found
on
the
day
succeeding
the
events
described
in
our
last
chapter
walters
called
upon
balch
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
interment
of
and
garie
i
think
said
balch
we
had
better
bury
them
in
the
cemetery
it
a
lovely
spot
all
my
people
are
buried
there
the
place
is
fine
enough
i
acknowledge
rejoined
walters
but
i
much
doubt
if
you
can
procure
the
necessary
ground
oh
yes
you
can
said
balch
there
are
a
number
of
lots
still
unappropriated
that
may
very
likely
be
so
but
are
you
sure
we
can
get
one
if
we
apply
of
course
we
can
what
is
to
prevent
asked
balch
you
forget
replied
walters
that
garie
was
a
coloured
woman
if
it
was
such
a
solemn
subject
i
really
should
be
obliged
to
laugh
at
you
walters
rejoined
balch
with
a
smile
you
talk
ridiculously
what
can
her
complexion
have
to
do
with
her
being
buried
there
i
should
like
to
know
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
can
it
be
possible
you
are
not
aware
that
they
wo
even
permit
a
coloured
person
to
walk
through
the
ground
much
less
to
be
buried
there
you
astonish
me
walters
are
you
sure
of
it
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
it
is
so
but
why
should
you
be
astonished
at
such
treatment
of
the
dead
when
you
see
how
they
conduct
themselves
towards
the
living
i
have
a
friend
continued
walters
who
purchased
a
pew
for
himself
and
family
in
a
and
the
deacons
actually
removed
the
floor
from
under
it
to
prevent
his
sitting
there
they
refuse
us
permission
to
kneel
by
the
side
of
the
white
communicants
at
the
lord
supper
and
give
us
separate
pews
in
obscure
corners
of
their
churches
all
this
you
know
why
then
be
surprised
that
they
carry
their
prejudices
into
their
graveyards
the
conduct
is
all
of
a
piece
well
walters
i
know
the
way
things
are
conducted
in
our
churches
is
exceedingly
reprehensible
but
i
really
did
not
know
they
stretched
their
prejudices
to
such
an
extent
i
assure
you
they
do
then
resumed
walters
and
in
this
very
matter
you
find
i
correct
ask
stormley
the
undertaker
and
hear
what
tell
you
oh
a
case
in
about
six
months
ago
one
of
our
wealthiest
citizens
lost
by
death
an
old
family
servant
a
coloured
woman
a
sort
of
she
resembled
him
so
much
that
it
was
generally
believed
she
was
his
sister
well
he
tried
to
have
her
laid
in
their
family
vault
and
it
was
refused
the
directors
thought
it
would
be
creating
a
bad
precedent
they
said
as
they
would
not
sell
lots
to
coloured
persons
they
could
consistently
permit
them
to
be
buried
in
those
of
the
whites
then
must
be
abandoned
and
in
lieu
of
that
what
can
you
propose
asked
balch
i
should
say
we
ca
do
better
than
lay
them
in
the
graveyard
of
the
coloured
episcopal
church
let
it
be
there
then
you
will
see
to
the
arrangements
walters
i
shall
have
enough
on
my
hands
for
the
present
searching
for
that
will
i
have
already
offered
a
large
reward
for
it
i
trust
it
may
turn
up
yet
perhaps
it
may
rejoined
walters
we
must
hope
so
at
least
brought
the
children
to
my
house
where
they
are
under
the
care
of
a
young
lady
who
was
a
great
friend
of
their
mother
though
it
seems
like
putting
too
much
upon
the
poor
young
creature
to
throw
them
upon
her
for
consolation
when
she
is
almost
distracted
with
her
own
griefs
i
think
i
mentioned
to
you
yesterday
that
her
father
is
missing
and
to
add
to
their
anxieties
their
property
has
been
all
destroyed
by
the
rioters
they
have
a
home
with
me
for
the
present
and
may
remain
there
as
long
as
they
please
oh
i
remember
you
told
me
something
of
them
yesterday
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
saw
in
the
journal
this
morning
that
a
coloured
man
was
lying
at
the
hospital
very
much
injured
whose
name
they
could
not
ascertain
can
it
be
possible
that
he
is
the
man
you
are
in
search
of
let
me
see
the
article
asked
walters
balch
handed
him
the
paper
and
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
question
i
go
immediately
to
the
hospital
said
he
as
he
finished
reading
and
see
if
it
is
my
poor
friend
i
have
great
fears
that
it
is
excuse
my
leaving
so
abruptly
i
must
be
off
immediately
on
hastening
to
the
hospital
walters
arrived
just
in
time
to
be
admitted
to
the
wards
and
on
being
shown
the
person
whose
name
they
had
been
unable
to
discover
he
immediately
recognized
his
friend
ellis
my
poor
fellow
he
exclaimed
springing
forward
stop
stop
cried
the
attendant
laying
his
hand
upon
shoulder
he
is
hovering
between
life
and
death
the
least
agitation
might
be
fatal
to
him
the
doctor
says
if
he
survives
the
night
he
may
probably
get
better
but
he
has
small
chance
of
life
i
hardly
think
he
will
last
twelve
hours
more
he
been
dreadfully
beaten
there
are
two
or
three
gashes
on
his
head
his
leg
is
broken
and
his
hands
have
been
so
much
cut
that
the
surgeon
thinks
they
never
be
of
any
use
to
him
even
if
he
recovers
what
awful
intelligence
for
his
family
said
walters
they
are
already
half
distracted
about
him
ellis
lay
perfectly
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
around
him
and
his
moans
were
deeply
affecting
to
hear
unable
to
move
but
one
limb
he
was
the
picture
of
helplessness
and
misery
it
time
to
close
we
do
permit
visitors
to
remain
after
this
hour
said
the
attendant
come
you
can
see
your
friend
and
remain
longer
with
him
and
bidding
walters
good
morning
he
ushered
him
from
the
ward
how
shall
i
ever
find
means
to
break
this
to
the
girls
and
their
mother
said
he
as
he
left
the
gates
of
the
hospital
it
will
almost
kill
them
really
i
do
know
what
i
shall
say
to
them
he
walked
homeward
with
hesitating
steps
and
on
arriving
at
his
house
he
paused
awhile
before
the
door
mustering
up
courage
to
enter
at
last
he
opened
it
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
a
disagreeable
duty
to
perform
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
through
with
it
tell
miss
ellis
to
come
to
the
said
he
to
the
servant
merely
say
she
wanted
do
say
i
returned
he
waited
but
a
few
moments
before
esther
made
her
appearance
looking
sad
and
anxious
oh
it
you
she
said
with
some
surprise
you
have
news
of
father
yes
esther
i
have
news
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
not
of
a
pleasant
character
oh
walters
nothing
serious
i
hope
has
happened
to
him
she
asked
in
an
agitated
tone
i
sorry
to
say
there
has
esther
he
has
met
with
an
accident
a
sad
and
severe
one
he
been
badly
wounded
esther
turned
deadly
pale
at
this
announcement
and
leaned
upon
the
table
for
support
i
sent
for
you
esther
continued
walters
in
preference
to
your
mother
because
i
knew
you
to
be
courageous
in
danger
and
i
trusted
you
would
be
equally
so
in
misfortune
your
father
case
is
a
very
critical
one
very
it
appears
that
after
leaving
here
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
rioters
by
whom
he
was
shockingly
beaten
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
where
he
now
remains
oh
let
me
go
to
him
at
once
do
walters
my
dear
child
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
see
him
it
is
long
past
the
visiting
hour
moreover
i
do
think
him
in
a
state
that
would
permit
the
least
agitation
you
can
go
with
me
esther
did
not
weep
her
heart
was
too
full
for
tears
with
a
pale
face
and
trembling
lips
she
said
to
walters
god
give
us
strength
to
bear
up
under
these
misfortunes
we
are
homeless
almost
beggars
our
friends
have
been
murdered
and
my
father
is
now
trembling
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
such
troubles
as
these
said
she
sinking
into
a
chair
are
enough
to
crush
any
one
i
know
it
esther
i
know
it
my
child
i
sympathize
with
you
deeply
all
that
i
have
is
at
your
disposal
you
may
command
me
in
anything
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
respecting
the
future
of
your
mother
and
family
let
the
result
to
your
father
be
what
it
may
always
bear
in
mind
that
next
to
god
i
am
your
best
friend
i
speak
thus
frankly
to
you
esther
because
i
would
not
have
you
cherish
any
hopes
of
your
father
recovery
from
his
appearance
i
should
say
there
is
but
little
if
any
i
leave
to
you
my
good
girl
the
task
of
breaking
this
sad
news
to
your
mother
and
sister
i
would
tell
them
but
i
must
confess
esther
i
not
equal
to
it
the
events
of
the
last
day
or
two
have
almost
overpowered
me
esther
lips
quivered
again
as
she
repeated
the
words
little
hope
did
the
doctor
say
that
she
asked
i
did
not
see
the
doctor
replied
he
perhaps
there
may
be
a
favourable
change
during
the
night
i
have
you
prepare
for
the
worst
whilst
you
hope
for
the
best
go
now
and
try
to
break
it
as
gently
as
possible
to
your
mother
esther
left
the
room
with
heavy
step
and
walked
to
the
chamber
where
her
mother
was
sitting
caddy
also
was
there
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
chair
in
an
earnest
endeavour
to
soothe
to
sleep
little
em
who
was
sitting
in
her
lap

asked
her
mother
walters
she
hesitatingly
answered

he
heard
anything

your
father
she
asked
anxiously
esther
turned
away
her
head
and
remained
silent
why
do
you

asked
her
mother
with
an
alarmed
look
if
you
know
anything
of
him
for
god
sake

me

it
may
be
it
be
worse
than
i
expect

turn
you
must
all
make
up
your
minds
to
remain
with
me
for
ever
if
you
like
for
the
present
whether
you
like
it
or
not
i
going
to
be
dreadfully
obstinate
and
have
my
own
way
completely
about
the
matter
here
i
a
large
house
furnished
from
top
to
bottom
with
every
comfort
often
i
wandered
through
it
and
thought
myself
a
selfish
old
fellow
to
be
surrounded
with
so
much
luxury
and
keep
it
entirely
to
myself
god
has
blessed
me
with
abundance
and
to
what
better
use
can
it
be
appropriated
than
the
relief
of
my
friends
now
ellen
you
shall
superintend
the
whole
of
the
establishment
esther
shall
nurse
her
father
caddy
shall
stir
up
the
servants
and
i
look
on
and
find
my
happiness
in
seeing
you
all
happy
now
what
objection
can
you
urge
against
that
arrangement
concluded
he
triumphantly
why
we
shall
put
you
to
great
inconvenience
and
place
ourselves
under
an
obligation
we
can
never
repay
answered
ellis
do
despair
of
that
never
mind
the
obligation
try
and
be
as
cheerful
as
you
can
we
shall
see
ellis
and
perhaps
find
him
better
let
us
at
least
hope
for
the
best
esther
looked
with
grateful
admiration
at
walters
as
he
left
the
room
what
a
good
heart
he
has
mother
said
she
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
just
such
a
great
tender
heart
as
one
should
expect
to
find
in
so
fine
a
form
ellis
and
her
daughters
were
the
first
who
were
found
next
day
at
the
office
of
the
doorkeeper
of
the
hospital
waiting
an
opportunity
to
see
their
sick
friends
you
early
said
a
little
official
who
sat
at
his
desk
fronting
the
door
take
a
chair
near
the
fire
it
dreadful
cold
this
morning
very
cold
replied
esther
taking
a
seat
beside
her
mother
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
can
go
in
oh
you
good
an
hour
to
wait
the
doctor
has
come
yet
replied
the
how
is
my
husband
tremblingly
inquired
ellis
who
is
your
husband
you
do
know
his
number
do
you
never
know
names
here
go
by
numbers
we
do
know
the
number
rejoined
esther
my
father
name
is
ellis
he
was
brought
here
two
or
three
nights
since
he
was
beaten
by
the
mob
oh
yes
i
know
now
who
you
mean
number
sixty
bad
case
that
shocking
bad
case
hands
chopped
head
smashed
leg
broke
he
have
to
cross
over
i
guess
make
a
die
of
it
i
afraid
ellis
shuddered
and
turned
pale
as
the
man
coolly
discussed
her
husband
injuries
and
their
probable
fatal
termination
caddy
observing
her
agitation
said
please
sir
do
talk
of
it
mother
ca
bear
it
the
man
looked
at
them
compassionately
for
a
few
moments
then
continued
you
must
think
me
i
see
so
much
of
these
things
that
i
ca
feel
them
as
others
do
this
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
you
no
doubt
but
it
an
song
to
me
people
are
always
coming
here
mangled
in
all
sorts
of
ways
so
you
see
i
got
used
to
it
in
fact
i
rather
miss
now
if
they
did
come
i
sat
in
this
seat
every
day
for
almost
twenty
years
and
he
looked
on
the
girls
and
their
mother
as
he
gave
them
this
piece
of
information
as
if
he
thought
they
ought
to
regard
him
henceforth
with
great
reverence
not
finding
them
disposed
to
converse
the
doorkeeper
resumed
the
newspaper
he
was
reading
when
they
entered
and
was
soon
deeply
engrossed
in
a
horrible
accident
the
sound
of
wheels
in
the
courtyard
attracting
his
attention
he
looked
up
and
remarked
here
the
doctor
as
soon
as
he
has
walked
the
wards
you
be
admitted
ellis
and
her
daughters
turned
round
as
the
door
opened
and
to
their
great
joy
recognized
doctor
burdett
how
d
do
said
he
extending
his
hand
to
ellis
what
the
matter
crying
he
continued
looking
at
their
tearful
faces
what
has
happened
oh
doctor
said
esther
father
lying
here
very
much
injured
and
they
think
he
die
said
she
giving
way
to
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
very
much
injured
die
how
is
this
i
knew
nothing
of
it
i
have
been
here
before
this
week
esther
hereupon
briefly
related
the
misfortunes
that
had
befallen
her
father
dear
me
dear
me
repeated
the
kind
old
doctor
there
my
dear
do
fret
he
get
better
my
child
i
take
him
in
hand
at
once
my
dear
ellis
weeping
wo
do
the
least
good
and
only
make
you
sick
yourself
stop
do
now
i
go
and
see
him
immediately
and
as
soon
as
possible
you
shall
be
admitted
they
had
not
long
to
wait
before
a
message
came
from
doctor
burdett
informing
them
that
they
could
now
be
permitted
to
see
the
sufferer
you
must
control
yourselves
said
the
doctor
to
the
sobbing
women
as
he
met
them
at
the
door
you
must
do
anything
to
agitate
him
his
situation
is
extremely
critical
the
girls
and
their
mother
followed
him
to
the
bedside
of
ellis
who
ghastly
pale
lay
before
them
apparently
unconscious
ellis
gave
but
one
look
at
her
husband
and
with
a
faint
cry
sank
fainting
upon
the
floor
the
noise
partially
aroused
him
he
turned
his
head
and
after
an
apparent
effort
recognized
his
daughters
standing
beside
him
he
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
raise
his
mutilated
hands
and
murmured
faintly
you
come
at
last
then
closing
his
eyes
he
dropped
his
arms
as
if
exhausted
by
the
effort
esther
knelt
beside
him
and
pressed
a
kiss
on
his
pale
face
father
father
said
she
softly
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
a
smile
of
pleasure
broke
over
his
wan
face
and
lighted
up
his
eyes
as
he
feebly
said
god
bless
you
darlings
i
thought
you
never
come
where
mother
and
caddy
here
answered
esther
here
by
me
your
looks
frightened
her
so
that
she
fainted
doctor
burdett
here
interposed
and
said
you
must
all
go
now
he
too
weak
to
bear
more
at
present
let
me
stay
with
him
a
little
longer
pleaded
esther
no
my
child
it
impossible
he
continued
besides
your
mother
will
need
your
attention
and
whilst
he
spoke
he
led
her
into
an
adjoining
room
where
the
others
had
preceded
her
chapter
xxiv
charlie
distinguishes
himself
charlie
had
now
been
many
weeks
under
the
hospitable
roof
of
bird
improving
in
health
and
appearance
indeed
it
would
have
been
a
wonder
if
he
had
not
as
the
kind
mistress
of
the
mansion
seemed
to
do
nought
else
from
day
to
day
but
study
plans
for
his
comfort
and
pleasure
there
was
one
sad
drawback
upon
the
contentment
of
the
dear
old
lady
and
that
was
her
inability
to
procure
charlie
admission
to
the
academy
one
morning
whately
called
upon
her
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
exclaimed
it
all
to
no
purpose
their
laws
are
as
unalterable
as
those
of
the
medes
and
persians
arguments
and
entreaty
are
equally
thrown
away
upon
them
i
been
closeted
at
least
half
a
dozen
times
with
each
director
and
as
all
i
can
say
wo
make
your
a
shade
whiter
i
afraid
his
admission
to
the
academy
must
be
given
up
it
too
bad
rejoined
bird
and
who
may
i
ask
were
the
principal
opposers
they
all
opposed
it
except
mr
weeks
and
mr
bentham
indeed
why
they
are
the
very
ones
that
i
anticipated
would
go
against
it
tooth
and
nail
and
glentworth
surely
he
was
on
our
side
he
why
my
dear
madam
he
was
the
most
rabid
of
the
lot
with
his
sanctified
face
and
canting
tongue
i
almost
ashamed
to
own
it
but
it
the
truth
and
i
should
hesitate
to
tell
it
i
found
the
most
pious
of
the
directors
the
least
accessible
as
to
old
glentworth
he
actually
talked
to
me
as
if
i
was
recommending
the
committal
of
some
horrid
sin
i
afraid
i
shall
be
set
down
by
him
as
a
rabid
abolitionist
i
got
so
warm
on
the
subject
i
cherished
as
strong
prejudices
against
coloured
people
as
any
one
but
i
tell
you
seeing
how
contemptible
it
makes
others
appear
has
gone
a
great
way
towards
eradicating
it
in
me
i
found
myself
obliged
to
use
the
same
arguments
against
it
that
are
used
by
the
abolitionists
and
in
endeavouring
to
convince
others
of
the
absurdity
of
their
prejudices
i
convinced
myself
i
set
my
heart
upon
it
said
bird
in
a
tone
of
regret
but
i
suppose
i
have
to
give
it
up
charlie
do
know
i
made
application
for
his
admission
and
has
been
asking
me
to
let
him
go
a
great
many
of
the
boys
who
attend
there
have
become
acquainted
with
him
and
it
was
only
yesterday
that
glentworth
sons
were
teasing
me
to
consent
to
his
beginning
there
the
next
term
the
boys
concluded
she
have
better
hearts
than
their
parents
oh
i
begin
to
believe
it
all
sham
this
prejudice
i
getting
quite
disgusted
with
myself
for
having
had
it
or
rather
thinking
i
had
it
as
for
saying
it
is
innate
or
that
there
is
any
natural
antipathy
to
that
class
it
all
perfect
folly
children
are
not
born
with
it
or
why
should
they
shrink
from
a
black
nurse
or
playmate
it
all
bosh
concluded
he
indignantly
as
he
brought
his
cane
down
with
a
rap
charlie
been
quite
a
means
of
grace
to
you
laughingly
rejoined
bird
amused
at
his
vehemence
of
manner
well
i
going
to
send
him
to
next
sunday
and
if
there
is
a
rebellion
against
his
admission
there
i
shall
be
quite
in
despair
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
we
are
urged
by
circumstances
to
the
advocacy
of
a
measure
in
which
we
take
but
little
interest
and
of
the
propriety
of
which
we
are
often
very
sceptical
but
so
surely
as
it
is
just
in
itself
in
our
endeavours
to
convert
others
we
convince
ourselves
and
from
lukewarm
apologists
we
become
earnest
advocates
this
was
just
whately
case
he
had
begun
to
canvass
for
the
admission
of
charlie
with
a
doubtful
sense
of
its
propriety
and
in
attempting
to
overcome
the
groundless
prejudices
of
others
he
was
convicted
of
his
own
happily
in
his
case
conviction
was
followed
by
conversion
and
as
he
walked
home
from
bird
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
they
attempted
to
exclude
charlie
from
the
he
would
give
them
a
piece
of
his
mind
and
then
resign
his
superintendency
of
it
on
arriving
at
home
he
found
waiting
for
him
a
young
lady
who
was
formerly
a
member
of
his
class
in
the
i
come
said
she
to
consult
you
about
forming
an
adult
class
in
our
school
for
coloured
persons
we
have
a
girl
living
with
us
who
would
be
very
glad
to
attend
and
she
knows
two
or
three
others
i
willingly
take
the
class
myself
i
consulted
the
pastor
and
several
others
and
no
one
seems
to
anticipate
any
objections
from
the
scholars
if
we
keep
them
on
a
separate
bench
and
do
not
mix
them
up
with
the
white
children
i
delighted
to
hear
you
propose
it
answered
whately
quite
overjoyed
at
the
opening
it
presented
the
plan
meets
my
warmest
approval
i
decidedly
agree
with
you
in
the
propriety
of
our
making
some
effort
for
the
elevation
and
instruction
of
this
hitherto
neglected
class
any
aid
i
can
render
you
astonish
me
interrupted
miss
cass
though
i
must
say
very
agreeably
you
were
the
last
person
from
whom
i
thought
of
obtaining
any
countenance
i
did
not
come
to
you
until
armed
with
the
consent
of
almost
all
the
parties
interested
because
from
you
i
anticipated
considerable
opposition
and
in
her
delight
the
young
girl
grasped
whately
hand
and
shook
it
very
heartily
oh
my
opinions
relative
to
coloured
people
have
lately
undergone
considerable
modification
in
fact
said
he
with
some
little
confusion
quite
a
thorough
revolution
i
do
think
we
have
quite
done
our
duty
by
these
people
well
well
we
must
make
the
future
atone
for
the
past
miss
cass
had
entered
upon
her
project
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
and
being
anxious
that
her
class
in
point
of
numbers
should
make
a
presentable
appearance
had
drafted
into
it
no
less
a
person
than
aunt
comfort
aunt
comfort
was
a
personage
of
great
importance
in
the
little
village
of
warmouth
and
one
whose
services
were
called
into
requisition
on
almost
every
great
domestic
occasion
at
births
she
frequently
officiated
and
few
young
mothers
thought
themselves
entirely
safe
if
the
black
face
of
aunt
comfort
was
not
to
be
seen
at
their
bedside
she
had
a
hand
in
the
compounding
of
almost
every
bridecake
and
had
been
known
to
often
leave
houses
of
feasting
to
prepare
weary
travellers
for
their
final
place
of
rest
every
one
knew
and
all
liked
her
and
no
one
was
more
welcome
at
the
houses
of
the
good
people
of
warmouth
than
aunt
comfort
but
whilst
rendering
her
all
due
praise
for
her
domestic
acquirements
justice
compels
us
to
remark
that
aunt
comfort
was
not
a
literary
character
she
could
get
up
a
shirt
to
perfection
and
made
irreproachable
chowder
but
she
was
not
a
woman
of
letters
in
fact
she
had
arrived
at
maturity
at
a
time
when
negroes
and
books
seldom
came
in
familiar
contact
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
she
cared
very
little
about
the
latter
but
jist
to
miss
cass
she
consented
to
attend
her
class
averring
as
she
did
so
that
she
did
she
was
gwine
to
larn
nothin
when
she
got
thar
miss
cass
however
was
of
the
contrary
opinion
and
anticipated
that
after
a
few
sabbaths
aunt
comfort
would
prove
to
be
quite
a
literary
phenomenon
the
first
time
their
class
assembled
the
white
children
dislocated
their
necks
in
their
endeavours
to
catch
glimpses
of
the
coloured
scholars
who
were
seated
on
a
backless
bench
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
prominent
amongst
them
shone
aunt
comfort
who
in
honour
of
this
extraordinary
occasion
had
retrimmed
her
cap
which
was
resplendent
with
bows
of
red
ribbon
as
large
as
peonies
she
had
a
primer
in
her
hand
and
was
repeating
the
letters
with
the
utmost
regularity
as
miss
cass
pronounced
them
they
got
on
charmingly
until
after
crossing
over
the
letter
o
as
a
matter
of
course
they
came
to
p
and
q
look
here
said
aunt
comfort
with
a
look
of
profound
erudition
anoder
o
what
de
use
of
having
two
of
no
no
aunt
comfort
that
q
the
letter
q
umph
grunted
the
old
woman
incredulously
what
de
use
of
saying
dat
a
q
when
you
jest
said
not
a
minute
ago
was
o
this
is
not
the
same
rejoined
the
teacher
do
you
see
the
little
tail
at
the
bottom
of
it
aunt
comfort
took
off
her
silver
spectacles
and
gave
the
glasses
of
them
a
furious
rub
then
after
essaying
another
look
exclaimed
what
you
mean
dat
little
speck
down
at
the
bottom
of
it
does
yer
yes
aunt
comfort
that
little
speck
as
you
call
it
makes
all
the
difference
it
makes
o
into
q
oh
go
child
said
she
indignantly
you
is
gwine
to
fool
me
dat
ar
way
i
knows
you
of
old
honey
you
up
to
dese
things
you
know
you
allus
was
mighty
and
i
is
gwine
to
dat
dat
ar
little
speck
makes
all
the
difference
no
such
thing
case
it
do
deys
either
both
o
or
both
q
i
clar
o
dat
deys
either
one
or
tother
knowing
by
long
experience
the
utter
futility
of
attempting
to
convince
aunt
comfort
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
by
anything
short
of
a
miracle
the
teacher
wisely
skipped
over
the
obnoxious
letter
then
all
went
smoothly
on
to
the
conclusion
of
the
alphabet
the
lesson
having
terminated
miss
cass
looked
up
and
discovered
standing
near
her
a
coloured
boy
who
she
correctly
surmised
was
sent
as
an
addition
to
her
class
come
here
and
sit
down
said
she
pointing
to
a
seat
next
aunt
comfort
what
is
your
name
charlie
gave
his
name
and
residence
which
were
entered
in
due
form
on
the
teacher
book
now
charles
she
continued
do
you
know
your
letters
yes
was
the
answer
can
you
spell
she
inquired
to
this
also
charlie
gave
an
affirmative
highly
amused
at
the
same
time
at
being
asked
such
a
question
miss
cass
inquired
no
further
into
the
extent
of
his
acquirements
it
never
having
entered
her
head
that
he
could
do
more
than
spell
so
handing
him
one
of
the
primers
she
pointed
out
a
line
on
which
to
begin
the
spirit
of
mischief
entered
our
little
friend
and
he
stumbled
through
bla
bli
blo
blu
with
great
gravity
and
slowness
you
spell
quite
nicely
particularly
for
a
little
coloured
boy
said
miss
cass
encouragingly
as
he
concluded
the
line
take
this
next
she
continued
pointing
to
another
and
when
you
have
learned
it
i
will
hear
you
again
it
was
the
custom
of
the
superintendent
to
question
the
scholars
upon
a
portion
of
bible
history
given
out
the
sabbath
previous
for
study
during
the
week
it
chanced
that
upon
the
day
of
which
we
write
the
subject
for
examination
was
one
with
which
charlie
was
quite
familiar
accordingly
when
the
questions
were
put
to
the
school
he
answered
boldly
and
quickly
to
many
of
them
and
with
an
accuracy
that
astonished
his
fellow
scholars
how
did
you
learn
the
answers
to
those
questions
you
ca
read
said
miss
cass
yes
but
i
can
read
answered
charlie
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
why
did
you
tell
me
so
before
she
asked
because
you
did
ask
me
he
replied
suppressing
a
grin
this
was
true
enough
so
miss
cass
having
nothing
farther
to
say
sat
and
listened
whilst
he
answered
the
numerous
and
sometimes
difficult
questions
addressed
to
the
scholars
not
so
aunt
comfort
she
could
not
restrain
her
admiration
of
this
display
of
talent
on
the
part
of
one
of
her
despised
race
she
was
continually
breaking
out
with
expressions
of
wonder
and
applause
jis
hear
dat
massy
on
us
only
jis
listen
to
de
chile
said
she
talks
jis
de
same
as
if
he
was
white
why
boy
where
you

all
dat
across
the
red
sea
cried
charlie
in
answer
to
a
question
from
the
desk
of
the
superintendent
de
red
sea
umph
chile
you
been
dere
asked
aunt
comfort
with
a
face
full
of
wonder
what
did
you
say
asked
charlie
whose
attention
had
been
arrested
by
the
last
question
why
i
asked
where
you
learned
all
dat
de
children
of
israel
oh
i
learned
that
at
philadelphia
was
his
reply
i
learned
it
at
school
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
you
did
exclaimed
she
raising
her
hands
with
astonishment
is
dere
many
more
of
like
you
charlie
did
not
hear
this
last
question
of
aunt
comfort
therefore
she
was
rather
startled
by
his
replying
in
a
loud
tone
did
i
ever
jis
hear
dat
dere
hostes
of
jest
like
him
only
think
of
it
is
dey
all
dere
yet
honey
they
were
all
drowned
oh
lordy
lordy
rejoined
she
aghast
with
horror
for
charlie
reply
to
a
question
regarding
the
fate
of
pharaoh
army
had
been
by
her
interpreted
as
an
answer
to
her
question
respecting
his
coloured
schoolmates
at
philadelphia
and
how
did
you
honey
continued
she
from
drowning
wid
the
rest
of
why
i
was
there
it
was
thousands
of
years
ago
look
here
what
do
you
mean
she
whispered
did
you
say
jest
now
dat
you
went
to
school
wid
this
was
too
much
for
charlie
who
shook
all
over
with
suppressed
laughter
nor
was
miss
cass
proof
against
the
contagion
she
was
obliged
to
almost
suffocate
herself
with
her
handkerchief
to
avoid
a
serious
explosion
aunt
comfort
you
are
mistaking
him
said
she
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
her
composure
he
is
answering
the
questions
of
the
superintendent
not
yours
and
very
well
he
has
answered
them
too
continued
she
i
like
to
see
little
boys
aspiring
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
intelligent
you
must
persevere
charlie
yes
you
must
honey
chimed
in
aunt
comfort
very
much
like
miss
cass
i
likes
to
see
children
children
of
colour
have
minds
charlie
went
quite
off
at
this
and
it
was
only
by
repeated
hush
hushes
from
miss
cass
and
a
pinch
in
the
back
from
aunt
comfort
that
he
was
restored
to
a
proper
sense
of
his
position
the
questioning
being
now
finished
whately
came
to
charlie
praised
him
highly
for
his
aptness
and
made
some
inquiries
respecting
his
knowledge
of
the
catechism
also
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
join
the
class
that
was
to
be
catechised
in
the
church
during
the
afternoon
to
this
charlie
readily
assented
and
at
the
close
of
the
school
was
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
class
preparatory
to
going
into
the
church
the
public
catechizing
of
the
scholars
was
always
an
event
in
the
village
but
now
a
novelty
was
given
it
by
the
addition
of
a
black
lamb
to
the
flock
and
as
a
matter
of
course
a
much
greater
interest
was
manifested
had
a
lion
entered
the
doors
of
stephen
church
he
might
have
created
greater
consternation
but
he
could
not
have
attracted
more
attention
than
did
our
little
friend
on
passing
beneath
its
sacred
portals
the
length
of
the
aisle
seemed
interminable
to
him
and
on
his
way
to
the
altar
he
felt
oppressed
by
the
scrutiny
of
eyes
through
which
he
was
compelled
to
pass
dural
the
pastor
looked
kindly
at
him
as
he
stood
in
front
of
the
chancel
and
charlie
took
heart
from
his
cheering
smile
now
to
aunt
comfort
who
was
the
only
coloured
person
who
regularly
attended
the
church
a
seat
had
been
assigned
beside
the
organ
which
elevated
position
had
been
given
her
that
the
congregation
might
indulge
in
their
devotions
without
having
their
prejudices
shocked
by
a
too
close
contemplation
of
her
ebony
countenance
but
aunt
comfort
on
this
occasion
determined
to
get
near
enough
to
hear
all
that
passed
and
leaving
her
accustomed
seat
she
planted
herself
in
one
of
the
aisles
of
the
gallery
overlooking
the
altar
where
she
remained
almost
speechless
with
wonder
and
astonishment
at
the
unprecedented
sight
of
a
woolly
head
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
charlie
got
on
very
successfully
until
called
upon
to
repeat
the
prayer
and
strange
to
say
at
this
critical
juncture
his
memory
forsook
him
and
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
of
it
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
think
of
anything
but
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
and
confused
and
annoyed
he
stood
unable
to
proceed
at
this
stage
of
affairs
aunt
comfort
interest
in
charlie
success
had
reached
such
a
pitch
that
her
customary
awe
of
the
place
she
was
in
entirely
departed
and
she
exclaimed
i
give
yer
a
start
farrer
then
overwhelmed
by
the
consciousness
that
she
had
spoken
out
in
meeting
she
sank
down
behind
a
completely
extinguished
at
this
there
was
an
audible
titter
that
was
immediately
suppressed
after
which
charlie
recovered
his
memory
and
started
by
the
opportune
prompting
of
aunt
comfort
he
recited
it
correctly
a
few
questions
more
terminated
the
examination
and
the
children
sat
down
in
front
of
the
altar
until
the
conclusion
of
the
service
bird
highly
delighted
with
the
of
her
bestowed
no
end
of
praises
upon
him
and
even
made
the
coachman
walk
home
that
charlie
might
have
a
seat
in
the
carriage
as
she
alleged
she
was
sure
he
must
be
much
fatigued
and
overcome
with
the
excitement
of
the
day
then
taking
the
reins
into
her
own
hands
she
drove
them
safely
home
chapter
xxv
the
heir
we
must
now
return
to
philadelphia
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
office
of
balch
we
shall
find
that
gentleman
in
company
with
walters
both
look
anxious
and
are
poring
over
a
letter
which
is
outspread
before
them
it
was
like
a
to
me
said
balch
the
idea
of
there
being
another
heir
never
entered
my
brain
i
did
even
know
he
had
a
living
relative
when
did
you
get
the
letter
asked
walters
only
this
morning
and
i
sent
for
you
immediately
let
us
read
it
again
we
make
another
attempt
to
decipher
this
incomprehensible
name
confound
the
fellow
why
could
he
write
so
that
some
one
besides
himself
could
read
it
we
must
stumble
through
it
said
he
as
he
again
began
the
letter
as
follows
dear
sir
immediately
on
receipt
of
your
favour
i
called
upon
thurston
to
take
the
necessary
steps
for
securing
the
property
of
your
late
client
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
that
another
claimant
had
started
up
and
already
taken
the
preliminary
measures
to
entering
upon
possession
this
gentleman
now
what
would
you
call
that
name
walters
to
me
it
looks
like
stimmens
or
stunners
or
something
of
the
kind
never
mind
the
name
exclaimed
walters
skip
that
let
me
hear
the
rest
of
the
letter
we
shall
find
out
who
he
is
soon
enough
in
all
conscience
well
then
resumed
balch
this
gentleman
is
a
resident
in
your
city
and
he
will
no
doubt
take
an
early
opportunity
of
calling
on
you
in
reference
to
the
matter
it
is
my
opinion
that
without
a
will
in
their
favour
these
children
can
not
oppose
his
claim
successfully
if
he
can
prove
his
consanguinity
to
garie
his
lawyer
here
showed
me
a
copy
of
the
letters
and
papers
which
are
to
be
used
as
evidence
and
i
must
say
they
without
flaw
he
proves
himself
undoubtedly
to
be
the
first
cousin
of
garie
you
are
no
doubt
aware
that
these
children
being
the
offspring
of
a
can
not
inherit
in
this
state
except
under
certain
circumstances
the
property
of
a
white
father
i
am
therefore
very
much
afraid
that
they
are
entirely
at
his
mercy
well
then
said
walters
when
balch
finished
reading
the
letter
it
is
clear
there
is
an
heir
and
his
claim
be
well
sustained
if
such
a
man
as
beckley
the
first
lawyer
in
the
state
does
not
hesitate
to
endorse
it
and
as
all
the
property
with
the
exception
of
a
few
thousands
in
my
hands
lies
in
georgia
i
afraid
the
poor
children
will
come
off
badly
unless
this
new
heir
prove
to
be
a
man
of
generosity
at
all
events
it
seems
we
are
completely
at
his
mercy
we
must
hope
for
the
best
rejoined
balch
if
he
has
any
heart
he
certainly
will
make
some
provision
for
them
the
disappearance
of
that
will
is
to
me
most
unaccountable
i
am
confident
it
was
at
his
house
it
seemed
so
singular
that
none
of
his
papers
should
be
missing
except
that
there
were
a
great
many
others
deeds
mortgages
scattered
over
the
floor
but
no
will
the
gentlemen
were
thus
conversing
when
they
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
come
in
cried
balch
and
in
answer
to
the
request
in
walked
george
stevens
walters
and
balch
bowed
very
stiffly
and
the
latter
inquired
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
a
visit
i
have
called
upon
you
in
reference
to
the
property
of
the
late
mr
garie
oh
you
are
acting
in
behalf
of
this
new
claimant
i
suppose
rejoined
balch
sir
said
stevens
looking
as
though
he
did
not
thoroughly
understand
him
i
said
repeated
balch
that
i
presumed
you
called
in
behalf
of
this
heir
to
garie
property
stevens
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
drawing
himself
up
exclaimed
i
am
the
heir
you
the
heir
cried
both
the
gentlemen
almost
simultaneously
yes
i
am
the
heir
coolly
repeated
stevens
with
an
assured
look
i
am
the
first
cousin
of
mr
garie
you
his
first
cousin
it
is
impossible
said
walters
you
discover
it
is
not
only
possible
but
true
i
am
as
i
said
garie
first
cousin
if
you
are
that
you
are
more
said
walters
fiercely
you
his
murderer
at
this
charge
stevens
turned
deathly
pale
yes
continued
walters
you
either
murdered
him
or
instigated
others
to
do
so
it
was
you
who
directed
the
rioters
against
both
him
and
me
i
have
proof
of
what
i
say
and
can
produce
it
now
your
motive
is
clear
as
day
you
wanted
his
money
and
destroyed
him
to
obtain
it
his
blood
is
on
your
hands
hissed
walters
through
his
clenched
teeth
in
the
excitement
consequent
upon
such
a
charge
stevens
unnoticed
by
himself
had
overturned
a
bottle
of
red
ink
and
its
contents
had
slightly
stained
his
hands
when
walters
charged
him
with
having
garie
blood
upon
them
he
involuntarily
looked
down
and
saw
his
hands
stained
with
red
an
expression
of
intense
horror
flitted
over
his
face
when
he
observed
it
but
quickly
regaining
his
composure
he
replied
it
only
a
little
ink
yes
i
know
is
ink
rejoined
walters
scornfully
look
at
him
balch
he
continued
he
does
dare
to
look
either
of
us
in
the
face
it
false
exclaimed
stevens
with
an
effort
to
appear
courageous
it
as
false
as
hell
and
any
man
that
charges
me
with
it
is
a
liar
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
his
lips
when
walters
sprang
upon
him
with
the
ferocity
of
a
tiger
and
seizing
him
by
the
throat
shook
and
whirled
him
about
as
though
he
were
a
plaything
stop
stop
walters
cried
balch
endeavouring
to
loose
his
hold
upon
the
throat
of
stevens
who
was
already
purple
in
the
face
let
him
go
this
violence
can
benefit
neither
party
loose
your
hold
at
this
remonstrance
walters
dashed
stevens
from
him
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
exclaiming
now
go
and
prosecute
me
if
you
dare
and
i
tell
for
what
i
chastised
you
prosecute
me
for
an
assault
if
you
think
you
can
risk
the
consequences
balch
assisted
him
from
the
floor
and
placed
him
in
a
chair
where
he
sat
holding
his
side
and
panting
for
breath
when
he
was
able
to
speak
he
exclaimed
with
a
look
of
concentrated
malignity
remember
we
be
even
some
day
i
never
received
a
blow
and
forgot
it
afterwards
bear
that
in
mind
this
will
never
do
gentlemen
said
balch
soothingly
this
conduct
is
unworthy
of
you
you
are
unreasonable
both
of
you
when
you
have
cooled
down
we
will
discuss
the
matter
as
we
should
you
discuss
it
alone
then
said
stevens
rising
and
walking
to
the
door
and
when
you
have
any
further
communication
to
make
you
must
come
to
me
stop
stop
do
go
cried
balch
following
him
out
at
the
door
which
they
closed
behind
them
do
go
away
in
a
passion
stevens
you
and
walters
are
both
too
hasty
come
in
here
and
sit
down
said
he
opening
the
door
of
a
small
adjoining
room
wait
here
one
moment
come
back
to
you
this
will
never
do
walters
said
he
as
he
his
office
the
fellow
has
the
upper
hand
of
us
and
we
must
humour
him
we
should
suppress
our
own
feelings
for
the
children
sake
you
are
as
well
aware
as
i
am
of
the
necessity
of
some
compromise
we
are
in
his
power
for
the
present
and
must
act
as
circumstances
compel
us
to
i
ca
discuss
the
matter
with
him
interrupted
walters
he
an
unmitigated
scoundrel
i
could
command
my
temper
in
his
presence
for
five
minutes
if
you
can
arrange
anything
with
him
at
all
advantageous
to
the
children
i
shall
be
satisfied
it
will
be
more
than
i
expect
only
bear
in
mind
that
what
i
have
in
my
hands
belonging
to
garie
we
must
retain
he
knows
nothing
of
that
very
well
rejoined
balch
depend
upon
it
i
do
my
best
and
closing
the
door
he
went
back
to
stevens
now
stevens
said
he
drawing
up
a
chair
we
will
talk
over
this
matter
dispassionately
and
try
and
arrive
at
some
amicable
arrangement
be
kind
enough
to
inform
me
what
your
claims
are
balch
are
a
gentleman
began
stevens
and
therefore
willing
to
discuss
the
matter
thoroughly
with
you
you
find
me
disposed
to
do
a
great
deal
for
these
children
but
i
wish
it
distinctly
understood
at
the
beginning
that
whatever
i
may
give
them
i
bestow
as
a
favour
i
concede
nothing
to
them
as
a
right
legally
they
have
not
the
slightest
claim
upon
me
of
that
you
who
are
an
excellent
lawyer
must
be
well
aware
we
wo
discuss
that
point
at
present
stevens
i
believe
you
intimated
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
say
upon
what
evidence
you
purposed
sustaining
your
claims
well
to
come
to
the
point
then
said
stevens
the
deceased
garie
was
as
i
before
said
my
first
cousin
his
father
and
my
mother
were
brother
and
sister
my
mother
married
in
opposition
to
her
desires
they
cut
her
off
from
the
family
and
for
years
there
was
no
communication
between
them
at
my
father
death
my
mother
made
overtures
for
a
reconciliation
which
were
contemptuously
rejected
at
length
she
died
i
was
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
who
my
grandparents
were
and
only
a
few
months
since
on
the
death
of
my
father
sister
did
i
make
the
discovery
here
said
he
extending
the
packet
of
letters
which
the
reader
will
remember
once
agitated
him
so
strangely
here
are
the
letters
that
passed
between
my
mother
and
her
father
balch
took
up
one
and
read
madam
permit
me
to
return
this
letter
wherein
you
declare
yourself
the
loving
and
repentant
daughter
of
bernard
garie
and
at
the
same
time
inform
you
that
by
your
own
acts
you
have
deprived
yourself
of
all
claim
to
that
relation
in
opposition
to
my
wishes
and
in
open
defiance
of
my
express
commands
you
chose
to
unite
your
fortune
with
one
in
every
respect
your
inferior
if
that
union
has
not
resulted
as
happily
as
you
expected
you
must
sustain
yourself
by
the
reflection
that
you
are
the
author
of
your
own
misfortunes
and
alone
to
blame
for
your
present
miserable
respectfully
yours
bernard
garie
balch
read
one
after
another
letters
of
a
similar
purport
in
fact
a
long
correspondence
between
bernard
garie
and
the
mother
of
stevens
when
he
had
finished
the
latter
remarked
in
addition
to
those
i
can
produce
my
mother
certificate
of
baptism
her
marriage
certificate
and
every
necessary
proof
of
my
being
her
son
if
that
does
not
suffice
to
make
a
strong
case
i
am
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
will
balch
pondered
a
few
moments
and
then
inquired
looking
steadily
at
stevens
how
long
have
you
known
of
this
relationship
oh
i
known
it
these
three
years
three
years
why
my
dear
sir
only
a
few
moments
ago
you
said
a
few
months
oh
did
i
said
stevens
very
much
confused
i
meant
or
should
have
said
three
years
then
of
course
you
were
aware
that
garie
was
your
cousin
when
he
took
the
house
beside
you
oh
yes
that
is
yes
yes
i
aware
of
it
and
did
you
make
any
overtures
of
a
social
character
asked
balch
well
yes
that
is
to
say
my
wife
did
were
you
the
night
of
the
murder
stevens
turned
pale
at
this
question
and
replied
hesitatingly
why
at
home
of
course
you
were
at
home
and
saw
the
house
of
your
cousins
assaulted
and
made
no
effort
to
succour
them
or
their
children
the
next
morning
you
are
one
of
the
coroner
inquest
and
hurry
through
the
proceedings
never
once
saying
a
word
of
your
relationship
to
them
nor
yet
making
any
inquiry
respecting
the
fate
of
the
children
is
very
i
do
see
what
this
is
to
amount
to
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
claim
as
heir
we
are
coming
to
that
rejoined
balch
this
as
i
said
is
very
singular
and
when
i
couple
it
with
some
other
circumstances
that
have
come
to
my
knowledge
it
is
more
than
singular
is
here
are
a
number
of
houses
assaulted
by
a
mob
two
or
three
days
before
the
assault
takes
place
a
list
in
your
handwriting
and
which
is
headed
to
be
is
found
under
circumstances
that
leave
no
doubt
that
it
came
directly
from
you
well
the
same
mob
that
attacks
these
places
out
by
traverse
a
long
distance
to
reach
the
house
of
your
neighbour
they
break
into
it
and
kill
him
and
you
who
are
aware
at
the
time
that
he
is
your
own
cousin
do
not
attempt
to
interpose
to
prevent
it
although
it
can
be
proved
that
you
were
with
the
marauders
no
you
allow
him
to
be
destroyed
without
an
effort
to
save
him
and
immediately
claim
his
property
now
stevens
people
disposed
to
be
suspicions
seeing
how
much
you
were
to
be
the
gainer
by
his
removal
and
knowing
you
had
some
connection
with
this
mob
might
not
scruple
to
say
that
instigated
the
attack
by
which
he
lost
his
life
and
i
put
it
to
you
now
do
you
think
that
if
it
was
any
one
else
you
would
say
that
the
thing
looked
suspicious
stevens
winced
at
this
but
made
no
effort
to
reply
balch
continued
what
i
was
going
to
remark
is
simply
this
as
we
are
in
possession
of
these
facts
and
able
to
prove
them
by
competent
witnesses
we
should
not
be
willing
to
remain
perfectly
silent
respecting
it
unless
you
made
what
regarded
as
a
suitable
provision
for
the
children
i
willing
as
i
said
before
to
do
something
but
do
flatter
yourself
i
do
any
more
than
i
originally
intended
from
any
fear
of
disclosures
from
you
i
not
to
be
frightened
said
stevens
i
not
at
all
disposed
to
attempt
to
frighten
you
however
you
know
how
far
a
mere
statement
of
these
facts
would
go
towards
rendering
your
position
in
society
more
agreeable
a
person
who
has
been
arrested
on
suspicion
of
murder
is
apt
to
be
shunned
and
distrusted
it
ca
be
helped
people
are
so
very
squeamish
they
draw
back
you
know
under
such
circumstances
i
do
see
how
such
a
suspicion
can
attach
itself
to
me
rejoined
stevens
sharply
oh
well
we
wo
discuss
that
any
further
let
me
hear
what
you
will
do
for
the
children
balch
saw
from
the
nervous
and
embarrassed
manner
of
stevens
that
the
indirect
threat
of
exposing
him
had
had
considerable
effect
and
his
downcast
looks
and
agitation
rather
strengthened
in
his
mind
the
suspicions
that
had
been
excited
by
the
disclosures
of
walters
after
a
few
moments
silence
stevens
said
i
settle
three
thousand
dollars
on
each
of
the
children
now
i
think
that
is
treating
them
liberally
liberally
exclaimed
balch
in
a
tone
of
contempt
liberally
you
acquire
by
the
death
of
their
father
property
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
you
offer
these
children
who
are
the
rightful
heirs
three
thousand
dollars
that
sir
wo
suffice
i
think
it
should
then
rejoined
stevens
by
the
laws
of
georgia
these
children
instead
of
being
his
heirs
are
my
slaves
their
mother
was
a
slave
before
them
and
they
were
born
slaves
and
if
they
were
in
savannah
i
could
sell
them
both
on
the
whole
i
think
i
made
you
a
very
fair
offer
and
advise
you
to
think
of
it
no
stevens
i
shall
accept
no
such
paltry
sum
if
you
wish
a
quick
and
peaceful
possession
of
what
you
are
pleased
to
regard
as
your
rights
you
must
tender
something
more
advantageous
or
i
shall
feel
compelled
to
bring
this
thing
into
court
even
at
the
risk
of
loss
and
there
you
know
we
should
be
obliged
to
make
a
clear
statement
of
connected
with
this
business
it
might
be
advantageous
to
to
bring
the
thing
fully
before
the
court
and
public
but
i
exceedingly
doubtful
whether
it
would
advance
interest
stevens
winced
at
this
and
asked
what
would
you
consider
a
fair
offer
i
should
consider
a
just
offer
half
a
fair
one
and
a
quarter
as
little
as
you
could
have
the
conscience
to
expect
us
to
take
i
do
see
any
use
in
this
chaffering
balch
said
stephens
you
ca
expect
me
to
give
you
any
such
sums
as
you
propose
name
a
sum
that
you
can
reasonably
expect
to
get
well
said
balch
rising
you
must
give
us
fifteen
thousand
dollars
and
you
should
think
yourself
well
off
then
we
could
commence
a
suit
and
put
you
to
nearly
that
expense
to
defend
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
notoriety
that
the
circumstance
would
occasion
you
both
walters
and
i
are
willing
to
spend
both
money
and
time
in
defence
of
these
children
rights
i
assure
you
they
are
not
friendless
i
give
twelve
thousand
and
not
a
cent
more
if
i
hung
for
it
said
stevens
almost
involuntarily
who
spoke
of
hanging
asked
balch
oh
rejoined
stevens
that
is
only
my
emphatic
way
of
speaking
of
course
you
meant
figuratively
said
balch
in
a
tone
of
irony
mentally
adding
as
i
hope
you
may
be
one
day
literally
stevens
looked
flushed
and
angry
but
balch
continued
without
appearing
to
notice
him
and
said
i
speak
to
walters
should
he
acquiesce
in
your
proposal
i
am
willing
to
accept
it
however
i
can
not
definitely
decide
without
consulting
him
i
will
inform
you
of
the
result
chapter
xxvi
home
again
to
charlie
the
summer
had
been
an
exceedingly
short
one
time
had
flown
so
pleasantly
away
everything
that
could
be
done
to
make
the
place
agreeable
bird
had
effected
amongst
the
number
of
her
acquaintances
who
had
conceived
a
regard
for
her
young
was
a
promising
artist
to
whom
she
had
been
a
friend
and
patroness
charlie
paid
him
frequent
visits
and
would
sit
hour
after
hour
in
his
studio
watching
the
progress
of
his
work
having
nothing
else
at
the
time
to
amuse
him
he
one
day
asked
the
permission
to
try
his
hand
at
a
sketch
being
supplied
with
the
necessary
materials
he
commenced
a
copy
of
a
small
drawing
and
was
working
assiduously
when
the
artist
came
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
did
you
ever
draw
before
he
asked
with
a
start
of
surprise
never
replied
charlie
except
on
my
slate
at
school
i
sometimes
used
to
sketch
the
boys
faces
and
you
have
never
received
any
instructions
never
not
even
a
hint
was
the
answer
and
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
attempted
a
sketch
upon
paper
yes
the
very
first
then
you
are
a
little
prodigy
said
the
artist
slapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
i
must
take
you
in
hand
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
come
here
regularly
every
day
and
i
teach
you
will
you
come
certainly
if
you
wish
it
but
now
tell
me
do
you
really
think
that
drawing
good
well
charlie
if
i
had
done
it
it
would
be
pronounced
very
bad
for
me
but
coming
from
your
hands
it
something
astonishing
really
now
you
not
joking
me
no
charlie
i
in
earnest
i
assure
you
i
am
it
is
drawn
with
great
spirit
and
the
boy
that
you
have
put
in
by
the
pump
is
exceedingly
well
done
this
praise
served
as
a
great
incentive
to
our
little
friend
who
day
after
day
thenceforth
was
found
at
the
studio
busily
engaged
with
his
crayons
and
making
rapid
progress
in
his
new
art
he
had
been
thus
occupied
some
weeks
and
one
morning
was
hurrying
to
the
to
get
through
his
meal
that
he
might
be
early
at
the
studio
when
he
found
bird
in
her
accustomed
seat
looking
very
sad
why
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
on
observing
the
unusually
grave
face
of
his
friend
oh
charlie
my
dear
i
received
very
distressing
intelligence
from
philadelphia
your
father
is
quite
my
father
ill
cried
he
with
a
look
of
alarm
yes
my
dear
quite
sick
so
says
my
letter
here
are
two
for
you
charlie
hastily
broke
the
seal
of
one
and
read
as
follows
my
dear
little
brother
we
are
all
in
deep
distress
in
consequence
of
the
misfortunes
brought
upon
us
by
the
mob
our
home
has
been
destroyed
and
worse
than
all
our
poor
father
was
caught
and
so
severely
beaten
by
the
rioters
that
for
some
days
his
life
was
entirely
despaired
of
thank
god
he
is
now
improving
and
we
have
every
reasonable
hope
of
his
ultimate
recovery
mother
caddy
and
i
as
you
may
well
suppose
are
almost
prostrated
by
this
accumulation
of
misfortunes
and
but
for
the
kindness
of
walters
with
whom
we
are
living
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
become
of
us
dear
and
garie
here
followed
a
passage
that
was
so
scored
and
crossed
as
to
be
illegible
after
a
short
endeavour
to
decipher
it
he
continued
we
would
like
to
see
you
very
much
and
mother
grows
every
day
more
anxious
for
your
return
i
forgot
to
add
in
connection
with
the
mob
that
walters
house
was
also
attacked
but
unsuccessfully
the
rioters
having
met
a
signal
repulse
mother
and
caddy
send
a
world
of
love
to
you
so
does
kinch
who
comes
every
day
to
see
us
and
is
often
extremely
useful

our
united
kind
regards

thank
her
in
our
behalf
for
her
great
kindness
to
ever
yours
esther
do
try
and
manage
to
come
home
soon
the
tears
trickled
down
charlie
cheek
as
he
perused
the
letter
which
when
he
had
finished
reading
he
handed
to
bird
and
then
commenced
the
other
this
proved
to
be
from
kinch
who
had
spent
all
the
spare
time
at
his
disposal
since
the
occurrence
of
the
mob
in
preparing
it
to
charles
ellis

yours
de
younge
esq
charlie
could
not
but
smile
through
his
tears
as
he
read
this
curious
epistle
which
was
not
more
remarkable
for
its
graceful
composition
than
its
wonderful
chirography
some
of
the
lines
were
written
in
blue
ink
some
in
red
and
others
in
that
pale
muddy
black
which
is
the
peculiar
colour
of
ink
after
passing
through
the
various
experiments
of
who
generally
entertain
the
belief
that
all
foreign
substances
from
to
necessarily
improve
the
colour
and
quality
of
that
important
liquid
why
every
other
word
almost
is
commenced
with
a
capital
and
i
declare
he
even
made
some
in

cried
charlie
running
his
finger
mirthfully
along
the
lines
until
he
came
to
your
father
is
very
bad
here
the
tears
came
welling
up
again
the
shower
had
returned
almost
before
the
sun
had
departed
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
he
leant
sobbing
on
the
table
cheer
up
charlie
cheer
up

little
man
all
may

bird
he
sobbed

very
kind
to

go
home
i
must
see
mother
and
father

course

if
you
wish
yet
i
should
like
you
to
remain
with
me
if
you
will
no
no
bird
i
must
stay
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
remain
here
idle
and
enjoying
myself
and
they
so
poor
and
unhappy
at
home
i
could
stay
said
he
rising
from
the
table
i
must
go
well
my
dear
you
ca
go
now
sit
down
and
finish
your
breakfast
or
you
will
have
a
i
not
hungry
i
ca
eat
he
replied
my
appetite
has
all
gone
and
stealing
away
from
the
room
he
went
up
into
his
chamber
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
wept
bitterly
bird
was
greatly
distressed
at
the
idea
of
losing
her
little
favourite
he
had
been
so
much
with
her
that
she
had
become
strongly
attached
to
him
and
therefore
looked
forward
to
his
departure
with
unfeigned
regret
but
charlie
could
not
be
persuaded
to
stay
and
reluctantly
bird
made
arrangements
for
his
journey
home
even
the
servants
looked
a
little
sorry
when
they
heard
of
his
intended
departure
and
reuben
the
coachman
actually
presented
him
with
a
as
a
token
of
his
regard
bird
accompanied
him
to
the
steamer
and
placed
him
under
the
special
care
of
the
captain
so
that
he
was
most
comfortably
provided
for
until
his
arrival
in
new
york
where
he
took
the
cars
direct
for
home
not
having
written
to
inform
them
on
what
day
he
might
be
expected
he
anticipated
giving
them
a
joyful
surprise
and
with
this
end
in
view
hastened
in
the
direction
of
walters
as
he
passed
along
his
eye
was
attracted
by
a
figure
before
him
which
he
thought
he
recognized
and
on
closer
inspection
it
proved
to
be
his
sister
caddy
full
of
boyish
fun
he
crept
up
behind
her
and
clasped
his
hands
over
her
eyes
exclaiming
in
an
assumed
voice
now
who
am
i
go
away
you
impudent
nasty
thing
cried
caddy
plunging
violently
charlie
loosed
his
hold
she
turned
and
beheld
her
brother
oh
charlie
charlie
is
it
you
why
bless
you
you
naughty
fellow
how
you
frightened
me
said
she
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissing
him
again
and
again
when
did
you
come
oh
how
delighted
mother
and
ess
will
be
i
only
arrived
about
half
an
hour
ago
how
are
mother
and
father
and
esther
mother
and
ess
are
well
and
father
better
but
i
so
glad
to
see
you
she
cried
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
and
additional
embraces
why
cad
said
he
endeavouring
to
suppress
some
watery
sensations
of
his
own
i
afraid
you
not
a
bit
pleased
at
my
return
you
actually
crying
about
it
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
that
i
ca
help
it
she
replied
as
she
fell
to
crying
and
kissing
him
more
furiously
than
before
charlie
became
much
confused
at
these
repeated
demonstrations
of
joyful
affection
in
the
crowded
street
and
gently
disengaging
her
remarked
see
caddy
everybody
is
looking
at
us
let
us
walk
on
i
had
almost
forgot
i
was
sent
on
an
errand
however
it
not
of
much
consequence
i
go
home
again
with
you
and
taking
his
hand
they
trudged
on
together
how
did
you
say
father
was
he
asked
again
oh
he
better
bodily
that
is
he
has
some
appetite
sits
up
every
day
and
is
gradually
getting
stronger
but
he
all
wrong
here
said
she
tapping
her
forehead
sometimes
he
do
know
any
of
us
and
it
makes
us
all
feel
so
bad
here
the
tears
came
trickling
down
again
as
she
continued
oh
charlie
what
those
white
devils
will
have
to
answer
for
when
i
think
of
how
much
injury
they
have
done
us
i
them
i
know
it
wrong
to
hate
anybody
but
i
ca
help
it
and
i
believe
god
hates
them
as
much
as
i
do
charlie
looked
gloomy
and
as
he
made
no
rejoinder
she
continued
we
did
save
a
thing
not
even
a
change
of
clothes
they
broke
and
burnt
up
everything
and
then
the
way
they
beat
poor
father
was
horrible
horrible
just
think
they
chopped
his
fingers
nearly
all
off
so
that
he
has
only
the
stumps
left
charlie
charlie
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
to
see
him
he
ca
even
feed
himself
and
he
never
be
able
to
work
again
do
grieve
cad
said
charlie
with
an
effort
to
suppress
his
own
tears
i
almost
a
man
now
continued
he
drawing
himself
up
do
be
afraid
i
take
care
of
you
all
thus
conversing
they
reached
walters
caddy
wanted
charlie
to
stop
and
look
at
the
damage
effected
by
the
mob
upon
the
outside
of
the
house
but
he
was
anxious
to
go
in
and
ran
up
the
steps
and
gave
the
bell
a
very
sharp
pull
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
was
about
to
make
some
exclamation
of
surprise
and
was
only
restrained
by
a
warning
look
from
charlie
hurrying
past
them
caddy
led
the
way
to
the
room
where
her
mother
and
esther
were
sitting
with
a
cry
of
joy
ellis
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
before
he
was
aware
of
their
presence
he
found
himself
half
smothered
by
her
and
esther
they
had
never
been
separated
before
his
trip
to
warmouth
and
their
reunion
under
such
circumstances
was
particularly
affecting
none
of
them
could
speak
for
a
few
moments
and
charlie
clung
round
his
mother
neck
as
though
he
would
never
loose
his
hold
mother
mother
was
all
he
could
utter
yet
in
that
word
was
comprised
a
world
of
joy
and
affection
esther
soon
came
in
for
her
share
of
caresses
then
charlie
inquired
where
father
in
here
said
ellis
leading
the
way
to
an
adjoining
room
i
think
he
will
know
you
perhaps
he
may
in
one
corner
of
the
apartment
propped
up
in
a
large
easy
chair
by
a
number
of
pillows
sat
poor
ellis
gazing
vacantly
about
the
room
and
muttering
to
himself
his
hair
had
grown
quite
white
and
his
form
was
emaciated
in
the
extreme
there
was
a
broad
scar
across
his
forehead
and
his
dull
lustreless
eyes
were
deeply
sunken
in
his
head
he
took
no
notice
of
them
as
they
approached
but
continued
muttering
and
looking
at
his
hands
charlie
was
almost
petrified
at
the
change
wrought
in
his
father
a
few
months
before
he
had
left
him
in
the
prime
of
healthful
manhood
now
he
was
bent
and
spectrelike
and
old
in
appearance
as
if
the
frosts
of
eighty
winters
had
suddenly
fallen
on
him
ellis
laid
her
hand
gently
upon
his
shoulder
and
said
husband
here
charlie
he
made
no
reply
but
continued
muttering
and
examining
his
mutilated
hands
it
charlie
she
repeated
oh
ay
nice
little
boy
he
replied
vacantly
whose
son
is
he
ellis
voice
quivered
as
she
reiterated
it
charlie
our
charlie
do
you
know
him
oh
yes
nice
little
boy
nice
little
boy
oh
he
continued
in
a
suppressed
and
hurried
tone
as
a
look
of
alarm
crossed
his
face
run
home
quick
little
boy
and
tell
your
mother
they
coming
thousands
of
them
they
guns
and
swords
and
clubs
hush
there
they
come
there
they
come
and
he
buried
his
face
in
the
shawl
and
trembled
in
an
agony
of
fright
oh
mother
this
is
dreadful
exclaimed
charlie
do
he
know
any
of
you
yes
sometimes
his
mind
comes
back
very
seldom
though
only
for
a
very
little
while
come
away
talking
to
him
sometimes
makes
him
worse
and
slowly
and
sorrowfully
the
two
left
the
apartment
that
evening
after
ellis
had
been
safely
bestowed
in
bed
the
family
gathered
round
the
fire
in
the
room
of
ellis
where
charlie
entertained
them
with
a
description
of
warmouth
and
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
passed
the
time
whilst
there
he
was
enthusiastic
respecting
bird
and
her
kindness
mother
she
is
such
a
old
lady
if
i
been
as
white
as
snow
and
her
own
son
she
could
have
been
kinder
to
me
she
did
want
me
to
come
away
and
cried
ever
so
much
let
me
show
you
what
she
gave
me
charlie
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
small
wallet
from
which
he
counted
out
four
bills
two
fives
and
a
two
dollar
and
a
half
gold
piece
ai
i
rich
said
he
as
with
the
air
of
a
millionaire
he
tossed
the
money
upon
a
table
now
he
continued
do
you
know
what
i
about
to
do
not
receiving
any
answer
from
his
wondering
sisters
or
mother
he
added
why
just
this
here
mother
this
is
yours
said
he
placing
the
four
bills
before
her
and
here
are
five
apiece
for
esther
and
cad
the
balance
is
for
your
humble
servant
now
then
he
concluded
what
do
you
think
of
that
ellis
looked
fondly
at
him
and
stroking
his
head
told
him
that
he
was
a
good
son
and
esther
and
caddy
declared
him
to
be
the
best
brother
in
town
now
girls
said
he
with
the
air
of
a
patriarch
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
your
money
mine
will
go
towards
buying
me
a
dress
and
esther
will
save
hers
for
a
particular
purpose
said
caddy
i
tell
you
something
about
her
and
walters
continued
she
with
a
mischievous
look
at
her
sister
oh
caddy
do
ai
you
ashamed
to
plague
me
so
asked
esther
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
mother
pray
stop
her
cried
she
pleadingly
hush
caddy
interposed
her
mother
authoritatively
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
well
resumed
caddy
mother
says
i
must
tell
but
i
can
say
this
much
esther
here
put
her
hand
over
her
sister
mouth
and
effectually
prevented
any
communication
she
was
disposed
to
make
never
mind
her
ess
cried
charlie
you
tell
me
all
in
good
time
especially
if
it
anything
worth
knowing
esther
made
no
reply
but
releasing
her
sister
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
went
upstairs
to
charlie
chamber
where
he
found
her
on
retiring
for
the
night
i
glad
you
here
ess
said
he
you
indulge
me
here
is
the
key
open
my
trunk
and
get
me
out
a
nightcap
i
too
tired
or
too
lazy
to
get
it
for
myself
esther
stooped
down
opened
the
trunk
and
commenced
searching
for
the
article
of
in
question
come
ess
said
charles
coaxingly
tell
me
what
this
is
about
you
and
mr
walters
she
made
no
reply
at
first
but
fumbled
about
in
the
bottom
of
the
trunk
professedly
in
search
of
the
nightcap
which
she
at
that
moment
held
in
her
hand
ca
you
tell
me
he
again
asked
oh
there
nothing
to
tell
charlie
she
answered
there
must
be
something
ess
or
you
would
have
blushed
up
so
when
cad
was
about
to
speak
of
it
do
said
he
approaching
her
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
neck
do
tell
me
all
about
it
i
am
sure
there
is
some
secret
oh
no
charlie
there
is
no
secret
it
only
this
here
she
stopped
and
blushing
turned
her
head
away
ess
this
is
nonsense
said
charlie
impatiently
if
it
anything
worth
knowing
why
ca
you
tell
a
fellow
come
said
he
kissing
her
tell
me
now
like
a
dear
old
ess
as
you
are
well
charlie
said
she
jerking
the
words
out
with
an
effort
walters
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
phew
gemini
that
is
news
exclaimed
charlie
and
are
you
going
to
accept
him
ess
i
do
know
she
answered
do
know
repeated
charlie
in
a
tone
of
surprise
why
ess
astonished
at
you
such
a
capital
fellow
as
he
is
half
the
girls
of
our
acquaintance
would
give
an
eye
for
the
chance
but
he
is
so
rich
responded
esther
well
now
that
a
great
objection
ai
it
i
should
say
all
the
better
on
that
account
rejoined
charlie
the
money
is
the
great
continued
she
everybody
would
say
i
married
him
for
that
then
would
lie
everybody
very
often
does
if
i
was
you
ess
and
loved
him
i
should
let
his
fortune
stand
in
the
way
i
wish
continued
he
pulling
up
his
that
some
amiable
young
girl
with
a
fortune
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
would
make
me
an
offer
like
to
catch
myself
refusing
her
the
idea
of
a
youth
of
his
tender
years
marrying
any
one
seemed
so
ludicrous
to
esther
that
she
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
to
the
great
chagrin
of
our
hero
who
seemed
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
his
sister
had
not
a
proper
appreciation
of
his
years
and
inches
do
laugh
ess
but
tell
me
do
you
really
intend
to
refuse
him
i
ca
decide
yet
charlie
answered
she
seriously
if
we
were
situated
as
we
were
before
were
not
such
absolute
paupers
i
would
hesitate
to
accept
him
but
to
bring
a
family
of
comparative
beggars
upon
him
i
make
up
my
mind
to
do
that
charlie
looked
grave
as
esther
made
this
last
objection
boy
as
he
was
he
felt
its
weight
and
justice
well
ess
rejoined
he
i
do
know
what
to
say
about
it
of
course
i
ca
advise
what
does
mother
say
she
leaves
it
entirely
to
me
she
answered
she
says
i
must
act
just
as
i
feel
is
right
i
certainly
would
have
him
at
all
ess
if
i
did
love
him
and
if
i
did
i
should
let
the
money
stand
in
the
way
so
good
night
charlie
slept
very
late
the
next
morning
and
was
scarcely
dressed
when
esther
knocked
at
his
door
with
the
cheerful
tidings
that
her
father
had
a
lucid
interval
and
was
waiting
to
see
him
dressing
himself
hastily
he
followed
her
into
their
father
room
when
he
entered
the
feeble
sufferer
stretched
out
his
mutilated
arms
towards
him
and
clasped
him
round
the
neck
they
tell
me
said
he
that
you
came
yesterday
and
that
i
did
recognize
you
i
thought
when
i
awoke
this
morning
that
i
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
some
dear
face
but
my
head
aches
so
that
i
often
forget
yes
often
forget
my
boy
he
continued
you
are
all
your
mother
and
sisters
have
to
depend
upon
now
i
i
here
his
voice
faltered
as
he
elevated
his
stumps
of
hands
i
helpless
but
you
must
take
care
of
them
i
an
old
man
now
said
he
despondingly
i
will
father
i
try
hard
replied
charlie
it
was
cruel
in
them
was
it
son
he
resumed
see
they
made
me
helpless
for
ever
charlie
restrained
the
tears
that
were
forcing
themselves
up
and
rejoined
never
fear
father
i
do
my
best
i
trust
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
take
care
of
you
his
father
did
not
understand
him
his
mind
was
gone
again
and
he
was
staring
vacantly
about
him
charlie
endeavoured
to
recall
his
attention
but
failed
for
he
began
muttering
about
the
mob
and
his
hands
they
were
compelled
to
quit
the
room
and
leave
him
to
himself
as
he
always
became
quiet
sooner
by
being
left
alone
chapter
xxvii
sudbury
we
must
now
admit
our
readers
to
a
consultation
that
is
progressing
between
balch
and
walters
respecting
the
future
of
the
two
garie
children
they
no
doubt
entered
upon
the
conference
with
the
warmest
and
most
earnest
desire
of
promoting
the
children
happiness
but
unfortunately
their
decision
failed
to
produce
the
result
i
scarcely
thought
you
would
have
succeeded
so
well
with
him
said
walters
he
is
such
an
inveterate
scoundrel
depend
upon
it
nothing
but
the
fear
of
the
exposure
resulting
from
a
legal
investigation
would
ever
have
induced
that
scamp
to
let
twelve
thousand
dollars
escape
from
his
clutches
i
am
glad
you
have
secured
that
much
when
we
add
it
to
the
eight
thousand
already
in
my
possession
it
will
place
them
in
very
comfortable
circumstances
even
if
they
never
get
any
more
i
think
we
have
done
very
well
rejoined
balch
we
were
as
much
in
his
power
as
he
was
in
ours
not
in
the
same
way
however
a
legal
investigation
no
matter
how
damaging
it
might
have
been
to
his
reputation
would
not
have
placed
us
in
possession
of
the
property
or
invalidated
his
claim
as
heir
i
think
on
the
whole
we
may
as
well
be
satisfied
and
trust
in
providence
for
the
future
so
now
then
we
will
resume
our
discussion
of
that
matter
we
had
under
consideration
the
other
day
i
can
not
but
think
that
my
plan
is
best
adapted
to
secure
the
happiness
i
sorry
i
can
not
agree
with
you
balch
i
have
tried
to
view
your
plan
in
the
most
favourable
light
yet
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
a
presentiment
that
it
will
result
in
the
ultimate
discovery
of
his
peculiar
position
and
that
most
probably
at
some
time
when
his
happiness
is
dependent
upon
its
concealment
an
undetected
forger
who
is
in
constant
fear
of
being
apprehended
is
happy
in
comparison
with
that
coloured
man
who
attempts
in
this
country
to
hold
a
place
in
the
society
of
whites
by
concealing
his
origin
he
must
live
in
constant
fear
of
exposure
this
dread
will
embitter
every
enjoyment
and
make
him
the
most
miserable
of
men
you
must
admit
rejoined
balch
that
i
have
their
welfare
at
heart
i
have
thought
the
matter
over
and
over
and
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
feel
the
weight
of
your
objections
the
children
are
peculiarly
situated
everything
seems
to
favour
my
views
their
mother
the
only
relative
they
had
whose
african
origin
was
distinguishable
is
dead
and
both
of
them
are
so
exceedingly
fair
that
it
would
never
enter
the
brain
of
any
one
that
they
were
connected
with
coloured
people
by
ties
of
blood
clarence
is
old
enough
to
know
the
importance
of
concealing
the
fact
and
emily
might
be
kept
with
us
until
her
prudence
also
might
be
relied
upon
you
must
acknowledge
that
as
white
persons
they
will
be
better
off
i
admit
answered
walters
that
in
our
land
of
liberty
it
is
of
incalculable
advantage
to
be
white
that
is
beyond
dispute
and
no
one
is
more
painfully
aware
of
it
than
i
often
i
have
heard
men
of
colour
say
they
would
not
be
white
if
they
could
had
no
desire
to
change
their
complexions
i
written
some
down
fools
others
liars
why
continued
he
with
a
sneering
expression
of
countenance
it
is
everything
to
be
white
one
feels
that
at
every
turn
in
our
boasted
free
country
where
all
men
are
upon
an
equality
when
i
look
around
me
and
see
what
i
have
made
myself
in
spite
of
circumstances
and
think
what
i
might
have
been
with
the
same
heart
and
brain
beneath
a
fairer
skin
i
am
almost
tempted
to
curse
the
destiny
that
made
me
what
i
am
time
after
time
when
scraping
toiling
saving
i
have
asked
myself
to
what
purpose
is
it
all
perhaps
that
in
the
future
white
men
may
point
at
and
call
me
sneeringly
nigger
millionaire
or
condescend
to
borrow
money
of
me
ah
often
when
some
white
man
has
been
forced
to
ask
a
loan
at
my
hands
thought
of
shylock
and
his
pound
of
flesh
and
ceased
to
wonder
at
him
there
no
doubt
my
dear
sir
but
what
i
fully
appreciate
the
advantage
of
being
white
yet
with
all
i
have
endured
and
yet
endure
from
day
to
day
i
esteem
myself
happy
in
comparison
with
that
man
who
mingling
in
the
society
of
whites
is
at
the
same
time
aware
that
he
has
african
blood
in
his
veins
and
is
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
ignominiously
hurled
from
his
position
by
the
discovery
of
his
origin
he
is
never
safe
i
have
known
instances
where
parties
have
gone
on
for
years
and
years
undetected
but
some
untoward
circumstance
brings
them
out
at
last
and
down
they
fall
for
ever
walters
my
dear
fellow
you
will
persist
in
looking
upon
his
being
discovered
as
a
thing
of
course
i
see
no
reason
for
the
anticipation
of
any
such
result
i
do
see
how
he
is
to
be
detected
it
may
never
occur
and
do
you
feel
justified
in
consigning
them
to
a
position
which
you
know
by
painful
experience
to
be
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
that
can
be
endured
ought
we
not
to
aid
their
escape
from
it
if
we
can
walters
stood
reflectively
for
some
moments
and
then
exclaimed
make
no
farther
objection
i
would
not
have
the
boy
say
to
me
hereafter
for
your
persisting
in
identifying
me
with
a
degraded
people
i
might
have
been
better
and
happier
than
i
am
however
i
can
not
but
feel
that
concealments
of
this
kind
are
productive
of
more
misery
than
comfort
we
will
agree
to
differ
about
that
walters
and
now
having
your
consent
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
proceed
in
the
matter
with
full
reliance
that
the
future
will
amply
justify
my
choice
well
well
as
i
said
before
i
will
offer
no
further
objection
now
let
me
hear
the
details
of
your
plan
i
have
written
answered
balch
to
eustis
a
friend
of
mine
living
at
sudbury
where
there
is
a
large
preparatory
school
for
boys
at
his
house
i
purpose
placing
clarence
eustis
is
a
most
discreet
man
and
a
person
of
liberal
sentiments
i
feel
that
i
can
confide
everything
to
him
without
the
least
fear
of
his
ever
divulging
a
breath
of
it
he
is
a
gentleman
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
term
and
at
his
house
the
boy
will
have
the
advantage
of
good
society
and
will
associate
with
the
best
people
of
the
place
has
he
a
family
asked
walters
he
is
a
widower
answered
balch
a
maiden
sister
of
his
presides
over
his
establishment
she
will
be
kind
to
clarence
i
am
confident
she
has
a
motherly
soft
heart
and
is
remarkably
fond
of
children
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
he
will
be
very
happy
and
comfortable
there
i
think
it
very
fortunate
walters
he
continued
that
he
has
so
few
coloured
acquaintances
no
boyish
intimacies
to
break
up
and
it
will
be
as
well
to
send
him
away
before
he
has
an
opportunity
of
forming
them
besides
being
here
where
everything
will
be
so
constantly
reviving
the
remembrance
of
his
recent
loss
he
may
grow
melancholy
and
stupid
i
have
several
times
noticed
his
reserve
so
unusual
in
a
child
his
dreadful
loss
and
the
horrors
that
attended
it
have
made
a
deep
impression
stupified
him
to
a
certain
extent
i
think
well
well
we
will
get
him
off
and
once
away
at
school
and
surrounded
by
lively
boys
this
dulness
will
soon
wear
off
the
gentlemen
having
fully
determined
upon
his
being
sent
it
was
proposed
to
bring
him
in
immediately
and
talk
to
him
relative
to
it
he
was
accordingly
sent
for
and
came
into
the
room
placing
himself
beside
the
chair
of
walters
clarence
had
altered
very
much
since
the
death
of
his
parents
his
face
had
grown
thin
and
pale
and
he
was
much
taller
than
when
he
came
to
philadelphia
a
shade
of
melancholy
had
overspread
his
face
there
was
now
in
his
eyes
that
expression
of
intense
sadness
that
characterized
his
mother
you
sent
for
me
he
remarked
inquiringly
to
walters
yes
my
boy
he
rejoined
we
sent
for
you
to
have
a
little
talk
about
school
would
you
like
to
go
to
school
again
oh
yes
answered
clarence
his
face
lighting
up
with
pleasure
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
it
would
be
much
better
than
staying
at
home
all
day
doing
nothing
the
days
are
so
long
concluded
he
with
a
sigh
ah
we
will
soon
remedy
that
rejoined
balch
when
you
go
to
sudbury
sudbury
repeated
clarence
with
surprise
where
is
that
i
thought
you
meant
to
go
to
school
here
oh
no
my
dear
said
balch
i
do
know
of
any
good
school
here
such
as
you
would
like
we
wish
to
send
you
to
a
place
where
you
will
enjoy
yourself
finely
where
you
will
have
a
number
of
boys
for
companions
in
your
studies
and
pleasures
and
is
em
going
with
me
he
asked
oh
no
that
is
not
possible
it
is
a
school
for
boys
exclusively
you
ca
take
your
sister
there
rejoined
walters
then
i
do
want
to
go
said
clarence
decidedly
i
do
want
to
go
where
i
ca
take
em
with
me
balch
exchanged
glances
with
walters
and
looked
quite
perplexed
at
this
new
opposition
to
his
scheme
nothing
daunted
however
by
this
difficulty
he
by
dint
of
much
talking
and
persuasion
brought
clarence
to
look
upon
the
plan
with
favour
and
to
consent
reluctantly
to
go
without
his
sister
but
the
most
delicate
part
of
the
whole
business
was
yet
to
come
they
must
impress
upon
the
child
the
necessity
of
concealing
the
fact
that
he
was
of
african
origin
neither
seemed
to
know
how
to
approach
the
subject
clarence
however
involuntarily
made
an
opening
for
them
by
inquiring
if
emily
was
to
go
to
miss
jordan
school
again
no
my
dear
answered
balch
miss
jordan
wo
permit
her
to
attend
school
there
why
asked
clarence
because
she
is
a
coloured
child
rejoined
balch
now
clarence
he
continued
you
are
old
enough
i
presume
to
know
the
difference
that
exists
between
the
privileges
and
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
whites
and
those
that
are
at
the
command
of
the
coloured
people
white
boys
can
go
to
better
schools
and
they
can
enter
college
and
become
professional
men
lawyers
doctors
c
or
they
may
be
merchants
in
fact
they
can
be
anything
they
please
coloured
people
can
enjoy
none
of
these
advantages
they
are
shut
out
from
them
entirely
now
which
of
the
two
would
you
rather
be
coloured
or
white
i
should
much
rather
be
white
of
course
answered
clarence
but
i
am
coloured
and
ca
help
myself
said
he
innocently
but
my
child
we
are
going
to
send
you
where
it
is
not
known
that
you
are
coloured
and
you
must
tell
it
because
if
it
became
known
you
would
be
expelled
from
the
school
as
you
were
from
miss
jordan
i
did
know
we
were
expelled
rejoined
clarence
i
know
she
sent
us
home
but
i
could
not
understand
what
it
was
for
i
afraid
they
will
send
me
from
the
other
school
wo
they
know
i
am
coloured
no
my
child
i
do
think
they
will
discover
it
unless
you
should
be
foolish
enough
to
tell
it
yourself
in
which
case
both
walters
and
myself
would
be
very
much
grieved
but
suppose
some
one
should
ask
me
suggested
clarence
no
one
will
ever
ask
you
such
a
question
said
balch
impatiently
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
be
silent
yourself
on
the
subject
should
any
of
your
schoolmates
ever
make
inquiries
respecting
your
parents
all
you
have
to
answer
is
they
were
from
georgia
and
you
are
an
orphan
clarence
eyes
began
to
moisten
as
balch
spoke
of
his
parents
and
after
a
few
moments
he
asked
with
some
hesitation
am
i
never
to
speak
of
mother
i
love
to
talk
of
mother
yes
my
dear
of
course
you
can
talk
of
your
mother
answered
balch
with
great
embarrassment
only
you
know
my
child
you
need
not
enter
into
particulars
as
regards
her
appearance
that
is
you
ah
need
not
say
she
was
a
coloured
woman
you
say
that
you
understand
yes
sir
answered
clarence
very
well
then
bear
that
in
mind
you
must
know
clarence
continued
he
that
this
concealment
is
necessary
for
your
welfare
or
we
would
not
require
it
and
you
must
let
me
impress
it
upon
you
that
it
is
requisite
that
you
attend
strictly
to
our
directions
walters
remained
silent
during
most
of
this
conversation
he
felt
a
repugnance
to
force
upon
the
child
a
concealment
the
beneficial
results
of
which
were
the
reverse
of
obvious
so
he
merely
gave
clarence
some
useful
advice
respecting
his
general
conduct
and
then
permitted
him
to
leave
the
room
the
morning
fixed
upon
for
their
departure
for
sudbury
turned
out
to
be
cold
and
cheerless
and
clarence
felt
very
gloomy
as
he
sat
beside
his
sister
at
their
early
breakfast
of
which
he
was
not
able
to
eat
a
morsel
do
eat
something
clary
said
she
coaxingly
only
look
what
nice
buckwheat
cakes
these
are
cook
got
up
ever
so
early
on
purpose
to
bake
them
for
you
no
sis
he
replied
i
ca
eat
i
feel
so
miserable
everything
chokes
me
well
eat
a
biscuit
then
she
continued
as
she
buttered
it
and
laid
it
on
his
plate
do
eat
it
now
more
to
please
her
than
from
a
desire
to
eat
he
forced
down
a
few
mouthfuls
of
it
and
drank
a
little
tea
then
laying
his
arm
round
her
neck
he
said
em
you
must
try
hard
to
learn
to
write
soon
so
that
i
may
hear
from
you
at
least
once
a
week
oh
i
shall
soon
know
how
i
in
g
and
h
now
aunt
esther
she
says
i
may
call
her
aunt
esther
teaches
me
every
day
ai
i
getting
on
nicely
oh
yes
you
learn
very
fast
said
esther
encouragingly
as
she
completed
the
pile
of
sandwiches
she
was
preparing
for
the
young
traveller
then
turning
to
look
at
the
timepiece
on
the
mantel
she
exclaimed
quarter
to
seven
how
time
flies
balch
will
soon
be
here
you
must
be
all
ready
clarence
so
as
not
to
keep
him
waiting
a
moment
clarence
arose
from
his
scarcely
tasted
meal
began
slowly
to
put
on
his
overcoat
and
make
himself
ready
for
the
journey
em
tied
on
the
warm
woollen
kissing
him
on
each
cheek
as
she
did
so
and
whilst
they
were
thus
engaged
balch
drove
up
to
the
door
charlie
who
had
come
down
to
see
him
off
tried
with
his
mouth
full
of
buckwheat
cake
to
say
something
consolatory
and
gave
it
as
his
experience
that
a
fellow
soon
got
over
that
sort
of
thing
that
separations
must
occur
sometimes
and
on
the
whole
endeavoured
to
talk
in
a
very
manly
and
philosophical
strain
but
his
precepts
and
practice
proved
to
be
at
utter
variance
for
when
the
moment
of
separation
really
came
and
he
saw
the
tearful
embrace
of
em
and
her
brother
he
caught
the
infection
of
grief
and
cried
as
heartily
as
the
best
of
them
there
was
but
little
time
however
to
spare
for
and
the
young
traveller
and
his
guardian
were
soon
whirling
over
the
road
towards
new
york
by
a
singular
chance
clarence
found
himself
in
the
same
car
in
which
he
had
formerly
rode
when
they
were
on
their
way
to
philadelphia
he
recognized
it
by
some
peculiar
paintings
on
the
panel
of
the
door
and
the
ornamental
border
of
the
ceiling
this
brought
back
a
tide
of
memories
and
he
began
contrasting
that
journey
with
the
present
opposite
was
the
seat
on
which
his
parents
had
sat
in
the
bloom
of
health
and
elate
with
joyous
anticipations
he
remembered
oh
so
well
his
father
pleasant
smile
his
mother
soft
and
gentle
voice
both
now
were
gone
death
had
made
rigid
that
smiling
face
her
soft
voice
was
hushed
for
ever
and
the
cold
snow
was
resting
on
their
bosoms
in
the
little
churchyard
miles
away
truly
the
contrast
between
now
and
then
was
extremely
saddening
and
the
child
bowed
his
head
upon
the
seat
and
sobbed
in
bitter
grief
what
is
the
matter
asked
balch
not
crying
again
i
hope
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
a
man
and
that
we
were
not
to
have
any
more
tears
come
continued
he
patting
him
encouragingly
on
the
back
cheer
up
you
are
going
to
a
delightful
place
where
you
will
find
a
number
of
agreeable
playmates
and
have
a
deal
of
fun
and
enjoy
yourself
amazingly
but
it
wo
be
replied
clarence
true
replied
balch
a
little
touched
it
wo
seem
so
at
first
but
you
soon
like
it
i
guarantee
that
clarence
was
not
permitted
to
indulge
his
grief
to
any
great
extent
for
balch
soon
succeeded
in
interesting
him
in
the
various
objects
that
they
passed
on
the
way
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
they
arrived
at
their
destination
and
clarence
alighted
from
the
cars
cold
fatigued
and
spiritless
there
had
been
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
a
few
days
previous
and
the
town
of
sudbury
which
was
built
upon
the
shone
white
and
sparkling
in
the
clear
winter
moonlight
it
was
the
first
time
that
clarence
had
ever
seen
the
ground
covered
with
snow
and
he
could
not
restrain
his
admiration
at
the
novel
spectacle
it
presented
to
him
oh
look
oh
do
look
balch
he
exclaimed
how
beautifully
white
it
looks
it
seems
as
if
the
town
was
built
of
salt
it
was
indeed
a
pretty
sight
near
them
stood
a
clump
of
trees
their
gnarled
limbs
covered
with
snow
and
brilliant
with
the
countless
icicles
that
glistened
like
precious
stones
in
the
bright
light
that
was
reflected
upon
them
from
the
windows
of
the
station
a
little
farther
on
between
them
and
the
town
flowed
a
small
stream
the
waters
of
which
were
dimpling
and
sparkling
in
the
moonlight
beside
its
banks
arose
stately
and
from
their
many
windows
hundreds
of
lights
were
shining
behind
them
tier
above
tier
were
the
houses
of
the
town
and
crowning
the
hill
was
the
academy
with
its
great
dome
gleaming
on
its
top
like
a
silver
cap
upon
a
mountain
of
snow
the
merry
and
the
crisp
tramp
of
the
horses
upon
the
frozen
ground
were
all
calculated
to
make
a
striking
impression
on
one
beholding
such
a
scene
for
the
first
time
clarence
followed
balch
into
the
sleigh
delighted
and
bewildered
with
the
surrounding
objects
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horses
they
clattered
over
the
bridge
dashed
swiftly
through
the
town
and
in
a
very
short
period
arrived
at
the
dwelling
of
eustis
the
horses
had
scarcely
stopped
when
the
door
flew
open
and
a
stream
of
light
from
the
hall
shone
down
the
pathway
to
the
gate
eustis
came
out
on
the
step
to
welcome
them
after
greeting
balch
warmly
he
took
clarence
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
the
room
where
his
sister
was
sitting
here
is
our
little
friend
said
he
to
her
as
she
arose
and
approached
them
try
and
get
him
warm
ada
his
hands
are
like
ice
miss
ada
bell
welcomed
clarence
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
assisted
him
to
remove
his
coat
unfastened
his
woollen
and
smoothed
down
his
glossy
black
hair
then
warming
a
napkin
she
wrapped
it
round
his
benumbed
hands
and
held
them
in
her
own
until
the
circulation
was
restored
and
they
were
supple
and
comfortable
again
miss
ada
bell
appeared
to
be
about
she
had
good
regular
features
hazel
eyes
and
long
chestnut
curls
a
mouth
with
the
sweetest
expression
and
a
voice
so
winning
and
affectionate
in
its
tone
that
it
went
straight
to
the
hearts
of
all
that
listened
to
its
music
had
you
a
pleasant
journey
she
asked
it
was
rather
cold
answered
clarence
and
i
am
not
accustomed
to
frosty
weather
and
did
you
leave
all
your
friends
well
she
continued
as
she
chafed
his
hands
quite
well
i
thank
you
he
replied
i
hear
you
have
a
little
sister
were
you
not
sorry
to
leave
her
behind
this
question
called
up
the
tearful
face
of
little
em
and
her
last
embrace
he
could
not
answer
he
only
raised
his
mournful
dark
eyes
to
the
face
of
miss
ada
and
as
he
looked
at
her
they
grew
moist
and
a
tear
sparkled
on
his
long
lashes
miss
ada
felt
that
she
had
touched
a
tender
chord
so
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
his
forehead
remarking
you
have
a
good
face
clarence
and
no
doubt
an
equally
good
heart
we
shall
get
on
charmingly
together
i
know
those
kind
words
won
the
orphan
heart
and
from
that
day
forth
clarence
loved
her
tea
was
soon
brought
upon
the
table
and
they
all
earnestly
engaged
in
the
discussion
of
the
various
refreshments
that
miss
ada
larder
afforded
everything
was
so
fresh
and
nicely
flavoured
that
both
the
travellers
ate
very
heartily
then
being
much
fatigued
with
their
two
days
journey
they
seized
an
early
opportunity
to
retire
here
we
leave
clarence
for
many
years
the
boy
will
have
become
a
man
ere
we
him
and
till
then
we
bid
him
adieu
chapter
xxviii
charlie
seeks
employment
charlie
had
been
at
borne
some
weeks
comparatively
idle
at
least
he
so
considered
himself
as
the
little
he
did
in
the
way
of
collecting
rents
and
looking
up
small
accounts
for
walters
he
regarded
as
next
to
nothing
it
not
occupying
half
his
time
a
part
of
each
day
he
spent
in
attendance
on
his
father
who
seemed
better
satisfied
with
his
ministrations
than
with
those
of
his
wife
and
daughters
this
proved
to
be
very
fortunate
for
all
parties
as
it
enabled
the
girls
to
concentrate
their
attention
on
their
sewing
of
which
they
had
a
vast
deal
on
hand
one
day
when
esther
and
charlie
were
walking
out
together
the
latter
remarked
ess
i
wish
i
could
find
some
regular
and
profitable
employment
or
was
apprenticed
to
some
good
trade
that
would
enable
me
to
assist
mother
a
little
i
even
go
to
service
if
i
could
do
no
better
anything
but
being
idle
whilst
you
are
all
so
hard
at
work
it
makes
me
feel
very
uncomfortable
i
would
be
very
glad
if
you
could
procure
some
suitable
employment
i
do
wish
you
to
go
to
service
again
that
is
out
of
the
question
of
whom
have
you
made
inquiry
respecting
a
situation
oh
of
lots
of
people
they
can
tell
me
of
any
number
of
families
who
are
in
want
of
a
footman
but
no
one
appears
to
know
of
a
who
is
willing
to
receive
a
black
boy
as
an
apprentice
to
a
respectable
calling
it
too
provoking
i
really
think
ess
that
the
majority
of
white
folks
imagine
that
we
are
only
fit
for
servants
and
incapable
of
being
rendered
useful
in
any
other
capacity
if
that
terrible
misfortune
had
not
befallen
father
i
should
have
learned
his
trade
ah
sighed
esther
but
for
that
we
should
all
have
been
happier
but
charlie
she
added
how
do
you
know
that
you
can
not
obtain
any
other
employment
than
that
of
a
servant
have
you
ever
applied
personally
to
any
one
no
esther
i
have
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
white
masters
receive
coloured
apprentices
i
think
a
great
deal
of
that
is
taken
for
granted
rejoined
esther
try
some
one
yourself
i
only
wish
i
knew
of
any
one
to
try
responded
charlie
i
hazard
the
experiment
at
any
rate
look
over
the
newspaper
in
the
morning
advised
esther
there
are
always
a
great
many
wants
advertised
amongst
them
you
may
perhaps
find
something
suitable
well
i
will
ess
now
then
we
wo
talk
about
that
any
more
pray
tell
me
if
i
not
too
inquisitive
what
do
you
purpose
buying
with
your
money
a
eh
he
asked
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
esther
blushed
and
sighed
as
she
answered
no
charlie
that
is
all
over
for
the
present
i
told
him
yesterday
i
could
not
think
of
marrying
now
whilst
we
are
all
so
unsettled
it
grieved
me
to
do
it
charlie
but
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
cad
and
i
are
going
to
add
our
savings
to
mother
that
combined
with
what
we
shall
receive
for
father
tools
c
will
be
sufficient
to
furnish
another
house
and
as
soon
as
we
can
succeed
in
that
we
will
leave
walters
as
it
is
embarrassing
to
remain
under
present
circumstances
and
what
is
to
become
of
little
em
she
surely
wo
remain
alone
with
him
walters
has
proposed
that
when
we
procure
a
house
she
shall
come
and
board
with
us
he
wants
us
to
take
one
of
his
houses
and
offers
some
fabulous
sum
for
the
child
board
which
it
would
be
unreasonable
in
us
to
take
dear
good
man
he
is
always
complaining
that
we
are
too
proud
and
wo
let
him
assist
us
when
he
might
if
we
find
a
suitable
house
i
shall
be
delighted
to
have
her
i
love
the
child
for
her
mother
sake
and
her
own
i
wonder
if
they
will
ever
send
her
away
as
they
did
clarence
asked
charlie
i
do
not
know
she
rejoined
balch
told
me
that
he
should
not
insist
upon
it
if
the
child
was
unwilling
the
next
day
charlie
purchased
all
the
morning
papers
he
could
obtain
and
sat
down
to
look
over
the
list
of
wants
there
were
hungry
people
in
want
of
professed
cooks
divers
demands
for
black
or
white
special
inquiries
for
waiters
and
footmen
in
which
the
same
disregard
of
colour
was
observable
advertisements
for
partners
in
all
sorts
of
businesses
and
for
journeymen
in
every
department
of
mechanical
operations
then
there
were
milliners
wanted
sempstresses
and
even
theatrical
assistants
but
nowhere
in
the
long
columns
could
he
discover
wanted
a
boy
charlie
searched
them
over
and
over
but
the
stubborn
fact
stared
him
in
the
face
there
evidently
were
no
boys
wanted
and
he
at
length
concluded
that
he
either
belonged
to
a
very
useless
class
or
that
there
was
an
unaccountable
prejudice
existing
in
the
city
against
the
rising
generation
charlie
folded
up
the
papers
with
a
despairing
sigh
and
walked
to
the
to
mail
a
letter
to
bird
that
he
had
written
the
previous
evening
having
noticed
a
number
of
young
men
examining
some
written
notices
that
were
posted
up
he
joined
the
group
and
finding
it
was
a
list
of
wants
he
eagerly
read
them
over
to
his
great
delight
he
found
there
was
one
individual
at
least
who
thought
boys
could
be
rendered
useful
to
society
and
who
had
written
as
follows
wanted
a
youth
of
about
thirteen
years
of
age
who
writes
a
good
hand
and
is
willing
to
make
himself
useful
in
an
address
box
no
i
their
man
said
charlie
to
himself
as
he
finished
perusing
it
just
the
person
i
go
home
and
write
to
them
immediately
and
accordingly
he
hastened
back
to
the
house
sat
down
and
wrote
a
reply
to
the
advertisement
he
then
privately
showed
it
to
esther
who
praised
the
writing
and
composition
and
pronounced
the
whole
very
neatly
done
charlie
then
walked
down
to
the
to
deposit
his
precious
reply
and
after
dropping
it
into
the
brass
mouth
of
the
he
gazed
in
after
it
and
saw
it
glide
slowly
down
into
the
abyss
below
how
many
more
had
stopped
that
day
to
add
their
contributions
to
the
mass
which
charlie
letter
now
joined
merchants
on
the
brink
of
ruin
had
deposited
missives
whose
answer
would
make
or
break
them
others
had
dropped
upon
the
swelling
heap
tidings
that
would
make
poor
men
rich
rich
men
richer
maidens
came
with
delicately
written
notes
perfumed
and
eloquent
with
love
and
cast
them
amidst
invoices
and
bills
of
lading
letters
of
condolence
and
notes
of
congratulation
jostled
each
other
as
they
slid
down
the
brass
throat
widowed
mothers
tender
epistles
to
wandering
sons
the
letters
of
fond
wives
to
absent
husbands
erring
daughters
last
appeals
to
outraged
parents
offers
of
marriage
invitations
to
funerals
hope
and
despair
joy
and
sorrow
misfortune
and
success
had
glided
in
one
almost
unbroken
stream
down
that
and
insatiable
brass
throat
charlie
gave
one
more
look
at
the
opening
then
sauntered
homeward
building
by
the
way
houses
of
fabulous
dimensions
with
the
income
he
anticipated
from
the
situation
if
he
succeeded
in
procuring
it
throughout
the
next
day
he
was
in
a
state
of
feverish
anxiety
and
expectation
and
ellis
two
or
three
times
inquired
the
meaning
of
the
mysterious
whisperings
and
glances
that
were
exchanged
between
him
and
esther
the
day
wore
away
and
yet
no
answer
the
next
came
and
passed
still
no
communication
and
charlie
had
given
up
in
despair
when
he
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
following
twining
western
and
twining
will
be
much
obliged
to
charles
ellis
if
he
will
call
at
their
office
morning
at
eleven
as
they
would
like
to
communicate
further
with
him
respecting
a
situation
in
their
establishment
charlie
flew
up
stairs
to
esther
room
and
rushing
in
precipitately
exclaimed
oh
ess
i
got
it
i
got
it
see
here
he
shouted
waving
the
note
over
his
head
hurrah
hurrah
just
read
it
ess
only
just
read
it
how
can
i
charlie
said
she
with
a
smile
if
you
hold
it
in
your
hand
and
dance
about
in
that
frantic
style
give
it
me
there
now
keep
quiet
a
moment
and
let
me
read
it
after
perusing
it
attentively
esther
added
do
be
too
sanguine
charlie
you
see
by
the
tenor
of
the
note
that
the
situation
is
not
promised
you
they
only
wish
to
see
you
respecting
it
you
may
not
secure
it
after
all
some
obstacle
may
arise
of
which
we
are
not
at
present
aware
go
on
old
raven
croak
away
said
charlie
giving
her
at
the
same
time
a
facetious
poke
there
many
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
she
added
oh
ess
he
rejoined
do
throw
cold
water
on
a
fellow
in
that
style
do
harbour
so
many
doubts
do
you
think
they
would
take
the
trouble
to
write
if
they
did
not
intend
to
give
me
the
situation
go
away
old
raven
concluded
he
kissing
her
and
do
let
us
have
any
more
croaking
charlie
was
bounding
from
the
room
when
he
was
stopped
by
his
sister
who
begged
him
not
to
say
anything
to
their
mother
respecting
it
but
wait
until
they
knew
the
issue
of
the
interview
and
if
he
secured
the
situation
it
would
be
a
very
agreeable
surprise
to
her
we
will
now
visit
in
company
with
the
reader
the
spacious
offices
of
twining
western
and
twining
where
we
shall
find
western
about
consigning
to
the
basket
a
large
pile
of
letters
this
gentleman
was
very
fashionably
dressed
of
dark
complexion
with
the
languid
air
and
drawling
intonation
of
a
southerner
at
an
adjoining
desk
sat
an
elderly
gentleman
who
was
looking
over
his
spectacles
at
the
movements
of
his
partner
what
a
mass
of
letters
you
are
about
to
destroy
he
remarked
western
took
from
his
month
the
cigar
he
was
smoking
and
after
puffing
from
between
his
lips
a
thin
wreath
of
smoke
replied
some
of
the
most
atwocious
scwawls
that
man
ever
attempted
to
pewuse
weplies
to
the
advertisement

by
charlie
both
the
gentlemen
rose
and
twining
offered
her
a
chair
esther
accepted
the
proffered
seat
threw
up
her
veil
and
said
in
a
slightly
embarrassed
tone
my
brother
here
took
the
liberty
of
replying

advertisement

you
were
kind
enough
to
request

twining
in
a
tone
of
surprise
yes

here

said
she
extending
it
to
him
twining
glanced
over
it
and
remarked
this
is

taking
charlie
letter
from
the
desk
of
western
he
asked
in
a
doubting
tone

composition

charlie

it

at

at
esther
and
lastly
at
each
other
but
neither
seemed
able
to
say
anything
and
evident
embarrassment
existed
on
both
sides
and
so
you
thought
you
would
twy
for
the
situation
at
last
remarked
western
to
charlie
yes
sir
he
answered
i
was
and
am
very
anxious
to
obtain
some
employment
have
you
a
father
asked
twining
yes
sir
but
he
was
badly
injured
by
the
mob
last
summer
and
will
never
be
able
to
work
again
that
a
pity
said
western
sympathisingly
and
what
have
you
been
doing
nothing
very
recently
i
broke
my
arm
last
spring
and
was
obliged
to
go
into
the
country
for
my
health
i
have
not
long
returned
do
your
pawents
keep
house
not
at
present
we
are
staying
with
a
friend
our
house
was
burned
down
by
the
rioters
this
conversation
recalled
so
vividly
their
past
trials
that
esther
eyes
grew
watery
and
she
dropped
her
veil
to
conceal
a
tear
that
was
trembling
on
the
lid
how
vewy
unfortunate
said
western
sympathisingly
vewy
twying
indeed
then
burying
his
chin
in
his
hand
he
sat
silently
regarding
them
for
a
moment
or
two
have
you
come
to
any
decision
about
taking
him
esther
at
last
ventured
to
ask
of
twining
taking
him
oh
dear
me
i
had
almost
forgot
charles
let
me
see
you
write
something
here
take
this
seat
charlie
sat
down
as
directed
and
dashed
off
a
few
lines
which
he
handed
to
twining
who
looked
at
it
over
and
over
then
rising
he
beckoned
to
his
partner
to
follow
him
into
an
adjoining
room
well
what
do
you
say
asked
western
after
they
had
closed
the
door
behind
them
do
you
think
we
had
better
engage
him
engage
exclaimed
twining
why
you
surprise
me
western
the
thing
absurd
engage
a
coloured
boy
as
under
clerk
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
have
often
drawled
western
there
are
the
gweatest
number
of
them
in
new
orleans
ah
but
new
orleans
is
a
different
place
such
a
thing
never
occurred
in
philadelphia
well
let
us
cweate
a
pwecedent
then
the
boy
wites
wemarkably
well
and
will
no
doubt
suit
us
exactly
it
will
be
a
chawity
to
take
him
we
need
not
care
what
others
say
evewybody
knows
who
we
are
and
what
we
are
no
western
i
know
the
north
better
than
you
do
it
would
answer
at
all
here
we
can
not
take
the
boy
it
is
impossible
it
would
create
a
rumpus
amongst
the
clerks
who
would
all
feel
dreadfully
insulted
by
our
placing
a
nigger
child
on
an
equality
with
them
i
assure
you
the
thing
is
out
of
the
question
well
i
must
say
you
northern
people
are
perfectly
incompwehensible
you
pay
taxes
to
have
niggers
educated
and
made
fit
for
such
places
and
then
wo
let
them
fill
them
when
they
are
pwepared
to
do
so
i
shall
leave
you
then
to
tell
them
we
ca
take
him
i
doosed
sowwy
for
it
i
like
his
looks
whilst
western
and
his
partner
were
discussing
in
one
room
charlie
and
esther
were
awaiting
with
some
anxiety
their
decision
in
the
other
i
think
they
are
going
to
take
me
said
charlie
you
saw
how
struck
they
appeared
to
be
with
the
writing
they
admired
it
i
know
my
dear
but
do
be
too
sanguine
i
feel
they
are
going
to
take
me
repeated
he
with
a
hopeful
countenance
esther
made
no
reply
and
they
remained
in
silence
until
twining
returned
to
the
room
after
two
or
three
preparatory
ahems
he
said
to
esther
i
should
like
to
take
your
brother
very
much
but
you
see
in
consequence
of
there
being
so
much
excitement
just
now
relative
to
abolitionism
and
kindred
subjects
that
my
partner
and
myself
that
is
i
and
western
think
or
rather
feel
that
just
now
it
would
be
rather
awkward
for
us
to
receive
him
we
should
like
to
take
him
but
his
miss
his
complexion
is
a
objection
it
grieves
me
to
be
obliged
to
tell
you
this
but
i
think
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
most
prudent
for
us
to
decline
to
receive
him
we
are
sorry
but
our
clerks
are
all
young
men
and
have
a
great
deal
of
prejudice
and
i
am
sure
he
would
be
neither
comfortable
nor
happy
with
them
if
i
can
serve
you
in
any
other
way
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
do
that
i
am
aware
of
said
esther
rising
i
thank
you
and
am
sorry
that
we
have
occupied
so
much
of
your
time
oh
do
mention
it
said
twining
evidently
happy
to
get
rid
of
them
and
opening
the
door
he
bowed
them
out
of
the
office
the
two
departed
sadly
and
they
walked
on
for
some
distance
in
silence
at
last
esther
pressed
his
hand
and
in
a
choking
voice
exclaimed
charlie
my
dear
boy
i
give
my
life
if
it
would
change
your
complexion
if
it
would
make
you
white
poor
fellow
your
battle
of
life
will
be
a
hard
one
to
fight
i
know
it
ess
but
i
should
care
to
be
white
if
i
knew
i
would
not
have
a
dear
old
ess
like
you
for
a
sister
he
answered
pressing
her
hand
affectionately
i
do
intend
to
be
conquered
he
continued
i
fight
it
out
to
the
last
this
wo
discourage
me
i
keep
on
trying
said
he
determinedly
if
one
wo
perhaps
another
will
for
two
or
three
days
charlie
could
hear
of
nothing
that
would
be
at
all
suitable
for
him
at
last
one
morning
he
saw
an
advertisement
for
a
youth
to
learn
the
engraver
business
one
who
had
some
knowledge
of
drawing
preferred
to
apply
at
thomas
blatchford
engraver
thomas
blatchford
repeated
walters
as
charlie
read
it
over
why
that
is
blatchford
the
abolitionist
i
think
you
have
some
chance
there
most
decidedly
i
would
advise
you
to
take
those
sketches
of
yours
and
apply
at
once
charlie
ran
upstairs
and
selecting
the
of
his
drawings
put
them
in
a
neat
portfolio
and
without
saying
anything
to
esther
or
his
mother
hastened
away
to
blatchford
he
was
shown
into
a
room
where
a
gentleman
was
sitting
at
a
table
examining
some
engraved
plates
is
this
mr
blatchford
asked
charlie
that
is
my
name
my
little
man
do
you
want
to
see
me
he
kindly
inquired
yes
sir
you
advertised
for
a
boy
to
learn
the
engraving
business
i
believe
well
and
what
then
i
have
come
to
apply
for
the
situation
apply
said
he
in
a
tone
of
surprise
yes
sir
faltered
charlie
walters
recommended
me
to
do
so
ah
you
know
walters
then
he
rejoined
yes
sir
he
is
a
great
friend
of
my
father
we
are
living
with
him
at
present
what
have
you
in
your
portfolio
there
enquired
blatchford
charlie
spread
before
him
the
sketches
he
had
made
during
the
summer
and
also
some
ornamental
designs
suitable
for
the
of
books
why
these
are
excellently
well
done
exclaimed
he
after
examining
them
attentively
who
taught
you
charlie
hereupon
briefly
related
his
acquaintance
with
the
artist
and
his
efforts
to
obtain
employment
and
their
results
besides
many
other
circumstances
connected
with
himself
and
family
blatchford
became
deeply
interested
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
conversation
delighted
charlie
by
informing
him
that
if
he
and
his
mother
could
agree
as
to
terms
he
should
be
glad
to
receive
him
as
an
apprentice
charlie
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
ears
and
leaving
his
portfolio
on
the
table
was
hastening
away
stop
stop
cried
blatchford
with
a
smile
you
have
not
heard
all
i
wish
to
say
i
would
be
much
obliged
to
your
mother
if
she
would
call
at
my
house
this
evening
and
then
we
can
settle
the
matter
definitely
charlie
seemed
to
tread
on
air
as
he
walked
home
flying
up
to
esther
his
usual
confidant
be
related
to
her
the
whole
affair
and
gave
at
great
length
his
conversation
with
blatchford
that
looks
something
like
said
she
i
am
delighted
with
the
prospect
that
is
opening
to
you
let
us
go
and
tell
mother
and
accordingly
off
they
both
started
to
carry
the
agreeable
intelligence
to
ellis
that
evening
charlie
his
mother
and
walters
went
to
the
house
of
blatchford
they
were
most
kindly
received
and
all
the
arrangements
made
for
charlie
apprenticeship
he
was
to
remain
one
month
on
trial
and
if
at
the
end
of
that
period
all
parties
were
satisfied
he
was
to
be
formally
indentured
charlie
looked
forward
impatiently
to
the
following
monday
on
which
day
he
was
to
commence
his
apprenticeship
in
the
intervening
time
he
held
daily
conferences
with
kinch
as
he
felt
their
intimacy
would
receive
a
slight
check
after
he
entered
upon
his
new
pursuit
look
here
old
fellow
said
charlie
it
wo
do
for
you
to
be
lounging
on
the
of
the
office
nor
be
whistling
for
me
under
the
windows
blatchford
spoke
particularly
against
my
having
playmates
around
in
work
hours
evenings
i
shall
always
be
at
home
and
then
you
can
come
and
see
me
as
often
as
you
like
since
his
visit
to
warmouth
charlie
had
been
much
more
particular
respecting
his
personal
appearance
dressed
neater
and
was
much
more
careful
of
his
clothes
he
had
also
given
up
marbles
and
tried
to
persuade
kinch
to
do
the
same
i
cut
marbles
kinch
said
he
to
him
one
evening
when
they
were
walking
together
if
i
were
you
it
makes
one
such
a
fright
covers
one
with
and
dirt
from
head
to
foot
and
another
thing
kinch
you
have
an
abundance
of
good
clothes
do
wear
them
and
try
and
look
more
like
a
gentleman
dear
me
said
kinch
rolling
up
the
white
of
his
eyes
just
listen
how
we
are
going
on
had
i
better
get
an
and
pair
of
light
kid
gloves
oh
kinch
said
charlie
gravely
i
not
joking
i
mean
what
i
say
you
do
know
how
far
rough
looks
and
an
untidy
person
go
against
one
i
do
wish
you
would
try
and
keep
yourself
decent
well
there
then
i
will
answered
kinch
but
charlie
i
afraid
with
your
travelling
and
one
thing
or
other
you
will
forget
your
old
playmate
and
get
above
him
charlie
eyes
moistened
and
with
a
boy
impulsiveness
he
threw
his
arm
over
kinch
shoulder
and
exclaimed
with
emphasis
never
old
fellow
never
not
as
long
as
my
name
is
charlie
ellis
you
must
be
hurt
at
what
i
said
kinch
i
think
more
of
these
things
than
i
used
to
i
see
the
importance
of
them
i
find
that
any
one
who
wants
to
get
on
must
be
particular
in
little
things
as
well
great
and
i
must
try
and
be
a
man
now
for
you
know
things
do
glide
on
as
smoothly
with
us
as
they
used
i
often
think
of
our
fun
in
the
old
house
ah
perhaps
we
have
good
times
in
another
of
our
own
yet
and
with
this
charlie
and
his
friend
separated
for
the
night
chapter
xxix
clouds
and
sunshine
the
important
monday
at
length
arrived
and
charlie
hastened
to
the
office
of
blatchford
which
he
reached
before
the
hour
for
commencing
labour
he
found
some
dozen
or
more
journeymen
assembled
in
the
and
noticed
that
upon
his
entrance
there
was
an
interchange
of
significant
glances
and
once
or
twice
he
overheard
the
whisper
of
nigger
blatchford
was
engaged
in
discussing
some
business
matter
with
a
gentleman
and
did
not
observe
the
agitation
that
charlie
entrance
had
occasioned
the
conversation
having
terminated
the
gentleman
took
up
the
morning
paper
and
blatchford
noticing
charlie
said
ah
you
have
come
and
in
good
time
too
wheeler
he
continued
turning
to
one
of
the
workmen
i
want
you
to
take
this
boy
under
your
especial
charge
give
him
a
seat
at
your
window
and
overlook
his
work
at
this
there
was
a
general
uprising
of
the
workmen
who
commenced
throwing
off
their
caps
and
aprons
what
is
all
this
for
asked
blatchford
in
astonishment
why
this
commotion
we
wo
work
with
niggers
cried
one
no
nigger
apprentices
cried
another
and
no
niggers
no
niggers
was
echoed
from
all
parts
of
the
room
silence
cried
blatchford
stamping
violently
silence
every
one
of
you
as
soon
as
partial
order
was
restored
he
turned
to
wheeler
and
demanded
what
is
the
occasion
of
all
this
tumult
what
does
it
mean
why
sir
it
means
just
this
the
men
and
boys
discovered
that
you
intended
to
take
a
nigger
apprentice
and
have
made
up
their
minds
if
you
do
they
will
quit
in
a
body
it
can
not
be
possible
exclaimed
the
employer
that
any
man
or
boy
in
my
establishment
has
room
in
his
heart
for
such
narrow
contemptible
prejudices
can
it
be
that
you
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
an
inoffensive
child
of
an
opportunity
of
earning
his
bread
in
a
respectable
manner
come
let
me
persuade
you
the
boy
is
and
educated
damn
his
behaviour
and
education
responded
a
burly
fellow
let
him
be
a
barber
or
that
is
all
niggers
are
good
for
if
he
comes
we
go
that
so
ai
it
boys
there
was
a
general
response
of
approval
to
this
appeal
and
blatchford
seeing
the
utter
uselessness
of
further
parleying
left
the
room
followed
by
charlie
and
the
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
been
conversing
blatchford
was
placed
in
a
most
disagreeable
position
by
this
revolt
on
the
part
of
his
workmen
he
had
just
received
large
orders
from
some
new
banks
which
were
commencing
operations
and
a
general
disruption
of
his
establishment
at
that
moment
would
have
ruined
him
to
accede
to
his
workmen
demands
he
must
do
violence
to
his
own
conscience
but
he
dared
not
sacrifice
his
business
and
bring
ruin
on
himself
and
family
even
though
he
was
right
what
would
you
do
burrell
he
asked
of
the
gentleman
who
had
followed
them
out
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
you
must
do
you
must
ruin
yourself
for
the
sake
of
your
principles
you
will
have
to
abandon
the
lad
the
other
alternative
is
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
well
charles
you
see
how
it
is
said
blatchford
reluctantly
charlie
had
been
standing
intently
regarding
the
conversation
that
concerned
him
so
deeply
his
face
was
pale
and
his
lips
quivering
with
agitation
i
like
to
keep
you
my
boy
but
you
see
how
i
situated
i
must
either
give
up
you
or
my
business
the
latter
i
can
not
afford
to
do
with
a
great
effort
charlie
repressed
his
tears
and
bidding
them
good
morning
in
a
choking
voice
hastened
from
the
room
it
an
infernal
shame
said
blatchford
indignantly
and
i
shall
think
meanly
of
myself
for
ever
for
submitting
to
it
but
i
ca
help
myself
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
charlie
walked
downstairs
with
lingering
steps
and
took
the
direction
of
home
all
because
i
coloured
said
he
bitterly
to
himself
all
because
i
coloured
what
will
mother
and
esther
say
how
it
will
distress
them
they
so
built
upon
it
i
wish
said
he
sadly
that
i
was
dead
no
longer
able
to
repress
the
tears
that
were
welling
up
he
walked
towards
the
window
of
a
where
he
pretended
to
be
deeply
interested
in
some
pictures
whilst
he
stealthily
wiped
his
eyes
every
time
he
turned
to
leave
the
window
there
came
a
fresh
flood
of
tears
and
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
give
way
entirely
and
sobbed
as
if
his
heart
would
break
he
was
thus
standing
when
he
felt
a
hand
laid
familiarly
on
his
shoulder
and
on
turning
round
he
beheld
the
gentleman
he
had
left
in
blatchford
office
come
my
little
man
said
he
do
take
it
so
much
to
heart
cheer
up
you
may
find
some
other
person
willing
to
employ
you
come
walk
on
with
me
where
do
you
live
charlie
dried
his
eyes
and
gave
him
his
address
as
they
walked
on
up
the
street
together
burrell
talked
encouragingly
and
quite
succeeded
in
soothing
him
ere
they
separated
i
shall
keep
a
look
out
for
you
said
he
kindly
and
if
i
hear
of
anything
likely
to
suit
you
i
shall
let
you
know
charlie
thanked
him
and
sauntered
slowly
home
when
he
arrived
and
they
saw
his
agitated
looks
and
his
eyes
swollen
from
the
effect
of
recent
tears
there
was
a
general
inquiry
of
what
has
happened
why
are
you
home
so
early
are
you
sick
charlie
hereupon
related
all
that
had
transpired
at
the
office
his
great
disappointment
and
the
occasion
of
it
to
the
intense
indignation
and
grief
of
his
mother
and
sisters
i
wish
there
were
no
white
folks
said
caddy
wrathfully
they
are
all
i
believe
a
complete
set
of
villains
and
everything
else
that
is
bad
do
be
so
sweeping
in
your
remarks
pray
do
caddy
interposed
esther
you
have
just
heard
what
charlie
said
of
blatchford
his
heart
is
kindly
disposed
at
any
rate
you
see
he
is
trammelled
by
others
oh
well
i
do
like
any
of
them
i
hate
them
all
she
continued
bitterly
driving
her
needle
at
the
same
time
into
the
cloth
she
was
sewing
as
if
it
was
a
white
person
she
had
in
her
lap
and
she
was
sticking
pins
in
him
do
cry
charlie
she
added
the
old
white
wretches
they
should
get
a
tear
out
of
me
for
fifty
trades
but
charlie
could
not
be
comforted
he
buried
his
head
in
his
mother
lap
and
wept
over
his
disappointment
until
he
made
himself
sick
that
day
after
burrell
had
finished
his
dinner
he
remarked
to
his
wife
i
saw
something
this
morning
my
dear
that
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
i
have
been
able
to
get
it
out
of
my
head
for
any
length
of
time
since
it
touched
me
deeply
i
assure
you
why
what
could
it
have
been
pray
tell
me
what
it
was
thereupon
he
gave
his
wife
a
graphic
account
of
the
events
that
had
transpired
at
blatchford
in
the
morning
and
in
conclusion
said
now
you
know
my
dear
that
no
one
would
call
an
and
i
suppose
i
have
some
little
prejudice
as
well
as
others
against
coloured
people
but
i
had
no
idea
that
sensible
men
would
have
carried
it
to
that
extent
to
set
themselves
up
as
they
did
in
opposition
to
a
little
boy
anxious
to
earn
his
bread
by
learning
a
useful
trade
burrell
was
a
young
woman
of
about
with
a
round
face
and
plump
figure
she
had
a
heart
overflowing
with
kindness
and
was
naturally
much
affected
by
what
he
related
i
declare
it
perfectly
outrageous
exclaimed
she
indignantly
and
i
wonder
at
blatchford
for
submitting
to
it
i
would
allow
myself
to
be
dictated
to
in
that
manner
and
he
such
an
abolitionist
too
had
i
been
him
i
should
have
stuck
to
my
principles
at
any
risk
poor
little
fellow
i
so
wonder
at
blatchford
i
really
do
think
he
has
acted
manly
not
so
fast
my
little
woman
if
you
please
that
is
the
way
with
almost
all
of
you
you
let
your
hearts
run
away
with
your
heads
you
are
unjust
to
blatchford
he
could
not
help
himself
he
was
completely
in
their
power
it
is
almost
impossible
at
present
to
procure
workmen
in
our
business
and
he
is
under
contract
to
finish
a
large
amount
of
work
within
a
specified
time
and
if
he
should
fail
to
fulfil
his
agreement
it
would
subject
him
to
immense
loss
in
fact
it
would
entirely
ruin
him
you
are
aware
my
dear
that
i
am
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
state
of
his
affairs
he
is
greatly
in
debt
from
unfortunate
speculations
and
a
false
step
just
now
would
overset
him
completely
he
could
not
have
done
otherwise
than
he
has
and
do
justice
to
himself
and
his
family
i
felt
that
he
could
not
and
in
fact
advised
him
to
act
as
he
did
now
george
burrell
you
did
said
she
reproachfully
yes
i
did
my
dear
because
i
thought
of
his
family
i
really
believe
though
had
i
encouraged
him
he
would
have
made
the
sacrifice
and
what
became
of
the
boy
oh
poor
lad
he
seemed
very
much
cut
down
by
it
i
was
quite
touched
by
his
grief
when
i
came
out
i
found
him
standing
by
a
shop
window
crying
bitterly
i
tried
to
pacify
him
and
told
him
i
would
endeavour
to
obtain
a
situation
for
him
somewhere
and
i
shall
has
he
parents
asked
burrell
yes
and
by
the
way
do
you
remember
whilst
the
mob
was
raging
last
summer
we
read
an
account
of
a
man
running
to
the
roof
of
a
house
to
escape
from
the
rioters
you
remember
they
chopped
his
hands
off
and
threw
him
over
oh
yes
dear
i
recollect
do
do
mention
it
said
she
with
a
shudder
of
horror
i
remember
it
perfectly
well
this
little
fellow
is
his
son
continued
burrell
indeed
and
what
has
become
of
his
father
did
he
die
no
he
partially
recovered
but
is
helpless
and
almost
an
idiot
i
never
saw
a
child
apparently
so
anxious
to
get
work
he
talked
more
like
a
man
with
a
family
dependent
upon
him
for
support
than
a
youth
i
tell
you
what
i
became
quite
interested
in
him
he
was
very
communicative
and
told
me
all
their
circumstances
their
house
was
destroyed
by
the
mob
and
they
are
at
present
residing
with
a
friend
just
then
the
cry
of
a
child
was
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
and
burrell
rushed
precipitately
away
and
soon
returned
with
a
fat
boy
in
her
arms
which
after
kissing
she
placed
in
her
husband
lap
he
was
their
and
only
child
and
as
a
matter
of
course
a
great
pet
and
regarded
by
them
as
a
most
wonderful
boy
in
consequence
papa
sat
quite
still
and
permitted
him
to
pull
the
studs
out
of
his
shirt
untie
his
cravat
rumple
his
hair
and
take
all
those
little
liberties
to
which
babies
are
notoriously
addicted
burrell
sat
down
on
a
stool
at
her
husband
feet
and
gazed
at
him
and
the
child
in
silence
for
some
time
what
the
matter
jane
what
has
made
you
so
grave
i
was
trying
to
imagine
burrell
how
i
should
feel
if
you
i
and
baby
were
coloured
i
was
trying
to
place
myself
in
such
a
situation
now
we
know
that
our
boy
if
he
is
honest
and
upright
is
blest
with
great
talent
or
genius
may
aspire
to
any
station
in
society
that
he
wishes
to
obtain
how
different
it
would
be
if
he
were
coloured
there
would
be
nothing
bright
in
the
prospective
for
him
we
could
hardly
promise
him
a
living
at
any
respectable
calling
i
think
george
we
treat
coloured
people
with
great
injustice
do
you
burrell
hemmed
and
ha
at
this
direct
query
and
answered
well
we
do
act
exactly
right
toward
them
i
must
confess
burrell
rose
and
took
the
vacant
knee
of
her
husband
and
toying
with
the
baby
said
now
george
burrell
i
want
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
why
ca
take
this
boy
i
take
him
why
my
dear
i
do
want
an
apprentice
yes
but
you
must
a
want
you
said
he
was
a
bright
boy
and
sketched
well
why
i
should
think
that
he
just
what
you
ought
to
have
there
is
no
one
at
your
office
that
would
oppose
it
cummings
and
dalton
were
with
your
father
before
you
they
would
never
object
to
anything
reasonable
that
you
proposed
come
dear
do
now
make
the
trial
you
burrell
was
a
yielding
sort
of
an
individual
and
what
was
more
his
wife
was
fully
aware
of
it
and
like
a
young
witch
as
she
was
she
put
on
her
sweetest
looks
and
begged
so
imploringly
that
he
was
almost
conquered
but
when
she
took
up
the
baby
and
made
him
put
his
chubby
arms
round
his
father
neck
and
say
pese
he
was
completely
vanquished
and
surrendered
at
discretion
i
see
what
can
be
done
said
he
at
last
and
will
you
do
it
afterwards
she
asked
archly
yes
i
will
dear
i
assure
you
he
rejoined
then
i
know
it
will
be
done
said
she
confidently
and
none
of
us
will
be
the
worse
off
for
it
i
am
sure
after
leaving
home
burrell
went
immediately
to
the
office
of
blatchford
and
after
having
procured
charlie
portfolio
he
started
in
the
direction
of
his
own
establishment
he
did
not
by
any
means
carry
on
so
extensive
a
business
as
blatchford
and
employed
only
two
elderly
men
as
journeymen
after
he
had
sat
down
to
work
one
of
them
remarked
tucker
has
been
here
and
wants
some
rough
cuts
executed
for
a
new
book
i
told
him
i
did
not
think
you
would
engage
to
do
them
that
you
had
given
up
that
description
of
work
i
think
we
lose
a
great
deal
cummings
by
being
obliged
to
give
up
those
jobs
rejoined
burrell
why
do
you
take
an
apprentice
then
he
suggested
it
just
the
kind
of
work
for
them
to
learn
upon
well
i
been
thinking
of
that
replied
he
rising
and
producing
the
drawings
from
charlie
portfolio
look
here
said
he
what
do
you
think
of
these
as
the
work
of
a
lad
of
twelve
or
fourteen
who
has
never
had
more
than
half
a
dozen
lessons
i
should
say
they
were
remarkably
well
done
responded
cummings
should
you
say
so
dalton
the
party
addressed
took
the
sketches
and
examined
them
thoroughly
and
gave
an
approving
opinion
of
their
merits
well
said
burrell
the
boy
that
executed
those
is
in
want
of
a
situation
and
i
should
like
to
take
him
but
i
thought
i
would
consult
you
both
about
it
first
i
met
with
him
under
very
singular
circumstances
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
forthwith
he
repeated
to
them
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
dwelling
upon
the
most
affecting
parts
and
concluding
by
putting
the
question
to
them
direct
as
to
whether
they
had
any
objections
to
his
taking
him
why
no
none
in
the
world
readily
answered
cummings
laws
me
colour
is
nothing
after
all
and
black
fingers
can
handle
a
graver
as
well
as
white
ones
i
expect
i
thought
it
best
to
ask
you
to
avoid
any
after
difficulty
you
have
both
been
in
the
establishment
so
long
that
i
felt
that
you
ought
to
be
consulted
you
need
have
taken
that
trouble
said
dalton
you
might
have
known
that
anything
done
by
your
father
son
would
be
satisfactory
to
us
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
coloured
people
and
have
anything
against
them
and
as
long
as
you
are
contented
i
am
well
we
all
have
our
little
prejudices
against
various
things
and
as
i
did
not
know
how
you
both
would
feel
i
thought
i
would
take
any
decided
steps
without
consulting
you
but
now
i
shall
consider
it
settled
and
will
let
the
lad
know
that
i
will
take
him
in
the
evening
he
hastened
home
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
and
delighted
his
wife
by
saying
i
have
succeeded
to
a
charm
my
dear
there
was
the
very
slightest
objection
i
going
to
take
the
boy
if
he
wishes
to
come
oh
i
delighted
cried
she
clapping
her
hands
cry
hurrah
for
papa
said
she
to
the
baby
cry
hurrah
for
papa
the
scion
of
the
house
of
burrell
gave
vent
to
some
scarcely
intelligible
sounds
that
resembled
which
his
mother
averred
was
astonishingly
plain
and
deserving
of
a
kiss
and
snatching
him
up
she
gave
him
two
or
three
hearty
ones
and
then
planted
him
in
his
father
lap
again
my
dear
said
her
husband
i
thought
as
you
proposed
my
taking
this
youth
you
might
like
to
have
the
pleasure
of
acquainting
him
with
his
good
fortune
after
tea
if
you
are
disposed
we
will
go
down
there
the
walk
will
do
you
good
oh
george
burrell
said
she
her
face
radiant
with
pleasure
you
are
certainly
trying
to
outdo
yourself
i
have
been
languishing
all
day
for
a
walk
what
a
charming
husband
you
are
i
really
ought
to
do
something
for
you
ah
i
know
what
i
indulge
you
you
may
smoke
all
the
way
there
and
back
i
even
go
so
far
as
to
light
the
cigars
for
you
myself
that
is
a
boon
rejoined
her
husband
with
a
smile
really
rewarded
i
declare
tea
over
the
baby
kissed
and
put
to
bed
burrell
tied
on
the
most
bewitching
of
bonnets
and
donning
her
new
cloak
declared
herself
ready
for
the
walk
and
off
they
started
burrell
puffed
away
luxuriously
as
they
walked
along
stopping
now
and
then
at
her
command
to
look
into
such
as
contained
articles
adapted
to
the
use
of
infants
from
rings
and
ivory
rattles
to
baby
coats
and
shoes
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
door
of
walters
and
on
looking
up
at
the
house
he
exclaimed
this
is
but
it
ca
be
the
place
surely
coloured
people
do
live
in
as
fine
an
establishment
as
this
then
running
up
the
steps
he
examined
the
plate
upon
the
door
the
name
corresponds
with
the
address
given
me
said
he
i
ring
is
there
a
lad
living
here
by
the
name
of
charles
ellis
he
asked
of
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
yes
sir
was
the
reply
will
you
walk
in
when
they
were
ushered
into
the
burrell
said
be
kind
enough
to
say
that
a
gentleman
wishes
to
see
him
the
girl
departed
closing
the
door
behind
her
leaving
them
staring
about
the
room
how
elegantly
it
is
furnished
said
she
i
had
an
idea
that
there
were
any
coloured
people
living
in
such
style
some
of
them
are
very
rich
remarked
her
husband
but
you
said
this
boy
was
poor
so
he
is
i
understand
they
are
staying
with
the
owner
of
this
house
whilst
they
were
thus
conversing
the
door
opened
and
esther
entered
i
am
sorry
said
she
that
my
brother
has
retired
he
has
a
very
severe
and
was
unable
to
remain
up
longer
his
mother
is
out
i
am
his
sister
and
shall
be
most
happy
to
receive
any
communication
for
him
i
regret
to
hear
of
his
indisposition
replied
burrell
i
hope
it
is
not
consequent
upon
his
disappointment
this
morning
i
fear
it
is
poor
fellow
he
took
it
very
much
to
heart
it
was
a
disappointment
to
us
all
we
were
congratulating
ourselves
on
having
secured
him
an
eligible
situation
i
assure
you
the
disappointment
is
not
all
on
one
side
he
is
a
very
promising
boy
and
the
loss
of
his
prospective
services
annoying
nothing
but
stern
necessity
caused
the
result
oh
we
entirely
acquit
you
blatchford
of
all
blame
in
the
matter
we
are
confident
that
what
happened
was
not
occasioned
by
any
indisposition
on
your
part
to
fulfil
your
agreement
my
dear
interrupted
burrell
she
thinks
you
are
mr
blatchford
and
are
you
not
asked
esther
with
some
surprise
oh
no
i
an
intimate
friend
of
his
and
was
present
this
morning
when
the
affair
happened
oh
indeed
responded
esther
yes
and
he
came
home
and
related
it
all
to
me
the
whole
affair
interrupted
burrell
i
was
dreadfully
provoked
i
assure
you
i
sympathized
with
him
very
much
i
became
deeply
interested
in
the
whole
affair
i
was
looking
at
my
little
boy
for
i
have
a
little
boy
said
she
with
matronly
dignity
and
i
thought
suppose
it
was
my
little
boy
being
treated
so
how
should
i
like
it
so
bringing
the
matter
home
to
myself
in
that
way
made
me
feel
all
the
more
strongly
about
it
and
i
just
told
george
burrell
he
must
take
him
as
he
is
an
engraver
and
i
and
the
baby
gave
him
no
rest
until
he
consented
to
do
so
he
will
take
him
on
the
same
terms
offered
by
blatchford
and
then
we
came
down
to
tell
you
and
and
said
she
quite
out
of
breath
that
is
all
about
it
esther
took
the
little
woman
plump
hand
in
both
her
own
and
for
a
moment
seemed
incapable
of
even
thanking
her
at
last
she
said
in
a
husky
voice
you
ca
think
what
a
relief
this
is
to
us
my
brother
has
taken
his
disappointment
so
much
to
heart
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
thank
you
god
will
reward
you
for
your
sympathy
and
kindness
you
must
excuse
me
she
continued
as
her
voice
faltered
we
have
latterly
been
so
unaccustomed
to
receive
such
sympathy
and
kindness
from
persons
of
your
complexion
that
this
has
quite
overcome
me
oh
now
do
i
sure
it
no
more
than
our
duty
and
i
as
much
pleased
as
you
can
possibly
be
it
has
given
me
heartfelt
gratification
i
assure
you
esther
repeated
her
thanks
and
followed
them
to
the
door
where
she
shook
hands
with
burrell
who
gave
her
a
pressing
invitation
to
come
and
see
her
baby
how
easy
it
is
george
burrell
said
the
happy
little
woman
to
make
the
hearts
of
others
as
light
as
our
feels
like
a
feather
she
added
as
she
skipped
along
clinging
to
his
arm
what
a
nice
girl
his
sister
is
is
her
brother
as
handsome
as
she
not
quite
he
answered
still
he
is
very
i
bring
him
home
with
me
at
dinner
and
then
you
can
see
him
chatting
merrily
they
soon
arrived
at
home
burrell
ran
straightway
upstairs
to
look
at
that
blessed
baby
she
found
him
sleeping
soundly
and
looking
as
comfortable
and
happy
as
it
is
possible
for
a
sleeping
baby
to
look
so
she
bestowed
upon
him
a
perfect
avalanche
of
kisses
and
retired
to
her
own
peaceful
pillow
and
now
having
thus
satisfactorily
arranged
for
our
young
friend
charlie
we
will
leave
him
for
a
few
years
engaged
in
his
new
pursuits
chapter
xxx
many
years
after
old
father
time
is
a
stealthy
worker
in
youth
we
are
scarcely
able
to
appreciate
his
efforts
and
oftentimes
think
him
an
exceedingly
slow
and
limping
old
fellow
when
we
ripen
into
maturity
and
are
fighting
our
own
way
through
the
battle
of
life
we
deem
him
swift
enough
of
foot
and
sometimes
rather
hurried
but
when
old
age
comes
on
and
death
and
the
grave
are
foretold
by
trembling
limbs
and
snowy
locks
we
wonder
that
our
course
has
been
so
swiftly
run
and
chide
old
time
for
a
somewhat
hasty
and
precipitate
individual
the
reader
must
imagine
that
many
years
have
passed
away
since
the
events
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapters
transpired
and
permit
us
to
the
characters
formerly
presented
without
any
attempt
to
describe
how
that
long
period
has
been
occupied
first
of
all
let
us
resume
our
acquaintance
with
stevens
to
effect
this
we
must
pay
that
gentleman
a
visit
at
his
luxurious
mansion
in
fifth
avenue
the
most
fashionable
street
of
new
york
the
place
where
the
upper
ten
thousand
of
that
vast
bustling
city
most
do
congregate
as
he
is
an
old
acquaintance
we
wo
say
friend
we
will
disregard
ceremony
and
walk
boldly
into
the
library
where
that
gentleman
is
sitting
he
is
changed
yes
sadly
changed
time
has
been
hard
at
work
with
him
and
dissatisfied
with
what
his
unaided
agency
could
produce
has
called
in
conscience
to
his
aid
and
their
united
efforts
have
left
their
marks
upon
him
he
looks
old
aye
very
old
the
bald
spot
on
his
head
has
extended
its
limits
until
there
is
only
a
fringe
of
thin
white
hair
above
the
ears
there
are
deep
wrinkles
upon
his
forehead
and
the
eyes
half
obscured
by
the
bushy
grey
eyebrows
are
bloodshot
and
sunken
the
jaws
hollow
and
spectral
and
his
lower
lip
drooping
and
flaccid
he
lifts
his
hand
to
pour
out
another
glass
of
liquor
from
the
decanter
at
his
side
when
his
daughter
lays
her
hand
upon
it
and
looks
appealingly
in
his
face
she
has
grown
to
be
a
tall
elegant
woman
slightly
thin
and
with
a
careworn
and
fatigued
expression
of
countenance
there
is
however
the
same
sweetness
in
her
clear
blue
eyes
and
as
she
moves
her
head
her
fair
flaxen
curls
float
about
her
face
as
dreamily
and
deliciously
as
ever
they
did
of
yore
she
is
still
in
black
wearing
mourning
for
her
mother
who
not
many
months
before
had
been
laid
in
a
quiet
nook
on
the
estate
at
savanah
pray
papa
do
drink
any
more
said
she
persuasively
it
makes
you
nervous
and
will
bring
on
one
of
those
frightful
attacks
again
let
me
alone
he
remonstrated
harshly
let
me
alone
and
take
your
hand
off
the
glass
the
doctor
has
forbidden
laudanum
so
i
will
have
brandy
instead
take
off
your
hand
and
let
me
drink
i
say
lizzie
still
kept
her
hand
upon
the
decanter
and
continued
gently
no
no
dear
pa
you
promised
me
you
would
only
drink
two
glasses
and
you
have
already
taken
three
it
is
exceedingly
injurious
the
doctor
insisted
upon
it
that
you
should
decrease
the
quantity
and
you
are
adding
to
it
instead
devil
take
the
doctor
exclaimed
he
roughly
endeavouring
to
disengage
her
hold
give
me
the
liquor
i
say
his
daughter
did
not
appear
the
least
alarmed
at
this
violence
of
manner
nor
suffer
her
grasp
upon
the
neck
of
the
decanter
to
be
relaxed
but
all
the
while
spoke
soothing
words
to
the
angry
old
man
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
relinquish
his
intention
of
drinking
any
more
you
do
respect
your
old
father
he
cried
in
a
whining
tone
you
take
advantage
of
my
helplessness
all
of
you
you
me
and
deny
me
the
very
comforts
of
life
i
tell
i
tell
the
doctor
he
continued
as
his
voice
subsided
into
an
almost
inaudible
tone
and
he
sank
back
into
the
chair
in
a
state
of
removing
the
liquor
from
his
reach
his
daughter
rang
the
bell
and
then
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
room
who
procured
that
liquor
for
my
father
she
asked
of
the
servant
who
entered
i
did
miss
answered
the
man
hesitatingly
let
this
be
the
last
time
you
do
such
a
thing
she
rejoined
eyeing
him
sternly
unless
you
wish
to
be
discharged
i
thought
you
all
fully
understood
that
on
no
consideration
was
my
father
to
have
liquor
unless
by
the
physician
or
my
order
it
aggravates
his
disease
and
neutralizes
all
the
doctor
efforts
and
unless
you
wish
to
be
immediately
discharged
never
repeat
the
same
offence
now
procure
some
assistance
it
is
time
my
father
was
prepared
for
bed
the
man
bowed
and
left
the
apartment
but
soon
returned
saying
there
was
a
person
in
the
hall
who
had
forced
his
way
into
the
house
and
who
positively
refused
to
stir
until
he
saw
stevens
he
has
been
here
two
or
three
times
added
the
man
and
he
is
very
rough
and
impudent
this
is
most
singular
conduct
exclaimed
miss
stevens
did
he
give
his
name
yes
miss
he
calls
himself
mccloskey
at
the
utterance
of
this
name
stevens
raised
his
head
and
stared
at
the
speaker
with
a
look
of
stupid
fright
and
inquired
who
here
what
name
is
that
speak
louder
what
name
mccloskey
answered
the
man
in
a
louder
tone
what
he
cried
stevens
with
a
terrified
look
where
where
is
he
he
continued
endeavouring
to
rise
where
is
he
stop
pa
interposed
his
daughter
alarmed
at
his
appearance
and
manner
do
stop
let
me
go
no
no
said
the
old
man
wildly
seizing
her
by
the
dress
to
detain
her
must
not
go
that
would
never
do
he
might
tell
her
he
muttered
to
himself
no
no
i
go
and
thus
speaking
he
made
another
ineffectual
attempt
to
reach
the
door
dear
father
do
let
me
go
she
repeated
imploringly
you
are
incapable
of
seeing
any
one
let
me
inquire
what
he
wants
she
added
endeavouring
to
loose
his
hold
upon
her
dress
no
you
shall
not
he
replied
clutching
her
dress
still
tighter
and
endeavouring
to
draw
her
towards
him
oh
father
she
asked
distractedly
what
can
this
mean
here
said
she
addressing
the
servant
who
stood
gazing
in
silent
wonder
on
this
singular
scene
help
my
father
into
his
chair
again
and
then
tell
this
strange
man
to
wait
awhile
the
exhausted
man
having
been
placed
in
his
chair
motioned
to
his
daughter
to
close
the
door
behind
the
servant
who
had
just
retired
he
wants
money
said
he
in
a
whisper
he
wants
money
he
make
beggars
of
us
all
and
yet
i
have
to
give
him
some
quick
give
me
my
let
me
give
him
something
before
he
has
a
chance
to
talk
to
any
one
quick
quick
the
distracted
girl
wrung
her
hands
with
grief
at
what
she
imagined
was
a
return
of
her
father
malady
and
exclaimed
oh
if
george
only
would
remain
at
home
it
is
too
much
for
me
to
have
the
care
of
father
whilst
he
is
in
such
a
state
then
pretending
to
be
in
search
of
the
she
turned
over
the
pamphlets
and
papers
upon
his
desk
that
she
might
gain
time
and
think
how
it
was
best
to
proceed
whilst
she
was
thus
hesitating
the
door
of
the
room
was
suddenly
opened
and
a
shabbily
dressed
man
bearing
a
strong
odour
of
rum
about
him
forced
his
way
into
the
apartment
saying
i
will
see
him
d
n
it
i
care
haporth
how
sick
he
is
let
me
go
or
by
the
powers
i
murther
some
of
yes
the
old
man
face
was
almost
blanched
with
terror
when
he
heard
the
voice
and
saw
the
abrupt
entry
of
the
intruder
he
sprang
from
the
chair
with
a
great
effort
and
then
unable
to
sustain
himself
sunk
fainting
on
the
floor
oh
you
have
killed
my
father
you
have
killed
my
father
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
that
you
dare
thrust
yourself
upon
him
in
this
manner
said
she
stooping
to
assist
in
raising
him
can
not
you
see
he
is
entirely
unfit
for
any
business
stevens
was
replaced
in
his
chair
and
water
thrown
in
his
face
to
facilitate
his
recovery
meanwhile
mccloskey
had
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
which
he
stood
sipping
as
coolly
as
if
everything
in
the
apartment
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
perfect
composure
the
singular
terror
of
her
father
and
the
boldness
and
assurance
of
the
intruder
were
to
miss
stevens
something
inexplicable
she
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
as
though
seeking
an
explanation
and
on
observing
symptoms
of
a
return
to
consciousness
on
the
part
of
her
parent
she
turned
to
mccloskey
and
said
appealingly
you
see
how
your
presence
has
agitated
my
father
pray
let
me
conjure
you
go
be
your
errand
what
it
may
i
promise
you
it
shall
have
the
earliest
attention
or
said
she
tell
me
what
it
is
perhaps
i
can
see
to
it
i
attend
a
great
deal
to
father
business
pray
tell
me
no
no
exclaimed
the
old
man
who
had
caught
the
last
few
words
of
his
daughter
no
no
not
a
syllable
here
i
well
i
well
enough
attend
to
you
there
there
that
will
do
he
continued
addressing
the
servant
leave
the
room
and
you
he
added
turning
to
his
daughter
do
you
go
too
i
am
much
better
now
and
can
talk
to
him
go
go
he
cried
impatiently
as
he
saw
evidences
of
a
disposition
to
linger
on
her
part
if
i
want
you
i
ring
go
this
person
wo
stay
long
not
if
i
get
what
i
came
for
miss
said
mccloskey
insolently
otherwise
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
i
may
stay
with
a
look
of
apprehension
lizzie
quitted
the
room
and
the
murderer
and
his
accomplice
were
alone
together
stevens
reached
across
the
table
drew
the
liquor
towards
him
and
recklessly
pouring
out
a
large
quantity
drained
the
glass
to
the
bottom
this
seemed
to
nerve
him
up
and
give
him
courage
for
he
turned
to
mccloskey
and
said
with
a
much
bolder
air
than
he
had
yet
shown
in
addressing
him
so
you
back
again
villain
are
you
i
thought
and
hoped
you
were
dead
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
horrid
spectre
i
been
divilish
near
it
squire
but
providence
has
preserved
me
ye
see
jist
to
be
a
comfort
to
ye
in
yer
old
age

shipwrecked

up
in
steamboats
and
i
had
favers
and
choleray
and

i
been
marcifully
presarved
to
ye
and
hope

a
good
dale
of
me
this
many
years
to
come
stevens
glared
at
him
fiercely
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
rejoined
you
promised
me
solemnly
five
years
ago
that
you
would
never
trouble
me
again
and
i
gave
you
money
enough
to
have
kept
you
in
comfort
ay
luxury
for
the
remainder
of
your
life
where
is
it
all
now
that
more
than
i
can
tell
you
squire
i
only
know
how
it
comes
i
trouble
myself
how
it
goes
that

are
anxious
on
that
score
you
better
hire
a
bookkeeper
for

he

honour
a
quarterly
account
and
then
it
wo
come
on
ye
so
sudden
when
it
all
out
another
time
insolent
muttered
stevens
mccloskey
gave
stevens
an
impudent
look
but
beyond
that
took
no
farther
notice
of
his
remark
but
proceeded
with
the
utmost
coolness
to
pour
out
another
glass
of
brandy
after
which
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
grate
and
placed
his
dirty
feet
upon
the
mantelpiece
in
close
proximity
to
an
alabaster
clock
you
make
yourself
very
much
at
home
said
stevens
indignantly
why
should
i
answered
his
tormentor
in
a
tone
of
the
most
perfect
good
humour
why
should
i
in
the
house
of
an
ould
acquaintance
and
particular
friend
just
the
place
to
feel
at
home
eh
stevens
then
folding
his
arms
and
tilting
back
his
chair
he
asked
coolly
you
a
cigar
have
ye
no
replied
stevens
surlily
and
if
i
had
you
should
not
have
it
your
insolence
is
unbearable
you
appear
continued
he
with
some
show
of
dignity
to
have
forgotten
who
i
am
and
who
you
are
ye
mistaken
there
squire
divil
a
bit

mccloskey

animal
that

that

his
hundreds
and
if

as
many
more
savin
his
friend
mccloskey
and
him
he
not
be
afther
chating
because
he
wo
be
able
to
get
a
chance
although
he
like
to
if
he
could
divil
a
doubt
of
that
it
false
i
never
tried
to
cheat
you
rejoined
stevens
courageously
for
the
liquor
was
beginning
to
have
a
very
inspiriting
effect
it
a
lie
i
paid
you
all
i
agreed
upon
and
more
besides
but
you
are
like
a
leech
never
satisfied

altogether
nearly
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
you
not
get
much
more
now
mind
i
tell
you
the
divil

rejoined
he
angrily
that
is
yet
to
be
seen
how
would
you
like
to
make
yer
appearance
at
court
some
fine
morning
on
the
charge
of
murther
eh
stevens
gave
a
perceptible
shudder
and
looked
round
whereupon
mccloskey
said
with
a
malevolent
grin
ye
see
i
stick
at
words
squire
i
call
things
by
their
names
so
i
perceive
answered
stevens
you
were
not
so
bold
once
ha
ha
laughed
mccloskey
i
know
as
well
as
you
then
was
under
the
thumb
that
was
before
we
were
sailing
in
the
one
boat
now
ye
see
squire
the
boot
is
on
the
other
leg
stevens
remained
quiet
for
a
few
moments
whilst
his
ragged
visitor
continued
to
leisurely
sip
his
brandy
and
contemplate
the
soles
of
his
boots
as
they
were
reflected
in
the
mirror
above
they
were
a
sorry
pair
of
boots
and
looked
as
if
there
would
soon
be
a
general
outbreak
of
his
toes
so
thin
and
dilapidated
did
the
soles
appear
look
at
thim
boots
and
me
suit
ginerally
and
see
if
your
conscience
wo
accuse
ye
of
ingratitude
to
the
man
who
made
yer
fortune
or
rather
lets
ye
keep
it
now
ye
have
it
is
it
a
shame
now
for
me
the
best
friend
you
got
in
the
world
to
be
tramping
the
streets
widdout
a
penny
in
his
pocket
and
ye
livin
in
clover
with
gold
pieces
as
plenty
as
blackberries
it
do
look
right
squire
and
must
go
on
any
longer
what
do
you
want
whatever
will
satisfy
you
asked
stevens
if
i
give
you
ever
so
much
now
what
guarantee

i
that
you
not
return
in
a
month
or
so
and
want
as
much
more
i
pledge
ye
me
honour
said
mccloskey
grandly
your
honour
rejoined
stevens
that
is
no
security
security
or
no
security
said
mccloskey
impatiently
you
have
to
give
me
the
money
it
not
a
bit
of
use
now
this
disputin
bekase
ye
see
i
bound
to
have
it
and
ye
are
wise
enough
to
know
ye
better
give
it
to
me
what
if
ye
have
give
me
thousands
upon
thousands
continued
he
his
former
expression
entirely
vanishing
it
nothing
more
than
you
ought
to
do
for
keeping
yer
secrets
for
ye
and
as
long
as
ye
have
money
ye
may
expect
to
share
it
with
me
so
make
me
out
a
good
heavy
cheque
and
say
no
more
about
it
what
do
you
call
a
heavy
cheque
asked
stevens
in
a
despairing
tone
five
or
six
thousand
coolly
answered
his
visitor
five
or
six
thousand
echoed
stevens
it
is
impossible
it
had
better
not
be
said
mccloskey
looking
angry
it
had
better
not
be
i
determined
not
to
be
leading
a
beggar
life
and
you
to
be
a
rolling
in
wealth
i
ca
give
it
and
wo
give
it
if
it
must
come
to
that
answered
stevens
desperately
it
is
you
that
have
the
fortune
i
am
only
your
banker
at
this
rate
i
ca
give
it
to
you
i
have
got
that
much
money
you
must
find
it
then
and
pretty
quick
at
that
said
mccloskey
i
not
to
be
fooled
with
i
came
here
for
money
and
i
must
and
will
have
it
i
am
willing
to
do
what
is
reasonable
rejoined
stevens
in
a
more
subdued
tone
you
talk
of
thousands
as
most
men
do
of
hundreds
i
really
have
got
it
oh
bother
such
stuff
as
that
interrupted
mccloskey
incredulously
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
asked
them
that
know
and
every
one
says
you
made
a
mint
of
money
by
speculation
that
since
ye
sold
out
in
the
south
and
came
here
to
live
there
no
end
to
the
money
ye
made
so
you
see
it
do
do
to
be
making
a
poor
mouth
to
me
i
come
here
for
a
check
for
five
thousand
dollars
and
sha
go
away
without
it
concluded
he
in
a
loud
and
threatening
tone
during
this
conversation
lizzie
stevens
had
been
standing
at
the
door
momentarily
expecting
a
recall
to
the
apartment
she
heard
the
low
rumble
of
their
voices
but
could
not
distinguish
words
at
length
hearing
mccloskey
raised
to
a
higher
key
she
could
no
longer
restrain
her
impatience
and
gently
opening
the
door
looked
into
the
room
both
their
faces
were
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
so
that
neither
noticed
the
gentle
intrusion
of
lizzie
who
fearing
to
leave
her
father
longer
alone
ventured
into
the
apartment
you
need
not
stand
looking
at
me
in
that
threatening
manner
you
may
do
as
you
please
go
tell
what
you
like
but
remember
when
i
fall
so
do
you
i
have
not
forgotten
that
affair
in
philadelphia
from
which
i
saved
you
do
place
me
in
a
situation
that
will
compel
me
to
recur
to
it
to
your
disadvantage
ah
do
trouble
yerself
about
that
squire
i
do
that
is
entirely
off
my
mind
for
now
whitticar
is
dead
where
is
yer
witnesses
whitticar
dead
repeated
stevens
yes
and
what
more
he
buried
so
he
safe
enough
squire
and
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
you
be
glad
to
have
me
gone
too
i
would
to
god
you
had
been
before
i
put
myself
in
your
power
was
your
own
hastiness
when
it
came
to
the
pinch
i
was
equal
to
the
job
so
ye
could
wait
for
another
time
but
out
with
yer
pistol
and
does
it
yerself
the
wretched
man
shuddered
and
covered
his
face
as
mccloskey
coolly
recounted
his
murder
of
garie
every
word
of
which
was
too
true
to
be
denied
and
have
i
suffered
said
he
shaking
his
bald
head
mournfully
have
i
suffered
look
at
my
grey
hairs
and
frame
decrepit
before
i
old
sinking
into
the
tomb
with
a
weight
of
guilt
and
sin
upon
me
that
will
crush
me
down
to
the
lowest
depth
of
hell
think
you
he
continued
that
because
i
am
surrounded
with
all
that
money
can
buy
that
i
am
happy
or
ever
shall
be
with
this
secret
gnawing
at
my
heart
every
piece
of
gold
i
count
out
i
see
his
hands
outstretched
over
it
and
hear
him
whisper
he
gives
me
no
peace
night
or
day
he
is
always
by
me
i
have
no
rest
and
you
must
come
adding
to
my
torture
and
striving
to
tear
from
me
that
for
which
i
bartered
conscience
peace
soul
everything
that
would
make
life
desirable
if
there
is
mercy
in
you
leave
me
with
what
i
give
you
and
come
back
no
more
life
has
so
little
to
offer
that
rather
than
bear
this
continued
torment
and
apprehension
i
daily
suffer
i
will
cut
my
throat
and
then
game
is
over
lizzie
stevens
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
whilst
her
father
made
the
confession
that
was
wrung
from
him
by
the
agony
of
the
moment
well
well
said
mccloskey
somewhat
startled
and
alarmed
at
threat
of
well
i
come
down
a
thousand
make
it
four
that
i
do
answered
the
old
man
tremblingly
and
reaching
over
he
drew
towards
him
the
after
writing
the
order
for
the
sum
he
was
placing
it
in
the
hand
of
mccloskey
when
hearing
a
faint
moan
he
looked
towards
the
door
and
saw
his
daughter
fall
fainting
to
the
ground
chapter
xxxi
the
thorn
rankles
we
left
the
quiet
town
of
sudbury
and
sparkling
in
all
the
glory
of
a
frosty
moonlight
night
we
now
return
to
it
and
discover
it
decked
out
in
its
bravest
summer
garniture
a
short
distance
above
the
hill
upon
which
it
is
built
the
water
of
the
river
that
glides
along
its
base
may
be
seen
springing
over
the
low
dam
that
obstructs
its
passage
sparkling
glistening
dancing
in
the
sunlight
as
it
falls
splashing
on
the
stones
below
and
then
as
though
subdued
by
the
fall
and
crash
it
comes
murmuring
on
stopping
now
and
then
to
whirl
and
eddy
round
some
rock
or
protruding
stump
and
at
last
glides
gently
under
the
arch
of
the
bridge
seemingly
to
pause
beneath
its
shadow
and
ponder
upon
its
recent
tumble
from
the
heights
above
seated
here
and
there
upon
the
bridge
are
groups
of
boys
rod
in
hand
endeavouring
with
the
most
and
persuasive
of
baits
to
inveigle
finny
innocents
from
the
cool
depths
below
the
windows
of
the
mills
are
all
thrown
open
and
now
and
then
the
voices
of
some
operatives
singing
at
their
work
steal
forth
in
company
with
the
whir
and
hum
of
the
spindles
and
mingle
with
the
splash
of
the
waterfall
and
the
united
voices
of
nature
industry
and
man
harmonize
their
swelling
tones
or
go
floating
upward
on
the
soft
july
air
the
houses
upon
the
seem
to
be
endeavouring
to
extricate
themselves
from
bowers
of
trees
and
with
their
white
fronts
relieved
by
the
light
green
blinds
look
cool
and
inviting
in
the
distance
high
above
them
all
as
though
looking
down
in
pride
upon
the
rest
stands
the
academy
ennobled
in
the
course
of
years
by
the
addition
of
extensive
wings
and
a
row
of
stately
pillars
on
the
whole
the
town
looked
charmingly
peaceful
and
attractive
and
appeared
just
the
quiet
nook
that
a
weary
worker
in
cities
would
select
as
a
place
of
retirement
after
a
busy
round
of
toils
or
pleasure
there
were
little
knots
of
idlers
gathered
about
the
railroad
station
as
there
always
is
in
quiet
towns
not
that
they
expect
any
one
but
that
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
train
is
one
of
the
events
of
the
day
and
those
who
have
nothing
else
particular
to
accomplish
feel
constrained
to
be
on
hand
to
witness
it
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
look
down
the
line
and
wonder
why
the
cars
were
not
in
sight
amongst
those
seemingly
the
most
impatient
was
miss
ada
bell
who
looked
but
little
older
than
when
she
won
the
heart
of
the
orphan
clarence
years
before
by
that
kind
kiss
upon
his
childish
brow
it
was
hers
still
she
bound
it
to
her
by
long
years
of
affectionate
care
almost
equalling
in
its
sacrificing
tenderness
that
which
a
mother
would
have
bestowed
upon
her
only
child
clarence
her
adopted
son
had
written
to
her
that
he
was
wretched
and
ill
and
longed
to
come
to
her
his
almost
mother
for
sympathy
advice
and
comfort
so
she
with
yearning
heart
was
there
to
meet
him
at
last
the
faint
scream
of
the
was
heard
and
soon
the
lumbering
locomotive
came
puffing
and
snorting
on
its
iron
path
dashing
on
as
though
it
could
never
stop
and
making
the
surrounding
hills
echo
with
the
unearthly
scream
of
its
startling
whistle
and
arousing
to
desperation
every
dog
in
the
quiet
little
town
at
last
it
stopped
and
stood
giving
short
and
impatient
snorts
and
hisses
whilst
the
passengers
were
alighting
clarence
stepped
languidly
out
and
was
soon
in
the
embrace
of
miss
ada
my
dear
boy
how
thin
and
pale
you
look
she
exclaimed
come
get
into
the
carriage
never
mind
your
baggage
george
will
look
after
that
your
hands
are
hot
very
hot
you
must
be
feverish
yes
aunt
ada
for
so
he
had
insisted
on
his
calling
her
i
am
ill
sick
in
heart
mind
and
everything
cut
up
the
horses
said
he
with
slight
impatience
of
manner
let
us
get
home
quickly
when
i
get
in
the
old
parlour
and
let
you
bathe
my
head
as
you
used
to
i
am
sure
i
shall
feel
better
i
am
almost
exhausted
from
fatigue
and
heat
very
well
then
dear
do
talk
now
she
replied
not
in
the
least
noticing
his
impatience
of
manner
when
you
are
rested
and
have
had
your
tea
will
be
time
enough
they
were
soon
in
the
old
house
and
clarence
looked
round
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
on
the
room
where
he
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
good
aunt
ada
would
not
let
him
talk
but
compelled
him
to
remain
quiet
until
he
had
rested
himself
and
eaten
his
evening
meal
he
had
altered
considerably
in
the
lapse
of
years
there
was
but
little
left
to
remind
one
of
the
slight
boy
that
once
stood
a
little
stranger
in
the
same
room
in
days
gone
by
his
face
was
without
a
particle
of
red
to
relieve
its
uniform
paleness
his
eyes
large
dark
and
languishing
were
half
hidden
by
unusually
long
lashes
his
forehead
broad
and
surmounted
with
clustering
raven
hair
a
glossy
moustache
covered
his
lip
and
softened
down
its
fulness
on
the
whole
he
was
strikingly
handsome
and
none
would
pass
him
without
a
second
look
tea
over
miss
ada
insisted
that
he
should
lie
down
upon
the
sofa
again
whilst
she
sat
by
and
bathed
his
head
have
you
seen
your
sister
lately
she
asked
no
aunt
ada
he
answered
hesitatingly
whilst
a
look
of
annoyance
darkened
his
face
for
a
moment
i
have
not
been
to
visit
her
since
last
fall
almost
a
year
oh
clarence
how
can
you
remain
so
long
away
said
she
reproachfully
well
i
ca
go
there
with
any
comfort
or
pleasure
he
answered
apologetically
i
ca
go
there
each
year
as
i
visit
the
place
their
ways
seem
more
strange
and
irksome
to
me
whilst
enjoying
her
company
i
must
of
course
come
in
familiar
contact
with
those
by
whom
she
is
surrounded
sustaining
the
position
that
i
do
passing
as
i
am
for
a
white
man
i
am
obliged
to
be
very
circumspect
and
have
often
been
compelled
to
give
her
pain
by
avoiding
many
of
her
dearest
friends
when
i
have
encountered
them
in
public
places
because
of
their
complexion
i
feel
mean
and
cowardly
whilst
i
doing
it
but
it
is
necessary
i
ca
be
white
and
coloured
at
the
same
time
the
two
do
mingle
and
i
must
consequently
be
one
or
the
other
my
education
habits
and
ideas
all
unfit
me
for
associating
with
the
latter
and
i
live
in
constant
dread
that
something
may
occur
to
bring
me
out
with
the
former
i
do
avoid
coloured
people
because
i
esteem
them
my
inferiors
in
refinement
education
or
intelligence
but
because
they
are
subjected
to
degradations
that
i
shall
be
compelled
to
share
by
too
freely
associating
with
them
it
is
a
pity
continued
he
with
a
sigh
that
i
was
not
suffered
to
grow
up
with
them
then
i
should
have
learnt
to
bear
their
burthens
and
in
the
course
of
time
might
have
walked
over
my
path
of
life
bearing
the
load
almost
unconsciously
now
it
would
crush
me
i
know
it
was
a
great
mistake
to
place
me
in
my
present
false
position
concluded
he
bitterly
it
has
cursed
me
only
a
day
ago
i
had
a
letter
from
em
reproaching
me
for
my
coldness
yet
god
help
me
what
am
i
to
do
miss
ada
looked
at
him
sorrowfully
and
continued
smoothing
down
his
hair
and
inundating
his
temples
with
cologne
at
last
she
ventured
to
inquire
how
do
matters
progress
with
you
and
miss
bates
clary
you
have
lost
your
heart
there
too
true
he
replied
hurriedly
and
what
is
more
little
birdie
i
call
her
little
birdie
has
lost
hers
too
aunt
ada
we
are
engaged
with
her
parents
consent
she
asked
yes
with
her
parents
consent
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
coming
winter
then
they
know
of
course
they
know
you
are
coloured
observed
she
they
know
all
cried
he
starting
up
said
they
did
told
them
tell
me
that
i
say
who
has
to
tell
them
i
am
a
coloured
man
hush
clarence
hush
replied
she
attempting
to
soothe
him
i
do
not
know
that
any
one
has
informed
them
i
only
inferred
so
from
your
saying
you
were
engaged
i
thought
had
informed
them
yourself
do
you
remember
you
wrote
that
you
should
and
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
had
oh
yes
yes
so
i
did
i
fully
intended
to
but
found
myself
too
great
a
coward
dare
i
can
not
risk
losing
her
i
am
fearful
that
if
she
knew
it
she
would
throw
me
off
for
ever
perhaps
not
clarence
if
she
loves
you
as
she
should
and
even
if
she
did
would
it
not
be
better
that
she
should
know
it
now
than
have
it
discovered
afterwards
and
you
both
be
rendered
miserable
for
life
no
no
aunt
ada
i
can
not
tell
her
it
must
remain
a
secret
until
after
our
marriage
then
if
they
find
it
out
it
will
be
to
their
interest
to
smooth
the
matter
over
and
keep
quiet
about
it
clary
clary
that
is
honourable
i
know
it
but
how
can
i
help
it
once
or
twice
i
thought
of
telling
her
but
my
heart
always
failed
me
at
the
critical
moment
it
would
kill
me
to
lose
her
oh
i
love
her
aunt
ada
said
he
passionately
love
her
with
all
the
energy
and
strength
of
my
father
race
and
all
the
doating
tenderness
of
my
mother
i
could
have
told
her
long
ago
before
my
love
had
grown
to
its
present
towering
strength
but
craft
set
a
seal
upon
my
lips
and
bid
me
be
silent
until
her
heart
was
fully
mine
and
then
nothing
could
part
us
yet
now
even
when
sure
of
her
affections
the
dread
that
her
love
would
not
stand
the
test
compels
me
to
shrink
more
than
ever
from
the
disclosure
but
clarence
you
are
not
acting
generously
i
know
your
conscience
does
not
approve
your
actions
do
i
know
that
he
answered
almost
fiercely
yet
i
dare
not
tell
i
must
shut
this
secret
in
my
bosom
where
it
gnaws
gnaws
gnaws
until
it
has
almost
eaten
my
heart
away
oh
i
thought
of
that
time
and
again
it
has
kept
me
awake
night
after
night
it
haunts
me
at
all
hours
it
is
breaking
down
my
health
and
strength
wearing
my
very
life
out
of
me
no
escaped
ever
felt
more
than
i
do
or
lived
in
more
constant
fear
of
detection
and
yet
i
must
nourish
this
tormenting
secret
and
keep
it
growing
in
my
breast
until
it
has
crowded
out
every
honourable
and
manly
feeling
and
then
perhaps
after
all
my
sufferings
and
sacrifice
of
candour
and
truth
out
it
will
come
at
last
when
i
least
expect
or
think
of
it
aunt
ada
could
not
help
weeping
and
exclaimed
commiseratingly
my
poor
poor
boy
as
he
strode
up
and
down
the
room
the
whole
family
except
her
seem
to
have
the
deepest
contempt
for
coloured
people
they
are
constantly
making
them
a
subject
of
bitter
jests
they
appear
to
have
no
more
feeling
or
regard
for
them
than
if
they
were
brutes
and
i
continued
he
i
miserable
contemptible
knave
as
i
am
i
i
yes
i
join
them
in
their
heartless
jests
and
wonder
all
the
while
my
mother
does
not
rise
from
her
grave
and
me
as
i
speak
oh
clarence
clarence
my
dear
child
cried
the
terrified
aunt
ada
you
talk
deliriously
you
have
brooded
over
this
until
it
has
almost
made
you
crazy
come
here
sit
down
and
seizing
him
by
the
arm
she
drew
him
on
the
sofa
beside
her
and
began
to
bathe
his
hot
head
with
the
cologne
again
let
me
walk
aunt
ada
said
he
after
a
few
moments
let
me
walk
i
feel
better
whilst
i
am
moving
i
ca
bear
to
be
quiet
and
forthwith
he
commenced
striding
up
and
down
the
room
again
with
nervous
and
hurried
steps
after
a
few
moments
he
burst
out
again
it
seems
as
if
fresh
annoyances
and
complications
beset
me
every
day
em
writes
me
that
she
is
engaged
i
was
in
hopes
that
after
i
had
married
i
could
persuade
her
to
come
and
live
with
me
and
so
gradually
break
off
her
connection
with
coloured
people
but
that
hope
is
extinguished
now
she
is
engaged
to
a
coloured
man
aunt
ada
could
see
no
remedy
for
this
new
difficulty
and
could
only
say
indeed
i
thought
something
of
the
kind
would
occur
when
i
was
last
at
home
and
spoke
to
her
on
the
subject
but
she
evaded
giving
me
any
definite
answer
i
think
she
was
afraid
to
tell
me
she
has
written
asking
my
consent
and
will
you
give
it
asked
aunt
ada
it
will
matter
but
little
if
i
do
em
has
a
will
of
her
own
and
i
have
no
means
of
coercing
her
besides
i
have
no
reasonable
objection
to
urge
it
would
be
folly
in
me
to
oppose
it
simply
because
he
is
a
coloured
man
for
what
am
i
myself
the
only
difference
is
that
his
identity
with
coloured
people
is
no
secret
and
he
is
not
ashamed
of
it
whilst
i
conceal
my
origin
and
live
in
constant
dread
that
some
one
may
find
it
out
when
clarence
had
finished
he
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
looking
very
careworn
and
gloomy
miss
bell
remained
on
the
sofa
thoughtfully
regarding
him
at
last
she
rose
up
and
took
his
hand
in
hers
as
she
used
to
when
he
was
a
boy
and
walking
beside
him
said
the
more
i
reflect
upon
it
the
more
necessary
i
regard
it
that
you
should
tell
this
girl
and
her
parents
your
real
position
before
you
marry
her
throw
away
concealment
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
you
may
not
be
rejected
when
they
find
her
heart
is
so
deeply
interested
if
you
marry
her
with
this
secret
hanging
over
you
it
will
embitter
your
life
make
you
reserved
suspicious
and
consequently
and
destroy
all
your
domestic
happiness
let
me
persuade
you
tell
them
ere
it
be
too
late
suppose
it
reached
them
through
some
other
source
what
would
they
then
think
of
you
who
else
would
tell
them
who
else
knows
it
you
you
said
he
suspiciously
would
not
betray
me
i
thought
you
loved
me
aunt
ada
clarence
my
dear
boy
she
rejoined
apparently
hurt
by
his
hasty
and
accusing
tone
you
mistake
me
i
have
no
such
intention
if
they
are
never
to
learn
it
except
through
your
secret
is
perfectly
safe
yet
i
must
tell
you
that
i
feel
and
think
that
the
true
way
to
promote
her
happiness
and
your
own
is
for
you
to
disclose
to
them
your
real
position
and
throw
yourself
upon
their
generosity
for
the
result
clarence
pondered
for
a
long
time
over
miss
bell
advice
which
she
again
and
again
repeated
placing
it
each
time
before
him
in
a
stronger
light
until
at
last
she
extracted
from
him
a
promise
that
he
would
do
it
i
know
you
are
right
aunt
ada
said
he
i
am
convinced
of
that
it
is
a
question
of
courage
with
me
i
know
it
would
be
more
honourable
for
me
to
tell
her
now
i
try
to
do
it
i
will
make
an
effort
and
summon
up
the
courage
necessary
god
be
my
helper
that
a
dear
boy
she
exclaimed
kissing
him
affectionately
i
know
you
will
feel
happier
when
it
is
all
over
and
even
if
she
should
break
her
engagement
you
will
be
infinitely
better
off
than
if
it
was
fulfilled
and
your
secret
subsequently
discovered
come
now
she
concluded
i
am
going
to
exert
my
old
authority
and
send
you
to
bed
tomorrow
perhaps
you
may
see
this
in
a
more
hopeful
light
two
days
after
this
clarence
was
again
in
new
york
amid
the
heat
and
dust
of
that
crowded
bustling
city
soon
after
his
arrival
he
dressed
himself
and
started
for
the
mansion
of
bates
trembling
as
he
went
for
the
result
of
the
communication
he
was
about
to
make
once
on
the
way
he
paused
for
the
thought
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
write
to
them
then
reproaching
himself
for
his
weakness
and
timidity
he
started
on
again
with
renewed
determination
i
see
her
myself
he
soliloquized
i
tell
little
birdie
all
and
know
my
fate
from
her
own
lips
if
i
must
give
her
up
i
know
the
worst
from
her
when
clarence
was
admitted
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
be
announced
but
walked
tiptoe
upstairs
and
gently
opening
the
door
entered
the
room
standing
by
the
piano
turning
over
the
leaves
of
some
music
and
merrily
humming
an
air
was
a
young
girl
of
extremely
and
delicate
form
her
complexion
was
strikingly
fair
and
the
rich
curls
of
dark
auburn
that
fell
in
clusters
on
her
shoulders
made
it
still
more
dazzling
by
the
contrast
presented
her
eyes
were
grey
inclining
to
black
her
features
small
and
not
for
their
symmetry
yet
by
no
means
disproportionate
there
was
the
sweetest
of
dimples
on
her
small
round
chin
and
her
throat
white
and
clear
as
the
finest
marble
the
expression
of
her
face
was
extremely
childlike
she
seemed
more
like
a
schoolgirl
than
a
young
woman
of
eighteen
on
the
eve
of
marriage
there
was
something
deliriously
airy
and
fairylike
in
her
motions
and
as
she
slightly
moved
her
feet
in
time
to
the
music
she
was
humming
her
thin
blue
dress
floated
about
her
and
undulated
in
harmony
with
her
graceful
motions
after
gazing
at
her
for
a
few
moments
clarence
called
gently
little
birdie
she
gave
a
timid
joyous
little
cry
of
surprise
and
pleasure
and
fluttered
into
his
arms
oh
clary
love
how
you
startled
me
i
did
not
dream
there
was
any
one
in
the
room
it
was
so
naughty
in
you
said
she
childishly
as
he
pushed
back
the
curls
from
her
face
and
kissed
her
when
did
you
arrive
only
an
hour
ago
he
answered
and
you
came
here
at
once
ah
that
was
so
and
kind
she
rejoined
smiling
you
look
like
a
sylph
anne
said
he
as
she
danced
about
him
ah
he
continued
after
regarding
her
for
a
few
seconds
with
a
look
of
intense
admiration
you
want
to
rivet
my
chains
the
tighter
you
look
most
bewitching
why
are
you
so
much
dressed
jewels
sash
and
satin
slippers
he
continued
are
you
going
out
no
clary
she
answered
i
was
to
have
gone
to
the
theatre
but
just
at
the
last
moment
i
decided
not
to
a
singular
desire
to
stay
at
home
came
over
me
suddenly
i
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
i
should
lose
some
greater
enjoyment
if
i
went
so
i
remained
at
home
and
here
love
are
you
but
what
is
the
matter
you
look
sad
and
weary
i
am
a
little
fatigued
said
he
seating
himself
and
holding
her
hand
in
his
a
little
weary
but
that
will
soon
wear
off
and
as
for
the
sadness
concluded
he
with
a
forced
smile
that
depart
now
that
i
am
with
you
little
birdie
i
feel
relieved
that
you
have
returned
safe
and
well
said
she
looking
up
into
his
face
from
her
seat
beside
him
for
clary
love
i
had
such
a
frightful
dream
such
a
singular
dream
about
you
i
have
endeavoured
to
shake
it
out
of
my
foolish
little
head
but
it
wo
go
clary
i
get
rid
of
it
it
occurred
after
you
left
us
at
saratoga
oh
it
was
nothing
though
said
she
laughing
and
shaking
her
curls
nothing
and
now
you
are
safely
returned
i
shall
not
think
of
it
again
tell
me
what
you
have
seen
since
you
went
away
and
how
is
that
dear
aunt
ada
of
yours
you
talk
so
much
about
oh
she
is
quite
well
answered
he
but
tell
anne
tell
me
about
that
dream
what
was
it
birdie
come
tell
me
i
do
care
to
she
answered
with
a
slight
shudder
i
do
want
to
love
yes
yes
do
sweet
importuned
he
i
want
to
hear
it
then
if
i
must
said
she
i
will
i
dreamed
that
you
and
i
were
walking
on
a
road
together
and
was
such
a
beautiful
road
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
lovely
cottages
on
either
side
i
thought
you
held
my
hand
i
felt
it
just
as
plain
as
i
clasp
yours
now
presently
a
rough
ugly
man
overtook
us
and
bid
you
let
me
go
and
that
you
refused
and
held
me
all
the
tighter
then
he
gave
you
a
diabolical
look
and
touched
you
on
the
face
and
you
broke
out
in
loathsome
black
spots
and
screamed
in
such
agony
and
frightened
me
so
that
i
awoke
all
in
a
shiver
of
terror
and
did
not
get
over
it
all
the
next
day
clarence
clutched
her
hand
tighter
as
she
finished
so
tight
indeed
that
she
gave
a
little
scream
of
pain
and
looked
frightened
at
him
what
is
the
matter
she
inquired
your
hand
is
like
ice
and
you
are
paler
than
ever
you
have
let
that
trifling
dream
affect
you
so
it
is
nothing
i
am
superstitious
in
regard
to
dreams
said
clarence
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
go
he
asked
faintly
play
me
an
air
love
something
quick
and
lively
to
dispel
this
i
wish
you
had
not
told
me
but
you
begged
me
to
said
she
pouting
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
instrument
how
ominous
muttered
he
became
covered
with
black
spots
that
is
a
foreshadowing
how
can
i
tell
her
he
thought
it
seems
like
wilfully
destroying
my
own
happiness
and
he
sat
struggling
with
himself
to
obtain
the
necessary
courage
to
fulfil
the
purpose
of
his
visit
and
became
so
deeply
engrossed
with
his
own
reflections
as
to
scarcely
even
hear
the
sound
of
the
instrument
it
is
too
bad
she
cried
as
she
ceased
playing
here
i
have
performed
some
of
your
favourite
airs
and
that
too
without
eliciting
a
word
of
commendation
you
are
inexpressibly
dull
nothing
seems
to
enliven
you
what
is
the
matter
oh
rejoined
he
abstractedly
am
i
i
was
not
aware
of
it
yes
you
are
said
little
birdie
pettishly
nothing
seems
to
engage
your
attention
and
skipping
off
to
the
table
she
took
up
the
newspaper
and
exclaimed
let
me
read
you
something
very
curious
no
no
anne
dear
interrupted
he
sit
here
by
me
i
want
to
say
something
serious
to
you
something
of
moment
to
us
both
then
it
something
very
grave
and
dull
i
know
she
remarked
for
that
is
the
way
people
always
begin
now
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
serious
i
want
to
be
merry
you
serious
enough
and
if
you
begin
to
talk
seriously
you
be
perfectly
unbearable
so
you
must
hear
what
i
am
going
to
read
to
you
first
and
the
little
tyrant
put
her
finger
on
his
lip
and
looked
so
bewitching
that
he
could
not
refuse
her
and
the
important
secret
hung
on
his
lips
but
was
not
spoken
listen
said
she
spreading
out
the
paper
before
her
and
running
her
tiny
finger
down
the
column
ah
i
have
it
she
exclaimed
at
last
and
began
learn
from
unimpeachable
authority
that
the
hon
who
represents
a
district
of
our
city
in
the
state
legislature
was
yesterday
united
to
the
quateroon
daughter
of
the
late
gustave
almont
she
is
said
to
be
possessed
of
a
large
fortune
inherited
from
her
father
and
they
purpose
going
to
france
to
reside
a
sensible
determination
as
after
such
a
the
honourable
gentleman
can
no
longer
expect
to
retain
his
former
social
position
in
our
orleans
is
it
singular
she
remarked
that
a
man
in
his
position
should
make
such
a
choice
he
loved
her
no
doubt
suggested
clarence
and
she
was
almost
white
how
could
he
love
her
asked
she
wonderingly
love
a
coloured
woman
i
can
not
conceive
it
possible
said
she
with
a
look
of
disgust
there
is
something
strange
and
unnatural
about
it
no
no
he
rejoined
hurriedly
it
was
love
anne
pure
love
it
is
not
impossible
i
i
am
coloured
he
would
have
said
but
he
paused
and
looked
full
in
her
lovely
face
he
could
not
tell
her
the
words
slunk
back
into
his
coward
heart
unspoken
she
stared
at
him
in
wonder
and
perplexity
and
exclaimed
dear
clarence
how
strangely
you
act
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
well
your
brow
is
hot
said
she
laying
her
hand
on
his
forehead
you
have
been
travelling
too
much
for
your
strength
it
is
not
that
he
replied
i
feel
a
sense
of
suffocation
as
if
all
the
blood
was
rushing
to
my
throat
let
me
get
the
air
and
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
anne
hastened
and
brought
him
a
glass
of
water
of
which
he
drank
a
little
and
then
declared
himself
better
after
this
he
stood
for
a
long
time
with
her
clasped
in
his
arms
then
giving
her
one
or
two
passionate
kisses
he
strained
her
closer
to
him
and
abruptly
left
the
house
leaving
little
birdie
startled
and
alarmed
by
his
strange
behaviour
chapter
xxxii
dear
old
ess
again
let
us
visit
once
more
the
room
from
which
walters
and
his
friends
made
so
brave
a
defence
there
is
but
little
in
its
present
appearance
to
remind
one
of
that
eventful
night
no
reminiscences
of
that
desperate
attack
save
the
in
the
ceiling
which
walters
declares
shall
remain
unfilled
as
an
evidence
of
the
marked
attention
he
has
received
at
the
hands
of
his
there
are
several
noticeable
additions
to
the
furniture
of
the
apartment
amongst
them
an
upon
which
some
unfinished
articles
of
children
apparel
are
lying
a
capacious
and
grand
piano
then
opposite
to
the
portrait
of
toussaint
is
suspended
another
picture
which
no
doubt
holds
a
higher
position
in
the
regard
of
the
owner
of
the
mansion
than
the
african
warrior
aforesaid
it
is
a
likeness
of
the
lady
who
is
sitting
at
the
window
esther
walters
ellis
the
brown
baby
in
the
picture
is
the
little
girl
at
her
side
the
elder
sister
of
the
other
brown
baby
who
is
doing
its
best
to
pull
from
its
mother
lap
the
doll
dress
upon
which
she
is
sewing
yes
that
is
dear
old
ess
as
charlie
calls
her
yet
though
why
he
will
persist
in
applying
the
adjective
we
are
at
a
loss
to
determine
esther
looks
anything
but
old
a
trifle
matronly
we
admit
but
old
we
emphatically
say
she
is
not
her
hair
is
parted
plainly
and
the
tiniest
of
all
tiny
caps
sits
at
the
back
of
her
head
looking
as
if
it
felt
it
had
no
business
on
such
raven
black
hair
and
ought
to
be
ignominiously
dragged
off
without
one
word
of
apology
the
face
and
form
are
much
more
round
and
full
and
the
old
placid
expression
has
been
undisturbed
in
the
lapse
of
years
the
complexion
of
the
two
children
was
a
sort
of
compromise
between
the
complexions
of
their
parents
rollicking
little
pests
who
would
never
be
quiet
and
whose
little
black
buttons
of
eyes
were
always
peering
into
something
and
whose
little
plugs
of
fingers
would
in
spite
of
every
precaution
to
prevent
be
diving
into
mother
and
various
other
highly
inconvenient
and
inappropriate
places
there
said
esther
putting
the
last
stitch
into
a
doll
she
had
been
manufacturing
now
take
sister
and
go
away
and
play
but
little
sister
it
appeared
did
not
wish
to
be
taken
and
she
made
the
best
of
her
way
off
holding
on
by
the
chairs
and
tottering
over
the
great
gulfs
between
them
until
she
succeeded
in
reaching
the
where
she
paused
for
a
while
before
beginning
to
destroy
the
music
just
at
this
critical
juncture
a
young
lady
entered
the
room
and
held
up
her
hands
in
horror
and
baby
hastened
off
as
fast
as
her
toddling
limbs
could
carry
her
and
buried
her
face
in
her
mother
lap
in
great
consternation
emily
garie
made
two
or
three
slight
feints
of
an
endeavour
to
catch
her
and
then
sat
down
by
the
little
one
mother
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
have
you
answered
your
brother
letter
asked
esther
yes
i
have
she
replied
here
it
is
and
she
laid
the
letter
in
esther
lap
baby
made
a
desperate
effort
to
obtain
it
but
suffered
a
signal
defeat
and
her
mother
opened
it
and
read
dear
brother
i
read
your
chilling
letter
with
deep
sorrow
i
can
not
say
that
it
surprised
me
it
is
what
i
have
anticipated
during
the
many
months
that
i
have
been
silent
on
the
subject
of
my
marriage
yet
when
i
read
it
i
could
not
but
feel
a
pang
to
which
heretofore
i
have
been
a
stranger
clarence
you
know
i
love
you
and
should
not
make
the
sacrifice
you
demand
a
test
of
my
regard
true
i
can
not
say
and
most
heartily
i
regret
it
that
there
exists
between
us
the
same
extravagant
fondness
we
cherished
as
children
but
that
is
no
fault
of
mine
did
you
not
return
to
me
each
year
colder
and
colder
more
distant
and
unbrotherly
until
you
drove
back
to
their
source
the
gushing
streams
of
a
sister
love
that
flowed
so
strongly
towards
you
you
ask
me
to
resign
charles
ellis
and
come
to
you
what
can
you
offer
me
in
exchange
for
his
true
manly
affection
to
what
purpose
drive
from
my
heart
a
love
that
has
been
my
only
solace
only
consolation
for
your
waning
regard
we
have
grown
up
together
he
has
been
warm
and
kind
when
you
were
cold
and
indifferent
and
now
that
he
claims
the
reward
of
long
years
of
tender
regard
and
my
own
heart
is
conscious
that
he
deserves
it
you
would
step
between
us
and
forbid
me
yield
the
recompense
that
it
will
be
my
pride
and
delight
to
bestow
it
grieves
me
to
write
it
yet
i
must
clary
for
between
brother
and
sister
there
is
no
need
of
concealments
and
particularly
at
such
a
time
should
everything
be
open
clear
explicit
do
not
think
i
wish
to
reproach
you
what
you
are
clarence
your
false
position
and
unfortunate
education
have
made
you
i
write
it
with
pain
your
demand
seems
extremely
selfish
i
fear
it
is
not
of
but
of
you
are
thinking
when
you
ask
me
to
sever
at
once
and
for
ever
my
connection
with
a
people
who
you
say
can
only
degrade
me
yet
how
much
happier
am
i
sharing
their
degradation
than
you
appear
to
be
is
it
regard
for
me
that
induces
the
desire
that
i
should
share
the
life
of
constant
dread
that
i
can
not
but
feel
you
endure
or
do
you
fear
that
my
present
connections
will
interfere
with
your
own
plans
for
the
future
even
did
i
grant
it
was
my
happiness
alone
you
had
in
view
my
objections
would
be
equally
strong
i
could
not
forego
the
claims
of
early
friendship
and
estrange
myself
from
those
who
have
endeared
themselves
to
me
by
long
years
of
care
nor
pass
coldly
and
unrecognizingly
by
playmates
and
acquaintances
because
their
complexions
were
a
few
shades
darker
than
my
own
this
i
could
never
do
to
me
it
seems
ungrateful
yet
i
would
not
reproach
you
because
you
can
for
the
circumstances
by
which
you
have
been
surrounded
have
conspired
to
produce
that
result
and
i
presume
you
regard
such
conduct
as
necessary
to
sustain
you
in
your
present
position
from
the
tenor
of
your
letter
i
should
judge
that
you
entertained
some
fear
that
i
might
compromise
you
with
your
future
bride
and
intimate
that
choice
may
deprive
you
of
surely
that
need
not
be
need
not
even
know
of
my
existence
do
not
entertain
a
fear
that
i
or
my
future
husband
will
ever
interfere
with
your
happiness
by
thrusting
ourselves
upon
you
or
endanger
your
social
position
by
proclaiming
our
relationship
our
paths
lie
so
widely
apart
that
they
need
never
cross
you
walk
on
the
side
of
the
oppressor
i
thank
god
am
with
the
oppressed
i
am
happy
more
happy
i
am
sure
than
you
could
make
me
even
by
surrounding
me
with
the
glittering
lights
that
shine
upon
your
path
and
which
alas
may
one
day
go
suddenly
out
and
leave
you
wearily
groping
in
the
darkness
i
trust
dear
brother
my
words
may
not
prove
a
prophecy
yet
should
they
be
trust
me
clarence
you
may
come
back
again
and
a
sister
heart
will
receive
you
none
the
less
warmly
that
you
selfishly
desired
her
to
sacrifice
the
happiness
of
a
lifetime
to
you
i
shall
marry
charles
ellis
i
ask
you
to
come
and
see
us
united
i
shall
not
reproach
you
if
you
do
not
yet
i
shall
feel
strange
without
a
single
relative
to
kiss
or
bless
me
in
that
most
eventful
hour
of
a
life
god
bless
you
clary
i
trust
your
union
may
be
as
happy
as
i
anticipate
my
own
will
be
and
if
it
is
not
it
will
not
be
because
it
has
lacked
the
earnest
prayers
of
your
neglected
but
still
loving
sister
esther
i
thought
i
was
too
cold
in
that
tell
me
do
you
think
so
no
dear
not
at
all
i
think
it
a
most
affectionate
reply
to
a
cold
selfish
letter
oh
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
can
trust
better
to
your
tenderness
of
others
feelings
than
to
my
own
heart
i
felt
strongly
esther
and
was
fearful
that
it
might
be
too
harsh
or
reproachful
i
was
anxious
lest
my
feelings
should
be
too
strikingly
displayed
yet
it
was
better
to
be
explicit
do
you
think
so
undoubtedly
answered
esther
and
handing
back
the
letter
she
took
up
baby
and
seated
herself
in
the
now
baby
had
a
prejudice
against
caps
inveterate
and
unconquerable
and
grandmamma
nurse
and
esther
were
compelled
to
bear
the
brunt
of
her
antipathies
we
have
before
said
that
esther
cap
as
though
it
felt
itself
in
an
inappropriate
position
that
it
had
got
on
the
head
of
the
wrong
individual
and
baby
no
doubt
in
deference
to
the
feelings
tore
it
off
and
threw
it
in
the
piano
from
whence
it
was
extricated
with
great
detriment
to
the
delicate
lace
emily
took
a
seat
near
the
window
and
drawing
her
towards
her
raised
the
lid
this
presenting
another
opening
for
baby
she
slid
down
from
her
mother
lap
and
hastened
towards
her
she
just
arrived
in
time
to
see
it
safely
closed
and
toddled
back
to
her
mother
as
happy
as
if
she
had
succeeded
in
running
riot
over
its
contents
and
scattering
them
all
over
the
floor
emily
kept
looking
down
the
street
as
though
in
anxious
expectation
of
somebody
and
whilst
she
stood
there
there
was
an
opportunity
of
observing
how
little
she
had
changed
in
the
length
of
years
she
is
little
em
magnified
with
a
trifle
less
of
the
child
in
her
face
her
hair
has
a
slight
kink
is
a
little
more
wavy
than
is
customary
in
persons
of
entire
white
blood
but
in
no
other
way
is
her
extraction
perceptible
only
the
initiated
searching
for
evidences
of
african
blood
would
at
all
notice
this
slight
peculiarity
her
expectation
was
no
doubt
about
to
be
gratified
for
a
smile
broke
over
her
face
as
she
left
the
window
and
skipped
downstairs
when
she
she
was
accompanied
by
her
intended
husband
there
was
great
commotion
amongst
the
little
folk
in
consequence
of
this
new
arrival
baby
kicked
and
screamed
out
unker
char
and
went
almost
frantic
because
her
dress
became
entangled
in
the
buckle
of
her
mamma
belt
and
her
sister
received
a
kiss
before
she
could
be
extricated
charlie
is
greatly
altered
he
is
tall
remarkably
athletic
with
a
large
head
covered
with
woolly
hair
high
forehead
heavy
eyebrows
large
nose
and
a
mouth
of
ordinary
size
filled
with
beautifully
white
teeth
which
he
displays
at
almost
every
word
he
speaks
chin
broad
and
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
thoughtful
and
commanding
yet
replete
with
good
humour
no
one
would
call
him
handsome
yet
there
was
something
decidedly
attractive
in
his
general
appearance
no
one
would
recognize
him
as
the
charlie
of
old
whose
escapades
had
so
destroyed
the
comfort
and
harmony
of
thomas
establishment
and
only
once
when
he
held
up
the
baby
and
threatened
to
let
her
tear
the
paper
ornaments
from
the
chandelier
was
there
a
twinkle
of
the
charlie
of
old
looking
out
of
his
eyes
how
are
mother
and
father
asked
esther
oh
both
well
i
left
them
only
a
few
minutes
ago
at
the
dinner
table
i
had
to
hurry
off
to
go
to
the
office
so
i
perceive
observed
esther
archly
and
of
course
coming
here
which
is
four
squares
out
of
your
way
will
get
you
there
much
sooner
emily
blushed
and
said
smilingly
esther
was
a
very
impertinent
person
and
in
this
opinion
charlie
fully
concurred
they
then
walked
to
the
window
where
they
stood
saying
no
doubt
to
each
other
those
little
tender
things
which
are
so
profoundly
interesting
to
lovers
and
so
exceedingly
stupid
to
every
one
else
baby
in
high
glee
was
seated
on
charlie
shoulder
where
she
could
clutch
both
hands
in
his
hair
and
pull
until
the
tears
almost
started
from
his
eyes
emily
and
you
have
been
talking
a
long
while
and
i
presume
you
have
fully
decided
on
what
day
you
are
both
to
be
rescued
from
your
misery
and
when
i
am
to
have
the
exquisite
satisfaction
of
having
my
house
completely
turned
upside
down
for
your
mutual
benefit
said
esther
i
trust
it
will
be
as
soon
as
possible
as
we
can
not
rationally
expect
that
either
of
you
will
be
bearable
until
it
is
all
over
and
you
find
yourselves
ordinary
mortals
again
come
now
out
with
it
when
is
it
to
be
i
say
next
week
cried
charlie
next
week
indeed
hastily
rejoined
emily
i
could
not
think
of
such
a
thing
so
abrupt
so
abrupt
repeated
charlie
with
a
laugh
why
have
i
been
courting
you
ever
since
i
wore
roundabouts
and
has
everybody
been
expecting
us
to
be
married
every
week
within
the
last
two
years
fie
em
it
anything
but
abrupt
emily
blushed
still
deeper
and
looked
out
of
the
window
down
the
street
and
up
the
street
but
did
not
find
anything
in
the
prospect
at
either
side
that
at
all
assisted
her
to
come
to
a
decision
so
she
only
became
more
confused
and
stared
the
harder
at
last
she
ventured
to
suggest
that
day
two
months
this
day
two
months
outrageous
said
charlie
come
here
dear
old
ess
and
help
me
to
convince
this
deluded
girl
of
the
preposterous
manner
in
which
she
is
conducting
herself
i
must
join
her
side
if
you
bring
me
into
the
discussion
i
think
she
is
right
charlie
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
the
house
to
procure
and
furnish
and
numberless
other
things
that
you
hasty
and
absurd
men
know
nothing
about
by
dint
of
strong
persuasion
from
charlie
emily
finally
consented
to
abate
two
weeks
of
the
time
and
they
decided
that
a
family
council
should
be
held
that
evening
at
ellis
when
the
whole
arrangements
should
be
definitely
settled
a
note
was
accordingly
despatched
by
esther
to
her
mother
that
she
accompanied
by
emily
and
the
children
would
come
to
them
early
in
the
afternoon
and
that
the
gentlemen
would
join
them
in
the
evening
at
caddy
was
of
course
completely
upset
by
the
intelligence
for
notwithstanding
that
she
and
the
lived
in
an
almost
perpetual
state
of
nothing
appeared
to
her
to
be
in
order
and
worse
than
all
there
was
nothing
to
eat
nothing
to
eat
exclaimed
ellis
why
my
dear
child
there
are
all
manner
of
preserves
plenty
of
fresh
peaches
to
cut
and
sugar
down
and
a
large
in
the
house
and
any
quantity
of
bread
can
be
purchased
at
the
baker
bread
plain
bread
rejoined
caddy
indignantly
quite
astonished
at
her
mother
modest
idea
of
a
tea
and
a
at
that
do
you
think
mother
i
set
walters
down
to
plain
bread
when
we
always
have
hot
rolls
and
at
their
house
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
they
must
have
some
kind
of
hot
cake
be
the
consequences
what
they
may
caddy
bustled
herself
about
and
hurried
up
the
in
an
astonishing
manner
and
before
the
company
arrived
had
everything
prepared
and
looked
as
trim
and
neat
herself
as
if
she
had
never
touched
a
and
did
not
know
what
an
oven
was
used
for
behold
them
all
assembled
ellis
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
a
grandchild
on
each
side
of
her
and
her
pinned
upon
the
side
next
to
baby
esther
sits
opposite
her
husband
who
is
grown
a
little
grey
but
otherwise
is
not
in
the
least
altered
next
to
her
is
her
father
almost
buried
in
a
large
where
he
sits
shaking
his
head
from
time
to
time
and
smiling
vacantly
at
the
children
then
come
emily
and
charlie
at
the
foot
and
at
his
other
hand
caddy
and
kinch
kinch
the
invincible
kinch
the
dirty
kinch
the
mischievous
now
metamorphosed
into
a
dandy
with
faultless
linen
elegant
vest
and
coat
oh
kinch
what
a
change
from
the
most
shabby
and
careless
of
all
boys
to
a
consummate
exquisite
with
heavy
gold
watch
and
and
who
has
been
known
to
dress
regularly
twice
a
day
there
was
a
mighty
pouring
out
of
tea
at
ellis
end
of
the
table
and
baby
of
course
had
to
be
served
first
with
some
milk
and
bread
between
her
and
the
cat
intimate
relations
seemed
to
exist
for
by
their
united
efforts
the
first
cap
was
soon
disposed
of
and
baby
was
clamouring
for
the
second
before
the
elder
portions
of
the
family
had
been
once
served
round
with
tea
charlie
and
emily
ate
little
and
whispered
a
great
deal
but
kinch
the
voracity
of
whose
appetite
had
not
at
all
diminished
in
the
length
of
years
makes
up
for
their
abstinence
by
devouring
the
delicious
round
with
astonishing
rapidity
he
did
not
pretend
to
make
more
than
two
bites
to
a
cake
and
they
slipped
away
down
his
throat
as
if
it
was
a
railroad
tunnel
and
they
were
a
train
of
cars
behind
time
caddy
felt
constrained
to
get
up
every
few
moments
to
look
after
something
and
to
assure
herself
by
personal
inspection
that
the
reserved
supplies
in
the
kitchen
were
not
likely
to
be
exhausted
esther
occupied
herself
in
attending
upon
her
helpless
father
and
fed
him
as
tenderly
and
carefully
as
if
he
was
one
of
her
babies
i
left
you
ladies
in
council
what
was
decided
said
charlie
do
be
at
all
bashful
as
regards
speaking
before
kinch
for
he
is
in
the
secret
and
has
been
these
two
months
kinch
is
to
be
groomsman
and
has
had
three
tailors
at
work
on
his
suit
for
a
fortnight
past
he
told
me
this
morning
that
if
you
did
not
hurry
matters
up
his
wedding
coat
would
be
a
week
out
of
fashion
before
he
should
get
a
chance
to
wear
it
how
delightful
kinch
to
be
groomsman
said
esther
that
is
very
kind
in
you
kinch
to
assist
us
to
get
charlie
off
our
hands
and
who
is
to
be
bridesmaid
asked
walters
oh
caddy
of
course
i
could
have
any
one
but
caddy
blushingly
answered
emily
that
is
capital
cried
charlie
giving
kinch
a
facetious
poke
just
the
thing
is
it
kinch
it
will
get
her
accustomed
to
these
matters
you
remember
what
you
told
me
this
morning
eh
old
boy
he
concluded
archly
kinch
tried
to
blush
but
being
very
his
efforts
in
that
direction
were
not
at
all
apparent
so
he
evidenced
his
confusion
by
cramming
a
whole
into
his
mouth
and
almost
caused
a
stoppage
in
the
tunnel
caddy
became
excessively
red
in
the
face
and
was
sure
they
wanted
more
cakes
but
walters
was
equally
confident
they
did
not
and
put
his
back
against
the
door
and
stood
there
whilst
ellis
gravely
informed
them
that
she
soon
expected
to
be
her
own
housekeeper
for
that
she
had
detected
caddy
and
kinch
in
a
furniture
establishment
pricing
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
and
that
kinch
had
unblushingly
told
her
they
had
for
some
time
been
engaged
to
be
married
but
somehow
or
other
had
forgotten
to
mention
it
to
her
this
caused
a
general
shout
of
laughter
around
the
table
in
which
baby
tumultuously
joined
and
rattled
her
spoon
against
the
until
she
almost
deafened
them
this
noise
frightened
ellis
who
cried
there
they
come
there
they
come
and
cowered
down
in
his
great
chair
and
looked
so
exceedingly
terrified
that
the
noise
was
hushed
instantly
and
tears
sprang
into
the
eyes
of
dear
old
ess
who
rose
and
stood
by
him
and
laid
his
withered
face
upon
her
soft
warm
bosom
smoothed
down
the
thin
grey
hair
and
held
him
close
to
her
throbbing
tender
heart
until
the
wild
light
vanished
from
his
bleared
and
sunken
eyes
and
the
vacant
childish
smile
came
back
on
his
thin
wan
face
again
when
she
said
pray
do
laugh
so
very
loud
it
alarms
father
he
is
composed
now
pray
do
startle
him
so
again
this
sobered
them
down
a
little
and
they
quietly
recommenced
discussing
the
matrimonial
arrangements
but
they
were
all
in
such
capital
spirits
that
an
occasional
hearty
and
laugh
could
not
be
suppressed
walters
acted
in
his
usual
handsome
manner
and
facetiously
collaring
charlie
took
him
into
a
corner
and
informed
him
that
he
had
an
empty
house
that
be
wished
him
to
occupy
and
that
if
he
ever
whispered
the
word
rent
or
offered
him
any
money
before
he
was
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
he
should
believe
that
he
wanted
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
and
should
refer
him
to
a
friend
and
then
pistols
and
coffee
would
be
the
inevitable
result
then
it
came
out
that
caddy
and
kinch
had
been
courting
for
some
time
if
not
with
ellis
verbal
consent
with
at
least
no
objection
from
that
good
lady
for
master
kinch
besides
being
an
exceedingly
fellow
was
very
snug
in
his
boots
and
had
a
good
many
thousand
dollars
at
his
disposal
bequeathed
him
by
his
father
the
fates
had
conspired
to
make
that
old
gentleman
rich
he
owned
a
number
of
lots
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
on
which
he
had
been
paying
taxes
a
number
of
years
and
he
awoke
one
fine
morning
to
find
them
worth
a
large
sum
of
money
the
city
council
having
determined
to
cut
a
street
just
beside
them
and
the
property
all
around
being
in
the
hands
of
wealthy
and
fashionable
people
his
own
proved
to
be
exceedingly
valuable
it
was
a
sad
day
for
the
old
man
as
kinch
and
his
mother
insisted
that
he
should
give
up
business
which
he
did
most
reluctantly
and
kinch
had
to
be
incessantly
on
the
watch
thereafter
to
prevent
him
from
hiring
cellars
and
sequestering
their
old
clothes
to
set
up
in
business
again
they
were
both
gone
now
and
kinch
was
his
own
master
with
a
income
of
a
thousand
dollars
with
a
prospect
of
a
large
increase
they
talked
matters
over
fully
and
settled
all
their
arrangements
before
the
time
for
parting
and
then
finding
the
baby
had
scrambled
into
ellis
lap
and
gone
fast
asleep
and
that
it
was
long
after
ten
each
departed
taking
their
several
ways
for
home
chapter
xxxiii
the
fatal
discovery
there
is
great
bustle
and
confusion
in
the
house
of
bates
and
milliners
are
coming
in
at
unearthly
hours
and
consultations
of
deep
importance
are
being
duly
held
with
maiden
aunts
and
the
young
ladies
who
are
to
officiate
as
bridesmaids
at
the
approaching
ceremony
there
are
daily
excursions
to
drapers
establishments
and
jewellers
and
in
fact
so
much
to
be
done
and
thought
of
that
little
birdie
is
in
constant
confusion
and
her
dear
little
curly
head
is
almost
turned
twenty
times
in
each
day
is
she
called
upstairs
to
where
the
sempstresses
are
at
work
to
have
something
tried
on
or
fitted
poor
little
birdie
she
declares
she
never
can
stand
it
she
did
not
dream
that
to
be
married
she
would
have
been
subjected
to
such
a
world
of
trouble
or
she
would
never
have
consented
and
then
clarence
too
comes
in
every
morning
and
remains
half
the
day
teasing
her
to
play
to
talk
or
sing
inconsiderate
clarence
when
she
has
so
much
on
her
mind
and
when
at
last
he
goes
and
she
begins
to
felicitate
herself
that
she
is
rid
of
him
back
he
comes
again
in
the
evening
and
repeats
the
same
annoyance
o
naughty
tiresome
clarence
how
can
you
plague
little
birdie
so
perhaps
you
think
she
does
dislike
it
you
may
be
right
very
likely
she
does
she
sometimes
wonders
why
he
grows
paler
and
thinner
each
day
and
his
nervous
and
sometimes
distracted
manner
teases
her
dreadfully
but
she
supposes
all
lovers
act
thus
and
expects
they
can
not
help
it
and
then
little
birdie
takes
a
sly
peep
in
the
glass
and
does
not
so
much
wonder
after
all
yet
if
she
sometimes
deems
his
manner
startling
and
odd
what
would
she
say
if
she
knew
that
night
after
night
when
he
left
her
side
he
wandered
for
long
hours
through
the
cold
and
dreary
streets
and
then
went
to
his
hotel
where
he
paced
his
room
until
almost
day
ah
little
birdie
a
smile
will
visit
his
pale
face
when
you
chirp
tenderly
to
him
and
a
faint
tinge
comes
upon
his
cheek
when
you
lay
your
soft
tiny
hand
upon
it
yet
all
the
while
there
is
that
desperate
secret
lying
next
his
heart
and
like
a
vampire
sucking
away
drop
by
drop
happiness
and
peace
not
so
with
little
birdie
she
is
happy
oh
happy
she
rises
with
a
song
upon
her
lips
and
is
chirping
in
the
sunshine
she
herself
creates
the
day
flowers
of
innocence
bloom
and
flourish
in
her
peaceful
lithesome
heart
poor
poor
little
birdie
those
flowers
are
destined
to
wither
soon
and
the
sunlight
fade
from
thy
happy
face
for
ever
one
morning
clarence
little
birdie
and
her
intended
bridesmaid
miss
ellstowe
were
chatting
together
when
a
card
was
handed
to
the
latter
who
on
looking
at
it
exclaimed
oh
dear
me
an
old
beau
of
mine
show
him
up
and
scampering
off
to
the
mirror
she
gave
a
hasty
glance
to
see
that
every
curl
was
in
its
effective
position
who
is
it
asked
little
birdie
all
alive
with
curiosity
do
say
who
it
is
hush
whispered
miss
ellstowe
here
he
comes
my
dear
he
is
very
rich
a
great
catch
are
my
curls
all
right
scarcely
had
she
asked
the
question
and
before
an
answer
could
be
returned
the
servant
announced
george
stevens
and
the
gentleman
walked
into
the
room
start
not
reader
it
is
not
the
old
man
we
left
bent
over
the
prostrate
form
of
his
unconscious
daughter
but
george
stevens
junior
the
son
and
heir
of
the
old
man
aforesaid
the
heart
of
clarence
almost
ceased
to
beat
at
the
sound
of
that
name
and
had
not
both
the
ladies
been
so
engrossed
in
observing
the
they
must
have
noticed
the
deep
flush
that
suffused
his
face
and
the
deathly
pallor
that
succeeded
it
stevens
was
presented
to
miss
bates
and
miss
ellstowe
turned
to
present
him
to
clarence
garie
stevens
said
she
clarence
bowed
pardon
me
i
did
not
catch
the
name
said
the
former
politely
clarence
garie
she
repeated
more
distinctly
george
stevens
bowed
and
then
sitting
down
opposite
clarence
eyed
him
for
a
few
moments
intently
i
think
we
have
met
before
said
he
at
last
in
a
cold
contemptuous
tone
not
unmingled
with
surprise
have
we
not
clarence
endeavoured
to
answer
but
could
not
he
was
for
a
moment
incapable
of
speech
a
slight
gurgling
noise
was
heard
in
his
throat
as
he
bowed
affirmatively
we
were
neighbours
at
one
time
i
think
added
george
stevens
we
were
faintly
ejaculated
clarence
it
is
a
great
surprise
to
me
to
meet
here
pursued
george
stevens
the
surprise
is
mutual
i
assure
you
sir
rejoined
clarence
coldly
and
with
slightly
agitated
manner
hereupon
ensued
an
embarrassing
pause
in
the
conversation
during
which
the
ladies
could
not
avoid
observing
the
livid
hue
of
clarence
face
there
was
a
perfect
tumult
raging
in
his
breast
he
knew
that
now
his
secret
would
be
brought
out
this
was
to
be
the
end
of
his
struggle
to
preserve
it
to
be
exposed
at
last
when
on
the
brink
of
consummating
his
happiness
as
he
sat
there
looking
at
george
stevens
he
became
a
murderer
in
his
heart
and
if
an
invisible
dagger
could
have
been
placed
in
his
hands
he
would
have
driven
it
to
the
hilt
in
his
breast
and
stilled
for
ever
the
tongue
that
was
destined
to
betray
him
but
it
was
too
late
one
glance
at
the
contemptuous
malignant
face
of
the
son
of
his
father
murderer
told
him
his
fate
was
sealed
that
it
was
now
too
late
to
avert
exposure
he
grew
faint
dizzy
ill
and
rising
declared
hurriedly
he
must
go
staggered
towards
the
door
and
fell
upon
the
carpet
with
a
slight
stream
of
blood
spirting
from
his
mouth
little
birdie
screamed
and
ran
to
raise
him
george
stevens
and
miss
ellstowe
gave
their
assistance
and
by
their
united
efforts
he
was
placed
upon
the
sofa
little
birdie
wiped
the
bloody
foam
from
his
mouth
with
her
tiny
lace
handkerchief
bathed
his
head
and
held
cold
water
to
his
lips
but
consciousness
was
long
returning
and
they
thought
he
was
dying
poor
torn
heart
pity
it
was
thy
beatings
were
not
stilled
then
for
ever
it
was
not
thy
fate
long
long
months
of
grief
and
despair
were
yet
to
come
before
the
end
approached
and
day
again
broke
upon
thee
just
at
this
crisis
bates
came
in
and
was
greatly
shocked
and
alarmed
by
clarence
deathly
appearance
as
he
returned
to
consciousness
he
looked
wildly
about
him
and
clasping
little
birdie
hand
in
his
gazed
at
her
with
a
tender
imploring
countenance
yet
it
was
a
despairing
look
such
a
one
as
a
shipwrecked
seaman
gives
when
in
sight
of
land
he
slowly
relaxes
his
hold
upon
the
sustaining
spar
that
he
has
no
longer
the
strength
to
clutch
and
sinks
for
ever
beneath
the
waters
a
physician
was
brought
in
who
declared
he
had
ruptured
a
minor
and
would
not
let
him
utter
a
whisper
and
assisted
by
bates
placed
him
in
his
carriage
and
the
three
were
driven
as
swiftly
as
possible
to
the
hotel
where
clarence
was
staying
little
birdie
retired
to
her
room
in
great
affliction
followed
by
miss
ellstowe
and
george
stevens
was
left
in
the
room
alone
what
can
the
fellow
have
been
doing
here
he
soliloquised
on
intimate
terms
too
apparently
it
is
very
singular
i
will
wait
miss
return
and
ask
an
explanation
when
miss
ellstowe
the
room
he
immediately
inquired
what
was
that
garie
doing
here
he
seems
on
an
exceedingly
intimate
footing
and
your
friend
apparently
takes
a
wonderful
interest
in
him
of
course
she
does
that
is
her
rejoined
he
with
an
air
of
astonishment
impossible
why
so
i
assure
you
he
is
they
are
to
be
married
in
a
few
weeks
i
am
here
to
officiate
as
bridesmaid
phew
whistled
george
stevens
and
then
after
pausing
a
moment
he
asked
do
you
know
anything
about
this
garie
anything
i
mean
respecting
his
family
why
no
that
is
nothing
very
definite
more
than
that
he
is
an
orphan
and
a
gentleman
of
education
and
independent
means
humph
ejaculated
george
stevens
significantly
humph
repeated
miss
ellstowe
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
anything
beyond
that
one
might
suppose
you
did
from
your
significant
looks
and
gestures
yes
i
know
something
about
this
garie
he
replied
after
a
short
silence
but
tell
me
what
kind
of
people
are
these
you
are
visiting
abolitionists
or
anything
of
that
sort
how
absurd
stevens
to
ask
such
a
question
of
course
they
are
not
said
she
indignantly
do
you
suppose
i
should
be
here
if
they
were
but
why
do
you
ask
is
this
garie
one
no
my
friend
answered
her
visitor
wish
that
was
that
was
all
how
strangely
you
talk
you
alarm
me
continued
she
with
considerable
agitation
if
you
know
anything
that
will
injure
the
happiness
of
my
friend
anything
respecting
garie
that
she
or
her
father
should
know
make
no
secret
of
it
but
disclose
it
to
me
at
once
anne
is
my
dearest
friend
and
i
of
course
must
be
interested
in
anything
that
concerns
her
happiness
tell
me
what
is
it
you
know
it
is
nothing
i
assure
you
that
it
will
give
me
any
pleasure
to
tell
answered
he
do
speak
out
stevens
is
there
any
stain
on
his
character
or
that
of
his
family
did
he
ever
do
anything
dishonourable
wish
that
was
coolly
repeated
george
stevens
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
villain
and
has
been
imposing
himself
upon
this
family
for
what
he
is
not
good
heavens
stevens
how
is
he
a
villain
or
impostor
you
all
suppose
him
to
be
a
white
man
do
you
not
he
asked
of
course
we
do
she
promptly
answered
then
you
are
all
grievously
mistaken
for
he
is
not
did
you
not
notice
how
he
changed
colour
how
agitated
he
became
when
i
was
presented
it
was
because
he
knew
that
his
exposure
was
at
hand
i
know
him
well
in
fact
he
is
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
deceased
relative
of
mine
by
a
mulatto
slave
it
can
not
be
possible
exclaimed
miss
ellstowe
with
a
wild
stare
of
astonishment
are
you
sure
of
it
sure
of
it
of
course
i
am
i
should
indeed
be
a
rash
man
to
make
such
a
terrible
charge
unless
perfectly
able
to
substantiate
it
i
have
played
with
him
frequently
when
a
child
and
my
father
made
a
very
liberal
provision
for
this
young
man
and
his
sister
after
the
death
of
their
father
who
lost
his
life
through
imprudently
living
with
this
woman
in
philadelphia
and
consequently
getting
himself
mixed
up
with
these
detestable
abolitionists
can
this
be
true
asked
miss
ellstowe
incredulously
i
assure
you
it
is
we
had
quite
lost
sight
of
them
for
a
few
years
back
and
i
little
supposed
we
should
meet
under
such
circumstances
i
fear
i
shall
be
the
cause
of
great
discomfort
but
i
am
sure
in
the
end
i
shall
be
thanked
i
could
not
with
any
sense
of
honour
or
propriety
permit
such
a
thing
as
this
marriage
to
be
consummated
without
at
least
warning
your
friends
of
the
real
position
of
this
fellow
i
trust
miss
ellstowe
you
will
inform
them
of
what
i
have
told
you
how
can
i
oh
mr
stevens
said
she
in
a
tone
of
deep
distress
this
will
be
a
terrible
blow
it
will
almost
kill
anne
no
no
the
task
must
not
devolve
on
me
i
can
not
tell
them
poor
little
thing
it
will
break
her
heart
i
am
afraid
oh
but
you
must
miss
ellstowe
it
would
seem
very
impertinent
in
me
a
stranger
to
meddle
in
such
a
matter
and
besides
they
may
be
aware
of
it
and
not
thank
me
for
my
interference
no
i
assure
you
they
are
not
i
am
confident
they
have
not
the
most
distant
idea
of
such
a
thing
they
would
undoubtedly
regard
it
as
an
act
of
kindness
on
your
part
i
shall
insist
upon
your
remaining
until
the
return
of
bates
when
i
shall
beg
you
to
repeat
to
him
what
you
have
already
revealed
to
me
as
you
insist
upon
it
i
suppose
i
must
repeated
he
after
some
reflection
but
i
must
say
i
do
not
like
the
office
of
informer
concluded
he
with
assumed
reluctance
i
am
sorry
to
impose
it
upon
you
yet
rest
assured
they
will
thank
you
excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
i
will
go
and
see
how
anne
is
miss
ellstowe
returned
after
a
short
interval
with
the
information
that
little
birdie
was
much
more
composed
and
would
no
doubt
soon
recover
from
her
fright
to
receive
a
worse
blow
observed
george
stevens
i
pity
the
poor
little
thing
only
to
think
of
the
disgrace
of
being
engaged
to
a
nigger
it
is
fortunate
for
them
that
they
will
make
the
discovery
ere
it
be
too
late
heavens
only
think
what
the
consequences
might
have
been
had
she
married
this
fellow
and
his
peculiar
position
became
known
to
them
afterwards
she
would
have
been
completely
for
thus
conversing
respecting
clarence
they
awaited
the
return
of
bates
after
the
lapse
of
a
couple
of
hours
he
entered
the
stevens
was
presented
to
him
by
miss
ellstowe
as
a
particular
friend
of
herself
and
family
i
believe
you
were
here
when
i
came
in
before
i
regret
i
was
obliged
to
leave
so
abruptly
courteously
spoke
bates
whilst
bowing
to
his
new
acquaintance
the
sudden
and
alarming
illness
of
my
young
friend
will
i
trust
be
a
sufficient
apology
how
is
he
now
asked
miss
ellstowe
better
much
better
answered
he
cheerfully
but
very
wild
and
distracted
in
his
manner
alarmingly
so
in
fact
he
clung
to
my
hand
and
wrung
it
when
we
parted
and
bid
me
good
bye
again
and
again
as
if
it
was
for
the
last
time
poor
fellow
he
is
frightened
at
that
hemorrhage
and
is
afraid
it
will
be
fatal
but
there
is
not
any
danger
he
only
requires
to
be
kept
quiet
he
will
soon
come
round
again
no
doubt
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
again
said
he
in
conclusion
i
must
go
and
see
my
daughter
bates
was
rising
to
depart
when
george
stevens
gave
miss
ellstowe
a
significant
look
who
said
in
a
hesitating
tone
bates
one
moment
before
you
go
my
friend
stevens
has
a
communication
to
make
to
you
respecting
garie
which
will
i
fear
cause
you
as
it
already
has
me
deep
distress
indeed
rejoined
bates
in
a
tone
of
surprise
what
is
it
nothing
that
reflects
upon
his
character
i
hope
i
do
not
know
how
my
information
will
influence
your
conduct
towards
him
for
i
do
not
know
what
your
sentiments
may
be
respecting
such
persons
i
know
society
in
general
do
not
receive
them
and
my
surprise
was
very
great
to
find
him
here
i
do
not
understand
you
what
do
you
mean
demanded
bates
in
a
tone
of
perplexity
has
he
ever
committed
any
crime
he
is
a
coloured
man
answered
george
stevens
briefly
bates
became
almost
purple
and
gasped
for
breath
then
after
staring
at
his
informant
for
a
few
seconds
incredulously
repeated
the
words
coloured
man
in
a
dreamy
manner
as
if
in
doubt
whether
he
had
really
heard
them
yes
coloured
man
said
george
stevens
confidently
it
grieves
me
to
be
the
medium
of
such
disagreeable
intelligence
and
i
assure
you
i
only
undertook
the
office
upon
the
representation
of
miss
ellstowe
that
you
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
and
would
regard
my
communication
as
an
act
of
kindness
it
it
be
exclaimed
bates
with
the
air
of
a
man
determined
not
to
be
convinced
of
a
disagreeable
truth
it
can
not
be
possible
hereupon
george
stevens
related
to
him
what
he
had
recently
told
miss
ellstowe
respecting
the
parentage
and
position
of
clarence
during
the
narration
the
old
man
became
almost
frantic
with
rage
and
sorrow
bursting
forth
once
or
twice
with
the
most
violent
exclamations
and
when
george
stevens
concluded
he
rose
and
said
in
a
husky
voice
i
kill
him
the
infernal
hypocrite
oh
the
impostor
to
come
to
my
house
in
this
nefarious
manner
and
steal
the
affections
of
my
daughter
the
devilish
villain
a
bastard
a
contemptible
nigger
oh
my
child
my
child
it
will
break
your
heart
when
you
know
what
deep
disgrace
has
come
upon
you
i
go
to
him
added
he
his
face
flushed
and
his
white
hair
almost
erect
with
rage
i
murder
him
there
not
a
man
in
the
city
will
blame
me
for
it
and
he
grasped
his
cane
as
though
he
would
go
at
once
and
inflict
summary
vengeance
upon
the
offender
stop
sir
do
be
rash
exclaimed
george
stevens
i
would
not
screen
this
fellow
from
the
effects
of
your
just
and
very
natural
indignation
he
is
abundantly
worthy
of
the
severest
punishment
you
can
bestow
but
if
you
go
in
your
present
excited
state
you
might
be
tempted
to
do
something
which
would
make
this
whole
affair
public
and
injure
thereby
your
daughter
future
you
pardon
me
i
trust
and
not
think
me
presuming
upon
my
short
acquaintance
in
making
the
suggestion
bates
looked
about
him
bewilderedly
for
a
short
time
and
then
replied
no
no
you
need
not
apologize
you
are
right
i
thank
you
i
myself
should
have
known
better
but
my
poor
child
what
will
become
of
her
and
in
an
agony
of
sorrow
he
resumed
his
seat
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
george
stevens
prepared
to
take
his
departure
but
bates
pressed
him
to
remain
in
a
little
while
said
he
i
shall
be
more
composed
and
then
i
wish
you
to
go
with
me
to
this
worthless
scoundrel
i
must
see
him
at
once
and
warn
him
what
the
consequences
will
be
should
he
dare
approach
my
child
again
do
fear
me
he
added
as
he
saw
george
stevens
hesitated
to
remain
that
whirlwind
of
passion
is
over
now
i
promise
you
i
shall
do
nothing
unworthy
of
myself
or
my
child
it
was
not
long
before
they
departed
together
for
the
hotel
at
which
clarence
was
staying
when
they
entered
his
room
they
found
him
in
his
bed
with
the
miniature
of
little
birdie
in
his
hands
when
he
observed
the
dark
scowl
on
the
face
of
bates
and
saw
by
whom
he
was
accompanied
he
knew
his
secret
was
discovered
he
saw
it
written
on
their
faces
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
and
his
heart
seemed
like
a
lump
of
ice
in
his
bosom
bates
was
about
to
speak
when
clarence
held
up
his
hand
in
the
attitude
of
one
endeavouring
to
ward
off
a
blow
and
whispered
hoarsely
do
tell
me
not
yet
a
little
longer
i
see
you
know
all
i
see
my
sentence
written
on
your
face
let
me
dream
a
little
longer
ere
you
speak
the
words
that
must
for
ever
part
me
and
little
birdie
i
know
you
have
come
to
separate
us
but
do
tell
me
yet
for
when
you
do
said
he
in
an
agonized
tone
it
will
kill
me
i
wish
to
god
it
would
rejoined
bates
i
wish
you
had
died
long
ago
then
you
would
have
never
come
beneath
my
roof
to
destroy
its
peace
for
ever
you
have
acted
basely
palming
yourself
upon
us
counterfeit
as
you
were
and
taking
in
exchange
her
true
love
and
my
honest
honourable
regard
clarence
attempted
to
speak
but
bates
glared
at
him
and
continued
there
are
laws
to
punish
thieves
and
counterfeits
but
such
as
you
may
go
unchastised
except
by
the
abhorrence
of
all
honourable
men
had
you
been
unaware
of
your
origin
and
had
the
revelation
of
this
gentleman
been
as
new
to
you
as
to
me
you
would
have
deserved
sympathy
but
you
have
been
acting
a
lie
claiming
a
position
in
society
to
which
you
knew
you
had
no
right
and
deserve
execration
and
contempt
did
i
treat
you
as
my
feelings
dictated
you
would
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
weight
of
a
father
anger
but
i
do
not
wish
the
world
to
know
that
my
daughter
has
been
wasting
her
affections
upon
a
worthless
nigger
that
is
all
that
protects
you
now
hear
me
he
added
fiercely
if
ever
you
presume
to
darken
my
door
again
or
attempt
to
approach
my
daughter
i
will
shoot
you
as
sure
as
you
sit
there
before
me
and
serve
you
perfectly
right
observed
george
stevens
silence
sir
rejoined
clarence
sternly
how
dare
you
interfere
he
may
say
what
he
likes
reproach
me
as
he
pleases
is
father
i
have
no
other
reply
but
if
you
dare
again
to
utter
a
word
i
and
clarence
paused
and
looked
about
him
as
if
in
search
of
something
with
which
to
enforce
silence
as
he
was
there
was
an
air
of
determination
about
him
which
commanded
acquiescence
and
george
stevens
did
not
venture
upon
another
observation
during
the
interview
i
want
my
daughter
letters
every
line
she
ever
wrote
to
you
get
them
at
once
i
want
them
now
said
bates
imperatively
i
can
not
give
them
to
you
immediately
they
are
not
accessible
at
present
does
she
want
them
he
asked
feebly
has
she
desired
to
have
them
back
never
mind
that
said
the
old
man
sternly
no
evasions
give
me
the
letters
i
will
send
them
said
clarence
i
will
read
them
all
over
once
again
thought
he
i
can
not
believe
you
said
bates
i
promise
you
upon
my
honour
i
will
send
them
tomorrow
nigger
honour
rejoined
bates
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
yes
sir
a
nigger
honour
repeated
clarence
the
colour
mounting
to
his
pale
cheeks
a
few
drops
of
negro
blood
in
a
man
reins
do
not
entirely
deprive
him
of
noble
sentiments
is
true
my
past
concealment
does
not
argue
in
my
i
concealed
that
which
was
no
fault
of
my
own
but
what
the
injustice
of
society
has
made
a
crime
i
am
not
here
for
discussion
and
i
suppose
i
must
trust
to
your
interrupted
bates
with
a
sneer
but
remember
if
the
letters
are
not
forthcoming
i
shall
be
here
again
and
then
concluded
he
in
a
threatening
tone
my
visit
will
not
be
as
harmless
as
this
has
been
after
they
had
gone
clarence
rose
and
walked
feebly
to
his
desk
which
with
great
effort
and
risk
he
removed
to
the
then
taking
from
it
little
birdie
letters
he
began
their
perusal
ay
read
them
again
and
yet
again
pore
over
their
contents
dwell
on
those
passages
replete
with
tenderness
until
every
word
is
stamped
upon
thy
breaking
heart
linger
by
them
as
the
weary
traveller
amid
sand
pauses
by
some
sparkling
fountain
in
a
shady
oasis
tasting
of
its
pure
waters
ere
he
launches
forth
again
upon
the
arid
waste
beyond
this
is
the
last
green
spot
upon
thy
way
to
death
beyond
whose
grim
portals
let
us
believe
thou
and
thy
little
birdie
may
meet
again
chapter
xxxiv
murder
will
out
the
city
clocks
had
just
tolled
out
the
hour
of
twelve
the
last
omnibus
had
rumbled
by
and
the
silence
without
was
broken
only
at
rare
intervals
when
some
belated
citizen
passed
by
with
hurried
footsteps
towards
his
home
all
was
still
in
the
house
of
stevens
so
quiet
that
the
ticking
of
the
large
clock
in
the
hall
could
be
distinctly
heard
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
breaking
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
night
with
its
monotonous
click
click
click
click
in
a
richly
furnished
chamber
overlooking
the
street
a
dim
light
was
burning
so
dimly
in
fact
that
the
emaciated
form
of
stevens
was
scarcely
discernible
amidst
the
pillows
and
covering
of
the
bed
on
which
he
was
lying
above
him
a
brass
head
of
curious
workmanship
held
in
its
clenched
teeth
the
canopy
that
overshadowed
the
bed
and
as
the
light
occasionally
flickered
and
brightened
the
curiously
carved
face
seemed
to
light
up
with
a
sort
of
sardonic
grin
and
the
grating
of
the
as
the
sick
man
tossed
from
side
to
side
in
his
bed
would
have
suggested
the
idea
that
the
odd
supporter
of
the
canopy
was
gnashing
his
brazen
teeth
at
him
on
the
wall
immediately
opposite
the
light
hung
a
portrait
of
stevens
not
the
sharp
hard
face
we
once
introduced
to
the
reader
but
a
smoother
softer
countenance
yet
a
worn
and
melancholy
one
in
its
expression
it
looked
as
if
the
waves
of
grief
had
beaten
upon
it
for
a
long
succession
of
years
until
they
had
tempered
down
its
harsher
peculiarities
giving
a
subdued
appearance
to
the
whole
countenance
there
is
twelve
give
me
my
drops
again
lizzie
he
remarked
faintly
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
lizzie
emerged
from
behind
the
curtains
and
essayed
to
pour
into
a
glass
the
proper
quantity
of
medicine
she
was
twice
obliged
to
pour
back
into
the
phial
what
she
had
just
emptied
forth
as
the
trembling
of
her
hands
caused
her
each
time
to
drop
too
much
at
last
having
succeeded
in
getting
the
exact
number
of
drops
she
handed
him
the
glass
the
contents
of
which
he
eagerly
drank
there
said
he
thank
you
now
perhaps
i
may
sleep
i
have
not
slept
for
two
nights
such
has
been
my
anxiety
about
that
man
nor
you
either
my
child
i
have
kept
you
awake
also
you
can
sleep
though
without
drops
when
you
are
prepared
to
start
wake
me
if
i
am
asleep
and
let
me
speak
to
you
before
you
go
remember

frighten
him
if
you
can
tell
him
i
am
ill
myself
that
i
ca
survive
this
continued
worriment
and
annoyance
tell
him
moreover
i
am
not
made
of
gold
and
will
not
be
always
giving
i
do
believe
he
is
sick
dying
do
you
he
asked
looking
into
her
face
as
though
he
did
not
anticipate
an
affirmative
answer
no
father
i
do
think
he
is
really
ill
i
imagine
it
is
another
subterfuge
to
extract
money
do
distress
yourself
unnecessarily
perhaps
i
may
have
some
influence
with
him
i
had
before
you
know
yes
yes
dear
you
managed
him
very
well
that
time
very
well
said
he
stroking
down
her
hair
affectionately
i
i
my
child
i
could
never
have
told
you
of
that
dreadful
secret
but
when
i
found
that
you
knew
it
all
my
heart
experienced
a
sensible
relief
it
was
a
selfish
pleasure
i
know
yet
it
eased
me
to
share
my
secret
the
burden
is
not
half
so
heavy
now
father
would
not
your
mind
be
easier
still
if
you
could
be
persuaded
to
make
restitution
to
his
children
this
wealth
is
valueless
to
us
both
you
can
never
ask
forgiveness
for
the
sin
whilst
you
cling
thus
tenaciously
to
its
fruits
tut
tut
no
more
of
that
said
he
impatiently
i
can
not
do
it
without
betraying
myself
if
i
gave
it
back
to
them
what
would
become
of
you
and
george
and
how
am
i
to
stop
the
clamours
of
that
cormorant
no
no
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
it
i
can
not
do
it
there
would
be
still
enough
left
for
george
after
restoring
them
their
own
and
you
might
give
this
man
my
share
of
what
is
left
i
would
rather
work
day
and
night
said
she
determinedly
than
ever
touch
a
penny
of
the
money
thus
accumulated
i
thought
all
that
over
long
ago
but
i
dare
not
do
it
it
might
cause
inquiries
to
be
made
that
might
result
to
my
disadvantage
no
i
can
not
do
that
sit
down
and
let
us
be
quiet
now
stevens
lay
back
upon
his
pillow
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
doze
then
starting
up
again
suddenly
he
asked
have
you
told
george
about
it
have
you
ever
confided
anything
to
him
no
papa
answered
she
soothingly
not
a
breath
i
been
secret
as
the
grave
that
right
rejoined
he
that
is
right
i
love
george
but
not
as
i
do
you
he
only
comes
to
me
when
he
wants
money
he
is
not
like
you
darling
you
take
care
of
and
nurse
your
poor
old
father
has
he
come
in
yet
not
yet
he
never
gets
home
until
almost
morning
and
is
then
often
fearfully
intoxicated
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
muttered
the
sins
of
the
fathers
shall
what
is
that
did
you
hear
that
noise
hush
lizzie
stood
quietly
by
him
for
a
short
while
and
then
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
it
is
george
said
she
after
peering
into
the
gloom
of
their
entry
he
has
admitted
him
self
with
his
the
shuffling
sound
of
footsteps
was
now
quite
audible
upon
the
stairway
and
soon
the
bloated
face
of
stevens
hopeful
son
was
seen
at
the
chamber
door
in
society
and
places
where
this
young
gentleman
desired
to
maintain
a
respectable
character
he
could
be
as
well
behaved
as
choice
in
his
language
and
as
courteous
as
anybody
but
at
home
where
he
was
well
known
and
where
he
did
not
care
to
place
himself
under
any
restraint
he
was
a
very
different
individual
let
me
in
liz
said
he
in
a
thick
voice
i
want
the
old
man
to
fork
over
some
money
i
cleaned
out
no
no
go
to
bed
george
she
answered
coaxingly
and
talk
to
him
about
it
in
the
morning
i
coming
in
said
he
determinedly
and
besides
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
that
nigger
garie
tell
us
in
the
morning
persisted
lizzy
no
i
going
to
tell
you
now
rejoined
he
forcing
his
way
into
the
room
it
too
good
to
keep
till
morning
pick
up
that
wick
let
a
fellow
see
if
you
are
all
alive
lizzie
raised
the
wick
of
the
lamp
in
accordance
with
his
desire
and
then
sat
down
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
and
vexation
on
her
countenance
george
threw
himself
into
an
easy
chair
and
began
i
saw
that
white
nigger
garie
he
was
in
company
with
a
gentleman
at
that
the
assurance
of
that
fellow
is
perfectly
incomprehensible
he
was
drinking
at
the
bar
of
the
hotel
and
as
it
is
no
secret
why
he
and
miss
bates
parted
i
enlightened
the
company
on
the
subject
of
his
antecedents
he
threatened
to
challenge
me
ho
ho
fight
with
a
nigger
that
is
too
good
a
joke
and
laughing
heartily
the
young
ruffian
leant
back
in
his
chair
i
want
some
money
dad
continued
he
i
say
old
gentleman
was
it
a
lucky
go
that
darkey
father
was
put
out
of
the
way
so
nicely
eh
we
been
living
in
clover
ever
since
have
we
how
dare
you
address
that
disrespectful
manner
go
out
of
the
room
sir
exclaimed
stevens
with
a
disturbed
countenance
come
george
go
to
bed
urged
his
sister
wearily
let
father
sleep
it
is
after
twelve
i
am
going
to
wake
the
nurse
and
then
retire
myself
george
rose
stupidly
from
his
chair
and
followed
his
sister
from
the
room
on
the
stairway
he
grasped
her
arm
rudely
and
said
i
do
understand
how
it
is
that
you
and
the
old
man
are
so
cursed
thick
all
of
a
sudden
you
are
thick
as
two
thieves
always
whispering
and
talking
together
act
fair
liz
do
persuade
him
to
leave
you
all
the
money
if
you
do
quarrel
that
flat
do
try
and
cozen
him
out
of
my
share
as
well
as
your
own
you
hear
oh
george
rejoined
she
reproachfully
i
never
had
such
an
idea
then
what
are
you
so
much
together
for
why
is
there
so
much
whispering
and
writing
and
going
off
on
journeys
all
alone
what
does
it
all
mean
eh
it
means
nothing
at
all
george
you
are
not
yourself
said
she
evasively
you
had
better
go
to
bed
it
is
that
are
not
yourself
he
retorted
what
makes
you
look
so
pale
and
worried
and
why
do
you
and
the
old
man
start
if
the
door
cracks
as
if
the
devil
was
after
you
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
asked
he
with
a
drunken
leer
you
had
better
look
out
concluded
he
i
watching
you
both
and
will
find
out
all
your
secrets
learn
all
our
secrets
ah
my
brother
thought
she
as
he
disappeared
into
his
room
you
need
not
desire
to
have
their
fearful
weight
upon
you
or
you
will
soon
grow
as
anxious
thin
and
pale
as
i
am
the
next
day
at
noon
lizzie
started
on
her
journey
after
a
short
conference
with
her
father
night
had
settled
upon
her
native
city
when
she
was
driven
through
its
straight
and
seemingly
interminable
thoroughfares
the
long
straight
rows
of
lamps
the
snowy
steps
the
scrupulously
clean
streets
the
signs
over
the
stores
were
like
the
faces
of
old
acquaintances
and
at
any
other
time
would
have
caused
agreeable
recollections
but
the
object
of
her
visit
her
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
any
other
and
more
pleasant
associations
she
ordered
the
coachman
to
take
her
to
an
obscure
hotel
and
after
having
engaged
a
room
she
left
her
baggage
and
started
in
search
of
the
residence
of
mccloskey
she
drew
her
veil
down
over
her
face
very
closely
and
walked
quickly
through
the
familiar
streets
until
she
arrived
at
the
place
indicated
in
his
letter
it
was
a
small
mean
tenement
in
a
by
street
in
which
there
were
but
one
or
two
other
houses
the
shutters
were
closed
from
the
upper
story
to
the
lowest
and
the
whole
place
wore
an
uninhabited
appearance
after
knocking
several
times
she
was
about
to
give
up
in
despair
when
she
discovered
through
the
glass
above
the
door
the
faint
glimmer
of
a
light
and
shortly
after
a
female
voice
demanded
from
the
inside
who
is
there
does
mccloskey
live
here
asked
lizzie
hearing
a
voice
not
more
formidable
than
her
own
the
person
within
partially
opened
the
door
and
whilst
shading
with
one
hand
the
candle
she
held
in
the
other
gazed
out
upon
the
speaker
does
mccloskey
live
here
repeated
lizzie
yes
he
does
answered
the
woman
in
a
weak
voice
but
he
got
the
typers
has
the
what
inquired
lizzie
who
did
not
exactly
understand
her
got
the
typers
got
the
fever
you
know
the
typhus
fever
said
lizzie
with
a
start
then
he
is
really
sick
really
sick
repeated
the
woman
really
sick
well
i
should
think
he
was
why
he
been
a
raving
and
swearing
awful
for
days
he
stormed
and
screamed
so
loud
that
the
neighbours
complained
law
they
had
to
even
shave
his
head
is
he
any
better
asked
lizzie
with
a
sinking
heart
can
i
see
him
you
can
if
you
go
to
the
hospital
but
whether
find
him
living
or
dead
is
more
than
i
can
say
i
could
keep
him
here
i
was
able
to
stand
him
i
had
the
fever
myself
he
took
it
from
me
you
must
come
in
continued
the
woman
if
you
want
to
talk
i
afraid
of
catching
cold
and
ca
stand
at
the
door
maybe
you
afraid
of
the
fever
she
further
observed
as
she
saw
lizzie
hesitate
on
the
oh
no
i
not
afraid
of
that
answered
lizzie
quickly
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
come
in
then
reiterated
the
woman
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
the
woman
looked
harmless
enough
and
lizzie
hesitated
no
longer
but
followed
her
through
the
entry
into
a
decently
furnished
room
setting
the
candlestick
upon
the
mantelpiece
she
offered
her
visitor
a
chair
and
then
continued
he
came
home
this
last
time
in
an
awful
state
before
he
left
some
one
sent
him
a
load
of
money
and
he
did
nothing
but
drink
and
gamble
whilst
it
lasted
i
used
to
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
take
care
of
his
money
and
he
snap
his
fingers
and
laugh
he
used
to
say
that
he
owned
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
and
could
have
money
whenever
he
wanted
it
well
as
i
was
a
saying
he
went
and
when
he
came
back
he
had
an
awful
attack
of
and
then
he
took
the
typers
oh
laws
mercy
continued
she
holding
up
her
bony
hands
how
that
critter
raved
he
talked
about
killing
people
he
did
interrupted
lizzie
with
a
gesture
of
alarm
and
laying
her
hand
upon
her
heart
which
beat
fearfully
did
he
mention
any
name
the
woman
did
not
stop
to
answer
this
question
but
proceeded
as
if
she
had
not
been
interrupted
he
was
always
going
on
about
two
orphans
and
a
will
and
he
used
to
curse
and
swear
awfully
about
being
obliged
to
keep
something
hid
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
to
it
would
almost
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
to
hear
him
and
he
never
mentioned
names
said
lizzie
inquiringly
no
that
was
so
strange
he
never
mentioned
no
names
he
used
to
rave
a
great
deal
about
two
orphans
and
a
will
and
he
would
ransack
the
bed
and
pull
up
the
sheets
and
look
under
the
pillows
as
if
he
thought
it
was
there
oh
he
acted
very
strange
but
never
mentioned
no
names
i
used
to
think
he
had
something
in
his
trunk
he
was
so
very
special
about
it
he
was
better
the
day
they
took
him
off
and
the
trunk
went
with
him
he
would
have
it
but
since
then
he
had
a
dreadful
relapse
and
there
no
knowin
whether
he
is
alive
or
dead
i
must
go
to
the
hospital
said
lizzie
rising
from
her
seat
and
greatly
relieved
to
learn
that
nothing
of
importance
had
fallen
from
mccloskey
during
his
delirium
i
shall
go
there
as
quickly
as
i
can
she
observed
walking
to
the
door
you
not
see
him
if
you
do
rejoined
the
woman
are
you
a
relation
oh
no
answered
lizzie
my
father
is
an
acquaintance
of
his
i
learned
that
he
was
ill
and
came
to
inquire
after
him
had
the
woman
not
been
very
indifferent
or
unobservant
she
would
have
noticed
the
striking
difference
between
the
manner
and
appearance
of
lizzie
stevens
and
the
class
who
generally
came
to
see
mccloskey
she
did
not
however
appear
to
observe
it
nor
did
she
manifest
any
curiosity
greater
than
that
evidenced
by
her
inquiring
if
he
was
a
relative
lizzie
walked
with
a
lonely
feeling
through
the
quiet
streets
until
she
arrived
at
the
porter
lodge
of
the
hospital
she
pulled
the
bell
with
trembling
hands
and
the
door
was
opened
by
the
little
man
whose
loquacity
was
once
the
reader
will
remember
so
painful
to
ellis
there
was
no
perceptible
change
in
his
appearance
and
he
manifestly
took
as
warm
an
interest
in
frightful
accidents
as
ever
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
asked
eagerly
as
lizzie
pale
face
became
visible
in
the
bright
light
that
shone
from
the
inner
office
do
you
want
a
stretcher
the
rapidity
with
which
he
asked
these
questions
and
his
eager
manner
quite
startled
her
and
she
was
for
a
moment
unable
to
tell
her
errand
speak
up
girl
speak
up
do
you
want
a
stretcher
is
it
burnt
or
run
over
ca
you
speak
eh
it
now
flashed
upon
lizzie
that
the
venerable
janitor
was
labouring
under
the
impression
that
she
had
come
to
make
application
for
the
admission
of
a
patient
and
she
quickly
answered
oh
no
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
i
am
glad
to
say
glad
to
say
muttered
the
old
man
the
eager
expectant
look
disappearing
from
his
face
giving
place
to
one
of
disappointment
glad
to
say
why
there
has
been
an
accident
and
here
you
gone
and
rung
the
bell
and
brought
me
here
to
the
door
for
nothing
what
do
you
want
then
i
wish
to
inquire
after
a
person
who
is
here
what
his
number
gruffly
inquired
he
that
i
can
not
tell
answered
she
his
name
is
mccloskey
i
do
know
anything
about
him
could
tell
who
he
is
unless
i
go
all
over
the
books
we
do
know
people
by
their
names
here
come
in
the
morning
ten
and
do
never
ring
that
bell
again
concluded
he
sharply
unless
you
want
a
stretcher
ringing
the
bell
and
no
accident
and
grumbling
at
being
disturbed
for
nothing
he
abruptly
closed
the
door
in
lizzie
face
anxious
and
discomfited
she
wandered
back
to
her
hotel
and
after
drinking
a
weak
cup
of
tea
locked
her
and
retired
to
bed
there
she
lay
tossing
from
side
to
side
she
could
not
sleep
her
anxiety
respecting
her
father
safety
her
fears
lest
in
the
delirium
of
fever
mccloskey
should
discover
their
secret
kept
her
awake
far
into
the
night
and
the
city
clocks
struck
two
ere
she
fell
asleep
when
she
awoke
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
into
her
room
for
a
few
moments
she
could
not
realize
where
she
was
but
the
events
of
the
past
night
soon
came
freshly
to
her
looking
at
her
watch
she
remembered
that
she
was
to
go
to
the
hospital
at
ten
and
it
was
already
nine
her
wakefulness
the
previous
night
having
caused
her
to
sleep
much
later
than
her
usual
hour
dressing
herself
in
haste
she
hurried
down
to
breakfast
and
after
having
eaten
a
slight
meal
ordered
a
carriage
and
drove
to
the
hospital
the
janitor
was
in
his
accustomed
seat
and
nodded
smilingly
to
her
as
she
entered
he
beckoned
her
to
him
and
whispered
i
inquired
about
him
mccloskey
no
died
this
morning
at
two
and
forty
minutes
dead
echoed
lizzie
with
a
start
of
horror
yes
dead
repeated
he
with
a
complacent
look
any
relation
of
yours
want
an
order
for
the
body
lizzie
was
so
astounded
by
this
intelligence
that
she
could
not
reply
and
the
old
man
continued
mysteriously
came
to
before
he
died
wish
he
had
put
me
to
a
deal
of
trouble
sent
for
a
magistrate
then
for
a
minister
had
something
on
his
mind
could
die
without
telling
it
you
know
then
there
was
oaths
depositions
so
much
trouble
are
you
his
relation
want
an
order
for
the
body
oaths
magistrate
a
confession
no
doubt
thought
lizzie
her
limbs
trembled
she
was
so
overcome
with
terror
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
clinging
to
the
railing
of
the
desk
by
which
she
was
standing
for
support
she
asked
hesitatingly
he
had
something
to
confess
then
the
janitor
looked
at
her
for
a
few
moments
attentively
and
seemed
to
notice
for
the
first
time
her
ladylike
appearance
and
manners
a
sort
of
reserve
crept
over
him
at
the
conclusion
of
his
scrutiny
for
he
made
no
answer
to
her
question
but
simply
asked
with
more
formality
than
before
are
you
a
relation
do
you
want
an
order
for
the
body
ere
lizzie
could
answer
his
question
a
man
plainly
dressed
with
keen
grey
eyes
that
seemed
to
look
restlessly
about
in
every
corner
of
the
room
came
and
stood
beside
the
janitor
he
looked
at
lizzie
from
the
bow
on
the
top
of
her
bonnet
to
the
shoes
on
her
feet
it
was
not
a
stare
it
was
more
a
hasty
glance
and
yet
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
knew
every
item
of
her
dress
and
could
have
described
her
exactly
are
you
a
relative
of
this
person
he
asked
in
a
clear
sharp
voice
whilst
his
keen
eyes
seemed
to
be
piercing
her
through
in
search
of
the
truth
no
sir
she
answered
faintly
a
friend
then
i
presume
continued
he
respectfully
an
acquaintance
returned
she
the
man
paused
for
a
few
moments
then
taking
out
his
watch
looked
at
the
time
and
hastened
from
the
office
this
man
possessed
lizzie
with
a
singular
feeling
of
dread
why
she
could
not
determine
yet
after
he
was
gone
she
imagined
those
cold
grey
eyes
were
resting
on
her
and
bidding
the
old
janitor
who
had
grown
reserved
so
suddenly
good
morning
she
sprang
into
her
carriage
as
fast
as
her
trembling
limbs
could
carry
her
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
back
to
the
hotel
father
must
fly
soliloquized
she
the
alarm
will
no
doubt
lend
him
energy
i
heard
of
people
who
have
not
been
able
to
leave
their
rooms
for
months
becoming
suddenly
strong
under
the
influence
of
terror
we
must
be
off
to
some
place
of
concealment
until
we
can
learn
whether
he
is
compromised
by
that
wretched
man
confession
lizzie
quickly
paid
her
bill
packed
her
trunk
and
started
for
the
station
in
hopes
of
catching
the
train
for
new
york
the
driver
did
not
spare
his
horses
but
at
her
request
drove
them
at
their
utmost
speed
but
in
vain
she
arrived
there
only
time
enough
to
see
the
train
move
away
and
there
standing
on
the
platform
looking
at
her
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
satisfaction
was
the
man
with
the
keen
grey
eyes
stop
stop
cried
she
too
late
miss
said
a
bystander
sympathizingly
just
too
late
no
other
train
for
three
hours
three
hours
said
lizzie
despairingly
three
hours
yet
i
must
be
patient
there
is
no
remedy
and
she
endeavoured
to
banish
her
fears
and
occupy
herself
in
reading
the
advertisements
that
were
posted
up
about
the
station
it
was
of
no
avail
that
man
with
his
piercing
grey
eyes
haunted
her
and
she
could
not
avoid
associating
him
in
her
thoughts
with
her
father
and
mccloskey
what
was
he
doing
on
the
train
and
why
did
he
regard
her
with
that
look
of
triumphant
satisfaction
those
were
to
her
the
three
longest
hours
of
her
life
wearily
and
impatiently
she
paced
up
and
down
the
long
saloon
watching
the
hands
of
the
clock
as
they
appeared
to
almost
creep
over
the
twenty
times
during
those
three
hours
did
she
compare
the
clock
with
her
watch
and
found
they
moved
on
unvaryingly
together
at
last
the
hour
for
the
departure
of
the
train
arrived
and
seated
in
the
car
she
was
soon
flying
at
express
speed
on
the
way
towards
her
home
how
much
sooner
does
the
other
train
arrive
than
we
she
asked
of
the
conductor
two
hours
and
a
half
miss
replied
he
courteously
we
gain
a
upon
them
a
that
is
something
gained
thought
she
i
may
reach
my
father
before
that
man
can
he
be
what
i
suspect
on
they
went
thirty
forty
fifty
miles
an
hour
yet
she
thought
it
slow
dashing
by
villages
through
meadows
over
bridges
rattling
screaming
puffing
on
their
way
to
the
city
of
new
york
in
due
time
they
arrived
at
the
ferry
and
after
crossing
the
river
were
in
the
city
itself
lizzie
took
the
first
carriage
that
came
to
hand
and
was
soon
going
briskly
through
the
streets
towards
her
father
house
the
nearer
she
approached
it
the
greater
grew
her
fears
a
horrible
presentiment
that
something
awful
had
occurred
grew
stronger
and
stronger
as
she
drew
nearer
home
she
tried
to
brave
it
off
resist
it
crush
it
but
it
came
back
upon
her
each
time
with
redoubled
force
on
she
went
nearer
and
nearer
every
moment
until
at
last
she
was
in
the
avenue
itself
she
gazed
eagerly
from
the
carriage
and
thought
she
observed
one
or
two
persons
run
across
the
street
opposite
her
house
it
could
not
be
she
looked
again
yes
there
was
a
group
beneath
his
window
faster
faster
she
cried
frantically
faster
if
you
can
the
door
was
at
last
reached
she
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
pressed
through
the
little
knot
of
people
who
were
gathered
on
the
pavement
alas
her
presentiments
were
correct
there
lying
on
the
pavement
was
the
mangled
form
of
her
father
who
had
desperately
sprung
from
the
balcony
above
to
escape
arrest
from
the
man
with
the
keen
grey
eyes
who
with
the
warrant
in
his
hand
stood
contemplating
the
lifeless
body
father
father
cried
lizzie
in
an
anguished
voice
father
speak
once
too
late
too
late
the
spirit
had
passed
away
the
murderer
had
rushed
before
a
higher
tribunal
a
mightier
judge
into
the
presence
of
one
who
tempers
justice
with
mercy
chapter
xxxv
the
wedding
the
night
that
lizzie
stevens
arrived
in
philadelphia
was
the
one
decided
upon
for
the
marriage
of
emily
garie
and
charles
ellis
and
whilst
she
was
wandering
so
lonely
through
the
streets
of
one
part
of
the
city
a
scene
of
mirth
and
gaiety
was
transpiring
in
another
some
of
the
actors
in
which
would
be
made
more
happy
by
events
that
would
be
productive
of
great
sorrow
to
her
throughout
that
day
bustle
and
confusion
had
reigned
supreme
in
the
house
of
walters
caddy
who
had
been
there
since
the
break
of
day
had
taken
the
domestic
reins
entirely
from
the
hands
of
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
and
usurped
command
herself
quiet
esther
was
well
satisfied
to
yield
her
full
control
of
the
domestic
arrangements
for
the
festivities
and
caddy
was
nothing
loath
to
assume
them
she
entered
upon
the
discharge
of
her
duties
with
such
ardour
as
to
leave
no
doubt
upon
the
minds
of
the
parties
most
interested
but
that
they
would
be
thoroughly
performed
and
with
an
alacrity
too
that
positively
appalled
quiet
esther
servants
great
doubts
had
been
expressed
as
to
whether
caddy
could
successfully
sustain
the
combined
characters
of
de
and
bridesmaid
and
a
failure
had
been
prophesied
she
therefore
felt
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
prove
these
prognostications
unfounded
and
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
the
undertaking
on
the
whole
she
went
to
work
with
energy
and
seemed
determined
to
establish
the
fact
that
her
abilities
were
greatly
underrated
and
that
a
woman
could
accomplish
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
when
she
set
about
it
the
feelings
of
all
such
persons
about
the
establishment
of
walters
as
were
constitutionally
tired
received
that
day
divers
serious
shocks
at
the
hands
of
miss
caddy
who
seemed
endowed
with
a
singular
faculty
which
enabled
her
to
discover
just
what
people
did
not
want
to
do
and
of
setting
them
at
it
immediately
for
instance
jane
the
fat
girl
hated
going
upstairs
excessively
caddy
employed
her
in
bringing
down
glass
and
china
from
a
pantry
and
moreover
only
permitted
her
to
bring
a
small
quantity
at
a
time
which
rendered
a
number
of
trips
strictly
necessary
to
the
great
aggravation
and
serious
discomfort
of
the
fat
girl
in
question
on
the
other
hand
julia
the
slim
chambermaid
who
would
have
been
delighted
with
such
employment
and
who
would
have
undoubtedly
refreshed
herself
on
each
excursion
upstairs
with
a
lengthened
gaze
from
the
window
was
condemned
to
the
polishing
of
silver
and
dusting
of
plates
and
glass
in
an
obscure
back
pantry
which
contained
but
one
window
and
that
commanding
a
prospect
of
a
dead
wall
miss
caddy
felt
in
duty
bound
to
inspect
each
cake
look
over
the
wine
and
to
the
great
discomfiture
of
the
waiter
decant
it
herself
not
liking
to
expose
him
to
any
unnecessary
temptation
she
felt
too
all
the
more
inclined
to
assume
the
office
of
butler
from
the
fact
that
at
a
previous
party
of
her
sister
she
had
detected
this
same
gentleman
with
a
bottle
of
the
best
sherry
at
his
mouth
whilst
he
held
his
head
thrown
back
in
a
most
surprising
manner
with
a
view
no
doubt
of
contemplating
the
ceiling
more
effectually
from
that
position
before
night
such
was
the
increasing
demand
for
help
in
the
kitchen
that
caddy
even
kidnapped
the
nurse
and
locked
the
brown
baby
and
her
sister
in
the
where
there
was
no
window
in
their
reach
nor
any
other
means
at
hand
from
which
the
slightest
injury
could
result
to
them
here
they
were
supplied
with
a
tub
half
filled
with
water
and
spent
the
time
most
delightfully
in
making
boats
of
their
shoes
and
lading
them
with
small
pieces
of
soap
which
they
bit
off
from
the
cake
for
the
occasion
then
coasting
along
to
the
small
towns
on
the
borders
of
the
tub
they
disposed
of
their
cargoes
to
imaginary
customers
to
immense
advantage
walters
had
declared
the
house
uninhabitable
and
had
gone
out
for
the
day
esther
and
emily
busied
themselves
in
arranging
the
flowers
in
the
and
hall
and
hanging
amidst
the
plants
on
the
balcony
little
stained
glass
lamps
all
of
which
caddy
thought
very
well
in
its
way
but
which
she
was
quite
confident
would
be
noticed
much
less
by
the
guests
than
the
supper
in
which
supposition
she
was
undoubtedly
correct
kinch
also
lounged
in
two
or
three
times
during
the
day
to
seek
consolation
at
the
hands
of
esther
and
emily
he
was
in
deep
distress
of
mind
in
great
perturbation
his
tailor
had
promised
to
send
home
a
vest
the
evening
previous
and
had
not
fulfilled
his
agreement
after
his
first
visit
kinch
entered
the
house
in
the
most
stealthy
manner
for
fear
of
being
encountered
by
caddy
who
having
met
him
in
the
hall
during
the
morning
posted
him
off
for
twenty
pounds
of
sugar
a
ball
of
twine
and
a
stone
jar
despite
his
declaration
of
haste
and
limited
knowledge
of
the
articles
in
question
whilst
lizzie
stevens
was
tremblingly
ringing
the
bell
at
the
lodge
of
the
hospital
busy
hands
were
also
pulling
at
that
of
walters
dwelling
carriage
after
carriage
rolled
up
and
deposited
their
loads
of
gay
company
who
skipped
nimbly
over
the
carpet
that
was
laid
down
from
the
door
to
the
curbstone
through
the
wide
hall
and
up
the
stairway
flowers
of
various
kinds
mingled
their
fragrance
and
loaded
the
air
with
their
rich
perfume
and
expressions
of
delight
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
guests
as
they
passed
up
the
stairway
and
thronged
the
spacious
there
were
but
few
whites
amongst
them
and
they
particular
friends
there
was
bird
who
had
travelled
from
warmouth
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
balch
the
friend
and
legal
adviser
of
the
bride
father
father
banks
who
was
to
tie
the
happy
knot
and
there
too
was
burrell
and
that
baby
now
grown
to
a
promising
lad
and
who
would
come
to
the
wedding
because
charlie
had
sent
him
a
regular
invitation
written
like
that
sent
his
parents
and
ellis
were
of
course
there
the
latter
arrayed
in
a
rich
new
silk
made
up
expressly
for
the
occasion
and
the
former
almost
hidden
in
his
large
easy
chair
the
poor
old
gentleman
scarcely
seemed
able
to
comprehend
the
affair
and
apparently
laboured
under
the
impression
that
it
was
another
mob
and
looked
a
little
terrified
at
times
when
the
laughter
or
conversation
grew
louder
than
usual
the
hour
for
the
ceremony
was
fast
approaching
and
esther
left
the
assembled
guests
and
went
up
into
emily
garie
room
to
assist
the
young
ladies
in
preparing
the
bride
they
all
besought
her
to
be
calm
not
to
agitate
herself
upon
any
consideration
and
then
bustled
about
her
and
flurried
themselves
in
the
most
ridiculous
manner
with
a
view
no
doubt
of
tranquillizing
her
feelings
more
effectually
little
em
soon
to
be
ellis
was
busily
engaged
in
dressing
the
was
covered
with
lighted
candles
and
all
the
in
the
room
were
in
full
blaze
bringing
everything
out
in
bold
relief
we
are
having
quite
an
illumination
the
glare
almost
blinds
me
said
emily
put
out
some
of
the
candles
no
no
my
dear
rejoined
one
of
the
young
ladies
engaged
in
dressing
her
we
can
not
sacrifice
a
candle
we
do
need
them
to
discern
your
charms
em
only
to
enable
us
to
discover
how
to
deck
them
to
the
best
advantage
how
sweet
you
look
emily
gazed
into
the
mirror
and
from
the
blush
that
suffused
her
face
and
the
look
of
complacency
that
followed
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
shared
her
friend
opinion
she
did
indeed
look
charming
there
was
a
deeper
colour
than
usual
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
illumined
with
a
soft
tender
light
her
wavy
brown
hair
was
parted
smoothly
on
the
front
and
gathered
into
a
cluster
of
curls
at
the
back
around
her
neck
glistened
a
string
of
pearls
a
present
from
winston
who
had
just
returned
from
south
america
the
pure
white
silk
fitted
to
a
nicety
and
the
tiny
satin
slippers
seemed
as
if
they
were
made
upon
her
feet
and
never
intended
to
come
off
again
her
costume
was
complete
with
the
exception
of
the
veil
and
wreath
and
esther
opened
the
box
that
she
supposed
contained
them
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
them
on
the
bride
where
have
you
put
the
veil
my
dear
she
asked
after
raising
the
lid
of
the
box
and
discovering
that
they
were
not
there
in
the
box
are
they
not
answered
one
of
the
young
ladies
no
they
are
not
there
continued
esther
as
she
turned
over
the
various
articles
with
which
the
tables
were
strewed
all
in
vain
the
veil
and
wreath
could
be
nowhere
discovered
are
you
sure
it
came
home
asked
one
of
course
replied
another
i
had
it
in
my
hand
an
hour
ago
then
a
thorough
search
was
commenced
all
the
drawers
ransacked
and
everything
turned
over
again
and
again
and
just
when
they
were
about
to
abandon
the
search
in
despair
one
of
the
party
returned
from
the
adjoining
room
dragging
along
the
brown
baby
who
had
the
veil
wrapped
about
her
chubby
shoulders
as
a
scarf
and
the
wreath
ornamenting
her
round
curly
head
even
esther
was
a
little
ruffled
at
this
daring
act
of
baby
and
hastily
divested
that
young
lady
of
her
borrowed
adornments
amidst
the
laughter
of
the
group
poor
baby
was
quite
astonished
at
the
precipitate
manner
in
which
she
was
deprived
of
her
finery
and
was
for
a
few
moments
quite
overpowered
by
her
loss
but
perceiving
a
drawer
open
in
the
she
dried
her
eyes
and
turned
her
attention
in
that
direction
and
in
tossing
its
contents
upon
the
floor
amply
solaced
herself
for
the
deprivation
she
had
just
undergone

kinch
soon
made
his
appearance
in
accordance
with
esther
request
and
fairly
dazzled
her
with
his
costume
his
blue
coat
was
brazen
with
buttons
and
his
white
cravat
tied
with
choking
exactness
spotless
vest
black
pants
and
such
patent
leathers
as
you
could
have
seen
your
face
in
with
ease
how
fine
you

kinch
said
esther
admiringly
yes

answered

new
vest

but
kinch

and
implore

slipping
away
very
fast

kinch
with
a
look
of
alarm
i

down
now
that

to
the
if
i

a
pile
of
dishes
or
something
of
the
kind
i
like
to
oblige
you
walters
but
it
worth
my
new
suit
to
do
it
under
these
circumstances
kinch
was
excused
and
a
deputation
headed
by
walters
was
sent
into
the
lower
regions
to
wait
upon
caddy
who
prevailed
upon
her
to
come
up
and
dress
which
she
did
being
all
the
while
very
red
in
the
face
and
highly
indignant
at
being
sent
for
so
often
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
what
a
pucker
you
are
all
in
why
caddy
it
time
to
be
replied
esther
it
wants
eight
minutes
of
the
hour
and
that
is
just
three
minutes
more
than
i
should
want
for
dressing
if
i
was
going
to
be
married
myself
rejoined
she
and
hastening
away
she
returned
in
an
incredibly
short
time
all
prepared
for
the
ceremony
charlie
was
very
handsomely
got
up
for
the
occasion
emily
esther
caddy
in
fact
all
of
them
agreed
that
he
never
looked
better
in
his
life
that
is
owing
to
me
all
my
doings
said
kinch
exultingly
he
wanted
to
order
his
suit
of
old
forbes
who
has
looked
at
a
for
the
last
ten
years
and
i
would
let
him
i
took
him
to
my
man
and
see
what
he
has
made
of
him
turned
him
out
looking
like
a
bridegroom
instead
of
an
old
man
of
fifty
it
all
owing
to
me
said
the
delighted
kinch
who
skipped
about
the
entry
until
he
upset
a
vase
of
flowers
that
stood
on
a
bracket
behind
him
whereupon
caddy
ran
and
brought
a
towel
and
made
him
take
off
his
white
gloves
and
wipe
up
the
water
in
spite
of
his
protestations
that
the
shape
of
his
pantaloons
would
not
bear
the
strain
of
stooping
at
last
the
hour
arrived
and
the
bridal
party
descended
to
the
in
appropriate
order
and
stood
up
before
father
banks
the
ceremony
was
soon
over
and
emily
was
clasped
in
ellis
arms
who
called
her
daughter
and
kissed
her
cheek
with
such
warm
affection
that
she
no
longer
felt
herself
an
orphan
and
paid
back
with
tears
and
embraces
the
endearments
that
were
lavished
upon
her
by
her
new
relatives
father
banks
took
an
early
opportunity
to
give
them
each
some
good
advice
and
managed
to
draw
them
apart
for
that
purpose
he
told
them
how
imperfect
and
faulty
were
all
mankind
that
married
life
was
not
all
de
that
the
trials
and
cares
incident
to
matrimony
fully
equalled
its
pleasures
and
besought
them
to
bear
with
each
other
patiently
to
be
charitable
to
each
other
faults
and
a
reasonable
share
of
earthly
happiness
must
be
the
result
then
came
the
supper
oh
such
a
supper
such
quantities
of
nice
things
as
money
and
skill
alone
can
bring
together
there
were
turkeys
innocent
of
a
bone
into
which
you
might
plunge
your
knife
to
the
very
hilt
without
coming
in
contact
with
a
splinter
turkeys
from
which
cunning
cooks
had
extracted
every
bone
leaving
the
meat
alone
behind
with
the
skin
not
perceptibly
broken
how
brown
and
tempting
they
looked
their
capacious
bosoms
giving
rich
promise
of
dressing
within
and
looking
larger
by
comparison
with
the
tiny
beside
them
which
lay
cosily
on
the
golden
toast
looking
as
much
as
to
say
if
you
want
something
to
remember
for
ever
come
and
give
me
a
bite
then
there
were
dishes
of
stewed
terrapin
into
which
the
initiated
dipped
at
once
and
to
which
they
for
some
time
gave
their
undivided
attention
oblivious
apparently
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
dish
of
close
beside
them
then
there
were
oysters
in
every
variety
silver
dishes
containing
them
stewed
their
fragrant
macey
odour
wafting
itself
upward
and
causing
watery
sensations
about
the
mouth
waiters
were
constantly
rushing
into
the
room
bringing
dishes
of
them
fried
so
richly
brown
so
smoking
hot
that
no
man
with
a
heart
in
his
bosom
could
possibly
refuse
them
then
there
were
glass
dishes
of
them
pickled
with
little
black
spots
of
allspice
floating
on
the
pearly
liquid
that
contained
them
and
lastly
oysters
broiled
whose
delicious
flavour
exceeds
my
powers
of
description
these
with
ham
and
tongue
were
the
solid
comforts
there
were
other
things
however
to
which
one
could
turn
when
the
appetite
grew
more
dainty
there
were
jellies
blancmange
chocolate
cream
biscuit
glace
peach
ice
vanilla
ice
ice
brandy
peaches
preserved
strawberries
and
pines
not
to
say
a
word
of
towers
of
candy
bonbons
kisses
champagne
rhine
wine
sparkling
catawba
liquors
and
a
man
in
the
corner
making
sherry
cobblers
of
wondrous
flavour
under
the
especial
supervision
of
kinch
on
the
whole
it
was
an
american
supper
got
up
regardless
of
expense
and
whoever
has
been
to
such
an
entertainment
knows
very
well
what
an
american
supper
is
what
a
merry
happy
party
it
was
how
they
all
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
and
how
they
all
laughed
when
the
bride
essayed
to
cut
the
cake
and
could
not
get
the
knife
through
the
icing
and
how
the
young
girls
put
pieces
away
privately
that
they
might
place
them
under
their
pillows
to
dream
upon
what
a
happy
time
they
had
father
banks
enjoyed
himself
amazingly
he
eat
quantities
of
stewed
terrapin
and
declared
it
the
best
he
ever
tasted
he
talked
gravely
to
the
old
people
cheerfully
and
amusingly
to
the
young
and
was
in
fact
having
a
most
delightful
time
when
a
servant
whispered
to
him
that
there
was
a
person
in
the
entry
who
wished
to
see
him
immediately
oh
dear
he
exclaimed
to
balch
i
was
just
congratulating
myself
that
i
should
have
one
uninterrupted
evening
and
you
see
the
result
called
off
at
this
late
hour
father
banks
followed
the
servant
from
the
room
and
inquired
of
the
messenger
what
was
wanted
you
must
come
to
the
hospital
immediately
sir
the
man
with
the
you
saw
him
yesterday
he
dying
he
says
he
must
see
you
that
he
has
something
important
to
confess
i
to
go
for
a
magistrate
as
well
ah
said
father
banks
you
need
go
no
further
alderman
balch
is
here
he
is
quite
competent
to
receive
his
depositions
i
heartily
glad
of
it
replied
the
man
it
will
save
me
another
hunt
i
had
a
hard
time
finding
you
i
been
to
your
house
and
two
or
three
other
places
and
was
at
last
sent
here
i
go
back
and
report
that
you
are
coming
and
will
bring
a
magistrate
with
you
very
good
rejoined
father
banks
do
so
i
will
be
there
immediately
hastening
back
to
the
supper
room
he
discovered
balch
in
the
act
of
helping
himself
to
a
brandy
peach
and
apprised
him
of
the
demand
for
his
services
now
banks
said
he
that
is
outrageous
why
did
you
not
let
him
go
for
some
one
else
it
is
too
bad
to
drag
me
away
just
when
the
fun
is
about
to
commence
there
was
no
alternative
however
and
balch
prepared
to
follow
the
minister
to
the
bedside
of
mccloskey
when
they
arrived
at
the
hospital
they
found
him
fast
sinking
the
livid
colour
of
his
face
the
sunken
glassy
eyes
the
white
lips
and
the
blue
tint
that
surrounded
the
eyes
and
mouth
told
at
once
the
fearful
story
death
had
come
he
was
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
and
told
them
all
how
stevens
had
saved
him
from
the
gallows
and
how
he
agreed
to
murder
garie
of
his
failure
when
the
time
of
action
arrived
and
how
in
consequence
stevens
had
committed
the
deed
and
how
he
had
paid
him
time
after
time
to
keep
his
secret
in
my
trunk
there
said
he
in
a
dying
whisper
in
my
trunk
is
the
will
i
found
it
that
night
amongst
his
papers
i
kept
it
to
get
money
out
of
his
children
with
when
old
stevens
was
gone
here
continued
he
handing
his
key
from
beneath
the
pillow
open
my
trunk
and
get
it
balch
eagerly
unlocked
the
trunk
and
there
sure
enough
lay
the
and
important
document
i
knew
it
would
be
found
at
last
i
always
told
walters
so
and
now
said
he
exultingly
see
my
predictions
are
verified
mccloskey
seemed
anxious
to
atone
for
the
past
by
making
an
ample
confession
he
told
them
all
he
knew
of
stevens
present
circumstances
how
his
property
was
situated
and
every
detail
necessary
for
their
guidance
then
his
confession
was
sworn
to
and
witnessed
and
the
dying
man
addressed
himself
to
the
affairs
of
the
next
world
and
endeavoured
to
banish
entirely
from
his
mind
all
thoughts
of
this
after
a
life
passed
in
the
exercise
of
every
christian
virtue
after
a
lengthened
journey
over
its
narrow
stony
pathway
whereon
temptations
have
been
met
and
triumphed
over
where
we
have
struggled
with
difficulties
and
borne
afflictions
without
murmur
or
complaint
cheering
on
the
weary
we
have
found
sinking
by
the
wayside
comforting
and
assisting
the
fallen
endeavouring
humbly
and
faithfully
to
do
our
duty
to
god
and
humanity
even
after
a
life
thus
passed
when
we
at
last
lie
down
to
die
the
most
faithful
and
best
may
well
shrink
and
tremble
when
they
approach
the
gloomy
portals
of
death
at
such
an
hour
memory
more
active
than
every
other
faculty
drags
all
the
good
and
evil
from
the
past
and
sets
them
in
distinct
array
before
us
then
we
discover
how
greatly
the
latter
exceeds
the
former
in
our
lives
and
how
little
of
our
father
work
we
have
accomplished
after
all
our
toils
and
struggles
is
then
the
most
devoted
servant
of
our
common
master
feels
compelled
to
cry
mercy
o
my
father
for
justice
i
dare
not
ask
if
thus
the
christian
passes
away
what
terror
must
fill
the
breast
of
one
whose
whole
life
has
been
a
constant
warfare
upon
the
laws
of
god
and
man
how
approaches
he
the
bar
of
that
awful
judge
whose
commands
he
has
set
at
nought
and
whose
power
he
has
so
often
contemned
with
a
fainting
heart
and
tongue
powerless
to
crave
the
mercy
his
crimes
can
not
deserve
mccloskey
struggled
long
with
death
died
fearfully
hard
the
phantoms
of
his
victims
seemed
to
haunt
him
in
his
dying
hour
interposing
between
him
and
god
and
with
distorted
face
clenched
hands
and
gnashing
teeth
he
passed
away
to
his
long
account
from
the
bedside
of
the
corpse
balch
went
late
as
it
was
to
the
office
of
the
chief
of
police
there
he
learned
to
his
great
satisfaction
that
the
governor
was
in
town
and
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
he
procured
a
requisition
for
the
arrest
of
stevens
which
he
put
into
the
hands
of
the
man
with
the
keen
grey
eyes
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
criminal
and
with
the
result
of
his
efforts
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
chapter
xxxvi
and
the
last
with
such
celerity
did
balch
work
in
behalf
of
his
wards
that
he
soon
had
everything
in
train
for
the
recovery
of
the
property
at
first
george
stevens
was
inclined
to
oppose
the
execution
of
the
will
but
he
was
finally
prevailed
upon
by
his
advisers
to
make
no
difficulty
respecting
it
and
quietly
resign
what
he
must
inevitably
sooner
or
later
relinquish
lizzie
stevens
on
the
contrary
seemed
rather
glad
that
an
opportunity
was
afforded
to
do
justice
to
her
old
playmates
and
won
the
good
opinion
of
all
parties
by
her
gentleness
and
evident
anxiety
to
atone
for
the
wrong
done
them
by
her
father
even
after
the
demands
of
the
executors
of
garie
were
fully
satisfied
such
had
been
the
thrift
of
her
father
that
there
still
remained
a
comfortable
support
for
her
and
her
brother
to
poor
clarence
this
accession
of
fortune
brought
no
new
pleasure
he
already
had
sufficient
for
his
modest
wants
and
now
that
his
greatest
hope
in
life
had
been
blighted
this
addition
of
wealth
became
to
him
rather
a
burden
than
a
pleasure
he
was
now
completely
excluded
from
the
society
in
which
he
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
move
the
secret
of
his
birth
had
become
widely
known
and
he
was
avoided
by
his
former
friends
and
sneered
at
as
a
nigger
his
large
fortune
kept
some
two
or
three
whites
about
him
but
he
knew
they
were
leeches
seeking
to
bleed
his
purse
and
he
wisely
avoided
their
society
he
was
very
wretched
and
lonely
he
felt
ashamed
to
seek
the
society
of
coloured
men
now
that
the
whites
despised
and
rejected
him
so
he
lived
apart
from
both
classes
of
society
and
grew
moody
and
misanthropic
balch
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
go
abroad
to
visit
europe
he
would
not
he
did
not
confess
it
but
the
truth
was
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
the
city
where
little
birdie
dwelt
where
he
now
and
then
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
to
solace
him
in
his
loneliness
he
was
growing
paler
and
more
each
day
and
the
doctor
at
last
frankly
told
him
that
if
he
desired
to
live
he
must
seek
some
warmer
climate
for
the
winter
reluctantly
clarence
obeyed
in
the
fall
he
left
new
york
and
during
the
cold
months
wandered
through
the
west
india
islands
for
a
while
his
health
improved
but
when
the
novelty
produced
by
change
of
scene
began
to
decline
he
grew
worse
again
and
brooded
more
deeply
than
ever
over
his
bitter
disappointment
and
consequently
derived
but
little
benefit
from
the
change
the
spirit
was
too
much
broken
for
the
body
to
mend
his
heart
was
too
sore
to
beat
healthily
or
happily
he
wrote
often
now
to
emily
and
her
husband
and
seemed
desirous
to
atone
for
his
past
neglect
emily
had
written
to
him
first
she
had
learned
of
his
disappointment
and
gave
him
a
sister
sympathy
in
his
loneliness
and
sorrow
the
chilly
month
of
march
had
scarcely
passed
away
when
they
received
a
letter
from
him
informing
them
of
his
intention
to
return
he
wrote
i
am
no
better
and
my
physician
says
that
a
longer
residence
here
will
not
benefit
me
in
the
least
that
i
came
i
cough
cough
cough
incessantly
and
each
day
become
more
feeble
i
am
coming
home
emmy
coming
home
i
fear
to
die
i
am
but
a
ghost
of
my
former
self
i
write
you
this
that
you
may
not
be
alarmed
when
you
see
me
it
is
too
late
now
to
repine
but
oh
em
if
my
lot
had
only
been
cast
with
yours
had
we
never
been
separated
i
might
have
been
as
happy
as
you
are
it
was
a
clear
bright
morning
when
charlie
stepped
into
a
boat
to
be
conveyed
to
the
ship
in
which
clarence
had
returned
to
new
york
she
had
arrived
the
evening
previous
and
had
not
yet
come
up
to
the
dock
the
air
came
up
the
bay
fresh
and
invigorating
from
the
sea
beyond
and
the
water
sparkled
as
it
dripped
from
the
oars
which
with
monotonous
regularity
broke
the
almost
unruffled
surface
of
the
bay
some
of
the
ship
sails
were
shaken
out
to
dry
in
the
morning
sun
and
the
cordage
hung
loosely
and
carelessly
from
the
masts
and
yards
a
few
sailors
lounged
idly
about
the
deck
and
leaned
over
the
side
to
watch
the
boat
as
it
approached
with
their
aid
it
was
soon
secured
alongside
and
charlie
clambered
up
the
ladder
and
stood
upon
the
deck
of
the
vessel
on
inquiring
for
clarence
he
was
shown
into
the
cabin
where
he
found
him
extended
on
a
sofa
he
raised
himself
as
he
saw
charlie
approach
and
extending
his
hand
exclaimed
how
kind
i
did
not
expect
you
until
we
reached
the
shore
for
a
moment
charlie
could
not
speak
the
shock
caused
by
altered
appearance
was
too
great
the
change
was
terrible
when
he
had
last
seen
him
he
was
erect
and
healthful
now
he
was
bent
and
emaciated
to
a
frightful
extent
the
veins
on
his
temples
were
clearly
discernible
the
muscles
of
his
throat
seemed
like
great
cords
his
cheeks
were
hollow
his
sunken
eyes
were
glassy
bright
and
surrounded
with
a
dark
rim
and
his
breathing
was
short
and
evidently
painful
charlie
held
his
thin
fleshless
hand
in
his
own
and
gazed
in
his
face
with
an
anguished
expression
i
look
badly
do
i
charlie
said
he
with
assumed
indifference
worse
than
you
expected
eh
charlie
hesitated
a
little
and
then
answered
rather
bad
but
it
is
owing
to
your
i
suppose
that
has
probably
reduced
you
considerably
then
this
close
cabin
must
be
most
unfavourable
to
your
health
ah
wait
until
we
get
you
home
we
shall
soon
have
you
better
home
repeated
clarence
home
how
delightful
that
word
sounds
i
feel
it
is
going
to
go
to
you
and
em
and
he
leant
back
and
repeated
the
word
home
and
paused
afterward
as
one
touches
some
favourite
note
upon
an
instrument
and
then
silently
listens
to
its
vibrations
how
is
em
he
asked
at
length
oh
well
very
well
replied
charlie
she
has
been
busy
as
a
bee
ever
since
she
received
your
last
letter
such
a
charming
room
as
she
has
prepared
for
you
ah
charlie
rejoined
clarence
mournfully
i
shall
not
live
long
to
enjoy
it
i
fear
nonsense
interrupted
charlie
hopefully
do
be
so
desponding
clary
here
is
spring
again
everything
is
thriving
and
bursting
into
new
life
you
too
will
catch
the
spirit
of
the
season
and
grow
in
health
and
strength
again
why
my
dear
fellow
continued
he
cheerfully
you
help
getting
better
when
we
once
get
hold
of
you
mother
gruels
doctor
burdett
prescriptions
and
em
nursing
would
lift
a
man
out
of
his
coffin
come
now
do
let
us
hear
anything
more
about
dying
clarence
pressed
his
hand
and
looked
at
him
affectionately
as
though
he
appreciated
his
efforts
to
cheer
him
and
felt
thankful
for
them
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
smiled
mournfully
let
me
help
your
man
to
get
you
up
when
once
you
get
ashore
you
feel
better
i
no
doubt
we
are
not
going
to
an
hotel
but
to
the
house
of
a
friend
who
has
kindly
offered
to
make
you
comfortable
until
you
are
able
to
travel
with
the
assistance
of
charlie
and
the
servant
clarence
was
gradually
prepared
to
go
ashore
he
was
exceedingly
weak
could
scarcely
totter
across
the
deck
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
they
at
last
succeeded
in
placing
him
safely
in
the
boat
after
they
landed
a
carriage
was
soon
procured
and
in
a
short
time
thereafter
clarence
was
comfortably
established
in
the
house
of
charlie
friend
their
hostess
a
dear
old
motherly
creature
declared
that
she
knew
exactly
what
clarence
needed
and
concocted
such
delicious
broths
made
such
strengthening
gruels
that
clarence
could
not
avoid
eating
and
in
a
day
or
two
he
declared
himself
better
than
he
had
been
for
a
month
and
felt
quite
equal
to
the
journey
to
philadelphia
the
last
night
of
their
stay
in
new
york
was
unusually
warm
and
clarence
informed
charlie
he
wished
to
go
out
for
a
walk
i
wish
to
go
a
long
distance
do
think
me
foolish
when
i
tell
you
where
i
want
to
look
at
the
house
where
little
birdie
lives
it
may
be
for
the
last
time
i
have
a
presentiment
that
i
shall
see
her
if
i
go
i
am
sure
i
shall
added
he
positively
as
though
he
felt
a
conviction
that
his
desire
would
be
accomplished
i
would
not
clary
remonstrated
charlie
your
health
wo
permit
the
exertion
it
is
a
long
distance
too
you
say
and
moreover
do
you
think
my
dear
fellow
that
it
is
far
more
prudent
to
endeavour
if
possible
to
banish
her
from
your
mind
entirely
do
permit
yourself
to
think
about
her
if
you
can
help
it
you
know
she
is
unattainable
by
you
and
you
should
make
an
effort
to
conquer
your
attachment
it
is
too
late
too
late
now
charlie
he
replied
mournfully
i
shall
continue
to
love
her
as
i
do
now
until
i
draw
my
last
breath
i
know
it
is
hopeless
i
know
she
can
never
be
more
to
me
than
she
already
is
but
i
can
not
help
loving
her
let
us
go
i
may
see
her
once
again
ah
charlie
you
can
not
even
dream
what
inexpressible
pleasure
the
merest
glimpse
of
her
affords
me
come
let
us
go
charlie
would
not
permit
him
to
attempt
to
walk
and
they
procured
a
carriage
in
which
they
rode
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
house
the
mansion
of
bates
appeared
quite
gloomy
as
they
approached
it
the
blinds
were
down
and
no
lights
visible
in
any
part
of
the
house
i
am
afraid
they
are
out
of
town
remarked
charlie
when
clarence
pointed
out
the
house
everything
looks
so
dull
about
it
let
us
cross
over
to
the
other
pavement
and
they
walked
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
gazed
upward
at
the
house
let
us
sit
down
here
suggested
clarence
here
on
this
broad
stone
it
is
quite
dark
now
and
no
one
will
observe
us
no
no
remonstrated
charlie
the
stone
is
too
damp
and
cold
is
it
said
clarence
vacantly
and
taking
out
his
handkerchief
he
spread
it
out
and
in
spite
of
charlie
dissuasions
sat
down
upon
it
charlie
said
he
after
gazing
at
the
house
a
long
time
in
silence
i
have
often
come
here
and
remained
half
the
night
looking
at
her
windows
people
have
passed
by
and
stared
at
me
as
though
they
thought
me
crazy
i
was
half
crazy
then
i
think
one
night
i
remember
i
came
and
sat
here
for
hours
far
in
the
night
i
saw
her
come
to
the
window
throw
up
the
casement
and
look
out
that
was
in
the
summer
before
i
went
away
you
know
there
she
stood
in
the
moonlight
gazing
upward
at
the
sky
so
pale
so
calm
and
in
her
pure
white
dress
that
i
should
not
have
thought
it
strange
if
the
heavens
had
opened
and
angels
descended
and
borne
her
away
with
them
on
their
wings
and
clarence
closed
his
eyes
as
he
concluded
to
call
back
upon
the
mirror
of
his
mind
the
image
of
little
birdie
as
she
appeared
that
night
they
waited
a
long
while
during
which
there
was
no
evidence
exhibited
that
there
was
any
one
in
the
house
at
last
just
as
they
were
about
to
move
away
they
descried
the
glimmer
of
a
light
in
the
room
which
clarence
declared
to
be
her
room
his
frame
trembled
with
expectation
and
he
walked
to
and
fro
opposite
the
house
with
an
apparent
strength
that
surprised
his
companion
at
length
the
light
disappeared
again
and
with
it
hopes
now
then
we
must
go
said
charlie
it
is
useless
for
you
to
expose
yourself
in
this
manner
i
insist
upon
your
coming
home
reluctantly
clarence
permitted
himself
to
be
led
across
the
street
again
as
they
were
leaving
the
pavement
he
turned
to
look
back
again
and
uttering
a
cry
of
surprise
and
joy
he
startled
charlie
by
clutching
his
arm
look
look
he
cried
there
she
is
my
little
birdie
charlie
looked
up
at
the
window
almost
immediately
above
them
and
observed
a
slight
pale
girl
who
was
gazing
up
the
street
in
an
opposite
direction
little
birdie
little
birdie
whispered
clarence
tenderly
she
did
not
look
toward
them
but
after
standing
there
a
few
seconds
moved
from
between
the
curtains
and
disappeared
thank
god
for
that
exclaimed
clarence
passionately
i
knew
i
knew
i
should
see
her
knew
repeated
he
exultingly
and
then
overcome
with
joy
he
bowed
his
head
upon
charlie
shoulder
and
wept
like
a
child
do
think
me
foolish
charlie
apologized
he
i
can
not
help
it
i
will
go
home
now
oh
brother
i
feel
so
much
happier
and
with
a
step
less
faint
and
trembling
he
walked
back
to
the
carriage
the
following
evening
he
was
at
home
but
so
enfeebled
with
the
exertions
of
the
last
two
days
as
to
be
obliged
to
take
to
his
bed
immediately
after
his
arrival
his
sister
greeted
him
affectionately
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
tenderly
years
of
coldness
and
estrangement
were
forgotten
in
that
moment
and
they
were
once
more
to
each
other
as
they
were
before
they
parted
emily
tried
to
appear
as
though
she
did
not
notice
the
great
change
in
his
appearance
and
talked
cheerfully
and
encouragingly
in
his
presence
but
she
wept
bitterly
when
alone
over
the
final
separation
which
she
foresaw
was
not
far
distant
the
nest
day
doctor
burdett
called
and
his
grave
manner
and
apparent
disinclination
to
encourage
any
hope
confirmed
the
hopeless
impression
they
already
entertained
aunt
ada
came
from
sudbury
at
emily
request
she
knew
her
presence
would
give
pleasure
to
clarence
she
accordingly
wrote
her
to
come
and
she
and
emily
nursed
by
turns
the
failing
sufferer
esther
and
her
husband
ellis
and
caddy
and
even
kinch
were
unremitting
in
their
attentions
and
did
all
in
their
power
to
amuse
and
comfort
him
day
by
day
he
faded
perceptibly
grew
more
and
more
feeble
until
at
last
doctor
burdett
began
to
number
days
instead
of
weeks
as
his
term
of
life
clarence
anticipated
death
with
calmness
did
not
repine
or
murmur
father
banks
was
often
with
him
cheering
him
with
hopes
of
a
happier
future
beyond
the
grave
one
day
he
sent
for
his
sister
and
desired
her
to
write
a
letter
for
him
em
said
he
i
am
failing
fast
these
fiery
spots
on
my
cheek
this
scorching
in
my
palms
these
difficult
breaths
warn
me
that
the
time
is
very
near
do
weep
em
continued
he
kissing
her
there
do
weep
i
shall
be
better
off
happier
i
am
sure
do
weep
now
i
want
you
to
write
to
little
birdie
for
me
i
have
tried
but
my
hand
trembles
so
that
i
can
not
write
legibly
i
gave
it
up
sit
down
beside
me
here
and
write
here
is
the
pen
emily
dried
her
eyes
and
mechanically
sat
down
to
write
as
he
desired
motioning
to
him
that
she
was
ready
he
dictated
my
dear
little
birdie
i
once
resolved
never
to
write
to
you
again
and
partially
promised
your
father
that
i
would
not
then
i
did
not
dream
that
i
should
be
so
soon
compelled
to
break
my
resolution
little
birdie
i
am
dying
my
physician
informs
me
that
i
have
but
a
few
more
days
to
live
i
have
been
trying
to
break
away
from
earth
affairs
and
fix
my
thoughts
on
other
and
better
things
i
have
given
up
all
but
you
and
feel
that
i
can
not
relinquish
you
until
i
see
you
once
again
do
not
refuse
me
little
birdie
show
this
to
your
father
he
must
consent
to
a
request
made
by
one
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
there
that
will
do
let
me
read
it
over
said
he
extending
his
hand
for
the
note
yes
i
will
sign
it
now
then
do
you
add
our
address
send
it
now
emily
send
it
in
time
for
mail
clary
do
you
think
she
will
come
inquired
his
sister
yes
replied
he
confidently
i
am
sure
she
will
if
the
note
reaches
her
emily
said
no
more
but
sealed
and
directed
the
note
which
she
immediately
despatched
to
the
and
on
the
following
day
it
reached
little
birdie
from
the
time
when
the
secret
of
clarence
birth
had
been
discovered
until
the
day
she
had
received
his
note
she
never
mentioned
his
name
at
the
demand
of
her
father
she
produced
his
letters
miniature
and
even
the
little
presents
he
had
given
her
from
time
to
time
and
laid
them
down
before
him
without
a
murmur
after
this
even
when
he
cursed
and
denounced
him
she
only
left
the
room
never
uttering
a
word
in
his
defence
she
moved
about
like
one
who
had
received
a
stunning
blow
she
was
dull
cold
apathetic
she
would
smile
vacantly
when
her
father
smoothed
her
hair
or
kissed
her
cheek
but
she
never
laughed
or
sang
and
played
as
in
days
gone
by
she
would
recline
for
hours
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
gazing
vacantly
in
the
air
and
taking
apparently
no
interest
in
anything
about
her
she
bent
her
head
when
she
walked
complained
of
coldness
about
her
temples
and
kept
her
hand
constantly
upon
her
heart
doctors
were
at
last
consulted
they
pronounced
her
physically
well
and
thought
that
time
would
restore
her
wonted
animation
but
month
after
month
she
grew
more
dull
and
silent
until
her
father
feared
she
would
become
idiotic
and
grew
hopeless
and
unhappy
about
her
for
a
week
before
the
receipt
of
the
note
from
clarence
she
had
been
particularly
apathetic
and
indifferent
but
it
seemed
to
rouse
her
into
life
again
she
started
up
after
reading
it
and
rushed
wildly
through
the
hall
into
her
library
see
here
exclaimed
she
grasping
his
arm
see
there
i
knew
it
felt
day
after
day
that
it
was
coming
to
that
you
separated
us
and
now
he
is
dying
dying
cried
she
read
it
read
it
her
father
took
the
note
and
after
perusing
it
laid
it
on
the
table
and
said
coldly
well
well
repeated
she
with
agitation
oh
father
it
is
not
well
father
said
she
hurriedly
you
bid
me
give
him
up
told
me
he
was
unworthy
pointed
out
to
me
fully
and
clearly
why
we
could
not
marry
i
was
convinced
we
could
not
for
i
knew
you
would
never
let
it
be
yet
i
have
never
ceased
to
love
him
i
can
not
control
my
heart
but
i
could
my
voice
and
never
since
that
day
have
i
spoken
his
name
i
gave
him
up
not
that
i
would
not
have
gladly
married
knowing
what
he
was
because
you
desired
it
because
i
saw
either
your
heart
must
break
or
mine
i
let
mine
go
to
please
you
and
have
suffered
uncomplainingly
and
will
so
suffer
until
the
end
but
i
see
him
once
again
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
him
to
see
me
once
again
in
his
dying
hour
and
i
go
if
you
love
me
continued
she
pleadingly
as
her
father
made
a
gesture
of
dissent
let
us
go
you
see
he
is
dying
begs
you
from
the
brink
of
the
grave
let
me
go
only
to
say
good
bye
to
him
and
then
perhaps
concluded
she
pressing
her
hand
upon
her
heart

her
father
had
not
the
heart
to
make
any
objection
and
the
next
day
they
started
for
philadelphia
they
despatched
a
note
to
clarence
saying
they
had

which
emily
received
and
after

it
went
to
gently
break
its
contents
to
her
brother

he
joyfully

clarence
insisted
on
being
dressed
with
extraordinary
care
his
long
beard
was
trimmed
carefully
and
he
looked
much
better
than
he
had
done
for
weeks
he
was
wonderfully
stronger
walked
across
the
room
and
chatted
over
his
breakfast
with
unusual
animation
at
noon
they
came
and
were
shown
into
the
where
emily
received
them
bates
bowed
politely
and
expressed
a
hope
that
garie
was
better
emily
held
out
her
hand
to
little
birdie
who
clasped
it
in
both
her
own
and
said
inquiringly

his
sister
yes
answered
emily
you
i
should
have
known
from
description

are
his
little
birdie
she
did
not
reply
her
lip
quivered
and
she
pressed
emily
hand
and
kissed
her
he
is
impatient
to
see
you
resumed
emily
and
if
you
are
so
disposed
we
will
go
up
immediately
i
will
remain
here
observed
bates
unless
garie
particularly
desires
to
see
me
my
daughter
will
accompany
you
emily
took
the
hand
of
little
birdie
in
her
own
and
they
walked
together
up
the
stairway
you
must
not
be
frightened
at
his
appearance
she
remarked
tearfully
he
is
greatly
changed
little
birdie
only
shook
her
head
her
heart
seemed
too
full
for
speech
and
she
stepped
on
a
little
faster
keeping
her
hand
pressed
on
her
breast
all
the
while
when
they
reached
the
door
emily
was
about
to
open
it
but
her
companion
stopped
her
by
saying
wait
a
moment
stop
how
my
heart
beats
it
almost
suffocates
me
they
paused
for
a
few
moments
to
permit
little
birdie
to
recover
from
her
agitation
then
throwing
open
the
door
they
advanced
into
the
room
clarence
said
his
sister
he
did
not
answer
he
was
looking
down
into
the
garden
she
approached
nearer
and
gently
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
here
is
your
little
birdie
clarence
he
neither
moved
nor
spoke
clarence
cried
she
louder
no
answer
she
touched
his
face
it
was
warm
he
fainted
exclaimed
she
and
ringing
the
bell
violently
she
screamed
for
help
her
husband
and
the
nurse
rushed
into
the
room
then
came
aunt
ada
and
bates
they
bathed
his
temples
held
strong
salts
to
his
nostrils
still
he
did
not
revive
finally
the
nurse
opened
his
bosom
and
placed
her
hand
upon
his
heart
was
still
quite
clarence
was
dead
at
first
they
could
not
believe
it
let
me
speak
to
him
exclaimed
little
birdie
distractedly
he
will
hear
my
voice
and
answer
clarence
clarence
she
cried
all
in
vain
all
in
vain
clarence
was
dead
they
gently
bore
her
away
that
dull
cold
look
came
back
again
upon
her
face
and
left
it
never
more
in
life
she
walked
about
mournfully
for
a
few
years
pressing
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
then
passed
away
to
join
her
lover
where
distinctions
in
race
or
colour
are
unknown
and
where
the
prejudices
of
earth
can
not
mar
their
happiness
our
tale
is
now
soon
finished
they
buried
clarence
beside
his
parents
coloured
people
followed
him
to
his
last
home
and
wept
over
his
grave
of
all
the
many
whites
that
he
had
known
aunt
ada
and
balch
were
the
only
ones
that
mingled
their
tears
with
those
who
listened
to
the
solemn
words
of
father
banks
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
we
too
clarence
cast
a
tear
upon
thy
tomb
poor
victim
of
prejudice
to
thy
colour
and
deem
thee
better
off
resting
upon
thy
cold
pillow
of
earth
than
battling
with
that
malignant
sentiment
that
persecuted
thee
and
has
crushed
energy
hope
and
life
from
many
stronger
hearts
aunt
ada
bell
remained
for
a
short
time
with
emily
and
then
returned
to
sudbury
where
during
the
remainder
of
her
life
she
never
omitted
an
opportunity
of
doing
a
kindness
to
a
coloured
person
and
when
the
increasing
liberality
of
sentiment
opened
a
way
for
the
admission
of
coloured
pupils
to
the
famous
schools
of
sudbury
they
could
always
procure
board
at
her
house
and
aunt
ada
was
a
friend
and
mother
to
them
walters
and
dear
old
ess
reared
a
fine
family
and
the
brown
baby
and
her
sister
took
numberless
premiums
at
school
to
the
infinite
delight
of
their
parents
they
also
had
a
boy
whom
they
named
charlie
he
inherited
his
uncle
passionate
fondness
for
marbles
which
fondness
it
has
been
ascertained
is
fostered
by
his
uncle
who
is
said
furnishes
the
sinews
of
war
when
there
is
a
dearth
in
the
treasury
of
master
walters
kinch
and
caddy
were
finally
united
after
various
difficulties
raised
by
the
latter
who
found
it
almost
impossible
to
procure
a
house
in
such
a
state
of
order
as
would
warrant
her
entering
upon
the
blissful
state
of
matrimony
when
it
was
all
over
kinch
professed
to
his
acquaintances
generally
to
be
living
in
a
perfect
state
of
bliss
but
he
privately
intimated
to
charlie
that
if
caddy
would
permit
him
to
come
in
at
the
front
door
and
not
condemn
him
to
go
through
the
alley
whenever
there
happened
to
be
a
shower
and
would
let
him
smoke
where
he
liked
he
would
be
much
more
contented
when
last
heard
from
they
had
a
little
caddy
the
very
image
of
its
mother
a
wonderful
little
girl
who
instead
of
buying
candy
and
cake
with
her
sixpences
as
other
children
did
gravely
invested
them
in
miniature
and
and
was
saving
up
her
money
to
purchase
a
tiny
stove
with
a
full
set
of
cooking
utensils
caddy
declares
her
a
child
worth
having
charles
and
emily
took
a
voyage
to
europe
for
the
health
of
the
latter
and
returned
after
a
two
years
tour
to
settle
permanently
in
his
native
city
they
were
unremitting
in
their
attention
to
father
and
mother
ellis
who
lived
to
good
old
age
surrounded
by
their
children
and
grandchildren
