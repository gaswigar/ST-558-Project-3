through
the

seen
an
avenue
of
old
trees
leading
to
a
courtyard
it
is
a
summer
evening
after
sunset
rebecca
west
is
sitting
by
the
window
crocheting
a
large
white
woollen
shawl
which
is
nearly
completed
from
time
to
time
she
peeps
out
of
window
through
the
flowers
helseth
comes
in
from
the
right
helseth
had
i
better
begin
and
lay
the
table
for
supper
miss
rebecca
yes
do
rosmer
ought
to
be
in
directly
helseth
is
there
a
draught
where
you
are
sitting
miss
rebecca
there
is
a
little
will
you
shut
up
please
helseth
goes
to
the
hall
door
and
shuts
it
then
she
goes
to
the
window
to
shut
it
and
looks
out
helseth
is
that
rosmer
coming
there
rebecca
where
gets
up
yes
it
is
he
stands
behind
the
stand
on
one
side
do
let
him
catch
sight
of
us
helseth
stepping
back
look
miss
he
is
beginning
to
use
the
mill
path
again
rebecca
he
came
by
the
mill
path
the
day
before
yesterday
too
peeps
out
between
the
curtain
and
the
now
we
shall
see
whether
helseth
is
he
going
over
the
wooden
bridge
rebecca
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
see
after
a
moment
no
he
has
turned
aside
he
is
coming
the
other
way
round
too
comes
away
from
the
window
it
is
a
long
way
round
helseth
yes
of
course
one
can
well
understand
his
shrinking
from
going
over
that
bridge
the
spot
where
such
a
thing
has
happened
is
rebecca
folding
up
her
work
they
cling
to
their
dead
a
long
time
at
rosmersholm
helseth
if
you
ask
me
miss
i
should
say
it
is
the
dead
that
cling
to
rosmersholm
a
long
time
rebecca
looking
at
her
the
dead
helseth
yes
one
might
almost
say
that
they
do
seem
to
be
able
to
tear
themselves
away
from
those
they
have
left
behind
rebecca
what
puts
that
idea
into
your
head
helseth
well
otherwise
i
know
the
white
horses
would
not
be
seen
here
rebecca
tell
me
helseth
what
is
this
superstition
about
the
white
horses
helseth
oh
it
is
not
worth
talking
about
i
am
sure
you
believe
in
such
things
either
rebecca
do
you
believe
in
them
helseth
goes
to
the
window
and
shuts
it
oh
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
a
chance
of
laughing
at
me
miss
looks
out
see
is
that
not
rosmer
out
on
the
mill
path
again
rebecca
looking
out
that
man
out
there
goes
to
the
window
why
that
is
kroll
of
course
helseth
so
it
is
to
be
sure
rebecca
that
is
delightful
because
he
is
certain
to
be
coming
here
helseth
he
actually
comes
straight
over
the
wooden
bridge
he
does
for
all
that
she
was
his
own
sister
well
i
will
go
in
and
get
the
supper
laid
miss
goes
out
to
the
right
rebecca
stands
still
for
a
moment
then
waves
her
hand
out
of
the
window
nodding
and
smiling
darkness
is
beginning
to
fall
rebecca
going
to
the
door
on
the
right
and
calling
through
it
helseth
i
am
sure
you
wo
mind
preparing
something
extra
nice
for
supper
you
know
what
dishes
kroll
is
especially
fond
of
helseth
certainly
miss
i
will
rebecca
opening
the
door
into
the
lobby
at
last
kroll
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
kroll
coming
into
the
lobby
and
putting
down
his
stick
thank
you
are
you
sure
i
am
not
disturbing
you
rebecca
you
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
kroll
coming
into
the
room
you
are
always
so
kind
looks
round
the
room
is
john
up
in
his
room
rebecca
no
he
has
gone
out
for
a
walk
he
is
later
than
usual
of
coming
in
but
he
is
sure
to
be
back
directly
points
to
the
sofa
do
sit
down
and
wait
for
him
kroll
putting
down
his
hat
thank
you
sits
down
and
looks
about
him
how
charmingly
pretty
you
have
made
the
old
room
look
flowers
everywhere
rebecca
rosmer
is
so
fond
of
having
fresh
flowers
about
him
kroll
and
so
are
you
i
should
say
rebecca
yes
i
am
i
think
their
scent
has
such
a
delicious
effect
on
one
and
till
lately
we
had
to
deny
ourselves
that
pleasure
you
know
kroll
nodding
slowly
poor
beata
could
not
stand
the
scent
of
them
rebecca
nor
their
colours
either
they
made
her
feel
dazed
kroll
yes
i
remember
continues
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
of
voice
well
and
how
are
things
going
here
rebecca
oh
everything
goes
on
in
the
same
quiet
placid
way
one
day
is
exactly
like
another
and
how
are
things
with
you
is
your
wife
kroll
oh
my
dear
miss
west
do
let
us
talk
about
my
affairs
in
a
family
there
is
always
something
or
other
going
awry
especially
in
such
times
as
we
live
in
now
rebecca
after
a
short
pause
sitting
down
in
an
near
the
sofa
why
have
you
never
once
been
near
us
during
the
whole
of
your
holidays
kroll
oh
it
does
do
to
be
importunate
you
know
rebecca
if
you
only
knew
how
we
have
missed
you
kroll
and
besides
i
have
been
away
you
know
rebecca
yes
for
a
fortnight
or
so
i
suppose
you
have
been
going
the
round
of
the
public
meetings
kroll
nods
yes
what
do
you
say
to
that
would
you
ever
have
thought
i
would
become
a
political
agitator
in
my
old
age
eh
rebecca
smilingly
you
have
always
been
a
little
bit
of
an
agitator
kroll
kroll
oh
yes
just
for
my
own
amusement
but
for
the
future
it
is
going
to
be
in
real
earnest
do
you
ever
read
the
radical
newspapers
rebecca
yes
i
wo
deny
that
kroll
my
dear
miss
west
there
is
no
objection
to
that
not
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
rebecca
no
that
is
just
what
i
think
i
must
follow
the
course
of
events
keep
up
with
what
is
happening
kroll
well
under
any
circumstances
i
should
never
expect
you
as
a
woman
to
side
actively
with
either
party
in
the
civic
dispute
indeed
one
might
more
properly
call
it
the
civil
war
that
is
raging
here
i
dare
say
you
have
read
then
the
abuse
these
nature
gentlemen
are
pleased
to
shower
upon
me
and
the
scandalous
coarseness
they
consider
they
are
entitled
to
make
use
of
rebecca
yes
but
i
think
you
have
held
your
own
pretty
forcibly
kroll
that
i
have
though
i
say
it
i
have
tasted
blood
now
and
i
will
make
them
realise
that
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
to
take
it
lying
down
checks
himself
no
no
do
not
let
us
get
upon
that
sad
and
distressing
topic
this
evening
rebecca
no
my
dear
kroll
certainly
not
kroll
tell
me
instead
how
you
find
you
get
on
at
rosmersholm
now
that
you
are
alone
here
i
mean
since
our
poor
beata
rebecca
oh
thanks
i
get
on
very
well
here
her
death
has
made
a
great
gap
in
the
house
in
many
ways
of
course
and
one
misses
her
and
grieves
for
her
naturally
but
in
other
respects
kroll
do
you
think
you
will
remain
here
permanently
i
mean
rebecca
dear
kroll
i
really
never
think
about
it
at
all
the
fact
is
that
i
have
become
so
thoroughly
domesticated
here
that
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
belonged
to
the
place
too
kroll
you
i
should
think
you
did
rebecca
and
as
long
as
rosmer
finds
i
can
be
any
comfort
or
any
use
to
him
i
will
gladly
remain
here
undoubtedly
kroll
looking
at
her
with
some
emotion
you
know
there
is
something
splendid
about
a
woman
sacrificing
the
whole
of
her
youth
for
others
rebecca
what
else
have
i
had
to
live
for
kroll
at
first
when
you
came
here
there
was
your
perpetual
worry
with
that
unreasonable
cripple
of
a
of
yours
rebecca
you
must
think
that
west
was
as
unreasonable
as
that
when
we
lived
in
finmark
it
was
the
trying
journeys
by
sea
that
broke
him
up
but
it
is
quite
true
that
after
we
had
moved
here
there
were
one
or
two
hard
years
before
his
sufferings
were
over
kroll
were
not
the
years
that
followed
even
harder
for
you
rebecca
no
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
i
who
was
so
genuinely
fond
of
beata
and
she
poor
soul
was
so
sadly
in
need
of
care
and
sympathetic
companionship
kroll
you
deserve
to
be
thanked
and
rewarded
for
the
forbearance
with
which
you
speak
of
her
rebecca
moving
a
little
nearer
to
him
dear
kroll
you
say
that
so
kindly
and
so
sincerely
that
i
feel
sure
you
really
bear
me
no
kroll
what
do
you
mean
rebecca
well
it
would
not
be
so
very
surprising
if
it
were
rather
painful
for
you
to
see
me
a
stranger
doing
just
as
i
like
here
at
rosmersholm
kroll
how
in
the
world
could
you
think
rebecca
then
it
is
not
so
holds
out
her
hand
to
him
thank
you
kroll
thank
you
for
that
kroll
but
what
on
earth
could
make
you
take
such
an
idea
into
your
head
rebecca
i
began
to
be
afraid
it
might
be
so
as
you
have
so
seldom
been
out
here
to
see
us
lately
kroll
i
can
assure
you
you
have
been
on
the
wrong
scent
entirely
miss
west
and
in
any
case
the
situation
of
affairs
is
unchanged
in
any
essential
point
because
during
the
last
sad
years
of
poor
life
it
was
you
and
you
alone
even
then
that
looked
after
everything
here
rebecca
but
it
was
more
like
a
kind
of
regency
in
the
wife
name
kroll
whatever
it
was
i
i
will
tell
you
what
miss
west
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
should
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
against
it
if
you
but
it
does
do
to
say
such
things
rebecca
what
things
kroll
well
if
it
so
happened
that
you
were
to
step
into
the
empty
place
rebecca
i
have
the
place
i
want
already
kroll
kroll
yes
as
far
as
material
benefits
go
but
not
rebecca
interrupting
him
in
a
serious
voice
for
shame
kroll
how
can
you
sit
there
and
jest
about
such
things
kroll
oh
well
i
dare
say
our
good
john
rosmer
thinks
he
has
had
more
than
enough
of
married
life
but
all
the
same
rebecca
really
you
almost
make
me
feel
inclined
to
laugh
at
you
kroll
all
the
same
tell
me
miss
west
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
question
how
old
are
you
rebecca
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
was
on
my
last
birthday
kroll
i
am
nearly
thirty
kroll
quite
so
and
rosmer
how
old
is
he
let
me
see
he
is
five
years
younger
than
me
so
he
must
be
just
about
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
very
suitable
rebecca
no
doubt
no
doubt
it
would
be
remarkably
suitable
will
you
stop
and
have
supper
with
us
kroll
thank
you
i
had
meant
to
pay
you
a
good
long
visit
because
there
is
a
matter
i
want
to
talk
over
with
our
excellent
friend
well
then
miss
west
to
prevent
your
taking
foolish
ideas
into
your
head
again
i
will
come
out
here
again
from
time
to
time
as
in
the
old
days
rebecca
yes
please
do
holds
out
her
hand
to
him
thank
you
thank
you
you
are
really
uncommonly
kroll
with
a
little
grumble
am
i
i
can
tell
you
that
is
more
than
they
say
at
home
rosmer
comes
in
by
the
door
on
the
right
rebecca
rosmer
do
you
see
who
is
sitting
here
rosmer
helseth
told
me
kroll
gets
up
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
here
again
my
dear
fellow
puts
his
hands
on
kroll
shoulders
and
looks
him
in
the
face
dear
old
friend
i
knew
that
one
day
we
should
be
on
our
old
footing
again
kroll
my
dear
fellow
have
you
that
insane
idea
in
your
head
too
that
any
thing
could
come
between
us
rebecca
to
rosmer
is
it
delightful
to
think
it
was
all
our
imagination
rosmer
is
that
really
true
kroll
but
why
have
you
kept
so
obstinately
away
from
us
kroll
seriously
and
in
a
subdued
voice
because
i
did
not
want
to
come
here
like
a
living
reminder
of
the
unhappy
time
that
is
past
and
of
her
who
met
her
death
in
the
rosmer
it
was
a
very
kind
thought
on
your
part
you
are
always
so
considerate
but
it
was
altogether
unnecessary
to
keep
away
from
us
on
that
account
come
along
let
us
sit
down
on
the
sofa
they
sit
down
i
can
assure
you
it
is
not
in
the
least
painful
for
me
to
think
about
beata
we
talk
about
her
every
day
she
seems
to
us
to
have
a
part
in
the
house
still
kroll
does
she
really
rebecca
lighting
the
lamp
yes
it
is
really
quite
true
rosmer
she
really
does
we
both
think
so
affectionately
of
her
and
both
rebecca
both
miss
west
and
i
know
in
our
hearts
that
we
did
all
that
lay
in
our
power
for
the
poor
afflicted
creature
we
have
nothing
to
reproach
ourselves
with
that
is
why
i
feel
there
is
something
sweet
and
peaceful
in
the
way
we
can
think
of
beata
now
kroll
you
dear
good
people
in
future
i
am
coming
out
to
see
you
every
day
rebecca
sitting
down
in
an
yes
let
us
see
that
you
keep
your
word
rosmer
with
a
slight
hesitation
i
assure
you
my
dear
fellow
my
dearest
wish
would
be
that
our
intimacy
should
never
suffer
in
any
way
you
know
you
have
seemed
to
be
my
natural
adviser
as
long
as
we
have
known
one
another
even
from
my
student
days
kroll
i
know
and
i
am
very
proud
of
the
privilege
is
there
by
any
chance
anything
in
particular
just
now
rosmer
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
i
want
very
much
to
talk
over
with
you
frankly
things
that
lie
very
near
my
heart
rebecca
i
feel
that
is
so
too
rosmer
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
such
a
good
thing
if
you
two
old
friends
kroll
well
i
can
assure
you
i
have
even
more
to
talk
over
with
you
because
i
have
become
an
active
politician
as
i
dare
say
you
know
rosmer
yes
i
know
you
have
how
did
that
come
about
kroll
i
had
to
you
see
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
it
became
impossible
for
me
to
remain
an
idle
spectator
any
longer
now
that
the
radicals
have
become
so
distressingly
powerful
it
was
high
time
and
that
is
also
why
i
have
induced
our
little
circle
of
friends
in
the
town
to
bind
themselves
more
definitely
together
it
was
high
time
i
can
tell
you
rebecca
with
a
slight
smile
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
it
really
rather
late
now
kroll
there
is
no
denying
it
would
have
been
more
fortunate
if
we
had
succeeded
in
checking
the
stream
at
an
earlier
point
but
who
could
really
foresee
what
was
coming
i
am
sure
i
could
not
gets
up
and
walks
up
and
down
anyway
my
eyes
are
completely
opened
now
for
the
spirit
of
revolt
has
spread
even
into
my
school
rosmer
into
the
school
surely
not
into
your
school
kroll
indeed
it
has
into
my
own
school
what
do
you
think
of
this
i
have
got
wind
of
the
fact
that
the
boys
in
the
top
class
or
rather
a
part
of
the
boys
in
it
have
formed
themselves
into
a
secret
society
and
have
been
taking
in
mortensgaard
paper
rebecca
ah
the
searchlight
kroll
yes
do
you
think
that
is
a
nice
sort
of
intellectual
pabulum
for
future
public
servants
but
the
saddest
part
of
it
is
that
it
is
all
the
most
promising
boys
in
the
class
that
have
conspired
together
and
hatched
this
plot
against
me
it
is
only
the
duffers
and
dunces
that
have
held
aloof
from
it
rebecca
do
you
take
it
so
much
to
heart
kroll
kroll
do
i
take
it
to
heart
to
find
myself
so
hampered
and
thwarted
in
my
life
work
speaking
more
gently
i
might
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
that
i
could
even
take
that
for
what
it
is
worth
but
i
have
not
told
you
the
worst
of
it
yet
looks
round
the
room
i
suppose
nobody
is
likely
to
be
listening
at
the
doors
rebecca
oh
certainly
not
kroll
then
let
me
tell
you
that
the
revolt
and
dissension
has
spread
into
my
own
home
into
my
own
peaceful
home
and
has
disturbed
the
peace
of
my
family
life
rosmer
getting
up
do
you
mean
it
in
your
own
home
rebecca
going
up
to
kroll
dear
kroll
what
has
happened
kroll
would
you
believe
it
that
my
own
children
to
make
a
long
story
short
my
boy
laurits
is
the
moving
spirit
of
the
conspiracy
at
the
school
and
hilda
has
embroidered
a
red
portfolio
to
keep
the
numbers
of
the
searchlight
in
rosmer
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
in
your
family
in
your
own
house
kroll
no
who
would
ever
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
in
my
house
where
obedience
and
order
have
always
ruled
where
hitherto
there
has
never
been
anything
but
one
unanimous
will
rebecca
how
does
your
wife
take
it
kroll
ah
that
is
the
most
incredible
part
of
the
whole
thing
she
who
all
her
days
in
great
things
and
small
has
concurred
in
my
opinions
and
approved
of
all
my
views
has
actually
not
refrained
from
throwing
her
weight
on
the
children
side
on
many
points
and
now
she
considers
i
am
to
blame
for
what
has
happened
she
says
i
try
to
coerce
the
young
people
too
much
just
as
if
it
were
not
necessary
to
well
those
are
the
sort
of
dissensions
i
have
going
on
at
home
but
naturally
i
talk
as
little
about
it
as
possible
it
is
better
to
be
silent
about
such
things
walks
across
the
floor
oh
oh
yes
stands
by
the
window
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
looks
out
rebecca
goes
up
to
rosmer
and
speaks
in
low
hurried
tones
unheard
by
kroll
do
it
rosmer
in
the
same
tone
not
rebecca
as
before
yes
this
night
of
all
others
goes
away
from
him
and
adjusts
the
lamp
kroll
coming
back
yes
my
dear
john
so
now
you
know
the
sort
of
spirit
of
the
age
that
has
cast
its
shadow
both
over
my
home
life
and
my
official
work
ought
i
not
to
oppose
this
appalling
destructive
disorganising
tendency
with
all
the
weapons
i
can
lay
my
hands
upon
of
course
it
is
certainly
my
duty
and
that
both
with
my
pen
and
my
tongue
rosmer
but
have
you
any
hope
that
you
can
produce
any
effect
in
that
way
kroll
at
all
events
i
mean
to
take
my
share
in
the
fight
as
a
citizen
and
i
consider
that
it
is
the
duty
of
every
patriotic
man
every
man
who
is
concerned
about
what
is
right
to
do
the
same
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
is
really
the
reason
why
i
have
come
here
to
see
you
rosmer
my
dear
fellow
what
do
you
mean
what
can
i
kroll
you
are
going
to
help
your
old
friends
and
do
as
we
are
doing
take
your
share
in
it
to
the
best
of
your
ability
rebecca
but
kroll
you
know
how
little
taste
rosmer
has
for
that
sort
of
thing
kroll
then
he
has
got
to
overcome
that
distaste
now
you
do
not
keep
abreast
of
the
times
john
you
sit
here
and
bury
yourself
in
your
historical
researches
goodness
knows
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
family
pedigrees
and
all
that
they
imply
but
this
is
not
the
time
for
such
occupations
unhappily
you
have
no
conception
of
the
state
of
affairs
that
is
going
on
all
over
the
country
every
single
idea
is
turned
upside
down
or
very
nearly
so
it
will
be
a
hard
fight
to
get
all
the
errors
straightened
out
again
rosmer
i
can
quite
believe
it
but
that
sort
of
a
fight
is
not
in
my
line
at
all
rebecca
besides
i
rather
fancy
that
rosmer
has
come
to
look
at
the
affairs
of
life
with
wider
opened
eyes
than
before
kroll
with
a
start
wider
opened
eyes
rebecca
yes
or
with
an
opener
mind
with
less
prejudice
kroll
what
do
you
mean
by
that
john
surely
you
could
never
be
so
weak
as
to
allow
yourself
to
be
deluded
by
the
accidental
circumstance
that
the
demagogues
have
scored
a
temporary
success
rosmer
my
dear
fellow
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
no
judge
of
politics
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
of
late
years
individual
thought
has
become
somewhat
more
independent
kroll
quite
so
but
do
you
consider
that
as
a
matter
of
course
to
be
a
good
thing
in
any
case
you
are
vastly
mistaken
my
friend
just
inquire
a
little
into
the
opinions
that
are
current
amongst
the
radicals
both
out
here
in
the
country
and
in
town
you
will
find
them
to
be
nothing
else
than
the
words
of
wisdom
that
appear
in
the
searchlight
rebecca
yes
mortensgaard
has
a
great
deal
of
influence
over
the
people
about
here
kroll
yes
just
think
of
it
a
man
with
as
dirty
a
record
as
his
a
fellow
that
was
turned
out
of
his
place
as
a
schoolmaster
because
of
his
immoral
conduct
this
is
the
sort
of
man
that
poses
as
a
leader
of
the
people
and
successfully
too
actually
successfully
i
hear
that
he
means
to
enlarge
his
paper
now
i
know
on
reliable
authority
that
he
is
looking
for
a
competent
assistant
rebecca
it
seems
to
me
surprising
that
you
and
your
friends
do
not
start
an
opposition
paper
kroll
that
is
exactly
what
we
intend
to
do
this
very
day
we
have
bought
the
county
news
there
was
no
difficulty
about
the
financial
side
of
the
matter
but
turns
towards
rosmer
now
we
have
come
to
the
real
purport
of
my
visit
it
is
the
management
of
it
the
editorial
management
that
is
the
difficulty
you
see
look
here
rosmer
you
feel
called
upon
to
undertake
it
for
the
sake
of
the
good
cause
rosmer
in
a
tone
of
consternation
i
rebecca
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
kroll
i
can
quite
understand
your
having
a
horror
of
public
meetings
and
being
unwilling
to
expose
yourself
to
the
mercies
of
the
rabble
that
frequents
them
but
an
editor
work
which
is
carried
on
in
much
greater
privacy
or
rather
rosmer
no
no
my
dear
fellow
you
must
not
ask
that
of
me
kroll
it
would
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
have
a
try
at
work
of
that
sort
myself
only
it
would
be
quite
out
of
the
question
for
me
i
am
already
saddled
with
such
an
endless
number
of
duties
you
on
the
other
hand
who
are
no
longer
hampered
by
any
official
duties
might
of
course
the
rest
of
us
would
give
you
all
the
help
in
our
power
rosmer
i
can
not
do
it
kroll
i
am
not
fitted
for
it
kroll
not
fitted
for
it
that
was
just
what
you
said
when
your
father
got
you
your
living
rosmer
i
was
quite
right
and
that
was
why
i
resigned
it
too
kroll
well
if
you
only
make
as
good
an
editor
as
you
did
a
parson
we
shall
be
quite
satisfied
rosmer
my
dear
kroll
once
for
all
i
can
not
do
it
kroll
well
then
i
suppose
you
will
give
us
the
use
of
your
name
at
all
events
rosmer
my
name
kroll
yes
the
mere
fact
of
john
rosmer
name
being
connected
with
it
will
be
a
great
advantage
to
the
paper
we
others
are
looked
upon
as
pronounced
partisans
i
myself
even
have
the
reputation
of
being
a
wicked
fanatic
i
am
told
therefore
we
can
not
count
upon
our
own
names
to
give
us
any
particular
help
in
making
the
paper
known
to
the
misguided
masses
but
you
on
the
contrary
have
always
held
aloof
from
this
kind
of
fighting
your
gentle
and
upright
disposition
your
polished
mind
your
unimpeachable
honour
are
known
to
and
appreciated
by
every
one
about
here
and
then
there
is
the
deference
and
respect
that
your
former
position
as
a
clergyman
ensures
for
you
and
besides
that
there
is
the
veneration
in
which
your
family
name
is
held
rosmer
oh
my
family
name
kroll
pointing
to
the
portraits
rosmers
of
rosmersholm
clergymen
soldiers
men
who
have
filled
high
places
in
the
state
men
of
scrupulous
honour
every
one
of
them
a
family
that
has
been
rooted
here
the
most
influential
in
the
place
for
nearly
two
centuries
lays
his
hand
on
rosmer
shoulder
john
you
owe
it
to
yourself
and
to
the
traditions
of
your
race
to
join
us
in
defence
of
all
that
has
hitherto
been
held
sacred
in
our
community
turning
to
rebecca
what
do
you
say
miss
west
rebecca
with
a
quiet
little
laugh
my
dear
kroll
it
all
sounds
so
absurdly
ludicrous
to
me
kroll
what
ludicrous
rebecca
yes
because
it
is
time
you
were
told
plainly
rosmer
hurriedly
no
no
do
not
now
kroll
looking
from
one
to
the
other
but
my
dear
friends
what
on
earth
breaks
off
as
helseth
comes
in
by
the
door
on
the
right
ahem
helseth
there
is
a
man
at
the
kitchen
door
sir
he
says
he
wants
to
see
you
rosmer
in
a
relieved
voice
is
there
well
ask
him
to
come
in
helseth
shall
i
show
him
in
here
sir
rosmer
certainly
helseth
but
he
does
look
the
sort
of
man
one
ought
to
allow
in
here
rebecca
what
does
he
look
like
helseth
helseth
oh
he
is
not
much
to
look
at
miss
rosmer
did
he
not
give
you
his
name
helseth
yes
i
think
he
said
it
was
hekman
or
something
like
that
rosmer
i
do
not
know
any
one
of
that
name
helseth
and
he
said
his
christian
name
was
ulrik
rosmer
with
a
start
of
surprise
ulrik
hetman
was
that
it
helseth
yes
sir
it
was
hetman
kroll
i
am
certain
i
have
heard
that
name
before
rebecca
surely
it
was
the
name
that
strange
creature
used
to
write
under
rosmer
to
kroll
it
is
ulrik
brendel
pseudonym
you
know
kroll
that
scamp
ulrik
brendel
you
are
quite
right
rebecca
so
he
is
alive
still
rosmer
i
thought
he
was
travelling
with
a
theatrical
company
kroll
the
last
i
heard
of
him
was
that
he
was
in
the
workhouse
rosmer
ask
him
to
come
in
helseth
helseth
yes
sir
goes
out
kroll
do
you
really
mean
to
allow
this
fellow
into
your
house
rosmer
oh
well
you
know
he
was
my
tutor
once
kroll
i
know
that
what
he
did
was
to
stuff
your
head
with
revolutionary
ideas
and
that
in
consequence
your
father
turned
him
out
of
the
house
with
a
horsewhip
rosmer
a
little
bitterly
yes
my
father
was
always
the
commanding
officer
even
at
home
kroll
be
grateful
to
his
memory
for
that
my
dear
john
ah
helseth
shows
ulrik
brendel
in
at
the
door
then
goes
out
and
shuts
the
door
after
her
brendel
is
a
man
with
grey
hair
and
beard
somewhat
emaciated
but
active
and
alert
he
is
dressed
like
a
common
tramp
in
a
threadbare
frock
coat
shoes
with
holes
in
them
and
no
visible
linen
at
his
neck
or
wrists
he
wears
a
pair
of
old
black
gloves
carries
a
dirty
soft
hat
under
his
arm
and
has
a
in
his
hand
he
looks
puzzled
at
first
then
goes
quickly
up
to
kroll
and
holds
out
his
hand
to
him
brendel
john
kroll
excuse
me
brendel
did
you
ever
expect
to
see
me
again
and
inside
these
hated
walls
too
kroll
excuse
me
points
to
rosmer
over
there
brendel
turning
round
quite
right
there
he
is
john
my
boy
my
favourite
pupil
rosmer
shaking
hands
with
him
my
old
tutor
brendel
in
spite
of
certain
recollections
i
could
not
pass
by
rosmersholm
without
paying
you
a
flying
visit
rosmer
you
are
very
welcome
here
now

sure
of
that

colleague

moment

student
days

used
to

of
those
champions
of

the
virtues

out
of

disclaim

other
acquaintance
with
you

right
nach
belieben

say

shall
get
over

spite
of
it
rebecca
are
you
on
your
way
to
the
town
brendel
brendel
you
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
at
certain
intervals
i
am
obliged
to
do
something
for
my
living
i
do
not
do
it
willingly
but
enfin
when
needs
must
rosmer
my
dear
brendel
will
you
not
let
me
be
of
assistance
to
you
in
some
way
or
another
i
mean
brendel
ah
what
a
proposal
to
come
from
you
could
you
wish
to
soil
the
tie
that
binds
us
together
never
john
never
rosmer
but
what
do
you
propose
to
do
in
the
town

i
assure
you
you
wo
find
it
so
easy
brendel
leave
that
to
me
my
boy

die
is
cast
the
unworthy
individual
who
stands
before
you
is
started
on
an
extensive
campaign
more
extensive
than
all
his
former
excursions
put
together
to
kroll
may
i
venture
to
ask
you
professor
unter
uns
are
there
in
your
esteemed
town
any
fairly
decent
respectable
and
spacious
kroll
the
most
spacious
is
the
hall
belonging
to
the
working
association
brendel
may
i
ask
sir
if
you
have
any
special
influence
with
that
no
doubt
most
useful
association
kroll
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
rebecca
to
brendel
you
ought
to
apply
to
peter
mortensgaard
brendel
pardon
madame
what
sort
of
an
idiot
is
he
rosmer
why
do
you
make
up
your
mind
he
is
an
idiot
brendel
do
you
suppose
i
ca
tell
from
the
sound
of
the
name
that
it
belongs
to
a
plebeian
kroll
i
did
not
expect
that
answer
brendel
but
i
will
conquer
my
prejudices
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
when
a
man
stands
at
a
in
his
life
as
i
do
that
is
settled
i
shall
put
myself
into
communication
with
this
person
commence
direct
negotiations
rosmer
are
you
in
earnest
when
you
say
you
are
standing
at
a
in
your
life
brendel
does
my
own
boy
not
know
that
wherever
ulrik
brendel
stands
he
is
always
in
earnest
about
it
look
here
i
mean
to
become
a
new
man
now
to
emerge
from
the
cloak
of
reserve
in
which
i
have
hitherto
shrouded
myself
rosmer
in
what
way
brendel
i
mean
to
take
an
active
part
in
life
to
step
forward
to
look
higher
the
atmosphere
we
breathe
is
heavy
with
storms
i
want
now
to
offer
my
mite
upon
the
altar
of
emancipation
kroll
you
too
brendel
to
them
all
has
your
public
here
any
intimate
acquaintance
with
my
scattered
writings
kroll
no
i
must
candidly
confess
that
rebecca
i
have
read
several
of
them
my
had
them
brendel
my
dear
lady
then
you
have
wasted
your
time
they
are
simply
trash
allow
me
to
tell
you
rebecca
really
brendel
those
you
have
read
yes
my
really
important
works
no
man
or
woman
knows
anything
about
no
one
except
myself
rebecca
how
is
that
brendel
because
they
are
not
yet
written
rosmer
but
my
dear
brendel
brendel
you
know
my
dear
john
that
i
am
a
bit
of
a
sybarite
a
gourmet
i
have
always
been
so
i
have
a
taste
for
solitary
enjoyment
because
in
that
way
my
enjoyment
is
twice
ten
times
as
keen
it
is
like
this
when
i
have
been
wrapped
in
a
haze
of
golden
dreams
that
have
descended
on
me
when
new
intoxicating
momentous
thoughts
have
had
their
birth
in
my
mind
and
i
have
been
fanned
by
the
beat
of
their
wings
as
they
bore
me
aloft
at
such
moments
i
have
transformed
them
into
poetry
into
visions
into
pictures
in
general
outlines
that
is
to
say
rosmer
quite
so
brendel
you
can
not
imagine
the
luxury
of
enjoyment
i
have
experienced
the
mysterious
rapture
of
creation
in
general
outlines
as
i
said
applause
gratitude
eulogies
crowns
of
laurel
all
these
i
have
culled
with
full
hands
trembling
with
joy
in
my
secret
ecstasies
i
have
steeped
myself
in
a
happiness
so
intoxicating
kroll
ahem
rosmer
but
you
have
never
written
anything
of
it
down
brendel
not
a
word
the
thought
of
the
dull
clerk
work
that
it
would
mean
has
always
moved
me
to
a
nauseating
sense
of
disgust
besides
why
should
i
profane
my
own
ideals
when
i
could
enjoy
them
in
all
their
purity
by
myself
but
now
they
shall
be
sacrificed
honestly
i
feel
as
a
mother
must
do
when
she
entrusts
her
young
daughter
to
the
arms
of
a
husband
but
i
am
going
to
sacrifice
them
nevertheless
sacrifice
them
on
the
altar
of
emancipation
a
series
of
carefully
lectures
to
be
delivered
all
over
the
country
rebecca
impetuously
that
is
splendid
of
you
brendel
you
are
giving
up
the
most
precious
thing
you
possess
rosmer
the
only
thing
rebecca
looking
meaningly
at
rosmer
i
wonder
how
many
there
are
who
would
do
as
much
who
dare
do
it
rosmer
returning
her
look
who
knows
brendel
my
audience
is
moved
that
refreshes
my
heart
and
strengthens
my
will
and
now
i
shall
proceed
upon
my
task
forthwith
there
is
one
other
point
though
to
kroll
can
you
inform
me
sir
whether
there
is
an
abstainers
society
in
the
town
a
total
abstainers
society
i
feel
sure
there
must
be
kroll
there
is
one
at
your
service
i
am
the
president
brendel
i
could
tell
that
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
well
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
that
i
may
come
to
you
and
become
a
member
for
a
week
kroll
excuse
me
we
do
not
accept
weekly
members
brendel
a
la
bonne
heure
my
good
sir
ulrik
brendel
has
never
been
in
the
habit
of
forcing
himself
upon
societies
of
that
kind
turns
to
go
but
i
must
not
prolong
my
stay
in
this
house
rich
as
it
is
in
memories
i
must
go
into
the
town
and
find
some
suitable
lodging
i
shall
find
a
decent
hotel
of
some
kind
there
i
hope
rebecca
will
you
not
have
something
hot
to
drink
before
you
go
brendel
of
what
nature
dear
lady
rebecca
a
cup
of
tea
or
brendel
a
thousand
thanks
to
the
most
generous
of
hostesses
but
i
do
not
like
trespassing
on
private
hospitality
waves
his
hand
to
you
all
goes
to
the
door
but
turns
back
oh
by
the
way
john
rosmer
will
you
do
your
former
tutor
a
service
for
old
friendship
sake
rosmer
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
brendel
good
well
then
lend
me
just
for
a
day
or
two
a
starched
shirt
rosmer
nothing
more
than
that
brendel
because
you
see
i
am
travelling
on
foot
on
this
occasion
my
trunk
is
being
sent
after
me
rosmer
quite
so
but
in
that
case
is
there
anything
else
brendel
well
i
will
tell
you
what
perhaps
you
have
an
old
summer
coat
that
you
could
spare
rosmer
certainly
i
have
brendel
and
if
there
happened
to
be
a
pair
of
presentable
shoes
that
would
go
with
the
coat
rosmer
i
am
sure
we
can
manage
that
too
as
soon
as
you
let
us
know
your
address
we
will
send
the
things
to
you
brendel
please
do
think
of
it
no
one
must
be
put
to
any
inconvenience
on
my
account
i
will
take
the
trifles
with
me
rosmer
very
well
will
you
come
upstairs
with
me
then
rebecca
let
me
go
helseth
and
i
will
see
about
it
brendel
i
could
never
think
of
allowing
this
charming
lady
rebecca
nonsense
come
along
brendel
she
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
right
rosmer
holding
brendel
back
tell
me
is
there
no
other
way
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
brendel
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
of
any
yes
perdition
seize
it
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
john
do
you
happen
to
have
seven
or
eight
shillings
on
you
rosmer
i
will
see
opens
his
purse
i
have
two
here
brendel
oh
well
never
mind
i
may
as
well
take
them
i
can
always
get
change
in
town
thanks
in
the
meantime
remember
that
it
was
two
i
had
my
own
dear
boy
to
you
sir
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
right
where
rosmer
takes
leave
of
him
and
shuts
the
door
after
him
kroll
good
heavens
and
that
is
the
ulrik
brendel
of
whom
people
once
thought
that
he
would
do
great
things
rosmer
at
all
events
he
has
had
the
courage
to
live
his
life
in
his
own
way
i
do
not
think
that
is
such
a
small
thing
after
all
kroll
what
a
life
like
his
i
almost
believe
he
would
have
the
power
even
now
to
disturb
all
your
ideas
rosmer
no
indeed
i
have
come
to
a
clear
understanding
with
myself
now
upon
all
points
kroll
i
wish
i
could
believe
it
my
dear
rosmer
you
are
so
dreadfully
susceptible
to
impressions
from
without
rosmer
let
us
sit
down
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
kroll
by
all
means
they
sit
down
on
the
couch
rosmer
after
a
short
pause
do
you
think
everything
here
looks
very
pleasant
and
comfortable
kroll
yes
it
looks
very
pleasant
and
comfortable
now
and
peaceful
you
have
made
yourself
a
real
home
rosmer
and
i
have
lost
mine
rosmer
my
dear
fellow
do
not
say
that
there
may
seem
to
be
a
rift
just
now
but
it
will
heal
again
kroll
never
never
the
sting
will
always
remain
things
can
never
be
as
they
were
before
rosmer
i
want
to
ask
you
something
kroll
you
and
i
have
been
the
closest
of
friends
now
for
so
many
years
does
it
seem
to
you
conceivable
that
anything
could
destroy
our
friendship
kroll
i
can
not
imagine
anything
that
could
cause
a
breach
between
us
what
has
put
that
into
your
head
rosmer
well
your
attaching
such
tremendous
importance
to
similarity
of
opinions
and
views
kroll
certainly
i
do
but
then
we
two
hold
pretty
similar
opinions
at
all
events
on
the
most
essential
points
rosmer
gently
no
not
any
longer
kroll
trying
to
jump
up
from
his
seat
what
is
this
rosmer
restraining
him
no
you
must
sit
still
please
kroll
kroll
what
does
it
all
mean
i
do
not
understand
you
tell
me
straight
out
rosmer
a
new
summer
has
blossomed
in
my
heart
my
eyes
have
regained
the
clearness
of
youth
and
accordingly
i
am
now
standing
where
kroll
where
where
are
you
standing
rosmer
where
your
children
are
standing
kroll
you
you
the
thing
is
impossible
where
do
you
say
you
are
standing
rosmer
on
the
same
side
as
laurits
and
hilda
kroll
letting
his
head
drop
an
apostate
john
rosmer
an
apostate
rosmer
what
you
are
calling
apostasy
ought
to
have
made
me
feel
sincerely
happy
and
fortunate
but
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
keenly
because
i
knew
quite
well
it
would
cause
you
bitter
sorrow
kroll
rosmer
rosmer
i
shall
never
get
over
this
looks
at
him
sadly
to
think
that
you
too
could
bring
yourself
to
sympathise
with
and
join
in
the
work
of
disorder
and
ruin
that
is
playing
havoc
with
our
unhappy
country
rosmer
it
is
the
work
of
emancipation
that
i
sympathise
with
kroll
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
that
that
is
what
it
is
called
by
both
those
who
are
leading
the
people
astray
and
by
their
misguided
victims
but
be
sure
of
this
you
need
expect
no
emancipation
to
be
the
result
of
the
spirit
that
relies
on
the
poisoning
of
the
whole
of
our
social
life
rosmer
i
do
not
give
my
allegiance
to
the
spirit
that
is
directing
this
nor
to
any
of
those
who
are
leading
the
fight
i
want
to
try
to
bring
men
of
all
shades
of
opinion
together
as
many
as
i
can
reach
and
bind
them
as
closely
together
as
i
can
i
want
to
live
for
and
devote
all
the
strength
that
is
in
me
to
one
end
only
to
create
a
real
public
opinion
in
the
country
kroll
so
you
do
not
consider
that
we
have
sufficient
public
opinion
i
for
my
part
consider
that
the
whole
lot
of
us
are
on
the
high
road
to
be
dragged
down
into
the
mire
where
otherwise
only
the
common
people
would
be
wallowing
rosmer
it
is
just
for
that
reason
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
should
be
the
real
task
of
public
opinion
kroll
what
task
rosmer
the
task
of
making
all
our
into
men
of
nobility
kroll
all
our
rosmer
as
many
as
possible
at
all
events
kroll
by
what
means
rosmer
by
emancipating
their
ideas
and
purifying
their
aspirations
it
seems
to
me
kroll
you
are
a
dreamer
rosmer
are
you
going
to
emancipate
them
are
you
going
to
purify
them
rosmer
no
my
dear
fellow
i
can
only
try
to
awake
the
desire
for
it
in
them
the
doing
of
it
rests
with
themselves
kroll
and
do
you
think
they
are
capable
of
it
rosmer
yes
kroll
of
their
own
power
rosmer
yes
of
their
own
power
there
is
no
other
that
can
do
it
kroll
getting
up
is
that
speaking
as
befits
a
clergyman
rosmer
i
am
a
clergyman
no
longer
kroll
yes
but
what
of
the
faith
you
were
brought
up
in
rosmer
i
have
it
no
longer
kroll
you
have
it
no
longer
rosmer
getting
up
i
have
given
it
up
i
had
to
give
it
up
kroll
kroll
controlling
his
emotion
i
see
yes
yes
the
one
thing
implies
the
other
was
that
the
reason
then
why
you
left
the
service
of
the
church
rosmer
yes
when
my
mind
was
clearly
made
up
when
i
felt
the
certainty
that
it
was
not
merely
a
transitory
temptation
but
that
it
was
something
that
i
would
neither
have
the
power
nor
the
desire
to
dismiss
from
my
mind
then
i
took
that
step
kroll
so
it
has
been
fermenting
in
your
mind
as
long
as
that
and
we
your
friends
have
never
been
allowed
to
know
anything
of
it
rosmer
rosmer
how
could
you
hide
the
sorrowful
truth
from
us
rosmer
because
i
considered
it
was
a
matter
that
only
concerned
myself
and
therefore
i
did
not
wish
to
cause
you
and
my
other
friends
any
unnecessary
pain
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
live
my
life
here
as
i
have
done
hitherto
peacefully
and
happily
i
wanted
to
read
and
absorb
myself
in
all
the
works
that
so
far
had
been
sealed
books
to
me
to
familiarise
myself
thoroughly
with
the
great
world
of
truth
and
freedom
that
has
been
disclosed
to
me
now
kroll
an
apostate
every
word
you
say
bears
witness
to
that
but
for
all
that
why
have
you
made
this
confession
of
your
secret
apostasy
or
why
just
at
the
present
moment
rosmer
you
yourself
have
compelled
me
to
it
kroll
kroll
i
i
have
compelled
you
rosmer
when
i
heard
of
your
violent
behaviour
at
public
meetings
when
i
read
the
reports
of
all
the
vehement
speeches
you
made
there
of
all
your
bitter
attacks
upon
those
that
were
on
the
other
side
your
scornful
censure
of
your
opponents
oh
kroll
to
think
that
you
you
could
be
the
man
to
do
that
then
my
eyes
were
opened
to
my
imperative
duty
mankind
is
suffering
from
the
strife
that
is
going
on
now
and
we
ought
to
bring
peace
and
happiness
and
a
spirit
of
reconciliation
into
their
souls
that
is
why
i
step
forward
now
and
confess
myself
openly
for
what
i
am
and
besides
i
want
to
put
my
powers
to
the
test
as
well
as
others
could
not
you
from
your
side
go
with
me
in
that
kroll
kroll
never
as
long
as
i
live
will
i
make
any
alliance
with
the
forces
of
disorder
in
the
community
rosmer
well
let
us
at
least
fight
with
honourable
weapons
since
it
seems
we
must
fight
kroll
i
can
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
any
one
who
does
not
think
with
me
on
matters
of
vital
importance
and
i
owe
such
a
man
no
consideration
rosmer
does
that
apply
even
to
me
kroll
you
yourself
have
broken
with
me
rosmer
rosmer
but
does
this
really
mean
a
breach
between
us
kroll
between
us
it
is
a
breach
with
all
those
who
have
hitherto
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
you
and
now
you
must
take
the
consequences
rebecca
comes
in
from
the
room
on
the
right
and
opens
the
door
wide
rebecca
well
that
is
done
we
have
started
him
off
on
the
road
to
his
great
sacrifice
and
now
we
can
go
in
to
supper
will
you
come
in
kroll
kroll
taking
his
hat
miss
west
this
is
no
longer
any
place
for
me
rebecca
excitedly
what
do
you
mean
shuts
the
door
and
comes
nearer
to
the
two
men
have
you
told
him
rosmer
he
knows
now
kroll
we
shall
not
let
you
slip
out
of
our
hands
rosmer
we
shall
compel
you
to
come
back
to
us
again
rosmer
i
shall
never
find
myself
there
any
more
kroll
we
shall
see
you
are
not
the
man
to
endure
standing
alone
rosmer
i
am
not
so
entirely
alone
even
now
there
are
two
of
us
to
bear
the
solitude
together
here
kroll
ah
a
suspicion
appears
to
cross
his
mind
that
too
words
rosmer
beata
kroll
dismissing
the
thought
from
his
mind
no
no
that
was
odious
of
me
forgive
me
rosmer
what
what
do
you
mean
kroll
think
no

your
head
about

he
meant
himself
but

goodnight
rebecca

you
going
up
so
early
after

rosmer

a
sense
of
relief
now
that
it
is
over

dear
rebecca

rebecca

out
by

his
footsteps
are

to
the
wall
and
rings
a
bell

is
answered
by

helseth
rosmer

wrong
with
him
miss
rebecca

up
her
he
prophesied
that
there
was
a
heavy
storm
brewing
helseth
that

very
strange
miss
because
there
is
a
scrap
of
cloud
in
the
sky
rebecca
let
us
hope

does
meet

you
miss

talk
of

a
dreadful
thing
rebecca

you
really
think
miss
that
some
one
here
is
to

bit
of
it
but
there

so
many
sorts
of
white
horses

this
world

my
room

the

of
the

a
doorway
with
a
curtain
drawn
back
from
it
leading
to
his
bedroom
on
the

a
window
in

of
which
is

strewn
with
books
and
papers
bookshelves
and
cupboards

homely

an

at
the
on
a
chair
he
is
cutting
and
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
magazine
and
dipping
into
it

and
there
a
knock
is
heard
at

rosmer
without
turning
round
come
in
rebecca
comes
in
wearing
a
morning
wrapper
rebecca
good
morning
rosmer
still
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
book
good
morning
dear
do
you
want
anything
rebecca
only
to
ask
if
you
have
slept
well
rosmer
i
went
to
sleep
feeling
so
secure
and
happy
i
did
not
even
dream
turns
round
and
you
rebecca
thanks
i
got
to
sleep
in
the
early
morning
rosmer
i
do
not
think
i
have
felt
so
for
a
long
time
as
i
do
i
am
so
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
say
what
i
did
rebecca
yes
you
should
not
have
been
silent
so
long
john
rosmer
i
can
not
understand
how
i
came
to
be
such
a
coward
rebecca
i
am
sure
it
was
not
really
from
cowardice
rosmer
yes
indeed
i
can
see
that
at
bottom
there
was
some
cowardice
about
it
rebecca
so
much
the
braver
of
you
to
face
it
as
you
did
sits
down
beside
him
on
a
chair
by
the
but
now
i
want
to
confess
something
that
i
have
done
something
that
you
must
not
be
vexed
with
me
about
rosmer
vexed
my
dear
girl
how
can
you
think
rebecca
yes
because
i
dare
say
it
was
a
little
presumptuous
of
me
but
rosmer
well
let
me
hear
what
it
was
rebecca
last
night
when
that
ulrick
brendel
was
going
i
wrote
him
a
line
or
two
to
take
to
mortensgaard
rosmer
a
little
doubtfully
but
my
dear
rebecca
what
did
you
write
then
rebecca
i
wrote
that
he
would
be
doing
you
a
service
if
he
would
interest
himself
a
little
in
that
unfortunate
man
and
help
him
in
any
way
he
could
rosmer
my
dear
you
should
not
have
done
that
you
have
only
done
brendel
harm
by
doing
so
and
besides
mortensgaard
is
a
man
i
particularly
wish
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
know
i
have
been
at
loggerheads
once
with
him
already
rebecca
but
do
you
not
think
that
now
it
might
be
a
very
good
thing
if
you
got
on
to
good
terms
with
him
again
rosmer
i
with
mortensgaard
for
what
reason
do
you
mean
rebecca
well
because
you
can
not
feel
altogether
secure
now
since
this
has
come
between
you
and
your
friends
rosmer
looking
at
her
and
shaking
his
head
is
it
possible
that
you
think
either
kroll
or
any
of
the
others
would
take
a
revenge
on
me
that
they
could
be
capable
of
rebecca
in
their
first
heat
of
indignation
dear
no
one
can
be
certain
of
that
i
think
after
the
way
kroll
took
it
rosmer
oh
you
ought
to
know
him
better
than
that
kroll
is
an
honourable
man
through
and
through
i
will
go
into
town
this
afternoon
and
have
a
talk
with
him
i
will
have
a
talk
with
them
all
oh
you
will
see
how
smoothly
everything
will
go
helseth
comes
in
by
the
door
on
the
left
rebecca
getting
up
what
is
it
helseth
helseth
kroll
is
downstairs
in
the
hall
miss
rosmer
getting
up
quickly
kroll
rebecca
kroll
what
a
surprise
helseth
he
asks
if
he
may
come
up
and
speak
to
rosmer
rosmer
to
rebecca
what
did
i
say
to
helseth
of
course
he
may
goes
to
the
door
and
calls
down
the
stairs
come
up
my
dear
fellow
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
he
stands
holding
the
door
open
helseth
goes
out
rebecca
draws
the
curtain
over
the
doorway
at
the
back
and
then
begins
to
tidy
the
room
kroll
comes
in
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
rosmer
quietly
and
with
some
emotion
i
knew
quite
well
it
would
not
be
the
last
time
kroll
i
see
the
matter
in
quite
a
different
light
from
yesterday
rosmer
of
course
you
do
kroll
of
course
you
do
you
have
been
thinking
things
over
kroll
you
misunderstand
me
altogether
puts
his
hat
down
on
the
table
it
is
important
that
i
should
speak
to
you
alone
rosmer
why
may
not
miss
west
rebecca
no
no
rosmer
i
will
go
kroll
looking
meaningly
at
her
and
i
see
i
ought
to
apologise
to
you
miss
west
for
coming
here
so
early
in
the
morning
i
see
i
have
taken
you
by
surprise
before
you
have
had
time
to
rebecca
with
a
start
why
so
do
you
find
anything
out
of
place
in
the
fact
of
my
wearing
a
morning
wrapper
at
home
here
kroll
by
no
means
besides
i
have
no
knowledge
of
what
customs
may
have
grown
up
at
rosmersholm
rosmer
kroll
you
are
not
the
least
like
yourself
rebecca
i
will
wish
you
good
morning
kroll
goes
out
to
the
left
kroll
if
you
will
allow
me
sits
down
on
the
couch
rosmer
yes
my
dear
fellow
let
us
make
ourselves
comfortable
and
have
a
confidential
talk
sits
down
on
a
chair
facing
kroll
kroll
i
have
not
been
able
to
close
an
eye
since
yesterday
i
lay
all
night
thinking
and
thinking
rosmer
and
what
have
you
got
to
say
kroll
it
will
take
me
some
time
rosmer
let
me
begin
with
a
sort
of
introduction
i
can
give
you
some
news
of
ulrick
brendel
rosmer
has
he
been
to
see
you
kroll
no
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
a
tavern
in
the
lowest
kind
of
company
of
course
drank
and
stood
drinks
to
others
as
long
as
he
had
any
money
left
and
then
began
to
abuse
the
whole
lot
of
them
as
a
contemptible
rabble
and
indeed
as
far
as
that
goes
he
was
quite
right
but
the
result
was
that
he
got
a
thrashing
and
was
thrown
out
into
the
gutter
rosmer
i
see
he
is
altogether
incorrigible
kroll
he
had
pawned
the
coat
you
gave
him
too
but
that
is
going
to
be
redeemed
for
him
can
you
guess
by
whom
rosmer
by
yourself
perhaps
kroll
no
by
our
noble
friend
mortensgaard
rosmer
is
that
so
kroll
i
am
informed
that
brendel
first
visit
was
paid
to
the
idiot
and
plebeian
rosmer
well
it
was
very
lucky
for
him
kroll
indeed
it
was
leans
over
the
table
towards
rosmer
now
i
am
coming
to
a
matter
of
which
for
the
sake
of
our
old
our
former
friendship
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
rosmer
my
dear
fellow
what
is
that
kroll
it
is
this
that
certain
games
are
going
on
behind
your
back
in
this
house
rosmer
how
can
you
think
that
is
it
rebec
is
it
miss
west
you
are
alluding
to
kroll
precisely
and
i
can
quite
understand
it
on
her
part
she
has
been
accustomed
for
such
a
long
time
now
to
do
as
she
likes
here
but
nevertheless
rosmer
my
dear
kroll
you
are
absolutely
mistaken
she
and
i
have
no
secrets
from
one
another
about
anything
whatever
kroll
then
has
she
confessed
to
you
that
she
has
been
corresponding
with
the
editor
of
the
searchlight
rosmer
oh
you
mean
the
couple
of
lines
she
wrote
to
him
on
ulrik
brendel
behalf
kroll
you
have
found
that
out
then
and
do
you
approve
of
her
being
on
terms
of
this
sort
with
that
scurrilous
hack
who
almost
every
week
tries
to
pillory
me
for
my
attitude
in
my
school
and
out
of
it
rosmer
my
dear
fellow
i
do
suppose
that
side
of
the
question
has
ever
occurred
to
her
and
in
any
case
of
course
she
has
entire
freedom
of
action
just
as
i
have
myself
kroll
indeed
well
i
suppose
that
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
new
turn
your
views
have
taken
because
i
suppose
miss
west
looks
at
things
from
the
same
standpoint
as
you
rosmer
she
does
we
two
have
worked
our
way
forward
in
complete
companionship
kroll
looking
at
him
and
shaking
his
head
slowly
oh
you
blind
deluded
man
rosmer
i
what
makes
you
say
that
kroll
because
i
dare
not
i
will
not
think
the
worst
no
no
let
me
finish
what
i
want
to
say
am
i
to
believe
that
you
really
prize
my
friendship
rosmer
and
my
respect
too
do
you
rosmer
surely
i
need
not
answer
that
question
kroll
well
but
there
are
other
things
that
require
answering
that
require
full
explanation
on
your
part
will
you
submit
to
it
if
i
hold
a
sort
of
inquiry
rosmer
an
inquiry
kroll
yes
if
i
ask
you
questions
about
one
or
two
things
that
it
may
be
painful
for
you
to
recall
to
mind
for
instance
the
matter
of
your
apostasy
well
your
emancipation
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
is
bound
up
with
so
much
else
for
which
for
your
own
sake
you
ought
to
account
to
me
rosmer
my
dear
fellow
ask
me
about
anything
you
please
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
kroll
well
then
tell
me
this
what
do
you
yourself
believe
was
the
real
reason
of
beata
making
away
with
herself
rosmer
can
you
have
any
doubt
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
need
one
look
for
reasons
for
what
an
unhappy
sick
woman
who
is
unaccountable
for
her
actions
may
do
kroll
are
you
certain
that
beata
was
so
entirely
unaccountable
for
her
actions
the
doctors
at
all
events
did
not
consider
that
so
absolutely
certain
rosmer
if
the
doctors
had
ever
seen
her
in
the
state
in
which
i
have
so
often
seen
her
both
night
and
day
they
would
have
had
no
doubt
about
it
kroll
i
did
not
doubt
it
either
at
the
time
rosmer
of
course
not
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
it
unfortunately
you
remember
what
i
told
you
of
her
ungovernable
wild
fits
of
passion
which
she
expected
me
to
reciprocate
she
terrified
me
and
think
how
she
tortured
herself
with
baseless
in
the
last
years
of
her
life
kroll
yes
when
she
knew
that
she
would
always
be
childless
rosmer
well
think
what
it
meant
to
be
perpetually
in
the
clutches
of
such
agony
of
mind
over
a
thing
that
she
was
not
in
the
slightest
degree
responsible
for
are
you
going
to
suggest
that
she
was
accountable
for
her
actions
kroll
hm
do
you
remember
whether
at
that
time
you
had
in
the
house
any
books
dealing
with
the
purport
of
marriage
according
to
the
advanced
views
of
rosmer
i
remember
miss
west
lending
me
a
work
of
the
kind
she
inherited
west
library
you
know
but
my
dear
kroll
you
surely
do
not
suppose
that
we
were
so
imprudent
as
to
let
the
poor
sick
creature
get
wind
of
any
such
ideas
i
can
solemnly
swear
that
we
were
in
no
way
to
blame
it
was
the
overwrought
nerves
of
her
own
brain
that
were
responsible
for
these
frantic
aberrations
kroll
there
is
one
thing
at
any
rate
that
i
can
tell
you
now
and
that
is
that
your
poor
tortured
and
overwrought
beata
put
an
end
to
her
own
life
in
order
that
yours
might
be
happy
and
that
you
might
be
free
to
live
as
you
pleased
rosmer
starting
half
up
from
his
chair
what
do
you
mean
by
that
kroll
you
must
listen
to
me
quietly
rosmer
because
now
i
can
speak
of
it
during
the
last
year
of
her
life
she
came
twice
to
see
me
to
tell
me
what
she
suffered
from
her
fears
and
her
despair
rosmer
on
that
point
kroll
no
the
first
time
she
came
she
declared
that
you
were
on
the
high
road
to
apostasy
that
you
were
going
to
desert
the
faith
that
your
father
had
taught
you
rosmer
eagerly
what
you
say
is
impossible
kroll
absolutely
impossible
you
must
be
wrong
about
that
kroll
why
rosmer
because
as
long
as
beata
lived
i
was
still
doubting
and
fighting
with
myself
and
i
fought
out
that
fight
alone
and
in
the
completest
secrecy
i
do
not
imagine
that
even
rebecca
kroll
rebecca
rosmer
oh
well
miss
west
i
call
her
rebecca
for
the
sake
of
convenience
kroll
so
i
have
observed
rosmer
that
is
why
it
is
so
incomprehensible
to
me
that
beata
should
have
had
any
suspicion
of
it
why
did
she
never
speak
to
me
about
it
for
she
never
did
by
a
single
word
kroll
poor
soul
she
begged
and
implored
me
to
speak
to
you
rosmer
then
why
did
you
never
do
so
kroll
do
you
think
i
had
a
moment
doubt
at
that
time
that
her
mind
was
unhinged
such
an
accusation
as
that
against
a
man
like
you
well
she
came
to
see
me
again
about
a
month
later
she
seemed
calmer
then
but
as
she
was
going
away
she
said
they
may
expect
to
see
the
white
horse
soon
at
rosmersholm
rosmer
yes
i
know
the
white
horse
she
often
used
to
talk
about
that
kroll
and
then
when
i
tried
to
distract
her
from
such
unhappy
thoughts
she
only
answered
i
have
not
much
time
left
for
john
must
marry
rebecca
immediately
now
rosmer
almost
speechless
what
are
you
saying
i
marry
kroll
that
was
on
a
thursday
afternoon
on
the
saturday
evening
she
threw
herself
from
the
footbridge
into
the
millrace
rosmer
and
you
never
warned
us
kroll
well
you
know
yourself
how
constantly
she
used
to
say
that
she
was
sure
she
would
die
before
long
rosmer
yes
i
know
but
all
the
same
you
ought
to
have
warned
us
kroll
i
did
think
of
doing
so
but
then
it
was
too
late
rosmer
but
since
then
why
have
you
not
why
have
you
kept
all
this
to
yourself
kroll
what
good
would
it
have
done
for
me
to
come
here
and
add
to
your
pain
and
distress
of
course
i
thought
the
whole
thing
was
merely
wild
empty
fancy
until
yesterday
evening
rosmer
then
you
do
not
think
so
any
longer
kroll
did
not
beata
see
clearly
enough
when
she
saw
that
you
were
going
to
fall
away
from
your
childhood
faith
rosmer
staring
in
front
of
him
yes
i
can
not
understand
that
it
is
the
most
incomprehensible
thing
in
the
world
to
me
kroll
incomprehensible
or
not
the
thing
is
true
and
now
i
ask
you
rosmer
how
much
truth
is
there
in
her
other
accusation
the
last
one
i
mean
rosmer
accusation
was
that
an
accusation
then
kroll
perhaps
you
did
not
notice
how
it
was
worded
she
said
she
meant
to
stand
out
of
the
way
why
well
rosmer
in
order
that
i
might
marry
rebecca
apparently
kroll
that
was
not
quite
how
it
was
worded
beata
expressed
herself
differently
she
said
i
have
not
much
time
left
for
john
must
marry
rebecca
immediately
now
rosmer
looks
at
him
for
a
moment
then
gets
up
now
i
understand
you
kroll
kroll
and
if
you
do
what
answer
have
you
to
make
rosmer
in
an
even
voice
controlling
himself
to
such
an
the
only
fitting
answer
would
be
to
point
to
the
door
kroll
getting
up
very
good
rosmer
standing
face
to
face
with
him
listen
to
me
for
considerably
more
than
a
year
to
be
precise
since
beata
death
rebecca
west
and
i
have
lived
here
alone
at
rosmersholm
all
that
time
you
have
known
of
the
charge
beata
made
against
us
but
i
have
never
for
one
moment
seen
you
appear
the
least
scandalised
at
our
living
together
here
kroll
i
never
knew
till
yesterday
evening
that
it
was
a
case
of
an
apostate
man
and
an
emancipated
woman
living
together
rosmer
ah
so
then
you
do
not
believe
in
any
purity
of
life
among
apostates
or
emancipated
folk
you
do
not
believe
that
they
may
have
the
instinct
of
morality
ingrained
in
their
natures
kroll
i
have
no
particular
confidence
in
the
kind
of
morality
that
is
not
rooted
in
the
church
faith
rosmer
and
you
mean
that
to
apply
to
rebecca
and
myself
to
my
relations
with
rebecca
kroll
i
can
not
make
any
departure
in
favour
of
you
two
from
my
opinion
that
there
is
certainly
no
very
wide
gulf
between
free
thinking
and
ahem
rosmer
and
what
kroll
and
free
love
since
you
force
me
to
say
it
rosmer
gently
and
you
are
not
ashamed
to
say
that
to
me
you
who
have
known
me
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
kroll
it
is
just
for
that
reason
i
know
how
easily
you
allow
yourself
to
be
influenced
by
those
you
associate
with
and
as
for
your
rebecca
well
your
miss
west
then
to
tell
the
truth
we
know
very
little
about
her
to
cut
the
matter
short
rosmer
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
up
and
you
on
your
part
ought
to
try
and
save
yourself
in
time
rosmer
save
myself
how
helseth
looks
in
through
the
door
on
the
left
what
do
you
want
helseth
i
wanted
to
ask
miss
west
to
come
down
sir
rosmer
miss
west
is
not
up
here
helseth
indeed
sir
looks
round
the
room
that
is
very
strange
goes
out
rosmer
you
were
saying
kroll
listen
to
me
as
to
what
may
have
gone
on
here
in
secret
while
beata
was
alive
and
as
to
what
may
be
still
going
on
here
i
have
no
wish
to
inquire
more
closely
you
were
of
course
extremely
unhappy
in
your
marriage
and
to
some
extent
that
may
be
urged
in
your
excuse
rosmer
oh
how
little
you
really
know
me
kroll
do
not
interrupt
me
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
if
you
definitely
must
continue
living
with
miss
west
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
conceal
the
revolution
of
opinion
i
mean
the
distressing
apostasy
that
she
has
beguiled
you
into
let
me
speak
let
me
speak
i
say
that
if
you
are
determined
to
go
on
with
this
folly
for
heaven
sake
hold
any
variety
of
ideas
or
opinions
or
beliefs
you
like
but
keep
your
opinions
to
yourself
it
is
a
purely
personal
matter
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
necessity
to
go
proclaiming
it
all
over
the
countryside
rosmer
it
is
a
necessity
for
me
to
abandon
a
false
and
equivocal
position
kroll
but
you
have
a
duty
towards
the
traditions
of
your
family
rosmer
remember
that
from
time
immemorial
rosmersholm
has
been
a
stronghold
of
discipline
and
order
of
respect
and
esteem
for
all
that
the
best
people
in
our
community
have
upheld
and
sanctioned
the
whole
neighbourhood
has
taken
its
tone
from
rosmersholm
if
the
report
gets
about
that
you
yourself
have
broken
with
what
i
may
call
the
rosmer
family
tradition
it
will
evoke
an
irreparable
state
of
unrest
rosmer
my
dear
kroll
i
can
not
see
the
matter
in
that
light
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
my
imperative
duty
to
bring
a
little
light
and
happiness
into
the
place
where
the
race
of
rosmers
has
spread
darkness
and
oppression
for
all
these
long
years
kroll
looking
severely
at
him
yes
that
would
be
a
worthy
action
for
the
man
with
whom
the
race
will
disappear
let
such
things
alone
my
friend
it
is
no
suitable
task
for
you
you
were
meant
to
lead
the
peaceful
life
of
a
student
rosmer
yes
that
may
be
so
but
nevertheless
i
want
to
try
and
play
my
humble
part
in
the
struggles
of
life
kroll
the
struggles
of
life
do
you
know
what
that
will
mean
for
you
it
will
mean
war
to
the
death
with
all
your
friends
rosmer
quietly
i
do
not
imagine
they
are
all
such
fanatics
as
you
kroll
you
are
a
creature
rosmer
an
inexperienced
creature
you
have
no
suspicion
of
the
violence
of
the
storm
that
will
burst
upon
you
helseth
slightly
opens
the
door
on
the
left
helseth
miss
west
wishes
me
to
ask
you
sir
rosmer
what
is
it
helseth
there
is
some
one
downstairs
that
wishes
to
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
sir
rosmer
is
it
the
gentleman
that
was
here
yesterday
afternoon
by
any
chance
helseth
no
it
is
that
mortensgaard
rosmer
mortensgaard
kroll
aha
so
matters
have
got
as
far
as
that
already
have
they
rosmer
what
does
he
want
with
me
why
did
you
not
send
him
away
helseth
miss
west
told
me
to
ask
you
if
he
might
come
up
rosmer
tell
him
i
am
engaged
and
kroll
to
helseth
no
show
him
up
please
helseth
goes
out
kroll
takes
up
his
hat
i
quit
the
field
temporarily
but
we
have
not
fought
the
decisive
action
yet
rosmer
as
truly
as
i
stand
here
kroll
i
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
mortensgaard
kroll
i
do
not
believe
you
any
longer
on
any
point
under
no
circumstances
shall
i
have
any
faith
in
you
after
this
it
is
war
to
the
knife
now
we
shall
try
if
we
can
not
make
you
powerless
to
do
any
harm
rosmer
oh
kroll
how
you
have
sunk
how
low
you
have
sunk
kroll
i
and
a
man
like
you
has
the
face
to
say
so
remember
beata
rosmer
are
you
harking
back
to
that
again
kroll
no
you
must
solve
the
riddle
of
the
millrace
as
your
conscience
will
allow
you
if
you
have
any
conscience
still
left
peter
mortensgaard
comes
in
softly
and
quietly
by
the
door
on
the
left
he
is
a
short
slightly
built
man
with
sparse
reddish
hair
and
beard
kroll
gives
him
a
look
of
hatred
the
searchlight
too
i
see
lighted
at
rosmersholm
buttons
up
his
coat
that
leaves
me
no
doubt
as
to
the
course
i
should
steer
mortensgaard
quietly
the
searchlight
will
always
be
ready
burning
to
light
kroll
home
kroll
yes
you
have
shown
me
your
goodwill
for
a
long
time
to
be
sure
there
is
a
commandment
that
forbids
us
to
bear
false
witness
against
our
neighbour
mortensgaard
kroll
has
no
need
to
instruct
me
in
the
commandments
kroll
not
even
in
the
sixth
rosmer
kroll
mortensgaard
if
i
needed
such
instruction
rosmer
is
the
most
suitable
person
to
give
it
me
kroll
with
scarcely
concealed
scorn
rosmer
oh
yes
the
reverend
rosmer
is
undoubtedly
the
most
suitable
man
for
that
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourselves
gentlemen
goes
out
and
slams
the
door
after
him
rosmer
stands
looking
at
the
door
and
says
to
himself
yes
yes
it
had
to
be
so
turns
round
will
you
tell
me
mortensgaard
what
has
brought
you
out
here
to
see
me
mortensgaard
it
was
really
miss
west
i
wanted
to
see
i
thought
i
ought
to
thank
her
for
the
kind
letter
i
received
from
her
yesterday
rosmer
i
know
she
has
written
to
you
have
you
had
a
talk
with
her
mortensgaard
yes
a
little
smiles
slightly
i
hear
that
there
has
been
a
change
of
views
in
certain
respects
at
rosmersholm
rosmer
my
views
have
changed
to
a
very
considerable
extent
i
might
almost
say
entirely
mortensgaard
that
is
what
miss
west
said
and
that
was
why
she
thought
i
ought
to
come
up
and
have
a
little
chat
with
you
about
this
rosmer
about
what
mortensgaard
mortensgaard
may
i
have
your
permission
to
announce
in
the
searchlight
that
you
have
altered
your
opinions
and
are
going
to
devote
yourself
to
the
cause
of
free
thought
and
progress
rosmer
by
all
means
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
ask
you
to
make
the
announcement
mortensgaard
then
it
shall
appear
it
will
be
a
great
and
weighty
piece
of
news
that
the
reverend
rosmer
of
rosmersholm
has
made
up
his
mind
to
join
the
forces
of
light
in
that
direction
too
rosmer
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
mortensgaard
what
i
mean
is
that
it
implies
the
gain
of
strong
moral
support
for
our
party
every
time
we
win
over
an
earnest
adherent
rosmer
with
some
astonishment
then
you
do
know
did
miss
west
not
tell
you
that
as
well
mortensgaard
what
rosmer
miss
west
was
in
a
considerable
hurry
she
told
me
to
come
up
and
that
i
would
hear
the
rest
of
it
from
yourself
rosmer
very
well
then
let
me
tell
you
that
i
have
cut
myself
free
entirely
on
every
side
i
have
now
no
connection
of
any
kind
with
the
tenets
of
the
church
for
the
future
such
matters
have
not
the
smallest
signification
for
me
mortensgaard
looking
at
him
in
perplexity
well
if
the
moon
had
fallen
down
from
the
sky
i
could
not
be
more
to
think
that
i
should
ever
hear
you
yourself
renounce
rosmer
yes
i
stand
now
where
you
have
stood
for
a
long
time
you
can
announce
that
in
the
searchlight
too
mortensgaard
that
too
no
my
dear
rosmer
you
must
excuse
me
but
it
is
not
worth
touching
on
that
side
of
the
matter
rosmer
not
touch
on
it
mortensgaard
not
at
first
i
think
rosmer
but
i
do
not
understand
mortensgaard
well
it
is
like
this
rosmer
you
are
not
as
familiar
with
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
as
i
am
i
expect
but
if
you
too
have
joined
the
forces
of
freedom
and
if
you
as
miss
west
says
you
do
mean
to
take
part
in
the
movement
i
conclude
you
do
so
with
the
desire
to
be
as
useful
to
the
movement
as
you
possibly
can
in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory
rosmer
yes
that
is
my
most
sincere
wish
mortensgaard
very
well
but
i
must
impress
on
you
rosmer
that
if
you
come
forward
openly
with
this
news
about
your
defection
from
the
church
you
will
tie
your
own
hands
immediately
rosmer
do
you
think
so
mortensgaard
yes
you
may
be
certain
that
there
is
not
much
that
you
would
be
able
to
do
hereabouts
and
besides
rosmer
we
have
quite
enough
freethinkers
already
indeed
i
was
going
to
say
we
have
too
many
of
those
gentry
what
the
party
needs
is
a
christian
element
something
that
every
one
must
respect
that
is
what
we
want
badly
and
for
that
reason
it
is
most
advisable
that
you
should
hold
your
tongue
about
any
matters
that
do
not
concern
the
public
that
is
my
opinion
rosmer
i
see
then
you
would
not
risk
having
anything
to
do
with
me
if
i
were
to
confess
my
apostasy
openly
mortensgaard
shaking
his
head
i
should
not
like
to
rosmer
lately
i
have
made
it
a
rule
never
to
support
anybody
or
anything
that
is
opposed
to
the
interests
of
the
church
rosmer
have
you
then
entered
the
fold
of
the
church
again
lately
mortensgaard
that
is
another
matter
altogether
rosmer
oh
that
is
how
it
is
yes
i
understand
you
now
mortensgaard
rosmer
you
ought
to
remember
that
i
of
all
people
have
not
absolute
freedom
of
action
rosmer
what
hampers
you
mortensgaard
what
hampers
me
is
that
i
am
a
marked
man
rosmer
ah
of
course
mortensgaard
a
marked
man
rosmer
and
you
of
all
people
ought
to
remember
that
because
you
were
responsible
more
than
any
one
else
for
my
being
branded
rosmer
if
i
had
stood
then
where
i
stand
now
i
should
have
handled
the
affair
more
judiciously
mortensgaard
i
think
so
too
but
it
is
too
late
now
you
have
branded
me
once
for
all
branded
me
for
life
i
do
not
suppose
you
can
fully
realise
what
such
a
thing
means
but
it
is
possible
that
you
may
soon
feel
the
smart
of
it
yourself
now
rosmer
rosmer
i
mortensgaard
yes
you
surely
do
not
suppose
that
kroll
and
his
gang
will
be
inclined
to
forgive
a
rupture
such
as
yours
and
the
county
news
is
going
to
be
pretty
bloodthirsty
i
hear
it
may
very
well
come
to
pass
that
you
will
be
a
marked
man
too
rosmer
on
personal
grounds
mortensgaard
i
feel
myself
to
be
invulnerable
my
conduct
does
not
offer
any
point
of
attack
mortensgaard
with
a
quiet
smile
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
rosmer
rosmer
perhaps
it
is
but
i
have
the
right
to
say
as
much
mortensgaard
even
if
you
were
inclined
to
overhaul
your
conduct
as
thoroughly
as
you
once
overhauled
mine
rosmer
you
say
that
very
strangely
what
are
you
driving
at
is
it
anything
definite
mortensgaard
yes
there
is
one
definite
thing
no
more
than
a
single
one
but
it
might
be
quite
awkward
enough
if
malicious
opponents
got
a
hint
of
it
rosmer
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
tell
me
what
on
earth
it
is
mortensgaard
can
you
not
guess
rosmer
rosmer
no
not
for
a
moment
mortensgaard
all
right
i
must
come
out
with
it
then
i
have
in
my
possession
a
remarkable
letter
that
was
written
here
at
rosmersholm
rosmer
miss
west
letter
you
mean
is
it
so
remarkable
mortensgaard
no
that
letter
is
not
remarkable
but
i
received
a
letter
from
this
house
on
another
occasion
rosmer
from
miss
west
mortensgaard
no
rosmer
rosmer
well
from
whom
then
from
whom
mortensgaard
from
your
late
wife
rosmer
from
my
wife
you
had
a
letter
from
my
wife
mortensgaard
yes
i
did
rosmer
when
mortensgaard
it
was
during
the
poor
lady
last
days
it
must
be
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
now
and
that
is
the
letter
that
is
so
remarkable
rosmer
surely
you
know
that
my
wife
mind
was
affected
at
that
time
mortensgaard
i
know
there
were
a
great
many
people
who
thought
so
but
in
my
opinion
no
one
would
have
imagined
anything
of
the
kind
from
the
letter
when
i
say
the
letter
is
a
remarkable
one
i
mean
remarkable
in
quite
another
way
rosmer
and
what
in
the
world
did
my
poor
wife
find
to
write
to
you
about
mortensgaard
i
have
the
letter
at
home
it
begins
more
or
less
to
the
effect
that
she
is
living
in
perpetual
terror
and
dread
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
so
many
evilly
disposed
people
about
her
whose
only
desire
is
to
do
you
harm
and
mischief
rosmer
me
mortensgaard
yes
so
she
says
and
then
follows
the
most
remarkable
part
of
it
all
shall
i
tell
you
rosmer
rosmer
of
course
tell
me
everything
without
any
reserve
mortensgaard
the
poor
lady
begs
and
entreats
me
to
be
magnanimous
she
says
that
she
knows
it
was
you
who
got
me
dismissed
from
my
post
as
schoolmaster
and
implores
me
most
earnestly
not
to
revenge
myself
upon
you
rosmer
what
way
did
she
think
you
could
revenge
yourself
then
mortensgaard
the
letter
goes
on
to
say
that
if
i
should
hear
that
anything
sinful
was
going
on
at
rosmersholm
i
was
not
to
believe
a
word
of
it
that
it
would
be
only
the
work
of
wicked
folk
who
were
spreading
the
rumours
on
purpose
to
do
you
harm
rosmer
does
the
letter
say
that
mortensgaard
you
may
read
it
at
your
convenience
rosmer
rosmer
but
i
can
not
understand
what
did
she
imagine
there
could
be
any
wicked
rumours
about
mortensgaard
in
the
first
place
that
you
had
broken
away
from
the
faith
of
your
childhood
rosmer
denied
that
absolutely
at
that
time
and
in
the
next
place
ahem
rosmer
in
the
next
place
mortensgaard
well
in
the
next
place
she
writes
though
rather
confusedly
that
she
has
no
knowledge
of
any
sinful
relations
existing
at
rosmersholm
that
she
has
never
been
wronged
in
any
way
and
that
if
any
rumours
of
that
sort
should
get
about
she
entreats
me
not
to
allude
to
them
in
the
searchlight
rosmer
does
she
mention
any
names
mortensgaard
no
rosmer
who
brought
you
the
letter
mortensgaard
i
promised
not
to
tell
that
it
was
brought
to
me
one
evening
after
dark
rosmer
if
you
had
made
inquiries
at
the
time
you
would
have
learnt
that
my
poor
unhappy
wife
was
not
fully
accountable
for
her
actions
mortensgaard
i
did
make
inquiries
rosmer
but
i
must
say
i
did
not
get
exactly
that
impression
rosmer
not
but
why
have
you
chosen
this
moment
to
enlighten
me
as
to
the
existence
of
this
old
crazy
letter
mortensgaard
with
the
object
of
advising
you
to
be
extremely
cautious
rosmer
rosmer
as
to
my
way
of
life
do
you
mean
mortensgaard
yes
you
must
remember
that
for
the
future
you
will
not
be
unassailable
rosmer
so
you
persist
in
thinking
that
i
have
something
to
conceal
here
mortensgaard
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
a
man
of
emancipated
ideas
should
refrain
from
living
his
life
as
fully
as
possible
only
as
i
have
already
said
you
should
be
cautious
in
future
if
rumours
should
get
about
of
anything
that
offends
people
prejudices
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
the
whole
cause
of
freedom
of
thought
will
suffer
for
it
rosmer
rosmer
mortensgaard
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
now
and
have
the
great
piece
of
news
inserted
in
the
searchlight
rosmer
put
it
all
in
mortensgaard
i
will
put
in
as
much
as
there
is
any
need
for
the
public
to
know
bows
and
goes
out
rosmer
stands
at
the
door
while
mortensgaard
goes
downstairs
the
front
door
is
heard
shutting
rosmer
still
standing
in
the
doorway
calls
softly
rebecca
reb
ahem
calls
loudly
helseth
is
miss
west
downstairs
helseth
from
below
no
sir
she
is
not
here
the
curtain
at
the
end
of
the
room
is
drawn
back
disclosing
rebecca
standing
in
the
doorway
rebecca
john
rosmer
turning
round
what
were
you
in
there
in
my
bedroom
my
dear
what
were
you
doing
there
rebecca
going
up
to
him
i
have
been
listening
rosmer
rebecca
could
you
do
a
thing
like
that
rebecca
indeed
i
could
it
was
so
horrid
the
way
he
said
that
about
my
morning
wrapper
rosmer
ah
so
you
were
in
there
too
when
kroll
rebecca
yes
i
wanted
to
know
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
mind
rosmer
you
know
i
would
have
told
you
rebecca
i
scarcely
think
you
would
have
told
me
everything
certainly
not
in
his
own
words
rosmer
did
you
hear
everything
then
rebecca
most
of
it
i
think
i
had
to
go
down
for
a
moment
when
mortensgaard
came
rosmer
and
then
came
up
again
rebecca
do
not
take
it
ill
of
me
dear
friend
rosmer
do
anything
that
you
think
right
and
proper
you
have
full
freedom
of
but
what
do
you
say
to
it
all
rebecca
ah
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
stood
so
much
in
need
of
you
as
i
do
rebecca
surely
both
you
and
i
have
been
prepared
for
what
would
happen
some
day
rosmer
no
no
not
for
this
rebecca
not
for
this
rosmer
it
is
true
that
i
used
to
think
that
sooner
or
later
our
beautiful
pure
friendship
would
come
to
be
attacked
by
calumny
and
suspicion
not
on
kroll
part
for
i
never
would
have
believed
such
a
thing
of
him
but
on
the
part
of
the
and
crowd
yes
indeed
i
had
good
reason
enough
for
so
jealously
drawing
a
veil
of
concealment
over
our
compact
it
was
a
dangerous
secret
rebecca
why
should
we
pay
any
heed
to
what
all
these
other
people
think
you
and
i
know
that
we
have
nothing
to
reproach
ourselves
with
rosmer
i
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
it
is
true
enough
that
i
thought
so
until
but
now
now
rebecca
rebecca
yes
now
rosmer
how
am
i
to
account
to
myself
for
beata
horrible
accusation
rebecca
impetuously
oh
do
talk
about
beata
do
think
about
beata
any
more
she
is
dead
and
you
seemed
at
last
to
have
been
able
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
her
rosmer
since
i
have
learnt
of
this
it
seems
just
as
if
she
had
come
to
life
again
in
some
uncanny
fashion
rebecca
oh
no
you
must
not
say
that
john
you
must
not
rosmer
i
tell
you
it
is
so
we
must
try
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
how
can
she
have
strayed
into
such
a
woeful
misunderstanding
of
me
rebecca
surely
you
too
are
not
beginning
to
doubt
that
she
was
very
nearly
insane
rosmer
well
i
can
not
deny
it
is
just
of
that
fact
that
i
feel
i
can
not
be
so
altogether
certain
any
longer
and
besides
if
it
were
so
rebecca
if
it
were
so
what
then
rosmer
what
i
mean
is
where
are
we
to
look
for
the
actual
cause
of
her
sick
woman
fancies
turning
into
insanity
rebecca
what
good
can
it
possibly
do
for
you
to
indulge
in
such
speculations
rosmer
i
can
not
do
otherwise
rebecca
i
can
not
let
this
doubt
go
on
gnawing
at
my
heart
however
unwilling
i
may
be
to
face
it
rebecca
but
it
may
become
a
real
danger
to
you
to
be
perpetually
dwelling
on
this
one
lugubrious
topic
rosmer
walking
about
restlessly
and
absorbed
in
the
idea
i
must
have
betrayed
myself
in
some
way
or
other
she
must
have
noticed
how
happy
i
began
to
feel
from
the
day
you
came
to
us
rebecca
yes
but
dear
even
if
that
were
so
rosmer
you
may
be
sure
she
did
not
fail
to
notice
that
we
read
the
same
books
that
we
sought
one
another
company
and
discussed
every
new
topic
together
but
i
can
not
understand
it
because
i
was
always
so
careful
to
spare
her
when
i
look
back
it
seems
to
me
that
i
did
everything
i
could
to
keep
her
apart
from
our
lives
or
did
i
not
rebecca
rebecca
yes
yes
undoubtedly
you
did
rosmer
and
so
did
you
too
and
notwithstanding
that
oh
it
is
horrible
to
think
of
to
think
that
here
she
was
with
her
affection
all
distorted
by
illness
never
saying
a
word
watching
us
noticing
everything
and
and
misconstruing
everything
rebecca
wringing
her
hands
oh
i
never
ought
to
have
come
to
rosmersholm
rosmer
just
think
what
she
must
have
suffered
in
silence
think
of
all
the
horrible
things
her
poor
diseased
brain
must
have
led
her
to
believe
about
us
and
store
up
in
her
mind
about
us
did
she
never
speak
to
you
of
anything
that
could
give
you
any
kind
of
clue
rebecca
as
if
startled
to
me
do
you
suppose
i
should
have
remained
here
a
day
longer
if
she
had
rosmer
no
no
that
is
obvious
what
a
fight
she
must
have
fought
and
fought
alone
rebecca
in
despair
and
all
alone
and
then
in
the
end
the
poignant
misery
of
her
victory
which
was
also
her
accusation
of
us
in
the
throws
himself
into
a
chair
rests
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
hides
his
face
in
his
hands
rebecca
coming
quietly
up
behind
him
listen
to
me
john
if
it
were
in
your
power
to
call
beata
back
to
you
to
rosmersholm
would
you
do
it
rosmer
how
can
i
tell
what
i
would
do
or
what
i
would
not
do
i
have
no
thoughts
for
anything
but
the
one
thing
which
is
irrevocable
rebecca
you
ought
to
be
beginning
to
live
now
john
you
were
beginning
you
had
freed
yourself
completely
on
all
sides
you
were
feeling
so
happy
and
so
rosmer
i
know
that
is
true
enough
and
then
comes
this
overwhelming
blow
rebecca
standing
behind
him
with
her
arms
on
the
back
of
his
chair
how
beautiful
it
was
when
we
used
to
sit
there
downstairs
in
the
dusk
and
helped
each
other
to
plan
our
lives
out
afresh
you
wanted
to
catch
hold
of
actual
life
the
actual
life
of
the
day
as
you
used
to
say
you
wanted
to
pass
from
house
to
house
like
a
guest
who
brought
emancipation
with
him
to
win
over
men
thoughts
and
wills
to
your
own
to
fashion
noble
men
all
around
you
in
a
wider
and
wider
circle
noble
men
rosmer
noble
men
and
happy
men
rebecca
yes
happy
men
rosmer
because
it
is
happiness
that
gives
the
soul
nobility
rebecca
rebecca
do
you
not
think
suffering
too
the
deepest
suffering
rosmer
yes
if
one
can
win
through
it
conquer
it
conquer
it
completely
rebecca
that
is
what
you
must
do
rosmer
shaking
his
head
sadly
i
shall
never
conquer
this
completely
there
will
always
be
a
doubt
confronting
me
a
question
i
shall
never
again
be
able
to
lose
myself
in
the
enjoyment
of
what
makes
life
so
wonderfully
beautiful
rebecca
speaking
over
the
back
of
his
chair
softly
what
do
you
mean
john
rosmer
looking
up
at
her
calm
and
happy
innocence
rebecca
taking
a
step
backwards
of
course
innocence
a
short
silence
rosmer
resting
his
head
on
his
hands
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
how
ingeniously
how
systematically
she
must
have
put
one
thing
together
with
another
first
of
all
she
begins
to
have
a
suspicion
as
to
my
orthodoxy
how
on
earth
did
she
get
that
idea
in
her
mind
any
way
she
did
and
the
idea
grew
into
a
certainty
and
then
then
of
course
it
was
easy
for
her
to
think
everything
else
possible
sits
up
in
his
chair
and
runs
his
hands
through
his
hair
the
wild
fancies
i
am
haunted
with
i
shall
never
get
quit
of
them
i
am
certain
of
that
certain
they
will
always
be
starting
up
before
me
to
remind
me
of
the
dead
rebecca
like
the
white
horse
of
rosmersholm
rosmer
yes
like
that
rushing
at
me
out
of
the
dark
out
of
the
silence
rebecca
and
because
of
this
morbid
fancy
of
yours
you
are
going
to
give
up
the
hold
you
had
just
gained
upon
real
life
rosmer
you
are
right
it
seems
hard
hard
rebecca
but
i
have
no
power
of
choice
in
the
matter
how
do
you
think
i
could
ever
get
the
mastery
over
it
rebecca
standing
behind
his
chair
by
making
new
ties
for
yourself
rosmer
starts
and
looks
up
new
ties
rebecca
yes
new
ties
with
the
outside
world
live
work
do
something
do
not
sit
here
musing
and
brooding
over
insoluble
conundrums
rosmer
getting
up
new
ties
walks
across
the
room
turns
at
the
door
and
comes
back
again
a
question
occurs
to
my
mind
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
too
rebecca
rebecca
catching
her
breath
let
me
hear
what
it
is
rosmer
what
do
you
suppose
will
become
of
the
tie
between
us
after
rebecca
i
think
surely
our
friendship
can
endure
come
what
may
rosmer
yes
but
that
is
not
exactly
what
i
meant
i
was
thinking
of
what
brought
us
together
from
the
first
what
links
us
so
closely
to
one
another
our
common
belief
in
the
possibility
of
a
man
and
a
woman
living
together
in
chastity
rebecca
yes
yes
what
of
it
rosmer
what
i
mean
is
does
not
such
a
tie
as
that
such
a
tie
as
ours
seem
to
belong
properly
to
a
life
lived
in
quiet
happy
peacefulness
rebecca
well
rosmer
but
now
i
see
stretching
before
me
a
life
of
strife
and
unrest
and
violent
emotions
for
i
mean
to
live
my
life
rebecca
i
am
not
going
to
let
myself
be
beaten
to
the
ground
by
the
dread
of
what
may
happen
i
am
not
going
to
have
my
course
of
life
prescribed
for
me
either
by
any
living
soul
or
by
another
rebecca
no
no
do
not
be
a
free
man
in
everything
john
rosmer
do
you
understand
what
is
in
my
mind
then
do
you
not
know
do
you
not
see
how
i
could
best
win
my
freedom
from
all
these
harrowing
memories
from
the
whole
sad
past
rebecca
tell
me
rosmer
by
setting
up
in
opposition
to
them
a
new
and
living
reality
rebecca
feeling
for
the
back
of
the
chair
a
living
what
do
you
mean
rosmer
coming
closer
to
her
rebecca
suppose
i
asked
you
now
will
you
be
my
second
wife
rebecca
is
speechless
for
a
moment
then
gives
a
cry
of
joy
your
wife
yours
i
rosmer
yes
let
us
try
what
that
will
do
we
two
shall
be
one
there
must
no
longer
be
any
empty
place
left
by
the
dead
in
this
house
rebecca
i
in
beata
place
rosmer
and
then
that
chapter
of
my
life
will
be
closed
completely
closed
never
to
be
reopened
rebecca
in
a
low
trembling
voice
do
you
think
so
john
rosmer
it
must
be
so
it
must
i
can
not
i
will
not
go
through
life
with
a
dead
body
on
my
back
help
me
to
throw
it
off
rebecca
and
then
let
us
stifle
all
memories
in
our
sense
of
freedom
in
joy
in
passion
you
shall
be
to
me
the
only
wife
i
have
ever
had
rebecca
controlling
herself
never
speak
of
this
again
i
will
never
be
your
wife
rosmer
what
never
do
you
think
then
that
you
could
not
learn
to
love
me
is
not
our
friendship
already
tinged
with
love
rebecca
stopping
her
ears
as
if
in
fear
do
speak
like
that
john
do
say
such
things
rosmer
catching
her
by
the
arm
it
is
true
there
is
a
growing
possibility
in
the
tie
that
is
between
us
i
can
see
that
you
feel
that
as
well
as
i
do
you
not
rebecca
rebecca
controlling
herself
completely
listen
let
me
tell
you
this
if
you
persist
in
this
i
shall
leave
rosmersholm
rosmer
leave
rosmersholm
you
you
can
not
do
that
it
is
impossible
rebecca
it
is
still
more
impossible
for
me
to
become
your
wife
never
as
long
as
i
live
can
i
be
that
rosmer
looks
at
her
in
surprise
you
say
can
and
you
say
it
so
strangely
why
can
you
not
rebecca
taking
both
his
hands
in
hers
dear
friend
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
do
not
ask
me
why
lets
go
of
his
hands
so
john
goes
towards
the
door
on
the
left
rosmer
for
the
future
the
world
will
hold
only
one
question
for
me
why
rebecca
turns
and
looks
at
him
in
that
case
everything
is
at
an
end
rosmer
between
you
and
me
rebecca
yes
rosmer
things
can
never
be
at
an
end
between
us
two
you
shall
never
leave
rosmersholm
rebecca
with
her
hand
on
the
no
i
dare
say
i
shall
not
but
all
the
same
if
you
question
me
again
it
will
mean
the
end
of
everything
rosmer
the
end
of
everything
all
the
same
how
rebecca
because
then
i
shall
go
the
way
beata
went
now
you
know
john
rosmer
rebecca
rebecca
stops
at
the
door
and
nods
slowly
now
you
know
goes
out
rosmer
stares
in
bewilderment
at
the
shut
door
and
says
to
himself
what
can
it
mean
act
iii
scene
the
at
rosmersholm
the
window
and
the
are
open
the
morning
sun
is
seen
shining
outside
rebecca
dressed
as
in
act
is
standing
by
the
window
watering
and
arranging
the
flowers
her
work
is
lying
on
the
armchair
helseth
is
going
round
the
room
with
a
feather
brush
dusting
the
furniture
rebecca
after
a
short
pause
i
wonder
why
rosmer
is
so
late
in
coming
down
helseth
oh
he
is
often
as
late
as
this
miss
he
is
sure
to
be
down
directly
rebecca
have
you
seen
anything
of
him
helseth
no
miss
except
that
as
i
took
his
coffee
into
his
study
he
went
into
his
bedroom
to
finish
dressing
rebecca
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
he
was
not
very
well
yesterday
helseth
no
he
did
not
look
well
it
made
me
wonder
whether
something
had
gone
amiss
between
him
and
his
rebecca
what
do
you
suppose
could
go
amiss
between
them
helseth
i
ca
say
miss
perhaps
it
was
that
fellow
mortensgaard
set
them
at
loggerheads
rebecca
it
is
quite
possible
do
you
know
anything
of
this
peter
mortensgaard
helseth
not
i
how
could
you
think
so
miss
a
man
like
that
rebecca
because
of
that
horrid
paper
he
edits
you
mean
helseth
not
only
because
of
that
miss
i
suppose
you
have
heard
that
a
certain
married
woman
whose
husband
had
deserted
her
had
a
child
by
him
rebecca
i
have
heard
it
but
of
course
that
was
long
before
i
came
here
helseth
bless
me
yes
he
was
quite
a
young
man
then
but
she
might
have
had
more
sense
than
he
had
he
wanted
to
marry
her
too
but
that
could
not
be
done
and
so
he
had
to
pay
heavily
for
it
but
since
then
my
word
mortensgaard
has
risen
in
the
world
there
are
lots
of
people
who
run
after
him
now
rebecca
i
believe
most
of
the
poor
people
turn
to
him
first
when
they
are
in
any
trouble
helseth
oh
not
only
the
poor
people
miss
rebecca
glancing
at
her
unobserved
indeed
helseth
standing
at
the
sofa
dusting
vigorously
people
you
would
least
expect
sometimes
miss
rebecca
arranging
the
flowers
yes
but
that
is
only
an
idea
of
yours
helseth
you
can
not
know
that
for
certain
helseth
you
think
i
do
know
anything
about
that
for
certain
do
you
miss
indeed
i
do
because
if
i
must
let
out
the
secret
at
last
i
carried
a
letter
to
mortensgaard
myself
once
rebecca
turns
round
no
did
you
helseth
yes
that
i
did
and
that
letter
let
me
tell
you
was
written
here
at
rosmersholm
rebecca
really
helseth
helseth
i
give
you
my
word
it
was
miss
and
it
was
written
on
good
and
sealed
with
beautiful
red
rebecca
and
you
were
entrusted
with
the
delivery
of
it
dear
helseth
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
guess
whom
it
was
from
helseth
who
then
rebecca
naturally
it
was
something
that
poor
rosmer
in
her
invalid
state
helseth
well
you
have
mentioned
her
name
miss
not
rebecca
but
what
was
in
the
letter
no
of
course
you
can
not
know
that
helseth
hm
it
is
just
possible
i
may
know
all
the
same
rebecca
did
she
tell
you
what
she
was
writing
about
then
helseth
no
she
did
not
do
that
but
when
mortensgaard
had
read
it
he
set
to
work
and
me
so
that
i
got
a
very
good
idea
of
what
was
in
it
rebecca
what
do
you
think
was
in
it
then
oh
dear
good
helseth
do
tell
me
helseth
certainly
not
miss
not
for
worlds
rebecca
oh
you
can
tell
me
you
and
i
are
such
friends
you
know
helseth
heaven
forbid
i
should
tell
you
anything
about
that
miss
i
shall
not
tell
you
anything
except
that
it
was
some
dreadful
idea
that
they
had
gone
and
put
into
my
poor
sick
mistress
head
rebecca
who
had
put
it
into
her
head
helseth
wicked
people
miss
wicked
people
rebecca
wicked
helseth
yes
i
say
it
again
very
wicked
people
they
must
have
been
rebecca
and
what
do
you
think
it
could
be
helseth
oh
i
know
what
i
think
but
please
heaven
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
certain
lady
in
the
town
hm
rebecca
i
can
see
you
mean
kroll
helseth
yes
she
is
a
queer
one
she
is
she
has
always
been
very
much
on
the
high
horse
with
me
and
she
has
never
looked
with
any
friendly
eye
on
you
either
miss
rebecca
do
you
think
rosmer
was
quite
in
her
right
mind
when
she
wrote
that
letter
to
mortensgaard
helseth
it
is
so
difficult
to
tell
miss
i
certainly
do
think
she
was
quite
out
of
her
mind
rebecca
but
you
know
she
seemed
to
go
quite
distracted
when
she
learnt
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
have
a
child
that
was
when
her
madness
first
showed
itself
helseth
yes
that
had
a
terrible
effect
on
her
poor
lady
rebecca
taking
up
her
work
and
sitting
down
on
a
chair
by
the
window
but
in
other
respects
do
you
not
think
that
was
really
a
good
thing
for
rosmer
helseth
helseth
what
miss
rebecca
that
there
were
no
children
helseth
hm
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
that
rebecca
believe
me
it
was
best
for
him
rosmer
was
never
meant
to
be
surrounded
by
crying
children
helseth
little
children
do
not
cry
at
rosmersholm
miss
west
rebecca
looking
at
her
not
cry
helseth
no
in
this
house
little
children
have
never
been
known
to
cry
as
long
as
any
one
can
remember
rebecca
that
is
very
strange
helseth
yes
is
it
miss
but
it
runs
in
the
family
and
there
is
another
thing
that
is
just
as
strange
when
they
grow
up
they
never
laugh
never
laugh
all
their
lives
rebecca
but
that
would
be
extraordinary
helseth
have
you
ever
once
heard
or
seen
rosmer
laugh
miss
rebecca
no
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
almost
believe
you
are
right
but
i
fancy
most
of
the
folk
hereabouts
laugh
very
little
helseth
that
is
quite
true
people
say
it
began
at
rosmersholm
and
i
expect
it
spread
like
a
sort
of
infection
rebecca
you
are
a
sagacious
woman
helseth
helseth
oh
you
must
sit
there
and
make
game
of
me
miss
listens
hush
hush
rosmer
is
coming
down
he
does
like
to
see
brooms
about
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
right
rosmer
with
his
stick
and
hat
in
his
hand
comes
in
from
the
lobby
rosmer
rebecca
rebecca
dear
she
goes
on
working
for
a
little
while
in
silence
are
you
going
out
rosmer
yes
rebecca
it
is
such
a
lovely
day
rosmer
you
did
not
come
up
to
see
me
this
morning
rebecca
no
i
did
not
rosmer
do
you
mean
to
do
so
in
future
either
rebecca
i
can
not
say
yet
dear
rosmer
has
anything
come
for
me
rebecca
the
county
news
has
come
rosmer
the
county
news
rebecca
there
it
is
on
the
table
rosmer
putting
down
his
hat
and
stick
is
there
anything
rebecca
yes
rosmer
and
you
did
not
send
it
up
to
me
rebecca
you
will
read
it
quite
soon
enough
rosmer
well
let
us
see
takes
up
the
paper
and
stands
by
the
table
reading
it
what
can
not
pronounce
too
emphatic
a
warning
against
unprincipled
deserters
looks
at
her
they
call
me
a
deserter
rebecca
rebecca
they
mention
no
names
at
all
rosmer
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
goes
on
reading
secret
traitors
to
the
good
cause
creatures
who
shamelessly
confess
their
apostasy
as
soon
as
they
think
the
most
opportune
and
most
profitable
moment
has
arrived
a
reckless
outrage
on
the
fair
fame
of
honoured
ancestors
in
the
expectation
that
those
who
are
enjoying
a
brief
spell
of
authority
will
not
disappoint
them
of
a
suitable
reward
lays
the
paper
down
on
the
table
and
they
write
that
of
me
these
men
who
have
known
me
so
long
and
so
intimately
write
a
thing
that
they
do
not
even
believe
themselves
they
know
there
is
not
a
single
word
of
truth
in
it
and
yet
they
write
it
rebecca
there
is
more
of
it
yet
rosmer
taking
up
the
paper
again
make
some
allowance
for
inexperience
and
want
of
judgment
a
pernicious
influence
which
very
possibly
has
extended
even
to
matters
which
for
the
present
we
will
refrain
from
publicly
discussing
or
condemning
looks
at
her
what
does
that
mean
rebecca
that
is
a
hit
at
me
obviously
rosmer
laying
down
the
paper
rebecca
this
is
the
conduct
of
dishonourable
men
rebecca
yes
it
seems
to
me
they
have
no
right
to
talk
about
mortensgaard
rosmer
walking
up
and
down
the
room
they
must
be
saved
from
this
sort
of
thing
all
the
good
that
is
in
men
is
destroyed
if
it
is
allowed
to
go
on
but
it
shall
not
be
so
how
happy
how
happy
i
should
feel
if
i
could
succeed
in
bringing
a
little
light
into
all
this
murky
ugliness
rebecca
getting
up
i
am
sure
of
it
there
is
something
great
something
splendid
for
you
to
live
for
rosmer
just
think
of
it
if
i
could
wake
them
to
a
real
knowledge
of
themselves
bring
them
to
be
angry
with
and
ashamed
of
themselves
induce
them
to
be
at
one
with
each
other
in
toleration
in
love
rebecca
rebecca
yes
give
yourself
up
entirely
to
that
task
and
you
will
see
that
you
will
succeed
rosmer
i
think
it
might
be
done
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
live
one
life
then
no
more
hateful
strife
only
emulation
every
eye
fixed
on
the
same
goal
every
man
will
every
man
thoughts
moving
each
in
its
own
inevitable
path
happiness
for
all
and
through
the
efforts
of
all
looks
out
of
the
window
as
he
speaks
then
gives
a
start
and
says
gloomily
ah
not
through
me
rebecca
not
not
through
you
rosmer
nor
for
me
either
rebecca
oh
john
have
no
such
doubts
rosmer
happiness
dear
rebecca
means
first
and
foremost
the
calm
joyous
sense
of
innocence
rebecca
staring
in
front
of
her
ah
innocence
rosmer
you
need
fear
nothing
on
that
score
but
i
rebecca
you
least
of
all
men
rosmer
pointing
out
of
the
window
the
rebecca
oh
john
mrs
helseth
looks
in
in
through
the
door
on
the
left
helseth
miss
west
rebecca
presently
presently
not
now
helseth
just
a
word
miss
rebecca
goes
to
the
door
helseth
tells
her
something
and
they
whisper
together
for
a
moment
then
helseth
nods
and
goes
away
rosmer
uneasily
was
it
anything
for
me
rebecca
no
only
something
about
the
housekeeping
you
ought
to
go
out
into
the
open
air
now
john
dear
you
should
go
for
a
good
long
walk
rosmer
taking
up
his
hat
yes
come
along
we
will
go
together
rebecca
no
dear
i
ca
just
now
you
must
go
by
yourself
but
shake
off
all
these
gloomy
thoughts
promise
me
that
rosmer
i
shall
never
be
able
to
shake
them
quite
off
i
am
afraid
rebecca
oh
but
how
can
you
let
such
groundless
fancies
take
such
a
hold
on
you
rosmer
unfortunately
they
are
not
so
groundless
as
you
think
dear
i
have
lain
thinking
them
over
all
night
perhaps
beata
saw
things
truly
after
all
rebecca
in
what
way
do
you
mean
rosmer
saw
things
truly
when
she
believed
i
loved
you
rebecca
rebecca
truly
in
that
respect
rosmer
laying
his
hat
down
on
the
table
this
is
the
question
i
have
been
wrestling
with
whether
we
two
have
deluded
ourselves
the
whole
time
when
we
have
been
calling
the
tie
between
us
merely
friendship
rebecca
do
you
mean
then
that
the
right
name
for
it
would
have
been
rosmer
love
yes
dear
that
is
what
i
mean
even
while
beata
was
alive
it
was
you
that
i
gave
all
my
thoughts
to
it
was
you
alone
i
yearned
for
it
was
with
you
that
i
experienced
peaceful
joyful
passionless
happiness
when
we
consider
it
rightly
rebecca
our
life
together
began
like
the
sweet
mysterious
love
of
two
children
for
one
another
free
from
desire
or
any
thought
of
anything
more
did
you
not
feel
it
in
that
way
too
tell
me
rebecca
struggling
with
herself
oh
i
do
not
know
what
to
answer
rosmer
and
it
was
this
life
of
intimacy
with
one
another
and
for
one
another
that
we
took
to
be
friendship
no
dear
the
tie
between
us
has
been
a
spiritual
marriage
perhaps
from
the
very
first
day
that
is
why
i
am
guilty
i
had
no
right
to
it
no
right
to
it
for
beata
sake
rebecca
no
right
to
a
happy
life
do
you
believe
that
john
rosmer
she
looked
at
the
relations
between
us
through
the
eyes
of
her
love
judged
them
after
the
nature
of
her
love
and
it
was
only
natural
she
could
not
have
judged
them
otherwise
than
she
did
rebecca
but
how
can
you
so
accuse
yourself
for
beata
delusions
rosmer
it
was
for
love
of
me
in
her
own
way
that
she
threw
herself
into
the
that
fact
is
certain
rebecca
i
can
never
get
beyond
that
rebecca
oh
do
not
think
of
anything
else
but
the
great
splendid
task
that
you
are
going
to
devote
your
life
to
rosmer
shaking
his
head
it
can
never
be
carried
through
not
by
me
not
after
what
i
know
now
rebecca
why
not
by
you
rosmer
because
no
cause
can
ever
triumph
which
has
its
beginnings
in
guilt
rebecca
impetuously
oh
these
are
nothing
but
prejudices
you
have
inherited
these
doubts
these
fears
these
scruples
you
have
a
legend
here
that
your
dead
return
to
haunt
you
in
the
form
of
white
horses
this
seems
to
me
to
be
something
of
that
sort
rosmer
be
that
as
it
may
what
difference
does
it
make
if
i
can
not
shake
it
off
believe
me
rebecca
it
is
as
i
say
any
cause
which
is
to
win
a
lasting
victory
must
be
championed
by
a
man
who
is
joyous
and
innocent
rebecca
but
is
joy
so
absolutely
indispensable
to
you
john
rosmer
joy
yes
indeed
it
is
rebecca
to
you
who
never
laugh
rosmer
yes
in
spite
of
that
believe
me
i
have
a
great
capacity
for
joy
rebecca
now
you
really
must
go
out
dear
for
a
long
walk
a
really
long
one
do
you
hear
there
is
your
hat
and
there
is
your
stick
rosmer
taking
them
from
her
thank
you
and
you
wo
come
too
rebecca
no
no
i
ca
come
now
rosmer
very
well
you
are
none
the
less
always
with
me
now
goes
out
by
the
entrance
hall
after
a
moment
rebecca
peeps
out
from
behind
the
door
which
he
has
left
open
then
she
goes
to
the
door
on
the
right
which
she
opens
rebecca
in
a
whisper
now
helseth
you
can
let
him
come
in
now
crosses
to
the
window
a
moment
later
kroll
comes
in
from
the
right
he
bows
to
her
silently
and
formally
and
keeps
his
hat
in
his
hand
kroll
has
he
gone
then
rebecca
yes
kroll
does
he
generally
stay
out
long
rebecca
yes
but
he
is
in
a
very
uncertain
mood
so
if
you
do
not
want
to
meet
him
kroll
certainly
not
it
is
you
i
wish
to
speak
to
and
quite
alone
rebecca
then
we
had
better
make
the
best
of
our
time
please
sit
down
she
sits
down
in
an
by
the
window
kroll
takes
a
chair
beside
her
kroll
miss
west
you
can
scarcely
have
any
idea
how
deeply
pained
and
unhappy
i
am
over
this
revolution
that
has
taken
place
in
john
ideas
rebecca
we
were
prepared
for
that
being
so
at
first
kroll
only
at
first
rosmer
rosmer
hoped
confidently
that
sooner
or
later
you
would
take
your
place
beside
him
kroll
i
rebecca
you
and
all
his
other
friends
kroll
that
should
convince
you
how
feeble
his
judgment
is
on
any
matter
concerning
his
and
the
affairs
of
real
life
rebecca
in
any
case
now
that
he
feels
the
absolute
necessity
of
cutting
himself
free
on
all
sides
kroll
yes
but
let
me
tell
you
that
is
exactly
what
i
do
not
believe
rebecca
what
do
you
believe
then
kroll
i
believe
it
is
you
that
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
thing
rebecca
your
wife
put
that
into
your
head
kroll
kroll
it
does
not
matter
who
put
it
into
my
head
the
point
is
this
that
i
feel
grave
doubts
exceedingly
grave
doubts
when
i
recall
and
think
over
the
whole
of
your
behaviour
since
you
came
here
rebecca
looking
at
him
i
have
a
notion
that
there
was
a
time
when
you
had
an
exceedingly
strong
belief
in
me
dear
kroll
i
might
almost
say
a
warm
belief
kroll
in
a
subdued
voice
i
believe
you
could
bewitch
any
one
if
you
set
yourself
to
do
it
rebecca
and
you
say
i
set
myself
to
do
it
kroll
yes
you
did
i
am
no
longer
such
a
simpleton
as
to
suppose
that
sentiment
entered
into
your
little
game
at
all
you
simply
wanted
to
secure
yourself
admission
to
rosmersholm
to
establish
yourself
here
that
was
what
i
was
to
help
you
to
i
see
it
now
rebecca
then
you
have
completely
forgotten
that
it
was
beata
that
begged
and
entreated
me
to
come
and
live
here
kroll
yes
because
you
had
bewitched
her
too
are
you
going
to
pretend
that
friendship
is
the
name
for
what
she
came
to
feel
towards
you
it
was
idolatry
adoration
it
degenerated
into
a
what
shall
i
call
it
a
sort
of
desperate
passion
yes
that
is
just
the
word
for
it
rebecca
have
the
goodness
to
remember
the
condition
your
sister
was
in
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
do
not
think
i
can
be
said
to
be
particularly
emotional
in
any
way
kroll
no
you
certainly
are
not
but
that
makes
you
all
the
more
dangerous
to
those
whom
you
wish
to
get
into
your
power
it
comes
easy
to
you
to
act
with
deliberation
and
careful
calculation
just
because
you
have
a
cold
heart
rebecca
cold
are
you
so
sure
of
that
kroll
i
am
certain
of
it
now
otherwise
you
could
not
have
pursued
your
object
here
so
unswervingly
year
after
year
yes
yes
you
have
gained
what
you
wanted
you
have
got
him
and
everything
else
here
into
your
power
but
to
carry
out
your
schemes
you
have
not
scrupled
to
make
him
unhappy
rebecca
that
is
not
true
it
is
not
i
it
is
you
yourself
that
have
made
him
unhappy
kroll
i
rebecca
yes
by
leading
him
to
imagine
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
terrible
end
that
overtook
beata
kroll
did
that
affect
him
so
deeply
then
rebecca
of
course
a
man
of
such
gentle
disposition
as
he
kroll
i
imagined
that
one
of
your
emancipated
men
would
know
how
to
overcome
any
scruples
but
there
it
is
oh
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
turned
out
just
as
i
expected
the
descendant
of
the
men
who
are
looking
at
us
from
these
walls
need
not
think
he
can
break
loose
from
what
has
been
handed
down
as
an
inviolable
inheritance
from
generation
to
generation
rebecca
looking
thoughtfully
in
front
of
her
john
rosmer
nature
is
deeply
rooted
in
his
ancestors
that
is
certainly
very
true
kroll
yes
and
you
ought
to
have
taken
that
into
consideration
if
you
had
had
any
sympathy
for
him
but
i
dare
say
you
were
incapable
of
that
sort
of
consideration
your
is
so
very
from
his
you
see
rebecca
what
do
you
mean
by
my
kroll
i
mean
the
of
origin
of
parentage
miss
west
rebecca
i
see
yes
it
is
quite
true
that
my
origin
is
very
humble
but
nevertheless
kroll
i
am
not
alluding
to
rank
or
position
i
am
thinking
of
the
moral
aspect
of
your
origin
rebecca
of
my
origin
in
what
respect
kroll
in
respect
of
your
birth
generally
rebecca
what
are
you
saying
kroll
i
am
only
saying
it
because
it
explains
the
whole
of
your
conduct
rebecca
i
do
not
understand
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
mean
kroll
i
really
thought
you
did
not
need
telling
otherwise
it
would
seem
a
very
strange
thing
that
you
let
yourself
be
adopted
by
west
rebecca
getting
up
oh
that
is
it
now
i
understand
kroll
and
took
his
name
your
mother
name
was
gamvik
rebecca
crossing
the
room
my
father
name
was
gamvik
kroll
kroll
your
mother
occupation
must
of
course
have
brought
her
continually
into
contact
with
the
district
physician
rebecca
you
are
quite
right
kroll
and
then
he
takes
you
to
live
with
him
immediately
upon
your
mother
death
he
treats
you
harshly
and
yet
you
stay
with
him
you
know
that
he
will
not
leave
you
a
single
penny
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
only
got
a
box
of
books
and
yet
you
endure
living
with
him
put
up
with
his
behaviour
and
nurse
him
to
the
end
rebecca
comes
to
the
table
and
looks
at
him
scornfully
and
my
doing
all
that
makes
it
clear
to
you
that
there
was
something
immoral
something
criminal
about
my
birth
kroll
what
you
did
for
him
i
attributed
to
an
unconscious
filial
instinct
and
as
far
as
the
rest
of
it
goes
i
consider
that
the
whole
of
your
conduct
has
been
the
outcome
of
your
origin
rebecca
hotly
but
there
is
not
a
single
word
of
truth
in
what
you
say
and
i
can
prove
it
west
had
not
come
to
finmark
when
i
was
born
kroll
excuse
me
miss
west
he
went
there
a
year
before
you
were
born
i
have
ascertained
that
rebecca
you
are
mistaken
i
tell
you
you
are
absolutely
mistaken
kroll
you
said
here
the
day
before
yesterday
that
you
were
going
on
for
thirty
rebecca
really
did
i
say
that
kroll
yes
you
did
and
from
that
i
can
calculate
rebecca
stop
that
will
not
help
you
to
calculate
for
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
i
am
a
year
older
than
i
give
myself
out
to
be
kroll
smiling
incredulously
really
that
is
something
new
how
is
that
rebecca
when
i
had
passed
my
birthday
i
thought
i
was
getting
altogether
too
old
for
an
unmarried
girl
so
i
resolved
to
tell
a
lie
and
take
a
year
off
my
age
kroll
you
an
emancipated
woman
cherishing
prejudices
as
to
the
marriageable
age
rebecca
i
know
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
and
ridiculous
too
but
every
one
has
some
prejudice
or
another
that
they
can
not
get
quite
rid
of
we
are
like
that
kroll
maybe
but
my
calculation
may
be
quite
correct
all
the
same
because
west
was
up
in
finmark
for
a
flying
visit
the
year
before
he
was
appointed
rebecca
impetuously
that
is
not
true
kroll
is
it
rebecca
no
my
mother
never
mentioned
it
kroll
did
she
really
rebecca
no
never
nor
west
either
never
a
word
of
it
kroll
might
that
not
be
because
they
both
had
good
reason
to
jump
over
a
year
just
as
you
have
done
yourself
miss
west
perhaps
it
is
a
family
failing
rebecca
walking
about
wringing
her
hands
it
is
impossible
it
is
only
something
you
want
to
make
me
believe
nothing
in
the
world
will
make
me
believe
it
it
can
not
be
true
nothing
in
the
world
kroll
getting
up
but
my
dear
miss
west
why
in
heaven
name
do
you
take
it
in
this
way
you
quite
alarm
me
what
am
i
to
believe
and
think
rebecca
nothing
neither
believe
nor
think
anything
kroll
then
you
really
must
give
me
some
explanation
of
your
taking
this
matter
this
possibility
so
much
to
heart
rebecca
controlling
herself
it
is
quite
obvious
i
should
think
kroll
i
have
no
desire
for
people
here
to
think
me
an
illegitimate
child
kroll
quite
so
well
well
let
us
be
content
with
your
explanation
for
the
present
but
you
see
that
is
another
point
on
which
you
have
cherished
a
certain
prejudice
rebecca
yes
that
is
quite
true
kroll
and
it
seems
to
me
that
very
much
the
same
applies
to
most
of
this
emancipation
of
yours
as
you
call
it
your
reading
has
introduced
you
to
a
of
new
ideas
and
opinions
you
have
made
a
certain
acquaintance
with
researches
that
are
going
on
in
various
directions
researches
that
seem
to
you
to
upset
a
good
many
ideas
that
people
have
hitherto
considered
incontrovertible
and
unassailable
but
all
this
has
never
gone
any
further
than
knowledge
in
your
case
miss
west
a
mere
matter
of
the
intellect
it
has
not
got
into
your
blood
rebecca
thoughtfully
perhaps
you
are
right
kroll
yes
only
test
yourself
and
you
will
see
and
if
it
is
true
in
your
case
it
is
easy
to
recognise
how
true
it
must
be
in
john
rosmer
of
course
it
is
madness
pure
and
simple
he
will
be
running
headlong
to
his
ruin
if
he
persists
in
coming
openly
forward
and
proclaiming
himself
an
apostate
just
think
of
it
he
with
his
shy
disposition
think
of
him
disowned
hounded
out
of
the
circle
to
which
he
has
always
belonged
exposed
to
the
uncompromising
attacks
of
all
the
best
people
in
the
place
nothing
would
ever
make
him
the
man
to
endure
that
rebecca
he
must
endure
it
it
is
too
late
now
for
him
to
draw
back
kroll
not
a
bit
too
late
not
by
any
means
too
late
what
has
happened
can
be
hushed
up
or
at
any
rate
can
be
explained
away
as
a
purely
temporary
though
regrettable
aberration
but
there
is
one
step
that
it
is
absolutely
essential
he
should
take
rebecca
and
that
is
kroll
you
must
get
him
to
legalise
his
position
miss
west
rebecca
the
position
in
which
he
stands
to
me
kroll
yes
you
must
see
that
you
get
him
to
do
that
rebecca
then
you
ca
rid
yourself
of
the
conviction
that
the
relations
between
us
need
legalising
as
you
say
kroll
i
do
not
wish
to
go
any
more
precisely
into
the
question
but
i
certainly
have
observed
that
the
conditions
under
which
it
always
seems
easiest
for
people
to
abandon
all
their
prejudices
are
when
ahem
rebecca
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
relations
between
a
man
and
a
woman
i
suppose
you
mean
kroll
yes
to
speak
candidly
that
is
what
i
mean
rebecca
walks
across
the
room
and
looks
out
of
the
window
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
i
wish
you
had
been
right
kroll
kroll
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
say
it
so
strangely
rebecca
oh
nothing
do
not
let
us
talk
any
more
about
it
ah
there
he
is
kroll
already
i
will
go
then
rebecca
turning
to
him
no
stay
here
and
you
will
hear
something
kroll
not
now
i
do
not
think
i
could
bear
to
see
him
rebecca
i
beg
you
to
stay
please
do
or
you
will
regret
it
later
it
is
the
last
time
i
shall
ever
ask
you
to
do
anything
kroll
looks
at
her
in
surprise
and
lays
his
hat
down
very
well
miss
west
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
a
short
pause
then
rosmer
comes
in
from
the
hall
rosmer
stops
at
the
door
as
he
sees
kroll
what
you
here
rebecca
he
wanted
to
avoid
meeting
you
john
kroll
involuntarily
john
rebecca
yes
kroll
john
and
i
call
each
other
by
our
christian
names
that
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
relations
between
us
kroll
was
that
what
i
was
to
hear
if
i
stayed
rebecca
yes
that
and
something
else
rosmer
coming
into
the
room
what
is
the
object
of
your
visit
here
kroll
i
wanted
to
make
one
more
effort
to
stop
you
and
win
you
back
rosmer
pointing
to
the
newspaper
after
that
kroll
i
did
not
write
it
rosmer
did
you
take
any
steps
to
prevent
its
appearing
kroll
that
would
have
been
acting
unjustifiably
towards
the
cause
i
serve
and
besides
that
i
had
no
power
to
prevent
it
rebecca
tears
the
newspaper
into
pieces
which
she
crumples
up
and
throws
into
the
back
of
the
stove
there
now
it
is
out
of
sight
let
it
be
out
of
mind
too
because
there
will
be
no
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
john
kroll
indeed
i
wish
you
could
ensure
that
rebecca
come
and
let
us
sit
down
dear
all
three
of
us
then
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
rosmer
sitting
down
involuntarily
what
has
come
over
you
rebecca
you
are
so
unnaturally
calm
what
is
it
rebecca
the
calmness
of
determination
sits
down
please
sit
down
too
kroll
he
takes
a
seat
on
the
couch
rosmer
determination
you
say
determination
to
do
what
rebecca
i
want
to
give
you
back
what
you
need
in
order
to
live
your
life
you
shall
have
your
happy
innocence
back
dear
friend
rosmer
but
what
do
you
mean
rebecca
i
will
just
tell
you
what
happened
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
rosmer
well
rebecca
when
i
came
down
here
from
finmark
with
west
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
new
great
wide
world
was
opened
to
me
west
had
given
me
an
erratic
sort
of
education
had
taught
me
all
the
odds
and
ends
that
i
knew
about
life
then
has
an
evident
struggle
with
herself
and
speaks
in
barely
audible
tones
and
then
kroll
and
then
rosmer
but
rebecca
i
know
all
this
rebecca
collecting
herself
yes
that
is
true
enough
you
know
it
only
too
well
kroll
looking
fixedly
at
her
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
left
you
rebecca
no
stay
where
you
are
dear
kroll
to
rosmer
well
this
was
how
it
was
i
wanted
to
play
my
part
in
the
new
day
that
was
dawning
to
have
a
share
in
all
the
new
ideas
kroll
told
me
one
day
that
ulrik
brendel
had
had
a
great
influence
over
you
once
when
you
were
a
boy
i
thought
it
might
be
possible
for
me
to
resume
that
influence
here
rosmer
did
you
come
here
with
a
covert
design
rebecca
what
i
wanted
was
that
we
two
should
go
forward
together
on
the
road
towards
freedom
always
forward
and
further
forward
but
there
was
that
gloomy
insurmountable
barrier
between
you
and
a
full
complete
emancipation
rosmer
what
barrier
do
you
mean
rebecca
i
mean
john
that
you
could
never
have
attained
freedom
except
in
the
full
glory
of
the
sunshine
and
instead
of
that
here
you
were
ailing
and
languishing
in
the
gloom
of
such
a
marriage
as
yours
rosmer
you
have
never
spoken
to
me
of
my
marriage
in
that
way
before
rebecca
no
i
did
not
dare
for
fear
of
frightening
you
kroll
nodding
to
rosmer
you
hear
that
rebecca
resuming
but
i
saw
quite
well
where
your
salvation
lay
your
only
salvation
and
so
i
acted
rosmer
how
do
you
mean
you
acted
kroll
do
you
mean
that
rebecca
yes
john
gets
up
no
do
not
get
up
nor
you
either
kroll
but
we
must
let
in
the
daylight
now
it
was
not
you
john
you
are
innocent
it
was
i
that
lured
that
ended
by
luring
beata
into
the
tortuous
path
rosmer
springing
up
rebecca
kroll
getting
up
into
the
tortuous
path
rebecca
into
the
path
that
led
to
the
now
you
know
it
both
of
you
rosmer
as
if
stunned
but
i
do
not
understand
what
is
she
standing
there
saying
i
do
not
understand
a
word
kroll
yes
yes
i
begin
to
understand
rosmer
but
what
did
you
do
what
did
you
find
to
tell
her
because
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
rebecca
she
got
to
know
that
you
were
determined
to
emancipate
yourself
from
all
your
old
prejudices
rosmer
yes
but
at
that
time
i
had
come
to
no
decision
rebecca
i
knew
that
you
soon
would
come
to
one
kroll
nodding
to
rosmer
aha
rosmer
well
and
what
more
i
want
to
know
everything
now
rebecca
some
time
afterwards
i
begged
and
implored
her
to
let
me
leave
rosmersholm
rosmer
why
did
you
want
to
leave
here
then
rebecca
i
did
not
want
to
i
wanted
to
remain
where
i
was
but
i
told
her
that
it
would
be
best
for
us
all
if
i
went
away
in
time
i
let
her
infer
that
if
i
remained
here
any
longer
i
could
not
tell
happen
rosmer
that
is
what
you
said
and
did
then
rebecca
yes
john
rosmer
that
is
what
you
referred
to
when
you
said
that
you
acted
rebecca
in
a
broken
voice
yes
that
was
it
rosmer
after
a
pause
have
you
confessed
everything
now
rebecca
rebecca
yes
kroll
not
everything
rebecca
looking
at
him
in
terror
what
else
can
there
be
kroll
did
you
not
eventually
lead
beata
to
believe
that
it
was
necessary
not
merely
that
it
should
be
best
but
that
it
was
necessary
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
john
that
you
should
go
away
somewhere
else
as
soon
as
possible
well
rebecca
speaking
low
and
indistinctly
perhaps
i
did
say
something
of
the
sort
rosmer
sinking
into
a
chair
by
the
window
and
she
poor
sick
creature
believed
in
this
tissue
of
lies
and
deceit
believed
in
it
so
completely
so
absolutely
looks
up
at
rebecca
and
she
never
came
to
me
about
it
never
said
a
word
ah
rebecca
i
see
it
in
your
face
you
dissuaded
her
from
doing
so
rebecca
you
know
she
had
taken
it
into
her
head
that
she
a
childless
wife
had
no
right
to
be
here
and
so
she
persuaded
herself
that
her
duty
to
you
was
to
give
place
to
another
rosmer
and
you
you
did
nothing
to
rid
her
mind
of
such
an
idea
rebecca
no
kroll
perhaps
you
encouraged
her
in
the
idea
answer
did
you
not
do
so
rebecca
that
was
how
she
understood
me
i
believe
rosmer
yes
yes
and
she
bowed
to
your
will
in
everything
and
so
she
gave
place
springs
up
how
could
you
how
could
you
go
on
with
this
terrible
tragedy
rebecca
i
thought
there
were
two
lives
here
to
choose
between
john
kroll
severely
and
with
authority
you
had
no
right
to
make
any
such
choice
rebecca
impetuously
surely
you
do
not
think
i
acted
with
cold
and
calculating
composure
i
am
a
different
woman
now
when
i
am
telling
you
this
from
what
i
was
then
and
i
believe
two
different
kinds
of
will
can
exist
at
the
same
time
in
one
person
i
wanted
beata
away
in
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
never
thought
it
would
happen
all
the
same
at
every
step
i
ventured
and
risked
i
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
in
me
crying
no
further
not
a
step
further
and
yet
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
stop
i
had
to
venture
a
little
bit
further
just
one
step
and
then
another
and
always
another
and
at
last
it
happened
that
is
how
such
things
go
of
themselves
a
short
silence
rosmer
to
rebecca
and
how
do
you
think
it
will
go
with
you
in
the
future
after
this
rebecca
things
must
go
with
me
as
they
can
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
kroll
not
a
word
suggestive
of
remorse
perhaps
you
feel
none
rebecca
dismissing
his
remark
coldly
excuse
me
kroll
that
is
a
matter
that
is
no
concern
of
any
one
else
that
is
an
account
i
must
settle
with
myself
kroll
to
rosmer
and
this
is
the
woman
you
have
been
living
under
the
same
roof
with
in
relations
of
the
completest
confidence
looks
up
at
the
portraits
on
the
walls
if
only
those
that
are
gone
could
look
down
now
rosmer
are
you
going
into
the
town
kroll
taking
up
his
hat
yes
the
sooner
the
better
rosmer
taking
his
hat
also
then
i
will
go
with
you
kroll
you
will
ah
i
thought
we
had
not
quite
lost
you
rosmer
come
then
kroll
come
they
both
go
out
into
the
hall
without
looking
at
rebecca
after
a
minute
rebecca
goes
cautiously
to
the
window
and
peeps
out
between
the
flowers
rebecca
speaking
to
herself
half
aloud
not
over
the
bridge
either
he
is
going
round
never
over
the
millrace
never
comes
away
from
the
window
as
i
thought
she
goes
over
to
the
bell
and
rings
it
soon
afterwards
helseth
comes
in
from
the
right
helseth
what
is
it
miss
rebecca
helseth
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
fetch
my
travelling
trunk
down
from
the
loft
helseth
your
trunk
rebecca
yes
the
brown
you
know
helseth
certainly
miss
but
bless
my
soul
are
you
going
away
on
a
journey
miss
rebecca
yes
i
am
going
away
on
a
journey
helseth
helseth
and
immediately
rebecca
as
soon
as
i
have
packed
helseth
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
but
you
are
coming
back
again
soon
i
suppose
miss
rebecca
i
am
never
coming
back
again
helseth
never
but
my
goodness
what
is
to
become
of
us
at
rosmersholm
if
miss
west
is
not
here
any
longer
just
as
everything
was
making
poor
rosmer
so
happy
and
comfortable
rebecca
yes
but
i
have
had
a
fright
helseth
helseth
a
fright
good
rebecca
i
fancy
i
have
had
a
glimpse
of
the
white
horse
helseth
of
the
white
horse
in
broad
daylight
rebecca
ah
they
are
out
both
early
and
late
the
white
horses
of
rosmersholm
crosses
the
room
well
we
were
speaking
of
my
trunk
helseth
helseth
yes
miss
your
trunk
they
both
go
out
to
the
right
act
iv
the
same
room
in
the
late
evening
the
lamp
with
a
shade
on
it
is
burning
on
the
table
rebecca
is
standing
by
the
table
packing
some
small
articles
in
a
her
cloak
hat
and
the
white
crochetted
shawl
are
hanging
on
the
back
of
the
couch
helseth
comes
in
from
the
right
helseth
speaking
in
low
tones
and
with
a
reserved
manner
yes
all
your
things
have
been
taken
down
miss
they
are
in
the
kitchen
passage
rebecca
thank
you
you
have
ordered
the
carriage
helseth
yes
miss
the
coachman
wants
to
know
what
time
he
shall
bring
it
round
rebecca
i
think
at
about
eleven
the
boat
goes
at
midnight
helseth
with
a
little
hesitation
but
what
about
rosmer
suppose
he
is
not
back
by
that
time
rebecca
i
shall
start
all
the
same
if
i
should
not
see
him
you
can
tell
him
i
will
write
to
him
a
long
letter
say
that
helseth
yes
i
dare
say
it
will
be
all
right
to
write
but
poor
dear
i
really
think
that
you
ought
to
try
and
have
a
talk
with
him
once
more
rebecca
perhaps
i
ought
or
perhaps
not
after
all
helseth
dear
dear
i
never
thought
i
should
live
to
see
such
a
thing
as
this
rebecca
what
did
you
think
then
helseth
helseth
to
tell
the
truth
miss
i
thought
rosmer
was
an
honester
man
than
that
rebecca
honester
helseth
yes
miss
that
is
the
truth
rebecca
but
my
dear
helseth
what
do
you
mean
by
that
helseth
i
mean
what
is
true
and
right
miss
he
should
not
get
out
of
it
in
this
way
that
he
should
rebecca
looking
at
her
now
look
here
helseth
tell
me
honestly
and
frankly
why
you
think
i
am
going
away
helseth
good
lord
miss
because
it
is
necessary
i
suppose
well
well
still
i
certainly
do
not
think
rosmer
has
behaved
well
there
was
some
excuse
in
mortensgaard
case
because
the
husband
was
still
alive
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
marry
however
much
they
wished
it
but
rosmer
he
could
ahem
rebecca
with
a
faint
smile
is
it
possible
that
you
could
think
such
things
about
me
and
rosmer
helseth
not
for
a
moment
until
i
mean
rebecca
but
why
helseth
well
after
all
the
horrible
things
they
tell
me
one
may
see
in
the
papers
about
rosmer
rebecca
ah
helseth
what
i
mean
is
this
if
a
man
can
go
over
to
mortensgaard
religion
you
may
believe
him
capable
of
anything
and
that
the
truth
rebecca
yes
very
likely
but
about
me
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
me
helseth
well
i
am
sure
miss
i
do
not
think
you
are
so
greatly
to
be
blamed
it
is
not
always
so
easy
for
a
lone
woman
to
resist
i
dare
say
we
are
all
human
after
all
miss
west
rebecca
that
is
very
true
helseth
we
are
all
human
after
what
are
you
listening
to
helseth
in
a
low
voice
good
lord
i
believe
that
is
him
coming
now
rebecca
with
a
start
in
spite
of
everything
then
speaks
with
determination
very
well
so
be
it
rosmer
comes
in
from
the
hall
he
sees
the
luggage
and
turns
to
rebecca
rosmer
what
does
this
mean
rebecca
i
am
going
away
rosmer
at
once
rebecca
yes
to
mrs
helseth
eleven
then
helseth
very
well
miss
goes
out
to
the
right
rosmer
after
a
short
pause
where
are
you
going
rebecca
rebecca
i
am
taking
the
boat
for
the
north
rosmer
north
what
are
you
going
there
for
rebecca
it
is
where
i
came
from
rosmer
but
you
have
no
more
ties
there
now
rebecca
i
have
none
here
either
rosmer
what
do
you
propose
to
do
rebecca
i
do
not
know
i
only
want
to
make
an
end
of
it
rosmer
make
an
end
of
what
rebecca
rosmersholm
has
broken
me
rosmer
more
attentively
what
is
that
rebecca
broken
me
utterly
i
had
a
will
of
my
own
and
some
courage
when
i
came
here
now
i
am
crushed
under
the
law
of
strangers
i
do
not
think
i
shall
have
the
courage
to
begin
anything
else
in
the
world
after
this
rosmer
why
not
what
do
you
mean
by
being
crushed
under
a
law
rebecca
dear
friend
do
not
let
us
talk
about
that
now
tell
me
what
passed
between
you
and
kroll
rosmer
we
have
made
our
peace
rebecca
quite
so
so
it
came
to
that
rosmer
he
got
together
all
our
old
circle
of
friends
at
his
house
they
convinced
me
that
the
work
of
ennobling
men
souls
was
not
in
my
line
at
all
besides
it
is
such
a
hopeless
task
any
way
i
shall
let
it
alone
rebecca
well
perhaps
it
is
better
so
rosmer
do
you
say
that
now
is
that
what
your
opinion
is
now
rebecca
i
have
come
to
that
opinion
in
the
last
day
or
two
rosmer
you
are
lying
rebecca
rebecca
lying
rosmer
yes
lying
you
have
never
believed
in
me
you
have
never
believed
me
to
be
the
man
to
lead
the
cause
to
victory
rebecca
i
have
believed
that
we
two
together
would
be
equal
to
it
rosmer
that
is
not
true
you
have
believed
that
you
could
accomplish
something
big
in
life
yourself
that
you
could
use
me
to
further
your
plans
that
i
might
be
useful
to
you
in
the
pursuit
of
your
object
that
is
what
you
have
believed
rebecca
listen
to
me
john
rosmer
sitting
down
wearily
on
the
couch
oh
let
me
be
i
see
the
whole
thing
clearly
now
i
have
been
like
a
glove
in
your
hands
rebecca
listen
to
me
john
let
us
talk
this
thing
over
it
will
be
for
the
last
time
sits
down
in
a
chair
by
the
couch
i
had
intended
to
write
to
you
about
it
all
when
i
had
gone
back
north
but
it
is
much
better
that
you
should
hear
it
at
once
rosmer
have
you
something
more
to
tell
then
rebecca
the
most
important
part
of
it
all
rosmer
what
do
you
mean
rebecca
something
that
you
have
never
suspected
something
that
puts
all
the
rest
in
its
true
light
rosmer
shaking
his
head
i
do
not
understand
at
all
rebecca
it
is
quite
true
that
at
one
time
i
did
play
my
cards
so
as
to
secure
admission
to
rosmersholm
my
idea
was
that
i
should
succeed
in
doing
well
for
myself
here
either
in
one
way
or
in
another
you
understand
rosmer
well
you
succeeded
in
carrying
your
scheme
through
too
rebecca
i
believe
i
could
have
carried
anything
through
at
that
time
for
then
i
still
had
the
courage
of
a
free
will
i
had
no
one
else
to
consider
nothing
to
turn
me
from
my
path
but
then
began
what
has
broken
down
my
will
and
filled
the
whole
of
my
life
with
dread
and
wretchedness
rosmer
what
began
speak
so
that
i
can
understand
you
rebecca
there
came
over
me
a
wild
uncontrollable
passion
oh
john
rosmer
passion
you
for
what
rebecca
for
you
rosmer
getting
up
what
does
this
mean
rebecca
preventing
him
sit
still
dear
i
will
tell
you
more
about
it
rosmer
and
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
loved
me
in
that
way
rebecca
i
thought
i
might
call
it
loving
you
then
i
thought
it
was
love
but
it
was
not
it
was
what
i
have
said
a
wild
uncontrollable
passion
rosmer
speaking
with
difficulty
rebecca
is
it
really
you
you
who
are
sitting
here
telling
me
this
rebecca
yes
indeed
it
is
john
rosmer
then
it
was
as
the
outcome
of
this
and
under
the
influence
of
this
that
you
acted
as
you
called
it
rebecca
it
swept
over
me
like
a
storm
over
the
sea
like
one
of
the
storms
we
have
in
winter
in
the
north
they
catch
you
up
and
rush
you
along
with
them
you
know
until
their
fury
is
expended
there
is
no
withstanding
them
rosmer
so
it
swept
poor
unhappy
beata
into
the
rebecca
yes
it
was
like
a
fight
for
life
between
beata
and
me
at
that
time
rosmer
you
proved
the
strongest
of
us
all
at
rosmersholm
stronger
than
both
beata
and
me
put
together
rebecca
i
knew
you
well
enough
to
know
that
i
could
not
get
at
you
in
any
way
until
you
were
set
free
both
in
actual
circumstances
and
in
your
soul
rosmer
but
i
do
not
understand
you
rebecca
you
you
yourself
and
your
whole
conduct
are
an
insoluble
riddle
to
me
i
am
free
now
both
in
my
soul
and
my
circumstances
you
are
absolutely
in
touch
with
the
goal
you
set
before
yourself
from
the
beginning
and
nevertheless
rebecca
i
have
never
stood
farther
from
my
goal
than
i
do
now
rosmer
and
nevertheless
i
say
when
yesterday
i
asked
you
urged
you
to
become
my
wife
you
cried
out
that
it
never
could
be
rebecca
i
cried
out
in
despair
john
rosmer
why
rebecca
because
rosmersholm
has
unnerved
me
all
the
courage
has
been
sapped
out
of
my
will
here
crushed
out
the
time
has
gone
for
me
to
dare
risk
anything
whatever
i
have
lost
all
power
of
action
john
rosmer
tell
me
how
that
has
come
about
rebecca
it
has
come
about
through
my
living
with
you
rosmer
but
how
how
rebecca
when
i
was
alone
with
you
here
and
you
had
really
found
yourself
rosmer
yes
yes
rebecca
for
you
never
really
found
yourself
as
long
as
beata
was
alive
rosmer
alas
you
are
right
in
that
rebecca
when
it
came
about
that
i
was
living
together
with
you
here
in
peace
and
solitude
when
you
exchanged
all
your
thoughts
with
me
unreservedly
your
every
mood
however
tender
or
intimate
then
the
great
change
happened
in
me
little
by
little
you
understand
almost
imperceptibly
but
overwhelmingly
in
the
end
till
it
reached
the
uttermost
depths
of
my
soul
rosmer
what
does
this
mean
rebecca
rebecca
all
the
other
feeling
all
that
horrible
passion
that
had
drowned
my
better
self
left
me
entirely
all
the
violent
emotions
that
had
been
roused
in
me
were
quelled
and
silenced
a
peace
stole
over
my
soul
a
quiet
like
that
of
one
of
our
mountain
peaks
up
under
the
midnight
sun
rosmer
tell
me
more
of
it
all
that
you
can
rebecca
there
is
not
much
more
to
tell
only
that
this
was
how
love
grew
up
in
my
heart
a
great
love
content
with
such
a
union
of
hearts
as
there
has
been
between
us
two
rosmer
oh
if
only
i
had
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
all
this
rebecca
it
is
best
as
it
is
yesterday
when
you
asked
me
if
i
would
be
your
wife
i
gave
a
cry
of
joy
rosmer
yes
it
was
that
rebecca
was
it
not
i
thought
that
was
what
it
meant
rebecca
for
a
moment
forgot
myself
for
a
moment
it
was
my
dauntless
will
of
the
old
days
that
was
struggling
to
be
free
again
but
now
it
has
no
more
strength
it
has
lost
it
for
ever
rosmer
how
do
you
explain
what
has
taken
place
in
you
rebecca
it
is
the
rosmer
attitude
towards
your
attitude
towards
life
at
any
rate
that
has
infected
my
will
rosmer
infected
rebecca
yes
and
made
it
sickly
bound
it
captive
under
laws
that
formerly
had
no
meaning
for
me
you
my
life
together
with
you
have
ennobled
my
soul
rosmer
ah
if
i
dared
believe
that
to
be
true
rebecca
you
may
believe
it
confidently
the
rosmer
attitude
towards
life
ennobles
shakes
her
head
rosmer
but
well
rebecca
but
it
kills
joy
you
know
rosmer
do
you
say
that
rebecca
rebecca
for
me
at
all
events
rosmer
yes
but
are
you
so
sure
of
that
if
i
asked
you
again
now
implored
you
rebecca
oh
my
dear
never
go
back
to
that
again
it
is
impossible
yes
impossible
because
i
must
tell
you
this
john
i
have
a
past
behind
me
rosmer
something
more
than
you
have
told
me
rebecca
yes
something
more
and
something
different
rosmer
with
a
faint
smile
it
is
very
strange
rebecca
but
do
you
know
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
has
occurred
to
me
more
than
once
rebecca
it
has
and
yet
notwithstanding
that
you
rosmer
i
never
believed
in
it
i
only
played
with
the
more
rebecca
if
you
wish
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
at
once
rosmer
stopping
her
no
no
i
do
not
want
to
hear
a
word
about
it
whatever
it
is
it
shall
be
forgotten
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
rebecca
but
i
can
not
forget
it
rosmer
oh
rebecca
rebecca
yes
dear
that
is
just
the
dreadful
part
of
now
when
all
the
happiness
of
life
is
freely
and
fully
offered
to
me
all
i
can
feel
is
that
i
am
barred
out
from
it
by
my
past
rosmer
your
past
is
dead
rebecca
it
has
no
longer
any
hold
on
you
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
as
you
are
now
rebecca
ah
my
dear
those
are
mere
words
you
know
what
about
innocence
then
where
am
i
to
get
that
from
rosmer
gloomily
ah
yes
innocence
rebecca
yes
innocence
which
is
at
the
root
of
all
joy
and
happiness
that
was
the
teaching
you
know
that
you
wanted
to
see
realised
by
all
the
men
you
were
going
to
raise
up
to
nobility
and
happiness
rosmer
ah
do
not
remind
me
of
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
dream
rebecca
a
rash
suggestion
that
i
have
no
longer
any
faith
in
human
nature
can
not
be
ennobled
by
outside
influences
believe
me
rebecca
gently
not
by
a
tranquil
love
do
you
think
rosmer
thoughtfully
yes
that
would
be
a
splendid
thing
almost
the
most
glorious
thing
in
life
i
think
if
it
were
so
moves
restlessly
but
how
am
i
ever
to
clear
up
the
question
how
am
i
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
rebecca
do
you
not
believe
in
me
john
rosmer
ah
rebecca
how
can
i
believe
you
entirely
you
whose
life
here
has
been
nothing
but
continual
concealment
and
secrecy
and
now
you
have
this
new
tale
to
tell
if
it
is
cloaking
some
design
of
yours
tell
me
so
openly
perhaps
there
is
something
or
other
that
you
hope
to
gain
by
that
means
i
will
gladly
do
anything
that
i
can
for
you
rebecca
wringing
her
hands
oh
this
killing
doubt
john
john
rosmer
yes
i
know
dear
it
is
horrible
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
shall
never
be
able
to
free
myself
from
it
never
be
able
to
feel
certain
that
your
love
for
me
is
genuine
and
pure
rebecca
but
is
there
nothing
in
your
own
heart
that
bears
witness
to
the
transformation
that
has
taken
place
in
me
and
taken
place
through
your
influence
and
yours
alone
rosmer
ah
my
dear
i
do
not
believe
any
longer
in
my
power
to
transform
people
i
have
no
belief
in
myself
left
at
all
i
do
not
believe
either
in
myself
or
in
you
rebecca
looking
darkly
at
him
how
are
you
going
to
live
out
your
life
then
rosmer
that
is
just
what
i
do
not
know
and
can
not
imagine
i
do
not
believe
i
can
live
it
out
and
moreover
i
do
not
know
anything
in
the
world
that
would
be
worth
living
for
rebecca
life
carries
a
perpetual
rebirth
with
it
let
us
hold
fast
to
it
dear
we
shall
be
finished
with
it
quite
soon
enough
rosmer
getting
up
restlessly
then
give
me
my
faith
back
again
my
faith
in
you
rebecca
my
faith
in
your
love
give
me
a
proof
of
it
i
must
have
some
proof
rebecca
proof
how
can
i
give
you
a
proof
rosmer
you
must
crosses
the
room
i
can
not
bear
this
desolate
horrible
loneliness
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
hall
door
rebecca
getting
up
from
her
chair
did
you
hear
that
the
door
opens
and
ulrik
brendel
comes
in
except
that
he
wears
a
white
shirt
a
black
coat
and
a
good
pair
of
high
boots
he
is
dressed
as
in
the
first
act
he
looks
troubled
rosmer
ah
it
is
you
brendel
brendel
john
my
boy
i
have
come
to
say
to
you
rosmer
where
are
you
going
so
late
as
this
brendel
downhill
rosmer
how
brendel
i
am
on
my
way
home
my
beloved
pupil
i
am
homesick
for
the
great
nothingness
rosmer
something
has
happened
to
you
brendel
what
is
it
brendel
ah
you
notice
the
transformation
then
well
it
is
evident
enough
the
last
time
i
entered
your
doors
i
stood
before
you
a
man
of
substance
slapping
a
pocket
rosmer
really
i
do
quite
understand
brendel
and
now
as
you
see
me
i
am
a
deposed
monarch
standing
over
the
ashes
of
my
palace
rosmer
if
there
is
any
way
i
can
help
you
brendel
you
have
preserved
your
childlike
heart
john
can
you
let
me
have
a
loan
rosmer
yes
most
willingly
brendel
can
you
spare
me
an
ideal
or
two
rosmer
what
do
you
say
brendel
one
or
two
ideals
you
will
be
doing
a
good
deed
i
am
cleaned
out
my
dear
boy
absolutely
and
entirely
rebecca
did
you
not
succeed
in
giving
your
lecture
brendel
no
fair
lady
what
do
you
think
just
as
i
was
standing
ready
to
pour
out
the
contents
of
my
horn
in
plenty
i
made
the
painful
discovery
that
i
was
bankrupt
rebecca
but
what
of
all
your
unwritten
works
then
brendel
for
five
and
twenty
years
i
have
been
like
a
miser
sitting
on
his
locked
and
then
when
i
opened
it
to
take
out
my
treasure
there
was
nothing
there
the
mills
of
time
had
ground
it
into
dust
there
was
not
a
blessed
thing
left
of
the
whole
lot
rosmer
but
are
you
certain
of
that
brendel
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
my
dear
boy
the
president
has
convinced
me
of
that
rosmer
the
president
brendel
oh
well
his
excellency
then
ganz
nach
belieben
rosmer
but
whom
do
you
mean
brendel
peter
mortensgaard
of
course
rosmer
what
brendel
mysteriously
hush
hush
hush
peter
mortensgaard
is
lord
and
chieftain
of
the
future
i
have
never
stood
in
a
more
august
presence
peter
mortensgaard
has
the
power
of
omnipotence
in
him
he
can
do
whatever
he
wants
rosmer
oh
come
do
you
believe
that
brendel
it
is
true
my
boy
because
peter
mortensgaard
never
wants
to
do
more
than
he
can
peter
mortensgaard
is
capable
of
living
his
life
without
ideals
and
that
believe
me
is
precisely
the
great
secret
of
success
in
life
it
sums
up
all
the
wisdom
of
the
world
basta
rosmer
in
a
low
voice
now
i
see
that
you
are
going
away
from
here
poorer
than
you
came
brendel
bien
then
take
an
example
from
your
old
tutor
erase
from
your
mind
everything
that
he
imprinted
there
do
not
build
your
castle
upon
the
shifting
sand
and
look
well
ahead
and
be
sure
of
your
ground
before
you
build
upon
the
charming
creature
who
is
sweetening
your
life
here
rebecca
do
you
mean
me
brendel
yes
most
attractive
mermaid
rebecca
why
am
i
not
fit
to
build
upon
brendel
taking
a
step
nearer
to
her
i
understood
that
my
former
pupil
had
a
cause
which
it
was
his
life
work
to
lead
to
victory
rebecca
and
if
he
has
brendel
he
is
certain
of
victory
but
be
it
distinctly
understood
on
one
unalterable
condition
rebecca
what
is
that
brendel
taking
her
gently
by
the
wrist
that
the
woman
who
loves
him
shall
gladly
go
out
into
the
kitchen
and
chop
off
her
dainty
pink
and
white
little
finger
here
just
at
the
middle
joint
furthermore
that
the
aforesaid
loving
woman
shall
also
gladly
clip
off
her
incomparably
moulded
left
ear
lets
her
go
and
turns
to
rosmer
john
the
victorious
rosmer
must
you
go
now
in
this
dark
night
brendel
the
dark
night
is
best
peace
be
with
you
he
goes
out
silence
in
the
room
for
a
short
time
rebecca
breathing
heavily
how
close
and
sultry
it
is
in
here
goes
to
the
window
opens
it
and
stands
by
it
rosmer
sitting
down
on
a
chair
by
the
stove
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
after
all
rebecca
i
can
see
that
you
must
go
away
rebecca
yes
i
do
not
see
that
i
have
any
choice
rosmer
let
us
make
use
of
our
last
hour
together
come
over
here
and
sit
beside
me
rebecca
goes
and
sits
down
on
the
couch
what
do
you
want
john
rosmer
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
need
have
no
anxiety
about
your
future
rebecca
with
a
smile
hm
my
future
rosmer
i
have
foreseen
all
contingencies
long
ago
whatever
may
happen
you
are
provided
for
rebecca
have
you
even
done
that
for
me
dear
rosmer
you
might
have
known
that
i
should
rebecca
it
is
many
a
long
day
since
i
thought
about
anything
of
the
kind
rosmer
yes
of
course
naturally
you
thought
things
could
never
be
otherwise
between
us
than
as
they
were
rebecca
yes
that
was
what
i
thought
rosmer
so
did
i
but
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
me
now
rebecca
oh
john
you
will
live
longer
than
i
shall
rosmer
i
can
dispose
of
my
miserable
existence
as
i
please
you
know
rebecca
what
do
you
mean
you
surely
are
never
thinking
of
rosmer
do
you
think
it
would
be
so
surprising
after
the
pitiful
lamentable
defeat
i
have
suffered
i
who
was
to
have
made
it
my
work
to
lead
my
cause
to
victory
and
here
i
am
a
deserter
before
the
fight
has
even
really
begun
rebecca
take
up
the
fight
again
john
only
try
and
you
will
see
that
you
will
conquer
you
will
ennoble
hundreds
thousands
of
souls
only
try
rosmer
i
rebecca
who
no
longer
believe
even
in
my
having
a
mission
in
life
rebecca
but
your
mission
has
stood
the
test
you
have
at
all
events
ennobled
one
of
your
for
the
rest
of
her
life
i
mean
myself
rosmer
yes
if
i
dared
believe
you
about
that
rebecca
wringing
her
hands
but
john
do
you
know
of
nothing
nothing
that
would
make
you
believe
that
rosmer
starts
as
if
with
fear
do
venture
on
that
subject
no
further
rebecca
not
a
single
word
more
rebecca
indeed
that
is
just
the
subject
we
must
venture
upon
do
you
know
of
anything
that
would
stifle
your
doubts
for
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
world
rosmer
it
is
best
for
you
not
to
know
best
for
us
both
rebecca
no
no
no
i
have
no
patience
with
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
know
of
anything
that
would
acquit
me
in
your
eyes
i
claim
it
as
my
right
that
you
should
name
it
rosmer
as
if
impelled
against
his
will
well
let
us
see
you
say
that
you
have
great
love
in
your
heart
that
your
soul
has
been
ennobled
through
me
is
that
so
have
you
counted
the
cost
shall
we
try
and
balance
our
accounts
tell
me
rebecca
i
am
quite
ready
rosmer
then
when
shall
it
be
rebecca
whenever
you
like
the
sooner
the
better
rosmer
then
let
me
see
rebecca
whether
you
for
my
very
night
breaks
off
oh
no
no
rebecca
yes
john
yes
yes
say
it
and
you
shall
see
rosmer
have
you
the
courage
are
you
willing
gladly
as
ulrik
brendel
said
for
my
sake
gladly
to
go
the
same
way
that
beata
went
rebecca
gets
up
slowly
from
the
couch
and
says
almost
inaudibly
john
rosmer
yes
dear
that
is
the
question
i
shall
never
be
able
to
rid
my
thoughts
of
when
you
have
gone
away
every
hour
of
the
day
i
shall
come
back
to
it
ah
i
seem
to
see
you
bodily
before
me
standing
out
on
the
out
in
the
middle
now
you
lean
out
over
the
railing
you
grow
dizzy
as
you
feel
drawn
down
towards
the
no
you
recoil
you
dare
not
do
what
she
dared
rebecca
but
if
i
had
the
courage
and
willingly
and
gladly
what
then
rosmer
then
i
would
believe
in
you
then
i
should
get
back
my
faith
in
my
mission
in
life
my
faith
in
my
power
to
ennoble
my
fellow
men
my
faith
in
mankind
power
to
be
ennobled
rebecca
takes
up
her
shawl
slowly
throws
it
over
her
head
and
says
controlling
herself
you
shall
have
your
faith
back
rosmer
have
you
the
courage
and
the
strength
of
will
for
that
rebecca
rebecca
of
that
you
must
judge
in
the
morning
or
later
when
they
take
up
my
body
rosmer
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
there
is
a
horrible
temptation
in
this
rebecca
because
i
should
not
like
to
be
left
lying
there
any
longer
than
need
be
you
must
take
care
that
they
find
me
rosmer
springing
up
but
all
this
is
madness
you
know
go
away
or
stay
i
will
believe
you
on
your
bare
word
this
time
too
rebecca
those
are
mere
words
john
no
more
cowardice
or
evasion
how
can
you
believe
me
on
my
bare
word
after
today
rosmer
but
i
do
not
want
to
see
your
defeat
rebecca
rebecca
there
will
be
no
defeat
rosmer
there
will
you
will
never
have
the
heart
to
go
beata
way
rebecca
do
you
believe
that
rosmer
never
you
are
not
like
beata
you
are
not
under
the
influence
of
a
distorted
view
of
life
rebecca
but
i
am
under
the
influence
of
the
rosmersholm
view
of
life
now
whatever
my
offences
are
it
is
right
that
i
should
expiate
them
rosmer
looking
at
her
fixedly
have
you
come
to
that
decision
rebecca
yes
rosmer
very
well
then
i
too
am
under
the
influence
of
our
unfettered
view
of
life
rebecca
there
is
no
one
that
can
judge
us
and
therefore
we
must
be
our
own
judges
rebecca
misunderstanding
his
meaning
that
too
that
too
my
leaving
you
will
save
the
best
that
is
in
you
rosmer
ah
there
is
nothing
left
to
save
in
me
rebecca
there
is
but
i
after
this
i
should
only
be
like
some
hanging
on
to
the
barque
you
are
striving
to
sail
forward
in
and
hampering
its
progress
i
must
go
overboard
do
you
think
i
could
go
through
the
world
bearing
the
burden
of
a
spoiled
life
brooding
for
ever
over
the
happiness
which
i
have
forfeited
by
my
past
i
must
throw
up
the
game
john
rosmer
if
you
go
then
i
go
with
you
rebecca
looks
at
him
with
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
and
says
more
gently
yes
come
with
me
dear
and
be
witness
rosmer
i
go
with
you
i
said
rebecca
as
far
as
the
bridge
yes
you
never
dare
go
out
on
to
it
you
know
rosmer
have
you
noticed
that
rebecca
in
sad
and
broken
tones
yes
that
was
what
made
my
love
hopeless
rosmer
rebecca
now
i
lay
my
hand
on
your
head
does
as
he
says
and
i
take
you
for
my
true
and
lawful
wife
rebecca
taking
both
his
hands
in
hers
and
bowing
her
head
on
to
his
breast
thank
you
john
lets
him
go
and
now
i
am
going
gladly
rosmer
man
and
wife
should
go
together
rebecca
only
as
far
as
the
bridge
john
rosmer
and
out
on
to
it
too
as
far
as
you
go
so
far
i
go
with
you
i
dare
do
it
now
rebecca
are
you
absolutely
certain
that
way
is
the
best
for
you
rosmer
i
know
it
is
the
only
way
rebecca
but
suppose
you
are
only
deceiving
yourself
suppose
it
were
only
a
delusion
one
of
these
white
horses
of
rosmersholm
rosmer
it
may
be
so
we
can
never
escape
from
them
we
of
my
race
rebecca
then
stay
john
rosmer
the
man
shall
cleave
to
his
wife
as
the
wife
to
her
husband
rebecca
yes
but
first
tell
me
this
is
it
you
that
go
with
me
or
i
that
go
with
you
rosmer
we
shall
never
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
rebecca
yet
i
should
dearly
like
to
know
rosmer
we
two
go
with
each
other
rebecca
i
with
you
and
you
with
me
rebecca
i
almost
believe
that
is
true
rosmer
for
now
we
two
are
one
rebecca
yes
we
are
one
now
come
we
can
go
gladly
now
they
go
out
hand
in
hand
through
the
hall
and
are
seen
to
turn
to
the
left
the
door
stands
open
after
them
the
room
is
empty
for
a
little
while
then
helseth
opens
the
door
on
the
right
helseth
the
carriage
miss
is
looks
round
the
room
not
here
out
together
at
this
time
of
night
well
well
i
must
say
hm
goes
out
into
the
hall
looks
round
and
comes
in
again
not
sitting
on
the
bench
ah
well
goes
to
the
window
and
looks
out
good
heavens
what
is
that
white
thing
as
i
am
a
living
soul
they
are
both
out
on
the
god
forgive
the
sinful
creatures
if
they
are
not
in
each
other
arms
gives
a
wild
scream
ah
they
are
over
both
of
them
over
into
the
help
help
her
knees
tremble
she
holds
on
shakily
to
the
back
of
a
chair
and
can
scarcely
get
her
words
out
no
no
help
here
the
dead
woman
has
taken
them
