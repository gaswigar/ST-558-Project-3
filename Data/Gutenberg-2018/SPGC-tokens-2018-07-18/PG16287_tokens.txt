preface
in
i
was
asked
by
the
harvard
corporation
to
give
a
few
public
lectures
on
psychology
to
the
cambridge
teachers
the
talks
now
printed
form
the
substance
of
that
course
which
has
since
then
been
delivered
at
various
places
to
various
i
have
found
by
experience
that
what
my
hearers
seem
least
to
relish
is
analytical
technicality
and
what
they
most
care
for
is
concrete
practical
application
so
i
have
gradually
weeded
out
the
former
and
left
the
latter
unreduced
and
now
that
i
have
at
last
written
out
the
lectures
they
contain
a
minimum
of
what
is
deemed
in
psychology
and
are
practical
and
popular
in
the
extreme
some
of
my
colleagues
may
possibly
shake
their
heads
at
this
but
in
taking
my
cue
from
what
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
feeling
of
the
audiences
i
believe
that
i
am
shaping
my
book
so
as
to
satisfy
the
more
genuine
public
need
teachers
of
course
will
miss
the
minute
divisions
subdivisions
and
definitions
the
lettered
and
numbered
headings
the
variations
of
type
and
all
the
other
mechanical
artifices
on
which
they
are
accustomed
to
prop
their
minds
but
my
main
desire
has
been
to
make
them
conceive
and
if
possible
reproduce
sympathetically
in
their
imagination
the
mental
life
of
their
pupil
as
the
sort
of
active
unity
which
he
himself
feels
it
to
be
does
chop
himself
into
distinct
processes
and
compartments
and
it
would
have
frustrated
this
deeper
purpose
of
my
book
to
make
it
look
when
printed
like
a
baedeker
handbook
of
travel
or
a
of
arithmetic
so
far
as
books
printed
like
this
book
force
the
fluidity
of
the
facts
upon
the
young
teacher
attention
so
far
i
am
sure
they
tend
to
do
his
intellect
a
service
even
though
they
may
leave
unsatisfied
a
craving
not
altogether
without
its
legitimate
grounds
for
more
nomenclature
and
subdivisions
readers
acquainted
with
my
larger
books
on
psychology
will
meet
much
familiar
phraseology
in
the
chapters
on
habit
and
memory
i
have
even
copied
several
pages
verbatim
but
i
do
not
know
that
apology
is
needed
for
such
plagiarism
as
this
the
talks
to
students
which
conclude
the
volume
were
written
in
response
to
invitations
to
deliver
to
students
at
colleges
the
first
one
was
to
the
graduating
class
of
the
boston
normal
school
of
gymnastics
properly
it
continues
the
series
of
talks
to
teachers
the
second
and
the
third
address
belong
together
and
continue
another
line
of
thought
i
wish
i
were
able
to
make
the
second
a
certain
blindness
in
human
beings
more
impressive
it
is
more
than
the
mere
piece
of
sentimentalism
which
it
may
seem
to
some
readers
it
connects
itself
with
a
definite
view
of
the
world
and
of
our
moral
relations
to
the
same
those
who
have
done
me
the
honor
of
reading
my
volume
of
philosophic
essays
will
recognize
that
i
mean
the
pluralistic
or
individualistic
philosophy
according
to
that
philosophy
the
truth
is
too
great
for
any
one
actual
mind
even
though
that
mind
be
dubbed
absolute
to
know
the
whole
of
it
the
facts
and
worths
of
life
need
many
cognizers
to
take
them
in
there
is
no
point
of
view
absolutely
public
and
universal
private
and
uncommunicable
perceptions
always
remain
over
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
those
who
look
for
them
from
the
outside
never
know
the
practical
consequence
of
such
a
philosophy
is
the
democratic
respect
for
the
sacredness
of
individuality
is
at
any
rate
the
outward
tolerance
of
whatever
is
not
itself
intolerant
these
phrases
are
so
familiar
that
they
sound
now
rather
dead
in
our
ears
once
they
had
a
passionate
inner
meaning
such
a
passionate
inner
meaning
they
may
easily
acquire
again
if
the
pretension
of
our
nation
to
inflict
its
own
inner
ideals
and
institutions
et
upon
orientals
should
meet
with
a
resistance
as
obdurate
as
so
far
it
has
been
gallant
and
spirited
religiously
and
philosophically
our
ancient
national
doctrine
of
live
and
let
live
may
prove
to
have
a
far
deeper
meaning
than
our
people
now
seem
to
imagine
it
to
possess

makes

talks
to
teachers
i
psychology
and
the
teaching
art
in
the
general
activity
and
uprising
of
ideal
interests
which
every
one
with
an
eye
for
fact
can
discern
all
about
us
in
american
life
there
is
perhaps
no
more
promising
feature
than
the
fermentation
which
for
a
dozen
years
or
more
has
been
going
on
among
the
teachers
in
whatever
sphere
of
education
their
functions
may
lie
there
is
to
be
seen
among
them
a
really
inspiring
amount
of
searching
of
the
heart
about
the
highest
concerns
of
their
profession
the
renovation
of
nations
begins
always
at
the
top
among
the
reflective
members
of
the
state
and
spreads
slowly
outward
and
downward
the
teachers
of
this
country
one
may
say
have
its
future
in
their
hands
the
earnestness
which
they
at
present
show
in
striving
to
enlighten
and
strengthen
themselves
is
an
index
of
the
nation
probabilities
of
advance
in
all
ideal
directions
the
outward
organization
of
education
which
we
have
in
our
united
states
is
perhaps
on
the
whole
the
best
organization
that
exists
in
any
country
the
state
school
systems
give
a
diversity
and
flexibility
an
opportunity
for
experiment
and
keenness
of
competition
nowhere
else
to
be
found
on
such
an
important
scale
the
independence
of
so
many
of
the
colleges
and
universities
the
give
and
take
of
students
and
instructors
between
them
all
their
emulation
and
their
happy
organic
relations
to
the
lower
schools
the
traditions
of
instruction
in
them
evolved
from
the
older
american
and
so
avoiding
on
the
one
hand
the
pure
prevalent
in
germany
and
scotland
which
considers
too
little
the
individual
student
and
yet
not
involving
the
sacrifice
of
the
instructor
to
the
individual
student
which
the
english
tutorial
system
would
seem
too
often
to
entail
all
these
things
to
say
nothing
of
that
coeducation
of
the
sexes
in
whose
benefits
so
many
of
us
heartily
believe
all
these
things
i
say
are
most
happy
features
of
our
scholastic
life
and
from
them
the
most
sanguine
auguries
may
be
drawn
having
so
favorable
an
organization
all
we
need
is
to
impregnate
it
with
geniuses
to
get
superior
men
and
women
working
more
and
more
abundantly
in
it
and
for
it
and
at
it
and
in
a
generation
or
two
america
may
well
lead
the
education
of
the
world
i
must
say
that
i
look
forward
with
no
little
confidence
to
the
day
when
that
shall
be
an
accomplished
fact
no
one
has
profited
more
by
the
fermentation
of
which
i
speak
in
pedagogical
circles
than
we
psychologists
the
desire
of
the
schoolteachers
for
a
completer
professional
training
and
their
aspiration
toward
the
spirit
in
their
work
have
led
them
more
and
more
to
turn
to
us
for
light
on
fundamental
principles
and
in
these
few
hours
which
we
are
to
spend
together
you
look
to
me
i
am
sure
for
information
concerning
the
mind
operations
which
may
enable
you
to
labor
more
easily
and
effectively
in
the
several
schoolrooms
over
which
you
preside
far
be
it
from
me
to
disclaim
for
psychology
all
title
to
such
hopes
psychology
ought
certainly
to
give
the
teacher
radical
help
and
yet
i
confess
that
acquainted
as
i
am
with
the
height
of
some
of
your
expectations
i
feel
a
little
anxious
lest
at
the
end
of
these
simple
talks
of
mine
not
a
few
of
you
may
experience
some
disappointment
at
the
net
results
in
other
words
i
am
not
sure
that
you
may
not
be
indulging
fancies
that
are
just
a
shade
exaggerated
that
would
not
be
altogether
astonishing
for
we
have
been
having
something
like
a
in
psychology
in
this
country
laboratories
and
professorships
have
been
founded
and
reviews
established
the
air
has
been
full
of
rumors
the
editors
of
educational
journals
and
the
arrangers
of
conventions
have
had
to
show
themselves
enterprising
and
on
a
level
with
the
novelties
of
the
day
some
of
the
professors
have
not
been
unwilling
to
and
i
am
not
sure
even
that
the
publishers
have
been
entirely
inert
new
psychology
has
thus
become
a
term
to
conjure
up
portentous
ideas
withal
and
you
teachers
docile
and
receptive
and
aspiring
as
many
of
you
are
have
been
plunged
in
an
atmosphere
of
vague
talk
about
our
science
which
to
a
great
extent
has
been
more
mystifying
than
enlightening
altogether
it
does
seem
as
if
there
were
a
certain
fatality
of
mystification
laid
upon
the
teachers
of
our
day
the
matter
of
their
profession
compact
enough
in
itself
has
to
be
frothed
up
for
them
in
journals
and
institutes
till
its
outlines
often
threaten
to
be
lost
in
a
kind
of
vast
uncertainty
where
the
disciples
are
not
independent
and
enough
and
i
think
that
if
you
teachers
in
the
earlier
grades
have
any
defect
the
slightest
touch
of
a
defect
in
the
world
it
is
that
you
are
a
mite
too
docile
we
are
pretty
sure
to
miss
accuracy
and
balance
and
measure
in
those
who
get
a
license
to
lay
down
the
law
to
them
from
above
as
regards
this
subject
of
psychology
now
i
wish
at
the
very
threshold
to
do
what
i
can
to
dispel
the
mystification
so
i
say
at
once
that
in
my
humble
opinion
there
no
psychology
worthy
of
the
name
there
is
nothing
but
the
old
psychology
which
began
in
locke
time
plus
a
little
physiology
of
the
brain
and
senses
and
theory
of
evolution
and
a
few
refinements
of
introspective
detail
for
the
most
part
without
adaptation
to
the
teacher
use
it
is
only
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
psychology
which
are
of
real
value
to
the
teacher
and
they
apart
from
the
aforesaid
theory
of
evolution
are
very
far
from
being
i
trust
that
you
will
see
better
what
i
mean
by
this
at
the
end
of
all
these
talks
i
say
moreover
that
you
make
a
great
a
very
great
mistake
if
you
think
that
psychology
being
the
science
of
the
mind
laws
is
something
from
which
you
can
deduce
definite
programmes
and
schemes
and
methods
of
instruction
for
immediate
schoolroom
use
psychology
is
a
science
and
teaching
is
an
art
and
sciences
never
generate
arts
directly
out
of
themselves
an
intermediary
inventive
mind
must
make
the
application
by
using
its
originality
the
science
of
logic
never
made
a
man
reason
rightly
and
the
science
of
ethics
if
there
be
such
a
thing
never
made
a
man
behave
rightly
the
most
such
sciences
can
do
is
to
help
us
to
catch
ourselves
up
and
check
ourselves
if
we
start
to
reason
or
to
behave
wrongly
and
to
criticise
ourselves
more
articulately
after
we
have
made
mistakes
a
science
only
lays
down
lines
within
which
the
rules
of
the
art
must
fall
laws
which
the
follower
of
the
art
must
not
transgress
but
what
particular
thing
he
shall
positively
do
within
those
lines
is
left
exclusively
to
his
own
genius
one
genius
will
do
his
work
well
and
succeed
in
one
way
while
another
succeeds
as
well
quite
differently
yet
neither
will
transgress
the
lines
the
art
of
teaching
grew
up
in
the
schoolroom
out
of
inventiveness
and
sympathetic
concrete
observation
even
where
as
in
the
case
of
herbart
the
advancer
of
the
art
was
also
a
psychologist
the
pedagogics
and
the
psychology
ran
side
by
side
and
the
former
was
not
derived
in
any
sense
from
the
latter
the
two
were
congruent
but
neither
was
subordinate
and
so
everywhere
the
teaching
must
with
the
psychology
but
need
not
necessarily
be
the
only
kind
of
teaching
that
would
so
agree
for
many
diverse
methods
of
teaching
may
equally
well
agree
with
psychological
laws
to
know
psychology
therefore
is
absolutely
no
guarantee
that
we
shall
be
good
teachers
to
advance
to
that
result
we
must
have
an
additional
endowment
altogether
a
happy
tact
and
ingenuity
to
tell
us
what
definite
things
to
say
and
do
when
the
pupil
is
before
us
that
ingenuity
in
meeting
and
pursuing
the
pupil
that
tact
for
the
concrete
situation
though
they
are
the
alpha
and
omega
of
the
teacher
art
are
things
to
which
psychology
can
not
help
us
in
the
least
the
science
of
psychology
and
whatever
science
of
general
pedagogics
may
be
based
on
it
are
in
fact
much
like
the
science
of
war
nothing
is
simpler
or
more
definite
than
the
principles
of
either
in
war
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
work
your
enemy
into
a
position
from
which
the
natural
obstacles
prevent
him
from
escaping
if
he
tries
to
then
to
fall
on
him
in
numbers
superior
to
his
own
at
a
moment
when
you
have
led
him
to
think
you
far
away
and
so
with
a
minimum
of
exposure
of
your
own
troops
to
hack
his
force
to
pieces
and
take
the
remainder
prisoners
just
so
in
teaching
you
must
simply
work
your
pupil
into
such
a
state
of
interest
in
what
you
are
going
to
teach
him
that
every
other
object
of
attention
is
banished
from
his
mind
then
reveal
it
to
him
so
impressively
that
he
will
remember
the
occasion
to
his
dying
day
and
finally
fill
him
with
devouring
curiosity
to
know
what
the
next
steps
in
connection
with
the
subject
are
the
principles
being
so
plain
there
would
be
nothing
but
victories
for
the
masters
of
the
science
either
on
the
battlefield
or
in
the
schoolroom
if
they
did
not
both
have
to
make
their
application
to
an
incalculable
quantity
in
the
shape
of
the
mind
of
their
opponent
the
mind
of
your
own
enemy
the
pupil
is
working
away
from
you
as
keenly
and
eagerly
as
is
the
mind
of
the
commander
on
the
other
side
from
the
scientific
general
just
what
the
respective
enemies
want
and
think
and
what
they
know
and
do
not
know
are
as
hard
things
for
the
teacher
as
for
the
general
to
find
out
divination
and
perception
not
psychological
pedagogics
or
theoretic
strategy
are
the
only
helpers
here
but
if
the
use
of
psychological
principles
thus
be
negative
rather
than
positive
it
does
not
follow
that
it
may
not
be
a
great
use
all
the
same
it
certainly
narrows
the
path
for
experiments
and
trials
we
know
in
advance
if
we
are
psychologists
that
certain
methods
will
be
wrong
so
our
psychology
saves
us
from
mistakes
it
makes
us
moreover
more
clear
as
to
what
we
are
about
we
gain
confidence
in
respect
to
any
method
which
we
are
using
as
soon
as
we
believe
that
it
has
theory
as
well
as
practice
at
its
back
most
of
all
it
fructifies
our
independence
and
it
reanimates
our
interest
to
see
our
subject
at
two
different
angles
to
get
a
stereoscopic
view
so
to
speak
of
the
youthful
organism
who
is
our
enemy
and
while
handling
him
with
all
our
concrete
tact
and
divination
to
be
able
at
the
same
time
to
represent
to
ourselves
the
curious
inner
elements
of
his
mental
machine
such
a
complete
knowledge
as
this
of
the
pupil
at
once
intuitive
and
analytic
is
surely
the
knowledge
at
which
every
teacher
ought
to
aim
fortunately
for
you
teachers
the
elements
of
the
mental
machine
can
be
clearly
apprehended
and
their
workings
easily
grasped
and
as
the
most
general
elements
and
workings
are
just
those
parts
of
psychology
which
the
teacher
finds
most
directly
useful
it
follows
that
the
amount
of
this
science
which
is
necessary
to
all
teachers
need
not
be
very
great
those
who
find
themselves
loving
the
subject
may
go
as
far
as
they
please
and
become
possibly
none
the
worse
teachers
for
the
fact
even
though
in
some
of
them
one
might
apprehend
a
little
loss
of
balance
from
the
tendency
observable
in
all
of
us
to
overemphasize
certain
special
parts
of
a
subject
when
we
are
studying
it
intensely
and
abstractly
but
for
the
great
majority
of
you
a
general
view
is
enough
provided
it
be
a
true
one
and
such
a
general
view
one
may
say
might
almost
be
written
on
the
palm
of
one
hand
least
of
all
need
you
merely
deem
it
part
of
your
duty
to
become
contributors
to
psychological
science
or
to
make
psychological
observations
in
a
methodical
or
responsible
manner
i
fear
that
some
of
the
enthusiasts
for
have
thrown
a
certain
burden
on
you
in
this
way
by
all
means
let
go
on
it
is
refreshing
all
our
sense
of
the
child
life
there
are
teachers
who
take
a
spontaneous
delight
in
filling
syllabuses
inscribing
observations
compiling
statistics
and
computing
the
per
cent
will
certainly
enrich
their
lives
and
if
its
results
as
treated
statistically
would
seem
on
the
whole
to
have
but
trifling
value
yet
the
anecdotes
and
observations
of
which
it
in
part
consist
do
certainly
acquaint
us
more
intimately
with
our
pupils
our
eyes
and
ears
grow
quickened
to
discern
in
the
child
before
us
processes
similar
to
those
we
have
read
of
as
noted
in
the
children
processes
of
which
we
might
otherwise
have
remained
inobservant
but
for
heaven
sake
let
the
rank
and
file
of
teachers
be
passive
readers
if
they
so
prefer
and
feel
free
not
to
contribute
to
the
accumulation
let
not
the
prosecution
of
it
be
preached
as
an
imperative
duty
or
imposed
by
regulation
on
those
to
whom
it
proves
an
exterminating
bore
or
who
in
any
way
whatever
miss
in
themselves
the
appropriate
vocation
for
it
i
can
not
too
strongly
agree
with
my
colleague
professor
münsterberg
when
he
says
that
the
teacher
attitude
toward
the
child
being
concrete
and
ethical
is
positively
opposed
to
the
psychological
observer
which
is
abstract
and
analytic
although
some
of
us
may
conjoin
the
attitudes
successfully
in
most
of
us
they
must
conflict
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
a
good
teacher
is
to
get
a
bad
conscience
about
her
profession
because
she
feels
herself
hopeless
as
a
psychologist
our
teachers
are
overworked
already
every
one
who
adds
a
jot
or
tittle
of
unnecessary
weight
to
their
burden
is
a
foe
of
education
a
bad
conscience
increases
the
weight
of
every
other
burden
yet
i
know
that
and
other
pieces
of
psychology
as
well
have
been
productive
of
bad
conscience
in
many
a
really
innocent
pedagogic
breast
i
should
indeed
be
glad
if
this
passing
word
from
me
might
tend
to
dispel
such
a
bad
conscience
if
any
of
you
have
it
for
it
is
certainly
one
of
those
fruits
of
more
or
less
systematic
mystification
of
which
i
have
already
complained
the
best
teacher
may
be
the
poorest
contributor
of
material
and
the
best
contributor
may
be
the
poorest
teacher
no
fact
is
more
palpable
than
this
so
much
for
what
seems
the
most
reasonable
general
attitude
of
the
teacher
toward
the
subject
which
is
to
occupy
our
attention
ii
the
stream
of
consciousness
i
said
a
few
minutes
ago
that
the
most
general
elements
and
workings
of
the
mind
are
all
that
the
teacher
absolutely
needs
to
be
acquainted
with
for
his
purposes
now
the
fact
which
psychology
the
science
of
mind
has
to
study
is
also
the
most
general
fact
it
is
the
fact
that
in
each
of
us
when
awake
and
often
when
asleep
kind
of
consciousness
is
always
going
there
is
a
stream
a
succession
of
states
or
waves
or
fields
or
of
whatever
you
please
to
call
them
of
knowledge
of
feeling
of
desire
of
deliberation
that
constantly
pass
and
repass
and
that
constitute
our
inner
life
the
existence
of
this
stream
is
the
primal
fact
the
nature
and
origin
of
it
form
the
essential
problem
of
our
science
so
far
as
we
class
the
states
or
fields
of
consciousness
write
down
their
several
natures
analyze
their
contents
into
elements
or
trace
their
habits
of
succession
we
are
on
the
descriptive
or
analytic
level
so
far
as
we
ask
where
they
come
from
or
why
they
are
just
what
they
are
we
are
on
the
explanatory
level
in
these
talks
with
you
i
shall
entirely
neglect
the
questions
that
come
up
on
the
explanatory
level
it
must
be
frankly
confessed
that
in
no
fundamental
sense
do
we
know
where
our
successive
fields
of
consciousness
come
from
or
why
they
have
the
precise
inner
constitution
which
they
do
have
they
certainly
follow
or
accompany
our
brain
states
and
of
course
their
special
forms
are
determined
by
our
past
experiences
and
education
but
if
we
ask
just
the
brain
conditions
them
we
have
not
the
remotest
inkling
of
an
answer
to
give
and
if
we
ask
just
how
the
education
moulds
the
brain
we
can
speak
but
in
the
most
abstract
general
and
conjectural
terms
on
the
other
hand
if
we
should
say
that
they
are
due
to
a
spiritual
being
called
our
soul
which
reacts
on
our
brain
states
by
these
peculiar
forms
of
spiritual
energy
our
words
would
be
familiar
enough
it
is
true
but
i
think
you
will
agree
that
they
would
offer
little
genuine
explanatory
meaning
the
truth
is
that
we
really
not
the
answers
to
the
problems
on
the
explanatory
level
even
though
in
some
directions
of
inquiry
there
may
be
promising
speculations
to
be
found
for
our
present
purposes
i
shall
therefore
dismiss
them
entirely
and
turn
to
mere
description
this
state
of
things
was
what
i
had
in
mind
when
a
moment
ago
i
said
there
was
no
psychology
worthy
of
the
name
have
thus
fields
of
that
is
the
first
general
fact
and
the
second
general
fact
is
that
the
concrete
fields
are
always
complex
they
contain
sensations
of
our
bodies
and
of
the
objects
around
us
memories
of
past
experiences
and
thoughts
of
distant
things
feelings
of
satisfaction
and
dissatisfaction
desires
and
aversions
and
other
emotional
conditions
together
with
determinations
of
the
will
in
every
variety
of
permutation
and
combination
in
most
of
our
concrete
states
of
consciousness
all
these
different
classes
of
ingredients
are
found
simultaneously
present
to
some
degree
though
the
relative
proportion
they
bear
to
one
another
is
very
shifting
one
state
will
seem
to
be
composed
of
hardly
anything
but
sensations
another
of
hardly
anything
but
memories
etc
but
around
the
sensation
if
one
consider
carefully
there
will
always
be
some
fringe
of
thought
or
will
and
around
the
memory
some
margin
or
penumbra
of
emotion
or
sensation
in
most
of
our
fields
of
consciousness
there
is
a
core
of
sensation
that
is
very
pronounced
you
for
example
now
although
you
are
also
thinking
and
feeling
are
getting
through
your
eyes
sensations
of
my
face
and
figure
and
through
your
ears
sensations
of
my
voice
the
sensations
are
the
or
the
thoughts
and
feelings
the
of
your
actually
present
conscious
field
on
the
other
hand
some
object
of
thought
some
distant
image
may
have
become
the
focus
of
your
mental
attention
even
while
i
am
speaking
your
mind
in
short
may
have
wandered
from
the
lecture
and
in
that
case
the
sensations
of
my
face
and
voice
although
not
absolutely
vanishing
from
your
conscious
field
may
have
taken
up
there
a
very
faint
and
marginal
place
again
to
take
another
sort
of
variation
some
feeling
connected
with
your
own
body
may
have
passed
from
a
marginal
to
a
focal
place
even
while
i
speak
the
expressions
object
and
object
which
we
owe
to
lloyd
morgan
require
i
think
no
further
explanation
the
distinction
they
embody
is
a
very
important
one
and
they
are
the
first
technical
terms
which
i
shall
ask
you
to
remember
in
the
successive
mutations
of
our
fields
of
consciousness
the
process
by
which
one
dissolves
into
another
is
often
very
gradual
and
all
sorts
of
inner
rearrangements
of
contents
occur
sometimes
the
focus
remains
but
little
changed
while
the
margin
alters
rapidly
sometimes
the
focus
alters
and
the
margin
stays
sometimes
focus
and
margin
change
places
sometimes
again
abrupt
alterations
of
the
whole
field
occur
there
can
seldom
be
a
sharp
description
all
we
know
is
that
for
the
most
part
each
field
has
a
sort
of
practical
unity
for
its
possessor
and
that
from
this
practical
point
of
view
we
can
class
a
field
with
other
fields
similar
to
it
by
calling
it
a
state
of
emotion
of
perplexity
of
sensation
of
abstract
thought
of
volition
and
the
like
vague
and
hazy
as
such
an
account
of
our
stream
of
consciousness
may
be
it
is
at
least
secure
from
positive
error
and
free
from
admixture
of
conjecture
or
hypothesis
an
influential
school
of
psychology
seeking
to
avoid
haziness
of
outline
has
tried
to
make
things
appear
more
exact
and
scientific
by
making
the
analysis
more
sharp
the
various
fields
of
consciousness
according
to
this
school
result
from
a
definite
number
of
perfectly
definite
elementary
mental
states
mechanically
associated
into
a
mosaic
or
chemically
combined
according
to
some
thinkers
spencer
for
example
or
taine
these
resolve
themselves
at
last
into
little
elementary
psychic
particles
or
atoms
of
out
of
which
all
the
more
immediately
known
mental
states
are
said
to
be
built
up
locke
introduced
this
theory
in
a
somewhat
vague
form
simple
of
sensation
and
reflection
as
he
called
them
were
for
him
the
bricks
of
which
our
mental
architecture
is
built
up
if
i
ever
have
to
refer
to
this
theory
again
i
shall
refer
to
it
as
the
theory
of
but
i
shall
try
to
steer
clear
of
it
altogether
whether
it
be
true
or
false
it
is
at
any
rate
only
conjectural
and
for
your
practical
purposes
as
teachers
the
more
unpretending
conception
of
the
stream
of
consciousness
with
its
total
waves
or
fields
incessantly
changing
will
amply
suffice
a
a
in
the
light
of
some
of
the
expectations
that
are
abroad
concerning
the
psychology
it
is
instructive
to
read
the
unusually
candid
confession
of
its
founder
wundt
after
his
thirty
years
of
the
service
which
it
the
experimental
method
can
yield
consists
essentially
in
perfecting
our
inner
observation
or
rather
as
i
believe
in
making
this
really
possible
in
any
exact
sense
well
has
our
experimental
so
understood
already
accomplished
aught
of
importance
no
general
answer
to
this
question
can
be
given
because
in
the
unfinished
state
of
our
science
there
is
even
inside
of
the
experimental
lines
of
inquiry
no
universally
accepted
body
of
psychologic
doctrine
in
such
a
discord
of
opinions
comprehensible
enough
at
a
time
of
uncertain
and
groping
development
the
individual
inquirer
can
only
tell
for
what
views
and
insights
he
himself
has
to
thank
the
newer
methods
and
if
i
were
asked
in
what
for
me
the
worth
of
experimental
observation
in
psychology
has
consisted
and
still
consists
i
should
say
that
it
has
given
me
an
entirely
new
idea
of
the
nature
and
connection
of
our
inner
processes
i
learned
in
the
achievements
of
the
sense
of
sight
to
apprehend
the
fact
of
creative
mental
synthesis
from
my
inquiry
into
i
attained
an
insight
into
the
close
union
of
all
those
psychic
functions
usually
separated
by
artificial
abstractions
and
names
such
as
ideation
feeling
will
and
i
saw
the
indivisibility
and
inner
homogeneity
in
all
its
phases
of
the
mental
life
the
chronometric
study
of
finally
showed
me
that
the
notion
of
distinct
mental
was
one
of
those
numerous
which
are
no
sooner
stamped
in
a
verbal
term
than
they
forthwith
thrust
fictions
into
the
place
of
the
reality
i
learned
to
understand
an
as
a
process
no
less
melting
and
fleeting
than
an
act
of
feeling
or
of
will
and
i
comprehended
the
older
doctrine
of
association
of
to
be
no
longer
tenable
besides
all
this
experimental
observation
yielded
much
other
information
about
the
span
of
consciousness
the
rapidity
of
certain
processes
the
exact
numerical
value
of
certain
psychophysical
data
and
the
like
but
i
hold
all
these
more
special
results
to
be
relatively
insignificant
and
by
no
means
the
important
thing
x
the
whole
passage
should
be
read
as
i
interpret
it
it
amounts
to
a
complete
espousal
of
the
vaguer
conception
of
the
stream
of
thought
and
a
complete
renunciation
of
the
whole
business
still
so
industriously
carried
on
in
of
chopping
up
mind
into
distinct
units
of
composition
or
function
numbering
these
off
and
labelling
them
by
technical
names
iii
the
child
as
a
behaving
organism
i
wish
now
to
continue
the
description
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
stream
of
consciousness
by
asking
whether
we
can
in
any
intelligible
way
assign
its
it
has
two
functions
that
are
obvious
it
leads
to
knowledge
and
it
leads
to
action
can
we
say
which
of
these
functions
is
the
more
essential
an
old
historic
divergence
of
opinion
comes
in
here
popular
belief
has
always
tended
to
estimate
the
worth
of
a
man
mental
processes
by
their
effects
upon
his
practical
life
but
philosophers
have
usually
cherished
a
different
view
man
supreme
glory
they
have
said
is
to
be
a
being
to
know
absolute
and
eternal
and
universal
truth
the
uses
of
his
intellect
for
practical
affairs
are
therefore
subordinate
matters
theoretic
life
is
his
soul
genuine
concern
nothing
can
be
more
different
in
its
results
for
our
personal
attitude
than
to
take
sides
with
one
or
the
other
of
these
views
and
emphasize
the
practical
or
the
theoretical
ideal
in
the
latter
case
abstraction
from
the
emotions
and
passions
and
withdrawal
from
the
strife
of
human
affairs
would
be
not
only
pardonable
but
praiseworthy
and
all
that
makes
for
quiet
and
contemplation
should
be
regarded
as
conducive
to
the
highest
human
perfection
in
the
former
the
man
of
contemplation
would
be
treated
as
only
half
a
human
being
passion
and
practical
resource
would
become
once
more
glories
of
our
race
a
concrete
victory
over
this
earth
outward
powers
of
darkness
would
appear
an
equivalent
for
any
amount
of
passive
spiritual
culture
and
conduct
would
remain
as
the
test
of
every
education
worthy
of
the
name
it
is
impossible
to
disguise
the
fact
that
in
the
psychology
of
our
own
day
the
emphasis
is
transferred
from
the
mind
purely
rational
function
where
plato
and
aristotle
and
what
one
may
call
the
whole
classic
tradition
in
philosophy
had
placed
it
to
the
so
long
neglected
practical
side
the
theory
of
evolution
is
mainly
responsible
for
this
man
we
now
have
reason
to
believe
has
been
evolved
from
ancestors
in
whom
pure
reason
hardly
existed
if
at
all
and
whose
mind
so
far
as
it
can
have
had
any
function
would
appear
to
have
been
an
organ
for
adapting
their
movements
to
the
impressions
received
from
the
environment
so
as
to
escape
the
better
from
destruction
consciousness
would
thus
seem
in
the
first
instance
to
be
nothing
but
a
sort
of
biological
perfection
useless
unless
it
prompted
to
useful
conduct
and
inexplicable
apart
from
that
consideration
deep
in
our
own
nature
the
biological
foundations
of
our
consciousness
persist
undisguised
and
undiminished
our
sensations
are
here
to
attract
us
or
to
deter
us
our
memories
to
warn
or
encourage
us
our
feelings
to
impel
and
our
thoughts
to
restrain
our
behavior
so
that
on
the
whole
we
may
prosper
and
our
days
be
long
in
the
land
whatever
of
transmundane
metaphysical
insight
or
of
practically
inapplicable
æsthetic
perception
or
ethical
sentiment
we
may
carry
in
our
interiors
might
at
this
rate
be
regarded
as
only
part
of
the
incidental
excess
of
function
that
necessarily
accompanies
the
working
of
every
complex
machine
i
shall
ask
you
now
not
meaning
at
all
thereby
to
close
the
theoretic
question
but
merely
because
it
seems
to
me
the
point
of
view
likely
to
be
of
greatest
practical
use
to
you
as
teachers
to
adopt
with
me
in
this
course
of
lectures
the
biological
conception
as
thus
expressed
and
to
lay
your
own
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
man
whatever
else
he
may
be
is
primarily
a
practical
being
whose
mind
is
given
him
to
aid
in
adapting
him
to
this
world
life
in
the
learning
of
all
matters
we
have
to
start
with
some
one
deep
aspect
of
the
question
abstracting
it
as
if
it
were
the
only
aspect
and
then
we
gradually
correct
ourselves
by
adding
those
neglected
other
features
which
complete
the
case
no
one
believes
more
strongly
than
i
do
that
what
our
senses
know
as
world
is
only
one
portion
of
our
mind
total
environment
and
object
yet
because
it
is
the
primal
portion
it
is
the
qua
of
all
the
rest
if
you
grasp
the
facts
about
it
firmly
you
may
proceed
to
higher
regions
undisturbed
as
our
time
must
be
so
short
together
i
prefer
being
elementary
and
fundamental
to
being
complete
so
i
propose
to
you
to
hold
fast
to
the
point
of
view
the
reasons
why
i
call
it
so
fundamental
can
be
easily
told
first
human
and
animal
psychology
thereby
become
less
discontinuous
i
know
that
to
some
of
you
this
will
hardly
seem
an
attractive
reason
but
there
are
others
whom
it
will
affect
second
mental
action
is
conditioned
by
brain
action
and
runs
parallel
therewith
but
the
brain
so
far
as
we
understand
it
is
given
us
for
practical
behavior
every
current
that
runs
into
it
from
skin
or
eye
or
ear
runs
out
again
into
muscles
glands
or
viscera
and
helps
to
adapt
the
animal
to
the
environment
from
which
the
current
came
it
therefore
generalizes
and
simplifies
our
view
to
treat
the
brain
life
and
the
mental
life
as
having
one
fundamental
kind
of
purpose
third
those
very
functions
of
the
mind
that
do
not
refer
directly
to
this
world
environment
the
ethical
utopias
æsthetic
visions
insights
into
eternal
truth
and
fanciful
logical
combinations
could
never
be
carried
on
at
all
by
a
human
individual
unless
the
mind
that
produced
them
in
him
were
also
able
to
produce
more
practically
useful
products
the
latter
are
thus
the
more
essential
or
at
least
the
more
primordial
results
fourth
the
inessential
activities
are
themselves
far
more
connected
with
our
behavior
and
our
adaptation
to
the
environment
than
at
first
sight
might
appear
no
truth
however
abstract
is
ever
perceived
that
will
not
probably
at
some
time
influence
our
earthly
action
you
must
remember
that
when
i
talk
of
action
here
i
mean
action
in
the
widest
sense
i
mean
speech
i
mean
writing
i
mean
yeses
and
noes
and
tendencies
things
and
tendencies
things
and
emotional
determinations
and
i
mean
them
in
the
future
as
well
as
in
the
immediate
present
as
i
talk
here
and
you
listen
it
might
seem
as
if
no
action
followed
you
might
call
it
a
purely
theoretic
process
with
no
practical
result
but
it
have
a
practical
result
it
can
not
take
place
at
all
and
leave
your
conduct
unaffected
if
not
then
on
some
far
future
day
you
will
answer
some
question
differently
by
reason
of
what
you
are
thinking
now
some
of
you
will
be
led
by
my
words
into
new
veins
of
inquiry
into
reading
special
books
these
will
develop
your
opinion
whether
for
or
against
that
opinion
will
in
turn
be
expressed
will
receive
criticism
from
others
in
your
environment
and
will
affect
your
standing
in
their
eyes
we
can
not
escape
our
destiny
which
is
practical
and
even
our
most
theoretic
faculties
contribute
to
its
working
out
these
few
reasons
will
perhaps
smooth
the
way
for
you
to
acquiescence
in
my
proposal
as
teachers
i
sincerely
think
it
will
be
a
sufficient
conception
for
you
to
adopt
of
the
youthful
psychological
phenomena
handed
over
to
your
inspection
if
you
consider
them
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
relation
to
the
future
conduct
of
their
possessor
sufficient
at
any
rate
as
a
first
conception
and
as
a
main
conception
you
should
regard
your
professional
task
as
if
it
consisted
chiefly
and
essentially
in
the
pupil
to
taking
behavior
not
in
the
narrow
sense
of
his
manners
but
in
the
very
widest
possible
sense
as
including
every
possible
sort
of
fit
reaction
on
the
circumstances
into
which
he
may
find
himself
brought
by
the
vicissitudes
of
life
the
reaction
may
indeed
often
be
a
negative
reaction
to
speak
to
move
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
our
duties
in
certain
practical
emergencies
thou
shalt
refrain
renounce
abstain
this
often
requires
a
great
effort
of
will
power
and
physiologically
considered
is
just
as
positive
a
nerve
function
as
is
motor
discharge
iv
education
and
behavior
in
our
foregoing
talk
we
were
led
to
frame
a
very
simple
conception
of
what
an
education
means
in
the
last
analysis
it
consists
in
the
organizing
of
in
the
human
being
of
powers
of
conduct
which
shall
fit
him
to
his
social
and
physical
world
an
person
is
one
who
is
nonplussed
by
all
but
the
most
habitual
situations
on
the
contrary
one
who
is
educated
is
able
practically
to
extricate
himself
by
means
of
the
examples
with
which
his
memory
is
stored
and
of
the
abstract
conceptions
which
he
has
acquired
from
circumstances
in
which
he
never
was
placed
before
education
in
short
can
not
be
better
described
than
by
calling
it
organization
of
acquired
habits
of
conduct
and
tendencies
to
to
illustrate
you
and
i
are
each
and
all
of
us
educated
in
our
several
ways
and
we
show
our
education
at
this
present
moment
by
different
conduct
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
me
with
my
mind
technically
and
professionally
organized
as
it
is
and
with
the
optical
stimulus
which
your
presence
affords
to
remain
sitting
here
entirely
silent
and
inactive
something
tells
me
that
i
am
expected
to
speak
and
must
speak
something
forces
me
to
keep
on
speaking
my
organs
of
articulation
are
continuously
innervated
by
outgoing
currents
which
the
currents
passing
inward
at
my
eyes
and
through
my
educated
brain
have
set
in
motion
and
the
particular
movements
which
they
make
have
their
form
and
order
determined
altogether
by
the
training
of
all
my
past
years
of
lecturing
and
reading
your
conduct
on
the
other
hand
might
seem
at
first
sight
purely
receptive
and
inactive
leaving
out
those
among
you
who
happen
to
be
taking
notes
but
the
very
listening
which
you
are
carrying
on
is
itself
a
determinate
kind
of
conduct
all
the
muscular
tensions
of
your
body
are
distributed
in
a
peculiar
way
as
you
listen
your
head
your
eyes
are
fixed
characteristically
and
when
the
lecture
is
over
it
will
inevitably
eventuate
in
some
stroke
of
behavior
as
i
said
on
the
previous
occasion
you
may
be
guided
differently
in
some
special
emergency
in
the
schoolroom
by
words
which
i
now
let
so
it
is
with
the
impressions
you
will
make
there
on
your
pupil
you
should
get
into
the
habit
of
regarding
them
all
as
leading
to
the
acquisition
by
him
of
capacities
for
behavior
emotional
social
bodily
vocal
technical
or
what
not
and
this
being
the
case
you
ought
to
feel
willing
in
a
general
way
and
without
or
farther
ado
to
take
up
for
the
purposes
of
these
lectures
with
the
biological
conception
of
the
mind
as
of
something
given
us
for
practical
use
that
conception
will
certainly
cover
the
greater
part
of
your
own
educational
work
if
we
reflect
upon
the
various
ideals
of
education
that
are
prevalent
in
the
different
countries
we
see
that
what
they
all
aim
at
is
to
organize
capacities
for
conduct
this
is
most
immediately
obvious
in
germany
where
the
explicitly
avowed
aim
of
the
higher
education
is
to
turn
the
student
into
an
instrument
for
advancing
scientific
discovery
the
german
universities
are
proud
of
the
number
of
young
specialists
whom
they
turn
out
every
year
not
necessarily
men
of
any
original
force
of
intellect
but
men
so
trained
to
research
that
when
their
professor
gives
them
an
historical
or
philological
thesis
to
prepare
or
a
bit
of
laboratory
work
to
do
with
a
general
indication
as
to
the
best
method
they
can
go
off
by
themselves
and
use
apparatus
and
consult
sources
in
such
a
way
as
to
grind
out
in
the
requisite
number
of
months
some
little
of
new
truth
worthy
of
being
added
to
the
store
of
extant
human
information
on
that
subject
little
else
is
recognized
in
germany
as
a
man
title
to
academic
advancement
than
his
ability
thus
to
show
himself
an
efficient
instrument
of
research
in
england
it
might
seem
at
first
sight
as
if
the
higher
education
of
the
universities
aimed
at
the
production
of
certain
static
types
of
character
rather
than
at
the
development
of
what
one
may
call
this
dynamic
scientific
efficiency
professor
jowett
when
asked
what
oxford
could
do
for
its
students
is
said
to
have
replied
oxford
can
teach
an
english
gentleman
how
to
an
english
gentleman
but
if
you
ask
what
it
means
to
an
english
gentleman
the
only
reply
is
in
terms
of
conduct
and
behavior
an
english
gentleman
is
a
bundle
of
specifically
qualified
reactions
a
creature
who
for
all
the
emergencies
of
life
has
his
line
of
behavior
distinctly
marked
out
for
him
in
advance
here
as
elsewhere
england
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
the
necessity
of
reactions
if
all
this
be
true
then
immediately
one
general
aphorism
emerges
which
ought
by
logical
right
to
dominate
the
entire
conduct
of
the
teacher
in
the
classroom
reception
without
reaction
no
impression
without
correlative
this
is
the
great
maxim
which
the
teacher
ought
never
to
forget
an
impression
which
simply
flows
in
at
the
pupil
eyes
or
ears
and
in
no
way
modifies
his
active
life
is
an
impression
gone
to
waste
it
is
physiologically
incomplete
it
leaves
no
fruits
behind
it
in
the
way
of
capacity
acquired
even
as
mere
impression
it
fails
to
produce
its
proper
effect
upon
the
memory
for
to
remain
fully
among
the
acquisitions
of
this
latter
faculty
it
must
be
wrought
into
the
whole
cycle
of
our
operations
its
are
what
clinch
it
some
effect
due
to
it
in
the
way
of
an
activity
must
return
to
the
mind
in
the
form
of
the
of
having
and
connect
itself
with
the
impression
the
most
durable
impressions
are
those
on
account
of
which
we
speak
or
act
or
else
are
inwardly
convulsed
the
older
pedagogic
method
of
learning
things
by
rote
and
reciting
them
in
the
schoolroom
rested
on
the
truth
that
a
thing
merely
read
or
heard
and
never
verbally
reproduced
contracts
the
weakest
possible
adhesion
in
the
mind
verbal
recitation
or
reproduction
is
thus
a
highly
important
kind
of
reactive
behavior
on
our
impressions
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
in
the
reaction
against
the
old
as
the
beginning
and
end
of
instruction
the
extreme
value
of
verbal
recitation
as
an
element
of
complete
training
may
nowadays
be
too
much
forgotten
when
we
turn
to
modern
pedagogics
we
see
how
enormously
the
field
of
reactive
conduct
has
been
extended
by
the
introduction
of
all
those
methods
of
concrete
object
teaching
which
are
the
glory
of
our
contemporary
schools
verbal
reactions
useful
as
they
are
are
insufficient
the
pupil
words
may
be
right
but
the
conceptions
corresponding
to
them
are
often
direfully
wrong
in
a
modern
school
therefore
they
form
only
a
small
part
of
what
the
pupil
is
required
to
do
he
must
keep
notebooks
make
drawings
plans
and
maps
take
measurements
enter
the
laboratory
and
perform
experiments
consult
authorities
and
write
essays
he
must
do
in
his
fashion
what
is
often
laughed
at
by
outsiders
when
it
appears
in
prospectuses
under
the
title
of
work
but
what
is
really
the
only
possible
training
for
the
doing
of
original
work
thereafter
the
most
colossal
improvement
which
recent
years
have
seen
in
secondary
education
lies
in
the
introduction
of
the
manual
training
schools
not
because
they
will
give
us
a
people
more
handy
and
practical
for
domestic
life
and
better
skilled
in
trades
but
because
they
will
give
us
citizens
with
an
entirely
different
intellectual
fibre
laboratory
work
and
shop
work
engender
a
habit
of
observation
a
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
accuracy
and
vagueness
and
an
insight
into
nature
complexity
and
into
the
inadequacy
of
all
abstract
verbal
accounts
of
real
phenomena
which
once
wrought
into
the
mind
remain
there
as
lifelong
possessions
they
confer
precision
because
if
you
are
a
thing
you
must
do
it
definitely
right
or
definitely
wrong
they
give
honesty
for
when
you
express
yourself
by
making
things
and
not
by
using
words
it
becomes
impossible
to
dissimulate
your
vagueness
or
ignorance
by
ambiguity
they
beget
a
habit
of
they
keep
the
interest
and
attention
always
cheerfully
engaged
and
reduce
the
disciplinary
functions
to
a
minimum
of
the
various
systems
of
manual
training
so
far
as
woodwork
is
concerned
the
swedish
sloyd
system
if
i
may
have
an
opinion
on
such
matters
seems
to
me
by
far
the
best
psychologically
considered
manual
training
methods
fortunately
are
being
slowly
but
surely
introduced
into
all
our
large
cities
but
there
is
still
an
immense
distance
to
traverse
before
they
shall
have
gained
the
extension
which
they
are
destined
ultimately
to
possess
no
impression
without
expression
then
that
is
the
first
pedagogic
fruit
of
our
evolutionary
conception
of
the
mind
as
something
instrumental
to
adaptive
behavior
but
a
word
may
be
said
in
continuation
the
expression
itself
comes
back
to
us
as
i
intimated
a
moment
ago
in
the
form
of
a
still
farther
impression
the
impression
namely
of
what
we
have
done
we
thus
receive
sensible
news
of
our
behavior
and
its
results
we
hear
the
words
we
have
spoken
feel
our
own
blow
as
we
give
it
or
read
in
the
bystander
eyes
the
success
or
failure
of
our
conduct
now
this
return
wave
of
impression
pertains
to
the
completeness
of
the
whole
experience
and
a
word
about
its
importance
in
the
schoolroom
may
not
be
out
of
place
it
would
seem
only
natural
to
say
that
since
after
acting
we
normally
get
some
return
impression
of
result
it
must
be
well
to
let
the
pupil
get
such
a
return
impression
in
every
possible
case
nevertheless
in
schools
where
examination
marks
and
and
other
returns
of
result
are
concealed
the
pupil
is
frustrated
of
this
natural
termination
of
the
cycle
of
his
activities
and
often
suffers
from
the
sense
of
incompleteness
and
uncertainty
and
there
are
persons
who
defend
this
system
as
encouraging
the
pupil
to
work
for
the
work
sake
and
not
for
extraneous
reward
of
course
here
as
elsewhere
concrete
experience
must
prevail
over
psychological
deduction
but
so
far
as
our
psychological
deduction
goes
it
would
suggest
that
the
eagerness
to
know
how
well
he
does
is
in
the
line
of
his
normal
completeness
of
function
and
should
never
be
balked
except
for
very
definite
reasons
indeed
acquaint
them
therefore
with
their
marks
and
standing
and
prospects
unless
in
the
individual
case
you
have
some
special
practical
reason
for
not
so
doing
vi
native
reactions
and
acquired
reactions
we
are
by
this
time
fully
launched
upon
the
biological
conception
man
is
an
organism
for
reacting
on
impressions
his
mind
is
there
to
help
determine
his
reactions
and
the
purpose
of
his
education
is
to
make
them
numerous
and
perfect
education
means
in
short
little
more
than
a
mass
of
possibilities
of
reaction
acquired
at
home
at
school
or
in
the
training
of
affairs
the
teacher
task
is
that
of
supervising
the
acquiring
process
this
being
the
case
i
will
immediately
state
a
principle
which
underlies
the
whole
process
of
acquisition
and
governs
the
entire
activity
of
the
teacher
it
is
this
acquired
reaction
is
as
a
rule
either
a
complication
grafted
on
a
native
reaction
or
a
substitute
for
a
native
reaction
which
the
same
object
originally
tended
to
teacher
art
consists
in
bringing
about
the
substitution
or
complication
and
success
in
the
art
presupposes
a
sympathetic
acquaintance
with
the
reactive
tendencies
natively
without
an
equipment
of
native
reactions
on
the
child
part
the
teacher
would
have
no
hold
whatever
upon
the
child
attention
or
conduct
you
may
take
a
horse
to
the
water
but
you
can
not
make
him
drink
and
so
you
may
take
a
child
to
the
schoolroom
but
you
can
not
make
him
learn
the
new
things
you
wish
to
impart
except
by
soliciting
him
in
the
first
instance
by
something
which
natively
makes
him
react
he
must
take
the
first
step
himself
he
must
something
before
you
can
get
your
purchase
on
him
that
something
may
be
something
good
or
something
bad
a
bad
reaction
is
better
than
no
reaction
at
all
for
if
bad
you
can
couple
it
with
consequences
which
awake
him
to
its
badness
but
imagine
a
child
so
lifeless
as
to
react
in
way
to
the
first
appeals
and
how
can
you
possibly
take
the
first
step
in
his
education
to
make
this
abstract
conception
more
concrete
assume
the
case
of
a
young
child
training
in
good
manners
the
child
has
a
native
tendency
to
snatch
with
his
hands
at
anything
that
attracts
his
curiosity
also
to
draw
back
his
hands
when
slapped
to
cry
under
these
latter
conditions
to
smile
when
gently
spoken
to
and
to
imitate
gestures
suppose
now
you
appear
before
the
child
with
a
new
toy
intended
as
a
present
for
him
no
sooner
does
he
see
the
toy
than
he
seeks
to
snatch
it
you
slap
the
hand
it
is
withdrawn
and
the
child
cries
you
then
hold
up
the
toy
smiling
and
saying
beg
for
it
nicely
so
the
child
stops
crying
imitates
you
receives
the
toy
and
crows
with
pleasure
and
that
little
cycle
of
training
is
complete
you
have
substituted
the
new
reaction
of
for
the
native
reaction
of
snatching
when
that
kind
of
impression
comes
now
if
the
child
had
no
memory
the
process
would
not
be
educative
no
matter
how
often
you
came
in
with
a
toy
the
same
series
of
reactions
would
fatally
occur
each
called
forth
by
its
own
impression
see
snatch
slap
cry
hear
ask
receive
smile
but
with
memory
there
the
child
at
the
very
instant
of
snatching
recalls
the
rest
of
the
earlier
experience
thinks
of
the
slap
and
the
frustration
recollects
the
begging
and
the
reward
inhibits
the
snatching
impulse
substitutes
the
reaction
for
it
and
gets
the
toy
immediately
by
eliminating
all
the
intermediary
steps
if
a
child
first
snatching
impulse
be
excessive
or
his
memory
poor
many
repetitions
of
the
discipline
may
be
needed
before
the
acquired
reaction
comes
to
be
an
ingrained
habit
but
in
an
eminently
educable
child
a
single
experience
will
suffice
one
can
easily
represent
the
whole
process
by
a
such
a
diagram
can
be
little
more
than
a
symbolic
translation
of
the
immediate
experience
into
spatial
terms
yet
it
may
be
useful
so
i
subjoin
it
illustration
figure
the
before
education
figure
shows
the
paths
of
the
four
successive
reflexes
executed
by
the
lower
or
instinctive
centres
the
dotted
lines
that
lead
from
them
to
the
higher
centres
and
connect
the
latter
together
represent
the
processes
of
memory
and
association
which
the
reactions
impress
upon
the
higher
centres
as
they
take
place
illustration
figure
the
after
education
in
figure
we
have
the
final
result
the
impression
awakens
the
chain
of
memories
and
the
only
reactions
that
take
place
are
the
and
the
thought
of
the
connected
with
the
activity
of
centre
inhibits
the
and
makes
it
abortive
so
it
is
represented
only
by
a
dotted
line
of
discharge
not
reaching
the
terminus
ditto
of
the
reaction
these
are
as
it
were
by
the
current
sweeping
through
the
higher
centres
from
to
and
thus
substituted
for
the
original
reaction
become
at
last
the
immediate
responses
when
the
child
sees
a
snatchable
object
in
some
one
hands
the
first
thing
then
for
the
teacher
to
understand
is
the
native
reactive
tendencies
the
impulses
and
instincts
of
childhood
so
as
to
be
able
to
substitute
one
for
another
and
turn
them
on
to
artificial
objects
it
is
often
said
that
man
is
distinguished
from
the
lower
animals
by
having
a
much
smaller
assortment
of
native
instincts
and
impulses
than
they
but
this
is
a
great
mistake
man
of
course
has
not
the
marvellous
instincts
which
some
articulates
have
but
if
we
compare
him
with
the
mammalia
we
are
forced
to
confess
that
he
is
appealed
to
by
a
much
larger
array
of
objects
than
any
other
mammal
that
his
reactions
on
these
objects
are
characteristic
and
determinate
in
a
very
high
degree
the
monkeys
and
especially
the
anthropoids
are
the
only
beings
that
approach
him
in
their
analytic
curiosity
and
width
of
imitativeness
his
instinctive
impulses
it
is
true
get
overlaid
by
the
secondary
reactions
due
to
his
superior
reasoning
power
but
thus
man
loses
the
instinctive
demeanor
but
the
life
of
instinct
is
only
disguised
in
him
not
lost
and
when
the
higher
are
in
abeyance
as
happens
in
imbecility
or
dementia
his
instincts
sometimes
show
their
presence
in
truly
brutish
ways
i
will
therefore
say
a
few
words
about
those
instinctive
tendencies
which
are
the
most
important
from
the
teacher
point
of
view
vii
what
the
native
reactions
are
first
of
all
fear
of
punishment
has
always
been
the
great
weapon
of
the
teacher
and
will
always
of
course
retain
some
place
in
the
conditions
of
the
schoolroom
the
subject
is
so
familiar
that
nothing
more
need
be
said
about
it
the
same
is
true
of
and
the
instinctive
desire
to
please
those
whom
we
love
the
teacher
who
succeeds
in
getting
herself
loved
by
the
pupils
will
obtain
results
which
one
of
a
more
forbidding
temperament
finds
it
impossible
to
secure
next
a
word
might
be
said
about
this
is
perhaps
a
rather
poor
term
by
which
to
designate
the
toward
better
in
its
full
extent
but
you
will
readily
understand
what
i
mean
novelties
in
the
way
of
sensible
objects
especially
if
their
sensational
quality
is
bright
vivid
startling
invariably
arrest
the
attention
of
the
young
and
hold
it
until
the
desire
to
know
more
about
the
object
is
assuaged
in
its
higher
more
intellectual
form
the
impulse
toward
completer
knowledge
takes
the
character
of
scientific
or
philosophic
curiosity
in
both
its
sensational
and
its
intellectual
form
the
instinct
is
more
vivacious
during
childhood
and
youth
than
in
after
life
young
children
are
possessed
by
curiosity
about
every
new
impression
that
assails
them
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
a
young
child
to
listen
to
a
lecture
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
as
you
are
now
listening
to
me
the
outside
sights
and
sounds
would
inevitably
carry
his
attention
off
and
for
most
people
in
middle
life
the
sort
of
intellectual
effort
required
of
the
average
schoolboy
in
mastering
his
greek
or
latin
lesson
his
algebra
or
physics
would
be
out
of
the
question
the
citizen
attends
exclusively
to
the
routine
details
of
his
business
and
new
truths
especially
when
they
require
involved
trains
of
close
reasoning
are
no
longer
within
the
scope
of
his
capacity
the
sensational
curiosity
of
childhood
is
appealed
to
more
particularly
by
certain
determinate
kinds
of
objects
material
things
things
that
move
living
things
human
actions
and
accounts
of
human
action
will
win
the
attention
better
than
anything
that
is
more
abstract
here
again
comes
in
the
advantage
of
the
and
manual
training
methods
the
pupil
attention
is
spontaneously
held
by
any
problem
that
involves
the
presentation
of
a
new
material
object
or
of
an
activity
on
any
one
part
the
teacher
earliest
appeals
therefore
must
be
through
objects
shown
or
acts
performed
or
described
theoretic
curiosity
curiosity
about
the
rational
relations
between
things
can
hardly
be
said
to
awake
at
all
until
adolescence
is
reached
the
sporadic
metaphysical
inquiries
of
children
as
to
who
made
god
and
why
they
have
five
fingers
need
hardly
be
counted
here
but
when
the
theoretic
instinct
is
once
alive
in
the
pupil
an
entirely
new
order
of
pedagogic
relations
begins
for
him
reasons
causes
abstract
conceptions
suddenly
grow
full
of
zest
a
fact
with
which
all
teachers
are
familiar
and
both
in
its
sensible
and
in
its
rational
developments
disinterested
curiosity
may
be
successfully
appealed
to
in
the
child
with
much
more
certainty
than
in
the
adult
in
whom
this
intellectual
instinct
has
grown
so
torpid
as
usually
never
to
awake
unless
it
enters
into
association
with
some
selfish
personal
interest
of
this
latter
point
i
will
say
more
anon
man
has
always
been
recognized
as
the
imitative
animal
and
there
is
hardly
a
book
on
psychology
however
old
which
has
not
devoted
at
least
one
paragraph
to
this
fact
it
is
strange
however
that
the
full
scope
and
pregnancy
of
the
imitative
impulse
in
man
has
had
to
wait
till
the
last
dozen
years
to
become
adequately
recognized
tarde
led
the
way
in
his
admirably
original
work
les
lois
de
and
in
our
own
country
professors
royce
and
baldwin
have
kept
the
ball
rolling
with
all
the
energy
that
could
be
desired
each
of
us
is
in
fact
what
he
is
almost
exclusively
by
virtue
of
his
imitativeness
we
become
conscious
of
what
we
ourselves
are
by
imitating
others
the
consciousness
of
what
the
others
are
precedes
the
sense
of
self
grows
by
the
sense
of
pattern
the
entire
accumulated
wealth
of
mankind
languages
arts
institutions
and
sciences
is
passed
on
from
one
generation
to
another
by
what
baldwin
has
called
social
heredity
each
generation
simply
imitating
the
last
into
the
particulars
of
this
most
fascinating
chapter
of
psychology
i
have
no
time
to
go
the
moment
one
hears
tarde
proposition
uttered
however
one
feels
how
supremely
true
it
is
invention
using
the
term
most
broadly
and
imitation
are
the
two
legs
so
to
call
them
on
which
the
human
race
historically
has
walked
imitation
shades
imperceptibly
into
emulation
is
the
impulse
to
imitate
what
you
see
another
doing
in
order
not
to
appear
inferior
and
it
is
hard
to
draw
a
sharp
line
between
the
manifestations
of
the
two
impulses
so
inextricably
do
they
mix
their
effects
emulation
is
the
very
nerve
of
human
society
why
are
you
my
hearers
sitting
here
before
me
if
no
one
whom
you
ever
heard
of
had
attended
a
school
or
teachers
institute
would
it
have
occurred
to
any
one
of
you
to
break
out
independently
and
do
a
thing
so
unprescribed
by
fashion
probably
not
nor
would
your
pupils
come
to
you
unless
the
children
of
their
parents
neighbors
were
all
simultaneously
being
sent
to
school
we
wish
not
to
be
lonely
or
eccentric
and
we
wish
not
to
be
cut
off
from
our
share
in
things
which
to
our
neighbors
seem
desirable
privileges
in
the
schoolroom
imitation
and
emulation
play
absolutely
vital
parts
every
teacher
knows
the
advantage
of
having
certain
things
performed
by
whole
bands
of
children
at
a
time
the
teacher
who
meets
with
most
success
is
the
teacher
whose
own
ways
are
the
most
imitable
a
teacher
should
never
try
to
make
the
pupils
do
a
thing
which
she
can
not
do
herself
come
and
let
me
show
you
how
is
an
incomparably
better
stimulus
than
go
and
do
it
as
the
book
directs
children
admire
a
teacher
who
has
skill
what
he
does
seems
easy
and
they
wish
to
emulate
it
it
is
useless
for
a
dull
and
devitalized
teacher
to
exhort
her
pupils
to
wake
up
and
take
an
interest
she
must
first
take
one
herself
then
her
example
is
effective
as
no
exhortation
can
possibly
be
every
school
has
its
tone
moral
and
intellectual
and
this
tone
is
a
mere
tradition
kept
up
by
imitation
due
in
the
first
instance
to
the
example
set
by
teachers
and
by
previous
pupils
of
an
aggressive
and
dominating
type
copied
by
the
others
and
passed
on
from
year
to
year
so
that
the
new
pupils
take
the
cue
almost
immediately
such
a
tone
changes
very
slowly
if
at
all
and
then
always
under
the
modifying
influence
of
new
personalities
aggressive
enough
in
character
to
set
new
patterns
and
not
merely
to
copy
the
old
the
classic
example
of
this
sort
of
tone
is
the
often
quoted
case
of
rugby
under
administration
he
impressed
his
own
character
as
a
model
on
the
imagination
of
the
oldest
boys
who
in
turn
were
expected
and
required
to
impress
theirs
upon
the
younger
set
the
contagiousness
of
genius
was
such
that
a
rugby
man
was
said
to
be
recognizable
all
through
life
by
a
peculiar
turn
of
character
which
he
acquired
at
school
it
is
obvious
that
psychology
as
such
can
give
in
this
field
no
precepts
of
detail
as
in
so
many
other
fields
of
teaching
success
depends
mainly
on
the
native
genius
of
the
teacher
the
sympathy
tact
and
perception
which
enable
him
to
seize
the
right
moment
and
to
set
the
right
example
among
the
recent
modern
reforms
of
teaching
methods
a
certain
disparagement
of
emulation
as
a
laudable
spring
of
action
in
the
schoolroom
has
often
made
itself
heard
more
than
a
century
ago
rousseau
in
his
branded
rivalry
between
one
pupil
and
another
as
too
base
a
passion
to
play
a
part
in
an
ideal
education
let
émile
he
said
never
be
led
to
compare
himself
to
other
children
no
rivalries
not
even
in
running
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
have
the
power
of
reason
it
were
a
hundred
times
better
that
he
should
not
learn
at
all
what
he
could
only
learn
through
jealousy
or
vanity
but
i
would
mark
out
every
year
the
progress
he
may
have
made
and
i
would
compare
it
with
the
progress
of
the
following
years
i
would
say
to
him
are
now
grown
so
many
inches
taller
there
is
the
ditch
which
you
jumped
over
there
is
the
burden
which
you
raised
there
is
the
distance
to
which
you
could
throw
a
pebble
there
the
distance
you
could
run
over
without
losing
breath
see
how
much
more
you
can
do
now
thus
i
should
excite
him
without
making
him
jealous
of
any
one
he
would
wish
to
surpass
himself
i
can
see
no
inconvenience
in
this
emulation
with
his
former
self
unquestionably
emulation
with
one
former
self
is
a
noble
form
of
the
passion
of
rivalry
and
has
a
wide
scope
in
the
training
of
the
young
but
to
veto
and
taboo
all
possible
rivalry
of
one
youth
with
another
because
such
rivalry
may
degenerate
into
greedy
and
selfish
excess
does
seem
to
savor
somewhat
of
sentimentality
or
even
of
fanaticism
the
feeling
of
rivalry
lies
at
the
very
basis
of
our
being
all
social
improvement
being
largely
due
to
it
there
is
a
noble
and
generous
kind
of
rivalry
as
well
as
a
spiteful
and
greedy
kind
and
the
noble
and
generous
form
is
particularly
common
in
childhood
all
games
owe
the
zest
which
they
bring
with
them
to
the
fact
that
they
are
rooted
in
the
emulous
passion
yet
they
are
the
chief
means
of
training
in
fairness
and
magnanimity
can
the
teacher
afford
to
throw
such
an
ally
away
ought
we
seriously
to
hope
that
marks
distinctions
prizes
and
other
goals
of
effort
based
on
the
pursuit
of
recognized
superiority
should
be
forever
banished
from
our
schools
as
a
psychologist
obliged
to
notice
the
deep
and
pervasive
character
of
the
emulous
passion
i
must
confess
my
doubts
the
wise
teacher
will
use
this
instinct
as
he
uses
others
reaping
its
advantages
and
appealing
to
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
reap
a
maximum
of
benefit
with
a
minimum
of
harm
for
after
all
we
must
confess
with
a
french
critic
of
rousseau
doctrine
that
the
deepest
spring
of
action
in
us
is
the
sight
of
action
in
another
the
spectacle
of
effort
is
what
awakens
and
sustains
our
own
effort
no
runner
running
all
alone
on
a
will
find
in
his
own
will
the
power
of
stimulation
which
his
rivalry
with
other
runners
incites
when
he
feels
them
at
his
heels
about
to
pass
when
a
trotting
horse
is
a
running
horse
must
go
beside
him
to
keep
him
to
the
pace
as
imitation
slides
into
emulation
so
emulation
slides
into
and
ambition
connects
itself
closely
with
and
consequently
these
five
instinctive
tendencies
form
an
interconnected
group
of
factors
hard
to
separate
in
the
determination
of
a
great
deal
of
our
conduct
the
would
perhaps
be
the
best
name
for
the
whole
group
pride
and
pugnacity
have
often
been
considered
unworthy
passions
to
appeal
to
in
the
young
but
in
their
more
refined
and
noble
forms
they
play
a
great
part
in
the
schoolroom
and
in
education
generally
being
in
some
characters
most
potent
spurs
to
effort
pugnacity
need
not
be
thought
of
merely
in
the
form
of
physical
combativeness
it
can
be
taken
in
the
sense
of
a
general
unwillingness
to
be
beaten
by
any
kind
of
difficulty
it
is
what
makes
us
feel
and
challenged
by
arduous
achievements
and
is
essential
to
a
spirited
and
enterprising
character
we
have
of
late
been
hearing
much
of
the
philosophy
of
tenderness
in
education
must
be
assiduously
awakened
in
everything
difficulties
must
be
smoothed
away
pedagogics
have
taken
the
place
of
the
old
steep
and
rocky
path
to
learning
but
from
this
lukewarm
air
the
bracing
oxygen
of
effort
is
left
out
it
is
nonsense
to
suppose
that
every
step
in
education
be
interesting
the
fighting
impulse
must
often
be
appealed
to
make
the
pupil
feel
ashamed
of
being
scared
at
fractions
of
being
by
the
law
of
falling
bodies
rouse
his
pugnacity
and
pride
and
he
will
rush
at
the
difficult
places
with
a
sort
of
inner
wrath
at
himself
that
is
one
of
his
best
moral
faculties
a
victory
scored
under
such
conditions
becomes
a
and
crisis
of
his
character
it
represents
the
mark
of
his
powers
and
serves
thereafter
as
an
ideal
pattern
for
his
the
teacher
who
never
rouses
this
sort
of
pugnacious
excitement
in
his
pupils
falls
short
of
one
of
his
best
forms
of
usefulness
the
next
instinct
which
i
shall
mention
is
that
of
also
one
of
the
radical
endowments
of
the
race
it
often
is
the
antagonist
of
imitation
whether
social
progress
is
due
more
to
the
passion
for
keeping
old
things
and
habits
or
to
the
passion
of
imitating
and
acquiring
new
ones
may
in
some
cases
be
a
difficult
thing
to
decide
the
sense
of
ownership
begins
in
the
second
year
of
life
among
the
first
words
which
an
infant
learns
to
utter
are
the
words
and
and
woe
to
the
parents
of
twins
who
fail
to
provide
their
gifts
in
duplicate
the
depth
and
primitiveness
of
this
instinct
would
seem
to
cast
a
sort
of
psychological
discredit
in
advance
upon
all
radical
forms
of
communistic
utopia
private
proprietorship
can
not
be
practically
abolished
until
human
nature
is
changed
it
seems
essential
to
mental
health
that
the
individual
should
have
something
beyond
the
bare
clothes
on
his
back
to
which
he
can
assert
exclusive
possession
and
which
he
may
defend
adversely
against
the
world
even
those
religious
orders
who
make
the
most
stringent
vows
of
poverty
have
found
it
necessary
to
relax
the
rule
a
little
in
favor
of
the
human
heart
made
unhappy
by
reduction
to
too
disinterested
terms
the
monk
must
have
his
books
the
nun
must
have
her
little
garden
and
the
images
and
pictures
in
her
room
in
education
the
instinct
of
ownership
is
fundamental
and
can
be
appealed
to
in
many
ways
in
the
house
training
in
order
and
neatness
begins
with
the
arrangement
of
the
child
own
personal
possessions
in
the
school
ownership
is
particularly
important
in
connection
with
one
of
its
special
forms
of
activity
the
collecting
impulse
an
object
possibly
not
very
interesting
in
itself
like
a
shell
a
postage
stamp
or
a
single
map
or
drawing
will
acquire
an
interest
if
it
fills
a
gap
in
a
collection
or
helps
to
complete
a
series
much
of
the
scholarly
work
of
the
world
so
far
as
it
is
mere
bibliography
memory
and
erudition
and
this
lies
at
the
basis
of
all
our
human
scholarship
would
seem
to
owe
its
interest
rather
to
the
way
in
which
it
gratifies
the
accumulating
and
collecting
instinct
than
to
any
special
appeal
which
it
makes
to
our
cravings
after
rationality
a
man
wishes
a
complete
collection
of
information
wishes
to
know
more
about
a
subject
than
anybody
else
much
as
another
may
wish
to
own
more
dollars
or
more
early
editions
or
more
engravings
before
the
letter
than
anybody
else
the
teacher
who
can
work
this
impulse
into
the
school
tasks
is
fortunate
almost
all
children
collect
something
a
tactful
teacher
may
get
them
to
take
pleasure
in
collecting
books
in
keeping
a
neat
and
orderly
collection
of
notes
in
starting
when
they
are
mature
enough
a
card
catalogue
in
preserving
every
drawing
or
map
which
they
may
make
neatness
order
and
method
are
thus
instinctively
gained
along
with
the
other
benefits
which
the
possession
of
the
collection
entails
even
such
a
noisome
thing
as
a
collection
of
postage
stamps
may
be
used
by
the
teacher
as
an
inciter
of
interest
in
the
geographical
and
historical
information
which
she
desires
to
impart
sloyd
successfully
avails
itself
of
this
instinct
in
causing
the
pupil
to
make
a
collection
of
wooden
implements
fit
for
his
own
private
use
at
home
collecting
is
of
course
the
basis
of
all
natural
history
study
and
probably
nobody
ever
became
a
good
naturalist
who
was
not
an
unusually
active
collector
when
a
boy
is
another
great
instinctive
tendency
with
which
the
schoolroom
has
to
contract
an
alliance
up
to
the
eighth
or
ninth
year
of
childhood
one
may
say
that
the
child
does
hardly
anything
else
than
handle
objects
explore
things
with
his
hands
doing
and
undoing
setting
up
and
knocking
down
putting
together
and
pulling
apart
for
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
construction
and
destruction
are
two
names
for
the
same
manual
activity
both
signify
the
production
of
change
and
the
working
of
effects
in
outward
things
the
result
of
all
this
is
that
intimate
familiarity
with
the
physical
environment
that
acquaintance
with
the
properties
of
material
things
which
is
really
the
foundation
of
human
to
the
very
last
in
most
of
us
the
conceptions
of
objects
and
their
properties
are
limited
to
the
notion
of
what
we
can
with
a
means
something
we
can
lean
upon
or
strike
with
something
to
cook
or
warm
ourselves
or
burn
things
up
withal
something
with
which
to
tie
things
together
for
most
people
these
objects
have
no
other
meaning
in
geometry
the
cylinder
circle
sphere
are
defined
as
what
you
get
by
going
through
certain
processes
of
construction
revolving
a
parallelogram
upon
one
of
its
sides
etc
the
more
different
kinds
of
things
a
child
thus
gets
to
know
by
treating
and
handling
them
the
more
confident
grows
his
sense
of
kinship
with
the
world
in
which
he
lives
an
unsympathetic
adult
will
wonder
at
the
fascinated
hours
which
a
child
will
spend
in
putting
his
blocks
together
and
rearranging
them
but
the
wise
education
takes
the
tide
at
the
flood
and
from
the
kindergarten
upward
devotes
the
first
years
of
education
to
training
in
construction
and
to
i
need
not
recapitulate
here
what
i
said
awhile
back
about
the
superiority
of
the
objective
and
experimental
methods
they
occupy
the
pupil
in
a
way
most
congruous
with
the
spontaneous
interests
of
his
age
they
absorb
him
and
leave
impressions
durable
and
profound
compared
with
the
youth
taught
by
these
methods
one
brought
up
exclusively
by
books
carries
through
life
a
certain
remoteness
from
reality
he
stands
as
it
were
out
of
the
pale
and
feels
that
he
stands
so
and
often
suffers
a
kind
of
melancholy
from
which
he
might
have
been
rescued
by
a
more
real
education
there
are
other
impulses
such
as
love
of
approbation
or
vanity
shyness
and
secretiveness
of
which
a
word
might
be
said
but
they
are
too
familiar
to
need
it
you
can
easily
pursue
the
subject
by
your
own
reflection
there
is
one
general
law
however
that
relates
to
many
of
our
instinctive
tendencies
and
that
has
no
little
importance
in
education
and
i
must
refer
to
it
briefly
before
i
leave
the
subject
it
has
been
called
the
law
of
transitoriness
in
instincts
many
of
our
impulsive
tendencies
ripen
at
a
certain
period
and
if
the
appropriate
objects
be
then
and
there
provided
habits
of
conduct
toward
them
are
acquired
which
last
but
if
the
objects
be
not
forthcoming
then
the
impulse
may
die
out
before
a
habit
is
formed
and
later
it
may
be
hard
to
teach
the
creature
to
react
appropriately
in
those
directions
the
sucking
instincts
in
mammals
the
following
instinct
in
certain
birds
and
quadrupeds
are
examples
of
this
they
fade
away
shortly
after
birth
in
children
we
observe
a
ripening
of
impulses
and
interests
in
a
certain
determinate
order
creeping
walking
climbing
imitating
vocal
sounds
constructing
drawing
calculating
possess
the
child
in
succession
and
in
some
children
the
possession
while
it
lasts
may
be
of
a
and
exclusive
sort
later
the
interest
in
any
one
of
these
things
may
wholly
fade
away
of
course
the
proper
pedagogic
moment
to
work
skill
in
and
to
clench
the
useful
habit
is
when
the
native
impulse
is
most
acutely
present
crowd
on
the
athletic
opportunities
the
mental
arithmetic
the
the
drawing
the
botany
or
what
not
the
moment
you
have
reason
to
think
the
hour
is
ripe
the
hour
may
not
last
long
and
while
it
continues
you
may
safely
let
all
the
child
other
occupations
take
a
second
place
in
this
way
you
economize
time
and
deepen
skill
for
many
an
infant
prodigy
artistic
or
mathematical
has
a
flowering
epoch
of
but
a
few
months
one
can
draw
no
specific
rules
for
all
this
it
depends
on
close
observation
in
the
particular
case
and
parents
here
have
a
great
advantage
over
teachers
in
fact
the
law
of
transitoriness
has
little
chance
of
individualized
application
in
the
schools
such
is
the
little
interested
and
impulsive
psychophysical
organism
whose
springs
of
action
the
teacher
must
divine
and
to
whose
ways
he
must
become
accustomed
he
must
start
with
the
native
tendencies
and
enlarge
the
pupil
entire
passive
and
active
experience
he
must
ply
him
with
new
objects
and
stimuli
and
make
him
taste
the
fruits
of
his
behavior
so
that
now
that
whole
context
of
remembered
experience
is
what
shall
determine
his
conduct
when
he
gets
the
stimulus
and
not
the
bare
immediate
impression
as
the
pupil
life
thus
enlarges
it
gets
fuller
and
fuller
of
all
sorts
of
memories
and
associations
and
substitutions
but
the
eye
accustomed
to
psychological
analysis
will
discern
underneath
it
all
the
outlines
of
our
simple
psychophysical
scheme
respect
then
i
beg
you
always
the
original
reactions
even
when
you
are
seeking
to
overcome
their
connection
with
certain
objects
and
to
supplant
them
with
others
that
you
wish
to
make
the
rule
bad
behavior
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
teacher
art
is
as
good
a
as
good
behavior
in
fact
paradoxical
as
it
may
sound
to
say
so
it
is
often
a
better
than
good
behavior
would
be
the
acquired
reactions
must
be
made
habitual
whenever
they
are
appropriate
therefore
habit
is
the
next
subject
to
which
your
attention
is
invited
viii
the
laws
of
habit
it
is
very
important
that
teachers
should
realize
the
importance
of
habit
and
psychology
helps
us
greatly
at
this
point
we
speak
it
is
true
of
good
habits
and
of
bad
habits
but
when
people
use
the
word
in
the
majority
of
instances
it
is
a
bad
habit
which
they
have
in
mind
they
talk
of
the
and
the
and
the
but
not
of
the
or
the
or
the
but
the
fact
is
that
our
virtues
are
habits
as
much
as
our
vices
all
our
life
so
far
as
it
has
definite
form
is
but
a
mass
of
habits
practical
emotional
and
intellectual
systematically
organized
for
our
weal
or
woe
and
bearing
us
irresistibly
toward
our
destiny
whatever
the
latter
may
be
since
pupils
can
understand
this
at
a
comparatively
early
age
and
since
to
understand
it
contributes
in
no
small
measure
to
their
feeling
of
responsibility
it
would
be
well
if
the
teacher
were
able
himself
to
talk
to
them
of
the
philosophy
of
habit
in
some
such
abstract
terms
as
i
am
now
about
to
talk
of
it
to
you
i
believe
that
we
are
subject
to
the
law
of
habit
in
consequence
of
the
fact
that
we
have
bodies
the
plasticity
of
the
living
matter
of
our
nervous
system
in
short
is
the
reason
why
we
do
a
thing
with
difficulty
the
first
time
but
soon
do
it
more
and
more
easily
and
finally
with
sufficient
practice
do
it
or
with
hardly
any
consciousness
at
all
our
nervous
systems
have
in
carpenter
words
to
the
way
in
which
they
have
been
exercised
just
as
a
sheet
of
paper
or
a
coat
once
creased
or
folded
tends
to
fall
forever
afterward
into
the
same
identical
folds
habit
is
thus
a
second
nature
or
rather
as
the
duke
of
wellington
said
it
is
times
nature
at
any
rate
as
regards
its
importance
in
adult
life
for
the
acquired
habits
of
our
training
have
by
that
time
inhibited
or
strangled
most
of
the
natural
impulsive
tendencies
which
were
originally
there
hundredths
or
possibly
nine
hundred
and
thousandths
of
our
activity
is
purely
automatic
and
habitual
from
our
rising
in
the
morning
to
our
lying
down
each
night
our
dressing
and
undressing
our
eating
and
drinking
our
greetings
and
partings
our
and
giving
way
for
ladies
to
precede
nay
even
most
of
the
forms
of
our
common
speech
are
things
of
a
type
so
fixed
by
repetition
as
almost
to
be
classed
as
reflex
actions
to
each
sort
of
impression
we
have
an
automatic
response
my
very
words
to
you
now
are
an
example
of
what
i
mean
for
having
already
lectured
upon
habit
and
printed
a
chapter
about
it
in
a
book
and
read
the
latter
when
in
print
i
find
my
tongue
inevitably
falling
into
its
old
phrases
and
repeating
almost
literally
what
i
said
before
so
far
as
we
are
thus
mere
bundles
of
habit
we
are
stereotyped
creatures
imitators
and
copiers
of
our
past
selves
and
since
this
under
any
circumstances
is
what
we
always
tend
to
become
it
follows
first
of
all
that
the
teacher
prime
concern
should
be
to
ingrain
into
the
pupil
that
assortment
of
habits
that
shall
be
most
useful
to
him
throughout
life
education
is
for
behavior
and
habits
are
the
stuff
of
which
behavior
consists
to
quote
my
earlier
book
directly
the
great
thing
in
all
education
is
to
our
nervous
system
our
ally
instead
of
our
it
is
to
fund
and
capitalize
our
acquisitions
and
live
at
ease
upon
the
interest
of
the
fund
this
we
must
make
automatic
and
habitual
as
early
as
possible
as
many
useful
actions
as
we
and
as
carefully
guard
against
the
growing
into
ways
that
are
likely
to
be
disadvantageous
the
more
of
the
details
of
our
daily
life
we
can
hand
over
to
the
effortless
custody
of
automatism
the
more
our
higher
powers
of
mind
will
be
set
free
for
their
own
proper
work
there
is
no
more
miserable
human
being
than
one
in
whom
nothing
is
habitual
but
indecision
and
for
whom
the
lighting
of
every
cigar
the
drinking
of
every
cup
the
time
of
rising
and
going
to
bed
every
day
and
the
beginning
of
every
bit
of
work
are
subjects
of
express
volitional
deliberation
full
half
the
time
of
such
a
man
goes
to
the
deciding
or
regretting
of
matters
which
ought
to
be
so
ingrained
in
him
as
practically
not
to
exist
for
his
consciousness
at
all
if
there
be
such
daily
duties
not
yet
ingrained
in
any
one
of
my
hearers
let
him
begin
this
very
hour
to
set
the
matter
right
in
professor
bain
chapter
on
moral
habits
there
are
some
admirable
practical
remarks
laid
down
two
great
maxims
emerge
from
the
treatment
the
first
is
that
in
the
acquisition
of
a
new
habit
or
the
leaving
off
of
an
old
one
we
must
take
care
to
ourselves
with
as
strong
and
decided
an
initiative
as
accumulate
all
the
possible
circumstances
which
shall
reinforce
the
right
motives
put
yourself
assiduously
in
conditions
that
encourage
the
new
way
make
engagements
incompatible
with
the
old
take
a
public
pledge
if
the
case
allows
in
short
envelope
your
resolution
with
every
aid
you
know
this
will
give
your
new
beginning
such
a
momentum
that
the
temptation
to
break
down
will
not
occur
as
soon
as
it
otherwise
might
and
every
day
during
which
a
breakdown
is
postponed
adds
to
the
chances
of
its
not
occurring
at
all
i
remember
long
ago
reading
in
an
austrian
paper
the
advertisement
of
a
certain
rudolph
somebody
who
promised
fifty
gulden
reward
to
any
one
who
after
that
date
should
find
him
at
the
of
ambrosius
i
do
the
advertisement
continued
consequence
of
a
promise
which
i
have
made
my
wife
with
such
a
wife
and
such
an
understanding
of
the
way
in
which
to
start
new
habits
it
would
be
safe
to
stake
one
money
on
rudolph
ultimate
success
the
second
maxim
is
suffer
an
exception
to
occur
till
the
new
habit
is
securely
rooted
in
your
each
lapse
is
like
the
letting
fall
of
a
ball
of
string
which
one
is
carefully
winding
up
a
single
slip
undoes
more
than
a
great
many
turns
will
wind
again
continuity
of
training
is
the
great
means
of
making
the
nervous
system
act
infallibly
right
as
professor
bain
says
the
peculiarity
of
the
moral
habits
contradistinguishing
them
from
the
intellectual
acquisitions
is
the
presence
of
two
hostile
powers
one
to
be
gradually
raised
into
the
ascendant
over
the
other
it
is
necessary
above
all
things
in
such
a
situation
never
to
lose
a
battle
every
gain
on
the
wrong
side
undoes
the
effect
of
many
conquests
on
the
right
the
essential
precaution
therefore
is
so
to
regulate
the
two
opposing
powers
that
the
one
may
have
a
series
of
uninterrupted
successes
until
repetition
has
fortified
it
to
such
a
degree
as
to
enable
it
to
cope
with
the
opposition
under
any
circumstances
this
is
the
theoretically
best
career
of
mental
progress
a
third
maxim
may
be
added
to
the
preceding
pair
the
very
first
possible
opportunity
to
act
on
every
resolution
you
make
and
on
every
emotional
prompting
you
may
experience
in
the
direction
of
the
habits
you
aspire
to
it
is
not
in
the
moment
of
their
forming
but
in
the
moment
of
their
producing
motor
effects
that
resolves
and
aspirations
communicate
the
new
to
the
brain
no
matter
how
full
a
reservoir
of
maxims
one
may
possess
and
no
matter
how
good
one
sentiments
may
be
if
one
have
not
taken
advantage
of
every
concrete
opportunity
to
act
one
character
may
remain
entirely
unaffected
for
the
better
with
good
intentions
hell
proverbially
is
paved
this
is
an
obvious
consequence
of
the
principles
i
have
laid
down
a
as
mill
says
a
completely
fashioned
will
and
a
will
in
the
sense
in
which
he
means
it
is
an
aggregate
of
tendencies
to
act
in
a
firm
and
prompt
and
definite
way
upon
all
the
principal
emergencies
of
life
a
tendency
to
act
only
becomes
effectively
ingrained
in
us
in
proportion
to
the
uninterrupted
frequency
with
which
the
actions
actually
occur
and
the
brain
to
their
use
when
a
resolve
or
a
fine
glow
of
feeling
is
allowed
to
evaporate
without
bearing
practical
fruit
it
is
worse
than
a
chance
lost
it
works
so
as
positively
to
hinder
future
resolutions
and
emotions
from
taking
the
normal
path
of
discharge
there
is
no
more
contemptible
type
of
human
character
than
that
of
the
nerveless
sentimentalist
and
dreamer
who
spends
his
life
in
a
weltering
sea
of
sensibility
but
never
does
a
concrete
manly
deed
this
leads
to
a
fourth
maxim
preach
too
much
to
your
pupils
or
abound
in
good
talk
in
the
lie
in
wait
rather
for
the
practical
opportunities
be
prompt
to
seize
those
as
they
pass
and
thus
at
one
operation
get
your
pupils
both
to
think
to
feel
and
to
do
the
strokes
of
are
what
give
the
new
set
to
the
character
and
work
the
good
habits
into
its
organic
tissue
preaching
and
talking
too
soon
become
an
ineffectual
bore
there
is
a
passage
in
darwin
short
autobiography
which
has
been
often
quoted
and
which
for
the
sake
of
its
bearing
on
our
subject
of
habit
i
must
now
quote
again
darwin
says
up
to
the
age
of
thirty
or
beyond
it
poetry
of
many
kinds
gave
me
great
pleasure
and
even
as
a
schoolboy
i
took
intense
delight
in
shakespeare
especially
in
the
historical
plays
i
have
also
said
that
pictures
formerly
gave
me
considerable
and
music
very
great
delight
but
now
for
many
years
i
can
not
endure
to
read
a
line
of
poetry
i
have
tried
lately
to
read
shakespeare
and
found
it
so
intolerably
dull
that
it
nauseated
me
i
have
also
almost
lost
my
taste
for
pictures
or
music
my
mind
seems
to
have
become
a
kind
of
machine
for
grinding
general
laws
out
of
large
collections
of
facts
but
why
this
should
have
caused
the
atrophy
of
that
part
of
the
brain
alone
on
which
the
higher
tastes
depend
i
can
not
conceive
if
i
had
to
live
my
life
again
i
would
have
made
a
rule
to
read
some
poetry
and
listen
to
some
music
at
least
once
every
week
for
perhaps
the
parts
of
my
brain
now
atrophied
would
thus
have
been
kept
alive
through
use
the
loss
of
these
tastes
is
a
loss
of
happiness
and
may
possibly
be
injurious
to
the
intellect
and
more
probably
to
the
moral
character
by
enfeebling
the
emotional
part
of
our
nature
we
all
intend
when
young
to
be
all
that
may
become
a
man
before
the
destroyer
cuts
us
down
we
wish
and
expect
to
enjoy
poetry
always
to
grow
more
and
more
intelligent
about
pictures
and
music
to
keep
in
touch
with
spiritual
and
religious
ideas
and
even
not
to
let
the
greater
philosophic
thoughts
of
our
time
develop
quite
beyond
our
view
we
mean
all
this
in
youth
i
say
and
yet
in
how
many
men
and
women
is
such
an
honest
and
sanguine
expectation
fulfilled
surely
in
comparatively
few
and
the
laws
of
habit
show
us
why
some
interest
in
each
of
these
things
arises
in
everybody
at
the
proper
age
but
if
not
persistently
fed
with
the
appropriate
matter
instead
of
growing
into
a
powerful
and
necessary
habit
it
atrophies
and
dies
choked
by
the
rival
interests
to
which
the
daily
food
is
given
we
make
ourselves
into
darwins
in
this
negative
respect
by
persistently
ignoring
the
essential
practical
conditions
of
our
case
we
say
abstractly
i
mean
to
enjoy
poetry
and
to
absorb
a
lot
of
it
of
course
i
fully
intend
to
keep
up
my
love
of
music
to
read
the
books
that
shall
give
new
turns
to
the
thought
of
my
time
to
keep
my
higher
spiritual
side
alive
etc
but
we
do
not
attack
these
things
concretely
and
we
do
not
begin
forget
that
every
good
that
is
worth
possessing
must
be
paid
for
in
strokes
of
daily
effort
we
postpone
and
postpone
until
those
smiling
possibilities
are
dead
whereas
ten
minutes
a
day
of
poetry
of
spiritual
reading
or
meditation
and
an
hour
or
two
a
week
at
music
pictures
or
philosophy
provided
we
began
and
suffered
no
remission
would
infallibly
give
us
in
due
time
the
fulness
of
all
we
desire
by
neglecting
the
necessary
concrete
labor
by
sparing
ourselves
the
little
daily
tax
we
are
positively
digging
the
graves
of
our
higher
possibilities
this
is
a
point
concerning
which
you
teachers
might
well
give
a
little
timely
information
to
your
older
and
more
aspiring
pupils
according
as
a
function
receives
daily
exercise
or
not
the
man
becomes
a
different
kind
of
being
in
later
life
we
have
lately
had
a
number
of
accomplished
hindoo
visitors
at
cambridge
who
talked
freely
of
life
and
philosophy
more
than
one
of
them
has
confided
to
me
that
the
sight
of
our
faces
all
contracted
as
they
are
with
the
habitual
american
and
anxiety
of
expression
and
our
ungraceful
and
distorted
attitudes
when
sitting
made
on
him
a
very
painful
impression
i
do
not
see
said
one
how
it
is
possible
for
you
to
live
as
you
do
without
a
single
minute
in
your
day
deliberately
given
to
tranquillity
and
meditation
it
is
an
invariable
part
of
our
hindoo
life
to
retire
for
at
least
half
an
hour
daily
into
silence
to
relax
our
muscles
govern
our
breathing
and
meditate
on
eternal
things
every
hindoo
child
is
trained
to
this
from
a
very
early
age
the
good
fruits
of
such
a
discipline
were
obvious
in
the
physical
repose
and
lack
of
tension
and
the
wonderful
smoothness
and
calmness
of
facial
expression
and
imperturbability
of
manner
of
these
orientals
i
felt
that
my
countrymen
were
depriving
themselves
of
an
essential
grace
of
character
how
many
american
children
ever
hear
it
said
by
parent
or
teacher
that
they
should
moderate
their
piercing
voices
that
they
should
relax
their
unused
muscles
and
as
far
as
possible
when
sitting
sit
quite
still
not
one
in
a
thousand
not
one
in
five
thousand
yet
from
its
reflex
influence
on
the
inner
mental
states
this
ceaseless
and
are
working
on
us
grievous
national
harm
i
beg
you
teachers
to
think
a
little
seriously
of
this
matter
perhaps
you
can
help
our
rising
generation
of
americans
toward
the
beginning
of
a
better
set
of
personal
ideals
b
b
see
the
address
on
the
gospel
of
relaxation
later
in
this
volume
to
go
back
now
to
our
general
maxims
i
may
at
last
as
a
fifth
and
final
practical
maxim
about
habits
offer
something
like
this
the
faculty
of
effort
alive
in
you
by
a
little
gratuitous
exercise
every
that
is
be
systematically
heroic
in
little
unnecessary
points
do
every
day
or
two
something
for
no
other
reason
than
its
difficulty
so
that
when
the
hour
of
dire
need
draws
nigh
it
may
find
you
not
unnerved
and
untrained
to
stand
the
test
asceticism
of
this
sort
is
like
the
insurance
which
a
man
pays
on
his
house
and
goods
the
tax
does
him
no
good
at
the
time
and
possibly
may
never
bring
him
a
return
but
if
the
fire
come
his
having
paid
it
will
be
his
salvation
from
ruin
so
with
the
man
who
has
daily
inured
himself
to
habits
of
concentrated
attention
energetic
volition
and
in
unnecessary
things
he
will
stand
like
a
tower
when
everything
rocks
around
him
and
his
softer
are
winnowed
like
chaff
in
the
blast
i
have
been
accused
when
talking
of
the
subject
of
habit
of
making
old
habits
appear
so
strong
that
the
acquiring
of
new
ones
and
particularly
anything
like
a
sudden
reform
or
conversion
would
be
made
impossible
by
my
doctrine
of
course
this
would
suffice
to
condemn
the
latter
for
sudden
conversions
however
infrequent
they
may
be
unquestionably
do
occur
but
there
is
no
incompatibility
between
the
general
laws
i
have
laid
down
and
the
most
startling
sudden
alterations
in
the
way
of
character
new
habits
be
launched
i
have
expressly
said
on
condition
of
there
being
new
stimuli
and
new
excitements
now
life
abounds
in
these
and
sometimes
they
are
such
critical
and
revolutionary
experiences
that
they
change
a
man
whole
scale
of
values
and
system
of
ideas
in
such
cases
the
old
order
of
his
habits
will
be
ruptured
and
if
the
new
motives
are
lasting
new
habits
will
be
formed
and
build
up
in
him
a
new
or
regenerate
all
this
kind
of
fact
i
fully
allow
but
the
general
laws
of
habit
are
no
wise
altered
thereby
and
the
physiological
study
of
mental
conditions
still
remains
on
the
whole
the
most
powerful
ally
of
hortatory
ethics
the
hell
to
be
endured
hereafter
of
which
theology
tells
is
no
worse
than
the
hell
we
make
for
ourselves
in
this
world
by
habitually
fashioning
our
characters
in
the
wrong
way
could
the
young
but
realize
how
soon
they
will
become
mere
walking
bundles
of
habits
they
would
give
more
heed
to
their
conduct
while
in
the
plastic
state
we
are
spinning
our
own
fates
good
or
evil
and
never
to
be
undone
every
smallest
stroke
of
virtue
or
of
vice
leaves
its
scar
the
drunken
rip
van
winkle
in
jefferson
play
excuses
himself
for
every
fresh
dereliction
by
saying
i
wo
count
this
time
well
he
may
not
count
it
and
a
kind
heaven
may
not
count
it
but
it
is
being
counted
none
the
less
down
among
his
and
fibres
the
molecules
are
counting
it
registering
and
storing
it
up
to
be
used
against
him
when
the
next
temptation
comes
nothing
we
ever
do
is
in
strict
scientific
literalness
wiped
out
of
course
this
has
its
good
side
as
well
as
its
bad
one
as
we
become
permanent
drunkards
by
so
many
separate
drinks
so
we
become
saints
in
the
moral
and
authorities
and
experts
in
the
practical
and
scientific
spheres
by
so
many
separate
acts
and
hours
of
work
let
no
youth
have
any
anxiety
about
the
upshot
of
his
education
whatever
the
line
of
it
may
be
if
he
keep
faithfully
busy
each
hour
of
the
working
day
he
may
safely
leave
the
final
result
to
itself
he
can
with
perfect
certainty
count
on
waking
up
some
fine
morning
to
find
himself
one
of
the
competent
ones
of
his
generation
in
whatever
pursuit
he
may
have
singled
out
silently
between
all
the
details
of
his
business
the
of
in
all
that
class
of
matter
will
have
built
itself
up
within
him
as
a
possession
that
will
never
pass
away
young
people
should
know
this
truth
in
advance
the
ignorance
of
it
has
probably
engendered
more
discouragement
and
in
youths
embarking
on
arduous
careers
than
all
other
causes
put
together
ix
the
association
of
ideas
in
my
last
talk
in
treating
of
habit
i
chiefly
had
in
mind
our
habits
habits
of
external
conduct
but
our
thinking
and
feeling
processes
are
also
largely
subject
to
the
law
of
habit
and
one
result
of
this
is
a
phenomenon
which
you
all
know
under
the
name
of
association
of
ideas
to
that
phenomenon
i
ask
you
now
to
turn
you
remember
that
consciousness
is
an
stream
of
objects
feelings
and
impulsive
tendencies
we
saw
already
that
its
phases
or
pulses
are
like
so
many
fields
or
waves
each
field
or
wave
having
usually
its
central
point
of
liveliest
attention
in
the
shape
of
the
most
prominent
object
in
our
thought
while
all
around
this
lies
a
margin
of
other
objects
more
dimly
realized
together
with
the
margin
of
emotional
and
active
tendencies
which
the
whole
entails
describing
the
mind
thus
in
fluid
terms
we
cling
as
close
as
possible
to
nature
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
as
if
in
the
fluidity
of
these
successive
waves
everything
is
indeterminate
but
inspection
shows
that
each
wave
has
a
constitution
which
can
be
to
some
degree
explained
by
the
constitution
of
the
waves
just
passed
away
and
this
relation
of
the
wave
to
its
predecessors
is
expressed
by
the
two
fundamental
of
association
of
which
the
first
is
named
the
law
of
contiguity
the
second
that
of
similarity
the
of
tells
us
that
objects
thought
of
in
the
coming
wave
are
such
as
in
some
previous
experience
were
to
the
objects
represented
in
the
wave
that
is
passing
away
the
vanishing
objects
were
once
formerly
their
neighbors
in
the
mind
when
you
recite
the
alphabet
or
your
prayers
or
when
the
sight
of
an
object
reminds
you
of
its
name
or
the
name
reminds
you
of
the
object
it
is
through
the
law
of
contiguity
that
the
terms
are
suggested
to
the
mind
the
of
says
that
when
contiguity
fails
to
describe
what
happens
the
coming
objects
will
prove
to
the
going
objects
even
though
the
two
were
never
experienced
together
before
in
our
of
fancy
this
is
frequently
the
case
if
arresting
ourselves
in
the
flow
of
reverie
we
ask
the
question
how
came
we
to
be
thinking
of
just
this
object
now
we
can
almost
always
trace
its
presence
to
some
previous
object
which
has
introduced
it
to
the
mind
according
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
laws
the
entire
routine
of
our
memorized
acquisitions
for
example
is
a
consequence
of
nothing
but
the
law
of
contiguity
the
words
of
a
poem
the
formulas
of
trigonometry
the
facts
of
history
the
properties
of
material
things
are
all
known
to
us
as
definite
systems
or
groups
of
objects
which
cohere
in
an
order
fixed
by
innumerable
iterations
and
of
which
any
one
part
reminds
us
of
the
others
in
dry
and
prosaic
minds
almost
all
the
mental
sequences
flow
along
these
lines
of
habitual
routine
repetition
and
suggestion
in
witty
imaginative
minds
on
the
other
hand
the
routine
is
broken
through
with
ease
at
any
moment
and
one
field
of
mental
objects
will
suggest
another
with
which
perhaps
in
the
whole
history
of
human
thinking
it
had
never
once
before
been
coupled
the
link
here
is
usually
some
between
the
objects
successively
thought
of
an
analogy
often
so
subtle
that
although
we
feel
it
we
can
with
difficulty
analyze
its
ground
as
where
for
example
we
find
something
masculine
in
the
color
red
and
something
feminine
in
the
color
pale
blue
or
where
of
three
human
beings
characters
one
will
remind
us
of
a
cat
another
of
a
dog
the
third
perhaps
of
a
cow
psychologists
have
of
course
gone
very
deeply
into
the
question
of
what
the
causes
of
association
may
be
and
some
of
them
have
tried
to
show
that
contiguity
and
similarity
are
not
two
radically
diverse
laws
but
that
either
presupposes
the
presence
of
the
other
i
myself
am
disposed
to
think
that
the
phenomena
of
association
depend
on
our
cerebral
constitution
and
are
not
immediate
consequences
of
our
being
rational
beings
in
other
words
when
we
shall
have
become
disembodied
spirits
it
may
be
that
our
trains
of
consciousness
will
follow
different
laws
these
questions
are
discussed
in
the
books
on
psychology
and
i
hope
that
some
of
you
will
be
interested
in
following
them
there
but
i
will
on
the
present
occasion
ignore
them
entirely
for
as
teachers
it
is
the
of
association
that
practically
concerns
you
let
its
grounds
be
spiritual
or
cerebral
or
what
they
may
and
let
its
laws
be
reducible
or
to
one
your
pupils
whatever
else
they
are
are
at
any
rate
little
pieces
of
associating
machinery
their
education
consists
in
the
organizing
within
them
of
determinate
tendencies
to
associate
one
thing
with
another
impressions
with
consequences
these
with
reactions
those
with
results
and
so
on
indefinitely
the
more
copious
the
associative
systems
the
completer
the
individual
adaptations
to
the
world
the
teacher
can
formulate
his
function
to
himself
therefore
in
terms
of
as
well
as
in
terms
of
and
acquired
reaction
it
is
mainly
that
of
up
useful
systems
of
in
the
pupil
mind
this
description
sounds
wider
than
the
one
i
began
by
giving
but
when
one
thinks
that
our
trains
of
association
whatever
they
may
be
normally
issue
in
acquired
reactions
or
behavior
one
sees
that
in
a
general
way
the
same
mass
of
facts
is
covered
by
both
formulas
it
is
astonishing
how
many
mental
operations
we
can
explain
when
we
have
once
grasped
the
principles
of
association
the
great
problem
which
association
undertakes
to
solve
is
does
just
this
particular
field
of
consciousness
constituted
in
this
particular
way
now
appear
before
my
mind
it
may
be
a
field
of
objects
imagined
it
may
be
of
objects
remembered
or
of
objects
perceived
it
may
include
an
action
resolved
on
in
either
case
when
the
field
is
analyzed
into
its
parts
those
parts
can
be
shown
to
have
proceeded
from
parts
of
fields
previously
before
consciousness
in
consequence
of
one
or
other
of
the
laws
of
association
just
laid
down
those
laws
the
mind
interest
shifting
hither
and
thither
deflects
it
and
attention
as
we
shall
later
see
steers
it
and
keeps
it
from
too
zigzag
a
course
to
grasp
these
factors
clearly
gives
one
a
solid
and
simple
understanding
of
the
psychological
machinery
the
the
of
an
individual
means
really
nothing
but
the
habitual
form
of
his
associations
to
break
up
bad
associations
or
wrong
ones
to
build
others
in
to
guide
the
associative
tendencies
into
the
most
fruitful
channels
is
the
educator
principal
task
but
here
as
with
all
other
simple
principles
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
application
psychology
can
state
the
laws
concrete
tact
and
talent
alone
can
work
them
to
useful
results
meanwhile
it
is
a
matter
of
the
commonest
experience
that
our
minds
may
pass
from
one
object
to
another
by
various
intermediary
fields
of
consciousness
the
indeterminateness
of
our
paths
of
association
is
thus
almost
as
striking
a
feature
of
them
as
the
uniformity
of
their
abstract
form
start
from
any
idea
whatever
and
the
entire
range
of
your
ideas
is
potentially
at
your
disposal
if
we
take
as
the
associative
or
cue
some
simple
word
which
i
pronounce
before
you
there
is
no
limit
to
the
possible
diversity
of
suggestions
which
it
may
set
up
in
your
minds
suppose
i
say
for
example
some
of
you
may
think
of
the
blue
sky
and
hot
weather
from
which
we
now
are
suffering
then
go
off
on
thoughts
of
summer
clothing
or
possibly
of
meteorology
at
large
others
may
think
of
the
spectrum
and
the
physiology
of
and
glide
into
and
recent
physical
speculations
others
may
think
of
blue
ribbons
or
of
the
blue
flowers
on
a
friend
hat
and
proceed
on
lines
of
personal
reminiscence
to
others
again
etymology
and
linguistic
thoughts
may
be
suggested
or
blue
may
be
as
a
synonym
for
melancholy
and
a
train
of
associates
connected
with
morbid
psychology
may
proceed
to
unroll
themselves
in
the
same
person
the
same
word
heard
at
different
times
will
provoke
in
consequence
of
the
varying
marginal
preoccupations
either
one
of
a
number
of
diverse
possible
associative
sequences
professor
münsterberg
performed
this
experiment
methodically
using
the
same
words
four
times
over
at
intervals
as
for
four
different
persons
who
were
the
subjects
of
observation
he
found
almost
no
constancy
in
their
associations
taken
at
these
different
times
in
short
the
entire
potential
content
of
one
consciousness
is
accessible
from
any
one
of
its
points
this
is
why
we
can
never
work
the
laws
of
association
forward
starting
from
the
present
field
as
a
cue
we
can
never
cipher
out
in
advance
just
what
the
person
will
be
thinking
of
five
minutes
later
the
elements
which
may
become
prepotent
in
the
process
the
parts
of
each
successive
field
round
which
the
associations
shall
chiefly
turn
the
possible
bifurcations
of
suggestion
are
so
numerous
and
ambiguous
as
to
be
indeterminable
before
the
fact
but
although
we
can
not
work
the
laws
of
association
forward
we
can
always
work
them
backwards
we
can
not
say
now
what
we
shall
find
ourselves
thinking
of
five
minutes
hence
but
whatever
it
may
be
we
shall
then
be
able
to
trace
it
through
intermediary
links
of
contiguity
or
similarity
to
what
we
are
thinking
now
what
so
baffles
our
prevision
is
the
shifting
part
played
by
the
margin
and
focus
in
fact
by
each
element
by
itself
of
the
margin
or
focus
in
calling
up
the
next
ideas
for
example
i
am
reciting
hall
in
order
to
divert
my
mind
from
a
state
of
suspense
that
i
am
in
concerning
the
will
of
a
relative
that
is
dead
the
will
still
remains
in
the
mental
background
as
an
extremely
marginal
or
portion
of
my
field
of
consciousness
but
the
poem
fairly
keeps
my
attention
from
it
until
i
come
to
the
line
i
the
heir
of
all
the
ages
in
the
foremost
files
of
time
the
words
the
heir
immediately
make
an
electric
connection
with
the
marginal
thought
of
the
will
that
in
turn
makes
my
heart
beat
with
anticipation
of
my
possible
legacy
so
that
i
throw
down
the
book
and
pace
the
floor
excitedly
with
visions
of
my
future
fortune
pouring
through
my
mind
any
portion
of
the
field
of
consciousness
that
has
more
potentialities
of
emotional
excitement
than
another
may
thus
be
roused
to
predominant
activity
and
the
shifting
play
of
interest
now
in
one
portion
now
in
another
deflects
the
currents
in
all
sorts
of
zigzag
ways
the
mental
activity
running
hither
and
thither
as
the
sparks
run
in
paper
one
more
point
and
i
shall
have
said
as
much
to
you
as
seems
necessary
about
the
process
of
association
you
just
saw
how
a
single
exciting
word
may
call
up
its
own
associates
prepotently
and
deflect
our
whole
train
of
thinking
from
the
previous
track
the
fact
is
that
every
portion
of
the
field
to
call
up
its
own
associates
but
if
these
associates
be
severally
different
there
is
rivalry
and
as
soon
as
one
or
a
few
begin
to
be
effective
the
others
seem
to
get
siphoned
out
as
it
were
and
left
behind
seldom
however
as
in
our
example
does
the
process
seem
to
turn
round
a
single
item
in
the
mental
field
or
even
round
the
entire
field
that
is
immediately
in
the
act
of
passing
it
is
a
matter
of
into
which
portions
of
fields
that
are
already
past
especially
seem
to
enter
and
have
their
say
thus
to
go
back
to
hall
each
word
as
i
recite
it
in
its
due
order
is
suggested
not
solely
by
the
previous
word
now
expiring
on
my
lips
but
it
is
rather
the
effect
of
all
the
previous
words
taken
together
of
the
verse
ages
for
example
calls
up
in
the
foremost
files
of
time
when
preceded
by
i
the
heir
of
all
the
but
when
preceded
by
for
i
doubt
not
through
the
it
calls
up
one
increasing
purpose
runs
similarly
if
i
write
on
the
blackboard
the
letters
a
b
c
d
e
f
they
probably
suggest
to
you
g
h
i
but
if
i
write
a
b
a
d
d
e
f
if
they
suggest
anything
they
suggest
as
their
complement
e
c
t
or
e
f
i
c
i
e
n
c
y
the
result
depending
on
the
total
constellation
even
though
most
of
the
single
items
be
the
same
my
practical
reason
for
mentioning
this
law
is
this
that
it
follows
from
it
that
in
working
associations
into
your
pupils
minds
you
must
not
rely
on
single
cues
but
multiply
the
cues
as
much
as
possible
couple
the
desired
reaction
with
numerous
constellations
of
antecedents
do
always
ask
the
question
for
example
in
the
same
way
do
use
the
same
kind
of
data
in
numerical
problems
vary
your
illustrations
as
much
as
you
can
when
we
come
to
the
subject
of
memory
we
shall
learn
still
more
about
this
so
much
then
for
the
general
subject
of
association
in
leaving
it
for
other
topics
in
which
however
we
shall
abundantly
find
it
involved
again
i
can
not
too
strongly
urge
you
to
acquire
a
habit
of
thinking
of
your
pupils
in
associative
terms
all
governors
of
mankind
from
doctors
and
to
demagogues
and
statesmen
instinctively
come
so
to
conceive
their
charges
if
you
do
the
same
thinking
of
them
however
else
you
may
think
of
them
besides
as
so
many
little
systems
of
associating
machinery
you
will
be
astonished
at
the
intimacy
of
insight
into
their
operations
and
at
the
practicality
of
the
results
which
you
will
gain
we
think
of
our
acquaintances
for
example
as
characterized
by
certain
these
tendencies
will
in
almost
every
instance
prove
to
be
tendencies
to
association
certain
ideas
in
them
are
always
followed
by
certain
other
ideas
these
by
certain
feelings
and
impulses
to
approve
or
disapprove
assent
or
decline
if
the
topic
arouse
one
of
those
first
ideas
the
practical
outcome
can
be
pretty
well
foreseen
of
character
in
short
are
largely
types
of
association
x
interest
at
our
last
meeting
i
treated
of
the
native
tendencies
of
the
pupil
to
react
in
characteristically
definite
ways
upon
different
stimuli
or
exciting
circumstances
in
fact
i
treated
of
the
pupil
instincts
now
some
situations
appeal
to
special
instincts
from
the
very
outset
and
others
fail
to
do
so
until
the
proper
connections
have
been
organized
in
the
course
of
the
person
training
we
say
of
the
former
set
of
objects
or
situations
that
they
are
in
themselves
and
originally
of
the
latter
we
say
that
they
are
natively
uninteresting
and
that
interest
in
them
has
first
to
be
acquired
no
topic
has
received
more
attention
from
pedagogical
writers
than
that
of
interest
it
is
the
natural
sequel
to
the
instincts
we
so
lately
discussed
and
it
is
therefore
well
fitted
to
be
the
next
subject
which
we
take
up
since
some
objects
are
natively
interesting
and
in
others
interest
is
artificially
acquired
the
teacher
must
know
which
the
natively
interesting
ones
are
for
as
we
shall
see
immediately
other
objects
can
artificially
acquire
an
interest
only
through
first
becoming
associated
with
some
of
these
natively
interesting
things
the
native
interests
of
children
lie
altogether
in
the
sphere
of
sensation
novel
things
to
look
at
or
novel
sounds
to
hear
especially
when
they
involve
the
spectacle
of
action
of
a
violent
sort
will
always
divert
the
attention
from
abstract
conceptions
of
objects
verbally
taken
in
the
grimace
that
johnny
is
making
the
spitballs
that
tommy
is
ready
to
throw
the
in
the
street
or
the
distant
firebells
ringing
these
are
the
rivals
with
which
the
teacher
powers
of
being
interesting
have
incessantly
to
cope
the
child
will
always
attend
more
to
what
a
teacher
does
than
to
what
the
same
teacher
says
during
the
performance
of
experiments
or
while
the
teacher
is
drawing
on
the
blackboard
the
children
are
tranquil
and
absorbed
i
have
seen
a
roomful
of
college
students
suddenly
become
perfectly
still
to
look
at
their
professor
of
physics
tie
a
piece
of
string
around
a
stick
which
he
was
going
to
use
in
an
experiment
but
immediately
grow
restless
when
he
began
to
explain
the
experiment
a
lady
told
me
that
one
day
during
a
lesson
she
was
delighted
at
having
captured
so
completely
the
attention
of
one
of
her
young
charges
he
did
not
remove
his
eyes
from
her
face
but
he
said
to
her
after
the
lesson
was
over
i
looked
at
you
all
the
time
and
your
upper
jaw
did
not
move
once
that
was
the
only
fact
that
he
had
taken
in
living
things
then
moving
things
or
things
that
savor
of
danger
or
of
blood
that
have
a
dramatic
quality
these
are
the
objects
natively
interesting
to
childhood
to
the
exclusion
of
almost
everything
else
and
the
teacher
of
young
children
until
more
artificial
interests
have
grown
up
will
keep
in
touch
with
her
pupils
by
constant
appeal
to
such
matters
as
these
instruction
must
be
carried
on
objectively
experimentally
anecdotally
the
and
must
constantly
come
in
but
of
course
these
methods
cover
only
the
first
steps
and
carry
one
but
a
little
way
can
we
now
formulate
any
general
principle
by
which
the
later
and
more
artificial
interests
connect
themselves
with
these
early
ones
that
the
child
brings
with
him
to
the
school
fortunately
we
can
there
is
a
very
simple
law
that
relates
the
acquired
and
the
native
interests
with
each
other
object
not
interesting
in
itself
may
become
interesting
through
becoming
associated
with
an
object
in
which
an
interest
already
exists
the
two
associated
objects
grow
as
it
were
together
the
interesting
portion
sheds
its
quality
over
the
whole
and
thus
things
not
interesting
in
their
own
right
borrow
an
interest
which
becomes
as
real
and
as
strong
as
that
of
any
natively
interesting
the
odd
circumstance
is
that
the
borrowing
does
not
impoverish
the
source
the
objects
taken
together
being
more
interesting
perhaps
than
the
originally
interesting
portion
was
by
itself
this
is
one
of
the
most
striking
proofs
of
the
range
of
application
of
the
principle
of
association
of
ideas
in
psychology
an
idea
will
infect
another
with
its
own
emotional
interest
when
they
have
become
both
associated
together
into
any
sort
of
a
mental
total
as
there
is
no
limit
to
the
various
associations
into
which
an
interesting
idea
may
enter
one
sees
in
how
many
ways
an
interest
may
be
derived
you
will
understand
this
abstract
statement
easily
if
i
take
the
most
frequent
of
concrete
examples
the
interest
which
things
borrow
from
their
connection
with
our
own
personal
welfare
the
most
natively
interesting
object
to
a
man
is
his
own
personal
self
and
its
fortunes
we
accordingly
see
that
the
moment
a
thing
becomes
connected
with
the
fortunes
of
the
self
it
forthwith
becomes
an
interesting
thing
lend
the
child
his
books
pencils
and
other
apparatus
then
give
them
to
him
make
them
his
own
and
notice
the
new
light
with
which
they
instantly
shine
in
his
eyes
he
takes
a
new
kind
of
care
of
them
altogether
in
mature
life
all
the
drudgery
of
a
man
business
or
profession
intolerable
in
itself
is
shot
through
with
engrossing
significance
because
he
knows
it
to
be
associated
with
his
personal
fortunes
what
more
deadly
uninteresting
object
can
there
be
than
a
railroad
yet
where
will
you
find
a
more
interesting
object
if
you
are
going
on
a
journey
and
by
its
means
can
find
your
train
at
such
times
the
will
absorb
a
man
entire
attention
its
interest
being
borrowed
solely
from
its
relation
to
his
personal
life
all
these
facts
there
emerges
a
very
simple
abstract
programme
for
the
teacher
to
follow
in
keeping
the
attention
of
the
child
begin
with
the
line
of
his
native
interests
and
offer
him
objects
that
have
some
immediate
connection
with
the
kindergarten
methods
the
routine
the
blackboard
and
work
all
recognize
this
feature
schools
in
which
these
methods
preponderate
are
schools
where
discipline
is
easy
and
where
the
voice
of
the
master
claiming
order
and
attention
in
threatening
tones
need
never
be
heard
step
by
step
connect
with
these
first
objects
and
experiences
the
later
objects
and
ideas
which
you
wish
to
instill
associate
the
new
with
the
old
in
some
natural
and
telling
way
so
that
the
interest
being
shed
along
from
point
to
point
finally
suffuses
the
entire
system
of
objects
of
this
is
the
abstract
statement
and
abstractly
nothing
can
be
easier
to
understand
it
is
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
rule
that
the
difficulty
lies
for
the
difference
between
an
interesting
and
a
tedious
teacher
consists
in
little
more
than
the
inventiveness
by
which
the
one
is
able
to
mediate
these
associations
and
connections
and
in
the
dulness
in
discovering
such
transitions
which
the
other
shows
one
teacher
mind
will
fairly
coruscate
with
points
of
connection
between
the
new
lesson
and
the
circumstances
of
the
children
other
experience
anecdotes
and
reminiscences
will
abound
in
her
talk
and
the
shuttle
of
interest
will
shoot
backward
and
forward
weaving
the
new
and
the
old
together
in
a
lively
and
entertaining
way
another
teacher
has
no
such
inventive
fertility
and
his
lesson
will
always
be
a
dead
and
heavy
thing
this
is
the
psychological
meaning
of
the
herbartian
principle
of
for
each
lesson
and
of
correlating
the
new
with
the
old
it
is
the
psychological
meaning
of
that
whole
method
of
concentration
in
studies
of
which
you
have
been
recently
hearing
so
much
when
the
geography
and
english
and
history
and
arithmetic
simultaneously
make
to
one
another
you
get
an
interesting
set
of
processes
all
along
the
line
if
then
you
wish
to
insure
the
interest
of
your
pupils
there
is
only
one
way
to
do
it
and
that
is
to
make
certain
that
they
have
something
in
their
minds
attend
when
you
begin
to
talk
that
something
can
consist
in
nothing
but
a
previous
lot
of
ideas
already
interesting
in
themselves
and
of
such
a
nature
that
the
incoming
novel
objects
which
you
present
can
dovetail
into
them
and
form
with
them
some
kind
of
a
logically
associated
or
systematic
whole
fortunately
almost
any
kind
of
a
connection
is
sufficient
to
carry
the
interest
along
what
a
help
is
our
philippine
war
at
present
in
teaching
geography
but
before
the
war
you
could
ask
the
children
if
they
ate
pepper
with
their
eggs
and
where
they
supposed
the
pepper
came
from
or
ask
them
if
glass
is
a
stone
and
if
not
why
not
and
then
let
them
know
how
stones
are
formed
and
glass
manufactured
external
links
will
serve
as
well
as
those
that
are
deeper
and
more
logical
but
interest
once
shed
upon
a
subject
is
liable
to
remain
always
with
that
subject
our
acquisitions
become
in
a
measure
portions
of
our
personal
self
and
little
by
little
as
multiply
and
habits
of
familiarity
and
practice
grow
the
entire
system
of
our
objects
of
thought
consolidates
most
of
it
becoming
interesting
for
some
purposes
and
in
some
degree
an
adult
man
interests
are
almost
every
one
of
them
intensely
artificial
they
have
slowly
been
built
up
the
objects
of
professional
interest
are
most
of
them
in
their
original
nature
repulsive
but
by
their
connection
with
such
natively
exciting
objects
as
one
personal
fortune
one
social
responsibilities
and
especially
by
the
force
of
inveterate
habit
they
grow
to
be
the
only
things
for
which
in
middle
life
a
man
profoundly
cares
but
in
all
these
the
spread
and
consolidation
have
followed
nothing
but
the
principles
first
laid
down
if
we
could
recall
for
a
moment
our
whole
individual
history
we
should
see
that
our
professional
ideals
and
the
zeal
they
inspire
are
due
to
nothing
but
the
slow
accretion
of
one
mental
object
to
another
traceable
backward
from
point
to
point
till
we
reach
the
moment
when
in
the
nursery
or
in
the
schoolroom
some
little
story
told
some
little
object
shown
some
little
operation
witnessed
brought
the
first
new
object
and
new
interest
within
our
ken
by
associating
it
with
some
one
of
those
primitively
there
the
interest
now
suffusing
the
whole
system
took
its
rise
in
that
little
event
so
insignificant
to
us
now
as
to
be
entirely
forgotten
as
the
bees
in
swarming
cling
to
one
another
in
layers
till
the
few
are
reached
whose
feet
grapple
the
bough
from
which
the
swarm
depends
so
with
the
objects
of
our
thinking
they
hang
to
each
other
by
associated
links
but
the
source
of
interest
in
all
of
them
is
the
native
interest
which
the
earliest
one
once
possessed
xi
attention
whoever
treats
of
interest
inevitably
treats
of
attention
for
to
say
that
an
object
is
interesting
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
it
excites
attention
but
in
addition
to
the
attention
which
any
object
already
interesting
or
just
becoming
interesting
claims
passive
attention
or
spontaneous
attention
we
may
call
it
there
is
a
more
deliberate
attention
voluntary
attention
or
attention
with
effort
as
it
is
called
which
we
can
give
to
objects
less
interesting
or
uninteresting
in
themselves
the
distinction
between
active
and
passive
attention
is
made
in
all
books
on
psychology
and
connects
itself
with
the
deeper
aspects
of
the
topic
from
our
present
purely
practical
point
of
view
however
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
intricate
and
passive
attention
to
natively
interesting
material
requires
no
further
elucidation
on
this
occasion
all
that
we
need
explicitly
to
note
is
that
the
more
the
passive
attention
is
relied
on
by
keeping
the
material
interesting
and
the
less
the
kind
of
attention
requiring
effort
is
appealed
to
the
more
smoothly
and
pleasantly
the
classroom
work
goes
on
i
must
say
a
few
more
words
however
about
this
latter
process
of
voluntary
and
deliberate
attention
one
often
hears
it
said
that
genius
is
nothing
but
a
power
of
sustained
attention
and
the
popular
impression
probably
prevails
that
men
of
genius
are
remarkable
for
their
voluntary
powers
in
this
direction
a
little
introspective
observation
will
show
any
one
that
voluntary
attention
can
not
be
continuously
sustained
that
it
comes
in
when
we
are
studying
an
uninteresting
subject
if
our
mind
tends
to
wander
we
have
to
bring
back
our
attention
every
now
and
then
by
using
distinct
pulses
of
effort
which
revivify
the
topic
for
a
moment
the
mind
then
running
on
for
a
certain
number
of
seconds
or
minutes
with
spontaneous
interest
until
again
some
intercurrent
idea
captures
it
and
takes
it
off
then
the
processes
of
volitional
recall
must
be
repeated
once
more
voluntary
attention
in
short
is
only
a
momentary
affair
the
process
whatever
it
is
exhausts
itself
in
the
single
act
and
unless
the
matter
is
then
taken
in
hand
by
some
trace
of
interest
inherent
in
the
subject
the
mind
fails
to
follow
it
at
all
the
sustained
attention
of
the
genius
sticking
to
his
subject
for
hours
together
is
for
the
most
part
of
the
passive
sort
the
minds
of
geniuses
are
full
of
copious
and
original
associations
the
subject
of
thought
once
started
develops
all
sorts
of
fascinating
consequences
the
attention
is
led
along
one
of
these
to
another
in
the
most
interesting
manner
and
the
attention
never
once
tends
to
stray
away
in
a
commonplace
mind
on
the
other
hand
a
subject
develops
much
less
numerous
associates
it
dies
out
then
quickly
and
if
the
man
is
to
keep
up
thinking
of
it
at
all
he
must
bring
his
attention
back
to
it
by
a
violent
wrench
in
him
therefore
the
faculty
of
voluntary
attention
receives
abundant
opportunity
for
cultivation
in
daily
life
it
is
your
despised
business
man
your
common
man
of
affairs
so
looked
down
on
by
the
literary
awarders
of
fame
whose
virtue
in
this
regard
is
likely
to
be
most
developed
for
he
has
to
listen
to
the
concerns
of
so
many
uninteresting
people
and
to
transact
so
much
drudging
detail
that
the
faculty
in
question
is
always
kept
in
training
a
genius
on
the
contrary
is
the
man
in
whom
you
are
least
likely
to
find
the
power
of
attending
to
anything
insipid
or
distasteful
in
itself
he
breaks
his
engagements
leaves
his
letters
unanswered
neglects
his
family
duties
incorrigibly
because
he
is
powerless
to
turn
his
attention
down
and
back
from
those
more
interesting
trains
of
imagery
with
which
his
genius
constantly
occupies
his
mind
voluntary
attention
is
thus
an
essentially
instantaneous
affair
you
can
claim
it
for
your
purposes
in
the
schoolroom
by
commanding
it
in
loud
imperious
tones
and
you
can
easily
get
it
in
this
way
but
unless
the
subject
to
which
you
thus
recall
their
attention
has
inherent
power
to
interest
the
pupils
you
will
have
got
it
for
only
a
brief
moment
and
their
minds
will
soon
be
wandering
again
to
keep
them
where
you
have
called
them
you
must
make
the
subject
too
interesting
for
them
to
wander
again
and
for
that
there
is
one
prescription
but
the
prescription
like
all
our
prescriptions
is
abstract
and
to
get
practical
results
from
it
you
must
couple
it
with
the
prescription
is
that
subject
must
be
made
to
show
new
aspects
of
itself
to
prompt
new
questions
in
a
word
to
from
an
unchanging
subject
the
attention
inevitably
wanders
away
you
can
test
this
by
the
simplest
possible
case
of
sensorial
attention
try
to
attend
steadfastly
to
a
dot
on
the
paper
or
on
the
wall
you
presently
find
that
one
or
the
other
of
two
things
has
happened
either
your
field
of
vision
has
become
blurred
so
that
you
now
see
nothing
distinct
at
all
or
else
you
have
involuntarily
ceased
to
look
at
the
dot
in
question
and
are
looking
at
something
else
but
if
you
ask
yourself
successive
questions
about
the
dot
how
big
it
is
how
far
of
what
shape
what
shade
of
color
etc
in
other
words
if
you
turn
it
over
if
you
think
of
it
in
various
ways
and
along
with
various
kinds
of
associates
you
can
keep
your
mind
on
it
for
a
comparatively
long
time
this
is
what
the
genius
does
in
whose
hands
a
given
topic
coruscates
and
grows
and
this
is
what
the
teacher
must
do
for
every
topic
if
he
wishes
to
avoid
too
frequent
appeals
to
voluntary
attention
of
the
coerced
sort
in
all
respects
reliance
upon
such
attention
as
this
is
a
wasteful
method
bringing
bad
temper
and
nervous
wear
and
tear
as
well
as
imperfect
results
the
teacher
who
can
get
along
by
keeping
spontaneous
interest
excited
must
be
regarded
as
the
teacher
with
the
greatest
skill
there
is
however
in
all
schoolroom
work
a
large
mass
of
material
that
must
be
dull
and
unexciting
and
to
which
it
is
impossible
in
any
continuous
way
to
contribute
an
interest
associatively
derived
there
are
therefore
certain
external
methods
which
every
teacher
knows
of
voluntarily
arousing
the
attention
from
time
to
time
and
keeping
it
upon
the
subject
fitch
has
a
lecture
on
the
art
of
securing
attention
and
he
briefly
passes
these
methods
in
review
the
posture
must
be
changed
places
can
be
changed
questions
after
being
answered
singly
may
occasionally
be
answered
in
concert
elliptical
questions
may
be
asked
the
pupil
supplying
the
missing
word
the
teacher
must
pounce
upon
the
most
listless
child
and
wake
him
up
the
habit
of
prompt
and
ready
response
must
be
kept
up
recapitulations
illustrations
examples
novelty
of
order
and
ruptures
of
routine
all
these
are
means
for
keeping
the
attention
alive
and
contributing
a
little
interest
to
a
dull
subject
above
all
the
teacher
must
himself
be
alive
and
ready
and
must
use
the
contagion
of
his
own
example
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
fact
remains
that
some
teachers
have
a
naturally
inspiring
presence
and
can
make
their
exercises
interesting
while
others
simply
can
not
and
psychology
and
general
pedagogy
here
confess
their
failure
and
hand
things
over
to
the
deeper
springs
of
human
personality
to
conduct
the
task
a
brief
reference
to
the
physiological
theory
of
the
attentive
process
may
serve
still
further
to
elucidate
these
practical
remarks
and
confirm
them
by
showing
them
from
a
slightly
different
point
of
view
what
is
the
attentive
process
psychologically
considered
attention
to
an
object
is
what
takes
place
whenever
that
object
most
completely
occupies
the
mind
for
simplicity
sake
suppose
the
object
be
an
object
of
sensation
a
figure
approaching
us
at
a
distance
on
the
road
it
is
far
off
barely
perceptible
and
hardly
moving
we
do
not
know
with
certainty
whether
it
is
a
man
or
not
such
an
object
as
this
if
carelessly
looked
at
may
hardly
catch
our
attention
at
all
the
optical
impression
may
affect
solely
the
marginal
consciousness
while
the
mental
focus
keeps
engaged
with
rival
things
we
may
indeed
not
it
till
some
one
points
it
out
but
if
so
how
does
he
point
it
out
by
his
finger
and
by
describing
its
appearance
by
creating
a
premonitory
image
of
to
look
and
of
to
expect
to
see
this
premonitory
image
is
already
an
excitement
of
the
same
that
are
to
be
concerned
with
the
impression
the
impression
comes
and
excites
them
still
further
and
now
the
object
enters
the
focus
of
the
field
consciousness
being
sustained
both
by
impression
and
by
preliminary
idea
but
the
maximum
of
attention
to
it
is
not
yet
reached
although
we
see
it
we
may
not
care
for
it
it
may
suggest
nothing
important
to
us
and
a
rival
stream
of
objects
or
of
thoughts
may
quickly
take
our
mind
away
if
however
our
companion
defines
it
in
a
significant
way
arouses
in
the
mind
a
set
of
experiences
to
be
apprehended
from
it
names
it
an
enemy
or
as
a
messenger
of
important
tidings
the
residual
and
marginal
ideas
now
aroused
so
far
from
being
its
rivals
become
its
associates
and
allies
they
shoot
together
into
one
system
with
it
they
converge
upon
it
they
keep
it
steadily
in
focus
the
mind
attends
to
it
with
maximum
power
the
attentive
process
therefore
at
its
maximum
may
be
physiologically
symbolized
by
a
played
on
in
two
ways
from
without
and
from
within
incoming
currents
from
the
periphery
arouse
it
and
collateral
currents
from
the
centres
of
memory
and
imagination
these
in
this
process
the
incoming
impression
is
the
newer
element
the
ideas
which
and
sustain
it
are
among
the
older
possessions
of
the
mind
and
the
maximum
of
attention
may
then
be
said
to
be
found
whenever
we
have
a
systematic
harmony
or
unification
between
the
novel
and
the
old
it
is
an
odd
circumstance
that
neither
the
old
nor
the
new
by
itself
is
interesting
the
absolutely
old
is
insipid
the
absolutely
new
makes
no
appeal
at
all
the
old
the
new
is
what
claims
the
attention
the
old
with
a
slightly
new
turn
no
one
wants
to
hear
a
lecture
on
a
subject
completely
disconnected
with
his
previous
knowledge
but
we
all
like
lectures
on
subjects
of
which
we
know
a
little
already
just
as
in
the
fashions
every
year
must
bring
its
slight
modification
of
last
year
suit
but
an
abrupt
jump
from
the
fashion
of
one
decade
into
another
would
be
distasteful
to
the
eye
the
genius
of
the
interesting
teacher
consists
in
sympathetic
divination
of
the
sort
of
material
with
which
the
pupil
mind
is
likely
to
be
already
spontaneously
engaged
and
in
the
ingenuity
which
discovers
paths
of
connection
from
that
material
to
the
matters
to
be
newly
learned
the
principle
is
easy
to
grasp
but
the
accomplishment
is
difficult
in
the
extreme
and
a
knowledge
of
such
psychology
as
this
which
i
am
recalling
can
no
more
make
a
good
teacher
than
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
perspective
can
make
a
landscape
painter
of
effective
skill
a
certain
doubt
may
now
occur
to
some
of
you
a
while
ago
apropos
of
the
pugnacious
instinct
i
spoke
of
our
modern
pedagogy
as
being
possibly
too
you
may
perhaps
here
face
me
with
my
own
words
and
ask
whether
the
exclusive
effort
on
the
teacher
part
to
keep
the
pupil
spontaneous
interest
going
and
to
avoid
the
more
strenuous
path
of
voluntary
attention
to
repulsive
work
does
not
savor
also
of
sentimentalism
the
greater
part
of
schoolroom
work
you
say
must
in
the
nature
of
things
always
be
repulsive
to
face
uninteresting
drudgery
is
a
good
part
of
life
work
why
seek
to
eliminate
it
from
the
schoolroom
or
minimize
the
sterner
law
a
word
or
two
will
obviate
what
might
perhaps
become
a
serious
misunderstanding
here
it
is
certain
that
most
schoolroom
work
till
it
has
become
habitual
and
automatic
is
repulsive
and
can
not
be
done
without
voluntarily
jerking
back
the
attention
to
it
every
now
and
then
this
is
inevitable
let
the
teacher
do
what
he
will
it
flows
from
the
inherent
nature
of
the
subjects
and
of
the
learning
mind
the
repulsive
processes
of
verbal
memorizing
of
discovering
steps
of
mathematical
identity
and
the
like
must
borrow
their
interest
at
first
from
purely
external
sources
mainly
from
the
personal
interests
with
which
success
in
mastering
them
is
associated
such
as
gaining
of
rank
avoiding
punishment
not
being
beaten
by
a
difficulty
and
the
like
without
such
borrowed
interest
the
child
could
not
attend
to
them
at
all
but
in
these
processes
what
becomes
interesting
enough
to
be
attended
to
is
not
thereby
attended
to
effort
always
has
to
go
on
derived
interest
for
the
most
part
not
awakening
attention
that
is
however
spontaneous
it
may
now
have
to
be
called
the
interest
which
the
teacher
by
his
utmost
skill
can
lend
to
the
subject
proves
over
and
over
again
to
be
only
an
interest
sufficient
let
loose
the
the
teacher
therefore
need
never
concern
himself
about
occasions
where
effort
must
be
called
into
play
let
him
still
awaken
whatever
sources
of
interest
in
the
subject
he
can
by
stirring
up
connections
between
it
and
the
nature
whether
in
the
line
of
theoretic
curiosity
of
personal
interest
or
of
pugnacious
impulse
the
laws
of
mind
will
then
bring
enough
pulses
of
effort
into
play
to
keep
the
pupil
exercised
in
the
direction
of
the
subject
there
is
in
fact
no
greater
school
of
effort
than
the
steady
struggle
to
attend
to
immediately
repulsive
or
difficult
objects
of
thought
which
have
grown
to
interest
us
through
their
association
as
means
with
some
remote
ideal
end
the
herbartian
doctrine
of
interest
ought
not
therefore
in
principle
to
be
reproached
with
making
pedagogy
soft
if
it
do
so
it
is
because
it
is
unintelligently
carried
on
do
not
then
for
the
mere
sake
of
discipline
command
attention
from
your
pupils
in
thundering
tones
do
not
too
often
beg
it
from
them
as
a
favor
nor
claim
it
as
a
right
nor
try
habitually
to
excite
it
by
preaching
the
importance
of
the
subject
sometimes
indeed
you
must
do
these
things
but
the
more
you
have
to
do
them
the
less
skilful
teacher
you
will
show
yourself
to
be
elicit
interest
from
within
by
the
warmth
with
which
you
care
for
the
topic
yourself
and
by
following
the
laws
i
have
laid
down
if
the
topic
be
highly
abstract
show
its
nature
by
concrete
examples
if
it
be
unfamiliar
trace
some
point
of
analogy
in
it
with
the
known
if
it
be
inhuman
make
it
figure
as
part
of
a
story
if
it
be
difficult
couple
its
acquisition
with
some
prospect
of
personal
gain
above
all
things
make
sure
that
it
shall
run
through
certain
inner
changes
since
no
unvarying
object
can
possibly
hold
the
mental
field
for
long
let
your
pupil
wander
from
one
aspect
to
another
of
your
subject
if
you
do
not
wish
him
to
wander
from
it
altogether
to
something
else
variety
in
unity
being
the
secret
of
all
interesting
talk
and
thought
the
relation
of
all
these
things
to
the
native
genius
of
the
instructor
is
too
obvious
to
need
comment
again
one
more
point
and
i
am
done
with
the
subject
of
attention
there
is
unquestionably
a
great
native
variety
among
individuals
in
the
type
of
their
attention
some
of
us
are
naturally
scatterbrained
and
others
follow
easily
a
train
of
connected
thoughts
without
temptation
to
swerve
aside
to
other
subjects
this
seems
to
depend
on
a
difference
between
individuals
in
the
type
of
their
field
of
consciousness
in
some
persons
this
is
highly
focalized
and
concentrated
and
the
focal
ideas
predominate
in
determining
association
in
others
we
must
suppose
the
margin
to
be
brighter
and
to
be
filled
with
something
like
meteoric
showers
of
images
which
strike
into
it
at
random
displacing
the
focal
ideas
and
carrying
association
in
their
own
direction
persons
of
the
latter
type
find
their
attention
wandering
every
minute
and
must
bring
it
back
by
a
voluntary
pull
the
others
sink
into
a
subject
of
meditation
deeply
and
when
interrupted
are
for
a
moment
before
they
come
back
to
the
outer
world
the
possession
of
such
a
steady
faculty
of
attention
is
unquestionably
a
great
boon
those
who
have
it
can
work
more
rapidly
and
with
less
nervous
wear
and
tear
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
no
one
who
is
without
it
naturally
can
by
any
amount
of
drill
or
discipline
attain
it
in
a
very
high
degree
its
amount
is
probably
a
fixed
characteristic
of
the
individual
but
i
wish
to
make
a
remark
here
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
make
again
in
other
connections
it
is
that
no
one
need
deplore
unduly
the
inferiority
in
himself
of
any
one
elementary
faculty
this
concentrated
type
of
attention
is
an
elementary
faculty
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
might
be
ascertained
and
measured
by
exercises
in
the
laboratory
but
having
ascertained
it
in
a
number
of
persons
we
could
never
rank
them
in
a
scale
of
actual
and
practical
mental
efficiency
based
on
its
degrees
the
total
mental
efficiency
of
a
man
is
the
resultant
of
the
working
together
of
all
his
faculties
he
is
too
complex
a
being
for
any
one
of
them
to
have
the
casting
vote
if
any
one
of
them
do
have
the
casting
vote
it
is
more
likely
to
be
the
strength
of
his
desire
and
passion
the
strength
of
the
interest
he
takes
in
what
is
proposed
concentration
memory
reasoning
power
inventiveness
excellence
of
the
senses
all
are
subsidiary
to
this
no
matter
how
the
type
of
a
man
successive
fields
of
consciousness
may
be
if
he
really
for
a
subject
he
will
return
to
it
incessantly
from
his
incessant
wanderings
and
first
and
last
do
more
with
it
and
get
more
results
from
it
than
another
person
whose
attention
may
be
more
continuous
during
a
given
interval
but
whose
passion
for
the
subject
is
of
a
more
languid
and
less
permanent
sort
some
of
the
most
efficient
workers
i
know
are
of
the
type
one
friend
who
does
a
prodigious
quantity
of
work
has
in
fact
confessed
to
me
that
if
he
wants
to
get
ideas
on
any
subject
he
sits
down
to
work
at
something
else
his
best
results
coming
through
his
this
is
perhaps
an
epigrammatic
exaggeration
on
his
part
but
i
seriously
think
that
no
one
of
us
need
be
too
much
distressed
at
his
own
shortcomings
in
this
regard
our
mind
may
enjoy
but
little
comfort
may
be
restless
and
feel
confused
but
it
may
be
extremely
efficient
all
the
same
xii
memory
we
are
following
a
somewhat
arbitrary
order
since
each
and
every
faculty
we
possess
is
either
in
whole
or
in
part
a
resultant
of
the
play
of
our
associations
it
would
have
been
as
natural
after
treating
of
association
to
treat
of
memory
as
to
treat
of
interest
and
attention
next
but
since
we
did
take
the
latter
operations
first
we
must
take
memory
now
without
farther
delay
for
the
phenomena
of
memory
are
among
the
simplest
and
most
immediate
consequences
of
the
fact
that
our
mind
is
essentially
an
associating
machine
there
is
no
more
example
for
exhibiting
the
fertility
of
the
laws
of
association
as
principles
of
psychological
analysis
memory
moreover
is
so
important
a
faculty
in
the
schoolroom
that
you
are
probably
waiting
with
some
eagerness
to
know
what
psychology
has
to
say
about
it
for
your
help
in
old
times
if
you
asked
a
person
to
explain
why
he
came
to
be
remembering
at
that
moment
some
particular
incident
in
his
previous
life
the
only
reply
he
could
make
was
that
his
soul
is
endowed
with
a
faculty
called
memory
that
it
is
the
inalienable
function
of
this
faculty
to
recollect
and
that
therefore
he
necessarily
at
that
moment
must
have
a
cognition
of
that
portion
of
the
past
this
explanation
by
a
is
one
thing
which
explanation
by
association
has
superseded
altogether
if
by
saying
we
have
a
faculty
of
memory
you
mean
nothing
more
than
the
fact
that
we
can
remember
nothing
more
than
an
abstract
name
for
our
power
inwardly
to
recall
the
past
there
is
no
harm
done
we
do
have
the
faculty
for
we
unquestionably
have
such
a
power
but
if
by
faculty
you
mean
a
principle
of
of
our
general
power
to
your
psychology
is
empty
the
associationist
psychology
on
the
other
hand
gives
an
explanation
of
each
particular
fact
of
recollection
and
in
so
doing
it
also
gives
an
explanation
of
the
general
faculty
the
of
memory
is
thus
no
real
or
ultimate
explanation
for
it
is
itself
explained
as
a
result
of
the
association
of
ideas
nothing
is
easier
than
to
show
you
just
what
i
mean
by
this
suppose
i
am
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
say
in
commanding
accents
remember
recollect
does
your
faculty
of
memory
obey
the
order
and
reproduce
any
definite
image
from
your
past
certainly
not
it
stands
staring
into
vacancy
and
asking
what
kind
of
a
thing
do
you
wish
me
to
remember
it
needs
in
short
a
but
if
i
say
remember
the
date
of
your
birth
or
remember
what
you
had
for
breakfast
or
remember
the
succession
of
notes
in
the
musical
scale
then
your
faculty
of
memory
immediately
produces
the
required
result
the
determines
its
vast
set
of
potentialities
toward
a
particular
point
and
if
you
now
look
to
see
how
this
happens
you
immediately
perceive
that
the
cue
is
something
with
the
thing
recalled
the
words
of
my
birth
have
an
ingrained
association
with
a
particular
number
month
and
year
the
words
this
morning
cut
off
all
other
lines
of
recall
except
those
which
lead
to
coffee
and
bacon
and
eggs
the
words
scale
are
inveterate
mental
neighbors
of
do
ré
mi
fa
sol
la
etc
the
laws
of
association
govern
in
fact
all
the
trains
of
our
thinking
which
are
not
interrupted
by
sensations
breaking
on
us
from
without
whatever
appears
in
the
mind
must
be
and
when
introduced
it
is
as
the
associate
of
something
already
there
this
is
as
true
of
what
you
are
recollecting
as
it
is
of
everything
else
you
think
of
reflection
will
show
you
that
there
are
peculiarities
in
your
memory
which
would
be
quite
whimsical
and
unaccountable
if
we
were
forced
to
regard
them
as
the
product
of
a
purely
spiritual
faculty
were
memory
such
a
faculty
granted
to
us
solely
for
its
practical
use
we
ought
to
remember
easiest
whatever
we
most
to
remember
and
frequency
of
repetition
recency
and
the
like
would
play
no
part
in
the
matter
that
we
should
best
remember
frequent
things
and
recent
things
and
forget
things
that
are
ancient
or
were
experienced
only
once
could
only
be
regarded
as
an
incomprehensible
anomaly
on
such
a
view
but
if
we
remember
because
of
our
associations
and
if
these
are
as
the
physiological
psychologists
believe
due
to
our
organized
we
easily
see
how
the
law
of
recency
and
repetition
should
prevail
paths
frequently
and
recently
ploughed
are
those
that
lie
most
open
those
which
may
be
expected
most
easily
to
lead
to
results
the
laws
of
our
memory
as
we
find
them
therefore
are
incidents
of
our
associational
constitution
and
when
we
are
emancipated
from
the
flesh
it
is
conceivable
that
they
may
no
longer
continue
to
obtain
we
may
assume
then
that
recollection
is
a
resultant
of
our
associative
processes
these
themselves
in
the
last
analysis
being
most
probably
due
to
the
workings
of
our
brain
descending
more
particularly
into
the
faculty
of
memory
we
have
to
distinguish
between
its
potential
aspect
as
a
magazine
or
storehouse
and
its
actual
aspect
as
recollection
now
of
a
particular
event
our
memory
contains
all
sorts
of
items
which
we
do
not
now
recall
but
which
we
may
recall
provided
a
sufficient
cue
be
offered
both
the
general
retention
and
the
special
recall
are
explained
by
association
an
educated
memory
depends
on
an
organized
system
of
associations
and
its
goodness
depends
on
two
of
their
peculiarities
first
on
the
persistency
of
the
associations
and
second
on
their
number
let
us
consider
each
of
these
points
in
turn
first
the
persistency
of
the
associations
this
gives
what
may
be
called
the
of
native
to
the
individual
if
as
i
think
we
are
forced
to
we
consider
the
brain
to
be
the
organic
condition
by
which
the
vestiges
of
our
experience
are
associated
with
each
other
we
may
suppose
that
some
brains
are
to
receive
and
marble
to
retain
the
slightest
impressions
made
on
them
abide
names
dates
prices
anecdotes
quotations
are
indelibly
retained
their
several
elements
fixedly
cohering
together
so
that
the
individual
soon
becomes
a
walking
cyclopædia
of
information
all
this
may
occur
with
no
philosophic
tendency
in
the
mind
no
impulse
to
weave
the
materials
acquired
into
anything
like
a
logical
system
in
the
books
of
anecdotes
and
more
recently
in
the
we
find
recorded
instances
of
monstrosities
as
we
may
call
them
of
this
desultory
memory
and
they
are
often
otherwise
very
stupid
men
it
is
of
course
by
no
means
incompatible
with
a
philosophic
mind
for
mental
characteristics
have
infinite
capacities
for
permutation
and
when
both
memory
and
philosophy
combine
together
in
one
person
then
indeed
we
have
the
highest
sort
of
intellectual
efficiency
your
walter
scotts
your
leibnitzes
your
gladstones
and
your
goethes
all
your
folio
copies
of
mankind
belong
to
this
type
efficiency
on
a
colossal
scale
would
indeed
seem
to
require
it
for
although
your
philosophic
or
systematic
mind
without
good
desultory
memory
may
know
how
to
work
out
results
and
recollect
where
in
the
books
to
find
them
the
time
lost
in
the
searching
process
handicaps
the
thinker
and
gives
to
the
more
ready
type
of
individual
the
economical
advantage
the
extreme
of
the
contrasted
type
the
type
with
associations
of
small
persistency
is
found
in
those
who
have
almost
no
desultory
memory
at
all
if
they
are
also
deficient
in
logical
and
systematizing
power
we
call
them
simply
feeble
intellects
and
no
more
need
to
be
said
about
them
here
their
we
may
imagine
is
like
a
fluid
jelly
in
which
impressions
may
be
easily
made
but
are
soon
closed
over
again
so
that
the
brain
reverts
to
its
original
indifferent
state
but
it
may
occur
here
just
as
in
other
gelatinous
substances
that
an
impression
will
vibrate
throughout
the
brain
and
send
waves
into
other
parts
of
it
in
cases
of
this
sort
although
the
immediate
impression
may
fade
out
quickly
it
does
modify
the
cerebral
mass
for
the
paths
it
makes
there
may
remain
and
become
so
many
avenues
through
which
the
impression
may
be
reproduced
if
they
ever
get
excited
again
and
its
liability
to
reproduction
will
depend
of
course
upon
the
variety
of
these
paths
and
upon
the
frequency
with
which
they
are
used
each
path
is
in
fact
an
associated
process
the
number
of
these
associates
becoming
thus
to
a
great
degree
a
substitute
for
the
independent
tenacity
of
the
original
impression
as
i
have
elsewhere
written
each
of
the
associates
is
a
hook
to
which
it
hangs
a
means
to
fish
it
up
when
sunk
below
the
surface
together
they
form
a
network
of
attachments
by
which
it
is
woven
into
the
entire
tissue
of
our
thought
the
of
a
good
memory
is
thus
the
secret
of
forming
diverse
and
multiple
associations
with
every
fact
we
care
to
retain
but
this
forming
of
associations
with
a
fact
what
is
it
but
thinking
the
fact
as
much
as
possible
briefly
then
of
two
men
with
the
same
outward
experiences
one
who
thinks
over
his
experiences
and
weaves
them
into
the
most
systematic
relations
with
each
other
will
be
the
one
with
the
best
memory
but
if
our
ability
to
recollect
a
thing
be
so
largely
a
matter
of
its
associations
with
other
things
which
thus
becomes
its
cues
an
important
pædagogic
consequence
follows
can
be
no
improvement
of
the
general
or
elementary
faculty
of
memory
there
can
only
be
improvement
of
our
memory
for
special
systems
of
associated
and
this
latter
improvement
is
due
to
the
way
in
which
the
things
in
question
are
woven
into
association
with
each
other
in
the
mind
intricately
or
profoundly
woven
they
are
held
disconnected
they
tend
to
drop
out
just
in
proportion
as
the
native
brain
retentiveness
is
poor
and
no
amount
of
training
drilling
repeating
and
reciting
employed
upon
the
matter
of
one
system
of
objects
the
for
example
will
in
the
least
improve
either
the
facility
or
the
durability
with
which
objects
belonging
to
a
wholly
disparate
system
the
system
of
facts
of
chemistry
for
instance
tend
to
be
retained
that
system
must
be
separately
worked
into
the
mind
by
itself
a
chemical
fact
which
is
thought
about
in
connection
with
the
other
chemical
facts
tending
then
to
stay
but
otherwise
easily
dropping
out
we
have
then
not
so
much
a
faculty
of
memory
as
many
faculties
of
memory
we
have
as
many
as
we
have
systems
of
objects
habitually
thought
of
in
connection
with
each
other
a
given
object
is
held
in
the
memory
by
the
associates
it
has
acquired
within
its
own
system
exclusively
learning
the
facts
of
another
system
will
in
no
wise
help
it
to
stay
in
the
mind
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
has
no
within
that
other
system
we
see
examples
of
this
on
every
hand
most
men
have
a
good
memory
for
facts
connected
with
their
own
pursuits
a
college
athlete
who
remains
a
dunce
at
his
books
may
amaze
you
by
his
knowledge
of
the
at
various
feats
and
games
and
prove
himself
a
walking
dictionary
of
sporting
statistics
the
reason
is
that
he
is
constantly
going
over
these
things
in
his
mind
and
comparing
and
making
series
of
them
they
form
for
him
not
so
many
odd
facts
but
a
so
they
stick
so
the
merchant
remembers
prices
the
politician
other
politicians
speeches
and
votes
with
a
copiousness
which
astonishes
outsiders
but
which
the
amount
of
thinking
they
bestow
on
these
subjects
easily
explains
the
great
memory
for
facts
which
a
darwin
or
a
spencer
reveal
in
their
books
is
not
incompatible
with
the
possession
on
their
part
of
a
mind
with
only
a
middling
degree
of
physiological
retentiveness
let
a
man
early
in
life
set
himself
the
task
of
verifying
such
a
theory
as
that
of
evolution
and
facts
will
soon
cluster
and
cling
to
him
like
grapes
to
their
stem
their
relations
to
the
theory
will
hold
them
fast
and
the
more
of
these
the
mind
is
able
to
discern
the
greater
the
erudition
will
become
meanwhile
the
theorist
may
have
little
if
any
desultory
memory
unutilizable
facts
may
be
unnoted
by
him
and
forgotten
as
soon
as
heard
an
ignorance
almost
as
encyclopedic
as
his
erudition
may
coexist
with
the
latter
and
hide
as
it
were
within
the
interstices
of
its
web
those
of
you
who
have
had
much
to
do
with
scholars
and
will
readily
think
of
examples
of
the
class
of
mind
i
mean
the
best
possible
sort
of
system
into
which
to
weave
an
object
mentally
is
a
system
or
what
is
called
a
place
the
thing
in
its
in
a
classificatory
series
explain
it
logically
by
its
causes
and
deduce
from
it
its
necessary
effects
find
out
of
what
natural
law
it
is
an
instance
and
you
then
know
it
in
the
best
of
all
possible
ways
a
is
thus
the
greatest
of
contrivances
it
relieves
the
memory
of
an
immense
number
of
details
replacing
as
it
does
merely
contiguous
associations
by
the
logical
ones
of
identity
similarity
or
analogy
if
you
know
a
you
may
discharge
your
memory
of
masses
of
particular
instances
for
the
law
will
reproduce
them
for
you
whenever
you
require
them
the
law
of
refraction
for
example
if
you
know
that
you
can
with
a
pencil
and
a
bit
of
paper
immediately
discern
how
a
convex
lens
a
concave
lens
or
a
prism
must
severally
alter
the
appearance
of
an
object
but
if
you
do
know
the
general
law
you
must
charge
your
memory
separately
with
each
of
the
three
kinds
of
effect
a
system
in
which
all
things
found
their
rational
explanation
and
were
connected
together
as
causes
and
effects
would
be
the
perfect
mnemonic
system
in
which
the
greatest
economy
of
means
would
bring
about
the
greatest
richness
of
results
so
that
if
we
have
poor
desultory
memories
we
can
save
ourselves
by
cultivating
the
philosophic
turn
of
mind
there
are
many
artificial
systems
of
mnemonics
some
public
some
sold
as
secrets
they
are
all
so
many
devices
for
training
us
into
certain
methodical
and
stereotyped
of
about
the
facts
we
seek
to
retain
even
were
i
competent
i
could
not
here
go
into
these
systems
in
any
detail
but
a
single
example
from
a
popular
system
will
show
what
i
mean
i
take
the
the
great
mnemonic
device
for
recollecting
numbers
and
dates
in
this
system
each
digit
is
represented
by
a
consonant
thus
is
or
j
or
k
or
or
or
or
suppose
now
you
wish
to
remember
the
velocity
of
sound
feet
a
second
t
r
are
the
letters
you
must
use
they
make
the
consonants
of
and
it
would
be
a
run
for
you
to
keep
up
such
a
speed
so
the
date
of
the
execution
of
charles
may
be
remembered
by
the
word
which
recalls
the
headsman
axe
apart
from
the
extreme
difficulty
of
finding
words
that
are
appropriate
in
this
exercise
it
is
clearly
an
excessively
poor
trivial
and
silly
way
of
about
dates
and
the
way
of
the
historian
is
much
better
he
has
a
lot
of
already
in
his
mind
he
knows
the
historic
concatenation
of
events
and
can
usually
place
an
event
at
its
right
date
in
the
by
thinking
of
it
in
a
rational
way
referring
it
to
its
antecedents
tracing
its
concomitants
and
consequences
and
thus
ciphering
out
its
date
by
connecting
it
with
theirs
the
artificial
recommending
as
they
do
such
irrational
methods
of
thinking
are
only
to
be
recommended
for
the
first
landmarks
in
a
system
or
for
such
purely
detached
facts
as
enjoy
no
rational
connection
with
the
rest
of
our
ideas
thus
the
student
of
physics
may
remember
the
order
of
the
spectral
colours
by
the
word
which
their
initial
letters
make
the
student
of
anatomy
may
remember
the
position
of
the
mitral
valve
on
the
left
side
of
the
heart
by
thinking
that
stands
also
for
meter
in
the
you
now
see
why
must
be
so
poor
a
mode
of
study
cramming
seeks
to
stamp
things
in
by
intense
application
immediately
before
the
ordeal
but
a
thing
thus
learned
can
form
but
few
associations
on
the
other
hand
the
same
thing
recurring
on
different
days
in
different
contexts
read
recited
on
referred
to
again
and
again
related
to
other
things
and
reviewed
gets
well
wrought
into
the
mental
structure
this
is
the
reason
why
you
should
enforce
on
your
pupils
habits
of
continuous
application
there
is
no
moral
turpitude
in
cramming
it
would
be
the
best
because
the
most
economical
mode
of
study
if
it
led
to
the
results
desired
but
it
does
not
and
your
older
pupils
can
readily
be
made
to
see
the
reason
why
it
follows
also
from
what
has
been
said
that
popular
idea
that
memory
in
the
sense
of
a
general
elementary
faculty
can
be
improved
by
training
is
a
great
your
memory
for
facts
of
a
certain
class
can
be
improved
very
much
by
training
in
that
class
of
facts
because
the
incoming
new
fact
will
then
find
all
sorts
of
analogues
and
associates
already
there
and
these
will
keep
it
liable
to
recall
but
other
kinds
of
fact
will
reap
none
of
that
benefit
and
unless
one
have
been
also
trained
and
versed
in
class
will
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
mere
crude
retentiveness
of
the
individual
which
as
we
have
seen
is
practically
a
fixed
quantity
nevertheless
one
often
hears
people
say
a
great
sin
was
committed
against
me
in
my
youth
my
teachers
entirely
failed
to
exercise
my
memory
if
they
had
only
made
me
learn
a
lot
of
things
by
heart
at
school
i
should
not
be
as
i
am
now
forgetful
of
everything
i
read
and
hear
this
is
a
great
mistake
learning
poetry
by
heart
will
make
it
easier
to
learn
and
remember
other
poetry
but
nothing
else
and
so
of
dates
and
so
of
chemistry
and
geography
but
after
what
i
have
said
i
am
sure
you
will
need
no
farther
argument
on
this
point
and
i
therefore
pass
it
by
but
since
it
has
brought
me
to
speak
of
learning
things
by
heart
i
think
that
a
general
practical
remark
about
verbal
memorizing
may
now
not
be
out
of
place
the
excesses
of
verbal
memorizing
and
the
immense
advantages
of
in
the
earlier
stages
of
culture
have
perhaps
led
those
who
philosophize
about
teaching
to
an
unduly
strong
reaction
and
learning
things
by
heart
is
now
probably
somewhat
too
much
despised
for
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
fact
remains
that
verbal
material
is
on
the
whole
the
handiest
and
most
useful
material
in
which
thinking
can
be
carried
on
abstract
conceptions
are
far
and
away
the
most
economical
instruments
of
thought
and
abstract
conceptions
are
fixed
and
incarnated
for
us
in
words
statistical
inquiry
would
seem
to
show
that
as
men
advance
in
life
they
tend
to
make
less
and
less
use
of
visual
images
and
more
and
more
use
of
words
one
of
the
first
things
that
galton
discovered
was
that
this
appeared
to
be
the
case
with
the
members
of
the
royal
society
whom
he
questioned
as
to
their
mental
images
i
should
say
therefore
that
constant
exercise
in
verbal
memorizing
must
still
be
an
indispensable
feature
in
all
sound
education
nothing
is
more
deplorable
than
that
inarticulate
and
helpless
sort
of
mind
that
is
reminded
by
everything
of
some
quotation
case
or
anecdote
which
it
can
not
now
exactly
recollect
nothing
on
the
other
hand
is
more
convenient
to
its
possessor
or
more
delightful
to
his
comrades
than
a
mind
able
in
telling
a
story
to
give
the
exact
words
of
the
dialogue
or
to
furnish
a
quotation
accurate
and
complete
in
every
branch
of
study
there
are
happily
turned
concise
and
handy
formulas
which
in
an
incomparable
way
sum
up
results
the
mind
that
can
retain
such
formulas
is
in
so
far
a
superior
mind
and
the
communication
of
them
to
the
pupil
ought
always
to
be
one
of
the
teacher
favorite
tasks
in
learning
heart
there
are
however
efficient
and
inefficient
methods
and
by
making
the
pupil
skilful
in
the
best
method
the
teacher
can
both
interest
him
and
abridge
the
task
the
best
method
is
of
course
not
to
in
the
sentences
by
mere
reiteration
but
to
analyze
them
and
think
for
example
if
the
pupil
should
have
to
learn
this
last
sentence
let
him
first
strip
out
its
grammatical
core
and
learn
the
best
method
is
not
to
hammer
in
but
to
analyze
and
then
add
the
amplificative
and
restrictive
clauses
bit
by
bit
thus
the
best
method
is
of
course
not
to
hammer
in
but
to
analyze
and
then
finally
insert
the
words
mere
and
the
sentence
is
complete
and
both
better
understood
and
quicker
remembered
than
by
a
more
purely
mechanical
method
in
conclusion
i
must
say
a
word
about
the
contributions
to
our
knowledge
of
memory
which
have
recently
come
from
the
many
of
the
enthusiasts
for
scientific
or
are
taking
accurate
measurements
of
children
elementary
faculties
and
among
these
what
we
may
call
admits
of
easy
measurement
all
we
need
do
is
to
exhibit
to
the
child
a
series
of
letters
syllables
figures
pictures
or
at
intervals
of
one
two
three
or
more
seconds
or
to
sound
a
similar
series
of
names
at
the
same
intervals
within
his
hearing
and
then
see
how
completely
he
can
reproduce
the
list
either
directly
or
after
an
interval
of
ten
twenty
or
sixty
seconds
or
some
longer
space
of
time
according
to
the
results
of
this
exercise
the
pupils
may
be
rated
in
a
and
some
persons
go
so
far
as
to
think
that
the
teacher
should
modify
her
treatment
of
the
child
according
to
the
strength
or
feebleness
of
its
faculty
as
thus
made
known
now
i
can
only
repeat
here
what
i
said
to
you
when
treating
of
attention
man
is
too
complex
a
being
for
light
to
be
thrown
on
his
real
efficiency
by
measuring
any
one
mental
faculty
taken
apart
from
its
consensus
in
the
working
whole
such
an
exercise
as
this
dealing
with
incoherent
and
insipid
objects
with
no
logical
connection
with
each
other
or
practical
significance
outside
of
the
is
an
exercise
the
like
of
which
in
real
life
we
are
hardly
ever
called
upon
to
perform
in
real
life
our
memory
is
always
used
in
the
service
of
some
interest
we
remember
things
which
we
care
for
or
which
are
associated
with
things
we
care
for
and
the
child
who
stands
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
thus
experimentally
established
might
by
dint
of
the
strength
of
his
passion
for
a
subject
and
in
consequence
of
the
logical
association
into
which
he
weaves
the
actual
materials
of
his
experience
be
a
very
effective
memorizer
indeed
and
do
his
on
the
whole
much
better
than
an
immediate
parrot
who
might
stand
at
the
top
of
the
accurate
list
this
preponderance
of
interest
of
passion
in
determining
the
results
of
a
human
being
working
life
obtains
throughout
no
elementary
measurement
capable
of
being
performed
in
a
laboratory
can
throw
any
light
on
the
actual
efficiency
of
the
subject
for
the
vital
thing
about
him
his
emotional
and
moral
energy
and
doggedness
can
be
measured
by
no
single
experiment
and
becomes
known
only
by
the
total
results
in
the
long
run
a
blind
man
like
huber
with
his
passion
for
bees
and
ants
can
observe
them
through
other
people
eyes
better
than
these
can
through
their
own
a
man
born
with
neither
arms
nor
legs
like
the
late
kavanagh
and
what
an
icy
heart
his
mother
must
have
had
about
him
in
his
babyhood
and
how
would
the
of
his
have
been

be
an
adventurous
traveller
an
equestrian
and
sportsman
and
lead
an
athletic
outdoor
life
romanes
studied
the
elementary
rate
of
apperception
in
a
large
number
of
persons
by
making
them
read
a
paragraph
as
fast
as
they
could
take
it
in
and
then
immediately
write
down
all
they
could
reproduce
of
its
contents
he
found
astonishing
differences
in
the
rapidity
some
taking
four
times
as
long
as
others
to
absorb
the
paragraph
and
the
swiftest
readers
being
as
a
rule
the
best
immediate
recollectors
too
but
not
and
this
is
my
point
the
most
capable
as
tested
by
the
results
of
what
romanes
rightly
names
intellectual
work
for
he
tried
the
experiment
with
several
highly
distinguished
men
in
science
and
literature
and
most
of
them
turned
out
to
be
slow
readers
in
the
light
of
all
such
facts
one
may
well
believe
that
the
total
impression
which
a
perceptive
teacher
will
get
of
the
pupil
condition
as
indicated
by
his
general
temper
and
manner
by
the
listlessness
or
alertness
by
the
ease
or
painfulness
with
which
his
school
work
is
done
will
be
of
much
more
value
than
those
unreal
experimental
tests
those
pedantic
elementary
measurements
of
fatigue
memory
association
and
attention
which
are
urged
upon
us
as
the
only
basis
of
a
genuinely
scientific
pedagogy
such
measurements
can
give
us
useful
information
only
when
we
combine
them
with
observations
made
without
brass
instruments
upon
the
total
demeanor
of
the
measured
individual
by
teachers
with
eyes
in
their
heads
and
common
sense
and
some
feeling
for
the
concrete
facts
of
human
nature
in
their
hearts
depend
upon
it
no
one
need
be
too
much
cast
down
by
the
discovery
of
his
deficiency
in
any
elementary
faculty
of
the
mind
what
tells
in
life
is
the
whole
mind
working
together
and
the
deficiencies
of
any
one
faculty
can
be
compensated
by
the
efforts
of
the
rest
you
can
be
an
artist
without
visual
images
a
reader
without
eyes
a
mass
of
erudition
with
a
bad
elementary
memory
in
almost
any
subject
your
passion
for
the
subject
will
save
you
if
you
only
care
enough
for
a
result
you
will
almost
certainly
attain
it
if
you
wish
to
be
rich
you
will
be
rich
if
you
wish
to
be
learned
you
will
be
learned
if
you
wish
to
be
good
you
will
be
good
only
you
must
then
wish
these
things
and
wish
them
with
exclusiveness
and
not
wish
at
the
same
time
a
hundred
other
incompatible
things
just
as
strongly
one
of
the
most
important
discoveries
of
the
sort
that
have
recently
been
made
in
psychology
is
that
of
galton
and
others
concerning
the
great
variations
among
individuals
in
the
type
of
their
imagination
every
one
is
now
familiar
with
the
fact
that
human
beings
vary
enormously
in
the
brilliancy
completeness
definiteness
and
extent
of
their
visual
images
these
are
singularly
perfect
in
a
large
number
of
individuals
and
in
a
few
are
so
rudimentary
as
hardly
to
exist
the
same
is
true
of
the
auditory
and
motor
images
and
probably
of
those
of
every
kind
and
the
recent
discovery
of
distinct
for
the
various
orders
of
sensation
would
seem
to
provide
a
physical
basis
for
such
variations
and
discrepancies
the
facts
as
i
said
are
nowadays
so
popularly
known
that
i
need
only
remind
you
of
their
existence
they
might
seem
at
first
sight
of
practical
importance
to
the
teacher
and
indeed
teachers
have
been
recommended
to
sort
their
pupils
in
this
way
and
treat
them
as
the
result
falls
out
you
should
interrogate
them
as
to
their
imagery
it
is
said
or
exhibit
lists
of
written
words
to
their
eyes
and
then
sound
similar
lists
in
their
ears
and
see
by
which
channel
a
child
retains
most
words
then
in
dealing
with
that
child
make
your
appeals
predominantly
through
that
channel
if
the
class
were
very
small
results
of
some
distinctness
might
doubtless
thus
be
obtained
by
a
painstaking
teacher
but
it
is
obvious
that
in
the
usual
schoolroom
no
such
differentiation
of
appeal
is
possible
and
the
only
really
useful
practical
lesson
that
emerges
from
this
analytic
psychology
in
the
conduct
of
large
schools
is
the
lesson
already
reached
in
a
purely
empirical
way
that
the
teacher
ought
always
to
impress
the
class
through
as
many
sensible
channels
as
he
can
talk
and
write
and
draw
on
blackboard
permit
the
pupils
to
talk
and
make
them
write
and
draw
exhibit
pictures
plans
and
curves
have
your
diagrams
colored
differently
in
their
different
parts
etc
and
out
of
the
whole
variety
of
impressions
the
individual
child
will
find
the
most
lasting
ones
for
himself
in
all
primary
school
work
this
principle
of
multiple
impressions
is
well
recognized
so
i
need
say
no
more
about
it
here
this
principle
of
multiplying
channels
and
varying
associations
and
appeals
is
important
not
only
for
teaching
pupils
to
remember
but
for
teaching
them
to
understand
it
runs
in
fact
through
the
whole
teaching
art
one
word
about
the
unconscious
and
unreproducible
part
of
our
acquisitions
and
i
shall
have
done
with
the
topic
of
memory
professor
ebbinghaus
in
a
heroic
little
investigation
into
the
laws
of
memory
which
he
performed
a
dozen
or
more
years
ago
by
the
method
of
learning
lists
of
nonsense
syllables
devised
a
method
of
measuring
the
rate
of
our
forgetfulness
which
lays
bare
an
important
law
of
the
mind
his
method
was
to
read
over
his
list
until
he
could
repeat
it
once
by
heart
unhesitatingly
the
number
of
repetitions
required
for
this
was
a
measure
of
the
difficulty
of
the
learning
in
each
particular
case
now
after
having
once
learned
a
piece
in
this
way
if
we
wait
five
minutes
we
find
it
impossible
to
repeat
it
again
in
the
same
unhesitating
manner
we
must
read
it
over
again
to
revive
some
of
the
syllables
which
have
already
dropped
out
or
got
transposed
ebbinghaus
now
systematically
studied
the
number
of
which
were
necessary
to
revive
the
unhesitating
recollection
of
the
piece
after
five
minutes
half
an
hour
an
hour
a
day
a
week
a
month
had
elapsed
the
number
of
rereadings
required
he
took
to
be
a
measure
of
the
of
that
had
occurred
in
the
elapsed
interval
and
he
found
some
remarkable
facts
the
process
of
forgetting
namely
is
vastly
more
rapid
at
first
than
later
on
thus
full
half
of
the
piece
seems
to
be
forgotten
within
the
first
of
it
are
forgotten
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
but
only
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
made
no
trials
beyond
one
month
of
interval
but
if
we
ourselves
prolong
ideally
the
curve
of
remembrance
whose
beginning
his
experiments
thus
obtain
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
no
matter
how
long
a
time
might
elapse
the
curve
would
never
descend
quite
so
low
as
to
touch
the
in
other
words
no
matter
how
long
ago
we
may
have
learned
a
poem
and
no
matter
how
complete
our
inability
to
reproduce
it
now
may
be
yet
the
first
learning
will
still
show
its
lingering
effects
in
the
abridgment
of
the
time
required
for
learning
it
again
in
short
professor
ebbinghaus
experiments
show
that
things
which
we
are
quite
unable
definitely
to
recall
have
nevertheless
impressed
themselves
in
some
way
upon
the
structure
of
the
mind
we
are
different
for
having
once
learned
them
the
resistances
in
our
systems
of
are
altered
our
apprehensions
are
quickened
our
conclusions
from
certain
premises
are
probably
not
just
what
they
would
be
if
those
modifications
were
not
there
the
latter
influence
the
whole
margin
of
our
consciousness
even
though
their
products
not
being
distinctly
reproducible
do
not
directly
figure
at
the
focus
of
the
field
the
teacher
should
draw
a
lesson
from
these
facts
we
are
all
too
apt
to
measure
the
gains
of
our
pupils
by
their
proficiency
in
directly
reproducing
in
a
recitation
or
an
examination
such
matters
as
they
may
have
learned
and
inarticulate
power
in
them
is
something
of
which
we
always
underestimate
the
value
the
boy
who
tells
us
i
know
the
answer
but
i
ca
say
what
it
is
we
treat
as
practically
identical
with
him
who
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
the
answer
at
all
but
this
is
a
great
mistake
it
is
but
a
small
part
of
our
experience
in
life
that
we
are
ever
able
articulately
to
recall
and
yet
the
whole
of
it
has
had
its
influence
in
shaping
our
character
and
defining
our
tendencies
to
judge
and
act
although
the
ready
memory
is
a
great
blessing
to
its
possessor
the
vaguer
memory
of
a
subject
of
having
once
had
to
do
with
it
of
its
neighborhood
and
of
where
we
may
go
to
recover
it
again
constitutes
in
most
men
and
women
the
chief
fruit
of
their
education
this
is
true
even
in
professional
education
the
doctor
the
lawyer
are
seldom
able
to
decide
upon
a
case
they
differ
from
other
men
only
through
the
fact
that
they
know
how
to
get
at
the
materials
for
decision
in
five
minutes
or
half
an
hour
whereas
the
layman
is
unable
to
get
at
the
materials
at
all
not
knowing
in
what
books
and
indexes
to
look
or
not
understanding
the
technical
terms
be
patient
then
and
sympathetic
with
the
type
of
mind
that
cuts
a
poor
figure
in
examinations
it
may
in
the
long
examination
which
life
sets
us
come
out
in
the
end
in
better
shape
than
the
glib
and
ready
reproducer
its
passions
being
deeper
its
purposes
more
worthy
its
combining
power
less
commonplace
and
its
total
mental
output
consequently
more
important
such
are
the
chief
points
which
it
has
seemed
worth
while
for
me
to
call
to
your
notice
under
the
head
of
memory
we
can
sum
them
up
for
practical
purposes
by
saying
that
the
art
of
remembering
is
the
art
of
and
by
adding
with
dr
pick
that
when
we
wish
to
fix
a
new
thing
in
either
our
own
mind
or
a
pupil
our
conscious
effort
should
not
be
so
much
to
and
it
as
to
it
with
something
else
already
there
the
connecting
the
thinking
and
if
we
attend
clearly
to
the
connection
the
connected
thing
will
certainly
be
likely
to
remain
within
recall
i
shall
next
ask
you
to
consider
the
process
by
which
we
acquire
new
knowledge
the
process
of
as
it
is
called
by
which
we
receive
and
deal
with
new
experiences
and
revise
our
stock
of
ideas
so
as
to
form
new
or
improved
conceptions
xiii
the
acquisition
of
ideas
the
images
of
our
past
experiences
of
whatever
nature
they
may
be
visual
or
verbal
blurred
and
dim
vivid
and
distinct
abstract
or
concrete
need
not
be
memory
images
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
that
is
they
need
not
rise
before
the
mind
in
a
marginal
fringe
or
context
of
concomitant
circumstances
which
mean
for
us
their
they
may
be
mere
conceptions
floating
pictures
of
an
object
or
of
its
type
or
class
in
this
undated
condition
we
call
them
products
of
or
imagination
is
the
term
commonly
used
where
the
object
represented
is
thought
of
as
an
individual
thing
conception
is
the
term
where
we
think
of
it
as
a
type
or
class
for
our
present
purpose
the
distinction
is
not
important
and
i
will
permit
myself
to
use
either
the
word
or
the
still
vaguer
word
to
designate
the
inner
objects
of
contemplation
whether
these
be
individual
things
like
sun
or
cæsar
or
classes
of
things
like
kingdom
or
finally
entirely
abstract
attributes
like
or
the
result
of
our
education
is
to
fill
the
mind
little
by
little
as
experiences
accrete
with
a
stock
of
such
ideas
in
the
illustration
i
used
at
our
first
meeting
of
the
child
snatching
the
toy
and
getting
slapped
the
vestiges
left
by
the
first
experience
answered
to
so
many
ideas
which
he
acquired
thereby
ideas
that
remained
with
him
associated
in
a
certain
order
and
from
the
last
one
of
which
the
child
eventually
proceeded
to
act
the
sciences
of
grammar
and
of
logic
are
little
more
than
attempts
methodically
to
classify
all
such
acquired
ideas
and
to
trace
certain
laws
of
relationship
among
them
the
forms
of
relation
between
them
becoming
themselves
in
turn
noticed
by
the
mind
are
treated
as
conceptions
of
a
higher
and
more
abstract
order
as
when
we
speak
of
a
syllogistic
relation
between
propositions
or
of
four
quantities
making
a
or
of
the
of
two
conceptions
or
the
of
one
in
the
other
so
you
see
that
the
process
of
education
taken
in
a
large
way
may
be
described
as
nothing
but
the
process
of
acquiring
ideas
or
conceptions
the
best
educated
mind
being
the
mind
which
has
the
largest
stock
of
them
ready
to
meet
the
largest
possible
variety
of
the
emergencies
of
life
the
lack
of
education
means
only
the
failure
to
have
acquired
them
and
the
consequent
liability
to
be
and
in
the
vicissitudes
of
experience
in
all
this
process
of
acquiring
conceptions
a
certain
instinctive
order
is
followed
there
is
a
native
tendency
to
assimilate
certain
kinds
of
conception
at
one
age
and
other
kinds
of
conception
at
a
later
age
during
the
first
seven
or
eight
years
of
childhood
the
mind
is
most
interested
in
the
sensible
properties
of
material
things
is
the
instinct
most
active
and
by
the
incessant
hammering
and
sawing
and
dressing
and
undressing
dolls
putting
of
things
together
and
taking
them
apart
the
child
not
only
trains
the
muscles
to
action
but
accumulates
a
store
of
physical
conceptions
which
are
the
basis
of
his
knowledge
of
the
material
world
through
life
and
manual
training
wisely
extend
the
sphere
of
this
order
of
acquisition
clay
wood
metals
and
the
various
kinds
of
tools
are
made
to
contribute
to
the
store
a
youth
brought
up
with
a
sufficiently
broad
basis
of
this
kind
is
always
at
home
in
the
world
he
stands
within
the
pale
he
is
acquainted
with
nature
and
nature
in
a
certain
sense
is
acquainted
with
him
whereas
the
youth
brought
up
alone
at
home
with
no
acquaintance
with
anything
but
the
printed
page
is
always
afflicted
with
a
certain
remoteness
from
the
material
facts
of
life
and
a
correlative
insecurity
of
consciousness
which
make
of
him
a
kind
of
alien
on
the
earth
in
which
he
ought
to
feel
himself
perfectly
at
home
i
already
said
something
of
this
in
speaking
of
the
constructive
impulse
and
i
must
not
repeat
myself
moreover
you
fully
realize
i
am
sure
how
important
for
life
for
the
moral
tone
of
life
quite
apart
from
definite
practical
pursuits
is
this
sense
of
readiness
for
emergencies
which
a
man
gains
through
early
familiarity
and
acquaintance
with
the
world
of
material
things
to
have
grown
up
on
a
farm
to
have
haunted
a
carpenter
and
blacksmith
shop
to
have
handled
horses
and
cows
and
boats
and
guns
and
to
have
ideas
and
abilities
connected
with
such
objects
are
an
inestimable
part
of
youthful
acquisition
after
adolescence
it
is
rare
to
be
able
to
get
into
familiar
touch
with
any
of
these
primitive
things
the
instinctive
propensions
have
faded
and
the
habits
are
hard
to
acquire
accordingly
one
of
the
best
fruits
of
the
movement
has
been
to
reinstate
all
these
activities
to
their
proper
place
in
a
sound
system
of
education
the
growing
human
being
feed
him
with
the
sort
of
experience
for
which
from
year
to
year
he
shows
a
natural
craving
and
he
will
develop
in
adult
life
a
sounder
sort
of
mental
tissue
even
though
he
may
seem
to
be
a
great
deal
of
his
growing
time
in
the
eyes
of
those
for
whom
the
only
channels
of
learning
are
books
and
verbally
communicated
information
it
is
not
till
adolescence
is
reached
that
the
mind
grows
able
to
take
in
the
more
abstract
aspects
of
experience
the
hidden
similarities
and
distinctions
between
things
and
especially
their
causal
sequences
rational
knowledge
of
such
things
as
mathematics
mechanics
chemistry
and
biology
is
now
possible
and
the
acquisition
of
conceptions
of
this
order
form
the
next
phase
of
education
later
still
not
till
adolescence
is
well
advanced
does
the
mind
awaken
to
a
systematic
interest
in
abstract
human
relations
moral
relations
properly
so
called
to
sociological
ideas
and
to
metaphysical
abstractions
this
general
order
of
sequence
is
followed
traditionally
of
course
in
the
schoolroom
it
is
foreign
to
my
purpose
to
do
more
than
indicate
that
general
psychological
principle
of
the
successive
order
of
awakening
of
the
faculties
on
which
the
whole
thing
rests
i
have
spoken
of
it
already
apropos
of
the
transitoriness
of
instincts
just
as
many
a
youth
has
to
go
permanently
without
an
adequate
stock
of
conceptions
of
a
certain
order
because
experiences
of
that
order
were
not
yielded
at
the
time
when
new
curiosity
was
most
acute
so
it
will
conversely
happen
that
many
another
youth
is
spoiled
for
a
certain
subject
of
study
although
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
well
if
led
into
it
at
a
later
age
through
having
had
it
thrust
upon
him
so
prematurely
that
disgust
was
created
and
the
bloom
quite
taken
off
from
future
trials
i
think
i
have
seen
college
students
unfitted
forever
for
from
having
taken
that
study
up
a
year
too
soon
in
all
these
later
studies
verbal
material
is
the
vehicle
by
which
the
mind
thinks
the
abstract
conceptions
of
physics
and
sociology
may
it
is
true
be
embodied
in
visual
or
other
images
of
phenomena
but
they
need
not
be
so
and
the
truth
remains
that
after
adolescence
has
begun
words
words
words
must
constitute
a
large
part
and
an
always
larger
part
as
life
advances
of
what
the
human
being
has
to
learn
this
is
so
even
in
the
natural
sciences
so
far
as
these
are
causal
and
rational
and
not
merely
confined
to
description
so
i
go
back
to
what
i
said
awhile
ago
apropos
of
verbal
memorizing
the
more
accurately
words
are
learned
the
better
if
only
the
teacher
make
sure
that
what
they
signify
is
also
understood
it
is
the
failure
of
this
latter
condition
in
so
much
of
the
recitation
that
has
caused
that
reaction
against
reproduction
that
we
are
so
familiar
with
a
friend
of
mine
visiting
a
school
was
asked
to
examine
a
young
class
in
geography
glancing
at
the
book
she
said
suppose
you
should
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
hundreds
of
feet
deep
how
should
you
find
it
at
the
bottom
warmer
or
colder
than
on
top
none
of
the
class
replying
the
teacher
said
i
sure
they
know
but
i
think
you
ask
the
question
quite
rightly
let
me
try
so
taking
the
book
she
asked
in
what
condition
is
the
interior
of
the
globe
and
received
the
immediate
answer
from
half
the
class
at
once
the
interior
of
the
globe
is
in
a
condition
of
better
exclusive
than
such
verbal
recitations
as
that
and
yet
verbal
reproduction
intelligently
connected
with
more
objective
work
must
always
play
a
leading
and
surely
leading
part
in
education
our
modern
reformers
in
their
books
write
too
exclusively
of
the
earliest
years
of
the
pupil
these
lend
themselves
better
to
explicit
treatment
and
i
myself
in
dwelling
so
much
upon
the
native
impulses
and
and
anecdotes
and
all
that
have
paid
my
tribute
to
the
line
of
least
resistance
in
describing
yet
away
back
in
childhood
we
find
the
beginnings
of
purely
intellectual
curiosity
and
the
intelligence
of
abstract
terms
the
is
mainly
to
the
pupils
with
some
concrete
conceptions
of
the
facts
concerned
upon
the
more
abstract
ideas
to
hear
some
authorities
on
teaching
however
you
would
suppose
that
geography
not
only
began
but
ended
with
the
and
neighboring
hill
that
physics
was
one
endless
round
of
repeating
the
same
sort
of
tedious
weighing
and
measuring
operation
whereas
a
very
few
examples
are
usually
sufficient
to
set
the
imagination
free
on
genuine
lines
and
then
what
the
mind
craves
is
more
rapid
general
and
abstract
treatment
i
heard
a
lady
say
that
she
had
taken
her
child
to
the
kindergarten
but
he
is
so
bright
that
he
saw
through
it
immediately
too
many
school
children
as
immediately
the
attempts
of
the
softer
pedagogy
to
lubricate
things
for
them
and
make
them
interesting
even
they
can
enjoy
abstractions
provided
they
be
of
the
proper
order
and
it
is
a
poor
compliment
to
their
rational
appetite
to
think
that
anecdotes
about
little
tommies
and
little
jennies
are
the
only
kind
of
things
their
minds
can
digest
but
here
as
elsewhere
it
is
a
matter
of
more
or
less
and
in
the
last
resort
the
teacher
own
tact
is
the
only
thing
that
can
bring
out
the
right
effect
the
great
difficulty
with
abstractions
is
that
of
knowing
just
what
meaning
the
pupil
attaches
to
the
terms
he
uses
the
words
may
sound
all
right
but
the
meaning
remains
the
child
own
secret
so
varied
forms
of
words
must
be
insisted
on
to
bring
the
secret
out
and
a
strange
secret
does
it
often
prove
a
relative
of
mine
was
trying
to
explain
to
a
little
girl
what
was
meant
by
passive
voice
suppose
that
you
kill
me
you
who
do
the
killing
are
in
the
active
voice
and
i
who
am
killed
am
in
the
passive
voice
but
how
can
you
speak
if
you
killed
said
the
child
oh
well
you
may
suppose
that
i
am
not
yet
quite
dead
the
next
day
the
child
was
asked
in
class
to
explain
the
passive
voice
and
said
it
the
kind
of
voice
you
speak
with
when
you
ai
quite
dead
in
such
a
case
as
this
the
illustration
ought
to
have
been
more
varied
every
one
memory
will
probably
furnish
examples
of
the
fantastic
meaning
which
their
childhood
attached
to
certain
verbal
statements
in
poetry
often
and
which
their
elders
not
having
any
reason
to
suspect
never
corrected
i
remember
being
greatly
moved
emotionally
at
the
age
of
eight
by
the
ballad
of
lord
ullin
daughter
yet
i
thought
that
the
staining
of
the
heather
by
the
blood
was
the
evil
chiefly
dreaded
and
that
when
the
boatman
said
i
row
you
the
ferry
it
is
not
for
your
silver
bright
but
for
your
winsome
lady
he
was
to
receive
the
lady
for
his
pay
similarly
i
recently
found
that
one
of
my
own
children
was
reading
and
accepting
a
verse
of
in
memoriam
as
ring
out
the
of
rich
and
poor
ring
in
to
all
mankind
and
finding
no
inward
difficulty
the
only
safeguard
against
this
sort
of
misconceiving
is
to
insist
on
varied
statement
and
to
bring
the
child
conceptions
wherever
it
be
possible
to
some
sort
of
practical
test
let
us
next
pass
to
the
subject
of
apperception
xiv
apperception
is
a
word
which
cuts
a
great
figure
in
the
pedagogics
of
the
present
day
read
for
example
this
advertisement
of
a
certain
which
i
take
from
an
educational
journal
what
is
apperception
for
an
explanation
of
apperception
see
blank
psychology
vol
of
the
education
series
just
published
the
difference
between
perception
and
apperception
is
explained
for
the
teacher
in
the
preface
to
psychology
many
teachers
are
inquiring
what
is
the
meaning
of
apperception
in
educational
psychology
just
the
book
for
them
is
blank
psychology
in
which
the
idea
was
first
expounded
the
most
important
idea
in
educational
psychology
is
apperception
the
teacher
may
find
this
expounded
in
psychology
the
idea
of
apperception
is
making
a
revolution
in
educational
methods
in
germany
it
is
explained
in
psychology
vol
of
the
education
series
just
published
blank
psychology
will
be
mailed
prepaid
to
any
address
on
receipt
of
such
an
advertisement
is
in
sober
earnest
a
disgrace
to
all
concerned
and
such
talk
as
it
indulges
in
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
had
in
view
when
i
said
at
our
first
meeting
that
the
teachers
were
suffering
at
the
present
day
from
a
certain
industrious
mystification
on
the
part
of
editors
and
publishers
perhaps
the
word
flourished
in
their
eyes
and
ears
as
it
nowadays
often
is
embodies
as
much
of
this
mystification
as
any
other
single
thing
the
conscientious
young
teacher
is
led
to
believe
that
it
contains
a
recondite
and
portentous
secret
by
losing
the
true
inwardness
of
which
her
whole
career
may
be
shattered
and
yet
when
she
turns
to
the
books
and
reads
about
it
it
seems
so
trivial
and
commonplace
a
matter
meaning
nothing
more
than
the
manner
in
which
we
receive
a
thing
into
our
minds
that
she
fears
she
must
have
missed
the
point
through
the
shallowness
of
her
intelligence
and
goes
about
thereafter
afflicted
with
a
sense
either
of
uncertainty
or
of
stupidity
and
in
each
case
remaining
mortified
at
being
so
inadequate
to
her
mission
now
apperception
is
an
extremely
useful
word
in
pedagogics
and
offers
a
convenient
name
for
a
process
to
which
every
teacher
must
frequently
refer
but
it
verily
means
nothing
more
than
the
act
of
taking
a
thing
into
the
mind
it
corresponds
to
nothing
peculiar
or
elementary
in
psychology
being
only
one
of
the
innumerable
results
of
the
psychological
process
of
association
of
ideas
and
psychology
itself
can
easily
dispense
with
the
word
useful
as
it
may
be
in
pedagogics
the
gist
of
the
matter
is
this
every
impression
that
comes
in
from
without
be
it
a
sentence
which
we
hear
an
object
of
vision
or
an
effluvium
which
assails
our
nose
no
sooner
enters
our
consciousness
than
it
is
drafted
off
in
some
determinate
direction
or
other
making
connection
with
the
other
materials
already
there
and
finally
producing
what
we
call
our
reaction
the
particular
connections
it
strikes
into
are
determined
by
our
past
experiences
and
the
of
the
present
sort
of
impression
with
them
if
for
instance
you
hear
me
call
out
a
b
c
it
is
ten
to
one
that
you
will
react
on
the
impression
by
inwardly
or
outwardly
articulating
d
e
the
impression
arouses
its
old
associates
they
go
out
to
meet
it
it
is
received
by
them
recognized
by
the
mind
as
beginning
of
the
alphabet
it
is
the
fate
of
every
impression
thus
to
fall
into
a
mind
preoccupied
with
memories
ideas
and
interests
and
by
these
it
is
taken
in
educated
as
we
already
are
we
never
get
an
experience
that
remains
for
us
completely
nondescript
it
always
of
something
similar
in
quality
or
of
some
context
that
might
have
surrounded
it
before
and
which
it
now
in
some
way
suggests
this
mental
escort
which
the
mind
supplies
is
drawn
of
course
from
the
mind
stock
we
the
impression
in
some
definite
way
we
dispose
of
it
according
to
our
acquired
possibilities
be
they
few
or
many
in
the
way
of
this
way
of
taking
in
the
object
is
the
process
of
apperception
the
conceptions
which
meet
and
assimilate
it
are
called
by
herbart
the
mass
the
apperceived
impression
is
engulfed
in
this
and
the
result
is
a
new
field
of
consciousness
of
which
one
part
and
often
a
very
small
part
comes
from
the
outer
world
and
another
part
sometimes
by
far
the
largest
comes
from
the
previous
contents
of
the
mind
i
think
that
you
see
plainly
enough
now
that
the
process
of
apperception
is
what
i
called
it
a
moment
ago
a
resultant
of
the
association
of
ideas
the
product
is
a
sort
of
fusion
of
the
new
with
the
old
in
which
it
is
often
impossible
to
distinguish
the
share
of
the
two
factors
for
example
when
we
listen
to
a
person
speaking
or
read
a
page
of
print
much
of
what
we
think
we
see
or
hear
is
supplied
from
our
memory
we
overlook
misprints
imagining
the
right
letters
though
we
see
the
wrong
ones
and
how
little
we
actually
hear
when
we
listen
to
speech
we
realize
when
we
go
to
a
foreign
theatre
for
there
what
troubles
us
is
not
so
much
that
we
can
not
understand
what
the
actors
say
as
that
we
can
not
hear
their
words
the
fact
is
that
we
hear
quite
as
little
under
similar
conditions
at
home
only
our
mind
being
fuller
of
english
verbal
associations
supplies
the
requisite
material
for
comprehension
upon
a
much
slighter
auditory
hint
in
all
the
apperceptive
operations
of
the
mind
a
certain
general
law
makes
itself
felt
the
law
of
economy
in
admitting
a
new
body
of
experience
we
instinctively
seek
to
disturb
as
little
as
possible
our
stock
of
ideas
we
always
try
to
name
a
new
experience
in
some
way
which
will
assimilate
it
to
what
we
already
know
we
hate
anything
new
anything
without
any
name
and
for
which
a
new
name
must
be
forged
so
we
take
the
nearest
name
even
though
it
be
inappropriate
a
child
will
call
snow
when
he
sees
it
for
the
first
time
sugar
or
white
butterflies
the
sail
of
a
boat
he
calls
a
curtain
an
egg
in
its
shell
seen
for
the
first
time
he
calls
a
pretty
potato
an
orange
a
ball
a
folding
corkscrew
a
pair
of
bad
scissors
caspar
hauser
called
the
first
geese
he
saw
horses
and
the
polynesians
called
captain
cook
horses
pigs
rooper
has
written
a
little
book
on
apperception
to
which
he
gives
the
title
of
a
pot
of
green
feathers
that
being
the
name
applied
to
a
pot
of
ferns
by
a
child
who
had
never
seen
ferns
before
in
later
life
this
economical
tendency
to
leave
the
old
undisturbed
leads
to
what
we
know
as
fogyism
a
new
idea
or
a
fact
which
would
entail
extensive
rearrangement
of
the
previous
system
of
beliefs
is
always
ignored
or
extruded
from
the
mind
in
case
it
can
not
be
sophistically
reinterpreted
so
as
to
tally
harmoniously
with
the
system
we
have
all
conducted
discussions
with
people
overpowered
them
with
our
reasons
forced
them
to
admit
our
contention
and
a
week
later
found
them
back
as
secure
and
constant
in
their
old
opinion
as
if
they
had
never
conversed
with
us
at
all
we
call
them
old
fogies
but
there
are
young
fogies
too
old
fogyism
begins
at
a
younger
age
than
we
think
i
am
almost
afraid
to
say
so
but
i
believe
that
in
the
majority
of
human
beings
it
begins
at
about
in
some
of
the
books
we
find
the
various
forms
of
apperception
codified
and
their
subdivisions
numbered
and
ticketed
in
tabular
form
in
the
way
so
delightful
to
the
pedagogic
eye
in
one
book
which
i
remember
reading
there
were
sixteen
different
types
of
apperception
discriminated
from
each
other
there
was
associative
apperception
subsumptive
apperception
assimilative
apperception
and
others
up
to
sixteen
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
is
nothing
but
an
exhibition
of
the
crass
artificiality
which
has
always
haunted
psychology
and
which
perpetuates
itself
by
lingering
along
especially
in
these
works
which
are
advertised
as
for
the
use
of
teachers
the
flowing
life
of
the
mind
is
sorted
into
parcels
suitable
for
presentation
in
the
and
chopped
up
into
supposed
with
long
greek
and
latin
names
which
in
real
life
have
no
distinct
existence
there
is
no
reason
if
we
are
classing
the
different
types
of
apperception
why
we
should
stop
at
sixteen
rather
than
sixteen
hundred
there
are
as
many
types
of
apperception
as
there
are
possible
ways
in
which
an
incoming
experience
may
be
reacted
on
by
an
individual
mind
a
little
while
ago
at
buffalo
i
was
the
guest
of
a
lady
who
a
fortnight
before
had
taken
her
boy
for
the
first
time
to
niagara
falls
the
child
silently
glared
at
the
phenomenon
until
his
mother
supposing
him
struck
speechless
by
its
sublimity
said
well
my
boy
what
do
you
think
of
it
to
which
is
that
the
kind
of
spray
i
spray
my
nose
with
was
the
boy
only
reply
that
was
his
mode
of
apperceiving
the
spectacle
you
may
claim
this
as
a
particular
type
and
call
it
by
the
greek
name
of
rhinotherapeutical
apperception
if
you
like
and
if
you
do
you
will
hardly
be
more
trivial
or
artificial
than
are
some
of
the
authors
of
the
books
perez
in
one
of
his
books
on
childhood
gives
a
good
example
of
the
different
modes
of
apperception
of
the
same
phenomenon
which
are
possible
at
different
stages
of
individual
experience
a
took
fire
and
an
infant
in
the
family
witnessing
the
conflagration
from
the
arms
of
his
nurse
standing
outside
expressed
nothing
but
the
liveliest
delight
at
its
brilliancy
but
when
the
bell
of
the
fire
engine
was
heard
approaching
the
child
was
thrown
by
the
sound
into
a
paroxysm
of
fear
strange
sounds
being
as
you
know
very
alarming
to
young
children
in
what
opposite
ways
must
the
child
parents
have
apperceived
the
burning
house
and
the
engine
respectively
the
person
according
to
the
line
of
thought
he
may
be
in
or
to
his
emotional
mood
will
apperceive
the
same
impression
quite
differently
on
different
occasions
a
medical
or
engineering
expert
retained
on
one
side
of
a
case
will
not
apperceive
the
facts
in
the
same
way
as
if
the
other
side
had
retained
him
when
people
are
at
loggerheads
about
the
interpretation
of
a
fact
it
usually
shows
that
they
have
too
few
heads
of
classification
to
apperceive
by
for
as
a
general
thing
the
fact
of
such
a
dispute
is
enough
to
show
that
neither
one
of
their
rival
interpretations
is
a
perfect
fit
both
sides
deal
with
the
matter
by
approximation
squeezing
it
under
the
handiest
or
least
disturbing
conception
whereas
it
would
nine
times
out
of
ten
be
better
to
enlarge
their
stock
of
ideas
or
invent
some
altogether
new
title
for
the
phenomenon
thus
in
biology
we
used
to
have
interminable
discussion
as
to
whether
certain
organisms
were
animals
or
vegetables
until
haeckel
introduced
the
new
apperceptive
name
of
protista
which
ended
the
disputes
in
law
courts
no
is
recognized
between
insanity
and
sanity
if
sane
a
man
is
punished
if
insane
acquitted
and
it
is
seldom
hard
to
find
two
experts
who
will
take
opposite
views
of
his
case
all
the
while
nature
is
more
subtle
than
our
doctors
just
as
a
room
is
neither
dark
nor
light
absolutely
but
might
be
dark
for
a
watchmaker
uses
and
yet
light
enough
to
eat
in
or
play
in
so
a
man
may
be
sane
for
some
purposes
and
insane
for
others
sane
enough
to
be
left
at
large
yet
not
sane
enough
to
take
care
of
his
financial
affairs
the
word
which
became
familiar
at
the
time
of
guiteau
trial
fulfilled
the
need
of
a
the
foreign
terms
degenerate
and
subject
have
arisen
in
response
to
the
same
need
the
whole
progress
of
our
sciences
goes
on
by
the
invention
of
newly
forged
technical
names
whereby
to
designate
the
newly
remarked
aspects
of
phenomena
phenomena
which
could
only
be
squeezed
with
violence
into
the
pigeonholes
of
the
earlier
stock
of
conceptions
as
time
goes
on
our
vocabulary
becomes
thus
ever
more
and
more
voluminous
having
to
keep
up
with
the
multitude
of
our
stock
of
apperceiving
ideas
in
this
gradual
process
of
interaction
between
the
new
and
the
old
not
only
is
the
new
modified
and
determined
by
the
particular
sort
of
old
which
apperceives
it
but
the
apperceiving
mass
the
old
itself
is
modified
by
the
particular
kind
of
new
which
it
assimilates
thus
to
take
the
stock
german
example
of
the
child
brought
up
in
a
house
where
there
are
no
tables
but
square
ones
means
for
him
a
thing
in
which
square
corners
are
essential
but
if
he
goes
to
a
house
where
there
are
round
tables
and
still
calls
them
tables
his
apperceiving
notion
acquires
immediately
a
wider
inward
content
in
this
way
our
conceptions
are
constantly
dropping
characters
once
supposed
essential
and
including
others
once
supposed
inadmissible
the
extension
of
the
notion
to
porpoises
and
whales
of
the
notion
to
society
are
familiar
examples
of
what
i
mean
but
be
our
conceptions
adequate
or
inadequate
and
be
our
stock
of
them
large
or
small
they
are
all
we
have
to
work
with
if
an
educated
man
is
as
i
said
a
group
of
organized
tendencies
to
conduct
what
prompts
the
conduct
is
in
every
case
the
man
conception
of
the
way
in
which
to
name
and
classify
the
actual
emergency
the
more
adequate
the
stock
of
ideas
the
more
is
the
man
the
more
uniformly
appropriate
is
his
behavior
likely
to
be
when
later
we
take
up
the
subject
of
the
will
we
shall
see
that
the
essential
preliminary
to
every
decision
is
the
finding
of
the
right
under
which
to
class
the
proposed
alternatives
of
conduct
he
who
has
few
names
is
in
so
far
forth
an
incompetent
deliberator
the
names
and
each
name
stands
for
a
conception
or
idea
are
our
instruments
for
handling
our
problems
and
solving
our
dilemmas
now
when
we
think
of
this
we
are
too
apt
to
forget
an
important
fact
which
is
that
in
most
human
beings
the
stock
of
names
and
concepts
is
mostly
acquired
during
the
years
of
adolescence
and
the
earliest
years
of
adult
life
i
probably
shocked
you
a
moment
ago
by
saying
that
most
men
begin
to
be
old
fogies
at
the
age
of
it
is
true
that
a
adult
keeps
gaining
well
into
middle
age
a
great
knowledge
of
details
and
a
great
acquaintance
with
individual
cases
connected
with
his
profession
or
business
life
in
this
sense
his
conceptions
increase
during
a
very
long
period
for
his
knowledge
grows
more
extensive
and
minute
but
the
larger
categories
of
conception
the
sorts
of
thing
and
wider
classes
of
relation
between
things
of
which
we
take
cognizance
are
all
got
into
the
mind
at
a
comparatively
youthful
date
few
men
ever
do
acquaint
themselves
with
the
principles
of
a
new
science
after
even
if
you
do
not
study
political
economy
in
college
it
is
a
thousand
to
one
that
its
main
conceptions
will
remain
unknown
to
you
through
life
similarly
with
biology
similarly
with
electricity
what
percentage
of
persons
now
fifty
years
old
have
any
definite
conception
whatever
of
a
dynamo
or
how
the
are
made
to
run
surely
a
small
fraction
of
one
per
cent
but
the
boys
in
colleges
are
all
acquiring
these
conceptions
there
is
a
sense
of
infinite
potentiality
in
us
all
when
young
which
makes
some
of
us
draw
up
lists
of
books
we
intend
to
read
hereafter
and
makes
most
of
us
think
that
we
can
easily
acquaint
ourselves
with
all
sorts
of
things
which
we
are
now
neglecting
by
studying
them
out
hereafter
in
the
intervals
of
leisure
of
our
business
lives
such
good
intentions
are
hardly
ever
carried
out
the
conceptions
acquired
before
thirty
remain
usually
the
only
ones
we
ever
gain
such
exceptional
cases
of
perpetually
youth
as
gladstone
only
prove
by
the
admiration
they
awaken
the
universality
of
the
rule
and
it
may
well
solemnize
a
teacher
and
confirm
in
him
a
healthy
sense
of
the
importance
of
his
mission
to
feel
how
exclusively
dependent
upon
his
present
ministrations
in
the
way
of
imparting
conceptions
the
future
life
is
probably
bound
to
be
xv
the
will
since
mentality
terminates
naturally
in
outward
conduct
the
final
chapter
in
psychology
has
to
be
the
chapter
on
the
will
but
the
word
can
be
used
in
a
broader
and
in
a
narrower
sense
in
the
broader
sense
it
designates
our
entire
capacity
for
impulsive
and
active
life
including
our
instinctive
reactions
and
those
forms
of
behavior
that
have
become
secondarily
automatic
and
through
frequent
repetition
in
the
narrower
sense
acts
of
will
are
such
acts
only
as
can
not
be
inattentively
performed
a
distinct
idea
of
what
they
are
and
a
deliberate
on
the
mind
part
must
precede
their
execution
such
acts
are
often
characterized
by
hesitation
and
accompanied
by
a
feeling
altogether
peculiar
of
resolve
a
feeling
which
may
or
may
not
carry
with
it
a
further
feeling
of
effort
in
my
earlier
talks
i
said
so
much
of
our
impulsive
tendencies
that
i
will
restrict
myself
in
what
follows
to
volition
in
this
narrower
sense
of
the
term
all
our
deeds
were
considered
by
the
early
psychologists
to
be
due
to
a
peculiar
faculty
called
the
will
without
whose
fiat
action
could
not
occur
thoughts
and
impressions
being
intrinsically
inactive
were
supposed
to
produce
conduct
only
through
the
intermediation
of
this
superior
agent
until
they
twitched
its
so
to
speak
no
outward
behavior
could
occur
this
doctrine
was
long
ago
exploded
by
the
discovery
of
the
phenomena
of
reflex
action
in
which
sensible
impressions
as
you
know
produce
movement
immediately
and
of
themselves
the
doctrine
may
also
be
considered
exploded
as
far
as
ideas
go
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
sort
of
consciousness
whatever
be
it
sensation
feeling
or
idea
which
does
not
directly
and
of
itself
tend
to
discharge
into
some
motor
effect
the
motor
effect
need
not
always
be
an
outward
stroke
of
behavior
it
may
be
only
an
alteration
of
the
or
breathing
or
a
modification
in
the
distribution
of
blood
such
as
blushing
or
turning
pale
or
else
a
secretion
of
tears
or
what
not
but
in
any
case
it
is
there
in
some
shape
when
any
consciousness
is
there
and
a
belief
as
fundamental
as
any
in
modern
psychology
is
the
belief
at
last
attained
that
conscious
processes
of
any
sort
conscious
processes
merely
as
such
pass
over
into
motion
open
or
concealed
the
least
complicated
case
of
this
tendency
is
the
case
of
a
mind
possessed
by
only
a
single
idea
if
that
idea
be
of
an
object
connected
with
a
native
impulse
the
impulse
will
immediately
proceed
to
discharge
if
it
be
the
idea
of
a
movement
the
movement
will
occur
such
a
case
of
action
from
a
single
idea
has
been
distinguished
from
more
complex
cases
by
the
name
of
action
meaning
action
without
express
decision
or
effort
most
of
the
habitual
actions
to
which
we
are
trained
are
of
this
sort
we
perceive
for
instance
that
the
door
is
open
and
we
rise
and
shut
it
we
perceive
some
raisins
in
a
dish
before
us
and
extend
our
hand
and
carry
one
of
them
to
our
mouth
without
interrupting
the
conversation
or
when
lying
in
bed
we
suddenly
think
that
we
shall
be
late
for
breakfast
and
instantly
we
get
up
with
no
particular
exertion
or
resolve
all
the
ingrained
procedures
by
which
life
is
carried
on
the
manners
and
customs
dressing
and
undressing
acts
of
salutation
are
executed
in
this
way
unhesitatingly
and
efficiently
the
very
outermost
margin
of
consciousness
seeming
to
be
concerned
in
them
while
the
focus
may
be
occupied
with
widely
different
things
but
now
turn
to
a
more
complicated
case
suppose
two
thoughts
to
be
in
the
mind
together
of
which
one
a
taken
alone
would
discharge
itself
in
a
certain
action
but
of
which
the
other
b
suggests
an
action
of
a
different
sort
or
a
consequence
of
the
first
action
calculated
to
make
us
shrink
the
psychologists
now
say
that
the
second
idea
b
will
probably
arrest
or
the
motor
effects
of
the
first
idea
a
one
word
then
about
in
general
to
make
this
particular
case
more
clear
one
of
the
most
interesting
discoveries
of
physiology
was
the
discovery
made
simultaneously
in
france
and
germany
fifty
years
ago
that
nerve
currents
do
not
only
start
muscles
into
action
but
may
check
action
already
going
on
or
keep
it
from
occurring
as
it
otherwise
might
of
were
thus
distinguished
alongside
of
motor
nerves
the
pneumogastric
nerve
for
example
if
stimulated
arrests
the
movements
of
the
heart
the
splanchnic
nerve
arrests
those
of
the
intestines
if
already
begun
but
it
soon
appeared
that
this
was
too
narrow
a
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
and
that
arrest
is
not
so
much
the
specific
function
of
certain
nerves
as
a
general
function
which
any
part
of
the
nervous
system
may
exert
upon
other
parts
under
the
appropriate
conditions
the
higher
centres
for
example
seem
to
exert
a
constant
inhibitive
influence
on
the
excitability
of
those
below
the
reflexes
of
an
animal
with
its
hemispheres
wholly
or
in
part
removed
become
exaggerated
you
all
know
that
common
reflex
in
dogs
whereby
if
you
scratch
the
animal
side
the
corresponding
hind
leg
will
begin
to
make
scratching
movements
usually
in
the
air
now
in
dogs
with
mutilated
hemispheres
this
scratching
reflex
is
so
incessant
that
as
goltz
first
described
them
the
hair
gets
all
worn
off
their
sides
in
idiots
the
functions
of
the
hemispheres
being
largely
in
abeyance
the
lower
impulses
not
inhibited
as
they
would
be
in
normal
human
beings
often
express
themselves
in
most
odious
ways
you
know
also
how
any
higher
emotional
tendency
will
quench
a
lower
one
fear
arrests
appetite
maternal
love
annuls
fear
respect
checks
sensuality
and
the
like
and
in
the
more
subtile
manifestations
of
the
moral
life
whenever
an
ideal
stirring
is
suddenly
quickened
into
intensity
it
is
as
if
the
whole
scale
of
values
of
our
motives
changed
its
equilibrium
the
force
of
old
temptations
vanishes
and
what
a
moment
ago
was
impossible
is
now
not
only
possible
but
easy
because
of
their
inhibition
this
has
been
well
called
the
power
of
the
higher
emotion
it
is
easy
to
apply
this
notion
of
inhibition
to
the
case
of
our
ideational
processes
i
am
lying
in
bed
for
example
and
think
it
is
time
to
get
up
but
alongside
of
this
thought
there
is
present
to
my
mind
a
realization
of
the
extreme
coldness
of
the
morning
and
the
pleasantness
of
the
warm
bed
in
such
a
situation
the
motor
consequences
of
the
first
idea
are
blocked
and
i
may
remain
for
half
an
hour
or
more
with
the
two
ideas
oscillating
before
me
in
a
kind
of
deadlock
which
is
what
we
call
the
state
of
hesitation
or
deliberation
in
a
case
like
this
the
deliberation
can
be
resolved
and
the
decision
reached
in
either
of
two
ways
i
may
forget
for
a
moment
the
thermometric
conditions
and
then
the
idea
of
getting
up
will
immediately
discharge
into
act
i
shall
suddenly
find
that
i
have
got
up
or
still
mindful
of
the
freezing
temperature
the
thought
of
the
duty
of
rising
may
become
so
pungent
that
it
determines
action
in
spite
of
inhibition
in
the
latter
case
i
have
a
sense
of
energetic
moral
effort
and
consider
that
i
have
done
a
virtuous
act
all
cases
of
wilful
action
properly
so
called
of
choice
after
hesitation
and
deliberation
may
be
conceived
after
one
of
these
latter
patterns
so
you
see
that
volition
in
the
narrower
sense
takes
place
only
when
there
are
a
number
of
conflicting
systems
of
ideas
and
depends
on
our
having
a
complex
field
of
consciousness
the
interesting
thing
to
note
is
the
extreme
delicacy
of
the
inhibitive
machinery
a
strong
and
urgent
motor
idea
in
the
focus
may
be
neutralized
and
made
inoperative
by
the
presence
of
the
very
faintest
contradictory
idea
in
the
margin
for
instance
i
hold
out
my
forefinger
and
with
closed
eyes
try
to
realize
as
vividly
as
possible
that
i
hold
a
revolver
in
my
hand
and
am
pulling
the
trigger
i
can
even
now
fairly
feel
my
finger
quivering
with
the
tendency
to
contract
and
if
it
were
hitched
to
a
recording
apparatus
it
would
certainly
betray
its
state
of
tension
by
registering
incipient
movements
yet
it
does
not
actually
crook
and
the
movement
of
pulling
the
trigger
is
not
performed
why
not
simply
because
all
concentrated
though
i
am
upon
the
idea
of
the
movement
i
nevertheless
also
realize
the
total
conditions
of
the
experiment
and
in
the
back
of
my
mind
so
to
speak
or
in
its
fringe
and
margin
have
the
simultaneous
idea
that
the
movement
is
not
to
take
place
the
mere
presence
of
that
marginal
intention
without
effort
urgency
or
emphasis
or
any
special
reinforcement
from
my
attention
suffices
to
the
inhibitive
effect
and
this
is
why
so
few
of
the
ideas
that
flit
through
our
minds
do
in
point
of
fact
produce
their
motor
consequences
life
would
be
a
curse
and
a
care
for
us
if
every
fleeting
fancy
were
to
do
so
abstractly
the
law
of
action
is
true
but
in
the
concrete
our
fields
of
consciousness
are
always
so
complex
that
the
inhibiting
margin
keeps
the
centre
inoperative
most
of
the
time
in
all
this
you
see
i
speak
as
if
ideas
by
their
mere
presence
or
absence
determined
behavior
and
as
if
between
the
ideas
themselves
on
the
one
hand
and
the
conduct
on
the
other
there
were
no
room
for
any
third
intermediate
principle
of
activity
like
that
called
will
if
you
are
struck
by
the
materialistic
or
fatalistic
doctrines
which
seem
to
follow
this
conception
i
beg
you
to
suspend
your
judgment
for
a
moment
as
i
shall
soon
have
something
more
to
say
about
the
matter
but
meanwhile
yielding
one
self
to
the
mechanical
conception
of
the
psychophysical
organism
nothing
is
easier
than
to
indulge
in
a
picture
of
the
fatalistic
character
of
human
life
man
conduct
appears
as
the
mere
resultant
of
all
his
various
impulsions
and
inhibitions
one
object
by
its
presence
makes
us
act
another
object
checks
our
action
feelings
aroused
and
ideas
suggested
by
objects
sway
us
one
way
and
another
emotions
complicate
the
game
by
their
mutual
inhibitive
effects
the
higher
abolishing
the
lower
or
perhaps
being
itself
swept
away
the
life
in
all
this
becomes
prudential
and
moral
but
the
psychologic
agents
in
the
drama
may
be
described
you
see
as
nothing
but
the
themselves
ideas
for
the
whole
system
of
which
what
we
call
the
or
character
or
of
the
person
is
nothing
but
a
collective
name
as
hume
said
the
ideas
are
themselves
the
actors
the
stage
the
theatre
the
spectators
and
the
play
this
is
the
psychology
brought
down
to
its
radical
expression
it
is
useless
to
ignore
its
power
as
a
conception
like
all
conceptions
when
they
become
clear
and
lively
enough
this
conception
has
a
strong
tendency
to
impose
itself
upon
belief
and
psychologists
trained
on
biological
lines
usually
adopt
it
as
the
last
word
of
science
on
the
subject
no
one
can
have
an
adequate
notion
of
modern
psychological
theory
unless
he
has
at
some
time
apprehended
this
view
in
the
full
force
of
its
simplicity
let
us
humor
it
for
a
while
for
it
has
advantages
in
the
way
of
exposition
action
then
is
at
all
times
a
resultant
of
the
compounding
of
our
impulsions
with
our
from
this
it
immediately
follows
that
there
will
be
two
types
of
will
in
one
of
which
impulsions
will
predominate
in
the
other
inhibitions
we
may
speak
of
them
if
you
like
as
the
precipitate
and
the
obstructed
will
respectively
when
fully
pronounced
they
are
familiar
to
everybody
the
extreme
example
of
the
precipitate
will
is
the
maniac
his
ideas
discharge
into
action
so
rapidly
his
associative
processes
are
so
extravagantly
lively
that
inhibitions
have
no
time
to
arrive
and
he
says
and
does
whatever
pops
into
his
head
without
a
moment
of
hesitation
certain
melancholiacs
furnish
the
extreme
example
of
the
type
their
minds
are
cramped
in
a
fixed
emotion
of
fear
or
helplessness
their
ideas
confined
to
the
one
thought
that
for
them
life
is
impossible
so
they
show
a
condition
of
perfect
or
inability
to
will
or
act
they
can
not
change
their
posture
or
speech
or
execute
the
simplest
command
the
different
races
of
men
show
different
temperaments
in
this
regard
the
southern
races
are
commonly
accounted
the
more
impulsive
and
precipitate
the
english
race
especially
our
new
england
branch
of
it
is
supposed
to
be
all
sicklied
over
with
repressive
forms
of
and
condemned
to
express
itself
through
a
jungle
of
scruples
and
checks
the
highest
form
of
character
however
abstractly
considered
must
be
full
of
scruples
and
inhibitions
but
action
in
such
a
character
far
from
being
paralyzed
will
succeed
in
energetically
keeping
on
its
way
sometimes
overpowering
the
resistances
sometimes
steering
along
the
line
where
they
lie
thinnest
just
as
our
extensor
muscles
act
most
truly
when
a
simultaneous
contraction
of
the
flexors
guides
and
steadies
them
so
the
mind
of
him
whose
fields
of
consciousness
are
complex
and
who
with
the
reasons
for
the
action
sees
the
reasons
against
it
and
yet
instead
of
being
palsied
acts
in
the
way
that
takes
the
whole
field
into
consideration
so
i
say
is
such
a
mind
the
ideal
sort
of
mind
that
we
should
seek
to
reproduce
in
our
pupils
purely
impulsive
action
or
action
that
proceeds
to
extremities
regardless
of
consequences
on
the
other
hand
is
the
easiest
action
in
the
world
and
the
lowest
in
type
any
one
can
show
energy
when
made
quite
reckless
an
oriental
despot
requires
but
little
ability
as
long
as
he
lives
he
succeeds
for
he
has
absolutely
his
own
way
and
when
the
world
can
no
longer
endure
the
horror
of
him
he
is
assassinated
but
not
to
proceed
immediately
to
extremities
to
be
still
able
to
act
energetically
under
an
array
of
inhibitions
that
indeed
is
rare
and
difficult
cavour
when
urged
to
proclaim
martial
law
in
refused
to
do
so
saying
any
one
can
govern
in
that
way
i
will
be
constitutional
your
parliamentary
rulers
your
lincoln
your
gladstone
are
the
strongest
type
of
man
because
they
accomplish
results
under
the
most
intricate
possible
conditions
we
think
of
napoleon
bonaparte
as
a
colossal
monster
of
and
truly
enough
he
was
so
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
psychological
machinery
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
he
or
gladstone
was
the
larger
volitional
quantity
for
napoleon
disregarded
all
the
usual
inhibitions
and
gladstone
passionate
as
he
was
scrupulously
considered
them
in
his
statesmanship
a
familiar
example
of
the
paralyzing
power
of
scruples
is
the
inhibitive
effect
of
conscientiousness
upon
conversation
nowhere
does
conversation
seem
to
have
flourished
as
brilliantly
as
in
france
during
the
last
century
but
if
we
read
old
french
memoirs
we
see
how
many
brakes
of
scrupulosity
which
tie
our
tongues
were
then
removed
where
mendacity
treachery
obscenity
and
malignity
find
unhampered
expression
talk
can
be
brilliant
indeed
but
its
flame
waxes
dim
where
the
mind
is
stitched
all
over
with
conscientious
fear
of
violating
the
moral
and
social
proprieties
the
teacher
often
is
confronted
in
the
schoolroom
with
an
abnormal
type
of
will
which
we
may
call
the
will
certain
children
if
they
do
not
succeed
in
doing
a
thing
immediately
remain
completely
inhibited
in
regard
to
it
it
becomes
literally
impossible
for
them
to
understand
it
if
it
be
an
intellectual
problem
or
to
do
it
if
it
be
an
outward
operation
as
long
as
this
particular
inhibited
condition
lasts
such
children
are
usually
treated
as
sinful
and
are
punished
or
else
the
teacher
pits
his
or
her
will
against
the
child
will
considering
that
the
latter
must
be
break
your
child
will
in
order
that
it
may
not
perish
wrote
john
wesley
break
its
will
as
soon
as
it
can
speak
plainly
or
even
before
it
can
speak
at
all
it
should
be
forced
to
do
as
it
is
told
even
if
you
have
to
whip
it
ten
times
running
break
its
will
in
order
that
its
soul
may
live
such
is
always
a
scene
with
a
great
deal
of
nervous
wear
and
tear
on
both
sides
a
bad
state
of
feeling
left
behind
it
and
the
victory
not
always
with
the
when
a
situation
of
the
kind
is
once
fairly
developed
and
the
child
is
all
tense
and
excited
inwardly
nineteen
times
out
of
twenty
it
is
best
for
the
teacher
to
apperceive
the
case
as
one
of
neural
pathology
rather
than
as
one
of
moral
culpability
so
long
as
the
inhibiting
sense
of
impossibility
remains
in
the
child
mind
he
will
continue
unable
to
get
beyond
the
obstacle
the
aim
of
the
teacher
should
then
be
to
make
him
simply
forget
drop
the
subject
for
the
time
divert
the
mind
to
something
else
then
leading
the
pupil
back
by
some
circuitous
line
of
association
spring
it
on
him
again
before
he
has
time
to
recognize
it
and
as
likely
as
not
he
will
go
over
it
now
without
any
difficulty
it
is
in
no
other
way
that
we
overcome
balkiness
in
a
horse
we
divert
his
attention
do
something
to
his
nose
or
ear
lead
him
round
in
a
circle
and
thus
get
him
over
a
place
where
flogging
would
only
have
made
him
more
invincible
a
tactful
teacher
will
never
let
these
strained
situations
come
up
at
all
you
perceive
now
my
friends
what
your
general
or
abstract
duty
is
as
teachers
although
you
have
to
generate
in
your
pupils
a
large
stock
of
ideas
any
one
of
which
may
be
inhibitory
yet
you
must
also
see
to
it
that
no
habitual
hesitancy
or
paralysis
of
the
will
ensues
and
that
the
pupil
still
retains
his
power
of
vigorous
action
psychology
can
state
your
problem
in
these
terms
but
you
see
how
impotent
she
is
to
furnish
the
elements
of
its
practical
solution
when
all
is
said
and
done
and
your
best
efforts
are
made
it
will
probably
remain
true
that
the
result
will
depend
more
on
a
certain
native
tone
or
temper
in
the
pupil
psychological
constitution
than
on
anything
else
some
persons
appear
to
have
a
naturally
poor
focalization
of
the
field
of
consciousness
and
in
such
persons
actions
hang
slack
and
inhibitions
seem
to
exert
peculiarly
easy
sway
but
let
us
now
close
in
a
little
more
closely
on
this
matter
of
the
education
of
the
will
your
task
is
to
build
up
a
in
your
pupils
and
a
character
as
i
have
so
often
said
consists
in
an
organized
set
of
habits
of
reaction
now
of
what
do
such
habits
of
reaction
themselves
consist
they
consist
of
tendencies
to
act
characteristically
when
certain
ideas
possess
us
and
to
refrain
characteristically
when
possessed
by
other
ideas
our
volitional
habits
depend
then
first
on
what
the
stock
of
ideas
is
which
we
have
and
second
on
the
habitual
coupling
of
the
several
ideas
with
action
or
inaction
respectively
how
is
it
when
an
alternative
is
presented
to
you
for
choice
and
you
are
uncertain
what
you
ought
to
do
you
first
hesitate
and
then
you
deliberate
and
in
what
does
your
deliberation
consist
it
consists
in
trying
to
apperceive
the
ease
successively
by
a
number
of
different
ideas
which
seem
to
fit
it
more
or
less
until
at
last
you
hit
on
one
which
seems
to
fit
it
exactly
if
that
be
an
idea
which
is
a
customary
forerunner
of
action
in
you
which
enters
into
one
of
your
maxims
of
positive
behavior
your
hesitation
ceases
and
you
act
immediately
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
an
idea
which
carries
inaction
as
its
habitual
result
if
it
ally
itself
with
then
you
unhesitatingly
refrain
the
problem
is
you
see
to
find
the
right
idea
or
conception
for
the
case
this
search
for
the
right
conception
may
take
days
or
weeks
i
spoke
as
if
the
action
were
easy
when
the
conception
once
is
found
often
it
is
so
but
it
may
be
otherwise
and
when
it
is
otherwise
we
find
ourselves
at
the
very
centre
of
a
moral
situation
into
which
i
should
now
like
you
to
look
with
me
a
little
nearer
the
proper
conception
the
true
head
of
classification
may
be
hard
to
attain
or
it
may
be
one
with
which
we
have
contracted
no
settled
habits
of
action
or
again
the
action
to
which
it
would
prompt
may
be
dangerous
and
difficult
or
else
inaction
may
appear
deadly
cold
and
negative
when
our
impulsive
feeling
is
hot
in
either
of
these
latter
cases
it
is
hard
to
hold
the
right
idea
steadily
enough
before
the
attention
to
let
it
exert
its
adequate
effects
whether
it
be
stimulative
or
inhibitive
it
is
for
us
and
the
more
instinctive
passional
propensity
then
tends
to
extrude
it
from
our
consideration
we
shy
away
from
the
thought
of
it
it
twinkles
and
goes
out
the
moment
it
appears
in
the
margin
of
our
consciousness
and
we
need
a
resolute
effort
of
voluntary
attention
to
drag
it
into
the
focus
of
the
field
and
to
keep
it
there
long
enough
for
its
associative
and
motor
effects
to
be
exerted
every
one
knows
only
too
well
how
the
mind
flinches
from
looking
at
considerations
hostile
to
the
reigning
mood
of
feeling
once
brought
however
in
this
way
to
the
centre
of
the
field
of
consciousness
and
held
there
the
reasonable
idea
will
exert
these
effects
inevitably
for
the
laws
of
connection
between
our
consciousness
and
our
nervous
system
provide
for
the
action
then
taking
place
our
moral
effort
properly
so
called
terminates
in
our
holding
fast
to
the
appropriate
idea
if
then
you
are
asked
what
does
a
moral
act
when
reduced
to
its
simplest
and
most
elementary
form
you
can
make
only
one
reply
you
can
say
that
consists
in
the
effort
of
attention
by
which
we
hold
fast
to
an
which
but
for
that
effort
of
attention
would
be
driven
out
of
the
mind
by
the
other
psychological
tendencies
that
are
there
in
short
is
the
secret
of
will
just
as
it
is
the
secret
of
memory
this
comes
out
very
clearly
in
the
kind
of
excuse
which
we
most
frequently
hear
from
persons
who
find
themselves
confronted
by
the
sinfulness
or
harmfulness
of
some
part
of
their
behavior
i
never
they
say
i
never
how
mean
the
action
was
i
never
of
these
abominable
consequences
and
what
do
we
retort
when
they
say
this
we
say
why
you
think
what
were
you
there
for
but
to
think
and
we
read
them
a
moral
lecture
on
their
irreflectiveness
the
hackneyed
example
of
moral
deliberation
is
the
case
of
an
habitual
drunkard
under
temptation
he
has
made
a
resolve
to
reform
but
he
is
now
solicited
again
by
the
bottle
his
moral
triumph
or
failure
literally
consists
in
his
finding
the
right
for
the
case
if
he
says
that
it
is
a
case
of
not
wasting
good
liquor
already
poured
out
or
a
case
of
not
being
churlish
and
unsociable
when
in
the
midst
of
friends
or
a
case
of
learning
something
at
last
about
a
brand
of
whiskey
which
he
never
met
before
or
a
case
of
celebrating
a
public
holiday
or
a
case
of
stimulating
himself
to
a
more
energetic
resolve
in
favor
of
abstinence
than
any
he
has
ever
yet
made
then
he
is
lost
his
choice
of
the
wrong
name
seals
his
doom
but
if
in
spite
of
all
the
plausible
good
names
with
which
his
thirsty
fancy
so
copiously
furnishes
him
he
unwaveringly
clings
to
the
truer
bad
name
and
apperceives
the
case
as
that
of
being
a
drunkard
being
a
drunkard
being
a
drunkard
his
feet
are
planted
on
the
road
to
salvation
he
saves
himself
by
thinking
rightly
thus
are
your
pupils
to
be
saved
first
by
the
stock
of
ideas
with
which
you
furnish
them
second
by
the
amount
of
voluntary
attention
that
they
can
exert
in
holding
to
the
right
ones
however
unpalatable
and
third
by
the
several
habits
of
acting
definitely
on
these
latter
to
which
they
have
been
successfully
trained
in
all
this
the
power
of
voluntarily
attending
is
the
point
of
the
whole
procedure
just
as
a
balance
turns
on
its
so
on
it
our
moral
destiny
turns
you
remember
that
when
we
were
talking
of
the
subject
of
attention
we
discovered
how
much
more
intermittent
and
brief
our
acts
of
voluntary
attention
are
than
is
commonly
supposed
if
they
were
all
summed
together
the
time
that
they
occupy
would
cover
an
almost
incredibly
small
portion
of
our
lives
but
i
also
said
you
will
remember
that
their
brevity
was
not
in
proportion
to
their
significance
and
that
i
should
return
to
the
subject
again
so
i
return
to
it
now
it
is
not
the
mere
size
of
a
thing
which
constitutes
its
importance
it
is
its
position
in
the
organism
to
which
it
belongs
our
acts
of
voluntary
attention
brief
and
fitful
as
they
are
are
nevertheless
momentous
and
critical
determining
us
as
they
do
to
higher
or
lower
destinies
the
exercise
of
voluntary
attention
in
the
schoolroom
must
therefore
be
counted
one
of
the
most
important
points
of
training
that
take
place
there
and
the
teacher
by
the
keenness
of
the
remoter
interests
which
he
is
able
to
awaken
will
provide
abundant
opportunities
for
its
occurrence
i
hope
that
you
appreciate
this
now
without
any
further
explanation
i
have
been
accused
of
holding
up
before
you
in
the
course
of
these
talks
a
mechanical
and
even
a
materialistic
view
of
the
mind
i
have
called
it
an
organism
and
a
machine
i
have
spoken
of
its
reaction
on
the
environment
as
the
essential
thing
about
it
and
i
have
referred
this
either
openly
or
implicitly
to
the
construction
of
the
nervous
system
i
have
in
consequence
received
notes
from
some
of
you
begging
me
to
be
more
explicit
on
this
point
and
to
let
you
know
frankly
whether
i
am
a
complete
materialist
or
not
now
in
these
lectures
i
wish
to
be
strictly
practical
and
useful
and
to
keep
free
from
all
speculative
complications
nevertheless
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
any
ambiguity
about
my
own
position
and
i
will
therefore
say
in
order
to
avoid
all
misunderstanding
that
in
no
sense
do
i
count
myself
a
materialist
i
can
not
see
how
such
a
thing
as
our
consciousness
can
possibly
be
by
a
nervous
machinery
though
i
can
perfectly
well
see
how
if
do
accompany
the
workings
of
the
machinery
the
of
the
ideas
might
very
well
follow
exactly
the
of
the
machine
operations
our
habitual
associations
of
ideas
trains
of
thought
and
sequences
of
action
might
thus
be
consequences
of
the
succession
of
currents
in
our
nervous
systems
and
the
possible
stock
of
ideas
which
a
man
free
spirit
would
have
to
choose
from
might
depend
exclusively
on
the
native
and
acquired
powers
of
his
brain
if
this
were
all
we
might
indeed
adopt
the
fatalist
conception
which
i
sketched
for
you
but
a
short
while
ago
our
ideas
would
be
determined
by
brain
currents
and
these
by
purely
mechanical
laws
but
after
what
we
have
just
seen
namely
the
part
played
by
voluntary
attention
in
volition
a
belief
in
free
will
and
purely
spiritual
causation
is
still
open
to
us
the
duration
and
amount
of
this
attention
within
certain
limits
indeterminate
we
as
if
we
could
make
it
really
more
or
less
and
as
if
our
free
action
in
this
regard
were
a
genuine
critical
point
in
nature
a
point
on
which
our
destiny
and
that
of
others
might
hinge
the
whole
question
of
free
will
concentrates
itself
then
at
this
same
small
point
is
or
is
not
the
appearance
of
indetermination
at
this
point
an
illusion
it
is
plain
that
such
a
question
can
be
decided
only
by
general
analogies
and
not
by
accurate
observations
the
believes
the
appearance
to
be
a
reality
the
determinist
believes
that
it
is
an
illusion
i
myself
hold
with
the
not
because
i
can
not
conceive
the
fatalist
theory
clearly
or
because
i
fail
to
understand
its
plausibility
but
simply
because
if
free
will
true
it
would
be
absurd
to
have
the
belief
in
it
fatally
forced
on
our
acceptance
considering
the
inner
fitness
of
things
one
would
rather
think
that
the
very
first
act
of
a
will
endowed
with
freedom
should
be
to
sustain
the
belief
in
the
freedom
itself
i
accordingly
believe
freely
in
my
freedom
i
do
so
with
the
best
of
scientific
consciences
knowing
that
the
predetermination
of
the
amount
of
my
effort
of
attention
can
never
receive
objective
proof
and
hoping
that
whether
you
follow
my
example
in
this
respect
or
not
it
will
at
least
make
you
see
that
such
psychological
and
psychophysical
theories
as
i
hold
do
not
necessarily
force
a
man
to
become
a
fatalist
or
a
materialist
let
me
say
one
more
final
word
now
about
the
will
and
therewith
conclude
both
that
important
subject
and
these
lectures
there
are
two
types
of
will
there
are
also
two
types
of
inhibition
we
may
call
them
inhibition
by
repression
or
by
negation
and
inhibition
by
substitution
respectively
the
difference
between
them
is
that
in
the
case
of
inhibition
by
repression
both
the
inhibited
idea
and
the
inhibiting
idea
the
impulsive
idea
and
the
idea
that
negates
it
remain
along
with
each
other
in
consciousness
producing
a
certain
inward
strain
or
tension
there
whereas
in
inhibition
by
substitution
the
inhibiting
idea
supersedes
altogether
the
idea
which
it
inhibits
and
the
latter
quickly
vanishes
from
the
field
for
instance
your
pupils
are
wandering
in
mind
are
listening
to
a
sound
outside
the
window
which
presently
grows
interesting
enough
to
claim
all
their
attention
you
can
call
the
latter
back
again
by
bellowing
at
them
not
to
listen
to
those
sounds
but
to
keep
their
minds
on
their
books
or
on
what
you
are
saying
and
by
thus
keeping
them
conscious
that
your
eye
is
sternly
on
them
you
may
produce
a
good
effect
but
it
will
be
a
wasteful
effect
and
an
inferior
effect
for
the
moment
you
relax
your
supervision
the
attractive
disturbance
always
there
soliciting
their
curiosity
will
overpower
them
and
they
will
be
just
as
they
were
before
whereas
if
without
saying
anything
about
the
street
disturbances
you
open
a
by
starting
some
very
interesting
talk
or
demonstration
yourself
they
will
altogether
forget
the
distracting
incident
and
without
any
effort
follow
you
along
there
are
many
interests
that
can
never
be
inhibited
by
the
way
of
negation
to
a
man
in
love
for
example
it
is
literally
impossible
by
any
effort
of
will
to
annul
his
passion
but
let
new
planet
swim
into
his
ken
and
the
former
idol
will
immediately
cease
to
engross
his
mind
it
is
clear
that
in
general
we
ought
whenever
we
can
to
employ
the
method
of
inhibition
by
substitution
he
whose
life
is
based
upon
the
word
who
tells
the
truth
because
a
lie
is
wicked
and
who
has
constantly
to
grapple
with
his
envious
and
cowardly
and
mean
propensities
is
in
an
inferior
situation
in
every
respect
to
what
he
would
be
if
the
love
of
truth
and
magnanimity
positively
possessed
him
from
the
outset
and
he
felt
no
inferior
temptations
your
born
gentleman
is
certainly
for
this
world
purposes
a
more
valuable
being
than
your
crump
with
his
grunting
resistance
to
his
native
devils
even
though
in
god
sight
the
latter
may
as
the
catholic
theologians
say
be
rolling
up
great
stores
of
spinoza
long
ago
wrote
in
his
ethics
that
anything
that
a
man
can
avoid
under
the
notion
that
it
is
bad
he
may
also
avoid
under
the
notion
that
something
else
is
good
he
who
habitually
acts
specie
under
the
negative
notion
the
notion
of
the
bad
is
called
a
slave
by
spinoza
to
him
who
acts
habitually
under
the
notion
of
good
he
gives
the
name
of
freeman
see
to
it
now
i
beg
you
that
you
make
freemen
of
your
pupils
by
habituating
them
to
act
whenever
possible
under
the
notion
of
a
good
get
them
habitually
to
tell
the
truth
not
so
much
through
showing
them
the
wickedness
of
lying
as
by
arousing
their
enthusiasm
for
honor
and
veracity
wean
them
from
their
native
cruelty
by
imparting
to
them
some
of
your
own
positive
sympathy
with
an
inner
springs
of
joy
and
in
the
lessons
which
you
may
be
legally
obliged
to
conduct
upon
the
bad
effects
of
alcohol
lay
less
stress
than
the
books
do
on
the
drunkard
stomach
kidneys
nerves
and
social
miseries
and
more
on
the
blessings
of
having
an
organism
kept
in
lifelong
possession
of
its
full
youthful
elasticity
by
a
sweet
sound
blood
to
which
stimulants
and
narcotics
are
unknown
and
to
which
the
morning
sun
and
air
and
dew
will
daily
come
as
sufficiently
powerful
intoxicants
i
have
now
ended
these
talks
if
to
some
of
you
the
things
i
have
said
seem
obvious
or
trivial
it
is
possible
that
they
may
appear
less
so
when
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
you
find
yourselves
noticing
and
apperceiving
events
in
the
schoolroom
a
little
differently
in
consequence
of
some
of
the
conceptions
i
have
tried
to
make
more
clear
i
can
not
but
think
that
to
apperceive
your
pupil
as
a
little
sensitive
impulsive
associative
and
reactive
organism
partly
fated
and
partly
free
will
lead
to
a
better
intelligence
of
all
his
ways
understand
him
then
as
such
a
subtle
little
piece
of
machinery
and
if
in
addition
you
can
also
see
him
specie
and
love
him
as
well
you
will
be
in
the
best
possible
position
for
becoming
perfect
teachers
talks
to
students
i
the
gospel
of
relaxation
i
wish
in
the
following
hour
to
take
certain
psychological
doctrines
and
show
their
practical
applications
to
mental
hygiene
to
the
hygiene
of
our
american
life
more
particularly
our
people
especially
in
academic
circles
are
turning
towards
psychology
nowadays
with
great
expectations
and
if
psychology
is
to
justify
them
it
must
be
by
showing
fruits
in
the
pedagogic
and
therapeutic
lines
the
reader
may
possibly
have
heard
of
a
peculiar
theory
of
the
emotions
commonly
referred
to
in
psychological
literature
as
the
theory
according
to
this
theory
our
emotions
are
mainly
due
to
those
organic
stirrings
that
are
aroused
in
us
in
a
reflex
way
by
the
stimulus
of
the
exciting
object
or
situation
an
emotion
of
fear
for
example
or
surprise
is
not
a
direct
effect
of
the
object
presence
on
the
mind
but
an
effect
of
that
still
earlier
effect
the
bodily
commotion
which
the
object
suddenly
excites
so
that
were
this
bodily
commotion
suppressed
we
should
not
so
much
fear
as
call
the
situation
fearful
we
should
not
feel
surprise
but
coldly
recognize
that
the
object
was
indeed
astonishing
one
enthusiast
has
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
when
we
feel
sorry
it
is
because
we
weep
when
we
feel
afraid
it
is
because
we
run
away
and
not
conversely
some
of
you
may
perhaps
be
acquainted
with
the
paradoxical
formula
now
whatever
exaggeration
may
possibly
lurk
in
this
account
of
our
emotions
and
i
doubt
myself
whether
the
exaggeration
be
very
great
it
is
certain
that
the
main
core
of
it
is
true
and
that
the
mere
giving
way
to
tears
for
example
or
to
the
outward
expression
of
an
will
result
for
the
moment
in
making
the
inner
grief
or
anger
more
acutely
felt
there
is
accordingly
no
better
known
or
more
generally
useful
precept
in
the
moral
training
of
youth
or
in
one
personal
than
that
which
bids
us
pay
primary
attention
to
what
we
do
and
express
and
not
to
care
too
much
for
what
we
feel
if
we
only
check
a
cowardly
impulse
in
time
for
example
or
if
we
only
strike
the
blow
or
rip
out
with
the
complaining
or
insulting
word
that
we
shall
regret
as
long
as
we
live
our
feelings
themselves
will
presently
be
the
calmer
and
better
with
no
particular
guidance
from
us
on
their
own
account
action
seems
to
follow
feeling
but
really
action
and
feeling
go
together
and
by
regulating
the
action
which
is
under
the
more
direct
control
of
the
will
we
can
indirectly
regulate
the
feeling
which
is
not
thus
the
sovereign
voluntary
path
to
cheerfulness
if
our
spontaneous
cheerfulness
be
lost
is
to
sit
up
cheerfully
to
look
round
cheerfully
and
to
act
and
speak
as
if
cheerfulness
were
already
there
if
such
conduct
does
not
make
you
soon
feel
cheerful
nothing
else
on
that
occasion
can
so
to
feel
brave
act
as
if
we
brave
use
all
our
will
to
that
end
and
a
will
very
likely
replace
the
fit
of
fear
again
in
order
to
feel
kindly
toward
a
person
to
whom
we
have
been
inimical
the
only
way
is
more
or
less
deliberately
to
smile
to
make
sympathetic
inquiries
and
to
force
ourselves
to
say
genial
things
one
hearty
laugh
together
will
bring
enemies
into
a
closer
communion
of
heart
than
hours
spent
on
both
sides
in
inward
wrestling
with
the
mental
demon
of
uncharitable
feeling
to
wrestle
with
a
bad
feeling
only
pins
our
attention
on
it
and
keeps
it
still
fastened
in
the
mind
whereas
if
we
act
as
if
from
some
better
feeling
the
old
bad
feeling
soon
folds
its
tent
like
an
arab
and
silently
steals
away
the
best
manuals
of
religious
devotion
accordingly
reiterate
the
maxim
that
we
must
let
our
feelings
go
and
pay
no
regard
to
them
whatever
in
an
admirable
and
widely
successful
little
book
called
secret
of
a
happy
life
by
hannah
whitall
smith
i
find
this
lesson
on
almost
every
page
faithfully
and
you
really
have
faith
no
matter
how
cold
and
even
how
dubious
you
may
feel
it
is
your
purpose
god
looks
at
writes
smith
not
your
feelings
about
that
purpose
and
your
purpose
or
will
is
therefore
the
only
thing
you
need
attend
to
let
your
emotions
come
or
let
them
go
just
as
god
pleases
and
make
no
account
of
them
either
way
they
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
they
are
not
the
indicators
of
your
spiritual
state
but
are
merely
the
indicators
of
your
temperament
or
of
your
present
physical
condition
but
you
all
know
these
facts
already
so
i
need
no
longer
press
them
on
your
attention
from
our
acts
and
from
our
attitudes
ceaseless
inpouring
currents
of
sensation
come
which
help
to
determine
from
moment
to
moment
what
our
inner
states
shall
be
that
is
a
fundamental
law
of
psychology
which
i
will
therefore
proceed
to
assume
a
viennese
neurologist
of
considerable
reputation
has
recently
written
about
the
as
he
terms
it
or
buried
life
of
human
beings
no
doctor
this
writer
says
can
get
into
really
profitable
relations
with
a
nervous
patient
until
he
gets
some
sense
of
what
the
is
of
the
sort
of
unuttered
inner
atmosphere
in
which
his
consciousness
dwells
alone
with
the
secrets
of
its
this
inner
personal
tone
is
what
we
ca
communicate
or
describe
articulately
to
others
but
the
wraith
and
ghost
of
it
so
to
speak
are
often
what
our
friends
and
intimates
feel
as
our
most
characteristic
quality
in
the
apart
from
all
sorts
of
old
regrets
ambitions
checked
by
shames
and
aspirations
obstructed
by
timidities
it
consists
mainly
of
bodily
discomforts
not
distinctly
localized
by
the
sufferer
but
breeding
a
general
and
sense
that
things
are
not
as
they
should
be
with
him
half
the
thirst
for
alcohol
that
exists
in
the
world
exists
simply
because
alcohol
acts
as
a
temporary
anæsthetic
and
effacer
to
all
these
morbid
feelings
that
never
ought
to
be
in
a
human
being
at
all
in
the
on
the
contrary
there
are
no
fears
or
shames
to
discover
and
the
sensations
that
pour
in
from
the
organism
only
help
to
swell
the
general
vital
sense
of
security
and
readiness
for
anything
that
may
turn
up
consider
for
example
the
effects
of
a
nervous
and
muscular
on
our
general
personal
the
sense
of
elasticity
and
efficiency
that
results
they
tell
us
that
in
norway
the
life
of
the
women
has
lately
been
entirely
revolutionized
by
the
new
order
of
muscular
feelings
with
which
the
use
of
the
or
long
as
a
sport
for
both
sexes
has
made
the
women
acquainted
fifteen
years
ago
the
norwegian
women
were
even
more
than
the
women
of
other
lands
votaries
of
the
ideal
of
femininity
domestic
angel
the
and
refining
sort
of
thing
now
these
sedentary
fireside
of
norway
have
been
trained
they
say
by
the
into
lithe
and
audacious
creatures
for
whom
no
night
is
too
dark
or
height
too
giddy
and
who
are
not
only
saying
to
the
traditional
feminine
pallor
and
delicacy
of
constitution
but
actually
taking
the
lead
in
every
educational
and
social
reform
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
tennis
and
tramping
and
skating
habits
and
the
which
are
so
rapidly
extending
among
our
dear
sisters
and
daughters
in
this
country
are
going
also
to
lead
to
a
sounder
and
heartier
moral
tone
which
will
send
its
tonic
breath
through
all
our
american
life
i
hope
that
here
in
america
more
and
more
the
ideal
of
the
and
vigorous
body
will
be
maintained
neck
by
neck
with
that
of
the
and
vigorous
mind
as
the
two
coequal
halves
of
the
higher
education
for
men
and
women
alike
the
strength
of
the
british
empire
lies
in
the
strength
of
character
of
the
individual
englishman
taken
all
alone
by
himself
and
that
strength
i
am
persuaded
is
perennially
nourished
and
kept
up
by
nothing
so
much
as
by
the
national
worship
in
which
all
classes
meet
of
athletic
outdoor
life
and
sport
i
recollect
years
ago
reading
a
certain
work
by
an
american
doctor
on
hygiene
and
the
laws
of
life
and
the
type
of
future
humanity
i
have
forgotten
its
author
name
and
its
title
but
i
remember
well
an
awful
prophecy
that
it
contained
about
the
future
of
our
muscular
system
human
perfection
the
writer
said
means
ability
to
cope
with
the
environment
but
the
environment
will
more
and
more
require
mental
power
from
us
and
less
and
less
will
ask
for
bare
brute
strength
wars
will
cease
machines
will
do
all
our
heavy
work
man
will
become
more
and
more
a
mere
director
of
nature
energies
and
less
and
less
an
exerter
of
energy
on
his
own
account
so
that
if
the
of
the
future
can
only
digest
his
food
and
think
what
need
will
he
have
of
muscles
at
all
and
why
pursued
this
writer
should
we
not
even
now
be
satisfied
with
a
more
delicate
and
intellectual
type
of
beauty
than
that
which
pleased
our
ancestors
nay
i
have
heard
a
fanciful
friend
make
a
still
further
advance
in
this
direction
with
our
future
food
he
says
itself
prepared
in
liquid
form
from
the
chemical
elements
of
the
atmosphere
pepsinated
or
in
advance
and
sucked
up
through
a
glass
tube
from
a
tin
can
what
need
shall
we
have
of
teeth
or
stomachs
even
they
may
go
along
with
our
muscles
and
our
physical
courage
while
challenging
ever
more
and
more
our
proper
admiration
will
grow
the
gigantic
domes
of
our
crania
arching
over
our
spectacled
eyes
and
animating
our
flexible
little
lips
to
those
floods
of
learned
and
ingenious
talk
which
will
constitute
our
most
congenial
occupation
i
am
sure
that
your
flesh
creeps
at
this
apocalyptic
vision
mine
certainly
did
so
and
i
can
not
believe
that
our
muscular
vigor
will
ever
be
a
superfluity
even
if
the
day
ever
dawns
in
which
it
will
not
be
needed
for
fighting
the
old
heavy
battles
against
nature
it
will
still
always
be
needed
to
furnish
the
background
of
sanity
serenity
and
cheerfulness
to
life
to
give
moral
elasticity
to
our
disposition
to
round
off
the
wiry
edge
of
our
fretfulness
and
make
us
and
easy
of
approach
weakness
is
too
apt
to
be
what
the
doctors
call
irritable
weakness
and
that
blessed
internal
peace
and
confidence
that
in
as
spinoza
used
to
call
it
that
wells
up
from
every
part
of
the
body
of
a
muscularly
human
being
and
soaks
the
indwelling
soul
of
him
with
satisfaction
is
quite
apart
from
every
consideration
of
its
mechanical
utility
an
element
of
spiritual
hygiene
of
supreme
significance
and
now
let
me
go
a
step
deeper
into
mental
hygiene
and
try
to
enlist
your
insight
and
sympathy
in
a
cause
which
i
believe
is
one
of
paramount
patriotic
importance
to
us
yankees
many
years
ago
a
scottish
medical
man
clouston
a
as
they
call
him
there
or
what
we
should
call
an
asylum
physician
the
most
eminent
one
in
scotland
visited
this
country
and
said
something
that
has
remained
in
my
memory
ever
since
you
americans
he
said
wear
too
much
expression
on
your
faces
you
are
living
like
an
army
with
all
its
reserves
engaged
in
action
the
duller
countenances
of
the
british
population
betoken
a
better
scheme
of
life
they
suggest
stores
of
reserved
nervous
force
to
fall
back
upon
if
any
occasion
should
arise
that
requires
it
this
inexcitability
this
presence
at
all
times
of
power
not
used
i
regard
continued
clouston
as
the
great
safeguard
of
our
british
people
the
other
thing
in
you
gives
me
a
sense
of
insecurity
and
you
ought
somehow
to
tone
yourselves
down
you
really
do
carry
too
much
expression
you
take
too
intensely
the
trivial
moments
of
life
now
clouston
is
a
trained
reader
of
the
secrets
of
the
soul
as
expressed
upon
the
countenance
and
the
observation
of
his
which
i
quote
seems
to
me
to
mean
a
great
deal
and
all
americans
who
stay
in
europe
long
enough
to
get
accustomed
to
the
spirit
that
reigns
and
expresses
itself
there
so
unexcitable
as
compared
with
ours
make
a
similar
observation
when
they
return
to
their
native
shores
they
find
a
look
upon
their
compatriots
faces
either
of
too
desperate
eagerness
and
anxiety
or
of
too
intense
responsiveness
and
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
the
men
or
the
women
show
it
most
it
is
true
that
we
do
not
all
feel
about
it
as
clouston
felt
many
of
us
far
from
deploring
it
admire
it
we
say
what
intelligence
it
shows
how
different
from
the
stolid
cheeks
the
codfish
eyes
the
slow
inanimate
demeanor
we
have
been
seeing
in
the
british
isles
intensity
rapidity
vivacity
of
appearance
are
indeed
with
us
something
of
a
nationally
accepted
ideal
and
the
medical
notion
of
weakness
is
not
the
first
thing
suggested
by
them
to
our
mind
as
it
was
to
clouston
in
a
weekly
paper
not
very
long
ago
i
remember
reading
a
story
in
which
after
describing
the
beauty
and
interest
of
the
heroine
personality
the
author
summed
up
her
charms
by
saying
that
to
all
who
looked
upon
her
an
impression
as
of
lightning
was
irresistibly
conveyed
bottled
lightning
in
truth
is
one
of
our
american
ideals
even
of
a
young
girl
character
now
it
is
most
ungracious
and
it
may
seem
to
some
persons
unpatriotic
to
criticise
in
public
the
physical
peculiarities
of
one
own
people
of
one
own
family
so
to
speak
besides
it
may
be
said
and
said
with
justice
that
there
are
plenty
of
temperaments
in
other
countries
and
plenty
of
phlegmatic
temperaments
here
and
that
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
more
or
less
of
tension
about
which
i
am
making
such
a
fuss
is
a
very
small
item
in
the
sum
total
of
a
nation
life
and
not
worth
solemn
treatment
at
a
time
when
agreeable
rather
than
disagreeable
things
should
be
talked
about
well
in
one
sense
the
more
or
less
of
tension
in
our
faces
and
in
our
unused
muscles
is
a
small
thing
not
much
mechanical
work
is
done
by
these
contractions
but
it
is
not
always
the
material
size
of
a
thing
that
measures
its
importance
often
it
is
its
place
and
function
one
of
the
most
philosophical
remarks
i
ever
heard
made
was
by
an
unlettered
workman
who
was
doing
some
repairs
at
my
house
many
years
ago
there
is
very
little
difference
between
one
man
and
another
he
said
when
you
go
to
the
bottom
of
it
but
what
little
there
is
is
very
important
and
the
remark
certainly
applies
to
this
case
the
general
may
be
small
when
estimated
in
but
its
importance
is
immense
on
account
of
its
on
the
person
spiritual
this
follows
as
a
necessary
consequence
from
the
theory
of
our
emotions
to
which
i
made
reference
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
for
by
the
sensations
that
so
incessantly
pour
in
from
the
excited
body
the
and
excited
habit
of
mind
is
kept
up
and
the
sultry
threatening
exhausting
thunderous
inner
atmosphere
never
quite
clears
away
if
you
never
wholly
give
yourself
up
to
the
chair
you
sit
in
but
always
keep
your
and
half
contracted
for
a
rise
if
you
breathe
eighteen
or
nineteen
instead
of
sixteen
times
a
minute
and
never
quite
breathe
out
at
that
what
mental
mood
you
be
in
but
one
of
inner
panting
and
expectancy
and
how
can
the
future
and
its
worries
possibly
forsake
your
mind
on
the
other
hand
how
can
they
gain
admission
to
your
mind
if
your
brow
be
unruffled
your
respiration
calm
and
complete
and
your
muscles
all
relaxed
now
what
is
the
cause
of
this
absence
of
repose
this
quality
in
us
americans
the
explanation
of
it
that
is
usually
given
is
that
it
comes
from
the
extreme
dryness
of
our
climate
and
the
acrobatic
performances
of
our
thermometer
coupled
with
the
extraordinary
progressiveness
of
our
life
the
hard
work
the
railroad
speed
the
rapid
success
and
all
the
other
things
we
know
so
well
by
heart
well
our
climate
is
certainly
exciting
but
hardly
more
so
than
that
of
many
parts
of
europe
where
nevertheless
no
girls
are
found
and
the
work
done
and
the
pace
of
life
are
as
extreme
an
every
great
capital
of
europe
as
they
are
here
to
me
both
of
these
pretended
causes
are
utterly
insufficient
to
explain
the
facts
to
explain
them
we
must
go
not
to
physical
geography
but
to
psychology
and
sociology
the
latest
chapter
both
in
sociology
and
in
psychology
to
be
developed
in
a
manner
that
approaches
adequacy
is
the
chapter
on
the
imitative
impulse
first
bagehot
then
tarde
then
royce
and
baldwin
here
have
shown
that
invention
and
imitation
taken
together
form
one
may
say
the
entire
warp
and
woof
of
human
life
in
so
far
as
it
is
social
the
american
and
jerkiness
and
breathlessness
and
intensity
and
agony
of
expression
are
primarily
social
and
only
secondarily
physiological
phenomena
they
are
nothing
more
or
less
bred
of
custom
and
example
born
of
the
imitation
of
bad
models
and
the
cultivation
of
false
personal
ideals
how
are
idioms
acquired
how
do
local
peculiarities
of
phrase
and
accent
come
about
through
an
accidental
example
set
by
some
one
which
struck
the
ears
of
others
and
was
quoted
and
copied
till
at
last
every
one
in
the
locality
chimed
in
just
so
it
is
with
national
tricks
of
vocalization
or
intonation
with
national
manners
fashions
of
movement
and
gesture
and
habitual
expressions
of
face
we
here
in
america
through
following
a
succession
of
whom
it
is
now
impossible
to
trace
and
through
influencing
each
other
in
a
bad
direction
have
at
last
settled
down
collectively
into
what
for
better
or
worse
is
our
own
characteristic
national
type
a
type
with
the
production
of
which
so
far
as
these
habits
go
the
climate
and
conditions
have
had
practically
nothing
at
all
to
do
this
type
which
we
have
thus
reached
by
our
imitativeness
we
now
have
fixed
upon
us
for
better
or
worse
now
no
type
can
be
disadvantageous
but
so
far
as
our
type
follows
the
fashion
it
can
not
be
wholly
good
clouston
was
certainly
right
in
thinking
that
eagerness
breathlessness
and
anxiety
are
not
signs
of
strength
they
are
signs
of
weakness
and
of
bad
the
even
forehead
the
cheek
the
codfish
eye
may
be
less
interesting
for
the
moment
but
they
are
more
promising
signs
than
intense
expression
is
of
what
we
may
expect
of
their
possessor
in
the
long
run
your
dull
unhurried
worker
gets
over
a
great
deal
of
ground
because
he
never
goes
backward
or
breaks
down
your
intense
convulsive
worker
breaks
down
and
has
bad
moods
so
often
that
you
never
know
where
he
may
be
when
you
most
need
his
help
he
may
be
having
one
of
his
days
we
say
that
so
many
of
our
collapse
and
have
to
be
sent
abroad
to
rest
their
nerves
because
they
work
so
hard
i
suspect
that
this
is
an
immense
mistake
i
suspect
that
neither
the
nature
nor
the
amount
of
our
work
is
accountable
for
the
frequency
and
severity
of
our
breakdowns
but
that
their
cause
lies
rather
in
those
absurd
feelings
of
hurry
and
having
no
time
in
that
breathlessness
and
tension
that
anxiety
of
feature
and
that
solicitude
for
results
that
lack
of
inner
harmony
and
ease
in
short
by
which
with
us
the
work
is
so
apt
to
be
accompanied
and
from
which
a
european
who
should
do
the
same
work
would
nine
times
out
of
ten
be
free
these
perfectly
wanton
and
unnecessary
tricks
of
inner
attitude
and
outer
manner
in
us
caught
from
the
social
atmosphere
kept
up
by
tradition
and
idealized
by
many
as
the
admirable
way
of
life
are
the
last
straws
that
break
the
american
camel
back
the
final
overflowers
of
our
measure
of
wear
and
tear
and
fatigue
the
voice
for
example
in
a
surprisingly
large
number
of
us
has
a
tired
and
plaintive
sound
some
of
us
are
really
tired
for
i
do
not
mean
absolutely
to
deny
that
our
climate
has
a
tiring
quality
but
far
more
of
us
are
not
tired
at
all
or
would
not
be
tired
at
all
unless
we
had
got
into
a
wretched
trick
of
feeling
tired
by
following
the
prevalent
habits
of
vocalization
and
expression
and
if
talking
high
and
tired
and
living
excitedly
and
hurriedly
would
only
enable
us
to
more
by
the
way
even
while
breaking
us
down
in
the
end
it
would
be
different
there
would
be
some
compensation
some
excuse
for
going
on
so
but
the
exact
reverse
is
the
case
it
is
your
relaxed
and
easy
worker
who
is
in
no
hurry
and
quite
thoughtless
most
of
the
while
of
consequences
who
is
your
efficient
worker
and
tension
and
anxiety
and
present
and
future
all
mixed
up
together
in
our
mind
at
once
are
the
surest
drags
upon
steady
progress
and
hindrances
to
our
success
my
colleague
professor
münsterberg
an
excellent
observer
who
came
here
recently
has
written
some
notes
on
america
to
german
papers
he
says
in
substance
that
the
appearance
of
unusual
energy
in
america
is
superficial
and
illusory
being
really
due
to
nothing
but
the
habits
of
jerkiness
and
bad
for
which
we
have
to
thank
the
defective
training
of
our
people
i
think
myself
that
it
is
high
time
for
old
legends
and
traditional
opinions
to
be
changed
and
that
if
any
one
should
begin
to
write
about
yankee
inefficiency
and
feebleness
and
inability
to
do
anything
with
time
except
to
waste
it
he
would
have
a
very
pretty
paradoxical
little
thesis
to
sustain
with
a
great
many
facts
to
quote
and
a
great
deal
of
experience
to
appeal
to
in
its
proof
well
my
friends
if
our
dear
american
character
is
weakened
by
all
this
and
i
think
whatever
reserves
you
may
make
that
you
will
agree
as
to
the
main
facts
where
does
the
remedy
lie
it
lies
of
course
where
lay
the
origins
of
the
disease
if
a
vicious
fashion
and
taste
are
to
blame
for
the
thing
the
fashion
and
taste
must
be
changed
and
though
it
is
no
small
thing
to
inoculate
seventy
millions
of
people
with
new
standards
yet
if
there
is
to
be
any
relief
that
will
have
to
be
done
we
must
change
ourselves
from
a
race
that
admires
jerk
and
snap
for
their
own
sakes
and
looks
down
upon
low
voices
and
quiet
ways
as
dull
to
one
that
on
the
contrary
has
calm
for
its
ideal
and
for
their
own
sakes
loves
harmony
dignity
and
ease
so
we
go
back
to
the
psychology
of
imitation
again
there
is
only
one
way
to
improve
ourselves
and
that
is
by
some
of
us
setting
an
example
which
the
others
may
pick
up
and
imitate
till
the
new
fashion
spreads
from
east
to
west
some
of
us
are
in
more
favorable
positions
than
others
to
set
new
fashions
some
are
much
more
striking
personally
and
imitable
so
to
speak
but
no
living
person
is
sunk
so
low
as
not
to
be
imitated
by
somebody
thackeray
somewhere
says
of
the
irish
nation
that
there
never
was
an
irishman
so
poor
that
he
did
have
a
still
poorer
irishman
living
at
his
expense
and
surely
there
is
no
human
being
whose
example
does
work
contagiously
in
particular
the
very
idiots
at
our
public
institutions
imitate
each
other
peculiarities
and
if
you
should
individually
achieve
calmness
and
harmony
in
your
own
person
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
a
wave
of
imitation
will
spread
from
you
as
surely
as
the
circles
spread
outward
when
a
stone
is
dropped
into
a
lake
fortunately
we
shall
not
have
to
be
absolute
pioneers
even
now
in
new
york
they
have
formed
a
society
for
the
improvement
of
our
national
vocalization
and
one
perceives
its
machinations
already
in
the
shape
of
various
newspaper
paragraphs
intended
to
stir
up
dissatisfaction
with
the
awful
thing
that
it
is
and
better
still
than
that
because
more
radical
and
general
is
the
gospel
of
relaxation
as
one
may
call
it
preached
by
miss
annie
payson
call
of
boston
in
her
admirable
little
volume
called
through
repose
a
book
that
ought
to
be
in
the
hands
of
every
teacher
and
student
in
america
of
either
sex
you
need
only
be
followers
then
on
a
path
already
opened
up
by
others
but
of
one
thing
be
confident
others
still
will
follow
you
and
this
brings
me
to
one
more
application
of
psychology
to
practical
life
to
which
i
will
call
attention
briefly
and
then
close
if
example
of
easy
and
calm
ways
is
to
be
effectively
contagious
one
feels
by
instinct
that
the
less
voluntarily
one
aims
at
getting
imitated
the
more
unconscious
one
keeps
in
the
matter
the
more
likely
one
is
to
succeed
the
imitable
and
you
may
then
discharge
your
minds
of
all
responsibility
for
the
imitation
the
laws
of
social
nature
will
take
care
of
that
result
now
the
psychological
principle
on
which
this
precept
reposes
is
a
law
of
very
deep
and
importance
in
the
conduct
of
our
lives
and
at
the
same
time
a
law
which
we
americans
most
grievously
neglect
stated
technically
the
law
is
this
that
feeling
about
one
self
tends
to
arrest
the
free
association
of
one
objective
ideas
and
motor
we
get
the
extreme
example
of
this
in
the
mental
disease
called
melancholia
a
melancholic
patient
is
filled
through
and
through
with
intensely
painful
emotion
about
himself
he
is
threatened
he
is
guilty
he
is
doomed
he
is
annihilated
he
is
lost
his
mind
is
fixed
as
if
in
a
cramp
on
these
feelings
of
his
own
situation
and
in
all
the
books
on
insanity
you
may
read
that
the
usual
varied
flow
of
his
thoughts
has
ceased
his
associative
processes
to
use
the
technical
phrase
are
inhibited
and
his
ideas
stand
shut
up
to
their
one
monotonous
function
of
reiterating
inwardly
the
fact
of
the
desperate
estate
and
this
inhibitive
influence
is
not
due
to
the
mere
fact
that
his
emotion
is
joyous
emotions
about
the
self
also
stop
the
association
of
our
ideas
a
saint
in
ecstasy
is
as
motionless
and
irresponsive
and
as
a
melancholiac
and
without
going
as
far
as
ecstatic
saints
we
know
how
in
every
one
a
great
or
sudden
pleasure
may
paralyze
the
flow
of
thought
ask
young
people
returning
from
a
party
or
a
spectacle
and
all
excited
about
it
what
it
was
oh
it
was
it
was
it
was
is
all
the
information
you
are
likely
to
receive
until
the
excitement
has
calmed
down
probably
every
one
of
my
hearers
has
been
made
temporarily
by
some
great
success
or
piece
of
good
fortune
good
good
is
all
we
can
at
such
times
say
to
ourselves
until
we
smile
at
our
own
very
foolishness
now
from
all
this
we
can
draw
an
extremely
practical
conclusion
if
namely
we
wish
our
trains
of
ideation
and
volition
to
be
copious
and
varied
and
effective
we
must
form
the
habit
of
freeing
them
from
the
inhibitive
influence
of
reflection
upon
them
of
egoistic
preoccupation
about
their
results
such
a
habit
like
other
habits
can
be
formed
prudence
and
duty
and
emotions
of
ambition
and
emotions
of
anxiety
have
of
course
a
needful
part
to
play
in
our
lives
but
confine
them
as
far
as
possible
to
the
occasions
when
you
are
making
your
general
resolutions
and
deciding
on
your
plans
of
campaign
and
keep
them
out
of
the
details
when
once
a
decision
is
reached
and
execution
is
the
order
of
the
day
dismiss
absolutely
all
responsibility
and
care
about
the
outcome
in
a
word
your
intellectual
and
practical
machinery
and
let
it
run
free
and
the
service
it
will
do
you
will
be
twice
as
good
who
are
the
scholars
who
get
in
the
those
who
think
of
the
possibilities
of
failure
and
feel
the
great
importance
of
the
act
who
are
those
who
do
recite
well
often
those
who
are
most
indifferent
ideas
reel
themselves
out
of
their
memory
of
their
own
accord
why
do
we
hear
the
complaint
so
often
that
social
life
in
new
england
is
either
less
rich
and
expressive
or
more
fatiguing
than
it
is
in
some
other
parts
of
the
world
to
what
is
the
fact
if
fact
it
be
due
unless
to
the
conscience
of
the
people
afraid
of
either
saying
something
too
trivial
and
obvious
or
something
insincere
or
something
unworthy
of
one
interlocutor
or
something
in
some
way
or
other
not
adequate
to
the
occasion
how
can
conversation
possibly
steer
itself
through
such
a
sea
of
responsibilities
and
inhibitions
as
this
on
the
other
hand
conversation
does
flourish
and
society
is
refreshing
and
neither
dull
on
the
one
hand
nor
exhausting
from
its
effort
on
the
other
wherever
people
forget
their
scruples
and
take
the
brakes
off
their
hearts
and
let
their
tongues
wag
as
automatically
and
irresponsibly
as
they
will
they
talk
much
in
pedagogic
circles
about
the
duty
of
the
teacher
to
prepare
for
every
lesson
in
advance
to
some
extent
this
is
useful
but
we
yankees
are
assuredly
not
those
to
whom
such
a
general
doctrine
should
be
preached
we
are
only
too
careful
as
it
is
the
advice
i
should
give
to
most
teachers
would
be
in
the
words
of
one
who
is
herself
an
admirable
teacher
prepare
yourself
in
the
so
well
that
it
shall
be
always
on
then
in
the
classroom
trust
your
spontaneity
and
fling
away
all
further
care
my
advice
to
students
especially
to
would
be
somewhat
similar
just
as
a
may
be
too
tight
so
may
carefulness
and
conscientiousness
be
so
tense
as
to
hinder
the
running
of
one
mind
take
for
example
periods
when
there
are
many
successive
days
of
examination
impending
one
ounce
of
good
nervous
tone
in
an
examination
is
worth
many
pounds
of
anxious
study
for
it
in
advance
if
you
want
really
to
do
your
best
in
an
examination
fling
away
the
book
the
day
before
say
to
yourself
i
wo
waste
another
minute
on
this
miserable
thing
and
i
do
care
an
iota
whether
i
succeed
or
not
say
this
sincerely
and
feel
it
and
go
out
and
play
or
go
to
bed
and
sleep
and
i
am
sure
the
results
next
day
will
encourage
you
to
use
the
method
permanently
i
have
heard
this
advice
given
to
a
student
by
miss
call
whose
book
on
muscular
relaxation
i
quoted
a
moment
ago
in
her
later
book
entitled
a
matter
of
course
the
gospel
of
moral
relaxation
of
dropping
things
from
the
mind
and
not
is
preached
with
equal
success
not
only
our
preachers
but
our
friends
the
theosophists
and
of
various
religious
sects
are
also
harping
on
this
string
and
with
the
doctors
the
delsarteans
the
various
sects
and
such
writers
as
dresser
prentice
mulford
horace
fletcher
and
trine
to
help
and
the
whole
band
of
schoolteachers
and
chiming
in
it
really
looks
as
if
a
good
start
might
be
made
in
the
direction
of
changing
our
american
mental
habit
into
something
more
indifferent
and
strong
worry
means
always
and
invariably
inhibition
of
associations
and
loss
of
effective
power
of
course
the
sovereign
cure
for
worry
is
religious
faith
and
this
of
course
you
also
know
the
turbulent
billows
of
the
fretful
surface
leave
the
deep
parts
of
the
ocean
undisturbed
and
to
him
who
has
a
hold
on
vaster
and
more
permanent
realities
the
hourly
vicissitudes
of
his
personal
destiny
seem
relatively
insignificant
things
the
really
religious
person
is
accordingly
unshakable
and
full
of
equanimity
and
calmly
ready
for
any
duty
that
the
day
may
bring
forth
this
is
charmingly
illustrated
by
a
little
work
with
which
i
recently
became
acquainted
the
practice
of
the
presence
of
god
the
best
ruler
of
a
holy
life
by
brother
lawrence
being
conversations
and
letters
of
nicholas
herman
of
lorraine
translated
from
the
french
c
i
extract
a
few
passages
the
conversations
being
given
in
indirect
discourse
brother
lawrence
was
a
carmelite
friar
converted
at
paris
in
he
said
that
he
had
been
footman
to
fieubert
the
treasurer
and
that
he
was
a
great
awkward
fellow
who
broke
everything
that
he
had
desired
to
be
received
into
a
monastery
thinking
that
he
would
there
be
made
to
smart
for
his
awkwardness
and
the
faults
he
should
commit
and
so
he
should
sacrifice
to
god
his
life
with
its
pleasures
but
that
god
had
disappointed
him
he
having
met
with
nothing
but
satisfaction
in
that
state
c
fleming
revell
company
new
york
that
he
had
long
been
troubled
in
mind
from
a
certain
belief
that
he
should
be
damned
that
all
the
men
in
the
world
could
not
have
persuaded
him
to
the
contrary
but
that
he
had
thus
reasoned
with
himself
about
it
engaged
in
a
religious
life
only
for
the
love
of
god
and
i
have
endeavored
to
act
only
for
him
whatever
becomes
of
me
whether
i
be
lost
or
saved
i
will
always
continue
to
act
purely
for
the
love
of
god
i
shall
have
this
good
at
least
that
till
death
i
shall
have
done
all
that
is
in
me
to
love
that
since
then
he
had
passed
his
life
in
perfect
liberty
and
continual
joy
that
when
an
occasion
of
practising
some
virtue
offered
he
addressed
himself
to
god
saying
i
can
not
do
this
unless
thou
enablest
me
and
that
then
he
received
strength
more
than
sufficient
that
when
he
had
failed
in
his
duty
he
only
confessed
his
fault
saying
to
god
shall
never
do
otherwise
if
you
leave
me
to
myself
it
is
you
who
must
hinder
my
failing
and
mend
what
is
amiss
that
after
this
he
gave
himself
no
further
uneasiness
about
it
that
he
had
been
lately
sent
into
burgundy
to
buy
the
provision
of
wine
for
the
society
which
was
a
very
unwelcome
task
for
him
because
he
had
no
turn
for
business
and
because
he
was
lame
and
could
not
go
about
the
boat
but
by
rolling
himself
over
the
casks
that
however
he
gave
himself
no
uneasiness
about
it
nor
about
the
purchase
of
the
wine
that
he
said
to
god
was
his
business
he
was
about
and
that
he
afterward
found
it
well
performed
that
he
had
been
sent
into
auvergne
the
year
before
upon
the
same
account
that
he
could
not
tell
how
the
matter
passed
but
that
it
proved
very
well
so
likewise
in
his
business
in
the
kitchen
to
which
he
had
naturally
a
great
aversion
having
accustomed
himself
to
do
everything
there
for
the
love
of
god
and
with
prayer
upon
all
occasions
for
his
grace
to
do
his
work
well
he
had
found
everything
easy
during
fifteen
years
that
he
had
been
employed
there
that
he
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
post
he
was
now
in
but
that
he
was
as
ready
to
quit
that
as
the
former
since
he
was
always
pleasing
himself
in
every
condition
by
doing
little
things
for
the
love
of
god
that
the
goodness
of
god
assured
him
he
would
not
forsake
him
utterly
and
that
he
would
give
him
strength
to
bear
whatever
evil
he
permitted
to
happen
to
him
and
therefore
that
he
feared
nothing
and
had
no
occasion
to
consult
with
anybody
about
his
state
that
when
he
had
attempted
to
do
it
he
had
always
come
away
more
perplexed
the
of
the
good
brother
lawrence
and
the
relaxation
of
all
unnecessary
solicitudes
and
anxieties
in
him
is
a
refreshing
spectacle
the
need
of
feeling
responsible
all
the
livelong
day
has
been
preached
long
enough
in
our
new
england
long
enough
exclusively
at
any
rate
and
long
enough
to
the
female
sex
what
our
and
most
need
nowadays
is
not
the
exacerbation
but
rather
the
of
their
moral
tensions
even
now
i
fear
that
some
one
of
my
fair
hearers
may
be
making
an
undying
resolve
to
become
strenuously
relaxed
cost
what
it
will
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
it
is
needless
to
say
that
that
is
not
the
way
to
do
it
the
way
to
do
it
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
is
genuinely
not
to
care
whether
you
are
doing
it
or
not
then
possibly
by
the
grace
of
god
you
may
all
at
once
find
that
you
doing
it
and
having
learned
what
the
trick
feels
like
you
may
again
by
the
grace
of
god
be
enabled
to
go
on
and
that
something
like
this
may
be
the
happy
experience
of
all
my
hearers
is
in
closing
my
most
earnest
wish
ii
on
a
certain
blindness
in
human
beings
our
judgments
concerning
the
worth
of
things
big
or
little
depend
on
the
the
things
arouse
in
us
where
we
judge
a
thing
to
be
precious
in
consequence
of
the
we
frame
of
it
this
is
only
because
the
idea
is
itself
associated
already
with
a
feeling
if
we
were
radically
feelingless
and
if
ideas
were
the
only
things
our
mind
could
entertain
we
should
lose
all
our
likes
and
dislikes
at
a
stroke
and
be
unable
to
point
to
any
one
situation
or
experience
in
life
more
valuable
or
significant
than
any
other
now
the
blindness
in
human
beings
of
which
this
discourse
will
treat
is
the
blindness
with
which
we
all
are
afflicted
in
regard
to
the
feelings
of
creatures
and
people
different
from
ourselves
we
are
practical
beings
each
of
us
with
limited
functions
and
duties
to
perform
each
is
bound
to
feel
intensely
the
importance
of
his
own
duties
and
the
significance
of
the
situations
that
call
these
forth
but
this
feeling
is
in
each
of
us
a
vital
secret
for
sympathy
with
which
we
vainly
look
to
others
the
others
are
too
much
absorbed
in
their
own
vital
secrets
to
take
an
interest
in
ours
hence
the
stupidity
and
injustice
of
our
opinions
so
far
as
they
deal
with
the
significance
of
alien
lives
hence
the
falsity
of
our
judgments
so
far
as
they
presume
to
decide
in
an
absolute
way
on
the
value
of
other
conditions
or
ideals
take
our
dogs
and
ourselves
connected
as
we
are
by
a
tie
more
intimate
than
most
ties
in
this
world
and
yet
outside
of
that
tie
of
friendly
fondness
how
insensible
each
of
us
to
all
that
makes
life
significant
for
the
other
we
to
the
rapture
of
bones
under
hedges
or
smells
of
trees
and
they
to
the
delights
of
literature
and
art
as
you
sit
reading
the
most
moving
romance
you
ever
fell
upon
what
sort
of
a
judge
is
your
of
your
behavior
with
all
his
good
will
toward
you
the
nature
of
your
conduct
is
absolutely
excluded
from
his
comprehension
to
sit
there
like
a
senseless
statue
when
you
might
be
taking
him
to
walk
and
throwing
sticks
for
him
to
catch
what
queer
disease
is
this
that
comes
over
you
every
day
of
holding
things
and
staring
at
them
like
that
for
hours
together
paralyzed
of
motion
and
vacant
of
all
conscious
life
the
african
savages
came
nearer
the
truth
but
they
too
missed
it
when
they
gathered
wonderingly
round
one
of
our
american
travellers
who
in
the
interior
had
just
come
into
possession
of
a
stray
copy
of
the
new
york
and
was
devouring
it
column
by
column
when
he
got
through
they
offered
him
a
high
price
for
the
mysterious
object
and
being
asked
for
what
they
wanted
it
they
said
for
an
eye
medicine
that
being
the
only
reason
they
could
conceive
of
for
the
protracted
bath
which
he
had
given
his
eyes
upon
its
surface
the
spectator
judgment
is
sure
to
miss
the
root
of
the
matter
and
to
possess
no
truth
the
subject
judged
knows
a
part
of
the
world
of
reality
which
the
judging
spectator
fails
to
see
knows
more
while
the
spectator
knows
less
and
wherever
there
is
conflict
of
opinion
and
difference
of
vision
we
are
bound
to
believe
that
the
truer
side
is
the
side
that
feels
the
more
and
not
the
side
that
feels
the
less
let
me
take
a
personal
example
of
the
kind
that
befalls
each
one
of
us
daily
some
years
ago
while
journeying
in
the
mountains
of
north
carolina
i
passed
by
a
large
number
of
as
they
call
them
there
or
heads
of
small
valleys
between
the
hills
which
had
been
newly
cleared
and
planted
the
impression
on
my
mind
was
one
of
unmitigated
squalor
the
settler
had
in
every
case
cut
down
the
more
manageable
trees
and
left
their
charred
stumps
standing
the
larger
trees
he
had
girdled
and
killed
in
order
that
their
foliage
should
not
cast
a
shade
he
had
then
built
a
log
cabin
plastering
its
chinks
with
clay
and
had
set
up
a
tall
zigzag
rail
fence
around
the
scene
of
his
havoc
to
keep
the
pigs
and
cattle
out
finally
he
had
irregularly
planted
the
intervals
between
the
stumps
and
trees
with
indian
corn
which
grew
among
the
chips
and
there
he
dwelt
with
his
wife
and
babes
an
axe
a
gun
a
few
utensils
and
some
pigs
and
chickens
feeding
in
the
woods
being
the
sum
total
of
his
possessions
the
forest
had
been
destroyed
and
what
had
it
out
of
existence
was
hideous
a
sort
of
ulcer
without
a
single
element
of
artificial
grace
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
nature
beauty
ugly
indeed
seemed
the
life
of
the
squatter
scudding
as
the
sailors
say
under
bare
poles
beginning
again
away
back
where
our
first
ancestors
started
and
by
hardly
a
single
item
the
better
off
for
all
the
achievements
of
the
intervening
generations
talk
about
going
back
to
nature
i
said
to
myself
oppressed
by
the
dreariness
as
i
drove
by
talk
of
a
country
life
for
one
old
age
and
for
one
children
never
thus
with
nothing
but
the
bare
ground
and
one
bare
hands
to
fight
the
battle
never
without
the
best
spoils
of
culture
woven
in
the
beauties
and
commodities
gained
by
the
centuries
are
sacred
they
are
our
heritage
and
birthright
no
modern
person
ought
to
be
willing
to
live
a
day
in
such
a
state
of
rudimentariness
and
denudation
then
i
said
to
the
mountaineer
who
was
driving
me
what
sort
of
people
are
they
who
have
to
make
these
new
clearings
all
of
us
he
replied
why
we
ai
happy
here
unless
we
are
getting
one
of
these
coves
under
cultivation
i
instantly
felt
that
i
had
been
losing
the
whole
inward
significance
of
the
situation
because
to
me
the
clearings
spoke
of
naught
but
denudation
i
thought
that
to
those
whose
sturdy
arms
and
obedient
axes
had
made
them
they
could
tell
no
other
story
but
when
looked
on
the
hideous
stumps
what
they
thought
of
was
personal
victory
the
chips
the
girdled
trees
and
the
vile
split
rails
spoke
of
honest
sweat
persistent
toil
and
final
reward
the
cabin
was
a
warrant
of
safety
for
self
and
wife
and
babes
in
short
the
clearing
which
to
me
was
a
mere
ugly
picture
on
the
retina
was
to
them
a
symbol
redolent
with
moral
memories
and
sang
a
very
pæan
of
duty
struggle
and
success
i
had
been
as
blind
to
the
peculiar
ideality
of
their
conditions
as
they
certainly
would
also
have
been
to
the
ideality
of
mine
had
they
had
a
peep
at
my
strange
indoor
academic
ways
of
life
at
cambridge
wherever
a
process
of
life
communicates
an
eagerness
to
him
who
lives
it
there
the
life
becomes
genuinely
significant
sometimes
the
eagerness
is
more
knit
up
with
the
motor
activities
sometimes
with
the
perceptions
sometimes
with
the
imagination
sometimes
with
reflective
thought
but
wherever
it
is
found
there
is
the
zest
the
tingle
the
excitement
of
reality
and
there
in
the
only
real
and
positive
sense
in
which
importance
ever
anywhere
can
be
robert
louis
stevenson
has
illustrated
this
by
a
case
drawn
from
the
sphere
of
the
imagination
in
an
essay
which
i
really
think
deserves
to
become
immortal
both
for
the
truth
of
its
matter
and
the
excellence
of
its
form
toward
the
end
of
september
stevenson
writes
when
was
drawing
near
and
the
nights
were
already
black
we
would
begin
to
sally
from
our
respective
villas
each
equipped
with
a
tin
lantern
the
thing
was
so
well
known
that
it
had
worn
a
rut
in
the
commerce
of
great
britain
and
the
grocers
about
the
due
time
began
to
garnish
their
windows
with
our
particular
brand
of
luminary
we
wore
them
buckled
to
the
waist
upon
a
cricket
belt
and
over
them
such
was
the
rigor
of
the
game
a
buttoned
they
smelled
noisomely
of
blistered
tin
they
never
burned
aright
though
they
would
always
burn
our
fingers
their
use
was
naught
the
pleasure
of
them
merely
fanciful
and
yet
a
boy
with
a
under
his
asked
for
nothing
more
the
fishermen
used
lanterns
about
their
boats
and
it
was
from
them
i
suppose
that
we
had
got
the
hint
but
theirs
were
not
nor
did
we
ever
play
at
being
fishermen
the
police
carried
them
at
their
belts
and
we
had
plainly
copied
them
in
that
yet
we
did
not
pretend
to
be
policemen
burglars
indeed
we
may
have
had
some
haunting
thought
of
and
we
had
certainly
an
eye
to
past
ages
when
lanterns
were
more
common
and
to
certain
in
which
we
had
found
them
to
figure
very
largely
but
take
it
for
all
in
all
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
was
substantive
and
to
be
a
boy
with
a
under
his
was
good
enough
for
us
when
two
of
these
asses
met
there
would
be
an
anxious
you
got
your
lantern
and
a
gratified
that
was
the
shibboleth
and
very
needful
too
for
as
it
was
the
rule
to
keep
our
glory
contained
none
could
recognize
a
unless
like
the
polecat
by
the
smell
four
or
five
would
sometimes
climb
into
the
belly
of
a
lugger
with
nothing
but
the
thwarts
above
them
for
the
cabin
was
usually
locked
or
chose
out
some
hollow
of
the
links
where
the
wind
might
whistle
overhead
then
the
coats
would
be
unbuttoned
and
the
discovered
and
in
the
chequering
glimmer
under
the
huge
windy
hall
of
the
night
and
cheered
by
a
rich
steam
of
toasting
tinware
these
fortunate
young
gentlemen
would
crouch
together
in
the
cold
sand
of
the
links
or
on
the
scaly
bilges
of
the
and
delight
them
with
inappropriate
talk
woe
is
me
that
i
can
not
give
some
specimens
but
the
talk
was
but
a
condiment
and
these
gatherings
themselves
only
accidents
in
the
career
of
the
the
essence
of
this
bliss
was
to
walk
by
yourself
in
the
black
night
the
slide
shut
the
buttoned
not
a
ray
escaping
whether
to
conduct
your
footsteps
or
to
make
your
glory
public
a
mere
pillar
of
darkness
in
the
dark
and
all
the
while
deep
down
in
the
privacy
of
your
fool
heart
to
know
you
had
a
at
your
belt
and
to
exult
and
sing
over
the
knowledge
it
is
said
that
a
poet
has
died
young
in
the
breast
of
the
most
stolid
it
may
be
contended
rather
that
a
somewhat
minor
bard
in
almost
every
case
survives
and
is
the
spice
of
life
to
his
possessor
justice
is
not
done
to
the
versatility
and
the
unplumbed
childishness
of
imagination
his
life
from
without
may
seem
but
a
rude
mound
of
mud
there
will
be
some
golden
chamber
at
the
heart
of
it
in
which
he
dwells
delighted
and
for
as
dark
as
his
pathway
seems
to
the
observer
he
will
have
some
kind
of
at
his
belt
there
is
one
fable
that
touches
very
near
the
quick
of
life
the
fable
of
the
monk
who
passed
into
the
woods
heard
a
bird
break
into
song
hearkened
for
a
trill
or
two
and
found
himself
at
his
return
a
stranger
at
his
convent
gates
for
he
had
been
absent
fifty
years
and
of
all
his
comrades
there
survived
but
one
to
recognize
him
it
is
not
only
in
the
woods
that
this
enchanter
carols
though
perhaps
he
is
native
there
he
sings
in
the
most
doleful
places
the
miser
hears
him
and
chuckles
and
his
days
are
moments
with
no
more
apparatus
than
an
lantern
i
have
evoked
him
on
the
naked
links
all
life
that
is
not
merely
mechanical
is
spun
out
of
two
strands
seeking
for
that
bird
and
hearing
him
and
it
is
just
this
that
makes
life
so
hard
to
value
and
the
delight
of
each
so
incommunicable
and
it
is
just
a
knowledge
of
this
and
a
remembrance
of
those
fortunate
hours
in
which
the
bird
sung
to
that
fills
us
with
such
wonder
when
we
turn
to
the
pages
of
the
realist
there
to
be
sure
we
find
a
picture
of
life
in
so
far
as
it
consists
of
mud
and
of
old
iron
cheap
desires
and
cheap
fears
that
which
we
are
ashamed
to
remember
and
that
which
we
are
careless
whether
we
forget
but
of
the
note
of
that
nightingale
we
hear
no
news
say
that
we
came
in
such
a
realistic
romance
on
some
such
business
as
that
of
my
on
the
links
and
described
the
boys
as
very
cold
spat
upon
by
flurries
of
rain
and
drearily
surrounded
all
of
which
they
were
and
their
talk
as
silly
and
indecent
which
it
certainly
was
to
the
eye
of
the
observer
they
wet
and
cold
and
drearily
surrounded
but
ask
themselves
and
they
are
in
the
heaven
of
a
recondite
pleasure
the
ground
of
which
is
an
lantern
for
to
repeat
the
ground
of
a
man
joy
is
often
hard
to
hit
it
may
hinge
at
times
upon
a
mere
accessory
like
the
lantern
it
may
reside
in
the
mysterious
inwards
of
psychology
it
has
so
little
bond
with
externals
that
it
may
even
touch
them
not
and
the
man
true
life
for
which
he
consents
to
live
lie
together
in
the
field
of
fancy
in
such
a
case
the
poetry
runs
underground
the
observer
poor
soul
with
his
documents
is
all
abroad
for
to
look
at
the
man
is
but
to
court
deception
we
shall
see
the
trunk
from
which
he
draws
his
nourishment
but
he
himself
is
above
and
abroad
in
the
green
dome
of
foliage
hummed
through
by
winds
and
nested
in
by
nightingales
and
the
true
realism
were
that
of
the
poets
to
climb
after
him
like
a
squirrel
and
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
heaven
in
which
he
lives
and
the
true
realism
always
and
everywhere
is
that
of
the
poets
to
find
out
where
joy
resides
and
give
it
a
voice
far
beyond
singing
for
to
miss
the
joy
is
to
miss
all
in
the
joy
of
the
actors
lies
the
sense
of
any
action
that
is
the
explanation
that
the
excuse
to
one
who
has
not
the
secret
of
the
lanterns
the
scene
upon
the
links
is
meaningless
and
hence
the
haunting
and
truly
spectral
unreality
of
realistic
books
in
each
we
miss
the
personal
poetry
the
enchanted
atmosphere
that
rainbow
work
of
fancy
that
clothes
what
is
naked
and
seems
to
ennoble
what
is
base
in
each
life
falls
dead
like
dough
instead
of
soaring
away
like
a
balloon
into
the
colors
of
the
sunset
each
is
true
each
inconceivable
for
no
man
lives
in
the
external
truth
among
salts
and
acids
but
in
the
warm
phantasmagoric
chamber
of
his
brain
with
the
painted
windows
and
the
storied
wall
d
d
in
the
volume
entitled
the
plains
abridged
in
the
quotation
these
paragraphs
are
the
best
thing
i
know
in
all
stevenson
to
miss
the
joy
is
to
miss
all
indeed
it
is
yet
we
are
but
finite
and
each
one
of
us
has
some
single
specialized
vocation
of
his
own
and
it
seems
as
if
energy
in
the
service
of
its
particular
duties
might
be
got
only
by
hardening
the
heart
toward
everything
unlike
them
our
deadness
toward
all
but
one
particular
kind
of
joy
would
thus
be
the
price
we
inevitably
have
to
pay
for
being
practical
creatures
only
in
some
pitiful
dreamer
some
philosopher
poet
or
romancer
or
when
the
common
practical
man
becomes
a
lover
does
the
hard
externality
give
way
and
a
gleam
of
insight
into
the
ejective
world
as
clifford
called
it
the
vast
world
of
inner
life
beyond
us
so
different
from
that
of
outer
seeming
illuminate
our
mind
then
the
whole
scheme
of
our
customary
values
gets
confounded
then
our
self
is
riven
and
its
narrow
interests
fly
to
pieces
then
a
new
centre
and
a
new
perspective
must
be
found
the
change
is
well
described
by
my
colleague
josiah
royce
what
then
is
our
neighbor
thou
hast
regarded
his
thought
his
feeling
as
somehow
different
from
thine
thou
hast
said
pain
in
him
is
not
like
a
pain
in
me
but
something
far
easier
to
bear
he
seems
to
thee
a
little
less
living
than
thou
his
life
is
dim
it
is
cold
it
is
a
pale
fire
beside
thy
own
burning
desires
so
dimly
and
by
instinct
hast
thou
lived
with
thy
neighbor
and
hast
known
him
not
being
blind
thou
hast
made
of
him
a
thing
no
self
at
all
have
done
with
this
illusion
and
simply
try
to
learn
the
truth
pain
is
pain
joy
is
joy
everywhere
even
as
in
thee
in
all
the
songs
of
the
forest
birds
in
all
the
cries
of
the
wounded
and
dying
struggling
in
the
power
in
the
boundless
sea
where
the
myriads
of
strive
and
die
amid
all
the
countless
hordes
of
savage
men
in
all
sickness
and
sorrow
in
all
exultation
and
hope
everywhere
from
the
lowest
to
the
noblest
the
same
conscious
burning
wilful
life
is
found
endlessly
manifold
as
the
forms
of
the
living
creatures
unquenchable
as
the
fires
of
the
sun
real
as
these
impulses
that
even
now
throb
in
thine
own
little
selfish
heart
lift
up
thy
eyes
behold
that
life
and
then
turn
away
and
forget
it
as
thou
canst
but
if
thou
hast
that
thou
hast
begun
to
know
thy
duty

religious
aspect

philosophy

abridged
this
higher
vision
of
an
inner
significance
in
what
until
then
we
had
realized
only
in
the
dead
external
way
often
comes
over
a
person
suddenly
and
when
it
does
so
it
makes
an
epoch
in
his
history
as
emerson
says
there
is
a
depth
in
those
moments
that
constrains
us
to
ascribe
more
reality
to
them
than
to
all
other
experiences
the
passion
of
love
will
shake
one
like
an
explosion
or
some
act
will
awaken
a
remorseful
compunction
that
hangs
like
a
cloud
over
all
one
later
day
this
mystic
sense
of
hidden
meaning
starts
upon
us
often
from
natural
things
i
take
this
passage
from
a
french
novel
that
had
some
vogue
in
its
day
paris
march
it
was
dark
and
rather
cold
i
was
gloomy
and
walked
because
i
had
nothing
to
do
i
passed
by
some
flowers
placed
upon
a
wall
a
jonquil
in
bloom
was
there
it
is
the
strongest
expression
of
desire
it
was
the
first
perfume
of
the
year
i
felt
all
the
happiness
destined
for
man
this
unutterable
harmony
of
souls
the
phantom
of
the
ideal
world
arose
in
me
complete
i
never
felt
anything
so
great
or
so
instantaneous
i
know
not
what
shape
what
analogy
what
secret
of
relation
it
was
that
made
me
see
in
this
flower
a
limitless
beauty
i
shall
never
enclose
in
a
conception
this
power
this
immensity
that
nothing
will
express
this
form
that
nothing
will
contain
this
ideal
of
a
better
world
which
one
feels
but
which
it
would
seem
that
nature
has
not

wordsworth
and
shelley
are
similarly
full
of
this
sense
of
a
limitless
significance
in
natural
things
in
wordsworth
it
was
a
somewhat
austere
and
moral
significance
a
cheer
to
every
natural
form
rock
fruit
or
flower
even
the
loose
stones
that
cover
the
highway
i
gave
a
moral
life
i
saw
them
feel
or
linked
them
to
some
feeling
the
great
mass
lay
bedded
in
some
quickening
soul
and
all
that
i
beheld
respired
with
inward
meaning
g
g
the
prelude
book
iii
authentic
tidings
of
invisible
things
just
what
this
hidden
presence
in
nature
was
which
wordsworth
so
rapturously
felt
and
in
the
light
of
which
he
lived
tramping
the
hills
for
days
together
the
poet
never
could
explain
logically
or
in
articulate
conceptions
yet
to
the
reader
who
may
himself
have
had
gleaming
moments
of
a
similar
sort
the
verses
in
which
wordsworth
simply
proclaims
the
fact
of
them
come
with
a
authority
magnificent
the
morning
rose
in
memorable
pomp
glorious
as
ere
i
had
beheld
in
front
the
sea
lay
laughing
at
a
distance
near
the
solid
mountains
shone
bright
as
the
clouds
drenched
in
empyrean
light
and
in
the
meadows
and
the
lower
grounds
was
all
the
sweetness
of
a
common
dawn
dews
vapors
and
the
melody
of
birds
and
laborers
going
forth
to
till
the
fields
ah
need
i
say
dear
friend
that
to
the
brim
my
heart
was
full
i
made
no
vows
but
vows
were
then
made
for
me
bond
unknown
to
me
was
given
that
i
should
be
else
sinning
greatly
a
dedicated
spirit
on
i
walked
in
thankful
blessedness
which
yet
survives
h

the
prelude
book
iv
as
wordsworth
walked
filled
with
his
strange
inner
joy
responsive
thus
to
the
secret
life
of
nature
round
about
him
his
rural
neighbors
tightly
and
narrowly
intent
upon
their
own
affairs
their
crops
and
lambs
and
fences
must
have
thought
him
a
very
insignificant
and
foolish
personage
it
surely
never
occurred
to
any
one
of
them
to
wonder
what
was
going
on
inside
of
or
what
it
might
be
worth
and
yet
that
inner
life
of
his
carried
the
burden
of
a
significance
that
has
fed
the
souls
of
others
and
fills
them
to
this
day
with
inner
joy
richard
jefferies
has
written
a
remarkable
autobiographic
document
entitled
the
story
of
my
heart
it
tells
in
many
pages
of
the
rapture
with
which
in
youth
the
sense
of
the
life
of
nature
filled
him
on
a
certain
he
says
i
was
utterly
alone
with
the
sun
and
the
earth
lying
down
on
the
grass
i
spoke
in
my
soul
to
the
earth
the
sun
the
air
and
the
distant
sea
far
beyond
sight
with
all
the
intensity
of
feeling
which
exalted
me
all
the
intense
communion
i
held
with
the
earth
the
sun
and
sky
the
stars
hidden
by
the
light
with
the
ocean
in
no
manner
can
the
thrilling
depth
of
these
feelings
be
written
with
these
i
prayed
as
if
they
were
the
keys
of
an
instrument
the
great
sun
burning
with
light
the
strong
earth
dear
earth
the
warm
sky
the
pure
air
the
thought
of
ocean
the
inexpressible
beauty
of
all
filled
me
with
a
rapture
an
ecstasy
an
inflatus
with
this
inflatus
too
i
prayed
the
prayer
this
was
in
itself
not
for
an
object
it
was
a
passion
i
hid
my
face
in
the
grass
i
was
wholly
prostrated
i
lost
myself
in
the
wrestle
i
was
rapt
and
carried
away
had
any
shepherd
accidentally
seen
me
lying
on
the
turf
he
would
only
have
thought
i
was
resting
a
few
minutes
i
made
no
outward
show
who
could
have
imagined
the
whirlwind
of
passion
that
was
going
on
in
me
as
i
reclined
there
i
i
boston
roberts
pp
surely
a
worthless
hour
of
life
when
measured
by
the
usual
standards
of
commercial
value
yet
in
what
other
of
value
can
the
preciousness
of
any
hour
made
precious
by
any
standard
consist
if
it
consist
not
in
feelings
of
excited
significance
like
these
engendered
in
some
one
by
what
the
hour
contains
yet
so
blind
and
dead
does
the
clamor
of
our
own
practical
interests
make
us
to
all
other
things
that
it
seems
almost
as
if
it
were
necessary
to
become
worthless
as
a
practical
being
if
one
is
to
hope
to
attain
to
any
breadth
of
insight
into
the
impersonal
world
of
worths
as
such
to
have
any
perception
of
life
meaning
on
a
large
objective
scale
only
your
mystic
your
dreamer
or
your
insolvent
tramp
or
loafer
can
afford
so
sympathetic
an
occupation
an
occupation
which
will
change
the
usual
standards
of
human
value
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
giving
to
foolishness
a
place
ahead
of
power
and
laying
low
in
a
minute
the
distinctions
which
it
takes
a
conventional
man
a
lifetime
to
build
up
you
may
be
a
prophet
at
this
rate
but
you
can
not
be
a
worldly
success
walt
whitman
for
instance
is
accounted
by
many
of
us
a
contemporary
prophet
he
abolishes
the
usual
human
distinctions
brings
all
conventionalisms
into
solution
and
loves
and
celebrates
hardly
any
human
attributes
save
those
elementary
ones
common
to
all
members
of
the
race
for
this
he
becomes
a
sort
of
ideal
tramp
a
rider
on
and
and
considered
either
practically
or
academically
a
worthless
unproductive
being
his
verses
are
but
ejaculations
things
mostly
without
subject
or
verb
a
succession
of
interjections
on
an
immense
scale
he
felt
the
human
crowd
as
rapturously
as
wordsworth
felt
the
mountains
felt
it
as
an
overpoweringly
significant
presence
simply
to
absorb
one
mind
in
which
should
be
business
sufficient
and
worthy
to
fill
the
days
of
a
serious
man
as
he
crosses
brooklyn
ferry
this
is
what
he
feels
below
me
i
watch
you
face
to
face
clouds
of
the
west
sun
there
half
an
hour
high
i
see
you
also
face
to
face
crowds
of
men
and
women
attired
in
the
usual
costumes
how
curious
you
are
to
me
on
the
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
that
cross
returning
home
are
more
curious
to
me
than
you
suppose
and
you
that
shall
cross
from
shore
to
shore
years
hence
are
more
to
me
and
more
in
my
meditations
than
you
might
suppose
others
will
enter
the
gates
of
the
ferry
and
cross
from
shore
to
shore
others
will
watch
the
run
of
the
others
will
see
the
shipping
of
manhattan
north
and
west
and
the
heights
of
brooklyn
to
the
south
and
east
others
will
see
the
islands
large
and
small
fifty
years
hence
others
will
see
them
as
they
cross
the
sun
half
an
hour
high
a
hundred
years
hence
or
ever
so
many
hundred
years
hence
others
will
see
them
will
enjoy
the
sunset
the
pouring
in
of
the
the
falling
back
to
the
sea
of
the
it
avails
not
neither
time
or
place
distance
avails
not
just
as
you
feel
when
you
look
on
the
river
and
sky
so
i
felt
just
as
any
of
you
is
one
of
a
living
crowd
i
was
one
of
a
crowd
just
as
you
are
refresh
by
the
gladness
of
the
river
and
the
bright
flow
i
was
refresh
just
as
you
stand
and
lean
on
the
rail
yet
hurry
with
the
swift
current
i
stood
yet
was
hurried
just
as
you
look
on
the
numberless
masts
of
ships
and
the
pipes
of
steamboats
i
looked
i
too
many
and
many
a
time
cross
the
river
the
sun
half
an
hour
high
i
watched
the
i
saw
them
high
in
the
air
with
motionless
wings
oscillating
their
bodies
i
saw
how
the
glistening
yellow
lit
up
parts
of
their
bodies
and
left
the
rest
in
strong
shadow
i
saw
the
circles
and
the
gradual
edging
toward
the
south
saw
the
white
sails
of
schooners
and
sloops
saw
the
ships
at
anchor
the
sailors
at
work
in
the
rigging
or
out
astride
the
spars
the
waves
in
the
twilight
the
ladled
cups
the
frolicsome
crests
and
glistening
the
stretch
afar
growing
dimmer
and
dimmer
the
gray
walls
of
the
granite
by
the
docks
on
the
neighboring
shores
the
fires
from
the
foundry
chimneys
burning
high
into
the
night
casting
their
flicker
of
black
into
the
clefts
of
streets
these
and
all
else
were
to
me
the

as
they
are

abridged
and
so
on
through
the
rest
of
a
divinely
beautiful
poem
and
if
you
wish
to
see
what
this
hoary
loafer
considered
the
most
worthy
way
of
profiting
by
life
opportunities
read
the
delicious
volume
of
his
letters
to
a
young
who
had
become
his
friend
new
york
it
is
splendid
here
this
forenoon
bright
and
cool
i
was
out
early
taking
a
short
walk
by
the
river
only
two
squares
from
where
i
live
shall
i
tell
you
about
my
life
just
to
fill
up
i
generally
spend
the
forenoon
in
my
room
writing
then
take
a
bath
fix
up
and
go
out
about
twelve
and
loafe
somewhere
or
call
on
someone
down
town
or
on
business
or
perhaps
if
it
is
very
pleasant
and
i
feel
like
it
ride
a
trip
with
some
driver
friend
on
broadway
from
street
to
bowling
green
three
miles
each
way
every
day
i
find
i
have
plenty
to
do
every
hour
is
occupied
with
something
you
know
it
is
a
never
ending
amusement
and
study
and
recreation
for
me
to
ride
a
couple
of
hours
on
a
pleasant
afternoon
on
a
broadway
stage
in
this
way
you
see
everything
as
you
pass
a
sort
of
living
endless
panorama
shops
and
splendid
buildings
and
great
windows
on
the
broad
sidewalks
crowds
of
women
richly
dressed
continually
passing
altogether
different
superior
in
style
and
looks
from
any
to
be
seen
anywhere
else
in
fact
a
perfect
stream
of
people
men
too
dressed
in
high
style
and
plenty
of
foreigners
and
then
in
the
streets
the
thick
crowd
of
carriages
stages
carts
hotel
and
private
coaches
and
in
fact
all
sorts
of
vehicles
and
many
first
class
teams
mile
after
mile
and
the
splendor
of
such
a
great
street
and
so
many
tall
ornamental
noble
buildings
many
of
them
of
white
marble
and
the
gayety
and
motion
on
every
side
you
will
not
wonder
how
much
attraction
all
this
is
on
a
fine
day
to
a
great
loafer
like
me
who
enjoys
so
much
seeing
the
busy
world
move
by
him
and
exhibiting
itself
for
his
amusement
while
he
takes
it
easy
and
just
looks
on
and
observes
k
k
calamus
boston
pp
truly
a
futile
way
of
passing
the
time
some
of
you
may
say
and
not
altogether
creditable
to
a
man
and
yet
from
the
deepest
point
of
view
who
knows
the
more
of
truth
and
who
knows
the
less
whitman
on
his
full
of
the
inner
joy
with
which
the
spectacle
inspires
him
or
you
full
of
the
disdain
which
the
futility
of
his
occupation
excites
when
your
ordinary
brooklynite
or
new
yorker
leading
a
life
replete
with
too
much
luxury
or
tired
and
careworn
about
his
personal
affairs
crosses
the
ferry
or
goes
up
broadway
fancy
does
not
thus
away
into
the
colors
of
the
sunset
as
did
whitman
nor
does
he
inwardly
realize
at
all
the
indisputable
fact
that
this
world
never
did
anywhere
or
at
any
time
contain
more
of
essential
divinity
or
of
eternal
meaning
than
is
embodied
in
the
fields
of
vision
over
which
his
eyes
so
carelessly
pass
there
is
life
and
there
a
step
away
is
death
there
is
the
only
kind
of
beauty
there
ever
was
there
is
the
old
human
struggle
and
its
fruits
together
there
is
the
text
and
the
sermon
the
real
and
the
ideal
in
one
but
to
the
jaded
and
unquickened
eye
it
is
all
dead
and
common
pure
vulgarism
flatness
and
disgust
hech
it
is
a
sad
sight
says
carlyle
walking
at
night
with
some
one
who
appeals
to
him
to
note
the
splendor
of
the
stars
and
that
very
repetition
of
the
scene
to
new
generations
of
men
in
that
eternal
recurrence
of
the
common
order
which
so
fills
a
whitman
with
mystic
satisfaction
is
to
a
schopenhauer
with
the
emotional
anæsthesia
the
feeling
of
inner
emptiness
from
out
of
which
he
views
it
all
the
chief
ingredient
of
the
tedium

the

recurrent
inanities
the

barking

same

buzzing
forevermore
yet
of
the
kind
of

of
which
such
inanities

is
the
material
woven
of
all
the
excitements
joys
and
meanings
that
ever
were
or
ever
shall
be
in
this
world
to
be
rapt
with
satisfied
attention
like
whitman
to
the
mere
spectacle
of
the
world
presence
is
one
way
and
the
most
fundamental
way
of
confessing
one
sense
of
its
unfathomable
significance
and
importance
but
how
can
one
attain
to
the
feeling
of
the
vital
significance
of
an
experience
if
one
have
it
not
to
begin
with
there
is
no
receipt
which
one
can
follow
being
a
secret
and
a
mystery
it
often
comes
in
mysteriously
unexpected
ways
it
blossoms
sometimes
from
out
of
the
very
grave
wherein
we
imagined
that
our
happiness
was
buried
benvenuto

his

his

turn
to
god
as
they
have
never
turned
before
he
gets
a

which
he
reads
during
the
one
hour
in
the
in
which
a
wandering
ray
of
daylight
penetrates
his

he
has
religious

he
sings
psalms

composes

and
thinking
on

the

to
be

in

during

he
is
taken

and
dragged
through
much
of

retreat
cold
vermin
hunger
and
every
form
of
misery
assail
him
the
result
being
a
revelation
to
him
of
the
real
scale

life
values
here
only
and
for
the
first
time
he
appreciated
because
he
was
deprived
of

the
happiness
of
eating
when
he
was
hungry
of
drinking
when
he
was
thirsty
of
sleeping
when
he
was
sleepy
and
of
talking
when
he
felt
the
desire
to
exchange
some
words
later
in
life
he
always
recurred
with
joy
to
this
month
of
captivity
and
never
failed
to
speak
with
enthusiasm
of
the
powerful
and
ineffaceable
sensations
and
especially
of
the
moral
calm
which
he
had
experienced
at
this
epoch
when
at
daybreak
on
the
morrow
of
his
imprisonment
he
saw
i
abridge

the
mountains
with
their
wooded
slopes
disappearing
in
the
grayish
mist
when
he
felt
the
cool
breeze
caress
him
when
he
saw
the
light
drive
away
the
vapors
and
the
sun
rise
majestically
behind
the
clouds
and
cupolas
and
the
crosses
the
dew
the
distance
the
river
sparkle
in
the
splendid
cheerful
rays
his
heart
overflowed
with
emotion
this
emotion
kept
continually
with
him
and
increased
a
as
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
grew
graver
he
learnt
that
man
is
meant
for
happiness
and
that
this
happiness
is
in
him
in
the
satisfaction
of
the
daily
needs
of
existence
and
that
unhappiness
is
the
fatal
result
not
of
our
need
but
of
our
abundance
when
calm
reigned
in
the
camp
and
the
embers
paled
and
little
by
little
went
out
the
full
moon
had
reached
the
zenith
the
woods
and
the
fields
roundabout
lay
clearly
visible
and
beyond
the
inundation
of
light
which
filled
them
the
view
plunged
into
the
limitless
horizon
then
peter
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
firmament
filled
at
that
hour
with
myriads
of
stars
that
is
mine
he
thought
that
is
in
me
is
me
and
that
is
what
they
think
they
have
taken
prisoner
that
is
what
they
have
shut
up
in
a
cabin
so
he
smiled
and
turned
in
to
sleep

the
occasion
and
the

then
are
nothing

all
depends
on
the

of
the
soul

be

i
am
glad
to
the
brink
of
fear
life
is
always
worth
living
if
one
have
such
responsive
sensibilities
but
we
of
the
highly
educated
classes
so
called
have
most
of
us
got
far
far
away
from
nature
we
are
trained
to
seek
the
choice
the
rare
the
exquisite
exclusively
and
to
overlook
the
common
we
are
stuffed
with
abstract
conceptions
and
glib
with
verbalities
and
verbosities
and
in
the
culture
of
these
higher
functions
the
peculiar
sources
of
joy
connected
with
our
simpler
functions
often
dry
up
and
we
grow
and
insensible
to
life
more
elementary
and
general
goods
and
joys
the
remedy
under
such
conditions
is
to
descend
to
a
more
profound
and
primitive
level
to
be
imprisoned
or
shipwrecked
or
forced
into
the
army
would
permanently
show
the
good
of
life
to
many
an
pessimist
living
in
the
open

on
the
ground
the

of
the
balance
slowly
rises

and
the
and
insensibilities
even
themselves
out
the
good
of
all
the
artificial
schemes
and
fevers
fades
and
pales
and
that
of
seeing
smelling
tasting
sleeping
and
daring
and
doing
with
body
grows
and
grows
the
savages
and
children
of
nature
to
whom
we
deem
ourselves
so
much
superior
certainly
are
alive
where
we
are
often
dead
along
these
lines
and
could
they
write
as
glibly
as
we
do
they
would
read
us
impressive
lectures
on
our
impatience
for
improvement
and
on
our
blindness
to
the
fundamental
static
goods
of
life

my
brother
said

his

wilt

plough
another

if

were

them
plough
by

quoted
by

ii
the
intense
interest
that
life
can
assume
when
brought
down
to
the
level
the
level
of
pure
sensorial
perception
has
been
beautifully
described
by
a
man
who
write
hudson
in
his
volume
idle
days
in
patagonia
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
one
winter
says
this
admirable
author
at
a
point
on
the
rio
negro
seventy
or
eighty
miles
from
the
sea
it
was
my
custom
to
go
out
every
morning
on
horseback
with
my
gun
and
followed
by
one
dog
to
ride
away
from
the
valley
and
no
sooner
would
i
climb
the
terrace
and
plunge
into
the
gray
universal
thicket
than
i
would
find
myself
as
completely
alone
as
if
five
hundred
instead
of
only
five
miles
separated
me
from
the
valley
and
river
so
wild
and
solitary
and
remote
seemed
that
gray
waste
stretching
away
into
infinitude
a
waste
untrodden
by
man
and
where
the
wild
animals
are
so
few
that
they
have
made
no
discoverable
path
in
the
wilderness
of
thorns
not
once
nor
twice
nor
thrice
but
day
after
day
i
returned
to
this
solitude
going
to
it
in
the
morning
as
if
to
attend
a
festival
and
leaving
it
only
when
hunger
and
thirst
and
the
westering
sun
compelled
me
and
yet
i
had
no
object
in
going
no
motive
which
could
be
put
into
words
for
although
i
carried
a
gun
there
was
nothing
to
shoot
the
shooting
was
all
left
behind
in
the
valley
sometimes
i
would
pass
a
whole
day
without
seeing
one
mammal
and
perhaps
not
more
than
a
dozen
birds
of
any
size
the
weather
at
that
time
was
cheerless
generally
with
a
gray
film
of
cloud
spread
over
the
sky
and
a
bleak
wind
often
cold
enough
to
make
my
quite
numb
at
a
slow
pace
which
would
have
seemed
intolerable
under
other
circumstances
i
would
ride
about
for
hours
together
at
a
stretch
on
arriving
at
a
hill
i
would
slowly
ride
to
its
summit
and
stand
there
to
survey
the
prospect
on
every
side
it
stretched
away
in
great
undulations
wild
and
irregular
how
gray
it
all
was
hardly
less
so
near
at
hand
than
on
the
horizon
where
the
hills
were
dim
and
the
outline
obscured
by
distance
descending
from
my
outlook
i
would
take
up
my
aimless
wanderings
again
and
visit
other
elevations
to
gaze
on
the
same
landscape
from
another
point
and
so
on
for
hours
and
at
noon
i
would
dismount
and
sit
or
lie
on
my
folded
poncho
for
an
hour
or
longer
one
day
in
these
rambles
i
discovered
a
small
grove
composed
of
twenty
or
thirty
trees
growing
at
a
convenient
distance
apart
that
had
evidently
been
resorted
to
by
a
herd
of
deer
or
other
wild
animals
this
grove
was
on
a
hill
differing
in
shape
from
other
hills
in
its
neighborhood
and
after
a
time
i
made
a
point
of
finding
and
using
it
as
a
every
day
at
noon
i
did
not
ask
myself
why
i
made
choice
of
that
one
spot
sometimes
going
out
of
my
way
to
sit
there
instead
of
sitting
down
under
any
one
of
the
millions
of
trees
and
bushes
on
any
other
hillside
i
thought
nothing
about
it
but
acted
unconsciously
only
afterward
it
seemed
to
me
that
after
having
rested
there
once
each
time
i
wished
to
rest
again
the
wish
came
associated
with
the
image
of
that
particular
clump
of
trees
with
polished
stems
and
clean
bed
of
sand
beneath
and
in
a
short
time
i
formed
a
habit
of
returning
animal
like
to
repose
at
that
same
spot
it
was
perhaps
a
mistake
to
say
that
i
would
sit
down
and
rest
since
i
was
never
tired
and
yet
without
being
tired
that
pause
during
which
i
sat
for
an
hour
without
moving
was
strangely
grateful
all
day
there
would
be
no
sound
not
even
the
rustling
of
a
leaf
one
day
while
to
the
silence
it
occurred
to
my
mind
to
wonder
what
the
effect
would
be
if
i
were
to
shout
aloud
this
seemed
at
the
time
a
horrible
suggestion
which
almost
made
me
shudder
but
during
those
solitary
days
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
any
thought
to
cross
my
mind
in
the
state
of
mind
i
was
in
thought
had
become
impossible
my
state
was
one
of
and
yet
i
had
no
expectation
of
meeting
an
adventure
and
felt
as
free
from
apprehension
as
i
feel
now
while
sitting
in
a
room
in
london
the
state
seemed
familiar
rather
than
strange
and
accompanied
by
a
strong
feeling
of
elation
and
i
did
not
know
that
something
had
come
between
me
and
my
intellect
until
i
returned
to
my
former
self
to
thinking
and
the
old
insipid
existence
again
i
had
undoubtedly
and
that
state
of
intense
watchfulness
or
alertness
rather
with
suspension
of
the
higher
intellectual
faculties
represented
the
mental
state
of
the
pure
savage
he
thinks
little
reasons
little
having
a
surer
guide
in
his
mere
sensory
perceptions
he
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
nature
and
is
nearly
on
a
level
mentally
with
the
wild
animals
he
preys
on
and
which
in
their
turn
sometimes
prey
on
him
o
o
pp
abridged
for
the
spectator
such
hours
as
hudson
writes
of
form
a
mere
tale
of
emptiness
in
which
nothing
happens
nothing
is
gained
and
there
is
nothing
to
describe
they
are
meaningless
and
vacant
tracts
of
time
to
him
who
feels
their
inner
secret
they
tingle
with
an
importance
that
unutterably
vouches
for
itself
i
am
sorry
for
the
boy
or
girl
or
man
or
woman
who
has
never
been
touched
by
the
spell
of
this
mysterious
sensorial
life
with
its
irrationality
if
so
you
like
to
call
it
but
its
vigilance
and
its
supreme
felicity
the
holidays
of
life
are
its
most
vitally
significant
portions
because
they
are
or
at
least
should
be
covered
with
just
this
kind
of
magically
irresponsible
spell
and
now
what
is
the
result
of
all
these
considerations
and
quotations
it
is
negative
in
one
sense
but
positive
in
another
it
absolutely
forbids
us
to
be
forward
in
pronouncing
on
the
meaninglessness
of
forms
of
existence
other
than
our
own
and
it
commands
us
to
tolerate
respect
and
indulge
those
whom
we
see
harmlessly
interested
and
happy
in
their
own
ways
however
unintelligible
these
may
be
to
us
hands
off
neither
the
whole
of
truth
nor
the
whole
of
good
is
revealed
to
any
single
observer
although
each
observer
gains
a
partial
superiority
of
insight
from
the
peculiar
position
in
which
he
stands
even
prisons
and
have
their
special
revelations
it
is
enough
to
ask
of
each
of
us
that
he
should
be
faithful
to
his
own
opportunities
and
make
the
most
of
his
own
blessings
without
presuming
to
regulate
the
rest
of
the
vast
field
iii
what
makes
a
life
significant
in
my
previous
talk
a
certain
blindness
i
tried
to
make
you
feel
how
soaked
and
life
is
with
values
and
meanings
which
we
fail
to
realize
because
of
our
external
and
insensible
point
of
view
the
meanings
are
there
for
the
others
but
they
are
not
there
for
us
there
lies
more
than
a
mere
interest
of
curious
speculation
in
understanding
this
it
has
the
most
tremendous
practical
importance
i
wish
that
i
could
convince
you
of
it
as
i
feel
it
myself
it
is
the
basis
of
all
our
tolerance
social
religious
and
political
the
forgetting
of
it
lies
at
the
root
of
every
stupid
and
sanguinary
mistake
that
rulers
over
make
the
first
thing
to
learn
in
intercourse
with
others
is
with
their
own
peculiar
ways
of
being
happy
provided
those
ways
do
not
assume
to
interfere
by
violence
with
ours
no
one
has
insight
into
all
the
ideals
no
one
should
presume
to
judge
them
the
pretension
to
dogmatize
about
them
in
each
other
is
the
root
of
most
human
injustices
and
cruelties
and
the
trait
in
human
character
most
likely
to
make
the
angels
weep
every
jack
sees
in
his
own
particular
jill
charms
and
perfections
to
the
enchantment
of
which
we
stolid
onlookers
are
and
which
has
the
superior
view
of
the
absolute
truth
he
or
we
which
has
the
more
vital
insight
into
the
nature
of
jill
existence
as
a
fact
is
he
in
excess
being
in
this
matter
a
maniac
or
are
we
in
defect
being
victims
of
a
pathological
anæsthesia
as
regards
jill
magical
importance
surely
the
latter
surely
to
jack
are
the
profounder
truths
revealed
surely
poor
jill
palpitating
little
among
the
wonders
of
creation
worthy
of
this
sympathetic
interest
and
it
is
to
our
shame
that
the
rest
of
us
can
not
feel
like
jack
for
jack
realizes
jill
concretely
and
we
do
not
he
struggles
toward
a
union
with
her
inner
life
divining
her
feelings
anticipating
her
desires
understanding
her
limits
as
manfully
as
he
can
and
yet
inadequately
too
for
he
is
also
afflicted
with
some
blindness
even
here
whilst
we
dead
clods
that
we
are
do
not
even
seek
after
these
things
but
are
contented
that
that
portion
of
eternal
fact
named
jill
should
be
for
us
as
if
it
were
not
jill
who
knows
her
inner
life
knows
that
jack
way
of
taking
it
so
importantly
is
the
true
and
serious
way
and
she
responds
to
the
truth
in
him
by
taking
him
truly
and
seriously
too
may
the
ancient
blindness
never
wrap
its
clouds
about
either
of
them
again
where
would
any
of
be
were
there
no
one
willing
to
know
us
as
we
really
are
or
ready
to
repay
us
for
insight
by
making
recognizant
return
we
ought
all
of
us
to
realize
each
other
in
this
intense
pathetic
and
important
way
if
you
say
that
this
is
absurd
and
that
we
can
not
be
in
love
with
everyone
at
once
i
merely
point
out
to
you
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
certain
persons
do
exist
with
an
enormous
capacity
for
friendship
and
for
taking
delight
in
other
people
lives
and
that
such
persons
know
more
of
truth
than
if
their
hearts
were
not
so
big
the
vice
of
ordinary
jack
and
jill
affection
is
not
its
intensity
but
its
exclusions
and
its
jealousies
leave
those
out
and
you
see
that
the
ideal
i
am
holding
up
before
you
however
impracticable
yet
contains
nothing
intrinsically
absurd
we
have
unquestionably
a
great
of
ancestral
blindness
weighing
down
upon
us
only
transiently
riven
here
and
there
by
fitful
revelations
of
the
truth
it
is
vain
to
hope
for
this
state
of
things
to
alter
much
our
inner
secrets
must
remain
for
the
most
part
impenetrable
by
others
for
beings
as
essentially
practical
as
we
are
are
necessarily
short
of
sight
but
if
we
can
not
gain
much
positive
insight
into
one
another
can
not
we
at
least
use
our
sense
of
our
own
blindness
to
make
us
more
cautious
in
going
over
the
dark
places
can
not
we
escape
some
of
those
hideous
ancestral
intolerances
and
cruelties
and
positive
reversals
of
the
truth
for
the
remainder
of
this
hour
i
invite
you
to
seek
with
me
some
principle
to
make
our
tolerance
less
chaotic
and
as
i
began
my
previous
lecture
by
a
personal
reminiscence
i
am
going
to
ask
your
indulgence
for
a
similar
bit
of
egotism
now
a
few
summers
ago
i
spent
a
happy
week
at
the
famous
assembly
grounds
on
the
borders
of
chautauqua
lake
the
moment
one
treads
that
sacred
enclosure
one
feels
one
self
in
an
atmosphere
of
success
sobriety
and
industry
intelligence
and
goodness
orderliness
and
ideality
prosperity
and
cheerfulness
pervade
the
air
it
is
a
serious
and
studious
picnic
on
a
gigantic
scale
here
you
have
a
town
of
many
thousands
of
inhabitants
beautifully
laid
out
in
the
forest
and
drained
and
equipped
with
means
for
satisfying
all
the
necessary
lower
and
most
of
the
superfluous
higher
wants
of
man
you
have
a
college
in
full
blast
you
have
magnificent
music
a
chorus
of
seven
hundred
voices
with
possibly
the
most
perfect
auditorium
in
the
world
you
have
every
sort
of
athletic
exercise
from
sailing
rowing
swimming
bicycling
to
the
and
the
more
artificial
doings
which
the
gymnasium
affords
you
have
kindergartens
and
model
secondary
schools
you
have
general
religious
services
and
special
for
the
several
sects
you
have
perpetually
running
fountains
and
daily
popular
lectures
by
distinguished
men
you
have
the
best
of
company
and
yet
no
effort
you
have
no
zymotic
diseases
no
poverty
no
drunkenness
no
crime
no
police
you
have
culture
you
have
kindness
you
have
cheapness
you
have
equality
you
have
the
best
fruits
of
what
mankind
has
fought
and
bled
and
striven
for
tinder
the
name
of
civilization
for
centuries
you
have
in
short
a
foretaste
of
what
human
society
might
be
were
it
all
in
the
light
with
no
suffering
and
no
dark
corners
i
went
in
curiosity
for
a
day
i
stayed
for
a
week
held
by
the
charm
and
ease
of
everything
by
the
paradise
without
a
sin
without
a
victim
without
a
blot
without
a
tear
and
yet
what
was
my
own
astonishment
on
emerging
into
the
dark
and
wicked
world
again
to
catch
myself
quite
unexpectedly
and
involuntarily
saying
ouf
what
a
relief
now
for
something
primordial
and
savage
even
though
it
were
as
bad
as
an
armenian
massacre
to
set
the
balance
straight
again
this
order
is
too
tame
this
culture
too
this
goodness
too
uninspiring
this
human
drama
without
a
villain
or
a
pang
this
community
so
refined
that
is
the
utmost
offering
it
can
make
to
the
brute
animal
in
man
this
city
simmering
in
the
tepid
lakeside
sun
this
atrocious
harmlessness
of
all
things
i
can
not
abide
with
them
let
me
take
my
chances
again
in
the
big
outside
worldly
wilderness
with
all
its
sins
and
sufferings
there
are
the
heights
and
depths
the
precipices
and
the
steep
ideals
the
gleams
of
the
awful
and
the
infinite
and
there
is
more
hope
and
help
a
thousand
times
than
in
this
dead
level
and
quintessence
of
every
mediocrity
such
was
the
sudden
performed
for
me
by
my
lawless
fancy
there
had
been
spread
before
me
the
realization
on
a
small
sample
scale
of
course
of
all
the
ideals
for
which
our
civilization
has
been
striving
security
intelligence
humanity
and
order
and
here
was
the
instinctive
hostile
reaction
not
of
the
natural
man
but
of
a
cultivated
man
upon
such
a
utopia
there
seemed
thus
to
be
a
and
paradox
somewhere
which
i
as
a
professor
drawing
a
full
salary
was
in
duty
bound
to
unravel
and
explain
if
i
could
so
i
meditated
and
first
of
all
i
asked
myself
what
the
thing
was
that
was
so
lacking
in
this
sabbatical
city
and
the
lack
of
which
kept
one
forever
falling
short
of
the
higher
sort
of
contentment
and
i
soon
recognized
that
it
was
the
element
that
gives
to
the
wicked
outer
world
all
its
moral
style
expressiveness
and
picturesqueness
the
element
of
precipitousness
so
to
call
it
of
strength
and
strenuousness
intensity
and
danger
what
excites
and
interests
the
at
life
what
the
romances
and
the
statues
celebrate
and
the
grim
civic
monuments
remind
us
of
is
the
everlasting
battle
of
the
powers
of
light
with
those
of
darkness
with
heroism
reduced
to
its
bare
chance
yet
ever
and
anon
snatching
victory
from
the
jaws
of
death
but
in
this
unspeakable
chautauqua
there
was
no
potentiality
of
death
in
sight
anywhere
and
no
point
of
the
compass
visible
from
which
danger
might
possibly
appear
the
ideal
was
so
completely
victorious
already
that
no
sign
of
any
previous
battle
remained
the
place
just
resting
on
its
oars
but
what
our
human
emotions
seem
to
require
is
the
sight
of
the
struggle
going
on
the
moment
the
fruits
are
being
merely
eaten
things
become
ignoble
sweat
and
effort
human
nature
strained
to
its
uttermost
and
on
the
rack
yet
getting
through
alive
and
then
turning
its
back
on
its
success
to
pursue
another
more
rare
and
arduous
still
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
the
presence
of
which
inspires
us
and
the
reality
of
which
it
seems
to
be
the
function
of
all
the
higher
forms
of
literature
and
fine
art
to
bring
home
to
us
and
suggest
at
chautauqua
there
were
no
racks
even
in
the
place
historical
museum
and
no
sweat
except
possibly
the
gentle
moisture
on
the
brow
of
some
lecturer
or
on
the
sides
of
some
player
in
the
such
absence
of
human
nature
anywhere
seemed
then
a
sufficient
explanation
for
chautauqua
flatness
and
lack
of
zest
but
was
not
this
a
paradox
well
calculated
to
fill
one
with
dismay
it
looks
indeed
thought
i
as
if
the
romantic
idealists
with
their
pessimism
about
our
civilization
were
after
all
quite
right
an
irremediable
flatness
is
coming
over
the
world
bourgeoisie
and
mediocrity
church
sociables
and
teachers
conventions
are
taking
the
place
of
the
old
heights
and
depths
and
romantic
chiaroscuro
and
to
get
human
life
in
its
wild
intensity
we
must
in
future
turn
more
and
more
away
from
the
actual
and
forget
it
if
we
can
in
the
or
the
poet
pages
the
whole
world
delightful
and
sinful
as
it
may
still
appear
for
a
moment
to
one
just
escaped
from
the
chautauquan
enclosure
is
nevertheless
obeying
more
and
more
just
those
ideals
that
are
sure
to
make
of
it
in
the
end
a
mere
chautauqua
assembly
on
an
enormous
scale
im
gesang
soll
leben
muss
im
leben
even
now
in
our
own
country
correctness
fairness
and
compromise
for
every
small
advantage
are
crowding
out
all
other
qualities
the
higher
heroisms
and
the
old
rare
flavors
are
passing
out
of
life
p
p
this
address
was
composed
before
the
cuban
and
philippine
wars
such
outbursts
of
the
passion
of
mastery
are
however
only
episodes
in
a
social
process
which
in
the
long
run
seems
everywhere
tending
toward
the
chautauquan
ideals
with
these
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
was
speeding
with
the
train
toward
buffalo
when
near
that
city
the
sight
of
a
workman
doing
something
on
the
dizzy
edge
of
a
iron
construction
brought
me
to
my
senses
very
suddenly
and
now
i
perceived
by
a
flash
of
insight
that
i
had
been
steeping
myself
in
pure
ancestral
blindness
and
looking
at
life
with
the
eyes
of
a
remote
spectator
wishing
for
heroism
and
the
spectacle
of
human
nature
on
the
rack
i
had
never
noticed
the
great
fields
of
heroism
lying
round
about
me
i
had
failed
to
see
it
present
and
alive
i
could
only
think
of
it
as
dead
and
embalmed
labelled
and
costumed
as
it
is
in
the
pages
of
romance
and
yet
there
it
was
before
me
in
the
daily
lives
of
the
laboring
classes
not
in
clanging
fights
and
desperate
marches
only
is
heroism
to
be
looked
for
but
on
every
railway
bridge
and
building
that
is
going
up
on
on
the
decks
of
vessels
in
and
mines
on
among
the
firemen
and
the
policemen
the
demand
for
courage
is
incessant
and
the
supply
never
fails
there
every
day
of
the
year
somewhere
is
human
nature
for
you
and
wherever
a
scythe
an
axe
a
pick
or
a
shovel
is
wielded
you
have
it
sweating
and
aching
and
with
its
powers
of
patient
endurance
racked
to
the
utmost
under
the
length
of
hours
of
the
strain
as
i
awoke
to
all
this
unidealized
heroic
life
around
me
the
scales
seemed
to
fall
from
my
eyes
and
a
wave
of
sympathy
greater
than
anything
i
had
ever
before
felt
with
the
common
life
of
common
men
began
to
fill
my
soul
it
began
to
seem
as
if
virtue
with
horny
hands
and
dirty
skin
were
the
only
virtue
genuine
and
vital
enough
to
take
account
of
every
other
virtue
poses
none
is
absolutely
unconscious
and
simple
and
unexpectant
of
decoration
or
recognition
like
this
these
are
our
soldiers
thought
i
these
our
sustainers
these
the
very
parents
of
our
life
many
years
ago
when
in
vienna
i
had
had
a
similar
feeling
of
awe
and
reverence
in
looking
at
the
in
from
the
country
on
their
business
at
the
market
for
the
day
old
hags
many
of
them
were
dried
and
brown
and
wrinkled
kerchiefed
and
with
thick
wool
stockings
on
their
bony
shanks
stumping
through
the
glittering
thoroughfares
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
bent
on
duty
envying
nothing
remote
and
yet
at
bottom
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
bearing
the
whole
fabric
of
the
splendors
and
corruptions
of
that
city
on
their
laborious
backs
for
where
would
any
of
it
have
been
without
their
unremitting
unrewarded
labor
in
the
fields
and
so
with
us
not
to
our
generals
and
poets
i
thought
but
to
the
italian
and
hungarian
laborers
in
the
subway
rather
ought
the
monuments
of
gratitude
and
reverence
of
a
city
like
boston
to
be
reared
if
any
of
you
have
been
readers
of
tolstoï
you
will
see
that
i
passed
into
a
vein
of
feeling
similar
to
his
with
its
abhorrence
of
all
that
conventionally
passes
for
distinguished
and
its
exclusive
deification
of
the
bravery
patience
kindliness
and
dumbness
of
the
unconscious
natural
man
where
now
is
tolstoï
i
said
to
bring
the
truth
of
all
this
home
to
our
american
bosoms
fill
us
with
a
better
insight
and
wean
us
away
from
that
spurious
literary
romanticism
on
which
our
wretched
culture
as
it
calls
itself
is
fed
divinity
lies
all
about
us
and
culture
is
too
hidebound
to
even
suspect
the
fact
could
a
howells
or
a
kipling
be
enlisted
in
this
mission
or
are
they
still
too
deep
in
the
ancestral
blindness
and
not
humane
enough
for
the
inner
joy
and
meaning
of
the
laborer
existence
to
be
really
revealed
must
we
wait
for
some
one
born
and
bred
and
living
as
a
laborer
himself
but
who
by
grace
of
heaven
shall
also
find
a
literary
voice
and
there
i
rested
on
that
day
with
a
sense
of
widening
of
vision
and
with
what
it
is
surely
fair
to
call
an
increase
of
religious
insight
into
life
in
god
eyes
the
differences
of
social
position
of
intellect
of
culture
of
cleanliness
of
dress
which
different
men
exhibit
and
all
the
other
rarities
and
exceptions
on
which
they
so
fantastically
pin
their
pride
must
be
so
small
as
practically
quite
to
vanish
and
all
that
should
remain
is
the
common
fact
that
here
we
are
a
countless
multitude
of
vessels
of
life
each
of
us
pent
in
to
peculiar
difficulties
with
which
we
must
severally
struggle
by
using
whatever
of
fortitude
and
goodness
we
can
summon
up
the
exercise
of
the
courage
patience
and
kindness
must
be
the
significant
portion
of
the
whole
business
and
the
distinctions
of
position
can
only
be
a
manner
of
diversifying
the
phenomenal
surface
upon
which
these
underground
virtues
may
manifest
their
effects
at
this
rate
the
deepest
human
life
is
everywhere
is
eternal
and
if
any
human
attributes
exist
only
in
particular
individuals
they
must
belong
to
the
mere
trapping
and
decoration
of
the
thus
are
men
lives
levelled
up
as
well
as
levelled
down
levelled
up
in
their
common
inner
meaning
levelled
down
in
their
outer
gloriousness
and
show
yet
always
we
must
confess
this
levelling
insight
tends
to
be
obscured
again
and
always
the
ancestral
blindness
returns
and
wraps
us
up
so
that
we
end
once
more
by
thinking
that
creation
can
be
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
develop
remarkable
situations
and
conventional
distinctions
and
merits
and
then
always
some
new
leveller
in
the
shape
of
a
religious
prophet
has
to
arise
the
buddha
the
christ
or
some
saint
francis
some
rousseau
or
tolstoï
to
redispel
our
blindness
yet
little
by
little
there
comes
some
stable
gain
for
the
world
does
get
more
humane
and
the
religion
of
democracy
tends
toward
permanent
increase
this
as
i
said
became
for
a
time
my
conviction
and
gave
me
great
content
i
have
put
the
matter
into
the
form
of
a
personal
reminiscence
so
that
i
might
lead
you
into
it
more
directly
and
completely
and
so
save
time
but
now
i
am
going
to
discuss
the
rest
of
it
with
you
in
a
more
impersonal
way
tolstoï
levelling
philosophy
began
long
before
he
had
the
crisis
of
melancholy
commemorated
in
that
wonderful
document
of
his
entitled
confession
which
led
the
way
to
his
more
specifically
religious
works
in
his
masterpiece
and
peace
assuredly
the
greatest
of
human
novels
the
rôle
of
the
spiritual
hero
is
given
to
a
poor
little
soldier
named
karataïeff
so
helpful
so
cheerful
and
so
devout
that
in
spite
of
his
ignorance
and
filthiness
the
sight
of
him
opens
the
heavens
which
have
been
closed
to
the
mind
of
the
principal
character
of
the
book
and
his
example
evidently
is
meant
by
tolstoï
to
let
god
into
the
world
again
for
the
reader
poor
little
karataïeff
is
taken
prisoner
by
the
french
and
when
too
exhausted
by
hardship
and
fever
to
march
is
shot
as
other
prisoners
were
in
the
famous
retreat
from
moscow
the
last
view
one
gets
of
him
is
his
little
figure
leaning
against
a
white
and
uncomplainingly
awaiting
the
end
the
more
writes
tolstoï
in
the
work
confession
the
more
i
examined
the
life
of
these
laboring
folks
the
more
persuaded
i
became
that
they
veritably
have
faith
and
get
from
it
alone
the
sense
and
the
possibility
of
life
contrariwise
to
those
of
our
own
class
who
protest
against
destiny
and
grow
indignant
at
its
rigor
these
people
receive
maladies
and
misfortunes
without
revolt
without
opposition
and
with
a
firm
and
tranquil
confidence
that
all
had
to
be
like
that
could
not
be
otherwise
and
that
it
is
all
right
so
the
more
we
live
by
our
intellect
the
less
we
understand
the
meaning
of
life
we
see
only
a
cruel
jest
in
suffering
and
death
whereas
these
people
live
suffer
and
draw
near
to
death
with
tranquillity
and
oftener
than
not
with
joy
there
are
enormous
multitudes
of
them
happy
with
the
most
perfect
happiness
although
deprived
of
what
for
us
is
the
sole
good
of
life
those
who
understand
life
meaning
and
know
how
to
live
and
die
thus
are
to
be
counted
not
by
twos
threes
tens
but
by
hundreds
thousands
millions
they
labor
quietly
endure
privations
and
pains
live
and
die
and
throughout
everything
see
the
good
without
seeing
the
vanity
i
had
to
love
these
people
the
more
i
entered
into
their
life
the
more
i
loved
them
and
the
more
it
became
possible
for
me
to
live
too
it
came
about
not
only
that
the
life
of
our
society
of
the
learned
and
of
the
rich
disgusted
me
more
than
that
it
lost
all
semblance
of
meaning
in
my
eyes
all
our
actions
our
deliberations
our
sciences
our
arts
all
appeared
to
me
with
a
new
significance
i
understood
that
these
things
might
be
charming
pastimes
but
that
one
need
seek
in
them
no
depth
whereas
the
life
of
the
populace
of
that
multitude
of
human
beings
who
really
contribute
to
existence
appeared
to
me
in
its
true
light
i
understood
that
there
veritably
is
life
that
the
meaning
which
life
there
receives
is
the
truth
and
i
accepted
it
q
q
my
confession
x
condensed
in
a
similar
way
does
stevenson
appeal
to
our
piety
toward
the
elemental
virtue
of
mankind
what
a
wonderful
thing
he
writes
r
is
this
man
how
surprising
are
his
attributes
poor
soul
here
for
so
little
cast
among
so
many
hardships
savagely
surrounded
savagely
descended
irremediably
condemned
to
prey
upon
his
who
should
have
blamed
him
had
he
been
of
a
piece
with
his
destiny
and
a
being
merely
barbarous
yet
it
matters
not
where
we
look
under
what
climate
we
observe
him
in
what
stage
of
society
in
what
depth
of
ignorance
burdened
with
what
erroneous
morality
in
ships
at
sea
a
man
inured
to
hardship
and
vile
pleasures
his
brightest
hope
a
fiddle
in
a
tavern
and
a
bedizened
trull
who
sells
herself
to
rob
him
and
he
for
all
that
simple
innocent
cheerful
kindly
like
a
child
constant
to
toil
brave
to
drown
for
others
in
the
slums
of
cities
moving
among
indifferent
millions
to
mechanical
employments
without
hope
of
change
in
the
future
with
scarce
a
pleasure
in
the
present
and
yet
true
to
his
virtues
honest
up
to
his
lights
kind
to
his
neighbors
tempted
perhaps
in
vain
by
the
bright
often
repaying
the
world
scorn
with
service
often
standing
firm
upon
a
scruple
everywhere
some
virtue
cherished
or
affected
everywhere
some
decency
of
thought
and
courage
everywhere
the
ensign
of
man
ineffectual
goodness
ah
if
i
could
show
you
this
if
i
could
show
you
these
men
and
women
all
the
world
over
in
every
stage
of
history
under
every
abuse
of
error
under
every
circumstance
of
failure
without
hope
without
help
without
thanks
still
obscurely
fighting
the
lost
fight
of
virtue
still
clinging
to
some
rag
of
honor
the
poor
jewel
of
their
souls
r
across
the
plains
pulvis
et
umbra
abridged
all
this
is
as
true
as
it
is
splendid
and
terribly
do
we
need
our
tolstoïs
and
stevensons
to
keep
our
sense
for
it
alive
yet
you
remember
the
irishman
who
when
asked
is
not
one
man
as
good
as
another
replied
yes
and
a
great
deal
better
too
similarly
it
seems
to
me
does
tolstoï
overcorrect
our
social
prejudices
when
he
makes
his
love
of
the
peasant
so
exclusive
and
hardens
his
heart
toward
the
educated
man
as
absolutely
as
he
does
grant
that
at
chautauqua
there
was
little
moral
effort
little
sweat
or
muscular
strain
in
view
still
deep
down
in
the
souls
of
the
participants
we
may
be
sure
that
something
of
the
sort
was
hid
some
inner
stress
some
vital
virtue
not
found
wanting
when
required
and
after
all
the
question
recurs
and
forces
itself
upon
us
is
it
so
certain
that
the
surroundings
and
circumstances
of
the
virtue
do
make
so
little
difference
in
the
importance
of
the
result
is
the
functional
utility
the
worth
to
the
universe
of
a
certain
definite
amount
of
courage
kindliness
and
patience
no
greater
if
the
possessor
of
these
virtues
is
in
an
educated
situation
working
out
tasks
than
if
he
be
an
illiterate
nobody
hewing
wood
and
drawing
water
just
to
keep
himself
alive
tolstoï
philosophy
deeply
enlightening
though
it
certainly
is
remains
a
false
abstraction
it
savors
too
much
of
that
oriental
pessimism
and
nihilism
of
his
which
declares
the
whole
phenomenal
world
and
its
facts
and
their
distinctions
to
be
a
cunning
fraud
a
mere
bare
fraud
is
just
what
our
western
common
sense
will
never
believe
the
phenomenal
world
to
be
it
admits
fully
that
the
inner
joys
and
virtues
are
the
part
of
life
business
but
it
is
sure
that
positive
part
is
also
played
by
the
adjuncts
of
the
show
if
it
is
idiotic
in
romanticism
to
recognize
the
heroic
only
when
it
sees
it
labelled
and
in
books
it
is
really
just
as
idiotic
to
see
it
only
in
the
dirty
boots
and
sweaty
shirt
of
some
one
in
the
fields
it
is
with
us
really
under
every
disguise
at
chautauqua
here
in
your
college
in
the
and
on
the
and
in
the
czar
of
russia
court
but
instinctively
we
make
a
combination
of
two
things
in
judging
the
total
significance
of
a
human
being
we
feel
it
to
be
some
sort
of
a
product
if
such
a
product
only
could
be
calculated
of
his
inner
virtue
his
outer
place
neither
singly
taken
but
both
conjoined
if
the
outer
differences
had
no
meaning
for
life
why
indeed
should
all
this
immense
variety
of
them
exist
they
be
significant
elements
of
the
world
as
well
just
test
tolstoï
deification
of
the
mere
manual
laborer
by
the
facts
this
is
what
walter
wyckoff
after
working
as
an
unskilled
laborer
in
the
demolition
of
some
buildings
at
west
point
writes
of
the
spiritual
condition
of
the
class
of
men
to
which
he
temporarily
chose
to
belong
the
salient
features
of
our
condition
are
plain
enough
we
are
grown
men
and
are
without
a
trade
in
the
we
stand
ready
to
sell
to
the
highest
bidder
our
mere
muscular
strength
for
so
many
hours
each
day
we
are
thus
in
the
lowest
grade
of
labor
and
selling
our
muscular
strength
in
the
open
market
for
what
it
will
bring
we
sell
it
under
peculiar
conditions
it
is
all
the
capital
that
we
have
we
have
no
reserve
means
of
subsistence
and
can
not
therefore
stand
off
for
a
price
we
sell
under
the
necessity
of
satisfying
imminent
hunger
broadly
speaking
we
must
sell
our
labor
or
starve
and
as
hunger
is
a
matter
of
a
few
hours
and
we
have
no
other
way
of
meeting
this
need
we
must
sell
at
once
for
what
the
market
offers
for
our
labor
our
employer
is
buying
labor
in
a
dear
market
and
he
will
certainly
get
from
us
as
much
work
as
he
can
at
the
price
the
is
secured
for
this
purpose
and
thoroughly
does
he
know
his
business
he
has
sole
command
of
us
he
never
saw
us
before
and
he
will
discharge
us
all
when
the
débris
is
cleared
away
in
the
mean
time
he
must
get
from
us
if
he
can
the
utmost
of
physical
labor
which
we
individually
and
collectively
are
capable
of
if
he
should
drive
some
of
us
to
exhaustion
and
we
should
not
be
able
to
continue
at
work
he
would
not
be
the
loser
for
the
market
would
soon
supply
him
with
others
to
take
our
places
we
are
ignorant
men
but
so
much
we
clearly
see
that
we
have
sold
our
labor
where
we
could
sell
it
dearest
and
our
employer
has
bought
it
where
he
could
buy
it
cheapest
he
has
paid
high
and
he
must
get
all
the
labor
that
he
can
and
by
a
strong
instinct
which
possesses
us
we
shall
part
with
as
little
as
we
can
from
work
like
ours
there
seems
to
us
to
have
been
eliminated
every
element
which
constitutes
the
nobility
of
labor
we
feel
no
personal
pride
in
its
progress
and
no
community
of
interest
with
our
employer
there
is
none
of
the
joy
of
responsibility
none
of
the
sense
of
achievement
only
the
dull
monotony
of
grinding
toil
with
the
longing
for
the
signal
to
quit
work
and
for
our
wages
at
the
end
and
being
what
we
are
the
dregs
of
the
and
having
no
certainty
of
permanent
employment
and
no
organization
among
ourselves
we
must
expect
to
work
under
the
watchful
eye
of
a
and
be
driven
like
the
that
we
are
through
our
tasks
all
this
is
to
tell
us
in
effect
that
our
lives
are
hard
barren
hopeless
lives
and
such
hard
barren
hopeless
lives
surely
are
not
lives
in
which
one
ought
to
be
willing
permanently
to
remain
and
why
is
this
so
is
it
because
they
are
so
dirty
well
nansen
grew
a
great
deal
dirtier
on
his
polar
expedition
and
we
think
none
the
worse
of
his
life
for
that
is
it
the
insensibility
our
soldiers
have
to
grow
vastly
more
insensible
and
we
extol
them
to
the
skies
is
it
the
poverty
poverty
has
been
reckoned
the
crowning
beauty
of
many
a
heroic
career
is
it
the
slavery
to
a
task
the
loss
of
finer
pleasures
such
slavery
and
loss
are
of
the
very
essence
of
the
higher
fortitude
and
are
always
counted
to
its
credit
read
the
records
of
missionary
devotion
all
over
the
world
it
is
not
any
one
of
these
things
then
taken
by
itself
no
nor
all
of
them
together
that
make
such
a
life
undesirable
a
man
might
in
truth
live
like
an
unskilled
laborer
and
do
the
work
of
one
and
yet
count
as
one
of
the
noblest
of
god
creatures
quite
possibly
there
were
some
such
persons
in
the
gang
that
our
author
describes
but
the
current
of
their
souls
ran
underground
and
he
was
too
steeped
in
the
ancestral
blindness
to
discern
it
if
there
any
such
morally
exceptional
individuals
however
what
made
them
different
from
the
rest
it
can
only
have
been
this
that
their
souls
worked
and
endured
in
obedience
to
some
inner
while
their
comrades
were
not
actuated
by
anything
worthy
of
that
name
these
ideals
of
other
lives
are
among
those
secrets
that
we
can
almost
never
penetrate
although
something
about
the
man
may
often
tell
us
when
they
are
there
in
wyckoff
own
case
we
know
exactly
what
the
ideal
was
partly
he
had
stumped
himself
as
the
boys
say
to
carry
through
a
strenuous
achievement
but
mainly
he
wished
to
enlarge
his
sympathetic
insight
into
for
this
his
sweat
and
toil
acquire
a
certain
heroic
significance
and
make
us
accord
to
him
exceptional
esteem
but
it
is
easy
to
imagine
his
fellows
with
various
other
ideals
to
say
nothing
of
wives
and
babies
one
may
have
been
a
convert
of
the
salvation
army
and
had
a
nightingale
singing
of
expiation
and
forgiveness
in
his
heart
all
the
while
he
labored
or
there
might
have
been
an
apostle
like
tolstoï
himself
or
his
compatriot
bondareff
in
the
gang
voluntarily
embracing
labor
as
their
religious
mission
was
undoubtedly
an
ideal
with
many
and
who
knows
how
much
of
that
higher
manliness
of
poverty
of
which
phillips
brooks
has
spoken
so
penetratingly
was
or
was
not
present
in
that
gang
a
rugged
barren
land
says
phillips
brooks
is
poverty
to
live
in
a
land
where
i
am
thankful
very
often
if
i
can
get
a
berry
or
a
root
to
eat
but
living
in
it
really
letting
it
bear
witness
to
me
of
itself
not
dishonoring
it
all
the
time
by
judging
it
after
the
standard
of
the
other
lands
gradually
there
come
out
its
qualities
behold
no
land
like
this
barren
and
naked
land
of
poverty
could
show
the
moral
geology
of
the
world
see
how
the
hard
ribs
stand
out
strong
and
solid
no
life
like
poverty
could
so
get
one
to
the
heart
of
things
and
make
men
know
their
meaning
could
so
let
us
feel
life
and
the
world
with
all
the
soft
cushions
stripped
off
and
thrown
away
poverty
makes
men
come
very
near
each
other
and
recognize
each
other
human
hearts
and
poverty
highest
and
best
of
all
demands
and
cries
out
for
faith
in
god
i
know
how
superficial
and
unfeeling
how
like
mere
mockery
words
in
praise
of
poverty
may
seem
but
i
am
sure
that
the
poor
man
dignity
and
freedom
his
and
energy
depend
upon
his
cordial
knowledge
that
his
poverty
is
a
true
region
and
kind
of
life
with
its
own
chances
of
character
its
own
springs
of
happiness
and
revelations
of
god
let
him
resist
the
characterlessness
which
often
goes
with
being
poor
let
him
insist
on
respecting
the
condition
where
he
lives
let
him
learn
to
love
it
so
that
by
and
by
if
he
grows
rich
he
shall
go
out
of
the
low
door
of
the
old
familiar
poverty
with
a
true
pang
of
regret
and
with
a
true
honor
for
the
narrow
home
in
which
he
has
lived
so
long
s
s
sermons

pp
the
barrenness
and
ignobleness
of
the
more
usual
laborer
life
consist
in
the
fact
that
it
is
moved
by
no
such
ideal
inner
springs
the
backache
the
long
hours
the
danger
are
patiently
endured
for
what
to
gain
a
quid
of
tobacco
a
glass
of
beer
a
cup
of
coffee
a
meal
and
a
bed
and
to
begin
again
the
next
day
and
shirk
as
much
as
one
can
this
really
is
why
we
raise
no
monument
to
the
laborers
in
the
subway
even
though
they
be
our
conscripts
and
even
though
after
a
fashion
our
city
is
indeed
based
upon
their
patient
hearts
and
enduring
backs
and
shoulders
and
this
is
why
we
do
raise
monuments
to
our
soldiers
whose
outward
conditions
were
even
brutaller
still
the
soldiers
are
supposed
to
have
followed
an
ideal
and
the
laborers
are
supposed
to
have
followed
none
you
see
my
friends
how
the
plot
now
thickens
and
how
strangely
the
complexities
of
this
wonderful
human
nature
of
ours
begin
to
develop
under
our
hands
we
have
seen
the
blindness
and
deadness
to
each
other
which
are
our
natural
inheritance
and
in
spite
of
them
we
have
been
led
to
acknowledge
an
inner
meaning
which
passeth
show
and
which
may
be
present
in
the
lives
of
others
where
we
least
descry
it
and
now
we
are
led
to
say
that
such
inner
meaning
can
be
and
for
us
only
when
the
inner
joy
courage
and
endurance
are
joined
with
an
ideal
but
what
exactly
do
we
mean
by
an
ideal
can
we
give
no
definite
account
of
such
a
word
to
a
certain
extent
we
can
an
ideal
for
instance
must
be
something
intellectually
conceived
something
of
which
we
are
not
unconscious
if
we
have
it
and
it
must
carry
with
it
that
sort
of
outlook
uplift
and
brightness
that
go
with
all
intellectual
facts
secondly
there
must
be
in
an
ideal
novelty
at
least
for
him
whom
the
ideal

sodden
routine
is
incompatible
with
ideality
although
what
is
sodden
routine
for
one
person
may
be
ideal
novelty
for
another
this
shows
that
there
is
nothing
absolutely
ideal
ideals
are
relative
to
the
lives
that
entertain
them
to
keep
out
of
the
gutter
is
for
us
here
no
part
of
consciousness
at
all
yet
for
many
of
our
brethren
it
is
the
most
legitimately
engrossing
of
ideals
now
taken
nakedly
abstractly
and
immediately
you
see
that
mere
ideals
are
the
cheapest
things
in
life
everybody
has
them
in
some
shape
or
other
personal
or
general
sound
or
mistaken
low
or
high
and
the
most
worthless
sentimentalists
and
dreamers
drunkards
shirks
and
who
never
show
a
grain
of
effort
courage
or
endurance
possibly
have
them
on
the
most
copious
scale
education
enlarging
as
it
does
our
horizon
and
perspective
is
a
means
of
multiplying
our
ideals
of
bringing
new
ones
into
view
and
your
college
professor
with
a
starched
shirt
and
spectacles
would
if
a
stock
of
ideals
were
all
alone
by
itself
enough
to
render
a
life
significant
be
the
most
absolutely
and
deeply
significant
of
men
tolstoï
would
be
completely
blind
in
despising
him
for
a
prig
a
pedant
and
a
parody
and
all
our
new
insight
into
the
divinity
of
muscular
labor
would
be
altogether
off
the
track
of
truth
but
such
consequences
as
this
you
instinctively
feel
are
erroneous
the
more
ideals
a
man
has
the
more
contemptible
on
the
whole
do
you
continue
to
deem
him
if
the
matter
ends
there
for
him
and
if
none
of
the
laboring
man
virtues
are
called
into
action
on
his
part
no
courage
shown
no
privations
undergone
no
dirt
or
scars
contracted
in
the
attempt
to
get
them
realized
it
is
quite
obvious
that
something
more
than
the
mere
possession
of
ideals
is
required
to
make
a
life
significant
in
any
sense
that
claims
the
spectator
admiration
inner
joy
to
be
sure
it
may
with
its
ideals
but
that
is
its
own
private
sentimental
matter
to
extort
from
us
outsiders
as
we
are
with
our
own
ideals
to
look
after
the
tribute
of
our
grudging
recognition
it
must
back
its
ideal
visions
with
what
the
laborers
have
the
sterner
stuff
of
manly
virtue
it
must
multiply
their
sentimental
surface
by
the
dimension
of
the
active
will
if
we
are
to
have
if
we
are
to
have
anything
cubical
and
solid
in
the
way
of
character
the
significance
of
a
human
life
for
communicable
and
publicly
recognizable
purposes
is
thus
the
offspring
of
a
marriage
of
two
different
parents
either
of
whom
alone
is
barren
the
ideals
taken
by
themselves
give
no
reality
the
virtues
by
themselves
no
novelty
and
let
the
orientalists
and
pessimists
say
what
they
will
the
thing
of
deepest
or
at
any
rate
of
comparatively
deepest
significance
in
life
does
seem
to
be
its
character
of
or
that
strange
union
of
reality
with
ideal
novelty
which
it
continues
from
one
moment
to
another
to
present
to
recognize
ideal
novelty
is
the
task
of
what
we
call
intelligence
not
every
one
intelligence
can
tell
which
novelties
are
ideal
for
many
the
ideal
thing
will
always
seem
to
cling
still
to
the
older
more
familiar
good
in
this
case
character
though
not
significant
totally
may
be
still
significant
pathetically
so
if
we
are
to
choose
which
is
the
more
essential
factor
of
human
character
the
fighting
virtue
or
the
intellectual
breadth
we
must
side
with
tolstoï
and
choose
that
simple
faithfulness
to
his
light
or
darkness
which
any
common
unintellectual
man
can
show
but
with
all
this
beating
and
tacking
on
my
part
i
fear
you
take
me
to
be
reaching
a
confused
result
i
seem
to
be
just
taking
things
up
and
dropping
them
again
first
i
took
up
chautauqua
and
dropped
that
then
tolstoï
and
the
heroism
of
common
toil
and
dropped
them
finally
i
took
up
ideals
and
seem
now
almost
dropping
those
but
please
observe
in
what
sense
it
is
that
i
drop
them
it
is
when
they
pretend
to
redeem
life
from
insignificance
culture
and
refinement
all
alone
are
not
enough
to
do
so
ideal
aspirations
are
not
enough
when
uncombined
with
pluck
and
will
but
neither
are
pluck
and
will
dogged
endurance
and
insensibility
to
danger
enough
when
taken
all
alone
there
must
be
some
sort
of
fusion
some
chemical
combination
among
these
principles
for
a
life
objectively
and
thoroughly
significant
to
result
of
course
this
is
a
somewhat
vague
conclusion
but
in
a
question
of
significance
of
worth
like
this
conclusions
can
never
be
precise
the
answer
of
appreciation
of
sentiment
is
always
a
more
or
a
less
a
balance
struck
by
sympathy
insight
and
good
will
but
it
is
an
answer
all
the
same
a
real
conclusion
and
in
the
course
of
getting
it
it
seems
to
me
that
our
eyes
have
been
opened
to
many
important
things
some
of
you
are
perhaps
more
livingly
aware
than
you
were
an
hour
ago
of
the
depths
of
worth
that
lie
around
you
hid
in
alien
lives
and
when
you
ask
how
much
sympathy
you
ought
to
bestow
although
the
amount
is
truly
enough
a
matter
of
ideal
on
your
own
part
yet
in
this
notion
of
the
combination
of
ideals
with
active
virtues
you
have
a
rough
standard
for
shaping
your
decision
in
any
case
your
imagination
is
extended
you
divine
in
the
world
about
you
matter
for
a
little
more
humility
on
your
own
part
and
tolerance
reverence
and
love
for
others
and
you
gain
a
certain
inner
joyfulness
at
the
increased
importance
of
our
common
life
such
joyfulness
is
a
religious
inspiration
and
an
element
of
spiritual
health
and
worth
more
than
large
amounts
of
that
sort
of
technical
and
accurate
information
which
we
professors
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
impart
to
show
the
sort
of
thing
i
mean
by
these
words
i
will
just
make
one
brief
practical
illustration
and
then
close
we
are
suffering
in
america
from
what
is
called
the
and
when
you
go
out
into
the
world
you
will
each
and
all
of
you
be
caught
up
in
its
perplexities
i
use
the
brief
term
to
cover
all
sorts
of
anarchistic
discontents
and
socialistic
projects
and
the
conservative
resistances
which
they
provoke
so
far
as
this
conflict
is
unhealthy
and
regrettable
and
i
think
it
is
so
only
to
a
limited
extent
the
unhealthiness
consists
solely
in
the
fact
that
of
our
remain
entirely
blind
to
the
internal
significance
of
the
lives
of
the
other
half
they
miss
the
joys
and
sorrows
they
fail
to
feel
the
moral
virtue
and
they
do
not
guess
the
presence
of
the
intellectual
ideals
they
are
at
all
along
the
line
regarding
each
other
as
they
might
regard
a
set
of
dangerously
gesticulating
automata
or
if
they
seek
to
get
at
the
inner
motivation
making
the
most
horrible
mistakes
often
all
that
the
poor
man
can
think
of
in
the
rich
man
is
a
cowardly
greediness
for
safety
luxury
and
effeminacy
and
a
boundless
affectation
what
he
is
is
not
a
human
being
but
a
a
and
a
similar
greediness
turned
by
disappointment
into
envy
is
all
that
many
rich
men
can
see
in
the
state
of
mind
of
the
dissatisfied
poor
and
if
the
rich
man
begins
to
do
the
sentimental
act
over
the
poor
man
what
senseless
blunders
does
he
make
pitying
him
for
just
those
very
duties
and
those
very
immunities
which
rightly
taken
are
the
condition
of
his
most
abiding
and
characteristic
joys
each
in
short
ignores
the
fact
that
happiness
and
unhappiness
and
significance
are
a
vital
mystery
each
pins
them
absolutely
on
some
ridiculous
feature
of
the
external
situation
and
everybody
remains
outside
of
everybody
else
sight
society
has
with
all
this
undoubtedly
got
to
pass
toward
some
newer
and
better
equilibrium
and
the
distribution
of
wealth
has
doubtless
slowly
got
to
change
such
changes
have
always
happened
and
will
happen
to
the
end
of
time
but
if
after
all
that
i
have
said
any
of
you
expect
that
they
will
make
any
vital
on
a
large
scale
to
the
lives
of
our
descendants
you
will
have
missed
the
significance
of
my
entire
lecture
the
solid
meaning
of
life
is
always
the
same
eternal
thing
the
marriage
namely
of
some
unhabitual
ideal
however
special
with
some
fidelity
courage
and
endurance
with
some
man
or
woman
and
whatever
or
wherever
life
may
be
there
will
always
be
the
chance
for
that
marriage
to
take
place
stephen
wrote
many
years
ago
words
to
this
effect
more
eloquent
than
any
i
can
speak
the
eastern
or
some
of
her
successors
he
said
will
perhaps
defy
the
roll
of
the
atlantic
and
cross
the
seas
without
allowing
their
passengers
to
feel
that
they
have
left
the
firm
land
the
voyage
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
may
come
to
be
performed
with
similar
facility
progress
and
science
may
perhaps
enable
untold
millions
to
live
and
die
without
a
care
without
a
pang
without
an
anxiety
they
will
have
a
pleasant
passage
and
plenty
of
brilliant
conversation
they
will
wonder
that
men
ever
believed
at
all
in
clanging
fights
and
blazing
towns
and
sinking
ships
and
praying
hands
and
when
they
come
to
the
end
of
their
course
they
will
go
their
way
and
the
place
thereof
will
know
them
no
more
but
it
seems
unlikely
that
they
will
have
such
a
knowledge
of
the
great
ocean
on
which
they
sail
with
its
storms
and
wrecks
its
currents
and
icebergs
its
huge
waves
and
mighty
winds
as
those
who
battled
with
it
for
years
together
in
the
little
craft
which
if
they
had
few
other
merits
brought
those
who
navigated
them
full
into
the
presence
of
time
and
eternity
their
maker
and
themselves
and
forced
them
to
have
some
definite
view
of
their
relations
to
them
and
to
each
other
t
t
essays
by
a
barrister
london
in
this
solid
and
tridimensional
sense
so
to
call
it
those
philosophers
are
right
who
contend
that
the
world
is
a
standing
thing
with
no
progress
no
real
history
the
changing
conditions
of
history
touch
only
the
surface
of
the
show
the
altered
equilibriums
and
redistributions
only
diversify
our
opportunities
and
open
chances
to
us
for
new
ideals
but
with
each
new
ideal
that
comes
into
life
the
chance
for
a
life
based
on
some
old
ideal
will
vanish
and
he
would
needs
be
a
presumptuous
calculator
who
should
with
confidence
say
that
the
total
sum
of
significances
is
positively
and
absolutely
greater
at
any
one
epoch
than
at
any
other
of
the
world
i
am
speaking
broadly
i
know
and
omitting
to
consider
certain
qualifications
in
which
i
myself
believe
but
one
can
only
make
one
point
in
one
lecture
and
i
shall
be
well
content
if
i
have
brought
my
point
home
to
you
this
evening
in
even
a
slight
degree
are
and
no
outward
changes
of
condition
in
life
can
keep
the
nightingale
of
its
eternal
meaning
from
singing
in
all
sorts
of
different
men
hearts
that
is
the
main
fact
to
remember
if
we
could
not
only
admit
it
with
our
lips
but
really
and
truly
believe
it
how
our
convulsive
insistencies
how
our
antipathies
and
dreads
of
each
other
would
soften
down
if
the
poor
and
the
rich
could
look
at
each
other
in
this
way
specie
how
gentle
would
grow
their
disputes
what
tolerance
and
good
humor
what
willingness
to
live
and
let
live
would
come
into
the
world
the
end
