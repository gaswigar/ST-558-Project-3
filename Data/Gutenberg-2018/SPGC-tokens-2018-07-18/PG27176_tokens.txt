more
beasts
for
worse
children
introduction
the
parents
of
the
learned
child
his
father
and
his
mother
were
utterly
aghast
to
note
the
facts
he
would
at
random
quote
on
creatures
curious
rare
and
wild
and
wondering
asked
each
other
illustration
an
idle
little
child
like
this
how
is
it
that
he
knows
what
years
of
close
analysis
are
powerless
to
disclose
our
brains
are
trained
our
books
are
big
and
yet
we
always
fail
to
answer
why
the
is
born
without
a
tail
illustration
or
why
the
wanderoo
a
should
rant
in
wild
unmeaning
rhymes
whereas
the
indian
elephant
will
only
read
illustration
illustration
perhaps
he
found
a
way
to
slip
unnoticed
to
the
zoo
and
gave
the
pachyderm
a
tip
or
pumped
the
wanderoo
or
even
by
an
artful
plan
deceived
our
watchful
eyes
and
interviewed
the
pelican
who
is
extremely
wise
illustration
oh
no
said
he
in
humble
tone
with
shy
but
conscious
look
such
facts
i
never
could
have
known
but
for
this
little
book
the
python
illustration
a
python
i
should
not
advise
it
needs
a
doctor
for
its
eyes
and
has
the
measles
yearly
illustration
however
if
you
feel
inclined
to
get
one
to
improve
your
mind
and
not
from
fashion
merely
allow
no
music
near
its
cage
and
when
it
flies
into
a
rage
chastise
it
most
severely
illustration
illustration
i
had
an
aunt
in
yucatan
who
bought
a
python
from
a
man
and
kept
it
for
a
pet
she
died
because
she
never
knew
these
simple
little
rules
and
few

the
snake
is
living
yet
the
welsh
mutton
illustration
the
cambrian
welsh
or
mountain
sheep
is
of
the
ovine
race
his
conversation
is
not
deep
but
then
observe
his
face
the
porcupine
illustration
what
would
you
slap
the
porcupine
unhappy
child
desist
alas
that
any
friend
of
mine
should
turn
b
illustration
to
strike
the
meanest
and
the
least
of
creatures
is
a
sin
how
much
more
bad
to
beat
a
beast
with
prickles
on
its
skin

the
scorpion
illustration
the
scorpion
is
as
black
as
soot
he
dearly
loves
to
bite
he
is
a
most
unpleasant
brute
to
find
in
bed
at
night
the
crocodile
illustration
whatever
our
faults
we
can
always
engage
that
no
fancy
or
fable
shall
sully
our
page
so
take
note
of
what
follows
i
beg
this
creature
so
grand
and
august
in
its
age
in
its
youth
is
hatched
out
of
an
egg
illustration
and
oft
in
some
far
coptic
town
the
missionary
sits
him
down
to
breakfast
by
the
nile
the
heart
beneath
his
priestly
gown
is
innocent
of
guile
illustration
when
suddenly
the
rigid
frown
of
panic
is
observed
to
drown
his
customary
smile
illustration
why
does
he
start
and
leap
amain
illustration
and
scour
the
sandy
libyan
plain
illustration
like
one
that
wants
to
catch
a
train
illustration
or
wrestles
with
internal
pain
illustration
because
he
finds
his
egg
contain
green
hungry
horrible
and
plain
an
infant
crocodile
the
vulture
illustration
the
vulture
eats
between
his
meals
and
that
the
reason
why
he
very
very
rarely
feels
as
well
as
you
and
i
illustration
his
eye
is
dull
his
head
is
bald
his
neck
is
growing
thinner
oh
what
a
lesson
for
us
all
to
only
eat
at
dinner
the
bison
illustration
the
bison
is
vain
and
i
write
it
with
pain
the
you
see
on
his
head
illustration
is
not
as
some
learned
professors
maintain
the
opulent
growth
of
a
genius
brain
illustration
but
is
sewn
on
with
needle
and
thread
the
viper
illustration
yet
another
great
truth
i
record
in
my
verse
that
some
vipers
are
venomous
some
the
reverse
a
fact
you
may
prove
if
you
try
illustration
by
procuring
two
vipers
and
letting
them
bite
illustration
with
the
you
are
only
the
worse
for
a
fright
illustration
but
after
the
you
die
the
llama
illustration
the
llama
is
a
woolly
sort
of
fleecy
hairy
goat
with
an
indolent
expression
and
an
undulating
throat
like
an
unsuccessful
literary
man
illustration
and
i
know
the
place
he
lives
in
or
at
least
i
think
i
do
it
is
ecuador
brazil
or
chili
possibly
peru
you
must
find
it
in
the
atlas
if
you
can
illustration
the
llama
of
the
pampasses
you
never
should
confound
in
spite
of
a
deceptive
similarity
of
sound
with
the
lhama
who
is
lord
of
turkestan
illustration
for
the
former
is
a
beautiful
and
valuable
beast
but
the
latter
is
not
lovable
nor
useful
in
the
least
and
the
ruminant
is
preferable
surely
to
the
priest
who
battens
on
the
woful
superstitions
of
the
east
the
mongol
of
the
monastery
of
shan
the
chamois
illustration
the
chamois
inhabits
lucerne
where
his
habits
though
why
i
have
not
an
give
him
sudden
short
spasms
on
the
brink
of
deep
chasms
and
he
lives
in
perpetual
fear
the
frozen
mammoth
illustration
this
creature
though
rare
is
still
found
to
the
east
of
the
northern
siberian
zone
illustration
it
is
known
to
the
whole
of
that
primitive
group
that
the
carcass
will
furnish
an
excellent
soup
though
the
cooking
it
offers
one
drawback
at
least
of
a
serious
nature
i
own
illustration
if
the
skin
be
before
it
is
boiled
your
confection
is
wholly
and
utterly
spoiled
illustration
and
hence
on
account
of
the
size
of
the
beast
the
dainty
is
nearly
unknown
the
microbe
illustration
the
microbe
is
so
very
small
you
can
not
make
him
out
at
all
but
many
sanguine
people
hope
to
see
him
through
a
microscope
his
jointed
tongue
that
lies
beneath
a
hundred
curious
rows
of
teeth
his
seven
tufted
tails
with
lots
of
lovely
pink
and
purple
spots
illustration
on
each
of
which
a
pattern
stands
composed
of
forty
separate
bands
his
eyebrows
of
a
tender
green
all
these
have
never
yet
been
seen
but
scientists
who
ought
to
know
assure
us
that
they
must
be
so
oh
let
us
never
never
doubt
what
nobody
is
sure
about
