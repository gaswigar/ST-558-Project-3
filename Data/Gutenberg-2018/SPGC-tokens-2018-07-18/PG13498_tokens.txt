a

he
did
want
to
go
he
loathed
the
very
thought
of
it
every
flinching
nerve
in
him
protested
a
masked
ball
a
masked
ball
at
a
cairo
hotel
grimacing
through
advances
flirtations
ending
in
giggles
tourists
as
nuns
tourists
as
turks
tourists
as
all
preening
and
peacocking
unhappily
he
gazed
upon
the
girl
who
was
proposing
this
horror
as
a
bright
delight
she
was
a
very
engaging
girl
that
was
the
mischief
of
it
she
stood
smiling
there
in
the
bright
egyptian
sunshine
gay
confidence
in
her
gray
eyes
he
hated
to
shatter
that
confidence
and
he
had
done
little
enough
for
her
during
her
stay
in
cairo
one
tea
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
one
trip
to
the
sultan
al
hassan
mosque
one
excursion
through
the
bazaars
not
exactly
an
orgy
of
entertainment
for
a
girl
from
home
he
had
evaded
climbing
the
pyramids
and
fled
from
the
ostrich
farm
he
had
withheld
from
inviting
her
to
the
camp
on
the
edge
of
the
libyan
desert
where
he
was
excavating
although
her
party
had
shown
unmistakable
signs
of
a
willingness
to
be
diverted
from
the
beaten
path
of
its
travel
and
he
was
not
calling
on
her
now
he
had
come
to
cairo
for
supplies
and
she
had
encountered
him
by
chance
upon
a
corner
of
the
crowded
mograby
and
there
promptly
she
had
invited
him
to
ball
but
it
not
my
line
you
know
jinny
he
was
protesting
i
so
fearfully
out
of
dancing
more
reason
to
come
jack
you
need
a
change
from
digging
up
ruins
all
the
time
it
must
be
frightfully
lonely
out
there
on
the
desert
i
ca
think
how
you
stand
it
jack
ryder
smiled
there
was
no
mortal
use
in
explaining
to
jinny
jeffries
that
his
life
on
the
desert
was
the
only
life
in
the
world
that
his
ruins
held
more
thrills
than
all
the
fevers
of
her
tourist
crowds
and
that
he
would
rather
gaze
upon
the
mummied
effigy
of
any
lady
of
the
dynasty
of
amenhotep
than
upon
the
freshest
and
fairest
of
the
damsels
of
the
present
day
it
would
only
tax
jinny
credulity
and
hurt
her
feelings
and
he
liked
jinny
though
not
as
he
liked
queen
hatasu
or
the
little
nameless
creature
he
had
dug
out
of
a
king
jinny
was
an
interfering
modern
she
was
the
incarnation
of
impossible
demands
but
of
course
there
was
no
real
reason
why
he
should
not
stop
over
and
go
to
the
dance
ten
minutes
later
when
she
had
extracted
his
promise
and
abandoned
him
to
the
costumers
he
was
scourging
his
weakness
he
had
known
better
very
well
then
let
him
take
his
medicine
let
him
go
as
here
he
disgustedly
eyed
the
garment
that
the
greek
was
presenting
as
little
lord
fauntleroy
he
deserved
it
shudderingly
he
looked
away
from
the
pretty
velvet
suit
he
scorned
the
monk
robes
that
were
too
redolent
of
former
wearers
he
rejected
the
hot
livery
of
a
russian
mujik
he
flouted
the
banality
of
the
pierrot
pantaloons
thankfully
he
remembered
mclean
kilts
that
was
the
thing
tartans
the
real
scotch
plaids
some
use
now
mclean
precious
sporrans
he
look
him
up
at
once
out
of
the
crowded
mograby
he
made
his
way
on
foot
to
the
esbekeyih
quarters
where
the
streets
were
wider
and
emptier
of
cairene
traffickers
and
shrill
itinerates
and
laden
camels
and
jostling
donkeys
it
was
a
glorious
day
a
day
of
egypt
blue
and
gold
the
sky
was
a
wash
of
water
color
the
streets
a
flood
of
molten
amber
a
little
wind
from
the
north
rustled
the
acacias
and
blew
in
his
bronzed
face
cool
reminders
of
the
widening
nile
and
dancing
waves
he
remembered
a
chap
he
knew
who
had
a
sailing
canoe
but
no
he
was
going
to
get
a
costume
for
a
fool
ball
disgustedly
he
turned
into
the
very
modern
and
residence
that
was
the
home
of
his
friend
andrew
mclean
and
the
offices
of
that
institution
the
agricultural
bank
a
and
houseboy
led
him
across
the
tiled
entrance
into
the
long
room
where
mclean
was
concluding
a
conference
with
two
men
not
the
least
trace
mclean
was
saying
we
questioned
all
our
native
agents
afterwards
ryder
remembered
that
indefinite
little
pause
if
the
two
men
had
not
lingered
if
mclean
had
not
remembered
that
he
was
an
excavator
if
chance
had
not
brushed
the
scales
with
lightning
wings
ever
hear
of
a
chap
called
delcassé
paul
delcassé
a
french
excavator
mclean
suddenly
asked
of
him
disappeared
in
the
desert
about
fifteen
years
ago
he
was
reported
monsieur
to
have
died
of
the
fever
one
of
the
men
explained
mclean
introduced
him
as
a
special
agent
from
france
his
companion
was
one
of
the
secretaries
of
the
french
legation
they
were
trying
every
quarter
for
traces
of
this
delcassé
ryder
memory
darted
back
to
old
library
shelves
he
saw
a
thin
brown
volume
almost
uncut
he
wrote
a
book
on
the
tomb
of
thi
he
said
suddenly
paul
delcassé
i
remember
it
very
well
now
that
he
thought
of
it
the
memory
was
clear
it
was
one
of
those
books
that
had
whetted
his
passion
for
the
past
when
his
student
mind
was
first
kindling
to
buried
cities
and
forgotten
tombs
and
all
the
strange
store
and
loot
of
time
paul
delcassé
he
did
remember
a
word
of
the
book
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
read
it
with
absorption
and
now
the
special
agent
delighted
at
the
recognition
was
talking
eagerly
of
the
writer
he
was
a
brilliant
young
man
monsieur
but
he
was
of
no
importance
to
his
generation
and
he
becomes
so
now
through
the
whim
of
a
capricious
woman
to
disinherit
her
other
heirs
after
all
this
time
she
has
decided
to
make
active
inquiries
but
you
said
that
delcassé
had
died
he
left
a
wife
and
child
her
letters
of
her
husband
death
reached
his
relatives
in
france
then
nothing
more
they
feared
that
the
same
fever
but
nothing
positively
was
known
a
sad
story
monsieur
this
delcassé
was
young
and
adventurous
and
an
ardent
explorer
an
ardent
lover
too
for
he
brought
a
beautiful
french
wife
to
share
the
hazards
of
his
expedition
an
ardent
idiot
thrust
in
mclean
unfeelingly
knocking
a
woman
about
the
desert
not
much
chance
of
a
clue
after
all
these
years
he
concluded
with
a
very
british
air
of
dismissal
but
the
french
agent
was
not
to
be
sundered
from
the
american
who
remembered
the
book
of
delcassé
from
his
pocket
he
brought
a
leather
case
and
from
the
case
a
large
and
ornate
gold
locket
his
picture
monsieur
he
pressed
the
spring
and
offered
ryder
the
miniature
it
was
done
in
france
before
he
returned
on
that
last
trip
and
was
left
with
the
aunt
it
is
said
to
be
a
good
likeness
ryder
looked
down
upon
the
young
face
presented
to
his
gaze
with
a
feeling
of
sympathy
for
this
unlucky
searcher
of
the
past
who
had
left
his
own
secret
in
the
sands
he
had
come
to
conquer
sympathy
mingled
with
blank
wonder
at
the
insanity
which
had
brought
a
woman
with
it
mclean
could
understand
a
man
doing
it
jack
ryder
could
understand
a
man
to
do
it
love
to
ryder
was
incomprehensible
idiocy
woman
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
had
never
been
created
she
was
still
a
spectacle
an
historical
record
an
uncomprehended
motive
nice
looking
chap
he
commented
briefly
fingering
the
curious
old
case
as
he
handed
it
back
i
keep
up
the
inquiries
mclean
assured
them
but
as
i
said
nothing
will
come
of
it
it
been
fifteen
years
one
more
grain
lost
in
the
desert
of
sand
by
luck
you
know
you
might
just
stumble
on
something
some
native
who
knew
the
story
but
if
fever
carried
them
off
and
the
arabs
rifled
their
camp
as
i
fancy
they
jolly
well
keep
their
mouths
shut
no
white
man
will
know
i
do
advise
your
people
to
spend
much
money
on
the
search
odd
the
inquiries
we
get
he
commented
to
ryder
when
the
frenchmen
had
completed
their
courteous
farewells
you
think
the
bank
was
a
bureau
of
information
yesterday
there
was
a
stir
about
two
crazy
lads
who
are
supposed
to
have
joined
the
mecca
pilgrims
in
disguise
of
course
our
clerks
are
copts
and
pick
up
a
bit
and
the
copts
will
talk
i
say
jack
what
are
you
doing
he
broke
off
to
demand
in
astonishment
for
jack
ryder
had
seated
himself
upon
a
divan
and
was
absorbedly
rolling
up
his
trouser
leg
the
dear
egyptian
flea
he
added
not
at
all
i
am
looking
at
my
knees
said
ryder
glumly
i
just
remembered
that
i
have
to
show
them
a
ball
in
masquerade
at
a
hotel
tourist
crowd
how
do
you
think
look
with
one
of
your
scotch
plaidies
atop
he
inquired
feelingly
fascinating
jack
fascinating
said
the
promptly
sardonic
mclean
you
at
a
masquerade
so
that
what
brought
you
to
town
he
cocked
a
taunting
eye
at
him
well
well
she
must
be
a
most
engaging
young
person
you
be
taking
her
out
on
the
desert
with
you
now
like
our
friend
delcassé
a
pleasant
retired
spot
for
a
body
to
have
his
honeymoon
no
distractions
of
society
undiluted
companionship
you
might
say
now
what
made
you
think
she
like
your
knees
he
murmured
contemplatively
are
you
just
a
bit
previous
apt
to
startle
and
frighten
the
lady
oh
go
on
go
on
ryder
exhorted
bitterly
i
like
it
it
better
than
i
can
do
myself
go
on
but
while
you
are
talking
trot
out
your
tartans
something
clannish
now
one
of
those
ancestral
rigs
that
you
are
always
cherishing
rich
and
red
to
set
off
my
dark
handsome
type
set
off
you
be
jack
dear
promised
mclean
dragging
out
a
huge
chest
set
off
you
be
set
off
he
was
and
a
fool
he
felt
himself
that
night
as
he
confronted
his
brilliant
image
in
the
glass
a
scot
of
the
scots
kilted
in
vivid
plaid
a
rakish
cap
on
his
black
hair
a
tartan
draped
across
his
shoulder
short
heavy
stockings
clasping
his
legs
and
low
shoes
gay
with
big
buckles
oh
young
lochinvar
has
come
out
of
the
west
warbled
mclean
merrily
as
he
straightened
the
shoulder
pin
of
silver
and
scotch
topaz
out
of
hades
said
ryder
rather
pointlessly
for
he
felt
it
was
hades
he
was
going
into
chiefly
he
was
concerned
with
his
knees
and
the
striking
contrast
between
their
sheltered
whiteness
and
the
desert
brown
of
his
face
milky
pale
they
gleamed
at
him
from
the
glass
bony
hard
they
flaunted
their
angles
at
every
move
he
was
grateful
that
he
was
not
a
centipede
oh
was
all
for
my
rightful
king
that
i
gaed
the
border
twas
all
for
you
did
tell
me
her
name
now
jack
where
my
mask
ryder
was
muttering
i
say
are
there
any
pockets
in
these
confounded
petticoats
in
the
sporran
man
there
mclean
at
last
withheld
his
hand
from
its
handiwork
jock
you
a
grand
sight
he
pronounced
with
a
special
scottish
burr
if
ye
dinna
win
her
now
now
awa
he
sung
as
ryder
with
a
last
darkling
look
at
his
vivid
image
strode
towards
the
door
he
awa
all
right
and
he
be
back
again
as
soon
as
he
can
make
it
with
this
cheerless
anticipation
of
the
evening
promise
the
departing
one
stalked
like
an
exiled
stuart
to
his
waiting
carriage
for
a
moment
more
mclean
kept
the
ironic
smile
alive
upon
his
lips
as
he
listened
to
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
and
the
harsh
gutturals
of
the
driver
then
the
smile
died
as
he
turned
back
into
the
room
eh
but
would
you
like
it
though
andy
he
said
to
himself
if
some
girl
now
liked
you
enough
to
get
you
to
go
to
one
of
those
damned
things
the
lucky
dog
chapter
ii
masks
and
maskers
moors
and
juliets
and
circassian
slaves
and
knights
at
arms
were
fast
emerging
from
lift
or
cloak
room
and
confronting
each
other
through
their
masks
in
sheepish
defiance
and
curiosity
adventurous
spirits
were
circulating
voices
lowered
and
guarded
began
to
engage
in
nervous
tittering
banter
laughter
belatedly
smothered
flared
to
betrayals
the
orchestra
was
playing
a
viennese
waltz
and
couple
after
couple
slipped
out
upon
the
floor
lounging
against
the
wall
ryder
glowered
mockingly
through
his
mask
holes
at
the
motley
it
was
so
exactly
as
he
had
foreseen
he
was
bored
and
he
was
going
to
be
more
bored
he
was
jostled
and
he
was
going
to
be
more
jostled
he
was
hot
and
he
was
going
to
be
hotter
where
in
the
world
was
jinny
jeffries
he
deserved
he
felt
exhilaratingly
kind
treatment
to
compensate
him
for
this
insanity
he
gazed
about
and
encountering
a
plump
shepherdess
ogling
him
he
stepped
hastily
behind
a
palm
he
fairly
stepped
upon
a
very
small
person
in
black
a
small
person
with
the
black
silk
hubarah
of
the
mohammedan
woman
drawn
down
to
her
very
brows
and
over
the
entire
face
the
black
street
veil
not
a
feature
visible
not
an
eyebrow
not
an
eyelash
not
a
hint
of
the
small
person
herself
except
a
very
small
white
ringed
hand
lifted
as
if
in
defense
of
his
clumsiness
sorry
said
ryder
quickly
and
driven
by
the
instinct
of
reparation
wo
you
dance
a
mute
shake
of
the
head
well
his
duty
was
done
but
something
the
very
lack
of
all
invitation
in
the
black
phantom
made
him
linger
he
repeated
his
request
in
french
from
behind
the
veil
came
a
liquidly
soft
voice
with
a
note
of
mirth
i
understand
the
english
monsieur
it
informed
him
enough
then
to
say
yes
in
it
the
black
phantom
shook
its
head
my
education
alas
has
only
proceeded
to
the
her
speech
was
quaint
unhesitating
but
oddly
inflected
i
regret
but
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
yes
a
gay
character
for
a
masked
ball
indifference
and
pique
swung
ryder
towards
a
geisha
girl
but
a
trace
of
irritation
lingered
and
he
found
her
you
likee
plink
gleisha
singularly
witless
he
tell
mclean
just
how
darned
captivating
his
outfit
was
he
promised
himself
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
a
familiar
pair
of
gray
eyes
smiling
over
the
white
veil
of
an
odalisque
jinny
jeffries
was
wearing
one
of
the
many
costumes
there
that
passed
for
oriental
a
glittering
assemblage
of
turkish
trousers
and
circassian
veils
silver
shawls
and
necklaces
and
wide
bracelets
banding
bare
arms
as
an
effect
it
was
distinctly
successful
ten
thousand
dinars
could
not
pay
for
the
chicken
she
has
eaten
uttered
ryder
appreciatively
in
the
language
of
the
old
slave
market
and
stepped
promptly
ahead
of
a
stout
pantalon
jack
you
did
come
there
was
a
note
in
the
girl
voice
as
if
she
had
disbelieved
in
her
good
fortune
oh
and
beautiful
as
roderick
dhu
did
i
tell
you
that
you
could
find
something
in
that
shop
she
declared
in
triumph
do
you
imagine
that
this
came
out
of
a
costumer
ryder
swung
her
swiftly
out
in
the
fox
trot
before
the
crowd
invaded
the
floor
if
andy
mclean
could
hear
you
why
this
this
is
the
real
thing
the
stuff
who
is
andy
mclean
andrew
is
scotch
single
and
skeptical
he
is
a
great
pal
of
mine
and
also
an
official
of
the
agricultural
bank
which
is
by
way
of
being
a
government
institution
these
are
the
togs
of
his
hieland
grandsire
why
did
you
bring
him
too
dead
unfortunately
grandsires
often
are
i
mean
andrew
mclean
it
would
take
you
my
dear
jinny
to
do
that
you
brought
me
and
i
can
believe
in
anything
after
the
surprise
of
finding
myself
here
jinny
jeffries
laughed
if
i
could
only
believe
what
you
say
oh
you
can
believe
anything
i
say
jack
obligingly
assured
her
i
very
careful
what
i
i
wish
i
were
you
have
to
be
careful
how
you
look
jinny
and
you
ca
help
that
the
lord
who
gave
you
red
hair
must
provide
the
way
to
elude
its
consequences
i
suppose
the
orient
is
exactly
a
manless
sahara
for
you
she
countered
her
bright
eyes
intent
is
it
a
sahara
for
you
jack
the
only
woman
i
have
laid
a
hand
on
in
kindness
or
unkindness
died
before
ptolemy
rebuilt
denderah
that
not
right
no
and
i
thought
it
such
a
virtuous
record
i
mean
jinny
laughed
that
you
really
ought
to
be
seeing
more
of
life
like
do
you
imagine
this
is
a
place
for
seeing
life
why
not
she
retorted
to
the
irony
in
his
voice
it
real
people
not
just
dead
and
gone
things
in
cases
with
their
lives
all
lived
i
do
care
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
very
famous
person
jack
you
ought
to
see
more
of
the
world
you
have
just
been
buried
out
here
for
two
years
ever
since
you
left
college
beneath
his
mask
the
young
man
was
smiling
a
quaint
feminine
notion
that
life
was
to
be
encountered
at
a
masquerade
this
motley
of
hot
wrought
up
idiots
a
human
contact
life
living
thank
you
he
preferred
the
sane
young
english
officials
the
comradeship
of
his
chief
the
glamor
of
his
desert
tombs
of
course
there
was
a
loneliness
in
the
desert
that
was
part
of
the
big
feeling
of
it
the
still
stealing
sense
of
immensity
reaching
out
its
shadowy
hands
for
you
loneliness
and
restlessness
these
tropic
nights
when
the
stars
burned
low
and
bright
and
the
hot
sands
seemed
breathing
loneliness
and
restlessness
but
they
gave
a
man
dreams
and
were
those
dreams
to
be
realized
here
the
music
stopped
and
the
pantalon
bore
down
upon
them
abandoning
jinny
to
her
fate
ryder
sought
refuge
and
a
cigarette
the
hall
was
crowded
now
the
ball
was
a
flash
of
color
a
whirl
of
satins
and
spangles
and
tulle
and
gauze
gold
and
green
and
rose
and
sapphire
gyrating
madly
in
vivid
projection
against
the
black
and
white
stripes
of
the
moorish
walls
the
color
and
the
music
had
sent
their
quickening
reactions
among
the
throng
masks
were
lending
audacity
to
mischief
and
high
spirits
three
little
pierrettes
scampered
through
the
crowd
pelting
right
and
left
with
confetti
and
balloons
and
two
stalwart
monks
and
a
thin
hamlet
pursued
them
keeping
up
the
bombardment
amid
a
great
combustion
of
balloons
a
spangled
harlequin
snatched
his
hands
full
of
confetti
and
darted
behind
a
palm
it
was
the
palm
of
the
black
phantom
the
palm
of
ryder
rebuff
perhaps
the
harlequin
had
met
repulse
here
too
and
cherished
resentment
not
a
very
malicious
resentment
but
a
mocking
feint
of
it
for
when
ryder
turned
sharply
after
him
oddly
he
himself
was
strolling
toward
that
nook
he
found
harlequin
circling
with
mock
entreaties
about
the
stubbornly
refusing
black
domino
will
you
wo
you
will
you
wo
you
wo
you
join
the
dance
chanted
harlequin
with
a
shower
of
confetti
flung
at
the
girl
averted
face
there
was
such
a
shrinking
of
genuine
fright
in
her
withdrawal
that
ryder
had
a
fine
thrill
of
rescue
my
dance
he
declared
laying
an
intervening
hand
on
her
muffled
arm
his
shoulder
crowded
the
harlequin
from
sight
she
raised
her
head
the
black
street
veil
was
flung
back
but
a
black
yashmak
was
hiding
all
but
her
eyes
great
dark
eyes
they
were
deep
as
night
and
soft
as
shadows
arched
with
exquisitely
curved
brows
like
the
sweep
of
wild
birds
wings
the
most
lovely
eyes
that
dreams
could
bring
a
flash
of
relief
shone
through
their
childish
fright
with
sudden
confidence
she
turned
to
ryder
thank
you
my
education
monsieur
has
proceeded
to
the
ts
she
told
him
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
over
her
chagrin
drowned
in
a
burst
of
louder
laughter
from
the
discomfited
harlequin
who
turned
on
his
heel
and
then
bounded
after
fresh
prey
shall
we
dance
or
promenade
asked
ryder
hesitatingly
her
gaze
met
his
red
and
gold
and
green
and
blue
flecks
of
confetti
were
glimmering
like
fishscales
over
her
black
wrap
and
were
even
entangled
drolly
in
the
absurd
lengths
of
her
it
is
if
i
have
not
forgotten
how
to
dance
she
murmured
if
it
is
a
waltz
perhaps
it
was
a
waltz
ryder
had
an
odd
impression
of
her
irresolution
before
with
strange
eagerness
he
swept
her
into
the
music
within
the
clumsy
bulk
of
her
draperies
his
arm
felt
the
slightness
of
her
young
form
she
was
no
more
than
a
child
no
child
either
at
a
masquerade
but
a
fairy
dancing
in
the
moonlight
she
was
a
leaf
blowing
in
the
breeze
she
was
the
very
breeze
and
the
moonlight
and
then
to
his
astonishment
the
dance
was
over
those
moments
had
seemed
no
more
than
one
we
must
have
the
next
he
said
quickly
what
made
you
think
you
had
forgotten
it
is
nearly
four
years
monsieur
since
i
danced
with
a
man
with
a
man
you
have
been
dancing
with
girls
then
she
nodded
at
a
school
at
a
a
sort
of
school
the
black
domino
laughed
with
ruefulness
at
a
very
dull
sort
of
school
to
which
i
hope
you
are
not
to
return
she
made
no
answer
to
that
unless
it
was
a
sigh
that
slipped
out
at
any
rate
he
said
cheerily
you
are
dancing
yes
i
am
dancing
there
was
triumph
in
her
young
voice
triumph
and
faint
defiance
and
gayety
again
in
her
changing
eyes
extraordinary
those
eyes
innocent
audacious
bewildering
to
look
down
into
them
produced
the
oddest
of
excitement
he
took
off
his
mask
masks
were
hindering
things
he
could
see
so
much
better
without
she
too
could
see
better
could
see
him
better
shyly
yet
intently
her
gaze
took
note
of
him
of
the
clean
young
face
bronzed
and
rather
thin
of
the
dark
hair
that
looked
darker
against
the
scarlet
cap
of
the
eyes
that
met
hers
so
often
and
were
so
full
of
contradictory
things
life
and
humor
and
frank
simplicity
and
subtle
eagerness
he
looked
so
young
and
confident
and
handsome
you
are
a
scotchman
slipped
out
from
her
black
yashmak
only
in
costume
i
am
an
american
she
repeated
it
a
little
musingly
i
do
not
think
i
ever
met
an
american
young
man
she
added
i
have
met
old
ones
yes
and
ones
and
the
women
but
a
young
one
no
a
retired
spot
that
school
of
yours
said
ryder
appreciatively
you
are
french
that
is
for
your
imagination
teasingly
she
laughed
i
am
monsieur
only
a
black
domino
it
was
the
loveliest
laugh
ryder
was
instantly
aware
and
the
loveliest
voice
in
the
world
yes
and
the
loveliest
eyes
he
forgot
the
crowd
he
forgot
the
heat
he
forgot
alas
jinny
jeffries
he
was
aware
of
an
intense
exhilaration
a
radiant
sense
of
and
at
the
music
beginning
of
a
small
palm
pressed
again
to
his
a
light
form
within
his
arm
of
shy
enchanting
eyes
out
from
the
shrouding
black
do
put
that
veil
away
he
youthfully
entreated
it
quite
time
the
others
are
almost
all
unmasked
her
glance
about
the
room
returned
to
him
with
mock
plaintiveness
she
shook
her
head
as
they
spun
lightly
about
a
corner
perhaps
monsieur
i
have
an
unfortunate
nose
my
nerves
are
strong
but
why
afflict
them
prankishly
her
eyes
sparkled
up
at
him
over
the
black
veil
that
made
her
a
mystery
enjoy
the
present
monsieur
are
you
enjoying
it
her
lashes
dropped
like
black
butterflies
she
was
a
changeling
of
a
girl
veering
from
gayety
to
shyness
her
gaze
was
now
on
her
wrist
watch
a
slender
blaze
of
platinum
and
diamonds
the
present
yes
she
said
in
a
muffled
little
voice
he
bent
his
head
to
hear
her
through
the
veil
a
tormenting
curiosity
was
assailing
him
it
had
become
not
enough
to
know
that
she
was
young
and
slender
with
enchanting
eyes
and
a
teasing
spirit
of
wit
vaguely
he
had
thought
her
to
be
french
one
of
the
quaint
so
rarely
taken
traveling
but
who
was
she
a
child
at
her
first
ball
but
what
in
the
world
was
she
doing
back
in
the
palms
away
from
her
chaperon
he
realized
even
in
the
cloud
of
his
fascination
that
french
are
not
wonted
to
lurk
about
palms
at
a
ball
was
she
a
little
cinderella
then
slipping
among
the
guests
some
poor
companion
stealing
in
for
fun
she
was
too
young
and
there
was
that
watch
that
glitter
of
diamonds
upon
her
wrist
have
you
just
come
to
cairo
she
shook
her
head
for
some
time
i
have
been
here
up
the
nile
yet
the
nile
no
monsieur
but
you
are
going
that
that
i
do
not
know
sometime
perhaps
she
sounded
guarded
he
hurried
into
revelations
i
am
staying
not
far
from
cairo
myself
i
am
an
excavator
on
an
expedition
from
an
american
museum
ah
you
dig
well
not
personally
but
the
expedition
digs
we
had
some
bully
finds
and
you
came
from
america
to
dig
in
the
sands
the
black
domino
laughed
softly
for
how
long
monsieur
this
is
my
second
year
still
laughing
she
shook
her
shrouded
little
head
at
him
but
i
can
not
understand
what
wonderful
thing
do
you
hope
to
find
what
buried
secret
nothing
half
as
wonderful
as
to
know
who
you
are
he
said
boldly
that
too
is
is
buried
monsieur
but
not
beyond
discovery
he
told
her
very
gayly
and
confidently
and
danced
the
music
out
as
the
last
strains
died
they
paused
for
an
instant
as
if
the
spell
still
bound
them
then
his
arms
fell
slowly
away
and
he
heard
the
girl
draw
a
quick
startled
breath
her
eyes
sped
to
that
tiny
blazing
watch
when
she
lifted
them
he
thought
he
surprised
a
gleam
of
panic
how
fast
is
an
hour
she
said
with
an
excited
little
laugh
time
is
a
a
very
sudden
thing
sudden
indeed
how
long
since
he
had
been
a
badly
bored
impatient
young
man
mocking
the
follies
of
the
masquerade
how
long
since
he
had
danced
with
jinny
flouting
her
notion
of
this
sort
of
thing
as
life
how
long
since
he
had
looked
into
a
pair
of
dark
disquieting
eyes
listened
to
a
gay
little
voice
many
important
things
in
life
happen
suddenly
juliet
happened
very
suddenly
to
romeo
romeo
happened
as
suddenly
to
juliet
but
jack
ryder
was
not
remembering
anything
about
romeo
and
juliet
he
was
watching
that
glance
steal
to
the
wrist
watch
again
then
as
if
with
a
determination
of
the
spirit
they
smiled
up
at
him
monsieur
the
american
said
the
black
domino
you
have
been
most
kind
to
an
an
incognita
of
a
masque
i
hope
that
you
dig
out
of
your
sands
all
the
secrets
that
you
most
desire
you
sound
as
if
you
were
saying
said
jack
ryder
with
quick
denial
in
his
blood
the
smile
in
her
eyes
flickered
perhaps
i
have
kept
you
too
long
from
the
other
guests
he
shook
his
head
they
do
exist
ah
i
will
give
you
the
chance
to
say
such
nice
things
to
them
but
i
never
say
nice
things
unless
i
mean
them
never
monsieur
never
i
am
very
careful
what
i
say
he
assured
her
even
as
he
had
assured
another
girl
in
what
different
meaning
hours
or
centuries
before
you
can
believe
anything
that
i
say
a
young
man
of
character
perhaps
that
goes
with
the
scotch
costume
i
have
read
the
scots
are
a
noble
people
they
have
a
thing
on
the
americans
you
must
know
me
better
and
discover
but
again
her
eyes
had
gone
almost
guiltily
to
that
watch
and
when
she
raised
them
again
they
were
not
smiling
but
very
strangely
resolved
monsieur
it
is
so
hot
if
you
would
get
me
a
glass
of
sherbet
certainly
convention
brought
out
the
assent
convention
turned
him
about
and
marched
him
dutifully
toward
the
crowded
table
she
indicated
but
something
deeper
than
convention
some
warning
born
of
that
consulted
watch
and
that
strange
look
in
her
eyes
that
uneasy
fear
and
swift
resolve
turned
him
quickly
about
again
other
couples
had
strolled
between
them
he
hurried
through
and
stepped
back
among
the
palms
the
place
was
empty
the
black
domino
was
gone
he
wasted
one
minute
in
assuring
himself
that
she
was
not
hidden
in
some
corner
not
mingled
with
the
crowd
but
the
niche
was
deserted
as
a
rifled
nest
then
his
eyes
spied
the
door
that
the
green
decorations
had
conspired
to
hide
and
he
wrenched
it
open
he
found
himself
on
a
little
balcony
overlooking
the
hotel
garden
he
knew
the
place
in
daytime
palms
and
shrubs
and
a
graveled
walk
and
painted
chairs
where
he
had
drunk
tea
with
jinny
and
watched
a
russian
tourist
beautifully
smoking
cigarettes
now
the
place
was
strange
night
and
a
crescent
moon
had
wrought
their
magic
and
the
garden
was
a
mystery
of
velvet
dusks
and
ivory
pallors
the
graveled
path
ran
glimmering
beneath
the
magnolias
over
the
wall
blankness
the
eucalyptus
defined
its
crooked
lines
against
the
blue
egyptian
sky
no
living
thing
was
there
nothing
or
did
that
shadow
stir
there
just
at
the
path
end
ryder
lithe
strength
was
swift
there
was
one
breathless
moment
of
pursuit
then
his
hand
fell
with
gripping
fierceness
upon
the
huddled
dark
figure
that
had
sped
so
frantically
to
the
tiny
door
in
the
garden
end
a
moment
more
and
she
would
have
been
through
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
turned
her
towards
him
her
eyes
met
his
with
a
dash
of
desperation
he
was
unconscious
how
his
own
were
blazing
how
queerly
white
his
face
had
gone
under
its
desert
brown
she
was
actually
running
away
she
had
meant
never
to
see
him
again
he
had
frustrated
her
but
the
blow
she
had
meant
to
deal
him
was
still
felt
his
voice
when
it
came
sounded
shaken
you
were
going
to
leave
me
strangely
her
eyes
changed
the
defiance
the
panic
fear
faded
a
cloud
of
slow
despair
welled
up
in
them
what
else
she
said
very
softly
he
did
not
lose
his
hold
on
her
he
drew
her
back
into
the
shadows
with
involuntary
caution
and
he
felt
her
slender
body
trembling
in
his
grasp
the
tremors
seemed
to
pass
into
his
own
a
sense
of
urgency
was
pressing
upon
him
he
was
not
himself
not
any
self
that
he
had
known
he
stood
there
in
the
egyptian
night
in
the
motley
of
a
scotch
chieftain
grasping
this
mysterious
creature
of
the
masquerade
and
he
heard
a
voice
that
he
did
not
know
ask
of
her
again
and
again
but
why
why
why
were
you
going
it
was
not
he
was
telling
himself
and
her
eyes
were
telling
him
as
if
she
wanted
to
go
he
knew
what
he
knew
those
had
been
enchanted
hours
yet
she
had
deceived
and
fled
from
him
her
eyes
looked
darkly
back
at
him
through
the
dusk
because
i
must
return
to
my
own
life
her
voice
was
a
whisper
and
i
did
not
want
you
to
know
to
know
what
who
are
you
where
were
you
going
a
confusion
of
conjecture
fantastic
horrible
impossible
was
surging
in
him
dim
vague
terrible
things
who
are
you
anyway
she
looked
away
from
him
to
the
door
which
she
had
tried
to
gain
no
masker
monsieur
for
me
there
is
no
unveiling
ryder
hand
stiffened
he
felt
his
blood
stop
a
moment
as
if
his
heart
stood
still
and
then
it
beat
on
again
in
a
furious
turmoil
of
contradiction
of
this
impossible
thing
that
she
was
telling
him
that
door
monsieur
is
to
the
lane
and
in
the
lane
another
door
leads
to
another
garden
the
garden
of
a
girl
you
can
never
know
he
was
no
novice
to
egypt
even
while
his
credulity
was
still
battling
with
belief
his
mind
had
realized
this
thing
that
had
happened
the
astounding
unbelievable
thing
he
had
heard
something
of
those
turkish
girls
daughters
of
rich
officials
whose
lives
were
such
strange
opposition
of
modernity
and
tradition
indulgence
and
luxury
french
governesses
and
french
frocks
freedom
travel
often
paris
london
perhaps
and
then
as
the
girl
eclipses
the
child
the
veil
still
indulgence
and
luxury
still
books
and
governesses
and
frocks
and
motors
and
society
but
a
feminine
society
not
a
man
in
it
not
a
caller
not
a
friend
not
a
lover
not
an
interview
even
with
the
man
who
is
to
be
the
husband
until
the
bride
is
safe
in
the
husband
home
hidden
women
secret
secluded
lives
extinguished
by
tradition
a
tradition
against
which
their
earlier
years
only
had
won
modern
emancipation
and
she
this
slim
creature
in
the
black
domino
one
of
those
invisibles
stark
amazement
looked
out
of
his
eyes
into
hers
you
a
turk
he
blurted
i
a
turk
her
head
went
suddenly
high
she
stiffened
with
defensive
pride
i
am
ashamed
but
for
the
thing
i
have
done
that
is
a
shameful
thing
to
steal
out
at
night
to
a
hotel
to
a
ball
and
to
dance
with
a
man
to
tell
him
who
i
am
oh
yes
i
am
much
ashamed
i
am
as
bold
as
a
christian
she
tossed
at
him
suddenly
between
mockery
and
malice
still
his
wonder
and
his
trouble
found
no
words
and
the
shadow
on
his
face
was
reflected
swiftly
in
her
own
i
beg
you
to
believe
monsieur
that
never
before
never
have
i
done
such
a
thing
my
greatest
fault
was
to
be
out
in
the
garden
after
sunset
when
all
moslem
women
should
be
within
but
my
nurse
was
indulgent
almost
pleadingly
she
looked
up
at
the
young
man
believe
this
of
me
monsieur
i
would
not
have
you
think
of
me
lightly
but
something
possessed
me
i
had
heard
of
the
masque
and
i
remembered
the
balls
of
the
embassy
where
i
danced
when
i
was
so
young
and
so
i
slipped
away
there
was
a
garden
key
that
i
had
stolen
long
ago
and
kept
for
another
thing
i
did
not
mean
to
dance
only
to
look
on
at
the
world
again
oh
my
good
lord
said
jack
ryder
and
then
suddenly
he
asked
are
you
do
you
whom
do
you
live
with
and
when
she
answered
in
surprise
but
with
whom
but
my
father
he
is
tewfick
pasha
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
thought
you
tell
me
next
you
were
married
he
said
limply
the
next
moment
they
were
laughing
the
sudden
incredibly
absorbed
laughter
of
youth
no
husband
i
am
one
of
the
young
revoltées
the
moderns
and
i
am
the
only
daughter
of
a
most
indulgent
father
well
that
something
to
the
good
was
ryder
comment
upon
that
he
added
but
if
that
most
indulgent
father
caught
you
he
looked
down
at
her
the
secret
trouble
of
her
answering
look
told
him
more
than
its
assumption
of
courage
this
was
no
boarding
school
girl
lingering
beyond
hours
this
was
a
moslem
risking
more
than
he
could
well
know
the
escapade
was
suddenly
serious
tremendously
menacing
she
answered
faintly
i
have
no
idea
the
thing
is
so
impossible
but
of
course
she
rallied
her
spirit
to
protest
i
do
not
think
they
would
sew
me
in
a
sack
with
a
stone
and
drop
me
in
the
river
like
the
odalisques
of
yesterday
she
added
her
voice
uncertain
in
spite
of
her
i
meant
only
to
stay
a
moment
which
is
the
way
said
jack
briefly
with
caution
he
opened
the
gate
into
the
black
canyon
of
the
lane
silence
and
darkness
not
a
loiterer
only
one
of
the
furtive
starved
dogs
slinking
back
from
some
rubbish
the
girl
moved
forward
and
keeping
closely
at
her
side
he
followed
they
crossed
to
the
other
wall
and
turned
towards
the
right
stopping
before
the
deeper
shadow
of
a
small
pointed
door
set
into
the
heavy
brick
of
the
high
wall
from
her
draperies
the
girl
drew
out
a
huge
key
she
fitted
it
into
the
ancient
lock
and
turned
it
carefully
she
pressed
open
the
gate
and
stared
anxiously
into
the
gloom
of
the
shadowy
garden
that
it
disclosed
relief
colored
her
voice
as
she
turned
to
him
all
is
quiet
i
am
safe
now
and
so
monsieur
and
this
is
where
you
live
ryder
whispered
there
in
that
wing
she
murmured
slipping
within
the
gate
and
he
stole
after
her
and
looked
across
the
garden
through
a
fringe
of
date
palms
to
the
outlines
of
the
buildings
dim
and
dark
showed
the
high
walls
black
as
a
prison
only
here
and
there
the
pale
orange
oblong
of
a
lighted
window
did
you
climb
out
the
window
he
murmured
from
beneath
the
veil
came
a
little
sound
of
soft
derision
but
there
are
always
bars
even
in
the
garden
windows
of
the
haremlik
no
i
stole
down
by
an
old
stair
that
wing
there
on
the
right
barred
on
the
garden
and
on
the
street
the
impregnable
wooden
screens
of
the
mashrubiyeh
those
were
the
rooms
where
this
girl
beside
him
was
to
spend
her
life
until
that
most
indulgent
father
wearied
of
her
modernity
and
transferred
her
to
other
rooms
as
barred
and
screened
in
the
palace
of
some
husband
that
thought
was
brushing
ryder
with
other
thoughts
of
her
present
risk
of
her
lovely
eyes
visible
again
above
the
veil
thoughts
of
the
strangeness
and
unreality
of
it
all
there
in
the
shrubbery
of
a
pasha
garden
the
pasha
daughter
whispering
at
his
side
what
about
your
mother
he
asked
her
is
she
she
is
dead
the
girl
told
him
with
a
drop
in
her
voice
and
after
a
long
moment
of
silence
when
i
was
so
little
but
i
remember
her
oh
indeed
i
do
she
was
french
monsieur
oh
and
so
you
i
am
she
whispered
back
that
is
very
often
so
in
the
harems
of
cairo
she
was
so
lovely
said
the
girl
wistfully
my
father
must
have
loved
her
very
much
he
never
brought
another
wife
here
always
i
lived
alone
with
my
old
nurse
and
the
governesses
you
had
lessons
oh
nothing
but
lessons
all
of
that
world
which
was
shut
away
so
soon
french
and
english
and
music
and
the
philosophy
oh
we
turks
are
what
you
call
blue
stockings
monsieur
shut
away
with
our
books
and
our
dreams
and
our
memories
we
are
so
young
and
already
the
real
world
is
a
memory
sometimes
she
said
with
a
tremor
of
suppressed
passion
in
her
still
little
tones
i
could
wish
that
i
had
died
when
i
was
very
young
and
so
happy
when
my
father
took
me
traveling
in
europe
i
played
games
on
the
decks
of
the
ships
i
had
my
tea
with
the
english
children
i
went
down
into
the
hold
to
play
with
their
dogs
she
broke
off
between
a
laugh
and
a
sigh
dogs
are
forbidden
to
moslems
but
of
course
you
know
if
you
have
been
here
two
years
and
emancipated
as
we
may
be
there
is
no
changing
the
customs
we
must
live
as
our
grandmothers
lived
though
we
are
not
as
our
grandmothers
are
with
a
french
mother
you
must
be
very
far
from
what
some
of
your
grandmothers
were
my
poor
french
mother
whimsically
the
girl
sighed
must
i
blame
it
on
her
the
spirit
that
took
me
to
the
ball
this
will
be
a
dream
to
me
i
shall
not
believe
in
my
shamelessness
and
you
too
must
forget
forget
said
ryder
under
his
breath
forget
and
go
positively
you
must
go
now
monsieur
it
is
very
dangerous
here
it
is
there
was
a
light
dancing
in
his
hazel
eyes
it
is
more
dangerous
every
moment
but
i
mean
her
confusion
betrayed
itself
but
i
mean
that
you
are
magic
black
magic
he
murmured
bending
over
the
black
domino
the
crescent
moon
had
found
its
way
through
a
filigree
of
boughs
faintly
its
exploring
ray
lighted
the
contour
of
that
shrouded
head
touched
the
lovely
curves
of
her
arched
brows
and
the
tender
pallor
of
the
skin
about
those
great
wells
of
dark
eyes
from
his
own
eyes
a
flame
seemed
to
pass
into
hers
breathlessly
they
gazed
at
each
other
like
dim
shadows
in
a
garden
of
still
enchantment
and
then
as
from
a
palpable
clasp
she
tried
to
slip
away
truly
i
must
go
it
is
so
late
ryder
heart
was
pounding
within
him
he
did
not
recognize
this
state
of
affairs
it
was
utterly
unrelated
to
anything
that
had
gone
before
in
his
merry
humorous
rather
and
wary
young
life
he
felt
dazed
and
wondering
at
himself
and
irresponsible
and
appalled
but
deeper
than
all
else
he
felt
eager
and
exultant
and
strangely
furtively
determined
about
something
that
he
was
not
owning
to
himself
something
that
leaped
off
his
lips
in
the
low
murmur
to
her
but
night
i
shall
see
you
again
she
caught
her
breath
oh
never
again
has
no
outside
this
gate
he
persisted
i
shall
wait
and
other
nights
after
that
for
i
must
know
if
you
are
safe
see
i
am
very
safe
now
for
if
i
were
missed
there
would
be
running
and
confusion
he
only
drew
a
little
closer
to
her
night
or
another
i
shall
come
to
this
door
it
must
not
open
to
you
it
is
a
forbidden
door
forbidden
as
that
fortieth
door
in
the
old
story
there
are
thirty
and
nine
doors
in
your
life
monsieur
that
you
may
open
but
this
is
the
forbidden
i
shall
be
waiting
he
insisted
night
or
another
she
moved
her
head
in
denial
neither
nor
another
night
again
their
eyes
met
he
bent
over
her
he
knew
a
gleam
of
sharpest
wonder
at
himself
as
his
arms
went
swiftly
round
that
shrouding
drapery
and
then
all
duality
of
consciousness
was
blotted
out
in
the
rush
of
his
young
madness
for
within
that
drapery
was
the
soft
human
sweetness
of
her
his
arms
tightened
his
face
bent
close
and
through
the
sheer
gauze
of
her
veil
his
lips
pressed
her
lips
some
one
was
coming
down
the
walk
footsteps
crunched
the
gravel
like
a
wraith
the
girl
was
out
of
his
arms
in
anger
or
alarm
his
whirling
senses
could
not
know
although
it
was
their
passionate
concern
but
his
last
gleam
of
prudence
got
him
through
the
gate
he
heard
her
locking
after
and
then
for
her
sake
he
fled
chapter
iii
in
the
pasha
palace
nearer
sounded
the
footsteps
on
the
graveled
walk
and
in
frightened
haste
the
girl
drew
out
the
key
from
the
gate
and
slipped
away
into
the
shrubbery
grateful
for
the
blotting
shadows
at
the
foot
of
a
rose
bush
she
crouched
to
thrust
the
key
into
a
hole
in
the
loose
earth
covering
the
top
and
drawing
the
low
branches
over
it
aimée
came
a
guarded
call
aimée
still
stooping
she
tried
to
steal
through
the
bushes
but
the
thorns
held
her
and
she
stood
up
pulling
at
her
robes
yes
miriam
she
said
faintly
and
desperately
freeing
herself
she
hurried
forward
towards
the
dark
bulky
figure
of
her
old
nurse
emerging
now
into
the
moonlight
glory
to
god
ejaculated
the
old
woman
but
cautiously
under
her
breath
come
quickly
he
is
here
thy
father
and
thou
in
the
garden
at
this
hour
but
come
and
urgently
she
gripped
the
girl
wrist
as
if
afraid
that
she
would
vanish
again
into
the
shadows
of
the
shrubbery
aimée
felt
her
knees
quake
under
her
my
father
she
murmured
and
her
voice
died
in
her
throat
had
he
discovered
had
some
one
seen
her
slip
out
or
recognized
her
at
the
ball
the
conjectures
surged
through
her
in
dismaying
confusion
she
tried
to
beat
down
her
fear
to
think
quickly
to
rally
her
force
but
her
swimming
senses
were
still
invaded
with
the
surprise
of
those
last
moments
at
the
gate
her
heart
still
beating
with
the
touch
of
ryder
arms
about
her
of
that
long
deep
look
that
kiss
beyond
all
else
that
kiss
little
rivers
of
fire
were
running
through
her
veins
shame
and
proud
anger
set
up
their
swift
reactions
oh
what
wings
of
wild
incredible
folly
had
brought
her
to
this
to
be
kissed
like
like
a
dancing
girl
by
a
man
an
unknown
an
american
how
could
he
how
could
he
after
all
his
kindness
to
hold
her
so
lightly
and
yet
there
had
been
no
lightness
in
his
eyes
those
eager
shining
young
eyes
so
gravely
concerned
but
she
could
not
stop
to
think
of
this
thing
her
father
was
waiting
he
came
in
like
a
fury
the
old
nurse
was
panting
as
they
scurried
up
the
walk
together
and
asked
for
you
and
your
room
empty
your
bed
not
touched
oh
allah
ruth
upon
me
i
went
trotting
through
the
house
mad
with
fear
up
to
the
roofs
then
down
to
the
garden
sending
him
word
that
you
were
dressing
that
he
should
not
know
the
only
child
of
his
house
was
a
shameless
one
devoid
of
sense
but
there
is
no
harm
in
a
garden
breathed
the
girl
her
face
hot
with
shame
was
so
hot
is
there
no
coolth
upon
the
roof
but
the
roses
can
roses
not
be
brought
you
have
you
no
maids
to
attend
you
i
am
tired
of
being
attended
can
i
never
be
alone
alone
in
the
garden
a
pretty
talk
eh
i
will
tell
thy
father
i
will
have
a
stop
put
to
this
would
you
have
him
hear
she
admonished
in
a
sudden
whisper
as
they
opened
the
little
door
at
the
foot
of
the
dark
well
of
spiral
steps
like
conspirators
they
fled
up
the
staircase
and
then
with
fumbling
haste
the
old
nurse
dragged
off
the
girl
mantle
and
veil
muttering
at
the
pins
that
secured
it
she
shook
out
the
chiffon
of
her
rumpled
frock
and
gathered
back
a
strand
of
her
dark
disordered
hair
say
that
you
were
on
the
roofs
she
besought
her
for
a
moment
the
girl
put
the
warm
rose
of
her
cheek
against
the
old
woman
dark
wrinkled
one
but
you
are
good
dadi
she
said
softly
using
the
turkish
word
for
familiar
old
servants
with
a
sound
of
mingled
vexation
and
affection
miriam
pushed
her
ahead
of
her
into
the
it
was
a
long
dark
room
on
whose
soft
buff
carpet
the
little
gilt
chairs
and
sofas
were
set
about
with
the
empty
expectancy
of
a
stage
scene
in
a
french
salon
french
were
the
shirred
silk
shades
upon
the
electric
lamps
french
the
music
upon
the
chic
rosewood
piano
and
then
as
if
some
careless
property
man
had
overlooked
them
in
changing
the
act
two
window
balconies
of
closely
carved
old
wood
of
solidly
screening
mashrubiyeh
wood
jutted
out
from
one
wall
and
above
a
gilded
sofa
upholstered
in
the
delicate
fabric
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
hung
a
green
satin
banner
embroidered
in
silver
with
a
phrase
from
the
koran
tewfick
pasha
was
at
one
side
of
the
room
filling
his
match
case
he
was
in
evening
dress
a
ribbon
of
some
order
across
a
rather
swelling
shirt
bosom
a
red
fez
upon
his
dark
head
at
his
daughter
entrance
he
turned
quickly
with
so
sharp
a
gleam
from
his
full
somewhat
protuberant
black
eyes
that
her
guilty
heart
fairly
turned
over
in
her
it
made
matters
no
more
comforting
to
have
miriam
packed
from
the
room
she
would
deny
it
all
she
thought
desperately
no
she
would
admit
it
and
implore
his
indulgence
she
would
admit
nothing
but
the
garden
she
would
admit
the
ball
she
would
admit
the
young
man
with
conscious
eyes
and
flushing
cheeks
woefully
aware
of
satin
slippers
and
an
upsettingly
hammering
heart
aimée
presented
the
young
image
of
irresolute
confusion
to
her
surprise
there
was
no
outburst
her
father
was
suddenly
gay
and
smiling
with
a
flow
of
pleasant
phrases
that
invited
her
affection
in
his
good
humor
and
tewfick
pasha
liked
always
to
be
kept
in
good
humor
he
had
touches
of
that
boyish
charm
that
had
made
him
the
of
paris
and
vienna
as
well
as
cairo
and
constantinople
an
no
more
in
the
robustly
rotund
forties
his
cheerful
demanded
still
of
his
environment
that
smiling
acquiescence
that
kept
life
soft
and
comfortable
and
now
it
suddenly
struck
aimée
through
her
tense
alarm
that
his
smile
was
not
a
spontaneous
smile
but
was
silently
uneasily
asking
his
daughter
not
to
make
something
too
unpleasant
for
him
that
something
that
had
brought
him
here
at
an
unprecedented
midnight
that
had
kept
him
waiting
until
she
supposedly
should
rise
and
dress
if
it
were
not
then
a
knowledge
of
her
escapade
the
relief
from
that
fear
made
everything
else
bearable
she
was
even
able
to
entertain
with
a
certain
welcome
the
alternative
alarm
that
he
had
decided
to
marry
again
that
nightmare
from
whose
realization
the
unknown
gods
or
more
truly
the
unknown
goddesses
of
the
cairene
had
assisted
to
save
her
there
was
a
furtive
excitement
about
him
that
fanned
the
supposition
then
quite
suddenly
the
illuminating
lightning
cut
the
clouds
my
dear
child
i
have
news
really
important
news
for
you
if
i
have
not
been
discussing
your
future
said
tewfick
pasha
staring
with
stern
nonchalance
ahead
and
determinedly
unaware
of
her
instant
stiffening
of
attention
i
have
by
no
means
been
neglectful
of
it
indeed
there
has
been
a
consummation
of
my
plans
it
is
not
to
every
daughter
that
a
father
may
hurry
with
such
an
announcement
her
first
feeling
was
a
merciful
relief
he
knew
nothing
then
of
the
ball
she
could
breathe
again
it
was
her
marriage
that
had
brought
him
no
new
danger
that
but
the
eternal
menace
that
she
had
always
to
dread
but
how
many
times
had
he
promised
that
she
should
have
no
unknown
husband
imposed
by
tradition
how
many
times
had
she
indulged
dreams
of
europe
of
bright
free
romance
and
now
he
was
off
on
some
tangent
from
which
it
would
need
all
her
coaxing
wit
to
divert
him
with
wide
eyes
painfully
intent
her
little
jeweled
fingers
very
still
in
their
locked
grip
in
her
lap
the
color
draining
from
her
cheeks
she
sat
waiting
for
the
revelation
what
was
it
all
had
he
really
decided
upon
something
upon
some
one
tewfick
pasha
appeared
in
no
hurry
to
inform
her
he
wandered
rather
confusedly
into
a
rambling
speech
about
her
age
and
her
position
and
the
responsibilities
of
life
and
his
inabilities
to
prevent
their
reaching
her
and
about
his
very
tender
affection
for
her
and
his
understanding
of
all
those
girlish
reticences
and
reluctances
which
made
innocent
youth
so
exquisite
while
silently
his
daughter
hung
her
head
and
wondered
what
he
would
be
saying
if
he
knew
that
she
had
broken
every
canon
of
seclusion
and
convention
had
talked
and
danced
with
a
man
his
astonishment
would
be
so
horrific
that
she
flinched
even
from
the
thought
and
if
he
knew
moreover
that
this
man
had
caught
her
and
kissed
her
she
told
herself
that
she
was
disgraced
for
life
she
had
a
dreamy
desire
to
close
her
eyes
and
lean
back
and
dream
on
about
that
disgrace
but
she
must
listen
to
her
father
he
was
talking
now
about
the
powers
of
wealth
not
merely
the
nominal
riches
of
his
somewhat
precarious
political
affiliations
but
solid
sustaining
invested
and
invulnerable
wealth
unexpectedly
aimée
laughed
he
must
be
very
plain
she
declared
her
face
brightening
with
mockery
if
you
take
so
long
to
tell
me
his
name
not
she
added
to
herself
under
her
breath
that
any
name
would
weigh
a
feather
difference
on
the
contrary
and
the
pasha
eyes
met
hers
frankly
for
the
first
time
and
he
seemed
delighted
to
indulge
a
laugh
he
has
the
reputation
of
good
looks
he
is
much
la
beautiful
and
golden
did
you
meet
him
just
my
father
aimée
went
on
in
that
light
audacity
which
he
had
loved
to
indulge
now
he
smiled
but
his
glance
went
uneasily
away
from
her
not
at
all
this
is
a
serious
affair
you
understand
the
devil
of
a
serious
affair
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
she
heard
the
accents
of
his
candor
but
again
he
was
back
to
voluble
protestation
this
man
was
really
an
old
friend
he
boggled
over
the
word
then
got
it
out
resonantly
a
man
he
knew
well
not
a
young
man
perhaps
certainly
he
was
not
going
to
hand
his
only
daughter
to
any
boy
a
mere
novice
in
life
but
a
man
who
could
give
her
the
position
she
deserved
not
only
a
rich
man
but
an
influential
one
his
name
he
brought
out
at
last
was
hamdi
bey
he
was
a
general
in
the
armies
of
the
sultan
it
was
a
long
moment
before
she
could
piece
any
shreds
of
recollection
together
hamdi
bey
a
general
why
that
was
a
man
her
father
had
disliked
more
than
once
he
had
dropped
resentful
phrases
of
his
airs
his
arrogance
had
recounted
certain
clashes
with
malicious
joy
and
now
he
was
planning
no
seriously
announcing
a
general
he
must
be
terribly
old
not
that
it
made
any
difference
old
or
young
black
or
white
general
or
ghikar
would
mean
nothing
in
her
life
she
would
have
none
of
him
none
of
him
never
would
she
endure
the
humiliation
of
being
handed
over
like
a
toy
an
odalisque
a
slave
what
had
happened
she
could
only
suppose
that
her
father
had
been
overcome
by
that
wealth
of
the
general
on
which
he
had
made
her
such
a
speech
or
perhaps
his
dislike
of
hamdi
had
been
founded
on
nothing
but
resentment
of
hamdi
airs
of
superiority
and
now
that
the
bey
was
condescending
to
ask
for
her
hand
her
father
flattered
appeasement
was
rushing
into
genial
acceptance
anything
might
be
possible
to
tewfick
pasha
eternally
youthful
enthusiasms
she
told
her
frightened
heart
that
she
was
not
afraid
her
father
would
never
really
fail
her
and
she
would
never
surrender
to
this
degradation
for
all
her
fright
and
all
her
flinching
from
defiance
she
divined
in
herself
some
hidden
stuff
of
resistance
tenacious
to
endure
some
strain
of
daring
which
had
made
her
brave
that
wild
escapade
was
it
still
the
same
night
were
the
violins
still
playing
the
people
still
dancing
in
their
fairy
land
of
freedom
was
that
young
man
in
the
highland
dress
that
unknown
american
was
he
back
there
dancing
with
some
other
girl
what
was
it
he
had
said
night
and
another
night
he
would
be
there
in
the
lane
if
she
would
come
as
if
she
would
demean
herself
after
his
rude
affront
to
steal
again
to
the
gate
like
a
gardener
daughter
her
thoughts
were
so
full
of
him
and
now
she
had
this
new
horror
to
face
this
marriage
to
hamdi
bey
did
her
father
dream
that
she
would
not
resist
it
was
against
such
a
danger
that
she
had
long
ago
stolen
a
garden
key
a
key
to
the
outer
world
in
which
she
had
neither
a
friend
nor
a
piaster
to
save
her
my
dear
father
she
said
entreatingly
please
do
not
tell
me
that
you
really
mean
that
you
really
think
you
would
like
to
that
you
would
consider
this
man
he
turned
on
her
a
suddenly
direct
confessing
look
aimée
i
have
this
matter
he
added
heavily
that
is
what
i
came
to
tell
you
in
the
silence
that
settled
upon
them
he
finally
ceased
his
effort
to
ignore
her
shocked
dismay
he
abandoned
his
airy
pretense
that
the
affair
could
possibly
evoke
her
enthusiasm
he
sucked
at
his
cigarette
like
a
rather
sullen
little
boy
i
have
always
indulged
you
aimée
he
said
at
last
without
looking
round
at
her
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
make
me
infernally
sorry
i
think
you
are
me
sorry
said
an
unsteady
little
voice
he
looked
about
his
daughter
was
sitting
very
still
upon
the
gilded
sofa
beneath
the
banner
of
mahomet
as
he
regarded
her
two
great
tears
formed
in
her
dark
eyes
and
ran
slowly
down
her
cheeks
with
a
sound
of
impatience
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
this
he
pointed
out
heatedly
to
her
was
what
a
man
got
who
indulged
his
daughter
this
is
what
came
of
french
and
english
governesses
and
modern
ideas
after
all
he
had
done
more
than
any
other
father
to
sit
and
weep
weep
at
such
a
marriage
what
did
she
expect
of
life
was
she
not
as
other
women
did
she
never
look
ahead
had
she
no
pride
no
ambition
no
hopes
did
she
wish
never
to
marry
then
to
become
an
like
her
english
companion
i
am
but
eighteen
she
said
quiveringly
oh
my
father
do
not
give
me
to
this
unknown
unknown
unknown
do
i
not
know
him
but
you
promised
angrily
he
gestured
with
his
cigarette
do
i
know
what
is
good
for
you
or
do
i
not
have
i
your
interest
at
heart
tell
me
am
i
a
savage
a
dolt
but
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
unhappy
i
beg
of
you
my
father
i
should
die
with
such
a
life
before
me
with
such
a
man
for
my
husband
i
am
too
french
too
like
my
mother
ah
your
mother
too
french
are
you
but
what
would
you
have
in
france
he
demanded
with
the
bursting
appearance
of
a
man
making
every
effort
to
restrain
himself
within
unreasonable
bounds
would
not
your
parents
there
arrange
your
marriage
you
might
see
the
fiancé
he
caught
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
but
only
for
a
time
or
two
after
the
arrangements
and
what
is
that
what
more
would
you
know
than
what
your
father
knows
are
you
a
thing
to
be
exhibited
given
to
a
man
to
gaze
at
and
appraise
i
tell
you
no
you
are
my
daughter
you
bear
my
name
and
when
you
marry
you
marry
in
the
sanctity
of
the
custom
of
your
father
and
you
go
to
your
husband
house
as
his
mother
went
to
his
father
timidly
she
protested
but
my
mother
and
you
do
not
speak
of
your
mother
if
she
were
here
she
would
counsel
gratitude
and
obedience
he
turned
his
back
on
her
this
is
what
comes
he
muttered
of
this
modernity
this
education
he
pitched
away
his
stub
as
if
he
were
casting
all
that
he
hated
away
with
it
she
had
never
seen
him
so
angry
helplessly
she
felt
that
his
vanity
and
his
word
were
engaged
with
the
general
more
than
she
had
dreamed
she
felt
a
surge
of
panic
at
the
immensity
of
the
trouble
before
her
but
my
father
if
you
love
me
no
my
little
one
if
love
with
a
sudden
assumption
of
good
humor
over
the
angry
red
mottling
his
olive
cheeks
he
came
and
sat
beside
her
putting
his
arm
about
her
silently
shrinking
figure
i
am
a
weak
fool
to
stay
and
drink
a
woman
tears
as
the
saying
goes
he
told
her
but
this
is
what
a
man
gets
for
being
good
natured
but
tears
or
not
i
know
what
is
best
come
aimée
have
i
not
ever
been
fond
of
you
he
patted
her
hand
with
his
own
plump
one
where
bright
rings
were
sparkling
deep
in
the
encroaching
flesh
aimée
looked
down
with
a
sudden
wild
dislike
that
soft
ingratiating
hand
with
its
dimples
and
polished
nails
which
thought
it
could
pat
her
so
easily
into
submission
it
was
nothing
to
him
she
thought
chokingly
whether
she
was
happy
or
unhappy
he
had
decided
on
the
match
perhaps
he
had
foreseen
her
protests
and
plunged
into
it
so
as
to
be
committed
against
her
entreaties
and
he
was
not
stopped
by
any
thought
of
her
feelings
after
all
her
hopes
after
all
he
had
promised
but
she
told
herself
that
she
had
never
been
secure
beneath
all
her
trust
there
had
always
been
the
silent
fear
slipping
through
the
shadows
like
a
serpent
some
instinct
for
character
more
precocious
than
her
years
had
whispered
through
her
fond
blindness
and
initiated
her
into
foreboding
come
now
my
dear
he
said
heartily
this
is
a
surprise
of
course
but
after
all
you
will
find
it
is
for
the
best
much
for
the
best
his
voice
died
away
after
a
long
pause
you
may
make
the
arrangements
she
told
him
in
a
still
tenacious
little
voice
but
you
can
not
make
me
marry
him
i
will
never
put
on
the
marriage
dress
never
wear
the
diadem
never
stir
one
step
within
his
house
a
complete
silence
succeeded
this
declaration
he
got
up
violently
from
beside
her
she
did
not
dare
look
at
him
he
was
going
away
she
thought
it
would
be
the
beginning
of
war
she
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
but
she
knew
that
she
would
endure
it
and
the
gossip
of
the
harems
would
be
her
protection
her
opposition
bruited
through
those
feminine
channels
would
not
be
long
in
reaching
hamdi
bey
and
no
man
could
be
so
callous
of
his
pride
or
the
world
opinion
that
he
would
be
willing
to
receive
such
a
revolting
bride
did
her
father
think
of
that
that
poor
pale
power
of
hers
he
stood
irresolute
as
if
meditating
a
last
exhortation
and
then
suddenly
turned
on
her
the
haggard
face
of
a
violent
despair
would
you
see
me
ruined
he
said
passionately
sharply
he
glanced
about
the
room
at
the
far
closed
doors
where
it
was
not
inconceivable
that
old
miriam
was
lurking
and
strode
over
to
her
and
began
talking
very
jerkily
and
huskily
over
her
bent
head
i
tell
you
that
hamdi
is
making
this
a
condition
it
is
the
price
of
silence
of
those
papers
back
he
came
to
me
i
knew
that
hound
of
satan
had
been
smelling
about
but
i
could
not
imagine
as
if
between
gentlemen
at
that
she
lifted
her
stupefied
head
her
father
with
the
face
of
a
cornered
fox
she
caught
her
breath
with
the
shock
of
it
her
lips
parted
but
only
her
mute
eyes
asked
their
startled
questions
hurriedly
shamefacedly
with
angry
resentments
and
he
was
pouring
a
flood
of
broken
phrases
at
her
she
caught
unintelligible
references
to
narrow
laws
and
the
imbecile
english
to
impositions
binding
only
upon
the
fools
and
then
the
word
sharply
then
the
truth
took
its
outlines
her
father
had
been
smuggling
in
hasheesh
hamdi
bey
had
discovered
this
and
hamdi
bey
unless
silenced
had
threatened
betrayal
the
danger
was
real
english
laws
were
stringent
vaguely
the
horrors
loomed
arrest
trial
even
if
he
escaped
the
scandal
was
ruin
small
wonder
that
her
father
had
come
flying
upon
the
wings
of
his
danger
and
its
deliverance
small
wonder
that
his
brow
was
wet
and
his
lips
dry
and
his
eyes
hard
with
terror
thrown
to
the
winds
now
his
pretense
of
affection
for
hamdi
bey
he
hated
and
feared
him
the
old
fox
had
done
this
he
declared
to
get
a
hold
upon
him
for
always
there
had
been
bad
blood
and
the
bey
had
heard
of
course
of
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
some
cousin
had
babbled
and
undoubtedly
the
rumor
of
that
beauty
tewfick
pasha
received
his
inspiration
upon
the
moment
but
that
was
not
gainsaying
its
truth
had
determined
the
bey
to
find
some
vulnerable
hold
he
was
like
that
a
sardonic
devil
and
this
accursed
business
of
the
hasheesh
had
served
his
ends
he
had
come
with
his
proofs
so
you
see
muttered
tewfick
pasha
what
the
devil
of
a
serious
business
this
is
and
how
any
talk
of
of
unreadiness
if
you
were
not
amiable
for
example
to
his
cousin
when
she
calls
upon
you
might
serve
to
anger
him
and
so
significantly
his
glance
met
hers
her
eyes
fell
stricken
the
color
flooded
her
trembling
face
she
quivered
with
confused
pain
with
shame
for
his
shame
with
terror
and
fright
with
a
hot
protective
compassion
that
tore
at
her
pride
she
struggled
against
her
dismay
trying
for
reassuring
little
words
that
would
not
come
her
heart
seemed
beating
thickly
in
her
throat
she
never
knew
just
what
she
said
what
little
broken
words
of
pity
of
understanding
of
promise
she
achieved
but
her
father
suddenly
dropped
beside
her
with
an
abandon
reminiscent
of
the
of
his
paris
days
and
drew
her
hands
to
his
lips
kissing
their
soft
quiescent
palms
she
drew
one
away
and
placed
it
upon
his
dark
head
from
which
the
fez
had
tumbled
for
the
moment
she
was
sorry
as
one
is
sorry
for
a
hurt
child
and
her
sorriness
held
her
heart
warm
in
the
glow
of
giving
comfort
she
had
need
of
that
warmth
for
a
cold
tide
was
rising
in
her
a
tide
of
chill
irresistible
foreboding
for
all
the
years
of
her
life
for
all
the
years
chapter
iv
explanations
the
remaining
hours
of
jack
ryder
night
might
be
divided
into
three
periods
there
was
an
interval
of
astounding
exhilaration
coupled
with
complete
mental
vacancy
during
which
a
figure
in
a
scots
costume
might
have
been
observed
by
the
astonished
egyptian
moon
striding
obliviously
along
the
silent
road
to
the
nile
past
sleeping
camels
and
snoring
merchants
a
period
during
which
his
sole
distinguishable
sensation
was
the
memory
of
enchanting
eyes
of
a
voice
low
and
lovely
of
a
slender
figure
in
a
muffling
tcharchaf
of
the
touch
of
soft
lips
beneath
a
gauzy
veil
this
period
was
succeeded
by
hours
of
utter
incredulity
in
which
he
lay
on
the
sleeping
porch
of
mclean
domicile
and
stared
into
the
white
cloud
of
his
fly
net
and
questioned
high
heaven
and
himself
had
he
really
done
this
had
he
actually
caught
and
kissed
this
girl
this
girl
whose
name
he
did
not
know
whose
face
he
had
never
seen
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
but
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
turk
and
utterly
forbidden
by
every
canon
of
sanity
and
in
the
name
of
wonder
what
had
possessed
him
the
night
the
moon
the
mystery
of
the
unknown
if
he
had
never
really
kissed
her
he
might
have
convinced
himself
that
he
had
never
really
wanted
to
but
having
kissed
her
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
stranger
a
stranger
of
whom
he
would
be
remarkably
wary
in
the
days
and
nights
to
come
but
a
stranger
for
whom
he
entertained
a
sort
of
secret
amazed
respect
there
had
been
an
undeniable
dash
and
daring
to
that
stranger
during
the
third
period
he
slept
when
he
awoke
late
in
the
morning
and
descended
from
a
cold
tub
to
a
breakfast
room
from
which
mclean
had
long
since
departed
he
brought
yet
another
mood
with
him
a
mood
of
dark
deep
disgust
and
a
shamed
inclination
to
dismiss
these
events
very
speedily
from
memory
for
that
shadowy
and
rather
shady
affair
he
had
abandoned
the
merry
and
delightful
jinny
jeffries
and
got
himself
involved
now
in
the
duty
of
explanations
and
peacemaking
what
in
the
world
was
he
going
to
say
he
meditated
a
note
but
he
hated
a
lie
on
paper
it
looked
so
thunderingly
black
and
white
besides
he
could
not
think
of
any
dear
jinny
awfully
sorry
i
was
called
away
no
that
would
do
he
could
take
refuge
in
no
such
vagueness
unfortunately
he
and
jinny
were
on
such
terms
of
old
intimacy
that
a
certain
explicitness
of
detail
was
expected
dear
jinny
i
had
to
leave
last
night
and
take
a
girl
home
no
she
would
ask
about
the
girl
jinny
had
a
propensity
for
locating
people
it
would
do
his
masculine
instinct
for
saying
the
least
possible
in
a
matter
with
a
woman
and
his
ripening
experience
which
taught
him
to
leave
no
mystery
to
awaken
suspicion
wrestled
with
the
affair
for
some
time
and
then
retired
from
the
field
he
compromised
by
telephoning
jinny
briefly
and
jinny
was
equally
as
brief
and
twice
as
cool
and
cryptic
and
promising
to
take
her
out
to
tea
he
reflected
that
if
he
took
her
to
tea
he
would
really
have
to
stay
over
another
night
for
it
would
be
too
late
to
regain
his
desert
camp
but
the
circumstances
seemed
to
call
for
some
social
amend
and
no
matter
how
many
nights
he
stayed
he
certainly
was
not
going
to
lurk
about
that
lane
outside
garden
doors
he
must
have
been
mad
stark
staring
mad
that
morning
during
its
remainder
he
concluded
his
buying
of
supplies
and
saw
to
their
shipment
upon
the
boat
that
left
upon
the
following
morning
that
noon
he
lunched
with
an
assistant
curator
of
the
cairo
museum
who
found
him
a
good
listener
that
afternoon
he
escorted
jinny
jeffries
and
her
uncle
and
aunt
the
josiah
pendletons
to
tea
upon
the
little
island
in
the
cairo
park
where
arabs
brought
them
tea
over
the
tiny
bridge
and
violins
played
behind
the
shrubbery
and
white
swans
glided
upon
the
blue
lake
and
then
he
carried
them
off
in
a
victoria
to
view
the
sunset
from
the
citadel
heights
not
a
word
about
the
dance
except
a
general
affirmative
to
pendleton
question
if
he
had
enjoyed
himself
the
pendletons
had
not
stayed
to
look
on
for
long
and
jinny
had
apparently
not
worn
her
bleeding
heart
upon
her
sleeve
but
this
immunity
could
not
last
he
could
not
hug
the
protecting
pendletons
to
him
forever
nor
did
he
want
to
they
waned
upon
him
conversation
was
a
perpetual
do
look
at
or
dissertations
from
the
guide
books
already
she
had
imparted
a
great
deal
of
flinders
petrie
to
him
about
his
tombs
pendleton
was
neither
enthusiastic
nor
voluble
but
he
was
attacking
the
objects
of
their
travels
in
the
same
spirit
that
he
had
attacked
and
surmounted
the
industrial
obstacles
of
his
career
and
he
went
to
a
great
deal
of
persistent
trouble
to
ascertain
the
exact
dates
of
passing
mosques
and
the
conformations
of
their
arches
the
travelers
had
already
done
the
citadel
they
had
climbed
its
rocky
hill
they
had
viewed
the
mahomet
ali
mosque
and
its
columns
and
its
carpets
and
had
taken
their
guide
and
their
word
that
it
was
an
inferior
structure
although
so
amazingly
effective
from
below
they
had
looked
studiously
down
upon
the
city
and
tried
to
distinguish
its
minarets
and
towers
and
ancient
gates
they
had
viewed
with
proper
quizzicalness
the
imprint
in
the
stone
parapet
of
the
hoof
of
that
blindfolded
horse
which
the
last
of
the
mamelukes
cornered
and
betrayed
had
spurred
from
the
heights
so
now
no
duty
upon
them
ryder
led
them
past
the
citadel
up
the
mokattam
hills
behind
it
to
that
hilltop
on
which
stood
the
little
ancient
mosque
of
the
where
the
sunset
spaces
flowed
round
them
like
a
sea
of
light
and
the
world
dropped
into
miniature
at
their
feet
below
them
in
a
golden
haze
cairo
domes
and
minarets
were
shining
like
a
city
of
dreams
to
the
north
toy
fields
vivid
green
of
rice
and
cotton
lands
and
the
silver
thread
of
the
winding
nile
and
all
beyond
west
and
southwest
the
vast
illimitable
stretch
of
desert
shimmering
in
the
opalescent
air
sweeping
on
to
the
farthest
edge
of
blue
horizon
a
nice
resting
place
said
jack
ryder
appreciatively
of
the
tomb
of
the
i
presume
the
date
is
given
pendleton
was
murmuring
as
he
began
to
ferret
with
his
baedecker
pendleton
sighed
sentimentally
he
must
have
been
very
fond
of
nature
he
was
very
distrustful
of
his
wives
said
ryder
grinning
he
had
three
of
them
all
young
and
beautiful
i
thought
you
said
he
was
a
saint
murmured
jinny
to
which
interpolation
he
responded
would
three
wives
make
any
man
a
saint
and
resumed
his
narrative
and
so
he
had
his
tomb
made
where
he
could
overlook
the
whole
city
and
observe
the
conduct
of
his
widows
they
could
move
objected
miss
jeffries
the
female
of
the
mohammedan
species
is
not
the
free
agent
that
you
imagine
ryder
retorted
beginning
with
a
smile
and
ending
with
a
queer
reminiscent
pang
he
had
a
moment
rather
complicated
twinge
of
amusement
at
her
reactions
if
she
should
know
that
to
an
encounter
with
a
female
of
the
mohammedan
species
was
to
be
attributed
his
departure
from
her
party
last
night
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
decided
yet
what
to
tell
her
and
the
time
was
undoubtedly
at
hand
the
time
at
hand
the
pendletons
were
too
americans
not
to
abdicate
before
the
young
they
did
not
saunter
away
and
make
any
opportunity
for
jack
and
jinny
as
sympathetic
european
chaperons
might
have
done
they
sat
upon
the
rocks
while
their
competent
young
people
betook
themselves
to
higher
heights
conscientiously
ryder
was
pointing
out
the
pyramid
fields
gizeh
abusir
sakkara
dahsur
and
now
here
if
you
look
the
medun
pyramid
that
tiny
sharp
prick
if
we
had
glasses
yes
but
why
did
you
like
the
ball
murmured
jinny
the
direct
i
did
like
the
ball
very
much
then
why
did
you
stay
i
i
was
feeling
he
murmured
lamely
wondering
why
girls
always
wanted
to
go
back
and
stir
up
dogs
that
had
gone
comfortably
to
sleep
did
it
come
on
suddenly
said
jinny
unsympathetically
her
eyes
still
upon
the
pyramids
something
whimsical
twitched
at
jack
ryder
lips
very
suddenly
like
thunder
out
of
china
crost
the
bay
i
suppose
that
dancing
with
the
same
girl
in
succession
brings
on
the
seizures
so
she
had
noticed
that
not
for
nothing
were
those
bright
gray
eyes
of
hers
not
for
nothing
the
red
hair
well
i
rather
think
it
did
he
said
deliberately
that
girl
was
a
child
who
had
danced
in
four
years
so
she
said
and
i
believe
her
and
jinny
received
what
he
intended
to
convey
stepped
on
your
buckled
shoon
and
you
felt
a
martyr
but
why
bolt
there
were
other
girls
who
danced
within
four
years
i
went
into
the
garden
he
murmured
the
fact
is
i
was
feeling
awfully
queer
he
brought
out
in
an
odd
tone
queer
was
a
good
word
for
it
he
let
it
go
at
that
he
could
do
better
jinny
looked
suddenly
uncertain
her
pique
was
streaked
with
compunction
she
had
been
horribly
angry
with
him
for
running
away
and
she
remembered
his
opposition
to
the
idea
enough
to
be
suspicious
of
any
disappearance
but
there
was
certainly
an
accent
of
embarrassed
sincerity
about
him
perhaps
he
been
ill
sudden
seizures
were
not
unknown
in
egypt
and
for
all
his
desert
brown
he
did
look
very
rugged
she
murmured
i
hope
you
had
taken
anything
that
disagreed
with
you
h
it
rather
agreed
with
me
at
the
time
said
jack
and
then
brought
himself
up
short
i
expect
i
have
looked
very
sharp
after
myself
but
jinny
did
not
wholly
renounce
her
idea
does
it
always
take
you
at
dances
you
do
want
to
go
to
that
unfair
i
came
you
know
you
came
and
went
i
have
been
all
right
if
i
had
come
he
murmured
and
jinny
felt
suddenly
ashamed
of
herself
do
you
suppose
that
you
would
stay
all
right
if
you
came
to
dinner
she
offered
pacificably
it
our
last
night
you
know
till
we
come
back
from
the
nile
i
wish
i
could
ryder
stopped
short
now
why
did
he
certainly
he
did
intend
but
his
tongue
took
matters
promptly
out
of
his
hesitation
hands
fact
is
i
an
engagement
he
added
appeasingly
that
why
i
was
so
keen
on
getting
you
for
tea
and
jinny
told
him
appreciatively
that
it
was
a
lovely
tea
and
a
lovely
view
we
going
to
be
at
the
hotel
i
expect
she
threw
out
carelessly
and
if
you
get
through
in
time
rather
hastily
he
assured
her
that
indeed
if
he
got
through
in
time
she
was
a
nice
girl
was
jinny
a
pretty
girl
with
just
the
right
amount
of
red
in
her
hair
sanity
would
have
sent
him
to
the
hotel
to
dine
with
her
sanity
would
also
have
sent
him
to
the
jockey
club
with
mclean
certainly
sanity
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
way
that
he
kept
himself
to
himself
after
his
farewells
at
the
hotel
with
the
pendletons
and
took
him
to
an
greek
café
where
he
dined
very
badly
upon
stringy
lamb
and
sodden
baklava
later
he
wandered
restlessly
about
dark
medieval
streets
where
squat
groups
were
clustered
about
some
coffee
house
door
intent
upon
a
game
of
checkers
or
some
patriarchal
story
teller
recounting
very
probably
a
bandied
narration
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
through
other
open
doors
drifted
the
exasperating
nasal
twang
of
cairene
music
and
idly
pausing
ryder
could
see
above
the
red
fezes
and
turbans
that
topped
the
audiences
the
dark
sleek
body
of
some
desert
dancing
girl
irresolutely
he
drifted
on
to
the
esbekeyih
quarters
to
the
streets
where
the
withdrawn
camels
and
donkeys
had
left
the
carriages
and
motors
of
that
stream
of
continental
night
life
which
sets
towards
cairo
in
the
season
russian
dukes
and
german
millionaires
viennese
actresses
and
french
singers
and
ladies
of
no
avowed
profession
gamblers
idlers
diplomats
drifters
vivid
flashes
of
color
in
the
bizarre
kaleidoscopic
spectacle
it
was
quite
dark
now
the
last
pale
gleam
of
the
afterglow
had
faded
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
deepening
and
darkening
was
pierced
with
the
thronging
stars
it
was
very
warm
no
breeze
but
a
fitful
stirring
in
the
tops
of
the
feathery
palms
the
streets
were
growing
still
only
from
some
of
the
hotels
came
the
sound
of
music
from
lighted
open
windows
jinny
would
be
rather
expectant
at
her
hotel
he
could
of
course
drop
in
for
a
few
minutes
since
he
was
so
near
he
walked
past
the
hotel
jinny
would
be
packing
or
ought
to
be
a
pity
to
disturb
her
and
his
dusty
tweeds
and
traveling
cap
was
no
calling
costume
he
walked
past
again
and
this
time
he
paused
on
the
brink
of
a
dark
canyon
of
a
lane
running
back
between
walls
hung
with
bougainvillea
quite
suddenly
he
remembered
that
he
had
told
that
girl
whose
name
he
did
not
know
that
he
would
come
it
was
a
definite
promise
it
was
an
obligation
he
could
do
nothing
less
it
might
be
unwelcome
absurd
a
nuisance
but
really
it
was
an
obligation
he
sauntered
down
the
lane
keeping
carefully
in
the
shadow
he
loitered
within
that
door
and
felt
a
queer
throb
of
emotion
at
the
sight
of
it
and
so
sauntering
and
loitering
he
waited
in
the
darkening
night
promising
himself
disgustedly
through
the
dragging
moments
to
clear
out
and
be
done
with
this
but
still
interminably
lingering
his
pulses
throbbing
with
that
disowned
expectancy
very
cautiously
the
gate
began
to
open
chapter
v
at
the
garden
gate
inch
by
inch
the
gate
edged
open
warily
he
presented
himself
the
furtive
crack
gave
him
an
instant
glimpse
of
a
dark
form
within
the
shadows
then
in
his
face
it
closed
ryder
waited
in
a
moment
it
was
opened
wider
and
he
saw
the
head
and
the
veiled
face
of
the
turkish
girl
and
out
from
the
blackness
the
sparkle
of
young
eyes
is
it
but
who
is
it
whispered
a
doubtful
voice
and
at
his
why
it
is
i
the
american
quickly
drawing
off
his
cap
a
little
hand
darted
out
of
the
darkness
to
pluck
him
swiftly
within
and
the
door
was
closed
to
within
an
inch
of
its
opening
then
the
black
phantom
drawing
him
back
among
the
shrubbery
against
the
wall
turned
with
a
muffled
note
of
laughter
but
the
costume
imagine
that
i
i
was
looking
again
for
a
scottish
chieftain
with
red
kilts
and
a
feather
in
his
cap
and
instead
ryder
glanced
down
at
his
tweeds
with
humorous
recognition
of
his
change
of
figure
then
his
eyes
returned
to
her
but
you
are
the
same
he
murmured
she
was
indeed
the
same
the
same
black
street
mantle
down
to
her
very
brows
the
same
black
veil
up
to
her
very
eyes
and
the
eyes
their
soft
mysterious
loveliness
the
little
winged
tilt
of
the
brows
apparently
their
effect
was
disconcertingly
the
same
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
was
far
from
a
normal
calm
so
you
were
all
right
he
half
whispered
those
steps
last
night
you
know
made
me
horribly
afraid
for
you
but
yes
i
am
all
right
as
excitement
gained
upon
him
a
constraint
was
falling
upon
her
they
were
both
remembering
that
moment
overlooked
in
the
rush
of
recognition
when
they
had
parted
in
this
place
when
he
had
had
the
temerity
to
clasp
and
kiss
her
aimée
was
standing
rigid
and
wary
ready
for
flight
at
the
first
fear
she
told
herself
that
she
had
only
come
through
pride
the
pride
that
insisted
upon
humbling
his
presumption
she
would
let
him
see
how
bitterly
he
had
offended
she
had
only
come
for
this
she
told
herself
and
to
see
if
he
had
come
if
he
had
come
that
would
have
dealt
a
sorrily
humiliating
blow
but
he
was
here
and
reassured
and
haughty
repeating
that
she
was
mortally
offended
her
spirit
alternating
between
pride
and
shame
and
a
delicious
fear
she
stood
there
in
the
shrubbery
fascinated
like
a
wild
shy
thing
of
another
age
that
was
old
miriam
she
explained
constrainedly
my
father
had
come
in
with
unexpectedness
lord
it
was
lucky
you
were
back
yes
it
was
lucky
she
assented
if
it
had
been
half
an
hour
before
she
broke
off
there
came
to
the
young
man
a
sobering
perception
of
the
risk
she
ran
of
the
supreme
folly
of
this
escapade
to
which
they
were
entrusting
themselves
it
was
a
realization
that
deserved
some
consideration
but
obstinately
with
young
carelessness
he
shook
it
off
after
all
this
was
comparatively
safe
for
her
she
was
not
out
of
bounds
at
an
alarm
he
could
slip
away
and
no
one
could
ever
know
what
risk
there
might
be
was
chiefly
his
own
when
you
asked
who
it
was
he
murmured
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
did
not
know
my
name
nor
i
yours
my
own
he
added
as
she
stood
unresponsive
is
ryder
jack
ryder
you
can
always
get
a
letter
to
me
at
the
agricultural
bank
that
is
the
quickest
way
my
friend
mclean
there
always
knows
where
my
diggings
are
when
in
cairo
i
stop
with
him
or
at
the
rossmore
house
i
shall
not
need
to
get
a
letter
to
you
monsieur
she
told
him
stiffly
but
if
you
did
how
would
you
sign
it
aimée
that
is
french
after
my
mother
aimée
that
means
beloved
does
it
she
was
silent
surely
she
thought
with
a
swelling
heart
if
he
were
sorry
he
would
tell
her
now
it
was
the
moment
for
contrition
for
appeasement
for
whatever
explanation
his
american
ways
might
have
she
had
thought
about
him
all
night
she
had
given
his
declaration
a
hundred
forms
but
always
it
had
been
a
declaration
now
she
waited
flagellating
her
sensitive
pride
ryder
was
conscious
of
the
constraint
tightening
about
them
and
in
the
dragging
pause
an
uncomfortable
common
sense
had
time
to
put
its
disconcerting
questions
what
did
it
matter
what
her
name
meant
what
in
the
world
was
he
doing
here
and
what
did
she
think
she
was
doing
here
not
that
he
wanted
her
to
go
and
suddenly
it
did
matter
whatever
they
thought
it
was
enough
that
they
were
together
in
that
still
soft
dark
he
was
breathing
quickly
his
pulses
were
beating
he
had
a
feeling
of
strange
heady
delight
the
crescent
moon
was
up
at
last
sailing
clear
of
the
house
tops
sending
its
bright
rays
through
the
filigree
of
tall
shrubs
a
finger
of
light
edged
the
contour
of
her
shrouded
head
he
bent
a
little
closer
wo
you
he
said
softly
take
off
your
veil
for
me
appalled
she
clasped
it
to
her
he
had
no
idea
in
the
world
of
the
shock
of
that
request
it
would
be
only
a
faint
parallel
of
its
impropriety
to
suggest
to
jinny
jeffries
that
she
discard
her
frock
even
ryder
acquaintance
with
egypt
could
not
tell
him
how
that
swift
confident
eagerness
of
his
could
startle
and
affront
i
want
to
see
you
so
very
much
he
was
murmuring
and
met
the
chill
disdain
of
her
retort
but
it
is
not
for
you
to
see
my
face
monsieur
who
is
to
see
it
he
demanded
who
but
the
man
i
am
to
marry
she
gave
distinctly
back
the
word
hit
him
like
stone
he
was
conscious
of
a
shock
did
she
intend
to
rebuke
or
to
imply
to
question
his
intention
the
steadiness
of
her
low
voice
suggested
a
certain
steadiness
of
design
he
had
heard
of
girls
who
knew
their
own
minds
girls
with
unexpectedly
vision
perhaps
poor
child
she
looked
upon
him
as
romantic
escape
from
all
that
was
restrictive
in
her
life
secluded
women
go
fast
when
they
start
the
devil
take
him
for
that
kiss
a
somewhat
set
look
upon
his
thin
face
guarded
the
fluctuations
of
his
soul
but
the
blood
rose
strongly
under
his
dark
skin
for
a
moment
he
did
not
venture
upon
a
reply
and
in
that
moment
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
she
had
caught
his
meaning
from
him
and
that
it
was
a
horrible
mistake
it
was
one
of
those
instants
of
exchanges
of
meanings
whose
revelation
was
as
useless
to
be
denied
as
powerless
to
be
explained
then
her
words
came
in
tumultuous
passionate
refutation
of
his
thought
that
is
what
my
father
had
come
to
tell
me
that
he
had
arranged
my
marriage
it
is
a
very
splendid
thing
to
a
general
a
rich
general
she
had
not
meant
to
tell
him
like
that
but
for
the
moment
she
was
savagely
glad
to
hurl
it
at
him
he
made
no
answer
his
eyes
were
inscrutably
intent
a
variety
of
things
were
rearranging
themselves
in
his
head
you
you
going
to
marry
him
he
said
slowly
what
else
but
she
felt
the
phrase
unfortunate
and
plunged
past
it
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
no
monsieur
it
is
for
my
father
to
arrange
but
his
indulgence
you
were
telling
me
you
know
that
he
was
so
fond
of
you
and
that
you
were
one
of
the
moderns
the
revolting
moderns
jack
ryder
tone
was
questioningly
cynical
and
its
raillery
cut
through
her
brief
sham
of
pride
so
i
thought
too
last
night
a
tinge
of
infinite
disillusionment
was
in
her
young
voice
but
it
is
not
so
then
you
accept
the
shrouded
head
nodded
but
you
ca
want
to
he
broke
out
with
sudden
heat
you
know
him
at
all
do
you
this
general
know
him
i
have
never
seen
his
face
nor
heard
his
voice
and
i
would
die
first
she
added
with
bitter
helpless
fierceness
under
her
breath
the
veil
muffled
that
from
him
but
why
why
he
repeated
in
an
angrily
puzzled
way
she
made
a
little
gesture
of
weary
impotence
out
of
the
dark
draperies
her
hands
were
like
white
fluttering
butterflies
what
can
i
do
i
should
think
you
could
do
the
old
harry
of
a
lot
weep
said
the
girl
with
a
pale
irony
not
lost
upon
him
weep
or
row
or
run
he
added
almost
reluctantly
she
turned
away
her
head
i
know
i
thought
once
that
i
could
run
for
that
i
stole
the
key
to
this
gate
but
where
would
i
run
monsieur
i
have
neither
friends
nor
nor
the
resources
there
have
been
girls
two
sisters
who
ran
away
last
year
but
they
were
already
married
and
they
had
cousins
in
france
for
me
my
cousins
do
not
exist
i
do
not
know
my
mother
family
they
disowned
her
for
her
marriage
my
father
says
and
so
but
it
is
not
possible
to
evade
this
it
is
not
possible
this
marriage
is
required
required
rot
ca
you
do
you
he
paused
looking
down
upon
her
in
tremendous
and
serious
uncertainty
the
impulse
was
strong
upon
him
to
tell
her
that
he
would
help
her
the
accents
of
her
voice
had
seemed
to
tear
at
his
very
heart
it
was
utter
madness
where
in
the
map
of
africa
would
he
hide
her
and
how
would
he
take
care
of
her
what
would
he
do
to
her
make
love
to
her
marry
her
take
home
a
wife
from
an
egyptian
harem
a
surprising
acquisition
with
which
to
startle
and
enchant
his
decorous
family
in
east
middleton
and
a
pretty
end
to
his
work
here
his
reputation
his
responsibilities
it
was
madness
and
the
fact
that
the
thought
had
presented
itself
even
for
his
flouting
mockery
indicated
that
he
was
mad
he
told
himself
to
be
careful
better
men
than
he
had
everlastingly
done
for
themselves
because
upon
a
night
of
stars
and
moonshine
some
girl
had
played
the
very
devil
with
their
common
sense
he
reminded
himself
that
he
had
never
set
eyes
on
her
until
last
night
that
she
might
be
the
consummate
perfection
of
a
minx
that
there
might
not
be
a
word
of
truth
in
all
of
this
this
general
now
sudden
not
a
word
about
it
last
night
and
now
he
had
an
inkling
that
even
mohammedan
fathers
do
not
rush
matters
at
such
a
pace
for
all
he
knew
the
girl
might
be
inventing
this
general
for
some
artless
reasons
of
her
own
for
all
he
knew
she
might
be
married
to
him
and
desirous
of
escape
but
he
did
believe
it
she
was
too
young
and
shy
and
virginal
the
accents
of
her
candor
rebuked
his
skepticism
he
merely
told
himself
these
things
because
the
last
vestige
of
his
expiring
common
sense
was
prompting
him
and
after
all
these
creditable
and
excellent
exhortations
to
the
utter
extinction
of
the
last
vestige
of
that
common
sense
he
heard
himself
saying
abruptly
but
is
there
anything
in
the
world
that
i
can
do
nothing
monsieur
but
for
you
to
submit
like
this
it
is
not
to
be
helped
but
it
to
be
helped
if
you
really
dislike
it
he
added
jealously
i
can
not
help
it
because
because
my
father
she
hesitated
the
honor
of
her
father
and
her
family
pride
and
affection
were
all
involved
yet
suddenly
the
sacrifice
of
these
became
more
tolerable
than
to
consent
to
that
image
of
herself
which
she
saw
swiftly
defining
itself
in
his
mind
that
slight
weak
creature
whose
acquiescent
passivity
submitted
to
this
marriage
the
thought
was
unbearable
she
was
burning
beneath
her
veil
she
would
tell
him
and
perhaps
she
was
not
averse
in
her
childish
pride
to
the
pitiful
glory
of
having
him
see
her
in
the
beauty
of
her
filial
sacrifice
my
father
has
has
done
something
against
the
english
laws
she
faltered
and
hamdi
bey
this
general
knows
of
it
and
will
inform
unless
unless
my
father
makes
this
marriage
a
cousin
of
his
has
seen
me
she
added
her
young
vanity
forlornly
rearing
its
head
and
told
hamdi
that
i
am
not
not
too
a
girl
her
essay
of
a
laugh
died
ryder
look
deepened
its
sharp
defensive
concentration
this
is
true
i
mean
your
father
is
not
just
putting
something
over
telling
you
to
get
your
consent
her
thoughts
flew
back
to
her
father
haggard
face
oh
it
is
true
i
know
and
he
going
to
hand
you
over
what
sort
is
this
hamdi
a
general
old
evil
enough
to
lay
traps
to
obtain
me
it
abomination
the
anger
in
the
young
man
surged
beyond
his
control
you
must
not
do
it
if
your
father
is
clever
enough
to
break
a
law
let
him
be
clever
enough
to
mend
it
by
himself
such
a
sacrifice
is
not
required
you
must
realize
what
this
means
to
you
you
must
realize
look
here
i
help
you
i
plan
some
escape
there
must
be
ways
i
have
friends
she
stifled
the
leap
of
her
heart
she
held
her
head
high
and
made
what
she
thought
was
a
very
noble
little
speech
it
is
for
my
father
monsieur
you
do
not
understand
it
is
to
save
my
father
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
he
was
afraid
to
answer
for
a
moment
he
could
feel
the
unruly
blood
beating
even
in
the
lips
he
pressed
together
but
do
you
understand
he
blurted
at
last
and
broke
off
after
all
he
did
not
know
this
girl
if
he
swayed
her
judgment
now
and
dragged
her
away
what
life
what
compensation
could
he
offer
her
how
did
he
know
that
she
would
not
regret
it
would
she
be
happier
in
a
world
unknown
she
had
been
brought
up
to
this
sort
of
thing
it
was
bred
in
her
marriage
was
her
inevitable
game
this
very
charm
she
exercised
this
subtle
haunting
invasion
of
his
senses
what
was
that
but
another
proof
of
the
harem
existence
where
all
influences
were
forced
to
serve
the
ends
of
sex
and
she
was
so
maddeningly
resigned
to
taking
this
general
a
queer
hot
rage
was
gaining
possession
of
him
oh
well
if
you
prefer
this
he
said
brutally
with
a
youthful
desire
to
wreak
pain
in
return
for
that
strange
pain
which
something
was
inflicting
upon
him
a
girl
who
would
let
him
kiss
her
one
night
and
on
the
next
inform
him
that
she
was
giving
herself
to
an
unknown
an
old
turk
if
she
could
go
like
that
to
some
other
arms
and
lips
he
wanted
to
take
her
fiercely
in
his
arms
and
crush
her
lips
against
his
and
then
fling
her
away
and
say
oh
go
to
him
now
if
you
can
and
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
to
gather
her
to
him
as
tenderly
as
if
she
were
a
flower
he
was
guarding
and
tell
her
that
he
would
protect
her
against
all
the
world
he
was
divided
and
confused
and
blindly
angry
he
felt
baffled
and
frustrated
he
was
both
aching
and
raging
and
yet
he
was
capable
of
reminding
himself
in
some
corner
of
his
uninvaded
mind
that
this
was
undoubtedly
the
best
thing
for
them
both
what
else
for
him
for
her
and
yet
his
tongue
went
on
stabbing
her
if
this
is
what
you
are
determined
to
do
he
heard
himself
saying
hardly
yet
with
a
hint
of
deferred
finality
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
if
this
then
is
what
you
are
like
if
you
are
the
soft
submissive
harem
creature
the
toy
the
odalisque
if
you
will
endure
undesired
love
rather
than
face
the
world
and
she
knew
that
was
what
he
was
saying
to
her
the
injustice
brought
a
lump
of
to
her
throbbing
throat
that
he
should
not
realize
and
honor
the
courage
of
her
sacrifice
that
he
should
reproach
despise
she
had
expected
other
entreaties
protestations
her
heart
ached
with
a
throb
of
steady
dreariness
but
she
did
not
stir
not
a
line
of
her
drooping
draperies
wavered
towards
him
and
swallowing
that
lump
in
her
throat
she
achieved
a
toneless
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
a
sound
came
from
the
house
ryder
seemed
to
rouse
himself
then
he
said
uncertainly
monsieur
he
looked
oddly
at
her
he
muttered
again
and
turned
and
stumbled
out
of
the
gate
a
pool
of
moonlight
lay
without
its
arches
and
he
stepped
into
it
as
if
coming
out
of
the
shadows
of
an
enchanted
garden
he
stood
and
straightened
himself
as
if
throwing
off
that
garden
spell
he
put
back
his
shoulders
and
took
a
quick
step
down
the
lane
a
slight
sound
drew
his
eyes
back
she
had
followed
him
to
the
gate
she
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
against
the
inky
wells
of
shadow
into
which
her
black
robe
flowed
and
in
the
moonlight
her
face
gazing
after
him
was
an
exquisite
ethereal
apparition
like
a
spirit
of
the
garden
she
had
cast
off
her
veil
he
had
a
vision
of
her
dark
eyes
shining
over
cheeks
of
lips
in
curves
of
haunting
sweetness
of
the
tender
contour
of
her
young
face
fixed
unforgettingly
in
the
radiant
moonlight
only
an
instant
vision
for
while
the
blood
stopped
in
his
veins
the
darkness
engulfed
her
like
a
magician
curtain
but
he
waited
while
he
heard
the
gate
closed
still
he
waited
while
he
heard
her
locking
it
and
then
for
all
his
hot
young
pride
he
turned
back
and
knocked
upon
it
he
called
softly
he
whispered
entreaties
not
a
sound
not
an
answer
in
a
revulsion
of
feeling
he
turned
and
made
his
way
blindly
from
the
lane
she
had
heard
his
voice
like
a
creature
utterly
spent
she
had
been
leaning
against
the
great
gate
from
which
she
had
withdrawn
the
key
but
she
uttered
not
a
breath
in
answer
and
after
she
had
heard
his
footsteps
die
away
she
turned
slowly
back
and
groped
among
the
rose
roots
for
the
key
hiding
place
mechanically
she
smoothed
it
over
and
moved
on
towards
the
house
all
was
quiet
there
that
sound
had
been
no
alarm
unobserved
she
slipped
within
the
little
door
and
up
the
spiral
steps
she
had
not
seen
the
dark
eyes
that
were
watching
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
rose
thicket
after
the
girl
had
gained
the
house
the
old
woman
came
forward
and
stooped
before
the
marked
bush
muttering
under
her
breath
at
the
thorns
after
a
few
moments
she
gave
a
little
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
her
exploring
hand
drew
out
the
key
smoothing
again
the
rifled
hiding
place
among
the
roses
she
made
her
careful
way
into
the
house
chapter
vi
a
secret
of
the
sands
the
siesta
was
past
the
sun
was
tilting
towards
the
west
and
shadows
were
beginning
to
jut
out
across
the
blazing
sands
over
the
mounds
of
rubbish
the
bearers
had
resumed
their
slow
procession
a
picturesque
frieze
of
tattered
ebony
figures
baskets
on
heads
against
a
cloudless
cobalt
sky
and
again
the
hot
air
was
invaded
with
the
monotonous
rise
and
fall
of
their
labor
chant
a
man
with
a
short
pointed
red
beard
and
an
academic
face
beneath
a
pith
helmet
was
stooping
over
the
siftings
from
those
baskets
intent
upon
the
stream
of
sand
through
the
wire
screens
patiently
he
discarded
the
unending
pebbles
discovering
at
rare
intervals
some
lost
bead
some
splinter
of
old
sycamore
wood
some
fragment
of
pottery
in
which
a
ptolemy
had
sipped
his
wine
or
a
kitchen
wench
had
soaked
her
lentils
beyond
the
man
were
traces
of
the
native
camp
a
fire
a
roll
of
rags
a
tattered
shelter
cloth
stuck
on
two
tottering
sticks
and
distributed
indiscriminatingly
were
a
tethered
goat
a
white
donkey
with
motionless
drooping
ears
and
a
few
supercilious
camels
the
camp
was
in
the
center
of
a
broken
line
of
foothills
on
the
desert
edge
north
and
south
and
west
the
wide
sands
swept
out
to
meet
the
sky
and
to
the
east
shutting
out
the
nile
valley
the
hills
reared
their
red
rock
from
the
yellow
drift
among
the
jutting
rock
in
the
foreground
yawned
dark
mouths
that
were
the
entrances
of
the
discovered
tombs
and
within
one
of
these
tombs
was
another
white
man
he
was
conducting
his
own
siftings
in
high
solitude
a
lean
bronzed
young
man
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
at
the
present
moment
an
unexhilarated
expression
it
had
been
two
weeks
since
jack
ryder
had
returned
to
camp
two
interminable
weeks
they
were
the
longest
the
dullest
the
dreariest
the
most
irritatingly
undelighting
weeks
that
he
had
ever
lived
through
but
bitterly
he
resented
any
aspersion
from
the
thatcher
upon
his
disposition
he
wanted
it
distinctly
understood
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
a
man
was
in
the
dumps
just
because
he
was
well
garrulous
just
because
he
did
go
about
whistling
like
a
steam
siren
or
exult
like
a
cheer
leader
when
some
one
dug
up
the
effigy
of
a
just
because
he
objected
when
the
natives
twanged
their
fool
strings
all
night
and
wailed
at
the
moon
the
moon
was
full
now
round
and
white
it
went
sailing
blandly
over
the
eternal
monotony
of
desert
round
and
white
it
lighted
up
the
eternal
sameness
of
life
he
had
never
noticed
it
before
but
a
moon
was
a
poignantly
depressing
phenomenon
he
could
help
it
a
man
could
make
himself
be
a
comedian
it
was
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
grump
he
would
have
been
glad
to
be
glad
he
wanted
thatcher
to
make
him
glad
he
defied
him
to
he
did
enjoy
this
flat
insipid
taste
of
things
this
dull
grind
this
feeling
of
sameness
and
dullness
that
made
nothing
seem
worth
while
a
feeling
that
he
had
been
marooned
on
a
desert
island
far
from
all
stir
and
throb
of
life
suppose
he
did
dig
up
a
suppose
he
dug
up
hathor
herself
or
cleopatra
or
ten
little
ptolemies
what
was
the
good
of
it
not
jinny
jeffries
herself
could
have
cast
more
aspersions
upon
the
personal
value
of
excavations
when
he
was
tired
of
denying
to
himself
that
there
was
anything
unusual
the
matter
with
him
he
shifted
the
inner
argument
and
took
up
the
denial
that
anything
which
had
happened
in
cairo
those
two
weeks
before
had
anything
to
do
with
it
as
if
that
rash
encounter
as
if
he
were
the
silly
senseless
sentimental
sort
of
idiot
to
go
mooning
about
his
work
because
of
a
girl
and
a
girl
from
a
harem
with
a
taste
for
secret
masquerades
and
turkish
marriages
as
if
he
cared
of
course
he
admitted
this
logically
and
coldly
now
to
himself
as
he
sat
there
in
the
ray
of
his
excavator
lantern
on
the
sanded
floor
at
the
end
of
the
hall
of
offerings
of
course
he
was
sorry
for
the
girl
it
was
no
life
for
any
young
girl
especially
a
spirited
one
with
her
veins
bubbling
with
french
blood
the
system
was
wrong
if
they
were
going
to
shut
up
those
girls
they
had
no
business
to
bring
them
up
on
modern
ideas
if
they
kept
the
mashrubiyeh
on
the
windows
and
the
yashmak
on
their
faces
they
ought
to
keep
the
kohl
on
their
eyes
and
the
henna
on
their
fingers
and
education
out
of
their
hidden
heads
it
was
too
bad
but
of
course
they
were
brought
up
to
it
look
how
quickly
that
girl
had
given
in
she
was
turkish
through
and
through
submissive
docile
and
a
darned
good
thing
she
was
too
suppose
she
had
taken
him
at
his
fool
word
suppose
she
had
really
wanted
to
get
away
lucky
that
what
he
been
and
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
never
again
no
more
masked
young
things
with
their
stolen
keys
and
their
harem
entrances
no
more
whispered
tales
of
woe
in
a
shady
garden
no
more
violently
he
wrenched
himself
from
his
no
mores
recollection
had
a
way
of
stirring
an
unpleasant
tumult
but
it
was
all
over
he
had
forgotten
it
he
forget
it
he
would
forget
work
that
was
the
thing
normal
sensible
every
day
work
but
there
was
no
joy
in
this
tonic
work
somewhere
between
a
night
and
a
morning
he
had
lost
that
glow
of
accomplishment
which
had
buoyed
him
which
had
made
him
fairly
ecstatic
over
the
discovery
of
this
very
tomb
for
this
tomb
was
his
own
find
it
had
been
found
long
before
by
the
plundering
persians
and
it
had
been
found
by
arabs
who
had
plundered
the
persian
remains
but
between
and
after
those
findings
the
oblivious
sands
had
swept
over
it
blotting
it
from
the
world
choking
the
entrance
hall
and
the
shafts
seeping
through
entrances
and
packing
its
dry
drift
over
the
rifled
sarcophagus
of
the
king
and
over
the
withered
mummy
of
the
young
girl
in
the
the
tombs
had
been
cleared
now
down
almost
to
the
stone
floors
and
ryder
was
busy
with
the
drifts
that
had
lodged
in
the
crevices
about
the
entrance
to
the
shaft
it
was
really
an
important
find
although
much
plundered
the
walls
were
intact
and
the
delicate
carvings
in
the
white
limestone
walls
were
exceptional
examples
and
there
were
some
very
interesting
things
to
decipher
a
scholar
and
an
explorer
could
well
be
enthusiastic
but
ryder
continued
to
look
far
from
enthusiastic
even
when
his
groping
fingers
searching
a
cranny
came
in
contact
with
a
hard
substance
his
face
did
not
change
to
any
lightning
radiance
unexpectantly
he
picked
up
the
lump
and
brushed
it
off
a
gleam
of
gold
shone
in
his
hand
but
it
was
no
ancient
amulet
or
necklace
or
breast
guard
nor
was
it
any
bit
of
the
harness
of
the
plundering
persians
it
was
a
locket
very
heavily
and
ornately
carved
he
stood
a
moment
staring
down
at
the
thing
with
a
curious
feeling
of
having
stood
staring
down
at
exactly
the
same
thing
before
that
subconscious
feeling
of
the
repetition
of
events
which
supports
the
theories
of
reincarnationists
and
then
quite
suddenly
memory
came
to
his
aid
in
mclean
office
that
day
of
the
masquerade
those
visiting
frenchmen
and
that
locket
they
had
shown
him
of
course
the
thing
reminded
him
and
it
was
remarkably
alike
the
same
thick
oval
the
same
ponderous
effect
of
the
coat
of
arms
if
it
should
prove
the
same
coat
of
arms
that
would
be
a
clue
with
his
mind
still
piecing
the
recollection
and
surmise
together
his
fingers
pressed
the
spring
there
was
a
miniature
within
but
it
was
not
the
picture
of
monsieur
delcassé
ryder
was
looking
down
upon
the
face
of
a
girl
a
beautiful
spirited
face
with
merry
eyes
and
wistful
lips
dark
eyes
with
a
lovely
arch
of
brow
and
lips
with
haunting
curves
and
eyes
and
brows
and
lips
and
curves
it
was
the
face
of
the
girl
who
had
gazed
after
him
in
the
moonlight
against
the
shadows
of
the
pasha
garden
chapter
vii
to
mclean
astonishment
it
is
no
end
of
good
of
you
jack
to
take
this
trouble
andrew
mclean
remarked
appreciatively
looking
up
from
his
scrutiny
of
the
packet
which
his
unexpected
luncheon
guest
had
pushed
over
to
his
plate
uncommon
thoughtful
it
undoubtedly
a
twin
to
that
locket
the
portrait
of
the
man
wife
whatever
his
name
was
delcassé
said
jack
ryder
promptly
gratefully
he
drained
the
second
lemon
squash
which
the
mohammed
had
placed
at
his
elbow
it
had
been
a
hard
morning
trip
this
coming
in
from
camp
in
high
haste
and
he
was
hot
and
dusty
you
might
have
sent
the
thing
mclean
mentioned
i
daresay
that
special
agent
chap
has
left
the
country
for
i
recollect
he
said
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
search
and
of
course
this
is
much
of
a
clue
eh
what
it
everything
of
a
clue
insisted
ryder
it
shows
where
this
frenchman
was
working
for
the
first
thing
unless
it
had
been
stolen
by
some
native
who
lost
it
in
that
tomb
natives
do
lose
gold
lockets
of
course
it
might
have
been
stolen
and
hidden
but
that
it
much
more
likely
that
this
was
the
very
tomb
where
delcassé
was
working
at
the
time
of
his
death
for
one
thing
the
place
showed
signs
of
previous
excavation
up
to
the
inner
corridor
and
there
i
swear
no
modern
got
ahead
of
me
and
for
another
thing
it
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
limestone
carving
of
the
tomb
of
thi
which
delcassé
wrote
his
book
about
looks
very
much
as
if
it
might
be
by
the
same
artist
there
a
flock
of
hippopotami
in
a
marsh
scene
with
the
identical
drawing
and
there
the
same
lovely
boat
in
full
sail
but
there
you
bounder
you
do
know
the
tomb
of
thi
from
a
thyroid
gland
you
here
to
administer
financial
justice
the
middle
the
high
and
the
low
your
soul
is
with
piasters
not
the
past
but
take
my
word
for
it
it
exactly
the
spot
where
an
enthusiast
of
the
thi
tomb
would
be
grubbing
away
lord
they
could
choose
their
find
in
those
days
it
uncommonly
likely
mclean
conceded
abandoning
his
demolished
cherry
tart
and
pulling
out
his
briar
and
if
the
locket
proves
the
duplicate
of
the
other
it
indicates
that
it
a
portrait
of
madame
delcassé
but
it
does
indicate
what
has
become
of
madame
delcassé
though
in
a
general
way
mclean
deduced
with
scotch
judicialness
it
supports
the
theory
of
foul
play
the
woman
would
hardly
have
lost
her
miniature
or
have
sold
it
except
under
pressing
conditions
in
fact
ryder
was
brusque
with
his
facts
that
does
matter
madame
delcassé
does
matter
the
thing
that
matters
is
as
brusquely
he
broke
off
his
tongue
balked
before
the
revelation
but
he
goaded
it
on
that
there
is
a
girl
the
living
image
of
that
picture
i
say
mclean
looked
up
at
that
distinctly
intrigued
getting
on
you
mean
you
seen
her
ryder
nodded
suddenly
busy
with
his
cigarette
where
is
she
now
in
cairo
that
luck
man
and
you
say
like
you
think
it
her
picture
it
an
uncommon
face
mclean
bent
over
it
again
i
fancied
the
artist
had
just
been
making
a
bit
of
beauty
but
if
there
a
girl
like
that
fancy
stumbling
on
that
but
where
is
she
and
what
name
does
she
go
by
oh
her
name
she
does
know
her
own
of
course
ryder
paused
uncertainly
she
in
cairo
he
began
again
vaguely
she
be
just
about
the
right
age
eighteen
or
so
she
she
had
hard
luck
distressfully
he
hesitated
the
shrewd
eyes
of
mclean
dwelt
upon
him
in
sorrowful
silence
eh
jock
he
said
at
last
with
mock
scandal
scarcely
veiling
rebuke
i
did
not
know
that
you
knew
any
of
that
sort
the
poor
wee
lost
thing
tell
me
now
tell
you
you
off
your
chump
said
jack
rudely
she
no
lost
lamb
fact
is
she
never
spoken
to
a
man
except
myself
he
rather
enjoyed
the
start
this
gave
mclean
after
his
insinuations
it
helped
him
on
with
his
story
the
girl
does
know
her
own
name
at
all
i
gather
she
thinks
she
the
daughter
of
tewfick
pasha
her
mother
married
the
turk
and
died
very
soon
afterwards
and
he
brought
up
this
girl
as
his
own
she
says
she
his
only
child
he
paused
ostensibly
to
blow
an
elaborate
smoke
ring
but
actually
to
enjoy
mclean
astonishment
as
astonishment
it
was
distinctly
vivid
it
verged
upon
a
genuine
horror
as
ryder
meaning
sank
into
his
friend
mind
mclean
knew
slightly
tewfick
pasha
he
knew
supremely
the
inviolable
seclusion
of
a
daughter
of
such
a
household
he
knew
the
utter
impossibility
of
any
man
speech
with
her
yet
here
was
ryder
telling
him
ryder
telling
him
was
a
sketchy
performance
he
mentioned
the
girl
appearance
at
the
masquerade
and
their
acquaintance
he
touched
lightly
upon
her
attempted
flight
and
his
pursuit
even
more
lightly
he
passed
over
those
lingering
moments
at
her
garden
gate
and
the
exchange
of
confidences
she
said
that
her
dead
mother
had
been
french
and
that
her
name
was
her
mother
aimée
so
there
is
but
the
likeness
man
her
face
she
never
unveiled
to
you
well
the
next
night
the
night
it
was
at
this
point
that
ryder
began
to
lose
his
relish
of
astonishment
yes
the
next
night
he
repeated
with
careful
carelessness
i
told
the
girl
i
would
come
and
see
if
she
got
in
all
right
there
had
been
some
footsteps
the
night
before
and
you
went
and
she
came
do
you
suppose
she
sent
her
father
you
lucky
she
did
send
her
father
eunuch
mclean
retorted
grimly
well
get
on
with
your
damning
story
the
girl
took
off
her
veil
nothing
of
the
kind
said
jack
a
trifle
testily
so
soon
does
conventional
masculinity
champion
the
conservatism
of
the
other
sex
that
was
just
as
i
was
going
gone
in
fact
i
looked
back
and
she
had
drawn
her
veil
aside
the
moon
was
bright
on
her
face
i
saw
her
as
clear
as
daylight
and
i
tell
you
that
this
miniature
is
a
picture
of
her
she
is
delcassé
daughter
and
she
does
know
it
her
mother
was
stolen
by
that
disgusting
old
turk
hold
on
a
bit
fifteen
years
ago
tewfick
could
hardly
have
been
thirty
and
he
has
the
rep
of
a
don
juan
it
may
have
been
a
love
affair
or
it
may
have
been
plunder
the
girl
remembers
her
very
little
she
was
so
young
when
her
mother
died
she
said
that
the
father
was
so
in
love
that
he
never
married
again
h
it
seems
to
me
that
i
heard
tales
of
our
tewfick
and
of
pretty
ladies
in
apartments
cairo
is
a
city
of
secrets
and
tattlers
however
as
to
this
delcassé
inheritance
i
just
notify
the
french
legation
we
have
to
look
sharp
said
ryder
quickly
there
no
time
to
lose
the
girl
is
to
be
married
married
but
she
inherit
the
money
just
the
same
but
she
does
want
to
be
married
ryder
insisted
anxiously
her
father
her
alleged
father
has
just
sprung
this
on
her
says
there
are
political
or
financial
reasons
he
been
caught
in
some
dirty
work
by
this
hamdi
bey
and
he
stopping
hamdi
mouth
with
the
girl
and
we
got
to
stop
that
i
wonder
if
we
can
said
mclean
thoughtfully
if
we
can
when
the
girl
is
french
when
she
been
lied
to
and
deceived
she
seems
to
have
been
taken
jolly
well
care
of
brought
up
as
his
own
and
all
that
keep
your
shirt
on
jack
mclean
advised
dryly
with
a
shrewd
glance
from
his
gray
eyes
at
the
other
unguarded
heat
then
his
eyes
dropped
to
the
miniature
again
a
lovely
face
a
lovely
unfortunate
creature
and
if
the
daughter
looked
like
that
small
wonder
that
jack
was
touched
beauty
in
distress
some
men
had
all
the
luck
mclean
reflected
he
had
never
taken
jack
for
the
gallivanting
kind
either
yet
here
he
was
going
to
masquerades
with
one
girl
and
coming
home
with
another
jack
was
too
good
looking
that
was
the
trouble
with
the
youngster
good
looking
and
gay
humored
the
kind
that
attracted
women
women
and
romance
were
never
fluttering
about
lank
uninteresting
old
scotchmen
of
a
mild
and
wistful
pang
which
mclean
refused
to
name
made
itself
known
i
see
the
legation
he
began
at
once
i
wait
urged
ryder
and
at
once
mclean
went
the
result
was
what
he
had
foreseen
the
legation
was
appreciative
of
his
interest
that
special
agent
had
returned
to
france
but
his
address
was
left
and
undoubtedly
the
family
of
delcassé
would
be
grateful
for
any
information
which
monsieur
mclean
could
send
send
repudiated
ryder
hotly
write
to
france
and
back
wait
for
somebody
to
come
over
ca
the
legation
do
something
now
the
legation
has
no
authority
they
ca
take
the
girl
away
from
the
man
who
is
at
any
rate
her
they
can
put
the
fear
of
god
into
him
about
this
marriage
they
can
deny
his
right
to
hand
her
over
to
one
of
his
pals
they
can
threaten
him
with
an
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
of
her
marriage
and
why
should
they
they
may
regard
it
as
a
very
natural
marriage
and
remember
my
dear
jack
that
the
legation
has
no
desire
to
alienate
the
affections
of
influential
turks
or
criticize
romances
you
have
a
totally
wrong
impression
of
the
responsibilities
of
foreign
representatives
but
to
let
him
dispose
of
a
french
girl
he
is
disposing
of
her
as
his
daughter
in
honorable
marriage
to
a
wealthy
and
aristocratic
general
there
can
be
no
question
of
his
motives
of
course
if
you
think
that
sort
of
thing
is
all
right
carefully
mclean
ignored
the
other
wrath
patiently
he
explained
it
not
what
i
think
my
dear
fellow
what
the
legation
thinks
there
not
a
chance
in
the
world
of
getting
the
marriage
stopped
then
i
do
it
myself
declared
ryder
i
see
this
tewfick
pasha
and
talk
to
him
tell
him
the
money
is
to
come
to
the
girl
only
when
she
is
single
tell
him
the
french
law
gives
the
representatives
full
charge
tell
him
that
he
kidnapped
the
mother
and
the
government
will
prosecute
unless
the
girl
is
given
her
liberty
tell
him
anything
a
man
with
a
guilty
conscience
can
always
be
bluffed
in
silence
mclean
gazed
upon
him
perplexed
and
clouded
his
quizzical
twinkle
gone
jack
was
taking
this
thing
infernally
to
heart
and
it
was
a
bad
business
you
will
let
me
do
the
telling
he
stated
at
last
grimly
what
can
be
said
i
say
like
a
fool
i
will
meddle
and
so
it
happened
that
within
another
hour
two
very
stiff
and
constrained
young
men
were
ringing
the
bell
at
the
entrance
door
of
tewfick
pasha
chapter
viii
tewfick
receives
a
huge
soudanese
admitted
them
they
found
themselves
in
a
tiled
vestibule
looking
through
open
arches
into
the
green
of
a
garden
that
garden
ryder
hardly
needed
to
remind
himself
with
whose
back
door
he
had
made
such
unconventional
acquaintance
now
he
had
a
glimpse
of
a
sunny
fountain
and
fluttering
pigeons
and
on
either
side
of
the
garden
of
the
two
wings
of
the
building
gay
white
walls
with
green
shutters
more
suggestive
of
a
french
villa
than
an
egyptian
palace
before
the
soudanese
marshaled
them
toward
the
stairs
upon
the
right
the
left
then
was
the
way
to
the
haremlik
and
somewhere
in
those
secluded
rooms
to
which
no
man
but
the
owner
of
the
palace
ever
gained
admission
was
aimée
the
soudanese
mounted
the
stairs
before
them
and
held
open
a
door
into
a
long
from
which
the
pasha
modernity
had
stripped
every
charm
except
the
color
of
some
worn
old
rugs
the
windows
were
draped
in
european
style
the
walls
exhibited
paper
instead
of
paneling
in
one
corner
was
a
victrola
and
in
another
beside
a
lounge
chair
stood
a
table
littered
with
cigarette
trays
and
french
novels
with
explicit
titles
the
only
egyptian
touch
to
the
place
was
four
enormous
oil
portraits
of
pompous
turbaned
gentlemen
in
one
of
whom
ryder
recognized
the
familiar
rotundity
of
mahomet
ali
in
his
grand
robes
as
a
pasha
palace
it
was
a
blow
and
ryder
vague
romantic
notions
of
high
halls
and
gilded
arches
suffered
a
collapse
tewfick
pasha
came
in
with
haste
he
had
been
going
out
when
these
callers
were
announced
and
he
was
dressed
for
parade
in
a
very
light
very
tight
suit
gardenia
in
his
cane
in
his
gloved
hands
fez
upon
his
head
for
all
their
smiling
welcome
his
full
dark
eyes
were
uneasy
he
had
grown
distrustful
of
surprises
it
was
mclean
affair
to
reassure
him
far
from
fulminating
any
accusations
the
canny
scot
announced
himself
as
the
bearer
of
glad
tidings
a
fortune
he
announced
was
coming
to
the
pasha
or
to
the
pasha
family
a
very
rich
old
woman
in
france
had
decided
to
change
her
will
there
he
paused
and
the
pasha
continued
to
smile
but
the
word
fortune
was
operating
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
was
hastily
trying
to
think
of
rich
old
women
in
france
who
might
change
their
wills
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
my
stupidity
which
has
kept
you
from
the
knowledge
of
this
for
some
weeks
mclean
went
on
i
had
so
many
other
matters
to
look
up
that
i
did
not
at
once
consult
my
records
and
it
has
been
so
many
years
since
you
married
madame
delcassé
that
the
name
had
slipped
general
recollection
it
was
twelve
years
ago
i
believe
that
she
died
casually
he
waited
and
jack
ryder
held
his
breath
he
felt
the
full
suspense
of
a
pause
long
enough
for
the
pasha
thoughts
to
dart
down
several
avenues
and
back
if
the
man
should
deny
it
but
why
should
he
what
harm
in
the
admission
after
all
these
years
with
madame
delcassé
dead
and
buried
and
with
a
fortune
involved
in
the
admission
the
turk
bowed
and
ryder
breathed
again
ten
years
said
tewfick
softly
ah
ten
but
there
has
been
no
communication
with
france
for
twelve
years
or
even
longer
possibly
not
monsieur
this
old
aunt
pursued
mclean
was
a
person
of
prejudice
as
well
as
fortune
hence
it
has
taken
a
little
time
for
her
to
adjust
herself
he
paused
and
looked
understandingly
at
the
turk
who
nodded
amiably
as
one
whose
comprehension
met
him
more
than
half
way
my
own
aunt
was
of
a
similar
obstinacy
he
murmured
he
added
this
fortune
you
speak
of
it
comes
through
my
wife
for
her
inheritors
madame
delcassé
the
former
madame
delcassé
i
should
say
left
but
one
daughter
again
the
pasha
bowed
and
again
ryder
felt
the
throb
of
triumph
he
looked
upon
his
friend
with
admiration
how
marvelously
mclean
had
worked
the
miracle
no
accusations
no
threats
no
obstacles
no
blank
walls
of
denial
not
a
ruffle
of
discord
in
the
establishment
of
these
salient
facts
the
marriage
of
madame
delcassé
to
the
pasha
and
the
existence
of
the
daughter
wonderful
man
mclean
he
had
never
half
appreciated
him
but
the
pasha
was
not
wholly
the
simple
assenter
do
i
understand
he
inquired
that
there
is
a
fortune
coming
from
france
for
my
daughter
and
at
mclean
confirmation
and
when
you
say
fortune
he
continued
you
intend
to
say
and
his
glance
now
took
in
the
silent
american
considering
that
some
cue
must
be
his
but
mclean
responded
the
figures
are
not
to
be
divulged
not
until
the
aunt
is
in
communication
with
her
niece
but
they
will
be
large
monsieur
for
this
aunt
is
a
person
of
great
wealth
and
yet
alive
to
enjoy
it
said
tewfick
with
smiling
eyes
an
aged
and
dying
woman
thrust
in
ryder
in
haste
her
only
care
now
is
to
see
her
niece
before
she
dies
ah
but
that
could
be
arranged
said
tewfick
amiably
we
have
at
once
communicated
with
france
mclean
told
him
but
we
came
instantly
to
you
to
inform
you
a
thousand
thanks
and
a
thousand
the
bearers
of
good
tidings
smiled
their
host
because
we
understand
that
there
is
a
question
of
the
young
marriage
pursued
mclean
and
you
would
of
course
wish
to
defer
this
until
these
new
circumstances
are
complied
with
the
pasha
stared
not
at
all
a
fortune
is
as
pleasant
to
a
wife
as
to
a
maid
there
are
so
many
questions
of
law
offered
mclean
with
purposeful
vagueness
french
wardship
and
trusteeship
and
all
that
it
would
be
advisable
i
think
to
wait
absurd
said
the
pasha
easily
you
would
want
no
doubts
cast
upon
the
legality
of
the
marriage
mclean
persisted
thoughtfully
and
since
mademoiselle
is
under
age
and
the
french
law
has
certain
restrictions
pff
we
are
not
under
the
french
law
at
least
i
have
not
heard
that
england
has
relinquished
her
power
retorted
tewfick
not
without
malice
but
mademoiselle
delcassé
is
french
thrust
in
ryder
he
knew
that
mclean
had
ventured
as
far
as
he
an
official
and
responsible
person
could
go
and
that
the
burden
of
intimation
must
rest
upon
himself
and
under
her
father
will
his
family
there
is
considered
in
trusteeship
so
there
would
be
certain
technicalities
that
must
be
considered
before
any
marriage
can
be
arranged
the
signature
of
the
french
guardian
the
settlement
of
the
dot
this
inheritance
for
instance
all
mere
formalities
but
involving
a
little
delay
tewfick
pasha
turned
in
his
chair
and
cocked
his
eyes
at
this
strange
young
man
who
had
dropped
from
the
blue
with
this
extensive
advice
he
looked
puzzled
this
american
fitted
into
no
type
of
his
acquaintance
he
was
so
very
young
and
slim
and
boyish
with
not
at
all
the
air
of
a
legal
representative
but
mclean
position
vouched
for
him
you
speak
for
the
french
family
monsieur
unhesitatingly
ryder
declared
that
he
did
then
you
may
inform
the
family
announced
tewfick
bristling
that
my
daughter
has
been
very
well
cared
for
all
these
years
without
advice
from
france
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
said
ryder
quickly
but
the
french
law
might
begin
to
entertain
doubts
of
it
if
mademoiselle
were
married
off
now
without
consultation
with
the
authorities
already
he
added
a
little
meaningly
as
the
other
shrugged
the
suggestion
away
there
have
been
questions
raised
concerning
the
mother
marriage
and
the
separation
of
the
little
mademoiselle
delcassé
from
her
relatives
in
france
and
now
if
she
were
to
be
married
without
any
legal
settlement
of
her
estate
steadily
he
sustained
the
other
gaze
while
his
unfinished
thought
seemed
to
float
significantly
in
the
air
about
them
have
a
cigarette
said
the
pasha
hospitably
extending
a
gold
case
monogrammed
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
ah
coffee
he
announced
welcomingly
as
a
little
black
boy
entered
with
a
brass
tray
of
steaming
cups
i
hope
gentlemen
that
you
like
my
coffee
it
is
not
the
usual
turkish
brew
no
this
comes
from
aden
the
finest
coffee
in
the
world
a
ship
captain
brings
it
to
me
especially
beamingly
he
sipped
the
scalding
stuff
then
darted
back
to
that
suspended
sentence
but
you
were
saying
something
of
a
trusteeship
do
i
understand
that
it
is
an
aunt
of
madame
delcassé
the
former
madame
delcassé
who
is
leaving
this
money
not
of
madame
but
of
monsieur
delcassé
mclean
informed
him
ah
that
accounts
but
in
that
case
then
there
need
be
no
concern
in
france
over
my
daughter
marriage
he
turned
his
round
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
a
moment
there
is
no
mademoiselle
delcassé
sir
said
ryder
sharply
there
is
no
mademoiselle
delcassé
repeated
the
pasha
his
eyes
frankly
enlivened
but
we
have
just
been
speaking
you
can
not
mean
to
say
we
have
been
speaking
of
my
daughter
the
daughter
of
the
former
madame
delcassé
smilingly
he
looked
upon
them
a
pity
that
we
did
not
understand
each
other
but
you
appear
to
know
so
much
and
i
supposed
that
you
knew
that
too
that
the
daughter
of
monsieur
delcassé
was
dead
neither
of
the
young
men
spoke
mclean
looked
politely
attentive
ryder
face
maintained
that
look
of
concentration
which
guarded
the
fluctuations
of
his
feelings
it
was
many
years
ago
the
pasha
murmured
putting
down
his
coffee
cup
and
selecting
another
cigarette
not
long
after
her
marriage
to
me
a
very
charming
little
girl
i
was
positively
attached
to
her
tewfick
added
reminiscently
well
well
well
what
a
pity
now
said
mclean
very
slowly
this
will
be
a
great
disappointment
and
so
the
present
mademoiselle
is
my
daughter
mclean
was
silent
ryder
could
hardly
trust
himself
to
speak
what
did
she
die
of
he
asked
at
last
in
a
voice
whose
edged
quality
brought
the
pasha
glance
to
him
with
a
flash
of
hostility
behind
its
veil
but
he
answered
calmly
enough
of
the
fever
monsieur
she
was
never
strong
and
her
grave
i
should
like
to
make
a
report
it
was
in
the
south
desert
burial
i
am
afraid
you
must
know
that
the
little
one
was
hardly
a
true
believer
for
our
cemetery
and
you
would
say
that
she
was
only
five
or
six
years
old
ryder
persisted
the
pasha
nodded
i
should
like
to
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
date
if
it
is
not
too
much
trouble
the
father
died
about
fifteen
years
ago
and
the
mother
was
married
to
you
soon
after
really
monsieur
you
tewfick
was
frankly
restive
i
know
nothing
of
the
father
he
said
sullenly
and
as
to
the
child
death
how
can
one
recall
after
these
years
in
one
two
years
after
she
came
to
me
one
does
not
grave
these
things
upon
the
eyeballs
but
you
do
remember
that
it
was
long
ago
when
your
own
daughter
was
very
little
exactly
that
is
my
recollection
monsieur
and
i
recall
said
the
pasha
suddenly
obliging
and
sentimental
that
even
my
little
one
cried
for
the
child
it
was
afflicting
assure
the
family
in
france
of
my
sympathy
in
their
disappointment
i
am
sorry
that
my
news
is
after
all
of
no
interest
to
you
observed
mclean
setting
the
example
for
rising
you
will
pardon
my
error
of
information
and
accept
my
appreciation
of
your
courtesy
it
is
i
who
am
indebted
for
your
trouble
their
host
assured
them
all
smiles
again
but
ryder
was
not
to
be
led
away
without
a
parting
shot
the
name
of
the
delcassé
child
was
aimée
imperceptibly
tewfick
hesitated
then
bowed
in
assent
odd
said
young
ryder
thoughtfully
and
your
own
daughter
name
also
is
aimée
two
little
ones
with
the
same
name
with
a
slight
vexed
laugh
as
one
despairing
of
understanding
the
pasha
turned
to
mclean
your
young
friend
monsieur
is
uninformed
that
turkish
children
have
many
names
after
the
loss
of
the
elder
we
called
the
little
one
by
the
same
name
i
trust
i
have
made
everything
perfectly
clear
to
you
as
crystal
said
mclean
politely
as
lightning
said
jack
ryder
hotly
striding
down
the
street
it
was
a
flash
of
invention
that
yarn
when
i
spoke
about
the
questions
raised
by
his
marriage
the
old
fox
sniffed
the
wind
and
was
afraid
of
trouble
he
decided
on
the
instant
that
no
future
fortune
was
worth
interference
with
his
plans
and
he
cut
the
ground
from
under
our
feet
lord
what
a
lie
masterly
you
must
admit
oh
i
admired
the
beggar
even
while
i
choked
on
it
but
fever
desert
burial
two
aimées
and
the
sentimental
face
he
pulled
he
ought
to
have
had
a
and
wailing
woodwinds
mclean
chuckled
i
believe
anything
of
him
now
ryder
rushed
on
i
bet
he
murdered
delcassé
and
kidnapped
the
mother
and
now
he
is
selling
their
daughter
i
fancy
murder
a
bit
beyond
our
tewfick
that
too
thick
probably
telling
the
truth
there
he
may
never
have
known
delcassé
and
as
for
the
widow
she
must
have
been
in
no
end
of
trouble
with
a
dead
man
and
a
wrecked
expedition
and
a
baby
on
her
hands
and
tewfick
may
have
offered
himself
as
a
grateful
solution
to
her
you
be
surprised
at
the
things
i
heard
and
if
she
looked
like
her
picture
tewfick
probably
laid
himself
out
to
be
lovely
to
her
i
rather
like
the
chap
myself
i
love
him
ryder
snorted
the
infernal
liar
steady
now
suppose
it
all
the
truth
nothing
impossible
to
it
fact
is
i
rather
believe
it
said
mclean
imperturbably
it
hangs
together
if
this
girl
you
met
thinks
she
his
daughter
conclusive
she
have
some
idea
servants
gossip
or
family
whisperings
and
why
should
he
have
brought
her
up
as
his
own
no
other
children
and
he
grown
fond
of
her
of
course
if
you
could
see
her
retorted
ryder
just
as
well
i
ca
and
i
think
he
could
hardly
have
kept
her
in
the
dark
we
better
call
it
a
wild
goose
chase
and
say
the
man
telling
the
truth
if
this
girl
were
his
daughter
she
could
be
more
than
fourteen
years
old
and
i
seen
the
girl
and
she
eighteen
if
she
a
day
you
might
take
her
for
twenty
said
ryder
in
repudiating
scorn
hesitating
mclean
murmured
something
about
the
early
maturity
of
the
natives
natives
ryder
flung
angrily
back
this
girl
french
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
jack
this
girl
is
turkish
and
fourteen
we
ca
get
around
that
and
you
had
better
not
forget
it
his
friend
quietly
advised
we
done
everything
that
we
can
and
there
is
no
use
working
yourself
up
if
anybody
to
blame
in
this
business
i
do
think
it
tewfick
he
done
the
handsome
thing
by
her
but
the
fool
frenchman
who
took
his
baby
and
his
wife
into
the
desert
and
it
too
late
to
rag
him
cheer
up
old
top
and
forget
it
there
nothing
more
to
be
done
it
was
sound
advice
jack
ryder
knew
it
they
had
done
all
that
they
could
mclean
had
been
a
brick
there
remained
nothing
now
but
to
notify
the
delcassé
aunt
that
tewfick
pasha
claimed
the
child
and
i
a
notion
jack
said
mclean
thoughtfully
that
he
might
not
have
done
that
if
you
had
rushed
him
so
trying
to
break
off
the
marriage
that
was
what
frightened
him
i
thought
you
said
she
was
his
own
daughter
ryder
responded
indignantly
and
to
that
mclean
merely
murmured
she
will
be
now
to
all
time
it
was
a
haunting
thought
it
left
ryder
with
the
bitter
taste
of
blame
in
his
mouth
the
gall
and
wormwood
of
blame
and
a
baffled
defeat
but
for
that
sense
of
blame
he
might
have
taken
mclean
advice
he
might
but
for
that
have
gone
the
way
of
wisdom
and
accepted
the
inevitable
as
it
was
he
did
none
of
these
things
he
said
to
himself
that
all
that
he
could
do
now
and
the
least
that
he
could
do
was
to
let
the
girl
know
as
much
of
the
story
as
he
knew
and
draw
her
own
conclusions
then
if
she
wanted
to
go
on
and
sacrifice
herself
for
tewfick
very
well
that
was
none
of
his
affair
but
she
had
a
right
to
the
truth
and
to
the
chance
of
choice
he
did
not
know
what
he
could
do
but
secretly
and
defiantly
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
do
something
and
in
the
back
of
his
mind
an
idea
was
already
taking
shape
it
was
manifest
in
the
tenacity
with
which
he
refused
to
send
the
locket
to
the
delcassés
he
had
the
case
and
the
miniature
photographed
very
carefully
by
the
man
who
did
the
reproductions
for
museum
illustrations
and
he
sent
that
conscious
of
mclean
silent
thought
that
he
was
cherishing
the
portrait
for
a
sentimental
memory
but
he
had
other
plans
for
it
he
did
not
return
to
his
diggings
he
sent
a
message
to
the
deserted
thatcher
faking
errands
in
cairo
and
he
took
a
room
at
the
hotel
where
jinny
jeffries
now
up
the
nile
had
stayed
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
evenings
in
the
hotel
garden
staring
over
the
brick
walls
to
the
tops
of
distant
palms
beyond
and
not
infrequently
he
slipped
out
the
garden
back
door
and
wandered
up
and
down
the
dark
canyon
of
a
lane
he
might
as
well
have
walked
up
and
down
the
veranda
of
hotel
and
yet
the
girl
had
her
key
she
could
get
away
if
she
wanted
to
and
she
might
want
to
if
she
knew
the
truth
but
how
to
get
that
truth
to
her
that
was
his
problem
a
dozen
plans
he
considered
and
rejected
there
were
the
mails
simple
and
obvious
channel
but
he
had
a
strong
idea
that
maidens
in
mohammedan
seclusion
do
not
receive
their
letters
directly
and
now
especially
tewfick
would
be
on
his
guard
then
there
was
the
chance
of
a
message
through
some
native
hands
the
house
servants
there
were
hours
one
day
when
ryder
sauntered
about
the
streets
covertly
eyeing
the
who
stood
holding
a
horse
in
the
sun
or
the
tattered
boy
approaching
the
entrance
with
his
long
loaves
upon
his
head
but
ryder
arabic
was
not
of
a
power
or
subtlety
to
corrupt
any
creature
and
he
stayed
his
tongue
bitterly
he
regretted
his
wasted
years
if
he
had
not
misspent
them
in
godly
living
he
would
now
be
upon
such
terms
of
intimacy
with
some
official
pretty
wife
who
had
the
entrée
to
a
pasha
daughter
that
she
could
be
induced
to
make
use
of
it
for
him
desperately
he
thought
of
remedying
this
defect
there
were
several
charming
young
matrons
not
averse
to
devoted
young
men
but
the
time
was
short
for
establishing
those
confidential
relations
which
were
what
he
required
now
jinny
jeffries
would
do
it
for
him
if
she
could
but
jinny
would
not
return
for
another
week
and
if
she
changed
her
mind
and
took
the
boat
back
as
he
alack
had
advised
instead
of
the
express
then
she
would
be
longer
and
meanwhile
the
days
were
passing
four
of
them
now
since
he
and
mclean
had
heard
the
soudanese
locking
the
door
behind
them
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
trust
to
that
idea
which
had
been
slowly
shaping
in
his
mind
chapter
ix
a
wedding
present
in
a
room
high
in
the
palace
a
young
girl
was
trying
on
a
frock
before
a
tall
pier
glass
she
stood
indifferently
one
hip
sagging
to
the
despair
of
the
kneeling
seamstress
her
face
turned
listlessly
from
the
image
in
the
glass
through
the
open
window
banded
with
three
bars
she
looked
into
the
rustling
tops
of
palms
from
which
the
yellow
date
fruit
hung
and
beyond
the
palms
the
hot
bright
blue
sky
and
the
far
towers
of
a
minaret
a
bit
more
to
the
left
you
please
miss
the
woman
entreated
through
a
mouthful
of
pins
and
apathetically
the
young
figure
moved
a
bit
of
right
now
that
drape
the
woman
chirped
sitting
back
on
her
heels
to
survey
her
work
she
was
an
odd
figure
with
a
sharp
nose
on
one
side
of
her
head
and
an
outstanding
knob
of
hair
on
the
other
into
that
knob
the
thin
locks
were
so
tightly
strained
that
her
pointed
features
had
an
effect
of
popping
out
of
bondage
she
was
london
born
brought
out
by
an
english
official
wife
as
dressmaker
to
the
children
remaining
in
cairo
as
wife
of
a
british
corporal
since
no
children
had
resulted
to
require
her
care
and
the
corporal
maintained
his
distaste
for
thrift
hendricks
had
resumed
her
old
trade
and
had
become
a
familiar
figure
to
many
fashionable
turkish
harems
slipping
in
and
out
morning
and
evening
sewing
busily
away
behind
the
bars
upon
frocks
that
would
have
graced
a
court
ball
and
lunching
in
familiar
sociability
with
the
family
sometimes
having
a
bey
or
a
captain
or
a
pasha
for
a
when
the
men
in
the
family
dropped
in
for
luncheon
as
the
girl
did
not
turn
her
head
she
looked
for
approbation
to
the
third
person
in
the
room
a
tall
severely
handsome
frenchwoman
in
black
whose
face
had
the
beauty
of
chiseled
marble
and
the
same
quality
of
cold
perfection
this
was
madame
de
coulevain
teacher
of
french
and
literature
to
the
of
cairo
former
governess
of
aimée
returned
now
to
her
old
room
in
the
palace
for
the
wedding
preparations
there
was
history
behind
madame
sculptured
face
in
an
incredibly
impulsive
youth
she
had
fled
from
france
with
a
handsome
captain
of
algerian
dragoons
after
a
certain
matter
at
cards
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
captain
and
became
petty
official
in
a
cairo
importing
house
later
yet
he
became
an
invalid
life
for
the
frenchwoman
was
a
matter
of
paying
for
her
illness
then
for
his
funeral
expenses
and
then
of
continuing
to
pay
for
the
little
one
which
the
climate
had
required
them
to
send
to
a
convent
in
france
there
was
at
first
the
hope
of
reunion
extinguished
by
each
added
year
what
could
madame
unknown
unfriended
unaccredited
accomplish
in
france
the
mere
getting
there
was
impossible
the
little
one
required
so
much
her
daughter
was
no
dependent
upon
charity
and
in
cairo
madame
had
a
clientèle
she
commanded
a
price
and
so
for
the
child
sake
she
taught
and
saved
concentrating
now
upon
a
dot
and
feeding
her
heart
with
the
dutifully
phrased
letters
arriving
each
week
of
the
years
and
the
occasional
photographs
of
an
unknown
young
creature
it
was
to
madame
care
that
aimée
had
been
given
when
the
motherless
girl
had
grown
beyond
old
miriam
ministrations
and
for
nearly
nine
years
in
the
palace
madame
had
maintained
her
courteous
and
tactful
supervision
indeed
it
was
only
this
last
year
that
madame
had
undertaken
new
relations
with
the
world
outside
perceiving
that
aimée
would
not
longer
require
her
excellent
she
said
now
in
her
careful
unfamiliar
english
to
hendricks
and
in
french
to
aimée
she
added
with
a
hint
of
asperity
do
give
her
a
word
she
is
trying
to
please
you
it
is
very
nice
hendricks
said
the
girl
dutifully
bringing
her
glance
back
from
that
far
sky
the
little
seamstress
was
instantly
all
vivacity
now
for
the
sash
shall
we
it
so
or
so
she
demanded
attaching
the
wisp
of
tulle
experimentally
as
you
wish
it
it
is
very
nice
aimée
repeated
vaguely
she
picked
up
a
bit
of
the
shimmering
stuff
and
spread
it
curiously
across
her
fingers
a
dinner
gown
when
she
wore
this
she
would
be
a
wife
the
wife
of
hamdi
bey
a
shiver
went
through
her
and
she
dropped
the
tulle
swiftly
in
ten
days
more
gone
was
her
first
rush
of
sustaining
compassion
gone
was
her
fear
for
her
father
and
her
tenderness
to
him
only
this
numb
coldness
this
dumb
helpless
certainty
of
a
destiny
about
to
be
accomplished
only
this
hopeless
useless
brooding
upon
that
strange
brief
past
there
was
a
stir
at
the
door
and
on
her
shuffling
slippered
feet
old
miriam
entered
handing
some
packages
to
madame
de
coulevain
then
she
turned
to
revolve
about
the
bright
figure
of
her
young
mistress
her
eyes
glistening
fondly
her
dark
fingers
touching
a
soft
fold
of
silver
ribbon
while
under
her
breath
she
chanted
in
a
croon
like
a
lullaby
beautiful
as
the
dawn
she
will
walk
upon
the
heart
of
her
husband
with
foot
of
rose
petals
she
will
dazzle
him
with
the
beams
of
her
eyes
and
with
the
locks
of
her
hair
she
will
bind
him
to
her
beautiful
as
the
dawn
it
was
the
marriage
chant
of
miriam
native
village
an
old
love
song
that
had
come
down
the
wind
of
centuries
hendricks
thrusting
in
the
final
pins
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
and
madame
de
coulevain
displayed
interest
only
in
the
packages
if
she
saw
the
stiffening
of
the
girl
face
and
the
rigid
aversion
of
her
eyes
from
the
old
nurse
adulation
she
gave
no
sign
towards
aimée
moods
madame
preserved
a
calm
and
sensible
detachment
never
had
she
invited
confidence
and
for
all
the
young
girl
charm
she
had
never
taken
her
to
her
heart
in
the
place
of
that
absent
daughter
as
if
jealously
she
had
held
herself
aloof
from
such
devotion
perhaps
in
aimée
indulged
and
petted
childhood
with
a
fond
pasha
extolling
her
small
triumphs
her
dances
her
score
at
tennis
at
the
legation
madame
found
a
bitter
contrast
to
the
lot
of
that
lonely
child
in
france
certainly
there
was
nothing
in
aimée
life
then
to
invite
compassion
and
later
during
those
hard
mutinous
months
of
the
girl
first
veiling
and
seclusion
she
had
not
tried
to
soften
the
inevitable
for
her
with
a
useless
compassion
so
now
perceiving
this
marriage
as
one
more
step
in
the
irresistible
march
of
destiny
for
her
charge
she
overlooked
the
youthful
fretting
and
offered
the
example
of
her
own
unmoved
acceptance
what
diamonds
she
said
now
admiringly
holding
up
a
pin
and
examining
the
card
from
seniha
hanum
the
cousin
of
hamdi
bey
a
moment
more
she
held
up
the
pin
but
the
girl
would
not
give
it
a
look
and
this
from
the
same
jeweler
continued
madame
while
the
dressmaker
was
unfastening
the
frock
aided
by
miriam
anxious
that
no
scratch
should
mar
that
skin
how
droll
the
box
is
wrapped
in
cloth
a
cloth
of
plaid
aimée
spun
about
the
dress
fell
a
glistening
circle
at
her
feet
and
with
regardless
haste
she
tripped
over
it
to
madame
how
strange
she
said
breathlessly
a
plaid
a
scotch
plaid
memories
of
an
erect
young
figure
of
a
thin
bronzed
face
and
dark
hair
where
a
tilted
cap
sat
rakishly
memories
of
smiling
boyish
eyes
darkening
with
sudden
emotion
memories
of
eager
lips
she
took
the
box
from
madame
within
the
cloth
lay
a
jeweler
case
and
within
the
case
a
locket
of
heavily
ornamented
gold
her
heart
beating
she
opened
it
for
a
moment
she
did
not
understand
her
own
face
her
own
face
smiling
back
yet
unfamiliar
that
oddly
piled
hair
that
black
velvet
ribbon
about
the
throat
murmuring
madame
shared
her
wonder
it
was
miriam
cry
of
recognition
that
told
them
thy
mother
the
grace
of
allah
upon
her
it
is
thy
mother
eh
those
bright
eyes
that
long
dark
hair
that
i
brushed
the
many
hot
nights
upon
the
roof
but
you
are
her
image
aimée
murmured
the
frenchwoman
but
half
understanding
the
nurse
rapid
gutturals
and
then
your
gift
with
the
box
in
her
hands
the
girl
turned
from
them
fearful
of
the
color
in
her
cheeks
but
whose
else
his
thought
of
course
she
stammered
that
plaid
was
warning
her
of
mystery
the
dressmaker
was
creating
a
diversion
leaving
she
wished
to
consult
about
the
purchases
for
work
and
madame
moved
towards
the
hall
with
her
talking
in
her
careful
english
while
miriam
bent
towards
the
dropped
finery
aimée
slipped
through
another
door
into
the
twilight
of
her
bedroom
whose
windows
upon
the
street
were
darkened
by
those
screens
of
wood
swiftly
she
thrust
the
box
from
sight
into
the
hollow
in
the
mashrubiyeh
made
in
old
days
to
hold
a
water
bottle
where
it
could
be
cooled
by
breezes
from
the
street
leaning
against
the
woodwork
her
fingers
curving
through
the
tiny
openings
she
stared
toward
the
west
the
sky
was
flushing
broken
by
the
circles
the
squares
the
minute
interstices
of
the
mashrubiyeh
she
saw
the
city
taking
on
the
hues
of
sunset
suddenly
the
cry
of
a
muezzin
from
a
nearby
minaret
came
rising
and
falling
through
the
streets
illahé
illallah
mohammedun
the
call
swelled
and
died
away
and
rose
again
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
mahomet
is
the
prophet
of
god
from
farther
towers
it
sounded
echoing
and
vibrant
insistent
falling
upon
crowded
streets
penetrating
muffling
walls
illahé
in
the
avenue
beneath
her
two
arabs
leading
their
camels
to
market
were
removing
their
shoes
and
going
through
the
gestures
of
ceremonial
washing
with
the
dust
of
the
street
the
city
was
ringing
with
it
the
seamstress
and
the
frenchwoman
still
talking
had
passed
down
the
hall
in
the
next
room
miriam
lips
were
moving
in
pious
testimony
hedu
en
la
i
testify
that
there
is
no
god
but
god
in
the
street
the
arabs
were
bowing
towards
the
east
their
heads
touching
the
earth
and
in
the
window
above
them
a
girl
was
reading
a
note
the
last
call
of
the
muezzin
falling
from
the
tardy
towers
of
kait
bey
drifted
faintly
through
the
colored
air
with
resounding
whacks
the
arabs
were
urging
on
their
beast
miriam
her
prayers
concluded
was
shaking
out
silks
and
tulle
with
a
sidelong
glance
for
that
still
figure
in
the
next
room
pressing
so
close
against
the
guarding
screens
she
could
not
see
the
pallor
in
the
young
face
she
could
not
see
the
tumult
in
the
dark
eyes
she
could
not
see
the
note
crushed
convulsively
against
the
beating
breast
in
the
fingers
which
so
few
moments
ago
had
drawn
it
from
the
hiding
place
in
the
box
ryder
had
not
dared
a
personal
letter
but
clearly
and
distinctly
he
stated
the
story
of
the
delcassés
he
gave
the
facts
which
the
pasha
admitted
and
the
ingenious
explanation
of
the
two
aimées
and
for
reference
he
gave
the
address
of
the
delcassé
aunt
and
agent
in
france
and
of
ryder
and
mclean
at
the
agricultural
bank
the
pasha
did
not
dine
with
his
daughter
that
night
he
had
been
avoiding
her
of
late
a
natural
reaction
from
the
strain
of
gratitude
a
man
can
not
be
continually
humble
before
the
young
and
it
was
no
pleasure
to
be
reminded
by
her
candid
eyes
of
his
late
misfortunes
and
of
her
absurd
reluctance
towards
matrimony
as
if
this
marriage
were
not
the
best
thing
for
her
as
if
it
were
a
hardship
to
make
sad
eyes
and
draw
a
mouth
because
one
is
to
be
the
wife
of
a
rich
general
irrational
the
little
sweetmeat
was
irritating
to
this
point
tewfick
buoyancy
had
brought
him
and
all
the
more
hastily
because
of
his
eagerness
to
escape
the
pangs
of
that
uncomfortable
to
aimée
in
her
new
of
misery
it
was
bitterly
apparent
that
he
was
reconciled
with
her
lot
and
careless
of
it
so
blinded
had
been
her
young
affection
that
it
was
a
hard
awakening
and
she
was
too
young
too
cruelly
involved
to
feel
for
his
easy
humors
that
amused
tolerance
of
larger
acquaintance
with
human
nature
she
had
grown
swiftly
bitter
and
resentful
and
deeply
cold
and
now
this
letter
it
dazed
her
like
a
flame
of
lightning
before
her
eyes
and
then
like
lightning
it
lit
up
the
world
with
terrifying
luridity
fiery
colored
unfamiliar
her
life
trembled
about
her
truth
or
lies
custom
and
habit
stirred
incredulously
to
reject
the
supposition
the
romance
the
adventure
of
youth
dared
its
swift
acceptance
how
could
she
know
intuitively
she
shrank
from
any
question
to
the
pasha
realizing
the
folly
and
futility
of
exposing
her
suspicion
if
he
needed
to
lie
lie
he
would
and
in
her
understanding
of
that
she
read
her
own
acceptance
of
the
possibility
of
his
needing
to
lie
madame
de
coulevain
madame
had
never
known
her
mother
only
old
miriam
had
known
her
mother
and
miriam
was
the
pasha
slave
but
the
old
woman
was
unsuspecting
now
and
full
of
disarming
comfort
in
this
marriage
of
her
wild
darling
through
dinner
she
planned
the
questions
and
then
in
her
negligée
as
the
old
nurse
brushed
out
her
hair
for
the
night
dadi
said
the
girl
in
a
faint
voice
am
i
truly
like
my
mother
and
when
miriam
had
finished
her
fond
protestation
that
they
were
as
like
as
two
roses
as
two
white
roses
bloom
and
bud
she
launched
that
little
cunning
phrase
on
which
she
had
spent
such
eager
hoping
and
was
i
like
her
when
i
was
little
when
first
she
came
to
my
father
eh
yes
always
thou
wast
the
tiny
image
which
allah
glory
to
his
name
had
made
of
her
came
the
nurse
assurance
i
am
glad
said
aimée
in
a
trembling
voice
she
dared
not
press
that
more
confronted
with
her
unconscious
admission
the
old
woman
would
destroy
it
feigning
some
evasion
but
there
it
was
for
as
much
as
it
was
worth
presently
then
she
found
another
question
to
slip
into
the
old
woman
narrative
of
the
pasha
grief
eh
to
hear
a
man
weep
miriam
was
murmuring
her
beauty
had
set
its
spell
upon
him
and
and
he
lost
her
so
soon
three
or
four
years
only
was
it
not
ventured
aimée
that
they
had
of
life
together
it
seemed
that
miriam
brush
missed
a
stroke
years
i
forget
the
nurse
muttered
but
tears
i
remember
and
she
began
to
talk
of
other
things
but
it
seemed
to
aimée
that
she
had
answered
as
for
that
other
matter
of
the
dead
delcassé
child
she
dared
not
refer
to
it
lest
miriam
tell
the
pasha
but
how
many
times
she
remembered
had
she
been
told
that
she
was
her
mother
only
one
yet
oh
to
know
to
hear
all
the
story
to
learn
ryder
discovery
of
it
it
was
all
as
strange
and
startling
as
a
tale
of
djinns
and
the
life
that
it
held
out
to
her
the
enchanted
hope
of
freedom
of
aid
oh
not
again
would
she
refuse
his
aid
she
had
no
plans
no
purposes
but
that
night
over
her
frock
she
slipped
the
black
street
mantle
and
when
at
last
after
endless
waiting
the
murmuring
old
palace
was
safely
still
and
dark
she
stole
down
the
spiral
stair
and
gained
the
garden
and
then
a
phantom
among
its
shadows
she
fled
to
the
rose
bushes
by
the
gate
breathlessly
she
knelt
and
dug
into
the
hiding
place
of
that
key
to
the
furthest
corner
her
fingers
explored
the
hole
pushing
furiously
against
the
earth
and
then
she
drew
back
her
hand
and
crushed
it
against
her
face
to
check
the
nervous
sobs
the
hole
was
empty
the
key
was
gone
chapter
x
the
reception
in
tewfick
pasha
harem
everything
was
astir
it
was
the
morning
of
the
marriage
almost
the
very
hour
when
the
wedding
cortège
would
bear
the
bride
from
her
father
home
to
the
house
of
her
husband
the
invited
guests
were
already
arrived
and
streaming
through
the
reception
rooms
a
bright
feminine
tide
in
evening
toilettes
surrounding
the
exhibited
gifts
or
pausing
about
tables
of
cool
syrups
and
their
soft
low
voices
the
delicious
musical
tones
of
highbred
turkish
women
rose
like
a
murmuring
of
somnolent
bees
to
the
tenser
regions
about
tightening
the
excitement
of
haste
the
bride
was
not
yet
ready
still
and
white
she
was
the
only
image
of
calm
in
that
fluttering
confusing
room
her
nearer
friends
were
hovering
about
her
and
her
maids
of
honor
two
charming
little
turks
in
rose
robes
were
draping
her
veil
while
old
miriam
resplendent
in
green
and
silver
endeavored
jealously
to
outmaneuver
them
on
her
knees
the
hendricks
was
adding
an
orange
blossom
to
the
laces
on
the
train
then
she
sat
back
on
her
heels
her
head
like
a
curious
bird
her
eyes
beaming
sentimentally
upon
the
bride
the
prettiest
did
see
she
pronounced
with
satisfaction
pretty
as
a
wax
figger
now
a
thought
waxy
and
like
a
wax
figure
indeed
immobile
rigid
the
bride
was
standing
before
them
arrayed
at
last
in
the
shimmering
white
of
the
sweeping
satin
overrich
of
lace
and
orange
flowers
and
shrouded
in
the
clouding
waves
of
her
veil
white
as
her
robes
pale
as
death
and
as
still
the
girl
looked
out
at
them
and
only
that
sick
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
glitter
of
her
dark
eyes
betrayed
the
tumult
within
your
diadem
my
dear
you
are
keeping
us
attending
came
madame
de
coulevain
voice
from
the
door
the
diadem
that
heavy
circlet
of
brilliants
which
crowned
the
eastern
bride
in
place
of
the
orange
wreath
of
western
convention
must
not
be
touched
by
the
bride
fingers
but
placed
by
one
of
her
friends
married
and
married
but
once
and
exceptionally
happy
in
that
marriage
aimée
selection
from
her
friends
stepped
hastily
forward
now
a
soft
dimpled
girl
her
eyes
drowsy
with
domesticity
no
question
of
happiness
she
extolled
her
husband
a
young
captain
of
cavalry
and
she
adored
her
infant
son
a
prodigy
among
children
life
for
her
was
a
rosy
unquestioning
absorption
a
shaft
of
irony
sped
through
aimée
as
she
bent
her
head
for
its
crowning
at
this
young
wife
hands
and
received
the
ceremonial
wishes
for
her
crowning
of
happiness
a
crowning
occurring
but
once
in
her
lifetime
irony
was
the
only
salvation
for
the
hour
without
that
outlet
for
her
tortured
spirit
she
felt
she
would
grow
suddenly
mad
hysterical
and
babbling
or
passionate
and
wild
so
many
moods
had
stormed
through
her
since
that
night
when
she
had
found
all
hope
of
rescue
gone
with
her
lost
key
so
many
impulses
seethed
frantically
now
beneath
her
quiet
as
she
faced
for
the
last
time
that
image
in
the
glass
she
had
a
furious
longing
to
tear
off
that
diadem
and
veil
and
heavy
robe
to
scatter
the
ornaments
and
drive
out
all
those
maddening
spectators
all
those
interested
eager
unknowing
uncaring
spectators
of
her
humiliation
arranging
her
veil
draping
her
satins
as
if
gauze
and
silk
were
all
that
mattered
to
this
hour
wishing
her
happiness
as
if
happiness
could
ever
be
hers
now
for
the
wishing
smiling
fluttering
complimenting
lending
to
the
ghastly
sacrifice
the
familiar
acceptances
of
every
day
if
only
she
could
wake
from
this
nightmare
and
find
that
it
was
all
a
dream
if
only
she
could
brush
this
confusion
from
her
senses
and
from
her
heart
its
dumb
terrors
if
only
she
had
the
courage
for
some
desperate
revolt
some
outburst
of
strength
i
am
ready
she
said
faintly
turning
from
the
glass
and
moved
towards
the
door
while
a
young
eunuch
bent
for
her
train
that
train
of
three
yards
length
which
stretched
so
regally
behind
her
in
her
slow
descent
of
the
stairs
in
the
french
below
her
father
was
waiting
for
the
ceremonial
farewell
in
which
the
father
received
the
thanks
for
all
his
care
of
her
mechanically
aimée
advanced
she
stood
before
him
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
there
passed
from
them
a
look
of
such
strange
breathless
questioning
intensity
that
it
was
like
something
palpable
she
had
not
foreseen
this
sudden
crisping
of
her
nerves
this
defiant
passion
of
her
spirit
her
father
was
he
her
father
was
it
a
father
who
had
sold
her
so
careless
callous
or
was
it
only
a
father
semblance
and
did
there
lie
in
the
background
of
those
petted
childish
years
some
darker
shadow
of
a
tragedy
that
had
wrecked
her
mother
life
and
broken
her
heart
like
flashing
light
that
look
passed
between
them
it
penetrated
tewfick
nonchalant
guard
and
brought
the
unaccustomed
color
to
his
olive
cheeks
his
handsome
eyes
turned
uneasily
aside
a
pique
perhaps
at
the
situation
her
last
defiance
of
his
power
but
for
all
his
reassurance
there
was
something
deeper
in
that
look
something
tenable
accusing
which
went
into
his
soul
it
was
a
moment
in
which
the
last
cord
of
their
relationship
was
severed
forever
she
did
not
speak
a
word
she
bent
not
to
kiss
his
hand
as
custom
dictated
but
to
sweep
a
long
slow
courtesy
that
salutation
of
a
maid
of
spirit
to
a
conqueror
a
bending
of
the
pliant
back
but
with
the
head
held
high
and
the
spirit
unsurrendered
and
yet
there
was
wretchedness
in
those
proud
eyes
and
a
blind
fear
and
supplication
useless
to
beg
now
she
knew
it
and
yet
the
eyes
implored
and
then
she
smiled
and
before
that
smile
tewfick
faltered
in
his
paternal
benediction
and
hastened
the
phrases
little
murmurs
flew
back
and
forth
as
she
turned
away
and
then
a
hasty
chatter
sprang
up
as
the
guests
hurried
into
their
tcharchafs
for
the
journey
to
the
bridegroom
house
that
day
aimée
did
not
put
on
her
veil
on
either
side
of
her
as
she
went
out
her
father
gate
huge
negroes
held
up
silken
walls
of
damask
and
between
those
walls
she
walked
into
the
carriage
that
awaited
her
followed
by
madame
de
coulevain
and
the
two
little
maids
of
honor
it
was
when
the
carriage
began
to
move
that
the
panic
inside
of
her
grew
to
whirlwind
the
horse
hoofs
trotting
trotting
the
motion
of
the
wheels
seemed
to
be
the
onbearing
rush
of
fate
itself
if
she
could
only
stop
it
if
she
could
only
cry
out
tear
open
the
windows
scream
to
the
passers
by
she
knew
these
were
only
the
impotent
visions
of
hysteria
but
she
indulged
them
pitifully
she
saw
herself
in
those
moments
helpless
and
hopeless
passing
on
into
the
slavery
of
this
marriage
aimée
no
longer
the
daughter
of
tewfick
pasha
but
aimée
delcassé
child
of
a
dead
frenchman
inheritor
of
freedom
sold
like
any
dancing
girl
and
her
own
lips
had
assented
in
the
supreme
silly
uselessness
of
sacrifice
she
had
given
herself
for
the
safety
of
that
man
who
had
spent
such
careless
indulgence
upon
her
that
man
whom
perhaps
her
mother
had
loved
and
perhaps
had
hated
faster
and
faster
the
horses
were
trotting
leading
the
long
file
of
carriages
and
impatient
motors
that
bore
the
relatives
and
guests
and
trousseau
rolling
on
under
the
lebbeks
and
sycamores
of
the
wide
shubra
avenue
once
the
delight
of
fashionables
before
the
gezireh
drive
had
drained
it
of
its
throngs
and
its
prestige
now
some
urchins
ran
out
from
their
games
in
the
dust
to
curious
attention
and
through
a
half
open
gate
aimée
caught
once
a
glimpse
of
a
young
unveiled
girl
watching
eagerly
from
the
tangled
greens
and
ruined
statuary
of
an
old
garden
farther
on
came
glimpses
of
farm
lands
the
wheat
rising
in
bright
spears
and
of
heights
and
in
the
distance
the
white
houses
of
demerdache
against
the
gibel
achmar
beyond
but
where
were
they
bearing
her
aimée
had
a
despairing
sense
of
distance
and
desolation
as
the
carriage
turned
again
abdullah
the
coachman
having
traversed
unnecessary
miles
to
gratify
his
pride
before
the
house
of
his
parents
and
made
a
zigzag
way
towards
the
river
where
old
palaces
rose
from
the
backwaters
their
faces
hidden
by
high
walls
or
covered
with
heavy
vines
and
moss
deeper
and
deeper
grew
the
girl
dismay
it
was
a
different
world
from
that
bright
modern
cairo
that
she
knew
this
was
as
remote
from
her
daily
life
as
the
old
streets
of
al
raschid
her
thoughts
flew
forward
to
that
unknown
lord
that
hamdi
bey
whose
image
she
had
refused
to
assemble
to
her
consciousness
now
she
comforted
her
terror
with
a
sudden
assumption
of
age
and
dignity
and
kindness
of
a
courtesy
that
would
protect
her
and
a
deference
that
would
assuage
the
horror
of
a
life
together
when
unknown
fearful
familiarities
would
alone
vibrate
in
the
empty
monotonies
before
a
high
wall
the
carriage
had
stopped
a
huge
repellent
ethiopian
was
standing
before
an
opened
doorway
through
which
a
rich
carpet
was
spread
ah
but
he
looks
like
an
ogre
that
new
eunuch
of
yours
aimée
murmured
one
of
the
little
turks
the
other
more
touched
with
thought
gave
her
a
disturbed
glance
and
laughed
in
nervousness
madame
alone
serene
ignored
the
dismaying
impression
the
palace
is
of
a
fine
ancient
beauty
i
am
told
she
mentioned
cheerfully
for
one
wild
instant
aimée
thought
to
plead
with
her
to
implore
her
to
tell
abdullah
to
drive
on
to
give
her
the
freedom
of
flight
if
only
flight
down
those
deserted
streets
and
then
a
mad
vision
of
herself
in
her
bridal
robes
in
flight
brought
the
hysterical
laughter
to
her
throat
the
time
for
flight
had
gone
by
and
as
for
madame
pity
on
her
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
aimée
had
thought
of
invoking
her
aid
but
she
had
always
known
too
well
that
thought
supreme
futility
sympathetic
as
madame
de
coulevain
might
be
in
her
inmost
heart
and
aimée
divined
in
her
an
understanding
pity
for
the
necessities
of
existence
never
would
that
sympathy
betray
her
to
rashness
she
never
would
believe
that
in
serving
aimée
she
would
not
be
ruining
her
and
even
if
assured
of
aimée
safety
she
could
never
be
brought
to
betray
her
own
reputation
for
truthworthiness
among
the
harems
of
cairo
as
well
appeal
to
the
rocks
of
the
mokattam
hills
the
carriage
stopped
the
negroes
extended
the
damask
walls
and
one
sprang
to
open
the
carriage
door
and
bear
the
bride
train
in
one
moment
parting
of
the
silken
walls
the
girl
saw
a
cluster
of
staring
faces
thronging
for
her
arrival
and
then
the
damask
intervened
and
through
its
lane
followed
by
her
duenna
and
her
maids
of
honor
she
entered
the
arched
doorway
she
was
in
a
garden
a
great
gloomy
place
with
ancient
trees
a
broken
marble
fountain
flung
up
waters
into
which
no
sunlight
flashed
and
the
heavy
stepping
stones
leading
to
it
were
buried
in
untrodden
grass
a
garden
in
which
no
one
lingered
the
ethiopian
was
marshaling
them
to
the
left
to
an
entrance
in
the
dark
palace
walls
before
them
behind
them
the
oncoming
guests
were
streaming
out
in
veiled
procession
he
opened
a
door
ancient
beautiful
arches
framed
a
long
vestibule
and
against
a
background
of
profuse
cut
flowers
a
man
figure
stepped
forward
in
the
glittering
uniform
of
the
sultan
guard
aimée
had
a
confused
impression
of
a
thin
meager
dandified
figure
with
a
waspish
waist
of
a
blond
mustache
with
upstanding
ends
of
sallow
and
small
light
eyes
smiling
at
her
in
a
strained
eager
curiosity
through
all
her
sinking
dismay
she
had
a
flash
of
clear
enlightening
irony
at
that
look
suspense
if
she
were
not
as
represented
if
his
cousin
fervor
had
misled
his
hope
but
in
that
instant
encounter
his
eyes
cleared
to
triumph
and
gayety
and
he
smiled
a
smile
curiously
feline
ironic
for
all
its
intended
ingratiation
a
conqueror
smile
winged
to
reassure
and
melt
he
stepped
forward
there
were
formal
words
of
welcome
to
which
she
returned
a
speechless
bow
and
then
he
offered
his
arm
and
conducted
her
slowly
up
the
stairs
his
sword
rattling
in
its
scabbard
to
the
apartment
which
was
to
be
her
home
and
the
prison
for
the
spirit
and
the
body
she
knew
in
a
moment
that
she
hated
this
man
and
that
he
inspired
her
with
fear
and
horror
across
a
long
expanse
of
he
conducted
her
to
the
ancient
marriage
throne
upon
its
platform
surmounted
by
a
pompous
crown
from
which
old
embroidered
silks
hung
heavily
then
with
an
unheard
phrase
and
another
bow
he
left
her
to
the
ordeal
of
the
reception
while
he
withdrew
to
his
own
entertainment
at
her
father
house
she
would
not
see
him
again
until
night
when
he
would
pay
her
a
call
of
ceremony
she
saw
his
figure
hesitating
a
moment
as
he
faced
the
oncoming
guests
such
a
flood
of
femininity
unmantled
now
and
unveiled
sparkling
in
rainbow
hues
of
silks
and
tulle
and
gauze
that
he
had
never
before
faced
and
never
would
again
like
a
bright
wave
the
throng
closed
about
him
and
then
surged
on
towards
the
bride
upon
the
throne
how
often
in
the
last
years
aimée
had
pitied
that
poor
puppet
of
a
bride
stuck
there
like
some
impaled
winged
creature
helpless
for
flight
to
the
exhibition
of
the
long
stream
of
passersby
how
often
she
had
promised
herself
that
never
would
this
be
her
fate
never
would
she
be
given
to
an
unknown
and
now
she
was
smiling
as
she
faced
them
that
light
fixed
smile
she
had
seen
so
often
on
others
lips
the
smile
of
pride
trying
desperately
to
hide
its
wounds
from
the
penetrating
glances
of
the
curious
satiric
cynical
or
sympathetic
that
light
smile
defied
them
all
but
beneath
its
guard
she
felt
she
was
slowly
bleeding
to
death
of
some
mortal
hurt
the
sympathy
unconsciously
betrayed
was
hardest
the
whispers
of
her
young
maids
of
honor
really
aimée
he
looks
so
young
one
would
never
surmise
were
more
galling
in
their
intended
consolation
more
revealing
in
their
betrayal
of
her
friends
own
shrinking
from
that
arrogant
dandified
old
man
than
the
barbed
dart
of
the
uncaring
inquisitive
how
do
you
find
him
my
dear
he
has
the
reputation
for
conquest
they
were
all
there
her
friends
young
slim
modish
turkish
girls
whose
time
had
not
yet
come
glancing
quizzically
about
the
ancient
drawing
room
with
its
solid
side
of
mashrubiyeh
its
old
wall
panelings
of
carvings
and
rare
inlay
and
then
pointing
their
glances
back
at
her
as
if
to
ask
and
is
this
our
revoltée
is
this
her
end
in
this
dim
old
palace
among
the
ghosts
of
the
past
some
the
frankest
murmured
but
why
did
you
not
refuse
and
others
attempted
consolation
with
a
light
as
well
the
first
as
the
last
since
we
must
all
come
to
it
of
the
married
women
there
were
those
who
raised
blank
bitter
eyes
to
her
and
others
more
mild
romantic
affectionate
tried
to
infuse
encouragement
into
their
smiles
as
if
they
said
come
courage
it
not
so
bad
and
what
would
you
we
are
women
after
all
we
do
not
need
so
much
for
happiness
those
dreams
of
yours
for
love
for
a
spirit
to
delight
in
your
spirit
in
place
of
a
master
delighting
in
your
beauty
alone
what
are
they
those
dreams
but
the
childish
stuff
of
fancies
for
other
races
perhaps
but
for
you
take
hold
of
life
there
are
realities
yet
in
it
to
bring
you
joy
it
was
all
in
their
eyes
their
voices
their
intonations
their
pressure
of
her
hands
and
she
stood
there
among
them
all
smiling
always
that
smile
demanded
of
the
bride
looking
unseeingly
into
their
eyes
listening
unhearingly
to
the
sea
of
voices
breaking
on
her
ears
responding
in
vague
monosyllables
and
a
wider
smile
while
all
the
time
her
eyes
saw
only
that
face
that
smirking
cynical
old
face
and
the
tide
of
terror
rose
higher
and
higher
in
her
soul
never
had
she
given
way
to
her
fear
never
since
the
black
night
when
she
found
the
key
was
gone
then
after
frenzied
searching
in
impossible
places
she
had
stolen
back
to
her
room
and
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
to
stifle
the
breaking
sobs
of
rebellion
and
despair
and
of
a
longing
so
deep
and
so
terrible
that
it
seemed
to
rend
her
with
a
physical
anguish
a
pain
so
fiery
that
her
heart
would
forever
bear
the
scar
never
again
would
she
see
him
now
never
would
she
know
never
would
she
know
all
she
had
refused
his
aid
and
he
might
believe
her
still
aloof
incredulous
it
was
finished
forever
and
ever
she
had
told
herself
that
before
but
always
there
had
been
the
key
and
now
there
was
no
key
and
no
escape
and
her
heart
broke
itself
against
the
iron
of
necessity
she
had
cried
the
night
through
morning
had
brought
her
exhaustion
not
peace
but
a
despairing
submission
why
struggle
when
the
prison
gate
is
shut
and
if
there
was
never
to
be
freedom
for
her
never
again
the
sight
of
that
face
and
the
sound
of
that
voice
why
then
as
well
one
fate
as
another
and
it
was
too
late
now
to
recede
so
she
had
called
upon
her
pride
and
summoned
her
spirit
to
play
its
part
to
protect
her
from
whispers
and
surmise
and
pity
she
would
surrender
to
this
man
because
she
must
and
she
would
win
his
respect
by
her
dignity
and
worth
but
her
soul
she
would
keep
its
own
in
its
unsullied
dreams
and
in
its
memories
life
would
be
nothing
but
a
hardship
nobly
borne
but
now
she
had
seen
the
man
now
this
wild
dislike
this
sickening
terror
to
be
alone
with
him
to
have
only
the
few
days
grace
of
courtship
which
the
mohammadan
custom
imposes
upon
the
bridegroom
to
be
forever
at
his
mercy
in
this
solitary
palace
with
its
echoing
corridors
its
blackened
walla
its
damp
breath
of
age
she
thought
wildly
of
death
and
all
the
time
she
was
smiling
bending
her
cheek
to
the
kiss
of
a
friend
feeling
the
fingers
of
some
press
upon
her
listening
to
praises
of
her
beauty
for
she
was
beautiful
no
image
of
wax
now
the
scarlet
of
her
frightened
blood
was
staining
her
cheeks
her
eyes
were
bright
as
the
jewels
in
her
diadem
and
beneath
the
veil
her
dark
hair
revealed
its
lovely
wealth
is
she
not
a
rose
will
he
not
adore
her
our
hamdi
she
heard
that
stout
cousin
of
hamdi
say
to
a
companion
and
the
two
stared
on
appraisingly
at
the
young
girl
in
her
freshness
and
virginal
youth
as
if
at
some
toy
to
invite
the
jaded
appetite
of
a
satiated
master
and
still
the
throng
filed
by
a
strange
throng
beneath
the
flickering
light
and
shadow
of
the
mashrubiyeh
slender
young
turks
or
blonde
circassians
in
their
paris
frocks
their
eyes
tormented
or
malicious
and
here
and
there
like
a
green
island
of
calm
some
rotund
matron
grave
and
serene
her
head
encircled
with
an
old
fashioned
turban
of
gauze
her
stout
flesh
encased
in
heavy
silks
bought
at
damask
so
as
not
to
enrich
the
unbelievers
at
lyons
and
then
the
spectacle
changed
the
black
street
mantles
appeared
yashmaks
and
tcharchafs
for
now
the
doors
were
opened
to
all
the
feminine
world
and
there
came
strange
unknown
women
slipping
out
from
their
grills
for
this
pleasuring
in
a
palace
often
draped
and
turbaned
in
the
fashion
of
some
far
province
of
their
youth
women
incredibly
fat
in
rich
stuffs
of
asia
their
bright
eyes
spying
delightedly
upon
the
scene
or
furtive
poor
women
keeping
courage
in
twos
and
threes
now
too
at
four
came
the
women
from
the
embassies
a
russian
girl
with
whom
aimée
had
played
tennis
in
ages
past
rosy
now
with
yesterday
sun
and
sleepy
with
last
night
dance
who
touched
the
bride
hand
as
if
it
were
the
hand
of
one
already
consigned
to
the
tomb
other
girls
she
did
not
know
who
stared
at
her
with
the
avid
eyes
of
their
young
curiosities
older
women
experienced
unstirred
drinking
their
tea
and
smoking
cigarettes
and
gossiping
of
their
own
affairs
and
occasionally
among
them
a
tourist
agog
with
wonder
and
exultation
storing
away
details
for
a
lifetime
of
talk
asking
amiably
the
most
incredible
questions
and
is
it
true
you
have
never
met
your
husband
listen
jane
she
says
she
has
never
met
him
a
girl
in
a
creamy
white
silk
came
forward
a
little
uncertainly
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
a
curve
of
ruddy
hair
visible
under
her
smart
straw
and
very
bright
eyes
where
shyness
was
at
variance
with
a
friendly
smile
indeed
jinny
jeffries
was
extraordinarily
intimidated
by
the
occasion
she
had
a
distinct
sense
of
intrusion
mingling
with
her
delight
at
having
intruded
and
she
murmured
her
good
wishes
in
an
almost
inaudible
tone
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
let
us
come
i
wish
you
every
happiness
she
said
beside
her
a
tall
slender
figure
in
black
tcharchaf
and
yashmak
made
its
appearance
aimée
eyes
slipped
past
the
pretty
american
the
mechanical
smile
was
frozen
on
her
lips
over
the
black
veil
she
saw
the
hazel
eyes
bright
with
excitement
vivid
as
speech
the
eyes
of
the
masquerader
in
the
scotch
costume
the
eyes
of
the
man
at
the
garden
gate
jack
ryder
eyes
the
eyes
of
her
dreams
chapter
xi
the
forty
doors
when
ryder
had
despatched
from
the
jeweler
who
had
polished
the
locket
for
him
that
package
with
its
secret
note
and
its
warning
plaid
he
had
no
real
assurance
that
the
message
would
fall
into
aimée
hands
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
and
he
argued
very
favorably
for
his
stratagem
that
miniature
should
have
some
effect
and
given
the
miniature
and
the
bit
of
plaid
cloth
aimée
quick
wit
ought
to
divine
a
message
she
had
always
the
key
he
remembered
and
the
power
of
egress
from
her
prison
and
surely
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
for
her
to
devise
some
way
of
getting
a
letter
into
the
post
so
his
hope
fluctuated
between
the
garden
gate
and
the
daily
mail
at
the
bank
and
he
rather
surprised
mclean
by
the
frequency
and
brevity
of
his
visits
and
by
the
duration
of
his
stay
in
cairo
for
that
he
had
an
excuse
both
to
mclean
and
to
the
deserted
thatcher
at
the
excavation
camp
two
excuses
in
fact
some
belated
identification
work
to
be
done
at
the
museum
and
a
cracked
wisdom
tooth
chiefly
he
spoke
of
the
necessity
for
dentistry
and
accounted
for
his
moods
with
his
molar
of
moods
he
had
many
moods
when
he
contemplated
his
behavior
lightly
and
brightly
or
darkly
in
unrelieved
disgust
moods
when
he
refused
to
contemplate
it
at
all
but
he
stayed
that
was
the
conspicuous
and
enduring
thing
he
stayed
jinny
jeffries
returned
from
the
nile
by
express
to
find
him
ensconced
at
her
hotel
and
her
bright
confidence
suffered
no
diminution
of
its
self
respect
and
it
was
through
jinny
that
chance
set
another
straw
of
circumstance
dancing
his
way
jinny
had
a
frock
she
wished
repaired
whom
she
had
met
upon
the
nile
recommended
to
her
a
hendricks
wife
of
a
british
soldier
and
a
most
clever
little
needle
woman
jinny
looked
up
hendricks
and
found
it
impossible
to
secure
her
for
some
days
as
she
was
busy
refitting
for
a
fashionable
wedding
in
the
mohammedan
world
a
night
later
and
two
nights
before
the
wedding
jinny
made
a
narrative
of
the
circumstances
for
jack
ryder
benefit
such
frocks
to
do
and
the
young
lady
no
more
caring
had
been
a
saying
of
the
hendricks
that
jinny
passed
interestedly
on
to
jack
she
had
no
memory
of
the
young
lady
name
but
distinctly
she
recalled
that
she
was
young
and
beautiful
and
to
marry
a
general
it
was
enough
to
launch
jinny
eager
interest
in
mohammedan
marriages
and
foster
the
wish
that
she
might
attend
one
she
regretted
absence
and
her
lack
of
acquaintance
and
suggested
that
jack
ought
to
know
some
one
better
than
that
take
you
said
jack
with
a
promptness
that
brought
a
light
to
miss
jeffries
eyes
there
was
also
a
light
in
jack
ryder
eyes
a
swift
burning
of
excitement
and
adventure
why
not
the
thing
was
possible
muffled
in
a
tcharchaf
and
veiled
with
a
heavy
yashmak
armed
with
enough
arabic
for
the
briefest
of
encounters
he
might
dare
the
danger
who
in
the
world
would
discover
him
who
would
ever
know
the
thing
was
unthinkable
it
was
a
desperate
desecration
comparable
only
in
his
vague
analogies
to
the
mecca
pilgrimage
and
profanation
of
a
holy
tomb
but
its
very
improbability
would
prevent
detection
only
jinny
had
to
keep
her
mouth
extremely
shut
before
and
afterwards
he
impressed
this
upon
her
so
thoroughly
as
they
did
their
shopping
for
the
costume
together
the
next
morning
that
she
had
compunctious
moments
of
solicitude
when
she
said
he
really
ought
not
to
she
would
feel
responsible
thereupon
he
laughed
and
dared
her
to
be
game
and
she
grew
all
mirthful
confidence
again
but
that
night
sitting
alone
in
a
native
café
over
his
turkish
coffee
ryder
was
grimly
serious
he
knew
that
it
was
a
mad
thing
to
do
he
felt
not
so
much
the
danger
he
ran
from
discovery
but
the
danger
to
his
already
shattered
peace
of
mind
from
another
glimpse
of
that
strange
girl
that
young
unknown
on
whom
he
had
spent
such
time
and
thought
of
late
that
she
seemed
a
very
part
of
his
existence
what
was
the
good
of
going
to
her
wedding
reception
feebly
he
told
himself
that
it
was
his
only
chance
to
inform
her
upon
the
history
of
the
delcassés
there
might
have
been
reasons
for
her
at
the
gate
for
her
not
writing
he
could
have
no
glimmering
of
what
went
on
behind
those
barred
windows
this
was
his
only
chance
he
meant
to
say
to
tell
her
but
his
eager
senses
murmured
to
see
her
again
that
was
it
to
see
her
again
he
owned
the
lure
at
last
with
a
bitter
ruefulness
but
he
brightened
up
at
that
it
was
partly
his
duty
to
himself
now
he
had
all
sorts
of
fool
imaginings
about
this
girl
he
was
remembering
her
as
something
lovelier
than
a
houri
more
enchanting
than
fairy
magic
more
sweet
than
spring
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
rout
these
imbecile
prepossessions
and
prove
clearly
and
dispassionately
that
the
girl
was
just
a
very
nice
little
girl
a
pretty
bride
marrying
into
a
very
distinct
life
from
his
own
and
a
girl
with
whom
he
would
not
have
an
idea
in
common
a
girl
in
fact
far
inferior
to
any
american
a
girl
not
to
be
compared
to
jinny
jeffries
besides
there
was
fun
in
the
thing
it
tempted
him
tremendously
it
was
adventurous
romantic
forbidden
he
heard
the
word
echoed
in
turkish
behind
him
so
engrossed
in
his
thoughts
had
he
been
that
he
had
been
inattentive
to
the
rhythm
of
old
khazib
the
tale
teller
voice
as
he
held
forth
from
the
divan
beside
his
pipe
to
his
nightly
audience
of
men
and
boys
camel
drivers
small
merchants
desert
men
from
the
long
caravans
who
were
the
frequenters
of
this
café
there
were
few
about
the
old
man
and
ryder
had
small
difficulty
in
drawing
nearer
the
circle
a
arab
with
the
profile
of
a
washington
and
the
naïve
eyes
of
youth
whispered
to
him
courteously
that
it
was
the
tale
of
the
third
kaland
and
the
prince
azib
was
in
the
palace
of
the
forty
damsels
who
were
farewelling
him
as
they
were
to
depart
according
to
custom
for
forty
days
khazib
with
a
faint
salutation
of
his
turban
towards
the
newcomer
went
slowly
sonorously
on
with
his
tale
we
fear
said
the
damsel
unto
azib
lest
thou
contraire
our
charge
and
disobey
our
injunctions
here
now
we
commit
to
thee
the
keys
of
the
palace
which
containeth
forty
chambers
and
thou
mayest
open
of
these
thirty
and
nine
but
beware
and
we
conjure
thee
by
allah
and
by
the
lives
of
us
lest
thou
open
the
fortieth
door
for
therein
is
that
which
shall
separate
us
forever
for
a
moment
the
café
faded
from
ryder
eyes
he
was
in
the
gloom
of
a
garden
a
shadowy
darkness
just
touched
by
a
crescent
moon
and
beside
him
in
the
shrubbery
a
form
shaking
its
shawled
head
at
him
in
denial
and
whispering
lightly
but
tremblingly
it
is
a
forbidden
door
forbidden
as
that
fortieth
there
are
thirty
and
nine
doors
in
your
life
monsieur
that
you
may
open
but
this
is
the
forbidden
he
had
meant
to
look
up
that
tale
and
now
chance
was
reminding
him
of
it
again
a
superstitious
man
ryder
great
grandfather
perhaps
would
have
felt
it
an
omen
of
warning
and
a
devout
man
ryder
grandfather
perhaps
would
have
taken
it
for
a
sign
from
heaven
to
divert
his
steps
ryder
reflected
upon
coincidence
when
i
saw
her
weeping
khazib
was
intoning
and
now
ryder
attended
his
scanty
knowledge
of
the
vernacular
straining
and
overleaping
the
blanks
prince
azib
said
to
himself
allah
i
will
never
open
that
fortieth
door
never
and
in
no
wise
a
wise
bird
thought
ryder
to
himself
drawing
on
his
cigarette
and
i
bade
her
farewell
continued
the
voice
slipping
into
the
first
person
thereupon
all
departed
flying
like
birds
leaving
me
alone
in
the
palace
when
evening
drew
near
i
opened
the
door
of
the
first
chamber
and
found
myself
in
a
place
like
one
of
the
pleasances
of
paradise
it
was
a
garden
with
trees
of
freshest
green
and
ripe
fruits
of
yellow
sheen
and
i
walked
among
the
trees
and
i
smelt
the
breath
of
the
flowers
and
heard
the
birds
sing
their
praise
to
allah
the
one
the
almighty
murmured
ryder
neighbors
reverently
and
i
looked
upon
the
apple
whose
hue
is
parcel
red
and
parcel
yellow
and
i
looked
upon
the
quince
whose
fragrance
putteth
to
shame
musk
and
ambergris
and
upon
the
pear
whose
taste
surpasseth
sherbet
and
sugar
and
the
apricot
whose
beauty
striketh
the
eye
as
she
were
a
polished
ruby
on
the
morrow
i
opened
the
second
door
and
found
myself
in
a
spacious
plain
set
with
tall
date
palms
and
watered
by
a
running
stream
whose
banks
were
shrubbed
with
rose
and
jasmine
while
privet
and
eglantine
violet
and
lily
narcissus
origane
and
the
winter
gilliflower
carpeted
the
borders
and
the
breath
of
the
breeze
swept
over
those
growths
how
inadequate
ryder
realized
had
been
the
description
given
by
the
book
of
genesis
to
the
garden
of
eden
and
the
third
door
droned
on
the
rhythmic
voice
into
an
open
hall
hung
with
cages
of
and
full
of
birds
which
made
sweet
music
such
as
the
mocking
bird
and
the
cusha
the
merle
the
turtle
dove
and
the
nubian
a
trifle
restively
ryder
stirred
he
liked
birds
but
he
wanted
to
be
getting
on
to
that
fortieth
door
and
this
was
slow
progress
not
a
sign
of
impatience
marred
the
bright
absorbed
content
of
the
other
listeners
intent
now
upon
the
wonders
behind
that
the
fourth
chamber
revealed
stores
of
pearls
and
jacinths
and
beryls
and
emeralds
and
corals
and
carbuncles
and
all
manner
of
precious
gems
and
jewels
such
as
the
tongue
of
man
could
not
describe
the
story
teller
proceeded
then
quoth
prince
azib
now
verily
am
i
the
monarch
of
the
age
since
by
allah
grace
this
enormous
wealth
is
mine
and
i
have
forty
damsels
under
my
hand
nor
is
there
any
to
claim
them
save
myself
the
handsome
arab
beside
ryder
inhaled
his
pipe
luxuriously
by
the
grace
of
allah
he
said
reverently
then
i
gave
not
over
opening
place
after
place
until
nine
and
thirty
days
were
passed
and
in
that
time
i
had
entered
every
chamber
except
that
one
whose
door
i
was
charged
not
to
open
but
my
thoughts
ever
ran
upon
that
forbidden
fortieth
and
satan
urged
me
to
open
it
for
my
own
undoing
i
see
his
finish
said
ryder
interestedly
to
himself
and
he
thought
of
the
analogy
so
i
stood
before
the
chamber
and
after
a
few
moments
hesitation
opened
the
door
which
was
plated
with
red
gold
and
entered
i
was
met
by
a
perfume
whose
like
i
had
never
before
smelt
and
so
sharp
and
subtle
was
the
odor
that
it
made
my
senses
drunken
as
with
strong
wine
and
i
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
fainting
fit
which
lasted
a
full
hour
when
i
came
to
myself
i
strengthened
my
heart
and
entering
found
myself
in
a
chamber
bespread
with
saffron
and
blazing
with
light
presently
i
spied
a
noble
steed
black
as
the
murks
of
night
when
murkiest
standing
ready
saddled
and
bridled
and
his
saddle
was
of
red
gold
before
two
mangers
one
of
clear
crystal
wherein
was
husked
sesame
and
the
other
also
of
crystal
containing
water
of
the
rose
scented
with
musk
when
i
saw
this
i
marveled
and
said
to
myself
in
this
animal
must
be
some
wondrous
mystery
and
satan
satan
the
stoned
murmured
ryder
neighbor
religiously
satan
cozened
me
so
i
led
him
without
and
mounted
him
and
struck
him
withal
when
he
felt
the
blow
he
neighed
a
neigh
with
a
sound
like
deafening
thunder
and
opening
a
pair
of
wings
flew
up
with
me
in
the
firmament
of
heaven
far
beyond
the
eyesight
of
man
after
a
full
hour
of
flight
he
descended
and
shaking
me
off
his
back
lashed
me
on
the
face
with
his
tail
and
gouged
out
my
left
eye
causing
it
to
roll
along
my
cheek
then
he
flew
away
on
rolled
the
voice
narrating
the
prince
descent
to
the
table
of
the
other
youths
but
ryder
was
unheeding
and
at
the
close
he
inclined
his
head
with
the
other
listeners
murmuring
may
allah
increase
thy
prosperity
as
he
felt
in
his
pockets
for
the
silver
which
the
others
were
drawing
from
turban
and
sleeves
and
sash
to
lay
in
the
patriarch
lap
and
then
raised
his
head
to
question
diffidently
would
you
interpret
o
khazib
the
meaning
of
that
door
for
i
hear
that
it
hath
now
become
a
saying
of
a
forbidden
thing
the
sage
hesitated
sucking
at
his
pipe
then
he
said
slowly
to
every
man
o
youth
is
there
a
forbidden
door
beyond
which
waits
the
steed
of
high
adventure
with
wings
beyond
man
riding
and
so
the
rider
is
lost
and
his
vision
is
gone
but
for
him
who
could
ride
ryder
suggested
inshallah
who
can
say
till
he
has
tried
his
destiny
and
better
are
the
nine
and
thirty
chambers
of
safe
pleasance
than
the
lonely
sightlessness
of
the
outcast
one
it
is
a
tale
which
if
it
were
written
upon
the
with
were
a
warning
to
those
who
would
be
warned
for
a
moment
their
eyes
held
each
other
smiling
but
grave
thoughts
were
of
the
morrow
of
that
forbidden
entry
he
was
planning
to
make
of
the
risks
the
wild
uncertainties
wisdom
and
counsel
looked
significantly
out
at
him
out
of
those
patriarchal
eyes
prudence
and
sanity
clamored
within
him
for
a
hearing
and
then
he
smiled
the
whimsical
boyish
smile
of
young
adventuring
but
whoever
o
my
father
had
opened
that
forbidden
door
the
veriest
crack
and
breathed
its
scent
and
glimpsed
its
dazzlement
then
for
him
there
is
no
turning
back
he
confided
he
rose
and
khazib
eyes
followed
him
luck
go
with
you
my
son
he
said
clearly
in
allah
name
and
smiling
in
faint
ruefulness
may
allah
heed
thee
ryder
murmured
piously
chapter
xii
the
uninvited
guest
now
as
he
stood
before
aimée
and
saw
her
eyes
widen
with
recognition
he
knew
that
he
would
have
need
of
all
his
luck
and
all
his
wit
he
stepped
hastily
forward
glory
to
god
that
he
has
permitted
me
to
behold
you
this
day
he
murmured
in
the
studiously
arabic
that
might
be
expected
from
a
humble
turkish
woman
in
plain
mantle
and
yashmak
may
allah
continue
to
spread
before
thee
the
carpet
of
enjoyment
and
then
lower
almost
muffled
by
the
thick
veil
can
you
give
me
a
moment
eagerly
significantly
his
eyes
met
hers
half
fearfully
aimée
flashed
an
excited
look
around
her
the
space
before
the
marriage
throne
had
thinned
for
there
were
no
more
arrivals
waiting
to
offer
their
congratulations
and
the
guests
were
clustering
now
about
the
tables
for
refreshment
or
drifting
into
the
next
salon
where
behind
firmly
stretched
silken
walls
a
stringed
orchestra
was
playing
miss
jeffries
alone
was
lingering
near
but
she
moved
off
now
at
a
secret
look
from
ryder
with
an
appearance
of
unconcern
i
am
going
to
try
my
vernacular
on
the
bride
ryder
had
told
her
do
linger
or
look
alarmed
i
wo
give
the
show
away
so
there
was
no
one
to
overhear
a
colloquy
between
the
bride
and
the
veiled
woman
no
one
to
note
or
wonder
that
the
veiled
woman
was
speaking
strangely
enough
in
rapid
english
when
i
did
hear
from
you
i
had
to
come
to
know
if
you
received
the
package
and
letter
i
sent
with
a
swift
gesture
of
her
little
ringed
hand
aimée
drew
from
the
laces
on
her
bosom
that
heavy
gold
locket
indeed
i
have
it
and
the
note
too
i
found
but
i
could
not
write
you
there
was
no
way
no
one
to
trust
to
mail
it
and
they
had
stolen
my
key
she
whispered
and
the
confessing
words
with
their
quiver
of
forlornness
told
ryder
something
of
the
story
of
those
helpless
days
and
nights
he
murmured
i
did
dare
write
you
more
personally
for
fear
they
would
find
the
note
i
understood
that
plaid
about
the
box
that
was
so
clever
a
warning
i
kept
the
box
and
hunted
in
it
i
wanted
to
tell
you
more
about
that
locket
i
dug
it
up
myself
from
the
tomb
i
was
excavating
do
you
remember
how
you
wished
that
i
would
dig
from
the
sands
whatever
secret
i
most
desired
and
i
found
that
and
it
happened
that
at
mclean
i
had
met
the
french
agent
who
was
searching
for
any
trace
of
the
delcassés
of
the
wife
and
child
of
the
explorer
who
had
disappeared
fifteen
years
before
that
miniature
was
your
image
and
i
guessed
at
once
mclean
and
i
went
to
the
pasha
oh
i
did
tell
him
i
met
you
he
flung
in
his
eyes
twinkling
and
we
pretended
we
knew
all
about
his
marriage
to
madame
delcassé
and
he
owned
up
without
a
quiver
but
when
we
tried
to
claim
you
for
the
french
family
he
doubled
like
a
hare
he
said
the
delcassé
child
was
dead
died
when
his
own
child
was
a
baby
and
that
you
were
his
own
but
i
was
sure
that
you
were
more
than
fourteen
and
that
he
was
simply
putting
it
over
on
us
so
as
to
have
this
marriage
go
on
without
interference
and
so
i
tried
to
get
the
story
to
you
even
now
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
he
added
as
if
in
palliation
of
his
invasion
here
for
he
realized
now
how
tremendous
an
invasion
it
was
all
the
guests
about
him
had
not
given
him
that
feeling
all
that
sea
of
femininity
those
grave
matrons
whose
serenely
unveiled
faces
would
burn
with
shame
to
be
beheld
by
this
stranger
those
bright
slim
girls
in
their
extravagant
frocks
their
tulle
their
lace
their
pearls
their
diamonds
all
the
hidden
charms
that
no
man
had
yet
seen
stirred
in
him
no
more
than
an
excited
and
adventurous
curiosity
but
the
vision
of
aimée
that
delicate
beauty
in
its
tragic
irony
of
throne
and
diadem
it
touched
him
to
tenderness
and
to
an
actual
sense
of
sacrilege
at
the
freedom
of
his
gaze
no
moonlight
vision
this
ethereal
and
but
a
vivid
disquieting
radiance
of
dark
shining
eyes
and
cheeks
he
had
never
seen
her
hair
before
midnight
hair
escaping
little
curls
from
the
veil
and
the
diadem
and
he
had
never
really
seen
her
mouth
wistful
and
gay
like
the
mouth
of
the
miniature
nor
her
chin
so
tender
and
willful
nor
her
skin
in
its
veiling
from
the
daylight
she
was
more
than
young
and
sweet
and
fair
she
was
beauty
beauty
with
its
elusive
ineluctable
spell
entangled
with
the
appeal
of
her
helplessness
a
bright
blush
flooded
her
now
and
her
eyes
fell
in
confusion
before
the
prolonging
of
his
look
but
it
is
dangerous
your
being
here
she
murmured
the
fortieth
door
he
reminded
her
under
her
breath
ah
you
remember
i
remember
and
but
last
night
i
heard
khazib
the
story
teller
tell
the
tale
and
i
thought
of
you
and
your
warning
of
the
door
that
hid
you
that
it
was
forbidden
for
me
to
open
and
so
you
opened
it
monsieur
faintly
she
smiled
with
downcast
lashes
and
i
came
as
you
first
came
to
me
in
mantle
and
veil
for
a
moment
their
thoughts
fled
back
to
that
masquerade
which
seemed
so
long
ago
but
it
is
too
late
she
said
tremulously
it
too
late
for
me
to
help
you
at
that
her
eyes
rose
to
his
again
in
a
swift
flash
of
hunted
fear
oh
take
me
away
from
him
she
breathed
suddenly
unpremeditately
somehow
somewhere
another
figure
came
towards
them
madame
de
coulevain
in
all
her
severe
elegance
of
black
come
and
join
your
friends
at
the
supper
my
dear
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
be
pilloried
here
any
longer
she
observed
with
an
indifferent
scrutiny
of
the
persistent
veiled
woman
and
ryder
moved
slowly
away
while
aimée
came
dutifully
down
from
the
throne
a
huge
black
bending
to
hold
her
train
i
thought
you
were
coming
what
you
talking
about
demanded
a
voice
in
ryder
ear
and
he
found
jinny
jeffries
at
his
side
her
bright
gray
eyes
pouncing
upon
him
with
curiosity
oh
i
wished
her
joy
native
phrases
that
sort
of
thing
he
answered
mechanically
as
they
drew
back
into
an
embrasure
of
the
mashrubiyeh
that
formed
one
side
of
the
great
room
but
you
were
talking
forever
i
saw
you
holding
forth
at
a
tremendous
rate
why
would
you
let
me
stay
and
listen
you
have
put
me
off
my
shot
i
had
to
feel
unobserved
to
play
up
you
must
be
fearfully
good
at
arabic
said
jinny
guilelessly
and
what
did
she
say
why
she
did
say
anything
in
particular
but
what
was
that
she
was
showing
you
i
saw
her
bend
forward
with
a
locket
or
something
a
plague
upon
jinny
bright
eyes
oh
yes
the
locket
said
ryder
with
an
effort
she
ah
she
showed
it
to
me
but
was
that
awfully
funny
oh
i
believe
it
a
custom
courtesy
stunt
you
know
to
show
a
poor
guest
some
of
the
presents
he
explained
manufacturing
under
pressure
i
wish
she
show
her
rings
did
you
ever
see
so
many
it
was
the
only
thing
about
her
you
call
really
eastern
all
those
glittering
diamonds
on
her
fingers
and
did
you
notice
her
hands
jinny
went
on
enthusiastically
jack
i
never
knew
there
was
anything
so
lovely
as
that
girl
in
the
world
she
simply
i
suppose
it
her
whole
life
miss
jeffries
reflected
keeping
herself
beautiful
her
eyes
rested
curiously
on
the
feminine
groups
before
them
they
have
anything
else
to
do
or
think
about
have
they
i
understand
some
of
them
are
remarkably
educated
young
women
what
the
use
of
it
said
the
practical
daughter
of
an
american
college
they
ca
ever
meet
any
men
but
just
a
husband
they
can
read
for
themselves
ca
they
and
talk
to
each
other
and
well
what
do
you
girls
do
with
your
education
anyway
you
do
lug
anything
very
heavy
about
the
golf
course
and
the
ball
room
who
wants
us
to
but
we
do
bring
something
to
committees
and
clubs
and
and
welfare
work
miss
jeffries
maintained
stoutly
and
we
are
always
into
arguments
at
dinners
while
these
girls
they
dine
out
they
have
anybody
but
themselves
to
argue
with
and
it
does
matter
a
straw
politically
what
they
think
they
ca
even
change
the
customs
that
their
great
great
great
grandfathers
imposed
if
i
were
one
of
these
girls
she
declared
positively
i
bother
about
kant
and
chemistry
and
history
i
stuff
myself
full
of
sweetmeats
and
loll
around
on
a
divan
and
not
care
what
happened
outside
or
else
i
be
miserable
perhaps
they
are
miserable
they
ought
to
fight
think
said
jinny
dramatically
of
marrying
some
man
you
never
seen
the
way
that
lovely
girl
is
doing
suppose
she
does
like
him
suppose
he
dull
and
cranky
and
mean
and
greedy
suppose
he
bores
her
suppose
she
actually
hates
him
why
jack
it
horrible
and
yet
she
submits
she
to
it
suppose
she
has
to
submit
that
she
has
a
soul
on
earth
to
help
her
how
would
you
fight
i
wonder
well
you
do
need
to
shout
about
it
that
woman
looking
now
that
one
with
the
green
turban
and
the
eyes
nervously
jinny
glanced
around
it
a
fearful
lark
she
murmured
but
i
do
believe
i
ever
have
had
the
nerve
if
i
realized
what
do
you
suppose
they
would
jack
if
they
found
you
out
those
big
blacks
look
so
so
uncivilized
her
eyes
rested
upon
the
huge
eunuch
at
the
far
entrance
of
the
salon
a
huge
hideous
fellow
with
red
fez
baggy
blouse
and
trousers
and
a
knife
handle
sticking
piratically
from
a
sash
he
has
on
english
oxfords
said
ryder
lightly
that
a
saving
something
but
they
are
going
to
find
out
i
have
an
idea
we
ought
to
make
our
getaway
now
and
that
we
had
better
not
go
together
you
go
first
and
then
i
stroll
along
and
whisk
off
these
duds
in
some
quiet
corner
i
have
to
meet
a
man
but
i
probably
see
you
and
he
entreated
do
as
you
love
your
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
breathe
a
word
of
my
being
here
like
this
to
any
one
any
time
anywhere
i
was
an
unmitigated
ass
to
link
you
up
with
it
so
be
wary
oh
i
shall
jinny
jeffries
promised
vividly
and
with
a
last
look
about
the
old
palace
the
empty
marriage
throne
and
the
dissolving
knots
of
guests
she
gave
a
little
nod
to
her
veiled
companion
sauntered
without
visible
trepidation
past
the
staring
eunuch
at
the
door
went
down
the
long
stairs
where
other
departing
guests
were
drawing
on
mantles
and
veils
and
so
made
her
way
across
a
shadowy
garden
and
out
the
gate
that
another
black
opened
and
then
she
drew
a
sudden
breath
of
relief
and
glanced
up
at
a
sky
of
sunset
fires
and
felt
the
free
airs
play
with
her
hair
and
face
and
so
shook
off
lightly
and
gratefully
that
darkening
impression
of
shuttered
rooms
and
guarding
blacks
little
rivers
of
wine
and
fire
were
bubbling
in
aimée
veins
she
was
gay
at
supper
as
a
bride
should
be
gay
it
was
enough
for
those
first
few
moments
that
she
had
seen
him
again
that
he
had
dared
to
come
and
try
to
help
her
that
he
cared
enough
to
come
her
heart
sang
little
pæans
of
joy
and
triumph
she
sketched
impossible
scenes
of
escape
she
saw
herself
in
a
shrouding
mantle
slipping
with
him
past
the
guests
at
the
door
she
saw
them
speeding
away
in
a
motor
she
saw
france
the
unknown
delcassés
a
bright
gay
world
of
freedom
and
romance
or
perhaps
if
not
then
they
would
plan
she
would
obtain
permission
to
take
a
drive
and
there
would
be
a
signal
a
waiting
car
but
better
now
she
could
not
endure
even
the
call
of
ceremony
from
that
man
who
called
himself
her
husband
the
very
memory
of
his
eyes
on
her
decidedly
it
must
be
and
ryder
would
think
of
a
way
she
must
get
back
to
him
he
would
be
lingering
she
must
get
away
from
this
hateful
table
these
guests
and
companions
a
wild
impatience
tore
at
her
she
grew
uneasy
anxious
fretted
at
the
frightening
way
that
time
was
slipping
past
her
radiance
vanished
her
smile
was
nervous
forced
as
she
sat
at
her
table
of
honor
amid
the
circle
of
her
friends
with
a
linked
wreath
of
candelabra
sending
its
sparkle
of
lights
over
the
young
faces
and
throats
over
the
glittering
silver
on
the
white
satin
cloth
among
the
drift
of
pink
and
white
rose
petals
she
began
to
bite
her
lips
nervously
she
did
not
hear
what
her
bridesmaids
were
chattering
about
her
eyes
went
often
with
that
stealth
that
invites
regard
to
the
tiny
platinum
and
diamond
watch
upon
her
wrist
would
they
never
finish
would
they
never
be
free
she
wondered
if
she
dared
feign
an
illness
to
rise
and
leave
them
but
no
that
would
mean
solicitude
companions
and
now
the
slaves
were
bringing
still
another
round
of
trays
oh
hurry
hurry
her
tightening
nerves
besought
at
last
the
older
women
were
going
not
even
for
a
wedding
would
they
deeply
infringe
upon
that
rule
which
keeps
the
moslem
women
indoors
after
the
sun
has
set
ceremoniously
each
made
to
the
bride
her
adieux
and
good
wishes
and
ceremoniously
a
frantically
impatient
aimée
returned
the
formal
thanks
due
for
assistance
at
the
humble
fête
she
did
not
see
that
black
mantle
anywhere
her
heart
sank
stupid
she
told
herself
with
quivering
lips
to
dream
that
he
could
dare
to
linger
that
he
had
any
way
to
get
her
out
by
help
he
meant
no
more
than
getting
letters
to
france
for
her
and
yet
his
eyes
when
they
had
met
hers
surely
he
had
meant
but
when
she
had
disappeared
from
the
reception
room
to
attend
the
supper
when
there
seemed
no
way
of
speaking
again
to
her
and
all
the
outsiders
all
but
the
invited
guests
were
departed
he
had
been
obliged
to
go
too
perhaps
some
one
had
begun
to
notice
him
she
wondered
if
he
had
been
careful
about
his
shoes
his
hands
how
had
he
managed
about
the
dress
anyway
and
then
she
remembered
that
girl
that
pretty
american
with
the
ruddy
hair
to
whom
she
had
seen
him
talking
and
she
conjectured
that
there
was
feminine
aid
and
confidence
a
wave
of
bitterness
swept
over
her
he
had
told
that
girl
about
her
he
knew
that
girl
well
enough
to
tell
her
and
perhaps
he
was
only
sorry
for
the
poor
little
french
girl
in
the
turkish
harem
perhaps
they
were
sorry
had
he
told
that
girl
she
thought
with
bitter
mutiny
that
he
had
kissed
her
that
girl
must
have
been
very
sure
of
him
not
to
be
jealous
of
his
interest
in
herself
and
now
they
could
be
somewhere
together
perhaps
talking
her
over
while
she
was
here
here
forever
she
was
so
white
now
so
silent
so
distrait
that
all
the
chatter
of
the
younger
girls
who
were
lingering
around
her
could
not
dispel
the
feeling
of
depression
they
cast
covert
glances
of
discomfort
at
each
other
begged
for
more
music
from
the
orchestra
tallied
with
an
effort
of
the
size
and
spaciousness
of
the
palace
and
the
magnificence
of
the
feast
she
had
told
herself
that
she
had
ceased
to
hope
she
did
not
know
how
false
it
was
until
the
eunuch
brought
his
message
then
hope
really
died
the
general
was
below
and
begged
to
be
announced
to
madame
we
fly
whispered
a
lingerer
with
nervous
laughter
and
hastily
the
young
people
hurried
into
their
tcharchafs
and
veils
murmuring
among
themselves
with
sidelong
glances
at
that
white
figure
whose
cold
hand
and
cheek
they
had
just
touched
hastily
they
sped
like
nymphs
in
some
witches
robes
down
the
long
room
while
madame
de
coulevain
drew
back
a
strand
of
the
girl
dark
hair
and
murmured
but
smile
my
dear
to
the
still
figure
and
escaped
with
the
guests
and
then
aimée
was
alone
in
the
great
room
deserted
of
its
throngs
a
darkening
room
full
of
candles
and
fallen
flower
petals
with
here
and
there
the
traces
of
the
revelers
a
scented
handkerchief
a
fan
a
buckle
from
some
french
slipper
or
a
feather
from
some
ancient
turban
clasp
like
the
ghost
of
some
deserted
queen
with
her
regal
satins
and
glittering
circlet
she
waited
there
was
a
moment
of
grace
in
which
she
tried
to
turn
a
gallant
face
toward
the
next
moment
then
he
came
advancing
it
may
have
been
her
distorted
fancy
but
down
the
long
perspective
that
figure
looked
more
mincing
more
waspish
more
unreal
than
ever
and
she
was
conscious
of
that
swift
rising
of
dislike
of
antagonism
touched
with
reasonless
fear
chapter

the
bey
returns
he
kissed
her
hands
she
caught
the
murmur
of
compliments
and
the
mingled
scent
of
musk
and
wine
he
had
been
dining
at
his
reception
for
the
men
but
he
called
now
for
a
table
and
more
refreshment
a
small
table
was
brought
to
the
end
of
the
room
near
the
marriage
throne
where
all
the
day
she
had
paraded
a
richly
embroidered
cloth
of
satin
was
flung
over
it
and
from
crowding
candelabra
fresh
lights
shed
down
a
little
circle
of
brilliance
faintly
aimée
protested
that
eat
she
could
not
and
then
she
made
a
feint
of
eating
lingering
over
her
sherbets
because
eating
was
after
all
so
safe
and
uncomplicated
a
thing
the
black
brought
champagne
in
its
jacket
of
ice
and
filled
their
glasses
the
general
rose
notre
to
our
happiness
he
declared
holding
out
his
glass
and
she
clinked
her
own
to
it
and
brought
her
lips
to
touch
the
brim
but
not
to
that
toast
could
she
swallow
a
single
one
of
the
bubbles
that
went
winking
up
and
down
the
hollow
stem
the
glass
trembled
suddenly
in
her
hand
as
she
set
it
down
an
overpowering
sense
of
fatigue
was
upon
her
with
the
death
of
her
poor
hope
with
the
collapse
of
all
those
flighty
childish
dreams
the
leaden
weight
of
realities
seemed
to
descend
crushingly
upon
her
she
felt
stricken
inert
apathetic
it
was
all
so
unreal
so
bizarre
this
could
not
possibly
be
taking
place
in
her
life
this
fantastic
scene
this
table
set
with
lights
and
food
at
the
end
of
a
dark
deserted
old
room
opposite
this
grimacing
foppish
stranger
she
could
barely
master
strength
for
her
replies
how
had
it
all
gone
excellently
she
was
satisfied
with
her
new
home
with
the
service
the
appointments
he
plied
her
with
questions
and
she
tried
to
summon
her
spirit
she
achieved
a
few
perfunctory
phrases
the
words
of
a
frightened
child
struggling
for
its
manners
she
tried
to
smile
unconscious
of
the
betrayal
of
her
eyes
he
told
her
sketchily
of
his
day
a
bore
those
affairs
those
speeches
he
told
her
gazing
at
her
his
wine
glass
in
his
hand
a
flush
of
wine
and
excitement
in
his
face
she
found
it
unpleasant
to
look
at
him
her
glance
evaded
his
she
stammered
a
word
of
praise
for
the
palace
it
must
be
very
ancient
she
told
him
very
interesting
he
waved
a
hand
on
which
an
enormous
ruby
glittered
he
could
tell
her
stories
of
it
he
promised
it
had
been
built
by
one
of
the
mamelukes
his
ancestor
its
old
banqueting
hall
was
still
untouched
the
collectors
would
give
much
to
rifle
that
but
they
would
never
get
their
sharks
noses
in
nothing
had
been
changed
but
something
added
once
the
mad
khedive
had
borrowed
it
for
some
years
and
begun
his
eternal
additions
forty
girls
they
say
he
kept
here
smiled
hamdi
bey
they
gulped
their
pleasure
in
those
days
it
is
better
to
sip
is
it
not
he
smiled
but
these
are
no
stories
for
a
bride
i
only
trust
that
you
will
not
find
your
palace
dull
it
is
very
quiet
now
very
much
of
the
old
school
you
may
miss
your
pianos
your
electricity
all
your
pretty
parisian
modernity
she
glanced
at
the
glittering
table
but
i
do
not
find
this
so
so
much
of
the
old
school
here
one
does
not
eat
rice
with
the
fingers
and
i
said
the
bey
leaning
suddenly
towards
her
on
his
outspread
arm
do
you
find
me
too
much
of
the
old
school
eh
eh
but
you
monsieur
she
stammered
still
looking
down
you
i
do
not
know
you
not
yet
not
yet
excellent
there
will
be
time
i
confess
that
now
i
am
weary
ah
and
that
diadem
is
heavy
your
head
must
ache
with
it
he
said
solicitously
perhaps
it
was
the
diadem
that
gave
her
that
leaden
constricted
sense
of
a
band
tightening
about
her
forehead
she
put
up
her
hands
to
it
permit
me
he
said
quickly
springing
to
his
feet
permit
me
to
aid
you
he
stepped
behind
her
and
bent
over
her
she
held
her
head
very
still
stiff
with
distaste
and
felt
the
weight
lifted
he
surveyed
the
circlet
a
moment
then
placed
it
upon
the
marriage
throne
behind
her
she
had
an
ironic
memory
of
the
false
omen
of
her
crowning
of
soft
satisfied
little
bestowal
of
her
own
happiness
happiness
indeed
and
that
veil
surely
that
is
incommoding
suggested
the
suave
voice
and
she
felt
the
touch
of
his
hands
on
her
hair
where
the
misty
veil
was
secured
she
stammered
that
it
was
quite
light
she
would
not
trouble
him
then
she
held
herself
rigid
for
suddenly
he
had
swept
the
veil
aside
and
bent
to
press
his
lips
to
that
most
hidden
of
all
veiled
sanctities
for
a
moslem
the
back
of
her
neck
she
did
not
stir
she
sat
fixed
and
tense
then
slowly
the
blood
came
back
to
her
heart
for
he
was
moving
away
from
her
again
to
his
place
at
the
table
laughing
a
little
pulling
at
his
blond
mustache
in
a
gesture
of
conquest
his
kindling
eyes
glinting
down
at
her
you
must
forgive
the
precipitateness
of
a
lover
he
murmured
you
do
not
know
your
own
beauty
you
are
like
a
crystal
in
which
the
world
has
thrown
no
reflections
all
is
pure
and
transparent
if
she
did
not
find
words
to
answer
him
to
divert
his
admiration
she
felt
that
she
was
lost
you
are
not
complimentary
a
bit
of
glass
monsieur
instead
of
a
diamond
but
i
am
too
weary
to
be
exacting
if
now
you
will
permit
me
to
bid
you
good
evening
and
withdraw
little
trembler
said
the
general
facetiously
and
reached
out
a
hand
to
touch
her
cheek
the
light
reassuring
caress
that
one
might
give
a
petted
child
but
it
almost
brought
a
cry
of
nervous
terror
from
her
lips
she
thought
that
if
he
touched
her
again
she
would
scream
he
inspired
her
with
a
horrible
fear
there
was
something
so
false
so
smiling
in
him
he
was
like
an
ogre
sitting
down
to
a
delicate
dish
of
her
young
innocence
her
childish
terrors
her
frank
fears
she
could
not
have
told
why
she
found
him
so
horrible
but
everything
in
her
shrank
convulsively
from
him
and
the
need
of
courtesy
to
him
of
propititation
the
cup
was
bitterer
than
her
darkest
dreams
she
wondered
how
many
other
women
had
drained
such
deadly
brews
had
sat
in
such
ghastly
despair
before
some
other
bridegroom
affable
confident
masterful
she
told
herself
that
she
was
overwrought
hysterical
the
man
was
courteous
he
was
trying
to
be
agreeable
to
make
a
little
expected
love
he
had
drank
a
little
too
much
another
time
she
might
find
him
different
he
was
probably
no
worse
than
any
other
man
of
her
world
it
was
not
in
her
world
each
young
turkish
girl
said
in
those
days
that
one
could
find
love
but
it
was
her
world
it
was
an
alien
world
enforced
imprisoning
that
was
the
bitterest
gall
of
all
the
deadly
cup
there
is
no
need
for
haste
he
was
assuring
her
in
a
moment
i
will
call
your
woman
fatima
her
name
is
an
old
slave
of
our
house
i
could
wish
said
aimée
that
i
had
been
permitted
to
bring
my
old
nurse
miriam
without
whom
i
feel
strange
no
old
nurses
i
know
their
wiles
laughed
the
bey
setting
down
his
drained
cup
with
a
wavering
hand
they
are
never
for
the
husbands
those
old
nurses
we
will
have
no
old
trot
tricks
here
he
laughed
again
this
fatima
is
a
watch
dog
i
warn
you
my
little
one
but
if
she
does
not
please
you
we
can
find
another
and
as
for
the
rooms
i
have
assigned
this
suite
to
you
the
suite
of
honor
this
is
the
salon
and
there
he
pointed
to
a
curtained
door
behind
them
opening
into
a
small
room
that
aimée
had
already
seen
there
is
your
boudoir
and
beyond
that
your
sleeping
apartment
i
have
had
them
done
over
for
you
but
you
shall
choose
your
own
furnishings
everything
shall
be
to
your
taste
i
promise
you
you
are
too
sweet
to
deny
you
have
but
to
ask
certainly
she
thought
he
was
drunk
he
moved
his
head
so
jerkily
and
his
whole
body
swayed
so
queerly
desperately
she
fought
against
her
horror
perhaps
it
was
better
for
him
to
be
drunk
drunken
men
grow
sleepy
perhaps
he
would
fall
down
and
sleep
perhaps
she
ought
to
urge
him
to
drink
long
ago
the
black
had
left
the
bottle
at
his
elbow
and
gone
out
of
his
room
but
she
did
not
move
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
withdrawn
and
shrinking
watching
him
out
of
those
dark
terrified
eyes
you
are
beautiful
as
dreams
he
told
her
leaning
towards
her
with
such
abruptness
that
his
sword
struck
clankingly
against
the
table
beyond
even
the
words
of
my
babbling
cousin
eh
allah
reward
her
but
she
did
me
a
good
turn
with
her
talk
of
you
fixedly
he
stared
at
her
out
of
those
intent
inflamed
eyes
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
anything
like
you
in
the
harems
of
cairo
you
are
like
a
vision
of
the
old
poets
but
i
suppose
that
you
do
not
know
the
ancient
poetry
you
little
moderns
are
brought
up
upon
french
and
english
and
music
and
know
little
of
the
arabic
and
the
persian
i
daresay
that
you
have
never
heard
of
the
poet
utayyah
still
leaning
towards
her
he
began
to
intone
the
stanzas
in
a
very
fair
tenor
voice
and
if
his
movements
were
at
all
unsteady
his
speech
was
most
precise
and
accurate
from
her
radiance
the
sun
taketh
increase
when
she
unveileth
and
shameth
the
moonlight
bright
he
chuckled
ah
i
shall
put
the
triple
veil
upon
you
my
little
moon
how
is
this
one
sun
and
moon
of
palace
cast
thy
sight
enjoy
her
face
her
fragrant
light
thine
eyes
shall
never
see
in
hair
so
black
beauty
encase
a
brow
so
purely
white
he
got
up
and
drew
his
chair
closer
to
her
that
is
the
song
for
you
little
white
rose
of
beauty
back
went
her
own
chair
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
monsieur
but
now
have
i
your
permission
to
retire
for
it
has
been
a
long
day
and
i
am
indeed
fatigued
to
her
vexation
her
voice
was
trembling
but
she
steadied
it
proudly
i
bid
you
good
evening
nonsense
my
little
white
rose
this
is
not
so
fatiguing
a
few
words
more
but
you
are
like
the
flower
that
flies
before
the
wind
but
your
room
yes
to
be
sure
shall
i
show
you
the
way
i
can
discover
it
monsieur
monsieur
fie
on
you
my
little
dove
hamdi
i
tell
you
your
lover
hamdi
he
laughed
unsteadily
and
put
a
hand
on
her
arm
you
are
running
away
i
know
that
and
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
oh
it
was
tedious
in
that
villa
of
your
father
i
thought
to
myself
is
a
fine
story
a
funny
story
but
i
have
heard
them
all
before
and
you
are
in
no
haste
you
revelers
you
have
no
little
bride
waiting
for
you
at
that
one
glance
at
you
i
tell
you
it
was
the
glance
of
which
the
poet
sings
the
glance
that
cost
him
a
thousand
sighs
i
was
on
fire
with
impatience
for
i
am
beauty
slave
little
dove
you
may
have
heard
but
no
matter
a
wife
must
be
a
pearl
unspotted
i
am
not
as
the
english
who
take
their
wives
from
the
highways
where
all
men
glances
have
rested
upon
them
have
i
not
been
at
their
balls
their
women
dance
in
other
men
arms
they
marry
wives
whose
hands
other
men
have
pressed
sometimes
who
knows
their
lips
have
been
kissed
and
then
a
husband
takes
her
oh
many
thanks
he
laughed
sardonically
and
waved
his
hands
a
little
wildly
oh
i
know
english
all
the
europeans
i
have
seen
their
women
i
have
seen
them
selling
their
wares
stripping
themselves
half
bare
in
the
evenings
the
shameless
for
me
never
my
wife
is
a
hidden
treasure
you
know
what
the
poet
says
there
be
one
who
shares
with
me
her
love
i
strangle
love
tho
life
by
love
were
slain
saying
o
soul
death
were
the
nobler
choice
for
ill
is
love
when
shared
twixt
partners
twain
you
are
fond
of
your
poets
said
aimée
with
stiff
lips
you
you
kindle
poetic
fires
my
little
one
you
i
he
stammered
a
moment
then
forgot
his
fierce
speech
against
foreign
ways
you
have
the
raven
hair
his
hand
went
out
to
it
he
smoothed
it
back
out
of
her
eyes
then
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
desperately
she
resisted
monsieur
one
does
not
expect
a
gentleman
expect
ho
what
should
one
expect
when
a
man
has
such
a
little
sweetmeat
such
a
little
syrup
drop
such
a
rose
petal
come
come
you
would
not
struggle
but
it
was
not
the
struggling
hand
of
the
frightened
girl
that
sent
the
general
back
it
was
a
brown
sinewy
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
hand
protruding
from
a
well
tailored
gray
sleeve
and
lilac
striped
cuff
that
caught
hamdi
bey
by
the
epauleted
shoulder
and
sent
him
spinning
about
another
hand
was
holding
a
revolver
very
directly
at
him
silence
said
jack
ryder
in
his
best
turkish
and
repeated
it
with
amplification
in
english
not
a
sound
or
i
blow
your
head
off
aimée
gave
a
strangled
gasp
he
had
not
gone
then
he
had
hidden
there
in
some
nook
of
that
boudoir
behind
those
shadowy
curtains
waiting
to
protect
her
to
rescue
over
one
arm
he
had
the
black
mantle
and
veil
better
put
these
on
he
suggested
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
rigid
bey
and
then
run
for
it
but
you
you
i
take
care
of
myself
after
you
are
out
of
the
way
dare
you
try
that
or
what
do
you
suggest
oh
not
alone
together
so
so
said
hamdi
bey
inarticulately
his
head
nodded
he
staggered
his
knees
gave
way
and
he
crumpled
very
completely
upon
the
floor
and
lay
like
a
felled
log
after
a
quick
look
down
at
him
ryder
turned
to
aimée
quick
then
we
make
a
run
for
it
he
did
not
finish
hamdi
bey
upon
the
floor
fallen
half
under
the
folds
of
the
white
cloth
made
a
swift
and
very
expert
roll
and
darted
to
his
feet
beside
aimée
whirling
her
about
with
pinioned
elbows
for
his
shield
and
so
screened
he
gave
a
shrill
whistle
chapter
xiv
within
the
walls
ryder
sprang
forward
trying
to
reach
the
bey
but
he
dodged
skillfully
his
holding
aimée
blocked
ryder
in
his
attack
he
knew
that
high
peculiar
whistle
had
been
a
signal
a
call
for
aid
and
he
flung
a
lightning
glance
down
that
long
room
tightening
his
hold
on
the
revolver
but
he
did
not
see
the
small
door
that
opened
in
the
shadowy
paneling
behind
him
nor
the
shadow
that
grew
into
the
shape
of
the
black
as
it
launched
itself
through
the
air
upon
his
back
he
only
heard
aimée
scream
and
then
before
the
crashing
weight
upon
his
shoulders
he
staggered
and
went
down
the
bey
flung
aimée
aside
and
rushed
upon
the
prostrate
figure
kicking
the
revolver
from
the
outspread
hand
the
black
knelt
swiftly
down
unfastening
his
silken
sash
giddily
the
room
whirled
about
aimée
in
the
candle
light
leaping
in
the
rush
of
conflict
she
saw
the
bey
and
the
black
and
their
distorted
shadows
in
a
goblin
blur
and
beneath
them
she
saw
ryder
helpless
his
hands
and
feet
pinioned
with
the
madness
of
despair
she
rushed
forward
but
the
general
intercepted
her
he
is
quite
helpless
you
need
not
be
alarmed
for
my
safety
madame
the
cold
biting
fury
of
his
voice
steadied
her
she
saw
his
face
was
distorted
livid
with
anger
his
breathing
was
stertorous
she
stood
helplessly
by
the
table
the
general
turned
and
looked
down
upon
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
dared
to
violate
the
sanctity
of
his
harem
and
attempt
to
steal
his
bride
beyond
the
man
head
yussuf
the
black
was
squatting
with
a
grinning
watchfulness
but
ryder
did
not
require
watching
that
sash
had
been
tied
strongly
about
his
hands
and
feet
he
was
as
helpless
as
a
baby
but
the
peculiar
flavor
of
his
helplessness
was
not
so
much
fear
before
the
fanatic
fury
of
this
man
he
had
outraged
although
he
had
a
clear
notion
that
his
position
was
not
enviably
secure
but
a
bitter
black
chagrin
to
have
had
the
game
in
his
hands
and
have
bungled
it
to
have
been
surprised
by
that
simple
strategy
taken
off
his
guard
by
a
feigned
collapse
the
wily
old
turk
for
all
his
champagne
had
the
clearer
quicker
brain
to
have
let
him
get
to
aimée
and
call
in
his
black
to
have
been
thrown
disarmed
it
was
crass
stupidity
it
was
outrageous
mismanagement
abominable
maddening
and
aimée
must
pay
for
it
he
tried
to
think
very
quickly
what
could
best
clear
her
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
those
glittering
eyes
staring
down
upon
him
i
realize
i
owe
you
an
explanation
he
said
grimly
if
you
will
let
me
tell
you
the
bey
turned
to
aimée
with
a
smile
that
was
the
lifting
of
a
lip
and
the
distention
of
his
nostrils
this
fool
thinks
he
has
the
time
to
talk
his
english
desperately
ryder
grasped
for
his
vernacular
i
want
to
tell
you
why
i
came
this
this
young
lady
does
know
me
past
the
general
he
shot
a
look
of
warning
at
the
girl
i
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
her
for
her
family
in
france
she
is
really
a
french
girl
tewfick
pasha
is
not
her
father
but
her
he
could
not
find
the
word
and
dropped
into
english
her
do
you
understand
and
he
had
no
business
to
marry
her
off
so
i
tried
to
steal
her
for
the
french
family
it
was
a
mad
attempt
which
has
failed
but
for
which
the
young
lady
should
not
be
blamed
she
had
never
seen
me
before
she
had
no
idea
i
was
here
after
a
pause
a
remarkable
story
said
the
general
distinctly
he
turned
about
to
the
table
and
drank
off
the
last
of
a
glass
of
champagne
then
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
a
hand
that
trembled
he
turned
back
to
stand
over
his
prostrate
invader
now
you
you
dog
of
satan
he
snarled
in
a
sudden
snapping
of
restraint
how
did
you
get
here
who
admitted
you
and
at
that
for
all
his
trussed
and
helpless
plight
jack
ryder
grinned
he
moved
his
head
slightly
that
blackbird
of
yours
here
yussuf
never
the
very
one
but
he
did
know
it
i
was
in
that
black
mantle
and
veil
oh
the
mantle
i
had
forgot
so
you
stole
in
disguised
to
violate
my
hospitality
to
outrage
my
harem
to
gaze
upon
the
forbidden
faces
of
women
and
to
steal
the
bride
i
tell
you
i
was
trying
to
rescue
the
girl
for
her
french
family
she
french
and
tewfick
pasha
is
only
and
what
is
that
to
me
do
i
the
bey
broke
off
and
then
turned
to
the
silent
girl
who
stood
leaning
towards
them
a
trembling
ghost
in
white
and
you
my
little
one
he
murmured
sardonically
with
a
savage
irony
of
restraint
you
the
little
dove
secluded
from
the
world
who
trembled
at
a
kiss
the
crystal
vase
who
had
never
reflected
the
blush
of
love
whose
virginal
praises
i
was
chanting
when
i
was
so
oddly
assaulted
do
you
support
this
idiot
story
mechanically
her
head
moved
in
assent
her
eyes
dilated
with
fear
were
like
the
dark
fascinated
eyes
of
some
helpless
bird
you
never
saw
this
young
man
the
bey
pursued
and
yet
you
were
ready
to
run
off
with
him
a
pretty
character
you
give
yourself
my
snowdrop
and
you
liked
his
eyes
and
hastened
to
obey
aimée
was
silent
from
his
ignominy
upon
the
floor
ryder
hastened
to
interpose
it
is
true
she
had
never
seen
me
but
i
had
already
written
to
her
and
acquainted
her
with
the
story
i
tried
to
reach
her
first
through
her
father
but
that
was
useless
so
i
resorted
to
these
desperate
means
oh
you
wrote
and
you
told
her
you
would
be
here
and
murder
her
husband
i
told
her
nothing
of
the
kind
she
did
know
that
i
was
coming
until
i
spoke
to
her
here
and
then
she
had
no
idea
that
i
was
going
to
wait
and
carry
her
off
in
the
name
of
allah
do
you
take
me
for
a
dolt
an
ass
you
with
your
writing
and
your
masquerade
and
your
secrets
do
any
families
try
to
recover
their
relatives
with
such
means
daughter
or
it
is
nothing
to
me
but
it
is
true
aimée
insisted
in
a
trembling
voice
my
father
was
paul
delcassé
kiddisak
man
curse
the
man
who
brought
thee
up
delcassé
or
devil
it
is
tewfick
pasha
who
is
your
your
guardian
who
gave
you
to
me
for
wife
what
has
your
genealogy
to
do
with
this
affront
upon
my
honor
but
he
did
not
intend
to
affront
your
honor
only
to
aid
the
family
in
france
i
ask
you
again
do
i
resemble
an
ass
that
you
should
put
such
a
burden
of
lies
upon
me
as
if
i
did
not
know
why
young
men
risked
their
lives
in
the
dead
of
night
in
other
men
rooms
if
i
did
not
know
what
turns
their
brains
to
mush
and
their
hearts
to
leading
strings
and
you
you
you
little
white
rose
of
seclusion
his
venom
leaped
out
at
her
in
his
voice
it
was
a
terrible
voice
the
cold
grating
menace
of
a
madman
you
who
had
never
seen
this
man
but
who
fluttered
to
him
like
a
white
moth
to
a
fire
you
who
cowered
from
your
husband
hand
but
who
turned
to
follow
this
strange
dog
into
the
streets
there
will
be
care
taken
of
you
later
but
now
you
complained
of
fatigue
surely
this
scene
is
overtaxing
for
your
delicacy
if
you
will
come
to
your
rooms
she
drew
back
from
the
hand
he
laid
upon
her
do
not
injure
him
by
allah
truth
he
is
rash
mad
but
a
stranger
he
did
not
know
he
needs
enlightenment
he
needs
to
learn
that
a
nobleman
harem
is
not
a
café
of
dancing
girls
where
all
may
enter
and
stare
and
fondle
he
shall
learn
and
now
come
i
shall
not
go
she
said
breathlessly
what
struggle
but
your
father
has
been
strangely
remiss
with
his
discipline
permit
me
his
hand
tightened
in
a
grasp
of
iron
my
train
is
caught
she
said
in
a
tone
of
sudden
pettishness
she
stooped
to
lift
it
with
her
hand
that
was
free
my
train
he
mimicked
her
in
a
quivering
falsetto
have
a
care
of
my
frock
do
not
crush
my
chiffons
and
these
are
the
women
for
whom
men
break
their
heads
and
hearts
i
tell
you
sir
came
urgently
from
ryder
that
the
girl
is
innocent
of
all
keep
your
tongue
from
her
name
and
your
eyes
from
her
face
come
madame
with
his
iron
grasp
on
her
elbow
he
thrust
her
towards
the
boudoir
at
the
end
of
the
behind
whose
curtains
ryder
had
so
long
been
hiding
the
chamber
was
in
darkness
lighted
only
by
a
pale
gleam
from
the
other
room
aimée
stumbled
across
the
rug
and
found
herself
upon
a
huge
divan
against
a
window
screen
fatima
is
in
the
next
room
to
come
at
a
call
but
perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
wait
for
me
alone
i
shall
not
be
long
desperately
she
caught
at
his
arm
imploring
i
beg
you
monsieur
he
has
done
no
real
harm
let
him
go
he
is
a
stranger
he
did
not
know
and
he
will
never
trouble
you
again
i
will
do
anything
everything
you
desire
if
only
you
will
not
injure
him
you
trouble
yourself
strangely
for
a
stranger
he
is
a
stranger
in
danger
for
my
sake
for
it
was
in
his
duty
to
my
my
family
her
trembling
lips
stumbled
over
the
ridiculous
lies
that
he
has
blundered
into
this
he
has
no
idea
how
shocking
a
thing
he
has
and
you
had
no
idea
either
i
suppose
you
had
never
heard
of
honor
or
treachery
or
i
was
wrong
oh
i
was
wrong
i
did
want
to
go
to
france
i
own
it
and
i
was
not
ready
for
marriage
and
i
had
heard
that
you
i
was
afraid
but
now
if
you
will
let
him
go
for
my
sake
if
you
will
not
visit
my
sins
upon
him
oh
i
should
be
so
grateful
so
grateful
that
anything
i
can
ever
do
but
you
will
be
grateful
anyway
my
little
blossom
i
promise
you
that
you
will
learn
to
be
very
grateful
it
is
easier
to
die
than
to
learn
to
love
a
hated
one
she
reminded
him
softly
leaning
towards
him
i
can
die
very
willingly
monsieur
and
you
would
not
want
a
wife
before
whom
there
was
always
an
object
of
terror
through
the
dusk
her
great
eyes
sought
his
be
generous
and
harm
him
not
she
breathed
i
beg
of
you
i
implore
and
if
i
am
lenient
you
will
always
be
grateful
mutely
she
nodded
her
eyes
trying
pitifully
to
read
that
shadowy
mask
of
mockery
he
turned
towards
her
and
how
grateful
could
you
be
little
dove
pitifully
she
smiled
could
you
he
murmured
could
you
learn
to
kiss
he
leaned
nearer
and
involuntarily
she
shrank
back
faintly
at
this
moment
i
beg
of
you
monsieur
oh
if
it
is
to
be
an
affair
of
moments
we
shall
never
find
the
right
one
but
you
were
so
full
of
promises
i
will
do
anything
said
aimée
convulsively
if
you
will
promise
me
come
then
a
kiss
a
peck
from
my
little
dove
she
looked
at
him
out
of
wretched
eyes
and
you
promise
to
free
him
not
to
hurt
him
i
promise
not
to
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
come
that
is
generous
is
it
as
to
freeing
him
h
that
is
for
later
perhaps
if
you
are
very
good
a
kiss
then
and
later
he
bent
over
her
she
shut
her
eyes
and
heard
the
taunt
of
his
laugh
she
kissed
him
and
he
laughed
again
what
is
it
the
afghan
poets
say
lips
lose
no
sweetness
but
renew
their
freshness
with
the
moon
certainly
if
you
have
ever
been
kissed
little
bud
you
have
lost
no
dew
delicious
i
shall
hurry
back
he
cast
a
hard
look
down
at
her
as
she
sat
there
her
arms
drooping
at
her
sides
he
looked
about
the
room
as
if
consideringly
then
nodded
at
an
unseen
door
at
the
right
fatima
is
there
if
you
want
lights
or
assistance
and
alsamit
yussuf
brother
is
at
the
other
door
beyond
do
not
stir
little
bird
i
shall
be
back
very
soon
and
he
you
promised
i
shall
not
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
but
he
was
smiling
evilly
in
the
darkness
as
he
drew
shut
the
door
and
returned
to
the
bound
figure
by
the
guarding
black
for
a
moment
he
stood
silent
considering
while
yussuf
looked
up
with
intentness
like
an
eager
dog
ready
for
the
word
of
attack
then
in
hasty
turkish
the
general
gave
his
directions
and
the
black
nodded
and
strode
to
a
portière
jerking
it
down
which
he
wrapped
about
ryder
helpless
form
then
he
hoisted
his
burden
over
his
huge
shoulder
and
bore
it
on
after
the
general
across
the
great
room
they
went
and
down
the
long
stairs
up
which
that
day
a
most
complacent
hamdi
bey
had
escorted
his
bride
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
a
shadowy
figure
of
a
sleeping
eunuch
was
stretched
hamdi
bey
spoke
sharply
giving
a
quick
order
the
black
scrambled
to
his
feet
yawned
nodded
and
strode
away
into
the
main
vestibule
and
out
into
the
garden
to
investigate
a
shadow
which
the
general
had
just
reported
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
the
general
and
yussuf
with
his
unwieldy
burden
came
quietly
down
the
stairs
and
turned
back
into
a
long
dark
hall
for
a
moment
they
paused
outside
a
wide
banqueting
room
and
there
hamdi
bey
stood
listening
straining
attentive
ears
for
the
faint
sounds
from
the
service
quarters
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
caught
the
guttural
of
a
half
inaudible
voice
and
the
wash
of
water
and
clink
of
a
dish
showing
that
the
belated
work
of
the
reception
was
going
draggingly
on
but
it
was
all
far
away
and
invisible
satisfied
he
went
on
a
few
steps
to
a
pointed
door
set
in
the
heavy
stone
from
a
nail
he
took
down
a
lantern
of
heavy
fretted
brass
and
lighted
it
not
without
some
difficulty
for
his
hands
were
still
trembling
then
he
took
from
the
black
a
cumbersome
key
which
he
fitted
into
the
lock
and
turned
heavily
drawing
back
the
door
he
motioned
yussuf
ahead
and
followed
drawing
the
door
shut
down
a
steep
stone
spiral
stair
they
went
and
at
the
bottom
at
the
general
order
the
black
set
ryder
down
from
his
shoulder
and
flung
aside
the
portière
from
its
muffling
folds
ryder
looked
out
bewilderedly
into
the
darkness
about
him
illumined
only
by
the
yellow
flare
of
the
ancient
lantern
the
general
cautioned
him
to
silence
while
yussuf
knelt
and
untied
the
strip
that
bound
his
feet
then
his
arms
still
bound
he
was
ordered
to
march
on
before
them
this
he
said
to
himself
as
he
silently
obeyed
that
order
this
really
was
the
time
to
pinch
himself
and
wake
up
of
all
the
dark
eerie
nightmares
this
slow
procession
through
these
underground
halls
the
giant
black
on
his
heels
the
general
lantern
throwing
its
flickering
rays
over
the
huge
seamed
blocks
of
granite
foundations
it
made
him
think
of
the
catacombs
it
made
him
think
of
the
serapeum
it
made
him
think
of
those
damp
tortuous
underground
ways
of
the
villa
bordoni
they
seemed
to
be
in
the
wine
cellars
he
saw
bins
and
barrels
and
barred
vaults
that
would
have
done
credit
to
an
english
squire
and
he
reflected
fleetly
that
wine
bibbing
was
forbidden
to
mohammedans
and
that
hamdi
bey
was
a
fanatic
moslem
then
he
saw
open
spaces
of
ancient
stuffs
broken
tables
and
dismantled
caiques
and
a
broken
oar
his
earlier
observation
of
the
palace
had
told
him
that
it
had
a
water
gate
and
he
thought
now
that
they
might
be
near
some
opening
he
wondered
if
they
were
going
to
throw
him
pinioned
into
the
river
he
would
put
it
past
this
livid
silent
shaking
man
and
yet
the
thing
appeared
so
impossible
so
theatric
so
utterly
unrelated
to
any
of
the
ways
that
he
jack
ryder
might
be
expected
to
end
his
days
that
it
could
possibly
send
more
than
a
shiver
of
speculation
down
his
spine
and
yet
men
been
thrown
into
rivers
this
very
river
and
men
had
disappeared
from
just
such
palaces
as
this
there
was
the
story
about
young
monkton
he
knew
it
perfectly
he
had
reminded
himself
of
it
the
last
evening
while
he
reflected
upon
this
escapade
but
he
had
never
actually
appreciated
the
peculiar
poignancy
of
the
thing
until
now
monkton
had
met
so
rumor
reported
a
turkish
lady
of
position
flirted
with
her
it
was
said
while
on
horseback
outside
her
motor
when
caught
in
the
crush
at
bridge
there
had
been
a
meeting
or
two
in
the
back
of
shops
and
then
he
had
boasted
lightheartedly
of
a
design
to
take
tea
in
her
harem
he
had
never
boasted
about
the
tea
no
one
had
ever
seen
monkton
again
and
he
was
generally
reported
after
a
stifled
inquiry
to
have
been
thrown
from
his
horse
in
the
desert
or
spilled
out
of
his
sailing
canoe
the
government
english
or
egyptian
assumed
no
interest
in
the
matter
of
gentlemen
found
in
other
gentlemen
harems
there
were
other
stories
too
there
was
one
of
a
little
viennese
actress
who
after
a
dramatic
escape
reported
a
whole
winter
of
captivity
in
one
of
these
old
palaces
and
there
was
a
vaguer
rumor
of
a
rash
young
american
girl
detained
for
days
ryder
had
always
known
these
stories
they
were
part
of
the
gossip
and
thrill
of
cairo
but
he
had
never
till
now
realized
how
exquisitely
possible
was
their
occurrence
anything
everything
might
happen
in
these
hidden
secret
chambers
these
turks
were
as
much
masters
here
as
their
old
predecessors
who
had
reared
these
stones
this
black
upon
his
heels
might
have
been
the
grinning
faithful
executioner
of
some
khedive
or
caliph
he
might
have
been
the
very
masrur
the
sworder
of
vengeance
of
al
raschid
he
told
himself
that
it
was
no
time
to
think
of
the
past
his
business
acutely
was
the
present
if
only
he
could
get
his
hands
untied
if
only
he
could
get
those
untied
hands
upon
that
demoniac
turk
but
strain
as
he
could
upon
the
knots
they
held
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
been
walking
for
an
interminable
distance
in
odd
roundabout
ways
once
they
had
stopped
and
he
had
involuntarily
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
but
at
a
word
from
the
general
he
had
kept
his
head
forward
again
while
he
heard
the
black
behind
him
gathering
something
that
clinked
later
a
stolen
glance
had
revealed
the
eunuch
with
some
tools
in
one
hand
and
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
bag
disquieted
him
bags
filled
a
foreboding
place
in
the
eastern
literature
of
vengeance
he
wondered
if
he
were
to
go
into
the
river
in
that
bag
with
the
tools
for
weight
he
decided
feeling
now
a
very
odd
and
definite
disturbance
in
the
region
of
his
stomach
that
he
would
tell
that
general
that
he
was
a
cousin
of
the
late
lord
cromer
and
a
nephew
of
lord
kitchener
something
insistent
would
have
to
be
done
about
this
they
were
passing
now
through
a
strange
open
space
between
old
arches
that
for
an
instant
arrested
his
excavator
interest
he
saw
in
the
shadows
about
them
a
crumpled
crumbling
dome
and
broken
shafts
with
half
a
wall
of
masonry
pierced
with
arabesques
traces
of
old
ruins
fragments
of
some
old
forgotten
mosque
over
which
the
palace
had
spread
its
foundations
in
bygone
days
buried
treasure
looted
some
of
it
for
the
palace
overhead
but
still
rare
and
lovely
that
was
a
gleam
of
lapis
lazuli
that
winked
at
him
from
the
crumbling
mortar
under
his
feet
then
they
were
between
other
walls
not
crumbling
ones
but
the
solid
pillared
blocks
of
the
palace
masonry
with
here
and
there
broad
arches
of
old
brick
they
stopped
between
two
arches
the
general
held
his
lantern
high
flashing
it
over
the
surface
while
yussuf
swung
down
his
sack
and
knocked
with
the
handle
of
his
tool
suddenly
he
stopped
and
looked
at
his
master
nodding
cheerfully
the
general
lowered
his
light
and
stepped
back
and
yussuf
reared
the
pickaxe
in
his
powerful
arms
and
sent
it
dexterously
at
the
wall
between
two
broken
bits
of
brick
it
caught
and
sent
the
mortar
spraying
another
blow
and
another
loosened
a
hole
in
which
the
black
inserted
a
short
iron
and
began
nervously
grinding
and
prying
ryder
watching
with
oppressed
and
helpless
fury
saw
the
bricks
at
last
break
and
tumble
faster
and
faster
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
saw
a
pocket
in
the
wall
become
revealed
a
long
upright
niche
the
size
perhaps
of
a
man
coffin
on
end
he
tried
very
suddenly
to
talk
his
tongue
felt
thick
and
swollen
and
there
seemed
no
words
in
all
the
world
to
fit
his
need
of
overcoming
this
fanatic
madman
and
after
all
he
had
no
chance
for
them
for
yussuf
with
a
huge
palm
upon
his
mouth
urged
him
suddenly
backwards
towards
that
horrible
niche
gently
yussuf
gently
said
the
general
suavely
and
with
a
slow
distinctness
that
was
for
ryder
ears
i
gave
my
word
that
i
would
not
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
grinning
the
black
lifted
him
over
the
remaining
wall
and
set
him
down
into
the
niche
leaving
him
standing
in
there
like
a
helpless
statue
tasting
to
the
full
fury
of
his
heart
the
bitterness
of
his
helplessness
and
the
ludicrous
impotence
of
all
struggle
good
god
sir
you
must
be
mad
he
said
in
a
strained
sharp
voice
that
his
ears
would
not
have
known
as
his
own
do
you
realize
there
will
be
an
inquiry
there
is
such
a
thing
as
law
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
talked
in
english
and
stammering
arabic
for
a
long
time
the
black
was
kneeling
out
of
sight
stooping
over
a
basin
of
water
and
his
abominable
sack
and
ryder
was
facing
that
silent
sardonic
face
with
its
fantastic
mustache
its
evil
gloating
eyes
he
stopped
for
very
shame
the
man
was
mad
mad
and
drunk
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
philip
drunk
to
philip
sober
mad
or
drunk
he
had
devised
his
vengeance
shrewdly
upon
ryder
helpless
body
a
cold
sweat
of
incredulous
horror
broke
softly
out
at
his
feet
he
heard
the
black
beginning
to
fit
his
bricks
and
smooth
his
mortar
you
do
well
to
save
your
breath
said
hamdi
bey
at
last
as
ryder
still
stood
silent
you
will
need
it
in
this
chamber
i
am
providing
but
it
may
be
he
said
thoughtfully
that
your
breath
will
last
your
need
thirst
may
be
the
more
impatient
for
her
victim
they
tell
me
thirst
is
an
obtrusive
visitor
as
you
were
this
evening
still
why
do
you
not
cry
out
a
little
it
will
amuse
my
black
yes
this
was
real
ryder
reminded
himself
and
these
things
could
happen
had
happened
he
remembered
suddenly
the
hideous
scene
outside
the
dungeons
in
francesca
da
rimini
when
that
bestial
brother
goes
in
to
the
helpless
prisoners
he
remembered
the
sick
horror
of
those
groans
he
remembered
also
various
excursions
of
his
in
the
tower
of
london
and
the
seigniory
of
florence
and
the
sight
of
old
rings
and
stakes
and
racks
and
the
feeling
of
their
total
unrelatedness
to
every
actuality
and
yet
they
had
happened
and
this
thing
for
all
its
fantastic
medieval
horror
was
happening
brick
by
brick
the
imprisoning
wall
was
rising
brick
by
brick
it
intervened
between
him
and
sane
sensible
happy
normal
life
eye
for
eye
he
gave
the
general
back
his
look
he
had
always
wondered
about
the
poor
devils
in
underground
torture
chambers
had
wondered
how
they
had
the
stuff
to
hold
out
against
such
odds
for
some
belief
some
information
now
he
knew
the
stiffening
stuff
of
a
personal
hate
upholding
to
the
very
grave
that
sardonic
devil
face
that
face
which
was
going
back
upstairs
to
aimée
but
he
must
not
think
of
that
or
he
should
give
way
and
begin
to
babble
to
plead
he
must
simply
stand
and
meet
that
glance
and
there
came
the
incredible
insane
moment
when
ryder
looked
out
on
that
face
through
one
last
breathing
space
and
then
saw
the
fitted
brick
settled
into
place
blot
the
world
to
darkness
before
his
eyes
chapter
xv
underground
alone
in
the
gloom
of
that
strange
room
aimée
sat
rigid
listening
not
a
sound
beyond
the
closed
door
from
the
long
drawing
room
not
a
sound
beyond
the
other
door
from
the
room
where
the
slave
fatima
waited
to
assist
in
her
disrobing
silence
everywhere
save
for
a
low
lapping
of
water
against
the
masonry
beneath
her
windows
the
palace
was
on
the
river
then
or
on
some
old
backwater
she
remembered
glimpses
of
dark
canals
on
her
drive
that
morning
had
it
only
been
that
morning
the
sound
of
that
soft
hidden
water
added
to
her
feeling
of
isolation
and
remoteness
from
everything
that
had
been
her
life
before
she
thought
fleetingly
almost
indifferently
of
her
friends
azima
who
had
crowned
her
for
happiness
and
fond
foolish
old
miriam
and
madame
de
coulevain
and
tewfick
pasha
weakly
cruel
but
amiable
she
thought
of
them
all
as
unreal
figures
from
whom
she
had
long
taken
leave
the
old
life
was
over
it
had
died
for
her
when
she
passed
through
the
dark
doorway
and
met
that
arrogant
sardonic
fatuous
man
the
master
of
this
palace
or
more
truly
that
old
life
had
died
for
her
when
she
had
flung
a
black
mantle
about
her
chiffon
frock
and
a
street
veil
across
her
sparkling
face
and
had
stolen
daring
and
breathless
into
the
lights
and
revelry
of
that
hotel
masquerade
there
when
she
had
shrunk
back
from
the
harlequin
and
had
looked
up
to
meet
the
kindling
glance
of
that
mask
in
tartans
yes
there
the
old
life
had
died
for
her
forever
if
only
she
had
known
it
and
now
she
would
only
like
to
die
too
she
thought
miserably
after
she
had
been
assured
of
ryder
safety
she
was
tense
with
fear
for
him
distrusting
in
every
fiber
the
assurance
of
that
fanatic
outraged
turk
she
was
not
utterly
resourceless
when
ryder
revolver
had
dropped
to
the
floor
she
had
maneuvered
unseen
by
hamdi
bey
to
get
her
train
over
it
and
when
she
had
stooped
for
her
train
her
one
free
hand
had
closed
over
the
revolver
handle
beneath
the
satin
and
lace
now
the
revolver
lay
on
the
divan
and
very
eagerly
she
drew
it
out
feeling
it
in
the
darkness
curling
her
finger
about
the
trigger
never
in
her
life
had
she
fired
a
shot
for
her
most
formidable
weapon
had
been
the
bows
and
arrows
of
the
children
archery
contest
of
the
english
club
but
she
felt
in
herself
now
that
highstrung
tensity
which
at
all
cost
would
carry
her
on
carefully
she
bestowed
the
small
steel
thing
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
then
she
stared
questioningly
at
the
dress
itself
hastily
unpinning
the
veil
and
tying
the
long
train
up
to
her
girdle
then
with
a
wary
glance
for
the
closed
door
behind
which
waited
that
fatima
she
dreaded
she
stole
to
the
door
the
general
had
shut
and
pressed
it
softly
ajar
peering
out
into
the
deserted
throne
room
like
a
great
cave
of
darkness
the
room
stretched
before
her
peopled
with
goblin
shadows
from
the
dying
candles
upon
the
disordered
abandoned
table
she
saw
the
chair
pushed
back
where
she
had
risen
to
struggle
with
the
bey
the
long
folds
of
white
cloth
sweeping
the
floor
behind
which
hamdi
had
rolled
so
agilely
a
stain
was
still
spreading
about
an
upset
glass
and
from
the
overturned
cooler
the
ice
water
was
dripping
dripping
with
a
steady
sinister
implication
she
thought
of
flight
there
was
another
black
the
general
had
warned
her
beyond
the
door
and
there
would
be
bars
and
bolts
on
any
egress
from
the
harem
but
with
the
revolver
in
her
possession
some
desperate
escape
might
be
achieved
but
ryder
no
the
gun
was
for
another
purpose
she
would
not
squander
it
yet
upon
herself
from
the
boudoir
she
moved
slowly
carrying
one
of
the
gilt
candelabra
from
the
table
to
light
the
room
she
would
need
light
for
her
plan
for
ages
long
unending
ages
she
sat
there
waiting
a
hundred
times
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
stand
no
more
that
she
must
make
her
way
out
at
all
costs
must
discover
what
fate
they
were
dealing
to
ryder
but
still
she
forced
herself
to
sit
there
her
pulses
racing
her
heart
sick
with
suspense
but
desperately
waiting
she
felt
a
sudden
wave
of
weakness
go
through
her
at
an
advancing
step
from
the
next
room
but
her
chin
was
up
her
eyes
fixed
and
desperate
as
the
figure
of
the
general
appeared
in
her
opening
door
ah
light
this
is
more
cheerful
little
one
she
had
risen
half
moved
towards
him
is
he
safe
the
stranger
safe
as
treasure
buried
treasure
little
one
the
bey
laughed
and
that
laughter
and
the
glittering
satisfaction
of
his
eyes
filled
her
with
foreboding
although
his
next
words
came
with
smiling
reassurance
not
a
hair
of
his
head
is
hurt
i
give
you
my
word
but
where
is
he
what
have
you
done
shut
him
up
to
be
sure
kept
him
as
hostage
for
your
sweet
humility
a
novel
way
to
win
a
bride
oh
essence
of
shyness
malevolently
he
smiled
down
at
her
and
in
the
back
of
her
frightened
mind
she
realized
that
this
man
did
well
to
be
angry
that
the
affront
to
him
had
been
immeasurable
and
that
many
a
turk
would
have
simply
driven
his
dagger
through
the
intruder
heart
and
her
own
too
but
though
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
there
was
forbearance
in
him
she
felt
instinctively
that
there
was
deeper
kindness
in
direct
thrusting
fury
than
in
this
man
sinister
mockery
she
had
sunk
back
upon
the
divan
on
the
bey
approach
now
as
he
stood
before
her
with
that
mask
of
a
smile
upon
his
face
drawing
a
silk
handkerchief
across
a
forehead
she
saw
glistening
in
the
candlelight
she
leaned
towards
him
again
her
hands
involuntarily
clasping
monsieur
i
seem
to
have
done
you
a
great
wrong
she
said
tremblingly
but
it
is
not
so
great
as
you
suppose
will
you
listen
to
me
i
useless
useless
he
waved
the
handkerchief
negligently
at
her
i
have
had
words
enough
you
are
not
the
daughter
of
tewfick
pasha
you
are
his
your
french
family
desires
to
capture
you
i
know
the
rigmarole
by
heart
you
observe
and
of
course
when
a
french
family
desires
to
obtain
possession
of
a
charming
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
that
family
always
employs
a
handsome
young
man
to
break
into
the
chamber
and
point
a
gun
at
the
husband
his
mustache
lifted
in
a
grimacing
sneer
but
it
true
and
i
french
she
interposed
swiftly
excellent
i
do
not
object
in
the
least
he
shot
his
handkerchief
up
his
cuff
and
turned
to
her
with
eyes
that
lightly
mocked
the
agonized
appeal
of
the
young
face
french
blood
is
delightful
quicksilver
and
champagne
you
will
enliven
me
i
promise
you
but
the
marriage
it
is
not
legal
monsieur
she
said
desperately
summoning
all
her
courage
tewfick
pasha
has
no
right
to
give
me
to
you
indulgently
he
smiled
down
at
her
then
his
narrowed
eyes
traveled
slowly
about
the
room
but
this
is
a
strange
time
and
place
to
talk
of
legalities
do
not
distress
yourself
your
is
your
guardian
and
your
marriage
will
be
as
binding
as
the
oaths
of
the
prophet
have
no
qualms
and
now
if
your
french
blood
will
smile
a
little
he
started
to
seat
himself
beside
her
but
in
that
instant
she
was
on
her
feet
with
all
the
courage
in
her
beating
heart
she
whipped
out
that
revolver
and
pointed
it
at
him
if
you
call
i
shoot
she
said
breathlessly
the
round
mouth
of
the
gun
shook
ever
so
slightly
in
the
excited
hand
gripping
it
but
in
the
blazing
look
she
turned
on
him
was
the
unshaken
imperious
passion
of
a
woman
swept
absolutely
beyond
all
fear
meeting
that
look
hamdi
bey
stood
extremely
still
and
made
no
sound
there
are
plenty
of
shots
for
you
at
the
first
noise
and
for
the
servants
if
they
come
she
went
on
in
that
fierce
undertone
and
then
passionately
what
did
you
do
to
him
take
me
to
him
at
once
irresolutely
the
man
stood
and
looked
up
at
her
under
his
lids
he
was
near
enough
for
a
spring
and
yet
if
that
excited
finger
should
press
the
girl
was
capable
of
anything
she
was
possessed
and
men
had
died
of
such
accidents
before
that
may
i
speak
he
murmured
in
a
tone
scarcely
audible
yet
preserving
somehow
its
flavor
of
sardonic
amusement
under
your
breath
one
sound
remember
and
i
am
a
very
good
shot
but
what
a
wife
he
sighed
all
the
talents
i
tell
you
that
i
will
see
him
for
myself
take
me
to
him
this
moment
shall
i
give
orders
and
have
him
brought
here
he
is
quite
safe
i
assure
you
orders
if
you
summon
a
servant
i
will
shoot
no
lead
the
way
and
i
will
follow
you
and
if
you
make
one
sound
one
false
move
decidedly
the
girl
was
possessed
she
stood
there
like
a
white
image
of
war
her
hand
on
that
infernal
automatic
he
hesitated
gnawed
his
mustache
then
swung
sullenly
upon
his
heel
like
some
fantastic
sculpture
from
an
amazonian
triumph
they
crossed
the
long
the
erect
general
preceding
very
slowly
the
feminine
creature
who
held
one
hand
extended
with
something
boring
almost
into
his
shoulder
blades
he
did
not
lead
her
down
the
long
stairs
past
the
guarding
eunuch
he
took
instead
an
inner
way
through
the
late
supper
room
which
led
down
into
the
pillared
hall
of
banquets
that
way
was
safe
of
servants
now
crossing
the
pillared
hall
there
were
no
more
sounds
of
late
work
from
the
service
quarters
beyond
oblivious
of
the
wild
developments
of
that
wedding
reception
the
tired
servants
stuffed
with
the
last
pasty
warmed
with
the
last
surreptitious
drop
of
wine
were
asleep
at
last
outside
the
door
in
the
stone
wall
the
bey
took
down
the
lantern
which
so
short
a
time
before
he
had
replaced
upon
its
nail
and
lighted
its
still
smoking
wick
he
had
not
restored
the
key
to
yussuf
and
he
drew
it
now
from
his
pocket
and
fitted
it
into
the
lock
drawing
back
the
door
these
stairs
are
steep
he
murmured
i
hardly
like
you
to
descend
them
unaided
but
if
you
insist
go
on
she
said
imperiously
down
he
went
and
after
him
she
came
following
the
way
he
led
her
down
the
long
stone
underground
ways
we
have
of
course
very
pleasant
stairs
down
to
our
water
gate
he
murmured
apologetically
but
since
you
prefer
this
way
really
not
the
way
that
i
would
have
chosen
to
have
you
first
explore
your
palace
madame
these
you
perceive
are
the
cellars
and
old
storerooms
i
do
not
want
you
to
talk
she
said
urgently
but
you
would
not
shoot
me
for
it
only
for
raising
an
alarm
and
surely
you
can
not
be
unreasonable
about
a
few
words
you
must
be
very
careful
here
this
doorway
is
low
it
was
not
past
the
old
ruined
mosque
included
in
the
underground
world
that
he
was
leading
her
but
down
a
narrow
branching
way
between
walls
so
low
that
the
general
head
was
bowed
in
caution
this
part
of
the
palace
is
very
old
he
murmured
over
his
shoulder
an
ancestor
of
mine
sharyar
the
wazir
raised
these
walls
during
the
wars
for
the
dispensing
of
that
sacred
duty
of
hospitality
which
allah
enjoins
upon
the
faithful
it
is
reported
that
he
was
host
here
to
fifty
of
the
enemy
during
their
remaining
lifetime
although
they
had
the
delicacy
not
to
cumber
him
with
overlong
living
it
is
not
as
i
said
a
pleasant
place
but
the
walls
are
strong
and
so
i
selected
a
spot
here
here
somewhere
then
in
these
grim
ruins
ryder
was
penned
helpless
and
questioning
the
the
girl
trembled
with
excitement
when
she
thought
of
his
joy
his
deliverance
and
at
her
hands
for
their
escape
she
had
no
plans
only
the
decision
to
thrust
the
gun
into
his
hands
and
follow
him
unquestioningly
perhaps
they
could
leave
the
general
in
his
place
and
he
could
wear
the
general
uniform
for
disguise
everything
was
possible
now
that
she
was
nearing
him
and
his
safety
was
at
hand
she
thrilled
with
a
reanimating
excitement
that
flew
its
scarlet
banners
in
her
cheeks
only
a
few
steps
now
go
on
she
said
breathlessly
the
bey
had
stopped
and
now
flashed
his
lantern
over
a
low
timbered
door
studded
with
ancient
nail
heads
in
a
design
whose
artistry
did
not
arrest
her
from
a
peg
beside
it
he
took
down
a
key
of
brass
fitted
it
to
the
lock
and
turned
it
with
a
deliberation
maddening
to
her
tense
nerves
her
heart
was
beating
as
if
it
would
burst
its
bounds
only
a
moment
or
two
he
had
trouble
with
that
door
it
took
his
shoulder
at
last
he
set
it
swinging
inward
slowly
on
its
creaking
hinges
then
he
stepped
back
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
invited
her
to
enter
not
a
chamber
of
luxury
you
understand
but
substantial
as
you
will
see
go
first
she
ordered
he
laughed
ever
distrustful
little
follow
then
and
he
stepped
within
into
the
darkness
which
his
failing
lantern
but
little
illumined
calling
out
in
a
louder
tone
in
his
halting
english
a
visitor
my
friend
a
tourist
of
the
subterranean
she
had
followed
him
to
the
threshold
seeing
nothing
in
the
blackness
but
the
seamed
blocks
of
stone
within
the
lantern
rays
afraid
always
to
turn
her
eyes
from
him
or
her
hand
from
its
outstretched
pointing
he
said
very
quickly
to
her
in
turkish
if
you
will
wait
by
the
door
the
floor
is
bad
and
there
is
another
lantern
here
on
the
wall
at
her
left
he
fumbled
along
the
stone
wall
she
heard
him
mutter
and
then
reach
and
then
she
did
not
know
what
was
happening
for
the
very
ground
on
which
she
stood
the
solid
block
of
stone
began
to
slip
swiftly
beneath
her
feet
she
staggered
and
felt
herself
falling
falling
into
some
precipitately
opened
abyss
she
gave
a
wild
scream
flinging
out
her
arms
in
terror
and
then
cold
waters
closed
above
her
and
the
scream
ended
in
a
gurgling
cry
it
was
no
great
distance
that
she
fell
what
the
dropped
stone
had
revealed
answering
the
signal
of
the
old
lever
in
the
wall
that
the
general
had
pressed
was
a
stone
well
narrow
deep
implanted
there
by
some
ingenious
lord
of
the
palace
in
days
for
the
subtle
elimination
of
friend
or
foe
or
rival
but
it
was
not
part
of
hamdi
plan
to
leave
the
young
girl
there
and
close
the
obliterating
stone
scarcely
had
the
waters
met
above
her
head
than
he
was
flinging
down
a
rope
ladder
whose
upper
ends
were
fastened
to
rings
in
the
floor
and
descending
this
with
swift
agility
until
the
waters
reached
his
waist
then
he
leaned
out
and
clutched
the
floating
satin
bubbling
and
ballooning
yet
unsubmerged
above
the
stagnant
depths
and
drew
it
towards
him
as
the
struggling
girl
came
gasping
within
his
reach
he
carried
her
panting
up
the
ladder
again
and
laid
her
down
in
the
darkness
while
he
drew
up
the
ladder
and
closed
the
stone
by
pressing
that
hidden
lever
but
the
stone
which
had
dropped
so
swiftly
was
slow
and
heavy
in
slipping
back
in
place
and
when
he
turned
again
to
aimée
she
had
ceased
her
choking
cough
and
was
sitting
up
thrusting
back
the
dripping
hair
from
her
black
eyes
staring
bewilderedly
about
the
gloom
as
murky
as
any
genie
cave
the
lantern
light
was
almost
out
in
its
expiring
gleams
she
saw
no
more
inky
water
but
only
the
damp
stones
on
which
a
pool
was
widening
from
her
wet
garments
and
the
figure
of
the
general
stooping
over
to
squeeze
the
streams
from
his
own
wet
clothes
the
nightmarish
horror
of
it
overwhelmed
her
for
a
moment
she
could
have
screamed
with
horror
and
then
she
felt
a
cold
and
terrible
despair
lay
its
paralyzing
hand
upon
her
heart
somewhere
she
felt
beneath
those
secret
stones
lay
ryder
drowned
and
she
was
living
in
her
helplessness
no
revolver
now
that
was
gone
in
the
water
perhaps
there
was
no
resource
now
no
refuge
strength
went
out
of
her
and
passive
in
a
dream
of
evil
darkness
she
felt
herself
being
hurried
stumblingly
back
through
the
secret
corridors
and
the
dark
halls
chapter
xvi
out
of
the
darkness
there
was
no
measure
of
time
for
ryder
in
that
walled
coffin
of
death
the
seconds
seemed
hours
the
minutes
ages
he
drew
quick
short
breaths
as
if
economizing
the
air
that
was
so
soon
to
fail
him
he
tugged
at
his
bonds
till
the
veins
rose
on
his
forehead
but
the
silk
held
and
the
confines
of
the
prison
permitted
him
no
room
for
struggle
then
he
leaned
forward
to
press
with
all
his
might
upon
the
bricks
before
him
he
grunted
he
sweated
with
the
agony
of
his
exertions
but
not
a
brick
was
stirred
not
a
crack
was
made
in
the
mortar
that
gripped
them
tighter
every
instant
he
died
a
thousand
deaths
in
the
horror
that
invaded
him
then
already
he
felt
strangling
and
the
painful
pumping
of
his
heart
seemed
the
beginning
of
the
end
cold
sweat
stood
out
all
over
him
it
ran
down
his
face
in
trickling
streams
and
his
body
was
drenched
with
that
clammy
dew
of
fear
he
tried
to
count
the
minutes
the
hours
to
estimate
how
long
he
would
hold
out
and
then
he
heard
his
own
voice
saying
very
distinctly
and
clearly
and
dispassionately
this
thing
is
absurd
it
was
absurd
it
was
idiotic
it
was
utterly
irrational
it
was
an
impossible
end
for
an
young
american
an
excavator
of
no
mean
attainments
a
young
scholar
and
explorer
of
twentieth
century
science
a
sane
modern
harmless
young
man
to
die
immured
in
the
ancient
walls
of
a
turkish
palace
because
he
had
invaded
a
marriage
reception
and
intervened
between
man
and
wife
violent
death
in
any
form
must
always
appear
absurd
to
the
young
and
energetic
and
the
fantastic
horror
of
his
death
removed
it
definitely
from
any
realm
of
possibility
the
thing
simply
could
not
happen
he
thought
of
the
amazement
and
the
incredulity
of
his
friends
dangers
in
plenty
they
had
warned
him
against
to
his
youthful
amusement
sand
storms
and
chills
and
raw
fruit
and
unboiled
waters
but
they
had
not
warned
him
against
veiled
women
and
the
resentments
of
outraged
lords
and
masters
he
thought
of
his
mother
consternation
and
dismay
he
thought
of
his
father
stern
amazement
what
an
awful
jolt
it
would
give
them
he
reflected
with
an
irrational
tickling
of
young
humor
but
no
it
would
not
they
would
never
know
not
a
word
of
this
fate
would
percolate
into
the
world
without
not
a
comment
upon
his
true
end
would
enliven
the
daily
columns
of
the
east
middleton
never
would
it
regret
the
tragic
and
romantic
interment
of
a
young
native
son
of
talent
buried
alive
by
a
revengeful
general
of
the
sultan
he
amused
himself
by
writing
the
paragraph
that
would
never
be
written
then
he
told
himself
that
he
was
lightheaded
and
hysterical
and
that
he
had
better
wonder
what
would
actually
be
written
what
explanation
would
be
found
a
desert
storm
perhaps
or
some
accident
mclean
would
poke
about
but
for
all
mclean
knew
he
might
be
on
his
way
back
to
camp
that
very
moment
and
sometimes
he
went
by
sailing
canoe
and
a
rented
horse
and
sometimes
by
the
accredited
steamer
and
a
camel
and
sometimes
by
tram
or
train
to
the
nearest
station
even
mind
and
mclean
copts
would
make
much
of
all
the
alternatives
that
his
unsettled
habits
had
afforded
was
there
any
possibility
of
his
being
traced
of
any
rescue
reaching
him
he
thought
hard
and
long
upon
his
last
free
moments
jinny
jeffries
knew
that
he
was
in
the
palace
and
jinny
had
been
reiteratedly
warned
about
the
danger
of
betraying
that
knowledge
it
would
take
some
little
time
for
alarm
before
jinny
said
anything
and
it
would
take
a
little
time
for
jinny
to
begin
to
worry
he
had
not
been
so
instant
in
attendance
upon
jinny
of
late
for
all
their
residence
in
the
same
hotel
that
she
would
suspect
that
his
absence
of
hours
was
due
to
actual
incarceration
his
cursed
passion
for
freedom
in
which
to
ramble
up
and
down
that
deserted
lane
without
tewfick
pasha
garden
his
inane
love
of
solitary
mooning
no
jinny
would
not
soon
wonder
about
him
she
had
not
expected
to
see
him
that
evening
anyway
he
had
muttered
something
to
her
about
a
man
and
an
engagement
she
rather
look
to
see
him
the
next
day
and
talk
about
their
adventure
but
still
she
would
feel
no
more
than
pique
at
his
absence
positive
worry
would
not
develop
until
later
besides
all
the
revelations
that
jinny
could
make
would
do
no
good
jinny
could
only
report
that
he
had
maintained
a
disguise
at
a
wedding
reception
and
talked
a
few
moments
apparently
undetected
to
a
bride
hamdi
bey
and
hamdi
eunuchs
would
be
blandly
ignorant
of
such
a
scandal
what
his
disappearance
would
indicate
would
be
some
further
frolic
on
his
part
some
tempting
of
a
later
providence
before
he
had
abandoned
his
disguise
if
he
were
discovered
for
instance
in
some
of
those
native
quarters
behind
a
woman
veil
decidedly
the
only
effect
of
jinny
revelations
would
be
an
unsavory
cloud
upon
his
character
there
was
no
hope
to
be
looked
for
and
yet
he
could
not
believe
it
there
were
moments
when
the
black
terror
mastered
him
but
involuntarily
his
young
strength
shook
it
off
he
could
not
believe
in
its
reality
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
actually
here
bricked
and
bound
in
this
infernal
coffin
but
indisputably
the
evidence
was
in
favor
of
belief
only
to
believe
was
to
feel
again
that
horror
he
tried
to
tell
himself
that
it
did
matter
one
had
to
die
some
time
everybody
did
one
might
as
well
go
out
young
and
strong
and
still
interested
in
life
but
that
was
remarkably
cold
comfort
he
did
want
to
go
out
at
all
he
did
want
to
die
not
for
fifty
or
sixty
years
yet
and
of
all
the
ways
of
dying
he
wanted
least
to
smother
and
choke
and
stifle
like
a
rat
walled
in
its
hole
in
the
wall
he
recalled
with
peculiar
pain
a
woodchuck
that
he
had
penned
up
as
a
boy
and
he
hoped
with
extraordinary
passion
that
the
poor
beast
had
made
another
hole
never
again
he
resolved
would
he
pen
up
a
living
creature
never
again
if
only
again
he
could
see
the
light
of
day
and
breathe
the
free
air
he
thought
of
aimée
and
when
he
thought
of
her
his
heart
seemed
to
turn
to
water
useless
to
repeat
to
himself
now
those
old
reminders
that
he
had
seen
her
so
little
known
her
so
slightly
useless
to
measure
that
strange
feeling
that
drew
him
by
any
artifice
of
time
and
acquaintance
she
was
aimée
she
was
enchantment
and
delight
she
was
appeal
and
tenderness
she
was
blind
longing
and
mystery
she
was
beauty
and
desire
even
to
think
of
her
now
in
the
infernal
horror
of
this
cramping
grave
was
to
feel
his
heart
quicken
and
his
blood
grow
hot
in
a
helpless
passion
of
dread
and
fear
she
was
alone
there
helpless
with
that
madman
he
tried
to
tell
himself
that
she
was
not
wholly
helpless
that
she
had
wit
and
spirit
and
courage
and
that
somehow
she
would
manage
to
quell
the
storm
she
might
persuade
hamdi
to
their
story
make
him
remember
that
this
was
the
twentieth
century
wherein
one
does
not
go
about
immuring
inconvenient
trespassers
as
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
mad
khedive
years
which
had
probably
formed
the
impulses
but
in
telling
himself
this
there
was
no
comfort
for
the
thought
of
the
price
that
aimée
would
have
to
pay
it
was
pleasanter
to
pretend
that
hamdi
was
really
only
joking
in
a
shockingly
exaggerated
practical
way
and
that
presently
when
the
suitable
time
had
elapsed
he
would
present
himself
smiling
to
end
the
ghastly
antiquated
jest
for
some
time
he
continued
to
tell
himself
that
and
then
suddenly
he
told
himself
that
the
time
for
intervention
had
surely
come
it
was
very
hard
to
breathe
the
next
minute
he
was
assuring
himself
that
this
was
merely
some
devil
trick
of
his
apprehensive
imagination
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
air
left
but
he
was
distressingly
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
air
and
his
calculations
were
lamentably
unsupported
by
any
sound
basis
of
fact
mistake
not
to
have
gone
in
for
chemistry
and
physics
a
chap
done
time
in
those
subjects
would
now
be
rocking
with
suspense
he
comfortably
and
satisfactorily
know
just
how
many
hours
minutes
and
seconds
were
allotted
before
his
finish
and
he
could
think
his
thoughts
accordingly
undoubtedly
so
he
insisted
to
himself
there
was
air
enough
here
to
last
him
till
morning
this
gasping
stuff
was
all
imagination
he
wanted
to
keep
cool
and
quiet
but
for
all
his
reassurance
there
something
a
little
queer
with
his
lungs
and
his
heart
was
lurching
sickeningly
in
his
side
like
a
runaway
ship
engine
and
then
he
heard
his
own
voice
repeating
very
tonelessly
o
god
o
god
and
the
horror
of
it
all
came
blackly
over
him
and
a
feeling
of
profound
and
awful
sickness
it
a
sound
the
faintest
scraping
and
knocking
without
that
wall
it
went
through
him
like
an
electric
current
and
then
a
roar
burst
from
him
that
fairly
split
his
ears
the
reaction
of
his
quivered
nerves
and
racking
fears
of
his
uncertainties
his
tightening
terrors
but
now
nothing
he
could
not
hear
a
thing
a
delusion
a
torture
of
his
final
hours
no
it
came
again
more
definitely
now
a
little
grinding
and
scraping
faster
and
faster
a
muffled
driving
thud
a
jubilant
reassurance
sang
gayly
through
him
he
had
expected
this
this
was
what
he
had
predicted
hamdi
was
no
foul
friend
he
was
a
devilish
uncomfortable
customer
with
antiquated
notions
of
revenge
but
now
he
had
shot
his
wad
and
was
going
to
undo
his
tricks
ryder
braced
himself
to
present
a
carefree
jauntiness
an
air
somewhat
difficult
to
assume
when
one
is
trussed
like
a
spitted
bird
in
a
hot
coffin
space
with
hair
falling
dankly
over
a
steaming
brow
with
a
collar
like
a
string
and
an
indescribable
pallor
beneath
the
bronze
of
one
face
something
stirred
one
end
of
a
brick
was
driven
in
against
his
chest
then
he
felt
the
blind
working
of
some
tool
that
caught
it
and
worried
it
free
it
seemed
to
him
that
through
that
dark
aperture
a
current
of
cold
delicious
air
came
rushing
in
about
him
the
blows
sounded
against
the
adjoining
bricks
and
he
thought
of
the
glorious
joy
of
seeing
out
again
feeling
that
he
would
welcome
even
the
sight
of
blond
mustache
and
the
eunuch
hideous
grin
now
the
aperture
admitted
a
pale
gleam
upon
his
chest
staring
steadily
down
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fingers
curving
about
a
brick
and
his
heart
that
had
steadied
began
to
race
again
wildly
for
they
were
not
the
fingers
of
the
black
nor
yet
the
wiry
joints
of
the
general
they
were
soft
white
fingers
with
a
gleam
of
rings
aimée
somehow
somewhere
she
had
managed
to
come
to
him
to
achieve
this
rescue
aimée
he
breathed
the
name
came
a
warning
little
whisper
and
impatiently
he
waited
until
that
opening
should
be
greater
and
permit
of
sight
and
speech
his
helplessness
was
maddening
if
only
he
could
raise
his
hands
could
get
those
bonds
off
he
twisted
he
writhed
he
tried
to
lift
his
elbows
and
get
his
wrists
in
reach
of
the
opening
but
the
coffin
was
too
diabolically
cramped
for
movement
until
the
hole
was
very
much
larger
then
with
a
convulsive
pressure
he
swung
his
wrists
within
reach
and
after
a
moment
wait
he
felt
a
thin
blade
drawn
across
the
silk
the
relief
was
glorious
he
swung
his
hands
free
rubbing
the
chafed
wrists
then
thrust
an
opened
hand
out
into
the
opening
and
with
instant
comprehension
a
short
pointed
bit
of
iron
was
put
within
it
now
he
could
do
something
with
furious
strength
he
attacked
the
bricks
edging
the
hole
and
as
he
pried
free
each
brick
he
could
again
get
a
glimpse
of
those
white
delicate
fingers
lifting
it
carefully
away
and
now
the
hole
was
large
enough
he
twisted
about
and
thrust
out
a
leg
and
then
with
a
feeling
of
ecstasy
which
made
the
official
literary
raptures
of
saints
and
conquerors
but
pale
dim
moods
he
wormed
his
way
out
of
that
jagged
hole
and
turned
erect
and
free
to
the
shrouded
figure
of
his
rescuer
she
had
drawn
back
a
little
against
the
wall
a
gauzy
veil
across
her
face
beside
her
upon
the
stone
floor
a
solitary
candle
sent
its
flickering
rays
into
the
shadows
edging
with
light
her
slender
outlines
ryder
took
one
quick
step
to
her
his
heart
in
his
throat
and
put
out
eager
arms
but
in
the
very
moment
that
he
was
gathering
her
to
him
even
when
he
felt
her
pliant
body
at
first
resistant
then
softly
yielding
swept
against
his
own
he
felt
too
a
little
palm
suddenly
upon
his
mouth
hsh
said
the
soft
whispering
voice
cutting
into
his
low
murmur
of
aimée
and
then
in
slow
emphatic
caution
be
careful
he
had
need
of
that
caution
for
under
the
saffron
veil
was
not
the
face
of
aimée
he
was
clasping
a
young
creature
that
he
had
never
seen
before
a
girl
with
flaming
henna
hair
and
kohl
darkened
brows
a
vivid
blazoning
face
that
smiled
enigmatically
with
a
certain
mockery
of
delight
at
the
amazement
he
reflected
so
unguardedly
chapter
xvii
aziza
from
the
slackening
grip
of
his
astounded
arms
she
stepped
backward
still
smiling
faintly
and
holding
up
in
admonishment
the
palm
she
had
pressed
against
his
mouth
but
what
what
the
dev
muttered
ryder
she
nodded
mysteriously
and
beckoned
come
she
whispered
catching
up
her
candle
and
after
holding
it
high
for
a
moment
staring
at
him
she
extinguished
it
suddenly
and
turned
to
lead
the
cautious
way
across
the
stone
spaces
while
ryder
closely
followed
not
aimée
then
but
some
messenger
he
could
only
suppose
some
confidante
at
need
a
handmaid
the
whisper
of
her
silks
the
remembered
gleam
of
jewels
in
the
henna
hair
flouted
that
thought
and
not
troubling
his
ingenuity
with
alternatives
he
was
content
to
follow
her
swift
steps
they
were
now
in
those
open
rubbishy
spaces
where
he
remembered
the
crumbling
masonry
and
broken
arches
of
old
disregarded
mosques
now
they
were
again
enclosed
in
narrow
stone
walls
winding
past
cellars
and
store
rooms
the
girl
advance
grew
more
cautious
often
she
stopped
and
listened
peering
ahead
into
the
darkness
and
now
as
she
took
another
turning
her
care
redoubled
and
ryder
needed
no
exhortation
to
imitate
it
obeying
a
gesture
of
her
arm
he
followed
at
a
greater
distance
prepared
at
the
warning
of
a
sound
to
flatten
himself
against
the
wall
or
dart
into
some
cranny
of
retreat
they
were
now
in
the
cellars
the
corridor
was
widening
out
before
them
with
a
pallid
showing
of
light
crossed
with
many
bars
at
some
far
end
they
stole
towards
it
it
was
a
window
or
barred
gate
he
saw
and
he
heard
again
that
lapping
of
restless
water
against
stone
he
could
see
too
in
the
dimness
the
curve
of
a
stair
near
the
gate
abruptly
his
guide
checked
him
wary
and
noiseless
he
waited
while
she
stole
forward
to
those
stairs
peering
up
into
the
gloom
attentive
for
any
sound
from
above
apparently
satisfied
she
went
on
towards
the
barred
gate
and
bent
down
over
a
spot
of
darkness
which
ryder
had
taken
for
a
shadow
he
saw
now
that
it
had
some
semblance
to
a
human
outline
closely
the
girl
bent
and
he
caught
the
pallor
of
her
hands
searching
swiftly
and
then
a
muffled
clink
next
moment
a
wraith
with
soundless
steps
she
was
back
at
his
side
again
urging
him
on
with
her
they
passed
the
stairs
he
felt
the
soft
yield
of
carpet
beneath
his
feet
they
passed
that
recumbent
figure
and
now
he
heard
the
rhythm
of
a
sleeper
heavy
breath
escaping
muffledly
from
the
folds
of
a
thick
mantle
which
the
sleeper
habits
had
wrapped
about
his
head
for
all
the
mantle
he
was
aware
of
the
fumes
of
wine
i
saw
that
had
his
drink
said
the
girl
suddenly
in
softly
whispered
turkish
her
head
close
to
his
he
is
my
friend
i
do
not
neglect
him
and
under
her
breath
she
laughed
as
she
exhibited
the
great
bunch
of
keys
she
had
taken
from
the
imbiber
stooping
now
before
the
gate
she
fitted
the
key
into
the
lock
then
over
her
shoulder
she
looked
up
at
the
young
man
and
asked
him
a
quick
question
he
did
not
understand
that
was
the
trouble
with
his
vernacular
it
would
go
on
very
well
for
a
time
when
he
had
a
clue
to
the
sense
or
when
it
was
a
question
of
every
day
expression
but
a
sudden
divergence
an
unexpected
word
was
apt
to
prove
a
hopeless
obstacle
now
she
repeated
her
question
again
more
slowly
and
again
he
shook
his
head
now
she
stood
up
frowning
a
little
and
began
again
in
english
you
no
i
not
know
this
way
you
do
it
a
sudden
smile
broke
over
her
face
as
she
made
a
swift
pushing
gesture
with
her
hands
that
with
her
pointing
to
the
water
outside
sent
ryder
a
sudden
enlightenment
swim
you
mean
do
i
swim
she
nodded
not
go
she
made
a
swift
downward
movement
of
her
hands
and
then
pointed
again
to
that
water
just
outside
the
gate
not
go
down
not
sink
interpreted
ryder
no
indeed
i
can
swim
he
assured
her
and
revisited
with
smiling
satisfaction
she
knelt
again
before
the
barred
gate
open
it
swung
with
so
sharp
a
crack
that
both
glanced
at
the
figure
behind
them
and
then
at
the
shadowy
gloom
of
the
stairs
but
no
alarm
sounded
outside
the
gate
ryder
saw
the
darkness
of
fairly
wide
rippling
waters
visited
with
floating
stars
and
beyond
a
dun
bank
escape
was
there
freedom
safety
he
felt
an
exultant
longing
to
plunge
in
and
strike
out
but
he
turned
questioningly
to
the
mysterious
rescuer
aimée
he
asked
under
his
breath
where
is
she
he
repeated
it
in
the
vernacular
distrusting
her
english
and
in
the
vernacular
she
answered
you
want
her
you
want
to
take
her
away
with
you
she
laughed
softly
at
the
quick
flash
in
his
eyes
and
hardly
waited
for
his
speech
good
what
a
lover
you
are
not
afraid
mendaciously
he
assured
her
that
he
was
not
good
she
said
again
with
a
showing
of
white
teeth
between
her
carmined
lips
you
take
her
you
take
her
away
from
him
that
is
what
i
want
you
understand
very
suddenly
he
understood
chapter
xviii
aziza
is
offended
this
was
no
emissary
from
aimée
this
was
no
philanthropic
bystander
it
was
some
girl
of
the
palace
jealous
and
daring
conspiring
shrewdly
for
the
removal
of
her
rival
take
her
away
she
was
saying
urgently
out
of
this
palace
we
want
no
brides
here
lowering
and
sullen
she
turned
bitter
on
the
word
i
was
watching
she
went
on
swiftly
i
heard
the
noise
and
then
the
whispering
the
darkness
has
ears
and
eyes
and
a
tongue
and
so
i
waited
out
there
he
could
not
distinguish
all
the
quick
flow
of
her
speech
but
he
caught
enough
to
understand
how
she
had
lurked
in
the
halls
jealously
spying
defying
the
eunuchs
authority
and
how
she
had
caught
with
passionate
delight
that
stifled
alarm
of
scandal
later
hanging
over
some
banister
she
had
seen
the
ethiopian
pass
with
his
burden
and
had
stolen
down
afterwards
stalking
like
a
cat
and
had
discovered
the
lantern
gone
the
door
unlocked
and
then
she
had
watched
until
the
pair
emerged
without
the
burden
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
hold
of
the
key
to
the
door
but
she
had
resolved
to
explore
and
so
she
had
furnished
the
waterman
with
his
wine
drugged
ryder
gathered
and
so
stolen
past
him
on
the
other
route
to
those
underground
foundations
to
which
her
suspicions
had
been
directed
by
the
mortar
and
dust
upon
yussuf
evidently
she
knew
the
possibilities
of
the
place
and
the
mind
of
its
master
and
when
she
found
the
old
niche
freshly
bricked
and
the
mortar
at
hand
she
had
not
needed
more
to
assure
her
that
here
was
the
burial
place
of
her
rival
lover
now
for
the
boon
of
his
life
he
was
to
relieve
her
of
that
rival
or
try
to
for
once
he
might
not
kill
her
she
whispered
but
if
again
her
eyes
glowed
like
a
cat
in
the
dark
take
her
away
make
her
name
a
spitting
and
a
disgrace
her
memory
a
shame
and
a
sting
is
she
beautiful
she
broke
off
to
demand
they
say
but
slaves
lie
can
you
believe
a
lover
he
said
whimsically
for
all
his
impatience
she
is
a
pearl
a
rose
a
crescent
moon
they
say
she
is
very
pale
and
thin
she
is
an
houri
from
paradise
he
said
distinctly
and
now
in
the
name
of
allah
let
me
get
to
her
tell
me
the
way
will
she
go
gladly
with
you
the
low
insistent
voice
went
on
and
at
his
quick
nod
holy
prophet
what
a
bride
she
clapped
her
two
ringed
hands
to
smother
the
impish
joy
of
her
laugh
a
warning
to
those
who
can
be
warned
he
will
not
be
so
eager
for
another
stripe
from
that
same
stick
it
was
his
cousin
seniha
hanum
satan
devour
her
who
made
this
marriage
always
she
hated
me
but
now
i
will
tell
you
how
to
get
to
her
look
out
with
me
kneeling
at
the
gate
over
the
dark
flow
of
the
water
she
drew
him
down
beside
her
and
thrusting
out
her
veiled
head
she
pointed
upward
and
to
the
right
to
a
jutting
balcony
of
mashrubiyeh
where
a
pale
light
showed
through
the
fretwork
there
you
see
that
is
my
room
and
if
you
climb
up
i
can
let
you
in
there
up
she
repeated
in
english
resolved
to
make
certain
i
see
i
can
get
there
he
assured
her
measuring
with
his
eye
the
dim
distance
at
once
she
said
i
will
be
there
i
can
not
take
you
with
me
through
the
upper
hall
it
is
dangerous
even
for
me
to
be
caught
but
no
eunuch
wants
my
displeasure
he
could
believe
it
watching
the
subtle
malicious
daring
of
her
face
even
in
the
gloom
he
caught
the
arrogance
of
her
eyes
and
the
bold
insolence
of
a
high
cheek
bone
she
had
a
hint
of
gypsy
and
you
can
get
me
in
you
a
wonder
he
whispered
i
thank
you
enough
rid
me
of
her
said
the
girl
swiftly
but
not
not
him
you
must
swear
what
is
it
that
christians
swear
by
she
broke
off
to
demand
by
the
grave
of
your
father
yes
you
will
swear
not
to
hurt
him
to
hurt
hamdi
by
the
grave
of
your
father
yes
ryder
nodded
quickly
his
father
to
be
sure
was
in
no
grave
at
all
he
was
allowing
hastily
for
the
difference
in
time
in
his
treasurer
cage
at
the
bank
in
east
middleton
but
he
did
not
wait
to
explain
this
to
the
girl
i
swear
it
he
repeated
i
wo
hurt
your
hamdi
since
your
condition
but
we
wasting
time
up
then
and
if
you
fall
down
do
like
this
smiling
mischievously
she
made
the
gesture
of
swimming
allah
go
with
thee
and
with
me
also
he
heard
her
murmur
as
he
stepped
out
to
the
ledge
of
the
entrance
twisted
himself
agilely
about
and
climbing
up
the
opened
gate
swung
himself
up
to
the
stone
carving
overhead
below
him
he
heard
the
gate
swing
shut
he
did
not
hear
her
lock
it
fervently
he
hoped
she
had
not
since
it
was
a
possible
exit
for
any
one
in
a
hurry
but
at
any
rate
he
need
not
worry
about
a
way
out
of
the
place
until
he
had
got
into
it
again
and
the
getting
in
was
not
any
too
simple
it
was
work
for
a
mountain
goat
he
reflected
after
a
short
interval
devoted
to
tentative
reaches
and
balancing
and
digging
in
of
hands
and
feet
the
distances
were
far
greater
than
the
foreshortened
perspective
had
allowed
him
to
guess
and
there
was
only
the
starlight
to
illumine
the
gray
face
of
the
palace
he
had
no
idea
of
the
time
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
the
night
or
early
morning
he
judged
vaguely
by
the
stars
although
it
seemed
impossible
that
so
few
hours
had
passed
the
river
was
all
silence
and
darkness
no
nuggars
with
their
sleeping
crews
were
moored
below
he
seemed
the
only
living
breathing
thing
clambering
across
the
face
of
time
and
space
gingerly
he
kicked
off
the
nondescript
black
shoes
he
had
worn
with
his
disguise
that
afternoon
and
essayed
a
perilous
toehold
while
he
reached
for
the
interstices
of
a
mashrubiyeh
window
just
overhead
once
gripping
the
rounds
he
pulled
himself
up
reflecting
that
it
was
well
it
was
night
and
that
no
lady
was
sitting
within
her
shelter
to
be
affrighted
at
this
intrusion
of
fingers
and
toes
from
the
jutting
top
of
this
projection
he
surveyed
his
further
field
of
operation
the
window
with
a
light
was
two
stories
higher
yet
and
to
the
right
there
were
two
other
windows
with
lights
on
the
second
story
very
much
farther
along
and
he
wondered
painfully
if
these
were
the
rooms
of
aimée
that
boudoir
in
which
he
had
hidden
through
the
end
of
the
long
reception
had
been
upon
the
water
and
there
had
been
a
door
into
an
adjoining
room
for
he
had
seen
a
attendant
passing
in
and
out
a
wild
longing
seized
him
to
crawl
on
and
over
into
those
windows
but
it
was
a
difficult
almost
an
impossible
distance
and
even
when
there
he
would
be
like
a
fly
on
the
outside
of
a
pane
with
no
way
of
getting
in
the
unknown
girl
had
promised
him
a
way
through
her
window
and
he
had
confidence
in
her
ingenuity
and
daring
so
he
went
on
worming
cautiously
along
old
gutters
and
ledges
and
jutting
balconies
until
at
last
he
was
clasping
the
lower
grill
of
that
mashrubiyeh
from
which
her
light
gleamed
instantly
the
light
went
out
wait
he
heard
her
voice
say
sharply
over
his
head
she
was
standing
by
the
window
fumbling
with
the
woodwork
and
in
a
moment
he
heard
the
click
of
a
knob
and
then
just
opposite
his
head
the
screening
grill
slipped
aside
and
an
aperture
appeared
quick
admonished
the
voice
and
quickly
indeed
he
drew
himself
up
and
in
reflecting
whimsically
as
he
did
so
that
this
girl
had
first
helped
him
out
of
a
hole
and
then
into
one
the
next
moment
she
had
moved
the
grill
into
place
and
lifted
the
cover
she
had
placed
over
her
triplet
of
candles
on
a
stand
triumphant
her
eyes
dancing
her
teeth
a
gleam
of
light
between
those
scarlet
lips
of
hers
she
looked
at
him
for
the
admiration
she
saw
twinkling
back
at
her
in
his
eyes
but
not
me
no
she
protested
her
supple
hands
gesturing
towards
the
magic
casement
i
found
it
here
it
is
very
old
you
understand
some
other
long
ago
found
time
dull
and
so
delightedly
she
shared
the
flavor
of
that
secret
of
the
vagabond
lady
of
long
ago
who
had
devised
this
cunning
entrance
for
her
lover
on
some
dark
night
like
this
with
the
gatekeeper
drowsy
with
old
wine
some
other
stripling
had
climbed
that
worn
façade
before
him
and
slipped
through
the
secret
space
and
stood
triumphantly
before
some
daring
laughing
girl
who
had
cast
aside
for
him
her
veil
and
her
fear
of
death
what
ingenuity
ryder
wondered
fleetly
had
smuggled
in
the
carpenter
for
the
contrivance
what
jewels
had
gone
to
the
bribing
what
lies
had
been
told
and
what
had
been
the
end
of
it
all
evidently
not
the
discovery
of
the
opening
he
hoped
with
singular
intensity
for
the
safety
of
the
daring
young
lovers
that
unknown
youth
whose
feet
had
foreworn
the
path
for
his
feet
and
that
dead
and
gone
young
girl
who
had
dared
anything
rather
than
endure
the
mortal
ennui
of
those
hours
behind
the
veil
these
thoughts
all
went
through
him
like
one
thought
as
he
stood
there
his
eyes
roving
about
the
dim
shadowy
room
of
old
divans
and
eastern
hangings
and
then
turning
back
to
the
glimmering
figure
of
its
mistress
she
was
staring
frankly
at
him
her
eyes
boldly
curious
and
examining
they
were
not
dark
eyes
he
saw
now
that
had
been
the
impression
given
by
the
kohl
about
them
and
the
black
line
of
the
brows
penciled
into
one
line
they
were
yellow
eyes
golden
and
glowing
scornful
and
as
she
looked
at
him
these
eyes
smiled
slowly
she
was
seeing
in
this
lover
of
her
rival
a
singularly
delightful
looking
young
man
for
all
his
dust
and
disarray
a
slender
bronzed
young
man
with
dark
disordered
hair
straying
across
a
white
brow
and
audacious
eager
eyes
in
which
the
fear
of
death
so
lately
glimpsed
had
left
no
daunting
reflection
slowly
she
lifted
her
hand
and
with
deliberate
softness
put
back
that
straying
hair
of
his
poor
boy
she
said
slowly
in
english
and
then
smiling
ruefully
she
held
out
her
hands
for
his
inspection
the
grime
of
the
bricks
had
discolored
their
scented
delicacy
and
he
saw
bruised
finger
tips
and
a
torn
nail
i
infernally
sorry
he
said
quickly
her
smile
deepened
at
his
look
of
concern
as
he
held
a
little
helplessly
the
witnesses
of
her
work
of
rescue
which
seemed
somehow
to
stray
into
his
keeping
it
is
nothing
but
you
poor
boy
she
said
again
in
that
english
of
which
she
seemed
naïvely
proud
if
you
could
give
me
some
water
he
suggested
and
drank
deep
with
delight
the
last
drop
she
brought
him
from
an
earthen
jar
it
seemed
to
wash
from
his
throat
the
taste
of
that
dust
and
fear
i
ca
begin
to
thank
you
he
murmured
i
only
wish
that
i
could
do
something
for
you
she
looked
up
at
him
they
were
standing
close
together
their
voices
cautiously
low
perhaps
yes
you
can
it
not
doing
anything
for
you
to
save
aimée
he
told
her
that
what
you
are
doing
for
her
and
for
me
but
if
ever
you
want
me
for
anything
after
this
my
name
is
ryder
jack
ryder
and
you
can
reach
me
at
the
agricultural
bank
he
had
a
vague
vision
of
some
day
repaying
his
enormous
debt
by
assisting
this
girl
grown
tired
of
her
hamdi
out
of
this
aperture
and
into
a
waiting
boat
he
would
do
it
like
a
shot
he
told
himself
gladly
he
would
do
anything
on
god
green
earth
if
only
she
helped
him
get
aimée
away
from
that
infernal
villain
jack
she
repeated
under
her
breath
and
then
in
her
slow
english
i
like
jack
do
forget
it
i
always
come
and
do
anything
for
you
and
if
you
tell
me
your
name
aziza
aziza
i
never
forget
that
and
now
if
you
tell
me
how
i
can
get
to
her
and
then
the
best
way
out
why
you
so
hurry
why
he
looked
a
little
blank
i
ca
lose
a
minute
he
may
be
with
her
she
came
a
little
nearer
to
him
her
head
tilting
back
with
a
slow
indolent
challenge
gone
was
the
silken
mantle
that
had
been
about
her
below
stairs
and
he
saw
now
that
she
was
a
vivid
exotic
shimmer
of
gauzy
green
against
the
saffron
veil
that
fell
from
her
henna
hair
there
was
barbaric
beauty
in
her
in
the
bold
painted
face
the
bare
arms
the
slender
sinuous
lines
and
there
was
barbaric
splendor
in
the
heavy
jewels
that
winked
and
flashed
it
struck
ryder
that
she
was
gotten
up
regardless
in
pride
perhaps
on
her
rival
wedding
night
or
had
there
been
some
defiant
desperate
design
upon
hamdi
she
did
not
miss
that
sudden
prolonging
of
his
look
upon
her
you
like
me
yes
she
murmured
and
then
slipping
back
into
the
vernacular
i
i
am
not
the
stupid
veiled
girl
of
the
seclusion
not
forever
i
come
from
the
west
the
deserts
i
have
seen
the
world
men
men
i
know
i
danced
before
them
not
the
dances
of
the
cairene
cafés
she
uttered
with
swift
scorn
but
the
dance
of
the
two
swords
the
dance
of
the
serpents
men
threw
the
gold
from
their
turbans
about
my
feet
when
i
had
danced
to
them
and
others
english
french
she
broke
off
but
her
eyes
told
many
things
then
hamdi
she
said
slowly
him
i
ruled
and
his
palace
but
i
have
known
other
things
closer
yet
she
came
to
him
her
eyes
golden
fires
of
eyes
were
smiling
up
into
his
her
scarlet
lips
gathered
in
soft
sensual
curves
her
whole
silken
scented
body
seemed
to
slip
into
his
embrace
a
bare
arm
touched
his
neck
resting
heavily
sweet
heart
she
said
slowly
in
her
difficult
english
it
was
the
deuce
of
a
position
no
man
can
rudely
snatch
from
his
neck
the
arm
of
the
lady
who
has
just
saved
him
from
a
harrowing
death
and
a
lady
who
was
risking
more
than
her
life
in
sheltering
him
decidedly
the
situation
was
delicate
it
was
not
the
lady
fault
that
her
impetuosity
the
impetuosity
which
had
been
his
salvation
now
plunged
her
into
amorous
caprice
there
were
obvious
handicaps
moral
social
and
ethical
in
her
upbringing
she
was
a
child
of
nature
a
nature
undisciplined
unruly
tempestuous
and
even
queening
over
hamdi
and
his
palace
must
have
offered
little
diversion
to
a
wild
dancing
girl
familiar
with
the
excitement
of
more
varied
conquest
ryder
was
horribly
embarrassed
he
was
visited
with
a
fearful
constraint
a
chivalrous
wish
not
to
hurt
her
feelings
and
a
sharp
prevision
of
the
danger
of
offending
her
he
took
the
first
turn
of
least
resistance
he
did
not
need
to
bend
his
head
their
eyes
were
on
a
level
he
simply
kissed
her
and
she
kissed
him
back
he
hated
himself
for
the
leap
of
his
blood
and
for
the
puritanical
discomfort
of
his
nature
her
arm
about
his
neck
was
pressing
closer
it
was
the
moment
for
action
and
ryder
acted
very
firmly
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
hand
withdrew
it
from
its
clasp
about
him
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
his
kiss
was
respectful
gratitude
and
an
abdication
of
the
delights
of
dalliance
my
dear
he
murmured
now
if
you
will
show
me
the
way
out
her
eyes
agleam
between
lids
she
studied
him
it
occurred
to
ryder
that
probably
never
before
had
her
hands
been
detached
and
kissed
and
put
away
he
must
be
a
phenomenon
an
enigma
then
her
lips
parted
in
a
faintly
scornful
smile
you
afraid
you
you
want
run
i
horribly
afraid
he
said
earnestly
i
want
to
get
out
of
here
as
quick
as
i
can
that
was
putting
he
considered
the
very
wisest
construction
upon
it
negligently
her
gesture
reminded
him
of
the
opening
in
the
window
here
you
are
safe
she
murmured
in
the
vernacular
and
the
doors
are
locked
yes
but
but
aimée
is
safe
you
know
and
i
must
get
her
out
of
here
aimée
in
those
yellow
eyes
he
caught
the
flash
of
capricious
resentment
at
the
reminder
then
indifferently
she
brushed
the
distraction
away
there
is
time
enough
for
aimée
she
is
not
lonely
now
not
lonely
he
shivered
at
the
cold
carelessness
of
her
tone
i
must
get
to
her
quickly
then
but
that
is
not
safe
a
little
later
uncomfortably
he
tried
to
infuse
his
glance
with
innate
innocence
and
utter
lack
of
understanding
i
sha
hurt
him
if
i
have
the
chance
he
told
her
i
given
you
my
word
and
i
trust
you
much
her
gaze
sought
his
in
a
trifle
of
impatience
at
such
simplicity
but
it
is
not
safe
for
you
now
later
by
and
by
you
do
want
him
to
have
a
chance
to
make
love
to
her
do
you
said
ryder
sharply
i
thought
that
was
the
very
thing
you
her
smile
was
a
subtle
confessing
caress
i
shall
have
my
revenge
she
murmured
and
pressed
closer
to
him
again
every
sensuous
sumptuous
line
of
her
a
challenge
and
an
enticement
i
give
you
life
she
whispered
very
low
in
her
throat
you
give
me
perhaps
an
hour
i
an
hour
said
ryder
very
desperately
and
unhappily
not
when
aimée
is
with
that
devil
it
took
every
thought
of
aimée
to
get
the
words
out
he
felt
a
brute
about
it
a
low
ungrateful
dog
she
given
him
life
and
every
fiber
in
him
clamored
to
save
her
pride
and
champion
her
caprice
it
seemed
so
dastardly
to
wrench
away
from
her
now
like
some
joseph
leaving
that
beastly
stab
in
her
vanity
and
she
was
a
stunning
creature
lawless
elemental
hot
and
cold
like
the
seventh
wind
of
the
inferno
but
it
was
aimée
who
was
in
his
blood
like
a
fever
aimée
that
frail
white
rose
of
a
girl
in
her
bonds
of
terror
he
saw
the
flame
in
aziza
eyes
he
saw
the
stiffening
of
her
defiance
of
affront
then
her
form
drawn
up
her
bared
arms
outflung
her
vivid
painted
furious
face
challenging
him
i
am
not
beautiful
like
aimée
she
said
in
a
voice
of
venom
and
in
the
english
for
double
measure
you
not
like
me
no
you
beautiful
and
i
like
you
ryder
combated
feeling
a
bungling
fool
and
then
went
on
to
thrust
into
that
of
suspended
fury
a
faint
breath
of
appeasing
but
do
you
see
it
my
duty
you
go
she
said
clearly
even
in
that
moment
he
had
a
sharp
prescience
of
the
unwisdom
of
his
rejection
a
cold
calculator
of
chance
and
probabilities
would
have
reckoned
that
a
half
hour
of
assuagement
here
would
have
been
a
wiser
investment
of
his
mortal
moments
than
any
virtuous
plunge
into
duty
but
ryder
did
not
calculate
he
could
not
with
aimée
under
that
beast
hand
his
heart
and
soul
were
possessed
with
her
danger
and
his
heart
and
soul
carried
his
body
instinctively
back
from
the
dancing
girl
advance
and
he
whispered
i
must
go
there
is
no
time
she
flung
back
her
head
with
a
gesture
of
intolerable
rage
her
eyes
were
lightnings
dog
of
a
christian
she
said
chokingly
and
flew
to
the
doors
back
she
thrust
the
heavy
hangings
turning
a
quick
key
in
the
lock
and
wrenching
the
door
wide
and
before
ryder
could
understand
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
realize
that
she
was
not
simply
violently
expelling
him
from
her
room
she
gave
a
shriek
that
rang
wildly
down
the
corridors
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
with
one
hand
out
to
thrust
him
back
or
cling
to
him
if
he
attempted
to
pass
she
shrieked
again
and
again
instantly
there
came
a
running
of
feet
chapter
xix
an
interruption
when
hamdi
bey
had
taken
aimée
back
to
her
apartments
he
pulled
sharply
upon
a
bellcord
in
a
few
moments
the
slave
woman
fatima
made
her
appearance
no
old
crone
like
miriam
but
a
sallow
creature
with
an
old
disfiguring
scar
across
a
cheek
the
general
pointed
to
the
wet
and
fainting
girl
huddling
weakly
upon
the
divan
your
new
mistress
has
met
with
an
accident
out
boating
a
curse
upon
me
for
gratifying
forbidden
caprice
he
said
crisply
be
silent
of
this
and
array
her
quickly
in
garments
of
rest
i
will
return
very
hurriedly
he
took
himself
and
his
own
wet
condition
away
he
was
furious
through
and
through
what
a
night
what
a
wedding
night
scandal
and
frustration
a
bride
with
a
desperate
lover
a
bride
who
herself
drew
revolvers
and
threatened
it
was
beyond
any
old
tale
of
the
palace
for
less
girls
had
had
his
father
dagger
driven
through
their
hearts
his
grandfather
at
a
mere
whisper
from
a
eunuch
had
given
his
favorite
to
the
lion
the
whisper
was
found
incorrect
at
a
later
too
late
date
and
the
eunuch
had
furnished
the
lion
another
meal
his
modern
leniency
in
this
case
would
have
outraged
his
ancestors
but
it
was
not
in
the
bey
nature
to
deal
the
finishing
stroke
to
anything
so
soft
and
lovely
as
aimée
he
had
no
intention
of
depriving
himself
of
her
if
she
were
red
with
guilt
he
would
feign
belief
in
her
to
save
his
face
until
his
infatuation
was
gratified
but
actually
he
did
not
believe
in
any
great
guilt
of
hers
tewfick
pasha
for
all
his
indulgent
modernity
would
keep
too
strict
a
harem
for
that
what
he
rather
believed
had
happened
was
that
the
young
american
now
so
happily
immured
in
his
masonry
had
become
aware
of
the
girl
through
the
story
of
her
french
father
and
in
that
connection
had
struck
up
the
clandestine
and
romantic
correspondence
which
had
led
to
their
mutual
infatuation
and
his
desperate
venture
there
that
afternoon
the
young
man
had
been
dealt
with
and
the
thought
of
the
very
summary
and
competent
way
he
had
been
dealt
with
drew
the
fangs
from
the
bite
of
that
night
invasion
his
fury
felt
soothingly
glutted
he
had
been
a
match
for
them
both
he
recalled
his
own
subtlety
and
agility
with
a
genuine
smile
as
he
exchanged
his
dripping
uniform
for
more
informal
trousers
and
a
house
coat
he
had
taught
that
young
man
a
lesson
a
final
and
ultimate
lesson
and
he
was
beginning
to
teach
one
to
that
girl
before
he
was
done
with
her
he
felt
for
her
a
mingled
passion
for
her
beauty
and
a
lust
for
conquest
of
her
resistant
spirit
that
fed
every
base
and
cruel
instinct
of
his
nature
a
find
a
rare
find
even
with
her
circumvented
lover
he
would
have
his
sport
with
her
but
though
he
promised
this
to
himself
with
feline
relish
apprehension
and
chagrin
were
still
working
the
fond
fatuity
with
which
he
had
welcomed
that
little
creature
had
been
rudely
overthrown
and
his
pride
smarted
at
the
idea
of
the
whispers
that
might
echo
and
through
his
palace
he
was
too
wise
an
old
hand
to
flatter
himself
that
it
would
preserve
its
bland
and
silent
unawareness
of
this
night
so
far
he
believed
he
had
been
unobserved
in
yussuf
silence
he
had
absolute
confidence
but
of
course
there
were
a
hundred
other
chances
some
spying
eye
some
curious
straining
ear
and
for
this
matter
of
the
boating
mishap
he
cursed
himself
now
as
he
combed
up
his
fair
mustaches
and
settled
a
scarlet
fez
upon
his
thinned
thatch
of
graying
hair
cursed
himself
roundly
for
his
malicious
resort
to
that
old
oubliette
anything
else
would
have
done
to
frighten
and
overwhelm
her
and
yet
he
had
gratified
his
dramatic
itch
and
now
had
paid
for
it
with
that
idiotic
story
of
the
boating
expedition
he
had
reason
to
trust
fatima
there
was
history
behind
the
old
sword
scar
upon
her
cheek
and
he
had
a
hold
over
her
through
her
ambition
for
a
son
but
fatima
was
a
woman
and
she
or
some
other
who
would
see
that
drenched
satin
would
be
curious
of
that
boating
story
and
of
course
they
could
find
out
from
the
boatman
it
occurred
to
him
to
go
and
see
the
boatman
and
order
him
away
so
that
afterward
the
man
could
say
he
had
been
sent
off
duty
and
the
story
of
a
nocturnal
river
trip
would
not
appear
too
incredible
it
was
a
small
concession
to
stop
gossip
mouth
so
drawing
on
a
swinging
military
cloak
the
general
stole
down
through
the
stair
of
the
water
entrance
into
the
lower
hall
where
the
pale
light
gleamed
through
the
iron
of
the
gate
and
the
gatekeeper
slept
like
a
log
in
his
muffling
cloak
the
soundness
of
that
slumber
loudly
attested
by
the
fumes
of
wine
afforded
the
general
a
profound
pleasure
he
took
the
keys
softly
and
went
to
the
gate
it
afforded
him
less
pleasure
to
observe
that
the
gate
was
unlocked
but
he
put
this
down
to
the
keeper
muddleheadedness
carefully
he
turned
the
lock
and
pocketed
the
keys
for
a
lesson
to
the
man
overdeep
sleep
in
the
morning
and
to
attest
his
own
presence
there
that
night
then
he
went
back
and
brought
out
an
oar
which
he
placed
conspicuously
beside
the
smallest
boat
drawn
up
just
within
the
gates
he
was
afraid
to
alter
the
boat
position
lest
the
noise
should
prove
too
wakening
but
he
considered
he
had
laid
an
artistic
foundation
for
his
story
and
with
a
gratifying
sense
of
triumph
he
mounted
the
stairs
he
was
not
conscious
of
fatigue
he
had
always
been
a
wiry
indefatigable
person
and
the
alarms
and
emotions
of
this
night
had
cleared
his
head
of
its
wines
and
drowsiness
he
felt
the
sense
of
tense
highstrung
power
which
came
to
him
in
war
in
fighting
in
any
element
of
danger
youth
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
it
youth
was
buried
in
his
masonry
and
helpless
in
its
shuttered
room
power
was
master
power
craft
subtlety
but
his
elation
ebbed
as
he
crossed
again
that
long
drawing
room
with
its
faded
flowers
about
the
marriage
throne
and
its
abandoned
table
with
its
cloth
askew
its
crystal
disarrayed
its
candles
gutted
and
spent
the
memory
of
that
insolent
moment
when
a
man
hand
had
gripped
him
had
whirled
him
from
aimée
when
a
man
voice
and
gun
had
threatened
him
that
memory
was
too
overpowering
for
even
his
triumph
over
the
invader
to
lay
wholly
its
smart
of
outrage
he
felt
again
the
tightening
of
his
nerves
like
quivering
wires
as
he
crossed
the
violated
reception
room
and
entered
the
boudoir
it
was
empty
but
on
the
divan
the
flickering
candle
light
revealed
the
damp
spreading
stain
where
aimée
drenched
satins
had
been
he
thrust
aside
a
hanging
and
pushed
open
the
door
into
the
room
beyond
it
was
a
small
bedroom
evidently
very
recently
furnished
in
new
and
white
shining
lacquer
of
french
design
elaborately
inlaid
with
painted
porcelains
and
draped
with
a
profusion
of
rosy
taffeta
among
this
elegance
surprisingly
unrelated
to
the
ancient
paneled
walls
stood
the
hastily
opened
trunk
and
bags
of
the
bride
their
raised
lids
and
disarranged
trays
heaped
with
the
confusion
of
unaccustomed
swiftly
searching
hands
aimée
herself
in
a
gay
little
french
boudoir
robe
of
jade
and
citron
sat
huddled
in
a
chair
like
a
mute
terrified
child
in
the
hand
of
her
dresser
who
was
shaking
out
the
long
damp
hair
and
fanning
it
with
a
peacock
fan
at
the
bey
entrance
fatima
suspended
the
fanning
but
with
easy
familiarity
exhibited
the
long
ringlets
curtly
the
bey
nodded
and
gestured
in
dismissal
the
woman
laid
down
her
fan
and
with
a
last
look
at
that
strangely
still
new
mistress
she
went
noiselessly
out
a
small
service
door
with
an
air
of
negligent
assurance
hamdi
bey
gazed
about
the
room
and
yawned
truly
a
fatiguing
evening
he
remarked
in
his
dry
sardonic
voice
but
you
look
so
untouched
what
a
thing
is
radiant
youth
he
sauntered
over
to
her
who
drew
a
little
closer
together
at
his
approach
and
lifted
one
of
the
long
dark
curls
that
the
serving
woman
had
exhibited
the
ringlets
of
loveliness
he
murmured
you
know
the
old
saying
of
the
sadi
ringlets
of
the
lovely
are
a
chain
on
the
feet
of
reason
and
a
snare
for
the
bird
of
how
long
ago
he
said
it
and
how
true
yet
such
a
charming
chain
suppose
then
i
forgive
you
little
one
since
sages
have
forgiven
beauty
before
she
was
silent
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
the
silent
terror
with
which
a
trapped
bird
sees
its
captor
in
their
bright
darkness
the
same
mute
apprehension
the
same
filming
of
helpless
despair
ryder
was
dead
she
thought
this
cruel
incensed
old
madman
had
killed
him
for
all
his
oaths
somewhere
beneath
those
ancient
stones
he
was
lying
drowned
and
dead
a
strange
pitiable
addition
to
the
dark
secrets
of
those
grim
walls
he
had
died
for
her
sake
and
all
that
she
asked
now
of
life
she
thought
in
the
utter
agony
of
her
youth
was
death
and
very
quickly
i
am
so
soft
hearted
he
sighed
still
with
that
ringlet
in
his
lifted
hand
his
hand
which
wanted
palpably
to
settle
upon
her
and
yet
was
withheld
by
some
strange
inhibition
of
those
fixed
helpless
eyes
who
knows
perhaps
i
may
forgive
you
yet
you
might
persuade
me
he
is
dead
she
said
shiveringly
dead
he
ah
the
invader
the
intruder
the
young
man
who
wanted
you
for
a
family
in
france
the
bey
laughed
gratingly
no
i
assure
you
he
is
not
dead
i
have
not
harmed
a
hair
of
his
head
he
is
alive
only
not
with
quite
the
widest
range
of
liberty
he
broke
off
to
laugh
again
ah
you
disbelieve
he
said
politely
shall
i
send
then
for
some
proof
an
ear
perhaps
or
a
little
finger
still
very
warm
and
bleeding
to
convince
you
in
five
minutes
it
will
be
here
then
terror
stirred
again
in
her
frozen
heart
if
ryder
were
alive
and
still
in
this
man
power
you
are
horrible
she
said
to
him
in
a
voice
that
was
suddenly
clear
and
unshaken
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
fear
and
hate
and
utter
loathing
her
unexpected
spirit
was
briefly
disconcerting
the
turk
looked
down
upon
her
in
arrested
irony
and
then
he
smiled
beneath
his
mustaches
and
bent
nearer
with
kindling
gaze
not
at
all
nothing
at
all
like
that
little
dove
with
talons
i
want
sweetness
and
repentance
and
submission
and
you
have
a
strange
way
to
win
them
she
said
desperately
you
have
taken
a
strange
way
with
me
my
love
little
did
i
foresee
when
i
escorted
you
up
the
stairs
this
morning
he
broke
off
there
are
men
he
reminded
her
who
would
not
consider
a
cold
bath
as
a
complete
recompense
for
your
bridal
plans
she
was
silent
but
i
he
murmured
i
am
soft
hearted
he
dropped
on
one
knee
before
her
and
tried
to
smile
into
her
averted
face
i
can
never
resist
a
charming
penitent
i
assure
you
i
am
pliability
itself
in
delicate
fingers
although
iron
and
steel
to
a
threatening
hand
if
you
should
woo
me
very
sweetly
little
one
she
could
not
overcome
and
she
could
not
hide
from
his
mocking
eyes
the
sick
shrinking
that
drew
her
back
from
his
least
touch
but
she
did
fight
down
the
wild
hysteria
of
her
repugnance
so
that
her
voice
was
not
the
trembling
gasp
it
wanted
to
be
how
can
i
know
what
you
are
she
told
him
you
mock
me
you
threaten
to
torture
that
man
it
would
be
folly
not
to
think
that
you
are
deceiving
me
if
you
would
only
prove
to
me
so
that
i
could
believe
if
you
would
but
prove
to
so
that
could
believe
prove
that
you
are
mine
and
not
that
infidel
prove
that
you
bring
me
a
wife
devotion
not
a
wanton
indifference
he
caught
her
cold
hands
trying
to
draw
her
forward
to
him
prove
that
you
only
pity
him
he
whispered
but
that
your
love
will
be
mine
she
felt
as
if
a
serpent
clasped
her
and
yet
if
that
were
the
only
way
to
win
ryder
safety
if
it
were
possible
for
her
sickened
senses
to
allay
this
madman
suspicions
and
undermine
his
revenge
quiveringly
she
thought
that
to
save
ryder
she
would
go
through
fire
but
the
hideous
mocking
uncertainties
her
utter
helplessness
her
lost
deference
it
was
not
a
sudden
sound
that
broke
in
upon
them
but
rather
the
perception
of
many
sounds
muffled
half
heard
but
gaining
upon
their
consciousness
running
feet
a
stifled
voice
something
faint
and
shrill
aimée
sprang
to
her
feet
the
general
rose
with
her
and
turned
his
head
inquiringly
in
the
direction
then
he
jerked
open
the
door
through
which
fatima
had
disappeared
it
led
to
a
dark
service
corridor
and
small
anteroom
from
whose
bed
the
attendant
was
absent
an
outer
door
was
ajar
no
need
to
question
the
sounds
now
faint
but
piercingly
shrill
shrieks
were
sounding
from
above
while
the
footsteps
were
racing
some
down
some
up
the
bey
flung
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
hurried
towards
the
confusion
chapter
xx
beyond
the
door
ryder
had
stood
stock
still
with
amazement
when
the
girl
began
to
scream
she
had
gone
mad
he
thought
for
an
instant
in
masculine
bewilderment
and
then
her
madness
revealed
its
treacherous
cunning
for
she
began
crying
wildly
for
help
against
an
invader
an
infidel
a
dog
of
a
christian
who
had
stolen
into
her
rooms
she
had
chucked
him
to
the
lions
ryder
perceived
one
furious
flash
of
lightning
jealousy
and
oriental
anger
had
overthrown
in
that
wild
and
lawless
head
every
other
design
for
him
for
which
she
had
risked
so
much
he
had
scorned
her
he
had
flouted
her
caprice
he
had
dared
to
refuse
the
languors
of
those
dangerous
eyes
the
hurrying
footsteps
appeared
to
him
the
tread
of
a
legion
in
action
and
he
had
no
desire
to
rush
out
upon
the
oncomers
he
had
indeed
distinct
doubts
of
his
ruthless
ability
to
pass
that
supple
clawing
incensed
creature
at
the
door
he
whirled
and
made
a
bolt
for
the
window
striking
at
the
fastened
grill
he
heard
the
snapping
of
wooden
bolts
and
the
splintering
of
wood
and
out
through
the
hole
he
climbed
to
a
precipitous
flight
that
fairly
felt
the
clutching
hands
upon
his
ankle
he
had
meant
to
make
a
jump
for
it
a
plunge
into
the
nile
appeared
a
gentle
exercise
compared
to
the
alternative
within
the
palace
but
in
the
very
act
of
releasing
his
hold
he
changed
his
mind
quicker
than
he
had
ever
moved
before
in
any
vicissitude
of
his
lithe
and
agile
youth
he
clambered
up
not
down
and
crouching
back
from
sight
upon
the
jutting
top
of
the
window
he
sent
his
coat
sailing
violently
through
space
he
dared
not
look
over
for
its
descent
upon
the
water
for
other
heads
were
peering
from
below
and
he
could
hear
an
excited
outburst
of
speech
that
broke
sharply
off
evidently
they
were
hurrying
down
to
the
water
gate
swiftly
he
utilized
this
misdirection
for
his
own
ends
the
roofs
that
was
the
refuge
to
make
for
flat
roofs
from
which
one
could
climb
off
onto
a
wall
or
a
palm
or
a
side
street
he
had
only
a
story
to
ascend
and
he
made
it
in
record
time
fearful
that
the
searchers
whom
he
heard
now
launching
a
boat
below
would
turn
their
eyes
skywards
but
he
gained
the
top
without
an
outcry
being
raised
and
found
himself
upon
the
roof
where
the
ladies
of
the
harem
took
their
air
unseen
of
any
save
the
blind
eyes
of
the
muezzin
in
the
sultan
mosque
upon
the
hill
there
were
divans
and
a
little
taboret
or
two
and
a
framework
where
an
awning
could
be
raised
against
the
sun
there
was
also
a
trap
door
and
here
tempestuously
he
changed
his
mind
again
he
abandoned
the
goal
of
outer
walls
and
chances
of
escape
he
wrenched
violently
at
that
trap
door
it
was
bolted
but
the
bolt
was
an
ancient
one
and
gave
at
his
furious
exertions
letting
him
down
into
a
narrow
spiral
staircase
between
walls
down
he
plunged
in
haste
before
some
confused
searcher
should
dash
up
it
was
no
place
to
meet
an
opposing
force
nor
was
the
corridor
in
which
he
found
himself
much
better
it
was
black
and
baffling
as
a
labyrinth
with
unexpected
turnings
and
he
kept
gingerly
close
to
the
wall
with
one
hand
clutching
a
bit
of
iron
which
he
had
taken
into
his
possession
and
his
pocket
when
aziza
had
led
him
out
of
the
underground
walls
the
very
bit
of
pointed
iron
it
was
with
which
the
volatile
creature
had
effected
his
rescue
he
considered
it
an
invaluable
souvenir
and
twice
in
his
nervous
apprehension
he
almost
brought
it
down
upon
shadows
direction
he
judged
vaguely
by
the
screaming
which
was
still
going
on
at
a
tremendous
rate
evidently
the
girl
had
gone
off
into
genuine
hysterics
or
else
she
had
determined
not
to
leave
her
agitation
at
the
intrusion
in
any
manner
of
question
no
doubt
the
outcries
were
a
relief
to
her
mingled
emotions
remorse
at
her
impetuosity
and
chagrin
that
her
thwarted
plans
might
conceivably
be
now
among
those
emotions
and
since
the
vicinity
of
those
shrieks
must
be
a
gathering
place
to
be
avoided
by
him
he
stole
on
down
the
upper
hall
and
finding
a
stair
he
went
down
for
two
continuous
flights
aimée
rooms
he
knew
had
been
upon
the
water
and
recalling
the
general
direction
of
those
two
lighted
windows
that
he
had
seen
so
recently
from
without
his
excavator
instinct
led
him
on
once
he
saw
the
flitting
figure
of
a
turbaned
woman
in
time
to
draw
back
into
a
niche
and
again
he
flattened
into
a
soundless
shadow
against
the
wall
as
two
young
serving
girls
ran
by
on
slippered
feet
their
anklets
tinkling
chattering
to
each
other
in
delighted
excitement
and
then
the
stealthy
opening
of
a
door
it
was
the
very
door
by
which
yussuf
had
precipitated
himself
upon
the
struggle
at
the
supper
table
some
hours
ago
gave
him
a
glimpse
into
the
far
glooms
of
the
reception
room
where
its
long
side
of
mashrubiyeh
windows
revealed
now
between
its
fretwork
tiny
chinks
of
a
paling
sky
he
could
make
out
the
marriage
throne
and
the
pallor
of
the
disordered
cloth
upon
the
abandoned
table
below
and
behind
the
table
the
dark
draperies
of
the
remaining
portières
before
the
doorway
into
the
boudoir
where
he
had
hidden
himself
and
into
which
he
had
last
seen
aimée
thrust
at
the
other
end
of
the
great
room
were
the
entrance
stairs
to
the
harem
and
there
he
imagined
a
watchman
was
stationed
or
else
stout
bolts
and
bars
were
guarding
the
situation
there
remained
an
arched
doorway
into
other
formal
rooms
through
which
he
had
seen
aimée
and
the
guests
disappear
for
the
wedding
supper
and
that
way
led
he
surmised
down
into
the
service
quarters
a
sorry
choice
of
exits
he
could
form
no
plan
in
advance
but
trust
blindly
to
the
amazing
chances
of
adventure
and
first
before
he
rushed
for
escape
there
was
aimée
to
find
yet
for
all
the
mad
hazard
of
the
situation
he
was
elated
with
life
he
felt
as
if
he
had
never
fully
lived
until
now
when
every
breath
was
informed
with
the
sharp
prescience
of
danger
he
was
at
once
cool
and
exultant
wary
yet
reckless
with
the
joyous
recklessness
of
utter
desperation
with
care
he
surveyed
the
it
appeared
deserted
but
as
he
watched
his
tense
nerves
could
see
the
shadows
forming
taking
furtive
crouching
shape
and
then
dissolving
harmlessly
into
a
rug
a
chair
or
a
stirring
drapery
his
eyes
grown
used
to
the
dimness
he
identified
the
mantle
upon
the
floor
in
which
he
had
come
and
which
he
had
extended
to
aimée
in
that
brief
moment
of
fatuous
triumph
and
beyond
it
across
a
chair
was
the
portière
which
the
black
had
torn
down
from
the
doorway
to
wrap
about
ryder
helpless
form
as
he
had
carried
him
down
to
living
death
that
mantle
he
thought
might
yet
be
useful
and
he
stole
forward
and
recovered
it
but
as
he
straightened
another
shadow
darted
out
from
the
boudoir
door
and
silhouetted
for
an
instant
against
the
lighted
room
he
saw
a
figure
in
a
long
swinging
military
cloak
discovery
was
inevitable
and
ryder
made
a
swift
plunge
to
take
the
cloaked
figure
by
surprise
but
even
as
one
hand
shot
out
and
gripped
the
throat
while
the
other
held
his
threatening
iron
aloft
his
clutch
relaxed
his
arm
fell
nervelessly
at
his
side
for
from
the
figure
had
come
the
broken
gasp
of
a
soft
voice
and
the
face
upturned
to
his
was
a
pale
oval
under
dark
disordered
hair
aimée
he
breathed
in
exultant
still
joy
aimée
did
i
hurt
you
oh
no
no
came
aimée
shaken
voice
oh
you
are
safe
he
felt
her
trembling
in
his
clasp
and
he
swept
her
close
to
him
for
one
breathless
instant
they
clung
together
in
a
sharp
passionate
gladness
which
blurred
every
sense
of
dread
or
danger
they
were
safe
they
were
together
and
for
the
moment
it
was
enough
every
obstacle
was
surmounted
every
terror
conquered
they
clung
obliviously
like
children
her
pale
face
against
his
shoulder
her
hair
brushing
his
lips
her
wild
heartbeats
throbbing
against
his
own
then
the
girl
remembering
lifted
her
head
quick
we
must
go
she
whispered
for
there
i
made
a
fire
he
followed
her
frightened
backward
glance
at
the
boudoir
door
and
suddenly
saw
its
cracks
and
key
hole
strangely
radiant
with
light
he
left
me
to
go
to
those
screams
she
was
saying
rapidly
i
tried
to
run
that
way
and
found
that
woman
coming
back
and
i
told
her
to
wait
in
her
own
room
and
i
slipped
back
in
there
and
suddenly
it
came
to
me
to
thrust
the
candle
about
i
thought
i
would
run
out
and
if
i
met
any
one
i
would
call
and
say
the
general
was
burning
and
perhaps
in
the
confusion
the
terrible
desperation
of
her
both
stirred
and
wrung
him
she
was
so
little
so
helpless
so
trembling
in
his
clasp
so
made
for
love
and
tenderness
and
to
think
of
her
in
such
fear
and
horror
that
she
went
thrusting
reckless
candles
into
her
hangings
setting
a
palace
on
fire
in
the
blind
fury
for
escape
to
such
work
had
this
night
brought
her
this
night
and
three
men
for
he
and
the
craven
tewfick
and
the
fanatic
bey
were
all
linked
in
this
night
work
yes
and
another
man
and
he
thought
swiftly
in
a
lightning
flash
of
wonder
how
little
that
paul
delcassé
had
known
when
he
set
his
eager
face
toward
the
old
world
with
his
wife
and
baby
with
him
that
he
was
setting
his
feet
into
such
a
web
that
his
wife
would
die
languishing
in
a
harem
and
his
little
daughter
would
one
night
be
flying
in
mad
terror
from
the
cruel
beast
the
weak
pasha
had
sold
her
to
and
how
little
for
that
matter
he
had
known
when
he
had
set
his
own
face
toward
those
same
sands
what
secrets
he
would
discover
there
and
what
forbidden
ways
his
heart
would
know
these
thoughts
all
went
through
him
like
one
thought
in
some
clear
remote
background
of
his
mind
while
he
was
swiftly
drawing
on
the
military
cloak
she
gave
him
and
wrapping
her
in
the
black
mantle
there
was
a
veil
on
the
mantle
hood
that
she
could
fling
across
her
face
when
she
wished
but
ryder
had
no
fez
to
complete
the
deceptive
outline
of
his
masquerade
he
must
trust
to
the
dark
and
to
the
concealment
of
the
high
military
collar
of
the
cloak
do
you
know
a
way
he
whispered
and
at
her
shaken
head
the
water
gate
he
said
thinking
swiftly
there
would
be
a
crowd
now
about
the
gate
but
if
they
could
only
manage
to
gain
those
cellars
and
hide
somewhere
they
could
steal
out
later
upon
that
waterman
it
seemed
the
most
feasible
of
all
the
desperate
plans
the
roofs
might
be
a
trap
the
harem
entrance
led
into
a
garden
and
the
garden
was
guarded
by
an
impassable
wall
but
if
he
could
only
get
to
the
river
he
knew
that
he
was
a
strong
enough
swimmer
to
save
aimée
or
he
might
even
terrorize
the
watchman
into
furnishing
a
boat
she
did
not
question
but
guided
him
swiftly
through
the
arch
that
led
down
into
the
banqueting
hall
twice
that
day
she
had
gone
down
those
stairs
once
in
her
bridal
state
her
eyes
shining
her
cheeks
glowing
with
the
wild
joy
of
ryder
arrival
and
dreams
of
escape
and
again
scarcely
an
hour
gone
by
she
had
descended
them
tense
and
desperate
her
revolver
at
the
general
head
seeking
vainly
ryder
rescue
and
now
a
third
time
a
guilty
reckless
fugitive
in
the
night
she
stole
down
those
stairs
into
the
hall
where
she
had
been
fêted
in
state
among
her
guests
here
her
only
knowledge
was
of
the
stone
corridor
and
the
locked
door
through
which
the
bey
had
led
her
but
ryder
knew
the
way
that
aziza
had
brought
him
and
he
turned
cautiously
toward
those
wide
curving
stairs
keeping
aimée
a
few
steps
behind
him
he
went
down
the
soft
carpet
and
peered
out
at
the
bottom
towards
the
water
gate
he
saw
no
bars
the
gate
was
open
and
against
the
pale
square
of
the
water
were
the
black
silhouettes
of
the
general
and
the
gateman
both
leaning
out
at
some
splashing
in
the
river
he
knew
a
boy
reckless
impulse
to
shove
them
both
in
it
was
an
unholy
thought
his
better
judgment
rejected
unless
driven
to
it
yet
some
prankish
element
in
his
roused
recklessness
would
not
have
deplored
the
necessity
if
they
looked
about
but
they
did
not
stir
as
with
aimée
cold
hand
in
his
he
made
the
tiptoed
descent
and
slipped
softly
about
the
corner
of
the
steps
then
instead
of
going
on
down
the
hall
to
some
hiding
place
in
the
ruins
he
took
a
suddenly
revealed
sharper
turn
into
a
narrow
passage
just
beyond
the
stairs
it
might
lead
to
another
gate
some
service
entrance
perhaps
it
ran
so
straight
and
direct
between
its
walls
intuitively
that
excavator
sense
of
his
defined
the
direction
they
were
going
parallel
with
the
river
although
a
little
way
back
from
the
water
wall
and
in
the
direction
of
the
men
part
of
the
palace
the
selamlik
he
recalled
the
selamlik
vaguely
as
an
irregular
mass
of
buildings
and
though
the
formal
entrance
was
of
course
through
the
garden
from
the
avenue
there
was
a
narrow
side
street
or
lane
leading
back
to
the
water
edge
between
this
part
of
the
palace
and
the
nest
building
and
very
likely
there
was
some
entrance
on
that
lane
bitterly
he
blamed
himself
for
his
lack
of
complete
inspection
that
morning
to
be
sure
he
had
told
himself
then
as
he
strolled
about
the
high
garden
walls
and
peered
down
the
narrow
lane
on
one
side
of
the
nile
backwaters
that
he
did
need
a
map
of
the
place
for
his
arrival
at
an
afternoon
reception
he
was
simply
going
in
and
out
and
clothes
and
speech
were
his
only
real
concern
he
had
even
said
to
himself
that
he
might
not
reveal
himself
to
aimée
if
she
did
not
discover
him
he
wanted
merely
to
see
her
again
and
be
sure
that
she
understood
her
own
history
he
had
no
notion
of
attempting
any
further
relations
with
her
any
resumption
of
their
forbidden
and
dangerous
acquaintance
and
it
was
true
that
had
been
the
defiant
and
protesting
surface
of
his
thoughts
but
deep
within
himself
there
had
always
been
that
hot
hidden
spark
ready
to
kindle
to
a
flame
at
her
word
and
with
it
the
unowned
secret
longing
that
she
would
speak
the
word
and
when
she
had
called
on
him
for
help
when
the
trembling
appeal
had
sprung
past
her
stricken
pride
and
he
had
seen
the
terror
in
her
soft
child
eyes
then
the
spark
had
struck
its
conflagration
he
had
become
nothing
but
a
hot
headstrong
fury
of
devotion
and
he
said
to
himself
now
that
he
might
have
known
it
was
going
to
happen
and
that
if
he
had
not
been
so
concerned
that
morning
about
saving
his
face
and
preserving
this
fiction
of
indifference
he
would
know
a
little
more
about
the
labyrinth
they
were
poking
about
in
the
little
more
that
tips
the
scale
between
safety
and
destruction
but
he
did
not
know
and
blind
chance
was
his
only
goddess
the
passage
had
brought
him
to
a
wall
and
a
narrow
stairs
while
another
passage
led
off
to
the
right
apparently
to
the
forward
regions
of
the
place
he
took
the
stairs
he
had
had
enough
of
underground
regions
when
they
did
not
lead
to
water
gates
and
the
stairs
promised
novelty
at
least
he
wished
he
knew
more
about
turkish
palaces
he
supposed
they
had
a
fairly
consistent
ground
plan
but
beyond
a
few
main
features
of
inner
courts
and
halls
he
was
culpably
ignorant
of
their
intentions
if
it
were
an
early
egyptian
tomb
or
temple
now
but
then
perhaps
the
turks
were
more
indefinite
in
their
building
and
rebuilding
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
a
door
stood
half
ajar
through
the
crack
he
strained
his
eyes
but
his
anxious
glance
met
only
the
darkness
of
utter
night
not
a
gleam
of
light
and
not
a
sound
except
the
far
hollow
stamping
of
some
stabled
horse
softly
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
he
and
aimée
slipped
within
the
place
whatever
it
was
appeared
deserted
a
dark
bare
backstairs
region
for
he
stumbled
over
a
bucket
from
which
to
the
right
he
could
just
discern
a
hall
leading
into
the
forward
part
of
the
palace
wanly
lighted
some
distance
on
with
the
pale
flicker
of
an
old
ceiling
lamp
they
seemed
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
the
darker
shadows
in
the
walls
about
them
appeared
to
be
a
number
of
doors
closed
so
his
groping
hands
informed
him
oh
for
his
excavator
steady
light
or
a
pocket
flash
oh
for
a
light
of
any
kind
even
a
temporary
match
but
he
dared
not
risk
the
scratch
for
now
he
caught
the
thud
of
footfalls
overhead
heavy
footfalls
and
there
might
be
stairs
unexpectedly
close
at
hand
he
turned
to
aimée
but
the
girl
shook
her
head
helplessly
and
hesitant
and
dashed
for
all
their
young
confidence
they
wavered
a
moment
hand
in
hand
in
the
dark
fearful
of
what
a
rash
move
might
bring
upon
them
and
in
the
beating
stillness
ryder
became
conscious
that
the
muffled
monotonous
stamping
of
a
horse
is
a
gloomy
disheartening
thing
in
the
night
and
that
footsteps
overhead
are
of
all
noises
the
most
nervous
and
unsettling
what
was
behind
those
doors
not
a
spark
of
light
came
from
them
that
was
one
comfort
the
rooms
kitchen
service
store
rooms
or
whatever
they
were
appeared
in
the
same
blackness
and
oblivion
but
any
door
might
open
on
a
roomful
of
sleeping
gardeners
and
grooms
life
and
more
than
life
hung
on
the
blind
goddess
it
was
only
an
instant
that
they
hesitated
there
yet
it
appeared
an
eternity
of
indecision
then
nearer
footsteps
sounded
coming
down
that
hall
no
more
wavering
of
the
scales
ryder
turned
to
the
door
at
his
left
at
the
very
end
of
the
wall
beyond
which
came
that
far
stamping
and
wrenched
it
open
closing
it
swiftly
behind
him
he
saw
a
light
now
a
mild
yellow
ray
through
an
opened
door
ahead
that
vaguely
illumined
the
strange
old
vehicles
of
the
palace
and
the
stables
were
beyond
some
one
else
was
beyond
too
in
the
stables
for
that
very
instant
he
saw
a
black
horse
backed
restively
into
sight
its
tossing
head
evading
the
hands
that
were
trying
to
bridle
it
the
fortieth
door
said
ryder
to
himself
with
an
involuntary
thrust
of
humor
the
door
of
the
horse
the
door
of
forbidden
daring
he
knew
now
the
vague
associations
that
had
stirred
in
him
as
he
had
stared
blindly
about
that
place
of
doors
but
he
had
opened
so
many
forbidden
doors
of
late
that
this
last
was
welcome
as
the
supreme
test
and
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
been
more
welcome
than
a
horse
a
horse
with
a
way
out
behind
it
stay
back
he
said
under
his
breath
to
aimée
and
clasping
his
bit
of
iron
he
moved
toward
the
door
he
could
see
the
attendant
now
who
was
finishing
his
bridling
and
it
was
yussuf
the
eunuch
so
busy
gentling
and
soothing
the
horse
that
he
cast
only
one
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
he
heard
and
that
one
glance
misled
him
in
its
glimpse
of
the
cloak
by
your
favor
but
an
instant
he
called
out
and
he
is
ready
stand
aside
said
ryder
very
clearly
emerging
from
the
shadows
at
the
horse
heels
out
of
the
way
with
you
the
horse
is
for
me
a
moment
yussuf
gaped
then
he
dropped
the
bridle
and
his
hand
went
swiftly
to
the
knife
hilt
in
his
belt
fool
said
ryder
contemptuously
would
you
tempt
fate
do
you
think
i
am
such
that
your
knife
could
harm
me
must
i
prove
to
you
again
that
walls
are
nothings
that
i
but
let
myself
be
taken
to
prove
my
powers
ethiopians
are
superstitious
and
yussuf
knew
that
his
brick
and
mortar
had
been
strong
yet
they
have
great
trust
in
a
crooked
knife
and
yussuf
did
not
relax
his
hold
upon
his
and
for
all
that
ryder
could
see
there
was
no
hesitation
in
the
grinning
ferocity
of
his
black
face
yet
his
spring
was
an
instant
delayed
and
in
that
instant
ryder
spoke
again
look
now
at
the
wall
behind
you
he
said
quickly
yussuf
looked
and
as
he
turned
his
bullet
head
ryder
jumped
close
and
brought
his
iron
down
upon
it
with
a
sickening
force
he
thought
scarcely
short
of
murder
to
his
amazement
the
black
did
not
fall
but
staggered
only
and
ryder
had
need
to
send
the
knife
spinning
from
his
grasp
and
strike
again
before
the
eunuch
knees
sagged
and
his
huge
bulk
sank
at
ryder
feet
this
time
ryder
took
no
chance
with
a
shammed
unconsciousness
he
snatched
down
bits
of
leather
from
the
wall
and
bound
the
hands
and
feet
in
tight
security
and
seeing
that
he
was
breathing
although
heavily
he
thrust
a
gagging
handkerchief
into
his
mouth
then
he
dragged
the
heavy
body
towards
a
pile
of
hay
he
saw
in
a
vacant
stall
and
concealed
it
effectively
but
not
too
smotheringly
although
yussuf
he
felt
would
be
no
grievous
loss
to
society
vaguely
in
the
back
of
his
consciousness
he
had
been
aware
of
the
excited
plunge
of
the
horse
and
then
of
a
low
soothing
murmur
of
speech
and
now
he
turned
to
find
aimée
holding
the
bridle
and
stroking
the
quivering
creature
with
gentle
fearless
hands
is
he
dead
she
asked
quietly
of
the
eunuch
stunned
said
ryder
meaning
reassurement
and
was
startled
by
the
passion
of
her
cry
oh
i
could
kill
them
all
all
i
will
if
they
try
to
stop
us
he
promised
grimly
forgetful
of
that
oath
to
aziza
hastily
he
glanced
about
the
stalls
there
was
no
other
horse
there
only
a
pair
of
donkeys
and
though
there
might
conceivably
be
other
horses
behind
other
doors
there
was
no
instant
to
spare
in
search
this
luck
was
too
prodigious
to
risk
the
door
to
the
street
had
already
been
unbolted
and
now
he
threw
it
back
with
a
quick
look
into
the
dark
emptiness
of
the
narrow
side
street
and
then
with
a
tight
hold
of
the
reins
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
aimée
up
into
his
arms
her
head
on
his
shoulder
her
arms
clasping
him
it
was
a
huge
bedouin
saddle
with
back
and
curved
pummel
and
the
slender
pair
no
more
than
filled
it
making
apparently
no
weight
at
all
for
the
spirited
beast
which
tore
out
of
the
stalls
at
the
charging
gallop
beloved
of
eastern
horsemen
for
a
moment
ryder
felt
wildly
that
he
might
meet
the
fate
of
the
rash
youth
in
his
patron
story
he
had
never
ridden
a
horse
like
this
which
like
all
arabs
resented
the
authority
of
any
but
his
master
and
though
a
good
horseman
ryder
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
his
seat
and
aimée
in
his
arms
around
the
corner
of
the
lane
the
horse
went
racing
and
down
the
dark
avenue
his
flying
feet
struck
back
their
sparks
of
fire
across
an
open
square
he
plunged
while
irate
camels
screamed
at
him
and
a
harsh
voice
shouted
back
loud
curses
it
seemed
to
ryder
that
other
voices
joined
in
that
there
was
a
pursuit
an
outcry
and
then
they
were
out
down
an
open
road
wildly
galloping
like
a
mad
highwayman
under
a
pale
morning
sky
chapter
xxi
miss
jeffries
makes
a
call
that
morning
miss
jeffries
ate
two
eggs
she
ate
them
successively
with
increasing
deliberation
and
afterwards
she
lingered
interminably
over
her
toast
and
marmalade
still
ryder
made
no
appearance
and
since
the
arab
waiter
had
informed
her
that
he
had
not
yet
breakfasted
she
concluded
that
he
was
not
at
the
hotel
but
had
spent
the
night
with
some
friend
of
his
probably
that
andrew
mclean
to
whom
he
was
always
running
off
nor
was
he
in
to
luncheon
that
was
rank
extravagance
because
he
was
paying
at
pension
rates
his
extravagance
however
was
no
affair
of
hers
neither
she
informed
herself
frigidly
was
his
appearance
or
his
it
was
only
rather
dull
of
jack
to
lose
so
many
well
opportunities
she
was
not
going
to
be
in
cairo
forever
not
much
longer
in
fact
there
were
adages
about
gathering
rosebuds
while
ye
may
and
making
hay
while
the
sun
shone
that
jack
ryder
would
do
well
to
observe
other
men
did
reflected
jinny
jeffries
with
a
proud
lift
of
her
ruddy
head
only
somehow
the
other
men
well
jack
provokingly
attractive
only
of
course
if
he
was
going
to
rely
upon
his
attraction
and
not
upon
his
attentions
deliberately
miss
jeffries
smiled
upon
a
stalwart
tourist
from
new
york
and
promised
her
society
for
a
foursome
at
bridge
in
the
hotel
lounge
that
evening
later
when
jack
still
failed
to
materialize
and
behold
her
inaccessibility
the
exhibition
seemed
hardly
to
have
been
worth
while
and
there
were
difficulties
getting
rid
of
the
new
yorker
the
next
day
he
had
ideas
about
excursions
it
was
during
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
that
the
first
twinge
of
genuine
worry
shot
across
the
sustained
resentment
which
she
was
pleased
to
call
her
complete
indifference
she
recalled
the
vigor
of
ryder
warnings
about
mentioning
his
adventure
and
the
grave
dangers
of
disclosure
and
she
began
to
wonder
she
wished
rather
that
he
had
gone
safely
out
of
the
house
before
she
went
away
of
course
nothing
could
happen
he
had
done
nothing
to
give
himself
away
he
was
simply
a
veiled
shadow
moving
humbly
as
befitted
a
lowly
stranger
among
the
high
and
hospitable
surroundings
but
still
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
gone
those
turbaned
women
had
looked
queerly
at
them
when
they
were
talking
so
long
in
the
window
perhaps
it
was
not
simply
at
the
intimacy
between
a
young
american
and
a
veiled
oriental
perhaps
their
voices
had
been
unguarded
or
jack
tones
had
awakened
suspicion
perhaps
he
had
given
himself
away
in
his
long
talk
with
the
bride
she
remembered
a
frenchwoman
who
had
come
to
interrupt
that
talk
who
had
looked
rather
sharply
at
jack
and
that
dreadful
eunuch
was
always
staring
she
thought
of
a
great
many
things
now
more
and
more
things
every
minute
and
still
she
told
herself
that
she
was
absurd
that
jack
would
be
the
first
to
ridicule
her
alarm
he
was
probably
enjoying
himself
staying
on
with
his
friends
forgetting
all
about
herself
still
his
room
at
the
hotel
had
not
been
slept
in
for
two
nights
now
nor
had
he
called
at
the
hotel
and
he
certainly
did
have
an
extensive
supply
of
clothes
and
linen
upon
him
beneath
the
mantle
particularly
she
remembered
that
he
had
exhibited
some
funny
black
tennis
shoes
which
he
had
thought
would
go
appropriately
with
a
woman
robes
absurd
to
think
of
him
as
spending
two
days
in
tennis
shoes
and
absurd
to
say
that
he
would
go
to
the
shops
and
buy
more
when
he
had
plenty
of
footgear
in
his
hotel
room
unless
he
wore
mclean
she
had
always
regarded
the
unknown
mclean
as
a
most
unnecessary
absorbent
of
jack
ryder
time
and
attention
and
now
that
view
was
deeply
reinforced
by
noon
she
decided
to
do
something
she
would
telephone
that
andrew
mclean
and
see
if
jack
had
been
there
the
agricultural
bank
that
was
the
place
an
obliging
hotel
clerk
clerks
were
always
obliging
to
miss
jeffries
gave
her
the
number
and
she
slipped
into
the
booth
feeling
a
ridiculous
amount
of
excitement
and
suspense
she
had
never
telephoned
in
cairo
only
been
telephoned
to
and
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
fact
that
the
telephone
company
was
french
at
the
phone
girl
quel
numero
vous
plait
jinny
hastily
choked
back
the
english
response
and
clutched
violently
at
french
numerals
cent
no
quatre
vingt
un
moment
she
demanded
desperately
and
hanging
up
the
receiver
sat
down
to
write
out
her
number
in
french
correctly
and
then
she
got
the
bank
and
still
clinging
to
her
french
she
requested
to
speak
to
monsieur
mclean
and
was
informed
that
it
was
monsieur
mclean
himself
oh
how
absurd
of
course
you
speak
english
she
exclaimed
this
french
telephone
upset
me
i
wanted
to
speak
to
ryder
if
he
is
there
or
else
leave
a
message
for
him
if
you
know
when
he
will
come
in
ryder
there
was
a
faint
intonation
of
surprise
in
the
voice
i
no
idea
really
when
he
be
in
said
mclean
but
you
may
leave
the
message
if
you
like
has
he
have
you
seen
him
for
some
time
stammered
jinny
feeling
that
mclean
must
be
taking
her
for
a
pursuing
adventuress
well
not
for
some
time
her
heart
sank
not
not
for
two
days
it
might
be
that
said
the
scotchman
cautiously
two
days
hours
almost
since
she
had
left
him
in
that
harem
and
mclean
had
not
seen
him
of
course
there
might
be
other
friends
who
had
and
mclean
might
know
of
them
i
afraid
i
have
to
see
you
she
said
desperately
rather
important
about
jack
ryder
and
if
i
could
just
talk
with
you
a
minute
this
afternoon
i
have
no
appointment
for
three
fifteen
mclean
told
her
concisely
evidently
he
expected
her
to
call
at
the
bank
he
was
used
to
being
called
on
shall
i
come
she
began
i
can
see
you
at
three
fifteen
mclean
reassured
her
and
she
repeated
three
fifteen
with
an
odd
vibration
in
her
voice
i
wonder
she
murmured
if
i
came
at
three
ten
or
three
twenty
but
she
did
she
was
humorously
careful
to
make
it
exactly
a
quarter
past
the
hour
when
she
left
her
cab
before
official
looking
residence
and
stepped
into
the
tiled
entrance
she
had
no
very
clear
notion
of
andrew
mclean
except
that
he
was
as
jack
had
said
scotch
single
and
skeptical
that
he
was
intimate
friend
and
an
official
sort
of
banker
and
the
word
banker
had
unconsciously
prepared
her
for
stout
dignity
and
middle
age
she
was
not
at
all
prepared
for
the
lean
rather
abrupt
young
man
who
came
forward
from
the
depths
of
the
gratefully
cool
reception
room
and
after
a
nervous
hand
clasp
waved
her
to
a
chair
he
was
still
holding
her
card
and
as
he
glanced
covertly
at
it
she
recalled
that
she
had
given
him
no
name
over
the
telephone
and
that
he
had
known
her
only
by
the
time
of
her
appointment
decidedly
she
must
have
made
an
odd
impression
well
he
could
see
for
himself
now
she
thought
a
trifle
defiantly
certainly
he
was
taking
stock
of
her
out
of
those
shrewd
swift
gray
eyes
of
his
he
could
see
that
she
was
well
certainly
a
nice
girl
as
a
matter
of
fact
mclean
could
see
that
she
was
considerably
more
rather
disconcertingly
more
it
was
not
often
that
such
apparitions
piquant
of
face
and
coppery
of
hair
teased
the
eyes
in
his
receiving
room
you
wanted
to
see
me
he
offered
mechanically
perhaps
you
have
heard
jack
ryder
speak
of
me
of
jinny
jeffries
began
the
girl
determined
to
put
the
affair
on
a
sound
social
footing
as
soon
as
possible
mclean
considered
and
in
honesty
shook
his
head
he
very
seldom
mentioned
young
ladies
oh
jinny
tried
not
to
appear
dashed
we
are
very
old
friends
in
america
and
of
course
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
since
i
been
in
cairo
in
fact
he
is
stopping
now
at
the
same
hotel
with
us
with
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
myself
mclean
smiled
he
said
it
was
a
tooth
he
mentioned
dryly
in
jinny
eyes
a
little
flicker
answered
him
but
her
words
were
ingenuous
oh
of
course
he
been
having
a
time
with
the
dentist
that
why
he
could
return
to
his
camp
what
i
meant
was
that
at
the
hotel
we
have
been
seeing
him
every
day
until
he
has
just
disappeared
since
day
before
yesterday
and
we
that
is
i
am
very
much
concerned
about
it
disappeared
you
mean
he
just
disappeared
that
all
he
has
been
at
the
hotel
he
has
been
anywhere
that
i
know
of
and
i
have
heard
a
word
from
him
so
i
telephoned
you
and
then
when
i
found
he
had
been
here
mclean
looked
off
into
space
eh
well
he
turn
up
he
said
comfortingly
jack
erratic
you
may
say
in
his
comings
and
goings
he
means
nothing
by
it
i
known
him
do
the
same
to
me
any
time
now
you
likely
to
hear
miss
jeffries
sat
up
a
little
straighter
and
her
cheeks
burned
with
brighter
warmth
it
is
just
that
i
want
to
see
him
mclean
she
took
quietly
distinct
pains
to
explain
it
because
i
am
anxious
not
a
need
not
a
need
in
the
world
jack
knows
his
way
about
he
may
have
been
called
back
to
the
diggings
you
know
if
they
dug
up
a
bit
porcelain
there
or
a
few
grains
of
corn
the
boy
would
forget
the
sun
was
shining
perhaps
his
caller
burnished
hair
had
shaped
that
thought
jack
knows
his
way
about
he
repeated
encouragingly
as
one
who
demolishes
the
absurd
fears
of
women
and
children
you
do
quite
understand
jinny
tones
were
silken
smooth
you
see
i
left
him
in
rather
unusual
circumstances
it
was
a
place
where
he
had
no
business
in
the
world
to
be
at
mclean
unguardedly
startled
gaze
her
humor
overtook
her
wrath
oh
it
was
quite
all
right
for
she
replied
mischievously
to
that
look
only
not
for
him
you
see
he
was
masquerading
again
thought
mclean
involuntarily
lord
what
a
hand
for
the
lassies
that
lad
was
and
he
had
thought
him
such
an
aloof
one
masquerading
as
a
woman
so
he
could
take
me
to
a
reception
jinny
began
to
falter
just
putting
that
escapade
into
words
portrayed
its
less
commendable
features
it
was
a
woman
reception
she
began
again
at
a
turkish
house
a
marriage
reception
she
had
certainly
secured
mclean
attention
a
marriage
reception
a
turkish
marriage
reception
he
said
very
sharply
and
amazedly
as
his
caller
continued
to
pause
do
you
mean
to
say
that
jack
ryder
went
into
a
turkish
house
dressed
as
a
woman
there
was
a
pronounced
angularity
of
feature
about
the
young
scotchman
which
now
took
on
a
chiseled
sternness
swiftly
jinny
interposed
oh
you
must
blame
him
mclean
you
see
i
wanted
very
much
to
go
to
a
turkish
reception
and
i
did
have
the
courage
to
go
alone
or
drag
some
other
tourist
as
inexperienced
as
myself
and
so
jack
why
there
did
seem
any
harm
in
his
dressing
up
just
for
fun
you
know
he
put
on
a
turkish
mantle
and
a
veil
up
to
his
eyes
and
he
was
sure
he
never
be
found
out
i
ought
not
to
have
let
him
i
know
it
was
my
fault
she
looked
so
flushed
and
innocent
and
distressed
that
chivalry
rose
swiftly
to
her
need
indeed
you
must
blame
yourself
miss
miss
jeffries
you
know
egypt
and
jack
does
he
knew
that
if
he
had
been
discovered
there
would
have
been
no
help
for
him
and
no
questions
asked
afterwards
and
it
might
have
been
very
dangerous
for
you
the
blame
is
just
his
now
he
said
decisively
yet
not
without
a
certain
sympathy
with
the
culprit
for
if
the
girl
had
looked
like
this
he
could
see
that
she
would
be
a
difficult
little
piece
to
withstand
though
any
man
with
an
ounce
of
sense
in
his
head
would
have
behaved
as
a
responsible
protector
and
not
as
a
reckless
school
boy
what
happened
he
said
quickly
oh
nothing
happened
nothing
that
i
know
of
we
got
along
very
well
i
thought
although
now
i
remember
that
some
people
stare
but
i
was
worried
at
the
time
i
thought
it
was
just
because
i
was
an
american
and
he
was
apparently
a
turkish
woman
but
there
was
no
reason
why
an
american
might
not
get
a
turkish
woman
to
act
as
a
guide
was
there
and
then
jack
told
me
to
go
home
first
he
said
it
would
be
simpler
that
way
and
that
he
would
slip
over
to
some
friend
or
to
some
safe
place
and
take
his
disguise
off
he
wore
a
gray
suit
beneath
it
and
the
only
funny
thing
was
some
black
tennis
shoes
so
i
left
him
and
he
has
been
back
since
she
added
as
mclean
was
silent
he
told
me
that
he
had
some
engagement
for
that
evening
so
i
did
not
begin
to
worry
until
the
next
day
now
just
how
long
ago
was
this
two
days
ago
day
before
yesterday
afternoon
she
looked
anxiously
at
mclean
face
and
took
alarm
at
his
careful
absence
of
expression
oh
mclean
do
you
think
he
brushed
that
aside
and
where
was
it
this
reception
at
an
old
palace
forever
away
on
the
edge
of
the
city
i
remember
the
street
we
drove
and
i
had
the
cab
wait
but
it
belonged
to
a
turkish
general
hamdi
bey
she
brought
out
triumphantly
general
hamdi
bey
mclean
did
not
correct
her
idea
of
the
title
his
expression
was
more
carefully
than
ever
while
behind
its
quiet
guard
his
thoughts
were
breaking
out
like
a
revolution
hamdi
bey
a
wedding
reception
the
daughter
of
tewfick
pasha
in
the
secret
depths
of
his
soul
he
uttered
profane
and
troubled
words
that
french
girl
again
so
ryder
had
not
forgotten
that
affair
although
he
had
kept
silent
about
it
of
late
he
had
bided
his
time
and
taken
that
rash
means
of
seeing
the
girl
again
and
he
had
involved
this
unknowing
young
american
in
a
risk
of
scandal
and
deceived
her
into
believing
herself
responsible
for
this
caprice
while
all
the
time
she
had
been
a
mere
cloak
and
it
had
been
his
own
diabolical
desire
miss
jeffries
was
surprised
to
see
a
sudden
sorry
softness
dawn
in
the
young
man
look
upon
her
and
she
was
surprised
too
at
his
next
question
i
wonder
now
if
you
were
the
young
lady
who
took
him
to
a
masquerade
ball
some
time
ago
lightly
she
acknowledged
it
you
think
i
always
taking
him
to
things
she
said
brightly
but
mclean
troubled
gaze
did
not
quicken
with
a
smile
he
was
experiencing
a
vast
compassion
she
was
so
innocent
so
unconscious
of
the
quicksands
about
her
probably
she
had
never
heard
a
breath
of
that
first
adventure
and
it
was
this
fair
christian
creature
whom
jack
ryder
had
abandoned
for
a
veiled
girl
from
a
turk
harem
mclean
filled
with
cold
antagonistic
wonder
he
forgot
the
lovely
image
of
the
french
miniature
and
remembering
tewfick
rounded
eyes
and
olive
features
he
thought
of
the
veiled
girl
most
illogically
for
he
knew
that
tewfick
was
not
her
father
as
some
image
of
base
allure
sorrowfully
he
shook
his
head
over
his
friend
he
determined
to
protect
him
and
to
protect
this
girl
innocence
of
his
behavior
he
would
help
her
to
save
him
she
could
do
it
yet
if
only
she
did
not
learn
the
truth
and
turn
from
him
if
ever
she
had
been
able
to
make
jack
go
to
a
masquerade
that
cursed
masquerade
she
could
work
other
more
beneficent
miracles
so
now
he
asked
very
cautiously
his
mind
on
divided
paths
do
you
say
there
was
nothing
to
draw
suspicion
he
did
not
talk
to
any
one
the
guests
or
the
bride
oh
yes
he
did
talk
to
the
bride
said
miss
jeffries
with
such
utter
unconsciousness
that
mclean
heart
hardened
against
the
renegade
he
talked
quite
a
while
to
her
she
said
did
you
notice
anything
oh
i
could
hear
what
was
said
he
was
the
last
in
line
and
he
stayed
for
some
time
he
said
afterward
that
it
was
all
right
she
was
very
nice
to
him
said
jinny
earnestly
producing
every
scrap
of
incident
for
mclean
judgment
she
showed
him
some
of
her
presents
something
about
her
neck
in
mclean
changed
a
startled
god
to
good
she
was
suspicious
then
he
said
weakly
not
as
far
as
i
could
see
oh
nothing
to
be
wrong
but
i
did
feel
uneasy
until
i
got
away
and
then
jack
has
come
back
again
she
looked
at
the
young
scotchman
for
confirmation
of
her
fear
and
again
she
saw
that
careful
expressionless
calm
it
no
need
for
alarm
he
told
her
slowly
since
nothing
went
wrong
i
see
no
reason
why
jack
could
have
walked
out
of
that
reception
if
we
only
knew
where
he
was
going
later
yes
something
might
have
happened
later
jinny
took
up
i
thought
of
that
he
might
have
wanted
some
more
fun
and
felt
more
reckless
oh
i
worried
she
confessed
her
gray
eyes
very
round
and
childlike
and
if
anything
had
happened
she
would
always
blame
herself
thought
mclean
ironically
the
unthinking
deviltry
of
the
young
scoundrel
when
he
found
him
he
have
a
few
things
to
say
that
why
i
came
to
you
jinny
went
on
i
hesitated
for
he
had
warned
me
so
against
telling
any
one
but
no
one
else
knows
and
no
one
must
know
mclean
assured
her
crisply
i
daresay
a
mare
nest
and
jack
will
be
found
safe
and
sound
at
his
diggings
or
off
on
a
lark
with
some
friend
or
other
but
it
well
to
make
sure
and
you
did
quite
right
in
coming
to
me
jinny
thought
she
had
done
quite
right
too
there
was
a
satisfying
strength
about
mclean
she
resented
a
trifle
his
masculine
way
of
trying
to
keep
the
dark
side
from
her
she
was
not
greatly
misled
by
that
untroubled
look
of
his
and
yet
she
was
unconsciously
reassured
by
it
and
although
he
refused
to
be
stampeded
by
alarm
he
was
not
incredulous
of
it
for
his
manner
was
frankly
grave
i
send
out
at
once
he
said
decisively
and
see
if
i
can
pick
up
any
gossip
of
that
reception
i
a
very
clever
clerk
with
brothers
in
the
bazaars
who
is
a
perfect
wireless
for
information
he
has
told
me
the
night
before
a
man
was
to
be
murdered
he
paused
reflecting
that
was
not
a
happy
suggestion
then
i
send
out
to
jack
diggings
that
express
does
stop
but
i
find
a
way
and
i
let
you
know
as
soon
as
i
can
you
very
kind
said
jinny
gratefully
his
competent
manner
brought
her
a
sensation
of
difficulties
already
solved
jack
was
as
good
as
found
she
felt
in
swift
reaction
if
he
was
in
any
trouble
this
forceful
young
man
would
settle
it
but
probably
he
was
in
any
trouble
probably
he
was
just
at
his
diggings
rushing
off
from
her
in
the
exasperating
way
he
seemed
to
do
whenever
they
were
getting
on
particularly
well
she
remembered
how
he
had
bolted
from
that
masquerade
which
had
begun
so
happily
he
had
said
he
was
ill
but
she
had
never
completely
slain
the
suspicion
that
his
illness
sprang
from
ennui
and
disinclination
she
rose
i
must
take
any
more
of
your
time
mclean
and
you
probably
have
a
four
fifteen
engagement
but
her
light
raillery
failed
of
its
mark
eh
no
i
have
not
seriously
he
assured
her
you
are
quite
the
last
one
i
took
on
the
last
before
tea
he
paused
confused
with
a
strange
suggestion
tea
his
servant
did
it
rather
well
and
it
was
time
usually
he
had
it
in
the
garden
it
was
a
charming
garden
full
of
roses
with
a
nice
view
of
the
citadel
and
his
strange
suggestion
expanded
with
a
rosy
vision
of
jinny
among
the
roses
beside
his
wicker
table
would
she
possibly
care
to
he
struggled
with
his
idea
and
with
his
shyness
and
then
the
sense
that
it
was
quite
decent
somehow
to
be
offering
tea
to
this
girl
whom
anxiety
for
ryder
unknown
lot
had
brought
to
him
overcame
that
unwonted
impulse
he
dismissed
the
idea
and
like
all
shy
men
he
was
oddly
relieved
at
the
passing
of
the
necessity
for
initiative
even
while
he
felt
his
mild
hope
expiring
pang
he
stepped
before
her
to
open
the
doors
to
which
she
was
now
taking
herself
in
the
entrance
he
saw
his
clerk
the
clever
one
going
out
and
excusing
himself
he
went
forward
to
detain
the
man
for
a
moment
there
ensued
a
colloquy
then
the
clerk
a
fellow
in
european
clothes
with
a
red
fez
began
to
relate
something
when
mclean
turned
back
to
jinny
jeffries
she
saw
that
his
look
was
sharply
altered
there
was
a
transfixed
air
about
him
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
told
her
that
he
had
had
a
shock
my
man
tells
me
he
said
that
hamdi
bey
bride
is
dead
he
buried
her
yesterday
chapter
xxii
from
the
bazaars
there
was
a
moment
pause
what
that
lovely
girl
said
jinny
in
startled
pity
she
added
incredulously
yesterday
and
only
the
day
before
why
what
have
happened
that
was
what
mclean
was
asking
himself
very
grimly
aloud
he
told
her
slowly
they
say
that
fire
happened
some
accident
a
candle
overturned
in
her
apartments
and
of
course
the
windows
were
screened
how
terrible
that
lovely
girl
said
jinny
again
she
was
genuinely
horrified
and
pitiful
yet
she
found
a
moment
to
wonder
at
the
evident
depths
of
mclean
consternation
for
of
course
he
had
never
seen
the
girl
yet
he
looked
utterly
upset
it
one
of
the
most
dreadful
things
i
ever
heard
of
jinny
murmured
on
her
wedding
night
and
she
was
so
young
mclean
and
so
exquisite
she
did
look
like
a
real
girl
she
was
a
fairy
creature
i
never
dreamed
there
were
skins
before
but
hers
was
just
like
flower
petals
jack
and
i
talked
about
it
i
remember
and
her
face
had
something
so
bewitching
about
it
something
so
sweet
and
delicate
she
broke
off
revisited
with
that
vision
of
aimée
beauty
how
little
that
poor
girl
had
thought
as
she
stood
there
in
the
bright
splendor
of
her
robes
and
diadem
that
in
a
few
hours
more
oh
i
hope
that
fire
that
it
was
merciful
that
she
suffer
she
said
almost
inaudibly
but
speech
itself
was
too
definitive
of
horrors
it
tragic
she
finished
simply
it
was
tragic
with
a
complicated
tragedy
thought
andrew
mclean
as
he
stood
there
his
eyes
narrowing
his
lips
compressed
his
mind
invaded
with
a
dark
swarm
of
conjecture
surmise
suspicion
his
vision
possessed
by
a
flitting
rush
of
pictures
he
saw
jack
talking
with
the
girl
at
the
reception
the
girl
showing
him
something
about
her
neck
that
accursed
locket
he
thought
acutely
jack
sending
miss
jeffries
home
had
he
arranged
that
purposely
was
there
some
mad
improvised
scheme
of
escape
in
the
air
the
pictures
became
mere
flitting
wraiths
of
conjecture
yet
touched
with
horrifying
possibility
jack
lingering
hiding
jack
making
love
to
the
girl
attempting
flight
jack
discovered
and
the
quick
saber
thrust
for
both
a
fire
very
likely
to
screen
the
darker
tragedy
hamdi
was
capable
of
it
to
save
his
pride
and
it
would
dispose
so
easily
of
the
evidence
mclean
thoughts
flinched
from
the
grim
outcome
of
his
fear
he
tried
to
tell
himself
that
he
was
inventing
horrors
that
the
fire
might
be
the
simple
truth
that
ryder
talk
with
the
girl
might
actually
have
ended
in
farewell
at
least
a
temporary
farewell
and
that
his
consequent
low
spirits
had
taken
him
off
to
mope
in
camp
that
was
undoubtedly
the
thing
to
believe
at
least
until
there
was
actual
necessity
to
disbelieve
it
and
looking
at
the
story
in
that
way
mclean
scotch
sense
of
providence
was
capable
of
pointing
out
the
stern
benefits
of
the
sad
visitation
whatever
mischief
might
have
been
afoot
between
his
friend
and
that
unfortunate
young
girl
the
fire
had
prevented
and
however
hard
jack
might
take
this
now
decidedly
the
poor
girl
death
was
better
for
him
than
her
life
no
more
wasting
himself
now
on
sad
romance
and
adventure
no
more
desire
and
danger
no
more
lurking
about
barred
gates
and
secret
doors
and
forbidden
palaces
no
more
clandestine
trysts
no
more
fury
of
mind
beating
against
the
bars
of
fate
jack
was
saved
even
if
he
had
succeeded
in
rescuing
the
girl
what
then
mclean
was
skeptical
of
felicity
from
such
contrasting
lives
better
the
finality
the
sharp
pain
the
utter
separation
and
then
his
eyes
returned
to
the
young
american
before
him
she
was
the
unconscious
answer
to
that
future
she
would
save
ryder
from
regret
and
retrospection
in
after
years
looking
back
from
a
happy
and
domesticity
this
would
all
become
to
him
a
fantastic
adventure
sad
with
the
remembered
but
unfelt
sadness
of
youth
yet
mercifully
dim
and
softened
with
young
beauty
jack
must
never
tell
this
girl
the
story
mclean
had
read
somewhere
of
the
mistakes
of
revelation
to
women
and
now
he
was
very
sure
of
it
she
must
never
receive
this
hurt
never
know
that
when
she
had
been
troubling
over
jack
disappearance
he
had
been
agonizing
over
another
girl
that
the
escapade
she
thought
so
intimate
a
lark
had
been
a
trick
to
see
the
other
that
the
young
creature
whose
loveliness
she
so
innocently
praised
had
been
her
rival
drawing
jack
from
her
mclean
would
speak
clearly
to
ryder
about
this
and
seal
his
lips
but
first
he
would
have
to
be
found
he
became
conscious
that
he
had
been
a
long
time
silent
following
these
thoughts
while
jinny
waited
i
do
everything
i
can
to
find
out
about
that
fire
he
told
her
i
mean
about
any
discovery
of
jack
in
the
palace
he
quickly
amended
as
her
face
was
touched
with
instant
question
and
i
see
if
any
one
in
cairo
knows
where
he
is
then
if
nothing
turns
up
just
pop
out
to
his
diggings
in
the
morning
and
make
sure
he
all
right
i
get
back
that
night
and
telephone
you
and
until
then
not
a
word
about
it
much
better
not
not
a
word
jinny
promised
and
if
you
should
happen
to
find
out
anything
i
let
you
know
at
once
well
rather
but
do
count
on
that
the
old
boy
is
out
in
his
tombs
dusting
off
his
mummies
you
may
get
a
letter
yourself
in
the
morning
he
threw
out
with
heartening
inspiration
and
while
you
are
reading
it
i
be
tearing
along
to
the
infernal
desert
he
had
brought
the
smile
to
her
eyes
as
well
as
lips
bright
and
reassured
and
comfortably
dependent
upon
his
resourceful
strength
she
took
her
leave
but
there
was
no
smile
remaining
upon
andrew
mclean
visage
hours
two
nights
and
a
day
and
the
girl
was
dead
and
in
her
grave
moslems
wasted
no
time
before
interment
and
jack
was
where
chapter
xxiii
in
the
desert
clinging
to
that
plunging
horse
ryder
made
little
attempt
at
first
to
guide
the
flight
it
was
enough
to
keep
himself
in
the
saddle
and
aimée
in
his
arms
while
every
galloping
moment
flung
a
farther
distance
between
them
and
that
palace
of
horror
his
heart
was
beating
in
a
wild
triumphant
exultation
glorious
to
be
out
under
the
free
sky
the
wind
in
his
face
the
open
world
ahead
he
felt
one
with
that
dashing
creature
beneath
him
and
aimée
was
in
his
arms
untouched
unhurt
out
from
the
power
of
that
sinister
man
and
the
expectation
of
dread
things
the
moment
was
a
supreme
and
glorious
emotion
they
were
headed
south
and
to
ryder
exhilaration
this
seemed
good
cairo
offered
no
hiding
place
for
that
fugitive
girl
even
the
harbor
that
mclean
could
give
would
not
be
proof
against
the
legal
forces
of
the
turks
law
and
order
power
and
police
were
all
in
the
hands
of
the
husband
or
father
even
now
the
alarm
might
be
given
the
telephones
ringing
aimée
must
be
hidden
until
she
could
be
smuggled
to
france
or
until
the
french
authorities
could
get
out
their
protective
documents
the
hiding
place
that
occurred
to
ryder
was
a
wild
and
desperate
expedient
the
american
hospital
at
siut
the
isolation
ward
the
pretense
of
contagious
illness
and
then
later
travel
north
in
the
care
of
nurses
all
this
if
he
could
win
over
one
of
the
doctors
at
that
moment
winning
over
a
doctor
appeared
a
sane
and
simple
thing
to
mind
the
only
difficulty
he
recognized
was
getting
aimée
into
that
hospital
but
they
would
not
be
looking
for
him
in
the
south
he
could
manage
it
he
felt
jubilantly
he
could
smuggle
her
into
his
diggings
at
night
and
then
make
his
arrangements
anything
everything
was
possible
now
that
the
nightmare
of
a
palace
was
left
behind
them
south
they
went
then
at
a
quieter
pace
the
arab
rhythmic
footfalls
ringing
through
the
still
gray
world
of
before
dawn
across
the
nile
they
made
their
way
working
out
on
sandbars
to
the
narrow
depths
where
ryder
swam
beside
the
swimming
horse
while
aimée
clung
to
the
saddle
then
south
again
along
the
river
road
the
sky
was
light
now
and
the
river
was
light
only
the
palms
and
the
villages
and
the
flat
dhurra
fields
were
dark
and
in
the
east
behind
the
mokattam
hills
a
thin
band
of
gold
began
to
brighten
life
was
stirring
small
black
boys
on
huge
black
buffaloes
splashed
in
the
river
veiled
girls
with
water
jars
on
their
heads
from
which
the
shawls
trailed
down
to
the
dust
filed
past
from
the
villages
like
a
parthenon
frieze
on
the
high
banks
the
naked
fellaheen
were
already
stooping
to
the
incessant
dipping
of
the
shadouf
while
from
the
fields
came
the
plaintive
creaking
of
the
well
sweep
as
some
harnessed
camel
or
bullock
began
its
eternal
round
a
flock
of
sheep
came
down
the
river
road
driven
by
their
ragged
shepherds
and
a
string
of
camels
burdened
beyond
all
semblance
to
themselves
bobbed
by
like
rhythmic
haystacks
led
by
a
child
carrying
a
live
turkey
in
her
arms
while
before
her
rode
her
father
in
shining
pongee
robes
on
a
white
donkey
strung
with
beads
of
blue
and
by
these
travelers
there
passed
in
that
brightening
dawn
two
other
travelers
from
the
north
a
pair
on
a
powerful
but
tired
black
horse
a
man
in
a
military
cloak
and
a
green
and
gold
turban
about
his
bronzed
head
and
behind
him
on
a
pillion
a
girl
with
bare
dangling
feet
it
was
aimée
who
had
evolved
the
disguise
constructing
the
turban
from
the
negligee
beneath
her
mantle
and
it
was
aimée
who
bargained
with
the
villagers
for
their
breakfast
eggs
and
goats
milk
and
bread
and
rice
while
her
lord
as
befitted
his
dignity
stayed
aloof
upon
his
steed
returning
a
courteous
response
of
god
bless
you
to
their
greetings
then
as
the
day
brightened
and
the
last
soft
veil
of
mist
was
burned
away
before
a
sun
that
pair
of
travelers
left
the
highroad
and
turned
west
upon
a
byway
that
led
past
fields
of
corn
and
yellow
water
and
mud
villages
where
goats
and
naked
babies
and
ragged
women
squatted
idly
in
the
dust
and
on
through
low
hills
swirled
about
with
yellow
sand
drift
and
out
into
the
desert
beyond
here
fresh
vigor
came
to
the
arab
horse
and
tossing
his
mane
and
stretching
out
his
nostrils
to
the
dry
air
he
broke
into
a
gallop
that
sent
sand
and
pebbles
flying
from
his
hoofs
to
right
and
left
the
startled
desert
hares
scattered
and
from
the
clumps
of
spiky
helga
the
black
vultures
rose
in
flight
then
the
breeze
dropped
and
the
heat
rushed
at
them
like
a
furnace
breath
and
slower
and
slower
they
made
their
way
ryder
leading
the
jaded
horse
and
aimée
nodding
in
the
saddle
mere
crawling
specks
across
the
immensity
of
sand
then
in
the
shade
of
a
huge
clump
of
beside
a
jutting
boulder
they
stopped
at
last
to
rest
the
horse
sank
on
his
knees
ryder
spread
out
his
cloak
and
aimée
dropped
down
upon
its
folds
lost
in
exhausted
sleep
as
soon
as
her
head
touched
the
sands
ryder
his
back
against
the
rock
kept
watch
it
was
not
the
exultant
ryder
of
that
first
hour
of
flight
the
excitement
of
the
night
had
subsided
and
withdrawn
its
wild
stimulation
it
was
a
hot
and
tired
and
immensely
sobered
young
man
who
sat
there
with
eyes
that
burned
from
lack
of
sleep
and
a
brow
knit
into
a
taut
and
anxious
line
realization
flooded
him
with
the
sun
responsibility
burned
in
upon
him
with
the
heat
alone
in
the
libyan
desert
he
sat
there
and
at
his
feet
there
slept
the
young
girl
whose
life
he
had
snapped
utterly
off
from
its
roots
he
was
overwhelmingly
responsible
for
her
if
she
had
never
met
him
if
he
had
never
continued
to
thrust
himself
upon
her
she
would
have
gone
on
her
predestined
way
safe
secluded
luxurious
vaguely
unhappy
and
mutinous
at
times
perhaps
in
the
secret
stirrings
of
her
blood
but
still
an
indulged
and
wealthy
little
moslem
and
now
she
lay
there
like
a
sleeping
child
the
dark
tendrils
of
hair
clinging
to
her
moist
cheeks
her
long
lashes
mingling
their
shadows
with
the
purple
underlining
of
the
terrors
homeless
exhausted
resourceless
but
for
that
young
man
desperately
he
hoped
that
she
would
not
wake
to
regret
even
a
sardonic
tyrant
in
a
palace
might
be
preferable
in
the
merciless
daylight
to
a
helpless
young
man
in
the
libyan
desert
and
she
was
so
slight
so
delicate
so
made
for
rich
and
lovely
luxury
looking
down
at
her
he
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
a
lump
of
queer
choking
tenderness
he
wanted
to
protect
her
to
save
her
to
spend
himself
for
her
he
felt
for
her
a
reverent
wonder
a
stirring
that
was
at
once
protective
and
possessive
and
denying
of
all
self
he
would
die
to
save
her
he
tried
to
tell
himself
reassuringly
that
he
saved
her
if
only
he
could
keep
her
safe
he
thought
of
the
life
before
her
he
thought
of
that
family
in
france
in
whose
name
he
had
urged
his
interference
that
unknown
delcassé
aunt
who
had
sent
out
her
agents
for
her
lost
heirs
would
she
welcome
and
endow
this
lovely
girl
he
could
not
doubt
it
aimée
youth
and
beauty
would
be
treasure
trove
to
a
jaded
lonely
woman
with
money
to
invest
in
futures
aimée
would
be
a
belle
an
heiress
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
sudden
darkness
in
his
young
eyes
and
still
she
slept
wrapped
in
the
sorry
mantle
of
his
masquerade
the
torn
chiffons
of
her
negligée
fluttering
over
her
slim
bare
feet
chapter
xxiv
the
tomb
of
a
king
there
were
several
approaches
to
the
american
excavations
mclean
on
that
morning
after
his
visit
from
jinny
jeffries
chose
to
borrow
a
friend
motor
and
man
and
break
the
speed
laws
of
upper
egypt
and
then
shift
to
an
agile
donkey
at
the
little
village
from
which
the
gulleys
ran
west
through
the
red
hills
into
the
desert
it
was
a
still
hot
day
without
cloud
or
wind
and
the
sun
had
an
air
of
standing
permanently
high
in
the
heavens
holding
the
day
at
noon
shimmering
heat
waves
quivered
about
the
base
of
the
farther
hills
and
veiled
the
desert
reaches
it
was
not
conducive
to
comfort
and
andrew
mclean
was
not
comfortable
he
was
hot
and
sticky
and
sandy
and
abominably
harassed
not
a
creature
as
far
as
he
could
discover
had
seen
jack
ryder
in
cairo
since
the
afternoon
of
that
reception
at
hamdi
bey
he
had
not
been
seen
at
the
museum
nor
the
banks
nor
at
cook
nor
the
usual
restaurants
nor
at
the
clubs
with
his
friends
and
the
clever
clerk
with
the
two
brothers
in
the
bazaar
had
unearthed
quite
a
bit
of
disquieting
news
about
that
reception
disquieting
that
is
to
one
with
secret
fears
there
had
been
a
fire
in
the
apartments
of
the
bride
of
hamdi
bey
and
the
bride
had
been
killed
instantly
that
much
was
known
to
all
the
world
the
general
had
been
distracted
he
had
sat
brooding
beside
his
bride
coffin
allowing
no
one
not
even
her
father
to
look
upon
the
poor
charred
remains
that
he
had
placed
within
he
had
been
a
man
out
of
his
mind
with
grief
gnawing
his
nails
beating
his
slaves
oh
assuredly
it
had
been
a
calamity
of
a
very
high
order
one
of
the
brothers
in
the
bazaar
had
himself
talked
with
an
old
crone
whose
sister
child
was
employed
in
the
general
kitchen
and
the
story
had
lost
nothing
on
the
route
the
bride
youth
and
beauty
her
jewels
her
robes
the
infatuation
and
the
general
grief
the
reports
of
these
ran
through
the
city
like
wildfire
and
from
the
particular
channel
of
the
kitchen
maid
and
the
old
aunt
and
the
brother
in
the
bazaars
came
news
of
the
very
especial
means
that
allah
had
taken
to
preserve
the
general
from
destruction
for
he
had
been
in
the
bride
apartments
just
before
the
fire
but
the
power
of
allah
the
allseeing
had
sent
a
thief
a
prowler
by
night
upon
the
palace
roofs
and
the
screams
of
a
girl
in
the
upper
story
had
called
the
general
to
that
direction
and
so
his
preservation
had
been
accomplished
it
was
that
rumor
of
the
thief
upon
the
roofs
which
sent
the
chill
of
apprehension
down
mclean
spine
for
though
the
bazaars
knew
nothing
of
the
thief
identity
and
it
was
reported
he
had
escaped
by
the
river
yet
mclean
felt
the
sinister
finger
of
suspicion
if
the
thief
had
not
been
a
thief
unless
of
brides
and
if
he
had
escaped
impatiently
the
young
scotchman
clapped
his
heels
against
the
donkey
sides
enhancing
the
efforts
of
the
runner
with
the
gesticulating
stick
suppose
now
that
he
should
not
find
jack
at
the
excavations
it
was
encouraging
somehow
to
hear
the
monotonous
rise
and
fall
of
the
labor
song
proceeding
as
usual
although
mclean
immediately
told
himself
that
the
work
would
naturally
be
going
on
under
direction
whether
ryder
were
there
or
not
the
camp
knew
nothing
of
cairo
the
camp
would
be
as
usual
and
yet
after
his
first
moment
survey
he
had
an
indefinite
but
uneasy
idea
that
the
camp
was
not
as
usual
true
the
tatterdemalion
frieze
of
basket
bearers
still
wove
its
rhythmic
way
over
the
mounds
to
the
siftings
where
thatcher
was
presiding
as
was
his
wont
but
in
the
native
part
of
the
encampment
there
appeared
a
sly
stir
and
excitement
the
unoccupied
of
all
ages
and
sexes
that
usually
were
squatting
interminably
about
some
fire
or
sleeping
like
mummies
in
hermetically
wrapped
black
mantles
now
were
gathered
in
little
whispering
knots
whose
backward
glances
betrayed
a
sense
of
uneasiness
and
as
mclean
rode
past
a
young
arab
who
had
been
the
center
of
attention
drew
back
with
such
carefulness
to
escape
observation
that
mclean
shrewd
eyes
marked
him
closely
it
might
be
that
his
nerves
were
deceiving
him
but
there
did
seem
to
be
something
surreptitious
in
the
air
over
his
shoulder
he
glimpsed
the
young
arab
hurrying
out
of
the
camp
it
might
be
anything
or
nothing
he
told
himself
the
man
might
be
going
shopping
to
the
village
and
the
others
giving
him
their
commissions
or
he
might
be
an
illicit
dealer
in
curios
trying
to
pick
up
some
dishonest
treasure
in
native
diggings
those
hangers
on
were
thick
as
flies
he
dismounted
and
hurried
forward
to
meet
thatcher
advance
the
men
had
rarely
met
and
thatcher
air
of
hesitation
and
made
mclean
proffer
his
name
promptly
with
a
sense
of
speeding
through
the
preliminaries
then
with
a
manner
he
strove
to
make
casual
he
put
his
question
i
say
is
ryder
back
he
knew
in
the
moment
pause
how
tight
suspense
was
gripping
him
then
thatcher
glanced
toward
the
black
yawning
mouth
of
a
tomb
entrance
why
yes
he
down
there
he
added
been
a
bit
sick
complains
of
the
sun
for
a
moment
his
relief
was
so
great
that
mclean
did
not
believe
in
it
jack
here
jack
absolutely
safe
mechanically
he
put
when
did
he
come
in
when
thatcher
hesitated
trying
to
recall
oh
night
before
last
rode
in
after
dark
he
added
reassuringly
as
the
other
swung
about
towards
the
tomb
he
says
there
nothing
really
wrong
with
him
there
no
temperature
mclean
nodded
his
relief
now
was
acutely
compounded
with
disgust
he
felt
no
lightning
leap
of
thanksgiving
that
his
friend
was
safe
but
rather
that
flash
of
irritated
reaction
which
makes
the
primitive
parent
smack
a
recovered
child
not
a
thing
in
the
world
the
matter
a
mare
nest
just
as
he
had
prophesied
to
miss
jeffries
why
in
heaven
name
had
jack
the
decency
to
send
that
young
lady
a
card
when
he
abandoned
town
so
suddenly
not
that
mclean
blamed
miss
jeffries
given
the
masquerade
and
jack
disappearance
and
a
zealous
feminine
interest
her
concern
was
perfectly
natural
but
mclean
had
left
a
busy
office
and
taken
an
anxious
and
uncomfortable
excursion
and
his
voice
had
no
genial
ring
as
he
shouted
his
friend
name
down
the
dark
entrance
of
the
tomb
shaft
in
a
moment
he
heard
a
voice
shouting
hollowly
back
then
a
wavering
spot
of
light
appeared
upon
the
inclined
floor
and
figure
emerged
like
an
apparition
from
the
gloom
i
say
that
you
andy
evidently
he
had
been
snatched
from
sleep
his
dark
hair
was
rumpled
his
face
flushed
and
he
yawned
with
complete
frankness
mclean
knew
a
sudden
yearning
to
put
an
arm
about
him
dear
old
jack
dear
irresponsible
scamp
his
reaction
of
the
irritation
vanished
it
was
so
darned
good
to
see
the
old
chap
again
he
muttered
something
about
being
in
the
vicinity
while
ryder
rousing
to
hostship
called
directions
to
the
cook
boy
to
bring
a
tray
of
luncheon
it
cool
down
here
he
told
mclean
leading
the
way
back
it
was
cool
indeed
in
the
hall
of
offerings
it
was
also
mclean
thought
satisfying
a
recovered
appetite
a
trifle
depressing
they
sat
in
a
small
island
of
light
in
an
ocean
of
gloom
while
about
them
shadowy
columns
towered
to
indistinguishable
heights
and
carvings
projected
their
strange
suggestions
it
seemed
incongruous
to
be
smoking
cigarettes
so
unconcernedly
at
the
feet
of
the
ancient
gods
but
mclean
feeling
of
depression
might
have
been
due
to
his
renewed
awareness
of
catastrophe
for
though
jack
was
here
safe
and
sound
enough
although
a
bit
unlike
himself
in
manner
yet
jack
been
at
that
confounded
reception
in
a
woman
rig
and
jack
had
seen
the
girl
and
talked
with
her
apparently
on
terms
of
understanding
and
if
jack
had
left
cairo
that
night
as
he
said
he
did
claiming
delay
on
the
way
due
to
a
tired
horse
then
jack
knew
nothing
in
the
world
of
the
palace
fire
and
the
girl
sudden
and
tragic
death
and
mclean
would
have
to
tell
him
he
would
have
to
tell
him
that
the
girl
he
was
probably
dreaming
of
in
some
fool
paradise
of
memory
and
hope
was
now
only
a
little
mound
of
dust
in
an
oriental
cemetery
that
a
shaft
of
temporary
wood
already
marked
the
grave
of
aimée
marie
dejane
daughter
of
tewfick
pasha
and
wife
of
hamdi
bey
and
however
much
mclean
sound
senses
might
disapprove
of
the
whole
fantastic
affair
and
his
sober
judgment
commend
the
workings
of
providence
he
loved
his
friend
and
he
feared
that
his
friend
loved
this
lost
girl
he
had
to
end
love
and
hope
and
romance
and
implant
a
desperate
grief
he
thought
very
steadily
of
jinny
jeffries
he
cleared
his
throat
jack
old
man
he
started
to
tell
him
that
there
had
been
a
fire
in
cairo
a
most
shocking
fire
in
a
haremlik
it
seemed
to
him
that
jack
was
not
listening
that
he
had
a
faraway
yet
intent
look
upon
his
face
as
of
one
attending
to
other
things
and
then
suddenly
jack
seemed
to
gather
resolution
and
turned
to
his
friend
with
an
air
of
narration
of
his
own
look
here
mclean
there
something
i
want
to
tell
you
wait
a
minute
now
said
mclean
quietly
i
want
you
to
hear
this
it
was
a
fire
in
the
palace
of
your
friend
hamdi
bey
he
had
jack
attention
now
he
was
fairly
conscious
of
arrested
breath
not
looking
about
him
he
went
grimly
on
the
night
of
the
wedding
a
fire
started
in
the
haremlik
it
was
a
bad
business
a
very
bad
business
jack
for
the
girl
the
girl
hamdi
had
just
married
he
was
conscious
of
jack
look
upon
him
but
he
did
not
turn
to
meet
it
she
died
he
said
heavily
he
buried
her
yesterday
he
thought
that
jack
was
never
going
to
speak
then
died
said
ryder
in
an
odd
voice
i
expect
she
breathed
in
a
bit
of
smoke
said
mclean
trying
for
a
merciful
suggestion
and
he
buried
her
jack
was
like
a
child
trying
to
fit
bewildering
facts
together
mclean
sympathy
hurt
him
like
a
physical
pain
he
wondered
what
it
could
be
like
to
realize
that
some
loved
one
you
had
just
talked
with
in
radiant
life
was
now
gone
utterly
and
then
he
heard
jack
laugh
mad
he
thought
quickly
turning
now
to
look
at
him
ryder
head
was
tilted
back
ryder
shoulders
were
shaking
oh
my
aunt
he
gasped
hysterically
my
aunt
clarissa
is
what
hamdi
says
he
sobered
instantly
and
leaned
towards
mclean
that
looks
as
if
he
done
with
her
what
saving
his
face
that
way
you
sure
it
was
aimée
the
girl
he
had
just
married
not
some
other
girl
some
or
something
and
as
mclean
bewilderedly
muttered
that
he
was
sure
ryder
began
to
laugh
again
to
laugh
jubilantly
joyously
triumphantly
he
given
her
up
he
got
a
saving
explanation
to
thrust
in
the
world
face
oh
blessed
allah
veiler
of
all
that
should
be
veiled
the
man
through
he
had
enough
he
is
going
to
try
to
across
the
bright
oblong
of
the
entrance
a
shadow
appeared
ryder
i
say
ryder
said
a
hurried
voice
thatcher
voice
and
thatcher
came
hastily
forward
in
perturbed
urgency
there
a
lot
of
men
outside
police
and
natives
and
what
not
with
warrants
they
searching
the
place
and
they
want
to
see
you
hang
it
all
ryder
said
thatcher
explosively
but
apologetically
they
say
you
made
off
with
some
sheik
daughter
he
paused
shocked
at
the
monstrosity
of
the
accusation
he
was
a
man
outside
of
his
knowledge
of
antiquities
and
he
evidently
expected
his
young
associate
to
fall
upon
him
and
slay
him
for
the
slander
a
sheik
daughter
said
ryder
in
a
mildly
wondering
voice
from
his
emphasis
one
might
have
inferred
he
was
saying
how
odd
i
do
remember
any
sheik
daughter
a
queer
uncomfortable
flush
spread
fanways
from
thatcher
thin
temples
and
rayed
across
his
high
cheekbones
he
did
not
look
at
either
of
the
men
as
he
murmured
it
most
peculiar
but
that
arab
horse
the
sheik
claims
the
horse
is
his
too
he
says
you
rode
off
on
it
with
his
daughter
that
all
right
said
ryder
absently
i
do
want
the
horse
but
you
say
the
sheik
there
what
does
he
look
like
thin
with
blond
mustaches
oh
no
no
not
at
all
he
is
quite
heavy
and
bearded
if
i
recollect
but
there
a
man
with
a
blond
mustache
who
appears
to
do
the
directing
and
you
mean
they
are
searching
said
ryder
abruptly
you
let
them
in
they
have
warrants
thatcher
protested
and
there
are
proper
policemen
conducting
the
search
my
good
god
where
are
they
now
not
coming
i
do
have
any
policemen
trampling
here
and
meddling
with
my
finds
tell
them
to
clear
out
thatcher
you
know
there
no
sheik
daughter
here
ryder
gave
a
quick
laugh
but
the
impression
of
his
laughter
was
not
as
sharp
as
the
impression
of
his
alarm
i
did
tell
them
it
was
preposterous
thatcher
began
but
you
see
after
finding
the
horse
oh
the
horse
i
got
him
for
a
song
of
course
the
beggar
is
stolen
give
him
back
if
they
claim
him
but
as
for
any
daughter
keep
the
crowd
out
thatcher
i
wo
have
them
here
not
in
these
tombs
i
tell
you
they
are
policemen
they
are
armed
you
ca
resist
how
many
are
they
a
lot
but
they
take
your
word
wo
they
look
here
mclean
ca
you
settle
this
for
me
and
keep
them
out
the
natives
have
been
talking
murmured
thatcher
reddening
still
deeper
and
they
have
said
enough
about
your
riding
in
at
night
and
and
keeping
to
this
tomb
all
day
to
make
the
men
very
suspicious
they
are
watching
this
one
now
then
keep
them
back
long
as
you
can
for
god
sake
entreated
ryder
with
that
strange
passionate
violence
andy
you
do
something
hold
them
back
give
me
time
i
i
got
to
get
some
things
together
i
wo
have
them
at
my
things
hold
them
back
out
here
till
i
come
he
was
gone
gone
tearing
back
into
the
gloom
and
silence
of
his
tomb
and
mclean
and
thatcher
astounded
witnesses
of
his
outburst
turned
speedily
to
the
entrance
avoiding
each
other
eyes
agitatedly
thatcher
was
murmuring
that
ryder
finds
were
valuable
immensely
valuable
and
it
was
disturbing
to
contemplate
any
invasion
and
with
equal
agitation
but
more
mechanical
calm
mclean
was
murmuring
back
that
he
understood
he
quite
understood
as
for
understanding
he
was
stunned
and
dazed
a
sheik
daughter
and
the
father
himself
claiming
her
under
the
direction
of
a
man
and
a
stolen
horse
jack
conceding
the
horse
jack
utterly
upset
at
the
search
party
but
he
himself
had
seen
that
shaft
with
its
inscription
to
aimée
marie
dejane
what
then
in
the
name
of
wonders
did
this
mean
there
could
be
girl
mclean
imagination
faltered
then
dashed
on
at
a
gallop
some
some
perhaps
whom
jack
had
rescued
in
mistaken
chivalry
perhaps
the
french
girl
has
sent
a
maid
on
ahead
mclean
head
was
whirling
now
one
thing
appeared
quite
as
possible
as
another
pasha
daughters
and
sheik
daughters
stolen
horses
and
djinns
and
afrits
and
palaces
and
masquerades
at
wedding
receptions
appeared
upon
the
same
plane
of
feasibility
outwardly
he
was
extremely
calm
calm
and
cold
and
crisp
at
the
mouth
of
the
tomb
he
detained
the
party
of
native
policemen
with
their
of
curious
natives
and
examined
with
great
show
of
circumspection
and
authority
the
perfectly
regular
search
warrants
which
had
been
issued
for
them
at
the
instigation
of
an
apparently
bereft
parent
he
conversed
with
the
alleged
parent
a
stolid
taciturn
native
dignitary
whose
accusations
were
confirmed
by
eagerly
assenting
followers
he
lived
in
a
small
village
not
far
north
of
the
camp
he
had
a
young
daughter
very
beautiful
three
nights
ago
he
had
surprised
her
with
this
young
american
and
they
had
fled
upon
his
noblest
horse
it
was
a
simple
and
direct
story
and
jack
by
his
own
report
had
been
out
upon
the
desert
that
night
had
appeared
upon
the
next
night
with
this
unknown
and
beautiful
horse
and
had
since
kept
to
the
tomb
claiming
illness
in
a
most
persistent
way
the
camp
boys
had
testified
that
he
had
been
vividly
critical
of
the
food
sent
in
to
him
and
that
he
had
required
extraordinary
amounts
of
heated
water
all
of
which
mclean
said
sternly
in
the
vernacular
amounts
to
nothing
unless
you
can
discover
the
girl
and
that
monsieur
said
a
turk
in
the
uniform
of
the
guards
appearing
beside
the
desert
sheik
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
here
to
do
mclean
found
himself
looking
into
a
thin
menacing
face
capped
with
a
red
fez
a
face
deeply
lined
marked
by
light
arrogant
eyes
and
embellished
with
a
huge
blond
mustache
and
your
interest
in
this
monsieur
he
questioned
i
am
a
friend
of
sheik
hassan
said
the
turk
loftily
i
shall
see
that
my
friend
obtains
his
rights
and
in
mclean
other
ear
a
distraught
thatcher
was
murmuring
that
officer
chap
is
hamdi
bey
a
general
of
the
guards
you
know
mclean
this
really
is
you
know
it
is
hamdi
bey
hamdi
bey
two
days
after
his
distressing
loss
befriending
this
sheik
and
trying
to
involve
jack
ryder
in
disgrace
mystifying
mystifying
and
disquieting
yes
disquieting
in
the
face
of
jack
alarm
but
for
that
alarm
mclean
could
have
believed
the
whole
thing
a
farcical
attempt
of
hamdi
to
revenge
himself
upon
ryder
supposing
that
hamdi
had
discovered
ryder
in
his
masquerade
or
else
as
the
prowler
by
night
but
jack
furious
anxiety
to
keep
the
party
out
and
his
dashing
back
ostensibly
to
preserve
his
things
was
it
actually
possible
that
he
that
sheik
daughter
concealed
in
some
nook
or
cranny
of
the
place
mclean
told
himself
that
it
was
preposterous
it
preposterous
but
ryder
had
been
doing
preposterous
things
and
glancing
at
thatcher
he
perceived
that
that
perturbed
and
transparent
gentleman
was
also
telling
himself
that
suspicions
were
preposterous
the
search
party
tiring
of
parley
was
moving
about
the
hall
in
businesslike
inspection
and
then
ryder
reappeared
a
distinctly
alert
but
ryder
who
met
the
interrogations
of
the
police
with
scoffing
and
absolute
denial
but
mclean
was
conscious
that
there
was
something
tense
and
nervous
in
his
alertness
something
wary
and
defensive
in
his
readiness
and
his
own
nerves
began
to
tighten
apprehensively
it
did
not
add
to
his
composure
to
see
ryder
salute
hamdi
bey
with
an
ironic
and
overdone
politeness
ah
monsieur
le
general
we
meet
as
we
parted
in
the
depths
the
general
appeared
to
smile
as
at
some
amiable
pleasantry
but
mclean
caught
the
snarl
of
his
lifted
lip
and
felt
the
currents
of
animosity
so
those
two
had
met
ryder
had
been
discovered
then
mclean
tried
in
futile
bewilderment
to
recall
just
what
amazing
thing
ryder
had
been
saying
when
this
party
had
appeared
he
kept
very
close
at
that
young
man
side
as
the
strange
party
moved
on
into
the
inner
chamber
the
searchers
were
scrupulously
careful
of
the
excavator
finds
they
did
not
finger
a
frieze
nor
disturb
a
single
small
box
of
the
tenderly
packed
potteries
and
beads
and
miniature
boats
but
they
scraped
every
heap
of
dust
to
see
if
it
concealed
an
entrance
they
exhausted
the
resources
of
each
corner
they
circled
every
pillar
shook
out
every
rug
of
jack
blankets
and
required
the
opening
of
the
large
chest
in
which
the
wax
reproductions
of
the
friezes
were
placed
awaiting
transportation
you
will
perceive
messieurs
declared
ryder
in
mocking
irony
that
no
human
being
is
within
this
last
fold
of
wax
especially
a
being
he
added
thoughtfully
with
a
glance
at
the
stolid
sheik
of
the
proportions
of
her
papa
this
daughter
was
she
a
large
young
lady
he
inquired
politely
of
the
arab
the
sheik
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
from
across
his
ample
person
the
general
leaned
forward
she
was
small
monsieur
ryder
he
said
in
silken
tones
but
she
can
raise
a
man
as
high
as
the
gallows
or
as
low
as
the
grave
a
marvel
returned
young
ryder
smoothly
and
was
she
also
of
charm
a
charm
that
could
kindle
fires
it
appeared
to
mclean
that
he
caught
the
flaunting
implications
of
the
taunt
he
wished
to
heaven
that
ryder
would
hold
his
reckless
tongue
ryder
was
turning
now
to
the
official
in
charge
of
the
police
if
you
have
satisfied
yourselves
that
this
place
is
empty
the
man
a
rather
apologetic
pleasant
fellow
shrugged
and
smiled
we
have
examined
all
there
was
a
moment
in
which
the
searchers
regarded
one
another
through
the
gloom
in
the
inquiring
embarrassment
of
the
discountenanced
and
considered
departure
but
hamdi
bey
had
more
insistent
eyes
he
was
circling
the
place
again
like
a
wolf
for
the
scent
flashing
his
search
light
over
the
carved
walls
the
dancing
gleam
picking
out
now
a
relief
of
osiris
now
a
fishing
boat
upon
the
nile
now
the
judgment
hall
of
maat
suddenly
he
stopped
and
began
examining
a
limestone
slab
these
stones
these
have
been
merely
piled
here
he
cried
excitedly
this
is
a
hole
an
entrance
dig
them
out
men
there
is
a
door
there
i
tell
you
hastily
ryder
addressed
the
police
it
is
simply
the
burial
vault
he
told
them
the
sarcophagi
are
there
ready
for
transportation
thatcher
will
tell
you
i
assure
you
it
is
merely
the
actual
tomb
said
thatcher
nervously
i
have
myself
assisted
my
colleague
with
the
preparation
the
slabs
had
been
displaced
now
disclosing
the
small
door
with
its
fine
wrought
stele
hamdi
flashed
a
look
of
triumph
upon
the
man
who
had
obviously
tried
to
conceal
that
door
from
them
a
look
which
ryder
ignored
as
he
turned
to
mclean
that
is
the
door
which
is
sealed
forever
upon
the
dead
and
upon
the
ka
the
spiritual
double
he
said
in
a
low
conversational
tone
it
has
some
remarkable
representations
of
the
jackal
anubis
it
seemed
to
mclean
a
most
extraordinary
time
for
a
disquisition
upon
anubis
if
ryder
was
attempting
to
prove
himself
at
his
ease
he
had
certainly
misjudged
his
manner
damn
anubis
mclean
gave
back
under
his
breath
he
not
the
only
jackal
what
the
devil
the
meaning
of
this
ryder
made
no
reply
the
stone
had
been
pushed
back
and
the
searchers
were
stooping
beneath
the
narrow
entrance
then
as
mclean
head
bent
at
the
door
he
heard
his
friend
whispering
i
say
you
have
a
gun
you
could
slip
me
mutely
he
shook
his
head
and
that
agitated
whisper
died
away
with
the
last
vestige
of
belief
in
ryder
innocence
apprehensively
mclean
glanced
about
that
inner
chamber
he
was
entering
dreading
to
encounter
instant
and
damning
evidence
of
a
girl
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
the
chamber
was
a
small
square
affair
and
at
one
side
stood
the
three
sarcophagi
the
other
halls
had
been
in
total
darkness
but
the
blackness
of
this
place
appeared
something
palpable
and
weighty
and
the
air
had
the
dry
acrid
tang
of
dust
which
has
lain
waiting
for
centuries
it
was
hot
whereas
the
other
chambers
had
been
cool
or
else
mclean
disturbed
blood
was
pumping
too
furiously
through
his
pulses
instinctively
he
drew
close
to
jack
as
the
party
stood
flashing
their
lights
over
the
bare
walls
and
empty
corners
and
then
concentrated
the
pale
illumination
upon
those
caskets
of
the
dead
i
told
you
that
the
place
was
empty
ryder
said
with
distinct
impatience
in
his
voice
and
now
if
you
have
satisfied
yourselves
you
are
in
haste
monsieur
said
hamdi
bey
smooth
voice
if
you
will
permit
us
to
see
what
is
within
he
approached
the
first
sarcophagus
the
sheik
who
appeared
to
have
committed
the
restoration
of
his
daughter
into
the
other
hands
remained
imperturbably
beside
the
entrance
while
the
head
of
the
police
came
forward
to
assist
hamdi
in
raising
the
painted
lid
i
protest
said
ryder
very
sharply
he
stood
upon
the
other
side
of
the
case
eying
them
combatively
it
is
useless
to
disturb
this
lid
i
tell
you
that
the
persians
have
been
considerably
before
you
and
indeed
the
case
was
empty
hamdi
moved
to
the
next
and
again
ryder
took
up
his
post
opposite
again
i
protest
he
insisted
the
least
jar
or
injury
but
the
men
raised
the
lid
and
after
the
briefest
look
moved
on
and
now
ryder
spoke
very
clearly
and
authoritatively
addressing
the
head
of
the
police
i
must
ask
you
to
stop
even
the
dust
that
you
are
disturbing
is
precious
this
thing
has
gone
beyond
all
reason
the
police
official
looked
as
if
he
agreed
with
him
but
hamdi
bey
had
moved
determinedly
to
the
third
sarcophagus
the
official
hesitated
evidenced
discomfort
but
moved
finally
after
the
bey
if
there
is
nothing
here
he
murmured
surely
you
can
not
object
there
is
precious
dust
here
ryder
repeated
you
must
understand
we
see
for
ourselves
said
hamdi
bey
and
now
his
voice
had
a
ring
of
triumphant
steel
through
its
soft
smoothness
stand
aside
this
is
in
the
name
of
the
law
it
seemed
to
mclean
that
for
one
mad
moment
ryder
was
tempted
to
resist
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
torches
he
stood
defiantly
above
the
painted
mummy
case
his
eyes
steadily
upon
the
bey
his
hands
pressing
down
upon
the
vivid
bloom
of
the
dead
pictured
face
then
with
a
beaten
but
ironic
smile
he
stood
aside
slowly
the
men
lifted
the
lid
in
that
moment
mclean
became
aware
that
his
heart
was
pumping
thickly
somewhere
in
his
throat
and
that
the
rest
of
him
was
a
hollow
horrible
void
of
suspense
hamdi
bey
turned
his
arrogant
stare
from
young
ryder
and
looked
down
drawing
closer
fearfully
mclean
eyes
followed
him
he
could
not
believe
their
evidence
his
heart
could
not
stop
its
idiotic
pumping
but
there
he
saw
no
girl
no
pallid
runaway
of
the
harems
but
a
still
form
swathed
in
the
tight
bandages
of
the
ancient
embalmer
a
dry
dusty
little
mummy
creature
blankly
and
inscrutably
confronting
this
unforeseen
resurrection
over
their
dumbfounded
heads
he
heard
young
ryder
mocking
laugh
chapter
xxv
in
cairo
it
good
news
said
miss
jeffries
with
bright
positives
it
was
her
response
to
andrew
mclean
greeting
that
evening
he
had
made
rather
a
tardy
appearance
at
the
hotel
for
there
had
been
an
important
dinner
with
an
important
bank
official
passing
through
cairo
to
escape
from
but
he
arrived
at
last
looking
extraordinarily
well
in
his
very
best
dinner
clothes
and
miss
jeffries
for
all
her
harassment
of
suspense
was
no
woeful
object
in
a
vivacious
blue
evening
frock
with
silvery
gleams
he
safe
absolutely
safe
mclean
confirmed
he
expected
radiance
miss
jeffries
expression
was
arrested
judgment
safe
at
his
camp
i
just
returned
just
in
time
to
dine
i
motored
out
this
morning
oh
it
took
your
whole
day
i
am
so
sorry
for
a
moment
the
girl
appeared
to
concentrate
her
sympathetic
interest
upon
mclean
you
must
simply
hate
me
she
told
him
repentantly
dropping
into
one
of
the
chairs
in
the
corner
she
had
long
been
guarding
do
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
the
horrid
details
uncle
and
aunt
are
in
the
lounge
and
i
should
like
you
to
meet
them
but
they
be
there
forever
and
i
do
want
to
hear
first
was
it
fearfully
hot
oh
rather
murmured
the
young
man
confused
by
this
change
of
interest
i
mean
that
quite
the
usual
thing
is
it
for
deserts
i
got
up
a
good
breeze
going
for
i
was
a
bit
wrought
up
you
know
not
a
soul
in
cairo
had
seen
jack
since
that
day
and
he
was
out
at
his
camp
said
jinny
thoughtfully
how
how
long
had
he
been
there
he
says
he
started
that
night
said
mclean
oh
that
night
that
was
rather
sudden
was
it
jack
sudden
you
know
mentioned
his
friend
uncomfortably
and
he
had
a
lot
of
finds
to
pack
up
for
transport
they
are
taking
their
stuff
to
the
museum
and
jack
had
been
away
so
long
here
in
the
city
no
wonder
i
did
hear
then
said
the
girl
with
a
laugh
in
which
it
would
have
taken
an
acuter
ear
than
mclean
to
detect
the
secret
clamor
of
chagrin
and
humiliation
of
course
she
had
jack
to
be
safe
but
he
might
have
been
ill
or
away
on
some
official
summons
just
back
at
his
diggings
gone
off
on
an
impulse
with
no
thought
to
let
her
know
and
she
had
rushed
to
mclean
with
her
silly
worries
and
her
anxious
concern
which
he
had
probably
taken
for
a
tender
interest
heaven
knows
what
disillusionizing
thing
jack
had
said
to
him
that
day
men
were
too
hateful
and
now
mclean
had
come
dutifully
to
report
that
the
man
she
was
so
worried
about
was
quite
well
and
busy
thank
you
only
he
had
overlooked
any
friendship
for
her
and
so
had
sent
no
word
in
jinny
ears
was
the
rush
of
the
furies
wings
but
on
lips
was
a
proud
little
smile
and
her
bright
look
was
a
shining
shield
for
the
wounds
of
the
spirit
that
a
comfort
she
said
with
pleasant
friendly
warmth
you
do
know
how
horridly
responsible
i
felt
really
jack
ought
to
have
let
me
know
but
that
jack
all
over
he
never
grown
up
he
not
had
much
time
returned
mclean
from
the
height
of
his
years
he
never
will
said
jinny
sagely
not
until
well
not
until
he
meets
some
girl
you
know
who
will
make
him
feel
really
responsible
it
occurred
unhappily
to
mclean
that
the
girl
jack
had
been
meeting
so
assiduously
of
late
had
certainly
not
added
to
his
claims
to
responsibility
steadily
he
guarded
silence
there
are
ice
fields
on
mont
blanc
where
a
whisper
precipitates
an
avalanche
and
mclean
had
no
intention
of
starting
anything
in
his
friend
slippery
field
of
affairs
i
have
spent
more
time
miss
jeffries
was
confiding
brightly
for
those
imperative
reasons
of
her
own
so
obscure
to
the
bewildered
young
man
introducing
jack
to
nice
girls
but
it
never
takes
not
seriously
he
a
perfectly
dear
friend
but
he
does
care
anything
really
about
girls
and
he
does
need
somebody
to
get
him
out
of
his
antiquities
and
his
dusty
old
diggings
but
of
course
you
think
i
am
a
sentimental
thing
mclean
did
not
tell
her
what
he
thought
he
was
still
fascinatedly
engrossed
with
her
revelation
of
the
impeccable
platonic
basis
of
her
friendship
his
mood
of
complicated
emotion
lightened
and
brightened
and
at
the
same
time
an
amazed
wonder
unfolded
its
astonishment
he
marveled
at
his
friend
to
turn
to
something
fantastic
something
bizarre
for
so
he
thought
of
that
veiled
girl
of
the
harem
when
he
had
this
miss
jeffries
for
a
friend
but
probably
the
young
lady
herself
had
never
given
him
the
least
encouragement
women
are
not
easily
moved
to
romance
for
men
they
have
always
regarded
as
brothers
and
he
could
see
that
her
feeling
for
jack
was
the
warm
honest
sisterly
affection
of
utter
frankness
the
worse
for
jack
for
now
there
seemed
no
ministering
angel
to
mend
his
troubled
future
it
was
not
only
ryder
troubled
future
that
troubled
mclean
it
was
also
ryder
troubled
present
he
was
very
far
from
easy
in
his
mind
about
him
after
that
mystifying
performance
in
the
tomb
he
had
not
wanted
to
leave
without
a
frank
explanation
but
there
had
been
no
moment
for
revelation
thatcher
had
hung
about
them
and
hamdi
bey
of
all
men
had
requested
a
place
in
mclean
motor
for
the
return
to
cairo
and
that
dinner
engagement
had
pressed
he
could
have
abandoned
it
for
any
real
reason
but
jack
had
assured
him
that
there
was
none
get
the
old
devil
out
of
here
had
been
jack
furious
appeal
referring
to
hamdi
deny
everything
to
him
only
get
him
out
and
mclean
had
got
him
out
the
sheik
and
his
followers
after
a
murmurous
conference
with
the
bey
had
galloped
off
the
police
had
turned
towards
their
post
and
hamdi
had
accompanied
mclean
to
the
nearest
village
and
his
waiting
motor
clearly
he
had
wanted
to
talk
to
mclean
and
mclean
was
not
sorry
for
the
opportunity
to
exchange
implications
the
bey
had
unfolded
his
sympathetic
friendship
for
the
sheik
mclean
had
unfolded
a
cold
surprise
that
anything
so
disgraceful
should
be
attributed
to
such
a
prominent
archaeologist
the
bey
had
produced
the
evidence
and
mclean
had
produced
a
skeptical
wonder
and
then
a
thoughtful
wonder
if
the
british
government
had
not
better
take
the
matter
up
and
sift
it
for
the
benefit
of
all
concerned
clearly
the
thing
could
not
go
on
ryder
could
not
accept
such
a
rumor
against
his
reputation
yes
he
thought
he
would
advise
ryder
to
take
the
matter
up
and
there
he
perceived
that
even
the
suave
and
politic
hamdi
squirmed
doubtless
to
the
turk
mclean
represented
british
prestige
and
political
power
and
all
sorts
of
unknown
influence
and
native
testimony
while
voluable
and
unscrupulous
had
a
way
of
offering
confused
discrepancies
to
the
coldly
questioning
investigators
of
the
law
and
with
no
real
evidence
against
ryder
the
matter
of
the
sheik
daughter
mclean
perceived
would
be
dropped
unless
the
girl
whatever
girl
they
sought
could
be
discovered
if
hamdi
wished
to
pay
off
some
score
against
the
american
he
would
choose
other
weapons
mclean
reflected
upon
the
bey
capacity
for
assassination
or
poisoning
while
he
bade
him
farewell
before
the
dark
wall
of
his
palace
entrance
between
them
had
passed
no
reference
to
the
bey
recent
loss
since
it
would
not
have
been
etiquette
for
him
to
mention
the
bey
wife
he
judged
it
equally
inadvisable
to
refer
to
her
ashes
the
whole
affair
was
so
wrapped
in
darkness
that
he
could
not
decide
upon
any
creditable
explanation
it
would
have
to
wait
until
he
saw
ryder
in
the
next
day
or
two
for
ryder
had
told
him
he
would
try
to
get
in
with
his
finds
as
soon
as
possible
but
no
matter
how
he
tried
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
he
had
found
himself
asking
through
the
courses
of
that
important
dinner
and
now
in
the
pauses
of
his
conversation
with
miss
jeffries
was
there
really
some
girl
had
he
only
dreamed
that
tense
anxiety
of
jack
had
jack
led
them
on
for
his
own
young
amusement
but
it
was
not
long
possible
to
maintain
an
inner
communion
with
jinny
jeffries
for
a
a
divided
mind
could
not
companion
her
swift
flights
and
sudden
tangents
deriding
now
her
silly
anxieties
and
deploring
unnecessary
trip
she
had
branched
into
the
consideration
of
how
busy
mclean
must
be
and
mclean
found
himself
somehow
embarked
in
sketchy
descriptions
of
the
institution
of
which
miss
jeffries
seemed
to
think
he
was
the
backbone
and
of
its
very
interesting
work
throughout
the
country
and
as
he
had
talked
he
found
himself
noticing
things
that
he
had
never
noticed
before
about
girls
the
wave
of
bright
hair
against
a
flushed
cheek
the
dimples
in
a
rounded
arm
the
slim
grace
of
crossed
ankles
and
feet
and
you
live
all
alone
in
that
big
house
jinny
was
murmuring
not
exactly
alone
mclean
smiled
there
mohammed
and
hassan
and
abdullah
and
alewa
and
what
you
call
him
when
you
are
in
a
hurry
laughed
the
girl
it
was
a
tremendously
pleasant
evening
he
had
expected
constraint
and
secret
embarrassment
and
he
had
discovered
this
delightful
interest
and
bright
vivacity
and
if
beneath
that
interest
and
vivacity
something
lay
forever
stilled
and
chilled
in
miss
jeffries
breast
like
a
poor
hidden
corpse
beneath
bright
roses
why
at
two
and
twenty
expectancies
flourish
so
gayly
that
one
lone
bud
is
not
long
missed
and
chagrin
is
sometimes
a
salutary
transient
shower
and
is
all
the
more
delicate
for
a
dimming
cloud
moreover
mclean
unconscious
absorption
was
balm
and
blessing
when
in
startled
realization
of
time
and
place
he
rose
at
last
and
she
murmured
laughing
and
after
all
you
never
met
aunt
and
uncle
he
felt
a
queer
blush
tingle
his
cheek
bones
and
a
daring
impulse
shape
the
thought
aloud
that
in
that
case
he
must
come
again
we
here
five
days
more
said
jinny
the
explicit
thoughtfully
he
repeated
five
days
and
said
farewell
now
if
he
decorously
waits
to
the
next
to
the
last
day
murmured
jinny
to
herself
her
opinion
of
the
scots
race
hanging
in
the
balance
he
did
but
it
was
not
the
initiative
of
the
scots
race
which
brought
him
to
her
late
that
very
next
afternoon
but
a
soiled
looking
note
which
he
held
crumpled
in
his
hand
he
found
her
at
tea
upon
the
veranda
with
her
aunt
and
uncle
and
while
he
made
conversation
with
the
pendletons
he
gave
miss
jeffries
the
note
from
our
friend
ryder
he
said
with
forced
lightness
it
explains
itself
but
it
certainly
did
not
it
was
a
hasty
scrawl
to
mclean
saying
that
ryder
was
on
his
way
with
the
museum
finds
and
sending
this
ahead
by
runner
and
that
mclean
must
positively
be
at
the
cairo
museum
to
meet
him
at
five
and
would
he
please
stop
on
the
way
and
call
at
his
hotel
upon
a
miss
jeffries
and
borrow
a
woman
cloak
and
hat
and
veil
or
if
she
was
in
get
them
elsewhere
what
is
it
another
masquerade
said
jinny
blankly
mclean
looked
mutely
at
her
and
shook
his
head
but
within
him
horrific
suspicion
was
raging
like
a
forest
fire
he
continued
his
converse
with
the
pendletons
while
jinny
went
for
the
things
she
returned
with
a
small
bag
containing
coat
and
hat
and
veil
and
the
announcement
that
she
would
go
right
over
with
him
if
the
things
are
right
i
know
what
he
wants
she
declared
and
then
smiling
what
you
suppose
he
is
up
to
now
mclean
felt
that
he
did
want
to
know
and
most
positively
he
did
want
her
to
know
but
having
lacked
the
instant
inspiration
to
deny
her
he
could
only
acquiesce
and
wonder
why
he
thought
up
some
brilliant
excuse
he
looked
helplessly
at
the
pendletons
but
they
merely
murmured
their
adieux
and
their
independent
niece
accompanied
mclean
to
his
waiting
carriage
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
the
caravan
was
before
them
a
long
line
of
camels
was
just
turning
in
the
gates
and
before
the
steps
of
a
back
entrance
other
camels
kneeling
with
that
profound
and
squealing
resentment
with
which
even
the
camel
most
exhausted
moments
oppose
commands
were
being
relieved
of
their
huge
loads
by
natives
under
the
very
minute
and
exact
direction
of
thatcher
and
within
the
entrance
a
young
man
with
rumpled
dark
hair
and
a
thin
bronzed
face
flushed
with
impatience
was
imperiously
conveying
the
arabs
who
were
bearing
the
precious
sarcophagi
over
his
shoulder
he
caught
sight
of
the
two
arrivals
i
asked
for
motors
and
they
furnished
these
he
cried
disgustedly
gesturing
at
the
enduring
camels
it
took
us
all
day
though
we
half
killed
the
brutes
hello
jinny
did
you
bring
the
things
with
light
casualness
he
accepted
her
appearance
on
the
scene
that
glitter
in
his
bright
hazel
eyes
was
not
for
that
come
in
both
of
you
he
called
plunging
after
his
men
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
mclean
waited
with
miss
jeffries
until
the
men
had
reached
the
top
and
deposited
their
burdens
in
the
room
and
in
the
manner
which
ryder
was
specifying
so
crisply
and
then
they
came
mechanically
up
mclean
had
the
automatic
feeling
of
a
mere
super
in
a
well
rehearsed
scene
he
had
no
idea
of
plot
or
appearance
but
his
rôle
of
dumb
subservience
was
clearly
defined
you
understand
ryder
was
calling
to
the
men
nothing
more
goes
in
this
room
all
else
down
stairs
come
in
he
said
hurriedly
to
his
waiting
friends
and
shutting
the
door
swiftly
behind
them
of
course
this
does
lock
he
muttered
jinny
you
stand
here
do
and
if
any
one
tries
to
come
in
tell
them
they
ca
tell
them
you
say
they
ca
questioned
jinny
a
little
helplessly
no
no
not
that
tell
them
you
are
using
the
room
tell
them
said
ryder
with
very
brisk
and
serious
inspiration
tell
them
your
petticoat
is
coming
off
why
jack
ryder
said
jinny
indignantly
nonsense
said
he
to
her
indignation
do
you
remember
when
your
aunt
petticoat
came
off
on
the
way
to
church
it
happens
but
it
does
run
in
families
her
protest
fell
apparently
upon
the
back
of
his
head
he
had
turned
to
the
last
sarcophagus
and
was
slipping
his
fingers
beneath
the
lid
here
andy
he
said
quickly
i
had
it
wedged
so
it
was
tight
shut
but
it
been
so
infernally
hot
and
dusty
he
was
tremendously
troubled
it
was
not
the
heat
which
had
brought
those
fine
beads
of
moisture
to
his
brow
white
above
the
line
of
brown
and
drawn
such
a
pale
ring
about
his
mouth
mclean
saw
that
the
slim
wiry
wrists
which
supported
the
case
top
were
shaking
gently
now
he
murmured
and
the
lid
was
lifted
and
laid
aside
the
same
dark
unstirring
form
of
the
tomb
scene
the
same
dry
dusty
little
mummy
but
with
hands
strangely
reckless
for
an
archaeologist
dealing
with
the
priceless
stuff
of
time
ryder
tore
at
those
bandages
he
unwrapped
he
unwound
and
in
a
flash
to
mclean
tense
expectant
nerves
it
was
like
a
scene
at
the
pantomime
he
had
divined
it
he
had
foreseen
and
yet
there
was
the
shock
and
eerie
thrill
of
magic
the
appealing
unreality
of
the
supernatural
in
the
revelation
in
a
wave
of
an
enchanter
wand
the
mummy
was
gone
and
in
its
place
lay
a
sleeping
beauty
the
dark
hair
in
sculptured
closeness
to
the
head
the
long
black
lashes
sweeping
the
still
cheeks
chapter
xxvi
the
painted
case
she
fainted
said
ryder
in
a
voice
that
shook
from
his
pocket
he
drew
swiftly
a
thermos
bottle
but
before
the
top
was
off
those
long
lashes
fluttered
and
from
under
their
shadow
the
soft
dark
eyes
looked
up
at
him
with
a
smile
of
very
gallant
reassurance
not
faint
said
the
girl
in
a
breath
of
a
voice
but
it
was
so
long
so
hot
drink
this
ryder
slipped
an
arm
about
her
offering
the
filled
top
of
the
thermos
it
over
all
over
he
murmured
as
she
drank
you
safe
now
safe
you
at
the
museum
then
we
get
you
to
the
hotel
hotel
the
girl
echoed
with
a
faint
implication
of
humor
in
that
silver
bell
of
a
voice
she
put
her
hands
to
her
hair
and
to
her
face
in
which
the
hues
of
life
mingled
with
the
pallor
of
exhaustion
on
her
small
fingers
sparkled
the
gleam
of
diamonds
and
from
her
slender
arms
fell
back
the
gold
and
jade
tissues
of
her
chiffon
robe
to
mclean
she
had
increasingly
the
appearance
of
a
creature
of
enchantments
and
to
see
that
young
loveliness
in
its
strange
gleam
of
color
lying
against
his
friend
supporting
tan
linen
arm
sardonically
his
eyes
sought
ryder
so
that
was
your
mummy
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
ryder
had
withdrawn
his
arm
the
two
men
faced
each
other
across
the
girl
i
was
in
a
blue
funk
you
see
i
was
hiding
her
in
the
inner
chamber
until
i
could
smuggle
her
away
and
when
those
wolves
came
on
the
scent
and
not
an
instant
to
lose
i
got
the
bandages
off
the
real
mummy
and
about
aimée
lord
it
was
a
close
call
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
had
a
gun
i
had
a
thing
and
i
had
to
grin
and
play
it
through
and
i
was
deathly
afraid
of
thatcher
thatcher
yes
thatcher
you
see
i
popped
the
mummy
into
a
case
without
its
bandages
and
if
thatcher
had
glimpsed
that
he
have
said
something
oh
innocently
that
would
have
given
the
show
away
he
knew
there
was
only
one
mummy
and
it
was
wrapped
but
the
lord
was
with
me
the
men
opened
the
empty
case
first
and
at
the
second
they
said
nothing
to
show
it
was
empty
and
thatcher
did
look
in
then
they
went
on
to
the
third
and
me
when
i
heard
those
voices
i
stopped
breathing
said
the
girl
but
i
shook
so
i
thought
they
would
think
that
mummy
was
coming
to
life
and
the
dust
oh
it
was
almost
beyond
my
force
not
to
sneeze
you
have
sneezed
us
to
kingdom
come
said
ryder
gayly
now
but
i
did
not
she
protested
i
lay
there
and
thought
of
hamdi
looking
down
upon
me
and
my
flesh
crept
oh
it
was
terrible
and
yet
it
was
funny
funny
mclean
gazed
in
sardonic
astonishment
upon
the
two
young
creatures
with
such
misguided
humor
that
they
found
something
funny
in
this
appalling
business
flying
from
palaces
hiding
in
tombs
taking
a
mummy
place
beneath
the
dusty
bandages
of
the
dead
funny
and
yet
there
was
laughter
in
their
young
eyes
when
they
looked
at
each
other
and
a
curve
of
astounding
amusement
in
their
lips
it
touched
mclean
to
wonder
it
touched
him
queerly
to
an
odd
and
aching
pain
for
he
saw
suddenly
that
he
was
looking
upon
something
deathless
and
imperishable
yet
fragile
and
fleeting
as
the
breath
of
time
they
were
so
young
so
absorbed
so
oblivious
he
had
forgotten
jinny
jeffries
so
too
not
for
the
first
time
alas
had
ryder
now
her
clear
voice
from
the
doorway
made
them
start
you
might
present
me
jack
ryder
turned
so
did
the
girl
in
the
painted
case
and
her
eyes
widened
with
a
startled
surprise
the
doorway
had
not
been
within
her
vision
jinny
was
leaning
back
against
the
door
her
hand
behind
her
on
the
knob
she
was
to
guard
her
figure
still
rigid
with
astonishment
i
did
know
you
you
dug
them
up
alive
she
said
with
a
quiver
of
uncertain
humor
my
dear
jinny
i
had
for
miss
jeffries
let
me
present
you
to
mademoiselle
delcassé
said
jack
gravely
i
know
that
you
met
her
the
day
of
her
reception
only
in
that
moment
did
jinny
place
the
haunting
recollection
but
she
was
burned
she
was
killed
she
protested
shaken
now
with
excitement
she
was
not
burned
although
there
was
a
fire
the
man
who
called
himself
her
husband
pretended
she
was
killed
in
order
to
save
his
pride
for
she
escaped
from
him
and
he
tried
to
get
her
back
setting
another
man
a
false
father
after
her
with
lying
witnesses
oh
it
a
long
story
so
i
had
to
hide
her
in
this
case
but
jack
you
why
were
hiding
her
did
you
get
her
out
stammered
jinny
the
night
of
that
reception
you
see
i
knew
she
was
truly
a
french
girl
who
had
been
stolen
by
tewfick
pasha
and
brought
up
as
his
daughter
oh
that
a
long
story
too
but
at
mclean
i
had
happened
on
the
agents
who
were
searching
for
her
from
her
aunt
in
france
and
so
i
knew
and
at
the
reception
when
i
found
she
hated
that
marriage
i
stayed
behind
and
and
managed
to
get
her
away
thus
lightly
did
ryder
indicate
the
dangers
of
that
night
so
she
could
escape
to
france
oh
france
said
jinny
she
could
be
forgiven
for
the
tone
she
had
been
kept
shamefully
in
the
dark
misled
ignored
she
had
been
a
catspaw
a
bystander
not
that
she
cared
not
that
she
would
let
them
think
for
a
minute
that
she
cared
but
as
for
this
talk
of
france
her
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
girl
in
the
mummy
case
and
jinny
found
herself
looking
not
at
the
interloper
the
enchantress
but
at
a
very
young
frightened
girl
lost
in
a
strange
world
but
resolved
upon
courage
she
saw
more
than
the
men
could
see
she
saw
the
loveliness
the
helplessness
and
she
saw
too
the
sensitive
dignity
the
delicate
defensive
spirit
really
she
was
a
child
and
to
have
gone
through
so
much
dared
such
danger
she
remembered
that
dark
forbidding
palace
the
guarded
doors
the
hideous
blacks
and
that
bright
smiling
figure
in
its
misty
veil
and
now
that
little
figure
sat
in
its
strange
hiding
place
confronting
her
with
a
lost
child
eyes
into
jinny
bright
gray
eyes
came
a
mist
of
tears
she
was
queerly
moved
it
was
a
mingled
emotion
but
if
some
drops
for
her
own
disconcertment
were
mingled
with
the
warm
prompting
of
pity
her
compassion
was
none
the
less
true
i
be
so
glad
to
do
anything
i
can
to
help
she
said
impulsively
if
you
have
no
friends
to
trust
in
cairo
i
have
no
friends
to
trust
beyond
this
room
said
the
girl
then
i
take
you
to
the
hotel
with
me
you
can
register
as
one
of
our
party
and
keep
your
room
till
we
leave
we
are
going
in
four
days
now
and
oh
i
know
you
can
cross
on
the
same
steamer
with
us
to
europe
for
there
a
woman
at
the
hotel
who
wants
to
give
up
her
transportation
and
go
on
to
the
holy
land
she
was
moaning
about
it
only
this
noon
it
would
all
fit
in
beautifully
it
seemed
to
mclean
that
an
angel
from
heaven
was
revealing
her
blessed
goodness
ryder
took
the
revelation
delightedly
for
granted
bully
for
you
jinny
he
said
warmly
i
knew
i
could
count
on
you
if
for
one
moment
a
twinge
of
wry
reminder
recalled
that
she
had
never
been
able
exactly
to
count
upon
him
it
did
not
dim
his
mood
he
was
alight
with
triumph
i
see
to
the
transportation
he
said
quickly
doing
mental
arithmetic
about
present
sums
in
the
bank
and
we
wo
wire
your
aunt
until
you
safely
out
of
egypt
better
send
a
wireless
from
the
ship
i
think
your
aunt
is
near
paris
we
are
going
to
hurry
to
paris
said
jinny
that
was
our
regular
plan
and
london
said
mclean
london
later
of
course
cathedrals
lakes
and
universities
then
london
i
shall
be
in
london
said
mclean
thoughtfully
in
june
if
you
are
not
too
occupied
with
cathedrals
said
miss
jeffries
where
are
the
things
demanded
ryder
ruthlessly
and
thus
recalled
jinny
produced
the
bag
mclean
moved
toward
the
door
we
might
go
and
mount
guard
in
the
corridor
he
suggested
and
he
and
jinny
stepped
outside
back
into
the
everyday
world
of
egypt
where
nothing
at
all
had
been
happening
but
the
arrival
of
a
caravan
from
the
excavations
within
the
room
ryder
stooped
and
lifted
the
girl
from
the
case
and
set
her
lightly
on
the
floor
ruefully
she
shook
out
the
torn
chiffons
of
that
french
audacity
of
a
robe
and
with
a
whimsical
smile
surveyed
the
soiled
little
slippers
that
she
had
discarded
in
her
disguise
when
she
had
ridden
behind
the
turbaned
ryder
upon
the
arab
horse
so
little
time
ago
and
yet
so
long
away
under
her
long
lashes
she
looked
up
at
the
young
man
who
had
set
the
old
life
crumbling
about
her
at
a
touch
wistfulness
edged
the
brave
smile
with
which
she
murmured
and
so
it
is
all
arranged
so
quick
i
am
safe
i
go
to
the
hotel
with
that
nice
girl
and
i
wo
be
able
to
see
you
he
said
suddenly
but
you
have
seen
me
monsieur
these
many
days
seen
you
i
have
seen
you
i
sat
outside
a
tomb
on
guard
i
marched
beside
a
mummy
case
and
and
we
said
so
little
it
was
true
they
had
said
little
the
hours
had
been
absorbed
in
action
their
words
had
always
been
of
explanation
of
reassurance
of
anxious
planning
of
the
future
the
future
after
safety
had
been
achieved
they
had
said
nothing
it
had
all
been
uncertain
nebulous
vague
and
now
it
was
upon
them
and
i
have
never
said
thank
you
she
murmured
i
i
think
i
began
by
saying
thank
you
monsieur
i
remember
saying
that
my
education
had
proceeded
to
the
ts
if
if
only
you
never
want
to
unsay
it
he
muttered
you
know
what
ahead
life
so
uncertain
no
i
do
not
know
what
is
ahead
she
told
him
but
i
am
free
free
for
whatever
will
come
the
brightness
of
that
freedom
shone
suddenly
from
her
upturned
face
anything
is
better
than
that
man
she
vowed
even
if
my
aunt
that
madame
delcassé
should
not
like
me
you
see
i
have
thought
of
everything
and
i
am
not
afraid
like
you
she
love
you
said
ryder
bitterly
she
go
mad
over
you
and
give
you
all
she
has
she
marry
you
to
a
count
another
marriage
aimée
raised
brows
of
mockery
but
i
am
through
with
the
marriages
of
convenience
you
so
lovely
darling
that
you
have
the
world
at
your
feet
said
the
young
man
huskily
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
could
not
hide
their
pain
oh
i
you
it
not
fair
he
muttered
incoherently
he
had
meant
ever
since
that
sobering
moment
of
guardianship
in
the
desert
to
be
very
fair
he
would
not
bind
her
with
a
word
a
touch
not
since
that
impulsive
clasp
of
reunion
in
the
palace
had
he
touched
her
in
caress
with
the
reverence
of
his
deep
tenderness
he
had
served
her
in
the
tomb
meaning
to
deny
his
heart
to
delay
its
revelation
to
wait
upon
her
freedom
and
her
youth
nobly
he
had
resolved
but
now
parting
was
upon
him
it
not
fair
to
you
he
said
desperately
and
drew
closer
for
at
his
blurted
words
her
look
had
magically
changed
the
defensive
lightness
was
fled
a
breathless
wonder
shone
out
at
him
a
delicious
shyness
brushed
with
dancing
expectation
like
the
gleam
of
a
butterfly
wing
no
glamorous
moonlight
was
about
them
now
no
scented
shadowy
garden
but
the
enchantment
was
there
in
the
bare
and
dusty
room
with
its
grim
old
mummy
cases
the
enchantment
and
the
very
flame
of
youth
sweet
i
be
on
the
ship
i
wait
till
you
are
ready
he
vowed
and
at
her
low
murmur
ready
he
gave
back
ready
for
love
with
a
boy
stammer
over
the
first
sound
of
that
word
between
them
but
what
is
this
now
she
said
wondering
yet
with
a
little
elfish
gleam
of
laughter
but
love
his
last
resolve
went
to
the
winds
and
as
his
arms
closed
about
her
as
he
held
to
his
heart
all
that
young
loveliness
that
had
been
his
despair
and
his
delight
there
was
more
than
joy
in
the
confused
tumult
of
his
youth
there
was
the
supreme
exultation
of
triumphant
daring
for
he
had
opened
the
forbidden
door
he
had
challenged
the
adventure
and
overcome
the
risk
he
had
won
and
he
would
hold
his
winnings
aimée
he
whispered
aimée
beloved
