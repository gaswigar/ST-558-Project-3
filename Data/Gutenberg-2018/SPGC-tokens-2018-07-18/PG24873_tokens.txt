a

of

it
was
the
forenoon
of
a
hazy
breathless
day
and
dan
phillips
was
trouting
up
one
of
the
back
creeks
of
the
carleton
pond
it
was
somewhat
cooler
up
the
creek
than
out
on
the
main
body
of
water
for
the
tall
birches
and
willows
crowding
down
to
the
brim
threw
cool
green
shadows
across
it
and
shut
out
the
scorching
glare
while
a
stray
breeze
now
and
then
rippled
down
the
wooded
slopes
rustling
the
beech
leaves
with
an
airy
pleasant
sound
out
in
the
pond
the
glassy
water
creamed
and
shimmered
in
the
hot
sun
unrippled
by
the
faintest
breath
of
air
across
the
soft
pearly
tints
of
the
horizon
blurred
the
smoke
of
the
big
factory
chimneys
that
were
owned
by
walters
to
whom
the
pond
and
adjacent
property
also
belonged
walters
was
a
comparative
stranger
in
carleton
having
but
recently
purchased
the
factories
from
the
heirs
of
the
previous
owner
but
he
had
been
in
charge
long
enough
to
establish
a
reputation
for
sternness
and
inflexibility
in
all
his
business
dealings
one
or
two
of
his
employees
who
had
been
discharged
by
him
on
what
they
deemed
insufficient
grounds
helped
to
deepen
the
impression
that
he
was
an
unjust
and
arbitrary
man
merciless
to
all
offenders
and
intolerant
of
the
slightest
infringement
of
his
rules
dan
phillips
had
been
on
the
pond
ever
since
sunrise
the
trout
had
risen
well
in
the
early
morning
but
as
the
day
wore
on
growing
hotter
and
hotter
they
refused
to
bite
and
for
half
an
hour
dan
had
not
caught
one
he
had
a
goodly
string
of
them
already
however
and
he
surveyed
them
with
satisfaction
as
he
rowed
his
leaky
little
skiff
to
the
shore
of
the
creek
pretty
good
catch
he
soliloquized
best
i
had
this
summer
so
far
that
big
spotted
one
must
weigh
near
a
pound
he
a
beauty
they
a
good
price
over
at
the
hotels
now
too
i
go
home
and
get
my
dinner
and
go
straight
over
with
them
that
leave
me
time
for
another
try
at
them
about
sunset
whew
how
hot
it
is
i
must
take
ella
may
home
a
bunch
of
them
blue
flags
they
real
handsome
he
tied
his
skiff
under
the
crowding
alders
gathered
a
big
bunch
of
the
purple
flag
lilies
with
their
silky
petals
and
started
homeward
whistling
cheerily
as
he
stepped
briskly
along
the
wood
path
that
wound
up
the
hill
under
the
beeches
and
firs
he
was
a
freckled
sunburned
lad
of
thirteen
years
his
neighbours
all
said
that
danny
was
as
smart
as
a
steel
trap
and
immediately
added
that
they
wondered
where
he
got
his
smartness
from
certainly
not
from
his
father
the
elder
phillips
had
been
denominated
shiftless
and
by
all
who
ever
had
any
dealings
with
him
in
his
unlucky
aimless
life
one
of
those
improvident
easygoing
souls
who
sit
contentedly
down
to
breakfast
with
a
very
faint
idea
where
their
dinner
is
to
come
from
when
he
had
died
no
one
had
missed
him
unless
it
were
his
patient
wife
who
bravely
faced
her
hard
lot
and
toiled
unremittingly
to
keep
a
home
for
her
two
children
dan
and
a
girl
two
years
younger
who
was
a
helpless
cripple
suffering
from
some
form
of
spinal
disease
dan
who
was
old
and
steady
for
his
years
had
gone
manfully
to
work
to
assist
his
mother
though
he
had
been
disappointed
in
all
his
efforts
to
obtain
steady
employment
he
was
active
and
obliging
and
earned
many
a
small
amount
by
odd
jobs
around
the
village
and
by
helping
the
carleton
farmers
in
planting
and
harvest
for
the
last
two
years
however
his
most
profitable
source
of
summer
income
had
been
the
trout
pond
the
former
owner
had
allowed
anyone
who
wished
to
fish
in
his
pond
and
dan
made
a
regular
business
of
it
selling
his
trout
at
the
big
hotels
over
at
mosquito
lake
this
in
spite
of
its
unattractive
name
was
a
popular
summer
resort
and
dan
always
found
a
ready
market
for
his
catch
when
walters
purchased
the
property
it
somehow
never
occurred
to
dan
that
the
new
owner
might
not
be
so
complaisant
as
his
predecessor
in
the
matter
of
the
best
trouting
pond
in
the
country
to
be
sure
dan
often
wondered
why
it
was
the
pond
was
so
deserted
this
summer
he
could
not
recall
having
seen
a
single
person
on
it
save
himself
still
it
did
not
cross
his
mind
that
there
could
be
any
particular
reason
for
this
he
always
fished
up
in
the
cool
dim
creeks
which
long
experience
had
taught
him
were
best
for
trout
and
came
and
went
by
a
convenient
wood
path
but
he
had
no
thought
of
concealment
in
so
doing
he
would
not
have
cared
had
all
carleton
seen
him
he
had
done
very
well
with
his
fish
so
far
and
prices
for
trout
at
the
lake
went
up
every
day
dan
was
an
enterprising
boy
and
a
general
favourite
with
the
hotel
owners
they
knew
that
he
could
always
be
depended
on
phillips
met
him
at
the
door
when
he
reached
home
see
mother
said
dan
exultantly
as
he
held
up
his
fish
just
look
at
that
fellow
will
you
a
pound
if
he
an
ounce
i
ought
to
get
a
good
price
for
these
i
can
tell
you
let
me
have
my
dinner
now
and
i
go
right
over
to
the
lake
with
them
it
a
long
walk
for
you
danny
replied
his
mother
pityingly
and
it
too
hot
to
go
so
far
i
afraid
you
get
or
something
you
better
wait
till
the
cool
of
the
evening
looking
real
pale
and
thin
this
while
back
oh

mother
assured
dan
cheerfully
i
do
mind
the
heat

bit
a
fellow
must
put
up
with
some
inconveniences

till

bring
home
the
money
for
these
fish
and
i
mean
to
have
another
catch

wish

hard
mother

take
it
easier

there
at
the
factory

his
flags
and
went
into
the
little
room
where
his
sister
lay

brought

he
picked
up
a
folded
newspaper
from
the
table
oh
that
only
an
old
lake
answered
phillips
as
she
placed
the
potatoes
on
the
table
and
wiped
her
moist
hot
face
with
the
corner
of
her
gingham
apron
letty
mills
brought
it
in
around
a
parcel
this
morning
it
four
weeks
old
but
i
kept
it
to
read
if
i
ever
get
time
it
so
seldom
we
see
a
paper
of
any
kind
nowadays
but
i
have
looked
at
it
yet
why
danny
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
for
dan
who
had
opened
the
paper
and
glanced
over
the
first
page
suddenly
gave
a
choked
exclamation
and
turned
pale
staring
stupidly
at
the
sheet
before
him
see
mother
he
gasped
as
she
came
up
in
alarm
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
this
is
what
they
read
notice
anyone
found
fishing
on
my
pond
at
carleton
after
date
will
be
prosecuted
according
to
law
without
respect
of
persons
june
first
walters
oh
danny
what
does
it
mean
dan
went
and
carefully
closed
the
door
of
ella
may
room
before
he
replied
his
face
was
pale
and
his
voice
shaky
mean
well
mother
it
just
means
that
i
been
stealing
walters
trout
all
summer
them
that
what
it
means
oh
danny
but
you
did
know
no
but
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
he
was
the
new
owner
and
have
asked
him
i
never
thought
mother
what
does
according
to
law
mean
i
do
know
i
sure
danny
but
if
this
is
so
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
you
must
go
straight
to
walters
and
tell
him
all
about
it
mother
i
do
dare
to
he
is
a
dreadfully
hard
man
sam
father
says
i
would
believe
a
word
sam
french
father
says
about
mr
walters
said
phillips
firmly
he
got
a
spite
against
him
because
he
was
dismissed
besides
danny
it
the
only
right
thing
to
do
you
know
that
we
poor
but
we
have
never
done
anything
underhand
yet
yes
mother
i
know
said
dan
gulping
his
fear
bravely
down
go
of
course
right
after
dinner
i
was
only
scared
at
first
tell
you
what
i
do
i
clean
these
trout
nicely
and
take
them
to
walters
and
tell
him
that
if
he
only
give
me
time
i
pay
him
back
every
cent
of
money
i
got
for
all
i
sold
this
summer
then
maybe
he
let
me
off
seeing
as
i
did
know
about
the
notice
i
go
with
you
danny
no
i
go
alone
mother
you
need
go
with
me
said
dan
heroically
to
himself
he
said
that
his
mother
had
troubles
enough
he
would
never
subject
her
to
the
added
ordeal
of
an
interview
with
the
stern
factory
owner
he
would
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
himself
if
it
had
to
be
done
do
tell
ella
may
anything
about
it
it
would
worry
her
and
cry
mother
i
guess
it
be
all
right
let
me
have
my
dinner
now
and
i
go
straight
off
dan
ate
his
dinner
rapidly
then
he
carefully
cleaned
his
trout
put
them
in
a
long
basket
with
rhubarb
leaves
over
them
and
started
with
an
assumed
cheerfulness
very
far
from
his
real
feelings
he
had
barely
passed
the
gate
when
another
boy
came
shuffling
along
a
tall
lad
with
an
insinuating
smile
and
shifty
cunning
eyes
the
newcomer
nodded
familiarly
to
dan

give
my
love
to
old
walters
dan
was
not
greatly
encouraged
by
this
interview
he
shrank
more
than
ever
from
the
thought
of
facing
the
stern
factory
owner
his
courage
had
almost
evaporated
when
he
entered
the
office
at
the
factory
and
asked
shakily
for
walters
he
in
his
office
there
replied
the
clerk
but
he
very
busy
better
leave
your
message
with
me
i
must
see
walters
himself
please
said
dan
firmly
but
with
inward
trepidation
the
clerk
swung
himself
impatiently
from
his
stool
and
ushered
dan
into
walters
private
office
boy
to
see
you
sir
he
said
briefly
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
dan
dizzy
and
trembling
stood
in
the
dreaded
presence
walters
was
writing
at
a
table
covered
with
a
businesslike
litter
of
papers
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
up
with
a
frown
as
the
clerk
vanished
he
was
a
man
with
grey
eyes
and
a
square
chin
there
was
not
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
on
his
frame
and
his
voice
and
manner
were
those
of
the
decided
resolute
masterful
man
of
business
he
pointed
to
a
capacious
leather
chair
and
said
concisely
what
is
your
business
with
me
boy
dan
had
carefully
thought
out
a
statement
of
facts
beforehand
but
every
word
had
vanished
from
his
memory
he
had
only
a
confused
desperate
consciousness
that
he
had
a
theft
to
confess
and
that
it
must
be
done
as
soon
as
possible
he
did
not
sit
down
please
walters
he
began
desperately
i
came
to
tell
you
your
notice
i
never
saw
it
before
and
i
been
fishing
on
your
pond
all
summer
but
i
did
know
honest
i
brought
you
all
i
caught
today
and
i
pay
back
for
them
all
some
time
an
amused
puzzled
expression
crossed
walters
noncommittal
face
he
pushed
the
leather
chair
forward
sit
down
my
boy
he
said
kindly
i
do
quite
understand
this
somewhat
statement
of
yours
you
been
fishing
on
my
pond
you
say
did
you
see
my
notice
in
the
dan
sat
down
more
composedly
the
revelation
was
over
and
he
was
still
alive
no
sir
we
hardly
ever
see
an
and
nobody
told
me
always
been
used
to
fishing
there
and
i
never
thought
but
what
it
was
all
right
to
keep
on
i
know
i
ought
to
have
remembered
and
asked
you
but
truly
sir
i
did
mean
to
steal
your
fish
i
used
to
sell
them
over
at
the
hotels
we
saw
the
notice
today
mother
and
me
and
i
came
right
up
i
brought
you
the
trout
i
caught
this
morning
and
if
only
you
wo
prosecute
me
sir
i
pay
back
every
cent
i
got
for
the
others
every
cent
sir
if
you
give
me
time
walters
passed
his
hand
across
his
mouth
to
conceal
something
like
a
smile
your
name
is
dan
phillips
is
it
he
said
irrelevantly
and
you
live
with
your
mother
the
widow
phillips
down
there
at
carleton
corners
i
understand
yes
sir
said
dan
wondering
how
walters
knew
so
much
about
him
and
if
these
were
the
preliminaries
of
prosecution
walters
took
up
his
pen
and
drew
a
blank
sheet
towards
him
well
dan
i
put
that
notice
in
because
i
found
that
many
people
who
used
to
fish
on
my
pond
irrespective
of
leave
or
licence
were
accustomed
to
lunch
or
camp
on
my
property
and
did
not
a
little
damage
i
do
care
for
trouting
myself
i
no
time
for
it
however
i
hardly
think
you
do
much
damage
you
can
keep
on
fishing
there
i
give
you
a
written
permission
so
that
if
any
of
my
men
see
you
they
wo
interfere
with
you
as
for
these
trout
here
i
buy
them
from
you
at
mosquito
lake
prices
and
will
say
no
more
about
the
matter
how
will
that
do
thank
you
sir
stammered
dan
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
he
took
the
slip
of
paper
walters
handed
to
him
and
rose
to
his
feet
wait
a
minute
dan
how
was
it
you
came
to
tell
me
this
you
might
have
stopped
your
depredations
and
i
should
not
have
been
any
the
wiser
that
would
have
been
honest
sir
said
dan
looking
squarely
at
him
there
was
a
brief
silence
walters
thrummed
meditatively
on
the
table
dan
waited
wonderingly
finally
the
factory
owner
said
abruptly
there
a
vacant
place
for
a
boy
down
here
i
want
it
filled
as
soon
as
possible
will
you
take
it
walters
dan
thought
the
world
must
be
turning
upside
down
yes
you
you
are
rather
young
but
the
duties
are
not
hard
or
difficult
to
learn
i
think
you
do
i
was
resolved
not
to
fill
that
place
until
i
could
find
a
perfectly
honest
and
trustworthy
boy
for
it
i
believe
i
have
found
him
i
discharged
the
last
boy
because
he
lied
to
me
about
some
trifling
offence
for
which
i
would
have
forgiven
him
if
he
had
told
the
truth
i
can
bear
with
incompetency
but
falsehood
and
deceit
i
can
not
and
will
not
tolerate
he
said
so
sternly
that
dan
face
paled
i
am
convinced
that
you
are
incapable
of
either
will
you
take
the
place
dan
i
will
if
you
think
i
can
fill
it
sir
i
will
do
my
best
yes
i
believe
you
will
perhaps
i
know
more
about
you
than
you
think
businessmen
must
keep
their
eyes
open
we
regard
this
matter
as
settled
then
come
up
tomorrow
at
eight
and
one
word
more
dan
you
have
perhaps
heard
that
i
am
an
unjust
and
hard
master
i
am
not
the
former
and
you
will
never
have
occasion
to
find
me
the
latter
if
you
are
always
as
truthful
and
straightforward
as
you
have
been
today
you
might
easily
have
deceived
me
in
this
matter
that
you
did
not
do
so
is
the
best
and
only
recommendation
i
require
take
those
trout
up
to
my
house
and
leave
them
that
will
do
good
afternoon
dan
somehow
got
his
dazed
self
through
the
glass
door
and
out
of
the
building
the
whole
interview
had
been
such
a
surprise
to
him
that
he
was
hardly
sure
whether
or
not
he
had
dreamed
it
all
i
feel
as
if
i
were
some
person
else
he
said
to
himself
as
he
started
down
the
hot
white
road
but
mother
was
right
i
stick
to
her
motto
i
wonder
what
sam
will
say
to
this
a
christmas
inspiration
well
i
really
think
santa
claus
has
been
very
good
to
us
all
said
jean
lawrence
pulling
the
pins
out
of
her
heavy
coil
of
fair
hair
and
letting
it
ripple
over
her
shoulders
so
do
i
said
nellie
preston
as
well
as
she
could
with
a
mouthful
of
chocolates
those
blessed
home
folks
of
mine
seem
to
have
divined
by
instinct
the
very
things
i
most
wanted
it
was
the
dusk
of
christmas
eve
and
they
were
all
in
jean
room
at
no
chestnut
terrace
no
was
a
and
are
not
proverbially
cheerful
places
in
which
to
spend
christmas
but
jean
room
at
least
was
a
pleasant
spot
and
all
the
girls
had
brought
their
christmas
presents
in
to
show
each
other
christmas
came
on
sunday
that
year
and
the
saturday
evening
mail
at
chestnut
terrace
had
been
an
exciting
one
jean
had
lighted
the
lamp
on
her
table
and
the
mellow
light
fell
over
merry
faces
as
the
girls
chatted
about
their
gifts
on
the
table
was
a
big
white
box
heaped
with
roses
that
betokened
a
bit
of
christmas
extravagance
on
somebody
part
jean
brother
had
sent
them
to
her
from
montreal
and
all
the
girls
were
enjoying
them
in
common
no
chestnut
terrace
was
overrun
with
girls
generally
but
just
now
only
five
were
left
all
the
others
had
gone
home
for
christmas
but
these
five
could
not
go
and
were
bent
on
making
the
best
of
it
belle
and
olive
reynolds
who
were
sitting
on
the
bed
jean
could
never
keep
them
off
it
were
high
school
girls
they
were
said
to
be
always
laughing
and
even
the
fact
that
they
could
not
go
home
for
christmas
because
a
young
brother
had
measles
did
not
dampen
their
spirits
beth
hamilton
who
was
hovering
over
the
roses
and
nellie
preston
who
was
eating
candy
were
art
students
and
their
homes
were
too
far
away
to
visit
as
for
jean
lawrence
she
was
an
orphan
and
had
no
home
of
her
own
she
worked
on
the
staff
of
one
of
the
big
city
newspapers
and
the
other
girls
were
a
little
in
awe
of
her
cleverness
but
her
nature
was
a
chummy
one
and
her
room
was
a
favourite
rendezvous
everybody
liked
frank
and
hearted
jean
it
was
so
funny
to
see
the
postman
when
he
came
this
evening
said
olive
he
just
bulged
with
parcels
they
were
sticking
out
in
every
direction
we
all
got
our
share
of
them
said
jean
with
a
sigh
of
content
even
the
cook
got
six
i
counted
miss
allen
did
get
a
thing
not
even
a
letter
said
beth
quickly
beth
had
a
trick
of
seeing
things
that
other
girls
did
i
forgot
miss
allen
no
i
do
believe
she
did
answered
jean
thoughtfully
as
she
twisted
up
her
pretty
hair
how
dismal
it
must
be
to
be
so
forlorn
as
that
on
christmas
eve
of
all
times
ugh
i
glad
i
have
friends
i
saw
miss
allen
watching
us
as
we
opened
our
parcels
and
letters
beth
went
on
i
happened
to
look
up
once
and
such
an
expression
as
was
on
her
face
girls
it
was
pathetic
and
sad
and
envious
all
at
once
it
really
made
me
feel
bad
for
five
minutes
she
concluded
honestly
has
miss
allen
any
friends
at
all
asked
beth
no
i
do
think
she
has
answered
jean
she
has
lived
here
for
fourteen
years
so
pickrell
says
think
of
that
girls
fourteen
years
at
chestnut
terrace
is
it
any
wonder
that
she
is
thin
and
and
snappy
nobody
ever
comes
to
see
her
and
she
never
goes
anywhere
said
beth
dear
me
she
must
feel
lonely
now
when
everybody
else
is
being
remembered
by
their
friends
i
ca
forget
her
face
tonight
it
actually
haunts
me
girls
how
would
you
feel
if
you
had
anyone
belonging
to
you
and
if
nobody
thought
about
you
at
christmas
ow
said
olive
as
if
the
mere
idea
made
her
shiver
a
little
silence
followed
to
tell
the
truth
none
of
them
liked
miss
allen
they
knew
that
she
did
not
like
them
either
but
considered
them
frivolous
and
pert
and
complained
when
they
made
a
racket
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
jean
called
her
and
certainly
the
presence
of
the
pale
silent
woman
at
the
no
table
did
not
tend
to
heighten
its
festivity
presently
jean
said
with
a
dramatic
flourish
girls
i
have
an
inspiration
a
christmas
inspiration
what
is
it
cried
four
voices
just
this
let
us
give
miss
allen
a
christmas
surprise
she
has
not
received
a
single
present
and
i
sure
she
feels
lonely
just
think
how
we
would
feel
if
we
were
in
her
place
that
is
true
said
olive
thoughtfully
do
you
know
girls
this
evening
i
went
to
her
room
with
a
message
from
pickrell
and
i
do
believe
she
had
been
crying
her
room
looked
dreadfully
bare
and
cheerless
too
i
think
she
is
very
poor
what
are
we
to
do
jean
let
us
each
give
her
something
nice
we
can
put
the
things
just
outside
of
her
door
so
that
she
will
see
them
whenever
she
opens
it
i
give
her
some
of
fred
roses
too
and
i
write
a
christmassy
letter
in
my
very
best
style
to
go
with
them
said
jean
warming
up
to
her
ideas
as
she
talked
the
other
girls
caught
her
spirit
and
entered
into
the
plan
with
enthusiasm
splendid
cried
beth
jean
it
is
an
inspiration
sure
enough
have
we
been
horribly
selfish
thinking
of
nothing
but
our
own
gifts
and
fun
and
pleasure
i
really
feel
ashamed
let
us
do
the
thing
up
the
very
best
way
we
can
said
nellie
forgetting
even
her
beloved
chocolates
in
her
eagerness
the
shops
are
open
yet
let
us
go
up
town
and
invest
five
minutes
later
five
capped
and
jacketed
figures
were
scurrying
up
the
street
in
the
frosty
starlit
december
dusk
miss
allen
in
her
cold
little
room
heard
their
gay
voices
and
sighed
she
was
crying
by
herself
in
the
dark
it
was
christmas
for
everybody
but
her
she
thought
drearily
in
an
hour
the
girls
came
back
with
their
purchases
now
let
hold
a
council
of
war
said
jean
jubilantly
i
the
faintest
idea
what
miss
allen
would
like
so
i
just
guessed
wildly
i
got
her
a
lace
handkerchief
and
a
big
bottle
of
perfume
and
a
painted
photograph
frame
and
i
stick
my
own
photo
in
it
for
fun
that
was
really
all
i
could
afford
christmas
purchases
have
left
my
purse
dreadfully
lean
i
got
her
a
and
a
pin
tray
said
belle
and
olive
got
her
a
calendar
and
whittier
poems
and
besides
we
are
going
to
give
her
half
of
that
big
plummy
fruit
cake
mother
sent
us
from
home
i
sure
she
has
tasted
anything
so
delicious
for
years
for
fruit
cakes
do
grow
on
chestnut
terrace
and
she
never
goes
anywhere
else
for
a
meal
beth
had
bought
a
pretty
cup
and
saucer
and
said
she
meant
to
give
one
of
her
pretty
too
nellie
true
to
her
reputation
had
invested
in
a
big
box
of
chocolate
creams
a
gorgeously
striped
candy
cane
a
bag
of
oranges
and
a
brilliant
lampshade
of
crepe
paper
to
top
off
with
it
makes
such
a
lot
of
show
for
the
money
she
explained
i
am
bankrupt
like
jean
well
we
got
a
lot
of
pretty
things
said
jean
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
now
we
must
do
them
up
nicely
will
you
wrap
them
in
tissue
paper
girls
and
tie
them
with
baby
ribbon
here
a
box
of
it
while
i
write
that
letter
while
the
others
chatted
over
their
parcels
jean
wrote
her
letter
and
jean
could
write
delightful
letters
she
had
a
decided
talent
in
that
respect
and
her
correspondents
all
declared
her
letters
to
be
things
of
beauty
and
joy
forever
she
put
her
best
into
miss
christmas
letter
since
then
she
has
written
many
bright
and
clever
things
but
i
do
not
believe
she
ever
in
her
life
wrote
anything
more
genuinely
original
and
delightful
than
that
letter
besides
it
breathed
the
very
spirit
of
christmas
and
all
the
girls
declared
that
it
was
splendid
you
must
all
sign
it
now
said
jean
and
i
put
it
in
one
of
those
big
envelopes
and
nellie
wo
you
write
her
name
on
it
in
fancy
letters
which
nellie
proceeded
to
do
and
furthermore
embellished
the
envelope
by
a
border
of
chubby
cherubs
dancing
hand
in
hand
around
it
and
a
sketch
of
no
chestnut
terrace
in
the
corner
in
lieu
of
a
stamp
not
content
with
this
she
hunted
out
a
huge
sheet
of
drawing
paper
and
drew
upon
it
an
original
design
after
her
own
heart
a
dudish
cat
miss
allen
was
fond
of
the
no
cat
if
she
could
be
said
to
be
fond
of
anything
was
portrayed
seated
on
a
rocker
arrayed
in
smoking
jacket
and
cap
with
a
cigar
waved
airily
aloft
in
one
paw
while
the
other
held
out
a
placard
bearing
the
legend
merry
christmas
a
second
cat
in
full
street
costume
bowed
politely
hat
in
paw
and
waved
a
banner
inscribed
with
happy
new
year
while
faintly
suggested
kittens
gambolled
around
the
border
the
girls
laughed
until
they
cried
over
it
and
voted
it
to
be
the
best
thing
nellie
had
yet
done
in
original
work
all
this
had
taken
time
and
it
was
past
eleven
miss
allen
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
long
ago
and
everybody
else
in
chestnut
terrace
was
abed
when
five
figures
cautiously
crept
down
the
hall
headed
by
jean
with
a
dim
lamp
outside
of
miss
allen
door
the
procession
halted
and
the
girls
silently
arranged
their
gifts
on
the
floor
that
done
whispered
jean
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
as
they
tiptoed
back
and
now
let
us
go
to
bed
or
pickrell
bless
her
heart
will
be
down
on
us
for
burning
so
much
midnight
oil
oil
has
gone
up
you
know
girls
it
was
in
the
early
morning
that
miss
allen
opened
her
door
but
early
as
it
was
another
door
down
the
hall
was
half
open
too
and
five
rosy
faces
were
peering
cautiously
out
the
girls
had
been
up
for
an
hour
for
fear
they
would
miss
the
sight
and
were
all
in
nellie
room
which
commanded
a
view
of
miss
allen
door
that
lady
face
was
a
study
amazement
incredulity
wonder
chased
each
other
over
it
succeeded
by
a
glow
of
pleasure
on
the
floor
before
her
was
a
snug
little
pyramid
of
parcels
topped
by
letter
on
a
chair
behind
it
was
a
bowl
of
delicious
roses
and
nellie
placard
miss
allen
looked
down
the
hall
but
saw
nothing
for
jean
had
slammed
the
door
just
in
time
half
an
hour
later
when
they
were
going
down
to
breakfast
miss
allen
came
along
the
hall
with
outstretched
hands
to
meet
them
she
had
been
crying
again
but
i
think
her
tears
were
happy
ones
and
she
was
smiling
now
a
cluster
of
jean
roses
were
pinned
on
her
breast
oh
girls
girls
she
said
with
a
little
tremble
in
her
voice
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
it
was
so
kind
and
sweet
of
you
you
know
how
much
good
you
have
done
me
breakfast
was
an
unusually
cheerful
affair
at
no
that
morning
there
was
no
skeleton
at
the
feast
and
everybody
was
beaming
miss
allen
laughed
and
talked
like
a
girl
herself
oh
how
surprised
i
was
she
said
the
roses
were
like
a
bit
of
summer
and
those
cats
of
nellie
were
so
funny
and
delightful
and
your
letter
too
jean
i
cried
and
laughed
over
it
i
shall
read
it
every
day
for
a
year
after
breakfast
everyone
went
to
christmas
service
the
girls
went
uptown
to
the
church
they
attended
the
city
was
very
beautiful
in
the
morning
sunshine
there
had
been
a
white
frost
in
the
night
and
the
avenues
and
public
squares
seemed
like
glimpses
of
fairyland
how
lovely
the
world
is
said
jean
this
is
really
the
very
happiest
christmas
morning
i
have
ever
known
declared
nellie
i
never
felt
so
really
christmassy
in
my
inmost
soul
before
i
suppose
said
beth
thoughtfully
that
it
is
because
we
have
discovered
for
ourselves
the
old
truth
that
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
i
always
known
it
in
a
way
but
i
never
realized
it
before
blessing
on
jean
christmas
inspiration
said
nellie
but
girls
let
us
try
to
make
it
an
inspiration
i
say
we
can
bring
a
little
of
our
own
sunshine
into
miss
allen
life
as
long
as
we
live
with
her
amen
to
that
said
jean
heartily
oh
listen
girls
the
christmas
chimes
and
over
all
the
beautiful
city
was
wafted
the
grand
old
message
of
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
all
the
world
a
christmas
mistake
tomorrow
is
christmas
announced
teddy
grant
exultantly
as
he
sat
on
the
floor
struggling
manfully
with
a
refractory
bootlace
that
was
knotted
and
tagless
and
stubbornly
refused
to
go
into
the
eyelets
of
teddy
patched
boots
ai
i
glad
though
hurrah
his
mother
was
washing
the
breakfast
dishes
in
a
dreary
listless
sort
of
way
she
looked
tired
and
ted
enthusiasm
seemed
to
grate
on
her
for
she
answered
sharply
christmas
indeed
i
ca
see
that
it
is
anything
for
us
to
rejoice
over
other
people
may
be
glad
enough
but
what
with
winter
coming
on
i
sooner
it
was
spring
than
christmas
mary
alice
do
lift
that
child
out
of
the
ashes
and
put
its
shoes
and
stockings
on
everything
seems
to
be
at
sixes
and
sevens
here
this
morning
keith
the
oldest
boy
was
coiled
up
on
the
sofa
calmly
working
out
some
algebra
problems
quite
oblivious
to
the
noise
around
him
but
he
looked
up
from
his
slate
with
his
pencil
suspended
above
an
obstinate
equation
to
declaim
with
a
flourish
christmas
comes
but
once
a
year
and
then
mother
wishes
it
was
here
i
do
then
said
gordon
son
number
two
who
was
preparing
his
own
noon
lunch
of
bread
and
molasses
at
the
table
and
making
an
atrocious
mess
of
crumbs
and
sugary
syrup
over
everything
i
know
one
thing
to
be
thankful
for
and
that
is
that
there
be
no
school
we
have
a
whole
week
of
holidays
gordon
was
noted
for
his
aversion
to
school
and
his
affection
for
holidays
and
we
going
to
have
turkey
for
dinner
declared
teddy
getting
up
off
the
floor
and
rushing
to
secure
his
share
of
bread
and
molasses
and
sauce
and
and
pound
cake
ai
we
ma
no
you
are
not
said
grant
desperately
dropping
the
dishcloth
and
snatching
the
baby
on
her
knee
to
wipe
the
crust
of
cinders
and
molasses
from
the
chubby
face
you
may
as
well
know
it
now
children
i
kept
it
from
you
so
far
in
hopes
that
something
would
turn
up
but
nothing
has
we
ca
have
any
christmas
dinner
tomorrow
we
ca
afford
it
i
pinched
and
saved
every
way
i
could
for
the
last
month
hoping
that
i
be
able
to
get
a
turkey
for
you
anyhow
but
you
have
to
do
without
it
there
that
doctor
bill
to
pay
and
a
dozen
other
bills
coming
in
and
people
say
they
wait
i
suppose
they
ca
but
it
kind
of
hard
i
must
say
the
little
grants
stood
with
open
mouths
and
horrified
eyes
no
turkey
for
christmas
was
the
world
coming
to
an
end
would
the
government
interfere
if
anyone
ventured
to
dispense
with
a
christmas
celebration
the
gluttonous
teddy
stuffed
his
fists
into
his
eyes
and
lifted
up
his
voice
keith
who
understood
better
than
the
others
the
look
on
his
mother
face
took
his
blubbering
young
brother
by
the
collar
and
marched
him
into
the
porch
the
twins
seeing
the
summary
proceeding
swallowed
the
outcries
they
had
intended
to
make
although
they
could
keep
a
few
big
tears
from
running
down
their
fat
cheeks
grant
looked
pityingly
at
the
disappointed
faces
about
her
do
cry
children
you
make
me
feel
worse
we
are
not
the
only
ones
who
will
have
to
do
without
a
christmas
turkey
we
ought
to
be
very
thankful
that
we
have
anything
to
eat
at
all
i
hate
to
disappoint
you
but
it
ca
be
helped
never
mind
mother
said
keith
comfortingly
relaxing
his
hold
upon
the
porch
door
whereupon
it
suddenly
flew
open
and
precipitated
teddy
who
had
been
tugging
at
the
handle
heels
over
head
backwards
we
know
you
done
your
best
it
been
a
hard
year
for
you
just
wait
though
i
soon
be
grown
up
and
then
you
and
these
greedy
youngsters
shall
feast
on
turkey
every
day
of
the
year
hello
teddy
have
you
got
on
your
feet
again
mind
sir
no
more
blubbering
when
i
a
man
announced
teddy
with
dignity
i
just
like
to
see
you
put
me
in
the
porch
and
i
mean
to
have
turkey
all
the
time
and
i
wo
give
you
any
either
all
right
you
greedy
small
boy
only
take
yourself
off
to
school
now
and
let
us
hear
no
more
squeaks
out
of
you
tramp
all
of
you
and
give
mother
a
chance
to
get
her
work
done
grant
got
up
and
fell
to
work
at
her
dishes
with
a
brighter
face
well
we
must
give
in
perhaps
things
will
be
better
after
a
while
i
make
a
famous
bread
pudding
and
you
can
boil
some
molasses
taffy
and
ask
those
little
smithsons
next
door
to
help
you
pull
it
they
wo
whine
for
turkey
i
be
bound
i
do
suppose
they
ever
tasted
such
a
thing
in
all
their
lives
if
i
could
afford
it
i
have
had
them
all
in
to
dinner
with
us
that
sermon
evans
preached
last
sunday
kind
of
stirred
me
up
he
said
we
ought
always
to
try
and
share
our
christmas
joy
with
some
poor
souls
who
had
never
learned
the
meaning
of
the
word
i
ca
do
as
much
as
i
like
to
it
was
different
when
your
father
was
alive
the
noisy
group
grew
silent
as
they
always
did
when
their
father
was
spoken
of
he
had
died
the
year
before
and
since
his
death
the
little
family
had
had
a
hard
time
keith
to
hide
his
feelings
began
to
hector
the
rest
mary
alice
do
hurry
up
here
you
twin
nuisances
get
off
to
school
if
you
do
you
be
late
and
then
the
master
will
give
you
a
whipping
he
wo
answered
the
irrepressible
teddy
he
never
whips
us
he
does
he
stands
us
on
the
floor
sometimes
though
he
added
remembering
the
many
times
his
own
chubby
legs
had
been
seen
to
better
advantage
on
the
school
platform
that
man
said
grant
alluding
to
the
teacher
makes
me
nervous
he
is
the
most
abstracted
creature
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
he
does
walk
straight
into
the
river
some
day
you
meet
him
meandering
along
the
street
gazing
into
vacancy
and
he
never
see
you
nor
hear
a
word
you
say
half
the
time
yesterday
said
gordon
chuckling
over
the
remembrance
he
came
in
with
a
big
piece
of
paper
he
picked
up
on
the
entry
floor
in
one
hand
and
his
hat
in
the
other
and
he
stuffed
his
hat
into
the
and
hung
up
the
paper
on
a
nail
as
grave
as
you
please
never
knew
the
difference
till
ned
slocum
went
and
told
him
always
doing
things
like
that
keith
had
collected
his
books
and
now
marched
his
brothers
and
sisters
off
to
school
left
alone
with
the
baby
grant
betook
herself
to
her
work
with
a
heavy
heart
but
a
second
interruption
broke
the
progress
of
her
i
declare
she
said
with
a
surprised
glance
through
the
window
if
there
is
that
schoolteacher
coming
through
the
yard
what
can
he
want
dear
me
i
do
hope
teddy
has
been
cutting
capers
in
school
again
for
the
teacher
last
call
had
been
in
october
and
had
been
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
the
irrepressible
teddy
would
persist
in
going
to
school
with
his
pockets
filled
with
live
crickets
and
in
driving
them
harnessed
to
strings
up
and
down
the
aisle
when
the
teacher
back
was
turned
all
mild
methods
of
punishment
having
failed
the
teacher
had
called
to
talk
it
over
with
grant
with
the
happy
result
that
teddy
behaviour
had
improved
in
the
matter
of
crickets
at
least
but
it
was
about
time
for
another
outbreak
teddy
had
been
unnaturally
good
for
too
long
a
time
poor
grant
feared
that
it
was
the
calm
before
a
storm
and
it
was
with
nervous
haste
that
she
went
to
the
door
and
greeted
the
young
teacher
he
was
a
slight
pale
fellow
with
an
abstracted
musing
look
in
his
large
dark
eyes
grant
noticed
with
amusement
that
he
wore
a
white
straw
hat
in
spite
of
the
season
his
eyes
were
directed
to
her
face
with
his
usual
unseeing
gaze
just
as
though
he
was
looking
through
me
at
something
a
thousand
miles
away
said
grant
afterwards
i
believe
he
was
too
his
body
was
right
there
on
the
step
before
me
but
where
his
soul
was
is
more
than
you
or
i
or
anybody
can
tell
good
morning
he
said
absently
i
have
just
called
on
my
way
to
school
with
a
message
from
miss
millar
she
wants
you
all
to
come
up
and
have
christmas
dinner
with
her
tomorrow
for
the
land
sake
said
grant
blankly
i
do
understand
to
herself
she
thought
i
wish
i
dared
take
him
and
shake
him
to
find
if
he
walking
in
his
sleep
or
not
you
and
all
the
children
every
one
went
on
the
teacher
dreamily
as
if
he
were
reciting
a
lesson
learned
beforehand
she
told
me
to
tell
you
to
be
sure
and
come
shall
i
say
that
you
will
oh
yes
that
is
i
suppose
i
do
know
said
grant
incoherently
i
never
expected
yes
you
may
tell
her
we
come
she
concluded
abruptly
thank
you
said
the
abstracted
messenger
gravely
lifting
his
hat
and
looking
squarely
through
grant
into
unknown
regions
when
he
had
gone
grant
went
in
and
sat
down
laughing
in
a
sort
of
hysterical
way
i
wonder
if
it
is
all
right
could
cornelia
really
have
told
him
she
must
i
suppose
but
it
is
enough
to
take
one
breath
grant
and
cornelia
millar
were
cousins
and
had
once
been
the
closest
of
friends
but
that
was
years
ago
before
some
spiteful
reports
and
gossip
had
come
between
them
making
only
a
little
rift
at
first
that
soon
widened
into
a
chasm
of
coldness
and
alienation
therefore
this
invitation
surprised
grant
greatly
miss
cornelia
was
a
maiden
lady
of
certain
years
with
a
comfortable
bank
account
and
a
handsome
house
on
the
hill
behind
the
village
she
always
boarded
the
schoolteachers
and
looked
after
them
maternally
she
was
an
active
church
worker
and
a
tower
of
strength
to
struggling
ministers
and
their
families
if
cornelia
has
seen
fit
at
last
to
hold
out
the
hand
of
reconciliation
i
glad
enough
to
take
it
dear
knows
i
wanted
to
make
up
often
enough
but
i
did
think
she
ever
would
we
both
of
us
got
too
much
pride
and
stubbornness
it
the
turner
blood
in
us
that
does
it
the
turners
were
all
so
set
but
i
mean
to
do
my
part
now
she
has
done
hers
and
grant
made
a
final
attack
on
the
dishes
with
a
beaming
face
when
the
little
grants
came
home
and
heard
the
news
teddy
stood
on
his
head
to
express
his
delight
the
twins
kissed
each
other
and
mary
alice
and
gordon
danced
around
the
kitchen
keith
thought
himself
too
big
to
betray
any
joy
over
a
christmas
dinner
but
he
whistled
while
doing
the
chores
until
the
bare
welkin
in
the
yard
rang
and
teddy
in
spite
of
unheard
of
misdemeanours
was
not
collared
off
into
the
porch
once
when
the
young
teacher
got
home
from
school
that
evening
he
found
the
yellow
house
full
of
all
sorts
of
delectable
odours
miss
cornelia
herself
was
concocting
mince
pies
after
the
famous
family
recipe
while
her
ancient
and
faithful
handmaiden
hannah
was
straining
into
moulds
the
cranberry
jelly
the
open
pantry
door
revealed
a
tempting
array
of
christmas
delicacies
did
you
call
and
invite
the
smithsons
up
to
dinner
as
i
told
you
asked
miss
cornelia
anxiously
yes
was
the
dreamy
response
as
he
glided
through
the
kitchen
and
vanished
into
the
hall
miss
cornelia
crimped
the
edges
of
her
pies
delicately
with
a
relieved
air
i
made
certain
he
forget
it
she
said
you
just
have
to
watch
him
as
if
he
were
a
mere
child
did
i
catch
him
yesterday
starting
off
to
school
in
his
carpet
slippers
and
in
spite
of
me
he
got
away
today
in
that
ridiculous
summer
hat
you
better
set
that
jelly
in
the
to
cool
hannah
it
looks
good
we
give
those
poor
little
smithsons
a
feast
for
once
in
their
lives
if
they
never
get
another
at
this
juncture
the
hall
door
flew
open
and
palmer
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
seemed
considerably
agitated
and
for
once
his
eyes
had
lost
their
look
of
miss
millar
i
am
afraid
i
did
make
a
mistake
this
morning
it
has
just
dawned
on
me
i
am
almost
sure
that
i
called
at
grant
and
invited
her
and
her
family
instead
of
the
smithsons
and
she
said
they
would
come
miss
cornelia
face
was
a
study
palmer
she
said
flourishing
her
crimping
fork
tragically
do
you
mean
to
say
you
went
and
invited
linda
grant
here
tomorrow
linda
grant
of
all
women
in
this
world
i
did
said
the
teacher
with
penitent
wretchedness
it
was
very
careless
of
me
i
am
very
sorry
what
can
i
do
i
go
down
and
tell
them
i
made
a
mistake
if
you
like
you
ca
do
that
groaned
miss
cornelia
sitting
down
and
wrinkling
up
her
forehead
in
dire
perplexity
it
would
never
do
in
the
world
for
pity
sake
let
me
think
for
a
minute
miss
cornelia
did
think
to
good
purpose
evidently
for
her
forehead
smoothed
out
as
her
meditations
proceeded
and
her
face
brightened
then
she
got
up
briskly
well
you
done
it
and
no
mistake
i
know
that
i
sorry
either
anyhow
we
leave
it
as
it
is
but
you
must
go
straight
down
now
and
invite
the
smithsons
too
and
for
sake
do
make
any
more
mistakes
when
he
had
gone
miss
cornelia
opened
her
heart
to
hannah
i
never
could
have
done
it
myself
never
the
turner
is
too
strong
in
me
but
i
glad
it
is
done
i
been
wanting
for
years
to
make
up
with
linda
and
now
the
chance
has
come
thanks
to
that
blessed
blundering
boy
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
it
mind
hannah
you
never
whisper
a
word
about
its
being
a
mistake
linda
must
never
know
poor
linda
she
had
a
hard
time
hannah
we
must
make
some
more
pies
and
i
must
go
straight
down
to
the
store
and
get
some
more
santa
claus
stuff
i
only
got
enough
to
go
around
the
smithsons
when
grant
and
her
family
arrived
at
the
yellow
house
next
morning
miss
cornelia
herself
ran
out
bareheaded
to
meet
them
the
two
women
shook
hands
a
little
stiffly
and
then
a
rill
of
affection
trickled
out
from
some
secret
spring
in
miss
heart
and
she
kissed
her
old
friend
tenderly
linda
returned
the
kiss
warmly
and
both
felt
that
the
friendship
was
theirs
again
the
little
smithsons
all
came
and
they
and
the
little
grants
sat
down
on
the
long
bright
dining
room
to
a
dinner
that
made
history
in
their
small
lives
and
was
eaten
over
again
in
happy
dreams
for
months
how
those
children
did
eat
and
how
beaming
miss
cornelia
and
hannah
and
even
the
teacher
himself
enjoyed
watching
them
after
dinner
miss
cornelia
distributed
among
the
delighted
little
souls
the
presents
she
had
bought
for
them
and
then
turned
them
loose
in
the
big
shining
kitchen
to
have
a
taffy
pull
and
they
had
it
to
their
hearts
content
and
as
for
the
shocking
taffyfied
state
into
which
they
got
their
own
rosy
faces
and
that
once
immaculate
domain
well
as
miss
cornelia
and
hannah
never
said
one
word
about
it
neither
will
i
the
four
women
enjoyed
the
afternoon
in
their
own
way
and
the
schoolteacher
buried
himself
in
algebra
to
his
own
great
satisfaction
when
her
guests
went
home
in
the
starlit
december
dusk
miss
cornelia
walked
part
of
the
way
with
them
and
had
a
long
confidential
talk
with
grant
when
she
returned
it
was
to
find
hannah
groaning
in
and
over
the
kitchen
and
the
schoolteacher
dreamily
trying
to
clean
some
molasses
off
his
boots
with
the
kitchen
hairbrush
miss
cornelia
rescued
her
property
and
despatched
palmer
into
the
woodshed
to
find
the
then
she
sat
down
and
laughed
hannah
what
will
become
of
that
boy
yet
there
no
counting
on
what
he
do
next
i
do
know
how
he
ever
get
through
the
world
sure
but
i
look
after
him
while
he
here
at
least
i
owe
him
a
huge
debt
of
gratitude
for
this
christmas
blunder
what
an
awful
mess
this
place
is
in
but
hannah
did
you
ever
in
the
world
see
anything
so
delightful
as
that
little
tommy
smithson
stuffing
himself
with
plum
cake
not
to
mention
teddy
grant
it
did
me
good
just
to
see
them
a
strayed
allegiance
will
you
go
to
the
cove
with
me
this
afternoon
it
was
marian
lesley
who
asked
the
question
esterbrook
elliott
unpinned
with
a
masterful
touch
the
delicate
cluster
of
noisette
rosebuds
she
wore
at
her
throat
and
transferred
them
to
his
buttonhole
as
he
answered
courteously
certainly
my
time
as
you
know
is
entirely
at
your
disposal
they
were
standing
in
the
garden
under
the
creamy
bloom
of
drooping
acacia
trees
one
long
plume
of
blossoms
touched
lightly
the
soft
coils
of
the
girl
hair
and
cast
a
wavering
shadow
over
the
beautiful
face
beneath
it
esterbrook
elliott
standing
before
her
thought
proudly
that
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
who
might
compare
with
her
in
every
detail
she
satisfied
his
critical
fastidious
taste
there
was
not
a
discordant
touch
about
her
esterbrook
elliott
had
always
loved
marian
lesley
or
thought
he
had
they
had
grown
up
together
from
childhood
he
was
an
only
son
and
she
an
only
daughter
it
had
always
been
an
understood
thing
between
the
two
families
that
the
boy
and
girl
should
marry
but
marian
father
had
decreed
that
no
positive
pledge
should
pass
between
them
until
marian
was
esterbrook
accepted
his
destiny
and
selected
bride
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
an
exceptionally
lucky
fellow
out
of
all
the
women
in
the
world
marian
was
the
very
one
whom
he
would
have
chosen
as
mistress
of
his
fine
old
home
she
had
been
his
boyhood
ideal
he
believed
that
he
loved
her
sincerely
but
he
was
not
too
much
in
love
to
be
blind
to
the
worldly
advantages
of
his
marriage
with
his
cousin
his
father
had
died
two
years
previously
leaving
him
wealthy
and
independent
marian
had
lost
her
mother
in
childhood
her
father
died
when
she
was
eighteen
since
then
she
had
lived
alone
with
her
aunt
her
life
was
quiet
and
lonely
esterbrook
companionship
was
all
that
brightened
it
but
it
was
enough
marian
lavished
on
him
all
the
rich
womanly
love
of
her
heart
on
her
birthday
they
were
formally
betrothed
they
were
to
be
married
in
the
following
autumn
no
shadow
had
drifted
across
the
heaven
of
her
happiness
she
believed
herself
secure
in
her
lover
unfaltering
devotion
true
at
times
she
thought
his
manner
lacked
a
lover
passionate
ardour
he
was
always
attentive
and
courteous
she
had
only
to
utter
a
wish
to
find
that
it
had
been
anticipated
he
spent
every
spare
minute
at
her
side
yet
sometimes
she
half
wished
he
would
betray
more
impatience
and
intensity
were
all
lovers
as
calm
and
undemonstrative
she
reproached
herself
for
this
incipient
disloyalty
as
often
as
it
vexingly
intruded
its
unwelcome
presence
across
her
inner
consciousness
surely
esterbrook
was
fond
and
devoted
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
exacting
demands
of
affection
marian
herself
was
somewhat
undemonstrative
and
reserved
passing
acquaintances
called
her
cold
and
proud
only
the
privileged
few
knew
the
rich
depths
of
womanly
tenderness
in
her
nature
esterbrook
thought
that
he
fully
appreciated
her
as
he
had
walked
homeward
the
night
of
their
betrothal
he
had
reviewed
with
unconscious
criticism
his
mental
catalogue
of
marian
graces
and
good
qualities
admitting
with
supreme
satisfaction
that
there
was
not
one
thing
about
her
that
he
could
wish
changed
this
afternoon
under
the
acacias
they
had
been
planning
about
their
wedding
there
was
no
one
to
consult
but
themselves
they
were
to
be
married
early
in
september
and
then
go
abroad
esterbrook
mapped
out
the
details
of
their
bridal
tour
with
careful
thoughtfulness
they
would
visit
all
the
places
that
marian
wished
to
see
afterwards
they
would
come
back
home
he
discussed
certain
changes
he
wished
to
make
in
the
old
elliott
mansion
to
fit
it
for
a
young
and
beautiful
mistress
he
did
most
of
the
planning
marian
was
content
to
listen
in
happy
silence
afterwards
she
had
proposed
this
walk
to
the
cove
what
particular
object
of
charity
have
you
found
at
the
cove
now
asked
esterbrook
with
lazy
interest
as
they
walked
along
barrett
little
bessie
is
very
ill
with
fever
answered
marian
then
catching
his
anxious
look
she
hastened
to
add
it
is
nothing
infectious
some
kind
of
a
slow
sapping
variety
there
is
no
danger
esterbrook
i
was
not
afraid
for
myself
he
replied
quietly
my
alarm
was
for
you
you
are
too
precious
to
me
marian
for
me
to
permit
you
to
risk
health
and
life
if
it
were
dangerous
what
a
lady
bountiful
you
are
to
those
people
at
the
cove
when
we
are
married
you
must
take
me
in
hand
and
teach
me
your
creed
of
charity
i
afraid
i
lived
a
rather
selfish
life
you
will
change
all
that
dear
you
will
make
a
good
man
of
me
you
are
that
now
esterbrook
she
said
softly
if
you
were
not
i
could
not
love
you
it
is
a
negative
sort
of
goodness
i
fear
i
have
never
been
tried
or
tempted
severely
perhaps
i
should
fail
under
the
test
i
am
sure
you
would
not
answered
marian
proudly
esterbrook
laughed
her
faith
in
him
was
pleasant
he
had
no
thought
but
that
he
would
prove
worthy
of
it
the
cove
was
a
little
fishing
hamlet
situated
on
the
low
sandy
shore
of
a
small
bay
the
houses
clustered
in
one
spot
seemed
like
nothing
so
much
as
larger
shells
washed
up
by
the
sea
so
grey
and
bleached
were
they
from
long
exposure
to
sea
winds
and
spray
dozens
of
ragged
children
were
playing
about
them
mingled
with
several
disreputable
yellow
curs
that
yapped
noisily
at
the
strangers
down
on
the
sandy
strip
of
beach
below
the
houses
groups
of
men
were
lounging
about
the
mackerel
season
had
not
yet
set
in
the
spring
herring
netting
was
past
it
was
holiday
time
among
the
sea
folks
they
were
enjoying
it
to
the
full
a
happy
ragged
colony
careless
of
what
the
morrows
might
bring
forth
out
beyond
the
boats
were
at
anchor
floating
as
gracefully
on
the
twinkling
water
as
sea
birds
their
tall
masts
bowing
landward
on
the
swell
a
lazy
dreamful
calm
had
fallen
over
the
distant
seas
the
horizon
blues
were
pale
and
dim
faint
purple
hazes
blurred
the
outlines
of
headlands
and
cliffs
the
yellow
sands
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
as
if
powdered
with
jewels
a
murmurous
babble
of
life
buzzed
about
the
hamlet
pierced
through
by
the
shrill
undertones
of
the
wrangling
children
most
of
whom
had
paused
in
their
play
to
scan
the
visitors
with
covert
curiosity
marian
led
the
way
to
a
house
apart
from
the
others
at
the
very
edge
of
the
shelving
rock
the
dooryard
was
scrupulously
clean
and
unlittered
the
little
footpath
through
it
was
neatly
bordered
by
white
clam
shells
several
thrifty
geraniums
in
bloom
looked
out
from
the
windows
a
woman
came
forward
to
meet
them
bessie
much
the
same
miss
lesley
she
said
in
answer
to
inquiry
the
doctor
you
sent
was
here
today
and
did
all
he
could
for
her
he
seemed
quite
hopeful
she
do
complain
or
nothing
just
lies
there
and
moans
sometimes
she
gets
restless
it
very
kind
of
you
to
come
so
often
miss
lesley
here
magdalen
will
you
put
this
basket
the
lady
brought
up
there
on
the
shelf
a
girl
who
had
been
sitting
unnoticed
with
her
back
to
the
visitors
at
the
head
of
the
child
cot
in
one
corner
of
the
room
stood
up
and
slowly
turned
around
marian
and
esterbrook
elliott
both
started
with
involuntary
surprise
esterbrook
caught
his
breath
like
a
man
suddenly
awakened
from
sleep
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
wonderful
who
or
what
could
this
girl
be
so
little
in
harmony
with
her
surroundings
standing
in
the
crepuscular
light
of
the
corner
her
marvellous
beauty
shone
out
with
the
vivid
richness
of
some
rare
painting
she
was
tall
and
the
magnificent
proportions
of
her
figure
were
enhanced
rather
than
marred
by
the
severely
plain
dress
of
dark
print
that
she
wore
the
heavy
masses
of
her
hair
a
shining
auburn
dashed
with
golden
foam
were
coiled
in
a
rich
glossy
knot
at
the
back
of
the
classically
modelled
head
and
rippled
back
from
a
low
brow
whose
waxen
fairness
even
the
breezes
of
the
ocean
had
spared
the
girl
face
was
a
full
perfect
oval
with
features
of
faultless
regularity
and
the
large
full
eyes
were
of
tawny
hazel
darkened
into
inscrutable
gloom
in
the
dimness
of
the
corner
not
even
marian
lesley
face
was
more
delicately
tinted
but
not
a
trace
of
colour
appeared
in
the
smooth
cheeks
yet
the
waxen
pallor
bore
no
trace
of
disease
or
weakness
and
the
large
curving
mouth
was
of
an
intense
crimson
she
stood
quite
motionless
there
was
no
trace
of
embarrassment
or
in
her
pose
when
barrett
said
this
is
my
niece
magdalen
crawford
she
merely
inclined
her
head
in
grave
silent
acknowledgement
as
she
moved
forward
to
take
marian
basket
she
seemed
oddly
out
of
place
in
the
low
crowded
room
her
presence
seemed
to
throw
a
strange
restraint
over
the
group
marian
rose
and
went
over
to
the
cot
laying
her
slender
hand
on
the
hot
forehead
of
the
little
sufferer
the
child
opened
its
brown
eyes
questioningly
how
are
you
today
bessie
i
want
moaned
the
little
plaintive
voice
magdalen
came
over
and
stood
beside
marian
lesley
she
wants
me
she
said
in
a
low
thrilling
voice
free
from
all
harsh
accent
or
intonation
i
am
the
only
one
she
seems
to
know
always
yes
darling
is
here
right
beside
you
she
will
not
leave
you
she
knelt
by
the
little
cot
and
passed
her
arm
under
the
child
neck
drawing
the
curly
head
close
to
her
throat
with
a
tender
soothing
motion
esterbrook
elliott
watched
the
two
women
intently
the
one
standing
by
the
cot
arrayed
in
simple
yet
costly
apparel
with
her
beautiful
face
and
the
other
kneeling
on
the
bare
sanded
floor
in
her
print
dress
with
her
splendid
head
bent
low
over
the
child
and
the
long
fringe
of
burnished
lashes
sweeping
the
cold
pallor
of
the
oval
cheek
from
the
moment
that
magdalen
crawford
haunting
eyes
had
looked
straight
into
his
for
one
fleeting
second
an
unnamable
thrill
of
pain
and
pleasure
stirred
his
heart
a
thrill
so
strong
and
sudden
and
passionate
that
his
face
paled
with
emotion
the
room
seemed
to
swim
before
his
eyes
in
a
mist
out
of
which
gleamed
that
wonderful
face
with
its
mesmeric
darkly
radiant
eyes
burning
their
way
into
deeps
and
abysses
of
his
soul
hitherto
unknown
to
him
when
the
mist
cleared
away
and
his
head
grew
steadier
he
wondered
at
himself
yet
he
trembled
in
every
limb
and
the
only
clear
idea
that
struggled
out
of
his
confused
thoughts
was
an
overmastering
desire
to
take
that
cold
face
between
his
hands
and
kiss
it
until
its
passionless
marble
glowed
into
warm
and
throbbing
life
who
is
that
girl
he
said
abruptly
when
they
had
left
the
cottage
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
have
ever
seen
present
company
always
excepted
he
concluded
with
a
depreciatory
laugh
the
delicate
bloom
on
marian
face
deepened
slightly
you
had
much
better
to
have
omitted
that
last
sentence
she
said
quietly
it
was
so
palpably
an
afterthought
yes
she
is
wonderfully
lovely
a
strange
beauty
i
fancied
there
seemed
something
odd
and
uncanny
about
it
to
me
she
must
be
barrett
niece
i
remember
that
when
i
was
down
here
about
a
month
ago
barrett
told
me
she
expected
a
niece
of
hers
to
live
with
her
for
a
time
at
least
her
parents
were
both
dead
the
father
having
died
recently
barrett
seemed
troubled
about
her
she
said
that
the
girl
had
been
well
brought
up
and
used
to
better
things
than
the
cove
could
give
her
and
she
feared
that
she
would
be
very
discontented
and
unhappy
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
until
i
saw
the
girl
today
she
certainly
seems
to
be
a
very
superior
person
she
will
find
the
cove
very
lonely
i
am
sure
it
is
not
probable
she
will
stay
there
long
i
must
see
what
i
can
do
for
her
but
her
manner
seemed
rather
repellent
do
you
think
hardly
responded
esterbrook
curtly
she
seemed
surprisingly
dignified
and
i
fancied
for
a
girl
in
her
position
a
princess
could
not
have
looked
and
bowed
more
royally
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
embarrassment
in
her
manner
in
spite
of
the
incongruity
of
her
surroundings
you
had
much
better
leave
her
alone
marian
in
all
probability
she
would
resent
any
condescension
on
your
part
what
wonderful
deep
lovely
eyes
she
has
again
the
sensitive
colour
flushed
marian
cheek
as
his
voice
lapsed
unconsciously
into
a
dreamy
retrospective
tone
and
a
slight
restraint
came
over
her
manner
which
did
not
depart
esterbrook
went
away
at
sunset
marian
asked
him
to
remain
for
the
evening
but
he
pleaded
some
excuse
i
shall
come
tomorrow
afternoon
he
said
as
he
stooped
to
drop
a
careless
kiss
on
her
face
marian
watched
him
wistfully
as
he
rode
away
with
an
unaccountable
pain
in
her
heart
she
felt
more
acutely
than
ever
that
there
were
depths
in
her
lover
nature
that
she
was
powerless
to
stir
into
responsive
life
had
any
other
that
power
she
thought
of
the
girl
at
the
cove
with
her
deep
eyes
and
wonderful
face
a
chill
of
premonitory
fear
seized
upon
her
i
feel
exactly
as
if
esterbrook
had
gone
away
from
me
forever
she
said
slowly
to
herself
stooping
to
brush
her
cheek
against
a
acacia
bloom
and
would
never
come
back
to
me
again
if
that
could
happen
i
wonder
what
there
would
be
left
to
live
for
esterbrook
elliott
meant
or
honestly
thought
he
meant
to
go
home
when
he
left
marian
nevertheless
when
he
reached
the
road
branching
off
to
the
cove
he
turned
his
horse
down
it
with
a
flush
on
his
dark
cheek
he
realized
that
the
motive
of
the
action
was
disloyal
to
marian
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
weakness
but
the
desire
to
see
magdalen
crawford
once
more
and
to
look
into
the
depths
of
her
eyes
was
stronger
than
all
else
and
overpowered
every
throb
of
duty
and
resistance
he
saw
nothing
of
her
when
he
reached
the
cove
he
could
think
of
no
excuse
for
calling
at
the
barrett
cottage
so
he
rode
slowly
past
the
hamlet
and
along
the
shore
the
sun
red
as
a
smouldering
ember
was
half
buried
in
the
silken
violet
rim
of
the
sea
the
west
was
a
vast
lake
of
saffron
and
rose
and
ethereal
green
through
which
floated
the
curved
shallop
of
a
thin
new
moon
slowly
deepening
from
lustreless
white
through
gleaming
silver
into
burnished
gold
and
attended
by
one
solitary
star
the
vast
concave
of
sky
above
was
of
violet
infinite
and
flawless
far
out
dusky
amethystine
islets
clustered
like
gems
on
the
shining
breast
of
the
bay
the
little
pools
of
water
along
the
low
shores
glowed
like
mirrors
of
polished
jacinth
the
small
headlands
ran
out
into
the
water
cutting
its
lustrous
blue
expanse
like
purple
wedges
as
esterbrook
turned
one
of
them
he
saw
magdalen
standing
out
on
the
point
of
the
next
a
short
distance
away
her
back
was
towards
him
and
her
splendid
figure
was
outlined
darkly
against
the
vivid
sky
esterbrook
sprang
from
his
horse
and
left
the
animal
standing
by
itself
while
he
walked
swiftly
out
to
her
his
heart
throbbed
suffocatingly
he
was
conscious
of
no
direct
purpose
save
merely
to
see
her
she
turned
when
he
reached
her
with
a
slight
start
of
surprise
his
footsteps
had
made
no
sound
on
the
sand
for
a
few
moments
they
faced
each
other
so
eyes
burning
into
eyes
with
mute
and
questioning
the
sun
had
disappeared
leaving
a
stain
of
fiery
red
to
mark
his
grave
the
weird
radiant
light
was
startlingly
vivid
and
clear
little
crisp
puffs
and
flakes
of
foam
scurried
over
the
point
like
elfin
things
the
fresh
wind
blowing
up
the
bay
tossed
the
lustrous
rings
of
hair
about
pale
face
all
the
routed
shadows
of
the
hour
had
found
refuge
in
her
eyes
not
a
trace
of
colour
appeared
in
her
face
under
esterbrook
burning
gaze
but
when
he
said
magdalen
a
single
hot
scorch
of
crimson
flamed
up
into
her
cheeks
protestingly
she
lifted
her
hand
with
a
splendid
gesture
but
no
word
passed
her
lips
magdalen
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
he
asked
coming
closer
to
her
with
an
imploring
passion
in
his
face
never
seen
by
marian
lesley
eyes
he
reached
out
his
hand
but
she
stepped
back
from
his
touch
what
should
i
have
to
say
to
you
say
that
you
are
glad
to
see
me
i
am
not
glad
to
see
you
you
have
no
right
to
come
here
but
i
knew
you
would
come
you
knew
it
how
your
eyes
told
me
so
today
i
am
not
blind
i
can
see
further
than
those
dull
fisher
folks
yes
i
knew
you
would
come
that
is
why
i
came
here
tonight
so
that
you
would
find
me
alone
and
i
could
tell
you
that
you
were
not
to
come
again
why
must
you
tell
me
that
magdalen
because
as
i
have
told
you
you
have
no
right
to
come
but
if
i
will
not
obey
you
if
i
will
come
in
defiance
of
your
prohibition
she
turned
her
steady
luminous
eyes
on
his
pale
set
face
you
would
stamp
yourself
as
a
madman
then
she
said
coldly
i
know
that
you
are
miss
lesley
promised
husband
therefore
you
are
either
false
to
her
or
insulting
to
me
in
either
case
the
companionship
of
magdalen
crawford
is
not
what
you
must
seek
go
she
turned
away
from
him
with
an
imperious
gesture
of
dismissal
esterbrook
elliott
stepped
forward
and
caught
one
firm
white
wrist
i
shall
not
obey
you
he
said
in
a
low
intense
tone
his
fine
eyes
burned
into
hers
you
may
send
me
away
but
i
will
come
back
again
and
yet
again
until
you
have
learned
to
welcome
me
why
should
you
meet
me
like
an
enemy
why
can
we
not
be
friends
the
girl
faced
him
once
more
because
she
said
proudly
i
am
not
your
equal
there
can
be
no
friendship
between
us
there
ought
not
to
be
magdalen
crawford
the
fisherman
niece
is
no
companion
for
you
you
will
be
foolish
as
well
as
disloyal
if
you
ever
try
to
see
me
again
go
back
to
the
beautiful
woman
you
love
and
forget
me
perhaps
you
think
i
am
talking
strangely
perhaps
you
think
me
bold
and
unwomanly
to
speak
so
plainly
to
you
a
stranger
but
there
are
some
circumstances
in
life
when
is
best
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
again
now
go
back
to
your
own
world
esterbrook
elliott
slowly
turned
from
her
and
walked
in
silence
back
to
the
shore
in
the
shadows
of
the
point
he
stopped
to
look
back
at
her
standing
out
like
some
inspired
prophetess
against
the
fiery
background
of
the
sunset
sky
and
water
the
sky
overhead
was
with
stars
the
night
breeze
was
blowing
up
from
its
lair
in
distant
echoing
sea
caves
on
his
right
the
lights
of
the
cove
twinkled
out
through
the
dusk
i
feel
like
a
coward
and
a
traitor
he
said
slowly
good
god
what
is
this
madness
that
has
come
over
me
is
this
my
boasted
strength
of
manhood
a
moment
later
the
hoof
beats
of
his
horse
died
away
up
the
shore
magdalen
crawford
lingered
on
the
point
until
the
last
dull
red
faded
out
into
the
violet
gloom
of
the
june
sea
dusk
than
which
nothing
can
be
rarer
or
diviner
and
listened
to
the
moan
and
murmur
of
the
sea
far
out
over
the
bay
with
sorrowful
eyes
and
sternly
set
lips
the
next
day
when
the
afternoon
sun
hung
hot
and
heavy
over
the
water
esterbrook
elliott
came
again
to
the
cove
he
found
it
deserted
a
rumour
of
mackerel
had
come
and
every
boat
had
sailed
out
in
the
dawn
to
the
fishing
grounds
but
down
on
a
strip
of
sparkling
yellow
sand
he
saw
magdalen
crawford
standing
her
hand
on
the
rope
that
fastened
a
small
white
dory
to
the
fragment
of
a
wreck
she
was
watching
a
huddle
of
gulls
clustered
on
the
tip
of
a
narrow
sandy
spit
running
out
to
the
left
she
turned
at
the
sound
of
his
hurried
behind
her
her
face
paled
slightly
and
into
the
depths
of
her
eyes
leapt
a
passionate
mesmeric
glow
that
faded
as
quickly
as
it
came
you
see
i
have
come
back
in
spite
of
your
command
magdalen
i
do
see
it
she
answered
in
a
gravely
troubled
voice
you
are
a
madman
who
refuses
to
be
warned
where
are
you
going
magdalen
she
had
loosened
the
rope
from
the
wreck
i
am
going
to
row
over
to
chapel
point
for
salt
they
think
the
boats
will
come
in
tonight
loaded
with
mackerel
look
at
them
away
out
there
by
the
score
and
salt
will
be
needed
can
you
row
so
far
alone
easily
i
learned
to
row
long
ago
for
a
pastime
then
since
coming
here
i
find
it
of
great
service
to
me
she
stepped
lightly
into
the
tiny
shallop
and
picked
up
an
oar
the
brilliant
sunshine
streamed
about
her
burnishing
the
rich
tints
of
her
hair
into
ruddy
gold
she
balanced
herself
to
the
swaying
of
the
dory
with
the
grace
of
a
sea
bird
the
man
looking
at
her
felt
his
brain
reel
mr
elliott
for
answer
he
sprang
into
the
dory
and
snatching
an
oar
pushed
against
the
old
wreck
with
such
energy
that
the
dory
shot
out
from
the
shore
like
a
foam
bell
his
sudden
spring
had
set
it
rocking
violently
magdalen
almost
lost
her
footing
and
caught
blindly
at
his
arm
as
her
fingers
closed
on
his
wrist
a
thrill
as
of
fire
shot
through
his
every
vein
why
have
you
done
this
elliott
you
must
go
back
but
i
will
not
he
said
masterfully
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
with
an
imperiousness
that
sat
well
upon
him
i
am
going
to
row
you
over
to
chapel
point
i
have
the
oars
i
will
be
master
this
once
at
least
for
an
instant
her
eyes
flashed
defiant
protest
then
drooped
before
his
a
sudden
hot
blush
crimsoned
her
pale
face
his
will
had
mastered
hers
the
girl
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
the
proud
sensitive
mouth
quivered
into
the
face
of
the
man
watching
her
breathlessly
flashed
a
triumphant
passionate
joy
he
put
out
his
hand
and
gently
pushed
her
down
into
the
seat
sitting
opposite
he
took
up
the
oars
and
pulled
out
over
the
sheet
of
sparkling
blue
water
through
which
at
first
the
bottom
of
white
sand
glimmered
wavily
but
afterwards
deepened
to
translucent
dim
depths
of
greenness
his
heart
throbbed
tumultuously
once
the
thought
of
marian
drifted
across
his
mind
like
a
chill
breath
of
wind
but
it
was
forgotten
when
his
eyes
met
magdalen
tell
me
about
yourself
magdalen
he
said
at
last
breaking
the
tremulous
charmed
sparkling
silence
there
is
nothing
to
tell
she
answered
with
characteristic
straightforwardness
my
life
has
been
a
very
uneventful
one
i
have
never
been
rich
or
very
well
educated
but
it
used
to
be
different
from
now
i
had
some
chance
before
before
father
died
you
must
have
found
it
very
lonely
and
strange
when
you
came
here
first
yes
at
first
i
thought
i
should
die
but
i
do
not
mind
it
now
i
have
made
friends
with
the
sea
it
has
taught
me
a
great
deal
there
is
a
kind
of
inspiration
in
the
sea
when
one
listens
to
its
murmur
afar
out
there
always
sounding
at
midnight
and
midday
one
soul
goes
out
to
meet
eternity
sometimes
it
gives
me
so
much
pleasure
that
it
is
almost
pain
she
stopped
abruptly
i
do
know
why
i
am
talking
to
you
like
this
you
are
a
strange
girl
magdalen
have
you
no
other
companion
than
the
sea
no
why
should
i
wish
to
have
i
shall
not
be
here
long
elliott
face
contracted
with
a
spasm
of
pain
you
are
not
going
away
magdalen
yes
in
the
fall
i
have
my
own
living
to
earn
you
know
i
am
very
poor
uncle
and
aunt
are
very
kind
but
i
can
not
consent
to
burden
them
any
longer
than
i
can
help
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
moan
broke
from
esterbrook
elliott
lips
you
must
not
go
away
magdalen
you
must
stay
here
with
me
you
forget
yourself
she
said
proudly
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
so
have
you
forgotten
miss
lesley
or
are
you
a
traitor
to
us
both
esterbrook
made
no
answer
he
bowed
his
pale
miserable
face
before
her
the
breast
of
the
bay
sparkled
with
its
countless
gems
like
the
breast
of
a
fair
woman
the
shores
were
purple
and
amethystine
in
the
distance
far
out
bluish
sails
clustered
against
the
pallid
horizon
the
dory
danced
like
a
feather
over
the
ripples
they
were
close
under
the
shadow
of
chapel
point
marian
lesley
waited
in
vain
for
her
lover
that
afternoon
when
he
came
at
last
in
the
odorous
dusk
of
the
june
night
she
met
him
on
the
verandah
with
cold
sweetness
perhaps
some
subtle
whispered
to
her
where
and
how
he
had
spent
the
afternoon
for
she
offered
him
no
kiss
nor
did
she
ask
him
why
he
had
failed
to
come
sooner
his
eyes
lingered
on
her
in
the
dim
light
taking
in
every
detail
of
her
sweet
womanly
refinement
and
loveliness
and
with
difficulty
he
choked
back
a
groan
again
he
asked
himself
what
madness
had
come
over
him
and
again
for
an
answer
rose
up
the
vision
of
magdalen
face
as
he
had
seen
it
that
day
crimsoning
beneath
his
gaze
it
was
late
when
he
left
marian
watched
him
out
of
sight
standing
under
the
acacias
she
shivered
as
with
a
sudden
chill
i
feel
as
i
think
vashti
must
have
felt
she
murmured
aloud
when
discrowned
and
unqueened
she
crept
out
of
the
gates
of
shushan
to
hide
her
broken
heart
i
wonder
if
esther
has
already
usurped
my
sceptre
has
that
girl
at
the
cove
with
her
pale
face
and
mysterious
eyes
stolen
his
heart
from
me
perhaps
not
for
it
may
never
have
been
mine
i
know
that
esterbrook
elliott
will
be
true
to
the
letter
of
his
vows
to
me
no
matter
what
it
may
cost
him
but
i
want
no
pallid
shadow
of
the
love
that
belongs
to
another
the
hour
of
abdication
is
at
hand
i
fear
and
what
will
be
left
for
throneless
vashti
then
esterbrook
elliott
walking
home
through
the
mocking
calm
of
the
night
fought
a
hard
battle
with
himself
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
truth
at
last
the
bitter
knowledge
that
he
had
never
loved
marian
lesley
save
with
a
fond
brotherly
affection
and
that
he
did
love
magdalen
crawford
with
a
passion
that
threatened
to
sweep
before
it
every
vestige
of
his
honour
and
loyalty
he
had
seen
her
but
three
times
and
his
throbbing
heart
lay
in
the
hollow
of
her
cold
white
hand
he
shut
his
eyes
and
groaned
what
madness
what
unutterable
folly
he
was
not
free
he
was
bound
to
another
by
every
cord
of
honour
and
and
even
were
he
free
magdalen
crawford
would
be
no
fit
wife
for
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
at
least
a
girl
from
the
cove
a
girl
with
little
education
and
no
social
standing
aye
but
he
loved
her
he
groaned
again
and
again
in
his
misery
afar
down
the
slope
the
bay
waters
lay
like
an
inky
strip
and
the
distant
murmurous
plaint
of
the
sea
came
out
of
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
lights
at
the
cove
glimmered
faintly
in
the
week
that
followed
he
went
to
the
cove
every
day
sometimes
he
did
not
see
magdalen
at
other
times
he
did
but
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
had
conquered
in
the
bitter
struggle
with
himself
if
he
had
weakly
given
way
to
the
first
mad
sweep
of
a
new
passion
the
strength
of
his
manhood
reasserted
itself
at
last
faltering
and
wavering
were
over
though
there
was
passionate
pain
in
his
voice
when
he
said
at
last
i
am
not
coming
back
again
magdalen
they
were
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
point
that
ran
out
to
the
left
of
the
cove
they
had
been
walking
together
along
the
shore
watching
the
splendour
of
the
sea
sunset
that
flamed
and
glowed
in
the
west
where
there
was
a
sea
of
mackerel
clouds
crimson
and
amber
tinted
with
long
strips
of
sky
between
they
had
walked
in
silence
hand
in
hand
as
children
might
have
done
yet
with
the
stir
and
throb
of
a
mighty
passion
seething
in
their
hearts
magdalen
turned
as
esterbrook
spoke
and
looked
at
him
in
a
long
silence
the
bay
stretched
out
before
them
tranced
and
shimmering
a
few
stars
shone
down
through
the
gloom
of
dusk
right
across
the
translucent
greens
and
roses
and
blues
of
the
west
hung
a
dark
unsightly
cloud
like
the
blurred
outline
of
a
monstrous
bat
in
the
dim
reflected
light
the
girl
mournful
face
took
on
a
weird
unearthly
beauty
she
turned
her
eyes
from
esterbrook
elliott
set
white
face
to
the
radiant
gloom
of
the
sea
that
is
best
she
answered
at
last
slowly
best
yes
better
that
we
had
never
met
i
love
you
you
know
it
words
are
idle
between
us
i
never
loved
before
i
thought
i
did
i
made
a
mistake
and
i
must
pay
the
penalty
of
that
mistake
you
understand
me
i
understand
she
answered
simply
i
do
not
excuse
myself
i
have
been
weak
and
cowardly
and
disloyal
but
i
have
conquered
myself
i
will
be
true
to
the
woman
to
whom
i
am
pledged
you
and
i
must
not
meet
again
i
will
crush
this
madness
to
death
i
think
i
have
been
delirious
ever
since
that
day
i
saw
you
first
magdalen
my
brain
is
clearer
now
i
see
my
duty
and
i
mean
to
do
it
at
any
cost
i
dare
not
trust
myself
to
say
more
magdalen
i
have
much
for
which
to
ask
your
forgiveness
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
she
said
steadily
i
have
been
as
much
to
blame
as
you
if
i
had
been
as
resolute
as
i
ought
to
have
been
if
i
had
sent
you
away
the
second
time
as
i
did
the
first
this
would
not
have
come
to
pass
i
have
been
weak
too
and
i
deserve
to
atone
for
my
weakness
by
suffering
there
is
only
one
path
open
to
us
esterbrook
her
voice
quivered
with
an
uncontrollable
spasm
of
pain
but
the
misty
mournful
eyes
did
not
swerve
from
his
the
man
stepped
forward
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
magdalen
my
darling
kiss
me
once
only
once
before
i
go
she
loosened
his
arms
and
stepped
back
proudly
no
no
man
kisses
my
lips
unless
he
is
to
be
my
husband
dear
he
bowed
his
head
silently
and
went
away
looking
back
not
once
else
he
might
have
seen
her
kneeling
on
the
damp
sand
weeping
noiselessly
and
passionately
marian
lesley
looked
at
his
pale
determined
face
the
next
evening
and
read
it
like
an
open
book
she
had
grown
paler
herself
there
were
purple
shadows
under
the
sweet
violet
eyes
that
might
have
hinted
of
her
own
sleepless
nights
she
greeted
him
calmly
holding
out
a
steady
white
hand
of
welcome
she
saw
the
traces
of
the
struggle
through
which
he
had
passed
and
knew
that
he
had
come
off
victor
the
knowledge
made
her
task
a
little
harder
it
would
have
been
easier
to
let
slip
the
straining
cable
than
to
cast
it
from
her
when
it
lay
unresistingly
in
her
hand
for
an
instant
her
heart
thrilled
with
an
unutterably
sweet
hope
might
he
not
forget
in
time
need
she
snap
in
twain
the
weakened
bond
between
them
after
all
perhaps
she
might
win
back
her
lost
sceptre
yet
if
womanly
pride
throttled
the
struggling
hope
no
divided
allegiance
no
hollow
semblance
of
queenship
for
her
her
opportunity
came
when
esterbrook
asked
with
grave
earnestness
if
their
marriage
might
not
be
hastened
a
little
could
he
not
have
his
bride
in
august
for
a
fleeting
second
marian
closed
her
eyes
and
the
slender
hands
lying
among
the
laces
in
her
lap
clasped
each
other
convulsively
then
she
said
quietly
sometimes
i
have
thought
esterbrook
that
it
might
be
better
if
we
were
never
married
at
all
esterbrook
turned
a
startled
face
upon
her
not
married
at
all
marian
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
i
do
not
think
we
are
as
well
suited
to
each
other
after
all
as
we
have
fancied
we
have
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
might
that
is
all
i
think
it
will
be
best
to
be
brother
and
sister
forever
nothing
more
esterbrook
sprang
to
his
feet
marian
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
you
surely
can
not
have
heard
no
one
could
have
told
you
i
have
heard
nothing
she
interrupted
hurriedly
no
one
has
told
me
anything
i
have
only
said
what
i
have
been
thinking
of
late
i
am
sure
we
have
made
a
mistake
it
is
not
too
late
to
remedy
it
you
will
not
refuse
my
request
esterbrook
you
will
set
me
free
good
heavens
marian
he
said
hoarsely
i
can
not
realize
that
you
are
in
earnest
have
you
ceased
to
care
for
me
the
rigidly
locked
hands
were
clasped
a
little
tighter
no
i
shall
always
care
for
you
as
my
friend
if
you
will
let
me
but
i
know
we
could
not
make
each
other
happy
the
time
for
that
has
gone
by
i
would
never
be
satisfied
nor
would
you
esterbrook
will
you
release
me
from
a
promise
which
has
become
an
irksome
fetter
he
looked
down
on
her
upturned
face
mistily
a
great
joy
was
surging
up
in
his
heart
yet
it
was
mingled
with
great
regret
he
knew
none
better
what
was
passing
out
of
his
life
what
he
was
losing
when
he
lost
that
pure
womanly
nature
if
you
really
mean
this
marian
he
said
slowly
if
you
really
have
come
to
feel
that
your
truest
love
is
not
and
never
can
be
mine
that
i
can
not
make
you
happy
then
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
grant
your
request
you
are
free
thank
you
dear
she
said
gently
as
she
stood
up
she
slipped
his
ring
from
her
finger
and
held
it
out
to
him
he
took
it
mechanically
he
still
felt
dazed
and
unreal
marian
held
out
her
hand
esterbrook
she
said
a
little
wearily
i
feel
tired
i
am
glad
you
see
it
all
in
the
same
light
as
i
do
marian
he
said
earnestly
clasping
the
outstretched
hand
are
you
sure
that
you
will
be
happy
are
you
sure
that
you
are
doing
a
wise
thing
quite
sure
she
answered
with
a
faint
smile
i
am
not
acting
rashly
i
have
thought
it
all
over
carefully
things
are
much
better
so
dear
we
will
always
be
friends
your
joys
and
sorrows
will
be
to
me
as
my
own
when
another
love
comes
to
bless
your
life
esterbrook
i
will
be
glad
and
now
i
want
to
be
alone
now
at
the
doorway
he
turned
to
look
back
at
her
standing
in
all
her
sweet
stateliness
in
the
twilight
duskness
and
the
keen
realization
of
all
he
had
lost
made
him
bow
his
head
with
a
quick
pang
of
regret
then
he
went
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
summer
night
an
hour
later
he
stood
alone
on
the
little
point
where
he
had
parted
with
magdalen
the
night
before
a
restless
night
wind
was
moaning
through
the
pines
that
fringed
the
bank
behind
him
the
moon
shone
down
radiantly
turning
the
calm
expanse
of
the
bay
into
a
sheen
he
took
marian
ring
from
his
pocket
and
kissed
it
reverently
then
he
threw
it
from
him
far
out
over
the
water
for
a
second
the
diamond
flashed
in
the
moonlight
then
with
a
tiny
splash
it
fell
among
the
ripples
esterbrook
turned
his
face
to
the
cove
lying
dark
and
silent
in
the
curve
between
the
crescent
headlands
a
solitary
light
glimmered
from
the
low
eaves
of
the
barrett
cottage
tomorrow
was
his
unspoken
thought
i
will
be
free
to
go
back
to
magdalen
an
invitation
given
on
impulse
it
was
a
gloomy
saturday
morning
the
trees
in
the
oaklawn
grounds
were
tossing
wildly
in
the
gusts
of
wind
and
sodden
brown
leaves
were
blown
up
against
the
windows
of
the
library
where
a
score
of
girls
were
waiting
for
the
principal
to
bring
the
mail
in
the
big
room
echoed
with
the
pleasant
sound
of
girlish
voices
and
low
laughter
for
in
a
fortnight
school
would
close
for
the
holidays
and
they
were
all
talking
about
their
plans
and
anticipations
only
ruth
mannering
was
as
usual
sitting
by
herself
near
one
of
the
windows
looking
out
on
the
misty
lawn
she
was
a
pale
slender
girl
with
a
sad
face
and
was
dressed
in
rather
shabby
black
she
had
no
special
friend
at
oaklawn
and
the
other
girls
did
not
know
much
about
her
if
they
had
thought
about
it
at
all
they
would
probably
have
decided
that
they
did
not
like
her
but
for
the
most
part
they
simply
overlooked
her
this
was
not
altogether
their
fault
ruth
was
poor
and
apparently
friendless
but
it
was
not
her
poverty
that
was
against
her
lou
scott
who
was
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
to
quote
her
own
frank
admission
was
the
most
popular
girl
in
the
seminary
the
boon
companion
of
the
richest
girls
and
in
demand
with
everybody
but
lou
was
jolly
and
frank
and
offhanded
while
ruth
was
painfully
shy
and
reserved
and
that
was
the
secret
of
the
whole
matter
there
was
no
fun
in
her
the
girls
said
and
so
it
came
about
that
she
was
left
out
of
their
social
life
and
was
almost
as
solitary
at
oaklawn
as
if
she
had
been
the
only
girl
there
she
was
there
for
the
special
purpose
of
studying
music
and
expected
to
earn
her
own
living
by
teaching
it
when
she
left
she
believed
that
the
girls
looked
down
on
her
on
this
account
this
was
unjust
of
course
but
ruth
had
no
idea
how
much
her
own
coldness
and
reserve
had
worked
against
her
across
the
room
carol
golden
was
as
usual
the
centre
of
an
animated
group
golden
carol
as
her
particular
friends
sometimes
called
her
partly
because
of
her
beautiful
voice
and
partly
because
of
her
wonderful
fleece
of
golden
hair
carol
was
one
of
the
seminary
pets
and
seemed
to
ruth
mannering
to
have
everything
that
she
had
not
presently
the
mail
was
brought
in
and
there
was
a
rush
to
the
table
followed
by
exclamations
of
satisfaction
or
disappointment
in
a
few
minutes
the
room
was
almost
deserted
only
two
girls
remained
carol
golden
who
had
dropped
into
a
big
chair
to
read
her
many
letters
and
ruth
mannering
who
had
not
received
any
and
had
gone
silently
back
to
her
part
of
the
window
presently
carol
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
her
mother
had
written
that
she
might
invite
any
friend
she
wished
home
with
her
to
spend
the
holidays
carol
had
asked
for
this
permission
and
now
that
it
had
come
was
ready
to
dance
for
joy
as
to
whom
she
would
ask
there
could
be
only
one
answer
to
that
of
course
it
must
be
her
particular
friend
maud
russell
who
was
the
cleverest
and
prettiest
girl
at
oaklawn
at
least
so
her
admirers
said
she
was
undoubtedly
the
richest
and
was
the
acknowledged
leader
the
girls
affectionately
called
her
princess
and
carol
adored
her
with
that
romantic
affection
that
is
found
only
among
school
girls
she
knew
too
that
maud
would
surely
accept
her
invitation
because
she
did
not
intend
to
go
home
her
parents
were
travelling
in
europe
and
she
expected
to
spend
her
holidays
with
some
cousins
who
were
almost
strangers
to
her
carol
was
so
much
pleased
that
she
felt
as
if
she
must
talk
to
somebody
so
she
turned
to
ruth
is
it
delightful
to
think
that
we
all
be
going
home
in
a
fortnight
yes
very
for
those
that
have
homes
to
go
to
said
ruth
drearily
carol
felt
a
quick
pang
of
pity
and
have
you
she
asked
ruth
shook
her
head
in
spite
of
herself
the
kindness
of
carol
tone
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
my
mother
died
a
year
ago
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
and
since
then
i
have
had
no
real
home
we
were
quite
alone
in
the
world
mother
and
i
and
now
i
have
nobody
oh
i
so
sorry
for
you
cried
carol
impulsively
she
leaned
forward
and
took
ruth
hand
in
a
gentle
way
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
to
stay
here
all
through
the
holidays
why
it
will
be
horrid
oh
i
shall
not
mind
it
much
said
ruth
quickly
with
study
and
practice
most
of
the
time
only
now
when
everyone
is
talking
about
it
it
makes
me
wish
that
i
had
some
place
to
go
carol
dropped
ruth
hand
suddenly
in
the
shock
of
a
sudden
idea
that
darted
into
her
mind
a
stray
girl
passing
through
the
hall
called
out
ruth
miss
siviter
wishes
to
see
you
about
something
in
room
ruth
got
up
quickly
she
was
glad
to
get
away
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
another
minute
she
would
break
down
altogether
carol
golden
hardly
noticed
her
departure
she
gathered
up
her
letters
and
went
abstractedly
to
her
room
unheeding
a
gay
call
for
golden
carol
from
a
group
of
girls
in
the
corridor
maud
russell
was
not
in
and
carol
was
glad
she
wanted
to
be
alone
and
fight
down
that
sudden
idea
it
is
ridiculous
to
think
of
it
she
said
aloud
with
a
petulance
very
unusual
in
golden
carol
whose
disposition
was
as
sunny
as
her
looks
why
i
simply
can
not
i
have
always
been
longing
to
ask
maud
to
visit
me
and
now
that
the
chance
has
come
i
am
not
going
to
throw
it
away
i
am
very
sorry
for
ruth
of
course
it
must
be
dreadful
to
be
all
alone
like
that
but
it
is
my
fault
and
she
is
so
fearfully
quiet
and
dowdy
what
would
they
all
think
of
her
at
home
frank
and
jack
would
make
such
fun
of
her
i
shall
ask
maud
just
as
soon
as
she
comes
in
maud
did
come
in
presently
but
carol
did
not
give
her
the
invitation
instead
she
was
almost
snappish
to
her
idol
and
the
princess
soon
went
out
again
in
something
of
a
huff
oh
dear
cried
carol
now
i
offended
her
what
has
got
into
me
what
a
disagreeable
thing
a
conscience
is
although
i
sure
i
know
why
mine
should
be
prodding
me
so
i
do
want
to
invite
ruth
mannering
home
with
me
for
the
holidays
but
i
feel
exactly
as
if
i
should
not
have
a
minute
peace
of
mind
all
the
time
if
i
did
mother
would
think
it
all
right
of
course
she
would
not
mind
if
ruth
dressed
in
calico
and
never
said
anything
but
yes
and
no
but
how
the
boys
would
laugh
i
simply
wo
do
it
conscience
or
no
conscience
in
view
of
this
decision
it
was
rather
strange
that
the
next
morning
carol
golden
went
down
to
ruth
mannering
lonely
little
room
on
corridor
two
and
said
ruth
will
you
go
home
with
me
for
the
holidays
mother
wrote
me
to
invite
anyone
i
wished
to
do
say
you
ca
come
dear
because
you
must
carol
never
as
long
as
she
lived
forgot
ruth
face
at
that
moment
it
was
absolutely
transfigured
she
said
afterwards
i
never
saw
anyone
look
so
happy
in
my
life
a
fortnight
later
unwonted
silence
reigned
at
oaklawn
the
girls
were
scattered
far
and
wide
and
ruth
mannering
and
carol
golden
were
at
the
latter
home
carol
was
a
very
much
surprised
girl
under
the
influence
of
kindness
and
pleasure
ruth
seemed
transformed
into
a
different
person
her
shyness
and
reserve
melted
away
in
the
sunny
atmosphere
of
the
golden
home
golden
took
her
into
her
motherly
heart
at
once
and
as
for
frank
and
jack
whose
verdict
carol
had
so
dreaded
they
voted
ruth
splendid
she
certainly
got
along
very
well
with
them
and
if
she
did
not
make
the
social
sensation
that
pretty
maud
russell
might
have
made
the
goldens
all
liked
her
and
carol
was
content
just
four
days
more
sighed
carol
one
afternoon
and
then
we
must
go
back
to
oaklawn
can
you
realize
it
ruth
ruth
looked
up
from
her
book
with
a
smile
even
in
appearance
she
had
changed
there
was
a
faint
pink
in
her
cheeks
and
a
merry
light
in
her
eyes
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
go
back
to
work
she
said
i
feel
just
like
it
because
i
have
had
so
pleasant
a
time
here
that
it
has
heartened
me
up
for
next
term
i
think
it
will
be
very
different
from
last
i
begin
to
see
that
i
kept
to
myself
too
much
and
brooded
over
fancied
slights
and
then
you
are
to
room
with
me
since
maud
is
not
coming
back
said
carol
what
fun
we
shall
have
did
you
ever
toast
marshmallows
over
the
gas
why
i
declare
there
is
mr
swift
coming
up
the
walk
look
ruth
he
is
the
richest
man
in
westleigh
ruth
peeped
out
of
the
window
over
carol
shoulder
he
reminds
me
of
somebody
she
said
absently
but
i
ca
think
who
it
is
of
course
i
have
never
seen
him
before
what
a
good
face
he
has
he
is
as
good
as
he
looks
said
carol
enthusiastically
next
to
father
mr
swift
is
the
nicest
man
in
the
world
i
have
always
been
quite
a
pet
of
his
his
wife
is
dead
and
so
is
his
only
daughter
she
was
a
lovely
girl
and
died
only
two
years
ago
it
nearly
broke
mr
swift
heart
and
he
has
lived
alone
ever
since
in
that
great
big
house
up
at
the
head
of
warner
street
the
one
you
admired
so
ruth
the
last
time
we
were
uptown
there
the
bell
for
the
second
time
mary
ca
have
heard
it
i
go
myself
as
carol
showed
the
caller
into
the
room
ruth
rose
to
leave
and
thus
came
face
to
face
with
him
mr
swift
started
perceptibly
mr
swift
this
is
my
school
friend
miss
mannering
said
carol
mr
swift
seemed
strangely
agitated
as
he
took
ruth
timidly
offered
hand
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
hurriedly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
what
may
seem
a
very
strange
question
what
was
your
mother
name
agnes
hastings
answered
ruth
in
surprise
and
then
carol
really
thought
that
mr
swift
had
gone
crazy
for
he
drew
ruth
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
i
knew
it
he
said
i
was
sure
you
were
agnes
daughter
for
you
are
the
living
image
of
what
she
was
when
i
last
saw
her
child
you
do
know
me
but
i
am
your
uncle
robert
your
mother
was
my
oh
mr
swift
cried
carol
and
then
she
ran
for
her
mother
ruth
turned
pale
and
dropped
into
a
chair
and
mr
swift
sat
down
beside
her
to
think
that
i
have
found
you
at
last
child
how
puzzled
you
look
did
your
mother
never
speak
of
me
how
is
she
where
is
she
mother
died
last
year
said
ruth
poor
agnes
and
i
never
knew
do
cry
little
girl
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
it
she
was
much
younger
than
i
was
and
when
our
mother
died
my
stepfather
went
away
and
took
her
with
him
i
remained
with
my
father
people
and
eventually
lost
all
trace
of
my
sister
i
was
a
poor
boy
then
but
things
have
looked
up
with
me
and
i
have
often
tried
to
find
her
by
this
time
carol
had
returned
with
her
father
and
mother
and
there
was
a
scene
laughing
crying
explaining
and
i
do
really
know
which
of
the
two
girls
was
the
more
excited
carol
or
ruth
as
for
mr
swift
he
was
overjoyed
to
find
his
niece
and
wanted
to
carry
her
off
with
him
then
and
there
but
golden
insisted
on
her
finishing
her
visit
when
the
question
of
returning
to
oaklawn
came
up
mr
swift
would
not
hear
of
it
at
first
but
finally
yielded
to
entreaties
and
ruth
own
desire
i
shall
graduate
next
year
uncle
and
then
i
can
come
back
to
you
for
good
that
evening
when
ruth
was
alone
in
her
room
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
realize
that
the
home
and
love
that
she
had
so
craved
were
really
to
be
hers
at
last
golden
carol
was
with
her
mother
in
the
room
below
talking
it
all
over
just
think
mother
if
i
had
not
asked
ruth
to
come
here
this
would
not
have
happened
and
i
did
want
to
i
wanted
to
ask
maud
so
much
and
i
was
dreadfully
disappointed
when
i
could
for
i
really
could
i
could
not
help
remembering
the
look
in
ruth
eyes
when
she
said
that
she
had
no
home
to
go
to
and
so
i
asked
her
instead
of
maud
how
dreadful
it
would
have
been
if
i
had
detected
by
the
camera
one
summer
i
was
attacked
by
the
craze
for
amateur
photography
it
became
chronic
afterwards
and
i
and
my
camera
have
never
since
been
parted
we
have
had
some
odd
adventures
together
and
one
of
the
most
novel
of
our
experiences
was
that
in
which
we
played
the
part
of
chief
witness
against
ned
brooke
i
may
say
that
my
name
is
amy
clarke
and
that
i
believe
i
am
considered
the
best
amateur
photographer
in
our
part
of
the
country
that
is
all
i
need
tell
you
about
myself
carroll
had
asked
me
to
photograph
his
place
for
him
when
the
apple
orchards
were
in
bloom
he
has
a
picturesque
country
house
behind
a
lawn
of
the
most
delightful
old
trees
and
flanked
on
each
side
by
the
orchards
so
i
went
one
june
afternoon
with
all
my
accoutrements
prepared
to
take
the
carroll
establishment
in
my
best
style
carroll
was
away
but
was
expected
home
soon
so
we
waited
for
him
as
all
the
family
wished
to
be
photographed
under
the
big
maple
at
the
front
door
i
prowled
around
among
the
shrubbery
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lawn
and
after
a
great
deal
of
squinting
from
various
angles
i
at
last
fixed
upon
the
spot
from
which
i
thought
the
best
view
of
the
house
might
be
obtained
then
gertie
and
lilian
carroll
and
i
got
into
the
hammocks
and
swung
at
our
leisure
enjoying
the
cool
breeze
sweeping
through
the
maples
ned
brooke
was
hanging
around
as
usual
watching
us
furtively
ned
was
one
of
the
hopeful
members
of
a
family
that
lived
in
a
shanty
just
across
the
road
from
the
carrolls
they
were
wretchedly
poor
and
old
brooke
as
he
was
called
and
ned
were
employed
a
good
deal
by
carroll
more
out
of
charity
than
anything
else
i
fancy
the
brookes
had
a
rather
shady
reputation
they
were
notoriously
lazy
and
it
was
suspected
that
their
line
of
distinction
between
their
own
and
their
neighbours
goods
was
not
very
clearly
drawn
many
people
censured
carroll
for
encouraging
them
at
all
but
he
was
too
to
let
them
suffer
actual
want
and
as
a
consequence
one
or
the
other
of
them
was
always
dodging
about
his
place
ned
was
a
lank
youth
of
about
fourteen
with
shifty
twinkling
eyes
that
could
never
look
you
straight
in
the
face
his
appearance
was
anything
but
prepossessing
and
i
always
felt
when
i
looked
at
him
that
if
anyone
wanted
to
do
a
piece
of
shady
work
by
proxy
ned
brooke
would
be
the
very
lad
for
the
business
carroll
came
at
last
and
we
all
went
down
to
meet
him
at
the
gate
ned
brooke
also
came
shuffling
along
to
take
the
horse
and
carroll
tossed
the
reins
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
handed
a
pocketbook
to
his
wife
just
as
well
to
be
careful
where
you
put
that
he
said
laughingly
there
a
sum
in
it
not
to
be
picked
up
on
every
gooseberry
bush
gilman
harris
paid
me
this
morning
for
that
bit
of
woodland
i
sold
him
last
fall
five
hundred
dollars
i
promised
that
you
and
the
girls
should
have
it
to
get
a
new
piano
so
there
it
is
for
you
thank
you
said
carroll
delightedly
however
you
better
put
it
back
in
your
pocket
till
we
go
in
amy
is
in
a
hurry
carroll
took
back
the
pocketbook
and
dropped
it
carelessly
into
the
inside
pocket
of
the
light
overcoat
that
he
wore
i
happened
to
glance
at
ned
brooke
just
then
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
sudden
crafty
eager
expression
that
flashed
over
his
face
he
eyed
the
pocketbook
in
carroll
hands
furtively
after
which
he
went
off
with
the
horse
in
a
great
hurry
the
girls
were
exclaiming
and
thanking
their
father
and
nobody
noticed
ned
brooke
behaviour
but
myself
and
it
soon
passed
out
of
my
mind
come
to
take
the
place
are
you
amy
said
carroll
well
everything
is
ready
i
think
i
suppose
we
better
proceed
where
shall
we
stand
you
had
better
group
us
as
you
think
best
whereupon
i
proceeded
to
arrange
them
in
due
order
under
the
maple
carroll
sat
in
a
chair
while
her
husband
stood
behind
her
gertie
stood
on
the
steps
with
a
basket
of
flowers
in
her
hand
and
lilian
was
at
one
side
the
two
little
boys
teddy
and
jack
climbed
up
into
the
maple
and
little
dora
the
dimpled
stood
gravely
in
the
foreground
with
an
enormous
grey
cat
hugged
in
her
chubby
arms
it
was
a
pretty
group
in
a
pretty
setting
and
i
thrilled
with
professional
pride
as
i
stepped
back
for
a
final
knowing
squint
at
it
all
then
i
went
to
my
camera
slipped
in
the
plate
gave
them
due
warning
and
took
off
the
cap
i
took
two
plates
to
make
sure
and
then
the
thing
was
over
but
as
i
had
another
plate
left
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
a
view
of
the
house
by
itself
so
i
carried
my
camera
to
a
new
place
and
had
just
got
everything
ready
to
lift
the
cap
when
carroll
came
down
and
said
if
you
girls
want
to
see
something
pretty
come
to
the
back
field
with
me
that
will
wait
till
you
come
back
wo
it
amy
so
we
all
betook
ourselves
to
the
back
field
a
short
distance
away
where
carroll
proudly
displayed
two
of
the
prettiest
little
jersey
cows
i
had
ever
seen
we
returned
to
the
house
by
way
of
the
back
lane
and
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
main
road
my
brother
cecil
drove
up
and
said
that
if
i
were
ready
i
had
better
go
home
with
him
and
save
myself
a
hot
dusty
walk
the
carrolls
all
went
down
to
the
fence
to
speak
to
cecil
but
i
dashed
hurriedly
down
through
the
orchard
leaped
over
the
fence
into
the
lawn
and
ran
to
the
somewhat
remote
corner
where
i
had
left
my
camera
i
was
in
a
desperate
hurry
for
i
knew
cecil
horse
did
not
like
to
be
kept
waiting
so
i
never
even
glanced
at
the
house
but
snatched
off
the
cap
counted
two
and
replaced
it
then
i
took
out
my
plate
put
it
in
the
holder
and
gathered
up
my
traps
i
suppose
i
was
about
five
minutes
at
it
all
and
i
had
my
back
to
the
house
the
whole
time
and
when
i
laid
all
my
things
ready
and
emerged
from
my
retreat
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
about
the
place
as
i
hurried
up
through
the
lawn
i
noticed
ned
brooke
walking
at
a
smart
pace
down
the
lane
but
the
fact
did
not
make
any
particular
impression
on
me
at
the
time
and
was
not
recalled
until
afterwards
cecil
was
waiting
for
me
so
i
got
in
the
buggy
and
we
drove
off
on
arriving
home
i
shut
myself
up
in
my
dark
room
and
proceeded
to
develop
the
first
two
negatives
of
the
carroll
housestead
they
were
both
excellent
the
first
one
being
a
trifle
the
better
so
that
i
decided
to
finish
from
it
i
intended
also
to
develop
the
third
but
just
as
i
finished
the
others
a
city
cousins
swooped
down
upon
us
and
i
had
to
put
away
my
paraphernalia
emerge
from
my
dark
retreat
and
fly
around
to
entertain
them
the
next
day
cecil
came
in
and
said
did
you
hear
amy
that
carroll
has
lost
a
pocketbook
with
five
hundred
dollars
in
it
no
i
exclaimed
how
when
where
do
overwhelm
a
fellow
i
can
answer
only
one
question
last
night
as
to
the
they
do
know
and
as
to
the
well
if
they
knew
that
there
might
be
some
hope
of
finding
it
the
girls
are
in
a
bad
way
the
money
was
to
get
them
their
piano
it
seems
and
now
it
gone
but
how
did
it
happen
cecil
well
carroll
says
that
carroll
handed
the
pocketbook
back
to
him
at
the
gate
yesterday
and
he
dropped
it
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
i
saw
him
do
it
i
cried
yes
and
then
before
he
went
to
be
photographed
he
hung
his
coat
up
in
the
hall
it
hung
there
until
the
evening
and
nobody
seems
to
have
thought
about
the
money
each
supposing
that
someone
else
had
put
it
carefully
away
after
tea
carroll
put
on
the
coat
and
went
to
see
somebody
over
at
netherby
he
says
the
thought
of
the
pocketbook
never
crossed
his
mind
he
had
forgotten
all
about
putting
it
in
that
coat
pocket
he
came
home
across
the
fields
about
eleven
and
found
that
the
cows
had
broken
into
the
clover
hay
and
he
had
a
great
chase
before
he
got
them
out
when
he
went
in
just
as
he
entered
the
door
the
remembrance
of
the
money
flashed
over
him
he
felt
in
his
pocket
but
there
was
no
pocketbook
there
he
asked
his
wife
if
she
had
taken
it
out
she
had
not
and
nobody
else
had
there
was
a
hole
in
the
pocket
but
carroll
says
it
was
too
small
for
the
pocketbook
to
have
worked
through
however
it
must
have
done
so
unless
someone
took
it
out
of
his
pocket
at
netherby
and
that
is
not
possible
because
he
never
had
his
coat
off
and
it
was
in
an
inside
pocket
it
not
likely
that
they
will
ever
see
it
again
someone
may
pick
it
up
of
course
but
the
chances
are
slim
carroll
does
know
his
exact
path
across
the
fields
and
if
he
lost
it
while
he
was
after
the
cows
it
a
bluer
show
still
they
been
searching
all
day
of
course
the
girls
are
awfully
disappointed
a
sudden
recollection
came
to
me
of
ned
brooke
face
as
i
had
seen
it
the
day
before
at
the
gate
coupled
with
the
remembrance
of
seeing
him
walking
down
the
lane
at
a
quick
pace
so
unlike
his
usual
shambling
gait
while
i
ran
through
the
lawn
how
do
they
know
it
was
lost
i
said
perhaps
it
was
stolen
before
carroll
went
to
netherby
they
think
not
said
cecil
who
would
have
stolen
it
ned
brooke
i
saw
him
hanging
around
and
you
never
saw
such
a
look
as
came
over
his
face
when
he
heard
carroll
say
there
was
five
hundred
dollars
in
that
pocketbook
well
i
did
suggest
to
them
that
ned
might
know
something
about
it
for
i
remembered
having
seen
him
go
down
the
lane
while
i
was
waiting
for
you
but
they
wo
hear
of
such
a
thing
the
brookes
are
kind
of
protégés
of
theirs
you
know
and
they
wo
believe
anything
bad
of
them
if
ned
did
take
it
however
there
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
against
him
no
i
suppose
not
i
answered
thoughtfully
but
the
more
i
think
it
over
the
more
i
convinced
that
he
took
it
you
know
we
all
went
to
the
back
field
to
look
at
the
jerseys
and
all
that
time
the
coat
was
hanging
there
in
the
hall
and
not
a
soul
in
the
house
and
it
was
just
after
we
came
back
that
i
saw
ned
scuttling
down
the
lane
so
fast
i
mentioned
my
suspicions
to
the
carrolls
a
few
days
afterwards
when
i
went
down
with
the
photographs
and
found
that
they
had
discovered
no
trace
of
the
lost
pocketbook
but
they
seemed
positively
angry
when
i
hinted
that
ned
brooke
might
know
more
about
its
whereabouts
than
anyone
else
they
declared
that
they
would
as
soon
think
of
suspecting
one
of
themselves
as
ned
and
altogether
they
seemed
so
offended
at
my
suggestion
that
i
held
my
peace
and
did
irritate
them
by
any
more
suppositions
afterwards
in
the
excitement
of
our
cousins
visit
the
matter
passed
out
of
my
mind
completely
they
stayed
two
weeks
and
i
was
so
busy
the
whole
time
that
i
never
got
a
chance
to
develop
that
third
plate
and
in
fact
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
one
morning
soon
after
they
went
away
i
remembered
the
plate
and
decided
to
go
and
develop
it
cecil
went
with
me
and
we
shut
ourselves
up
in
our
den
lit
our
ruby
lantern
and
began
operations
i
did
not
expect
much
of
the
plate
because
it
had
been
exposed
and
handled
carelessly
and
i
thought
that
it
might
prove
to
be
underexposed
or
so
i
left
cecil
to
develop
it
while
i
prepared
the
fixing
bath
cecil
was
whistling
away
when
suddenly
he
gave
a
tremendous
whew
of
astonishment
and
sprang
to
his
feet
amy
amy
look
here
he
cried
i
rushed
to
his
side
and
looked
at
the
plate
as
he
held
it
up
in
the
rosy
light
it
was
a
splendid
one
and
the
carroll
house
came
out
clear
with
the
front
door
and
the
steps
in
full
view
and
there
just
in
the
act
of
stepping
from
the
threshold
was
the
figure
of
a
boy
with
an
old
straw
hat
on
his
head
and
in
his
hand
the
pocketbook
he
was
standing
with
his
head
turned
towards
the
corner
of
the
house
as
if
listening
with
one
hand
holding
his
ragged
coat
open
and
the
other
poised
in
with
the
pocketbook
as
if
he
were
just
going
to
put
it
in
his
inside
pocket
the
whole
scene
was
as
clear
as
noonday
and
nobody
with
eyes
in
his
head
could
have
failed
to
recognize
ned
brooke
goodness
i
gasped
in
with
it
quick
and
we
doused
the
thing
into
the
fixing
bath
and
then
sat
down
breathlessly
and
looked
at
each
other
i
say
amy
said
cecil
what
a
sell
this
will
be
on
the
carrolls
ned
brooke
could
do
such
a
thing
oh
no
the
poor
injured
boy
at
whom
everyone
has
such
an
unlawful
pick
i
wonder
if
this
will
convince
them
do
you
think
they
can
get
it
all
back
i
asked
it
not
likely
he
would
have
dared
to
use
any
of
it
yet
i
do
know
we
have
a
try
anyhow
how
long
before
this
plate
will
be
dry
enough
to
carry
down
to
the
carrolls
as
circumstantial
evidence
three
hours
or
thereabouts
i
answered
but
perhaps
sooner
take
two
prints
off
when
it
is
ready
i
wonder
what
the
carrolls
will
say
it
a
piece
of
pure
luck
that
the
plate
should
have
turned
out
so
well
after
the
way
in
which
it
was
taken
and
used
i
say
amy
is
this
quite
an
adventure
at
last
the
plate
was
dry
and
i
printed
two
proofs
we
wrapped
them
up
carefully
and
marched
down
to
carroll
you
never
saw
people
so
overcome
with
astonishment
as
the
carrolls
were
when
cecil
with
the
air
of
a
statesman
unfolding
the
evidence
of
some
dreadful
conspiracy
against
the
peace
and
welfare
of
the
nation
produced
the
plate
and
the
proofs
and
held
them
out
before
them
carroll
and
cecil
took
the
proofs
and
went
over
to
the
brooke
shanty
they
found
only
ned
and
his
mother
at
home
at
first
ned
when
taxed
with
his
guilt
denied
it
but
when
carroll
confronted
him
with
the
proofs
he
broke
down
in
a
spasm
of
terror
and
confessed
all
his
mother
produced
the
pocketbook
and
the
money
they
had
not
dared
to
spend
a
single
cent
of
it
and
carroll
went
home
in
triumph
perhaps
ned
brooke
ought
not
to
have
been
let
off
so
easily
as
he
was
but
his
mother
cried
and
pleaded
and
carroll
was
too
to
resist
so
he
did
not
punish
them
at
all
save
by
utterly
discarding
the
whole
family
and
their
concerns
the
place
got
too
hot
for
them
after
the
story
came
out
and
in
less
than
a
month
all
moved
away
much
to
the
benefit
of
mapleton
in
spite
of
myself
my
trunk
was
packed
and
i
had
arranged
with
my
senior
partner
i
was
the
junior
member
of
a
law
firm
for
a
month
vacation
aunt
lucy
had
written
that
her
husband
had
gone
on
a
sea
trip
and
she
wished
me
to
superintend
the
business
of
his
farm
and
mills
in
his
absence
if
i
could
arrange
to
do
so
she
added
that
gussie
thought
it
was
a
pity
to
trouble
me
and
wanted
to
do
the
overseeing
herself
but
that
she
aunt
lucy
preferred
to
have
a
man
at
the
head
of
affairs
i
had
never
seen
my
augusta
ashley
but
i
knew
from
aunt
lucy
remarks
concerning
her
pretty
much
what
sort
of
person
she
was
just
the
precise
kind
i
disliked
immeasurably
i
had
no
idea
what
her
age
was
but
doubtless
she
was
over
thirty
tall
determined
aggressive
with
a
faculty
for
managing
a
sharp
probing
nose
and
a
between
her
eyebrows
i
knew
the
type
and
i
was
assured
that
the
period
of
sojourn
with
my
respected
aunt
would
be
one
of
strife
between
miss
ashley
and
myself
i
wrote
to
aunt
lucy
to
expect
me
made
all
necessary
arrangements
and
went
to
bid
nellie
goodbye
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
nellie
i
had
never
openly
avowed
myself
her
suitor
but
we
were
cousins
and
had
grown
up
together
so
that
i
knew
her
well
enough
to
be
sure
of
my
ground
i
liked
her
so
well
that
it
was
easy
to
persuade
myself
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
she
more
nearly
fulfilled
the
requirements
of
my
ideal
wife
than
anyone
i
knew
she
was
pleasant
to
look
upon
without
being
distractingly
pretty
small
and
fair
and
womanly
she
dressed
nicely
sang
and
played
agreeably
danced
well
and
had
a
cheerful
affectionate
disposition
she
was
not
alarmingly
clever
had
no
hobbies
and
looked
up
to
me
as
heir
to
all
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
what
man
does
not
like
to
be
thought
clever
and
brilliant
i
had
no
formidable
rival
and
our
families
were
anxious
for
the
match
i
considered
myself
a
lucky
fellow
i
felt
that
i
would
be
very
lonely
without
nellie
when
i
was
away
and
she
admitted
frankly
that
she
would
miss
me
awfully
she
looked
so
sweet
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
her
then
and
there
to
marry
me
well
fate
interfered
in
the
guise
of
a
small
brother
so
i
said
goodbye
and
left
mentally
comparing
her
to
my
idea
of
miss
augusta
ashley
much
to
the
disadvantage
when
i
stepped
from
the
train
at
a
sleepy
country
station
next
day
i
was
promptly
waylaid
by
a
urchin
who
informed
me
that
ashley
had
sent
him
with
an
express
wagon
for
my
luggage
and
that
miss
gussie
was
waiting
with
the
carriage
at
the
store
pointing
down
to
a
small
building
before
whose
door
a
girl
was
trying
to
soothe
her
frightened
horse
as
i
went
down
the
slope
towards
her
i
noticed
she
was
tall
quite
too
tall
for
my
taste
i
dislike
women
who
can
look
into
my
eyes
on
a
level
but
i
had
to
admit
that
her
form
was
remarkably
symmetrical
and
graceful
she
put
out
her
hand
it
was
ungloved
and
large
but
white
and
firm
with
a
cool
pleasant
touch
and
said
with
a
composure
akin
to
indifference
carslake
i
presume
mother
could
not
come
to
meet
you
so
she
sent
me
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
hold
my
horse
for
a
few
minutes
i
want
to
get
something
in
the
store
whereupon
she
calmly
transferred
the
reins
to
me
and
disappeared
at
the
time
she
certainly
did
not
impress
me
as
pretty
yet
neither
could
i
call
her
plain
taken
separately
her
features
were
good
her
nose
was
large
and
straight
the
mouth
also
a
trifle
large
but
firm
and
red
the
brow
wide
and
white
shadowed
by
a
straying
dash
of
brown
curl
or
two
she
had
a
certain
cool
statuesque
paleness
accentuated
by
straight
fine
black
brows
and
her
eyes
were
a
bluish
grey
but
the
pupils
as
i
afterward
found
out
had
a
trick
of
dilating
into
wells
of
blackness
which
added
to
a
long
fringe
of
very
dark
lashes
made
her
eyes
quite
the
most
striking
feature
of
her
face
her
expression
was
open
and
frank
and
her
voice
clear
and
musical
without
being
sweet
she
looked
about
at
the
time
i
did
not
fancy
her
appearance
and
made
a
mental
note
to
the
effect
that
i
would
never
like
miss
ashley
i
had
no
use
for
cool
businesslike
women
women
should
have
no
concern
with
business
nellie
would
never
have
troubled
her
dear
curly
head
over
it
miss
ashley
came
out
with
her
arms
full
of
packages
stowed
them
away
in
the
carriage
got
in
told
me
which
road
to
take
and
did
not
again
speak
till
we
were
out
of
the
village
and
driving
along
a
pretty
country
lane
arched
over
with
crimson
maples
and
beeches
the
purplish
haze
of
a
sunny
autumn
day
mellowed
over
the
fields
and
the
bunch
of
golden
rod
at
my
companion
belt
was
akin
to
the
plumed
ranks
along
the
fences
i
hazarded
the
remark
that
it
was
a
fine
day
miss
ashley
gravely
admitted
that
it
was
then
a
deep
smile
seemed
to
rise
somewhere
in
her
eyes
and
creep
over
her
face
discovering
a
dimple
here
and
there
as
it
proceeded
do
let
talk
about
the
weather
the
subject
is
rather
stale
she
said
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
why
on
earth
mother
had
to
drag
you
away
out
here
i
tried
to
show
her
how
foolish
it
was
but
i
succeed
mother
thinks
there
must
be
a
man
at
the
head
of
affairs
or
they
never
go
right
i
could
have
taken
full
charge
easily
enough
i
have
been
father
all
my
life
for
nothing
there
was
no
need
to
take
you
away
from
your
business
i
protested
i
said
i
was
going
to
take
a
vacation
anyway
and
business
was
not
pressing
just
then
i
also
hinted
that
while
i
had
no
doubt
of
her
capacity
she
might
have
found
the
duties
of
superintendent
rather
arduous
not
at
all
she
said
with
a
serenity
that
made
me
groan
inwardly
i
like
it
father
always
said
i
was
a
born
business
manager
find
ashley
mills
very
quiet
i
afraid
it
a
sort
of
charmed
sleepy
hollow
see
there
home
as
we
turned
a
corner
and
looked
from
the
crest
of
one
hill
across
to
that
of
another
home
was
a
big
white
house
buried
amid
a
riot
of
autumn
colour
with
a
big
grove
of
dark
green
spruces
at
the
back
below
them
was
a
glimpse
of
a
dark
blue
mill
pond
and
beyond
it
long
sweeps
of
meadow
land
sloping
up
till
they
dimmed
in
horizon
mists
of
pearl
and
purple
how
pretty
i
exclaimed
admiringly
is
it
said
gussie
proudly
i
love
it
her
pupils
dilated
into
dark
pools
and
i
rather
unwillingly
admitted
that
miss
ashley
was
a
girl
as
we
drove
up
aunt
lucy
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
verandah
over
whose
white
roof
trailed
a
luxuriant
creeper
its
leaves
tinged
by
october
frosts
into
lovely
wine
reds
and
tawny
yellows
gussie
sprang
out
barely
touching
my
offered
hand
with
her
fingertips
there
mother
waiting
to
pounce
on
you
and
hear
all
the
family
news
she
said
so
go
and
greet
her
like
a
dutiful
nephew
i
must
take
out
your
horse
for
you
first
i
said
politely
not
at
all
said
miss
ashley
taking
the
reins
from
my
hands
in
a
way
not
to
be
disputed
i
always
unharness
charley
myself
no
one
understands
him
half
so
well
besides
i
used
to
it
did
i
tell
you
i
always
been
father
boy
i
well
believe
it
i
thought
in
disgust
as
she
led
the
horse
over
to
the
well
and
i
went
up
to
aunt
lucy
through
the
windows
i
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
miss
ashley
as
she
watered
and
deftly
unharnessed
charley
and
led
him
into
his
stable
with
sundry
pats
on
his
nose
then
i
saw
no
more
of
her
till
she
came
in
to
tell
us
tea
was
ready
and
led
the
way
out
to
the
dining
room
it
was
evident
miss
gussie
held
the
reins
of
household
government
and
no
doubt
worthily
those
firm
capable
white
hands
of
hers
looked
as
though
they
might
be
equal
to
a
good
many
emergencies
she
talked
little
leaving
the
conversation
to
aunt
lucy
and
myself
though
she
occasionally
dropped
in
an
apt
word
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
however
she
caught
hold
of
an
unfortunate
opinion
i
had
incautiously
advanced
and
tore
it
into
tatters
the
result
was
a
spirited
argument
in
which
miss
gussie
held
her
own
with
such
ability
that
i
was
utterly
routed
and
found
another
grievance
against
her
it
was
very
humiliating
to
be
worsted
by
a
girl
a
country
girl
at
that
who
had
passed
most
of
her
life
on
a
farm
no
doubt
she
was
and
wanted
to
vote
i
was
quite
prepared
to
believe
anything
of
her
after
tea
miss
ashley
proposed
a
walk
around
the
premises
in
order
to
initiate
me
into
my
duties
apart
from
his
farm
ashley
owned
large
and
did
a
flourishing
business
with
the
details
of
which
miss
gussie
seemed
so
conversant
that
i
lost
all
doubt
of
her
ability
to
run
the
whole
thing
as
she
had
claimed
i
felt
quite
ignorant
in
the
light
of
her
superior
knowledge
and
our
walk
was
enlivened
by
some
rather
too
lively
discussions
between
us
we
walked
about
together
however
till
the
shadows
of
the
firs
by
the
mills
stretched
nearly
across
the
pond
and
the
white
moon
began
to
put
on
a
silvery
burnish
then
we
wound
up
by
a
bitter
dispute
during
which
gussie
eyes
were
very
black
and
each
cheek
had
a
round
red
stain
on
it
she
had
a
little
air
of
triumph
at
having
defeated
me
i
have
to
go
now
and
see
about
putting
away
the
milk
and
i
dare
say
you
not
sorry
to
be
rid
of
me
she
said
with
a
demureness
i
had
not
credited
her
with
but
if
you
come
to
the
verandah
in
half
an
hour
i
bring
you
out
a
glass
of
new
milk
and
some
pound
cake
i
made
today
by
a
recipe
that
been
in
the
family
for
one
hundred
years
and
i
hope
it
will
choke
you
for
all
the
snubs
you
been
giving
me
she
walked
away
after
this
amiable
wish
and
i
stood
by
the
pond
till
the
salmon
tints
faded
from
its
waters
and
stars
began
to
mirror
themselves
brokenly
in
its
ripples
the
mellow
air
was
full
of
sweet
mingled
eventide
sounds
as
i
walked
back
to
the
house
aunt
lucy
was
knitting
on
the
verandah
gussie
brought
out
cake
and
milk
and
chatted
to
us
while
we
ate
in
an
inconsequent
girlish
way
or
fed
bits
of
cake
to
a
goblin
in
the
likeness
of
a
black
cat
she
appeared
in
such
an
amiable
light
that
i
was
half
inclined
to
reconsider
my
opinion
of
her
when
i
went
to
my
room
the
vase
full
of
crimson
leaves
on
my
table
suggested
gussie
and
i
repented
of
my
unfriendliness
for
a
moment
and
only
for
a
moment
gussie
and
her
mother
passed
through
the
hall
below
and
aunt
lucy
soft
voice
floated
up
through
my
door
well
how
do
you
like
your
cousin
my
dear
whereat
that
decided
young
lady
promptly
answered
i
think
he
is
the
most
conceited
youth
i
met
for
some
time
pleasant
was
it
i
thought
of
nellie
meek
admiration
of
all
my
words
and
ways
and
got
her
photo
out
to
soothe
my
vanity
for
the
first
time
it
struck
me
that
her
features
were
somewhat
insipid
the
thought
seemed
like
disloyalty
so
i
banished
it
and
went
to
bed
i
expected
to
dream
of
that
disagreeable
gussie
but
i
did
not
and
i
slept
so
soundly
that
it
was
ten
the
next
morning
before
i
woke
i
sprang
out
of
bed
in
dismay
dressed
hastily
and
ran
down
not
a
little
provoked
at
myself
through
the
window
i
saw
gussie
in
the
garden
digging
up
some
geraniums
she
was
enveloped
in
a
brown
apron
a
big
flapping
straw
hat
half
hid
her
face
and
she
wore
a
pair
of
muddy
old
kid
gloves
her
whole
appearance
was
disreputable
and
the
face
she
turned
to
me
as
i
said
good
morning
had
a
diagonal
streak
of
clay
across
it
i
added
slovenliness
to
my
already
long
list
of
her
demerits
good
afternoon
rather
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
the
men
were
here
three
hours
ago
for
their
orders
i
thought
it
a
pity
to
disturb
your
peaceful
dreams
so
i
gave
them
myself
and
sent
them
off
i
was
angrier
than
ever
a
nice
beginning
i
had
made
and
was
that
girl
laughing
at
me
i
expected
to
be
called
in
time
certainly
i
said
stiffly
i
am
not
accustomed
to
oversleep
myself
i
promise
it
will
not
occur
again
my
dignity
was
quite
lost
on
gussie
she
peeled
off
her
gloves
cheerfully
and
said
i
suppose
you
like
some
breakfast
just
wait
till
i
wash
my
hands
and
i
get
you
some
then
if
you
pining
to
be
useful
you
can
help
me
take
up
these
geraniums
there
was
no
help
for
it
after
i
had
breakfasted
i
went
with
many
misgivings
we
got
on
fairly
well
however
gussie
was
particularly
lively
and
kept
me
too
busy
for
argument
i
quite
enjoyed
the
time
and
we
did
not
quarrel
until
nearly
the
last
when
we
fell
out
bitterly
over
some
horticultural
problem
and
went
in
to
dinner
in
sulky
silence
gussie
disappeared
after
dinner
and
i
saw
no
more
of
her
i
was
glad
of
this
but
after
a
time
i
began
to
find
it
a
little
dull
even
a
dispute
would
have
been
livelier
i
visited
the
mills
looked
over
the
farm
and
then
carelessly
asked
aunt
lucy
where
miss
ashley
was
aunt
lucy
replied
that
she
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
and
would
not
be
back
till
the
next
day
this
was
satisfactory
of
course
highly
so
what
a
relief
it
was
to
be
rid
of
that
girl
with
her
and
independence
i
said
to
myself
that
i
hoped
her
friend
would
keep
her
for
a
week
i
forgot
to
be
disappointed
that
she
had
not
when
next
afternoon
i
saw
gussie
coming
in
at
the
gate
with
a
tolerably
large
satchel
and
an
armful
of
golden
rod
i
sauntered
down
to
relieve
her
and
we
had
a
sharp
argument
under
way
before
we
were
halfway
up
the
lane
as
usual
gussie
refused
to
give
in
that
she
was
wrong
her
walk
had
brought
a
faint
clear
tint
to
her
cheeks
and
her
rippling
dusky
hair
had
half
slipped
down
on
her
neck
she
said
she
had
to
make
some
cookies
for
tea
and
if
i
had
nothing
better
to
do
i
might
go
and
talk
to
her
while
she
mixed
them
it
was
not
a
gracious
invitation
but
i
went
rather
than
be
left
to
my
own
company
by
the
end
of
the
week
i
was
as
much
at
home
at
ashley
mills
as
if
i
had
lived
there
all
my
life
gussie
and
i
were
thrown
together
a
good
deal
for
lack
of
other
companions
and
i
saw
no
reason
to
change
my
opinion
of
her
she
could
be
lively
and
entertaining
when
she
chose
and
at
times
she
might
be
called
beautiful
still
i
did
not
approve
of
her
at
least
i
thought
so
most
of
the
time
once
in
a
while
came
a
state
of
feeling
which
i
did
not
quite
understand
one
evening
i
went
to
prayer
meeting
with
aunt
lucy
and
gussie
i
had
not
seen
the
minister
of
ashley
mills
before
though
gussie
and
her
mother
seemed
to
know
him
intimately
i
had
an
idea
that
he
was
old
and
and
so
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
him
as
young
as
myself
a
tall
pale
man
with
a
high
white
brow
and
dark
earnest
eyes
decidedly
attractive
i
was
still
more
surprised
when
after
the
service
he
joined
gussie
at
the
door
and
went
down
the
steps
with
her
i
felt
distinctly
as
i
fell
back
with
aunt
lucy
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
none
it
ought
to
have
been
a
relief
rev
carroll
martin
had
every
right
to
see
miss
ashley
home
if
he
chose
doubtless
a
girl
who
knew
all
there
was
to
be
known
about
business
farming
and
milling
to
say
nothing
of
housekeeping
and
gardening
could
discuss
theology
also
it
was
none
of
my
business
i
do
know
what
kept
me
awake
so
late
that
night
as
a
consequence
i
overslept
myself
i
had
managed
to
redeem
my
reputation
on
this
point
but
here
it
was
lost
again
i
felt
cross
and
foolish
and
cantankerous
when
i
went
out
there
was
some
unusual
commotion
at
the
well
it
was
an
open
one
with
a
chain
and
windlass
aunt
lucy
was
peering
anxiously
down
its
mouth
from
which
a
ladder
was
sticking
just
as
i
got
there
gussie
emerged
from
its
depths
with
a
triumphant
face
her
skirt
was
muddy
and
draggled
her
hair
had
tumbled
down
and
she
held
a
dripping
black
cat
coco
must
have
fallen
into
the
well
last
night
she
explained
as
i
helped
her
to
the
ground
i
missed
him
at
and
when
i
came
to
the
well
this
morning
i
heard
the
most
yowls
coming
up
from
it
i
could
think
where
he
could
possibly
be
for
the
water
was
quite
calm
until
i
saw
he
had
crept
into
a
little
crevice
in
the
stones
on
the
side
so
i
got
a
ladder
and
went
down
after
him
you
should
have
called
me
i
said
sourly
you
might
have
killed
yourself
going
down
there
and
coco
might
have
tumbled
in
and
drowned
while
you
were
getting
up
retorted
gussie
besides
what
was
the
need
i
could
go
down
as
well
as
you
no
doubt
i
said
more
sharply
than
i
had
any
business
to
i
dream
of
disputing
your
ability
to
do
anything
you
may
take
it
into
your
head
to
do
most
young
ladies
are
not
in
the
habit
of
going
down
wells
however
perhaps
not
she
rejoined
with
freezing
calmness
but
as
you
may
have
discovered
i
am
not
young
ladies
i
am
myself
augusta
ashley
and
accountable
to
nobody
but
myself
if
i
choose
to
go
down
the
well
every
day
for
pure
love
of
it
she
walked
off
in
her
wet
dress
with
her
muddy
cat
gussie
ashley
was
the
only
girl
i
ever
saw
who
could
be
dignified
under
such
circumstances
i
was
in
a
very
bad
humour
with
myself
as
i
went
off
to
see
about
having
the
well
cleaned
out
i
had
offended
gussie
and
i
knew
she
would
not
be
easily
appeased
nor
was
she
for
a
week
she
kept
me
politely
studiously
at
a
distance
in
spite
of
my
most
humble
advances
rev
carroll
was
a
frequent
caller
ostensibly
to
make
arrangements
about
a
sunday
school
they
were
organizing
in
a
poor
part
of
the
community
gussie
and
he
held
long
conversations
on
this
enthralling
subject
then
gussie
went
on
another
visit
to
her
friend
and
when
she
came
back
so
did
rev
carroll
one
calm
hazy
afternoon
i
was
coming
slowly
up
from
the
mills
happening
to
glance
at
the
kitchen
roof
i
gasped
it
was
on
fire
in
one
place
evidently
the
dry
shingles
had
caught
fire
from
a
spark
there
was
not
a
soul
about
save
gussie
aunt
lucy
and
myself
i
dashed
wildly
into
the
kitchen
where
gussie
was
peeling
apples
the
house
is
on
fire
i
exclaimed
gussie
dropped
her
knife
and
turned
pale
do
wake
mother
was
all
she
said
as
she
snatched
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
table
the
ladder
was
still
lying
by
the
well
in
a
second
i
had
raised
it
to
the
roof
and
while
gussie
went
up
it
like
a
squirrel
and
dashed
the
water
on
the
flames
i
had
two
more
buckets
ready
for
her
fortunately
the
fire
had
made
little
headway
though
a
few
minutes
more
would
have
given
it
a
dangerous
start
the
flames
hissed
and
died
out
as
gussie
threw
on
the
water
and
in
a
few
seconds
only
a
small
black
hole
in
the
shingles
remained
gussie
slid
down
the
ladder
she
trembled
in
every
limb
but
she
put
out
her
wet
hand
to
me
with
a
faint
triumphant
smile
we
shook
hands
across
the
ladder
with
a
cordiality
never
before
expressed
for
the
next
week
in
spite
of
rev
carroll
i
was
happy
when
i
thought
of
gussie
and
miserable
when
i
thought
of
nellie
i
held
myself
in
some
way
bound
to
her
and
was
she
not
my
ideal
undoubtedly
one
day
i
got
a
letter
from
my
sister
it
was
long
and
newsy
and
the
eighth
page
was
most
interesting
if
you
do
come
home
and
look
after
nellie
wrote
kate
soon
not
have
her
to
look
after
you
remember
that
old
lover
of
hers
rod
allen
well
he
home
from
the
west
now
immensely
rich
they
say
and
his
attentions
to
nellie
are
the
town
talk
i
think
she
likes
him
too
if
you
bury
yourself
any
longer
at
ashley
mills
i
wo
be
responsible
for
the
consequences
this
lifted
an
immense
weight
from
my
mind
but
the
ninth
page
hurled
it
back
again
you
never
say
anything
of
miss
ashley
in
your
letters
what
is
she
like
young
or
old
ugly
or
pretty
clever
or
dull
i
met
a
lady
recently
who
knows
her
and
thinks
she
is
charming
she
also
said
miss
ashley
was
to
be
married
soon
to
rev
is
it
true
aye
was
it
quite
likely
kate
letter
made
a
very
miserable
man
of
me
gussie
found
me
a
dull
companion
that
day
after
several
vain
attempts
to
rouse
me
to
interest
she
gave
it
up
there
no
use
talking
to
you
she
said
impatiently
i
believe
you
are
homesick
that
letter
you
got
this
morning
looked
suspicious
anyhow
i
hope
you
get
over
it
before
i
get
back
are
you
going
away
again
i
asked
yes
i
am
going
to
stay
a
few
days
with
flossie
flossie
was
that
inseparable
chum
of
hers
you
seem
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
your
time
with
her
i
remarked
discontentedly
gussie
opened
her
eyes
at
my
tone
why
of
course
she
said
flossie
and
i
have
always
been
chums
and
she
needs
me
more
than
ever

now
for
she

awfully
busy

other
there
he

to
drive

over
and
i
not
ready

to
him
for
pity
sake
while
i

and

i
never
enjoyed
a
conversation
more
rev
carroll
martin
was
a
remarkably
interesting
man
nellie
married
rod
allen
at
christmas
and
i
was
best
man
nellie
made
a
charming
little
bride
and
rod
fairly
worshipped
her
my
own
wedding
did
not
come
off
until
spring
as
gussie
said
she
could
not
get
ready
before
that
kismet
the
fifth
heat
in
the
was
just
over
had
won
and
the
crowd
on
the
grand
stand
and
the
around
the
track
were
cheering
themselves
hoarse
clear
through
the
noisy
clamour
shrilled
a
woman
cry
ah
i
have
dropped
my
scorecard
a
man
in
front
of
her
turned
i
have
an
extra
one
madame
will
you
accept
it
her
small
hand
closed
eagerly
on
it
before
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
both
started
convulsively
the
man
turned
very
pale
but
the
woman
face
coloured
darkly
you
she
faltered
his
lips
parted
in
the
smile
she
remembered
and
hated
you
are
not
glad
to
see
me
he
said
calmly
but
that
i
suppose
was
not
to
be
expected
i
did
not
come
here
to
annoy
you
this
meeting
is
as
unexpected
to
me
as
to
you
i
had
no
suspicion
that
for
the
last
i
had
been
standing
next
to
my
she
interrupted
him
by
an
imperious
gesture
still
clutching
the
scorecard
she
from
him
again
he
smiled
this
time
with
a
tinge
of
scorn
and
shifted
his
eyes
to
the
track
none
of
the
people
around
them
had
noticed
the
little
all
eyes
were
on
the
track
which
was
being
cleared
for
the
first
heat
of
another
race
the
horses
were
being
led
away
blanketed
the
crowd
cheered
as
she
went
past
a
shapeless
oddity
the
backers
of
mascot
the
rival
favourite
looked
gloomy
the
woman
noticed
nothing
of
all
this
she
was
small
very
pretty
still
young
and
gowned
in
a
quite
unmistakable
way
she
studied
the
man
profile
furtively
he
looked
older
than
when
she
had
seen
him
last
there
were
some
silver
threads
gleaming
in
his
dark
hair
and
short
pointed
beard
otherwise
there
was
little
change
in
the
quiet
features
and
somewhat
stern
grey
eyes
she
wondered
if
he
had
cared
at
all
they
had
not
met
for
five
years
she
shut
her
eyes
and
looked
in
on
her
past
it
all
came
back
very
vividly
she
had
been
eighteen
when
they
were
married
a
gay
girl
and
the
season
beauty
he
was
much
older
and
a
quiet
serious
student
her
friends
had
wondered
why
she
married
him
sometimes
she
wondered
herself
but
she
had
loved
him
or
thought
so
the
marriage
had
been
an
unhappy
one
she
was
fond
of
society
and
gaiety
he
wanted
quiet
and
seclusion
she
was
impulsive
and
impatient
he
deliberate
and
grave
the
strong
wills
clashed
after
two
years
of
an
unbearable
sort
of
life
they
had
separated
quietly
and
without
scandal
of
any
sort
she
had
wanted
a
divorce
but
he
would
not
agree
to
that
so
she
had
taken
her
own
independent
fortune
and
gone
back
to
her
own
way
of
life
in
the
following
five
years
she
had
succeeded
in
burying
all
remembrance
well
out
of
sight
no
one
knew
if
she
were
satisfied
or
not
her
world
was
charitable
to
her
and
she
lived
a
gay
and
quite
irreproachable
life
she
wished
that
she
had
not
come
to
the
races
it
was
such
an
irritating
encounter
she
opened
her
eyes
wearily
the
dusty
track
the
flying
horses
the
gay
dresses
of
the
women
on
the
grandstand
the
cloudless
blue
sky
the
brilliant
september
sunshine
the
purple
distances
all
commingled
in
a
glare
that
made
her
head
ache
before
it
all
she
saw
the
tall
figure
by
her
side
his
face
turned
from
her
watching
the
track
intently
she
wondered
with
a
vague
curiosity
what
induced
him
to
come
to
the
races
such
things
were
not
greatly
in
his
line
evidently
their
chance
meeting
had
not
disturbed
him
it
was
a
sign
that
he
did
not
care
she
sighed
a
little
wearily
and
closed
her
eyes
when
the
heat
was
over
he
turned
to
her
may
i
ask
how
you
have
been
since
since
we
met
last
you
are
looking
extremely
well
has
vanity
fair
palled
in
any
degree
she
was
angry
at
herself
and
him
where
had
her
careless
society
manner
and
composure
gone
she
felt
weak
and
hysterical
what
if
she
should
burst
into
tears
before
the
whole
crowd
before
those
coldly
critical
grey
eyes
she
almost
hated
him
no
why
should
it
i
have
found
it
very
pleasant
and
i
have
been
well
very
well
and
you
he
jotted
down
the
score
carefully
before
he
replied
i
oh
a
and
recluse
always
leads
a
placid
life
i
never
cared
for
excitement
you
know
i
came
down
here
to
attend
a
sale
of
some
rare
editions
and
a
friend
dragged
me
out
to
see
the
races
i
find
it
rather
interesting
i
must
confess
much
more
so
than
i
should
have
fancied
sorry
i
ca
stay
until
the
end
i
must
go
as
soon
as
the
is
over
if
not
before
i
have
backed
you
she
answered
quickly
it
almost
seemed
defiantly
how
horribly
unreal
it
was
this
carrying
on
of
small
talk
as
if
they
were
the
merest
of
acquaintances
she
belongs
to
a
friend
of
mine
so
i
am
naturally
interested
she
and
are
ties
now
both
have
won
two
heats
one
more
for
either
will
decide
it
this
is
a
good
day
for
the
races
excuse
me
he
leaned
over
and
brushed
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
grey
cloak
she
shivered
slightly
you
are
cold
this
stand
is
draughty
i
am
not
at
all
cold
thank
you
what
race
is
this
oh
the
one
she
bent
forward
with
assumed
interest
to
watch
the
scoring
she
was
breathing
heavily
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
she
bit
her
lips
savagely
and
glared
at
the
track
until
they
were
gone
presently
he
spoke
again
in
the
low
even
tone
demanded
by
circumstances
this
is
a
curious
meeting
is
it
not
quite
a
flavor
of
romance
do
you
read
as
many
novels
as
ever
she
fancied
there
was
mockery
in
his
tone
she
remembered
how
very
frivolous
he
used
to
consider
her
besides
she
resented
the
personal
tinge
what
right
had
he
almost
as
many
she
answered
carelessly
i
was
very
intolerant
was
i
he
said
after
a
pause
you
thought
so
you
were
right
you
have
been
happier
since
you
left
me
yes
she
said
defiantly
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
and
you
do
not
regret
it
he
bent
down
a
little
his
sleeve
brushed
against
her
shoulder
something
in
his
face
arrested
the
answer
she
meant
to
make
i
i
did
not
say
that
she
murmured
faintly
there
was
a
burst
of
cheering
the
horses
were
being
brought
out
for
the
sixth
heat
she
turned
away
to
watch
them
the
scoring
began
and
seemed
likely
to
have
no
end
she
was
tired
of
it
all
it
did
matter
a
pin
to
her
whether
or
mascot
won
what
matter
had
vanity
fair
after
all
been
a
satisfying
exchange
for
love
he
loved
her
once
and
they
had
been
happy
at
first
she
had
never
before
said
even
in
her
own
heart
i
am
sorry
but
suddenly
she
felt
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
looked
up
their
eyes
met
he
stooped
and
said
almost
in
a
whisper
will
you
come
back
to
me
i
do
know
she
whispered
breathlessly
as
one
we
were
both
to
blame
but
i
the
most
i
was
too
hard
on
you
i
ought
to
have
made
more
allowance
we
are
wiser
now
both
of
us
come
back
to
me
my
wife
his
tone
was
cold
and
his
face
expressionless
it
was
on
her
lips
to
cry
out
no
passionately
but
the
slender
scholarly
hand
on
her
shoulder
was
trembling
with
the
intensity
of
his
repressed
emotion
he
care
then
a
wild
caprice
flashed
into
her
brain
she
sprang
up
see
she
cried
they
off
now
this
heat
will
probably
decide
the
race
if
wins
i
will
not
go
back
to
you
if
does
i
will
that
is
my
decision
he
turned
paler
but
bowed
in
assent
he
knew
by
bitter
experience
how
unchangeable
her
whims
were
how
obstinately
she
clung
to
even
the
most
absurd
she
leaned
forward
breathlessly
the
crowd
hung
silently
on
the
track
and
mascot
were
neck
and
neck
getting
in
splendid
work
round
the
course
forged
half
a
neck
ahead
and
her
backers
went
mad
but
one
woman
dropped
her
head
in
her
hands
and
dared
look
no
more
one
man
with
white
face
and
set
lips
watched
the
track
unswervingly
again
mascot
crawled
up
inch
by
inch
they
were
on
the
home
stretch
they
were
equal
the
cheering
broke
out
then
silence
then
another
terrific
burst
shouts
yells
and
clappings
mascot
had
won
the
in
the
front
row
a
woman
stood
up
swayed
and
shaken
as
a
leaf
in
the
wind
she
straightened
her
scarlet
hat
and
readjusted
her
veil
unsteadily
there
was
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
tears
in
her
eyes
no
one
noticed
her
a
man
beside
her
drew
her
hand
through
his
arm
in
a
quiet
proprietary
fashion
they
left
the
grand
stand
together
lilian
business
venture
lilian
mitchell
turned
into
the
store
on
randall
street
just
as
esther
miller
and
ella
taylor
came
out
they
responded
coldly
to
her
greeting
and
exchanged
significant
glances
as
they
walked
away
lilian
pale
face
crimsoned
she
was
a
tall
slender
girl
of
about
seventeen
and
dressed
in
mourning
these
girls
had
been
her
close
friends
once
but
that
was
before
the
mitchells
had
lost
their
money
since
then
lilian
had
been
cut
by
many
of
her
old
chums
and
she
felt
it
keenly
the
clerks
in
the
store
were
busy
and
lilian
sat
down
to
wait
her
turn
near
to
her
two
ladies
were
also
waiting
and
chatting
helen
wants
me
to
let
her
have
a
birthday
party
saunders
was
saying
wearily
she
has
been
promised
it
so
long
and
i
hate
to
disappoint
the
child
but
our
girl
left
last
week
and
i
can
not
possibly
make
all
the
cakes
and
things
myself
i
have
the
time
or
strength
so
helen
must
do
without
her
party
talking
of
girls
said
reeves
impatiently
i
am
almost
discouraged
it
is
so
hard
to
get
a
good
one
the
last
one
i
had
was
so
saucy
i
had
to
discharge
her
and
the
one
i
have
now
can
not
make
decent
bread
i
never
had
good
luck
with
bread
myself
either
that
is
porter
great
grievance
too
it
is
no
light
task
to
bake
bread
for
all
those
boarders
have
you
made
your
jelly
yet
no
maria
can
not
make
it
she
says
and
i
detest
messing
with
jelly
but
i
really
must
see
to
it
soon
at
this
point
a
saleswoman
came
up
to
lilian
who
made
her
small
purchases
and
went
out
there
goes
lilian
mitchell
said
reeves
in
an
undertone
she
looks
very
pale
they
say
they
are
dreadfully
poor
since
henry
mitchell
died
his
affairs
were
in
a
bad
condition
i
am
told
i
am
sorry
for
mitchell
responded
saunders
she
is
such
a
sweet
woman
lilian
will
have
to
do
something
i
suppose
and
there
is
so
little
chance
for
a
girl
here
lilian
walking
down
the
street
was
wearily
turning
over
in
her
mind
the
problems
of
her
young
existence
her
father
had
died
the
preceding
spring
he
had
been
a
supposedly
prosperous
merchant
the
mitchells
had
always
lived
well
and
lilian
was
a
petted
and
only
child
then
came
the
shock
of
henry
mitchell
sudden
death
and
of
financial
ruin
his
affairs
were
found
to
be
hopelessly
involved
when
all
the
debts
were
paid
there
was
left
only
the
merest
pittance
barely
enough
for
for
lilian
and
her
mother
to
live
upon
they
had
moved
into
a
tiny
cottage
in
an
unfashionable
locality
and
during
the
summer
lilian
had
tried
hard
to
think
of
something
to
do
mitchell
was
a
delicate
woman
and
the
burden
of
their
situation
fell
on
lilian
young
shoulders
there
seemed
to
be
no
place
for
her
she
could
not
teach
and
had
no
particular
talent
in
any
line
there
was
no
opening
for
her
in
willington
which
was
a
rather
sleepy
little
place
and
lilian
was
almost
in
despair
there
really
does
seem
to
be
any
real
place
in
the
world
for
me
mother
she
said
rather
dolefully
at
the
supper
table
i
no
talent
at
all
it
is
dreadful
to
have
been
born
without
one
and
yet
i
do
something
and
do
it
soon
and
lilian
after
she
had
washed
up
the
tea
dishes
went
upstairs
and
had
a
good
cry
but
the
darkest
hour
so
the
proverb
goes
is
just
before
the
dawn
and
after
lilian
had
had
her
cry
out
and
was
sitting
at
her
window
in
the
dusk
watching
a
thin
new
moon
shining
over
the
trees
down
the
street
her
inspiration
came
to
her
a
minute
later
she
whirled
into
the
tiny
where
her
mother
was
sewing
mother
our
fortune
is
made
i
have
an
idea
do
lose
it
then
said
mitchell
with
a
smile
what
is
it
my
dear
lilian
sobered
herself
sat
down
by
her
mother
side
and
proceeded
to
recount
the
conversation
she
had
heard
in
the
store
that
afternoon
now
mother
this
is
where
my
brilliant
idea
comes
in
you
have
often
told
me
i
am
a
born
cook
and
i
always
have
good
luck
now
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
go
to
saunders
and
offer
to
furnish
all
the
good
things
for
helen
birthday
party
and
then
i
ask
reeves
and
porter
if
i
may
make
their
bread
for
them
that
will
do
for
a
beginning
i
like
cooking
you
know
and
i
believe
that
in
time
i
can
work
up
a
good
business
it
seems
to
be
a
good
idea
said
mitchell
thoughtfully
and
i
am
willing
that
you
should
try
but
have
you
thought
it
all
out
carefully
there
will
be
many
difficulties
i
know
i
do
expect
smooth
sailing
right
along
and
perhaps
fail
altogether
but
somehow
i
do
believe
i
will
a
great
many
of
your
old
friends
will
think
oh
yes
i
know
too
but
i
am
not
going
to
mind
it
mother
i
do
think
there
is
any
disgrace
in
working
for
my
living
i
going
to
do
my
best
and
not
care
what
people
say
early
next
morning
lilian
started
out
she
had
carefully
thought
over
the
details
of
her
small
venture
considered
ways
and
means
and
decided
on
the
most
advisable
course
she
would
not
attempt
too
much
and
she
felt
sure
of
success
to
secure
competent
servants
was
one
of
the
problems
of
willington
people
at
drayton
a
large
neighbouring
town
were
several
factories
and
into
these
all
the
working
girls
from
willington
had
crowded
leaving
very
few
who
were
willing
to
go
out
to
service
many
of
those
who
did
were
poor
cooks
and
lilian
shrewdly
suspected
that
many
a
harassed
housekeeper
in
the
village
would
be
glad
to
avail
herself
of
the
new
enterprise
lilian
was
as
she
had
said
of
herself
a
born
cook
this
was
her
capital
and
she
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
saunders
listened
to
her
businesslike
details
with
surprise
and
delight
it
is
the
very
thing
she
said
helen
is
so
eager
for
that
party
but
i
could
not
undertake
it
myself
her
birthday
is
friday
can
you
have
everything
ready
by
then
yes
i
think
so
said
lilian
briskly
producing
her
notebook
please
give
me
the
list
of
what
you
want
and
i
will
do
my
best
from
saunders
she
went
to
reeves
and
found
a
customer
as
soon
as
she
had
told
the
reason
of
her
call
i
furnish
all
the
bread
and
rolls
you
need
she
said
and
they
will
be
good
too
now
about
your
jelly
i
can
make
good
jelly
and
i
be
very
glad
to
make
yours
when
she
left
lilian
had
an
order
for
two
dozen
glasses
of
apple
jelly
as
well
as
a
standing
one
for
bread
and
rolls
porter
was
next
visited
and
grasped
eagerly
at
the
opportunity
i
know
your
bread
will
be
good
she
said
and
you
may
count
on
me
as
a
regular
customer
lilian
thought
she
had
enough
on
hand
for
a
first
attempt
and
went
home
satisfied
on
her
way
she
called
at
the
grocery
store
with
an
order
that
surprised
hooper
when
she
told
him
of
her
plan
he
opened
his
eyes
i
must
tell
my
wife
about
that
she
is
strong
and
she
does
like
cooking
after
dinner
lilian
went
to
work
enveloped
in
a
big
apron
and
whipped
eggs
stoned
raisins
stirred
concocted
and
baked
until
dark
when
bedtime
came
she
was
so
tired
that
she
could
hardly
crawl
upstairs
but
she
felt
happy
too
for
the
day
had
been
a
successful
one
and
so
also
were
the
days
and
weeks
and
months
that
followed
it
was
hard
and
constant
work
but
it
brought
its
reward
lilian
had
not
promised
more
than
she
could
perform
and
her
customers
were
satisfied
in
a
short
time
she
found
herself
with
a
regular
and
growing
business
on
her
hands
for
new
customers
were
gradually
added
and
always
came
to
stay
people
who
gave
parties
found
it
very
convenient
to
follow
saunders
example
and
order
their
supplies
from
lilian
she
had
a
very
busy
winter
and
of
course
it
was
not
all
plain
sailing
she
had
many
difficulties
to
contend
with
sometimes
days
came
on
which
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
when
the
stove
smoked
or
the
oven
would
heat
properly
when
cakes
fell
flat
and
bread
was
sour
and
pies
behaved
as
only
totally
depraved
pies
can
when
she
burned
her
fingers
and
felt
like
giving
up
in
despair
then
again
she
found
herself
cut
by
several
of
her
old
acquaintances
but
she
was
too
sensible
to
worry
much
over
this
the
friends
really
worth
having
were
still
hers
her
mother
face
had
lost
its
look
of
care
and
her
business
was
prospering
she
was
hopeful
and
wide
awake
kept
her
wits
about
her
and
looked
out
for
hints
and
learned
to
laugh
over
her
failures
during
the
winter
she
and
her
mother
had
managed
to
do
most
of
the
work
themselves
hiring
little
mary
robinson
next
door
on
especially
busy
days
and
now
and
then
calling
in
the
assistance
of
jimmy
bowen
and
his
hand
sled
to
carry
orders
to
customers
but
when
spring
came
lilian
prepared
to
open
up
her
summer
campaign
on
a
much
larger
scale
mary
robinson
was
hired
for
the
season
and
john
perkins
was
engaged
to
act
as
carrier
with
his
express
wagon
a
summer
kitchen
was
boarded
in
in
the
backyard
and
a
new
range
bought
lilian
began
operations
with
a
striking
advertisement
in
the
willington
and
an
attractive
circular
sent
around
to
all
her
patrons
picnics
and
summer
weddings
were
frequent
in
bread
and
rolls
her
trade
was
brisk
and
constant
she
also
took
orders
for
pickles
preserves
and
jellies
and
this
became
such
a
flourishing
branch
that
a
second
assistant
had
to
be
hired
it
was
a
cardinal
rule
with
lilian
never
to
send
out
any
article
that
was
not
up
to
her
standard
she
bore
the
loss
of
her
failures
and
sometimes
stayed
up
half
of
the
night
to
fill
an
order
on
time
prompt
and
perfect
was
her
motto
the
long
hot
summer
days
were
very
trying
and
sometimes
she
got
very
tired
of
it
all
but
when
on
the
anniversary
of
her
first
venture
she
made
up
her
accounts
she
was
well
pleased
to
be
sure
she
had
not
made
a
fortune
but
she
had
paid
all
their
expenses
had
a
hundred
dollars
clear
and
had
laid
the
solid
foundations
of
a
profitable
business
mother
she
said
jubilantly
as
she
wiped
a
dab
of
flour
from
her
nose
and
proceeded
to
concoct
the
icing
for
blanche
wedding
cake
do
you
think
my
business
venture
has
been
a
decided
success
mitchell
surveyed
her
busy
daughter
with
a
motherly
smile
yes
i
think
it
has
she
said
miriam
lover
i
had
been
reading
a
ghost
story
to
sefton
and
i
laid
it
down
at
the
end
with
a
little
shrug
of
contempt
what
utter
nonsense
i
said
sefton
nodded
abstractedly
above
her
fancywork
that
is
it
is
a
very
commonplace
story
indeed
i
do
believe
the
spirits
of
the
departed
trouble
themselves
to
revisit
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
honest
mortals
or
even
for
the
sake
of
hanging
around
the
favourite
haunts
of
their
existence
in
the
flesh
if
they
ever
appear
it
must
be
for
a
better
reason
than
that
you
do
surely
think
that
they
ever
do
appear
i
said
incredulously
we
have
no
proof
that
they
do
not
my
dear
surely
mary
i
exclaimed
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
believe
people
ever
do
or
can
see
spirits
ghosts
as
the
word
goes
i
did
say
i
believed
it
i
never
saw
anything
of
the
sort
i
neither
believe
nor
disbelieve
but
you
know
queer
things
do
happen
at
times
things
you
ca
account
for
at
least
people
who
you
know
would
lie
say
so
of
course
they
may
be
mistaken
and
i
think
that
everybody
can
see
spirits
either
provided
they
are
to
be
seen
it
requires
people
of
a
certain
organization
with
a
spiritual
eye
as
it
were
we
have
all
got
that
in
fact
i
think
very
few
of
us
have
i
dare
say
you
think
i
talking
nonsense
well
yes
i
think
you
are
you
really
surprise
me
mary
i
always
thought
you
the
least
likely
person
in
the
world
to
take
up
with
such
ideas
something
must
have
come
under
your
observation
to
develop
such
theories
in
your
practical
head
tell
me
what
it
was
to
what
purpose
you
would
remain
as
sceptical
as
ever
possibly
not
try
me
i
may
be
convinced
no
returned
sefton
calmly
nobody
ever
is
convinced
by
hearsay
when
a
person
has
once
seen
a
spirit
or
thinks
he
has
he
thenceforth
believes
it
and
when
somebody
else
is
intimately
associated
with
that
person
and
knows
all
the
circumstances
well
he
admits
the
possibility
at
least
that
is
my
position
but
by
the
time
it
gets
to
the
third
person
the
outsider
it
loses
power
besides
in
this
particular
instance
the
story
is
very
exciting
but
then
true
you
have
excited
my
curiosity
you
must
tell
me
the
story
well
first
tell
me
what
you
think
of
this
suppose
two
people
both
sensitively
organized
individuals
loved
each
other
with
a
love
stronger
than
life
if
they
were
apart
do
you
think
it
might
be
possible
for
their
souls
to
communicate
with
each
other
in
some
inexplicable
way
and
if
anything
happened
to
one
do
you
think
that
that
one
could
and
would
let
the
spirit
of
the
other
know
you
getting
into
too
deep
waters
for
me
mary
i
said
shaking
my
head
i
not
an
authority
on
telepathy
or
whatever
you
call
it
but
i
no
belief
in
such
theories
in
fact
i
think
they
are
all
nonsense
i
sure
you
must
think
so
too
in
your
rational
moments
i
dare
say
it
is
all
nonsense
said
sefton
slowly
but
if
you
had
lived
a
whole
year
in
the
same
house
with
miriam
gordon
you
would
have
been
tainted
too
not
that
she
had
at
least
she
never
aired
them
if
she
had
but
there
was
simply
something
about
the
girl
herself
that
gave
a
person
strange
impressions
when
i
first
met
her
i
had
the
most
uncanny
feeling
that
she
was
all
spirit
soul
what
you
will
no
flesh
anyhow
that
feeling
wore
off
after
a
while
but
she
never
seemed
like
other
people
to
me
she
was
sefton
niece
her
father
had
died
when
she
was
a
child
when
miriam
was
twenty
her
mother
had
married
a
second
time
and
went
to
europe
with
her
husband
miriam
came
to
live
with
us
while
they
were
away
upon
their
return
she
was
herself
to
be
married
i
had
never
seen
miriam
before
her
arrival
was
unexpected
and
i
was
absent
from
home
when
she
came
i
returned
in
the
evening
and
when
i
saw
her
first
she
was
standing
under
the
chandelier
in
the
drawing
room
talk
about
spirits
for
five
seconds
i
thought
i
had
seen
one
miriam
was
a
beauty
i
had
known
that
before
though
i
think
i
hardly
expected
to
see
such
wonderful
loveliness
she
was
tall
and
extremely
graceful
dark
at
least
her
hair
was
dark
but
her
skin
was
wonderfully
fair
and
clear
her
hair
was
gathered
away
from
her
face
and
she
had
a
high
pure
white
forehead
and
the
straightest
finest
blackest
brows
her
face
was
oval
with
very
large
and
dark
eyes
i
soon
realized
that
miriam
was
in
some
mysterious
fashion
different
from
other
people
i
think
everyone
who
met
her
felt
the
same
way
yet
it
was
a
feeling
hard
to
define
for
my
own
part
i
simply
felt
as
if
she
belonged
to
another
world
and
that
part
of
the
time
she
her
soul
you
know
was
back
there
again
you
must
not
suppose
that
miriam
was
a
disagreeable
person
to
have
in
the
house
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
very
reverse
everybody
liked
her
she
was
one
of
the
sweetest
most
winsome
girls
i
ever
knew
and
i
soon
grew
to
love
her
dearly
as
for
what
dick
called
her
queernesses
well
we
got
used
to
them
in
time
miriam
was
engaged
as
i
have
told
you
to
a
young
harvard
man
named
sidney
claxton
i
knew
she
loved
him
very
deeply
when
she
showed
me
his
photograph
i
liked
his
appearance
and
said
so
then
i
made
some
teasing
remark
about
her
just
for
a
joke
you
know
miriam
looked
at
me
with
an
odd
little
smile
and
said
quickly
and
i
never
write
to
each
other
miriam
i
exclaimed
in
astonishment
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
never
hear
from
him
at
all
i
did
not
say
that
i
hear
from
him
every
day
every
hour
we
do
not
need
to
write
letters
there
are
better
means
of
communication
between
two
souls
that
are
in
perfect
accord
with
each
other
you
uncanny
creature
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
but
miriam
only
gave
another
queer
smile
and
made
no
answer
at
all
whatever
her
beliefs
or
theories
were
she
would
never
discuss
them
she
had
a
habit
of
dropping
into
abstracted
reveries
at
any
time
or
place
no
matter
where
she
was
this
whatever
it
was
would
come
over
her
she
would
sit
there
perhaps
in
the
centre
of
a
gay
crowd
and
gaze
right
out
into
space
not
hearing
or
seeing
a
single
thing
that
went
on
around
her
i
remember
one
day
in
particular
we
were
sewing
in
my
room
i
looked
up
and
saw
that
miriam
work
had
dropped
on
her
knee
and
she
was
leaning
forward
her
lips
apart
her
eyes
gazing
upward
with
an
unearthly
expression
look
like
that
miriam
i
said
with
a
little
shiver
seem
to
be
looking
at
something
a
thousand
miles
away
miriam
came
out
of
her
trance
or
reverie
and
said
with
a
little
laugh
do
you
know
but
that
i
was
she
bent
her
head
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
lifted
it
again
and
looked
at
me
with
a
sudden
contraction
of
her
level
brows
that
betokened
vexation
wish
you
had
spoken
to
me
just
then
she
said
interrupted
the
message
i
was
receiving
i
shall
not
get
it
at
all
now
i
implored
so
wish
my
dear
girl
that
you
would
talk
so
it
makes
people
think
there
is
something
queer
about
you
who
in
the
world
was
sending
you
a
message
as
you
call
it
said
miriam
simply
think
it
is
nonsense
because
you
do
understand
it
was
her
calm
response
i
recall
another
event
was
when
some
caller
dropped
in
and
we
had
drifted
into
a
discussion
about
ghosts
and
the
like
and
i
no
doubt
we
all
talked
some
delicious
nonsense
miriam
said
nothing
at
the
time
but
when
we
were
alone
i
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
it
thought
you
were
all
merely
talking
against
time
she
retorted
evasively
miriam
do
you
really
think
it
is
possible
for
ghosts
detest
that
word
spirits
then
to
return
after
death
or
to
appear
to
anyone
apart
from
the
flesh
will
tell
you
what
i
know
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
sidney
if
he
were
to
die
or
be
killed
he
would
come
to
me
himself
and
tell
me
one
day
miriam
came
down
to
lunch
looking
pale
and
worried
after
dick
went
out
i
asked
her
if
anything
were
wrong
has
happened
to
sidney
she
replied
painful
accident
i
do
know
what
do
you
know
i
cried
then
as
she
looked
at
me
strangely
i
added
hastily
have
been
receiving
any
more
unearthly
messages
have
you
surely
miriam
you
are
not
so
foolish
as
to
really
believe
in
that
know
she
answered
quickly
or
disbelief
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
yes
i
have
had
a
message
i
know
that
some
accident
has
happened
to
sidney
painful
and
inconvenient
but
not
particularly
dangerous
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
sidney
will
write
me
that
he
writes
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
communication
is
perfected
yet
then
i
said
mischievously
but
observing
how
really
worried
she
seemed
i
added
fret
miriam
you
may
be
mistaken
well
two
days
afterwards
she
got
a
note
from
her
lover
the
first
i
had
ever
known
her
to
receive
in
which
he
said
he
had
been
thrown
from
his
horse
and
had
broken
his
left
arm
it
had
happened
the
very
morning
miriam
received
her
message
miriam
had
been
with
us
about
eight
months
when
one
day
she
came
into
my
room
hurriedly
she
was
very
pale
is
ill
dangerously
what
shall
i
do
i
knew
she
must
have
had
another
of
those
abominable
messages
or
thought
she
had
and
really
remembering
the
incident
of
the
broken
arm
i
could
feel
as
sceptical
as
i
pretended
to
i
tried
to
cheer
her
but
did
not
succeed
two
hours
later
she
had
a
telegram
from
her
lover
college
chum
saying
that
claxton
was
dangerously
ill
with
typhoid
fever
i
was
quite
alarmed
about
miriam
in
the
days
that
followed
she
grieved
and
fretted
continually
one
of
her
troubles
was
that
she
received
no
more
messages
she
said
it
was
because
sidney
was
too
ill
to
send
them
anyhow
she
had
to
content
herself
with
the
means
of
communication
used
by
ordinary
mortals
sidney
mother
who
had
gone
to
nurse
him
wrote
every
day
and
at
last
good
news
came
the
crisis
was
over
and
the
doctor
in
attendance
thought
sidney
would
recover
miriam
seemed
like
a
new
creature
then
and
rapidly
recovered
her
spirits
for
a
week
reports
continued
favourable
one
night
we
went
to
the
opera
to
hear
a
celebrated
prima
donna
when
we
returned
home
miriam
and
i
were
sitting
in
her
room
chatting
over
the
events
of
the
evening
suddenly
she
sat
straight
up
with
a
sort
of
convulsive
shudder
and
at
the
same
time
you
may
laugh
if
you
like
the
most
horrible
feeling
came
over
me
i
did
see
anything
but
i
just
felt
that
there
was
something
or
someone
in
the
room
besides
ourselves
miriam
was
gazing
straight
before
her
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
held
out
her
hands
she
said
then
she
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
i
screamed
for
dick
rang
the
bell
and
rushed
to
her
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
household
was
aroused
and
dick
was
off
posthaste
for
the
doctor
for
we
could
not
revive
miriam
from
her
swoon
she
seemed
as
one
dead
we
worked
over
her
for
hours
she
would
come
out
of
her
faint
for
a
moment
give
us
an
unknowing
stare
and
go
shudderingly
off
again
the
doctor
talked
of
some
fearful
shock
but
i
kept
my
own
counsel
at
dawn
miriam
came
back
to
life
at
last
when
she
and
i
were
left
alone
she
turned
to
me
is
dead
she
said
quietly
saw
him
just
before
i
fainted
i
looked
up
and
he
was
standing
between
me
and
you
he
had
come
to
say
farewell
what
could
i
say
almost
while
we
were
talking
a
telegram
came
he
was
dead
he
had
died
at
the
very
hour
at
which
miriam
had
seen
him
sefton
paused
and
the
lunch
bell
rang
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
queried
as
we
rose
honestly
i
do
know
what
i
think
of
it
i
answered
frankly
miss
calista
peppermint
bottle
miss
calista
was
perplexed
her
nephew
caleb
cramp
who
had
been
her
man
for
years
and
whom
she
had
got
well
broken
into
her
ways
had
gone
to
the
klondike
leaving
her
to
fill
his
place
with
the
next
best
man
but
the
next
best
man
was
slow
to
appear
and
meanwhile
miss
calista
was
looking
about
her
warily
she
could
afford
to
wait
a
while
for
the
crop
was
all
in
and
the
fall
ploughing
done
so
that
the
need
of
a
successor
to
caleb
was
not
as
pressing
as
it
might
otherwise
have
been
there
was
no
lack
of
applicants
such
as
they
were
miss
calista
was
known
to
be
a
kind
and
generous
mistress
although
she
had
her
ways
and
insisted
calmly
and
immovably
upon
wholehearted
compliance
with
them
she
had
a
small
farm
and
a
comfortable
house
and
her
hired
men
lived
in
clover
caleb
cramp
had
been
perfection
after
his
kind
and
miss
calista
did
not
expect
to
find
his
equal
nevertheless
she
set
up
a
certain
standard
of
requirements
and
although
three
weeks
during
which
miss
calista
had
been
obliged
to
put
up
with
the
immature
services
of
a
boy
had
elapsed
since
caleb
departure
no
one
had
as
yet
stepped
into
his
vacant
and
coveted
shoes
certainly
miss
calista
was
somewhat
hard
to
please
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
as
she
sat
by
her
front
window
in
the
chilly
november
twilight
instead
she
was
musing
on
the
degeneration
of
hired
men
and
reflecting
that
it
was
high
time
the
wheat
was
thrashed
the
house
banked
and
sundry
other
duties
attended
to
ches
maybin
had
been
up
that
afternoon
to
negotiate
for
the
vacant
place
and
had
offered
to
give
satisfaction
for
smaller
wages
than
miss
calista
had
ever
paid
but
he
had
met
with
a
brusque
refusal
scarcely
as
civil
as
miss
calista
had
bestowed
on
drunken
jake
stinson
from
the
morrisvale
road
not
that
miss
calista
had
any
particular
prejudice
against
ches
maybin
or
knew
anything
positively
to
his
discredit
she
was
simply
unconsciously
following
the
example
of
a
world
that
exerts
itself
to
keep
a
man
down
when
he
is
down
and
prevent
all
chance
of
his
rising
nothing
succeeds
like
success
and
the
converse
of
this
is
likewise
true
that
nothing
fails
like
failure
there
was
not
a
person
in
cooperstown
who
would
not
have
heartily
endorsed
miss
refusal
ches
maybin
was
only
eighteen
although
he
looked
several
years
older
and
although
no
flagrant
misdoing
had
ever
been
proved
against
him
suspicion
of
such
was
not
wanting
he
came
of
a
bad
stock
people
said
sagely
adding
that
what
was
bred
in
the
bone
was
bound
to
come
out
in
the
flesh
his
father
old
sam
maybin
had
been
a
shiftless
and
tricky
rascal
as
everybody
knew
and
had
ended
his
days
in
the
poorhouse
ches
mother
had
died
when
he
was
a
baby
and
he
had
come
up
somehow
in
a
fashion
with
all
the
cloud
of
heredity
hanging
over
him
he
was
always
looked
at
askance
and
when
any
mischief
came
to
light
in
the
village
it
was
generally
fastened
on
him
as
a
convenient
and
handy
scapegoat
he
was
considered
sulky
and
lazy
and
the
local
prophets
united
in
predicting
a
bad
end
for
him
sooner
or
later
and
moreover
diligently
endeavoured
by
their
general
treatment
of
him
to
put
him
in
a
fair
way
to
fulfil
their
predictions
miss
calista
when
she
had
shut
chester
maybin
out
into
the
chill
gloom
of
the
november
dusk
dismissed
him
from
her
thoughts
there
were
other
things
of
more
moment
to
her
just
then
than
old
sam
maybin
hopeful
son
there
was
nobody
in
the
house
but
herself
and
although
this
was
neither
alarming
nor
unusual
it
was
unusual
and
miss
calista
considered
it
alarming
that
the
sum
of
five
hundred
dollars
should
at
that
very
moment
be
in
the
upper
drawer
of
the
sideboard
which
sum
had
been
up
to
the
previous
day
safe
in
the
coffers
of
the
millageville
bank
but
certain
unfavourable
rumours
were
in
course
of
circulation
about
that
same
institution
and
miss
calista
who
was
nothing
if
not
prudent
had
gone
to
the
bank
that
very
morning
and
withdrawn
her
deposit
she
intended
to
go
over
to
kerrytown
the
very
next
day
and
deposit
it
in
the
savings
bank
there
not
another
day
would
she
keep
it
in
the
house
and
indeed
it
worried
her
to
think
she
must
keep
it
even
for
the
night
as
she
had
told
galloway
that
afternoon
during
a
neighbourly
chat
not
but
what
it
safe
enough
she
said
for
not
a
soul
but
you
knows
i
got
it
but
i
not
used
to
have
so
much
by
me
and
there
are
always
tramps
going
round
it
worries
me
somehow
i
would
give
it
a
thought
if
caleb
was
here
i
being
all
alone
makes
me
nervous
miss
calista
was
still
rather
nervous
when
she
went
to
bed
that
night
but
she
was
a
woman
of
sound
sense
and
was
determined
not
to
give
way
to
foolish
fears
she
locked
doors
and
windows
carefully
as
was
her
habit
and
saw
that
the
fastenings
were
good
and
secure
the
one
on
the
window
looking
out
on
the
back
yard
was
in
fact
it
was
broken
altogether
but
as
miss
calista
told
herself
it
had
been
broken
just
so
for
the
last
six
years
and
nobody
had
ever
tried
to
get
in
at
it
yet
and
it
was
likely
anyone
would
begin
tonight
miss
calista
went
to
bed
and
despite
her
worry
slept
soon
and
soundly
it
was
well
on
past
midnight
when
she
suddenly
wakened
and
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
she
was
not
accustomed
to
waken
in
the
night
and
she
had
the
impression
of
having
been
awakened
by
some
noise
she
listened
breathlessly
her
room
was
directly
over
the
and
an
empty
stovepipe
hole
opened
up
through
the
ceiling
of
the
latter
at
the
head
of
her
bed
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
something
or
some
person
was
moving
about
stealthily
in
the
room
below
it
was
the
cat
miss
calista
had
shut
him
in
the
woodshed
before
she
went
to
bed
and
he
possibly
get
out
it
must
certainly
be
a
beggar
or
tramp
of
some
description
miss
calista
might
be
given
over
to
nervousness
in
regard
to
imaginary
thieves
but
in
the
presence
of
real
danger
she
was
cool
and
as
noiselessly
and
swiftly
as
any
burglar
himself
miss
calista
slipped
out
of
bed
and
into
her
clothes
then
she
out
into
the
hall
the
late
moonlight
streaming
in
through
the
hall
windows
was
quite
enough
illumination
for
her
purpose
and
she
got
downstairs
and
was
fairly
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
before
a
sound
betrayed
her
presence
standing
at
the
sideboard
hastily
ransacking
the
neat
contents
of
an
open
drawer
stood
a
man
figure
dimly
visible
in
the
moonlight
gloom
as
miss
calista
grim
form
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
midnight
marauder
turned
with
a
start
and
then
with
an
inarticulate
cry
sprang
not
at
the
courageous
lady
but
at
the
open
window
behind
him
miss
calista
realizing
with
a
flash
of
comprehension
that
he
was
escaping
her
had
a
impulse
to
get
a
blow
in
anyhow
she
grasped
and
hurled
at
her
unceremonious
caller
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
a
bottle
of
peppermint
essence
that
was
standing
on
the
sideboard
the
missile
hit
the
escaping
thief
squarely
on
the
shoulder
as
he
sprang
out
of
the
window
and
the
fragments
of
glass
came
clattering
down
on
the
sill
the
next
moment
miss
calista
found
herself
alone
standing
by
the
sideboard
in
a
fashion
for
the
whole
thing
had
passed
with
such
rapidity
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
dissolving
end
of
a
bad
dream
but
the
open
drawer
and
the
window
where
the
bits
of
glass
were
glistening
in
the
moonlight
were
no
dream
miss
calista
recovered
herself
speedily
closed
the
window
lit
the
lamp
gathered
up
the
broken
glass
and
set
up
the
chairs
which
the
thief
had
upset
in
his
exit
an
examination
of
the
sideboard
showed
the
precious
five
hundred
safe
and
sound
in
an
undisturbed
drawer
miss
calista
kept
grim
watch
and
ward
there
until
morning
and
thought
the
matter
over
exhaustively
in
the
end
she
resolved
to
keep
her
own
counsel
she
had
no
clue
whatever
to
the
thief
whereabouts
or
identity
and
no
good
would
come
of
making
a
fuss
which
might
only
end
in
throwing
suspicion
on
someone
who
might
be
quite
innocent
when
the
morning
came
miss
calista
lost
no
time
in
setting
out
for
kerrytown
where
the
money
was
soon
safely
deposited
in
the
bank
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
left
the
building
i
feel
as
if
i
could
enjoy
life
once
more
she
said
to
herself
goodness
me
if
i
had
to
keep
that
money
by
me
for
a
week
itself
i
have
been
a
raving
lunatic
by
the
end
of
it
miss
calista
had
shopping
to
do
and
friends
to
visit
in
town
so
that
the
dull
autumn
day
was
well
nigh
spent
when
she
finally
got
back
to
cooperstown
and
paused
at
the
corner
store
to
get
a
bundle
of
matches
the
store
was
full
of
men
smoking
and
chatting
around
the
fire
and
miss
calista
whose
pet
abomination
was
tobacco
smoke
was
not
at
all
minded
to
wait
any
longer
than
she
could
help
but
abiram
fell
was
attending
to
a
previous
customer
and
miss
calista
sat
grimly
down
by
the
counter
to
wait
her
turn
the
door
opened
letting
in
a
swirl
of
raw
november
evening
wind
and
ches
maybin
he
nodded
sullenly
to
fell
and
passed
down
the
store
to
mutter
a
message
to
a
man
at
the
further
end
miss
calista
lifted
her
head
as
he
passed
and
sniffed
the
air
as
a
charger
who
scents
battle
the
smell
of
tobacco
was
strong
and
so
was
that
of
the
open
boxes
of
dried
herring
on
the
counter
but
plainly
above
all
the
commingled
odours
of
a
country
grocery
miss
calista
caught
a
whiff
of
peppermint
so
strong
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
its
origin
there
had
been
no
hint
of
it
before
ches
maybin
entrance
the
latter
did
not
wait
long
he
was
out
and
striding
along
the
shadowy
road
when
miss
calista
left
the
store
and
drove
smartly
after
him
it
never
took
miss
calista
long
to
make
up
her
mind
about
anything
and
she
had
weighed
and
passed
judgement
on
ches
case
while
fell
was
doing
up
her
matches
the
lad
glanced
up
furtively
as
she
checked
her
fat
grey
pony
beside
him
good
evening
chester
she
said
with
brisk
kindness
i
can
give
you
a
lift
if
you
are
going
my
way
jump
in
quick
dapple
is
a
little
restless
a
wave
of
crimson
duskily
perceptible
under
his
sunburned
skin
surged
over
ches
maybin
face
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
blurt
out
a
blunt
refusal
but
miss
calista
face
was
so
guileless
and
her
tone
so
friendly
that
he
thought
better
of
it
and
sprang
in
beside
her
and
dapple
broke
into
an
impatient
trot
down
the
long
hill
lined
with
its
bare
maples
after
a
few
minutes
silence
miss
calista
turned
to
her
moody
companion
chester
she
said
as
tranquilly
as
if
about
to
ask
him
the
most
ordinary
question
in
the
world
why
did
you
climb
into
my
house
last
night
and
try
to
steal
my
money
ches
maybin
started
convulsively
as
if
he
meant
to
spring
from
the
buggy
at
once
but
miss
calista
hand
was
on
his
arm
in
a
grasp
none
the
less
firm
because
of
its
gentleness
and
there
was
a
warning
gleam
in
her
grey
eyes
it
wo
mend
matters
trying
to
get
clear
of
me
chester
i
know
it
was
you
and
i
want
an
answer
a
truthful
one
mind
you
to
my
question
i
am
your
friend
and
i
am
not
going
to
harm
you
if
you
tell
me
the
truth
her
clear
and
incisive
gaze
met
and
held
irresistibly
the
wavering
one
the
sullen
obstinacy
of
his
face
relaxed
well
he
muttered
finally
i
was
just
desperate
that
why
never
done
anything
real
bad
in
my
life
before
but
people
have
always
been
down
on
me
i
blamed
for
everything
and
nobody
wants
anything
to
do
with
me
i
willing
to
work
but
i
ca
get
a
thing
to
do
in
rags
and
i
have
a
cent
and
winter
coming
on
i
heard
you
telling
galloway
yesterday
about
the
money
i
was
behind
the
fir
hedge
and
you
did
see
me
i
went
away
and
planned
it
all
out
get
in
some
way
and
i
meant
to
use
the
money
to
get
away
out
west
as
far
from
here
as
i
could
and
begin
life
there
where
nobody
knew
me
and
where
i
have
some
sort
of
a
chance
i
never
had
any
here
you
can
put
me
in
jail
now
if
you
like
they
feed
and
clothe
me
there
anyhow
and
i
be
on
a
level
with
the
rest
the
boy
had
blurted
it
all
out
sullenly
and
a
world
of
rebellion
and
protest
against
the
fate
that
had
always
dragged
him
down
was
couched
in
his
voice
miss
calista
drew
dapple
to
a
standstill
before
her
gate
i
not
going
to
send
you
to
jail
chester
i
believe
you
told
me
the
truth
yesterday
you
wanted
me
to
give
you
caleb
place
and
i
refused
well
i
offer
it
to
you
now
if
you
come
i
hire
you
and
give
you
as
good
wages
as
i
gave
him
ches
maybin
looked
incredulous
miss
calista
you
ca
mean
it
i
do
mean
it
every
word
you
say
you
have
never
had
a
chance
well
i
am
going
to
give
you
one
a
chance
to
get
on
the
right
road
and
make
a
man
of
yourself
nobody
shall
ever
know
about
last
night
doings
from
me
and
i
make
it
my
business
to
forget
them
if
you
deserve
it
what
do
you
say
ches
lifted
his
head
and
looked
her
squarely
in
the
face
i
come
he
said
huskily
it
ai
no
use
to
try
and
thank
you
miss
calista
but
i
live
my
thanks
and
he
did
the
good
people
of
cooperstown
held
up
their
hands
in
horror
when
they
heard
that
miss
calista
had
hired
ches
maybin
and
prophesied
that
the
deluded
woman
would
live
to
repent
her
rash
step
but
not
all
prophecies
come
true
miss
calista
smiled
serenely
and
kept
on
her
own
misguided
way
and
ches
maybin
proved
so
efficient
and
steady
that
the
arrangement
was
continued
and
in
due
time
people
outlived
their
old
suspicions
and
came
to
regard
him
as
a
thoroughly
smart
and
trustworthy
young
man
miss
calista
has
made
a
man
of
ches
maybin
said
the
oracles
he
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
her
and
he
was
but
only
he
and
miss
calista
and
the
peppermint
bottle
ever
knew
the
precise
extent
of
his
gratitude
and
they
never
told
the
jest
that
failed
i
think
it
is
simply
a
disgrace
to
have
a
person
like
that
in
our
class
said
edna
hayden
in
an
injured
tone
and
she
does
seem
a
bit
ashamed
of
it
either
said
agnes
walters
rather
proud
of
it
i
should
say
returned
her
roommate
spitefully
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
so
poor
that
i
had
to
myself
and
dress
as
dowdily
as
she
does
that
i
really
could
look
anybody
in
the
face
what
must
the
boys
think
of
her
and
if
it
was
for
her
being
in
it
our
class
would
be
the
smartest
and
dressiest
in
the
college
even
those
senior
girls
admit
that
it
a
shame
said
agnes
conclusively
but
she
need
expect
to
associate
with
our
set
i
for
one
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
her
nor
i
think
it
is
time
she
should
be
taught
her
place
if
we
could
only
manage
to
inflict
some
decided
snub
on
her
she
might
take
the
hint
and
give
up
trying
to
poke
herself
in
where
she
does
belong
the
idea
of
her
consenting
to
be
elected
on
the
freshmen
executive
but
she
seems
impervious
to
snubs
edna
let
play
a
joke
on
her
it
will
serve
her
right
let
us
send
an
invitation
in
somebody
name
to
the
senior
the
very
thing
and
sign
sidney
hill
name
to
it
he
the
handsomest
and
richest
fellows
at
payzant
and
belongs
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
town
and
he
awfully
fastidious
besides
no
doubt
she
will
feel
immensely
flattered
and
of
course
she
accept
just
think
how
silly
she
feel
when
she
finds
out
he
never
sent
it
write
it
now
and
send
it
at
once
there
is
no
time
to
lose
for
the
is
on
thursday
night
the
freshmen
at
payzant
college
did
not
like
grace
seeley
that
is
to
say
the
majority
of
them
they
were
a
decidedly
snobbish
class
that
year
no
one
could
deny
that
grace
was
clever
but
she
was
poor
dressed
very
plainly
dowdily
the
girls
said
and
roomed
herself
that
phrase
meaning
that
she
rented
a
little
unfurnished
room
and
cooked
her
own
meals
over
an
oil
stove
the
senior
prom
as
it
was
called
was
the
annual
reception
which
the
senior
class
gave
in
the
middle
of
every
autumn
term
it
was
the
smartest
and
gayest
of
all
the
college
functions
and
a
payzant
who
received
an
invitation
to
it
counted
herself
fortunate
the
senior
girls
were
included
as
a
matter
of
course
but
a
junior
soph
or
freshie
could
not
go
unless
one
of
the
senior
boys
invited
her
grace
seeley
was
studying
greek
in
her
tiny
room
that
afternoon
when
the
invitation
was
brought
to
her
it
was
scrupulously
orthodox
in
appearance
and
form
and
grace
never
doubted
that
it
was
genuine
although
she
felt
much
surprised
that
sidney
hill
the
leader
of
his
class
and
the
foremost
figure
in
all
college
sports
and
societies
should
have
asked
her
to
go
with
him
to
the
senior
prom
but
she
was
girlishly
pleased
at
the
prospect
she
was
as
fond
of
a
good
time
as
any
other
girl
and
she
had
secretly
wished
very
much
that
she
could
go
to
the
brilliant
and
much
talked
about
senior
prom
grace
was
quite
unaware
of
her
own
unpopularity
among
her
class
although
she
thought
it
was
very
hard
to
get
acquainted
with
them
without
any
false
pride
herself
and
of
a
frank
independent
nature
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
other
payzant
freshies
could
look
down
on
her
because
she
was
poor
or
resent
her
presence
among
them
because
she
dressed
plainly
she
straightway
wrote
a
note
of
acceptance
to
sidney
hill
and
that
young
man
naturally
felt
much
mystified
when
he
opened
and
read
it
in
the
college
library
next
morning
grace
seeley
he
pondered
that
the
jolly
girl
with
the
brown
eyes
that
i
met
at
the
philomathic
the
other
night
she
thanks
me
for
my
invitation
to
the
senior
prom
and
accepts
with
pleasure
why
i
certainly
never
invited
her
or
anyone
else
to
go
with
me
to
the
senior
prom
there
must
be
some
mistake
grace
passed
him
at
this
moment
on
her
way
to
the
latin
classroom
she
bowed
and
smiled
in
a
friendly
fashion
and
sidney
hill
felt
decidedly
uncomfortable
what
was
he
to
do
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
putting
miss
seeley
in
a
false
position
because
somebody
had
sent
her
an
invitation
in
his
name
i
suppose
it
is
some
cad
who
has
a
spite
at
me
that
has
done
it
he
reflected
but
if
so
i
spoil
his
game
i
take
miss
seeley
to
the
prom
as
if
i
had
never
intended
doing
anything
else
she
sha
be
humiliated
just
because
there
is
someone
at
payzant
who
would
stoop
to
that
sort
of
thing
so
he
walked
up
the
hall
with
grace
and
expressed
his
pleasure
at
her
acceptance
and
on
the
evening
of
the
prom
he
sent
her
a
bouquet
of
white
carnations
whose
spicy
fragrance
reminded
her
of
her
own
little
garden
at
home
grace
thought
it
extremely
nice
of
him
and
dressed
in
a
flutter
of
pleasant
anticipation
her
gown
was
a
very
simple
one
of
sheer
white
organdie
and
was
the
only
evening
dress
she
had
she
knew
there
would
be
many
smarter
dresses
at
the
reception
but
the
knowledge
did
not
disturb
her
sensible
head
in
the
least
she
fingered
the
dainty
white
frills
lovingly
as
she
remembered
the
sunny
summer
days
at
home
in
the
little
where
cherry
boughs
poked
their
blossoms
in
at
the
window
when
her
mother
and
sisters
had
helped
her
to
make
it
with
laughing
prophesies
and
speculations
as
to
its
first
appearance
into
seam
and
puff
and
frill
many
girlish
hopes
and
dreams
had
been
sewn
and
they
all
came
back
to
grace
as
she
put
it
on
and
helped
to
surround
her
with
an
atmosphere
of
happiness
when
she
was
ready
she
picked
up
her
bouquet
and
looked
herself
over
in
the
mirror
from
the
top
of
her
curly
head
to
the
tips
of
her
white
shoes
with
a
little
nod
of
satisfaction
grace
was
not
exactly
pretty
but
she
had
such
a
bright
happy
face
and
such
merry
brown
eyes
and
such
a
friendly
smile
that
she
was
very
pleasant
to
look
upon
and
a
great
many
people
thought
so
that
night
grace
had
never
in
all
her
life
before
had
so
good
a
time
as
she
had
at
that
senior
prom
the
seniors
were
quick
to
discover
her
unaffected
originality
and
charm
and
everywhere
she
went
she
was
the
centre
of
a
merry
group
in
short
grace
as
much
to
her
own
surprise
as
anyone
found
herself
a
social
success
presently
sidney
brought
his
brother
up
to
be
introduced
and
the
latter
said
miss
seeley
will
you
excuse
my
asking
if
you
have
a
brother
or
any
relative
named
max
seeley
grace
nodded
oh
yes
my
brother
max
he
is
a
doctor
out
west
i
was
sure
of
it
said
murray
hill
triumphantly
you
resemble
him
so
strongly
please
do
consider
me
as
a
stranger
a
minute
longer
for
max
and
i
are
like
brothers
indeed
i
owe
my
life
to
him
last
summer
i
was
out
there
on
a
surveying
expedition
and
i
took
typhoid
in
a
little
place
where
good
nursing
was
not
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
your
brother
attended
me
and
he
managed
to
pull
me
through
he
never
left
me
day
or
night
until
i
was
out
of
danger
and
he
worked
like
a
trojan
for
me
dear
old
max
said
grace
her
brown
eyes
shining
with
pride
and
pleasure
that
is
so
like
him
he
is
such
a
dear
brother
and
i
have
seen
him
for
four
years
to
see
somebody
who
knows
him
so
well
is
next
best
thing
to
seeing
himself
he
is
an
awfully
fine
fellow
said
hill
heartily
and
delighted
to
have
met
the
sister
he
used
to
talk
so
much
about
i
want
you
to
come
ever
and
meet
my
mother
and
sister
they
have
heard
me
talk
so
much
about
max
that
they
think
almost
as
much
of
him
as
i
do
and
they
will
be
glad
to
meet
his
sister
hill
a
handsome
dignified
lady
who
was
one
of
the
chaperones
of
the
prom
received
grace
warmly
while
beatrice
hill
an
extremely
pretty
smartly
gowned
girl
made
her
feel
at
home
immediately
you
came
with
sid
did
you
she
whispered
sid
is
so
sly
he
never
tells
us
whom
he
is
going
to
take
anywhere
but
when
i
saw
you
come
in
with
him
i
knew
i
was
going
to
like
you
you
looked
so
jolly
and
you
really
the
sister
of
that
splendid
seeley
who
saved
murray
life
last
summer
and
to
think
you
been
at
payzant
nearly
a
whole
term
and
we
never
knew
it
well
how
have
you
enjoyed
our
prom
miss
seeley
asked
sid
as
they
walked
home
together
under
the
arching
elms
of
the
college
campus
oh
it
was
splendid
said
grace
enthusiastically
everybody
was
so
nice
and
then
to
meet
someone
who
could
tell
me
so
much
about
max
i
must
write
them
home
all
about
it
before
i
sleep
just
to
calm
my
head
a
bit
mother
and
the
girls
will
be
so
interested
and
i
must
send
lou
and
mab
a
carnation
apiece
for
their
scrapbooks
give
me
one
back
please
said
sid
and
grace
with
a
little
blush
did
so
that
night
while
grace
was
slipping
the
stems
of
her
carnations
and
putting
them
into
water
three
little
bits
of
conversation
were
being
carried
on
which
it
is
necessary
to
report
in
order
to
round
up
this
story
neatly
and
properly
as
all
stories
should
be
rounded
up
in
the
first
place
beatrice
hill
was
saying
to
sidney
oh
sid
that
miss
seeley
you
had
at
the
prom
is
a
lovely
girl
i
do
know
when
i
met
anyone
i
liked
so
much
she
was
so
jolly
and
friendly
and
she
did
put
on
learned
airs
at
all
as
so
many
of
those
payzant
girls
do
i
asked
her
all
about
herself
and
she
told
me
and
all
about
her
mother
and
sisters
and
home
and
the
lovely
times
they
had
together
and
how
hard
they
worked
to
send
her
to
college
too
and
how
she
taught
school
in
vacations
and
herself
to
help
along
it
so
brave
and
plucky
of
her
i
know
we
are
going
to
be
great
friends
i
hope
so
said
sidney
briefly
because
i
have
an
idea
that
she
and
i
are
going
to
be
very
good
friends
too
and
sidney
went
upstairs
and
put
away
a
single
white
carnation
very
carefully
in
the
second
place
hill
was
saying
to
her
eldest
son
i
liked
that
miss
seeley
very
much
she
seemed
a
very
sweet
girl
and
finally
agnes
walters
and
edna
hayden
were
discussing
the
matter
in
great
mystification
in
their
room
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
said
agnes
slowly
sid
hill
took
her
to
the
prom
and
he
must
have
sent
her
those
carnations
too
she
could
never
have
afforded
them
herself
and
did
you
see
the
fuss
his
people
made
over
her
i
heard
beatrice
telling
her
that
she
was
coming
to
call
on
her
tomorrow
and
hill
said
she
must
look
upon
as
her
second
home
while
she
was
at
payzant
if
the
hills
are
going
to
take
her
up
we
have
to
be
nice
to
her
i
suppose
said
edna
conclusively
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
sid
hill
meant
to
ask
her
anyway
i
dare
say
he
asked
her
long
ago
and
she
would
know
our
invitation
was
a
fraud
so
the
joke
is
on
ourselves
after
all
but
as
you
and
i
know
that
with
the
exception
of
the
last
sentence
was
not
the
truth
of
the
matter
at
all
the
penningtons
girl
winslow
had
been
fishing
or
pretending
to
all
the
morning
and
he
was
desperately
thirsty
he
boarded
with
the
beckwiths
on
the
riverside
east
shore
but
he
was
nearer
riverside
west
and
he
knew
the
penningtons
well
he
had
often
been
there
for
bait
and
milk
and
had
listened
times
out
of
mind
to
pennington
dismal
tales
of
her
tribulations
with
hired
girls
she
never
could
get
along
with
them
and
they
left
on
an
average
after
a
fortnight
trial
she
was
on
the
lookout
for
one
now
he
knew
and
would
likely
be
cross
but
he
thought
she
would
give
him
a
drink
he
rowed
his
skiff
into
the
shore
and
tied
it
to
a
fir
that
hung
out
from
the
bank
a
winding
little
footpath
led
up
to
the
pennington
farmhouse
which
crested
the
hill
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
winslow
made
for
the
kitchen
door
and
came
face
to
face
with
a
girl
carrying
a
pail
of
water
pennington
latest
thing
in
hired
girls
of
course
winslow
first
bewildered
thought
was
what
a
goddess
and
he
wondered
as
he
politely
asked
for
a
drink
where
on
earth
pennington
had
picked
her
up
she
handed
him
a
shining
dipper
half
full
and
stood
pail
in
hand
while
he
drank
it
she
was
rather
tall
and
wore
a
somewhat
limp
faded
print
gown
and
a
big
sunhat
beneath
which
a
glossy
knot
of
chestnut
showed
itself
her
skin
was
very
fair
somewhat
freckled
and
her
mouth
was
delicious
as
for
her
eyes
they
were
grey
but
beyond
that
simply
defied
description
will
you
have
some
more
she
asked
in
a
soft
drawling
voice
no
thank
you
that
was
delicious
is
pennington
home
no
she
has
gone
away
for
the
day
well
i
suppose
i
can
sit
down
here
and
rest
a
while
you
no
serious
objections
have
you
oh
no
she
carried
her
pail
into
the
kitchen
and
came
out
again
presently
with
a
knife
and
a
pan
of
apples
sitting
down
on
a
bench
under
the
poplars
she
proceeded
to
peel
them
with
a
disregard
of
his
presence
that
piqued
winslow
who
was
not
used
to
being
ignored
in
this
fashion
besides
as
a
general
rule
he
had
been
quite
good
friends
with
pennington
hired
girls
she
had
had
three
strapping
damsels
during
his
sojourn
in
riverside
and
he
used
to
sit
on
this
very
doorstep
and
chaff
them
they
had
all
been
saucy
and
talkative
this
girl
was
evidently
a
new
species
do
you
think
you
get
along
with
mrs
pennington
he
asked
finally
as
a
rule
she
fights
with
her
help
although
she
is
a
most
estimable
woman
the
girl
smiled
quite
broadly
i
guess
she
rather
hard
to
suit
was
the
answer
but
i
like
her
pretty
well
so
far
i
think
we
get
along
with
each
other
if
we
do
i
can
leave
like
the
others
did
what
is
your
name
nelly
ray
well
nelly
i
hope
you
be
able
to
keep
your
place
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
friendly
advice
do
let
the
cats
get
into
the
pantry
that
is
what
pennington
has
quarrelled
with
nearly
every
one
of
her
girls
about
it
is
quite
a
bother
to
keep
them
out
ai
it
said
nelly
calmly
there
dozens
of
cats
about
the
place
what
on
earth
makes
them
keep
so
many
pennington
has
a
mania
for
cats
he
and
pennington
have
a
standing
disagreement
about
it
the
last
girl
left
here
because
she
could
stand
the
cats
they
affected
her
nerves
she
said
i
hope
you
do
mind
them
oh
no
i
kind
of
like
cats
i
been
tryin
to
count
them
has
anyone
ever
done
that
not
that
i
know
of
i
tried
but
i
had
to
give
up
in
despair
never
could
tell
when
i
was
counting
the
same
cat
over
again
look
at
that
black
goblin
sunning
himself
on
the
woodpile
i
say
nelly
you
not
going
are
you
i
must
it
time
to
get
dinner
pennington
will
be
in
from
the
fields
soon
the
next
minute
he
heard
her
stepping
briskly
about
the
kitchen
shooing
out
intruding
cats
and
humming
a
darky
air
to
herself
he
went
reluctantly
back
to
the
shore
and
rowed
across
the
river
in
a
brown
study
i
do
know
whether
winslow
was
afflicted
with
chronic
thirst
or
not
or
whether
the
east
side
water
was
so
good
as
that
of
the
west
side
but
i
do
know
that
he
fairly
haunted
the
pennington
farmhouse
after
that
pennington
was
home
the
next
time
he
went
and
he
asked
her
about
her
new
girl
to
his
surprise
the
good
lady
was
unusually
reticent
she
could
really
say
very
much
about
nelly
no
she
did
belong
anywhere
near
riverside
in
fact
she
pennington
did
think
she
had
any
settled
home
at
present
her
father
was
travelling
over
the
country
somewhere
nelly
was
a
good
little
girl
and
very
obliging
beyond
this
winslow
could
get
no
more
information
so
he
went
around
and
talked
to
nelly
who
was
sitting
on
the
bench
under
the
poplars
and
seemed
absorbed
in
watching
the
sunset
she
dropped
her
g
badly
and
made
some
grammatical
errors
that
caused
winslow
flesh
to
creep
on
his
bones
but
any
man
could
have
forgiven
mistakes
from
such
dimpled
lips
in
such
a
sweet
voice
he
asked
her
to
go
for
a
row
up
the
river
in
the
twilight
and
she
assented
she
handled
an
oar
very
well
he
found
out
and
the
exercise
became
her
winslow
tried
to
get
her
to
talk
about
herself
but
failed
signally
and
had
to
content
himself
with
pennington
meagre
information
he
told
her
about
himself
frankly
enough
how
he
had
had
fever
in
the
spring
and
had
been
ordered
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
country
and
do
nothing
useful
until
his
health
was
fully
restored
and
how
lonesome
it
was
in
riverside
in
general
and
at
the
beckwith
farm
in
particular
he
made
out
quite
a
dismal
case
for
himself
and
if
nelly
was
sorry
for
him
she
should
have
been
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
riverside
folks
began
to
talk
about
winslow
and
the
penningtons
hired
girl
he
was
reported
to
be
dead
gone
on
her
he
took
her
out
rowing
every
evening
drove
her
to
preaching
up
the
bend
on
sunday
nights
and
haunted
the
pennington
farmhouse
wise
folks
shook
their
heads
over
it
and
wondered
that
pennington
allowed
it
winslow
was
a
gentleman
and
that
nelly
ray
whom
nobody
knew
anything
about
not
even
where
she
came
from
was
only
a
common
hired
girl
and
he
had
no
business
to
be
hanging
about
her
she
was
pretty
to
be
sure
but
she
was
absurdly
and
associate
with
other
riverside
help
at
all
well
pride
must
have
a
fall
there
must
be
something
queer
about
her
when
she
was
so
awful
sly
as
to
her
past
life
winslow
and
nelly
did
not
trouble
themselves
in
the
least
over
all
this
gossip
in
fact
they
never
even
heard
it
winslow
was
hopelessly
in
love
when
he
found
this
out
he
was
aghast
he
thought
of
his
father
the
ambitious
railroad
magnate
of
his
mother
the
brilliant
society
leader
of
his
sisters
the
beautiful
and
proud
he
was
honestly
frightened
it
would
never
do
he
must
not
go
to
see
nelly
again
he
kept
this
prudent
resolution
for
hours
and
then
rowed
over
to
the
west
shore
he
found
nelly
sitting
on
the
bank
in
her
old
faded
print
dress
and
he
straightway
forgot
everything
he
ought
to
have
remembered
nelly
herself
never
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
the
social
gulf
between
them
at
least
she
never
alluded
to
it
in
any
way
and
accepted
winslow
attentions
as
if
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
them
she
had
broken
the
record
by
staying
with
pennington
four
weeks
and
even
the
cats
were
in
subjection
winslow
was
well
enough
to
have
gone
back
to
the
city
and
in
fact
his
father
was
writing
for
him
but
he
could
leave
beckwiths
apparently
at
any
rate
he
stayed
on
and
met
nelly
every
day
and
cursed
himself
for
a
cad
and
a
cur
and
a
idiot
one
day
he
took
nelly
for
a
row
up
the
river
they
went
further
than
usual
around
the
bend
winslow
did
want
to
go
too
far
for
he
knew
that
a
party
of
his
city
friends
chaperoned
by
were
having
a
picnic
somewhere
up
along
the
river
shore
that
day
but
nelly
insisted
on
going
on
and
on
and
of
course
she
had
her
way
when
they
reached
a
little
headland
they
came
upon
the
picnickers
within
a
stone
throw
everybody
recognized
winslow
why
there
is
burton
he
heard
exclaim
and
he
knew
she
was
putting
up
her
glasses
will
evans
who
was
an
especial
chum
of
his
ran
down
to
the
water
edge
bless
me
win
where
did
you
come
from
come
right
in
we
have
had
tea
yet
bring
your
friend
too
he
added
becoming
conscious
that
winslow
friend
was
a
mighty
pretty
girl
winslow
face
was
crimson
he
avoided
eye
are
them
people
friends
of
yours
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
yes
he
muttered
well
let
us
go
ashore
if
they
want
us
to
she
said
calmly
i
mind
for
three
seconds
winslow
hesitated
then
he
pulled
ashore
and
helped
nelly
to
alight
on
a
jutting
rock
there
was
a
curious
set
expression
about
his
fine
mouth
as
he
marched
nelly
up
to
and
introduced
her
greeting
was
slightly
cool
but
very
polite
she
supposed
miss
ray
was
some
little
country
girl
with
whom
burton
winslow
was
carrying
on
a
summer
flirtation
respectable
enough
no
doubt
and
must
be
treated
civilly
but
of
course
expect
to
be
made
an
equal
of
exactly
the
other
women
took
their
cue
from
her
but
the
men
were
more
cordial
miss
ray
might
be
shabby
but
she
was
distinctly
fetching
and
winslow
looked
savage
nelly
was
not
a
whit
abashed
seemingly
by
the
fashionable
circle
in
which
she
found
herself
and
she
talked
away
to
will
evans
and
the
others
in
her
soft
drawl
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
all
might
have
gone
passably
well
had
not
a
little
riverside
imp
by
name
of
rufus
hent
who
had
been
picked
up
by
the
picnickers
to
run
their
errands
come
up
just
then
with
a
pail
of
water
golly
he
ejaculated
in
very
audible
tones
if
there
ai
pennington
hired
girl
stiffened
with
horror
winslow
darted
a
furious
glance
at
the
that
would
have
annihilated
anything
except
a
small
boy
will
evans
grinned
and
went
on
talking
to
nelly
who
had
failed
to
hear
or
at
least
to
heed
the
exclamation
the
mischief
was
done
the
social
thermometer
went
down
to
zero
in
nelly
neighbourhood
the
women
ignored
her
altogether
winslow
set
his
teeth
together
and
registered
a
mental
vow
to
wring
rufus
sunburned
neck
at
the
first
opportunity
he
escorted
nelly
to
the
table
and
waited
on
her
with
ostentatious
deference
while
glanced
at
him
stonily
and
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
his
mother
when
she
went
home
nelly
social
ostracism
did
not
affect
her
appetite
but
after
lunch
was
over
she
walked
down
to
the
skiff
winslow
followed
her
do
you
want
to
go
home
he
asked
yes
it
time
i
went
for
the
cats
may
be
raidin
the
pantry
but
you
must
not
come
your
friends
here
want
you
nonsense
said
winslow
sulkily
if
you
are
going
i
am
too
but
nelly
was
too
quick
for
him
she
sprang
into
the
skiff
unwound
the
rope
and
pushed
off
before
he
guessed
her
intention
i
can
row
myself
home
and
i
mean
to
she
announced
taking
up
the
oars
defiantly
nelly
he
implored
nelly
looked
at
him
wickedly
you
better
go
back
to
your
friends
that
old
woman
with
the
eyeglasses
is
watchin
you
winslow
said
something
strong
under
his
breath
as
he
went
back
to
the
others
will
evans
and
his
chums
began
to
chaff
him
about
nelly
but
he
looked
so
dangerous
that
they
concluded
to
stop
there
is
no
denying
that
winslow
was
in
a
fearful
temper
just
then
with
evans
himself
nelly
in
fact
with
all
the
world
his
friends
drove
him
home
in
the
evening
on
their
way
to
the
station
and
dropped
him
at
the
beckwith
farm
at
dusk
he
went
moodily
down
to
the
shore
far
up
the
bend
was
dim
and
shadowy
and
stars
were
shining
above
the
wooded
shores
over
the
river
the
pennington
farmhouse
lights
twinkled
out
alluringly
winslow
watched
them
until
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
nelly
had
made
off
with
his
skiff
but
perry
beckwith
dory
was
ready
to
hand
in
five
minutes
winslow
was
grounding
her
on
the
west
shore
nelly
was
sitting
on
a
rock
at
the
landing
place
he
went
over
and
sat
down
silently
beside
her
a
full
moon
was
rising
above
the
dark
hills
up
the
bend
and
in
the
faint
light
the
girl
was
wonderfully
lovely
i
thought
you
were
comin
over
at
all
tonight
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
and
i
was
sorry
because
i
wanted
to
say
goodbye
to
you
goodbye
nelly
you
not
going
away

the
cats
were
in
the
pantry

minutes
before
winslow
gave
her
a
chance
to
say
anything
else

will
your
people
say
she
contrived
to
ask

a
dreadful
state
oh

said
winslow
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
i

bit
at
first
i
daresay
father

worry
over

nelly
i
not
afraid
of

i
not
afraid
of
anything
except

remarked
nelly
after
another
eloquent
interlude
he

or

see

where

he
he
is
in
town
at
the
arlington
the
arlington
winslow
was
amazed
the
arlington
was
the
most
exclusive
and
expensive
hotel
in
town
what
is
he
doing
there
transacting
a
real
estate
or
railroad
deal
with
your
father
i
believe
or
something
of
that
sort
nelly
well
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
winslow
got
up
and
looked
at
her
nelly
who
are
you
helen
ray
scott
at
your
service
sir
not
helen
ray
scott
the
daughter
of
the
railroad
king
the
same
are
you
sorry
that
you
engaged
to
her
if
you
are
she
stay
nelly
ray
winslow
dropped
back
on
the
seat
with
a
long
breath
nelly
i
do
understand
why
did
you
deceive
me
i
feel
stunned
oh
do
forgive
me
she
said
merrily
i
should
have
i
suppose
but
you
know
you
took
me
for
the
hired
girl
the
very
first
time
you
saw
me
and
you
patronized
me
and
called
me
nelly
so
i
let
you
think
so
just
for
fun
i
never
thought
it
would
come
to
this
when
father
and
i
came
north
i
took
a
fancy
to
come
here
and
stay
with
pennington
who
is
an
old
nurse
of
mine
until
father
decided
where
to
take
up
our
abode
i
got
here
the
night
before
we
met
my
trunk
was
delayed
so
i
put
on
an
old
cotton
dress
her
niece
had
left
here
and
you
came
and
saw
me
i
made
pennington
keep
the
secret
she
thought
it
great
fun
and
i
really
was
a
great
hand
to
do
little
chores
and
keep
the
cats
in
subjection
too
i
made
mistakes
in
grammar
and
dropped
my
g
on
purpose
it
was
such
fun
to
see
you
wince
when
i
did
it
it
was
cruel
to
tease
you
so
i
suppose
but
it
was
so
sweet
just
to
be
loved
for
myself
not
because
i
was
an
heiress
and
a
belle
i
could
bear
to
tell
you
the
truth
did
you
think
i
could
read
your
thoughts
this
afternoon
when
i
insisted
on
going
ashore
you
were
a
little
ashamed
of
me
you
know
you
were
i
blame
you
for
that
but
if
you
had
gone
ashore
and
taken
me
as
you
did
i
would
never
have
spoken
to
you
again
snub
me
next
time
we
meet
and
some
way
i
do
think
your
father
will
turn
you
out
either
have
you
forgiven
me
yet
burton
i
shall
never
call
you
anything
but
nelly
said
winslow
irrelevantly
the
red
room
you
would
have
me
tell
you
the
story
grandchild
is
a
sad
one
and
best
forgotten
few
remember
it
now
there
are
always
sad
and
dark
stories
in
old
families
such
as
ours
yet
i
have
promised
and
must
keep
my
word
so
sit
down
here
at
my
feet
and
rest
your
bright
head
on
my
lap
that
i
may
not
see
in
your
young
eyes
the
shadows
my
story
will
bring
across
their
bonny
blue
i
was
a
mere
child
when
it
all
happened
yet
i
remember
it
but
too
well
and
i
can
recall
how
pleased
i
was
when
my
father
stepmother
montressor
she
not
liking
to
be
called
grandmother
seeing
she
was
but
turned
of
fifty
and
a
handsome
woman
still
wrote
to
my
mother
that
she
must
send
little
beatrice
up
to
montressor
place
for
the
christmas
holidays
so
i
went
joyfully
though
my
mother
grieved
to
part
with
me
she
had
little
to
love
save
me
my
father
conrad
montressor
having
been
lost
at
sea
when
but
three
months
my
aunts
were
wont
to
tell
me
how
much
i
resembled
him
being
so
they
said
a
montressor
to
the
backbone
and
this
i
took
to
mean
commendation
for
the
montressors
were
a
and
family
and
the
women
were
noted
for
their
beauty
this
i
could
well
believe
since
of
all
my
aunts
there
was
not
one
but
was
counted
a
pretty
woman
therefore
i
took
heart
of
grace
when
i
thought
of
my
dark
face
and
spindling
shape
hoping
that
when
i
should
be
grown
up
i
might
be
counted
not
unworthy
of
my
race
the
place
was
an
mysterious
house
such
as
i
delighted
in
and
montressor
was
ever
kind
to
me
albeit
a
little
stern
for
she
was
a
proud
woman
and
cared
but
little
for
children
having
none
of
her
own
but
there
were
books
there
to
pore
over
without
let
or
hindrance
for
nobody
questioned
of
my
whereabouts
if
i
but
kept
out
of
the
way
and
strange
dim
family
portraits
on
the
walls
to
gaze
upon
until
i
knew
each
proud
old
face
well
and
had
visioned
a
history
for
it
in
my
own
mind
for
i
was
given
to
dreaming
and
was
older
and
wiser
than
my
years
having
no
childish
companions
to
keep
me
still
a
child
there
were
always
some
of
my
aunts
at
the
place
to
kiss
and
make
much
of
me
for
my
father
sake
for
he
had
been
their
favourite
brother
my
aunts
there
were
eight
of
them
had
all
married
well
so
said
people
who
knew
and
lived
not
far
away
coming
home
often
to
take
tea
with
montressor
who
had
always
gotten
on
well
with
her
or
to
help
prepare
for
some
festivity
or
other
for
they
were
notable
housekeepers
every
one
they
were
all
at
montressor
place
for
christmas
and
i
got
more
petting
than
i
deserved
albeit
they
looked
after
me
somewhat
more
strictly
than
did
montressor
and
saw
to
it
that
i
did
not
read
too
many
fairy
tales
or
sit
up
later
at
nights
than
became
my
years
but
it
was
not
for
fairy
tales
and
sugarplums
nor
yet
for
petting
that
i
rejoiced
to
be
at
the
place
at
that
time
though
i
spoke
not
of
it
to
anyone
i
had
a
great
longing
to
see
my
uncle
hugh
wife
concerning
whom
i
had
heard
much
both
good
and
bad
my
uncle
hugh
albeit
the
oldest
of
the
family
had
never
married
until
now
and
all
the
countryside
rang
with
talk
of
his
young
wife
i
did
not
hear
as
much
as
i
wished
for
the
gossips
took
heed
to
my
presence
when
i
drew
anear
and
turned
to
other
matters
yet
being
somewhat
keener
of
comprehension
than
they
knew
i
heard
and
understood
not
a
little
of
their
talk
and
so
i
came
to
know
that
neither
proud
montressor
nor
my
good
aunts
nor
even
my
gentle
mother
looked
with
overmuch
favour
on
what
my
uncle
hugh
had
done
and
i
did
hear
that
montressor
had
chosen
a
wife
for
her
stepson
of
good
family
and
some
beauty
but
that
my
uncle
hugh
would
have
none
of
her
a
thing
montressor
found
hard
to
pardon
yet
might
so
have
done
had
not
my
uncle
on
his
last
voyage
to
the
indies
for
he
went
often
in
his
own
vessels
married
and
brought
home
a
foreign
bride
of
whom
no
one
knew
aught
save
that
her
beauty
was
a
thing
to
dazzle
the
day
and
that
she
was
of
some
strange
alien
blood
such
as
ran
not
in
the
blue
veins
of
the
montressors
some
had
much
to
say
of
her
pride
and
insolence
and
wondered
if
montressor
would
tamely
yield
her
to
the
stranger
but
others
who
were
taken
with
her
loveliness
and
grace
said
that
the
tales
told
were
born
of
envy
and
malice
and
that
alicia
montressor
was
well
worthy
of
her
name
and
station
so
i
halted
between
two
opinions
and
thought
to
judge
for
myself
but
when
i
went
to
the
place
my
uncle
hugh
and
his
bride
were
gone
for
a
time
and
i
had
even
to
swallow
my
disappointment
and
bide
their
return
with
all
my
small
patience
but
my
aunts
and
their
stepmother
talked
much
of
alicia
and
they
spoke
slightingly
of
her
saying
that
she
was
but
a
light
woman
and
that
no
good
would
come
of
my
uncle
hugh
having
wed
her
with
other
things
of
a
like
nature
also
they
spoke
of
the
company
she
gathered
around
her
thinking
her
to
have
strange
and
unbecoming
companions
for
a
montressor
all
this
i
heard
and
pondered
much
over
although
my
good
aunts
supposed
that
such
a
chit
as
i
would
take
no
heed
to
their
whisperings
when
i
was
not
with
them
helping
to
whip
eggs
and
stone
raisins
and
being
watched
to
see
that
i
ate
not
more
than
one
out
of
five
i
was
surely
to
be
found
in
the
wing
hall
poring
over
my
book
and
grieving
that
i
was
no
more
allowed
to
go
into
the
red
room
the
wing
hall
was
a
narrow
one
and
dim
connecting
the
main
rooms
of
the
place
with
an
older
wing
built
in
a
curious
way
the
hall
was
lighted
by
small
windows
and
at
its
end
a
little
flight
of
steps
led
up
to
the
red
room
whenever
i
had
been
at
the
place
before
and
this
was
often
i
had
passed
much
of
my
time
in
this
same
red
room
it
was
then
where
she
wrote
her
letters
and
examined
household
accounts
and
sometimes
had
an
old
gossip
in
to
tea
the
room
was
and
dim
hung
with
red
damask
and
with
odd
square
windows
high
up
under
the
eaves
and
a
dark
wainscoting
all
around
it
and
there
i
loved
to
sit
quietly
on
the
red
sofa
and
read
my
fairy
tales
or
talk
dreamily
to
the
swallows
fluttering
crazily
against
the
tiny
panes
when
i
had
gone
this
christmas
to
the
place
i
soon
bethought
myself
of
the
red
room
for
i
had
a
great
love
for
it
but
i
had
got
no
further
than
the
steps
when
montressor
came
sweeping
down
the
hall
in
haste
and
catching
me
by
the
arm
pulled
me
back
as
roughly
as
if
it
had
been
bluebeard
chamber
itself
into
which
i
was
venturing
then
seeing
my
face
which
i
doubt
not
was
startled
enough
she
seemed
to
repent
of
her
haste
and
patted
me
gently
on
the
head
there
there
little
beatrice
did
i
frighten
you
child
forgive
an
old
woman
thoughtlessness
but
be
not
too
ready
to
go
where
you
are
not
bidden
and
never
venture
foot
in
the
red
room
now
for
it
belongs
to
your
uncle
hugh
wife
and
let
me
tell
you
she
is
not
over
fond
of
intruders
i
felt
sorry
overmuch
to
hear
this
nor
could
i
see
why
my
new
aunt
should
care
if
i
went
in
once
in
a
while
as
had
been
my
habit
to
talk
to
the
swallows
and
misplace
nothing
but
montressor
saw
to
it
that
i
obeyed
her
and
i
went
no
more
to
the
red
room
but
busied
myself
with
other
matters
for
there
were
great
doings
at
the
place
and
much
coming
and
going
my
aunts
were
never
idle
there
was
to
be
much
festivity
christmas
week
and
a
ball
on
christmas
eve
and
my
aunts
had
promised
me
though
not
till
i
had
wearied
them
of
my
coaxing
that
i
should
stay
up
that
night
and
see
as
much
of
the
gaiety
as
was
good
for
me
so
i
did
their
errands
and
went
early
to
bed
every
night
without
complaint
though
i
did
this
the
more
readily
for
that
when
they
thought
me
safely
asleep
they
would
come
in
and
talk
around
my
bedroom
fire
saying
that
of
alicia
which
i
should
not
have
heard
at
last
came
the
day
when
my
uncle
hugh
and
his
wife
were
expected
home
though
not
until
my
scanty
patience
was
well
nigh
wearied
out
and
we
were
all
assembled
to
meet
them
in
the
great
hall
where
a
ruddy
firelight
was
gleaming
my
aunt
frances
had
dressed
me
in
my
best
white
frock
and
my
crimson
sash
with
much
lamenting
over
my
skinny
neck
and
arms
and
bade
me
behave
prettily
as
became
my
bringing
up
so
i
slipped
in
a
corner
my
hands
and
feet
cold
with
excitement
for
i
think
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
had
gone
to
my
head
and
my
heart
beat
so
hardly
that
it
even
pained
me
then
the
door
opened
and
alicia
for
so
i
was
used
to
hearing
her
called
nor
did
i
ever
think
of
her
as
my
aunt
in
my
own
mind
came
in
and
a
little
in
the
rear
my
tall
dark
uncle
she
came
proudly
forward
to
the
fire
and
stood
there
superbly
while
she
loosened
her
cloak
nor
did
she
see
me
at
all
at
first
but
nodded
a
little
disdainfully
it
seemed
to
montressor
and
my
aunts
who
were
grouped
about
the
door
very
ladylike
and
quiet
but
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
aught
at
the
time
save
her
only
for
her
beauty
when
she
came
forth
from
her
crimson
cloak
and
hood
was
something
so
wonderful
that
i
forgot
my
manners
and
stared
at
her
as
one
fascinated
as
indeed
i
was
for
never
had
i
seen
such
loveliness
and
hardly
dreamed
it
pretty
women
i
had
seen
in
plenty
for
my
aunts
and
my
mother
were
counted
fair
but
my
uncle
wife
was
as
little
like
to
them
as
a
sunset
glow
to
pale
moonshine
or
a
crimson
rose
to
white
nor
can
i
paint
her
to
you
in
words
as
i
saw
her
then
with
the
long
tongues
of
firelight
licking
her
white
neck
and
wavering
over
the
rich
masses
of
her
hair
she
was
tall
so
tall
that
my
aunts
looked
but
insignificant
beside
her
and
they
were
of
no
mean
height
as
became
their
race
yet
no
queen
could
have
carried
herself
more
royally
and
all
the
passion
and
fire
of
her
foreign
nature
burned
in
her
splendid
eyes
that
might
have
been
dark
or
light
for
aught
that
i
could
ever
tell
but
which
seemed
always
like
pools
of
warm
flame
now
tender
now
fierce
her
skin
was
like
a
delicate
white
rose
leaf
and
when
she
spoke
i
told
my
foolish
self
that
never
had
i
heard
music
before
nor
do
i
ever
again
think
to
hear
a
voice
so
sweet
so
liquid
as
that
which
rippled
over
her
ripe
lips
i
had
often
in
my
own
mind
pictured
this
my
first
meeting
with
alicia
now
in
one
way
now
in
another
but
never
had
i
dreamed
of
her
speaking
to
me
at
all
so
that
it
came
to
me
as
a
great
surprise
when
she
turned
and
holding
out
her
lovely
hands
said
very
graciously
and
is
this
the
little
beatrice
i
have
heard
much
of
you
come
kiss
me
child
and
i
went
despite
my
aunt
elizabeth
black
frown
for
the
glamour
of
her
loveliness
was
upon
me
and
i
no
longer
wondered
that
my
uncle
hugh
should
have
loved
her
very
proud
of
her
was
he
too
yet
i
felt
rather
than
saw
for
i
was
sensitive
and
quick
of
perception
as
children
ever
are
that
there
was
something
other
than
pride
and
love
in
his
face
when
he
looked
on
her
and
more
in
his
manner
than
the
fond
lover
as
it
were
a
sort
of
lurking
mistrust
nor
could
i
think
though
to
me
the
thought
seemed
as
treason
that
she
loved
her
husband
overmuch
for
she
seemed
half
condescending
and
half
disdainful
to
him
yet
one
thought
not
of
this
in
her
presence
but
only
remembered
it
when
she
had
gone
when
she
went
out
it
seemed
to
me
that
nothing
was
left
so
i
crept
lonesomely
away
to
the
wing
hall
and
sat
down
by
a
window
to
dream
of
her
and
she
filled
my
thoughts
so
fully
that
it
was
no
surprise
when
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
her
coming
down
the
hall
alone
her
bright
head
shining
against
the
dark
old
walls
when
she
paused
by
me
and
asked
me
lightly
of
what
i
was
dreaming
since
i
had
such
a
sober
face
i
answered
her
truly
that
it
was
of
her
whereat
she
laughed
as
one
not
ill
pleased
and
said
half
mockingly
waste
not
your
thoughts
so
little
beatrice
but
come
with
me
child
if
you
will
for
i
have
taken
a
strange
fancy
to
your
solemn
eyes
perchance
the
warmth
of
your
young
life
may
thaw
out
the
ice
that
has
frozen
around
my
heart
ever
since
i
came
among
these
cold
montressors
and
though
i
understood
not
her
meaning
i
went
glad
to
see
the
red
room
once
more
so
she
made
me
sit
down
and
talk
to
her
which
i
did
for
shyness
was
no
failing
of
mine
and
she
asked
me
many
questions
and
some
that
i
thought
she
should
not
have
asked
but
i
could
not
answer
them
so
little
harm
after
that
i
spent
a
part
of
every
day
with
her
in
the
red
room
and
my
uncle
hugh
was
there
often
and
he
would
kiss
her
and
praise
her
loveliness
not
heeding
my
presence
for
i
was
but
a
child
yet
it
ever
seemed
to
me
that
she
endured
rather
than
welcomed
his
caresses
and
at
times
the
flame
in
her
eyes
glowed
so
luridly
that
a
chill
dread
would
creep
over
me
and
i
would
remember
what
my
aunt
elizabeth
had
said
she
being
a
woman
though
kind
at
heart
that
this
strange
creature
would
bring
on
us
all
some
evil
fortune
yet
then
would
i
strive
to
banish
such
thoughts
and
chide
myself
for
doubting
one
so
kind
to
me
when
christmas
eve
drew
nigh
my
silly
head
was
full
of
the
ball
day
and
night
but
a
grievous
disappointment
befell
me
for
i
awakened
that
day
very
ill
with
a
most
severe
cold
and
though
i
bore
me
bravely
my
aunts
discovered
it
soon
when
despite
my
piteous
pleadings
i
was
put
to
bed
where
i
cried
bitterly
and
would
not
be
comforted
for
i
thought
i
should
not
see
the
fine
folk
and
more
than
all
alicia
but
that
disappointment
at
least
was
spared
me
for
at
night
she
came
into
my
room
knowing
of
my
longing
she
was
ever
indulgent
to
my
little
wishes
and
when
i
saw
her
i
forgot
my
aching
limbs
and
burning
brow
and
even
the
ball
i
was
not
to
see
for
never
was
mortal
creature
so
lovely
as
she
standing
there
by
my
bed
her
gown
was
of
white
and
there
was
nothing
i
could
liken
the
stuff
to
save
moonshine
falling
athwart
a
frosted
pane
and
out
from
it
swelled
her
gleaming
breast
and
arms
so
bare
that
it
seemed
to
me
a
shame
to
look
upon
them
yet
it
could
not
be
denied
they
were
of
wondrous
beauty
white
as
polished
marble
and
all
about
her
snowy
throat
and
rounded
arms
and
in
the
masses
of
her
splendid
hair
were
sparkling
gleaming
stones
with
hearts
of
pure
light
which
i
know
now
to
have
been
diamonds
but
knew
not
then
for
never
had
i
seen
aught
of
their
like
and
i
gazed
at
her
drinking
in
her
beauty
until
my
soul
was
filled
as
she
stood
like
some
goddess
before
her
worshipper
i
think
she
read
my
thought
in
my
face
and
liked
it
for
she
was
a
vain
woman
and
to
such
even
the
admiration
of
a
child
is
sweet
then
she
leaned
down
to
me
until
her
splendid
eyes
looked
straight
into
my
dazzled
ones
tell
me
little
beatrice
for
they
say
the
word
of
a
child
is
to
be
believed
tell
me
do
you
think
me
beautiful
i
found
my
voice
and
told
her
truly
that
i
thought
her
beautiful
beyond
my
dreams
of
angels
as
indeed
she
was
whereat
she
smiled
as
one
well
pleased
then
my
uncle
hugh
came
in
and
though
i
thought
that
his
face
darkened
as
he
looked
on
the
naked
splendour
of
her
breast
and
arms
as
if
he
liked
not
that
the
eyes
of
other
men
should
gloat
on
it
yet
he
kissed
her
with
all
a
lover
fond
pride
while
she
looked
at
him
half
mockingly
then
said
he
sweet
will
you
grant
me
a
favour
and
she
answered
it
may
be
that
i
will
and
he
said
do
not
dance
with
that
man
tonight
alicia
i
mistrust
him
much
his
voice
had
more
of
a
husband
command
than
a
lover
entreaty
she
looked
at
him
with
some
scorn
but
when
she
saw
his
face
grow
black
for
the
montressors
brooked
scant
disregard
of
their
authority
as
i
had
good
reason
to
know
she
seemed
to
change
and
a
smile
came
to
her
lips
though
her
eyes
glowed
balefully
then
she
laid
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
though
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
as
soon
strangled
as
embraced
him
her
voice
was
wondrous
sweet
and
caressing
as
she
murmured
in
his
ear
he
laughed
and
his
brow
cleared
though
he
said
still
sternly
do
not
try
me
too
far
alicia
then
they
went
out
she
a
little
in
advance
and
very
stately
after
that
my
aunts
also
came
in
very
beautifully
and
modestly
dressed
but
they
seemed
to
me
as
nothing
after
alicia
for
i
was
caught
in
the
snare
of
her
beauty
and
the
longing
to
see
her
again
so
grew
upon
me
that
after
a
time
i
did
an
undutiful
and
disobedient
thing
i
had
been
straitly
charged
to
stay
in
bed
which
i
did
not
but
got
up
and
put
on
a
gown
for
it
was
in
my
mind
to
go
quietly
down
if
by
chance
i
might
again
see
alicia
myself
unseen
but
when
i
reached
the
great
hall
i
heard
steps
approaching
and
having
a
guilty
conscience
i
slipped
aside
into
the
blue
parlour
and
hid
me
behind
the
curtains
lest
my
aunts
should
see
me
then
alicia
came
in
and
with
her
a
man
whom
i
had
never
before
seen
yet
i
instantly
bethought
myself
of
a
lean
black
snake
with
a
glittering
and
evil
eye
which
i
had
seen
in
montressor
garden
two
summers
agone
and
which
was
like
to
have
bitten
me
john
the
gardener
had
killed
it
and
i
verily
thought
that
if
it
had
a
soul
it
must
have
gotten
into
this
man
alicia
sat
down
and
he
beside
her
and
when
he
had
put
his
arms
about
her
he
kissed
her
face
and
lips
nor
did
she
shrink
from
his
embrace
but
even
smiled
and
leaned
nearer
to
him
with
a
little
smooth
motion
as
they
talked
to
each
other
in
some
strange
foreign
tongue
i
was
but
a
child
and
innocent
nor
knew
i
aught
of
honour
and
dishonour
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
man
should
kiss
her
save
only
my
uncle
hugh
and
from
that
hour
i
mistrusted
alicia
though
i
understood
not
then
what
i
afterwards
did
and
as
i
watched
them
not
thinking
of
playing
the
spy
i
saw
her
face
grow
suddenly
cold
and
she
straightened
herself
up
and
pushed
away
her
lover
arms
then
i
followed
her
guilty
eyes
to
the
door
where
stood
my
uncle
hugh
and
all
the
pride
and
passion
of
the
montressors
sat
on
his
lowering
brow
yet
he
came
forward
quietly
as
alicia
and
the
snake
drew
apart
and
stood
up
at
first
he
looked
not
at
his
guilty
wife
but
at
her
lover
and
smote
him
heavily
in
the
face
whereat
he
being
a
coward
at
heart
as
are
all
villains
turned
white
and
slunk
from
the
room
with
a
muttered
oath
nor
was
he
stayed
my
uncle
turned
to
alicia
and
very
calmly
and
terribly
he
said
from
this
hour
you
are
no
longer
wife
of
mine
and
there
was
that
in
his
tone
which
told
that
his
forgiveness
and
love
should
be
hers
nevermore
then
he
motioned
her
out
and
she
went
like
a
proud
queen
with
her
glorious
head
erect
and
no
shame
on
her
brow
as
for
me
when
they
were
gone
i
crept
away
dazed
and
bewildered
enough
and
went
back
to
my
bed
having
seen
and
heard
more
than
i
had
a
mind
for
as
disobedient
people
and
eavesdroppers
ever
do
but
my
uncle
hugh
kept
his
word
and
alicia
was
no
more
wife
to
him
save
only
in
name
yet
of
gossip
or
scandal
there
was
none
for
the
pride
of
his
race
kept
secret
his
dishonour
nor
did
he
ever
seem
other
than
a
courteous
and
respectful
husband
nor
did
montressor
and
my
aunts
though
they
wondered
much
among
themselves
learn
aught
for
they
dared
question
neither
their
brother
nor
alicia
who
carried
herself
as
loftily
as
ever
and
seemed
to
pine
for
neither
lover
nor
husband
as
for
me
no
one
dreamed
i
knew
aught
of
it
and
i
kept
my
own
counsel
as
to
what
i
had
seen
in
the
blue
parlour
on
the
night
of
the
christmas
ball
after
the
new
year
i
went
home
but
ere
long
montressor
sent
for
me
again
saying
that
the
house
was
lonely
without
little
beatrice
so
i
went
again
and
found
all
unchanged
though
the
place
was
very
quiet
and
alicia
went
out
but
little
from
the
red
room
of
my
uncle
hugh
i
saw
little
save
when
he
went
and
came
on
the
business
of
his
estate
somewhat
more
gravely
and
silently
than
of
yore
or
brought
to
me
books
and
sweetmeats
from
town
but
every
day
i
was
with
alicia
in
the
red
room
where
she
would
talk
to
me
oftentimes
wildly
and
strangely
but
always
kindly
and
though
i
think
montressor
liked
our
intimacy
none
too
well
she
said
no
word
and
i
came
and
went
as
i
listed
with
alicia
though
never
quite
liking
her
strange
ways
and
the
restless
fire
in
her
eyes
nor
would
i
ever
kiss
her
after
i
had
seen
her
lips
pressed
by
the
snake
though
she
sometimes
coaxed
me
and
grew
pettish
and
vexed
when
i
would
not
but
she
guessed
not
my
reason
march
came
in
that
year
like
a
lion
exceedingly
hungry
and
fierce
and
my
uncle
hugh
had
ridden
away
through
the
storm
nor
thought
to
be
back
for
some
days
in
the
afternoon
i
was
sitting
in
the
wing
hall
dreaming
wondrous
when
alicia
called
me
to
the
red
room
and
as
i
went
i
marvelled
anew
at
her
loveliness
for
the
blood
was
leaping
in
her
face
and
her
jewels
were
dim
before
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
her
hand
when
she
took
mine
was
burning
hot
and
her
voice
had
a
strange
ring
come
little
beatrice
she
said
come
talk
to
me
for
i
know
not
what
to
do
with
my
lone
self
today
time
hangs
heavily
in
this
gloomy
house
i
do
verily
think
this
red
room
has
an
evil
influence
over
me
see
if
your
childish
prattle
can
drive
away
the
ghosts
that
riot
in
these
dark
old
corners
ghosts
of
a
ruined
and
shamed
life
nay
shrink
not
do
i
talk
wildly
i
mean
not
all
i
say
my
brain
seems
on
fire
little
beatrice
come
it
may
be
you
know
some
grim
old
legend
of
this
room
it
must
surely
have
one
never
was
place
fitter
for
a
dark
deed
tush
never
be
so
frightened
child
forget
my
vagaries
tell
me
now
and
i
will
listen
whereat
she
cast
herself
lithely
on
the
satin
couch
and
turned
her
lovely
face
on
me
so
i
gathered
up
my
small
wits
and
told
her
what
i
was
not
supposed
to
know
how
that
generations
agone
a
montressor
had
disgraced
himself
and
his
name
and
that
when
he
came
home
to
his
mother
she
had
met
him
in
that
same
red
room
and
flung
at
him
taunts
and
reproaches
forgetting
whose
breast
had
nourished
him
and
that
he
frantic
with
shame
and
despair
turned
his
sword
against
his
own
heart
and
so
died
but
his
mother
went
mad
with
her
remorse
and
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
the
red
room
until
her
death
so
lamely
told
i
the
tale
as
i
had
heard
my
aunt
elizabeth
tell
it
when
she
knew
not
i
listened
or
understood
alicia
heard
me
through
and
said
nothing
save
that
it
was
a
tale
worthy
of
the
montressors
whereat
i
bridled
for
i
too
was
a
montressor
and
proud
of
it
but
she
took
my
hand
soothingly
in
hers
and
said
little
beatrice
if
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
they
should
tell
you
those
cold
proud
women
that
alicia
was
unworthy
of
your
love
tell
me
would
you
believe
them
and
i
remembering
what
i
had
seen
in
the
blue
parlour
was
silent
for
i
could
not
lie
so
she
flung
my
hand
away
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
picked
lightly
from
the
table
anear
a
small
dagger
with
a
jewelled
handle
it
seemed
to
me
a
toy
and
i
said
so
whereat
she
smiled
and
drew
her
white
fingers
down
the
thin
shining
blade
in
a
fashion
that
made
me
cold
such
a
little
blow
with
this
she
said
such
a
little
blow
and
the
heart
beats
no
longer
the
weary
brain
rests
the
lips
and
eyes
smile
never
again
a
short
path
out
of
all
difficulties
my
beatrice
and
i
understanding
her
not
yet
shivering
begged
her
to
cast
it
aside
which
she
did
carelessly
and
putting
a
hand
under
my
chin
she
turned
up
my
face
to
hers
little
beatrice
tell
me
truly
would
it
grieve
you
much
if
you
were
never
again
to
sit
here
with
alicia
in
this
same
red
room
and
i
made
answer
earnestly
that
it
would
glad
that
i
could
say
so
much
truly
then
her
face
grew
tender
and
she
sighed
deeply
presently
she
opened
a
quaint
inlaid
box
and
took
from
it
a
shining
gold
chain
of
rare
workmanship
and
exquisite
design
and
this
she
hung
around
my
neck
nor
would
suffer
me
to
thank
her
but
laid
her
hand
gently
on
my
lips
now
go
she
said
but
ere
you
leave
me
little
beatrice
grant
me
but
the
one
favour
it
may
be
that
i
shall
never
ask
another
of
you
your
people
i
know
those
cold
montressors
care
little
for
me
but
with
all
my
faults
i
have
ever
been
kind
to
you
so
when
the
morrow
come
and
they
tell
you
that
alicia
is
as
one
worse
than
dead
think
not
of
me
with
scorn
only
but
grant
me
a
little
pity
for
i
was
not
always
what
i
am
now
and
might
never
have
become
so
had
a
little
child
like
you
been
always
anear
me
to
keep
me
pure
and
innocent
and
i
would
have
you
but
the
once
lay
your
arms
about
my
neck
and
kiss
me
and
i
did
so
wondering
much
at
her
manner
for
it
had
in
it
a
strange
tenderness
and
some
sort
of
hopeless
longing
then
she
gently
put
me
from
the
room
and
i
sat
musing
by
the
hall
window
until
night
fell
darkly
and
a
fearsome
night
it
was
of
storm
and
blackness
and
i
thought
how
well
it
was
that
my
uncle
hugh
had
not
to
return
in
such
a
tempest
yet
ere
the
thought
had
grown
cold
the
door
opened
and
he
strode
down
the
hall
his
cloak
drenched
and
in
one
hand
a
whip
as
though
he
had
but
then
sprung
from
his
horse
in
the
other
what
seemed
like
a
crumpled
letter
nor
was
the
night
blacker
than
his
face
and
he
took
no
heed
of
me
as
i
ran
after
him
thinking
selfishly
of
the
sweetmeats
he
had
promised
to
bring
me
but
i
thought
no
more
of
them
when
i
got
to
the
door
of
the
red
room
alicia
stood
by
the
table
hooded
and
cloaked
as
for
a
journey
but
her
hood
had
slipped
back
and
her
face
rose
from
it
save
where
her
wrathful
eyes
burned
out
with
dread
and
guilt
and
hatred
in
their
depths
while
she
had
one
arm
raised
as
if
to
thrust
him
back
as
for
my
uncle
he
stood
before
her
and
i
saw
not
his
face
but
his
voice
was
low
and
terrible
speaking
words
i
understood
not
then
though
long
afterwards
i
came
to
know
their
meaning
and
he
cast
foul
scorn
at
her
that
she
should
have
thought
to
fly
with
her
lover
and
swore
that
naught
should
again
thwart
his
vengeance
with
other
threats
wild
and
dreadful
enough
yet
she
said
no
word
until
he
had
done
and
then
she
spoke
but
what
she
said
i
know
not
save
that
it
was
full
of
hatred
and
defiance
and
wild
accusation
such
as
a
mad
woman
might
have
uttered
and
she
defied
him
even
then
to
stop
her
flight
though
he
told
her
to
cross
that
threshold
would
mean
her
death
for
he
was
a
wronged
and
desperate
man
and
thought
of
nothing
save
his
own
dishonour
then
she
made
as
if
to
pass
him
but
he
caught
her
by
her
white
wrist
she
turned
on
him
with
fury
and
i
saw
her
right
hand
reach
stealthily
out
over
the
table
behind
her
where
lay
the
dagger
let
me
go
she
hissed
and
he
said
i
will
not
then
she
turned
herself
about
and
struck
at
him
with
the
dagger
and
never
saw
i
such
a
face
as
was
hers
at
the
moment
he
fell
heavily
yet
held
her
even
in
death
so
that
she
had
to
wrench
herself
free
with
a
shriek
that
rings
yet
in
my
ears
on
a
night
when
the
wind
wails
over
the
rainy
moors
she
rushed
past
me
unheeding
and
fled
down
the
hall
like
a
hunted
creature
and
i
heard
the
heavy
door
clang
hollowly
behind
her
as
for
me
i
stood
there
looking
at
the
dead
man
for
i
could
neither
move
nor
speak
and
was
like
to
have
died
of
horror
and
presently
i
knew
nothing
nor
did
i
come
to
my
recollection
for
many
a
day
when
i
lay
abed
sick
of
a
fever
and
more
like
to
die
than
live
so
that
when
at
last
i
came
out
from
the
shadow
of
death
my
uncle
hugh
had
been
long
cold
in
his
grave
and
the
hue
and
cry
for
his
guilty
wife
was
well
nigh
over
since
naught
had
been
seen
or
heard
of
her
since
she
fled
the
country
with
her
foreign
lover
when
i
came
rightly
to
my
remembrance
they
questioned
me
as
to
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
the
red
room
and
i
told
them
as
best
i
could
though
much
aggrieved
that
to
my
questions
they
would
answer
nothing
save
to
bid
me
to
stay
still
and
think
not
of
the
matter
then
my
mother
sorely
vexed
over
my
adventures
which
in
truth
were
but
sorry
ones
for
a
child
took
me
home
nor
would
she
let
me
keep
alicia
chain
but
made
away
with
it
how
i
knew
not
and
little
cared
for
the
sight
of
it
was
loathsome
to
me
it
was
many
years
ere
i
went
again
to
montressor
place
and
i
never
saw
the
red
room
more
for
montressor
had
the
old
wing
torn
down
deeming
its
sorrowful
memories
dark
heritage
enough
for
the
next
montressor
so
grandchild
the
sad
tale
is
ended
and
you
will
not
see
the
red
room
when
you
go
next
month
to
montressor
place
the
swallows
still
build
under
the
eaves
though
i
know
not
if
you
will
understand
their
speech
as
i
did
the
setness
of
theodosia
when
theodosia
ford
married
wesley
brooke
after
a
courtship
of
three
years
everybody
concerned
was
satisfied
there
was
nothing
particularly
romantic
in
either
the
courtship
or
marriage
wesley
was
a
steady
rather
slow
fellow
comfortably
off
he
was
not
at
all
handsome
but
theodosia
was
a
very
pretty
girl
with
the
milky
colouring
of
an
auburn
blonde
and
large
eyes
she
looked
mild
and
and
was
known
to
be
wesley
older
brother
irving
brooke
had
married
a
woman
who
kept
him
in
hot
water
all
the
time
so
heatherton
folks
said
but
they
thought
there
was
no
fear
of
that
with
wesley
and
theodosia
they
would
get
along
together
all
right
only
old
jim
parmelee
shook
his
head
and
said
they
might
and
then
again
they
might
he
knew
the
stock
they
came
of
and
it
was
a
kind
you
could
never
predict
about
wesley
and
theodosia
were
third
cousins
this
meant
that
old
henry
ford
had
been
the
of
them
both
jim
parmelee
who
was
ninety
had
been
a
small
boy
when
this
remote
ancestor
was
still
alive
i
mind
him
well
said
old
jim
on
the
morning
of
theodosia
wedding
day
there
was
a
little
group
about
the
blacksmith
forge
old
jim
was
in
the
centre
he
was
a
fat
old
man
fresh
and
ruddy
in
spite
of
his
ninety
years
and
he
went
on
he
was
about
the
settest
man
you
ever
see
or
want
to
see
when
old
henry
ford
made
up
his
mind
on
any
a
cyclone
would
turn
him
a
hairsbreadth
no
nor
an
earthquake
neither
did
matter
a
mite
how
much
he
suffered
for
it
he
stick
to
it
if
it
broke
his
heart
there
was
always
some
story
or
other
going
round
about
old
henry
setness
the
family
were
quite
so
bad
only
tom
he
was
and
a
regular
chip
of
the
old
block
since
then
it
cropped
out
now
and
again
all
through
the
different
branches
of
the
family
i
mistrust
if
dosia
has
got
a
spice
of
it
and
wes
brooke
too
but
mebbe
not
old
jim
was
the
only
croaker
wesley
and
theodosia
were
married
in
the
golden
prime
of
the
indian
summer
and
settled
down
on
their
snug
little
farm
dosia
was
a
beautiful
bride
and
wesley
pride
in
her
was
amusingly
apparent
he
thought
nothing
too
good
for
her
the
heatherton
people
said
it
was
a
sight
to
make
an
old
heart
young
to
see
him
march
up
the
aisle
of
the
church
on
sunday
in
all
the
glossy
splendour
of
his
wedding
suit
his
curly
black
head
held
high
and
his
round
boyish
face
shining
with
happiness
stopping
and
turning
proudly
at
his
pew
to
show
theodosia
in
they
always
sat
alone
together
in
the
big
pew
and
alma
spencer
who
sat
behind
them
declared
that
they
held
each
other
hands
all
through
the
service
this
lasted
until
spring
then
came
a
sensation
and
scandal
such
as
decorous
heatherton
had
not
known
since
the
time
isaac
allen
got
drunk
at
centreville
fair
and
came
home
and
kicked
his
wife
one
evening
in
early
april
wesley
came
home
from
the
store
at
the
corner
where
he
had
lingered
to
talk
over
politics
and
farming
methods
with
his
cronies
this
evening
he
was
later
than
usual
and
theodosia
had
his
supper
kept
warm
for
him
she
met
him
on
the
porch
and
kissed
him
he
kissed
her
in
return
and
held
her
to
him
for
a
minute
with
her
bright
head
on
his
shoulder
the
frogs
were
singing
down
in
the
south
meadow
swamp
and
there
was
a
splendour
of
silvery
moonrise
over
the
wooded
heatherton
hills
theodosia
always
remembered
that
moment
when
they
went
in
wesley
full
of
excitement
began
to
talk
of
what
he
had
heard
at
the
store
ogden
greene
and
tom
cary
were
going
to
sell
out
and
go
to
manitoba
there
were
better
chances
for
a
man
out
there
he
said
in
heatherton
he
might
slave
all
his
life
and
never
make
more
than
a
bare
living
out
west
he
might
make
a
fortune
wesley
talked
on
in
this
strain
for
some
time
rehashing
all
the
arguments
he
had
heard
greene
and
cary
use
he
had
always
been
rather
disposed
to
grumble
at
his
limited
chances
in
heatherton
and
now
the
great
west
seemed
to
stretch
before
him
full
of
alluring
prospects
and
visions
ogden
and
tom
wanted
him
to
go
too
he
said
he
had
half
a
notion
to
heatherton
was
a
sort
of
place
anyhow
what
say
dosia
he
looked
across
the
table
at
her
his
eyes
bright
and
questioning
theodosia
had
listened
in
silence
as
she
poured
his
tea
and
passed
him
her
hot
flaky
biscuits
there
was
a
little
perpendicular
wrinkle
between
her
straight
eyebrows
i
think
ogden
and
tom
are
fools
she
said
crisply
they
have
good
farms
here
what
do
they
want
to
go
west
for
or
you
either
get
silly
notions
in
your
head
wes
wesley
flushed
would
you
go
with
me
dosia
he
said
trying
to
speak
lightly
no
i
would
said
theodosia
in
her
calm
sweet
voice
her
face
was
serene
but
the
little
wrinkle
had
grown
deeper
old
jim
parmelee
would
have
known
what
it
meant
he
had
seen
the
same
expression
on
old
henry
ford
face
many
a
time
wesley
laughed
as
if
at
a
child
his
heart
was
suddenly
set
on
going
west
and
he
was
sure
he
could
soon
bring
theodosia
around
he
did
not
say
anything
more
about
it
just
then
wesley
thought
he
knew
how
to
manage
women
when
he
broached
the
subject
again
two
days
later
theodosia
told
him
plainly
that
it
was
no
use
she
would
never
consent
to
leave
heatherton
and
all
her
friends
and
go
out
to
the
prairies
the
idea
was
just
rank
foolishness
and
he
would
soon
see
that
himself
all
this
theodosia
said
calmly
and
sweetly
without
any
trace
of
temper
or
irritation
wesley
still
believed
that
he
could
persuade
her
and
he
tried
perseveringly
for
a
fortnight
by
the
end
of
that
time
he
discovered
that
theodosia
was
not
a
of
old
henry
ford
for
nothing
not
that
theodosia
ever
got
angry
neither
did
she
laugh
at
him
she
met
his
arguments
and
pleadings
seriously
enough
but
she
never
wavered
if
you
go
to
manitoba
wes
you
go
alone
she
said
i
never
go
so
there
is
no
use
in
any
more
talking
wesley
was
a
descendant
of
old
henry
ford
too
theodosia
unexpected
opposition
roused
all
the
latent
stubbornness
of
his
nature
he
went
over
to
centreville
oftener
and
kept
his
blood
at
fever
heat
talking
to
greene
and
cary
who
wanted
him
to
go
with
them
and
spared
no
pains
at
inducement
the
matter
was
gossiped
about
in
heatherton
of
course
people
knew
that
wesley
brooke
had
caught
the
western
fever
and
wanted
to
sell
out
and
go
to
manitoba
while
theodosia
was
opposed
to
it
they
thought
dosia
would
have
to
give
in
in
the
end
but
said
it
was
a
pity
wes
brooke
could
be
contented
to
stay
where
he
was
well
off
theodosia
family
naturally
sided
with
her
and
tried
to
dissuade
wesley
but
he
was
mastered
by
that
resentful
irritation
roused
in
a
man
by
opposition
where
he
thinks
he
should
be
master
which
will
drive
him
into
any
cause
one
day
he
told
theodosia
that
he
was
going
she
was
working
her
butter
in
her
little
dairy
under
the
great
willows
by
the
well
wesley
was
standing
in
the
doorway
his
stout
figure
filling
up
the
sunlit
space
he
was
frowning
and
sullen
i
going
west
in
two
weeks
time
with
the
boys
dosia
he
said
stubbornly
you
can
come
with
me
or
stay
here
just
exactly
as
you
please
but
i
going
theodosia
went
on
spatting
her
balls
of
golden
butter
on
the
print
in
silence
she
was
looking
very
neat
and
pretty
in
her
big
white
apron
her
sleeves
rolled
up
high
above
her
plump
dimpled
elbows
and
her
ruddy
hair
curling
about
her
face
and
her
white
throat
she
looked
as
pliable
as
her
butter
her
silence
angered
her
husband
he
shuffled
impatiently
well
what
have
you
to
say
dosia
nothing
said
theodosia
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
go
go
you
will
i
suppose
but
i
will
not
there
is
no
use
in
talking
been
over
the
ground
often
enough
wes
the
matter
is
settled
up
to
that
moment
wesley
had
always
believed
that
his
wife
would
yield
at
last
when
she
saw
that
he
was
determined
now
he
realized
that
she
never
would
under
that
exterior
of
milky
dimpled
flesh
and
calm
blue
eyes
was
all
the
iron
will
of
old
dead
and
forgotten
henry
ford
this
mildest
and
meekest
of
girls
and
wives
was
not
to
be
moved
a
hairsbreadth
by
all
argument
or
entreaty
or
insistence
on
a
rights
a
great
sudden
anger
came
over
the
man
he
lifted
his
hand
and
for
one
moment
it
seemed
to
theodosia
as
if
he
meant
to
strike
her
then
he
dropped
it
with
the
first
oath
that
had
ever
crossed
his
lips
you
listen
to
me
he
said
thickly
if
you
wo
go
with
me
never
come
back
here
never
when
you
want
to
do
your
duty
as
a
wife
you
can
come
to
me
but
i
never
come
back
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
away
theodosia
kept
on
spatting
her
butter
the
little
perpendicular
wrinkle
had
come
between
her
brows
again
at
that
moment
an
odd
almost
uncanny
resemblance
to
the
old
portrait
of
her
which
hung
on
the
parlour
wall
at
home
came
out
on
her
girlish
face
the
fortnight
passed
by
wesley
was
silent
and
sullen
never
speaking
to
his
wife
when
he
could
avoid
it
theodosia
was
as
sweet
and
serene
as
ever
she
made
an
extra
supply
of
shirts
and
socks
for
him
put
up
his
lunch
basket
and
packed
his
trunk
carefully
but
she
never
spoke
of
his
journey
he
did
not
sell
his
farm
irving
brooke
rented
it
theodosia
was
to
live
in
the
house
the
business
arrangements
were
simple
and
soon
concluded
heatherton
folks
gossiped
a
great
deal
they
all
condemned
theodosia
even
her
own
people
sided
against
her
now
they
hated
to
be
mixed
up
in
a
local
scandal
and
since
wes
was
bound
to
go
they
told
theodosia
that
it
was
her
duty
to
go
with
him
no
matter
how
much
she
disliked
it
it
would
be
disgraceful
not
to
they
might
as
well
have
talked
to
the
four
winds
theodosia
was
immoveable
they
coaxed
and
argued
and
blamed
it
all
came
to
the
same
thing
even
those
of
them
who
could
be
set
enough
themselves
on
occasion
could
not
understand
theodosia
who
had
always
been
so
tractable
they
finally
gave
up
as
wesley
had
done
baffled
time
would
bring
her
to
her
senses
they
said
you
just
had
to
leave
that
still
stubborn
kind
alone
on
the
morning
of
wesley
departure
theodosia
arose
at
sunrise
and
prepared
a
tempting
breakfast
irving
brooke
oldest
son
stanley
who
was
to
drive
wesley
to
the
station
came
over
early
with
his
express
wagon
wesley
trunk
corded
and
labelled
stood
on
the
back
platform
the
breakfast
was
a
very
silent
meal
when
it
was
over
wesley
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
went
to
the
door
around
which
theodosia
vines
were
beginning
to
twine
the
sun
was
not
yet
above
the
trees
and
the
long
shadows
lay
on
the
dewy
grass
the
wet
leaves
were
flickering
on
the
old
maples
that
grew
along
the
fence
between
the
yard
and
the
clover
field
beyond
the
skies
were
all
pearly
blue
cleanswept
of
clouds
from
the
little
farmhouse
the
green
meadows
sloped
down
to
the
valley
where
a
blue
haze
wound
in
and
out
like
a
glistening
ribbon
theodosia
went
out
and
stood
looking
inscrutably
on
while
wesley
and
irving
hoisted
the
trunk
into
the
wagon
and
tied
it
then
wesley
came
up
the
porch
steps
and
looked
at
her
dosia
he
said
a
little
huskily
i
said
i
would
ask
you
to
go
again
but
i
will
will
you
come
with
me
yet
no
said
theodosia
gently
he
held
out
his
hand
he
did
not
offer
to
kiss
her
goodbye
dosia
goodbye
wes
there
was
no
tremor
of
an
eyelash
with
her
wesley
smiled
bitterly
and
turned
away
when
the
wagon
reached
the
end
of
the
little
lane
he
turned
and
looked
back
for
the
last
time
through
all
the
years
that
followed
he
carried
with
him
the
picture
of
his
wife
as
he
saw
her
then
standing
amid
the
airy
shadows
and
wavering
golden
lights
of
the
morning
the
wind
blowing
the
skirt
of
her
pale
blue
wrapper
about
her
feet
and
ruffling
the
locks
of
her
bright
hair
into
a
delicate
golden
cloud
then
the
wagon
disappeared
around
a
curve
in
the
road
and
theodosia
turned
and
went
back
into
her
desolate
home
for
a
time
there
was
a
great
buzz
of
gossip
over
the
affair
people
wondered
over
it
old
jim
parmelee
understood
better
than
the
others
when
he
met
theodosia
he
looked
at
her
with
a
curious
twinkle
in
his
keen
old
eyes
looks
as
if
a
man
could
bend
her
any
way
he
a
mind
to
she
he
said
looks
is
deceiving
it
come
out
in
her
face
by
and
by
she
too
young
yet
but
it
there
it
does
seem
unnatteral
to
see
a
woman
so
stubborn
you
kinder
look
for
it
more
in
a
man
wesley
wrote
a
brief
letter
to
theodosia
when
he
reached
his
destination
he
said
he
was
well
and
was
looking
about
for
the
best
place
to
settle
he
liked
the
country
fine
he
was
at
a
place
called
red
butte
and
guessed
he
locate
there
two
weeks
later
he
wrote
again
he
had
taken
up
a
claim
of
three
hundred
acres
greene
and
cary
had
done
the
same
they
were
his
nearest
neighbours
and
were
three
miles
away
he
had
knocked
up
a
little
shack
was
learning
to
cook
his
own
meals
and
was
very
busy
he
thought
the
country
was
a
grand
one
and
the
prospects
good
theodosia
answered
his
letter
and
told
him
all
the
heatherton
news
she
signed
herself
theodosia
brooke
but
otherwise
there
was
nothing
in
the
letter
to
indicate
that
it
was
written
by
a
wife
to
her
husband
at
the
end
of
a
year
wesley
wrote
and
once
more
asked
her
to
go
out
to
him
he
was
getting
on
well
and
was
sure
she
would
like
the
place
it
was
a
little
rough
to
be
sure
but
time
would
improve
that
wo
you
let
bygones
be
bygones
dosia
he
wrote
and
come
out
to
me
do
my
dear
wife
theodosia
wrote
back
refusing
to
go
she
never
got
any
reply
nor
did
she
write
again
people
had
given
up
talking
about
the
matter
and
asking
theodosia
when
she
was
going
out
to
wes
heatherton
had
grown
used
to
the
chronic
scandal
within
its
decorous
borders
theodosia
never
spoke
of
her
husband
to
anyone
and
it
was
known
that
they
did
not
correspond
she
took
her
youngest
sister
to
live
with
her
she
had
her
garden
and
hens
and
a
cow
the
farm
brought
her
enough
to
live
on
and
she
was
always
busy
when
fifteen
years
had
gone
by
there
were
naturally
some
changes
in
heatherton
sleepy
and
unprogressive
as
it
was
most
of
the
old
people
were
in
the
little
hillside
that
fronted
the
sunrise
old
jim
parmelee
was
there
with
his
recollections
of
four
generations
men
and
women
who
had
been
in
their
prime
when
wesley
went
away
were
old
now
and
the
children
were
grown
up
and
married
theodosia
was
and
was
nothing
like
the
slim
dimpled
girl
who
had
stood
on
the
porch
steps
and
watched
her
husband
drive
away
that
morning
fifteen
years
ago
she
was
stout
and
comely
the
auburn
hair
was
darker
and
arched
away
from
her
face
in
smooth
shining
waves
instead
of
the
curls
her
face
was
unlined
and
but
no
woman
could
live
in
subjection
to
her
own
unbending
will
for
so
many
years
and
not
show
it
nobody
looking
at
theodosia
now
would
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
woman
with
such
a
determined
immoveable
face
could
stick
to
a
course
of
conduct
in
defiance
of
circumstances
wesley
brooke
was
almost
forgotten
people
knew
through
correspondents
of
greene
and
cary
that
he
had
prospered
and
grown
rich
the
curious
old
story
had
crystallized
into
accepted
history
a
life
may
go
on
without
ripple
or
disturbance
for
so
many
years
that
it
may
seem
to
have
settled
into
a
lasting
calm
then
a
sudden
wind
of
passion
may
sweep
over
it
and
leave
behind
a
wake
of
tempestuous
waters
such
a
time
came
at
last
to
theodosia
one
day
in
august
emory
merritt
dropped
in
emory
sister
was
ogden
greene
wife
and
the
merritts
kept
up
an
occasional
correspondence
with
her
hence
cecilia
merritt
always
knew
what
was
to
be
known
about
wesley
brooke
and
always
told
theodosia
because
she
had
never
been
expressly
forbidden
to
do
so
today
she
looked
slightly
excited
secretly
she
was
wondering
if
the
news
she
brought
would
have
any
effect
whatever
on
impassive
calm
do
you
know
dosia
wesley
real
sick
in
fact
phoebe
greene
says
they
have
very
poor
hopes
of
him
he
was
kind
of
ailing
all
the
spring
it
seems
and
about
a
month
ago
he
was
took
down
with
some
kind
of
slow
fever
they
have
out
there
phoebe
says
they
have
a
hired
nurse
from
the
nearest
town
and
a
good
doctor
but
she
reckons
he
wo
get
over
it
that
fever
goes
awful
hard
with
a
man
of
his
years
cecilia
merritt
who
was
the
fastest
talker
in
heatherton
had
got
this
out
before
she
was
brought
up
by
a
queer
sound
half
gasp
half
cry
from
theodosia
the
latter
looked
as
if
someone
had
struck
her
a
physical
blow
mercy
dosia
you
ai
going
to
faint
i
did
suppose
you
care
you
never
seemed
to
care
did
you
say
asked
theodosia
thickly
that
wesley
was
sick
dying
well
that
what
phoebe
said
she
may
be
mistaken
dosia
brooke
you
a
queer
woman
i
never
could
make
you
out
and
i
never
expect
to
i
guess
only
the
lord
who
made
you
can
translate
you
theodosia
stood
up
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
the
valley
beneath
them
ripening
to
harvest
was
like
a
river
of
gold
she
folded
up
her
sewing
with
a
steady
hand
it
five
so
i
ask
you
to
excuse
me
cecilia
i
have
a
good
deal
to
attend
to
you
can
ask
emory
if
he
drive
me
to
the
station
in
the
morning
i
going
out
to
wes
well
for
the
land
sake
said
cecilia
merritt
feebly
as
she
tied
on
her
gingham
sunbonnet
she
got
up
and
went
home
in
a
daze
theodosia
packed
her
trunk
and
worked
all
night
with
agony
and
fear
tearing
at
her
heart
the
iron
will
had
snapped
at
last
like
a
broken
reed
and
fierce
seized
on
her
i
been
a
wicked
woman
she
moaned
a
week
from
that
day
theodosia
climbed
down
from
the
dusty
stage
that
had
brought
her
from
the
station
over
the
prairies
to
the
unpretentious
little
house
where
wesley
brooke
lived
a
young
girl
so
like
what
ogden
greene
wife
had
been
fifteen
years
before
that
theodosia
involuntarily
exclaimed
phoebe
came
to
the
door
beyond
her
theodosia
saw
the
nurse
her
voice
trembled
does
does
wesley
brooke
live
here
she
asked
the
girl
nodded
yes
but
he
is
very
ill
at
present
nobody
is
allowed
to
see
him
theodosia
put
up
her
hand
and
loosened
her
bonnet
strings
as
if
they
were
choking
her
she
had
been
sick
with
the
fear
that
wesley
would
be
dead
before
she
got
to
him
the
relief
was
almost
overwhelming
but
i
must
see
him
she
cried
hysterically
she
the
calm
dosia
hysterical
i
am
his
wife
and
oh
if
he
had
died
before
i
got
here
the
nurse
came
forward
in
that
case
i
suppose
you
must
she
conceded
but
he
does
not
expect
you
i
must
prepare
him
for
the
surprise
she
turned
to
the
door
of
a
room
opening
off
the
kitchen
but
theodosia
who
had
hardly
heard
her
was
before
her
she
was
inside
the
room
before
the
nurse
could
prevent
her
then
she
stood
afraid
and
trembling
her
eyes
searching
the
dim
apartment
hungrily
when
they
fell
on
the
occupant
of
the
bed
theodosia
started
in
bitter
surprise
all
unconsciously
she
had
been
expecting
to
find
wesley
as
he
had
been
when
they
parted
could
this
gaunt
haggard
creature
with
the
unkempt
beard
and
prematurely
grey
hair
and
the
hollow
beseeching
eyes
be
the
ruddy
husband
of
her
youth
she
gave
a
choking
cry
of
pain
and
shame
and
the
sick
man
turned
his
head
their
eyes
met
amazement
incredulity
hope
dread
all
flashed
in
succession
over
wesley
brooke
lined
face
he
raised
himself
feebly
up
dosia
he
murmured
theodosia
staggered
across
the
room
and
fell
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
she
clasped
his
head
to
her
breast
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
oh
wes
wes
can

a
wicked
stubborn
woman
and
i
spoiled
our
lives

he
held
his
thin
trembling
arms
around
her
and
devoured
her
face
with
his
eyes
dosia
when
did
you
come
did
you
know
i
was
sick
wes
i
ca

till

much
to

more
considerate

i
forgive
you
dosia
she
entreated
i
forgive
you
dosia
he
said
gently
and
oh

so
good
to
see
you
once
more
darling
there
has
been
an
hour
since
i
left
you
that
i
have
longed
for
your
sweet
face
if
i
had
thought
you
really
cared
i
have
gone
back
but
i
thought
you
did
it
broke
my
heart
you
did
though
did
you
oh
yes
yes
yes
she
said
holding
him
more
closely
with
her
tears
falling
when
the
young
doctor
from
red
butte
came
that
evening
he
found
a
great
improvement
in
his
patient
joy
and
happiness
those
physicians
had
done
what
drugs
and
medicines
had
failed
to
do
i
going
to
get
better
doc
said
wesley
my
wife
has
come
and
she
going
to
stay
you
did
know
i
was
married
did
you
i
tell
you
the
story
some
day
i
proposed
going
back
east
but
dosia
says
she
rather
stay
here
i
the
happiest
man
in
red
butte
doc
he
squeezed
theodosia
hand
as
he
had
used
to
do
long
ago
in
heatherton
church
and
dosia
smiled
down
at
him
there
were
no
dimples
now
but
her
smile
was
very
sweet
the
ghostly
finger
of
old
henry
ford
pointing
down
through
the
generations
had
lost
its
power
to
brand
with
its
malediction
the
life
of
these
his
descendants
wesley
and
theodosia
had
joined
hands
with
their
happiness
the
story
of
an
invitation
bertha
sutherland
hurried
home
from
the
post
office
and
climbed
the
stairs
of
her
to
her
room
on
the
third
floor
her
roommate
grace
maxwell
was
sitting
on
the
divan
by
the
window
looking
out
into
the
twilight
a
year
ago
bertha
and
grace
had
come
to
dartmouth
to
attend
the
academy
and
found
themselves
roommates
bertha
was
bright
pretty
and
popular
the
favourite
of
her
classmates
and
teachers
grace
was
a
grave
quiet
girl
dressed
in
mourning
she
was
quite
alone
in
the
world
the
aunt
who
had
brought
her
up
having
recently
died
at
first
she
had
felt
shy
with
bright
and
brilliant
bertha
but
they
soon
became
friends
and
the
year
that
followed
was
a
very
pleasant
one
it
was
almost
ended
now
for
the
terminal
exams
had
begun
and
in
a
week
time
the
school
would
close
for
the
holidays
have
some
chocolates
grace
said
bertha
gaily
i
got
such
good
news
in
my
letter
tonight
that
i
felt
i
must
celebrate
it
fittingly
so
i
went
into
carter
and
invested
all
my
spare
cash
in
caramels
it
really
fortunate
the
term
is
almost
out
for
i
nearly
bankrupt
i
have
just
enough
left
to
furnish
a
for
commencement
night
and
no
more
what
is
your
good
news
may
i
ask
said
grace
you
know
i
have
an
aunt
margaret
commonly
called
aunt
meg
out
at
riversdale
do
you
there
never
was
such
a
dear
sweet
jolly
aunty
in
the
world
i
had
a
letter
from

louise
fyshe
and

i
feed

picnics
and
parties
and

there
said
bertha
looking
up
with
a
laugh
is
that
lovely
how
delightful
it
must
be
to
have
friends
like
that
to
love
you
and
plan
for
you
said
grace
wistfully
i
am
sure
you
will
have
a
pleasant
vacation
bertie
as
for
me
i
am
going
into
bookstore
until
school
reopens
i
saw
clarkman
today
and
he
agreed
to
take
me
bertha
looked
surprised
she
had
not
known
what
grace
vacation
plans
were
i
do
think
you
ought
to
do
that
grace
she
said
thoughtfully
you
are
not
strong
and
you
need
a
good
rest
it
will
be
awfully
trying
to
work
at
clarkman
all
summer
there
is
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
said
grace
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
you
know
i
as
poor
as
the
proverbial
church
mouse
bertie
and
the
simple
truth
is
that
i
ca
afford
to
pay
my
board
all
summer
and
get
my
winter
outfit
unless
i
do
something
to
earn
it
i
shall
be
too
busy
to
be
lonesome
and
i
shall
expect
long
newsy
letters
from
you
telling
me
all
your
fun
passing
your
vacation
on
to
me
at
you
see
well
i
must
set
to
work
at
those
algebra
problems
i
tried
them
before
dark
but
i
could
solve
them
my
head
ached
and
i
felt
so
stupid
how
glad
i
shall
be
when
exams
are
over
i
suppose
i
must
revise
that
senior
english
this
evening
said
bertha
absently
but
she
made
no
move
to
do
so
she
was
studying
her
friend
face
how
very
pale
and
thin
grace
looked
surely
much
paler
and
thinner
than
when
she
had
come
to
the
academy
and
she
had
not
by
any
means
been
plump
and
rosy
then
i
believe
she
could
not
stand
two
months
at
clarkman
thought
bertha
if
i
were
not
going
to
aunt
meg
i
would
ask
her
to
go
home
with
me
or
even
if
aunt
meg
had
room
for
another
guest
i
just
write
her
all
about
grace
and
ask
if
i
could
bring
her
with
me
aunt
meg
would
understand
she
always
understands
but
she
has
so
it
ca
be
just
then
a
thought
darted
into
bertha
brain
what
nonsense
she
said
aloud
so
suddenly
and
forcibly
that
grace
fairly
jumped
what
is
oh
nothing
much
said
bertha
getting
up
briskly
see
here
going
to
get
to
work
i
wasted
enough
time
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
divan
and
tried
to
study
her
senior
english
but
her
thoughts
wandered
hopelessly
and
finally
she
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
went
to
bed
there
she
could
not
sleep
she
lay
awake
and
wrestled
with
herself
it
was
after
midnight
when
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
said
solemnly
i
will
do
it
next
day
bertha
wrote
a
confidential
letter
to
aunt
meg
she
thanked
her
for
her
invitation
and
then
told
her
all
about
grace
and
what
i
want
to
ask
aunt
meg
is
that
you
will
let
me
transfer
my
invitation
to
grace
and
ask
her
to
go
to
riversdale
this
summer
in
my
place
do
think
me
ungrateful
no
i
sure
you
wo
you
always
understand
things
but
you
ca
have
us
both
and
i
rather
grace
should
go
it
will
do
her
so
much
good
and
i
have
a
lovely
home
of
my
own
to
go
to
and
she
has
none
aunt
meg
understood
as
usual
and
was
perfectly
willing
so
she
wrote
to
bertha
and
enclosed
a
note
of
invitation
for
grace
i
shall
have
to
manage
this
affair
very
carefully
reflected
bertha
grace
must
never
suspect
that
i
did
it
on
purpose
i
will
tell
her
that
circumstances
have
prevented
me
from
accepting
aunt
invitation
that
is
true
enough
no
need
to
say
that
the
circumstances
are
hers
not
mine
and
i
say
i
just
asked
aunt
meg
to
invite
her
in
my
place
and
that
she
has
done
so
when
grace
came
home
from
her
history
examination
that
day
bertha
told
her
story
and
gave
her
aunt
meg
cordial
note
you
must
come
to
me
in
bertha
place
wrote
the
latter
i
feel
as
if
i
knew
you
from
her
letters
and
i
will
consider
you
as
a
sort
of
honorary
niece
and
i
treat
you
as
if
you
were
bertha
herself
is
it
splendid
of
aunt
meg
said
bertha
diplomatically
of
course
you
go
gracie
oh
i
do
know
said
grace
in
bewilderment
are
you
sure
you
do
want
to
go
bertha
indeed
i
do
want
to
go
dreadfully
said
bertha
frankly
but
as
i
told
you
it
is
impossible
but
if
i
am
disappointed
aunt
meg
mus
be
you
must
go
grace
and
that
is
all
there
is
about
it
in
the
end
grace
did
go
a
little
puzzled
and
doubtful
still
but
thankful
beyond
words
to
escape
the
drudgery
of
the
counter
and
the
noise
and
heat
of
the
city
bertha
went
home
feeling
a
little
bit
blue
in
secret
it
can
not
be
denied
but
also
feeling
quite
sure
that
if
she
had
to
do
it
all
over
again
she
would
do
just
the
same
the
summer
slipped
quickly
by
and
finally
two
letters
came
to
bertha
one
from
aunt
meg
and
one
from
grace
i
had
a
lovely
time
wrote
the
latter
and
oh
bertie
what
do
you
think
i
am
to
stay
here
always
oh
of
course
i
am
going
back
to
school
next
month
but
this
is
to
be
my
home
after
this
aunt
meg
she
makes
me
call
her
that
says
i
must
stay
with
her
for
good
in
aunt
meg
letter
was
this
paragraph
is
writing
to
you
and
will
have
told
you
that
i
intend
to
keep
her
here
you
know
i
have
always
wanted
a
daughter
of
my
own
but
my
greedy
brothers
and
sisters
would
never
give
me
one
of
theirs
so
i
intend
to
adopt
grace
she
is
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
and
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
sending
her
here
you
will
not
know
her
when
you
see
her
she
has
grown
plump
and
bertha
folded
her
letters
up
with
a
smile
i
have
a
vague
delightful
feeling
that
i
am
the
good
angel
in
a
storybook
she
said
the
touch
of
fate
major
hill
was
in
her
element
this
did
not
often
happen
for
in
the
remote
prairie
town
of
the
canadian
northwest
where
her
husband
was
stationed
there
were
few
opportunities
for
and
hill
was
or
believed
herself
to
be
a
born
matchmaker
major
hill
was
in
command
of
the
detachment
of
northwest
mounted
police
at
dufferin
bluff
hill
was
wont
to
declare
that
it
was
the
most
forsaken
place
to
be
found
in
canada
or
out
of
it
but
she
did
her
very
best
to
brighten
it
up
and
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
the
officers
and
men
seconded
her
efforts
when
violet
thayer
came
west
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
old
schoolfellow
hill
cup
of
happiness
bubbled
over
in
her
secret
soul
she
vowed
that
violet
should
never
go
back
east
unless
it
were
to
prepare
a
wedding
trousseau
there
were
at
least
half
a
dozen
eligibles
among
the
and
hill
after
some
reflection
settled
on
ned
madison
as
the
flower
of
the
flock
he
and
violet
are
simply
made
for
each
other
she
told
major
hill
the
evening
before
miss
thayer
arrival
he
has
enough
money
and
he
is
handsome
and
fascinating
and
violet
is
a
beauty
and
a
clever
woman
into
the
bargain
they
ca
help
falling
in
love
i
sure
fate
perhaps
miss
thayer
may
be
booked
elsewhere
already
suggested
major
hill
he
had
seen
more
than
one
of
his
wife
card
castles
fall
into
heartbreaking
ruin
oh
no
violet
would
have
told
me
if
that
were
the
case
it
really
quite
time
for
her
to
think
of
settling
down
she
is
you
know
the
men
all
go
crazy
over
her
but
she
dreadfully
hard
to
please
however
she
ca
help
liking
ned
he
has
a
single
fault
i
firmly
believe
it
is
foreordained
and
in
this
belief
hill
rested
securely
but
nevertheless
did
not
fail
to
concoct
several
feminine
artifices
for
the
helping
on
of
foreordination
it
was
a
working
belief
with
her
that
it
was
always
well
to
have
the
gods
in
your
debt
violet
thayer
came
saw
and
conquered
within
hours
of
her
arrival
at
dufferin
bluff
she
had
every
one
of
the
eligibles
at
her
feet
not
to
mention
a
score
or
more
ineligibles
she
would
have
been
surprised
indeed
had
it
been
otherwise
miss
thayer
knew
her
power
and
was
somewhat
unduly
fond
of
exercising
it
but
she
was
a
very
nice
girl
into
the
bargain
and
so
thought
one
and
all
of
the
young
men
who
frequented
hill
and
counted
it
richly
worth
while
merely
to
look
at
miss
thayer
after
having
seen
nothing
for
weeks
except
flabby
girls
and
squaws
madison
was
foremost
in
the
field
of
course
madison
was
really
a
nice
fellow
and
quite
deserved
all
hill
encomiums
he
was
and
well
groomed
could
sing
and
dance
divinely
and
play
the
violin
to
perfection
the
other
were
all
jealous
of
him
and
more
so
than
ever
when
violet
thayer
came
they
did
not
consider
that
any
one
of
them
had
the
ghost
of
a
chance
if
madison
entered
the
lists
against
them
violet
liked
madison
and
was
very
chummy
with
him
after
her
own
fashion
she
thought
all
the
were
nice
boys
and
they
amused
her
for
which
she
was
grateful
she
had
expected
dufferin
bluff
to
be
very
dull
and
doubtless
it
would
pall
after
a
time
but
for
a
change
it
was
delightful
the
sixth
evening
after
her
arrival
found
hill
room
crowded
as
usual
with
violet
was
looking
her
best
in
a
distracting
new
gown
sergeant
fox
afterwards
described
it
to
a
brother
officer
as
a
stunning
sort
of
rig
between
a
cream
and
a
blue
and
a
brown
she
flirted
impartially
with
all
the
members
of
her
circle
at
first
but
gradually
narrowed
down
to
ned
madison
much
to
the
delight
of
hill
who
was
hovering
around
like
a
small
brilliant
butterfly
violet
was
talking
to
madison
and
watching
john
spencer
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
spencer
was
not
an
he
had
some
government
post
at
dufferin
bluff
and
this
was
his
first
call
at
lone
poplar
villa
since
miss
thayer
arrival
he
did
not
seem
to
be
dazzled
by
her
at
all
and
after
his
introduction
had
promptly
retired
to
a
corner
with
major
hill
where
they
talked
the
whole
evening
about
the
trouble
on
the
indian
reservation
at
loon
lake
possibly
this
indifference
piqued
miss
thayer
possibly
she
considered
it
refreshing
after
the
servile
adulation
of
the
at
any
rate
when
all
the
latter
were
gathered
about
the
piano
singing
a
chorus
with
gusto
she
shook
madison
off
and
went
over
to
the
corner
where
spencer
deserted
by
the
major
whose
bass
was
wanted
was
sitting
in
solitary
state
he
looked
up
indifferently
as
violet
shimmered
down
on
the
divan
beside
him
sergeant
robinson
who
was
watching
them
jealously
from
the
corner
beyond
the
palms
and
would
have
given
his
eyes
or
at
least
one
of
them
for
such
a
favour
mentally
vowed
that
spencer
was
the
dullest
fellow
he
had
ever
put
those
useful
members
on
do
you
sing
mr
spencer
asked
violet
by
way
of
beginning
a
conversation
as
she
turned
her
splendid
eyes
full
upon
him
robinson
would
have
lost
his
head
under
them
but
spencer
kept
his
heroically
no
was
his
calmly
brief
reply
given
without
any
bluntness
but
with
no
evident
intention
of
saying
anything
more
in
spite
of
her
social
experience
violet
felt
disconcerted
if
he
does
want
to
talk
to
me
i
wo
try
to
make
him
she
thought
crossly
no
man
had
ever
snubbed
her
so
before
spencer
listened
immovably
to
the
music
for
a
time
then
he
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
palpable
effort
to
be
civilly
sociable
how
do
you
like
the
west
miss
thayer
he
said
violet
smiled
the
smile
most
men
found
dangerous
very
much
so
far
as
i
have
seen
it
there
is
a
flavour
about
the
life
here
that
i
like
but
i
dare
say
it
would
soon
pall
it
must
be
horribly
lonesome
here
most
of
the
time
especially
in
winter
the
are
always
growling
that
it
is
returned
spencer
with
a
slight
smile
for
my
own
part
i
never
find
it
so
violet
decided
that
his
smile
was
very
becoming
to
him
and
that
she
liked
the
way
his
dark
hair
grew
over
his
forehead
i
do
think
i
seen
you
at
lone
poplar
villa
before
she
said
no
i
have
been
here
for
some
time
i
came
up
tonight
to
see
the
major
about
the
loon
lake
trouble
otherwise
you
would
have
come
thought
violet
flattering
very
aloud
she
said
is
it
serious
oh
no
a
mere
squabble
among
the
indians
have
you
ever
visited
the
reservation
miss
thayer
no
well
you
should
get
some
of
your
friends
to
take
you
out
it
would
be
worth
while
why
do
you
ask
me
to
go
yourself
said
violet
audaciously
spencer
smiled
again
have
i
failed
in
politeness
by
not
doing
so
i
fear
you
would
find
me
an
insufferably
dull
companion
so
he
was
not
going
to
ask
her
after
all
violet
felt
piqued
she
was
also
conscious
of
a
sensation
very
near
akin
to
disappointment
she
looked
across
at
madison
how
trim
and
dapper
he
was
i
hate
a
bandbox
man
she
said
to
herself
spencer
meanwhile
had
picked
up
one
of
hill
novels
from
the
stand
beside
him
of
he
said
glancing
at
the
cover
i
see
it
is
making
quite
a
sensation
down
east
i
suppose
you
read
it
yes
it
is
very
frivolous
and
clever
all
froth
but
delightful
froth
did
you
like
it
spencer
balanced
the
novel
reflectively
on
his
slender
brown
hand
well
yes
rather
but
i
do
care
for
novels
as
a
rule
i
understand
them
the
hero
of
this
book
now
do
you
believe
that
a
man
in
love
would
act
as
he
did
i
do
know
said
violet
amusedly
you
ought
to
be
a
better
judge
than
i
you
are
a
man
i
have
never
loved
anybody
so
i
am
in
no
position
to
decide
said
spencer
there
was
as
little
in
his
voice
as
if
he
were
telling
her
a
fact
concerning
the
loon
lake
trouble
violet
rose
to
the
occasion
you
have
an
interesting
experience
to
look
forward
to
she
said
spencer
turned
his
grey
eyes
squarely
upon
her
i
do
know
that
when
i
said
i
had
never
loved
i
meant
more
than
the
love
of
a
man
for
some
particular
woman
i
meant
love
in
every
sense
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
an
affection
for
any
human
being
my
parents
died
before
i
can
remember
my
only
living
relative
was
a
penurious
old
uncle
who
brought
me
up
for
shame
sake
and
kicked
me
out
on
the
world
as
soon
as
he
could
i
do
make
friends
easily
i
have
a
few
acquaintances
whom
i
like
but
there
is
not
a
soul
on
earth
for
whom
i
care
or
who
cares
for
me
what
a
revelation
love
will
be
to
you
when
it
comes
said
violet
softly
again
he
looked
into
her
eyes
do
you
think
it
will
come
he
asked
before
she
could
reply
hill
pounced
upon
them
violet
was
wanted
to
sing
spencer
would
excuse
her
would
he
spencer
did
so
obligingly
moreover
he
got
up
and
bade
his
hostess
good
night
violet
gave
him
her
hand
you
will
call
again
she
said
spencer
looked
across
at
madison
perhaps
it
was
accidental
i
think
not
he
said
if
as
you
say
love
will
come
some
time
it
would
be
a
very
unpleasant
revelation
if
it
came
in
hopeless
guise
and
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
miss
thayer
was
conscious
of
a
distinct
fluttering
of
her
heart
as
she
went
across
to
the
piano
this
was
a
new
sensation
for
her
and
worthy
of
being
analyzed
after
the
had
gone
she
asked
hill
who
spencer
was
oh
john
spencer
said
hill
carelessly
he
at
the
head
of
the
land
office
here
that
really
all
i
know
about
him
jack
says
he
is
a
downright
good
fellow
and
all
that
you
know
but
he
no
earthly
good
in
a
social
way
he
ca
talk
or
he
wo
he
flat
so
different
from
madison
is
he
very
said
violet
emphatically
after
hill
had
gone
out
violet
walked
to
the
nearest
mirror
and
looked
at
herself
with
her
forefinger
in
the
dimple
of
her
chin
it
is
very
odd
she
said
she
did
not
mean
the
dimple
spencer
had
told
her
he
was
not
coming
back
she
did
not
believe
this
but
she
did
not
expect
him
for
a
few
days
consequently
when
he
appeared
the
very
next
evening
she
was
surprised
madison
to
whom
she
was
talking
when
spencer
entered
does
not
know
to
this
day
what
she
had
started
to
say
to
him
for
she
never
finished
her
sentence
i
wonder
if
it
is
the
loon
lake
affair
again
she
thought
nervously
hill
came
up
at
this
point
and
whisked
madison
off
for
a
waltz
spencer
seeing
his
chance
came
straight
across
the
room
to
her
sergeant
robinson
who
was
watching
them
as
usual
is
willing
to
make
affidavit
that
miss
thayer
changed
colour
after
his
greeting
spencer
said
nothing
he
sat
beside
her
and
they
watched
hill
and
madison
dancing
violet
wondered
why
she
did
not
feel
bored
when
she
saw
madison
coming
back
to
her
she
was
conscious
of
an
unreasonable
anger
with
him
she
got
up
abruptly
let
us
go
out
on
the
verandah
she
said
imperiously
it
is
absolutely
stifling
in
here
they
went
out
it
was
very
cool
and
dusky
the
lights
of
the
town
twinkled
out
below
them
and
the
prairie
bluffs
behind
them
were
dark
and
sibilant
i
am
going
to
drive
over
to
loon
lake
tomorrow
afternoon
to
look
into
affairs
there
said
spencer
will
you
go
with
me
violet
reflected
a
moment
you
did
ask
me
as
if
you
really
wanted
me
to
go
she
said
spencer
put
his
hand
over
the
white
fingers
that
rested
on
the
railing
he
bent
forward
until
his
breath
stirred
the
tendrils
of
hair
on
her
forehead
yes
i
do
he
said
distinctly
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
to
loon
lake
tomorrow
more
than
i
ever
wanted
any
thing
in
my
life
before
later
on
when
everybody
had
gone
violet
had
her
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
with
hill
that
lady
felt
herself
aggrieved
i
think
you
treated
poor
ned
very
badly
tonight
vi
he
felt
really
blue
over
it
and
it
was
awfully
bad
form
to
go
out
with
spencer
as
you
did
and
stay
there
so
long
and
you
ought
to
flirt
with
him
he
does
understand
the
game
i
not
going
to
flirt
with
him
said
miss
thayer
calmly
oh
i
suppose
it
just
your
way
only
do
turn
the
poor
head
by
the
way
ned
is
coming
up
with
his
camera
tomorrow
afternoon
to
take
us
all
i
afraid
he
wo
find
me
at
home
said
violet
sweetly
i
am
going
out
to
loon
lake
with
mr
spencer
hill
flounced
off
to
bed
in
a
pet
she
was
disgusted
with
everything
she
declared
to
the
major
things
had
been
going
so
nicely
and
now
they
were
all
muddled
is
madison
coming
up
to
time
queried
the
major
sleepily
madison
it
violet
she
is
behaving
abominably
she
treated
poor
ned
shamefully
tonight
you
saw
yourself
how
she
acted
with
spencer
and
she
going
to
loon
lake
with
him
tomorrow
she
says
i
sure
i
do
know
what
she
can
see
in
him
he
the
dullest
pokiest
fellow
alive
so
different
from
her
in
every
way
perhaps
that
is
why
she
likes
him
suggested
the
major
the
attraction
of
opposites
and
all
that
you
know
but
hill
crossly
told
him
he
did
know
anything
about
it
so
being
a
wise
man
he
held
his
tongue
during
the
next
two
weeks
hill
was
the
most
dissatisfied
woman
in
the
four
districts
and
every
down
to
the
rawest
recruit
anathemized
spencer
in
secret
a
dozen
times
a
day
violet
simply
dropped
everyone
else
including
madison
in
the
coolest
most
unmistakable
way
one
night
spencer
did
not
come
to
lone
poplar
villa
violet
looked
for
him
to
the
last
when
she
realized
that
he
was
not
coming
she
went
to
the
verandah
to
have
it
out
with
herself
as
she
sat
huddled
up
in
a
dim
corner
beneath
a
silkily
rustling
western
maple
two
came
out
and
not
seeing
her
went
on
with
their
conversation
heard
about
spencer
questioned
one
no
what
of
him
well
they
say
miss
thayer
thrown
him
over
yesterday
i
was
passing
here
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
i
saw
spencer
coming
in
i
went
down
to
the
land
office
and
was
chatting
to
cribson
when
the
door
opened
about
half
an
hour
later
and
spencer
burst
in
he
was
pale
as
the
dead
and
looked
wild
fyshe
gone
to
rainy
river
about
those
crown
lands
yet
he
jerked
out
cribson
said
then
tell
him
he
need
i
going
myself
said
spencer
and
out
he
bolted
he
posted
off
to
rainy
river
today
and
wo
be
back
for
a
fortnight
she
be
gone
then
rather
rough
on
spencer
after
the
way
she
encouraged
him
returned
the
other
as
they
passed
out
of
earshot
violet
got
up
all
the
callers
were
gone
and
she
swept
in
to
hill
dramatically
edith
she
said
in
the
cold
steady
voice
that
to
those
who
knew
her
meant
breakers
ahead
for
somebody
spencer
was
here
yesterday
when
i
was
riding
with
the
major
was
he
not
what
did
you
tell
him
about
me
hill
looked
at
violet
blazing
eyes
and
wilted
i
did
tell
him
anything
much
what
was
it
hill
began
to
sob
do
look
at
me
like
that
violet
he
just
dropped
in
and
we
were
talking
about
you
at
least
i
was
and
i
had
heard
that
harry
maur
was
paying
you
marked
attention
before
you
came
west
and
and
that
some
people
thought
you
were
engaged
and
so
and
so
you
told
spencer
that
i
was
engaged
to
harry
st
maur
i
just
hinted
i
did
mean
harm
i
never
dreamed
you
really
i
thought
you
were
just
amusing
yourself
and
so
did
everybody
and
i
wanted
ned
madison
violet
had
turned
very
pale
i
love
him
she
said
hoarsely
and
you
sent
him
away
he
gone
to
rainy
river
i
shall
never
see
him
again
oh
yes
you
will
gasped
hill
faintly
he
come
back
when
he
knows
you
write
and
tell
him
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
write
and
ask
him
to
come
back
said
violet
wildly
i
enough
pride
left
yet
to
keep
me
from
doing
that
for
a
man
at
whose
head
i
thrown
myself
openly
yes
openly
and
who
has
never
in
words
at
least
told
me
he
cared
anything
about
me
i
will
never
forgive
you
edith
then
hill
found
herself
alone
with
her
lacerated
feelings
after
soothing
them
with
a
good
cry
she
set
to
work
thinking
seriously
there
was
no
doubt
she
had
muddled
things
badly
but
there
was
no
use
leaving
them
in
a
muddle
when
a
word
or
two
fitly
spoken
might
set
them
straight
hill
sat
down
and
wrote
a
very
diplomatic
letter
before
she
went
to
bed
and
the
next
morning
she
waylaid
sergeant
fox
and
asked
him
if
he
would
ride
down
to
rainy
river
with
a
very
important
message
for
spencer
sergeant
fox
wondered
what
it
could
be
but
it
was
not
his
to
reason
why
it
was
his
only
to
mount
and
ride
with
all
due
speed
for
hill
whims
and
wishes
were
as
stringent
and
binding
as
the
rules
of
the
force
that
evening
when
hill
and
violet
the
latter
very
silent
and
regal
were
sitting
on
the
verandah
a
horseman
came
galloping
up
the
rainy
river
trail
hill
excused
herself
and
went
in
five
minutes
later
john
spencer
covered
with
the
alkali
dust
of
his
twenty
ride
dismounted
at
violet
side
the
gave
a
concert
at
the
barracks
that
night
and
hill
and
her
major
went
to
it
as
well
as
everyone
else
of
any
importance
in
town
except
violet
and
spencer
they
sat
on
major
hill
verandah
and
watched
the
moon
rising
over
the
bluffs
and
making
reflections
in
the
prairie
lakes
it
seems
a
year
of
misery
since
last
night
sighed
violet
happily
you
could
have
been
quite
as
miserable
as
i
was
said
spencer
earnestly
you
were
everything
absolutely
everything
to
me
other
men
have
little
rills
and
driblets
of
affection
for
sisters
and
cousins
and
aunts
but
everything
in
me
went
out
to
you
do
you
remember
you
told
me
the
first
time
we
met
that
love
would
be
a
revelation
to
me
it
has
been
more
it
has
been
a
new
gospel
i
hardly
dared
hope
you
could
care
for
me
even
yet
i
do
know
why
you
do
i
love
you
said
violet
gravely
because
you
are
you
than
which
of
course
there
could
be
no
better
reason
the
waking
of
helen
robert
reeves
looked
somewhat
curiously
at
the
girl
who
was
waiting
on
him
at
his
solitary
breakfast
he
had
not
seen
her
before
arriving
at
his
summer
boarding
house
only
the
preceding
night
it
was
a
shabby
farmhouse
on
the
inland
shore
of
a
large
bay
that
was
noted
for
its
tides
and
had
wonderful
possibilities
of
light
and
shade
for
an
impressionist
reeves
was
an
enthusiastic
artist
it
mattered
little
to
him
that
the
boarding
accommodations
were
most
primitive
the
people
uncultured
and
dull
the
place
itself
utterly
isolated
as
long
as
he
could
revel
in
those
transcendent
sunsets
and
sunrises
those
marvellous
moonlights
those
wonderful
purple
shores
and
sweeps
of
shimmering
blue
water
the
owner
of
the
farm
was
angus
fraser
and
he
and
his
wife
seemed
to
be
a
reserved
uncouth
pair
with
no
apparent
interest
in
life
save
to
scratch
a
bare
living
out
of
their
few
stony
acres
he
had
an
impression
that
they
were
childless
and
was
at
a
loss
to
place
this
girl
who
poured
his
tea
and
brought
in
his
toast
she
did
not
resemble
either
fraser
or
his
wife
she
was
certainly
not
beautiful
being
very
tall
and
rather
awkward
and
dressed
in
a
particularly
unbecoming
dark
print
wrapper
her
luxuriant
hair
was
thick
and
black
and
was
coiled
in
a
heavy
knot
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
her
features
were
delicate
but
irregular
and
her
skin
was
very
brown
her
eyes
attracted
reeves
notice
especially
they
were
large
and
dark
and
full
of
a
wistful
longing
as
if
a
prisoned
soul
behind
them
were
vainly
trying
to
reveal
itself
reeves
could
find
out
nothing
of
her
from
herself
for
she
responded
to
his
tentative
questions
about
the
place
in
the
briefest
fashion
afterwards
he
interviewed
fraser
cautiously
and
ascertained
that
the
girl
name
was
helen
fraser
and
that
she
was
angus
niece
her
father
and
mother
are
dead
and
we
brought
her
up
helen
a
good
girl
in
most
ways
a
little
obstinate
and
sulky
now
and
then
but
generally
she
steady
enough
and
as
for
work
there
ai
a
girl
in
bay
beach
can
come
up
to
her
in
house
or
field
angus
calculates
she
saves
him
a
man
wages
clear
no
i
ai
got
nothing
to
say
against
helen
nevertheless
reeves
felt
somehow
that
fraser
did
not
like
her
husband
niece
he
often
heard
her
scolding
or
nagging
helen
at
her
work
and
noticed
that
the
latter
never
answered
back
but
once
after
angus
tongue
had
been
especially
bitter
he
met
the
girl
hurrying
along
the
hall
from
the
kitchen
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
reeves
felt
as
if
someone
had
struck
him
a
blow
he
went
to
angus
and
his
wife
that
afternoon
he
wished
to
paint
a
shore
picture
he
said
and
wanted
a
model
would
they
allow
miss
fraser
to
pose
for
him
he
would
pay
liberally
for
her
time
angus
and
his
wife
had
no
objection
they
would
pocket
the
money
and
helen
could
be
spared
a
spell
every
day
as
well
as
not
reeves
told
helen
of
his
plan
himself
meeting
her
in
the
evening
as
she
was
bringing
the
cows
home
from
the
low
shore
pastures
beyond
the
marsh
he
was
surprised
at
the
sudden
illumination
of
her
face
it
almost
transfigured
her
from
a
plain
girl
into
a
beautiful
woman
but
the
glow
passed
quickly
she
assented
to
his
plan
quietly
almost
lifelessly
he
walked
home
with
her
behind
the
cows
and
talked
of
the
sunset
and
the
mysterious
beauty
of
the
bay
and
the
purple
splendour
of
the
distant
coasts
she
listened
in
silence
only
once
when
he
spoke
of
the
distant
murmur
of
the
open
sea
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
what
does
it
say
to
you
she
asked
it
speaks
of
eternity
and
to
you
it
calls
me
she
answered
simply
and
then
i
want
to
go
out
and
meet
it
and
it
hurts
me
too
i
ca
tell
how
or
why
sometimes
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
were
asleep
and
wanted
to
wake
and
did
know
how
she
turned
and
looked
out
over
the
bay
a
dying
gleam
of
sunset
broke
through
a
cloud
and
fell
across
her
hair
for
a
moment
she
seemed
the
spirit
of
the
shore
personified
all
its
mystery
all
its
uncertainty
all
its
elusive
charm
she
has
possibilities
thought
reeves
next
day
he
began
his
picture
at
first
he
had
thought
of
painting
her
as
the
incarnation
of
a
sea
spirit
but
decided
that
her
moods
were
too
fitful
so
he
began
to
sketch
her
as
waiting
a
woman
looking
out
across
the
bay
with
a
world
of
hopeless
longing
in
her
eyes
the
subject
suited
her
well
and
the
picture
grew
apace
when
he
was
tired
of
work
he
made
her
walk
around
the
shore
with
him
or
row
up
the
head
of
the
bay
in
her
own
boat
he
tried
to
draw
her
out
at
first
with
indifferent
success
she
seemed
to
be
frightened
of
him
he
talked
to
her
of
many
things
the
far
outer
world
whose
echoes
never
reached
her
foreign
lands
where
he
had
travelled
famous
men
and
women
whom
he
had
met
music
art
and
books
when
he
spoke
of
books
he
touched
the
right
chord
one
of
those
transfiguring
flashes
he
delighted
to
evoke
now
passed
over
her
plain
face
that
is
what
i
always
wanted
she
said
hungrily
and
i
never
get
them
aunt
hates
to
see
me
reading
she
says
it
is
a
waste
of
time
and
i
love
it
so
i
read
every
scrap
of
paper
i
can
get
hold
of
but
i
hardly
ever
see
a
book
the
next
day
reeves
took
his
tennyson
to
the
shore
and
began
to
read
the
of
the
to
her
it
is
beautiful
was
her
sole
verbal
comment
but
her
rapt
eyes
said
everything
after
that
he
never
went
out
with
her
without
a
book
now
one
of
the
poets
now
some
prose
classic
he
was
surprised
by
her
quick
appreciation
of
and
sympathy
with
the
finest
passages
gradually
too
she
forgot
her
shyness
and
began
to
talk
she
knew
nothing
of
his
world
but
her
own
world
she
knew
and
knew
well
she
was
a
mine
of
traditional
history
about
the
bay
she
knew
the
rocky
coast
by
heart
and
every
old
legend
that
clung
to
it
they
drifted
into
making
excursions
along
the
shore
and
explored
its
wildest
retreats
the
girl
had
an
artist
eye
for
scenery
and
colour
effect
you
should
have
been
an
artist
reeves
told
her
one
day
when
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
exquisite
loveliness
of
a
shaft
of
light
falling
through
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
across
a
pool
at
their
base
i
would
rather
be
a
writer
she
said
slowly
if
i
could
only
write
something
like
those
books
you
have
read
to
me
what
a
glorious
destiny
it
must
be
to
have
something
to
say
that
the
whole
world
is
listening
for
and
to
be
able
to
say
it
in
words
that
will
live
forever
it
must
be
the
noblest
human
lot
yet
some
of
those
men
and
women
were
neither
good
nor
noble
said
reeves
gently
and
many
of
them
were
unhappy
helen
dismissed
the
subject
as
abruptly
as
she
always
did
when
the
conversation
touched
too
nearly
on
the
sensitive
edge
of
her
soul
dreams
do
you
know
where
i
am
taking
you
today
she
said
no
where
to
what
the
people
here
call
the
kelpy
cave
i
hate
to
go
there
i
believe
there
is
something
uncanny
about
it
but
i
think
you
will
like
to
see
it
it
is
a
dark
little
cave
in
the
curve
of
a
small
cove
and
on
each
side
the
headlands
of
rock
run
far
out
at
low
tide
we
can
walk
right
around
but
when
the
tide
comes
in
it
fills
the
cave
if
you
were
there
and
let
the
tide
come
past
the
points
you
would
be
drowned
unless
you
could
swim
for
the
rocks
are
so
steep
and
high
it
is
impossible
to
climb
them
reeves
was
interested
was
anyone
ever
caught
by
the
tide
yes
returned
helen
with
a
shudder
once
long
ago
before
i
was
born
a
girl
went
around
the
shore
to
the
cave
and
fell
asleep
there
and
the
tide
came
in
and
she
was
drowned
she
was
young
and
very
pretty
and
was
to
have
been
married
the
next
week
i
been
afraid
of
the
place
ever
since
the
treacherous
cave
proved
to
be
a
picturesque
and
spot
with
the
beach
of
glittering
sand
before
it
and
the
high
gloomy
walls
of
rock
on
either
hand
i
must
come
here
some
day
and
sketch
it
said
reeves
enthusiastically
and
you
must
be
the
kelpy
helen
and
sit
in
the
cave
with
your
hair
wrapped
about
you
and
seaweed
clinging
to
it
do
you
think
a
kelpy
would
look
like
that
said
the
girl
dreamily
i
do
i
think
it
is
a
wild
wicked
little
sea
imp
malicious
and
mocking
and
cruel
and
it
sits
here
and
watches
for
victims
well
never
mind
your
sea
kelpies
reeves
said
fishing
out
his
longfellow
they
are
a
tricky
folk
if
all
tales
be
true
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
rash
thing
to
talk
about
them
in
their
own
haunts
i
want
to
read
you
building
of
the
ship
you
will
like
it
i
sure
when
the
tide
turned
they
went
home
we
have
seen
the
kelpy
after
all
said
reeves
i
think
i
shall
see
him
some
day
said
helen
gravely
i
think
he
is
waiting
for
me
there
in
that
gloomy
cave
of
his
and
some
time
or
other
he
will
get
me
reeves
smiled
at
the
gloomy
fancy
and
helen
smiled
back
at
him
with
one
of
her
sudden
radiances
the
tide
was
creeping
swiftly
up
over
the
white
sands
the
sun
was
low
and
the
bay
was
swimming
in
a
pale
blue
glory
they
parted
at
clam
point
helen
to
go
for
the
cows
and
reeves
to
wander
on
up
the
shore
he
thought
of
helen
at
first
and
the
wonderful
change
that
had
come
over
her
of
late
then
he
began
to
think
of
another
face
a
marvellously
lovely
one
with
blue
eyes
as
tender
as
the
waters
before
him
then
helen
was
forgotten
the
summer
waned
swiftly
one
afternoon
reeves
took
a
fancy
to
revisit
the
kelpy
cave
helen
could
not
go
it
was
harvest
time
and
she
was
needed
in
the
field
do
let
the
kelpy
catch
you
she
said
to
him
half
seriously
the
tide
will
turn
early
this
afternoon
and
you
are
given
to
i
be
careful
he
promised
laughingly
and
he
meant
to
be
careful
but
somehow
when
he
reached
the
cave
its
unwholesome
charm
overcame
him
and
he
sat
down
on
the
boulder
at
its
mouth
an
hour
yet
before
tide
time
he
said
just
enough
time
to
read
that
article
on
impressionists
in
my
review
and
then
stroll
home
by
the
sandshore
from
reading
he
passed
to
and
drifted
into
sleep
with
his
head
pillowed
on
the
rocky
walls
of
the
cave
how
long
he
had
slept
he
did
not
know
but
he
woke
with
a
start
of
horror
he
sprang
to
his
feet
realizing
his
position
instantly
the
tide
was
in
far
in
past
the
headlands
already
above
and
beyond
him
towered
the
pitiless
unscalable
rocks
there
was
no
way
of
escape
reeves
was
no
coward
but
life
was
sweet
to
him
and
to
die
like
that
like
a
drowned
rat
in
a
hole
to
be
able
to
do
nothing
but
wait
for
that
swift
and
sure
oncoming
death
he
reeled
against
the
damp
rock
wall
and
for
a
moment
sea
and
sky
and
prisoning
headlands
and
tide
whirled
before
his
eyes
then
his
head
grew
clearer
he
tried
to
think
how
long
had
he
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
at
the
outside
well
death
was
sure
and
he
would
meet
it
bravely
but
to
wait
to
wait
helplessly
he
should
go
mad
with
the
horror
of
it
before
those
endless
minutes
would
have
passed
he
took
something
from
his
pocket
and
bent
his
head
over
it
pressing
his
lips
to
it
repeatedly
and
then
when
he
raised
his
face
again
a
dory
was
coming
around
the
headland
on
his
right
and
helen
fraser
was
in
it
reeves
was
dizzy
again
with
the
shock
of
joy
and
thankfulness
he
ran
down
over
the
little
stretch
of
sand
still
uncovered
by
the
tide
and
around
to
the
rocks
of
the
headlands
against
which
the
dory
was
already
grating
he
sprang
forward
impulsively
and
caught
the
cold
hands
in
his
as
she
dropped
the
oars
and
stood
up
helen
you
have
saved
me
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
i
he
broke
off
abruptly
for
she
was
looking
up
at
him
breathlessly
and
voicelessly
with
her
whole
soul
in
her
eyes
he
saw
in
them
a
revelation
that
amazed
him
he
dropped
her
hands
and
stepped
back
as
if
she
had
struck
him
in
the
face
helen
did
not
notice
the
change
in
him
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
her
voice
trembled
oh
i
was
afraid
i
should
be
too
late
when
i
came
in
from
the
field
aunt
hannah
said
you
had
not
come
back
and
i
knew
it
was
tide
time
and
i
felt
somehow
that
it
had
caught
you
in
the
cave
i
ran
down
over
the
marsh
and
took
joe
simmon
dory
if
i
had
not
got
here
in
time
she
broke
off
shiveringly
reeves
stepped
into
the
dory
and
took
up
the
oars
the
kelpy
would
have
been
sure
of
its
victim
then
he
said
trying
to
speak
lightly
it
would
have
almost
served
me
right
for
neglecting
your
warning
i
was
very
careless
you
must
let
me
row
back
i
am
afraid
you
have
overtasked
your
strength
trying
to
cheat
the
kelpy
reeves
rowed
homeward
in
an
absolute
silence
helen
did
not
speak
and
he
could
not
when
they
reached
the
dory
anchorage
he
helped
her
out
i
think
i
go
out
to
the
point
for
a
walk
he
said
i
want
to
steady
my
nerves
you
must
go
right
home
and
rest
do
be
anxious
i
wo
take
any
more
chances
with
sea
kelpies
helen
went
away
without
a
word
and
reeves
walked
slowly
out
to
the
point
he
was
grieved
beyond
measure
at
the
discovery
he
believed
he
had
made
he
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
he
was
not
a
vain
man
and
was
utterly
free
from
all
tendency
to
flirtation
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
waking
of
the
girl
deep
nature
might
be
attended
with
disastrous
consequences
he
had
honestly
meant
to
help
her
and
what
had
he
done
he
felt
very
uncomfortable
he
could
not
conscientiously
blame
himself
but
he
saw
that
he
had
acted
foolishly
and
of
course
he
must
go
away
at
once
and
he
must
also
tell
her
something
she
ought
to
know
he
wished
he
had
told
her
long
ago
the
following
afternoon
was
a
perfect
one
reeves
was
sketching
on
the
sandshore
when
helen
came
she
sat
down
on
a
camp
stool
a
little
to
one
side
and
did
not
speak
after
a
few
moments
reeves
pushed
away
his
paraphernalia
impatiently
i
do
feel
in
a
mood
for
work
he
said
it
is
too
dreamy
a
day
one
ought
to
do
nothing
to
be
in
keeping
besides
i
getting
lazy
now
that
my
vacation
is
nearly
over
i
must
go
in
a
few
days
he
avoided
looking
at
her
so
he
did
not
see
the
sudden
pallor
of
her
face
so
soon
she
said
in
a
voice
expressive
of
no
particular
feeling
yes
i
ought
not
to
have
lingered
so
long
my
world
will
be
forgetting
me
and
that
will
not
do
it
has
been
a
very
pleasant
summer
and
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
bay
beach
but
you
will
come
back
next
summer
asked
helen
quickly
you
said
you
would
reeves
nerved
himself
for
his
very
distasteful
task
perhaps
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
carelessness
but
if
i
do
so
i
shall
not
come
alone
somebody
who
is
very
dear
to
me
will
come
with
me
as
my
wife
i
have
never
told
you
about
her
helen
but
you
and
i
are
such
good
friends
that
i
do
not
mind
doing
so
now
i
am
engaged
to
a
very
sweet
girl
and
we
expect
to
be
married
next
spring
there
was
a
brief
silence
reeves
had
been
vaguely
afraid
of
a
scene
and
was
immensely
relieved
to
find
his
fear
unrealized
helen
sat
very
still
he
could
not
see
her
face
did
she
care
after
all
was
he
mistaken
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
perfectly
calm
thank
you
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
about
her
i
suppose
she
is
very
beautiful
yes
here
is
her
picture
you
can
judge
for
yourself
helen
took
the
portrait
from
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
steadily
it
was
a
miniature
painted
on
ivory
and
the
face
looking
out
from
it
was
certainly
lovely
it
is
no
wonder
you
love
her
said
the
girl
in
a
low
tone
as
she
handed
it
back
it
must
be
strange
to
be
so
beautiful
as
that
reeves
picked
up
his
tennyson
shall
i
read
you
something
what
will
you
have
read
please
i
want
to
hear
that
once
more
reeves
felt
a
sudden
dislike
to
her
choice
would
you
prefer
something
else
he
asked
hurriedly
turning
over
the
leaves
is
rather
sad
sha
i
read
instead
no
said
helen
in
the
same
lifeless
tone
i
have
no
sympathy
for
guinevere
she
suffered
and
her
love
was
unlawful
but
she
was
loved
in
return
she
did
not
waste
her
love
on
someone
who
did
not
want
or
care
for
it
elaine
did
and
her
life
went
with
it
read
me
the
story
reeves
obeyed
when
he
had
finished
he
held
the
book
out
to
her
helen
will
you
take
this
tennyson
from
me
in
remembrance
of
our
friendship
and
of
the
kelpy
cave
i
shall
never
forget
that
i
owe
my
life
to
you
thank
you
she
took
the
book
and
placed
a
little
thread
of
crimson
seaweed
that
had
been
caught
in
the
sand
between
the
pages
of
elaine
then
she
rose
i
must
go
back
now
aunt
will
need
me
thank
you
again
for
the
book
reeves
and
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
reeves
was
relieved
when
the
interview
was
over
her
calmness
had
reassured
him
she
did
not
care
very
much
after
all
it
was
only
a
passing
fancy
and
when
he
was
gone
she
would
soon
forget
him
he
went
away
a
few
days
later
and
helen
bade
him
an
impassive
when
the
afternoon
was
far
spent
she
stole
away
from
the
house
to
the
shore
with
her
tennyson
in
her
hand
and
took
her
way
to
the
kelpy
cave
the
tide
was
just
beginning
to
come
in
she
sat
down
on
the
big
boulder
where
reeves
had
fallen
asleep
beyond
stretched
the
gleaming
blue
waters
mellowing
into
a
hundred
fairy
shades
horizonward
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
were
around
her
in
front
was
the
white
line
of
the
incoming
tide
it
had
almost
reached
the
headlands
a
few
minutes
more
and
escape
would
be
cut
off
yet
she
did
not
move
when
the
dark
green
water
reached
her
and
the
lapping
wavelets
swished
up
over
the
hem
of
her
dress
she
lifted
her
head
and
a
sudden
strange
smile
flashed
over
her
face
perhaps
the
kelpy
understood
it
the
way
of
the
winning
of
anne
jerome
irving
had
been
courting
anne
stockard
for
fifteen
years
he
had
begun
when
she
was
twenty
and
he
was
and
now
that
jerome
was
forty
and
anne
in
a
village
where
everybody
knew
everybody
else
age
had
to
own
to
being
the
courtship
did
not
seem
any
nearer
a
climax
than
it
had
at
the
beginning
but
that
was
not
jerome
fault
poor
fellow
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
he
had
asked
anne
to
marry
him
and
anne
had
refused
jerome
was
disappointed
but
he
kept
his
head
and
went
on
courting
anne
just
the
same
that
is
he
went
over
to
esek
house
every
saturday
night
and
spent
the
evening
he
walked
home
with
anne
from
prayer
meeting
and
singing
school
and
parties
when
she
would
let
him
and
asked
her
to
go
to
all
the
concerts
and
socials
and
quilting
frolics
that
came
off
anne
never
would
go
of
course
but
jerome
faithfully
gave
her
the
chance
old
esek
rather
favoured
jerome
suit
for
anne
was
the
plainest
of
his
many
daughters
and
no
other
fellow
seemed
at
all
anxious
to
run
jerome
off
the
track
but
she
took
her
own
way
with
true
stockard
firmness
and
matters
were
allowed
to
drift
on
at
the
will
of
time
or
chance
three
years
later
jerome
tried
his
luck
again
with
precisely
the
same
result
and
after
that
he
had
asked
anne
regularly
once
a
year
to
marry
him
and
just
as
regularly
anne
said
no
a
little
more
brusquely
and
a
little
more
decidedly
every
year
now
in
the
mellowness
of
a
courtship
jerome
did
not
mind
it
at
all
he
knew
that
everything
comes
to
the
man
who
has
patience
to
wait
time
of
course
had
not
stood
still
with
anne
and
jerome
or
with
the
history
of
deep
meadows
at
the
stockard
homestead
the
changes
had
been
many
and
marked
every
year
or
two
there
had
been
a
wedding
in
the
big
brick
farmhouse
and
one
of
old
esek
girls
had
been
the
bride
each
time
julia
and
grace
and
celia
and
betty
and
theodosia
and
clementina
stockard
were
all
married
and
gone
but
anne
had
never
had
another
lover
there
had
to
be
an
old
maid
in
every
big
family
she
said
and
she
was
not
going
to
marry
jerome
irving
just
for
the
sake
of
having
on
her
tombstone
old
esek
and
his
wife
had
been
put
away
in
the
deep
meadows
the
broad
fertile
stockard
acres
passed
into
possession
she
was
a
good
and
the
farm
continued
to
be
the
best
in
the
district
she
kept
two
hired
men
and
a
servant
girl
and
the
of
her
oldest
sister
lived
with
her
there
were
few
visitors
at
the
stockard
place
now
but
jerome
dropped
in
every
saturday
night
with
clockwork
regularity
and
talked
to
anne
about
her
stock
and
advised
her
regarding
the
rotation
of
her
crops
and
the
setting
out
of
her
orchards
and
at
ten
he
would
take
his
hat
and
cane
and
tell
anne
to
be
good
to
herself
and
go
home
anne
had
long
since
given
up
trying
to
discourage
him
she
even
accepted
attentions
from
him
now
that
she
had
used
to
refuse
he
always
walked
home
with
her
from
evening
meetings
and
was
her
partner
in
the
games
at
quilting
parties
it
was
great
fun
for
the
young
folks
old
jerome
and
anne
were
a
standing
joke
in
deep
meadows
but
the
older
people
had
ceased
to
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
anne
laughed
at
jerome
as
she
had
always
done
and
would
not
have
owned
for
the
world
that
she
could
have
missed
him
jerome
was
useful
she
admitted
and
a
comfortable
friend
and
she
would
have
liked
him
well
enough
if
he
would
only
omit
that
ridiculous
yearly
ceremony
of
proposal
it
was
jerome
fortieth
birthday
when
anne
refused
him
again
he
realized
this
as
he
went
down
the
road
in
the
moonlight
and
doubt
and
dismay
began
to
creep
into
his
heart
anne
and
he
were
both
getting
old
there
was
no
disputing
that
fact
it
was
high
time
that
he
brought
her
to
terms
if
he
was
ever
going
to
jerome
was
an
mortal
and
always
took
things
placidly
but
he
did
not
mean
to
have
all
those
fifteen
years
of
patient
courting
go
for
nothing
he
had
thought
anne
would
get
tired
of
saying
no
sooner
or
later
and
say
yes
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
have
a
change
but
getting
tired
did
not
seem
to
run
in
the
stockard
blood
she
had
said
no
that
night
just
as
coolly
and
decidedly
and
unsentimentally
as
she
said
it
fifteen
years
before
jerome
had
the
sensation
of
going
around
in
a
circle
and
never
getting
any
further
on
he
made
up
his
mind
that
something
must
be
done
and
just
as
he
got
to
the
brook
that
divides
deep
meadows
west
from
deep
meadows
central
an
idea
struck
him
it
was
a
good
idea
and
amused
him
he
laughed
aloud
and
slapped
his
thigh
much
to
the
amusement
of
two
boys
who
were
sitting
unnoticed
on
the
railing
of
the
bridge
there
old
jerome
going
home
from
seeing
anne
stockard
said
one
wonder
what
on
earth
he
laughing
at
seems
to
me
if
i
could
get
a
wife
without
hoeing
a
row
i
give
up
trying
but
then
the
speaker
was
a
hamilton
and
the
hamiltons
never
had
any
perseverance
jerome
although
a
man
owning
a
good
farm
had
so
to
speak
no
home
of
his
own
the
old
irving
homestead
belonged
to
his
older
brother
who
had
a
wife
and
family
jerome
lived
with
them
and
was
so
used
to
it
he
did
mind
at
forty
a
lover
must
not
waste
time
jerome
thought
out
the
details
that
night
and
next
day
he
opened
the
campaign
but
it
was
not
until
the
evening
after
that
that
anne
stockard
heard
the
news
it
was
her
niece
octavia
who
told
her
the
latter
had
been
having
a
chat
up
the
lane
with
sam
mitchell
and
came
in
with
a
broad
smile
on
her
round
rosy
face
and
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
i
guess
you
lost
your
beau
this
time
aunt
anne
it
looks
as
if
he
meant
to
take
you
at
your
word
at
last
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
asked
anne
a
little
sharply
she
was
in
the
pantry
counting
eggs
and
octavia
interruption
made
her
lose
her
count
now
i
ca
remember
whether
it
was
six
or
seven
dozen
i
said
last
i
shall
have
to
count
them
all
over
again
i
wish
octavia
that
you
could
think
of
something
besides
beaus
all
the
time
well
but
listen
persisted
octavia
wickedly
jerome
irving
was
at
the
social
at
the
cherry
valley
parsonage
last
night
and
he
had
harriet
warren
there
took
her
there
and
drove
her
home
again
i
do
believe
it
cried
anne
before
she
thought
she
dropped
an
egg
into
the
basket
so
abruptly
that
the
shell
broke
oh
it
true
enough
sam
mitchell
told
me
he
was
there
and
saw
him
sam
says
he
looked
quite
beaming
and
was
dressed
to
kill
and
followed
harriet
around
like
her
shadow
i
guess
you
wo
have
any
more
bother
with
him
aunt
anne
in
the
process
of
picking
the
broken
egg
out
of
the
whole
ones
anne
had
recovered
her
equanimity
she
gave
a
careful
little
laugh
well
it
to
be
hoped
so
goodness
knows
it
time
he
tried
somebody
else
go
and
change
your
dress
for
milking
octavia
and
do
spend
quite
so
much
time
gossiping
up
the
lane
with
sam
mitchell
he
always
was
a
young
girls
ought
to
be
so
pert
when
the
subdued
octavia
had
gone
anne
tossed
the
broken
eggshell
out
of
the
pantry
window
viciously
enough
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
jerome
irving
always
was
an
idiot
the
idea
of
his
going
after
harriet
warren
he
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
a
warren
too
i
seen
the
time
an
irving
would
be
seen
on
the
same
side
of
the
road
with
a
warren
well
anyhow
i
care
and
he
need
suppose
i
will
it
will
be
a
relief
not
to
have
him
hanging
around
any
longer
it
might
have
been
a
relief
but
anne
felt
strangely
lonely
as
she
walked
home
alone
from
prayer
meeting
the
next
night
jerome
had
not
been
there
the
warrens
were
methodists
and
anne
rightly
guessed
that
he
had
gone
to
the
methodist
prayer
meeting
at
cherry
valley
dancing
attendance
on
harriet
she
said
to
herself
scornfully
when
she
got
home
she
looked
at
her
face
in
the
glass
more
critically
than
she
had
done
for
years
anne
stockard
at
her
best
had
never
been
pretty
when
young
she
had
been
called
gawky
she
was
very
tall
and
her
figure
was
lank
and
angular
she
had
a
long
pale
face
and
dusky
hair
her
eyes
had
been
good
a
glimmering
hazel
large
and
they
were
pretty
yet
but
the
crow
feet
about
them
were
plainly
visible
there
were
brackets
around
her
mouth
too
and
her
cheeks
were
hollow
anne
suddenly
realized
as
she
had
never
realized
before
that
she
had
grown
old
that
her
youth
was
left
far
behind
she
was
an
old
maid
and
harriet
warren
was
young
and
pretty
long
thin
lips
suddenly
quivered
i
declare
i
a
worse
fool
than
jerome
she
said
angrily
when
saturday
night
came
jerome
did
not
the
corner
of
the
big
porch
where
he
usually
sat
looked
bare
and
lonely
anne
was
short
with
octavia
and
boxed
the
cat
ears
and
raged
at
herself
what
did
she
care
if
jerome
irving
never
came
again
she
could
have
married
him
years
ago
if
she
had
wanted
to
everybody
knew
that
at
sunset
she
saw
a
buggy
drive
past
her
gate
even
at
that
distance
she
recognized
harriet
warren
handsome
profile
it
was
jerome
new
buggy
and
jerome
was
driving
the
wheel
spokes
flashed
in
the
sunlight
as
they
crept
up
the
hill
perhaps
they
dazzled
anne
eyes
a
little
at
least
for
that
or
some
other
reason
she
dabbed
her
hand
viciously
over
them
as
she
turned
sharply
about
and
went
upstairs
octavia
was
practising
her
music
lesson
in
the
parlour
below
and
singing
in
a
sweet
shrill
voice
the
hired
men
were
laughing
and
talking
in
the
yard
anne
slammed
down
her
window
and
banged
her
door
and
then
lay
down
on
her
bed
she
said
her
head
ached
the
deep
meadows
people
were
amused
and
made
joking
remarks
to
anne
which
she
had
to
take
amiably
because
she
had
no
excuse
for
resenting
them
in
reality
they
stung
her
pride
unendurably
when
jerome
had
gone
she
realized
that
she
had
no
other
intimate
friend
and
that
she
was
a
very
lonely
woman
whom
nobody
cared
about
one
night
it
was
three
weeks
afterward
she
met
jerome
and
harriet
squarely
she
was
walking
to
church
with
octavia
and
they
were
driving
in
the
opposite
direction
jerome
had
his
new
buggy
and
crimson
lap
robe
his
coat
shone
like
satin
and
had
rosettes
of
crimson
on
his
bridle
jerome
was
dressed
extremely
well
and
looked
quite
young
with
his
round
ruddy
face
and
clear
blue
eyes
harriet
was
sitting
primly
and
consciously
by
his
side
she
was
a
very
handsome
girl
with
bold
eyes
and
was
somewhat
overdressed
she
wore
a
big
flowery
hat
and
a
white
lace
veil
and
looked
at
anne
with
a
supercilious
smile
anne
felt
dowdy
and
old
she
was
very
pale
jerome
lifted
his
hat
and
bowed
pleasantly
as
they
drove
past
suddenly
harriet
laughed
out
anne
did
not
look
back
but
her
face
crimsoned
darkly
was
that
girl
laughing
at
her
she
trembled
with
anger
and
a
sharp
hurt
feeling
when
she
got
home
that
night
she
sat
a
long
while
by
her
window
jerome
was
gone
and
he
let
harriet
warren
laugh
at
her
and
he
would
never
come
back
to
her
well
it
did
not
matter
but
she
had
been
a
fool
only
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
jerome
could
act
so
if
i
thought
he
would
i
might
have
been
so
sharp
with
him
was
as
far
as
she
would
let
herself
go
even
in
thought
when
four
weeks
had
elapsed
jerome
came
over
one
saturday
night
he
was
fluttered
and
anxious
but
hid
it
in
a
masterly
manner
anne
was
taken
by
surprise
she
had
not
thought
he
would
ever
come
again
and
was
off
her
guard
he
had
come
around
the
porch
corner
abruptly
as
she
stood
there
in
the
dusk
and
she
started
very
perceptibly
good
evening
anne
he
said
easily
and
unblushingly
anne
choked
up
she
was
very
angry
or
thought
she
was
jerome
appeared
not
to
notice
her
lack
of
welcome
he
sat
coolly
down
in
his
old
place
his
heart
was
beating
like
a
hammer
but
anne
did
not
know
that
i
suppose
she
said
cuttingly
that
you
on
your
way
down
to
the
bridge
it
almost
a
pity
for
you
to
waste
time
stopping
here
at
all
any
more
than
you
have
of
late
no
doubt
harriet
be
expecting
you
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
flashed
over
jerome
face
he
looked
shrewdly
at
anne
who
was
not
looking
at
him
but
was
staring
uncompromisingly
out
over
the
poppy
beds
a
jealous
woman
always
gives
herself
away
if
anne
had
been
indifferent
she
would
not
have
given
him
that
slap
in
the
face
i
dunno
she
will
he
replied
coolly
i
did
say
for
sure
whether
i
be
down
tonight
or
not
it
so
long
since
i
had
a
chat
with
you
i
thought
i
drop
in
for
a
spell
but
of
course
if
i
not
wanted
i
can
go
where
i
will
be
anne
could
not
get
back
her
her
nerves
were
all
strung
up
as
she
would
have
said
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
was
right
on
the
brink
of
a
scene
but
she
could
not
help
herself
i
guess
it
does
matter
much
what
i
want
she
said
stonily
at
any
rate
it
has
seemed
that
way
lately
you
do
care
of
course
oh
no
harriet
warren
is
all
you
care
about
well
i
wish
you
joy
of
her
jerome
looked
puzzled
or
pretended
to
in
reality
he
was
hugging
himself
with
delight
i
do
just
understand
you
anne
he
said
hesitatingly
you
appear
to
be
vexed
about
something
i
oh
no
i
not
irving
of
course
old
friends
do
count
now
well
i
no
doubt
new
ones
will
wear
just
as
well
if
it
about
my
going
to
see
harriet
said
jerome
easily
i
see
as
how
it
can
matter
much
to
you
goodness
knows
you
took
enough
pains
to
show
me
you
did
want
me
i
do
blame
you
a
woman
has
a
right
to
please
herself
and
a
man
ought
to
have
sense
to
take
his
answer
and
go
i
had
and
that
where
i
made
my
mistake
i
mean
to
pester
you
any
more
but
we
can
be
real
good
friends
we
i
sure
i
as
much
your
friend
as
ever
i
was
now
i
hold
that
this
speech
of
jerome
delivered
in
a
cool
tone
as
of
a
man
stating
a
case
with
dispassionate
fairness
was
a
masterpiece
it
was
the
last
cleverly
executed
movement
of
the
campaign
if
it
failed
to
effect
a
capitulation
he
was
a
defeated
man
but
it
did
not
fail
anne
had
got
to
that
point
where
an
excited
woman
must
go
mad
or
cry
anne
cried
she
sat
flatly
down
on
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
jerome
hat
went
one
way
and
his
cane
another
jerome
himself
sprang
across
the
intervening
space
and
dropped
into
the
chair
beside
anne
he
caught
her
hand
in
his
and
threw
his
arm
boldly
around
her
waist
goodness
gracious
anne
do
you
care
after
all
tell
me
that
i
do
suppose
it
matters
to
you
if
i
do
sobbed
anne
it
seemed
to
matter
anyhow
anne
look
here
did
i
come
after
you
for
fifteen
years
it
you
i
always
have
wanted
and
want
yet
if
i
can
get
you
i
do
care
a
rap
for
harriet
warren
or
anyone
but
you
now
that
the
truth
right
out
anne
no
doubt
it
was
and
anne
was
convinced
of
it
but
she
had
to
have
her
cry
out
on
jerome
shoulder
and
it
soothed
her
nerves
wonderfully
later
on
octavia
slipping
noiselessly
up
the
steps
in
the
dusk
saw
a
sight
that
transfixed
her
with
astonishment
when
she
recovered
herself
she
turned
and
fled
wildly
around
the
house
running
bump
into
sam
mitchell
who
was
coming
across
the
yard
from
a
twilight
conference
with
the
hired
men
goodness
tavy
what
the
matter
y
look
y
seen
a
ghost
octavia
leaned
up
against
the
wall
in
spasms
of
mirth
oh
sam
she
gasped
old
jerome
irving
and
aunt
anne
are
sitting
round
there
in
the
dark
on
the
front
porch
and
he
had
his
arms
around
her
kissing
her
and
they
never
saw
nor
heard
me
no
if
they
were
deaf
and
blind
sam
gave
a
tremendous
whistle
and
then
went
off
into
a
shout
of
laughter
whose
echoes
reached
even
to
the
gloom
of
the
front
porch
and
the
ears
of
the
lovers
but
they
did
not
know
he
was
laughing
at
them
and
would
not
have
cared
if
they
had
they
were
too
happy
for
that
there
was
a
wedding
that
fall
and
anne
stockard
was
the
bride
when
she
was
safely
his
jerome
confessed
all
and
was
graciously
forgiven
but
it
was
kind
of
mean
to
harriet
said
anne
rebukingly
to
go
with
her
and
get
her
talked
about
and
then
drop
her
as
you
did
you
think
so
yourself
jerome
her
husband
eyes
twinkled
well
hardly
that
you
see
harriet
engaged
to
that
johnson
fellow
out
west
generally
known
but
i
knew
it
and
that
why
i
picked
on
her
i
thought
it
probable
that
she
be
willing
enough
to
flirt
with
me
for
a
little
diversion
even
if
i
was
old
that
sort
of
a
girl
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
that
did
fetch
it
nothing
would
and
i
give
up
for
good
and
all
but
it
did
it
anne
i
should
say
so
it
was
horrid
of
you
jerome
but
i
daresay
just
as
well
you
did
or
i
likely
never
have
found
out
that
i
could
get
along
without
you
i
did
feel
dreadful
poor
octavia
could
tell
you
i
was
as
cross
as
x
how
did
you
come
to
think
of
it
jerome
a
fellow
had
to
do
something
said
jerome
oracularly
and
i
have
done
most
anything
to
get
you
anne
that
a
fact
and
there
it
was
courting
fifteen
years
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
i
dunno
though
how
i
did
come
to
think
of
it
guess
it
was
a
sort
of
inspiration
anyhow
i
got
you
and
that
what
i
set
out
to
do
in
the
beginning
young
si
bentley
had
just
driven
into
the
yard
with
the
new
summer
boarder
bentley
and
agnes
were
peeping
at
her
from
behind
the
parlour
curtains
with
the
keen
interest
that
they
shut
in
by
their
restricted
farm
life
always
felt
in
any
visitor
from
the
outside
world
lying
beyond
their
boundary
of
purple
misted
hills
bentley
was
a
plump
woman
with
a
motherly
smile
agnes
was
a
fair
slim
schoolgirl
as
tall
as
her
mother
with
a
sweet
face
and
a
promise
of
peach
blossom
prettiness
in
the
years
to
come
the
arrival
of
a
summer
boarder
was
a
great
event
in
her
quiet
life
ai
she
pretty
whispered
bentley
admiringly
as
the
girl
came
slowly
up
the
green
slope
before
the
house
i
do
hope
nice
you
can
generally
calculate
on
men
boarders
but
girls
are
doubtful
preserve
me
from
a
cranky
boarder
i
had
enough
of
them
i
kinder
like
her
looks
though
ethel
lennox
had
paused
at
the
front
door
as
bentley
and
agnes
came
into
the
hall
agnes
gazed
at
the
stranger
with
shy
unenvious
admiration
the
latter
stood
on
the
stone
step
just
where
the
big
chestnut
by
the
door
cast
flickering
gleams
and
shadows
over
her
dress
and
shining
hair
she
was
tall
and
gowned
in
some
simple
white
material
that
fell
about
her
in
graceful
folds
she
wore
a
cluster
of
pale
pink
roses
at
her
belt
and
a
big
picturesque
white
hat
shaded
her
face
and
the
glossy
clinging
masses
of
her
red
hair
hair
that
was
neither
auburn
nor
chestnut
but
simply
red
nor
would
anyone
have
wished
it
otherwise
having
once
seen
that
glorious
mass
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
of
rippling
luxuriance
her
complexion
was
of
that
perfect
waxen
whiteness
that
goes
with
burnished
red
hair
and
the
darkest
of
dilated
violet
eyes
her
delicately
chiselled
features
wore
what
might
have
been
a
somewhat
too
decided
impress
of
spirit
and
independence
had
it
not
been
for
the
sweet
mouth
red
and
dimpled
and
curving
that
parted
in
a
slow
charming
smile
as
bentley
came
forward
with
her
kindly
welcome
you
must
be
real
tired
miss
lennox
it
a
long
drive
from
the
train
down
here
agnes
show
miss
lennox
up
to
her
room
and
tea
will
be
ready
when
you
come
down
agnes
came
forward
with
the
shy
grace
that
always
won
friends
for
her
and
the
two
girls
went
slowly
up
the
broad
staircase
while
bentley
bustled
away
to
bring
in
the
tea
and
put
a
goblet
of
damask
roses
on
the
table
she
looks
like
a
picture
does
she
john
she
said
to
her
husband
i
never
saw
such
a
face
and
that
hair
too
would
you
have
believed
red
hair
could
be
so
handsome
she
seems
real
friendly
none
of
your
fine
ladies
i
had
all
i
want
of
them
i
can
tell
you
sh
sh
sh
said
bentley
warningly
as
ethel
lennox
came
in
with
her
arm
about
agnes
she
looked
even
more
lovely
without
her
hat
with
the
soft
red
tendrils
of
hair
lying
on
her
forehead
bentley
sent
a
telegraphic
message
of
admiration
across
the
table
to
her
husband
who
was
helping
the
cold
tongue
and
feeling
his
way
to
a
conversation
you
find
it
pretty
quiet
here
miss
lennox
we
plain
folks
and
there
ai
much
going
and
coming
maybe
you
do
mind
that
though
i
like
it
when
one
has
been
teaching
school
all
the
year
in
a
noisy
city
quiet
seems
the
one
thing
to
be
desired
besides
i
like
to
fancy
myself
something
of
an
artist
i
paint
and
sketch
a
little
when
i
have
time
and
miss
courtland
who
was
here
last
summer
said
i
could
not
find
a
more
suitable
spot
so
i
came
because
i
knew
that
mackerel
fishing
was
carried
on
along
the
shore
and
i
would
have
a
chance
to
study
character
among
the
fishermen
well
the
shore
ai
far
away
and
it
pretty
though
maybe
us
folks
here
do
appreciate
it
rightly
being
as
we
so
used
to
it
strangers
are
always
going
crazy
over
its
as
they
call
it
as
for
i
reckon
you
find
all
you
want
of
that
among
the
pointers
anyway
i
never
seed
such
critters
as
they
be
when
you
get
tired
of
painting
maybe
you
can
amuse
yourself
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
our
mystery
oh
have
you
a
mystery
how
interesting
yes
a
mystery
a
mystery
repeated
bentley
solemnly
that
nobody
hai
been
able
to
solve
so
far
i
give
it
up
so
has
everyone
else
maybe
you
have
better
luck
but
what
is
it
the
mystery
said
bentley
dramatically
is
young
si
he
the
mystery
last
spring
just
when
the
herring
struck
in
a
young
chap
suddenly
appeared
at
the
point
he
appeared
from
what
corner
of
the
globe
nobody
hai
ever
been
able
to
make
out
he
bought
a
boat
and
a
shanty
down
at
my
shore
and
went
into
a
sort
of
mackerel
partnership
with
snuffy
curtis
snuffy
supplying
the
experience
and
this
young
fellow
the
cash
i
reckon
snuffy
as
poor
as
job
turkey
it
was
a
windfall
for
him
and
there
he
fished
all
summer
but
his
name
young
si
well
of
course
that
is
it
he
did
give
himself
out
as
brown
but
nobody
believes
that
his
handle
sounds
unnatteral
here
he
bought
his
establishment
from
si
who
used
to
fish
down
there
and
was
a
mysterious
old
critter
in
a
way
too
so
when
this
young
fellow
stepped
in
from
goodness
knows
where
some
of
the
pointers
christened
him
young
si
for
a
joke
and
he
never
gets
anything
else
does
seem
to
mind
it
he
a
moody
sort
of
chap
yet
he
unpopular
along
shore
i
believe
snuffy
was
telling
me
they
like
him
real
well
considering
his
unsociableness
anyways
he
as
handsome
a
chap
as
i
ever
seed
and
well
eddicated
too
he
ai
none
of
your
ordinary
fishermen
some
of
us
kind
of
think
he
a
runaway
got
into
some
scrape
or
another
maybe
and
is
skulking
around
here
to
keep
out
of
jail
but
wife
here
wo
give
in
to
that
no
i
never
will
said
bentley
firmly
young
si
comes
here
often
for
milk
and
butter
and
he
a
perfect
gentleman
ever
convince
me
that
he
has
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
whatever
his
reason
for
wasting
his
life
down
there
at
that
shore
he
ai
wasting
his
life
chuckled
bentley
he
making
money
young
si
is
though
he
do
seem
to
care
about
that
a
mite
this
has
been
a
big
year
for
mackerel
and
he
smart
if
he
know
much
when
he
begun
he
ahead
of
snuffy
now
and
as
for
work
i
never
saw
his
beat
he
seems
possessed
up
afore
sunrise
every
blessed
morning
and
never
in
bed
till
midnight
and
just
slaving
away
all
between
time
i
said
to
him
day
says
i
si
have
to
let
up
on
this
sort
of
thing
and
take
a
rest
you
ca
stand
it
you
not
a
pointer
pointers
can
stand
anything
but
it
kill
you
he
give
one
of
them
bitter
laughs
of
his
says
he
no
difference
if
it
does
nobody
care
and
off
he
walks
sulky
like
there
something
about
young
si
i
ca
understand
concluded
bentley
ethel
lennox
was
interested
a
melancholy
mysterious
hero
in
a
setting
of
sand
hills
and
wide
blue
sweeps
of
ocean
was
something
that
ought
to
lend
piquancy
to
her
vacation
i
should
like
to
see
this
prince
in
disguise
she
said
it
all
sounds
very
romantic
i
take
you
to
the
shore
after
tea
if
you
like
said
agnes
eagerly
si
just
splendid
she
continued
in
a
confidential
aside
as
they
rose
from
the
table
pa
does
half
like
him
because
he
thinks
there
something
queer
about
him
but
i
do
he
a
gentleman
as
ma
says
i
do
believe
he
done
anything
wrong
ethel
lennox
sauntered
out
into
the
orchard
to
wait
for
agnes
she
sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
began
to
read
but
soon
the
book
slipped
from
her
hands
and
the
beautiful
head
leaned
back
against
the
grey
lichened
trunk
of
the
old
tree
the
sweet
mouth
drooped
wistfully
there
was
a
sad
look
in
the
violet
eyes
the
face
was
not
that
of
a
happy
girl
so
thought
agnes
as
she
came
down
the
apple
tree
avenue
but
how
pretty
she
is
she
thought
wo
the
folks
around
here
stare
at
her
they
always
do
at
our
boarders
but
we
never
had
one
like
her
ethel
sprang
up
i
had
no
idea
you
would
be
here
so
soon
she
said
brightly
just
wait
till
i
get
my
hat
when
she
came
out
they
started
off
and
presently
found
themselves
walking
down
a
grassy
lane
that
ran
through
mown
hay
fields
green
with
their
rich
aftergrowth
and
sheets
of
pale
ripening
oats
and
wheat
until
it
lost
itself
in
the
rolling
sand
hills
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
beyond
the
sand
hills
stretched
the
shining
expanse
of
the
ocean
of
the
faint
bleached
blue
of
hot
august
seas
and
reaching
out
into
a
horizon
laced
with
long
trails
of
pinkish
cloud
numberless
fishing
boats
dotted
the
shimmering
reaches
that
boat
is
young
si
said
agnes
he
always
goes
to
that
particular
spot
is
he
really
all
your
father
says
asked
miss
lennox
curiously
indeed
he
is
he
is
any
more
like
the
rest
of
the
shore
men
than
you
are
he
queer
of
course
i
do
believe
he
happy
it
seems
to
me
he
worrying
over
something
but
i
sure
it
is
nothing
wrong
here
we
are
she
added
as
they
passed
the
sand
hills
and
came
out
on
the
long
level
beach
to
their
left
the
shore
curved
around
in
a
of
dazzling
whiteness
at
their
right
stood
a
small
grey
that
young
si
place
said
agnes
he
lives
there
night
and
day
would
it
make
anyone
melancholy
no
wonder
he
mysterious
going
to
get
his
spyglass
he
told
me
i
might
always
use
it
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
followed
by
ethel
the
interior
was
rough
but
clean
it
was
a
small
room
lighted
by
one
tiny
window
looking
out
on
the
water
in
one
corner
a
rough
ladder
led
up
to
the
loft
above
the
bare
lathed
walls
were
hung
with
fishing
jackets
nets
mackerel
lines
and
other
shore
appurtenances
a
little
stove
bore
a
kettle
and
a
frying
pan
a
low
board
table
was
strewn
with
dishes
and
the
cold
remnants
of
a
hasty
repast
benches
were
placed
along
the
walls
a
fat
bewhiskered
kitten
looking
as
if
it
were
cut
out
of
black
velvet
was
dozing
on
the
window
sill
this
is
young
si
cat
explained
agnes
patting
the
creature
which
purred
joyously
and
opened
its
sleepy
green
eyes
it
the
only
thing
he
cares
for
i
believe
witch
witch
how
are
you
witch
well
here
the
spyglass
let
go
out
and
have
a
look
si
catching
mackerel
announced
agnes
a
few
minutes
later
after
she
had
scrutinized
each
boat
in
turn
and
he
wo
be
in
for
an
hour
yet
if
you
like
we
have
time
for
a
walk
up
the
shore
the
sun
slipped
lower
and
lower
in
the
creamy
sky
leaving
a
trail
of
sparkles
that
ran
across
the
water
and
lost
itself
in
the
west
sea
gulls
soared
and
dipped
and
tiny
sand
peeps
flitted
along
the
beach
just
as
the
red
rim
of
the
sun
dipped
in
the
purpling
sea
the
boats
began
to
come
in
most
of
them
will
go
around
to
the
point
explained
agnes
with
a
contemptuous
sweep
of
her
hand
towards
a
long
headland
running
out
before
them
they
belong
there
and
they
a
rough
crowd
you
catch
young
si
associating
with
the
pointers
there
he
getting
up
sail
we
just
have
time
to
get
back
before
he
comes
in
they
hurried
back
across
the
dampening
sand
as
the
sun
disappeared
leaving
a
fiery
spot
behind
him
the
shore
was
no
longer
quiet
and
deserted
the
little
spot
where
the
fishing
house
stood
had
suddenly
started
into
life
roughly
clad
boys
were
running
hither
and
thither
carrying
fish
or
water
the
boats
were
hauled
up
on
the
skids
a
couple
of
shaggy
old
tars
who
had
strolled
over
from
the
point
to
hear
about
young
si
catch
were
smoking
their
pipes
at
the
corner
of
his
shanty
a
mellow
afterlight
was
shining
over
sea
and
shore
the
whole
scene
delighted
ethel
artist
eyes
agnes
nudged
her
companion
there
if
you
want
to
see
young
si
she
whispered
pointing
to
the
skids
where
a
busy
figure
was
discernible
in
a
large
boat
him
with
his
back
to
us
in
the
boat
he
counting
out
mackerel
if
you
go
over
to
that
platform
behind
him
you
get
a
good
look
when
he
turns
around
i
going
to
coax
a
mackerel
out
of
that
stingy
old
snuffy
if
i
can
she
tripped
off
and
ethel
walked
slowly
over
to
the
boats
the
men
stared
at
her
in
admiration
as
she
passed
them
and
walked
out
on
the
platform
behind
young
si
there
was
no
one
near
the
two
the
others
were
all
assembled
around
snuffy
boat
young
si
was
throwing
out
the
mackerel
with
marvellous
rapidity
but
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
behind
him
he
turned
and
straightened
up
his
tall
form
they
stood
face
to
face
miles
ethel
young
si
staggered
back
against
the
mast
letting
two
silvery
bloaters
slip
through
his
hands
overboard
his
handsome
sunburned
face
was
very
white
ethel
lennox
turned
abruptly
and
silently
and
walked
swiftly
across
the
sand
agnes
felt
her
arm
touched
and
turned
to
see
ethel
standing
pale
and
erect
beside
her
let
us
go
home
said
the
latter
unsteadily
it
is
very
damp
here
i
feel
chilled
oh
dear
exclaimed
agnes
penitently
i
ought
to
have
told
you
to
bring
a
shawl
it
is
always
damp
on
the
shore
after
sunset
here
snuffy
give
me
my
mackerel
thank
you
i
ready
now
miss
lennox
they
reached
the
lane
before
agnes
remembered
to
ask
the
question
ethel
dreaded
oh
did
you
see
young
si
and
what
do
you
think
of
him
ethel
turned
her
face
away
and
answered
with
studied
carelessness
he
seems
to
be
quite
a
superior
fisherman
so
far
as
i
could
see
in
the
dim
light
it
was
very
dusky
there
you
know
let
us
walk
a
little
faster
my
shoes
are
quite
wet
when
they
reached
home
miss
lennox
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
weariness
and
went
straight
to
her
room
back
at
the
shore
young
si
had
recovered
himself
and
stooped
again
to
his
work
his
face
was
set
and
expressionless
a
dull
red
burned
in
each
bronzed
cheek
he
threw
out
the
mackerel
mechanically
but
his
hands
trembled
snuffy
strolled
over
to
the
boat
see
that
handsome
girl
si
he
asked
lazily
one
of
the
bentleys
boarders
i
hear
looks
as
if
she
might
have
stepped
out
of
a
picture
frame
do
she
we
no
time
to
waste
curtis
said
young
si
harshly
with
all
these
fish
to
clean
before
bedtime
stop
talking
and
get
to
work
snuffy
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
obeyed
in
silence
young
si
was
not
a
person
to
be
trifled
with
the
catch
was
large
and
it
was
late
before
they
finished
snuffy
surveyed
the
full
barrels
complacently
good
day
work
he
muttered
but
hard
i
dead
beat
out
i
go
to
bed
in
the
name
o
goodness
si
whar
be
you
to
young
si
had
got
into
a
dory
and
untied
it
he
made
no
answer
but
rowed
out
from
the
shore
snuffy
stared
at
the
dory
blankly
until
it
was
lost
in
the
gloom
ef
that
do
beat
all
he
ejaculated
i
wonder
if
si
is
in
his
right
senses
he
been
actin
quar
right
along
and
now
to
start
off
lord
knows
whar
at
this
hour
o
night
i
really
do
believe
safe
to
stay
here
alone
with
him
snuffy
shook
his
unkempt
head
dubiously
young
si
rowed
steadily
out
over
the
dark
waves
an
eastern
breeze
was
bringing
in
a
damp
sea
fog
that
blurred
darkly
over
the
outlines
of
horizon
and
shore
the
young
fisherman
found
himself
alone
in
a
world
of
water
and
grey
mist
he
stopped
rowing
and
leaned
forward
on
his
oars
to
see
her
here
of
all
places
he
muttered
not
a
word
scarcely
a
look
after
all
this
long
heartbreak
well
perhaps
it
is
better
so
and
yet
to
know
she
is
so
near
how
beautiful
she
is
and
i
love
her
more
than
ever
that
is
where
the
sting
lies
i
thought
that
in
this
rough
life
amid
all
these
rude
associations
where
nothing
could
remind
me
of
her
i
might
forget
and
now
he
clenched
his
hands
the
mist
was
all
around
and
about
him
creeping
impalpable
the
dory
rocked
gently
on
the
swell
from
afar
came
the
low
persistent
murmur
of
the
ocean
the
next
day
ethel
lennox
declined
to
visit
si
shore
instead
she
went
to
the
point
and
sketched
all
day
she
went
again
the
next
day
and
the
next
the
point
was
the
most
picturesque
part
of
the
shore
she
averred
and
the
types
among
its
inhabitants
most
interesting
agnes
bentley
ceased
to
suggest
another
visit
to
si
shore
she
had
a
vague
perception
that
her
companion
did
not
care
to
discuss
the
subject
at
the
end
of
a
week
bentley
remarked
what
in
the
world
can
have
happened
to
young
si
it
a
whole
week
since
he
was
here
for
milk
or
butter
he
ai
sick
is
he
bentley
chuckled
amusedly
i
i
can
tell
you
the
reason
of
that
si
getting
his
stuff
at
walden
now
i
saw
him
going
there
twice
this
week
got
ahead
of
you
at
last
mary
well
i
never
did
said
bentley
well
young
si
is
the
first
that
ever
preferred
walden
butter
to
mine
everyone
knows
what
hers
is
like
she
never
works
her
salt
half
in
well
young
welcome
to
it
i
sure
i
wish
him
joy
of
his
exchange
bentley
rattled
her
dishes
ominously
it
was
plain
her
faith
in
young
si
had
received
a
severe
shock
upstairs
in
her
room
ethel
lennox
with
a
few
undried
tears
glistening
on
her
cheeks
was
writing
a
letter
her
lips
were
compressed
and
her
hand
trembled
i
have
discovered
that
it
is
no
use
to
run
away
from
fate
she
wrote
no
matter
how
hard
we
try
to
elude
it
and
how
sure
we
are
that
we
have
succeeded
it
will
rise
and
meet
us
where
we
least
expect
it
i
came
down
here
tired
and
worn
out
looking
for
peace
and
rest
and
lo
the
most
disquieting
element
of
my
life
is
here
to
confront
me
i
going
to
confess
helen
confession
is
good
for
the
soul
you
know
and
i
shall
treat
myself
to
a
good
dose
while
the
mood
is
on
you
know
of
course
that
i
was
once
engaged
to
miles
lesley
you
also
know
that
that
engagement
was
broken
last
autumn
for
unexplained
reasons
well
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
then
mail
this
letter
speedily
before
i
change
my
mind
it
is
over
a
year
now
since
miles
and
i
first
became
engaged
as
you
are
aware
his
family
is
wealthy
and
noted
for
its
exclusiveness
i
was
a
poor
school
teacher
and
you
may
imagine
with
what
horror
his
relatives
received
the
news
of
miles
attentions
to
one
whom
they
considered
his
inferior
now
that
i
have
thought
the
whole
matter
over
calmly
i
scarcely
blame
them
it
must
be
hard
for
aristocratic
parents
who
have
lavished
every
care
upon
a
son
and
cherished
for
him
the
highest
hopes
when
he
turns
from
the
women
of
his
own
order
to
one
considered
beneath
him
in
station
but
i
did
not
view
the
subject
in
this
light
then
and
instead
of
declining
his
attentions
as
i
perhaps
should
have
done
i
encouraged
them
i
loved
him
so
dearly
nell
and
in
spite
of
family
opposition
miles
soon
openly
declared
his
attachment
when
his
parents
found
they
could
not
change
his
purpose
their
affection
for
him
forced
them
into
outward
acquiescence
but
their
reluctant
condescension
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
me
i
saw
things
only
from
my
own
point
of
view
and
was
keenly
sensitive
to
their
politely
concealed
disapprobation
and
my
offended
vanity
found
its
victim
in
miles
i
belonged
to
the
class
who
admit
and
resent
slights
instead
of
ignoring
them
as
do
the
higher
bred
and
i
thought
he
would
not
see
those
offered
to
me
i
grew
cold
and
formal
to
him
he
was
very
patient
but
his
ways
were
not
mine
and
my
manner
puzzled
and
annoyed
him
our
relations
soon
became
strained
and
the
trifle
necessary
for
an
open
quarrel
was
easily
supplied
one
evening
i
went
to
a
large
at
home
given
by
his
mother
i
knew
but
few
and
as
miles
was
necessarily
busy
with
his
social
duties
to
her
guests
i
was
after
the
first
hurried
greeting
left
unattended
for
a
time
not
being
accustomed
to
such
functions
i
resented
this
as
a
covert
insult
and
in
a
fit
of
jealous
pique
i
blush
to
own
that
i
took
the
revenge
of
a
peasant
maid
and
entered
into
a
marked
flirtation
with
fred
currie
who
had
paid
me
some
attention
before
my
engagement
when
miles
was
at
liberty
to
seek
me
he
found
me
to
all
appearances
quite
absorbed
in
my
companion
and
oblivious
of
his
approach
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
away
nor
did
he
come
near
me
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
went
home
angry
enough
but
so
miserable
and
repentant
that
if
miles
had
been
his
usual
patient
self
when
he
called
the
following
evening
i
would
have
begged
his
forgiveness
but
i
had
gone
too
far
his
mother
was
shocked
by
my
gaucherie
and
he
was
humiliated
and
justly
exasperated
we
had
a
short
bitter
quarrel
i
said
a
great
many
foolish
unpardonable
things
and
finally
i
threw
his
ring
at
him
he
gave
me
a
startled
look
then
in
which
there
was
something
of
contempt
and
went
away
without
another
word
after
my
anger
had
passed
i
was
wretchedly
unhappy
i
realized
how
unworthily
i
had
acted
how
deeply
i
loved
miles
and
how
lonely
and
empty
my
life
would
be
without
him
but
he
did
not
come
back
and
soon
after
i
learned
he
had
gone
away
whither
no
one
knew
but
it
was
supposed
abroad
well
i
buried
my
hopes
and
tears
in
secret
and
went
on
with
my
life
as
people
have
to
do
a
life
in
which
i
have
learned
to
think
and
which
i
hope
has
made
me
nobler
and
better
this
summer
i
came
here
i
heard
much
about
a
certain
mysterious
stranger
known
as
si
who
was
fishing
mackerel
at
this
shore
i
was
very
curious
the
story
sounded
romantic
and
one
evening
i
went
down
to
see
him
i
met
him
face
to
face
and
helen
it
was
miles
lesley
for
one
minute
earth
sky
and
sea
reeled
around
me
the
next
i
remembered
all
and
turned
and
walked
away
he
did
not
follow
you
may
be
sure
that
i
now
religiously
avoid
that
part
of
the
shore
we
have
never
met
since
and
he
has
made
no
effort
to
see
me
he
clearly
shows
that
he
despises
me
well
i
despise
myself
i
am
very
unhappy
nell
and
not
only
on
my
own
account
for
i
feel
that
if
miles
had
never
met
me
his
mother
would
not
now
be
breaking
her
heart
for
her
absent
boy
my
sorrow
has
taught
me
to
understand
hers
and
i
no
longer
resent
her
pride
you
need
hardly
be
told
after
this
that
i
leave
here
in
another
week
i
can
not
fabricate
a
decent
excuse
to
go
sooner
or
i
would
in
the
cool
twilight
ethel
went
with
agnes
bentley
to
mail
her
letter
as
they
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
little
country
store
a
young
man
came
around
the
corner
it
was
young
si
he
was
in
his
rough
fishing
suit
with
a
big
herring
net
trailing
over
his
shoulder
but
no
disguise
could
effectually
conceal
his
splendid
figure
agnes
sprang
forward
eagerly
si
where
have
you
been
why
have
you
never
i
been
up
to
see
us
for
so
long
young
si
made
no
verbal
reply
he
merely
lifted
his
cap
with
formal
politeness
and
turned
on
his
heel
well
i
never
exclaimed
agnes
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
powers
of
speech
if
that
is
how
young
si
is
going
to
treat
his
friends
he
must
have
got
offended
at
something
i
wonder
what
it
is
she
added
her
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
her
indignation
when
they
came
out
they
saw
the
solitary
figure
of
young
si
far
adown
crossing
the
dim
lonely
shore
fields
in
the
dusk
agnes
failed
to
notice
the
pallor
of
her
companion
face
and
the
unshed
tears
in
her
eyes
i
just
been
down
to
the
point
said
agnes
coming
in
one
sultry
afternoon
about
a
week
later
and
little
ev
said
as
there
was
no
fishing
today
he
take
us
out
for
that
sail
tonight
if
you
wanted
to
go
ethel
lennox
put
her
drawing
away
listlessly
she
looked
pale
and
tired
she
was
going
away
the
next
day
and
this
was
to
be
her
last
visit
to
the
shore
about
an
hour
before
sunset
a
boat
glided
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
point
in
it
were
ethel
lennox
and
agnes
together
with
little
ev
the
undersized
pointer
who
owned
the
boat
the
evening
was
fine
and
an
breeze
was
freshening
up
rapidly
they
did
not
notice
the
long
dark
bank
of
livid
cloud
low
in
the
northwest
is
this
glorious
exclaimed
ethel
her
hat
was
straining
back
from
her
head
and
the
red
rings
of
her
hair
were
blowing
about
her
face
agnes
looked
about
her
more
anxiously
wiser
in
matters
of
sea
and
shore
than
her
companion
there
were
some
indications
she
did
not
like
young
si
who
was
standing
with
snuffy
their
skids
lowered
his
spyglass
with
a
start
it
is
agnes
bentley
and
and
that
boarder
of
theirs
he
said
anxiously
and
they
gone
out
with
little
ev
in
that
wretched
leaky
tub
of
his
where
are
their
eyes
that
they
ca
see
a
squall
coming
up
an
little
ev
do
know
as
much
about
managing
a
boat
as
a
cat
exclaimed
snuffy
excitedly
sign
to
come
back
si
shook
his
head
they
too
far
out
i
do
know
that
the
squall
will
amount
to
very
much
in
a
good
boat
with
someone
who
knew
how
to
manage
it
they
be
all
right
but
with
little
ev
he
began
walking
restlessly
up
and
down
the
narrow
platform
the
boat
was
now
some
distance
out
the
breeze
had
stiffened
to
a
slow
strong
wind
and
the
level
of
the
sea
was
whipped
into
agnes
bent
towards
ethel
it
getting
too
rough
i
think
we
better
go
back
i
afraid
we
in
for
a
thunder
squall
look
at
the
clouds
a
long
sullen
muttering
verified
her
words
little
ev
she
shouted
we
want
to
go
in
little
ev
thus
recalled
to
things
about
him
looked
around
in
alarm
the
girls
questioned
each
other
with
glances
of
dismay
the
sky
had
grown
very
black
and
the
peals
of
thunder
came
louder
and
more
continuously
a
jagged
bolt
of
lightning
hurtled
over
the
horizon
over
land
and
sea
was
the
green
malignant
light
of
coming
storm
little
ev
brought
the
boat
head
abruptly
round
as
a
few
heavy
drops
of
rain
fell
ev
the
boat
is
leaking
shrieked
agnes
above
the
wind
the
water
coming
in
bail
her
out
then

white
rain

boat
to
the

like
a
cat
and
little
ev
jumped
just
as
a
thunderous
crash
seemed
to
burst
above
them
and
air
and
sky
were
filled
with
blue
flame
the
danger
was
past
for
the
squall
had
few
difficulties
for
si
and
snuffy
when
they
reached
the
shore
agnes
who
had
quite
recovered
from
her
fright
tucked
her
dripping
skirts
about
her
and
announced
her
determination
to
go
straight
home
with
snuffy
i

shanty
si
and
let
her
get

i
be
as
quick
as
i
can
si
picked
ethel
up
in
his
strong
arms
and
carried
her
into
the
he
placed
her
on
one
of
the
low
benches
and
hurriedly
began
to
kindle
a
fire
ethel
sat
up
dazedly
and
pushed
back
the
dripping
masses
of
her
bright
hair
young
si
turned
and
looked
down
at
her
with
a
passionate
light
in
his
eyes
she
put
out
her
cold
wet
hands
wistfully
oh
miles
she
whispered
outside
the
wind
shook
the
frail
building
and
tore
the
shuddering
sea
to
pieces
the
rain
poured
down
it
was
already
settling
in
for
a
night
of
storm
but
inside
young
si
fire
was
casting
cheery
flames
over
the
rude
room
and
young
si
himself
was
kneeling
by
ethel
lennox
with
his
arm
about
her
and
her
head
on
his
broad
shoulder
there
were
happy
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
voice
quivered
as
she
said
miles
can
you
forgive
me
if
you
knew
how
bitterly
i
have
repented
never
speak
of
the
past
again
my
sweet
in
my
lonely
days
and
nights
down
here
by
the
sea
i
have
forgotten
all
but
my
love
miles
how
did
you
come
here
i
thought
you
were
in
europe
i
did
travel
at
first
i
came
down
here
by
chance
and
resolved
to
cut
myself
utterly
adrift
from
my
old
life
and
see
if
i
could
not
forget
you
i
was
not
very
successful
he
smiled
down
into
her
eyes
and
you
were
going
away
tomorrow
how
perilously
near
we
have
been
to
not
meeting
but
how
are
we
going
to
explain
all
this
to
our
friends
along
shore
i
think
we
had
better
not
explain
it
at
all
i
will
go
away
tomorrow
as
i
intended
and
you
can
quietly
follow
soon
let
si
remain
the
mystery
he
has
always
been
that
will
be
best
decidedly
so
they
would
never
understand
if
we
did
tell
them
and
i
daresay
they
would
be
very
much
disappointed
to
find
i
was
not
a
murderer
or
a
forger
or
something
of
that
sort
they
have
always
credited
me
with
an
evil
past
and
you
and
i
will
go
back
to
our
own
world
ethel
you
will
be
welcome
there
now
sweet
my
family
too
have
learned
a
lesson
and
will
do
anything
to
promote
my
happiness
agnes
drove
ethel
lennox
to
the
station
next
day
the
fierce
wind
that
had
swept
over
land
and
sea
seemed
to
have
blown
away
all
the
hazy
vapours
and
oppressive
heats
in
the
air
and
the
morning
dawned
as
clear
and
fresh
as
if
the
sad
old
earth
with
all
her
passionate
tears
had
cleansed
herself
from
sin
and
stain
and
come
forth
radiantly
pure
and
sweet
ethel
bubbled
over
with
joyousness
agnes
wondered
at
the
change
in
her
miss
lennox
she
said
wistfully
you
come
back
to
see
us
some
time
again
wo
you
perhaps
smiled
ethel
and
if
not
agnes
you
must
come
and
see
me
some
day
i
may
tell
you
a
secret
about
a
week
later
young
si
suddenly
vanished
and
his
disappearance
was
a
talk
along
shore
his
departure
was
as
mysterious
as
his
advent
it
leaked
out
that
he
had
quietly
disposed
of
his
boat
and
shanty
to
snuffy
curtis
sent
his
mackerel
off
and
that
done
slipped
from
the
pointers
lives
never
more
to
them
little
ev
was
the
last
of
the
pointers
to
see
him
tramping
along
the
road
to
the
station
in
the
dusk
of
the
autumn
twilight
and
the
next
morning
agnes
bentley
going
out
of
doors
before
the
others
found
on
the
doorstep
a
basket
containing
a
small
vociferous
black
kitten
with
a
card
attached
to
its
neck
on
it
was
written
will
agnes
please
befriend
witch
in
memory
of
young
si
