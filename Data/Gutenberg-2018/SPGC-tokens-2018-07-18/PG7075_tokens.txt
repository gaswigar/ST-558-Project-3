i
in
the
of
a
fine
house
on
the
boulevard
raspail
all
the
darbois
family
were
gathered
together
about
the
round
table
on
which
a
white
oil
cloth
bordered
with
portraits
of
the
line
of
french
kings
served
as
table
cover
at
family
meals
the
darbois
family
consisted
of
françois
darbois
professor
of
philosophy
a
scholar
of
eminence
and
distinction
of
madame
darbois
his
wife
a
charming
gentle
little
creature
without
any
pretentions
of
philippe
renaud
brother
of
madame
darbois
an
honest
and
able
business
man
of
his
son
maurice
renaud
and
a
painter
a
fine
youth
filled
with
confidence
because
of
the
success
he
had
just
achieved
at
the
last
salon
of
a
distant
cousin
the
family
counsellor
a
tyrannical
landlord
and
bachelor
adhemar
meydieux
and
the
child
of
whom
he
was
godfather
and
around
whom
all
this
particular
little
world
revolved
esperance
darbois
the
only
daughter
of
the
philosopher
was
fifteen
years
old
she
was
long
and
slim
without
being
angular
the
flower
head
that
crowned
this
slender
stem
was
exquisitely
fair
with
the
fairness
of
a
little
child
soft
fair
her
face
had
indeed
no
strictly
sculptural
beauty
her
long
eyes
were
not
large
her
nose
had
no
special
character
only
her
sensitive
and
nostrils
gave
the
pretty
face
its
suggestion
of
ancient
lineage
her
mouth
was
a
little
large
and
her
full
red
lips
opened
on
singularly
white
teeth
as
even
as
almonds
while
a
low
grecian
forehead
and
a
neck
graceful
in
every
curve
gave
esperance
a
total
effect
of
aristocratic
distinction
that
was
beyond
dispute
her
low
vibrant
voice
produced
an
impression
that
was
almost
physical
on
those
who
heard
it
quite
without
intention
she
introduced
into
every
word
she
spoke
several
inflections
which
made
her
manner
of
pronounciation
peculiarly
her
own
esperance
was
kneeling
on
a
chair
leaning
upon
her
arms
on
the
table
her
blue
dress
cut
like
a
blouse
was
held
in
at
the
waist
by
a
narrow
girdle
knotted
loosely
although
the
child
was
arguing
vigorously
with
intense
animation
there
was
such
grace
in
her
gestures
such
charming
vibrations
in
her
voice
that
it
was
impossible
to
resent
her
combative
attitude
papa
my
dear
papa
she
was
asserting
to
françois
darbois
you
are
saying
just
the
opposite
of
what
you
were
saying
the
other
day
to
mother
at
dinner
her
father
raised
his
head
her
mother
on
the
contrary
dropped
hers
a
little
pray
heaven
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
françois
does
not
get
angry
with
her
the
godfather
moved
his
chair
forward
philippe
renaud
laughed
maurice
looked
at
his
cousin
with
amazement
what
are
you
saying
asked
françois
darbois
esperance
gazed
at
him
tenderly
you
remember
my
godfather
was
dining
with
us
and
there
had
been
a
lot
of
talk
my
godfather
was
against
allowing
any
liberty
to
women
and
he
maintained
that
children
have
no
right
to
choose
their
own
careers
but
must
without
reasoning
give
way
to
their
parents
who
alone
are
to
decide
their
fates
adhemar
wished
to
take
the
floor
and
cleared
his
throat
in
preparation
but
françois
darbois
evidently
a
little
nonplused
muttered
and
then
after
that
what
are
you
coming
to
to
what
you
answered
papa
her
father
looked
at
her
a
little
anxiously
but
she
met
his
glance
calmly
and
continued
you
said
to
my
godfather
dear
meydieux
you
are
absolutely
mistaken
it
is
the
right
and
the
duty
of
everyone
to
select
and
to
construct
his
future
for
himself
darbois
attempted
to
speak
you
even
told
mama
who
had
never
known
it
that
grandfather
wanted
to
place
you
in
business
and
that
you
rebelled
ah
rebelled
murmured
darbois
with
a
slight
shrug
yes
rebelled
and
you
added
father
cut
off
my
allowance
for
a
year
but
i
stuck
to
it
i
tutored
poor
students
who
could
get
through
their
examinations
i
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
but
i
did
live
and
i
was
able
to
continue
my
studies
in
philosophy
uncle
renaud
was
openly
nodding
encouragement
adhemar
meydieux
rose
heavily
and
straightening
up
with
a
succession
of
jerky
movements
caught
himself
squarely
on
his
heels
and
then
with
great
conviction
said
see
here
child
if
i
were
your
father
i
should
take
you
by
the
ear
and
put
you
out
of
the
room
esperance
turned
purple
i
repeat
children
should
obey
without
question
i
hope
to
prove
to
my
daughter
by
reasoning
that
she
is
probably
wrong
said
darbois
very
quietly
not
at
all
you
must
order
not
persuade
now
meydieux
exclaimed
the
young
painter
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
going
a
little
too
far
children
should
respect
their
wishes
as
far
as
possible
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
their
own
future
they
have
a
right
to
present
their
side
of
the
case
if
my
uncle
darbois
father
had
had
his
way
my
uncle
darbois
would
probably
now
be
a
mediocre
engineer
instead
of
the
brilliant
philosopher
who
is
admired
and
recognized
by
the
entire
world
gentle
little
madame
darbois
sat
up
proudly
and
esperance
looked
at
her
father
with
a
world
of
tenderness
in
her
eyes
but
my
lad
pursued
adhemar
swelling
with
conviction
your
uncle
might
well
have
made
a
fortune
at
machinery
while
as
it
is
he
has
just
managed
to
exist
we
are
very
happy
madame
darbois
slipped
in
her
word
esperance
had
bounded
out
of
her
chair
and
from
behind
her
father
encircled
his
head
with
her
arms
oh
yes
very
happy
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
and
you
would
not
darling
papa
spoil
the
harmony
of
our
life
together
remember
my
dear
little
esperance
what
i
said
to
your
mother
concerned
only
men
now
we
are
considering
the
future
of
a
young
girl
and
that
is
a
graver
matter
why
because
men
are
better
armed
against
the
struggle
and
life
is
alas
one
eternal
combat
the
armour
of
the
intellect
is
the
same
for
a
young
girl
as
for
a
young
man
adhemar
shook
his
shoulders
impatiently
seeing
that
he
was
getting
angry
and
was
like
to
explode
esperance
cried
out
wait
godfather
you
must
let
me
try
to
convince
my
parents
suppose
father
that
i
had
chosen
the
same
career
as
maurice
what
different
armour
should
i
need
françois
listened
to
his
daughter
affectionately
drawing
her
closer
to
him
understand
me
my
dearie
i
am
not
denying
your
wish
as
a
proof
of
my
parental
authority
no
remember
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
expressed
your
will
in
the
matter
of
the
choice
of
your
career
the
first
time
i
asked
you
to
consider
it
for
six
months
the
six
months
having
passed
you
now
place
me
under
the
obligation
of
oh
papa
what
a
horrid
word
but
that
is
it
he
went
on
playing
with
her
pretty
hair
you
have
put
me
under
the
obligation
of
answering
you
definitely
and
i
have
called
this
family
council
because
i
have
not
the
courage
nor
perhaps
the
right
to
stand
in
your
way
the
way
you
wish
to
go
adhemar
made
a
violent
effort
to
leap
to
his
feet
declaiming
in
his
heavy
voice
yes
françois
you
must
try
and
prevent
her
from
going
this
way
the
most
evil
the
most
perilous
above
all
for
a
woman
esperance
began
to
tremble
but
she
stood
resolutely
away
from
her
father
holding
herself
rigid
with
her
arms
hanging
straight
at
her
sides
the
rose
tint
of
her
cheeks
had
disappeared
and
her
blue
eyes
were
dimmed
with
shadows
maurice
hastily
made
a
number
of
sketches
of
her
never
before
had
he
found
his
cousin
so
interesting
adhemar
continued
pray
allow
me
to
proceed
with
what
i
have
to
say
my
dear
child
i
have
come
from
the
country
for
this
purpose
in
answer
to
your
father
summons
i
wish
to
offer
my
experience
for
your
protection
your
parents
know
nothing
of
life
françois
breathes
the
ether
of
a
world
peopled
only
by
philosophers
whether
dead
or
living
it
makes
little
difference
your
mother
lives
only
for
you
two
i
expressed
at
once
my
horror
at
the
career
that
you
have
chosen
i
expatiated
upon
all
the
dangers
you
seem
to
have
understood
nothing
and
your
father
thanks
to
his
philosophy
that
least
trustworthy
of
guides
continues
futilely
reasoning
for
ever
reasoning
his
harangue
was
cut
short
esperance
clear
voice
broke
in
i
do
not
wish
to
hear
you
speak
in
this
manner
of
my
father
godfather
she
said
coldly
my
father
lives
for
my
mother
and
me
he
is
good
and
generous
it
is
you
who
are
the
egoist
godfather
françois
started
as
if
to
check
his
daughter
but
she
continued
when
mama
was
so
sick
six
years
ago
papa
sent
me
with
marguerite
our
maid
to
take
a
letter
to
you
i
did
so
want
to
read
that
letter
it
must
have
been
so
splendid
you
answered
adhemar
tried
to
get
in
a
word
esperance
in
exasperation
tapped
the
floor
with
her
foot
and
rushed
on
you
answered
one
you
must
tell
your
papa
that
i
will
give
him
all
the
advice
he
wants
to
help
him
out
of
this
trouble
but
it
is
a
principle
of
mine
never
to
lend
money
above
all
to
my
good
friends
for
that
always
leads
to
a
quarrel
then
i
left
you
and
went
to
my
uncle
renaud
who
gave
me
a
great
deal
more
even
than
we
needed
for
mama
big
renaud
looked
hot
and
uncomfortable
his
son
pressed
his
hand
so
affectionately
under
the
table
that
the
good
man
eyes
grew
wet
ever
since
then
godfather
i
have
not
cared
for
you
any
more
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
room
seemed
suddenly
to
congeal
the
silence
was
intense
adhemar
himself
remained
thunderstruck
in
his
chair
his
tongue
dry
his
thoughts
chaotic
unable
to
form
a
reply
to
the
child
virulent
attack
for
the
sake
of
breaking
up
this
general
paralysis
maurice
renaud
finally
suggested
that
they
should
vote
upon
the
decision
to
be
given
to
his
brave
little
cousin
they
gathered
together
around
the
table
and
began
to
talk
in
low
tones
esperance
had
sunk
into
a
chair
her
face
was
very
pale
and
great
blue
circles
had
appeared
around
her
eyes
the
discussion
seemed
to
be
once
more
in
full
swing
when
maurice
startled
everyone
by
crying
my
god
esperance
is
ill
the
child
had
fainted
and
her
head
hung
limply
back
her
golden
hair
made
an
aureola
of
light
around
the
colourless
face
with
its
dead
white
lips
maurice
raised
the
child
in
his
arms
and
madame
darbois
led
him
quickly
to
esperance
little
room
where
he
laid
the
light
form
on
its
little
bed
françois
darbois
moistened
her
temples
quickly
with
eau
de
cologne
madame
darbois
supported
esperance
head
holding
a
little
ether
to
her
nose
as
maurice
looked
about
the
little
room
as
fresh
as
white
as
the
two
pots
of
marguerites
on
the
an
indefinable
sentiment
swelled
up
within
him
was
it
a
kind
of
adoration
for
so
much
purity
philippe
renaud
had
remained
in
the
where
he
succeeded
in
keeping
adhemar
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
follow
the
darbois
esperance
opened
her
eyes
and
seeing
beside
her
only
her
father
and
mother
those
two
beings
whom
she
loved
so
deeply
so
tenderly
she
reached
out
her
arms
and
drew
close
to
her
their
beloved
heads
maurice
had
slipped
out
very
quietly
papa
dearie
mama
beloved
forgive
me
it
is
not
my
fault
she
sobbed
do
cry
my
child
now
not
a
tear
cried
darbois
bending
over
his
little
girl
it
is
settled
you
shall
be
and
the
word
was
lost
in
her
little
ear
she
went
suddenly
pink
and
raising
herself
towards
him
whispered
her
reply
oh
i
thank
you
how
i
love
you
both
thank
you
thank
you
chapter
ii
esperance
left
alone
with
her
mother
drank
the
tea
this
tender
parent
brought
to
her
and
the
look
of
health
began
to
come
back
to
her
face
then
mother
dearest
we
must
go
and
be
registered
for
the
examinations
that
are
soon
to
be
held
at
the
conservatoire
you
want
to
go
yes
we
must
stay
with
papa
must
we
he
is
so
kind
the
two
mother
and
daughter
were
silent
a
moment
occupied
with
the
same
tender
thoughts
and
now
we
will
persuade
him
to
go
out
with
us
sha
we
mother
dear
that
will
be
the
very
best
thing
for
both
of
you
agreed
madame
darbois
and
she
went
to
make
her
preparations
left
alone
esperance
cast
aside
her
blue
dress
and
surveyed
herself
in
the
long
mirror
her
eyes
were
asking
the
questions
that
perplexed
her
whole
being
she
raised
herself
lightly
on
her
little
feet
oh
yes
surely
i
am
going
to
be
tall
i
am
only
fifteen
and
i
am
quite
tall
for
my
age
oh
yes
i
shall
be
tall
she
came
very
close
to
the
mirror
and
examined
herself
closely
hypnotizing
herself
little
by
little
she
beheld
herself
under
a
million
different
aspects
her
whole
life
seemed
passing
before
her
shadowy
figures
came
and
went
one
of
them
the
most
persistent
seemed
to
keep
stretching
towards
her
long
appealing
arms
she
shivered
recoiled
abruptly
and
passing
her
hand
across
her
forehead
dispelled
the
dizzy
visions
that
were
gathering
there
when
her
mother
returned
she
found
her
quietly
reading
victor
hugo
studying
in
she
had
not
heard
the
opening
of
the
door
and
she
started
at
finding
her
mother
close
beside
her
you
see
i
am
not
going
to
lose
any
time
she
said
closing
the
book
ah
mama
how
happy
i
am
how
happy
quick
said
her
mother
her
finger
to
her
lips
your
father
is
waiting
for
us
ready
to
go
out
esperance
seized
her
hat
and
coat
quickly
and
ran
to
join
her
father
he
was
sitting
as
if
thinking
his
head
resting
in
his
hands
she
understood
the
struggle
between
love
and
reason
in
his
soul
and
her
upright
little
soul
suffered
with
his
bending
gently
beside
him
she
murmured
do
not
be
unhappy
papa
you
know
that
i
can
never
suffer
as
long
as
i
have
you
two
if
i
am
quite
mistaken
if
life
bring
me
any
of
the
things
that
i
expect
i
shall
find
comfort
in
your
love
françois
darbois
raised
his
head
and
looked
deep
into
the
lovely
eyes
god
keep
you
my
little
daughter
next
morning
esperance
was
ready
to
go
to
the
conservatoire
long
before
the
appointed
hour
darbois
was
already
in
his
study
with
one
of
his
pupils
so
she
ran
to
her
mother
room
and
found
her
busy
with
some
papers
you
have
my
birth
certificate
yes
yes
and
papa
written
consent
yes
yes
sighed
madame
darbois
he
hesitated
to
give
it
to
you
oh
no
you
know
your
father
his
word
is
sacred
but
it
cost
him
a
great
deal
my
dear
little
girl
never
let
him
regret
it
esperance
put
her
finger
across
her
mother
lips
mama
you
know
that
i
am
honest
and
honourable
how
can
i
help
it
when
i
am
the
child
of
two
darlings
as
good
as
you
and
papa
my
longing
for
the
theatre
is
stronger
than
i
can
tell
i
believe
that
if
papa
had
refused
his
permission
it
would
have
made
me
unhappy
and
that
i
should
have
fallen
ill
and
pined
away
you
remember
how
about
a
year
ago
i
almost
died
of
anaemia
and
consumption
really
mother
dear
my
illness
was
simply
caused
by
my
overstrung
nerves
i
had
often
heard
papa
express
his
disapproval
of
the
theatre
and
you
you
remember
said
one
day
in
reference
to
the
suicide
of
a
actress
her
poor
mother
god

me
from
seeing
my
daughter
on
the
stage
madame
darbois
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
two
tears
rolled
quietly
from
beneath
her
eyelids
and
a
little
sob
escaped
her
ah

esperance

effort

my
way
madame
darbois
trembled
she
was
familiar
with
her
daughter
nervous
temperament
in
a
tone
of
more
authority
than
esperance
had
ever
heard
her
use
come
child
be
quick
we
are
losing
time
she
said
i
have
all
the
necessary
papers
come
they
found
at
the
conservatoire
several
women
who
had
arrived
before
them
waiting
to
have
their
daughters
entered
for
the
course
four
youths
were
standing
in
a
separate
group
staring
at
the
young
girls
beside
their
mothers
in
a
corner
of
the
room
was
a
little
office
where
the
official
charged
with
receiving
applications
was
ensconced
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
gruff
jaundiced
from
liver
trouble
looking
down
superciliously
at
the
girls
whose
names
he
had
just
received
when
madame
darbois
entered
with
esperance
the
distinguished
manner
of
the
two
ladies
caused
a
little
stir
the
group
of
young
men
drew
nearer
madame
darbois
looked
about
and
seeing
an
empty
bench
near
a
window
went
towards
it
with
her
daughter
the
sun
falling
upon
esperance
blonde
hair
turned
it
suddenly
into
an
aureola
of
gold
a
murmur
as
of
admiration
broke
from
the
spectators
now
there
is
someone
murmured
a
big
fat
woman
with
her
hands
stuffed
into
white
cotton
gloves
who
may
be
sure
of
her
future
the
official
raised
his
head
dazzled
by
the
radiant
vision
forgetting
the
lack
of
courtesy
he
had
shown
those
who
had
preceded
her
he
advanced
towards
madame
darbois
and
raising
his
black
velvet
cap
do
you
wish
to
register
for
the
entrance
examinations
he
said
to
esperance
she
indicated
her
mother
with
an
impatient
movement
of
her
little
head
yes
said
madame
darbois
but
i
come
after
these
other
people
i
will
wait
my
turn
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
assurance
please
follow
me
ladies
they
rose
a
sound
of
discontent
was
audible
silence
cried
the
official
in
fury
if
i
hear
any
more
noise
i
will
turn
you
all
out
silence
descended
again
many
of
these
women
had
come
a
long
way
a
little
dressmaker
had
left
her
workshop
to
bring
her
daughter
a
big
chambermaid
had
obtained
the
morning
leave
from
the
bourgeois
house
where
she
worked
her
daughter
stood
beside
her
a
beautiful
child
of
sixteen
with
colourless
hair
impudent
as
a
magpie
a
music
teacher
with
boots
had
excused
herself
from
her
pupils
her
two
daughters
flanked
her
to
right
and
left
parisian
blossoms
pale
and
anaemic
both
wished
to
pass
the
entrance
examinations
the
one
as
an
ingenue
in
comedy
the
other
in
tragedy
they
were
neither
comic
nor
tragic
but
modest
and
charming
there
was
also
a
small
covered
with
jewels
she
sat
very
rigid
far
forward
on
the
bench
compressed
into
a
terrible
corset
which
forced
her
breast
and
back
into
the
humps
of
a
punchinello
her
legs
hanging
just
short
of
the
floor
her
daughter
paced
up
and
down
the
long
room
like
a
colt
snorting
impatiently
to
be
put
through
its
paces
she
had
the
beauty
of
a
classic
type
without
spot
or
blemish
but
her
joints
looked
too
heavy
and
her
neck
was
thrust
without
grace
between
her
large
shoulders
anyone
who
looked
into
the
future
would
have
been
able
to
predict
for
her
with
some
certainty
an
honourable
career
as
a
tragedian
in
the
provinces
madame
darbois
seated
herself
on
the
only
chair
in
the
little
office
when
the
official
had
read
esperance
birth
certificate
he
exclaimed
what
mademoiselle
is
the
daughter
of
the
famous
professor
of
philosophy
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
with
amazement
why
ladies
went
on
the
official
radiantly
my
son
is
taking
courses
with
darbois
at
the
sorbonne
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
meet
you
but
how
does
it
happen
that
darbois
has
allowed
his
sentence
died
in
his
throat
madame
darbois
had
become
very
pale
and
her
daughter
nostrils
quivered
the
official
finished
with
his
papers
returned
them
politely
to
madame
darbois
and
said
in
a
low
tone
have
no
anxiety
madame
the
little
lady
has
a
wonderful
future
before
her
the
two
ladies
thanked
the
official
and
made
their
way
toward
the
door
the
group
of
young
men
bowed
to
the
young
girl
and
she
inclined
her
head
ever
so
slightly
oh
screamed
the
big
esperance
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
looked
directly
at
the
woman
who
blushed
and
said
nothing
more
ho
ho
jeered
one
of
the
youths
she
settled
you
finely
that
time
did
she
an
argument
ensued
instantly
but
esperance
had
gone
her
way
trembling
with
happiness
everything
in
life
seemed
opening
for
her
for
the
first
time
she
was
aware
of
her
own
individuality
for
the
first
time
she
recognized
in
herself
a
force
would
that
force
work
for
creation
or
destruction
the
child
pressed
her
hands
against
her
fluttering
heart
darbois
was
waiting
at
the
window
at
sight
of
him
esperance
jumped
from
the
carriage
before
it
stopped
what
a
little
creature
of
extremes
mused
the
professor
when
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
to
thank
him
he
loosed
her
hands
quickly
come
come
we
have
time
to
talk
of
that
we
must
sit
down
at
once
marguerite
is
scolding
because
the
dinner
is
going
to
be
spoiled
to
esperance
the
dinner
was
of
less
than
no
importance
but
she
threw
aside
her
hat
obediently
pulled
forward
her
father
chair
and
sat
down
between
the
two
beings
whom
she
adored
but
whom
she
was
forced
to
see
suffer
if
she
lived
in
her
own
joy
and
that
she
could
not
and
would
not
hide
chapter
iii
the
weeks
before
the
day
of
the
examination
went
by
all
too
slowly
to
suit
esperance
she
had
chosen
for
the
comedy
test
to
study
a
scene
from
femmes
the
rôle
of
and
in
tragedy
a
scene
from
adhemar
meydieux
often
came
to
inquire
about
his
studies
he
wished
to
hear
her
recite
to
give
her
advice
but
esperance
refused
energetically
still
remembering
his
former
opposition
against
him
she
would
let
no
one
hear
her
recitations
but
her
mother
madame
darbois
put
all
her
heart
into
her
efforts
to
help
her
daughter
every
morning
she
went
through
her
work
with
esperance
to
her
the
rôle
of
was
inexplicable
she
consulted
her
husband
who
replied
is
a
little
philosopheress
with
plenty
of
sense
esperance
is
right
to
have
chosen
this
scene
from
femmes
molière
genius
has
never
exhibited
finer
raillery
than
in
this
play
and
he
enlarged
upon
the
psychology
of
character
until
madame
darbois
realized
with
surprise
that
her
daughter
was
completely
in
accord
with
the
ideas
laid
down
by
her
father
as
to
the
interpretation
of
this
rôle
esperance
was
so
young
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
yet
understand
all
the
double
subtleties
esperance
had
taken
her
first
communion
when
she
was
eleven
and
after
her
religious
studies
ended
she
had
thought
of
nothing
but
poetry
and
had
even
tried
to
compose
some
verses
her
father
had
encouraged
her
and
procured
her
a
professor
of
literature
from
that
time
the
child
had
given
herself
completely
to
the
art
of
the
drama
learning
by
heart
and
reciting
aloud
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
french
literature
her
parents
listening
with
pleasure
to
her
recitations
of
ronsard
or
victor
hugo
little
guessing
that
the
child
was
already
dreaming
of
the
theatre
often
since
then
madame
darbois
had
reproached
herself
for
having
foreseen
so
little
but
her
husband
whose
wisdom
recognized
the
uselessness
of
vain
regrets
would
calm
her
saying
with
a
shake
of
his
head
you
can
prevent
nothing
my
dear
wife
destiny
is
a
force
against
which
all
is
impotent
we
can
but
remove
the
from
the
path
which
esperance
must
follow
we
must
be
patient
at
last
the
day
arrived
never
had
the
young
girl
been
more
charming
françois
darbois
had
been
working
arduously
on
the
correction
of
a
book
he
was
about
to
publish
when
he
saw
her
coming
into
his
library
he
turned
towards
her
and
regarding
her
there
in
the
doorway
seemed
to
see
the
archangel
of
victory
such
radiance
emanated
from
this
frail
little
body
i
wanted
to
kiss
you
father
before
going
there
pardon
me
for
having
disturbed
you
he
pressed
her
close
against
his
heart
without
speaking
unwilling
to
pronounce
the
words
of
regret
that
mounted
to
his
lips
esperance
was
silent
for
an
instant
before
her
father
grief
then
with
an
exaltation
of
her
whole
being
she
flung
herself
on
her
father
neck
oh
father
dear
father
i
am
so
happy
that
you
must
not
suffer
you
love
me
so
much
that
you
must
be
happy
in
this
happiness
i
owe
to
you
perhaps
will
bring
me
tears
let
us
live
for
the
professor
gently
stroked
his
daughter
velvet
cheek
go
my
darling
go
and
return
triumphant
in
the
esperance
and
madame
darbois
went
to
the
same
bench
where
they
had
sat
upon
their
former
visit
some
fifty
people
were
assembled
the
same
official
came
to
speak
to
them
and
consulting
the
list
which
he
was
holding
ostentatiously
there
are
still
five
pupils
before
you
mademoiselle
two
boys
and
three
young
ladies
whom
have
you
chosen
to
give
you
your
cues
esperance
looked
at
him
with
amazement
i
do
understand
she
said
madame
darbois
was
perturbed
but
answered
the
man
you
must
have
an
for
femmes
an
and
a
for
but
we
did
not
know
that
stammered
madame
darbois
the
official
smiled
and
assumed
still
more
importance
wait
just
a
moment
ladies
soon
he
returned
leading
a
tall
young
girl
with
a
dignified
bearing
and
a
young
man
of
evident
refinement
here
is
mlle
hardouin
who
is
willing
to
give
you
the
cues
for
and
and
jean
perliez
who
will
do
the
only
i
believe
he
added
you
will
have
to
rehearse
with
them
i
will
take
all
four
of
you
into
my
little
office
where
no
one
can
disturb
you
mlle
hardouin
was
a
beautiful
modest
young
girl
of
eighteen
with
charming
manners
she
was
an
orphan
and
lived
with
a
sister
ten
years
older
who
had
been
a
mother
to
her
they
adored
each
other
the
older
sister
had
established
a
good
trade
for
herself
as
a
dressmaker
both
sisters
were
respected
and
loved
jean
perliez
was
the
son
of
a
chemist
his
father
had
been
unwilling
that
he
should
choose
a
theatrical
career
until
he
should
have
completed
his
studies
at
college
he
had
obeyed
graduated
brilliantly
and
was
now
presenting
himself
for
the
entrance
examination
as
a
tragedian
the
three
young
people
went
over
the
two
scenes
esperance
had
chosen
together
what
a
pretty
voice
you
have
mademoiselle
said
genevieve
hardouin
timidly
after
the
rehearsal
of
femmes
when
they
finished
the
scene
of
jean
perliez
turned
to
madame
darbois
and
inquired
the
name
of
esperance
instructor
why
she
had
none
my
daughter
has
worked
alone
i
have
given
her
the
cues
she
smiled
that
benevolent
smile
which
always
lighted
her
features
with
a
charm
of
true
goodness
and
distinction
that
is
indeed
remarkable
murmured
jean
perliez
as
he
looked
at
the
young
girl
then
bending
towards
madame
darbois
may
i
be
permitted
madame
to
ask
your
daughter
to
give
me
the
cues
of
in
the
young
lady
who
was
to
have
played
it
is
madame
darbois
hesitated
to
reply
and
looked
towards
esperance
oh
yes
mama
of
course
you
will
let
me
said
that
young
lady
in
great
spirits
and
without
more
ado
we
must
rehearse
must
we
not
let
us
begin
at
once
the
young
man
offered
her
the
lines
i
do
need
them
she
said
laughing
i
know
by
heart
and
indeed
the
rehearsal
passed
off
without
a
slip
and
the
little
cast
separated
after
exchanging
the
most
enthusiastic
expressions
of
pleasure
a
comrade
asked
perliez
is
she
any
good
that
pretty
little
blonde
very
good
perliez
replied
curtly
everything
went
well
for
esperance
her
appearance
on
the
miniature
stage
where
the
examinations
were
held
caused
a
little
sensation
among
the
what
a
heavenly
child
exclaimed
victorien
sardou
here
is
truly
the
beauty
of
a
noble
race
murmured
delaunay
the
member
of
the
the
musical
purity
of
esperance
voice
roused
the
assembly
immediately
out
of
its
torpor
the
judges
no
longer
bored
and
indifferent
followed
her
words
with
breathless
attention
and
when
she
stopped
a
low
murmur
of
admiration
was
wafted
to
her
scene
from
rasped
the
voice
of
the
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
announcements
there
was
a
sound
of
chairs
being
dragged
forward
and
the
members
of
the
jury
settling
themselves
to
the
best
advantage
for
listening
here
in
itself
was
a
miniature
triumph
repressed
by
the
dignity
assumed
by
all
the
judges
but
which
esperance
appreciated
none
the
less
she
bowed
with
the
sensitive
grace
characteristic
of
her
genevieve
hardouin
and
jean
perliez
congratulated
her
with
hearty
pressures
of
the
hand
as
she
was
leaving
sardou
stopped
her
in
the
vestibule
tell
me
please
mademoiselle
are
you
related
to
the
professor
of
philosophy
he
is
my
father
the
girl
answered
very
proudly
delaunay
had
arisen

the
daughter
of
françois
darbois
we
are
indeed
proud
to
be
able
to
present
our
compliments
to
you

have
an
extraordinary
father
please
tell
him
that
his
daughter
has
won
every
vote
esperance
read
so
much
respect
and
sincerity
in
his
expression
that
she
curtsied
as
she
replied
my
father
will
be
very
happy
that
these
words
have
been
spoken
by
anyone
whom
he
admires
as
sincerely
as
m
delaunay
then
she
went
quickly
on
her
way
as
soon
as
they
were
back
on
the
boulevard
raspail
and
home
esperance
and
her
mother
moved
towards
the
library
marguerite
the
maid
stopped
them

not
here

he
feeling
badly

not
say
that
there
was
anything
really
the
matter
with
him
mother
and
daughter
started
someone

coming
upstairs
esperance
ran
to
the
door
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
that
parent
he
kissed
her
tenderly
his
eyes
were
damp
come

madame

gently
removed

daughter

papa

want
to
tell
you
everything
too
late
dear
child

the
two

surprised
but
how
through
my
friend
victor
perliez
the
chemist
who
is
like
me
a
father
who
feels
deeply
about
his
child
choice
of
a
career

made
a
little
move
no
little
girl
went
on
françois
darbois
i
do
not
want
to
cause
you
the
least
regret
every
now
and
then
my
innermost
thoughts
may
escape
me
but
that
will
pass
i
know
that
you
showed
unusual
simplicity
as
and
emotion
as
son
whom
i
used
to
know
when
he
was
no
higher
than
that
he
said
stretching
out
his
hand
was
enthusiastic
he
is
furthermore
a
clever
boy
who
might
have
made
something
uncommon
out
of
himself
as
a
lawyer
perhaps
but
but
father
dear
he
will
make
a
fine
lawyer
he
will
have
an
influence
in
the
theatre
that
will
be
more
direct
more
beneficial
more
than
at
the
bar
oh
but
yes
you
remember
you
mama
how
disturbed
you
were
by
dubare
plea
on
behalf
of
the
assassin
of
jeanne
verdier
well
is
it
not
noble
to
defend
the
poets
and
introduce
to
the
public
all
the
new
scientific
and
political
ideas
often
wrong
ideas
remarked
darbois
that
is
perhaps
true
but
what
of
it
have
you
not
said
a
thousand
times
that
discussion
is
the
necessary
soil
for
the
development
of
new
ideas
the
professor
of
philosophy
looked
at
his
daughter
realizing
that
every
word
he
had
spoken
in
her
hearing
all
the
seed
that
he
had
cast
to
the
wind
had
taken
root
in
her
young
mind
but
inquired
madame
darbois
where
did
you
see
m
perliez
the
professor
began
to
smile
outside
the
conservatoire
perliez
and
i
ran
into
each
other
both
impelled
by
the
same
extreme
anxiety
towards
the
scene
of
our
sacrifice
it
is
not
really
necessary
to
consult
all
the
philosophical
authorities
on
this
subject
of
inanition
of
will
he
added
wearily
oh
chocolate
custard
cried
out
esperance
with
rapture
marguerite
is
giving
us
a
treat
yes
mademoiselle
i
knew
very
well
a
ring
at
the
front
door
bell
cut
short
her
words
they
listened
silently
and
heard
the
door
open
and
someone
come
in
then
the
maid
entered
with
a
card
françois
darbois
rose
at
once
i
will
see
him
in
the
salon
he
said
he
handed
the
card
to
his
wife
and
went
to
meet
his
visitor
esperance
leaned
towards
her
mother
and
read
with
her
the
celebrated
name
victorien
sardou
together
they
questioned
the
import
of
this
visit
without
being
able
to
find
any
satisfactory
explanation
when
françois
entered
the
salon
sardou
was
standing
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
examining
through
eyes
a
delicate
pastel
signed
chaplain
a
portrait
of
madame
darbois
at
twenty
at
the
professor
entry
he
turned
round
and
exclaimed
with
the
engaging
friendliness
that
was
one
of
his
special
charms
what
a
very
pretty
thing
and
what
superb
colour
then
advancing
it
is
to
françois
darbois
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
is
it
not
he
had
not
missed
the
formality
in
the
surprise
evinced
by
the
professor
as
without
speaking
the
professor
bowed
him
towards
a
chair
let
me
say
to
begin
with
my
dear
professor
that
i
am
one
of
your
most
fervent
followers
your
last
book
is
not
is
in
my
opinion
a
work
of
real
beauty
your
doctrine
does
not
discourage
youth
and
after
reading
your
book
i
decided
to
send
my
sons
to
your
lectures
françois
darbois
thanked
the
great
author
the
ice
was
broken
they
discussed
plato
aristotle
montaigne
schaupenhauer
etc
victorien
sardou
heard
the
clock
strike
he
had
lunched
hastily
and
had
to
be
back
at
the
conservatoire
by
two
as
the
jury
still
had
to
hear
eleven
pupils
he
began
laughing
and
talking
very
fast
in
his
habitual
manner
i
must
tell
you
however
why
i
have
come
your
daughter
who
passed
her
examination
this
morning
is
very
excellent
she
has
the
making
of
a
real
artist
the
voice
the
smile
the
grace
the
distinction
the
manner
the
rhythm
this
child
of
fifteen
has
every
gift
i
am
now
arranging
a
play
for
the
vaudeville
the
principal
rôle
is
that
of
a
very
young
girl
just
at
present
there
are
only
professionals
in
the
theatre
he
rose
will
you
trust
your
daughter
to
me
i
promise
her
a
good
part
an
engagement
only
for
my
play
and
i
assure
you
of
her
success
darbois
in
his
amazement
and
in
spite
of
the
impatience
of
the
academician
withheld
his
answer
pray
permit
me
he
said
touching
the
bell
to
send
for
my
daughter
it
is
with
great
anxiety
i
admit
to
you
that
i
have
given
her
permission
to
follow
a
theatrical
career
so
now
i
must
consult
her
while
still
trying
to
advise
then
to
the
maid
ask
madame
and
mademoiselle
to
come
here
sardou
came
up
to
the
professor
and
pressed
his
hand
gratefully
you
are
consistent
with
your
principles
i
congratulate
you
that
is
very
rare
he
said
the
two
ladies
came
in
ah
he
continued
glancing
toward
the
pastel
after
he
had
greeted
madame
darbois
here
is
the
model
of
this
beautiful
portrait
the
gracious
lady
flushed
a
little
embarrassed
but
flattered
after
the
introduction
sardou
repeated
his
proposal
to
esperance
who
with
visible
excitement
looked
questioningly
at
her
father
it
seems
to
me
said
madame
darbois
timidly
that
this
is
rather
premature
do
you
feel
able
to
play
so
soon
in
a
real
theatre
before
so
many
people
i
feel
ready
for
anything
said
the
radiant
girl
quickly
in
a
clear
voice
sardou
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
if
you
think
sardou
that
i
can
play
the
character
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
try
the
chance
you
give
me
seems
to
come
from
destiny
i
must
endeavour
as
soon
as
possible
to
appease
my
dear
father
for
his
regret
for
having
given
me
my
own
way
françois
would
have
spoken
but
she
prevented
him
drawing
closer
to
him
oh
dear
papa
in
spite
of
yourself
i
see
this
depression
comes
back
to
you
i
want
to
succeed
and
so
drive
away
your
heavy
thoughts
then
said
sardou
quickly
to
relieve
them
all
of
the
emotion
they
were
feeling
it
is
quite
agreed
turning
to
madame
darbois
who
was
trembling
do
not
be
alarmed
dear
madame
we
still
have
six
or
eight
months
before
the
plan
will
be
ready
for
realization
which
i
feel
sure
will
be
satisfactory
to
all
of
us
i
see
that
you
are
ready
to
go
out
are
you
returning
to
the
conservatoire
yes
said
esperance
i
promised
to
give
cues
to
jean
perliez
the
son
of
another
learned
man
the
conservatoire
is
favoured
said
sardou
i
shall
be
pleased
to
escort
you
madame
he
added
bowing
politely
to
madame
darbois
and
this
child
shall
unfold
to
me
on
the
way
her
ideas
on
the
drama
they
must
be
well
worth
hearing
it
was
already
late
the
two
gentlemen
shook
hands
anticipating
that
henceforth
they
would
meet
as
friends
when
they
had
left
him
françois
looked
at
the
pastel
which
he
had
not
examined
for
a
long
time
the
young
girl
smiled
at
him
with
that
smile
that
had
first
charmed
him
he
saw
himself
asking
de
gossec
a
rich
merchant
for
the
hand
of
his
daughter
germaine
he
brushed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
if
to
remove
the
memory
of
the
refusal
he
had
received
on
that
occasion
then
he
smiled
at
the
new
vision
which
rose
before
his
imagination
he
saw
himself
in
the
church
of
germain
des
pres
kneeling
beside
germaine
de
gossec
trembling
with
emotion
and
happiness
a
cloud
of
sadness
passed
over
his
face
now
he
was
following
the
hearse
of
his
who
had
committed
suicide
leaving
behind
him
a
load
of
debt
the
expression
grew
proud
and
fierce
the
first
thirteen
years
of
his
marriage
had
been
devoted
to
paying
off
this
debt
then
came
the
death
of
the
sister
of
de
gossec
leaving
her
niece
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
five
hundred
thousand
of
which
had
served
to
pay
the
debt
for
the
last
four
years
the
family
had
been
living
in
this
comfortable
apartment
on
the
boulevard
raspail
very
happy
and
without
material
worries
but
how
cruel
those
first
thirteen
years
had
been
for
this
young
woman
he
gazed
at
the
pastel
for
a
long
time
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
oh
my
dear
dear
wife
in
the
carriage
on
the
way
to
the
conservatoire
the
conversation
was
very
animated
the
dramatic
author
was
listening
with
great
interest
while
the
young
girl
explained
her
theories
on
art
and
life
what
a
strange
little
being
he
thought
and
his
penetrating
glance
tried
in
vain
to
discover
what
weakness
was
most
likely
to
attack
this
little
creature
who
seemed
so
perfect
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
conservatoire
jean
perliez
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
at
sight
of
them
his
face
lighted
up
i
was
afraid
that
you
had
forgotten
me
in
the
joy
of
your
success
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
amazement
how
could
i
forget
when
i
had
given
my
word
you
know
victorien
sardou
only
said
esperance
laughing
yesterday
we
did
not
know
him
they
were
back
in
the
which
was
only
a
little
less
noisy
than
it
was
in
the
morning
many
candidates
believed
that
they
had
been
accepted
several
had
even
received
encouraging
applause
others
who
had
been
received
in
frigid
silence
comforted
themselves
with
the
reflection
that
they
had
at
least
been
allowed
to
finish
when
jean
perliez
and
esperance
entered
the
auditorium
there
was
a
flattering
stir
as
much
in
pleasure
at
seeing
the
young
girl
again
as
in
welcome
to
the
future
actor
scene
from
jean
perliez
mlle
esperance
darbois
proclaimed
the
usher
the
scene
was
so
very
well
enacted
that
a
bravo
broke
from
the
learned
group
around
the
table
which
one
of
the
judges
had
not
been
able
to
contain
his
admiration
the
young
actors
could
not
decide
each
one
believed
sincerely
the
success
was
due
to
the
other
they
congratulated
each
other
with
charming
expressions
of
delight
and
took
each
other
by
the
hand
we
shall
be
good
friends
shall
we
not
m
perliez
said
esperance
the
young
man
turned
quite
red
and
when
madame
darbois
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
kissed
it
politely
with
the
kiss
he
had
not
dared
to
give
to
esperance
chapter
iv
esperance
having
chosen
the
stage
as
her
career
the
whole
household
was
more
or
less
thrown
into
confusion
it
became
necessary
to
make
several
new
arrangements
as
françois
darbois
was
not
willing
that
his
wife
should
accompany
esperance
every
day
to
the
conservatoire
it
became
quite
a
problem
to
find
a
suitable
person
to
undertake
this
duty
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
madame
darbois
had
to
endure
humiliating
refusals
the
young
widow
of
an
officer
was
directed
by
a
friend
of
the
family
to
apply
she
seemed
a
promising
person
you
will
have
to
be
here
every
morning
by
nine
madame
darbois
said
to
her
and
you
will
be
free
every
afternoon
by
four
the
course
is
given
in
the
morning
but
twice
a
week
there
are
classes
also
in
the
afternoon
on
those
days
you
will
lunch
with
us
and
sundays
your
sundays
will
be
your
own
the
conservatoire
has
no
classes
on
sunday
so
i
understand
that
you
would
employ
me
only
to
accompany
your
daughter
to
the
conservatoire
madame
said
the
officer
widow
dryly
i
shall
be
compelled
to
refuse
your
offer
i
am
unfortunately
forced
to
work
to
support
my
two
children
but
i
owe
some
respect
to
the
name
i
bear
the
conservatoire
is
a
place
of
perdition
and
i
am
astonished
she
added
that
the
professor
who
is
so
universally
esteemed
and
respected
could
have
been
able
madame
darbois
rose
to
her
feet
she
was
very
pale
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
judge
the
actions
of
my
husband
madame
that
is
enough
when
she
was
left
alone
madame
darbois
reflected
sadly
upon
the
of
her
fellow
creatures
then
she
reproached
herself
with
her
own
inexperience
that
put
her
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
stupid
prude
she
encountered
she
was
well
aware
that
the
conservatoire
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
centre
of
culture
and
education
but
she
had
already
observed
the
modesty
and
independence
of
several
of
the
young
girls
there
the
minds
of
most
of
the
young
men
nevertheless
she
had
had
her
lesson
and
was
careful
not
to
lay
herself
open
to
any
new
affront
after
some
consideration
she
engaged
a
charming
old
lady
named
eleanore
frahender
who
had
been
companion
in
a
russian
family
and
was
now
living
in
a
convent
in
the
faubourg
where
only
trustworthy
guests
could
be
received
the
old
lady
loved
art
and
poetry
and
as
soon
as
she
had
met
esperance
was
full
of
enthusiasm
for
her
new
duties
the
young
girl
and
she
agreed
in
many
tastes
and
very
soon
they
were
great
friends
darbois
was
quite
contented
with
the
arrangement
and
could
now
attend
to
his
work
with
complete
tranquillity
every
morning
the
family
gathered
in
the
at
eight
to
take
their
coffee
together
esperance
would
recount
all
the
little
events
of
the
day
before
and
her
studies
for
the
day
to
come
whenever
she
felt
any
doubt
about
an
ambiguous
phrase
she
went
at
once
to
get
her
advice
upon
it
sometimes
genevieve
hardouin
would
drop
in
to
talk
with
her
and
mlle
frahender
esperance
adored
racine
and
refused
to
study
corneille
before
whom
genevieve
bowed
in
enthusiastic
admiration
he
is
superhuman
she
exclaimed
fervently
that
is
just
what
i
reproach
him
for
returned
esperance
racine
is
human
that
is
why
i
love
him
none
of
corneille
heroines
move
me
at
all
and
i
loathe
the
sorrows
of
and
asked
genevieve
hardouin
has
no
interest
for
me
she
never
does
as
she
wishes
how
feminine
said
the
professor
gently
oh
you
may
be
right
father
dear
but
grief
is
one
and
indivisible
her
father
cruelly
killed
by
her
lover
must
kill
her
love
for
the
lover
or
else
she
does
not
love
her
father
and
that
being
the
case
she
does
interest
me
at
all
she
is
a
horrid
girl
tenderly
she
embraced
her
father
who
could
easily
pardon
her
revolt
against
corneille
because
he
shared
her
weakness
for
racine
several
months
after
esperance
most
encouraging
admission
to
the
conservatoire
victorien
sardou
wrote
a
note
to
françois
darbois
with
whom
he
had
come
to
be
warm
friends
warning
him
that
he
was
soon
coming
to
lunch
with
them
to
read
his
new
play
to
the
family
esperance
was
wild
with
excitement
the
time
of
waiting
for
the
event
seemed
interminable
to
her
her
father
tried
in
vain
to
calm
her
with
philosophical
reflections
creature
of
feeling
and
impulse
that
she
was
nothing
could
control
her
excitement
sardou
had
also
asked
françois
darbois
to
invite
mlle
frahender
whose
generous
spirit
and
whose
tact
and
judgment
he
much
esteemed
the
old
lady
arrived
carrying
as
usual
the
little
box
with
the
lace
cap
which
she
donned
as
soon
as
her
bonnet
was
laid
aside
on
this
great
day
the
little
cap
was
embellished
by
a
mauve
satin
ribbon
contrasting
charmingly
with
the
silver
of
her
hair
all
through
lunch
esperance
was
delightful
her
quick
responses
to
sardou
questions
were
amazing
in
their
logic
the
extreme
purity
of
this
young
soul
seeking
so
courageously
struck
the
two
men
with
particular
emphasis
the
reading
was
a
great
success
the
part
intended
for
esperance
the
young
girl
part
the
heroine
of
the
piece
had
become
of
primary
importance
sardou
had
been
able
to
study
esperance
qualifications
during
the
months
he
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
home
and
he
had
made
the
most
of
his
prescience
lack
of
experience
of
the
theatre
so
natural
in
a
child
of
sixteen
suggested
several
scenes
of
pure
comedy
then
as
the
drama
developed
the
author
had
heightened
the
intensity
of
the
rôle
by
several
scenes
of
real
pathos
relying
completely
on
esperance
to
interpret
them
for
him
quite
overcome
by
the
death
of
the
heroine
she
was
to
impersonate
she
thanked
the
author
with
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
her
hands
icy
her
heart
beating
so
furiously
that
the
linen
of
her
white
blouse
rose
and
fell
it
is
rather
i
who
shall
be
thanking
you
the
day
of
the
first
production
said
sardou
much
touched
as
he
wrapped
round
his
neck
the
large
white
square
he
always
wore
i
believe
that
has
not
been
wasted
the
rehearsals
began
sardou
had
asked
for
and
obtained
from
the
conservatoire
six
months
leave
for
his
young
protégée
but
esperance
would
on
no
account
consent
to
give
up
her
classes
the
only
concession
she
would
make
was
to
give
up
the
afternoon
classes
twice
a
week
the
press
began
to
notice
this
infant
prodigy
who
wished
to
remain
quite
unheralded
until
her
debut
françois
darbois
in
spite
of
his
friendship
with
several
journalists
could
not
make
them
adhere
to
their
promises
of
silence
and
when
he
complained
bitterly
to
the
head
of
a
great
daily
but
my
friend
the
editor
rejoined
that
daughter
of
yours
is
particularly
fascinating
and
certainly
when
you
launched
her
into
this
whirlpool
you
should
have
remembered
that
the
only
exits
are
triumph
or
despair
the
philosopher
grew
pale
i
believe
went
on
his
friend
that
this
child
will
vanquish
every
obstacle
by
the
force
of
her
will
will
stifle
all
jealousies
by
the
grace
of
her
purity
and
she
already
belongs
to
the
public
while
the
fame
of
your
name
has
simply
served
for
a
you
in
your
wisdom
have
been
able
to
impart
true
wisdom
to
your
child
but
before
the
public
has
ever
seen
her
she
is
famous
and
sardou
affirms
that
the
day
after
her
appearance
she
will
be
the
idol
of
all
paris
i
owe
it
to
the
profession
of
journalism
to
write
her
up
in
my
paper
and
i
am
doing
it
you
must
admit
with
the
utmost
reserve
chapter
v
and
so
at
last
the
day
of
the
performance
came
esperance
who
was
so
easily
shaken
by
the
ordinary
events
of
life
met
any
danger
or
great
event
quite
calmly
for
this
young
girl
so
delicately
fair
so
frail
of
frame
possessed
the
soul
of
a
warrior
the
sale
of
tickets
had
opened
eight
days
in
advance
the
agents
had
realized
big
profits
the
first
night
always
creates
a
sensation
in
paris
all
the
social
celebrities
were
in
the
audience
and
what
is
less
usual
many
intellectuals
they
wished
to
testify
by
their
presence
their
friendship
for
françois
darbois
and
to
protest
against
certain
journalists
who
had
not
hesitated
to
say
in
print
that
such
a
furore
about
an
actress
poor
esperance
was
prejudicial
to
the
dignity
of
philosophy
in
a
box
was
the
minister
of
belgium
who
had
been
married
lately
and
wanted
to
show
his
young
wife
a
first
night
in
paris
the
first
secretary
of
the
legation
was
sitting
behind
the
minister
wife
look
there
that
is
count
albert
styvens
said
a
journalist
pointing
out
the
secretary
to
his
neighbour
a
young
beauty
in
a
very
gown
the
neighbour
laughed
is
he
as
reserved
and
as
serious
as
he
looks
she
inquired
so
they
say
poor
fellow
answered
the
pretty
woman
with
affected
pity
examining
him
through
her
opera
glasses
sardou
behind
the
scenes
was
coming
and
going
arranging
a
chair
changing
the
position
of
a
table
catching
his
foot
in
a
carpet
swearing
nervous
in
the
extreme
he
made
a
hundred
suggestions
to
the
manager
which
were
received
with
weariness
he
entered
into
conversation
with
the
firemen
watch
and
listen
wo
you
so
that
you
can
give
me
your
impression
after
the
first
act
for
sardou
always
preferred
the
spontaneous
expressions
of
workmen
and
common
people
to
the
compliments
of
his
own
the
distant
skurry
in
the
wings
that
always
precedes
the
raising
of
the
curtain
was
audible
on
the
stage
this
rattling
of
properties
is
very
noticeable
to
actors
new
to
the
theatre
though
it
is
quite
unsuspected
by
the
general
public
the
first
act
began
the
audience
was
sympathetic
but
impatient
however
the
author
knew
his
public
knew
when
to
spring
his
surprises
how
to
hold
the
emotion
in
reserve
until
a
climax
of
applause
at
the
final
triumph
esperance
made
her
first
entrance
laughing
and
graceful
as
her
rôle
demanded
a
murmur
of
admiration
mounted
from
the
orchestra
to
the
balcony
hers
was
such
startling
such
radiant
fairness
her
musical
fluting
voice
acted
like
as
a
strange
enchantment
on
the
astonished
audience
from
the
first
moment
the
public
was
hers
the
critic
touched
his
neighbour
elbow
look
at
count
albert
he
seems
stunned
as
the
count
leaned
forward
to
watch
more
intently
great
heavens
do
you
suppose
he
will
fall
in
love
with
her
do
you
believe
he
will
really
care
for
that
little
thing
murmured
the
woman
mockingly
the
curtain
fell
amidst
a
shower
of
bravos
esperance
had
to
return
three
times
before
the
public
which
continued
to
applaud
her
unstintedly
as
she
smiled
and
blushed
under
her
in
spite
of
fifteen
minutes
waiting
the
intermission
did
not
seem
long
the
occupants
of
the
boxes
were
busy
exchanging
calls
she
is
perfectly
adorable
she
takes
your
breath
just
think
of
it
only
sixteen
and
a
half
do
you
think
it
is
a
wig
oh
no
that
is
her
own
hair
but
what
a
revelation
of
loveliness
and
what
a
carriage
but
her
voice
above
all
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
heard
such
declamation
she
is
still
at
the
conservatoire
yes
the
ought
to
engage
her
immediately
they
would
find
it
would
at
once
increase
their
subscription
list
they
say
that
her
father
is
very
much
distressed
to
see
her
in
the
theatre
why
there
they
are
the
darbois
do
you
see
them
in
that
box
far
back
they
are
looking
very
pleased
a
tall
pale
man
passed
by
ah
there
goes
count
styvens
have
you
read
the
article
he
wrote
in
the
this
morning
no
he
puts
me
to
sleep
i
read
it
it
was
rather
unusual
what
about
about
the
fecundity
of
the
pollen
of
flowers
the
chatter
ceased
the
count
was
within
hearing
what
have
you
to
say
about
esperance
darbois
inquired
a
young
lady
the
count
blushed
vividly
an
unaccustomed
light
gleaming
in
his
clear
eyes
it
is
too
soon
to
pass
judgment
yet
he
said
losing
himself
in
the
throng
again
in
the
darbois
box
there
was
a
constant
coming
and
going
of
friends
jean
perliez
joined
them
his
face
betraying
a
conflict
of
emotions
that
were
not
lost
on
the
father
of
esperance
did
you
see
my
daughter
yes
i
just
went
to
congratulate
her
how
did
you
find
her
amazing
she
is
splendid
but
not
vain
she
seems
sure
of
herself
and
at
the
same
time
shows
a
little
stage
fright
a
special
variety
which
makes
her
hands
like
ice
and
tightens
her
throat
as
you
must
have
noticed
from
the
strain
in
her
first
speeches
indeed
i
noticed
it
and
was
a
little
frightened
said
mlle
frahender
i
know
said
jean
perliez
but
we
need
not
be
worried
it
does
not
affect
her
powers
and
the
force
of
her
decision
she
is
invincible
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
withdrew
into
a
corner
to
hide
the
emotion
which
was
choking
him
françois
darbois
had
divined
the
fervent
love
this
youth
felt
for
his
daughter
and
understood
the
sufferings
of
this
timid
love
which
dared
not
declare
itself
lest
it
be
repulsed
however
the
chemist
the
father
of
this
young
man
occupied
a
respected
position
as
a
man
with
an
unblemished
reputation
why
should
he
not
declare
himself
or
at
least
try
to
find
some
encouragement
françois
darbois
would
have
been
well
contented
with
this
marriage
esperance
was
still
too
young
but
once
engaged
they
could
wait
awhile
he
secretly
took
cognizance
of
jean
sufferings
and
a
wave
of
pity
surged
up
in
his
heart
i
will
have
to
speak
to
him
myself
he
thought
the
curtain
went
up
disclosing
esperance
a
book
in
her
hand
her
back
to
the
public
she
was
not
reading
that
was
evident
from
the
weary
droop
of
her
body
from
the
rigid
gaze
into
space
a
coming
storm
was
heralded
by
her
quick
motion
when
she
sprang
up
threw
aside
her
book
shook
the
pretty
head
to
drive
away
the
black
butterflies
in
her
brain
and
ran
to
kiss
her
stage
mother
who
was
playing
bridge
with
the
villainess
of
the
piece
there
was
such
spontaneity
in
her
movements
that
the
sympathetic
audience
cried
out
bravo
in
the
course
of
the
act
esperance
secured
several
salvos
of
applause
the
sustained
emotion
of
the
grief
that
overwhelmed
her
and
the
spasm
of
weeping
which
closed
the
act
gave
the
young
artist
complete
assurance
of
the
public
earnest
approval
sardou
had
dropped
into
the
box
of
the
minister
plenipotentiary
he
hid
himself
from
the
public
but
sought
the
opinion
of
his
great
friend
will
you
asked
the
minister
present
me
to
your
young
heroine
oh
let
me
come
with
you
besought
his
wife
the
belgian
prince
looked
questioningly
at
sardou
and
at
his
nod
of
acquiescence
they
prepared
to
go
and
salute
the
new
star
just
risen
in
the
parisian
firmament
come
with
us
my
dear
count
albert
styvens
became
livid
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
a
polite
phrase
died
in
his
throat
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
followed
the
prince
of
bernecourt
the
little
next
to
esperance
was
full
of
flowers
but
no
one
was
there
the
manager
and
author
had
agreed
that
no
stranger
should
approach
the
young
artist
only
the
family
jean
perliez
and
mlle
frahender
were
allowed
to
enter
this
good
old
soul
was
with
esperance
now
as
was
marguerite
who
was
not
willing
to
leave
her
young
mistress
sardou
knocked
let
me
know
my
dear
child
when
you
are
ready
the
door
opened
almost
immediately
and
the
young
girl
rushed
joyfully
out
into
the
little
room
she
stopped
short
upon
seeing
three
strangers
and
her
eyes
sought
sardou
full
of
startled
surprise
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
disturbing
you
little
friend
i
want
to
present
you
to
the
princess
de
bernecourt
esperance
curtsied
with
pretty
grace
the
complimented
her
graciously
he
was
a
dilettante
who
could
express
himself
most
charmingly
in
well
chosen
artistic
terms
your
excellency
overcomes
me
said
the
young
actress
i
shall
do
my
best
to
deserve
your
kindness
with
a
quick
movement
she
her
tulle
scarf
on
her
shoulders
and
blushed
a
little
the
minister
turned
and
saw
albert
styvens
standing
with
nervous
interest
gazing
like
one
bewitched
at
the
enchanting
maiden
let
me
present
to
you
count
albert
styvens
esperance
inclined
her
head
a
little
and
drew
instinctively
nearer
to
mlle
frahender
the
count
had
not
moved
the
prince
led
him
away
as
soon
as
he
had
made
his
adieux
to
the
young
girl
and
the
elder
lady
are
you
ill
or
insane
he
asked
his
secretary
insane
yes
i
think
i
must
be
going
insane
murmured
the
young
man
in
a
choking
voice
the
play
was
in
four
acts
there
were
still
two
to
come
the
audience
seemed
to
watch
in
a
delirium
of
delight
and
when
the
last
curtain
dropped
they
called
esperance
back
eight
times
and
demanded
the
author
in
spite
of
all
the
talent
displayed
by
sardou
as
author
there
was
much
enthusiasm
and
an
unconscious
gratitude
in
him
as
the
discoverer
of
a
new
sensation
no
comet
acclaimed
by
astronomers
as
capable
of
doubling
the
harvest
would
have
moved
the
populace
as
did
the
description
in
all
the
papers
of
this
new
star
in
paris
chapter
vi
the
family
found
itself
back
on
the
boulevard
raspail
the
darbois
had
not
cared
to
leave
their
box
after
every
act
mlle
frahender
carried
their
comments
and
tender
messages
to
esperance
françois
darbois
had
great
difficulty
in
constraining
himself
to
remain
in
the
noisy
vestibule
he
suffered
too
acutely
at
seeing
his
daughter
that
pure
and
delicate
child
the
focus
of
every
lorgnette
the
subject
of
every
conversation
several
phrases
he
had
overheard
from
a
group
of
men
had
brought
him
to
his
feet
in
a
frenzy
then
he
fell
back
in
his
place
like
one
stunned
nevertheless
there
had
not
been
one
offensive
word
it
was
all
praise
the
philosopher
held
his
daughter
in
his
arms
pressed
close
against
his
heart
and
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
it
is
the
first
time
and
shall
be
the
last
that
i
wish
to
see
you
on
the
stage
dear
little
daughter
it
is
too
painful
for
me
and
what
is
worst
of
all
i
fear
it
will
take
you
away
from
me
esperance
replied
trembling
pardon
me
oh
pardon
me
it
is
such
a
force
that
impels
me
i
am
sorry
you
suffer
so
oh
do
give
way
i
beg
of
you
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
her
father
sobbing
and
kissing
his
hands
sardou
who
was
expected
came
in
just
then
and
his
exuberance
was
dashed
to
the
ground
when
he
witnessed
the
trouble
the
family
were
in
come
this
is
foolishness
he
said
helping
esperance
to
her
feet
then
turning
to
the
old
mademoiselle
here
dear
lady
take
this
child
away
to
compose
herself
wash
the
tears
off
her
poor
little
face
and
hurry
back
for
i
am
dying
of
hunger
madame
darbois
remembered
that
she
was
the
hostess
and
disappeared
to
see
if
everything
was
ready
in
the
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
with
the
philosopher
the
author
exclaimed
in
the
name
of
god
man
is
this
where
philosophy
leads
you
you
are
torturing
that
child
whom
you
adore
oh
yes
you
are
distressed
i
know
the
public
has
this
evening
taken
possession
of
your
daughter
but
you
are
powerless
to
prevent
it
and
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
apply
to
yourself
your
magnetic
maxims
esperance
is
one
of
those
creatures
who
are
only
born
once
in
a
hundred
years
or
so
some
come
as
preservers
like
joan
of
arc
others
serve
as
instruments
of
vengeance
of
some
occult
power
sardou
was
an
ardent
believer
in
the
occult
your
child
is
a
force
of
nature
and
nothing
can
prevent
her
destiny
the
fact
that
you
have
seen
her
brilliant
development
in
spite
of
the
grey
environment
of
her
first
sixteen
years
should
convince
you
of
the
uselessness
of
your
protests
or
regrets
the
career
that
she
has
chosen
is
bristling
with
dangers
and
full
of
disillusions
and
gives
free
rein
to
a
pitiless
horde
of
calumniators
that
can
not
be
helped
your
task
my
friend
he
added
more
calmly
is
to
protect
your
daughter
and
above
all
to
assure
her
of
a
refuge
of
tenderness
and
love
and
understanding
esperance
came
back
followed
by
her
mother
and
the
old
mademoiselle
her
father
held
out
his
arms
to
her
and
whispered
you
were
wonderful
darling
i
am
happy
to
he
could
not
go
on
and
put
his
hot
lips
against
her
beautiful
pure
forehead
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
that
distressed
him
so
powerfully
thanks
to
sardou
gifts
as
a
the
supper
passed
off
pleasantly
enough
this
great
man
could
unfold
the
varied
pages
of
his
mind
with
disconcerting
ease
he
knew
everything
and
could
talk
and
act
with
inimitable
vivacity
his
anecdotes
were
always
instructive
drawn
from
his
manifold
sources
of
knowledge
in
art
or
science
mlle
frahender
was
stupified
by
so
much
eclecticism
the
philosopher
forgot
his
grief
madame
darbois
realized
for
the
first
time
that
there
might
exist
a
brain
worthy
of
comparison
with
her
husband
as
to
esperance
she
was
living
in
a
dream
of
what
the
future
would
unfold
one
evening
had
sufficed
for
her
to
conquer
paris
to
capture
the
provinces
and
arouse
the
foreigner
frequently
so
indifferent
to
great
artistic
achievements
the
young
pupil
pursued
her
courses
at
the
conservatoire
in
spite
of
sardou
remonstrances
that
she
would
find
it
fatiguing
the
modesty
and
simplicity
of
her
return
to
the
midst
of
her
comrades
restored
her
to
the
popularity
her
triumph
had
endangered
she
is
you
know
quite
a
pronounced
a
sharp
young
person
who
was
destined
to
take
the
parts
of
the
aggressive
modern
female
a
tall
young
man
with
a
grave
face
and
settled
manner
approaching
baldness
in
spite
of
his
years
pressed
jean
hand
affectionately
do
give
in
old
fellow
keep
up
hope
you
never
know
jean
smiled
sadly
shaking
his
head
he
looked
at
esperance
who
was
lovelier
than
ever
he
had
waited
for
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
for
the
intimacy
of
the
two
families
gave
him
a
chance
to
know
when
to
expect
his
glorious
little
friend
why
how
pale
you
are
jean
she
exclaimed
at
sight
of
him
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
murmured
what
is
the
matter
with
him
echoed
several
of
the
students
esperance
alone
was
not
aware
what
was
the
matter
with
him
poor
fellow
for
in
spite
of
the
encouragement
of
françois
darbois
jean
would
say
nothing
he
realized
the
shock
that
it
would
be
to
esperance
she
liked
him
so
much
as
a
friend
on
the
long
walks
they
took
with
genevieve
hardouin
and
mlle
frahender
she
had
very
often
frankly
confided
to
him
that
she
did
not
want
to
think
about
getting
married
for
years
and
years
i
want
to
live
for
my
art
she
would
say
and
i
will
never
marry
an
artist
he
had
then
thought
very
seriously
of
giving
up
the
theatre
and
becoming
a
barrister
as
his
father
had
always
wished
him
to
do
but
that
would
mean
that
he
would
lose
the
chance
of
seeing
esperance
so
often
jean
perliez
had
become
great
friends
with
maurice
renaud
the
cousin
they
both
talked
of
her
and
loved
her
but
maurice
love
was
more
selfish
less
deeply
rooted
he
was
not
jealous
of
perliez
he
was
sorry
for
him
and
counselled
him
to
speak
up
since
his
uncle
the
professor
was
in
sympathy
with
him
no
said
jean
she
is
really
too
young
to
understand
maurice
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
true
that
esperance
is
not
yet
seventeen
but
her
intelligence
has
always
been
ahead
of
her
years
at
twelve
she
could
outdo
me
by
the
logic
of
her
reasoning
on
the
mysteries
of
religion
we
both
adore
my
dear
jean
a
very
extraordinary
little
person
i
will
get
out
of
your
way
gracefully
if
you
succeed
but
i
have
a
presentiment
that
neither
you
nor
i
will
be
the
lucky
fellow
i
shall
console
myself
but
you
take
care
esperance
suspected
nothing
of
the
different
emotions
she
was
causing
her
youth
guarded
her
against
any
betrayal
of
the
senses
she
thought
that
love
was
the
natural
result
of
marriage
the
great
passions
as
the
poets
sang
them
exalted
her
spirit
made
her
heart
beat
faster
but
for
her
they
remained
in
the
realms
of
the
ideal
chapter
vii
a
horrible
catastrophe
occurred
in
belgium
leaving
the
inhabitants
of
the
lower
quarter
of
brussels
without
shelter
or
clothing
relief
was
organized
on
all
sides
and
the
announced
a
great
representation
of
to
be
given
as
a
benefit
for
the
sufferers
in
the
royal
theatre
de
la
monnaie
in
brussels
the
star
who
had
undertaken
fell
ill
ten
days
before
the
performance
was
due
the
comedie
was
much
embarrassed
for
the
usual
understudy
of
the
indisposed
actress
was
an
amiable
echo
with
little
talent
thought
immediately
of
esperance
and
obtained
permission
to
make
whatever
arrangements
he
could
with
her
his
arrival
at
the
darbois
home
occasioned
great
excitement
i
claim
your
indulgence
in
the
name
of
charity
monsieur
he
said
to
françois
the
finds
itself
in
the
most
awkward
quandary
we
have
prepared
a
big
gala
performance
at
la
monnaie
to
raise
money
for
all
those
poor
belgian
sufferers
oh
i
have
seen
the
notices
said
esperance
with
artistes
of
the
comedie
even
in
the
smaller
rôles
what
would
i
not
give
to
see
that
production
smiled
if
your
father
will
give
his
permission
mademoiselle
you
can
certainly
see
it
for
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
take
part
therein
what
do
you
mean
asked
darbois
curiously
our
is
sick
very
sick
and
her
understudy
is
not
equal
to
such
an
occasion
the
last
examination
you
passed
in
delighted
us
with
your
manner
of
interpreting
the
rôle
we
will
give
you
all
the
rehearsals
you
need
at
the
comedie
you
will
be
assisting
at
a
work
of
charity
and
you
will
be
recompensed
for
whatever
outlay
or
expense
that
you
may
incur
esperance
drew
herself
up
if
my
father
will
give
his
consent
for
me
to
make
my
own
reply
yes
said
the
professor
simply
then
i
will
say
thank
you
father
dear
she
said
tremulously
i
will
say
that
i
am
happier
than
i
can
possibly
tell
you
at
the
great
honour
you
have
done
me
but
that
i
do
not
want
any
recompense
started
to
speak
oh
no
i
beg
you
do
not
spoil
my
joy
then
we
will
take
care
of
your
travelling
expenses
and
those
of
your
party
she
contracted
her
beautiful
eyebrows
a
little
oh
i
am
rich
just
now
think
of
all
the
money
that
i
have
made
these
four
months
that
we
have
been
giving
victorien
sardou
play
i
do
want
anything
i
am
glad
so
glad
she
kissed
her
father
and
her
mother
impulsively
and
also
the
astonished
old
mademoiselle
what
about
me
asked
gaily
do
i
not
get
my
reward
she
held
up
her
forehead
for
a
salutation
from
the
artist
who
took
leave
of
the
family
glowing
with
delight
at
the
good
news
he
had
to
carry
back
to
the
comedie
you
will
get
a
schedule
of
rehearsals
he
called
from
the
doorway
madame
darbois
was
worried
about
the
journey
and
mlle
frahender
agreed
to
accompany
esperance
it
was
decided
that
marguerite
should
go
to
look
after
them
the
faithful
soul
had
practically
brought
up
the
child
her
zeal
and
devotion
were
unfailing
but
darbois
raised
the
objection
you
should
have
a
man
with
you
the
door
bell
rang
then
they
heard
a
voice
in
the
salon
bother
to
announce
me
i
go
up
maurice
renaud
entered
immediately
followed
by
jean
perliez
well
my
boy
said
françois
darbois
to
his
nephew
you
are
quite
a
stranger
it
must
be
a
month
since
we
saw
you
last
you
are
most
welcome
he
shook
hands
cordially
with
both
young
men
he
was
struck
by
sad
expression
and
hollow
cheeks
you
are
not
looking
like
yourself
my
friend
jean
did
not
hear
this
he
was
gazing
at
esperance
so
pretty
in
her
feather
toque
we
are
come
uncle
expressly
to
ask
your
permission
to
accompany
my
cousin
to
brussels
we
were
told
of
the
project
yesterday
by
and
if
you
approve
on
my
word
my
dear
fellow
cried
out
the
professor
delightedly
you
will
do
me
a
real
service
i
was
just
considering
about
writing
to
esperance
godfather
what
a
narrow
escape
papa
darling
and
what
a
horrid
surprise
you
were
plotting
without
giving
any
sign
then
you
prefer
this
arrangement
you
accept
maurice
and
jean
as
your
i
am
delighted
with
the
arrangement
and
i
hope
that
mlle
frahender
will
raise
no
objection
the
gentle
old
lady
smiled
at
them
all
she
was
very
fond
of
jean
perliez
and
maurice
renaud
high
spirits
delighted
her
it
was
decided
that
jean
as
most
responsible
should
be
in
charge
of
all
the
details
of
the
journey
françois
darbois
led
him
into
the
library
and
entrusted
him
with
a
goodly
sum
of
money
this
should
cover
your
expenses
i
count
upon
you
my
young
friend
and
i
thank
you
he
paused
a
moment
then
asked
affectionately
have
you
no
hope
none
replied
jean
simply
but
what
does
it
matter
but
at
least
i
am
quite
happy
two
days
after
this
visit
the
notice
of
the
first
rehearsals
was
received
esperance
was
at
the
theatre
long
before
the
hour
required
and
went
at
once
towards
the
stage
the
curtain
had
just
been
raised
and
the
lamp
of
the
servant
dusting
served
only
to
lighten
the
gloom
followed
by
mlle
frahender
the
young
girl
traversed
the
corridor
ornamented
with
marble
busts
and
pictures
of
the
famous
artists
who
had
made
the
house
of
molière
more
illustrious
by
their
talent
with
beating
heart
she
descended
the
four
steps
that
led
to
the
stage
there
she
stopped
shivering
she
seemed
to
see
shadows
drawing
near
her
and
her
hand
clenched
that
of
the
old
mademoiselle
what
is
it
esperance
nothing
nothing
was
that
not
talma
down
there
and
mlle
clairon
and
mlle
mars
and
rachel
that
magnificent
expressive
masque
there
look
came
in
esperance
still
seemed
in
a
dream
your
pardon
master
the
atmosphere
of
glory
that
one
breathes
here
has
intoxicated
me
a
little
during
the
rehearsal
the
music
of
the
voice
of
the
new
blended
charmingly
with
the
powerful
accents
of
the
great
actor
so
that
all
the
artists
listened
with
emotion
and
delight
in
the
final
act
when
beside
herself
raises
her
poignard
to
ruy
saying
i
am
of
the
family
uncle
there
was
an
outburst
of
bravos
for
esperance
who
erect
and
trembling
shoulders
thrown
back
had
just
sobbed
these
words
in
a
vibrant
voice
between
clenched
teeth
with
her
pale
face
and
arm
she
might
have
been
the
statue
of
despair
struggling
with
destiny
madame
darbois
was
heavy
hearted
to
have
her
go
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
been
parted
from
her
daughter
for
even
a
few
days
she
often
looked
at
her
husband
hoping
that
he
would
understand
her
anxiety
and
urge
her
not
to
go
too
jean
and
maurice
came
to
escort
esperance
who
had
been
ready
for
a
long
time
mlle
frahender
was
carrying
a
cardboard
box
containing
two
bonnets
and
a
light
cloth
in
which
to
wrap
her
hat
in
in
the
train
all
the
rest
of
her
belongings
were
contained
in
a
little
attaché
case
of
grey
duck
so
flat
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
contain
anything
when
madame
darbois
saw
them
drive
away
she
was
filled
with
distress
and
as
there
was
maternal
anxiety
in
the
mother
breast
so
was
there
foreboding
of
evil
in
the
father
mind
i
hope
nothing
bad
will
happen
thought
the
good
woman
but
railway
accidents
are
so
common
nowadays
who
will
she
be
seeing
while
she
is
away
what
is
destiny
providing
for
her
my
child
is
not
armed
against
adventure
the
philosopher
was
thinking
the
two
looked
at
each
other
divining
the
miserable
anxiety
to
which
the
other
was
prey
the
rough
strident
notes
of
adhemar
meydieux
voice
suddenly
broke
upon
this
atmosphere
of
gentle
melancholy
well
what
is
this
i
hear
esperance
has
gone
it
is
madness
i
read
in
my
paper
this
morning
that
she
is
going
to
play
at
brussels
so
i
have
come
to
escort
her
françois
wrung
his
hand
without
saying
a
word
what
is
the
matter
with
you
went
on
adhemar
you
seem
to
have
changed
into
pillars
of
salt
i
know
very
well
that
the
theatre
is
sodom
and
gomorrah
in
one
but
wait
a
little
before
you
give
way
entirely
who
is
going
with
my
goddaughter
mlle
frahender
marguerite
maurice
renaud
and
jean
perliez
the
poor
mother
hastened
to
say
and
what
an
escort
jeered
adhemar
the
old
mademoiselle
will
be
before
her
pupil
she
knows
nothing
of
life
provided
that
esperance
obeys
the
commandments
of
the
church
and
does
not
miss
mass
on
sunday
she
will
be
satisfied
her
piety
and
her
sudden
love
of
the
theatre
coincide
with
her
attempt
to
save
a
soul
but
i
tell
you
that
she
can
not
see
farther
than
the
end
of
her
nose
which
though
long
enough
in
all
conscience
does
furnish
elevation
for
much
view
and
he
continued
pleased
with
his
wit
maurice
renaud
that
wild
rascal
is
he
apt
to
inspire
respect
for
esperance
as
to
jean
perliez
the
poor
little
ninny
is
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
i
do
suppose
that
you
have
noticed
it
not
only
noticed
it
but
encouraged
the
young
man
said
françois
and
he
would
be
a
very
honourable
and
desirable
my
poor
friend
my
good
fellow
and
adhemar
collapsed
in
a
chair
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
my
poor
dear
friend
and
you
believe
that
esperance
he
laughed
aloud
i
will
thank
you
to
drop
that
tone
of
irony
which
is
offensive
both
to
my
wife
and
to
myself
said
the
professor
rising
if
it
pleases
you
to
follow
your
goddaughter
to
brussels
do
so
i
must
leave
you
i
have
some
proofs
to
correct
meydieux
the
old
blunderer
began
to
realize
that
he
had
overstepped
the
limits
of
decorum
but
why
did
she
go
this
morning
instead
of
by
the
train
with
all
the
other
artists
this
evening
esperance
explained
madame
darbois
left
early
in
order
to
have
time
to
see
brussels
which
everyone
says
is
a
charming
city
i
think
it
is
quite
natural
my
dear
meydieux
that
you
want
to
join
your
goddaughter
i
will
telegraph
to
her
at
once
no
no
replied
meydieux
very
hurriedly
i
would
much
rather
surprise
her
i
beg
you
not
to
warn
her
as
you
will
then
i
shall
not
interfere
part
ii
brussels
chapter
viii
meantime
seated
in
the
brussels
express
esperance
had
fixed
her
attention
on
the
constantly
changing
horizon
and
was
giving
herself
up
to
myriad
impressions
as
they
went
fleeting
by
the
great
plains
rolling
interminably
out
of
sight
pleased
her
the
light
mist
rising
from
the
earth
seemed
to
her
the
breath
of
the
shivering
tall
grasses
offering
the
sun
the
drops
of
dew
which
glinted
at
the
summit
of
their
slender
stems
she
too
on
this
beautiful
autumn
morning
felt
herself
expanding
towards
the
sky
her
fresh
lips
were
offering
themselves
to
the
kisses
of
life
she
was
at
that
moment
a
vision
of
the
radiance
of
youth
maurice
was
so
struck
by
her
beauty
that
he
drew
a
little
sketch
and
resolved
to
do
her
portrait
just
as
she
was
at
that
moment
no
love
entered
into
this
admiration
he
saw
as
a
painter
he
dreamed
as
an
artist
jean
perliez
looked
at
the
sketch
then
at
the
model
and
was
left
dazzled
and
dolorous
finally
magnetized
by
the
looks
fixed
upon
her
esperance
turned
her
head
away
with
a
little
cry
of
surprise
mlle
frahender
who
had
been
asleep
opened
her
eyes
and
straightened
the
angle
of
her
bonnet
esperance
shook
her
pretty
head
laughing
while
maurice
exhibited
his
sketch
and
announced
to
his
cousin
his
desire
to
paint
her
portrait
how
pleased
my
father
will
be
she
cried
i
thank
you
in
advance
for
the
joy
that
you
will
give
him
the
conversation
became
general
animated
merry
just
what
was
to
be
expected
at
their
happy
age
soon
after
the
train
stopped
they
had
arrived
at
brussels
jean
perliez
jumped
lightly
on
to
the
platform
mlle
frahender
adjusted
her
hat
after
having
carefully
folded
up
her
bonnet
and
maurice
helped
marguerite
to
count
the
pieces
of
luggage
just
as
esperance
was
getting
out
to
help
her
old
companion
she
had
a
feeling
of
reaction
her
face
grew
pale
with
fright
at
an
impression
she
could
not
define
two
long
arms
were
stretched
towards
her
and
she
recalled
the
hallucination
or
vision
she
had
seen
in
her
own
mirror
at
home
on
the
day
when
she
had
tried
to
interrogate
destiny
count
albert
styvens
was
standing
on
the
platform
before
her
holding
out
his
arms
his
hands
open
totally
dazed
without
understanding
herself
why
it
should
be
so
the
young
girl
closed
her
eyes
she
felt
herself
lifted
and
set
down
upon
the
ground
although
the
movement
had
been
one
of
perfect
respect
she
felt
angry
with
this
man
for
having
imposed
his
will
upon
her
when
she
looked
at
him
he
was
already
speaking
to
mlle
frahender
whom
he
recollected
having
seen
in
esperance
room
at
the
vaudeville
will
you
not
both
take
my
mother
carriage
he
asked
his
voice
slow
correct
a
little
distant
fell
on
the
ear
of
the
young
actress
but
jean
objected
quickly
i
have
engaged
the
landau
from
the
grand
hotel
very
well
we
three
can
go
in
that
said
the
count
as
he
guided
the
old
lady
and
the
young
one
towards
a
perfectly
appointed
drawn
by
two
magnificent
sorrels
esperance
who
had
been
brimful
of
joy
not
ten
minutes
before
at
finding
herself
in
brussels
now
felt
a
cloud
upon
her
spirits
the
manner
almost
the
authority
of
this
tall
young
man
of
distinction
but
of
no
beauty
of
no
magnetism
depressed
her
she
did
not
wish
to
have
him
take
it
upon
himself
to
conduct
her
small
affairs
and
she
stepped
into
the
countess
styvens
beautiful
carriage
with
the
feeling
that
she
was
leaving
her
liberty
behind
albert
styvens
got
into
the
hotel
landau
with
the
two
other
young
men
they
knew
the
count
very
slightly
and
regarded
him
with
some
curiosity
although
but
he
had
a
reputation
for
austerity
most
unusual
for
one
of
his
age
as
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
hotel
all
three
young
men
jumped
lightly
out
to
be
ready
to
help
the
girl
mlle
frahender
was
received
on
the
count
arm
at
the
same
instant
esperance
had
bounded
out
of
the
other
door
pleased
to
have
escaped
the
obligation
of
thanking
the
legation
secretary
when
she
entered
the
suite
that
had
been
reserved
she
stopped
a
moment
in
silent
astonishment
before
the
flowering
vases
and
baskets
that
filled
the
with
their
rich
colours
and
delicate
perfumes
all
that
for
her
she
threw
her
hat
quickly
on
a
chair
and
ran
from
vase
to
basket
from
basket
to
vase
the
first
card
she
drew
out
said
jean
perliez
she
looked
for
him
to
thank
him
but
he
had
slipped
away
to
hide
his
confusion
for
he
had
taken
such
pains
to
order
that
bouquet
through
the
hotel
manager
never
foreseeing
that
others
might
have
had
the
same
idea
a
pretty
basket
of
azaleas
came
from
the
director
of
the
monnaie
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
marble
table
with
protruding
golden
feet
stood
a
huge
basket
of
orchids
of
every
shade
this
orgy
of
rare
flowers
was
an
attention
from
the
count
the
girl
grew
red
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
thank
him
he
was
looking
at
her
so
strangely
that
she
stammered
and
fled
into
the
next
room
where
she
had
seen
mlle
frahender
disappear
that
man
frightens
me
she
whispered
pressing
close
to
her
old
friend
who
frightens
you
dear
child
count
styvens
that
gentlemanly
young
man
who
is
so
considerate
esperance
did
not
dare
to
speak
her
thought
that
is
not
the
way
that
others
look
at
me
she
was
ashamed
to
entertain
such
an
idea
the
knocked
discreetly
to
announce
lunch
oh
let
us
begin
at
once
so
that
we
shall
not
lose
any
time
in
seeing
brussels
they
set
out
in
great
spirits
following
wherever
the
caprice
of
esperance
led
them
already
a
famous
woman
and
what
a
child
she
is
maurice
observed
aside
to
jean
they
had
a
long
ramble
zigzagging
extravagantly
about
the
city
the
adorable
little
artist
appreciated
the
beauty
of
the
lovely
capital
and
the
church
of
saint
gudule
delighted
her
they
took
a
cab
to
go
to
the
bois
de
la
cambre
esperance
was
much
affected
by
the
horses
who
led
a
hard
life
up
and
down
the
little
streets
which
were
so
picturesque
in
their
unevenness
the
little
expedition
was
not
over
until
seven
cards
attracted
mlle
frahender
attention
they
were
from
the
minister
prince
de
bernecourt
and
the
count
albert
styvens
secretary
of
the
legation
feeling
that
she
would
not
see
the
count
gave
the
young
artist
the
sensation
of
relief
comparable
to
that
of
a
prisoner
walking
straight
out
of
his
jail
into
freedom
during
dinner
esperance
was
quite
exuberant
and
proposed
a
hand
at
as
soon
as
dessert
was
finished
after
that
we
will
go
to
bed
very
early
to
have
our
best
looks
ready
for
will
we
not
my
little
lady
she
said
placing
her
slender
hand
on
the
wrinkled
fingers
of
mlle
frahender
my
little
lady
was
the
pet
name
esperance
often
gave
her
maurice
was
only
moderately
receptive
of
the
idea
of
a
game
of
but
after
consulting
the
clock
he
was
reassured

chapter
ix
the
next
morning
marguerite
had
some
difficulty
in
waking
her
young
mistress
who
was
sleeping
soundly
esperance
enquired
as
soon
as
her
own
eyes
were
well
opened
what
kind
of
night
her
chaperone
had
passed
deliciously
restful
and
you
my
dear
child
how
did
you
sleep
i
never
woke
once
oh
what
a
sun
have
you
seen
what
a
glorious
day
it
is
it
is
the
forerunner
of
good
news
jean
cried
out
from
the
next
room
who
knows
said
esperance
the
telephone
at
her
bedside
rung
marguerite
picked
up
the
receiver
and
announced
dejectedly
meydieux
wishes
to
speak
to
mademoiselle
my
godfather
in
brussels
you
see
jean
that
i
was
right
to
doubt
your
omen
the
young
people
burst
out
laughing
really
continued
esperance
i
feel
that
he
is
going
to
spoil
my
trip
here
i
do
like
him
and
his
advice
never
coincides
with
that
of
my
father
whom
i
love
so
much
meantime
meydieux
was
getting
impatient
on
the
telephone
tell
him
that
i
am
not
up
yet
and
ask
him
to
lunch
with
us
at
then
she
explained
to
mlle
frahender
who
had
just
come
into
her
room
all
powdered
all
pinned
and
bonneted
for
the
morning
he
will
not
dare
to
bother
me
when
everybody
else
is
present
marguerite
was
still
answering
meydieux
excited
questions
what
at
nine
not
up
that
is
shameful
i
must
talk
to
her
i
will
come
to
lunch
oh
yes
but
above
all
i
must
talk
to
her
esperance
was
motioning
violently
to
marguerite
to
hang
up
the
receiver
but
mlle
frahender
objected
to
this
lack
of
courtesy
so
the
young
girl
giving
way
to
her
remonstrance
yielded
gracefully
she
even
marguerite
who
knew
her
godfather
culinary
preferences
to
order
a
lunch
that
he
would
like
then
she
dressed
in
haste
to
allow
herself
plenty
of
time
to
write
to
her
family
they
had
already
exchanged
telegrams
but
she
knew
that
her
father
would
like
to
have
a
long
letter
giving
him
the
minutes
so
to
speak
of
herself
a
tender
gratitude
swelled
up
in
her
and
her
eyes
were
wet
as
she
evoked
the
image
of
these
two
beloved
beings
reading
her
letter
commenting
upon
it
and
entering
completely
for
those
moments
into
the
life
of
their
child
as
soon
as
the
letter
was
finished
she
asked
mlle
frahender
to
go
with
her
to
post
it
so
that
she
could
herself
speed
it
on
its
way
to
them
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
get
even
if
only
for
a
as
they
turned
into
the
square
esperance
stopped
clutching
her
aged
friend
by
the
arm
look
there
she
said
there
were
two
men
side
by
side
in
deep
conversation
esperance
had
instantly
recognized
count
albert
and
her
godfather
how
did
adhemar
meydieux
happen
to
know
the
secretary
of
the
legation
they
had
just
passed
the
so
esperance
posted
her
letter
without
being
seen
by
either
of
them
and
returned
to
the
hotel
lunch
time
brought
together
all
the
guests
except
the
godfather
who
would
not
enter
until
the
exact
minute
if
he
had
to
wait
in
the
corridor
he
thought
it
witty
to
behave
so
his
hateful
stupid
mind
flattered
itself
on
being
original
therefore
as
the
began
to
strike
he
was
pompously
ushered
in
watch
in
hand
i
am
here
you
see
to
the
tick
he
said
noisily
kissing
the
forehead
his
goddaughter
pressed
forward
to
him
then
turning
to
the
waiter
you
can
serve
without
delay
he
said
i
like
my
food
hot
mlle
frahender
although
she
was
well
acquainted
with
the
abrupt
ways
of
the
godfather
frowned
at
him
with
disapprobation
nevertheless
thanks
to
maurice
who
made
a
point
of
laughing
at
everything
adhemar
said
they
had
a
gay
luncheon
and
adhemar
himself
appreciating
the
consideration
shown
for
his
palate
cast
aside
his
ill
humour
and
enjoyed
with
full
indulgence
the
present
hour
the
savoury
food
and
the
plentiful
wine
at
the
end
of
the
meal
he
examined
the
room
on
my
word
my
girl
they
have
given
you
the
royal
suite
that
must
come
pretty
expensive
darbois
said
jean
perliez
gave
me
a
very
liberal
sum
of
money
with
instructions
to
spare
nothing
for
our
little
queen
there
you
have
it
if
that
is
not
the
exaggeration
of
a
lover
little
queen
you
are
pouring
poison
in
continuous
doses
into
this
little
head
which
is
already
full
of
nonsense
esperance
will
end
by
taking
herself
seriously
she
is
already
far
too
dictatorial
for
a
child
of
seventeen
he
added
to
himself
she
must
be
corrected
i
will
do
it
myself
esperance
raised
her
eyelids
and
her
clear
blue
eyes
seemed
to
pierce
the
eyeballs
of
the
foolish
blunderer
until
he
fluttered
his
lashes
and
closed
his
eyes
to
escape
the
powerful
silent
denial
of
his
authority
very
well
he
said
succeeding
in
half
opening
his
eyes
look
at
me
as
much
as
you
like
that
does
not
keep
me
from
distrusting
you
my
child
you
are
you
have
a
pretty
voice
you
may
some
day
develop
some
talent
but
you
know
your
inexperience
is
obvious
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
know
how
you
will
pull
through
do
not
disturb
yourself
meydieux
esperance
had
a
triumph
at
the
last
rehearsal
at
the
française
mlle
frahender
nodded
agreement
i
believe
jean
continued
that
she
is
going
to
receive
a
perfect
ovation
this
evening
i
believe
it
too
added
the
old
lady
and
permit
me
to
state
my
dear
sir
that
you
judge
my
young
pupil
very
unfairly
she
is
just
as
modest
just
as
gentle
as
she
was
a
year
ago
and
those
who
love
her
may
be
well
reassured
of
that
fact
since
you
are
among
them
she
went
on
boldly
you
should
realize
it
and
rejoice
in
it
adhemar
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
are
all
mad
even
the
old
saint
they
left
the
table
he
stopped
before
a
basket
of
flowers
who
sent
you
those
my
child
count
albert
styvens
replied
jean
ah
he
does
things
well
commented
adhemar
but
he
did
not
breathe
a
word
concerning
his
conversation
with
the
count
that
morning
before
there
was
time
for
a
reply
a
waiter
entered
with
a
card
would
like
to
come
up
oh
yes
cried
out
the
young
artist
with
delight
a
little
startled
at
finding
five
people
in
the
room
regained
his
assurance
as
he
recognized
jean
and
maurice
my
dear
child
we
rehearse
at
he
said
to
esperance
so
be
prompt
because
we
have
heard
that
the
queen
will
be
there
though
you
may
not
see
her
she
is
not
well
enough
to
come
out
in
the
evening
the
young
girl
blushed
with
excitement
it
is
fortunate
that
i
shall
not
see
her
i
think
that
i
should
be
paralyzed
perhaps
she
will
send
for
you
after
the
rehearsal
returned
the
tragedian
she
is
a
patroness
of
art
and
very
kind
to
artists
will
his
majesty
king
leopold
come
this
evening
demanded
meydieux
with
great
interest
certainly
assured
him
then
as
he
was
about
to
go
he
turned
have
you
received
your
invitation
for
the
door
opened
count
albert
being
introduced
by
the
had
heard
the
last
words
i
am
just
delivering
it
myself
he
said
handing
mlle
frahender
a
card
which
she
read
to
esperance
his
excellence
the
count
de
bernecourt
minister
of
belgium
to
france
and
the
princess
hope
that
mlle
frahender
and
mlle
esperance
darbois
will
join
them
for
supper
after
the
play
at
midnight
at
their
house
but
i
can
not
accept
without
the
permission
of
my
father
said
esperance
the
raucous
and
heavy
voice
of
the
godfather
pronounced
i
will
assume
the
responsibility
your
mother
encouraged
me
to
watch
over
you
i
consider
that
this
is
an
honour
which
you
should
not
decline
especially
as
his
majesty
the
king
will
have
you
presented
replied
the
count
nevertheless
said
esperance
i
want
my
father
approval
i
will
go
down
and
telephone
to
paris
i
will
accompany
you
said
the
diplomat
quickly
she
stopped
short
and
her
expression
implied
distress
jean
went
forward
at
once
i
will
go
and
secure
the
connection
for
you
he
said
i
will
wait
for
you
downstairs
the
count
made
a
scarcely
perceptible
gesture
as
if
to
stop
him
but
he
restrained
himself
and
followed
the
girl
in
silence
out
of
the
room
he
rang
the
lift
stopped
before
them
empty
albert
styvens
went
forward
but
esperance
drew
back
and
then
she
said
quickly
i
will
go
down
by
the
stairs
and
light
as
a
breath
she
was
gone
alone
in
the
lift
the
young
count
felt
for
a
moment
abashed
but
he
speedily
recovered
himself
and
when
esperance
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
she
found
him
waiting
for
her
as
she
leaped
down
the
last
step
she
again
felt
herself
lifted
and
deposited
upon
her
feet
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
angrily
startled
and
offended
the
rapid
had
been
almost
brutal
esperance
could
still
feel
on
her
delicate
skin
the
pressure
of
the
man
strong
fingers
he
apologized
and
was
sincerely
repentant
he
had
acted
without
reflection
he
had
forgotten
his
great
strength
which
had
this
time
served
him
ill
he
was
violently
attracted
by
this
charming
little
creature
with
whom
he
admitted
to
himself
that
he
was
deeply
in
love
he
who
up
to
this
time
had
always
avoided
women
as
if
he
feared
them
the
telephonic
communication
was
lengthy
françois
darbois
gave
his
consent
to
his
daughter
to
attend
the
supper
madame
darbois
was
distracted
and
must
find
out
what
dress
esperance
would
wear
i
will
keep
on
my
costume
from
the
last
act
of
she
answered
and
after
a
gentle
farewell
esperance
hastened
to
the
theatre
for
the
rehearsal
the
director
of
the
monnaie
announced
that
her
majesty
had
come
and
that
they
could
begin
hugo
masterpiece
was
magnificently
presented
the
greatest
artists
filled
even
minor
rôles
surpassed
himself
and
esperance
drew
cries
of
admiration
from
that
select
but
critical
audience
count
albert
was
seated
in
the
orchestra
stalls
with
his
mother
the
countess
styvens
widowed
after
five
years
had
bestowed
upon
her
son
all
the
affection
she
had
cherished
for
her
husband
she
had
never
left
him
but
had
had
him
educated
under
her
own
supervision
giving
him
at
the
age
of
nine
as
tutor
a
jesuit
who
was
one
of
the
most
austere
if
also
one
of
the
most
learned
of
the
order
the
young
man
was
a
perfect
pupil
studious
ever
disdaining
the
pleasures
of
his
age
his
childhood
passed
in
the
grey
and
pious
atmosphere
in
which
his
mother
steeped
herself
his
youth
developed
under
the
rule
of
his
preceptor
a
pale
youth
without
laughter
without
aspirations
the
physicians
had
never
been
able
to
persuade
the
countess
to
let
her
son
have
the
joy
of
travel
of
sea
and
mountain
so
he
had
to
be
satisfied
with
the
physical
exercises
she
permitted
so
he
gave
himself
up
to
gymnastics
with
enthusiasm
expending
his
youthful
vigour
against
his
drill
professor
and
the
japanese
who
taught
him
the
strength
became
quite
remarkable
but
his
pale
face
disproportionately
long
arms
and
reputation
for
austerity
had
made
him
the
mark
from
the
very
first
days
of
his
diplomatic
career
for
the
gossips
ballad
makers
and
authors
of
questionable
cabaret
skits
the
day
he
heard
that
he
was
serving
as
turk
head
in
a
brussels
he
went
instantly
behind
the
scenes
of
the
theatre
and
demanded
to
see
the
director
who
was
in
conversation
with
the
author
of
the
piece
he
went
right
up
to
them
i
he
said
raising
his
hat
politely
am
count
albert
styvens
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
you
suppress
the
scene
which
i
understand
is
intended
to
caricature
me
the
manager
a
prosperous
brewer
who
had
become
proprietor
of
a
theatre
for
the
pleasure
of
producing
revues
which
if
not
witty
were
certainly
vulgar
shrugged
his
heavy
shoulders
you
expect
me
to
lose
money
that
act
is
one
of
the
best
we
have
got
and
you
sir
albert
turned
on
the
author
a
man
of
doubtful
reputation
always
on
the
alert
for
any
occasion
of
scandal
in
others
oh
of
course
i
am
sorry
to
offend
you
but
i
ca
take
off
the
piece
the
last
word
was
not
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
count
grabbed
both
of
them
by
the
napes
of
their
necks
and
knocked
their
heads
together
till
the
blood
spurted
from
their
surprised
faces
their
cries
were
heard
even
by
the
audience
reporters
came
running
to
witness
this
unbilled
spectacle
the
stage
hands
tried
to
free
the
manager
but
desisted
when
one
received
a
terrible
smash
from
the
count
fist
and
another
a
kick
that
sent
him
through
space
when
the
two
men
were
reduced
to
rags
albert
held
them
upright
and
addressed
them
i
am
going
into
the
hall
to
see
the
show
i
advise
you
to
withdraw
the
scene
we
spoke
of
and
to
which
i
object
then
he
quietly
his
clothes
and
went
into
the
auditorium
where
the
audience
were
very
noisy
and
laughing
at
the
news
the
journalists
had
reported
count
albert
was
one
of
the
best
known
figures
about
brussels
where
his
father
had
played
a
very
important
part
in
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
country
and
enjoyed
for
more
than
twenty
years
the
confidence
of
king
leopold
when
he
died
his
wife
was
still
a
young
and
very
beautiful
woman
and
his
great
fortune
had
made
the
only
heir
of
the
family
already
famous
the
count
was
astonished
at
the
clamorous
ovation
that
received
him
he
would
have
liked
to
impose
silence
on
the
people
but
he
was
a
poor
orator
and
very
timid
he
kept
silence
and
wont
to
his
seat
he
was
popular
from
that
day
and
greatly
respected
at
the
monnaie
as
soon
as
the
rehearsal
was
over
the
queen
sent
for
esperance
and
the
queen
assured
the
tragedian
of
the
admiration
that
she
had
long
felt
for
him
for
played
almost
every
year
in
brussels
but
all
her
kindly
enthusiasm
was
directed
towards
esperance
what
a
perfectly
delicious
voice
she
said
how
old
are
you
seventeen
madame
the
queen
undid
a
bracelet
from
her
arm
accept
this
modest
souvenir
of
your
first
appearance
in
our
city
mademoiselle
the
young
girl
trembled
with
emotion
after
she
had
kissed
the
royal
hand
she
tried
to
clasp
upon
her
wrist
the
jewel
she
had
just
received
the
countess
styvens
who
had
just
approached
helped
her
gently
my
mother
admired
you
very
much
said
the
count
joining
them
esperance
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
mother
of
the
young
man
she
was
dressed
in
mauve
her
temples
prematurely
grey
accentuated
the
delicacy
of
her
complexion
her
whole
person
breathed
constant
goodness
sacrifice
without
regret
the
young
artist
loved
at
sight
this
woman
she
was
beholding
for
the
first
time
and
at
the
same
time
she
had
a
presentiment
that
this
charming
and
elegant
lady
would
not
remain
a
stranger
to
her
during
her
life
the
queen
desired
count
styvens
to
accompany
the
young
girl
who
was
forced
to
take
his
arm
to
her
she
walked
quickly
in
a
hurry
to
rid
herself
of
her
strange
cavalier
who
pretended
to
be
oblivious
of
her
nervous
haste
esperance
requested
him
to
convey
to
the
countess
his
mother
her
gratitude
for
her
kindness
albert
styvens
bowed
without
speaking
and
left
her
in
a
glow
of
delight
at
the
hotel
there
was
no
topic
except
the
rehearsal
and
the
reception
the
queen
had
given
esperance
the
godfather
examined
the
bracelet
set
with
sapphires
and
diamonds
he
put
on
his
glasses
counted
the
stones
shook
his
head
and
grunted
it
is
a
superb
bracelet
do
you
realize
that
child
i
realize
that
it
is
superb
because
it
is
a
testimony
of
good
will
offered
by
this
kind
sovereign
that
is
what
makes
it
so
valuable
to
me
what
a
haughty
child
and
adhemar
began
to
laugh
the
laugh
with
which
realism
strives
to
destroy
dreams
mlle
frahender
gently
removed
the
bracelet
from
the
hands
of
the
objectionable
old
meddler
you
must
rest
and
avoid
excitement
dear
dear
child
she
said
leading
esperance
to
her
room
after
bowing
to
adhemar
maurice
and
jean
who
had
witnessed
the
godfather
want
of
tact
reasoned
with
him
in
my
opinion
meydieux
you
annoy
my
cousin
too
much
and
for
no
reason
you
forget
that
she
has
created
for
herself
a
position
beyond
her
years
and
you
treat
her
like
a
child
not
out
of
the
well
is
it
all
for
her
good
screamed
out
adhemar
in
a
fury
the
rest
of
you
burn
incense
before
her
she
will
be
destroyed
by
pride
and
that
will
be
your
fault
no
such
thing
returned
maurice
with
equal
energy
she
is
adorable
in
her
simplicity
and
has
remained
as
really
childlike
as
trusting
and
as
anyone
in
the
world
you
cast
a
gloom
on
her
spirits
you
try
to
curb
her
spontaneity
you
want
her
bourgeoisie
like
yourself
but
you
will
never
succeed
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
and
that
is
a
blessing
oh
retorted
adhemar
stung
to
the
quick
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
fine
painter
fellow
you
are
glad
enough
to
have
these
bourgeoisie
that
you
scorn
pay
for
your
pictures
if
i
make
pictures
and
anybody
buys
them
that
is
proof
enough
that
they
are
idiots
but
my
hatred
of
the
bourgeoisie
only
extends
to
the
category
to
which
you
belong
those
who
ever
since
they
were
born
have
found
their
food
ready
under
their
noses
those
who
never
using
their
ten
fingers
never
using
their
brains
live
only
to
increase
inherited
incomes
hearts
locked
by
greed
narrow
minds
unwilling
to
hear
the
just
claims
of
the
humble
of
those
who
work
and
suffer
for
them
enemies
of
progress
enemies
of
their
country
oh
oh
oh
screamed
meydieux
yes
refusing
to
perform
the
sole
function
the
state
expects
of
them
and
that
is
to
become
a
husband
a
father
a
parent
you
are
insolent
it
is
not
worth
my
while
to
reply
to
you
you
may
tell
my
goddaughter
the
door
opened
and
esperance
who
had
been
kept
awake
by
the
noise
of
their
voices
appeared
to
know
what
was
the
matter
ah
there
you
are
i
will
say
your
cavaliers
annoy
me
he
threw
a
furious
glance
towards
jean
who
had
not
spoken
a
word
it
is
a
fact
that
the
majority
of
people
cherish
more
rancour
against
the
witness
of
an
insult
than
against
the
insulter
himself
i
will
not
be
present
at
your
triumph
as
they
call
it
i
am
going
to
your
father
and
shall
tell
him
everything
my
father
godfather
knows
that
i
always
tell
the
truth
he
will
await
my
return
to
judge
my
actions
and
those
of
my
dear
comrades
adhemar
pulled
on
his
hat
and
stormed
out
of
the
room
swelling
with
wounded
dignity
esperance
blew
a
kiss
to
the
two
young
men
now
i
am
going
to
sleep
until
dinner
time
i
have
just
of
an
hour
do
not
forget
my
loyal
attendants
that
we
dine
at
she
added
with
a
sweeping
courtesy
and
disappeared
light
of
heart
at
the
departure
of
her
godfather
chapter
x
the
performance
was
an
unparalleled
triumph
for
the
players
and
little
received
the
most
flattering
part
of
the
success
the
king
knowing
that
the
queen
had
already
favoured
this
delightful
child
would
not
be
outdone
in
generosity
and
sent
to
the
of
the
new
star
a
very
beautiful
ring
set
with
a
magnificent
pearl
and
two
diamonds
esperance
who
had
never
had
any
jewellery
except
a
gold
chain
that
her
mother
aunt
had
left
her
and
the
little
ring
her
father
had
given
her
for
her
first
communion
found
herself
in
one
day
possessor
of
two
ornaments
which
the
most
fastidious
worldling
would
not
have
disdained
she
put
the
ring
immediately
on
her
first
finger
since
it
was
a
little
loose
for
the
ring
finger
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
arranging
a
lock
of
hair
with
the
ringed
hand
raising
an
eyebrow
and
laughing
delightedly
to
see
the
effect
produced
by
the
ring
count
albert
watched
her
from
the
neighbouring
room
where
he
was
waiting
his
face
was
of
a
livid
pallor
his
heart
beat
so
fast
that
he
felt
weak
and
was
forced
to
sit
down
he
was
out
of
his
senses
all
the
frenzy
of
youth
repressed
so
long
mounted
in
a
wave
to
his
brain
marguerite
coming
to
dress
her
mistress
announced
that
the
gentlemen
were
waiting
she
quickly
threw
on
a
cloak
saying
i
am
ready
and
count
albert
entered
together
the
count
offered
his
arm
to
the
old
mademoiselle
and
esperance
free
of
the
contact
that
disturbed
her
joyfully
accepted
the
tragedian
assistance
the
supper
was
charming
and
proved
to
the
young
girl
that
the
feasts
of
artists
and
men
of
the
world
do
not
end
in
the
orgies
described
by
the
odious
godfather
the
young
girl
was
at
the
right
of
the
prince
with
opposite
at
the
right
of
the
princess
none
of
the
guests
could
help
noticing
the
count
agitation
the
military
aide
representing
king
leopold
baron
von
berger
was
an
old
friend
of
the
styvens
family
he
was
uneasy
and
when
he
saw
the
young
count
preparing
to
take
the
ladies
home
no
no
my
boy
he
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
you
are
not
yourself
you
are
distraught
i
am
afraid
that
you
have
been
hard
hit
you
are
not
mistaken
replied
the
young
man
i
burn
like
a
devil
and
at
the
same
time
i
am
as
happy
as
a
god
well
now
i
am
going
to
escort
these
ladies
and
i
will
have
a
talk
with
you
esperance
slept
badly
and
woke
late
the
old
mademoiselle
was
sitting
beside
her
spectacles
across
her
nose
reading
the
papers
her
kind
face
was
beaming
she
was
cutting
out
and
putting
aside
certain
articles
then
she
pinned
them
in
order
all
ready
to
send
to
and
madame
darbois
the
young
girl
was
touched
and
raising
herself
in
bed
flung
her
arms
about
the
old
lady
what
a
dear
you
are
and
how
i
love
you
mlle
frahender
at
that
moment
had
her
reward
for
all
the
little
sacrifices
she
had
made
for
her
pupil
the
critics
were
dithyrambic
in
their
discourses
concerning
the
new
dona
sol
but
the
casual
reporters
were
as
always
indiscreet
and
disguised
the
truth
under
little
prevarications
fantastic
and
suggestive
after
having
read
two
or
three
of
the
articles
esperance
pushed
them
all
aside
she
took
the
name
of
all
the
critics
and
wrote
them
little
notes
of
thanks
while
mlle
frahender
added
the
addresses
in
the
neighbouring
room
a
discussion
was
going
on
between
her
esperance
did
not
gather
its
cause
although
certain
phrases
were
audible
no
i
tell
you
maurice
was
saying
if
it
is
worth
while
at
all
i
must
be
the
one
i
could
always
demand
a
correction
replied
jean
correction
of
what
it
is
simply
one
of
those
ambiguous
phrases
which
are
used
every
day
why
notice
it
the
sound
of
esperance
voice
cut
short
their
discussion
what
are
you
talking
about
she
called
out
nothing
at
all
returned
maurice
that
is
only
stupid
things
you
would
not
understand
that
is
not
a
very
gallant
morning
greeting
cousin
but
you
have
not
forgotten
your
promise
to
lake
me
to
the
museum
this
morning
i
hope
yes
my
dear
we
will
go
to
the
museum
in
a
very
little
while
she
heard
the
door
close
are
you
still
there
jean
she
called
and
at
your
service
he
replied
there
is
nothing
i
need
thank
you
i
just
want
to
know
what
correction
you
were
talking
about
it
is
a
private
affair
of
maurice
stammered
the
young
actor
i
see
thank
you
after
lunch
the
travellers
set
out
for
the
museum
maurice
was
surprised
and
delighted
by
the
instinct
that
guided
his
cousin
towards
the
best
that
was
in
the
pictures
he
explained
to
her
in
the
language
affected
by
painters
the
reason
for
certain
unreal
shadows
in
a
certain
picture
and
the
necessity
for
them
the
tact
a
painter
must
use
in
managing
his
light
the
difficulty
of
foreshortening
he
told
her
the
anecdote
of
delacroix
replying
to
the
professor
who
objected
that
he
had
put
a
full
face
eye
in
a
profile
but
my
dear
master
i
have
tried
everything
and
that
is
the
only
eye
that
gives
the
profile
its
proper
value
and
the
professor
of
the
great
after
several
sketches
on
the
transparent
paper
over
his
pupil
canvas
said
to
him
you
are
entirely
right
keep
that
full
face
eye
they
left
the
museum
animated
by
different
feelings
the
more
that
maurice
discovered
his
cousin
noble
qualities
the
delicacy
of
her
feelings
the
strength
of
her
loyalty
the
more
he
felt
of
protective
affection
for
this
child
who
was
so
pure
so
free
and
who
had
made
her
entry
so
bravely
into
the
whirlpool
where
things
are
generally
turbulent
and
most
brutal
in
the
brutal
side
of
parisian
life
the
admiration
of
his
twenty
years
for
esperance
alluring
beauty
was
purified
into
a
friendship
which
he
felt
growing
deeper
and
stronger
as
to
jean
perliez
he
had
become
more
and
more
resigned
that
his
love
should
remain
forever
in
the
shade
unlimited
devotion
for
all
time
all
his
being
offered
in
sacrifice
to
the
frail
idol
who
went
her
way
unsuspecting
all
the
time
that
she
was
trampling
upon
hearts
under
her
foot
chapter
xi
and
madame
darbois
had
received
the
telegram
announcing
the
return
of
their
daughter
and

at
the
station
to
meet

them
and
would
have
jumped
out
before
the
train

fully
slopped
maurice

her
just
in
time
no
foolishness
there
little
cousin
your
bodyguards

return
you
intact
to
your
family

more
moment
of
patience

a
hurry

in
to
be
rid
of
us
she
held
out
her
little
hands
to
the
two
young
men
oh
naughty
maurice
you
know
very
well
that
i
shall
never
forget
these
three
days
we
have
passed
together
when
you

been
so
good
to
me
and
taught
me
so
very
much
maurice
kissed
her
boldly
jean
put
his
lips
very
respectfully
to
the
warm
soft
little
hand
the
train
stopped
and
the
darbois

were
in
an
instant
reunited
mlle
frahender
declined
escort
to
her
convent
françois
darbois
installed
her
in
a
landau
and
after
he
had
thanked
her
heartily
for
her
kindness
to
his
daughter
gave
the
address
to
the
coachman
who
drove
away
with
the
old
lady
holding
her
inevitable
little
package
on
her
lap
and
steadying
her
little
attaché
case
on
the
seat
opposite
the
darbois
family
took
their
places
in
another
carriage
esperance
must
sit
between
her
father
and
mother
leaning
close
to
them
caressing
them
endlessly
and
dropping
her
little
blonde
head
on
her
mother
shoulder
oh
how
long
it
seems
since
i
have
seen
you
she
kept
repeating
she
held
her
father
hand
and
pressed
it
against
her
heart
it
seemed
to
her
suddenly
as
if
she
had
suffered
from
that
absence
of
three
days
and
yet
she
could
not
specify
at
what
moment
she
had
wished
herself
back
with
them
she
recounted
all
the
little
events
that
had
taken
place
during
the
three
eventful
days
you
know
she
explained
to
her
father

at
her
with
astonishment
but
the
woman
husband
came
up
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
which
he
unfolded
to
display
the
picture
of
esperance
just
beneath
the
headlines
oh
she
exclaimed
they
will
make
me
odious
to
the
public
was
so
wonderful
worms
so
fine
in
his
monologue
sadness
overcame
her
she
was
still
sad
when
she
entered
her
own
room
she
touched
all
the
familiar
little
objects
and
kissed
the
feet
of
the
ivory
virgin
upon
her
with
great
emotion
she
thanked
her
mother
with
a
look
when
she
saw
the
fresh
marguerites
in
the
two
enamel
vases
in
comparison
with
the
luxury
of
her
apartment
at
the
grand
hotel
in
brussels
the
simple
surroundings
of
her
own
room
charmed
her
anew
she
swayed
for
a
moment
in
her
sat
down
on
her
low
stool
knelt
upon
her
bed
to
straighten
the
branch
of
box
beneath
the
silver
crucifix
her
mother
had
given
her
when
she
was
seventeen
marguerite
came
in
with
the
trunk
and
luggage
what
is
that
asked
esperance
spying
a
big
box
fastened
with
nails
i
do
know
anything
about
it
mademoiselle
they
gave
it
to
me
at
the
hotel
saying
it
was
for
you
the
box
on
being
opened
displayed
a
magnificent
basket
of
orchids
attached
by
a
white
ribbon
was
a
card
countess
styvens
esperance
grew
pale
she
took
the
card
from
her
mother
hands
fearing
that
she
might
be
mistaken
it
was
indeed
the
countess
and
not
the
count
she
breathed
again
marguerite
and
the
maid
carried
the
basket
into
the
salon
then
the
young
girl
went
into
the
library
with
her
mother
the
newspaper
clippings
were
spread
out
on
the
table
and
the
two
famous
trinkets
had
been
taken
from
their
cases
madame
darbois
clasped
and
unclasped
her
hands
oh
but
they
are
too
beautiful
simply
too
beautiful
she
said
and
the
philosopher
half
in
indignation
half
in
indulgence
exclaimed
my
poor
child
you
can
not
possibly
wear
such
jewels
at
your
age
ah
said
esperance
with
disappointment
i
can
not
wear
them
why
no
it
is
out
of
the
question
you
will
be
able
to
wear
them
in
a
play
at
the
theatre
said
madame
darbois
but
her
tone
lacked
assurance
for
she
did
not
know
whether
that
would
be
possible
either
darbois
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
notices
having
pushed
aside
the
descriptive
paragraphs
he
read
them
and
gave
them
to
his
wife
your
godfather
came
to
complain
to
us
of
maurice
of
jean
perliez
and
of
yourself
you
all
displeased
him
tell
us
just
what
happened
esperance
recounted
the
happenings
with
perfect
impartiality
adding
honestly
that
she
had
done
nothing
to
try
to
persuade
her
godfather
to
remain
the
philosopher
smiled
very
well
let
us
forget
all
that
we
will
take
up
our
happy
life
again
that
has
been
interrupted
by
your
triumphs
he
added
sadly
and
then
as
the
women
were
preparing
to
leave
the
library
tell
me
esperance
who
is
the
countess
styvens
a
great
lady
at
court
and
oh
so
charming
is
count
albert
styvens
of
the
legation
any
relation
of
hers
yes
father
he
is
her
son
but
why
do
you
ask
that
your
godfather
spoke
to
me
of
this
young
man
who
it
seems
wants
to
complete
his
studies
in
philosophy
the
poor
little
star
trembled
she
was
on
the
point
of
confessing
all
her
presentiments
her
terrors
to
her
father
but
he
had
just
sat
down
to
his
desk
and
seemed
already
indifferent
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
she
went
softly
out
of
the
library
following
her
mother
who
was
bearing
away
the
newspaper
excerpts
and
the
royal
jewel
cases
in
the
beautiful
house
which
countess
styvens
occupied
with
her
son
an
animated
discussion
was
taking
place
at
the
same
moment
between
baron
von
berger
and
count
albert
i
advise
you
my
boy
the
baron
was
saying
brusquely
to
ask
for
another
post
you
so
sensible
too
sensible
for
a
man
of
your
age
in
fact
it
a
little
ridiculous
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
returned
the
younger
man
coolly
all
very
well
but
my
duty
is
to
stop
you
before
certain
danger
you
admit
that
you
adore
this
young
star
of
seventeen
the
daughter
of
a
philosopher
of
high
standing
you
do
not
intend
i
suppose
to
make
her
your
mistress
albert
styvens
felt
the
blood
run
into
his
temples
but
he
did
not
answer
the
baron
continued
more
determinedly
you
do
not
intend
to
propose
her
as
a
to
your
mother
for
an
instant
a
vertigo
froze
the
young
man
being
his
heart
stopped
beating
his
throat
contracted
with
a
terrific
pressure
of
blood
he
did
not
answer
a
word
in
god
name
cried
the
baron
violently
am
i
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
or
a
man
a
man
said
count
albert
getting
to
his
feet
a
man
whose
anger
is
held
in
check
by
his
respect
but
who
can
endure
no
more
he
added
throwing
back
his
arms
to
allow
his
chest
to
dilate
still
farther
i
am
going
to
answer
you
please
listen
without
interruption
then
after
a
moment
more
of
silence
he
declared
yes
i
am
desperately
in
love
with
this
young
girl
and
i
am
going
to
try
everything
not
to
make
her
love
me
for
that
she
probably
never
will
but
that
she
will
let
herself
be
loved
what
will
come
of
it
i
have
not
the
least
idea
i
want
her
and
no
one
else
i
will
commit
no
disloyal
act
i
give
you
my
word
for
that
if
she
should
become
my
wife
it
would
be
with
my
mother
full
permission
i
beg
you
now
my
dear
baron
to
say
nothing
further
about
it
i
am
old
enough
to
regulate
my
life
as
much
as
the
divine
guiding
force
which
you
call
permits
he
came
up
to
the
baron
clasped
his
hand
in
a
firm
grasp
and
reaching
for
his
hat
added
i
want
to
get
out
in
the
air
shall
we
go
together
the
baron
recognized
the
opposition
of
an
unchangeable
will
to
his
own
which
no
discussion
could
influence
chapter
xii
life
had
resumed
its
regular
course
in
the
apartment
on
the
boulevard
raspail
but
an
important
relationship
was
developing
in
life
count
albert
styvens
came
three
times
a
week
to
pursue
his
philosophic
studies
with
professor
darbois
this
arrangement
had
been
contrived
by
the
hypocrite
adhemar
meydieux
he
did
not
mistake
the
count
infatuation
for
his
goddaughter
a
marriage
of
such
wealth
and
aristocratic
connections
flattered
his
foolish
egoism
and
he
was
sworn
to
attempt
everything
that
would
bring
about
such
a
magnificent
consummation
a
friend
of
the
family
doctor
bertaud
noticed
alarming
symptoms
in
the
girl
most
prevalent
between
five
and
seven
each
evening
he
could
not
ascertain
the
cause
but
persuaded
the
philosopher
to
take
her
to
doctor
potain
a
celebrated
heart
specialist
madame
darbois
took
esperance
for
an
examination
françois
was
perfectly
amazed
by
the
deep
culture
of
the
count
who
at
first
sight
seemed
of
only
average
intelligence
when
the
family
gathered
together
for
dinner
he
commented
on
his
impressions
to
his
wife
and
daughter
this
young
man
is
a
very
remarkable
personality
he
said
very
difficult
to
penetrate
yet
nevertheless
very
sincere
i
do
not
believe
that
the
slightest
untruth
has
ever
crossed
his
lips
i
enjoy
working
with
him
ah
that
reminds
me
i
have
invited
him
to
dine
with
us
on
thursday
he
is
very
anxious
to
be
presented
to
you
and
esperance
already
knows
him
so
i
thought
you
would
find
it
agreeable
the
young
girl
trembled
her
blood
seemed
to
stop
in
her
veins
her
hand
pressed
against
her
heart
felt
no
movement
there
her
father
noticing
the
change
in
her
exclaimed
bertaud
is
quite
right
you
are
sometimes
abnormally
pale
do
you
feel
ill
no
father
it
is
nothing
i
felt
dizzy
for
a
moment
all
the
same
we
must
hurry
bertaud
with
his
examination
back
in
her
own
room
the
young
girl
began
to
weep
i
shall
never
escape
that
man
never
never
her
eyes
invoked
the
virgin
of
ivory
her
two
arms
extended
implored
her
but
it
seemed
to
esperance
that
they
were
opened
also
to
whatever
discouragement
destiny
might
have
in
store
she
fell
asleep
in
her
chair
worn
out
by
on
the
holy
image
a
horrible
nightmare
unfolded
in
her
brain
she
found
herself
on
a
great
map
of
the
world
with
a
voice
calling
to
her
why
are
you
frozen
there
why
do
you
move
you
are
free
as
the
air
of
this
great
globe
then
she
began
to
walk
but
at
once
she
saw
the
earth
open
and
long
tentacles
like
arms
emerge
to
clutch
her
she
recoiled
quickly
and
started
in
another
direction
but
the
same
phenomenon
occurred
again
after
that
she
determined
to
climb
on
to
a
great
plain
that
she
saw
ahead
she
thought
she
was
safe
when
all
at
once
she
saw
arising
on
every
side
the
frightful
tentacles
which
crept
along
her
viscous
and
black
nearer
near
enough
to
touch
her
an
indescribable
terror
brought
her
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
for
help
mile
frahender
and
marguerite
came
running
in
they
found
her
pale
and
bathed
in
perspiration
her
lips
were
trembling
stammering
it
was
five
minutes
before
she
recovered
herself
she
described
her
dream
and
the
old
mademoiselle
prescribed
a
little
walk
in
the
air
the
child
followed
her
chaperon
with
nervous
docility
it
was
the
day
after
the
next
when
albert
styvens
was
to
come
to
dinner
esperance
had
thought
of
saying
that
she
was
ill
but
her
heart
misgave
her
at
the
thought
of
the
anxiety
she
would
occasion
her
mother
and
then
and
then
the
dinner
would
be
postponed
and
this
man
will
have
what
he
will
have
and
i
am
the
prey
of
his
dream
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
the
dinner
was
arranged
for
the
young
count
presented
himself
at
having
been
preceded
by
two
great
bunches
of
flowers
for
madame
darbois
and
esperance
who
was
at
the
piano
when
he
came
into
the
room
the
count
entered
with
madame
darbois
whom
her
husband
had
just
presented
to
her
and
they
stopped
silent
to
listen
to
mendelssohn
beautiful
nocturne
song
of
a
summer
night
when
the
last
echoes
of
the
last
phrase
had
died
away
discreet
applause
was
wafted
to
her
she
swung
quickly
on
her
stool
and
found
herself
before
the
young
man
who
was
bowing
and
taking
the
hand
she
held
out
to
him
she
had
not
yet
overcome
that
terror
he
inspired
in
her
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
so
much
at
ease
after
dinner
they
talked
of
music
and
esperance
praising
a
magnificent
duet
of
liszt
from
the
symphony
of
orpheus
was
overcome
when
the
young
man
rose
took
her
hand
and
led
her
towards
the
piano
come
let
us
try
to
play
it
together
he
looked
towards
françois
darbois
and
received
his
nod
of
acquiescence
from
the
depths
of
the
where
the
professor
sat
clasping
his
long
fine
hands
the
count
was
intoxicated
by
the
light
perfume
of
esperance
body
there
so
near
him
that
he
seemed
almost
to
touch
her
his
strong
hands
rose
and
fell
beside
her
delicate
fingers
making
the
young
girl
think
of
a
great
hawk
fluttering
over
white
pigeons
at
the
farm
of
penhouet
in
brittany
where
for
years
she
had
spent
her
holidays
the
fragment
was
executed
brilliantly
for
these
two
persons
united
in
their
enthusiasm
for
art
although
so
different
in
personal
reactions
gave
the
two
auditors
of
this
musical
treat
a
magnificent
interpretation
of
liszt
genius
françois
darbois
and
his
wife
both
distinguished
in
their
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
could
not
sufficiently
thank
the
count
dividing
his
praises
with
congratulations
to
their
daughter
you
surpassed
yourself
my
dear
said
the
philosopher
but
then
i
admit
that
you
have
never
before
had
such
a
partner
it
was
really
remarkable
when
the
young
man
had
left
esperance
excused
herself
saying
that
she
was
tired
she
kissed
her
parents
tenderly
although
for
the
first
time
she
felt
an
unjust
and
unfounded
resentment
against
them
she
was
aggrieved
that
they
should
see
nothing
of
count
styvens
manoeuvres
the
maid
helping
her
to
undress
exclaimed
how
grand
it
was
this
evening
mademoiselle
and
what
a
fine
young
gentleman
esperance
shrugged
her
shoulders
disdainfully
marguerite
coming
in
to
see
that
the
young
mistress
whom
she
adored
wanted
nothing
could
not
help
saying
ah
mademoiselle
what
talent
he
has
that
young
count
how
well
you
two
did
look
your
backs
sitting
side
by
side
i
just
said
to
myself
esperance
shivered
guessing
what
was
coming
and
interrupted
the
good
woman
quickly
do
talk
to
me
marguerite
i
am
tired
and
i
must
go
to
sleep
but
she
did
not
sleep
chapter
xiii
the
last
presentation
of
sardou
play
was
a
veritable
ovation
for
esperance
flowers
were
presented
to
her
on
the
stage
two
baskets
attracted
special
attention
one
overflowing
with
white
orchids
the
other
with
gardenias
so
powerful
in
their
sweetness
that
even
the
first
rows
of
the
orchestra
felt
their
strength
it
was
rumoured
in
the
boxes
that
the
white
orchids
were
sent
by
the
countess
styvens
and
her
son
albert
who
were
sitting
in
a
stall
in
the
auditorium
as
to
the
gardenias
the
card
attached
to
the
green
ribbons
of
the
basket
revealed
the
name
of
the
most
elegant
clubman
of
paris
the
duke
charles
de
he
was
a
handsome
man
of
very
wealthy
adored
by
women
popular
with
men
a
ripple
ran
through
the
audience
you
know
the
duke
they
say
that
he
is
very
much
taken
they
know
each
other
no
he
has
never
been
presented
no
look
out
for
the
love
of
the
immaculate
albert
said
mockingly
a
beautiful
woman
with
bold
eyes
glancing
toward
the
stall
occupied
by
albert
and
his
mother
but
her
eyes
widened
at
seeing
the
duke
enter
to
present
his
compliments
to
the
countess
styvens
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
seen
to
go
out
with
count
albert
he
was
going
to
be
presented
to
the
young
artist
count
styvens
love
was
known
to
all
paris
as
was
also
the
respect
with
which
he
surrounded
his
idol
it
was
also
known
that
the
young
girl
did
not
return
this
love
likewise
that
the
son
of
the
chemist
perliez
was
devoting
his
life
to
esperance
but
what
would
be
the
end
of
these
two
gallants
both
so
timid
so
full
of
silent
ardour
but
now
had
entered
upon
the
scene
a
rival
possessed
of
beauty
of
confidence
one
who
had
toyed
lightly
with
women
hearts
until
he
had
wearied
of
the
facile
love
his
physical
charm
and
wit
attracted
that
should
be
good
sport
to
watch
said
an
old
beau
i
am
betting
on
the
duke
a
newly
married
bride
turned
towards
him
i
am
betting
on
the
young
girl
a
journalist
thin
blonde
very
young
just
beginning
his
career
had
followed
the
duke
and
the
count
behind
the
scenes
he
accompanied
them
into
esperance
little
room
and
described
what
happened
as
follows
she
was
holding
the
two
cards
there
in
the
midst
of
the
overpowering
odour
of
gardenias
she
blushed
when
she
heard
the
name
of
the
duke
albert
styvens
was
presenting
to
her
she
thanked
them
both
very
prettily
but
without
showing
any
preference
for
either
the
duke
began
complimentary
speeches
without
making
any
impression
when
they
took
leave
he
wanted
to
kiss
esperance
hand
but
she
withdrew
it
looking
very
much
surprised
this
rather
confused
the
duke
as
soon
as
these
gentlemen
departed
i
was
presented
and
her
manner
was
just
as
charming
jean
perliez
came
in
just
then
to
tell
her
that
the
curtain
would
go
up
in
three
minutes
he
brought
her
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
and
she
took
them
from
him
and
put
them
in
her
girdle
you
will
see
her
wearing
them
on
the
stage
perliez
is
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
he
grew
very
pale
he
went
out
without
a
word
i
think
he
must
have
gone
to
cry
out
his
emotion
in
a
corner
that
is
all
concluded
the
rising
journalist
he
repeated
his
story
twenty
times
and
by
next
morning
all
paris
knew
that
the
duke
de
had
been
received
by
esperance
like
any
other
gentleman
that
count
albert
styvens
had
been
noncommittal
and
that
jean
perliez
had
been
overcome
the
young
journalist
wrote
a
very
suggestive
article
concerning
this
little
scene
highly
ornamented
with
phrases
that
would
attract
attention
but
unfortunately
the
editor
refused
to
print
it
the
duke
did
not
care
for
notoriety
and
was
moreover
a
renowned
fencer
so
the
editor
exercised
his
discretion
count
styvens
belonged
to
the
foreign
diplomacy
and
was
very
particular
and
no
one
had
infringed
on
his
privacy
since
the
little
affair
in
the
brussels
music
hall
that
left
only
jean
perliez
who
was
merely
sincere
and
pathetic
the
public
did
not
want
to
read
that
kind
of
thing
so
much
for
the
little
journalist
countess
styvens
was
spending
a
month
in
paris
staying
at
the
legation
with
the
princess
de
bernecourt
who
always
had
a
suite
ready
for
her
there
was
to
be
a
grand
opening
ceremony
of
the
opera
season
and
for
many
years
the
styvens
had
never
missed
the
first
nights
of
the
opera
or
the
one
evening
at
dinner
the
conversation
turned
upon
music
and
a
guest
regretted
the
mechanical
performance
of
the
musical
prodigies
at
the
conservatoire
it
gives
them
a
certain
amount
of
cleverness
or
technique
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
but
there
is
no
flair
of
the
ideal
and
often
no
important
personality
i
know
a
young
artist
said
albert
styvens
who
plays
with
her
whole
soul
and
i
who
really
love
music
find
her
far
ahead
of
all
your
prodigies
almost
a
sensation
was
produced
among
the
guests
the
countess
said
with
her
sweet
smile
i
see
that
they
tease
you
here
as
well
as
at
brussels
that
does
not
affect
me
mother
you
see
i
remain
faithful
to
my
ideal
never
mind
tell
us
the
name
of
this
new
discovery
her
name
is
esperance
darbois
said
albert
rising
resting
his
two
hands
on
the
table
then
having
produced
his
effect
he
sat
down
again
what
she
is
a
good
musician
too
excellent
replied
albert
and
i
will
wager
that
whoever
hears
her
will
agree
with
me
how
is
it
possible
to
hear
her
she
does
not
play
at
the
concerts
but
tell
us
how
did
you
contrive
to
hear
her
demanded
the
princess
i
study
with
her
father
françois
darbois
so
i
have
become
a
friend
of
the
family
they
asked
me
to
dinner
once
and
i
was
early
enough
to
hear
mlle
esperance
play
after
dinner
we
played
a
very
difficult
duet
together
she
had
absolute
command
of
her
execution
and
her
emotion
a
young
attaché
murmured
to
an
amiable
dowager
i
am
afraid
that
they
have
completely
taken
him
in
count
albert
sprang
to
his
feet
i
am
not
willing
that
you
should
try
to
belittle
this
family
whom
you
do
not
know
françois
darbois
the
philosopher
is
a
fine
character
of
unparalleled
honour
and
integrity
his
wife
has
never
frequented
the
world
where
people
are
in
as
you
say
and
as
for
mlle
esperance
so
much
the
better
if
you
do
not
know
her
the
duke
de
sitting
beside
the
princess
said
to
her
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
albert
styvens
is
entirely
right
they
are
people
of
a
very
different
order
they
are
a
very
refreshing
trio
for
parisian
society
everyone
kept
quiet
and
listened
to
what
the
duke
had
to
say
it
was
well
known
that
he
was
attracted
by
esperance
beauty
and
talent
and
it
was
also
known
that
he
was
a
sceptic
a
railer
not
easy
for
anyone
to
take
in
the
attaché
not
knowing
how
to
back
out
of
his
awkward
position
apologized
for
having
spoken
in
jest
he
had
heard
but
the
world
is
so
unjust
etc
no
one
listened
for
my
part
said
the
princess
i
see
only
one
way
to
put
to
the
proof
the
statements
of
the
duke
de
and
count
albert
and
that
is
to
ask
the
darbois
family
to
dinner
afterwards
albert
must
undertake
to
persuade
this
adorable
little
comedian
to
reveal
her
ability
as
a
musician
the
minister
was
most
agreeable
and
said
all
our
guests
this
evening
must
be
present
at
the
dinner
albert
styvens
was
consumed
with
joy
and
the
duke
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
satisfaction
the
only
difficulty
was
to
find
a
suitable
excuse
for
inviting
the
darbois
chance
proved
itself
the
count
accomplice
in
conversation
with
the
professor
the
next
day
the
count
was
told
that
there
would
be
no
lesson
on
the
following
tuesday
because
the
professor
was
to
deliver
an
address
on
the
question
of
the
hour
can
philosophy
and
religion
evolve
without
danger
in
the
same
mind
the
conference
was
to
be
held
at
the
home
of
madame
lamarre
the
wife
of
a
fashionable
painter
albert
knew
that
his
mother
was
a
great
friend
of
this
lady
he
told
the
countess
and
the
princess
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
both
go
to
this
conference
when
the
professor
was
presented
it
would
be
easy
for
the
princess
to
say
that
countess
styvens
was
anxious
to
meet
again
her
little
friend
of
brussels
then
the
invitation
could
easily
follow
everything
happened
according
to
the
count
plans
françois
darbois
had
a
great
success
the
catholic
party
owed
him
recognition
for
his
noble
dissertation
on
the
rôle
of
philosophy
in
religion
he
was
a
fervent
follower
of
the
author
of
the
genius
of
christianity
the
princess
de
bernecourt
presented
sincere
compliments
to
the
affable
philosopher
the
countess
styvens
presented
herself
to
madame
darbois
who
thanked
her
for
her
special
kindness
to
esperance
who
regretted
that
she
had
not
herself
been
able
to
thank
her
sufficiently
now
wo
you
said
the
charming
princess
do
us
the
honour
to
come
to
dinner
at
the
legation
next
week
that
will
give
the
countess
and
myself
a
chance
to
renew
our
acquaintance
with
your
adorable
daughter
françois
being
appealed
to
accepted
the
invitation
for
the
following
tuesday
my
husband
will
be
delighted
dear
darbois
to
meet
you
he
is
one
of
your
most
faithful
readers
said
the
princess
on
their
return
the
darbois
found
esperance
very
anxious
to
learn
the
result
of
the
conference
françois
said
very
simply
as
he
kissed
his
daughter
you
would
have
been
satisfied
but
madame
darbois
made
loquacious
by
her
husband
success
recounted
everything
at
length
and
the
triumph
obtained
by
her
husband
in
every
detail
the
invitation
to
dine
at
the
belgian
minister
rather
dismayed
in
truth
distressed
esperance
her
joy
in
her
father
success
was
diminished
by
this
prospect
count
styvens
was
certainly
not
unaware
of
this
unexpected
invitation
you
are
quite
right
little
daughter
went
on
madame
darbois
the
mother
of
the
young
count
is
perfectly
delightful
she
is
especially
anxious
to
see
you
again
esperance
breathed
deeply
as
if
to
draw
more
strength
from
within
she
knew
her
parents
were
flattered
at
the
idea
that
the
attentions
of
the
young
count
could
only
end
in
an
offer
of
marriage
they
were
not
ignorant
that
she
did
not
love
him
but
they
hoped
that
she
would
in
time
be
touched
by
his
respectful
affection
the
philosopher
and
his
wife
had
often
talked
of
this
prospect
with
each
other
they
did
not
want
to
cause
any
pain
to
their
cherished
daughter
darbois
had
already
had
to
give
up
all
idea
of
jean
perliez
for
he
had
begged
him
not
to
speak
of
him
to
esperance
she
was
his
goddess
he
adored
her
but
felt
unworthy
of
her
with
resignation
françois
charged
his
wife
to
find
out
esperance
state
of
mind
but
these
were
futile
efforts
madame
darbois
could
never
approach
the
burning
question
she
hovered
round
it
with
such
uncertainty
that
esperance
never
for
an
instant
suspected
her
mother
real
motive
in
the
long
talks
they
had
together
chapter
xiv
a
radiant
sun
woke
esperance
on
the
following
tuesday
her
thoughts
always
on
the
future
refused
to
be
subjugated
by
the
confused
anguish
she
felt
which
almost
stifled
her
yet
this
evening
was
sure
to
be
one
of
importance
in
her
young
life
had
the
count
said
anything
to
her
mother
she
rejected
the
idea
that
he
could
think
of
her
as
capable
of
becoming
his
mistress
then
his
wife
she
would
not
give
up
the
theatre
no
nothing
in
the
world
could
make
up
for
that
far
rather
death
and
she
smiled
at
the
idea
that
she
might
perhaps
become
a
victim
of
the
great
art
she
saw
herself
struggling
against
all
hardships
and
dying
as
an
adored
victim
of
circumstances
regretted
and
wept
by
the
many
who
loved
her
her
imaginative
speculations
were
rudely
interrupted
by
marguerite
bringing
in
her
chocolate
on
the
tray
was
a
card
with
a
little
present
for
the
evening
esperance
read
the
card
and
taking
the
bouquet
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
until
tears
veiled
her
pretty
eyes
poor
fellow
she
said
i
did
not
think
of
his
side
of
it
for
the
first
time
esperance
absented
herself
from
the
conservatoire
voluntarily
she
had
so
much
to
do
she
wanted
to
look
beautiful
perfectly
beautiful
she
confided
to
mlle
frahender
i
feel
that
something
great
is
in
store
for
me
in
the
early
coming
days
she
took
particular
pains
with
her
toilette
and
looking
at
herself
in
the
tall
glass
of
her
wardrobe
reflected
i
do
not
want
to
love
count
styvens
then
i
ought
not
to
want
to
be
any
more
attractive
than
usual
am
i
a
wicked
girl
my
cousin
maurice
says
is
the
cowardly
woman
weapon
and
i
love
you
little
cousin
because
you
are
not
a
coquette
the
mirror
showed
a
lovely
girl
gowned
in
pale
blue
the
shoulders
slender
and
rounded
seemed
to
emerge
from
clear
water
made
heaven
blue
by
the
reflection
of
the
sky
the
hair
so
blonde
it
dazzled
made
a
radiant
frame
for
the
lovely
face
the
red
mouth
half
open
the
white
teeth
the
wilful
little
chin
lightly
cleft
by
an
oblong
dimple
made
this
delightful
little
maiden
one
of
the
most
dangerous
weapons
that
love
ever
fashioned
when
françois
and
his
family
were
announced
in
the
salon
of
the
princess
the
minister
hastened
forward
to
convey
madame
darbois
to
a
seat
after
presenting
her
to
the
dowager
duchess
de
mlle
jeanne
tordeine
of
the
and
several
other
guests
esperance
entrance
roused
the
curiosity
of
all
the
duke
de
after
conversing
for
a
few
minutes
to
françois
darbois
whom
he
had
met
several
weeks
before
came
up
to
the
young
girl
as
she
was
standing
before
the
countess
styvens
replying
to
the
compliments
the
charming
lady
was
paying
her
i
am
told
that
you
are
quite
a
clever
musician
esperance
looked
up
to
reproach
the
count
for
his
indiscretion
in
speaking
about
her
playing
but
her
eyes
met
the
ardent
gaze
of
the
duke
she
was
agitated
thinking
how
handsome
he
is
and
i
had
never
noticed
it
yes
indeed
mademoiselle
he
continued
in
his
easy
agreeable
manner
we
hear
that
you
have
captivated
count
styvens
with
your
playing
and
as
perhaps
you
know
he
is
recognized
as
being
quite
a
dilettante
authority
esperance
strived
to
speak
but
nervousness
prevented
her
she
sat
down
quickly
beside
the
countess
and
crept
close
to
her
a
completely
new
sensation
seemed
to
invade
her
whole
being
she
had
a
strange
feeling
of
uncertain
joy
tinged
with
pain
and
yet
she
loved
this
sensation
that
troubled
her
this
which
gave
her
a
slight
shiver
the
duke
brought
up
a
chair
and
seemed
to
be
exerting
all
his
charm
and
animation
for
the
countess
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
all
this
charm
all
this
wit
were
intended
for
the
pretty
creature
who
appeared
powerless
to
resist
his
fascinating
personality
when
dinner
was
announced
the
duke
offered
his
arm
to
the
countess
the
minister
his
to
madame
darbois
the
princess
took
the
arm
of
the
philosopher
while
esperance
naturally
accepted
the
arm
of
count
albert
she
looked
at
him
more
attentively
than
she
had
ever
done
before
and
involuntarily
made
a
comparison
between
him
and
the
duke
not
altogether
to
his
advantage
how
easy
and
graceful
the
duke
is
she
thought
how
heavy
this
man
and
dull
and
slow
the
duke
face
is
at
once
kindly
and
spirited
the
count
brooding
and
awkward
the
duke
is
a
man
the
count
but
a
shadow
at
the
same
instant
the
count
arm
pressed
her
delicate
wrist
she
had
again
to
restrain
the
repugnance
she
had
felt
before
and
her
terrible
nightmare
came
back
to
her
she
let
herself
fall
rather
than
sit
in
the
chair
to
which
albert
styvens
had
conducted
her
here
she
found
herself
between
the
count
and
the
young
baron
de
montrieux
who
attempted
with
the
most
charming
courtesy
to
forestall
her
every
want
and
monopolize
all
her
attention
the
baron
was
overflowing
with
wit
and
esperance
listened
with
delight
after
dinner
the
baron
de
montrieux
went
to
the
piano
he
was
a
very
fair
musician
and
all
the
company
were
glad
to
listen
to
him
albert
followed
him
he
was
really
gifted
and
if
fortune
had
not
otherwise
favoured
him
he
could
have
made
his
name
as
an
artist
there
was
enthusiastic
applause
the
count
bent
before
esperance
who
in
a
burst
of
artistic
appreciation
expressed
her
admiration
then
he
replied
uplifted
with
joy
to
feel
that
he
had
really
touched
her
shall
we
play
our
duet
from
orpheus
liszt
symphonic
poem
to
these
good
friends
who
are
i
think
quite
appreciative
oh
no
i
should
be
afraid
i
dare
not
you
forget
i
know
so
little
i
am
an
actress
and
i
will
recite
for
you
if
you
like
but
the
duke
came
forward
and
hearing
the
conversation
joined
in
with
a
request
that
was
almost
like
pleading
styvens
held
out
his
angular
fist
to
the
young
girl
the
duke
extended
a
long
white
hand
and
so
both
led
her
to
the
piano
the
duke
fingers
pressed
her
palm
lightly
but
with
a
suggestion
of
encouragement
while
the
count
held
her
like
a
vice
that
would
never
open
in
spite
of
her
protestations
esperance
was
installed
at
the
piano
and
esperance
resolved
to
put
all
her
best
into
her
playing
with
the
hope
of
being
able
to
transport
her
audience
into
the
highest
realms
of
the
art
that
can
express
great
aspiration
blended
with
the
pathos
of
suffering
charles
de
withdrew
to
the
rear
of
the
long
room
and
stood
alone
leaning
against
a
beautiful
italian
window
to
listen
and
to
watch
a
conflict
of
feelings
were
struggling
within
him
he
was
fighting
against
the
attraction
of
this
slender
creature
whose
white
shoulders
and
delicate
body
were
swaying
with
a
phrase
now
violent
now
subdued
her
whole
person
actuated
controlled
by
the
rhythm
of
the
music
the
heavy
frame
work
of
count
styvens
seemed
an
anchor
for
the
fragile
idol
the
duke
gnawed
his
lip
in
suppressed
emotional
anger
as
the
young
couple
left
their
seats
the
room
shook
with
applause
everybody
was
delighted
the
princess
took
esperance
by
both
hands
gazing
at
her
stroking
the
tapering
fingers
that
were
still
vibrating
with
the
fever
of
the
music
esperance
was
so
pale
that
the
princess
led
her
into
another
room
and
made
her
sit
down
praising
her
marvellous
execution
and
striving
to
quiet
the
little
heart
she
could
feel
beating
with
so
much
agitation
the
doctor
who
attends
me
esperance
explained
in
a
voice
has
told
me
madame
that
i
must
avoid
all
excitement
if
i
wish
to
live
a
long
time
but
that
i
shall
not
live
naturally
if
i
am
over
excited
or
depressed
by
emotion
they
brought
her
a
refreshing
and
soothing
drink
the
attendant
bathed
her
temples
with
eau
de
cologne
esperance
breathed
more
quietly
and
rose
thanking
the
princess
then
suddenly
collapsed
on
her
knees
sobbing
without
strength
without
consciousness
and
madame
darbois
was
summoned
to
her
side
at
once
oh
great
heaven
she
said
i
have
never
seen
her
like
this
before
usually
she
controls
herself
when
by
music
see
dear
a
little
strength
stand
up
and
we
will
go
home
at
once
but
esperance
head
slipped
from
the
mother
support
into
her
arms
while
her
whole
body
was
shaken
by
sobs
the
countess
styvens
came
in
to
find
the
girl
exhausted
by
a
storm
of
moans
and
sobs
they
succeeded
in
placing
her
on
a
large
soft
couch
and
she
fell
asleep
holding
the
countess
hand
under
the
impression
that
it
was
her
mother
in
about
an
hour
she
awoke
refreshed
unconscious
of
what
had
happened
to
her
or
where
she
was
her
father
and
mother
were
beside
her
she
got
up
and
one
of
the
maids
came
to
her
she
then
remembered
and
asked
how
long
she
had
been
asleep
you
see
mama
she
said
you
must
not
take
me
out
any
more
i
am
not
fit
for
it
then
kissing
her
mother
who
had
never
left
her
she
expressed
her
sorrow
for
what
had
happened
she
thanked
the
maid
and
asked
her
to
make
her
apologies
to
the
princess
would
you
not
like
me
to
call
her
no
please
do
not
disturb
anyone
i
could
not
bear
it
in
the
two
were
in
attendance
one
of
them
was
helping
madame
darbois
and
esperance
still
confused
slipped
her
arms
in
the
sleeves
of
her
cloak
and
then
stopped
short
her
bare
arm
had
been
touched
she
was
sure
of
it
she
turned
quickly
her
eyes
met
the
duke
enquiring
but
not
altogether
pleasant
glance
with
a
quick
gesture
the
girl
clasped
her
mantle
about
her
and
haughtily
moved
away
without
acknowledging
the
duke
bow
neither
nor
madame
darbois
had
seen
anything
of
what
had
just
passed
the
duke
de
morlay
bad
humour
vented
itself
against
count
styvens
i
have
just
passed
the
darbois
in
the
the
little
flirt
was
in
a
pitiful
state
i
helped
her
on
with
her
cloak
and
her
skin
was
like
ice
count
styvens
turned
almost
in
anger
and
his
hands
furtively
opened
and
closed
a
feeling
of
enmity
was
rising
in
his
generous
soul
he
felt
that
the
duke
had
spoken
slightingly
of
esperance
to
wound
him
twice
during
dinner
he
had
caught
the
covetous
glance
of
the
duke
fixed
on
esperance
and
he
had
suffered
acutely
in
consequence
he
looked
at
the
duke
coldly
his
shyness
would
have
made
him
dumb
had
it
not
been
for
the
sustaining
power
of
his
anger
i
can
not
reply
to
you
now
he
said
my
mother
is
here
the
duke
de
who
was
after
all
a
gentleman
came
up
to
him
albert
i
am
a
fool
i
beg
your
pardon
and
he
went
to
take
his
leave
of
the
princess
who
had
quietly
witnessed
and
understood
the
pantomime
that
had
passed
between
these
two
men
you
did
right
my
friend
she
said
to
the
duke
albert
is
a
brave
and
loyal
fellow
he
is
an
idiot
he
replied
whose
idiocy
we
must
respect
all
the
same
he
has
a
quality
which
you
and
most
of
the
other
men
of
your
age
do
not
possess
and
he
is
not
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
and
that
gives
him
enormous
moral
strength
you
find
that
a
virtue
princess
indeed
i
do
he
does
what
he
wants
without
bothering
about
what
people
will
say
but
does
he
really
know
what
they
do
say
of
him
you
know
that
albert
and
i
have
been
friends
since
childhood
said
the
princess
he
is
i
am
thirty
which
gives
me
a
little
advantage
perhaps
and
i
talk
to
him
quite
as
a
comrade
it
is
true
that
he
has
never
had
any
love
affairs
with
women
and
they
joke
him
about
it
albert
does
not
disguise
it
shall
always
be
as
i
am
he
says
i
really
love
but
he
is
in
love
now
the
princess
saw
that
the
duke
enjoyed
seeing
her
hesitation
before
answering
so
she
said
nothing
at
all
but
held
out
her
hand
which
he
kissed
respectfully
and
went
his
way
chapter
xv
esperance
had
returned
home
quite
furious
with
the
manner
of
the
duke
de
which
she
considered
insolent
she
had
passed
a
bad
night
waking
every
few
moments
she
compared
the
dignified
and
honourable
affection
of
the
count
with
the
offensive
attitude
of
the
duke
her
thoughts
flew
to
madame
styvens
as
to
a
refuge
she
was
possessed
of
great
tenderness
towards
this
charming
woman
whose
life
of
purity
and
goodness
won
the
admiration
of
all
who
knew
her
on
her
side
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
countess
loved
the
young
girl
but
although
she
did
not
cherish
the
narrow
and
false
ideas
of
many
of
her
friends
against
the
theatre
she
would
have
preferred
to
have
esperance
give
up
her
career
general
van
berger
who
always
spoke
his
mind
to
her
reprimanded
her
severely
on
this
point
it
is
impossible
he
affirmed
to
let
things
go
any
further
albert
can
not
marry
an
actress
i
realize
that
the
darbois
family
is
very
respectable
the
young
girl
seems
to
me
above
reproach
or
criticism
but
she
must
give
up
this
career
the
countess
styvens
is
not
for
the
public
eye
and
if
she
loves
him
but
she
does
not
love
him
van
berger
was
silenced
for
a
moment
what
do
you
say
she
does
not
love
him
and
you
approve
of
such
a
union
my
son
loves
her
so
deeply
and
knowing
him
as
you
do
you
can
not
doubt
the
fidelity
of
his
affection
esperance
is
touched
flattered
even
but
she
does
not
want
to
give
up
her
profession
she
would
rather
i
believe
remain
single
or
at
any
rate
only
marry
a
man
who
would
allow
her
to
continue
her
artistic
life
if
i
refuse
my
consent
to
the
question
my
son
will
no
doubt
soon
ask
me
he
will
not
insist
but
will
enter
a
chartist
monastery
he
has
a
friend
a
chartist
in
france
whom
he
visits
often
i
shall
lose
my
child
forever
and
my
sad
life
will
end
in
tears
the
gentle
woman
began
to
weep
quietly
much
touched
the
general
rose
twisting
his
moustache
courage
be
brave
the
assaults
have
not
yet
been
launched
and
you
speak
as
if
the
battle
were
lost
we
have
not
got
so
far
ahead
yet
fortunately
above
all
do
cry
that
is
worse
than
having
one
arms
and
legs
broken
i
am
yours
to
command
you
know
that
heart
and
soul
at
your
service
and
i
do
not
retreat
not
i
whatever
comes
still
dear
friend
he
said
sitting
down
beside
her
and
taking
her
hand
we
must
face
the
facts
many
of
your
dearest
friends
would
cease
to
visit
you
and
your
house
if
you
what
do
i
care
about
the
superficial
friendship
of
such
people
if
the
happiness
of
my
son
is
at
stake
thank
you
dear
friend
for
your
loyal
insistence
i
understand
it
but
i
know
that
even
if
you
do
not
succeed
in
convincing
me
you
will
not
desert
me
in
my
trouble
thank
you
the
baron
kissed
the
noble
lady
hand
the
time
of
the
trial
performance
at
the
conservatoire
was
drawing
near
esperance
had
resumed
her
usual
life
alternately
calm
and
feverish
she
was
studying
for
the
competition
she
often
wrote
to
countess
styvens
who
had
returned
to
brussels
on
the
subject
before
she
left
the
countess
had
come
to
see
the
little
invalid
who
had
touched
her
heart
so
much
that
special
evening
at
the
princess
she
had
also
got
to
know
the
professor
and
his
wife
more
intimately
the
family
attracted
her
and
she
felt
a
large
sympathy
for
them
all
of
course
she
was
fully
aware
of
the
love
her
son
had
for
esperance
and
resignedly
left
events
in
the
hands
of
god
what
did
disturb
mother
a
little
was
the
vehemence
esperance
showed
in
regard
to
her
theatrical
career
and
the
way
she
rejected
the
most
guarded
remonstrances
against
her
following
that
calling
no
no
said
esperance
to
countess
styvens
no
no
no
the
theatre
is
not
a
house
of
evil
repute
nor
are
its
followers
evil
doers
the
theatre
is
a
temple
where
the
beautiful
is
always
worshipped
it
makes
a
continuous
appeal
to
the
higher
senses
and
natural
passions
in
this
temple
vice
is
punished
and
virtue
rewarded
the
great
social
problems
are
presented
in
this
temple
instruction
is
less
abstract
and
therefore
more
profitable
for
the
crowd
the
apostles
of
this
temple
are
full
of
faith
and
courage
they
have
the
souls
of
missionaries
marching
always
toward
the
ideal
the
trials
at
the
conservatoire
were
to
take
place
on
the
fifteenth
of
july
esperance
was
ambitious
and
strove
for
the
first
prize
in
both
comedy
and
tragedy
the
year
before
the
jury
had
only
awarded
her
two
secondary
prizes
not
that
she
had
not
deserved
the
first
but
that
on
account
of
her
youth
they
had
thought
it
wiser
to
keep
her
back
for
another
year
the
young
artist
was
to
compete
for
tragedy
in
the
first
act
of
for
comedy
in
alfred
de
musset
the
dawn
of
the
fifteenth
was
clear
and
quiet
genevieve
and
jean
arrived
at
in
the
morning
to
rehearse
their
scenes
for
the
last
time
jean
had
in
his
hand
a
tiny
package
as
he
was
about
to
give
it
to
esperance
the
maid
entered
with
a
large
box
marked
lachaume
florist
which
she
gave
to
mlle
frahender
on
observing
this
jean
quickly
hid
his
package
in
his
pocket
esperance
had
opened
the
box
and
taken
out
a
posy
of
gardenias
which
she
slipped
into
her
belt
again
the
maid
entered
with
a
similar
box
containing
orchids
esperance
blushed
and
then
tore
the
bouquet
from
her
belt
so
quickly
that
she
hurt
her
finger
she
had
not
seen
that
a
card
attached
to
the
flowers
by
a
pin
read
duke
de
scornfully
she
at
once
threw
the
bouquet
aside
mlle
frahender
spoke
to
her
in
english
to
rebuke
her
for
such
conduct
whatever
its
motive
esperance
excused
herself
be
indulgent
to
me
little
lady
she
said
in
her
most
winning
way
i
am
a
little
nervous
just
now
she
put
the
white
orchids
that
count
styvens
had
just
sent
to
her
in
her
belt
jean
perliez
picked
up
the
discarded
bouquet
and
the
card
he
was
more
disturbed
by
her
anger
against
the
duke
than
by
her
passive
acceptance
of
the
young
count
gift
she
had
talked
to
him
continually
of
the
duke
criticizing
him
it
is
true
but
jean
felt
in
these
reproaches
that
esperance
was
more
or
less
practising
some
deceit
esperance
had
wished
to
have
jean
defend
the
duke
heap
on
him
praise
rather
than
the
blame
he
did
the
young
artist
felt
instinctively
that
this
man
the
duke
would
not
marry
his
little
comrade
the
three
went
back
to
work
when
the
rehearsal
was
finished
and
mme
darbois
came
in
gaily
to
take
their
breakfast
coffee
with
them
esperance
kissed
them
tenderly
and
departed
for
the
struggle
on
which
perhaps
her
career
depended
a
day
of
competition
at
the
conservatoire
offers
the
spectators
a
series
of
amusing
studies
instructive
puzzling
and
deceptive
also
at
times
ambition
jealousy
vanity
border
on
loyalty
sensibility
and
pride
most
of
these
young
people
are
preparing
themselves
to
begin
a
sharp
and
bitter
struggle
for
life
itself
others
and
these
are
very
few
are
in
search
of
if
not
fame
at
least
notoriety
they
have
elected
to
enter
upon
this
career
led
by
enthusiastic
hope
their
love
of
the
beautiful
and
unconscious
consecration
to
art
nor
will
they
cease
throughout
their
lives
to
spread
their
propaganda
in
behalf
of
all
there
is
that
is
good
when
esperance
appeared
for
the
scene
of
a
fluttering
murmur
of
approval
greeted
her
while
several
little
outbursts
of
applause
were
heard
she
was
so
pretty
in
her
gown
of
white
crepe
de
chine
her
youthfully
cut
bodice
revealed
the
slender
flexibility
of
her
neck
she
might
have
been
a
bust
in
rose
wax
modelled
by
leonardo
da
vinci
she
carried
all
before
her
by
her
interesting
interpretation
of
the
role
the
tragic
grief
of
the
daughter
of
and
was
a
revelation
for
many
there
from
one
so
young
tears
coursed
down
esperance
pretty
cheeks
the
abandon
of
her
graceful
arms
her
renouncement
of
a
struggle
against
the
gods
her
longing
for
death
her
shame
after
the
tale
of
her
radiant
vision
of
the
son
of
all
was
fully
appreciated
by
the
public
and
by
a
distinguished
company
of
connoisseurs
often
strongly
critical
but
never
insensible
to
real
talent
as
it
developed
in
the
competition
for
comedy
the
young
girl
achieved
the
same
triumph
when
the
jury
proclaimed
her
first
in
tragedy
all
being
unanimously
agreed
on
the
verdict
a
storm
of
applause
and
admiration
greeted
the
announcement
mlle
frahender
wept
with
pleasure
genevieve
hardouin
enfolding
her
little
friend
in
her
lovely
bare
arms
kissed
her
on
the
hair
esperance
felt
more
touched
by
the
affectionate
admiration
of
her
comrades
than
she
had
been
even
by
the
applause
the
day
of
the
first
presentation
of
victorien
sardou
play
at
the
vaudeville
in
the
afternoon
she
received
the
same
kind
of
ovation
for
her
competition
for
the
first
prize
in
comedy
when
she
came
out
of
the
conservatoire
they
would
have
unharnessed
her
carriage
but
mlle
frahender
and
jean
perliez
absolutely
opposed
this
manifestation
genevieve
hardouin
had
obtained
a
second
prize
in
tragedy
and
an
honourable
mention
in
comedy
jean
who
had
only
entered
the
competition
for
tragedy
had
a
first
shared
with
two
other
comrades
the
three
young
people
were
radiant
each
neglecting
his
own
fortune
to
magnify
the
triumph
of
the
others
when
esperance
returned
to
the
boulevard
raspail
she
found
her
parents
much
elated
at
her
success
count
styvens
who
had
been
present
at
the
competition
had
hurried
to
tell
them
the
good
news
and
give
them
all
the
details
of
their
daughter
significant
triumph
she
surpassed
herself
in
he
had
said
she
is
i
think
the
equal
to
some
of
the
greatest
tragedienes
and
when
they
told
esperance
she
said
is
he
still
here
looking
towards
the
salon
no
he
did
not
wish
to
weary
you
he
only
left
this
note
were
divine
in
phedre
delightfully
feminine
in
barberine
no
one
is
happier
at
your
phenomenal
success
than
your
always
devoted
albert
esperance
felt
a
world
of
gratitude
to
the
young
count
for
not
having
waited
to
see
her
she
went
into
her
room
to
undress
and
in
doing
so
drew
gently
from
her
belt
the
white
orchid
she
was
about
to
put
it
in
one
of
the
two
vases
on
the
when
her
hand
paused
of
its
own
accord
and
remained
inert
her
gaze
had
been
caught
by
the
duke
de
gardenias
in
the
other
vase
radiant
with
freshness
it
caught
the
eye
it
invited
her
to
come
and
smell
the
girl
bent
towards
its
whiteness
the
intoxicating
perfume
held
her
her
head
drooped
nearer
and
nearer
the
delicate
blossoms
her
lip
touched
the
smooth
flesh
of
the
petal
she
trembled
violently
and
threw
her
head
back
it
seemed
as
if
a
kiss
had
been
given
her
she
quivered
closing
her
eyes
longing
for
the
unpleasant
feeling
to
pass
after
a
few
moments
she
looked
at
the
poor
orchid
which
had
dropped
on
the
cold
marble
she
lifted
it
up
carefully
and
placed
it
in
some
fresh
water
then
she
sat
down
before
the
vases
where
the
two
rival
flowers
displayed
their
charms
she
was
bitterly
conscious
of
being
impelled
by
a
new
inner
force
an
almost
evil
force
and
she
looked
from
the
mantel
to
the
ivory
virgin
whose
open
hands
seemed
to
be
showering
blessings
esperance
looked
back
to
the
white
orchid
if
i
do
not
marry
that
man
i
am
lost
she
thought
almost
terrified
she
got
up
and
walked
about
to
calm
herself
to
conquer
the
instinct
which
her
reason
told
her
was
wrong
still
under
the
strain
of
the
emotions
of
the
triumphal
day
and
to
escape
the
disagreeable
thought
the
sight
of
the
radiant
gardenias
provoked
in
her
she
began
to
write
a
long
letter
to
the
countess
styvens
that
soothed
her
nervousness
a
little
she
poured
out
all
her
heart

the
spoken
and

authority
of
her
husband
to
make
what
arrangements
her
daughter
should

the
director
was
most
complimentary
to
the
young
actress
and
asked
what
rôle
she
would
care
to
choose
for
her
debut
esperance
proclaimed
her
preference
for

her
heart
was
filled
with
emotion
as
she
was
leaving
the
great

in
future
she
would
be
a
part
the
place

chapter

after
the
recent
excitement
at
the
conservatoire
following
the
competition
esperance
was
delighted
to
act
upon
the
doctor
advice
to
leave
paris
doctor
potain
had
told
the
philosopher
that
it
was
absolutely
imperative
that
his
daughter
should
have
two
or
three
months
of
absolute
quiet
he
suggested
the
mountains
but
esperance
would
have
none
of
them
she
loved
far
horizons
and
vast
plains
but
her
real
choice
was
the
sea
so
it
was
decided
that
the
family
should
go
to
their
little
farm
at
you
must
go
immediately
the
doctor
commanded
and
to
begin
with
you
must
have
two
weeks
complete
repose
in
the
sun
in
a
comfortable
reclining
chair
esperance
was
beside
herself
with
joy
to
see
the
pretty
farm
again
nestling
in
its
circle
of
tall
tamarisks
to
dream
for
hours
by
the
seaside
to
breathe
the
breath
of
furze
and
seaweed
the
windows
of
her
room
overlooked
the
land
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
she
had
wild
ocean
studded
with
black
rocks
gleaming
under
the
caresses
maurice
renaud
jean
perliez
and
genevieve
hardouin
were
invited
by
the
darbois
to
spend
their
vacation
at
the
farm
of
penhouet
their
arrival
at
the
gare
was
a
complete
surprise
to
esperance
who
threw
herself
on
her
father
neck
sobbing
with
pleasure
he
chided
her
gently
daughter
are
you
going
to
break
your
word
to
the
doctor
so
she
at
once
began
to
laugh
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
no
papa
dear
only
i
have
not
yet
begun
to
keep
it
the
cure
will
only
commence
with
my
first
day
in
the
long
chair
on
the
seashore
so
you
see
i
can
still
cry
a
little
in
gratitude
for
all
your
thoughtfulness
the
trip
was
gay
thanks
to
maurice
nonsense
modern
painter
cosmopolitan
elegant
and
cultivated
gentleman
he
could
still
become
frolicsome
and
frivolous
with
nonsense
in
happy
company
darbois
ordinarily
so
quiet
laughed
at
his
antics
till
the
tears
came
while
mme
darbois
smiled
that
pleasant
smile
that
had
first
long
ago
appealed
to
françois
heart
as
to
mlle
frahender
the
artist
wit
fairly
made
her
dizzy
as
at
brussels
she
soon
gave
up
trying
to
follow
him
for
at
the
moment
when
she
thought
she
had
caught
the
trend
of
his
humour
he
had
already
branched
off
into
another
anecdote
this
time
serious
and
her
laugh
would
come
too
late
so
she
tried
to
read
the
names
of
the
little
stations
flying
past
but
the
speed
of
the
train
was
so
great
that
like
anecdotes
she
only
got
as
far
as
the
first
syllable
she
closed
her
eyes
and
slept
they
changed
trains
at
auray
about
six
in
the
morning
the
young
people
took
charge
of
the
luggage
while
maurice
went
to
make
sure
that
the
portmanteau
with
his
canvas
and
paints
was
securely
on
the
right
train
with
his
mind
at
rest
he
joined
them
at
the
little
buffet
where
they
were
having
shrimps
pink
as
roses
fresh
eggs
coffee
and
the
little
cakes
of
the
countryside
this
way
for
quiberon
called
out
the
guard
and
the
train
carried
the
whole
family
away
to
its
next
stage
when
esperance
breathed
the
breath
of
the
sea
when
she
could
distinguish
the
green
line
of
ocean
beyond
the
trees
she
clapped
her
hands
with
ecstasy
she
became
a
guide
for
genevieve
explaining
to
her
the
conformation
of
carnac
and
recounting
with
pretty
fancy
the
legends
of
the
country
they
were
passing
through
at
last
the
train
stopped
at
quiberon
they
stopped
at
the
hotel
de
france
to
speak
to
the
proprietress
mme
le
dantec
and
get
a
picnic
dinner
from
her
to
take
with
them
the
boat
the
was
filling
the
air
with
its
second
whistle
so
they
had
to
hurry
along
the
tide
was
not
yet
full
so
they
had
to
climb
down
the
slimy
quay
slippery
with
trodden
seaweed
shiny
with
fish
scales
the
boat
was
taking
on
board
a
dozen
red
hogs
that
snorted
mightily
several
women
with
baskets
settled
themselves
in
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
using
the
baskets
as
a
barricade
between
themselves
and
the
pigs
our
travellers
settled
themselves
as
well
as
possible
which
was
not
well
at
all
on
the
little
bridge
under
an
awning
however
esperance
found
it
all
delightful
the
trip
was
rather
rough
and
uncomfortable
but
most
of
the
company
made
the
best
of
it
mlle
frahender
grew
pale
and
ill
and
her
hair
flew
about
in
the
most
comic
disarray
cosily
ensconced
in
a
corner
maurice
sketched
the
various
attitudes
his
companions
assumed
with
every
antic
of
the
soulacroup
hunched
up
on
the
seat
esperance
clung
to
the
rigging
genevieve
clutched
at
her
when
a
wave
pitched
the
boat
too
far
over
the
others
well
muffled
up
waited
in
silence
jean
perliez
sighted
the
shore
continually
with
his
glasses
wishing
it
ever
nearer
so
that
his
impatient
idol
might
soon
be
safe
on
shore
again
in
due
course
the
port
of
palais
came
in
view
the
whistle
shrieked
through
the
air
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
they
landed
first
the
red
pigs
were
taken
off
tottering
even
on
solid
land
no
doubt
brooding
over
the
evils
they
had
just
passed
through
maurice
was
enthusiastic
when
he
caught
a
good
view
of
the
little
port
of
palais
filled
with
a
hundred
little
boats
lined
with
blue
nets
the
tuna
boats
carried
from
their
ropes
and
around
their
sides
long
stiff
silver
tunas
so
bright
in
the
sun
rays
that
they
hurt
the
eyes
oh
do
look
cried
esperance
a
little
boat
had
just
approached
overladen
with
sardines
and
soon
a
silver
shower
was
falling
on
the
hard
stones
of
the
quay
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
and
the
excitement
of
the
parisians
amused
the
jolly
fishermen
mightily
françois
darbois
led
his
party
to
the
carriage
that
was
waiting
a
brake
with
six
seats
drawn
by
two
farm
horses
the
farmer
on
the
box
seat
was
beaming
with
pride
at
the
return
of
his
patrons
it
is
more
than
an
hour
journey
from
palais
to
penhouet
but
the
road
seemed
short
on
account
of
its
variety
of
view
leaving
palais
there
was
first
of
all
the
ropemakers
rolling
long
strands
of
hemp
with
their
fingers
almost
bleeding
over
the
task
they
had
chosen
a
charming
spot
shaded
by
a
little
orchard
they
worked
and
sang
the
ropemaker
song
with
a
lingering
dragging
melody
and
then
after
passing
a
little
wood
the
island
itself
came
into
view
it
was
covered
with
gorse
like
a
series
of
oriental
carpets
dotted
with
the
gold
of
the
broom
in
bloom
woven
with
rose
heather
and
red
heather
and
purple
heather
the
bright
green
foliage
of
the
wild
roses
appeared
like
arabesques
the
sky
hanging
low
bluish
green
without
a
cloud
seemed
as
a
silken
film
stretched
to
filter
the
heat
of
the
sun
at
a
turn
in
the
road
the
plain
disappeared
to
give
place
to
little
hills
which
rise
from
every
side
to
defend
from
wind
and
rain
the
beautiful
golden
wheat
with
its
heads
drooping
under
the
weight
of
the
heavy
grain
ah
cried
esperance
joyfully
standing
up
in
the
carriage
i
can
see
there
is
the
farm
just
ahead
the
road
dropped
abruptly
so
they
had
to
put
on
the
brakes
in
spite
of
esperance
impatience
and
the
two
young
girls
clinging
to
each
other
saw
the
little
farm
house
enlarge
as
they
grew
nearer
at
last
the
carriage
stopped
and
the
farmer
wife
came
forward
to
meet
them
with
her
three
children
at
she
looked
forty
like
most
peasant
women
exhausted
by
work
and
madame
darbois
caressed
the
children
who
had
just
been
having
their
ears
washed
and
their
hair
combed
vigorously
to
prepare
them
for
the
advent
of
their
master
family
the
farm
house
was
long
and
close
to
the
earth
being
only
one
story
high
the
front
door
gave
directly
on
the
same
level
into
the
a
large
room
which
also
served
as
the
salon
or
parlour
with
a
bright
kitchen
to
one
side
where
shining
casseroles
spoke
of
the
order
of
the
proprietors
to
the
left
was
a
large
bedroom
sacred
to
the
darbois
themselves
close
to
the
kitchen
was
a
very
comfortable
room
for
marguerite
and
the
other
maid
a
wooden
staircase
led
to
six
rooms
above
which
were
very
airy
and
all
hung
with
bright
chintzes
mlle
frahender
was
installed
next
to
esperance
with
genevieve
on
the
other
side
the
two
young
men
were
sent
to
what
was
known
as
the
five
divisions
of
the
world
being
composed
of
five
cabins
europe
asia
africa
america
and
oceania
these
five
rooms
were
always
reserved
for
guests
were
built
of
pitchpine
and
their
windows
gave
directly
on
the
sea
farther
away
at
the
edge
of
the
fields
were
the
farmer
quarters
with
a
long
pond
full
of
reeds
and
iris
hard
by
and
adjoining
the
pond
a
pigeon
house
with
sixteen
white
pigeons
which
were
very
dear
to
esperance
she
loved
to
see
them
fly
across
the
water
like
pretty
messengers
disporting
between
two
skies
after
a
frugal
dinner
the
young
people
climbed
the
dills
as
far
as
penhouet
the
bay
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
high
rocks
behind
which
were
hidden
smaller
rocks
covered
with
mosses
and
mussels
and
on
the
right
the
cliff
hollowed
out
into
a
dark
cave
facing
the
land
this
little
beach
cheerful
by
day
grew
mysterious
with
the
fall
of
night
esperance
could
point
out
quiberon
outlined
across
the
way
between
land
and
sky
like
a
ribbon
of
light
the
little
lighthouse
high
on
the
plateau
above
the
farm
sent
out
its
long
lunar
arms
regularly
to
sweep
the
country
and
search
the
sea
chapter
xvii
esperance
kept
her
word
to
doctor
potain
and
spent
fifteen
days
stretched
out
in
a
cosy
lounge
chair
the
particular
part
of
the
beach
had
been
chosen
by
maurice
for
it
was
during
this
time
of
forced
repose
that
he
intended
to
do
his
cousin
portrait
for
the
next
salon
in
a
little
hollow
of
the
hill
he
settled
the
chair
a
great
tamarisk
with
feathery
foliage
of
bright
green
formed
a
background
to
the
right
was
the
sea
to
the
left
a
glowering
mass
of
dark
rocks
jean
and
genevieve
took
turns
in
reading
aloud
and
the
picture
was
said
to
be
progressing
famously
during
the
first
two
weeks
esperance
spent
about
five
hours
every
day
in
the
chair
but
from
the
sixteenth
day
she
only
devoted
one
hour
for
posing
after
lunch
and
then
she
began
to
organize
excursions
to
explore
the
country
round
about
one
morning
as
the
four
young
people
were
returning
from
a
bicycle
ride
they
saw
ahead
of
them
the
little
brake
on
its
return
journey
from
palais
to
the
farm
which
mme
darbois
had
used
on
a
shopping
expedition
with
marguerite
in
the
brake
were
two
other
persons
two
men
the
excursionists
were
still
too
far
from
the
carriage
to
recognize
the
strangers
but
esperance
who
was
watching
stopped
suddenly
genevieve
who
was
behind
her
almost
rode
into
her
and
had
to
jump
lightly
from
her
wheel
maurice
and
jean
were
some
distance
behind
she
called
to
them
they
were
much
concerned
to
find
esperance
with
a
pale
face
clenching
her
hands
on
the
what
is
it
cousin
what
ails
you
at
first
she
did
not
speak
at
all
then
her
eyes
lost
their
look
and
she
gazed
at
jean
i
do
know
she
said
in
a
changed
voice
i
think
i
had
some
hallucination
come
upon
me
then
she
pointed
towards
the
distant
brake
which
was
approaching
penhouet
at
a
great
pace
what
did
you
see
maurice
insisted
you
have
had
a
dizzy
feeling
come
over
you
you
must
be
careful
yes
perhaps
so
she
went
on
shaking
her
head
as
if
to
rid
it
of
some
vague
thoughts
that
were
disturbing
her
brain
perhaps
so
but
let
us
be
quick
for
one
of
the
gentlemen
was
doctor
potain
were
there
two
men
asked
jean
yes
two
and
she
started
off
again
at
a
great
pace
jean
was
dolefully
perplexed
when
they
arrived
at
the
farm
they
were
quite
breathless
from
their
long
ride
the
philosopher
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
esperance
my
dear
he
said
doctor
potain
is
here
with
the
duke
de
your
mother
met
them
at
the
palais
just
as
they
had
landed
from
the
boat
and
were
looking
for
a
carriage
very
well
father
i
must
change
my
things
and
i
will
be
with
you
as
quickly
as
possible
jean
perliez
understood
the
emotion
of
his
dear
little
comrade
she
seemed
to
him
at
once
terrified
and
fascinated
maurice
was
presented
to
the
duke
who
immediately
began
to
make
himself
agreeable
he
was
quite
anxious
he
said
to
see
the
portrait
of
which
darbois
had
spoken
so
maurice
led
him
up
the
hill
side
the
portrait
was
on
an
easel
and
from
a
distance
the
duke
almost
thought
that
he
was
seeing
the
real
esperance
the
little
girl
who
was
troubling
his
life
he
was
delighted
with
the
freshness
of
the
colouring
and
the
perfection
of
the
likeness
so
necessary
when
the
model
is
so
beautiful
maurice
was
pleased
by
the
appreciation
of
such
a
skilled
dilettante
the
praise
was
evidently
sincere
he
was
very
much
taken
with
the
duke
who
predicted
a
glorious
future
for
him
jean
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
girl
rooms
and
watched
them
descend
esperance
was
looking
radiant
she
had
dressed
herself
with
particular
care
he
understood
the
tremors
of
her
heart
and
decided
to
keep
watch
in
case
she
should
need
him
when
the
girls
came
into
the
hall
the
duke
was
talking
to
maurice
and
the
doctor
to
françois
darbois
the
gentlemen
had
not
heard
the
door
open
but
intuitively
the
duke
turned
around
esperance
met
his
burning
eyes
which
were
veiled
by
an
expression
that
suggested
repentant
submission
she
inclined
her
head
slowly
and
went
straight
up
to
doctor
potain
thanking
him
for
coming
and
apologizing
for
having
kept
him
waiting
potain
led
her
into
her
parents
room
he
was
much
disturbed
by
the
uneven
beating
of
her
heart
stormier
than
he
had
ever
heard
it
that
is
because
i
just
rushed
foolishly
on
my
bicycle
to
see
you
doctor
i
recognized
you
a
long
way
off
so
the
doctor
looked
closely
at
the
young
girl
her
eyes
shone
with
abnormal
brightness
he
sounded
her
but
found
nothing
wrong
except
the
irregularity
of
her
heart
he
sent
esperance
back
to
the
salon
so
that
he
could
talk
with
her
father
alone
the
duke
hastened
to
apologize
for
having
come
thus
without
notice
he
was
staying
at
the
château
of
with
doctor
potain
and
when
he
heard
that
the
doctor
was
leaving
for
he
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
to
come
and
ask
pardon
he
talked
a
long
time
with
ardent
almost
brotherly
tenderness
asked
when
esperance
thought
of
making
her
appearance
at
the
urging
her
to
play
camille
and
spoke
with
considerable
praise
of
heroine
the
character
of
the
young
girl
seems
to
have
been
caught
alive
i
criticize
her
only
for
her
hardness
but
esperance
replied
quickly
that
hardness
is
simply
a
light
veneer
the
result
of
her
education
who
knew
nothing
of
life
except
through
the
disillusioned
account
of
her
friend
in
the
convent
would
soon
become
human
if
had
a
less
complicated
psychology
she
stopped
and
was
silent
a
minute
the
duke
looked
at
her
all
the
world
has
not
the
candour
of
a
count
styvens
he
said
this
unfortunate
sentence
exactly
answered
a
fleeting
thought
that
was
passing
in
esperance
brain
so
much
the
worse
for
the
world
she
said
quietly
and
left
him
her
father
and
doctor
potain
came
in
at
this
moment
what
are
you
plotting
against
me
she
said
going
up
to
them
françois
caressed
her
velvet
cheek
you
shall
soon
know
the
duke
had
remained
dumbfounded
in
his
chair
the
sudden
mastery
of
this
child
who
had
for
the
second
time
rebuked
him
touched
his
pride
his
instinct
as
an
irresistible
charmer
told
him
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
still
he
could
not
define
in
what
way
he
appealed
to
her
was
it
physical
was
it
of
a
higher
order
after
a
little
cogitation
he
concluded
that
that
was
the
secret
however
he
was
wrong
esperance
was
subjugated
by
the
attraction
of
his
masculinity
and
strength
which
was
subtly
energetic
and
audacious
his
taste
and
independence
appealed
to
her
artistic
nature
his
vibrant
voice
the
grace
of
his
slender
hands
the
lightness
of
his
spirits
always
alert
his
superiority
at
every
sport
made
the
duke
de
quite
like
a
real
hero
of
romance
he
had
expected
to
subjugate
the
little
parisian
idol
and
found
himself
thwarted
by
her
this
rather
annoyed
him
and
he
vowed
to
conquer
her
doctor
potain
who
was
looking
at
his
watch
now
chimed
in
with
my
dear
duke
we
must
be
thinking
of
leaving
the
boat
will
not
wait
for
us
charles
de
morlay
thanked
his
farm
hosts
and
after
bowing
elegantly
over
mme
darbois
hand
looked
for
esperance
jean
said
professor
darbois
look
and
see
if
you
can
find
esperance
and
tell
her
to
come
and
say
to
our
dear
doctor
but
jean
returned
alone
esperance
was
not
to
be
found
she
had
flown
she
had
not
forgotten
about
the
boat
said
the
young
actor
perhaps
she
has
gone
on
her
bicycle
to
gather
news
of
old
mother
kabastron
who
is
very
that
is
about
ten
minutes
distance
from
here
i
will
ride
ahead
on
my
bicycle
the
duke
laughed
gaily
and
prepared
a
scathing
witticism
with
which
to
wither
the
young
girl
but
he
did
not
have
the
pleasure
of
delivering
it
to
esperance
who
had
hidden
herself
behind
her
portrait
at
the
foot
of
the
rook
she
reappeared
much
later
and
was
rebuked
by
her
father
for
having
shown
such
discourtesy
to
his
guests
you
know
very
well
papa
dear
that
i
am
very
grateful
to
doctor
potain
and
i
should
not
have
gone
away
if
he
had
been
alone
and
mme
darbois
looked
at
each
other
and
at
esperance
yes
my
dear
little
mother
the
duke
makes
himself
too
agreeable
for
your
big
daughter
but
said
the
philosopher
i
have
never
noticed
it
you
were
absorbed
in
a
philosophic
discussion
with
the
doctor
and
the
duke
was
not
speaking
very
loud
can
you
not
be
more
definite
asked
françois
darbois
a
little
nervously
jean
intervened
may
i
say
something
certainly
my
boy
well
then
i
heard
the
duke
de
make
fun
of
the
honesty
of
count
styvens
and
at
that
esperance
abruptly
broke
off
the
conversation
françois
turned
towards
esperance
that
is
so
she
said
kissing
her
father
so
tell
me
that
you
are
not
angry
with
your
little
daughter
for
answer
he
kissed
her
tenderly
ah
if
i
could
find
a
way
to
shelter
you
from
so
much
admiration
from
being
so
much
sought
after
yet
i
do
know
very
well
how
to
defend
you
do
not
reproach
yourself
dear
father
you
have
been
so
good
so
trusting
i
will
never
betray
that
confidence
and
my
godfather
will
be
obliged
to
consume
all
his
own
horrid
prophecies
chapter
xviii
when
esperance
portrait
was
finished
the
family
could
not
admire
it
enough
maurice
who
was
for
himself
as
for
others
a
severe
critic
said
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
satisfied
with
my
own
work
little
cousin
you
have
brought
me
luck
so
if
my
uncle
will
permit
me
i
am
going
to
teach
you
to
ride
a
horse
my
goodness
said
madame
darbois
still
more
anxiety
for
us
but
esperance
clasped
her
hands
with
delight
the
first
riding
lessons
were
a
source
of
new
joy
for
esperance
maurice
was
an
excellent
rider
and
his
passion
for
horses
had
made
him
expert
in
handling
them
he
had
chosen
a
horse
for
his
cousin
from
a
stable
in
the
the
private
stable
of
the
count
marcus
de
treilles
the
horse
had
been
secured
at
a
bargain
on
account
of
some
blemishes
of
his
coat
he
was
very
gentle
however
and
the
darbois
soon
felt
confidence
in
him
doctor
potain
had
recommended
a
great
deal
of
physical
exercise
for
the
patient
to
counteract
the
excess
of
mental
work
which
had
weakened
her
heart
riding
fishing
walking
tennis
the
great
specialist
had
said
to
françois
darbois
will
be
the
best
thing
for
your
daughter
and
pressing
his
hand
let
her
get
married
as
soon
as
possible
long
excursions
about
the
little
island
became
for
esperance
the
most
delightful
part
of
their
country
life
very
often
and
madame
darbois
mlle
frahender
and
genevieve
hardouin
would
follow
in
the
brake
they
carried
their
lunch
with
them
and
ate
it
sometimes
in
the
little
wood
of
loret
sometimes
on
the
cliffs
amidst
the
broom
furze
and
asters
with
their
golden
flowers
and
silver
foliage
the
philosopher
fishing
fleet
was
composed
as
he
laughingly
said
of
a
blue
boat
with
blue
sails
and
a
little
swedish
whaler
françois
went
every
evening
about
six
to
set
the
nets
with
the
eldest
son
whose
portrait
maurice
intended
doing
for
the
following
salon
all
the
little
colony
gathered
at
nine
in
the
morning
on
the
beach
ready
with
baskets
to
bear
away
the
catch
maurice
jean
and
esperance
went
out
with
the
professor
to
get
the
nets
sometimes
they
had
been
put
far
out
and
then
esperance
would
row
with
the
others
for
which
rough
sport
her
delicate
arms
seemed
out
of
place
the
young
people
would
cry
out
with
delight
every
time
they
saw
the
fish
under
the
transparent
water
held
by
the
meshes
sometimes
they
had
quite
a
big
draught
two
or
three
rays
several
magnificent
soles
with
mullets
and
flounders
sometimes
a
great
lobster
would
give
the
net
such
tweaks
that
they
guessed
his
presence
before
they
saw
him
and
sometimes
it
happened
that
the
catch
was
nothing
but
a
few
sea
crabs
who
would
half
devour
the
other
unfortunate
fish
imprisoned
with
them
another
day
a
great
octopus
appeared
and
esperance
grew
pale
with
fright
at
sight
of
his
long
clinging
tentacles
esperance
often
made
a
selection
of
the
seaweeds
in
the
net
and
she
and
genevieve
commenced
an
album
in
which
they
pasted
in
fanciful
designs
these
plants
fine
as
straws
or
solid
and
sharp
of
colour
this
album
was
intended
for
mme
styvens
and
the
girls
worked
at
it
lovingly
maurice
would
sometimes
assist
them
with
his
advice
or
make
them
a
sketch
which
they
could
copy
as
carefully
as
their
beautiful
materials
would
admit
mlle
frahender
devoted
infinite
patience
to
gluing
the
tiniest
fibres
of
the
sea
plants
some
were
bright
pink
suggesting
in
formation
and
colour
the
little
red
fishing
boats
others
were
gold
with
their
slender
little
flowers
rising
in
clusters
the
long
supple
green
algaes
swelling
along
their
stems
into
little
round
beads
like
beads
of
jade
looked
as
though
they
wore
some
chinese
costume
as
the
album
grew
it
gave
promise
of
wonderful
surprises
on
the
first
of
september
françois
darbois
received
a
letter
from
count
styvens
asking
permission
to
come
and
submit
to
him
a
philosophical
work
that
he
had
just
finished
he
begged
to
present
his
compliments
to
mme
and
mlle
darbois
the
professor
read
the
letter
aloud
after
dinner
i
hardly
think
he
queried
that
i
can
well
refuse
this
pleasure
to
my
favourite
pupil
maurice
jean
the
old
mademoiselle
and
mme
darbois
seemed
very
happy
at
the
prospect
of
a
visit
from
the
count
he
is
a
very
good
musician
he
can
row
splendidly
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
concluded
the
philosopher
a
dispatch
was
sent
to
albert
styvens
telling
him
they
would
all
be
delighted
to
see
him
only
esperance
showed
some
reserve
and
maurice
cried
out
my
cousin
is
in
dread
of
musical
evenings
i
see
they
all
laughed
at
this
quip
which
had
a
very
close
resemblance
to
the
truth
yes
papa
but
no
music
after
dinner
our
evenings
would
be
lost
it
is
so
pleasant
to
go
for
long
walks
on
these
wonderful
moonlight
nights
the
piano
is
for
the
town
here
we
only
want
to
enjoy
the
harmonious
music
of
nature
the
sea
that
croons
or
roars
the
wind
that
whistles
whistles
or
scolds
the
plaint
of
the
in
the
storm
the
cry
of
the
frightened
gulls
and
cormorants
the
clicking
of
the
pebbles
rolled
over
by
the
waves
all
these
charm
me
strangely
and
i
often
sleep
on
the
little
beach
soothed
by
these
melodies
which
you
will
find
echoed
in
the
themes
of
our
great
masters
the
philosopher
drew
his
daughter
on
his
knee
very
well
we
will
not
mention
music
to
your
lover
the
word
had
slipped
out
but
it
stung
the
young
girl
however
she
would
not
let
her
resentment
appear
so
she
thought
they
all
accept
the
courting
of
albert
styvens
my
father
himself
is
part
of
the
conspiracy
against
me
she
led
genevieve
outside
and
confided
to
her
her
apprehensions
her
young
friend
did
not
deny
that
the
coming
of
count
styvens
had
the
appearance
to
all
of
an
approaching
proposal
of
marriage
my
god
said
esperance
pressing
her
friend
arm
it
seems
to
me
that
i
shall
never
be
able
to
say
i
am
so
happy
as
i
am
the
two
girls
were
sitting
on
a
little
mound
the
moon
was
reflected
in
a
sea
as
quiet
as
the
sky
see
said
esperance
that
is
the
image
of
my
life
at
this
moment
i
am
calm
happy
and
my
art
is
like
that
bright
star
it
brightens
everything
for
me
without
troubling
me
i
do
not
love
count
styvens
oh
she
went
on
in
answer
to
a
movement
from
genevieve
i
like
him
as
a
friend
but
i
do
not
love
him
i
know
he
is
a
gallant
gentleman
a
fine
musician
and
a
splendid
athlete
i
recognize
that
he
is
very
generous
and
that
he
is
entirely
unselfish
for
these
i
greatly
respect
him
but
these
qualities
alone
have
nothing
to
do
with
love
he
is
a
very
man
said
genevieve
his
arms
are
too
long
and
he
has
not
any
decided
colour
his
face
his
hair
his
eyes
are
all
of
a
neutral
tint
which
you
can
not
define
but
handsome
men
are
very
rare
esperance
did
not
answer
there
is
the
duke
de
too
do
you
like
him
any
better
the
moon
shone
full
on
esperance
face
great
heavens
dearie
exclaimed
genevieve
quickly
you
are
not
in
love
with
that
man
i
hope
do
speak
so
loud
said
esperance
frightened
no
i
am
not
in
love
with
the
duke
but
he
bothers
me
i
confess
he
is
continually
in
my
mind
and
the
thought
of
him
makes
the
blood
rush
to
my
heart
when
he
is
present
i
can
struggle
against
him
but
i
have
no
strength
against
the
picture
of
him
i
so
often
conjure
up
that
dominates
me
more
than
he
can
do
himself
that
seems
innocent
enough
but
i
know
very
well
all
the
same
that
i
find
every
excuse
for
dwelling
on
the
thought
of
him
no
i
do
not
love
him
but
still
she
murmured
very
low
genevieve
took
her
friend
in
her
arms
esperance
darling
save
yourself
think
of
the
downfall
of
your
mother
happiness
think
of
the
fearful
remorse
of
your
father
think
of
your
godfather
iniquitous
triumph
ah
i
beg
of
you
accept
the
count
love
become
his
wife
you
will
be
constrained
by
your
loyalty
to
save
your
father
honour
but
the
duke
my
father
honour
is
precious
to
me
and
you
see
i
am
defending
it
badly
said
esperance
she
wept
quietly
genevieve
drew
her
head
down
on
her
shoulder
esperance
kissed
her
come
we
must
go
back
it
is
getting
late
i
thank
you
genevieve
and
i
love
you
a
letter
arrived
the
next
morning
which
announced
that
the
count
would
pay
them
his
visit
on
thursday
there
were
just
three
days
before
his
coming
esperance
had
made
up
her
mind
after
her
talk
with
genevieve
to
accede
to
her
wishes
she
and
genevieve
went
to
inspect
the
room
that
had
been
prepared
for
the
count
it
was
a
little
square
apartment
very
nicely
arranged
on
the
floor
was
a
mat
with
red
and
white
squares
the
windows
looked
out
on
the
rocky
coast
the
young
people
decided
to
hang
some
small
variegated
laurels
from
the
ceiling
to
decorate
it
on
the
mantel
they
put
some
flower
vases
on
either
side
of
a
plaque
representing
the
golden
wedding
of
a
breton
couple
mme
darbois
opened
for
them
what
esperance
called
her
reliquary
and
they
found
there
flowers
and
ribbons
they
chose
wisteria
and
lavender
and
white
ribbons
then
went
to
work
on
their
wreath
a
large
crown
of
pretty
bunches
was
hung
from
satin
ribbons
when
it
was
ready
the
four
young
people
went
with
ladder
and
tools
to
hang
the
wreaths
maurice
standing
high
up
on
the
ladder
drove
in
the
peg
intended
to
hold
the
crown
as
reward
for
this
service
you
know
he
said
i
must
be
allowed
to
put
the
wreath
on
your
pretty
head
the
day
that
you
are
married
esperance
blushed
and
sighed
sadly
the
room
was
charming
in
its
decoration
though
when
it
was
finished
it
seemed
more
fit
for
a
young
girl
than
for
a
big
man
and
mme
darbois
went
to
meet
count
styvens
at
palais
françois
had
taken
his
glasses
and
pointed
out
the
boat
to
his
wife
there
is
the
count
said
mme
darbois
i
recognize
his
tall
figure
in
truth
albert
styvens
was
stepping
ashore
holding
in
his
arms
a
child
of
two
or
three
years
he
put
it
down
carefully
and
held
out
his
hand
to
a
poor
bent
old
woman
who
tried
to
straighten
up
to
thank
the
kind
gentleman
françois
and
germaine
came
up
to
the
young
man
who
pressed
the
philosopher
hand
and
presented
his
respects
to
mme
darbois
and
seeing
them
look
with
some
curiosity
at
the
old
woman
he
said
here
madame
are
some
good
people
deserving
of
your
kindness
mme
borderie
is
this
little
chap
grandmother
her
widowed
son
died
five
months
ago
of
tuberculosis
and
as
the
child
was
coughing
she
gave
everything
she
had
to
take
him
to
a
specialist
in
nantes
the
rough
sea
made
the
poor
little
fellow
ill
bringing
on
a
horrible
coughing
attack
the
poor
woman
was
too
weak
to
hold
him
during
his
convulsions
and
he
rolled
away
from
her
and
she
was
so
frightened
when
he
did
not
move
that
she
was
going
to
throw
herself
overboard
i
rushed
with
the
other
passengers
to
stop
her
we
calmed
her
finally
and
after
some
little
time
i
was
able
to
resuscitate
the
child
who
had
gone
off
in
a
fit
the
poor
woman
wept
as
he
talked
and
showed
a
banknote
he
had
slipped
into
her
hand
when
he
said
you
must
put
that
away
you
will
need
it
said
the
young
count
smiling
where
do
you
live
enquired
germaine
at
that
is
some
distance
away
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
and
feebly
shrugged
her
thin
shoulders
i
must
go
there
well
mme
borderie
we
will
take
you
there
without
further
parley
albert
picked
the
old
woman
up
lightly
and
set
her
down
in
the
brake
the
baby
was
deposited
on
her
knees
where
he
promptly
fell
asleep
the
count
little
trunk
found
place
beside
the
farmer
on
the
front
seat
a
basket
of
osier
which
the
young
man
had
handled
very
carefully
was
also
placed
in
the
brake
and
then
they
set
off
for
they
were
growing
anxious
at
the
farm
of
penhouet
at
the
of
and
mme
darbois
lies
some
way
from
the
point
des
poulains
and
the
roads
are
not
in
very
good
condition
especially
for
a
two
horse
brake
but
soon
the
wind
brought
the
sound
of
horse
hoofs
and
shortly
after
the
brake
drew
up
before
the
farm
albert
went
white
at
sight
of
esperance
she
had
come
forward
first
fearful
on
account
of
the
delay
mme
darbois
explained
the
cause
and
spoke
of
the
great
kindness
to
the
old
woman
and
her
boy
esperance
raised
her
pretty
eyes
damp
with
emotion
she
looked
at
albert
wishing
she
could
admire
his
person
as
much
as
she
did
his
mind
and
somehow
as
she
looked
she
was
agreeably
surprised
after
all
he
is
not
ugly
if
he
is
not
handsome
she
thought
and
he
is
so
genuinely
good
in
this
state
of
mind
she
left
her
hand
an
instant
in
his
and
he
trembled
the
young
people
were
anxious
to
lead
styvens
to
his
room
françois
however
was
not
allowed
to
accompany
them
they
marched
two
ahead
two
behind
with
the
count
between
like
a
prisoner
never
before
had
albert
seen
esperance
so
naturally
gay
never
had
he
found
her
more
fascinating
he
was
almost
delirious
with
happiness
life
seemed
to
him
only
possible
with
this
lovely
creature
for
his
wife
his
wife
such
an
accession
of
blood
gushed
into
his
heart
at
the
thought
that
he
stopped
giddily
jean
and
genevieve
who
closed
the
order
of
march
bumped
against
him
for
he
stopped
so
suddenly
that
they
thought
something
must
be
wrong
good
heavens
are
you
ill
asked
genevieve
the
count
smiled
excuse
me
i
am
sorry
it
was
my
mistake
as
they
went
on
again
maurice
whispered
to
his
cousin
you
know
esperance
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
make
that
man
happy
for
ever
i
can
see
it
why
it
seems
to
be
almost
a
duty
it
will
be
like
offending
providence
to
refuse
the
wonderful
future
that
lies
open
before
you
esperance
was
very
thoughtful
but
her
gay
spirits
returned
when
they
arrived
at
the
five
divisions
of
the
world
the
little
cortege
climbed
the
narrow
staircase
crossed
the
little
which
opened
on
the
opposite
side
on
a
court
cut
out
of
the
rock
each
room
had
a
door
on
this
natural
court
stopping
before
the
last
door
on
which
was
written
oceania
the
young
people
bowed
before
the
count
behold
the
prison
of
your
highness
when
he
was
left
alone
the
count
examined
his
surroundings
his
simple
chamber
seemed
to
him
sumptuous
he
smelt
the
flowers
on
the
mantelpiece
half
suspecting
that
they
were
an
attention
of
the
young
girls
the
wreath
suspended
from
the
ceiling
made
him
smile
it
had
been
hung
there
in
his
honour
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
marguerite
entered
followed
by
the
farmer
bringing
the
trunk
and
the
osier
basket
he
stopped
the
old
servant
as
she
was
going
out
wait
a
moment
and
help
me
please
he
cut
the
string
which
held
the
basket
and
took
out
four
bouquets
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
just
been
gathered
see
marguerite
the
name
is
pinned
on
each
bouquet
be
so
good
as
to
give
them
to
the
ladies
at
one
the
count
appeared
walking
up
and
down
before
the
door
of
the
he
did
not
want
to
be
the
first
one
to
enter
maurice
joined
him
i
would
love
to
see
the
portrait
of
your
cousin
said
albert
i
will
show
it
to
you
after
lunch
is
it
finished
yes
but
i
still
have
some
retouching
to
do
to
the
background
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
your
advice
upon
it
it
is
not
perhaps
exactly
necessary
yet
every
time
that
i
look
at
it
i
feel
the
need
of
some
slight
change
genevieve
and
esperance
came
in
together
the
contrast
of
this
double
entry
was
striking
genevieve
dark
with
regular
features
framed
by
a
mass
of
heavy
black
hair
esperance
shell
pink
aureoled
by
her
wavy
blonde
hair
genevieve
was
so
beautiful
that
maurice
was
moved
esperance
was
so
dazzling
that
the
count
mentally
praised
god
at
the
sight
of
her
he
was
warmly
thanked
for
his
pretty
flowers
several
blossoms
of
which
each
girl
had
pinned
to
her
dress
when
the
fish
appeared
maurice
rose
gravely
this
magnificent
fish
sir
he
said
to
albert
styvens
was
caught
by
me
for
you
it
is
for
you
to
decide
whether
to
share
it
with
us
or
whether
you
prefer
to
eat
it
alone
the
young
attaché
arose
and
with
more
humour
than
they
expected
from
him
took
the
platter
and
bowed
with
it
towards
mme
darbois
the
conversation
raced
merrily
along
and
they
were
soon
disputing
about
sports
the
count
learned
that
esperance
rode
on
horseback
he
was
delighted
and
inquired
if
he
would
be
able
to
procure
a
mount
jean
offered
his
but
the
count
who
knew
of
his
love
for
esperance
and
divined
what
a
joy
these
excursions
must
be
to
him
refused
this
sacrifice
the
farmer
wife
who
helped
to
wait
at
table
and
was
ignorant
of
social
customs
forthwith
entered
the
conversation
ah
if
madame
will
permit
me
i
can
bring
you
to
the
commandant
who
has
a
fine
horse
to
sell
you
may
have
no
fish
this
evening
said
the
professor
genially
as
i
was
away
meeting
you
i
could
not
put
out
my
net
but
we
did
it
father
said
esperance
and
i
hope
that
count
styvens
will
have
some
magnificent
luck
we
go
fishing
this
evening
so
you
are
a
fisherwoman
too
mademoiselle
we
fish
every
morning
and
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
you
join
us
said
the
girl
quietly
after
lunch
the
count
joined
the
four
young
people
in
a
ramble
along
the
cliffs
esperance
and
genevieve
went
arm
in
arm
the
three
young
men
followed
with
styvens
in
a
dream
of
delight
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
maurice
was
watching
genevieve
every
day
seeing
her
more
beautiful
and
abandoning
himself
without
much
effort
to
this
new
passion
jean
perliez
contemplated
esperance
and
smiled
sadly
if
gladly
too
at
the
thought
that
she
was
going
to
be
delivered
from
the
dangerous
duke
de
they
sat
down
on
a
high
rock
overlooking
the
little
beach
of
penhouet
and
remained
silent
for
a
while
how
very
beautiful
it
is
murmured
albert
at
last
you
love
the
sea
do
you
not
mlle
esperance
more
than
anything
else
in
nature
i
love
great
plains
too
but
i
like
them
best
because
they
are
like
the
sea
when
they
billow
under
the
breeze
you
do
like
the
mountains
at
all
asked
genevieve
oh
no
i
stifle
there
i
dream
at
night
that
they
are
pressing
in
to
strangle
me
i
went
to
cauterets
with
mama
after
she
had
bronchitis
i
spent
all
my
time
climbing
to
get
a
view
of
a
horizon
and
breathe
better
as
soon
as
mama
was
well
the
doctor
sent
us
away
saying
that
it
was
not
good
for
me
and
the
forest
asked
albert
the
forest
hides
the
sky
too
much
nothing
makes
me
as
sad
as
the
deep
woods
and
the
lakes
cousin
what
do
you
say
of
them
a
lake
makes
me
shiver
i
feel
constrained
before
a
lake
as
before
a
person
whom
i
know
to
be
false
and
perfidious
of
course
the
sea
is
dangerous
but
no
one
is
ignorant
of
its
caprices
its
violence
its
tragic
love
bouts
with
the
wind
the
sea
is
open
whether
in
laughter
or
fury
see
look
off
there
she
said
standing
upon
the
rock
this
evening
it
is
calm
as
a
lake
and
still
the
waves
are
all
rippling
preparing
for
an
assault
on
this
rock
it
is
so
immensely
alive
even
in
its
great
reserve
the
silhouette
of
the
young
girl
cut
against
the
horizon
was
blurred
by
the
passing
night
mist
she
seemed
a
flower
blooming
by
maurice
said
in
a
low
tone
to
genevieve
see
if
you
can
realize
this
picture
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
any
painter
one
of
the
aboriginals
might
have
succeeded
he
would
not
have
been
guided
by
any
of
the
conventions
that
are
introduced
in
all
the
arts
and
bar
the
way
to
the
realism
of
the
ideal
which
is
dear
to
all
true
artists
the
realism
of
the
ideal
is
very
true
but
how
are
you
going
to
make
amateurs
or
critics
feel
that
oh
replied
genevieve
with
much
conviction
there
is
always
an
amateur
of
the
beautiful
there
is
always
a
critic
who
describes
his
emotion
sincerely
it
is
for
them
that
i
give
my
tears
when
i
am
on
the
stage
esperance
dropped
on
her
knees
and
taking
her
friend
head
in
her
hands
you
are
always
right
genevieve
she
said
it
is
a
great
gift
to
have
you
for
a
friend
my
little
cousin
speaks
truth
concluded
maurice
genevieve
stretched
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
to
thank
him
the
young
man
kept
the
contact
of
that
charming
strong
hand
and
kissed
it
with
more
warmth
than
convention
required
monsieur
maurice
murmured
the
girl
with
trembling
lips
but
she
could
not
voice
a
reproach
she
got
up
to
hide
her
blushes
is
not
this
the
time
for
us
to
go
back
the
air
is
getting
sharp
and
you
have
no
wraps
esperance
count
styvens
stood
up
to
his
full
height
and
stretched
his
hands
to
his
little
idol
to
help
her
up
but
she
had
withdrawn
before
the
two
arms
stretched
towards
her
and
recoiled
in
a
kind
of
fright
did
i
startle
you
oh
no
she
said
nervously
but
i
was
dreaming
i
was
far
away
where
were
you
cousin
i
do
know
thoughts
are
sometimes
so
scattered
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
give
a
clear
impression
putting
her
hands
in
the
count
she
jumped
lightly
to
her
feet
the
young
men
led
the
girls
back
to
the
farm
and
silence
descended
upon
the
five
divisions
of
the
globe
but
love
made
every
one
of
these
young
creatures
somewhat
unsettled
and
it
was
long
before
either
of
them
slept
esperance
and
genevieve
talked
low
and
long
silences
broke
their
confidences
count
styvens
had
brought
cigarettes
for
maurice
and
jean
all
three
stayed
and
talked
a
long
time
in
the
painter
room
alone
with
men
styvens
lost
all
the
timidity
that
sometimes
made
him
awkward
his
broad
and
cultivated
mind
his
humanitarian
philosophy
unaffected
by
his
religious
beliefs
the
sincere
simplicity
with
which
he
expressed
himself
made
a
great
impression
on
jean
and
maurice
that
man
said
the
latter
to
his
friend
is
of
another
epoch
an
epoch
when
he
would
have
been
a
hero
or
a
martyr
perhaps
he
may
yet
be
both
murmured
jean
chapter
xix
next
morning
albert
styvens
asked
maurice
to
show
him
the
portrait
of
esperance
he
gazed
at
it
a
long
time
in
silent
admiration
he
could
gaze
his
fill
at
a
portrait
without
outraging
the
conventions
what
marvellous
delicacy
oh
the
blue
of
the
eyes
the
mother
of
pearl
of
the
temples
he
sat
down
quivering
with
emotion
and
looked
frankly
at
maurice
i
love
your
cousin
you
know
that
do
you
maurice
nodded
i
have
loved
her
for
a
year
and
you
see
me
here
still
hesitating
to
speak
to
her
father
why
because
i
know
that
she
does
not
love
me
oh
i
believe
he
went
on
sadly
i
hope
at
least
that
she
does
feel
some
friendship
for
me
but
if
she
declines
my
proposal
what
else
would
ever
matter
to
me
maurice
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
your
mother
he
queried
my
mother
loves
esperance
devotedly
and
she
has
a
very
real
admiration
for
your
uncle
as
well
she
is
very
religious
philosophical
books
which
deny
nothingness
and
proclaim
the
ideal
have
been
a
great
comfort
to
her
in
her
voluntary
solitude
she
would
be
very
happy
to
know
if
i
could
be
happy
but
objected
maurice
i
am
afraid
that
my
cousin
does
not
wish
to
give
up
her
art
the
stage
yes
i
am
aware
of
that
but
my
mother
and
i
have
not
the
stupid
prejudices
of
the
multitude
undoubtedly
this
union
under
such
conditions
would
estrange
us
from
many
of
our
so
called
friends
and
i
should
have
to
give
up
the
diplomatic
service
but
that
would
not
trouble
me
no
he
went
on
resting
his
hand
on
maurice
knee
the
hard
part
would
be
to
see
her
every
evening
surrounded
by
the
admiration
of
so
many
men
i
suffered
when
she
was
playing
at
the
vaudeville
and
then
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
child
but
i
heard
them
all
commenting
on
her
beauty
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
control
myself
what
shall
i
be
if
she
becomes
my
wife
ah
my
wife
my
wife
i
really
believe
renaud
that
her
refusal
would
drive
me
mad
so
i
hesitate
hope
is
the
refuge
of
the
sick
and
i
am
very
sick
sick
at
heart
maurice
felt
strangely
drawn
to
this
man
so
simple
and
so
frank
and
so
innately
refined
in
thought
from
i
am
your
ally
and
i
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
call
you
cousin
as
to
her
artistic
career
esperance
will
have
to
sacrifice
that
for
you
we
will
all
try
to
lead
her
to
this
decision
but
you
must
not
make
her
unhappy
about
it
i
am
already
disposed
to
all
concessions
except
those
which
touch
my
honour
and
i
assure
you
that
my
mother
and
i
are
both
ready
to
scorn
all
idle
talk
the
girls
came
up
with
jean
perliez
the
count
said
your
portrait
is
a
perfect
likeness
and
is
moreover
a
beautiful
picture
but
he
exclaimed
you
are
all
ready
for
riding
yes
we
are
going
to
wo
you
come
with
us
mama
little
mademoiselle
and
genevieve
are
going
in
the
carriage
to
carry
some
provisions
to
poor
old
mother
borderie
your
invitation
is
very
tempting
and
i
am
going
to
surprise
you
perhaps
by
declining
the
farmer
arranged
to
have
the
horse
here
for
this
morning
but
he
comes
accompanied
by
many
warnings
and
i
want
to
try
him
out
when
you
are
not
here
if
perliez
will
be
my
guide
to
i
shall
be
glad
i
hope
you
will
offer
me
the
same
chance
again
esperance
smiled
delightfully
suppose
we
have
lunch
there
said
maurice
papa
would
be
left
alone
too
long
and
i
want
to
see
if
styvens
can
fish
as
well
as
ride
we
will
come
back
to
pull
up
the
nets
about
five
and
then
we
will
have
tea
in
the
boat
the
carriage
was
ready
the
horses
saddled
the
count
had
the
pleasure
of
assisting
the
young
actress
to
mount
and
then
esperance
and
maurice
set
out
together
followed
by
the
brake
the
count
and
jean
perliez
took
a
more
roundabout
and
a
steeper
way
albert
wanted
to
study
the
character
of
his
horse
the
first
to
arrive
at
were
to
await
the
others
and
together
they
were
to
go
to
visit
old
mother
borderie
the
dwelling
was
one
of
the
white
breton
houses
with
thatched
roof
there
were
three
rooms
the
kitchen
where

narrow
beds

with
carved
wood
in
the
second

four
similar
beds
large
bunches
of
box
which
had
been
blessed
ornamented
the
beds
where
the
woman
four
children
had
died
the
father
of
the
little
grandson
was
the
last
to
go
the
kitchen
was
unlighted
except
when
the
door
was
open
the
bedrooms
had
each
one
narrow
opening
like
a
loophole
the
old
woman
was
sitting
beside
the
hearth
by
the
side
of
which
was
an
armful
of
furze
the
evening
meal
was
slowly
cooking
in
a
marmite
suspended
from
a
hook
between
her
knees
she
held
the
child
combing
his
hair
she
stopped
when
she
saw
the
visitors
enter
and
the
child
ran
towards
the
count
who
took
him
in
his
arms
the
presents
they
had
brought
were
unwrapped
by
the
girls
blouses
trousers
clothes
for
the
baby
a
woollen
dress
a
muslin
dress
with
two
beautiful
fichus
in

box
contained

and
six
jars
of
preserves
another
smoked
bacon
salt
pork
two
bottles
of
candy
and
prunes
and
six
bottles
of
red
wine
the
old
woman
looked
caressingly
felt
everything
with
her
old
knotted
fingers
while
the
tears
ran
down
the
furrows
that
sorrow
had
hollowed
in
each
cheek
ah
if
my
son
had
had
such
good
things
perhaps
he
would
not
have
died
and
she
stood
before
the
food
with
her
hands
crossed
her
eyes
lost
in
the
distance
among
old
far
off
memories
esperance
undressed
the
little
fellow
and
genevieve
looked
for
water
to
wash
him
before
putting
on
his
new
clothes
but
despairing
of
finding
any
she
tried
to
draw
the
old
woman
back
from
her
dream
water
she
said
i
have
been
too
weak
these
three
days
to
go
to
the
well
there
is
none
here
but
what
is
in
that
pitcher
there
on
the
board
but
do
take
it
the
baby
is
always
thirsty
genevieve
raised
her
beautiful
arm
in
its
loose
sleeve
and
picked
up
the
pitcher
she
looked
at
the
water
and
asked
with
surprise
this
is
the
water
you
drink
yes
the
cistern
is
empty
on
account
of
the
drought
we
have
had
these
two
months
and
the
spring
is
a
mile
away
it
is
too
far
for
me
and
especially
for
the
child
who
is
not
strong
i
do
dare
leave
him
alone
in
the
house
here
and
i
do
dare
leave
him
with
the
neighbours
they
are
too
rough
and
they
knock
the
little
fellow
about
and
he
does
understand
it
is
only
done
in
joke
and
he
cries
and
calls
for
me
and
gets
such
a
fever
that
he
almost
died
one
day
when
i
left
him
to
go
do
washing
still
further
away
but
could
you
get
the
neighbours
to
bring
you
some
water
asked
esperance
my
young
lady
there
are
thirteen
in
that
family
and
one
of
them
is
ill
to
death
she
added
sighing
albert
joined
in
where
is
the
spring
over
there
near
the
church
in
the
next
village
very
good

three

there
he
said
calling
maurice
and
jean
and
we
will
bring
you
back
lots
of
water
wait
till
i
give
you
she
opened
the
cupboard
here
is
the
pail
take
care
it
is
very
heavy
albert
began
to
laugh
come
along
my
friends
i
have
got
an
idea
esperance
watched
him
as
he
went
out
and
for
an
instant
she
loved
him
while
waiting
for
the
young
men
to
return
she
settled
her
mother
on
a
chest
the
only
chair
in
the
house
was
a
straw
with
a
high
back
on
which
the
old
borderie
was
sitting
and
which
she
had
not
thought
of
offering
no
doubt
said
mme
darbois
in
a
low
tone
little
by
little
she
has
had
to
sell
everything
she
had
the
girls
opened
a
bottle
of
wine
the
jar
of
prunes
and
the
jar
of
candy
and
arranged
them
on
the
board
pointed
out
by
the
poor
woman
who
thanked
them
simply
and
said
ah
my
little
lad
how
good
it
will
be
for
him
and
for
you
too
you
know
now
drink
some
wine
and
take
some
coffee
said
esperance
caressing
the
grandmother
hands
i
have
got
enough
wood
to
boil
the
water
madame
darbois
looked
at
the
girls
contritely
wood
she
said
and
we
never
thought
of
it
if
you
are
poor
you
do
have
to
think
muttered
the
old
woman
a
contraction
of
the
heart
the
sting
of
remorse
pierced
mme
darbois
and
the
two
girls
you
shall
have
plenty
of
wood
mme
borderie
that
will
be
very
good
kind
lady
for
then
we
can
have
a
little
heat
and
that
is
what
the
little
one
needs
the
sun
never
comes
into
my
room
ah
it
ca
the
hole
is
not
big
enough
and
then
in
the
evening
when
the
fog
begins
my
little
boy
he
coughs
so
and
that
makes
me
shiver
then
i
take
him
in
my
bed
but
my
blood
is
not
warm
enough
so
he
ca
get
warm
ah
but
that
will
be
good
for
him
to
have
wood
thank
you
for
the
first
time
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
for
she
had
almost
forgotten
how
to
smile
her
life
had
been
nearly
all
tears
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
in
fright
what
may
that
noise
be
at
the
door
a
cart
stopped
on
the
cart
a
big
barrel
here
is
some
water
mme
borderie
that
we
are
going
to
pour
into
your
cistern
with
the
help
of
the
carter
and
maurice
albert
got
to
work
and
behold
the
cistern
half
full
albert
tried
the
pump
do
waste
any
in
heaven
name
cried
the
old
woman
no
no
never
mind
anyway
there
is
another
barrel
on
its
way
in
fact
another
cart
was
stopping
before
the
door
this
barrel
being
smaller
albert
impatient
at
the
peasant
slowness
picked
it
up
himself
and
rolling
it
along
emptied
it
like
the
first
in
the
cistern
look
there
will
you
mother
cried
out
the
second
carter
that
is
any
cheap
water
the
fine
gentleman
has
given
a
hundred
francs
to
the
town
so
you
could
have
that
water
there
the
count
coloured
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
he
thought
that
esperance
had
not
heard
but
he
met
her
contrite
glance
full
of
gratitude
with
genevieve
help
she
washed
the
little
fellow
who
was
very
docile
sniffing
with
pleasure
the
good
smell
of
these
ladies
bathed
combed
in
his
new
clothes
he
was
a
darling
i
do
know
you
any
longer
little
boy
who
are
you
chuckled
the
old
woman
and
she
kissed
the
child
saying
on
sunday
we
will
go
to
mass
you
will
be
as
fine
as
the
other
little
boys
she
saw
all
her
visitors
to
the
door
and
when
esperance
jumped
on
her
horse
you
are
afraid
up
there
you
know
horses
are
exactly
treacherous
but
they
are
uncertain
and
then
these
dreadful
flies
make
them
wild
madame
my
good
gentlemen
thank
you
good
luck
the
four
riders
returned
together
passing
the
little
village
of
debers
they
had
to
stop
a
big
hay
wagon
barred
the
way
the
peasant
who
was
driving
was
abominably
drunk
he
swore
and
struck
his
horses
and
jerked
them
violently
towards
the
ditch
maurice
ordered
him
to
make
way
he
laughed
foolishly
and
swore
at
them
insultingly
maurice
and
the
count
started
forward
and
the
peasant
menaced
them
with
the
scythe
resting
on
the
seat
beside
him
in
a
flash
albert
leapt
from
his
horse
threw
the
reins
to
maurice
and
went
straight
to
the
drunkard
the
fellow
tried
to
brandish
his
scythe
but
already
albert
had
wrenched
it
from
him
and
threw
it
aside
then
seizing
the
man
he
pulled
him
down
on
his
knees
and
held
him
there
until
he
begged
for
pardon
the
rustic
suddenly
sobered
and
raging
with
impatience
paid
in
full
the
apologies
exacted
by
the
count
before
he
was
allowed
to
get
up
jean
during
this
contest
had
led
the
horses
out
of
their
way
the
driver
pale
with
fury
swung
his
whip
at
large
and
it
struck
esperance
horse
the
poor
beast
mad
with
fright
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
started
out
on
a
dizzy
run
albert
saw
at
a
glance
the
only
possible
way
to
stop
his
course
go
to
the
left
and
cut
across
the
road
he
cried
i
take
the
right
and
he
put
his
horse
across
the
fields
esperance
horse
did
not
follow
the
bend
of
the
road
as
styvens
had
expected
blinded
by
fright
it
made
straight
ahead
towards
the
cliffs
once
on
the
rocks
there
was
the
precipice
and
certain
death
the
count
horse
leapt
as
if
it
understood
what
it
had
to
do
the
count
came
up
just
as
esperance
lost
her
seat
and
fell
with
one
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
her
lovely
blonde
hair
swept
the
earth
twenty
yards
more
and
that
exquisite
little
head
would
be
crashed
upon
the
rocks
with
a
desperate
effort
albert
by
spurring
his
horse
furiously
was
able
to
reach
her
horse
head
seize
him
by
the
bridle
and
swing
himself
to
the
ground
braced
against
the
rocks
he
succeeded
in
halting
the
trembling
beast
and
bent
in
anguish
over
the
fainting
girl
but
just
as
he
freed
esperance
feet
the
horse
still
trampling
and
plunging
kicked
him
full
in
the
head
he
went
down
like
a
stone
maurice
and
jean
had
now
come
up
one
calmed
the
horse
the
other
went
to
the
aid
of
the
wounded
man
albert
his
face
streaming
with
blood
was
murmuring
feebly
no
she
is
not
dead
no
she
is
not
dead
he
fell
back
unconscious
jean
was
kneeling
beside
esperance
he
raised
his
eyes
to
maurice
moist
with
tears
but
bright
with
hope
she
is
alive
he
said
she
has
just
moaned
feebly
it
is
only
a
little
way
to
the
farm
hurry
maurice
go
for
help
god
grant
the
count
wound
may
not
be
fatal
the
peasants
who
were
haymaking
nearby
had
left
their
work
and
come
upon
the
scene
one
man
offered
his
cart
and
albert
was
lifted
unconscious
and
bloodstained
and
laid
on
the
hay
esperance
had
come
to
her
senses
she
could
see
but
could
not
understand
a
peasant
woman
kneeling
beside
her
washed
her
face
in
water
from
a
pool
in
the
rocks
suddenly
she
recollected
her
comrade
jean
she
cried
with
fright
jean
count
styvens
jean
sorrowfully
showed
her
the
wagon
where
he
lay
esperance
leaning
on
the
young
actor
stood
up
to
be
able
to
see
and
a
great
sob
shook
her
from
head
to
feet
my
god
my
god
she
moaned
is
he
killed
no
i
do
think
so
not
yet
at
least
and
his
mother
his
poor
mother
but
what
happened
i
remember
it
is
terrible
jean
described
what
had
happened
and
how
the
count
had
snatched
her
from
certain
death
esperance
began
to
cry
bitterly
meantime
maurice
was
returning
with
the
victoria
in
which
were
and
madame
darbois
the
wagon
was
sent
on
its
way
very
slowly
françois
stepped
down
quickly
and
took
his
daughter
in
his
arms
intending
to
carry
her
to
the
carriage
my
father
i
am
able
to
walk
she
stifled
with
sobs
but
he
the
philosopher
put
her
in
the
victoria
beside
her
mother
and
begged
jean
to
stay
with
them
then
he
rejoined
the
cart
and
climbed
up
beside
maurice
who
was
supporting
the
limp
head
on
the
hay
the
professor
had
studied
a
little
medicine
he
could
see
that
the
wound
was
grave
but
the
young
man
was
robust
and
he
allowed
himself
to
hope
maurice
recounted
the
accident
with
all
its
details
brave
fellow
said
françois
taking
the
cold
hand
and
tears
he
could
scarcely
restrain
began
to
fill
his
eyes
soon
they
all
arrived
at
the
farm
marguerite
as
she
had
been
instructed
had
prepared
the
darbois
room
to
receive
the
wounded
man
esperance
exhausted
was
put
to
bed
and
was
soon
asleep
watched
over
by
mlle
frahender
who
prayed
silently
counting
over
her
rosary
they
had
difficulty
in
moving
albert
styvens
his
great
body
was
heavy
and
difficult
to
raise
finally
after
they
had
washed
and
bound
up
his
head
they
succeeded
in
undressing
him
and
making
him
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
the
great
bed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
opened
his
eyes
and
in
response
to
the
anxious
faces
leaning
over
him
smiled
sweetly
and
she
he
asked
in
a
feeble
voice
thanks
to
your
courage
she
is
all
right
said
mme
darbois
you
have
the
blessings
of
a
grateful
mother
she
put
the
young
man
hand
to
her
lips
two
warm
tears
fell
down
on
it
the
young
man
trembled
then
his
face
grew
radiant
they
followed
his
glance
on
the
threshold
stood
esperance
leaning
upon
genevieve
a
of
profound
sleep
had
completely
restored
her
she
had
waked
suddenly
and
seeing
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
beside
her
had
asked
how
is
count
albert
and
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
both
women
she
had
got
up
she
wanted
to
be
sure
she
wanted
to
see
the
wounded
man
looked
at
her
fixedly
tell
me
that
i
am
not
dreaming
he
implored
albert
she
murmured
going
up
to
him
i
owe
you
my
life
she
knelt
beside
the
bed
and
her
delicate
hand
rested
on
his
strong
hand
god
is
very
good
he
sighed
closing
his
eyes
he
went
so
pale
that
françois
came
forward
quickly
to
feel
his
pulse
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
covering
the
patient
arm
with
the
sheet
again
looked
at
his
watch
if
only
this
doctor
would
come
he
said
almost
immediately
the
head
doctor
from
the
barracks
at
palais
was
announced
he
was
a
man
of
forty
handsome
a
little
but
he
understood
his
business
well
enough
he
diagnosed
the
wound
as
a
fracture
of
the
head
and
dressed
and
bandaged
it
promising
to
return
that
evening
with
a
soothing
potion
for
esperance
he
prescribed
a
healing
lotion
for
the
many
little
scratches
which
were
of
no
gravity
the
girl
was
so
insistent
that
she
was
allowed
to
watch
beside
her
deliverer
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
also
stayed
in
the
room
ready
in
case
she
needed
help
a
dispatch
was
sent
to
the
countess
quiet
redescended
on
the
farm
a
heavy
atmosphere
of
sadness
seemed
to
envelop
it
lunch
was
served
disjointedly
nobody
cared
to
eat
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
had
been
relieved
by
the
maid
but
they
were
anxious
to
return
to
their
posts
and
when
françois
began
to
fold
his
napkin
they
pushed
back
their
chairs
and
quickly
returned
to
the
the
patient
was
becoming
delirious
the
name
of
esperance
was
continually
recurrent
in
his
confused
talk
once
the
young
girl
trembled
the
count
expression
had
become
so
ferocious
that
she
was
terrified
genevieve
and
the
old
mademoiselle
had
just
come
in
she
clung
to
them
clenching
her
hands
and
hiding
her
face
she
pointed
to
the
count
who
with
his
brows
contracted
and
his
lips
sternly
set
was
talking
volubly
all
three
trembled
he
ground
out
the
name
of
the
duke
of
in
a
kind
of
roar
mlle
frahender
more
composed
than
the
girls
took
the
potion
left
by
the
doctor
to
calm
the
fever
when
it
should
become
too
raging
esperance
hardened
herself
against
the
weakness
which
had
made
her
leave
the
bedside
and
while
genevieve
held
the
bandaged
head
she
poured
the
liquid
between
the
sick
man
lips
at
the
same
time
she
spoke
to
him
very
gently
the
voice
had
more
effect
than
the
potion
the
wounded
man
grew
gradually
calmer
and
still
unconscious
slept
quietly
once
more
then
esperance
sank
back
in
an
easy
chair
begging
mlle
frahender
to
see
that
no
one
should
make
any
noise
when
the
doctor
returned
at
nine
he
found
the
patient
had
been
sleeping
for
an
hour
he
was
well
satisfied
and
waited
a
more
before
disturbing
him
to
dress
the
wound
he
could
say
nothing
definitely
as
yet
except
that
the
patient
had
lost
no
ground
he
took
his
leave
until
next
day
and
when
françois
asked
him
to
insist
upon
his
daughter
rest
he
refused
saying
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
she
risks
nothing
except
a
slight
fatigue
and
she
is
performing
a
good
work
it
may
be
that
she
is
the
real
doctor
a
telegram
from
madame
styvens
announced
that
she
would
arrive
next
day
with
the
doctor
who
had
attended
albert
from
childhood
and
a
friend
she
asked
that
rooms
be
reserved
at
the
hotel
at
palais
but
françois
would
reserve
only
the
five
divisions
of
the
world
for
the
three
travellers
they
prepared
one
of
the
rooms
as
a
for
the
countess
and
maurice
and
jean
went
to
lodge
at
the
farmer
it
was
with
infinite
discretion
that
esperance
broke
the
news
of
his
mother
coming
to
albert
poor
mother
he
said
she
must
be
living
through
hours
of
anguish
in
her
anxiety
but
the
doctor
said
that
i
am
out
of
danger
what
you
were
not
asleep
he
smiled
with
the
almost
childish
smile
of
the
very
ill
returning
to
life
then
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
henceforth
she
threatened
him
gently
with
a
slender
finger
he
stretched
his
hand
out
towards
her
she
pressed
it
tenderly
be
careful
albert
do
move
too
much
they
had
completely
dropped
the
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
and
this
intimacy
filled
the
young
man
heart
with
joy
chapter
xx
françois
had
made
a
special
arrangement
with
the
captain
of
the
so
that
the
charming
countess
need
not
risk
travelling
with
geese
and
pigs
at
quiberon
he
had
reserved
a
special
room
that
she
might
have
at
least
an
hour
of
rest
she
went
pale
as
death
when
she
saw
the
philosopher
and
his
wife
waiting
for
her
at
the
train
although
they
had
sent
her
reassuring
telegrams
every
few
hours
but
feared
that
something
serious
might
have
happened
while
she
was
on
the
way
françois
said
with
emotion
as
he
kissed
her
trembling
hand
everything
is
going
well
madame
be
assured
she
breathed
deeply
and
the
colour
returned
to
her
face
which
was
still
so
youthful
in
appearance
she
presented
doctor
chartier
who
had
been
present
at
albert
birth
and
had
cared
for
him
ever
since
and
general
van
berger
several
peasant
women
who
had
heard
the
news
of
her
coming
pressed
around
offering
flowers
your
son
is
saved
madame
they
said
her
mother
soul
was
overcome
with
sorrow
and
joy
for
she
felt
that
they
spoke
the
truth
esperance
who
had
been
watching
for
her
coming
threw
herself
into
her
arms
sobbing
but
quickly
realizing
her
impatience
come
come
he
is
expecting
you
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
keep
calm
the
poor
woman
cast
herself
upon
the
bed
and
embraced
her
son
interrupting
her
sobs
with
words
of
endearment
crying
laughing
delirious
with
happiness
for
he
was
indeed
alive
and
she
had
feared
but
she
cast
away
the
terrible
thought
the
doctor
from
the
barracks
entered
for
a
consultation
with
doctor
chartier
who
issued
the
smiling
command
leave
him
to
the
doctors
now
good
ladies
the
countess
pressed
a
last
kiss
on
her
son
hand
and
went
away
with
genevieve
and
esperance
after
doctor
chartier
had
examined
the
wound
he
congratulated
his
you
have
cared
for
our
patient
admirably
and
you
will
find
that
his
mother
is
eternally
grateful
to
you
and
indeed
the
countess
did
press
his
hands
and
expressed
with
noble
simplicity
her
gratitude
to
everyone
for
all
that
had
been
done
for
her
son
the
doctors
were
to
return
in
the
evening
albert
begged
his
mother
to
take
a
little
rest
if
i
have
your
word
dear
mama
i
declare
to
you
i
will
go
to
sleep
i
am
so
relieved
to
know
your
anxiety
is
over
i
will
take
care
of
your
mother
albert
said
esperance
you
take
your
medicine
and
go
to
sleep
genevieve
has
promised
to
come
and
fetch
me
if
you
do
not
the
countess
smiled
as
she
went
out
with
the
young
girl
she
looked
at
the
pretty
face
which
was
still
scarred
by
the
marks
of
her
fall
she
listened
trembling
with
terror
but
admiring
the
coolness
and
courage
of
her
adored
son
while
the
little
artist
gave
her
an
account
of
the
accident
then
she
sent
for
maurice
and
jean
perliez
that
she
might
thank
them
repeatedly
she
loved
them
all
for
their
goodness
and
simplicity
the
maid
is
at
your
disposal
madame
i
will
send
her
to
you
said
esperance
she
bent
to
kiss
the
countess
hand
but
found
her
face
caressed
by
it
my
daughter
my
dear
daughter
said
the
countess
kissing
her
tenderly
esperance
went
away
mystified
and
in
a
daze
in
eight
days
doctor
chartier
left
them
the
invalid
was
now
convalescent
but
still
confined
to
his
room
for
several
days
the
head
wound
was
closing
little
by
little
happily
the
cut
had
been
a
clean
one
and
there
had
been
no
complications
but
fatigue
was
to
be
avoided
and
the
young
count
was
not
allowed
to
exert
himself
in
any
way
he
usually
settled
himself
in
a
big
near
the
window
and
while
his
mother
did
some
embroidering
esperance
read
aloud
every
two
hours
they
were
relieved
by
madame
darbois
and
genevieve
as
to
maurice
he
had
made
a
plot
in
concert
with
esperance
and
albert
of
offering
a
portrait
of
her
son
to
the
charming
countess
baron
van
berger
played
endless
games
of
cards
with
françois
the
days
passed
quickly
and
everyone
seemed
happy
esperance
face
was
as
lovely
as
ever
for
every
scar
had
disappeared
the
accident
to
count
styvens
had
made
a
great
stir
in
the
fashionable
world
where
the
young
belgian
diplomat
was
much
esteemed
and
even
loved
and
the
artistic
world
was
interested
on
account
of
esperance
telegrams
and
letters
came
in
every
day
the
duke
de
had
shown
such
an
interest
that
the
object
of
it
the
count
grew
exasperated
the
duke
had
even
expressed
a
desire
to
come
and
see
the
sufferer
but
the
philosopher
warned
by
jean
perliez
replied
coldly
pleading
the
doctor
orders
at
last
the
day
came
when
the
count
was
permitted
to
leave
the
sick
room
he
was
allowed
to
take
a
walk
and
felt
so
strong
that
when
maurice
offered
his
assistance
he
refused
it
quite
gaily
esperance
and
the
countess
walked
on
either
side
of
him
but
suddenly
he
grew
dizzy
and
stretched
out
his
arms
maurice
started
forward
to
catch
him
as
he
tottered
and
the
count
saved
himself
by
catching
hold
of
the
shoulder
of
esperance
under
this
heavy
burden
esperance
shuddered
and
nearly
fell
and
grew
so
pale
that
genevieve
came
to
her
give
me
your
arm
darling
and
walk
a
little
behind
with
me
you
seem
so
shaken
oh
i
guess
why
maurice
and
general
van
berger
supported
albert
who
had
lost
his
and
was
a
little
crestfallen
yes
i
have
been
tortured
again
by
some
sort
of
repugnance
said
esperance
i
know
that
i
should
devote
myself
to
loving
that
man
but
that
will
make
for
the
happiness
of
all
who
love
you
yes
but
it
will
be
like
condemning
myself
to
death
genevieve
shivered
and
grew
silent
while
pressing
esperance
close
to
her
side
to
give
her
courage
her
friend
confidences
troubled
her
sadly
she
also
saw
the
shade
of
sorrow
hovering
over
this
pure
face
she
was
on
the
point
of
encouraging
esperance
to
refuse
the
union
which
would
no
doubt
be
proposed
for
her
but
the
recollection
of
the
duke
haunted
her
was
not
this
man
more
to
be
feared
than
death
itself
these
are
silly
notions
that
crowd
your
brain
with
presentiments
and
nightmares
you
must
rouse
your
energy
my
darling
and
chase
everything
that
threatens
to
hurt
your
life
i
swear
to
you
genevieve
that
i
make
superhuman
efforts
but
no
one
is
master
of
his
thoughts
they
are
so
impulsive
and
rapid
that
they
seem
to
escape
the
control
of
the
will
nevertheless
we
can
deprive
them
of
power
alas
but
i
do
not
want
to
sadden
you
look
maurice
is
getting
anxious
ah
you
are
going
to
be
really
happy
you
are
i
feel
it
true
happiness
is
always
found
where
love
is
equal
maurice
could
not
resist
crying
out
at
sight
of
the
two
girls
how
grave
you
both
look
what
were
you
talking
about
that
you
should
spoil
your
beauty
with
furrows
the
count
looked
straight
at
esperance
and
she
could
not
prevent
herself
from
blushing
my
god
have
pity
on
me
she
thought
help
me
to
love
this
man
after
fifteen
days
of
long
walks
which
grew
longer
every
day
and
constant
care
albert
became
completely
cured
they
had
a
party
at
the
farm
house
to
celebrate
his
recovery
with
the
garrison
doctor
for
the
only
outside
guest
the
portrait
of
the
count
that
maurice
had
done
proved
to
be
quite
a
remarkable
picture
and
natural
it
was
placed
on
the
in
mme
styvens
room
where
she
found
it
when
she
returned
after
lunch
it
was
accompanied
by
a
very
simple
letter
but
a
very
sincere
one
recalling
the
courage
of
the
young
count
and
nobly
expressing
the
gratitude
of
all
it
was
written
and
signed
by
the
philosopher
mme
darbois
and
maurice
the
beautiful
portrait
so
delicately
presented
was
a
source
of
happy
comfort
to
this
lonely
woman
the
next
day
the
countess
had
a
long
talk
with
her
son
he
was
sitting
at
her
feet
reflect
very
carefully
she
said
to
him
reflect
very
carefully
i
believe
that
that
child
whom
i
love
whom
i
find
absolutely
charming
will
not
willingly
renounce
her
art
however
i
am
ready
to
do
all
i
can
to
persuade
her
to
accede
to
our
desire
and
leave
a
career
which
would
be
an
endless
source
of
worry
and
suffering
for
you
my
dear
son
mama
do
not
trouble
her
too
much
she
is
honest
and
loyal
and
i
have
nothing
to
fear
for
the
honour
of
my
name
and
before
his
mother
could
speak
he
went
on
i
am
jealous
it
is
true
but
what
happiness
is
not
willing
to
pay
for
itself
with
a
little
pain
then
perhaps
she
will
understand
i
love
her
so
much
dear
dear
mother
she
took
the
head
of
the
dearly
loved
son
in
her
hands
and
looking
deep
in
his
eyes
said
fervently
dear
god
may
happiness
reward
so
great
a
love
the
young
count
returned
with
his
mother
to
the
farm
where
françois
darbois
and
his
wife
waited
for
them
by
agreement
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
conversation
esperance
was
asked
to
come
to
her
parents
she
was
in
her
room
her
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
break
she
had
been
warned
by
maurice
of
her
family
interview
with
the
countess
genevieve
was
with
her
extolling
the
advantages
of
such
a
union
at
the
same
time
exalting
the
real
goodness
of
the
count
think
also
of
your
father
who
at
last
will
be
able
to
realize
his
dream
of
becoming
a
member
of
the
academy
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
has
every
chance
of
being
elected
but
he
will
never
present
himself
as
long
as
you
are
on
the
stage
you
know
the
straightlaced
ways
of
that
assembly
but
most
of
them
are
poets
and
dramatic
writers
replied
esperance
why
should
my
father
care
to
belong
to
the
academy
at
all
as
genevieve
rebuked
her
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
you
see
genevieve
i
am
becoming
ungrateful
my
nature
that
i
believed
so
frank
and
straightforward
seems
to
get
tangled
in
unexpected
twists
trying
to
go
the
right
way
yes
yes
you
are
right
i
must
save
myself
from
myself
just
then
the
maid
came
into
the
room
monsieur
wants
to
see
mademoiselle
madame
and
countess
styvens
are
with
him
very
well
say
i
will
come
immediately
esperance
threw
her
arms
around
her
friend
neck
if
you
could
only
know
how
i
thank
you
she
went
to
obey
the
summons
of
her
parents
resolved
and
comforted
by
her
friend
words
her
father
gave
her
in
a
few
words
the
message
she
went
forward
very
much
agitated
her
lips
trembling
her
voice
uncertain
madame
i
thank
god
for
giving
me
another
mother
who
is
so
good
so
lovable
the
countess
drew
her
to
her
and
held
her
in
a
long
embrace
the
saintly
woman
was
praying
that
happiness
should
descend
on
this
little
creature
who
was
to
be
her
daughter
maurice
the
baron
jean
mlle
frahender
and
genevieve
were
all
during
this
interview
walking
nervously
in
different
directions
about
the
farm
albert
was
in
his
mother
room
sitting
down
his
head
in
his
hands
awaiting
the
decision
which
was
to
settle
the
joy
or
sorrow
of
his
life
maurice
entered
suddenly
come
on
cousin
he
said
they
are
waiting
for
you
the
young
man
sprang
to
his
full
height
with
complete
command
of
his
nerves
ah
maurice
maurice
he
threw
his
arms
about
the
young
man
and
was
off
on
a
run
for
the
farm
he
entered
like
one
distraught
bent
over
his
mother
hands
and
covering
them
with
kisses
murmuring
phrases
esperance
was
beside
the
countess
he
stood
an
instant
in
silence
before
her
looking
at
her
questioningly
blushing
and
embarrassed
the
young
girl
held
out
her
hands
to
him
and
replied
low
to
the
question
in
his
eyes
yes
then
he
bent
over
her
hand
and
his
lips
murmured
i
thank
you
esperance
oh
i
thank
you
they
all
pressed
the
hands
of
the
two
fiancés
mlle
frahender
and
genevieve
kissed
esperance
tenderly
the
baron
thundered
in
his
military
voice
there
has
been
no
battle
and
yet
here
is
the
breath
of
victory
that
is
very
good
but
a
little
stifling
let
us
have
some
air
the
good
man
had
expressed
the
general
sentiment
the
darbois
mlle
frahender
and
jean
were
sitting
in
the
shade
of
a
little
thicket
of
low
pines
and
other
trees
with
foliage
green
like
water
climbing
flowers
interlaced
in
the
branches
making
flecks
of
pink
and
white
and
violet
it
was
an
ideal
refuge
from
the
heat
and
the
wind
maurice
and
genevieve
walked
on
ahead
esperance
and
albert
sat
down
on
the
high
point
of
rock
that
dominated
the
little
landscape
for
an
instant
they
looked
quietly
without
speaking
albert
broke
this
restless
silence
and
said
as
he
took
hand
i
love
you
esperance
and
i
will
do
all
that
is
in
my
power
or
beyond
it
to
make
you
happy
i
believe
you
albert
and
i
hope
to
be
worthy
of
so
devoted
a
love
he
looked
at
her
very
penetratingly
i
know
that
you
are
not
yet
in
love
with
me
i
do
not
know
just
how
i
love
you
my
dear
but
i
should
always
have
turned
to
you
if
i
had
been
in
trouble
have
you
never
been
in
love
no
i
have
been
and
am
deeply
touched
by
jean
perliez
devotion
but
i
have
never
thought
of
the
possibility
of
being
happy
with
him
and
the
other
asked
albert
looking
straight
at
her
with
his
clear
eyes
she
did
not
answer
at
once
the
duke
yes
the
duke
i
do
not
love
him
she
answered
frightened
at
moments
i
even
hate
him
and
and
insisted
the
young
man
pressing
the
hand
he
was
still
holding
i
am
happy
to
be
your
fiancée
her
voice
vibrated
her
eyes
were
tender
with
gratitude
during
the
dinner
countess
styvens
announced
that
she
must
go
next
day
i
will
take
my
mother
to
brussels
said
albert
and
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
return
immediately
the
dinner
was
very
gay
for
they
were
all
happy
esperance
herself
so
restless
so
disturbed
only
that
morning
talked
animatedly
keeping
them
all
delighted
with
her
grace
and
indefinable
charm
genevieve
was
astonished
doubting
for
a
little
while
whether
she
was
simply
purposely
creating
a
false
excitement
but
no
she
was
really
happy
baron
van
berger
rose
for
a
little
toast
dear
friend
he
said
bowing
to
the
countess
i
am
delighted
to
see
that
you
are
reinforcing
the
ranks
and
enlisting
the
younger
class
this
reinforcement
will
bring
you
light
the
joy
of
its
twenty
years
i
drink
to
your
sun
of
austerlitz
then
turning
towards
albert
i
drink
to
the
line
of
little
soldiers
that
you
will
give
to
belgium
my
boy
the
count
became
scarlet
esperance
dropped
her
eyes
maurice
could
hardly
restrain
his
desire
to
laugh
do
not
forget
that
life
is
a
battle
continued
the
general
do
not
shut
yourself
up
in
your
happiness
but
be
always
on
your
guard
i
drink
to
you
lady
esperance
who
bear
a
name
of
hope
for
the
future
for
you
will
certainly
understand
that
the
most
beautiful
role
to
play
is
that
of
wife
and
mother
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
theatrical
fictions
esperance
rose
but
albert
restrained
her
looking
at
his
mother
the
charming
woman
said
tactfully
my
good
friend
i
think
that
you
have
spoken
according
to
your
own
convictions
esperance
will
conduct
herself
always
as
seems
best
to
her
how
kind
you
are
madame
and
the
young
girl
went
and
kissed
her
hand
this
little
incident
had
interfered
with
the
quiet
of
the
evening
but
esperance
resumed
her
serenity
as
she
understood
that
her
future
had
quite
recognized
the
possibility
that
she
might
remain
faithful
to
her
art
as
to
maurice
the
baron
had
put
him
in
such
spirits
that
he
was
sparkling
with
wit
and
the
dinner
ended
in
the
most
delightful
camaraderie
and
good
feeling
esperance
before
they
had
time
to
ask
her
went
gaily
to
the
piano
albert
sat
down
beside
her
and
begged
that
she
would
sing
she
agreed
sweetly
on
condition
that
her
fiancée
should
accompany
her
her
voice
was
very
pure
and
clear
and
she
sang
a
simple
ballad
with
exquisite
taste
you
have
no
middle
voice
objected
the
baron
quite
true
agreed
esperance
with
a
silvery
laugh
you
are
terribly
frank
when
the
girls
were
alone
together
finally
genevieve
complimented
her
friend
upon
all
that
had
happened
you
were
adorably
gracious
dear
little
countess
and
i
believe
in
your
happiness
no
genevieve
said
esperance
i
shall
not
be
happy
i
know
it
except
in
so
far
as
i
can
give
happiness
i
love
countess
styvens
very
deeply
i
am
touched
by
albert
love
i
see
that
i
shall
be
forced
by
loyalty
to
renounce
the
theatre
i
shall
be
torn
by
regret
for
i
fear
my
life
will
be
spoiled
and
i
am
not
yet
twenty
she
was
sitting
on
her
bed
looking
so
forlorn
that
genevieve
slipped
down
beside
her
and
drew
the
little
blonde
head
to
her
shoulder
you
dear
asked
esperance
will
you
renounce
the
theatre
if
maurice
tells
you
that
he
wishes
it
i
shall
not
even
wait
for
him
to
tell
me
if
maurice
wishes
me
to
be
his
companion
through
life
i
will
sacrifice
everything
for
him
with
only
one
regret
that
i
have
not
enough
to
give
up
for
him
oh
said
esperance
miserably
you
are
in
love
but
i
am
not
and
the
unhappy
child
stifling
her
sobs
hid
her
head
in
the
pillow
two
days
later
the
countess
her
son
and
the
baron
left
for
brussels
madame
styvens
had
questioned
esperance
very
adroitly
and
she
left
penhouet
with
a
pretty
good
idea
of
her
tastes
and
preferences
it
was
then
the
end
of
august
and
the
banns
were
to
be
published
for
november
the
baron
was
to
arrange
for
the
marriage
in
brussels
but
it
was
agreed
that
the
young
couple
should
live
in
paris
and
the
countess
proposed
to
pick
out
a
pretty
house
to
shelter
the
happiness
of
her
son
she
herself
would
live
in
paris
but
she
refused
to
share
their
home
i
shall
look
for
a
house
or
an
apartment
near
by
the
adieux
were
tender
on
both
sides
esperance
was
so
sensitive
to
the
charm
of
her
that
it
made
her
seem
devoted
to
her
fiancée
chapter
xxi
the
news
of
the
engagement
of
esperance
and
the
count
styvens
was
known
all
over
paris
letters
came
to
the
farm
of
penhouet
done
up
in
packets
many
expressed
to
the
philosopher
and
his
wife
their
joy
at
hearing
that
their
daughter
had
decided
to
leave
a
career
so
so
very
in
which
in
fact
that
every
absurd
prejudice
so
puritanly
ingrained
in
the
minds
of
most
middle
class
divisions
and
sections
and
even
amongst
the
more
cultivated
was
endlessly
repeated
upon
with
the
usual
banalities
in
the
large
correspondence
of
their
friends
and
others
poor
actors
so
misunderstood
so
misrepresented
the
philosopher
showed
all
the
letters
to
esperance
who
shrugged
her
shoulders
astonished
to
find
there
was
so
much
prejudice
in
the
world
against
her
beloved
calling
one
letter
however
she
took
quite
seriously
it
was
written
by
the
most
eminent
of
all
the
academicians
one
sentence
in
the
epistle
wounded
the
poor
child
very
deeply
now
i
shall
be
able
to
go
about
your
election
with
more
confidence
and
security
dare
i
admit
to
you
my
dear
professor
that
the
only
obstacle
i
encountered
and
which
seemed
to
me
insurmountable
was
the
career
chosen
by
that
lovely
child
your
daughter
whose
talent
we
all
admire
so
much
now
i
can
start
my
campaign
and
i
am
very
sure
my
dear
darbois
of
achieving
our
ambition
without
much
difficulty
therefore
perhaps
i
shall
not
altogether
deserve
your
thanks
what
genevieve
had
said
was
patently
true
her
father
had
sacrificed
his
dearest
hope
for
her
and
he
had
done
it
so
all
unostentatiously
ah
how
she
loved
her
father
who
was
unlike
other
men
he
was
standing
there
before
her
smiling
a
little
scornful
of
all
these
little
souls
and
as
he
handed
her
another
letter
no
father
dear
no
i
beg
you
pardon
me
the
wrong
that
i
have
been
doing
you
i
admire
you
and
i
love
you
dear
papa
but
leave
me
with
the
noble
feeling
of
your
supreme
kindness
i
would
rather
not
know
any
more
of
the
little
meannesses
of
the
world
she
climbed
on
her
father
knees
and
covered
his
forehead
with
kisses
look
said
mme
darbois
holding
up
a
letter
eight
pages
from
your
godfather
esperance
jumped
up
laughing
that
i
certainly
shall
not
read
i
am
going
to
write
to
the
countess
that
i
give
up
my
art
and
swift
as
a
shadow
she
was
gone
the
philosopher
sat
hesitating
his
expression
troubled
had
he
the
right
to
compel
this
sacrifice
knowing
realizing
as
he
did
that
his
child
had
based
all
the
happiness
of
her
life
on
the
career
she
was
now
voluntarily
giving
up
for
his
sake
germaine
looked
at
him
questioningly
do
you
believe
my
dear
that
i
ought
to
let
esperance
write
to
the
countess
as
she
proposes
i
fear
that
she
is
making
this
sacrifice
to
gratify
my
vanity
françois
exclaimed
mme
darbois
indignantly
my
pride
if
you
prefer
it
he
said
but
what
is
such
a
satisfaction
in
comparison
with
the
happiness
of
a
life
to
me
it
seems
very
unjust
germaine
adored
her
husband
and
her
daughter
but
she
believed
more
than
in
anything
in
the
world
in
the
noble
genius
of
the
philosopher
esperance
sacrifice
she
said
is
very
slight
she
is
making
a
superb
marriage
into
one
of
the
noblest
richest
families
in
belgium
albert
worships
the
ground
she
walks
on
the
countess
will
be
more
than
indulgent
to
her
she
is
realizing
the
most
perfect
future
a
young
girl
can
hope
for
i
see
nothing
to
regret
because
she
is
making
a
slight
concession
to
her
father
françois
looked
a
little
sadly
at
this
mother
who
had
never
comprehended
her
daughter
psychology
he
knew
that
for
this
sweet
woman
the
happiness
of
life
began
with
her
husband
and
ended
with
him
he
did
not
want
to
argue
and
rose
saying
i
must
do
some
work
ho
kissed
the
unlined
forehead
of
his
beloved
wife
and
then
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
added
tell
esperance
i
should
like
to
see
her
letter
before
she
sends
it
esperance
sat
at
her
desk
in
her
own
room
but
she
sat
with
her
head
in
her
hands
unable
to
begin
her
letter
presently
genevieve
came
in
is
anything
the
matter
dear
esperance
told
her
what
had
just
happened
downstairs
i
have
learned
once
more
that
all
your
reasonings
and
counsels
are
always
wise
dear
sister
i
am
sitting
trying
how
to
write
to
the
countess
to
tell
her
that
i
am
not
going
back
to
the
stage
genevieve
kissed
her
esperance
let
her
head
fall
on
her
bosom
and
raising
her
eyes
to
her
face
said
slowly
but
oh
i
have
not
the
courage
genevieve
knelt
beside
the
desk
and
dipping
the
pen
in
the
ink
put
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
before
esperance
saying
with
a
laugh
get
on
with
your
task
i
am
the
school
mistress
to
see
that
you
write
properly
the
smile
she
brought
to
esperance
lips
chased
away
the
nebulous
uncertainties
and
so
she
wrote
her
letter
to
her
dear
little
as
she
had
called
her
since
her
engagement
when
her
mother
came
with
the
philosopher
message
and
saw
the
letter
she
was
delighted
with
the
phrasing
and
thanked
her
daughter
warmly
for
the
joy
it
would
give
her
father
ah
mama
i
believe
that
i
am
the
happiest
of
the
three
darbois
dear
ridiculous
mama
and
she
gave
her
a
quick
embrace
life
was
again
travelling
the
simple
daily
country
round
it
was
after
lunch
three
days
after
esperance
had
written
her
letter
why
so
pensive
little
daughter
where
were
your
thoughts
esperance
jumped
up
at
this
question
from
her
father
i
was
dreaming
i
am
so
sorry
i
was
in
belgium
near
the
countess
styvens
when
my
letter
would
be
brought
in
to
her
for
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
it
ought
to
arrive
no
said
darbois
that
letter
has
not
been
delivered
it
is
still
in
my
desk
their
faces
expressed
the
great
astonishment
that
they
felt
you
did
not
like
it
papa
very
much
very
much
it
is
quite
good
and
and
pathetic
then
darling
papa
i
want
to
talk
with
you
a
little
more
before
you
send
it
everyone
drank
their
coffee
a
little
quicker
and
five
minutes
later
françois
found
himself
alone
with
his
daughter
even
mme
darbois
had
withdrawn
afraid
that
she
might
show
her
own
anxiety
too
much
i
am
listening
to
you
papa
you
are
going
to
answer
my
questions
with
perfect
frankness
esperance
yes
father
had
you
thought
of
writing
to
countess
styvens
before
you
read
that
letter
he
drew
the
academician
letter
from
his
portfolio
and
placed
it
before
her
no
father
dear
then
it
was
on
my
account
and
to
facilitate
my
admittance
to
the
academy
that
you
wrote
oh
no
replied
esperance
quickly
i
would
not
do
you
that
injustice
knowing
how
much
you
love
me
and
knowing
the
purity
of
your
heart
the
nobility
of
your
ambition
i
am
sacrificing
what
i
believe
perhaps
wrongly
to
be
my
happiness
to
the
demands
of
a
misunderstanding
world
i
knew
when
i
read
that
letter
that
i
had
no
right
to
drag
a
man
of
your
merit
my
dear
mother
and
all
the
family
into
the
troubles
of
a
life
in
which
they
have
no
real
interest
i
did
not
want
you
to
have
the
sympathy
of
the
world
sympathy
is
too
often
akin
to
scorn
françois
would
have
spoken
but
esperance
interrupted
him
oh
father
darling
you
are
so
good
do
torment
me
further
send
the
letter
i
am
still
so
new
to
this
role
i
need
your
sincere
your
constant
help
just
then
marguerite
came
in
and
handed
the
philosopher
a
letter
bearing
an
armorial
seal
which
had
just
come
from
palais
he
quickly
opened
it
seemed
surprised
and
passed
it
to
his
daughter
what
the
duchess
de
is
at
palais
she
said
then
she
read
my
dear
philosopher
the
princess
and
i
will
come
if
agreeable
to
you
after
five
i
name
this
hour
because
the
yacht
has
to
leave
to
take
up
friends
who
are
waiting
for
us
at
brehat
what
time
is
it
said
esperance
turning
round
the
professor
consulted
his
watch
twenty
minutes
past
three
quick
marguerite
tell
the
men
to
harness
the
victoria
with
the
two
horses
at
once
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
carriage
was
ready
to
leave
when
it
had
disappeared
round
the
corner
from
the
farm
genevieve
and
her
friend
prepared
to
go
for
a
walk
esperance
told
her
mother
and
mlle
frahender
that
they
would
be
back
again
in
half
an
hour
they
climbed
down
the
cliff
and
were
soon
out
of
earshot
of
everyone
they
were
quite
alone
genevieve
genevieve
said
esperance
i
feel
that
a
new
danger
is
threatening
me
ready
to
destroy
all
my
new
illusions
do
not
leave
me
darling
what
is
it
that
you
fear
i
can
only
be
sure
of
one
thing
i
am
in
such
horrible
distress
and
that
is
that
the
duke
de
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
visit
ah
if
i
could
be
sure
that
i
should
never
see
him
again
never
never
and
she
cried
in
her
great
distress
like
a
little
child
genevieve
stayed
at
her
side
without
saying
a
word
only
stroking
her
hands
from
time
to
time
presently
esperance
grew
calmer
come
she
said
rising
from
the
boulder
on
which
they
had
seated
themselves
we
must
dress
to
receive
the
enemy
emissaries
her
voice
was
light
but
her
heart
was
heavy
maurice
who
had
been
strolling
not
far
off
with
jean
came
up
and
noticing
esperance
tearful
eyes
said
what
is
the
matter
i
dread
this
visit
exclaimed
esperance
what
is
the
reason
of
this
sudden
call
ejaculated
maurice
i
think
i
can
guess
said
the
actor
well
tell
me
but
if
i
should
be
wrong
said
jean
what
a
frightful
lot
of
circumlocution
cried
maurice
impatiently
pretending
to
tear
out
his
hair
but
esperance
replied
no
jean
you
are
not
mistaken
i
can
guess
your
thoughts
i
am
afraid
as
i
just
now
said
to
genevieve
that
the
duke
de
is
connected
in
some
way
with
this
visit
of
the
princess
and
her
friend
if
the
duke
comes
here
but
i
do
not
believe
he
will
jean
and
i
will
not
leave
him
alone
a
minute
i
assure
you
that
he
will
get
more
of
our
company
than
he
will
appreciate
but
knowing
that
the
count
is
not
here
i
do
not
think
he
will
come
he
is
too
correct
for
that
come
let
us
dance
in
honour
of
albert
taking
his
cousin
hands
and
genevieve
he
nodded
his
head
to
jean
to
do
the
same
thing
and
led
them
into
a
whirlwind
dance
upon
the
sands
of
the
beach
until
the
girls
laughed
as
though
no
heavy
thoughts
were
weighing
in
their
hearts
two
hours
later
the
victoria
arrived
from
palais
the
young
people
could
see
that
it
contained
only
two
ladies
and
the
philosopher
and
genevieve
breathed
again
the
princess
descended
lightly
before
the
front
door
she
kissed
esperance
and
after
speaking
to
mme
darbois
had
maurice
jean
and
genevieve
presented
to
her
you
did
the
portrait
of
which
the
duke
de
morlay
has
spoken
so
highly
maurice
bowed
would
it
be
impertinence
if
i
asked
you
to
let
me
see
it
she
said
with
a
smile
i
thank
you
madame
you
flatter
me
by
your
request
the
dowager
duchess
with
whom
the
princess
had
been
spending
three
weeks
at
her
château
of
was
now
presented
to
mme
darbois
she
was
a
lovable
and
delightful
old
lady
with
a
great
appreciation
of
art
and
science
both
ladies
had
been
present
with
the
duke
at
the
last
conservatoire
competition
and
they
expressed
to
esperance
genevieve
and
jean
the
enjoyment
their
performances
had
given
them
the
duchess
was
much
struck
by
genevieve
proud
beauty
and
said
to
maurice
ah
monsieur
what
another
beautiful
portrait
you
could
make
this
young
lady
is
much
more
beautiful
close
to
than
even
on
the
stage
and
she
added
a
kind
and
appreciative
word
for
the
classic
talent
of
jean
perliez
tea
was
to
be
served
in
the
little
beautiful
convolvulus
garden
when
they
entered
this
shelter
which
a
poet
might
have
designed
the
duchess
exclaimed
enviously
what
a
heavenly
spot
who
is
the
inspired
person
who
has
arranged
this
mysterious
flowery
retreat
for
you
the
philosopher
pointed
to
maurice
and
the
girls
the
princess
admired
it
and
the
conversation
rippled
on
we
are
come
to
trouble
your
bower
with
a
plea
for
charity
every
year
the
duchess
gives
a
garden
party
in
her
beautiful
park
at
montjoie
for
the
benefit
of
the
of
the
fishermen
there
is
a
little
theatre
where
some
of
the
greatest
actors
have
appeared
little
rustic
booths
shops
where
you
pay
a
great
deal
for
nothing
at
all
and
a
thousand
other
distractions
we
are
come
the
duchess
and
i
drawn
by
a
very
pretty
star
esperance
she
will
not
deny
us
her
light
our
lovely
little
star
she
concluded
bending
towards
esperance
but
madame
murmured
esperance
my
decision
my
promises
do
not
depend
on
myself
alone
now
the
duchess
extracted
a
letter
from
her
gold
mesh
bag
and
held
it
towards
her
you
are
perfectly
right
my
dear
child
she
said
easily
i
also
foresaw
that
objection
so
i
wrote
to
your
fiancé
even
before
speaking
to
you
for
which
i
must
apologize
and
here
is
his
answer
esperance
read
the
little
missive
bearing
the
styvens
arms
and
handed
it
back
to
the
duchess
i
will
not
be
she
said
smiling
sadly
more
royalist
than
the
king
madame
i
am
at
the
service
of
your
work
this
was
a
great
delight
to
the
two
kindly
disposed
women
but
the
young
girl
heart
was
torn
because
her
fiancé
would
not
see
it
is
true
that
his
letter
ended
with
the
words
i
agree
with
both
hands
to
whatever
esperance
shall
decide
so
that
little
choice
was
left
the
garden
party
was
to
be
the
twentieth
of
september
it
was
then
the
end
of
august
and
of
what
nature
is
to
be
the
modest
contribution
i
can
make
to
your
fête
asked
esperance
half
humorously
modest
of
course
you
will
be
the
principal
attraction
my
guests
knowing
that
they
will
see
you
for
the
last
time
before
count
styvens
carries
his
little
idol
away
from
the
public
esperance
was
saying
to
herself
so
this
cultivated
lady
thinks
just
as
the
others
do
the
princess
continued
we
want
you
to
play
with
your
fiancé
the
liszt
symphonic
poem
that
you
played
one
evening
at
the
legation
and
to
take
part
in
some
tableaux
vivants
that
we
are
all
to
appear
in
the
duke
de
is
directing
and
staging
this
part
of
the
programme
the
performance
will
be
given
only
by
people
we
know
no
professionals
the
princess
had
spoken
quite
quickly
without
reflection
she
blushed
slightly
when
she
remembered
esperance
and
jean
perliez
but
she
had
made
the
mistake
and
there
was
no
way
of
calling
it
back
she
thought
that
esperance
belonged
to
that
circle
where
a
compliment
effaces
what
might
seem
like
an
impertinence
at
first
the
name
of
the
duke
de
morlay
had
fallen
like
a
pebble
in
the
stream
and
began
to
ripple
the
waters
a
spreading
circle
of
thoughts
fears
resentments
began
to
move
in
every
heart
the
philosopher
himself
was
troubled
for
he
had
been
prompted
by
maurice
to
observe
the
assiduous
attractions
of
the
duke
and
the
agitation
he
caused
esperance
whenever
they
had
been
together
esperance
and
genevieve
both
grew
pale
the
young
painter
raised
his
head
ready
for
some
sort
of
a
return
reply
without
hesitation
he
had
decided
on
the
plan
to
follow
he
must
not
only
be
invited
to
the
fête
which
would
be
easy
enough
he
must
take
part
in
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
shadow
and
watch
the
manoeuvres
of
the
over
agreeable
duke
if
you
will
allow
me
madame
he
said
boldly
i
should
like
to
contribute
my
mite
to
your
fête
by
painting
the
scenery
the
princess
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
at
the
suggestion
and
this
new
support
how
pleased
my
cousin
de
morlay
will
be
she
exclaimed
he
has
just
been
saying
to
me
the
scenery
we
shall
require
a
painter
a
real
artist
a
professional
said
maurice
bowing
ironically
the
princess
was
somewhat
provoked
but
she
appeared
not
to
notice
the
rather
pointed
remark
you
might
also
design
the
costumes
for
the
tableaux
vivants
she
continued
my
cousin
exclaimed
esperance
has
a
great
gift
for
arrangement
and
composition
you
will
be
able
to
judge
for
yourself
soon
i
will
show
you
how
beautifully
he
has
painted
my
portrait
true
may
we
see
it
now
this
made
a
welcome
change
for
the
four
young
people
they
all
went
towards
the
five
divisions
of
the
world
the
duchess
stopped
every
now
and
then
on
the
way
to
admire
the
sea
and
the
luminous
quality
of
the
air
she
was
really
amazed
when
she
was
shown
the
picture
it
had
been
installed
in
the
little
court
under
a
kind
of
alcove
that
maurice
had
made
for
it
he
had
found
in
his
aunt
reliquary
some
pretty
hangings
which
hid
the
alcove
and
the
picture
lost
nothing
by
the
arrangement
of
drapery
you
have
indeed
a
beautiful
portrait
there
said
the
princess
sincerely
every
year
for
his
birthday
i
give
my
husband
some
work
of
art
if
you
do
not
find
me
too
unworthy
a
subject
it
shall
be
signed
this
year
renaud
the
young
man
bowed
i
shall
be
very
happy
indeed
madame
and
very
highly
honoured
then
as
our
friend
and
collaborator
said
the
duchess
you
must
i
think
come
with
us
at
once
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
to
work
with
the
duke
without
delay
give
me
time
to
pack
by
bag
madame
returned
the
triumphant
maurice
and
i
will
join
you
at
the
carriage
i
will
come
and
help
with
your
packing
cousin
you
will
excuse
me
she
added
turning
to
the
princess
and
esperance
followed
by
genevieve
and
jean
perliez
disappeared
together
as
soon
as
she
was
sure
she
was
out
of
esperance
threw
her
arms
about
her
cousin
neck
you
were
simply
wonderful
yes
joined
in
maurice
the
enemy
has
fallen
into
the
ambush
as
baron
van
berger
would
say
i
will
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
must
take
time
to
rout
our
amiable
duke
he
is
the
real
enemy
and
the
most
difficult
opponent
but
i
am
confident
with
my
most
diabolical
scheming
little
cousin
i
am
going
to
have
great
fun
all
the
same
i
foresee
that
i
be
able
to
stay
away
long
and
he
kissed
genevieve
hand
tenderly
they
soon
finished
the
packing
and
jean
closed
the
suitcase
and
the
young
people
arrived
at
the
carriage
just
as
it
drew
up
how
very
good
it
is
of
you
to
accept
this
sudden
demand
upon
your
services
with
such
good
grace
i
must
remind
you
madame
that
i
suggested
the
work
myself
and
i
am
glad
to
do
it
i
am
also
quite
happy
to
be
carried
off
by
you
as
it
is
such
an
pleasure
two
days
later
the
professor
had
a
letter
from
maurice
which
he
read
aloud
to
the
family
as
they
drank
their
coffee
my
dear
uncle
this
letter
is
to
be
shared
by
the
whole
community
i
have
found
a
world
gone
mad
in
this
magnificent
château
we
are
at
table
i
have
been
cordially
welcomed
by
all
the
strangers
to
whom
this
cursed
duke
delightful
fellow
has
graciously
presented
me
i
set
to
work
at
once
to
unravel
and
discover
the
plans
of
charles
de
morlay
but
more
anon
this
is
the
programme
an
orchestra
composed
of
excellent
artists
are
to
play
while
the
guests
arrive
inspect
each
other
and
take
their
places
we
begin
with
a
little
ballet
entitled
moon
in
search
of
acted
and
danced
by
some
very
good
amateurs
i
am
to
paint
the
drop
for
this
ballet
and
the
authors
it
has
taken
three
of
them
to
elaborate
the
stupidest
scenario
you
ever
yawned
through
have
called
for
a
scandinavian
design
and
i
have
promised
it
and
shall
paint
it
at
penhouet
then
the
great
attraction
the
tableaux
vivants
that
is
where
i
lay
in
wait
for
our
astute
duke
i
will
spare
you
details
of
nine
of
the
tableaux
there
are
to
be
twelve
but
esperance
appears
only
in
three
which
are
the
best
in
one
she
represents
andromeda
fastened
to
the
rock
and
perseus
the
duke
delivers
her
after
overcoming
the
dragon
in
the
second
the
of
paris
she
appears
as
aphrodite
to
whom
paris
the
duke
gives
the
apple
the
third
is
and
the
bull
europa
being
personified
by
esperance
the
duke
does
not
wish
to
look
ridiculous
in
a
bull
hide
so
takes
liberties
with
the
legend
and
transforms
the
bull
into
a
centaur
i
have
said
to
everything
finally
to
complete
the
fête
which
will
no
doubt
be
well
attended
and
very
profitable
there
will
be
little
shops
of
all
kinds
esperance
is
to
sell
flowers
from
the
duchess
gardens
i
have
my
own
idea
on
this
point
which
i
shall
later
confide
to
you
i
can
easily
get
her
fiancé
to
agree
your
nephew
dear
uncle
should
live
in
the
land
of
honey
for
the
future
i
have
already
had
orders
for
three
portraits
and
of
three
pretty
women
which
assures
me
that
the
portraits
will
be
successful
ahem
i
am
taking
all
my
notes
and
will
be
with
you
the
day
after
it
is
up
to
you
dear
uncle
to
distribute
in
unequal
or
suitable
doses
my
respects
and
love
and
affection
amongst
all
those
anxious
to
receive
such
privileges
your
affectionately
devoted
maurice
it
seems
to
me
said
genevieve
as
she
left
the
with
esperance
that
your
cousin
has
arranged
everything
very
well
and
that
you
ought
to
be
quite
happy
and
content
oh
i
know
very
well
that
i
shall
be
taken
care
of
but
how
can
i
struggle
against
the
tumultuous
ideas
that
assail
me
the
vision
of
the
duke
has
haunted
me
ever
since
maurice
left
i
have
never
seen
the
château
but
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
recognize
it
i
would
like
to
fall
ill
with
some
complaint
that
would
send
me
to
sleep
and
sleep
oh
if
i
could
get
a
little
ugly
for
a
little
while
just
long
enough
to
make
the
duke
lose
interest
in
me
i
should
be
so
glad
dear
genevieve
ca
you
give
me
a
little
dose
of
the
elixir
of
your
happiness
i
need
it
sorely
just
now
the
girls
had
been
walking
as
they
talked
down
to
the
little
beach
at
penhouet
the
sea
was
at
low
tide
and
the
golden
sand
dried
by
the
sun
offered
them
a
restful
couch
they
stretched
themselves
out
upon
it
and
esperance
soon
fell
asleep
jean
perliez
appeared
on
the
crest
of
the
little
hill
that
hides
the
bay
from
the
sightseeker
genevieve
signed
to
him
to
come
down
quietly
he
had
a
telegram
a
dispatch
from
belgium
he
pinned
it
to
esperance
hat
lying
on
the
sand
at
her
side
and
dropping
down
close
to
genevieve
began
to
talk
in
low
tones
for
both
he
and
genevieve
were
uneasy
concerning
their
little
friend
a
farm
dog
at
the
moment
began
to
bark
furiously
esperance
woke
quickly
looking
pale
and
worried
with
her
hands
pressed
on
her
frightened
heart
she
saw
the
telegram
and
opened
it
quickly
albert
will
be
here
this
evening
by
the
second
boat
what
time
is
it
she
showed
a
little
emotion
but
only
a
little
though
she
felt
deeply
she
looked
towards
the
sun
it
ca
be
four
yet
jean
took
out
his
watch
twenty
to
four
he
said
the
boat
ca
get
here
before
quick
quick
run
jean
and
ask
to
have
some
conveyance
got
ready
i
must
go
and
tell
my
father
and
get
his
permission
to
go
with
you
and
genevieve
to
meet
my
fiancée
ah
what
good
luck
she
said
with
a
long
breath
what
good
luck
françois
darbois
was
delighted
for
his
daughter
to
go
and
meet
albert
and
departed
so
radiantly
that
he
said
to
his
wife
i
believe
she
is
getting
to
love
this
brave
albert
genevieve
who
had
heard
as
had
also
jean
said
to
the
young
man
in
a
low
voice
but
my
god
suppose
she
is
beginning
to
love
the
duke
chapter
xxii
the
boat
approached
the
little
quay
of
palais
slowly
with
count
styvens
standing
well
forward
his
tall
figure
silhouetted
against
the
grey
of
the
sea
he
caught
sight
of
esperance
immediately
as
she
stood
up
in
the
brake
waving
her
handkerchief
great
happiness
was
in
his
heart
and
in
his
haste
to
be
ashore
he
went
to
assist
them
to
lay
down
the
gangplank
and
was
at
the
carriage
in
a
second
kissing
most
tenderly
the
hand
esperance
held
out
to
him
a
great
basket
was
placed
on
the
seat
the
girls
blushed
with
pleasure
for
a
sweet
odour
was
wafted
to
them
from
it
all
the
way
home
esperance
heard
from
albert
in
detail
all
that
had
happened
to
him
since
she
had
last
seen
him
she
talked
incessantly
as
if
to
drown
her
thoughts
under
a
sea
of
nonsense
at
the
farm
the
young
man
could
see
the
pleasure
they
all
showed
at
his
return
of
course
he
was
somewhat
astonished
to
learn
that
maurice
was
absent
with
the
duchess
for
he
had
not
yet
heard
of
the
events
that
had
happened
during
his
absence
they
all
gathered
together
in
the
the
count
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
little
case
and
asking
esperance
to
give
him
her
hand
slipped
on
to
her
middle
finger
a
magnificent
engagement
ring
somehow
her
hand
went
cold
as
death
as
albert
held
it
and
her
face
contracted
strangely
do
you
regret
your
word
already
esperance
he
asked
in
a
nervous
low
voice
no
no
albert
she
said
quickly
nervously
twisting
the
ring
on
her
finger
but
this
is
a
very
serious
moment
and
you
know
that
i
incline
to
taking
things
seriously
here
and
she
put
her
hand
across
her
heart
then
she
smiled
pressed
his
hand
and
showed
the
ring
to
genevieve
they
all
examined
and
admired
the
beautiful
jewel
when
the
philosopher
turned
to
praise
it
albert
had
disappeared
the
basket
was
opened
revealing
a
bouquet
of
magnificent
white
orchids
marvellously
fresh
held
in
a
white
scarf
with
embroidered
ends
when
they
assembled
for
dinner
an
hour
later
esperance
was
not
present
and
albert
began
to
look
uneasy
but
they
had
not
long
to
wait
and
when
she
did
appear
she
was
dressed
all
in
white
an
embroidered
scarf
fastened
about
her
waist
and
several
orchids
arranged
like
a
coronet
in
her
hair
at
that
moment
she
seemed
almost
supernaturally
beautiful
what
a
pity
that
maurice
is
not
here
you
are
so
lovely
this
evening
said
genevieve
oh
said
esperance
smiling
that
is
not
the
only
reason
you
regret
his
absence
next
day
they
were
surprised
to
get
no
word
from
the
painter
to
tell
them
which
boat
he
would
take
it
was
warm
and
they
had
coffee
served
in
the
convolvulus
bower
the
breeze
came
through
an
opening
from
the
sea
look
is
that
a
pretty
boat
cried
out
genevieve
a
white
yacht
was
sailing
slowly
towards
penhouet
the
philosopher
got
his
glasses
it
is
the
princess
flag
he
exclaimed
yes
yes
agreed
albert
it
is
the
belgian
flag
listen
there
is
the
salute
jean
ran
to
the
farm
calling
back
i
will
answer
it
all
right
m
darbois
the
flag
sank
and
rose
three
times
then
the
yacht
headed
straight
for
the
little
bay
genevieve
climbed
on
a
high
rock
and
clapped
her
hands
it
is
he
oh
it
is
he
she
turned
radiantly
back
to
the
party
in
the
grove
her
it
is
he
made
albert
smile
it
was
so
charming
so
sincere
that
they
all
shared
the
quality
of
her
joy
it
was
indeed
maurice
returning
on
the
princess
yacht
the
tide
was
so
high
that
the
boat
could
get
quite
close
everyone
went
down
to
the
beach
where
the
waves
were
washing
the
little
rocks
albert
jumped
on
the
largest
rock
which
seemed
to
recede
to
sea
with
him
genevieve
would
have
followed
him
but
he
cried
out
look
out
it
is
very
deep
here
she
stayed
where
she
was
but
so
woebegone
did
her
face
become
that
albert
leapt
ashore
again
and
before
she
knew
what
he
was
doing
picked
her
up
and
was
back
on
the
slippery
rock
with
her
oh
the
bold
lad
said
the
professor
the
little
sloop
had
been
launched
and
maurice
could
easily
land
on
the
big
rock
he
kissed
genevieve
and
told
the
count
of
his
delight
in
seeing
him
again
then
he
looked
around
him
the
water
surrounded
them
on
all
sides
he
looked
at
genevieve
questioningly
but
by
way
of
response
albert
simply
picked
her
up
again
and
went
ashore
with
her
maurice
was
quick
and
agile
he
was
even
strong
in
a
nervous
way
but
albert
strength
and
agility
filled
him
with
wonder
esperance
congratulated
the
count
on
his
prowess
and
his
kind
thought
in
enabling
genevieve
to
see
maurice
a
little
sooner
it
is
because
i
know
what
that
joy
is
myself
he
answered
simply
esperance
eyes
grew
moist
as
she
turned
to
albert
you
are
so
good
you
always
do
the
right
thing
i
am
prouder
every
day
to
be
loved
by
you
during
dinner
maurice
gave
them
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
to
him
with
many
new
incidents
i
am
not
telling
you
anything
new
he
added
to
albert
when
they
were
alone
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
duke
is
in
love
with
esperance
we
all
know
it
here
albert
agreed
with
a
rather
sad
smile
that
he
did
know
it
now
that
my
cousin
is
your
fiancée
he
is
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
seek
her
but
he
certainly
wants
to
be
near
her
to
talk
to
her
in
short
to
flirt
with
her
you
believe
that
he
would
dare
my
dear
cousin
said
maurice
half
jestingly
half
serious
i
believe
him
capable
of
anything
but
he
knows
that
you
are
here
and
perhaps
is
afraid
to
take
liberties
to
put
an
end
to
his
manoeuvrings
we
must
somehow
make
him
look
ridiculous
and
expose
his
folly
the
fête
i
think
will
give
us
our
chance
albert
said
i
will
follow
your
advice
maurice
very
good
i
will
give
you
particulars
of
my
plans
by
the
way
i
have
brought
all
your
invitations
i
will
go
and
deliver
them
so
they
went
to
seek
the
others
and
maurice
gave
each
one
a
card
with
a
personal
invitation
for
the
twentieth
of
september
genevieve
blushed
i
am
invited
as
well
she
said
of
course
and
i
believe
the
amiable
duchess
intends
to
ask
you
to
recite
the
poem
she
has
written
it
is
very
touching
i
will
find
it
for
you
ah
yes
you
have
made
a
great
impression
on
that
delightful
lady
she
talked
about
you
to
me
all
the
time
you
would
have
supposed
she
was
doing
it
to
please
me
genevieve
became
purple
it
was
the
first
time
maurice
had
expressed
himself
so
frankly
when
they
left
the
table
she
led
esperance
aside
and
kissed
her
until
she
almost
stifled
her
oh
how
happy
i
am
and
how
i
love
him
maurice
and
jean
passed
by
talking
so
busily
that
they
did
not
see
the
girls
you
are
sure
absolutely
since
i
have
been
away
for
four
whole
days
i
am
convinced
more
than
ever
that
i
adore
that
girl
and
shall
not
be
happy
without
her
you
have
written
to
your
father
not
yet
i
must
first
of
all
talk
to
genevieve
you
are
not
afraid
of
what
she
will
say
of
her
answer
maurice
smiled
i
want
first
to
tell
her
of
my
future
plans
and
to
have
a
confidential
chat
with
her
about
everything
you
will
be
my
best
man
old
fellow
he
went
on
clapping
jean
on
the
shoulder
you
have
chosen
the
role
of
actor
with
the
temperament
of
a
spectator
strange
lover
like
any
other
man
i
follow
my
destiny
you
were
born
for
happiness
maurice
one
has
only
to
look
at
you
to
be
convinced
of
it
you
breathe
forth
life
you
love
you
conquer
youth
radiates
from
you
i
have
asked
myself
a
hundred
times
why
i
have
chosen
this
career
and
i
am
persuaded
that
i
must
live
if
at
all
the
life
of
others
are
you
very
upset
unhappy
asked
maurice
no
oh
no
i
do
suffer
much
but
of
course
i
am
a
little
disturbed
i
am
like
a
reflection
esperance
happiness
elates
her
sorrow
depresses
me
i
love
her
purely
as
an
idealist
i
would
like
count
albert
to
look
like
the
duke
de
and
still
keep
the
noble
soul
that
we
know
he
possesses
if
your
cousin
should
die
i
truly
believe
that
i
would
die
my
life
would
be
without
aim
without
soul
bereft
of
light
the
reflection
would
vanish
they
walked
slowly
down
to
the
beach
to
join
albert
and
the
girls
the
night
had
broken
soft
and
limpid
full
of
stars
full
of
dreams
they
sat
down
on
the
sand
silently
admiring
the
prospect
the
waves
broke
regularly
as
if
scanning
the
poem
of
silence
a
fresh
scent
rose
from
the
rocks
which
were
clothed
with
sea
moss
far
away
a
dog
was
barking
the
young
people
were
silent
united
in
a
mood
of
wonder
before
the
depths
and
lights
of
the
night
part
iv
the
château
chapter
xxiii
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
the
girls
had
to
tear
themselves
away
from
their
quiet
retreat
at
and
leave
penhouet
and
all
else
to
travel
with
mlle
frahender
jean
and
maurice
to
the
château
de
montjoie
when
they
arrived
there
at
ten
in
the
evening
esperance
recognised
the
duke
in
the
distance
as
soon
as
the
carriage
stopped
he
was
looking
out
of
one
of
the
great
windows
above
the
terrace
he
was
in
fact
awaiting
the
coming
of
esperance
but
he
pretended
not
to
have
seen
the
carriage
and
continued
to
gaze
up
at
the
stars
esperance
trembled
and
her
lips
were
icy
cold
albert
had
also
seen
the
duke
and
was
not
deceived
by
his
attitude
he
had
resolved
to
be
calm
but
a
sullen
unbidden
anger
arose
within
him
when
the
housekeeper
had
installed
the
two
girls
in
a
tower
of
the
château
she
left
with
them
a
little
breton
peasant
girl
she
will
be
devoted
to
your
service
she
said
her
name
is
jeanette
her
room
is
above
yours
and
when
you
ring
this
bell
she
will
wait
upon
you
at
once
esperance
threw
herself
on
her
bed
still
dressed
for
her
heart
was
overflowing
ah
why
why
is
albert
so
trusting
why
did
he
let
me
come
here
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
run
the
risk
of
offending
the
duchess
and
when
genevieve
tried
to
reason
with
her
i
am
suffering
little
sister
she
replied
i
am
so
unhappy
for
the
sight
of
the
duke
at
the
window
distressed
me
i
tremble
at
the
idea
of
seeing
him
again
and
yet
i
long
for
the
time
when
i
can
give
him
my
hand
but
this
is
serious
said
genevieve
i
thought
you
had
recovered
from
all
that
nonsense
or
rather
i
thought
you
would
be
less
affected
she
helped
esperance
to
undress
the
poor
child
let
her
do
so
without
a
word
she
slept
badly
haunted
by
dreams
and
troubled
with
nightmare
at
six
in
the
morning
she
woke
up
feverishly
and
rang
for
the
maid
the
little
breton
appeared
five
minutes
later
her
eyes
still
full
of
sleep
her
cap
crooked
will
you
get
me
a
little
warm
water
asked
esperance
it
is
cold
from
the
tap
it
is
too
early
i
am
afraid
mademoiselle
must
please
to
wait
a
little
well
be
as
quick
as
you
can
please
i
want
to
go
for
a
walk
in
the
park
while
there
is
no
one
about
the
little
breton
laughed
you
wo
run
any
danger
of
finding
anyone
at
this
hour
what
will
the
ladies
take
for
breakfast
two
cups
of
chocolate
please
said
genevieve
beginning
to
get
up
be
so
good
as
to
make
haste
jeanette
get
us
our
hot
water
and
our
chocolate
like
a
good
girl
and
say
nothing
to
anyone
jeanette
looked
in
the
mirror
adjusted
her
cap
put
back
a
stray
lock
of
hair
and
opened
the
door
but
she
stopped
looking
at
the
girls
craftily
which
way
were
you
going
mademoiselle
that
all
depends
which
way
is
the
prettiest
when
you
leave
the
château
you
must
turn
to
your
right
and
walk
to
the
first
thicket
about
ten
minutes
through
the
thicket
and
you
will
come
out
on
the
big
terrace
that
is
where
they
always
take
the
guests
and
say
how
beautiful
it
is
thank
you
said
genevieve
to
the
right
then
the
thicket
and
the
terrace
we
are
likely
to
meet
anyone
nobody
is
abroad
but
the
cats
at
this
hour
and
outside
the
door
she
made
a
face
like
a
mischievous
child
who
had
just
played
a
trick
running
rapidly
across
the
long
corridors
she
mounted
to
the
second
storey
opened
an
which
led
to
another
room
and
knocked
lightly
the
duke
opened
the
door
you
here
jeanette
what
is
it
my
godfather
she
said
very
low
the
young
ladies
are
getting
up
now
and
i
think
they
are
going
to
walk
in
the
grove
to
the
right
of
the
château
they
are
going
alone
certainly
no
one
else
is
awake
but
they
may
be
going
to
meet
their
lovers
why
did
you
come
to
tell
me
yourself
instead
of
sending
my
man
because
he
is
a
lazy
fellow
who
would
have
taken
an
hour
to
dress
and
then
would
have
told
a
lie
and
said
i
told
him
too
late
very
well
run
along
now
and
do
get
caught
so
jeanette
sped
quickly
towards
the
kitchen
to
get
the
hot
water
in
a
great
copper
can
which
she
half
emptied
on
the
way
to
ease
the
weight
as
soon
as
they
were
dressed
esperance
and
genevieve
made
quick
work
of
their
chocolate
and
started
out
it
was
very
still
it
is
the
sleeping
beauty
wood
said
esperance
they
went
towards
the
grove
they
saw
on
their
right
at
the
entrance
to
it
esperance
closed
her
parasol
and
stopped
suddenly
pressing
genevieve
hand
some
one
has
been
here
already
they
both
stopped
motionless
listening
not
a
sound
they
slowly
continued
on
their
way
but
the
thicket
did
not
lead
to
the
terrace
and
ended
in
a
little
enclosed
dell
on
a
pedestal
a
figure
of
in
overlooked
a
stone
bench
we
have
lost
our
way
said
genevieve
let
us
go
back
no
it
is
charming
here
let
us
go
on
to
the
bench
i
am
a
little
tired
and
my
heart
is
beating
so
what
was
that
she
put
her
companion
hand
above
her
heart
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
are
you
so
nervous
ah
replied
esperance
with
great
apprehension
of
she
knew
not
what
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
struggle
the
presence
in
this
house
of
the
duke
de
morlay
overcomes
me
i
do
know
whether
that
is
love
but
at
least
it
tells
me
that
i
do
not
love
albert
come
dear
let
us
rest
a
moment
just
then
a
man
stepped
out
from
the
thicket
and
barred
their
way
the
duke
stood
before
them
esperance
uttered
one
cry
and
fell
in
a
faint
the
duke
started
forward
to
catch
her
but
genevieve
repulsed
him
it
is
a
cowardly
trick
you
have
played
on
us
sir
i
understand
now
that
we
did
not
lose
our
way
but
were
duped
by
your
orders
as
she
spoke
she
was
trying
to
support
esperance
but
almost
falling
herself
under
the
weight
of
the
inert
body
she
cried
at
her
own
impotence
but
she
was
obliged
to
accept
the
duke
help
to
get
esperance
as
far
as
the
marble
bench
try
she
said
holding
out
esperance
tiny
handkerchief
to
get
me
a
little
water
instantly
mademoiselle
there
is
a
fountain
near
at
hand
when
he
came
back
genevieve
moistened
the
poor
child
temples
the
duke
was
very
pale
mademoiselle
believe
me
that
i
am
greatly
upset
at
what
has
happened
i
had
no
idea
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
excuse
you
esperance
looks
a
little
better
had
you
not
better
go
away
but
i
can
not
leave
you
all
alone
like
this
he
took
esperance
hand
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
warmth
came
back
into
it
esperance
opened
her
eyes
still
half
unconscious
she
looked
at
him
curiously
then
she
cried
sharply
out
have
mercy
go
away
go
away
and
she
gave
way
to
hysterical
sobs
the
duke
said
humbly
i
will
leave
you
and
then
kneeling
before
her
forgive
me
i
am
going
i
am
leaving
you
but
i
entreat
you
to
forgive
me
he
was
sincere
in
what
he
said
both
girls
felt
it
esperance
had
risen
gently
i
am
betrothed
to
count
styvens
she
said
you
know
that
i
know
that
my
emotion
just
now
was
foolish
but
i
am
sick
at
heart
and
i
am
not
always
able
to
control
myself
you
are
good
i
see
that
please
help
me
to
cure
myself
i
will
be
grateful
to
you
all
my
life
i
give
you
my
word
his
voice
trembled
i
will
make
myself
and
he
went
away
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
the
two
girls
took
counsel
as
to
what
course
they
should
pursue
esperance
in
despair
threw
herself
on
genevieve
judgment
and
genevieve
asked
permission
to
consult
maurice
could
we
not
keep
it
as
a
secret
i
am
afraid
darling
that
that
would
not
be
right
we
are
sure
of
maurice
discretion
and
we
need
advice
as
well
as
help
esperance
looked
at
her
companion
how
could
the
duke
have
known
oh
i
suppose
the
little
breton
girl
who
waits
on
us
was
the
culprit
we
must
get
rid
of
her
we
have
only
three
days
to
spend
here
and
then
too
i
am
sure
that
the
duke
will
keep
his
word
i
was
struck
by
his
pallor
and
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
you
were
full
of
tears
but
i
believe
he
was
sincere
there
is
less
to
fear
from
staying
than
fleeing
perhaps
since
we
know
that
let
us
go
back
she
helped
her
dear
little
friend
to
get
up
and
they
returned
to
the
house
as
they
had
come
mademoiselle
frahender
was
just
coming
out
to
look
for
them
here
we
are
little
lady
do
scold
said
esperance
playfully
the
little
old
lady
shook
her
head
chidingly
you
do
not
look
well
my
child
you
are
up
too
early
six
that
pert
little
breton
told
me
when
i
found
her
fumbling
in
our
trunks
when
i
told
her
that
i
was
going
to
complain
of
her
she
said
do
do
that
madame
my
godfather
the
duke
de
morlay
would
never
forgive
me
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
i
promise
to
say
nothing
but
you
must
watch
her
carefully
they
were
just
going
in
when
maurice
joined
them
out
of
breath
hello
cousin
where
do
you
spring
from
i
have
been
looking
for
you
for
half
an
hour
to
give
you
the
programme
edited
by
jean
and
enlivened
by
your
humble
servant
here
you
are
and
here
you
are
naughty
lady
who
gives
no
word
of
warning
to
her
lover
of
early
morning
escapades
oh
maurice
it
was
i
who
led
genevieve
astray
and
i
am
doubly
repentant
she
will
tell
you
why
maurice
grew
serious
what
means
that
haggard
face
cousin
and
the
collar
of
your
dress
is
all
wet
come
come
genevieve
herself
seems
ill
at
ease
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
two
have
been
up
to
well
take
her
into
that
grove
you
will
find
a
bench
there
and
she
will
tell
you
all
about
it
i
am
going
to
rest
replied
esperance
genevieve
and
maurice
sat
down
in
the
grove
after
she
had
told
him
what
had
happened
she
added
what
seems
to
me
to
make
it
really
serious
is
that
i
believe
the
duke
to
be
in
earnest
love
and
flirtation
often
look
alike
said
the
young
man
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
do
think
so
said
the
girl
with
conviction
and
continued
sadly
esperance
is
fighting
against
this
infatuation
with
all
her
strength
but
i
am
very
uneasy
and
if
the
duke
should
love
her
enough
to
offer
to
marry
her
you
think
that
likely
what
can
resist
love
tell
me
that
and
her
beautiful
eyes
swimming
with
tears
looked
anxiously
trustingly
into
the
young
man
face
i
tell
you
what
i
truly
believe
and
that
is
that
esperance
loves
the
duke
the
young
painter
meditated
for
a
long
time
come
on
we
must
go
back
he
said
finally
we
must
get
ready
for
the
rehearsal
he
left
the
girl
with
exhortations
to
reason
with
his
cousin
what
the
deuce
is
our
will
for
if
we
ca
exercise
it
maurice
i
am
brave
and
determined
you
know
that
my
sister
and
i
have
struggled
unaided
she
since
she
was
thirteen
i
since
i
was
eight
i
thought
that
she
was
enough
to
fill
all
my
life
and
now
and
now
he
asked
tenderly
taking
her
hand
all
my
life
is
yours
i
should
not
tell
you
this
but
you
can
judge
by
my
doing
so
the
impotence
of
will
against
she
drew
away
her
hand
hastily
ran
to
the
staircase
and
disappeared
he
heard
the
door
open
and
his
cousin
voice
saying
how
pale
you
are
genevieve
what
are
you
dreaming
about
cousin
maurice
said
albert
putting
his
hand
gently
on
his
shoulder
that
hand
felt
to
maurice
as
heavy
as
remorse
let
us
go
and
see
what
is
going
on
said
the
young
painter
there
is
jean
coming
to
look
for
us
now
chapter
xxiv
in
the
great
hall
of
the
château
a
charming
theatre
had
been
built
everything
was
ready
for
the
rehearsal
an
enormous
revolving
platform
held
three
wooden
squares
which
would
serve
as
frames
for
the
tableaux
vivants
the
mechanism
had
been
arranged
by
an
eminent
parisian
engineer
a
curtain
decorated
by
maurice
served
as
background
there
were
eleven
little
dressing
rooms
seven
for
the
women
four
for
the
men
maurice
saw
the
duke
seated
straddlewise
on
a
chair
and
smoking
a
cigarette
the
three
men
went
up
to
him
before
he
was
aware
of
their
presence
at
sound
of
albert
voice
he
sprang
to
his
feet
almost
as
if
expecting
an
attack
his
nostrils
were
dilated
his
face
set
in
an
instant
he
resumed
his
usual
manner
and
shook
hands
with
the
young
men
you
were
asleep
suggested
the
count
no
i
was
dreaming
and
i
think
you
must
have
figured
in
my
dream
let
us
hear
of
the
dream
oh
no
dreams
ought
not
to
be
told
and
he
pretended
to
busy
himself
with
some
orders
the
guests
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
tableaux
vivants
began
slowly
to
stream
in
maurice
took
jean
aside
and
told
him
what
had
happened
that
morning
you
must
keep
watch
too
i
am
not
going
to
leave
the
duke
when
esperance
and
genevieve
came
in
maurice
caught
the
expression
in
a
mirror
he
saw
him
move
away
and
join
a
distant
group
where
he
lingered
chatting
jean
thought
esperance
looked
uneasy
albert
came
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
she
smiled
sadly
she
was
looking
for
some
one
the
duke
had
disappeared
before
she
had
seen
him
after
a
long
discussion
it
was
decided
to
have
a
dress
rehearsal
esperance
was
not
in
the
first
picture
so
she
would
have
had
ample
time
to
have
dressed
at
leisure
but
nevertheless
she
put
her
things
on
quite
feverishly
her
costume
consisted
only
it
is
true
of
a
light
peplum
over
a
foundation
genevieve
helped
her
to
dress
in
each
was
one
of
maurice
designs
illustrating
just
how
the
dress
hair
were
to
be
arranged
for
andromeda
esperance
was
to
have
bare
feet
and
wear
on
her
hair
a
garland
of
flowers
the
three
first
tableaux
revolved
before
the
duke
and
his
staff
composed
of
albert
jean
maurice
and
some
of
the
distinguished
guests
and
the
order
was
given
to
summon
the
artists
for
the
second
set
which
was
composed
of
the
next
three
pictures
the
first
tableaux
of
the
second
group
represented
circe
with
the
companions
of
ulysses
changed
into
swine
the
marvellous
lady
rupper
was
to
represent
circe
she
entered
dramatically
half
nude
her
tunic
open
to
her
waist
caught
at
intervals
by
diamond
clasps
her
peplum
held
in
place
by
a
garland
of
bay
leaves
she
was
very
beautiful
her
husband
a
wealthy
american
laughed
at
sight
of
her
a
coarse
laugh
the
laugh
of
all
germans
even
when
americanized
the
second
picture
represented
judith
and
holofernes
the
beautiful
brunette
the
marquise
de
chaussey
in
a
daring
costume
designed
by
maurice
held
in
her
hand
a
magnificent
scimitar
the
property
of
she
was
to
pose
raising
the
curtain
as
in
the
picture
of
regnault
the
third
picture
was
the
deliverance
of
andromeda
when
esperance
appeared
so
slender
so
fragile
her
long
hair
waving
in
floods
of
pale
gold
almost
to
the
floor
a
murmur
of
almost
sacred
admiration
rang
through
the
hall
lady
rupper
approached
her
and
taking
the
child
hair
in
her
hands
cried
out
oh
my
dear
it
is
more
beautiful
than
the
american
gold
the
duke
came
up
to
esperance
i
should
have
preferred
enchaining
you
to
delivering
you
mademoiselle
i
can
speak
now
in
the
person
of
andromeda
and
thank
you
for
that
deliverance
which
you
promised
she
answered
with
a
little
smile
she
had
spoken
so
low
that
only
the
duke
could
hear
the
ending
which
he
alone
understood
he
had
promised
to
deliver
her
from
his
love
but
at
that
instant
he
revolted
against
the
thought
and
the
admonition
why
not
he
muttered
to
himself
she
must
be
happier
with
me
than
with
that
insufferable
bore
i
will
keep
my
word
until
she
herself
absolves
me
from
it
they
had
to
arrange
her
pose
against
the
rock
maurice
and
albert
helped
her
while
the
duke
watched
from
a
distance
and
criticized
the
effect
all
at
once
he
cried
out
that
is
perfect
do
move
now
the
mechanician
must
mark
the
place
to
set
the
fetters
for
the
hands
and
feet
maurice
stepped
back
by
the
duke
to
judge
of
the
effect
it
is
excellent
he
said
looking
only
thinking
only
as
an
artist
that
child
has
a
beauty
of
proportion
a
dazzling
grace
and
the
most
lovely
face
imaginable
as
the
duke
did
not
speak
maurice
looked
at
him
he
was
standing
upright
leaning
against
a
table
pale
as
death
are
you
ill
asked
maurice
no
no
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
said
in
an
unnatural
voice
will
you
see
to
it
please
that
they
do
not
leave
her
suspended
that
way
too
long
tell
albert
to
raise
her
head
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
going
to
faint
he
started
forward
i
will
go
said
maurice
stopping
him
when
the
machinist
finished
screwing
the
rings
in
the
rock
maurice
asked
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
repeat
this
tableaux
at
once
the
duke
approved
the
terrifying
dragon
was
properly
arranged
on
the
ground
the
wonderful
dragon
which
was
the
design
of
a
renowned
sculptor
and
perfectly
executed
by
gerard
in
papier
maché
perseus
the
duke
with
one
foot
on
the
head
of
the
vanquished
monster
bent
towards
andromeda
the
breath
of
her
mouth
was
hot
on
his
lips
and
he
could
hear
the
wild
beating
of
her
little
heart
he
felt
an
infinite
tenderness
steal
over
him
and
when
a
tear
trembled
on
the
young
girl
eyelashes
he
forgot
everything
wiped
the
tear
away
tenderly
with
the
end
of
his
finger
and
kissed
it
lovingly
happily
the
turning
stage
was
almost
out
of
sight
and
nobody
except
genevieve
had
caught
sight
of
the
incident
esperance
breathed
god
my
god
the
duke
raised
the
poor
child
and
said
to
her
very
low
i
love
you
esperance
she
murmured
you
must
not
you
must
not
while
he
was
loosing
her
chains
he
continued
i
love
you
and
i
will
do
anything
to
win
your
love
she
strengthened
herself
desperately
you
do
not
need
to
do
anything
for
it
alas
and
she
fled
when
the
count
came
to
find
her
there
was
only
the
duke
talking
to
the
stage
hands
where
is
esperance
i
have
no
idea
replied
charles
de
morlay
dryly
albert
turned
on
his
heel
delighted
to
see
the
duke
out
of
humour
genevieve
caught
up
with
andromeda
who
was
running
away
out
of
breath
seeing
nothing
hearing
nothing
genevieve
saw
her
enter
the
grove
leading
to
the
clearing
and
there
she
joined
her
esperance
my
darling
my
little
sister
stop
i
beg
you
her
voice
calmed
the
girl
she
caught
hold
of
one
of
the
branches
and
clung
to
it
gasping
genevieve
genevieve
why
am
i
here
her
eyes
shone
with
a
wild
light
she
seemed
to
be
absolutely
exalted
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
and
i
love
him
and
she
threw
herself
in
her
friend
arms
i
am
as
happy
as
you
now
for
i
love
the
thick
cloud
that
hung
over
everything
is
gone
everything
is
bright
and
beautiful
this
dark
grove
is
sparkling
with
sunlight
and
genevieve
stopped
her
little
sister
you
are
raving
your
pulse
is
racing
with
fever
we
must
go
back
think
of
poor
albert
esperance
drew
herself
up
proudly
replying
i
will
never
betray
him
i
will
tell
the
truth
and
i
will
become
the
wife
of
the
duke
you
are
talking
wildly
dearest
the
duke
will
not
marry
you
he
will
marry
me
i
swear
it
albert
will
enter
the
chartist
monastery
and
the
countess
styvens
will
die
of
sorrow
the
countess
styvens
said
esperance
slowly
as
the
sweet
face
of
the
mother
came
before
her
mind
eye
she
began
to
tremble
all
over
maurice
had
followed
the
girls
into
the
grove
and
he
found
them
now
in
each
other
arms
genevieve
said
esperance
not
a
word
of
what
i
have
said
have
you
both
gone
crazy
they
are
looking
everywhere
for
esperance
for
the
of
paris
and
here
you
are
congratulating
and
kissing
each
other
cousin
i
needed
the
air
do
scold
genevieve
looked
for
me
and
found
me
before
anybody
else
and
i
kissed
her
because
i
love
her
most
she
spoke
fast
and
laughed
nervously
who
freed
you
from
your
chains
perseus
it
was
his
duty
and
now
he
is
going
to
give
you
an
apple
then
she
said
very
prettily
i
must
try
to
deserve
it
come
help
me
to
make
myself
beautiful
she
led
genevieve
away
by
the
hand
maurice
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
somehow
he
guessed
what
sudden
change
had
operated
upon
his
cousin
spirit
something
must
have
taken
place
in
the
corridor
between
these
two
he
murmured
sadly
poor
albert
poor
little
cousin
the
young
count
appeared
before
him
in
his
most
radiant
humour
i
have
just
met
esperance
he
said
she
was
joyous
brilliant
i
have
never
before
seen
her
so
happy
maurice
gnawed
his
moustache
and
moved
rather
angrily
we
should
never
have
come
here
he
said
success
has
turned
her
head
she
was
born
for
success
said
the
count
i
often
ask
myself
whether
i
have
a
right
to
accept
the
sacrifice
she
is
making
for
me
my
dear
friend
when
things
are
well
you
should
leave
them
alone
when
you
love
as
i
love
you
desire
above
everything
the
happiness
of
the
one
you
love
unless
the
one
you
love
should
prefer
someone
else
to
you
you
are
wrong
maurice
i
would
sacrifice
myself
for
happiness
if
i
knew
she
wanted
to
marry
another
man
maurice
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
are
not
of
the
same
race
your
blood
runs
colder
in
your
veins
than
mine
for
mine
boils
but
perhaps
you
have
a
better
understanding
of
these
things
and
he
left
the
count
to
go
and
help
the
duke
prepare
the
judgment
of
paris
three
young
girls
had
been
chosen
for
this
tableau
mlle
de
berneuve
a
beautiful
brunette
hera
mlle
lebrun
with
flaming
hair
athene
and
esperance
delicately
blonde
was
to
represent
aphrodite
to
whom
the
shepherd
paris
would
award
the
prize
for
beauty
to
personify
aphrodite
the
girl
wore
a
long
pink
tunic
with
a
peplum
of
the
same
colour
heavily
embroidered
her
hair
was
piled
high
on
her
head
leaving
the
lovely
nape
of
her
neck
half
covered
by
her
draperies
her
exquisitely
delicate
arms
emerging
from
a
sleeveless
tunic
to
represent
the
shepherd
paris
the
duke
was
wearing
a
short
tunic
embroidered
with
agate
beads
to
hold
the
stuff
down
and
a
sheep
skin
a
red
cap
was
on
his
head
he
was
magnificent
to
look
upon
the
stage
began
to
revolve
paris
held
out
his
apple
to
aphrodite
who
went
crimson
at
his
glance
the
girl
blushes
did
not
escape
the
audience
where
the
comments
varied
according
to
the
person
who
made
them
maurice
genevieve
and
jean
understood
what
esperance
read
in
eyes
a
sad
smile
gave
a
melancholy
grace
to
the
lovely
aphrodite
both
the
actors
had
forgotten
that
they
were
not
alone
hypnotized
under
the
gaze
of
paris
the
young
girl
made
a
gesture
towards
him
a
sharp
do
move
from
the
prompter
brought
her
back
to
herself
she
turned
her
head
saw
the
audience
with
the
eyes
and
glasses
of
everyone
focussed
upon
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
all
know
her
secret
she
tottered
and
supported
herself
upon
athene
she
must
have
fallen
from
the
frame
and
been
badly
hurt
if
the
duke
had
not
caught
her
just
in
time
a
cry
escaped
from
the
audience
the
marquis
de
montagnac
gave
a
sign
to
the
stage
hands
to
stop
revolving
the
stage
albert
climbed
up
on
the
stage
at
once
he
thrust
paris
quickly
aside
picked
up
the
girl
and
carried
her
out
on
to
the
terrace
maurice
and
jean
followed
him
she
was
not
unconscious
but
she
could
not
speak
and
she
recognized
no
one
genevieve
knelt
beside
her
at
first
delicacy
discretion
held
the
spectators
back
but
curiosity
soon
drove
them
forward
but
the
duke
did
not
appear
he
had
seemingly
vanished
the
doctor
of
the
château
was
called
from
playing
croquet
he
began
by
ordering
the
crowd
away
esperance
was
stretched
out
on
an
easy
chair
on
the
terrace
the
doctor
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
amazed
at
her
beauty
then
sat
beside
her
feeling
her
pulse
genevieve
described
what
had
happened
he
listened
attentively
there
is
nothing
serious
he
said
only
a
little
exhaustion
and
collapse
i
will
go
and
mix
a
soothing
drink
for
her
esperance
still
unconscious
was
carried
by
her
fiancé
to
her
room
where
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
put
her
to
bed
albert
went
back
to
wait
for
the
doctor
maurice
went
in
search
of
charles
de
morlay
he
met
a
forester
who
told
him
that
the
duke
had
gone
for
a
ride
in
the
forest
and
had
sent
word
to
the
duchess
that
he
might
not
be
back
to
lunch
maurice
returned
disturbed
and
thoughtful
genevieve
was
waiting
for
him
with
the
news
that
the
doctor
had
himself
administered
a
sleeping
draught
to
esperance
which
he
said
should
make
her
sleep
at
least
five
hours
so
much
the
better
that
will
give
us
a
little
time
to
consider
and
to
decide
what
is
to
be
done
the
truth
is
that
we
ought
to
clear
out
this
very
day
love
is
a
miscreant
not
always
fortunately
murmured
genevieve
you
genevieve
have
a
balanced
mind
calm
just
if
only
my
cousin
had
your
equilibrium
oh
maurice
maurice
a
tear
ran
down
genevieve
eyelashes
she
closed
her
eyes
he
took
the
lovely
head
in
his
hands
and
his
lips
rested
on
her
pure
forehead
they
remained
so
for
one
marvellous
second
when
he
left
her
maurice
met
albert
styvens
they
walked
side
by
side
towards
the
woods
i
am
very
much
alarmed
said
the
count
not
about
esperance
health
but
about
her
state
of
mind
i
am
a
poor
psychologist
but
my
love
for
your
cousin
has
sharpened
my
wits
it
seems
to
me
that
the
duke
is
trying
to
make
esperance
love
him
possibly
i
had
not
noticed
yes
maurice
you
have
noticed
and
you
have
no
right
to
deny
it
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
the
duke
and
i
both
love
your
cousin
one
of
us
must
lose
just
now
i
repulsed
the
duke
so
rudely
that
he
could
have
demanded
satisfaction
but
i
foresee
that
he
will
let
it
pass
that
attitude
so
unusual
to
his
temperament
proves
that
he
wants
to
avoid
scandal
why
what
is
his
object
i
do
know
said
maurice
he
has
gone
riding
in
the
forest
probably
to
calm
his
nerves
with
solitude
he
loves
your
fiancée
but
his
honour
forces
him
to
respect
her
perhaps
said
albert
i
think
said
maurice
that
we
should
all
leave
this
evening
or
morning
at
the
latest
esperance
is
not
ill
only
worn
out
she
is
easily
exhausted
and
if
she
loves
the
duke
pursued
the
count
then
it
is
my
place
to
ask
you
what
you
are
going
to
do
about
it
albert
was
silent
a
minute
then
raising
his
pale
face
answered
slowly
if
she
loves
the
duke
i
shall
have
to
ask
him
what
are
his
intentions
and
if
as
i
believe
he
wishes
to
marry
her
i
shall
die
a
chartist
the
third
gong
vibrated
announcing
lunch
after
lunch
albert
maurice
jean
and
genevieve
settled
themselves
under
a
great
oak
which
was
said
to
have
been
planted
by
a
delightful
little
duchess
of
who
had
been
celebrated
at
court
during
the
regency
a
marble
table
and
a
heavy
circular
bench
made
this
wild
corner
quite
cosy
and
sheltered
from
the
sun
and
from
the
curious
the
tree
was
just
opposite
the
tower
where
esperance
was
sleeping
so
deeply
and
mlle
frahender
was
to
give
a
signal
from
the
window
when
she
awoke
neither
of
them
felt
much
inclined
for
conversation
for
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
window
opposite
about
four
mlle
frahender
appeared
and
genevieve
hastened
to
the
room
esperance
was
sitting
up
in
bed
remembering
nothing
albert
maurice
and
jean
are
over
there
do
you
wish
to
see
them
esperance
rose
up
quickly
wrapping
a
robe
of
blue
japanese
crêpe
embroidered
in
pink
wisterias
about
her
and
gracefully
fastened
up
her
hair
let
them
come
if
you
please
now
the
young
men
entered
and
stopped
in
amazement
at
the
change
that
had
already
taken
place
in
her
instead
of
finding
her
a
wreck
they
discovered
her
pink
gay
and
laughing
what
happened
to
me
she
asked
my
little
mademoiselle
does
not
know
she
was
not
well
herself
there
is
my
aphrodite
costume
what
happened
to
me
it
was
very
simple
explained
maurice
you
stayed
too
long
with
your
head
hanging
down
during
the
rehearsal
and
as
you
were
tired
it
made
you
albert
brought
you
here
and
you
have
been
asleep
for
five
hours
now
you
are
your
charming
self
again
we
will
leave
you
so
that
you
can
dress
and
then
if
you
feel
like
it
we
will
take
you
for
a
drive
i
will
be
very
quick
in
ten
minutes
i
will
be
with
you
the
young
people
did
not
know
what
to
think
it
would
now
be
very
difficult
to
suggest
that
esperance
should
withdraw
from
the
fête
as
apparently
every
trace
of
her
indisposition
had
disappeared
then
albert
spoke
i
am
going
to
ask
esperance
to
give
up
appearing
at
this
performance
as
a
favour
to
me
he
said
i
shall
contribute
largely
to
the
charitable
fund
and
we
can
go
back
to
penhouet
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
esperance
came
into
the
little
salon
here
i
am
you
see
and
the
ten
minutes
is
not
yet
up
a
discreet
tap
at
the
door
made
them
all
turn
round
the
dowager
duchess
appeared
ah
my
dear
child
what
a
joy
to
see
you
so
restored
i
must
apologize
madame
for
the
trouble
i
gave
you
it
is
all
over
all
over
she
said
shaking
her
pretty
head
and
i
am
as
well
as
possible
i
am
more
than
delighted
said
the
duchess
sitting
down
you
have
no
idea
my
dear
albert
of
the
perfect
disaster
esperance
absence
would
have
caused
she
is
the
star
of
our
bill
as
they
say
and
on
whom
we
all
rely
you
know
that
my
son
wants
to
be
elected
deputy
and
this
fête
will
secure
him
the
votes
of
the
whole
community
more
than
fifteen
hundred
people
have
taken
tickets
the
local
livery
stable
men
count
on
making
a
fortune
all
the
villagers
are
getting
their
rooms
ready
to
let
if
that
adorable
child
had
failed
us
nothing
could
have
made
it
up
to
them
and
my
son
would
have
been
ruined
she
rose
up
but
she
added
with
the
sweet
smile
that
won
all
hearts
you
see
me
so
happy
so
reassured
that
you
must
all
be
joyful
with
me
the
young
people
led
her
to
the
foot
of
the
stair
the
carriage
was
waiting
to
take
them
for
their
drive
the
visit
from
the
amiable
duchess
rather
disconcerted
albert
and
jean
and
maurice
and
genevieve
everything
seemed
like
the
warring
of
an
implacable
destiny
all
four
felt
absolutely
impotent
the
drive
was
stimulating
esperance
drew
life
at
every
breath
they
could
watch
the
colour
coming
back
into
her
cheeks
as
the
carriage
came
out
into
a
clearing
the
duke
de
morlay
rode
wildly
by
his
horse
was
covered
with
sweat
and
trembling
so
that
he
had
some
difficulty
in
mastering
it
the
duke
inquired
for
health
and
decided
that
it
must
be
excellent
from
her
looks
but
my
dear
albert
he
said
laughing
you
almost
knocked
me
over
this
morning
however
i
do
not
blame
you
i
would
have
done
as
much
myself
in
your
place
however
i
must
be
off
my
horse
is
fagged
i
shall
see
you
later
and
he
was
gone
how
pale
the
duke
looked
exclaimed
esperance
he
is
fatigued
he
has
been
riding
since
this
morning
did
he
not
lunch
with
you
cousin
no
why
did
he
go
away
in
such
haste
you
are
too
curious
then
looking
hard
at
her
perhaps
he
thought
like
the
good
duchess
that
your
weakness
was
serious
and
that
all
his
little
arrangements
were
going
to
fall
through
i
understand
that
the
duchess
cared
since
the
election
of
her
son
is
at
stake
but
the
duke
how
would
it
affect
him
albert
sitting
opposite
her
in
the
carriage
looked
her
full
in
the
face
perhaps
he
will
never
find
another
opportunity
to
pay
his
court
to
you
whew
that
is
straightforward
bluntness
for
you
thought
maurice
esperance
grew
red
the
recollection
of
what
had
happened
began
to
come
back
little
by
little
she
closed
her
eyes
to
be
able
to
think
more
clearly
albert
left
her
in
her
silence
a
minute
then
he
said
we
had
planned
to
carry
you
away
but
you
heard
what
the
duchess
said
just
now
i
feel
bound
by
the
confidence
of
that
old
friend
to
remain
my
fate
is
in
your
pretty
hands
be
circumspect
with
the
duke
frank
and
loyal
with
your
fiancé
and
he
took
her
hands
in
a
long
kiss
the
coachman
was
told
to
turn
around
for
it
was
getting
late
the
horses
set
off
at
a
trot
nothing
more
was
said
between
them
about
the
duke
after
dinner
the
duke
arose
and
announced
the
fête
will
be
the
day
after
we
have
only
rehearsed
once
and
then
not
in
full
i
feel
somewhat
responsible
for
the
exhaustion
of
our
little
star
her
head
hanging
down
was
so
beautiful
that
i
thought
only
of
the
pose
without
realizing
how
painful
it
must
have
become
to
the
artist
i
ask
mile
darbois
pardon
also
i
should
like
another
stage
director
i
propose
maurice
renaud
our
ingenious
collaborator
to
whom
we
owe
our
magnificent
costumes
and
originality
of
our
decorations
everyone
applauded
and
maurice
was
proclaimed
director
of
the
fête
i
thank
you
and
accept
he
said
simply
he
thought
that
is
his
way
of
getting
rid
of
me
i
hope
my
dear
director
continued
the
duke
that
you
will
make
us
rehearse
hard
if
anything
goes
wrong
we
shall
still
have
the
morning
of
the
following
day
for
the
fête
does
not
begin
until
two
maurice
rose
and
in
a
comical
tone
announced
ladies
gentlemen
and
artists
i
beg
you
to
be
prompt
for
a
rehearsal
of
the
tableaux
vivants
at
ten
any
artist
who
is
late
will
pay
a
fine
of
a
hundred
francs
to
the
poor
of
the
duchess
and
as
they
laughingly
protested
there
is
a
quarter
of
an
hour
grace
accorded
as
in
the
theatres
but
not
one
instant
more
my
is
empowered
to
collect
the
fines
they
followed
the
action
of
the
duchess
and
rose
from
their
seats
the
duke
went
over
to
maurice
i
would
like
to
talk
over
some
of
the
details
with
you
they
must
interest
us
but
they
mean
nothing
to
the
others
a
cigarette
they
strolled
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
a
pretty
chinese
umbrella
sheltered
a
delightful
nook
the
duke
and
maurice
dropped
into
easy
chairs
will
you
give
me
your
word
that
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
will
be
for
you
alone
that
you
will
not
repeat
it
the
young
man
refused
how
can
i
give
my
word
without
even
knowing
the
subject
of
your
confidences
it
concerns
your
cousin
then
it
concerns
count
styvens
indirectly
yes
maurice
got
up
i
would
rather
not
listen
to
you
for
my
duty
as
a
man
of
honour
would
compel
me
to
speak
should
it
be
necessary
the
duke
sat
still
and
reflected
for
a
minute
very
well
you
shall
judge
when
you
have
heard
me
what
you
think
you
had
better
do
i
leave
you
free
i
love
your
cousin
esperance
she
is
the
fiancée
of
count
albert
but
she
is
not
in
love
with
him
maurice
had
thrown
away
his
cigarette
and
leaning
forward
his
hands
clasped
his
eyes
on
the
ground
listened
intently
i
have
paid
her
in
a
way
attentions
for
a
year
i
admit
it
was
wrong
for
i
had
no
definite
intentions
a
visit
to
penhouet
however
completely
changed
my
opinion
of
this
little
maiden
the
atmosphere
of
beauty
of
calm
in
which
she
lived
the
liking
and
respect
i
felt
for
and
madame
darbois
and
the
free
play
of
intelligence
and
taste
i
there
discovered
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
and
i
could
not
forget
the
ordinary
life
of
society
so
artificial
so
devoid
of
real
interest
this
life
that
eats
up
hours
and
weeks
and
months
in
futilities
in
nothings
that
come
to
nothing
all
this
became
suddenly
quite
burdensome
to
me
i
continuously
thought
of
the
adorable
child
i
had
seen
at
penhouet
brighter
than
all
else
in
that
radiant
place
i
was
travelling
and
did
not
learn
of
the
accident
to
your
cousin
and
count
styvens
until
i
returned
to
paris
then
i
wrote
for
news
i
came
back
here
to
my
old
aunt
my
nearest
relative
i
wanted
to
ask
her
to
invite
the
whole
of
the
darbois
family
to
spend
a
month
here
at
montjoie
a
letter
from
count
albert
announcing
his
engagement
to
esperance
was
a
terrible
blow
to
me
i
conceived
the
detestable
idea
of
revenging
myself
on
albert
but
every
scheme
went
against
me
i
have
been
beaten
without
ever
having
fought
then
he
paused
since
you
have
done
me
the
honour
to
make
me
your
confidant
permit
me
to
say
that
the
little
ambush
you
laid
for
esperance
this
morning
the
duke
interrupted
that
ambush
was
a
vulgar
trick
theatrical
and
cheap
i
spare
you
the
trouble
of
having
to
tell
me
so
i
was
about
to
disclose
myself
to
the
young
ladies
when
i
heard
your
cousin
speak
my
name
then
i
kept
still
hoping
to
learn
something
what
man
could
have
resisted
i
heard
these
words
spoken
to
mlle
hardouin
the
presence
of
the
duke
of
morlay
disturbs
me
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
love
but
i
do
know
that
i
do
not
love
albert
they
went
on
towards
the
clearing
i
was
compelled
to
leave
my
hiding
place
you
know
the
rest
the
cry
the
child
gave
and
her
look
of
reproach
unmanned
me
i
understood
at
that
moment
that
i
loved
in
deadly
earnest
that
my
intention
of
avenging
myself
on
albert
was
nothing
but
a
vain
manifestation
of
pride
that
the
ambush
was
a
cowardly
concession
to
my
reputation
as
a
well
deceiver
of
women
you
know
what
i
mean
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
scornfully
the
man
i
was
trying
to
be
has
left
the
man
i
am
and
now
renaud
here
is
what
i
want
you
to
know
esperance
darbois
loves
me
i
was
convinced
of
that
at
the
rehearsal
i
love
her
ardently
in
return
she
will
not
be
happy
with
albert
and
i
want
to
marry
her
i
will
employ
no
means
as
the
lawyers
say
on
other
scores
i
shall
feel
no
remorse
to
have
broken
your
cousin
engagement
my
fortune
is
twice
albert
he
is
a
count
i
a
duke
and
what
is
more
a
frenchman
maurice
stood
up
nervously
you
are
a
very
gallant
man
duke
and
my
sympathy
was
yours
from
your
first
visit
to
penhouet
but
i
am
greatly
distressed
that
you
should
have
made
me
your
confidant
for
i
must
in
honour
bound
support
albert
i
do
not
see
why
it
seems
to
me
that
the
happiness
of
your
cousin
might
count
before
any
friendship
for
albert
styvens
but
where
is
her
real
happiness
i
might
say
her
lasting
happiness
the
moon
had
risen
radiantly
pure
from
their
elevation
on
the
terrace
they
could
overlook
all
the
garden
and
park
sloping
gently
to
the
lake
in
a
boat
two
young
girls
were
rowing
they
were
alone
you
leave
me
free
to
act
absolutely
till
said
maurice
pressing
his
hands
the
duke
remained
alone
on
the
terrace
he
saw
the
young
man
go
rapidly
towards
the
lake
he
heard
him
hail
the
girls
and
saw
him
climb
into
the
boat
with
them
then
disappear
after
he
had
waved
with
genevieve
handkerchief
a
signal
of
adieu
chapter
xxv
when
maurice
and
esperance
and
genevieve
landed
the
duke
was
still
pacing
up
and
down
on
the
terrace
maurice
had
jumped
lightly
on
to
the
shore
and
had
helped
the
young
girls
out
and
having
taken
them
to
the
château
rejoined
the
duke
who
was
waiting
for
him
you
are
right
esperance
loves
you
my
uncle
comes
evening
he
is
a
man
of
such
uprightness
that
he
will
find
no
doubt
the
best
solution
of
this
most
complicated
situation
only
i
beg
you
to
spare
albert
the
duke
replied
instantly
i
will
make
every
effort
to
be
generous
but
this
morning
he
thrust
me
away
from
your
cousin
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
insult
me
i
pretended
to
blame
it
on
his
anxiety
but
i
may
not
be
able
to
control
myself
again
if
he
drives
me
so
far
alas
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
both
of
you
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
thing
that
happens
for
the
love
of
god
keep
cool
and
do
forget
to
come
at
ten
for
the
rehearsal
and
they
parted
maurice
did
not
sleep
a
wink
esperance
and
genevieve
went
to
bed
very
late
after
talking
for
a
long
time
of
the
future
poor
albert
murmured
the
little
star
still
as
she
closed
her
eyes
in
the
very
moment
of
gliding
into
the
unreal
life
of
dreams
mlle
frahender
had
some
difficulty
next
morning
in
waking
the
two
young
girls
another
maid
waited
on
them
for
the
duke
had
sent
his
goddaughter
back
to
her
family
let
us
all
three
take
our
chocolate
together
on
this
little
table
the
sun
is
so
gentle
this
morning
ought
to
have
a
beautiful
life
ahead
of
it
my
parents
come
at
six
and
we
must
go
to
meet
them
she
chattered
on
all
through
the
breakfast
and
kissed
genevieve
in
overflowing
happiness
i
love
to
see
you
so
esperance
said
the
old
mademoiselle
you
have
scarcely
seemed
yourself
lately
even
at
penhouet
now
you
are
truly
yourself
you
are
radiant
with
your
seventeen
years
it
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
you
and
to
listen
to
you
when
the
two
girls
came
into
the
hall
the
director
maurice
renaud
the
marquis
assistant
and
the
louis
de
marset
were
the
only
others
who
had
arrived
the
manufacturer
of
the
paper
models
was
arranging
the
rock
the
dragon
and
the
headless
horse
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
held
a
brush
red
with
dragon
blood
gave
it
a
touch
and
recoiled
to
admire
the
effect
then
taking
the
sea
weed
he
had
gathered
from
real
rocks
began
placing
it
in
little
bunches
on
his
pasteboard
rock
in
regard
to
the
half
white
horse
a
magnificent
cardboard
mount
said
maurice
flatteringly
we
shall
not
use
it
another
tableau
has
been
substituted
for
that
one
the
assistant
came
up
to
maurice
can
you
tell
me
sir
why
they
will
not
give
the
and
the
bull
because
mlle
darbois
has
been
far
from
well
and
the
duchess
has
requested
that
she
shall
not
appear
in
more
than
two
tableaux
she
is
to
play
a
very
difficult
duet
as
well
you
know
and
afterwards
she
will
have
to
talk
to
all
the
people
who
crowd
around
her
to
buy
flowers
jean
was
charged
with
excluding
all
those
who
were
not
in
the
tableaux
albert
was
included
in
those
not
admitted
and
he
certainly
would
have
held
it
against
the
duke
had
he
still
been
director
but
jean
explained
to
him
that
maurice
had
taken
this
means
of
making
the
rehearsal
go
more
quickly
genevieve
who
was
also
excluded
kept
the
count
company
and
tried
to
distract
him
but
he
was
in
a
very
despondent
humour
when
he
saw
the
duke
arrive
so
late
he
said
somewhat
crossly
he
is
delaying
the
rehearsal
oh
no
said
genevieve
he
does
not
come
on
until
the
second
group
and
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
appear
in
costume
when
andromeda
was
extended
upon
her
rock
the
duke
took
his
position
they
were
alone
in
their
wooden
frame
wo
you
trust
yourself
to
me
he
breathed
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
my
life
is
yours
she
replied
the
scene
had
turned
very
quickly
the
curtain
had
fallen
maurice
came
up
and
helped
the
duke
to
unfasten
the
girl
she
was
radiant
he
was
transformed
maurice
guessed
that
they
had
spoken
together
but
he
asked
nothing
the
second
tableau
was
given
immediately
paris
was
not
in
costume
he
held
the
apple
to
the
glorious
aphrodite
the
picture
turned
the
rehearsal
was
over
for
esperance
the
duke
still
had
to
take
part
in
two
other
scenes
when
esperance
was
dressed
she
followed
maurice
advice
to
go
join
genevieve
and
albert
what
a
relief
he
exclaimed
at
sight
of
her
i
began
to
think
it
would
never
be
over
yet
we
did
not
lose
any
time
oh
no
but
now
it
will
go
more
slowly
the
countess
de
morgueil
will
have
to
make
several
repetitions
of
her
tableau
of
the
enchantress
melusina
it
was
the
little
de
marset
who
had
spoken
esperance
started
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
rumoured
that
the
very
pretty
countess
de
morgueil
widowed
two
years
ago
was
violently
infatuated
with
the
duke
de
morlay
who
was
said
not
to
be
indifferent
to
her
affection
afraid
apparently
that
his
meaning
had
not
been
plain
marset
insisted
she
is
always
circling
about
the
duke
but
does
he
care
for
her
asked
a
young
woman
with
a
hard
face
who
was
just
going
to
give
herself
a
dose
of
morphine
and
who
was
never
seen
without
a
cigarette
between
her
lips
who
knows
queried
marset
with
a
knowing
air
esperance
had
grown
very
pale
albert
was
controlling
himself
with
difficulty
he
observed
genevieve
constraint
and
the
trouble
of
his
fiancée
shall
we
walk
a
little
they
walked
towards
the
woods
and
maurice
in
some
excitement
soon
joined
them
he
was
greatly
troubled
and
longed
to
be
able
to
tell
albert
how
things
were
going
he
was
very
fond
of
this
fine
fellow
and
at
the
same
time
felt
great
sympathy
for
the
duke
he
understood
perfectly
well
why
esperance
should
prefer
him
to
the
count
but
at
the
same
time
he
blamed
her
a
little
for
causing
so
many
complications
when
he
saw
her
so
fresh
and
charming
beside
albert
he
grew
more
disturbed
genevieve
quietly
drew
him
aside
you
are
getting
excited
maurice
and
i
see
clearly
that
you
are
blaming
esperance
but
let
me
tell
you
dear
love
that
you
are
unjust
at
this
moment
esperance
is
walking
in
a
dream
nothing
real
exists
for
her
for
three
months
she
has
suffered
very
much
struggled
very
much
and
felt
so
much
events
have
come
very
quickly
she
finds
herself
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
fount
of
the
realization
of
all
her
fondest
hopes
to
be
loved
by
the
one
she
loves
be
patient
maurice
she
is
so
young
and
so
sensitive
your
heart
dearest
genevieve
is
an
admirable
accountant
it
adds
the
reasons
multiplies
the
excuses
subtracts
the
errors
and
divides
the
responsibility
you
are
adorable
and
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
come
with
me
it
is
time
for
the
concert
you
go
on
immediately
after
delaunay
the
duchess
is
unable
to
contain
herself
at
the
idea
of
hearing
you
recite
her
poem
the
duke
passed
by
accompanied
by
the
pretty
countess
de
morgueil
at
whose
conversation
he
was
smiling
politely
and
replying
vaguely
he
seemed
not
to
have
seen
the
others
like
esperance
he
was
living
in
a
world
of
dreams
happy
in
a
realm
where
there
was
neither
impatience
nor
jealousy
he
knew
that
he
was
loved
after
lunch
esperance
said
that
she
was
going
to
rest
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
next
day
her
father
and
mother
were
to
come
on
the
princess
little
yacht
she
and
mlle
frahender
were
to
go
alone
to
meet
them
that
gave
her
several
hours
of
solitude
to
think
of
him
only
of
him
maurice
repeated
his
last
orders
for
the
engrossing
fête
against
which
he
railed
ceaselessly
in
spite
of
genevieve
constant
efforts
to
calm
him
oh
of
course
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
i
am
unreasonable
i
know
it
but
if
i
break
my
leg
slipping
on
an
orange
peel
you
would
not
prevent
me
from
swearing
at
the
person
who
had
peeled
the
fruit
there
would
you
genevieve
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
be
a
good
boy
tell
your
uncle
everything
as
soon
as
he
comes
but
say
nothing
against
esperance
for
that
would
not
be
right
her
lovely
face
was
very
sad
maurice
looked
at
her
with
a
world
of
tenderness
my
darling
forgive
me
the
truth
is
that
i
am
so
worried
albert
face
is
hard
and
set
he
knows
nothing
can
not
know
anything
but
he
is
gifted
with
the
intuition
that
simple
souls
often
possess
i
am
very
uneasy
i
can
tell
you
say
nothing
to
esperance
come
now
let
us
stroll
into
this
thicket
and
talk
just
by
ourselves
for
awhile
they
entered
the
thicket
holding
each
other
close
in
silence
when
they
came
to
the
clearing
they
stopped
short
the
duke
was
there
stretched
out
upon
the
bench
smoking
dreaming
he
got
up
surprised
and
apologized
i
had
just
come
back
here
to
live
over
an
unforgettable
moment
this
corner
must
be
the
rendezvous
for
the
slaves
of
the
little
god
said
maurice
bowing
to
the
statuette
of
we
will
leave
you
no
said
the
duke
quickly
please
stay
your
happiness
shows
me
the
vision
of
which
i
dreamed
art
is
the
inspiration
of
the
beautiful
and
i
believe
that
artists
have
a
more
delicate
sense
of
love
than
other
people
i
believe
in
truth
said
maurice
that
artists
move
in
a
much
larger
world
than
that
which
is
inhabited
by
either
the
bourgeoisie
or
the
aristocracy
they
talked
for
a
long
time
and
returned
to
the
château
together
albert
was
beneath
the
green
oak
talking
to
the
dowager
duchess
who
was
telling
him
how
much
she
admired
genevieve
she
had
repeated
her
poem
so
wonderfully
to
her
alone
that
morning
they
did
not
see
the
trio
emerge
from
the
thicket
and
maurice
was
glad
of
it
he
felt
more
and
more
constrained
the
complicity
against
the
poor
happiness
seemed
to
him
a
form
of
treason
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
only
five
that
is
impossible
this
watch
must
have
stopped
the
duke
went
to
his
room
his
man
gave
him
an
elegant
little
note
and
as
his
master
threw
it
down
on
the
table
they
await
an
answer
very
well
i
will
send
one
the
servant
withdrew
on
the
stair
he
met
an
english
maid
waiting
the
answer
monsieur
will
send
an
answer
the
countess
will
be
displeased
these
french
gentlemen
are
more
gallant
but
less
polite
than
our
english
lords
she
is
as
much
in
love
as
love
itself
he
also
is
in
love
then
it
ought
to
be
easy
enough
for
madame
is
a
widow
but
it
is
not
your
mistress
that
he
loves
ah
who
then
ah
nothing
for
nothing
and
he
held
out
his
hands
ah
shocking
very
well
and
he
started
as
if
to
return
to
his
master
she
stopped
him
monsieur
gustave
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
promised
nothing
for
nothing
again
he
held
out
his
hands
she
hesitated
a
moment
looking
up
and
down
and
then
let
him
have
her
finger
tips
with
a
brutal
gesture
he
caught
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
furiously
the
little
english
maid
blushing
and
rumpled
drew
back
and
announced
coldly
you
french
are
brutes
now
the
information
i
paid
for
in
advance
very
well
he
is
in
love
with
little
esperance
darbois
the
actress
but
she
is
engaged
to
count
styvens
it
is
the
truth
i
have
told
you
replied
the
valet
proud
of
his
own
importance
and
if
you
will
meet
me
in
the
grove
during
dinner
i
will
tell
you
some
more
thanks
i
know
enough
now
said
the
maid
dryly
leaving
him
she
disappeared
but
gustave
preened
himself
certain
of
success
as
he
went
downstairs
he
saw
count
albert
helping
the
old
mademoiselle
and
her
charge
into
the
carriage
instinctively
he
looked
up
to
see
his
master
silhouette
at
the
window
albert
was
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
with
them
but
esperance
had
promised
herself
a
quiet
and
restful
drive
no
albert
we
shall
be
four
with
my
father
and
mother
and
this
is
a
small
carriage
but
i
will
sit
with
the
coachman
look
said
the
young
girl
laughing
at
the
size
of
the
seat
and
remember
that
there
will
be
two
large
bags
and
a
hat
box
a
very
big
hat
box
to
hold
a
hat
for
mama
one
for
genevieve
and
one
for
me
albert
sighed
sadly
and
closed
the
carriage
door
after
he
had
kissed
his
fiancée
hand
as
the
carriage
drove
away
he
went
up
to
the
room
his
mother
was
to
occupy
when
she
arrived
next
day
and
looked
to
see
if
all
was
ready
he
took
a
book
and
tried
to
read
but
after
a
couple
of
minutes
he
threw
it
aside
and
went
out
of
doors
again
he
stopped
a
moment
on
the
terrace
considering
where
to
go
a
young
lady
stopped
him
as
he
was
preparing
to
go
down
the
steps
all
alone
count
and
dreaming
ah
you
are
thinking
of
her
come
let
us
stroll
along
together
and
the
young
countess
de
morgueil
took
his
arm
before
he
had
time
to
answer
you
were
not
at
the
rehearsal
this
morning
you
know
that
they
have
given
up
the
tableaux
of
did
you
insist
upon
it
no
why
should
i
have
made
myself
so
ridiculous
but
the
duke
pretended
dear
madame
the
duke
could
not
have
pretended
anything
except
that
he
did
not
wish
to
appear
without
any
clothes
on
a
decision
that
i
heartily
approved
of
they
say
that
he
tries
to
fascinate
every
woman
he
meets
what
do
you
think
and
what
do
you
said
the
count
looking
her
straight
in
the
eye
oh
he
would
never
cause
me
great
palpitation
she
returned
meaningly
are
you
making
any
allusion
to
mlle
darbois
he
asked
stopping
abruptly
i
am
engaged
to
mlle
darbois
i
believe
you
know
madame
you
are
piqued
because
you
love
the
duke
de
morlay
and
he
seems
to
be
deserting
you
to
hover
near
my
fiancée
do
as
i
do
have
a
little
patience
by
this
time
the
fête
will
be
over
and
i
shall
have
left
with
mlle
darbois
do
be
either
too
nervous
or
too
malicious
it
does
not
agree
with
your
type
of
beauty
i
kiss
your
hands
he
went
towards
the
château
and
took
up
his
vigil
in
the
little
salon
adjoining
esperance
room
the
countess
of
morgueil
was
confused
and
mortified
he
is
not
so
stupid
as
he
looks
she
thought
albert
was
reading
but
listening
all
the
time
finally
a
carriage
stopped
before
the
château
he
went
down
quickly
and
caught
esperance
in
his
arms
so
tightly
that
the
young
girl
gave
a
little
scream
oh
pardon
pardon
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
you
he
kissed
mme
darbois
hand
and
almost
crushed
the
fingers
in
his
nervous
grasp
he
asked
anxiously
concerning
penhouet
and
expressed
his
desire
to
return
there
immediately
maurice
and
genevieve
came
running
up
how
happy
every
one
looks
here
said
mme
darbois
do
believe
it
my
dear
aunt
we
are
standing
on
a
volcano
ah
the
cares
of
the
fête
weigh
upon
you
it
always
seems
as
if
everything
were
going
wrong
at
the
last
moment
she
laughed
proud
of
her
penetrations
genevieve
tugged
at
vest
as
he
was
about
to
set
the
dear
lady
right
ah
well
i
leave
you
to
dress
this
evening
uncle
i
want
to
have
a
chat
with
you
as
i
have
something
serious
to
say
to
you
the
philosopher
and
his
wife
looked
at
each
other
understandingly
very
well
my
boy
i
shall
be
entirely
at
your
disposal
for
as
long
as
you
like
for
i
can
guess
and
he
looked
at
genevieve
maurice
despaired
of
ever
making
him
understand
chapter
xxvi
everyone
greeted
the
philosopher
with
delight
when
he
appeared
in
the
where
the
guests
were
assembled
before
dinner
the
duke
came
to
present
his
greetings
to
mme
darbois
and
stayed
talking
to
her
for
some
time
he
saw
that
she
liked
him
but
foresaw
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
be
very
painful
for
the
good
woman
to
have
to
accept
another
during
dinner
the
duchess
steered
the
conversation
towards
philosophy
wishing
to
please
françois
who
was
placed
on
her
right
art
and
science
being
to
her
the
highest
titles
of
nobility
ah
i
am
no
philosopher
protested
the
marquis
de
montagnac
i
accept
old
age
only
as
a
chastisement
and
not
having
committed
any
criminal
act
i
revolt
against
the
injustice
of
it
and
louis
de
marset
bending
towards
his
neighbour
who
had
had
a
great
reputation
for
beauty
before
age
and
illness
had
pulled
her
down
remarked
one
can
not
be
and
have
been
is
not
that
true
madame
you
are
mistaken
my
dear
sir
there
are
some
poor
people
who
are
born
fools
and
never
change
a
smile
of
delight
appeared
on
every
face
the
duke
found
himself
in
an
argument
with
lord
glerey
a
phlegmatic
englishman
whose
marital
misfortunes
had
made
both
london
and
paris
laugh
you
seem
said
the
duke
to
confuse
indifference
with
philosophy
i
do
not
confuse
them
my
dear
sir
my
apparent
indifference
is
simply
scorn
for
the
sarcasms
the
cruelty
of
the
people
of
society
who
are
always
ready
to
rejoice
when
anyone
attacks
the
honour
or
love
of
another
the
duke
murmured
slowly
certainly
what
they
call
deserves
scorn
and
all
the
same
taken
separately
every
individual
of
this
collectivity
is
a
man
or
woman
like
any
other
a
suffering
being
who
laughs
just
the
same
like
an
eternal
figaro
for
fear
of
being
compelled
to
weep
count
albert
was
talking
to
an
old
sceptic
but
the
countess
de
morgueil
addressed
him
suddenly
what
would
you
do
if
on
the
eve
of
attaining
the
happiness
you
found
yourself
suddenly
confronted
by
an
insurmountable
obstacle
everything
would
depend
on
the
quality
of
the
happiness
in
prospect
madame
some
happiness
easily
abandoned
and
some
happiness
is
to
be
struggled
for
until
death
itself
maurice
had
guessed
the
point
of
this
sudden
attack
he
was
none
the
less
surprised
by
albert
answer
decidedly
it
is
going
to
be
even
more
difficult
than
i
feared
he
thought
indeed
count
albert
had
evidently
assumed
a
change
of
attitude
love
and
jealousy
had
transformed
this
simple
and
generous
heart
into
a
being
of
metal
he
had
not
lost
any
of
his
goodness
but
he
had
put
his
soul
in
a
state
of
defence
and
prepared
himself
for
the
struggle
he
did
not
know
anything
but
his
presentiments
filled
him
with
anguish
he
was
not
unaware
that
his
austerity
provoked
irony
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
irony
was
taking
a
form
of
pity
which
enraged
him
dinner
was
over
the
great
hall
filled
with
groups
gathered
together
as
their
tastes
dictated
bridge
and
poker
tables
were
produced
and
some
of
the
young
people
gathered
about
a
table
where
liqueurs
were
being
served
maurice
took
his
uncle
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
let
us
go
to
your
room
for
no
one
must
hear
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
not
even
your
aunt
no
uncle
not
even
aunt
françois
was
astonished
for
he
had
supposed
that
it
was
of
his
own
future
that
maurice
wished
to
speak
they
went
towards
the
tower
of
saint
genevieve
uncle
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
very
grave
what
a
lot
of
preamble
well
i
am
listening
the
duke
de
loves
esperance
passionately
well
that
is
a
pity
for
the
duke
but
he
will
console
himself
easily
enough
maurice
was
silent
before
he
continued
esperance
is
madly
in
love
with
the
duke
françois
started
violently
you
are
raving
maurice
she
is
engaged
to
count
styvens
and
has
no
right
to
forget
him
she
has
never
been
in
love
with
the
count
and
can
hardly
endure
him
since
she
has
foreseen
another
future
what
future
the
duke
wants
to
marry
esperance
but
it
is
impossible
impossible
said
the
philosopher
violently
a
word
that
has
been
given
can
not
be
taken
back
so
lightly
calm
yourself
uncle
if
you
please
for
three
days
i
have
been
wandering
about
in
this
untenable
situation
we
must
make
a
decision
every
instant
i
fear
an
outbreak
either
from
albert
or
from
the
duke
how
have
esperance
and
the
duke
contrived
to
see
each
other
i
will
tell
you
all
that
uncle
later
but
the
how
and
the
why
are
not
very
important
at
this
moment
i
want
you
to
send
for
albert
esperance
does
not
wish
to
marry
him
she
has
loved
the
duke
a
long
time
but
did
not
know
that
he
loved
her
and
did
not
suppose
an
alliance
possible
between
our
families
even
though
you
have
made
the
name
illustrious
for
that
matter
i
should
never
have
supposed
myself
that
the
duke
would
consent
to
make
what
would
generally
be
considered
a
mésalliance
it
all
seems
unbelievable
murmured
françois
and
with
his
head
in
his
hands
he
groaned
despairingly
how
can
we
sacrifice
that
noble
and
unfortunate
albert
one
of
the
three
must
suffer
uncle
it
would
be
a
crime
to
sacrifice
esperance
who
has
the
right
to
love
whom
she
pleases
and
to
choose
her
own
life
the
duke
morlay
is
loved
count
albert
is
not
and
never
has
been
he
knows
it
as
you
know
it
now
esperance
consented
to
marry
him
through
gratitude
to
you
ah
i
feared
as
much
said
the
professor
prostrated
françois
darbois
remained
a
long
time
in
thought
then
he
got
up
his
face
lined
with
sadness
tell
your
cousin
to
come
to
me
i
will
wait
for
her
here
i
will
send
her
to
you
at
once
forgive
me
for
having
so
distressed
you
dear
uncle
it
was
your
duty
françois
pressed
his
hand
affectionately
left
alone
he
felt
despairing
the
futility
of
the
precautions
he
had
taken
the
inanity
of
all
reasoning
of
all
logic
plunged
him
into
the
scepticism
he
had
been
combatting
for
so
many
years
maurice
found
his
cousin
talking
to
albert
the
marquis
of
montagnac
and
genevieve
your
father
is
feeling
a
little
indisposed
and
is
going
to
bed
would
not
you
like
to
say
to
him
esperance
rose
immediately
albert
wanted
to
go
with
her
but
maurice
held
him
back
and
began
asking
under
what
conditions
he
proposed
to
play
the
duet
with
esperance
next
day
it
is
all
one
to
me
replied
the
count
wearily
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
here
i
find
myself
too
much
disturbed
by
my
nerves
and
you
know
cousin
how
unusual
it
is
for
me
to
be
nervous
at
this
term
of
family
familiarity
maurice
shivered
he
thought
of
the
interview
now
taking
place
in
his
uncle
room
genevieve
joined
them
and
they
strolled
up
and
down
but
albert
made
them
return
continually
near
the
tower
when
esperance
opened
the
door
of
the
little
salon
where
her
father
was
waiting
she
saw
him
in
such
an
attitude
of
distress
that
she
threw
herself
at
his
knees
father
darling
father
i
ask
your
pardon
i
am
ruining
your
life
just
as
you
begin
to
reap
the
harvest
of
so
many
noble
efforts
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
she
sobbed
and
i
must
seem
to
you
so
ungrateful
do
not
suffer
so
i
beg
you
take
me
away
with
you
let
us
go
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
forget
let
us
go
but
said
the
professor
hesitatingly
albert
would
follow
the
girl
rose
oh
no
not
that
i
wish
i
could
marry
albert
without
loving
him
i
have
tried
but
i
can
not
go
on
to
the
end
i
can
not
you
really
love
the
duke
father
for
a
whole
year
i
have
struggled
against
that
love
why
have
you
never
told
me
because
i
saw
nothing
in
the
duke
attentions
except
the
agitation
they
caused
me
and
i
was
too
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
to
you
i
thought
considering
the
position
of
the
duke
that
i
was
an
aspiring
fool
he
overheard
me
talking
to
genevieve
when
he
appeared
before
us
i
so
little
expected
to
see
him
there
at
such
an
hour
six
in
the
morning
in
the
grove
that
my
heart
could
not
bear
the
shock
and
i
fainted
from
that
instant
i
understood
how
much
i
loved
him
i
had
no
idea
before
of
the
power
of
love
but
now
i
feel
it
the
master
of
my
life
i
will
sacrifice
that
to
your
will
father
but
i
will
not
sacrifice
the
immense
happiness
of
loving
even
if
the
duke
did
not
love
me
i
should
still
be
uplifted
by
my
own
love
she
sat
down
beside
her
father
who
knows
what
unhappiness
may
not
be
lurking
for
me
ready
to
spring
at
any
moment
she
drew
near
him
shivering
françois
took
her
charming
head
in
his
hands
he
looked
at
her
tenderly
but
with
an
expression
almost
of
terror
in
his
face
alas
all
happiness
built
upon
the
unhappiness
of
others
always
risks
disillusionment
and
collapse
dear
father
my
life
has
been
bathed
in
such
sunlight
for
the
last
three
days
that
i
shall
keep
that
glow
of
warmth
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
only
ask
you
little
daughter
to
do
nothing
to
say
nothing
before
the
end
of
this
fête
we
have
no
right
however
grave
our
personal
troubles
and
responsibilities
are
to
betray
the
hospitality
of
the
duchess
after
the
fête
i
will
talk
to
albert
go
my
darling
go
back
to
that
poor
boy
i
hate
to
send
you
to
practice
a
dissimulation
that
i
abhor
but
we
are
in
a
situation
of
such
delicacy
and
difficulty
god
keep
you
he
kissed
her
tenderly
she
went
back
to
her
fiancé
to
find
to
her
surprise
that
the
countess
de
morgueil
had
just
passed
by
with
him
maurice
pointed
them
out
where
they
were
walking
slowly
in
the
distance
oh
so
much
the
better
said
esperance
that
gives
me
an
excuse
to
go
to
my
room
maurice
urged
her
to
wait
i
am
convinced
that
that
woman
is
meddling
in
our
affairs
it
is
plain
enough
that
we
have
upset
her
how
what
do
you
mean
cousin
did
you
not
know
that
the
countess
is
madly
in
love
with
the
duke
and
that
she
had
hoped
to
marry
him
this
winter
poor
woman
sighed
esperance
sincerely
the
duke
came
by
and
seeing
them
alone
he
joined
them
the
three
of
you
alone
he
cried
then
you
will
allow
me
to
join
you
for
a
moment
look
said
maurice
indicating
albert
and
the
countess
de
morgueil
there
is
a
dangerous
woman
who
is
making
mischief
at
this
moment
and
nevertheless
i
owe
her
the
happiness
this
moment
brings
me
my
father
said
esperance
has
been
as
indulgent
to
me
as
always
thanks
for
these
tidings
said
the
duke
do
you
think
he
will
receive
me
if
i
go
to
him
oh
certainly
after
the
fête
a
little
while
after
for
first
he
wished
to
speak
to
count
styvens
she
said
timidly
will
you
the
duke
asked
maurice
make
an
appointment
for
me
and
tell
me
as
soon
as
you
have
an
answer
with
pleasure
the
duke
bowed
to
the
girls
and
withdrew
he
took
maurice
hand
i
am
happy
my
friend
everything
is
going
as
i
wish
i
seem
to
hear
laughter
coming
out
of
the
shadows
and
he
disappeared
the
young
people
waited
for
albert
a
little
while
longer
but
as
he
did
not
appear
maurice
advised
the
girls
to
retire
and
he
returned
to
sit
down
anxiously
under
the
oak
he
had
been
there
hardly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
saw
the
countess
de
morgueil
go
by
she
was
alone
and
walked
nervously
on
the
doorstep
she
stopped
and
looked
back
into
the
distance
he
saw
her
tremble
then
go
in
quickly
he
stood
up
on
his
bench
to
see
what
she
had
been
looking
at
but
he
almost
fell
and
had
to
steady
himself
by
holding
on
to
a
branch
albert
and
the
duke
were
together
albert
had
put
his
hand
on
the
duke
shoulder
and
the
duke
had
removed
that
great
hand
they
were
walking
side
by
side
towards
the
extensive
terrace
that
commanded
the
countryside
oh
the
wretched
woman
what
can
she
have
said
and
to
be
able
to
do
nothing
nothing
he
thought
he
lighted
a
cigarette
waiting
he
did
not
know
for
what
but
he
could
not
go
back
to
his
room
as
he
put
his
hand
on
the
duke
shoulder
albert
had
said
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
very
well
i
am
listening
i
want
you
to
answer
me
with
perfect
truth
your
request
would
be
offensive
albert
if
it
were
not
for
your
emotion
is
it
true
that
you
love
esperance
darbois
it
is
true
is
it
true
that
you
want
to
marry
her
it
is
true
my
god
my
god
muttered
albert
and
he
stopped
for
a
minute
he
was
choking
the
duke
felt
a
profound
pity
for
this
man
who
was
suffering
at
this
moment
the
most
terrible
pain
do
you
believe
that
she
loves
you
albert
still
went
on
i
have
answered
you
with
perfect
frankness
concerning
myself
but
do
not
ask
me
to
answer
for
mlle
darbois
yes
you
are
right
you
can
not
answer
for
her
i
know
that
she
does
not
love
me
but
i
hoped
to
make
her
love
me
i
wanted
to
make
her
so
happy
that
love
has
made
a
different
man
of
me
what
i
regarded
yesterday
as
a
crime
seems
to
me
now
the
will
of
destiny
one
of
us
two
must
disappear
if
you
kill
me
i
know
her
soul
she
will
not
marry
you
she
would
die
rather
if
i
kill
you
the
tender
compassion
she
feels
for
me
will
be
changed
into
hatred
what
i
am
doing
now
is
a
brutal
act
an
animal
act
but
i
can
not
do
otherwise
my
religious
education
had
restrained
my
passions
at
least
i
thought
so
he
said
passing
his
great
hand
across
his
stubborn
forehead
but
no
my
youth
denied
of
love
takes
a
terrible
revenge
upon
me
now
and
i
have
to
exert
a
horrible
effort
now
not
to
strangle
you
the
duke
had
not
stirred
i
am
at
your
orders
albert
only
i
think
you
will
have
to
arm
yourself
with
patience
for
several
hours
longer
this
fête
given
by
the
duchess
can
not
be
prevented
by
our
quarrel
i
suggest
that
you
postpone
our
meeting
until
evening
our
witnesses
can
meet
if
you
like
at
one
at
the
little
inn
of
the
roads
it
is
only
ten
minutes
distance
from
here
the
innkeeper
is
loyal
to
me
i
am
his
daughter
godfather
the
garden
is
cut
by
a
long
alley
which
can
serve
as
the
field
of
honour
i
will
go
at
once
to
warn
de
montagnac
and
his
brother
then
i
will
go
to
the
roads
good
said
albert
naturally
we
leave
maurice
renaud
out
of
our
quarrel
certainly
said
charles
de
morlay
bowing
they
parted
from
a
distance
the
young
painter
saw
the
duke
enter
the
great
hall
several
minutes
later
albert
tall
form
barred
the
horizon
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
the
tower
of
saint
genevieve
then
he
also
entered
the
hall
then
maurice
decided
to
go
in
himself
he
sat
down
by
a
little
table
littered
with
magazines
and
periodicals
and
picked
up
one
without
ceasing
for
an
instant
to
watch
the
two
men
the
duke
de
morlay
was
standing
behind
the
marquis
who
was
still
at
the
whist
table
albert
styvens
had
sat
down
beside
a
diplomat
from
italy
cesar
gabrielli
a
serious
young
man
a
clever
diplomat
and
a
renowned
fencer
when
montagnac
finished
his
hand
the
duke
offered
him
a
cigar
will
you
help
me
with
some
arrangements
for
the
performance
he
was
about
to
refuse
but
the
duke
said
briefly
it
is
important
come
the
two
of
them
went
out
only
lingering
a
little
on
the
way
for
a
joke
with
the
men
and
a
compliment
to
the
ladies
then
maurice
watched
the
diplomat
who
rose
at
the
same
time
and
invited
albert
to
admire
the
moon
from
the
terrace
maurice
saw
them
disappearing
towards
the
corner
by
the
chinese
umbrella
that
was
the
end
of
the
terrace
and
was
out
of
sight
from
all
the
windows
it
is
all
plain
enough
thought
the
young
man
but
when
where
he
understood
that
neither
of
the
two
adversaries
could
take
him
either
for
confidant
or
for
second
however
he
said
as
he
went
to
his
room
i
want
to
know
i
must
know
i
will
know
chapter
xxvii
the
next
day
the
day
of
the
fête
all
the
château
from
early
in
the
morning
was
in
a
violent
tumult
maurice
the
marquis
assistant
and
jean
perliez
were
busy
to
the
point
of
distraction
fortunately
for
maurice
who
had
been
unable
to
sleep
and
had
called
jean
at
six
to
share
the
secret
which
had
not
been
confided
to
him
he
could
not
think
of
telling
genevieve
and
jean
should
be
able
to
help
keep
watch
you
try
he
directed
to
watch
montagnac
i
shall
not
leave
the
diplomat
the
duke
came
in
search
of
maurice
to
ask
for
esperance
he
looked
a
little
pale
but
showed
much
interest
in
the
fête
our
dear
duchess
must
be
rewarded
for
all
the
excitement
we
have
caused
her
house
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
said
maurice
that
all
the
excitement
will
cease
after
the
fête
the
duke
would
not
show
that
he
had
understood
maurice
went
to
smoke
a
cigarette
in
the
garden
and
was
hardly
surprised
to
see
the
doctor
who
had
been
attached
to
the
service
of
the
duchess
for
twenty
years
and
attended
all
the
guests
in
the
château
talking
animatedly
with
the
diplomat
the
doctor
raised
his
arms
in
a
horrified
gesture
letting
them
fall
again
tragically
he
gave
every
evidence
of
a
violent
struggle
with
himself
the
diplomat
remained
calm
determined
and
even
authoritative
the
poor
doctor
finally
yielded
the
diplomat
shook
his
hand
and
left
him
the
doctor
with
an
expression
of
great
distress
walking
feebly
passed
by
maurice
who
would
have
stopped
him
no
no
what
it
is
impossible
you
are
not
ill
leave
me
dear
sir
i
i
must
he
stammered
unintelligible
phrases
hastening
his
steps
maurice
the
hall
he
met
the
musician
xavier
flamand
who
said
i
just
saw
the
count
styvens
go
out
at
this
hour
exclaimed
montagnac
looking
at
the
duke
he
has
gone
to
meet
his
mother
at
the
station
she
arrives
at
eight
it
is
only
seven
he
will
arrive
half
an
hour
too
soon
he
is
a
dutiful
son
said
montagnac
i
am
surprised
that
he
has
not
taken
his
fiancée
maurice
raised
his
head
then
the
marquis
knows
nothing
he
said
to
himself
he
reflected
how
dense
i
am
growing
evidently
neither
the
duke
nor
albert
has
told
anyone
the
motive
of
their
quarrel
jean
came
up
and
cut
short
his
monologue
i
think
that
the
two
other
seconds
are
count
alfred
montagnac
the
marquis
brother
and
captain
frederic
chevalier
here
they
come
now
indeed
the
three
seconds
had
just
come
up
to
the
marquis
who
asked
maurice
to
excuse
him
i
will
be
back
in
a
few
moments
dear
m
renaud
the
duke
dropped
down
by
maurice
i
believe
the
fête
will
be
a
great
success
but
i
wonder
if
you
long
to
have
it
over
as
heartily
as
i
do
i
regret
replied
maurice
that
our
hostess
ever
thought
of
it
and
that
we
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
it
would
you
also
regret
having
me
for
your
cousin
no
you
know
very
well
that
i
would
not
but
but
i
know
you
know
yes
i
know
who
has
told
you
the
duke
face
grew
stern
no
one
i
give
you
my
word
but
i
have
guessed
it
was
not
very
difficult
then
my
dear
maurice
i
must
ask
you
to
remain
absolutely
silent
none
of
our
seconds
know
the
real
reason
of
our
meeting
none
of
them
will
ever
know
this
duel
will
be
to
the
death
by
the
wish
of
count
styvens
who
has
found
himself
justifiably
offended
where
will
you
meet
at
the
inn
of
the
roads
when
immediately
after
the
fête
the
inn
has
been
closed
since
this
morning
so
as
to
receive
no
one
except
ourselves
and
our
witnesses
now
my
dear
maurice
since
you
know
i
want
to
ask
you
a
favour
here
are
some
papers
that
i
wrote
last
night
i
am
afraid
my
servant
is
on
intimate
terms
with
mme
de
morgueil
english
maid
and
i
dare
not
leave
them
in
my
room
i
put
them
in
your
care
if
luck
is
against
me
you
will
give
these
to
the
proper
persons
if
count
albert
is
unfortunate
you
will
give
me
back
the
envelope
i
see
you
later
he
pressed
the
young
man
hand
in
a
close
grasp
the
duke
de
the
dowager
only
son
had
been
chosen
by
the
seconds
as
umpire
de
morlay
and
styvens
approved
the
choice
the
great
hall
had
been
invaded
by
a
score
of
servants
who
arranged
the
chairs
placed
the
palms
and
hung
silver
chains
to
separate
the
musicians
from
the
audience
the
curtain
of
the
little
stage
was
lowered
but
a
murmur
could
be
heard
through
the
pretty
drop
painted
by
maurice
among
the
servants
set
to
finish
the
costumes
was
the
duke
sly
goddaughter
every
time
the
duke
passed
she
gazed
at
him
and
her
lips
trembled
she
who
was
usually
so
pert
and
smiling
worked
with
set
lips
ha
ha
said
one
of
the
maids
you
must
be
in
love
eh
jeanette
let
me
alone
stupid
to
do
my
work
said
the
young
girl
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
had
been
waked
the
night
before
by
the
noise
of
opening
doors
she
had
got
up
and
seen
her
godfather
talking
to
her
father
the
duke
said
you
must
close
your
inn
early
as
possible
you
must
refuse
everybody
except
the
doctor
from
the
château
count
styvens
and
four
gentlemen
with
the
duke
of
i
shall
probably
get
here
first
ah
my
god
the
innkeeper
had
murmured
the
duke
is
going
to
fight
i
know
that
if
only
nothing
happens
to
you
sir
i
need
not
say
that
i
count
on
your
discretion
as
on
your
devotion
have
your
best
bedroom
ready
to
receive
one
or
the
other
of
the
adversaries
and
put
yourself
at
the
absolute
command
of
the
duke
de
try
not
to
let
your
daughter
know
anything
about
this
and
say
nothing
to
her
but
i
know
that
even
if
she
discovered
she
would
not
give
us
away
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
jeanette
ran
to
her
father
her
hair
flying
just
as
she
had
jumped
out
of
bed
great
heavens
said
the
innkeeper
you
were
listening
yes
i
was
listening
i
heard
i
will
prepare
the
room
but
it
shall
be
for
the
other
do
you
know
who
the
other
is
no
she
said
quickly
do
you
know
why
they
are
fighting
how
should
i
know
she
demanded
she
did
know
however
however
she
sat
mute
under
the
gibes
of
the
other
servants
albert
had
returned
with
his
mother
who
seemed
gayer
happier
than
usual
esperance
went
at
once
to
speak
to
her
and
was
enthusiastically
congratulated
on
her
superb
bearing
the
countess
kissed
esperance
whose
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
and
she
kissed
the
countess
hands
with
so
much
emotion
that
the
lady
raised
the
blonde
head
saying
tenderly
no
no
you
must
not
cry
we
must
love
each
other
joyfully
i
have
never
seen
my
son
so
happy
i
should
be
jealous
if
i
loved
him
less
see
dear
i
want
to
give
you
these
jewels
myself
i
believe
that
they
are
going
to
suit
you
very
well
she
clasped
a
magnificent
collar
of
pearls
around
the
young
neck
esperance
could
not
refuse
them
she
thanked
the
lovely
lady
affectionately
my
father
will
tell
me
what
to
do
she
thought
lunch
was
an
hour
earlier
as
the
fête
was
to
begin
at
two
heavens
said
mme
styvens
with
perturbation
i
shall
never
be
ready
esperance
left
her
happy
to
escape
from
her
torturing
thoughts
deceit
deceit
to
this
good
woman
albert
was
waiting
to
lead
her
back
he
admired
his
mother
gift
and
spoke
to
her
gently
it
is
just
the
tint
of
your
skin
he
said
that
gives
these
pearls
their
beautiful
lustre
they
ought
not
to
flatter
themselves
that
it
is
they
who
embellish
you
all
this
was
added
anguish
for
the
girl
his
mother
kindness
albert
gay
confidence
and
this
fête
which
was
soon
to
begin
this
fête
where
she
must
show
herself
publicly
with
him
whom
she
loved
so
that
she
would
die
for
him
with
him
who
loved
her
more
than
life
she
repulsed
with
horror
the
ideas
that
came
crowding
into
her
brain
if
the
château
should
burn
if
she
should
fall
down
the
staircase
and
break
a
leg
if
albert
should
be
taken
ill
and
die
within
the
hour
if
if
and
a
million
visions
raced
through
her
brain
as
she
went
back
to
the
tower
of
saint
genevieve
but
never
once
did
the
duke
appear
as
a
victim
of
any
of
these
misfortunes
which
her
brain
was
conjecturing
up
so
busily
lunch
was
a
bit
disorganized
the
duke
avoided
looking
at
esperance
the
sight
of
that
child
who
loved
him
filled
him
with
such
emotion
that
he
was
afraid
of
betraying
himself
the
countess
de
morgueil
annoyed
at
seeing
the
two
men
she
had
sought
to
embroil
talking
together
in
the
most
courteous
fashion
started
to
sharpen
her
claws
once
more
what
a
beautiful
collar
mlle
darbois
this
is
the
first
time
that
you
have
worn
it
is
it
count
i
compliment
you
mme
styvens
has
just
given
it
to
me
the
duke
understood
the
embarrassment
the
child
felt
not
yet
eighteen
and
forced
to
extricate
herself
from
nets
set
by
such
expert
hands
as
best
she
could
at
two
the
great
hall
was
crowded
by
women
vying
with
each
other
in
their
beauty
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
xavier
flamand
went
to
his
stand
to
conduct
the
orchestra
he
was
heartily
applauded
and
the
spectacle
commenced
more
than
two
thousand
people
had
come
together
for
the
fête
the
hall
could
only
accommodate
eight
hundred
other
chairs
had
been
placed
on
the
terrace
the
tableaux
began
the
society
assembled
appreciated
a
form
of
art
which
is
pleasing
and
not
fatiguing
which
charms
without
disturbing
the
tableau
of
andromeda
was
frantically
applauded
the
men
could
not
admire
enough
the
suppleness
of
esperance
lovely
body
the
whiteness
of
her
bare
feet
with
their
pink
arches
the
gold
of
her
hair
floating
like
a
nimbus
around
the
head
of
andromeda
waved
by
the
breeze
as
the
stage
turned
the
women
admired
the
duke
so
very
beautiful
in
his
gold
and
silver
armour
how
splendid
the
duke
is
remarked
the
countess
to
albert
no
one
could
have
a
prouder
bearing
if
i
were
in
your
place
my
son
i
should
be
jealous
perhaps
i
am
said
the
count
smiling
the
judgment
of
paris
had
the
same
success
everyone
waited
for
europa
and
many
were
really
disappointed
a
hundred
reasons
were
given
for
its
withdrawal
and
none
of
them
the
true
one
the
philosopher
and
his
wife
were
sitting
with
genevieve
behind
the
styvens
sometimes
the
countess
would
turn
around
to
compliment
françois
and
the
unfortunate
man
so
frank
whose
whole
life
had
never
known
deceit
suffered
cruelly
there
was
an
intermission
to
set
the
stage
for
the
concert
the
guests
pressed
around
the
styvens
to
express
their
admiration
for
esperance
in
the
most
dithyrambic
the
most
superlative
terms
the
concert
began
albert
had
to
go
upon
the
stage
to
play
the
liszt
duet
with
esperance
he
begged
françois
darbois
to
take
his
place
beside
his
mother
when
the
curtain
went
up
after
the
quartette
of
rigoletto
esperance
and
albert
were
seated
on
the
long
piano
stool
loud
applause
greeted
them
the
duke
was
talking
to
maurice
in
the
wings
and
seemed
a
little
nervous
he
envied
albert
at
that
moment
for
his
superiority
as
a
musician
when
they
finished
a
great
tumult
demanded
an
encore
but
esperance
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
strength
as
the
public
continued
to
applaud
maurice
and
the
duke
came
forward
to
see
why
they
did
not
raise
the
curtain
esperance
looked
at
the
duke
oh
no
please
do
not
raise
the
curtain
my
heart
is
beating
so
fast
albert
and
the
duke
supported
her
gently
and
she
leaned
upon
them
her
pretty
head
bending
towards
the
duke
i
feel
confused
and
she
closed
her
eyes
afraid
of
giving
herself
away
once
more
in
the
air
and
she
began
to
feel
better
she
breathed
the
little
flask
of
ether
that
the
doctor
held
under
her
nose
this
poor
heart
is
always
making
scenes
ah
dear
count
you
will
have
to
set
that
in
order
the
duke
had
moved
away
annoyed
by
the
insistence
of
the
public
he
told
jean
perliez
to
announce
that
mlle
darbois
needed
a
little
rest
and
presented
her
compliments
to
the
audience
and
excused
herself
from
replying
to
the
encoring
this
was
a
real
disappointment
there
had
been
such
enthusiasm
for
the
two
fiancés
an
enthusiasm
by
the
inspired
execution
of
orpheus
that
the
attitude
of
this
elite
audience
was
a
little
indifferent
to
the
artists
who
concluded
the
concert
the
hall
was
half
empty
and
several
artists
were
too
offended
to
appear
esperance
went
to
her
room
with
her
mother
and
genevieve
begging
the
count
to
return
to
his
mother
your
mother
will
be
anxious
and
my
father
can
not
reassure
her
because
he
does
not
himself
know
the
symptoms
of
this
slight
illness
tell
them
that
i
will
rest
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
join
you
at
my
flower
booth
when
she
was
left
alone
with
genevieve
she
drew
her
friend
to
her
my
dear
little
sister
i
can
not
tell
you
the
joy
that
pervades
every
part
of
my
being
in
an
hour
it
will
be
over
my
father
will
talk
with
albert
and
i
shall
be
free
free
poor
boy
sighed
genevieve
oh
yes
i
am
ungrateful
to
his
great
devotion
but
i
should
be
false
to
myself
and
to
you
genevieve
if
i
told
you
that
the
idea
of
his
despair
greatly
troubles
me
i
know
that
every
one
about
me
regrets
the
breaking
off
of
this
marriage
and
still
i
do
care
you
all
admire
the
duke
but
you
blame
him
a
little
i
know
that
but
that
is
all
submerged
and
forgotten
in
my
great
love
when
i
reason
as
i
do
now
i
recognize
at
once
the
horrible
storm
i
am
causing
and
yet
i
can
not
feel
sad
i
find
all
sorts
of
excuses
for
myself
and
cast
back
all
the
responsibility
on
fate
she
was
silent
an
instant
do
you
think
it
will
take
vengeance
mlle
frahender
came
in
what
will
take
vengeance
fate
my
dear
child
what
is
called
fate
is
simply
the
law
of
god
then
if
god
is
just
he
will
not
avenge
himself
for
what
has
happened
is
not
my
fault
the
old
lady
looked
at
the
young
girl
very
tenderly
my
dear
child
do
not
get
into
the
habit
of
throwing
the
responsibility
of
your
actions
upon
others
certainly
we
are
not
responsible
for
events
but
we
can
almost
always
choose
the
way
to
meet
them
only
some
flatter
their
passions
and
refuse
to
assert
themselves
against
them
this
weakness
opens
the
door
to
all
other
concessions
and
then
it
becomes
difficult
to
make
a
loyal
examination
of
our
conscience
is
that
my
case
asked
the
young
girl
with
some
anxiety
perhaps
replied
mlle
frahender
frankly
oh
little
lady
be
kinder
to
me
i
am
so
happy
that
i
can
not
believe
such
happiness
comes
from
troubled
waters
and
i
swear
to
you
that
my
heart
is
loyal
the
old
lady
kissed
her
charge
but
her
smile
was
sad
esperance
was
now
ready
to
go
to
her
flower
stall
a
pretty
dress
toned
like
a
pigeon
breast
a
round
neck
with
a
tulle
collar
a
wide
girdle
fastened
with
a
bunch
of
primroses
a
flapping
hat
of
italian
straw
tied
with
two
narrow
ribbons
under
her
chin
created
a
delightful
effect
and
a
ravishing
frame
for
her
lovely
face
when
she
passed
lightly
on
her
way
to
her
booth
she
caused
quite
a
sensation
the
duke
count
albert
maurice
and
jean
perliez
were
waiting
for
her
a
crowd
followed
in
her
wake
the
duke
and
count
had
the
same
longing
to
see
her
to
be
with
her
up
to
the
last
moment
they
understood
each
other
at
that
instant
and
each
outdid
the
other
in
courtesy
albert
was
the
first
customer
passing
a
thousand
francs
for
a
primrose
from
her
belt
the
duke
made
the
same
bargain
the
girl
fingers
trembled
as
she
handed
him
the
flower
albert
felt
a
choking
feeling
in
his
throat
the
crowd
pressed
round
a
german
offered
ten
thousand
francs
for
a
flower
which
the
young
girl
had
put
to
her
lips
at
last
albert
could
work
off
some
of
his
emotion
he
repulsed
the
german
there
is
nothing
more
for
sale
sir
i
have
just
bought
everything
for
fifty
thousand
francs
the
german
would
have
protested
but
he
was
pushed
back
by
the
crowd
and
landed
at
a
distance
that
was
well
done
i
did
not
know
that
he
could
be
so
impulsive
he
was
quite
right
the
poor
people
of
the
duchess
will
become
landholders
and
the
crowd
scattered
making
many
comments
on
the
way
albert
was
soon
surrounded
as
everybody
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
him
the
duke
had
stepped
back
behind
the
booth
esperance
came
out
with
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
he
stopped
beside
her
a
moment
i
love
you
oh
thank
you
forever
i
hope
then
as
he
saw
that
the
count
was
still
surrounded
and
that
esperance
would
not
be
able
to
make
her
way
to
him
he
offered
her
his
arm
let
me
take
you
to
count
styvens
who
can
not
extricate
himself
with
the
help
of
jean
and
maurice
he
dispersed
the
guests
and
led
esperance
to
her
fiancée
at
that
moment
anyone
who
had
suspected
the
duke
of
intentions
to
flirt
with
the
plighted
girl
must
have
abandoned
their
idea
and
the
motive
of
the
duel
which
was
to
bring
one
of
these
two
perfect
gentlemen
to
his
death
became
more
and
more
obscure
count
styvens
saw
the
girl
coming
to
him
on
the
duke
arm
and
he
did
not
suffer
from
the
sight
his
suffering
for
the
last
two
days
had
been
too
extreme
to
feel
upset
by
any
increase
he
took
esperance
to
the
door
of
the
tower
you
were
lovelier
than
ever
before
he
kissed
her
fingers
devotedly
the
young
girl
felt
a
tiny
tear
fall
like
a
terrible
weight
on
her
hand
he
lifted
his
head
quickly
looked
fixedly
at
esperance
with
a
look
of
such
goodness
and
faith
that
she
felt
suddenly
guilty
and
bent
her
head
the
count
shook
hands
cordially
with
the
philosopher
do
not
forget
the
elder
man
said
to
him
that
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
it
is
more
than
a
wish
it
is
a
duty
i
also
have
a
serious
duty
to
attend
to
replied
the
young
count
excuse
me
if
i
have
to
keep
you
waiting
chapter
xxviii
albert
went
immediately
to
his
mother
who
was
taking
tea
with
the
princess
he
embraced
her
with
such
tenderness
that
she
was
astonished
at
his
ardour
the
princess
held
out
her
hand
do
not
wait
too
long
to
realize
your
happiness
albert
you
know
how
all
your
friends
will
rejoice
with
you
he
kissed
her
hand
again
and
went
to
join
his
two
seconds
at
the
gate
of
the
kitchen
garden
the
crowd
had
all
dispersed
to
catch
the
last
train
the
meeting
at
the
three
roads
was
for
seven
they
saw
the
duke
de
from
a
distance
he
had
had
some
difficulty
in
making
his
escape
having
had
to
help
his
mother
the
duchess
with
the
last
farewells
he
bowed
to
the
count
and
led
the
way
by
a
little
door
to
the
inn
stable
he
was
carrying
two
sets
of
swords
done
up
in
two
cases
of
green
cloth
the
duke
and
his
seconds
were
already
there
only
the
doctor
had
not
arrived
and
albert
bowed
to
each
other
and
got
ready
the
little
bowers
where
the
of
the
inn
often
ate
their
midday
meals
served
them
as
the
doctor
arrived
out
of
breath
with
the
information
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
and
would
have
to
serve
both
sides
the
umpire
in
company
with
the
seconds
chose
an
alley
of
proper
dimensions
the
adversaries
were
placed
opposite
sword
in
hand
the
duke
de
touched
the
points
of
their
swords
and
said
go
the
conditions
of
the
duel
were
very
strict
the
first
round
should
last
three
minutes
should
neither
of
the
adversaries
be
touched
halt
cried
the
duke
de
one
minute
was
allowed
them
to
breathe
go
said
the
umpire
again
joining
the
sword
tips
this
time
albert
made
a
furious
drive
against
the
duke
there
was
a
moment
of
suspense
the
duke
did
not
give
way
his
arm
shot
out
and
the
unfortunate
count
turned
completely
round
and
fell
charles
de
morlay
sword
had
pierced
beneath
the
right
arm
pit
entering
the
lung
the
blood
streamed
from
the
wounded
man
mouth
the
doctor
and
the
seconds
carried
him
into
the
room
which
jeanette
had
prepared
the
duke
sorely
moved
followed
them
albert
saw
him
and
held
out
a
hand
which
the
duke
pressed
gently
bending
his
head
the
count
signed
to
the
seconds
to
withdraw
i
was
wrong
duke
he
murmured
my
love
had
blinded
my
wisdom
with
the
heavy
mask
of
egoism
on
the
threshold
of
eternity
the
truth
seems
clearer
forgive
me
de
morlay
as
i
forgive
you
he
choked
the
doctor
came
forward
the
duke
as
pale
as
the
dying
man
pressed
that
loyal
hand
for
the
last
time
and
withdrew
in
her
own
room
esperance
had
just
waked
with
an
anguished
cry
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
i
i
do
not
know
a
catastrophe
where
is
my
father
in
his
room
and
at
that
very
moment
maurice
knocked
at
the
door
and
before
they
had
time
to
answer
him
he
entered
his
face
was
distorted
with
grief
a
catastrophe

catastrophe
repeated
esperance
at

of
him

a
wrap

albert
the
duke

he
answered
brusquely
come

wants
to

before
the
words
died
in
his
throat
he
helped
his
cousin
and
led
her
rapidly
to
the
carriage
esperance
was
gasping
with
anguish
tell
me
maurice
tell
me
but
the
young
man
could
not
answer
he
knew
only
that
albert
was
mortally
wounded
he
had
been
waiting
a
few
paces
from
the
inn
to
see
the
duellers
come
out
the
duke
de
and
appeared
first
and
as
they
were
talking
to
the
young
man
the
marquis
de
montagnac
came
out
precipitately
i
beg
you
he
said
to
maurice
to
fetch
the
count
fiancée
he
wants
to
see
her
before
his
mother
knows
and
maurice
had
departed
in
hot
haste
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
inn
esperance
jumped
to
the
ground
jeanette
who
had
kept
a
constant
watch
ran
along
ahead
of
her
and
without
a
word
showed
her
the
door
of
the
room
where
count
albert
lay
dying
the
doctor
stopped
her
very
gently
he
said
but
albert
had
felt
the
presence
of
his
dearly
loved
he
raised
himself
a
little
holding
out
his
great
arms
to
the
young
girl
come

be
afraid

only
a
few
minutes
to
live

one

the
real
reason
of
my
quarrel
with
the
duke
you
may
have
thought
that
it
was
about
you
i
swear
to
you
he
laid
stress
on
the
word
i
swear
to
you
that
it
was
nothing
to
do
with
you
his
glazing
eyes
cleared
for
an
instant
illuminated
by
the
beauty
of
his
falsehood
marry
the
duke
he
is
charming
he
he
is
loyal
but
do
not
abandon
my
mother

will
have
only
you
two
red
streams
trickled
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
esperance
on
her
knees
with
her
hands
crossed
on
the
bed
watched
the
blood
run
down
on
the
face
that
had
grown
paler
than
the
pillow
her
tears
blinded
her
and
she
shook
as
with
an
ague
albert
ceased
breathing
for
an
instant
the
doctor
who
was
watching
closely
from
the
end
of
the
room
came
near
and
gave
him
a
dose
of
chlorate
of
calcium
to
stop
the
hemorrhage
then
at
a
sign
from
albert
withdrew
again
promise
me

the
young
man
that

always

the
door
opened
and
the
countess
suddenly
awakened
entered
with
the
baron
van
berger
and
the
duke
de
mother
dear
mother

place

the
duke

morlay

pain

has
caused

our
quarrel
was
so
deep
we
could
only
settle
it
by
arms
it
was
i
i
who
precipitated
matters
the
duke
acted
like
an
honourable
gentleman
oh
do
not
weep
mother
do
not
weep
he
raised
his
hand
painfully
to
wipe
with
trembling
fingers
the
tears
burning
the
beautiful
eyes
that
had
already
wept
so
much
the
chaplain
from
the
château
entered
the
room
bearing
the
holy
sacrament
he
was
accompanied
by
the
dowager
duchess
the
prince
and
princess
of
bernecourt
a
solemn
hush
quieted
the
sobs
of
the
two
women
the
priest
bent
over
the
couch
of
the
dying
man
the
count
summoned
all
his
strength
to
receive
the
extreme
unction
then
transfigured
by
his
faith
he
sat
up
extending
his
arms
the
two
women
threw
themselves
trembling
into
the
open
arms
which
closed
upon
them
in
the
last
struggle
of
life
they
remained
there
imprisoned
not
knowing
that
the
soul
had
fled
a
terrible
cry
shook
these
souls
sunk
down
in
grief
esperance
shrieked
these
arms
these
arms
loosen
these
arms
which
are
strangling
me
deliver
me
deliver
me
from
these
arms
i
am
choking
they
had
some
difficulty
in
freeing
her
her
pupils
dilated
by
terror
she
was
hardly
able
to
breathe
the
doctor
did
not
disguise
his
anxiety
save
her
doctor
said
the
countess
styvens
save
my
daughter
my
son
is
now
with
god
he
sees
me
he
waits
for
me
but
i
must
obey
his
last
wish
they
carried
esperance
away
unconscious
without
tears
without
movement
almost
without
life
françois
who
had
just
arrived
with
his
wife
learned
of
the
frightful
tragedy
and
received
in
his
arms
the
poor
unconscious
cause
of
the
drama
mme
darbois
did
not
wish
to
leave
her
daughter
but
the
philosopher
insisted
until
she
could
not
refuse
that
she
should
go
back
to
the
countess
styvens
when
the
professor
arrived
at
the
château
he
found
the
duke
de
morlay
at
the
gate
waiting
for
tidings
at
sight
of
esperance
unconscious
her
head
fallen
back
on
her
father
breast
he
jumped
on
the
step
of
the
victoria
what
more
has
happened
he
asked
panting
the
doctor
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
he
will
tell
you
the
carriage
drove
on
to
the
tower
of
saint
genevieve
the
duke
took
the
poor
figure
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
up
to
her
room
followed
by
françois
darbois
broken
by
sorrow
genevieve
was
waiting
feverishly
for
the
return
of
maurice
and
esperance
she
showed
the
duke
where
to
lay
esperance
he
stretched
the
slender
creature
on
her
bed
her
eyes
were
open
but
she
recognized
no
one
the
rigidity
of
her
expression
frightened
the
duke
and
he
bent
in
terror
to
listen
to
her
breathing
a
faint
burning
breath
touched
his
face
the
doctor
declared
that
he
could
give
no
decision
at
that
moment
and
ordered
them
to
leave
her
to
sleep
she
must
not
be
left
for
a
second
he
said
two
people
must
watch
so
that
she
need
never
be
left
alone
the
duke
kissed
the
limp
little
hand
and
recoiled
his
lips
touched
her
engagement
ring
as
he
went
out
he
met
the
countess
styvens
and
hardly
recognized
her
so
terribly
was
she
changed
she
stopped
him
do
not
leave
i
know
from
my
son
that
it
was
he
who
provoked
you
the
cause
of
your
duel
is
a
secret
that
i
shall
never
seek
to
know
may
god
pardon
my
son
and
free
you
from
all
remorse
i
go
to
my
daughter
all
i
have
left
to
love
and
protect
it
was
evident
that
the
noble
woman
was
making
a
great
effort
the
last
words
of
her
son
were
still
ringing
in
her
brain
de
morlay
knelt
and
watched
the
countess
disappear
into
the
room
chapter
xxix
the
doctor
declared
that
evening
that
esperance
had
congestion
of
the
brain
and
that
specialists
who
were
sent
for
from
paris
confirmed
the
diagnosis
the
dowager
would
not
hear
of
having
her
taken
away
the
tower
of
saint
genevieve
was
put
entirely
at
the
darbois
disposal
twos
sister
were
sent
for
and
jeanette
volunteered
to
do
the
heavy
work
all
the
other
servants
were
forbidden
to
approach
the
tower
the
countess
styvens
accompanied
by
the
duke
de
the
prince
and
princess
de
bernecourt
and
the
baron
van
berger
had
taken
the
body
of
her
son
to
be
buried
in
the
great
family
mausoleum
which
she
had
raised
to
the
memory
of
her
husband
at
her
country
place
of
lacken
maurice
and
genevieve
were
greatly
relieved
when
they
learned
that
the
countess
had
not
remained
in
her
crises
of
delirium
esperance
talked
and
talked
albert
no
no
i
do
not
love
him
i
love
the
duke
yes
he
saved
my
life
but
my
father
is
going
to
tell
him
i
can
not
keep
this
collar
it
is
cold
cold
it
strangles
me
i
am
stifling
i
am
going
to
die
yes
albert
you
shall
clasp
the
chain
every
morning
and
every
evening
no
my
head
is
not
too
low
i
can
see
the
beauty
of
perseus
better
he
is
coming
he
is
coming
to
cut
off
the
long
arms
that
hold
me
the
blood
there
the
blood
running
slowly
no
albert
do
not
die
i
will
love
you
the
duke
will
go
in
spite
of
her
trusting
confidence
the
poor
mother
must
have
come
to
wonder
and
perhaps
to
understand
when
esperance
regained
consciousness
the
worst
danger
was
over
only
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
had
heard
the
complete
revelation
jeanette
knew
too
but
genevieve
who
understood
that
she
was
there
to
keep
the
duke
informed
found
her
very
docile
and
repentant
and
did
not
send
her
away
the
countess
to
whom
they
had
sent
a
daily
bulletin
for
three
weeks
found
that
esperance
if
not
cured
was
at
least
on
the
way
to
convalescence
she
would
still
pass
many
hours
when
she
failed
to
recognize
people
a
kind
of
coma
took
possession
of
her
every
now
and
then
and
kept
her
for
days
together
in
a
kind
of
lethargy
the
season
was
getting
late
and
all
the
house
guests
had
left
the
dowager
duchess
did
not
wish
to
return
to
paris
although
her
son
who
had
become
a
deputy
as
she
wished
invited
her
to
come
and
stay
with
him
the
prince
de
bernecourt
had
had
to
once
more
take
up
his
post
but
his
wife
had
stayed
to
keep
her
friend
company
and
because
she
loved
the
little
darbois
as
she
called
her
the
duke
de
morlay
was
visiting
friends
whose
château
was
about
an
hour
journey
away
he
came
every
day
for
news
from
the
duchess
and
from
his
goddaughter
jeanette
a
month
went
by
the
young
girl
now
convalescent
was
strong
enough
to
be
moved
we
will
take
her
to
penhouet
for
a
month
said
françois
note
to
the
countess
and
when
she
is
quite
cured
we
will
send
her
to
you
in
brussels
the
duke
was
in
despair
at
the
idea
of
hearing
that
esperance
was
to

complained
to
maurice
whom
he
saw
every
day
can
i
not
see
esperance
yes
but
only
for
a
few
seconds
said
the
young
painter
i
believe
that
you
will
have
to
wait
several
months
before
you
can
renew
your
love
she
is
convalescent
but
not
cured
here
is
a
proposal
for
you
i
am
going
to
marry
mlle
hardouin
in
two
months
come
to
our
wedding
your
presence
will
seem
quite
natural
for
you
have
treated
me
as
a
friend
i
am
very
much
attached
to
you
and
i
am
sure
that
my
cousin
will
be
very
happy
with
you
when
you
are
married
but
will
she
be
well
in
two
months
the
doctor
assures
us
that
she
will
be
quite
herself
and
it
is
by
his
advice
that
we
have
set
that
date
for
our
marriage

you
think
mlle
hardouin
would
accept
me
as
a
witness
she
will
be
delighted
and
i
thank
you
genevieve
has
no
relations
except
her
elder
sister
who
brought
her
up
i
hope
that
this
marriage
will
recall
esperance
promise
to
her
meantime
i
shall
go
to
italy
for
about
the
two
months

if
i
may
say
to
her
i
will
go
now
he
was
soon
back
again
my
cousin
expects
you
it
was
more
than
a
month
since
the
duke
had
seen
esperance
he
was
painfully
shocked
by
the
change
in
her
pretty
face
she
looked
hardly
real
her
eyes
were
enormous
genevieve
and
mlle
frahender
were
with
her
here
is
the
duke
de
who
has
come
to
say
to
you
esperance
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
duke
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
you
she
said
simply
and
her
voice
sounded
like
the
tone
of
a
distant
harp
you
have
been
very
ill
i
have
been
very
ill
i
believe
but
i
can
not
remember
very
well
i
feel
as
if
i
had
had
heavy
blows
in
my
brain
sometimes
i
hear
dreadful
calls
and
then
everything
is
quiet
again
and
then
sometimes
i
see
a
piece
of
a
picture
no
beginning
no
end
sometimes
horrible
sometimes
lovely
why
now
i
remember
she
spoke
gently
with
a
charming
smile
that
you
are
part
of
all
my
visions
but
i
do
not
know
any
more
how
or
why
and
albert
where
is
he
why
does
he
not
come
he
must
come
and
undo
the
collar
ah
my
god
my
god
i
am
wandering
you
see
nothing
is
clear
yet
she
raised
her
arms
my
god
my
god
have
pity
on
me
or
take
me
at
once
i
do
not
want
to
lose
my
mind
she
took
the
duke
hand
say
you
are
not
sorry
that
you
loved
me
i
love
you
always
she
clapped
her
hands
with
a
silvery
laugh
genevieve
genevieve
he
loves
me
still
and
she
hid
her
head
on
the
young
girl
arm
maurice
led
the
duke
away
overcome
he
looked
questioningly
at
the
painter
no
she
will
not
be
long
the
doctors
all
agree
about
that
but
her
memory
will
have
to
come
back
by
degrees
a
little
at
a
time
she
recognized
you
she
remembered
her
love
and
yours
that
is
a
great
step
her
youth
her
love
and
time
will
be
i
believe
certain
restorers
the
duke
left
soon
after
they
had
taken
esperance
away
in
belgium
the
countess
had
prepared
for
her
beloved
daughter
this
beautiful
woman
of
forty
so
charming
so
handsome
in
her
mauve
mourning
had
already
become
an
old
woman
whose
movements
were
ever
slow
and
sad
her
back
was
bent
from
constantly
kneeling
beside
her
son
grave
her
black
clothes
reflected
the
deeper
gloom
of
her
expression
and
to
those
who
had
seen
her
a
few
months
before
she
was
almost
unrecognizable
poor
little
esperance
regained
her
health
very
slowly
her
mind
seemed
entirely
clear
only
on
one
subject
the
theatre
little
by
little
she
remembered
everything
connected
with
her
art
she
repeated
with
genevieve
and
jean
perliez
the
scenes
they
had
given
at
the
competition
she
worked
hard
on
musset
ne
badine
pas
avec
then
busied
herself
with
preparations
for
her
marriage
she
did
not
know
that
the
duke
was
to
be
a
witness
but
she
would
often
object
you
must
have
two
witnesses
and
you
have
only
one
i
have
two
said
genevieve
but
you
must
guess
the
name
of
the
second
chapter
xxx
the
wedding
solemnized
in
the
little
church
of
sauzen
at
was
very
private
maurice
had
for
witnesses
his
uncle
françois
darbois
and
the
marquis
de
montagnac
with
whom
he
had
become
great
friends
doctor
potain
and
the
duke
de
were
witnesses
for
genevieve
the
dowager
duchess
and
the
princess
de
bernecourt
were
present
the
countess
styvens
had
been
ill
for
a
month
and
could
not
leave
brussels
she
sent
a
magnificent
present
of
diamonds
and
pearls
to
genevieve
who
was
filled
with
joy
the
duchess
gave
the
young
bride
a
splendid
silver
service
and
the
princess
brought
with
her
some
beautiful
lace
genevieve
had
attached
herself
very
strongly
to
the
first
of
these
sweet
women
and
maurice
had
made
a
conquest
of
the
princess
by
painting
her
an
admirable
portrait
the
sight
of
the
duke
made
the
invalid
exuberant
with
joy
she
constantly
forgot
her
duties
as
maid
of
honour
to
draw
near
the
loved
being
doctor
potain
watched
her
closely
and
made
a
thorough
examination
he
knew
nothing
of
her
love
for
the
duke
but
when
the
latter
questioned
him
about
her
health
he
said
there
is
only
one
chance
of
restoring
her
health
she
must
go
back
on
the
stage
the
duke
jumped
impossible
he
said
why
impossible
her
fiancé
is
dead
the
duke
spoke
to
the
man
of
science
listen
to
me
doctor
i
am
passionately
in
love
with
this
girl
who
loved
me
but
only
remembers
that
at
intervals
i
can
not
indeed
approve
of
her
going
on
the
stage
urge
her
yourself
and
you
will
save
her
when
she
is
cured
if
she
loves
you
as
you
believe
she
will
leave
everything
to
follow
you
but
now
neurasthenia
or
madness
await
her
she
must
be
roused
to
work
outside
herself
do
as
i
tell
you
and
you
will
invite
me
to
your
wedding
the
duke
went
straight
to
find
françois
darbois
maurice
would
have
retired
no
said
the
duke
to
him
i
want
you
to
stay
and
he
told
them
word
for
word
what
the
doctor
had
said
well
what
do
you
think
françois
darbois
asked
him
i
think
that
the
most
important
thing
in
all
the
world
is
to
save
her
i
will
wait
françois
pressed
his
hand
and
there
was
taken
between
these
two
men
who
were
so
different
in
every
way
a
silent
pledge
that
both
were
determined
to
keep
at
all
costs
from
that
instant
each
one
strained
every
nerve
to
revive
in
esperance
her
dearest
desire
several
days
after
this
visit
esperance
received
a
letter
from
the
asking
her
to
come
to
the
office
she
turned
pink
her
lovely
forehead
brightened
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
she
handed
the
letter
to
her
father
who
knew
what
it
contained
and
had
been
watching
his
child
surprise
very
closely
we
must
go
back
to
paris
father
i
feel
entirely
well
good
mademoiselle
we
will
obey
your
orders
he
said
tenderly
she
kissed
her
father
as
she
used
to
do
and
began
to
tease
him
a
little
how
nice
it
is
to
have
such
an
agreeable
papa
you
have
plenty
of
cause
to
be
severe
for
i
give
you
endless
trouble
so
you
are
to
make
your
début
at
the
my
god
said
the
young
girl
starting
up
that
might
cost
you
your
election
françois
darbois
began
to
laugh
for
his
joy
returned
to
him
when
his
daughter
memory
came
back
to
her
leave
my
election
alone
they
wo
even
nominate
me
and
i
shall
not
worry
mme
darbois
came
in
and
françois
pretended
to
disclose
the
news
to
her
she
assumed
surprise
to
hide
her
emotion
she
took
her
daughter
in
a
long
embrace
maurice
had
taken
his
young
wife
to
italy
to
show
her
in
its
most
harmonious
setting
the
most
beautiful
aspirations
of
art
towards
the
ideal
the
duke
de
morlay
travelled
there
with
them
adoring
italy
as
does
every
devotee
of
art
there
was
not
a
corner
of
this
rare
country
that
he
did
not
know
the
sojourn
of
the
young
couple
in
italy
was
pure
enchantment
maurice
was
constantly
surprised
by
the
intellectual
strength
of
his
companion
like
most
artists
he
had
an
indulgent
scorn
for
what
so
many
call
and
think
the
worldly
class
when
he
originally
met
the
duke
he
had
recognized
his
cultivation
and
found
that
his
eclecticism
was
exact
profound
and
not
the
superficial
veneer
he
had
at
first
supposed
he
realized
that
men
of
the
world
do
not
vaunt
their
knowledge
though
it
is
often
far
deeper
than
that
of
certain
artists
who
never
go
below
the
depths
of
but
one
art
their
own
almost
every
day
maurice
received
a
letter
or
telegram
giving
him
news
of
his
cousin
the
advice
of
doctor
potain
seemed
to
be
justifying
itself
every
day
esperance
began
to
recover
her
health
and
spirits
she
was
rehearsing
at
the
comedie
and
her
début
in
ne
badine
pas
avec
was
announced
for
the
next
month
the
travellers
had
intended
to
spend
another
ten
days
in
italy
but
a
letter
to
genevieve
alarmed
them
she
read
it
aloud
my
darling
i
am
just
now
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
first
because
my
dear
cousin
is
seeing
so
many
beautiful
things
that
shine
through
her
letters
and
show
her
so
enchanted
with
life
that
i
feel
the
stimulus
myself
and
long
to
live
to
go
myself
to
breathe
the
divine
air
of
italy
and
admire
the
masterpieces
there
tell
the
duke
de
morlay
that
no
day
passes
without
my
thoughts
flying
to
him
only
one
thing
worries
me
i
can
confide
it
to
you
genevieve
you
who
are
so
perfectly
happy
why
does
the
theatre
draw
me
so
that
i
am
willing
to
sacrifice
for
it
even
those
i
love
i
see
the
countess
styvens
every
day
she
seems
a
light
ready
to
flicker
out
sometimes
she
looks
at
me
as
if
she
saw
me
far
very
far
away
and
murmurs
little
thing
it
is
not
her
fault
then
i
shiver
what
is
not
my
fault
albert
death
dear
albert
who
frightened
me
so
much
sometimes
that
i
felt
my
teeth
chattering
do
you
know
how
he
died
nobody
seems
to
know
genevieve
dear
the
pearl
collar
strangles
me
sometimes
i
promised
not
to
take
it
off
but
i
must
take
it
off
to
play
in
musset
play
must
i
she
can
not
wear
pearls
at
the
convent
when
i
promised
that
i
did
not
expect
ever
to
appear
on
the
stage
any
more
but
now
besides
when
i
am
on
the
stage
i
am
not
myself
at
all
esperance
stays
behind
in
the
and
comes
forth
then
the
collar
ask
the
duke
without
telling
him
that
i
asked
you
what
i
should
do
this
collar
seems
to
me
such
a
heavy
chain
so
heavy
and
sometimes
so
cold
i
must
stop
this
letter
for
you
see
the
confusion
is
coming
back
again
i
am
a
little
frightened
i
must
be
trembling
does
it
not
show
in
my
writing
it
is
little
mademoiselle
pen
i
embrace
you
with
all
the
strength
of
my
joy
in
your
esperance
the
writing
changed
i
must
make
esperance
stop
she
has
been
wandering
again
as
she
writes
her
pulse
is
very
quick
i
must
tell
her
father
revoir
dear
girl
and
come
back
soon
for
you
are
the
brightness
and
peace
she
longs
for
my
regards
to
your
eleanore
frahender
this
letter
made
maurice
his
wife
and
the
duke
very
anxious
she
must
in
some
way
be
prevented
from
seeing
the
countess
styvens
said
genevieve
but
how
are
we
to
manage
that
they
decided
to
shorten
their
stay
in
italy
by
five
days
esperance
was
to
appear
on
the
twentieth
of
december
about
fifteen
days
after
her
letter
reached
them
all
the
elegant
world
of
paris
artistic
was
waiting
with
delight
for
the
appearance
of
the
little
heroine
the
idol
of
the
public
count
styvens
death
in
a
duel
slain
by
a
admirer
of
esperance
had
caused
a
great
deal
of
ink
to
be
spilled
but
the
devotion
of
the
countess
towards
the
girl
who
would
have
been
her
daughter
the
denials
of
the
witnesses
to
the
most
intimate
friends
asking
if
really
between
ourselves
was
not
there
something
deceived
the
most
suspicious
all
these
fors
and
againsts
had
kindled
the
curiosity
of
the
public
and
the
general
sympathy
was
strongly
in
favour
of
the
unconscious
cause
of
the
great
modern
mystery
the
notice
announcing
the
first
appearance
of
esperance
darbois
in
ne
badine
pas
avec
drew
an
enormous
crowd
the
house
was
entirely
sold
out
several
days
in
advance
many
who
could
not
get
admission
waited
outside
the
theatre
to
get
news
during
the
intervals
the
corridors
were
full
of
french
and
foreign
reporters
behind
the
scenes
esperance
stood
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
it
was
almost
time
for
the
curtain
to
go
up
dressed
in
the
convent
robe
the
strings
of
pearls
was
still
about
her
neck
should
she
unclasp
it
should
she
not
if
they
went
with
her
on
the
stage
would
she
not
be
betraying
her
art
would
they
not
clutch
and
strangle
her
strangle
until
esperance
had
to
come
back
in
her
place
and
if
she
cast
it
aside
her
loyalty
her
promise
must
she
wear
fetters
to
keep
faith
oh
albert
albert
oh
these
dark
shadows
these
groping
dark
confusions
where
she
so
often
strayed
where
was
rest
or
peace
and
joy
the
joy
of
the
theatre
would
that
too
be
taken
away
she
swayed
a
little
and
longed
with
all
her
strength
for
a
force
not
her
own
to
enter
in
she
was
too
weak
to
fight
against
her
own
destiny
she
found
it
a
hint
of
it
came
first
in
the
scent
of
gardenia
flowers
sweet
and
strong
and
penetrating
compelling
and
agreeable
to
the
senses
then
the
duke
strong
arms
were
about
her
and
she
sank
gladly
back
as
if
she
were
falling
into
a
flood
of
light
but
his
swift
words
brought
her
back
esperance
my
darling
we
have
no
time
to
lose
come
with
me
the
countess
styvens
is
dying
she
would
not
send
for
you
she
would
not
spoil
your
triumph
but
she
can
absolve
you
she
can
loose
the
pearls
you
can
remember
the
other
request
albert
made
you
then
his
dying
wish
my
living
one
come
with
me
be
her
daughter
to
the
last
and
then
my
love
to
italy
where
we
will
find
you
health
and
strength
and
give
you
new
life
for
your
future
as
my
wife
the
end
