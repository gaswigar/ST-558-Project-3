a
passion
in
the
desert
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
ernest
dowson
a
passion
in
the
desert
the
whole
show
is
dreadful
she
cried
coming
out
of
the
menagerie
of
martin
she
had
just
been
looking
at
that
daring
speculator
working
with
his
hyena
to
speak
in
the
style
of
the
programme
by
what
means
she
continued
can
he
have
tamed
these
animals
to
such
a
point
as
to
be
certain
of
their
affection
for
what
seems
to
you
a
problem
said
i
interrupting
is
really
quite
oh
she
cried
letting
an
incredulous
smile
wander
over
her
lips
you
think
that
beasts
are
wholly
without
passions
i
asked
her
quite
the
reverse
we
can
communicate
to
them
all
the
vices
arising
in
our
own
state
of
she
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
astonishment
but
i
continued
the
first
time
i
saw
martin
i
admit
like
you
i
did
give
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
surprise
i
found
myself
next
to
an
old
soldier
with
the
right
leg
amputated
who
had
come
in
with
me
his
face
had
struck
me
he
had
one
of
those
heroic
heads
stamped
with
the
seal
of
warfare
and
on
which
the
battles
of
napoleon
are
written
besides
he
had
that
frank
expression
which
always
impresses
me
favorably
he
was
without
doubt
one
of
those
troopers
who
are
surprised
at
nothing
who
find
matter
for
laughter
in
the
contortions
of
a
dying
comrade
who
bury
or
plunder
him
quite
who
stand
intrepidly
in
the
way
of
bullets
in
fact
one
of
those
men
who
waste
no
time
in
deliberation
and
would
not
hesitate
to
make
friends
with
the
devil
himself
after
looking
very
attentively
at
the
proprietor
of
the
menagerie
getting
out
of
his
box
my
companion
pursed
up
his
lips
with
an
air
of
mockery
and
contempt
with
that
peculiar
and
expressive
twist
which
superior
people
assume
to
show
they
are
not
taken
in
then
when
i
was
expatiating
on
the
courage
of
martin
he
smiled
shook
his
head
knowingly
and
said
well
how
well
known
i
said
if
you
would
only
explain
me
the
mystery
i
should
be
vastly
after
a
few
minutes
during
which
we
made
acquaintance
we
went
to
dine
at
the
first
restauranteur
s
whose
shop
caught
our
eye
at
dessert
a
bottle
of
champagne
completely
refreshed
and
brightened
up
the
memories
of
this
odd
old
soldier
he
told
me
his
story
and
i
saw
that
he
was
right
when
he
exclaimed
well
when
she
got
home
she
teased
me
to
that
extent
was
so
charming
and
made
so
many
promises
that
i
consented
to
communicate
to
her
the
confidences
of
the
old
soldier
next
day
she
received
the
following
episode
of
an
epic
which
one
might
call
the
french
in
during
the
expedition
in
upper
egypt
under
general
desaix
a
provencal
soldier
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
maugrabins
and
was
taken
by
these
arabs
into
the
deserts
beyond
the
falls
of
the
nile
in
order
to
place
a
sufficient
distance
between
themselves
and
the
french
army
the
maugrabins
made
forced
marches
and
only
halted
when
night
was
upon
them
they
camped
round
a
well
overshadowed
by
palm
trees
under
which
they
had
previously
concealed
a
store
of
provisions
not
surmising
that
the
notion
of
flight
would
occur
to
their
prisoner
they
contented
themselves
with
binding
his
hands
and
after
eating
a
few
dates
and
giving
provender
to
their
horses
went
to
sleep
when
the
brave
provencal
saw
that
his
enemies
were
no
longer
watching
him
he
made
use
of
his
teeth
to
steal
a
scimiter
fixed
the
blade
between
his
knees
and
cut
the
cords
which
prevented
him
from
using
his
hands
in
a
moment
he
was
free
he
at
once
seized
a
rifle
and
a
dagger
then
taking
the
precautions
to
provide
himself
with
a
sack
of
dried
dates
oats
and
powder
and
shot
and
to
fasten
a
scimiter
to
his
waist
he
leaped
on
to
a
horse
and
spurred
on
vigorously
in
the
direction
where
he
thought
to
find
the
french
army
so
impatient
was
he
to
see
a
bivouac
again
that
he
pressed
on
the
already
tired
courser
at
such
speed
that
its
flanks
were
lacerated
with
his
spurs
and
at
last
the
poor
animal
died
leaving
the
frenchman
alone
in
the
desert
after
walking
some
time
in
the
sand
with
all
the
courage
of
an
escaped
convict
the
soldier
was
obliged
to
stop
as
the
day
had
already
ended
in
spite
of
the
beauty
of
an
oriental
sky
at
night
he
felt
he
had
not
strength
enough
to
go
on
fortunately
he
had
been
able
to
find
a
small
hill
on
the
summit
of
which
a
few
palm
trees
shot
up
into
the
air
it
was
their
verdure
seen
from
afar
which
had
brought
hope
and
consolation
to
his
heart
his
fatigue
was
so
great
that
he
lay
down
upon
a
rock
of
granite
capriciously
cut
out
like
a
there
he
fell
asleep
without
taking
any
precaution
to
defend
himself
while
he
slept
he
had
made
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
his
last
thought
was
one
of
regret
he
repented
having
left
the
maugrabins
whose
nomadic
life
seemed
to
smile
upon
him
now
that
he
was
far
from
them
and
without
help
he
was
awakened
by
the
sun
whose
pitiless
rays
fell
with
all
their
force
on
the
granite
and
produced
an
intolerable
heat
for
he
had
had
the
stupidity
to
place
himself
adversely
to
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
verdant
majestic
heads
of
the
palm
trees
he
looked
at
the
solitary
trees
and
shuddered
they
reminded
him
of
the
graceful
shafts
crowned
with
foliage
which
characterize
the
saracen
columns
in
the
cathedral
of
arles
but
when
after
counting
the
palm
trees
he
cast
his
eyes
around
him
the
most
horrible
despair
was
infused
into
his
soul
before
him
stretched
an
ocean
without
limit
the
dark
sand
of
the
desert
spread
further
than
eye
could
reach
in
every
direction
and
glittered
like
steel
struck
with
bright
light
it
might
have
been
a
sea
of
or
lakes
melted
together
in
a
mirror
a
fiery
vapor
carried
up
in
surging
waves
made
a
perpetual
whirlwind
over
the
quivering
land
the
sky
was
lit
with
an
oriental
splendor
of
insupportable
purity
leaving
naught
for
the
imagination
to
desire
heaven
and
earth
were
on
fire
the
silence
was
awful
in
its
wild
and
terrible
majesty
infinity
immensity
closed
in
upon
the
soul
from
every
side
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
not
a
breath
in
the
air
not
a
flaw
on
the
bosom
of
the
sand
ever
moving
in
diminutive
waves
the
horizon
ended
as
at
sea
on
a
clear
day
with
one
line
of
light
definite
as
the
cut
of
a
sword
the
provencal
threw
his
arms
round
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
palm
trees
as
though
it
were
the
body
of
a
friend
and
then
in
the
shelter
of
the
thin
straight
shadow
that
the
palm
cast
upon
the
granite
he
wept
then
sitting
down
he
remained
as
he
was
contemplating
with
profound
sadness
the
implacable
scene
which
was
all
he
had
to
look
upon
he
cried
aloud
to
measure
the
solitude
his
voice
lost
in
the
hollows
of
the
hill
sounded
faintly
and
aroused
no
echo
the
echo
was
in
his
own
heart
the
provencal
was
years
old
he
loaded
his
carbine
there
ll
be
time
enough
he
said
to
himself
laying
on
the
ground
the
weapon
which
alone
could
bring
him
deliverance
viewing
alternately
the
dark
expanse
of
the
desert
and
the
blue
expanse
of
the
sky
the
soldier
dreamed
of
france
he
smelled
with
delight
the
gutters
of
paris
he
remembered
the
towns
through
which
he
had
passed
the
faces
of
his
comrades
the
most
minute
details
of
his
life
his
southern
fancy
soon
showed
him
the
stones
of
his
beloved
provence
in
the
play
of
the
heat
which
undulated
above
the
wide
expanse
of
the
desert
realizing
the
danger
of
this
cruel
mirage
he
went
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
hill
to
that
by
which
he
had
come
up
the
day
before
the
remains
of
a
rug
showed
that
this
place
of
refuge
had
at
one
time
been
inhabited
at
a
short
distance
he
saw
some
palm
trees
full
of
dates
then
the
instinct
which
binds
us
to
life
awoke
again
in
his
heart
he
hoped
to
live
long
enough
to
await
the
passing
of
some
maugrabins
or
perhaps
he
might
hear
the
sound
of
cannon
for
at
this
time
bonaparte
was
traversing
egypt
this
thought
gave
him
new
life
the
palm
tree
seemed
to
bend
with
the
weight
of
the
ripe
fruit
he
shook
some
of
it
down
when
he
tasted
this
manna
he
felt
sure
that
the
palms
had
been
cultivated
by
a
former
inhabitant
the
savory
fresh
meat
of
the
dates
were
proof
of
the
care
of
his
predecessor
he
passed
suddenly
from
dark
despair
to
an
almost
insane
joy
he
went
up
again
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
cutting
down
one
of
the
sterile
palm
trees
which
the
night
before
had
served
him
for
shelter
a
vague
memory
made
him
think
of
the
animals
of
the
desert
and
in
case
they
might
come
to
drink
at
the
spring
visible
from
the
base
of
the
rocks
but
lost
further
down
he
resolved
to
guard
himself
from
their
visits
by
placing
a
barrier
at
the
entrance
of
his
hermitage
in
spite
of
his
diligence
and
the
strength
which
the
fear
of
being
devoured
asleep
gave
him
he
was
unable
to
cut
the
palm
in
pieces
though
he
succeeded
in
cutting
it
down
at
eventide
the
king
of
the
desert
fell
the
sound
of
its
fall
resounded
far
and
wide
like
a
sigh
in
the
solitude
the
soldier
shuddered
as
though
he
had
heard
some
voice
predicting
woe
but
like
an
heir
who
does
not
long
bewail
a
deceased
relative
he
tore
off
from
this
beautiful
tree
the
tall
broad
green
leaves
which
are
its
poetic
adornment
and
used
them
to
mend
the
mat
on
which
he
was
to
sleep
fatigued
by
the
heat
and
his
work
he
fell
asleep
under
the
red
curtains
of
his
wet
cave
in
the
middle
of
the
night
his
sleep
was
troubled
by
an
extraordinary
noise
he
sat
up
and
the
deep
silence
around
allowed
him
to
distinguish
the
alternative
accents
of
a
respiration
whose
savage
energy
could
not
belong
to
a
human
creature
a
profound
terror
increased
still
further
by
the
darkness
the
silence
and
his
waking
images
froze
his
heart
within
him
he
almost
felt
his
hair
stand
on
end
when
by
straining
his
eyes
to
their
utmost
he
perceived
through
the
shadow
two
faint
yellow
lights
at
first
he
attributed
these
lights
to
the
reflections
of
his
own
pupils
but
soon
the
vivid
brilliance
of
the
night
aided
him
gradually
to
distinguish
the
objects
around
him
in
the
cave
and
he
beheld
a
huge
animal
lying
but
two
steps
from
him
was
it
a
lion
a
tiger
or
a
crocodile
the
provencal
was
not
sufficiently
educated
to
know
under
what
species
his
enemy
ought
to
be
classed
but
his
fright
was
all
the
greater
as
his
ignorance
led
him
to
imagine
all
terrors
at
once
he
endured
a
cruel
torture
noting
every
variation
of
the
breathing
close
to
him
without
daring
to
make
the
slightest
movement
an
odor
pungent
like
that
of
a
fox
but
more
penetrating
more
profound
so
to
speak
filled
the
cave
and
when
the
provencal
became
sensible
of
this
his
terror
reached
its
height
for
he
could
no
longer
doubt
the
proximity
of
a
terrible
companion
whose
royal
dwelling
served
him
for
a
shelter
presently
the
reflection
of
the
moon
descending
on
the
horizon
lit
up
the
den
rendering
gradually
visible
and
resplendent
the
spotted
skin
of
a
panther
this
lion
of
egypt
slept
curled
up
like
a
big
dog
the
peaceful
possessor
of
a
sumptuous
niche
at
the
gate
of
an
hotel
its
eyes
opened
for
a
moment
and
closed
again
its
face
was
turned
towards
the
man
a
thousand
confused
thoughts
passed
through
the
frenchman
s
mind
first
he
thought
of
killing
it
with
a
bullet
from
his
gun
but
he
saw
there
was
not
enough
distance
between
them
for
him
to
take
proper
aim
the
shot
would
miss
the
mark
and
if
it
were
to
wake
the
thought
made
his
limbs
rigid
he
listened
to
his
own
heart
beating
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
and
cursed
the
too
violent
pulsations
which
the
flow
of
blood
brought
on
fearing
to
disturb
that
sleep
which
allowed
him
time
to
think
of
some
means
of
escape
twice
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
scimiter
intending
to
cut
off
the
head
of
his
enemy
but
the
difficulty
of
cutting
the
stiff
short
hair
compelled
him
to
abandon
this
daring
project
to
miss
would
be
to
die
for
certain
he
thought
he
preferred
the
chances
of
fair
fight
and
made
up
his
mind
to
wait
till
morning
the
morning
did
not
leave
him
long
to
wait
he
could
now
examine
the
panther
at
ease
its
muzzle
was
smeared
with
blood
she
s
had
a
good
dinner
he
thought
without
troubling
himself
as
to
whether
her
feast
might
have
been
on
human
flesh
she
won
t
be
hungry
when
she
gets
it
was
a
female
the
fur
on
her
belly
and
flanks
was
glistening
white
many
small
marks
like
velvet
formed
beautiful
bracelets
round
her
feet
her
sinuous
tail
was
also
white
ending
with
black
rings
the
overpart
of
her
dress
yellow
like
burnished
gold
very
lissome
and
soft
had
the
characteristic
blotches
in
the
form
of
rosettes
which
distinguish
the
panther
from
every
other
feline
species
this
tranquil
and
formidable
hostess
snored
in
an
attitude
as
graceful
as
that
of
a
cat
lying
on
a
cushion
her
paws
nervous
and
well
armed
were
stretched
out
before
her
face
which
rested
upon
them
and
from
which
radiated
her
straight
slender
whiskers
like
threads
of
silver
if
she
had
been
like
that
in
a
cage
the
provencal
would
doubtless
have
admired
the
grace
of
the
animal
and
the
vigorous
contrasts
of
vivid
color
which
gave
her
robe
an
imperial
splendor
but
just
then
his
sight
was
troubled
by
her
sinister
appearance
the
presence
of
the
panther
even
asleep
could
not
fail
to
produce
the
effect
which
the
magnetic
eyes
of
the
serpent
are
said
to
have
on
the
nightingale
for
a
moment
the
courage
of
the
soldier
began
to
fail
before
this
danger
though
no
doubt
it
would
have
risen
at
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
charged
with
shell
nevertheless
a
bold
thought
brought
daylight
to
his
soul
and
sealed
up
the
source
of
the
cold
sweat
which
sprang
forth
on
his
brow
like
men
driven
to
bay
who
defy
death
and
offer
their
body
to
the
smiter
so
he
seeing
in
this
merely
a
tragic
episode
resolved
to
play
his
part
with
honor
to
the
last
the
day
before
yesterday
the
arabs
would
have
killed
me
perhaps
he
said
so
considering
himself
as
good
as
dead
already
he
waited
bravely
with
excited
curiosity
the
awakening
of
his
enemy
when
the
sun
appeared
the
panther
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
then
she
put
out
her
paws
with
energy
as
if
to
stretch
them
and
get
rid
of
cramp
at
last
she
yawned
showing
the
formidable
apparatus
of
her
teeth
and
pointed
tongue
rough
as
a
file
a
regular
petite
maitresse
thought
the
frenchman
seeing
her
roll
herself
about
so
softly
and
coquettishly
she
licked
off
the
blood
which
stained
her
paws
and
muzzle
and
scratched
her
head
with
reiterated
gestures
full
of
prettiness
all
right
make
a
little
toilet
the
frenchman
said
to
himself
beginning
to
recover
his
gaiety
with
his
courage
we
ll
say
good
morning
to
each
other
presently
and
he
seized
the
small
short
dagger
which
he
had
taken
from
the
maugrabins
at
this
moment
the
panther
turned
her
head
toward
the
man
and
looked
at
him
fixedly
without
moving
the
rigidity
of
her
metallic
eyes
and
their
insupportable
luster
made
him
shudder
especially
when
the
animal
walked
towards
him
but
he
looked
at
her
caressingly
staring
into
her
eyes
in
order
to
magnetize
her
and
let
her
come
quite
close
to
him
then
with
a
movement
both
gentle
and
amorous
as
though
he
were
caressing
the
most
beautiful
of
women
he
passed
his
hand
over
her
whole
body
from
the
head
to
the
tail
scratching
the
flexible
vertebrae
which
divided
the
panther
s
yellow
back
the
animal
waved
her
tail
voluptuously
and
her
eyes
grew
gentle
and
when
for
the
third
time
the
frenchman
accomplished
this
interesting
flattery
she
gave
forth
one
of
those
purrings
by
which
cats
express
their
pleasure
but
this
murmur
issued
from
a
throat
so
powerful
and
so
deep
that
it
resounded
through
the
cave
like
the
last
vibrations
of
an
organ
in
a
church
the
man
understanding
the
importance
of
his
caresses
redoubled
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
surprise
and
stupefy
his
imperious
courtesan
when
he
felt
sure
of
having
extinguished
the
ferocity
of
his
capricious
companion
whose
hunger
had
so
fortunately
been
satisfied
the
day
before
he
got
up
to
go
out
of
the
cave
the
panther
let
him
go
out
but
when
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
she
sprang
with
the
lightness
of
a
sparrow
hopping
from
twig
to
twig
and
rubbed
herself
against
his
legs
putting
up
her
back
after
the
manner
of
all
the
race
of
cats
then
regarding
her
guest
with
eyes
whose
glare
had
softened
a
little
she
gave
vent
to
that
wild
cry
which
naturalists
compare
to
the
grating
of
a
saw
she
is
exacting
said
the
frenchman
smilingly
he
was
bold
enough
to
play
with
her
ears
he
caressed
her
belly
and
scratched
her
head
as
hard
as
he
could
when
he
saw
that
he
was
successful
he
tickled
her
skull
with
the
point
of
his
dagger
watching
for
the
right
moment
to
kill
her
but
the
hardness
of
her
bones
made
him
tremble
for
his
success
the
sultana
of
the
desert
showed
herself
gracious
to
her
slave
she
lifted
her
head
stretched
out
her
neck
and
manifested
her
delight
by
the
tranquility
of
her
attitude
it
suddenly
occurred
to
the
soldier
that
to
kill
this
savage
princess
with
one
blow
he
must
poniard
her
in
the
throat
he
raised
the
blade
when
the
panther
satisfied
no
doubt
laid
herself
gracefully
at
his
feet
and
cast
up
at
him
glances
in
which
in
spite
of
their
natural
fierceness
was
mingled
confusedly
a
kind
of
good
will
the
poor
provencal
ate
his
dates
leaning
against
one
of
the
palm
trees
and
casting
his
eyes
alternately
on
the
desert
in
quest
of
some
liberator
and
on
his
terrible
companion
to
watch
her
uncertain
clemency
the
panther
looked
at
the
place
where
the
date
stones
fell
and
every
time
that
he
threw
one
down
her
eyes
expressed
an
incredible
mistrust
she
examined
the
man
with
an
almost
commercial
prudence
however
this
examination
was
favorable
to
him
for
when
he
had
finished
his
meager
meal
she
licked
his
boots
with
her
powerful
rough
tongue
brushing
off
with
marvelous
skill
the
dust
gathered
in
the
creases
ah
but
when
she
s
really
hungry
thought
the
frenchman
in
spite
of
the
shudder
this
thought
caused
him
the
soldier
began
to
measure
curiously
the
proportions
of
the
panther
certainly
one
of
the
most
splendid
specimens
of
its
race
she
was
three
feet
high
and
four
feet
long
without
counting
her
tail
this
powerful
weapon
rounded
like
a
cudgel
was
nearly
three
feet
long
the
head
large
as
that
of
a
lioness
was
distinguished
by
a
rare
expression
of
refinement
the
cold
cruelty
of
a
tiger
was
dominant
it
was
true
but
there
was
also
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
face
of
a
sensual
woman
indeed
the
face
of
this
solitary
queen
had
something
of
the
gaiety
of
a
drunken
nero
she
had
satiated
herself
with
blood
and
she
wanted
to
play
the
soldier
tried
if
he
might
walk
up
and
down
and
the
panther
left
him
free
contenting
herself
with
following
him
with
her
eyes
less
like
a
faithful
dog
than
a
big
angora
cat
observing
everything
and
every
movement
of
her
master
when
he
looked
around
he
saw
by
the
spring
the
remains
of
his
horse
the
panther
had
dragged
the
carcass
all
that
way
about
two
thirds
of
it
had
been
devoured
already
the
sight
reassured
him
it
was
easy
to
explain
the
panther
s
absence
and
the
respect
she
had
had
for
him
while
he
slept
the
first
piece
of
good
luck
emboldened
him
to
tempt
the
future
and
he
conceived
the
wild
hope
of
continuing
on
good
terms
with
the
panther
during
the
entire
day
neglecting
no
means
of
taming
her
and
remaining
in
her
good
graces
he
returned
to
her
and
had
the
unspeakable
joy
of
seeing
her
wag
her
tail
with
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
at
his
approach
he
sat
down
then
without
fear
by
her
side
and
they
began
to
play
together
he
took
her
paws
and
muzzle
pulled
her
ears
rolled
her
over
on
her
back
stroked
her
warm
delicate
flanks
she
let
him
do
what
ever
he
liked
and
when
he
began
to
stroke
the
hair
on
her
feet
she
drew
her
claws
in
carefully
the
man
keeping
the
dagger
in
one
hand
thought
to
plunge
it
into
the
belly
of
the
too
confiding
panther
but
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
immediately
strangled
in
her
last
convulsive
struggle
besides
he
felt
in
his
heart
a
sort
of
remorse
which
bid
him
respect
a
creature
that
had
done
him
no
harm
he
seemed
to
have
found
a
friend
in
a
boundless
desert
half
unconsciously
he
thought
of
his
first
sweetheart
whom
he
had
nicknamed
mignonne
by
way
of
contrast
because
she
was
so
atrociously
jealous
that
all
the
time
of
their
love
he
was
in
fear
of
the
knife
with
which
she
had
always
threatened
him
this
memory
of
his
early
days
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
making
the
young
panther
answer
to
this
name
now
that
he
began
to
admire
with
less
terror
her
swiftness
suppleness
and
softness
toward
the
end
of
the
day
he
had
familiarized
himself
with
his
perilous
position
he
now
almost
liked
the
painfulness
of
it
at
last
his
companion
had
got
into
the
habit
of
looking
up
at
him
whenever
he
cried
in
a
falsetto
voice
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
mignonne
gave
several
times
running
a
profound
melancholy
cry
she
s
been
well
brought
up
said
the
lighthearted
soldier
she
says
her
but
this
mental
joke
only
occurred
to
him
when
he
noticed
what
a
pacific
attitude
his
companion
remained
in
come
ma
petite
blonde
i
ll
let
you
go
to
bed
first
he
said
to
her
counting
on
the
activity
of
his
own
legs
to
run
away
as
quickly
as
possible
directly
she
was
asleep
and
seek
another
shelter
for
the
night
the
soldier
waited
with
impatience
the
hour
of
his
flight
and
when
it
had
arrived
he
walked
vigorously
in
the
direction
of
the
nile
but
hardly
had
he
made
a
quarter
of
a
league
in
the
sand
when
he
heard
the
panther
bounding
after
him
crying
with
that
cry
more
dreadful
even
than
the
sound
of
her
leaping
ah
he
said
then
she
s
taken
a
fancy
to
me
she
has
never
met
anyone
before
and
it
is
really
quite
flattering
to
have
her
first
that
instant
the
man
fell
into
one
of
those
movable
quicksands
so
terrible
to
travelers
and
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
save
oneself
feeling
himself
caught
he
gave
a
shriek
of
alarm
the
panther
seized
him
with
her
teeth
by
the
collar
and
springing
vigorously
backwards
drew
him
as
if
by
magic
out
of
the
whirling
sand
ah
mignonne
cried
the
soldier
caressing
her
enthusiastically
we
re
bound
together
for
life
and
death
but
no
jokes
mind
and
he
retraced
his
steps
from
that
time
the
desert
seemed
inhabited
it
contained
a
being
to
whom
the
man
could
talk
and
whose
ferocity
was
rendered
gentle
by
him
though
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
the
reason
for
their
strange
friendship
great
as
was
the
soldier
s
desire
to
stay
upon
guard
he
slept
on
awakening
he
could
not
find
mignonne
he
mounted
the
hill
and
in
the
distance
saw
her
springing
toward
him
after
the
habit
of
these
animals
who
can
not
run
on
account
of
the
extreme
flexibility
of
the
vertebral
column
mignonne
arrived
her
jaws
covered
with
blood
she
received
the
wonted
caress
of
her
companion
showing
with
much
purring
how
happy
it
made
her
her
eyes
full
of
languor
turned
still
more
gently
than
the
day
before
toward
the
provencal
who
talked
to
her
as
one
would
to
a
tame
animal
ah
mademoiselle
you
are
a
nice
girl
aren
t
you
just
look
at
that
so
we
like
to
be
made
much
of
don
t
we
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
so
you
have
been
eating
some
arab
or
other
have
you
that
doesn
t
matter
they
re
animals
just
the
same
as
you
are
but
don
t
you
take
to
eating
frenchmen
or
i
shan
t
like
you
any
she
played
like
a
dog
with
its
master
letting
herself
be
rolled
over
knocked
about
and
stroked
alternately
sometimes
she
herself
would
provoke
the
soldier
putting
up
her
paw
with
a
soliciting
gesture
some
days
passed
in
this
manner
this
companionship
permitted
the
provencal
to
appreciate
the
sublime
beauty
of
the
desert
now
that
he
had
a
living
thing
to
think
about
alternations
of
fear
and
quiet
and
plenty
to
eat
his
mind
became
filled
with
contrast
and
his
life
began
to
be
diversified
solitude
revealed
to
him
all
her
secrets
and
enveloped
him
in
her
delights
he
discovered
in
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
sights
unknown
to
the
world
he
knew
what
it
was
to
tremble
when
he
heard
over
his
head
the
hiss
of
a
bird
s
wing
so
rarely
did
they
pass
or
when
he
saw
the
clouds
changing
and
many
colored
travelers
melt
one
into
another
he
studied
in
the
night
time
the
effect
of
the
moon
upon
the
ocean
of
sand
where
the
simoom
made
waves
swift
of
movement
and
rapid
in
their
change
he
lived
the
life
of
the
eastern
day
marveling
at
its
wonderful
pomp
then
after
having
reveled
in
the
sight
of
a
hurricane
over
the
plain
where
the
whirling
sands
made
red
dry
mists
and
clouds
he
would
welcome
the
night
with
joy
for
then
fell
the
healthful
freshness
of
the
stars
and
he
listened
to
imaginary
music
in
the
skies
then
solitude
taught
him
to
unroll
the
treasures
of
dreams
he
passed
whole
hours
in
remembering
mere
nothings
and
comparing
his
present
life
with
his
past
at
last
he
grew
passionately
fond
of
the
panther
for
some
sort
of
affection
was
a
necessity
whether
it
was
that
his
will
powerfully
projected
had
modified
the
character
of
his
companion
or
whether
because
she
found
abundant
food
in
her
predatory
excursions
in
the
desert
she
respected
the
man
s
life
he
began
to
fear
for
it
no
longer
seeing
her
so
well
tamed
he
devoted
the
greater
part
of
his
time
to
sleep
but
he
was
obliged
to
watch
like
a
spider
in
its
web
that
the
moment
of
his
deliverance
might
not
escape
him
if
anyone
should
pass
the
line
marked
by
the
horizon
he
had
sacrificed
his
shirt
to
make
a
flag
with
which
he
hung
at
the
top
of
a
palm
tree
whose
foliage
he
had
torn
off
taught
by
necessity
he
found
the
means
of
keeping
it
spread
out
by
fastening
it
with
little
sticks
for
the
wind
might
not
be
blowing
at
the
moment
when
the
passing
traveler
was
looking
through
the
desert
it
was
during
the
long
hours
when
he
had
abandoned
hope
that
he
amused
himself
with
the
panther
he
had
come
to
learn
the
different
inflections
of
her
voice
the
expressions
of
her
eyes
he
had
studied
the
capricious
patterns
of
all
the
rosettes
which
marked
the
gold
of
her
robe
mignonne
was
not
even
angry
when
he
took
hold
of
the
tuft
at
the
end
of
her
tail
to
count
her
rings
those
graceful
ornaments
which
glittered
in
the
sun
like
jewelry
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
contemplate
the
supple
fine
outlines
of
her
form
the
whiteness
of
her
belly
the
graceful
pose
of
her
head
but
it
was
especially
when
she
was
playing
that
he
felt
most
pleasure
in
looking
at
her
the
agility
and
youthful
lightness
of
her
movements
were
a
continual
surprise
to
him
he
wondered
at
the
supple
way
in
which
she
jumped
and
climbed
washed
herself
and
arranged
her
fur
crouched
down
and
prepared
to
spring
however
rapid
her
spring
might
be
however
slippery
the
stone
she
was
on
she
would
always
stop
short
at
the
word
one
day
in
a
bright
midday
sun
an
enormous
bird
coursed
through
the
air
the
man
left
his
panther
to
look
at
his
new
guest
but
after
waiting
a
moment
the
deserted
sultana
growled
deeply
my
goodness
i
do
believe
she
s
jealous
he
cried
seeing
her
eyes
become
hard
again
the
soul
of
virginie
has
passed
into
her
body
that
s
the
eagle
disappeared
into
the
air
while
the
soldier
admired
the
curved
contour
of
the
panther
but
there
was
such
youth
and
grace
in
her
form
she
was
beautiful
as
a
woman
the
blond
fur
of
her
robe
mingled
well
with
the
delicate
tints
of
faint
white
which
marked
her
flanks
the
profuse
light
cast
down
by
the
sun
made
this
living
gold
these
russet
markings
to
burn
in
a
way
to
give
them
an
indefinable
attraction
the
man
and
the
panther
looked
at
one
another
with
a
look
full
of
meaning
the
coquette
quivered
when
she
felt
her
friend
stroke
her
head
her
eyes
flashed
like
lightning
then
she
shut
them
tightly
she
has
a
soul
he
said
looking
at
the
stillness
of
this
queen
of
the
sands
golden
like
them
white
like
them
solitary
and
burning
like
them
well
she
said
i
have
read
your
plea
in
favor
of
beasts
but
how
did
two
so
well
adapted
to
understand
each
other
end
ah
well
you
see
they
ended
as
all
great
passions
do
end
by
a
misunderstanding
for
some
reason
one
suspects
the
other
of
treason
they
don
t
come
to
an
explanation
through
pride
and
quarrel
and
part
from
sheer
yet
sometimes
at
the
best
moments
a
single
word
or
a
look
is
enough
but
anyhow
go
on
with
your
it
s
horribly
difficult
but
you
will
understand
after
what
the
old
villain
told
me
over
his
champagne
he
said
i
don
t
know
if
i
hurt
her
but
she
turned
round
as
if
enraged
and
with
her
sharp
teeth
caught
hold
of
my
leg
gently
i
daresay
but
i
thinking
she
would
devour
me
plunged
my
dagger
into
her
throat
she
rolled
over
giving
a
cry
that
froze
my
heart
and
i
saw
her
dying
still
looking
at
me
without
anger
i
would
have
given
all
the
world
my
cross
even
which
i
had
not
got
then
to
have
brought
her
to
life
again
it
was
as
though
i
had
murdered
a
real
person
and
the
soldiers
who
had
seen
my
flag
and
were
come
to
my
assistance
found
me
in
well
sir
he
said
after
a
moment
of
silence
since
then
i
have
been
in
war
in
germany
in
spain
in
russia
in
france
i
ve
certainly
carried
my
carcase
about
a
good
deal
but
never
have
i
seen
anything
like
the
desert
ah
yes
it
is
very
beautiful
what
did
you
feel
there
i
asked
him
oh
that
can
t
be
described
young
man
besides
i
am
not
always
regretting
my
palm
trees
and
my
panther
i
should
have
to
be
very
melancholy
for
that
in
the
desert
you
see
there
is
everything
and
yes
but
explain
well
he
said
with
an
impatient
gesture
it
is
god
without
mankind
