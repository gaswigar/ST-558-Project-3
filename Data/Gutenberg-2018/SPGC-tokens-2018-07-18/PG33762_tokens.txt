the
adventures
of
elizabeth
in
rügen
the
first
day
from
miltzow
to
lauterbach
every
one
who
has
been
to
school
and
still
remembers
what
he
was
taught
there
knows
that
rügen
is
the
biggest
island
germany
possesses
and
that
it
lies
in
the
baltic
sea
off
the
coast
of
pomerania
round
this
island
i
wished
to
walk
this
summer
but
no
one
would
walk
with
me
it
is
the
perfect
way
of
moving
if
you
want
to
see
into
the
life
of
things
it
is
the
one
way
of
freedom
if
you
go
to
a
place
on
anything
but
your
own
feet
you
are
taken
there
too
fast
and
miss
a
thousand
delicate
joys
that
were
waiting
for
you
by
the
wayside
if
you
drive
you
are
bound
by
a
variety
of
considerations
eight
of
the
most
important
being
the
horses
legs
if
you
bicycle
but
who
that
loves
to
get
close
to
nature
would
bicycle
and
as
for
motors
the
object
of
a
journey
like
mine
was
not
the
getting
to
a
place
but
the
going
there
successively
did
i
invite
the
most
likely
of
my
women
friends
numbering
at
least
a
dozen
to
walk
with
me
they
one
and
all
replied
that
it
would
make
them
tired
and
that
it
would
be
dull
and
when
i
tried
to
remove
the
first
objection
by
telling
them
how
excellent
it
would
be
for
the
german
nation
especially
those
portions
of
it
that
are
still
to
come
if
its
women
walked
round
rügen
more
often
they
stared
and
smiled
and
when
i
tried
to
remove
the
second
by
explaining
that
by
our
own
spirits
are
we
deified
they
stared
and
smiled
more
than
ever
walking
then
was
out
of
the
question
for
i
could
not
walk
alone
the
grim
monster
conventionality
whose
iron
claws
are
for
ever
on
my
shoulder
for
ever
pulling
me
back
from
the
harmless
and
the
wholesome
put
a
stop
to
that
even
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
of
tramps
which
i
was
so
i
drove
and
it
was
round
rügen
that
i
drove
because
one
hot
afternoon
when
i
was
idling
in
the
library
not
reading
but
fingering
the
books
taking
out
first
one
and
then
another
dipping
into
them
deciding
which
i
would
read
next
i
came
across
marianne
of
a
happy
and
hit
upon
the
page
where
she
begins
to
talk
of
rügen
immediately
interested
for
is
not
rügen
nearer
to
me
than
any
other
island
i
became
absorbed
in
her
description
of
the
bathing
near
a
place
called
putbus
of
the
deliciousness
of
it
in
a
sandy
cove
where
the
water
was
always
calm
and
of
how
you
floated
about
on
its
crystal
surface
and
beautiful
stars
of
purest
colours
floated
with
you
i
threw
down
the
book
to
ransack
the
shelves
for
a
guide
to
rügen
on
the
first
page
of
the
first
one
i
found
was
this
remarkable
paragraph
thou
the
name
rügen
so
doth
a
wondrous
spell
come
over
thee
before
thine
eyes
it
rises
as
a
dream
of
beauteous
fairylands
images
and
figures
of
long
ago
beckon
thee
across
to
the
marvellous
places
where
in
grey
prehistoric
times
they
dwelt
and
on
which
they
have
left
the
shadow
of
their
presence
and
in
thee
stirs
a
mighty
desire
to
wander
over
the
glorious
island
cord
up
then
thy
light
bundle
take
to
heart
shylock
advice
to
put
money
in
thy
purse
and
follow
me
without
fear
of
the
threatening
which
may
overtake
thee
on
the
short
crossing
for
it
has
never
yet
done
any
one
more
harm
than
imposing
on
him
a
discomfort
this
seemed
to
me
very
irresistible
surely
a
place
that
inspired
such
a
mingling
of
the
lofty
and
the
homely
in
its
must
be
well
worth
seeing
there
was
a
drought
just
then
going
on
at
home
my
eyes
were
hot
with
watching
a
garden
parch
browner
day
by
day
beneath
a
sky
of
brass
i
felt
that
it
only
needed
a
little
energy
and
in
a
few
hours
i
too
might
be
floating
among
those
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
of
the
island
and
even
better
than
being
surrounded
by
legends
those
breathless
days
would
it
be
to
have
the
sea
all
round
me
such
a
sea
too
did
i
not
know
it
did
i
not
know
its
singular
limpidity
the
divineness
of
its
blue
where
it
was
deep
the
clearness
of
its
green
where
it
was
shallow
lying
tideless
along
its
amber
shores
the
very
words
made
me
thirsty
amber
shores
lazy
waves
lapping
them
slowly
vast
spaces
for
the
eye
to
wander
over
rocks
and
seaweed
and
cool
gorgeous
the
very
map
at
the
beginning
of
the
made
me
thirsty
the
land
was
so
succulently
green
the
sea
all
round
so
bland
a
blue
and
what
a
fascinating
island
it
is
on
the
map
an
island
of
twists
and
curves
and
inland
seas
called
bodden
of
lakes
and
woods
and
frequent
ferries
with
lesser
islands
dotted
about
its
coasts
with
bays
innumerable
stretching
their
arms
out
into
the
water
and
with
one
huge
forest
evidently
magnificent
running
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
east
coast
following
its
curves
dipping
down
to
the
sea
in
places
and
in
others
climbing
up
chalk
cliffs
to
crown
them
with
the
peculiar
splendour
of
beeches
it
does
not
take
me
long
to
make
up
my
mind
still
less
to
cord
up
my
light
bundle
for
somebody
else
does
that
and
i
think
it
was
only
two
days
after
i
first
found
marianne
north
and
the
that
my
maid
gertrud
and
i
got
out
of
a
suffocating
train
into
the
freshness
that
blows
round
ryefields
near
the
sea
and
began
our
journey
into
the
unknown
it
was
a
little
wayside
station
on
the
line
between
berlin
and
stralsund
called
miltzow
a
solitary
red
building
on
the
edge
of
a
that
witnessed
the
beginning
of
our
tour
the
carriage
had
been
sent
on
the
day
before
and
round
it
on
our
arrival
stood
the
station
authorities
in
an
interested
group
the
stationmaster
everywhere
in
germany
an
elaborate
olympic
person
in
white
gloves
actually
helped
the
porter
to
cord
on
my
with
his
own
hands
and
they
both
lingered
over
it
as
if
loth
to
let
us
go
evidently
the
coachman
had
told
them
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
i
suppose
such
an
enterprising
woman
does
not
get
out
at
miltzow
every
day
they
packed
us
in
with
the
greatest
care
with
so
much
care
that
i
thought
they
would
never
have
done
my
was
the
biggest
piece
of
luggage
and
they
corded
it
on
in
an
upright
position
at
our
feet
i
had
left
the
choosing
of
its
contents
to
gertrud
only
exhorting
her
besides
my
pillow
to
take
a
sufficiency
of
soap
and
gertrud
luggage
was
placed
by
the
porter
on
her
lap
it
was
almost
too
modest
it
was
one
small
black
bag
and
a
great
part
of
its
inside
must
i
knew
be
taken
up
by
the
stockings
she
had
brought
to
knit
and
the
needles
she
did
it
with
yet
she
looked
quite
as
respectable
the
day
we
came
home
as
she
did
the
day
we
started
and
every
bit
as
clean
my
was
put
on
the
box
and
on
top
of
it
was
a
brown
cardboard
containing
the
coachman
hat
a
thick
coat
for
possible
cold
days
made
a
cushion
for
my
back
and
gertrud
waterproof
did
the
same
thing
for
hers
wedged
in
between
us
was
the
rattling
inharmoniously
but
preventing
our
slipping
together
in
sloping
places
behind
us
in
the
hood
were
the
umbrellas
rugs
and
maps
besides
one
of
those
round
shiny
yellow
wooden
into
which
every
decent
german
woman
puts
her
best
hat
this
luggage
and
some
mysterious
bundles
on
the
box
that
the
coachman
thought
were
hidden
by
his
legs
but
which
bulged
out
unhideable
on
either
side
prevented
our
looking
elegant
but
i
did
not
want
to
look
elegant
and
i
had
gathered
from
the
remarks
of
those
who
had
refused
to
walk
that
rügen
was
not
a
place
where
i
should
meet
any
one
who
did
now
i
suppose
i
could
talk
for
a
week
and
yet
give
no
idea
whatever
of
the
exultation
that
filled
my
soul
as
i
gazed
on
these
arrangements
the
simplicity
of
them
was
so
full
of
promise
it
was
as
though
i
were
going
back
to
the
very
morning
of
life
to
those
fresh
years
when
shepherd
boys
and
others
shout
round
one
for
no
reason
except
that
they
are
out
of
doors
and
alive
also
during
the
years
that
have
come
after
years
that
may
properly
be
called
riper
it
has
been
a
conviction
of
mine
that
there
is
nothing
so
absolutely
bracing
for
the
soul
as
the
frequent
turning
of
one
back
on
duties
this
was
exactly
what
i
was
doing
and
oh
ye
rigid
female
martyrs
on
the
rack
of
daily
exemplariness
ye
unquestioning
patient
followers
of
paths
that
have
been
pointed
out
if
only
you
knew
the
wholesome
joys
of
sometimes
being
less
good
the
point
at
which
we
were
is
the
nearest
from
which
rügen
can
be
reached
by
persons
coming
up
from
the
south
and
going
to
drive
no
one
ever
gets
out
there
who
is
bound
for
rügen
because
no
one
ever
drives
to
rügen
the
ordinary
tourist
almost
exclusively
german
goes
first
to
stralsund
is
taken
across
the
narrow
strip
of
water
train
and
all
on
the
steam
ferry
and
continues
without
changing
till
he
reaches
the
open
sea
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
at
sassnitz
or
he
goes
by
train
from
berlin
to
stettin
and
then
by
steamer
down
the
oder
crosses
the
open
sea
for
four
hours
and
arrives
probably
pensive
for
the
boats
are
small
and
the
waves
are
often
big
at
göhren
the
first
on
the
island
east
coast
we
were
not
ordinary
tourists
and
having
got
to
miltzow
were
to
be
independent
of
all
such
wearinesses
as
trains
and
steamers
till
the
day
we
wanted
to
come
back
again
from
miltzow
we
were
going
to
drive
to
a
ferry
three
miles
off
at
a
place
called
stahlbrode
cross
the
mile
of
water
land
on
the
island
south
shore
and
go
on
at
once
that
afternoon
to
the
of
miss
north
putbus
which
were
beckoning
me
across
to
the
island
far
more
irresistibly
than
any
of
those
grey
figures
the
talked
about
the
carriage
was
a
light
one
of
the
victoria
genus
with
a
hood
the
horses
were
a
pair
esteemed
at
home
for
their
meekness
the
coachman
august
was
a
youth
who
had
never
yet
driven
straight
on
for
an
indefinite
period
without
turning
round
once
and
he
looked
as
though
he
thought
he
were
going
to
enjoy
himself
i
was
sure
i
was
going
to
enjoy
myself
gertrud
i
fancy
was
without
these
illusions
but
she
is
old
and
has
got
out
of
the
habit
of
being
anything
but
resigned
she
was
the
sop
on
this
occasion
thrown
to
the
grim
one
of
the
iron
claws
for
i
would
far
rather
have
gone
alone
but
gertrud
is
very
silent
to
go
with
her
would
be
as
nearly
like
being
alone
as
it
is
possible
to
be
when
you
are
not
she
could
i
knew
be
trusted
to
sit
by
my
side
knitting
however
bumpy
the
road
and
not
opening
her
lips
unless
asked
a
question
admirable
virtue
of
silence
most
precious
because
most
rare
jewel
in
the
crown
of
female
excellences
not
possessed
by
a
single
one
of
those
who
had
refused
to
walk
if
either
of
them
had
occupied
gertrud
place
and
driven
with
me
would
she
not
after
the
way
of
women
have
spent
the
first
half
of
the
time
telling
me
her
secrets
and
the
other
half
being
angry
with
me
because
i
knew
them
and
then
gertrud
after
having
kept
quiet
all
day
would
burst
into
activities
at
night
unpack
the
produce
pleasant
things
like
slippers
see
that
my
bed
was
as
i
like
it
and
end
by
tucking
me
up
in
it
and
going
away
on
tiptoe
with
her
customary
quaint
benediction
bestowed
on
me
every
night
at
bedtime
dear
god
protect
and
bless
the
gracious
one
says
gertrud
as
she
blows
out
the
candle
may
he
also
protect
and
bless
thee
i
reply
and
could
as
ill
spare
my
pillow
as
her
blessing
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
of
the
middle
friday
in
july
when
we
left
the
station
officials
to
go
back
to
their
dull
work
and
trotted
round
the
corner
into
the
wide
world
the
sky
was
a
hot
blue
the
road
wound
with
gentle
ups
and
downs
between
fields
whitening
to
harvest
high
over
our
heads
the
larks
quivered
in
the
light
shaking
out
that
rapturous
song
that
i
can
never
hear
without
a
throb
of
gratitude
for
being
alive
there
were
no
woods
or
hills
and
we
could
see
a
long
way
on
either
side
see
the
red
roofs
of
farms
clustered
wherever
there
was
a
hollow
to
protect
them
from
the
wild
winds
of
winter
see
the
straight
double
line
of
trees
where
the
high
road
to
stralsund
cut
across
ours
see
a
little
village
a
mile
ahead
of
us
with
a
venerable
church
on
a
mound
in
the
middle
of
it
gravely
presiding
over
the
surrounding
wide
parish
of
corn
i
think
i
must
have
got
out
at
least
six
times
during
the
short
drive
between
miltzow
and
the
ferry
pretending
i
wanted
flowers
but
really
to
enjoy
the
delight
of
loitering
the
rye
was
full
of
chickory
and
poppies
the
ditches
along
the
road
where
the
spring
dampness
still
lingered
were
white
with
the
delicate
loveliness
of
that
most
spiritual
of
weeds
i
picked
an
armful
of
it
to
hold
up
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
while
we
were
driving
i
gave
gertrud
a
bunch
of
poppies
for
which
she
thanked
me
without
enthusiasm
i
put
little
posies
of
chickory
at
the
horses
ears
in
fact
i
felt
and
behaved
as
if
i
were
fifteen
and
out
for
my
first
summer
holiday
but
what
did
it
matter
there
was
nobody
there
to
see
stahlbrode
is
the
most
place
a
small
cluster
of
cottages
on
grass
that
goes
down
to
the
water
it
was
quite
empty
and
silent
it
has
a
long
narrow
wooden
jetty
running
across
the
marshy
shore
to
the
ferry
and
moored
to
the
end
of
this
jetty
lay
a
big
with
furled
brown
sails
i
got
out
and
walked
down
to
it
to
see
if
it
were
the
and
whether
the
ferryman
was
in
it
both
august
and
the
horses
had
an
alarmed
expression
as
they
saw
me
going
out
into
the
jaws
of
the
sea
even
the
emotionless
gertrud
put
away
her
stocking
and
stood
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
watching
me
the
jetty
was
roughly
put
together
and
so
narrow
that
the
carriage
would
only
just
fit
in
a
slight
wooden
rail
was
all
the
protection
provided
but
the
water
was
not
deep
and
heaved
limpidly
over
the
yellow
sand
at
the
bottom
the
shore
we
were
on
was
flat
and
vividly
green
the
shore
of
rügen
opposite
was
flat
and
vividly
green
the
sea
between
was
a
lovely
sparkling
blue
the
sky
was
strewn
across
with
loose
clusters
of
pearly
clouds
the
breeze
that
had
played
so
gently
among
the
ears
of
corn
round
miltzow
danced
along
the
little
waves
and
splashed
them
gaily
against
the
wooden
posts
of
the
jetty
as
though
the
freshness
down
there
on
the
water
had
filled
it
with
new
life
i
found
the
boat
empty
a
thing
of
steep
sides
and
curved
bottom
a
thing
that
was
surely
never
intended
for
the
ferrying
across
of
horses
and
carriages
no
other
boat
was
to
be
seen
up
the
channel
and
down
the
channel
there
was
nothing
visible
but
the
flat
green
shores
the
dancing
water
the
wide
sky
the
bland
afternoon
light
i
turned
back
thoughtfully
to
the
cottages
suppose
the
ferry
were
only
used
for
ferrying
people
if
so
we
were
in
an
extremely
tiresome
fix
a
long
way
back
against
the
sky
i
could
see
the
line
of
trees
bordering
the
road
to
stralsund
and
the
whole
dull
dusty
distance
would
have
to
be
driven
over
if
the
stahlbrode
ferry
failed
us
august
took
off
his
hat
when
i
came
up
to
him
and
said
ominously
the
gracious
one
permit
that
i
speak
a
few
words
them
august
is
very
windy
very
is
far
to
go
on
water
very
yet
have
i
been
on
the
sea
you
are
going
on
it
now
with
an
expression
made
up
of
two
parts
fright
and
one
resignation
he
put
on
his
hat
again
and
relapsed
into
a
silence
that
was
grim
i
took
gertrud
with
me
to
give
me
a
countenance
and
walked
across
to
the
inn
a
new
house
standing
out
boldly
on
a
bit
of
rising
ground
end
ways
on
to
the
sea
the
door
was
open
and
we
went
in
knocking
with
my
sunshade
on
the
floor
we
stirred
up
no
life
of
any
sort
not
even
a
dog
barked
at
us
the
passage
was
wide
and
clean
with
doors
on
each
side
of
it
and
an
open
door
at
either
end
the
one
we
had
come
in
by
followed
by
the
afternoon
sun
and
the
other
framing
a
picture
of
sky
with
the
sea
at
the
bottom
the
jetty
the
smack
with
folded
sails
and
the
coast
of
rügen
seeing
a
door
with
painted
on
it
i
opened
it
and
peeped
in
to
my
astonishment
it
was
full
of
men
smoking
in
silence
and
all
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
opening
door
they
must
have
heard
us
they
must
have
seen
us
passing
the
window
as
we
came
up
to
the
house
i
concluded
that
the
custom
of
the
district
requires
that
strangers
shall
in
no
way
be
interfered
with
until
they
actually
ask
definite
questions
that
it
was
so
became
clear
by
the
alacrity
with
which
a
man
jumped
up
on
our
asking
how
we
could
get
across
to
rügen
and
told
us
he
was
the
ferryman
and
would
take
us
there
there
is
a
carriage
can
that
go
too
i
inquired
anxiously
thinking
of
the
deep
bottom
and
steep
sides
of
the
he
said
cheerily
and
calling
to
a
boy
to
come
and
help
he
led
the
way
through
the
door
framing
the
sea
down
a
tiny
sandy
garden
prickly
with
gooseberry
bushes
to
the
place
where
august
sat
marvelling
on
his
box
along
he
shouted
as
he
ran
past
him
along
that
thing
of
wood
cried
august
my
horses
and
my
carriage
along
shouted
the
ferryman
down
the
jetty
on
august
i
commanded
can
never
be
accomplished
said
august
visibly
breaking
out
into
a
perspiration
on
i
repeated
sternly
but
thought
it
on
the
whole
more
discreet
to
go
on
myself
on
my
own
feet
and
so
did
gertrud
the
gracious
one
insists
faltered
august
and
began
to
drive
gingerly
down
to
the
jetty
with
the
face
of
one
who
thinks
his
last
hour
well
on
the
way
as
i
had
feared
the
carriage
was
very
nearly
smashed
getting
it
over
the
sides
of
the
smack
i
sat
up
in
the
bows
looking
on
in
terror
expecting
every
instant
to
see
the
wheels
wrenched
off
and
with
their
wrenching
the
end
of
our
holiday
the
optimistic
ferryman
assured
us
that
it
was
going
in
quite
easily
like
a
lamb
he
declared
with
great
boldness
of
imagery
he
sloped
two
ineffectual
planks
one
for
each
set
of
wheels
up
the
side
of
the
boat
and
he
and
august
hatless
coatless
and
breathless
lifted
the
carriage
over
on
to
them
it
was
a
horrid
moment
the
front
wheels
twisted
right
round
and
were
as
near
coming
off
as
any
wheels
i
saw
in
my
life
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
august
so
right
did
he
seem
to
have
been
when
he
protested
that
the
thing
could
not
be
accomplished
yet
there
was
rügen
and
here
were
we
and
we
had
to
get
across
to
it
somehow
or
turn
round
and
do
the
dreary
journey
to
stralsund
the
horses
both
exceedingly
restive
had
been
unharnessed
and
got
in
first
they
were
held
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
by
two
boys
who
needed
all
their
determination
to
do
it
then
it
was
that
i
was
thankful
for
the
boat
steep
sides
for
if
they
had
been
lower
those
horses
would
certainly
have
kicked
themselves
over
into
the
sea
and
what
should
i
have
done
then
and
how
should
i
have
faced
him
who
is
in
authority
over
me
if
i
returned
to
him
without
his
horses
take
them
across
daily
the
ferryman
remarked
airily
jerking
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
carriage
so
many
people
drive
to
rügen
i
asked
astonished
for
the
plank
arrangements
were
staringly
makeshift
people
cried
the
ferryman
speaking
crowds
he
was
trying
to
make
me
happy
at
least
it
reassured
august
to
hear
it
but
i
could
not
suppress
a
smile
of
deprecation
at
the
size
of
the
fib
by
this
time
we
were
under
weigh
a
fair
wind
sending
us
merrily
over
the
water
the
ferryman
steered
august
stood
at
his
horses
heads
talking
to
them
soothingly
the
two
boys
came
and
sat
on
some
coiled
ropes
close
to
me
leaned
their
elbows
on
their
knees
and
their
chins
on
their
hands
and
fixing
their
blue
eyes
on
my
face
kept
them
there
with
an
unwinking
interest
during
the
entire
crossing
oh
it
was
lovely
sitting
up
there
in
the
sun
safe
so
far
in
the
delicious
quiet
of
sailing
the
tawny
sail
darned
and
patched
in
divers
shades
of
brown
and
red
and
orange
towered
above
us
against
the
sky
the
huge
mast
seemed
to
brush
along
across
the
very
surface
of
the
little
white
clouds
above
the
rippling
of
the
water
we
could
hear
the
distant
larks
on
either
shore
august
had
put
on
his
scarlet
for
the
work
of
lifting
the
carriage
in
and
made
a
beautiful
bit
of
colour
among
the
browns
of
the
old
boat
at
the
stern
the
eyes
of
the
ferryman
lost
all
the
alertness
they
had
had
on
shore
and
he
stood
at
the
rudder
gazing
dreamily
out
at
the
afternoon
light
on
the
rügen
meadows
how
perfect
it
was
after
the
train
after
the
clattering
along
the
dusty
road
and
the
heat
and
terror
of
getting
on
board
for
one
exquisite
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
softly
lapped
across
in
the
sun
and
for
all
that
beauty
we
were
only
asked
to
pay
three
marks
which
included
the
horses
and
carriage
and
the
labour
of
getting
us
in
and
out
for
a
further
small
sum
the
ferryman
became
enthusiastic
and
begged
me
to
be
sure
to
come
back
that
way
there
was
a
single
house
on
the
rügen
shore
where
he
lived
he
said
and
from
which
he
would
watch
for
us
a
little
dog
came
down
to
welcome
us
but
we
saw
no
other
living
creature
the
carriage
conducted
itself
far
more
like
a
lamb
on
this
side
and
i
drove
away
well
pleased
to
have
got
over
the
chief
difficulty
of
the
tour
the
ferryman
wishing
us
godspeed
and
the
two
boys
unwinking
to
the
last
so
here
we
were
on
the
island
thou
isle
of
fairyland
filled
with
beckoning
figures
i
murmured
under
my
breath
careful
not
to
appear
too
unaccountable
in
gertrud
eyes
with
eager
interest
i
looked
about
me
and
anything
less
like
fairyland
and
more
like
the
coast
of
pomerania
lately
left
i
have
seldom
seen
the
road
a
continuation
of
the
road
on
the
mainland
was
exactly
like
other
roads
that
are
dull
as
far
as
a
rambling
village
three
miles
farther
on
called
garz
persons
referring
to
the
map
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
will
see
with
what
a
melancholy
straightness
it
proceeds
to
that
village
and
after
garz
i
ceased
to
care
what
it
was
like
for
reasons
which
i
will
now
set
forth
there
was
that
afternoon
in
the
of
garz
and
i
know
not
why
since
it
was
neither
a
sunday
nor
a
holiday
a
brass
band
playing
with
a
singular
sonorousness
the
horses
having
never
before
been
required
to
listen
to
music
their
functions
at
home
being
solely
to
draw
me
through
the
solitudes
of
forests
did
not
like
it
i
was
astonished
at
the
vigour
of
the
dislike
they
showed
who
were
wont
to
be
so
meek
they
danced
through
garz
pursued
by
the
braying
of
the
trumpets
and
the
delighted
shouts
of
the
crowd
who
seemed
to
bray
and
shout
the
louder
the
more
the
horses
danced
and
i
was
considering
whether
the
time
had
not
come
for
clinging
to
gertrud
and
shutting
my
eyes
when
we
turned
a
corner
and
got
away
from
the
noise
on
to
the
familiar
rattle
of
the
hard
country
road
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
stretched
out
my
head
to
see
whether
it
were
as
straight
a
bit
as
the
last
it
was
quite
as
straight
and
in
the
distance
bearing
down
on
us
was
a
black
speck
that
swelled
at
an
awful
speed
into
a
motor
car
now
the
horses
had
not
yet
seen
a
motor
car
their
nerves
already
shaken
by
the
brass
band
would
never
stand
such
a
horrid
sight
i
thought
and
prudence
urged
an
immediate
getting
out
and
a
rushing
to
their
heads
august
i
cried
out
gertrud
there
a
dreadful
thing
coming
they
sure
to
bolt
august
slowed
down
in
apparent
obedience
to
my
order
and
without
waiting
for
him
to
stop
entirely
the
motor
being
almost
upon
us
i
jumped
out
on
one
side
and
gertrud
jumped
out
on
the
other
before
i
had
time
to
run
to
the
horses
heads
the
motor
whizzed
past
the
horses
strange
to
say
hardly
cared
at
all
only
mildly
shying
as
august
drove
them
slowly
along
without
stopping
all
right
i
remarked
greatly
relieved
to
gertrud
who
still
held
her
stocking
we
get
in
again
but
we
could
not
get
in
again
because
august
did
not
stop
to
him
to
stop
i
said
to
gertrud
turning
aside
to
pick
some
unusually
big
poppies
she
called
but
he
did
not
stop
louder
gertrud
i
said
impatiently
for
we
were
now
a
good
way
behind
she
called
louder
but
he
did
not
stop
then
i
called
then
she
called
then
we
called
together
but
he
did
not
stop
on
the
contrary
he
was
driving
on
now
at
the
usual
pace
rattling
noisily
over
the
hard
road
getting
more
and
more
out
of
reach
shout
gertrud
i
cried
in
a
frenzy
but
how
could
any
one
so
respectable
as
gertrud
shout
she
sent
a
faint
shriek
after
the
august
and
when
i
tried
to
shout
myself
i
was
seized
with
such
uncontrollable
laughter
that
nothing
whatever
of
the
nature
of
a
noise
could
be
produced
meanwhile
august
was
growing
very
small
in
the
distance
he
evidently
did
not
know
we
had
got
out
when
the
motor
car
appeared
and
was
under
the
pleasing
impression
that
we
were
sitting
behind
him
being
jogged
comfortably
towards
putbus
he
dwindled
and
dwindled
with
a
rapidity
distressing
to
witness
shout
i
gasped
myself
contorted
with
dreadful
laughter
mirth
and
half
despair
she
began
to
trot
down
the
road
after
him
waving
her
stocking
at
his
distant
back
and
emitting
a
series
of
shrill
shrieks
goaded
by
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
the
last
we
saw
of
the
carriage
was
a
yellow
glint
as
the
sun
caught
the
shiny
surface
of
my
bandbox
immediately
afterwards
it
vanished
over
the
edge
of
a
dip
in
the
road
and
we
were
alone
with
nature
gertrud
and
i
stared
at
each
other
in
speechless
dismay
then
she
looked
on
in
silence
while
i
sank
on
to
a
milestone
and
laughed
there
was
nothing
her
look
said
to
laugh
at
and
much
to
be
earnest
over
in
our
tragic
predicament
and
i
knew
it
but
i
could
not
stop
august
had
had
no
instructions
as
to
where
he
was
driving
to
or
where
we
were
going
to
put
up
that
night
of
putbus
and
marianna
north
he
had
never
heard
with
the
open
ordnance
map
on
my
lap
i
had
merely
called
out
directions
since
leaving
miltzow
at
therefore
in
all
human
probability
he
would
drive
straight
on
till
dark
no
doubt
in
growing
private
astonishment
at
the
absence
of
orders
and
the
length
of
the
way
then
when
night
came
he
would
i
supposed
want
to
light
his
lamps
and
getting
down
to
do
so
would
immediately
be
frozen
with
horror
at
what
he
saw
or
rather
did
not
see
in
the
carriage
what
he
would
do
after
that
i
could
not
conceive
in
sheerest
despair
i
laughed
till
i
cried
and
the
sight
of
gertrud
watching
me
silently
from
the
middle
of
the
deserted
road
only
made
me
less
able
to
leave
off
behind
us
in
the
distance
at
the
end
of
a
vista
of
trees
were
the
houses
of
garz
in
front
of
us
a
long
way
in
front
of
us
rose
the
red
spire
of
the
church
of
casnewitz
a
village
through
which
as
i
still
remembered
from
the
map
now
driving
along
by
itself
our
road
to
putbus
lay
up
and
down
the
whiteness
of
this
road
not
a
living
creature
either
in
a
cart
or
on
its
legs
was
to
be
seen
the
bald
country
here
very
bald
and
desolate
stretched
away
on
either
side
into
nothingness
the
wind
sighed
about
whisking
little
puffs
of
derisive
dust
into
our
eyes
as
it
passed
there
was
a
dreadful
absence
of
anything
like
sounds
doubt
said
gertrud
will
soon
return
wo
i
said
wiping
my
eyes
go
on
for
ever
he
wound
up
nothing
will
stop
him
then
will
the
gracious
one
do
after
him
i
suppose
i
said
getting
up
trust
to
something
unexpected
making
him
find
out
he
has
got
us
but
i
afraid
nothing
will
come
on
gertrud
i
continued
feigning
briskness
while
my
heart
was
as
lead
nearly
six
already
and
the
road
is
long
and
lonely
groaned
gertrud
who
never
walks
a
cart
will
pass
us
and
give
us
a
lift
if
not
we
walk
to
that
village
with
the
church
over
there
and
see
if
we
can
get
something
on
wheels
to
pursue
august
with
come
on
i
hope
your
boots
are
all
right
groaned
gertrud
again
lifting
up
one
foot
as
a
dog
pitifully
lifts
up
its
wounded
paw
and
showing
me
a
black
cashmere
boot
of
the
sort
that
is
soft
and
pleasant
to
the
feet
of
servants
who
are
not
required
to
use
them
much
afraid
they
not
much
good
on
this
hard
road
i
said
us
hope
something
will
catch
us
up
soon
groaned
poor
gertrud
whose
feet
are
very
tender
but
nothing
did
catch
us
up
and
we
trudged
along
in
grim
silence
the
desire
to
laugh
all
gone
must
my
dear
gertrud
i
said
after
a
while
seeking
to
be
cheerful
this
in
the
light
of
healthful
exercise
you
and
i
are
taking
a
pleasant
afternoon
walk
together
in
rügen
gertrud
said
nothing
at
all
times
loathing
movement
out
of
doors
she
felt
that
this
walking
was
peculiarly
hateful
because
it
had
no
visible
end
and
what
would
become
of
us
if
we
were
forced
to
spend
the
night
in
some
inn
without
our
luggage
the
only
thing
i
had
with
me
was
my
purse
the
presence
of
which
containing
as
it
did
all
the
money
i
had
brought
caused
me
to
cast
a
careful
eye
at
short
intervals
behind
me
less
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
cart
than
in
the
fear
of
seeing
a
tramp
and
the
only
thing
gertrud
had
was
her
stocking
also
we
had
had
nothing
to
eat
but
a
scrappy
lunch
hours
before
in
the
train
and
my
intention
had
been
to
have
food
at
putbus
and
then
drive
down
to
a
place
called
lauterbach
which
being
on
the
seashore
was
more
convenient
for
the
than
putbus
and
spend
the
night
there
in
an
hotel
much
recommended
by
the
by
this
time
according
to
my
plans
we
ought
to
have
been
sitting
in
putbus
eating
i
asked
rather
faintly
my
soul
drooping
within
me
at
the
thought
of
the
you
hungry
gertrud
sighed
is
long
since
we
ate
she
said
we
trudged
on
in
silence
for
another
five
minutes
i
asked
again
for
during
those
five
minutes
my
thoughts
had
dwelt
with
a
shameful
persistency
on
the
succulent
and
the
gross
you
hungry
gracious
one
too
must
be
in
need
of
food
evaded
gertrud
who
for
some
reason
never
would
admit
she
wanted
feeding
she
is
i
sighed
and
again
we
trudged
on
in
silence
it
seemed
a
long
while
before
we
reached
that
edge
over
which
my
bandbox
had
disappeared
flashing
farewell
as
it
went
and
when
we
did
get
to
it
and
eagerly
looked
along
the
fresh
stretch
of
road
in
hopes
of
seeing
august
miraculously
turned
back
we
gave
a
simultaneous
groan
for
it
was
as
deserted
as
the
one
we
had
just
come
along
something
lay
in
the
middle
of
it
a
few
yards
on
a
dark
object
like
a
little
heap
of
brown
leaves
thinking
it
was
leaves
i
saw
no
reason
for
comment
but
gertrud
whose
eyes
are
very
sharp
exclaimed
do
you
see
august
i
cried
no
but
there
in
the
road
the
it
was
indeed
the
shaken
out
as
it
naturally
would
be
on
the
removal
of
the
bodies
that
had
kept
it
in
its
place
come
to
us
like
the
ravens
of
old
to
give
us
strength
and
sustenance
still
contains
food
said
gertrud
hurrying
towards
it
heaven
said
i
we
dragged
it
out
of
the
road
to
the
grass
at
the
side
and
gertrud
lit
the
and
warmed
what
was
left
in
the
teapot
of
the
tea
it
was
of
an
awful
blackness
no
water
was
to
be
got
near
and
we
dared
not
leave
the
road
to
look
for
any
in
case
august
should
come
back
there
were
some
sorry
pieces
of
cake
one
or
two
chicken
sandwiches
grown
unaccountably
horrible
and
all
those
strawberries
we
had
avoided
at
lunch
because
they
were
too
small
or
two
much
squashed
over
these
mournful
revels
the
church
spire
of
casnewitz
now
come
much
closer
presided
it
was
the
silent
witness
of
how
honourably
we
shared
and
how
gertrud
got
the
odd
sandwich
because
of
her
cashmere
boots
then
we
buried
the
in
a
ditch
in
a
bed
of
long
grass
and
for
it
was
plain
that
i
could
not
ask
gertrud
who
could
hardly
walk
as
it
was
to
carry
it
and
it
was
equally
plain
that
i
could
not
carry
it
myself
for
it
was
as
mysteriously
heavy
as
other
and
in
size
very
nearly
as
big
as
i
am
so
we
buried
it
not
without
some
natural
regrets
and
a
dim
feeling
that
we
were
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
and
there
it
is
i
suppose
grown
very
rusty
to
this
day
after
that
gertrud
got
along
a
little
better
and
my
thoughts
being
no
longer
concentrated
on
food
i
could
think
out
what
was
best
to
be
done
the
result
was
that
on
reaching
casnewitz
we
inquired
at
once
which
of
the
cottages
was
an
inn
and
having
found
one
asked
a
man
who
seemed
to
belong
there
to
let
us
have
a
conveyance
with
as
much
speed
as
possible
have
you
come
from
he
inquired
staring
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
from
garz
garz
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
putbus
putbus
are
you
staying
there
yes
anyhow
we
wish
to
drive
there
kindly
let
us
start
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
no
cart
said
gertrud
with
much
dignity
did
you
not
say
so
at
once
ja
why
did
i
not
we
walked
out
is
very
unpleasant
gertrud
i
remarked
and
i
wondered
what
those
at
home
would
say
if
they
knew
that
on
the
very
first
day
of
my
i
had
managed
to
lose
the
carriage
and
had
had
to
bear
the
banter
of
publicans
is
a
little
shop
said
gertrud
the
gracious
one
permit
that
i
make
inquiries
there
we
went
in
and
gertrud
did
the
talking
is
not
very
far
from
here
said
the
old
man
presiding
who
was
at
least
polite
do
not
the
ladies
walk
my
horse
has
been
out
all
day
and
my
son
who
drives
him
has
other
things
now
to
do
we
ca
walk
i
broke
in
must
drive
because
we
might
want
to
go
beyond
putbus
we
are
not
sure
it
depends
the
old
man
looked
puzzled
is
it
that
the
ladies
wish
to
go
he
inquired
trying
to
be
patient
putbus
anyhow
perhaps
only
to
putbus
we
ca
tell
till
we
get
there
but
indeed
indeed
you
must
let
us
have
your
horse
still
puzzled
the
old
man
went
out
to
consult
with
his
son
and
we
waited
in
profound
dejection
among
candles
and
coffee
putbus
was
not
as
he
had
said
far
but
i
remembered
how
on
the
map
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
nest
of
all
radiating
from
a
round
circus
sort
of
place
in
the
middle
which
of
them
would
august
consider
to
be
the
straight
continuation
of
the
road
from
garz
once
beyond
putbus
he
would
be
lost
to
us
indeed
it
took
about
half
an
hour
to
persuade
the
son
and
to
harness
the
horse
and
while
this
was
going
on
we
stood
at
the
door
watching
the
road
and
listening
eagerly
for
sounds
of
wheels
one
cart
did
pass
going
in
the
direction
of
garz
and
when
i
heard
it
coming
i
was
so
sure
that
it
was
august
that
i
triumphantly
called
to
gertrud
to
run
and
tell
the
old
man
we
did
not
need
his
son
gertrud
wiser
waited
till
she
saw
what
it
was
and
after
the
quenching
of
that
sudden
hope
we
both
drooped
more
than
ever
am
i
to
drive
to
asked
the
son
whipping
up
his
horse
and
bumping
us
away
over
the
stones
of
casnewitz
he
sat
huddled
up
looking
exceedingly
sulky
manifestly
disgusted
at
having
to
go
out
again
at
the
end
of
a
day
work
as
for
the
cart
it
was
a
sad
contrast
to
the
cushioned
comfort
of
the
vanished
victoria
it
was
very
high
very
wooden
very
shaky
and
we
sat
on
a
plank
in
the
middle
of
so
terrible
a
noise
that
when
we
wanted
to
say
anything
we
had
to
shout
am
i
to
drive
to
repeated
the
youth
scowling
over
his
shoulder
drive
straight
on
until
you
meet
a
carriage
what
carriage
carriage
carriage
he
scowled
round
again
with
deepened
disgust
you
have
a
carriage
he
said
looking
at
us
as
though
he
were
afraid
we
were
lunatics
are
you
in
my
cart
why
why
are
we
i
cried
wringing
my
hands
overcome
by
the
wretchedness
of
our
plight
for
we
were
now
beyond
casnewitz
and
gazing
anxiously
ahead
with
the
strained
eyes
of
sister
annes
we
saw
the
road
as
straight
and
as
empty
as
ever
the
youth
drove
on
in
sullen
silence
his
very
ears
seeming
to
flap
with
scorn
no
more
good
words
would
he
waste
on
two
mad
women
the
road
now
lay
through
woods
beautiful
beechwoods
that
belong
to
prince
putbus
not
fenced
off
but
invitingly
open
to
every
one
with
green
shimmering
depths
and
occasional
flashes
of
deer
the
tops
of
the
great
beeches
shone
like
gold
against
the
sky
the
sea
must
have
been
quite
close
for
though
it
was
not
visible
the
smell
of
it
was
everywhere
the
nearer
we
got
to
putbus
the
more
civilised
did
the
road
become
seats
appeared
on
either
side
at
intervals
that
grew
more
frequent
instead
of
the
usual
wooden
iron
ones
with
tarnished
gilt
lettering
pointed
down
the
forest
lanes
and
soon
we
met
the
first
of
the
putbus
also
iron
and
elaborate
wandered
out
as
it
seemed
beyond
the
natural
sphere
of
to
light
the
innocent
country
road
all
these
signs
portended
what
germans
call
in
english
obviously
or
more
elegantly
visitors
to
a
bathing
resort
and
presently
when
we
were
nearer
putbus
we
began
to
pass
them
strolling
in
groups
and
couples
and
sitting
on
the
seats
which
were
of
stone
and
could
not
have
been
good
things
for
warm
to
sit
on
wretched
as
i
was
i
still
saw
the
quaintness
and
prettiness
of
putbus
there
was
a
notice
up
that
all
vehicles
must
drive
through
it
at
a
walking
pace
so
we
crawled
along
its
principal
street
which
whatever
else
it
contained
contained
no
sign
of
august
this
street
has
prince
putbus
grounds
on
one
side
and
a
line
of
irregular
houses
all
white
all
and
all
charming
on
the
other
a
double
row
of
great
trees
forms
a
shady
walk
on
the
edge
of
the
grounds
and
it
is
bountifully
supplied
with
those
stone
seats
so
fatal
i
am
sure
to
many
an
honest
the
grounds
trim
and
shady
have
neat
paths
winding
into
their
recesses
from
the
road
with
no
fence
or
wall
or
obstacle
of
any
sort
to
be
surmounted
by
the
timid
tourist
every
tourist
may
walk
in
them
as
long
and
as
often
as
he
likes
without
the
least
preliminary
bother
of
gates
and
lodges
as
we
jolted
slowly
over
the
rough
stones
we
were
objects
of
the
liveliest
interest
to
the
sitting
out
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
inns
having
supper
no
sign
whatever
of
august
was
to
be
seen
not
even
an
ordnance
map
as
i
had
half
expected
lying
in
the
road
our
cart
made
more
noise
here
than
ever
it
being
characteristic
of
putbus
that
things
on
wheels
are
heard
for
an
amazing
time
before
and
after
their
passing
it
is
the
drowsiest
little
town
grass
grows
undisturbed
between
the
cobbles
of
the
street
along
the
gutters
and
in
the
cracks
of
the
pavement
on
the
sidewalk
one
or
two
shops
seem
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
all
the
inhabitants
including
the
boys
at
the
school
here
which
is
a
sort
of
german
eton
and
from
what
i
saw
in
the
windows
their
needs
are
chiefly
and
cakes
there
is
a
white
theatre
with
a
colonnade
as
quaint
as
all
the
rest
the
houses
have
many
windows
and
balconies
hung
about
with
flowers
the
place
did
not
somehow
seem
real
in
the
bright
flood
of
evening
sunlight
it
looked
like
a
place
in
a
picture
or
a
dream
but
the
pausing
in
their
eating
to
stare
at
us
were
enjoying
themselves
in
a
very
solid
and
undreamlike
fashion
not
in
the
least
in
harmony
with
the
quaint
background
in
spite
of
my
forlorn
condition
i
could
not
help
reflecting
on
its
probable
charms
in
winter
under
the
clear
green
of
the
cold
sky
with
all
these
people
away
when
the
frosted
branches
of
the
trees
stretch
across
to
deserted
windows
when
the
theatre
is
silent
for
months
when
the
inns
only
keep
as
much
of
themselves
open
as
meets
the
requirements
of
the
infrequent
commercial
traveller
and
the
cutting
wind
blows
down
the
street
empty
all
day
long
certainly
a
perfect
place
to
spend
a
quiet
winter
in
to
go
to
when
one
is
tired
of
noise
and
bustle
and
of
a
world
choked
to
the
point
of
suffocation
with
strenuous
persons
trying
to
do
each
other
good
rooms
in
one
of
those
spacious
old
houses
with
the
large
windows
facing
the
sun
and
plenty
of
books
if
i
were
that
abstracted
but
happy
form
of
reptile
called
a
bookworm
which
i
believed
i
am
prevented
from
being
only
by
my
sex
the
genus
i
am
told
being
persistently
male
i
would
take
care
to
spend
at
least
one
of
my
life
winters
in
putbus
how
divinely
quiet
it
would
be
what
a
place
for
him
who
intends
to
pass
an
examination
to
write
a
book
or
who
wants
the
crumples
got
by
crushing
together
too
long
with
his
fellows
to
be
smoothed
out
of
his
soul
and
what
walks
there
would
be
to
stretch
legs
and
spirits
grown
stiff
in
the
crisp
wintry
woods
where
the
pale
sunshine
falls
across
unspoilt
snow
sitting
in
my
cart
of
sorrow
in
summer
sultriness
i
could
feel
the
ineffable
pure
cold
of
winter
strike
my
face
at
the
mere
thought
the
ineffable
pure
cold
that
spurs
the
most
languid
mind
into
activity
thus
far
had
i
got
in
my
reflections
and
we
had
jolted
slowly
down
about
half
the
length
of
the
street
when
a
tremendous
clatter
of
hoofs
and
wheels
coming
towards
us
apparently
at
a
gallop
in
starkest
defiance
of
regulations
brought
me
back
with
a
jerk
to
the
miserable
present
remarked
the
surly
youth
hastily
drawing
on
one
side
the
at
supper
flung
down
their
knives
and
forks
and
started
up
to
look
hah
cried
some
of
them
ist
verboten
schritt
schritt
can
he
halt
cried
others
horses
have
bolted
why
does
he
beat
them
cried
the
first
is
august
shrieked
gertrud
august
we
are
here
stop
stop
for
with
staring
eyes
and
set
mouth
august
was
actually
galloping
past
us
this
time
he
did
hear
gertrud
shriek
acute
with
anguish
and
pulled
the
horses
on
to
their
haunches
never
have
i
seen
unhappy
coachman
with
so
white
a
face
he
had
had
it
appeared
the
most
stringent
private
instructions
before
leaving
home
to
take
care
of
me
and
on
the
very
first
day
to
let
me
somehow
tumble
out
and
lose
me
he
was
tearing
back
in
the
awful
conviction
that
he
would
find
gertrud
and
myself
in
the
form
of
corpses
god
he
cried
devoutly
on
seeing
us
god
is
the
gracious
one
unhurt
certainly
poor
august
had
had
the
worst
of
it
now
it
is
most
unlikely
that
the
of
putbus
will
ever
enjoy
themselves
quite
so
much
again
their
suppers
all
grew
cold
while
they
crowded
round
to
see
and
listen
august
in
his
relief
was
a
changed
creature
he
was
voluble
and
loud
as
i
never
could
have
believed
jumping
off
his
box
to
turn
the
horses
round
and
help
me
out
of
the
cart
he
explained
to
me
and
to
all
and
any
who
chose
to
listen
how
he
had
driven
on
and
on
through
putbus
straight
round
the
circus
to
the
continuation
of
the
road
on
the
north
side
where
revealed
to
him
that
he
was
heading
for
bergen
more
and
more
surprised
at
receiving
no
orders
more
and
more
struck
by
the
extreme
silence
behind
him
gracious
one
he
amplified
for
the
benefit
of
the
tourists
occasional
observations
with
fräulein
the
tourists
gazed
at
gertrud
the
cessation
of
these
became
by
degrees
noticeable
yet
it
is
not
permissible
that
a
coachman
should
turn
to
look
or
interfere
with
a
that
chooses
to
be
silent
us
get
on
august
i
interrupted
much
embarrassed
by
all
this
luggage
must
be
seen
to
the
strain
of
the
rapid
driving
a
dozen
helpful
hands
stretched
out
with
offers
of
string
continued
august
not
to
be
stopped
in
his
excited
account
manipulating
the
string
and
my
with
shaking
fingers
finally
by
the
mercy
of
providence
the
map
used
by
the
gracious
one
fell
out
i
knew
it
would
a
peasant
was
passing
he
called
to
me
he
pointed
to
the
road
i
pulled
up
i
turned
round
and
what
did
i
see
what
i
then
saw
i
shall
never
no
never
forget
no
not
if
my
life
should
continue
to
a
hundred
he
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
gasped
the
crowd
waited
breathless
turned
round
continued
august
i
saw
nothing
you
said
you
would
never
forget
what
you
saw
objected
a
man
never
shall
i
forget
it
you
saw
nothing
at
all
nothing
never
will
i
forget
it
you
saw
nothing
you
can
not
forget
it
persisted
the
dissatisfied
man
say
i
can
not
it
is
what
i
say
will
do
august
i
said
wish
to
drive
on
the
surly
youth
had
been
listening
with
his
chin
on
his
hand
he
now
removed
his
chin
stretched
his
hand
across
to
me
sitting
safely
among
my
cushions
and
said
me
him
gertrud
i
said
and
having
been
paid
he
turned
his
horse
and
drove
back
to
casnewitz
scornful
to
the
last
on
august
i
ordered
on
we
can
hold
this
thing
on
with
our
feet
get
on
to
your
box
and
go
on
the
energy
in
my
voice
penetrated
at
last
through
his
agitation
he
got
up
on
to
his
box
settled
himself
in
a
flustered
sort
of
fashion
the
tourists
fell
apart
staring
their
last
and
hardest
at
a
vision
about
to
vanish
and
we
drove
away
is
impossible
to
forget
that
which
has
not
been
called
out
the
dissatisfied
man
as
august
passed
him
is
what
i
say
it
is
what
i
say
cried
august
irritated
nothing
could
have
kept
me
in
putbus
after
this
skirting
the
circus
on
the
south
side
we
turned
down
a
hill
to
the
right
and
immediately
were
in
the
country
again
with
cornfields
on
either
side
and
the
sea
like
a
liquid
sapphire
beyond
them
gertrud
and
i
put
a
coat
between
us
in
place
of
the
abandoned
and
settled
in
with
an
appreciation
of
our
comforts
that
we
had
not
had
before
gertrud
indeed
looked
positively
happy
so
thankful
was
she
to
be
safely
in
the
carriage
again
and
joy
was
written
in
every
line
of
august
back
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
lay
lauterbach
a
little
straggling
group
of
houses
down
by
the
water
and
quite
by
itself
a
mile
to
the
left
of
lauterbach
i
could
see
the
hotel
we
were
going
to
a
long
white
building
something
like
a
greek
temple
with
a
portico
and
a
flight
of
steps
the
entire
length
of
its
façade
conspicuous
in
its
whiteness
against
a
background
of
beechwoods
woods
and
fields
and
sea
and
a
lovely
little
island
a
short
way
from
the
shore
called
vilm
were
bathed
in
sunset
splendour
lauterbach
and
not
putbus
then
was
the
place
of
radiant
and
crystal
water
and
wooded
coves
probably
in
those
distant
years
when
marianne
north
enjoyed
them
lauterbach
as
an
independent
village
with
a
name
to
itself
did
not
exist
a
branch
railway
goes
down
now
to
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
we
crossed
the
line
and
drove
between
chestnut
trees
and
high
grassy
banks
starry
with
flowers
to
the
greek
hotel
how
delightful
it
looked
as
we
got
out
of
the
deep
chestnut
lane
into
the
open
space
in
front
of
it
before
we
were
close
enough
to
see
that
time
had
been
unkind
the
sea
was
within
a
stone
throw
on
the
right
beyond
a
green
marshy
rushy
meadow
on
the
left
people
were
mowing
in
a
field
across
the
field
the
spire
of
a
little
lutheran
church
looked
out
oddly
round
the
end
of
the
pagan
portico
behind
and
on
either
side
were
beeches
not
a
soul
came
out
as
we
drew
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
except
the
souls
with
scythes
in
the
meadow
we
waited
a
moment
thinking
to
hear
a
bell
rung
and
to
see
flying
waiters
but
no
one
came
the
scythes
in
the
meadow
swished
the
larks
called
down
that
it
was
a
fine
evening
some
fowls
came
and
pecked
about
on
the
sunny
steps
of
the
temple
some
red
sails
passed
between
the
trunks
of
the
willows
down
near
the
water
i
go
in
inquired
gertrud
she
went
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
through
glass
doors
grass
grew
between
the
stones
of
the
steps
and
the
walls
of
the
house
were
damp
and
green
the
ceiling
of
the
portico
was
divided
into
squares
and
painted
in
one
corner
paint
and
plaster
had
come
off
together
probably
in
wild
winter
nights
and
this
and
the
steps
and
the
silence
gave
the
place
a
strangely
deserted
look
i
would
have
thought
it
was
shut
up
if
there
had
not
been
a
table
in
the
portico
with
a
reassuring
cloth
on
it
and
a
gertrud
came
out
again
followed
by
a
waiter
and
a
small
boy
i
was
in
no
hurry
and
could
have
sat
there
contentedly
for
any
time
in
the
pleasant
evening
sunshine
the
waiter
assured
me
there
was
just
one
room
vacant
for
me
and
by
the
luckiest
of
chances
just
one
other
leading
out
of
it
for
the
fräulein
i
followed
him
up
the
steps
the
portico
open
at
either
end
framed
in
delicious
pictures
the
waiter
led
me
through
a
spacious
boarded
hall
where
a
narrow
table
along
one
side
told
of
recent
supper
through
intricate
passages
across
little
inner
courts
with
shrubs
and
greenery
and
blue
sky
above
and
lilac
bushes
in
tubs
looking
as
though
they
had
to
pretend
they
were
orange
trees
and
that
this
was
italy
and
that
the
white
plaster
walls
so
mouldy
in
places
were
the
marble
walls
of
some
classic
baths
up
strange
stairs
that
sloped
alarmingly
to
one
side
along
more
passages
and
throwing
open
one
of
the
many
small
white
doors
said
with
pride
is
the
apartment
it
is
a
fine
a
big
a
splendid
apartment
the
apartment
was
of
the
sort
that
produces
an
immediate
determination
in
the
breast
of
him
to
whom
it
is
offered
to
die
sooner
than
occupy
it
sleep
in
its
gloomy
recesses
and
bed
i
would
not
sooner
would
i
brave
the
authorities
and
taking
my
for
a
pillow
go
out
to
the
grasshoppers
for
the
night
in
spite
of
the
assertion
made
for
the
glory
of
the
house
that
this
was
the
one
room
unoccupied
i
saw
other
rooms
perhaps
smaller
but
certainly
vacant
lurking
in
his
eye
therefore
i
said
firmly
me
something
else
the
house
was
nearly
all
at
my
disposal
i
found
it
is
roomy
and
there
were
hardly
a
dozen
people
staying
in
it
i
chose
a
room
with
windows
opening
into
the
portico
through
whose
white
columns
i
would
be
able
to
see
a
series
of
peaceful
country
pictures
as
i
lay
in
bed
the
boards
were
bare
and
the
bed
was
covered
with
another
of
those
quilts
that
suggest
a
desire
to
dissemble
spots
rather
than
wash
them
out
the
greek
temple
was
certainly
primitive
and
would
hardly
appeal
to
any
but
the
simplest
meekest
of
tourists
i
hope
i
am
simple
and
meek
i
felt
as
though
i
must
be
as
i
looked
round
this
room
and
knew
that
of
my
own
free
will
i
was
going
to
sleep
in
it
and
not
only
sleep
in
it
but
be
very
happy
in
it
it
was
the
series
of
pictures
between
the
columns
that
had
fascinated
me
while
gertrud
was
downstairs
superintending
the
bringing
up
of
the
luggage
i
leaned
out
of
one
of
my
windows
and
examined
the
delights
i
was
quite
close
to
the
blue
and
white
squares
of
the
portico
ceiling
and
looking
down
i
saw
its
pavement
and
the
head
of
a
pensive
tourist
drinking
beer
just
beneath
me
here
again
big
lilac
bushes
planted
at
intervals
between
the
columns
did
duty
for
orange
trees
the
north
end
framed
the
sky
and
fields
and
distant
church
the
south
end
had
a
picture
of
luminous
water
shining
through
beech
leaves
the
pair
of
columns
in
front
enclosed
the
road
we
had
come
along
and
the
outermost
white
houses
of
putbus
among
dark
trees
against
the
sunset
on
high
ground
behind
through
those
on
the
left
was
the
sea
hardly
sea
here
at
all
the
bay
is
so
sheltered
and
hardly
salt
at
all
for
grass
and
rushes
touched
just
then
by
the
splendour
of
light
into
a
transient
divine
brightness
lay
all
along
the
shore
the
light
is
sweet
and
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
for
the
eyes
to
behold
the
sun
i
thought
aloud
i
suppose
for
gertrud
coming
in
with
the
said
the
gracious
one
speak
quite
unable
to
repeat
this
rapturous
conviction
to
gertrud
i
changed
it
into
a
modest
request
that
she
should
order
supper
how
often
in
these
grey
autumn
days
have
i
turned
my
face
away
from
the
rain
on
the
window
and
the
mournful
mistiness
of
the
november
fields
or
my
mind
from
the
talk
of
the
person
next
to
me
to
think
with
a
smile
of
the
beauty
of
that
supper
not
that
i
had
beautiful
things
to
eat
for
lengthy
consultations
with
the
waiter
led
only
to
eggs
but
they
were
brought
down
steep
steps
to
a
little
nook
among
the
beeches
at
the
water
edge
and
this
little
nook
on
that
particular
evening
was
the
loveliest
in
the
world
enthusiastically
did
i
eat
those
eggs
and
murmur
has
not
anything
to
show
more
fair
as
much
that
is
of
it
as
could
be
made
to
apply
nobody
could
see
me
or
hear
me
down
there
screened
at
the
sides
and
back
and
overhead
by
the
beeches
and
it
is
an
immense
comfort
secretly
to
quote
what
did
it
matter
if
the
tablecloth
were
damp
besides
having
other
imperfections
what
if
the
eggs
cooled
down
at
once
and
cool
eggs
have
always
been
an
abomination
to
me
what
if
the
waiter
forgot
the
sugar
and
i
dislike
coffee
without
sugar
sooner
than
go
up
and
search
for
him
and
lose
one
moment
of
that
rosy
splendour
on
the
water
i
felt
that
i
would
go
for
ever
sugarless
my
table
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
sea
a
family
of
ducks
were
slowly
paddling
about
in
front
of
me
making
little
furrows
in
the
quiet
water
and
giving
an
occasional
placid
quack
the
ducks
the
water
the
island
of
vilm
opposite
the
lauterbach
jetty
half
a
mile
off
across
the
little
bay
with
a
crowd
of
moored
near
it
all
were
on
fire
with
the
same
red
radiance
the
sun
was
just
down
and
the
sky
behind
the
dark
putbus
woods
was
a
marvel
of
solemn
glory
the
reflections
of
the
beech
trees
i
was
sitting
under
lay
black
along
the
water
i
could
hear
the
fishermen
talking
over
at
the
jetty
and
a
child
calling
on
the
island
so
absolute
was
the
stillness
and
almost
before
i
knew
how
beautiful
it
was
the
rosiness
faded
off
the
island
lingered
a
moment
longer
on
the
masts
of
the
gathered
at
last
only
in
the
pools
among
the
rushes
died
away
altogether
the
sky
paled
to
green
a
few
stars
looked
out
faintly
a
light
twinkled
in
the
solitary
house
on
vilm
and
the
waiter
came
down
and
asked
if
he
should
bring
a
lamp
a
lamp
as
though
all
one
ever
wanted
was
to
see
the
tiny
circle
round
oneself
to
be
able
to
read
the
evening
paper
or
write
postcards
to
one
friends
or
sew
i
have
a
peculiar
capacity
for
doing
nothing
and
yet
enjoying
myself
to
sit
there
and
look
out
into
what
whitman
calls
the
huge
and
thoughtful
night
was
a
comely
and
sufficient
occupation
for
the
best
part
of
me
and
as
for
the
rest
the
inferior
or
domestic
part
the
fingers
that
might
have
been
busy
the
tongue
that
might
have
wagged
the
superficial
bit
of
brain
in
daily
use
for
the
planning
of
trivialities
how
good
it
is
that
all
that
should
often
be
idle
with
an
impatience
that
surprised
him
i
refused
the
waiter
lamp
the
second
day
lauterbach
and
vilm
a
ripe
experience
of
german
pillows
in
country
places
leads
me
to
urge
the
intending
traveller
to
be
sure
to
take
his
own
the
native
pillows
are
mere
bags
in
which
feathers
may
have
been
once
there
is
no
substance
in
them
at
all
they
are
of
a
horrid
flabbiness
and
they
have
of
course
the
common
drawback
of
all
public
pillows
they
are
haunted
by
the
nightmares
of
other
people
a
pillow
it
is
true
takes
up
a
great
deal
of
room
in
one
luggage
but
in
rügen
however
simply
you
dress
you
are
better
dressed
than
the
others
so
that
you
need
take
hardly
any
clothes
my
not
a
specially
big
one
really
did
hold
all
i
wanted
the
pillow
filled
one
side
of
it
and
my
bathing
things
a
great
part
of
the
other
and
i
was
away
eleven
days
yet
i
am
sure
i
was
admirably
clean
the
whole
time
and
i
defy
any
one
to
say
my
garments
were
not
both
appropriate
and
irreproachable
towards
the
end
it
is
true
gertrud
had
to
mend
and
brush
a
good
deal
but
those
are
two
of
the
things
she
is
there
for
and
it
is
infinitely
better
to
be
comfortable
at
night
than
by
leaving
the
pillow
at
home
and
bringing
dresses
in
its
place
be
more
impressive
by
day
and
let
no
one
visit
rügen
who
is
not
of
that
meek
and
lowly
character
that
would
always
prefer
a
good
pillow
to
a
diversity
of
raiment
and
has
no
prejudices
about
its
food
having
eased
my
conscience
by
these
hints
which
he
will
find
invaluable
to
the
traveller
i
can
now
go
on
to
say
that
except
for
the
pillow
i
would
have
had
if
i
had
not
brought
my
own
for
the
coloured
quilt
for
the
water
to
wash
with
brought
in
a
very
small
and
for
the
breakfast
which
was
as
cold
and
repellent
as
in
some
moods
some
persons
find
the
world
my
experiences
of
the
hotel
were
pleasing
it
is
true
that
i
spent
most
of
the
day
as
i
shall
presently
relate
away
from
it
and
it
is
also
true
that
in
the
searching
light
of
morning
i
saw
much
that
had
been
hidden
scraps
of
paper
lying
about
the
grass
near
the
house
an
automatic
machine
in
the
form
of
a
brooding
hen
and
an
automatic
weighing
machine
both
at
the
top
of
the
very
steps
leading
down
to
the
nook
that
had
been
the
night
before
enchanted
and
worst
shock
of
all
an
electric
bell
piercing
the
heart
of
the
very
beech
tree
under
which
i
had
sat
but
the
beauties
are
so
many
and
so
great
that
if
a
few
of
them
are
spoilt
there
are
still
enough
left
to
make
lauterbach
one
of
the
most
delightful
places
conceivable
the
hotel
was
admirably
quiet
no
tourists
arrived
late
and
those
already
in
it
seemed
to
go
to
bed
extraordinarily
early
for
when
i
came
up
from
the
water
soon
after
ten
the
house
was
so
silent
that
instinctively
i
stole
along
the
passages
on
the
tips
of
my
toes
and
for
no
reason
that
i
could
discover
felt
gertrud
too
appeared
to
think
it
was
unusually
late
she
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
with
a
lamp
and
seemed
to
expect
me
to
look
also
she
had
rather
the
expression
of
the
resigned
and
forgiving
wife
of
an
incorrigible
i
went
into
my
room
much
pleased
that
i
am
not
a
man
and
need
not
have
a
wife
who
forgives
me
the
windows
were
left
wide
open
and
all
night
through
my
dreams
i
could
hear
the
sea
gently
rippling
among
the
rushes
at
six
in
the
morning
a
train
down
at
the
station
hidden
behind
the
chestnuts
began
to
shunt
and
to
whistle
and
as
it
did
not
leave
off
and
i
could
not
sleep
till
it
did
i
got
up
and
sat
at
the
window
and
amused
myself
watching
the
pictures
between
the
columns
in
the
morning
sunlight
a
solitary
mower
in
the
meadow
was
very
busy
with
his
scythe
but
its
swishing
could
not
be
heard
through
the
shunting
at
last
the
train
steamed
away
and
peace
settled
down
again
over
lauterbach
the
scythe
swished
audibly
the
larks
sang
rapturously
and
i
fell
to
saying
my
prayers
for
indeed
it
was
a
day
to
be
grateful
for
and
the
sea
was
the
deepest
divinest
blue
the
bathing
at
lauterbach
is
certainly
perfect
you
walk
along
a
footpath
on
the
edge
of
low
cliffs
shaded
all
the
way
from
the
door
of
the
hotel
to
the
by
the
beechwood
the
water
heaving
and
shining
just
below
you
the
island
of
vilm
opposite
the
distant
headland
of
thiessow
a
hazy
violet
line
between
the
misty
blues
of
sea
and
sky
in
front
and
at
your
feet
moss
and
grass
and
dear
common
flowers
flecked
with
the
dancing
lights
and
shadows
of
a
beechwood
when
the
sun
is
shining
this
is
perfect
i
exclaimed
to
gertrud
for
on
a
fine
fresh
morning
one
must
exclaim
to
somebody
she
was
behind
me
on
the
narrow
path
her
arms
full
of
towels
and
bathing
things
you
bathe
too
afterwards
gertrud
can
you
resist
it
but
gertrud
evidently
could
resist
it
very
well
she
glanced
at
the
living
loveliness
of
the
sea
with
an
eye
that
clearly
saw
in
it
only
a
thing
that
made
dry
people
wet
if
she
had
been
johnson
she
would
boldly
have
answered
i
hate
immersion
being
gertrud
she
pretended
that
she
had
a
cold
then
i
said
hopefully
but
she
said
colds
hung
about
her
for
days
as
soon
as
you
have
got
over
it
i
said
persistently
and
odiously
hopeful
but
she
became
prophetic
and
said
she
would
never
get
over
it
the
are
in
a
row
far
enough
away
from
the
shore
to
be
in
deep
water
you
walk
out
to
them
along
a
little
footbridge
of
planks
and
find
a
sunburnt
woman
amiable
as
all
the
people
seem
to
be
who
have
their
business
in
deep
waters
and
she
takes
care
of
your
things
and
dries
them
for
you
and
provides
you
with
anything
you
have
forgotten
and
charges
you
twenty
at
the
end
for
all
her
attentions
as
well
as
the
bathe
the
farthest
hut
is
the
one
to
get
if
you
can
another
invaluable
hint
it
is
very
roomy
and
has
a
sofa
a
table
and
a
big
and
one
window
opening
to
the
south
and
one
to
the
east
through
the
east
window
you
see
the
line
of
low
cliffs
with
the
woods
above
till
they
melt
into
a
green
plain
that
stretches
off
into
vagueness
towards
the
haze
of
thiessow
through
the
south
window
you
see
the
little
island
of
vilm
with
its
one
house
set
about
with
cornfields
and
its
woods
on
the
high
ground
at
the
back
gertrud
sat
on
the
steps
knitting
while
i
swam
round
among
the
and
thought
of
marianne
north
how
right
she
was
about
the
bathing
and
the
colours
and
the
crystal
clearness
of
the
water
in
that
sandy
cove
the
bathing
woman
leaned
over
the
watching
me
with
a
sympathetic
smile
she
wore
a
white
and
it
looked
so
well
against
the
sky
that
i
wished
gertrud
could
be
persuaded
to
put
one
on
too
in
place
of
her
uninteresting
and
eminently
respectable
black
bonnet
i
could
have
stayed
there
for
hours
perfectly
happy
floating
on
the
sparkling
stuff
and
i
did
stay
there
for
nearly
one
with
the
result
that
i
climbed
up
the
cliff
a
chilled
and
saddened
woman
and
sat
contemplating
the
blue
tips
of
my
fingers
while
the
waiter
brought
breakfast
and
thought
what
a
pitiful
thing
it
was
to
have
blue
finger
tips
instead
of
rejoicing
as
i
would
have
done
after
a
ten
swim
in
the
glorious
fact
that
i
was
alive
at
all
on
such
a
morning
the
cold
tea
cold
eggs
and
hard
rolls
did
not
make
me
more
cheerful
i
sat
under
the
beeches
where
i
had
had
supper
the
night
before
and
shivered
in
my
thickest
coat
with
the
july
sun
blazing
on
the
water
and
striking
brilliant
colours
out
of
the
sails
of
the
passing
the
hotel
dog
came
along
the
shingle
with
his
tongue
out
and
lay
down
near
me
in
the
shade
visitors
from
putbus
arriving
in
an
omnibus
for
their
morning
bathe
passed
by
fanning
themselves
with
their
hats
the
putbus
visitors
come
down
every
morning
in
a
sort
of
waggonette
to
bathe
and
walk
back
slowly
up
the
hill
to
dinner
after
this
exertion
they
think
they
have
done
enough
for
their
health
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
sleeping
or
sitting
out
of
doors
drinking
beer
and
coffee
i
think
this
is
quite
a
good
way
of
spending
a
holiday
if
you
have
worked
hard
all
the
rest
of
the
year
and
the
tourists
i
saw
looked
as
if
they
had
more
of
them
stay
at
putbus
than
at
lauterbach
although
it
is
so
much
farther
from
the
sea
because
the
hotel
i
was
at
was
slightly
dearer
than
i
ought
rather
to
say
judging
from
the
not
quite
so
cheap
as
the
putbus
hotels
i
suppose
it
was
less
full
than
it
might
be
because
of
this
slight
difference
or
perhaps
there
was
the
slight
difference
because
it
was
less
full
who
shall
solve
such
mysteries
anyhow
the
traveller
need
not
be
afraid
of
the
bill
for
when
i
engaged
our
rooms
the
waiter
was
surprised
that
i
refused
to
put
myself
and
explained
in
quite
an
aggrieved
voice
that
all
the
put
themselves
and
he
hoped
i
did
not
think
five
marks
a
day
for
everything
a
too
expensive
arrangement
i
praised
the
arrangement
as
just
and
excellent
but
said
that
being
a
bird
of
passage
i
would
prefer
not
to
make
it
after
breakfast
i
set
out
to
explore
the
goor
the
lovely
beechwood
stretching
along
the
coast
from
the
very
doors
of
the
hotel
i
started
so
briskly
down
the
footpath
on
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
in
the
hope
of
getting
warm
that
tourists
who
were
warm
already
and
were
sitting
under
the
trees
gasping
stared
at
me
reproachfully
as
i
hurried
past
the
goor
is
beautiful
the
path
i
took
runs
through
thick
shade
with
many
windings
and
presently
comes
out
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
down
by
the
sea
in
a
very
hot
sheltered
corner
where
the
sun
beats
all
day
long
on
the
shingle
and
coarse
grass
a
solitary
oak
tree
old
and
stands
by
itself
near
the
water
across
the
water
is
the
wooded
side
of
vilm
and
if
you
continue
along
the
shingle
a
few
yards
you
are
away
from
the
trees
and
out
on
a
grassy
plain
where
lilac
scabious
bend
their
delicate
stalks
in
the
wind
an
old
black
lay
on
its
side
on
the
shingle
its
boards
blistered
by
the
sun
its
blackness
and
the
dark
lines
of
the
solitary
oak
sharply
cleft
the
flood
of
brilliant
light
what
a
hot
happy
corner
to
lie
in
all
day
with
a
book
no
tourists
go
to
it
for
the
path
leads
to
nowhere
ending
abruptly
just
there
in
coarse
grass
and
shingle
a
mixture
grievous
to
the
feet
of
the
easily
tired
the
usual
walk
for
those
who
have
enough
energy
it
is
not
a
very
long
one
and
does
not
need
much
is
through
the
goor
to
the
north
side
where
the
path
takes
you
to
the
edge
of
a
clover
field
across
which
you
see
the
little
village
of
vilmnitz
nestling
among
its
trees
and
rye
and
then
brings
you
back
gently
and
comfortably
and
shadily
to
the
hotel
but
this
turning
to
the
right
only
goes
down
to
the
shingle
the
old
boat
and
the
lonely
oak
the
first
thing
to
do
in
that
hot
corner
is
to
pull
off
your
coat
which
i
did
and
if
you
like
heat
and
dislike
blue
finger
tips
and
chilled
marrows
lie
down
on
the
shingle
draw
your
hat
over
your
eyes
and
bake
luxuriously
which
i
did
also
in
the
pocket
of
my
coat
was
the
only
book
i
had
brought
i
brought
it
because
i
know
of
no
other
book
that
is
at
the
same
time
so
slender
and
so
satisfying
it
slips
even
into
a
woman
pocket
and
has
an
extraordinarily
filling
effect
on
the
mind
its
green
limp
covers
are
quite
worn
with
the
journeys
it
has
been
with
me
i
take
it
wherever
i
go
and
i
have
read
it
and
read
it
for
many
summers
without
yet
having
entirely
assimilated
its
adorable
stodginess
oh
shade
of
wordsworth
to
think
that
so
unutterable
a
grub
and
groveller
as
i
am
should
dare
call
anything
of
thine
stodgy
but
it
is
this
very
stodginess
that
makes
it
if
you
love
wordsworth
the
perfect
book
where
there
can
be
only
one
you
must
to
enjoy
it
be
first
a
lover
of
wordsworth
you
must
love
the
uninspired
poems
for
the
sake
of
the
divineness
of
the
inspired
poems
you
must
be
able
to
be
interested
in
the
description
of
simon
personal
appearance
and
not
mind
his
wife
an
aged
woman
being
made
to
rhyme
with
the
village
common
even
the
idiot
boy
should
not
be
a
to
you
and
your
having
learned
the
pet
lamb
in
the
nursery
is
no
reason
why
you
should
dislike
it
now
they
all
have
their
beauties
there
is
always
some
gem
more
or
less
bright
to
be
found
in
them
and
the
pages
of
are
strewn
with
precious
jewels
i
have
had
it
with
me
so
often
in
happy
country
places
that
merely
to
open
it
and
read
that
first
cry
of
relief
and
delight
there
is
blessing
in
this
gentle
breeze
brings
back
the
dearest
remembrances
of
fresh
and
joyous
hours
and
how
wholesome
to
be
reminded
when
the
days
are
rainy
and
things
look
blank
of
the
many
joyous
hours
one
has
had
every
instant
of
happiness
is
a
priceless
possession
for
ever
that
morning
my
fell
open
at
the
residence
in
london
a
part
where
the
gems
are
not
very
thick
and
the
satisfying
properties
extremely
developed
my
eye
lighted
on
the
bit
where
he
goes
for
a
walk
in
the
london
streets
and
besides
a
nurse
a
bachelor
a
military
idler
and
a
dame
with
decent
steps
figures
with
which
i
too
am
familiar
he
sees
with
basket
at
his
breast
the
jew
the
stately
and
turk
with
freight
of
slipper
piled
beneath
his
arm
the
swede
the
russian
from
the
genial
south
the
frenchman
and
the
spaniard
from
remote
america
the
moors
malays
lascars
the
tartar
the
chinese
and
negro
ladies
in
white
muslin
gowns
figures
which
are
not
at
any
rate
to
be
met
in
the
streets
of
berlin
i
am
afraid
to
say
that
this
is
not
poetry
for
perhaps
it
is
only
i
do
not
know
it
but
after
all
one
can
only
judge
according
to
one
lights
and
no
degree
of
faintness
and
imperfection
in
the
lights
will
ever
stop
any
one
from
judging
therefore
i
will
have
the
courage
of
my
opinions
and
express
my
firm
conviction
that
it
is
not
poetry
at
all
but
the
passage
set
me
off
musing
that
is
the
pleasant
property
of
it
makes
one
at
the
end
of
every
few
lines
pause
and
muse
and
presently
the
image
of
the
negro
ladies
in
their
white
muslin
gowns
faded
and
those
other
lines
children
of
the
spirit
but
conceived
in
the
mood
when
it
was
divine
stood
out
in
shining
letters
not
in
entire
forgetfulness
and
not
in
utter
nakedness
i
need
not
go
on
it
is
sacrilege
to
write
them
down
in
such
a
setting
of
commonplaceness
i
could
not
say
them
aloud
to
my
closest
friend
with
a
steady
voice
they
are
lines
that
seem
to
come
fresh
from
god
and
now
i
know
that
the
negro
ladies
whatever
their
exact
poetic
value
may
be
have
become
a
very
real
blessing
to
an
obscure
inhabitant
of
prussia
for
in
the
future
i
shall
only
need
to
see
the
passage
to
be
back
instantaneously
on
the
hot
shingle
with
the
tarred
edge
of
the
old
boat
above
me
against
the
sky
the
blue
water
curling
along
the
shore
at
my
feet
and
the
pale
lilac
flowers
on
the
delicate
stalks
bending
their
heads
in
the
wind
about
twelve
the
sun
drove
me
away
the
backs
of
my
hands
began
to
feel
as
though
they
proposed
to
go
into
blisters
i
could
not
lie
there
and
deliberately
be
blistered
so
i
got
up
and
wandered
back
to
the
hotel
to
prepare
gertrud
for
a
probably
prolonged
absence
as
i
intended
to
get
across
somehow
to
the
island
of
vilm
having
begged
her
to
keep
calm
if
i
did
not
appear
again
till
bedtime
i
took
the
and
set
out
the
way
to
the
jetty
is
down
a
path
through
the
meadow
close
to
the
water
with
willows
on
one
side
of
it
and
rushes
on
the
other
in
ten
minutes
you
have
reached
lauterbach
seen
some
ugly
little
new
houses
where
tourists
lodge
seen
some
delightful
little
old
houses
where
fishermen
live
paid
ten
toll
to
a
smiling
woman
at
the
entrance
to
the
jetty
on
whom
it
is
useless
to
waste
amiabilities
she
being
absolutely
deaf
and
having
walked
out
to
the
end
begin
to
wonder
how
you
are
to
get
across
there
were
at
anchor
on
one
side
and
a
brig
from
sweden
was
being
unloaded
a
small
steamer
lay
at
the
end
looking
as
though
it
meant
to
start
soon
for
somewhere
but
on
my
asking
an
official
who
was
sitting
on
a
coil
of
ropes
staring
at
nothing
if
it
would
take
me
to
vilm
he
replied
that
he
did
not
go
to
vilm
but
would
be
pleased
to
take
me
to
baabe
never
having
heard
of
baabe
i
had
no
desire
to
go
to
it
he
then
suggested
greifswald
and
said
he
went
there
the
next
day
and
when
i
declined
to
be
taken
to
greifswald
the
next
day
instead
of
to
vilm
that
day
he
looked
as
though
he
thought
me
unreasonable
and
relapsed
into
his
first
abstraction
a
fisherman
was
lounging
near
leaning
against
one
of
the
posts
and
also
staring
straight
into
space
and
when
i
turned
away
he
roused
himself
enough
to
ask
if
i
would
use
his
smack
he
pointed
to
it
where
it
lay
a
little
way
out
a
big
boat
with
the
bright
brown
sails
that
make
such
brilliant
splashes
of
colour
in
the
surrounding
blues
and
whites
there
was
only
a
faint
breeze
but
he
said
he
could
get
me
across
in
twenty
minutes
and
would
wait
for
me
all
day
if
i
liked
and
would
only
charge
three
marks
three
marks
for
a
whole
with
golden
sails
and
a
fisherman
with
a
golden
beard
blue
eyes
stalwart
body
and
whose
remote
grandparents
had
certainly
been
vikings
i
got
into
his
dinghy
without
further
argument
and
was
rowed
across
to
the
smack
a
small
viking
appropriately
beardless
he
being
only
ten
but
with
freckles
put
his
head
out
of
the
cabin
as
we
drew
alongside
and
was
presented
to
me
as
the
eldest
of
five
sons
father
and
son
made
a
comfortable
place
for
me
in
a
not
too
fishy
part
of
the
boat
hauled
up
the
huge
poetic
sail
and
we
glided
out
beyond
the
jetty
this
is
the
proper
way
the
only
right
way
to
visit
vilm
the
most
romantic
of
tiny
islands
who
would
go
to
it
any
other
way
but
with
a
viking
and
a
golden
sail
yet
there
is
another
way
i
found
out
and
it
is
the
one
most
used
it
is
a
small
launch
plying
between
lauterbach
and
vilm
worked
by
a
machine
that
smells
very
nasty
and
makes
a
great
noise
and
as
it
is
a
long
narrow
boat
if
there
are
even
small
waves
it
rolls
so
much
that
the
female
passengers
and
sometimes
even
the
male
scream
also
the
spray
flies
over
it
and
drenches
you
in
calm
weather
it
crosses
swiftly
doing
the
distance
in
ten
minutes
my
smack
took
twenty
to
get
there
and
much
longer
to
get
back
but
what
a
difference
in
the
joy
the
puffing
little
launch
rushed
past
us
when
we
were
midway
when
i
should
not
have
known
that
we
were
moving
but
for
the
slight
shining
ripple
across
the
bows
and
the
thud
of
its
machine
and
the
smell
of
its
benzine
were
noticeable
for
a
long
time
after
it
had
dwindled
to
a
dot
the
people
in
it
certainly
got
to
their
destination
quickly
but
vilm
is
not
a
place
to
hurry
to
there
is
nothing
whatever
on
it
to
attract
the
hurried
to
rush
across
the
sea
to
it
and
back
again
to
one
train
at
lauterbach
is
not
to
have
felt
its
singular
charm
it
is
a
place
to
dream
away
a
summer
in
but
the
tourist
visiting
it
between
two
trains
would
hardly
know
how
to
fill
up
the
three
hours
allotted
him
you
can
walk
right
round
it
in
of
an
hour
in
of
an
hour
you
can
have
seen
each
of
the
views
considered
fine
and
accordingly
provided
with
a
seat
have
said
there
is
thiessow
again
on
looking
over
the
sea
to
the
east
and
there
is
putbus
again
on
looking
over
the
sea
to
the
west
and
that
must
be
greifswald
on
remarking
far
away
in
the
south
the
spires
of
churches
rising
up
out
of
the
water
you
will
have
had
ample
time
to
smile
at
the
primitiveness
of
the
on
the
east
shore
to
study
the
names
of
past
bathers
scribbled
over
it
besides
poems
valedictory
addresses
and
quotations
from
the
german
classics
to
sit
for
a
little
on
the
rocks
thinking
how
hard
rocks
are
and
at
length
to
wander
round
in
sheer
inability
to
fill
up
the
last
hour
to
the
inn
the
only
house
on
the
island
where
at
one
of
the
tables
under
the
chestnuts
before
the
door
you
would
probably
drink
beer
till
the
launch
starts
but
that
is
not
the
way
to
enjoy
vilm
if
you
love
beauty
wide
stretches
of
sea
and
sky
mighty
beeches
dense
bracken
meadows
radiant
with
flowers
chalky
levels
purple
with
gentians
solitude
and
economy
go
and
spend
a
summer
at
vilm
the
inn
is
kept
by
one
of
prince
putbus
foresters
or
rather
by
his
amiable
and
obliging
wife
the
forester
functions
being
apparently
restricted
to
standing
picturesquely
propped
against
a
tree
in
front
of
the
house
in
a
nice
green
shooting
suit
with
a
telescope
at
his
eye
through
which
he
studies
the
approaching
or
departing
launch
his
wife
does
the
rest
i
sat
at
one
of
the
tables
beneath
the
chestnuts
waiting
for
my
food
i
had
to
wait
a
very
long
while
and
she
came
out
and
talked
the
season
she
explained
was
short
lasting
two
months
july
and
august
at
the
longest
so
that
her
prices
were
necessarily
high
i
inquired
what
they
were
and
she
said
five
marks
a
day
for
a
front
room
looking
over
the
sea
and
four
marks
and
a
half
for
a
back
room
looking
over
the
forest
the
price
including
four
meals
out
of
the
season
her
charges
were
lower
she
said
most
of
her
visitors
were
painters
and
she
could
put
up
with
their
wives
my
luncheon
came
while
she
was
still
trying
to
find
out
if
i
were
a
female
painter
and
if
not
why
i
was
there
alone
instead
of
being
one
of
a
batch
after
the
manner
of
the
and
i
will
only
say
of
the
luncheon
that
it
was
abundant
its
quality
after
all
did
not
matter
much
the
rye
grew
up
to
within
a
yard
of
my
table
and
made
a
quivering
golden
line
of
light
against
the
blue
sparkle
of
the
sea
white
butterflies
danced
above
it
the
breeze
coming
over
it
blew
sweet
country
smells
in
my
face
the
chestnut
leaves
shading
me
rustled
and
whispered
all
the
world
was
gay
and
fresh
and
scented
and
if
the
traveller
does
not
think
these
delights
make
up
for
doubtful
cookery
why
does
he
travel
the
insisted
on
showing
me
the
bedrooms
they
are
simple
and
very
clean
each
one
with
a
beautiful
view
the
rest
of
the
house
including
the
does
not
lend
itself
to
enthusiastic
description
i
saw
the
long
table
at
which
the
painters
eat
they
were
doing
it
when
i
looked
in
and
had
been
doing
it
the
whole
time
i
was
under
the
chestnuts
it
was
not
because
of
the
many
dishes
that
they
sat
there
so
long
but
because
of
the
few
waiters
there
were
at
least
forty
people
learning
to
be
patient
and
one
waiter
and
a
boy
to
drive
the
lesson
home
the
bathing
too
at
vilm
can
not
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
the
glorious
bathing
at
lauterbach
there
is
no
smiling
attendant
in
a
white
sunbonnet
waiting
to
take
your
things
and
dry
them
to
rub
you
down
when
you
come
out
shivering
and
if
needful
jump
in
and
pull
you
out
when
you
begin
to
drown
at
vilm
the
lies
on
the
east
shore
and
you
go
to
it
across
a
meadow
the
divinest
strip
of
meadow
it
is
true
with
sea
behind
you
and
sea
before
you
and
cattle
pasturing
and
a
general
radiant
air
about
it
as
though
at
any
moment
the
daughters
of
the
gods
might
come
over
the
buttercups
to
bleach
their
garments
whiter
in
the
sun
but
beautiful
as
it
is
it
is
a
very
hot
walk
and
there
is
no
path
except
the
path
through
the
rye
from
the
up
to
the
inn
there
is
not
a
regular
path
on
the
island
only
a
few
tracks
here
and
there
where
the
cows
are
driven
home
in
the
evening
and
to
reach
the
you
must
plunge
straight
through
and
not
mind
grasshoppers
hopping
into
your
clothes
then
the
water
is
so
shallow
just
there
that
you
must
wade
quite
a
distance
before
lying
down
it
will
cover
you
and
while
you
are
wading
altogether
unable
as
he
who
has
waded
knows
to
hurry
your
steps
however
urgent
the
need
you
blush
to
think
that
some
or
all
of
the
painters
are
probably
sitting
on
rocks
observing
you
wading
back
of
course
you
blush
still
more
i
never
saw
so
frank
a
it
is
beautiful
in
a
lovely
curve
cliffs
clothed
with
beeches
on
one
side
and
the
radiant
meadow
along
the
back
of
the
rocks
on
the
other
but
the
whole
island
can
see
you
if
you
go
out
far
enough
to
be
able
to
swim
and
if
you
do
not
you
are
still
a
conspicuous
object
and
a
very
miserable
one
bound
to
catch
any
wandering
eye
as
you
stand
there
alone
towering
out
of
water
that
washes
just
over
your
ankles
i
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
and
watched
two
girls
who
came
down
to
bathe
they
did
not
seem
to
feel
their
position
at
all
and
splashed
into
the
water
with
shrieks
and
laughter
that
rang
through
the
mellow
afternoon
air
so
it
was
that
i
saw
how
shallow
it
is
and
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
to
the
dignified
to
bathe
there
the
girls
had
no
dignity
and
were
not
embarrassed
probably
one
or
two
of
the
were
their
fathers
and
that
made
them
feel
at
home
or
perhaps
and
watching
them
i
began
to
think
that
this
was
so
they
would
rather
have
liked
to
be
looked
at
by
those
of
the
painters
who
were
not
their
fathers
anyhow
they
danced
and
laughed
and
called
to
each
other
often
glancing
back
inquiringly
at
the
cliffs
and
indeed
they
were
very
pretty
in
their
little
scarlet
suits
in
the
sapphire
frame
of
the
sea
i
sat
there
long
after
the
girls
were
clothed
and
transformed
into
quite
uninteresting
young
women
and
had
gone
their
way
noisily
up
the
grass
slope
into
the
shadows
of
the
beeches
the
afternoon
stillness
was
left
to
itself
again
undisturbed
by
anything
louder
than
the
slow
ripple
of
the
water
round
the
base
of
the
rocks
sometimes
a
rabbit
scuttled
up
the
side
of
the
cliff
and
once
a
hawk
cried
somewhere
up
among
the
little
clouds
the
shadows
grew
very
long
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
on
the
water
looked
as
though
they
would
stretch
across
to
thiessow
before
the
sun
had
done
with
them
out
at
sea
far
away
beyond
the
hazy
headland
a
long
streak
of
smoke
hung
above
the
track
where
a
steamer
had
passed
on
the
way
to
russia
i
wish
i
could
fill
my
soul
with
enough
of
the
serenity
of
such
afternoons
to
keep
it
sweet
for
ever
vilm
consists
of
two
wooded
hills
joined
together
by
a
long
narrow
flat
strip
of
land
this
strip
beyond
the
meadow
and
its
fringing
trees
is
covered
with
coarse
grass
and
stones
and
little
shells
clumps
of
wild
fruit
trees
scattered
about
it
here
and
there
look
as
if
they
knew
what
roughing
it
is
like
the
sea
washes
over
it
in
winter
when
the
wind
is
strong
from
the
east
and
among
the
trees
are
frequent
skeletons
dead
fruit
trees
these
many
seasons
past
with
the
tortured
look
peculiar
to
blasted
trees
menacing
the
sky
with
gaunt
impotent
arms
after
struggling
along
this
bit
stopping
every
few
minutes
to
shake
the
shells
out
of
my
shoes
i
came
to
uneven
ground
soft
green
grass
and
beautiful
trees
a
truly
lovely
part
at
the
foot
of
the
southern
hill
here
i
sat
down
for
a
moment
to
take
the
last
shells
out
of
my
shoes
and
to
drink
things
in
i
had
not
seen
a
soul
since
the
bathing
girls
and
supposed
that
most
of
the
people
staying
at
the
inn
would
not
care
on
hot
afternoons
to
walk
over
the
prickly
grass
and
shells
that
must
be
walked
over
before
reaching
the
green
coolness
of
the
end
and
while
i
was
comfortably
supposing
this
and
shaking
my
shoe
slowly
up
and
down
and
thinking
how
delightful
it
was
to
have
the
charming
place
to
myself
i
saw
a
young
man
standing
on
a
rock
under
the
east
cliff
of
the
hill
in
the
very
act
of
photographing
the
curving
strip
of
land
with
the
sea
each
side
of
it
and
myself
in
the
middle
now
i
am
not
of
those
who
like
being
photographed
much
and
often
at
intervals
that
grow
longer
i
go
through
the
process
at
the
instant
prayers
of
my
nearest
and
dearest
but
never
other
than
deliberately
after
due
choice
of
fitting
attitude
and
garments
the
kodak
and
the
instantaneous
photograph
taken
before
one
has
had
time
to
arrange
smile
are
things
to
be
regarded
with
abhorrence
by
every
woman
whose
faith
in
her
attractions
is
not
unshakeable
movements
so
graceful
that
the
early
victorians
would
have
described
them
as
those
early
victorians
who
wore
ringlets
curled
their
upper
lips
had
marble
brows
and
were
called
georgiana
movements
i
say
originally
in
grace
are
translated
by
the
irreverent
into
a
caricature
that
to
the
photographed
appears
not
even
remotely
like
and
fills
the
photographed
friends
with
an
awful
secret
joy
manner
of
young
man
is
this
i
asked
myself
examining
him
with
indignation
he
stood
on
the
rock
a
moment
looking
about
as
if
for
another
good
subject
and
finally
his
eye
alighted
on
me
then
he
got
off
his
rock
and
came
towards
me
manner
of
young
man
is
this
i
again
asked
myself
putting
on
my
shoe
in
haste
and
wrath
he
was
coming
to
apologise
i
supposed
having
secured
his
photograph
he
was
i
sat
gazing
severely
at
thiessow
there
is
no
running
away
from
vain
words
or
from
anything
else
on
an
island
he
was
a
tall
young
man
and
there
was
something
indefinable
and
reassuring
about
his
collar
am
so
sorry
he
said
with
great
politeness
did
not
notice
you
of
course
i
did
not
intend
to
photograph
you
i
shall
destroy
the
film
at
this
i
felt
hurt
being
photographed
without
permission
is
bad
but
being
told
your
photograph
is
not
wanted
and
will
be
destroyed
is
worse
he
was
a
very
personable
young
man
and
i
like
personable
young
men
from
the
way
he
spoke
german
and
from
his
collar
i
judged
him
english
and
i
like
englishmen
and
he
had
addressed
me
as
and
what
mother
of
a
growing
family
does
not
like
that
did
not
see
you
i
said
not
without
blandness
touched
by
his
youth
and
innocence
i
should
have
got
out
of
your
way
shall
destroy
the
film
he
again
assured
me
and
lifted
his
cap
and
went
back
to
the
rocks
now
if
i
stayed
where
i
was
he
could
not
photograph
the
strip
again
for
it
was
so
narrow
that
i
would
have
been
again
included
and
he
was
evidently
bent
on
getting
a
picture
of
it
and
fidgeted
about
among
the
rocks
waiting
for
me
to
go
so
i
went
and
as
i
climbed
up
the
south
hill
under
the
trees
i
mused
on
the
pleasant
slow
manners
of
englishmen
who
talk
and
move
as
though
life
were
very
spacious
and
time
may
as
well
wait
also
i
wondered
how
he
had
found
this
remote
island
i
was
inclined
to
wonder
that
i
had
found
it
myself
but
how
much
more
did
i
wonder
that
he
had
found
it
there
are
many
under
the
trees
at
the
south
end
of
vilm
and
i
disturbed
no
fewer
than
three
snakes
one
after
the
other
in
the
long
grass
they
were
of
the
harmless
kind
but
each
in
turn
made
me
jump
and
shiver
and
after
the
third
i
had
had
enough
and
clambered
down
the
cliff
on
the
west
side
and
went
along
at
the
foot
of
it
towards
the
farthest
point
of
the
island
with
the
innocent
intention
of
seeing
what
was
round
the
corner
the
young
man
was
round
the
corner
and
i
walked
straight
into
another
photograph
i
heard
the
camera
snap
at
the
very
instant
that
i
turned
the
bend
this
time
he
looked
at
me
with
something
of
a
grave
inquiry
in
his
eye
assure
you
i
do
not
to
be
photographed
i
said
hastily
hope
you
believe
that
i
did
not
intend
to
do
it
again
he
replied
am
very
sorry
said
i
shall
destroy
the
film
said
he
seems
a
great
waste
of
films
said
i
the
young
man
lifted
his
cap
i
continued
my
way
among
the
rocks
eastward
he
went
steadily
in
the
opposite
direction
round
the
other
side
of
the
hill
we
met
again
i
cried
genuinely
disturbed
i
spoilt
another
the
young
man
smiled
certainly
a
very
personable
young
man
and
explained
that
the
light
was
no
longer
strong
enough
to
do
any
more
again
in
this
explanation
did
he
call
me
gnädiges
fräulein
and
again
was
i
touched
by
so
much
innocence
and
his
german
too
was
touching
it
was
so
conscientiously
grammatical
so
laboriously
put
together
so
like
pieces
of
goethe
learned
by
heart
by
this
time
the
sun
hung
low
over
the
houses
of
putbus
and
the
strip
of
sand
with
its
coarse
grass
and
weatherbeaten
trees
was
turned
by
the
golden
flush
into
a
fairy
bridge
spanning
a
mystic
sea
joining
two
wonderful
shining
islands
we
walked
along
with
all
the
radiance
in
our
faces
it
is
as
i
have
observed
impossible
to
get
away
from
any
one
on
an
island
that
is
small
enough
we
were
both
going
back
to
the
inn
and
the
strip
of
land
is
narrow
therefore
we
went
together
and
what
that
young
man
talked
about
the
whole
way
in
the
most
ponderous
german
was
the
absolute
i
ca
think
what
i
have
done
that
i
should
be
talked
to
for
twenty
minutes
by
a
nice
young
man
who
mistook
me
for
a
fräulein
about
the
absolute
he
evidently
thought
the
innocence
of
him
that
being
german
i
must
whatever
my
sex
and
the
shape
of
my
head
be
interested
i
know
how
it
began
it
was
certainly
not
my
fault
for
till
that
day
i
had
had
no
definite
attitude
in
regard
to
it
of
course
i
did
not
tell
him
that
age
has
at
least
made
me
artful
a
real
fräulein
would
have
looked
as
vacant
as
she
felt
and
have
said
is
the
absolute
being
a
matron
and
artful
i
simply
looked
thoughtful
quite
an
easy
thing
to
do
and
said
do
you
define
it
he
said
he
defined
it
as
a
negation
of
the
conceivable
continuing
in
my
artfulness
i
said
that
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
that
view
of
it
and
asked
how
he
had
reached
his
conclusions
he
explained
elaborately
clearly
he
took
me
to
be
an
intelligent
fräulein
and
indeed
i
gave
myself
great
pains
to
look
like
one
it
appeared
that
he
had
a
vast
admiration
for
everything
german
and
especially
for
german
erudition
well
we
are
very
erudite
in
places
unfortunately
no
erudition
comes
up
my
way
my
acquaintances
do
not
ask
the
erudite
to
dinner
one
of
the
reasons
as
insufficient
as
the
rest
being
that
they
either
wear
day
clothes
in
the
evening
or
if
worldly
enough
to
dress
mar
the
effect
by
white
satin
ties
with
pins
in
them
and
another
is
that
they
are
liberals
and
therefore
uninvitable
when
the
unknown
youth
passing
naturally
from
kant
and
the
older
philosophers
to
the
great
germans
now
living
enthusiastically
mentioned
the
leading
lights
in
science
and
art
and
asked
if
i
knew
them
or
had
ever
seen
them
the
mere
seeing
of
them
he
seemed
to
think
would
be
a
privilege
i
could
only
murmur
no
how
impossible
to
explain
to
this
scion
of
an
unprejudiced
race
the
limitless
objection
of
the
class
called
i
am
a
female
to
mix
on
equal
terms
with
the
class
that
wears
white
satin
ties
in
the
evening
but
it
is
obvious
that
a
man
who
can
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
who
has
put
his
seal
on
his
century
and
who
will
be
remembered
when
we
have
returned
forgotten
to
the
prussian
dust
from
which
we
came
or
rather
not
forgotten
because
we
were
at
no
time
remembered
but
simply
ignored
it
is
obvious
that
such
a
man
may
wear
what
tie
he
pleases
when
he
comes
to
dine
and
still
ought
to
be
received
on
metaphorical
knees
of
reverence
and
gratitude
probably
however
if
we
who
live
in
the
country
and
think
no
end
of
ourselves
did
invite
such
a
one
and
whether
there
were
hostesses
on
knees
waiting
for
him
or
not
he
would
not
come
how
bored
he
would
be
if
he
did
he
would
find
us
full
of
those
excellences
pater
calls
the
more
obvious
parochial
virtues
jealous
to
madness
of
the
sensitive
and
bloodthirsty
appendage
known
as
our
honour
exact
in
the
observance
of
minor
conventionalities
correct
in
our
apparel
rigid
in
our
views
and
in
our
effect
uninterruptedly
soporific
the
man
who
had
succeeded
in
pushing
his
thoughts
farther
into
the
region
of
the
hitherto
unthought
than
any
of
his
contemporaries
would
not
i
think
if
he
came
once
come
again
but
it
is
supposing
the
impossible
after
all
to
suppose
him
invited
for
all
the
great
ones
of
whom
the
unknown
youth
talked
are
liberals
and
all
the
are
conservatives
and
how
shall
a
german
conservative
be
the
friend
of
a
german
liberal
the
thing
is
unthinkable
like
the
young
man
own
definition
of
the
absolute
it
is
a
negation
of
the
conceivable
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
chestnut
grove
in
front
of
the
inn
i
had
said
so
little
that
my
companion
was
sure
i
was
one
of
the
most
intelligent
women
he
had
ever
met
i
know
he
thought
so
for
he
turned
suddenly
to
me
as
we
were
walking
past
the
frau
förster
and
up
to
the
chestnuts
and
said
is
it
that
german
women
are
so
infinitely
more
intellectual
than
english
women
intellectual
how
nice
and
all
the
result
of
keeping
quiet
in
the
right
places
did
not
know
they
were
i
said
modestly
which
was
true
but
they
are
he
assured
me
with
great
positiveness
and
added
you
have
noticed
that
i
am
english
noticed
that
he
was
english
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
his
collar
i
suspected
it
from
the
moment
he
opened
his
mouth
and
spoke
i
knew
it
and
so
did
everybody
else
under
the
chestnuts
who
heard
him
speaking
as
he
passed
but
why
not
please
this
artless
young
man
so
i
looked
at
him
with
the
raised
eyebrows
of
intense
surprise
and
said
are
you
english
have
been
a
good
deal
in
germany
he
said
looking
happy
it
is
extraordinary
i
said
is
not
so
very
difficult
he
said
looking
more
and
more
happy
really
not
german
the
young
man
belief
in
my
intelligence
was
now
unshakeable
the
frau
förster
who
had
seen
me
disembark
and
set
out
for
my
walk
alone
and
who
saw
me
now
returning
with
a
companion
of
the
other
sex
greeted
me
coldly
her
coldness
i
felt
was
not
unjustifiable
it
is
not
my
practice
to
set
out
by
myself
and
come
back
telling
youths
i
have
never
seen
before
that
their
accomplishments
are
i
began
to
feel
coldly
towards
myself
and
turning
to
the
young
man
said
with
some
abruptness
you
going
in
he
asked
am
not
staying
here
the
launch
does
not
start
for
an
hour
i
go
across
too
then
am
not
crossing
in
the
launch
i
came
over
in
a
really
he
seemed
to
meditate
delightfully
independent
he
added
you
not
observed
that
the
german
fräulein
is
as
independent
as
she
is
intellectual
i
have
not
that
is
just
where
i
think
the
germans
are
so
far
behind
us
their
women
have
nothing
like
the
freedom
ours
have
not
when
they
sail
about
all
alone
in
certainly
is
unusually
enterprising
may
i
see
you
safely
into
it
the
frau
förster
came
towards
us
and
told
him
that
the
food
he
had
ordered
for
eight
was
ready
thank
you
i
said
bother
there
is
a
fisherman
and
a
boy
to
help
me
in
it
is
quite
easy
but
it
is
no
bother
will
not
take
you
away
from
your
supper
you
not
going
to
have
supper
here
lunched
here
so
i
will
not
sup
the
reason
a
good
one
will
see
i
went
away
down
the
path
to
the
beach
the
path
is
steep
and
the
corn
on
either
side
stands
thick
and
high
and
a
few
steps
took
me
out
of
sight
of
the
house
the
chestnuts
and
the
young
man
the
smack
was
lying
some
distance
out
and
the
dinghy
was
tied
to
her
stern
the
fisherman
son
head
was
visible
in
a
peaceful
position
on
a
heap
of
ropes
it
is
difficult
as
well
as
embarrassing
to
shout
as
i
well
knew
but
somebody
would
have
to
and
as
nobody
was
there
but
myself
i
was
plainly
the
one
to
do
it
i
put
my
hands
to
my
mouth
and
not
knowing
the
fisherman
name
called
out
it
sounded
not
only
feeble
but
rude
when
i
remembered
the
appearance
of
the
viking
his
majestic
presence
and
dreamy
dignity
i
was
ashamed
to
find
myself
standing
on
a
rock
and
calling
him
as
loud
as
i
could
the
head
on
the
ropes
did
not
stir
i
waved
my
handkerchief
the
eyes
were
shut
again
i
called
out
and
thought
it
the
most
offensive
of
pronouns
the
boy
was
asleep
and
my
plaintive
cry
went
past
him
over
the
golden
ripples
towards
lauterbach
then
the
englishman
appeared
against
the
sky
up
on
the
ridge
of
the
cornfield
he
saw
my
dilemma
and
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
ran
down
is
in
a
fix
he
observed
in
his
admirably
correct
and
yet
so
painful
german
is
i
said
i
shout
he
shouted
the
boy
started
up
in
alarm
the
fisherman
huge
body
reared
up
from
the
depths
of
the
boat
in
two
minutes
the
dinghy
was
at
the
little
plank
jetty
and
i
was
in
it
was
a
very
good
idea
to
charter
one
of
those
romantic
smacks
to
come
over
in
said
the
young
man
on
the
jetty
wistfully
rather
fishy
i
replied
smiling
as
we
pushed
off
so
very
romantic
you
not
observed
that
the
german
fräulein
is
a
romantic
creature
the
dinghy
began
to
move
beautiful
mixture
of
intelligence
independence
and
romance
you
staying
at
putbus
thanks
for
coming
down
and
shouting
you
know
your
food
will
be
quite
cold
and
uneatable
gathered
from
what
you
said
before
that
it
will
be
uneatable
anyhow
the
dinghy
was
moving
fast
there
was
a
strip
of
golden
water
between
myself
and
the
young
man
on
the
jetty
all
of
it
i
said
raising
my
voice
the
compote
it
is
lovely
compote
it
is
what
you
would
call
in
england
glorified
gooseberry
jam
gooseberry
jam
echoed
the
young
man
apparently
much
struck
by
these
three
english
words
he
added
speaking
louder
for
the
golden
strip
had
grown
very
wide
said
that
without
the
ghost
of
a
foreign
accent
i
the
dinghy
shot
into
the
shadow
of
the
the
viking
and
the
boy
shipped
their
oars
helped
me
in
tied
the
dinghy
to
the
stern
hoisted
the
sail
and
we
dropped
away
into
the
sunset
the
young
man
on
the
distant
jetty
raised
his
cap
he
might
have
been
a
young
archangel
standing
there
the
centre
of
so
much
glory
certainly
a
very
personable
young
man
the
third
day
from
lauterbach
to
göhren
the
official
on
the
steamer
at
the
lauterbach
jetty
had
offered
to
take
me
to
baabe
when
i
said
i
wanted
to
go
to
vilm
and
i
had
naturally
refused
the
offer
afterwards
on
looking
at
the
map
i
found
that
baabe
is
a
place
i
would
have
to
pass
anyhow
if
i
carried
out
my
plan
of
driving
right
round
rügen
the
is
enthusiastic
about
baabe
and
says
after
explaining
its
rather
odd
name
as
meaning
the
lonely
one
that
it
has
a
pine
forest
a
pure
sea
air
with
ozone
in
it
a
climate
both
mild
and
salubrious
and
that
it
works
wonders
on
people
who
have
anything
the
matter
with
their
chests
then
it
says
that
to
lie
at
baabe
embedded
in
soft
dry
sand
allowing
one
glance
to
rove
about
the
broad
sea
with
its
waves
and
the
rest
of
one
to
rejoice
in
the
strong
air
is
an
enviable
thing
to
do
then
it
bursts
into
poetry
that
goes
on
for
a
page
about
the
feelings
of
him
who
is
embedded
written
by
one
who
has
been
it
and
then
comes
the
practical
information
that
you
can
live
at
baabe
for
four
marks
a
day
and
that
dinner
costs
one
mark
twenty
never
was
there
a
more
irrepressibly
poetic
what
tourist
wants
to
be
told
first
how
he
will
feel
when
he
has
embedded
himself
in
sand
pleasures
of
a
subtle
nature
have
no
attraction
for
him
who
has
not
dined
before
everything
the
arriving
tourist
wants
to
know
where
he
will
get
the
best
dinner
and
what
it
will
cost
and
not
until
that
has
been
settled
will
there
be
if
ever
raptures
the
raptures
about
baabe
rang
hollow
the
relief
would
find
there
if
they
could
be
induced
to
go
and
the
poem
of
the
embedded
one
would
not
i
felt
have
been
put
in
if
there
had
been
anything
really
solid
to
praise
still
a
place
in
a
forest
near
the
sea
called
was
to
me
at
least
attractive
and
i
said
to
the
lauterbach
i
knew
and
loved
and
started
full
of
hope
for
the
baabe
i
was
all
ready
to
love
it
was
a
merry
day
of
bright
sun
and
busy
breeze
everything
was
moving
and
glancing
and
fluttering
i
felt
cheerful
to
hilarity
when
we
were
fairly
out
in
the
fields
that
lie
between
the
greek
temple
and
the
village
of
vilmnitz
privately
hilarious
of
course
for
i
could
not
be
openly
so
in
the
sober
presence
of
gertrud
i
have
observed
that
sweet
smells
and
clear
light
and
the
piping
of
birds
all
the
things
that
make
life
lovely
have
no
effect
whatever
on
gertruds
they
apparently
neither
smell
nor
see
nor
hear
them
they
are
not
merely
unable
to
appreciate
them
they
actually
do
not
know
that
they
are
there
this
complete
unconsciousness
of
the
presence
of
beauty
is
always
a
wonder
to
me
no
change
of
weather
changes
my
gertrud
settled
solemnity
she
wears
the
same
face
among
the
roses
of
june
that
she
does
in
the
nipping
winds
of
march
the
heart
of
may
with
which
every
beast
keeps
holiday
never
occupies
her
respectable
interior
she
is
not
more
solemn
on
a
blank
february
afternoon
when
the
world
outside
in
its
cold
wrapping
of
mist
shudders
through
the
sodden
hours
than
she
is
on
such
a
day
of
living
radiance
as
this
third
one
of
our
journey
the
industrious
breeze
lifted
up
the
stray
hairs
from
her
forehead
and
gave
it
little
pats
and
kisses
that
seemed
audaciously
familiar
applied
to
a
brow
of
such
decorum
the
restless
poplar
leaves
whispered
all
the
secrets
of
life
in
her
unhearing
ears
the
cottage
gardens
of
vilmnitz
ablaze
that
day
with
the
white
flame
of
lilies
poured
their
stream
of
scent
into
the
road
and
the
wind
caught
it
up
and
flung
it
across
her
sober
nostrils
and
she
could
not
breathe
without
drawing
in
the
divineness
of
it
yet
her
face
wore
exactly
the
same
expression
that
it
does
when
we
are
passing
pigs
are
the
gertruds
of
this
world
then
unable
to
distinguish
between
pigs
and
lilies
do
they
as
they
toss
on
its
troublesome
waves
smell
perpetual
pigs
the
question
interested
me
for
at
least
three
miles
and
so
much
did
i
want
to
talk
it
over
that
i
nearly
began
talking
it
over
with
gertrud
herself
but
was
restrained
by
the
dread
of
offending
her
for
to
drive
round
rügen
side
by
side
with
an
offended
gertrud
would
be
more
than
my
fortitude
could
endure
vilmnitz
is
a
pretty
little
village
and
the
praises
both
its
inns
but
then
the
praises
every
place
it
mentions
i
would
not
myself
make
use
of
vilmnitz
except
as
a
village
to
be
driven
through
on
the
way
to
somewhere
else
for
this
purpose
it
is
quite
satisfactory
though
its
roads
might
be
less
sandy
for
it
is
a
flowery
place
with
picturesque
cottages
and
high
up
on
a
mound
the
oldest
church
in
the
island
this
church
dates
from
the
twelfth
century
and
i
would
have
liked
to
go
into
it
but
it
was
locked
and
the
parson
had
the
key
and
it
was
the
hour
in
the
afternoon
when
parsons
sleep
and
wisdom
dictates
that
while
they
are
doing
it
they
shall
be
left
alone
so
we
drove
through
vilmnitz
in
all
the
dignity
that
asks
no
favours
and
wants
nothing
from
anybody
the
road
is
ugly
from
there
to
a
place
called
stresow
but
i
do
not
mind
an
ugly
road
if
the
sun
will
only
shine
and
the
ugly
ones
are
useful
for
making
one
see
the
beauty
of
the
pretty
ones
there
are
many
hun
graves
big
mounds
with
trees
growing
on
them
and
i
suppose
huns
inside
them
round
stresow
and
a
monument
reminding
the
of
a
battle
fought
there
between
the
prussians
under
the
old
dessauer
and
the
swedes
we
won
it
was
my
duty
as
a
good
german
to
swell
with
patriotic
pride
on
beholding
this
memorial
and
i
did
so
as
a
nation
the
least
thing
sets
us
swelling
with
this
particular
sort
of
pride
we
acquire
the
habit
in
our
childhood
when
we
imitate
our
parents
and
on
any
fine
sunday
afternoon
you
may
see
whole
families
standing
round
the
victory
column
and
the
statues
in
the
in
berlin
engaged
in
doing
it
the
old
dessauer
is
not
very
sharply
outlined
in
a
mind
that
easily
forgets
and
i
am
afraid
to
say
how
little
i
know
of
him
except
that
he
was
old
and
a
dessauer
yet
i
felt
extremely
proud
of
him
and
proud
of
germany
and
proud
of
myself
as
i
saw
the
place
where
we
fought
under
him
and
won
blood
and
iron
i
cried
and
potent
mixture
do
you
see
that
monument
gertrud
it
marks
the
spot
where
we
prussians
won
a
mighty
battle
led
by
the
old
the
heroic
dessauer
and
though
gertrud
i
am
positive
is
even
more
vague
about
him
than
i
am
at
the
mention
of
a
prussian
victory
her
face
immediately
and
mechanically
took
on
the
familiar
expression
of
him
who
is
secretly
swelling
beyond
stresow
the
road
was
hilly
and
charming
with
woods
drawing
sometimes
to
the
edge
of
it
and
shading
us
and
sometimes
drawing
back
to
the
other
side
of
meadows
and
there
were
the
first
fields
of
yellow
lupins
in
flower
and
i
had
the
delight
to
which
i
look
forward
each
year
as
july
approaches
of
smelling
that
peculiarly
exquisite
scent
and
so
we
came
to
the
region
of
baabe
passing
first
round
the
outskirts
of
sellin
a
place
of
villas
built
in
the
woods
on
the
east
coast
of
rügen
with
the
sea
on
one
side
and
a
big
lake
called
the
selliner
see
on
the
other
and
driving
round
the
north
end
of
this
lake
we
got
on
to
the
dullest
bit
of
road
we
had
yet
had
running
beside
a
railway
line
and
roughly
paved
with
stones
on
our
left
shutting
out
the
sea
and
on
our
right
across
a
marshy
flat
the
lake
and
bare
and
dreary
hills
these
then
were
the
woods
of
baabe
down
the
straight
road
unpleasing
even
in
the
distance
i
could
see
new
houses
standing
aimlessly
about
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
the
sea
waiting
for
the
of
the
lonely
one
will
not
stay
at
baabe
i
called
energetically
to
august
who
had
been
told
we
were
to
stop
there
that
night
on
to
the
next
place
the
next
place
is
göhren
and
the
praise
of
it
is
hysterical
filled
with
distrust
of
the
i
could
only
hope
it
would
be
possible
to
sleep
in
it
for
the
shadows
had
grown
very
long
and
there
is
nowhere
to
stop
at
beyond
göhren
except
thiessow
the
farthest
southern
point
on
the
island
accordingly
we
drove
past
the
two
baabe
hotels
little
wooden
houses
built
on
the
roadside
facing
the
line
with
the
station
immediately
opposite
their
windows
a
train
was
nearly
due
and
intending
passengers
were
sitting
in
front
of
the
hotels
drinking
beer
while
they
waited
and
various
conveyances
had
stopped
there
on
their
way
to
göhren
or
sellin
and
the
lonely
one
seemed
a
very
noisy
busy
one
to
me
as
we
rattled
by
over
the
stones
and
i
was
glad
to
turn
off
to
the
left
at
a
pointing
towards
göhren
and
get
on
to
the
deep
sandy
silent
forest
roads
the
forest
at
first
only
pines
and
rather
scrubby
ones
stretches
the
whole
way
from
baabe
to
göhren
and
grows
more
and
more
beautiful
we
had
to
drive
at
a
because
of
the
deep
sand
but
these
sandy
roads
have
the
advantage
of
being
so
quiet
that
you
can
hear
something
besides
the
noise
of
wheels
and
hoofs
not
till
we
got
to
göhren
did
we
see
the
sea
but
i
heard
it
all
the
way
for
outside
the
forest
the
breeze
had
freshened
into
a
wind
and
though
we
hardly
felt
it
i
could
see
it
passing
over
the
and
hear
how
they
sighed
i
suppose
we
must
have
been
driving
an
hour
among
the
pines
before
we
got
into
a
region
of
mixed
forest
beeches
and
oaks
and
an
undergrowth
of
whortleberries
and
then
tourists
began
to
flutter
among
the
trees
tourists
with
baskets
searching
for
berries
so
that
it
was
certain
göhren
could
not
be
far
off
we
came
quite
suddenly
upon
its
railway
station
a
small
building
alone
in
the
woods
the
terminus
of
the
line
whose
other
end
is
putbus
across
the
line
were
white
dunes
with
young
beeches
bending
in
the
wind
and
beyond
these
dunes
the
sea
roared
beeches
and
dunes
were
in
the
full
glow
of
the
sunset
we
skirting
the
forest
on
the
other
side
were
in
deep
shadow
the
air
was
so
fresh
that
it
was
almost
cold
i
stopped
august
and
got
out
and
crossed
the
deserted
line
and
climbed
up
the
dunes
and
oh
the
glorious
sight
on
the
other
side
the
glorious
dashing
roaring
sea
what
was
pale
lauterbach
compared
to
this
a
mere
lake
a
crystal
pool
a
a
place
in
which
to
lie
by
the
side
of
still
waters
and
dream
over
your
own
and
heaven
reflection
but
here
one
could
not
dream
here
was
life
vigorous
stinging
blustering
life
and
standing
on
the
top
of
the
dune
holding
my
hat
on
with
both
hands
banged
and
battered
by
the
salt
wind
my
clothes
flapping
and
straining
like
a
flag
in
a
gale
on
a
swaying
flagstaff
the
weight
of
a
generation
was
blown
off
my
shoulders
and
i
was
seized
by
a
craving
as
unsuitable
as
it
was
terrific
to
run
and
fetch
a
spade
and
a
bucket
and
dig
and
dig
till
it
was
too
dark
to
dig
any
longer
and
then
go
indoors
tired
and
joyful
and
have
periwinkles
or
shrimps
for
tea
and
behold
gertrud
cold
reminder
of
realities
beside
me
cloak
in
hand
and
she
told
me
it
was
chilly
and
she
put
the
cloak
round
my
unresisting
shoulders
and
it
was
heavy
with
the
weight
of
hours
and
custom
and
the
sun
dropped
at
that
moment
behind
the
forest
and
all
the
radiance
and
colour
went
out
together
you
gertrud
i
said
as
she
wrapped
me
up
but
though
i
shivered
i
was
not
grateful
it
was
certainly
not
the
moment
to
loiter
on
dunes
the
horses
had
done
enough
for
one
day
nearly
half
their
work
having
been
over
heavy
sand
and
we
still
had
to
look
for
our
night
quarters
lauterbach
had
been
empty
therefore
with
the
illuminating
logic
of
women
i
was
sure
göhren
would
have
plenty
of
room
for
us
it
had
not
the
holidays
had
just
begun
and
the
place
swarmed
with
prudent
families
who
had
taken
their
rooms
weeks
before
göhren
is
built
on
a
very
steep
hill
that
drops
straight
down
on
to
the
sands
the
hill
is
so
steep
that
we
got
out
and
august
led
or
rather
pulled
the
horses
up
it
luckily
the
forest
road
we
came
by
runs
along
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
when
we
came
out
of
the
trees
and
found
ourselves
without
the
least
warning
of
stray
houses
or
in
the
heart
of
göhren
we
had
to
climb
up
the
road
and
not
drive
down
it
driving
down
it
must
be
impossible
especially
for
horses
which
like
mine
never
see
a
hill
in
their
own
home
when
we
had
got
safely
to
the
top
we
left
august
and
the
horses
to
get
their
wind
and
set
out
to
engage
rooms
in
the
hotel
the
says
is
the
best
there
is
practically
only
that
one
street
in
göhren
and
it
is
lined
with
hotels
and
and
down
at
the
bottom
between
the
trees
the
leaden
waves
were
dashing
on
the
deserted
sands
people
were
having
supper
whatever
place
we
passed
at
whatever
hour
during
the
entire
tour
people
were
always
having
something
the
hotel
i
had
chosen
was
in
a
garden
and
the
windows
evidently
had
lovely
views
over
the
green
carpet
of
the
level
as
i
walked
up
to
the
door
i
pointed
to
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
i
thought
must
be
the
nicest
and
told
gertrud
it
was
the
one
i
should
take
it
was
a
cold
evening
and
the
were
supping
indoors
there
was
no
or
any
one
else
whom
i
could
ask
for
what
i
wanted
so
we
had
to
go
into
the
restaurant
where
the
whole
strength
of
the
establishment
was
apparently
concentrated
the
room
was
crowded
and
misty
with
the
fumes
of
suppers
all
the
children
of
germany
seemed
to
be
gathered
in
this
one
spot
putting
knives
into
their
artless
mouths
even
when
it
was
only
sauce
they
wanted
to
eat
and
devouring
their
soup
with
a
passionate
enthusiasm
i
explained
my
wishes
grown
suddenly
less
ardent
rather
falteringly
to
the
nearest
waiter
all
the
children
of
germany
lifted
their
heads
out
of
their
to
listen
the
waiter
referred
me
to
the
head
waiter
embarrassed
i
repeated
my
wishes
cooled
down
to
the
point
where
they
almost
cease
to
be
wishes
to
this
person
and
all
the
children
of
germany
sat
with
their
knives
suspended
in
the
air
and
their
mouths
open
while
i
did
it
the
head
waiter
told
me
i
could
have
the
rooms
on
the
of
august
it
was
then
the
of
july
at
which
date
the
holidays
ended
and
the
families
went
home
thank
you
thank
you
that
will
do
beautifully
i
cried
only
too
grateful
that
the
families
had
left
no
corner
unoccupied
into
which
i
might
have
felt
obliged
by
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
force
my
shrinking
limbs
and
hurrying
to
the
door
i
could
hear
how
all
the
children
of
germany
heads
seemed
to
splash
back
again
into
their
but
my
pleasure
at
not
being
doomed
to
stay
there
was
foolish
as
i
quickly
perceived
for
stay
somewhere
i
must
and
the
was
right
when
it
said
this
was
the
best
hotel
outside
in
the
windy
street
august
and
the
horses
were
waiting
patiently
the
stars
were
coming
out
in
the
pale
green
of
the
sky
over
göhren
but
from
the
east
the
night
was
dragging
up
a
great
curtain
of
chill
black
cloud
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
gertrud
and
i
went
from
one
hotel
to
another
from
one
to
another
the
hotels
all
promised
rooms
if
i
would
call
again
in
four
weeks
time
the
only
laughed
at
our
request
for
a
night
shelter
they
said
they
never
took
in
people
who
were
not
going
to
stay
the
entire
season
and
who
did
not
bring
their
own
bedding
their
own
bedding
what
a
complication
of
burdens
to
lay
on
the
back
of
the
patient
father
of
a
family
did
a
with
a
wife
and
say
four
children
have
to
bring
six
sets
of
bedding
with
him
six
sets
of
teutonic
bedding
stuffed
with
feathers
six
pillows
six
of
those
things
to
put
under
pillows
called
and
six
quilted
coverlets
with
insides
of
if
there
was
a
position
to
keep
up
and
of
wadding
if
public
opinion
could
afford
to
be
defied
yet
the
were
full
and
that
there
were
small
children
in
them
was
evident
from
the
frequency
with
which
the
sounds
that
accompany
the
act
of
correction
floated
out
into
the
street
we
found
a
room
at
last
in
the
gloomiest
hotel
in
the
place
only
one
room
under
the
roof
in
a
kind
of
tower
with
eight
beds
in
it
and
no
space
for
anything
else
august
had
no
room
at
all
and
slept
with
his
horses
in
the
stable
there
was
one
small
iron
a
thing
of
tiers
with
a
basin
at
the
top
a
beneath
it
underneath
that
a
and
not
an
inch
more
space
in
which
to
put
a
sponge
or
a
in
the
passage
outside
the
door
was
a
chest
of
drawers
reserved
for
the
use
of
the
occupiers
of
this
room
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
that
we
got
even
this
the
arrival
of
the
family
who
had
taken
it
for
six
weeks
having
been
delayed
for
a
day
or
two
they
were
coming
the
very
next
day
eight
of
them
and
were
all
going
to
spend
six
weeks
in
that
one
room
said
the
landlord
the
presence
of
so
many
beds
it
does
not
explain
the
presence
of
so
many
beds
in
one
room
i
objected
gazing
at
them
resentfully
from
the
only
corner
where
there
were
none
are
content
he
said
shortly
return
every
year
they
are
content
too
with
only
one
of
these
i
inquired
pointing
to
the
extremely
condensed
the
landlord
stared
is
the
sea
he
said
not
without
impatience
at
being
forced
to
state
the
obvious
and
disliking
i
suppose
the
tone
of
my
remarks
he
hurried
downstairs
now
it
is
useless
for
me
to
describe
göhren
for
the
benefit
of
possible
travellers
because
i
am
prejudiced
i
was
cold
there
and
hungry
and
tired
and
i
lived
in
a
garret
to
me
it
will
always
be
a
place
where
there
is
a
penetrating
wind
a
steep
hill
and
an
iron
in
tiers
some
day
when
the
distinct
vision
of
these
things
is
blurred
i
will
order
the
best
rooms
in
the
best
hotel
several
months
beforehand
to
be
kept
for
me
till
i
come
wait
for
fair
windless
weather
and
the
passing
of
the
holidays
and
then
go
once
more
to
göhren
the
place
itself
is
i
believe
beautiful
no
place
with
so
much
sea
and
forest
could
help
being
beautiful
that
evening
the
beauties
were
hidden
and
i
abruptly
left
the
table
beneath
some
shabby
little
chestnuts
in
front
of
the
hotel
where
i
was
trying
in
gloom
and
wind
not
to
notice
the
wetness
of
the
the
stains
on
the
cloth
and
the
mark
on
the
edge
of
the
plates
where
an
unspeakable
waiter
had
put
his
thumb
and
went
out
into
the
street
at
a
baker
i
bought
some
rusks
dry
things
that
show
no
marks
and
continued
down
the
hill
to
the
sea
there
is
no
cold
with
quite
so
forlorn
a
chill
in
it
as
a
sudden
interruption
of
july
heats
and
there
is
no
place
with
quite
so
forlorn
a
feeling
about
it
as
deserted
sands
on
a
leaden
evening
was
it
only
the
evening
before
that
i
had
sailed
away
from
vilm
in
glory
and
in
joy
leaving
the
form
of
the
abstruse
but
beautiful
youth
standing
in
such
a
golden
radiance
that
it
was
as
the
form
of
an
angel
down
among
the
dunes
where
the
grey
ribbons
of
the
were
violently
fluttering
and
indigo
clouds
lay
in
an
unbroken
level
over
leaden
waves
i
sat
and
ate
my
rusks
and
was
wretched
my
soul
rebelled
both
at
the
wretchedness
and
at
the
rusks
not
for
these
had
i
come
to
rügen
i
looked
at
the
waves
and
shuddered
i
looked
at
the
dunes
and
disliked
them
i
was
haunted
by
the
image
of
the
eight
beds
waiting
in
my
garret
for
me
and
of
certain
portions
of
the
wall
from
which
the
paper
was
torn
the
summer
before
probably
by
one
or
more
of
the
eight
struggling
in
the
first
onslaughts
of
asphyxia
and
had
not
been
gummed
on
again
my
thoughts
drifted
miserably
into
solemn
channels
in
the
direction
of
what
carlyle
calls
the
immensities
i
remembered
how
i
was
only
a
speck
after
all
in
uncomfortably
limitless
space
of
no
account
whatever
in
the
general
scheme
of
things
but
with
a
horrid
private
capacity
for
being
often
and
easily
hurt
and
how
specks
have
a
trick
of
dying
which
i
in
my
turn
would
presently
do
and
a
fresh
speck
not
nearly
so
nice
as
i
hoped
and
believed
would
immediately
start
up
and
fill
my
vacancy
perhaps
so
exactly
my
vacancy
that
it
would
even
wear
my
gloves
and
stockings
the
last
rusk
drier
and
drearier
than
any
that
had
gone
before
was
being
eaten
by
the
time
my
thoughts
emerged
from
the
gloom
that
hangs
about
eternal
verities
to
the
desirable
concreteness
of
gloves
and
stockings
what
i
wondered
became
of
the
gloves
and
stockings
of
the
recently
extinguished
female
speck
its
gertrud
would
i
supposed
take
possession
of
its
dresses
but
my
gertrud
for
instance
could
not
wear
my
gloves
and
i
know
believes
only
in
those
stockings
she
has
knitted
herself
still
she
has
nieces
and
i
believe
aunts
she
would
send
them
all
the
things
she
could
not
use
herself
which
would
not
be
nice
of
gertrud
it
would
not
matter
i
supposed
but
it
would
not
be
nice
she
would
be
letting
herself
down
to
being
a
kind
of
ghoul
i
started
up
with
the
feeling
that
i
must
go
and
remonstrate
with
her
before
it
was
too
late
and
there
struggling
in
the
wind
and
deep
sand
towards
me
her
arms
full
of
warm
things
and
her
face
of
anxious
solicitude
was
the
good
gertrud
herself
have
prepared
the
gracious
one
bed
she
called
out
breathlessly
she
not
soon
enter
it
gertrud
i
cried
remembering
the
garret
and
forgetting
the
ghoul
bed
the
aid
of
the
chambermaid
i
have
removed
two
of
them
into
the
passage
said
gertrud
buttoning
me
into
my
coat
the
she
shook
her
head
i
could
not
remove
for
there
is
no
other
to
be
had
in
its
place
the
chambermaid
said
that
in
four
weeks
she
stopped
and
scanned
my
face
gracious
one
looks
put
out
she
said
anything
happened
out
my
dear
gertrud
i
have
been
thinking
of
very
serious
things
you
can
not
expect
me
to
frolic
along
paths
of
thought
that
lead
to
mighty
and
unpleasant
truths
why
should
i
always
smile
i
am
not
a
cheshire
cat
trust
the
gracious
one
will
come
in
now
and
enter
her
bed
said
gertrud
decidedly
who
had
never
heard
of
cheshire
cats
and
was
sure
that
the
mention
of
them
indicated
a
brain
in
need
of
repose
gertrud
i
cried
intolerably
stirred
by
the
bare
mention
of
that
bed
is
a
bleak
and
mischievous
world
is
it
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
be
warm
and
comfortable
and
happy
again
the
fourth
day
from
göhren
to
thiessow
we
left
göhren
at
seven
the
next
morning
and
breakfasted
outside
it
where
the
end
and
the
woods
begin
gertrud
had
bought
bread
and
butter
and
a
bottle
of
milk
and
we
sat
among
the
nightshades
whose
flowers
were
everywhere
and
ate
in
purity
and
cleanliness
while
august
waited
in
the
road
the
charming
little
flowers
with
their
purple
and
other
half
yellow
are
those
that
have
red
berries
later
in
the
year
and
are
called
by
keats
ruby
grapes
of
proserpine
yet
they
are
not
poisonous
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
suffer
your
pale
forehead
to
be
kissed
by
them
if
you
want
to
they
are
as
innocent
as
they
are
pretty
and
the
wood
was
full
of
them
poison
death
and
proserpine
seemed
far
enough
away
from
that
leafy
place
and
the
rude
honesty
of
bread
and
butter
still
lest
i
should
feel
too
happy
and
therefore
be
less
able
to
bear
any
shocks
that
might
be
awaiting
me
at
thiessow
i
repeated
the
melancholy
and
beautiful
ode
for
my
admonishment
under
my
breath
it
had
no
effect
usually
it
is
an
unfailing
antidote
in
its
extraordinary
depression
to
any
excess
of
cheerfulness
but
the
wood
and
the
morning
sun
and
the
bread
and
butter
were
more
than
a
match
for
it
no
incantation
of
verse
could
make
me
believe
that
joy
hand
was
for
ever
at
his
lips
bidding
adieu
joy
seemed
to
be
sitting
contentedly
beside
me
sharing
my
bread
and
butter
and
when
i
drove
away
towards
thiessow
he
got
into
the
carriage
with
me
and
whispered
that
i
was
going
to
be
very
happy
there
outside
the
wood
the
sandy
road
lay
between
cornfields
gay
with
corncockles
bright
reminders
that
the
coming
harvest
will
be
poor
from
here
to
thiessow
there
are
no
trees
except
round
the
cottages
of
philippshagen
a
pretty
village
with
a
hoary
church
beyond
which
the
road
became
pure
sand
dribbling
off
into
mere
uncertain
tracks
over
the
flat
pasture
land
that
stretches
all
the
way
to
thiessow
the
warmly
recommends
the
seashore
when
the
wind
is
in
the
east
which
it
was
as
the
quickest
and
firmest
route
from
göhren
to
thiessow
but
i
chose
rather
to
take
the
road
over
the
plain
because
there
was
a
poem
in
the
about
the
way
along
the
shore
and
the
said
it
described
it
extremely
well
and
i
was
sure
that
if
that
were
so
i
would
do
better
to
go
the
other
way
this
is
the
poem
the
translation
is
exact
the
original
being
unrhymed
and
the
punctuation
is
the
poet
splashing
waves
rocking
boat
dipping
gulls
dunes
raging
winds
floating
froth
flashing
lightning
moon
fearful
hearts
morning
grey
stormy
nights
faith
i
read
it
marvelled
and
went
the
other
way
thiessow
is
a
place
that
has
to
be
gone
to
for
its
sake
alone
as
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
journey
the
entire
length
of
the
plain
that
separates
it
from
everywhere
else
you
must
also
make
up
your
mind
to
journey
the
entire
length
back
again
to
see
göhren
once
more
to
pass
through
baabe
and
to
make
a
closer
acquaintance
with
sellin
which
is
on
the
way
to
the
yet
unvisited
villages
going
north
it
is
a
singular
drive
down
to
thiessow
singular
because
it
seems
as
though
it
would
never
leave
off
you
see
the
place
far
away
in
the
distance
the
whole
time
and
you
jolt
on
and
on
at
a
walking
pace
towards
it
in
and
out
of
ruts
over
the
sun
beating
on
your
head
sea
on
your
left
rolling
up
the
beach
in
long
waves
more
sea
on
your
right
across
the
undulating
greenness
a
distant
hill
with
a
village
by
the
water
to
the
west
sails
of
people
in
a
curious
costume
mowing
in
a
meadow
a
great
way
off
and
tethered
all
over
the
plain
solitary
sheep
and
cows
whose
nervousness
at
your
approach
is
the
nervousness
begotten
of
a
retired
life
there
are
no
trees
and
if
we
had
not
seen
thiessow
all
the
time
we
should
have
lost
our
way
for
there
is
no
road
as
it
is
you
go
on
till
you
are
stopped
by
the
land
coming
to
an
end
and
there
you
are
at
thiessow
i
believe
in
the
summer
you
can
get
there
by
steamer
from
göhren
or
baabe
but
if
it
is
windy
and
the
waves
are
too
big
for
the
boats
that
land
you
to
put
off
the
steamer
does
not
stop
so
that
the
only
way
is
over
the
plain
or
along
the
shore
i
walked
nearly
all
the
time
the
jolting
was
so
intolerable
it
was
heavy
work
for
the
horses
and
straining
work
for
the
carriage
gertrud
sat
gripping
the
bandbox
for
with
every
lurch
it
tried
to
roll
out
august
looked
unhappy
his
experiences
at
göhren
had
been
worse
than
ours
and
thiessow
was
right
down
at
the
end
of
all
things
and
had
the
drawback
obvious
even
to
august
that
whatever
it
was
like
we
would
have
to
endure
it
for
swelter
back
again
over
the
broiling
plain
only
to
stay
a
second
night
at
göhren
was
as
much
out
of
the
question
for
the
horses
as
for
ourselves
as
for
me
i
was
absolutely
happy
the
wide
plain
the
wide
sea
the
wide
sky
were
so
gloriously
full
of
light
and
life
the
very
turf
beneath
my
feet
had
an
eager
spring
in
it
the
very
daisies
covering
it
looked
sprightlier
than
anywhere
else
and
up
among
the
great
piled
clouds
the
blessed
little
larks
were
fairly
drunk
with
delight
i
walked
some
way
ahead
of
the
carriage
so
as
to
feel
alone
i
could
have
walked
for
ever
in
that
radiance
and
freshness
the
sheep
ran
wildly
round
and
round
as
i
passed
tugging
at
their
chains
in
frantic
agitation
even
the
cows
seemed
uneasy
if
i
came
too
close
and
in
the
meadow
the
mowers
stopped
mowing
to
watch
us
dwindle
into
dots
in
this
part
of
rügen
the
natives
wear
a
peculiarly
hideous
dress
or
rather
the
men
do
the
women
costume
is
not
so
ugly
and
looking
through
my
glasses
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
that
the
male
mowers
had
on
long
baggy
white
things
that
were
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
woman
white
petticoat
on
either
leg
but
the
mowers
and
their
trousers
were
soon
left
far
behind
the
sun
had
climbed
very
high
was
pouring
down
almost
straight
on
to
our
heads
and
still
thiessow
seemed
no
nearer
well
it
did
not
matter
that
is
the
chief
beauty
of
a
tour
like
mine
that
nothing
matters
as
soon
as
there
are
no
trains
to
catch
a
journey
becomes
magnificently
simple
we
might
loiter
as
long
as
we
liked
on
the
road
if
only
we
got
to
some
place
any
place
by
nightfall
this
of
course
was
my
buoyant
midday
mood
before
fatigue
had
weighed
down
my
limbs
and
hunger
gnawed
holes
in
my
cheerfulness
the
wind
smelling
of
sea
and
grass
had
quite
blown
away
the
memory
of
how
tragic
life
had
looked
the
night
before
when
set
about
by
too
many
beds
and
not
enough
and
i
walked
along
with
what
felt
like
all
the
brightness
of
heaven
in
my
heart
the
end
of
this
walk
i
think
of
it
as
one
of
the
happiest
and
most
beautiful
i
have
had
came
about
one
at
that
dull
hour
when
the
glory
of
morning
is
gone
and
the
serenity
of
afternoon
has
not
begun
we
arrived
at
a
small
grey
wooden
hotel
separated
from
the
east
sea
by
a
belt
of
facing
a
common
to
the
south
and
about
twenty
minutes
walk
from
thiessow
proper
which
lies
on
the
sea
on
the
western
and
southern
shore
of
the
point
it
looked
clean
and
i
went
in
august
and
gertrud
sat
broiling
in
the
sun
of
the
shelterless
sandy
road
in
front
of
the
garden
somehow
i
had
no
doubts
about
being
taken
in
here
and
i
was
at
once
shown
a
spotless
little
bedroom
by
a
spotless
landlady
it
was
a
corner
room
in
the
corner
of
the
house
and
one
window
looked
south
on
to
the
common
and
the
other
west
on
to
the
plain
the
bed
was
drawn
across
this
window
and
lying
on
it
i
could
see
the
western
sea
the
distant
hill
on
the
shore
with
its
village
and
grass
grass
nothing
but
grass
rolling
away
from
the
very
wall
of
the
house
to
infinity
and
the
sunset
the
room
was
tiny
if
i
had
had
more
than
a
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
get
into
it
it
had
a
locked
door
leading
into
another
bedroom
which
was
occupied
said
the
chambermaid
by
a
quiet
lady
who
would
make
no
noise
room
was
opposite
mine
august
cheered
up
when
i
went
out
and
told
him
he
could
go
to
the
stables
and
put
up
and
gertrud
was
visibly
agreeably
surprised
by
the
cleanliness
of
both
our
rooms
i
lunched
on
a
verandah
overlooking
the
common
with
the
madonna
lilies
of
the
little
garden
within
reach
of
my
hand
and
the
tablecloth
and
the
spoons
and
the
waiter
were
all
in
keeping
with
the
clean
landlady
the
inn
being
small
the
visitors
were
few
and
those
i
saw
dining
at
the
other
little
tables
on
the
verandah
appeared
to
be
quiet
inoffensive
people
such
as
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
quiet
place
the
sea
was
not
visible
but
i
could
hear
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
belt
of
firs
and
the
verandah
facing
south
and
being
hot
and
airless
a
longing
to
get
into
the
cool
water
took
hold
of
me
the
waiter
said
the
were
open
in
the
afternoon
from
four
to
five
and
i
went
upstairs
to
tell
gertrud
to
bring
my
things
down
to
the
beach
at
four
when
she
would
find
me
lying
in
the
sand
while
i
was
talking
the
quiet
lady
in
the
next
room
began
to
talk
too
apparently
to
the
chambermaid
for
she
talked
of
hot
water
i
broke
off
my
own
talk
short
it
was
not
that
the
partition
was
so
thin
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
in
the
same
room
as
myself
though
that
was
sufficiently
disturbing
it
was
that
i
thought
for
a
moment
i
knew
the
voice
i
looked
at
gertrud
gertrud
face
was
empty
of
all
expression
the
quiet
lady
continuing
told
the
chambermaid
to
let
down
the
and
the
note
in
her
voice
that
had
struck
me
was
no
longer
there
feeling
relieved
for
i
did
not
want
to
come
across
acquaintances
i
put
in
my
pocket
and
went
out
the
was
stuffy
and
suggested
mosquitoes
but
several
had
slung
up
hammocks
and
were
lying
in
them
dozing
so
that
there
could
not
have
been
mosquitoes
and
coming
suddenly
out
on
to
the
sands
all
idea
of
stuffiness
vanished
for
there
was
the
same
glorious
heaving
sparkling
splashing
blue
that
i
had
seen
from
the
dunes
of
göhren
the
evening
before
at
sunset
the
a
modest
place
with
only
two
cells
and
a
long
plank
bridge
running
into
deep
water
was
just
opposite
the
end
of
the
path
through
the
firs
it
was
locked
up
and
deserted
the
sands
were
deserted
too
for
the
tourists
were
all
dozing
in
hammocks
or
in
beds
i
made
a
hollow
in
the
clean
dry
sand
beneath
the
last
of
the
fir
trees
and
settled
down
to
enjoy
myself
till
gertrud
came
oh
i
was
happy
thiessow
was
so
quiet
and
primitive
the
afternoon
so
radiant
the
colours
of
the
sea
and
of
the
long
line
of
silver
sand
and
of
the
soft
green
gloom
of
the
background
of
firs
so
beautiful
commendably
far
away
to
the
north
i
saw
the
coastguard
hill
belonging
to
göhren
on
my
right
the
woods
turned
into
beechwoods
and
scrambled
up
high
cliffs
that
seemed
to
form
the
end
of
the
peninsula
i
would
go
and
look
at
all
that
later
on
after
my
bathe
if
there
is
a
thing
i
love
it
is
exploring
the
little
paths
of
an
unknown
wood
finding
out
the
corners
where
it
keeps
its
periwinkles
and
anemones
discovering
its
birds
nests
waiting
motionless
for
its
hedgehogs
and
squirrels
and
even
searching
out
those
luscious
recesses
oozy
and
green
where
it
keeps
its
happy
slugs
they
tell
me
slugs
are
not
really
happy
that
nature
is
cruel
and
that
you
only
have
to
scratch
the
pleasant
surface
of
things
to
get
at
once
to
brutalities
perhaps
if
you
were
to
go
on
scratching
you
might
get
to
consolations
and
beneficiencies
again
but
why
scratch
at
all
why
not
take
the
beauty
and
be
grateful
i
will
not
scratch
i
will
not
criticise
my
own
mother
who
has
sheltered
me
so
long
in
her
broad
bosom
and
been
so
long
my
surest
guide
to
all
that
is
gentle
and
lovely
whatever
she
does
from
thunderbolts
to
headaches
i
will
not
criticise
for
if
she
gives
me
a
headache
is
there
not
pleasure
when
it
leaves
off
and
if
she
hurls
a
thunderbolt
at
me
and
i
am
unexpectedly
exterminated
my
body
shall
serve
as
a
basis
for
fresh
life
and
growth
and
shall
blossom
out
presently
into
an
immortality
of
daisies
i
think
i
must
have
slept
for
the
sound
of
the
waves
grew
very
far
away
and
i
only
seemed
to
have
been
watching
the
sun
on
them
for
a
few
minutes
when
gertrud
voice
floated
across
space
to
my
ears
and
she
was
saying
it
was
past
four
and
that
one
lady
had
already
gone
down
to
bathe
and
that
as
there
were
only
two
cells
if
i
did
not
go
soon
i
might
not
get
a
bathe
at
all
i
sat
up
in
my
hollow
and
looked
across
to
the
huts
the
bathing
woman
in
the
usual
white
calico
sunbonnet
was
there
waiting
on
the
plank
bridge
no
one
was
in
the
sea
yet
it
was
a
great
bore
that
there
should
be
any
one
else
bathing
just
then
for
german
female
tourists
are
apt
to
be
extraordinarily
cordial
in
the
water
on
land
laced
into
suppressive
whalebone
dressed
and
with
their
hair
dry
and
curled
they
can
not
but
keep
within
the
limits
set
by
convention
but
the
more
clothes
they
take
off
the
more
do
they
seem
to
consider
the
last
barrier
between
human
creature
and
human
creature
broken
down
and
they
will
behave
towards
you
meeting
you
on
this
common
ground
of
wateriness
as
though
they
had
known
you
and
extravagantly
esteemed
you
for
years
their
cordiality
too
becomes
more
pronounced
in
proportion
to
the
coldness
and
roughness
of
the
water
and
the
water
that
day
looked
cold
and
was
certainly
rough
and
i
felt
that
there
being
only
two
of
us
in
it
it
would
be
impossible
to
escape
the
advances
of
the
other
one
still
as
the
cells
were
shut
at
five
i
could
not
wait
till
she
had
done
so
i
went
down
and
began
to
undress
while
i
was
doing
it
i
heard
her
leave
her
cell
and
anxiously
ask
the
woman
if
the
sea
were
very
cold
then
she
apparently
put
in
one
foot
for
i
heard
her
shriek
then
she
apparently
bent
down
and
scooping
up
water
in
her
hand
splashed
her
face
with
it
for
i
heard
her
gasp
then
she
tried
the
other
foot
and
shrieked
again
and
then
the
bathing
woman
fearful
lest
five
should
still
find
her
on
duty
began
mellifluously
to
persuade
by
this
time
i
was
ready
but
i
did
not
choose
to
meet
the
unknown
emotional
one
on
the
plank
bridge
because
the
garments
in
which
one
bathes
in
german
waters
are
regrettably
scanty
so
i
waited
peeping
through
the
little
window
after
much
talk
the
eloquence
of
the
bathing
woman
had
its
effect
and
the
bather
with
one
wild
scream
leapt
into
the
foam
which
immediately
engulfed
her
and
when
she
emerged
the
first
thing
she
did
on
getting
her
breath
was
to
clutch
hold
of
the
rope
and
shriek
without
stopping
for
at
least
a
minute
benehmen
i
observed
to
gertrud
with
a
shrug
must
be
very
cold
i
added
to
myself
not
without
a
secret
shrinking
but
to
my
surprise
when
i
ran
along
the
planks
above
where
the
unfortunate
clutched
and
shrieked
she
looked
up
at
me
with
a
wet
but
beaming
countenance
and
interrupted
her
shrieks
to
gasp
out
these
in
the
water
i
thought
indignantly
what
right
had
this
one
only
because
my
apparel
was
scanty
to
smile
at
me
and
say
i
was
so
much
startled
by
the
unexpected
exclamation
from
a
person
who
had
the
minute
before
been
rending
the
air
with
her
laments
that
my
foot
slipped
on
the
wet
planks
i
just
heard
the
bathing
woman
advising
me
to
take
care
just
had
time
to
comment
to
myself
on
the
foolishness
of
such
advice
to
one
already
hurling
through
space
and
then
came
a
shock
of
coldness
and
wetness
and
suffocation
and
the
next
moment
there
i
was
gasping
and
spluttering
exactly
as
the
other
had
gasped
and
spluttered
but
with
this
difference
that
she
had
clutched
the
rope
and
shrieked
and
i
with
all
the
convulsive
energy
of
panic
was
shrieking
and
clutching
the
nicht
i
heard
her
say
with
an
odious
jollity
through
the
singing
in
my
ears
every
wave
lifted
me
a
little
off
my
feet
my
mouth
was
full
of
water
my
eyes
were
blinded
with
spray
i
continued
to
cling
to
her
with
one
hand
miserably
conscious
that
after
this
there
would
be
no
shaking
her
off
and
rubbing
my
eyes
with
the
other
looked
at
her
my
shrieks
froze
on
my
lips
where
had
i
seen
her
face
before
surely
i
knew
it
she
wore
one
of
those
grey
caps
drawn
tightly
down
to
her
eyes
that
keep
the
water
out
so
well
and
are
so
hopelessly
hideous
she
smiled
back
at
me
with
the
utmost
friendliness
and
asked
me
again
whether
i
did
not
think
it
glorious
i
panted
letting
her
go
and
groping
blindly
for
the
rope
you
thank
you
pray
pardon
me
for
having
seized
you
so
rudely
she
cried
beginning
to
jump
up
and
down
again
in
the
world
is
she
i
asked
myself
getting
away
as
fast
as
i
could
have
i
seen
her
before
probably
she
was
an
undesirable
acquaintance
perhaps
she
was
my
dressmaker
i
had
not
paid
her
last
absurd
bill
and
that
and
a
certain
faint
resemblance
to
what
my
dressmaker
would
look
like
in
an
cap
was
what
put
her
into
my
head
and
no
sooner
had
i
thought
it
than
i
was
sure
of
it
and
the
conviction
was
one
of
quite
unprecedented
disagreeableness
how
profoundly
unpleasant
to
meet
this
person
in
the
water
to
have
come
all
the
way
to
rügen
to
have
suffered
at
göhren
to
have
walked
miles
in
the
heat
of
the
day
to
thiessow
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bathing
with
my
dressmaker
and
to
have
tumbled
in
on
top
of
her
and
clung
about
her
neck
i
climbed
out
and
ran
into
my
cell
my
idea
was
to
get
dressed
and
away
as
speedily
as
possible
yet
with
all
gertrud
haste
just
as
i
came
out
of
my
cell
the
other
woman
came
out
of
hers
in
her
clothes
and
we
met
face
to
face
with
one
accord
we
stopped
dead
and
our
mouths
fell
open
she
cried
is
i
cried
is
it
was
my
cousin
charlotte
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
ten
years
the
fourth
day
at
thiessow
my
cousin
charlotte
was
twenty
when
i
saw
her
last
now
she
was
thirty
besides
having
had
an
cap
on
both
these
things
make
a
difference
to
a
woman
though
she
did
not
seem
aware
of
it
and
was
lost
in
amazement
that
i
should
not
have
recognised
her
at
once
i
told
her
it
was
because
of
the
cap
then
i
expressed
the
astonishment
i
felt
that
she
had
not
at
once
recognised
me
and
after
hesitating
a
moment
she
said
that
i
had
been
making
too
many
faces
and
so
with
infinite
delicacy
did
we
avoid
all
allusion
to
those
ten
unhideable
years
charlotte
had
had
a
chequered
career
at
least
beside
my
placid
life
it
seemed
to
have
bristled
with
events
in
her
early
youth
and
to
the
dismay
of
her
parents
she
insisted
on
being
educated
at
one
of
the
english
colleges
for
women
it
was
at
oxford
but
i
forget
its
name
a
most
unusual
course
for
a
young
german
girl
of
her
class
to
take
she
was
so
determined
and
made
her
relations
so
uncomfortable
during
their
period
of
opposition
that
they
gave
in
with
what
appeared
to
more
distant
relatives
who
were
not
with
charlotte
all
day
long
a
criminal
weakness
at
oxford
she
took
everything
there
was
to
take
in
the
way
of
honours
and
prizes
and
was
the
joy
and
pride
of
her
college
in
her
last
year
a
german
savant
of
sixty
an
exceedingly
bright
light
in
the
firmament
of
european
learning
came
to
oxford
and
was
fêted
when
charlotte
saw
the
great
local
beings
she
was
accustomed
to
look
upon
as
the
most
marvellous
men
of
the
age
the
heads
of
colleges
professors
and
other
celebrities
vying
with
each
other
in
honouring
her
countryman
her
admiration
for
him
was
such
that
it
took
her
breath
away
at
some
function
she
was
brought
to
his
notice
and
her
family
being
well
known
in
germany
and
she
herself
then
in
the
freshness
of
besides
being
very
pretty
the
great
man
was
much
interested
and
beamed
benevolently
upon
her
and
chucked
her
under
the
chin
the
head
in
whose
house
he
was
staying
a
person
equally
exquisite
in
appearance
and
manners
who
had
had
much
to
forgive
that
was
less
excellent
in
his
guest
and
had
done
so
freely
for
the
sake
of
the
known
profundity
of
his
knowledge
could
not
but
remark
this
interest
in
charlotte
and
told
him
pleasantly
of
her
promising
career
the
professor
appeared
to
listen
with
attention
and
looked
pleased
and
approving
but
when
the
head
ceased
instead
of
commenting
on
her
talents
or
the
creditable
manner
in
which
she
had
developed
them
what
he
said
was
nice
round
little
girl
a
very
nice
round
little
girl
and
this
he
repeated
emphatically
several
times
to
the
distinct
discomfort
of
the
head
while
his
eyes
followed
her
benignly
into
the
distant
corner
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
obscure
six
months
later
she
married
the
professor
her
family
wept
and
implored
in
vain
told
her
in
vain
of
the
terrificness
of
marrying
a
widower
with
seven
children
all
older
than
herself
charlotte
was
blinded
by
the
glory
of
having
been
chosen
by
the
greatest
man
oxford
had
ever
seen
oxford
was
everything
to
her
her
distant
german
home
and
its
spiritless
inhabitants
were
objects
only
of
her
shrugs
she
wrote
to
me
saying
she
was
going
to
be
the
life
companion
of
the
finest
thinker
of
the
age
her
people
so
illiterate
and
so
full
of
prejudices
could
not
she
supposed
be
expected
to
appreciate
the
splendour
of
her
prospects
she
thanked
heaven
that
her
own
education
had
saved
her
from
such
a
laughable
blindness
she
could
conceive
nothing
more
glorious
than
marrying
the
man
in
all
the
world
whom
you
most
reverently
admire
than
being
chosen
as
the
sharer
of
his
thoughts
and
the
partner
of
his
intellectual
joys
after
that
i
seldom
heard
from
her
she
lived
in
the
south
of
germany
and
her
professor
fame
waxed
vaster
every
year
every
year
too
she
brought
a
potential
professor
into
a
world
already
so
full
of
them
and
every
year
death
cut
short
its
career
after
a
period
varying
from
ten
days
to
a
fortnight
and
the
seemed
perpetually
to
be
announcing
that
früh
ist
meine
liebe
frau
charlotte
von
einem
strammen
jungen
leicht
und
glücklich
entbunden
and
starb
unser
sohn
bernhard
im
zarten
alter
von
zwei
none
of
the
children
lived
long
enough
to
meet
the
next
brother
and
they
were
steadily
christened
bernhard
after
a
father
apparently
thirsting
to
perpetuate
his
name
it
became
at
last
quite
uncomfortable
charlotte
seemed
never
to
be
out
of
the
for
six
years
she
and
the
poor
little
bernhards
went
on
in
this
manner
haunting
its
birth
and
death
columns
and
then
abruptly
disappeared
from
them
and
the
next
i
heard
of
her
was
that
she
was
in
england
in
london
oxford
and
other
intellectual
centres
lecturing
in
the
cause
of
woman
the
began
about
her
again
but
on
another
page
the
was
shocked
for
charlotte
was
emancipated
charlotte
family
was
so
much
shocked
that
it
was
hysterical
charlotte
not
content
with
lecturing
wrote
pamphlets
lofty
documents
of
a
deadly
earnestness
in
german
and
english
and
they
might
be
seen
any
day
in
the
bookshop
windows
den
charlotte
family
nearly
fainted
when
it
had
to
walk
den
the
radical
papers
which
were
only
read
by
charlotte
family
when
nobody
was
looking
and
were
never
allowed
openly
to
darken
their
doors
took
her
under
their
wing
and
wrote
articles
in
her
praise
it
was
they
said
surprising
and
refreshing
to
find
views
and
intelligence
of
the
sort
emerging
from
the
suffocating
ancestral
atmosphere
that
hangs
about
the
the
paralysing
effect
of
too
many
ancestors
was
not
as
a
rule
to
be
lightly
shaken
off
especially
by
the
female
descendants
when
it
did
get
shaken
off
as
in
this
instance
it
should
be
the
subject
of
rejoicing
to
every
person
who
had
the
advancement
of
civilisation
at
heart
the
civilisation
of
a
state
could
never
be
great
so
long
as
its
women
etc
etc
my
uncle
and
aunt
nearly
died
of
this
praise
her
brothers
and
sisters
stayed
in
the
country
and
refused
invitations
only
the
professor
seemed
as
pleased
as
ever
is
my
cousin
i
said
to
him
at
a
party
in
berlin
where
he
was
being
lionised
proud
you
must
be
of
such
a
clever
wife
i
had
not
met
him
before
and
a
more
pleasant
rosy
nice
little
old
man
i
have
never
seen
he
beamed
at
me
through
his
spectacles
almost
could
i
see
the
narrow
line
that
separated
me
from
a
yes
he
said
they
all
tell
me
the
little
lotte
is
making
a
noise
empty
vessels
do
but
i
daresay
what
she
tells
them
is
a
very
pretty
little
nonsense
one
must
not
be
too
critical
in
these
cases
and
seizing
upon
the
cousinship
he
began
to
call
me
i
inquired
how
it
was
she
was
wandering
about
the
world
alone
he
said
he
could
not
imagine
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
pamphlets
he
said
he
had
no
time
for
light
reading
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
remark
no
doubt
with
enthusiasm
that
i
had
read
some
of
his
simpler
works
to
my
great
benefit
and
unbounded
admiration
he
looked
more
benign
than
ever
and
said
he
had
had
no
idea
that
anything
of
his
was
taught
in
elementary
schools
in
a
word
i
was
routed
by
the
professor
i
withdrew
feeling
crushed
and
wondering
if
i
had
deserved
it
he
came
after
me
called
me
his
kleine
and
sitting
down
beside
me
patted
my
hand
and
inquired
with
solicitude
how
it
was
he
had
never
seen
me
before
renewed
attempts
on
my
part
to
feed
like
a
bee
on
the
honey
of
his
learning
were
met
only
by
pats
he
would
pat
but
he
would
not
impart
wisdom
and
the
longer
he
patted
the
more
perfect
did
his
serenity
seem
to
become
when
people
approached
us
and
showed
a
tendency
to
hang
on
the
great
lips
he
looked
up
with
a
happy
smile
and
said
is
my
little
cousin
we
have
much
to
say
to
each
other
and
turned
his
back
on
them
and
when
i
was
asked
whether
i
had
not
spent
a
memorable
an
elevating
evening
being
talked
to
so
much
by
the
famous
nieberlein
i
could
only
put
on
a
solemn
face
and
say
that
i
should
not
soon
forget
it
will
be
something
to
tell
your
children
of
in
the
days
to
come
when
he
is
a
splendid
memory
said
the
enthusiast
wo
it
i
ejaculated
with
the
eyes
of
rapture
me
one
thing
i
said
to
charlotte
as
we
walked
slowly
along
the
sands
towards
the
cliff
and
the
beechwood
since
you
took
me
for
a
stranger
were
you
so
well
so
gracious
to
me
in
the
water
gertrud
had
gone
back
to
the
hotel
laden
with
both
our
may
as
well
take
mine
up
at
the
same
time
charlotte
had
remarked
piling
them
on
gertrud
passive
arms
undeniably
she
might
and
accordingly
she
did
but
her
face
was
wry
and
so
had
been
the
smile
with
which
she
returned
charlotte
careless
greetings
still
keep
that
old
fool
i
see
said
charlotte
would
send
me
mad
to
have
a
person
of
inferior
intellect
for
ever
fussing
round
me
would
send
me
much
madder
to
have
a
person
of
superior
intellect
buttoning
my
boots
and
scorning
me
while
she
does
it
i
replied
was
i
so
gracious
to
you
in
the
water
repeated
charlotte
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
made
not
without
anxiousness
for
one
likes
to
know
one
own
cousin
above
the
practices
of
ordinary
tell
you
why
i
detest
the
stiff
icy
way
women
have
of
turning
their
backs
if
they
do
know
each
other
they
not
very
stiff
i
remarked
thinking
of
past
bathing
experiences
besides
in
the
water
is
not
only
unkind
it
is
simply
wicked
for
how
shall
we
ever
be
anything
but
tools
and
drudges
if
we
do
if
we
do
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
oh
my
heart
goes
out
to
all
women
i
never
see
one
without
feeling
i
must
do
all
in
my
power
to
get
to
know
her
to
help
her
to
show
her
what
she
must
do
so
that
when
her
youth
is
gone
there
will
still
be
something
left
a
so
much
nobler
happiness
a
so
much
truer
joy
what
i
asked
puzzled
charlotte
was
looking
into
my
eyes
as
though
she
were
reading
my
soul
she
was
whatever
she
might
have
thought
she
was
doing
what
she
had
before
of
course
she
said
with
some
asperity
perhaps
what
she
had
before
was
just
what
she
liked
best
if
it
was
only
the
sort
of
joy
every
woman
who
is
young
and
pretty
gets
heaped
on
her
does
it
not
take
wings
and
fly
away
the
moment
she
happens
to
look
haggard
or
is
or
ill
it
was
as
i
had
feared
charlotte
was
strenuous
there
was
not
a
doubt
of
it
and
the
strenuous
woman
is
a
form
of
the
sex
out
of
whose
way
i
have
hitherto
kept
of
course
i
knew
from
the
pamphlets
and
the
lectures
that
she
was
not
one
to
stay
at
home
and
see
the
point
of
purring
over
her
husband
socks
but
i
had
supposed
one
might
lecture
and
write
things
without
bringing
the
pamphlet
manner
to
bear
on
one
own
blood
relations
were
very
jolly
in
the
water
i
said
are
you
suddenly
so
serious
water
replied
charlotte
the
only
place
i
am
ever
what
you
call
jolly
in
it
is
the
only
place
where
i
can
ever
forget
how
terribly
earnest
life
is
dear
charlotte
shall
we
sit
down
the
bathing
has
made
me
tired
we
did
sit
down
and
leaning
my
back
against
a
rock
and
pulling
my
hat
over
my
eyes
i
gazed
out
at
the
sunlit
sea
and
at
the
flocks
of
little
white
clouds
hanging
over
it
to
the
point
where
they
met
the
water
while
charlotte
talked
yes
she
was
right
nearly
always
right
in
everything
she
said
and
it
was
certainly
meritorious
to
use
strength
and
health
and
talents
as
she
was
doing
trying
to
get
rid
of
mouldy
prejudices
i
gathered
that
what
she
was
fighting
for
were
equal
rights
and
equal
privileges
for
women
and
men
alike
it
is
a
story
i
have
heard
before
and
up
to
now
it
has
not
had
a
satisfactory
ending
and
charlotte
was
so
small
and
the
world
she
defied
was
so
big
and
so
indifferent
and
had
such
an
inconsequent
habit
of
associating
all
such
efforts
in
themselves
nothing
less
than
heroic
with
the
ridiculousness
of
cropped
hair
and
extremities
clothed
in
bloomers
i
protest
that
the
thought
of
this
brick
wall
of
indifference
with
charlotte
hurling
herself
against
it
during
all
the
years
that
might
have
been
pleasant
was
so
tragic
to
me
that
i
was
nearly
tempted
to
try
to
please
her
by
offering
to
come
and
hurl
myself
too
but
i
have
no
heroism
the
hardness
and
coldness
of
bricks
terrifies
me
what
i
wondered
could
her
experiences
with
her
great
thinker
have
been
to
make
her
turn
her
back
so
absolutely
on
the
fair
and
sheltered
land
of
matrimony
i
could
not
but
agree
with
much
that
she
was
saying
that
women
if
they
chose
need
not
do
or
endure
any
of
the
things
against
which
those
of
them
who
find
their
voice
cry
out
has
long
been
clear
to
me
that
they
are
on
the
whole
not
towards
each
other
is
also
a
fact
frequently
to
be
observed
and
that
this
secret
antagonism
must
be
got
over
before
there
can
be
any
real
may
i
suppose
be
regarded
as
certain
but
when
charlotte
spoke
of
she
was
apparently
thinking
only
of
the
of
those
whom
years
in
place
of
the
might
of
youth
have
provided
with
the
sad
sensibleness
that
comes
of
repeated
disappointments
the
that
is
of
the
elderly
and
the
german
elderly
in
the
immense
majority
of
cases
remains
obscurely
in
her
kitchen
and
does
not
dream
of
has
she
not
got
over
the
conjugal
quarrels
of
the
first
married
years
has
she
not
filled
her
nurseries
and
become
indefinite
in
outline
and
do
not
these
things
make
for
content
if
thoughts
of
rebellion
enter
her
head
she
need
only
look
honestly
at
her
image
in
the
glass
to
be
aware
that
it
is
not
her
kind
that
will
ever
wring
concessions
from
the
other
sex
she
is
a
and
a
who
should
try
to
do
anything
beyond
keeping
her
home
tidy
and
feeding
its
inmates
would
be
almost
pathetically
ridiculous
should
bother
about
the
old
ones
i
murmured
watching
a
little
white
steamer
rounding
the
göhren
headland
the
young
to
my
dear
charlotte
the
young
inherit
the
earth
teutonic
earth
certainly
they
do
if
you
got
all
the
pretty
women
between
twenty
and
thirty
on
your
side
the
thing
done
no
wringing
would
be
required
the
concessions
would
simply
shower
down
detest
the
word
concession
said
charlotte
you
but
there
it
is
we
live
on
the
concessions
made
us
by
those
beings
you
would
probably
call
the
enemy
and
after
all
most
of
us
live
fairly
comfortably
the
way
she
said
turning
her
head
suddenly
and
looking
at
me
have
you
been
doing
all
these
years
i
repeated
in
some
confusion
i
do
know
why
there
should
have
been
any
confusion
unless
it
was
a
note
in
charlotte
voice
that
made
her
question
sound
like
a
stern
inquiry
after
that
one
talent
which
is
death
to
hide
lodged
with
me
useless
as
though
you
did
very
well
know
what
i
have
been
doing
i
have
had
a
row
of
babies
and
brought
it
up
quite
nicely
is
anything
to
be
proud
of
did
say
it
was
cat
achieves
precisely
the
same
thing
dear
charlotte
i
have
got
a
cat
now
what
are
you
doing
now
see
what
i
am
doing
apparently
exactly
what
you
are
do
mean
that
of
course
you
know
i
do
mean
that
what
are
you
doing
now
with
your
life
i
turned
my
head
and
gazed
reproachfully
at
charlotte
how
pretty
she
used
to
be
how
prettily
the
corners
of
her
mouth
used
to
turn
up
as
though
her
soul
were
always
smiling
and
she
had
had
the
dearest
chin
with
a
dimple
in
it
and
she
had
had
clear
hopeful
eyes
and
all
the
lines
of
her
body
had
been
comely
and
gracious
these
are
solid
advantages
that
should
not
lightly
be
allowed
to
go
not
a
trace
of
them
was
left
her
face
was
thin
and
its
expression
of
determination
made
it
look
hard
there
was
a
deep
line
straight
down
between
her
eyebrows
as
though
she
frowned
at
life
more
than
is
needful
angles
had
everywhere
taken
the
place
of
curves
her
eyes
were
as
bright
and
intelligent
as
ever
but
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
something
had
completely
done
for
charlotte
as
far
as
beauty
of
person
goes
whether
it
was
the
six
bernhards
or
her
actual
enthusiasms
or
the
unusual
mixture
of
both
i
could
not
at
this
stage
discover
nor
could
i
yet
see
if
her
soul
had
gained
the
beauty
that
her
body
had
lost
which
is
undoubtedly
what
the
rightly
soul
does
do
meanwhile
anything
more
utterly
unlike
the
wife
of
a
famous
professor
i
have
never
seen
the
wife
of
an
aged
german
celebrity
should
be
and
is
calm
comfortable
large
and
slow
she
must
be
and
is
proud
of
her
great
man
she
attends
to
his
bodily
wants
and
does
not
presume
to
share
his
spiritual
excitements
in
their
common
life
he
is
the
brain
she
the
willing
hands
and
feet
it
is
perfectly
fair
if
there
are
to
be
great
men
some
one
must
be
found
to
look
after
them
some
one
who
shall
be
more
patient
faithful
and
admiring
than
a
servant
and
unable
like
a
servant
to
throw
up
the
situation
on
the
least
provocation
a
wife
is
an
admirable
institution
she
is
the
hedge
set
between
the
precious
flowers
of
the
male
intellect
and
the
sun
and
dust
of
sordid
worries
she
is
the
flannel
that
protects
when
the
winds
of
routine
are
cold
she
is
the
sheltering
jam
that
makes
the
pills
of
life
possible
she
is
buffer
comforter
and
cook
and
so
long
as
she
enjoys
these
various
roles
the
arrangement
is
perfect
the
difficulties
begin
when
defying
nature
teaching
which
on
this
point
is
luminous
she
refuses
to
be
the
hedge
flannel
jam
buffer
comforter
and
cook
and
when
she
goes
so
far
on
the
sulphuric
path
of
rebellion
as
to
insist
on
being
clever
on
her
own
account
and
publicly
she
has
in
germany
at
least
set
every
law
of
religion
and
decency
at
defiance
charlotte
had
been
doing
this
if
all
i
had
heard
was
true
for
the
last
three
years
therefore
her
stern
inquiry
addressed
to
a
wife
of
my
sobriety
struck
me
as
singularly
out
of
place
what
had
i
been
doing
with
my
life
looking
back
into
it
in
search
of
an
answer
it
seemed
very
spacious
and
sunny
and
quiet
there
were
children
in
it
and
there
was
a
garden
and
a
spouse
in
whose
eyes
i
was
precious
but
i
had
not
done
anything
and
if
i
could
point
to
no
pamphlets
or
lectures
neither
need
i
point
to
a
furrow
between
my
eyebrows
is
very
odd
charlotte
went
on
as
i
sat
silent
meeting
like
this
i
was
on
the
verge
of
writing
to
ask
if
i
might
come
and
stay
with
you
were
you
often
lately
i
have
thought
just
you
might
be
such
a
help
to
me
if
only
i
could
wake
you
up
me
up
my
dear
charlotte
i
heard
about
you
i
know
you
live
stuffed
away
in
the
country
in
a
sort
of
dream
you
need
try
to
answer
my
question
about
what
you
have
done
you
ca
answer
it
you
have
lived
in
a
dream
entirely
wrapped
up
in
your
family
and
your
plants
my
dear
charlotte
do
not
see
nor
want
to
see
farther
than
the
ditch
at
the
end
of
your
garden
all
that
is
going
on
outside
out
in
the
great
real
world
where
people
are
in
earnest
where
they
strive
and
long
and
suffer
where
they
unceasingly
pursue
their
ideal
of
a
wider
life
a
richer
experience
a
higher
knowledge
is
absolutely
indifferent
to
you
your
existence
no
one
could
call
it
life
is
quite
negative
and
unemotional
it
is
as
negative
and
as
unemotional
as
she
paused
and
looked
at
me
with
a
faint
compassionate
smile
what
i
asked
anxious
to
hear
the
worst
as
an
oyster
my
dear
charlotte
i
exclaimed
naturally
upset
how
very
unfortunate
that
i
should
have
hurried
away
from
göhren
why
had
i
not
stayed
there
two
or
three
days
as
i
had
at
first
intended
it
was
such
a
safe
place
you
could
get
out
of
it
so
easily
and
so
quickly
if
i
were
an
oyster
curious
how
much
the
word
disconcerted
me
at
least
i
was
a
happy
oyster
which
was
surely
better
than
being
miserable
and
not
an
oyster
at
all
charlotte
was
certainly
nearer
being
miserable
than
happy
people
who
are
happy
do
not
have
the
look
she
had
in
her
eyes
nor
is
their
expression
so
uninterruptedly
determined
and
why
should
i
be
lectured
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
lecture
my
habit
is
to
buy
a
ticket
and
go
and
listen
and
when
i
have
not
bought
a
ticket
it
is
a
sign
that
i
do
not
want
a
lecture
i
did
not
like
to
explain
this
beautifully
simple
position
to
charlotte
yet
felt
that
at
all
costs
i
must
nip
her
eloquence
in
the
bud
or
she
would
keep
me
out
till
it
was
dark
so
i
got
up
cleared
my
throat
and
said
in
the
balmy
tone
in
which
people
on
platforms
begin
their
orations
you
going
to
give
me
a
lecture
she
inquired
with
a
surprised
smile
return
for
yours
dear
soul
may
i
not
talk
to
you
about
anything
except
plants
really
do
know
why
you
should
think
plants
are
the
only
things
that
interest
me
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
them
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
the
last
person
with
whom
i
would
share
my
vegetable
griefs
but
that
is
what
i
wished
to
say
i
was
going
to
offer
you
a
few
remarks
about
husbands
charlotte
frowned
husbands
i
repeated
blandly
in
a
voice
of
milk
and
honey
in
the
course
of
an
uneventful
existence
i
have
had
much
leisure
for
reflection
and
my
reflections
have
led
me
to
the
conclusion
erroneous
perhaps
but
fixed
that
having
got
a
husband
taken
him
of
one
own
free
will
taken
him
sometimes
even
in
the
face
of
opposition
the
least
one
can
do
is
to
stick
to
him
now
charlotte
where
is
yours
what
have
you
done
with
him
is
he
here
and
if
not
why
is
he
not
here
and
where
is
he
charlotte
got
up
hastily
and
brushed
the
sand
out
of
the
folds
of
her
dress
have
changed
a
bit
she
said
with
a
slight
laugh
are
just
as
i
suggested
i
did
say
that
and
as
for
bernhard
he
is
where
he
always
was
marching
triumphantly
along
the
road
to
undying
fame
but
you
know
that
you
only
ask
because
your
ideas
of
the
duties
of
woman
are
medieval
and
you
are
shocked
well
i
afraid
you
must
be
shocked
then
i
seen
him
for
a
whole
year
luckily
at
this
moment
for
i
think
we
were
going
to
quarrel
gertrud
came
heaving
through
the
sand
towards
us
with
a
packet
of
letters
she
had
been
to
the
post
and
knowing
i
loved
getting
letters
came
out
to
look
for
me
so
that
i
might
have
them
at
once
and
as
i
eagerly
opened
them
and
buried
myself
in
them
charlotte
confined
her
occasional
interjections
to
deprecating
the
obviously
inferior
shape
of
head
the
fifth
day
from
thiessow
to
sellin
many
a
time
have
i
wondered
at
the
unworthy
ways
of
fate
at
the
pettiness
of
the
pleasure
it
takes
in
frustrating
plans
that
are
small
and
innocent
at
its
entire
want
of
dignity
at
its
singular
spitefulness
at
the
resemblance
of
its
manners
to
those
of
an
but
never
have
i
wondered
more
than
i
did
that
night
at
thiessow
we
had
been
for
a
walk
after
tea
through
the
beechwood
up
a
hill
behind
it
to
the
signal
station
along
a
footpath
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
with
blue
gleams
of
sea
on
one
side
through
a
waving
fringe
of
blue
and
purple
flowers
and
the
ryefields
on
the
other
we
had
stood
looking
down
at
the
village
of
thiessow
far
below
us
a
cluster
of
picturesque
roofs
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
sunlit
water
had
gazed
across
the
vast
plain
to
the
distant
hill
and
village
of
gross
zickow
watched
the
shadows
passing
over
meadows
miles
away
seen
how
the
sea
to
the
west
had
the
calm
colours
of
a
pearl
how
the
sea
beneath
us
through
the
parting
stalks
of
scabious
and
harebells
was
quiet
but
very
blue
and
how
behind
us
over
the
there
was
the
eastern
sea
where
the
wind
was
as
brilliant
and
busy
and
as
before
it
was
all
very
wide
and
open
and
roomy
it
was
a
place
to
bless
god
in
and
cease
from
vain
words
and
when
the
stars
came
out
we
went
down
into
the
plain
and
wandered
out
across
the
dewy
grass
in
the
gathering
night
our
faces
towards
the
red
strip
of
sky
where
the
sun
had
set
charlotte
had
not
been
silent
all
this
time
she
had
been
on
the
contrary
passionately
explanatory
she
had
passionately
explained
the
intolerableness
of
her
life
with
the
famous
nieberlein
she
had
passionately
justified
her
action
in
cutting
it
short
and
listening
in
silence
i
had
soon
located
the
real
wound
the
place
she
did
not
mention
where
all
the
bruises
were
for
talk
and
explain
as
she
might
it
was
clear
that
her
chief
grievance
was
that
the
great
man
had
never
taken
her
seriously
to
be
strenuous
to
hold
intense
views
on
questions
that
seem
to
you
to
burn
and
to
be
treated
as
an
airy
nothing
a
charming
nothing
perhaps
but
still
a
nothing
must
be
on
the
whole
disconcerting
i
do
not
know
that
i
should
call
it
more
than
disconcerting
you
need
not
after
all
let
your
vision
be
blocked
entirely
by
the
person
with
whom
you
chance
to
live
however
vast
his
intellectual
bulk
may
be
you
can
look
round
him
and
see
that
the
stars
and
the
sky
are
still
there
and
you
need
not
run
away
from
him
to
do
that
if
the
great
nieberlein
had
not
taken
charlotte
sufficiently
seriously
she
had
manifestly
taken
him
much
too
seriously
it
is
better
to
laugh
at
one
nieberlein
than
to
be
angry
with
him
and
it
is
infinitely
more
personally
soothing
and
presently
you
find
you
have
grown
old
together
and
that
your
nieberlein
has
become
unaccountably
precious
and
that
you
do
not
want
to
laugh
at
all
or
if
you
do
it
is
a
very
tender
laughter
tender
almost
to
tears
and
then
as
we
walked
on
over
the
wonderful
starlit
plain
in
the
huge
hush
of
the
brooding
night
the
air
heavy
with
dew
and
the
smell
of
grass
cut
that
afternoon
in
distant
meadows
so
sweet
and
soft
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
smooth
away
every
line
of
midday
eagerness
from
our
tired
faces
charlotte
paused
and
before
i
had
done
praising
providence
for
this
refreshment
she
not
yet
having
paused
at
all
she
began
again
in
a
new
key
of
briskness
and
said
the
way
i
may
as
well
come
with
you
when
you
leave
this
i
have
nothing
particular
to
do
i
came
down
here
for
a
day
or
two
to
get
away
from
some
english
people
i
was
with
at
binz
who
had
rather
got
on
to
my
nerves
and
i
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
and
it
will
be
a
good
opportunity
we
can
talk
all
day
while
we
are
driving
talk
all
day
while
we
were
driving
if
hazlitt
saw
no
wit
in
talking
and
walking
i
see
less
than
none
in
talking
and
driving
it
was
this
speech
of
charlotte
that
set
me
marvelling
anew
at
the
maliciousness
of
fate
here
was
i
the
most
harmless
of
women
engaged
in
the
most
harmless
of
little
expeditions
asking
and
wanting
nothing
but
to
be
left
alone
a
person
so
obscure
as
to
be
one
would
think
altogether
out
of
the
reach
of
the
blind
fury
with
the
accursèd
shears
a
person
with
a
plan
so
mild
and
humble
that
i
was
ashamed
of
the
childishness
of
the
fate
that
could
waste
its
energies
spoiling
it
yet
before
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
i
was
confronted
with
the
old
familiar
inexorableness
taking
its
stand
this
time
on
the
impossibility
of
refusing
the
company
of
a
cousin
whom
you
have
not
seen
for
ten
years
charlotte
i
cried
seized
her
arm
convulsively
struggling
in
the
very
clutches
of
fate
what
a
good
idea
and
what
a
thousand
pities
that
it
ca
be
managed
you
see
it
is
a
victoria
and
there
are
only
two
places
because
of
all
the
luggage
so
that
we
ca
use
the
little
seat
or
gertrud
might
have
sat
on
that
send
her
home
what
do
you
want
with
gertrud
if
i
am
with
you
i
stared
dismayed
through
the
dusk
at
charlotte
determined
face
she
packs
i
said
be
so
helpless
as
though
two
healthy
women
could
wrap
up
their
own
it
is
only
i
went
on
still
struggling
everything
you
ca
think
how
much
i
loathe
buttoning
boots
i
know
i
never
would
button
them
but
go
about
with
them
undone
and
then
disgrace
you
and
i
do
want
to
do
that
but
that
is
it
really
either
i
went
on
hurriedly
for
charlotte
had
opened
her
mouth
to
tell
me
i
felt
certain
that
she
would
button
them
for
me
husband
never
will
let
me
go
anywhere
without
gertrud
you
see
she
looked
after
his
mother
too
and
he
thinks
awful
things
would
happen
if
i
had
got
her
i
very
sorry
charlotte
it
is
most
unfortunate
i
wish
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
bringing
the
omnibus
is
your
husband
such
an
absurd
tyrant
asked
charlotte
a
robust
scorn
for
my
flabby
obedience
in
her
voice
tyrant
i
ejaculated
casting
up
my
eyes
to
the
stars
and
mentally
begging
the
unconscious
innocent
pardon
then
we
must
get
a
luggage
cart
and
put
the
things
into
that
i
cried
seizing
her
arm
again
my
thoughts
whirling
round
in
search
of
a
loophole
of
escape
what
another
good
idea
gertrud
can
go
in
the
cart
too
she
can
what
what
a
trilogy
of
good
ideas
have
you
got
any
more
charlotte
what
a
resourceful
woman
you
are
i
believe
you
like
fighting
and
getting
over
difficulties
believe
i
do
said
charlotte
complacently
i
dropped
her
arm
ceased
to
struggle
walked
on
vanquished
henceforth
if
no
more
interesting
difficulties
presented
themselves
charlotte
was
going
to
spend
her
time
overcoming
me
and
besides
an
eloquent
charlotte
sitting
next
to
me
there
would
be
a
cart
rattling
along
behind
me
all
day
i
could
have
wept
at
the
sudden
end
to
the
peace
and
perfect
freedom
of
my
journey
i
went
to
bed
to
a
clean
and
pleasant
bed
that
at
another
time
would
have
pleased
me
strongly
of
opinion
that
life
was
not
worth
while
nor
did
it
comfort
me
that
from
my
pillow
i
looked
out
at
the
mysterious
dark
plain
with
its
roof
of
stars
and
its
faint
red
window
in
the
because
charlotte
had
opened
the
door
between
our
rooms
and
every
now
and
then
asked
me
if
i
were
asleep
i
lay
making
plans
for
the
circumvention
of
charlotte
and
rejecting
them
one
after
the
other
as
too
uncousinly
and
when
i
had
made
my
head
ache
with
the
difficulty
of
uniting
a
becoming
cousinliness
with
the
necessary
for
shaking
her
off
i
spent
my
time
feebly
deprecating
the
superabundance
of
cousins
in
the
world
surely
there
are
too
many
surely
almost
everybody
has
more
than
he
can
manage
comfortably
it
must
have
been
long
after
midnight
that
charlotte
herself
very
restless
called
out
once
more
to
know
if
i
were
asleep
i
am
i
answered
not
quite
kindly
i
fear
but
indeed
it
is
an
irritating
question
we
left
thiessow
at
ten
the
next
morning
under
a
grey
sky
and
drove
at
the
strong
recommendation
of
the
landlord
along
the
hard
sands
as
far
as
a
little
fishing
place
called
lobberort
where
we
struck
off
to
the
left
on
to
the
plain
again
and
so
came
once
more
to
philippshagen
and
the
high
road
that
runs
from
there
to
göhren
baabe
and
sellin
i
took
the
landlord
advice
willingly
because
i
did
not
choose
to
drive
on
that
grey
morning
in
my
altered
circumstances
over
the
plain
along
which
i
had
walked
so
happily
only
the
day
before
the
landlord
as
obliging
a
person
as
his
wife
was
a
capable
one
had
provided
a
cart
with
two
horses
who
were
to
come
with
us
as
far
as
binz
my
next
gertrud
sat
next
to
the
driver
of
this
cart
looking
grim
her
prospects
were
gloomy
for
the
seat
was
hard
the
driver
was
dirty
the
cart
had
no
springs
and
she
had
had
to
pack
charlotte
clothes
she
did
not
approve
of
the
frau
professor
how
should
she
gertrud
read
her
as
regularly
as
she
did
her
bible
and
believed
it
as
implicitly
she
knew
all
about
the
pamphlets
and
only
from
the
point
of
view
and
then
charlotte
made
the
mistake
clever
people
sometimes
do
of
too
readily
supposing
that
others
are
stupid
and
it
did
not
need
much
shrewdness
on
part
to
see
that
the
frau
professor
disliked
the
shape
of
her
head
the
drive
along
the
wet
sands
was
uninteresting
because
of
the
prevailing
greyness
of
sky
and
sea
but
the
waves
made
so
much
noise
that
charlotte
unable
to
get
anything
out
of
me
but
and
pointings
to
my
ears
gave
up
trying
to
talk
and
kept
quiet
the
luggage
cart
came
on
close
behind
the
lean
horses
showing
an
undesirable
skittishness
and
once
in
an
attempt
to
run
away
swerved
so
close
to
the
water
that
gertrud
gloom
became
absolutely
leaden
but
we
reached
lobberort
safely
ploughed
up
through
the
deep
sand
on
to
the
track
again
and
after
philippshagen
the
sky
cleared
the
sun
came
out
and
the
world
began
on
a
sudden
to
sparkle
we
did
not
see
göhren
again
the
road
very
hilly
just
there
passes
behind
it
between
steep
grassy
banks
blue
with
harebells
and
with
a
strip
of
brilliant
sky
above
it
between
the
tops
of
the
beeches
but
once
more
did
i
rattle
over
the
stones
of
the
lonely
one
pass
the
wooden
inn
where
the
same
people
seemed
to
be
drinking
the
same
beer
and
still
waiting
for
the
same
train
and
drive
along
the
dull
straight
bit
between
baabe
and
the
first
pines
of
sellin
at
sellin
we
were
going
to
lunch
rest
the
horses
and
then
late
in
the
afternoon
go
on
to
binz
sellin
from
this
side
is
a
with
a
very
deep
sandy
road
occasional
villas
appear
between
the
trees
and
becoming
more
frequent
join
into
a
string
and
form
one
side
of
the
road
after
passing
them
we
came
to
a
broad
gravel
road
at
right
angles
to
the
one
we
were
on
with
restaurants
and
villas
on
either
side
trim
rows
of
iron
and
stripling
chestnut
trees
and
a
wide
gap
at
the
end
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
below
which
lay
the
sea
this
was
the
real
sellin
this
single
wide
hot
road
with
its
glaring
white
houses
and
at
the
back
of
them
on
either
side
the
forest
brushing
against
their
windows
it
was
one
dinner
bells
were
ringing
all
down
the
street
visitors
were
streaming
up
from
the
sands
into
the
different
hotels
dishes
clattered
and
the
air
was
full
of
food
on
every
balcony
families
were
sitting
round
tables
waiting
for
the
servant
who
was
fetching
their
dinner
from
a
restaurant
down
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
the
sea
lay
in
perfect
quiet
a
heavenly
blue
out
of
reach
in
that
bay
of
the
wind
that
was
blowing
on
thiessow
there
was
no
wind
here
only
intense
heat
and
light
and
smells
of
cooking
we
leave
august
to
put
up
and
get
away
into
the
forest
and
let
gertrud
buy
some
lunch
and
bring
it
to
us
i
asked
charlotte
you
think
dinner
in
one
of
these
places
will
be
rather
horrid
sort
of
lunch
will
gertrud
buy
inquired
charlotte
cautiously
bread
and
eggs
and
fruit
and
things
it
is
enough
on
a
hot
day
like
this
dear
soul
it
is
not
enough
surely
it
is
foolish
to
starve
come
with
you
if
you
like
of
course
but
i
see
no
sense
in
not
being
properly
nourished
and
we
do
know
where
and
when
we
shall
get
another
meal
so
we
drove
on
to
the
end
hotel
from
whose
terrace
we
could
look
down
at
the
deserted
sands
and
the
wonderful
colour
of
the
water
august
and
the
driver
of
the
luggage
cart
put
up
gertrud
retired
to
a
neighbouring
cafe
and
we
sat
and
gasped
under
the
glass
roof
of
the
verandah
of
the
hotel
while
a
hot
waiter
brought
us
boiling
soup
it
is
a
barbarous
custom
this
of
dining
at
one
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
one
is
a
difficult
hour
to
manage
profitably
to
the
soul
there
is
something
peculiarly
base
about
it
it
is
the
hour
i
suppose
when
the
life
of
the
spirit
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
and
one
should
be
careful
not
to
extinguish
it
altogether
under
the
weight
of
a
gigantic
menu
i
know
my
spirit
fainted
utterly
away
at
the
aspect
of
those
plates
of
steaming
soup
and
at
the
smell
of
all
the
other
things
we
were
going
to
be
given
after
it
charlotte
ate
her
soup
calmly
and
complacently
it
did
not
seem
to
make
her
hotter
she
also
ate
everything
else
with
equal
calmness
and
remarked
that
full
brains
are
never
to
be
found
united
to
an
empty
stomach
a
full
stomach
is
often
to
be
found
united
to
empty
brains
i
replied
one
asserted
the
contrary
said
charlotte
and
took
some
more
i
thought
that
dinner
would
never
be
done
the
hotel
was
full
and
the
big
was
crowded
as
well
as
the
verandah
where
we
were
everybody
talked
at
once
and
the
noise
was
like
the
noise
of
the
parrot
house
at
the
zoological
gardens
it
looked
as
if
it
were
an
expensive
place
it
had
parquet
floors
and
flowers
on
the
tables
and
various
other
things
i
had
not
yet
come
across
in
rügen
and
when
the
bill
came
i
found
that
it
not
only
looked
so
but
was
so
all
the
more
then
was
i
astonished
at
the
numbers
of
families
with
many
children
and
the
necessary
fräulein
staying
in
it
how
did
they
manage
it
there
was
a
visitors
list
on
the
table
and
turning
it
over
i
found
that
none
of
them
in
the
nature
of
things
could
be
well
off
they
all
gave
their
occupations
and
the
majority
were
and
there
were
two
several
a
whatever
that
is
many
or
clerks
and
one
surely
who
must
have
found
the
place
beyond
his
means
a
all
these
had
wives
and
children
with
them
make
it
out
i
said
to
charlotte
ca
you
make
out
these
people
contrive
to
stay
weeks
in
a
dear
hotel
like
this
it
is
quite
simple
the
is
the
great
event
of
the
year
they
save
up
for
it
all
the
rest
of
the
year
they
live
at
home
as
frugally
as
possible
so
that
for
one
magnificent
month
they
can
pretend
to
waiters
and
chambermaids
and
the
other
visitors
that
they
are
richer
than
they
are
it
is
very
foolish
sadly
foolish
it
is
one
of
the
things
i
am
trying
to
persuade
women
to
give
up
you
are
doing
it
yourself
surely
there
is
a
difference
in
the
method
besides
i
was
run
down
so
i
should
think
were
the
poor
mothers
of
families
by
the
time
they
have
kept
house
frugally
for
a
year
and
if
it
makes
them
happy
why
not
that
is
another
of
the
things
i
am
working
to
persuade
them
to
give
up
being
happy
being
mothers
of
families
dear
charlotte
i
murmured
and
mused
in
silence
on
the
six
bernhards
unwieldily
big
ones
of
course
i
mean
what
do
you
understand
by
unwieldily
big
ones
i
asked
still
musing
on
the
bernhards
number
above
three
and
for
most
of
these
women
even
three
is
excessive
the
images
of
the
six
bernhards
troubled
me
so
much
that
i
could
not
speak
said
charlotte
the
women
here
all
of
them
or
any
of
them
the
one
at
the
opposite
table
for
instance
do
you
see
the
bulk
of
the
poor
soul
do
you
see
how
difficult
existence
must
be
made
for
her
by
that
circumstance
alone
how
life
can
be
nothing
to
her
but
uninterrupted
panting
she
does
walk
enough
i
suggested
ought
to
walk
round
rügen
once
a
year
instead
of
casting
anchor
in
the
of
sellin
looks
fifty
continued
charlotte
why
does
she
look
fifty
because
she
is
fifty
she
is
quite
young
but
those
four
awful
children
are
hers
and
no
doubt
there
is
a
baby
or
perhaps
two
babies
upstairs
and
they
have
finished
her
how
is
such
a
woman
to
realise
herself
how
can
she
work
out
her
own
salvation
what
energies
she
has
must
be
spent
on
her
children
and
if
ever
she
tries
to
think
she
must
fall
asleep
from
sheer
torpor
of
brain
now
why
should
she
be
deprived
of
the
use
of
her
soul
are
you
not
obscure
here
take
my
pudding
i
do
like
it
i
hoped
the
pudding
would
stem
the
stream
of
her
eloquence
i
feared
an
impending
lecture
she
had
resumed
the
pamphlet
manner
of
the
previous
afternoon
and
i
felt
very
helpless
she
took
the
pudding
and
i
was
dismayed
to
find
that
though
she
ate
it
it
had
no
effect
whatever
she
did
not
even
seem
to
know
she
was
eating
it
and
continued
to
address
me
with
vehemence
on
the
proper
treatment
of
female
souls
now
why
could
she
not
talk
on
this
subject
without
being
vehement
there
is
something
about
vehemence
that
freezes
responsiveness
out
of
me
i
suppose
it
is
what
charlotte
would
call
the
oyster
characteristics
coming
out
anyhow
by
the
time
the
waiter
brought
cheese
and
woolly
radishes
and
those
wicked
black
slabs
of
leather
called
i
was
sitting
quite
silent
and
charlotte
was
leaning
across
the
little
table
hurling
fiery
words
at
me
and
as
for
the
stout
lady
who
had
set
her
ablaze
she
ate
almonds
and
raisins
with
a
sublime
placidity
throwing
the
almonds
down
on
to
the
stone
floor
cracking
them
with
the
heel
of
her
boot
and
exhibiting
an
unexpected
nimbleness
in
picking
them
up
again
you
suppose
that
if
she
had
had
those
four
children
and
heaven
knows
how
many
besides
she
would
be
different
from
what
she
is
now
asked
charlotte
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
fixing
me
with
eyes
whose
brightness
dazzled
me
different
as
day
is
from
night
as
health
from
disease
as
briskness
from
torpor
she
have
looked
and
felt
ten
years
younger
she
have
had
all
her
energies
unimpaired
she
have
had
the
use
of
her
soul
her
time
her
individuality
now
it
is
too
late
all
that
has
been
choked
out
of
her
by
the
miserable
daily
drudgery
what
would
the
man
her
smug
husband
there
say
if
he
were
made
to
help
in
the
work
a
woman
is
expected
to
do
as
a
matter
of
course
yet
why
should
he
help
her
bear
her
burdens
why
should
he
take
them
on
his
stronger
shoulders
do
give
me
the
trite
answer
that
it
is
because
he
has
his
own
work
to
do
we
know
his
work
the
man
work
at
its
hardest
full
of
satisfactions
and
pleasures
and
hopes
and
ambitions
besides
coming
to
an
end
every
day
at
a
certain
hour
while
she
grows
old
in
hopeless
hideous
drudgery
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
that
makes
my
blood
boil
do
let
it
boil
i
cried
alarmed
so
hot
as
it
is
tell
you
i
think
that
woman
over
there
as
tragic
a
spectacle
as
it
would
be
possible
to
find
i
could
cry
over
her
poor
dumb
remnant
of
what
was
meant
to
be
the
image
of
god
dear
charlotte
i
murmured
uneasily
there
were
actual
tears
in
charlotte
eyes
where
i
saw
only
an
ample
lady
serenely
cracking
almonds
in
a
way
condemned
by
the
polite
charlotte
earnest
glance
pierced
the
veil
of
flesh
to
the
withered
stunted
soul
of
her
and
charlotte
was
so
sincere
was
so
honestly
grieved
by
the
hopeless
dulness
of
the
fulfilment
of
what
had
once
been
the
blithe
promise
of
young
girlhood
that
i
began
to
feel
distressed
too
and
cast
glances
of
respectful
sympathy
at
the
poor
lady
very
little
more
would
have
made
me
cry
but
i
was
saved
by
something
unexpected
for
the
waiter
came
round
with
letters
for
the
visitors
and
laying
two
by
the
lady
plate
he
said
quite
distinctly
and
we
both
heard
him
distinctly
für
fräulein
and
the
eldest
of
the
four
children
a
pert
little
girl
with
a
cried
out
ei
hast
du
heute
glück
tante
and
having
finished
our
dinner
we
got
up
and
went
on
our
way
in
silence
and
when
we
were
at
the
door
i
said
with
a
suavity
of
voice
and
manner
meant
to
be
healing
we
go
into
the
woods
charlotte
there
are
a
few
remarks
i
should
like
to
offer
you
on
the
souls
of
maiden
aunts
and
charlotte
said
with
some
petulance
that
the
principle
was
the
same
and
that
her
head
ached
and
would
i
mind
being
quiet
the
fifth
day
from
sellin
to
binz
suppose
a
being
who
should
be
neither
man
nor
woman
a
creature
wholly
removed
from
the
temptations
that
beset
either
sex
a
person
who
could
look
on
with
absolute
indifference
at
all
our
various
ways
of
wasting
life
untouched
by
the
ambitions
of
man
and
unstirred
by
the
longings
of
woman
what
would
such
a
being
think
of
the
popular
notion
against
which
other
uneasy
women
besides
charlotte
raise
their
voices
that
the
man
should
never
be
bothered
by
the
cares
of
the
house
and
the
babies
but
rather
go
his
daily
round
of
business
or
pleasure
precisely
as
he
did
before
he
had
his
house
and
his
babies
i
love
to
have
the
details
of
life
arranged
with
fastidious
justice
all
its
little
burdens
distributed
with
an
exact
fairness
among
those
who
have
to
carry
them
and
i
imagine
that
this
being
who
should
be
rather
more
than
man
and
less
than
god
who
should
understand
everything
and
care
nothing
would
call
it
wrong
to
allot
a
double
weight
to
the
strong
merely
because
he
is
strong
and
would
call
it
right
that
he
should
have
his
exact
share
and
use
the
strength
he
has
left
over
not
in
carrying
the
burden
of
some
weak
friend
who
burdenless
is
still
of
no
account
in
life
but
in
praising
god
going
first
and
showing
the
others
the
way
thus
did
i
meditate
walking
in
silence
by
charlotte
side
in
the
beech
forest
of
sellin
not
for
anything
would
i
have
put
my
meditations
into
words
well
aware
that
though
they
might
be
nourishing
to
me
they
would
poison
charlotte
the
maiden
aunt
and
the
dinner
together
had
given
charlotte
a
headache
which
i
respected
by
keeping
silent
and
for
two
hours
we
wandered
and
sat
about
among
the
beeches
sometimes
on
the
grassy
edge
of
the
cliffs
our
backs
against
tree
trunks
looking
out
over
the
brilliant
blue
water
with
its
brilliant
green
shallows
or
lying
in
the
grass
watching
the
fine
weather
clouds
floating
past
between
the
shining
those
were
glorious
hours
for
charlotte
dozed
most
of
the
time
and
it
was
almost
as
quiet
as
though
she
had
not
been
there
at
all
no
parted
the
branches
to
stare
at
us
they
were
sleeping
till
the
cool
of
the
day
no
pedestrians
with
came
to
look
at
the
view
and
ask
each
other
with
one
attentive
eye
on
us
if
it
were
not
colossal
no
warm
students
walked
along
wiping
their
foreheads
as
they
sang
of
love
and
beer
nothing
that
had
dined
at
a
could
possibly
move
in
such
heat
and
so
it
came
about
that
charlotte
and
i
shared
the
forest
only
with
birds
and
squirrels
this
forest
is
extremely
beautiful
it
stretches
for
miles
along
the
coast
and
is
full
of
paths
and
roads
that
lead
you
to
unexpected
lovelinesses
sudden
glimpses
of
the
sea
between
huge
beech
trunks
on
grassy
plateaus
deep
ravines
their
sides
clothed
with
moss
with
water
trickling
down
over
green
stones
to
the
sea
out
in
the
sun
at
the
bottom
silent
glades
of
bracken
silvery
in
the
afternoon
light
where
fallow
deer
examine
you
for
one
brief
moment
of
curiosity
before
they
spring
away
into
the
deeper
shadows
of
the
beeches
in
that
place
so
exquisite
whichever
way
i
looked
so
spacious
and
so
quiet
how
could
i
be
seriously
interested
in
stuffy
indoor
questions
such
as
the
equality
of
the
sexes
in
anything
but
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
the
joy
of
living
in
it
i
was
not
seriously
interested
i
doubt
if
i
have
ever
been
destiny
having
decided
that
i
shall
walk
through
life
petticoated
weighed
down
by
the
entire
range
of
disabilities
connected
with
german
petticoats
i
will
waste
no
time
arguing
there
it
is
the
inexorable
fact
and
there
it
will
remain
and
one
gets
used
to
the
disabilities
and
finds
on
looking
at
them
closer
that
they
exclude
nothing
that
is
really
worth
having
i
glanced
at
the
dozing
charlotte
half
inclined
to
wake
her
up
to
tell
her
this
and
exhort
her
to
do
as
the
dragons
in
the
glorious
verse
of
doctor
watts
who
changed
their
fierce
hissings
into
joyful
songs
and
praised
their
maker
with
their
forked
tongues
but
i
was
afraid
to
stir
her
up
lest
her
tongue
should
be
too
forked
and
split
my
arguments
to
pieces
so
she
dozed
on
undisturbed
and
i
enjoyed
myself
in
silence
repeating
gems
from
the
pages
of
the
immortal
doctor
echoes
of
the
days
when
i
lisped
in
numbers
that
were
not
only
infant
but
english
at
the
knee
of
a
pious
nurse
from
the
land
of
fogs
at
five
when
i
felt
that
a
gentle
shaking
of
charlotte
was
no
longer
avoidable
if
we
were
to
reach
binz
that
evening
and
was
preparing
to
apply
it
with
cousinly
gingerliness
an
obliging
who
had
been
swinging
deliciously
for
some
minutes
past
in
the
purple
flower
of
a
foxglove
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
backed
out
of
it
and
blundered
so
near
charlotte
face
that
he
brushed
it
with
his
wings
charlotte
instantly
sat
up
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
hard
at
me
such
is
the
suspiciousness
of
cousins
that
though
i
was
lying
half
a
dozen
yards
away
she
was
manifestly
of
opinion
that
i
had
tickled
her
this
annoyed
me
for
charlotte
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
would
think
of
tickling
there
was
something
about
her
that
would
make
it
impossible
however
sportively
disposed
i
might
be
and
besides
you
must
be
very
great
friends
before
you
begin
to
tickle
charlotte
and
i
were
cousins
but
we
were
as
yet
nowhere
near
being
very
great
friends
i
got
up
put
on
my
hat
and
said
rather
stiffly
for
she
still
sat
staring
that
it
was
time
to
go
we
walked
back
in
silence
each
feeling
resentful
and
keeping
along
the
cliff
passed
just
before
we
came
to
sellin
a
little
restaurant
of
coloured
glass
a
round
building
of
an
atrocious
ugliness
which
we
discovered
was
one
of
the
prides
of
sellin
for
afterwards
driving
through
the
forest
to
binz
all
the
had
fingers
pointing
in
its
direction
and
bore
the
inscription
pavilion
schönste
aussicht
the
was
indisputable
but
to
choose
the
loveliest
spot
and
blot
its
beauty
with
a
coloured
glass
restaurant
so
close
to
a
place
full
of
restaurants
is
surely
unusually
profane
there
it
is
however
and
all
day
long
it
industriously
scents
the
forest
round
it
with
the
smell
of
soup
people
were
beginning
to
gather
about
its
tables
the
people
we
had
seen
dining
and
who
had
slept
since
and
some
of
them
were
already
drinking
coffee
and
eating
slabs
of
cherry
cake
with
a
pile
of
whipped
cream
on
each
slab
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
had
had
nothing
since
breakfast
conspicuous
at
one
table
sat
the
maiden
aunt
still
rosy
from
her
sleep
she
too
had
ordered
cherry
cake
and
the
waiter
put
it
down
before
her
as
we
came
by
and
she
sat
for
a
moment
fondly
regarding
it
turning
the
plate
round
and
round
so
as
to
take
in
all
its
beauties
and
if
ever
a
woman
looked
happy
it
was
that
one
dumb
remnant
i
murmured
under
my
breath
charlotte
seemed
to
read
my
thoughts
for
she
turned
her
head
impatiently
away
from
the
cake
and
the
lady
and
said
once
again
and
defiantly
principle
is
the
same
of
course
course
said
i
the
drive
from
sellin
to
binz
was
by
far
the
most
beautiful
i
had
had
up
to
that
point
no
drive
had
been
uninterruptedly
beautiful
but
this
one
was
lovely
from
end
to
end
it
took
about
an
hour
and
a
half
and
we
were
the
whole
time
in
the
glorious
mixed
forest
belonging
to
prince
putbus
and
called
the
granitz
as
we
neared
binz
the
road
runs
down
close
to
the
sea
and
through
the
overhanging
branches
we
could
see
that
we
had
rounded
another
headland
and
were
in
another
bay
also
after
having
met
nothing
but
shy
troops
of
deer
we
began
to
pass
increasing
numbers
of
walking
slowly
taking
the
gentlest
of
exercise
before
their
evening
meal
charlotte
had
been
fairly
quiet
her
head
apparently
still
ached
but
suddenly
she
started
and
exclaimed
are
the
who
pray
are
the
i
inquired
following
the
direction
of
her
eyes
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
which
of
the
groups
of
tourists
were
the
they
were
going
in
the
same
direction
as
ourselves
a
tall
couple
in
clothes
of
surpassing
simplicity
and
excellence
immediately
afterwards
we
drove
past
them
charlotte
bowed
coldly
the
bowed
cordially
and
i
saw
that
the
young
man
was
my
philosophic
friend
of
the
afternoon
at
vilm
who
pray
are
the
i
asked
again
english
people
i
told
you
about
who
had
got
on
to
my
nerves
i
thought
they
have
left
by
now
why
were
they
on
your
nerves
she
a
bishop
wife
and
is
about
the
narrowest
person
i
have
met
so
we
not
likely
to
be
anywhere
but
on
each
other
nerves
but
she
adores
that
son
of
hers
and
would
do
anything
in
the
world
that
pleases
him
and
he
pursues
me
you
i
cried
with
an
incredulousness
that
i
immediately
perceived
was
rude
i
hastened
to
correct
it
by
shaking
my
head
in
gentle
reproof
and
saying
me
charlotte
dear
dear
me
simultaneously
i
was
conscious
of
feeling
disappointed
in
young
do
you
suppose
he
pursues
me
for
charlotte
asked
turning
her
head
and
looking
at
me
ca
think
i
was
going
to
say
but
stopped
in
time
most
absurd
reason
he
torments
me
with
attentions
because
i
am
bernhard
wife
he
is
a
and
he
says
bernhard
is
the
greatest
man
living
but
is
he
ca
get
hold
of
him
so
he
hovers
round
me
and
talks
bernhard
to
me
for
hours
together
that
why
i
went
to
thiessow
he
was
sending
me
mad
has
an
idea
poor
innocent
that
you
do
that
you
no
longer
have
as
much
courage
as
other
people
but
i
do
think
enough
of
it
for
explaining
things
to
the
mother
you
see
she
the
wife
of
a
bishop
not
being
so
well
acquainted
as
charlotte
with
the
characteristics
of
the
wives
of
bishops
i
did
not
see
but
she
seemed
to
think
it
explained
everything
she
know
about
your
writings
i
inquired
yes
and
she
came
to
a
lecture
i
gave
at
oxford
the
boy
is
at
balliol
and
she
read
some
of
the
pamphlets
he
made
her
she
made
a
few
conventional
remarks
that
showed
me
her
limitations
and
then
she
began
about
bernhard
to
these
people
i
have
no
individuality
no
separate
existence
no
brains
of
my
own
no
opinions
worth
listening
to
i
am
solely
of
interest
as
the
wife
of
bernhard
oh
it
maddening
the
boy
has
put
i
do
know
what
ideas
into
his
mother
head
she
has
actually
tried
to
read
one
of
bernhard
works
and
she
pretends
she
thought
it
sublime
she
quotes
it
i
wo
stay
at
binz
let
us
go
on
somewhere
else
i
think
binz
looks
as
if
it
were
a
lovely
place
and
the
look
very
nice
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
want
to
go
on
somewhere
else
i
go
on
alone
and
wait
for
you
at
sassnitz
do
wait
i
might
come
to
sassnitz
well
i
be
sure
to
pick
you
up
again
somewhere
it
is
a
very
big
island
and
you
are
a
conspicuous
object
driving
round
it
this
was
true
so
long
as
i
was
on
that
island
i
could
not
hope
to
escape
charlotte
i
entered
binz
in
a
state
of
moody
acquiescence
every
hotel
was
full
and
every
room
in
the
villas
was
taken
it
was
the
göhren
experience
over
again
at
last
we
found
shelter
by
the
merest
chance
in
the
prettiest
house
in
the
place
we
had
not
dared
inquire
there
certain
that
its
rooms
would
be
taken
first
of
all
a
little
house
on
the
sands
overhung
at
the
back
by
beechwoods
its
windows
garnished
with
bright
yellow
damask
curtains
its
roof
very
red
and
its
walls
very
white
a
most
cheerful
trim
little
house
with
a
nice
tiled
path
up
to
the
door
and
pots
of
geraniums
on
its
sills
a
cleanly
person
of
the
usual
decent
widow
type
welcomed
us
with
a
cordiality
contrasting
pleasantly
with
the
indifference
of
those
widows
whose
rooms
had
been
all
engaged
the
entire
lower
floor
she
said
was
at
our
disposal
we
each
had
a
bedroom
opening
on
to
a
verandah
that
seemed
to
hang
right
over
the
sea
and
there
was
a
and
a
beautiful
kitchen
if
we
wanted
to
cook
and
a
spacious
chamber
for
gertrud
the
price
was
low
even
when
i
said
that
we
should
probably
only
stay
one
or
two
nights
it
did
not
go
up
the
widow
explained
that
the
rooms
were
engaged
for
the
entire
season
but
that
the
berlin
gentleman
who
had
taken
them
was
unavoidably
prevented
coming
which
was
the
reason
why
we
might
have
them
for
it
was
not
her
habit
to
take
in
the
passing
stranger
i
asked
whether
it
were
likely
that
the
berlin
gentleman
might
yet
appear
and
turn
us
out
she
stared
at
me
a
moment
as
though
struck
by
my
question
and
then
shook
her
head
no
she
said
decidedly
will
not
appear
a
very
pretty
little
maidservant
who
was
bringing
in
our
luggage
was
so
much
perturbed
by
my
innocent
inquiry
that
she
let
the
things
drop
do
not
be
a
fool
said
the
widow
sternly
gentleman
she
went
on
turning
to
me
can
not
come
because
he
is
dead
i
said
silenced
by
the
excellence
of
the
reason
charlotte
being
readier
of
speech
said
the
reason
was
a
good
one
but
when
i
heard
it
it
seemed
as
if
the
pleasant
rooms
with
the
beds
all
ready
and
everything
set
out
for
the
expected
one
took
on
a
look
of
awfulness
it
is
true
it
was
now
past
eight
and
the
sun
had
gone
and
across
the
bay
the
dusk
was
creeping
i
went
out
through
the
long
windows
to
the
little
verandah
it
had
white
pillars
of
great
apparent
massiveness
which
looked
as
though
they
were
meant
to
support
vast
weights
of
masonry
and
through
them
i
watched
the
water
rippling
in
slow
steely
ripples
along
the
sand
just
beneath
me
and
the
ripples
had
the
peculiar
lonely
sound
that
slight
waves
have
in
the
evening
when
they
lick
a
deserted
shore
was
he
expected
i
heard
charlotte
within
the
room
ask
in
a
depressed
voice
said
the
widow
echoed
charlotte
is
why
the
beds
are
made
it
is
lucky
for
you
ladies
agreed
charlotte
and
her
voice
was
hollow
died
yesterday
an
accident
i
received
the
telegram
only
this
morning
it
is
a
great
misfortune
for
me
will
the
ladies
sup
i
have
some
provisions
in
the
house
sent
on
by
the
gentleman
for
his
supper
he
poor
soul
will
never
sup
again
the
widow
more
moved
by
this
last
reflection
than
she
had
yet
been
sighed
heavily
she
then
made
the
observation
usual
on
such
occasions
that
it
is
a
strange
world
and
that
one
is
here
and
gone
or
rather
correcting
herself
here
yesterday
and
gone
and
that
the
one
thing
certain
was
the
at
that
moment
on
the
shelves
of
the
larder
would
the
ladies
not
seize
the
splendid
opportunity
and
sup
no
we
will
not
sup
charlotte
cried
with
great
decision
wo
eat
here
will
you
she
asked
through
the
yellow
which
made
her
look
very
pale
is
always
horrid
in
lodgings
shall
we
go
to
that
nice
hotel
we
passed
where
the
people
were
sitting
under
the
big
tree
looking
so
happy
we
went
in
silence
to
the
hotel
and
threading
our
way
among
the
crowded
tables
set
out
under
a
huge
beech
tree
a
few
yards
from
the
water
to
the
only
empty
one
we
found
ourselves
sitting
next
to
the
frau
nieberlein
how
delightful
to
have
you
here
again
cried
the
bishop
wife
in
tones
of
utmost
cordiality
leaning
across
the
little
space
between
the
tables
to
press
charlotte
hand
has
been
scouring
the
country
on
his
bicycle
trying
to
discover
your
retreat
and
was
quite
disconsolate
at
not
finding
you
scouring
the
country
in
search
of
charlotte
heavens
and
i
who
had
dropped
straight
on
top
of
her
in
the
waters
of
thiessow
without
any
effort
at
all
thus
does
fortune
withhold
blessings
from
those
who
clamour
and
piles
them
unasked
on
the
shrinking
heads
of
the
meek
brosy
meanwhile
like
a
polite
young
man
acquainted
with
german
customs
had
got
out
of
his
chair
and
was
waiting
for
charlotte
to
present
him
to
me
yes
my
young
philosopher
i
thought
not
without
a
faint
regret
are
now
to
find
out
that
your
promising
and
intellectual
fräulein
is
anything
of
the
sort
present
me
said
brosy
charlotte
did
present
me
i
said
in
my
turn
bowing
in
the
direction
of
the
bishop
wife
charlotte
did
at
this
ceremony
the
bishop
wife
face
took
on
the
look
of
one
who
thinks
there
is
really
no
need
to
make
fresh
acquaintances
in
breathless
hurries
it
also
wore
the
look
of
one
who
while
admitting
a
nieberlein
within
the
range
of
her
cordiality
on
account
of
the
prestige
of
that
nieberlein
famous
husband
does
not
see
why
the
nieberlein
obscure
female
relatives
should
be
admitted
too
so
i
was
not
admitted
and
i
sat
outside
and
studied
the
menu
very
strange
observed
brosy
in
his
beautifully
correct
german
as
he
dropped
into
a
vacant
chair
at
our
table
you
should
be
related
to
the
nieberleins
is
always
related
to
somebody
i
replied
and
marvelled
at
my
own
intelligence
how
odd
that
we
should
meet
again
here
is
always
meeting
again
on
an
island
if
it
is
small
enough
this
is
a
sample
of
my
conversation
with
brosy
weighty
on
my
part
with
solid
truths
while
our
supper
was
being
prepared
and
while
charlotte
answered
his
mother
questions
as
to
where
she
had
been
where
she
had
met
me
how
we
were
related
and
who
my
husband
was
husband
is
a
farmer
i
heard
charlotte
say
in
the
dreary
voice
of
hopeless
boredom
really
how
interesting
said
and
immediately
ceased
to
be
interested
the
lights
of
sassnitz
twinkled
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
a
steamer
came
across
the
calm
grey
water
gaily
decked
out
in
coloured
lights
the
throbbing
of
her
heard
almost
from
the
time
she
left
sassnitz
in
the
still
evening
air
up
and
down
the
road
between
our
tables
and
the
sea
groups
of
strolled
artless
family
groups
papa
and
mamma
arm
in
arm
and
in
front
the
daughter
and
the
admirer
knots
of
girls
in
the
stage
tittering
and
pushing
each
other
about
quiet
placid
after
their
supper
gently
praising
as
they
passed
the
delights
of
a
few
weeks
spent
in
the
very
bosom
of
nature
expatiating
on
her
peace
her
restfulness
and
the
freshness
of
her
vegetables
and
with
us
while
the
stars
flashed
through
the
stirring
beech
leaves
rhapsodised
about
the
great
nieberlein
to
the
blank
charlotte
and
brosy
tried
to
carry
on
a
reasonable
conversation
about
things
like
souls
with
a
woman
who
was
eating
an
omelette
i
was
in
an
entirely
different
mood
from
the
one
of
the
afternoon
at
vilm
and
it
was
a
mood
in
which
i
like
to
be
left
alone
when
it
is
on
me
not
all
the
beautiful
young
men
in
the
world
looking
like
archangels
and
wearing
the
loveliest
linen
would
be
able
to
shake
me
out
of
it
brosy
was
apparently
in
exactly
the
same
mood
as
he
had
been
then
was
it
his
perennially
did
he
always
want
to
talk
about
the
unknowable
and
the
unthinkable
and
the
unspeakable
i
am
positive
i
did
not
look
intelligent
this
time
not
only
because
i
did
not
try
to
but
because
i
was
feeling
profoundly
stupid
and
still
he
went
on
there
was
only
one
thing
i
really
wanted
to
know
and
that
was
why
he
was
called
brosy
while
i
ate
my
supper
and
he
talked
and
his
mother
listened
during
the
pauses
of
her
fitful
conversation
with
charlotte
i
turned
this
over
in
my
mind
why
brosy
his
mother
kept
on
saying
it
to
charlotte
her
talk
having
done
with
nieberlein
was
all
of
brosy
was
it
in
itself
a
perfect
name
or
was
it
the
short
of
something
long
or
did
it
come
under
the
heading
pet
was
he
perhaps
a
twin
and
his
twin
sister
was
rosy
in
which
case
if
his
parents
were
lovers
of
the
neat
his
own
name
would
be
almost
inevitable
it
was
when
our
supper
had
been
cleared
away
and
he
was
remarking
for
the
second
time
the
first
time
he
remarked
it
i
had
said
that
ultimate
religious
ideas
are
merely
symbols
of
the
actual
not
cognitions
of
it
and
his
mother
not
well
knowing
what
he
meant
but
afraid
it
must
be
something
a
bishop
son
ought
not
to
mean
said
with
gentle
reproach
dear
brosy
that
i
took
courage
to
inquire
of
him
brosy
is
short
for
ambrose
he
answered
was
christened
after
ambrose
said
his
mother
one
of
the
early
fathers
as
no
doubt
you
know
but
i
did
not
know
because
she
spoke
in
german
for
the
sake
i
suppose
of
making
things
easier
for
me
and
she
called
the
early
fathers
so
how
could
i
know
väter
i
repeated
dully
are
they
the
bishop
wife
took
the
kindest
view
of
it
you
do
not
have
them
in
the
lutheran
church
she
said
but
she
did
not
speak
to
me
again
at
all
turning
her
back
on
me
quite
this
time
and
wholly
concentrating
her
attention
on
the
monosyllabic
charlotte
mother
ambrose
explained
in
subdued
tones
to
say
am
sorry
said
i
politely
i
was
so
dull
and
then
he
went
on
with
the
paragraph
for
to
me
it
seemed
as
though
he
spoke
always
in
entire
paragraphs
instead
of
sentences
he
had
been
engaged
upon
when
i
interrupted
him
and
for
my
refreshment
i
caught
fragments
of
conversation
in
between
have
a
message
for
you
dear
frau
nieberlein
i
heard
her
say
message
from
the
bishop
said
charlotte
without
warmth
had
letters
from
home
and
in
his
he
mentions
you
said
charlotte
ungratefully
cold
tell
her
he
writes
tell
her
i
have
been
reading
her
pamphlets
said
charlotte
beginning
to
warm
is
not
often
that
the
bishop
has
time
for
reading
and
it
is
quite
unusual
for
him
to
look
at
anything
written
by
a
woman
so
that
it
is
really
an
honour
he
has
paid
you
course
it
is
said
charlotte
quite
warmly
he
is
an
old
man
dear
frau
nieberlein
of
ripe
experience
and
admirable
wisdom
as
no
doubt
you
have
heard
and
i
am
sure
you
will
take
what
he
says
in
good
part
this
sounded
ominous
so
charlotte
said
nothing
tell
her
he
writes
tell
her
that
i
grieve
for
her
there
was
a
pause
then
charlotte
said
loftily
is
very
good
of
him
i
can
assure
you
the
bishop
never
grieves
without
reason
or
else
in
such
a
large
diocese
he
would
always
be
doing
it
charlotte
was
silent
begged
me
to
tell
you
that
he
will
pray
for
you
there
was
another
pause
then
charlotte
said
you
what
else
was
she
to
say
what
does
one
say
in
such
a
case
our
governesses
teach
us
how
pleasant
and
amiable
an
adornment
is
politeness
but
not
one
of
mine
ever
told
me
what
i
was
to
say
when
confronted
by
an
announcement
that
i
was
to
be
included
in
prayers
if
charlotte
anxious
to
be
polite
had
said
please
let
him
trouble
the
bishop
wife
would
have
been
shocked
if
she
had
said
what
she
felt
and
wholly
declined
to
be
prayed
for
at
all
by
strange
bishops
would
have
been
horrified
it
is
a
nice
question
and
it
preoccupied
me
for
the
rest
of
the
time
we
sat
there
and
we
sat
there
a
very
long
time
for
although
charlotte
was
manifestly
sorely
tried
by
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
her
away
each
time
i
suggested
going
back
to
our
lodgings
to
bed
she
made
some
excuse
for
staying
where
she
was
everybody
else
seemed
to
have
gone
to
bed
and
even
ambrose
who
had
been
bicycling
all
day
had
begun
visibly
to
droop
before
i
could
persuade
her
to
come
home
slowly
she
walked
along
the
silent
sands
slowly
she
went
into
the
house
still
more
slowly
into
her
bedroom
and
then
just
as
gertrud
had
blessed
me
and
blown
out
my
candle
in
one
breath
in
she
came
with
a
light
and
remarking
that
she
did
not
feel
sleepy
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
my
bed
and
began
to
talk
she
had
on
a
white
and
her
hair
fell
loose
about
her
face
and
she
was
very
pale
ca
talk
i
am
much
too
sleepy
i
said
you
look
dreadfully
tired
soul
is
tired
tired
out
utterly
by
that
woman
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
you
wo
come
away
with
me
ca
go
away
till
i
have
explored
these
heavenly
forests
ca
stay
here
if
i
am
to
spend
my
time
with
that
woman
woman
oh
charlotte
do
call
her
such
awful
names
try
and
imagine
her
sensations
if
she
heard
you
i
should
care
hush
i
whispered
windows
are
open
she
might
be
just
outside
on
the
beach
it
gives
me
shivers
only
to
think
of
it
do
say
it
again
do
be
such
an
audacious
german
think
of
oxford
think
of
venerable
things
like
cathedral
closes
and
bishops
palaces
think
of
the
dignity
and
deference
that
surround
at
home
and
wo
you
go
to
bed
you
ca
think
how
sleepy
i
am
you
come
away
with
me
talk
it
over
in
the
morning
i
not
nearly
awake
enough
now
charlotte
got
up
reluctantly
and
went
to
the
door
leading
into
her
bedroom
then
she
came
back
and
crossed
over
to
the
windows
and
peeped
out
between
the
yellow
curtains
bright
moonlight
she
said
so
quiet
the
sea
is
like
a
pond
how
clear
the
sassnitz
lights
are
they
i
murmured
drowsily
you
really
going
to
leave
your
windows
open
any
one
can
get
in
we
are
almost
on
a
level
with
the
beach
to
this
i
made
no
answer
and
my
little
on
the
table
gave
point
to
my
silence
by
chiming
twelve
charlotte
went
away
slowly
candle
in
hand
at
her
door
she
stopped
and
looked
back
seems
she
said
i
have
got
that
unfortunate
man
bed
so
it
was
the
berlin
gentleman
who
was
making
her
restless
you
she
went
on
got
the
one
his
daughter
was
to
have
had
she
alive
i
asked
sleepily
yes
she
alive
that
was
nice
anyway
believe
you
are
frightened
i
murmured
as
she
still
lingered
what
of
berlin
gentleman
said
charlotte
and
went
away
i
was
having
a
most
cheerful
dream
in
which
i
tried
hard
to
remember
the
exact
words
herbert
spencer
uses
about
effete
beliefs
that
in
the
stole
still
cling
about
the
necks
of
priests
and
in
gaiters
linger
round
the
legs
of
bishops
and
was
repeating
the
words
about
the
bishops
in
a
rapture
of
enjoyment
and
indeed
it
is
a
lovely
sentence
when
a
sudden
pause
of
fear
came
into
my
dream
and
i
felt
that
some
one
beside
myself
was
in
the
room
the
dark
to
me
has
always
been
full
of
terrors
i
can
look
back
through
my
memories
and
find
past
years
studded
with
horrible
black
nights
on
which
i
woke
up
and
was
afraid
till
i
have
lit
a
candle
how
can
i
remember
that
i
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
and
in
nameless
hideousnesses
infinitely
more
frightful
than
ghosts
but
what
courage
is
needed
to
sit
up
in
all
the
solid
pressing
blackness
and
stretch
out
one
defenceless
hand
into
it
to
feel
about
for
the
matches
appalled
by
the
echoing
noises
the
search
produces
cold
with
fear
that
the
hand
may
touch
something
unknown
and
terrible
and
so
at
binz
dragged
out
of
my
pleasant
dream
to
night
and
loneliness
i
could
not
move
for
a
moment
for
sheer
extremity
of
fright
when
i
did
when
i
did
put
out
a
shaking
hand
to
feel
for
the
matches
the
dread
of
years
became
a
reality
i
touched
another
hand
now
i
think
it
was
very
wonderful
of
me
not
to
scream
i
suppose
i
did
not
dare
i
do
know
how
i
managed
it
petrified
as
i
was
with
terror
but
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
i
found
myself
under
the
bedclothes
thinking
things
over
whose
hand
had
i
touched
and
what
was
it
doing
on
my
table
it
was
a
nasty
cold
hand
and
it
had
clutched
at
mine
as
i
tore
it
away
oh
there
it
was
coming
after
me
it
was
feeling
its
way
along
the
bedclothes
surely
it
was
not
real
it
must
be
a
nightmare
and
that
was
why
no
sound
came
when
i
tried
to
shriek
for
charlotte
but
what
a
horrible
nightmare
so
very
very
real
i
could
hear
the
hand
sliding
along
the
sheet
to
the
corner
where
i
was
huddling
oh
why
had
i
come
to
this
frightful
island
a
gasp
of
helpless
horror
did
get
out
and
instantly
charlotte
voice
whispered
quiet
do
make
a
sound
there
a
man
outside
your
window
at
this
my
senses
came
back
to
me
with
a
rush
nearly
killed
me
i
whispered
filling
the
whisper
with
as
much
hot
indignation
as
it
would
hold
my
heart
had
had
anything
the
matter
with
it
i
would
have
died
let
me
go
i
want
to
light
the
candle
what
does
a
man
a
real
living
man
matter
charlotte
held
me
tighter
quiet
she
whispered
in
an
agony
it
seemed
of
fear
quiet
he
is
he
does
look
i
do
think
he
is
alive
i
whispered
sh
your
window
open
he
only
need
put
his
leg
over
the
sill
to
get
in
if
he
is
alive
he
ca
put
his
leg
over
sills
i
whispered
back
incredulously
some
poor
drowned
sailor
washed
ashore
be
implored
charlotte
burying
her
face
on
my
shoulder
and
having
got
over
my
own
fright
i
marvelled
at
the
abjectness
of
hers
me
go
i
want
to
look
at
him
i
said
trying
to
get
away
sh
do
move
he
hear
he
is
just
outside
and
she
clung
to
me
in
terror
how
can
he
hear
if
he
is
alive
let
me
go
no
he
sitting
there
just
outside
he
been
sitting
there
for
hours
and
never
moves
oh
it
that
man
i
know
it
is
i
knew
come
man
the
dreadful
dreadful
berlin
man
who
died
dear
charlotte
i
expostulated
feeling
now
perfectly
calm
in
the
presence
of
such
a
collapse
me
go
i
look
through
the
curtains
so
that
he
shall
not
see
me
and
i
soon
tell
you
if
he
alive
or
not
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
a
live
man
when
i
see
one
i
wriggled
out
of
her
arms
and
crept
with
bare
silent
feet
to
the
window
and
cautiously
moving
the
curtains
a
slit
apart
peeped
through
there
certainly
was
a
man
outside
sitting
on
a
rock
exactly
in
front
of
my
window
with
his
face
to
the
sea
clouds
were
passing
slowly
across
the
moon
and
i
waited
for
them
to
pass
to
see
him
more
clearly
he
never
moved
and
when
the
light
did
fall
on
him
it
fell
on
a
back
with
two
shining
buttons
on
it
not
the
back
of
a
burglar
and
surely
not
the
back
of
a
ghost
in
all
my
varied
imaginings
i
had
never
yet
imagined
a
ghost
in
buttons
and
i
refused
to
believe
that
i
saw
one
then
back
i
crept
to
the
cowering
charlotte
is
anybody
who
dead
i
whispered
cheerfully
i
think
he
wants
to
paddle
echoed
charlotte
sitting
up
the
word
seeming
to
restore
her
to
her
senses
should
he
want
to
paddle
in
the
middle
of
the
night
why
not
it
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
that
makes
you
sit
on
rocks
charlotte
was
so
much
recovered
and
so
much
relieved
at
finding
herself
recovered
that
she
gave
a
hysterical
giggle
instantly
there
was
a
slight
noise
outside
and
the
shadow
of
a
man
appeared
on
the
curtains
we
clung
to
each
other
in
consternation
whispered
the
man
pushing
the
curtains
a
little
aside
and
peering
into
the
darkness
of
the
room
schatz
endlich
da
lässt
mich
so
lange
he
waited
uncertain
trying
to
see
in
charlotte
grasped
the
situation
quickest
is
not
here
she
said
with
immense
dignity
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
disturbing
ladies
in
this
manner
i
must
request
you
to
go
away
at
once
and
to
give
me
your
name
and
address
so
that
i
may
report
you
to
the
proper
authorities
i
shall
not
fail
in
my
duty
which
will
be
to
make
an
example
of
you
was
admirably
put
i
remarked
going
across
to
the
window
and
shutting
it
he
did
stay
to
listen
now
we
light
the
candle
and
looking
out
as
i
drew
the
curtains
i
saw
the
moonlight
flash
on
flying
buttons
would
have
thought
i
observed
to
charlotte
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
shaking
with
indignation
would
have
thought
that
that
very
demure
little
hedwig
would
be
the
cause
of
a
night
of
terror
for
us
could
have
imagined
her
so
depraved
said
charlotte
wrathfully
we
do
know
that
she
is
it
look
like
it
little
thing
little
thing
what
drivel
is
this
i
do
know
we
all
want
forgiving
very
badly
it
seems
to
me
hedwig
not
more
than
you
and
i
and
we
want
it
so
much
more
badly
than
we
want
punishing
yet
we
are
always
getting
punished
and
hardly
ever
getting
forgiven
do
know
what
you
mean
said
charlotte
is
very
clear
i
admitted
the
sixth
day
the
jagdschloss
she
was
asleep
next
morning
when
i
looked
into
her
bedroom
so
i
shut
the
door
softly
and
charging
gertrud
not
to
disturb
her
went
out
for
a
walk
it
was
not
quite
eight
and
people
had
not
got
away
from
their
coffee
yet
so
i
had
it
to
myself
the
walk
along
the
shore
beneath
the
beeches
beside
the
flashing
morning
sea
the
path
runs
along
for
a
little
close
to
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
hill
that
shuts
the
west
winds
out
of
binz
a
hill
steep
enough
and
high
enough
to
make
him
pant
grievously
who
goes
up
it
after
dinner
then
on
the
right
comes
a
deep
narrow
cutting
running
up
into
the
woods
cut
it
seems
entirely
out
of
smoothest
greenest
moss
so
completely
are
its
sides
covered
with
it
standing
midway
up
this
cutting
in
the
soft
gloom
of
its
green
walls
with
the
branches
of
the
beeches
meeting
far
away
above
and
down
at
the
bottom
the
sheet
of
shining
water
i
found
absolutely
the
most
silent
bit
of
the
world
i
have
ever
been
in
the
silence
was
wonderful
there
seemed
positively
to
be
no
sound
at
all
no
sound
came
down
from
the
beech
leaves
and
yet
they
were
stirring
no
sound
came
up
from
the
water
not
a
ripple
not
a
splash
i
heard
no
birds
while
i
stood
there
nor
any
hum
of
insects
it
might
have
been
the
entrance
to
some
holy
place
so
strange
and
solemn
was
the
quiet
and
looking
from
out
of
its
shadows
to
the
brightness
shining
at
the
upper
end
where
the
sun
was
flooding
the
bracken
with
happy
morning
radiance
i
felt
suddenly
that
my
walk
had
ceased
to
be
a
common
thing
and
that
i
was
going
up
into
the
temple
of
god
to
pray
i
know
no
surer
way
of
shaking
off
the
dreary
crust
formed
about
the
soul
by
the
trying
to
do
one
duty
or
the
patient
enduring
of
having
somebody
else
duty
done
to
one
than
going
out
alone
either
at
the
bright
beginning
of
the
day
when
the
earth
is
still
unsoiled
by
the
feet
of
the
strenuous
and
only
god
is
abroad
or
in
the
evening
when
the
hush
has
come
out
to
the
blessed
stars
and
looking
up
at
them
wonder
at
the
meanness
of
the
day
just
past
at
the
worthlessness
of
the
things
one
has
struggled
for
at
the
folly
of
having
been
so
angry
and
so
restless
and
so
much
afraid
nothing
focusses
life
more
exactly
than
a
little
while
alone
at
night
with
the
stars
what
are
perfunctory
bedroom
prayers
hurried
through
in
an
atmosphere
of
blankets
to
this
deep
abasement
of
the
spirit
before
the
majesty
of
heaven
and
as
a
consecration
of
what
should
be
yet
one
more
happy
day
of
what
value
are
those
hasty
morning
devotions
disturbed
by
fears
lest
the
coffee
should
be
getting
cold
and
that
person
present
in
every
household
whose
property
is
always
to
reprove
be
more
than
usually
provoked
compared
to
going
out
into
the
freshness
of
the
new
day
and
thanking
god
deliberately
under
his
own
wide
sky
for
having
been
so
good
to
us
i
know
that
when
i
had
done
my
up
there
in
the
space
among
the
shimmering
bracken
i
went
on
my
way
with
a
lightheartedness
never
mine
after
indoor
religious
exercises
the
forest
was
so
gay
that
morning
so
sparkling
so
full
of
busy
happy
creatures
it
would
have
been
a
sorry
heart
that
did
not
feel
jolly
in
such
society
in
that
wholesomeness
there
was
no
room
for
repentance
no
place
for
beating
of
the
breast
and
indeed
i
think
we
waste
a
terrible
amount
of
time
repenting
the
healthy
attitude
the
only
reasonable
one
towards
a
fault
made
or
a
sin
committed
is
surely
a
vigorous
shake
of
one
moral
shoulders
vigorous
enough
to
shake
it
off
and
out
of
remembrance
the
sin
itself
was
a
sad
waste
of
time
and
happiness
and
absolutely
no
more
should
be
wasted
in
lugubriously
reflecting
on
it
shall
we
poor
human
beings
at
such
a
disadvantage
from
the
first
in
the
fight
with
fate
through
the
many
weaknesses
and
ailments
of
our
bodies
load
our
souls
as
well
with
an
burden
of
regret
and
penitence
shall
we
let
a
weight
of
vivid
memories
break
our
hearts
how
are
we
to
get
on
with
our
living
if
we
are
continually
dropping
into
sloughs
of
bitter
and
often
unjust
every
morning
comes
the
light
and
a
fresh
chance
of
doing
better
is
it
not
the
sheerest
folly
and
ingratitude
to
let
yesterday
spoil
the
there
had
been
a
heavy
dew
and
the
moss
along
the
wayside
was
soaked
with
it
and
the
leaves
of
the
slender
young
beeches
sparkled
with
it
and
the
bracken
bending
over
the
path
on
either
side
left
its
wetness
on
my
dress
as
i
passed
nowhere
was
there
a
single
bit
of
gloom
where
you
could
sit
down
and
be
wretched
the
very
jays
would
have
laughed
you
out
of
countenance
if
you
had
sat
there
looking
sorrowful
sometimes
the
path
was
narrow
and
the
trees
shut
out
the
sky
sometimes
it
led
me
into
the
hot
sunshine
of
an
open
space
once
it
took
me
along
the
side
of
a
meadow
sloping
up
on
its
distant
side
to
more
forest
with
only
a
single
row
of
great
beeches
between
me
and
the
heat
and
light
dancing
over
the
grass
and
all
the
way
i
had
squirrels
for
company
chattering
and
enjoying
themselves
as
sensible
squirrels
living
only
in
the
present
do
and
larks
over
my
head
singing
in
careless
ecstasy
just
because
they
had
no
idea
they
were
probably
bad
larks
with
pasts
and
lizards
down
at
my
feet
motionless
in
the
hot
sun
quite
unaware
of
how
wicked
it
becomes
to
lie
in
the
sun
doing
nothing
directly
you
wear
clothes
and
have
consciences
as
for
the
scent
of
the
forest
he
who
has
been
in
it
early
after
a
dewy
night
knows
that
and
the
effect
it
has
on
the
spirits
of
him
who
smells
it
so
i
need
not
explain
how
happy
i
was
and
how
invigorated
as
i
climbed
up
a
long
hill
where
the
wood
was
thick
and
cool
and
coming
out
at
the
top
found
i
had
reached
a
place
of
turf
and
sunshine
with
tables
in
the
shade
at
the
farther
side
and
in
the
middle
in
hand
a
waiter
this
waiter
came
as
a
shock
my
thoughts
had
wandered
quite
into
the
opposite
channel
to
the
one
that
ends
in
waiters
there
he
stood
however
solitary
and
suggestive
in
the
middle
of
the
sunny
green
a
crumpled
waiter
in
regard
to
and
not
a
waiter
i
should
say
of
more
than
washings
but
his
eye
was
persuasive
steam
came
out
of
the
spout
of
his
and
out
of
his
mouth
as
i
walked
towards
him
issued
appropriate
words
about
the
weather
i
had
meant
to
go
back
to
breakfast
with
charlotte
and
there
was
no
reason
at
all
why
i
should
cross
the
green
and
walk
straight
up
to
the
waiter
but
there
was
that
in
his
eye
which
made
me
feel
that
if
i
did
not
drink
his
coffee
not
only
had
i
no
business
on
the
top
of
the
hill
but
i
was
unspeakably
base
besides
so
i
sat
down
at
one
of
the
tables
beneath
the
beeches
there
were
at
least
twelve
tables
and
only
one
other
visitor
a
man
in
spectacles
and
the
waiter
produced
a
tablecloth
that
made
me
shiver
and
poured
me
out
a
cup
of
coffee
and
brought
me
a
roll
of
immense
resistance
one
of
yesterday
i
imagined
the
roll
cart
from
binz
not
having
had
time
yet
to
get
up
the
hill
he
fetched
this
roll
from
a
pretty
house
with
latticed
windows
standing
on
the
side
of
the
green
and
he
fixed
me
with
his
hungry
eye
and
told
me
the
house
was
an
inn
and
that
it
was
not
only
ready
but
anxious
to
take
me
as
a
lodger
for
any
period
i
might
choose
i
excused
myself
on
the
plea
of
its
distance
from
the
water
he
said
that
precisely
this
distance
was
its
charm
lady
he
continued
with
a
wave
of
his
that
immediately
caused
a
thin
streak
of
steam
to
rise
from
the
grass
lady
can
see
for
herself
how
idyllic
is
the
situation
the
lady
murmured
assent
and
in
order
to
avoid
his
hungry
eye
busied
herself
dividing
her
roll
among
some
expectant
fowls
who
plainly
used
to
the
business
were
crowding
round
her
so
that
the
roll
staleness
perhaps
intentional
ended
by
being
entirely
to
the
good
of
the
inn
by
the
time
the
fowls
were
ready
for
more
the
waiter
who
had
nothing
pressing
on
hand
had
become
a
nuisance
too
great
to
be
borne
i
would
have
liked
to
sit
there
and
rest
in
the
shade
watching
the
clouds
slowly
appear
above
the
opposite
and
sail
over
my
head
and
out
of
sight
but
i
could
not
because
of
the
waiter
so
i
paid
him
got
up
once
more
firmly
declined
either
to
take
or
look
at
rooms
at
the
inn
and
wished
him
a
good
morning
instinct
with
dignity
and
chill
lady
will
now
of
course
visit
the
jagdschloss
said
the
waiter
whipping
out
a
bundle
of
tickets
of
admission
jagdschloss
i
repeated
and
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
i
saw
a
building
through
the
trees
just
behind
where
i
had
been
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
sharp
ascent
so
that
was
where
my
walk
had
led
me
to
the
devotes
several
animated
pages
to
this
jagdschloss
or
shooting
lodge
it
belongs
to
prince
putbus
its
round
tower
rising
out
of
a
green
sea
of
wood
was
a
landmark
with
which
i
had
soon
grown
familiar
whenever
you
climb
up
a
hill
in
rügen
to
see
the
view
you
see
the
jagdschloss
whichever
way
you
drive
it
is
always
the
central
feature
of
the
landscape
if
it
is
anywhere
else
it
is
sure
to
be
on
the
horizon
only
in
some
northern
parts
of
the
island
does
one
get
away
from
it
and
even
there
probably
a
telescope
used
with
skill
would
produce
it
at
once
and
here
i
was
beneath
its
walls
well
i
had
not
intended
going
over
it
and
all
i
wanted
at
that
moment
was
to
get
rid
of
the
waiter
and
go
on
with
my
walk
but
it
was
easier
to
take
a
ticket
than
to
refuse
and
hear
him
exclaim
and
protest
so
i
paid
fifty
was
given
a
slip
of
paper
and
started
climbing
the
extremely
steep
ascent
the
site
was
obviously
chosen
without
the
least
reference
to
the
legs
or
lungs
of
tourists
they
arrive
at
the
top
warm
and
speechless
and
sinking
down
on
the
steps
between
two
wolves
made
of
copper
the
first
thing
they
do
is
to
spend
several
minutes
gasping
then
they
ring
a
bell
give
up
their
tickets
and
umbrellas
and
are
taken
round
in
batches
by
an
elderly
person
who
manifestly
thinks
them
poor
things
when
i
got
to
the
top
i
found
the
other
visitor
the
man
in
spectacles
sitting
on
the
steps
getting
his
gasping
done
having
finished
mine
before
him
he
being
a
man
of
bulk
i
rang
the
bell
the
elderly
official
who
had
a
singular
talent
for
making
one
feel
by
a
mere
look
what
a
worm
one
really
is
appeared
can
not
take
each
of
you
round
separately
he
said
pointing
at
the
man
still
fighting
for
air
on
the
bottom
step
does
your
husband
not
intend
to
see
the
schloss
husband
i
echoed
astonished
sir
he
continued
impatiently
addressing
the
back
below
you
coming
or
not
the
man
in
spectacles
made
a
great
effort
caught
hold
of
the
convenient
leg
of
one
of
the
copper
wolves
pulled
himself
on
to
his
feet
with
its
aid
and
climbed
slowly
up
the
steps
public
is
requested
not
to
touch
the
objects
of
art
snapped
the
custodian
glancing
at
the
wolf
leg
to
see
if
it
had
suffered
the
man
in
spectacles
looked
properly
ashamed
of
his
conduct
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
too
but
only
on
the
more
general
grounds
of
being
such
a
worm
and
together
we
silently
followed
the
guide
into
the
house
together
gave
up
our
tickets
and
together
laid
our
stick
and
sunshade
side
by
side
on
a
table
a
number
was
given
to
the
man
in
spectacles
my
number
i
inquired
politely
one
suffices
said
the
guide
eyeing
me
with
disapproval
for
taking
me
for
the
wife
of
the
man
in
spectacles
he
regarded
my
desire
to
have
a
number
all
to
myself
as
only
one
more
instance
of
the
lengths
to
which
the
modern
woman
in
her
struggle
for
emancipation
will
go
the
stick
and
sunshade
were
accordingly
tied
together
you
wish
to
ascend
the
tower
he
asked
my
companion
showing
us
the
iron
staircase
winding
round
and
round
inside
the
tower
up
to
the
top
du
allmächtiger
nein
was
the
hasty
reply
after
a
glance
and
a
shudder
taking
for
granted
that
without
my
husband
i
would
not
want
to
go
up
towers
he
did
not
ask
me
but
at
once
led
the
way
through
a
very
charming
hall
decorated
with
what
are
known
as
trophies
of
the
chase
to
a
locked
door
before
which
stood
a
row
of
enormous
grey
felt
slippers
public
is
not
allowed
to
enter
the
princely
apartments
unless
it
has
previously
drawn
these
slippers
over
its
boots
said
the
guide
as
though
he
were
quoting
of
them
i
asked
faintly
facetious
again
he
eyed
me
but
this
time
in
silence
the
man
in
spectacles
thrust
his
feet
into
the
nearest
pair
they
were
generously
roomy
even
for
him
and
he
was
a
big
man
with
boots
to
match
i
looked
down
the
row
hoping
to
see
something
smaller
and
perhaps
newer
but
they
were
all
the
same
size
and
all
had
been
worn
repeatedly
by
other
tourists
next
time
i
come
to
the
jagdschloss
i
observed
thoughtfully
as
i
saw
my
feet
disappear
into
the
gaping
mouths
of
two
of
these
woolly
monsters
shall
bring
my
own
slippers
this
arrangement
may
be
useful
but
no
one
could
call
it
select
neither
of
my
companions
took
the
least
notice
of
me
the
guide
looked
disgusted
judging
from
his
face
though
he
still
thought
me
a
worm
he
now
suspected
me
of
belonging
to
that
highly
objectionable
class
known
as
turned
having
seen
us
safely
into
our
slippers
he
was
about
to
unlock
the
door
when
the
bell
rang
he
left
us
standing
mute
before
the
shut
door
and
leaning
over
the
balustrade
for
reader
as
charlotte
brontë
would
say
he
had
come
upstairs
he
called
down
to
the
fräulein
who
had
taken
our
stick
and
sunshade
to
let
in
the
visitors
she
did
so
and
as
she
flung
open
the
door
i
saw
through
the
pillars
of
the
balustrade
brosy
on
the
threshold
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
leaning
against
one
of
the
copper
wolves
her
arm
indeed
flung
over
its
valuable
shoulder
the
bishop
wife
gasping
at
this
sight
the
custodian
rushed
downstairs
the
man
in
spectacles
and
myself
mute
meek
and
motionless
in
our
felt
slippers
held
our
breaths
public
is
requested
not
to
touch
the
objects
of

shouted
the
custodian
as
he
rushed
he
speaking
to
me

asked
looking
up
at
her
son
think
he
is
mother
said
ambrose
do
think
you
may
lean
on
that
wolf
said
his
mother
in
surprise
standing
upright
and
examining
the
animal
through
her
eyeglasses
with
interest
it
is
i
thought
they
were
prussian
eagles
you
must
touch
it
mother
said
ambrose
a
slight
impatience
in
his
voice
says
the
public
are
not
to
touch
things
he
really
call
me
the
public
do
you
think
he
is
a
rude
person

the
lady

see
the

interrupted
the
custodian
have
another
party
inside
waiting
on
mother
you
want
to
do
you
but
not
if
he
a
rude
man
dear
said
slowly
ascending
the
steps
you
had
better
tell
him
who
father

do
think
it
would
impress
him
much
said
brosy
smiling
come
here
too
often
for
that
yes
but
not
bishops
said
his
mother
coming
into
the
echoing
hall
through
whose
emptiness
her
last
words
rang
like
a
trumpet
would
know
what
a
bishop
is
they
do
have
them
bishops
exclaimed
his
mother
stopping
short
and
staring
at
her
son
with
a
face
of
concern
um
die
interrupted
the
custodian
slamming
the
door
and
he
pulled
the
tickets
out
of
brosy
hand
bishops
continued
no
early
fathers
as
that
person
that
cousin
of
frau
nieberlein
told
us
last
night
my
dear
brosy
what
a
very
strange
state
of
things
do
think
she
quite
said
that
did
she
they
have
early
fathers
right
enough
she
did
understand
what
you
meant
and
umbrella
please
interrupted
the
custodian
snatching
them
out
of
their
passive
hands
the
number
please
now
this
way
please
he
hurried
or
tried
to
hurry
them
under
the
tower
but
the
wife
had
not
hurried
for
years
and
would
not
have
dreamed
of
doing
so
and
when
he
had
got
them
under
it
he
asked
if
they
wished
to
make
the
ascent
they
looked
up
shuddered
and
declined
we
will
at
once
join
the
other
party
said
the
custodian
bustling
on
other
party
exclaimed
in
german
i
hope
no
objectionable
tourists
i
quite
thought
coming
so
early
we
would
avoid
them
two
said
the
custodian
respectable
gentleman
and
his
wife
the
man
in
spectacles
and
i
up
to
then
mute
meek
and
motionless
in
our
grey
slippers
started
simultaneously
i
looked
at
him
cautiously
out
of
the
corners
of
my
eyes
and
found
to
my
confusion
that
he
was
looking
at
me
cautiously
out
of
the
corners
of
his
in
another
moment
the
stood
before
us
after
one
slight
look
of
faintest
surprise
at
my
companion
the
pleasant
ambrose
greeted
me
as
though
i
were
an
old
friend
and
then
bowing
with
a
politeness
acquired
during
his
long
stay
in
the
fatherland
to
the
person
he
supposed
was
my
husband
introduced
himself
in
german
fashion
by
mentioning
his
name
and
observed
that
he
was
exceedingly
pleased
to
make
his
acquaintance
freut
mich
sehr
ihre
bekanntschaft
zu
machen
said
the
pleasant
ambrose
gleichfalls
murmured
the
man
in
spectacles
bowing
repeatedly
and
obviously
astonished
to
the
bishop
wife
he
also
made
rapid
and
bewildered
bows
until
he
saw
she
was
gazing
over
his
head
and
then
he
stopped
she
had
recognised
my
presence
by
the
merest
shadow
of
a
nod
which
i
returned
with
an
indifference
that
was
icy
but
oddly
enough
what
offended
me
more
than
her
nod
was
the
glance
she
had
bestowed
on
the
man
in
spectacles
before
she
began
to
gaze
over
his
head
he
certainly
did
not
belong
to
me
and
yet
i
was
offended
this
seemed
to
me
so
subtle
that
it
set
me
off
pondering
public
is
not
allowed
to
enter
the
princely
apartments
unless
it
has
previously
drawn
these
slippers
over
its
boots
said
the
custodian
looked
at
him
critically
has
a
very
crude
way
of
expressing
himself
has
he
dear
she
remarked
to
ambrose
is
only
quoting
official
regulations
he
must
you
know
mother
and
we
are
undoubtedly
the
public
ambrose
looked
at
my
feet
then
at
the
feet
of
my
companion
and
then
without
more
ado
got
into
a
pair
of
slippers
he
wore
knickerbockers
and
stockings
and
his
legs
had
a
classic
refinement
that
erred
if
at
all
on
the
side
of
the
effect
of
the
enormous
grey
slippers
at
the
end
of
these
attic
legs
made
me
for
one
awful
moment
feel
as
though
i
were
going
to
shriek
with
laughter
an
immense
effort
strangled
the
shriek
and
left
me
unnaturally
solemn
had
now
caught
sight
of
the
row
of
slippers
she
put
up
her
eyeglasses
and
examined
them
carefully
very
german
she
remarked
them
on
mother
said
ambrose
are
all
waiting
for
you
they
new
brosy
she
asked
hesitating
lady
must
put
on
the
slippers
or
she
can
not
enter
the
princely
apartments
said
the
custodian
severely
i
really
brosy
she
inquired
looking
extremely
unhappy
am
so
terribly
afraid
of
infection
or
or
other
things
do
they
think
we
shall
spoil
their
carpets
floors
are
polished
i
imagine
said
ambrose
the
owner
is
probably
afraid
the
visitors
might
slip
and
hurt
themselves
quite
nice
and
considerate
of
him
if
only
they
were
new
ambrose
shuffled
to
the
end
of
the
row
in
his
and
took
up
two
look
here
mother
he
said
bringing
them
to
her
quite
a
new
pair
never
been
worn
before
put
them
on
they
ca
possibly
do
any
harm
they
were
not
new
but
thought
they
were
and
consented
to
put
them
on
the
instant
they
were
on
her
feet
stretching
out
in
all
their
hugeness
far
beyond
the
frills
of
her
skirt
and
obliging
her
to
slide
instead
of
walk
she
became
gracious
the
smile
with
which
she
slid
past
me
was
amiable
as
well
as
deprecatory
they
had
apparently
reduced
her
at
once
to
the
level
of
other
sinful
mortals
this
effect
seemed
to
me
so
subtle
that
again
i
fell
nieberlein
is
not
with
you
this
morning
she
asked
pleasantly
as
we
shuffled
side
by
side
into
the
princely
apartments
is
resting
she
had
rather
a
bad
night
of
course
ghosts
the
same
thing
said
ambrose
it
not
sir
he
asked
amiably
of
the
man
in
spectacles
said
the
man
in
spectacles
cautiously
not
a
real
ghost
asked
interested
believe
the
great
point
about
a
ghost
is
that
it
never
is
real
bishop
does
believe
in
them
either
but
i
i
really
hardly
know
one
hears
such
strange
tales
the
wife
of
one
of
the
clergy
of
our
diocese
believes
quite
firmly
in
them
she
is
a
vegetarian
and
of
course
she
eats
a
great
many
vegetables
and
then
she
sees
ghosts
said
the
guide
constructed
entirely
of
roman
marble
said
examining
it
abstractedly
through
her
eyeglasses
declares
their
vicarage
is
haunted
and
what
in
the
world
do
you
think
by
the
strangest
thing
it
is
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
cat
statue
on
the
right
is
by
thorwaldsen
said
the
guide
the
ghost
of
a
cat
repeated
impressively
she
seemed
to
expect
me
to
say
something
so
i
said
indeed
on
the
left
is
by
rauch
said
the
guide
this
cat
does
not
do
anything
i
mean
it
is
not
prophetic
of
impending
family
disaster
it
simply
walks
across
a
certain
room
the
i
believe
quite
like
a
real
cat
and
nothing
happens
perhaps
it
is
a
real
cat
no
it
is
supernatural
no
one
sees
it
but
herself
it
walks
quite
slowly
with
its
tail
up
in
the
air
and
once
when
she
went
up
to
it
to
try
to
pull
its
tail
so
as
to
convince
herself
of
its
existence
she
only
clutched
empty
air
frescoes
with
which
this
apartment
is
adorned
are
by
kolbe
and
eybel
said
the
guide
mean
it
ran
away
it
walked
on
quite
deliberately
but
the
tail
not
being
made
of
human
flesh
and
blood
there
was
naturally
nothing
to
pull
from
left
to
right
we
have
in
the
first
a
representation
of
the
entry
of
king
waldemar
into
rügen
said
the
guide
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
it
happened
one
day
when
she
put
a
saucer
of
cream
on
the
floor
for
it
she
had
thought
it
all
over
in
the
night
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
as
no
ghost
would
lap
cream
and
no
real
cat
be
able
to
help
lapping
it
this
would
provide
her
with
a
decisive
proof
one
way
or
the
other
the
cat
came
saw
the
cream
and
immediately
lapped
it
up
my
friend
was
so
pleased
because
of
course
one
likes
real
cats
best
second
represents
the
introduction
of
christianity
into
the
island
said
the
and
when
it
had
done
and
the
saucer
was
empty
she
went
over
to
it
third
represents
the
laying
of
the
foundation
stone
of
the
church
at
vilmnitz
said
the
and
what
do
you
think
happened
walked
straight
through
what
i
asked
profoundly
interested
cream
or
the
cat
that
was
what
was
so
marvellous
she
walked
right
through
the
body
of
the
cat
now
what
had
become
of
the
cream
i
confess
this
story
impressed
me
more
than
any
ghost
story
i
have
ever
heard
the
disappearance
of
the
cream
was
so
extraordinary
there
was
nothing
nothing
at
all
left
on
her
dress
i
asked
eagerly
mean
after
walking
through
the
cat
one
would
have
thought
that
some
at
least
of
the
cream
a
vestige
i
stood
gazing
at
the
bishop
wife
absorbed
in
reflection
truly
strange
i
murmured
at
length
after
having
vainly
endeavoured
to
account
for
the
missing
cream
it
said
much
pleased
with
the
effect
of
her
story
indeed
the
amiability
awakened
in
her
bosom
by
the
grey
felt
slippers
had
increased
rapidly
and
the
unaccountable
conduct
of
the
cream
seemed
about
to
cement
our
friendship
when
at
this
point
she
having
remarked
that
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
our
philosophy
and
i
in
order
to
show
my
acquaintance
with
the
classics
of
other
countries
having
added
chaucer
justly
observes
to
which
she
said
yes
so
beautiful
is
he
a
voice
behind
us
made
us
both
jump
and
turning
round
we
beheld
at
our
elbows
the
man
in
spectacles
ambrose
aided
by
the
guide
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
studying
the
works
of
kolbe
and
eybel
the
man
in
spectacles
had
evidently
heard
the
whole
story
of
the
cat
for
this
is
what
he
said
apparition
madam
if
it
has
any
meaning
at
all
which
i
doubt
being
myself
inclined
to
locate
its
origin
in
the
faulty
digestion
of
the
lady
seems
to
point
to
a
life
beyond
the
grave
for
the
spirits
of
cats
considered
as
a
proof
of
such
a
life
for
the
human
soul
which
is
the
one
claim
to
our
interest
phenomena
of
the
kind
can
possess
it
is
of
course
valueless
stared
at
him
a
moment
through
her
eyeglasses
she
then
said
distantly
no
further
proof
of
that
i
ask
madam
what
precisely
you
mean
by
christians
inquired
the
man
in
spectacles
briskly
them
if
you
please
now
the
bishop
wife
was
not
used
to
being
asked
to
define
things
and
disliked
it
as
much
as
anybody
else
besides
though
rays
of
intelligent
interest
darted
through
his
spectacles
the
wearer
of
them
also
wore
clothes
that
were
not
only
old
but
peculiar
and
his
whole
appearance
cried
aloud
of
much
work
and
small
reward
she
therefore
looked
not
only
helpless
but
indignant
she
said
icily
is
not
the
moment
to
define
christians
hear
the
name
repeatedly
said
the
man
in
spectacles
bowing
but
undaunted
looking
round
me
i
ask
myself
where
are
they
said
are
in
every
christian
country
which
pray
madam
would
you
call
the
christian
countries
i
look
around
me
and
i
see
nations
armed
to
the
teeth
ready
and
sometimes
even
anxious
to
fly
at
each
other
throats
their
attitude
may
be
patriotic
virile
perhaps
necessary
conceivably
estimable
but
madam
would
you
call
it
christian
said
noticed
by
your
accent
madam
that
the
excellent
german
you
speak
was
not
originally
acquired
in
our
fatherland
but
must
be
the
result
of
a
commendable
diligence
practised
in
the
schoolrooms
of
your
youth
and
native
land
and
having
further
observed
from
certain
unmistakable
signs
that
the
native
land
in
question
must
be
england
it
would
have
a
peculiar
interest
for
me
to
be
favoured
with
the
exact
meaning
the
inhabitants
of
that
enlightened
country
attach
to
the
term
my
income
having
hitherto
not
been
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
visit
its
hospitable
shores
i
hail
this
opportunity
with
pleasure
of
discussing
questions
that
are
of
importance
to
us
all
with
one
of
its
no
doubt
most
distinguished
daughters
said
first
sight
went
on
the
man
in
spectacles
would
be
disposed
to
say
that
a
christian
is
a
person
who
believes
in
the
tenets
of
the
christian
faith
but
belief
if
it
is
genuine
must
necessarily
find
its
practical
expression
in
works
how
then
madam
would
you
account
for
the
fact
that
when
i
look
round
me
in
the
provincial
town
in
which
i
pursue
the
honourable
calling
of
a
pedagogue
i
see
numerous
christians
but
no
works
i
do
not
account
for
it
said
angrily
consider
madam
the
lively
faith
inspired
by
other
creeds
place
against
this
inertia
the
activity
of
other
believers
observe
the
dervish
how
he
dances
observe
the
fakir
hanging
from
his
hook
will
not
sir
said
roused
now
beyond
endurance
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
choose
this
place
and
time
to
thrust
your
opinions
on
sacred
subjects
on
a
stranger
and
a
lady
with
which
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
shuffled
away
with
all
the
dignity
the
felt
slippers
allowed
the
man
in
spectacles
stood
confounded
lady
i
said
desirous
of
applying
balm
the
wife
of
a
clergyman
heavens
if
she
had
heard
me
is
therefore
afraid
of
talking
about
things
that
must
lead
her
on
to
sacred
ground
i
think
you
will
find
the
son
very
intelligent
and
ready
to
talk
but
i
regret
to
say
the
man
in
spectacles
seemed
extremely
shy
of
me
whether
it
was
because
the
custodian
had
taken
me
for
his
wife
or
because
i
was
an
apparently
unattached
female
wandering
about
and
drinking
coffee
by
myself
contrary
to
all
decent
custom
i
do
not
know
anyhow
he
met
my
attempt
to
explain
to
him
with
suspicion
and
murmuring
something
about
the
english
being
indeed
very
strangely
mannered
he
edged
cautiously
away
we
now
straggled
through
the
rooms
separately
ambrose
in
front
with
the
guide
his
mother
by
herself
i
by
myself
and
a
good
way
behind
us
the
mortified
man
in
spectacles
he
made
no
effort
to
take
my
advice
and
talk
to
ambrose
but
kept
carefully
as
far
away
from
the
rest
of
us
as
possible
and
when
we
presently
found
ourselves
once
more
outside
the
princely
apartments
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
door
by
which
we
had
gone
into
them
he
slid
forward
shook
off
his
felt
slippers
with
the
finality
of
one
who
shakes
off
dust
from
his
feet
made
three
rapid
bows
one
to
each
of
us
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
arrived
at
the
bottom
we
saw
him
take
his
stick
from
the
fräulein
shake
his
head
with
indignant
vigour
when
she
tried
to
make
him
take
my
sunshade
too
pull
open
the
heavy
door
and
almost
run
through
it
he
slammed
it
with
an
energy
that
made
the
jagdschloss
tremble
the
fräulein
looked
first
at
the
slammed
door
then
at
the
sunshade
and
then
up
at
me
said
the
fräulein
look
as
plainly
as
speech
ambrose
looked
at
me
too
and
in
his
eyes
was
an
interrogation
looked
at
me
too
and
in
her
eyes
was
coldest
condemnation
it
possible
said
eyes
any
one
can
really
marry
such
a
person
as
for
me
i
walked
downstairs
my
face
bland
with
innocence
and
unconcern
delightful
i
said
enthusiastically
truly
delightful
these
walls
look
with
all
the
antlers
and
things
on
them
said
ambrose
was
silent
probably
she
had
resolved
never
to
speak
to
me
again
but
when
we
were
at
the
bottom
and
ambrose
was
bestowing
fees
on
the
fräulein
and
the
custodian
she
said
did
not
know
your
husband
was
travelling
with
you
husband
i
repeated
inquiringly
he
is
he
at
home
minding
i
hope
my
neglected
children
home
then
who
then
whose
husband
was
that
what
i
asked
following
her
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
door
so
lately
slammed
that
man
in
spectacles
how
can
i
tell
perhaps
nobody
certainly
not
mine
stared
at
me
in
immense
surprise
very
extraordinary
she
said
the
sixth
day
the
granitz
woods
schwarzer
see
and
kieköwer
in
the
woods
behind
binz
alone
in
the
heart
of
them
near
a
clearing
where
in
past
days
somebody
must
have
lived
for
ancient
fruit
trees
still
mark
the
place
that
used
to
be
a
garden
there
is
a
single
grave
on
which
the
dead
beech
leaves
slowly
dropping
down
through
the
days
and
nights
of
many
autumns
have
heaped
a
sober
cover
on
the
headstone
is
a
rusty
iron
plate
with
this
inscription
hier
ruht
ein
finnischer
krieger
there
is
no
fence
round
it
and
no
name
on
it
every
autumn
the
beech
leaves
make
the
unknown
soldier
a
new
brown
pall
and
through
the
sparkling
frozen
winters
except
for
the
thin
shadows
of
naked
branches
he
lies
in
sunshine
in
the
spring
the
blue
hepaticas
children
of
those
that
were
there
the
first
day
gather
about
his
sodden
mound
in
little
flocks
of
loveliness
then
after
a
warm
rain
the
shadows
broaden
and
draw
together
for
overhead
the
leaves
are
bursting
the
wind
blowing
on
to
him
from
the
clearing
is
scented
for
the
grass
out
there
has
violets
in
it
the
pear
trees
in
the
deserted
garden
put
on
their
white
robes
of
promise
and
then
comes
summer
and
in
the
long
days
there
are
wanderers
in
the
woods
and
the
chance
moved
perhaps
by
some
vague
sentiment
of
pity
for
so
much
loneliness
throws
him
a
few
flowers
or
a
bunch
of
ferns
as
he
goes
his
way
there
was
a
cross
of
bracken
lying
on
the
grave
when
i
came
upon
it
still
fresh
and
tied
together
with
bits
of
grass
and
a
wreath
of
hung
round
the
headstone
sitting
down
by
the
side
of
the
nameless
one
to
rest
for
the
sun
was
high
and
i
began
to
be
tired
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
leaned
my
face
against
his
cool
covering
of
leaves
still
wet
with
the
last
rain
that
he
was
very
cosily
tucked
away
down
there
away
from
worries
and
the
chill
fingers
of
fear
with
everything
over
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
each
of
the
hours
destined
for
him
in
which
hard
things
were
to
happen
lived
through
and
done
with
a
curiosity
to
know
how
he
came
to
be
in
the
granitz
woods
at
a
time
when
rügen
belonging
to
the
french
had
nothing
to
do
with
finland
made
me
pull
out
my
but
it
was
blank
the
whole
time
i
was
journeying
round
rügen
it
was
invariably
blank
when
it
ought
to
have
been
illuminating
what
had
this
man
done
or
left
undone
that
he
should
have
been
shut
out
from
the
company
of
those
who
are
buried
in
churchyards
why
should
he
because
he
was
nameless
be
outcast
as
well
why
should
his
body
be
held
unworthy
of
a
place
by
the
side
of
persons
who
though
they
were
as
dead
as
himself
still
went
on
being
respectable
i
took
off
my
hat
and
leaned
against
the
finnish
warrior
grave
and
stared
up
along
the
smooth
beech
trunks
to
the
point
where
the
leaves
getting
out
of
the
shade
flashed
in
the
sun
at
the
top
and
marvelled
greatly
at
the
ways
of
men
who
pursue
each
other
with
conventions
and
disapproval
even
when
their
object
ceasing
to
be
a
man
is
nothing
but
a
poor
unresentful
indifferent
corpse
it
is
certainly
with
me
it
is
a
symptom
of
fatigue
and
want
of
food
to
marvel
at
the
ways
of
men
my
spirit
grows
more
and
more
inclined
to
carp
as
my
body
grows
more
tired
and
hungry
when
i
am
not
too
weary
and
have
not
given
my
breakfast
to
fowls
my
thoughts
have
a
cheerful
way
of
fixing
themselves
entirely
on
the
happy
side
of
things
and
life
seems
extraordinarily
charming
but
i
see
nothing
happy
and
my
soul
is
lost
in
blackness
if
for
many
hours
i
have
had
no
food
how
useless
to
talk
to
a
person
of
the
charities
if
you
have
not
first
fed
him
how
useless
to
explain
that
they
are
scattered
at
his
feet
like
flowers
if
you
have
fed
him
too
much
both
these
states
of
being
and
not
fed
enough
are
equally
fatal
to
the
exquisitely
sensitive
life
of
the
soul
and
so
it
came
about
that
because
it
was
long
past
and
i
had
walked
far
and
it
was
hot
i
found
myself
growing
sentimental
over
the
poor
dead
finn
inclined
to
envy
him
because
he
could
go
on
resting
there
while
i
had
to
find
a
way
back
to
binz
in
the
heat
and
excuse
my
absence
to
an
offended
cousin
launching
indignant
at
his
having
been
denied
christian
burial
into
a
whole
sea
of
woful
reflections
on
the
spites
and
follies
of
mankind
from
which
a
single
piece
of
bread
would
have
rescued
me
and
as
i
was
very
tired
and
it
was
very
hot
and
very
silent
and
very
drowsy
my
grumblings
and
disapprovals
grew
gradually
vaguer
grew
milder
grew
confused
grew
intermittent
and
i
went
to
sleep
now
to
go
to
sleep
out
of
doors
on
a
fine
summer
afternoon
is
an
extremely
pleasant
thing
to
do
if
nobody
comes
and
looks
at
you
and
you
are
comfortable
i
was
not
exactly
comfortable
for
the
ground
round
the
grave
was
mossless
and
hard
and
when
the
wind
caught
it
the
bracken
cross
tickled
my
ear
and
jerked
my
mind
dismally
on
to
earwigs
also
some
spiders
with
frail
long
legs
which
they
seemed
to
leave
lying
about
at
the
least
and
gentlest
attempt
to
persuade
them
to
go
away
walked
about
on
me
and
would
not
walk
anywhere
else
but
presently
i
left
off
feeling
them
or
caring
and
sank
away
deliciously
into
dreams
the
last
thing
i
heard
being
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
the
last
thing
i
felt
the
cool
wind
lifting
my
hair
and
now
the
truly
literary
if
he
did
not
here
digress
into
a
description
of
what
he
dreamed
which
is
a
form
of
digression
skipped
by
the
truly
judicious
would
certainly
write
long
i
had
slept
i
know
not
and
would
then
tell
the
reader
that
waking
with
a
start
he
immediately
proceeded
to
shiver
i
can
not
do
better
than
imitate
him
leaving
out
the
start
and
the
shiver
since
i
did
neither
and
altering
his
method
to
suit
my
greater
homeliness
remark
that
i
do
know
how
long
i
had
been
asleep
because
i
had
not
looked
at
a
watch
when
i
began
but
opening
my
eyes
in
due
season
i
found
that
they
stared
straight
into
the
eyes
of
and
that
she
and
brosy
were
standing
side
by
side
looking
down
at
me
being
a
woman
my
first
thought
was
a
fervent
hope
that
i
had
not
been
sleeping
with
my
mouth
wide
open
being
a
human
creature
torn
by
ungovernable
passions
my
second
was
to
cry
out
inwardly
and
historically
no
one
rid
me
of
this
troublesome
prelatess
then
i
sat
up
and
feverishly
patted
my
hair
am
not
in
the
i
said
with
some
asperity
came
to
look
at
the
grave
smilingly
answered
i
help
you
up
asked
ambrose
no
fetch
me
my
out
of
the
fly
i
will
sit
here
a
few
minutes
with
frau
x
you
were
having
a
little
nap
she
added
turning
to
me
still
smiling
you
have
been
in
the
woods
ever
since
we
parted
this
morning
at
the
jagdschloss
brosy
she
called
after
him
the
out
as
well
my
dear
frau
you
must
be
absolutely
faint
do
you
not
think
it
injudicious
to
go
so
many
hours
without
nourishment
we
will
make
tea
now
instead
of
a
little
later
and
i
insist
on
your
eating
something
really
this
was
very
obliging
what
had
happened
to
the
bishop
wife
her
urbanity
was
so
marked
that
i
thought
it
could
only
be
a
beautiful
dream
and
i
rubbed
my
eyes
before
answering
but
it
was
undoubtedly
she
had
been
home
since
i
saw
her
last
rested
lunched
put
on
fresh
garments
perhaps
bathed
but
all
these
things
soothing
as
they
are
could
not
by
themselves
account
for
the
change
also
she
spoke
to
me
in
english
for
the
first
time
are
very
kind
i
murmured
staring
imagine
she
said
to
ambrose
who
approached
across
the
crackling
leaves
with
the
and
cushions
from
the
seats
of
the
fly
waiting
in
the
forest
road
a
few
yards
away
little
lady
has
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
i
say
said
brosy
sympathetically
lady
i
repeated
to
myself
more
and
more
puzzled
you
must
lean
against
a
hard
grave
said
brosy
least
let
me
put
this
cushion
behind
your
back
and
i
can
make
you
much
more
comfortable
if
you
will
stand
up
a
moment
i
am
so
stiff
i
exclaimed
as
he
helped
me
up
must
have
been
here
hours
what
time
is
it
four
said
brosy
injudicious
said
his
mother
frau
you
must
promise
me
never
to
do
such
a
thing
again
what
would
happen
to
those
sweet
children
of
yours
if
their
little
mother
were
to
be
laid
up
dear
dear
me
what
was
all
this
sweet
children
little
mother
i
could
only
sit
on
my
cushions
and
stare
she
explained
noticing
i
suppose
that
i
looked
astonished
and
thinking
it
was
because
brosy
was
spreading
out
cups
and
lighting
the
so
very
close
to
the
deceased
finn
not
desecration
it
is
not
as
though
we
were
having
tea
in
a
churchyard
which
of
course
we
never
would
have
this
is
unconsecrated
ground
one
can
not
desecrate
that
which
has
never
been
consecrated
desecration
can
only
begin
after
consecration
has
taken
place
i
bowed
my
head
and
then
cheered
into
speech
by
the
sight
of
an
approaching
rusk
i
added
know
a
family
with
a
mausoleum
and
on
fine
days
they
go
and
have
coffee
at
it
of
course
said
smiling
but
with
an
effort
can
hardly
imagine
english
yes
germans
when
any
one
goes
to
see
them
if
it
is
fine
they
say
let
us
drink
coffee
at
the
mausoleum
and
then
they
do
it
a
special
treat
asked
brosy
view
there
is
very
lovely
i
see
said
relieved
only
sit
outside
i
was
afraid
for
a
moment
that
they
actually
no
i
said
eating
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
perfect
rusk
ever
produced
by
german
baker
actually
a
sweet
spot
this
is
to
be
buried
in
remarked
while
brosy
with
the
skill
of
one
used
to
doing
it
made
the
tea
and
then
according
to
the
wont
of
good
women
when
they
speak
of
being
buried
she
sighed
wonder
she
went
on
he
came
to
be
put
here
is
what
i
have
been
wondering
ever
since
i
found
him
i
said
was
wounded
in
some
battle
and
was
trying
to
get
home
said
brosy
know
finland
was
swedish
in
those
days
and
so
was
rügen
as
i
did
not
know
i
said
nothing
but
looked
exceedingly
bright
had
been
fighting
for
sweden
against
the
french
i
met
a
forester
yesterday
and
he
told
me
there
used
to
be
a
forester
house
where
those
fruit
trees
are
and
the
people
in
it
took
him
in
and
nursed
him
till
he
died
then
they
buried
him
here
why
was
he
not
buried
in
a
churchyard
asked
his
mother
do
know
poor
chap
i
do
suppose
he
would
have
cared
the
great
point
i
should
say
under
such
circumstances
would
be
the
being
dead
dear
brosy
murmured
his
mother
which
was
what
she
always
murmured
when
he
said
things
that
she
disapproved
without
quite
knowing
why
a
still
greater
point
i
remarked
moved
again
to
cheerful
speech
by
the
excellent
tea
brosy
had
made
and
his
mother
justly
suspicious
of
the
tea
of
teutons
had
smuggled
through
the
customs
as
she
afterwards
told
me
with
pride
still
greater
point
if
those
are
the
circumstances
that
lie
in
wait
for
one
would
be
the
never
being
born
but
that
is
pessimism
cried
shaking
a
finger
at
me
have
you
of
all
people
in
the
world
to
do
with
pessimism
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
have
my
days
like
everybody
else
i
said
slightly
puzzled
again
by
this
remark
i
was
told
of
two
aged
germans
i
continued
for
by
this
time
i
had
had
three
rusks
and
was
feeling
very
pleasant
two
aged
germans
whose
digestive
machinery
was
fragile
poor
things
said
sympathetically
in
spite
of
that
they
drank
beer
all
their
lives
persistently
and
excessively
very
injudicious
said
drank
such
a
fearful
lot
and
for
so
long
that
at
last
they
became
philosophers
dear
frau
said
incredulously
an
unexpected
result
but
indeed
there
is
hardly
anything
you
may
not
at
last
become
i
insisted
besides
being
german
your
diet
is
indiscreet
enough
i
quite
think
said
and
what
happened
asked
brosy
with
smiling
eyes
they
were
naturally
profoundly
pessimistic
both
of
them
you
are
you
know
if
your
diet
yes
yes
indeed
agreed
with
the
conviction
of
one
who
has
been
through
it
were
absolutely
sick
of
things
they
loathed
everything
anybody
said
or
did
and
they
were
disciples
of
nietzsche
that
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
the
excessive
asked
brosy
i
ca
nietzsche
cried
ever
read
him
brosy
i
saw
some
things
he
says
about
women
he
is
too
dreadful
one
said
to
the
other
over
their
despairing
potations
only
those
can
be
considered
truly
happy
who
are
destined
never
to
be
born
cried
is
nietzsche
all
over
pessimism
never
heard
ranker
said
brosy
smiling
the
other
thought
it
over
and
then
said
drearily
but
to
how
few
falls
that
happy
lot
there
was
a
pause
brosy
was
laughing
behind
his
teacup
his
mother
on
the
contrary
looked
solemn
and
gazed
at
me
thoughtfully
is
a
great
want
of
simple
faith
about
germans
she
said
bishop
thinks
it
so
sad
a
story
like
that
would
quite
upset
him
he
has
been
very
anxious
lest
brosy
our
only
child
dear
frau
so
you
may
imagine
how
precious
should
become
tainted
by
it
dislike
beer
said
brosy
man
this
morning
for
instance
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
it
he
was
just
the
type
of
man
quite
apart
from
his
insolence
that
most
grieves
the
bishop
i
said
and
wondered
respectfully
at
the
amount
of
grieving
the
bishop
got
through
educated
man
i
suppose
did
he
not
say
he
was
a
schoolmaster
a
teacher
of
the
young
without
a
vestige
himself
of
the
simple
faith
he
ought
to
inculcate
for
if
he
had
had
a
vestige
would
it
not
have
prevented
his
launching
into
an
irreverent
conversation
with
a
lady
who
was
not
only
a
stranger
but
the
wife
of
a
prelate
of
the
church
of
england
could
know
that
mother
said
brosy
from
what
you
told
me
it
was
a
conversation
he
launched
into
but
a
monologue
and
i
must
beg
your
pardon
he
added
turning
to
me
with
a
smile
the
absurd
mistake
we
made
it
was
the
guide
fault
yes
my
dear
frau
you
must
forgive
me
it
was
really
too
silly
of
me
i
might
have
known
i
was
completely
taken
aback
i
assure
you
but
the
guide
was
so
very
positive
and
there
followed
such
a
number
of
apologies
that
again
i
was
bewildered
only
retaining
the
one
clear
impression
that
the
bishop
wife
desired
exceedingly
to
be
agreeable
well
a
woman
bent
on
being
agreeable
is
better
than
a
woman
bent
on
being
disagreeable
though
being
the
soul
of
caution
in
my
statements
i
must
add
not
always
for
i
suppose
few
of
us
have
walked
any
distance
along
the
path
of
life
without
having
had
to
go
at
least
some
part
of
the
way
in
the
company
of
persons
who
filled
with
the
praiseworthy
wish
to
be
very
pleasant
succeeded
only
in
drenching
our
spirits
with
the
depressing
torrents
of
effusion
and
effusiveness
applied
to
myself
has
precisely
the
effect
of
a
finger
applied
to
the
horns
of
a
snail
who
shall
be
innocently
airing
himself
in
the
sun
he
gets
back
without
more
ado
into
his
shell
and
so
do
i
that
is
what
happened
on
this
occasion
for
some
reason
which
i
could
only
faintly
guess
the
bishop
wife
after
disapproving
of
me
in
the
morning
was
petting
me
in
the
afternoon
she
had
been
lunching
she
told
me
with
charlotte
and
they
had
had
a
nice
talk
she
said
about
me
about
me
instantly
i
scrambled
back
into
my
shell
there
is
surely
nothing
in
the
world
so
tiresome
as
being
questioned
as
i
now
was
on
one
household
arrangements
and
personal
habits
i
will
talk
about
anything
but
that
i
will
talk
with
the
courage
of
ignorance
about
all
high
matters
of
which
i
know
nothing
i
am
ready
to
discourse
on
all
or
any
of
the
great
abstractions
with
the
glibness
of
the
shallow
mind
i
will
listen
sympathetically
to
descriptions
of
diseases
suffered
and
operations
survived
of
the
brilliance
of
sons
and
the
beauty
of
daughters
i
will
lend
an
attentive
ear
to
an
enumeration
of
social
successes
and
family
difficulties
of
woes
and
triumphs
of
every
sort
including
those
connected
with
kitchens
but
i
will
not
answer
questions
about
myself
and
indeed
what
is
there
to
talk
about
no
one
is
interested
in
my
soul
and
as
for
my
body
i
long
ago
got
tired
of
that
one
can
not
however
eat
a
person
rusks
without
assuming
a
certain
amount
of
subsequent
blandness
so
i
did
my
best
to
behave
nicely
brosy
smoked
cigarettes
whatever
it
was
that
had
sent
me
up
in
his
estimation
had
apparently
sent
me
down
in
his
he
no
longer
it
seemed
looked
upon
me
as
a
good
specimen
of
the
intelligent
german
female
i
might
be
as
eloquently
silent
as
i
liked
and
it
did
not
impress
him
in
the
least
the
few
remarks
he
made
showed
me
that
this
was
grievous
for
brosy
was
in
person
a
very
charming
young
man
and
the
good
opinion
of
charming
young
men
is
quite
a
nice
thing
to
possess
now
i
began
to
regret
now
that
he
was
merely
interjectional
those
earnest
paragraphs
in
which
he
had
talked
the
night
before
at
supper
and
during
the
sunset
walk
on
the
island
of
vilm
observing
him
sideways
and
cautiously
i
saw
that
the
pretty
speeches
his
mother
was
making
me
of
everything
and
nothing
were
objectionable
to
him
and
i
silently
agreed
with
him
that
pretty
speeches
are
unpleasant
things
especially
when
made
by
one
woman
to
another
you
can
forgive
a
man
perhaps
because
in
your
heart
in
spite
of
all
experience
lurks
the
comfortable
belief
that
he
means
what
he
says
but
how
shall
you
forgive
a
woman
for
mistaking
you
for
a
fool
they
persuaded
me
to
drive
with
them
to
the
place
in
the
woods
they
were
bound
for
called
kieköwer
where
the
view
over
the
bay
was
said
to
be
very
beautiful
and
when
i
got
on
to
my
feet
i
found
i
was
so
stiff
that
driving
seemed
the
only
thing
possible
ambrose
was
very
kind
and
careful
of
my
bodily
comfort
but
did
not
bother
about
me
spiritually
whenever
there
was
a
hill
and
there
kept
on
being
hills
he
got
out
and
walked
leaving
me
wholly
to
his
mother
but
it
did
not
matter
any
more
for
the
forest
was
so
exquisite
that
way
the
afternoon
so
serene
so
mellow
with
lovely
light
that
i
could
not
look
round
me
without
being
happy
oh
blessed
state
when
mere
quiet
weather
trees
and
grass
sea
and
clouds
can
make
you
forget
that
life
has
anything
in
it
but
rapture
can
make
you
drink
in
heaven
with
every
breath
how
long
will
it
last
this
joy
of
living
this
splendid
ecstasy
of
the
soul
i
am
more
afraid
of
losing
this
of
losing
even
a
little
of
this
of
having
so
much
as
the
edge
of
its
radiance
dimmed
than
of
parting
with
any
other
earthly
possession
and
i
think
of
wordsworth
its
divine
singer
who
yet
lost
it
so
soon
and
could
no
longer
see
the
splendour
in
the
grass
the
glory
in
the
flower
and
i
ask
myself
with
a
sinking
heart
if
it
faded
so
quickly
for
him
who
saw
it
and
sang
it
by
god
grace
to
such
perfection
how
long
oh
how
long
does
the
common
soul
half
blind
half
dead
half
dumb
keep
its
little
precious
share
my
intention
when
i
began
this
book
was
to
write
a
useful
guide
to
rügen
one
that
should
point
out
its
best
parts
and
least
uncomfortable
inns
to
any
english
or
american
traveller
whose
energy
lands
him
on
its
shores
with
every
page
i
write
it
grows
more
plain
that
i
shall
not
fulfil
that
intention
what
for
instance
have
charlotte
and
the
bishop
wife
of
illuminating
for
the
tourist
who
wants
to
be
shown
the
way
as
i
can
not
conscientiously
praise
the
inns
i
will
not
give
their
names
and
what
is
the
use
of
that
to
a
tourist
who
wishes
to
know
where
to
sleep
and
dine
i
meant
to
describe
the
jagdschloss
and
find
i
only
repeated
a
ghost
story
it
is
true
i
said
the
rolls
at
the
inn
there
were
hard
but
the
information
was
so
deeply
embedded
in
superfluities
that
no
tourist
will
discover
it
in
time
to
save
him
from
ordering
one
still
anxious
to
be
of
use
i
will
now
tell
the
traveller
that
he
must
on
no
account
miss
going
from
binz
to
kieköwer
but
that
he
must
go
there
on
his
feet
and
not
allow
himself
to
be
driven
over
the
roots
and
stones
by
the
wives
of
bishops
and
that
shortly
before
he
reaches
kieköwer
low
german
for
look
or
peep
over
he
will
come
to
four
with
a
in
the
middle
and
he
is
to
follow
the
one
to
the
right
which
will
lead
him
to
the
schwarze
see
or
black
lake
and
having
got
there
let
him
sit
down
quietly
and
take
out
the
volume
of
poetry
he
ought
to
have
in
his
pocket
and
bless
god
who
made
this
little
lovely
hollow
on
the
top
of
the
hills
and
drew
it
round
with
a
girdle
of
forest
and
filled
its
reedy
curves
with
white
and
set
it
about
with
silence
and
gave
him
eyes
to
see
its
beauty
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
have
heard
questions
for
quite
a
long
time
for
presently
i
found
she
had
sauntered
round
this
enchanted
spot
to
the
side
where
brosy
was
taking
photographs
and
i
was
sitting
alone
on
the
moss
looking
down
through
the
trees
at
the
lilies
and
listening
only
to
frogs
i
looked
down
between
the
slender
stems
of
some
silver
birches
that
hung
over
the
water
every
now
and
then
a
tiny
gust
of
wind
came
along
and
rippled
their
clear
reflections
ruffling
up
half
of
each
leaf
and
losing
itself
somewhere
among
the
reeds
then
when
it
had
gone
the
lily
leaves
dropped
back
one
after
the
other
on
to
the
calm
water
each
with
a
little
thud
on
the
west
side
the
lake
ends
in
a
reedy
marsh
very
froggy
that
afternoon
and
starred
with
the
snowy
cotton
flower
a
peculiarly
fragrant
smell
like
exceedingly
delicate
russian
leather
hangs
round
the
place
or
did
that
afternoon
it
was
i
suppose
the
hot
sun
bringing
out
the
scent
of
some
hidden
herb
and
it
would
not
always
be
there
but
i
like
to
think
of
the
beautiful
little
lake
as
for
ever
fragrant
all
the
year
round
lying
alone
and
and
enchanted
tucked
away
in
the
bosom
of
the
solitary
hills
when
the
traveller
has
spent
some
time
lying
on
the
moss
with
his
poet
and
he
should
lie
there
long
enough
for
his
soul
to
grow
as
quiet
and
clear
as
the
water
and
the
poet
i
think
should
be
milton
he
can
go
back
to
the
five
minutes
walk
over
beech
leaves
and
so
to
kieköwer
about
half
a
mile
farther
on
the
contrast
between
the
schwarze
see
and
kieköwer
is
striking
coming
from
that
sheltered
place
of
suspended
breath
you
climb
up
a
steep
hill
and
find
yourself
suddenly
on
the
edge
of
high
cliffs
where
the
air
is
always
moving
and
the
wind
blows
freshly
on
to
you
across
the
bay
far
down
below
the
blue
water
heaves
and
glitters
in
the
distance
lies
the
headland
beyond
sassnitz
hazy
in
the
afternoon
light
the
beech
trees
motionless
round
the
lake
here
keep
up
a
ceaseless
rustle
you
who
have
been
so
hot
all
day
find
you
are
growing
almost
too
cool
ist
schön
unsere
ostsee
was
said
a
hearty
male
voice
behind
us
we
were
all
three
leaning
against
the
wooden
rail
put
up
for
our
protection
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
few
yards
off
is
a
shed
where
a
waiter
battered
by
the
sea
breezes
he
is
forced
daily
to
endure
supplies
the
thirsty
with
beer
and
coffee
the
hearty
owner
of
the
voice
brown
with
the
sun
damp
and
jolly
with
exercise
and
stood
looking
over
shoulder
at
the
view
with
an
air
of
proud
proprietorship
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
legs
wide
apart
his
cap
pushed
well
off
an
extremely
heated
brow
he
addressed
this
remark
to
to
whom
i
suppose
she
being
a
matron
of
years
and
patent
sobriety
he
thought
cheery
remarks
might
safely
be
addressed
but
if
there
was
a
thing
the
bishop
wife
disliked
it
was
a
cheery
stranger
the
pedagogue
that
morning
so
artlessly
interested
in
her
conversation
with
me
as
to
forget
he
had
not
met
her
before
had
manifestly
revolted
her
i
myself
the
previous
evening
though
not
cheery
still
a
stranger
had
been
objectionable
to
her
how
much
more
offensive
then
was
a
warm
man
speaking
to
her
with
a
familiarity
so
sudden
and
jolly
as
to
resemble
nothing
so
much
as
a
slap
on
the
back
she
of
course
took
no
notice
of
him
after
the
first
slight
start
and
glance
round
but
stared
out
to
sea
with
eyes
grown
stony
england
you
do
not
see
such
blue
water
what
shouted
the
jolly
man
who
was
plainly
in
the
happy
mood
the
french
call
his
wife
and
daughters
ladies
clothed
in
sitting
at
a
rough
wooden
table
with
empty
before
them
laughed
hilariously
the
mere
fact
of
the
being
so
obviously
english
appeared
to
amuse
them
enormously
they
too
were
in
the
mood
ambrose
as
ready
to
talk
as
his
mother
to
turn
her
back
answered
for
her
and
assured
the
jolly
man
that
he
had
indeed
never
seen
such
blue
water
in
england
this
seemed
to
give
the
whole
family
intense
delight
ja
shouted
the
father
deutschland
über
alles
and
he
trolled
out
that
famous
song
in
the
sort
of
voice
known
as
rich
so
said
ambrose
politely
when
he
had
done
come
we
must
drink
together
cried
the
jolly
man
in
the
best
beer
in
the
world
to
the
health
of
old
england
what
and
he
called
the
waiter
and
in
another
moment
he
and
ambrose
stood
clinking
glasses
and
praising
each
other
countries
while
the
hilarious
family
laughed
and
applauded
in
the
background
the
bishop
wife
had
not
moved
she
stood
staring
out
to
sea
and
her
stare
grew
ever
stonier
wish
she
began
but
did
not
go
on
then
there
being
plainly
no
means
of
stopping
ambrose
cordiality
she
wisely
resolved
to
pass
the
time
while
we
waited
for
him
in
exchanging
luminous
thoughts
with
me
and
we
did
exchange
them
for
some
minutes
until
my
luminousness
was
clouded
and
put
out
by
the
following
short
conversation
must
say
i
can
not
see
what
there
is
about
germans
that
so
fascinates
ambrose
do
you
hear
that
empty
laughter
the
loud
laugh
that
betrays
the
empty
mind
shakespeare
says
frau
you
are
so
beautifully
read
nice
of
you
know
you
are
a
woman
of
a
liberal
mind
so
you
will
not
object
to
my
saying
that
i
am
much
disappointed
in
the
germans
a
bit
has
always
been
so
enthusiastic
about
them
that
i
expected
quite
wonders
what
do
i
find
i
pass
over
in
silence
many
things
including
the
mirth
just
listen
to
those
people
but
i
can
not
help
lamenting
their
complete
want
of
common
sense
sensible
english
people
are
compared
to
them
you
think
so
of
course
in
everything
are
you
not
judging
the
whole
nation
by
the
few
one
can
always
tell
what
could
be
more
supremely
senseless
for
instance
and
she
waved
a
hand
over
the
bay
calling
the
baltic
the
ostsee
but
why
should
they
if
they
want
to
dear
frau
it
is
so
foolish
east
sea
of
what
is
it
the
east
one
is
always
the
east
of
something
but
one
does
talk
about
it
the
name
has
no
meaning
whatever
now
baltic
exactly
describes
it
the
seventh
day
from
binz
to
stubbenkammer
we
left
binz
at
ten
the
next
morning
for
sassnitz
and
stubbenkammer
sassnitz
is
the
principal
on
the
island
and
i
had
meant
to
stay
there
a
night
but
as
neither
of
us
liked
the
glare
of
chalk
roads
and
white
houses
we
went
on
that
day
to
stubbenkammer
where
everything
is
in
the
shade
charlotte
had
not
gone
away
as
she
said
she
would
and
when
i
got
back
to
our
lodgings
the
evening
before
penitent
and
apologetic
after
my
wanderings
in
the
forest
besides
being
rather
frightened
for
i
was
afraid
i
was
going
to
be
scolded
and
was
not
sure
that
i
did
not
deserve
it
i
found
her
sitting
on
the
pillared
verandah
indulgently
watching
the
sunset
sky
with
lying
open
on
her
lap
she
did
not
ask
me
where
i
had
been
all
day
she
only
pointed
to
and
said
is
great
rubbish
which
i
only
answered
later
in
the
evening
i
discovered
that
the
reason
of
her
want
of
interest
in
my
movements
and
absence
of
reproachfulness
was
that
she
herself
had
had
a
busy
and
a
successful
day
judgment
hurried
on
by
charlotte
had
overtaken
the
erring
hedwig
and
the
widow
expressing
horror
and
disgust
had
turned
her
out
charlotte
praised
the
widow
is
an
intelligent
and
a
woman
she
said
assured
me
she
would
rather
do
all
the
work
herself
and
be
left
without
a
servant
altogether
than
keep
a
wicked
girl
like
that
i
was
prepared
to
leave
at
once
if
she
had
not
dismissed
her
then
and
there
still
later
in
the
evening
i
gathered
from
certain
remarks
charlotte
made
that
she
had
lent
the
most
lurid
of
her
works
a
pamphlet
called
beast
of
to
the
widow
who
to
judge
from
satisfaction
was
quite
carried
away
by
it
its
nature
was
certainly
sufficiently
startling
to
carry
any
ordinary
widow
away
we
left
the
next
morning
pursued
by
the
widow
blessings
blessings
of
great
potency
i
suppose
of
the
same
degree
of
potency
exactly
as
the
curses
of
orphans
and
we
all
know
the
peculiar
efficaciousness
of
those
creature
said
charlotte
touched
by
the
number
of
them
as
we
drove
away
am
so
glad
i
was
able
to
help
her
a
little
by
opening
her
eyes
operation
i
observed
not
always
pleasant
invariably
necessary
said
charlotte
with
decision
what
then
was
my
astonishment
on
looking
back
as
we
were
turning
the
corner
by
the
hotel
to
take
a
last
farewell
of
the
pretty
white
house
on
the
shore
to
see
hedwig
hanging
out
of
an
upper
window
waving
a
duster
to
gertrud
who
was
following
us
in
the
luggage
cart
and
chatting
and
laughing
while
she
did
it
with
the
widow
standing
at
the
gate
below
house
is
certainly
haunted
i
exclaimed
a
fresh
ghost
looking
out
of
the
window
at
this
very
moment
charlotte
turned
her
head
with
an
incredulous
face
having
seen
the
apparition
she
turned
it
back
again
ca
be
hedwig
i
hastened
to
assure
her
you
told
me
she
had
been
sent
to
her
mother
in
the
country
it
can
only
then
be
hedwig
ghost
she
is
very
young
to
have
one
is
she
but
charlotte
said
nothing
at
all
and
so
we
left
binz
in
silence
and
got
into
the
sandy
road
and
pine
forest
that
takes
you
the
first
part
of
your
way
towards
the
north
and
sassnitz
the
road
i
had
meant
to
take
goes
straight
from
binz
along
the
narrow
tongue
of
land
marked
schmale
heide
on
the
map
separating
the
baltic
sea
from
the
inland
sea
called
jasmunder
bodden
but
outside
the
village
i
saw
a
sheet
of
calm
water
shining
through
pine
trunks
on
the
left
and
i
got
out
to
go
and
look
at
it
and
august
always
nervous
when
i
got
out
drove
off
the
beaten
track
after
me
and
so
we
missed
our
way
the
water
was
the
schmachter
see
a
real
lake
in
size
not
a
pond
like
the
exquisite
little
schwarze
see
and
i
stood
on
the
edge
admiring
its
morning
loveliness
as
it
lay
without
a
ripple
in
the
sun
the
noise
of
the
sea
on
the
other
side
of
the
belt
of
pines
sounding
unreal
as
the
waves
of
a
dream
on
that
still
shore
and
while
i
was
standing
among
its
reeds
august
was
busy
thinking
out
a
short
cut
that
would
strike
the
road
we
had
left
higher
up
the
result
was
that
we
very
soon
went
astray
and
emerging
from
the
woods
at
the
farm
of
dollahn
found
ourselves
heading
straight
for
the
jasmunder
bodden
but
it
did
not
matter
where
we
went
so
long
as
we
were
pleased
and
when
everything
is
fresh
and
new
how
can
you
help
being
pleased
so
we
drove
on
looking
for
a
road
to
the
right
that
should
bring
us
back
again
to
the
schmale
heide
and
enjoyed
the
open
fields
and
the
bright
morning
and
pretended
to
ourselves
that
it
was
not
dusty
at
least
that
is
what
i
pretended
to
myself
charlotte
pretended
nothing
of
the
sort
on
the
contrary
she
declared
at
intervals
that
grew
shorter
that
she
was
being
suffocated
and
that
is
one
of
the
many
points
on
which
the
walker
has
the
advantage
of
him
who
drives
he
can
walk
on
the
grass
at
the
side
of
the
road
or
over
moss
or
whortleberries
and
need
not
endure
the
dust
kicked
up
by
eight
hoofs
but
where
has
he
not
the
advantage
the
only
one
of
driving
is
that
you
can
take
a
great
many
clean
clothes
with
you
for
the
rest
there
is
no
comparing
the
two
pleasures
and
after
all
what
does
it
matter
if
for
one
fortnight
out
of
all
the
fortnights
there
are
in
a
year
you
are
not
so
clean
as
usual
indeed
i
think
there
must
be
a
quite
peculiar
charm
for
the
habitually
in
being
for
a
short
time
deliberately
dirty
at
lubkow
a
small
village
on
the
jasmunder
bodden
we
got
on
to
the
high
road
to
bergen
and
turning
up
it
to
the
right
faced
northwards
once
more
soon
after
passing
a
forestry
in
the
woods
we
reached
the
schmale
heide
again
and
then
for
four
miles
drove
along
a
white
road
between
young
pines
the
bluest
of
skies
overhead
and
on
our
right
level
with
the
road
the
violet
sea
this
was
the
first
time
i
saw
the
baltic
really
violet
on
other
days
it
had
been
a
deep
blue
or
a
brilliant
green
but
here
it
was
a
wonderful
dazzling
violet
at
neu
mucran
all
these
places
are
on
the
map
we
left
the
high
road
to
go
on
by
itself
up
to
the
inland
town
of
sagard
and
plunged
into
sandy
shadeless
country
roads
trying
to
keep
as
near
the
shore
as
possible
the
rest
of
the
way
to
sassnitz
was
too
unmitigatedly
glaring
and
dusty
to
be
pleasant
there
were
no
trees
at
all
and
as
it
was
uphill
nearly
the
whole
way
we
had
time
to
be
thoroughly
scorched
and
blinded
nor
could
we
keep
near
the
sea
the
road
took
us
farther
and
farther
away
from
it
as
we
toiled
slowly
up
between
cornfields
crammed
on
that
poor
soil
with
poppies
and
marguerites
and
chickory
earth
and
sky
were
one
blaze
of
brightness
our
eyes
filled
with
dust
were
smarting
long
before
we
got
to
the
yet
fiercer
blaze
of
sassnitz
and
it
was
when
we
found
that
the
place
is
all
chalk
and
white
houses
built
in
the
open
with
the
forest
pushed
well
back
behind
that
with
one
accord
we
decided
not
to
stay
in
it
i
would
advise
the
intending
tourist
to
use
sassnitz
only
as
a
place
to
make
excursions
to
from
binz
on
one
side
or
stubbenkammer
on
the
other
though
aware
of
my
peculiarities
i
advise
it
with
diffidence
for
out
of
every
thousand
germans
nine
hundred
and
would
give
with
emphasis
a
contrary
advice
and
the
remaining
one
would
not
agree
with
me
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
enthusiasms
of
other
people
and
can
only
repeat
that
it
is
a
dusty
glaring
place
quaint
enough
on
a
fine
day
with
its
steep
streets
leading
down
to
the
water
and
on
wet
days
dreary
beyond
words
for
its
houses
all
look
as
though
they
were
built
of
cardboard
and
were
only
meant
as
indeed
is
the
case
to
be
used
during
a
few
weeks
in
summer
august
gertrud
and
the
horses
were
sent
to
an
inn
for
a
three
rest
and
we
walked
down
the
little
street
lined
with
stalls
covered
with
amber
ornaments
and
photographs
to
the
sea
as
it
was
the
place
was
empty
and
from
the
different
hotels
came
such
a
hum
and
clatter
of
voices
and
dishes
that
remembering
sellin
we
decided
not
to
go
in
down
on
the
beach
we
found
a
confectioner
shop
directly
overlooking
the
sea
with
and
open
windows
and
no
one
in
it
it
looked
cool
so
we
went
in
and
sat
at
a
marble
table
in
a
draught
and
the
sea
splashed
refreshingly
on
the
shingle
just
outside
and
we
ate
a
great
many
cakes
and
sardines
and
vanilla
ices
and
then
began
to
feel
wretched
shall
we
do
till
four
i
inquired
disconsolately
leaning
my
elbows
on
the
and
watching
the
heat
dancing
outside
over
the
shingle
said
somebody
stopping
beneath
the
window
walk
with
us
to
stubbenkammer
of
course
it
was
ambrose
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
white
linen
a
cool
and
beautiful
vision
here
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
in
binz
came
across
for
the
day
in
a
steamer
my
mother
is
waiting
for
me
in
the
shade
she
sent
me
to
get
some
biscuits
and
then
we
are
going
to
stubbenkammer
come
too
but
the
heat
a
minute
i
coming
in
there
to
get
the
biscuits
he
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
door
being
behind
is
is
he
i
said
to
charlotte
dislike
that
type
of
healthy
successful
young
animal
because
you
have
eaten
so
many
cakes
and
sardines
i
said
soothingly
you
never
serious
invariably
i
find
nothing
more
tiring
than
talking
to
a
person
who
is
persistently
playful
only
those
three
vanilla
ices
i
assured
her
encouragingly
here
too
frau
nieberlein
exclaimed
ambrose
coming
in
good
you
will
come
with
us
wo
you
it
a
beautiful
walk
shade
the
whole
way
and
i
have
just
got
that
work
of
the
professor
about
the
phrygians
and
want
to
talk
about
it
frightfully
badly
i
been
reading
it
all
night
it
the
most
marvellous
book
no
wonder
it
revolutionised
european
thought
absolutely
he
bought
his
biscuits
as
one
in
a
dream
so
greatly
did
he
glow
with
rapture
on
charlotte
i
said
walk
will
do
us
both
good
i
send
word
to
august
to
meet
us
at
stubbenkammer
but
charlotte
would
not
come
on
she
would
sit
there
quietly
she
said
bathe
perhaps
later
and
then
drive
to
stubbenkammer
tell
you
what
frau
nieberlein
cried
ambrose
from
the
counter
never
envied
a
woman
before
but
i
must
say
i
envy
you
what
a
marvellously
glorious
fate
to
be
the
wife
of
such
an
extraordinary
thinker
well
then
i
said
quickly
not
knowing
what
charlotte
reply
might
be
come
on
with
august
and
meet
us
there
lottchen
and
i
hurried
ambrose
and
his
biscuits
out
looking
up
as
we
passed
beneath
the
window
we
saw
charlotte
still
sitting
at
the
marble
table
gazing
into
space
cousin
is
wonderful
about
the
professor
said
ambrose
as
we
crossed
a
scorching
bit
of
chalky
promenade
to
the
trees
where
was
waiting
what
way
wonderful
i
asked
uneasily
for
i
had
no
wish
to
discuss
the
nieberlein
conjugalities
with
him
so
so
quiet
so
modest
never
trots
him
out
never
puts
on
airs
because
she
his
wife
oh
quite
wonderful
yes
about
those
phrygians
and
so
i
got
his
thoughts
away
from
charlotte
and
by
the
time
we
had
found
his
mother
i
knew
far
more
about
phrygians
than
i
should
have
thought
possible
the
walk
along
the
coast
from
sassnitz
to
stubbenkammer
is
alone
worth
a
journey
to
rügen
i
suppose
there
are
few
walks
in
the
world
more
wholly
beautiful
from
beginning
to
end
on
no
account
therefore
should
the
traveller
all
unsuspecting
of
so
much
beauty
so
near
at
hand
be
persuaded
to
go
to
stubbenkammer
by
road
the
road
will
give
him
merely
a
pretty
country
drive
taking
him
the
shortest
way
quite
out
of
sight
of
the
sea
the
path
keeps
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
and
is
a
series
of
exquisite
surprises
but
only
the
lusty
and
the
spare
must
undertake
it
for
it
is
not
to
be
done
under
three
hours
and
is
an
almost
continual
going
down
countless
steps
into
deep
ravines
and
up
countless
steps
out
of
them
again
you
are
however
in
the
shade
of
beeches
the
whole
time
and
who
shall
describe
as
you
climb
higher
and
higher
the
lovely
sparkle
and
colour
of
the
sea
as
it
curls
far
below
you
in
and
out
among
the
folds
of
the
cliffs
was
sufficiently
spare
to
enjoy
the
walk
ambrose
was
perfectly
content
telling
us
about
nieberlein
new
work
i
was
perfectly
content
too
because
only
one
ear
was
wanted
for
nieberlein
and
i
still
had
one
over
for
the
larks
and
the
lapping
of
the
water
besides
both
my
happy
eyes
we
did
not
hurry
but
lingered
over
each
beauty
resting
on
little
sunny
plateaus
high
up
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliffs
where
sitting
on
the
hot
sweet
grass
we
saw
the
colour
of
the
sea
shine
through
the
colour
of
the
fringing
scabious
a
divine
meeting
of
colours
often
to
be
seen
along
the
rügen
coast
in
july
or
in
the
deep
shade
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
we
rested
on
the
moss
by
water
trickling
down
over
slimy
green
stones
to
the
sea
which
looked
from
those
dark
places
like
a
great
wall
of
light
listened
with
a
placid
pride
to
her
explanations
of
the
scope
and
nature
of
nieberlein
book
his
enthusiasm
made
him
talk
so
much
that
she
perforce
was
silent
and
her
love
for
him
written
so
plainly
on
her
face
showed
what
she
must
have
been
like
in
her
best
days
the
younger
days
before
her
husband
got
his
gaiters
and
began
to
grieve
besides
during
the
last
and
steepest
part
of
the
walk
we
were
beyond
the
range
of
other
tourists
for
they
had
all
dropped
off
at
the
waldhalle
a
place
where
you
drink
so
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
to
offend
her
we
arrived
therefore
at
stubbenkammer
about
six
in
a
state
of
perfect
concord
pleasantly
tired
and
hot
enough
to
be
glad
we
had
got
there
on
the
plateau
in
front
of
the
restaurant
there
is
of
course
a
restaurant
at
the
climax
of
the
walk
there
were
tables
under
the
trees
and
people
eating
and
drinking
one
table
at
a
little
distance
from
the
others
with
the
best
view
over
the
cliff
had
a
white
cloth
on
it
and
was
spread
for
what
looked
like
tea
there
were
nice
thin
cups
and
strawberries
and
a
teapot
and
a
jug
in
the
middle
with
roses
in
it
and
while
i
was
wondering
who
were
the
privileged
persons
for
whom
it
had
been
laid
gertrud
came
out
of
the
restaurant
followed
by
a
waiter
carrying
thin
bread
and
butter
and
then
i
knew
that
the
privileged
persons
were
ourselves
had
tea
with
you
yesterday
i
said
to
it
is
your
turn
to
have
tea
with
me
charming
said
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
sinking
into
a
chair
and
smelling
the
roses
maid
seems
to
be
one
of
those
rare
treasures
who
like
doing
extra
things
for
their
mistresses
well
gertrud
is
a
rare
treasure
and
it
did
look
clean
and
dainty
next
to
the
tables
at
which
coffee
was
being
drunk
and
spilt
by
tourists
who
had
left
their
gertruds
at
home
then
the
place
was
so
wonderful
the
white
cliffs
cutting
out
sheer
and
sharp
into
the
sea
their
huge
folds
filled
with
every
sort
of
greenery
masses
of
shrubby
trees
masses
of
ferns
masses
of
down
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
steamer
anchored
the
one
by
which
the
were
going
back
later
to
binz
quite
a
big
steamer
and
it
looked
from
where
we
were
like
a
tiny
white
toy
fear
the
gracious
one
will
not
enjoy
sleeping
here
whispered
gertrud
as
she
put
a
pot
of
milk
on
the
table
made
inquiries
on
arrival
and
the
hotel
is
entirely
full
and
only
one
small
bedroom
in
a
pavilion
detached
among
trees
can
be
placed
at
the
gracious
disposal
my
cousin
room
has
two
beds
and
the
cousin
of
the
gracious
one
is
sitting
on
one
of
them
we
have
been
here
already
an
hour
august
is
installed
the
horses
are
well
accommodated
here
i
have
an
attic
of
sufficient
comfort
only
the
ladies
will
suffer
will
go
to
my
cousin
show
me
i
pray
thee
the
way
excusing
myself
to
i
followed
gertrud
at
the
back
of
the
restaurant
there
is
an
open
space
where
a
great
many
in
red
covers
were
being
aired
on
the
grass
while
fowls
and
the
waiting
drivers
of
the
sassnitz
waggonettes
wandered
about
among
them
in
the
middle
of
this
space
is
a
big
bare
yellow
house
the
only
hotel
in
stubbenkammer
the
only
house
in
fact
that
i
saw
at
all
and
some
distance
to
the
left
of
this
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
dank
dark
and
the
pavilion
i
said
scanning
it
with
a
sinking
heart
yet
did
i
sleep
in
a
pavilion
know
it
gracious
one
shutterless
windows
on
a
level
with
the
elbows
of
the
the
gracious
one
says
is
but
too
true
will
enter
and
speak
with
my
cousin
charlotte
charlotte
was
as
gertrud
had
said
sitting
on
one
of
the
two
beds
that
nearly
filled
the
room
she
was
feverishly
writing
something
in
pencil
on
the
margin
of
beast
of
and
looked
up
with
an
eager
worried
expression
when
i
opened
the
door
it
not
terrible
she
said
one
should
not
be
able
to
do
more
than
one
best
and
that
one
best
is
never
enough
what
the
matter
everything
the
matter
you
are
all
dull
indifferent
deadened
to
everything
that
is
vital
you
do
care
you
let
things
slide
and
if
any
one
tries
to
wake
you
up
and
tell
you
the
truth
you
never
never
listen
me
i
asked
confused
into
this
sad
grammar
by
her
outburst
she
threw
the
pamphlet
down
and
jumped
up
i
am
sick
of
all
your
sins
and
stupidities
she
cried
pulling
her
hat
straight
and
sticking
violent
pins
into
it
mine
i
asked
in
great
perplexity
would
almost
seem
said
charlotte
fixing
me
with
angry
eyes
would
really
almost
seem
that
there
is
no
use
whatever
in
devoting
life
to
one
one
naturally
likes
to
be
left
alone
i
murmured
i
try
to
do
is
to
pull
them
out
of
the
mud
when
they
are
in
it
to
warn
them
when
they
are
going
in
it
and
to
help
them
when
they
have
been
in
it
that
sounds
very
noble
being
full
of
noble
intentions
why
on
earth
my
dear
charlotte
ca
you
be
placid
you
are
never
placid
come
and
have
some
tea
what
with
those
wretched
people
those
leathern
souls
those
along
it
is
only
tea
it
strawberries
and
roses
and
looks
lovely
those
people
half
kill
me
they
are
so
pleased
with
themselves
so
satisfied
with
life
such
prigs
such
toadies
what
have
i
in
common
with
them
ambrose
is
not
a
toady
at
all
he
nothing
but
a
dear
and
his
mother
has
her
points
why
not
try
to
do
them
good
you
be
interested
in
them
at
once
if
you
look
upon
them
as
patients
i
put
my
arm
through
hers
and
drew
her
out
of
the
room
stuffy
room
is
enough
to
depress
anybody
i
said
i
know
what
worrying
you
it
that
widow
know
what
an
irritating
trick
of
yours
exclaimed
charlotte
turning
on
me
always
explaining
the
reason
why
i
say
or
feel
what
i
do
say
or
feel
and
is
there
any
reason
widow
has
no
power
to
worry
me
her
hypocrisy
will
bear
its
own
fruit
and
she
will
have
to
eat
it
then
when
the
catastrophe
comes
the
sure
consequence
of
folly
and
weakness
she
do
what
you
all
do
in
face
of
the
inevitable
sit
and
lament
and
say
it
was
somebody
fault
and
of
course
every
single
thing
that
happens
to
you
is
never
anybody
fault
but
your
own
miserable
self
wish
you
would
teach
me
to
dodge
what
you
call
the
inevitable
i
said
though
it
wanted
any
teaching
said
charlotte
stopping
short
in
the
middle
of
the
open
space
before
our
table
to
look
into
my
eyes
only
not
got
to
be
silly
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
am
silly
naturally
silly
born
it
tea
is
getting
very
cold
called
out
plaintively
she
had
been
watching
us
with
impatience
and
seemed
perturbed
the
moment
we
got
near
enough
she
informed
us
that
the
tourists
were
such
that
no
decent
woman
could
stand
it
has
gone
off
with
one
of
them
she
said
most
terrible
old
man
to
look
at
some
view
over
there
would
you
believe
it
while
we
were
quietly
sitting
here
not
harming
anybody
this
person
came
up
the
hill
and
immediately
began
to
talk
to
us
as
if
we
knew
each
other
he
actually
had
the
audacity
to
ask
if
he
might
sit
with
us
at
this
table
as
there
was
no
room
elsewhere
he
was
objectionable
of
course
i
refused
the
most
pushing
person
i
have
met
at
all
there
is
ample
room
said
charlotte
to
whom
everything
the
bishop
wife
said
and
did
appeared
bad
my
dear
frau
nieberlein
a
complete
stranger
and
such
an
unpleasantly
jocular
old
man
and
i
think
it
so
very
to
be
jocular
in
the
wrong
places
always
think
it
a
pity
to
people
said
charlotte
sternly
she
was
not
it
seemed
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
from
the
bishop
wife
must
be
dying
for
some
tea
i
interposed
pouring
it
out
as
one
who
should
pour
oil
on
troubled
waters
you
should
consider
continued
charlotte
in
fifty
years
we
shall
all
be
dead
and
our
opportunities
for
being
kind
will
be
over
dear
frau
nieberlein
ejaculated
the
astonished
bishop
wife
it
is
certain
i
said
only
be
eighty
then
charlotte
and
what
is
eighty
when
i
am
eighty
i
hope
to
be
a
gay
granddame
skilled
in
gestic
lore
frisking
beneath
the
burthen
of
fourscore
but
the
bishop
wife
did
not
like
being
told
she
would
be
dead
in
fifty
years
and
no
artless
quotations
of
mine
could
make
her
like
it
so
she
drank
her
tea
with
an
offended
face
then
she
remarked
will
tell
me
i
ought
to
have
accepted
the
proposal
one
of
the
other
tourists
a
woman
made
me
a
moment
ago
she
suggested
that
i
should
drive
back
to
sassnitz
with
her
and
her
party
and
halve
the
expense
of
the
fly
and
why
should
you
not
said
charlotte
should
i
not
there
were
two
excellent
reasons
why
i
should
not
first
because
it
was
an
impertinence
and
secondly
because
i
am
going
back
in
the
boat
second
reason
is
good
but
you
must
pardon
my
seeing
no
excellence
whatever
in
the
first
son
tea
will
be
undrinkable
i
said
feebly
interrupting
i
can
never
see
two
people
contradicting
each
other
without
feeling
wretched
why
contradict
why
argue
at
all
only
one
one
closest
and
most
understanding
should
be
contradicted
and
argued
with
how
simple
to
keep
quiet
with
all
the
rest
and
agree
to
everything
they
say
charlotte
up
to
this
had
kept
very
quiet
in
the
presence
of
had
said
yes
in
the
right
places
and
had
only
been
listless
and
bored
now
after
reading
her
own
explosive
pamphlet
for
an
hour
stirred
besides
by
the
widow
base
behaviour
and
by
the
failure
of
her
effort
to
induce
penitence
in
hedwig
by
means
of
punishment
she
was
in
the
strenuous
mood
again
and
inclined
to
see
all
manner
of
horrid
truths
and
fates
hovering
round
the
harmless
where
denser
eyes
like
mine
and
no
doubt
only
saw
a
pleasant
flicker
of
beech
leaves
over
cups
and
saucers
and
bland
strawberries
in
a
nest
of
green
women
did
not
regard
each
other
advances
with
so
much
suspicion
charlotte
proceeded
emphatically
they
did
not
look
upon
every
one
of
a
slightly
different
class
as
an
impossible
person
to
be
avoided
they
would
make
a
much
better
show
in
the
fight
for
independent
existence
the
value
of
is
so
gigantic
yes
i
fancy
i
remember
your
saying
something
like
this
at
that
lecture
in
oxford
last
winter
interrupted
with
an
immense
plaintiveness
can
not
be
said
too
often
yes
dear
frau
nieberlein
believe
me
it
can
what
for
instance
has
it
to
do
with
my
being
asked
to
drive
back
to
sassnitz
with
a
strange
family
in
a
fly
with
that
it
has
very
much
to
do
i
interposed
smiling
pleasantly
on
them
both
would
have
paid
half
and
what
is
if
it
is
not
paying
half
indeed
i
been
told
by
people
who
have
done
it
that
it
sometimes
even
means
paying
all
in
which
case
you
do
see
its
point
i
mean
of
course
said
charlotte
moral
a
ceaseless
working
together
of
its
members
for
the
welfare
of
the
sex
no
opportunity
should
ever
be
lost
one
should
always
be
ready
to
talk
to
to
get
to
know
to
encourage
one
must
cultivate
a
large
love
for
humanity
to
whatever
class
it
belongs
and
however
individually
objectionable
it
is
you
no
doubt
she
continued
waving
her
teaspoon
at
the
staring
bishop
wife
refused
the
very
innocent
invitation
of
your
because
she
was
badly
dressed
and
had
manners
of
a
type
with
which
you
are
not
acquainted
you
considered
it
an
impertinence
nay
more
than
an
impertinence
an
insult
to
be
approached
in
such
a
manner
now
how
can
you
tell
here
she
leaned
across
the
table
and
in
her
earnestness
pointed
the
teaspoon
straight
at
who
stared
harder
than
ever
will
you
ever
know
that
the
woman
did
not
happen
to
be
full
full
to
the
brim
of
that
good
soil
in
which
the
seed
of
a
few
encouraging
words
dropped
during
your
drive
would
have
produced
a
splendid
harvest
of
energy
and
freedom
my
dear
frau
nieberlein
said
the
bishop
wife
much
taken
aback
by
this
striking
image
do
not
think
she
was
full
of
anything
of
the
kind
she
did
not
look
so
anyhow
and
i
myself
to
pursue
your
metaphor
am
hardly
fitted
for
the
office
of
an
agricultural
implement
i
believe
all
these
things
are
done
nowadays
by
machinery
are
they
not
she
asked
turning
to
me
in
a
effort
to
get
away
from
the
subject
and
picturesque
sower
has
been
quite
superseded
has
he
not
are
you
talking
about
farming
asked
ambrose
who
came
up
at
this
moment
are
talking
of
the
farming
of
souls
replied
charlotte
said
ambrose
in
his
turn
taken
aback
he
pretended
to
be
so
busy
sitting
down
that
he
could
say
more
than
just
oh
we
watched
him
in
silence
fussing
into
his
chair
pleasant
it
is
here
he
went
on
when
he
was
settled
i
do
mind
cold
tea
a
bit
really
mother
why
would
you
let
the
old
man
sit
with
us
he
a
frightfully
good
sort
there
are
certain
limits
beyond
which
i
decline
to
go
replied
his
mother
visibly
annoyed
that
he
should
thus
unconsciously
side
with
charlotte
but
it
was
rough
on
him
do
you
think
so
frau
nieberlein
we
have
the
biggest
table
and
only
it
and
there
is
another
place
to
be
had
it
is
so
characteristically
british
for
us
to
sit
here
and
keep
other
people
out
he
have
to
wait
heaven
knows
how
long
for
his
coffee
and
he
has
walked
miles
think
said
charlotte
slowly
loudly
and
weightily
he
might
very
well
have
joined
us
you
did
not
see
him
protested
assure
you
he
really
was
impossible
worse
than
the
woman
we
were
talking
about
can
only
say
said
charlotte
even
slower
louder
and
more
weightily
one
should
before
all
things
be
human
and
that
one
has
no
right
whatever
to
turn
one
back
on
the
smallest
request
of
a
hardly
had
she
said
it
hardly
had
the
bishop
wife
had
time
to
open
her
mouth
and
stare
in
stoniest
astonishment
hardly
had
i
had
time
to
follow
her
petrified
gaze
than
an
old
man
in
a
long
waterproof
garment
with
a
green
felt
hat
set
askew
on
his
venerable
head
came
nimbly
up
behind
charlotte
and
bending
down
to
her
unsuspecting
ear
shouted
into
it
the
amazing
monosyllable
the
seventh
day
at
stubbenkammer
i
believe
i
have
somewhere
remarked
that
charlotte
was
not
the
kind
of
person
one
could
ever
tickle
she
was
also
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
whom
most
people
would
want
to
say
bo
the
effect
on
her
of
this
bo
was
alarming
she
started
up
as
though
she
had
been
struck
and
then
stood
as
one
turned
to
stone
brosy
jumped
up
as
if
to
protect
her
looked
really
frightened
and
gasped
is
the
old
man
again
an
escaped
lunatic
how
very
unpleasant
no
i
hurriedly
explained
is
the
professor
professor
what
never
the
what
professor
brosy
brosy
she
leaned
over
and
seized
his
coat
in
an
agony
of
haste
breathe
it
the
old
man
i
been
talking
about
never
breathe
it
it
professor
nieberlein
himself
exclaimed
brosy
flushing
all
over
his
face
but
the
professor
took
no
notice
of
any
of
us
for
he
was
diligently
kissing
charlotte
he
kissed
her
first
on
one
cheek
then
he
kissed
her
on
the
other
cheek
then
he
pulled
her
ears
then
he
tickled
her
under
the
chin
and
he
beamed
upon
her
all
the
while
with
such
an
uninterrupted
radiance
that
the
coldest
heart
must
have
glowed
only
to
see
it
here
i
meet
thee
little
treasure
he
cried
once
more
thy
twitter
falls
upon
my
ears
i
knew
at
once
thy
little
chirp
i
heard
it
above
all
the
drinking
noises
come
come
i
said
to
myself
if
that
is
not
the
little
lot
and
chirping
the
tune
i
know
of
old
in
the
beautiful
english
tongue
turn
not
your
back
on
a
creature
turn
not
your
back
only
on
the
old
husband
one
turns
the
pretty
back
what
fie
fie
the
naughty
little
lot
i
protest
i
never
saw
a
stranger
sight
than
this
of
charlotte
being
toyed
with
and
the
rigidity
of
her
the
simple
german
ways
are
cried
in
a
great
flutter
to
me
while
the
toying
was
going
on
she
was
so
torn
by
horror
at
what
she
had
said
and
by
rapture
at
meeting
the
professor
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
really
does
one
good
to
be
given
a
peep
at
genuine
family
emotions
delightful
professor
you
heard
what
he
said
to
the
duke
after
he
had
gone
all
the
way
to
bonn
on
purpose
to
see
him
and
my
dear
frau
a
duke
and
she
whispered
the
name
in
my
ear
as
though
it
were
altogether
too
great
to
be
said
aloud
i
conceded
by
a
nod
that
he
was
a
very
superior
duke
but
what
the
professor
said
to
him
i
never
heard
for
at
that
moment
charlotte
dropped
back
into
her
chair
and
the
professor
immediately
scrambled
i
fear
there
is
no
other
word
he
did
scramble
into
the
next
one
to
her
which
was
brosy
you
kindly
present
me
said
brosy
to
charlotte
standing
reverential
and
before
the
great
man
i
know
you
my
young
friend
already
said
the
professor
genially
have
just
been
admiring
nature
together
at
this
the
bishop
wife
blushed
deeply
thoroughly
a
thing
i
suppose
she
had
not
done
for
years
and
cast
a
supplicating
look
at
charlotte
who
sat
rigid
with
her
eyes
on
her
plate
brosy
blushed
too
and
bowed
profoundly
can
not
tell
you
sir
how
greatly
honoured
i
feel
at
being
allowed
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
said
tut
said
the
professor
present
me
to
these
ladies
what
he
did
not
remember
me
what
after
the
memorable
evening
in
berlin
i
know
of
few
things
more
wholly
grievous
than
to
have
a
celebrated
connection
who
forgets
he
has
ever
seen
you
must
apologise
to
you
madam
he
said
to
the
bishop
wife
for
taking
a
seat
at
your
table
after
all
professor
murmured
you
will
perhaps
forgive
my
joining
a
party
of
which
my
wife
is
a
member
professor
do
pray
believe
know
a
brown
he
continued
england
there
is
a
brown
i
know
he
is
of
a
great
skill
in
hold
i
know
another
brown
nay
i
know
several
relations
no
doubt
of
yours
madam
sir
our
name
is
i
understood
brown
so
it
is
harvey
yes
yes
harvey

the
excellent
sauce
i
eat
it
daily
with
my
fish
madam
a
public
benefactor
we
are
not
related
we
are
the
you
are
both
harveys
and
browns
and
yet
not
related
to
either
browns
or
harveys
nay
but
that
is
a
problem
to
split
the
head
husband
is
the
bishop
of
babbacombe
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
him
professor
he
too
is
literary
he
annotates
any
case
madam
his
wife
speaks
admirable
german
said
the
professor
with
a
little
bow
this
lady
he
asked
turning
to
me
i
am
charlotte
cousin
i
said
no
longer
able
to
hide
my
affliction
at
the
rapid
way
in
which
he
had
forgotten
me
accordingly
yours
do
you
not
remember
i
met
you
last
winter
in
berlin
at
a
party
at
the
hofmeyers
course
of
course
that
is
to
say
i
fear
of
course
not
i
have
no
memory
at
all
for
things
of
importance
but
one
can
never
have
too
many
little
cousins
can
one
young
man
sit
thee
down
next
to
me
then
shall
i
be
indeed
a
happy
man
with
my
little
wife
on
one
side
and
my
little
cousin
on
the
other
so
now
we
are
comfortable
and
when
my
coffee
comes
i
shall
ask
for
nothing
more
young
man
when
you
marry
see
to
it
that
your
wife
has
many
nice
little
cousins
it
is
very
important
as
for
my
not
remembering
thee
he
went
on
putting
one
arm
round
the
back
of
my
chair
while
the
other
was
round
the
back
of
charlotte
not
offended
for
i
tell
thee
that
the
day
after
i
married
my
lot
here
i
fell
into
so
great
an
abstraction
that
i
started
for
a
walking
tour
in
the
alps
with
some
friends
i
met
and
for
an
entire
week
she
passed
from
my
mind
it
was
at
lucerne
so
completely
did
she
pass
from
it
that
i
omitted
to
tell
her
i
was
going
or
bid
her
farewell
i
went
dost
thou
remember
lottchen
i
came
to
myself
on
the
top
of
pilatus
a
week
after
our
wedding
day
what
ails
thee
man
said
my
comrades
for
i
was
disturbed
i
must
go
down
at
once
i
cried
i
have
forgotten
something
bah
you
do
not
need
your
umbrella
up
here
they
said
for
they
knew
i
forget
it
much
it
is
not
my
umbrella
that
i
have
left
behind
i
cried
it
is
my
wife
they
were
surprised
for
i
had
forgotten
to
tell
them
i
had
a
wife
and
when
i
got
down
to
lucerne
there
was
the
poor
lot
quite
offended
and
he
pulled
her
nearest
ear
and
laughed
till
his
spectacles
grew
dim
whispered
to
her
son
natural
her
son
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
professor
ready
to
pounce
on
the
first
word
of
wisdom
and
assimilate
it
as
a
hungry
cat
might
sit
ready
for
the
mouse
that
unaccountably
delays
yes
sighed
the
professor
stretching
out
his
legs
under
the
table
and
stirring
the
coffee
the
waiter
had
set
before
him
forget
young
man
that
the
only
truly
important
thing
in
life
is
women
little
round
soft
women
little
purring
eh
lot
some
of
them
will
not
always
purr
will
they
little
lot
some
of
them
mew
much
some
of
them
scratch
some
of
them
have
days
when
they
will
only
wave
their
naughty
little
tails
in
anger
but
all
are
soft
and
pleasant
and
add
much
grace
to
the
fireside
true
murmured
in
a
rapture
very
very
true
so
so
different
from
nietzsche
thou
art
silent
little
treasure
he
continued
pinching
charlotte
cheek
thou
lovest
not
the
image
of
the
little
cats
said
charlotte
and
the
word
was
jerked
up
from
an
interior
manifestly
molten
then
pass
me
those
strawberries
that
blink
so
pleasantly
from
their
bed
of
green
and
while
i
eat
pour
out
of
thy
dear
heart
all
that
it
contains
concerning
pussies
which
interest
thee
greatly
as
i
well
know
and
all
else
that
it
contains
and
has
contained
since
last
i
saw
thee
for
it
is
long
since
i
heard
thy
voice
and
i
have
missed
thee
much
art
thou
not
my
dearest
wife
clearly
it
was
time
for
me
to
get
up
and
remove
the
out
of
earshot
i
prepared
to
do
so
but
at
the
first
movement
the
arm
along
the
back
of
the
chair
slid
down
and
gripped
hold
of
me
so
restless
not
so
restless
little
cousin
said
the
professor
smiling
rosily
i
not
tell
thee
i
am
happy
so
and
wilt
thou
mar
the
happiness
of
a
good
old
man
you
have
charlotte
and
you
must
wish
to
talk
to
her
do
i
wish
it
but
talking
to
charlotte
excludeth
not
the
encircling
of
elizabeth
and
have
i
not
two
arms
want
to
go
and
show
the
view
from
the
cliff
i
said
appalled
at
the
thought
of
what
charlotte
when
she
did
begin
to
speak
would
probably
say
tut
said
the
professor
gripping
me
tighter
are
very
well
so
the
contemplation
of
virtuous
happiness
is
at
least
as
edifying
for
this
lady
as
the
contemplation
of
water
from
a
cliff
originality
murmured
you
flatter
me
said
the
professor
whose
ears
were
quick
no
professor
indeed
it
is
not
flattery
i
am
the
more
obliged
have
so
long
wished
we
could
meet
you
my
son
spent
the
whole
of
last
summer
in
bonn
trying
to
do
so
of
time
waste
of
time
madam
and
all
in
vain
and
this
year
we
were
both
there
before
coming
up
here
and
did
all
we
could
but
also
unfortunately
in
vain
it
really
seems
as
if
providence
had
expressly
led
us
to
this
place
madam
is
continually
leading
people
to
places
and
then
leading
them
away
again
i
for
instance
am
to
be
led
away
again
from
this
one
with
great
rapidity
for
i
am
on
foot
and
must
reach
a
bed
by
nightfall
here
there
is
nothing
to
be
had
you
must
come
back
to
binz
with
us
cried
steamer
leaves
in
an
hour
and
i
am
sure
room
could
be
found
for
you
in
our
hotel
my
son
would
gladly
give
you
his
if
necessary
he
would
feel
only
too
proud
if
you
would
take
it
would
you
not
brosy
i
am
overwhelmed
by
your
amiability
you
will
however
understand
that
i
can
not
leave
my
wife
where
i
go
she
comes
too
is
it
not
so
little
treasure
i
am
only
waiting
to
hear
her
plans
to
arrange
mine
accordingly
i
have
no
luggage
i
am
very
movable
my
night
attire
is
on
my
person
beneath
the
attire
appropriate
to
the
day
in
one
pocket
of
my
mantle
i
carry
an
extra
pair
of
socks
in
another
my
handkerchiefs
of
which
there
are
two
and
my
sponge
damp
and
cool
is
embedded
in
the
crown
of
my
hat
thus
madam
i
am
of
a
remarkable
independence
its
one
restriction
is
the
necessity
of
finding
a
shelter
daily
before
dark
tell
me
little
lot
is
there
no
room
for
the
old
husband
here
with
thee
and
there
was
something
so
sweet
in
his
smile
as
he
turned
to
her
that
i
think
if
she
had
seen
it
she
must
have
followed
him
wherever
he
went
but
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
go
to
berlin
this
evening
she
said
have
important
engagements
and
must
leave
at
once
dear
frau
nieberlein
exclaimed
the
bishop
wife
not
this
very
sudden
brosy
who
had
been
looking
uncomfortable
for
some
minutes
quite
apart
from
not
having
got
his
mouse
pulled
out
his
watch
and
stood
up
we
are
to
catch
that
steamer
mother
i
think
it
would
be
wise
to
start
he
said
brosy
it
does
go
for
an
hour
said
revolted
at
the
notion
of
being
torn
from
her
celebrity
in
the
very
moment
of
finding
him
am
afraid
we
must
insisted
brosy
takes
much
longer
to
get
down
the
cliff
than
one
would
suppose
and
it
is
slippery
i
want
to
take
you
down
an
easier
and
rather
longer
way
and
he
carried
her
off
ruthlessly
cutting
short
her
parting
entreaties
that
the
professor
would
come
too
come
then
come
without
fail
the
next
day
then
to
binz
and
he
took
her
as
i
observed
straight
in
the
direction
of
the
hertha
see
as
a
beginning
of
the
easy
descent
and
the
hertha
see
as
everybody
knows
is
in
the
exactly
contrary
direction
to
the
one
he
ought
to
have
gone
but
no
doubt
he
filled
up
the
hour
instructively
with
stories
of
the
ancient
heathen
rites
performed
on
those
mystic
shores
and
so
left
charlotte
free
to
behave
to
her
husband
as
she
chose
how
she
did
behave
i
can
easily
guess
for
hurrying
off
into
the
pavilion
desirous
of
nothing
except
to
get
out
of
the
way
i
had
hardly
had
time
to
marvel
that
she
should
be
able
to
dislike
such
an
old
dear
when
she
burst
in
quick
help
me
to
get
my
things
she
cried
flying
up
and
down
the
slit
of
a
room
and
pouncing
on
the
bags
stowed
away
by
gertrud
in
corners
can
just
catch
the
night
train
at
sassnitz
i
off
to
berlin
i
write
to
you
from
there
why
if
that
fool
gertrud
has
emptied
everything
out
what
a
terrible
fate
yours
is
always
at
the
mercy
of
an
overfed
underling
a
person
who
empties
bags
without
being
asked
give
me
those
brushes
and
the
papers
well
you
seen
me
dragged
down
into
the
depths
have
you
and
she
straightened
herself
from
bending
over
the
bag
a
brush
in
each
hand
and
looking
at
me
with
a
most
bitter
and
defiant
smile
incontinently
began
to
cry
cry
charlotte
i
said
who
had
been
dumbly
staring
cry
my
dear
i
did
see
any
depths
i
only
saw
nice
things
do
go
to
berlin
stay
here
and
let
us
be
happy
together
here
never
and
she
feverishly
crammed
things
into
her
bag
and
the
bag
must
have
been
at
least
as
full
of
tears
as
of
other
things
for
she
cried
bitterly
the
whole
time
well
women
have
always
been
a
source
of
wonderment
to
me
myself
included
who
am
for
ever
hurled
in
the
direction
of
foolishness
for
ever
unable
to
stop
and
never
are
they
so
mysterious
so
wholly
unaccountable
as
in
their
relations
to
their
husbands
but
who
shall
judge
them
the
paths
of
fate
are
all
so
narrow
that
two
people
bound
together
forced
to
walk
abreast
can
not
except
they
keep
perfect
step
but
push
each
other
against
the
rocks
on
either
side
so
that
it
behoves
the
weaker
and
the
lighter
if
he
would
remain
unbruised
to
be
very
attentive
very
adaptable
very
deft
i
saw
charlotte
off
in
one
of
the
waiting
waggonettes
that
was
to
take
her
to
sassnitz
where
the
railway
begins
let
you
know
where
i
am
she
called
out
as
she
was
rattled
away
down
the
hill
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
she
turned
the
corner
and
vanished
from
my
sight
gone
once
more
into
those
frozen
regions
where
noble
and
forlorn
persons
pursue
ideals
walking
back
slowly
through
the
trees
towards
the
cliffs
i
met
the
professor
looking
everywhere
for
his
wife
time
does
lot
leave
he
cried
when
he
saw
me
she
really
go
is
gone
how
long
since
ten
minutes
i
too
take
that
train
and
he
hurried
off
clambering
with
the
nimbleness
that
was
all
his
own
into
a
second
waggonette
and
disappeared
in
his
turn
down
the
hill
little
cousin
he
shouted
just
before
being
whisked
round
the
corner
me
to
bid
thee
farewell
and
wish
thee
good
luck
i
shall
seriously
endeavour
to
remember
thee
this
time
i
called
back
smiling
but
he
could
not
have
heard
once
again
i
slowly
walked
through
the
trees
to
the
cliffs
the
highest
of
these
cliffs
the
königsstuhl
jutting
out
into
the
sea
forms
a
plateau
where
a
few
trees
that
have
weathered
the
winter
storms
of
many
years
stand
in
little
groups
for
a
long
while
i
sat
on
the
knotted
roots
of
one
of
them
listening
to
the
slow
wash
of
the
waves
on
the
shingle
far
below
i
saw
the
ribbon
of
smoke
left
by
the
steamer
get
thinner
and
disappear
i
watched
the
fade
out
of
the
sky
and
sea
and
all
the
world
grow
grey
and
full
of
secrets
once
after
i
had
sat
there
a
very
long
time
i
thought
i
heard
the
faint
departing
whistle
of
a
train
and
my
heart
leapt
up
with
exultation
oh
the
gloriousness
of
freedom
and
silence
of
being
alone
with
my
own
soul
once
more
i
drew
a
long
long
breath
and
stood
up
and
stretched
myself
in
the
supreme
comfort
of
complete
relaxation
look
very
happy
said
a
rather
grudging
voice
close
to
me
it
belonged
to
a
fräulein
of
uncertain
age
come
up
to
the
plateau
in
galoshes
to
commune
in
her
turn
with
night
and
nature
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
smiling
foolishly
all
over
my
face
after
the
manner
of
those
whose
thoughts
are
pleasant
a
impulse
seized
me
to
stare
at
her
and
turn
my
back
but
i
strangled
it
you
know
why
i
look
happy
i
inquired
instead
and
my
voice
was
as
the
voice
of
why
was
the
eagerly
inquisitive
answer
i
am
and
nodding
sweetly
i
walked
away
the
eighth
day
from
stubbenkammer
to
glowe
when
reason
lecturing
us
on
certain
actions
explains
that
they
are
best
avoided
and
experience
with
her
drives
the
lesson
home
why
do
we
convinced
and
battered
repeat
the
actions
every
time
we
get
the
chance
i
have
known
from
my
youth
the
opinion
of
solomon
that
he
that
passeth
by
and
meddleth
with
strife
belonging
not
to
him
is
like
one
that
taketh
a
dog
by
the
ears
and
i
have
a
wise
relative
not
a
but
still
very
wise
who
at
suitable
intervals
addresses
me
in
the
following
manner
meddle
yet
now
i
have
to
relate
how
on
the
eighth
day
of
my
journey
round
rügen
in
defiance
of
reason
experience
solomon
and
the
wise
relative
i
began
to
meddle
the
first
desire
came
upon
me
in
the
night
when
i
could
not
sleep
because
of
the
mosquitoes
and
the
constant
coming
into
the
pavilion
of
late
and
jovial
tourists
the
tourists
came
in
in
jolly
batches
till
well
on
towards
morning
singing
about
things
like
the
rhine
and
the
fatherland
frontiers
glorious
songs
and
very
gory
as
they
passed
my
window
on
their
way
round
to
the
door
after
each
batch
had
gone
i
got
out
and
cautiously
opened
the
window
again
and
then
waited
for
the
next
ones
slaying
mosquitoes
while
i
waited
and
it
was
while
i
lay
there
sleepless
and
tormented
that
the
longing
to
help
reunite
charlotte
and
her
husband
first
entered
my
head
it
is
true
that
i
was
bothered
for
some
time
trying
to
arrive
at
a
clear
comprehension
of
what
constitutes
selfishness
but
i
gave
that
up
for
it
only
made
my
head
ache
surely
charlotte
for
instance
was
intensely
selfish
to
leave
her
home
and
heedless
of
her
husband
unhappiness
live
the
life
she
preferred
but
was
not
he
equally
selfish
in
wanting
to
have
her
back
again
for
whose
happiness
would
that
be
he
could
not
suppose
for
hers
if
she
determined
to
be
unselfish
went
home
she
would
only
be
pandering
to
his
selfishness
the
more
she
destroyed
her
individuality
and
laid
its
broken
remains
at
his
feet
the
more
she
would
be
developing
evil
qualities
in
the
acceptor
of
such
a
gift
we
are
taught
that
our
duty
is
to
make
each
other
good
and
happy
not
bad
and
happy
charlotte
therefore
would
be
doing
wrong
if
making
the
professor
happy
she
also
made
him
bad
because
he
had
a
sweet
way
with
him
and
she
had
not
he
got
all
the
sympathy
including
mine
and
of
course
the
whole
of
that
windy
mass
of
biassed
superficiality
called
public
opinion
was
on
his
side
but
how
can
one
if
one
truly
loves
a
woman
wish
her
to
live
a
life
that
must
make
her
wretched
such
love
can
only
be
selfish
accordingly
the
professor
was
selfish
they
were
both
selfish
and
if
one
were
not
so
the
other
would
be
more
so
and
if
to
be
unselfish
meant
making
those
about
you
the
opposite
then
it
must
be
wrong
and
were
it
conceivable
that
a
whole
family
should
determine
to
be
unselfish
and
actually
carry
out
the
dreadful
plan
life
in
that
doomed
house
would
become
a
perpetual
de
not
in
any
way
to
be
borne
here
it
was
that
my
head
began
to
ache
stuff
is
this
i
thought
veering
round
suddenly
to
the
easeful
simplicity
of
the
old
conventions
to
think
of
it
gives
me
a
headache
the
only
thing
i
know
of
that
does
not
give
a
woman
a
headache
is
to
live
the
life
for
which
she
was
intended
the
comfortable
life
with
a
brain
at
rest
and
a
body
wholly
occupied
with
benevolences
and
if
her
meekness
makes
her
husband
bad
what
does
that
matter
in
the
end
to
any
one
but
him
charlotte
ought
to
be
very
happy
with
that
kind
old
man
any
woman
would
be
her
leaving
him
must
have
been
owing
to
some
trifling
misunderstanding
i
am
sure
it
would
be
for
her
happiness
to
go
back
to
him
she
would
grow
quite
round
and
mellow
could
i
not
do
something
say
something
to
get
her
to
give
him
another
trial
i
wish
oh
i
wish
i
could
now
from
time
to
time
the
wise
relative
quoted
above
amplifies
his
advice
in
the
following
manner
all
forms
of
meddling
that
which
deals
with
man
and
wife
is
to
the
meddler
the
most
immediately
fatal
but
where
are
the
persons
who
take
advice
i
never
yet
met
them
when
the
first
shaft
of
sunshine
slanted
through
my
window
it
fell
on
me
in
my
feverishly
writing
to
charlotte
the
eloquence
of
that
letter
i
really
think
it
had
all
the
words
in
it
i
know
except
those
about
growing
round
and
mellow
something
told
me
that
they
would
not
appeal
to
her
i
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
locked
it
in
my
till
unconscious
of
what
was
in
store
for
her
she
should
send
me
her
address
and
then
full
of
the
glow
that
warms
the
doer
of
good
actions
equally
with
the
officious
i
put
on
my
bathing
things
a
decent
skirt
and
cloak
over
them
got
out
of
the
window
and
went
down
the
cliff
to
the
beach
to
bathe
the
water
was
icily
cold
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
but
it
was
a
wonderful
feeling
getting
all
the
closeness
of
the
night
dashed
off
me
in
that
vast
and
splendid
morning
solitude
dripping
i
hurried
up
again
my
skirt
and
cloak
over
the
soaked
bathing
dress
my
wet
feet
thrust
into
shoes
i
could
never
afterwards
wear
a
trickle
of
salt
water
marking
the
way
i
took
it
was
just
five
as
i
got
in
at
the
window
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
dry
and
dressed
and
out
of
the
window
a
second
time
getting
in
and
out
of
that
window
had
a
singular
fascination
for
me
and
on
my
way
for
an
early
exploring
of
the
woods
but
those
stubbenkammer
woods
were
destined
never
to
be
explored
by
me
for
i
had
hardly
walked
ten
minutes
along
their
beechen
ways
listening
to
the
birds
and
stopping
every
few
steps
to
look
up
at
the
blue
of
the
sky
between
the
branches
before
i
came
to
the
hertha
see
a
mysterious
silent
pond
of
black
water
with
reeds
round
it
and
solemn
forest
paths
and
on
the
moss
by
the
shore
of
the
hertha
see
his
eyes
fixed
on
its
sullen
waters
deep
in
thought
sat
the
professor
tell
me
you
have
forgotten
me
again
i
exclaimed
anxiously
for
his
eyes
turned
from
the
lake
to
me
as
i
came
over
the
moss
to
him
in
an
unchanged
abstraction
what
was
he
doing
there
he
looked
exceedingly
untidy
and
his
boots
were
white
with
dust
morning
i
said
cheerfully
as
he
continued
to
gaze
straight
through
me
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
this
was
the
place
he
remarked
klüver
was
correct
in
his
conjecture
what
is
the
use
i
said
sitting
down
on
the
moss
beside
him
talking
to
me
like
that
when
i
do
know
the
beginning
who
is
klüver
and
what
did
he
conjecture
his
eyes
suddenly
flashed
out
of
their
dream
and
he
smiled
and
patted
my
hand
it
is
the
little
cousin
he
said
looking
pleased
is
may
i
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
agreeing
with
klüver
that
this
is
undoubtedly
the
spot
spot
describes
it
so
accurately
that
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
tacitus
i
thought
klüver
had
something
to
do
with
charlotte
where
is
charlotte
the
procession
of
the
goddess
nerthus
or
hertha
mother
of
the
earth
passing
through
these
sacred
groves
on
the
way
to
bless
her
children
her
car
is
covered
so
that
no
eye
shall
behold
her
the
priest
alone
walking
by
the
side
is
permitted
to
touch
it
wherever
she
passes
holyday
is
kept
arms
are
laid
aside
peace
reigns
absolute
no
man
may
seek
to
slay
his
brother
while
she
who
blesses
all
alike
is
passing
among
her
children
then
when
she
has
once
more
been
carried
to
her
temple
in
this
water
thou
here
seest
in
this
very
lake
her
car
and
its
draperies
are
cleansed
by
slaves
who
after
performing
their
office
are
themselves
thrown
into
the
water
and
left
to
perish
for
they
had
laid
hands
on
that
which
was
holy
and
even
when
we
are
in
the
defence
of
our
adorations
and
rarely
set
up
altars
in
our
souls
that
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
professor
i
said
is
perfectly
sweet
of
you
to
tell
me
about
the
goddess
nerthus
but
would
you
mind
before
you
go
any
further
telling
me
where
charlotte
is
when
i
last
saw
you
you
were
whirling
after
her
in
a
waggonette
did
you
ever
catch
her
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
then
gave
the
bulging
pocket
of
his
waterproof
a
sounding
slap
cousin
he
said
me
thou
beholdest
a
dreamer
of
dreams
an
unpractical
greybeard
a
venerable
never
i
suppose
shall
i
learn
to
remember
unaided
those
occurrences
that
i
fain
would
not
forget
therefore
i
assist
myself
by
making
notes
of
them
to
which
i
can
refer
unfortunately
it
seldom
happens
that
i
remember
to
refer
thou
however
hast
reminded
me
of
them
i
will
now
seek
them
out
and
he
dragged
different
articles
from
the
bulging
pocket
laying
them
carefully
on
the
moss
beside
him
in
tidy
rows
but
the
fact
of
only
one
of
the
two
handkerchiefs
being
there
nearly
put
him
off
the
track
so
much
and
so
long
did
he
marvel
where
its
fellow
could
be
also
the
sight
of
his
extra
pair
of
socks
reminded
him
of
the
urgent
need
they
were
in
of
mending
and
he
broke
off
his
search
for
the
to
hold
each
up
in
turn
to
me
and
eloquently
lament
nein
was
fur
socken
he
moaned
with
a
final
shake
of
the
head
as
he
spread
them
out
too
on
the
moss
they
are
very
bad
i
agreed
for
the
tenth
time
they
are
emblematic
you
let
me
mend
them
or
rather
i
hastily
added
them
to
be
mended
for
my
aversion
to
needles
is
at
least
as
great
as
charlotte
no
what
is
the
use
there
are
cupboards
full
of
socks
like
them
in
bonn
skeletons
of
that
which
once
was
socks
mere
outlines
filled
in
with
holes
all
are
emblematic
single
one
but
this
time
he
looked
at
me
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
do
think
i
said
i
let
my
soul
be
ruffled
by
a
sock
if
it
offended
me
i
throw
it
away
and
buy
some
more
wisdom
cried
the
professor
gaily
from
the
mouth
of
an
intellectual
suckling
and
without
more
ado
he
flung
both
the
socks
into
the
hertha
see
there
they
lay
like
strange
flowers
of
yellow
wool
motionless
on
the
face
of
the
mystic
waters
now
the
i
asked
for
he
had
relapsed
into
immobility
and
was
watching
the
socks
with
abstracted
eyes
yes
the
being
heavy
it
was
at
the
very
bottom
of
what
was
more
like
a
sack
in
size
than
a
pocket
but
once
he
had
run
his
glance
over
the
latest
entries
he
began
very
volubly
to
tell
me
what
he
had
been
doing
all
night
it
had
been
an
even
busier
night
than
mine
charlotte
he
explained
had
left
sassnitz
by
the
berlin
train
and
had
taken
a
ticket
for
berlin
as
he
ascertained
at
the
a
few
minutes
before
he
took
his
he
arrived
at
the
very
last
moment
yet
as
he
jumped
into
the
just
departing
train
he
caught
sight
of
her
sitting
in
a
ladies
compartment
she
also
caught
sight
of
him
therefore
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
continued
my
pipe
and
contemplating
the
evening
heavens
from
the
window
happy
in
the
thought
of
being
so
near
my
little
wife
i
fell
into
an
abstraction
i
shook
my
head
abstractions
professor
i
observed
inconvenient
things
to
fall
into
what
had
happened
by
the
time
you
fell
out
again
found
that
i
had
emerged
from
my
compartment
and
was
standing
on
the
ferry
that
takes
the
train
across
the
water
to
stralsund
the
ancient
city
rose
in
venerable
majesty
mind
the
ancient
city
dearest
professor
look
at
your
notes
again
what
was
charlotte
doing
she
had
entirely
escaped
my
memory
so
great
was
the
pleasure
excited
in
my
breast
by
the
contemplation
of
the
starlit
scene
before
me
but
glancing
away
from
the
massive
towers
of
stralsund
my
eye
fell
on
the
word
on
the
window
of
the
ladies
carriage
instantly
remembering
charlotte
i
clambered
up
eager
to
speak
to
her
the
compartment
was
empty
too
was
contemplating
the
starlit
scene
from
the
deck
of
the
ferry
was
not
there
no
bags
in
the
carriage
a
bag
had
become
of
her
had
left
the
train
and
i
tell
thee
how
at
bergen
our
only
we
crossed
a
train
returning
to
sassnitz
plentiful
applications
of
to
officials
revealed
the
fact
that
she
had
changed
into
this
train
very
clever
i
thought
no
said
the
professor
as
if
he
had
heard
me
thinking
little
lot
cleverness
invariably
falls
just
short
of
the
demands
made
upon
it
at
critical
moments
when
the
choice
lies
between
the
substance
and
the
shadow
i
have
observed
she
unfailingly
chooses
the
shadow
this
comical
life
she
leads
what
is
it
but
a
pursuit
of
shadows
however
and
he
stopped
short
not
caring
i
suppose
to
discuss
his
wife
do
you
think
she
is
now
conjecture
not
far
from
here
i
arrived
at
sassnitz
at
one
this
morning
by
the
swedish
i
was
told
that
a
lady
answering
her
description
had
got
out
there
at
eleven
taken
a
fly
and
driven
into
the
town
i
walked
out
here
to
speak
with
thee
and
was
only
waiting
for
the
to
seek
thee
out
for
she
will
not
being
so
near
thee
omit
to
join
thee
must
be
perfectly
exhausted
i
most
wish
for
is
breakfast
let
us
go
and
see
if
we
ca
get
some
gertrud
will
be
up
by
now
and
can
produce
coffee
at
the
shortest
notice
is
gertrud
another
dear
little
cousin
if
it
be
so
lead
me
i
pray
thee
at
once
to
gertrud
i
laughed
and
explaining
gertrud
to
him
helped
him
pack
his
pocket
again
then
we
started
for
the
hotel
full
of
hope
each
thinking
that
if
charlotte
were
not
already
there
she
would
very
soon
turn
up
but
charlotte
was
not
there
nor
did
she
though
we
loitered
over
our
coffee
till
we
ended
by
being
as
late
as
the
latest
tourist
turn
up
is
certain
to
come
during
the
day
said
the
professor
i
told
him
i
had
arranged
to
go
to
glowe
that
day
a
little
place
farther
along
the
coast
and
he
said
he
would
in
that
case
engage
my
vacant
for
himself
and
stay
that
night
at
stubbenkammer
is
certain
to
come
here
he
repeated
i
will
not
lose
her
a
second
time
wo
like
the
pavilion
i
remarked
about
eleven
there
being
still
no
signs
of
charlotte
i
set
out
on
foot
on
the
first
stage
of
my
journey
to
glowe
sending
the
carriage
round
by
road
to
meet
me
at
lohme
the
place
where
i
meant
to
stop
for
lunch
and
going
myself
along
the
footpath
down
on
the
shore
the
professor
who
was
a
great
walker
and
extraordinarily
active
for
his
years
came
with
me
part
of
the
way
he
intended
he
said
to
go
into
sassnitz
that
afternoon
if
charlotte
did
not
appear
before
then
and
make
inquiries
and
meanwhile
he
would
walk
a
little
with
me
so
we
started
very
gaily
down
the
same
zigzag
path
up
which
i
had
crawled
dripping
a
few
hours
before
at
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
the
from
stubbenkammer
to
lohme
begins
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
lovely
path
from
sassnitz
but
less
steep
it
keeps
closer
to
the
beach
it
is
a
white
chalk
path
running
along
the
foot
of
cliffs
clothed
with
moss
and
every
kind
of
and
fern
masses
of
the
leaves
of
lilies
of
the
valley
show
what
it
must
look
like
in
may
and
on
the
day
we
walked
there
the
space
between
the
twisted
beech
trunks
twisted
into
the
strangest
contortions
under
the
lash
of
winter
storms
was
blue
with
wild
campanula
what
a
walk
that
was
the
sea
lay
close
to
our
feet
in
great
green
and
blue
streaks
the
leaves
of
the
beeches
on
our
left
seemed
carved
in
gold
they
shone
so
motionless
against
the
sky
and
the
professor
was
so
gay
so
certain
that
he
was
going
to
find
charlotte
that
he
almost
danced
instead
of
walking
he
talked
to
me
there
is
no
doubt
as
he
might
have
talked
to
quite
a
little
child
of
erudition
there
was
not
a
sign
of
wisdom
in
brosy
sense
not
a
word
but
what
of
that
the
happy
result
was
that
i
understood
him
and
i
know
we
were
very
merry
if
i
were
charlotte
nothing
would
induce
me
to
stir
from
the
side
of
a
man
who
could
make
me
laugh
why
what
a
quality
in
a
husband
how
precious
and
how
rare
think
of
living
with
a
person
who
looks
at
the
world
with
the
kindliest
amused
eyes
imagine
having
a
perpetual
spring
of
pleasant
mirth
in
one
own
house
babbling
coolly
of
refreshing
things
on
days
when
life
is
dusty
must
not
wholesomeness
pervade
the
very
cellars
and
of
such
a
home
well
i
meant
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
persuade
charlotte
to
go
into
the
home
again
how
delightful
to
be
the
means
of
doing
the
dear
old
man
beside
me
a
good
turn
meanwhile
he
walked
along
happily
all
unconscious
that
i
was
meditating
good
turns
perhaps
happy
for
that
very
reason
and
full
of
confidence
in
his
ability
to
catch
and
to
keep
charlotte
she
goes
i
go
with
her
he
said
now
have
my
summer
leisure
and
can
devote
myself
entirely
to
her
not
fall
into
abstractions
then
dear
professor
at
important
moments
i
said
and
inwardly
rehearsed
the
eloquent
pleadings
with
which
i
meant
to
shake
charlotte
soul
when
next
i
saw
her
we
said
where
the
wood
ends
and
the
white
path
goes
out
into
the
sun
sure
you
let
me
know
when
you
meet
charlotte
i
said
want
particularly
to
speak
to
her
something
really
important
tell
her
so
and
i
have
a
letter
for
her
if
i
ca
see
her
do
forget
i
sleep
at
glowe
i
telegraph
where
i
stay
do
forget
wo
you
be
very
nice
and
make
notes
of
it
he
promised
wished
me
godspeed
kissed
my
hand
and
turned
back
into
the
wood
swinging
his
stick
and
humming
gay
little
tunes
and
i
went
on
in
the
sun
to
lohme
there
i
bathed
again
a
delicious
solitary
bathe
just
as
the
woman
was
locking
up
for
the
day
and
afterwards
when
she
had
gone
away
up
the
cliff
to
her
dinner
i
sat
on
the
empty
beach
in
the
sun
and
thought
of
all
i
was
going
to
say
to
charlotte
it
interested
me
so
much
that
i
forgot
i
had
meant
to
lunch
at
lohme
and
when
i
remembered
it
it
was
already
time
to
go
up
and
meet
the
carriage
it
did
not
matter
as
the
midday
meal
is
the
best
one
to
leave
out
and
lohme
is
not
the
kind
of
place
i
would
ever
want
to
lunch
in
the
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
is
quiet
and
pleasant
and
from
it
you
can
see
the
misty
headland
of
arkona
with
its
lighthouse
the
northernmost
point
of
the
island
far
away
on
the
left
lohme
itself
is
a
small
group
of
hotels
and
on
the
top
of
low
cliffs
very
small
and
modest
compared
even
to
binz
and
sassnitz
which
are
not
very
big
themselves
and
much
more
difficult
to
get
at
there
is
no
railway
nearer
than
sassnitz
and
the
few
steamers
that
stop
there
disgorge
the
tourist
who
wants
to
get
out
into
a
small
boat
and
steam
away
leaving
him
to
his
fate
which
is
only
a
nice
one
on
quite
calm
days
safely
on
land
he
climbs
up
a
shadeless
zigzag
path
which
must
be
beautiful
in
june
for
the
cliffs
are
thickly
covered
with
bushes
and
at
the
top
finds
himself
among
the
of
lohme
the
only
thing
i
saw
when
i
got
to
the
top
that
made
me
linger
was
a
row
of
tubs
filled
with
nasturtiums
along
the
little
terrace
in
front
of
the
first
hotel
i
passed
the
way
those
nasturtiums
blazed
against
the
vast
blue
curtain
of
sea
and
sky
that
hung
behind
them
with
no
tree
or
bush
anywhere
near
to
shadow
their
fierce
splendour
was
a
sight
well
worth
coming
to
lohme
for
there
is
no
shade
anywhere
at
lohme
it
stands
entirely
exposed
out
in
the
open
beyond
the
stubbenkammer
forest
and
on
a
dull
day
must
be
dreary
it
is
i
imagine
a
convenient
place
for
quiet
persons
who
do
not
wish
to
spend
much
and
the
air
is
beautiful
in
spite
of
the
heat
i
felt
as
if
it
were
the
most
bracing
air
i
had
yet
come
across
on
my
journey
the
carriage
was
waiting
just
outside
the
empty
sunny
little
place
in
a
road
that
winds
chalkily
between
undulating
fields
in
the
direction
of
glowe
gertrud
face
wore
a
look
of
satisfaction
as
she
got
into
her
old
seat
beside
me
and
took
out
her
knitting
she
had
not
been
able
to
knit
during
those
few
dreadful
days
in
which
her
place
had
been
usurped
and
she
had
bumped
after
us
ignominiously
in
a
cart
and
how
pleasant
it
was
not
to
have
the
ceaseless
rattle
just
behind
yes
it
became
more
and
more
clear
that
charlotte
ought
to
be
in
her
own
home
with
her
husband
her
being
there
would
undoubtedly
promote
the
general
peace
and
why
should
she
go
about
stirring
people
up
and
forcing
them
to
be
dogged
by
luggage
carts
the
road
wound
higher
through
the
cornfields
dwindling
at
last
into
a
stony
track
the
country
heaved
away
in
ample
undulations
on
either
side
there
were
no
trees
but
so
many
flowers
that
even
the
ruts
were
blue
with
chickory
on
the
right
over
the
cornfields
lay
the
baltic
i
could
still
see
arkona
in
front
of
me
on
the
dim
edge
of
the
world
down
at
our
feet
stretched
the
calm
silver
of
the
jasmunder
bodden
the
biggest
of
those
inland
seas
that
hollow
out
the
island
into
a
mere
frame
and
a
tongue
of
black
and
narrow
curved
northwards
between
its
pale
waters
and
the
vigorous
blue
of
the
sea
i
stopped
the
carriage
as
i
love
to
do
in
lonely
places
and
there
was
no
sound
but
a
faint
whispering
in
the
corn
we
drove
down
over
stones
between
grassy
banks
to
a
tiny
village
with
a
very
ancient
church
and
the
pleasing
name
of
bobbin
i
looked
wistfully
up
at
the
church
on
its
mound
as
we
passed
below
it
it
was
very
old
six
centuries
the
said
and
fain
would
i
have
gone
into
it
but
i
knew
it
would
be
locked
and
did
not
like
to
disturb
the
parson
for
the
key
the
parson
himself
came
along
the
road
at
that
moment
and
he
looked
so
kind
and
his
eye
was
so
mild
that
i
got
out
and
inquired
of
him
with
what
i
hope
was
an
engaging
modesty
whether
the
were
correct
about
the
six
centuries
he
was
amiability
itself
not
only
he
said
was
the
church
ancient
but
interesting
would
i
like
to
see
it
please
then
would
i
come
to
the
parsonage
while
he
got
the
key
thank
you
the
bobbin
parsonage
is
a
delightful
little
house
of
the
kind
that
i
dream
of
for
my
declining
years
with
latticed
windows
and
a
vine
it
stands
in
a
garden
so
pretty
so
full
of
narrow
paths
disappearing
round
corners
that
i
longed
far
more
to
be
shown
where
they
led
to
than
to
be
shown
the
inside
of
the
church
several
times
i
said
things
that
ought
to
have
resulted
in
my
being
taken
along
them
but
the
parson
heeded
not
his
talk
was
and
remained
wholly
church
a
friendly
dog
lay
among
croquet
hoops
on
the
lawn
a
pleasant
silent
dog
who
wagged
his
tail
when
i
came
round
the
corner
and
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
bark
and
sniff
no
one
else
was
to
be
seen
the
house
was
so
quiet
it
seemed
asleep
while
i
waited
in
the
parlour
the
parson
took
me
down
a
little
path
to
the
church
talking
amiably
on
the
way
he
was
proud
he
said
of
his
church
very
proud
on
on
sundays
so
few
people
came
to
the
services
that
his
pride
was
quenched
by
the
aspect
of
the
empty
seats
a
bell
began
to
toll
as
we
reached
the
door
in
answer
to
my
inquiring
look
he
said
it
was
the
the
and
was
rung
three
times
a
day
at
eight
and
twelve
and
four
so
that
the
scattered
inhabitants
of
the
lonely
the
sower
in
the
field
the
housewife
among
her
pots
the
fisherman
on
the
bodden
or
over
there
in
quiet
weather
on
the
sea
might
hear
it
and
join
together
spiritually
at
those
hours
in
a
common
prayer
do
they
i
asked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
murmured
of
hopes
it
is
the
quaintest
church
the
vaulted
chancel
is
the
oldest
part
and
there
is
an
altarpiece
put
there
by
the
swedish
wrangel
who
in
the
seventeenth
century
lived
in
a
turreted
schloss
near
by
that
i
had
seen
from
the
hills
a
seat
high
up
on
the
side
of
the
chancel
was
where
he
sat
it
has
latticed
windows
and
panels
with
his
arms
in
the
middle
panel
and
those
of
prince
putbus
to
whom
the
schloss
now
belongs
on
either
side
the
parson
took
me
up
into
the
gallery
and
showed
me
a
picture
of
john
the
baptist
head
just
off
with
herodias
trying
to
pull
out
its
tongue
i
said
i
thought
it
nasty
and
he
told
me
it
had
been
moved
up
there
because
the
lady
downstairs
over
whose
head
it
used
to
hang
was
made
ill
by
it
every
sunday
had
the
parishioners
up
in
the
gallery
thicker
skins
i
asked
but
there
was
no
question
of
skins
because
the
congregation
never
overflowed
into
the
galleries
there
is
another
picture
up
there
the
supper
at
emmaus
with
the
scripture
account
written
underneath
in
latin
the
parson
read
this
aloud
and
his
eyes
otherwise
so
mild
woke
into
gleams
of
enthusiasm
it
sounded
very
dignified
and
compressed
to
ears
accustomed
to
luther
lengthy
rendering
of
the
same
thing
i
remarked
how
beautiful
it
was
and
with
a
pleased
smile
he
at
once
read
it
again
and
then
translated
it
into
greek
lingering
lovingly
over
each
of
the
beautiful
words
i
sat
listening
in
the
cool
of
the
dusty
little
gallery
gazing
out
at
the
summer
fields
and
the
glistening
water
of
the
bodden
through
the
open
door
his
gentle
voice
made
a
soft
droning
in
the
emptiness
a
swallow
came
in
and
skimmed
about
anxiously
trying
to
get
out
again
painted
pulpit
was
also
given
by
wrangel
said
the
parson
as
we
went
downstairs
seems
to
have
given
a
great
deal
needed
to
to
make
good
all
his
sins
he
replied
with
a
smile
were
the
sins
he
committed
i
smiled
too
posterity
in
the
shape
of
the
parishioners
of
bobbin
have
been
direct
gainers
by
wrangel
sins
you
see
comes
out
of
evil
i
observed
he
shook
his
head
painted
pulpits
do
then
i
amended
for
who
that
is
in
his
senses
would
contradict
a
parson
i
gave
a
last
glance
at
the
quaint
pulpit
across
which
a
shaft
of
coloured
sunlight
lay
inquired
if
i
might
make
an
offering
for
the
poor
of
bobbin
made
it
thanked
my
amiable
guide
and
was
accompanied
by
him
out
into
the
heat
that
danced
among
the
tombstones
down
to
the
carriage
to
the
last
he
was
mild
and
kind
tucking
the
holland
cover
round
me
with
the
same
solicitude
that
he
might
have
shown
in
a
january
snowstorm
glowe
my
destination
is
not
far
from
bobbin
on
the
way
we
passed
the
schloss
with
the
four
towers
where
the
wicked
wrangel
committed
all
those
sins
that
presently
crystallised
into
a
painted
pulpit
the
schloss
called
the
spyker
schloss
is
let
to
a
farmer
we
met
him
riding
home
to
his
coffee
i
suppose
it
being
now
nearly
five
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
beautiful
old
garden
with
ancient
pyramids
of
box
many
flowers
broad
alleys
and
an
aggressively
new
baby
in
a
perambulator
beneath
the
trees
rending
the
holy
quiet
of
the
afternoon
with
its
shrieks
they
pursued
us
quite
a
long
way
along
the
bald
high
road
that
brought
us
after
another
mile
to
glowe
glowe
is
a
handful
of
houses
built
between
the
high
road
and
the
sea
there
is
nothing
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
but
a
great
green
plain
stretching
to
the
bodden
we
stopped
at
the
first
inn
we
came
to
it
was
almost
the
first
house
a
meek
ugly
little
place
with
the
following
severe
advice
to
tourists
hanging
up
in
the
entrance
was
du
willst
kurz
und
alle
schöne
phrasen
fehlen
nutzlos
unsere
zeit
uns
uns
und
du
sollst
nicht
accordingly
i
was
very
short
with
the
landlord
when
he
appeared
left
out
most
of
my
articles
all
of
my
adjectives
clipped
my
remarks
of
weaknesses
such
as
please
and
thank
you
and
became
at
last
ferociously
monosyllabic
in
my
effort
to
give
satisfaction
my
room
was
quite
nice
with
two
windows
looking
across
the
plain
cows
were
tethered
on
it
almost
to
where
the
bodden
glittered
in
the
sun
and
it
was
scattered
over
with
great
pale
patches
of
clover
on
the
left
was
the
spyker
schloss
with
the
spire
of
bobbin
church
behind
it
far
away
in
front
blue
with
distance
but
still
there
rose
as
usual
the
round
tower
of
the
ubiquitous
jagdschloss
i
leaned
out
into
the
sunshine
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
freshness
of
the
pines
i
had
seen
from
the
heights
and
the
freshness
of
the
invisible
sea
some
one
downstairs
was
playing
sadly
on
a
cello
tunes
that
reeked
of
and
overhead
the
larks
shrilled
an
exquisite
derision
i
thought
i
would
combine
luncheon
tea
and
dinner
in
one
meal
and
so
have
done
with
food
for
the
day
so
i
said
to
the
landlord
still
careful
to
be
und
food
i
left
it
to
him
to
decide
what
food
and
he
brought
me
fried
eels
and
asparagus
first
sausages
with
cranberries
second
and
coffee
with
gooseberry
jam
last
it
was
odd
and
indigestible
but
quite
clean
afterwards
i
went
down
to
the
shore
through
an
stuffy
little
garden
at
the
back
where
mosquitoes
hummed
round
the
heads
of
silent
sitting
statuesquely
in
tiny
arbours
and
flies
buzzed
about
me
in
a
cloud
on
the
shore
the
fishermen
children
were
wading
about
and
playing
in
the
parental
smacks
the
sea
looked
so
clear
that
i
thought
it
would
be
lovely
to
have
yet
another
bathe
so
i
sent
a
boy
to
call
gertrud
and
set
out
along
the
beach
to
the
very
distant
and
solitary
it
was
clean
and
convenient
but
there
were
more
local
children
playing
in
it
darting
in
and
out
of
the
dusky
cells
like
bats
no
one
was
in
charge
and
rows
of
towels
and
clothes
hung
up
on
hooks
only
asking
to
be
used
gertrud
brought
my
things
and
i
got
in
the
water
seemed
desperately
cold
and
stinging
colder
far
than
the
water
at
stubbenkammer
that
morning
almost
intolerably
cold
but
perhaps
it
only
seemed
so
because
of
the
eels
and
cranberries
that
had
come
too
the
children
were
deeply
interested
and
presently
undressed
and
followed
me
in
one
girl
bathing
only
in
her
pinafore
they
were
very
kind
to
me
showed
me
the
least
stony
places
encouraged
me
when
i
shivered
and
made
a
tremendous
noise
i
concluded
for
my
benefit
because
after
every
outburst
they
paused
and
looked
at
me
with
modest
pride
when
i
got
out
they
got
out
too
and
insisted
on
helping
gertrud
wring
out
my
things
i
distributed
among
them
when
i
was
dressed
and
they
clung
to
me
closer
than
ever
after
that
escorting
me
in
a
body
back
to
the
inn
and
hardly
were
they
to
be
persuaded
to
leave
me
at
the
door
that
evening
was
one
of
profound
peace
i
sat
at
my
bedroom
window
my
body
and
soul
in
a
perfect
harmony
of
content
my
body
had
been
so
much
bathed
and
walked
about
all
day
that
it
was
incapable
of
intruding
its
shadow
on
the
light
of
the
soul
and
remained
entirely
quiescent
pleased
to
be
left
quiet
and
forgotten
in
an
the
light
of
my
soul
feeble
as
it
had
been
since
thiessow
burned
that
night
clear
and
steady
for
once
more
i
was
alone
and
could
breathe
and
think
and
rejoice
over
the
serenity
of
the
next
few
days
that
lay
before
me
like
a
fair
landscape
in
the
sun
and
when
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
island
and
my
drive
i
would
go
home
and
devote
ardent
weeks
to
bringing
charlotte
and
the
professor
together
again
if
necessary
i
would
even
ask
her
to
come
and
stay
with
me
so
much
stirred
was
i
by
the
desire
to
do
good
is
not
a
work
i
have
cared
about
since
one
that
i
made
with
infinite
enthusiasm
resulted
a
few
months
later
in
reproaches
of
a
bitter
nature
being
heaped
on
my
head
by
the
persons
matched
but
surely
to
help
reunite
two
noble
souls
one
of
which
is
eager
to
be
reunited
and
the
other
only
does
not
know
what
it
really
wants
is
a
blessed
work
anyhow
the
contemplation
of
it
made
me
glow
after
the
sun
had
dropped
behind
the
black
line
of
pines
on
the
right
the
plain
seemed
to
wrap
itself
in
peace
the
road
beneath
my
window
was
quite
quiet
except
for
the
occasional
clatter
past
of
a
child
in
wooden
shoes
of
all
the
places
i
had
stayed
at
in
rügen
this
place
was
the
most
countrified
and
innocent
idly
i
sat
there
enjoying
the
soft
dampness
of
the
air
counting
how
many
stars
i
could
see
in
the
pale
sky
watching
the
women
who
had
been
milking
the
cows
far
away
across
the
plain
come
out
of
the
dusk
towards
me
carrying
their
frothing
pails
it
must
have
been
quite
late
for
the
plain
had
risen
up
in
front
of
my
window
like
a
great
black
wall
when
i
heard
a
rattle
of
wheels
on
the
high
road
in
the
direction
of
bobbin
at
first
very
faint
it
grew
rapidly
louder
a
time
to
come
along
this
lonely
road
i
thought
and
wondered
how
it
would
be
farther
along
where
the
blackness
of
the
pines
began
but
the
cart
pulled
up
immediately
beneath
my
window
and
leaning
out
i
saw
the
light
from
the
inn
door
stream
on
to
a
green
hat
that
i
knew
and
familiar
shoulders
draped
in
waterproof
clothing
what
in
the
world
i
exclaimed
the
professor
looked
up
quickly
left
sassnitz
by
steamer
this
morning
he
cried
in
english
and
in
great
jubilation
took
a
ticket
for
arkona
i
received
full
information
in
sassnitz
and
started
at
once
this
horned
cattle
of
a
coachman
however
will
drive
me
no
farther
i
therefore
appeal
to
thee
to
take
me
on
in
thy
carriage
never
certainly
who
knows
where
she
will
go
arkona
is
miles
away
we
should
never
get
there
it
would
kill
the
horses
tut
tut
was
all
the
answer
i
got
ejected
with
a
terrific
impatience
and
much
accompanying
clinking
of
money
made
it
evident
that
the
person
described
as
horned
cattle
was
being
paid
i
turned
and
stared
at
gertrud
who
had
been
arrested
by
this
conversation
in
the
act
of
arranging
my
bed
with
a
stare
of
horror
then
in
a
flash
i
saw
which
was
the
one
safe
place
and
i
flung
myself
all
dressed
into
the
bed
down
gertrud
i
said
pulling
the
bedclothes
up
to
my
chin
say
what
you
like
to
the
professor
tell
him
i
am
in
bed
and
nothing
will
get
me
out
of
it
tell
him
i
drive
him
to
any
place
on
earth
yes
tell
him
that
tell
him
i
promise
i
promise
faithfully
to
see
him
through
go
on
and
lock
me
in
for
i
heard
a
great
clamour
on
the
stairs
and
who
knows
what
an
agitated
wise
man
may
not
do
and
afterwards
pretend
he
was
in
an
abstraction
but
i
had
definitely
pledged
myself
to
a
course
of
active
meddling
the
ninth
day
from
glowe
to
wiek
the
landlord
was
concerned
gertrud
told
me
when
he
heard
we
were
going
to
drive
to
arkona
at
an
hour
in
the
morning
known
practically
only
to
birds
professor
nieberlein
after
fuming
long
and
audibly
in
the
passage
downstairs
had
sent
her
up
with
a
request
made
in
his
hearing
that
the
carriage
might
be
at
the
door
for
that
purpose
at
four
that
hour
there
is
no
door
said
the
landlord
tut
said
the
professor
the
landlord
raised
his
hands
and
described
the
length
and
sandiness
of
the
way
then
was
all
the
professor
said
to
that
calling
after
gertrud
oh
was
my
eloquent
exclamation
when
she
came
in
and
told
me
and
i
pulled
the
bedclothes
up
still
higher
as
though
seeking
protection
in
them
from
the
blows
of
fate
is
possible
august
may
oversleep
himself
suggested
gertrud
seeing
my
speechless
objection
to
starting
for
anywhere
at
three
it
is
i
think
it
very
likely
i
said
emerging
from
the
bedclothes
to
speak
earnestly
six
i
should
think
he
would
sleep
at
till
six
should
not
you
gertrud
is
very
probable
said
gertrud
and
went
away
to
give
the
order
august
did
he
slept
so
heavily
that
eight
found
the
professor
and
myself
still
at
glowe
breakfasting
at
a
little
table
in
the
road
before
the
house
on
flounders
and
hot
gooseberry
jam
the
professor
was
much
calmer
quite
composed
in
fact
and
liked
the
flounders
which
he
said
were
as
fresh
as
young
love
he
had
been
very
tired
after
his
long
day
and
the
previous
sleepless
night
and
when
he
found
i
was
immovable
he
too
had
gone
to
bed
and
overslept
himself
immediately
on
seeing
him
in
the
morning
i
told
him
what
i
felt
sure
was
true
that
charlotte
knowing
i
would
come
to
arkona
in
the
course
of
my
drive
round
the
coast
had
gone
on
there
to
wait
for
me
there
is
really
no
hurry
i
added
certainly
not
he
said
gay
and
reasonable
after
his
good
night
will
enjoy
the
present
little
cousin
and
the
admirable
flounders
and
he
told
me
the
story
of
the
boastful
man
who
had
vaunted
the
loftiness
of
his
rooms
to
a
man
poorer
than
himself
except
in
wit
and
the
poorer
man
weary
of
this
talk
of
ceilings
was
goaded
at
last
to
relate
how
in
his
own
house
the
rooms
were
so
low
that
the
only
things
he
could
ever
have
for
meals
were
flounders
and
though
i
had
heard
the
story
before
i
took
care
to
exhibit
a
decent
mirth
in
the
proper
place
ending
by
laughing
with
all
my
heart
only
to
see
how
the
professor
laughed
and
wiped
his
eyes
it
was
a
close
day
of
sunless
heat
the
sky
was
an
intolerable
grey
glare
there
was
no
wind
and
the
flies
buzzed
in
swarms
about
the
horses
heads
as
we
drove
along
the
straight
white
road
between
the
pines
towards
arkona
gertrud
was
once
more
relegated
to
a
cart
but
she
did
not
look
nearly
so
grim
as
before
she
obviously
preferred
the
professor
to
his
wife
which
was
a
lapse
from
the
normal
discretion
of
her
manners
gertruds
not
being
supposed
to
have
preferences
and
certainly
none
that
are
obvious
from
glowe
the
high
road
goes
through
the
pines
almost
without
a
bend
to
the
next
place
juliusruh
about
an
hour
and
a
half
north
of
glowe
we
did
not
pass
a
single
house
the
way
was
absolutely
lonely
and
its
stuffiness
dreadful
we
could
see
neither
the
baltic
nor
the
bodden
though
both
were
only
a
few
yards
off
on
the
other
side
of
the
pines
at
juliusruh
a
flat
airless
place
of
new
we
did
get
a
glimpse
of
a
sea
and
after
juliusruh
the
high
road
and
the
pines
abruptly
ending
we
got
into
the
open
country
of
whose
sandiness
the
glowe
landlord
had
spoken
with
uplifted
hands
as
we
laboured
along
at
a
walking
pace
the
greyness
of
the
sky
grew
denser
and
it
began
to
rain
this
was
the
first
rain
i
had
had
during
my
journey
and
it
was
delicious
the
ripe
corn
on
our
left
looked
a
deeper
gold
against
the
dull
sky
the
ditches
were
like
streaks
of
light
they
were
so
crammed
with
yellow
flowers
the
air
grew
fragrant
with
wetness
and
best
of
all
the
dust
left
off
the
professor
put
up
his
umbrella
which
turned
out
to
be
so
enormous
when
open
that
we
could
both
sit
comfortably
under
it
and
keep
dry
and
he
was
in
such
good
spirits
at
being
fairly
on
charlotte
tracks
that
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
was
the
most
agreeable
drive
i
had
had
in
rügen
the
traveller
however
who
does
not
sit
under
one
umbrella
with
a
pleased
professor
on
the
way
to
arkona
must
not
suppose
that
he
too
will
like
this
bit
best
for
he
will
not
the
road
turns
off
sharply
inland
at
vitt
a
tiny
we
came
upon
unexpectedly
hidden
in
a
deep
clough
it
is
a
charming
little
place
a
few
fishermen
huts
a
minute
inn
and
a
great
many
walnut
trees
passing
along
the
upper
end
of
the
clough
we
looked
straight
down
its
one
shingly
street
to
the
sea
washing
among
rocks
big
black
were
hauled
up
almost
into
the
street
itself
a
forlorn
artist
umbrella
stood
all
alone
down
sheltering
an
unfinished
painting
from
the
gentle
rain
while
the
artist
i
supposed
him
to
be
the
artist
because
of
his
unique
neck
arrangements
watched
it
wistfully
from
the
inn
door
as
vitt
even
in
rain
was
perfectly
charming
i
can
confidently
recommend
it
to
the
traveller
for
on
a
sunny
day
it
must
be
quite
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
in
rügen
if
i
had
been
alone
i
would
certainly
have
stayed
there
at
least
one
night
though
the
inn
looked
as
if
its
beds
were
feather
and
its
butter
bad
but
i
now
had
a
mission
and
he
who
has
a
mission
spends
most
of
his
time
passing
the
best
things
by
not
that
a
little
paradise
i
exclaimed
the
professor
quoted
johnson
and
charles
lamb
remarking
that
he
understood
their
taste
better
than
that
of
those
persons
who
indulge
in
and
windy
raptures
about
scenery
and
the
weather
we
can
not
all
have
the
tastes
of
great
scholars
i
said
rather
coldly
for
i
did
not
like
the
expression
windy
raptures
thou
meanest
me
by
great
scholars
thou
female
babe
know
that
my
years
and
poor
rudiments
of
learning
have
served
only
to
make
it
clear
to
me
that
the
best
things
in
life
are
of
the
class
to
which
sitting
under
one
umbrella
with
a
dear
little
cousin
belong
i
endeavoured
yesterday
to
impress
this
result
of
experience
on
the
long
englishman
but
he
is
still
in
theories
and
can
not
yet
see
the
simple
and
the
close
at
hand
do
care
one
little
bit
for
the
umbrella
form
of
joy
i
said
obstinately
is
the
blankest
dulness
compared
to
the
joy
to
be
extracted
from
looking
at
a
place
like
vitt
in
fine
weather
tut
said
the
professor
not
to
me
of
weather
thou
dost
not
mean
it
from
thy
heart
and
he
arranged
the
rug
afresh
round
me
so
that
i
should
not
get
wet
and
inquired
solicitously
why
i
did
not
wear
a
waterproof
cloak
like
his
which
was
so
very
from
vitt
the
road
to
arkona
describes
a
triangle
of
which
the
village
of
putgarten
is
the
apex
and
round
which
it
took
us
half
an
hour
to
drive
we
got
to
arkona
which
consists
solely
of
a
lighthouse
with
an
inn
in
it
about
one
for
the
little
lot
cried
the
professor
leaping
out
into
the
rain
and
hastening
towards
the
emerging
landlord
while
i
hurriedly
rehearsed
the
main
points
of
my
arguments
but
charlotte
was
not
there
she
had
been
there
the
landlord
said
the
previous
afternoon
having
arrived
by
steamer
had
asked
for
a
bedroom
been
shown
one
but
had
wanted
better
accommodation
than
he
could
give
anyhow
after
drinking
coffee
she
had
hired
a
conveyance
and
had
gone
on
to
wiek
the
professor
was
terribly
crestfallen
will
go
on
then
he
said
will
at
once
proceed
to
wiek
where
wiek
is
i
conclude
we
shall
ultimately
discover
know
where
it
is
it
on
the
map
never
doubted
it
mean
i
know
the
way
from
here
i
was
going
there
anyhow
and
charlotte
knew
that
but
we
ca
go
on
yet
dear
professor
the
horses
would
never
get
us
there
it
must
be
at
least
ten
miles
off
and
awful
sand
the
whole
way
it
took
me
some
time
and
many
words
to
convince
him
that
nothing
would
make
me
move
till
the
horses
had
had
a
feed
and
a
rest
only
stay
here
a
few
hours
i
comforted
get
to
wiek
anyhow
who
can
tell
whether
she
will
be
there
two
nights
running
cried
the
professor
excitedly
striding
about
in
the
mud
we
can
when
we
get
there
and
it
no
use
bothering
till
we
are
there
but
i
sure
she
wait
till
i
come
let
us
go
in
out
of
the
rain
will
hire
a
cart
he
announced
with
great
determination
and
go
on
without
me
tell
thee
i
will
hire
a
cart
no
time
shall
be
lost
and
he
ran
back
again
to
the
landlord
who
was
watching
us
from
the
door
with
much
disapproval
for
i
suppose
charlotte
refusal
to
consider
his
accommodation
worthy
of
her
had
not
disposed
him
well
towards
her
friends
and
possibly
he
considered
the
professor
rapid
movements
among
the
puddles
too
unaccountable
to
be
nice
there
was
no
cart
he
said
absolutely
none
and
the
professor
in
a
state
of
fuming
dejection
was
forced
to
what
resignation
he
could
muster
during
this
parleying
i
had
been
sitting
alone
under
the
umbrella
the
rain
falling
monotonously
on
its
vast
surface
running
off
the
glazed
lid
of
my
yellow
bandbox
in
streams
and
dripping
from
the
brim
of
august
hat
down
his
patient
neck
a
yard
or
two
behind
sat
gertrud
on
the
dimly
visible
through
the
cloud
of
steam
rising
from
the
back
of
her
soaked
i
could
hear
the
sea
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
sluggishly
heaving
on
and
off
the
shingle
and
i
could
see
it
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
to
the
east
and
here
for
the
first
time
round
the
bend
of
the
island
to
the
north
it
was
flat
oily
and
brown
never
was
such
a
dreary
sea
or
such
a
melancholy
spot
i
got
out
and
went
into
the
house
feeling
depressed
the
landlord
led
us
into
a
room
at
the
back
the
room
in
front
being
for
the
use
of
fishermen
wishing
to
drink
clouds
of
smoke
and
a
great
clamour
smote
our
senses
when
he
opened
the
door
the
room
was
full
of
what
looked
like
an
excursion
about
thirty
people
male
and
female
sitting
at
narrow
tables
eating
chattering
singing
and
smoking
all
at
once
three
specially
variegated
young
women
dressed
in
the
flimsiest
of
clothes
all
damp
muslin
and
feathers
pretty
girls
with
pronounced
hair
arrangements
were
smoking
cigarettes
and
in
the
corner
near
the
door
demure
and
solitary
sat
another
pretty
young
woman
in
black
with
a
very
small
bonnet
trimmed
with
a
very
big
alsatian
bow
on
the
back
of
a
very
elaborately
curled
head
her
eyes
were
discreetly
fixed
on
a
wiener
schnitzel
that
she
was
eating
with
a
singular
mincingness
and
all
those
young
men
who
could
not
get
near
the
girls
in
muslin
were
doing
their
utmost
to
attract
this
one
notice
ca
stay
here
i
whispered
to
the
professor
is
too
dreadful
it
is
humanity
little
cousin
humanity
at
its
happiest
in
other
words
at
its
dinner
and
he
pulled
off
his
cloak
and
hung
up
his
hat
with
a
brisk
cheerfulness
at
which
i
who
had
just
seen
him
striding
about
among
puddles
rent
with
vexation
could
only
marvel
there
is
no
room
i
objected
is
an
ample
sufficiency
of
room
we
shall
sit
there
in
the
corner
by
the
young
lady
in
black
you
go
and
sit
there
and
i
go
out
into
that
porch
place
over
there
and
get
some
air
did
i
meet
any
one
needing
so
much
air
air
has
thou
not
then
been
aired
the
entire
morning
but
i
made
my
way
through
the
smoke
to
a
door
standing
open
at
the
other
end
that
led
into
a
little
covered
place
through
which
was
the
garden
i
put
my
head
gratefully
round
the
corner
to
breathe
the
sweet
air
the
garden
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
lighthouse
on
ground
falling
steeply
away
to
the
flat
of
the
cornfields
that
stretch
between
arkona
and
putgarten
it
is
a
pretty
place
full
of
lilies
in
flower
that
day
and
of
poplars
those
most
musical
of
trees
rough
steps
cut
in
the
side
of
the
hill
lead
down
out
of
the
garden
to
a
footpath
through
the
rye
to
putgarten
and
on
the
top
step
as
straight
and
motionless
as
the
poplars
stood
two
persons
under
umbrellas
gazing
in
silence
at
the
view
oh
unmistakable
english
backs
and
most
unmistakable
of
all
backs
the
backs
of
the
i
pulled
my
head
into
the
porch
again
with
a
wrench
and
instinctively
turned
to
flee
but
there
in
the
corner
of
the
room
sat
the
professor
and
i
could
hear
him
being
pleasant
to
the
young
person
in
the
alsatian
bow
i
did
not
choose
to
interrupt
him
for
she
was
obviously
maid
but
i
did
wonder
whether
the
bishop
had
grieved
at
all
over
the
manifest
unregeneracy
of
the
way
she
did
her
hair
hesitating
where
to
go
and
sure
of
being
ultimately
caught
wherever
i
went
i
peeped
again
in
a
sort
of
fascination
at
the
two
mackintoshed
figures
outlined
against
the
lowering
heavens
and
as
so
often
happens
the
persons
being
looked
at
turned
round
frau
you
here
too
when
did
you
arrive
in
this
terrible
place
cried
hurrying
towards
me
through
the
rain
with
outstretched
hand
and
face
made
up
of
welcome
and
commiseration
is
too
charming
to
meet
you
again
but
here
imagine
it
we
were
under
the
impression
it
was
a
place
one
could
stay
at
and
we
brought
all
our
luggage
and
left
our
comfortable
binz
for
good
it
is
impossible
to
be
in
that
room
we
were
just
considering
what
we
could
do
and
feeling
really
desperate
brosy
is
not
this
a
charming
surprise
brosy
smiled
and
said
it
was
very
charming
and
he
wished
it
would
leave
off
raining
he
supposed
i
was
only
driving
through
on
my
way
round
i
said
a
thousand
thoughts
flying
about
in
my
head
you
seen
anything
more
of
the
nieberleins
asked
shutting
her
umbrella
and
preparing
to
come
inside
the
porch
too
cousin
left
that
evening
as
you
know
i
said
i
could
not
help
wondering
began
but
was
interrupted
by
her
son
who
asked
where
i
was
going
to
sleep
that
night
think
at
wiek
i
answered
wiek
a
little
place
on
the
began
brosy
but
was
interrupted
by
his
mother
who
asked
if
the
professor
had
followed
his
wife
i
said
confess
i
was
surprised
began
but
was
interrupted
by
her
son
who
asked
whether
i
thought
lohme
possessed
an
hotel
where
one
could
stay
should
think
so
from
the
look
of
it
as
i
passed
through
i
said
began
brosy
but
was
interrupted
by
his
mother
who
asked
whether
i
had
heard
anything
of
the
dear
professor
since
he
left
genius
she
added
enthusiastically
i
said
suppose
he
and
his
wife
will
go
back
to
bonn
now
i
hope
you
say
he
had
gone
to
berlin
is
he
there
now
he
is
you
seen
him
again
he
came
back
to
stubbenkammer
with
his
wife
charlotte
was
not
with
him
never
was
a
more
expressive
indeed
cousin
changed
her
plans
about
berlin
i
said
hastily
disturbed
by
this
expressiveness
came
back
too
but
she
did
care
for
stubbenkammer
she
is
waiting
for
me
for
us
at
wiek
she
is
waiting
there
till
i
till
we
come
really
and
the
professor
professor
goes
to
wiek
too
of
course
gazed
at
me
a
moment
as
though
endeavouring
to
arrange
her
thoughts
forgive
me
she
said
seeming
stupid
but
i
do
quite
understand
where
the
professor
is
he
was
at
stubbenkammer
and
he
will
be
at
wiek
but
where
is
he
now
there
i
said
with
a
nod
in
the
direction
of
the
and
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
that
he
was
there
cried
the
bishop
wife
do
you
hear
how
very
delightful
let
us
go
to
him
at
once
and
she
rustled
into
the
room
followed
by
brosy
and
myself
go
first
dear
frau
she
turned
round
to
say
daunted
by
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
all
the
chairs
and
people
who
had
to
be
got
out
of
the
way
for
by
this
time
the
tourists
had
finished
dining
and
had
pushed
their
chairs
out
into
the
room
to
talk
together
more
conveniently
and
the
room
was
dim
with
smoke
know
where
he
is
i
ca
tell
you
how
charmed
i
am
really
most
fortunate
he
seems
to
be
with
an
english
friend
she
added
for
the
revellers
having
paused
in
their
din
to
stare
at
us
the
cheery
voice
was
distinctly
heard
inquiring
in
english
of
some
person
or
persons
unseen
whether
they
knew
the
difference
between
a
canary
and
a
grand
piano
in
such
genial
spirits
murmured
rapturously
here
there
was
a
great
obstruction
a
group
of
people
blocking
the
passage
down
the
room
and
having
to
be
got
out
of
the
way
before
we
could
pass
and
when
the
scraping
of
their
chairs
and
their
grumbles
had
ceased
we
caught
the
professor
conversation
a
little
farther
on
he
was
saying
can
not
in
that
case
my
dear
young
lady
caution
you
with
a
sufficient
earnestness
to
be
of
an
extreme
care
when
purchasing
a
grand
piano
do
ever
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
interrupted
a
shrill
female
voice
at
whose
sound
made
an
exclamation
tut
i
am
putting
a
case
suppose
you
wished
to
purchase
a
grand
piano
and
did
not
know
as
you
say
you
do
not
the
difference
between
it
sha
wish
though
i
be
a
nice
silly
to
but
suppose
you
did
wish
the
good
of
supposing
silly
things
like
that
you
a
funny
old
man
said
at
this
point
emerging
on
the
absorbed
couple
and
speaking
with
a
languid
gentleness
that
curled
slightly
upwards
into
an
interrogation
at
the
end
andrews
whose
face
had
been
overspread
by
the
expression
that
accompanies
titters
started
to
her
feet
and
froze
before
our
eyes
into
the
dumb
passivity
of
the
decent
maid
the
professor
hardly
gave
himself
time
to
bow
and
kiss
hand
before
he
poured
forth
his
pleasure
that
this
charming
young
lady
should
be
of
her
party
daughter
madam
i
doubt
not
maid
said
in
a
curdled
kind
of
voice
please
see
about
the
luggage
she
rather
a
girl
i
suppose
she
conceded
anxious
to
approve
of
all
the
professor
said
and
did
she
is
so
exceedingly
pretty
madam
that
i
could
only
conclude
she
must
be
your
daughter
this
elementary
application
of
balm
at
once
soothed
into
a
radiance
of
smiles
perplexing
in
conjunction
with
her
age
and
supposed
superiority
to
vanities
forgetful
of
her
objections
to
german
crowds
and
smoke
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
vacated
by
andrews
made
the
professor
sit
down
again
in
his
and
plunged
into
an
exuberant
conversation
which
began
by
an
invitation
so
warm
that
it
almost
seemed
on
fire
to
visit
herself
and
the
bishop
before
the
summer
was
over
in
the
episcopal
glories
of
babbacombe
this
much
i
heard
as
i
slipped
away
into
the
peace
of
the
front
room
brosy
came
after
me
to
him
the
picture
of
the
professor
being
wrapped
about
in
amenities
was
manifestly
displeasing
the
front
room
seemed
very
calm
and
spacious
after
what
we
had
just
been
in
a
few
fishermen
were
drinking
beer
at
the
bar
in
a
corner
sat
andrews
and
gertrud
beginning
a
necessarily
inarticulate
acquaintance
over
the
both
window
and
door
were
open
and
the
rain
came
down
straight
and
steady
filling
the
place
with
a
soft
murmuring
and
dampness
across
the
clearness
of
my
first
decision
that
the
professor
must
be
an
absolutely
delightful
person
to
be
always
with
had
crept
a
slight
film
of
doubt
there
were
some
things
about
him
that
might
possibly
i
began
in
a
dim
way
to
see
annoy
a
wife
he
seemed
to
love
charlotte
and
he
had
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
me
anyhow
never
before
had
i
been
so
much
patted
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
yet
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
the
alsatian
bow
he
forgot
my
presence
and
existence
forgot
the
fluster
he
had
been
in
to
get
on
after
his
wife
and
attached
himself
to
it
with
a
vehemence
that
no
one
could
be
expected
to
like
a
shadowy
conviction
began
to
pervade
my
mind
that
the
sooner
i
handed
him
over
to
charlotte
and
drove
on
again
alone
the
better
surely
charlotte
to
go
back
to
him
and
look
after
him
why
should
i
be
obliged
to
drive
round
rügen
first
with
one
nieberlein
and
then
with
the
other
ways
of
fate
are
truly
eccentric
i
remarked
half
to
myself
going
to
the
door
and
gazing
out
into
the
wet
they
have
led
you
to
arkona
on
a
rainy
day
asked
brosy
of
that
and
because
of
heaps
of
other
things
i
said
and
sitting
down
at
a
table
on
which
lay
a
bulky
tome
with
covers
i
began
rather
impatiently
to
turn
over
its
pages
but
i
had
not
yet
reached
the
limits
of
what
fate
can
and
will
do
to
a
harmless
woman
who
only
asks
to
be
left
unnoticed
for
while
brosy
and
i
were
studying
this
book
which
is
an
ancient
visitor
book
of
kept
by
the
landlord
father
or
grandfather
i
forget
which
and
quite
the
best
thing
arkona
possesses
so
that
i
advise
the
traveller
whose
welfare
i
do
my
best
at
intervals
to
promote
not
to
leave
arkona
without
having
seen
it
while
i
say
we
were
studying
this
book
admiring
many
of
its
sketches
laughing
over
the
inevitable
ineptitudes
that
seem
to
drop
with
so
surprising
a
facility
from
the
pens
of
persons
who
inscribe
their
names
examining
with
awe
the
signatures
of
celebrated
men
who
came
here
before
they
were
celebrated
bismarck
as
assessor
in
caprivi
as
lieutenant
waldersee
also
as
lieutenant
and
others
of
the
kind
while
i
repeat
we
were
innocently
studying
this
book
fate
was
busy
tucking
up
her
sleeves
preparing
to
hit
me
harder
than
ever
was
not
fate
interrupted
the
wise
relative
before
alluded
to
as
i
sat
after
my
return
recounting
my
adventures
and
trying
to
extract
sympathy
was
the
first
consequence
of
your
having
meddled
if
you
had
not
well
well
the
great
comfort
about
relatives
is
that
though
they
may
make
what
assertions
they
like
you
need
not
and
do
not
believe
them
and
it
was
fate
and
nothing
but
fate
that
had
dogged
me
malevolently
all
round
rügen
and
joined
me
here
at
arkona
once
more
to
in
she
came
while
we
were
bending
over
the
book
followed
by
the
professor
who
walked
as
a
man
may
walk
in
a
dream
his
eyes
fixed
on
nothing
and
asked
me
without
more
ado
whether
i
would
let
her
share
my
carriage
as
far
as
wiek
you
see
dear
frau
i
shall
get
there
she
observed
why
do
you
want
to
get
there
i
asked
absolutely
knocked
over
this
time
by
the
fists
of
fate
why
not
we
must
go
somewhere
and
quite
the
most
natural
thing
to
do
is
to
join
forces
you
agree
do
you
brosy
dear
the
professor
thinks
it
an
excellent
plan
and
is
charming
enough
to
want
to
relinquish
his
seat
to
me
if
you
will
have
me
are
you
not
professor
however
i
only
ask
to
be
allowed
to
sit
on
the
small
seat
for
the
last
thing
i
wish
to
do
is
to
disturb
anybody
but
i
fear
the
professor
will
not
allow
and
she
stopped
and
looked
with
arch
pleasantness
at
the
professor
who
murmured
abstractedly
certainly
which
of
course
might
mean
anything
dear
mother
began
brosy
in
a
tone
of
strong
remonstrance
i
sure
it
is
the
best
thing
we
can
do
brosy
i
did
ask
the
landlord
about
hiring
a
fly
and
there
is
no
such
thing
it
will
only
be
as
far
as
wiek
and
i
hear
that
is
not
so
very
far
you
do
mind
do
you
dear
frau
i
cried
wriggling
out
a
smile
but
how
will
your
son
i
do
quite
see
and
your
maid
brosy
has
his
bicycle
and
if
you
let
the
luggage
be
put
in
your
luggage
cart
andrews
can
quite
well
sit
beside
your
maid
of
course
we
will
share
expenses
so
that
it
will
really
be
mutually
advantageous
being
one
of
those
few
persons
who
know
exactly
what
they
want
did
as
she
chose
with
wavering
creatures
like
myself
she
also
did
as
she
chose
with
brosy
because
the
impossibility
of
publicly
rebuking
one
mother
shut
his
mouth
she
even
did
as
she
chose
with
the
professor
who
declaring
that
sooner
than
incommode
the
ladies
he
would
go
in
the
luggage
cart
was
in
the
very
act
as
we
were
preparing
to
start
off
of
nimbly
climbing
on
to
the
trunk
next
to
the
one
on
which
andrews
sat
when
he
found
himself
hesitating
coming
down
again
getting
into
the
victoria
subsiding
on
to
the
little
seat
and
all
in
obedience
to
a
clear
something
in
the
voice
of
never
did
unhappy
celebrity
sit
more
wretchedly
than
the
poor
professor
it
was
raining
so
hard
that
we
were
obliged
to
have
the
hood
up
and
its
edge
came
to
within
an
inch
of
his
nose
would
have
touched
it
quite
if
he
had
not
sat
as
straight
and
as
far
back
as
possible
he
could
not
therefore
put
up
his
umbrella
and
was
reduced
while
water
trickled
ceaselessly
off
the
hood
down
his
neck
to
pretending
with
great
heroism
that
he
was
perfectly
comfortable
it
was
impossible
to
sit
under
the
snug
hood
and
contemplate
the
drenched
professor
outside
it
it
was
impossible
to
let
an
old
man
of
seventy
and
an
old
man
besides
of
such
immense
european
value
catch
his
death
before
my
very
eyes
either
he
must
come
between
us
and
be
what
is
known
as
bodkin
or
some
one
must
get
out
and
walk
and
the
bodkin
solution
not
commending
itself
to
me
it
was
plain
that
if
some
one
walked
it
must
be
myself
in
an
instant
the
carriage
was
stopped
protestations
filled
the
air
i
got
out
the
professor
was
transferred
to
my
place
the
bishop
wife
turned
deaf
ears
to
his
entreaties
that
he
might
go
in
the
luggage
cart
and
hold
his
big
umbrella
over
the
two
poor
drowning
maids
the
hood
became
vocal
with
arguments
suggestions
expostulations
apologies
and
on
august
i
interrupted
and
dropped
behind
into
sand
and
silence
we
were
already
beyond
putgarten
in
a
flat
uninteresting
country
of
deep
sand
and
treeless
hedgeless
cornfields
i
had
no
umbrella
but
a
cloak
with
a
hood
to
it
which
i
drew
over
my
head
throwing
gertrud
my
hat
when
she
too
presently
heaved
past
in
a
cloud
of
expostulations
on
go
on
i
called
to
the
driver
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
seeing
him
hesitate
and
then
stood
waiting
for
brosy
who
was
some
little
way
behind
pushing
his
bicycle
dismally
through
the
sand
meditating
no
doubt
on
the
immense
difficulties
of
dealing
with
mothers
who
do
things
one
does
not
like
when
he
realised
that
the
solitary
figure
with
the
peaked
hood
outlined
against
the
sullen
grey
background
was
mine
he
pushed
along
at
a
trot
with
a
face
of
great
distress
but
i
had
no
difficulty
in
looking
happy
and
assuring
him
that
i
liked
walking
because
i
really
was
thankful
to
get
away
from
the
bishop
wife
and
i
rather
liked
besides
to
be
able
to
stretch
myself
thoroughly
while
as
for
getting
wet
to
let
oneself
slowly
be
soaked
to
the
skin
while
walking
in
a
warm
rain
has
a
charm
all
its
own
accordingly
after
the
preliminary
explanations
we
plodded
along
comfortably
enough
towards
wiek
keeping
the
carriage
in
sight
as
much
as
possible
and
talking
about
all
the
things
that
interested
brosy
which
were
mostly
things
of
great
obscurity
to
myself
i
suppose
he
thought
it
safest
to
keep
to
high
truths
and
generalities
fearing
lest
the
conversation
in
dropping
to
an
everyday
level
should
also
drop
on
to
the
nieberleins
and
he
seemed
quite
anxious
not
to
know
why
charlotte
was
at
wiek
by
herself
while
her
husband
and
i
were
driving
together
without
her
therefore
he
soared
carefully
in
realms
of
pure
reason
and
i
silent
and
respectful
watched
him
from
below
only
i
could
not
help
comparing
the
exalted
vagueness
of
his
talk
with
the
sharp
clearness
of
all
that
the
old
and
wise
professor
said
wiek
after
all
turned
out
to
be
hardly
more
than
five
miles
from
arkona
but
it
was
heavy
going
what
with
the
bicycle
and
my
wet
skirts
and
the
high
talk
we
got
along
slowly
and
my
soul
grew
more
chilled
with
every
step
by
the
thought
of
the
complications
the
presence
of
the
was
going
to
make
in
the
delicate
task
of
persuading
charlotte
to
return
to
her
husband
brosy
knew
very
well
that
there
was
something
unusual
in
the
nieberlein
relations
and
was
plainly
uneasy
at
being
thrust
into
a
family
meeting
when
the
red
roofs
and
poplars
of
wiek
came
in
sight
he
sank
into
thoughtfulness
and
we
walked
the
last
mile
in
our
heavy
shoes
in
almost
total
silence
the
carriage
and
cart
had
disappeared
long
ago
urged
on
no
doubt
by
the
professor
eagerness
to
get
to
charlotte
and
away
from
and
we
were
quite
near
the
first
cottages
when
august
appeared
coming
back
to
fetch
us
driving
very
fast
with
gertrud
face
peering
anxiously
round
the
hood
it
was
only
a
few
yards
from
there
to
the
open
space
in
the
middle
of
the
village
in
which
the
two
inns
are
and
brosy
got
on
his
bicycle
while
i
drove
with
gertrud
wrapped
in
all
the
rugs
she
could
muster
there
are
two
inns
at
wiek
and
one
is
the
best
the
professor
had
gone
to
each
to
inquire
for
his
wife
and
i
found
him
striding
about
in
front
of
the
one
that
is
the
best
and
i
saw
at
once
by
the
very
hang
of
his
cloak
and
position
of
his
hat
that
charlotte
was
not
there
gone
he
cried
before
the
carriage
stopped
even
this
very
day
this
very
morning
gone
at
eight
at
the
hour
we
wasted
over
those
accursed
flounders
is
it
not
sufficient
to
make
a
poor
husband
become
mad
after
months
of
patience
to
miss
her
everywhere
by
a
few
miserable
hours
i
told
thee
i
begged
thee
to
bring
me
on
last
night
brosy
now
of
a
quite
deadly
anxiety
to
keep
out
of
nieberlein
complications
removed
himself
and
his
bicycle
with
all
possible
speed
watching
my
arrival
from
an
upper
window
waved
a
genial
hand
with
cordiality
whenever
i
looked
her
way
the
landlord
and
his
wife
carried
in
all
the
rugs
that
dropped
off
me
unheeded
into
the
mud
when
i
got
out
and
did
not
visibly
turn
a
hair
at
my
peaked
hood
and
draggled
garments
has
she
gone
i
asked
as
soon
as
i
could
get
the
professor
to
keep
still
and
listen
drive
after
her
the
first
thing
morning
if
you
like
after
her
last
night
when
it
would
have
availed
thou
wouldest
not
drive
after
her
now
if
we
follow
her
we
must
swim
she
has
gone
to
an
island
an
island
i
tell
thee
of
which
i
never
till
this
day
heard
an
island
to
reach
which
requires
much
wind
from
a
favourable
quarter
which
without
wind
is
not
to
be
reached
at
all
and
in
me
thou
now
beholdest
a
man
the
tenth
day
from
wiek
to
hiddensee
the
island
to
which
charlotte
had
retired
was
the
island
of
hiddensee
a
narrow
strip
of
sand
to
the
west
of
rügen
generally
so
wordy
the
merely
mentions
it
as
a
place
to
which
it
is
possible
for
rügen
tourists
to
make
excursions
and
proffers
with
a
certain
timidity
the
information
that
pleasure
may
be
had
there
in
observing
the
life
and
habits
of
to
this
place
of
charlotte
had
gone
as
she
wrote
in
a
letter
left
with
the
landlady
for
me
because
during
the
night
she
spent
at
wiek
a
panic
had
seized
her
lest
the
should
by
some
chance
appear
there
in
their
wanderings
before
i
did
daresay
they
will
not
dream
of
coming
round
this
way
at
all
she
continued
you
never
know
you
certainly
never
know
i
agreed
being
at
that
very
moment
in
the
room
charlotte
had
had
the
panic
in
and
i
lay
awake
elaborating
a
most
beautiful
plan
by
which
i
intended
at
one
stroke
to
reunite
charlotte
and
her
husband
and
free
myself
of
both
of
them
this
plan
came
into
my
head
during
the
evening
while
sitting
sadly
listening
to
something
extremely
like
a
scolding
from
the
professor
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
done
all
in
my
power
short
of
inhumanity
to
the
horses
to
help
him
and
it
was
surely
not
my
fault
that
charlotte
had
not
happened
to
stay
anywhere
long
enough
for
us
to
catch
her
up
my
intentions
were
so
good
far
preferring
to
drive
alone
and
stop
where
and
when
i
pleased
at
vitt
for
instance
among
the
walnut
trees
i
had
yet
given
up
all
my
preferences
so
that
i
might
help
bring
man
and
wife
together
if
anything
did
not
this
conduct
incline
towards
the
noble
extreme
simplicity
amazes
me
remarked
the
wise
relative
when
arrived
at
this
part
of
my
story
on
my
return
home
i
plaintively
asked
the
above
question
no
circumstances
is
the
meddler
ever
thanked
helper
you
mean
apparently
you
would
call
every
person
who
helps
a
meddler
proceed
with
the
story
well
the
professor
who
had
suffered
much
in
the
hood
between
arkona
and
wiek
and
was
more
irritated
by
his
disappointment
on
getting
to
wiek
than
seemed
consistent
with
the
supposed
serenity
of
the
truly
wise
was
telling
me
for
the
tenth
time
that
if
i
had
brought
him
on
at
once
from
glowe
as
he
begged
me
to
do
we
would
not
only
have
escaped
the
but
would
have
caught
his
charlotte
by
now
seeing
that
she
had
not
left
wiek
for
hiddensee
till
eight
of
this
saturday
we
had
now
got
to
and
i
was
drooping
more
and
more
under
these
reproaches
when
with
the
suddenness
of
inspiration
the
beautiful
plan
flooded
my
dejected
brain
with
such
a
cheerful
light
that
i
lifted
my
head
and
laughed
in
the
professor
face
pray
tell
me
he
exclaimed
stopping
short
in
his
strides
about
the
room
thou
seest
to
laugh
at
in
my
present
condition
in
your
present
condition
it
the
glories
of
your
future
one
that
made
me
laugh
that
is
not
a
subject
on
which
one
laughs
nor
will
i
discuss
it
with
a
woman
nor
is
this
the
place
or
the
moment
i
refer
thee
and
he
swept
round
his
arm
as
though
to
sweep
me
altogether
out
of
sight
refer
thee
to
thy
pastor
professor
do
be
so
dreadfully
cross
the
future
state
i
was
thinking
of
is
further
off
than
sometimes
there
a
cunning
about
a
woman
wit
that
you
great
artists
in
profundity
possess
you
ca
of
course
because
you
are
so
busy
being
wise
on
a
large
scale
but
it
quite
useful
to
have
some
cunning
when
you
have
to
work
out
petty
schemes
and
i
tell
you
solemnly
that
at
this
moment
i
am
full
of
it
he
stopped
again
in
his
striding
the
good
landlady
and
her
one
handmaiden
were
laying
the
table
for
supper
had
gone
upstairs
to
put
on
those
evening
robes
in
which
it
appeared
she
had
nightly
astonished
the
ignorant
tourists
of
rügen
brosy
had
not
been
seen
at
all
since
our
arrival
thou
art
full
of
is
nothing
but
poking
of
fun
at
me
i
fear
said
the
professor
but
his
kind
old
face
began
to
smooth
out
a
little
not
i
only
full
of
artfulness
and
anxious
to
put
it
all
at
your
disposal
but
you
must
be
quite
so
cross
pray
am
i
no
longer
then
your
little
and
dear
cousin
thou
art
good
yes
to
pat
is
pleasant
yes
it
is
pleasant
but
if
unreasonableness
develops
with
whom
to
sit
under
one
umbrella
is
a
joy
surely
but
thou
hast
been
of
a
great
obstinacy
come
and
sit
here
and
let
us
be
happy
we
very
comfortable
here
are
we
do
let
us
think
any
more
about
the
wet
horrid
obstinate
disappointing
day
we
had
and
as
for
i
got
a
plan
the
professor
who
had
begun
to
calm
sat
down
beside
me
on
the
sofa
the
landlord
deft
and
noiseless
was
giving
a
finishing
touch
of
roses
and
fruit
and
candles
to
the
supper
table
he
had
been
a
butler
in
a
good
family
and
was
of
the
most
beautiful
dignity
and
solemnity
we
were
sitting
in
a
very
queer
old
room
used
in
past
years
for
balls
to
which
the
quality
drove
in
from
their
distant
estates
and
danced
through
winter
nights
there
was
a
gallery
for
the
fiddlers
and
the
chairs
and
benches
ranged
round
the
walls
were
still
covered
with
a
faded
red
stuff
in
the
middle
of
this
room
the
landlord
had
put
a
table
for
us
to
sup
at
and
had
arranged
it
in
a
way
i
had
not
seen
since
leaving
home
no
one
else
was
in
the
house
but
ourselves
no
one
hardly
of
the
tourist
class
comes
to
wiek
and
yet
or
because
of
it
this
inn
of
all
the
inns
i
had
stayed
at
was
in
every
way
quite
excellent
me
then
thy
plan
little
one
said
the
professor
settling
himself
comfortably
into
the
sofa
corner
it
quite
simple
you
and
i
morning
will
go
to
hiddensee
yes
but
how
it
is
sunday
and
even
if
it
were
not
no
steamers
seem
to
go
to
what
appears
to
be
a
spot
of
great
desolation
hire
a
if
there
is
no
wind
pray
for
wind
i
shall
spend
an
entire
day
within
the
cramped
limits
of
a
vessel
in
the
company
of
the
english
female
bishop
i
tell
thee
it
is
not
to
be
accomplished
no
of
course
they
must
come
too
she
will
come
if
she
wishes
to
never
did
i
meet
a
more
commanding
woman
no
we
must
circumvent
the
thou
stay
here
then
and
circumvent
then
shall
i
proceed
in
safety
on
my
way
no
i
exclaimed
in
some
consternation
the
success
of
my
plan
which
was
by
no
means
to
be
explained
in
its
entirety
to
the
professor
wholly
depended
on
my
going
too
i
want
to
see
charlotte
again
you
know
i
fond
of
charlotte
and
besides
long
before
you
got
to
hiddensee
you
would
have
sunk
into
another
abstraction
and
begun
to
fish
or
something
and
you
come
back
here
in
the
evening
with
no
charlotte
and
only
fishes
tut
well
do
i
now
know
what
is
the
object
i
have
in
view
be
so
proud
remember
pilatus
tut
thou
art
beginning
to
be
like
a
conscience
to
me
rebuking
and
urging
onwards
the
poor
old
man
in
bewildering
alternations
but
i
tell
thee
there
is
no
hope
of
setting
sail
without
the
english
madam
unless
thou
remainest
here
while
i
secretly
slip
away
wo
remain
here
i
coming
too
leave
the
arrangements
to
me
dearest
professor
and
you
see
we
secretly
slip
away
together
sweeping
in
at
that
moment
in
impressive
garments
that
trailed
our
conversation
had
to
end
abruptly
the
landlord
lit
the
candles
the
landlady
brought
in
the
soup
brosy
appeared
dressed
as
one
dresses
in
civilised
regions
up
i
whispered
to
the
professor
as
i
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
he
cheered
up
so
immediately
and
so
excessively
that
before
i
could
stop
him
before
i
could
realise
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
had
actually
chucked
me
under
the
chin
we
spent
a
constrained
evening
the
one
remark
addressed
to
me
during
the
hours
that
followed
this
was
am
altogether
at
a
loss
to
understand
frau
nieberlein
having
retired
without
her
husband
to
yet
another
island
why
this
regrettable
multiplicity
of
islands
to
which
i
could
only
answer
that
i
did
not
know
the
next
day
being
sunday
a
small
boy
went
up
into
the
wooden
belfry
of
the
church
which
was
just
opposite
my
window
and
began
to
toll
two
bells
the
belfry
is
built
separate
from
the
church
and
commands
a
view
into
the
room
of
the
inn
that
was
my
bedroom
i
could
see
the
small
boy
walking
leisurely
from
bell
to
bell
giving
each
a
pull
and
then
refreshing
himself
by
leaning
out
and
staring
hard
at
me
i
got
my
and
examined
him
with
equal
care
trying
to
stare
him
out
of
countenance
but
though
a
small
he
was
also
a
bold
boy
and
not
to
be
abashed
and
as
i
would
not
give
in
either
we
stared
at
each
other
steadily
between
the
tolls
till
nine
when
the
ceased
service
began
and
he
reluctantly
went
down
into
the
church
where
i
suppose
he
had
to
join
in
the
singing
of
the
tune
to
which
in
england
the
hymn
beginning
glory
laud
and
honour
is
sung
for
it
presently
floated
out
into
the
quiet
little
filling
it
with
the
feeling
of
sunday
while
i
lingered
at
the
window
listening
to
this
i
saw
emerge
from
the
inn
door
in
her
sunday
toque
and
crossing
the
followed
by
brosy
go
into
the
church
in
an
instant
i
had
whisked
into
my
hat
and
hurrying
downstairs
to
the
professor
who
was
strolling
up
and
down
a
path
in
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
informed
him
breathlessly
that
the
might
now
be
looked
upon
as
circumvented
already
thou
art
truly
a
wonderful
ally
he
exclaimed
in
great
glee
nothing
i
replied
modestly
as
indeed
it
was
us
start
at
once
then
he
cried
briskly
and
we
accordingly
started
slipping
out
of
the
house
and
round
the
corner
down
to
the
quay
the
sun
was
shining
the
ground
was
drying
there
was
a
slight
breeze
from
the
east
which
ought
the
landlord
said
to
blow
us
gently
to
hiddensee
if
it
kept
up
in
about
four
hours
all
my
arrangements
had
been
made
the
night
before
with
the
aid
of
august
and
gertrud
and
the
brig
quite
an
craft
that
plied
on
weather
permitting
between
wiek
and
stralsund
had
been
hired
for
the
day
at
a
cost
of
fifteen
marks
including
a
skipper
with
one
eye
and
four
able
seamen
the
brig
seemed
to
me
very
cheap
she
was
to
be
at
my
disposal
from
dawn
till
as
far
into
the
night
as
i
wanted
her
all
the
time
the
and
i
were
exchanging
increasingly
sarcastic
stares
she
was
lying
at
the
quay
ready
to
start
at
any
moment
she
had
been
chartered
in
my
name
and
for
that
one
day
she
her
skipper
and
her
four
able
seamen
belonged
entirely
to
me
gertrud
was
waiting
on
board
and
had
arranged
a
sort
of
nest
of
rugs
and
cushions
for
me
the
landlady
and
her
servant
were
also
there
with
a
basket
of
cakes
and
cherries
out
of
the
inn
garden
this
landlady
by
the
way
was
quite
ideal
her
one
aim
seemed
to
be
to
do
things
like
baking
cakes
for
her
visitors
and
not
putting
them
in
the
bill
i
met
nothing
else
at
all
like
her
or
her
husband
on
my
journey
round
rügen
or
anywhere
else
their
simple
kindness
shall
not
go
unsung
and
therefore
do
i
pause
here
with
one
foot
on
the
quay
and
the
other
on
the
brig
to
sing
it
but
indeed
the
traveller
who
does
not
yearn
for
waiters
and
has
no
prejudices
against
crawling
up
a
staircase
so
steep
that
it
is
practically
a
ladder
when
he
wants
to
go
to
bed
who
loves
quiet
is
not
insensible
to
the
charms
of
good
cooking
and
thinks
bathing
and
sailing
agreeable
pastimes
could
be
extremely
happy
at
a
very
small
cost
at
wiek
and
when
all
other
pleasures
are
exhausted
he
can
hire
the
and
go
to
hiddensee
and
study
takest
the
excellent
but
unprepossessing
gertrud
with
thee
inquired
the
professor
in
a
slightly
displeased
voice
seeing
her
immovable
and
the
sails
being
hoisted
i
do
like
being
sick
without
her
there
will
hardly
be
a
sufficiency
of
wind
for
the
needs
of
the
vessel
how
wilt
thou
be
sick
in
a
calm
can
i
tell
till
i
have
tried
oh
gay
voyage
down
the
wieker
bodden
over
the
little
dancing
waves
under
the
serene
summer
sky
oh
blessed
change
from
the
creaking
of
a
carriage
through
dust
to
rippling
silence
and
freshness
the
professor
was
in
such
spirits
that
he
could
hardly
be
kept
from
doing
what
he
called
manning
the
yards
and
had
to
be
fetched
down
when
he
began
to
clamber
by
the
alarmed
skipper
gertrud
sat
watching
for
the
first
glimpse
of
our
destination
with
the
intentness
of
a
second
brangäne
the
wind
could
hardly
be
said
to
blow
us
along
it
was
so
very
gentle
but
it
did
waft
us
along
smoothly
and
steadily
and
wiek
slipped
into
distance
and
its
bells
into
silence
and
the
occasional
solitary
farms
on
the
flat
shores
slid
away
one
after
the
other
and
the
farthest
point
ahead
came
to
meet
us
dropped
astern
became
the
farthest
point
behind
and
we
were
far
on
our
way
while
we
were
thinking
we
could
hardly
be
moving
the
reader
who
looks
at
the
map
will
see
the
course
we
took
and
how
with
that
gentle
wind
it
came
to
be
nearly
twelve
before
we
rounded
the
corner
of
the
wieker
bodden
passed
a
sandbank
crowded
with
hundreds
of
and
headed
for
the
northern
end
of
hiddensee
hiddensee
lay
stretched
out
from
north
to
south
long
and
narrow
like
a
lizard
lying
in
the
sun
it
is
absolutely
flat
a
mere
sandbank
except
at
the
northern
end
where
it
swells
up
into
hills
and
a
lighthouse
there
are
only
two
villages
on
it
with
inns
the
one
called
vitte
built
on
a
strip
of
sand
so
low
so
level
with
the
sea
that
it
looks
as
if
an
extra
big
wave
or
indeed
any
wave
must
wash
right
over
it
and
clean
it
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
other
called
kloster
where
charlotte
was
i
observe
that
on
the
map
kloster
is
printed
in
large
letters
as
though
it
were
a
place
of
some
importance
it
is
a
very
pretty
very
small
handful
of
fishermen
cottages
one
little
line
of
them
in
a
green
nest
of
rushes
and
willows
along
the
water
edge
with
a
hill
at
the
back
and
some
way
up
the
hill
a
small
dilapidated
church
forlorn
and
spireless
in
a
churchyard
bare
of
trees
we
dropped
anchor
in
the
glassy
bay
about
two
the
last
bit
of
the
vitter
bodden
having
been
slow
almost
windless
work
and
were
rowed
ashore
in
a
dinghy
there
not
being
enough
water
within
a
hundred
yards
to
float
so
majestic
a
craft
as
the
the
skipper
leaned
over
the
side
of
his
brig
watching
us
go
and
wishing
us
the
dinghy
and
the
two
rowers
were
to
wait
at
the
little
till
such
time
as
we
should
want
them
again
gertrud
came
with
us
carrying
the
landlady
basket
of
food
more
thou
takest
the
excellent
but
unprepossessing
gertrud
with
thee
inquired
the
professor
with
increased
displeasure
to
carry
the
cakes
tut
and
he
muttered
something
that
sounded
irritable
about
the
having
strewn
the
world
with
so
many
plain
women
is
the
time
to
bother
about
plain
women
i
said
you
feel
in
every
fibre
that
you
are
within
a
stone
throw
of
your
charlotte
i
am
sure
we
have
caught
her
this
time
for
a
moment
he
had
forgotten
charlotte
and
all
his
face
grew
radiant
at
the
reminder
with
the
alacrity
of
eighteen
he
leapt
ashore
and
we
hurried
along
a
narrow
rushy
path
at
the
water
edge
to
the
one
inn
a
small
cottage
of
the
simplest
sort
overlooking
green
fields
and
placid
water
a
trim
servant
in
sunday
raiment
was
clearing
away
coffee
cups
from
a
table
in
the
tiny
front
garden
and
of
her
we
asked
with
some
trembling
after
our
many
disappointments
whether
frau
nieberlein
were
there
yes
she
was
staying
there
but
had
gone
up
on
to
the
downs
after
dinner
in
which
direction
past
the
church
up
the
lighthouse
way
the
professor
darted
off
before
she
had
done
i
hastened
after
him
gertrud
waited
at
the
inn
with
my
own
eyes
i
wished
to
see
that
he
actually
did
meet
charlotte
for
the
least
thing
would
make
him
forget
what
he
had
come
for
and
so
nimble
was
he
so
winged
with
love
that
i
had
to
make
desperate
and
panting
efforts
to
get
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
as
soon
as
he
did
up
we
sped
in
silence
past
the
bleak
churchyard
on
to
what
turned
out
to
be
the
most
glorious
downs
on
the
top
the
professor
stopped
a
moment
to
wipe
his
forehead
and
looking
back
for
the
first
time
i
was
absolutely
startled
by
the
loveliness
of
the
view
the
shining
bodden
with
its
bays
and
little
islands
lay
beneath
us
to
the
north
was
the
sea
to
the
west
the
sea
to
the
east
right
away
on
the
other
side
of
distant
rügen
the
sea
far
in
the
south
rose
the
towers
of
stralsund
close
behind
us
a
forest
of
young
pines
filled
the
air
with
warm
waves
of
fragrance
at
our
feet
the
turf
was
thick
with
flowers
oh
wide
and
splendid
world
how
good
it
is
to
look
sometimes
across
great
spaces
to
lift
one
eyes
from
narrowness
to
feel
the
large
silence
that
rests
on
lonely
hills
motionless
we
stood
before
this
sudden
unrolling
of
the
beauty
of
god
earth
the
place
seemed
full
of
a
serene
and
mighty
presence
far
up
near
the
clouds
a
solitary
lark
was
singing
its
joys
there
was
no
other
sound
i
believe
if
i
had
not
been
with
him
the
professor
would
again
have
forgotten
charlotte
and
lying
down
on
the
flowery
turf
with
his
eyes
on
that
most
beautiful
of
views
have
given
himself
over
to
abstractions
but
i
stopped
him
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
preparing
to
sink
to
the
ground
no
i
besought
sit
down
sit
and
why
then
shall
not
a
warm
old
man
sit
let
us
find
charlotte
at
the
bare
mention
of
the
name
he
began
to
run
the
inn
servant
had
said
charlotte
had
gone
up
to
the
lighthouse
from
where
we
were
we
could
not
see
it
but
hurrying
through
a
corner
of
the
we
came
out
on
the
north
end
of
hiddensee
and
there
it
was
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
then
my
heart
began
to
beat
with
mingled
feelings
exultation
that
i
should
be
on
the
verge
of
doing
so
much
good
fear
lest
my
plan
by
some
fatal
mishap
should
be
spoilt
or
if
it
succeeded
my
actions
be
misjudged
a
moment
i
murmured
faintly
laying
a
trembling
hand
on
the
professor
arm
professor
wait
a
moment
charlotte
must
be
quite
close
now
i
do
want
to
intrude
on
you
both
at
first
so
please
will
you
give
her
this
letter
and
i
pulled
it
with
great
difficulty
it
being
fat
and
my
fingers
shaky
out
of
my
pocket
the
eloquent
letter
i
had
written
in
the
dawn
at
stubbenkammer
and
pressed
it
into
his
hand
it
to
her
with
my
love
with
my
very
dear
love
yes
said
the
professor
impatient
of
these
speeches
and
only
desirous
of
getting
on
he
crushed
the
letter
unquestioningly
into
his
pocket
and
we
resumed
our
hurried
walking
the
footpath
led
us
across
a
flowery
slope
ending
in
a
cliff
that
dropped
down
on
the
sunset
side
of
the
island
to
the
sea
we
had
not
gone
many
yards
before
we
saw
a
single
figure
sitting
on
this
slope
its
back
to
us
its
slightly
dejected
head
and
shoulders
appearing
above
the
crowd
of
scabious
harebells
and
through
whose
frail
loveliness
flashed
the
shimmering
sea
it
was
charlotte
i
seized
the
professor
hand
there
she
is
i
whispered
in
great
excitement
holding
him
back
for
one
instant
me
time
to
get
out
of
sight
do
forget
the
letter
let
me
get
into
the
wood
first
and
then
go
to
her
now
all
blessings
be
with
thee
dearest
professor
good
luck
to
you
both
you
see
how
happy
you
both
are
going
to
be
and
wringing
his
hand
with
a
fervour
that
evidently
surprised
him
i
turned
and
fled
oh
how
i
fled
never
have
i
run
so
fast
with
such
a
nightmare
feeling
of
covering
no
ground
back
through
the
wood
out
on
the
other
side
straight
as
an
arrow
down
the
hill
towards
the
bodden
taking
the
shortest
cut
over
the
turf
to
kloster
oh
how
i
ran
it
makes
me
breathless
now
to
think
of
it
as
if
pursued
by
demons
i
ran
not
daring
to
look
back
not
daring
to
stop
and
gasp
away
i
flew
past
the
church
past
the
parson
who
i
remember
stared
at
me
aghast
over
his
garden
wall
past
the
willows
past
the
rushes
down
to
the
and
gertrud
everything
was
ready
i
had
given
the
strictest
private
instructions
and
dropping
speechless
into
the
dinghy
a
palpitating
mixture
of
heat
anxiety
and
rapture
was
rowed
as
fast
as
two
strong
men
could
row
me
to
the
brig
and
the
waiting
skipper
the
wind
was
terribly
light
the
water
terribly
glassy
at
first
i
lay
in
a
quivering
heap
on
the
cushions
hardly
daring
to
think
we
were
not
moving
hardly
daring
to
remember
how
i
had
seen
a
small
boat
tied
to
a
stake
in
front
of
the
inn
and
that
if
the
did
not
get
away
soon
then
fortune
smiled
on
the
doer
of
good
a
gentle
puff
filled
the
sails
there
was
a
distinct
rippling
across
the
bows
it
increased
to
a
gurgle
and
kloster
with
its
willows
its
downs
its
one
inn
and
its
impossibility
of
being
got
out
of
silently
withdrew
into
shadows
then
did
i
stretch
myself
out
on
my
rugs
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
allow
gertrud
to
fuss
over
me
never
have
i
felt
so
nice
so
kind
so
exactly
like
a
ministering
angel
how
grateful
the
dear
old
professor
would
be
and
charlotte
too
when
she
had
read
my
letter
and
listened
to
all
he
had
to
say
she
would
have
to
listen
she
would
be
able
to
help
herself
and
there
would
be
heaps
of
time
i
laughed
aloud
for
joy
at
the
success
of
my
plan
there
they
were
on
that
tiny
island
and
there
they
would
have
to
stay
at
least
till
probably
longer
perhaps
they
would
get
so
fond
of
it
that
they
would
stay
on
there
indefinitely
anyhow
i
had
certainly
reunited
them
reunited
them
and
freed
myself
emphatically
this
was
one
of
those
good
actions
that
blesses
him
who
acts
and
him
who
is
acted
upon
and
never
did
glow
with
a
warmer
consciousness
of
having
done
well
than
i
glowed
as
i
lay
on
the
deck
of
the
watching
the
in
great
comfort
and
eating
not
only
my
own
cherries
but
the
professor
as
well
all
the
way
up
the
wieker
bodden
we
had
to
tack
hour
after
hour
we
tacked
and
seemed
to
get
no
nearer
home
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
evening
came
and
still
we
tacked
the
sun
set
gloriously
the
moon
came
up
the
sea
was
a
deep
violet
the
clouds
in
the
eastern
sky
about
the
moon
shone
with
a
pearly
whiteness
the
clouds
in
the
west
were
gorgeous
past
belief
flaming
across
in
marvellous
colours
even
to
us
the
light
reflected
from
them
transfiguring
our
sails
our
men
our
whole
boat
into
a
spirit
ship
of
an
unearthly
radiance
bound
for
elysium
manned
by
immortal
gods
look
now
how
colour
the
soul
bridegroom
makes
the
house
of
heaven
splendid
for
the
bride
i
quoted
awestruck
watching
this
vast
plain
of
light
with
clasped
hands
and
rapt
spirit
it
was
a
solemn
and
magnificent
close
to
my
journey
the
eleventh
day
from
wiek
home
the
traveller
in
whose
interests
i
began
this
book
and
who
has
so
frequently
been
forgotten
during
the
writing
of
it
might
very
well
protest
here
that
i
have
not
yet
been
all
round
rügen
and
should
not
therefore
talk
of
closes
to
my
journey
but
nothing
that
the
traveller
can
say
will
keep
me
from
going
home
in
this
chapter
i
did
go
home
on
the
morning
of
the
eleventh
day
driving
from
wiek
to
bergen
and
taking
the
train
from
there
and
the
red
line
on
the
map
will
show
that
except
for
one
dull
corner
in
the
i
had
practically
carried
out
my
original
plan
and
really
had
driven
all
round
the
island
reaching
the
inn
at
wiek
at
ten
on
the
sunday
night
i
went
straight
and
very
softly
to
bed
and
leaving
the
inn
at
wiek
at
eight
on
the
monday
morning
i
might
have
got
away
without
ever
seeing
again
if
the
remembrance
of
brosy
unvarying
kindness
had
not
stirred
me
to
send
gertrud
up
with
a
farewell
message
having
heard
all
about
my
day
on
the
from
the
landlady
and
how
i
had
come
back
in
the
unimpeachability
of
singleness
the
professor
safely
handed
over
to
his
wife
forgave
the
forgave
the
secret
setting
out
and
hurried
on
to
the
landing
in
a
wrapper
warmth
in
her
heart
and
honey
on
her
lips
you
are
leaving
us
dear
frau
she
called
over
the
baluster
early
so
suddenly
i
ca
come
down
to
you
do
come
up
here
did
you
tell
me
you
were
going
she
continued
when
i
had
come
up
holding
my
hand
in
both
hers
speaking
with
emphatic
cordiality
an
altogether
melted
and
mellifluous
bishop
wife
had
quite
decided
i
fear
i
must
go
home
they
want
me
badly
i
can
understand
of
course
they
want
their
little
ray
of
sunshine
she
cried
growing
more
and
more
mellifluous
tell
me
she
went
on
stroking
the
hand
she
held
are
you
coming
to
see
us
all
at
babbacombe
babbacombe
heavens
when
indeed
never
never
never
shrieked
my
soul
thanks
murmured
my
lips
kind
you
are
but
do
you
think
the
bishop
would
like
me
bishop
he
would
more
than
like
you
dear
frau
he
would
positively
glory
in
you
in
me
i
faintly
gasped
and
a
gaudy
vision
of
the
bishop
glorying
that
bishop
of
whom
i
had
been
taught
to
think
as
steeped
in
chronic
sorrow
swam
before
my
dazzled
eyes
kind
you
are
but
afraid
you
are
too
kind
i
afraid
he
would
soon
see
there
anything
to
make
him
glory
and
much
to
make
him
grieve
well
we
must
be
so
modest
of
course
the
bishop
knows
we
are
all
human
and
so
must
have
our
little
faults
but
i
can
assure
you
he
would
be
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
is
a
most
man
now
i
murmured
confused
thanks
and
tried
to
draw
my
hand
away
but
it
was
held
tight
shall
miss
the
midday
train
at
bergen
if
i
do
go
at
once
i
appealed
really
must
go
long
to
be
with
all
your
dear
ones
again
i
am
sure
i
do
catch
this
train
i
shall
not
get
home
i
really
must
go
home
how
charming
your
home
must
be
one
hears
so
much
about
the
charming
german
but
unfortunately
just
travelling
through
the
country
one
gets
no
chance
of
a
peep
into
it
i
have
felt
that
myself
in
other
countries
i
absolutely
must
run
and
tearing
my
hand
away
with
the
energy
of
panic
i
got
down
the
ladder
as
quickly
as
i
could
without
actually
sliding
for
i
knew
that
in
another
moment
the
bishop
wife
would
have
invited
herself
oh
it
did
not
bear
thinking
of
the
nieberleins
she
called
over
the
baluster
suddenly
remembering
them
on
an
island
quite
inaccessible
in
this
wind
a
mere
desert
only
and
one
is
sick
getting
to
it
do
they
not
return
here
she
called
still
louder
for
i
was
through
the
door
now
and
out
on
the
path
no
stralsund
berlin
bonn
the
landlord
and
his
wife
were
waiting
outside
the
landlady
with
a
great
bunch
of
roses
and
yet
another
basket
of
cakes
brosy
was
there
too
and
helped
me
into
the
carriage
frightfully
sorry
you
are
going
he
said
am
i
but
one
must
ultimately
go
observe
the
eternal
truth
lurking
in
that
sentence
if
ever
you
are
wandering
about
germany
alone
do
come
and
see
us
should
love
to
and
thus
with
mutual
amenities
brosy
and
i
parted
so
ended
my
journey
round
rügen
for
there
is
nothing
to
be
recorded
of
that
last
drive
to
the
railway
station
at
bergen
except
that
it
was
flat
and
we
saw
the
jagdschloss
in
the
distance
at
the
station
i
bade
farewell
to
the
carriage
in
which
i
had
sometimes
suffered
and
often
been
happy
for
august
stayed
that
night
in
bergen
and
brought
the
horses
home
next
day
and
presently
the
train
appeared
and
swept
up
gertrud
and
myself
and
rügen
knew
us
no
more
but
before
i
part
from
the
traveller
who
ought
by
this
time
to
be
very
tired
i
will
present
him
with
the
following
condensed
experiences
the
nicest
bathing
was
at
lauterbach
the
best
inn
was
at
wiek
i
was
happiest
at
lauterbach
and
wiek
i
was
most
wretched
at
göhren
the
cheapest
place
was
thiessow
the
dearest
place
was
stubbenkammer
the
most
beautiful
place
was
hiddensee
and
perhaps
he
may
like
to
know
too
though
it
really
is
no
business
of
his
what
became
of
the
nieberleins
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
had
letters
from
them
both
of
a
nature
that
positively
prohibits
publication
and
a
mutual
acquaintance
told
me
that
charlotte
had
applied
for
a
judicial
separation
when
i
heard
it
i
was
thunderstruck
the
end
