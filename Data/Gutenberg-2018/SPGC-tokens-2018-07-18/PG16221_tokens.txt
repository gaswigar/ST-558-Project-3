chapter
i
youth
in
the
city
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
each
generation
longs
for
a
reassurance
as
to
the
value
and
charm
of
life
and
is
secretly
afraid
lest
it
lose
its
sense
of
the
youth
of
the
earth
this
is
doubtless
one
reason
why
it
so
passionately
cherishes
its
poets
and
artists
who
have
been
able
to
explore
for
themselves
and
to
reveal
to
others
the
perpetual
springs
of
life
and
yet
the
average
man
can
not
obtain
this
desired
reassurance
through
literature
nor
yet
through
glimpses
of
earth
and
sky
it
can
come
to
him
only
through
the
chance
embodiment
of
joy
and
youth
which
life
itself
may
throw
in
his
way
it
is
doubtless
true
that
for
the
mass
of
men
the
message
is
never
so
unchallenged
and
so
invincible
as
when
embodied
in
youth
itself
one
generation
after
another
has
depended
upon
its
young
to
equip
it
with
gaiety
and
enthusiasm
to
persuade
it
that
living
is
a
pleasure
until
men
everywhere
have
anxiously
provided
channels
through
which
this
wine
of
life
might
flow
and
be
preserved
for
their
delight
the
classical
city
promoted
play
with
careful
solicitude
building
the
theater
and
stadium
as
it
built
the
market
place
and
the
temple
the
greeks
held
their
games
so
integral
a
part
of
religion
and
patriotism
that
they
came
to
expect
from
their
poets
the
highest
utterances
at
the
very
moments
when
the
sense
of
pleasure
released
the
national
life
in
the
medieval
city
the
knights
held
their
tourneys
the
guilds
their
pageants
the
people
their
dances
and
the
church
made
festival
for
its
most
cherished
saints
with
gay
street
processions
and
presented
a
drama
in
which
no
less
a
theme
than
the
history
of
creation
became
a
matter
of
thrilling
interest
only
in
the
modern
city
have
men
concluded
that
it
is
no
longer
necessary
for
the
municipality
to
provide
for
the
insatiable
desire
for
play
in
so
far
as
they
have
acted
upon
this
conclusion
they
have
entered
upon
a
most
difficult
and
dangerous
experiment
and
this
at
the
very
moment
when
the
city
has
become
distinctly
industrial
and
daily
labor
is
continually
more
monotonous
and
subdivided
we
forget
how
new
the
modern
city
is
and
how
short
the
span
of
time
in
which
we
have
assumed
that
we
can
eliminate
public
provision
for
recreation
a
further
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
industrialism
has
gathered
together
multitudes
of
eager
young
creatures
from
all
quarters
of
the
earth
as
a
labor
supply
for
the
countless
factories
and
workshops
upon
which
the
present
industrial
city
is
based
never
before
in
civilization
have
such
numbers
of
young
girls
been
suddenly
released
from
the
protection
of
the
home
and
permitted
to
walk
unattended
upon
city
streets
and
to
work
under
alien
roofs
for
the
first
time
they
are
being
prized
more
for
their
labor
power
than
for
their
innocence
their
tender
beauty
their
ephemeral
gaiety
society
cares
more
for
the
products
they
manufacture
than
for
their
immemorial
ability
to
reaffirm
the
charm
of
existence
never
before
have
such
numbers
of
young
boys
earned
money
independently
of
the
family
life
and
felt
themselves
free
to
spend
it
as
they
choose
in
the
midst
of
vice
deliberately
disguised
as
pleasure
this
stupid
experiment
of
organizing
work
and
failing
to
organize
play
has
of
course
brought
about
a
fine
revenge
the
love
of
pleasure
will
not
be
denied
and
when
it
has
turned
into
all
sorts
of
malignant
and
vicious
appetites
then
we
the
middle
aged
grow
quite
distracted
and
resort
to
all
sorts
of
restrictive
measures
we
even
try
to
dam
up
the
sweet
fountain
itself
because
we
are
affrighted
by
these
neglected
streams
but
almost
worse
than
the
restrictive
measures
is
our
apparent
belief
that
the
city
itself
has
no
obligation
in
the
matter
an
assumption
upon
which
the
modern
city
turns
over
to
commercialism
practically
all
the
provisions
for
public
recreation
quite
as
one
set
of
men
has
organized
the
young
people
into
industrial
enterprises
in
order
to
profit
from
their
toil
so
another
set
of
men
and
also
of
women
i
am
sorry
to
say
have
entered
the
neglected
field
of
recreation
and
have
organized
enterprises
which
make
profit
out
of
this
invincible
love
of
pleasure
in
every
city
arise
places
they
are
called
in
fiction
in
chicago
we
euphemistically
say
merely
places
in
which
alcohol
is
dispensed
not
to
allay
thirst
but
ostensibly
to
stimulate
gaiety
it
is
sold
really
in
order
to
empty
pockets
huge
dance
halls
are
opened
to
which
hundreds
of
young
people
are
attracted
many
of
whom
stand
wistfully
outside
a
roped
circle
for
it
requires
five
cents
to
procure
within
it
for
five
minutes
the
sense
of
allurement
and
intoxication
which
is
sold
in
lieu
of
innocent
pleasure
these
coarse
and
illicit
merrymakings
remind
one
of
the
unrestrained
jollities
of
restoration
london
and
they
are
indeed
their
direct
descendants
properly
commercialized
still
confusing
joy
with
lust
and
gaiety
with
debauchery
since
the
soldiers
of
cromwell
shut
up
the
people
playhouses
and
destroyed
their
pleasure
fields
the
city
has
turned
over
the
provision
for
public
recreation
to
the
most
and
the
most
unscrupulous
members
of
the
community
we
see
thousands
of
girls
walking
up
and
down
the
streets
on
a
pleasant
evening
with
no
chance
to
catch
a
sight
of
pleasure
even
through
a
lighted
window
save
as
these
lurid
places
provide
it
apparently
the
modern
city
sees
in
these
girls
only
two
possibilities
both
of
them
commercial
first
a
chance
to
utilize
by
day
their
new
and
tender
labor
power
in
its
factories
and
shops
and
then
another
chance
in
the
evening
to
extract
from
them
their
petty
wages
by
pandering
to
their
love
of
pleasure
as
these
overworked
girls
stream
along
the
street
the
rest
of
us
see
only
the
walk
the
giggling
speech
the
preposterous
clothing
and
yet
through
the
huge
hat
with
its
wilderness
of
bedraggled
feathers
the
girl
announces
to
the
world
that
she
is
here
she
demands
attention
to
the
fact
of
her
existence
she
states
that
she
is
ready
to
live
to
take
her
place
in
the
world
the
most
precious
moment
in
human
development
is
the
young
creature
assertion
that
he
is
unlike
any
other
human
being
and
has
an
individual
contribution
to
make
to
the
world
the
variation
from
the
established
type
is
at
the
root
of
all
change
the
only
possible
basis
for
progress
all
that
keeps
life
from
growing
unprofitably
stale
and
repetitious
is
it
only
the
artists
who
really
see
these
young
creatures
as
they
are
the
artists
who
are
themselves
endowed
with
immortal
youth
is
it
our
disregard
of
the
artist
message
which
makes
us
so
blind
and
so
stupid
or
are
we
so
under
the
influence
of
our
that
we
can
detect
only
commercial
values
in
the
young
as
well
as
in
the
old
it
is
as
if
our
eyes
were
holden
to
the
mystic
beauty
the
redemptive
joy
the
civic
pride
which
these
multitudes
of
young
people
might
supply
to
our
dingy
towns
the
young
creatures
themselves
piteously
look
all
about
them
in
order
to
find
an
adequate
means
of
expression
for
their
most
precious
message
one
day
a
serious
young
man
came
to
with
his
pretty
young
sister
who
he
explained
wanted
to
go
somewhere
every
single
evening
although
she
could
only
give
the
flimsy
excuse
that
the
flat
was
too
little
and
too
stuffy
to
stay
in
in
the
difficult
r√¥le
of
elder
brother
he
had
done
his
best
stating
that
he
had
taken
her
to
all
the
missions
in
the
neighborhood
that
she
had
had
a
chance
to
listen
to
some
awful
good
sermons
and
to
some
elegant
hymns
but
that
some
way
she
did
not
seem
to
care
for
the
society
of
the
best
christian
people
the
little
sister
reddened
painfully
under
this
cruel
indictment
and
could
offer
no
word
of
excuse
but
a
curious
thing
happened
to
me
perhaps
it
was
the
phrase
the
best
christian
people
perhaps
it
was
the
delicate
color
of
her
flushing
cheeks
and
her
swimming
eyes
but
certain
it
is
that
instantly
and
vividly
there
appeared
to
my
mind
the
delicately
tinted
piece
of
wall
in
a
roman
catacomb
where
the
early
christians
through
a
dozen
devices
of
spring
flowers
skipping
lambs
and
a
shepherd
tenderly
guiding
the
young
had
indelibly
written
down
that
the
christian
message
is
one
of
inexpressible
joy
who
is
responsible
for
forgetting
this
message
delivered
by
the
best
christian
people
two
thousand
years
ago
who
is
to
blame
that
the
lambs
the
little
ewe
lambs
have
been
so
caught
upon
the
brambles
but
quite
as
the
modern
city
wastes
this
most
valuable
moment
in
the
life
of
the
girl
and
drives
into
all
sorts
of
absurd
and
obscure
expressions
her
love
and
yearning
towards
the
world
in
which
she
forecasts
her
destiny
so
it
often
drives
the
boy
into
gambling
and
drinking
in
order
to
find
his
adventure
of
lincoln
enlistment
of
two
and
a
half
million
soldiers
a
very
large
number
were
under
some
of
them
under
eighteen
and
still
others
were
mere
children
under
fifteen
even
in
those
stirring
times
when
patriotism
and
high
resolve
were
at
the
flood
no
one
responded
as
did
the
boys
and
the
great
soul
who
yearned
over
them
who
refused
to
shoot
the
sentinels
who
slept
the
sleep
of
childhood
knew
as
no
one
else
knew
the
precious
glowing
stuff
of
which
his
army
was
made
but
what
of
the
millions
of
boys
who
are
now
searching
for
adventurous
action
longing
to
fulfil
the
same
high
purpose
one
of
the
most
pathetic
sights
in
the
public
dance
halls
of
chicago
is
the
number
of
young
men
obviously
honest
young
fellows
from
the
country
who
stand
about
vainly
hoping
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
some
nice
girl
they
look
eagerly
up
and
down
the
rows
of
girls
many
of
whom
are
drawn
to
the
hall
by
the
same
keen
desire
for
pleasure
and
social
intercourse
which
the
lonely
young
men
themselves
feel
one
sunday
night
at
twelve
i
had
occasion
to
go
into
a
large
public
dance
hall
as
i
was
standing
by
the
rail
looking
for
the
girl
i
had
come
to
find
a
young
man
approached
me
and
quite
simply
asked
me
to
introduce
him
to
some
nice
girl
saying
that
he
did
not
know
any
one
there
on
my
replying
that
a
public
dance
hall
was
not
the
best
place
in
which
to
look
for
a
nice
girl
he
said
but
i
know
any
other
place
where
there
is
a
chance
to
meet
any
kind
of
a
girl
i
awfully
lonesome
since
i
came
to
chicago
and
then
he
added
rather
defiantly
some
nice
girls
do
come
here
it
one
of
the
best
halls
in
town
he
was
voicing
the
bitter
loneliness
that
many
city
men
remember
to
have
experienced
during
the
first
years
after
they
had
come
up
to
town
occasionally
the
right
sort
of
man
and
girl
meet
each
other
in
these
dance
halls
and
the
romance
with
such
a
tawdry
beginning
ends
happily
and
respectably
but
unfortunately
mingled
with
the
respectable
young
men
seeking
to
form
the
acquaintance
of
young
women
through
the
only
channel
which
is
available
to
them
are
many
young
fellows
of
evil
purpose
and
among
the
girls
who
have
left
their
lonely
boarding
houses
or
rigid
homes
for
a
little
fling
are
likewise
women
who
openly
desire
to
make
money
from
the
young
men
whom
they
meet
and
back
of
it
all
is
the
desire
to
profit
by
the
sale
of
intoxicating
and
doctored
drinks
perhaps
never
before
have
the
pleasures
of
the
young
and
mature
become
so
definitely
separated
as
in
the
modern
city
the
public
dance
halls
filled
with
frivolous
and
irresponsible
young
people
in
a
feverish
search
for
pleasure
are
but
a
sorry
substitute
for
the
old
dances
on
the
village
green
in
which
all
of
the
older
people
of
the
village
participated
chaperonage
was
not
then
a
social
duty
but
natural
and
inevitable
and
the
whole
courtship
period
was
guarded
by
the
conventions
and
restraint
which
were
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
had
developed
through
years
of
publicity
and
simple
propriety
the
only
marvel
is
that
the
stupid
attempt
to
put
the
fine
old
wine
of
traditional
country
life
into
the
new
bottles
of
the
modern
town
does
not
lead
to
disaster
oftener
than
it
does
and
that
the
wine
so
long
remains
pure
and
sparkling
we
can
not
afford
to
be
ungenerous
to
the
city
in
which
we
live
without
suffering
the
penalty
which
lack
of
fair
interpretation
always
entails
let
us
know
the
modern
city
in
its
weakness
and
wickedness
and
then
seek
to
rectify
and
purify
it
until
it
shall
be
free
at
least
from
the
grosser
temptations
which
now
beset
the
young
people
who
are
living
in
its
tenement
houses
and
working
in
its
factories
the
mass
of
these
young
people
are
possessed
of
good
intentions
and
they
are
equipped
with
a
certain
understanding
of
city
life
this
itself
could
be
made
a
most
valuable
social
instrument
toward
securing
innocent
recreation
and
better
social
organization
they
are
already
serving
the
city
in
so
far
as
it
is
honeycombed
with
mutual
benefit
societies
with
pleasure
clubs
with
organizations
connected
with
churches
and
factories
which
are
filling
a
genuine
social
need
and
yet
the
whole
apparatus
for
supplying
pleasure
is
wretchedly
inadequate
and
full
of
danger
to
whomsoever
may
approach
it
who
is
responsible
for
its
inadequacy
and
dangers
we
certainly
can
not
expect
the
fathers
and
mothers
who
have
come
to
the
city
from
farms
or
who
have
emigrated
from
other
lands
to
appreciate
or
rectify
these
dangers
we
can
not
expect
the
young
people
themselves
to
cling
to
conventions
which
are
totally
unsuited
to
modern
city
conditions
nor
yet
to
be
equal
to
the
task
of
forming
new
conventions
through
which
this
more
agglomerate
social
life
may
express
itself
above
all
we
can
not
hope
that
they
will
understand
the
emotional
force
which
seizes
them
and
which
when
it
does
not
find
the
traditional
line
of
domesticity
serves
as
a
cancer
in
the
very
tissues
of
society
and
as
a
disrupter
of
the
securest
social
bonds
no
attempt
is
made
to
treat
the
manifestations
of
this
fundamental
instinct
with
dignity
or
to
give
it
possible
social
utility
the
spontaneous
joy
the
clamor
for
pleasure
the
desire
of
the
young
people
to
appear
finer
and
better
and
altogether
more
lovely
than
they
really
are
the
idealization
not
only
of
each
other
but
of
the
whole
earth
which
they
regard
but
as
a
theater
for
their
noble
exploits
the
unworldly
ambitions
the
romantic
hopes
the
world
in
which
they
live
if
properly
utilized
what
might
they
not
do
to
make
our
sordid
cities
more
beautiful
more
companionable
and
yet
at
the
present
moment
every
city
is
full
of
young
people
who
are
utterly
bewildered
and
uninstructed
in
regard
to
the
basic
experience
which
must
inevitably
come
to
them
and
which
has
varied
remote
and
indirect
expressions
even
those
who
may
not
agree
with
the
authorities
who
claim
that
it
is
this
fundamental
sex
susceptibility
which
suffuses
the
world
with
its
deepest
meaning
and
beauty
and
furnishes
the
momentum
towards
all
art
will
perhaps
permit
me
to
quote
the
classical
expression
of
this
view
as
set
forth
in
that
ancient
and
wonderful
conversation
between
socrates
and
the
wise
woman
diotima
socrates
asks
what
are
they
doing
who
show
all
this
eagerness
and
heat
which
is
called
love
and
what
is
the
object
they
have
in
view
answer
me
diotima
replies
i
will
teach
you
the
object
which
they
have
in
view
is
birth
in
beauty
whether
of
body
or
soul
for
love
socrates
is
not
as
you
imagine
the
love
of
the
beautiful
only
but
the
love
of
birth
in
beauty
because
to
the
mortal
creature
generation
is
a
sort
of
eternity
and
immortality
to
emphasize
the
eternal
aspects
of
love
is
not
of
course
an
easy
undertaking
even
if
we
follow
the
clue
afforded
by
the
heart
of
every
generous
lover
his
experience
at
least
in
certain
moments
tends
to
pull
him
on
and
out
from
the
passion
for
one
to
an
enthusiasm
for
that
highest
beauty
and
excellence
of
which
the
most
perfect
form
is
but
an
inadequate
expression
even
the
most
loutish
youth
vaguely
feels
this
and
at
least
at
rare
intervals
reveals
it
in
his
talk
to
his
girl
his
memory
unexpectedly
brings
hidden
treasures
to
the
surface
of
consciousness
and
he
recalls
the
more
delicate
and
tender
experiences
of
his
childhood
and
earlier
youth
i
remember
the
time
when
my
little
sister
died
that
i
rode
out
to
the
cemetery
feeling
that
everybody
in
chicago
had
moved
away
from
the
town
to
make
room
for
that
kid
funeral
everything
was
so
darned
lonesome
and
yet
it
was
kind
of
peaceful
too
or
i
never
had
a
chance
to
go
into
the
country
when
i
was
a
kid
but
i
remember
one
day
when
i
had
to
deliver
a
package
way
out
on
the
west
side
that
i
saw
a
flock
of
sheep
in
douglas
park
i
had
never
thought
that
a
sheep
could
be
anywhere
but
in
a
picture
and
when
i
saw
those
big
white
spots
on
the
green
grass
beginning
to
move
and
to
turn
into
sheep
i
felt
exactly
as
if
saint
cecilia
had
come
out
of
her
frame
over
the
organ
and
was
walking
in
the
park
such
moments
come
into
the
life
of
the
most
prosaic
youth
living
in
the
most
crowded
quarters
of
the
cities
what
do
we
do
to
encourage
and
to
solidify
those
moments
to
make
them
come
true
in
our
dingy
towns
to
give
them
expression
in
forms
of
art
we
not
only
fail
in
this
undertaking
but
even
debase
existing
forms
of
art
we
are
informed
by
high
authority
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
environment
to
which
youth
so
keenly
responds
as
to
music
and
yet
the
streets
the
vaudeville
shows
the
theaters
are
full
of
the
most
blatant
and
vulgar
songs
the
trivial
and
obscene
words
the
meaningless
and
flippant
airs
run
through
the
heads
of
hundreds
of
young
people
for
hours
at
a
time
while
they
are
engaged
in
monotonous
factory
work
we
totally
ignore
that
ancient
connection
between
music
and
morals
which
was
so
long
insisted
upon
by
philosophers
as
well
as
poets
the
street
music
has
quite
broken
away
from
all
control
both
of
the
educator
and
the
patriot
and
we
have
grown
singularly
careless
in
regard
to
its
influence
upon
young
people
although
we
legislate
against
it
in
saloons
because
of
its
dangerous
influence
there
we
constantly
permit
music
on
the
street
to
incite
that
which
should
be
controlled
to
degrade
that
which
should
be
exalted
to
make
sensuous
that
which
might
be
lifted
into
the
realm
of
the
higher
imagination
our
attitude
towards
music
is
typical
of
our
carelessness
towards
all
those
things
which
make
for
common
joy
and
for
the
restraints
of
higher
civilization
on
the
streets
it
is
as
if
our
cities
had
not
yet
developed
a
sense
of
responsibility
in
regard
to
the
life
of
the
streets
and
continually
forget
that
recreation
is
stronger
than
vice
and
that
recreation
alone
can
stifle
the
lust
for
vice
perhaps
we
need
to
take
a
page
from
the
philosophy
of
the
greeks
to
whom
the
world
of
fact
was
also
the
world
of
the
ideal
and
to
whom
the
realization
of
what
ought
to
be
involved
not
the
destruction
of
what
was
but
merely
its
perfecting
upon
its
own
lines
to
the
greeks
virtue
was
not
a
hard
conformity
to
a
law
felt
as
alien
to
the
natural
character
but
a
free
expression
of
the
inner
life
to
treat
thus
the
fundamental
susceptibility
of
sex
which
now
so
bewilders
the
street
life
and
drives
young
people
themselves
into
all
sorts
of
difficulties
would
mean
to
loosen
it
from
the
things
of
sense
and
to
link
it
to
the
affairs
of
the
imagination
it
would
mean
to
fit
to
this
gross
and
heavy
stuff
the
wings
of
the
mind
to
scatter
from
it
the
clinging
mud
of
banality
and
vulgarity
and
to
speed
it
on
through
our
city
streets
amid
spontaneous
laughter
snatches
of
lyric
song
the
recovered
forms
of
old
dances
and
the
traditional
rondels
of
merry
games
it
would
thus
bring
charm
and
beauty
to
the
prosaic
city
and
connect
it
subtly
with
the
arts
of
the
past
as
well
as
with
the
vigor
and
renewed
life
of
the
future

these
words
written
by
a
poet
to
his
young
son
express
the
longing
which
has
at
times
seized
all
of
us
to
guard
youth
from
the
mass
of
difficulties
which
may
be
traced
to
the
obscure
manifestation
of
that
fundamental
susceptibility
of
which
we
are
all
slow
to
speak
and
concerning
which
we
evade
public
responsibility
although
it
brings
its
scores
of
victims
into
the
police
courts
every
morning
at
the
very
outset
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
senses
of
youth
are
singularly
acute
and
ready
to
respond
to
every
vivid
appeal
we
know
that
nature
herself
has
sharpened
the
senses
for
her
own
purposes
and
is
deliberately
establishing
a
connection
between
them
and
the
newly
awakened
susceptibility
of
sex
for
it
is
only
through
the
outward
senses
that
the
selection
of
an
individual
mate
is
made
and
the
instinct
utilized
for
nature
purposes
it
would
seem
however
that
nature
was
determined
that
the
force
and
constancy
of
the
instinct
must
make
up
for
its
lack
of
precision
and
that
she
was
totally
unconcerned
that
this
instinct
ruthlessly
seized
the
youth
at
the
moment
when
he
was
least
prepared
to
cope
with
it
not
only
because
his
powers
of
and
discrimination
are
unequal
to
the
task
but
because
his
senses
are
helplessly
wide
open
to
the
world
these
early
manifestations
of
the
sex
susceptibility
are
for
the
most
part
vague
and
formless
and
are
absolutely
without
definition
to
the
youth
himself
sometimes
months
and
years
elapse
before
the
individual
mate
is
selected
and
determined
upon
and
during
the
time
when
the
differentiation
is
not
complete
and
it
often
is
not
there
is
of
necessity
a
great
deal
of
groping
and
waste
this
period
of
groping
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
power
for
appreciating
is
far
ahead
of
his
ability
for
expression
the
inner
traffic
fairly
obstructs
the
outer
current
and
it
is
nothing
short
of
cruelty
to
his
senses
as
does
the
modern
city
this
period
is
difficult
everywhere
but
it
seems
at
times
as
if
a
great
city
almost
deliberately
increased
its
perils
the
newly
awakened
senses
are
appealed
to
by
all
that
is
gaudy
and
sensual
by
the
flippant
street
music
the
highly
colored
theater
posters
the
trashy
love
stories
the
feathered
hats
the
cheap
heroics
of
the
revolvers
displayed
in
the
windows
this
fundamental
susceptibility
is
thus
evoked
without
a
corresponding
stir
of
the
higher
imagination
and
the
result
is
as
dangerous
as
possible
we
are
told
upon
good
authority
that
if
the
imagination
is
retarded
while
the
senses
remain
awake
we
have
a
state
of
esthetic
insensibility
in
other
words
the
senses
become
sodden
and
can
not
be
lifted
from
the
ground
it
is
this
state
of
esthetic
insensibility
into
which
we
allow
the
youth
to
fall
which
is
so
distressing
and
so
unjustifiable
sex
impulse
then
becomes
merely
a
dumb
and
powerful
instinct
without
in
the
least
awakening
the
imagination
or
the
heart
nor
does
it
overflow
into
neighboring
fields
of
consciousness
every
city
contains
hundreds
of
degenerates
who
have
been
and
borne
down
by
it
they
fill
the
casual
lodging
houses
and
the
infirmaries
in
many
instances
it
has
pushed
men
of
ability
and
promise
to
the
bottom
of
the
social
scale
warner
in
his
designates
it
as
one
of
the
steady
forces
making
for
failure
and
poverty
and
contends
that
the
inherent
uncleanness
of
their
minds
prevents
many
men
from
rising
above
the
rank
of
day
laborers
and
finally
incapacitates
them
even
for
that
position
he
also
suggests
that
the
modern
man
has
a
stronger
imagination
than
the
man
of
a
few
hundred
years
ago
and
that
sensuality
destroys
him
the
more
rapidly
it
is
difficult
to
state
how
much
evil
and
distress
might
be
averted
if
the
imagination
were
utilized
in
its
higher
capacities
through
the
historic
paths
an
english
moralist
has
lately
asserted
that
much
of
the
evil
of
the
time
may
be
traced
to
outraged
imagination
it
is
the
strongest
quality
of
the
brain
and
it
is
starved
children
from
their
earliest
years
are
hedged
in
with
facts
they
are
not
trained
to
use
their
minds
on
the
unseen
in
failing
to
diffuse
and
utilize
this
fundamental
instinct
of
sex
through
the
imagination
we
not
only
inadvertently
foster
vice
and
enervation
but
we
throw
away
one
of
the
most
precious
implements
for
ministering
to
life
highest
needs
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
ill
adjusted
function
consumes
quite
unnecessarily
vast
stores
of
vital
energy
even
when
we
contemplate
it
in
its
immature
manifestations
which
are
infinitely
more
wholesome
than
the
dumb
swamping
process
every
high
school
boy
and
girl
knows
the
difference
between
the
concentration
and
the
diffusion
of
this
impulse
although
they
would
be
hopelessly
bewildered
by
the
use
of
the
terms
they
will
declare
one
of
their
companions
to
be
in
love
if
his
fancy
is
occupied
by
the
image
of
a
single
person
about
whom
all
the
newly
found
values
gather
and
without
whom
his
solitude
is
an
eternal
melancholy
but
if
the
stimulus
does
not
appear
as
a
definite
image
and
the
values
evoked
are
dispensed
over
the
world
the
young
person
suddenly
seems
to
have
discovered
a
beauty
and
significance
in
many
things
he
responds
to
poetry
he
becomes
a
lover
of
nature
he
is
filled
with
religious
devotion
or
with
philanthropic
zeal
experience
with
young
people
easily
illustrates
the
possibility
and
value
of
diffusion
it
is
neither
a
short
nor
an
easy
undertaking
to
substitute
the
love
of
beauty
for
mere
desire
to
place
the
mind
above
the
senses
but
is
not
this
the
sum
of
the
immemorial
obligation
which
rests
upon
the
adults
of
each
generation
if
they
would
nurture
and
restrain
the
youth
and
has
not
the
whole
history
of
civilization
been
but
one
long
effort
to
substitute
psychic
impulsion
for
the
driving
force
of
blind
appetite
society
has
recognized
the
imitative
play
impulse
of
children
and
provides
them
with
tiny
bricks
with
which
to
build
a
house
and
dolls
upon
which
they
may
lavish
their
tenderness
we
exalt
the
love
of
the
mother
and
the
stability
of
the
home
but
in
regard
to
those
difficult
years
between
childhood
and
maturity
we
beg
the
question
and
unless
we
repress
we
do
nothing
we
are
so
timid
and
inconsistent
that
although
we
declare
the
home
to
be
the
foundation
of
society
we
do
nothing
to
direct
the
force
upon
which
the
continuity
of
the
home
depends
and
yet
to
one
who
has
lived
for
years
in
a
crowded
quarter
where
men
women
and
children
constantly
jostle
each
other
and
press
upon
every
inch
of
space
in
shop
tenement
and
street
nothing
is
more
impressive
than
the
strength
the
continuity
the
varied
and
powerful
manifestations
of
family
affection
it
goes
without
saying
that
every
tenement
house
contains
women
who
for
years
spend
their
hurried
days
in
preparing
food
and
clothing
and
pass
their
sleepless
nights
in
tending
and
nursing
their
exigent
children
with
never
one
thought
for
their
own
comfort
or
pleasure
or
development
save
as
these
may
be
connected
with
the
future
of
their
families
we
all
know
as
a
matter
of
course
that
every
shop
is
crowded
with
workingmen
who
year
after
year
spend
all
of
their
wages
upon
the
nurture
and
education
of
their
children
reserving
for
themselves
but
the
shabbiest
clothing
and
a
crowded
place
at
the
family
table
bad
weather
for
you
to
be
out
in
you
remark
on
a
february
evening
as
you
meet
rheumatic
hobbling
home
through
the
freezing
sleet
without
an
overcoat
yes
it
is
bad
he
assents
but
i
walked
to
work
all
this
last
year
we
sent
the
oldest
boy
back
to
high
school
you
know
and
he
moves
on
with
no
thought
that
he
is
doing
other
than
fulfilling
the
ordinary
lot
of
the
ordinary
man
these
are
the
familiar
and
the
constant
manifestations
of
family
affection
which
are
so
intimate
a
part
of
life
that
we
scarcely
observe
them
in
addition
to
these
we
find
peculiar
manifestations
of
family
devotion
exemplifying
that
touching
affection
which
rises
to
unusual
sacrifice
because
it
is
close
to
pity
and
feebleness
my
cousin
and
his
family
had
to
go
back
to
italy
he
got
to
ellis
island
with
his
wife
and
five
children
but
they
would
let
in
the
boy
so
of
course
they
all
went
back
with
him
my
cousin
was
fearful
disappointed
or
these
are
the
five
children
of
my
brother
he
and
his
wife
my
father
and
mother
were
all
done
for
in
the
bad
time
at
kishinef
up
to
me
all
right
to
take
care
of
the
kids
and
i
no
more
go
back
on
them
than
i
would
on
my
own
or
again
yes
i
have
seven
children
of
my
own
my
husband
died
when
tim
was
born
the
other
three
children
belong
to
my
sister
who
died
the
year
after
my
husband
i
get
on
pretty
well
i
scrub
in
a
factory
every
night
from
six
to
twelve
and
i
go
out
washing
four
days
a
week
so
far
the
children
have
all
gone
through
the
eighth
grade
before
they
quit
school
she
concludes
beaming
with
pride
and
joy
that
wonderful
devotion
to
the
child
seems
at
times
in
the
midst
of
our
stupid
social
and
industrial
arrangements
all
that
keeps
society
human
the
touch
of
nature
which
unites
it
as
it
was
that
same
devotion
which
first
lifted
it
out
of
the
swamp
of
bestiality
the
devotion
to
the
child
is
the
inevitable
conclusion
of
the
two
premises
of
the
practical
syllogism
the
devotion
of
man
to
woman
it
is
of
course
this
tremendous
force
which
makes
possible
the
family
that
bond
which
holds
society
together
and
blends
the
experience
of
generations
into
a
continuous
story
the
family
has
been
called
the
fountain
of
morality
the
source
of
law
the
necessary
prelude
to
the
state
itself
but
while
it
is
continuous
historically
this
dual
bond
must
be
made
anew
a
myriad
times
in
each
generation
and
the
forces
upon
which
its
formation
depend
must
be
powerful
and
unerring
it
would
be
too
great
a
risk
to
leave
it
to
a
force
whose
manifestations
are
intermittent
and
uncertain
the
desired
result
is
too
grave
and
fundamental
one
sunday
evening
an
excited
young
man
came
to
see
me
saying
that
he
must
have
advice
some
one
must
tell
him
at
once
what
to
do
as
his
wife
was
in
the
state
prison
serving
a
sentence
for
a
crime
which
he
himself
had
committed
he
had
seen
her
the
day
before
and
though
she
had
been
there
only
a
month
he
was
convinced
that
she
was
developing
consumption
she
was
only
seventeen
and
could
stand
the
hard
work
and
the
down
women
whom
she
had
for
companions
my
remark
that
a
girl
of
seventeen
was
too
young
to
be
in
the
state
penitentiary
brought
out
the
whole
wretched
story
he
had
been
unsteady
for
many
years
and
the
despair
of
his
thoroughly
respectable
family
who
had
sent
him
west
the
year
before
in
arkansas
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
married
her
his
mother
was
far
from
pleased
but
had
finally
sent
him
money
to
bring
his
bride
to
chicago
in
the
hope
that
he
might
settle
there
they
stopped
at
a
small
town
for
the
na√Øve
reason
that
he
wanted
to
have
an
aching
tooth
pulled
but
the
tooth
gave
him
an
excellent
opportunity
to
have
a
drink
and
before
he
reached
the
office
of
the
country
practitioner
he
was
intoxicated
as
they
passed
through
the
vestibule
he
stole
an
overcoat
hanging
there
although
the
little
wife
piteously
begged
him
to
let
it
alone
out
of
sheer
bravado
he
carried
it
across
his
arm
as
they
walked
down
the
street
and
was
of
course
immediately
arrested
with
the
goods
upon
him
in
sheer
terror
of
being
separated
from
her
husband
the
wife
insisted
that
she
had
been
an
accomplice
and
together
they
were
put
into
the
county
jail
awaiting
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
on
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
they
were
permitted
to
talk
to
each
other
through
the
grating
which
separated
the
men
visiting
quarters
from
the
women
the
young
wife
told
her
husband
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
swear
that
she
had
stolen
the
overcoat
what
could
she
do
if
he
were
sent
to
prison
and
she
were
left
free
she
was
afraid
to
go
to
his
people
and
could
not
possibly
go
back
to
hers
in
spite
of
his
protest
that
very
night
she
sent
for
the
attorney
and
made
a
full
confession
giving
her
age
as
eighteen
in
the
hope
of
making
her
testimony
more
valuable
from
that
time
on
they
stuck
to
the
lie
through
the
indictment
the
trial
and
her
conviction
apparently
it
had
seemed
to
him
only
a
plot
until
he
had
visited
the
penitentiary
the
day
before
and
had
really
seen
her
piteous
plight
remorse
had
seized
him
at
last
and
he
was
ready
to
make
every
restitution
she
however
had
no
notion
of
giving
up
on
the
contrary
as
she
realized
more
clearly
what
prison
life
meant
she
was
daily
more
determined
to
spare
him
the
experience
her
letters
written
in
the
unformed
hand
of
a
child
for
her
husband
had
himself
taught
her
to
read
and
write
were
filled
with
a
riot
of
the
martyr
joy
as
he
feels
the
iron
enter
the
flesh
thus
had
an
illiterate
neglected
girl
through
sheer
devotion
to
a
worthless
sort
of
young
fellow
inclined
to
drink
entered
into
that
noble
company
of
martyrs
when
girls
go
wrong
what
happens
how
has
this
tremendous
force
valuable
and
necessary
for
the
foundation
of
the
family
become
misdirected
when
its
manifestations
follow
the
legitimate
channels
of
wedded
life
we
call
them
praiseworthy
but
there
are
other
manifestations
quite
outside
the
legal
and
moral
channels
which
yet
compel
our
admiration
a
young
woman
of
my
acquaintance
was
married
to
a
professional
criminal
named
joe
three
months
after
the
wedding
he
was
arrested
and
sent
up
for
two
years
molly
had
always
been
accustomed
to
many
lovers
but
she
remained
faithful
to
her
absent
husband
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
obtained
a
divorce
which
the
state
law
makes
easy
for
the
wife
of
a
convict
and
married
a
man
who
was
rich
and
respectable
in
fact
he
owned
the
small
manufacturing
establishment
in
which
her
mother
did
the
scrubbing
he
moved
his
bride
to
another
part
of
town
six
miles
away
provided
her
with
a
flat
furniture
upholstered
in
cut
velvet
and
many
other
luxuries
of
which
molly
heretofore
had
only
dreamed
one
day
as
she
was
wheeling
a
handsome
baby
carriage
up
and
down
the
prosperous
street
her
brother
who
was
joe
pal
came
to
tell
her
that
joe
was
out
had
come
to
the
old
tenement
and
was
mighty
sore
because
she
had
gone
back
on
him
without
a
moment
hesitation
molly
turned
the
baby
carriage
in
the
direction
of
her
old
home
and
never
stopped
wheeling
it
until
she
had
compassed
the
entire
six
miles
she
and
joe
rented
the
old
room
and
went
to
housekeeping
the
rich
and
respectable
husband
made
every
effort
to
persuade
her
to
come
back
and
then
another
series
of
efforts
to
recover
his
child
before
he
set
her
free
through
a
court
proceeding
joe
however
steadfastly
refused
to
marry
her
still
sore
because
she
had
not
stood
by
as
he
worked
only
intermittently
and
was
too
closely
supervised
by
the
police
to
do
much
at
his
old
occupation
molly
was
obliged
to
support
the
humble
m√©nage
by
scrubbing
in
a
neighboring
lodging
house
and
by
washing
the
odd
shirts
of
the
lodgers
for
five
years
during
which
time
two
children
were
born
when
she
was
constantly
subjected
to
the
taunts
of
her
neighbors
and
when
all
the
charitable
agencies
refused
to
give
help
to
such
an
irregular
household
molly
happily
went
on
her
course
with
no
shade
of
regret
or
sorrow
i
all
right
as
long
as
joe
keeps
out
of
the
jug
was
her
slogan
of
happiness
low
in
tone
perhaps
but
genuine
and
game
her
surroundings
were
as
sordid
as
possible
consisting
of
a
constantly
changing
series
of
cheap
furnished
rooms
in
which
the
battered
baby
carriage
was
the
sole
witness
of
better
days
but
molly
heart
was
full
of
courage
and
happiness
and
she
was
never
desolate
until
her
criminal
lover
was
sent
up
again
this
time
on
a
really
serious
charge
these
irregular
manifestations
form
a
link
between
that
world
in
which
each
one
struggles
to
live
respectable
and
that
nether
world
in
which
are
also
found
cases
of
devotion
and
of
enduring
affection
arising
out
of
the
midst
of
the
folly
and
the
shame
the
girl
there
who
through
all
tribulation
supports
her
recreant
lover
or
the
girl
who
overcomes
her
drink
and
opium
habits
who
renounces
luxuries
and
goes
back
to
uninteresting
daily
toil
for
the
sake
of
the
good
opinion
of
a
man
who
wishes
her
to
appear
decent
although
he
never
means
to
marry
her
these
are
also
impressive
one
of
our
earliest
experiences
at
had
to
do
with
a
lover
of
this
type
and
the
charming
young
girl
who
had
become
fatally
attached
to
him
i
can
see
her
now
running
for
protection
up
the
broad
steps
of
the
columned
piazza
then
surrounding
her
slender
figure
was
trembling
with
fright
her
face
swollen
and
bloodstained
from
the
blows
he
had
dealt
her
he
is
apt
to
abuse
me
when
he
is
drunk
was
the
only
explanation
and
that
given
by
way
of
apology
which
could
be
extracted
from
her
when
we
discovered
that
there
had
been
no
marriage
ceremony
that
there
were
no
living
children
that
she
had
twice
narrowly
escaped
losing
her
life
it
seemed
a
simple
matter
to
insist
that
the
relation
should
be
broken
off
she
apathetically
remained
at
for
a
few
weeks
but
when
her
strength
had
somewhat
returned
when
her
lover
began
to
recover
from
his
prolonged
debauch
of
whiskey
and
opium
she
insisted
upon
going
home
every
day
to
prepare
his
meals
and
to
see
that
the
little
tenement
was
clean
and
comfortable
because
pierre
is
always
so
sick
and
weak
after
one
of
those
long
ones
this
of
course
meant
that
she
was
drifting
back
to
him
and
when
she
was
at
last
restrained
by
that
moral
compulsion
by
that
overwhelming
of
another
will
which
is
always
so
ruthlessly
exerted
by
those
who
are
conscious
that
virtue
is
struggling
with
vice
her
mind
gave
way
and
she
became
utterly
distraught
a
poor
little
ophelia
i
met
her
one
night
wandering
in
the
hall
half
dressed
in
the
tawdry
pink
gown
that
pierre
liked
best
of
all
and
groping
on
the
blank
wall
to
find
the
door
which
might
permit
her
to
escape
to
her
lover
in
a
few
days
it
was
obvious
that
hospital
restraint
was
necessary
but
when
she
finally
recovered
we
were
obliged
to
admit
that
there
is
no
civic
authority
which
can
control
the
acts
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
from
the
hospital
she
followed
her
heart
directly
back
to
pierre
who
had
in
the
meantime
moved
out
of
the
neighborhood
we
knew
later
that
he
had
degraded
the
poor
child
still
further
by
obliging
her
to
earn
money
for
his
drugs
by
that
last
method
resorted
to
by
a
degenerate
man
to
whom
a
devotion
still
clings
it
is
inevitable
that
a
force
which
is
enduring
enough
to
withstand
the
discouragements
the
suffering
and
privation
of
daily
living
strenuous
enough
to
overcome
and
rectify
the
impulses
which
make
for
greed
and
should
be
able
even
under
untoward
conditions
to
lift
up
and
transfigure
those
who
are
really
within
its
grasp
and
set
them
in
marked
contrast
to
those
who
are
merely
playing
a
game
with
it
or
using
it
for
gain
but
what
has
happened
to
these
wretched
girls
why
has
this
beneficent
current
cast
them
upon
the
shores
of
death
and
destruction
when
it
should
have
carried
them
into
the
safe
port
of
domesticity
through
whose
fault
has
this
basic
emotion
served
merely
to
trick
and
deride
them
older
nations
have
taken
a
well
defined
line
of
action
in
regard
to
it
among
the
neighbors
are
many
of
the
latin
races
who
employ
a
careful
chaperonage
over
their
marriageable
daughters
and
provide
husbands
for
them
at
an
early
age
my
father
will
get
a
husband
for
me
this
winter
announces
angelina
whose
father
has
brought
her
to
a
party
at
and
she
adds
with
a
toss
of
her
head
i
saw
two
already
but
my
father
says
they
have
saved
enough
money
to
marry
me
she
feels
quite
as
content
in
her
father
wisdom
and
ability
to
provide
her
with
a
husband
as
she
does
in
his
capacity
to
escort
her
home
safely
from
the
party
he
does
not
permit
her
to
cross
the
threshold
after
nightfall
unaccompanied
by
himself
and
unless
the
dowry
and
the
husband
are
provided
before
she
is
eighteen
he
will
consider
himself
derelict
in
his
duty
towards
her
francesca
even
come
to
the
sodality
meeting
this
winter
she
lives
only
across
from
the
church
but
her
mother
wo
let
her
come
because
her
father
is
out
west
working
on
a
railroad
is
a
comment
one
often
hears
the
system
works
well
only
when
it
is
carried
logically
through
to
the
end
of
an
early
marriage
with
a
husband
even
with
the
latin
races
when
the
system
is
tried
in
america
it
often
breaks
down
and
when
the
anywhere
imitate
this
r√©gime
it
is
usually
utterly
futile
they
follow
the
first
part
of
the
program
as
far
as
repression
is
concerned
but
they
find
it
impossible
to
follow
the
second
because
all
sorts
of
inherited
notions
deter
them
the
repressed
girl
if
she
is
not
one
of
the
languishing
type
takes
matters
into
her
own
hands
and
finds
her
pleasures
in
illicit
ways
without
her
parents
knowledge
i
had
no
idea
my
daughter
was
going
to
public
dances
she
always
told
me
she
was
spending
the
night
with
her
cousin
on
the
south
side
i
had
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
many
a
mother
explains
an
officer
who
has
had
a
long
experience
in
the
juvenile
court
of
chicago
and
has
listened
to
hundreds
of
cases
involving
wayward
girls
gives
it
as
his
deliberate
impression
that
a
large
majority
of
cases
are
from
families
where
the
discipline
had
been
rigid
where
they
had
taken
but
half
of
the
convention
of
the
old
world
and
left
the
other
half
unless
we
mean
to
go
back
to
these
old
world
customs
which
are
already
hopelessly
broken
there
would
seem
to
be
but
one
path
open
to
us
in
america
that
path
implies
freedom
for
the
young
people
made
safe
only
through
their
own
this
in
turn
must
be
based
upon
knowledge
and
habits
of
clean
companionship
in
point
of
fact
no
course
between
the
two
is
safe
in
a
modern
city
and
in
the
most
crowded
quarters
the
young
people
themselves
are
working
out
a
protective
code
which
reminds
one
of
the
instinctive
protection
that
the
child
in
the
country
learns
in
regard
to
poisonous
plants
and
marshy
places
or
of
the
cautions
and
abilities
that
the
mountain
child
develops
in
regard
to
ice
and
precipices
this
statement
of
course
does
not
hold
good
concerning
a
large
number
of
children
in
every
crowded
city
quarter
who
may
be
classed
as
degenerates
the
children
of
careless
or
dissolute
mothers
who
fall
into
all
sorts
of
degenerate
habits
and
associations
before
childhood
is
passed
who
can
not
be
said
to
have
gone
wrong
at
any
one
moment
because
they
have
never
been
in
the
right
path
even
of
innocent
childhood
but
the
statement
is
sound
concerning
thousands
of
girls
who
go
to
and
from
work
every
day
with
crowds
of
young
men
who
meet
them
again
and
again
in
the
occasional
evening
pleasures
of
the
more
decent
dance
halls
or
on
a
sunday
afternoon
in
the
parks
the
mothers
who
are
of
most
use
to
these
normal
city
working
girls
are
the
mothers
who
develop
a
sense
of
companionship
with
the
changing
experiences
of
their
daughters
who
are
willing
to
modify
social
conventions
into
rules
of
conduct
which
are
of
actual
service
to
their
children
in
their
daily
lives
of
factory
work
and
of
city
amusements
those
mothers
through
their
sympathy
and
adaptability
substitute
keen
present
interests
and
activity
for
solemn
warnings
and
restraint
for
repression
their
vigorous
family
life
allies
itself
by
a
dozen
bonds
to
the
educational
the
industrial
and
the
recreational
organizations
of
the
modern
city
and
makes
for
intelligent
understanding
industrial
efficiency
and
sane
social
pleasures
by
all
means
let
us
preserve
the
safety
of
the
home
but
let
us
also
make
safe
the
street
in
which
the
majority
of
our
young
people
find
their
recreation
and
form
their
permanent
relationships
let
us
not
forget
that
the
great
processes
of
social
life
develop
themselves
through
influences
of
which
each
participant
is
unconscious
as
he
struggles
alone
and
unaided
in
the
strength
of
a
current
which
seizes
him
and
bears
him
along
with
myriads
of
others
a
current
which
may
so
easily
wreck
the
very
foundations
of
domesticity
chapter
iii
the
quest
for
adventure
a
certain
number
of
the
outrages
upon
the
spirit
of
youth
may
be
traced
to
degenerate
or
careless
parents
who
totally
neglect
their
responsibilities
a
certain
other
large
number
of
wrongs
are
due
to
sordid
men
and
women
who
deliberately
use
the
legitimate
of
young
people
as
lures
into
vice
there
remains
however
a
third
very
large
class
of
offenses
for
which
the
community
as
a
whole
must
be
held
responsible
if
it
would
escape
the
condemnation
woe
unto
him
by
whom
offenses
come
this
class
of
offenses
is
traceable
to
a
dense
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
average
citizen
as
to
the
requirements
of
youth
and
to
a
persistent
blindness
on
the
part
of
educators
as
to
youth
most
obvious
needs
the
young
people
are
overborne
by
their
own
undirected
and
misguided
energies
a
mere
temperamental
outbreak
in
a
brief
period
of
obstreperousness
exposes
a
promising
boy
to
arrest
and
imprisonment
an
accidental
combination
of
circumstances
too
complicated
and
overwhelming
to
be
coped
with
by
an
immature
mind
condemns
a
growing
lad
to
a
criminal
career
these
impulsive
misdeeds
may
be
thought
of
as
dividing
into
two
great
trends
somewhat
obscurely
analogous
to
the
two
historic
divisions
of
man
motive
power
for
we
are
told
that
all
the
activities
of
primitive
man
and
even
those
of
his
more
civilized
successors
may
be
broadly
traced
to
the
impulsion
of
two
elemental
appetites
the
first
drove
him
to
the
search
for
food
the
hunt
developing
into
war
with
neighboring
tribes
and
finally
broadening
into
barter
and
modern
commerce
the
second
urged
him
to
secure
and
protect
a
mate
developing
into
domestic
life
widening
into
the
building
of
homes
and
cities
into
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
a
care
for
beauty
in
the
life
of
each
boy
there
comes
a
time
when
these
primitive
instincts
urge
him
to
action
when
he
is
himself
frightened
by
their
undefined
power
he
is
faced
by
the
necessity
of
taming
them
of
reducing
them
to
manageable
impulses
just
at
the
moment
when
a
will
is
the
wind
will
or
in
the
words
of
a
veteran
educator
at
the
time
when
it
is
almost
impossible
for
an
adult
to
realize
the
boy
irresponsibility
and
even
moral
neurasthenia
that
the
boy
often
fails
may
be
traced
in
those
pitiful
figures
which
show
that
between
two
and
three
times
as
much
incorrigibility
occurs
between
the
ages
of
thirteen
and
sixteen
as
at
any
other
period
of
life
the
second
division
of
motive
power
has
been
treated
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
present
chapter
is
an
effort
to
point
out
the
necessity
for
an
understanding
of
the
first
trend
of
motives
if
we
would
minimize
the
temptations
of
the
struggle
and
free
the
boy
from
the
constant
sense
of
the
stupidity
and
savagery
of
life
to
set
his
feet
in
the
worn
path
of
civilization
is
not
an
easy
task
but
it
may
give
us
a
clue
for
the
undertaking
to
trace
his
misdeeds
to
the
unrecognized
and
primitive
spirit
of
adventure
corresponding
to
the
old
activity
of
the
hunt
of
warfare
and
of
discovery
to
do
this
intelligently
we
shall
have
to
remember
that
many
boys
in
the
years
immediately
following
school
find
no
restraint
either
in
tradition
or
character
they
drop
learning
as
a
childish
thing
and
look
upon
school
as
a
tiresome
task
that
is
finished
they
demand
pleasure
as
the
right
of
one
who
earns
his
own
living
they
have
developed
no
capacity
for
recreation
demanding
mental
effort
or
even
muscular
skill
and
are
obliged
to
seek
only
that
depending
upon
sight
sound
and
taste
many
of
them
begin
to
pay
board
to
their
mothers
and
make
the
best
bargain
they
can
that
more
money
may
be
left
to
spend
in
the
evening
they
even
bait
the
excitement
of
losing
a
job
and
often
provoke
a
foreman
if
only
to
see
how
much
he
will
stand
they
are
constitutionally
unable
to
enjoy
anything
continuously
and
follow
their
vagrant
wills
unhindered
unfortunately
the
city
lends
itself
to
this
distraction
at
the
best
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
to
select
and
what
to
eliminate
as
objects
of
attention
among
its
thronged
streets
its
glittering
shops
its
gaudy
advertisements
of
shows
and
amusements
it
is
perhaps
to
the
credit
of
many
city
boys
that
the
very
first
puerile
spirit
of
adventure
looking
abroad
in
the
world
for
material
upon
which
to
exercise
itself
seems
to
center
about
the
railroad
the
impulse
is
not
unlike
that
which
excites
the
lad
to
dream
of
the
beauty
and
mystery
of
the
ships
and
the
magic
of
the
sea
i
cite
here
a
dozen
charges
upon
which
boys
were
brought
into
the
juvenile
court
of
chicago
all
of
which
might
be
designated
as
deeds
of
adventure
a
surprising
number
as
the
reader
will
observe
are
connected
with
railroads
they
are
taken
from
the
court
records
and
repeat
the
actual
words
used
by
police
officers
irate
neighbors
or
discouraged
parents
when
the
boys
were
brought
before
the
judge
building
fires
along
the
railroad
tracks
flagging
trains
throwing
stones
at
moving
train
windows
shooting
at
the
actors
in
the
olympic
theatre
with
sling
shots
breaking
signal
lights
on
the
railroad
stealing
linseed
oil
barrels
from
the
railroad
to
make
a
fire
taking
waste
from
an
axle
box
and
burning
it
upon
the
railroad
tracks
turning
a
switch
and
running
a
street
car
off
the
track
staying
away
from
home
to
sleep
in
barns
setting
fire
to
a
barn
in
order
to
see
the
fire
engines
come
up
the
street
knocking
down
signs
cutting
western
union
cable
another
dozen
charges
also
taken
from
actual
court
records
might
be
added
as
illustrating
the
spirit
of
adventure
for
although
stealing
is
involved
in
all
of
them
the
deeds
were
doubtless
inspired
much
more
by
the
adventurous
impulse
than
by
a
desire
for
the
loot
itself
stealing
thirteen
pigeons
from
a
barn
stealing
a
bathing
suit
stealing
a
tent
stealing
ten
dollars
from
mother
with
which
to
buy
a
revolver
stealing
a
horse
blanket
to
use
at
night
when
it
was
cold
sleeping
on
the
wharf
breaking
a
seal
on
a
freight
car
to
steal
grain
for
chickens
stealing
apples
from
a
freight
car
stealing
a
candy
peddler
wagon
to
be
full
up
just
for
once
stealing
a
hand
car
stealing
a
bicycle
to
take
a
ride
stealing
a
horse
and
buggy
and
driving
miles
into
the
country
stealing
a
stray
horse
on
the
prairie
and
trying
to
sell
it
for
twenty
dollars
of
another
dozen
it
might
be
claimed
that
they
were
also
due
to
this
same
adventurous
spirit
although
the
first
six
were
classed
as
disorderly
conduct
calling
a
neighbor
a
scab
breaking
down
a
fence
flipping
cars
picking
up
coal
from
railroad
tracks
carrying
a
concealed
dagger
and
stabbing
a
playmate
with
it
throwing
stones
at
a
railroad
employee
the
next
three
were
called
vagrancy
loafing
on
the
docks
sleeping
out
nights
getting
wandering
spells
one
designated
petty
larceny
was
cutting
telephone
wires
under
the
sidewalk
and
selling
them
another
called
burglary
was
taking
locks
off
from
basement
doors
and
the
last
one
bore
the
dignified
title
of
resisting
an
officer
because
the
boy
who
was
riding
on
the
fender
of
a
street
car
refused
to
move
when
an
officer
ordered
him
off
of
course
one
easily
recalls
other
cases
in
which
the
manifestations
were
negative
i
remember
an
exasperated
and
frightened
mother
who
took
a
boy
of
fourteen
into
court
upon
the
charge
of
incorrigibility
she
accused
him
of
shooting
craps
smoking
cigarettes
keeping
bad
company
being
idle
the
mother
regrets
it
now
however
for
she
thinks
that
taking
a
boy
into
court
only
gives
him
a
bad
name
and
that
the
police
are
down
on
a
boy
who
has
once
been
in
court
and
that
that
makes
it
harder
for
him
she
hardly
recognizes
her
once
troublesome
charge
in
the
steady
young
man
of
nineteen
who
brings
home
all
his
wages
and
is
the
pride
and
stay
of
her
old
age
i
recall
another
boy
who
worked
his
way
to
new
york
and
back
again
to
chicago
before
he
was
quite
fourteen
years
old
skilfully
escaping
the
truant
officers
as
well
as
the
police
and
special
railroad
detectives
he
told
his
story
with
great
pride
but
always
modestly
admitted
that
he
could
never
have
done
it
if
his
father
had
not
been
a
locomotive
engineer
so
that
he
had
played
around
railroad
tracks
and
was
onto
them
ever
since
he
was
a
small
kid
there
are
many
of
these
adventurous
boys
who
exhibit
a
curious
incapacity
for
any
effort
which
requires
sustained
energy
they
show
an
absolute
lack
of
interest
in
the
accomplishment
of
what
they
undertake
so
marked
that
if
challenged
in
the
midst
of
their
activity
they
will
be
quite
unable
to
tell
you
the
end
they
have
in
view
then
there
are
those
tramp
boys
who
are
the
despair
of
every
one
who
tries
to
deal
with
them
i
remember
the
case
of
a
boy
who
traveled
almost
around
the
world
in
the
years
lying
between
the
ages
of
eleven
and
fifteen
he
had
lived
for
six
months
in
honolulu
where
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
settle
when
the
irresistible
wanderlust
again
seized
him
he
was
scrupulously
neat
in
his
habits
and
something
of
a
dandy
in
appearance
he
boasted
that
he
had
never
stolen
although
he
had
been
arrested
several
times
on
the
charge
of
vagrancy
a
fate
which
befell
him
in
chicago
and
landed
him
in
the
detention
home
connected
with
the
juvenile
court
the
judge
gained
a
personal
hold
upon
him
and
the
lad
tried
with
all
the
powers
of
his
untrained
moral
nature
to
make
good
and
please
the
judge
monotonous
factory
work
was
not
to
be
thought
of
in
connection
with
him
but
his
good
friend
the
judge
found
a
place
for
him
as
a
in
a
men
club
where
it
was
hoped
that
the
uniform
and
the
variety
of
experience
might
enable
him
to
take
the
first
steps
toward
regular
pay
and
a
settled
life
through
another
however
he
heard
of
the
find
of
a
diamond
carelessly
left
in
one
of
the
wash
rooms
of
the
club
the
chance
to
throw
out
mysterious
hints
of
its
whereabouts
to
bargain
for
its
restoration
to
tell
of
great
diamond
deals
he
had
heard
of
in
his
travels
inevitably
laid
him
open
to
suspicion
which
resulted
in
his
dismissal
although
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
beyond
gloating
over
its
adventurous
aspects
in
spite
of
skilful
efforts
made
to
detain
him
he
once
more
started
on
his
travels
throwing
out
such
diverse
hints
as
that
of
a
trip
into
old
mexico
or
following
up
roosevelt
into
africa
there
is
an
entire
series
of
difficulties
directly
traceable
to
the
foolish
and
adventurous
persistence
of
carrying
loaded
firearms
the
morning
paper
of
the
day
in
which
i
am
writing
records
the
following
a
party
of
boys
led
by
daniel
thirteen
years
old
had
gathered
in
front
of
the
house
and
was
throwing
stones
at
nieczgodzki
in
revenge
for
a
whipping
that
he
received
at
his
hands
about
a
month
ago
the
polish
boy
ordered
them
away
and
threatened
to
go
into
the
house
and
get
a
revolver
if
they
did
not
stop
pfister
one
of
the
boys
in
party
called
him
a
coward
and
when
he
pulled
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
dared
him
to
put
it
away
and
meet
him
in
a
fist
fight
in
the
street
instead
of
accepting
the
challenge
nieczgodzki
aimed
his
revolver
at
pfister
and
fired
the
bullet
crashed
through
the
top
of
his
head
and
entered
the
brain
he
was
rushed
to
the
alexian
brothers
hospital
but
died
a
short
time
after
being
received
there
nieczgodzki
was
arrested
and
held
without
bail
this
tale
could
be
duplicated
almost
every
morning
what
might
be
merely
a
boyish
scrap
is
turned
into
a
tragedy
because
some
boy
has
a
revolver
many
citizens
in
chicago
have
been
made
heartsick
during
the
past
month
by
the
knowledge
that
a
boy
of
nineteen
was
lodged
in
the
county
jail
awaiting
the
death
penalty
he
had
shot
and
killed
a
policeman
during
the
scrimmage
of
an
arrest
although
the
offense
for
which
he
was
being
taken
in
was
a
trifling
one
his
parents
came
to
chicago
twenty
years
ago
from
a
little
farm
in
ohio
the
best
type
of
americans
whom
we
boast
to
be
the
backbone
of
our
cities
the
mother
who
has
aged
and
sickened
since
the
trial
can
only
say
that
davie
was
never
a
bad
boy
until
about
five
years
ago
when
he
began
to
go
with
this
gang
who
are
always
looking
out
for
fun
then
there
are
those
piteous
cases
due
to
a
perfervid
imagination
which
fails
to
find
material
suited
to
its
demands
i
can
recall
misadventures
of
children
living
within
a
few
blocks
of
which
may
well
fill
with
chagrin
those
of
us
who
are
trying
to
administer
to
their
deeper
needs
i
remember
a
greek
boy
of
fifteen
who
was
arrested
for
attempting
to
hang
a
young
turk
stirred
by
some
vague
notion
of
carrying
on
a
traditional
warfare
and
of
adding
another
page
to
the
heroic
annals
of
greek
history
when
sifted
the
incident
amounted
to
little
more
than
a
graphic
threat
and
the
lad
was
dismissed
by
the
court
covered
with
confusion
and
remorse
that
he
had
brought
disgrace
upon
the
name
of
greece
when
he
had
hoped
to
add
to
its
glory
i
remember
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
the
bohemian
boy
of
thirteen
who
committed
suicide
because
he
could
not
make
good
in
school
and
wished
to
show
that
he
too
had
the
stuff
in
him
as
stated
in
the
piteous
little
letter
left
behind
this
same
love
of
excitement
the
desire
to
jump
out
of
the
humdrum
experience
of
life
also
induces
boys
to
experiment
with
drinks
and
drugs
to
a
surprising
extent
for
several
years
the
residents
of
struggled
with
the
difficulty
of
prohibiting
the
sale
of
cocaine
to
minors
under
a
totally
inadequate
code
of
legislation
which
has
at
last
happily
been
changed
to
one
more
effective
and
enforcible
the
long
effort
brought
us
into
contact
with
dozens
of
boys
who
had
become
victims
of
the
cocaine
habit
the
first
group
of
these
boys
was
discovered
in
the
house
of
army
george
this
man
sold
cocaine
on
the
streets
and
also
in
the
levee
district
by
a
system
of
signals
so
that
the
word
cocaine
need
never
be
mentioned
and
the
style
and
size
of
the
package
was
changed
so
often
that
even
a
vigilant
police
found
it
hard
to
locate
it
what
could
be
more
exciting
to
a
lad
than
a
traffic
in
a
contraband
article
carried
on
in
this
mysterious
fashion
i
recall
our
experience
with
a
gang
of
boys
living
on
a
neighboring
street
there
were
eight
of
them
altogether
the
eldest
seventeen
years
of
age
the
youngest
thirteen
and
they
practically
lived
the
life
of
vagrants
what
answered
to
their
club
house
was
a
corner
lot
on
harrison
and
desplaines
streets
strewn
with
old
boilers
in
which
they
slept
by
night
and
many
times
by
day
the
gang
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
during
the
summer
of
by
a
distracted
mother
who
suspected
that
they
were
all
addicted
to
some
drug
she
was
terribly
frightened
over
the
state
of
her
youngest
boy
of
thirteen
who
was
hideously
emaciated
and
his
mind
reduced
almost
to
vacancy
i
remember
the
poor
woman
as
she
sat
in
the
reception
room
at
holding
the
unconscious
boy
in
her
arms
rocking
herself
back
and
forth
in
her
fright
and
despair
saying
i
have
seen
them
go
with
the
drink
and
eat
the
hideous
opium
but
i
never
knew
anything
like
this
an
investigation
showed
that
cocaine
had
first
been
offered
to
these
boys
on
the
street
by
a
colored
man
an
agent
of
a
drug
store
who
had
given
them
samples
and
urged
them
to
try
it
in
three
or
four
months
they
had
become
hopelessly
addicted
to
its
use
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
when
they
were
brought
to
they
were
all
in
a
critical
condition
at
that
time
not
one
of
them
was
either
going
to
school
or
working
they
stole
from
their
parents
swiped
junk
pawned
their
clothes
and
shoes
did
any
desperate
thing
to
get
the
dope
as
they
called
it
of
course
they
continually
required
more
and
had
spent
as
much
as
eight
dollars
a
night
for
cocaine
which
they
used
to
share
and
share
alike
it
sounds
like
a
large
amount
but
it
really
meant
only
four
doses
each
during
the
night
as
at
that
time
they
were
taking
cents
worth
at
once
if
they
could
possibly
secure
it
the
boys
would
tell
nothing
for
three
or
four
days
after
they
were
discovered
in
spite
of
the
united
efforts
of
their
families
the
police
and
the
residents
of
but
finally
the
superior
boy
of
the
gang
the
manliest
and
the
least
debauched
told
his
tale
and
the
others
followed
in
quick
succession
they
were
willing
to
go
somewhere
to
be
helped
and
were
even
eager
if
they
could
go
together
and
finally
seven
of
them
were
sent
to
the
presbyterian
hospital
for
four
weeks
treatment
and
afterwards
all
went
to
the
country
together
for
six
weeks
more
the
emaciated
child
gained
twenty
pounds
during
his
sojourn
in
the
hospital
the
head
of
which
testified
that
at
least
three
of
the
boys
could
have
stood
but
little
more
of
the
irregular
living
and
doping
at
the
present
moment
they
are
all
save
one
doing
well
although
they
were
rescued
so
late
that
they
seemed
to
have
but
little
chance
one
is
still
struggling
with
the
appetite
on
an
iowa
farm
and
dares
not
trust
himself
in
the
city
because
he
knows
too
well
how
cocaine
may
be
procured
in
spite
of
better
legislation
it
is
doubtful
whether
these
boys
could
ever
have
been
pulled
through
unless
they
had
been
allowed
to
keep
together
through
the
hospital
and
convalescing
period
unless
we
had
been
able
to
utilize
the
gang
spirit
and
to
turn
its
collective
force
towards
overcoming
the
desire
for
the
drug
the
desire
to
dream
and
see
visions
also
plays
an
important
part
with
the
boys
who
habitually
use
cocaine
i
recall
a
small
hut
used
by
boys
for
this
purpose
they
washed
dishes
in
a
neighboring
restaurant
and
as
soon
as
they
had
earned
a
few
cents
they
invested
in
cocaine
which
they
kept
pinned
underneath
their
suspenders
when
they
had
accumulated
enough
for
a
real
debauch
they
went
to
this
hut
and
for
several
days
were
dead
to
the
outside
world
one
boy
told
me
that
in
his
dreams
he
saw
large
rooms
paved
with
gold
and
silver
money
the
walls
papered
with
greenbacks
and
that
he
took
away
in
buckets
all
that
he
could
carry
this
desire
for
adventure
also
seizes
girls
a
group
of
girls
ranging
in
age
from
twelve
to
seventeen
was
discovered
in
chicago
last
june
two
of
whom
were
being
trained
by
older
women
to
open
tills
in
small
shops
to
pick
pockets
to
remove
handkerchiefs
furs
and
purses
and
to
lift
merchandise
from
the
counters
of
department
stores
all
the
articles
stolen
were
at
once
taken
to
their
teachers
and
the
girls
themselves
received
no
remuneration
except
occasional
sprees
to
the
theaters
or
other
places
of
amusement
the
girls
gave
no
coherent
reason
for
their
actions
beyond
the
statement
that
they
liked
the
excitement
and
the
fun
of
it
doubtless
to
the
thrill
of
danger
was
added
the
pleasure
and
interest
of
being
daily
in
the
shops
and
the
glitter
of
down
town
the
boys
are
more
indifferent
to
this
downtown
life
and
are
apt
to
carry
on
their
adventures
on
the
docks
the
railroad
tracks
or
best
of
all
upon
the
unoccupied
prairie
this
inveterate
demand
of
youth
that
life
shall
afford
a
large
element
of
excitement
is
in
a
measure
well
founded
we
know
of
course
that
it
is
necessary
to
accept
excitement
as
an
inevitable
part
of
recreation
that
the
first
step
in
recreation
is
that
excitement
which
stirs
the
worn
or
sleeping
centers
of
a
man
body
and
mind
it
is
only
when
it
is
followed
by
nothing
else
that
it
defeats
its
own
end
that
it
uses
up
strength
and
does
not
create
it
in
the
actual
experience
of
these
boys
the
excitement
has
demoralized
them
and
led
them
into
when
however
they
seek
legitimate
pleasure
and
say
with
great
pride
that
they
are
ready
to
pay
for
it
what
they
find
is
legal
but
scarcely
more
wholesome
it
is
still
merely
excitement
looping
the
loop
amid
shrieks
of
simulated
terror
or
dancing
in
disorderly
saloon
halls
are
perhaps
the
natural
reactions
to
a
day
spent
in
noisy
factories
and
in
trolley
cars
whirling
through
the
distracting
streets
but
the
city
which
permits
them
to
be
the
acme
of
pleasure
and
recreation
to
its
young
people
commits
a
grievous
mistake
may
we
not
assume
that
this
love
for
excitement
this
desire
for
adventure
is
basic
and
will
be
evinced
by
each
generation
of
city
boys
as
a
challenge
to
their
elders
and
yet
those
of
us
who
live
in
chicago
are
obliged
to
confess
that
last
year
there
were
arrested
and
brought
into
court
fifteen
thousand
young
people
under
the
age
of
twenty
who
had
failed
to
keep
even
the
common
law
of
the
land
most
of
these
young
people
had
broken
the
law
in
their
blundering
efforts
to
find
adventure
and
in
response
to
the
old
impulse
for
it
is
said
indeed
that
practically
the
whole
machinery
of
the
grand
jury
and
of
the
criminal
courts
is
maintained
and
operated
for
the
benefit
of
youths
between
the
ages
of
thirteen
and
men
up
to
ninety
years
of
age
it
is
true
commit
crimes
but
they
are
not
characterized
by
the
recklessness
the
bravado
and
the
horror
which
have
stained
our
records
in
chicago
an
adult
with
the
most
sordid
experience
of
life
and
the
most
rudimentary
notion
of
prudence
could
not
possibly
have
committed
them
only
a
utilization
of
that
sudden
burst
of
energy
belonging
partly
to
the
future
could
have
achieved
them
only
a
capture
of
the
imagination
and
of
the
deepest
emotions
of
youth
could
have
prevented
them
possibly
these
fifteen
thousand
youths
were
brought
to
grief
because
the
adult
population
assumed
that
the
young
would
be
able
to
grasp
only
that
which
is
presented
in
the
form
of
sensation
as
if
they
believed
that
youth
could
thus
early
become
absorbed
in
a
hand
to
mouth
existence
and
so
entangled
in
materialism
that
there
would
be
no
reaction
against
it
it
is
as
though
we
were
deaf
to
the
appeal
of
these
young
creatures
claiming
their
share
of
the
joy
of
life
flinging
out
into
the
dingy
city
their
desires
and
aspirations
after
unknown
realities
their
unutterable
longings
for
companionship
and
pleasure
their
very
demand
for
excitement
is
a
protest
against
the
dullness
of
life
to
which
we
ourselves
instinctively
respond
chapter
iv
the
house
of
dreams
to
the
preoccupied
adult
who
is
prone
to
use
the
city
street
as
a
mere
passageway
from
one
hurried
duty
to
another
nothing
is
more
touching
than
his
encounter
with
a
group
of
children
and
young
people
who
are
emerging
from
a
theater
with
the
magic
of
the
play
still
thick
upon
them
they
look
up
and
down
the
familiar
street
scarcely
recognizing
it
and
quite
unable
to
determine
the
direction
of
home
from
a
tangle
of
make
believe
they
gravely
scrutinize
the
real
world
which
they
are
so
reluctant
to
re√´nter
reminding
one
of
the
absorbed
gaze
of
a
child
who
is
groping
his
way
back
from
whither
the
story
has
completely
transported
him
going
to
the
show
for
thousands
of
young
people
in
every
industrial
city
is
the
only
possible
road
to
the
realms
of
mystery
and
romance
the
theater
is
the
only
place
where
they
can
satisfy
that
craving
for
a
conception
of
life
higher
than
that
which
the
actual
world
offers
them
in
a
very
real
sense
the
drama
and
the
drama
alone
performs
for
them
the
office
of
art
as
is
clearly
revealed
in
their
blundering
demand
stated
in
many
forms
for
a
play
unlike
life
the
theater
becomes
to
them
a
veritable
house
of
dreams
infinitely
more
real
than
the
noisy
streets
and
the
crowded
factories
this
first
simple
demand
upon
the
theater
for
romance
is
closely
allied
to
one
more
complex
which
might
be
described
as
a
search
for
solace
and
distraction
in
those
moments
of
first
awakening
from
the
glamour
of
a
youth
interpretation
of
life
to
the
sterner
realities
which
are
thrust
upon
his
consciousness
these
perceptions
which
inevitably
close
around
and
imprison
the
spirit
of
youth
are
perhaps
never
so
grim
as
in
the
case
of
the
child
we
can
all
recall
our
own
moments
of
revolt
against
life
actualities
our
reluctance
to
admit
that
all
life
was
to
be
as
unheroic
and
uneventful
as
that
which
we
saw
about
us
it
was
too
unbearable
that
this
was
all
there
was
and
we
tried
every
possible
avenue
of
escape
as
we
made
an
effort
to
believe
in
spite
of
what
we
saw
that
life
was
noble
and
harmonious
as
we
stubbornly
clung
to
poesy
in
contradiction
to
the
testimony
of
our
senses
so
we
see
thousands
of
young
people
thronging
the
theaters
bent
in
their
turn
upon
the
same
quest
the
drama
provides
a
transition
between
the
romantic
conceptions
which
they
vainly
struggle
to
keep
intact
and
life
cruelties
and
trivialities
which
they
refuse
to
admit
a
child
whose
imagination
has
been
cultivated
is
able
to
do
this
for
himself
through
reading
and
reverie
but
for
the
overworked
city
youth
of
meager
education
perhaps
nothing
but
the
theater
is
able
to
perform
this
important
office
the
theater
also
has
a
strange
power
to
forecast
life
for
the
youth
each
boy
comes
from
our
ancestral
past
not
in
entire
forgetfulness
and
quite
as
he
unconsciously
uses
ancient
in
his
street
play
so
he
longs
to
reproduce
and
to
see
set
before
him
the
valors
and
vengeances
of
a
society
embodying
a
much
more
primitive
state
of
morality
than
that
in
which
he
finds
himself
patten
has
pointed
out
that
the
elemental
action
which
the
stage
presents
the
old
emotions
of
love
and
jealousy
of
revenge
and
daring
take
the
thoughts
of
the
spectator
back
into
deep
and
well
worn
channels
in
which
his
mind
runs
with
a
sense
of
rest
afforded
by
nothing
else
the
cheap
drama
brings
cause
and
effect
will
power
and
action
once
more
into
relation
and
gives
a
man
the
thrilling
conviction
that
he
may
yet
be
master
of
his
fate
the
youth
of
course
quite
unconscious
of
this
psychology
views
the
deeds
of
the
hero
simply
as
a
forecast
of
his
own
future
and
it
is
this
fascinating
view
of
his
own
career
which
draws
the
boy
to
shows
of
all
sorts
they
can
scarcely
be
too
improbable
for
him
portraying
as
they
do
his
belief
in
his
own
prowess
a
series
of
slides
which
has
lately
been
very
popular
in
the
theaters
of
chicago
portrayed
five
masked
men
breaking
into
a
humble
dwelling
killing
the
father
of
the
family
and
carrying
away
the
family
treasure
the
son
of
the
house
aged
seven
vows
eternal
vengeance
on
the
spot
and
follows
one
villain
after
another
to
his
doom
the
execution
of
each
is
shown
in
lurid
detail
and
the
last
slide
of
the
series
depicts
the
hero
aged
ten
kneeling
upon
his
father
grave
counting
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
the
number
of
men
that
he
has
killed
and
thanking
god
that
he
has
been
permitted
to
be
an
instrument
of
vengeance
in
another
series
of
slides
a
poor
woman
is
wearily
bending
over
some
sewing
a
baby
is
crying
in
the
cradle
and
two
little
boys
of
nine
and
ten
are
asking
for
food
in
despair
the
mother
sends
them
out
into
the
street
to
beg
but
instead
they
steal
a
revolver
from
a
pawn
shop
and
with
it
kill
a
chinese
robbing
him
of
they
rush
home
with
the
treasure
which
is
found
by
the
mother
in
the
cradle
whereupon
she
and
her
sons
fall
upon
their
knees
and
send
up
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
for
this
timely
and
assistance
is
it
not
astounding
that
a
city
allows
thousands
of
its
youth
to
fill
their
impressionable
minds
with
these
absurdities
which
certainly
will
become
the
foundation
for
their
working
moral
codes
and
the
data
from
which
they
will
judge
the
proprieties
of
life
it
is
as
if
a
child
starved
at
home
should
be
forced
to
go
out
and
search
for
food
selecting
quite
naturally
not
that
which
is
nourishing
but
that
which
is
exciting
and
appealing
to
his
outward
sense
often
in
his
ignorance
and
foolishness
blundering
into
substances
which
are
filthy
and
poisonous
out
of
my
twenty
years
experience
at
i
can
recall
all
sorts
of
pilferings
petty
larcenies
and
even
burglaries
due
to
that
never
ceasing
effort
on
the
part
of
boys
to
procure
theater
tickets
i
can
also
recall
indirect
efforts
towards
the
same
end
which
are
most
pitiful
i
remember
the
remorse
of
a
young
girl
of
fifteen
who
was
brought
into
the
juvenile
court
after
a
night
spent
weeping
in
the
cellar
of
her
home
because
she
had
stolen
a
mass
of
artificial
flowers
with
which
to
trim
a
hat
she
stated
that
she
had
taken
the
flowers
because
she
was
afraid
of
losing
the
attention
of
a
young
man
whom
she
had
heard
say
that
a
girl
has
to
be
dressy
if
she
expects
to
be
seen
this
young
man
was
the
only
one
who
had
ever
taken
her
to
the
theater
and
if
he
failed
her
she
was
sure
that
she
would
never
go
again
and
she
sobbed
out
incoherently
that
she
could
live
at
all
without
it
apparently
the
blankness
and
grayness
of
life
itself
had
been
broken
for
her
only
by
the
portrayal
of
a
different
world
one
boy
whom
i
had
known
from
babyhood
began
to
take
money
from
his
mother
from
the
time
he
was
seven
years
old
and
after
he
was
ten
she
regularly
gave
him
money
for
the
play
saturday
evening
however
the
saturday
performance
starting
him
off
like
he
always
went
twice
again
on
sunday
procuring
the
money
in
all
sorts
of
illicit
ways
practically
all
of
his
earnings
after
he
was
fourteen
were
spent
in
this
way
to
satisfy
the
insatiable
desire
to
know
of
the
great
adventures
of
the
wide
world
which
the
more
fortunate
boy
takes
out
in
reading
homer
and
stevenson
in
talking
with
his
mother
i
was
reminded
of
my
experience
one
sunday
afternoon
in
russia
when
the
employees
of
a
large
factory
were
seated
in
an
theater
watching
with
breathless
interest
the
presentation
of
folk
stories
i
was
told
that
troupes
of
actors
went
from
one
manufacturing
establishment
to
another
presenting
the
simple
elements
of
history
and
literature
to
the
illiterate
employees
this
tendency
to
slake
the
thirst
for
adventure
by
viewing
the
drama
is
of
course
but
a
blind
and
primitive
effort
in
the
direction
of
culture
for
he
who
makes
himself
its
vessel
and
bearer
thereby
acquires
a
freedom
from
the
blindness
and
soul
poverty
of
daily
existence
it
is
partly
in
response
to
this
need
that
more
sophisticated
young
people
often
go
to
the
theater
hoping
to
find
a
clue
to
perplexities
many
times
the
bewildered
hero
reminds
one
of
description
of
margaret
fuller
i
do
know
where
i
am
going
follow
me
nevertheless
the
stage
is
dealing
with
the
moral
themes
in
which
the
public
is
most
interested
and
while
many
young
people
go
to
the
theater
if
only
to
see
represented
and
to
hear
discussed
the
themes
which
seem
to
them
so
tragically
important
there
is
no
doubt
that
what
they
hear
there
flimsy
and
poor
as
it
often
is
easily
becomes
their
actual
moral
guide
in
moments
of
moral
crisis
they
turn
to
the
sayings
of
the
hero
who
found
himself
in
a
similar
plight
the
sayings
may
not
be
profound
but
at
least
they
are
applicable
to
conduct
in
the
last
few
years
scores
of
plays
have
been
put
upon
the
stage
whose
titles
might
be
easily
translated
into
proper
headings
for
sociological
lectures
or
sermons
without
including
the
plays
of
ibsen
shaw
and
hauptmann
which
deal
so
directly
with
moral
issues
that
the
moralists
themselves
wince
under
their
teachings
and
declare
them
brutal
but
it
is
this
very
brutality
which
the
and
complicated
city
dwellers
often
crave
moral
teaching
has
become
so
intricate
creeds
so
metaphysical
that
in
a
state
of
absolute
reaction
they
demand
definite
instruction
for
daily
living
their
acceptance
of
the
teaching
corroborates
the
statement
recently
made
by
an
english
playwright
that
the
theater
is
literally
making
the
minds
of
our
urban
populations
it
is
a
huge
factory
of
sentiment
of
character
of
points
of
honor
of
conceptions
of
conduct
of
everything
that
finally
determines
the
destiny
of
a
nation
the
theater
is
not
only
a
place
of
amusement
it
is
a
place
of
culture
a
place
where
people
learn
how
to
think
act
and
feel
seldom
however
do
we
associate
the
theater
with
our
plans
for
civic
righteousness
although
it
has
become
so
important
a
factor
in
city
life
one
sunday
evening
last
winter
an
investigation
was
made
of
four
hundred
and
sixty
six
theaters
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
it
was
discovered
that
in
the
majority
of
them
the
leading
theme
was
revenge
the
lover
following
his
rival
the
outraged
husband
seeking
his
paramour
or
the
wiping
out
by
death
of
a
blot
on
a
hitherto
unstained
honor
it
was
estimated
that
one
sixth
of
the
entire
population
of
the
city
had
attended
the
theaters
on
that
day
at
that
same
moment
the
churches
throughout
the
city
were
preaching
the
gospel
of
good
will
is
not
this
a
striking
commentary
upon
the
contradictory
influences
to
which
the
city
youth
is
constantly
subjected
this
discrepancy
between
the
church
and
the
stage
is
at
times
apparently
recognized
by
the
theater
itself
and
a
blundering
attempt
is
made
to
suffuse
the
songs
and
moving
pictures
with
piety
nothing
could
more
absurdly
demonstrate
this
attempt
than
a
song
illustrated
by
pictures
describing
the
adventures
of
a
young
man
who
follows
a
pretty
girl
through
street
after
street
in
the
hope
of
snatching
a
kiss
from
her
ruby
lips
the
young
man
is
overjoyed
when
a
sudden
wind
storm
drives
the
girl
to
shelter
under
an
archway
and
he
is
about
to
succeed
in
his
attempt
when
the
good
lord
ever
watchful
over
innocence
makes
the
same
wind
blow
a
cloud
of
dust
into
the
eyes
of
the
rubberneck
and
his
foul
purpose
is
foiled
this
attempt
at
piety
is
also
shown
in
a
series
of
films
depicting
bible
stories
and
the
passion
play
at
oberammergau
forecasting
the
time
when
the
moving
film
will
be
viewed
as
a
mere
mechanical
device
for
the
use
of
the
church
the
school
and
the
library
as
well
as
for
the
theater
at
present
however
most
improbable
tales
hold
the
attention
of
the
youth
of
the
city
night
after
night
and
feed
his
starved
imagination
as
nothing
else
succeeds
in
doing
in
addition
to
these
fascinations
the
theater
is
also
fast
becoming
the
general
social
center
and
club
house
in
many
crowded
neighborhoods
it
is
easy
of
access
from
the
street
the
entire
family
of
parents
and
children
can
attend
for
a
comparatively
small
sum
of
money
and
the
performance
lasts
for
at
least
an
hour
and
in
some
of
the
humbler
theaters
the
spectators
are
not
disturbed
for
a
second
hour
the
room
which
contains
the
mimic
stage
is
small
and
cozy
and
less
formal
than
the
regular
theater
and
there
is
much
more
gossip
and
social
life
as
if
the
foyer
and
pit
were
mingled
the
very
darkness
of
the
room
necessary
for
an
exhibition
of
the
films
is
an
added
attraction
to
many
young
people
for
whom
the
space
is
filled
with
the
glamour
of
love
making
hundreds
of
young
people
attend
these
theaters
every
evening
in
the
week
including
sunday
and
what
is
seen
and
heard
there
becomes
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
forming
the
ground
pattern
of
their
social
life
that
mutual
understanding
which
in
another
social
circle
is
provided
by
books
travel
and
all
the
arts
is
here
compressed
into
the
topics
suggested
by
the
play
the
young
people
attend
the
theaters
in
groups
with
something
of
the
gang
instinct
boasting
of
the
films
and
stunts
in
our
theater
they
find
a
certain
advantage
in
attending
one
theater
regularly
for
the
are
often
invited
to
come
upon
the
stage
on
amateur
nights
which
occur
at
least
once
a
week
in
all
the
theaters
this
is
of
course
a
most
exciting
experience
if
the
stunt
does
not
meet
with
the
approval
of
the
audience
the
performer
is
greeted
with
jeers
and
a
long
hook
pulls
him
off
the
stage
if
on
the
other
hand
he
succeeds
in
pleasing
the
audience
he
may
be
paid
for
his
performance
and
later
register
with
a
booking
agency
the
address
of
which
is
supplied
by
the
obliging
manager
and
thus
he
fancies
that
a
lucrative
and
exciting
career
is
opening
before
him
almost
every
night
at
six
a
long
line
of
children
may
be
seen
waiting
at
the
entrance
of
these
booking
agencies
of
which
there
are
fifteen
that
are
well
known
in
chicago
thus
the
only
art
which
is
constantly
placed
before
the
eyes
of
the
temperamental
youth
is
a
debased
form
of
dramatic
art
and
a
vulgar
type
of
music
for
the
success
of
a
song
in
these
theaters
depends
not
so
much
upon
its
musical
rendition
as
upon
the
vulgarity
of
its
appeal
in
a
song
which
held
the
stage
of
a
cheap
theater
in
chicago
for
weeks
the
young
singer
was
helped
out
by
a
bit
of
mirror
from
which
she
threw
a
flash
of
light
into
the
faces
of
successive
boys
whom
she
selected
from
the
audience
as
she
sang
the
refrain
you
are
my
affinity
many
popular
songs
relate
the
vulgar
experiences
of
a
city
man
wandering
from
amusement
park
to
bathing
beach
in
search
of
flirtations
it
may
be
that
these
stunts
and
recitals
of
city
adventure
contain
the
nucleus
of
coming
poesy
and
romance
as
the
songs
and
recitals
of
the
early
minstrels
sprang
directly
from
the
life
of
the
people
but
all
the
more
does
the
effort
need
help
and
direction
both
in
the
development
of
its
technique
and
the
material
of
its
themes
the
few
attempts
which
have
been
made
in
this
direction
are
astonishingly
rewarding
to
those
who
regard
the
power
of
as
one
of
the
most
precious
boons
of
education
the
children
theater
in
new
york
is
the
most
successful
example
but
every
settlement
in
which
dramatics
have
been
systematically
fostered
can
also
testify
to
a
surprisingly
quick
response
to
this
form
of
art
on
the
part
of
young
people
the
theater
is
constantly
besieged
by
children
clamoring
to
take
part
in
the
plays
of
schiller
shakespeare
and
moli√®re
although
they
know
it
means
weeks
of
rehearsal
and
the
complete
memorizing
of
stiff
lines
the
audiences
sit
enthralled
by
the
final
rendition
and
other
children
whose
tastes
have
supposedly
been
debased
by
constant
vaudeville
are
pathetically
eager
to
come
again
and
again
even
when
still
more
is
required
from
the
young
actors
research
into
the
special
historic
period
copying
costumes
from
old
plates
hours
of
labor
that
the
th
may
be
restored
to
its
proper
place
in
english
speech
their
enthusiasm
is
unquenched
but
quite
aside
from
its
educational
possibilities
one
never
ceases
to
marvel
at
the
power
of
even
a
mimic
stage
to
afford
to
the
young
a
magic
space
in
which
life
may
be
lived
in
efflorescence
where
manners
may
be
courtly
and
elaborate
without
exciting
ridicule
where
the
sequence
of
events
is
impressive
and
comprehensible
order
and
beauty
of
life
is
what
the
adolescent
youth
craves
above
all
else
as
the
younger
child
indefatigably
demands
his
story
is
this
where
the
most
beautiful
princess
in
the
world
lives
asks
a
little
girl
peering
into
the
door
of
the
theater
or
does
alice
in
wonderland
always
stay
here
it
is
much
easier
for
her
to
put
her
feeling
into
words
than
it
is
for
the
youth
who
has
enchantingly
rendered
the
gentle
poetry
of
ben
jonson
sad
shepherd
or
for
him
who
has
walked
the
boards
as
southey
wat
tyler
his
association
however
is
quite
as
clinging
and
magical
as
is
the
child
although
he
can
only
say
gee
i
wish
i
could
always
feel
the
way
i
did
that
night
something
would
be
doing
then
nothing
of
the
artist
pleasure
nor
of
the
revelation
of
that
larger
world
which
surrounds
and
completes
our
own
is
lost
to
him
because
a
careful
technique
has
been
exacted
on
the
contrary
this
has
only
dignified
and
enhanced
it
it
would
also
be
easy
to
illustrate
eagerness
for
artistic
expression
from
the
recitals
given
by
the
pupils
of
the
new
york
music
school
settlement
or
by
those
of
the
music
school
these
attempts
also
combine
social
life
with
the
training
of
the
artistic
sense
and
in
this
approximate
the
fascinations
of
the
theater
this
spring
a
group
of
young
girls
accustomed
to
the
life
of
a
theater
reluctantly
refused
an
invitation
to
go
to
the
country
for
a
day
outing
because
the
return
on
a
late
train
would
compel
them
to
miss
one
evening
performance
they
found
it
impossible
to
tear
themselves
away
not
only
from
the
excitements
of
the
theater
itself
but
from
the
gaiety
of
the
crowd
of
young
men
and
girls
invariably
gathered
outside
discussing
the
sensational
posters
a
steady
english
shopkeeper
lately
complained
that
unless
he
provided
his
four
daughters
with
the
money
for
the
theaters
every
evening
they
would
steal
it
from
his
till
and
he
feared
that
they
might
be
driven
to
procure
it
in
even
more
illicit
ways
because
his
entire
family
life
had
been
thus
disrupted
he
gloomily
asserted
that
this
cheap
show
had
ruined
his
and
was
the
curse
of
america
this
father
was
able
to
formulate
the
anxiety
of
many
immigrant
parents
who
are
absolutely
bewildered
by
the
keen
absorption
of
their
children
in
the
cheap
theater
this
anxiety
is
not
indeed
without
foundation
an
eminent
alienist
of
chicago
states
that
he
has
had
a
number
of
patients
among
neurotic
children
whose
emotional
natures
have
been
so
by
the
crude
appeal
to
which
they
had
been
so
constantly
subjected
in
the
theaters
that
they
have
become
victims
of
hallucination
and
mental
disorder
the
statement
of
this
physician
may
be
the
first
note
of
alarm
which
will
awaken
the
city
to
its
duty
in
regard
to
the
theater
so
that
it
shall
at
least
be
made
safe
and
sane
for
the
city
child
whose
senses
are
already
so
abnormally
developed
this
testimony
of
a
physician
that
the
conditions
are
actually
pathological
may
at
last
induce
us
to
bestir
ourselves
in
regard
to
procuring
a
more
wholesome
form
of
public
recreation
many
efforts
in
social
amelioration
have
been
undertaken
only
after
such
exposures
in
the
meantime
while
the
occasional
child
is
driven
distraught
a
hundred
children
permanently
injure
their
eyes
watching
the
moving
films
and
hundreds
more
seriously
model
their
conduct
upon
the
standards
set
before
them
on
this
mimic
stage
three
boys
aged
nine
eleven
and
thirteen
years
who
had
recently
seen
depicted
the
adventures
of
frontier
life
including
the
holding
up
of
a
stage
coach
and
the
lassoing
of
the
driver
spent
weeks
planning
to
lasso
murder
and
rob
a
neighborhood
milkman
who
started
on
his
route
at
four
in
the
morning
they
made
their
headquarters
in
a
barn
and
saved
enough
money
to
buy
a
revolver
adopting
as
their
watchword
the
phrase
dead
men
tell
no
tales
one
spring
morning
the
conspirators
with
their
faces
covered
with
black
cloth
lay
in
ambush
for
the
milkman
fortunately
for
him
as
the
lariat
was
thrown
the
horse
shied
and
although
the
shot
was
appropriately
fired
the
milkman
life
was
saved
such
a
direct
influence
of
the
theater
is
by
no
means
rare
even
among
older
boys
thirteen
young
lads
were
brought
into
the
municipal
court
in
chicago
during
the
first
week
that
raffles
the
amateur
cracksman
was
upon
the
stage
each
one
with
an
outfit
of
burglar
tools
in
his
possession
and
each
one
shamefacedly
admitting
that
the
gentlemanly
burglar
in
the
play
had
suggested
to
him
a
career
of
similar
adventure
in
so
far
as
the
illusions
of
the
theater
succeed
in
giving
youth
the
rest
and
recreation
which
comes
from
following
a
more
primitive
code
of
morality
it
has
a
close
relation
to
the
function
performed
by
public
games
it
is
of
course
less
valuable
because
the
sense
of
participation
is
largely
confined
to
the
emotions
and
the
imagination
and
does
not
involve
the
entire
nature
we
might
illustrate
by
the
wild
west
show
in
which
the
onlooking
boy
imagines
himself
an
active
participant
the
scouts
the
indians
the
bucking
ponies
are
his
real
intimate
companions
and
occupy
his
entire
mind
in
contrast
with
this
we
have
the
omnipresent
game
of
tag
which
is
doubtless
also
founded
upon
the
chase
it
gives
the
boy
exercise
and
momentary
echoes
of
the
old
excitement
but
it
is
barren
of
suggestion
and
quickly
degenerates
into
well
considered
public
games
easily
carried
out
in
a
park
or
athletic
field
might
both
fill
the
mind
with
the
imaginative
material
constantly
supplied
by
the
theater
and
also
afford
the
activity
which
the
cramped
muscles
of
the
town
dweller
so
sorely
need
even
the
unquestioned
ability
which
the
theater
possesses
to
bring
men
together
into
a
common
mood
and
to
afford
them
a
mutual
topic
of
conversation
is
better
accomplished
with
the
one
national
game
which
we
already
possess
and
might
be
infinitely
extended
through
the
organization
of
other
public
games
the
theater
even
now
by
no
means
competes
with
the
baseball
league
games
which
are
attended
by
thousands
of
men
and
boys
who
during
the
entire
summer
discuss
the
respective
standing
of
each
nine
and
the
relative
merits
of
every
player
during
the
noon
hour
all
the
employees
of
a
city
factory
gather
in
the
nearest
vacant
lot
to
cheer
their
own
home
team
in
its
practice
for
the
next
game
with
the
nine
of
a
neighboring
manufacturing
establishment
and
on
a
saturday
afternoon
the
entire
male
population
of
the
city
betakes
itself
to
the
baseball
field
the
ordinary
means
of
transportation
are
supplemented
by
gay
and
huge
automobiles
noisy
with
blowing
horns
and
decked
with
gay
pennants
the
enormous
crowd
of
cheering
men
and
boys
are
talkative
full
of
the
holiday
spirit
and
absolutely
released
from
the
grind
of
life
they
are
lifted
out
of
their
individual
affairs
and
so
fused
together
that
a
man
can
not
tell
whether
it
is
his
own
shout
or
another
that
fills
his
ears
whether
it
is
his
own
coat
or
another
that
he
is
wildly
waving
to
celebrate
a
victory
he
does
not
call
the
stranger
who
sits
next
to
him
his
brother
but
he
unconsciously
embraces
him
in
an
overwhelming
outburst
of
kindly
feeling
when
the
favorite
player
makes
a
home
run
does
not
this
contain
a
suggestion
of
the
undoubted
power
of
public
recreation
to
bring
together
all
classes
of
a
community
in
the
modern
city
unhappily
so
full
of
devices
for
keeping
men
apart
already
some
american
cities
are
making
a
beginning
toward
more
adequate
public
recreation
boston
has
its
municipal
gymnasiums
cricket
fields
and
golf
grounds
chicago
has
seventeen
parks
with
playing
fields
gymnasiums
and
baths
which
at
present
enroll
thousands
of
young
people
these
same
parks
are
provided
with
beautiful
halls
which
are
used
for
many
purposes
rent
free
and
are
given
over
to
any
group
of
young
people
who
wish
to
conduct
dancing
parties
subject
to
city
supervision
and
chaperonage
many
social
clubs
have
deserted
neighboring
saloon
halls
for
these
municipal
drawing
rooms
beautifully
decorated
with
growing
plants
supplied
by
the
park
greenhouses
and
flooded
with
electric
lights
supplied
by
the
park
power
house
in
the
saloon
halls
the
young
people
were
obliged
to
pass
money
freely
over
the
bar
and
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
the
occasion
they
usually
stayed
until
morning
at
such
times
the
economic
necessity
itself
would
override
the
counsels
of
the
more
temperate
and
the
thrifty
door
keeper
would
not
insist
upon
invitations
but
would
take
in
any
one
who
had
the
price
of
a
ticket
the
free
rent
in
the
park
hall
the
good
food
in
the
park
restaurant
supplied
at
cost
have
made
three
parties
closing
at
eleven
no
more
expensive
than
one
party
breaking
up
at
daylight
too
often
in
disorder
is
not
this
an
argument
that
the
drinking
the
late
hours
the
lack
of
decorum
are
directly
traceable
to
the
commercial
enterprise
which
ministers
to
pleasure
in
order
to
drag
it
into
excess
because
excess
is
more
profitable
to
thus
commercialize
pleasure
is
as
monstrous
as
it
is
to
commercialize
art
it
is
intolerable
that
the
city
does
not
take
over
this
function
of
making
provision
for
pleasure
as
wise
communities
in
sweden
and
south
carolina
have
taken
the
sale
of
alcohol
out
of
the
hands
of
enterprising
publicans
we
are
only
beginning
to
understand
what
might
be
done
through
the
festival
the
street
procession
the
band
of
marching
musicians
orchestral
music
in
public
squares
or
parks
with
the
magic
power
they
all
possess
to
formulate
the
sense
of
companionship
and
solidarity
the
experiments
which
are
being
made
in
public
schools
to
celebrate
the
national
holidays
the
changing
seasons
the
birthdays
of
heroes
the
planting
of
trees
are
slowly
developing
little
ceremonials
which
may
in
time
work
out
into
pageants
of
genuine
beauty
and
significance
no
other
nation
has
so
unparalleled
an
opportunity
to
do
this
through
its
schools
as
we
have
for
no
other
nation
has
so
a
school
system
while
the
enthusiasm
of
children
and
their
natural
ability
to
express
their
emotions
through
symbols
gives
the
securest
possible
foundation
to
this
growing
effort
the
city
schools
of
new
york
have
effected
the
organization
of
high
school
girls
into
groups
for
folk
dancing
these
old
forms
of
dancing
which
have
been
worked
out
in
many
lands
and
through
long
experiences
safeguard
unwary
and
dangerous
expression
and
yet
afford
a
vehicle
through
which
the
gaiety
of
youth
may
flow
their
forms
are
indeed
those
which
lie
at
the
basis
of
all
good
breeding
forms
which
at
once
express
and
restrain
urge
forward
and
set
limits
one
may
also
see
another
center
of
growth
for
public
recreation
and
the
beginning
of
a
pageantry
for
the
people
in
the
many
small
parks
and
athletic
fields
which
almost
every
american
city
is
hastening
to
provide
for
its
young
these
small
parks
have
innumerable
athletic
teams
each
with
its
distinctive
uniform
with
track
meets
and
match
games
arranged
with
the
teams
from
other
parks
and
from
the
public
schools
choruses
of
trade
unionists
or
of
patriotic
societies
fill
the
park
halls
with
eager
listeners
labor
day
processions
are
yearly
becoming
more
carefully
planned
and
more
picturesque
in
character
as
the
desire
to
make
an
overwhelming
impression
with
mere
size
gives
way
to
a
growing
ambition
to
set
forth
the
significance
of
the
craft
and
the
skill
of
the
workman
at
moments
they
almost
rival
the
dignified
showing
of
the
processions
of
the
german
turn
vereins
which
are
also
often
seen
in
our
city
streets
the
many
foreign
colonies
which
are
found
in
all
american
cities
afford
an
enormous
reserve
of
material
for
public
recreation
and
street
festival
they
not
only
celebrate
the
feasts
and
holidays
of
the
fatherland
but
have
each
their
own
public
expression
for
their
mutual
benefit
societies
and
for
the
observance
of
american
anniversaries
from
the
gay
celebration
of
the
scandinavians
when
war
was
averted
and
two
neighboring
nations
were
united
to
the
equally
gay
celebration
of
the
centenary
of
garibaldi
birth
from
the
chinese
dragon
cleverly
trailing
its
way
through
the
streets
to
the
greek
banners
flung
out
in
honor
of
immortal
heroes
there
is
an
infinite
variety
of
suggestions
and
possibilities
for
public
recreation
and
for
the
corporate
expression
of
stirring
emotions
after
all
what
is
the
function
of
art
but
to
preserve
in
permanent
and
beautiful
form
those
emotions
and
solaces
which
cheer
life
and
make
it
kindlier
more
heroic
and
easier
to
comprehend
which
lift
the
mind
of
the
worker
from
the
harshness
and
loneliness
of
his
task
and
by
connecting
him
with
what
has
gone
before
free
him
from
a
sense
of
isolation
and
hardship
were
american
cities
really
eager
for
municipal
art
they
would
cherish
as
genuine
beginnings
the
tarentella
danced
so
interminably
at
italian
weddings
the
primitive
greek
pipe
played
throughout
the
long
summer
nights
the
bohemian
theaters
crowded
with
eager
slavophiles
the
hungarian
musicians
strolling
from
street
to
street
the
fervid
oratory
of
the
young
russian
preaching
social
righteousness
in
the
open
square
many
chicago
citizens
who
attended
the
first
annual
meeting
of
the
national
playground
association
of
america
will
never
forget
the
long
summer
day
in
the
large
playing
field
filled
during
the
morning
with
hundreds
of
little
children
romping
through
the
kindergarten
games
in
the
afternoon
with
the
young
men
and
girls
contending
in
athletic
sports
and
the
evening
light
made
gay
by
the
bright
colored
garments
of
italians
lithuanians
norwegians
and
a
dozen
other
nationalities
reproducing
their
old
dances
and
festivals
for
the
pleasure
of
the
more
stolid
americans
was
this
a
forecast
of
what
we
may
yet
see
accomplished
through
a
dozen
agencies
promoting
public
recreation
which
are
springing
up
in
every
city
of
america
as
they
already
are
found
in
the
large
towns
of
scotland
and
england
let
us
cherish
these
experiments
as
the
most
precious
beginnings
of
an
attempt
to
supply
the
recreational
needs
of
our
industrial
cities
to
fail
to
provide
for
the
recreation
of
youth
is
not
only
to
deprive
all
of
them
of
their
natural
form
of
expression
but
is
certain
to
subject
some
of
them
to
the
overwhelming
temptation
of
illicit
and
pleasures
to
insist
that
young
people
shall
forecast
their
future
only
in
a
house
of
dreams
is
to
deprive
the
real
world
of
that
warmth
and
reassurance
which
it
so
sorely
needs
and
to
which
it
is
justly
entitled
furthermore
we
are
left
outside
with
a
sense
of
dreariness
in
company
with
that
shadow
which
already
lurks
only
around
the
corner
for
most
of
us
a
skepticism
of
life
value
chapter
v
the
spirit
of
youth
and
industry
as
it
is
possible
to
establish
a
connection
between
the
lack
of
public
recreation
and
the
vicious
excitements
and
trivial
amusements
which
become
their
substitutes
so
it
may
be
illuminating
to
trace
the
connection
between
the
monotony
and
dullness
of
factory
work
and
the
petty
immoralities
which
are
often
the
youth
protest
against
them
there
are
many
city
neighborhoods
in
which
practically
every
young
person
who
has
attained
the
age
of
fourteen
years
enters
a
factory
when
the
work
itself
offers
nothing
of
interest
and
when
no
public
provision
is
made
for
recreation
the
situation
becomes
almost
insupportable
to
the
youth
whose
ancestors
have
been
and
peasants
in
such
neighborhoods
the
joy
of
youth
is
well
nigh
extinguished
and
in
that
long
procession
of
factory
workers
each
morning
and
evening
the
young
walk
almost
as
wearily
and
listlessly
as
the
old
young
people
working
in
modern
factories
situated
in
cities
still
dominated
by
the
ideals
of
puritanism
face
a
combination
which
tends
almost
irresistably
to
overwhelm
the
spirit
of
youth
when
the
puritan
repression
of
pleasure
was
in
the
ascendant
in
america
the
people
it
dealt
with
lived
on
farms
and
villages
where
although
youthful
pleasures
might
be
frowned
upon
and
crushed
out
the
young
people
still
had
a
chance
to
find
in
their
work
plowing
the
field
and
spinning
the
flax
could
be
carried
on
with
a
certain
joyousness
and
vigor
which
the
organization
of
modern
industry
too
often
precludes
present
industry
based
upon
the
inventions
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
little
connection
with
the
old
patterns
in
which
men
have
worked
for
generations
the
modern
factory
calls
for
an
expenditure
of
nervous
energy
almost
more
than
it
demands
muscular
effort
or
at
least
machinery
so
far
performs
the
work
of
the
massive
muscles
that
greater
stress
is
laid
upon
fine
and
exact
movements
necessarily
involving
nervous
strain
but
these
movements
are
exactly
of
the
type
to
which
the
muscles
of
a
growing
boy
least
readily
respond
quite
as
the
admonition
to
be
accurate
and
faithful
is
that
which
appeals
the
least
to
his
big
primitive
emotions
the
demands
made
upon
his
eyes
are
complicated
and
trivial
the
use
of
his
muscles
is
fussy
and
monotonous
the
relation
between
cause
and
effect
is
remote
and
obscure
apparently
no
one
is
concerned
as
to
what
may
be
done
to
aid
him
in
this
process
and
to
relieve
it
of
its
dullness
and
difficulty
to
mitigate
its
strain
and
harshness
perhaps
never
before
have
young
people
been
expected
to
work
from
motives
so
detached
from
direct
emotional
incentive
never
has
the
age
of
marriage
been
so
long
delayed
never
has
the
work
of
youth
been
so
separated
from
the
family
life
and
the
public
opinion
of
the
community
education
alone
can
repair
these
losses
it
alone
has
the
power
of
organizing
a
child
activities
with
some
reference
to
the
life
he
will
later
lead
and
of
giving
him
a
clue
as
to
what
to
select
and
what
to
eliminate
when
he
comes
into
contact
with
contemporary
social
and
industrial
conditions
and
until
educators
take
hold
of
the
situation
the
rest
of
the
community
is
powerless
in
vast
regions
of
the
city
which
are
completely
dominated
by
the
factory
it
is
as
if
the
development
of
industry
had
outrun
all
the
educational
and
social
arrangements
the
revolt
of
youth
against
uniformity
and
the
necessity
of
following
careful
directions
laid
down
by
some
one
else
many
times
results
in
such
nervous
irritability
that
the
youth
in
spite
of
all
sorts
of
prudential
reasons
throws
up
his
job
if
only
to
get
outside
the
factory
walls
into
the
freer
street
just
as
the
narrowness
of
the
school
inclosure
induces
many
a
boy
to
jump
the
fence
when
the
boy
is
on
the
street
however
and
is
standing
around
on
the
corner
with
the
gang
to
which
he
mysteriously
attaches
himself
he
finds
the
difficulties
of
direct
untrammeled
action
almost
as
great
there
as
they
were
in
the
factory
but
for
an
entirely
different
set
of
reasons
the
necessity
so
strongly
felt
in
the
factory
for
an
outlet
to
his
sudden
and
furious
bursts
of
energy
his
overmastering
desire
to
prove
that
he
could
do
things
without
being
bossed
all
the
time
finds
little
chance
for
expression
for
he
discovers
that
in
whatever
really
active
pursuit
he
tries
to
engage
he
is
promptly
suppressed
by
the
police
after
several
futile
attempts
at
he
returns
to
his
street
corner
subdued
and
so
far
discouraged
that
when
he
has
the
next
impulse
to
vigorous
action
he
concludes
that
it
is
of
no
use
and
sullenly
settles
back
into
inactivity
he
thus
learns
to
persuade
himself
that
it
is
better
to
do
nothing
or
as
the
psychologist
would
say
to
inhibit
his
motor
impulses
when
the
same
boy
as
an
adult
workman
finds
himself
confronted
with
an
unusual
or
an
untoward
condition
in
his
work
he
will
fall
back
into
this
habit
of
inhibition
of
making
no
effort
toward
independent
action
when
slack
times
come
he
will
be
the
workman
of
least
value
and
the
first
to
be
dismissed
calmly
accepting
his
position
in
the
ranks
of
the
unemployed
because
it
will
not
be
so
unlike
the
many
hours
of
idleness
and
vacuity
to
which
he
was
accustomed
as
a
boy
no
help
having
been
extended
to
him
in
the
moment
of
his
first
irritable
revolt
against
industry
his
whole
life
has
been
given
a
twist
toward
idleness
and
futility
he
has
not
had
the
chance
of
recovery
which
the
school
system
gives
a
like
rebellious
boy
in
a
truant
school
the
unjustifiable
lack
of
educational
supervision
during
the
first
years
of
factory
work
makes
it
quite
impossible
for
the
modern
educator
to
offer
any
real
assistance
to
young
people
during
that
trying
transitional
period
between
school
and
industry
the
young
people
themselves
who
fail
to
conform
can
do
little
but
rebel
against
the
entire
situation
and
the
expressions
of
revolt
roughly
divide
themselves
into
three
classes
the
first
resulting
in
idleness
may
be
illustrated
from
many
a
sad
story
of
a
boy
or
a
girl
who
has
spent
in
the
first
spurt
of
premature
and
uninteresting
work
all
the
energy
which
should
have
carried
them
through
years
of
steady
endeavor
i
recall
a
boy
who
had
worked
steadily
for
two
years
as
a
helper
in
a
smelting
establishment
and
had
conscientiously
brought
home
all
his
wages
one
night
suddenly
announcing
to
his
family
that
he
was
too
tired
and
too
hot
to
go
on
as
no
amount
of
persuasion
could
make
him
alter
his
decision
the
family
finally
threatened
to
bring
him
into
the
juvenile
court
on
a
charge
of
incorrigibility
whereupon
the
boy
disappeared
and
such
efforts
as
the
family
have
been
able
to
make
in
the
two
years
since
have
failed
to
find
him
they
are
convinced
that
he
is
trying
a
spell
of
tramping
and
wish
that
they
had
let
him
have
a
vacation
the
first
summer
when
he
wanted
it
so
bad
the
boy
may
find
in
the
rough
outdoor
life
the
healing
which
a
wise
physician
would
recommend
for
nervous
exhaustion
although
the
tramp
experiment
is
a
perilous
one
this
revolt
against
factory
monotony
is
sometimes
closely
allied
to
that
moral
fatigue
which
results
from
assuming
responsibility
prematurely
i
recall
the
experience
of
a
scotch
girl
of
eighteen
who
with
her
older
sister
worked
in
a
candy
factory
their
combined
earnings
supporting
a
paralytic
father
the
older
girl
met
with
an
accident
involving
the
loss
of
both
eyes
and
the
financial
support
of
the
whole
family
devolved
upon
the
younger
girl
who
worked
hard
and
conscientiously
for
three
years
supplementing
her
insufficient
factory
wages
by
evening
work
at
glove
making
in
the
midst
of
this
devotion
and
monotonous
existence
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
girl
who
was
a
chorus
singer
in
a
cheap
theater
and
the
contrast
between
her
monotonous
drudgery
and
the
glitter
of
the
stage
broke
down
her
allegiance
to
her
helpless
family
she
left
the
city
absolutely
abandoning
the
kindred
to
whom
she
had
been
so
long
devoted
and
announced
that
if
they
all
starved
she
would
never
go
into
a
factory
again
every
effort
failed
to
find
her
after
the
concert
troupe
left
milwaukee
and
although
the
pious
scotch
father
felt
that
she
had
been
ensnared
by
the
devil
and
had
brought
his
gray
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
i
could
not
quite
dismiss
the
case
with
this
simple
explanation
but
was
haunted
by
all
sorts
of
social
implications
the
second
line
of
revolt
manifests
itself
in
an
attempt
to
make
up
for
the
monotony
of
the
work
by
a
constant
change
from
one
occupation
to
another
this
is
an
almost
universal
experience
among
thousands
of
young
people
in
their
first
impact
with
the
industrial
world
the
startling
results
of
the
investigation
undertaken
in
massachusetts
by
the
douglas
commission
showed
how
casual
and
demoralizing
the
first
few
years
of
factory
life
become
to
thousands
of
unprepared
boys
and
girls
in
their
first
restlessness
and
maladjustment
they
change
from
one
factory
to
another
working
only
for
a
few
weeks
or
months
in
each
and
they
exhibit
no
interest
in
any
of
them
save
for
the
amount
of
wages
paid
at
the
end
of
their
second
year
of
employment
many
of
them
are
less
capable
than
when
they
left
school
and
are
actually
receiving
less
wages
the
report
of
the
commission
made
clear
that
while
the
two
years
between
fourteen
and
sixteen
were
most
valuable
for
educational
purposes
they
were
almost
useless
for
industrial
purposes
that
no
trade
would
receive
as
an
apprentice
a
boy
under
sixteen
that
no
industry
requiring
skill
and
workmanship
could
utilize
these
untrained
children
and
that
they
not
only
demoralized
themselves
but
in
a
sense
industry
itself
an
investigation
of
one
thousand
tenement
children
in
new
york
who
had
taken
out
their
working
papers
at
the
age
of
fourteen
reported
that
during
the
first
working
year
a
third
of
them
had
averaged
six
places
each
these
reports
but
confirm
the
experience
of
those
of
us
who
live
in
an
industrial
neighborhood
and
who
continually
see
these
restless
young
workers
in
fact
there
are
moments
when
this
constant
changing
seems
to
be
all
that
saves
them
from
the
fate
of
those
other
children
who
hold
on
to
a
monotonous
task
so
long
that
they
finally
incapacitate
themselves
for
all
work
it
often
seems
to
me
an
expression
of
the
instinct
of
as
in
the
case
of
a
young
swedish
boy
who
during
a
period
of
two
years
abandoned
one
piece
of
factory
work
after
another
saying
he
could
not
stand
it
until
in
the
chagrin
following
the
loss
of
his
ninth
place
he
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
the
city
and
allowing
his
mother
and
little
sisters
to
shift
for
themselves
at
this
critical
juncture
a
place
was
found
for
him
as
lineman
in
a
telephone
company
climbing
telephone
poles
and
handling
wires
apparently
supplied
him
with
the
elements
of
outdoor
activity
and
danger
which
were
necessary
to
hold
his
interest
and
he
became
the
steady
support
of
his
family
but
while
we
know
the
discouraging
effect
of
idleness
upon
the
boy
who
has
thrown
up
his
job
and
refuses
to
work
again
and
we
also
know
the
restlessness
and
lack
of
discipline
resulting
from
the
constant
change
from
one
factory
to
another
there
is
still
a
third
manifestation
of
maladjustment
of
which
one
memory
and
the
juvenile
court
records
unfortunately
furnish
many
examples
the
spirit
of
revolt
in
these
cases
has
led
to
distinct
disaster
two
stories
will
perhaps
be
sufficient
in
illustration
although
they
might
be
multiplied
indefinitely
from
my
own
experience
a
russian
girl
who
went
to
work
at
an
early
age
in
a
factory
pasting
labels
on
mucilage
bottles
was
obliged
to
surrender
all
her
wages
to
her
father
who
in
return
gave
her
only
the
barest
necessities
of
life
in
a
fit
of
revolt
against
the
monotony
of
her
work
and
that
nasty
sticky
stuff
she
stole
from
her
father
which
he
had
hidden
away
under
the
floor
of
his
kitchen
and
with
this
money
she
ran
away
to
a
neighboring
city
for
a
spree
having
first
bought
herself
the
most
gorgeous
clothing
a
local
department
store
could
supply
of
course
this
preposterous
beginning
could
have
but
one
ending
and
the
child
was
sent
to
the
reform
school
to
expiate
not
only
her
own
sins
but
the
sins
of
those
who
had
failed
to
rescue
her
from
a
life
of
grinding
monotony
which
her
spirit
could
not
brook
i
know
the
judge
thinks
i
am
a
bad
girl
sobbed
a
poor
little
prisoner
put
under
bonds
for
threatening
to
kill
her
lover
but
i
have
only
been
bad
for
one
week
and
before
that
i
was
good
for
six
years
i
worked
every
day
in
blank
factory
and
took
home
all
my
wages
to
keep
the
kids
in
school
i
met
this
fellow
in
a
dance
hall
i
just
had
to
go
to
dances
sometimes
after
pushing
down
the
lever
of
my
machine
with
my
right
foot
and
using
both
my
arms
feeding
it
for
ten
hours
a
day
nobody
knows
how
i
felt
some
nights
i
agreed
to
go
away
with
this
man
for
a
week
but
when
i
was
ready
to
go
home
he
tried
to
drive
me
out
on
the
street
to
earn
money
for
him
and
of
course
i
threatened
to
kill
him
any
decent
girl
would
she
concluded
as
unconscious
of
the
irony
of
the
reflection
as
she
was
of
the
connection
between
her
lurid
week
and
her
monotonous
years
knowing
as
educators
do
that
thousands
of
the
city
youth
will
enter
factory
life
at
an
age
as
early
as
the
state
law
will
permit
instructed
as
the
modern
teacher
is
as
to
youth
requirements
for
a
normal
mental
and
muscular
development
it
is
hard
to
understand
the
apathy
in
regard
to
youth
inevitable
experience
in
modern
industry
are
the
educators
like
the
rest
of
us
so
caught
in
admiration
of
the
astonishing
achievements
of
modern
industry
that
they
forget
the
children
themselves
a
scotch
educator
who
recently
visited
america
considered
it
very
strange
that
with
a
remarkable
industrial
development
all
about
us
affording
such
amazing
educational
opportunities
our
schools
should
continually
cling
to
a
past
which
did
not
fit
the
american
temperament
was
not
adapted
to
our
needs
and
made
no
vigorous
pull
upon
our
faculties
he
concluded
that
our
educators
overwhelmed
by
the
size
and
vigor
of
american
industry
were
too
timid
to
seize
upon
the
industrial
situation
and
to
extract
its
enormous
educational
value
he
lamented
that
this
lack
of
courage
and
initiative
failed
not
only
to
fit
the
child
for
an
intelligent
and
conscious
participation
in
industrial
life
but
that
it
was
reflected
in
the
industrial
development
itself
that
industry
had
fallen
back
into
old
habits
and
repeated
traditional
mistakes
until
american
cities
exhibited
stupendous
extensions
of
the
medievalisms
in
the
traditional
ghetto
and
of
the
hideousness
in
the
black
country
of
lancashire
he
contended
that
this
condition
is
the
inevitable
result
of
separating
education
from
contemporary
life
education
becomes
unreal
and
far
fetched
while
industry
becomes
ruthless
and
materialistic
in
spite
of
the
severity
of
the
indictment
one
much
more
severe
and
well
deserved
might
have
been
brought
against
us
he
might
have
accused
us
not
only
of
wasting
but
of
misusing
and
of
trampling
under
foot
the
first
tender
instincts
and
impulses
which
are
the
source
of
all
charm
and
beauty
and
art
because
we
fail
to
realize
that
by
premature
factory
work
for
which
the
youth
is
unprepared
society
perpetually
extinguishes
that
variety
and
promise
that
bloom
of
life
which
is
the
unique
possession
of
the
young
he
might
have
told
us
that
our
cities
would
continue
to
be
traditionally
cramped
and
dreary
until
we
comprehend
that
youth
alone
has
the
power
to
bring
to
reality
the
vision
of
the
coming
city
of
mankind
full
of
life
full
of
the
spirit
of
creation
a
few
educational
experiments
are
carried
on
in
cincinnati
in
boston
and
in
chicago
in
which
the
leaders
of
education
and
industry
unite
in
a
common
aim
and
purpose
a
few
more
are
carried
on
by
trade
unionists
who
in
at
least
two
of
the
trades
are
anxious
to
give
to
their
apprentices
and
journeymen
the
wider
culture
afforded
by
the
capitalistic
trade
schools
which
they
suspect
of
preparing
still
a
few
other
schools
have
been
founded
by
public
spirited
citizens
to
whom
the
situation
has
become
unendurable
and
one
or
two
more
such
experiments
are
attached
to
the
public
school
system
itself
all
of
these
schools
are
still
blundering
in
method
and
unsatisfactory
in
their
results
but
a
certain
trade
school
for
girls
in
new
york
which
is
preparing
young
girls
of
fourteen
for
the
sewing
trade
already
so
overcrowded
and
subdivided
that
there
remains
very
little
education
for
the
worker
is
conquering
this
difficult
industrial
situation
by
equipping
each
apprentice
with
the
informing
mind
if
a
child
goes
into
a
sewing
factory
with
a
knowledge
of
the
work
she
is
doing
in
relation
to
the
finished
product
if
she
is
informed
concerning
the
material
she
is
manipulating
and
the
processes
to
which
it
is
subjected
if
she
understands
the
design
she
is
elaborating
in
its
historic
relation
to
art
and
decoration
her
daily
life
is
lifted
from
drudgery
to
one
of
activity
and
her
pleasure
and
intelligence
is
registered
in
her
product
i
remember
a
little
colored
girl
in
this
new
york
school
who
was
drawing
for
the
pattern
she
was
about
to
embroider
a
carefully
elaborated
acanthus
leaf
upon
my
inquiry
as
to
the
design
she
replied
it
is
what
the
egyptians
used
to
put
on
everything
because
they
saw
it
so
much
growing
in
the
nile
and
then
the
greeks
copied
it
and
sometimes
you
can
find
it
now
on
the
buildings
downtown
she
added
shyly
of
course
i
like
it
awfully
well
because
it
was
first
used
by
people
living
in
africa
where
the
colored
folks
come
from
such
a
reasonable
interest
in
work
not
only
reacts
upon
the
worker
but
is
of
course
registered
in
the
product
itself
such
genuine
pleasure
is
in
pitiful
contrast
to
the
usual
manifestation
of
the
play
spirit
as
it
is
found
in
the
factories
where
at
the
best
its
expression
is
illicit
and
often
is
attended
with
great
danger
there
are
many
touching
stories
by
which
this
might
be
illustrated
one
of
them
comes
from
a
large
steel
mill
of
a
boy
of
fifteen
whose
business
it
was
to
throw
a
lever
when
a
small
tank
became
filled
with
molton
metal
during
the
few
moments
when
the
tank
was
filling
it
was
his
foolish
custom
to
catch
the
reflection
of
the
metal
upon
a
piece
of
and
to
throw
the
bit
of
light
into
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
workmen
although
an
exasperated
foreman
had
twice
dispossessed
him
of
his
mirror
with
a
third
fragment
he
was
one
day
flicking
the
gloom
of
the
shop
when
the
neglected
tank
overflowed
almost
instantly
burning
off
both
his
legs
boys
working
in
the
stock
yards
during
their
moments
of
wrestling
and
rough
play
often
slash
each
other
painfully
with
the
short
knives
which
they
use
in
their
work
but
in
spite
of
this
the
play
impulse
is
too
irrepressible
to
be
denied
if
educators
could
go
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
into
that
army
of
boys
and
girls
who
enter
industry
each
year
what
values
might
they
not
discover
what
treasures
might
they
not
conserve
and
develop
if
they
would
direct
the
play
instinct
into
the
art
impulse
and
utilize
that
power
of
variation
which
industry
so
sadly
needs
no
force
will
be
sufficiently
powerful
and
widespread
to
redeem
industry
from
its
mechanism
and
materialism
save
the
freed
power
in
every
single
individual
in
order
to
do
this
however
we
must
go
back
a
little
over
the
educational
road
to
a
training
of
the
child
imagination
as
well
as
to
his
careful
equipment
with
a
technique
a
little
child
makes
a
very
tottering
house
of
cardboard
and
calls
it
a
castle
the
important
feature
there
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
has
expressed
a
castle
and
it
is
not
for
his
teacher
to
draw
undue
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
corners
are
not
well
put
together
but
rather
to
listen
to
and
to
direct
the
story
which
centers
about
this
effort
at
creative
expression
a
little
later
however
it
is
clearly
the
business
of
the
teacher
to
call
attention
to
the
quality
of
the
dovetailing
in
which
the
boy
at
the
manual
training
bench
is
engaged
for
there
is
no
value
in
dovetailing
a
box
unless
it
is
accurately
done
at
one
point
the
child
imagination
is
to
be
emphasized
and
at
another
point
his
technique
is
important
and
he
will
need
both
in
the
industrial
life
ahead
of
him
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
third
period
when
the
boy
is
not
interested
in
the
making
of
a
castle
or
a
box
or
anything
else
unless
it
appears
to
him
to
bear
a
direct
relation
to
the
future
unless
it
has
something
to
do
with
earning
a
living
at
this
later
moment
he
is
chiefly
anxious
to
play
the
part
of
a
man
and
to
take
his
place
in
the
world
the
fact
that
a
boy
at
fourteen
wants
to
go
out
and
earn
his
living
makes
that
the
moment
when
he
should
be
educated
with
reference
to
that
interest
and
the
records
of
many
high
schools
show
that
if
he
is
not
thus
educated
he
bluntly
refuses
to
be
educated
at
all
the
forces
pulling
him
to
work
are
not
only
the
overmastering
desire
to
earn
money
and
be
a
man
but
if
the
family
purse
is
small
and
empty
include
also
his
family
loyalty
and
affection
and
over
against
them
we
at
present
place
nothing
but
a
vague
belief
on
the
part
of
his
family
and
himself
that
education
is
a
desirable
thing
and
may
eventually
help
him
on
in
the
world
it
is
of
course
difficult
to
adapt
education
to
this
need
it
means
that
education
must
be
planned
so
seriously
and
definitely
for
those
two
years
between
fourteen
and
sixteen
that
it
will
be
actual
trade
training
so
far
as
it
goes
with
attention
given
to
the
condition
under
which
money
will
be
actually
paid
for
industrial
skill
but
at
the
same
time
that
the
implications
the
connections
the
relations
to
the
industrial
world
will
be
made
clear
a
man
who
makes
year
after
year
but
one
small
wheel
in
a
modern
watch
factory
may
if
his
education
has
properly
prepared
him
have
a
fuller
life
than
did
the
old
watchmaker
who
made
a
watch
from
beginning
to
end
it
takes
people
to
make
a
coat
in
a
modern
tailoring
establishment
yet
those
same
people
might
produce
a
coat
in
a
spirit
of
team
work
which
would
make
the
entire
process
as
much
more
exhilarating
than
the
work
of
the
old
solitary
tailor
as
playing
in
a
baseball
nine
gives
more
pleasure
to
a
boy
than
that
afforded
by
a
solitary
game
of
hand
ball
on
the
side
of
the
barn
but
it
is
quite
impossible
to
imagine
a
successful
game
of
baseball
in
which
each
player
should
be
drilled
only
in
his
own
part
and
should
know
nothing
of
the
relation
of
that
part
to
the
whole
game
in
order
to
make
the
watch
wheel
or
the
coat
collar
interesting
they
must
be
connected
with
the
entire
product
must
include
fellowship
as
well
as
the
pleasures
arising
from
skilled
workmanship
and
a
cultivated
imagination
when
all
the
young
people
working
in
factories
shall
come
to
use
their
faculties
intelligently
and
as
a
matter
of
course
to
be
interested
in
what
they
do
then
our
manufactured
products
may
at
last
meet
the
demands
of
a
cultivated
nation
because
they
will
be
produced
by
cultivated
workmen
the
machine
will
not
be
abandoned
by
any
means
but
will
be
subordinated
to
the
intelligence
of
the
man
who
manipulates
it
and
will
be
used
as
a
tool
it
may
come
about
in
time
that
an
educated
public
will
become
inexpressibly
bored
by
manufactured
objects
which
reflect
absolutely
nothing
of
the
minds
of
the
men
who
made
them
that
they
may
come
to
dislike
an
object
made
by
twelve
unrelated
men
even
as
we
do
not
care
for
a
picture
which
has
been
painted
by
a
dozen
different
men
not
because
we
have
enunciated
a
theory
in
regard
to
it
but
because
such
a
picture
loses
all
its
significance
and
has
no
meaning
or
message
we
need
to
apply
the
same
principle
but
very
little
further
until
we
shall
refuse
to
be
surrounded
by
manufactured
objects
which
do
not
represent
some
gleam
of
intelligence
on
the
part
of
the
producer
hundreds
of
people
have
already
taken
that
step
so
far
as
all
decoration
and
ornament
are
concerned
and
it
would
require
but
one
short
step
more
in
the
meantime
we
are
surrounded
by
stupid
articles
which
give
us
no
pleasure
and
the
young
people
producing
them
are
driven
into
all
sorts
of
expedients
in
order
to
escape
work
which
has
been
made
impossible
because
all
human
interest
has
been
extracted
from
it
that
this
is
not
mere
theory
may
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
many
times
the
young
people
may
be
spared
the
disastrous
effects
of
this
third
revolt
against
the
monotony
of
industry
if
work
can
be
found
for
them
in
a
place
where
the
daily
round
is
less
grinding
and
presents
more
variety
fortunately
in
every
city
there
are
places
outside
of
factories
where
occupation
of
a
more
normal
type
of
labor
may
be
secured
and
often
a
restless
boy
can
be
tided
over
this
period
if
he
is
put
into
one
of
these
occupations
the
experience
in
every
club
can
furnish
illustrations
of
this
a
factory
boy
who
had
been
brought
into
the
juvenile
court
many
times
because
of
his
persistent
habit
of
borrowing
the
vehicles
of
physicians
as
they
stood
in
front
of
houses
of
patients
always
meaning
to
get
back
before
the
doctor
came
out
led
a
contented
and
orderly
life
after
a
place
had
been
found
for
him
as
a
stable
boy
in
a
large
livery
establishment
where
his
love
for
horses
could
be
legitimately
gratified
still
another
boy
made
the
readjustment
for
himself
in
spite
of
the
great
physical
suffering
involved
he
had
lost
both
legs
at
the
age
of
seven
flipping
cars
when
he
went
to
work
at
fourteen
with
two
good
cork
legs
which
he
vainly
imagined
disguised
his
disability
his
employer
kindly
placed
him
where
he
might
sit
throughout
the
entire
day
and
his
task
was
to
keep
tally
on
the
boxes
constantly
hoisted
from
the
warehouse
into
cars
the
boy
found
this
work
so
dull
that
he
insisted
upon
working
in
the
yards
where
the
cars
were
being
loaded
and
switched
he
would
come
home
at
night
utterly
exhausted
more
from
the
extreme
nervous
tension
involved
in
avoiding
accidents
than
from
the
tremendous
exertion
and
although
he
would
weep
bitterly
from
sheer
fatigue
nothing
could
induce
him
to
go
back
to
the
duller
and
safer
job
fortunately
he
belonged
to
a
less
passionate
race
than
the
poor
little
italian
girl
in
the
neighborhood
who
recently
battered
her
head
against
the
wall
so
long
and
so
vigorously
that
she
had
to
be
taken
to
a
hospital
because
of
her
serious
injuries
so
nearly
as
dull
could
understand
it
had
been
an
hysterical
revolt
against
factory
work
by
day
and
no
fun
in
the
evening
america
perhaps
more
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
can
demonstrate
what
applied
science
has
accomplished
for
industry
it
has
not
only
made
possible
the
utilization
of
all
sorts
of
unpromising
raw
material
but
it
has
tremendously
increased
the
invention
and
elaboration
of
machinery
the
time
must
come
however
if
indeed
the
moment
has
not
already
arrived
when
applied
science
will
have
done
all
that
it
can
do
for
the
development
of
machinery
it
may
be
that
machines
can
not
be
speeded
up
any
further
without
putting
unwarranted
strain
upon
the
nervous
system
of
the
worker
it
may
be
that
further
elaboration
will
so
sacrifice
the
workman
who
feeds
the
machine
that
industrial
advance
will
lie
not
in
the
direction
of
improvement
in
machinery
but
in
the
recovery
and
education
of
the
workman
this
refusal
to
apply
the
art
of
life
to
industry
continually
drives
out
of
it
many
promising
young
people
some
of
them
impelled
by
a
creative
impulse
which
will
not
be
denied
avoid
industry
altogether
and
demand
that
their
ambitious
parents
give
them
lessons
in
china
painting
and
art
work
which
clutters
the
overcrowded
parlor
of
the
more
prosperous
workingman
home
with
useless
decorated
plates
and
handpainted
drapes
whereas
the
plates
upon
the
table
and
the
rugs
upon
the
floor
used
daily
by
thousands
of
weary
housewives
are
totally
untouched
by
the
beauty
and
variety
which
this
art
instinct
might
have
given
them
had
it
been
incorporated
into
industry
i
could
cite
many
instances
of
young
people
who
suffer
a
veritable
martyrdom
in
order
to
satisfy
their
artistic
impulse
a
young
girl
of
fourteen
whose
family
had
for
years
displayed
a
certain
artistic
aptitude
the
mother
having
been
a
singer
and
the
grandmother
with
whom
the
young
girl
lived
a
clever
worker
in
artificial
flowers
had
her
first
experience
of
wage
earning
in
a
box
factory
she
endured
it
only
for
three
months
and
then
gave
up
her
increasing
wage
in
exchange
for
a
week
which
she
earns
by
making
sketches
of
dresses
cloaks
and
hats
for
the
advertisements
of
a
large
department
store
a
young
russian
girl
of
my
acquaintance
starves
on
the
irregular
pay
which
she
receives
for
her
occasional
contributions
to
the
sunday
newspapers
meanwhile
writing
her
novel
rather
than
return
to
the
comparatively
prosperous
wages
of
a
necktie
factory
which
she
regards
with
horror
another
girl
washes
dishes
every
evening
in
a
cheap
boarding
house
in
order
to
secure
the
leisure
in
which
to
practise
her
singing
lessons
rather
than
to
give
them
up
and
return
to
her
former
job
in
an
electrical
factory
the
artistic
expression
in
all
these
cases
is
crude
but
the
young
people
are
still
conscious
of
that
old
sacrifice
of
material
interest
which
art
has
ever
demanded
of
those
who
serve
her
and
which
doubtless
brings
its
own
reward
that
the
sacrifice
is
in
vain
makes
it
all
the
more
touching
and
is
an
indictment
of
the
educator
who
has
failed
to
utilize
the
art
instinct
in
industry
something
of
the
same
sort
takes
place
among
many
lads
who
find
little
opportunity
in
the
ordinary
factories
to
utilize
the
instinct
for
workmanship
or
among
those
more
prosperous
young
people
who
establish
studios
and
art
shops
in
which
with
a
vast
expenditure
of
energy
they
manufacture
luxurious
articles
the
educational
system
in
germany
is
deliberately
planned
to
sift
out
and
to
retain
in
the
service
of
industry
all
such
promising
young
people
the
method
is
as
yet
experimental
and
open
to
many
objections
but
it
is
so
far
successful
that
made
in
germany
means
made
by
a
trained
artisan
and
in
many
cases
by
a
man
working
with
the
freed
impulse
of
the
artist
the
london
county
council
is
constantly
urging
plans
which
may
secure
for
the
gifted
children
in
the
board
schools
support
in
technological
institutes
educators
are
thus
gradually
developing
the
courage
and
initiative
to
conserve
for
industry
the
young
worker
himself
so
that
his
mind
his
power
of
variation
his
art
instinct
his
intelligent
skill
may
ultimately
be
reflected
in
the
industrial
product
that
would
imply
that
industry
must
be
seized
upon
and
conquered
by
those
educators
who
now
either
avoid
it
altogether
by
taking
refuge
in
the
caves
of
classic
learning
or
beg
the
question
by
teaching
the
tool
industry
advocated
by
ruskin
and
morris
in
their
first
reaction
against
the
present
industrial
system
it
would
mean
that
educators
must
bring
industry
into
the
kingdom
of
the
mind
and
pervade
it
with
the
human
spirit
the
discovery
of
the
labor
power
of
youth
was
to
our
age
like
the
discovery
of
a
new
natural
resource
although
it
was
merely
incidental
to
the
invention
of
modern
machinery
and
the
consequent
subdivision
of
labor
in
utilizing
it
thus
ruthlessly
we
are
not
only
in
danger
of
quenching
the
divine
fire
of
youth
but
we
are
imperiling
industry
itself
when
we
venture
to
ignore
these
very
sources
of
beauty
of
variety
and
of
suggestion
chapter
vi
the
thirst
for
righteousness
even
as
we
pass
by
the
joy
and
beauty
of
youth
on
the
streets
without
dreaming
it
is
there
so
we
may
hurry
past
the
very
presence
of
august
things
without
recognition
we
may
easily
fail
to
sense
those
spiritual
realities
which
in
every
age
have
haunted
youth
and
called
to
him
without
ceasing
historians
tell
us
that
the
extraordinary
advances
in
human
progress
have
been
made
in
those
times
when
the
ideals
of
freedom
and
law
of
youth
and
beauty
of
knowledge
and
virtue
of
humanity
and
religion
high
things
the
conflicts
between
which
have
caused
most
of
the
disruptions
and
despondences
of
human
society
seem
for
a
generation
or
two
to
lie
in
the
same
direction
are
we
perhaps
at
least
twice
in
life
journey
dimly
conscious
of
the
needlessness
of
this
disruption
and
of
the
futility
of
the
despondency
do
we
feel
it
first
when
young
ourselves
we
long
to
interrogate
the
transfigured
few
among
our
elders
whom
we
believe
to
be
carrying
forward
affairs
of
gravest
import
failing
to
accomplish
this
are
we
for
the
second
time
dogged
by
a
sense
of
lost
opportunity
of
needless
waste
and
perplexity
when
we
too
as
adults
see
again
the
dreams
of
youth
in
conflict
with
the
efforts
of
our
own
contemporaries
we
see
idealistic
endeavor
on
the
one
hand
lost
in
ugly
friction
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
borne
by
mature
men
and
women
on
the
other
hand
increased
by
their
consciousness
of
misunderstanding
and
high
scorn
it
may
relieve
the
mind
to
break
forth
in
moments
of
irritation
against
the
folly
of
the
coming
generation
but
whoso
pauses
on
his
plodding
way
to
call
even
his
youngest
and
rashest
brother
a
fool
ruins
thereby
the
joy
of
his
journey
for
youth
is
so
vivid
an
element
in
life
that
unless
it
is
cherished
all
the
rest
is
spoiled
the
most
praiseworthy
journey
grows
dull
and
leaden
unless
companioned
by
youth
iridescent
dreams
not
only
that
but
the
mature
of
each
generation
run
a
grave
risk
of
putting
their
efforts
in
a
futile
direction
in
a
blind
alley
as
it
were
unless
they
can
keep
in
touch
with
the
youth
of
their
own
day
and
know
at
least
the
trend
in
which
eager
dreams
are
driving
them
those
dreams
that
fairly
buffet
our
faces
as
we
walk
the
city
streets
at
times
every
one
possessed
with
a
concern
for
social
progress
is
discouraged
by
the
formless
and
unsubdued
modern
city
as
he
looks
upon
that
complicated
life
which
drives
men
almost
without
their
own
volition
that
life
of
ingenuous
enterprises
great
ambitions
political
jealousies
where
men
tend
to
become
mere
slaves
of
possessions
doubtless
these
striving
men
are
full
of
weakness
and
sensitiveness
even
when
they
rend
each
other
and
are
but
caught
in
the
coils
of
circumstance
nevertheless
a
serious
attempt
to
ennoble
and
enrich
the
content
of
city
life
that
it
may
really
fill
the
ample
space
their
ruthless
wills
have
provided
means
that
we
must
call
upon
energies
other
than
theirs
when
we
count
over
the
resources
which
are
at
work
to
make
order
out
of
casualty
beauty
out
of
confusion
justice
kindliness
and
mercy
out
of
cruelty
and
inconsiderate
pressure
we
find
ourselves
appealing
to
the
confident
spirit
of
youth
we
know
that
it
is
crude
and
filled
with
conflicting
hopes
some
of
them
unworthy
and
most
of
them
doomed
to
disappointment
yet
these
young
people
have
the
advantage
of
morning
in
their
hearts
they
have
such
power
of
direct
action
such
ability
to
stand
free
from
fear
to
break
through
life
trammelings
that
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
become
convinced
that
they
to
the
disappointed
earth
shall
give
the
lives
we
meant
to
live
that
this
solace
comes
to
us
only
in
fugitive
moments
and
is
easily
misleading
may
be
urged
as
an
excuse
for
our
blindness
and
insensitiveness
to
the
august
moral
resources
which
the
youth
of
each
city
offers
to
those
who
are
in
the
midst
of
the
city
turmoil
a
further
excuse
is
afforded
in
the
fact
that
the
form
of
the
dreams
for
beauty
and
righteousness
change
with
each
generation
and
that
while
it
is
always
difficult
for
the
fathers
to
understand
the
sons
at
those
periods
when
the
demand
of
the
young
is
one
of
social
reconstruction
the
misunderstanding
easily
grows
into
bitterness
the
old
desire
to
achieve
to
improve
the
world
seizes
the
ardent
youth
with
a
stern
command
to
bring
about
juster
social
conditions
youth
divine
impatience
with
the
world
inheritance
of
wrong
and
injustice
makes
him
scornful
of
rose
water
for
the
plague
prescriptions
and
he
insists
upon
something
strenuous
and
vital
one
can
find
innumerable
illustrations
of
this
idealistic
impatience
with
existing
conditions
among
the
many
russian
subjects
found
in
the
foreign
quarters
of
every
american
city
the
idealism
of
these
young
people
might
be
utilized
to
a
modification
of
our
general
culture
and
point
of
view
somewhat
as
the
influence
of
the
young
germans
who
came
to
america
in
the
early
fifties
bringing
with
them
the
hopes
and
aspirations
embodied
in
the
revolutions
of
made
a
profound
impression
upon
the
social
and
political
institutions
of
america
long
before
they
emigrated
thousands
of
russian
young
people
had
been
caught
up
into
the
excitements
and
hopes
of
the
russian
revolution
in
finland
in
poland
in
the
russian
cities
in
the
university
towns
life
had
become
intensified
by
the
consciousness
of
the
suffering
and
starvation
of
millions
of
their
fellow
subjects
they
had
been
living
with
a
sense
of
discipline
and
of
preparation
for
a
coming
struggle
which
although
grave
in
import
was
vivid
and
adventurous
their
minds
had
been
seized
by
the
first
crude
forms
of
social
theory
and
they
had
cherished
a
vague
belief
that
they
were
the
direct
instruments
of
a
final
and
ideal
social
reconstruction
when
they
come
to
america
they
sadly
miss
this
sense
of
importance
and
participation
in
a
great
and
glorious
conflict
against
a
recognized
enemy
life
suddenly
grows
stale
and
unprofitable
the
very
spirit
of
tolerance
which
characterizes
american
cities
is
that
which
strikes
most
unbearably
upon
their
ardent
spirits
they
look
upon
the
indifference
all
about
them
with
an
amazement
which
rapidly
changes
to
irritation
some
of
them
in
a
short
time
lose
their
ardor
others
with
incredible
rapidity
make
the
adaptation
between
american
conditions
and
their
store
of
enthusiasm
but
hundreds
of
them
remain
restless
and
ill
at
ease
their
only
consolation
almost
their
only
real
companionship
is
when
they
meet
in
small
groups
for
discussion
or
in
larger
groups
to
welcome
a
well
known
revolutionist
who
brings
them
direct
news
from
the
conflict
or
when
they
arrange
for
a
demonstration
in
memory
of
the
red
sunday
or
the
death
of
gershuni
such
demonstrations
however
are
held
in
honor
of
men
whose
sense
of
justice
was
obliged
to
seek
an
expression
quite
outside
the
regular
channels
of
established
government
knowing
that
russia
has
forced
thousands
of
her
subjects
into
this
position
one
would
imagine
that
patriotic
teachers
in
america
would
be
most
desirous
to
turn
into
governmental
channels
all
that
insatiable
desire
for
juster
relations
in
industrial
and
political
affairs
a
distinct
and
well
directed
campaign
is
necessary
if
this
gallant
enthusiasm
is
ever
to
be
made
part
of
that
old
and
still
incomplete
effort
to
embody
in
law
the
law
that
abides
and
falters
not
ages
long
the
highest
aspirations
for
justice
unfortunately
we
do
little
or
nothing
with
this
splendid
store
of
youthful
ardor
and
creative
enthusiasm
through
its
very
isolation
it
tends
to
intensify
and
turn
in
upon
itself
and
no
direct
effort
is
made
to
moralize
it
to
discipline
it
to
make
it
operative
upon
the
life
of
the
city
and
yet
it
is
perhaps
what
american
cities
need
above
all
else
for
it
is
but
too
true
that
democracy
a
people
ruling
the
very
name
of
which
the
greeks
considered
so
beautiful
no
longer
stirs
the
blood
of
the
american
youth
and
that
the
real
enthusiasm
for
must
be
found
among
the
groups
of
young
immigrants
who
bring
over
with
every
ship
a
new
cargo
of
democratic
aspirations
that
many
of
these
young
men
look
for
a
consummation
of
these
aspirations
to
a
social
order
of
the
future
in
which
the
industrial
system
as
well
as
government
shall
embody
democratic
relations
simply
shows
that
the
doctrine
of
democracy
like
any
other
of
the
living
faiths
of
men
is
so
essentially
mystical
that
it
continually
demands
new
formulation
to
fail
to
recognize
it
in
a
new
form
to
call
it
hard
names
to
refuse
to
receive
it
may
mean
to
reject
that
which
our
fathers
cherished
and
handed
on
as
an
inheritance
not
only
to
be
preserved
but
also
to
be
developed
we
allow
a
great
deal
of
this
precious
stuff
this
of
which
each
generation
has
need
not
only
to
go
unutilized
but
to
work
havoc
among
the
young
people
themselves
one
of
the
saddest
illustrations
of
this
in
my
personal
knowledge
was
that
of
a
young
russian
girl
who
lived
with
a
group
of
her
compatriots
on
the
west
side
of
chicago
she
recently
committed
suicide
at
the
same
time
that
several
others
in
the
group
tried
it
and
failed
one
of
these
latter
who
afterwards
talked
freely
of
the
motives
which
led
her
to
this
act
said
that
there
were
no
great
issues
at
stake
in
this
country
that
america
was
wholly
commercial
in
its
interests
and
absorbed
in
money
making
that
americans
were
not
held
together
by
any
historic
bonds
nor
great
mutual
hopes
and
were
totally
ignorant
of
the
stirring
social
and
philosophic
movements
of
europe
that
her
life
here
had
been
a
long
dreary
economic
struggle
unrelieved
by
any
of
the
higher
interests
that
she
was
tired
of
getting
cents
for
trimming
a
hat
that
sold
for
twelve
dollars
and
was
to
be
put
upon
the
empty
head
of
some
one
who
had
no
concern
for
the
welfare
of
the
woman
who
made
it
the
statement
doubtless
reflected
something
of
the
sorrows
of
werther
but
the
entire
tone
was
nobler
and
more
highly
socialized
it
is
difficult
to
illustrate
what
might
be
accomplished
by
reducing
to
action
the
ardor
of
those
youths
who
so
bitterly
arraign
our
present
industrial
order
while
no
part
of
the
social
system
can
be
changed
rapidly
we
would
all
admit
that
the
present
industrial
arrangements
in
america
might
be
vastly
improved
and
that
we
are
failing
to
meet
the
requirements
of
our
industrial
life
with
courage
and
success
simply
because
we
do
not
realize
that
unless
we
establish
that
humane
legislation
which
has
its
roots
in
a
consideration
for
human
life
our
industrialism
itself
will
suffer
from
inbreeding
growing
ever
more
unrestrained
and
ruthless
it
would
seem
obvious
that
in
order
to
secure
relief
in
a
community
dominated
by
industrial
ideals
an
appeal
must
be
made
to
the
old
spiritual
sanctions
for
human
conduct
that
we
must
reach
motives
more
substantial
and
enduring
than
the
mere
fleeting
experiences
of
one
phase
of
modern
industry
which
vainly
imagines
that
its
growth
would
be
curtailed
if
the
welfare
of
its
employees
were
guarded
by
the
state
it
would
be
an
interesting
attempt
to
turn
that
youthful
enthusiasm
to
the
aid
of
one
of
the
most
conservative
of
the
present
social
efforts
the
almost
movement
to
secure
protective
legislation
for
women
and
children
in
industry
in
which
america
is
so
behind
the
other
nations
fourteen
of
the
great
european
powers
protect
women
from
all
night
work
from
excessive
labor
by
day
because
paternalistic
governments
prize
the
strength
of
women
for
the
bearing
and
rearing
of
healthy
children
to
the
state
and
yet
in
a
republic
it
is
the
citizens
themselves
who
must
be
convinced
of
the
need
of
this
protection
unless
they
would
permit
industry
to
maim
the
very
mothers
of
the
future
in
one
year
in
the
german
empire
one
hundred
thousand
children
were
cared
for
through
money
paid
from
the
state
insurance
fund
to
their
widowed
mothers
or
to
their
invalided
fathers
and
yet
in
the
american
states
it
seems
impossible
to
pass
a
most
rudimentary
liability
act
which
would
be
but
the
first
step
towards
that
code
of
beneficent
legislation
which
protects
the
widow
and
fatherless
in
germany
and
england
certainly
we
shall
have
to
bestir
ourselves
if
we
would
care
for
the
victims
of
the
industrial
order
as
well
as
do
other
nations
we
shall
be
obliged
speedily
to
realize
that
in
order
to
secure
protective
legislation
from
a
governmental
body
in
which
the
most
powerful
interests
represented
are
those
of
the
producers
and
transporters
of
manufactured
goods
it
will
be
necessary
to
exhort
to
a
care
for
the
defenseless
from
the
religious
point
of
view
to
take
even
the
point
of
view
would
be
to
assert
that
evolutionary
progress
assumes
that
a
sound
physique
is
the
only
secure
basis
of
life
and
to
guard
the
mothers
of
the
race
is
simple
sanity
and
yet
from
lack
of
preaching
we
do
not
unite
for
action
because
we
are
not
stirred
to
act
at
all
and
protective
legislation
in
america
is
shamefully
inadequate
because
it
is
always
difficult
to
put
the
championship
of
the
oppressed
above
the
counsels
of
prudence
we
say
in
despair
sometimes
that
we
are
a
people
who
hold
such
varied
creeds
that
there
are
not
enough
of
one
religious
faith
to
secure
anything
but
the
truth
is
that
it
is
easy
to
unite
for
action
people
whose
hearts
have
once
been
filled
by
the
fervor
of
that
willing
devotion
which
may
easily
be
generated
in
the
youthful
breast
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
enlarge
a
moral
concept
but
extremely
difficult
to
give
it
to
an
adult
for
the
first
time
and
yet
when
we
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
old
sanctions
for
disinterested
conduct
the
conclusion
is
often
forced
upon
us
that
they
have
not
been
engrained
into
character
that
they
can
not
be
relied
upon
when
they
are
brought
into
contact
with
the
arguments
of
industrialism
that
the
colors
of
the
flag
flying
over
the
fort
of
our
spiritual
resources
wash
out
and
disappear
when
the
storm
actually
breaks
it
is
because
the
ardor
of
youth
has
not
been
attracted
to
the
long
effort
to
modify
the
ruthlessness
of
industry
by
humane
enactments
that
we
sadly
miss
their
resourceful
enthusiasm
and
that
at
the
same
time
groups
of
young
people
who
hunger
and
thirst
after
social
righteousness
are
breaking
their
hearts
because
the
social
reform
is
so
long
delayed
and
an
unsympathetic
and
hardhearted
society
frustrates
all
their
hopes
and
yet
these
ardent
young
people
who
obscure
the
issue
by
their
crying
and
striving
and
looking
in
the
wrong
place
might
be
of
inestimable
value
if
political
leaders
were
in
any
sense
social
philosophers
to
permit
these
young
people
to
separate
themselves
from
the
contemporaneous
efforts
of
ameliorating
society
and
to
turn
their
vague
hopes
solely
toward
an
ideal
commonwealth
of
the
future
is
to
withdraw
from
an
experimental
founded
in
enthusiasm
the
very
stores
of
enthusiasm
which
are
needed
to
sustain
it
the
championship
of
the
oppressed
came
to
be
a
spiritual
passion
with
the
hebrew
prophets
they
saw
the
promises
of
religion
not
for
individuals
but
in
the
broad
reaches
of
national
affairs
and
in
the
establishment
of
social
justice
it
is
quite
possible
that
such
a
spiritual
passion
is
again
to
be
found
among
the
ardent
young
souls
of
our
cities
they
see
a
vision
not
of
a
purified
nation
but
of
a
regenerated
and
a
reorganized
society
shall
we
throw
all
this
into
the
future
into
the
futile
prophecy
of
those
who
talk
because
they
can
not
achieve
or
shall
we
commingle
their
ardor
their
overmastering
desire
for
social
justice
with
that
more
sober
effort
to
modify
existing
conditions
are
we
once
more
forced
to
appeal
to
the
educators
is
it
so
difficult
to
utilize
this
ardor
because
educators
have
failed
to
apprehend
the
spiritual
quality
of
their
task
it
would
seem
a
golden
opportunity
for
those
to
whom
is
committed
the
task
of
spiritual
instruction
for
to
preach
and
seek
justice
in
human
affairs
is
one
of
the
oldest
obligations
of
religion
and
morality
all
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
to
attach
this
teaching
to
the
contemporary
world
in
such
wise
that
the
eager
youth
might
feel
a
tug
upon
his
faculties
and
a
sense
of
participation
in
the
moral
life
about
him
to
leave
it
unattached
to
actual
social
movements
means
that
the
moralist
is
speaking
in
incomprehensible
terms
without
this
connection
the
religious
teachers
may
have
conscientiously
carried
out
their
traditional
duties
and
yet
have
failed
utterly
to
stir
the
fires
of
spiritual
enthusiasm
each
generation
of
moralists
and
educators
find
themselves
facing
an
inevitable
dilemma
first
to
keep
the
young
committed
to
their
charge
unspotted
from
the
world
and
second
to
connect
the
young
with
the
ruthless
and
materialistic
world
all
about
them
in
such
wise
that
they
may
make
it
the
arena
for
their
spiritual
endeavor
it
is
fortunate
for
these
teachers
that
sometime
during
the
golden
age
the
most
prosaic
youth
is
seized
by
a
new
interest
in
remote
and
universal
ends
and
that
if
but
given
a
clue
by
which
he
may
connect
his
lofty
aims
with
his
daily
living
he
himself
will
drag
the
very
heavens
into
the
most
sordid
tenement
the
perpetual
difficulty
consists
in
finding
the
clue
for
him
and
placing
it
in
his
hands
for
if
the
teaching
is
too
detached
from
life
it
does
not
result
in
any
psychic
impulsion
at
all
i
remember
as
an
illustration
of
the
saving
power
of
this
definite
connection
a
tale
told
me
by
a
distinguished
labor
leader
in
england
his
affections
had
been
starved
even
as
a
child
for
he
knew
nothing
of
his
parents
his
earliest
memories
being
associated
with
a
wretched
old
woman
who
took
the
most
casual
care
of
him
when
he
was
nine
years
old
he
ran
away
to
sea
and
for
the
next
seven
years
led
the
rough
life
of
a
dock
laborer
until
he
became
much
interested
in
a
little
crippled
boy
who
by
the
death
of
his
father
had
been
left
solitary
on
a
freight
boat
my
english
friend
promptly
adopted
the
child
as
his
own
and
all
the
questionings
of
life
centered
about
his
young
prot√©g√©
he
was
constantly
driven
to
attend
evening
meetings
where
he
heard
discussed
those
social
conditions
which
bear
so
hard
upon
the
weak
and
sick
the
crippled
boy
lived
until
he
was
fifteen
and
by
that
time
the
regeneration
of
his
foster
father
was
complete
the
young
docker
was
committed
for
life
to
the
bettering
of
social
conditions
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
abstract
moral
appeal
could
have
reached
such
a
roving
nature
certainly
no
attempt
to
incite
his
ambition
would
have
succeeded
only
a
pull
upon
his
deepest
sympathies
and
affections
his
desire
to
protect
and
cherish
a
weaker
thing
could
possibly
have
stimulated
him
and
connected
him
with
the
forces
making
for
moral
and
social
progress
this
of
course
has
ever
been
the
task
of
religion
to
make
the
sense
of
obligation
personal
to
touch
morality
with
enthusiasm
to
bathe
the
world
in
affection
and
on
all
sides
we
are
challenging
the
teachers
of
religion
to
perform
this
task
for
the
youth
of
the
city
for
thousands
of
years
definite
religious
instruction
has
been
given
by
authorized
agents
to
the
youth
of
all
nations
emphasized
through
tribal
ceremonials
the
assumption
of
the
roman
toga
the
barmitzvah
of
the
jews
the
first
communion
of
thousands
of
children
in
catholic
europe
the
sunday
schools
of
even
the
least
formal
of
the
evangelical
sects
it
is
as
if
men
had
always
felt
that
this
expanding
period
of
human
life
must
be
seized
upon
for
spiritual
ends
that
the
tender
tissue
and
newly
awakened
emotions
must
be
made
the
repository
for
the
historic
ideals
and
dogmas
which
are
after
all
the
most
precious
possessions
of
the
race
how
has
it
come
about
that
so
many
of
the
city
youth
are
not
given
their
share
in
our
common
inheritance
of
life
best
goods
why
are
their
tender
feet
so
often
ensnared
even
when
they
are
going
about
youth
legitimate
business
one
would
suppose
that
in
such
an
age
as
ours
moral
teachers
would
be
put
upon
their
mettle
that
moral
authority
would
be
forced
to
speak
with
no
uncertain
sound
if
only
to
be
heard
above
the
din
of
machinery
and
the
roar
of
industrialism
that
it
would
have
exerted
itself
as
never
before
to
convince
the
youth
of
the
reality
of
the
spiritual
life
affrighted
as
the
moralists
must
be
by
the
sudden
new
emphasis
placed
upon
wealth
despairing
of
the
older
men
and
women
who
are
already
caught
by
its
rewards
one
would
say
that
they
would
have
seized
upon
the
multitude
of
young
people
whose
minds
are
busied
with
issues
which
lie
beyond
the
portals
of
life
as
the
only
resource
which
might
save
the
city
from
the
fate
of
those
who
perish
through
lack
of
vision
yet
because
this
inheritance
has
not
been
attached
to
conduct
the
youth
of
jewish
birth
may
have
been
taught
that
prophets
and
statesmen
for
three
thousand
years
declared
jehovah
to
be
a
god
of
justice
who
hated
oppression
and
desired
righteousness
but
there
is
no
real
appeal
to
his
spirit
of
moral
adventure
unless
he
is
told
that
the
most
stirring
attempts
to
translate
justice
into
the
modern
social
order
have
been
inaugurated
and
carried
forward
by
men
of
his
own
race
and
that
until
he
joins
in
the
contemporary
manifestations
of
that
attempt
he
is
recreant
to
his
highest
traditions
and
obligations
the
christian
youth
may
have
been
taught
that
man
heartbreaking
adventure
to
find
justice
in
the
order
of
the
universe
moved
the
god
of
heaven
himself
to
send
a
mediator
in
order
that
the
justice
man
craves
and
the
mercy
by
which
alone
he
can
endure
his
weakness
might
be
reconciled
but
he
will
not
make
the
doctrine
his
own
until
he
reduces
it
to
action
and
tries
to
translate
the
spirit
of
his
master
into
social
terms
the
youth
who
calls
himself
an
evolutionist
it
is
rather
hard
to
find
a
name
for
this
youth
but
there
are
thousands
of
him
and
a
fine
fellow
he
often
is
has
read
of
that
struggle
beginning
with
the
earliest
tribal
effort
to
establish
just
relations
between
man
and
man
but
he
still
needs
to
be
told
that
after
all
justice
can
only
be
worked
out
upon
this
earth
by
those
who
will
not
tolerate
a
wrong
to
the
feeblest
member
of
the
community
and
that
it
will
become
a
social
force
only
in
proportion
as
men
steadfastly
strive
to
establish
it
if
these
young
people
who
are
subjected
to
varied
religious
instruction
are
also
stirred
to
action
or
rather
if
the
instruction
is
given
validity
because
it
is
attached
to
conduct
then
it
may
be
comparatively
easy
to
bring
about
certain
social
reforms
so
sorely
needed
in
our
industrial
cities
we
are
at
times
obliged
to
admit
however
that
both
the
school
and
the
church
have
failed
to
perform
this
office
and
are
indicted
by
the
young
people
themselves
thousands
of
young
people
in
every
great
city
are
either
frankly
hedonistic
or
are
vainly
attempting
to
work
out
for
themselves
a
satisfactory
code
of
morals
they
cast
about
in
all
directions
for
the
clue
which
shall
connect
their
loftiest
hopes
with
their
actual
living
several
years
ago
a
committee
of
lads
came
to
see
me
in
order
to
complain
of
a
certain
high
school
principal
because
he
never
talks
to
us
about
life
when
urged
to
make
a
clearer
statement
they
added
he
never
asks
us
what
we
are
going
to
be
we
ca
get
a
word
out
of
him
excepting
lessons
and
keeping
quiet
in
the
halls
of
the
dozens
of
young
women
who
have
begged
me
to
make
a
connection
for
them
between
their
dreams
of
social
usefulness
and
their
actual
living
i
recall
one
of
the
many
whom
i
had
sent
back
to
her
clergyman
returning
with
this
remark
his
only
suggestion
was
that
i
should
be
responsible
every
sunday
for
fresh
flowers
upon
the
altar
i
did
that
when
i
was
fifteen
and
liked
it
then
but
when
you
have
come
back
from
college
and
are
years
old
it
does
quite
fit
in
with
the
vigorous
efforts
you
have
been
told
are
necessary
in
order
to
make
our
social
relations
more
christian
all
of
us
forget
how
very
early
we
are
in
the
experiment
of
founding
in
this
trying
climate
of
america
and
that
we
are
making
the
experiment
in
the
most
materialistic
period
of
all
history
having
as
our
court
of
last
appeal
against
that
materialism
only
the
wonderful
and
inexplicable
instinct
for
justice
which
resides
in
the
hearts
of
men
which
is
never
so
irresistible
as
when
the
heart
is
young
we
may
cultivate
this
most
precious
possession
or
we
may
disregard
it
we
may
listen
to
the
young
voices
rising
clear
above
the
roar
of
industrialism
and
the
prudent
councils
of
commerce
or
we
may
become
hypnotized
by
the
sudden
new
emphasis
placed
upon
wealth
and
power
and
forget
the
supremacy
of
spiritual
forces
in
affairs
it
is
as
if
we
ignored
a
wistful
creature
who
walked
through
our
city
streets
calling
out
i
am
the
spirit
of
youth
with
me
all
things
are
possible
we
fail
to
understand
what
he
wants
or
even
to
see
his
doings
although
his
acts
are
pregnant
with
meaning
and
we
may
either
translate
them
into
a
sordid
chronicle
of
petty
vice
or
turn
them
into
a
solemn
school
for
civic
righteousness
we
may
either
smother
the
divine
fire
of
youth
or
we
may
feed
it
we
may
either
stand
stupidly
staring
as
it
sinks
into
a
murky
fire
of
crime
and
flares
into
the
intermittent
blaze
of
folly
or
we
may
tend
it
into
a
lambent
flame
with
power
to
make
clean
and
bright
our
dingy
city
streets
printed
in
the
united
states
of
america
