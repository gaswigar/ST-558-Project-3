moon
well
anyway
i
ll
go

you
thyrsis
off
stage
sir
we
are
in
our
cothurnus
come
out
and
do
the
scene
corydon
off
stage
you
are
mocking
us
the
scene
is
down
for
later
cothurnus
that
is
true
but
we
will
play
it
now
i
am
the
scene
seats
himself
on
high
place
in
back
of
stage
enter
corydon
and
thyrsis
corydon
sir
we
are
counting
on
this
little
hour
we
said
here
is
an
hour
which
to
think
a
mighty
thought
and
sing
a
trifling
song
and
look
at
behold
the
hour
even
as
we
spoke
was
over
and
the
act
begun
under
our
feet
thyrsis
sir
we
are
not
in
the
fancy
to
play
the
play
we
had
thought
to
play
it
later
corydon
besides
this
is
the
setting
for
a
farce
our
scene
requires
a
wall
we
can
not
build
a
wall
of
thyrsis
we
can
not
act
a
tragedy
with
comic
properties
cothurnus
try
it
and
see
i
think
you
ll
find
you
can
one
wall
is
like
another
and
regarding
the
matter
of
your
insufficient
mood
the
important
thing
is
that
you
speak
the
lines
and
make
the
gestures
wherefore
i
shall
remain
throughout
and
hold
the
are
you
ready
sorrowfully
sir
we
are
always
ready
cothurnus
play
the
play
corydon
and
thyrsis
move
the
table
and
chairs
to
one
side
out
of
the
way
and
seat
themselves
in
a
position
on
the
floor
thyrsis
how
gently
in
the
silence
corydon
our
sheep
go
up
the
bank
they
crop
a
grass
that
s
yellow
where
the
sun
is
out
and
black
where
the
clouds
drag
their
shadows
have
you
noticed
how
steadily
yet
with
what
a
slanting
eye
they
graze
corydon
as
if
they
thought
of
other
things
what
say
you
thyrsis
do
they
only
question
where
next
to
pull
do
their
far
minds
draw
them
thus
vaguely
north
of
west
and
south
of
east
thyrsis
one
can
not
say
the
black
lamb
wears
its
burdocks
as
if
they
were
a
garland
you
noticed
purple
and
drinks
the
bitten
grass
as
if
it
were
a
wine
corydon
i
ve
noticed
that
what
say
you
thyrsis
shall
we
make
a
song
about
a
lamb
that
thought
himself
a
shepherd
thyrsis
why
yes
is
why
i
have
forgotten
my
line
cothurnus
prompting
i
know
a
game
worth
two
of
that
thyrsis
oh
yes
i
know
a
game
worth
two
of
that
let
s
gather
rocks
and
build
a
wall
between
us
and
say
that
over
there
belongs
to
me
and
over
here
to
you
corydon
why
well
and
say
you
may
not
come
upon
my
side
unless
i
say
you
may
thyrsis
nor
you
on
mine
and
if
you
should
twould
be
the
worse
for
you
they
weave
a
wall
of
colored
crêpe
paper
ribbons
from
the
centre
front
to
the
centre
back
of
the
stage
fastening
the
ends
to
columbine
s
chair
in
front
and
to
pierrot
s
chair
in
the
back
corydon
now
there
s
a
wall
a
man
may
see
across
but
not
attempt
to
scale
thyrsis
an
excellent
wall
corydon
come
let
us
separate
and
sit
alone
a
little
while
and
lay
a
plot
whereby
we
may
outdo
each
other
they
seat
themselves
on
opposite
sides
of
the
wall
pierrot
off
stage
ehè
pierrette
columbine
off
stage
my
name
is
columbine
leave
me
alone
thyrsis
coming
up
to
the
wall
corydon
after
all
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
i
started
it
myself
i
do
not
like
this
so
very
much
what
is
the
sense
of
saying
i
do
not
want
you
on
my
side
the
wall
it
is
a
silly
game
i
d
much
prefer
making
the
little
song
you
spoke
of
making
about
the
lamb
you
know
that
thought
himself
a
shepherd
do
you
say
pause
corydon
at
wall
i
have
forgotten
the
line
cothurnus
prompting
how
do
i
know
this
isn
t
a
trick
corydon
oh
yes
how
do
i
know
this
isn
t
a
trick
to
get
upon
my
land
thyrsis
oh
corydon
you
it
s
not
a
trick
i
do
not
like
the
game
that
s
all
come
over
here
or
let
me
come
over
there
corydon
it
is
a
clever
trick
to
get
upon
my
land
seats
himself
as
before
thyrsis
oh
very
well
seats
himself
as
before
to
himself
i
think
i
never
knew
a
sillier
game
corydon
coming
to
wall
oh
thyrsis
just
a
minute
the
water
is
on
your
side
the
wall
and
the
sheep
are
thirsty
i
hadn
t
thought
of
that
thyrsis
oh
hadn
t
you
corydon
why
what
do
you
mean
thyrsis
what
do
i
mean
mean
that
i
can
play
a
game
as
well
as
you
can
and
if
the
pool
is
on
my
side
it
s
on
my
side
that
s
all
corydon
you
mean
you
d
let
the
sheep
go
thirsty
thyrsis
well
they
re
not
my
sheep
my
sheep
have
water
enough
corydon
sheep
you
are
mad
to
call
them
are
all
one
flock
thyrsis
you
can
t
mean
to
keep
the
water
from
them
just
because
they
happened
to
be
grazing
over
here
instead
of
over
there
when
we
set
the
wall
up
thyrsis
oh
can
t
i
and
see
if
you
try
to
lead
them
over
here
you
ll
wish
you
hadn
t
corydon
i
wonder
how
it
happens
all
the
water
is
on
your
side
i
ll
say
you
had
an
eye
out
for
lots
of
little
things
my
innocent
friend
when
i
said
let
us
make
a
song
and
you
said
i
know
a
game
worth
two
of
that
columbine
off
stage
pierrot
d
you
know
i
think
you
must
be
getting
old
or
fat
or
something
anyway
can
t
you
put
on
some
other
kind
of
collar
thyrsis
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
corydon
i
never
thought
anything
of
the
kind
you
corydon
i
not
thyrsis
don
t
you
corydon
oh
i
suppose
so
thyrsis
let
s
drop
this
do
you
say
s
only
a
game
you
know
we
seem
to
be
forgetting
it
s
only
a
game
a
pretty
serious
game
it
s
getting
to
be
when
one
of
us
is
willing
to
let
the
sheep
go
thirsty
for
the
sake
of
it
thyrsis
i
know
it
corydon
they
reach
out
their
arms
to
each
other
across
the
wall
cothurnus
prompting
but
how
do
i
thyrsis
oh
yes
but
how
do
i
know
this
isn
t
a
trick
to
water
your
sheep
and
get
the
laugh
on
me
corydon
you
can
t
know
that
s
the
difficult
thing
about
it
of
course
can
t
be
sure
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
and
i
know
just
how
you
feel
but
one
of
us
has
to
take
a
risk
or
else
why
don
t
you
see
game
goes
on
forever
it
s
terrible
when
you
stop
to
think
of
it

the
first
time
i
feel
this
wall
is
actually
a
wall

ugly
game

other
side

licked
my
hair
i
saw
the
wool
about
its
neck
as
plain
as
anything

time
watching
a
flock
of
sheep
go
up
a
hill
when
i
have
these
to
play

i

whether
to

a
thousand
beautiful
girls
to
bathe
me
and
be
happy
until

die
or

a
purple
you
my
sheep
did
you
say
come
come
what
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
i
ve
a
lot
of
thinking
to
do
while
i
m
thinking
the
sheep
might
just
as
well
be
over
here
as
over
there
a
blue
a
red
thyrsis
but
they
will
die
corydon
and
a
green
a
couple
of
white
ones
for
a
change
thyrsis
maybe
i
have
some
jewels
on
my
side
corydon
and
another
green
maybe
but
i
don
t
think
so
you
see
this
rock
isn
t
so
very
wide
it
stops
before
it
gets
to
the
wall
it
seems
to
go
quite
deep
however
thyrsis
with
hatred
i
see
columbine
off
stage
look
pierrot
there
s
the
moon
pierrot
off
stage
nonsense
thyrsis
i
see
columbine
off
stage
sing
me
an
old
song
pierrot
something
i
can
remember
pierrot
off
stage
columbine
your
mind
is
made
of
crumbs
an
escallop
of
oysters
a
layer
of
crumbs
and
then
an
oystery
taste
and
then
a
layer
of
crumbs
thyrsis
searching
i
find
no
jewels
but
i
wonder
what
the
root
of
this
black
weed
would
do
to
a
man
if
he
should
taste
it
i
have
seen
a
sheep
die
with
half
the
stalk
still
drooling
from
its
mouth
twould
be
a
speedy
remedy
i
should
think
for
a
festered
pride
and
a
feverish
ambition
it
has
a
curious
root
i
think
i
ll
hack
it
in
little
pieces
first
i
ll
get
me
a
drink
and
then
i
ll
hack
that
root
in
little
pieces
as
small
as
dust
and
see
what
the
color
is
inside
goes
to
bowl
on
floor
the
pool
is
very
clear
i
see
a
shepherd
standing
on
the
brink
with
a
red
cloak
about
him
and
a
black
weed
in
his
hand
tis
i
kneels
and
drinks
corydon
coming
to
wall
hello
what
are
you
doing
thyrsis
thyrsis
digging
for
gold
corydon
i
ll
give
you
all
the
gold
you
want
if
you
ll
give
me
a
bowl
of
water
if
you
don
t
want
too
much
that
is
to
say
thyrsis
ho
so
you
ve
changed
your
mind
s
different
isn
t
it
when
you
want
a
drink
yourself
corydon
of
course
it
is
thyrsis
well
let
me
see
a
bowl
of
water
back
in
an
hour
corydon
i
m
busy
now
corydon
oh
thyrsis
give
me
a
bowl
of
water
i
ll
fill
the
bowl
with
jewels
and
bring
it
back
thyrsis
be
off
i
m
busy
now
he
catches
sight
of
the
weed
picks
it
up
and
looks
at
it
unseen
by
corydon
wait
me
out
the
finest
stones
you
have
i
ll
bring
you
a
drink
of
water
presently
corydon
goes
back
and
sits
down
with
the
jewels
before
him
a
bowl
of
jewels
is
a
lot
of
jewels
thyrsis
chopping
up
the
weed
i
wonder
if
it
has
a
bitter
taste
corydon
there
s
sure
to
be
a
stone
or
two
among
them
i
have
grown
fond
of
pouring
them
from
one
hand
into
the
other
thyrsis
i
hope
it
doesn
t
taste
too
bitter
just
at
first
corydon
a
bowl
of
jewels
is
far
too
many
jewels
to
give
away
and
not
get
back
again
thyrsis
i
don
t
believe
he
ll
notice
he
s
too
thirsty
he
ll
gulp
it
down
and
never
notice
corydon
there
ought
to
be
some
way
to
get
them
back
again
i
could
give
him
a
necklace
and
snatch
it
back
after
i
d
drunk
the
water
i
suppose
why
as
for
that
of
course
a
he
puts
two
or
three
of
the
colored
tapes
together
and
tries
their
strength
by
pulling
them
after
which
he
puts
them
around
his
neck
and
pulls
them
gently
nodding
to
himself
he
gets
up
and
goes
to
the
wall
with
the
colored
tapes
in
his
hands
thyrsis
in
the
meantime
has
poured
the
powdered
the
pot
which
contained
the
flower
and
filled
it
up
with
wine
from
the
on
the
floor
he
comes
to
the
wall
at
the
same
time
holding
the
bowl
of
poison
thyrsis
come
get
your
bowl
of
water
corydon
corydon
ah
very
good
for
such
a
gift
as
that
i
ll

you
more
than

you
three
long
necklaces

friend
come
closer
here

are
puts
the
ribbons

ve
drunk

then
hold
it
steady
for
every
drop

ll
have
a
stone

of
this
chain

very
silly
game
why

not

game
a
minute
more
let
s
make
a
little
song
about
a
lamb
i
m
coming
over
the
wall
no
matter
what
you
say
want
to
be
near
you
groping
his
way
with
arms
wide
before
him
he
strides
through
the
frail
papers
of
the
wall
without
knowing
it
and
continues
seeking
for
the
wall
straight
across
the
stage
where
is
the
wall
gropes
his
way
back
and
stands
very
near
thyrsis
without
seeing
him
he
speaks
slowly
there
isn
t
any
wall
i
think
takes
a
step
forward
his
foot
touches
thyrsis
body
and
he
falls
down
beside
him
thyrsis
where
is
your
cloak
give
me
a
little
bit
of
your
cloak
draws
corner
of
thyrsis
cloak
over
his
shoulders
falls
across
thyrsis
body
and
dies
cothurnus
closes
the
with
a
bang
arises
comes
down
stage
and
places
the
table
over
the
two
bodies
drawing
down
the
cover
so
that
they
are
hidden
from
any
actors
on
the
stage
but
visible
to
the
audience
pushing
in
their
feet
and
hands
with
his
boot
he
then
turns
his
back
to
the
audience
and
claps
his
hands
twice
cothurnus
strike
the
scene

cothurnus
enter
pierrot
and

don
t
puff
so
columbine
columbine
lord
what
a
mess
this
set
is
in
if
there
s
one
thing
i
hate
above
everything
else
more
than
getting
my
feet
it
s
clutter
might
at
least
have
left
the
scene
the
way
he
found
it
don
t
you
say
so
pierrot
she
picks
up
punch
bowl
they
arrange
chairs
as
before
at
ends
of

we
begin
columbine
screams
my
god
what
s
that
there
under

how
curious
to
strangle
him
like
that
with
colored
paper
ribbons
pierrot
yes
and
yet
i
dare
say
he
is
just
as
dead
pauses
calls
cothurnus
come
drag
these
bodies
out
of
here
we
can
t
sit
down
and
eat
with
two
dead
bodies
lying
under
the
table
the
audience
wouldn
t
stand
for
it
cothurnus
off
stage
what
makes
you
think
so
pull
down
the
tablecloth
on
the
other
side
and
hide
them
from
the
house
and
play
the
farce
the
audience
will
forget

so
give
me
a
hand
there
columbine
pierrot
and
columbine
pull
down
the
table
cover
in
such
a
way
that
the
two
bodies
are
hidden
from
the
house
then
merrily
set
their
bowls
back
on
the
table
draw
up
their
chairs
and

the
play

s
note
so
great
is
my
vexation
always
when
reading
a
play
to
find
its
progress
constantly
being
halted
and
its
structure
loosened
by
elaborate
explanatory
parentheses
that
i
resolved
when
i
should
publish
aria
da
capo
to
incorporate
into
its
text
only
those
explanations
the
omission
of
which
might
confuse
the
reader
or
lend
a
wrong
interpretation
to
the
lines
since
however
aria
da
capo
was
written
not
only
to
be
read
but
also
to
be
acted
and
being
conscious
that
the
exclusion
of
the
usual
directions
while
clarifying
the
play
to
the
reader
may
make
it
bare
of
suggestions
and
somewhat
baffling
to
the
producer
i
am
adding
here
some
remarks
which
have
been
found
of
value
in
preparing
it
for
presentation
on
the
stage
since
the
production
of
aria
da
capo
by
the
provincetown
players
i
have
received
a
great
many
letters
from
the
directors
of
little
theatres
asking
for
copies
of
it
with
a
view
to
producing
it
very
often
after
i
send
the
play
i
receive
a
letter
in
reply
asking
for
some
suggestions
for
its
presentation
and
enclosing
direct
questions
on
points
that
have
been
difficult
it
occurred
to
me
finally
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
make
up
a
sort
of
informal
to
send
about
with
the
play
and
it
is
that
which
is
printed
below
it
will
be
found
incomplete
and
uneven
in
some
instances
unnecessarily
detailed
in
others
not
sufficiently
so
all
of
which
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
put
together
loosely
from
answers
to
chance
questions
rather
than
logically
as
an
entity
in
itself
suggestions
for
the
production
of
aria
da
capo
setting
the
setting
required
is
simple
grey
curtain
a
long
black
table
two
slender
black
chairs
and
a
raised
platform
instead
of
wings
and
the
provincetown
players
cleverly
utilized
painted
screens
the
heights
varying
from
to
feet
these
being
set
right
and
left
of
the
stage
in
such
manner
as
to
give
the
effect
of
depth
and
distance
the
table
six
feet
long
and
two
feet
wide
has
thin
legs
and
is
painted
black
when
pierrot
and
columbine
enter
in
the
final
scene
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
table
which
cothurnus
has
replaced
shall
entirely
conceal
the
bodies
of
thyrsis
and
corydon
pierrot
and
columbine
must
ignore
them
until
the
lines
indicate
their
discovery
no
matter
how
they
may
have
fallen
particular
attention
must
be
given
to
the
chairs
in
this
set
they
are
used
to
construct
the
wall
and
although
delicate
should
be
heavy
enough
to
remain
solid
and
steady
up
and
down
stage
without
the
possibility
of
an
upset
when
corydon
strides
through
the
wall
near
the
footlights
actors
left
are
two
sofa
pillows
used
to
represent
the
rocks
against
which
the
shepherds
lean
on
the
left
of
the
stage
have
another
pillow
which
thyrsis
places
under
his
head
when
he
lies
down
to
sleep
use
cloth
or
crêpe
paper
for
these

surrounding

three
sides
drape
this

heavy
black

the
table
covering
is
important
its
width
is
equal
to
that
of
the
added
height
and
width
of
the
table
as
it
must
be
moved
to
cover
the
bodies
of
thyrsis
and
corydon
it
should
be
of
sufficient
weight
to
prevent
slipping
it
will
be
well
to
experiment
with
this
to
ensure
proper
performance
the
cover
should
have
black
and
white
spots
and
striped
ends
the
table
is
set
as
follows
large
wooden
bowls
at

seven
inches
high
and
fourteen
inches
in
diameter
one
is
placed
at
each
end
of

at

exotic

confetti
and
colored
paper

the
latter
showing
plainly
over

macaroons
put
them
into

place
a
practical
uncooked
artichoke
have
this
of
good
size
and
nail
it
to
a
wooden
standard
painted
black
at
both
places
there
are
tall
white
wooden
goblets
in
the

there
should
be

grotesque

very
gay
flower

of
wood
or
heavy
paper
which
will
not
break
when
thyrsis
drops
it
concealed
at
the
root
of
this
plant
there
should
be
a
small
sack
of
black
confetti
to
be
used
in

should
be

nothing

cheap
material
fastened
to
the
tunics
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
appear
to
be
simply
flung
over
the
shoulder
but
actually
fastened
very
cleverly
in
order
to
avoid
tripping
the
shepherds
who
are
continually
sitting
down
on
the
floor
and
getting
up
again
thyrsis
wears
a
dark
grey
tunic
and
cloak
of
raw
bright
red
not
a
as
this
color
will
kill
the
blue
of
corydon
s
cloak
corydon
wears
tunic
of
light
grey
and
cloak
of
brilliant
blue
there
must
be
no
red
or
blue
used
anywhere
in
the
entire
play
excepting
in
the
blue
and
red
of
these
two
cloaks
the
two
shepherds
must
be
so
strong
and
vivid
in
every
way
that
when
columbine
comes
in
and
says
is
this
my
scene
or
not
it
will
seem
to
the
audience
that
it
is
she
not
the
shepherds
who
is
hopelessly
out
of
the
scene
characters
pierrot
pierrot
sees
clearly
into
existing
evils
and
is
rendered
gaily
cynical
by
them
he
is
both
too
indolent
and
too
indifferent
to
do
anything
about
it
yet
in
several
lines
of
the
play
his
actual
unhappiness
is
seen
instance
moon
s
just
a
word
to
swear
by
in
which
he
expresses
his
conviction
that
all
beauty
and
romance
are
fled
from
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
play
the
line
yes
and
yet
i
dare
say
he
is
just
as
dead
must
not
be
said
flippantly
or
cynically
but
slowly
and
with
much
philosophic
concentration
on
the
thought
from
the
moment
when
columbine
cries
what
s
that
there
under
the
table
until
pierrot
calls
cothurnus
come
drag
these
bodies
out
of
here
they
both
stand
staring
at
the
two
bodies
without
moving
in
any
way
or
even
lifting
their
eyes
this
same
of
the
play
is
used
several
times
also
by
the
shepherds
instance
always
during
the
interpolations
they
stand
either
staring
at
each
other
across
the
wall
or
maintaining
whatever
other
position
they
may
have
had
when
the
voice
begins
speaking
until
the
interruption
is
over
when
they
resume
their
drama
quite
as
if
nobody
had
spoken
columbine
s
how
curious
to
strangle
him
like
that
is
spoken
extremely
slowly
in
a
voice
of
awe
curiosity
and
horror
for
a
moment
the
two
characters
seem
almost
to
feel
and
be
subdued
by
the
tragedy
that
has
taken
place
they
remain
standing
very
quietly
while
cothurnus
speaks
his
final
lines
off
stage
and
for
a
moment
after
he
has
said
the
audience
will
forget
then
very
slowly
raise
their
eyes
and
exchange
glances
pierrot
nods
his
head
curtly
and
says
that
s
so
they
set
their
bowls
gaily
back
on
the
table
and
the
play
begins
again
pierrot
in
such
lines
as
ah
columbine
as
if
it
mattered
speaks
with
mock
saccharine
tenderness
but
in
such
lines
as
if
you
were
a
fly
you
would
be
dead
by
now
although
he
speaks
very
gaily
his
malice
must
be
apparent
almost
even
to
her
columbine
bores
him
to
death
when
he
says
i
ll
go
and
strum
the
moon
he
is
for
the
instant
genuinely
excited
and
interested
he
is
for
this
moment
like
a
child
and
is
happy
columbine
pretty
and
charming
but
stupid
she
never
knows
what
pierrot
is
talking
about
and
is
so
accustomed
to
him
that
she
no
longer
pretends
to
understand
him
but
she
is
very
proud
of
him
and
when
he
speaks
she
listens
with
trustful
admiration
her
expression
i
can
not
live
without
this
or
that
is
a
phrase
she
uses
in
order
to
make
herself
more
attractive
because
she
believes
men
prefer
women
to
be
useless
and
extravagant
if
left
to
herself
she
would
be
a
domestic
and
capable
person
cothurnus
this
character
should
be
played
by
a
tall
and
imposing
figure
with
a
tremendous
voice
the
voice
of
cothurnus
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
in
the
acting
play
he
should
have
a
voice
deeper
than
the
voice
used
by
any
of
the
other
persons
should
speak
weightily
and
with
great
dignity
but
almost
without
intonation
and
quite
without
feeling
as
if
he
had
said
the
same
words
many
times
before
only
in
his
last
speech
may
he
be
permitted
a
comment
on
the
situation
this
speech
should
be
spoken
quite
as
impressively
as
the
others
and
fully
as
slowly
corydon
and
thyrsis
these
two
characters
are
young
very
simple
and
childlike
they
are
acted
upon
by
the
force
that
sits
on
the
back
of
the
stage
behind
them
more
and
more
as
their
quarrel
advances
they
begin
to
see
that
something
is
wrong
but
they
have
no
idea
what
to
do
about
it
and
they
scarcely
realize
what
is
happening
the
quarrel
grows
so
from
little
things
into
big
things
corydon
s
first
vision
of
the
tragedy
is
in
it
s
terrible
when
you
stop
to
think
of
thyrsis
first
vision
comes
when
he
looks
into
the
pool
in
seeing
the
familiar
reflection
he
is
struck
by
the
unfamiliarity
of
one
aspect
of
it
the
poisonous
root
for
the
first
time
he
realizes
that
this
man
who
is
about
to
kill
with
poisoned
water
his
most
beloved
friend
is
none
other
than
thyrsis
tis
i
the
personalities
of
thyrsis
and
corydon
are
not
essentially
different
they
develop
somewhat
differently
because
of
the
differing
circumstances
when
columbine
goes
out
for
the
first
time
she
takes
with
her
her
artichoke
and
her
also
a
couple
of
macaroons
which
she
nibbles
going
out
this
helps
to
get
the
table
cleared
the
other
articles
are
removed
by
the
shepherds
when
they
prepare
the
stage
for
their
scene
in
this
manner
at
the
cue
sir
we
are
always
ready
play
the
play
corydon
and
thyrsis
come
down
stage
corydon
to
pierrot
s
end
of
the
table
thyrsis
to
columbia
s
simultaneously
first
they
set
back
the
chairs
against
the
wall
pierrot
s
left
front
columbine
s
right
front
next
they
remove
the
two
big
bowls
and
set
them
in
symmetrical
positions
on
the
floor
left
front
and
right
front
in
such
a
way
that
the
bowl
of
confetti
may
be
the
mine
of
jewels
for
corydon
and
the
bowl
of
fruits
the
may
represent
the
pool
of
water
for
thyrsis
then
taking
the
table
by
the
two
ends
they
set
it
back
against
the
wall
right
next
while
corydon
places
the
two
pillows
from
the
left
wall
on
the
floor
to
represent
rocks
in
their
pasture
thyrsis
removes
from
the
table
everything
that
is
left
on
it
except
the
tablecloth
should
be
only
pierrot
s
and
the
flower
in
its
pot
the
flower
is
to
represent
later
the
poisonous
weed
which
thyrsis
finds
the
a
beside
the
pool
the
a
bowl
in
which
to
mix
the
poison
and
bring
it
to
corydon
the
two
shepherds
do
this
setting
of
their
stage
swiftly
and
silently
then
seat
themselves
at
once
in
easy
but
beautiful
postures
and
remain
for
a
moment
looking
off
as
if
at
their
sheep
while
a
complete
silence
settles
over
the
stage
and
house
silence
if
it
is
possible
to
suggest
they
begin
to
speak
when
columbine
comes
in
looking
for
her
hat
she
picks
up
the
hat
from
her
chair
now
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
near
the
footlights
in
a
direct
line
with
pierrot
s
which
is
centre
back
just
in
front
of
cothurnus
shepherds
having
set
them
in
these
positions
back
to
back
in
order
to
have
their
aid
in
weaving
the
wall
after
taking
her
hat
columbine
stands
looking
at
the
shepherds
to
see
what
is
going
on
they
do
not
look
at
her
after
a
moment
thyrsis
slowly
with
his
eyes
steadfastly
on
corydon
s
says
take
it
and
when
columbine
comes
in
in
the
final
scene
she
is
wearing
the
hat
she
takes
it
off
however
as
she
sits
down
again
at
the
table
so
that
the
second
beginning
of
the
play
may
recall
as
vividly
as
possible
to
the
audience
the
first
beginning
