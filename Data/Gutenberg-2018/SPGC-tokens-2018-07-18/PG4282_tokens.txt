chronicles
of
shadow
valley
by
lord
dunsany
to
william
beebe
chronology
after
long
and
patient
research
i
am
still
unable
to
give
to
the
reader
of
these
chronicles
the
exact
date
of
the
times
that
they
tell
of
were
it
merely
a
matter
of
history
there
could
be
no
doubts
about
the
period
but
where
magic
is
concerned
to
however
slight
an
extent
there
must
always
be
some
element
of
mystery
arising
partly
out
of
ignorance
and
partly
from
the
compulsion
of
those
oaths
by
which
magic
protects
its
precincts
from
the
tiptoe
of
curiosity
moreover
magic
even
in
small
quantities
appears
to
affect
time
much
as
acids
affect
some
metals
curiously
changing
its
substance
until
dates
seem
to
melt
into
a
mercurial
form
that
renders
them
elusive
even
to
the
eye
of
the
most
watchful
historian
it
is
the
magic
appearing
in
chronicles
iii
and
iv
that
has
gravely
affected
the
date
so
that
all
i
can
tell
the
reader
with
certainty
of
the
period
is
that
it
fell
in
the
later
years
of
the
golden

don
rodriguez
the
first
chronicle
how
he
met
and
said
farewell
to
mine
host
of
the
dragon
and
knight
being
convinced
that
his
end
was
nearly
come
and
having
lived
long
on
earth
and
all
those
years
in
spain
in
the
golden
time
the
lord
of
the
valleys
of
arguento
harez
whose
heights
see
not
valladolid
called
for
his
eldest
son
and
so
he
addressed
him
when
he
was
come
to
his
chamber
dim
with
its
strange
red
hangings
and
august
with
the
splendour
of
spain
o
eldest
son
of
mine
your
younger
brother
being
dull
and
clever
on
whom
those
traits
that
women
love
have
not
been
bestowed
by
god
and
know
my
eldest
son
that
here
on
earth
and
for
ought
i
know
hereafter
but
certainly
here
on
earth
these
women
be
the
arbiters
of
all
things
and
how
this
be
so
god
knoweth
only
for
they
are
vain
and
variable
yet
it
is
surely
so
your
younger
brother
then
not
having
been
given
those
ways
that
women
prize
and
god
knows
why
they
prize
them
for
they
are
vain
ways
that
i
have
in
my
mind
and
that
won
me
the
valleys
of
arguento
harez
from
whose
heights
angelico
swore
he
saw
valladolid
once
and
that
won
me
moreover
also
but
that
is
long
ago
and
is
all
gone
now
ah
well
well
what
was
i
saying
and
being
reminded
of
his
discourse
the
old
lord
continued
saying
for
himself
he
will
win
nothing
and
therefore
i
will
leave
him
these
my
valleys
for
not
unlikely
it
was
for
some
sin
of
mine
that
his
spirit
was
visited
with
dullness
as
holy
writ
sets
forth
the
sins
of
the
fathers
being
visited
on
the
children
and
thus
i
make
him
amends
but
to
you
i
leave
my
long
most
flexible
ancient
castilian
blade
which
infidels
dreaded
if
old
songs
be
true
merry
and
lithe
it
is
and
its
true
temper
singeth
when
it
meets
another
blade
as
two
friends
sing
when
met
after
many
years
it
is
most
subtle
nimble
and
exultant
and
what
it
will
not
win
for
you
in
the
wars
that
shall
be
won
for
you
by
your
mandolin
for
you
have
a
way
with
it
that
goes
well
with
the
old
airs
of
spain
and
choose
my
son
rather
a
moonlight
night
when
you
sing
under
those
curved
balconies
that
i
knew
ah
me
so
well
for
there
is
much
advantage
in
the
moon
in
the
first
place
maidens
see
in
the
light
of
the
moon
especially
in
the
spring
more
romance
than
you
might
credit
for
it
adds
for
them
a
mystery
to
the
darkness
which
the
night
has
not
when
it
is
merely
black
and
if
any
statue
should
gleam
on
the
grass
near
by
or
if
the
magnolia
be
in
blossom
or
even
the
nightingale
singing
or
if
anything
be
beautiful
in
the
night
in
any
of
these
things
also
there
is
advantage
for
a
maiden
will
attribute
to
her
lover
all
manner
of
things
that
are
not
his
at
all
but
are
only
outpourings
from
the
hand
of
god
there
is
this
advantage
also
in
the
moon
that
if
interrupters
come
the
moonlight
is
better
suited
to
the
play
of
a
blade
than
the
mere
darkness
of
night
indeed
but
the
merry
play
of
my
sword
in
the
moonlight
was
often
a
joy
to
see
it
so
flashed
so
danced
so
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
also
one
makes
no
unworthy
stroke
but
hath
scope
for
those
fair
passes
that
sevastiani
taught
which
were
long
ago
the
wonder
of
madrid
the
old
lord
paused
and
breathed
for
a
little
space
as
it
were
gathering
breath
for
his
last
words
to
his
son
he
breathed
deliberately
then
spoke
again
i
leave
you
he
said
well
content
that
you
have
the
two
accomplishments
my
son
that
are
most
needful
in
a
christian
man
skill
with
the
sword
and
a
way
with
the
mandolin
there
be
other
arts
indeed
among
the
heathen
for
the
world
is
wide
and
hath
full
many
customs
but
these
two
alone
are
needful
and
then
with
that
grand
manner
that
they
had
at
that
time
in
spain
although
his
strength
was
failing
he
gave
to
his
eldest
son
his
castilian
sword
he
lay
back
then
in
the
huge
carved
canopied
bed
his
eyes
closed
the
red
silk
curtains
rustled
and
there
was
no
sound
of
his
breathing
but
the
old
lord
spirit
whatever
journey
it
purposed
lingered
yet
in
its
ancient
habitation
and
his
voice
came
again
but
feebly
now
and
rambling
he
muttered
awhile
of
gardens
such
gardens
no
doubt
as
the
hidalgos
guarded
in
that
fertile
region
of
sunshine
in
the
proudest
period
of
spain
he
would
have
known
no
others
so
for
awhile
his
memory
seemed
to
stray
half
blind
among
those
perfumed
earthly
wonders
perhaps
among
these
memories
his
spirit
halted
and
tarried
those
last
few
moments
mistaking
those
spanish
gardens
remembered
by
moonlight
in
spring
for
the
other
end
of
his
journey
the
glades
of
paradise
however
it
be
it
tarried
these
rambling
memories
ceased
and
silence
fell
again
with
scarcely
the
sound
of
breathing
then
gathering
up
his
strength
for
the
last
time
and
looking
at
his
son
the
sword
to
the
wars
he
said
the
mandolin
to
the
balconies
with
that
he
fell
back
dead
now
there
were
no
wars
at
that
time
so
far
as
was
known
in
spain
but
that
old
lord
eldest
son
regarding
those
last
words
of
his
father
as
a
commandment
determined
then
and
there
in
that
dim
vast
chamber
to
gird
his
legacy
to
him
and
seek
for
the
wars
wherever
the
wars
might
be
so
soon
as
the
obsequies
of
the
sepulture
were
ended
and
of
those
obsequies
i
tell
not
here
for
they
are
fully
told
in
the
black
books
of
spain
and
the
deeds
of
that
old
lord
youth
are
told
in
the
golden
stories
the
book
of
maidens
mentions
him
and
again
we
read
of
him
in
gardens
of
spain
i
take
my
leave
of
him
happy
i
trust
in
paradise
for
he
had
himself
the
accomplishments
that
he
held
needful
in
a
christian
skill
with
the
sword
and
a
way
with
the
mandolin
and
if
there
be
some
harder
better
way
to
salvation
than
to
follow
that
which
we
believe
to
be
good
then
are
we
all
damned
so
he
was
buried
and
his
eldest
son
fared
forth
with
his
legacy
dangling
from
his
girdle
in
its
long
straight
lovely
scabbard
blue
velvet
with
emeralds
on
it
fared
forth
on
foot
along
a
road
of
spain
and
though
the
road
turned
left
and
right
and
sometimes
nearly
ceased
as
though
to
let
the
small
wild
flowers
grow
out
of
sheer
good
will
such
as
some
roads
never
have
though
it
ran
west
and
east
and
sometimes
south
yet
in
the
main
it
ran
northward
though
wandered
is
a
better
word
than
ran
and
the
lord
of
the
valleys
of
arguento
harez
who
owned
no
valleys
or
anything
but
a
sword
kept
company
with
it
looking
for
the
wars
upon
his
back
he
had
slung
his
mandolin
now
the
time
of
the
year
was
spring
not
spring
as
we
know
it
in
england
for
it
was
but
early
march
but
it
was
the
time
when
spring
coming
up
out
of
africa
or
unknown
lands
to
the
south
first
touches
spain
and
multitudes
of
anemones
come
forth
at
her
feet
thence
she
comes
north
to
our
islands
no
less
wonderful
in
our
woods
than
in
andalusian
valleys
fresh
as
a
new
song
fabulous
as
a
rune
but
a
little
pale
through
travel
so
that
our
flowers
do
not
quite
flare
forth
with
all
the
myriad
blaze
of
the
flowers
of
spain
and
all
the
way
as
he
went
the
young
man
looked
at
the
flame
of
those
southern
flowers
flashing
on
either
side
of
him
all
the
way
as
though
the
rainbow
had
been
broken
in
heaven
and
its
fragments
fallen
on
spain
all
the
way
as
he
went
he
gazed
at
those
flowers
the
first
anemones
of
the
year
and
long
after
whenever
he
sang
to
old
airs
of
spain
he
thought
of
spain
as
it
appeared
that
day
in
all
the
wonder
of
spring
the
memory
lent
a
beauty
to
his
voice
and
a
wistfulness
to
his
eyes
that
accorded
not
ill
with
the
theme
of
the
songs
he
sang
and
were
more
than
once
to
melt
proud
hearts
deemed
cold
and
so
gazing
he
came
to
a
town
that
stood
on
a
hill
before
he
was
yet
tired
though
he
had
done
nigh
twenty
of
those
flowery
miles
of
spain
and
since
it
was
evening
and
the
light
was
fading
away
he
went
to
an
inn
and
drew
his
sword
in
the
twilight
and
knocked
with
the
hilt
of
it
on
the
oaken
door
the
name
of
it
was
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
a
light
was
lit
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
the
darkness
seemed
to
deepen
at
that
moment
a
step
was
heard
coming
heavily
down
a
stairway
and
having
named
the
inn
to
you
gentle
reader
it
is
time
for
me
to
name
the
young
man
also
the
landless
lord
of
the
valleys
of
arguento
harez
as
the
step
comes
slowly
down
the
inner
stairway
as
the
gloaming
darkens
over
the
first
house
in
which
he
has
ever
sought
shelter
so
far
from
his
father
valleys
as
he
stands
upon
the
threshold
of
romance
he
was
named
rodriguez
trinidad
fernandez
concepcion
henrique
maria
but
we
shall
briefly
name
him
rodriguez
in
this
story
you
and
i
reader
will
know
whom
we
mean
there
is
no
need
therefore
to
give
him
his
full
names
unless
i
do
it
here
and
there
to
remind
you
the
steps
came
thumping
on
down
the
inner
stairway
different
windows
took
the
light
of
the
candle
and
none
other
shone
in
the
house
it
was
clear
that
it
was
moving
with
the
steps
all
down
that
echoing
stairway
the
sound
of
the
steps
ceased
to
reverberate
upon
the
wood
and
now
they
slowly
moved
over
stone
flags
rodriguez
now
heard
breathing
one
breath
with
every
step
and
at
length
the
sound
of
bolts
and
chains
undone
and
the
breathing
now
very
close
the
door
was
opened
swiftly
a
man
with
mean
eyes
and
expression
devoted
to
evil
stood
watching
him
for
an
instant
then
the
door
slammed
to
again
the
bolts
were
heard
going
back
again
to
their
places
the
steps
and
the
breathing
moved
away
over
the
stone
floor
and
the
inner
stairway
began
again
to
echo
if
the
wars
are
here
said
rodriguez
to
himself
and
his
sword
good
and
i
sleep
under
the
stars
and
he
listened
in
the
street
for
the
sound
of
war
and
hearing
none
continued
his
discourse
but
if
i
have
not
come
as
yet
to
the
wars
i
sleep
beneath
a
roof
for
the
second
time
therefore
he
drew
his
sword
and
began
to
strike
methodically
at
the
door
noting
the
grain
in
the
wood
and
hitting
where
it
was
softest
scarcely
had
he
got
a
good
strip
of
the
oak
to
look
like
coming
away
when
the
steps
once
more
descended
the
wooden
stair
and
came
lumbering
over
the
stones
both
the
steps
and
the
breathing
were
quicker
for
mine
host
of
the
dragon
and
knight
was
hurrying
to
save
his
door
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
bolts
and
chains
again
rodriguez
ceased
to
beat
upon
the
door
once
more
it
opened
swiftly
and
he
saw
mine
host
before
him
eyeing
him
with
those
bad
eyes
of
too
much
girth
you
might
have
said
to
be
nimble
yet
somehow
suggesting
to
the
swift
intuition
of
youth
as
rodriguez
looked
at
him
standing
upon
his
the
spirit
and
shape
of
a
spider
who
despite
her
ungainly
build
is
agile
enough
in
her
way
mine
host
said
nothing
and
rodriguez
who
seldom
concerned
himself
with
the
past
holding
that
the
future
is
all
we
can
order
the
scheme
of
and
maybe
even
here
he
was
wrong
made
no
mention
of
bolts
or
door
and
merely
demanded
a
bed
for
himself
for
the
night
mine
host
rubbed
his
chin
he
had
neither
beard
nor
moustache
but
wore
hideous
whiskers
he
rubbed
it
thoughtfully
and
looked
at
rodriguez
yes
he
said
he
could
have
a
bed
for
the
night
no
more
words
he
said
but
turned
and
led
the
way
while
rodriguez
who
could
sing
to
the
mandolin
wasted
none
of
his
words
on
this
discourteous
object
they
ascended
the
short
oak
stairway
down
which
mine
host
had
come
the
great
timbers
of
which
were
gnawed
by
a
myriad
rats
and
they
went
by
passages
with
the
light
of
one
candle
into
the
interior
of
the
inn
which
went
back
farther
from
the
street
than
the
young
man
had
supposed
indeed
he
perceived
when
they
came
to
the
great
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
was
his
appointed
chamber
that
here
was
no
ordinary
inn
as
it
had
appeared
from
outside
but
that
it
penetrated
into
the
fastness
of
some
great
family
of
former
times
which
had
fallen
on
evil
days
the
vast
size
of
it
the
noble
design
where
the
rats
had
spared
the
carving
what
the
moths
had
left
of
the
tapestries
all
testified
to
that
and
as
for
the
evil
days
they
hung
about
the
place
evident
even
by
the
light
of
one
candle
guttering
with
every
draught
that
blew
from
the
haunts
of
the
rats
an
inseparable
heirloom
for
all
who
disturbed
those
corridors
and
so
they
came
to
the
chamber
mine
host
entered
bowed
without
grace
in
the
doorway
and
extended
his
left
hand
pointing
into
the
room
the
draughts
that
blew
from
the
in
the
wainscot
or
the
mere
action
of
entering
beat
down
the
flame
of
the
squat
guttering
candle
so
that
the
chamber
remained
dim
for
a
moment
in
spite
of
the
candle
as
would
naturally
be
the
case
yet
the
impression
made
upon
rodriguez
was
as
of
some
old
darkness
that
had
been
long
undisturbed
and
that
yielded
reluctantly
to
that
candle
intrusion
a
darkness
that
properly
became
the
place
and
was
a
part
of
it
and
had
long
been
so
in
the
face
of
which
the
candle
appeared
an
ephemeral
thing
devoid
of
grace
or
dignity
or
tradition
and
indeed
there
was
room
for
darkness
in
that
chamber
for
the
walls
went
up
and
up
into
such
an
altitude
that
you
could
scarcely
see
the
ceiling
at
which
mine
host
eyes
glanced
and
rodriguez
followed
his
look
he
accepted
his
accommodation
with
a
nod
as
indeed
he
would
have
accepted
any
room
in
that
inn
for
the
young
are
swift
judges
of
character
and
one
who
had
accepted
such
a
host
was
unlikely
to
find
fault
with
rats
or
the
profusion
of
giant
cobwebs
dark
with
the
dust
of
years
that
added
so
much
to
the
dimness
of
that
sinister
inn
they
turned
now
and
went
back
in
the
wake
of
that
guttering
candle
till
they
came
again
to
the
humbler
part
of
the
building
here
mine
host
pushing
open
a
door
of
blackened
oak
indicated
his
there
a
long
table
stood
and
on
it
parts
of
the
head
and
hams
of
a
boar
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
a
plump
and
sturdy
man
was
seated
in
feasting
himself
on
the
boar
meat
he
leaped
up
at
once
from
his
chair
as
soon
as
his
master
entered
for
he
was
the
servant
at
the
dragon
and
knight
mine
host
may
have
said
much
to
him
with
a
flash
of
his
eyes
but
he
said
no
more
with
his
tongue
than
the
one
word
dog
he
then
bowed
himself
out
leaving
rodriguez
to
take
the
only
chair
and
to
be
waited
upon
by
its
recent
possessor
the
boar
meat
was
cold
and
gnarled
another
piece
of
meat
stood
on
a
plate
on
a
shelf
and
a
loaf
of
bread
near
by
but
the
rats
had
had
most
of
the
bread
rodriguez
demanded
what
the
meat
was
unicorn
tongue
said
the
servant
and
rodriguez
bade
him
set
the
dish
before
him
and
he
set
to
well
content
though
i
fear
the
unicorn
tongue
was
only
horse
it
was
a
credulous
age
as
all
ages
are
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
to
a
stool
that
he
perceived
in
a
corner
of
the
room
then
to
the
table
then
to
the
boar
meat
and
lastly
at
the
servant
who
perceived
that
he
was
permitted
to
return
to
his
feast
to
which
he
ran
with
alacrity
your
name
said
rodriguez
as
soon
as
both
were
eating
morano
replied
the
servant
though
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
when
answering
rodriguez
he
spoke
as
curtly
as
this
i
merely
give
the
reader
the
gist
of
his
answer
for
he
added
spanish
words
that
correspond
in
our
depraved
and
decadent
language
of
to
such
words
as
top
dog
nut
and
boss
so
that
his
speech
had
a
certain
grace
about
it
in
that
time
in
spain
i
have
said
that
rodriguez
seldom
concerned
himself
with
the
past
but
considered
chiefly
the
future
it
was
of
the
future
that
he
was
thinking
now
as
he
asked
morano
this
question
why
did
my
worthy
and
entirely
excellent
host
shut
his
door
in
my
face
did
he
so
said
morano
he
then
bolted
it
and
found
it
necessary
to
put
the
chains
back
doubtless
for
some
good
reason
yes
said
morano
thoughtfully
and
looking
at
rodriguez
and
so
he
might
he
must
have
liked
you
verily
rodriguez
was
just
the
young
man
to
send
out
with
a
sword
and
a
mandolin
into
the
wide
world
for
he
had
much
shrewd
sense
he
never
pressed
a
point
but
when
something
had
been
said
that
might
mean
much
he
preferred
to
store
it
as
it
were
in
his
mind
and
pass
on
to
other
things
somewhat
as
one
might
kill
game
and
pass
on
and
kill
more
and
bring
it
all
home
while
a
savage
would
cook
the
first
kill
where
it
fell
and
eat
it
on
the
spot
pardon
me
reader
but
at
morano
remark
you
may
perhaps
have
exclaimed
that
is
not
the
way
to
treat
one
you
like
not
so
did
rodriguez
his
attention
passed
on
to
notice
rings
which
he
wore
in
great
profusion
upon
his
little
fingers
they
were
gold
and
of
exquisite
work
and
had
once
held
precious
stones
as
large
gaps
testified
in
these
days
they
would
have
been
priceless
but
in
an
age
when
workers
only
worked
at
arts
that
they
understood
and
then
worked
for
the
joy
of
it
before
the
word
artistic
became
ridiculous
exquisite
work
went
without
saying
and
as
the
rings
were
slender
they
were
of
little
value
rodriguez
made
no
comment
upon
the
rings
it
was
enough
for
him
to
have
noticed
them
he
merely
noted
that
they
were
not
ladies
rings
for
no
lady
ring
would
have
fitted
on
to
any
one
of
those
fingers
the
rings
therefore
of
gallants
and
not
given
to
morano
by
their
owners
for
whoever
wore
precious
stone
needed
a
ring
to
wear
it
in
and
rings
did
not
wear
out
like
hose
which
a
gallant
might
give
to
a
servant
nor
thought
he
had
morano
stolen
them
for
whoever
stole
them
would
keep
them
whole
or
part
with
them
whole
and
get
a
better
price
besides
morano
had
an
honest
face
or
a
face
at
least
that
seemed
honest
in
such
an
inn
and
while
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
morano
spoke
again
good
hams
said
morano
he
had
already
eaten
one
and
was
starting
upon
the
next
perhaps
he
spoke
out
of
gratitude
for
the
honour
and
physical
advantage
of
being
permitted
to
sit
there
and
eat
those
hams
perhaps
tentatively
to
find
out
whether
he
might
consume
the
second
perhaps
merely
to
start
a
conversation
being
attracted
by
the
honest
looks
of
rodriguez
you
are
hungry
said
rodriguez
praise
god
i
am
always
hungry
answered
morano
if
i
were
not
hungry
i
should
starve
is
it
so
said
rodriguez
you
see
said
morano
the
manner
of
it
is
this
my
master
gives
me
no
food
and
it
is
only
when
i
am
hungry
that
i
dare
to
rob
him
by
breaking
in
as
you
saw
me
upon
his
viands
were
i
not
hungry
i
should
not
dare
to
do
so
and
so
he
made
a
sad
and
expressive
movement
with
both
his
hands
suggestive
of
autumn
leaves
blown
hence
to
die
he
gives
you
no
food
said
rodriguez
it
is
the
way
of
many
men
with
their
dog
said
morano
they
give
him
no
food
and
then
he
rubbed
his
hands
cheerfully
and
yet
the
dog
does
not
die
and
he
gives
you
no
wages
said
rodriguez
just
these
rings
now
rodriguez
had
himself
a
ring
upon
his
finger
as
a
gallant
should
a
slender
piece
of
gold
with
four
tiny
angels
holding
a
sapphire
and
for
a
moment
he
pictured
the
sapphire
passing
into
the
hands
of
mine
host
and
the
ring
of
gold
and
the
four
small
angels
being
flung
to
morano
the
thought
darkened
his
gaiety
for
no
longer
than
one
of
those
fleecy
clouds
in
spring
shadows
the
fields
of
spain
morano
was
also
looking
at
the
ring
he
had
followed
the
young
glance
master
he
said
do
you
draw
your
sword
of
a
night
and
you
said
rodriguez
i
have
no
sword
said
morano
i
am
but
as
dog
meat
that
needs
no
guarding
but
you
whose
meat
is
rare
like
the
flesh
of
the
unicorn
need
a
sword
to
guard
your
meat
the
unicorn
has
his
horn
always
and
even
then
he
sometimes
sleeps
it
is
bad
you
think
to
sleep
rodriguez
said
for
some
it
is
very
bad
master
they
say
they
never
take
the
unicorn
waking
for
me
i
am
but
dog
meat
when
i
have
eaten
hams
i
curl
up
and
sleep
but
then
you
see
master
i
know
i
shall
wake
in
the
morning
ah
said
rodriguez
the
morning
a
pleasant
time
and
he
leaned
back
comfortably
in
his
chair
morano
took
one
shrewd
look
at
him
and
was
soon
asleep
upon
his
stool
the
door
opened
after
a
while
and
mine
host
appeared
it
is
late
he
said
rodriguez
smiled
acquiescently
and
mine
host
withdrew
and
presently
leaving
morano
whom
his
master
voice
had
waked
to
curl
up
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
rodriguez
took
the
candle
that
lit
the
room
and
passed
once
more
through
the
passages
of
the
inn
and
down
the
great
corridor
of
the
fastness
of
the
family
that
had
fallen
on
evil
days
and
so
came
to
his
chamber
i
will
not
waste
a
multitude
of
words
over
that
chamber
if
you
have
no
picture
of
it
in
your
mind
already
my
reader
you
are
reading
an
unskilled
writer
and
if
in
that
picture
it
appear
a
wholesome
room
tidy
and
well
kept
up
if
it
appear
a
place
in
which
a
stranger
might
sleep
without
some
faint
foreboding
of
disaster
then
i
am
wasting
your
time
and
will
waste
no
more
of
it
with
bits
of
descriptive
writing
about
that
dim
high
room
whose
blackness
towered
before
rodriguez
in
the
night
he
entered
and
shut
the
door
as
many
had
done
before
him
but
for
all
his
youth
he
took
some
wiser
precautions
than
had
they
perhaps
who
closed
that
door
before
for
first
he
drew
his
sword
then
for
some
while
he
stood
quite
still
near
the
door
and
listened
to
the
rats
then
he
looked
round
the
chamber
and
perceived
only
one
door
then
he
looked
at
the
heavy
oak
furniture
carved
by
some
artist
gnawed
by
rats
and
all
blackened
by
time
then
swiftly
opened
the
door
of
the
largest
cupboard
and
thrust
his
sword
in
to
see
who
might
be
inside
but
the
carved
satyr
heads
at
the
top
of
the
cupboard
eyed
him
silently
and
nothing
moved
then
he
noted
that
though
there
was
no
bolt
on
the
door
the
furniture
might
be
placed
across
to
make
what
in
the
wars
is
called
a
barricado
but
the
wiser
thought
came
at
once
that
this
was
too
easily
done
and
that
if
the
danger
that
the
dim
room
seemed
gloomily
to
forebode
were
to
come
from
a
door
so
readily
barricadoed
then
those
must
have
been
simple
gallants
who
parted
so
easily
with
the
rings
that
adorned
morano
two
little
fingers
no
it
was
something
more
subtle
than
any
attack
through
that
door
that
brought
his
regular
wages
to
morano
rodriguez
looked
at
the
window
which
let
in
the
light
of
a
moon
that
was
getting
low
for
the
curtains
had
years
ago
been
eaten
up
by
the
moths
but
the
window
was
barred
with
iron
bars
that
were
not
yet
rusted
away
and
looked
out
thus
guarded
over
a
sheer
wall
that
even
in
the
moonlight
fell
into
blackness
rodriguez
then
looked
round
for
some
hidden
door
the
sword
all
the
while
in
his
hand
and
very
soon
he
knew
that
room
fairly
well
but
not
its
secret
nor
why
those
unknown
gallants
had
given
up
their
rings
it
is
much
to
know
of
an
unknown
danger
that
it
really
is
unknown
many
have
met
their
deaths
through
looking
for
danger
from
one
particular
direction
whereas
had
they
perceived
that
they
were
ignorant
of
its
direction
they
would
have
been
wise
in
their
ignorance
rodriguez
had
the
great
discretion
to
understand
clearly
that
he
did
not
know
the
direction
from
which
danger
would
come
he
accepted
this
as
his
only
discovery
about
that
portentous
room
which
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
with
every
shadow
and
to
sigh
over
him
with
every
mournful
draught
and
to
whisper
to
him
unintelligible
warnings
with
every
rustle
of
tattered
silk
that
hung
about
his
bed
and
as
soon
as
he
discovered
that
this
was
his
only
knowledge
he
began
at
once
to
make
his
preparations
he
was
a
right
young
man
for
the
wars
he
divested
himself
of
his
shoes
and
doublet
and
the
light
cloak
that
hung
from
his
shoulder
and
cast
the
clothes
on
a
chair
over
the
back
of
the
chair
he
slung
his
girdle
and
the
scabbard
hanging
therefrom
and
placed
his
plumed
hat
so
that
none
could
see
that
his
castilian
blade
was
not
in
its
and
when
the
sombre
chamber
had
the
appearance
of
one
having
undressed
in
it
before
retiring
rodriguez
turned
his
attention
to
the
bed
which
he
noticed
to
be
of
great
depth
and
softness
that
something
not
unlike
blood
had
been
spilt
on
the
floor
excited
no
wonder
in
rodriguez
that
vast
chamber
was
evidently
as
i
have
said
in
the
fortress
of
some
great
family
against
one
of
whose
walls
the
humble
inn
had
once
leaned
for
protection
the
great
family
were
gone
how
they
were
gone
rodriguez
did
not
know
but
it
excited
no
wonder
in
him
to
see
blood
on
the
boards
besides
two
gallants
may
have
disagreed
or
one
who
loved
not
dumb
animals
might
have
been
killing
rats
blood
did
not
disturb
him
but
what
amazed
him
and
would
have
surprised
anyone
who
stood
in
that
ruinous
room
was
that
there
were
clean
new
sheets
on
the
bed
had
you
seen
the
state
of
the
furniture
and
the
floor
o
my
reader
and
the
vastness
of
the
old
cobwebs
and
the
black
dust
that
they
held
the
dead
spiders
and
huge
dead
flies
and
the
living
generation
of
spiders
descending
and
ascending
through
the
gloom
i
say
that
you
also
would
have
been
surprised
at
the
sight
of
those
nice
clean
sheets
rodriguez
noted
the
fact
and
continued
his
preparations
he
took
the
bolster
from
underneath
the
pillow
and
laid
it
down
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
put
the
sheets
back
over
it
then
he
stood
back
and
looked
at
it
much
as
a
sculptor
might
stand
back
from
his
marble
then
he
returned
to
it
and
bent
it
a
little
in
the
middle
and
after
that
he
placed
his
mandolin
on
the
pillow
and
nearly
covered
it
with
the
sheet
but
not
quite
for
a
little
of
the
curved
wood
remained
still
to
be
seen
it
looked
wonderfully
now
like
a
sleeper
in
the
bed
but
rodriguez
was
not
satisfied
with
his
work
until
he
had
placed
his
kerchief
and
one
of
his
shoes
where
a
shoulder
ought
to
be
then
he
stood
back
once
more
and
eyed
it
with
satisfaction
next
he
considered
the
light
he
looked
at
the
light
of
the
moon
and
remembered
his
father
advice
as
the
young
often
do
but
considered
that
this
was
not
the
occasion
for
it
and
decided
to
leave
the
light
of
his
candle
instead
so
that
anyone
who
might
be
familiar
with
the
moonlight
in
that
shadowy
chamber
should
find
instead
a
less
sinister
light
he
therefore
dragged
a
table
to
the
bedside
placed
the
candle
upon
it
and
opened
a
treasured
book
that
he
bore
in
his
doublet
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
near
by
between
the
candle
and
his
sleeper
the
name
of
the
book
was
notes
in
a
cathedral
and
dealt
with
the
confessions
of
a
young
girl
which
the
author
claimed
to
have
jotted
down
while
concealed
behind
a
pillow
near
the
confessional
every
sunday
for
the
entire
period
of
lent
lastly
he
pulled
a
sheet
a
little
loose
from
the
bed
until
a
corner
of
it
lay
on
the
floor
then
he
lay
down
on
the
boards
still
keeping
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
by
means
of
the
sheet
and
some
silk
that
hung
from
the
bed
he
concealed
himself
sufficient
for
his
purpose
which
was
to
see
before
he
should
be
seen
by
any
intruder
that
might
enter
that
chamber
and
if
rodriguez
appear
to
have
been
unduly
suspicious
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
not
only
that
those
empty
rings
needed
much
explanation
but
that
every
house
suggests
to
the
stranger
something
and
that
whereas
one
house
seems
to
promise
a
welcome
in
front
of
cosy
fires
another
good
fare
another
joyous
wine
this
inn
seemed
to
promise
murder
or
so
the
young
man
intuition
said
and
the
young
are
wise
to
trust
to
their
intuitions
the
reader
will
know
if
he
be
one
of
us
who
have
been
to
the
wars
and
slept
in
curious
ways
that
it
is
hard
to
sleep
when
sober
upon
a
floor
it
is
not
like
the
earth
or
snow
or
a
feather
bed
even
rock
can
be
more
accommodating
it
is
hard
unyielding
and
level
all
night
unmistakable
floor
yet
rodriguez
took
no
risk
of
falling
asleep
so
he
said
over
to
himself
in
his
mind
as
much
as
he
remembered
of
his
treasured
book
notes
in
a
cathedral
which
he
always
read
to
himself
before
going
to
rest
and
now
so
sadly
missed
it
told
how
a
lady
who
had
listened
to
a
lover
longer
than
her
soul
safety
could
warrant
as
he
played
languorous
music
in
the
moonlight
and
sang
soft
by
her
low
balcony
and
how
she
being
truly
penitent
had
gathered
many
roses
the
emblems
of
love
as
surely
she
said
at
confession
all
the
world
knows
and
when
her
lover
came
again
by
moonlight
had
cast
them
all
from
her
from
the
balcony
showing
that
she
had
renounced
love
and
her
lover
had
entirely
misunderstood
her
it
told
how
she
often
tried
to
show
him
this
again
and
all
the
misunderstandings
are
sweetly
set
forth
and
with
true
christian
penitence
sometimes
some
little
matter
escaped
rodriguez
memory
and
then
he
longed
to
rise
up
and
look
at
his
dear
book
yet
he
lay
still
where
he
was
and
all
the
while
he
listened
to
the
rats
and
the
rats
went
on
gnawing
and
running
regularly
scared
by
nothing
new
rodriguez
trusted
as
much
to
their
myriad
ears
as
to
his
own
two
the
great
spiders
descended
out
of
such
heights
that
you
could
not
see
whence
they
came
and
ascended
again
into
blackness
it
was
a
chamber
of
prodigious
height
sometimes
the
shadow
of
a
descending
spider
that
had
come
close
to
the
candle
assumed
a
frightening
size
but
rodriguez
gave
little
thought
to
it
it
was
of
murder
he
was
thinking
not
of
shadows
still
in
its
way
it
was
ominous
and
reminded
rodriguez
horribly
of
his
host
but
what
of
an
omen
again
in
a
chamber
full
of
omens
the
place
itself
was
ominous
spiders
could
scarce
make
it
more
so
the
spider
itself
was
big
enough
he
thought
to
be
impaled
on
his
castilian
blade
indeed
he
would
have
done
it
but
that
he
thought
it
wiser
to
stay
where
he
was
and
watch
and
then
the
spider
found
the
candle
too
hot
and
climbed
in
a
hurry
all
the
way
to
the
ceiling
and
his
horrible
shadow
grew
less
and
dwindled
away
it
was
not
that
the
rats
were
frightened
whatever
it
was
that
happened
happened
too
quietly
for
that
but
the
volume
of
the
sound
of
their
running
had
suddenly
increased
it
was
not
like
fear
among
them
for
the
running
was
no
swifter
and
it
did
not
fade
away
it
was
as
though
the
sound
of
rats
running
which
had
not
been
heard
before
was
suddenly
heard
now
rodriguez
looked
at
the
door
the
door
was
shut
a
young
englishman
would
long
ago
have
been
afraid
that
he
was
making
a
fuss
over
nothing
and
would
have
gone
to
sleep
in
the
bed
and
not
seen
what
rodriguez
saw
he
might
have
thought
that
hearing
more
rats
all
at
once
was
merely
a
fancy
and
that
everything
was
all
right
rodriguez
saw
a
rope
coming
slowly
down
from
the
ceiling
he
quickly
determined
whether
it
was
a
rope
or
only
the
shadow
of
some
huge
spider
thread
and
then
he
watched
it
and
saw
it
come
down
right
over
his
bed
and
stop
within
a
few
feet
of
it
rodriguez
looked
up
cautiously
to
see
who
had
sent
him
that
strange
addition
to
the
portents
that
troubled
the
chamber
but
the
ceiling
was
too
high
and
dim
for
him
to
perceive
anything
but
the
rope
coming
down
out
of
the
darkness
yet
he
surmised
that
the
ceiling
must
have
softly
opened
without
any
sound
at
all
at
the
moment
that
he
heard
the
greater
number
of
rats
he
waited
then
to
see
what
the
rope
would
do
and
at
first
it
hung
as
still
as
the
great
festoons
dead
spiders
had
made
in
the
corners
then
as
he
watched
it
it
began
to
sway
he
looked
up
into
the
dimness
then
to
see
who
was
swaying
the
rope
and
for
a
long
time
as
it
seemed
to
him
lying
gripping
his
castilian
sword
on
the
floor
he
saw
nothing
clearly
and
then
he
saw
mine
host
coming
down
the
rope
hand
over
hand
quite
nimbly
as
though
he
lived
by
this
business
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
poniard
of
exceptional
length
yet
he
managed
to
clutch
the
rope
and
hold
the
poniard
all
the
time
with
the
same
hand
if
there
had
been
something
hideous
about
the
shadow
of
the
spider
that
came
down
from
that
height
the
shadow
of
mine
host
was
indeed
demoniac
he
too
was
like
a
spider
with
his
body
at
no
time
slender
all
bunched
up
on
the
rope
and
his
shadow
was
six
times
his
size
you
could
turn
from
the
spider
shadow
to
the
spider
and
see
that
it
was
for
the
most
part
a
fancy
of
the
candle
half
crazed
by
the
draughts
but
to
turn
from
mine
host
shadow
to
himself
and
to
see
his
wicked
eyes
was
to
say
that
the
candle
wildest
fears
were
true
so
he
climbed
down
his
rope
holding
his
poniard
upward
but
when
he
came
within
perhaps
ten
feet
of
the
bed
he
pointed
it
downward
and
began
to
sway
about
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
by
swaying
his
rope
at
a
height
mine
host
could
drop
on
any
part
of
the
bed
rodriguez
as
he
watched
him
saw
him
scrutinise
closely
and
continue
to
sway
on
his
rope
he
feared
that
mine
host
was
ill
satisfied
with
the
look
of
the
mandolin
and
that
he
would
climb
away
again
well
warned
of
his
guest
astuteness
into
the
heights
of
the
ceiling
to
devise
some
fearfuller
scheme
but
he
was
only
looking
for
the
shoulder
and
then
mine
host
dropped
poniard
first
he
went
down
with
all
his
weight
behind
it
and
drove
it
through
the
bolster
below
where
the
shoulder
should
be
just
where
we
slant
our
arms
across
our
bodies
when
we
lie
asleep
on
our
sides
leaving
the
ribs
exposed
and
the
soft
bed
received
him
and
the
moment
that
mine
host
let
go
of
his
rope
rodriguez
leaped
to
his
feet
he
saw
rodriguez
indeed
their
eyes
met
as
he
dropped
through
the
air
but
what
could
mine
host
do
he
was
already
committed
to
his
stroke
and
his
poniard
was
already
deep
in
the
mattress
when
the
good
castilian
blade
passed
through
his
ribs
the
second
chronicle
how
he
hired
a
memorable
servant
when
rodriguez
woke
the
birds
were
singing
gloriously
the
sun
was
up
and
the
air
was
sparkling
over
spain
the
gloom
had
left
his
high
chamber
and
much
of
the
menace
had
gone
from
it
that
overnight
had
seemed
to
bode
in
the
corners
it
had
not
become
suddenly
tidy
it
was
still
more
suitable
for
spiders
than
men
it
still
mourned
and
brooded
over
the
great
family
that
it
had
nursed
and
that
evil
days
had
so
obviously
overtaken
but
it
no
longer
had
the
air
of
finger
to
lips
no
longer
seemed
to
share
a
secret
with
you
and
that
secret
murder
the
rats
still
ran
round
the
wainscot
but
the
song
of
the
birds
and
the
jolly
dazzling
sunshine
were
so
much
larger
than
the
sombre
room
that
the
young
man
thoughts
escaped
from
it
and
ran
free
to
the
fields
it
may
have
been
only
his
fancy
but
the
world
seemed
somehow
brighter
for
the
demise
of
mine
host
of
the
dragon
and
knight
whose
body
still
lay
hunched
up
on
the
foot
of
his
bed
rodriguez
jumped
up
and
went
to
the
high
barred
window
and
looked
out
of
it
at
the
morning
far
below
him
a
little
town
with
red
roofs
lay
the
smoke
came
up
from
the
chimneys
toward
him
slowly
and
spread
out
flat
and
did
not
reach
so
high
between
him
and
the
roofs
swallows
were
sailing
he
found
water
for
washing
in
a
cracked
pitcher
of
earthenware
and
as
he
dressed
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
admired
mine
host
device
for
there
was
an
open
hole
that
had
come
noiselessly
without
any
sounds
of
bolts
or
lifting
of
but
seemed
to
have
opened
out
all
round
on
perfectly
oiled
grooves
to
fit
that
body
and
down
from
the
middle
of
it
from
some
higher
beam
hung
the
rope
down
which
mine
host
had
made
his
last
journey
before
taking
leave
of
his
host
rodriguez
looked
at
his
poniard
which
was
a
good
two
feet
in
length
not
counting
the
hilt
and
was
surprised
to
find
it
an
excellent
blade
it
bore
a
design
on
the
steel
representing
a
town
which
rodriguez
recognised
for
the
towers
of
toledo
and
had
held
moreover
a
jewel
at
the
end
of
the
hilt
but
the
little
gold
socket
was
empty
rodriguez
therefore
perceived
that
the
poniard
was
that
of
a
gallant
and
surmised
that
mine
host
had
begun
his
trade
with
a
butcher
knife
but
having
come
by
the
poniard
had
found
it
to
be
handier
for
his
business
rodriguez
being
now
fully
dressed
girt
his
own
blade
about
him
and
putting
the
poniard
under
his
cloak
for
he
thought
to
find
a
use
for
it
at
the
wars
set
his
plumed
hat
upon
him
and
jauntily
stepped
from
the
chamber
by
the
light
of
day
he
saw
clearly
at
what
point
the
passages
of
the
inn
had
dared
to
make
their
intrusion
on
the
corridors
of
the
fortress
for
he
walked
for
four
paces
between
walls
of
huge
grey
rocks
which
had
never
been
plastered
and
were
clearly
a
breach
in
the
fortress
though
whether
the
breach
were
made
by
one
of
the
evil
days
that
had
come
upon
the
family
in
their
fastness
and
whether
men
had
poured
through
it
with
torches
and
swords
or
whether
the
gap
had
been
cut
in
later
years
for
mine
host
of
the
dragon
and
knight
and
he
had
gone
quietly
through
it
rubbing
his
hands
nothing
remained
to
show
rodriguez
now
when
he
came
to
the
he
found
morano
astir
morano
looked
up
from
his
overwhelming
task
of
tidying
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
and
then
went
on
with
his
pretended
work
for
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
the
knowledge
he
had
concerning
the
ways
of
that
inn
which
was
more
than
an
honest
man
should
know
about
such
a
place
good
morning
morano
said
rodriguez
blithely
good
morning
answered
the
servant
of
the
dragon
and
knight
i
am
looking
for
the
wars
would
you
like
a
new
master
morano
indeed
said
morano
a
good
master
is
better
to
some
men
minds
than
a
bad
one
yet
you
see
señor
my
bad
master
has
me
bound
never
to
leave
him
by
oaths
that
i
do
not
properly
understand
the
meaning
of
and
that
might
blast
me
in
any
world
were
i
to
forswear
them
he
hath
bound
me
by
san
sathanas
with
many
others
i
do
not
like
the
sound
of
that
san
sathanas
and
so
you
see
señor
my
bad
master
suits
me
better
than
perhaps
to
be
whithered
in
this
world
by
a
and
in
the
next
world
who
knows
morano
said
rodriguez
there
is
a
dead
spider
on
my
bed
a
dead
spider
master
said
morano
with
as
much
concern
in
his
voice
as
though
no
spider
had
ever
sullied
that
chamber
before
yes
said
rodriguez
i
shall
require
you
to
keep
my
bed
tidy
on
our
way
to
the
wars
master
said
morano
no
spider
shall
come
near
it
living
or
dead
and
so
our
company
of
one
going
northward
through
spain
looking
for
romance
became
a
company
of
two
master
said
morano
as
i
do
not
see
him
whom
i
serve
and
his
ways
are
early
ways
i
fear
some
evil
has
overtaken
him
whereby
we
shall
be
suspect
for
none
other
dwells
here
and
he
is
under
special
protection
of
the
garda
civil
it
would
be
well
therefore
to
start
for
the
wars
right
early
the
guard
protect
mine
host
then
rodriguez
said
with
as
much
surprise
in
his
tones
as
he
ever
permitted
himself
master
morano
said
it
could
not
be
otherwise
for
so
many
gallants
have
entered
the
door
of
this
inn
and
supped
in
this
chamber
and
never
been
seen
again
and
so
many
suspicious
things
have
been
found
here
such
as
blood
that
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
pay
the
guard
well
and
so
they
protect
him
and
morano
hastily
slung
over
his
shoulder
by
leather
straps
an
iron
pot
and
a
and
took
his
broad
felt
hat
from
a
peg
on
the
wall
rodriguez
eyes
looked
so
curiously
at
the
great
cooking
utensils
dangling
there
from
the
straps
that
morano
perceived
his
young
master
did
not
fully
understand
these
preparations
he
therefore
instructed
him
thus
master
there
be
two
things
necessary
in
the
wars
strategy
and
cooking
now
the
first
of
these
comes
in
use
when
the
captains
speak
of
their
achievements
and
the
historians
write
of
the
wars
strategy
is
a
learned
thing
master
and
the
wars
may
not
be
told
of
without
it
but
while
the
war
rageth
and
men
be
camped
upon
the
foughten
field
then
is
the
time
for
cooking
for
many
a
man
that
fights
the
wars
if
he
hath
not
his
food
were
well
content
to
let
the
enemy
live
but
feed
him
and
at
once
he
becometh
proud
at
heart
and
can
not
the
sight
of
the
enemy
walking
among
his
tents
but
must
needs
slay
him
outright
aye
master
the
cooking
for
the
wars
and
when
the
wars
are
over
you
who
are
learned
shall
study
strategy
and
rodriguez
perceived
that
there
was
wisdom
in
the
world
that
was
not
taught
in
the
college
of
san
josephus
near
to
his
father
valleys
where
he
had
learned
in
his
youth
the
ways
of
books
morano
he
said
let
us
now
leave
mine
host
to
entertain
la
garda
and
at
the
mention
of
the
guard
hurry
came
on
morano
he
closed
his
lips
upon
his
store
of
wisdom
and
together
they
left
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
and
when
rodriguez
saw
shut
behind
him
that
dark
door
of
oak
that
he
had
so
persistently
entered
and
through
which
he
had
come
again
to
the
light
of
the
sun
by
many
precautions
and
some
luck
he
felt
gratitude
to
morano
for
had
it
not
been
for
sinister
hints
and
above
all
his
remark
that
mine
host
would
have
driven
him
thence
because
he
liked
him
the
evil
look
of
the
sombre
chamber
alone
might
not
have
been
enough
to
persuade
him
to
the
precautions
that
cut
short
the
dreadful
business
of
that
inn
and
with
his
gratitude
was
a
feeling
not
unlike
remorse
for
he
felt
that
he
had
deprived
this
poor
man
of
a
part
of
his
regular
wages
which
would
have
been
his
own
gold
ring
and
the
setting
that
held
the
sapphire
had
all
gone
well
with
the
business
so
he
slipped
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
gave
it
to
morano
sapphire
and
all
morano
expressions
of
gratitude
were
in
keeping
with
that
flowery
period
in
spain
and
might
appear
ridiculous
were
i
to
expose
them
to
the
eyes
of
an
age
in
which
one
in
morano
place
on
such
an
occasion
would
have
merely
said
damned
good
of
you
old
nut
not
half
and
let
the
matter
drop
i
merely
record
therefore
that
morano
was
grateful
and
so
expressed
himself
while
rodriguez
in
addition
to
the
pleasant
glow
in
the
mind
that
comes
from
a
generous
action
had
another
feeling
that
gives
all
of
us
pleasure
or
comfort
at
least
until
it
grows
monotonous
a
feeling
of
increased
safety
for
while
he
had
the
ring
upon
his
finger
and
morano
went
unpaid
the
thought
could
not
help
occurring
even
to
a
generous
mind
that
one
of
these
windy
nights
morano
might
come
for
his
wages
master
said
morano
looking
at
the
sapphire
now
on
his
own
little
finger
near
the
top
joint
the
only
stone
amongst
his
row
of
rings
you
must
surely
have
great
wealth
yes
said
rodriguez
slapping
the
scabbard
that
held
his
castilian
blade
and
when
he
saw
that
morano
eyes
were
staring
at
the
little
emeralds
that
were
dotted
along
the
velvet
of
the
scabbard
he
explained
that
it
was
the
sword
that
was
his
wealth
for
in
the
wars
he
said
are
all
things
to
be
won
and
nothing
is
unobtainable
to
the
sword
for
parchment
and
custom
govern
all
the
possessions
of
man
as
they
taught
me
in
the
college
of
san
josephus
yet
the
sword
is
at
first
the
founder
and
discoverer
of
all
possessions
and
this
my
father
told
me
before
he
gave
me
this
sword
which
hath
already
acquired
in
the
old
time
fair
castles
with
many
a
tower
and
those
that
dwelt
in
the
castles
master
before
the
sword
came
said
morano
they
died
and
went
dismally
to
hell
said
rodriguez
as
the
old
songs
say
they
walked
on
then
in
silence
morano
with
his
low
forehead
and
greater
girth
of
body
than
of
brain
to
the
superficial
observer
was
not
incapable
of
thought
however
slow
his
thoughts
may
have
come
morano
was
pondering
surely
suddenly
the
puckers
on
his
little
forehead
cleared
and
he
brightly
looked
at
rodriguez
as
they
went
on
side
by
side
master
morano
said
when
you
choose
a
castle
in
the
wars
let
it
above
all
things
be
one
of
those
that
is
easy
to
be
defended
for
castles
are
easily
got
as
the
old
songs
tell
and
in
the
heat
of
combat
positions
are
quickly
stormed
and
no
more
ado
but
when
wars
are
over
then
is
the
time
for
ease
and
languorous
days
and
the
imperilling
of
the
soul
though
not
beyond
the
point
where
our
good
fathers
may
save
it
nay
morano
rodriguez
said
no
man
as
they
taught
me
well
in
the
college
of
san
josephus
should
ever
imperil
his
soul
but
master
morano
said
a
man
imperils
his
body
in
the
wars
yet
hopes
by
dexterity
and
his
sword
to
draw
it
safely
thence
so
a
man
of
courage
and
high
heart
may
surely
imperil
his
soul
and
still
hope
to
bring
it
at
the
last
to
salvation
not
so
said
rodriguez
and
gave
his
mind
to
pondering
upon
the
exact
teaching
he
had
received
on
this
very
point
but
could
not
clearly
remember
so
they
walked
in
silence
rodriguez
thinking
still
of
this
spiritual
problem
morano
turning
though
with
infinite
slowness
to
another
thought
upon
a
lower
plane
and
after
a
while
rodriguez
eyes
turned
again
to
the
flowers
and
he
felt
his
meditation
as
youth
will
and
looking
abroad
he
saw
the
wonder
of
spring
calling
forth
the
beauty
of
spain
and
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
his
heart
rejoiced
with
the
anemones
as
hearts
at
his
age
do
but
morano
clung
to
his
thought
it
was
long
before
rodriguez
fanciful
thoughts
came
back
from
among
the
flowers
for
among
those
delicate
earliest
blooms
of
spring
his
youthful
visions
felt
they
were
with
familiars
so
they
tarried
neglecting
the
dusty
road
and
poor
gross
morano
but
when
his
fancies
left
the
flowers
at
last
and
looked
again
at
morano
rodriguez
perceived
that
his
servant
was
all
troubled
with
thought
so
he
left
morano
in
silence
for
his
thought
to
come
to
maturity
for
he
had
formed
a
liking
already
for
the
judgments
of
morano
simple
mind
they
walked
in
silence
for
the
space
of
an
hour
and
at
last
morano
spoke
it
was
then
noon
master
he
said
at
this
hour
it
is
the
custom
of
la
garda
to
enter
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
to
dine
at
the
expense
of
mine
host
a
merry
custom
said
rodriguez
master
said
morano
if
they
find
him
in
less
than
his
usual
health
they
will
get
their
dinners
for
themselves
in
the
larder
and
dine
and
afterwards
sleep
but
after
that
master
after
that
should
anything
inauspicious
have
befallen
mine
host
they
will
seek
out
and
ask
many
questions
concerning
all
travellers
too
many
for
our
liking
we
are
many
good
miles
from
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
said
rodriguez
master
when
they
have
eaten
and
slept
and
asked
questions
they
will
follow
on
horses
said
morano
we
can
hide
said
rodriguez
and
he
looked
round
over
the
plain
very
full
of
flowers
but
empty
and
bare
under
the
blue
sky
of
any
place
in
which
a
man
might
hide
to
escape
from
pursuers
on
horse
back
he
perceived
then
that
he
had
no
plan
master
said
morano
there
is
no
hiding
like
disguises
once
more
rodriguez
looked
round
him
over
the
plain
seeing
no
houses
no
men
and
his
opinion
of
morano
judgment
sank
when
he
said
disguises
but
then
morano
unfolded
to
him
that
plan
which
up
to
that
day
had
never
been
tried
before
so
far
as
records
tell
in
all
the
straits
in
which
fugitive
men
have
been
and
which
seems
from
my
researches
in
verse
and
prose
never
to
have
been
attempted
since
the
plan
was
this
astute
as
morano
and
simple
as
his
naive
mind
the
clothing
for
which
rodriguez
searched
the
plain
vainly
was
ready
to
hand
no
disguise
was
effective
against
la
garda
they
had
too
many
suspicions
their
skill
was
to
discover
disguises
but
in
the
moment
of
la
garda
triumph
when
they
had
found
out
the
disguise
when
success
had
lulled
the
suspicions
for
which
they
were
infamous
then
was
the
time
to
trick
la
garda
rodriguez
wondered
but
the
slow
mind
of
morano
was
sure
and
now
he
came
to
the
point
the
fruit
of
his
thinking
rodriguez
should
disguise
himself
as
morano
when
la
garda
discovered
that
he
was
not
the
man
he
appeared
to
be
a
study
to
which
they
devoted
their
lives
their
suspicions
would
rest
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
and
morano
should
disguise
himself
as
rodriguez
it
was
a
new
idea
had
rodriguez
been
twice
his
age
he
would
have
discarded
it
at
once
for
age
is
guided
by
precedent
which
when
pursued
is
a
dangerous
guide
indeed
even
as
it
was
he
was
critical
for
the
novelty
of
the
thing
coming
thus
from
his
gross
servant
surprised
him
as
much
as
though
morano
had
uttered
poetry
of
his
own
when
he
sang
as
he
sometimes
did
certain
merry
lascivious
songs
of
spain
that
any
one
of
the
last
few
centuries
knew
as
well
as
any
of
the
others
and
would
not
la
garda
find
out
that
he
was
himself
rodriguez
asked
as
quickly
as
they
found
out
he
was
not
morano
that
said
morano
is
not
the
way
of
la
garda
for
once
let
la
garda
come
by
a
suspicion
such
as
that
you
master
are
but
morano
and
they
will
cling
to
it
even
to
the
last
and
not
abandon
it
until
they
needs
must
and
then
throw
it
away
as
it
were
in
disgust
and
ride
hence
at
once
for
they
like
not
tarrying
long
near
one
who
has
seen
them
mistaken
they
will
soon
then
come
by
another
suspicion
said
rodriguez
not
so
master
answered
morano
for
those
that
are
as
suspicious
as
la
garda
change
their
suspicions
but
slowly
a
suspicion
is
an
old
song
to
them
then
said
rodriguez
i
shall
be
hard
set
ever
to
show
that
i
am
not
you
if
they
ever
suspect
i
am
it
will
be
hard
master
morano
answered
but
we
shall
do
it
for
we
shall
have
truth
upon
our
side
how
shall
we
disguise
ourselves
said
rodriguez
master
said
morano
when
you
came
to
our
town
none
knew
you
and
all
marked
your
clothes
as
for
me
my
fat
body
is
better
known
than
my
clothes
yet
am
i
not
too
well
known
by
la
garda
for
being
an
honest
man
whenever
la
garda
came
i
used
to
hide
you
did
well
said
rodriguez
certainly
i
did
well
said
morano
for
had
they
seen
me
they
might
on
account
of
certain
matters
have
taken
me
to
prison
and
prison
is
no
place
for
an
honest
man
let
us
disguise
ourselves
said
rodriguez
master
answered
morano
the
brain
is
greater
than
the
stomach
and
now
more
than
at
any
time
we
need
the
counsel
of
the
brain
let
us
therefore
appease
the
clamours
of
the
stomach
that
it
be
silent
and
he
drew
out
from
amongst
his
clothing
a
piece
of
sacking
in
which
was
a
mass
of
bacon
and
some
lard
and
unslung
his
huge
rodriguez
had
entirely
forgotten
the
need
of
food
but
now
the
memory
of
it
had
rushed
upon
him
like
a
flood
over
a
barrier
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
bacon
and
when
they
had
collected
enough
of
tiny
inflammable
things
for
it
was
a
treeless
plain
and
morano
had
made
a
fire
and
the
odour
of
the
bacon
became
perceptible
this
memory
was
hugely
intensified
let
us
eat
while
they
eat
master
said
morano
and
plan
while
they
sleep
and
disguise
ourselves
while
they
pursue
and
this
they
did
for
after
they
had
eaten
they
dug
up
earth
and
gathered
leaves
with
which
to
fill
the
gaps
in
morano
garments
when
they
should
hang
on
rodriguez
they
plucked
a
geranium
with
whose
dye
they
deepened
rodriguez
complexion
and
with
the
sap
from
the
stalk
of
a
weed
morano
toned
to
a
pallor
the
ruddy
brown
of
his
tough
cheeks
then
they
changed
clothes
altogether
which
made
morano
gasp
and
after
that
nothing
remained
but
to
cut
off
the
delicate
black
moustachios
of
rodriguez
and
to
stick
them
to
the
face
of
morano
with
the
juice
of
another
flower
that
he
knew
where
to
find
rodriguez
sighed
when
he
saw
them
go
he
had
pictured
ecstatic
glances
cast
some
day
at
those
moustachios
glances
from
under
long
eyelashes
twinkling
at
evening
from
balconies
and
looking
at
them
where
they
were
now
he
felt
that
this
was
impossible
for
one
moment
morano
raised
his
head
with
an
air
as
it
were
preening
himself
when
the
new
moustachios
had
stuck
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
or
felt
his
master
sorrow
at
their
loss
he
immediately
hung
his
head
showing
nothing
but
shame
for
the
loss
he
had
caused
his
master
or
for
the
impropriety
of
those
delicate
growths
that
so
ill
become
his
jowl
and
now
they
took
the
road
again
rodriguez
with
the
great
and
no
longer
together
but
not
too
far
apart
for
la
garda
to
take
them
both
at
once
and
to
make
the
doubly
false
charge
that
should
so
confound
their
errand
and
morano
wore
that
old
triumphant
sword
and
carried
the
mandolin
that
was
ever
young
they
had
not
gone
far
when
it
was
as
morano
had
said
for
looking
back
as
they
often
did
to
the
spot
where
their
road
touched
the
they
saw
la
garda
spurring
seven
of
them
in
their
unmistakable
looped
hats
very
clear
against
the
sky
which
a
moment
ago
seemed
so
fair
when
the
seven
saw
the
two
they
did
not
spare
the
dust
and
first
they
came
to
morano
you
they
said
are
rodriguez
trinidad
fernandez
concepcion
henrique
maria
a
lord
of
the
valleys
of
arguento
harez
no
masters
said
morano
oh
but
denials
were
lost
upon
la
garda
denials
inflamed
their
suspicions
as
no
other
evidence
could
many
a
man
had
they
seen
with
his
throat
in
the
hands
of
the
public
garrotter
and
all
had
begun
with
denials
who
ended
thus
they
looked
at
the
mandolin
at
the
gay
cloak
at
the
emeralds
in
the
scabbard
for
wherever
emeralds
go
there
is
evidence
to
identify
them
until
the
nature
of
man
changes
or
the
price
of
emeralds
they
spoke
hastily
among
themselves
without
doubt
said
one
of
them
you
are
whom
we
said
and
they
arrested
morano
then
they
spurred
on
to
rodriguez
you
are
they
said
as
no
man
doubts
one
morano
servant
at
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
whose
good
master
is
as
we
allege
dead
masters
answered
rodriguez
i
am
but
a
poor
traveller
and
no
servant
at
any
inn
now
la
garda
as
i
have
indicated
will
hear
all
things
except
denials
and
thus
to
receive
two
within
the
space
of
two
moments
infuriated
them
so
fiercely
that
they
were
incapable
of
forming
any
other
theory
that
day
except
the
one
they
held
there
are
many
men
like
this
they
can
form
a
plausible
theory
and
grasp
its
logical
points
but
take
it
away
from
them
and
destroy
it
utterly
before
their
eyes
and
they
will
not
so
easily
lash
their
tired
brains
at
once
to
build
another
theory
in
place
of
the
one
that
is
ruined
as
the
saints
live
they
said
you
are
morano
and
they
arrested
rodriguez
too
now
when
they
began
to
turn
back
by
the
way
they
had
come
rodriguez
began
to
fear
overmuch
identification
so
he
assured
la
garda
that
in
the
next
village
ahead
of
them
were
those
who
would
answer
all
questions
concerning
him
as
well
as
being
the
possessors
of
the
finest
vintage
of
wine
in
the
kingdom
of
spain
now
it
may
be
that
the
mention
of
this
wine
soothed
the
anger
caused
in
the
men
of
la
garda
by
two
denials
or
it
may
be
that
curiosity
guided
them
at
any
rate
they
took
the
road
that
led
away
from
last
sinister
shelter
rodriguez
and
five
of
la
garda
two
of
them
stayed
behind
with
morano
undecided
as
yet
which
way
to
take
though
looking
wistfully
the
way
that
that
wine
was
said
to
be
and
rodriguez
left
morano
to
his
own
devices
in
which
he
trusted
profoundly
now
rodriguez
knew
not
the
name
of
the
next
village
that
they
would
come
to
nor
the
names
of
any
of
the
dwellers
in
it
yet
he
had
a
plan
as
he
went
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
horses
he
questioned
the
rider
can
morano
write
he
said
la
garda
laughed
can
morano
talk
latin
he
said
la
garda
crossed
themselves
all
five
men
and
after
some
while
of
riding
and
hard
walking
for
rodriguez
to
whom
they
allowed
a
hand
on
a
stirrup
leather
there
came
in
sight
the
tops
of
the
brown
roofs
of
a
village
over
a
fold
of
the
plain
is
this
your
village
said
one
of
his
captors
surely
answered
rodriguez
what
is
its
name
said
one
it
has
many
names
said
rodriguez
and
then
another
one
of
them
recognised
it
from
the
shape
of
its
roofs
it
is
saint
he
said
aye
so
strangers
call
it
said
rodriguez
and
where
the
road
turned
round
that
fold
of
the
plain
lolling
a
little
to
its
left
in
the
idle
spanish
air
they
came
upon
the
village
all
in
view
i
do
not
know
how
to
describe
this
village
to
you
my
reader
for
the
words
that
mean
to
you
what
it
was
are
all
the
wrong
words
to
use
antique
quaint
seem
words
with
which
to
tell
of
it
yet
it
had
no
antiquity
denied
to
the
other
villages
it
had
been
brought
to
birth
like
them
by
the
passing
of
time
and
was
nursed
like
them
in
the
lap
of
plains
or
valleys
of
spain
nor
was
it
quainter
than
any
of
its
neighbours
though
it
was
like
itself
alone
as
they
had
their
characters
also
and
though
no
village
in
the
world
was
like
it
it
differed
only
from
the
next
as
sister
differs
from
sister
to
those
that
dwelt
in
it
it
was
wholly
apart
from
all
the
world
of
man
most
of
its
tall
white
houses
with
green
doors
were
gathered
about
the
in
which
were
pigeons
and
smells
and
declining
sunlight
as
rodriguez
and
his
escort
came
towards
it
and
from
round
a
corner
at
the
back
of
it
the
short
repeated
song
of
one
who
would
sell
a
commodity
went
up
piercingly
this
was
all
very
long
ago
time
has
wrecked
that
village
now
centuries
have
flowed
over
it
some
stormily
some
smoothly
but
so
many
that
of
the
village
rodriguez
saw
there
can
be
now
no
more
than
wreckage
for
all
i
know
a
village
of
that
name
may
stand
on
that
same
plain
but
the
saint
that
rodriguez
knew
is
gone
like
youth
queerly
tiled
sheltered
by
small
dense
trees
and
standing
a
little
apart
rodriguez
recognised
the
house
of
the
priest
he
recognised
it
by
a
certain
air
it
had
thither
he
pointed
and
la
garda
rode
again
he
spoke
to
them
can
morano
speak
latin
he
said
god
forbid
said
la
garda
they
dismounted
and
opened
a
gate
that
was
gilded
all
over
in
a
low
wall
of
round
boulders
they
went
up
a
narrow
path
between
thick
ilices
and
came
to
the
green
door
they
pulled
a
bell
whose
handle
was
a
symbol
carved
in
copper
one
of
the
priest
mysteries
the
bell
boomed
through
the
house
a
tiny
musical
boom
and
the
priest
opened
the
door
and
rodriguez
addressed
him
in
latin
and
the
priest
answered
him
at
first
la
garda
had
not
realised
what
had
happened
and
then
the
priest
beckoned
and
they
all
entered
his
house
for
rodriguez
had
asked
him
for
ink
into
a
room
they
came
where
a
silver
was
and
the
grey
plume
of
the
goose
picture
no
such
my
reader
as
they
sell
in
shops
the
silver
no
thicker
than
paper
and
perhaps
a
pattern
all
over
it
guaranteed
artistic
it
was
molten
silver
well
wrought
and
hollowed
for
ink
and
in
the
hollow
there
was
the
magical
fluid
the
stuff
that
rules
the
world
and
hinders
time
that
in
which
flows
the
will
of
a
king
to
establish
his
laws
for
ever
that
which
gives
valleys
unto
new
possessors
that
whereby
towers
are
held
by
their
lawful
owners
that
which
used
grimly
by
the
king
judge
is
death
that
which
when
poets
play
is
mirth
for
ever
and
ever
no
wonder
la
garda
looked
at
it
in
awe
no
wonder
they
crossed
themselves
again
and
then
rodriguez
wrote
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
jaws
of
la
garda
dropped
while
the
old
priest
slightly
smiled
for
he
somewhat
divined
the
situation
already
and
being
the
people
friend
he
loved
not
la
garda
more
than
he
was
bound
by
the
rules
of
his
duty
to
man
then
one
of
la
garda
spoke
bringing
back
his
confidence
with
a
bluster
morano
has
sold
his
soul
to
satan
he
said
in
exchange
for
satan
aid
and
satan
has
taught
his
tongue
latin
and
guides
his
fingers
in
the
affairs
of
the
pen
and
so
said
all
la
garda
rejoicing
at
finding
an
explanation
where
a
moment
ago
there
was
none
as
all
men
at
such
times
do
little
it
matters
what
the
explanation
be
does
a
man
in
sahara
who
finds
water
suddenly
inquire
with
precision
what
its
qualities
are
and
then
the
priest
said
a
word
and
made
a
sign
against
which
satan
himself
can
only
prevail
with
difficulty
and
in
presence
of
which
his
spells
can
never
endure
and
after
this
rodriguez
wrote
again
then
were
la
garda
silent
and
at
length
the
leader
said
and
he
called
on
them
all
to
testify
that
he
had
made
no
charge
whatever
against
this
traveller
moreover
they
had
escorted
him
on
his
way
out
of
respect
for
him
because
the
roads
were
dangerous
and
must
now
depart
because
they
had
higher
duties
so
la
garda
departed
looking
before
them
with
stern
preoccupied
faces
and
urging
their
horses
on
as
men
who
go
on
an
errand
of
great
urgency
and
rodriguez
having
thanked
them
for
their
protection
upon
the
road
turned
back
into
the
house
and
the
two
sat
down
together
and
rodriguez
told
his
rescuer
the
story
of
the
hospitality
of
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
not
as
confession
he
told
it
but
as
a
pleasant
tale
for
he
looked
on
the
swift
demise
of
la
garda
friend
in
the
night
in
the
spidery
room
as
a
fair
blessing
for
spain
a
thing
most
suited
to
the
sweet
days
of
spring
the
spiritual
man
rejoiced
to
hear
such
a
tale
as
do
all
men
of
peace
to
hear
talk
of
violent
deeds
in
which
they
may
not
share
and
when
the
tale
was
ended
he
reproved
rodriguez
exceedingly
explaining
to
him
the
nature
of
the
sin
of
blood
and
telling
him
that
absolution
could
be
come
by
now
though
hardly
but
how
on
some
future
occasion
there
might
be
none
to
be
had
and
rodriguez
listened
with
all
the
gravity
of
expression
that
youth
knows
well
how
to
wear
while
its
thoughts
are
nimbly
dancing
far
away
in
fair
fields
of
adventure
or
love
and
darkness
came
down
and
lamps
were
carried
in
and
the
reverend
father
asked
rodriguez
in
what
other
affairs
of
violence
his
sword
had
unhappily
been
and
rodriguez
knew
well
the
history
of
that
sword
having
gathered
all
that
concerned
it
out
of
spoken
legend
or
song
and
although
the
reverend
man
frowned
minatorily
whenever
he
heard
of
its
passings
through
the
ribs
of
the
faithful
and
nodded
as
though
his
head
gave
benediction
when
he
heard
of
the
destruction
of
god
most
vile
enemy
the
infidel
and
though
he
gasped
a
little
through
his
lips
when
he
heard
of
certain
tarryings
of
that
sword
in
scented
gardens
while
christian
knights
should
sleep
and
their
swords
hang
on
the
wall
though
sometimes
even
a
little
he
raised
his
hands
yet
he
leaned
forward
always
listening
well
and
picturing
clearly
as
though
his
gleaming
eyes
could
see
them
each
doleful
tale
of
violence
or
sin
and
so
night
came
and
began
to
wear
away
and
neither
knew
how
late
the
hour
was
and
then
as
rodriguez
spoke
of
an
evening
in
a
garden
of
which
some
old
song
told
well
a
night
in
early
summer
under
the
evening
star
and
that
sword
there
as
always
as
he
told
of
his
grandfather
as
poets
had
loved
to
tell
going
among
the
scents
of
the
huge
flowers
familiar
with
the
dark
garden
as
the
moths
that
drifted
by
him
as
he
spoke
of
a
sigh
heard
faintly
as
he
spoke
of
danger
near
whether
to
body
or
soul
as
the
reverend
father
was
about
to
raise
both
his
hands
there
came
a
thunder
of
knockings
upon
the
locked
green
door
the
third
chronicle
how
he
came
to
the
house
of
wonder
it
was
the
gross
morano
here
he
had
tracked
rodriguez
for
where
la
garda
goes
is
always
known
and
rumour
of
it
remains
long
behind
them
like
the
scent
of
a
fox
he
told
no
tale
of
his
escape
more
than
a
dog
does
who
comes
home
some
hours
late
a
dog
comes
back
to
his
master
that
is
all
panting
a
little
perhaps
someone
perhaps
had
caught
him
and
he
escaped
and
came
home
a
thing
too
natural
to
attempt
to
speak
of
by
any
of
the
signs
that
a
dog
knows
part
of
morano
method
seems
to
have
resembled
rodriguez
for
just
as
rodriguez
spoke
latin
so
morano
fell
back
upon
his
own
natural
speech
that
he
as
it
were
unbridled
and
allowed
to
run
free
the
coarseness
of
which
had
at
first
astounded
and
then
delighted
la
garda
and
did
they
not
suspect
that
you
were
yourself
said
rodriguez
no
master
morano
answered
for
i
said
that
i
was
the
brother
of
the
king
of
aragon
the
king
of
aragon
rodriguez
said
going
to
the
length
of
showing
surprise
yes
indeed
master
said
morano
and
they
recognised
me
recognised
you
exclaimed
the
priest
indeed
so
said
morano
for
they
said
that
they
were
themselves
the
kings
of
aragon
and
so
father
they
recognised
me
for
their
brother
that
you
should
not
have
said
the
priest
told
morano
reverend
father
replied
morano
as
heaven
shines
i
believed
that
what
i
said
was
true
and
morano
sighed
deeply
and
now
he
said
i
know
it
is
true
no
more
whether
he
sighed
for
the
loss
of
his
belief
in
that
exalted
relationship
or
whether
for
the
loss
of
that
state
of
mind
in
which
such
beliefs
come
easily
there
was
nothing
in
his
sigh
to
show
they
questioned
him
further
but
he
said
no
more
he
was
here
there
was
no
more
to
say
he
was
here
and
la
garda
was
gone
and
then
the
reverend
man
brought
for
them
a
great
supper
even
at
that
late
hour
for
many
an
hour
had
slipped
softly
by
as
he
heard
the
sins
of
the
sword
and
wine
he
set
out
too
of
a
certain
golden
vintage
long
lost
i
fear
my
reader
but
this
he
gave
not
to
morano
lest
he
should
be
once
more
what
the
reverend
father
feared
to
entertain
that
dread
hidalgo
the
king
of
aragon
brother
and
after
that
the
stars
having
then
gone
far
on
their
ways
the
old
priest
rose
and
offered
a
bed
to
rodriguez
and
even
as
he
eyed
morano
wondering
where
to
put
him
and
was
about
to
speak
for
he
had
no
other
bed
morano
went
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
curled
up
and
lay
down
and
by
the
time
his
host
had
walked
over
to
him
and
spoken
asking
anxiously
if
he
needed
nothing
more
he
was
almost
already
asleep
and
muttered
in
answer
after
having
been
spoken
to
twice
no
more
than
straw
reverend
father
straw
an
armful
of
this
the
good
man
brought
him
and
then
showed
rodriguez
to
his
room
and
they
can
scarcely
have
reached
it
before
morano
was
back
in
aragon
again
walking
on
golden
shoes
which
were
sometimes
wings
proud
among
lesser
princes
as
precaution
for
the
night
rodriguez
took
one
more
glance
at
his
host
kind
face
and
then
with
sword
out
of
reach
and
an
unlocked
door
he
slept
till
the
songs
of
birds
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
ilices
made
sleep
any
longer
impossible
the
third
morning
of
rodriguez
wandering
blazed
over
spain
like
brass
flowers
and
grass
and
sky
were
twinkling
all
together
when
rodriguez
greeted
his
host
morano
was
long
astir
having
awakened
with
dawn
for
the
simpler
and
humbler
the
creature
the
nearer
it
is
akin
to
the
earth
and
the
sun
the
forces
that
woke
the
birds
and
opened
the
flowers
stirred
the
gross
lump
of
morano
ending
his
sleep
as
they
ended
the
nightingale
song
they
breakfasted
hurriedly
and
rodriguez
rose
to
depart
feeling
that
he
had
taken
hospitality
that
had
not
been
offered
but
against
his
departure
was
the
barrier
of
all
the
politeness
of
spain
the
house
was
his
said
his
host
and
even
the
small
grove
of
ilices
if
i
told
you
half
of
the
things
that
the
reverend
man
said
you
would
say
this
writer
is
affected
i
do
not
like
all
this
flowery
mush
i
think
it
safer
my
reader
not
to
tell
you
any
of
it
let
us
suppose
that
he
merely
said
quite
all
right
and
that
when
rodriguez
thanked
him
on
one
knee
he
answered
not
at
all
and
that
so
rodriguez
and
morano
left
if
here
it
miss
some
flash
of
the
fair
form
of
truth
it
is
the
fault
of
the
age
i
write
for
the
road
again
dust
again
birds
and
the
blaze
of
leaves
these
were
the
background
of
my
wanderers
until
the
eye
had
gone
as
far
as
the
eye
can
roam
and
there
were
the
tips
of
some
far
mountains
that
now
came
into
view
they
were
still
in
each
other
clothes
but
the
village
was
not
behind
them
very
far
when
morano
explained
for
he
knew
the
ways
of
la
garda
that
having
arrested
two
men
upon
this
road
they
would
now
arrest
two
men
each
on
all
the
other
roads
in
order
to
show
the
impartiality
of
the
law
which
constantly
needs
to
be
exhibited
and
that
therefore
all
men
were
safe
on
the
road
they
were
on
for
a
long
while
to
come
now
there
seemed
to
rodriguez
to
be
much
good
sense
in
what
morano
had
said
and
so
indeed
there
was
for
they
had
good
laws
in
spain
and
they
differed
little
though
so
long
ago
from
our
own
excellent
system
therefore
they
changed
once
more
giving
back
to
each
other
everything
but
alas
those
delicate
black
moustachios
and
these
to
rodriguez
seemed
gone
for
ever
for
the
growth
of
new
ones
seemed
so
far
ahead
to
the
long
days
of
youth
that
his
hopes
could
scarce
reach
to
them
when
morano
found
himself
once
more
in
those
clothes
that
had
been
with
him
night
and
day
for
so
many
years
he
seemed
to
expand
i
mean
no
metaphor
here
he
grew
visibly
fatter
ah
said
morano
after
a
huge
breath
last
night
i
dreamed
in
your
illustrious
clothes
that
i
was
in
lofty
station
and
now
master
i
am
comfortable
which
were
best
think
you
said
rodriguez
if
you
could
have
but
one
a
lofty
place
or
comfort
even
in
those
days
such
a
question
was
trite
but
rodriguez
uttered
it
only
thinking
to
dip
in
the
store
of
morano
simple
wisdom
as
one
may
throw
a
mere
worm
to
catch
a
worthy
fish
but
in
this
he
was
disappointed
for
morano
made
no
neat
comparison
nor
even
gave
an
opinion
saying
only
master
while
i
have
comfort
how
shall
i
judge
the
case
of
any
who
have
not
and
no
more
would
he
say
his
new
found
comfort
lost
for
a
day
and
night
seemed
so
to
have
soothed
his
body
that
it
closed
the
gates
of
the
mind
as
too
much
luxury
may
even
with
poets
and
now
rodriguez
thought
of
his
quest
again
and
the
two
of
them
pushed
on
briskly
to
find
the
wars
for
an
hour
they
walked
in
silence
an
empty
road
and
then
they
came
upon
a
row
of
donkeys
piled
high
with
the
bark
of
the
that
men
were
bringing
slowly
from
far
woods
some
of
the
men
were
singing
as
they
went
they
passed
slow
in
the
sunshine
oh
master
said
morano
when
they
were
gone
i
like
not
that
lascivious
loitering
why
morano
said
rodriguez
it
was
not
god
that
made
hurry
master
answered
morano
i
know
well
who
made
hurry
and
may
he
not
overtake
my
soul
at
the
last
yet
it
is
bad
for
our
fortunes
that
these
men
should
loiter
thus
you
want
your
castle
master
and
i
i
want
not
always
to
wander
roads
with
la
garda
perhaps
behind
and
no
certain
place
to
curl
up
and
sleep
in
front
i
look
for
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
cellar
of
your
great
castle
yes
yes
you
shall
have
it
his
master
said
but
how
do
these
folks
hinder
you
for
morano
was
scowling
at
them
over
his
shoulder
in
a
way
that
was
somehow
spoiling
the
gladness
of
spring
the
air
is
full
of
their
singing
morano
said
it
is
as
though
their
souls
were
already
flying
to
hell
and
cawing
hoarse
with
sin
all
the
way
as
they
go
and
they
loiter
and
they
linger
oh
but
morano
was
angry
but
said
rodriguez
how
does
their
lingering
harm
you
where
are
the
wars
master
where
are
the
wars
blurted
morano
his
round
face
turning
redder
the
donkeys
would
be
dead
the
men
would
be
running
there
would
be
shouts
cries
and
confusion
if
the
wars
were
anywhere
near
there
would
be
all
things
but
this
the
men
strolled
on
singing
and
so
passed
slow
into
distance
morano
was
right
though
i
know
not
how
he
knew
and
now
the
men
and
the
donkeys
were
nearly
out
of
sight
but
had
not
yet
at
all
emerged
from
the
wrath
of
morano
lascivious
knaves
muttered
that
disappointed
man
and
whenever
he
faintly
heard
dim
snatches
of
their
far
song
that
a
breeze
here
and
another
there
brought
over
the
plain
as
it
ran
on
the
errands
of
spring
he
cursed
their
sins
under
his
breath
though
it
seemed
not
so
much
their
sins
that
moved
his
wrath
as
the
leisure
they
had
for
committing
them
peace
peace
morano
said
rodriguez
it
is
that
said
morano
that
is
troubling
me
what
this
same
peace
morano
said
rodriguez
i
had
when
young
to
study
the
affairs
of
men
and
this
is
put
into
books
and
so
they
make
history
now
i
learned
that
there
is
no
thing
in
which
men
have
taken
delight
that
is
ever
put
away
from
them
for
it
seems
that
time
which
altereth
every
custom
hath
altered
none
of
our
likings
and
in
every
chapter
they
taught
me
there
were
these
wars
to
be
found
master
the
times
are
altered
said
morano
sadly
it
is
not
now
as
in
old
days
and
this
was
not
the
wisdom
of
morano
for
anger
had
clouded
his
judgment
and
a
faint
song
came
yet
from
the
wavering
over
the
flowers
master
morano
said
there
are
men
like
those
vile
who
have
taken
delight
in
peace
it
may
be
that
peace
has
been
brought
upon
the
world
by
one
of
these
lousy
likings
the
delight
of
peace
said
rodriguez
is
in
its
contrast
to
war
if
war
were
banished
this
delight
were
gone
and
man
lost
none
of
his
delights
in
any
chapter
i
read
the
word
and
the
meaning
of
contrast
were
such
as
is
understood
by
reflective
minds
the
product
of
education
morano
felt
rather
than
reflected
and
the
word
contrast
meant
nothing
to
him
this
ended
their
conversation
and
the
songs
of
the
light
though
they
were
being
too
heavy
to
be
carried
farther
by
the
idle
air
of
spring
morano
ceased
cursing
their
sins
and
now
the
mountains
rose
up
taller
seeming
to
stretch
themselves
and
raise
their
heads
in
a
while
they
seemed
to
be
peering
over
the
plain
they
that
were
as
pale
ghosts
far
off
dim
like
fate
in
the
early
part
of
the
morning
now
appeared
darker
more
furrowed
more
sinister
more
careworn
more
immediately
concerned
with
the
affairs
of
earth
and
so
more
menacing
to
earthly
things
still
they
went
on
and
still
the
mountains
grew
and
noon
came
when
spain
sleeps
and
now
the
plain
was
altering
as
though
cool
winds
from
the
mountains
brought
other
growths
to
birth
so
that
they
met
with
bushes
straggling
wild
free
careless
and
mysterious
as
they
do
where
there
is
none
to
teach
great
nature
how
to
be
tidy
the
wanderers
chose
a
clump
of
these
that
were
gathered
near
the
way
like
gypsies
camped
awhile
midway
on
a
wonderful
journey
who
at
dawn
will
rise
and
go
leaving
but
a
bare
trace
of
their
resting
and
no
guess
of
their
destiny
so
so
free
so
phantasmal
those
dark
shrubs
seemed
morano
lay
down
on
the
very
edge
of
the
shade
of
one
and
rodriguez
lay
fair
in
the
midst
of
the
shade
of
another
whereby
anyone
passing
that
way
would
have
known
which
was
the
older
traveller
morano
according
to
his
custom
was
asleep
almost
immediately
but
rodriguez
with
wonder
and
speculation
each
toying
with
novelty
and
pulling
it
different
ways
between
them
stayed
awhile
wakeful
then
he
too
slept
and
a
bird
thought
it
safe
to
return
to
an
azalea
of
its
own
which
it
lately
fled
from
troubled
by
the
arrival
of
these
two
and
rodriguez
the
last
to
sleep
was
the
first
awake
for
the
shade
of
the
shrub
left
him
and
he
awoke
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
to
see
morano
still
sheltered
well
in
the
middle
now
of
the
shadow
he
chose
the
gross
sleep
of
morano
i
will
not
describe
to
you
reader
i
have
chosen
a
pleasant
tale
for
you
in
a
happy
land
in
the
fairest
time
of
year
in
a
golden
age
i
have
youth
to
show
you
and
an
ancient
sword
birds
flowers
and
sunlight
in
a
plain
unharmed
by
any
dream
of
commerce
why
should
i
show
you
the
sleep
of
that
inelegant
man
whose
bulk
lay
cumbering
the
earth
like
a
low
unseemly
mountain
rodriguez
overtook
the
shade
he
had
lost
and
lay
there
resting
until
morano
awoke
driven
all
at
once
from
sleep
by
a
dream
or
by
mere
choking
then
from
the
intricacies
of
his
clothing
which
to
him
after
those
two
days
was
what
home
is
to
some
far
wanderer
morano
drew
out
once
more
a
lump
of
bacon
then
came
the
and
then
a
fire
it
was
the
wanderers
mess
that
has
stood
in
many
lands
and
has
only
one
roof
we
are
proud
of
that
roof
all
we
who
belong
to
that
mess
we
boast
of
it
when
we
show
it
to
our
friends
when
it
is
all
set
out
at
night
it
has
aldebaran
in
it
the
bear
and
orion
and
at
the
other
end
the
southern
cross
yes
we
are
proud
of
our
roof
when
it
is
at
its
best
what
am
i
saying
i
should
be
talking
of
bacon
yes
but
there
is
a
way
of
cooking
it
in
our
mess
that
i
want
to
tell
you
and
can
not
tasted
bacon
there
that
is
the
same
as
what
you
get
at
the
ritz
and
i
want
to
tell
you
how
that
bacon
tastes
and
i
ca
so
i
talk
about
stars
but
perhaps
you
are
one
of
us
reader
and
then
you
will
understand
only
why
the
hell
do
we
get
back
there
again
where
the
evening
star
swings
low
on
the
wall
of
the
mess
when
they
rose
from
table
when
they
got
up
from
the
earth
and
the
was
slung
on
morano
back
adding
grease
to
the
mere
surface
of
his
coat
whose
texture
could
hold
no
more
they
pushed
on
briskly
for
they
saw
no
sign
of
houses
unless
what
rodriguez
saw
now
dimly
above
a
ravine
were
indeed
a
house
in
the
mountains
they
had
walked
from
eight
till
noon
without
any
loitering
they
must
have
done
fifteen
miles
since
the
mountains
were
pale
blue
and
now
every
mile
they
went
on
the
most
awful
of
the
dark
ridges
the
object
rodriguez
saw
seemed
more
and
more
like
a
house
yet
neither
then
nor
as
they
drew
still
nearer
nor
when
they
saw
it
close
nor
looking
back
on
it
after
years
did
it
somehow
seem
quite
right
and
morano
sometimes
crossed
himself
as
he
looked
at
it
and
said
nothing
rodriguez
as
they
walked
ceaselessly
through
the
afternoon
seeing
his
servant
show
some
sign
of
weariness
which
comes
not
to
youth
pointed
out
the
house
looking
nearer
than
it
really
was
on
the
mountain
and
told
him
that
he
should
find
there
straw
and
they
would
sup
and
stay
the
night
afterwards
when
the
strange
appearance
of
the
house
varying
with
different
angles
filled
him
with
curious
forebodings
rodriguez
would
make
no
admission
to
his
servant
but
held
to
the
plan
he
had
announced
and
so
approached
the
queer
roofs
neglecting
the
friendly
stars
through
the
afternoon
the
two
travellers
pushed
on
mostly
in
silence
for
the
glances
that
house
seemed
to
give
him
from
the
edge
of
its
perilous
ridge
had
driven
the
mirth
from
rodriguez
and
had
even
checked
the
garrulity
on
the
lips
of
the
tougher
morano
if
garrulity
can
be
ascribed
to
him
whose
words
seldom
welled
up
unless
some
simple
philosophy
troubled
his
deeps
the
house
seemed
indeed
to
glance
at
him
for
as
their
road
wound
on
the
house
showed
different
aspects
different
walls
and
edges
of
walls
and
different
curious
roofs
all
these
walls
seemed
to
peer
at
him
one
after
another
they
peered
new
ones
glided
imperceptibly
into
sight
as
though
to
say
we
see
too
the
mountains
were
not
before
them
but
a
little
to
the
right
of
their
path
until
new
ones
appeared
ahead
of
them
like
giants
arising
from
sleep
and
then
their
path
seemed
blocked
as
though
by
a
mighty
wall
against
which
its
feeble
wanderings
went
in
vain
in
the
end
it
turned
a
bit
to
its
right
and
went
straight
for
a
dark
mountain
where
a
wild
track
seemed
to
come
down
out
of
the
rocks
to
meet
it
and
upon
this
track
looked
down
that
sinister
house
had
you
been
there
my
reader
you
would
have
said
any
of
us
had
said
why
not
choose
some
other
house
there
were
no
other
houses
he
who
dwelt
on
the
edge
of
the
ravine
that
ran
into
that
dark
mountain
was
wholly
without
neighbours
and
evening
came
and
still
they
were
far
from
the
mountain
the
sun
set
on
their
left
but
it
was
in
the
eastern
sky
that
the
greater
splendour
was
for
the
low
rays
streaming
across
lit
up
some
stormy
clouds
that
were
brooding
behind
the
mountain
and
turned
their
gloomy
forms
to
an
astounding
purple
and
after
this
their
road
began
to
rise
toward
the
ridges
the
mountains
darkened
and
the
sinister
house
was
about
to
merge
with
their
shadows
when
he
who
dwelt
there
lit
candles
the
act
astonished
the
wayfarers
all
through
half
the
day
they
had
seen
the
house
until
it
seemed
part
of
the
mountains
evil
it
seemed
like
their
ridges
that
were
black
and
bleak
and
forbidding
and
strange
it
seemed
with
a
strangeness
that
moved
no
fears
they
could
name
yet
it
seemed
inactive
as
night
now
lights
appeared
showing
that
someone
moved
window
after
window
showed
to
the
bare
dark
mountain
its
gleaming
yellow
glare
there
in
the
night
the
house
forsook
the
dark
rocks
that
seemed
kin
to
it
by
glowing
as
they
could
never
glow
by
doing
what
the
beasts
that
haunted
them
could
not
do
this
was
the
lair
of
man
here
was
the
light
of
flame
but
the
rocks
remained
dark
and
cold
as
the
wind
of
night
that
went
over
them
he
who
dwelt
now
with
the
lights
had
forsaken
the
rocks
his
neighbours
and
when
all
were
lit
one
light
high
in
a
tower
shone
green
these
lights
appearing
out
of
the
mountain
thus
seemed
to
speak
to
rodriguez
and
to
tell
him
nothing
and
morano
wondered
as
he
seldom
troubled
to
do
they
pushed
on
up
the
steepening
path
like
you
the
looks
of
it
said
rodriguez
once
aye
master
answered
morano
so
there
be
straw
you
see
nothing
strange
there
then
rodriguez
said
master
morano
said
there
be
saints
for
all
requirements
any
fears
he
had
felt
about
that
house
before
now
as
he
neared
it
were
gone
it
was
time
to
put
away
fears
and
face
the
event
thus
worked
morano
philosophy
and
he
turned
his
thoughts
to
the
achievements
upon
earth
of
a
certain
saint
who
met
satan
and
showed
to
the
sovereign
of
hell
a
discourtesy
alien
to
the
ways
of
the
church
it
was
dark
now
and
the
yellow
lights
got
larger
as
they
drew
nearer
the
windows
till
they
saw
large
shadows
obscurely
passing
from
room
to
room
the
ascent
was
steep
now
and
the
pathway
stopped
no
track
of
any
kind
approached
the
house
it
stood
on
a
as
though
one
of
the
rocks
of
the
mountain
they
climbed
over
rocks
to
reach
it
the
windows
flickered
and
blinked
at
them
nothing
invited
them
there
in
the
look
of
that
house
but
they
were
now
in
such
a
forbidding
waste
that
shelter
had
to
be
found
they
were
all
among
edges
of
rock
as
black
as
the
night
and
hard
as
the
material
of
which
cosmos
was
formed
at
first
upon
chaos
brink
the
sound
of
their
climbing
ran
noisily
up
the
mountain
but
no
sound
came
from
the
house
only
the
shadows
moved
more
swiftly
across
a
room
passed
into
other
rooms
and
came
hurrying
back
sometimes
the
shadows
stayed
and
seemed
to
peer
and
when
the
travellers
stood
and
watched
to
see
what
they
were
they
would
disappear
and
there
were
no
shadows
at
all
and
the
rooms
were
filled
instead
with
their
wondering
speculation
then
they
pushed
on
over
rocks
that
seemed
never
trodden
by
man
so
sharp
were
they
and
slanting
all
piled
together
it
seemed
the
last
waste
to
which
all
shapeless
rocks
had
been
thrown
morano
and
these
black
rocks
seemed
shaped
by
a
different
scheme
indeed
the
rocks
had
never
been
shaped
at
all
they
were
just
raw
pieces
of
chaos
morano
climbed
over
their
edges
with
moans
and
discomfort
rodriguez
heard
him
behind
him
and
knew
by
his
moans
when
he
came
to
the
top
of
each
sharp
rock
the
rocks
became
savager
huger
even
more
sharp
and
more
angular
they
were
there
in
the
dark
in
multitudes
over
these
rodriguez
staggered
and
morano
clambered
and
tumbled
and
so
they
came
breathing
hard
to
the
lonely
house
in
the
wall
that
their
hands
had
reached
there
was
no
door
so
they
felt
along
it
till
they
came
to
the
corner
and
beyond
the
corner
was
the
front
wall
of
the
house
in
it
was
the
front
door
but
so
nearly
did
this
door
open
upon
the
abyss
that
the
bats
that
fled
from
their
coming
from
where
they
hung
above
the
door
of
oak
had
little
more
to
do
than
fall
from
their
crannies
slanting
ever
so
slightly
to
find
themselves
safe
from
man
in
the
velvet
darkness
that
lay
between
cliffs
so
lonely
they
were
almost
strangers
to
echo
and
here
they
floated
upon
errands
far
from
our
knowledge
while
the
travellers
coming
along
the
rocky
ledge
between
destruction
and
shelter
knocked
on
the
oaken
door
the
sound
of
their
knocking
boomed
huge
and
slow
through
the
house
as
though
they
had
struck
the
door
of
the
very
mountain
and
no
one
came
and
then
rodriguez
saw
dimly
in
the
darkness
the
great
handle
of
a
bell
carved
like
a
dragon
running
down
the
wall
he
pulled
it
and
a
cry
of
pain
arose
from
the
basement
of
the
house
even
morano
wondered
it
was
like
a
terrible
spirit
in
distress
it
was
long
before
rodriguez
dare
touch
the
handle
again
could
it
have
been
the
bell
he
felt
the
iron
handle
and
the
iron
chain
that
went
up
from
it
how
could
it
have
been
the
bell
the
bell
had
not
sounded
he
had
not
pulled
hard
enough
that
scream
was
fortuitous
the
night
on
that
rocky
ledge
had
jangled
his
nerves
he
pulled
again
and
more
firmly
the
answering
scream
was
more
terrible
rodriguez
could
doubt
no
longer
as
he
sprang
back
from
the
that
with
the
chain
he
had
pulled
he
inflicted
some
unknown
agony
the
scream
had
awakened
slow
steps
that
now
came
towards
the
travellers
down
corridors
as
it
sounded
of
stone
and
then
chains
fell
on
stone
and
the
door
of
oak
was
opened
by
some
one
older
than
what
man
hopes
to
come
to
with
small
peaked
lips
as
those
of
some
woodland
thing
señores
the
old
one
said
the
professor
welcomes
you
they
stood
and
stared
at
his
age
and
morano
blurted
uncouthly
what
both
of
them
felt
you
are
old
grandfather
he
said
ah
señores
the
old
man
sighed
the
professor
does
not
allow
me
to
be
young
i
have
been
here
years
and
years
but
he
never
allowed
it
i
have
served
him
well
but
it
is
still
the
same
i
say
to
him
i
have
served
you
long
but
he
interrupts
me
for
he
will
have
none
of
youth
young
servants
go
among
the
villages
he
says
and
so
and
so
you
do
not
think
your
master
can
give
you
youth
said
rodriguez
the
old
man
knew
that
he
had
talked
too
much
voicing
that
grievance
again
of
which
even
the
rocks
were
weary
yes
he
said
briefly
and
bowed
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
in
one
of
the
corridors
running
out
of
the
hall
down
which
he
was
leading
silently
rodriguez
overtook
that
old
man
and
questioned
him
to
his
face
who
is
this
professor
he
said
by
the
light
of
a
torch
that
spluttered
in
an
iron
clamp
on
the
wall
rodriguez
questioned
him
with
these
words
and
morano
with
his
wondering
wistful
eyes
the
old
man
halted
and
turned
half
round
and
lifted
his
head
and
answered
in
the
university
of
saragossa
he
said
with
pride
he
holds
the
chair
of
magic
even
the
names
of
oxford
or
cambridge
harvard
or
yale
or
princeton
move
some
respect
and
even
yet
in
these
unlearned
days
what
wonder
then
that
the
name
of
saragossa
heard
on
that
lonely
mountain
awoke
in
rodriguez
some
emotion
of
reverence
and
even
awed
morano
as
for
the
chair
of
magic
it
was
of
all
the
royal
endowments
of
that
illustrious
university
the
most
honoured
and
dreaded
at
saragossa
rodriguez
muttered
at
saragossa
the
old
man
affirmed
between
that
ancient
citadel
of
learning
and
this
most
savage
mountain
appeared
a
gulf
scarce
to
be
bridged
by
thought
the
professor
rests
in
his
mountain
the
old
man
said
because
of
a
conjunction
of
the
stars
unfavourable
to
study
and
his
class
have
gone
to
their
homes
for
many
weeks
he
bowed
again
and
led
on
along
that
corridor
of
dismal
stone
the
others
followed
and
still
as
rodriguez
went
that
famous
name
saragossa
echoed
within
his
mind
and
then
they
came
to
a
door
set
deep
in
the
stone
and
their
guide
opened
it
and
they
went
in
and
there
was
the
professor
in
a
mystical
hat
and
a
robe
of
dim
purple
seated
with
his
back
to
them
at
a
table
studying
the
ways
of
the
stars
welcome
don
rodriguez
said
the
professor
before
he
turned
round
and
then
he
rose
and
with
small
steps
backwards
and
sideways
and
many
bows
he
displayed
all
those
formulae
of
politeness
that
saragossa
knew
in
the
golden
age
and
which
her
professors
loved
to
execute
in
later
years
they
became
more
elaborate
still
and
afterwards
were
lost
rodriguez
replied
rather
by
instinct
than
knowledge
he
came
of
a
house
whose
bows
had
never
missed
graceful
ease
and
which
had
in
some
generations
been
a
joy
to
the
court
of
spain
morano
followed
behind
him
but
his
servile
presence
intruded
upon
that
elaborate
ceremony
and
the
professor
held
up
his
hand
and
morano
was
held
in
mid
stride
as
though
the
air
had
gripped
him
there
he
stood
motionless
having
never
felt
magic
before
and
when
the
professor
had
welcomed
rodriguez
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
dignity
of
the
chair
that
he
held
at
saragossa
he
made
an
easy
gesture
and
morano
was
free
again
master
said
morano
to
the
professor
as
soon
as
he
found
he
could
move
master
it
looks
like
magic
picture
to
yourself
some
yokel
shown
into
the
library
of
a
professor
of
greek
at
oxford
taking
down
from
a
shelf
one
of
the
books
of
the
odyssey
and
saying
to
the
professor
it
looks
like
greek
rodriguez
felt
grieved
by
morano
boorish
ignorance
neither
he
nor
his
host
answered
him
the
professor
explained
that
he
followed
the
mysteries
dimly
owing
to
a
certain
aspect
of
orion
and
that
therefore
his
class
were
gone
to
their
homes
and
were
hunting
and
so
he
studied
alone
under
unfavourable
auspices
and
once
more
he
welcomed
rodriguez
to
his
roof
and
would
command
straw
to
be
laid
down
for
the
man
that
rodriguez
had
brought
from
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
for
he
the
professor
saw
all
things
though
certain
stars
would
hide
everything
and
when
rodriguez
had
appropriately
uttered
his
thanks
he
added
with
all
humility
and
delicate
choice
of
phrase
a
petition
that
he
might
be
shown
some
mere
rudiment
of
the
studies
for
which
that
illustrious
chair
in
saragossa
was
famous
the
professor
bowed
again
and
in
accepting
the
compliments
that
rodriguez
paid
to
the
honoured
post
he
occupied
he
introduced
himself
by
name
he
had
been
once
he
said
the
count
of
the
mountain
but
when
his
astral
studies
had
made
him
eminent
and
he
had
mastered
the
ways
of
the
planet
nearest
the
sun
he
took
the
title
magister
mercurii
and
by
this
had
long
been
known
but
had
now
forsaken
this
title
great
as
it
was
for
a
more
glorious
nomenclature
and
was
called
in
the
arabic
language
the
slave
of
orion
when
rodriguez
heard
this
he
bowed
very
low
and
now
the
professor
asked
rodriguez
in
which
of
the
activities
of
life
his
interest
lay
for
the
chair
of
magic
at
saragossa
he
said
was
concerned
with
them
all
in
war
said
rodriguez
and
morano
unostentatiously
rubbed
his
hands
for
here
was
one
he
thought
who
would
soon
put
his
master
on
the
right
way
and
matters
would
come
to
a
head
and
they
would
find
the
wars
but
far
from
concerning
himself
with
the
wars
of
that
age
the
slave
of
orion
explained
that
as
events
came
nearer
they
became
grosser
or
more
material
and
that
their
grossness
did
not
leave
them
until
they
were
some
while
passed
away
so
that
to
one
whose
studies
were
with
aetherial
things
near
events
were
opaque
and
dim
he
had
a
window
he
explained
through
which
rodriguez
should
see
clearly
the
ancient
wars
while
another
window
beside
it
looked
on
all
wars
of
the
future
except
those
which
were
planned
already
or
were
coming
soon
to
earth
and
which
were
either
invisible
or
seen
dim
as
through
mist
rodriguez
said
that
to
be
privileged
to
see
so
classical
an
example
of
magic
would
be
to
him
both
a
delight
and
honour
yet
as
is
the
way
of
youth
he
more
desired
to
have
a
sight
of
the
wars
than
he
cared
for
all
the
learning
of
the
professor
and
to
him
who
held
the
chair
of
magic
at
saragossa
it
was
a
precious
thing
that
his
windows
could
be
made
to
show
these
marvels
while
the
guest
to
whom
he
was
about
to
display
these
two
gems
of
his
learning
was
thinking
of
little
but
what
he
should
see
through
the
windows
and
not
at
all
of
what
spells
what
midnight
oil
what
incantations
what
witchcrafts
what
lonely
hours
among
bats
had
gone
to
the
gratification
of
his
young
curiosity
it
is
usually
thus
the
professor
rose
his
cloak
floated
out
from
him
as
he
left
the
chamber
and
rodriguez
following
where
he
guided
saw
by
the
torchlight
in
the
corridors
upon
the
dim
purple
border
signs
that
to
his
untutored
ignorance
of
magic
were
no
more
than
hints
of
the
affairs
of
the
zodiac
and
if
these
signs
were
obscure
it
were
better
they
were
obscurer
for
they
dealt
with
powers
that
man
needs
not
to
possess
who
has
the
whole
earth
to
regulate
and
control
why
then
should
he
seek
to
govern
the
course
of
any
star
and
morano
followed
behind
them
hoping
to
be
allowed
to
get
a
sight
of
the
wars
they
came
to
a
room
where
two
round
windows
were
each
of
them
larger
than
the
very
largest
plate
and
of
very
thick
glass
indeed
and
of
a
wonderful
blue
the
blue
was
like
the
blue
of
the
mediterranean
at
evening
when
lights
are
in
it
both
of
ships
and
of
sunset
and
lights
of
harbours
being
lit
one
by
one
and
the
light
of
venus
perhaps
and
about
two
other
stars
so
deeply
did
it
stare
and
so
twinkled
near
its
edges
with
lights
that
were
strange
to
that
room
and
so
triumphed
with
its
clear
beauty
over
the
night
outside
no
it
was
more
magical
than
the
mediterranean
at
evening
even
though
the
peaks
of
the
esterels
be
purple
and
their
bases
melting
in
gold
and
the
blue
sea
lying
below
them
smiling
at
early
stars
these
windows
were
more
mysterious
than
that
it
was
a
more
triumphant
blue
it
was
like
the
mediterranean
seen
with
the
eyes
of
shelley
on
a
happy
day
in
his
youth
or
like
the
sea
round
western
islands
of
fable
seen
by
the
fancy
of
keats
they
were
no
windows
for
any
need
of
ours
unless
our
dreams
be
needs
unless
our
cries
for
the
moon
be
urged
by
the
same
necessity
as
makes
us
cry
for
bread
they
were
clearly
concerned
only
with
magic
or
poetry
though
the
professor
claimed
that
poetry
was
but
a
branch
of
his
subject
and
it
was
so
regarded
at
saragossa
where
it
was
taught
by
the
name
of
theoretical
magic
while
by
the
name
of
practical
magic
they
taught
dooms
brews
hauntings
and
spells
the
professor
stood
before
the
window
and
pointed
to
its
centre
through
this
he
said
we
see
the
wars
that
were
rodriguez
looked
into
the
centre
where
the
great
bulge
of
the
glass
came
out
towards
him
it
was
near
to
the
edges
where
the
glass
seemed
thinner
that
the
little
strange
lights
were
dancing
morano
dared
to
tiptoe
a
little
nearer
rodriguez
looked
and
saw
no
night
outside
just
below
and
near
to
the
window
was
white
mist
and
the
dim
lines
and
smoke
of
what
may
have
been
recent
wars
but
farther
away
on
a
plain
of
strangely
vast
dimensions
he
saw
old
wars
that
were
war
after
war
he
saw
battles
that
long
ago
had
passed
into
history
and
had
been
for
many
ages
skilled
glorious
and
pleasant
encounters
he
saw
even
now
tumbling
before
him
in
their
savage
confusion
and
dirt
he
saw
a
leader
long
glorious
in
histories
he
had
read
looking
round
puzzled
to
see
what
was
happening
and
in
a
very
famous
fight
that
he
had
planned
very
well
he
saw
retreats
that
history
called
routs
and
routs
that
he
had
seen
history
calling
retreats
he
saw
men
winning
victories
without
knowing
they
had
won
never
had
man
pried
before
so
shamelessly
upon
history
or
found
her
such
a
liar
with
his
eyes
on
the
great
blue
glass
rodriguez
forgot
the
room
forgot
time
forgot
his
host
and
poor
excited
morano
as
he
watched
those
famous
fights
and
now
my
reader
wishes
to
know
what
he
saw
and
how
it
was
that
he
was
able
to
see
it
as
regards
the
second
my
reader
will
readily
understand
that
the
secrets
of
magic
are
very
carefully
guarded
and
any
smatterings
of
it
that
i
may
ever
have
come
by
i
possess
for
what
they
are
worth
subjects
to
oaths
and
penalties
at
which
even
bad
men
shudder
my
reader
will
be
satisfied
that
even
those
intimate
bonds
between
reader
and
writer
are
of
no
use
to
him
here
i
say
him
as
though
i
had
only
male
readers
but
if
my
reader
be
a
lady
i
leave
the
situation
confidently
to
her
intuition
as
for
the
things
he
saw
of
all
of
these
i
am
at
full
liberty
to
write
and
yet
my
reader
they
would
differ
from
history
version
never
a
battle
that
rodriguez
saw
on
all
the
plain
that
swept
away
from
that
circular
window
but
history
wrote
differently
and
now
my
reader
the
situation
is
this
who
am
i
history
was
a
goddess
among
the
greeks
or
is
at
least
a
distinguished
personage
perhaps
with
a
knighthood
and
certainly
with
widespread
recognition
amongst
the
right
kind
of
people
i
have
none
of
these
things
whom
then
would
you
believe
yet
i
would
lay
my
story
confidently
before
you
my
reader
trusting
in
the
justice
of
my
case
and
in
your
judicial
discernment
but
for
one
other
thing
what
will
the
goddess
clio
say
or
the
knight
if
i
offend
history
she
has
stated
her
case
sir
bartimeus
has
written
it
and
then
so
late
in
the
day
i
come
with
a
different
story
a
truer
but
different
story
what
will
they
do
reader
the
future
is
dark
uncertain
and
long
i
dare
not
trust
myself
to
it
if
i
offend
history
clio
and
sir
bartimeus
will
make
hay
of
my
reputation
an
innuendo
here
a
foolish
fact
there
they
know
how
to
do
it
and
not
a
soul
will
suspect
the
goddess
of
personal
malice
or
the
great
historian
of
pique
rodriguez
gazed
then
through
the
deep
blue
window
forgetful
of
all
around
on
battles
that
had
not
all
the
elegance
or
neatness
of
which
our
histories
so
tidily
tell
and
as
he
gazed
upon
a
merry
encounter
between
two
men
on
the
fringe
of
an
ancient
fight
he
felt
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
and
then
almost
a
tug
and
turning
round
beheld
the
room
he
was
in
how
long
he
had
been
absent
from
it
in
thought
he
did
not
know
but
the
professor
was
still
standing
with
folded
arms
where
he
had
left
him
probably
well
satisfied
with
the
wonder
that
his
most
secret
art
had
awakened
in
his
guest
it
was
morano
who
touched
his
shoulder
unable
to
hold
back
any
longer
his
impatience
to
see
the
wars
his
eyes
as
rodriguez
turned
round
were
gazing
at
his
master
with
wistfulness
the
absurd
eagerness
of
morano
his
uncouth
touch
on
his
shoulder
seemed
only
pathetic
to
rodriguez
he
looked
at
the
professor
face
the
nose
like
a
hawk
beak
the
small
eyes
deep
down
beside
it
dark
of
hue
and
dreadfully
bright
the
silent
lips
he
stood
there
uttering
no
actual
prohibition
concerning
which
rodriguez
eyes
had
sought
so
stepping
aside
from
his
window
rodriguez
beckoned
morano
who
at
once
ran
forward
delighted
to
see
those
ancient
wars
a
slight
look
of
scorn
showed
faint
upon
the
professor
face
such
as
you
may
see
anywhere
when
a
perceives
the
gaze
of
the
ignorant
turned
towards
his
particular
subject
but
he
said
no
word
and
soon
speech
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
loud
clamour
of
morano
filled
the
room
he
had
seen
the
wars
and
his
ecstasies
were
ungoverned
as
soon
as
he
saw
those
fights
he
looked
for
the
infidels
for
his
religious
mind
most
loved
to
see
the
infidel
slain
and
if
my
reader
discern
or
suppose
some
gulf
between
religion
and
the
recent
business
of
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
morano
if
driven
to
admit
any
connection
between
murder
and
his
daily
bread
would
have
said
all
the
more
need
then
for
god
mercy
through
the
intercession
of
his
most
blessed
saints
but
these
words
had
never
passed
lips
for
shrewd
as
he
was
in
enquiry
into
any
matter
that
he
desired
to
know
his
shrewdness
was
no
less
in
avoiding
enquiry
where
there
might
be
something
that
he
desired
not
to
know
such
as
the
origin
of
his
wages
as
servant
of
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
those
delicate
gold
rings
with
settings
empty
of
jewels
morano
soon
recognized
the
infidel
by
his
dress
and
after
that
no
other
wars
concerned
him
he
slapped
his
thigh
he
shouted
encouragement
he
howled
vile
words
of
abuse
partly
because
he
believed
that
this
foul
abuse
was
rightly
the
due
of
the
infidel
and
partly
because
he
believed
it
delighted
god
rodriguez
stood
and
watched
pleased
at
the
huge
joy
of
the
simple
man
the
slave
of
orion
stood
watching
in
silence
too
but
who
knows
if
he
felt
pleasure
or
any
other
emotion
perhaps
his
mind
was
simply
like
ours
perhaps
as
has
been
claimed
by
learned
men
of
the
period
that
mind
had
some
control
upon
the
comet
even
when
farthest
out
from
the
paths
we
know
morano
turned
round
for
a
moment
to
rodriguez
good
wars
master
good
wars
he
said
with
a
vast
zest
and
at
once
his
head
was
back
again
at
that
calm
blue
window
in
that
flash
of
the
head
rodriguez
had
seen
his
eyes
blue
round
and
bulging
the
round
man
was
like
a
boy
who
in
some
shop
window
has
seen
unexpected
huge
forbidden
sweets
clearly
in
the
war
he
watched
things
were
going
well
for
the
cross
for
such
cries
came
from
morano
as
a
pretty
stroke
there
now
the
dirty
infidel
now
see
god
power
shown
spare
him
not
good
knight
spare
him
not
and
many
more
till
uttered
faster
and
faster
they
merged
into
mere
clamorous
rejoicing
but
the
battles
beyond
the
blue
window
seemed
to
move
fast
and
now
a
change
was
passing
across
morano
rejoicings
it
was
not
that
he
swore
more
for
the
cause
of
the
cross
but
brief
impatient
meaningless
oaths
slipped
from
him
now
he
was
becoming
irritable
a
puzzled
look
so
far
as
rodriguez
could
see
was
settling
down
on
his
features
for
a
while
he
was
silent
except
for
the
little
meaningless
oaths
then
he
turned
round
from
the
glass
his
hands
stretched
out
his
face
full
of
urgent
appeal
masters
he
said
god
enemy
wins
in
answer
to
morano
pitiful
look
rodriguez
hand
went
to
his
the
slave
of
orion
merely
smiled
with
his
lips
morano
stood
there
with
his
hands
still
stretched
out
his
face
still
all
appeal
and
something
more
for
there
was
reproach
in
his
eyes
that
men
could
tarry
while
the
cross
was
in
danger
and
the
infidel
lived
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
all
finished
and
over
hundreds
of
years
ago
a
page
of
history
upon
which
many
pages
were
turned
and
which
lay
as
unalterable
as
the
fate
of
some
warm
swift
creature
of
early
eocene
days
over
whose
fossil
today
the
strata
lie
long
and
silent
but
can
nothing
be
done
master
he
said
when
rodriguez
told
him
this
and
when
rodriguez
failed
him
here
he
turned
away
from
the
window
to
him
the
infidel
were
game
but
to
see
them
defeating
christian
knights
violated
the
deeps
of
his
feelings
morano
sulky
excited
little
more
notice
from
his
host
and
his
master
who
had
watched
his
rejoicings
and
they
seem
to
have
forgotten
this
humble
champion
of
christendom
the
professor
slightly
bowed
to
rodriguez
and
extended
a
graceful
hand
he
pointed
to
the
other
window
reader
your
friend
shows
you
his
collection
of
stamps
his
fossils
his
poems
or
his
luggage
labels
one
of
them
interests
you
you
look
at
it
awhile
you
are
ready
to
go
away
then
your
friend
shows
you
another
this
also
must
be
seen
for
your
friend
collection
is
a
precious
thing
it
is
that
point
upon
huge
earth
on
which
his
spirit
has
lit
on
which
it
rests
on
which
it
shelters
even
who
knows
from
what
storms
to
slight
it
were
to
weaken
such
hold
as
his
spirit
has
in
its
allotted
time
upon
this
sphere
it
were
like
breaking
the
twig
of
a
plant
upon
which
a
butterfly
rests
and
on
some
stormy
day
and
late
in
the
year
rodriguez
felt
all
this
dimly
but
no
less
surely
and
went
to
the
other
window
below
the
window
were
those
wars
that
were
soon
coming
to
spain
hooded
in
mist
and
invisible
in
the
centre
of
the
window
swam
as
profound
a
blue
dwindling
to
paler
splendour
at
the
edge
the
wandering
lights
were
as
lovely
as
in
the
other
window
just
to
the
left
but
in
the
view
from
the
window
how
sombre
a
difference
a
bare
yard
separated
the
two
through
the
window
to
the
left
was
colour
courtesy
splendour
there
was
death
at
least
disguising
himself
well
cloaked
taking
mincing
steps
bowing
wearing
a
plume
in
his
hat
and
a
decent
mask
in
the
window
all
the
colours
were
fading
war
after
war
they
grew
dimmer
and
as
the
colours
paled
death
sole
purpose
showed
clearer
through
the
beautiful
window
were
killings
to
be
seen
and
less
mercy
than
history
supposes
yet
some
of
the
fighters
were
merciful
and
mercy
was
sometimes
a
part
of
death
courtly
pose
which
went
with
the
cloak
and
the
plume
but
in
the
other
window
through
that
deep
beautiful
blue
rodriguez
saw
man
make
a
new
ally
an
ally
who
was
only
cruel
and
strong
and
had
no
purpose
but
killing
who
had
no
pretences
or
pose
no
mask
and
no
manner
but
was
only
the
slave
of
death
and
had
no
care
but
for
his
business
he
saw
it
grow
bigger
and
stronger
heart
it
had
none
but
he
saw
its
cold
steel
core
scheming
methodical
plans
and
dreaming
always
destruction
before
it
faded
men
and
their
fields
and
their
houses
rodriguez
saw
the
machine
many
a
proud
invention
of
ours
that
rodriguez
saw
raging
on
that
ruinous
plain
he
might
have
anticipated
but
not
for
all
spain
would
he
have
done
so
it
was
for
the
sake
of
spain
that
he
was
silent
about
much
that
he
saw
through
that
window
as
he
looked
from
war
to
war
he
saw
almost
the
same
men
fighting
men
with
always
the
same
attitude
to
the
moment
and
with
similar
dim
conception
of
larger
vaguer
things
grandson
differed
imperceptibly
from
grandfather
he
saw
them
fight
sometimes
mercifully
sometimes
murderously
but
in
all
the
wars
beyond
that
twinkling
window
he
saw
the
machine
spare
nothing
then
he
looked
farther
for
the
wars
that
were
farthest
from
him
in
time
were
farther
away
from
the
window
he
looked
farther
and
saw
the
ruins
of
peronne
he
saw
them
all
alone
with
their
doom
at
night
all
drenched
in
white
moonlight
sheltering
huge
darkness
in
their
stricken
hollows
down
the
white
street
past
darkness
after
darkness
as
he
went
by
the
gaping
rooms
that
the
moon
left
mourning
alone
rodriguez
saw
a
captain
going
back
to
the
wars
in
that
time
who
turned
his
head
a
moment
as
he
passed
looking
rodriguez
in
the
face
and
so
went
on
through
the
ruins
to
find
a
floor
on
which
to
lie
down
for
the
night
when
he
was
gone
the
street
was
all
alone
with
disaster
and
moonlight
pouring
down
and
the
black
gloom
in
the
houses
rodriguez
lifted
his
eyes
and
glanced
from
city
to
city
to
albert
bapaume
and
arras
his
gaze
moved
over
a
plain
with
its
harvest
of
desolation
lying
forlorn
and
ungathered
lit
by
the
flashing
clouds
and
the
moon
and
peering
rockets
he
turned
from
the
window
and
wept
the
deep
round
window
glowed
with
serene
blue
glory
it
seemed
a
foolish
thing
to
weep
by
that
beautiful
glass
morano
tried
to
comfort
him
that
calm
deep
blue
he
felt
and
those
little
lights
surely
could
hurt
no
one
what
had
rodriguez
seen
morano
asked
but
that
rodriguez
would
not
answer
and
told
no
man
ever
after
what
he
had
seen
through
that
window
the
professor
stood
silent
still
he
had
no
comfort
to
offer
indeed
his
magical
wisdom
had
found
none
for
the
world
you
wonder
perhaps
why
the
professor
did
not
give
long
ago
to
the
world
some
of
these
marvels
that
are
the
pride
of
our
age
reader
let
us
put
aside
my
tale
for
a
moment
to
answer
this
for
all
the
darkness
of
his
sinister
art
there
may
well
have
been
some
good
in
the
slave
of
orion
and
any
good
there
was
and
mere
particle
even
would
surely
have
spared
the
world
many
of
those
inventions
that
our
age
has
not
spared
it
blame
not
the
age
it
is
now
too
late
to
stop
it
is
in
the
grip
of
inventions
now
and
has
to
go
on
we
can
not
stop
content
with
it
is
the
age
of
progress
and
our
motto
is
onwards
and
if
there
was
no
good
in
this
magical
man
then
may
it
not
have
been
he
who
in
due
course
long
after
he
himself
was
safe
from
life
caused
our
inventions
to
be
so
deadly
divulged
some
evil
spirit
has
done
it
then
why
not
he
he
stood
there
silent
let
us
return
to
our
story
perhaps
the
efforts
of
poor
clumsy
morano
to
comfort
him
cheered
rodriguez
and
sent
him
back
to
the
window
perhaps
he
turned
from
them
to
find
comfort
of
his
own
but
however
he
came
by
it
he
had
a
hope
that
this
was
a
passing
curse
that
had
come
on
the
world
whose
welfare
he
cared
for
whether
he
lived
or
died
and
that
looking
a
little
farther
into
the
future
he
would
see
mother
earth
smiling
and
her
children
happy
again
so
he
looked
through
the
luminous
window
once
more
beyond
the
battles
we
know
from
this
he
turned
back
shuddering
again
he
saw
the
professor
smile
with
his
lips
though
whether
at
his
own
weakness
or
whether
with
cynical
mirth
at
the
fate
of
the
world
rodriguez
could
not
say
the
fourth
chronicle
how
he
came
to
the
mountains
of
the
sun
the
professor
said
that
in
curiosity
alone
had
been
found
the
seeds
of
all
that
is
needful
for
our
damnation
nevertheless
he
said
if
rodriguez
cared
to
see
more
of
his
mighty
art
the
mysteries
of
saragossa
were
all
at
his
guest
disposal
rodriguez
sad
and
horrified
though
he
was
forgot
none
of
his
courtesy
he
thanked
the
professor
and
praised
the
art
of
saragossa
but
his
faith
in
man
and
his
hope
for
the
world
having
been
newly
disappointed
he
cared
little
enough
for
the
things
we
should
care
to
see
or
for
any
of
the
amusements
that
are
usually
dear
to
youth
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
anything
señor
he
said
to
the
slave
of
orion
that
is
further
from
our
poor
earth
and
to
study
therein
and
admire
your
famous
art
the
professor
bowed
he
drew
small
curtains
over
the
windows
matching
his
cloak
morano
sought
a
glimpse
through
the
window
before
the
curtains
covered
it
rodriguez
held
him
back
enough
had
been
seen
already
he
thought
through
that
window
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
the
world
but
he
said
no
word
to
morano
he
held
him
by
the
arm
and
the
professor
covered
the
windows
when
the
little
mauve
curtains
were
drawn
it
seemed
to
rodriguez
that
the
windows
behind
them
disappeared
and
were
there
no
more
but
this
he
only
guessed
from
uncertain
indications
then
the
professor
drew
forth
his
wand
and
went
to
his
cupboard
of
wonder
thence
he
brought
condiments
oils
and
dews
of
amazement
these
he
poured
into
a
vessel
that
was
in
the
midst
of
the
room
a
bowl
of
agate
standing
alone
on
a
table
he
lit
it
and
it
all
welled
up
in
flame
a
low
broad
flame
of
the
colour
of
pale
emerald
over
this
he
waved
his
wand
which
was
of
exceeding
blackness
morano
watched
as
children
watch
the
dancer
who
goes
from
village
to
village
when
spring
is
come
with
some
new
dance
out
of
asia
or
some
new
song
footnote
he
does
but
why
should
he
rodriguez
sat
and
waited
the
professor
explained
that
to
leave
this
earth
alive
or
even
dead
was
prohibited
to
our
bodies
unless
to
a
very
few
whose
names
were
hidden
yet
the
spirits
of
men
could
by
incantation
be
liberated
and
being
liberated
could
be
directed
on
journeys
by
such
minds
as
had
that
power
passed
down
to
them
from
of
old
such
journeys
he
said
were
by
no
means
confined
by
the
hills
of
earth
the
saints
exclaimed
morano
guard
us
utterly
but
rodriguez
smiled
a
little
his
faith
was
given
to
the
saints
of
heaven
he
wondered
at
their
wonders
he
admired
their
miracles
he
had
little
faith
to
spare
for
other
marvels
in
fact
he
did
not
believe
the
slave
of
orion
do
you
desire
such
a
journey
said
the
professor
it
will
delight
me
answered
rodriguez
to
see
this
example
of
your
art
and
you
he
said
to
morano
the
question
seemed
to
alarm
the
placid
morano
but
i
follow
my
master
he
said
at
once
the
professor
stretched
out
his
ebony
wand
calling
the
green
flame
higher
then
he
put
out
his
hands
over
the
flame
without
the
wand
moving
them
slowly
with
constantly
tremulous
fingers
and
all
at
once
they
heard
him
begin
to
speak
his
deep
voice
flowed
musically
while
he
scarcely
seemed
to
be
speaking
but
seemed
only
to
be
concerned
with
moving
his
hands
it
came
soft
as
though
blown
faint
from
fabulous
valleys
illimitably
far
from
the
land
of
spain
it
seemed
full
not
so
much
of
magic
as
mere
sleep
either
sleep
in
an
unknown
country
of
alien
men
or
sleep
in
a
land
dreamed
sleeping
a
long
while
since
as
the
travellers
heard
it
they
thought
of
things
far
away
of
mythical
journeys
and
their
own
earliest
years
they
did
not
know
what
he
said
or
what
language
he
used
at
first
rodriguez
thought
moorish
then
he
deemed
it
some
secret
language
come
down
from
magicians
of
old
while
morano
merely
wondered
and
then
they
were
lulled
by
the
rhythm
of
those
strange
words
and
so
enquired
no
more
rodriguez
pictured
some
sad
wandering
angel
upon
some
of
african
lands
resting
a
moment
and
talking
to
the
solitudes
telling
the
lonely
valley
the
mysteries
of
his
home
while
lulled
though
morano
was
he
gave
up
his
alertness
uneasily
all
the
while
the
green
flame
flooded
upwards
all
the
while
the
tremulous
fingers
made
curious
shadows
the
shadow
seemed
to
run
to
rodriguez
and
beckon
him
thence
even
morano
felt
them
calling
rodriguez
closed
his
eyes
the
voice
and
the
moorish
spells
made
now
a
more
haunting
melody
they
were
now
like
a
golden
organ
on
undiscoverable
mountains
fear
came
on
morano
at
the
thought
who
had
power
to
speak
like
this
he
grasped
rodriguez
by
the
wrist
master
he
said
but
at
that
moment
on
one
of
those
golden
spells
the
spirit
of
rodriguez
drifted
away
from
his
body
and
out
of
the
greenish
light
of
the
curious
room
unhampered
by
weight
or
fatigue
or
pain
or
sleep
and
it
rose
above
the
rocks
and
over
the
mountain
an
unencumbered
spirit
and
the
spirit
of
morano
followed
the
mountain
dwindled
at
once
the
earth
swept
out
all
round
them
and
grew
larger
and
larger
still
and
then
began
to
dwindle
they
saw
then
that
they
were
launched
upon
some
astounding
journey
does
my
reader
wonder
they
saw
when
they
had
no
eyes
they
saw
as
they
had
never
seen
before
with
sight
beyond
what
they
had
ever
thought
to
be
possible
our
eyes
gather
in
light
and
with
the
little
rays
of
light
that
they
bring
us
we
gather
a
few
images
of
things
as
we
suppose
them
to
be
pardon
me
reader
if
i
call
them
things
as
we
suppose
them
to
be
call
them
by
all
means
things
as
they
really
are
if
you
wish
these
images
then
this
tiny
little
brainful
that
we
gather
from
the
immensities
are
all
brought
in
by
our
eyesight
and
the
brain
corrects
them
again
and
so
and
so
we
know
something
an
oculist
will
tell
you
how
it
all
works
he
may
admit
it
is
all
a
little
clumsy
or
for
the
dignity
of
his
profession
he
may
say
it
is
not
at
all
but
be
this
as
it
may
our
eyes
are
but
barriers
between
us
and
the
immensities
all
our
five
senses
that
grope
a
little
here
and
touch
a
little
there
and
seize
and
compare
notes
and
get
a
little
knowledge
sometimes
they
are
only
barriers
between
us
and
what
there
is
to
know
rodriguez
and
morano
were
outside
these
barriers
they
saw
without
the
imperfections
of
eyesight
they
heard
on
that
journey
what
would
have
deafened
ears
they
went
through
our
atmosphere
unburned
by
speed
and
were
unchilled
in
the
bleak
of
the
outer
spaces
thus
freed
of
the
imperfections
of
the
body
they
sped
no
less
upon
a
terrible
journey
whose
direction
as
yet
rodriguez
only
began
to
fear
they
had
seen
the
stars
pale
rapidly
and
then
the
flash
of
dawn
the
sun
rushed
up
and
at
once
began
to
grow
larger
earth
with
her
curved
sides
still
diminishing
violently
was
soon
a
small
round
garden
in
blue
and
filmy
space
in
which
mountains
were
planted
and
still
the
sun
was
growing
wider
and
wider
and
now
rodriguez
though
he
knew
nothing
of
sun
or
planets
perceived
the
obvious
truth
of
their
terrible
journey
they
were
heading
straight
for
the
sun
but
the
spirit
of
morano
was
merely
astounded
yet
being
free
of
the
body
he
suffered
none
of
those
inconveniences
that
perturbation
may
bring
to
us
spirits
do
not
gasp
or
palpitate
or
weaken
or
sicken
the
dwindling
earth
seemed
now
no
more
than
the
size
of
some
unmapped
island
seen
from
a
an
island
a
hundred
yards
or
so
across
looking
like
a
big
table
speed
is
comparative
compared
to
sound
their
pace
was
beyond
comparison
nor
could
any
modern
projectile
attain
any
velocity
comparable
to
it
even
the
speed
of
explosion
was
slow
to
it
and
yet
for
spirits
they
were
moving
slowly
who
being
independent
of
all
material
things
travel
with
such
velocities
as
that
for
instance
of
thought
but
they
were
controlled
by
one
still
dwelling
on
earth
who
used
material
things
and
the
material
that
the
professor
was
using
to
hurl
them
upon
their
journey
was
light
the
adaptation
of
which
to
this
purpose
he
had
learned
at
saragossa
at
the
pace
of
light
they
were
travelling
towards
the
sun
they
crossed
the
path
of
venus
far
from
where
venus
then
was
so
that
she
scarcely
seemed
larger
to
them
earth
was
but
little
bigger
than
the
evening
star
looking
dim
in
that
monstrous
daylight
crossing
the
path
of
mercury
mercury
appeared
huger
than
our
moon
an
object
weirdly
unnatural
and
they
saw
ahead
of
them
the
terrific
glare
in
which
mercury
basks
from
a
sun
whose
withering
orb
had
more
than
doubled
its
width
since
they
came
from
the
hills
of
earth
and
after
this
the
sun
grew
terribly
larger
filling
the
centre
of
the
sky
and
spreading
and
spreading
and
spreading
it
was
now
that
they
saw
what
would
have
dazzled
eyes
would
have
burned
up
flesh
and
would
have
shrivelled
every
protection
that
our
scientists
ingenuity
could
have
devised
even
today
to
speak
of
time
there
is
meaningless
there
is
nothing
in
the
empty
space
between
the
sun
and
mercury
with
which
time
is
at
all
concerned
far
less
is
there
meaning
in
time
wherever
the
spirits
of
men
are
under
stress
a
few
minutes
bombardment
in
a
trench
a
few
hours
in
a
battle
a
few
weeks
travelling
in
a
trackless
country
these
minutes
these
hours
these
weeks
can
never
be
few
rodriguez
and
morano
had
been
travelling
about
six
or
seven
minutes
but
it
seems
idle
to
say
so
and
then
the
sun
began
to
fill
the
whole
sky
in
front
of
them
and
in
another
minute
if
minutes
had
any
meaning
they
were
heading
for
a
boundless
region
of
flame
that
left
and
right
was
everywhere
and
now
towered
above
them
and
went
below
them
into
a
flaming
abyss
and
now
morano
spoke
to
rodriguez
he
thought
towards
him
and
rodriguez
was
aware
of
his
thinking
it
is
thus
that
spirits
communicate
master
he
said
when
it
was
all
spring
in
spain
years
ago
when
i
was
thin
and
young
twenty
years
gone
at
least
and
the
butterflies
were
come
and
song
was
everywhere
there
came
a
maid
over
a
stream
walking
through
flowers
and
all
to
pluck
the
anemones
how
fair
she
seemed
even
now
how
bright
that
far
spring
day
morano
told
rodriguez
not
with
his
blundering
lips
they
were
closed
and
resting
deeply
millions
of
miles
away
he
told
him
as
spirits
tell
and
in
that
clear
communication
rodriguez
saw
all
that
shone
in
morano
memory
the
grace
of
the
young
girl
ankles
the
thrill
of
spring
the
anemones
larger
and
brighter
than
anemones
ever
were
the
hawks
still
in
clear
sky
earth
happy
and
heaven
blue
and
the
dreams
of
youth
between
you
would
not
have
said
had
you
seen
morano
coarse
fat
body
asleep
in
a
chair
in
the
professor
room
that
his
spirit
treasured
such
delicate
pastoral
memories
as
now
shone
clear
to
rodriguez
no
words
the
blunt
man
had
ever
been
able
to
utter
had
ever
hinted
that
he
sometimes
thought
like
a
dream
of
pictures
by
watteau
and
now
in
that
awful
space
before
the
power
of
the
terrible
sun
spirit
communed
with
spirit
and
rodriguez
saw
the
beauty
of
that
far
day
framed
all
about
the
beauty
of
one
young
girl
just
as
it
had
been
for
years
in
morano
memory
how
shall
i
tell
with
words
what
spirit
sang
wordless
to
spirit
we
poets
may
compete
with
each
other
in
words
but
when
spirits
give
up
the
purest
gold
of
their
store
that
has
shone
far
down
the
road
of
their
earthly
journey
cheering
tired
hearts
and
guiding
mortal
feet
our
words
shall
barely
interpret
love
coming
long
ago
over
flowers
in
spain
found
morano
words
did
not
tell
the
story
words
can
not
tell
it
as
a
lake
reflects
a
cloud
in
the
blue
of
heaven
so
rodriguez
understood
and
felt
and
knew
this
memory
out
of
the
days
of
morano
youth
and
so
master
said
morano
i
sinned
and
would
indeed
repent
and
yet
even
now
at
this
last
dread
hour
i
can
not
abjure
that
day
and
this
is
indeed
hell
as
the
good
father
said
rodriguez
tried
to
comfort
morano
with
such
knowledge
as
he
had
of
astronomy
if
knowledge
it
could
be
called
indeed
if
he
had
known
anything
he
would
have
perplexed
morano
more
and
his
little
pieces
of
ignorance
were
well
adapted
for
comfort
but
morano
had
given
up
hope
having
long
been
taught
to
expect
this
very
fire
his
spirit
was
no
wiser
than
it
had
been
on
earth
it
was
merely
freed
of
the
imperfections
of
the
five
senses
and
so
had
observation
and
expression
beyond
those
of
any
artist
the
world
has
known
this
was
the
natural
result
of
being
freed
of
the
body
but
he
was
not
suddenly
wiser
and
so
as
he
moved
towards
this
boundless
flame
he
expected
every
moment
to
see
satan
charge
out
to
meet
him
and
having
no
hope
for
the
future
he
turned
to
the
past
and
fondled
the
memory
of
that
one
spring
day
his
was
a
backsliding
unrepentant
spirit
as
that
monstrous
sea
of
flame
grew
ruthlessly
larger
rodriguez
felt
no
fear
for
spirits
have
no
fear
of
material
things
but
morano
feared
he
feared
as
spirits
fear
spiritual
things
he
thought
he
neared
the
home
of
vast
spirits
of
evil
and
that
the
arena
of
conflict
was
eternity
he
feared
with
a
fear
too
great
to
be
borne
by
bodies
perhaps
the
fat
body
that
slept
on
a
chair
on
earth
was
troubled
in
dreams
by
some
echo
of
that
fear
that
gripped
the
spirit
so
sorely
and
it
may
be
from
such
far
fears
that
all
our
nightmares
come
when
they
had
travelled
nearly
ten
minutes
from
earth
and
were
about
to
pass
into
the
midst
of
the
flame
that
magician
who
controlled
their
journey
halted
them
suddenly
in
space
among
the
upper
of
the
sun
there
they
hovered
as
the
clouds
hover
that
leave
their
companions
and
drift
among
crags
of
the
alps
below
them
those
awful
mountains
heaved
and
thundered
all
atlas
and
teneriffe
and
lonely
kenia
might
have
lain
amongst
them
unnoticed
as
often
as
the
earthquake
rocked
their
bases
it
loosened
from
near
their
summits
wild
avalanches
of
gold
that
swept
down
their
flaming
slopes
with
unthinkable
tumult
as
they
watched
new
mountains
rode
past
them
crowned
with
their
frightful
flames
for
whether
man
knew
it
or
not
the
sun
was
rotating
but
the
force
of
its
gravity
that
swung
the
planets
had
no
grip
upon
spirits
who
were
held
by
the
power
of
that
tremendous
spell
that
the
professor
had
learned
one
midnight
at
saragossa
from
one
of
that
dread
line
who
have
their
secrets
from
a
source
that
we
do
not
know
in
a
distant
age
there
is
always
something
tremendous
in
the
form
of
great
mountains
but
these
swept
by
not
only
huger
than
anything
earth
knows
but
troubled
by
horrible
commotions
as
though
overtaken
in
flight
by
some
ceaseless
calamity
rodriguez
and
morano
as
they
looked
at
them
forgetting
the
gardens
of
earth
forgetting
spring
and
summer
and
the
sweet
beneficence
of
sunshine
felt
that
the
purpose
of
creation
was
evil
so
shocking
a
thought
may
well
astound
us
here
where
green
hills
slope
to
lawns
or
peer
at
a
peaceful
sea
but
there
among
the
flames
of
those
dreadful
peaks
the
sun
seemed
not
the
giver
of
joy
and
colour
and
life
but
only
a
catastrophe
huger
than
everlasting
war
a
centre
of
hideous
violence
and
ruin
and
anger
and
terror
there
came
by
mountains
of
copper
burning
everlasting
hurling
up
to
unthinkable
heights
their
mass
of
emerald
flame
and
mountains
of
iron
raged
by
and
mountains
of
salt
quaking
and
thundering
and
clothed
with
their
colours
the
iron
always
scarlet
and
the
salt
blue
and
sometimes
there
came
by
pinnacles
a
thousand
miles
high
that
from
base
to
summit
were
fire
mountains
of
pure
flame
that
had
no
other
substance
and
these
explosive
mountains
born
of
thunder
and
earthquake
hurling
down
avalanches
the
size
of
our
continents
and
drawing
upward
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
sun
new
material
for
splendour
and
horror
this
roaring
waste
this
extravagant
destruction
were
necessary
for
every
tint
that
our
butterflies
wear
on
their
wings
without
those
flaming
ranges
of
mountains
of
iron
they
would
have
no
red
to
show
even
the
poppy
could
have
no
red
for
her
petals
without
the
flames
that
were
blasting
the
mountains
of
salt
there
could
be
no
answering
blue
in
any
wing
or
one
blue
flower
for
all
the
bees
of
earth
without
the
nightmare
light
of
those
frightful
canyons
of
copper
that
awed
the
two
spirits
watching
their
ceaseless
ruin
the
very
leaves
of
the
woods
we
love
would
be
without
their
green
with
which
to
welcome
spring
for
from
the
flames
of
the
various
metals
and
wonders
that
for
ever
blaze
in
the
sun
our
sunshine
gets
all
its
colours
that
it
conveys
to
us
almost
unseen
and
thence
the
wise
little
insects
and
patient
flowers
softly
draw
the
gay
tints
that
they
glory
in
there
is
nowhere
else
to
get
them
and
yet
to
rodriguez
and
morano
all
that
they
saw
seemed
wholly
and
hideously
evil
how
long
they
may
have
watched
there
they
tried
to
guess
afterwards
but
as
they
looked
on
those
terrific
scenes
they
had
no
way
to
separate
days
from
minutes
nothing
about
them
seemed
to
escape
destruction
and
time
itself
seemed
no
calmer
than
were
those
shuddering
mountains
then
the
thundering
ranges
passed
and
afterwards
there
came
a
gleaming
mountain
one
huge
and
lonely
peak
seemingly
all
of
gold
had
our
whole
world
been
set
beside
it
and
shaped
as
it
was
shaped
that
golden
mountain
would
yet
have
towered
above
it
it
would
have
taken
our
moon
as
well
to
reach
that
flashing
peak
it
rode
on
toward
them
in
its
golden
majesty
higher
than
all
the
flames
save
now
and
then
when
some
wild
gas
seemed
to
flee
from
the
dread
earthquakes
of
the
sun
and
was
overtaken
in
the
height
by
fire
even
above
that
mountain
as
that
mass
of
gold
that
was
higher
than
all
the
world
drew
near
to
rodriguez
and
morano
they
felt
its
unearthly
menace
and
though
it
could
not
overcome
their
spirits
they
knew
there
was
a
hideous
terror
about
it
it
was
in
its
awful
scale
that
its
terror
lurked
for
any
creature
of
our
planet
though
they
could
not
quake
or
tremble
they
felt
that
terror
the
mountain
dwarfed
earth
man
knows
his
littleness
his
own
mountains
remind
him
many
countries
are
small
and
some
nations
but
the
dreams
of
man
make
up
for
our
faults
and
failings
for
the
brevity
of
our
lives
for
the
narrowness
of
our
scope
they
leap
over
boundaries
and
are
away
and
away
but
this
great
mountain
belittled
the
world
and
all
who
gazed
on
it
knew
all
his
dreams
to
be
puny
before
this
mountain
man
seemed
a
trivial
thing
and
earth
and
all
the
dreams
man
had
of
himself
and
his
home
the
golden
mass
drew
opposite
those
two
watchers
and
seemed
to
challenge
with
its
towering
head
the
pettiness
of
the
tiny
world
they
knew
and
then
the
whole
gleaming
mountain
gave
one
shudder
and
fell
into
the
awful
plains
of
the
sun
straight
down
before
rodriguez
and
morano
it
slipped
roaring
till
the
golden
peak
was
gone
and
the
molten
plain
closed
over
it
and
only
ripples
remained
the
size
of
europe
as
when
a
tumbling
river
strikes
the
rocks
of
its
bed
and
on
its
surface
heaving
circles
widen
and
disappear
and
then
as
though
this
horror
left
nothing
more
to
be
shown
they
felt
the
professor
beckon
to
them
from
earth
over
the
plains
of
the
sun
a
storm
was
sweeping
in
gusts
of
howling
flame
as
they
felt
the
professor
spell
drawing
them
home
for
the
magnitude
of
that
storm
there
are
no
words
in
use
among
us
its
velocity
if
expressed
in
figures
would
have
no
meaning
its
heat
was
immeasurable
suffice
it
to
say
that
if
such
a
tempest
could
have
swept
over
earth
for
a
second
both
the
poles
would
have
boiled
the
travellers
left
it
galloping
over
that
plain
rippled
from
underneath
by
the
restless
earthquake
and
whipped
into
flaming
foam
by
the
force
of
the
storm
the
sun
already
was
receding
from
them
already
growing
smaller
soon
the
storm
seemed
but
a
cloud
of
light
sweeping
over
the
empty
plain
like
a
murderous
mourner
rushing
swiftly
away
from
the
grave
of
that
mighty
mountain
and
now
the
professor
spell
gripped
them
in
earnest
rapidly
the
sun
grew
smaller
as
swiftly
as
he
had
sent
them
upon
that
journey
he
was
now
drawing
them
home
they
overtook
thunders
that
they
had
heard
already
and
passed
them
and
came
again
to
the
silent
spaces
which
the
thunders
of
the
sun
are
unable
to
cross
so
that
even
mercury
is
undisturbed
by
them
i
have
said
that
spirits
neither
fade
nor
weary
but
a
great
sadness
was
on
them
they
felt
as
men
feel
who
come
whole
away
from
periods
of
peril
they
had
seen
cataclysms
too
vast
for
our
imagination
and
a
mournfulness
and
a
satiety
were
upon
them
they
could
have
gazed
at
one
flower
for
days
and
needed
no
other
experience
as
a
wounded
man
may
be
happy
staring
at
the
flame
of
a
candle
crossing
the
paths
of
mercury
and
venus
they
saw
that
these
planets
had
not
appreciably
moved
and
rodriguez
who
knew
that
planets
wander
in
the
night
guessed
thereby
that
they
had
not
been
absent
from
earth
for
many
hours
they
rejoiced
to
see
the
sun
diminishing
steadily
only
for
a
moment
as
they
started
their
journey
had
they
seen
that
solar
storm
rushing
over
the
plains
of
the
sun
but
now
it
appeared
to
hang
halted
in
its
mid
anger
as
though
blasting
one
region
eternally
moving
on
with
the
pace
of
light
they
saw
earth
soon
after
crossing
the
path
of
venus
beginning
to
grow
larger
than
a
star
never
had
home
appeared
more
welcome
to
wanderers
who
see
their
house
far
off
returning
home
and
as
earth
grew
larger
and
they
began
to
see
forms
that
seemed
like
seas
and
mountains
they
looked
for
their
own
country
but
could
not
find
it
for
travelling
straight
from
the
sun
they
approached
that
part
of
the
world
that
was
then
turned
towards
it
and
were
heading
straight
for
china
while
spain
lay
still
in
darkness
but
when
they
came
near
earth
and
its
mountains
were
clear
then
the
professor
drew
them
across
the
world
into
the
darkness
and
over
spain
so
that
those
two
spirits
ended
their
marvellous
journey
much
as
the
snipe
ends
his
a
drop
out
of
heaven
and
a
swoop
low
over
marshes
so
they
came
home
while
earth
seemed
calling
to
them
with
all
her
voices
with
memories
sights
and
scents
and
little
sounds
calling
anxiously
as
though
they
had
been
too
long
away
and
must
be
home
soon
they
heard
a
cock
crow
on
the
edge
of
the
night
they
heard
more
little
sounds
than
words
can
say
only
the
organ
can
hint
at
them
it
was
earth
calling
for
talk
as
we
may
of
our
dreams
that
transcend
this
sphere
or
our
hopes
that
build
beyond
it
mother
earth
has
yet
a
mighty
hold
upon
us
and
her
myriad
sounds
were
blending
in
one
cry
now
knowing
that
it
was
late
and
that
these
two
children
of
hers
were
nearly
lost
for
our
spirits
that
sometimes
cross
the
path
of
the
angels
and
on
rare
evenings
hear
a
word
of
their
talk
and
have
brief
equality
with
the
powers
of
light
have
the
duty
also
of
moving
fingers
and
toes
which
freeze
if
our
proud
spirits
forget
their
task
for
too
long
and
just
as
earth
was
despairing
they
reached
the
professor
mountain
and
entered
the
room
in
which
their
bodies
were
blue
and
cold
and
ugly
looked
the
body
of
morano
but
for
all
its
pallor
there
was
beauty
in
the
young
face
of
rodriguez
the
professor
stood
before
them
as
he
had
stood
when
their
spirits
left
with
the
table
between
him
and
the
bodies
and
the
bowl
on
the
table
which
held
the
green
flame
now
low
and
flickering
desperately
which
the
professor
watched
as
it
leaped
and
failed
with
an
air
of
anxiety
that
seemed
to
pinch
his
thin
features
with
an
impatience
strange
to
him
he
waved
a
swift
hand
towards
each
of
the
two
bodies
where
they
sat
stiff
illumined
by
the
last
of
the
green
light
and
at
those
rapid
gestures
the
travellers
returned
to
their
habitations
they
seemed
to
be
just
awakening
out
of
deep
sleep
again
they
saw
the
professor
standing
before
them
but
they
saw
him
only
with
blinking
eyes
they
saw
him
only
as
eyes
can
see
guessing
at
his
mind
from
the
lines
of
his
face
at
his
thoughts
from
the
movements
of
his
hands
guessing
as
men
guess
blindly
only
a
moment
before
they
had
known
him
utterly
now
they
were
dazed
and
forgetting
slow
blood
began
to
creep
again
to
their
toes
and
to
come
again
to
its
place
under
fingernails
it
came
with
intense
pain
they
forgot
their
spirits
then
all
the
woes
of
earth
crowded
their
minds
at
once
so
that
they
wished
to
weep
as
infants
weep
the
professor
gave
this
mood
time
to
change
as
change
it
presently
did
for
the
warm
blood
came
back
and
lit
their
cheeks
and
a
tingling
succeeded
the
pain
in
their
fingers
and
toes
and
a
mild
warmth
succeeded
the
tingling
their
thoughts
came
back
to
the
things
of
every
day
to
mundane
things
and
the
affairs
of
the
body
therein
they
rejoiced
and
morano
no
less
than
rodriguez
though
it
was
a
coarse
and
common
body
that
morano
spirit
inhabited
and
when
the
professor
saw
that
the
first
sorrow
of
earth
which
all
spirits
feel
when
they
land
here
had
passed
away
and
that
they
were
feeling
again
the
joy
of
mundane
things
only
then
did
he
speak
señor
he
said
beyond
the
path
of
mars
run
many
worlds
that
i
would
have
you
know
the
greatest
of
these
is
jupiter
towards
whom
all
that
follow
my
most
sacred
art
show
reverent
affection
the
smallest
are
those
that
sometimes
strike
our
world
flaming
all
green
upon
november
nights
and
are
even
as
small
as
apples
he
spoke
of
our
world
with
a
certain
air
and
a
pride
as
though
through
virtue
of
his
transcendent
art
the
world
were
only
his
the
world
that
we
name
argola
he
said
is
far
smaller
than
spain
and
being
invisible
from
earth
is
only
known
to
the
few
who
have
spoken
to
spirits
whose
wanderings
have
surpassed
the
path
of
mars
nearly
half
of
argola
you
shall
find
covered
with
forests
which
though
very
dense
are
no
deeper
than
moss
and
the
elephants
in
them
are
not
larger
than
beetles
you
shall
see
many
wonders
of
smallness
in
this
world
of
argola
which
i
desire
in
especial
to
show
you
since
it
is
the
orb
with
which
we
who
study
the
art
are
most
familiar
of
all
the
worlds
that
the
vulgar
have
not
known
it
is
indeed
the
prize
of
our
traffic
in
those
things
that
far
transcend
the
laws
that
have
forbidden
them
and
as
he
said
this
the
green
flame
in
the
bowl
before
him
died
and
he
moved
towards
his
cupboard
of
wonder
rodriguez
hastily
thanked
the
professor
for
his
great
courtesy
in
laying
bare
before
him
secrets
that
the
centuries
hid
and
then
he
referred
to
his
own
great
unworthiness
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
the
fatigue
of
the
professor
and
to
the
importance
to
learning
of
adequate
rest
to
refresh
his
illustrious
mind
and
all
that
he
said
the
professor
parried
with
bows
and
drew
enchantments
from
his
cupboard
of
wonder
to
replenish
the
bowl
on
the
table
and
rodriguez
saw
that
he
was
in
the
clutch
of
a
collector
one
who
having
devoted
all
his
days
to
a
hobby
will
exhibit
his
treasures
to
the
uttermost
and
that
the
stars
that
magic
knows
were
no
less
to
the
professor
than
all
the
whatnots
that
a
man
collects
and
insists
on
showing
to
whomsoever
enters
his
house
he
feared
some
terrible
journey
perhaps
some
bare
escape
for
though
no
material
thing
can
quite
encompass
a
spirit
he
knew
not
what
wanderers
he
might
not
meet
in
lonely
spaces
beyond
the
path
of
mars
so
when
his
last
polite
remonstrance
failed
being
turned
aside
with
a
pleasant
phrase
and
a
smile
from
the
grim
lips
and
looking
at
morano
he
saw
that
he
shared
his
fears
then
he
determined
to
show
whatever
resistance
were
needed
to
keep
himself
and
morano
in
this
old
world
that
we
know
or
that
youth
at
least
believes
that
it
knows
he
watched
the
professor
return
with
his
packets
of
wonder
dust
from
a
fallen
star
phials
of
tears
of
lost
lovers
poison
and
gold
out
of
and
all
manner
of
things
but
the
moment
that
he
put
them
into
the
bowl
rodriguez
hand
flew
to
his
he
heaved
up
his
elbow
but
no
sword
came
forth
for
it
lay
magnetised
to
its
scabbard
by
the
grip
of
a
current
of
magic
when
rodriguez
saw
this
he
knew
not
what
to
do
the
professor
went
on
pouring
into
the
bowl
he
added
an
odour
distilled
out
of
three
drops
from
the
of
a
fabulous
beast
and
a
little
dust
that
had
been
man
more
too
he
added
so
that
my
reader
might
wonder
were
i
to
tell
him
all
yet
it
is
not
so
easy
to
free
our
spirits
from
the
gross
grip
of
our
bodies
wonder
not
then
my
reader
if
the
professor
exerted
strange
powers
and
all
the
while
morano
was
picking
at
a
nail
that
fastened
on
the
handle
to
his
and
just
as
the
last
few
mysteries
were
shaken
into
the
bowl
and
there
were
two
among
them
of
which
even
asia
is
ignorant
just
as
the
dews
were
blended
with
the
powers
in
a
sinister
harmony
morano
untwisted
his
nail
and
got
the
handle
loose
the
professor
kindled
the
mixture
in
the
bowl
again
green
flame
arose
again
that
voice
of
his
began
to
call
to
their
spirits
and
its
beauty
and
the
power
of
its
spell
were
as
of
some
fallen
angel
the
spirit
of
rodriguez
was
nearly
passing
helplessly
forth
again
on
some
frightful
journey
when
morano
losed
his
scabbard
and
sword
from
its
girdle
and
tied
the
handle
of
his
across
it
a
little
below
the
hilt
with
a
piece
of
string
across
the
table
the
professor
intoned
his
spell
across
a
narrow
table
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
far
side
of
the
twilight
a
twilight
red
and
golden
in
long
layers
of
an
evening
wonderfully
long
ago
it
seemed
to
take
its
music
out
of
the
lights
that
it
flowed
through
and
to
call
rodriguez
from
immediately
far
away
with
a
call
which
it
were
sacrilege
to
refuse
and
anguish
even
and
hard
toil
such
as
there
was
no
strength
to
do
and
then
morano
held
up
the
sword
in
its
scabbard
with
the
handle
of
the
tied
across
rodriguez
disturbed
by
a
stammer
in
the
spell
looked
up
and
saw
the
professor
staring
at
the
sword
where
morano
held
it
up
before
his
face
in
the
green
light
of
the
flame
from
the
bowl
he
did
not
seem
like
a
fallen
angel
now
his
spell
had
stopped
he
seemed
like
a
professor
who
had
forgotten
the
theme
of
his
lecture
while
the
class
waits
for
morano
was
holding
up
the
sign
of
the
cross
you
have
betrayed
me
shouted
the
slave
of
orion
the
green
flame
died
and
he
strode
out
of
the
room
his
purple
cloak
floating
behind
him
master
morano
said
it
was
always
good
against
magic
the
sword
was
loose
in
the
scabbard
as
rodriguez
took
it
back
there
was
no
longer
a
current
of
magic
gripping
the
steel
a
little
uneasily
rodriguez
thanked
morano
he
was
not
sure
if
morano
had
behaved
as
a
guest
servant
should
but
when
he
thought
of
the
professor
terrible
spells
which
had
driven
them
to
the
awful
crags
of
the
sun
and
might
send
them
who
knows
where
to
with
who
knows
what
his
second
thoughts
perceived
that
morano
was
right
to
cut
short
those
arts
that
the
slave
of
orion
loved
even
by
so
extreme
a
step
and
he
praised
morano
as
his
ready
shrewdness
deserved
we
were
very
nearly
too
late
back
from
that
outing
master
remarked
morano
how
know
you
that
said
rodriguez
this
old
body
knew
said
morano
those
this
warmness
and
all
the
things
that
make
a
fat
body
comfortable
they
were
stopping
master
they
were
spoiling
they
were
getting
cold
and
strange
i
go
no
more
errands
for
that
señor
a
certain
diffidence
about
criticising
his
host
even
now
and
a
very
practical
vein
that
ran
through
his
nature
now
showing
itself
in
anxiety
for
a
bed
at
so
late
an
hour
led
rodriguez
to
change
the
subject
he
wanted
that
aged
butler
yet
dare
not
ring
the
bell
for
he
feared
lest
with
all
the
bells
there
might
be
in
use
that
frightful
practice
that
he
had
met
by
the
outer
door
a
chain
connected
with
some
hideous
hook
that
gave
anguish
to
something
in
the
basement
whenever
one
touched
the
handle
so
that
the
menials
of
that
grim
professor
were
shrilly
summoned
by
screams
and
therefore
rodriguez
sought
counsel
of
morano
who
straightway
volunteered
to
find
the
butler
quarters
by
a
certain
sense
that
he
had
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
forth
he
went
but
would
not
leave
the
room
without
the
scabbard
and
the
handle
of
the
lashed
to
it
which
he
bore
high
before
him
in
both
his
hands
as
though
he
were
leading
some
austere
procession
and
even
so
he
returned
with
that
aged
man
the
butler
who
led
them
down
dim
corridors
of
stone
but
though
he
showed
the
way
morano
would
go
in
front
still
holding
up
that
scabbard
and
handle
before
him
while
rodriguez
held
the
bare
sword
and
so
they
came
to
a
room
lit
by
the
flare
of
one
candle
which
their
guide
told
them
the
professor
had
prepared
for
his
guest
in
the
vastness
of
it
was
a
great
bed
shadows
and
a
whir
as
of
wings
passed
out
of
the
door
as
they
entered
bats
said
the
ancient
guide
but
morano
believed
he
had
routed
powers
of
evil
with
the
handle
of
his
and
his
master
scabbard
who
could
say
what
they
were
in
such
a
house
where
bats
and
evil
spirits
sheltered
perennially
from
the
brooms
of
the
just
then
that
ancient
man
with
the
lips
of
some
woodland
thing
departed
and
rodriguez
went
to
the
great
bed
on
a
pile
of
straw
that
had
been
cast
into
the
room
morano
lay
down
across
the
door
setting
the
scabbard
upright
in
a
near
his
head
while
rodriguez
lay
down
with
the
bare
sword
in
his
hand
there
was
only
one
door
in
the
room
and
this
morano
guarded
windows
there
were
but
they
were
shuttered
with
raw
oak
of
enormous
thickness
he
had
already
enquired
with
his
sword
behind
the
velvet
curtains
he
felt
secure
in
the
bulk
of
morano
across
the
only
door
at
least
from
creatures
of
this
world
and
morano
feared
no
longer
either
spirit
or
spell
believing
that
he
had
vanquished
the
professor
with
his
symbol
and
all
such
allies
as
he
may
have
had
here
or
elsewhere
but
not
thus
easily
do
we
overcome
the
powers
of
evil
a
step
was
heard
such
as
man
walks
with
at
the
close
of
his
later
years
coming
along
the
corridor
of
stone
and
they
knew
it
for
the
professor
butler
returning
the
latch
of
the
door
trembled
and
lifted
and
the
great
oak
door
bumped
slowly
against
morano
who
arose
grumbling
and
the
old
man
appeared
the
professor
he
said
while
morano
watched
him
grudgingly
returns
with
all
his
household
to
saragossa
at
once
to
resume
those
studies
for
which
his
name
resounds
a
certain
conjunction
of
the
stars
having
come
favourably
even
morano
doubted
that
so
suddenly
the
courses
of
the
stars
which
he
deemed
to
be
gradual
should
have
altered
from
antagonism
towards
the
professor
art
into
a
favourable
aspect
rodriguez
sleepily
acknowledged
the
news
and
settled
himself
to
sleep
still
sword
in
hand
when
the
servitor
repeated
with
as
much
emphasis
as
his
aged
voice
could
utter
with
all
his
household
señor
yes
muttered
rodriguez
farewell
and
repeating
again
he
takes
his
household
with
him
the
old
man
shuffled
back
from
the
room
and
hesitatingly
closed
the
door
before
the
sound
of
his
slow
footsteps
had
failed
to
reach
the
room
morano
was
asleep
under
his
cross
rodriguez
still
watched
for
a
while
the
shadows
leaping
and
shuddering
away
from
the
candle
riding
over
the
ceiling
striding
hugely
along
the
walls
towards
him
and
from
him
as
draughts
swayed
the
ruddy
flame
then
gripping
his
sword
still
firmer
in
his
hand
as
though
that
could
avail
against
magic
he
fell
into
the
sleep
of
tired
men
no
sound
disturbed
rodriguez
or
morano
till
both
awoke
in
late
morning
upon
the
rocks
of
the
mountain
the
sun
had
climbed
over
the
crags
and
now
shone
on
their
faces
rodriguez
was
still
lying
with
his
sword
gripped
in
his
hand
but
the
cross
had
fallen
by
morano
and
now
lay
on
the
rocks
beside
him
with
the
handle
of
the
still
tied
in
its
place
by
string
a
young
wild
woodland
squirrel
gambolled
near
though
there
were
no
woods
for
it
anywhere
within
sight
it
leaped
and
played
as
though
rejoicing
in
youth
with
such
merriment
as
though
youth
had
but
come
to
it
newly
or
been
lost
and
restored
again
all
over
the
mountain
they
looked
but
there
was
no
house
nor
any
sign
of
dwelling
of
man
or
spirit
the
fifth
chronicle
how
he
rode
in
the
twilight
and
saw
serafina
rodriguez
who
loved
philosophy
turned
his
mind
at
once
to
the
journey
that
lay
before
him
deciding
which
was
the
north
for
he
knew
that
it
was
by
the
north
that
he
must
leave
spain
which
he
still
desired
to
leave
since
there
were
no
wars
in
that
country
morano
knew
not
clearly
what
philosophy
was
yet
he
wasted
no
thoughts
upon
the
night
that
was
gone
and
fitting
up
his
immediately
he
brought
out
what
was
left
of
his
bacon
and
began
to
look
for
material
to
make
a
fire
the
bacon
lay
waiting
in
the
for
some
while
before
this
material
was
gathered
for
nothing
grew
on
the
mountain
but
a
heath
and
of
that
there
were
few
bushes
scattered
here
and
there
rodriguez
far
from
ruminating
upon
the
events
of
the
previous
night
realised
as
he
watched
these
preparations
that
he
was
enormously
hungry
and
when
morano
had
kindled
a
fire
and
the
smell
of
cooking
arose
he
who
had
held
the
chair
of
magic
at
saragossa
was
banished
from
both
their
minds
although
upon
this
very
spot
they
had
spent
so
strange
a
night
but
where
bacon
is
and
there
be
hungry
men
the
things
of
yesterday
are
often
forgotten
morano
said
rodriguez
we
must
walk
far
indeed
master
said
morano
we
must
push
on
to
these
wars
for
you
have
no
castle
master
no
lands
no
fortune
come
said
rodriguez
morano
slung
his
behind
him
they
had
eaten
up
the
last
of
his
bacon
he
stood
up
and
they
were
ready
for
the
journey
the
smoke
from
their
meagre
fire
went
thinly
into
the
air
the
small
grey
clouds
of
it
went
slowly
up
nothing
beside
remained
to
bid
them
farewell
or
for
them
to
thank
for
their
strange
night
hospitality
they
climbed
till
they
reached
the
rugged
crest
of
the
mountain
thence
they
saw
a
wide
plain
and
the
morning
the
day
was
waiting
for
them
the
northern
slope
of
the
mountain
was
wholly
different
from
that
black
congregation
of
angry
rocks
through
which
they
had
climbed
by
night
to
the
house
of
wonder
the
slope
that
now
lay
before
them
was
smooth
and
grassy
flowing
before
them
far
a
gentle
slope
that
was
soon
to
lend
speed
to
rodriguez
feet
adding
nimbleness
even
to
youth
soon
too
it
was
to
lift
onward
the
dull
weight
of
morano
as
he
followed
his
master
towards
unknown
wars
youth
going
before
him
like
a
spirit
and
the
good
slope
helping
behind
but
before
they
gave
themselves
to
that
waiting
journey
they
stood
a
moment
and
looked
at
the
shining
plain
that
lay
before
them
like
an
open
page
on
which
was
the
whole
chronicle
of
that
wayfaring
there
was
the
road
they
should
travel
by
there
were
the
streams
it
crossed
and
narrow
woods
they
might
rest
in
and
dim
on
the
farthest
edge
was
the
place
they
must
spend
that
night
it
was
all
as
it
were
written
upon
the
plain
they
watched
but
in
a
writing
not
intended
for
them
and
clear
although
it
be
never
to
be
interpreted
by
one
of
our
race
thus
they
saw
clear
from
a
height
the
road
they
would
go
by
but
not
one
of
all
the
events
to
which
it
would
lead
them
master
said
morano
shall
we
have
more
adventures
i
trust
so
said
rodriguez
we
have
far
to
go
and
it
will
be
dull
journeying
without
them
morano
turned
his
eyes
from
his
master
face
and
looked
back
to
the
plain
there
master
he
said
where
our
road
runs
through
a
wood
will
our
adventure
be
there
think
you
or
there
perhaps
and
he
waved
his
hand
widely
farther
no
said
rodriguez
we
pass
that
in
bright
daylight
is
that
not
good
for
adventure
said
morano
the
romances
teach
said
rodriguez
that
twilight
or
night
are
better
the
shade
of
deep
woods
is
favourable
but
there
are
no
such
woods
on
this
plain
when
we
come
to
evening
we
shall
doubtless
meet
some
adventure
far
over
there
and
he
pointed
to
the
grey
rim
of
the
plain
where
it
started
climbing
towards
hills
these
are
good
days
said
morano
he
forgot
how
short
a
time
ago
he
had
said
regretfully
that
these
days
were
not
as
the
old
days
but
our
race
speaking
generally
is
rarely
satisfied
with
the
present
and
morano
cheerfulness
had
not
come
from
his
having
risen
suddenly
superior
to
this
everyday
trouble
of
ours
it
came
from
his
having
shifted
his
gaze
to
the
future
two
things
are
highly
tolerable
to
us
and
even
alluring
the
past
and
the
future
it
was
only
with
the
present
that
morano
was
ever
dissatisfied
when
morano
said
that
the
days
were
good
rodriguez
set
out
to
find
them
or
at
least
that
one
that
for
some
while
now
lay
waiting
for
them
on
the
plain
he
strode
down
the
slope
at
once
and
endowing
nature
with
his
own
impatience
he
felt
that
he
heard
the
morning
call
to
him
wistfully
morano
followed
for
an
hour
these
refugees
escaping
from
peace
went
down
the
slope
and
in
that
hour
they
did
five
swift
miles
miles
that
seemed
to
run
by
them
as
they
walked
and
so
they
came
lightly
to
the
level
plain
and
in
the
next
hour
they
did
four
miles
more
words
were
few
either
because
morano
brooded
mainly
upon
one
thought
the
theme
of
which
was
his
lack
of
bacon
or
because
he
kept
his
breath
to
follow
his
master
who
with
youth
and
the
morning
was
coming
out
of
the
hills
at
a
pace
not
tuned
to
morano
forty
years
or
so
and
at
the
end
of
these
nine
miles
morano
perceived
a
house
a
little
way
from
the
road
on
the
left
upon
rising
ground
a
mile
or
so
ahead
they
saw
the
narrow
wood
that
they
had
viewed
in
the
morning
from
the
mountain
running
across
the
plain
they
saw
now
by
the
lie
of
the
ground
that
it
probably
followed
a
stream
a
pleasant
place
in
which
to
take
the
rest
demanded
by
spain
at
noon
it
was
just
an
hour
to
noon
so
rodriguez
keeping
the
road
told
morano
to
join
him
where
it
entered
the
wood
when
he
had
acquired
his
bacon
and
then
as
they
parted
a
thought
occurred
to
rodriguez
which
was
that
bacon
cost
money
it
was
purely
an
afterthought
an
accidental
fancy
such
as
inspirations
are
for
he
had
never
had
to
buy
bacon
so
he
gave
morano
a
fifth
part
of
his
money
a
large
gold
coin
the
size
of
one
of
our
pieces
engraved
of
course
upon
one
side
with
the
glories
and
honours
of
that
golden
period
of
spain
and
upon
the
other
with
the
head
of
the
lord
the
king
it
was
only
by
chance
he
had
brought
any
at
all
he
was
not
what
our
newspapers
will
call
if
they
ever
care
to
notice
him
a
business
man
at
the
sight
of
the
gold
piece
morano
bowed
for
he
felt
this
gift
of
gold
to
be
an
occasion
but
he
trusted
more
for
the
purchase
of
the
bacon
to
some
few
small
silver
coins
of
his
own
that
he
kept
among
lumps
of
lard
and
pieces
of
string
and
so
they
parted
for
a
while
rodriguez
looking
for
some
great
shadowy
oak
with
moss
under
it
near
a
stream
morano
in
quest
of
bacon
when
rodriguez
entered
the
wood
he
found
his
oak
but
it
was
not
such
an
oak
as
he
cared
to
rest
beneath
during
the
heat
of
the
day
nor
would
you
have
done
so
my
reader
even
though
you
have
been
to
the
wars
and
seen
many
a
pretty
mess
for
four
of
la
garda
were
by
it
and
were
arranging
to
hang
a
man
from
the
best
of
the
branches
la
garda
again
said
rodriguez
nearly
aloud
his
eye
drooped
his
look
was
listless
he
gazed
at
other
things
while
a
glance
that
you
had
not
noticed
flashed
slantingly
at
la
garda
satisfied
rodriguez
that
all
four
were
strangers
then
he
walked
straight
towards
them
merrily
the
man
they
proposed
to
hang
was
a
stranger
too
he
appeared
at
first
to
be
as
stout
as
morano
and
he
was
nearly
half
a
foot
taller
but
his
stoutness
turned
out
to
be
sheer
muscle
the
broad
man
was
clothed
in
old
brown
leather
and
had
blue
eyes
now
there
was
something
about
the
poise
of
rodriguez
young
head
which
gave
him
an
air
not
unlike
that
which
the
king
himself
sometimes
wore
when
he
went
courting
it
suited
his
noble
sword
and
his
merry
plume
when
la
garda
saw
him
they
were
all
politeness
at
once
and
invited
him
to
see
the
hanging
for
which
rodriguez
thanked
them
with
amplest
courtesy
it
is
not
a
said
the
chief
of
la
garda
almost
apologetically
but
rodriguez
waved
aside
his
deprecations
and
declared
himself
charmed
at
the
prospect
of
a
hanging
bear
with
me
reader
while
i
champion
a
bad
cause
and
seek
to
palliate
what
is
inexcusable
as
we
travel
about
the
world
on
our
way
through
life
we
meet
and
pass
here
and
there
in
peace
or
in
war
other
men
and
sometimes
there
is
no
more
than
time
for
a
glance
eye
to
eye
and
in
that
glance
you
see
the
sort
of
man
and
chiefly
there
are
two
sorts
the
one
sort
always
brooding
always
planning
mean
silent
men
collecting
properties
and
money
keeping
the
law
on
their
side
keeping
everything
on
their
side
except
women
and
heaven
and
the
late
leisurely
judgment
of
simple
people
and
the
others
merry
folk
whose
eyes
twinkle
whose
money
flies
who
will
sooner
laugh
than
plan
who
seem
to
inherit
rightfully
the
happiness
that
the
others
plot
for
and
fail
to
come
by
with
all
their
schemes
in
the
man
who
was
to
provide
the
entertainment
rodriguez
recognised
the
second
kind
now
even
though
the
law
had
caught
a
saint
that
had
strayed
too
far
outside
the
boundary
of
heaven
and
desired
to
hang
him
rodriguez
knew
that
it
was
his
duty
to
help
the
law
while
help
was
needed
and
to
applaud
after
the
thing
was
done
the
law
to
rodriguez
was
the
most
sacred
thing
man
had
made
if
indeed
it
were
not
divine
but
since
the
privilege
that
two
days
ago
had
afforded
him
of
studying
it
more
closely
it
appeared
to
him
the
blindest
silliest
thing
with
which
he
had
had
to
do
since
the
kittens
were
drowned
that
his
cat
tabitharina
had
had
at
arguento
harez
it
was
in
this
deplorable
state
of
mind
that
rodriguez
glance
fell
on
the
merry
eyes
and
the
solemn
predicament
of
the
man
in
the
leather
coat
standing
pinioned
under
a
long
branch
of
the
and
he
determined
from
that
moment
to
disappoint
la
garda
and
i
fear
also
my
reader
perhaps
to
disappoint
you
of
the
hanging
that
they
at
least
had
promised
themselves
think
you
said
rodriguez
that
for
so
stout
a
knave
this
branch
of
yours
suffices
now
it
was
an
excellent
branch
but
it
was
not
so
much
rodriguez
words
as
the
anxious
way
in
which
he
looked
at
the
branch
that
aroused
the
anxieties
of
la
garda
and
soon
they
were
looking
about
to
find
a
better
tree
and
when
four
men
start
doing
this
in
a
wood
time
quickly
passes
meanwhile
morano
drew
near
and
rodriguez
went
to
meet
him
master
said
morano
all
out
of
breath
they
had
no
bacon
but
i
got
these
two
bottles
of
wine
it
is
strong
wine
which
is
a
rare
deluder
of
the
senses
which
will
need
to
be
deluded
if
we
are
to
go
hungry
rodriguez
was
about
to
cut
short
morano
chatter
when
he
thought
of
a
use
for
the
wine
and
was
silent
a
moment
and
as
he
pondered
morano
looked
up
and
saw
la
garda
and
at
the
same
time
perceived
the
situation
for
he
had
as
quick
an
eye
for
a
bad
business
as
any
man
no
one
with
the
horses
was
his
comment
for
they
were
tethered
a
little
apart
but
rodriguez
mind
had
already
explored
a
surer
method
than
the
one
that
morano
seemed
to
be
contemplating
this
method
he
told
morano
and
now
from
little
tugs
that
they
were
giving
to
the
doubled
rope
that
hung
over
the
branch
of
the
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
men
of
the
law
were
returning
to
their
confidence
in
that
very
sufficient
branch
they
looked
up
with
questions
ripe
to
drop
from
their
lips
when
they
saw
rodriguez
returning
with
morano
but
before
one
of
them
spoke
morano
flung
to
them
from
far
off
a
little
piece
of
his
wisdom
for
cast
a
truth
into
an
occasion
and
it
will
always
trouble
the
waters
usually
stirring
up
contradiction
but
always
bringing
something
to
the
surface
señores
he
said
no
man
can
enjoy
a
hanging
with
a
dry
throat
thus
he
turned
their
attention
a
while
from
the
business
in
hand
changing
their
thoughts
from
the
stout
neck
of
the
prisoner
to
their
own
throats
wondering
were
they
dry
and
you
do
not
wonder
long
about
this
in
the
south
without
finding
that
what
you
feared
is
true
and
then
he
let
them
see
the
two
great
bottles
all
full
of
wine
for
the
invention
of
the
false
bottom
that
gives
to
our
the
place
they
rightly
hold
among
famous
deceptions
had
not
as
yet
been
discovered
it
is
true
said
la
garda
and
rodriguez
made
morano
put
one
of
the
bottles
away
in
a
piece
of
a
sack
that
he
carried
and
when
la
garda
saw
one
of
the
two
bottles
disappear
it
somehow
decided
them
to
have
the
other
though
how
this
came
to
be
so
there
is
no
saying
and
thus
the
hanging
was
postponed
again
now
the
drink
was
a
yellow
wine
sweet
and
heavy
and
stronger
than
our
port
only
our
whisky
could
it
but
there
in
the
warm
south
it
answered
its
purpose
rodriguez
beckoned
morano
up
and
offered
the
bottle
to
one
of
la
garda
but
scarcely
had
he
put
it
to
his
lips
when
rodriguez
bade
him
stop
saying
that
he
had
had
his
share
and
he
did
the
same
with
the
next
man
now
there
be
few
things
indeed
which
la
garda
resent
more
than
meagre
hospitality
in
the
matter
of
drink
and
with
all
their
wits
striving
to
cope
with
this
vicious
defect
in
rodriguez
as
they
rightly
or
wrongly
regarded
it
how
should
they
have
any
to
spare
for
obvious
precautions
as
the
third
man
drank
rodriguez
turned
to
speak
to
morano
and
the
representative
of
the
law
took
such
advantage
of
an
opportunity
that
he
feared
to
be
fleeting
that
when
rodriguez
turned
round
again
the
bottle
was
just
half
empty
rodriguez
had
timed
it
very
nicely
next
rodriguez
put
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
held
it
there
a
little
time
while
the
fourth
man
of
the
law
who
was
guarding
the
prisoner
watched
rodriguez
wistfully
and
afterwards
morano
who
took
the
bottle
next
yet
neither
rodriguez
nor
morano
drank
you
can
finish
the
bottle
said
rodriguez
to
this
anxious
watcher
who
came
forward
eagerly
though
full
of
doubts
which
changed
to
warm
feelings
of
exuberant
gratitude
when
he
found
how
much
remained
thus
he
obtained
not
much
less
than
two
tumblerfuls
of
wine
that
as
i
have
said
was
stronger
than
port
and
noon
was
nearing
and
it
was
spring
in
spain
and
then
he
returned
to
guard
his
prisoner
under
the
and
lay
down
there
on
the
moss
remembering
that
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
awake
and
afterwards
with
one
hand
he
took
hold
of
a
rope
that
bound
the
prisoner
ankles
so
that
he
might
still
guard
his
prisoner
even
though
he
should
fall
asleep
now
two
of
the
men
had
had
little
more
than
the
full
of
a
sherry
glass
each
to
these
morano
made
signs
that
there
was
another
bottle
and
coming
round
behind
his
master
he
covertly
uncorked
it
and
gave
them
their
heart
desire
and
a
little
was
left
over
for
the
man
who
drank
third
on
the
first
occasion
and
presently
the
spirits
of
all
four
of
la
garda
grew
haughty
and
forgot
their
humble
bodies
and
would
fain
have
gone
forth
to
dwell
with
the
sons
of
light
while
their
bodies
lay
on
the
moss
and
the
sun
grew
warmer
and
warmer
shining
dappled
in
amongst
the
small
green
leaves
all
seemed
still
but
for
the
winged
insects
flashing
through
shafts
of
the
sunlight
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
trees
and
disappearing
again
like
infinitesimal
meteors
but
our
concern
is
with
the
thoughts
of
man
of
which
deeds
are
but
the
shadows
wherever
these
are
active
it
is
wrong
to
say
all
is
still
for
whether
they
cast
their
shadows
which
are
actions
or
whether
they
remain
a
force
not
visibly
stirring
matter
they
are
the
source
of
the
tales
we
write
and
the
lives
we
lead
it
is
they
that
gave
history
her
material
and
they
that
bade
her
work
it
up
into
books
and
thoughts
were
very
active
about
that
for
while
the
thoughts
of
la
garda
arose
like
dawn
and
disappeared
into
mists
their
prisoner
was
silently
living
through
the
sunny
days
of
his
life
which
are
at
no
time
quite
lost
to
us
and
which
flash
vivid
and
bright
and
near
when
memory
touches
them
herself
awakened
by
the
nearness
of
death
he
lived
again
days
far
from
the
day
that
had
brought
him
where
he
stood
he
drew
from
those
days
that
is
to
say
that
delight
that
essence
of
hours
that
something
which
we
call
life
the
sun
the
wind
the
rough
sand
the
splash
of
the
sea
on
the
and
all
the
things
that
it
feels
during
its
span
are
stored
in
something
like
its
memory
and
are
what
we
call
its
life
it
is
the
same
with
all
of
us
life
is
feeling
the
prisoner
from
the
store
of
his
memory
was
taking
all
he
had
his
head
was
lifted
he
was
gazing
northwards
far
further
than
his
eyes
could
see
to
shining
spaces
in
great
woods
and
there
his
threatened
being
walked
in
youth
with
steps
such
as
spirits
take
over
immortal
flowers
which
were
dim
and
faint
but
unfading
because
they
lived
on
in
memory
in
memory
he
walked
with
some
who
were
now
far
from
his
footsteps
and
seen
through
the
gloaming
of
that
perilous
day
how
bright
did
those
far
days
appear
did
they
not
seem
sunnier
than
they
really
were
no
reader
for
all
the
radiance
that
glittered
so
late
in
his
mind
was
drawn
from
those
very
days
it
was
their
own
brightness
that
was
shining
now
we
are
not
done
with
the
days
that
were
as
soon
as
their
sunsets
have
faded
but
a
light
remains
from
them
and
grows
fairer
and
fairer
like
an
afterglow
lingering
among
tremendous
peaks
above
immeasurable
slopes
of
snow
the
prisoner
had
scarcely
noticed
rodriguez
or
his
servant
any
more
than
he
noticed
his
captors
for
there
come
an
intensity
to
those
who
walk
near
death
that
makes
them
a
little
alien
from
other
men
life
flaring
up
in
them
at
the
last
into
so
grand
a
flame
that
the
lives
of
the
others
seem
a
little
cold
and
dim
where
they
dwell
remote
from
that
sunset
that
we
call
mortality
so
he
looked
silently
at
the
days
that
were
as
they
came
dancing
back
again
to
him
from
where
they
had
long
lain
lost
in
chasms
of
time
to
which
they
had
slipped
over
dark
edges
of
years
smiling
they
came
but
all
wistfully
anxious
as
though
their
errand
were
paramount
and
their
span
short
he
saw
them
cluster
about
him
running
now
bringing
their
tiny
gifts
and
scarcely
heard
the
heavy
sigh
of
his
guard
as
rodriguez
gagged
him
and
morano
tied
him
up
had
rodriguez
now
released
the
prisoner
they
could
have
been
three
to
three
in
the
event
of
things
going
wrong
with
the
sleep
of
la
garda
but
since
in
the
same
time
they
could
gag
and
bind
another
the
odds
would
be
the
same
at
two
to
two
and
rodriguez
preferred
this
to
the
slight
uncertainties
that
would
be
connected
with
the
entry
of
another
partner
they
accordingly
gagged
the
next
man
and
bound
his
wrists
and
ankles
and
that
spanish
wine
held
good
with
the
other
two
and
bound
them
far
down
among
the
deeps
of
dreams
and
so
it
should
for
it
was
of
a
vine
that
grew
in
the
vales
of
spain
and
had
ripened
in
one
of
the
years
of
the
golden
age
they
bound
one
as
easily
as
they
had
bound
the
other
two
and
the
last
rodriguez
watched
while
morano
cut
the
ropes
off
the
prisoner
for
he
had
run
out
of
bits
of
twine
and
all
other
improvisations
with
these
ropes
he
ran
back
to
his
master
and
they
tied
up
the
last
prisoner
but
did
not
gag
him
shall
we
gag
him
master
like
the
rest
said
morano
no
said
rodriguez
he
has
nothing
to
say
and
though
this
remark
turned
out
to
be
strictly
untrue
it
well
enough
answered
its
purpose
and
then
they
saw
standing
before
them
the
man
they
had
freed
and
he
bowed
to
rodriguez
like
one
that
had
never
bowed
before
i
do
not
mean
that
he
bowed
with
awkwardness
like
imitative
men
unused
to
politeness
but
he
bowed
as
the
oak
bows
to
the
woodman
he
stood
straight
looking
rodriguez
in
the
eyes
then
he
bowed
as
though
he
had
let
his
spirit
break
which
allowed
him
to
bow
to
never
a
man
before
thus
if
my
pen
has
been
able
dimly
to
tell
of
it
thus
bowed
the
man
in
the
old
leathern
jacket
and
rodriguez
bowed
to
him
in
answer
with
the
elegance
that
they
that
had
dwelt
at
arguento
harez
had
slowly
drawn
from
the
ages
señor
your
name
said
the
stranger
lord
of
arguento
harez
said
rodriguez
señor
he
said
being
a
busy
man
i
have
seldom
time
to
pray
and
the
blessed
saints
being
more
busy
than
i
i
think
seldom
hear
my
prayers
yet
your
name
shall
go
up
to
them
i
will
often
tell
it
them
quietly
in
the
forest
and
not
on
their
holy
days
when
bells
are
ringing
and
loud
prayers
fill
heaven
it
may
be
señor
rodriguez
said
i
profoundly
thank
you
even
in
these
days
when
bullets
are
often
thicker
than
prayers
we
are
not
quite
thankless
for
the
prayers
of
others
in
those
days
they
were
what
closing
quotations
are
on
the
stock
exchange
ink
in
fleet
street
machinery
in
the
midlands
common
but
valued
and
thanks
were
sincere
and
now
that
the
curses
of
the
ungagged
one
of
la
garda
were
growing
monotonous
rodriguez
turned
to
morano
ungag
the
rest
he
said
and
let
them
talk
to
each
other
master
morano
muttered
feeling
that
there
was
enough
noise
already
for
a
small
wood
but
he
went
and
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
rodriguez
was
justified
of
his
humane
decision
for
the
pent
thoughts
of
all
three
found
expression
together
and
all
four
now
talking
at
once
mitigated
any
bitterness
there
may
have
been
in
those
solitary
curses
and
now
rodriguez
could
talk
undisturbed
whither
said
the
stranger
to
the
wars
said
rodriguez
if
wars
there
be
aye
said
the
stranger
there
be
always
wars
somewhere
by
which
road
go
you
north
said
rodriguez
and
he
pointed
the
stranger
turned
his
eyes
to
the
way
rodriguez
pointed
that
brings
you
to
the
forest
he
said
unless
you
go
far
around
as
many
do
what
forest
said
rodriguez
the
great
forest
named
shadow
valley
said
the
stranger
how
far
said
rodriguez
forty
miles
said
the
stranger
rodriguez
looked
at
la
garda
and
then
at
their
horses
and
thought
he
must
be
far
from
la
garda
by
nightfall
it
is
not
easy
to
pass
through
shadow
valley
said
the
stranger
is
it
not
said
rodriguez
have
you
a
gold
great
piece
the
stranger
said
rodriguez
held
out
one
of
his
remaining
four
the
stranger
took
it
and
then
he
began
to
rub
it
on
a
stone
and
continued
to
rub
while
rodriguez
watched
in
silence
until
the
image
of
the
lord
the
king
was
gone
and
the
face
of
the
coin
was
scratchy
and
shiny
and
flat
and
then
he
produced
from
a
pocket
or
pouch
in
his
jacket
a
graving
tool
with
a
round
wooden
handle
which
he
took
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
the
edge
of
the
steel
came
out
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
and
with
this
he
cut
at
the
coin
and
morano
rejoined
them
from
his
merciful
mission
and
stood
and
wondered
at
the
cutting
and
while
he
cut
they
talked
they
did
not
ask
him
how
he
came
to
be
chosen
for
hanging
because
in
every
country
there
are
about
a
hundred
individualists
varying
to
perhaps
half
a
hundred
in
poor
ages
they
go
their
hundred
ways
or
their
ways
and
there
is
a
hundred
and
first
way
or
a
seventh
way
which
is
the
way
that
is
cut
for
the
rest
and
if
some
of
the
rest
catch
one
of
the
hundred
or
one
of
the
six
they
naturally
hang
him
if
they
have
a
rope
and
if
hanging
is
the
custom
of
the
country
for
different
countries
use
different
methods
and
you
saw
by
this
man
eyes
that
he
was
one
of
the
hundred
rodriguez
therefore
only
sought
to
know
how
he
came
to
be
caught
la
garda
found
you
señor
he
said
as
you
see
said
the
stranger
i
came
too
far
from
my
home
you
were
travelling
said
rodriguez
shopping
he
said
at
this
word
morano
interest
awakened
wide
señor
he
said
what
is
the
right
price
for
a
bottle
of
this
wine
that
la
garda
drink
i
know
not
said
the
man
in
the
brown
jacket
they
give
me
these
things
where
is
your
home
señor
rodriguez
asked
it
is
shadow
valley
he
said
one
never
saw
rodriguez
fail
to
understand
anything
if
he
could
not
clear
a
situation
up
he
did
not
struggle
with
it
morano
rubbed
his
chin
he
had
heard
of
shadow
valley
only
dimly
for
all
the
travellers
he
had
known
out
of
the
north
had
gone
round
it
rodriguez
and
morano
bent
their
heads
and
watched
a
design
that
was
growing
out
of
the
gold
and
as
the
design
grew
under
the
hand
of
the
strange
worker
he
began
to
talk
of
the
horses
he
spoke
as
though
his
plans
had
been
clearly
established
by
edict
and
as
though
no
others
could
be
when
i
have
gone
with
two
horses
he
said
ride
hard
with
the
other
two
till
you
reach
the
village
named
lowlight
and
take
them
to
the
forge
of
fernandez
the
smith
where
one
will
shoe
them
who
is
not
fernandez
and
he
waved
his
hand
northwards
there
was
only
one
road
then
all
his
attention
fell
back
again
to
his
work
on
the
gold
coin
and
when
those
blue
eyes
were
turned
away
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
question
and
now
rodriguez
saw
the
design
was
a
crown
a
plain
gold
circlet
with
oak
leaves
rising
up
from
it
and
this
woodland
emblem
stood
up
out
of
the
gold
for
the
worker
had
hollowed
the
coin
away
all
around
it
and
was
sloping
it
up
to
the
edge
little
was
said
by
the
watchers
in
the
wonder
of
seeing
the
work
for
no
craft
is
very
far
from
the
line
beyond
which
is
magic
and
the
man
in
the
leather
coat
was
clearly
a
craftsman
and
he
said
nothing
for
he
worked
at
a
craft
and
when
the
arboreal
crown
was
finished
and
its
edges
were
straight
and
sharp
an
hour
had
passed
since
he
began
near
noon
then
he
drilled
a
hole
near
the
rim
and
drawing
a
thin
green
ribbon
from
his
pocket
he
passed
it
through
the
hole
and
rising
he
suddenly
hung
it
round
rodriguez
neck
wear
it
thus
he
said
while
you
go
through
shadow
valley
as
he
said
this
he
stepped
back
among
the
trees
and
rodriguez
followed
to
thank
him
not
finding
him
behind
the
tree
where
he
thought
to
find
him
he
walked
round
several
others
and
morano
joined
his
search
but
the
stranger
had
vanished
when
they
returned
again
to
the
little
clearing
they
heard
sounds
of
movement
in
the
wood
and
a
little
way
off
where
the
four
horses
had
grazed
there
were
now
only
two
which
were
standing
there
with
their
heads
up
we
must
ride
morano
said
rodriguez
ride
master
said
morano
dolefully
if
we
walk
away
said
rodriguez
they
will
walk
after
us
they
meant
la
garda
it
was
unnecessary
for
him
to
tell
morano
what
i
thus
tell
the
reader
for
in
the
wood
it
was
hard
to
hear
anyone
else
while
to
think
of
anyone
else
was
out
of
the
question
what
shall
i
do
to
them
master
said
morano
they
were
now
standing
close
to
their
captives
and
this
simple
question
calmed
the
four
men
curses
all
of
a
sudden
like
shutting
the
door
on
a
storm
leave
them
rodriguez
said
and
la
garda
spirits
rose
and
they
cursed
again
ah
to
die
in
the
wood
said
morano
no
said
rodriguez
and
he
walked
towards
the
horses
and
something
in
that
no
sounding
almost
contemptuous
morano
feelings
were
hurt
and
he
blurted
out
to
his
master
but
how
can
they
get
away
to
get
their
food
it
is
good
knots
that
i
tie
master
morano
rodriguez
said
i
remember
ten
ways
in
the
books
of
romance
whereby
bound
men
untie
themselves
and
doubtless
one
or
two
more
i
have
read
and
forgot
and
there
may
be
other
ways
in
the
books
that
i
have
not
read
besides
any
way
that
there
be
of
which
no
books
tell
and
in
addition
to
these
ways
one
of
them
may
draw
a
comrade
sword
with
his
teeth
and
thus
shall
i
pull
out
their
teeth
said
morano
ride
said
rodriguez
for
they
were
now
come
to
the
horses
and
sorrowfully
morano
looked
at
the
horse
that
was
to
be
his
as
a
man
might
look
at
a
small
uncomfortable
boat
that
is
to
carry
him
far
upon
a
stormy
day
and
then
rodriguez
helped
him
into
the
saddle
can
you
stay
there
rodriguez
said
we
have
far
to
go
master
morano
answered
these
hands
can
hold
till
evening
and
then
rodriguez
mounted
leaving
morano
gripping
the
high
front
of
the
saddle
with
his
large
brown
hands
but
as
soon
as
the
horses
started
he
got
a
grip
with
his
heels
as
well
and
later
on
with
his
knees
rodriguez
led
the
way
on
to
the
straggling
road
and
was
soon
galloping
northwards
while
morano
heels
kept
his
horse
up
close
to
his
master
morano
rode
as
though
trained
in
the
same
school
that
some
while
later
taught
macaulay
equestrian
who
rode
with
loose
rein
and
bloody
spur
yet
the
miles
went
swiftly
by
as
they
galloped
on
soft
white
dust
which
lifted
and
settled
some
of
it
back
on
the
lazy
road
while
some
of
it
was
breathed
by
morano
the
gold
coin
on
the
green
silk
ribbon
flapped
up
and
down
as
rodriguez
rode
till
he
stuffed
it
inside
his
clothing
and
remembered
no
more
about
it
once
they
saw
before
them
the
man
they
had
snatched
from
the
noose
he
was
going
hard
and
leading
a
loose
horse
and
then
where
the
road
bent
round
a
low
hill
he
galloped
out
of
sight
and
they
saw
him
no
more
he
had
the
loose
horse
to
change
on
to
as
soon
as
the
other
was
tired
they
had
no
prospect
of
overtaking
him
and
so
he
passed
out
of
their
minds
as
their
host
had
done
who
went
away
with
his
household
to
saragossa
at
first
rodriguez
mandolin
that
was
always
slung
on
his
back
bumped
up
and
down
uncomfortably
but
he
eased
it
by
altering
the
strap
small
things
like
this
bring
contentment
and
then
he
settled
down
to
ride
but
no
contentment
came
near
morano
nor
did
he
look
for
it
on
the
first
day
of
his
wanderings
he
had
worn
his
master
clothes
which
has
been
an
experience
standing
somewhat
where
toothache
does
which
is
somewhere
about
between
discomfort
and
agony
on
the
second
day
he
had
climbed
at
the
end
of
a
weary
journey
over
those
sharp
rocks
whose
shape
was
adapted
so
ill
to
his
body
on
the
third
day
he
was
riding
he
did
not
look
for
comfort
but
he
met
discomfort
with
an
easy
resignation
that
almost
defeated
the
intention
of
satan
who
sends
it
unless
as
is
very
likely
it
be
from
heaven
and
in
spite
of
all
discomforts
he
gaily
followed
rodriguez
in
a
thousand
days
at
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
no
two
were
so
different
to
morano
that
one
stood
out
from
the
other
or
any
from
the
rest
it
was
all
as
though
one
day
were
repeated
again
and
again
and
at
some
point
in
this
monotonous
repetition
like
a
milestone
shaped
as
the
rest
on
a
perfectly
featureless
road
life
would
end
and
the
meaningless
repetition
stop
and
looking
back
on
it
there
would
only
be
one
day
to
see
or
if
he
could
not
look
back
it
would
be
all
gone
for
nothing
and
then
into
that
one
day
that
he
was
living
on
in
the
gloaming
of
that
grim
inn
rodriguez
had
appeared
and
morano
had
known
him
for
one
of
those
wandering
lights
that
sometimes
make
sudden
day
among
the
stars
he
knew
no
he
felt
that
by
following
him
yesterday
today
and
tomorrow
would
be
three
separate
possessions
in
memory
morano
gladly
gave
up
that
one
dull
day
he
was
living
for
the
new
strange
days
through
which
rodriguez
was
sure
to
lead
him
gladly
he
left
it
if
this
be
not
true
how
then
has
a
man
with
a
dream
led
thousands
to
follow
his
fancy
from
the
crusades
to
whatever
gay
madness
be
the
fashion
when
this
is
read
as
they
galloped
the
scent
of
the
flowers
rushed
into
rodriguez
nostrils
while
morano
mainly
breathed
the
dust
from
the
hooves
of
his
master
horse
but
the
quest
was
favoured
the
more
by
the
scent
of
the
flowers
inspiring
its
leader
fancies
so
morano
gained
even
from
this
in
the
first
hour
they
shortened
by
fifteen
miles
the
length
of
their
rambling
quest
in
the
next
hour
they
did
five
miles
and
in
the
third
hour
ten
after
this
they
rode
slowly
the
sun
was
setting
morano
regarded
the
sunset
with
delight
for
it
seemed
to
promise
jovially
the
end
of
his
sufferings
which
except
for
brief
periods
when
they
went
on
foot
to
rest
as
rodriguez
said
the
horses
had
been
continuous
and
even
increasing
since
they
started
rodriguez
perhaps
a
little
weary
too
drew
from
the
sunset
a
more
sombre
feeling
as
sensitive
minds
do
he
responded
to
its
farewell
he
felt
its
beauty
and
as
little
winds
turned
cool
and
the
shine
of
blades
of
grass
faded
making
all
the
plain
dimmer
he
heard
or
believed
he
heard
further
off
than
he
could
see
sounds
on
the
plain
beyond
ridges
in
hollows
behind
clumps
of
bushes
as
though
small
creatures
all
unknown
to
his
learning
played
instruments
cut
from
reeds
upon
unmapped
streams
in
this
hour
among
these
fancies
rodriguez
saw
clear
on
a
hill
the
white
walls
of
the
village
of
lowlight
and
now
they
began
to
notice
that
a
great
round
moon
was
shining
the
sunset
grew
dimmer
and
the
moonlight
stole
in
softly
as
a
cat
might
walk
through
great
doors
on
her
silent
feet
into
a
just
as
the
king
had
gone
and
they
entered
the
village
slowly
in
the
perfect
moment
of
twilight
the
round
horizon
was
brimming
with
a
pale
but
magical
colour
welling
up
to
the
tips
of
trees
and
the
battlements
of
white
towers
earth
seemed
a
mysterious
cup
overfull
of
this
pigment
of
wonder
clouds
wandering
low
straying
far
from
their
azure
fields
were
dipped
in
it
the
towers
of
lowlight
turned
slowly
rose
in
that
light
and
glowed
together
with
the
infinite
gloaming
so
that
for
this
brief
hour
the
things
of
man
were
wed
with
the
things
of
eternity
it
was
into
this
wide
pale
flame
of
aetherial
rose
that
the
moon
came
stealing
like
a
magician
on
to
enchant
the
tips
of
the
trees
low
clouds
and
the
towers
of
lowlight
a
blue
light
from
beyond
our
world
touched
the
pink
that
is
earth
at
evening
and
what
was
strange
and
a
matter
for
hushed
voices
marvellous
but
yet
of
our
earth
became
at
that
touch
unearthly
all
in
a
moment
it
was
and
rodriguez
gasped
to
see
it
even
morano
eyes
grew
round
with
the
coming
of
wonder
or
with
some
dim
feeling
that
an
unnoticed
moment
had
made
all
things
strange
and
new
for
some
moments
the
spell
of
moonlight
on
sunlight
hovered
the
air
was
brimming
and
quivering
with
it
magic
touched
earth
for
some
moments
some
thirty
beats
of
a
heron
wing
had
the
angels
sung
to
men
had
their
songs
gone
earthward
into
that
rosy
glow
gliding
past
layers
of
faintly
tinted
cloud
like
moths
at
dusk
towards
a
in
those
few
moments
men
would
have
known
their
language
rodriguez
reined
in
his
horse
in
the
heavy
silence
and
waited
for
what
he
waited
he
knew
not
some
unearthly
answer
perhaps
to
his
questioning
thoughts
that
had
wandered
far
from
earth
though
no
words
came
to
him
with
which
to
ask
their
question
and
he
did
not
know
what
question
they
would
ask
he
was
all
vibrating
with
the
human
longing
i
know
not
what
it
is
but
perhaps
philosophers
know
he
sat
there
waiting
while
a
late
bird
sailed
homeward
sat
while
morano
wondered
and
nothing
spake
from
anywhere
and
now
a
dog
began
to
notice
the
moon
now
a
child
cried
suddenly
that
had
been
dragged
back
from
the
street
where
it
had
wandered
at
bedtime
an
old
dog
rose
from
where
it
had
lain
in
the
sun
and
feebly
yet
confidently
scratched
at
a
door
a
cat
peered
round
a
corner
a
man
spoke
rodriguez
knew
there
would
be
no
answer
now
rodriguez
hit
his
horse
the
tired
animal
went
forward
and
he
and
morano
rode
slowly
up
the
street
dona
serafina
of
the
valley
of
dawnlight
had
left
the
heat
of
the
room
that
looked
on
the
fields
and
into
which
the
sun
had
all
day
been
streaming
and
had
gone
at
sunset
to
sit
in
the
balcony
that
looked
along
the
street
often
she
would
do
this
at
sunset
but
she
rather
dreamed
as
she
sat
there
than
watched
the
street
for
all
that
it
had
to
show
she
knew
without
glancing
evening
after
evening
as
soon
as
winter
was
over
the
neighbour
would
come
from
next
door
and
stretch
himself
and
yawn
and
sit
on
a
chair
by
his
doorway
and
the
neighbour
from
opposite
would
saunter
across
the
way
to
him
and
they
would
talk
with
eagerness
of
the
sale
of
cattle
and
sometimes
but
more
coldly
of
the
affairs
of
kings
she
knew
but
cared
not
to
know
just
when
the
two
old
men
would
begin
their
talk
she
knew
who
owned
every
dog
that
stretched
itself
in
the
dust
until
chilly
winds
blew
in
the
dusk
and
they
rose
up
dissatisfied
she
knew
the
affairs
of
that
street
like
an
old
old
lesson
taught
drearily
and
her
thoughts
went
far
away
to
vales
of
an
imagination
where
they
met
with
many
another
maiden
fancy
and
they
all
danced
there
together
through
the
long
twilight
in
spring
and
then
her
mother
would
come
and
warn
her
that
the
evening
grew
cold
and
serafina
would
turn
from
the
mystery
of
evening
into
the
house
and
the
this
was
so
evening
after
evening
all
through
spring
and
summer
for
two
long
years
of
her
youth
and
then
this
evening
just
as
the
two
old
neighbours
began
to
discuss
whether
or
not
the
subjugation
of
the
entire
world
by
spain
would
be
for
its
benefit
just
as
one
of
the
dogs
in
the
road
was
rising
slowly
to
shake
itself
neighbours
and
dogs
all
raised
their
heads
to
look
and
there
was
rodriguez
riding
down
the
street
and
morano
coming
behind
him
when
serafina
saw
this
she
brought
her
eyes
back
from
dreams
for
she
dreamed
not
so
deeply
but
that
the
cloak
and
plume
of
rodriguez
found
some
place
upon
the
boundaries
of
her
when
she
saw
the
way
he
sat
his
horse
and
how
he
carried
his
head
she
let
her
eyes
flash
for
a
little
moment
along
the
street
from
her
balcony
and
if
some
critical
reader
ask
how
she
did
it
i
answer
my
good
sir
i
ca
tell
you
because
i
do
know
or
my
dear
lady
what
a
question
to
ask
and
where
she
learned
to
do
it
i
can
not
think
but
nothing
was
easier
and
then
she
smiled
to
think
that
she
had
done
the
very
thing
that
her
mother
had
warned
her
there
was
danger
in
doing
serafina
her
mother
said
in
that
moment
at
the
large
window
the
evening
grows
cold
it
might
be
dangerous
to
stay
there
longer
and
serafina
entered
the
house
as
she
had
done
at
the
coming
of
dusk
on
many
an
evening
rodriguez
missed
as
much
of
that
flash
of
her
eyes
shot
from
below
the
darkness
of
her
hair
as
youth
in
its
first
glory
and
freedom
misses
for
at
the
point
on
the
road
called
life
at
which
rodriguez
was
then
one
is
high
on
a
crag
above
the
promontories
of
watchmen
lower
only
than
the
peaks
of
the
prophets
from
which
to
see
such
things
yet
it
did
not
need
youth
to
notice
serafina
beggars
had
blessed
her
for
the
poise
of
her
head
she
turned
that
head
a
little
as
she
went
between
the
windows
till
rodriguez
gazing
up
to
her
saw
the
fair
shape
of
her
neck
and
almost
in
that
moment
the
last
of
the
daylight
died
the
windows
shut
and
rodriguez
rode
on
with
morano
to
find
the
forge
that
was
kept
by
fernandez
the
smith
and
presently
they
came
to
the
village
forge
a
cottage
with
huge
high
roof
whose
beams
were
safe
from
sparks
and
its
fire
was
glowing
redly
into
the
moonlight
through
the
wide
door
made
for
horses
although
there
seemed
no
work
to
be
done
and
a
man
with
a
swart
moustache
was
piling
more
logs
on
over
the
door
was
burned
on
oak
in
ungainly
great
letters
fernandez
for
whom
do
you
seek
señor
he
said
to
rodriguez
who
had
halted
before
him
with
his
horse
nose
inside
the
doorway
sniffing
i
look
he
said
for
him
who
is
not
fernandez
i
am
he
said
the
man
by
the
fire
rodriguez
questioned
no
further
but
dismounted
and
bade
morano
lead
the
horses
in
and
then
he
saw
in
the
dark
at
the
back
of
the
forge
the
other
two
horses
that
he
had
seen
in
the
wood
and
they
were
shod
as
he
had
never
seen
horses
shod
before
for
the
front
pair
of
shoes
were
joined
by
a
chain
riveted
stoutly
to
each
and
the
hind
pair
also
and
both
horses
were
shod
alike
the
method
was
equally
new
to
morano
and
now
the
man
with
the
swart
moustache
picked
up
another
bunch
of
horseshoes
hanging
in
pairs
on
chains
and
rodriguez
was
not
far
out
when
he
guessed
that
whenever
la
garda
overtook
their
horses
they
would
find
that
fernandez
was
far
away
making
holiday
while
he
who
shod
them
now
would
be
gone
upon
other
business
and
all
this
work
seemed
to
rodriguez
not
to
be
his
affair
farewell
he
said
to
the
smith
that
was
not
fernandez
and
with
a
pat
for
his
horse
he
left
it
having
obtained
a
promise
of
oats
and
so
rodriguez
and
morano
went
on
foot
again
morano
elated
in
spite
of
fatigue
and
pain
rejoicing
to
feel
the
earth
once
more
flat
under
the
soles
of
his
feet
rodriguez
a
little
humbled
the
sixth
chronicle
how
he
sang
to
his
mandolin
and
what
came
of
his
singing
they
walked
back
slowly
in
silence
up
the
street
down
which
they
had
ridden
earth
darkened
the
moon
grew
brighter
and
rodriguez
gazing
at
the
pale
golden
disk
began
to
wonder
who
dwelt
in
the
lunar
valleys
and
what
message
if
folk
were
there
they
had
for
our
peoples
and
in
what
language
such
message
could
ever
be
and
how
it
could
fare
across
that
limpid
remoteness
that
wafted
light
on
to
the
coasts
of
earth
and
lapped
in
silence
on
the
lunar
shores
and
as
he
wondered
he
thought
of
his
mandolin
morano
he
said
buy
bacon
morano
eyes
brightened
they
were
miles
from
the
hills
on
which
he
had
last
tasted
bacon
he
selected
his
house
with
a
glance
and
then
he
was
gone
and
rodriguez
reflected
too
late
that
he
had
forgotten
to
tell
morano
where
he
should
find
him
and
this
with
night
coming
on
in
a
strange
village
scarcely
rodriguez
reflected
he
knew
where
he
was
going
himself
yet
if
old
tunes
lurking
in
its
hollows
echoing
though
imperceptibly
from
evenings
gave
the
mandolin
any
knowledge
of
human
affairs
that
other
inanimate
things
can
not
possess
the
mandolin
knew
let
us
in
fancy
call
up
the
shade
of
morano
from
that
far
generation
let
us
ask
him
where
rodriguez
is
going
those
blue
eyes
dim
with
the
distance
over
which
our
fancy
has
called
them
look
in
our
eyes
with
wonder
i
do
not
know
he
says
where
don
rodriguez
is
going
my
master
did
not
tell
me
did
he
notice
nothing
as
they
rode
by
that
balcony
nothing
morano
answers
except
my
master
riding
we
may
let
morano
shade
drift
hence
again
for
we
shall
discover
nothing
nor
is
this
an
age
to
which
to
call
back
spirits
rodriguez
strolled
slowly
on
the
deep
dust
of
that
street
as
though
wondering
all
the
while
where
he
should
go
and
soon
he
and
his
mandolin
were
below
that
very
balcony
whereon
he
had
seen
the
white
neck
of
serafina
gleam
with
the
last
of
the
daylight
and
now
the
spells
of
the
moon
charmed
earth
with
their
full
power
the
balcony
was
empty
how
should
it
have
been
otherwise
and
yet
rodriguez
grieved
for
between
the
vision
that
had
drawn
his
footsteps
and
that
bare
balcony
below
shuttered
windows
was
the
difference
between
a
haven
sought
over
leagues
of
sea
and
sheer
uncharted
cliff
it
brought
a
wistfulness
into
the
music
he
played
and
a
melancholy
that
was
all
new
to
rodriguez
yet
often
and
often
before
had
that
mandolin
sent
up
through
evening
against
unheeding
space
that
cry
that
man
can
not
utter
for
the
spirit
of
man
needs
a
mandolin
as
a
comrade
to
face
the
verdict
of
the
chilly
stars
as
he
needs
a
bulldog
for
more
mundane
things
soon
out
of
the
depth
of
that
stout
old
mandolin
in
which
so
many
human
sorrows
had
spun
tunes
out
of
themselves
as
the
spiders
spin
misty
grey
webs
till
it
was
all
haunted
with
music
soon
the
old
cry
went
up
to
the
stars
again
a
thread
of
supplication
spun
of
the
matter
which
else
were
distilled
in
tears
beseeching
it
knew
not
what
and
but
that
fate
is
deaf
all
that
man
asks
in
music
had
been
granted
then
what
sorrows
had
rodriguez
known
in
his
life
that
he
made
so
sad
a
melody
i
know
not
it
was
the
mandolin
when
the
mandolin
was
made
it
knew
at
once
all
the
sorrows
of
man
and
all
the
old
unnamed
longings
that
none
defines
it
knew
them
as
the
dog
knows
the
alliance
that
its
forefathers
made
with
man
a
mandolin
weeps
the
tears
that
its
master
can
not
shed
or
utters
the
prayers
that
are
deeper
than
its
lips
can
draw
as
a
dog
will
fight
for
his
master
with
teeth
that
are
longer
than
man
and
if
the
moonlight
streamed
on
untroubled
and
though
fate
was
deaf
yet
beauty
of
those
fresh
strains
going
starward
from
under
his
fingers
touched
at
least
the
heart
of
rodriguez
and
gilded
his
dreams
and
gave
to
his
thoughts
a
mournful
autumnal
glory
until
he
sang
all
newly
as
he
never
had
sung
before
with
limpid
voice
along
the
edge
of
tears
a
old
as
the
woods
of
his
valleys
at
whose
edge
he
had
heard
it
once
drift
through
the
evening
and
as
he
played
and
sang
with
his
young
soul
in
the
music
he
fancied
and
why
not
if
they
care
aught
for
our
souls
in
heaven
he
fancied
the
angles
putting
their
hands
each
one
on
a
star
and
leaning
out
of
heaven
through
the
constellations
to
listen
a
vile
song
señor
and
a
vile
tune
with
it
said
a
voice
quite
close
however
much
the
words
hurt
his
pride
in
his
mandolin
rodriguez
recognised
in
the
voice
the
hidalgo
accent
and
knew
that
it
was
an
equal
that
now
approached
him
in
the
moonlight
round
a
corner
of
the
house
with
the
balcony
and
he
knew
that
the
request
he
courteously
made
would
be
as
courteously
granted
señor
he
said
i
pray
you
to
permit
me
to
lean
my
mandolin
against
the
wall
securely
before
we
speak
of
my
song
most
surely
señor
the
stranger
replied
for
there
is
no
fault
with
the
mandolin
señor
rodriguez
said
i
thank
you
profoundly
and
he
bowed
to
the
gallant
whom
he
now
perceived
to
be
young
a
youth
tall
and
lithe
like
himself
one
whom
we
might
have
chosen
for
these
chronicles
had
we
not
found
rodriguez
then
rodriguez
stepped
back
a
short
way
and
placed
his
kerchief
on
the
ground
and
upon
this
he
put
his
mandolin
and
leaned
it
against
the
wall
when
the
mandolin
was
safe
from
dust
or
accident
he
approached
the
stranger
and
drew
his
sword
señor
he
said
we
will
now
discuss
music
right
gladly
señor
said
the
young
man
who
now
drew
his
sword
also
there
were
no
clouds
the
moon
was
full
the
evening
promised
well
scarcely
had
the
flash
of
thin
rapiers
crossing
each
other
by
moonlight
begun
to
gleam
in
the
street
when
morano
appeared
beside
them
and
stood
there
watching
he
had
bought
his
bacon
and
gone
straight
to
the
house
with
the
balcony
for
though
he
knew
no
latin
he
had
not
missed
the
silent
greeting
that
had
welcomed
his
master
to
that
village
or
failed
to
interpret
the
gist
of
the
words
that
rodriguez
dumb
glance
would
have
said
he
stood
there
watching
while
each
combatant
stood
his
ground
and
rodriguez
remembered
all
those
passes
and
feints
that
he
had
had
from
his
father
and
which
sevastiani
a
master
of
arms
in
madrid
had
taught
in
his
father
youth
and
some
were
famous
and
some
were
little
known
and
all
these
passes
as
he
tried
them
one
by
one
his
unknown
antagonist
parried
and
for
a
moment
rodriguez
feared
that
morano
would
see
those
passes
in
which
he
trusted
foiled
by
that
unknown
sword
and
then
he
reflected
that
morano
knew
nothing
of
the
craft
of
the
rapier
and
with
more
content
at
that
thought
he
parried
thrusts
that
were
strange
to
him
but
something
told
morano
that
in
this
fight
the
stranger
was
master
and
that
along
that
moonlit
unknown
sword
lurked
a
sure
death
for
rodriguez
he
moved
from
his
place
of
vantage
and
was
soon
lost
in
large
shadows
while
the
rapiers
played
and
blade
rippled
on
blade
with
a
sound
as
though
death
were
gently
sharpening
his
scythe
in
the
dark
and
now
rodriguez
was
giving
ground
now
his
antagonist
pressed
him
thrusts
that
he
believed
invincible
had
failed
now
he
parried
wearily
and
had
at
once
to
parry
again
the
unknown
pressed
on
was
upon
him
was
scattering
his
weakening
parries
drew
back
his
rapier
for
a
deadlier
pass
learned
in
a
secret
school
in
a
hut
on
mountains
he
knew
and
practised
surely
and
fell
in
a
heap
upon
rodriguez
feet
struck
full
on
the
back
of
the
head
by
most
vile
knave
shouted
rodriguez
as
he
saw
morano
before
him
with
his
in
his
hand
and
with
something
of
the
stupid
expression
that
you
see
on
the
face
of
a
dog
that
has
done
some
foolish
thing
which
it
thinks
will
delight
its
master
master
i
am
your
servant
said
morano
vile
miserable
knave
replied
rodriguez
master
morano
said
plaintively
shall
i
see
to
your
comforts
your
food
and
not
to
your
life
silence
thundered
rodriguez
as
he
stooped
anxiously
to
his
antagonist
who
was
not
unconscious
but
only
very
giddy
and
who
now
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
help
of
rodriguez
alas
señor
said
rodriguez
the
foul
knave
is
my
servant
he
shall
be
flogged
he
shall
be
flayed
his
vile
flesh
shall
be
cut
off
him
does
the
hurt
pain
you
señor
sit
and
rest
while
i
beat
the
knave
and
then
we
will
continue
our
meeting
and
he
ran
to
his
kerchief
on
which
rested
his
mandolin
and
laid
it
upon
the
dust
for
the
stranger
no
no
said
he
my
head
clears
again
it
is
nothing
but
rest
señor
rest
said
rodriguez
it
is
always
well
to
rest
before
an
encounter
rest
while
i
punish
the
knave
and
he
led
him
to
where
the
kerchief
lay
on
the
ground
let
me
see
the
hurt
señor
he
continued
and
the
stranger
removed
his
plumed
hat
as
rodriguez
compelled
him
to
sit
down
he
straightened
out
the
hat
as
he
sat
and
the
hurt
was
shown
to
be
of
no
great
consequence
the
blessed
saints
be
praised
rodriguez
said
it
need
not
stop
our
encounter
but
rest
awhile
señor
indeed
it
is
nothing
he
answered
but
the
indignity
is
immeasurable
sighed
rodriguez
would
you
care
señor
when
you
are
well
rested
to
give
the
chastisement
yourself
as
far
as
that
goes
said
the
stranger
i
can
chastise
him
now
if
you
are
fully
recovered
señor
rodriguez
said
my
own
sword
is
at
your
disposal
to
beat
him
sore
with
the
flat
of
it
or
how
you
will
thus
no
dishonour
shall
touch
your
sword
from
the
skin
of
so
vile
a
knave
the
stranger
smiled
the
idea
appealed
to
him
you
make
a
noble
amend
señor
he
said
as
he
bowed
over
proffered
sword
morano
had
not
moved
far
but
stood
near
wondering
what
should
a
servant
do
if
not
work
for
his
master
he
wondered
and
how
work
for
him
when
dead
and
dead
as
it
seemed
to
morano
through
his
own
fault
if
he
allowed
any
man
to
kill
him
when
he
perceived
him
about
to
do
so
he
stood
there
puzzled
and
suddenly
he
saw
the
stranger
coming
angrily
towards
him
in
the
clear
moonlight
with
a
sword
morano
was
frightened
as
the
hidalgo
came
up
to
him
he
stretched
out
his
left
hand
to
seize
morano
by
the
shoulder
up
went
the
the
stranger
parried
but
against
a
stroke
that
no
school
taught
or
knew
and
for
the
second
time
he
went
down
in
the
dust
with
a
reeling
head
rodriguez
turned
toward
morano
and
said
to
him
no
realism
is
all
very
well
and
i
know
that
my
duty
as
author
is
to
tell
all
that
happened
and
i
could
win
mighty
praise
as
a
bold
unconventional
writer
at
the
same
time
some
young
lady
will
be
reading
all
this
next
year
in
some
far
country
or
in
twenty
years
in
england
and
i
would
sooner
she
should
not
read
what
rodriguez
said
i
do
not
i
trust
disappoint
her
but
the
gist
of
it
was
that
he
should
leave
that
place
now
and
depart
from
his
service
for
ever
and
hearing
those
words
morano
turned
mournfully
away
and
was
at
once
lost
in
the
darkness
while
rodriguez
ran
once
more
to
help
his
fallen
antagonist
señor
señor
he
said
with
an
emotion
that
some
wearing
centuries
and
a
cold
climate
have
taught
us
not
to
show
and
beyond
those
words
he
could
find
no
more
to
say
giddy
only
giddy
said
the
stranger
a
tear
fell
on
his
forehead
as
rodriguez
helped
him
to
his
feet
señor
rodriguez
said
fervently
we
will
finish
our
encounter
come
what
may
the
knave
is
gone
and
but
i
am
somewhat
giddy
said
the
other
i
will
take
off
one
of
my
shoes
said
rodriguez
leaving
the
other
on
it
will
equalise
our
unsteadiness
and
you
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
our
encounter
come
he
added
kindly
i
can
not
see
so
clearly
as
before
the
young
hidalgo
murmured
i
will
bandage
my
right
eye
also
said
rodriguez
and
if
this
can
not
equalise
it
it
is
a
most
fair
offer
said
the
young
man
i
could
not
bear
that
you
should
be
disappointed
of
your
encounter
rodriguez
said
by
this
spirit
of
hell
that
has
got
itself
clothed
in
fat
and
dares
to
usurp
the
dignity
of
man
it
is
a
right
fair
offer
the
young
man
said
again
rest
yourself
señor
said
rodriguez
while
i
take
off
my
shoe
and
he
indicated
his
kerchief
which
was
still
on
the
ground
the
stranger
sat
down
a
little
wearily
and
rodriguez
sitting
upon
the
dust
took
off
his
left
shoe
and
now
he
began
to
think
a
little
wistfully
of
the
face
that
had
shone
from
that
balcony
where
all
was
dark
now
in
black
shadow
unlit
by
the
moon
the
emptiness
of
the
balcony
and
its
darkness
oppressed
him
for
he
could
scarcely
hope
to
survive
an
encounter
with
that
swordsman
whose
skill
he
now
recognised
as
being
of
a
different
class
from
his
own
a
class
of
which
he
knew
nothing
all
his
own
feints
and
passes
were
known
while
those
of
his
antagonist
had
been
strange
and
new
and
he
might
well
have
even
others
the
stranger
giddiness
did
not
alter
the
situation
for
rodriguez
knew
that
his
handicap
was
fair
and
even
generous
he
believed
he
was
near
his
grave
and
could
see
no
spark
of
light
to
banish
that
dark
belief
yet
more
chances
than
we
can
see
often
guard
us
on
such
occasions
the
absence
of
serafina
saddened
him
like
a
sorrowful
sunset
rodriguez
rose
and
limped
with
his
one
shoe
off
to
the
stranger
who
was
sitting
upon
his
kerchief
i
will
bandage
my
right
eye
now
señor
he
said
the
young
man
rose
and
shook
the
dust
from
the
kerchief
and
gave
it
to
rodriguez
with
a
renewed
expression
of
his
gratitude
at
the
fairness
of
the
strange
handicap
when
rodriguez
had
bandaged
his
eye
the
stranger
returned
his
sword
to
him
which
he
had
held
in
his
hand
since
his
effort
to
beat
morano
and
drawing
his
own
stepped
back
a
few
paces
from
him
rodriguez
took
one
hopeless
look
at
the
balcony
saw
it
as
empty
and
as
black
as
ever
then
he
faced
his
antagonist
waiting
bandage
one
eye
indeed
muttered
morano
as
he
stepped
up
behind
the
stranger
and
knocked
him
down
for
the
third
time
with
a
blow
over
the
head
from
his
the
young
hidalgo
dropped
silently
rodriguez
uttered
one
scream
of
anger
and
rushed
at
morano
with
his
sword
morano
had
already
started
to
run
and
knowing
well
that
he
was
running
for
his
life
he
kept
for
awhile
the
start
that
he
had
of
the
rapier
rodriguez
knew
that
no
plump
man
of
over
forty
could
last
against
his
lithe
speed
long
he
saw
morano
clearly
before
him
then
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
moment
and
ran
confidently
on
pursuing
he
ran
on
and
on
and
at
last
he
recognised
that
morano
had
slipped
into
the
darkness
which
lies
always
so
near
to
the
moonlight
and
was
not
in
front
of
him
at
all
so
he
returned
to
his
fallen
antagonist
and
found
him
breathing
heavily
where
he
fell
scarcely
conscious
the
third
stroke
of
the
had
done
its
work
surely
rodriguez
fury
died
down
only
because
it
is
difficult
to
feel
two
emotions
at
once
it
died
down
as
pity
took
its
place
though
every
now
and
then
it
would
suddenly
flare
and
fall
again
he
returned
his
sword
and
lifted
the
young
hidalgo
and
carried
him
to
the
door
of
the
house
under
which
they
had
fought
with
one
fist
he
beat
on
the
door
without
putting
the
hurt
man
down
and
continued
to
hit
it
until
steps
were
heard
and
bolts
began
to
grumble
as
though
disturbed
too
early
from
their
rusty
sleep
in
stone
sockets
the
door
of
the
house
with
the
balcony
was
opened
by
a
servant
who
when
he
saw
who
it
was
that
rodriguez
carried
fled
into
the
house
in
alarm
as
one
who
runs
with
bad
news
he
carried
one
candle
and
when
he
had
disappeared
with
the
steaming
flame
rodriguez
found
himself
in
a
long
hall
lit
by
the
moonlight
only
which
was
looking
in
through
the
small
contorted
panes
of
the
upper
part
of
a
high
window
alone
with
echoes
and
shadows
rodriguez
carried
the
hurt
man
through
the
hall
who
was
muttering
now
as
he
came
back
to
consciousness
and
as
he
went
there
came
to
rodriguez
thoughts
between
wonder
and
hope
for
he
had
had
no
thought
at
all
when
he
beat
on
the
door
except
to
get
shelter
and
help
for
the
hurt
man
at
the
end
of
the
hall
they
came
to
an
open
door
that
led
into
a
chamber
partly
shining
with
moonlight
in
there
said
the
man
that
he
carried
rodriguez
carried
him
in
and
laid
him
on
a
long
couch
at
the
end
of
the
room
large
pictures
of
men
in
the
blackness
out
of
the
moon
rays
frowned
at
rodriguez
mysteriously
he
could
not
see
their
faces
in
the
darkness
but
he
somehow
knew
they
frowned
two
portraits
that
were
clear
in
the
moonlight
eyed
him
with
absolute
apathy
so
cold
a
welcome
from
that
house
past
generations
boded
no
good
to
him
from
those
that
dwelt
there
today
rodriguez
knew
that
in
carrying
the
hurt
man
there
he
helped
at
a
christian
deed
and
yet
there
was
no
putting
the
merits
of
the
case
against
the
omens
that
crowded
the
chamber
lurking
along
the
edge
of
moonlight
and
darkness
disappearing
and
reappearing
till
the
gloom
was
heavy
with
portent
the
omens
knew
in
a
weak
voice
and
few
words
the
hurt
man
thanked
him
but
the
apathetic
faces
seemed
to
say
what
of
that
and
the
frowning
faces
that
he
could
not
see
still
filled
the
darkness
with
anger
and
then
from
the
end
of
the
chamber
dressed
in
white
and
all
shining
with
moonlight
came
serafina
rodriguez
in
awed
silence
watched
her
come
he
saw
her
pass
through
the
moonlight
and
grow
dimmer
and
glide
to
the
moonlight
again
that
streamed
through
another
window
a
great
dim
golden
circle
appeared
at
the
far
end
of
the
chamber
whence
she
had
come
as
the
servant
returned
with
his
candle
and
held
it
high
to
give
light
for
dona
serafina
but
that
one
flame
seemed
to
make
the
darkness
only
blacker
and
for
any
cheerfulness
it
brought
to
the
gloom
it
had
better
never
have
challenged
those
masses
of
darkness
at
all
in
that
high
chamber
among
the
brooding
portraits
it
seemed
trivial
ephemeral
modern
ill
able
to
cope
with
the
power
of
ancient
things
dead
days
and
forgotten
voices
which
make
their
home
in
the
darkness
because
the
days
that
have
usurped
them
have
stolen
the
light
of
the
sun
and
there
the
man
stood
holding
his
candle
high
and
the
rays
of
the
moon
became
more
magical
still
beside
that
little
mundane
flickering
thing
and
serafina
was
moving
through
the
moonlight
as
though
its
rays
were
her
sisters
which
she
met
noiselessly
and
brightly
upon
some
island
as
it
seemed
to
rodriguez
beyond
the
coasts
of
earth
so
quietly
and
so
brightly
did
her
slender
figure
move
and
so
aloof
from
him
appeared
her
eyes
and
there
came
on
rodriguez
that
feeling
that
some
deride
and
that
others
explain
away
the
feeling
of
which
romance
is
mainly
made
and
which
is
the
aim
and
goal
of
all
the
earth
and
his
love
for
serafina
seemed
to
him
not
only
to
be
an
event
in
his
life
but
to
have
some
part
in
veiled
and
shadowy
destinies
and
to
have
the
blessing
of
most
distant
days
grey
beards
seemed
to
look
out
of
graves
in
forgotten
places
to
wag
approval
hands
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
out
of
times
where
faces
were
smiling
quietly
and
dreaming
on
further
still
this
vast
approval
that
gave
benediction
to
his
youthful
fancy
seemed
to
widen
and
widen
like
the
gold
of
a
evening
or
the
humming
of
bees
in
summer
in
endless
rows
of
limes
until
it
became
a
part
of
the
story
of
man
spring
days
of
his
earliest
memory
seemed
to
have
their
part
in
it
as
well
as
wonderful
evenings
of
days
that
were
yet
to
be
till
his
love
for
serafina
was
one
with
the
fate
of
earth
and
wandering
far
on
their
courses
he
knew
that
the
stars
blessed
it
but
serafina
went
up
to
the
man
on
the
couch
with
no
look
for
rodriguez
with
no
look
for
rodriguez
she
bent
over
the
stricken
hidalgo
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
one
elbow
it
is
nothing
he
said
serafina
still
she
bent
over
him
he
laid
his
head
down
again
but
now
with
open
and
undimmed
eyes
she
put
her
hand
to
his
forehead
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
him
she
lavished
upon
him
sympathy
for
which
rodriguez
would
have
offered
his
head
to
swords
and
all
thought
rodriguez
for
three
blows
from
a
knave
and
his
anger
against
morano
flared
up
again
fiercely
then
there
came
another
thought
to
him
out
of
the
shadows
where
serafina
was
standing
all
white
a
figure
of
solace
who
was
this
man
who
so
mysteriously
blended
with
the
other
unknown
things
that
haunted
the
gloom
of
that
chamber
why
had
he
fought
him
at
night
what
was
he
to
serafina
thoughts
crowded
up
to
him
from
the
interior
of
the
darkness
sombre
and
foreboding
as
the
shadows
that
nursed
them
he
stood
there
never
daring
to
speak
to
serafina
looking
for
permission
to
speak
such
as
a
glance
might
give
and
no
glance
came
and
now
as
though
soothed
by
her
beauty
the
hurt
man
closed
his
eyes
serafina
stood
beside
him
anxious
and
silent
gleaming
in
that
dim
place
the
servant
at
the
far
end
of
the
chamber
still
held
his
one
candle
high
as
though
some
light
of
earth
were
needed
against
the
fantastic
moon
which
if
unopposed
would
give
everything
over
to
magic
rodriguez
stood
there
scarcely
breathing
all
was
silent
and
then
through
the
door
by
which
serafina
had
come
past
that
lonely
golden
candle
all
down
the
long
room
across
moonlight
and
blackness
came
the
lady
of
the
house
serafina
mother
she
came
as
serafina
came
straight
toward
the
man
on
the
couch
giving
no
look
to
rodriguez
walking
something
as
serafina
walked
with
the
same
poise
the
same
dignity
though
the
years
had
carried
away
from
her
the
grace
serafina
had
so
that
though
you
saw
that
they
were
mother
and
daughter
the
elder
lady
called
to
mind
the
lovely
things
of
earth
large
gardens
at
evening
statues
dim
in
the
dusk
summer
and
whatsoever
binds
us
to
earthly
things
but
serafina
turned
thoughts
to
the
twilight
in
which
he
first
saw
her
and
he
pictured
her
native
place
as
far
from
here
in
mellow
fields
near
the
moon
wherein
she
had
walked
on
twilight
outlasting
any
we
know
with
all
delicate
things
of
our
fancy
too
fair
for
the
rugged
earth
as
the
lady
approached
the
couch
upon
which
the
young
man
was
lying
and
still
no
look
was
turned
towards
rodriguez
his
young
dreams
fled
as
butterflies
sailing
high
in
the
heat
of
june
that
are
suddenly
plunged
in
night
by
a
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
he
had
never
spoken
to
serafina
or
seen
before
her
mother
and
they
did
not
know
his
name
he
knew
that
he
rodriguez
had
no
claim
to
a
welcome
but
his
dreams
had
flocked
so
much
about
serafina
face
basking
so
much
in
her
beauty
that
they
now
fell
back
dying
and
when
a
man
dreams
die
what
remains
if
he
lingers
awhile
behind
them
rodriguez
suddenly
felt
that
his
left
shoe
was
off
and
his
right
eye
still
bandaged
things
that
he
had
not
noticed
while
his
only
thought
was
for
the
man
he
carried
to
shelter
but
torturing
his
consciousness
now
that
he
thought
of
himself
he
opened
his
lips
to
explain
but
before
words
came
to
him
looking
at
the
face
of
serafina
mother
standing
now
by
the
couch
he
felt
that
not
knowing
how
he
had
somehow
wronged
the
penates
of
this
house
or
whatever
was
hid
in
the
dimness
of
that
long
chamber
by
carrying
in
this
young
man
there
to
rest
from
his
hurt
rodriguez
depression
arose
from
these
causes
but
having
arisen
it
grew
of
its
own
might
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
morning
and
in
the
favouring
atmosphere
of
hunger
his
depression
grew
gigantic
he
opened
his
lips
once
more
to
say
farewell
was
oppressed
by
all
manner
of
thoughts
that
held
him
dumb
and
turned
away
in
silence
and
left
the
house
outside
he
recovered
his
mandolin
and
his
shoe
he
was
tired
with
the
weariness
of
defeated
dreams
that
slept
in
his
spirit
exhausted
rather
than
with
any
fatigue
his
young
muscles
had
from
the
journey
he
needed
sleep
he
looked
at
the
shuttered
houses
then
at
the
soft
dust
of
the
road
in
which
dogs
lay
during
the
daylight
but
the
dust
was
near
to
his
mood
so
he
lay
down
where
he
had
fought
the
unknown
hidalgo
a
light
wind
wandered
the
street
like
a
visitor
come
to
the
village
out
of
a
friendly
valley
but
rodriguez
four
days
on
the
roads
had
made
him
familiar
with
all
wandering
things
and
the
breeze
on
his
forehead
troubled
him
not
at
all
before
it
had
wearied
of
wandering
in
the
night
rodriguez
had
fallen
asleep
just
by
the
edge
of
sleep
upon
which
side
he
knew
not
he
heard
the
window
of
the
balcony
creak
and
looked
up
wide
awake
all
in
a
moment
but
nothing
stirred
in
the
darkness
of
the
balcony
and
the
window
was
fast
shut
so
whatever
sound
came
from
the
window
came
not
from
its
opening
but
shutting
for
a
while
he
wondered
and
then
his
tired
thoughts
rested
and
that
was
sleep
a
light
rain
woke
rodriguez
drizzling
upon
his
face
the
first
light
rain
that
had
fallen
in
a
romantic
tale
storms
there
had
been
lashing
oaks
to
terrific
shapes
seen
at
night
by
flashes
of
lightning
through
which
villains
rode
abroad
or
heroes
sought
shelter
at
midnight
hurricanes
there
had
been
flapping
huge
cloaks
fierce
hail
and
copious
snow
but
until
now
no
drizzle
it
was
morning
dawn
was
old
and
pale
and
grey
and
unhappy
the
balcony
above
him
still
empty
scarcely
even
held
romance
now
rain
dripped
from
it
sadly
its
cheerless
bareness
seemed
worse
than
the
most
sinister
shadows
of
night
and
then
rodriguez
saw
a
rose
lying
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
for
all
the
dreams
fancies
and
hopes
that
leaped
up
in
rodriguez
mind
rising
and
falling
and
fading
one
thing
alone
he
knew
and
all
the
rest
was
mystery
the
rose
had
lain
there
before
the
rain
had
fallen
beneath
the
rose
was
white
dust
while
all
around
it
the
dust
was
turning
grey
with
rain
rodriguez
tried
to
guess
how
long
the
rain
had
fallen
the
rose
may
have
lain
beside
him
all
night
long
but
the
shadows
of
mystery
receded
no
farther
than
this
one
fact
that
the
rose
was
there
before
the
rain
began
no
sign
of
any
kind
came
from
the
house
rodriguez
put
the
rose
safe
under
his
coat
wrapped
in
the
kerchief
that
had
guarded
the
mandolin
to
carry
it
far
from
lowlight
through
places
familiar
with
roses
and
places
strange
to
them
but
it
remained
for
him
a
thing
of
mystery
until
a
day
far
from
then
sadly
he
left
the
house
in
the
sad
rain
marching
away
alone
to
look
for
his
wars
the
seventh
chronicle
how
he
came
to
shadow
valley
rodriguez
still
believed
it
to
be
the
duty
of
any
christian
man
to
kill
morano
yet
more
than
comfort
more
than
dryness
he
missed
cheerful
chatter
and
his
philosophy
into
which
all
occasions
so
easily
slipped
upon
his
first
day
journey
all
was
new
the
very
anemones
kept
him
company
but
now
he
made
the
discovery
that
lonely
roads
are
long
when
he
had
suggested
food
or
rest
morano
had
fallen
in
with
his
wishes
when
he
had
suggested
winning
a
castle
in
vague
wars
morano
had
agreed
with
him
now
he
had
dismissed
morano
and
had
driven
him
away
at
the
rapier
point
there
was
no
one
now
either
to
cook
his
food
or
to
believe
in
the
schemes
his
ambition
made
there
was
no
one
now
to
speak
of
the
wars
as
the
natural
end
of
the
journey
alone
in
the
rain
the
wars
seemed
far
away
and
castles
hard
to
come
by
the
unromantic
rain
in
which
no
dreams
thrive
fell
on
and
on
the
village
of
lowlight
was
some
way
behind
him
as
he
went
with
mournful
thoughts
through
the
drizzling
rain
when
he
caught
the
smell
of
bacon
he
looked
for
a
house
but
the
plain
was
bare
except
for
small
bushes
he
looked
up
wind
which
was
blowing
from
the
west
whence
came
the
unmistakable
smell
of
bacon
and
there
was
a
small
fire
smoking
greyly
against
a
bush
and
the
fat
figure
crouching
beside
it
although
the
face
was
averted
was
clearly
none
but
morano
and
when
rodriguez
saw
that
he
was
tenderly
holding
the
infamous
the
very
weapon
that
had
done
the
accursed
deed
then
he
almost
felt
righteous
anger
but
that
held
other
memories
too
and
rodriguez
felt
less
fury
than
what
he
thought
he
felt
as
for
killing
morano
rodriguez
believed
or
thought
he
believed
that
he
was
too
far
from
the
road
for
it
to
be
possible
to
overtake
him
to
mete
out
his
just
punishment
as
for
the
bacon
rodriguez
scorned
it
and
marched
on
down
the
road
now
one
side
of
the
was
very
hot
for
it
was
tilted
a
little
and
the
lard
had
run
sideways
by
tilting
it
back
again
slowly
morano
could
make
the
fat
run
back
bit
by
bit
over
the
heated
metal
and
whenever
it
did
so
it
sizzled
he
now
picked
up
the
and
one
log
that
was
burning
well
and
walked
parallel
with
rodriguez
he
was
of
him
and
whenever
the
sizzled
rodriguez
caught
the
smell
of
it
a
small
matter
to
inspire
thoughts
but
rodriguez
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
before
and
ideas
surged
through
his
head
and
though
they
began
with
moral
indignation
they
adapted
themselves
more
and
more
to
hunger
until
there
came
the
idea
that
since
his
money
had
bought
the
bacon
the
food
was
rightfully
his
and
he
had
every
right
to
eat
it
wherever
he
found
it
so
much
can
slaves
sometimes
control
the
master
and
the
body
rule
the
brain
so
rodriguez
suddenly
turned
and
strode
up
to
morano
my
bacon
he
said
master
morano
said
for
it
was
beginning
to
cool
let
me
make
another
small
fire
knave
call
me
not
master
said
rodriguez
morano
who
knew
when
speech
was
good
was
silent
now
and
blew
on
the
smouldering
end
of
the
log
he
carried
and
gathered
a
handful
of
twigs
and
shook
the
rain
off
them
and
soon
had
a
small
fire
again
warming
the
bacon
he
had
nothing
to
say
which
bacon
could
not
say
better
and
when
rodriguez
had
finished
up
the
bacon
he
carefully
reconsidered
the
case
of
morano
and
there
were
points
in
it
which
he
had
not
thought
of
before
he
reflected
that
for
the
execution
of
knaves
a
suitable
person
was
provided
he
should
perhaps
give
morano
up
to
la
garda
his
next
thought
was
where
to
find
la
garda
and
easily
enough
another
thought
followed
that
one
which
was
that
although
on
foot
and
still
some
way
behind
four
of
la
garda
were
trying
to
find
him
rodriguez
mind
which
was
looking
at
life
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
judge
changed
somewhat
at
this
thought
he
reflected
next
that
for
the
prevention
of
crime
to
make
morano
see
the
true
nature
of
his
enormity
so
that
he
should
never
commit
it
again
might
after
all
be
as
good
as
killing
him
so
what
we
call
his
better
nature
his
calmer
judgment
decided
him
now
to
talk
to
morano
and
not
to
kill
him
but
morano
looking
back
upon
this
merciful
change
always
attributed
it
to
fried
bacon
morano
said
rodriguez
better
nature
to
offend
the
laws
of
chivalry
is
to
have
against
you
the
swords
of
all
true
men
master
morano
said
that
were
dreadful
odds
and
rightly
said
rodriguez
master
said
morano
i
will
keep
those
laws
henceforth
i
may
cook
bacon
for
you
when
you
are
hungry
i
may
brush
the
dust
from
your
cloak
i
may
see
to
your
comforts
this
chivalry
forbids
none
of
that
but
when
i
see
anyone
trying
to
kill
you
master
why
kill
you
he
must
and
welcome
not
always
said
rodriguez
somewhat
curtly
for
it
struck
him
that
morano
spoke
somehow
too
lightly
of
sacred
things
not
always
asked
morano
no
said
rodriguez
master
i
implore
you
tell
me
said
morano
when
they
may
kill
you
and
when
they
may
not
so
that
i
may
never
offend
again
rodriguez
cast
a
swift
glance
at
him
but
found
his
face
so
full
of
puzzled
anxiety
that
he
condescended
to
do
what
morano
had
asked
and
began
to
explain
to
him
the
rudiments
of
the
laws
of
chivalry
in
the
wars
he
said
you
may
defend
me
whoever
assails
me
or
if
robbers
or
any
common
persons
attack
me
but
if
i
arrange
a
meeting
with
a
gentleman
and
any
knave
basely
interferes
then
is
he
damned
hereafter
as
well
as
accursed
now
for
the
laws
of
chivalry
being
founded
on
true
religion
the
penalty
for
their
breach
is
by
no
means
confined
to
this
world
master
replied
morano
thoughtfully
if
i
be
not
damned
already
i
will
avoid
those
fires
of
hell
and
none
shall
kill
you
that
you
have
not
chosen
to
kill
you
and
those
that
you
choose
shall
kill
you
whenever
you
have
a
mind
rodriguez
opened
his
lips
to
correct
morano
but
reflected
that
though
in
his
crude
and
way
he
had
correctly
interpreted
the
law
so
far
as
his
mind
was
able
so
he
briefly
said
yes
and
rose
and
returned
to
the
road
giving
morano
no
order
to
follow
him
and
this
was
the
last
concession
he
made
to
the
needs
of
chivalry
on
account
of
the
sin
of
morano
morano
gathered
up
the
and
followed
rodriguez
and
when
they
came
to
the
road
he
walked
behind
him
in
silence
for
three
or
four
miles
they
walked
thus
morano
knowing
that
he
followed
on
sufferance
and
calling
no
attention
to
himself
with
his
garrulous
tongue
but
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
rain
lifted
and
with
the
coming
out
of
the
sun
morano
talked
again
master
he
said
the
next
man
that
you
choose
to
kill
you
let
him
be
one
too
to
know
the
tricks
of
the
rapier
too
ignorant
to
do
aught
but
wish
you
well
some
poor
fat
fool
over
forty
who
shall
be
too
heavy
to
elude
your
rapier
point
and
too
elderly
for
it
to
matter
when
you
kill
him
at
your
chivalry
the
best
of
life
being
gone
already
at
there
is
timber
here
said
rodriguez
we
will
have
some
more
bacon
while
you
dry
my
cloak
over
a
fire
thus
he
acknowledged
morano
again
for
his
servant
but
never
acknowledged
that
in
morano
words
he
had
understood
any
poor
sketch
of
morano
self
or
that
the
words
went
to
his
heart
timber
master
said
morano
though
it
did
not
need
rodriguez
to
point
out
the
great
oaks
that
now
began
to
stand
beside
their
journey
but
he
saw
that
the
other
matter
was
well
and
thus
he
left
well
alone
rodriguez
waved
an
arm
towards
the
great
trees
yes
indeed
said
morano
and
began
to
polish
up
the
as
he
walked
rodriguez
who
missed
little
caught
a
glimpse
of
tears
in
eyes
for
all
that
his
head
was
turned
downward
over
the
yet
he
said
nothing
for
he
knew
that
forgiveness
was
all
that
morano
needed
and
that
he
had
now
given
him
and
it
was
much
to
give
reflected
rodriguez
for
so
great
a
crime
and
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
now
their
road
dipped
downhill
and
they
passed
a
huge
oak
and
then
another
more
and
more
often
now
they
met
these
solitary
giants
till
their
view
began
to
be
obscured
by
them
the
road
dwindled
till
it
was
no
better
than
a
track
the
earth
beside
it
was
wild
and
rocky
rodriguez
wondered
to
what
manner
of
land
he
was
coming
but
continually
the
branches
of
some
tree
obscured
his
view
and
the
only
indication
he
had
of
it
was
from
the
road
he
trod
which
seemed
to
tell
him
that
men
came
here
seldom
beyond
every
huge
tree
that
they
passed
as
they
went
downhill
rodriguez
hoped
to
get
a
better
view
but
always
there
stood
another
to
close
the
vista
it
was
some
while
before
he
realised
that
he
had
entered
a
forest
they
were
come
to
shadow
valley
the
grandeur
of
this
place
penetrated
by
shafts
of
sunlight
coloured
by
flashes
of
floating
butterflies
filled
by
the
chaunt
of
birds
rising
over
the
long
hum
of
insects
lifted
the
fallen
spirits
of
rodriguez
as
he
walked
on
through
the
morning
he
still
would
not
have
exchanged
his
rose
for
the
whole
forest
but
in
the
mighty
solemnity
of
the
forest
his
mourning
for
the
lady
that
he
feared
he
had
lost
no
longer
seemed
the
only
solemn
thing
indeed
the
sombre
forest
seemed
well
attuned
to
his
mood
and
what
complaint
have
we
against
fate
wherever
this
is
so
his
mood
was
one
of
tragic
loss
the
defeat
of
an
enterprise
that
his
hopes
had
undertaken
to
seize
victory
on
the
apex
of
the
world
to
walk
all
his
days
only
just
outside
the
edge
of
paradise
for
no
less
than
that
his
hopes
and
his
first
love
promised
each
other
and
then
he
walked
despairing
in
small
rain
in
this
mood
fate
had
led
him
to
solemn
old
oaks
standing
huge
among
shadows
and
the
grandeur
of
their
grey
grip
on
the
earth
that
had
been
theirs
for
centuries
was
akin
to
the
grandeur
of
the
high
hopes
he
had
had
and
his
despair
was
somehow
soothed
by
the
shadows
and
then
the
impudent
birds
seemed
to
say
hope
again
they
walked
for
miles
into
the
forest
and
lit
a
fire
before
noon
for
rodriguez
had
left
lowlight
very
early
and
by
it
morano
cooked
bacon
again
and
dried
his
master
cloak
they
ate
the
bacon
and
sat
by
the
fire
till
all
their
clothes
were
dry
and
when
the
flames
from
the
great
logs
fell
and
only
embers
glowed
they
sat
there
still
with
hands
spread
to
the
warmth
of
the
embers
for
to
those
who
wander
a
fire
is
food
and
rest
and
comfort
only
as
the
embers
turned
grey
did
they
throw
earth
over
their
fire
and
continue
their
journey
their
road
grew
smaller
and
the
forest
denser
they
had
walked
some
miles
from
the
place
where
they
lit
their
fire
when
a
somewhat
unmistakable
sound
made
rodriguez
look
ahead
of
him
an
arrow
had
struck
a
birch
tree
on
the
right
side
ten
or
twelve
paces
in
front
of
him
and
as
he
looked
up
another
struck
it
from
the
opposite
side
just
level
with
the
first
the
two
were
sticking
in
it
ten
feet
or
so
from
the
ground
rodriguez
drew
his
sword
but
when
a
third
arrow
went
over
his
head
from
behind
and
struck
the
birch
tree
whut
just
between
the
other
two
he
perceived
as
duller
minds
could
have
done
that
it
was
a
hint
and
he
returned
his
sword
and
stood
still
morano
questioned
his
master
with
his
eyes
which
were
asking
what
was
to
be
done
next
but
rodriguez
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
was
no
fighting
with
an
invisible
foe
that
could
shoot
like
that
that
much
morano
knew
but
he
did
not
know
that
there
might
not
be
some
law
of
chivalry
that
would
demand
that
rodriguez
should
wave
his
sword
in
the
air
or
thrust
at
the
birch
tree
until
someone
shot
him
when
there
seemed
to
be
no
such
rule
morano
was
well
content
and
presently
men
came
quietly
on
to
the
road
from
different
parts
of
the
wood
they
were
dressed
in
brown
leather
and
wore
hats
and
round
each
one
neck
hung
a
disk
of
engraved
copper
they
came
up
to
the
travellers
carrying
bows
and
the
leader
said
to
rodriguez
señor
all
travellers
here
bring
tribute
to
the
king
of
shadow
valley
at
the
mention
of
whom
all
touched
hats
and
bowed
their
heads
what
do
you
bring
us
rodriguez
thought
of
no
answer
but
after
a
moment
he
said
for
the
sake
of
loyalty
i
know
one
king
only
there
is
only
one
king
in
shadow
valley
said
the
bowman
he
brings
a
tribute
of
emeralds
said
another
looking
at
scabbard
and
then
they
searched
him
and
others
search
morano
there
were
eight
or
nine
of
them
all
in
their
hats
with
ribbons
round
their
necks
of
the
same
colour
to
hold
the
copper
disks
they
took
a
gold
coin
from
morano
and
grey
greasy
pieces
of
silver
one
of
them
took
his
but
he
looked
so
pitifully
at
them
as
he
said
simply
i
starve
that
the
was
restored
to
him
they
unbuckled
rodriguez
belt
and
took
from
him
sword
and
scabbard
and
three
gold
pieces
from
his
purse
next
they
found
the
gold
piece
that
was
hanging
round
his
neck
still
stuffed
inside
his
clothes
where
he
had
put
it
when
he
was
riding
having
examined
it
they
put
it
back
inside
his
clothes
while
the
leader
rebuckled
his
about
his
waist
and
returned
him
his
three
others
returned
his
money
to
morano
master
said
the
leader
bowing
to
rodriguez
his
green
hat
in
hand
under
our
king
the
forest
is
yours
morano
was
pleased
to
hear
this
respect
paid
to
his
master
but
rodriguez
was
so
surprised
that
he
who
was
never
curt
without
reason
found
no
more
to
say
than
why
because
we
are
your
servants
said
the
other
who
are
you
asked
rodriguez
we
are
the
green
bowmen
master
he
said
who
hold
this
forest
against
all
men
for
our
king
and
who
is
he
said
rodriguez
and
the
bowman
answered
the
king
of
shadow
valley
at
which
the
others
all
touched
hats
and
bowed
heads
again
and
rodriguez
seeing
that
the
mystery
would
grow
no
clearer
for
any
information
to
be
had
from
them
said
conduct
me
to
your
king
that
master
we
can
not
do
said
the
chief
of
the
bowmen
there
be
many
trees
in
this
forest
and
behind
any
one
of
them
he
holds
his
court
when
he
needs
us
there
is
his
clear
horn
but
when
men
need
him
who
knows
which
shadow
is
his
of
all
that
lie
in
the
forest
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
interesting
in
the
mystery
to
rodriguez
it
was
merely
annoying
and
finding
it
grew
no
clearer
he
turned
his
attention
to
shelter
for
the
night
to
which
all
travellers
give
a
thought
at
least
once
between
noon
and
sunset
is
there
any
house
on
this
road
señor
he
said
in
which
we
could
rest
the
night
ten
miles
from
here
said
he
and
not
far
from
the
road
you
take
is
the
best
house
we
have
in
the
forest
it
is
yours
master
for
as
long
as
you
honour
it
come
then
said
rodriguez
and
i
thank
you
señor
so
they
all
started
together
rodriguez
with
the
leader
going
in
front
and
morano
following
with
all
the
bowmen
and
soon
the
bowmen
were
singing
songs
of
the
forest
hunting
songs
songs
of
the
winter
and
songs
of
the
long
summer
evenings
songs
of
love
cheered
by
this
merriment
the
miles
slipped
by
and
rodriguez
gathered
from
the
songs
they
sang
something
of
what
they
were
and
of
how
they
lived
in
the
forest
living
amongst
the
woodland
creatures
till
these
men
ways
were
almost
as
their
ways
killing
what
they
needed
for
food
but
protecting
the
woodland
things
against
all
others
straying
out
amongst
the
villages
in
summer
evenings
and
always
welcome
and
owning
no
allegiance
but
to
the
king
of
the
shadow
valley
and
the
leader
told
rodriguez
that
his
name
was
miguel
threegeese
given
him
on
account
of
an
exploit
in
his
youth
when
he
lay
one
night
with
his
bow
by
one
of
the
great
pools
in
the
forest
where
the
geese
come
in
winter
he
said
the
forest
was
a
hundred
miles
long
lying
mostly
along
a
great
valley
which
they
were
crossing
and
once
they
had
owned
allegiance
to
kings
of
spain
but
now
to
none
but
the
king
of
the
shadow
valley
for
the
king
of
spain
men
had
once
tried
to
cut
some
of
the
forest
down
and
the
forest
was
sacred
behind
him
the
men
sang
on
of
woodland
things
and
of
cottage
gardens
in
the
villages
with
singing
and
laughter
they
came
to
their
end
a
cottage
as
though
built
by
peasants
with
boundless
material
stood
in
the
forest
it
was
a
thatched
cottage
built
in
the
way
but
of
enormous
size
the
leader
entered
first
and
whispered
to
those
within
who
rose
and
bowed
to
rodriguez
as
he
entered
twenty
more
bowmen
who
had
been
sitting
at
a
table
one
does
not
speak
of
the
of
a
cottage
but
such
it
appeared
for
it
occupied
more
than
half
of
the
cottage
and
was
as
large
as
the
of
any
castle
it
was
made
of
great
beams
of
oak
and
high
at
either
end
just
under
the
thatch
were
windows
with
their
little
square
panes
of
bulging
bluish
glass
which
at
that
time
was
rare
in
spain
a
table
of
oak
ran
down
the
length
of
it
cut
from
a
single
tree
polished
and
dark
from
the
hands
of
many
men
that
had
sat
at
it
boar
spears
hung
on
the
wall
great
antlers
and
boar
tusks
and
carved
in
the
oak
of
the
wall
and
again
on
a
high
dark
chair
that
stood
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
empty
a
crown
with
oak
leaves
that
rodriguez
recognised
it
was
the
same
as
the
one
that
was
cut
on
his
gold
coin
which
he
had
given
no
further
thought
to
riding
to
lowlight
and
which
the
face
of
serafina
had
driven
from
his
mind
altogether
but
he
said
and
then
was
silent
thinking
to
learn
more
by
watching
than
by
talking
and
his
companions
of
the
road
came
in
and
all
sat
down
on
the
benches
beside
the
ample
table
and
a
brew
was
brought
a
kind
of
pale
mead
that
they
called
forest
water
and
all
drank
and
sitting
at
the
table
watching
them
more
closely
than
he
could
as
he
walked
in
the
forest
rodriguez
saw
by
the
sunlight
that
streamed
in
low
through
one
window
that
on
the
copper
disks
they
wore
round
their
necks
on
green
ribbon
the
design
was
again
the
same
it
was
much
smaller
than
his
on
the
gold
coin
but
the
same
strange
leafy
crown
wear
it
as
you
go
through
shadow
valley
he
now
seemed
to
remember
the
man
saying
to
him
who
put
it
round
his
neck
but
why
clearly
because
it
was
the
badge
of
this
band
of
men
and
this
other
man
was
one
of
them
his
eyes
strayed
back
to
the
great
design
on
the
wall
the
crown
of
the
forest
said
miguel
as
he
saw
his
eyes
wondering
at
it
as
you
doubtless
know
señor
why
should
he
know
of
course
because
he
bore
the
design
himself
who
wears
it
said
rodriguez
the
king
of
shadow
valley
morano
was
without
curiosity
he
did
not
question
good
drink
he
sat
at
the
table
with
a
cup
of
horn
in
his
hand
as
happy
as
though
he
had
come
to
his
master
castle
though
that
had
not
yet
been
won
the
sun
sank
under
the
oaks
filling
the
hall
with
a
ruddy
glow
turning
the
boar
spears
scarlet
and
reddening
the
red
faces
of
the
merry
men
of
the
bow
a
dozen
of
the
men
went
out
to
relieve
the
guard
in
the
forest
miguel
explained
and
rodriguez
learned
that
he
had
come
through
a
line
of
sentries
without
ever
seeing
one
presently
a
dozen
others
came
in
from
their
posts
and
unslung
their
bows
and
laid
them
on
pegs
on
the
wall
and
sat
down
at
the
table
whereat
there
were
whispered
words
and
they
all
rose
and
bowed
to
rodriguez
and
rodriguez
had
caught
the
words
a
prince
of
the
forest
what
did
it
mean
soon
the
long
hall
grew
dim
and
his
love
for
the
light
drew
rodriguez
out
to
watch
the
sunset
and
there
was
the
sun
under
indescribable
clouds
turning
huge
and
yellow
among
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
casting
glory
munificently
down
glades
it
set
and
the
western
sky
became
and
lilac
from
the
other
end
of
the
sky
the
moon
peeped
out
of
night
a
hush
came
and
a
chill
and
a
glory
of
colour
and
a
dying
away
of
light
and
in
the
hush
the
mystery
of
the
great
oaks
became
magical
a
blackbird
blew
a
tune
less
of
this
earth
than
of
rodriguez
wished
that
he
could
have
had
a
less
ambition
than
to
win
a
castle
in
the
wars
for
in
those
glades
and
among
those
oaks
he
felt
that
happiness
might
be
found
under
roofs
of
thatch
but
having
come
by
his
ambition
he
would
not
desert
it
now
rushlights
were
lit
in
the
great
cottage
and
the
window
of
the
long
room
glowed
yellow
a
fountain
fell
in
the
stillness
that
he
had
not
heard
before
an
early
nightingale
tuned
a
tentative
note
the
forest
is
fair
is
it
not
said
miguel
rodriguez
had
no
words
to
say
to
turn
into
words
the
beauty
that
was
now
shining
in
his
thoughts
reflected
from
the
evening
there
was
no
easier
than
for
wood
to
reflect
all
that
is
seen
in
the
mirror
you
love
the
forest
he
said
at
last
master
said
miguel
it
is
the
only
land
in
which
we
should
live
our
days
there
are
cities
and
roads
but
man
is
not
meant
for
them
i
know
not
master
what
god
intends
about
us
but
in
cities
we
are
against
the
intention
at
every
step
while
here
why
we
drift
along
with
it
i
too
would
live
here
always
said
rodriguez
the
house
is
yours
said
miguel
and
rodriguez
answered
i
go
tomorrow
to
the
wars
they
turned
round
then
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
cottage
and
entered
the
candlelight
and
the
loud
talk
of
many
men
out
of
the
hush
of
the
twilight
but
they
passed
from
the
room
at
once
by
a
door
on
the
left
and
came
thus
to
a
large
bedroom
the
only
other
room
in
the
cottage
your
room
master
said
miguel
threegeese
it
was
not
so
big
as
the
hall
where
the
bowmen
sat
but
it
was
a
goodly
room
the
bed
was
made
of
carved
wood
for
there
were
craftsmen
in
the
forest
and
a
hunt
went
all
the
way
round
it
with
dogs
and
deer
four
great
posts
held
a
canopy
over
it
they
were
four
young
seemingly
still
wearing
their
bright
bark
but
this
had
been
painted
on
their
bare
timber
by
some
woodland
artist
the
chairs
had
not
the
beauty
of
the
great
ages
of
furniture
but
they
had
a
dignity
that
the
age
of
commerce
has
not
dreamed
of
each
one
was
carved
out
of
a
single
block
of
wood
there
was
no
join
in
them
anywhere
one
of
them
lasts
to
this
day
the
skins
of
deer
covered
the
long
walls
there
were
great
basins
and
jugs
of
earthenware
all
was
the
very
shadows
whispering
among
themselves
in
corners
spoke
of
the
forest
the
room
was
rude
but
being
without
ornament
except
for
the
work
of
simple
craftsmen
it
had
nothing
there
to
offend
the
sense
of
right
of
anyone
entering
its
door
by
any
jarring
conflict
with
the
purposes
and
traditions
of
the
land
in
which
it
stood
all
the
woodland
spirits
might
have
entered
there
and
slept
if
spirits
sleep
in
the
great
bed
and
left
at
dawn
unoffended
in
fact
that
age
had
not
yet
learned
vulgarity
when
miguel
threegeese
left
morano
entered
master
he
said
they
are
making
a
banquet
for
you
good
said
rodriguez
we
will
eat
it
and
he
waited
to
hear
what
morano
had
come
to
say
for
he
could
see
that
it
was
more
than
this
master
said
morano
i
have
been
talking
with
the
bowman
and
they
will
give
you
whatever
you
ask
they
are
good
people
master
and
they
will
give
you
all
things
whatever
you
asked
of
them
rodriguez
would
not
show
to
his
servant
that
it
all
still
puzzled
him
they
are
very
amiable
men
he
said
master
said
morano
coming
to
the
point
that
garda
they
will
have
walked
after
us
they
must
be
now
in
lowlight
they
have
all
to
get
new
shoes
on
their
horses
and
master
if
we
be
still
on
foot
rodriguez
was
thinking
morano
seemed
to
him
to
be
talking
sense
you
would
like
another
ride
he
said
to
morano
master
he
answered
riding
is
horrible
but
the
public
garrotter
he
is
a
bad
thing
too
and
he
meditatively
stroked
the
bristles
under
his
chin
they
would
give
us
horses
said
rodriguez
anything
master
i
am
sure
of
it
they
are
good
people
they
have
news
of
the
road
by
which
they
left
lowlight
said
rodriguez
reflectively
they
say
la
garda
dare
not
enter
the
forest
morano
continued
but
thirty
miles
from
here
the
forest
ends
they
could
ride
round
while
we
go
through
they
would
give
us
horses
said
rodriguez
again
surely
said
morano
and
then
rodriguez
asked
where
they
cooked
the
banquet
since
he
saw
that
there
were
only
two
rooms
in
the
great
cottage
and
his
inquiring
eye
saw
no
preparations
for
cooking
about
the
fireplace
of
either
and
morano
pointed
through
a
window
at
the
back
of
the
room
to
another
cottage
among
the
trees
fifty
paces
away
a
red
glow
streamed
from
its
windows
growing
strong
in
the
darkening
forest
that
is
their
kitchen
master
he
said
the
whole
house
is
kitchen
his
eyes
looked
eagerly
at
it
for
though
he
loved
bacon
he
welcomed
the
many
signs
of
a
dinner
of
boundless
variety
as
he
and
his
master
returned
to
the
long
hall
great
plates
of
polished
wood
were
being
laid
on
the
table
they
gave
rodriguez
a
place
on
the
right
of
the
great
chair
that
had
the
crown
of
the
forest
carved
on
the
back
whose
chair
is
that
said
rodriguez
the
king
of
shadow
valley
they
said
he
is
not
here
then
said
rodriguez
who
knows
said
a
bowman
it
is
his
chair
said
another
his
place
is
ready
none
knows
the
ways
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
he
comes
sometimes
at
this
hour
said
a
third
as
the
boar
comes
to
heather
pool
at
sunset
but
not
always
none
knows
his
ways
if
they
caught
the
king
said
another
the
forest
would
perish
none
loves
it
as
he
none
knows
its
ways
as
he
no
other
could
so
defend
it
alas
said
miguel
some
day
when
he
be
not
here
they
will
enter
the
forest
all
knew
whom
he
meant
by
they
and
the
goodly
trees
will
go
he
spoke
as
a
man
foretelling
the
end
of
the
world
and
as
men
to
whom
no
less
was
announced
the
others
listened
to
him
they
all
loved
shadow
valley
in
this
man
time
so
they
told
rodriguez
none
entered
the
forest
to
hurt
it
no
tree
was
cut
except
by
his
command
and
venturous
men
claiming
rights
from
others
than
him
seldom
laid
axe
long
to
tree
before
he
stood
near
stepping
noiselessly
from
among
shadows
of
trees
as
though
he
were
one
of
their
spirits
coming
for
vengeance
on
man
all
this
they
told
rodriguez
but
nothing
definite
they
told
of
their
king
where
he
was
yesterday
where
he
might
be
now
and
any
questions
he
asked
of
such
things
seemed
to
offend
a
law
of
the
forest
and
then
the
dishes
were
carried
in
to
morano
great
delight
with
wide
blue
eyes
he
watched
the
produce
of
that
mighty
estate
coming
in
through
the
doorway
cooked
boars
heads
woodcock
herons
plates
full
of
fishes
all
manner
of
small
eggs
a
and
some
rabbits
were
carried
in
by
procession
and
the
men
set
to
with
their
knives
each
handle
being
the
whole
tusk
of
a
boar
and
with
their
eating
came
merriment
and
tales
of
past
huntings
and
talk
of
the
forest
and
stories
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
always
they
spoke
of
him
not
only
with
respect
but
also
with
the
discretion
rodriguez
thought
of
men
that
spoke
of
one
who
might
be
behind
them
at
that
moment
and
one
who
tolerated
no
trifling
with
his
authority
then
they
sang
songs
again
such
as
rodriguez
had
heard
on
the
road
and
their
merry
lives
passed
clearly
before
his
mind
again
for
we
live
in
our
songs
as
no
men
live
in
histories
and
again
rodriguez
lamented
his
hard
ambition
and
his
long
vague
journey
turning
away
twice
from
happiness
once
in
the
village
of
lowlight
where
happiness
deserted
him
and
here
in
the
goodly
forest
where
he
jilted
happiness
how
well
could
he
and
morano
live
as
two
of
this
band
he
thought
leaving
all
cares
in
cities
for
there
dwelt
cares
in
cities
even
then
then
he
put
the
thought
away
and
as
the
evening
wore
away
with
merry
talk
and
with
song
rodriguez
turned
to
miguel
and
told
him
how
it
was
with
la
garda
and
broached
the
matter
of
horses
and
while
the
others
sang
miguel
spoke
sadly
to
him
master
he
said
la
garda
shall
never
take
you
in
shadow
valley
yet
if
you
must
leave
us
to
make
your
fortune
in
the
wars
though
your
fortune
waits
you
here
there
be
many
horses
in
the
forest
and
you
and
your
servant
shall
have
the
best
tomorrow
morning
señor
said
rodriguez
even
so
said
miguel
and
how
shall
i
send
them
to
you
again
said
rodriguez
master
they
are
yours
said
miguel
but
this
rodriguez
would
not
have
for
as
yet
he
only
guessed
what
claim
at
all
he
had
upon
shadow
valley
his
speculations
being
far
more
concerned
with
the
identity
of
the
hidalgo
that
he
had
fought
the
night
before
how
he
concerned
serafina
who
had
owned
the
rose
that
he
carried
in
fact
his
mind
was
busy
with
such
studies
as
were
proper
to
his
age
and
at
last
they
decided
between
them
on
the
house
of
a
lowland
smith
who
was
the
furthest
man
that
the
bowmen
knew
who
was
secretly
true
to
their
king
at
his
house
rodriguez
and
morano
should
leave
the
horses
he
dwelt
sixty
miles
from
the
northern
edge
of
the
forest
and
would
surely
give
rodriguez
fresh
horses
if
he
possessed
them
for
he
was
a
true
man
to
the
bowman
his
name
was
gonzalez
and
he
dwelt
in
a
queer
green
house
they
turned
then
to
listen
a
moment
to
a
hunting
song
that
all
the
bowmen
were
singing
about
the
death
of
a
boar
its
sheer
merriment
constrained
them
then
miguel
spoke
again
you
should
not
leave
the
forest
he
said
sadly
rodriguez
sighed
it
was
decided
then
miguel
told
him
of
his
road
which
ran
and
would
one
day
bring
him
out
of
spain
he
told
him
how
towns
on
the
way
and
the
river
ebro
and
with
awe
and
reverence
he
spoke
of
the
mighty
pyrenees
and
then
rodriguez
rose
for
the
start
was
to
be
at
dawn
and
walked
quietly
through
the
singing
out
of
the
hall
to
the
room
where
the
great
bed
was
and
soon
he
slept
and
his
dreams
joined
in
the
endless
hunt
through
shadow
valley
that
was
carved
all
round
the
timbers
of
his
bed
all
too
soon
he
heard
voices
voices
far
off
at
first
to
which
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
thus
he
woke
grudgingly
out
of
the
deeps
of
sleep
it
was
miguel
and
morano
calling
him
when
at
length
he
reached
the
hall
all
the
merriment
of
the
evening
was
gone
from
it
but
the
sober
beauty
of
the
forest
flooded
in
through
both
windows
with
early
sunlight
and
so
that
it
had
not
the
sad
appearance
of
places
in
which
we
have
rejoiced
when
we
revisit
them
next
day
or
next
generation
and
find
them
all
deserted
by
dance
and
song
rodriguez
ate
his
breakfast
while
the
bowmen
waited
with
their
bows
all
strung
by
the
door
when
he
was
ready
they
all
set
off
in
the
early
light
through
the
forest
rodriguez
did
not
criticise
his
ambition
it
sailed
too
high
above
his
logic
for
that
but
he
regretted
it
as
he
went
through
the
beauty
of
the
forest
among
these
happy
men
but
we
must
all
have
an
ambition
and
rodriguez
stuck
to
the
one
he
had
he
had
another
but
it
was
an
ambition
with
weak
wings
that
could
not
come
to
hope
it
depended
upon
the
first
if
he
could
win
a
castle
in
the
wars
he
felt
that
he
might
even
yet
hope
towards
lowlight
little
was
said
and
rodriguez
was
all
alone
with
his
thoughts
in
two
hours
they
met
a
bowman
holding
two
horses
they
had
gone
eight
miles
farewell
to
the
forest
said
miguel
to
rodriguez
there
was
almost
a
query
in
his
voice
would
rodriguez
really
leave
them
it
seemed
to
say
farewell
he
answered
morano
too
had
looked
sideways
towards
his
master
seeming
almost
to
wonder
what
his
answer
would
be
when
it
came
he
accepted
it
and
walked
to
the
horses
rodriguez
mounted
willing
hands
helped
up
morano
farewell
said
miguel
once
more
and
all
the
bowmen
shouted
farewell
make
my
farewell
said
rodriguez
to
the
king
of
shadow
valley
a
twig
cracked
in
the
forest
hark
said
miguel
maybe
that
was
a
boar
i
can
not
wait
to
hunt
said
rodriguez
for
i
have
far
to
go
maybe
said
miguel
it
was
the
king
farewell
to
you
rodriguez
looked
into
the
forest
and
saw
nothing
farewell
he
said
again
the
horses
were
fresh
and
he
let
his
go
morano
lumbered
behind
him
in
two
miles
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
up
a
rocky
hill
and
so
to
the
plains
again
and
one
more
adventure
lay
behind
them
rodriguez
turned
round
once
on
the
high
ground
and
took
a
long
look
back
on
the
green
undulations
of
peace
the
forest
slept
there
as
though
empty
of
men
then
they
rode
in
the
first
hour
easily
cantering
they
did
ten
miles
then
they
settled
down
to
what
those
of
our
age
and
country
and
occupation
know
as
a
which
is
seven
miles
an
hour
and
after
two
hours
they
let
the
horses
rest
it
was
the
hour
of
the
morano
having
dismounted
stretched
himself
dolefully
then
he
brought
out
all
manner
of
meats
rodriguez
looked
wonderingly
at
them
for
the
wars
master
said
morano
to
whatever
wars
they
went
the
green
bowmen
seemed
to
have
supplied
an
ample
commissariat
they
ate
and
rodriguez
thought
of
the
wars
for
the
thought
of
serafina
made
him
sad
and
his
rejection
of
the
life
of
the
forest
saddened
him
too
so
he
sought
to
draw
from
the
future
the
comfort
that
he
could
not
get
from
the
past
they
mounted
again
and
rode
again
for
three
hours
till
they
saw
very
far
off
on
a
hill
a
village
that
miguel
had
told
them
was
fifty
miles
from
the
forest
we
rest
the
night
there
said
rodriguez
pointing
though
it
was
yet
seven
or
eight
miles
away
all
the
saints
be
praised
said
morano
they
dismounted
then
and
went
on
foot
for
the
horses
were
weary
at
evening
they
rode
slowly
into
the
village
at
an
inn
whose
hospitable
looks
were
as
cheerfully
unlike
the
inn
of
the
dragon
and
knight
as
possible
they
demanded
lodging
for
all
four
they
went
first
to
the
stable
and
when
the
horses
had
been
handed
over
to
the
care
of
a
groom
they
returned
to
the
inn
and
mine
host
and
rodriguez
had
to
help
morano
up
the
three
steps
to
the
door
for
he
had
walked
nine
miles
that
day
and
ridden
fifty
and
he
was
too
weary
to
climb
the
steps
and
later
rodriguez
sat
down
alone
to
his
supper
at
a
table
well
and
variously
laden
for
the
doors
of
mine
hosts
larder
were
opened
wide
in
his
honour
but
rodriguez
ate
sparingly
as
do
weary
men
and
soon
he
sought
his
bed
and
on
the
old
echoing
stairs
as
he
and
mine
host
ascended
they
met
morano
leaning
against
the
wall
what
shall
i
say
of
morano
reader
your
sympathy
is
all
ready
to
go
out
to
the
poor
weary
man
he
does
not
entirely
deserve
it
and
shall
not
cheat
you
of
it
reader
morano
was
drunk
i
tell
you
this
sorry
truth
rather
than
that
the
knave
should
have
falsely
come
by
your
pity
and
yet
he
is
dead
now
over
three
hundred
years
having
had
his
good
time
to
the
full
does
he
deserve
your
pity
on
that
account
or
your
envy
and
to
whom
or
what
would
you
give
it
well
anyhow
he
deserved
no
pity
for
being
drunk
and
yet
he
was
thirsty
and
too
tired
to
eat
and
sore
in
need
of
refreshment
and
had
had
no
more
cause
to
learn
to
shun
good
wine
than
he
had
had
to
shun
the
smiles
of
princesses
and
there
the
good
wine
had
been
sparkling
beside
him
merrily
and
now
why
now
fatigued
as
he
had
been
an
hour
or
so
ago
but
time
had
lost
its
tiresome
restless
meaning
now
he
stood
firm
while
all
things
and
all
men
staggered
morano
said
rodriguez
as
he
passed
that
foolish
figure
we
go
sixty
miles
sixty
master
said
morano
a
hundred
two
hundred
it
is
best
to
rest
now
said
his
master
two
hundred
master
two
hundred
morano
replied
and
then
rodriguez
left
him
and
heard
him
muttering
his
challenge
to
distance
still
two
hundred
two
hundred
till
the
old
stairway
echoed
with
it
and
so
he
came
to
his
chamber
of
which
he
remembered
little
for
sleep
lurked
there
and
he
was
soon
with
dreams
faring
further
with
them
than
my
pen
can
follow
the
eighth
chronicle
how
he
travelled
far
one
blackbird
on
a
twig
near
rodriguez
window
sang
then
there
were
fifty
singing
and
morning
arose
over
spain
all
golden
and
wonderful
rodriguez
descended
and
found
mine
host
rubbing
his
hands
by
his
good
table
with
a
look
on
his
face
that
seemed
to
welcome
the
day
and
to
find
good
auguries
concerning
it
but
morano
looked
as
one
that
having
fallen
from
some
far
better
place
is
with
earth
and
the
mundane
way
he
had
scorned
breakfast
but
rodriguez
breakfasted
and
soon
the
two
were
bidding
mine
host
farewell
they
found
their
horses
saddled
they
mounted
at
once
and
rode
off
slowly
in
the
early
day
the
horses
were
tired
and
slowly
trotting
and
walking
and
sometimes
dismounting
and
dragging
the
horses
on
it
was
nearly
two
hours
before
they
had
done
ten
miles
and
come
to
the
house
of
the
smith
in
a
rocky
village
the
street
was
cobbled
and
the
houses
were
all
of
stone
the
early
sparkle
had
gone
from
the
dew
but
it
was
still
morning
and
many
a
man
but
now
sat
down
to
his
breakfast
as
they
arrived
and
beat
on
the
door
gonzalez
the
smith
opened
it
a
round
and
ruddy
man
past
fifty
a
citizen
following
a
reputable
trade
but
once
ah
once
a
bowman
señor
said
rodriguez
our
horses
are
weary
we
have
been
told
you
will
change
them
for
us
who
told
you
that
said
gonzalez
the
green
bowmen
in
shadow
valley
the
young
man
answered
as
a
meteor
at
night
lights
up
with
its
greenish
glare
flowers
and
blades
of
grass
twisting
long
shadows
behind
them
lights
up
lawns
and
bushes
and
the
deep
places
of
woods
scattering
quiet
night
for
a
moment
so
the
unexpected
answer
of
rodriguez
lit
memories
in
the
mind
of
the
smith
all
down
the
long
years
and
a
twinkle
and
a
sparkle
of
those
memories
dancing
in
woods
long
forsaken
flashed
from
his
eyes
the
green
bowmen
señor
said
gonzalez
ah
shadow
valley
we
left
it
yesterday
said
rodriguez
when
gonzalez
heard
this
he
poured
forth
questions
the
forest
señor
how
is
it
now
with
the
forest
do
the
boars
still
drink
at
heather
pool
do
the
geese
go
still
to
greatmarsh
they
should
have
come
early
this
year
how
is
it
with
larios
raphael
migada
who
shoots
woodcock
now
the
questions
flowed
on
past
answering
past
remembering
he
had
not
spoken
of
the
forest
for
years
and
rodriguez
answered
as
such
questions
are
always
answered
saying
that
all
was
well
and
giving
gonzalez
some
little
detail
of
some
trifling
affair
of
the
forest
which
he
treasured
as
small
shells
are
treasured
in
inland
places
when
travellers
bring
them
from
the
sea
but
all
that
he
heard
of
the
forest
seemed
to
the
smith
like
something
gathered
on
a
far
shore
of
time
yes
he
had
been
a
bowman
once
but
he
had
no
horses
one
horse
that
drew
a
cart
but
no
horses
for
riding
at
all
and
rodriguez
thought
of
the
immense
miles
lying
between
him
and
the
foreign
land
keeping
him
back
from
his
ambition
they
all
pressed
on
his
mind
at
once
the
smith
was
sorry
but
he
could
not
make
horses
show
him
your
coin
master
said
morano
ah
a
small
token
said
rodriguez
drawing
it
forth
still
on
its
green
ribbon
under
his
clothing
the
bowman
badge
is
it
not
gonzalez
looked
at
it
then
looked
at
rodriguez
master
he
said
you
shall
have
your
horses
give
me
time
you
shall
have
them
enter
master
and
he
bowed
and
widely
opened
the
door
if
you
will
breakfast
in
my
house
while
i
go
to
the
neighbours
you
shall
have
some
horses
master
so
they
entered
the
house
and
the
smith
with
many
bows
gave
the
travellers
over
to
the
care
of
his
wife
who
saw
from
her
manner
that
these
were
persons
of
importance
and
as
such
she
treated
them
both
and
as
such
entertained
them
to
their
second
breakfast
and
this
meant
they
ate
heartily
as
travellers
can
who
can
go
without
a
breakfast
or
eat
two
and
those
who
dwell
in
cities
can
do
neither
and
while
the
plump
dame
did
them
honour
they
spoke
no
word
of
the
forest
for
they
knew
not
what
place
her
husband
early
years
had
in
her
imagination
they
had
barely
finished
their
meal
when
the
sound
of
hooves
on
cobbles
was
heard
and
gonzalez
beat
on
the
door
they
all
went
to
the
door
and
found
him
there
with
two
horses
the
horses
were
saddled
and
bridled
they
fixed
the
stirrups
to
please
them
then
the
travellers
mounted
at
once
rodriguez
made
his
grateful
farewell
to
the
wife
of
the
smith
then
turning
to
gonzalez
he
pointed
to
the
two
tired
horses
which
had
waited
all
the
while
with
their
reins
thrown
over
a
hook
on
the
wall
let
the
owner
of
these
have
them
till
his
own
come
back
he
said
and
added
how
far
may
i
take
these
they
are
good
horses
said
the
smith
yes
said
rodriguez
they
could
do
fifty
miles
gonzalez
continued
and
why
forty
or
a
little
more
and
where
will
that
bring
me
said
rodriguez
pointing
to
the
straight
road
which
was
going
his
way
that
said
gonzalez
that
should
bring
you
some
ten
or
twenty
miles
short
of
saspe
and
where
shall
i
leave
the
horses
rodriguez
asked
master
gonzalez
said
in
any
village
where
there
be
a
smith
if
you
say
are
the
horses
of
the
smith
gonzalez
who
will
come
for
them
one
day
from
here
they
will
take
them
in
for
you
master
but
and
gonzalez
walked
a
little
away
from
his
wife
and
the
horses
walked
and
he
went
beside
them
north
of
here
none
knows
the
bowmen
you
will
get
no
fresh
horses
master
what
will
you
do
walk
said
rodriguez
then
they
said
farewell
and
there
was
a
look
on
the
face
of
the
smith
almost
such
as
the
sons
of
men
might
have
worn
in
genesis
when
angels
visited
them
briefly
they
settled
down
into
a
steady
trot
and
trotted
thus
for
three
hours
noon
came
and
still
there
was
no
rest
for
morano
but
only
dust
and
the
monotonous
sight
of
the
road
on
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
nearly
an
hour
more
passed
and
at
last
he
saw
his
master
halt
and
turn
round
in
his
saddle
dinner
rodriguez
said
all
morano
weariness
vanished
it
was
the
hour
of
the
once
more
they
had
done
more
than
miles
from
the
house
of
gonzalez
nimbly
enough
in
his
joy
at
feeling
the
ground
again
morano
ran
and
gathered
sticks
from
the
bushes
and
soon
he
had
a
fire
and
a
thin
column
of
grey
smoke
going
up
from
it
that
to
him
was
always
home
when
the
warmed
and
lard
sizzled
when
the
smell
of
bacon
mingled
with
the
smoke
then
morano
was
where
all
wise
men
and
all
unwise
try
to
be
and
where
some
of
one
or
the
other
some
times
come
for
awhile
by
unthought
paths
and
are
gone
again
for
that
smoky
mixed
odour
was
happiness
not
for
long
men
and
horses
rested
for
soon
rodriguez
ambition
was
drawing
him
down
the
road
again
of
which
he
knew
that
there
remained
to
be
travelled
over
two
hundred
miles
in
spain
and
how
much
beyond
that
he
knew
not
nor
greatly
cared
for
beyond
the
frontier
of
spain
he
believed
there
lay
the
dim
desired
country
of
romance
where
roads
were
long
no
more
and
no
rain
fell
they
mounted
again
and
pushed
on
for
this
country
not
a
village
they
saw
but
that
morano
hoped
that
here
his
affliction
would
end
and
that
he
would
dismount
and
rest
and
always
rodriguez
rode
on
and
morano
followed
and
with
a
barking
of
dogs
they
were
gone
and
the
village
rested
behind
them
for
many
an
hour
their
slow
trot
carried
them
on
and
morano
clutching
the
saddle
with
worn
arms
already
was
close
to
despair
when
rodriguez
halted
in
a
little
village
at
evening
before
an
inn
they
had
done
their
fifty
miles
from
the
house
of
gonzalez
and
even
a
little
more
morano
rolled
from
his
horse
and
beat
on
the
small
green
door
mine
host
came
out
and
eyed
them
preening
the
point
of
his
beard
and
rodriguez
sat
his
horse
and
looked
at
him
they
had
not
the
welcome
here
that
gonzalez
gave
them
but
there
was
a
room
to
spare
for
rodriguez
and
morano
was
promised
what
he
asked
for
straw
and
there
was
shelter
to
be
had
for
the
horses
it
was
all
the
travellers
needed
children
peered
at
the
strangers
gossips
peeped
out
of
doors
to
gather
material
concerning
them
dogs
noted
their
coming
the
eyes
of
the
little
village
watched
them
curiously
but
rodriguez
and
morano
passed
into
the
house
unheeding
and
past
those
two
tired
men
the
mellow
evening
glided
by
like
a
dream
tired
though
rodriguez
was
he
noticed
a
certain
politeness
in
mine
host
while
he
waited
at
supper
which
had
not
been
noticeable
when
he
had
first
received
him
and
rightly
put
this
down
to
some
talk
of
morano
but
he
did
not
guess
that
morano
had
opened
wide
blue
eyes
and
babbling
to
his
host
had
guilelessly
told
him
that
his
master
a
week
ago
had
killed
an
uncivil
scarcely
were
late
birds
home
before
rodriguez
sought
his
bed
and
not
all
of
them
were
sleeping
before
he
slept
another
morning
shone
and
appeared
to
spain
and
all
at
once
rodriguez
was
wide
awake
it
was
the
eighth
day
of
his
wanderings
when
he
had
breakfasted
and
paid
his
due
in
silver
he
and
morano
departed
leaving
mine
host
upon
his
doorstep
bowing
with
an
almost
perplexed
look
on
his
shrewd
face
as
he
took
the
points
of
moustachios
and
beard
lightly
in
turn
between
finger
and
thumb
for
we
of
our
day
enter
vague
details
about
ourselves
in
the
book
downstairs
when
we
stay
at
inns
but
it
was
mine
host
custom
to
gather
all
that
with
his
sharp
eyes
whatever
he
gathered
rodriguez
and
morano
were
gone
but
soon
their
pace
dwindled
the
trot
slackening
and
falling
to
a
walk
soon
rodriguez
learned
what
it
is
to
travel
with
tired
horses
to
morano
riding
was
merely
riding
and
the
discomforts
of
that
were
so
great
that
he
noticed
no
difference
but
to
rodriguez
his
continual
hitting
and
kicking
his
horse
sides
his
dislike
of
doing
it
the
uselessness
of
it
when
done
his
ambition
before
and
the
tired
beast
underneath
the
body
always
some
yards
behind
the
beckoning
spirit
were
as
great
vexation
as
a
traveller
knows
it
came
to
dismounting
and
walking
miles
on
foot
even
then
the
horses
hung
back
they
halted
an
hour
over
dinner
while
the
horses
grazed
and
rested
and
they
returned
to
their
road
refreshed
by
the
magic
that
was
in
the
but
the
horses
were
no
fresher
when
our
bodies
are
slothful
and
lie
heavy
never
responding
to
the
spirit
bright
promptings
then
we
know
dullness
and
the
burden
of
it
is
the
graver
for
hearing
our
spirits
call
faintly
as
the
chains
of
a
buccaneer
in
some
deep
prison
who
hears
a
snatch
of
his
singing
as
they
ride
free
by
the
coast
would
grow
more
unbearable
than
ever
before
but
the
weight
of
his
tired
horse
seemed
to
hang
heavier
on
the
fanciful
hopes
that
rodriguez
dreams
had
made
farther
than
ever
seemed
the
pyrenees
huger
than
ever
their
barrier
dimmer
and
dimmer
grew
the
lands
of
romance
if
the
hopes
of
rodriguez
were
low
if
his
fancies
were
faint
what
material
have
i
left
with
which
to
make
a
story
with
glitter
enough
to
hold
my
readers
eyes
to
the
page
for
know
that
mere
dreams
and
idle
fancies
and
all
amorous
lyrical
unsubstantial
things
are
all
that
we
writers
have
of
which
to
make
a
tale
as
they
are
all
that
the
dim
ones
have
to
make
the
story
of
man
sometimes
riding
sometimes
going
on
foot
with
the
thought
of
the
long
long
miles
always
crowding
upon
rodriguez
overwhelming
his
hopes
till
even
the
castle
he
was
to
win
in
the
wars
grew
too
pale
for
his
fancy
to
see
tired
and
without
illusions
they
came
at
last
by
starlight
to
the
glow
of
a
smith
forge
he
must
have
done
miles
and
he
knew
they
were
near
caspe
the
smith
was
working
late
and
looked
up
when
rodriguez
halted
yes
he
knew
gonzalez
a
master
in
the
trade
there
was
a
welcome
for
his
horses
but
for
the
two
human
travellers
there
were
excuses
even
apologies
but
no
spare
beds
it
was
the
same
in
the
next
three
or
four
houses
that
stood
together
by
the
road
and
the
fever
of
rodriguez
ambition
drove
him
on
though
morano
would
have
lain
down
and
slept
where
they
stood
though
he
himself
was
weary
the
smith
had
received
his
horses
after
that
he
cared
not
whether
they
gave
him
shelter
or
not
the
alternative
being
the
road
and
that
bringing
nearer
his
wars
and
the
castle
he
was
to
win
and
that
fancy
that
led
his
master
morano
allowed
always
to
lead
him
too
though
a
few
more
miles
and
he
would
have
fallen
asleep
as
he
walked
and
dropped
by
the
roadside
and
slept
on
luckily
they
had
gone
barely
two
miles
from
the
forge
where
the
horses
rested
when
they
saw
a
high
dark
house
by
the
road
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
found
shelter
it
was
an
old
woman
who
let
them
in
a
wife
and
she
had
room
for
them
and
one
mattress
but
no
bed
they
were
too
tired
to
eat
and
did
not
ask
for
food
but
at
once
followed
her
up
the
booming
stairs
of
her
house
which
were
all
dark
but
for
her
candle
and
so
came
among
huge
minuetting
shadows
to
the
long
loft
at
the
top
there
was
a
mattress
there
which
the
old
woman
laid
out
for
rodriguez
and
a
heap
of
hay
for
morano
just
for
a
moment
as
rodriguez
climbed
the
last
step
of
the
stair
and
entered
the
loft
where
the
huge
shadows
twirled
between
the
one
candle
light
and
the
unbeaten
darkness
in
corners
just
for
a
moment
romance
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
for
a
moment
in
spite
of
his
fatigue
and
dejection
in
spite
of
the
possibility
of
his
quest
being
crazy
for
a
moment
he
felt
that
great
shadows
and
echoing
boards
the
very
cobwebs
even
that
hung
from
the
black
rafters
were
all
romantic
things
he
felt
that
his
was
a
glorious
adventure
and
that
all
these
things
that
filled
the
loft
in
the
night
were
such
as
should
fitly
attend
on
youth
and
glory
in
a
moment
that
feeling
was
gone
he
knew
not
why
it
had
come
and
though
he
remembered
it
till
grey
old
age
when
he
came
to
know
the
causes
of
many
things
he
never
knew
what
romance
might
have
to
do
with
shadows
or
echoes
at
night
in
an
empty
room
and
only
knew
of
such
fancies
that
they
came
from
beyond
his
understanding
whether
from
wisdom
or
folly
morano
was
first
asleep
as
enormous
snores
testified
almost
before
the
echoes
had
died
away
of
the
footsteps
of
the
old
woman
descending
the
stairs
but
soon
rodriguez
followed
him
into
the
region
of
dreams
where
fantastic
ambitions
can
live
with
less
of
a
struggle
than
in
the
broad
light
of
day
he
dreamed
he
walked
at
night
down
a
street
of
castles
strangely
colossal
in
an
awful
starlight
with
doors
too
vast
for
any
human
need
whose
battlements
were
far
in
the
heights
of
night
and
chose
it
being
in
time
of
war
the
one
that
should
be
his
but
the
gargoyles
on
it
were
angry
and
spoiled
the
dream
dream
followed
dream
with
furious
rapidity
as
the
dreams
of
tired
men
do
racing
each
other
jostling
and
mingling
and
dancing
an
company
myriads
went
by
a
wild
grey
cloudy
multitude
and
with
the
last
walked
dawn
rodriguez
rose
more
relieved
to
quit
so
tumultuous
a
rest
than
refreshed
by
having
had
it
he
descended
leaving
morano
to
sleep
on
and
not
till
the
old
dame
had
made
a
breakfast
ready
did
he
return
to
interrupt
his
snores
even
as
he
awoke
upon
his
heap
of
hay
morano
remained
as
true
to
his
master
fantastic
quest
as
the
camel
is
true
to
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
he
awoke
grumbling
as
the
camel
grumbles
at
dawn
when
the
packs
are
put
on
him
where
he
lies
but
never
did
he
doubt
that
they
went
to
victorious
wars
where
his
master
would
win
a
castle
splendid
with
towers
breakfast
cheered
both
the
travellers
and
then
the
old
lady
told
rodriguez
that
caspe
was
but
a
three
hours
walk
and
that
cheered
them
even
more
for
caspe
is
on
the
ebro
which
seemed
to
mark
for
rodriguez
a
stage
in
his
journey
being
carried
easily
in
his
imagination
like
the
pyrenees
what
road
he
would
take
when
he
reached
caspe
he
had
not
planned
and
soon
rodriguez
expressed
his
gratitude
full
of
fervour
with
many
a
flowery
phrase
which
lived
long
in
the
old
dame
mind
and
the
visit
of
those
two
travellers
became
one
of
the
strange
events
of
that
house
and
was
chief
of
the
memories
that
faintly
haunted
the
rafters
of
the
loft
for
years
they
did
not
reach
caspe
in
three
hours
but
went
lazily
being
weary
for
however
long
a
man
defies
fatigue
the
hour
comes
when
it
claims
him
the
knowledge
that
caspe
lay
near
with
sure
lodging
for
the
night
soothed
rodriguez
impatience
and
as
they
loitered
they
talked
and
they
decided
that
la
garda
must
now
be
too
far
behind
to
pursue
any
longer
they
came
in
four
hours
to
the
bank
of
the
ebro
and
there
saw
caspe
near
them
but
they
dined
once
more
on
the
grass
sitting
beside
the
river
rather
than
enter
the
town
at
once
for
there
had
grown
in
both
travellers
a
liking
for
the
wanderers
green
table
of
earth
it
was
a
time
to
make
plans
the
country
of
romance
was
far
away
and
they
were
without
horses
will
you
buy
horses
master
said
morano
we
might
not
get
them
over
the
pyrenees
said
rodriguez
though
he
had
a
better
reason
which
was
that
three
gold
pieces
did
not
buy
two
saddled
horses
there
were
no
more
friends
to
hire
from
morano
grew
thoughtful
he
sat
with
his
feet
dangling
over
the
bank
of
the
ebro
master
he
said
after
a
while
this
river
goes
our
way
let
us
come
by
boat
master
and
drift
down
to
france
at
our
ease
to
get
a
river
over
a
range
of
mountains
is
harder
than
to
get
horses
some
such
difficulty
rodriguez
implied
to
him
but
morano
having
come
slowly
by
an
idea
parted
not
so
easily
with
it
it
goes
our
way
master
he
repeated
and
pointed
a
finger
at
the
ebro
at
this
moment
a
certain
song
that
boatmen
sing
on
that
river
when
the
current
is
with
them
and
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
be
idle
and
their
lazy
thoughts
run
to
lascivious
things
came
to
the
ears
of
rodriguez
and
morano
and
a
man
with
a
bright
blue
sash
steered
down
the
ebro
he
had
been
fishing
and
was
returning
home
master
morano
said
that
knave
shall
row
us
there
rodriguez
seeing
that
the
idea
was
fixed
in
morano
mind
determined
that
events
would
move
it
sooner
than
argument
and
so
made
no
reply
shall
i
tell
him
master
asked
morano
yes
said
rodriguez
if
he
can
row
us
over
the
pyrenees
this
was
the
permission
that
morano
sought
and
a
hideous
yell
broke
from
his
throat
hailing
the
boatman
the
boatman
looked
up
lazily
a
young
man
with
strong
brown
arms
turning
black
moustaches
towards
morano
again
morano
hailed
him
and
ran
along
the
bank
while
the
boat
drifted
down
and
the
boatman
steered
in
towards
morano
somehow
morano
persuaded
him
to
come
in
to
see
what
he
wanted
and
in
a
creek
he
ran
his
boat
aground
and
there
he
and
morano
argued
and
bargained
but
rodriguez
remained
where
he
was
wondering
why
it
took
so
long
to
turn
his
servant
mind
from
that
curious
fancy
at
last
morano
returned
well
said
rodriguez
master
said
morano
he
will
row
us
to
the
pyrenees
the
pyrenees
said
rodriguez
the
ebro
runs
into
the
sea
for
they
had
taught
him
this
at
the
college
of
san
josephus
he
will
row
us
there
said
morano
for
a
gold
piece
a
day
rowing
five
hours
each
day
now
between
them
they
had
but
four
gold
pieces
but
that
did
not
make
the
ebro
run
northward
it
seemed
that
the
ebro
after
going
their
way
as
morano
had
said
for
twenty
or
thirty
miles
was
joined
by
the
river
segre
and
that
where
the
ebro
left
them
turning
eastwards
the
course
of
the
segre
took
them
on
their
way
but
it
would
be
rowing
against
the
current
how
far
is
it
said
rodriguez
a
hundred
miles
he
says
answered
morano
he
knows
it
well
rodriguez
calculated
swiftly
first
he
added
thirty
miles
for
he
knew
that
his
countrymen
took
a
cheerful
view
of
distance
seldom
allowing
any
distance
to
oppress
them
under
its
true
name
at
the
out
set
of
a
journey
then
he
guessed
that
the
boatman
might
row
five
miles
an
hour
for
the
first
thirty
miles
with
the
stream
of
the
ebro
and
he
hoped
that
he
might
row
three
against
the
segre
until
they
came
near
the
mountains
where
the
current
might
grow
too
strong
morano
he
said
we
shall
have
to
row
too
row
master
said
morano
we
can
pay
him
for
four
days
said
rodriguez
if
we
all
row
we
may
go
far
on
our
way
it
is
better
than
riding
replied
morano
with
entire
resignation
and
so
they
walked
to
the
creek
and
rodriguez
greeted
the
boatman
whose
name
was
perez
and
they
entered
the
boat
and
he
rowed
them
down
to
caspe
and
in
the
house
of
perez
rodriguez
slept
that
night
in
a
large
dim
room
untidy
with
diverse
wares
they
slept
on
heaps
of
things
that
pertained
to
the
river
and
fishing
yet
it
was
late
before
rodriguez
slept
for
in
sight
of
his
mind
came
glimpses
at
last
of
the
end
of
his
journey
and
when
he
slept
at
last
he
saw
the
pyrenees
through
the
long
night
their
mighty
heads
rejected
him
staring
immeasurably
beyond
him
in
silence
and
then
in
happier
dreams
they
beckoned
him
for
a
moment
till
at
last
a
bird
that
had
entered
the
city
of
caspe
sang
clear
and
it
was
dawn
with
that
first
light
rodriguez
arose
and
awoke
morano
together
they
left
that
long
haven
of
lumber
and
found
perez
already
stirring
they
ate
hastily
and
all
went
down
to
the
boat
the
unknown
that
waits
at
the
end
of
all
strange
journeys
quickening
their
steps
as
they
went
through
the
early
light
perez
rowed
first
and
the
others
took
their
turns
and
so
they
went
all
the
morning
down
the
broad
flood
of
the
ebro
and
came
in
the
afternoon
to
its
meeting
place
with
the
segre
and
there
they
landed
and
stretched
their
limbs
on
shore
and
lit
a
fire
and
feasted
before
they
faced
the
current
that
would
be
henceforth
against
them
then
they
rowed
on
when
they
landed
by
starlight
and
unrolled
a
sheet
of
canvas
that
perez
had
put
in
the
boat
and
found
what
a
bad
time
starlight
is
for
pitching
a
tent
rodriguez
and
morano
had
rowed
for
four
hours
each
and
perez
had
rowed
for
five
they
carried
no
timber
in
the
boat
but
used
the
oars
for
and
cut
with
a
small
hatchet
that
perez
had
brought
they
stumbled
on
rocks
tore
the
canvas
on
bushes
lost
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
in
fact
they
were
learning
the
craft
of
wandering
yet
at
last
their
tent
was
up
and
a
good
fire
comforting
them
outside
and
morano
had
cooked
the
food
and
they
had
supped
and
talked
and
after
that
they
slept
and
over
them
sleeping
the
starlight
faded
away
and
in
the
greyness
that
none
of
them
dreamed
was
dawn
five
clear
notes
were
heard
so
shrill
in
the
night
that
rodriguez
half
waking
wondered
what
bird
of
the
darkness
called
and
learned
from
the
answering
chorus
that
it
was
day
he
woke
morano
who
rose
in
that
chilly
hour
and
striking
sparks
among
last
night
embers
soon
had
a
fire
they
hastily
made
a
meal
and
wrapped
up
their
tent
and
soon
they
were
going
onward
against
the
tide
of
the
segre
and
that
day
morano
rowed
more
skilfully
and
rodriguez
unwrapped
his
mandolin
and
played
reclining
in
the
boat
while
he
rested
from
rowing
and
the
mandolin
told
them
all
what
the
words
of
none
could
say
that
they
fared
to
adventure
in
the
land
of
romance
to
the
overthrow
of
dullness
and
the
sameness
of
all
drear
schemes
and
the
conquest
of
discontent
in
the
spirit
of
man
and
perhaps
it
sang
of
a
time
that
has
not
yet
come
or
the
mandolin
lied
that
evening
three
wiser
men
made
their
camp
before
starlight
they
were
now
far
up
the
segre
for
thirteen
hours
next
day
they
toiled
at
the
oars
or
lay
languid
and
while
rodriguez
rested
he
played
on
his
mandolin
the
segre
slipped
by
them
they
seemed
like
no
men
on
their
way
to
war
but
seemed
to
loiter
as
the
bright
river
loitered
which
slid
seaward
in
careless
ease
and
was
wholly
freed
from
time
on
this
day
they
heard
men
speak
of
the
pyrenees
two
men
and
a
woman
walking
by
the
river
their
voices
came
to
the
boat
across
the
water
and
they
spoke
of
the
pyrenees
and
on
the
next
day
they
heard
men
speak
of
war
war
that
some
farmers
had
fled
from
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
when
rodriguez
heard
these
chance
words
his
dreams
came
nearer
till
they
almost
touched
the
edges
of
reality
it
was
the
last
day
of
perez
rowing
he
rowed
well
although
they
neared
the
cradle
of
the
segre
and
he
struggled
against
them
in
his
youth
grey
peaks
began
to
peer
that
had
nursed
that
river
grey
faces
of
stone
began
to
look
over
green
hills
they
were
the
pyrenees
when
rodriguez
saw
at
last
the
pyrenees
he
drew
a
breath
and
was
unable
to
speak
soon
they
were
gone
again
below
the
hills
they
had
but
peered
for
a
moment
to
see
who
troubled
the
segre
and
the
sun
set
and
still
they
did
not
camp
but
perez
rowed
on
into
the
starlight
that
day
he
rowed
six
hours
they
pitched
their
tent
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
darkness
and
breathing
a
clear
new
air
all
crisp
from
the
pyrenees
they
slept
outside
the
threshold
of
adventure
rodriguez
awoke
cold
once
more
he
heard
the
first
blackbird
who
sings
clear
at
the
edge
of
night
all
alone
in
the
greyness
the
only
rival
a
rival
like
some
unknown
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
who
for
a
moment
leads
some
song
in
notes
more
liquid
than
a
and
all
the
crowd
joins
in
and
his
voice
is
lost
and
no
one
learns
his
name
at
once
a
host
of
birds
answered
him
out
of
dim
bushes
whose
shapes
had
barely
as
yet
emerged
from
night
and
in
this
chorus
perez
awoke
and
even
morano
they
all
three
breakfasted
together
and
then
the
wanderers
said
to
perez
and
soon
he
was
gone
with
his
bright
blue
sash
drifting
homewards
with
the
segre
well
paid
yet
singing
a
little
sadly
as
he
drifted
for
he
had
been
one
of
a
quest
and
now
he
left
it
at
the
edge
of
adventure
near
solemn
mountains
and
beyond
them
romantic
lands
so
perez
left
and
rodriguez
and
morano
turned
again
to
the
road
all
the
more
lightly
because
they
had
not
done
a
full
day
march
for
so
long
and
now
a
great
one
unrolled
its
leagues
before
them
the
heads
of
the
mountains
showed
themselves
again
they
tramped
as
in
the
early
days
of
their
quest
and
as
they
went
the
mountains
unveiling
themselves
slowly
dropping
film
after
film
of
distance
that
hid
their
mighty
forms
gradually
revealed
to
the
wanderers
the
magnificence
of
their
beauty
till
at
evening
rodriguez
and
morano
stood
on
a
low
hill
looking
at
that
tremendous
range
which
lifted
far
above
the
fields
of
earth
as
though
its
mountains
were
no
earthly
things
but
sat
with
fate
and
watched
us
and
did
not
care
rodriguez
and
morano
stood
and
gazed
in
silence
they
had
come
twenty
miles
since
morning
they
were
tired
and
hungry
but
the
mountains
held
them
they
stood
there
looking
neither
for
rest
nor
food
beyond
them
sheltering
under
the
low
hills
they
saw
a
little
village
smoke
straggled
up
from
it
high
into
the
evening
beyond
the
village
woods
sloped
away
upwards
but
far
above
smoke
or
woods
the
bare
peaks
brooded
rodriguez
gazed
on
their
austere
solemnity
wondering
what
secret
they
guarded
there
for
so
long
guessing
what
message
they
held
and
hid
from
man
until
he
learned
that
the
mystery
they
guarded
among
them
was
of
things
that
he
knew
not
and
could
never
know
said
the
bells
of
a
church
invisible
among
the
houses
of
that
far
village
said
the
crescent
of
hills
that
sheltered
it
and
after
a
while
speaking
out
of
their
grim
and
enormous
silences
with
all
the
gravity
of
their
hundred
ages
said
the
mountains
with
this
trivial
message
echo
returned
from
among
the
homes
of
the
mighty
where
she
had
run
with
the
small
bell
tiny
cry
to
trouble
their
crowned
aloofness
rodriguez
and
morano
pressed
on
and
the
mountains
cloaked
themselves
as
they
went
in
air
of
many
colours
till
the
stars
came
out
and
the
lights
of
the
village
gleamed
in
darkness
with
surprise
in
the
tones
of
the
barking
dogs
the
two
wanderers
came
to
the
village
where
so
few
ever
came
for
it
lay
at
the
end
of
spain
cut
off
by
those
mighty
rocks
and
they
knew
not
much
of
what
lands
lay
beyond
they
beat
on
a
door
below
a
hanging
board
on
which
was
written
the
inn
of
the
world
end
a
wandering
scholar
had
written
it
and
had
been
well
paid
for
his
work
for
in
those
days
writing
was
rare
the
door
was
opened
for
them
by
the
host
of
the
inn
and
they
entered
a
room
in
which
men
who
had
supped
were
sitting
at
a
table
they
were
all
of
them
men
from
the
spanish
side
of
the
mountains
farmers
come
into
the
village
on
the
affairs
of
mother
earth
next
day
they
would
be
back
at
their
farms
again
and
of
the
land
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
that
was
so
near
now
they
knew
nothing
so
that
it
still
remained
for
the
wanderers
a
thing
of
mystery
wherein
romance
could
dwell
and
because
they
knew
nothing
of
that
land
the
men
at
the
inn
treasured
all
the
more
the
rumours
that
sometimes
came
from
it
and
of
these
they
talked
and
mine
host
listened
eagerly
to
whom
all
tales
were
brought
soon
or
late
and
most
he
loved
to
hear
tales
from
beyond
the
mountains
rodriguez
and
morano
sat
still
and
listened
and
the
talk
was
all
of
war
it
was
faint
and
vague
like
fable
but
rumour
clearly
said
war
and
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
it
may
be
that
no
man
has
a
crazy
ambition
without
at
moments
suspecting
it
but
prove
it
by
the
touchstone
of
fact
and
he
becomes
at
once
as
a
woman
whose
invalid
son
after
years
of
seclusion
indoors
wins
unexpectedly
some
athletic
prize
when
rodriguez
heard
all
this
talk
of
wars
quite
near
he
thought
of
his
castle
as
already
won
his
thoughts
went
further
even
floating
through
lowlight
in
the
glowing
evening
and
drifting
up
and
down
past
serafina
house
below
the
balcony
where
she
sat
for
ever
some
said
the
duke
would
never
attack
the
prince
because
the
aunt
was
a
princess
from
the
troubadour
country
another
said
that
there
would
surely
be
war
others
said
that
there
was
war
already
and
too
late
for
man
to
stop
it
all
said
it
would
soon
be
over
and
one
man
said
that
it
was
the
last
war
that
would
come
because
gunpowder
made
fighting
impossible
it
could
smite
a
man
down
he
said
at
two
hundred
paces
and
a
man
be
slain
not
knowing
whom
he
fought
some
loved
fighting
and
some
loved
peace
he
said
but
gunpowder
suited
none
i
like
not
the
sound
of
that
gunpowder
master
said
morano
to
rodriguez
nobody
likes
it
said
the
man
at
the
table
it
is
the
end
of
war
and
some
sighed
and
some
were
glad
but
rodriguez
determined
to
push
on
before
the
last
war
was
over
next
morning
rodriguez
paid
the
last
of
his
silver
pieces
and
set
off
with
morano
before
any
but
mine
host
were
astir
there
was
nothing
but
the
mountains
in
front
of
them
they
climbed
all
the
morning
and
they
came
to
the
fir
woods
there
they
lit
a
good
fire
and
morano
brought
out
his
over
the
meal
they
took
stock
of
their
provisions
and
found
that
for
all
the
store
morano
had
brought
from
the
forest
they
had
now
only
food
for
three
days
and
they
were
quite
without
money
money
in
those
uplifted
wastes
seemed
trivial
but
the
dwindling
food
told
rodriguez
that
he
must
press
on
for
man
came
among
those
rocky
monsters
supplied
with
all
his
needs
or
perished
unnoticed
before
their
stony
faces
all
the
afternoon
they
passed
through
the
fir
woods
and
as
shadows
began
to
grow
long
they
passed
the
last
tree
the
village
and
all
the
fields
about
it
and
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
were
all
spread
out
below
them
like
little
trivial
things
dimly
remembered
from
very
long
ago
by
one
whose
memory
weakens
distance
had
dwarfed
them
and
the
cold
regard
of
those
mighty
peaks
ignored
them
and
then
a
shadow
fell
on
the
village
then
tiny
lights
shone
out
it
was
night
down
there
still
the
two
wanderers
climbed
on
in
the
daylight
with
their
faces
to
the
rocks
they
scarce
saw
night
climb
up
behind
them
but
when
rodriguez
looked
up
at
the
sky
to
see
how
much
light
was
left
and
met
the
calm
gaze
of
the
evening
star
he
saw
that
night
and
the
peaks
were
met
together
and
understood
all
at
once
how
puny
an
intruder
is
man
morano
said
rodriguez
we
must
rest
here
for
the
night
morano
looked
round
him
with
an
air
of
discontent
not
with
his
master
words
but
with
the
rocks
angular
hardness
there
was
scarce
a
plant
of
any
kind
near
them
now
they
were
near
the
snow
which
had
flushed
like
a
wild
rose
at
sunset
but
was
now
all
grey
grey
cliffs
seemed
to
be
gazing
sheer
at
eternity
and
here
was
man
the
creature
of
a
moment
who
had
strayed
in
the
cold
all
homeless
among
his
betters
there
was
no
welcome
for
them
there
whatever
feeling
great
mountains
evoke
that
feeling
was
clear
in
rodriguez
and
morano
they
were
all
amongst
those
that
have
other
aims
other
ends
and
know
naught
of
man
a
bitter
chill
from
the
snow
and
from
starry
space
drove
this
thought
home
they
walked
on
looking
for
a
better
place
as
men
will
but
found
none
and
at
last
they
lay
down
on
the
cold
earth
under
a
rock
that
seemed
to
give
shelter
from
the
wind
and
there
sought
sleep
but
cold
came
instead
and
sleep
kept
far
from
the
tremendous
presences
of
the
peaks
of
the
pyrenees
that
gazed
on
things
far
from
here
an
ageing
moon
arose
and
rodriguez
touched
morano
and
rose
up
and
the
two
went
slowly
on
tired
though
they
were
picture
the
two
tiny
figures
bent
shivering
and
weary
walking
with
clumsy
sticks
cut
in
the
wood
amongst
the
scorn
of
those
tremendous
peaks
which
the
moon
showed
all
too
clearly
they
got
little
warmth
from
walking
they
were
too
weary
to
run
and
after
a
while
they
halted
and
burned
their
sticks
and
got
a
little
warmth
for
some
moments
from
their
fire
which
burned
feebly
and
strangely
in
those
inhuman
solitudes
then
they
went
on
again
and
their
track
grew
steeper
they
rested
again
for
fatigue
and
rose
and
climbed
again
because
of
the
cold
and
all
the
while
the
peaks
stared
over
them
to
spaces
far
beyond
the
thought
of
man
long
before
spain
knew
anything
of
dawn
a
monster
high
in
heaven
smiled
at
the
sun
a
peak
all
its
aged
children
it
greeted
the
sun
as
though
this
lonely
thing
that
scorned
the
race
of
man
since
ever
it
came
had
met
a
mighty
equal
out
in
space
the
vast
peak
glowed
and
the
rest
of
its
grey
race
took
up
the
greeting
leisurely
one
by
one
still
it
was
night
in
all
spanish
houses
rodriguez
and
morano
were
warmed
by
that
cold
peak
glow
though
no
warmth
came
from
it
at
all
but
the
sight
of
it
cheered
them
and
their
pulses
rallied
and
so
they
grew
warmer
in
that
bitter
hour
and
then
dawn
came
and
showed
them
that
they
were
near
the
top
of
the
pass
they
had
come
to
the
snow
that
gleams
there
everlastingly
there
was
no
material
for
a
fire
but
they
ate
cold
meats
and
went
wearily
on
they
passed
through
that
awful
assemblage
of
peaks
by
noon
they
were
walking
upon
level
ground
in
the
afternoon
rodriguez
tired
with
the
journey
and
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
decided
that
it
was
possible
to
sleep
and
wrapping
his
cloak
around
him
he
lay
down
doing
what
morano
would
have
done
by
instinct
morano
was
asleep
at
once
and
rodriguez
soon
after
they
awoke
with
the
cold
at
sunset
refreshed
amazingly
they
ate
some
food
and
started
their
walk
again
to
keep
themselves
warm
for
the
night
they
were
still
on
level
ground
and
set
out
with
a
good
stride
in
their
relief
at
being
done
with
climbing
later
they
slowed
down
and
wandered
just
to
keep
warm
and
some
time
in
the
starlight
they
felt
their
path
dip
and
knew
that
they
were
going
downward
now
to
the
land
of
rodriguez
dreams
when
the
peaks
glowed
again
first
meeting
day
in
her
earliest
of
filmy
air
they
stood
now
behind
the
wanderers
below
them
still
in
darkness
lay
the
land
of
their
dream
but
hitherto
it
had
always
faded
at
dawn
now
hills
put
up
their
heads
one
by
one
through
films
of
mist
woods
showed
then
hedges
and
afterwards
fields
greyly
at
first
and
then
in
the
cold
hard
light
of
morning
becoming
more
and
more
real
the
sight
of
the
land
so
long
sought
at
moments
believed
by
morano
not
to
exist
on
earth
perhaps
to
have
faded
away
when
fables
died
swept
their
fatigue
from
the
wanderers
and
they
stepped
out
helped
by
the
slope
of
the
pyrenees
and
cheered
by
the
rising
sun
they
came
at
last
to
things
that
welcome
man
little
shrubs
flowering
and
at
noon
to
the
edge
of
a
fir
wood
they
entered
the
wood
and
lit
a
merry
fire
and
heard
birds
singing
at
which
they
both
rejoiced
for
the
great
peaks
had
said
nothing
they
ate
the
food
that
morano
cooked
and
drew
warmth
and
cheer
from
the
fire
and
then
they
slept
a
little
and
rising
from
sleep
they
pushed
on
through
the
wood
downward
and
downward
toward
the
land
of
their
dreams
to
see
if
it
was
true
they
passed
the
wood
and
came
to
curious
paths
and
little
hills
and
heath
and
rocky
places
and
wandering
vales
that
twisted
all
awry
they
passed
through
them
all
with
the
slope
of
the
mountain
behind
them
when
level
rays
from
the
sunset
mellowed
the
fields
of
france
the
wanderers
were
walking
still
but
the
peaks
were
far
behind
them
austerely
gazing
on
the
remotest
things
forgetting
the
footsteps
of
man
and
walking
on
past
soft
fields
in
the
evening
all
tilted
a
little
about
the
mountain
feet
they
had
scarcely
welcomed
the
sight
of
the
evening
star
when
they
saw
before
them
the
mild
glow
of
a
window
and
knew
they
were
come
again
to
the
earth
that
is
mother
to
man
in
their
cold
savagery
the
inhuman
mountains
decked
themselves
out
like
gods
with
colours
they
took
from
the
sunset
then
darkened
all
those
peaks
in
brooding
conclave
and
disappeared
in
the
night
and
the
hushed
night
heard
the
tiny
rap
of
morano
hands
on
the
door
of
the
house
that
had
the
glowing
window
the
ninth
chronicle
how
he
won
a
castle
in
spain
the
woman
that
came
to
the
door
had
on
her
face
a
look
that
pleased
morano
are
you
soldiers
she
said
and
her
scared
look
portended
war
my
master
is
a
traveller
looking
for
the
wars
said
morano
are
the
wars
near
oh
no
not
near
said
the
woman
not
near
and
something
in
the
anxious
way
she
said
not
near
pleased
morano
also
we
shall
find
those
wars
master
he
said
and
then
they
both
questioned
her
it
seemed
the
wars
were
but
twenty
miles
away
but
they
will
move
northward
she
said
surely
they
will
move
farther
off
before
the
next
night
was
passed
rodriguez
dream
might
come
true
and
then
the
man
came
to
the
door
anxious
at
hearing
strange
voices
and
morano
questioned
him
too
but
he
understood
never
a
word
he
was
a
french
farmer
that
had
married
a
spanish
girl
out
of
the
wonderful
land
beyond
the
mountains
but
whether
he
understood
her
or
not
he
never
understood
spanish
but
both
rodriguez
and
the
farmer
wife
knew
the
two
languages
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
asking
for
lodging
for
the
night
and
she
looked
wistfully
at
him
going
to
the
wars
for
in
those
days
wars
were
small
and
not
every
man
went
the
night
went
by
with
dreams
that
were
all
on
the
verge
of
waking
which
passed
like
ghosts
along
the
edge
of
night
almost
touched
by
the
light
of
day
it
was
rodriguez
whom
these
dreams
visited
the
farmer
and
his
wife
wondered
awhile
and
then
slept
morano
slept
with
all
his
wonted
lethargy
but
rodriguez
with
his
long
quest
now
on
the
eve
of
fulfilment
slept
a
tumultuous
sleep
sometimes
his
dreams
raced
over
the
pyrenees
running
south
as
far
as
lowlight
and
sometimes
they
rushed
forward
and
clung
like
bats
to
the
towers
of
the
great
castle
that
he
should
win
in
the
war
and
always
he
lay
so
near
the
edge
of
sleep
that
he
never
distinguished
quite
between
thought
and
dream
dawn
came
and
he
put
by
all
the
dreams
but
the
one
that
guided
him
always
and
went
and
woke
morano
they
ate
hurriedly
and
left
the
house
and
again
the
farmer
wife
looked
curiously
at
rodriguez
as
though
there
were
something
strange
in
a
man
that
went
to
wars
for
those
days
were
not
as
these
days
they
followed
the
direction
that
had
been
given
them
and
never
had
the
two
men
walked
so
fast
by
the
end
of
four
hours
they
had
done
sixteen
miles
they
halted
then
and
morano
drew
out
his
with
a
haughty
flourish
and
cooked
in
the
grand
manner
every
movement
he
made
was
a
triumphant
gesture
for
they
had
passed
refugees
war
was
now
obviously
close
they
had
but
to
take
the
way
that
the
refugees
were
not
taking
the
dream
was
true
morano
saw
himself
walking
slowly
in
splendid
dress
along
the
tapestried
corridors
of
his
master
castle
he
would
have
slept
after
eating
and
would
have
dreamed
more
of
this
but
rodriguez
commanded
him
to
put
the
things
together
so
what
remained
of
the
food
disappeared
again
in
a
sack
the
was
slung
over
his
shoulders
and
morano
stood
ready
again
for
the
road
they
passed
more
refugees
their
haste
was
unmistakable
and
told
more
than
their
lips
could
have
told
had
they
tarried
to
speak
the
wars
were
near
now
and
the
wanderers
went
leisurely
as
they
strolled
through
the
twilight
they
came
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
a
little
fold
of
the
earth
disturbed
eras
ago
by
the
awful
rushing
up
of
the
pyrenees
and
they
saw
the
evening
darkening
over
the
fields
below
them
and
a
white
mist
rising
only
just
clear
of
the
grass
and
two
level
rows
of
tents
like
the
mist
with
a
few
more
tents
scattered
near
them
the
tents
had
come
up
that
evening
with
the
mist
for
there
were
men
still
hammering
pegs
they
were
lighting
fires
now
as
evening
settled
in
two
hundred
paces
or
so
separated
each
row
it
was
two
armies
facing
each
other
the
gloaming
faded
mist
and
the
tents
grew
greyer
blinked
out
of
the
dimness
and
grew
redder
and
redder
and
candles
began
to
be
lit
beside
the
tents
till
all
were
glowing
pale
golden
rodriguez
and
morano
stood
there
wondering
awhile
as
they
looked
on
the
beautiful
aura
that
surrounds
the
horrors
of
war
they
came
by
starlight
to
that
tented
field
by
twinkling
starlight
to
the
place
of
rodriguez
dream
for
which
side
will
you
fight
master
said
morano
in
his
ear
for
the
right
said
rodriguez
and
strode
on
towards
the
nearest
tents
never
doubting
that
he
would
be
guided
though
not
trying
to
comprehend
how
this
could
be
they
met
with
an
officer
going
among
his
tents
where
do
you
go
he
shouted
señor
rodriguez
said
i
come
with
my
mandolin
to
sing
songs
to
you
and
at
this
the
officer
called
out
and
others
came
from
their
tents
and
rodriguez
repeated
his
offer
to
them
not
without
confidence
for
he
knew
that
he
had
a
way
with
the
mandolin
and
they
said
that
they
fought
a
battle
on
the
morrow
and
could
not
listen
to
song
they
heaped
scorn
on
singing
for
they
said
they
must
needs
prepare
for
the
fight
and
all
of
them
looked
with
scorn
on
the
mandolin
so
rodriguez
bowed
low
to
them
with
doffed
hat
and
left
them
and
morano
bowed
also
seeing
his
master
bow
and
the
men
of
that
camp
returned
to
their
preparations
a
short
walk
brought
rodriguez
and
his
servant
to
the
other
camp
over
a
flat
field
convenient
for
battle
he
went
up
to
a
large
tent
well
lit
the
door
being
open
towards
him
and
having
explained
his
errand
to
a
sentry
that
stood
outside
he
entered
and
saw
three
persons
of
quality
that
were
sitting
at
a
table
to
them
he
bowed
low
in
the
tent
door
saying
señors
i
am
come
to
sing
songs
to
you
playing
the
while
upon
my
mandolin
and
they
welcomed
him
gladly
saying
we
fight
tomorrow
and
will
gladly
cheer
our
hearts
with
the
sound
of
song
and
strengthen
our
men
thereby
and
so
rodriguez
sang
among
the
tents
standing
by
a
great
fire
to
which
they
led
him
and
men
came
from
the
tents
and
into
the
circle
of
light
and
in
the
darkness
outside
it
were
more
than
rodriguez
saw
and
he
sang
to
the
circle
of
men
and
the
vague
glimmer
of
faces
songs
of
their
homes
he
sang
them
not
in
their
language
but
songs
that
were
made
by
old
poets
about
the
homes
of
their
infancy
in
valleys
under
far
mountains
remote
from
the
pyrenees
and
in
the
song
the
yearnings
of
dead
poets
lived
again
all
streaming
homeward
like
swallows
when
the
last
of
the
storms
is
gone
and
those
yearnings
echoed
in
the
hearts
that
beat
in
the
night
around
the
campfire
and
they
saw
their
own
homes
and
then
he
began
to
touch
his
mandolin
and
he
played
them
the
tunes
that
draw
men
from
their
homes
and
that
march
them
away
to
war
the
tunes
flowed
up
from
the
firelight
the
mandolin
knew
and
the
men
heard
the
mandolin
saying
what
they
would
say
in
the
late
night
he
ended
and
a
hush
came
down
on
the
camp
while
the
music
floated
away
going
up
from
the
dark
ring
of
men
and
the
faces
touching
perhaps
the
knees
of
the
pyrenees
and
drifting
thence
wherever
echoes
go
and
the
sparks
of
the
went
straight
upwards
as
they
had
done
for
hours
and
the
men
that
sat
around
it
saw
them
go
for
long
they
had
not
seen
the
sparks
stream
upwards
for
their
thoughts
were
far
away
with
the
mandolin
and
all
at
once
they
cheered
and
rodriguez
bowed
to
the
one
whose
tent
he
had
entered
and
sought
permission
to
fight
for
them
in
the
morning
with
good
grace
this
was
accorded
him
and
while
he
bowed
and
well
expressed
his
thanks
he
felt
morano
touching
his
elbow
and
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
aside
with
morano
that
fat
man
words
bubbled
over
and
were
said
master
fight
not
for
these
men
he
exclaimed
for
they
listen
to
song
till
midnight
while
the
others
prepare
for
battle
the
others
will
win
the
fight
master
and
where
will
your
castle
be
morano
said
rodriguez
there
seems
to
be
truth
in
that
yet
must
we
fight
for
the
right
for
how
would
it
be
if
those
that
have
denied
song
should
win
and
thrive
the
arm
of
every
good
man
must
be
against
them
they
have
denied
song
morano
we
must
fight
against
them
you
and
i
while
we
can
lay
sword
to
head
yes
indeed
master
said
morano
but
how
shall
you
come
by
your
castle
as
for
that
said
rodriguez
it
must
some
day
be
won
yet
not
by
denying
song
these
have
given
a
welcome
to
song
and
the
others
have
driven
it
forth
and
what
would
life
be
if
those
that
deny
song
are
to
be
permitted
to
thrive
unmolested
by
all
good
men
i
know
not
master
said
morano
but
i
would
have
that
castle
enough
said
rodriguez
we
must
fight
for
the
right
and
so
rodriguez
remained
true
to
those
that
had
heard
him
sing
and
they
gave
him
a
casque
and
proof
they
said
against
any
sword
and
offered
a
sword
that
they
said
would
surely
cleave
any
for
they
fought
not
in
battle
with
the
nimble
rapier
but
rodriguez
did
not
forsake
that
famous
exultant
sword
whose
deeds
he
knew
from
many
an
ancient
song
which
he
had
brought
so
far
to
give
it
its
old
rich
drink
of
blood
he
believed
it
the
bright
key
of
the
castle
he
was
to
win
and
they
gave
rodriguez
a
good
bed
on
the
ground
in
the
tent
of
the
three
leaders
the
tent
to
which
he
first
came
for
they
honoured
him
for
the
gift
of
song
that
he
had
and
because
he
was
a
stranger
and
because
he
had
asked
permission
to
fight
for
them
in
their
battle
and
rodriguez
took
one
look
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
at
the
rose
he
had
carried
from
lowlight
then
slept
a
sleep
through
whose
dreams
loomed
up
the
towers
of
castles
dawn
came
and
he
slept
on
still
but
by
seven
all
the
camp
was
loudly
astir
for
they
had
promised
the
enemy
to
begin
the
battle
at
eight
rodriguez
breakfasted
lightly
for
now
that
the
day
of
his
dreams
was
come
at
last
and
all
his
hopes
depended
on
the
day
an
anxiety
for
many
things
oppressed
him
it
was
as
though
his
castle
rosy
and
fair
in
dreams
chilled
with
its
huge
cold
rocks
all
the
air
near
it
it
was
as
though
rodriguez
touched
it
at
last
with
his
hands
and
felt
a
dankness
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
then
it
came
to
the
hour
of
eight
and
his
anxieties
passed
the
army
was
now
drawn
up
before
its
tents
in
line
but
the
enemy
was
not
yet
ready
and
so
they
had
to
wait
when
the
signal
at
length
was
given
and
the
cannoniers
fired
their
pieces
and
the
musketoons
were
shot
off
many
men
fell
now
rodriguez
with
morano
was
placed
on
the
right
and
either
through
a
slight
difference
in
numbers
or
because
of
an
unevenness
in
the
array
of
battle
they
a
little
overlapped
the
enemy
left
when
a
few
men
fell
wounded
there
by
the
discharge
of
the
musketoons
this
overlapping
was
even
more
pronounced
now
the
leaders
of
that
fair
army
scorned
all
unknightly
devices
and
would
never
have
descended
to
any
vile
ruse
de
guerre
the
reproach
can
therefore
never
be
made
against
them
that
they
ever
intended
to
outflank
their
enemy
yet
when
both
armies
advanced
after
the
discharge
of
the
musketoons
and
the
merry
noise
of
the
cannon
this
occurred
as
the
result
of
chance
which
no
leader
can
be
held
accountable
for
so
that
those
that
speak
of
treachery
in
this
battle
and
deliberate
outflanking
lie
now
rodriguez
as
he
advanced
with
his
sword
when
the
musketoons
were
empty
had
already
chosen
his
adversary
for
he
had
carefully
watched
those
opposite
to
him
before
any
smoke
should
obscure
them
and
had
selected
the
one
who
from
the
splendour
of
his
dress
might
be
expected
to
possess
the
finest
castle
certainly
this
adversary
outshone
those
amongst
whom
he
stood
and
gave
fair
promise
of
owning
goodly
possessions
for
he
wore
a
fine
green
cloak
over
a
dress
of
lilac
and
his
helm
and
cuirass
had
a
look
of
crafty
workmanship
towards
him
rodriguez
marched
then
began
fighting
foot
to
foot
and
there
was
a
pretty
laying
on
of
swords
and
had
there
been
a
poet
there
that
day
then
the
story
of
their
fight
had
come
down
to
you
my
reader
all
that
way
from
the
pyrenees
down
all
those
hundreds
of
years
and
this
tale
of
mine
had
been
useless
the
lame
repetition
in
prose
of
songs
that
your
nurses
had
sung
to
you
but
they
fought
unseen
by
those
that
see
for
the
muses
rodriguez
advanced
upon
his
chosen
adversary
and
having
briefly
bowed
they
engaged
at
once
and
rodriguez
belaboured
his
helm
till
dints
appeared
and
beat
it
with
swift
strokes
yet
till
the
dints
were
cracks
and
beat
the
cracks
till
hair
began
to
appear
and
all
the
while
his
adversary
strokes
grew
weaker
and
wilder
until
he
tottered
to
earth
and
rodriguez
had
won
swift
then
as
cats
while
morano
kept
off
others
rodriguez
leaped
to
his
throat
and
holding
up
the
stiletto
that
he
had
long
ago
taken
as
his
legacy
from
the
host
of
the
dragon
and
knight
he
demanded
the
fallen
man
castle
as
ransom
for
his
life
my
castle
señor
said
his
prisoner
weakly
yes
said
rodriguez
impatiently
yes
señor
said
his
adversary
and
closed
his
eyes
for
awhile
does
he
surrender
his
castle
master
asked
morano
yes
indeed
said
rodriguez
they
looked
at
each
other
all
at
last
was
well
the
battle
was
rolling
away
from
them
and
was
now
well
within
the
enemy
tents
history
says
of
that
day
that
the
good
men
won
and
sitting
a
muse
upon
her
mythical
mountain
her
decision
must
needs
be
one
from
which
we
may
not
appeal
and
yet
i
wonder
if
she
is
ever
bribed
certainly
the
shrewd
sense
of
morano
erred
for
once
for
those
for
whom
he
had
predicted
victory
because
they
prepared
so
ostentatiously
upon
the
field
were
defeated
while
the
others
having
made
their
preparations
long
before
were
able
to
cheer
themselves
with
song
before
the
battle
and
to
win
it
when
it
came
and
so
rodriguez
was
left
undisturbed
in
possession
of
his
prisoner
and
with
the
promise
of
his
castle
as
a
ransom
the
battle
was
swiftly
over
as
must
needs
be
where
little
armies
meet
so
close
the
camp
was
occupied
his
army
routed
and
within
an
hour
of
beginning
the
battle
the
last
of
the
fighting
ceased
the
army
returned
to
its
tents
to
rejoice
and
to
make
a
banquet
bringing
with
them
captives
and
horses
and
other
spoils
of
war
and
rodriguez
had
honour
among
them
because
he
had
fought
on
the
right
and
so
was
one
of
those
that
had
broken
the
enemy
left
from
which
direction
victory
had
come
and
they
would
have
feasted
him
and
done
him
honour
both
for
his
work
with
the
sword
and
for
his
songs
to
the
mandolin
and
they
would
have
marched
away
soon
to
their
own
country
and
would
have
taken
him
with
them
and
advanced
him
to
honour
there
but
rodriguez
would
not
stay
with
them
for
he
had
his
castle
at
last
and
must
needs
march
off
at
once
with
his
captive
and
morano
to
see
the
fulfilment
of
his
dream
and
therefore
he
thanked
the
leaders
of
that
host
with
many
a
courtesy
and
many
a
bow
and
explained
to
them
how
it
was
about
his
castle
and
felicitated
them
on
the
victory
of
their
good
cause
and
so
wished
them
farewell
and
they
said
farewell
sorrowfully
but
when
they
saw
he
would
go
they
gave
him
horses
for
himself
and
morano
and
another
for
his
captive
and
they
heaped
them
with
sacks
of
provender
and
blankets
and
all
things
that
could
give
him
comfort
upon
a
journey
all
this
they
brought
him
out
of
their
spoils
of
war
and
they
would
give
him
no
less
that
the
most
that
the
horses
could
carry
and
then
rodriguez
turned
to
his
captive
again
who
now
stood
on
his
feet
señor
he
said
pray
tell
us
all
of
your
castle
wherewith
you
ransom
your
life
señor
he
answered
i
have
a
castle
in
spain
master
broke
in
morano
his
eyes
lighting
up
with
delight
there
are
no
castles
like
the
spanish
ones
they
got
to
horse
then
all
three
the
captive
on
a
horse
of
far
poorer
build
than
the
other
two
and
with
sacks
for
rodriguez
took
no
chance
of
his
castle
cantering
as
it
were
away
from
him
on
four
hooves
through
the
dust
and
when
they
heard
that
his
journey
was
by
way
of
the
pyrenees
four
knights
of
that
army
swore
they
would
ride
with
him
as
far
as
the
frontier
of
spain
to
bear
him
company
and
bring
him
fuel
in
the
lonely
cold
of
the
mountains
they
all
set
off
and
the
merry
army
cheered
he
left
them
making
ready
for
their
banquet
and
never
knew
the
cause
for
which
he
had
fought
they
came
by
evening
again
to
the
house
to
which
rodriguez
had
come
two
nights
before
when
he
had
slept
there
with
his
castle
yet
to
win
they
all
halted
before
it
and
the
man
and
the
woman
came
to
the
door
terrified
the
wars
they
said
the
wars
said
one
of
the
riders
are
over
and
the
just
cause
has
won
the
saints
be
praised
said
the
woman
but
will
there
be
no
more
fighting
never
again
said
the
horseman
for
men
are
sick
of
gunpowder
the
saints
be
thanked
she
said
say
not
that
said
the
horseman
for
satan
invented
gunpowder
and
she
was
silent
but
had
none
been
there
she
had
secretly
thanked
satan
they
demanded
the
food
and
shelter
that
armed
men
have
the
right
to
demand
in
the
morning
they
were
gone
they
became
a
memory
which
lingered
like
a
vision
made
partly
of
sunset
and
partly
of
the
splendour
of
their
cloaks
and
so
went
down
the
years
that
those
two
folk
had
a
thing
of
romance
magnificence
and
fear
and
now
the
slope
of
the
mountain
began
to
lift
against
them
and
they
rode
slowly
towards
those
unearthly
peaks
that
had
deserted
the
level
fields
before
ever
man
came
to
them
and
that
sat
there
now
familiar
with
stars
and
dawn
with
the
air
of
never
having
known
of
man
and
as
they
rode
they
talked
and
rodriguez
talked
with
the
four
knights
that
rode
with
him
and
they
told
tales
of
war
and
told
of
the
ways
of
fighting
of
many
men
and
morano
rode
behind
them
beside
the
captive
and
questioned
him
all
the
morning
about
his
castle
in
spain
and
at
first
the
captive
answered
his
questions
slowly
as
if
he
were
weary
or
as
though
he
were
long
from
home
and
remembered
its
features
dimly
but
memory
soon
returned
and
he
answered
clearly
telling
of
such
a
castle
as
morano
had
not
dreamed
and
the
eyes
of
the
fat
man
bulged
as
he
rode
beside
him
growing
rounder
and
rounder
as
they
rode
they
came
by
sunset
to
that
wood
of
firs
in
which
rodriguez
had
rested
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
they
halted
and
tethered
their
horses
to
trees
they
tied
blankets
to
branches
and
made
an
encampment
and
in
the
midst
of
it
they
made
a
fire
at
first
with
and
the
dead
lower
twigs
and
then
with
great
logs
and
there
they
feasted
together
all
seven
around
the
fire
and
when
the
feast
was
over
and
the
great
logs
burning
well
and
red
sparks
went
up
slowly
towards
the
silver
stars
morano
turned
to
the
prisoner
seated
beside
him
and
tell
the
señors
he
said
of
my
master
castle
and
in
the
silence
that
was
rather
lulled
than
broken
by
the
whispering
wind
from
the
snow
that
sighed
through
the
wood
the
captive
slowly
lifted
up
his
head
and
spoke
in
his
queer
accent
señors
in
aragon
across
the
ebro
are
many
goodly
towers
and
as
he
spoke
they
all
leaned
forward
to
listen
dark
faces
bright
with
firelight
on
the
ebro
southern
bank
stands
he
went
on
my
home
he
told
of
strange
rocks
rising
from
the
ebro
of
buttresses
built
among
them
in
unremembered
times
of
the
great
towers
lifting
up
in
multitudes
from
the
buttresses
and
of
the
mighty
wall
windowless
until
it
came
to
incredible
heights
where
the
windows
shone
all
safe
from
any
ladder
of
war
at
first
they
felt
in
his
story
his
pride
in
his
lost
home
and
wondered
when
he
told
of
the
height
of
his
towers
how
much
he
added
in
pride
and
then
the
force
of
that
story
gripped
them
all
and
they
doubted
never
a
battlement
but
each
man
fancy
saw
between
firelight
and
starlight
every
tower
clear
in
the
air
and
at
great
height
upon
those
marvellous
towers
the
turrets
of
arches
were
queer
carvings
grinned
down
from
above
inaccessible
windows
and
the
towers
gathered
in
light
from
the
lonely
air
where
nothing
stood
but
they
and
flashed
it
far
over
aragon
and
the
ebro
floated
by
them
always
new
always
amazed
by
their
beauty
he
spoke
to
the
six
listeners
on
the
lonely
mountain
slowly
remembering
mournfully
and
never
a
story
that
romance
has
known
and
told
of
castles
in
spain
has
held
men
more
than
he
held
his
listeners
while
the
sparks
flew
up
toward
the
peaks
of
the
pyrenees
and
did
not
reach
to
them
but
failed
in
the
night
giving
place
to
the
white
stars
and
when
he
faltered
through
sorrow
or
memory
weakening
morano
always
watching
with
glittering
eyes
would
touch
his
arm
sitting
beside
him
and
ask
some
question
and
the
captive
would
answer
the
question
and
so
talk
sadly
on
he
told
of
the
upper
terraces
where
heliotrope
and
aloe
and
oleander
took
sunlight
far
above
their
native
earth
and
though
but
rare
winds
carried
the
butterflies
there
such
as
came
to
those
fragrant
terraces
lingered
for
ever
and
after
a
while
he
spoke
on
carelessly
and
morano
questions
ended
and
none
of
the
men
in
the
firelight
said
a
word
but
he
spoke
on
uninterrupted
holding
them
as
by
a
spell
with
his
eyes
fixed
far
away
on
black
crags
of
the
pyrenees
telling
of
his
great
towers
almost
it
might
have
seemed
he
was
speaking
of
mountains
and
when
the
fire
was
only
a
deep
red
glow
and
white
ash
showed
all
round
it
and
he
ceased
speaking
having
told
of
a
castle
marvellous
even
amongst
the
towers
of
spain
all
sitting
round
the
embers
felt
sad
with
his
sadness
for
his
sad
voice
drifted
into
their
very
spirits
as
white
mists
enter
houses
and
all
were
glad
when
rodriguez
said
to
him
that
one
of
his
ten
tall
towers
the
captive
should
keep
and
should
live
in
it
for
ever
and
the
sad
man
thanked
him
sadly
and
showed
no
joy
when
the
tale
of
the
castle
and
those
great
towers
was
done
the
wind
that
blew
from
the
snow
touched
all
the
hearers
they
had
seemed
to
be
away
by
the
bank
of
the
ebro
in
the
heat
and
light
of
spain
and
now
the
vast
night
stripped
them
and
the
peaks
seemed
to
close
round
on
them
they
wrapped
themselves
in
blankets
and
lay
down
in
their
shelters
for
a
while
they
heard
the
wind
waving
branches
and
the
thump
of
a
horse
hoof
restless
at
night
then
they
all
slept
except
one
that
guarded
the
captive
and
the
captive
himself
who
long
lay
thinking
and
thinking
dawn
stole
through
the
wood
and
waked
none
of
the
sleepers
the
birds
all
shouted
at
them
still
they
slept
on
and
then
the
captive
guard
wakened
morano
and
he
stirred
up
the
sparks
of
the
fire
and
cooked
and
they
breakfasted
late
and
soon
they
left
the
wood
and
faced
the
bleak
slope
all
of
them
going
on
foot
and
leading
their
horses
and
the
track
crawled
on
till
it
came
to
the
scorn
of
the
peaks
winding
over
a
shoulder
of
the
pyrenees
where
the
peaks
gaze
cold
and
contemptuous
away
from
the
things
of
man
in
the
presence
of
those
that
bore
them
company
rodriguez
and
morano
felt
none
of
the
deadly
majesty
of
those
peaks
that
regard
so
awfully
over
the
solitudes
they
passed
through
them
telling
cheerfully
of
wars
the
four
knights
had
known
and
descended
and
came
by
sunset
to
the
lower
edge
of
the
snow
they
pushed
on
a
little
farther
and
then
camped
and
with
branches
from
the
last
camp
that
they
had
heaped
on
their
horses
they
made
another
great
fire
and
huddling
round
it
in
the
blankets
that
they
had
brought
found
warmth
even
there
so
far
from
the
hearths
of
men
and
dawn
and
the
cold
woke
them
all
on
that
treeless
slope
by
barely
warm
embers
morano
cooked
again
and
they
ate
in
silence
and
then
the
four
knights
rose
sadly
and
one
bowed
and
told
rodriguez
how
they
must
now
go
back
to
their
own
country
and
grief
seized
on
rodriguez
at
his
words
seeing
that
he
was
to
lose
four
old
friends
at
once
and
perhaps
for
ever
for
when
men
have
fought
under
the
same
banner
in
war
they
become
old
friends
on
that
morning
señors
said
rodriguez
we
may
never
meet
again
and
the
other
looked
back
to
the
peaks
beyond
which
the
far
lands
lay
and
made
a
gesture
with
his
hands
señor
at
least
said
rodriguez
let
us
camp
once
more
together
and
even
morano
babbled
a
supplication
methinks
señor
he
answered
we
are
already
across
the
frontier
and
when
we
men
of
the
sword
cross
frontiers
misunderstandings
arise
so
that
it
is
our
custom
never
to
pass
across
them
save
when
we
push
the
frontier
with
us
adding
the
lands
over
which
we
march
to
those
of
our
liege
lord
señors
said
rodriguez
the
whole
mountain
is
the
frontier
come
with
us
one
day
further
but
they
would
not
stay
all
the
good
things
that
could
be
carried
they
loaded
on
to
the
three
horses
whose
heads
were
turned
towards
spain
then
turned
all
four
and
said
farewell
to
the
three
and
long
looked
each
in
the
face
of
rodriguez
as
he
took
his
hand
in
fare
well
for
they
had
fought
under
the
same
banner
and
as
wayfaring
was
in
those
days
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
ever
meet
again
they
turned
and
went
with
their
horses
back
towards
the
land
they
had
fought
for
rodriguez
and
his
captive
and
morano
went
sadly
down
the
mountain
they
came
to
the
fir
woods
and
rested
and
morano
cooked
their
dinner
and
after
a
while
they
were
able
to
ride
their
horses
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
rode
on
past
the
inn
of
the
world
end
they
camped
in
the
open
and
all
night
long
rodriguez
or
morano
guarded
the
captive
for
two
days
and
part
of
the
third
they
followed
their
old
course
catching
sight
again
and
again
of
the
river
segre
and
then
they
turned
further
west
ward
to
come
to
aragon
further
up
the
ebro
all
the
way
they
avoided
houses
and
camped
in
the
open
for
they
kept
their
captive
to
themselves
and
they
slept
warm
with
their
ample
store
of
blankets
and
all
the
while
the
captive
seemed
morose
or
ill
at
ease
speaking
seldom
and
when
he
did
in
nervous
jerks
morano
as
they
rode
or
by
the
camp
fire
at
evening
still
questioned
him
now
and
then
about
his
castle
and
sometimes
he
almost
seemed
to
contradict
himself
but
in
so
vast
a
castle
may
have
been
many
styles
of
architecture
and
it
was
difficult
to
trace
a
contradiction
among
all
those
towers
and
turrets
his
name
was
don
one
night
while
all
three
sat
and
gazed
at
the
as
men
will
when
the
chilly
stars
are
still
and
the
merry
flames
are
leaping
rodriguez
seeking
to
cheer
his
captive
mood
told
him
some
of
his
strange
adventures
the
captive
listened
with
his
sombre
air
but
when
rodriguez
told
how
they
woke
on
the
mountain
after
their
journey
to
the
sun
and
the
sun
was
shining
on
their
faces
in
the
open
but
the
magician
and
his
whole
house
were
gone
then
there
came
another
look
into
alvidar
eyes
and
rodriguez
ended
his
tale
and
silence
fell
broken
only
by
morano
saying
across
the
fire
it
is
true
and
the
captive
thoughtful
eyes
gazed
into
the
darkness
and
then
he
also
spoke
señor
he
said
near
to
my
castle
which
looks
into
the
ebro
dwells
a
magician
also
is
it
so
said
rodriguez
indeed
so
señor
said
don
alvidar
he
is
my
enemy
but
dwells
in
awe
of
me
and
so
durst
never
molest
me
except
by
minor
wonders
how
know
you
that
he
is
a
magician
said
rodriguez
by
those
wonders
answered
his
captive
he
afflicts
small
dogs
and
my
poultry
and
he
wears
a
thin
high
hat
his
beard
is
also
extraordinary
long
said
morano
green
answered
don
alvidar
is
he
very
near
the
castle
said
rodriguez
and
morano
together
too
near
said
don
alvidar
is
his
house
wonderful
rodriguez
asked
it
is
a
common
house
was
the
answer
a
mean
long
house
of
one
story
the
walls
are
white
and
it
is
well
thatched
the
windows
are
painted
green
there
are
two
doors
in
it
and
by
one
of
them
grows
a
rose
tree
a
rose
tree
exclaimed
rodriguez
it
seemed
a
rose
tree
said
don
alvidar
a
captive
lady
chained
to
the
wall
perhaps
changed
by
magic
suggested
morano
perhaps
said
don
alvidar
a
strange
house
for
a
magician
said
rodriguez
for
it
sounded
like
any
small
farmhouse
in
spain
he
much
affects
mortal
ways
replied
don
alvidar
little
more
was
then
said
the
fire
being
low
and
rodriguez
lay
down
to
sleep
while
morano
guarded
the
captive
and
the
day
after
that
they
came
to
aragon
and
in
one
day
more
they
were
across
the
ebro
and
then
they
rode
west
for
a
day
along
its
southern
bank
looking
all
the
while
as
they
rode
for
rodriguez
castle
and
more
and
more
silent
and
aloof
as
they
rode
grew
don
and
just
before
sunset
a
cry
broke
from
the
captive
he
has
taken
it
he
said
and
he
pointed
to
just
such
a
house
as
he
had
described
a
jolly
spanish
farmhouse
with
white
walls
and
thatch
and
green
shutters
and
a
rose
tree
by
one
of
the
doors
just
as
he
had
told
the
magician
house
but
the
castle
is
gone
he
said
rodriguez
looked
at
his
face
and
saw
real
alarm
in
it
he
said
nothing
but
rode
on
in
haste
a
dim
hope
in
his
mind
that
explanations
at
the
white
cottage
might
do
something
for
his
lost
castle
and
when
the
hooves
were
heard
a
woman
came
out
of
the
cottage
door
by
the
rose
tree
leading
a
small
child
by
the
hand
and
the
captive
called
to
the
woman
maria
we
are
lost
and
i
gave
my
great
castle
with
towers
that
stood
just
here
as
ransom
to
this
señor
for
my
life
but
now
alas
i
see
that
that
magician
who
dwelt
in
the
house
where
you
are
now
has
taken
it
whither
we
know
not
yes
pedro
said
the
woman
he
took
it
yesterday
and
she
turned
blue
eyes
upon
rodriguez
and
then
morano
would
be
silent
no
longer
he
had
thought
vaguely
for
some
days
and
intensely
for
the
last
few
hundreds
yards
and
now
he
blurted
out
the
thoughts
that
boiled
in
him
master
he
shouted
he
has
sold
his
cattle
and
bought
this
raiment
of
his
and
that
helmet
that
you
opened
up
for
him
and
never
had
any
castle
on
the
ebro
with
any
towers
to
it
and
never
knew
any
magician
but
lived
in
this
house
himself
and
now
your
castle
is
gone
master
and
as
for
his
life
be
silent
a
moment
morano
said
rodriguez
and
he
turned
to
the
woman
whose
eyes
were
on
him
still
was
there
a
castle
in
this
place
he
said
yes
señor
i
swear
it
she
said
and
my
husband
though
a
poor
man
always
spoke
the
truth
she
lies
said
morano
and
rodriguez
silenced
him
with
a
gesture
i
will
get
neighbours
who
will
swear
it
too
she
said
a
lousy
neighbourhood
said
morano
again
rodriguez
silenced
him
and
then
the
child
spoke
in
a
frightened
voice
holding
up
a
small
cross
that
it
had
been
taught
to
revere
i
swear
it
too
it
said
rodriguez
heaved
a
sigh
and
turned
away
master
morano
cried
in
pained
astonishment
you
will
not
believe
their
swearings
the
child
swore
by
the
cross
he
answered
but
master
morano
exclaimed
but
rodriguez
would
say
no
more
and
they
rode
away
aimless
in
silence
galloping
hooves
were
heard
and
pedro
was
there
he
had
come
to
give
up
his
horse
he
gave
its
reins
to
the
scowling
morano
but
rodriguez
said
never
a
word
then
he
ran
round
and
kissed
rodriguez
hand
who
still
was
silent
for
his
hopes
were
lost
with
the
castle
but
he
nodded
his
head
and
so
parted
for
ever
from
the
man
whom
his
wife
called
pedro
who
called
himself
don
the
tenth
chronicle
how
he
came
back
to
lowlight
master
morano
said
but
rodriguez
rode
ahead
and
would
not
speak
they
were
riding
vaguely
southward
they
had
ample
provisions
on
the
horse
that
morano
led
as
well
as
blankets
which
gave
them
comfort
at
night
that
night
they
both
got
the
sleep
they
needed
now
that
there
was
no
captive
to
guard
all
the
next
day
they
rode
slowly
in
the
april
weather
by
roads
that
wandered
among
tended
fields
but
a
little
way
off
from
the
fields
there
shone
low
hills
in
the
sunlight
so
wild
so
free
of
man
that
rodriguez
remembering
them
in
later
years
wondered
if
their
wild
shrubs
just
hid
the
frontiers
of
fairyland
for
two
days
they
rode
by
the
edge
of
unguessable
regions
had
pan
piped
there
no
one
had
marvelled
nor
though
fauns
had
scurried
past
sheltering
clumps
of
azaleas
in
the
twilight
no
tiny
queens
had
court
within
rings
of
toadstools
yet
almost
almost
they
appeared
and
on
the
third
day
all
at
once
they
came
to
a
road
they
knew
it
was
the
road
by
which
they
had
ridden
when
rodriguez
still
had
his
dream
the
way
from
shadow
valley
to
the
ebro
and
so
they
turned
into
the
road
they
knew
as
wanderers
always
will
and
still
without
aim
or
plan
they
faced
towards
shadow
valley
and
in
the
evening
of
the
day
that
followed
that
as
they
looked
about
for
a
there
came
in
sight
the
village
on
the
hill
which
rodriguez
knew
to
be
fifty
miles
from
the
forest
it
was
the
village
in
which
they
had
rested
the
first
night
after
leaving
shadow
valley
they
did
not
camp
but
went
on
to
the
village
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
inn
habit
guides
us
all
at
times
even
kings
are
the
slaves
of
it
though
in
their
presence
it
takes
the
prouder
name
of
precedent
and
here
were
two
wanderers
without
any
plans
at
all
they
were
therefore
defenceless
in
the
grip
of
habit
and
seeing
an
inn
they
knew
they
loitered
up
to
it
mine
host
came
again
to
the
door
he
cheerfully
asked
rodriguez
how
he
had
fared
on
his
journey
but
rodriguez
would
say
nothing
he
asked
for
lodging
for
himself
and
morano
and
stabling
for
the
horses
he
ate
and
slept
and
paid
his
due
and
in
the
morning
was
gone
whatever
impulses
guided
rodriguez
as
he
rode
and
morano
followed
he
knew
not
what
they
were
or
even
that
there
could
be
any
he
followed
the
road
without
hope
and
only
travelled
to
change
his
and
that
night
he
was
between
the
village
and
shadow
valley
morano
never
spoke
for
he
saw
that
his
master
disappointment
was
still
raw
but
it
pleased
him
to
notice
as
he
had
done
all
day
that
they
were
heading
for
the
great
forest
he
cooked
their
evening
meal
in
their
camp
by
the
wayside
and
they
both
ate
it
in
silence
for
awhile
rodriguez
sat
and
gazed
at
the
in
the
and
when
these
began
to
be
hidden
by
white
ash
he
went
to
his
blankets
and
slept
and
morano
went
quietly
about
the
little
camp
doing
all
that
needed
to
be
done
with
never
a
word
when
the
horses
were
seen
to
and
fed
when
the
knives
were
cleaned
when
everything
was
ready
for
the
start
next
morning
morano
went
to
his
blankets
and
slept
too
and
in
the
morning
again
they
wandered
on
that
evening
they
saw
the
low
gold
rays
of
the
sun
enchanting
the
tops
of
a
forest
it
almost
surprised
rodriguez
travelling
without
an
aim
to
recognise
shadow
valley
they
quickened
their
slow
pace
and
before
twilight
faded
they
were
under
the
great
oaks
but
the
last
of
the
twilight
could
not
pierce
the
dimness
of
shadow
valley
and
it
seemed
as
if
night
had
entered
the
forest
with
them
they
chose
a
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
darkness
and
morano
tied
the
horses
to
trees
a
little
way
off
from
the
camp
then
he
returned
to
rodriguez
and
tied
a
blanket
to
the
windward
side
of
two
trees
to
make
a
kind
of
bedroom
for
his
master
for
they
had
all
the
blankets
they
needed
and
when
this
was
done
he
set
the
emblem
and
banner
of
camps
anywhere
all
over
the
world
in
any
time
for
he
gathered
sticks
and
branches
and
lit
a
the
first
red
flames
went
up
and
waved
and
proclaimed
a
camp
the
light
made
a
little
circle
shadows
ran
away
to
the
forest
and
the
circle
of
light
on
the
ground
and
on
the
trees
that
stood
round
it
became
for
that
one
night
home
they
heard
the
horses
stamp
as
they
always
did
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
and
then
morano
went
to
give
them
their
fodder
rodriguez
sat
and
gazed
into
the
fire
his
mind
as
full
of
thoughts
as
the
fire
was
full
of
pictures
one
by
one
the
pictures
in
the
fire
fell
in
and
all
his
thoughts
led
nowhere
he
heard
morano
running
back
the
thirty
or
forty
yards
he
had
gone
from
the
master
morano
said
the
three
horses
are
gone
gone
said
rodriguez
there
was
little
more
to
say
it
was
too
dark
to
track
them
and
he
knew
that
to
find
three
horses
in
shadow
valley
was
a
task
that
might
take
years
and
after
more
thought
than
might
seem
to
have
been
needed
he
said
we
must
go
on
foot
have
we
far
to
go
master
said
morano
for
the
first
time
daring
to
question
him
since
they
left
the
cottage
in
spain
i
have
nowhere
to
go
said
rodriguez
his
head
was
downcast
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
morano
stood
and
looked
at
him
unhappily
full
of
a
sympathy
that
he
found
no
words
to
express
a
light
wind
slipped
through
the
branches
and
everything
else
was
still
it
was
some
while
before
he
lifted
his
head
and
then
he
saw
before
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
standing
with
folded
arms
the
man
in
the
brown
leather
jacket
nowhere
to
go
said
he
who
needs
go
anywhere
from
shadow
valley
rodriguez
stared
at
him
but
i
ca
stay
here
he
said
there
is
no
fairer
forest
known
to
man
said
the
other
i
know
many
songs
that
prove
it
rodriguez
made
no
answer
but
dropped
his
eyes
gazing
with
listless
glance
once
more
at
the
ground
come
señor
said
the
man
in
the
leather
jacket
none
are
unhappy
in
shadow
valley
who
are
you
said
rodriguez
both
he
and
morano
were
gazing
curiously
at
the
man
whom
they
had
saved
three
weeks
ago
from
the
noose
your
friend
answered
the
stranger
no
friend
can
help
me
said
rodriguez
señor
said
the
stranger
across
the
fire
still
standing
with
folded
arms
i
remain
under
an
obligation
to
no
man
if
you
have
an
enemy
or
love
a
lady
and
if
they
dwell
within
a
hundred
miles
either
shall
be
before
you
within
a
week
rodriguez
shook
his
head
and
silence
fell
by
the
and
after
awhile
rodriguez
who
was
accustomed
to
dismiss
a
subject
when
it
was
ended
saw
the
stranger
eyes
on
him
yet
still
waiting
for
him
to
say
more
and
those
clear
blue
eyes
seemed
to
do
more
than
wait
seemed
almost
to
command
till
they
overcame
rodriguez
will
and
he
obeyed
and
said
although
he
could
feel
each
word
struggling
to
stay
unuttered
señor
i
went
to
the
wars
to
win
a
castle
and
a
piece
of
land
thereby
and
might
perchance
have
wed
and
ended
my
wanderings
with
those
of
my
servant
here
but
the
wars
are
over
and
no
castle
is
won
and
the
stranger
saw
by
his
face
in
the
firelight
and
knew
from
the
tones
of
his
voice
in
the
still
night
the
trouble
that
his
words
had
not
expressed
i
remain
under
an
obligation
to
no
man
said
the
stranger
be
at
this
place
in
four
weeks
time
and
you
shall
have
a
castle
as
large
as
any
that
men
win
by
war
and
a
goodly
park
thereby
your
castle
master
said
morano
delighted
whose
only
thought
up
to
then
was
as
to
who
had
got
his
horses
but
rodriguez
only
stared
and
the
stranger
said
no
more
but
turned
on
his
heel
and
then
rodriguez
awoke
out
of
his
silence
and
wonder
but
where
he
said
what
castle
that
you
will
see
said
the
stranger
but
but
how
said
rodriguez
what
he
meant
was
how
can
i
believe
you
but
he
did
not
put
it
in
words
my
word
was
never
broken
said
the
other
and
that
is
a
good
boast
to
make
for
those
of
us
who
can
make
it
if
we
need
boast
at
all
whose
word
said
rodriguez
looking
him
in
the
eyes
the
smoke
from
the
fire
between
them
was
thickening
greyly
as
though
something
had
been
cast
on
it
the
word
he
said
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
rodriguez
gazing
through
the
increasing
smoke
saw
not
to
the
other
side
he
rose
and
walked
round
the
fire
but
the
strange
man
was
gone
rodriguez
came
back
to
his
place
by
the
fire
and
sat
long
there
in
silence
morano
was
bubbling
over
to
speak
but
respected
his
silence
for
rodriguez
was
gazing
into
the
deeps
of
the
fire
seeing
pictures
there
that
were
brighter
than
any
that
he
had
known
they
were
so
clear
now
that
they
seemed
almost
true
he
saw
serafina
face
there
looking
full
at
him
he
watched
it
long
until
other
pictures
hid
it
visions
that
had
no
meaning
for
rodriguez
and
not
till
then
he
spoke
and
when
he
spoke
his
face
was
almost
smiling
well
morano
he
said
have
we
come
by
that
castle
at
last
that
man
does
not
lie
master
he
answered
and
his
eyes
were
glittering
with
shrewd
conviction
what
shall
we
do
then
said
rodriguez
let
us
go
to
some
village
master
said
morano
until
the
time
he
said
what
village
rodriguez
asked
i
know
not
master
answered
morano
his
face
a
puzzle
of
innocence
and
wonder
and
rodriguez
fell
back
into
thought
again
and
the
dancing
flames
calmed
down
to
a
deep
quiet
glow
and
soon
rodriguez
stepped
back
a
yard
or
two
from
the
fire
to
where
morano
had
prepared
his
bed
and
watching
the
fire
still
and
turning
over
thoughts
that
flashed
and
changed
as
fast
as
the
embers
he
went
to
wonderful
dreams
that
were
no
more
strange
or
elusive
than
that
valley
wonderful
king
when
he
spoke
in
the
morning
the
was
newly
lit
and
there
was
a
smell
of
bacon
and
morano
out
of
breath
and
puzzled
was
calling
to
him
master
he
said
i
was
mistaken
about
those
horses
mistaken
said
rodriguez
they
were
just
as
i
left
them
master
all
tied
to
the
tree
with
my
knots
rodriguez
left
it
at
that
morano
could
make
mistakes
and
the
forest
was
full
of
wonders
anything
might
happen
we
will
ride
he
said
morano
breakfast
was
as
good
as
ever
and
when
he
had
packed
up
those
few
belongings
that
make
a
of
any
chance
spot
in
the
wilderness
they
mounted
the
horses
which
were
surely
there
and
rode
away
through
sunlight
and
green
leaves
they
rode
slow
for
the
branches
were
low
over
the
path
and
whoever
canters
in
a
forest
and
closes
his
eyes
against
a
branch
has
to
consider
whether
he
will
open
them
to
be
whipped
by
the
next
branch
or
close
them
till
he
bumps
his
head
into
a
tree
and
it
suited
rodriguez
to
loiter
for
he
thought
thus
to
meet
the
king
of
shadow
valley
again
or
his
green
bowmen
and
learn
the
answers
to
innumerable
questions
about
his
castle
which
were
wandering
through
his
mind
they
ate
and
slept
at
noon
in
the
forest
glittering
greenness
they
passed
afterwards
by
the
old
house
in
the
wood
in
which
the
bowmen
feasted
for
they
followed
the
track
that
they
had
taken
before
they
knocked
loud
on
the
door
as
they
passed
but
the
house
was
empty
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
multitude
felling
trees
but
whenever
they
approached
the
sound
of
chopping
ceased
again
and
again
they
left
the
track
and
rode
towards
the
sound
of
chopping
and
every
time
the
chopping
died
away
just
as
they
drew
close
they
saw
many
a
tree
half
felled
but
never
a
green
bowman
and
at
last
they
left
it
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
forest
and
returned
to
the
track
lest
they
lose
it
for
the
track
was
more
important
to
them
than
curiosity
and
evening
had
come
and
was
filling
the
forest
with
dimness
and
shadows
stealing
across
the
track
were
beginning
to
hide
it
away
in
the
distance
they
heard
the
invisible
woodmen
chopping
and
then
they
camped
again
and
lit
their
fire
and
night
came
down
and
the
two
wanderers
slept
the
nightingale
sang
until
he
woke
the
cuckoo
and
the
cuckoo
filled
the
leafy
air
so
full
of
his
two
limpid
notes
that
the
dreams
of
rodriguez
heard
them
and
went
away
back
over
their
border
to
dreamland
rodriguez
awoke
morano
who
lit
his
fire
and
soon
they
had
struck
their
camp
and
were
riding
on
by
noon
they
saw
that
if
they
hurried
on
they
could
come
to
lowlight
by
nightfall
but
this
was
not
rodriguez
plan
for
he
had
planned
to
ride
into
lowlight
as
he
had
done
once
before
at
the
hour
when
serafina
sat
in
her
balcony
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
as
spanish
ladies
in
those
days
sometimes
did
so
they
tarried
long
by
their
at
noon
and
then
rode
slowly
on
and
when
they
camped
that
night
they
were
still
in
the
forest
morano
said
rodriguez
over
the
tomorrow
brings
me
to
lowlight
aye
master
said
morano
we
shall
be
there
tomorrow
that
señor
with
whom
i
had
a
meeting
there
said
rodriguez
he
he
loves
me
not
said
morano
he
would
surely
kill
you
replied
rodriguez
morano
looked
sideways
at
his
it
would
therefore
be
better
continued
rodriguez
that
you
should
stay
in
this
camp
while
i
give
such
greetings
of
ceremony
in
lowlight
as
courtesy
demands
i
will
stay
master
said
morano
rodriguez
was
glad
that
this
was
settled
for
he
felt
that
to
follow
his
dreams
of
so
many
nights
to
that
balconied
house
in
lowlight
with
morano
would
be
no
better
than
visiting
a
house
accompanied
by
a
dog
that
had
bitten
one
of
the
family
i
will
stay
repeated
morano
but
master
the
fat
man
eyes
were
all
supplication
yes
said
rodriguez
leave
me
your
mandolin
implored
morano
my
mandolin
said
rodriguez
master
said
morano
that
señor
who
likes
my
fat
body
so
ill
he
would
kill
me
he
well
said
rodriguez
for
morano
was
hesitating
he
likes
your
mandolin
no
better
master
rodriguez
resented
a
slight
to
his
mandolin
as
much
as
a
slight
to
his
sword
but
he
smiled
as
he
looked
at
morano
anxious
face
he
would
kill
you
for
your
mandolin
morano
went
on
eagerly
as
he
would
kill
me
for
my
and
at
the
mention
of
that
rodriguez
frowned
although
it
had
given
him
many
a
good
meal
since
the
night
it
offended
in
lowlight
and
he
would
sooner
have
gone
to
the
wars
without
a
sword
than
under
the
balcony
of
his
heart
desire
without
a
mandolin
so
rodriguez
would
hear
no
more
of
morano
request
and
soon
he
left
the
fire
and
went
to
lie
down
but
morano
sighed
and
sat
gazing
on
into
the
embers
unhappily
while
thoughts
plodded
slow
through
his
mind
leading
to
nothing
late
that
night
he
threw
fresh
logs
on
the
so
that
when
they
awoke
there
was
still
fire
in
the
embers
and
when
they
had
eaten
their
breakfast
rodriguez
said
farewell
to
morano
saying
that
he
had
business
in
lowlight
that
might
keep
him
a
few
days
but
morano
said
not
farewell
then
for
he
would
follow
his
master
as
far
as
the
midday
halt
to
cook
his
next
meal
and
when
noon
came
they
were
beyond
the
forest
once
more
morano
cooked
bacon
then
while
rodriguez
slept
morano
took
his
cloak
and
did
all
that
could
be
done
by
brushing
and
smoothing
to
give
back
to
it
that
air
that
it
some
time
had
before
it
had
flapped
upon
so
many
winds
and
wrapped
rodriguez
on
such
various
beds
and
met
the
vicissitudes
that
make
this
story
for
the
plume
he
could
do
little
and
his
master
awoke
late
in
the
afternoon
and
went
to
his
horse
and
gave
morano
his
orders
he
was
to
go
back
with
two
of
the
horses
to
their
last
camp
in
the
forest
and
take
with
him
all
their
kit
except
one
blanket
and
make
himself
comfortable
there
and
wait
till
rodriguez
came
and
then
rodriguez
rode
slowly
away
and
morano
stood
gazing
mournfully
and
warningly
at
the
mandolin
and
the
warnings
were
not
lost
upon
rodriguez
though
he
would
never
admit
that
he
saw
in
morano
staring
eyes
any
wise
hint
that
he
heeded
and
morano
sighed
and
went
and
untethered
his
horses
and
soon
he
was
riding
lonely
back
to
the
forest
and
rodriguez
taking
the
other
way
saw
at
once
the
towers
of
lowlight
does
my
reader
think
that
he
then
set
spurs
to
his
horse
galloping
towards
that
house
about
whose
balcony
his
dreams
flew
every
night
no
it
was
far
from
evening
far
yet
from
the
colour
and
calm
in
which
the
light
with
never
a
whisper
says
farewell
to
earth
but
with
a
gesture
that
the
horizon
hides
takes
silent
leave
of
the
fields
on
which
she
has
danced
with
joy
far
yet
from
the
hour
that
shone
for
serafina
like
a
great
halo
round
her
and
round
her
mother
house
we
can
not
believe
that
one
hour
more
than
another
shone
upon
serafina
or
that
the
dim
end
of
the
evening
was
only
hers
but
these
are
the
chronicles
of
rodriguez
who
of
all
the
things
that
befell
him
treasured
most
his
memory
of
serafina
in
the
twilight
and
who
held
that
this
hour
was
hers
as
much
as
her
raiment
and
her
balcony
such
therefore
it
is
in
these
chronicles
and
so
he
loitered
waiting
for
the
slow
sun
to
set
and
when
at
last
a
tint
on
the
walls
of
lowlight
came
with
the
magic
of
earth
most
faery
hour
he
rode
in
slowly
not
perhaps
wholly
unwitting
for
all
his
anxious
thoughts
of
serafina
that
a
little
air
of
romance
from
the
spring
and
the
evening
followed
this
lonely
rider
from
some
way
off
he
saw
that
balcony
that
had
drawn
him
back
from
the
other
side
of
the
far
pyrenees
sometimes
he
knew
that
it
drew
him
and
mostly
he
knew
it
not
yet
always
that
curved
balcony
brought
him
nearer
ever
since
he
turned
from
the
field
of
the
false
don
alvidar
the
balcony
held
him
with
invisible
threads
such
as
those
with
which
earth
draws
in
the
birds
at
evening
and
there
was
serafina
in
her
balcony
when
rodriguez
saw
serafina
sitting
there
in
the
twilight
just
as
he
had
often
dreamed
he
looked
no
more
but
lowered
his
head
to
the
withered
rose
that
he
carried
now
in
his
hand
the
rose
that
he
had
found
by
that
very
balcony
under
another
moon
and
gazing
still
at
the
rose
he
rode
on
under
the
balcony
and
passed
it
until
his
were
heard
no
more
in
lowlight
and
he
and
his
horse
were
one
dim
shape
between
the
night
and
the
twilight
and
still
he
held
on
he
knew
not
yet
but
only
guessed
who
had
thrown
that
rose
from
the
balcony
on
the
night
when
he
slept
on
the
dust
he
knew
not
who
it
was
that
he
fought
on
the
same
night
and
dared
not
guess
what
that
unknown
hidalgo
might
be
to
serafina
he
had
no
claim
to
more
from
that
house
which
once
gave
him
so
cold
a
welcome
than
thus
to
ride
by
it
in
silence
and
he
knew
as
he
rode
that
the
cloak
and
the
plume
that
he
wore
scarce
seemed
the
same
as
those
that
had
floated
by
when
more
than
a
month
ago
he
had
ridden
past
that
balcony
and
the
withered
rose
that
he
carried
added
one
more
note
of
autumn
and
yet
he
hoped
and
so
he
rode
into
twilight
and
was
hid
from
the
sight
of
the
village
a
worn
pathetic
figure
trusting
vaguely
to
vague
powers
of
good
fortune
that
govern
all
men
but
that
favour
youth
and
sure
enough
it
was
not
yet
wholly
moonlight
when
cantering
hooves
came
down
the
road
behind
him
it
was
once
more
that
young
hidalgo
and
as
soon
as
he
drew
rein
beside
rodriguez
both
reached
out
merry
hands
as
though
their
former
meeting
had
been
some
errand
of
joy
and
as
rodriguez
looked
him
in
the
eyes
while
the
two
men
leaned
over
clasping
hands
in
light
still
clear
though
faded
he
could
not
doubt
serafina
was
his
sister
señor
said
his
old
enemy
will
you
tarry
with
us
in
our
house
a
few
days
if
your
journey
is
not
urgent
rodriguez
gasped
for
joy
for
the
messenger
from
lowlight
the
certainty
that
here
was
no
rival
the
summons
to
the
house
of
his
dreams
pilgrimage
came
all
together
his
hand
still
clasped
the
stranger
yet
he
answered
with
the
due
ceremony
that
that
age
and
land
demanded
then
they
turned
and
rode
together
towards
lowlight
and
first
the
young
men
told
each
other
their
names
and
the
stranger
told
how
he
dwelt
with
his
mother
and
sister
in
the
house
that
rodriguez
knew
and
his
name
was
don
alderon
of
the
valley
of
dawnlight
his
house
had
dwelt
in
that
valley
since
times
out
of
knowledge
but
then
the
moors
had
come
and
his
forbears
had
fled
to
lowlight
the
moors
were
gone
now
for
which
saint
michael
and
all
fighting
saints
be
praised
but
there
were
certain
difficulties
about
his
right
to
the
valley
of
dawnlight
so
they
dwelt
in
lowlight
still
and
rodriguez
told
of
the
war
that
there
was
beyond
the
pyrenees
and
how
the
just
cause
had
won
but
little
more
than
that
he
was
able
to
tell
for
he
knew
scarce
more
of
the
cause
for
which
he
had
fought
than
history
knows
of
it
who
chooses
her
incidents
and
seems
to
forget
so
much
and
as
they
talked
they
came
to
the
house
with
the
balcony
a
waning
moon
cast
light
over
it
that
was
now
no
longer
twilight
but
was
the
light
of
wild
things
of
the
woods
and
birds
of
prey
and
men
in
mountains
outlawed
by
the
king
and
magic
and
mystery
and
the
quests
of
love
serafina
had
left
her
place
lights
gleamed
now
in
the
windows
and
when
the
door
was
opened
the
hall
seemed
to
rodriguez
so
much
less
hugely
hollow
so
much
less
full
of
ominous
whispered
echoes
that
his
courage
rose
high
as
he
went
through
it
with
alderon
and
they
entered
the
room
together
that
they
had
entered
together
before
in
the
long
room
beyond
many
candles
he
saw
dona
serafina
and
her
mother
rising
up
to
greet
him
neither
the
ceremonies
of
that
age
nor
rodriguez
natural
calm
would
have
entirely
concealed
his
emotion
had
not
his
face
been
hidden
as
he
bowed
they
spoke
to
him
they
asked
him
of
his
travels
rodriguez
answered
with
effort
he
saw
by
their
manner
that
don
alderon
must
have
explained
much
in
his
favour
he
had
this
time
to
cheer
him
a
very
different
greeting
and
yet
he
felt
little
more
at
ease
than
when
he
had
stood
there
late
at
night
before
with
one
eye
bandaged
and
wearing
only
one
shoe
suspected
of
he
knew
not
what
brawling
and
violence
it
was
not
until
dona
mirana
the
mother
of
serafina
asked
him
to
play
to
them
on
his
mandolin
that
rodriguez
ease
returned
he
bowed
then
and
brought
round
his
mandolin
which
had
been
slung
behind
him
and
knew
a
triumphant
champion
was
by
him
now
one
old
in
the
ways
of
love
and
wise
in
the
sorrows
of
man
a
slender
but
potent
voice
to
tell
what
there
were
not
words
to
say
a
voice
unhindered
by
language
unlimited
even
by
thought
whose
universal
meaning
was
heard
and
understood
sometimes
perhaps
by
wandering
spirits
of
light
beaten
far
by
some
evil
thought
for
their
heavenly
courses
and
passing
close
along
the
coasts
of
earth
and
rodriguez
played
no
tune
he
had
ever
known
nor
any
airs
that
he
had
heard
men
play
in
lanes
in
andalusia
but
he
told
of
things
that
he
knew
not
of
sadnesses
that
he
had
scarcely
felt
and
undreamed
exaltations
it
was
the
hour
of
need
and
the
mandolin
knew
and
when
all
was
told
that
the
mandolin
can
tell
of
whatever
is
wistfulest
in
the
spirit
of
man
a
mood
of
merriment
entered
its
old
curved
sides
and
there
came
from
its
hollows
a
measure
such
as
they
dance
to
when
laughter
goes
over
the
greens
in
spain
never
a
song
sang
rodriguez
the
mandolin
said
all
and
what
message
did
serafina
receive
from
those
notes
that
were
strange
even
to
rodriguez
were
they
not
stranger
to
her
i
have
said
that
spirits
blown
far
out
of
their
course
and
nearing
the
mundane
coasts
hear
mortal
music
sometimes
and
hearing
understand
and
if
they
can
not
understand
those
snatches
of
song
all
about
mortal
things
and
human
needs
that
are
wafted
rarely
to
them
by
chance
passions
how
much
more
surely
a
young
mortal
heart
so
near
rodriguez
heard
what
he
would
say
and
understood
the
message
however
strange
when
dona
mirana
and
her
daughter
rose
exchanging
their
little
curtsies
for
the
low
bows
of
rodriguez
and
so
retired
for
the
night
the
long
room
seemed
to
rodriguez
now
empty
of
threatening
omens
the
great
portraits
that
the
moon
had
lit
and
that
had
frowned
at
him
in
the
moonlight
when
he
came
here
before
frowned
at
him
now
no
longer
the
anger
that
he
had
known
to
lurk
in
the
darkness
on
pictured
faces
of
dead
generations
had
gone
with
the
gloom
that
it
haunted
they
were
all
passionless
now
in
the
quiet
light
of
the
candles
he
looked
again
at
the
portraits
eye
to
eye
remembering
looks
they
had
given
him
in
the
moonlight
and
all
looked
back
at
him
with
ages
of
apathy
and
he
knew
that
whatever
glimmer
of
former
selves
there
lurks
about
portraits
of
the
dead
and
gone
was
thinking
only
of
their
own
past
days
in
years
remote
from
rodriguez
whether
their
anger
had
flashed
for
a
moment
over
the
ages
on
that
night
a
month
from
now
or
whether
it
was
only
the
moonlight
he
never
knew
their
spirits
were
back
now
surely
amongst
their
own
days
whence
they
deigned
not
to
look
on
the
days
that
make
these
chronicles
not
till
then
did
rodriguez
admit
or
even
know
that
he
had
not
eaten
since
his
noonday
meal
but
now
he
admitted
this
to
don
questions
and
don
alderon
led
him
to
another
chamber
and
there
regaled
him
with
all
the
hospitality
for
which
that
time
was
famous
and
when
rodriguez
had
eaten
don
alderon
sent
for
wine
and
the
butler
brought
it
in
an
olden
flagon
dark
wine
of
a
precious
vintage
and
soon
the
two
young
men
were
drinking
together
and
talking
of
the
wickedness
of
the
moors
and
while
they
talked
the
night
grew
late
and
chilly
and
still
and
the
hour
came
when
moths
are
fewer
and
young
men
think
of
bed
then
don
alderon
showed
his
guest
to
an
upper
room
a
long
room
dim
with
red
hangings
and
carvings
in
walnut
and
oak
which
the
one
candle
he
carried
barely
lit
but
only
set
queer
shadows
scampering
and
here
he
left
rodriguez
who
was
soon
in
bed
with
the
great
red
hangings
round
him
and
awhile
he
wondered
at
the
huge
silence
of
the
house
all
round
him
with
never
a
murmur
never
an
echo
never
a
sigh
for
he
missed
the
passing
of
winds
branches
waving
the
stirring
of
small
beasts
birds
of
prey
calling
and
the
hundred
sounds
of
the
night
but
soon
through
the
silence
came
sleep
he
did
not
need
to
dream
for
here
in
the
home
of
serafina
he
had
come
to
his
dreams
end
another
day
shone
on
another
scene
for
the
sunlight
that
went
in
a
narrow
stream
of
gold
and
silver
between
the
huge
red
curtains
had
sent
away
the
shadows
that
had
stalked
overnight
through
the
room
and
had
scattered
the
eeriness
that
had
lurked
on
the
far
side
of
furniture
and
all
the
dimness
was
gone
that
the
long
red
room
had
harboured
and
for
a
while
rodriguez
did
not
know
where
he
was
and
for
a
while
when
he
remembered
he
could
not
believe
it
true
he
dressed
with
care
almost
with
fear
and
preened
his
small
moustachios
which
at
last
had
grown
again
just
when
he
would
have
despaired
then
he
descended
and
found
that
he
had
slept
late
though
the
three
of
that
ancient
house
were
seated
yet
at
the
table
and
serafina
all
dressed
in
white
seemed
to
rodriguez
to
be
shining
in
rivalry
with
the
morning
ah
dreams
and
fancies
of
youth
the
eleventh
chronicle
how
he
turned
to
gardening
and
his
sword
rested
these
were
the
days
that
rodriguez
always
remembered
and
side
by
side
with
them
there
lodged
in
his
memory
and
went
down
with
them
into
his
latter
years
the
days
and
nights
when
he
went
through
the
pyrenees
and
walked
when
he
would
have
slept
but
had
to
walk
or
freeze
and
by
some
queer
rule
that
guides
us
he
treasured
them
both
in
his
memory
these
happy
days
in
this
garden
and
the
frozen
nights
on
the
peaks
for
serafina
showed
rodriguez
the
garden
that
behind
the
house
ran
narrow
and
long
to
the
wild
there
were
rocks
with
heliotrope
pouring
over
them
and
flowers
peeping
behind
them
and
great
azaleas
all
in
triumphant
bloom
and
ropes
of
flowering
creepers
coming
down
from
trees
and
oleanders
and
a
plant
named
popularly
joy
of
the
south
and
small
paths
went
along
it
edged
with
shells
brought
from
the
far
sea
there
was
only
one
street
in
the
village
and
you
did
not
go
far
among
the
great
azaleas
before
you
lost
sight
of
the
gables
and
you
did
not
go
far
before
the
small
paths
ended
with
their
shells
from
the
distant
sea
and
there
was
the
mistress
of
all
gardeners
facing
you
mother
nature
nursing
her
children
the
things
of
the
wild
she
too
had
azaleas
and
oleanders
but
they
stood
more
solitary
in
their
greater
garden
than
those
that
grew
in
the
garden
of
dona
mirana
and
she
too
had
little
paths
only
they
were
without
borders
and
without
end
yet
looking
from
the
long
and
narrow
garden
at
the
back
of
that
house
in
lowlight
to
the
wider
garden
that
sweeps
round
the
world
and
is
fenced
by
space
from
the
garden
in
venus
and
by
space
from
the
garden
in
mars
you
scarce
saw
any
difference
or
noticed
where
they
met
the
solitary
azaleas
beyond
were
gathered
together
by
distance
and
from
lowlight
to
the
horizon
seemed
all
one
garden
in
bloom
and
afterwards
all
his
years
whenever
rodriguez
heard
the
name
of
spain
spoken
by
loyal
men
it
was
thus
that
he
thought
of
it
as
he
saw
it
now
and
here
he
used
to
walk
with
serafina
when
she
tended
flowers
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
or
went
at
evening
to
water
favourite
blooms
and
rodriguez
would
bring
with
him
his
mandolin
and
sometimes
he
touched
it
lightly
or
even
sang
as
they
rested
on
some
carved
seat
at
the
garden
end
looking
out
towards
shadowy
shrubs
on
the
shining
hill
but
mostly
he
heard
her
speak
of
the
things
she
loved
of
what
moths
flew
to
their
garden
and
which
birds
sang
and
how
the
flowers
grew
serafina
sat
no
longer
in
her
balcony
but
disguising
idleness
by
other
names
they
loitered
along
those
paths
that
the
seashells
narrowed
yet
there
was
a
grace
in
their
loitering
such
as
we
have
not
in
our
dances
now
and
evening
stealing
in
from
the
wild
places
from
darkening
azaleas
upon
distant
hills
still
found
them
in
the
garden
found
rodriguez
singing
in
idleness
undisguised
or
anxiously
helping
in
some
trivial
task
tying
up
some
tendril
that
had
gone
awry
helping
some
magnolia
that
the
wind
had
wounded
almost
unnoticed
by
him
the
sunlight
would
disappear
and
the
coloured
blaze
of
the
sunset
and
then
the
gloaming
till
the
colours
of
all
the
flowers
queerly
changed
and
they
shone
with
that
curious
glow
which
they
wear
in
the
dusk
they
returned
then
to
the
house
the
garden
behind
them
with
its
dim
hushed
air
of
a
secret
before
them
the
candlelight
like
a
different
land
and
after
the
evening
meal
alderon
and
rodriguez
would
sit
late
together
discussing
the
future
of
the
world
rodriguez
holding
that
it
was
intended
that
the
earth
should
be
ruled
by
spain
and
alderon
fearing
it
would
all
go
to
the
moors
days
passed
thus
and
then
one
evening
rodriguez
was
in
the
garden
with
serafina
the
flowers
dim
and
pale
and
more
mysterious
than
ever
poured
out
their
scent
towards
the
coming
night
luring
huge
from
the
far
dusk
that
was
gathering
about
the
garden
to
hover
before
each
bloom
on
myriad
wingbeats
too
rapid
for
human
eye
another
inch
and
the
fairies
had
peeped
out
from
behind
azaleas
yet
both
of
these
late
loiterers
felt
fairies
were
surely
there
it
seemed
to
be
nature
own
most
secret
hour
upon
which
man
trespasses
if
he
venture
forth
from
his
house
an
owl
from
his
hidden
haunt
flew
nearer
the
garden
and
uttered
a
clear
call
once
to
remind
rodriguez
of
this
and
rodriguez
did
not
heed
but
walked
in
silence
he
had
played
his
mandolin
it
had
uttered
to
the
solemn
hush
of
the
understanding
evening
all
it
was
able
to
tell
and
after
that
cry
grown
piteous
with
so
many
human
longings
for
it
was
an
old
mandolin
rodriguez
felt
there
was
nothing
left
for
his
poor
words
to
say
so
he
went
dumb
and
mournful
serafina
would
have
heard
him
had
he
spoken
for
her
thoughts
vibrated
yet
with
the
voice
of
the
mandolin
which
had
come
to
her
hearing
as
an
ambassador
from
rodriguez
but
he
found
no
words
to
match
with
the
mandolin
high
mood
his
eyes
said
and
his
sighs
told
what
the
mandolin
had
uttered
but
his
tongue
was
silent
and
then
serafina
said
as
he
walked
all
heavy
with
silence
past
a
curving
slope
of
dimly
glowing
azaleas
you
like
flowers
señor
señorita
i
adore
them
he
replied
indeed
said
dona
serafina
indeed
i
do
said
rodriguez
and
yet
asked
dona
serafina
was
it
not
a
somewhat
withered
or
altogether
faded
flower
that
you
carried
unless
i
fancied
wrong
when
you
rode
past
our
balcony
it
was
indeed
faded
said
rodriguez
for
the
rose
was
some
weeks
old
one
who
loved
flowers
i
thought
said
serafina
would
perhaps
care
more
for
them
fresh
though
rodriguez
was
his
shrewdness
did
not
desert
him
to
have
said
that
he
had
the
rose
from
serafina
would
have
been
to
claim
as
though
proven
what
was
yet
no
more
than
a
hope
señorita
he
said
i
found
the
flower
on
holy
ground
i
did
not
know
she
said
that
you
had
travelled
so
far
i
found
it
here
he
said
under
your
balcony
perchance
i
let
it
fall
said
she
it
was
idle
of
me
i
guard
it
still
he
said
and
drew
forth
that
worn
brown
rose
it
was
idle
of
me
said
serafina
but
then
in
that
scented
garden
among
the
dim
lights
of
late
evening
the
ghost
of
that
rose
introduced
their
spirits
one
to
the
other
so
that
the
listening
flowers
heard
rodriguez
telling
the
story
of
his
heart
and
bending
over
the
path
heard
answer
and
all
they
seemed
to
do
was
but
to
watch
the
evening
with
leaves
uplifted
in
the
hope
of
rain
film
after
film
of
dusk
dropped
down
from
where
twilight
had
been
like
an
army
of
darkness
slowly
pitching
their
tents
on
ground
that
had
been
lost
to
the
children
of
light
out
of
the
wild
lands
all
the
owls
flew
nearer
their
long
clear
cries
and
the
huge
hush
between
them
warned
all
those
lands
that
this
was
not
man
hour
and
neither
rodriguez
nor
serafina
heard
them
in
pale
blue
sky
where
none
had
thought
to
see
it
one
smiling
star
appeared
it
was
venus
watching
lovers
as
men
of
the
crumbled
centuries
had
besought
her
to
do
when
they
named
her
so
long
ago
kneeling
upon
their
hills
with
bended
heads
and
arms
stretched
out
to
her
sweet
eternal
scrutiny
beneath
her
wandering
rays
as
they
danced
down
to
bless
them
rodriguez
and
serafina
talked
low
in
the
sight
of
the
goddess
and
their
voices
swayed
through
the
flowers
with
whispers
and
winds
not
troubling
the
little
wild
creatures
that
steal
out
shy
in
the
dusk
and
nature
forgave
them
for
being
abroad
in
that
hour
although
so
near
that
a
single
azalea
seemed
to
hide
it
so
near
seemed
to
beckon
and
whisper
old
nature
eldest
secret
when
flowers
glimmered
and
venus
smiled
and
all
things
else
were
dim
they
turned
on
one
of
those
little
paths
hand
in
hand
homeward
dona
mirana
glanced
once
at
her
daughter
eyes
and
said
nothing
don
alderon
renewed
his
talk
with
rodriguez
giving
reasons
for
his
apprehension
of
the
conquest
of
the
world
by
the
moors
which
he
had
thought
of
since
last
night
and
rodriguez
agreed
with
all
that
don
alderon
said
but
understood
little
being
full
of
dreams
that
seemed
to
dance
on
the
further
side
of
the
candlelight
to
a
strange
new
unheard
tune
that
his
heart
was
aware
of
he
gazed
much
at
serafina
and
said
little
he
drank
no
wine
that
night
with
don
alderon
what
need
had
he
of
wine
on
wonderful
journeys
that
my
pen
can
not
follow
for
all
the
swiftness
of
the
wing
from
which
it
came
on
darting
journeys
outspeeding
the
lithe
swallow
or
that
great
wanderer
the
goose
his
young
thoughts
raced
by
a
myriad
of
golden
evenings
far
down
the
future
years
and
what
of
the
days
he
saw
did
he
see
them
truly
enough
that
he
saw
them
in
vision
saw
them
as
some
lone
shepherd
on
lifted
downs
sees
once
go
by
with
music
a
galleon
out
of
the
east
with
windy
sails
and
masts
ablaze
with
pennants
and
heroes
in
strange
dress
singing
new
songs
and
the
galleon
goes
nameless
by
till
the
singing
dies
away
what
ship
was
it
whither
bound
why
there
enough
that
he
has
seen
it
thus
do
we
glimpse
the
glory
of
rare
days
as
we
swing
round
the
sun
and
youth
is
like
some
high
headland
from
which
to
see
on
the
next
day
he
spoke
with
dona
mirano
there
was
little
to
say
but
to
observe
the
courtesies
appropriate
to
this
occasion
for
dona
mirana
and
her
daughter
had
spoken
long
together
already
and
of
one
thing
he
could
say
little
and
indeed
was
dumb
when
asked
of
it
and
that
was
the
question
of
his
home
and
then
he
said
that
he
had
a
castle
and
when
dona
mirana
asked
him
where
it
was
he
said
vaguely
it
was
to
the
north
he
trusted
the
word
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
so
he
spoke
of
his
castle
as
a
man
speaks
the
truth
and
when
she
asked
him
of
his
castle
again
whether
on
rock
or
river
or
in
leafy
lands
he
began
to
describe
how
its
ten
towers
stood
being
builded
of
a
rock
that
was
slightly
pink
and
how
they
glowed
across
a
hundred
fields
especially
at
evening
and
suddenly
he
ceased
perceiving
all
in
a
moment
he
was
speaking
unwittingly
in
the
words
of
don
alvidar
and
describing
to
dona
mirana
that
castle
on
ebro
and
dona
mirana
knew
then
that
there
was
some
mystery
about
rodriguez
home
she
spoke
kindly
to
rodriguez
yet
she
neither
gave
her
consent
nor
yet
withheld
it
and
he
knew
there
was
no
immediate
hope
in
her
words
graceful
as
were
his
bows
as
he
withdrew
he
left
with
scarcely
another
word
to
say
all
day
his
castle
hung
over
him
like
a
cloud
not
nebulous
and
evanescent
only
but
brooding
darkly
boding
storms
such
as
the
orange
blossoms
dread
he
walked
again
in
the
garden
with
serafina
but
dona
mirana
was
never
far
and
the
glamour
of
the
former
evening
lit
by
one
star
was
driven
from
the
garden
by
his
anxieties
about
that
castle
of
which
he
could
not
speak
serafina
asked
him
of
his
home
he
would
not
parry
her
question
and
yet
he
could
not
tell
her
that
all
their
future
hung
on
the
promise
of
a
man
in
an
old
leathern
jacket
calling
himself
a
king
so
the
mystery
of
his
habitation
deepened
spoiling
the
glamour
of
the
evening
he
spoke
instead
of
the
forest
hoping
she
might
know
something
of
that
strange
monarch
to
whom
they
dwelt
so
near
but
she
glanced
uneasily
towards
shadow
valley
and
told
him
that
none
in
lowlight
went
that
way
sorrow
grew
heavier
round
rodriguez
heart
at
this
believing
in
the
promise
of
a
man
whose
eyes
he
trusted
he
had
asked
serafina
to
marry
him
and
serafina
had
said
yes
and
now
he
found
she
knew
nothing
of
such
a
man
which
seemed
somehow
to
rodriguez
to
weaken
his
promise
and
worst
of
all
she
feared
the
place
where
he
lived
he
welcomed
the
approach
of
dona
mirana
and
all
three
returned
to
the
house
for
the
rest
of
that
evening
he
spoke
little
but
he
had
formed
his
project
when
the
two
ladies
retired
rodriguez
who
had
seemed
for
many
hours
turned
to
don
alderon
his
mother
had
told
don
alderon
nothing
yet
for
she
was
troubled
by
the
mystery
of
rodriguez
castle
and
would
give
him
time
to
make
it
clear
if
he
could
for
there
was
something
about
rodriguez
of
which
with
many
pages
i
have
tried
to
acquaint
my
reader
but
which
was
clear
when
first
she
saw
him
to
dona
mirana
in
fact
she
liked
him
at
once
as
i
hope
that
perhaps
by
now
my
reader
may
he
turned
to
don
alderon
who
was
surprised
to
see
the
vehemence
with
which
his
guest
suddenly
spoke
after
those
hours
of
silence
and
rodriguez
told
him
the
story
of
his
love
and
the
story
of
both
his
castles
that
which
had
vanished
from
the
bank
of
the
ebro
and
that
which
was
promised
him
by
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
often
don
alderon
interrupted
oh
rodriguez
he
said
you
are
welcome
to
our
ancient
unfortunate
house
and
later
he
said
i
have
met
no
man
that
had
a
prettier
way
with
the
sword
but
rodriguez
held
on
to
the
end
telling
all
he
had
to
tell
and
especially
that
he
was
landless
and
penniless
but
for
that
one
promise
and
as
for
the
sword
he
said
he
was
but
as
a
child
playing
before
the
sword
of
don
alderon
and
this
don
alderon
said
was
in
no
wise
so
though
there
were
a
few
cunning
passes
that
he
had
learned
hoping
that
the
day
might
come
for
him
to
do
god
a
service
thereby
by
slaying
some
of
the
moors
and
heartily
he
gave
his
consent
and
felicitation
but
this
rodriguez
would
not
have
come
with
me
he
said
to
the
forest
to
the
place
where
i
met
this
man
and
if
we
find
him
not
there
we
will
go
to
the
house
in
which
his
bowmen
feast
and
there
have
news
of
him
and
he
shall
show
us
the
castle
of
his
promise
and
if
it
be
such
a
castle
as
you
approve
then
your
consent
shall
be
given
but
if
not
gladly
indeed
said
don
alderon
we
will
start
tomorrow
and
rodriguez
took
his
words
literally
though
his
host
had
meant
no
more
than
what
we
should
call
one
of
these
days
but
rodriguez
was
being
consumed
with
a
great
impatience
and
so
they
arranged
it
and
don
alderon
went
to
bed
with
a
feeling
which
is
favourable
to
dreams
that
on
the
next
day
they
went
upon
an
adventure
for
neither
he
nor
anyone
in
that
village
had
entered
shadow
valley
once
more
next
morning
rodriguez
walked
with
serafina
with
something
of
the
romance
of
the
garden
gone
for
dona
mirana
walked
there
too
and
romance
is
like
one
of
those
sudden
wonderful
colours
that
flash
for
a
moment
out
of
a
drop
of
dew
a
passing
shadow
obscures
them
and
ask
another
to
see
it
and
the
colour
is
not
the
same
move
but
a
yard
and
the
ray
of
enchantment
is
gone
dona
mirana
saw
the
romance
of
that
garden
but
she
saw
it
from
thirty
years
away
it
was
all
different
what
she
saw
all
changed
from
a
certain
day
for
love
was
love
in
the
old
days
and
to
rodriguez
and
serafina
it
seemed
that
she
could
not
see
romance
at
all
and
somehow
that
dimmed
it
almost
their
eyes
seemed
to
search
amongst
the
azaleas
for
the
romance
of
that
other
evening
and
then
rodriguez
told
serafina
that
he
was
riding
away
with
her
brother
to
see
about
the
affairs
of
his
castle
and
that
they
would
return
in
a
few
days
scarcely
a
hint
he
gave
that
those
affairs
might
not
prosper
for
he
trusted
the
word
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
his
confidence
had
returned
and
soon
with
swords
at
side
and
cloaks
floating
brilliant
on
light
winds
of
april
rodriguez
and
alderon
rode
away
together
soon
in
the
distance
they
saw
shadow
valley
and
then
rodriguez
bethought
him
of
morano
and
of
the
foul
wrong
he
committed
against
don
alderon
with
his
and
how
he
was
there
in
the
camp
to
which
he
was
bringing
his
friend
and
so
he
said
that
vile
knave
morano
still
lives
and
insists
on
serving
me
if
he
be
near
said
don
alderon
i
pray
you
to
disarm
him
of
his
for
the
sake
of
my
honour
which
does
not
suffer
me
to
be
stricken
with
culinary
weapons
but
only
with
the
sword
the
lance
or
even
bolts
of
cannon
or
arquebuss
he
was
thinking
of
yet
more
weapons
when
rodriguez
put
spurs
to
his
horse
he
is
near
he
said
i
will
ride
on
and
disarm
him
so
rodriguez
came
cantering
into
the
forest
while
don
alderon
ambled
a
mile
or
so
behind
him
and
there
he
found
his
old
camp
and
saw
morano
sitting
upon
the
ground
by
a
small
fire
morano
sprang
up
at
once
with
joy
in
his
eyes
his
face
wreathed
with
questions
which
he
did
not
put
into
words
for
he
did
not
pry
openly
into
his
master
affairs
morano
said
rodriguez
give
me
your
my
said
morano
yes
said
rodriguez
and
when
he
held
in
his
hand
that
blackened
greasy
utensil
he
told
morano
that
señor
you
met
in
lowlight
rides
with
me
the
cheerfulness
faded
out
of
morano
face
as
light
fades
at
sunset
master
he
said
he
will
surely
slay
me
now
he
will
not
slay
you
said
rodriguez
master
morano
said
he
hopes
for
my
fat
carcase
as
much
as
men
hope
for
the
unicorn
when
they
wear
their
bright
green
coats
and
hunt
him
with
dogs
in
spring
i
know
not
what
legend
morano
stored
in
his
mind
nor
how
much
of
it
was
true
and
when
he
finds
me
without
my
he
will
surely
slay
me
that
señor
said
rodriguez
emphatically
must
not
be
hit
with
the
that
is
a
hard
rule
master
said
morano
and
rodriguez
was
indignant
when
he
heard
that
that
anyone
should
thus
blaspheme
against
an
obvious
law
of
chivalry
while
morano
only
thought
was
upon
the
injustice
of
giving
up
the
sweets
of
life
for
the
sake
of
a
thus
they
were
at
and
for
some
while
they
stood
silent
while
rodriguez
hung
the
reins
of
his
horse
over
the
broken
branch
of
a
tree
and
then
don
alderon
rode
into
the
wood
all
then
that
was
most
pathetic
in
morano
sense
of
injustice
looked
out
of
his
eyes
as
he
turned
them
upon
his
master
but
don
alderon
scarcely
glanced
at
all
at
morano
even
when
he
handed
to
him
the
reins
of
his
horse
as
he
walked
on
towards
rodriguez
and
there
in
that
leafy
place
they
rested
all
through
the
evening
for
they
had
not
started
so
early
upon
their
journey
as
travellers
should
eight
days
had
gone
since
rodriguez
had
left
that
small
camp
to
ride
to
lowlight
and
to
the
apex
of
his
life
towards
which
all
his
days
had
ascended
and
in
that
time
morano
had
collected
good
store
of
wood
and
in
little
ways
unthought
of
by
dwellers
in
cities
had
made
the
place
like
such
homes
as
wanderers
find
don
alderon
was
charmed
with
their
roof
of
towering
greenness
and
with
the
choirs
of
those
which
inhabited
it
and
which
were
now
all
coming
home
to
sing
and
at
some
moment
in
the
twilight
neither
rodriguez
nor
alderon
noticed
when
morano
repossessed
himself
of
his
unbidden
by
rodriguez
but
acting
on
a
certain
tacit
permission
that
there
seemed
to
be
in
the
twilight
or
in
the
mood
of
the
two
young
men
as
they
sat
by
the
fire
and
soon
he
was
cooking
once
more
at
a
fire
of
his
own
with
something
of
the
air
that
you
see
upon
a
field
marshal
face
who
has
lost
his
baton
and
found
it
again
have
you
ever
noticed
it
reader
and
when
the
meal
was
ready
morano
served
it
in
silence
moving
unobtrusively
in
the
gloom
of
the
wood
for
he
knew
that
he
was
forgiven
yet
not
so
openly
that
he
wished
to
insist
on
his
presence
or
even
to
imply
his
possession
of
the
weapon
that
fried
the
bacon
so
like
a
dryad
he
moved
from
tree
to
tree
and
like
any
fabulous
creature
was
gone
again
and
the
two
young
men
supped
well
and
sat
on
and
on
watching
the
sparks
go
up
on
innumerable
journeys
from
the
fire
at
which
they
sat
to
be
lost
to
sight
in
huge
wastes
of
blackness
and
stars
lost
to
sight
utterly
lost
like
the
spirit
of
man
to
the
gaze
of
our
wonder
when
we
try
to
follow
its
journey
beyond
the
hearths
that
we
know
all
the
next
day
they
rode
on
through
the
forest
till
they
came
to
the
black
circle
of
the
old
fire
of
their
next
camp
and
here
rodriguez
halted
on
account
of
the
attraction
that
one
of
his
old
camps
seems
to
have
for
a
wanderer
it
drew
his
feet
towards
it
this
blackened
circle
this
hearth
that
for
one
night
made
one
spot
in
the
wilderness
home
don
alderon
did
not
care
whether
they
tarried
or
hurried
he
loved
his
journey
through
this
leafy
land
the
cool
slipping
round
the
was
new
to
him
and
new
was
the
comradeship
of
the
abundant
stars
the
quest
itself
was
a
joy
to
him
with
his
fancy
he
built
rodriguez
mysterious
castle
no
less
magnificently
than
did
don
alvidar
sometimes
they
talked
of
the
castle
each
of
the
young
men
picturing
it
as
he
saw
it
but
in
the
warmth
of
the
after
morano
slept
they
talked
of
more
than
these
chronicles
can
tell
in
the
morning
they
pressed
on
as
fast
as
the
forest
low
boughs
would
allow
them
they
passed
somewhere
near
the
great
cottage
in
which
the
bowmen
feasted
but
they
held
on
as
they
had
decided
after
discussion
to
do
for
the
last
place
in
which
rodriguez
had
seen
the
king
of
shadow
valley
which
was
the
place
of
his
promise
and
before
any
dimness
came
even
to
the
forest
or
golden
shafts
down
colonnades
which
were
before
all
cathedrals
they
found
the
old
camp
that
they
sought
which
still
had
a
clear
flavour
of
magic
for
morano
on
account
of
the
coming
and
going
of
his
three
horses
after
he
had
tied
them
to
that
tree
and
here
they
looked
for
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
then
rodriguez
called
him
and
then
all
three
of
them
called
him
shouting
king
of
shadow
valley
all
together
no
answer
came
the
woods
were
without
echo
nothing
stirred
but
fallen
leaves
but
before
those
miles
of
silence
could
depress
them
rodriguez
hit
upon
a
simple
plan
which
was
that
he
and
alderon
should
search
all
round
far
from
the
track
while
morano
stayed
in
the
camp
and
shouted
frequently
and
they
would
not
go
out
of
hearing
of
his
voice
for
shadow
valley
had
a
reputation
of
being
a
bad
forest
for
travellers
to
find
their
way
there
indeed
few
ever
attempted
to
so
they
did
as
he
said
he
and
alderon
searching
in
different
directions
while
morano
remained
in
the
camp
lifting
a
large
and
melancholy
voice
and
though
rumour
said
it
was
hard
to
find
the
way
when
twenty
yards
from
the
track
in
shadow
valley
it
did
not
say
it
was
hard
to
find
the
green
bowmen
and
rodriguez
knowing
that
they
guarded
the
forest
as
the
shadows
of
trees
guard
the
coolness
was
assured
he
would
meet
with
some
of
them
even
though
he
should
miss
their
master
so
he
and
alderon
searched
till
the
forest
darkness
came
and
only
birds
on
high
branches
still
had
light
and
they
never
saw
the
king
of
shadow
valley
or
any
trace
whatever
of
any
man
and
alderon
first
returned
to
the
encampment
but
rodriguez
searched
on
into
the
night
searching
and
calling
through
the
darkness
and
feeling
as
every
minute
went
by
and
every
faint
call
of
morano
that
his
castle
was
fading
away
slipping
past
and
to
take
its
place
among
the
unpitying
stars
and
when
he
returned
at
last
from
his
useless
search
he
found
morano
standing
by
a
good
fire
and
the
sight
of
it
a
little
cheered
rodriguez
and
the
sight
of
the
firelight
on
morano
face
and
the
homely
comfort
of
the
camp
for
everything
is
comparative
and
over
their
supper
rodriguez
and
alderon
agreed
that
they
had
come
to
a
part
of
the
forest
too
remote
from
the
home
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
decided
to
go
the
next
day
to
the
house
of
the
green
bowmen
and
before
he
slept
rodriguez
felt
once
more
that
all
was
well
with
his
castle
yet
when
the
next
day
came
they
searched
again
for
rodriguez
remembered
how
it
was
to
this
very
place
that
the
king
of
shadow
valley
had
bidden
him
come
in
four
weeks
and
though
this
period
was
not
yet
accomplished
he
felt
and
alderon
fully
agreed
they
had
waited
long
enough
so
they
searched
all
the
morning
and
then
fulfilled
their
decision
of
overnight
by
riding
for
the
great
cottage
rodriguez
knew
all
the
way
they
met
no
one
and
rodriguez
gaiety
came
back
as
they
rode
for
he
and
don
alderon
recognised
more
and
more
clearly
that
the
bowmen
great
cottage
was
the
place
they
should
have
gone
at
first
in
early
evening
they
were
just
at
their
journey
end
but
barely
had
they
left
the
track
that
they
had
ridden
the
day
before
barely
taken
the
smaller
path
that
led
after
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
cottage
when
they
found
themselves
stopped
by
huge
chains
that
hung
from
tree
to
tree
high
into
the
trees
went
the
chains
above
their
heads
where
they
sat
their
horses
and
a
chain
ran
every
six
inches
down
to
the
very
ground
the
road
was
well
blocked
rodriguez
and
alderon
hastily
consulted
then
leaving
the
horses
with
morano
they
followed
the
chains
through
dense
forest
to
find
a
place
where
they
could
get
the
horses
through
finding
the
chains
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
as
evening
was
drawing
in
the
two
friends
divided
alderon
going
back
and
rodriguez
on
agreeing
to
meet
again
on
the
path
where
morano
was
it
was
darkening
when
they
met
there
rodriguez
having
found
nothing
but
that
iron
barrier
going
on
from
trunk
to
trunk
and
alderon
having
found
a
great
gateway
of
iron
but
it
was
shut
through
the
silent
shadows
stealing
abroad
at
evening
the
three
men
crashed
their
way
on
foot
leading
their
horses
towards
this
gate
but
their
way
was
slow
and
difficult
for
no
path
at
all
led
up
to
it
it
was
dark
when
they
reached
it
and
they
saw
the
high
gate
in
the
night
a
black
barrier
among
the
trees
where
no
one
would
wish
to
come
and
in
forest
that
seemed
to
these
three
to
be
nearly
impenetrable
and
what
astonished
rodriguez
most
of
all
was
that
the
chains
had
not
been
across
the
path
when
he
had
feasted
with
the
green
bowmen
they
stood
there
gazing
all
three
at
the
dark
locked
gate
and
then
they
saw
two
shields
that
met
in
the
midst
of
it
and
rodriguez
mounted
his
horse
and
stretched
up
to
feel
what
device
there
was
on
the
beaten
iron
and
both
the
shields
were
blank
there
they
camped
as
well
as
men
can
when
darkness
has
fallen
before
they
reach
their
and
morano
lit
a
great
fire
before
the
gate
and
the
smooth
blank
shields
touching
shoulders
there
up
above
them
shone
on
rodriguez
and
alderon
in
the
firelight
for
a
while
they
wondered
at
that
strange
gate
that
stood
there
dividing
the
wilderness
and
then
sleep
came
as
soon
as
they
woke
they
called
loudly
but
no
one
guarded
that
gate
no
step
but
theirs
stirred
in
the
forest
then
leaving
morano
in
the
camp
with
its
great
gate
that
led
nowhere
the
two
young
men
climbed
up
by
branches
and
chains
and
were
soon
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
and
pressing
on
through
the
silence
of
the
forest
to
find
the
cottage
in
which
rodriguez
had
slept
and
almost
at
once
the
green
bowmen
appeared
ten
of
them
with
their
bows
in
front
of
rodriguez
and
alderon
stop
said
the
ten
green
bowmen
when
the
bowmen
said
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
what
do
you
seek
said
the
bowmen
the
king
of
shadow
valley
answered
rodriguez
he
is
not
here
they
said
where
is
he
asked
rodriguez
he
is
nowhere
said
one
when
he
does
not
wish
to
be
seen
then
show
me
the
castle
that
he
promised
me
said
rodriguez
we
know
nothing
of
any
castle
said
one
of
the
bowmen
and
they
all
shook
their
heads
no
castle
said
rodriguez
no
they
said
has
the
king
of
shadow
valley
no
castle
he
asked
beginning
now
to
despair
we
know
of
none
they
said
he
lives
in
the
forest
before
rodriguez
quite
despaired
he
asked
each
one
if
they
knew
not
of
any
castle
of
which
their
king
was
possessed
and
each
of
them
said
that
there
was
no
castle
in
all
shadow
valley
the
ten
still
stood
in
front
of
them
with
their
bows
and
rodriguez
turned
away
then
indeed
in
despair
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
camp
and
alderon
walked
behind
him
in
silence
they
reached
their
camp
by
the
great
gate
that
led
nowhere
and
there
rodriguez
sat
down
on
a
log
beside
the
dwindling
fire
gazing
at
the
grey
ashes
and
thinking
of
his
dead
hopes
he
had
not
the
heart
to
speak
to
alderon
and
the
silence
was
unbroken
by
morano
who
for
all
his
loquacity
knew
when
his
words
were
not
welcome
don
alderon
tried
to
break
that
melancholy
silence
saying
that
these
ten
bowmen
did
not
know
the
whole
world
but
he
could
not
cheer
rodriguez
for
sitting
there
in
dejection
on
his
log
thinking
of
all
the
assurance
with
which
he
had
often
spoken
of
his
castle
there
was
one
more
thing
to
trouble
him
than
don
alderon
knew
and
this
was
that
when
the
bowmen
had
appeared
he
had
hung
once
more
round
his
neck
that
golden
badge
that
was
worked
for
him
by
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
they
must
have
seen
it
and
they
had
paid
no
heed
to
it
whatever
its
magic
was
wholly
departed
and
one
thing
troubled
him
that
rodriguez
did
not
know
a
very
potent
factor
in
human
sorrow
he
had
left
in
the
morning
so
eagerly
that
he
had
had
no
breakfast
and
this
he
entirely
forgot
and
knew
not
how
much
of
his
dejection
came
from
this
cause
thinking
that
the
loss
of
his
castle
was
of
itself
enough
so
with
downcast
head
he
sat
empty
and
hopeless
and
the
little
camp
was
silent
in
this
mournful
atmosphere
while
no
one
spoke
and
no
one
seemed
to
watch
stood
when
at
last
rodriguez
raised
his
head
with
folded
arms
before
the
gate
to
nowhere
the
king
of
shadow
valley
his
face
was
surly
as
though
the
face
of
a
ghost
called
from
important
work
among
asteroids
needing
his
care
by
the
trivial
legerdemain
of
some
foolish
novice
rodriguez
looking
into
those
angry
eyes
wholly
forgot
it
was
he
that
had
a
grievance
the
silence
continued
and
then
the
king
of
shadow
valley
spoke
when
have
i
broken
my
word
he
said
rodriguez
did
not
know
the
man
was
still
looking
at
him
still
standing
there
with
folded
arms
before
the
great
gate
confronting
him
demanding
some
kind
of
answer
and
rodriguez
had
nothing
to
say
i
came
because
you
promised
me
the
castle
he
said
at
last
i
did
not
bid
you
come
here
the
man
with
the
folded
arms
answered
i
went
where
you
bade
me
said
rodriguez
and
you
were
not
there
in
four
weeks
i
said
answered
the
king
angrily
and
then
alderon
spoke
have
you
any
castle
for
my
friend
he
said
no
said
the
king
of
shadow
valley
you
promised
him
one
said
don
alderon
the
king
of
shadow
valley
raised
with
his
left
hand
a
horn
that
hung
below
his
elbow
by
a
green
cord
round
his
body
he
made
no
answer
to
don
alderon
but
put
the
horn
against
his
lips
and
blew
they
watched
him
all
three
in
silence
till
the
silence
was
broken
by
many
men
moving
swiftly
through
covert
and
the
green
bowmen
appeared
when
seven
or
eight
were
there
he
turned
and
looked
at
them
when
have
i
broken
my
word
he
said
to
his
men
and
they
all
answered
him
never
more
broke
into
sight
through
the
bushes
ask
them
he
said
and
rodriguez
did
not
speak
ask
them
he
said
again
when
i
have
broken
my
word
still
rodriguez
and
alderon
said
nothing
and
the
bowmen
answered
them
he
has
never
broken
his
word
every
bowman
said
you
promised
me
a
castle
said
rodriguez
seeing
that
man
fierce
eyes
upon
him
still
then
do
as
i
bid
you
answered
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
he
turned
round
and
touched
the
lock
of
the
gates
with
some
key
that
he
had
the
gates
moved
open
and
the
king
went
through
don
alderon
ran
forward
after
him
and
caught
up
with
him
as
he
strode
away
and
spoke
to
him
and
the
king
answered
rodriguez
did
not
hear
what
they
said
and
never
afterwards
knew
these
words
he
heard
only
from
the
king
of
shadow
valley
as
he
and
don
alderon
parted
and
therefore
señor
it
were
better
for
some
holy
man
to
do
his
blessed
work
before
we
come
and
the
king
of
shadow
valley
passed
into
the
deeps
of
the
wood
as
the
great
gates
were
slowly
swinging
to
don
alderon
came
back
thoughtfully
the
gates
clanged
clicked
and
were
shut
again
the
king
of
shadow
valley
and
all
his
bowmen
were
gone
don
alderon
went
to
his
horse
and
rodriguez
and
morano
did
the
same
drawn
by
the
act
of
the
only
man
of
the
three
that
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
don
alderon
led
his
horse
back
toward
the
path
and
rodriguez
followed
with
his
when
they
came
to
the
path
they
mounted
in
silence
and
presently
morano
followed
them
with
his
blankets
rolled
up
in
front
of
him
on
his
horse
and
his
slung
behind
him
which
way
said
rodriguez
home
said
don
alderon
but
i
can
not
go
to
your
home
said
rodriguez
come
said
don
alderon
as
one
whose
plans
were
made
rodriguez
without
a
home
without
plans
without
hope
went
with
don
alderon
as
thistledown
goes
with
the
warm
wind
they
rode
through
the
forest
till
it
grew
all
so
dim
that
only
a
faint
tinge
of
greenness
lay
on
the
dark
leaves
above
were
patches
of
bluish
sky
like
broken
pieces
of
steel
and
a
star
or
two
were
out
when
they
left
the
forest
and
cantering
on
they
came
to
lowlight
when
the
milky
way
appeared
and
there
were
dona
mirana
and
serafina
in
the
hall
to
greet
them
as
they
entered
the
door
what
news
they
asked
but
rodriguez
hung
back
he
had
no
news
to
give
it
was
don
alderon
that
went
forward
speaking
cheerily
to
serafina
and
afterwards
to
his
mother
with
whom
he
spoke
long
and
anxiously
pointing
toward
the
forest
sometimes
almost
as
rodriguez
thought
in
fear
and
a
little
later
when
the
ladies
had
retired
don
alderon
told
rodriguez
over
the
wine
with
which
he
had
tried
to
cheer
his
forlorn
companion
that
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
marry
serafina
and
when
rodriguez
lamented
that
this
was
impossible
he
replied
that
the
king
of
shadow
valley
wished
it
and
when
rodriguez
heard
this
his
astonishment
equalled
his
happiness
for
he
marvelled
that
don
alderon
should
not
only
believe
that
strange
man
unsupported
promise
but
that
he
should
even
obey
him
as
though
he
held
him
in
awe
and
on
the
next
day
rodriguez
spoke
with
dona
mirana
as
they
walked
in
the
glory
of
the
garden
and
dona
mirana
gave
him
her
consent
as
don
alderon
had
done
and
when
rodriguez
spoke
humbly
of
postponement
she
glanced
uneasily
towards
shadow
valley
as
though
she
too
feared
the
strange
man
who
ruled
over
the
forest
which
she
had
never
entered
and
so
it
was
that
rodriguez
walked
with
his
lady
with
the
sweet
serafina
in
that
garden
again
and
walking
there
they
forgot
the
need
of
house
or
land
forgot
shadow
valley
with
its
hopes
and
its
doubts
and
all
the
anxieties
of
the
thoughts
that
we
take
for
the
morrow
and
when
evening
came
and
the
birds
sang
in
azaleas
and
the
shadows
grew
solemn
and
long
and
winds
blew
cool
from
the
blazing
bed
of
the
sun
into
the
garden
now
all
strange
and
still
they
forgot
our
earth
and
beyond
the
mundane
coasts
drifted
on
dreams
of
their
own
into
aureate
regions
of
twilight
to
wander
in
lands
wherein
lovers
walk
briefly
and
only
once
the
twelfth
chronicle
the
building
of
castle
rodriguez
and
the
ending
of
these
chronicles
when
the
king
of
shadow
valley
met
rodriguez
for
the
first
time
in
the
forest
and
gave
him
his
promise
and
left
him
by
his
he
went
back
some
way
towards
the
bowmen
cottage
and
blew
his
horn
and
his
hundred
bowmen
were
about
him
almost
at
once
to
these
he
gave
their
orders
and
they
went
back
whence
they
had
come
into
the
darkness
but
he
went
to
the
bowmen
cottage
and
paced
before
it
a
dark
and
lonely
figure
of
the
night
and
wherever
he
paced
the
ground
he
marked
it
with
small
sticks
and
next
morning
the
hundred
bowmen
came
with
axes
as
soon
as
the
earliest
light
had
entered
the
forest
and
each
of
them
chose
out
one
of
the
giant
trees
that
stood
before
the
cottage
and
attacked
it
all
day
they
swung
their
axes
against
the
forest
elders
of
which
nearly
a
hundred
were
fallen
when
evening
came
and
the
stoutest
of
these
great
trunks
that
were
four
feet
through
were
dragged
by
horses
to
the
bowmen
cottage
and
laid
by
the
little
sticks
that
the
king
of
shadow
valley
had
put
overnight
in
the
ground
the
bowmen
cottage
and
the
kitchen
that
was
in
the
wood
behind
it
and
a
few
trees
that
still
stood
were
now
all
enclosed
by
four
lines
of
fallen
trees
which
made
a
large
rectangle
on
the
ground
with
a
small
square
at
each
of
its
corners
and
craftsmen
came
and
smoothed
and
hollowed
the
inner
sides
of
the
four
rows
of
trees
working
far
into
the
night
so
was
the
first
day
work
accomplished
and
so
was
built
the
first
layer
of
the
walls
of
castle
rodriguez
on
the
next
day
the
bowmen
again
felled
a
hundred
trees
the
top
of
the
first
layer
was
cut
flat
by
carpenters
at
evening
the
second
layer
was
hoisted
up
after
their
under
sides
had
been
flattened
to
fit
the
layer
below
them
quantities
more
were
cast
in
to
make
the
floor
when
they
had
been
gradually
smoothed
and
fitted
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
a
man
could
not
see
over
the
walls
of
castle
rodriguez
and
on
the
third
day
more
craftsmen
arrived
men
from
distant
villages
at
the
edge
whence
the
king
of
shadow
valley
had
summoned
them
and
they
carved
the
walls
as
they
grew
and
a
hundred
trees
fell
that
day
and
the
castle
was
another
layer
higher
and
all
the
while
a
park
was
growing
in
the
forest
as
they
felled
the
great
trees
but
the
greatest
trees
of
all
the
bowmen
spared
oaks
that
had
stood
there
for
ages
and
ages
of
men
they
left
them
to
grip
the
earth
for
a
while
longer
for
a
few
more
human
generations
on
the
fourth
day
the
two
windows
at
the
back
of
the
bowmen
cottage
began
to
darken
and
that
evening
castle
rodriguez
was
fifteen
feet
high
and
still
the
hundred
bowmen
hewed
at
the
forest
bringing
sunlight
bright
on
to
grass
that
was
shadowed
by
oaks
for
ages
and
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day
they
began
to
roof
the
lower
rooms
and
make
their
second
floor
and
still
the
castle
grew
a
layer
a
day
though
the
second
storey
they
built
with
thinner
trees
that
were
only
three
feet
through
which
were
more
easily
carried
to
their
place
by
the
pulleys
and
now
they
began
to
heap
up
rocks
in
a
mass
of
mortar
against
the
wall
on
the
outside
till
a
steep
slope
guarded
the
whole
of
the
lower
part
of
the
castle
against
fire
from
any
attacker
if
war
should
come
that
way
in
any
of
the
centuries
that
were
yet
to
be
and
the
deep
windows
they
guarded
with
bars
of
iron
the
shape
of
the
castle
showed
itself
clearly
now
rising
on
each
side
of
the
bowmen
cottage
and
behind
it
with
a
tower
at
each
of
its
corners
to
the
left
of
the
old
cottage
the
main
doorway
opened
to
the
great
hall
in
which
a
pile
of
a
few
huge
oaks
was
being
transformed
into
a
massive
stair
three
figures
of
strange
men
held
up
this
ceiling
with
their
heads
and
uplifted
hands
when
the
castle
was
finished
but
as
yet
the
carvers
had
only
begun
their
work
so
that
only
here
and
there
an
eye
peeped
out
or
a
smile
flickered
to
give
any
expression
to
the
curious
faces
of
these
fabulous
creatures
of
the
wood
which
were
slowly
taking
their
shape
out
of
three
trees
whose
roots
were
still
in
the
earth
below
the
floor
in
an
upper
storey
one
of
these
trees
became
a
tall
cupboard
and
the
shelves
and
the
sides
and
the
back
and
the
top
of
it
were
all
one
piece
of
oak
all
the
interior
of
the
castle
was
of
wood
hollowed
into
alcoves
and
polished
or
carved
into
figures
leaning
out
from
the
walls
so
vast
were
the
timbers
that
the
walls
at
a
glance
seemed
almost
one
piece
of
wood
and
the
centuries
that
were
coming
to
spain
darkened
the
walls
as
they
came
through
autumnal
shades
until
they
were
all
black
as
though
they
all
mourned
in
secret
for
lost
generations
but
they
have
not
yet
crumbled
the
fireplaces
they
made
with
great
square
red
tiles
which
they
also
put
in
the
chimneys
amongst
rude
masses
of
mortar
and
these
great
dark
holes
remained
always
mysterious
to
those
that
looked
for
mystery
in
the
family
that
whiled
away
the
ages
in
that
castle
and
by
every
fireplace
two
queer
carved
creatures
stood
upholding
the
mantlepiece
with
mystery
in
their
faces
and
curious
limbs
uniting
the
hearth
with
fable
and
with
tales
told
in
the
wood
years
after
the
men
that
carved
them
were
all
dust
the
shadows
of
these
creatures
would
come
out
and
dance
in
the
room
on
wintry
nights
when
all
the
lamps
were
gone
and
flames
stole
out
and
flickered
above
the
smouldering
logs
in
the
second
storey
one
great
saloon
ran
all
the
length
of
the
castle
in
it
was
a
long
table
with
eight
legs
that
had
carvings
of
roses
rambling
along
its
edges
the
table
and
its
legs
were
all
of
one
piece
with
the
floor
they
would
never
have
hollowed
the
great
trunk
in
time
had
they
not
used
fire
the
second
storey
was
barely
complete
on
the
day
that
rodriguez
and
don
alderon
and
morano
came
to
the
chains
that
guarded
the
park
and
the
king
of
shadow
valley
would
not
permit
his
gift
to
be
seen
in
anything
less
than
its
full
magnificence
and
had
commanded
that
no
man
in
the
world
might
enter
to
see
the
work
of
his
bowmen
and
craftsmen
until
it
should
frown
at
all
comers
a
castle
formidable
as
any
in
spain
and
then
they
heaped
up
the
mortar
and
rock
to
the
top
of
the
second
storey
but
above
that
they
let
the
timbers
show
except
where
they
filled
in
plaster
between
the
curving
trunks
and
the
ages
blackened
the
timber
in
amongst
the
white
plaster
but
not
a
storm
that
blew
in
all
the
years
that
came
nor
the
moss
of
so
many
springs
ever
rotted
away
those
beams
that
the
forest
had
given
and
on
which
the
bowmen
had
laboured
so
long
ago
but
the
castle
weathered
the
ages
and
reached
our
days
worn
battered
even
by
its
journey
through
the
long
and
sometimes
troubled
years
but
splendid
with
the
traffic
that
it
had
with
history
in
many
gorgeous
periods
here
valdar
the
excellent
came
once
in
his
youth
and
charles
the
magnificent
stayed
a
night
in
this
castle
when
on
a
pilgrimage
to
a
holy
place
of
the
south
it
was
here
that
peter
the
arrogant
in
his
cups
gave
africa
one
spring
night
to
his
sister
son
what
grandeurs
this
castle
has
seen
what
chronicles
could
be
writ
of
it
but
not
these
chronicles
for
they
draw
near
their
close
and
they
have
yet
to
tell
how
the
castle
was
built
others
shall
tell
what
banners
flew
from
all
four
of
its
towers
adding
a
splendour
to
the
wind
and
for
what
cause
they
flew
i
have
yet
to
tell
of
their
building
the
second
storey
was
roofed
and
castle
rodriguez
still
rose
one
layer
day
by
day
with
a
hauling
at
pulleys
and
the
work
of
a
hundred
men
and
all
the
while
the
park
swept
farther
into
the
forest
and
the
trees
that
grew
up
through
the
building
were
worked
by
the
craftsmen
in
every
chamber
into
which
they
grew
and
a
great
branch
of
the
hugest
of
them
made
a
little
crooked
stair
in
an
upper
storey
on
the
floors
they
laid
down
skins
of
beasts
that
the
bowmen
slew
in
the
forest
and
on
the
walls
there
hung
all
manner
of
leather
tooled
and
dyed
as
they
had
the
art
to
do
in
that
period
in
spain
when
the
third
storey
was
finished
they
roofed
the
castle
over
laying
upon
the
huge
rafters
red
tiles
that
they
made
of
clay
but
the
towers
were
not
yet
finished
at
this
time
the
king
of
shadow
valley
sent
a
runner
into
lowlight
to
shoot
a
blunt
arrow
with
a
message
tied
to
it
into
don
garden
near
to
the
door
at
evening
and
they
went
on
building
the
towers
above
the
height
of
the
roof
and
near
the
top
of
them
they
made
homes
for
archers
little
turrets
that
leaned
like
swallows
nests
out
from
each
tower
high
places
where
they
could
see
and
shoot
and
not
be
seen
from
below
and
little
narrow
passages
wound
away
behind
perched
battlements
of
stone
by
which
archers
could
slip
from
place
to
place
and
shoot
from
here
or
from
there
and
never
be
known
so
were
built
in
that
distant
age
the
towers
of
castle
rodriguez
and
one
day
four
weeks
from
the
felling
of
the
first
oak
the
period
of
his
promise
being
accomplished
the
king
of
shadow
valley
blew
his
horn
and
standing
by
what
had
been
the
bowmen
cottage
now
all
shut
in
by
sheer
walls
of
castle
rodriguez
he
gathered
his
bowmen
to
him
and
when
they
were
all
about
him
he
gave
them
their
orders
they
were
to
go
by
stealth
to
the
village
of
lowlight
and
were
to
be
by
daylight
before
the
house
of
don
alderon
and
whether
wed
or
unwed
whether
she
fled
or
folk
defended
the
house
to
bring
dona
serafina
of
the
valley
of
dawnlight
to
be
the
chatelaine
of
castle
rodriguez
for
this
purpose
he
bade
them
take
with
them
a
chariot
that
he
thought
magnificent
though
the
mighty
timbers
that
gave
grandeur
to
castle
rodriguez
had
a
cumbrous
look
in
the
heavy
vehicle
that
was
to
the
bowmen
eyes
the
triumphal
car
of
the
forest
so
they
took
their
bows
and
obeyed
leaving
the
craftsmen
at
their
work
in
the
castle
which
was
now
quite
roofed
over
towers
and
all
they
went
through
the
forest
by
little
paths
that
they
knew
going
swiftly
and
warily
in
the
bowmen
way
and
just
before
nightfall
they
were
at
the
forest
edge
though
they
went
no
farther
from
it
than
its
shadows
go
in
the
evening
and
there
they
rested
under
the
oak
trees
for
the
early
part
of
the
night
except
those
whose
art
it
was
to
gather
news
for
their
king
and
three
of
those
went
into
lowlight
and
mixed
with
the
villagers
there
when
white
mists
moved
over
the
fields
near
dawn
and
wavered
ghostly
about
lowlight
the
green
bowman
moved
with
them
and
just
out
of
hearing
of
the
village
behind
wild
shrubs
that
hid
them
the
bowmen
that
were
coming
from
the
forest
met
the
three
that
had
spent
the
night
in
taverns
of
lowlight
and
the
three
told
the
hundred
of
the
great
wedding
that
there
was
to
be
in
the
church
of
the
renunciation
that
morning
in
lowlight
and
of
the
preparations
that
were
made
and
how
holy
men
had
come
from
far
on
mules
and
had
slept
the
night
in
the
village
and
the
bishop
of
toledo
himself
would
bless
the
sword
the
bowmen
therefore
retired
a
little
way
and
moving
through
the
mists
came
forward
to
points
whence
they
could
watch
the
church
well
concealed
on
the
wild
plain
which
here
and
there
gave
up
a
field
to
man
but
was
mostly
the
playground
of
wild
creatures
whose
ways
were
the
bowmen
ways
and
here
they
waited
this
was
the
wedding
of
rodriguez
and
serafina
of
which
gossips
often
spoke
at
their
doors
in
summer
evenings
old
women
mumbling
of
fair
weddings
that
each
had
seen
and
they
had
been
children
when
they
saw
this
wedding
they
were
those
that
threw
small
handfuls
of
anemones
on
the
path
before
the
porch
they
told
the
tale
of
it
till
they
could
tell
no
more
it
is
the
account
of
the
last
two
or
three
of
them
old
old
women
that
came
at
last
to
these
chronicles
so
that
their
tongues
may
wag
as
it
were
a
little
longer
through
these
pages
although
they
have
been
for
so
many
centuries
dead
and
this
is
all
that
books
are
able
to
do
first
there
was
and
many
voices
and
then
the
voices
hushed
and
there
came
the
procession
of
eight
divines
of
murcia
whose
vestments
were
strange
to
lowlight
then
there
came
a
priest
from
the
south
near
the
border
of
andalusia
who
overnight
had
sanctified
the
ring
it
was
he
who
had
entertained
rodriguez
when
he
first
escaped
from
la
garda
and
rodriguez
had
sent
for
him
now
each
note
of
the
bells
came
clear
through
the
hush
as
they
entered
the
church
and
then
with
suitable
attendants
the
bishop
strode
by
and
they
saw
quite
close
the
blessed
cope
of
toledo
and
the
bridegroom
followed
him
in
wearing
his
sword
and
don
alderon
went
with
him
and
then
the
voices
rose
again
in
the
street
the
bells
rang
on
they
all
saw
dona
mirana
the
little
bunches
of
bright
anemones
grew
sticky
in
their
hands
the
bells
seemed
louder
cheering
rose
in
the
street
and
came
all
down
it
nearer
then
dona
serafina
walked
past
them
with
all
her
maids
and
that
is
what
the
gossips
chiefly
remembered
telling
how
she
smiled
at
them
and
praising
her
dress
through
those
distant
summer
evenings
then
there
was
music
in
the
church
and
afterwards
the
had
come
and
the
people
screamed
for
none
knew
what
they
would
do
but
they
bowed
so
low
to
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
showed
their
great
hunting
bows
so
willingly
to
all
who
wished
to
see
that
the
people
lost
their
alarm
and
only
feared
lest
the
bishop
of
toledo
should
blast
the
merry
bowmen
with
one
of
his
curses
and
presently
the
bride
and
bridegroom
entered
the
chariot
and
the
people
cheered
and
there
were
farewells
and
the
casting
of
flowers
and
the
bishop
blessed
three
of
their
bows
and
a
fat
man
sat
beside
the
driver
with
folded
arms
wearing
bright
on
his
face
a
look
of
foolish
contentment
and
the
bowmen
and
bride
and
bridegroom
all
went
away
to
the
forest
four
huge
white
horses
drew
that
bridal
chariot
the
bowmen
ran
beside
it
and
soon
it
was
lost
to
sight
of
the
girls
that
watched
it
from
lowlight
but
their
memories
held
it
close
till
their
eyes
could
no
longer
see
to
knit
and
they
could
only
sit
by
their
porches
in
fine
weather
and
talk
of
the
days
that
were
so
came
rodriguez
and
his
bride
to
the
forest
he
silent
perplexed
wondering
always
to
what
home
and
what
future
he
brought
her
she
knowing
less
than
he
and
trusting
more
and
on
the
untended
road
that
the
bowmen
shared
with
stags
and
with
rare
very
venturous
travellers
the
wheels
of
the
woodland
chariot
sank
so
deep
in
the
sandy
earth
that
the
escort
of
bowmen
needed
seldom
to
run
any
more
and
he
who
sat
by
the
driver
climbed
down
and
walked
silent
for
once
perhaps
awed
by
the
occasion
though
he
was
none
other
than
morano
serafina
was
delighted
with
the
forest
but
between
rodriguez
and
its
beautiful
grandeur
his
anxieties
crowded
thickly
he
leaned
over
once
from
the
chariot
and
asked
one
of
the
bowmen
again
about
that
castle
but
the
bowman
only
bowed
and
answered
with
a
proverb
of
spain
not
easily
carried
so
far
from
its
own
soil
to
thrive
in
our
language
but
signifying
that
the
morrow
showeth
all
things
he
was
silent
then
for
he
knew
that
there
was
no
way
to
a
direct
answer
through
those
proverbs
and
after
a
while
perhaps
there
came
to
him
some
of
serafina
trustfulness
by
evening
they
came
to
a
wide
avenue
leading
to
great
gates
rodriguez
did
not
know
the
avenue
he
knew
no
paths
so
wide
in
shadow
valley
but
he
knew
those
gates
they
were
the
gates
of
iron
that
led
nowhere
but
now
an
avenue
went
from
them
upon
the
other
side
and
opened
widely
into
a
park
dotted
with
clumps
of
trees
and
the
two
great
iron
shields
they
too
had
changed
with
the
changes
that
had
bewitched
the
forest
for
their
surfaces
that
had
glowed
so
unmistakably
blank
side
by
side
in
the
firelight
not
many
nights
before
blazoned
now
the
armorial
bearings
of
rodriguez
upon
the
one
and
those
of
the
house
of
dawnlight
upon
the
other
through
the
opened
gates
they
entered
the
young
park
that
seemed
to
wonder
at
its
own
ancient
trees
where
wild
deer
drifted
away
from
them
like
shadows
through
the
evening
for
the
bowmen
had
driven
in
deer
for
miles
through
the
forest
they
passed
a
pool
where
lay
in
languid
beauty
for
hundreds
of
summers
but
as
yet
no
flower
peeped
into
the
water
for
the
pond
was
all
hallowed
newly
a
clump
of
trees
stood
right
ahead
of
their
way
they
passed
round
it
and
castle
rodriguez
came
all
at
once
into
view
serafina
gasped
joyously
rodriguez
saw
its
towers
its
turrets
for
archers
its
guarded
windows
deep
in
the
mass
of
stone
its
solemn
row
of
battlements
but
he
did
not
believe
what
he
saw
he
did
not
believe
that
here
at
last
was
his
castle
that
here
was
his
dream
fulfilled
and
his
journey
done
he
expected
to
wake
suddenly
in
the
cold
in
some
lonely
camp
he
expected
the
ebro
to
unfold
its
coils
in
the
north
and
to
come
and
sweep
it
away
it
was
but
another
strayed
hope
he
thought
taking
the
form
of
dream
but
castle
rodriguez
still
stood
frowning
there
and
none
of
its
towers
vanished
or
changed
as
things
change
in
dreams
but
the
servants
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
opened
the
great
door
and
serafina
and
rodriguez
entered
and
all
the
hundred
bowmen
disappeared
here
we
will
leave
them
and
let
these
chronicles
end
for
whoever
would
tell
more
of
castle
rodriguez
must
wield
one
of
those
ponderous
pens
that
hangs
on
the
study
wall
in
the
house
of
historians
great
days
in
the
story
of
spain
shone
on
those
windows
and
things
were
said
in
its
banqueting
chamber
and
planned
in
its
inner
rooms
that
sometimes
turned
that
story
this
way
or
that
as
rocks
turn
a
young
river
and
as
a
traveller
meets
a
mighty
river
at
one
of
its
bends
and
passes
on
his
path
while
the
river
sweeps
on
to
its
estuary
and
the
sea
so
i
leave
the
triumphs
and
troubles
of
that
story
which
i
touched
for
one
moment
by
the
door
of
castle
rodriguez
my
concern
is
but
with
rodriguez
and
serafina
and
to
tell
that
they
lived
here
in
happiness
and
to
tell
that
the
humble
morano
found
his
happiness
too
for
he
became
the
magnificent
steward
of
castle
rodriguez
the
majordomo
and
upon
august
occasions
he
wore
as
much
red
plush
as
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
dreams
when
he
saw
this
very
event
sleeping
by
dying
and
he
slept
not
upon
straw
but
upon
good
heaps
of
but
pining
a
little
in
the
second
year
of
his
somewhat
lonely
splendour
he
married
one
of
the
maidens
of
the
forest
the
child
of
a
bowman
that
hunted
boars
with
their
king
and
all
the
green
bowmen
came
and
built
him
a
house
by
the
gates
of
the
park
whence
he
walked
solemnly
on
proper
occasions
to
wait
upon
his
master
morano
good
faithful
man
come
forward
for
but
a
moment
out
of
the
golden
age
and
bow
across
all
those
centuries
to
the
reader
say
one
farewell
to
him
in
your
spanish
tongue
though
the
sound
of
it
be
no
louder
than
the
sound
of
shadows
moving
and
so
back
to
the
dim
splendour
of
the
past
for
the
señor
or
señora
shall
hear
your
name
no
more
for
years
rodriguez
lived
a
chieftain
of
the
forest
owning
the
overlordship
of
the
king
of
shadow
valley
whom
he
and
serafina
would
entertain
with
all
the
magnificence
of
which
their
castle
was
capable
on
such
occasions
as
he
appeared
before
the
iron
gates
they
seldom
saw
him
sometimes
they
heard
his
horn
as
he
went
by
they
heard
his
bowmen
follow
and
all
would
pass
and
perhaps
they
would
see
none
but
upon
occasions
he
came
he
came
to
the
christening
of
the
eldest
son
of
rodriguez
and
serafina
for
whom
he
was
godfather
he
came
again
to
see
the
boy
shoot
for
the
first
time
with
a
bow
and
later
he
came
to
give
little
presents
small
treasures
of
the
forest
to
daughters
who
treated
him
always
not
as
sole
lord
of
that
forest
that
travellers
dreaded
but
as
a
friend
of
their
very
own
that
they
had
found
for
themselves
he
had
his
favourites
among
them
and
none
quite
knew
which
they
were
and
one
day
he
came
in
his
old
age
to
give
rodriguez
a
message
and
he
spoke
long
and
tenderly
of
the
forest
as
though
all
its
glades
were
sacred
and
soon
after
that
day
he
died
and
was
buried
with
the
mourning
of
all
his
men
in
the
deeps
of
shadow
valley
where
only
rodriguez
and
the
bowmen
knew
and
rodriguez
became
as
the
old
king
had
commanded
the
ruler
of
shadow
valley
and
all
its
faithful
men
with
them
he
hunted
and
defended
the
forest
holding
all
its
ways
to
be
sacred
as
the
old
king
had
taught
it
is
told
how
rodriguez
ruled
the
forest
well
and
later
he
made
a
treaty
with
the
spanish
king
acknowledging
him
sole
lord
of
spain
including
shadow
valley
saving
that
certain
right
should
pertain
to
the
foresters
and
should
be
theirs
for
ever
and
these
rights
are
written
on
parchment
and
sealed
with
the
seal
of
spain
and
none
may
harm
the
forest
without
the
bowmen
leave
rodriguez
was
made
duke
of
shadow
valley
and
a
magnifico
of
the
first
degree
though
little
he
went
with
other
hidalgos
to
court
but
lived
with
his
family
in
shadow
valley
travelling
seldom
beyond
the
splendour
of
the
forest
farther
than
lowlight
thus
he
saw
the
glory
of
autumn
turning
the
woods
to
fairyland
and
when
the
stags
were
roaring
and
winter
coming
on
he
would
take
a
down
from
the
wall
and
go
hunting
through
the
forest
whose
twigs
were
black
and
slender
and
still
against
the
bright
menace
of
winter
spring
found
him
viewing
the
fields
that
his
men
had
sown
along
the
forest
edge
and
finding
in
the
chaunt
of
the
myriad
birds
a
stirring
of
memories
a
beckoning
towards
past
days
in
summer
he
would
see
his
boys
and
girls
at
play
running
through
shafts
of
sunlight
that
made
leaves
and
grass
like
pale
emeralds
he
gave
his
days
to
the
forest
and
the
four
seasons
thus
he
dwelt
amidst
splendours
such
as
history
has
never
seen
in
any
visit
of
hers
to
the
courts
of
men
of
him
and
serafina
it
has
been
written
and
sung
that
they
lived
happily
ever
after
and
though
they
are
now
so
many
centuries
dead
may
they
have
in
the
memories
of
such
of
my
readers
as
will
let
them
linger
there
that
afterglow
of
life
that
remembrance
gives
which
is
all
that
there
is
on
earth
for
those
that
walked
it
once
and
that
walk
the
paths
of
their
old
haunts
no
more
