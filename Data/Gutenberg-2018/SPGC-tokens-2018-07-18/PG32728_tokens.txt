my

i
have
related

heard
with
the
general
impressions
which
i
was
led
to
form
in
a
few
instances
when
opinions
were
conveyed
to
me
which
were
important
in
themselves

which
it
might
be

except
so

they

the

which
they

are

they

defence

british
race
dispersed

the
world
have
celebrated
the
jubilee
of
the
queen
with
an
enthusiasm
evidently
intended
to
bear
a
special
and
peculiar
meaning
the
people
of
these
islands
and
their
sons
and
brothers
and
friends
and
kinsfolk
in
canada
in
australia
and
in
new
zealand
have
declared
with
a
general
voice
scarcely
disturbed
by
a
discord
that
they
are
of
a
single
sovereign
that
they
are
united
in
feeling
united
in
loyalty
united
in
interest
and
that
they
wish
and
mean
to
preserve
unbroken
the
integrity
of
the
british
empire
this
is
the
answer
which
the
democracy
has
given
to
the
advocates
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
the
desire
for
union
while
it
lasts
is
its
own
realisation
as
long
as
we
have
no
wish
to
part
we
shall
not
part
and
the
wish
can
never
rise
if
when
there
is
occasion
we
can
meet
and
deliberate
together
with
the
same
regard
for
each
welfare
which
has
been
shown
in
the
late
conference
in
london
events
mock
at
human
foresight
and
nothing
is
certain
but
the
unforeseen
constitutional
government
and
an
independent
executive
were
conferred
upon
our
larger
colonies
with
the
express
and
scarcely
veiled
intention
that
at
the
earliest
moment
they
were
to
relieve
the
mother
country
of
responsibility
for
them
they
were
regarded
as
fledgelings
who
are
fed
only
by
the
parent
birds
till
their
feathers
are
grown
and
are
then
expected
to
shift
for
themselves
they
were
provided
with
the
full
plumage
of
parliamentary
institutions
on
the
home
pattern
and
model
and
the
expectation
of
experienced
politicians
was
that
they
would
each
at
the
earliest
moment
go
off
on
their
separate
accounts
and
would
bid
us
a
friendly
farewell
the
irony
of
fate
has
turned
to
folly
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
the
wise
themselves
the
same
political
party
which
were
most
anxious
twenty
years
ago
to
see
the
colonies
independent
and
contrived
constitutions
for
them
which
they
conceived
must
inevitably
lead
to
separation
appeal
now
to
the
effect
of
those
very
constitutions
in
drawing
the
empire
closer
together
as
a
reason
why
a
similar
method
should
be
immediately
adopted
to
heal
the
differences
between
great
britain
and
ireland
new
converts
to
any
belief
political
or
theological
are
proverbially
zealous
and
perhaps
in
this
instance
they
are
it
does
not
follow
that
because
people
of
the
same
race
and
character
are
drawn
together
by
equality
and
liberty
people
of
different
races
and
different
characters
who
have
quarrelled
for
centuries
will
be
similarly
attracted
to
one
another
yet
so
far
as
our
own
colonies
are
concerned
it
is
clear
that
the
abandonment
by
the
mother
country
of
all
pretence
to
interfere
in
their
internal
management
has
removed
the
only
cause
which
could
possibly
have
created
a
desire
for
independence
we
can
not
even
if
we
wish
it
ourselves
shake
off
connections
who
cost
us
nothing
and
themselves
refuse
to
be
divided
politicians
may
quarrel
the
democracies
have
refused
to
quarrel
and
the
result
of
the
wide
extension
of
the
suffrage
throughout
the
empire
has
been
to
show
that
being
one
the
british
people
everywhere
intend
to
remain
one
with
the
same
blood
the
same
language
the
same
habits
the
same
traditions
they
do
not
mean
to
be
shattered
into
dishonoured
fragments
all
of
us
wherever
we
are
can
best
manage
our
own
affairs
within
our
own
limits
yet
local
spheres
of
can
revolve
round
a
common
centre
while
there
is
a
centripetal
power
sufficient
to
hold
them
and
so
long
as
england
herself
is
true
and
continues
worthy
of
her
ancient
reputation
there
are
no
causes
working
visibly
above
the
political
horizon
which
are
likely
to
induce
our
colonies
to
take
wing
and
leave
us
the
strain
will
come
with
the
next
great
war
during
peace
these
colonies
have
only
experienced
the
advantage
of
union
with
us
they
will
then
have
to
share
our
dangers
and
may
ask
why
they
are
to
be
involved
in
quarrels
which
are
not
of
their
own
making
how
they
will
act
then
only
experience
can
tell
and
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
those
rapid
statesmen
who
would
rush
at
once
into
the
application
of
the
same
principle
to
countries
whose
continuance
with
us
is
vital
to
our
own
safety
whom
we
can
not
part
with
though
they
were
to
demand
it
at
the
cannon
mouth
but
the
result
of
the
experiment
is
an
encouragement
as
far
as
it
has
gone
to
those
who
would
extend
through
the
whole
of
our
colonial
system
it
seems
to
lead
as
a
direct
road
into
the
federation
which
has
fascinated
the
general
imagination
it
removes
friction
we
relieve
ourselves
of
responsibilities
if
federation
is
to
come
about
at
all
as
a
definite
and
effective
organisation
the
spontaneous
action
of
the
different
members
of
the
empire
in
a
position
in
which
they
are
free
to
stay
with
us
or
to
leave
us
as
they
please
appears
the
readiest
and
perhaps
the
only
means
by
which
it
can
be
brought
to
pass
so
plausible
is
the
theory
so
obviously
right
would
it
be
were
the
problem
as
simple
and
the
population
of
all
our
colonies
as
homogeneous
as
in
australia
that
one
can
not
wonder
at
the
ambition
of
politicians
to
win
themselves
a
name
and
achieve
a
great
result
by
the
immediate
adoption
of
it
great
results
generally
imply
effort
and
sacrifice
here
effort
is
unnecessary
and
sacrifice
is
not
demanded
everybody
is
to
have
what
he
wishes
and
the
effect
is
to
come
about
of
itself
when
we
think
of
india
when
we
think
of
ireland
prudence
tells
us
to
hesitate
steps
once
taken
in
this
direction
can
not
be
undone
even
if
found
to
lead
to
the
wrong
place
but
undoubtedly
wherever
it
is
possible
the
principle
of
ought
to
be
applied
in
our
colonies
and
will
be
applied
and
the
danger
now
is
that
it
will
be
tried
in
haste
in
countries
either
as
yet
unripe
for
it
or
from
the
nature
of
things
unfit
for
it
the
liberties
which
we
grant
freely
to
those
whom
we
trust
and
who
do
not
require
to
be
restrained
we
bring
into
disrepute
if
we
concede
them
as
readily
to
perversity
or
disaffection
or
to
those
who
like
most
asiatics
do
not
desire
liberty
and
prosper
best
when
they
are
led
and
guided
in
this
complex
empire
of
ours
the
problem
presents
itself
in
many
shapes
and
each
must
be
studied
and
dealt
with
according
to
its
character
there
is
the
broad
distinction
between
colonies
and
conquered
countries
colonists
are
part
of
ourselves
foreigners
attached
by
force
to
our
dominions
may
submit
to
be
ruled
by
us
but
will
not
always
consent
to
rule
themselves
in
accordance
with
our
views
or
interests
or
remain
attached
to
us
if
we
enable
them
to
leave
us
when
they
please
the
crown
therefore
as
in
india
rules
directly
by
the
police
and
the
army
and
there
are
colonies
which
are
neither
one
nor
the
other
where
our
own
people
have
been
settled
and
have
been
granted
the
land
in
possession
with
the
control
of
an
insubordinate
population
themselves
claiming
political
privileges
which
had
to
be
refused
to
the
rest
this
was
the
position
of
ireland
and
the
result
of
meddling
theoretically
with
it
ought
to
have
taught
us
caution
again
there
are
colonies
like
the
west
indies
either
occupied
originally
by
ourselves
as
barbadoes
or
taken
by
force
from
france
or
spain
where
the
mass
of
the
population
were
slaves
who
have
been
since
made
free
but
where
the
extent
to
which
the
coloured
people
can
be
admitted
to
share
in
the
administration
is
still
an
unsettled
question
to
throw
countries
so
variously
circumstanced
under
an
identical
system
would
be
a
wild
experiment
whether
we
ought
to
try
such
an
experiment
at
all
or
even
wish
to
try
it
and
prepare
the
way
for
it
depends
perhaps
on
whether
we
have
determined
that
under
all
circumstances
the
retention
of
them
under
our
own
flag
is
indispensable
to
our
safety
i
had
visited
our
great
pacific
colonies
circumstances
led
me
afterwards
to
attend
more
particularly
to
the
west
ladies
they
were
the
earliest
and
once
the
most
prized
of
all
our
distant
possessions
they
had
been
won
by
the
most
desperate
struggles
and
had
been
the
scene
of
our
greatest
naval
glories
in
the
recent
discussion
on
the
possibility
of
an
organised
colonial
federation
various
schemes
came
under
my
notice
in
every
one
of
which
the
union
of
the
west
indian
islands
under
a
free
parliamentary
constitution
was
regarded
as
a
necessary
preliminary
i
was
reminded
of
a
conversation
which
i
had
held
seventeen
years
ago
with
a
high
colonial
official
specially
connected
with
the
west
indian
department
in
which
the
federation
of
the
islands
under
such
a
constitution
was
spoken
of
as
a
measure
already
determined
on
though
with
a
view
to
an
end
exactly
the
opposite
of
that
which
was
now
desired
the
colonies
universally
were
then
regarded
in
such
quarters
as
a
burden
upon
our
resources
of
which
we
were
to
relieve
ourselves
at
the
earliest
moment
they
were
no
longer
of
special
value
to
us
the
whole
world
had
become
our
market
and
whether
they
were
nominally
attached
to
the
empire
or
were
independent
or
joined
themselves
to
some
other
power
was
of
no
commercial
moment
to
us
it
was
felt
however
that
as
long
as
any
tie
remained
we
should
be
obliged
to
defend
them
in
time
of
war
while
they
in
consequence
of
their
connection
would
be
liable
to
attack
the
sooner
therefore
the
connection
was
ended
the
better
for
them
and
for
us
by
the
constitutions
which
had
been
conferred
upon
them
australia
and
canada
new
zealand
and
the
cape
were
assumed
to
be
practically
gone
the
same
measures
were
to
be
taken
with
the
west
indies
they
were
not
prosperous
they
formed
no
outlet
for
british
emigration
the
white
population
was
diminishing
they
were
dissatisfied
they
lay
close
to
the
great
american
republic
to
which
geographically
they
more
properly
belonged
representative
assemblies
under
the
crown
had
failed
to
produce
the
content
expected
from
them
or
to
give
an
impulse
to
industry
the
free
negroes
could
not
long
be
excluded
from
the
franchise
the
black
and
white
races
had
not
amalgamated
and
were
not
inclining
to
amalgamate
the
then
recent
gordon
riots
had
been
followed
by
the
suicide
of
the
old
jamaican
constitution
the
government
of
jamaica
had
been
flung
back
upon
the
crown
and
the
crown
was
impatient
of
the
addition
to
its
obligations
the
official
of
whom
i
speak
informed
me
that
a
decision
had
been
irrevocably
taken
the
troops
were
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
islands
and
jamaica
trinidad
and
the
english
antilles
were
to
be
masters
of
their
own
destiny
either
to
form
into
free
communities
like
the
spanish
american
republics
or
to
join
the
united
states
or
to
do
what
they
pleased
with
the
sole
understanding
that
we
were
to
have
no
more
responsibilities
i
do
not
know
how
far
the
scheme
was
matured
to
an
outside
spectator
it
seemed
too
hazardous
to
have
been
seriously
meditated
yet
i
was
told
that
it
had
not
been
meditated
only
but
positively
determined
upon
and
that
further
discussion
of
a
settled
question
would
be
fruitless
and
needlessly
irritating
politicians
with
a
favourite
scheme
are
naturally
sanguine
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
a
west
indian
federation
the
black
race
would
necessarily
be
admitted
to
their
full
rights
as
citizens
their
numbers
enormously
preponderated
and
the
late
scenes
in
jamaica
were
signs
that
the
two
colours
would
not
blend
into
one
that
there
might
be
and
even
inevitably
would
be
collisions
between
them
which
would
lead
to
actions
which
we
could
not
tolerate
the
white
residents
and
the
negroes
had
not
been
drawn
together
by
the
abolition
of
slavery
but
were
further
apart
than
ever
the
whites
if
by
superior
intelligence
they
could
gain
the
upper
hand
would
not
be
allowed
to
keep
it
as
little
would
they
submit
to
be
ruled
by
a
race
whom
they
despised
and
i
thought
it
quite
certain
that
something
would
happen
which
would
compel
the
british
government
to
interfere
again
whether
we
liked
it
or
not
liberty
in
hayti
had
been
followed
by
a
massacre
of
the
french
inhabitants
and
the
french
settlers
had
done
no
worse
than
we
had
done
to
deserve
the
ill
will
of
their
slaves
fortunately
opinion
changed
in
england
before
the
experiment
could
be
tried
the
colonial
policy
of
the
doctrinaire
statesmen
was
no
sooner
understood
than
it
was
universally
condemned
and
they
could
not
press
proposals
on
the
west
indies
which
the
west
indians
showed
so
little
readiness
to
meet
so
things
drifted
on
remaining
to
appearance
as
they
were
the
troops
were
not
recalled
a
minor
confederation
was
formed
in
the
leeward
antilles
the
windward
group
was
placed
under
barbadoes
and
islands
which
before
had
governors
of
their
own
passed
under
subordinate
administrators
local
councils
continued
under
various
conditions
the
popular
element
being
cautiously
and
silently
introduced
the
blacks
settled
into
a
condition
of
peasant
proprietors
but
so
far
as
the
white
or
english
interest
was
concerned
two
causes
which
undermined
west
indian
prosperity
continued
to
operate
so
long
as
sugar
maintained
its
price
the
planters
with
the
help
of
coolie
labour
were
able
to
struggle
on
but
the
beetroot
bounties
came
to
cut
from
under
them
the
industry
in
which
they
had
placed
their
main
dependence
the
reports
were
continually
darker
of
distress
and
rapidly
approaching
ruin
petitions
for
protection
were
not
or
could
not
be
granted
they
were
losing
heart
the
worst
loss
of
all
while
the
home
government
no
longer
with
a
view
to
separation
but
with
the
hope
that
it
might
produce
the
same
effect
which
it
produced
elsewhere
were
still
looking
to
their
old
remedy
of
the
extension
of
the
principle
of
one
serious
step
was
taken
very
recently
towards
the
of
a
constitution
in
jamaica
it
was
assumed
that
it
had
failed
before
because
the
blacks
were
not
properly
represented
the
council
was
again
made
partially
elective
and
the
black
vote
was
admitted
on
the
widest
basis
a
power
was
retained
by
the
crown
of
increasing
in
case
of
necessity
the
nominated
official
members
to
a
number
which
would
counterbalance
the
elected
members
but
the
power
had
not
been
acted
on
and
was
not
perhaps
designed
to
continue
and
a
restless
hope
was
said
to
have
revived
among
the
negroes
that
the
day
was
not
far
off
when
jamaica
would
be
as
hayti
and
they
would
have
the
island
to
themselves
to
a
person
like
myself
to
whom
the
preservation
of
the
british
empire
appeared
to
be
the
only
public
cause
in
which
just
now
it
was
possible
to
feel
concern
the
problem
was
extremely
interesting
i
had
no
prejudice
against
i
had
seen
the
australian
colonies
growing
under
it
in
health
and
strength
with
a
rapidity
which
rivalled
the
progress
of
the
american
union
itself
i
had
observed
in
south
africa
that
the
confusions
and
perplexities
there
diminished
exactly
in
proportion
as
the
home
government
ceased
to
interfere
i
could
not
hope
that
as
an
outsider
i
could
see
my
way
through
difficulties
where
practised
eyes
were
at
a
loss
but
it
was
clear
that
the
west
indies
were
suffering
be
the
cause
what
it
might
i
learnt
that
a
party
had
risen
there
at
last
which
was
actually
in
favour
of
a
union
with
america
and
i
wished
to
find
an
answer
to
a
question
which
i
had
long
asked
myself
to
no
purpose
my
old
friend
motley
was
once
speaking
to
me
of
the
probable
accession
of
canada
to
the
american
republic
i
asked
him
if
he
was
sure
that
canada
would
like
it
it
he
replied
i
like
the
house
of
baring
to
take
me
into
partnership
to
be
a
partner
in
the
british
empire
appeared
to
me
to
be
at
least
as
great
a
thing
as
to
be
a
state
under
the
stars
and
stripes
what
was
it
that
canada
what
was
it
that
any
other
colony
would
gain
by
exchanging
british
citizenship
for
american
citizenship
what
did
america
offer
to
those
who
joined
her
which
we
refused
to
give
or
neglected
to
give
was
it
that
great
britain
did
not
take
her
colonies
into
partnership
at
all
was
it
that
while
in
the
united
states
the
blood
circulated
freely
from
the
heart
to
the
extremities
so
that
one
member
suffered
all
the
body
suffered
with
it
our
colonies
were
simply
as
they
used
to
be
called
offshoots
from
the
old
stock
set
down
as
circumstances
had
dictated
in
various
parts
of
the
globe
but
vitally
detached
and
left
to
grow
or
to
wither
according
to
their
own
inherent
strength
at
one
time
the
west
indian
colonies
had
been
more
to
us
than
such
casual
seedlings
they
had
been
precious
regarded
as
jewels
which
hundreds
of
thousands
of
english
lives
had
been
sacrificed
to
tear
from
france
and
spain
the
caribbean
sea
was
the
cradle
of
the
naval
empire
of
great
britain
there
drake
and
hawkins
intercepted
the
golden
stream
which
flowed
from
panama
into
the
exchequer
at
madrid
and
furnished
philip
with
the
means
to
carry
on
his
war
with
the
reformation
the
pope
had
claimed
to
be
lord
of
the
new
world
as
well
as
of
the
old
and
had
declared
that
spaniards
and
only
spaniards
should
own
territory
or
carry
on
trade
there
within
the
tropics
the
seamen
of
england
took
up
the
challenge
and
replied
with
cannon
shot
it
was
not
the
crown
it
was
not
the
government
which
fought
that
battle
it
was
the
people
of
england
who
fought
it
with
their
own
hands
and
their
own
resources
adventurers
buccaneers
corsairs
privateers
call
them
by
what
name
we
will
stand
as
extraordinary
but
characteristic
figures
on
the
stage
of
history
disowned
or
acknowledged
by
their
sovereign
as
suited
diplomatic
convenience
the
outlawed
pirate
of
one
year
was
promoted
the
next
to
be
a
governor
and
his
country
representative
in
those
waters
the
men
were
formed
and
trained
who
drove
the
armada
through
the
channel
into
wreck
and
ruin
in
those
waters
in
the
centuries
which
followed
france
and
england
fought
for
the
ocean
empire
and
england
won
it
won
it
on
the
day
when
her
own
politicians
hearts
had
failed
them
and
all
the
powers
of
the
world
had
combined
to
humiliate
her
and
rodney
shattered
the
french
fleet
saved
gibraltar
and
avenged
york
town
if
ever
the
naval
exploits
of
this
country
are
done
into
an
epic
poem
and
since
the
iliad
there
has
been
no
subject
better
fitted
for
such
treatment
or
better
deserving
it
the
west
indies
will
be
the
scene
of
the
most
brilliant
cantos
for
england
to
allow
them
to
drift
away
from
her
because
they
have
no
immediate
marketable
value
would
be
a
sign
that
she
had
lost
the
feelings
with
which
great
nations
always
treasure
the
heroic
traditions
of
their
fathers
when
those
traditions
come
to
be
regarded
as
something
which
concerns
them
no
longer
their
greatness
is
already
on

morning
papers
the

past
and
present
the
heavy
weather
the
petrel
the
azores
the
last
week
in
december
when
the
year
was
waning
to
its
close
i
left
waterloo
station
to
join
a
west
indian
mail
steamer
at
southampton
the
air
was
frosty
the
fog
lay
thick
over
city
and
river
the
houses
of
parliament
themselves
were
scarcely
visible
as
i
drove
across
westminster
bridge
in
the
heavy
london
vapour
a
symbol
of
the
cloud
which
was
hanging
over
the
immediate
political
future
the
morning
papers
were
occupied
with
lord
tennyson
new
hall
and
gladstone
remarks
upon
it
i
had
read
neither
but
from
the
criticisms
it
appeared
that
lord
tennyson
fancied
himself
to
have
seen
a
change
pass
over
england
since
his
boyhood
and
a
change
which
was
not
to
his
mind
the
fruit
of
the
new
ideas
which
were
then
rising
from
the
ground
had
ripened
and
the
taste
was
disagreeable
to
him
the
day
which
had
followed
that
sunrise
had
not
been
at
all
and
beautiful
bold
brow
of
freedom
had
proved
to
have
something
of
brass
upon
it
the
and
wont
england
the
england
out
of
which
had
risen
the
men
who
had
won
her
great
position
for
her
was
losing
its
old
characteristics
things
which
in
his
eager
youth
lord
tennyson
had
despised
he
saw
now
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
despising
and
the
new
notions
which
were
to
remake
the
world
were
not
remaking
it
in
a
shape
that
pleased
him
like
goethe
perhaps
he
felt
that
he
was
stumbling
over
the
roots
of
the
tree
which
he
had
helped
to
plant
the
contrast
in
gladstone
article
was
certainly
remarkable
lord
tennyson
saw
in
institutions
which
were
passing
away
the
decay
of
what
in
its
time
had
been
great
and
noble
and
he
saw
little
rising
in
the
place
of
them
which
humanly
could
be
called
improvement
to
gladstone
these
revolutionary
years
had
been
years
of
the
sweeping
off
of
long
intolerable
abuses
and
of
awaking
to
higher
and
truer
perceptions
of
duty
never
according
to
him
in
any
period
of
her
history
had
england
made
more
glorious
progress
never
had
stood
higher
than
at
the
present
moment
in
material
power
and
moral
excellence
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
they
were
the
years
of
his
own
ascendency
metaphysicians
tell
us
that
we
do
not
know
anything
as
it
really
is
what
we
call
outward
objects
are
but
impressions
generated
upon
our
sense
by
forces
of
the
actual
nature
of
which
we
are
totally
ignorant
we
imagine
that
we
hear
a
sound
and
that
the
sound
is
something
real
which
is
outside
us
but
the
sound
is
in
the
ear
and
is
made
by
the
ear
and
the
thing
outside
is
but
a
vibration
of
air
if
no
animal
existed
with
organs
of
hearing
the
vibrations
might
be
as
before
but
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
sound
and
all
our
opinions
on
all
subjects
whatsoever
are
equally
subjective
lord
tennyson
opinions
and
gladstone
opinions
reveal
to
us
only
the
nature
and
texture
of
their
own
minds
which
have
been
affected
in
this
way
or
that
way
the
scale
has
not
been
made
in
which
we
can
weigh
the
periods
in
a
nation
life
or
measure
them
one
against
the
other
the
past
is
gone
and
nothing
but
the
bones
of
it
can
be
recalled
we
but
half
understand
the
present
for
each
age
is
a
chrysalis
and
we
are
ignorant
into
what
it
may
develop
we
do
not
even
try
to
understand
it
honestly
for
we
shut
our
eyes
against
what
we
do
not
wish
to
see
i
will
not
despond
with
lord
tennyson
to
take
a
gloomy
view
of
things
will
not
mend
them
and
modern
enlightenment
may
have
excellent
gifts
in
store
for
us
which
will
come
but
i
will
not
say
that
they
have
come
as
yet
i
will
not
say
that
public
life
is
improved
when
party
spirit
has
degenerated
into
an
organised
civil
war
and
a
civil
war
which
can
never
end
for
it
renews
its
life
like
the
giant
of
fable
at
every
fresh
election
i
will
not
say
that
men
are
more
honest
and
more
when
debts
are
repudiated
and
law
is
defied
in
half
the
country
and
gladstone
himself
applauds
or
refuses
to
condemn
acts
of
open
dishonesty
we
are
to
congratulate
ourselves
that
duelling
has
ceased
but
i
do
not
know
that
men
act
more
honourably
because
they
can
be
called
less
sharply
to
account
we
are
told
has
disappeared
also
but
the
wrecker
scuttles
his
ship
or
runs
it
ashore
to
cheat
the
insurance
office
the
church
may
perhaps
be
improved
in
the
arrangement
of
the
services
and
in
the
professional
demonstrativeness
of
the
clergy
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
clergy
have
more
influence
over
the
minds
of
men
than
they
had
fifty
years
ago
or
that
the
doctrines
which
the
church
teaches
are
more
powerful
over
public
opinion
one
would
not
gather
that
our
morality
was
so
superior
from
the
reports
which
we
see
in
the
newspapers
and
girls
now
talk
over
novels
which
the
ladies
maids
of
their
grandmothers
might
have
read
in
secret
but
would
have
blushed
while
reading
each
age
would
do
better
if
it
studied
its
own
faults
and
endeavoured
to
mend
them
instead
of
comparing
itself
with
others
to
its
own
advantage
this
only
was
clear
to
me
in
thinking
over
what
gladstone
was
reported
to
have
said
and
in
thinking
of
his
own
achievements
and
career
that
there
are
two
classes
of
men
who
have
played
and
still
play
a
prominent
part
in
the
world
those
who
accomplish
great
things
and
those
who
talk
and
make
speeches
about
them
the
doers
of
things
are
for
the
most
part
silent
those
who
build
up
empires
or
discover
secrets
of
science
those
who
paint
great
pictures
or
write
great
poems
are
not
often
to
be
found
spouting
upon
platforms
the
silent
men
do
the
work
the
talking
men
cry
out
at
what
is
done
because
it
is
not
done
as
they
would
have
had
it
and
afterwards
take
possession
of
it
as
if
it
was
their
own
property

for
us
the
eloquent
burke
desires
and
passionately
tries
to
hang
him
for
it
at
the
supreme
crisis
in
our
history
when
america
had
revolted
and
ireland
was
defiant
when
the
great
powers
of
europe
had
coalesced
to
crush
us
and
we
were
staggering
under
the
disaster
at
york
town
rodney
struck
a
blow
in
the
west
indies
which
sounded
over
the
world
and
saved
for
britain
her
ocean
sceptre
just
in
time
for
the
popular
leaders
had
persuaded
the
house
of
commons
that
rodney
ought
to
be
recalled
and
peace
made
on
any
terms
even
in
politics
the
names
of
oratorical
statesmen
are
rarely
associated
with
the
organic
growth
of
enduring
institutions
the
most
distinguished
of
them
have
been
conspicuous
only
as
instruments
of
destruction
institutions
are
the
slow
growths
of
centuries
the
orator
cuts
them
down
in
a
day
the
tree
falls
and
the
hand
that
wields
the
axe
is
admired
and
applauded
the
speeches
of
demosthenes
and
cicero
pass
into
literature
and
are
studied
as
models
of
language
but
demosthenes
and
cicero
did
not
understand
the
facts
of
their
time
their
language
might
be
beautiful
and
their
sentiments
noble
but
with
their
fine
words
and
sentiments
they
only
misled
their
countrymen
the
periods
where
the
orator
is
supreme
are
marked
always
by
confusion
and
disintegration
goethe
could
say
of
luther
that
he
had
thrown
back
for
centuries
the
spiritual
cultivation
of
mankind
by
calling
the
passions
of
the
multitude
to
judge
of
matters
which
should
have
been
left
to
the
thinkers
we
ourselves
are
just
now
in
one
of
those
uneasy
periods
and
we
have
decided
that
orators
are
the
fittest
people
to
rule
over
us
the
constituencies
choose
their
members
according
to
the
fluency
of
their
tongues
can
he
make
a
speech
is
the
one
test
of
competency
for
a
legislator
and
the
most
persuasive
of
the
whole
we
make
prime
minister
we
admire
the
man
for
his
gifts
and
we
accept
what
he
says
for
the
manner
in
which
it
is
uttered
he
may
contradict
what
he
asserted
yesterday
no
matter
he
can
persuade
others
wherever
he
is
persuaded
himself
and
such
is
the
nature
of
him
that
he
can
convince
himself
of
anything
which
it
is
his
interest
to
believe
these
are
the
persons
who
are
now
regarded
as
our
wisest
it
was
not
always
so
it
is
not
so
now
with
nations
who
are
in
a
sound
state
of
health
the
americans
when
they
choose
a
president
or
a
secretary
of
state
or
any
functionary
from
whom
they
require
wise
action
do
not
select
these
famous
such
periods
do
not
last
for
the
condition
which
they
bring
about
becomes
always
intolerable
i
do
not
believe
in
the
degeneracy
of
our
race
i
believe
the
present
generation
of
englishmen
to
be
capable
of
all
that
their
fathers
were
and
possibly
of
more
but
we
are
just
now
in
a
moulting
state
and
are
sick
while
the
process
is
going
on
or
to
take
another
metaphor
the
bow
of
ulysses
is
unstrung
the
worms
have
not
eaten
into
the
horn
or
the
moths
injured
the
string
but
the
owner
of
the
house
is
away
and
the
suitors
of
penelope
britannia
consume
her
substance
rivals
one
of
another
each
caring
only
for
himself
but
with
a
common
heart
in
evil
they
can
not
string
the
bow
only
the
true
lord
and
master
can
string
it
and
in
due
time
he
comes
and
the
cord
is
stretched
once
more
upon
the
notch
singing
to
the
touch
of
the
finger
with
the
sharp
note
of
the
swallow
and
the
arrows
fly
to
their
mark
in
the
breasts
of
the
pretenders
while
pallas
athene
looks
on
approving
from
her
coign
of
vantage
random
meditations
of
this
kind
were
sent
flying
through
me
by
the
newspaper
articles
on
tennyson
and
gladstone
the
air
cleared
and
my
mind
also
as
we
ran
beyond
the
smoke
the
fields
were
covered
deep
with
snow
a
white
vapour
clung
along
the
ground
the
winter
sky
shining
through
it
soft
and
blue
the
ponds
and
canals
were
hard
frozen
and
men
were
skating
and
boys
were
sliding
and
all
was
brilliant
and
beautiful
the
ladies
of
the
forest
the
birch
trees
beside
the
line
about
farnborough
were
hung
with
jewels
of
ice
and
glittered
like
a
fretwork
of
purple
and
silver
it
was
like
escaping
out
of
a
nightmare
into
happy
healthy
england
once
more
in
the
carriage
with
me
were
several
gentlemen
officers
going
out
to
join
their
regiments
planters
who
had
been
at
home
on
business
young
sportsmen
with
rifles
and
cartridge
cases
who
were
hoping
to
shoot
alligators
all
bound
like
myself
for
the
west
indian
mail
steamer
the
elders
talked
of
sugar
and
of
bounties
and
of
the
financial
ruin
of
the
islands
i
had
heard
of
this
before
i
started
and
i
learnt
little
from
them
which
i
had
not
known
already
but
i
had
misgivings
whether
i
was
not
wandering
off
after
all
on
a
fool
errand
i
did
not
want
to
shoot
alligators
i
did
not
understand
cane
growing
or
want
to
understand
it
nor
was
i
likely
to
find
a
remedy
for
encumbered
and
bankrupt
landowners
i
was
at
an
age
too
when
men
grow
unfit
for
roaming
and
are
expected
to
stay
quietly
at
home
plato
says
that
to
travel
to
any
profit
one
should
go
between
fifty
and
sixty
not
sooner
because
one
has
one
duties
to
attend
to
as
a
citizen
not
after
because
the
mind
becomes
hebetated
the
chief
object
of
going
abroad
in
plato
opinion
is
to
converse
with
greek
theioi
andres
inspired
men
whom
providence
scatters
about
the
globe
and
from
whom
alone
wisdom
can
be
learnt
and
i
alas
was
long
past
the
limit
and
greek
theioi
andres
are
not
to
be
met
with
in
these
times
but
if
not
with
inspired
men
i
might
fall
in
at
any
rate
with
sensible
men
who
would
talk
on
things
which
i
wanted
to
know
winter
and
spring
in
a
warm
climate
were
pleasanter
than
a
winter
and
spring
at
home
and
as
there
is
compensation
in
all
things
old
people
can
see
some
objects
more
clearly
than
young
people
can
see
them
they
have
no
interest
of
their
own
to
mislead
their
perception
they
have
lived
too
long
to
believe
in
any
formulas
or
theories
age
the
greek
poet
says
not
wholly
a
misfortune
experience
teaches
things
which
the
young
know
not
old
men
at
any
rate
like
to
think
so
the
in
which
i
had
taken
my
passage
was
a
large
steamer
of
tons
one
of
the
best
where
all
are
good
on
the
west
indian
mail
line
her
long
straight
sides
and
rounded
bottom
promised
that
she
would
roll
and
i
may
say
that
the
promise
was
faithfully
kept
but
except
to
the
stomachs
of
the
inexperienced
rolling
is
no
disadvantage
a
vessel
takes
less
water
on
board
in
a
beam
sea
when
she
yields
to
the
wave
than
when
she
stands
up
stiff
and
straight
against
it
the
deck
when
i
went
on
board
was
slippery
with
ice
there
was
the
usual
crowd
and
confusion
before
departure
those
who
were
going
out
being
undistinguishable
till
the
bell
rang
to
clear
the
ship
from
the
friends
who
had
accompanied
them
to
take
leave
i
discovered
however
to
my
satisfaction
that
our
party
in
the
cabin
would
not
be
a
large
one
the
west
indians
who
had
come
over
for
the
colonial
exhibition
were
most
of
them
already
gone
they
along
with
the
rest
had
taken
back
with
them
a
consciousness
that
their
visit
had
not
been
wholly
in
vain
and
that
the
interest
of
the
old
country
in
her
distant
possessions
seemed
quickening
into
life
once
more
the
commissioners
from
all
our
dependencies
had
been
fêted
in
the
great
towns
and
the
people
had
come
to
kensington
in
millions
to
admire
the
productions
which
bore
witness
to
the
boundless
resources
of
british
territory
had
it
been
only
a
passing
emotion
of
wonder
and
pride
or
was
it
a
prelude
to
a
more
energetic
policy
and
active
resolution
anyway
it
was
something
to
be
glad
of
receptions
and
public
dinners
and
loyal
speeches
will
not
solve
political
problems
but
they
create
the
feeling
of
good
will
which
underlies
the
useful
consideration
of
them
the
exhibition
had
served
the
purpose
which
it
was
intended
for
the
conference
of
delegates
grew
out
of
it
which
has
discussed
in
the
happiest
temper
the
elements
of
our
future
relations
but
the
exhibition
doors
were
now
closed
and
the
multitude
of
admirers
or
contributors
were
dispersed
or
dispersing
to
their
homes
in
the
we
had
only
the
latest
lingerers
or
the
ordinary
passengers
who
went
to
and
fro
on
business
or
pleasure
i
observed
them
with
the
curiosity
with
which
one
studies
persons
with
whom
one
is
to
be
shut
up
for
weeks
in
involuntary
intimacy
one
young
demerara
planter
attracted
my
notice
as
he
had
with
him
a
newly
married
and
beautiful
wife
whose
fresh
complexion
would
so
soon
fade
as
it
always
does
in
those
lands
where
nature
is
brilliant
with
colour
and
english
cheeks
grow
pale
i
found
also
to
my
surprise
and
pleasure
a
daughter
of
one
of
my
oldest
and
dearest
friends
who
was
going
out
to
join
her
husband
in
trinidad
this
was
a
happy
accident
to
start
with
an
announcement
printed
in
spanish
in
large
letters
in
a
conspicuous
position
intimated
that
i
must
be
prepared
for
habits
in
some
of
our
companions
of
a
less
agreeable
kind
suplica
á
los
señores
pasajeros
de
no
escupir
sobre
la
cubierta
de
popa
i
may
as
well
leave
the
words
untranslated
but
the
is
not
unnecessary
the
spanish
colonists
like
their
countrymen
at
home
smoke
everywhere
with
the
usual
consequences
the
captain
of
one
of
our
mail
boats
found
it
necessary
to
read
one
of
them
who
disregarded
it
a
lesson
which
he
would
remember
he
sent
for
the
quartermaster
with
a
bucket
and
a
mop
and
ordered
him
to
stay
by
this
gentleman
and
clean
up
till
he
had
done
the
wind
when
we
started
was
light
and
keen
from
the
north
the
afternoon
sky
was
clear
and
frosty
southampton
water
was
still
as
oil
and
the
sun
went
down
crimson
behind
the
brown
woods
of
the
new
forest
of
the
speed
we
had
instant
evidence
for
a
fast
government
launch
raced
us
for
a
mile
or
two
and
off
netley
gave
up
the
chase
we
went
leisurely
along
doing
thirteen
knots
without
effort
swept
by
calshot
into
the
solent
and
had
cleared
the
needles
before
the
last
daylight
had
left
us
in
a
few
days
the
ice
would
be
gone
and
we
should
lie
in
the
soft
air
of
perennial
summer
singula
de
nobis
anni
prædantur
euntes
eripuere
jocos
venerem
convivia
ludum
but
the
flying
years
had
not
stolen
from
me
the
delight
of
finding
myself
once
more
upon
the
sea
the
sea
which
is
eternally
young
and
gives
one
back
one
own
youth
and
buoyancy
down
the
channel
the
north
wind
still
blew
and
the
water
was
still
smooth
we
set
our
canvas
at
the
needles
and
flew
on
for
three
days
straight
upon
our
course
with
a
steady
breeze
we
crossed
without
the
fiddles
on
the
dinner
table
we
were
congratulating
ourselves
that
as
it
was
we
should
reach
the
tropics
and
never
need
them
i
meanwhile
made
acquaintances
among
my
west
indian
and
listened
to
their
tale
of
grievances
the
exhibition
had
been
well
enough
in
its
way
but
exhibitions
would
not
fill
an
empty
exchequer
or
restore
ruined
plantations
the
mother
country
i
found
was
still
regarded
as
a
stepmother
and
from
more
than
one
quarter
i
heard
a
more
than
muttered
wish
that
they
could
be
into
partnership
by
the
americans
they
were
wasting
away
under
free
trade
and
the
sugar
bounties
the
mother
country
gave
them
fine
words
but
words
were
all
if
they
belonged
to
the
united
states
they
would
have
the
benefit
of
a
close
market
in
a
country
where
there
were
sugar
drinkers
energetic
americans
would
come
among
them
and
establish
new
industries
and
would
control
the
unmanageable
negroes
from
the
most
loyal
i
heard
the
despairing
cry
of
the
britons
barbarians
drive
us
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
drives
us
back
upon
the
barbarians
they
could
bear
free
trade
which
was
fair
all
round
but
not
free
trade
which
was
made
into
a
mockery
by
bounties
and
it
seemed
that
their
masters
in
downing
street
answered
them
as
the
romans
answered
our
forefathers
have
many
colonies
and
we
shall
not
miss
britain
britain
is
far
off
and
must
take
care
of
herself
she
brings
us
responsibility
and
she
brings
us
no
revenue
we
can
not
tax
italy
for
the
sake
of
britons
we
have
given
them
our
arms
and
our
civilisation
we
have
done
enough
let
them
do
now
what
they
can
or
please
virtually
this
is
what
england
says
to
the
west
indians
or
would
say
if
despair
made
them
actively
troublesome
notwithstanding
exhibitions
and
expansive
sentiments
the
answer
from
rome
we
can
now
see
was
the
voice
of
dying
greatness
which
was
no
longer
worthy
of
the
place
in
the
world
which
it
had
made
for
itself
in
the
days
of
its
strength
but
it
doubtless
seemed
reasonable
enough
at
the
time
and
indeed
was
the
only
answer
which
the
rome
of
honorius
could
give
a
change
in
the
weather
cut
short
our
conversations
and
drove
half
the
company
to
their
berths
on
the
fourth
morning
the
wind
chopped
back
to
the
a
beam
sea
set
in
and
the
justified
my
conjectures
about
her
she
rolled
gunwale
under
rolled
at
least
forty
degrees
each
way
and
unshipped
a
boat
out
of
her
davits
to
windward
the
waves
were
not
as
high
as
i
have
known
the
atlantic
produce
when
in
the
humour
for
it
but
they
were
short
steep
and
curling
tons
of
water
poured
over
the
deck
the
few
of
us
who
ventured
below
to
dinner
were
hit
by
the
dumb
waiters
which
swung
over
our
heads
and
the
living
waiters
staggered
about
with
the
dishes
and
upset
the
soup
into
our
laps
everybody
was
grumbling
and
miserable
driven
to
my
cabin
i
was
dozing
on
a
sofa
when
i
was
jerked
off
and
dropped
upon
the
floor
the
noise
down
below
on
these
occasions
is
considerable
the
steering
chains
clank
unfastened
doors
slam
to
and
fro
plates
and
dishes
and
glass
fall
crashing
at
some
lurch
which
is
heavier
than
usual
with
the
roar
of
the
sea
underneath
as
a
constant
accompaniment
when
a
wave
strikes
the
ship
full
on
the
quarter
and
she
staggers
from
stem
to
stern
one
wonders
how
any
construction
of
wood
and
iron
can
endure
such
blows
without
being
shattered
to
fragments
and
it
would
be
shattered
as
i
heard
an
engineer
once
say
if
the
sea
was
not
such
a
gentle
creature
after
all
i
crept
up
to
the
deck
house
to
watch
through
the
lee
door
the
wild
magnificence
of
the
storm
down
came
a
great
green
wave
rushed
in
a
flood
over
everything
and
swept
me
drenched
to
the
skin
down
the
stairs
into
the
cabin
i
crawled
to
bed
to
escape
cold
and
slid
up
and
down
my
berth
like
a
shuttle
at
every
roll
of
the
ship
till
i
fell
into
the
unconsciousness
which
is
a
substitute
for
sleep
slept
at
last
really
and
woke
at
seven
in
the
morning
to
find
the
sun
shining
and
the
surface
of
the
ocean
still
undulating
but
glassy
calm
the
only
signs
left
of
the
tempest
were
the
petrels
skimming
to
and
fro
in
our
wake
picking
up
the
scraps
of
food
and
the
plate
washings
which
the
cook
mate
had
thrown
overboard
smallest
and
beautifullest
of
all
the
gull
tribe
called
petrel
by
our
ancestors
who
went
to
their

stoop
upon

we
passed

of

went

it

through
a

day
alone
against
a

died
there
and

the

of

another

the

behind

our

being
taken
off
from

of

there
was
scarcely

enough
to

the

went
down

into
perpetual

the

lay
about

in
their

reading
story
books
the
young
ones
played
bull
the
officers
flirted
mildly
with
the
pretty
young
ladies
for
a
brief
interval
care
and
anxiety
had
spread
their
wings
and
flown
away
and
existence
itself
became
delightful
there
was
a
young
scientific
man
on
board
who
interested
me
much
he
had
been
sent
out
from
kew
to
take
charge
of
the
botanical
gardens
in
jamaica
was
quiet
modest
and
unaffected
understood
his
own
subjects
well
and
could
make
others
understand
them
with
him
i
had
much
agreeable
conversation
and
there
was
another
singular
person
who
attracted
me
even
more
i
took
him
at
first
for
an
american
he
was
a
dane
i
found
an
engineer
by
profession
and
was
on
his
way
to
some
south
american
republic
he
was
a
long
lean
man
with
grey
eyes
red
hair
and
a
laugh
as
if
he
so
enjoyed
the
thing
that
amused
him
that
he
wished
to
keep
it
all
to
himself
laughing
inwardly
till
he
choked
and
shook
with
it
his
chief
amusement
seemed
to
have
lain
in
watching
the
performances
of
liberal
politicians
in
various
parts
of
the
world
he
told
me
of
an
opposition
leader
in
some
parliament
whom
his
rival
in
office
had
disposed
of
by
shutting
him
up
in
the
caboose
the
caboose
he
repeated
screaming
with
enjoyment
at
the
thought
of
it
and
evidently
wishing
that
all
the
parliamentary
orators
on
the
globe
were
in
the
same
place
in
his
wanderings
he
had
been
lately
at
the
darien
canal
and
gave
me
a
wonderful
account
of
the
condition
of
things
there
the
original
estimate
of
the
probable
cost
had
been
millions
of
our
english
money
all
these
millions
had
been
spent
already
and
only
a
fifth
of
the
whole
had
as
yet
been
executed
the
entire
cost
would
not
be
less
under
the
existing
management
than
one
hundred
millions
and
he
evidently
doubted
whether
the
canal
would
ever
be
completed
at
all
though
professionally
he
would
not
confess
to
such
an
opinion
the
waste
and
plunder
had
been
incalculable
the
works
and
the
gold
that
were
set
moving
by
them
made
a
feast
for
unclean
harpies
of
both
sexes
from
every
nation
in
the
four
continents
i
liked
everything
about
tom
cringle
might
have
been
something
like
him
had
not
evil
genius
driven
him
into
more
dangerous
ways
there
was
a
small
black
boy
among
us
evidently
of
pure
blood
for
his
hair
was
wool
and
his
colour
black
as
ink
his
parents
must
have
been
for
the
boy
had
been
in
europe
to
be
educated
the
officers
on
board
and
some
of
the
ladies
played
with
him
as
they
would
play
with
a
monkey
he
had
little
more
sense
than
a
monkey
perhaps
less
and
the
gestures
of
him
grinning
behind
gratings
and
pushing
out
his
long
thin
arms
between
the
bars
were
curiously
suggestive
of
the
original
from
whom
we
are
told
now
that
all
of
us
came
the
worst
of
it
was
that
being
lifted
above
his
own
people
he
had
been
taught
to
despise
them
he
was
spoilt
as
a
black
and
could
not
be
made
into
a
white
and
this
i
found
afterwards
was
the
invariable
and
dangerous
consequence
whenever
a
superior
negro
contrived
to
raise
himself
he
might
do
well
enough
himself
but
his
family
feel
their
blood
as
a
degradation
his
children
will
not
marry
among
their
own
people
and
not
only
will
no
white
girl
marry
a
negro
but
hardly
any
dowry
can
be
large
enough
to
tempt
a
west
indian
white
to
make
a
wife
of
a
black
lady
this
is
one
of
the
most
sinister
features
in
the
present
state
of
social
life
there
small
personalities
cropped
up
now
and
then
we
had
representatives
of
all
professions
among
us
except
the
church
of
england
clergy
of
them
we
had
not
one
the
captain
as
usual
read
us
the
service
on
sundays
on
a
cushion
for
a
desk
with
the
union
jack
spread
over
it
on
board
ship
the
captain
like
a
sovereign
is
supreme
and
in
spiritual
matters
as
in
secular
drake
was
the
first
commander
who
carried
the
theory
into
practice
when
he
excommunicated
his
chaplain
it
is
the
law
now
and
the
tradition
has
gone
on
unbroken
in
default
of
clergy
we
had
a
missionary
who
for
the
most
part
kept
his
lips
closed
he
did
open
them
once
and
at
my
expense
apropos
of
nothing
he
said
to
me
wonder
sir
whether
you
ever
read
the
remarks
upon
you
in
the
newspapers
if
all
the
attacks
upon
your
writings
which
i
have
seen
were
collected
together
they
would
make
an
interesting
volume
this
was
all
he
had
delivered
his
soul
and
relapsed
into
silence
from
a
puerto
rico
merchant
i
learnt
that
if
the
english
colonies
were
in
a
bad
way
the
spanish
colonies
were
in
a
worse
his
own
island
he
said
was
a
nest
of
squalor
misery
vice
and
disease
blacks
and
whites
were
equally
immoral
and
so
far
as
habits
went
the
whites
were
the
filthier
of
the
two
the
complaints
of
the
english
west
indians
were
less
sweeping
and
as
to
immorality
between
whites
and
blacks
neither
from
my
companions
in
the
nor
anywhere
afterward
did
i
hear
or
see
a
sign
of
it
the
profligacy
of
planter
life
passed
away
with
slavery
and
the
changed
condition
of
the
two
races
makes
impossible
any
return
to
the
old
habits
but
they
had
wrongs
of
their
own
and
were
eloquent
in
their
exposition
of
them
we
had
taken
the
islands
from
france
and
spain
at
an
enormous
expense
and
we
were
throwing
them
aside
like
a
child
toy
we
did
nothing
for
them
we
allowed
them
no
advantage
as
british
subjects
and
when
they
tried
to
do
something
for
themselves
we
interposed
with
an
imperial
veto
the
united
states
seeing
the
west
indian
trade
gravitating
towards
new
york
had
offered
them
a
commercial
treaty
being
willing
to
admit
their
sugar
duty
free
in
consideration
of
the
islands
admitting
in
return
their
salt
fish
and
flour
and
notions
a
treaty
was
in
process
of
negotiation
between
the
united
states
and
the
spanish
islands
a
similar
treaty
had
been
freely
offered
to
them
which
might
have
saved
them
from
ruin
and
the
imperial
government
had
disallowed
it
how
under
such
treatment
could
we
expect
them
to
be
loyal
to
the
british
connection
it
was
a
relief
to
turn
back
from
these
lamentations
to
the
brilliant
period
of
past
west
indian
history
with
the
planters
of
the
present
it
was
all
sugar
and
the
lazy
blacks
who
were
england
darlings
and
would
not
work
for
them
the
handbooks
were
equally
barren
in
them
i
found
nothing
but
modern
statistics
pointing
to
dreary
conclusions
and
in
the
place
of
any
human
interest
long
stories
of
constitutions
suffrages
representative
assemblies
powers
of
elected
members
and
powers
reserved
to
the
crown
such
things
important
as
they
might
be
did
not
touch
my
imagination
and
to
an
englishman
proud
of
his
country
the
west
indies
had
a
far
higher
interest
strange
scenes
streamed
across
my
memory
and
a
shadowy
procession
of
great
figures
who
have
printed
their
names
in
history
columbus
and
cortez
vasco
nuñez
and
las
casas
the
millions
of
innocent
indians
who
according
to
las
casas
were
destroyed
out
of
the
islands
the
spanish
grinding
them
to
death
in
their
gold
mines
the
black
swarms
who
were
poured
in
to
take
their
place
and
the
frightful
story
of
the
slave
trade
behind
it
all
was
the
european
drama
of
the
sixteenth
century
charles
and
philip
fighting
against
the
genius
of
the
new
era
and
feeding
their
armies
with
the
ingots
of
the
new
world
the
convulsion
spread
across
the
atlantic
the
english
protestants
and
the
french
huguenots
took
to
sea
like
water
dogs
and
challenged
their
enemies
in
their
own
special
domain
to
the
popes
and
the
spaniards
the
new
world
was
the
property
of
the
church
and
of
those
who
had
discovered
it
a
papal
bull
bestowed
on
spain
all
the
countries
which
lay
within
the
tropics
west
of
the
atlantic
a
form
of
monroe
doctrine
not
unreasonable
as
long
as
there
was
force
to
maintain
it
but
the
force
was
indispensable
and
the
protestant
adventurers
tried
the
question
with
them
at
the
mouth
they
were
of
the
reformed
faith
all
of
them
these
sea
rovers
of
the
early
days
and
like
their
enemies
they
were
of
a
very
mixed
complexion
the
spaniards
gorged
with
plunder
and
wading
in
blood
were
at
the
same
time
and
in
their
own
eyes
crusading
soldiers
of
the
faith
missionaries
of
the
holy
church
and
defenders
of
the
doctrines
which
were
impiously
assailed
in
europe
the
privateers
from
plymouth
and
rochelle
paid
also
for
the
cost
of
their
expeditions
with
the
pillage
of
ships
and
towns
and
the
profits
of
the
slave
trade
and
they
too
were
the
unlicensed
champions
of
spiritual
freedom
in
their
own
estimate
of
themselves
the
gold
which
was
meant
for
alva
troops
in
flanders
found
its
way
into
the
treasure
houses
of
the
london
companies
the
logs
of
the
voyages
of
the
elizabethan
navigators
represent
them
faithfully
as
they
were
freebooters
of
the
ocean
in
one
aspect
of
them
in
another
the
sea
warriors
of
the
reformation
uncommissioned
unrecognised
fighting
on
their
own
responsibility
liable
to
be
disowned
when
they
failed
while
the
queen
herself
would
privately
be
a
shareholder
in
the
adventure
it
was
a
wild
anarchic
scene
fit
cradle
of
the
spiritual
freedom
of
a
new
age
when
the
nations
of
the
earth
were
breaking
the
chains
in
which
king
and
priest
had
bound
them
to
the
spaniards
drake
and
his
comrades
were
robbers
enemies
of
the
human
race
to
be
treated
to
a
short
shrift
whenever
found
and
caught
british
seamen
who
fell
into
their
hands
were
carried
before
the
inquisition
at
lima
or
carthagena
and
burnt
at
the
stake
as
heretics
four
of
drake
crew
were
unfortunately
taken
once
at
vera
cruz
drake
sent
a
message
to
the
that
if
a
hair
of
their
heads
was
singed
he
would
hang
ten
spaniards
for
each
one
of
them
this
curious
note
is
at
simancas
where
i
saw
it
so
great
an
object
of
terror
at
madrid
was
el
draque
that
he
was
looked
on
as
an
incarnation
of
the
old
serpent
and
when
he
failed
in
his
last
enterprise
and
news
came
that
he
was
dead

a
hymn
of
triumph
in
an
epic
poem
which
he
called

when
elizabeth
died
and
peace
was
made
with
spain
the
adventurers
lost
something
of
the
indirect
countenance
which
had
so
far
been
extended
to
them
the
execution
of
raleigh
being
one
among
other
marks
of
the
change
of
mind
but
they
continued
under
other
names
and
no
active
effort
was
made
to
suppress
them
the
spanish
government
did
in
agree
to
leave
england
in
possession
of
barbadoes
but
the
pretensions
to
an
exclusive
right
to
trade
continued
to
be
maintained
and
the
english
and
french
refused
to
recognise
it
the
french
privateers
seized
tortuga
an
island
off
domingo
and
they
and
their
english
friends
swarmed
in
the
caribbean
sea
as
buccaneers
or
flibustiers
they
exchanged
names
perhaps
as
a
symbol
of
their
alliance
was
english
and
a
corruption
of
freebooter
came
from
the
boucan
or
dried
beef
of
the
wild
cattle
which
the
french
hunters
shot
in
española
and
which
formed
the
chief
of
their
sea
stores
boucan
became
a
french
verb
and
according
to

itself
the

had
originally
drawn

together
cooled
by
degrees
as
french
catholics
as
well
as

took
to
the
trade
port
royal
became
the
headquarters
of
the
english
buccaneers
the
last
and
greatest
of
them
being
henry
morgan
who
took
and
plundered
panama
was
knighted
for
his
services
and
was
afterwards
made
of
jamaica
from
the
time
when
the
spaniards
threw
open
their
trade
and
english
seamen
ceased
to
be
delivered
over
to
the
inquisition
the
english
buccaneers
ceased
to
be
respectable
characters
and
gradually
drifted
into
the
pirates
of
later
history
when
under
their
new
conditions
they
produced
their
more
questionable
heroes
the
kidds
and
blackbeards
the
french
flibustiers
continued
long
after
far
into
the
eighteenth
century
some
of
them
with
commissions
as
privateers
others
as
or
unlicensed
rovers
but
still
connived
at
in
martinique
adventurers
buccaneers
pirates
pass
across
the
stage
the
curtain
falls
on
them
and
rises
on
a
more
glorious
scene
jamaica
had
become
the
depôt
of
the
trade
of
england
with
the
western
world
and
golden
streams
had
poured
into
port
royal
barbadoes
was
unoccupied
when
england
took
possession
of
it
and
never
passed
out
of
our
hands
but
the
antilles
the
anterior
isles
which
stand
like
a
string
of
emeralds
round
the
neck
of
the
caribbean
sea
had
been
most
of
them
colonised
and
occupied
by
the
french
and
during
the
wars
of
the
last
century
were
the
objects
of
a
never
ceasing
conflict
between
their
fleets
and
ours
the
french
had
planted
their
language
there
they
had
planted
their
religion
there
and
the
blacks
of
these
islands
generally
still
speak
the
french
patois
and
call
themselves
catholics
but
it
was
deemed
essential
to
our
interests
that
the
antilles
should
be
not
french
but
english
and
antigua
martinique
lucia
vincent
and
grenada
were
taken
and
retaken
and
taken
again
in

struggle
perpetually
renewed
when

revolted

west

became
involved
in
the
revolutionary
hurricane
france
spain
and
holland
our
three
ocean
rivals
combined
in
a
supreme
effort
to
tear
from
us
our
imperial
power
the
opportunity
was
seized
by
irish
patriots
to
clamour
for
irish
nationality
and
by
the
english
radicals
to
demand
liberty
and
the
rights
of
man
it
was
the
most
critical
moment
in
later
english
history
if
we
had
yielded
to
peace
on
the
terms
which
our
enemies
offered
and
the
english
liberals
wished
us
to
accept
the
star
of
great
britain
would
have
set
for
ever
the
west
indies
were
then
under
the
charge
of
rodney
whose
brilliant
successes
had
already
made
his
name
famous
he
had
done
his
country
more
than
yeoman
service
he
had
torn
the
leeward
islands
from
the
french
he
had
punished
the
hollanders
for
joining
the
coalition
by
taking
the
island
of
eustachius
and
three
millions
worth
of
stores
and
money
the
patriot
party
at
home
led
by
fox
and
burke
were
ill
pleased
with
these
victories
for
they
wished
us
to
be
driven
into
surrender
burke
denounced
rodney
as
he
denounced
warren
hastings
and
rodney
was
called
home
to
answer
for
himself
in
his
absence
demerara
the
leeward
islands
eustachius
itself
were
captured
or
recovered
by
the
enemy
the
french
fleet
now
supreme
in
the
western
waters
blockaded
lord
cornwallis
at
york
town
and
forced
him
to
capitulate
the
spaniards
had
fitted
out
a
fleet
at
havannah
and
the
count
de
grasse
the
french
admiral
fresh
from
the
victorious
thunder
of
the
american
cannon
hastened
back
to
refurnish
himself
at
martinique
intending
to
join
the
spaniards
tear
jamaica
from
us
and
drive
us
finally
and
completely
out
of
the
west
indies
one
chance
remained
rodney
was
ordered
back
to
his
station
and
he
went
at
his
best
speed
taking
all
the
ships
with
him
which
could
then
be
spared
it
was
he
forced
his
way
to
barbadoes
in
five
weeks
spite
of
equinoctial
storms
the
whig
orators
were
indignant
they
insisted
that
we
were
beaten
there
had
been
bloodshed
enough
and
we
must
sit
down
in
our
humiliation
the
government
yielded
and
a
peremptory
order
followed
on
rodney
track
your
flag
and
come
home
had
that
fatal
command
reached
him
gibraltar
would
have
fallen
and
hastings
indian
empire
would
have
melted
into
air
but
rodney
knew
that
his
time
was
short
and
he
had
been
prompt
to
use
it
before
the
order
came
the
severest
naval
battle
in
english
annals
had
been
fought
and
won
de
grasse
was
a
prisoner
and
the
french
fleet
was
scattered
into
wreck
and
ruin
de
grasse
had
refitted
in
the
martinique
dockyards
he
himself
and
every
officer
in
the
fleet
was
confident
that
england
was
at
last
done
for
and
that
nothing
was
left
but
to
gather
the
fruits
of
the
victory
which
was
theirs
already
not
xerxes
when
he
broke
through
thermopylae
and
watched
from
the
shore
his
thousand
galleys
streaming
down
to
the
gulf
of
salamis
was
more
assured
that
his
prize
was
in
his
hands
than
de
grasse
on
the
deck
of
the
de
paris
the
finest
ship
then
floating
on
the
seas
when
he
heard
that
rodney
was
at
lucia
and
intended
to
engage
him
he
did
not
even
believe
that
the
english
after
so
many
reverses
would
venture
to
meddle
with
a
fleet
superior
in
force
and
inspirited
with
victory
all
the
antilles
except
lucia
were
his
own
tobago
grenada
the
grenadines
vincent
martinique
dominica
guadaloupe
montserrat
nevis
antigua
and
kitts
he
held
them
all
in
proud
possession
a
string
of
gems
each
island
large
as
or
larger
than
the
isle
of
man
rising
up
with
high
volcanic
peaks
clothed
from
base
to
crest
with
forest
carved
into
deep
ravines
and
fringed
with
luxuriant
plains
in
lucia
alone
lying
between
vincent
and
dominica
the
english
flag
still
flew
and
rodney
lay
there
in
the
harbour
at
castries
on
april
the
signal
came
from
the
north
end
of
the
island
that
the
french
fleet
had
sailed
martinique
is
in
sight
of
lucia
and
the
rock
is
still
shown
from
which
rodney
had
watched
day
by
day
for
signs
that
they
were
moving
they
were
out
at
last
and
he
instantly
weighed
and
followed
the
air
was
light
and
de
grasse
was
under
the
high
lands
of
dominica
before
rodney
came
up
with
him
both
fleets
were
becalmed
and
the
english
were
scattered
and
divided
by
a
current
which
runs
between
the
islands
a
breeze
at
last
blew
off
the
land
the
french
were
the
first
to
feel
it
and
were
able
to
attack
at
advantage
the
leading
english
division
had
de
grasse
down
as
he
ought
rodney
thought
that
the
consequences
might
have
been
serious
in
careless
imagination
of
superiority
they
let
the
chance
go
by
they
kept
at
a
distance
firing
long
shots
which
as
it
was
did
considerable
damage
the
two
following
days
the
fleets
manoeuvred
in
sight
of
each
other
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
rodney
made
signal
for
the
whole
fleet
to
go
south
under
press
of
sail
the
french
thought
he
was
flying
he
tacked
at
two
in
the
morning
and
at
daybreak
found
himself
where
he
wished
to
be
with
the
french
fleet
on
his
lee
quarter
the
french
looking
for
nothing
but
again
a
distant
cannonade
continued
leisurely
along
under
the
north
highlands
of
dominica
towards
the
channel
which
separates
that
island
from
guadaloupe
in
number
of
ships
the
fleets
were
equal
in
size
and
complement
of
crew
the
french
were
immensely
superior
and
besides
the
ordinary
ships
companies
they
had
twenty
thousand
soldiers
on
board
who
were
to
be
used
in
the
conquest
of
jamaica
knowing
well
that
a
defeat
at
that
moment
would
be
to
england
irreparable
ruin
they
did
not
dream
that
rodney
would
be
allowed
even
if
he
wished
it
to
risk
a
close
and
decisive
engagement
the
english
admiral
was
aware
also
that
his
country
fate
was
in
his
hands
it
was
one
of
those
supreme
moments
which
great
men
dare
to
use
and
small
men
tremble
at
he
had
the
advantage
of
the
wind
and
could
force
a
battle
or
decline
it
as
he
pleased
with
clear
daylight
the
signal
to
engage
was
flying
from
the
masthead
of
the
rodney
ship
at
seven
in
the
morning
april
the
whole
fleet
bore
down
obliquely
on
the
french
line
cutting
it
directly
in
two
rodney
led
in
person
having
passed
through
and
broken
up
their
order
he
tacked
again
still
keeping
the
wind
the
french
thrown
into
confusion
were
unable
to
reform
and
the
battle
resolved
itself
into
a
number
of
separate
engagements
in
which
the
english
had
the
choice
of
position
rodney
in
passing
through
the
enemy
lines
the
first
time
had
exchanged
broadsides
with
the
a
at
close
range
he
had
shot
away
her
masts
and
bowsprit
and
left
her
a
bare
hull
her
flag
however
still
flying
being
nailed
to
a
splintered
spar
so
he
left
her
unable
to
stir
and
after
he
had
gone
about
came
himself
yardarm
to
yardarm
with
the
superb
de
paris
the
pride
of
france
the
largest
ship
in
the
then
world
where
de
grasse
commanded
in
person
all
day
long
the
cannon
roared
rodney
had
on
board
a
favourite
bantam
cock
which
stood
perched
upon
the
poop
of
the
through
the
whole
action
its
shrill
voice
heard
crowing
through
the
thunder
of
the
broadsides
one
by
one
the
french
ships
struck
their
flags
or
fought
on
till
they
foundered
and
went
down
the
carnage
on
board
them
was
terrible
crowded
as
they
were
with
the
troops
for
jamaica
fourteen
thousand
were
reckoned
to
have
been
killed
besides
the
prisoners
the
de
paris
surrendered
last
fighting
desperately
after
hope
was
gone
till
her
masts
were
so
shattered
that
they
could
not
bear
a
sail
and
her
decks
above
and
below
were
littered
over
with
mangled
limbs
de
grasse
gave
up
his
sword
to
rodney
on
the
the
gallant
unable
to
fly
and
seeing
the
battle
lost
hauled
down
her
flag
but
not
till
the
undisabled
remnants
of
her
crew
were
too
few
to
throw
the
dead
into
the
sea
other
ships
took
fire
and
blew
up
half
the
french
fleet
were
either
taken
or
sunk
the
rest
crawled
away
for
the
time
most
of
them
to
be
picked
up
afterwards
like
crippled
birds
so
on
that
memorable
day
was
the
english
empire
saved
peace
followed
but
it
was
with
honour
the
american
colonies
were
lost
but
england
kept
her
west
indies
her
flag
still
floated
over
gibraltar
the
hostile
strength
of
europe
all
combined
had
failed
to
twist
ocean
sceptre
from
her
she
sat
down
maimed
and
bleeding
but
the
wreath
had
not
been
torn
from
her
brow
she
was
still
sovereign
of
the
seas
the
bow
of
ulysses
was
strung
in
those
days
the
order
of
recall
arrived
when
the
work
was
done
it
was
proudly
obeyed
and
even
the
great
burke
admitted
that
no
honour
could
be
bestowed
upon
rodney
which
he
had
not
deserved
at
his
country
hands
if
the
british
empire
is
still
to
have
a
prolonged
career
before
it
the
men
who
make
empires
are
the
men
who
can
hold
them
together
oratorical
reformers
can
overthrow
what
deserves
to
be
overthrown
institutions
even
the
best
of
them
wear
out
and
must
give
place
to
others
and
the
fine
political
speakers
are
the
instruments
of
their
overthrow
but
the
fine
speakers
produce
nothing
of
their
own
and
as
constructive
statesmen
their
paths
are
strewed
with
failures
the
worthies
of
england
are
the
men
who
cleared
and
tilled
her
fields
formed
her
laws
built
her
colleges
and
cathedrals
founded
her
colonies
fought
her
battles
covered
the
ocean
with
commerce
and
spread
our
race
over
the
planet
to
leave
a
mark
upon
it
which
time
will
not
efface
these
men
are
seen
in
their
work
and
are
not
heard
of
in
parliament
when
the
account
is
wound
up
where
by
the
side
of
them
will
stand
our
famous
orators
what
will
any
one
of
these
have
left
behind
him
save
the
wreck
of
institutions
which
had
done
their
work
and
had
ceased
to
serve
a
useful
purpose
that
was
their
business
in
this
world
and
they
did
it
and
do
it
but
it
is
no
very
glorious
work
not
a
work
over
which
it
is
possible
to
feel
any
enthusiasm
to
chop
down
a
tree
is
easier
than
to
make
it
grow
when
the
business
of
destruction
is
once
completed
they
and
their
fame
and
glory
will
disappear
together
our
true
great
ones
will
again
be
visible
and
thenceforward
will
be
visible
alone
is
there
a
single
instance
in
our
own
or
any
other
history
of
a
great
political
speaker
who
has
added
anything
to
human
knowledge
or
to
human
worth
lord
chatham
may
stand
as
a
lonely
exception
but
except
chatham
who
is
there
not
one
that
i
know
of
oratory
is
the
spendthrift
sister
of
the
arts
which
decks
itself
like
a
strumpet
with
the
tags
and
ornaments
which
it
steals
from
real
superiority
the
object
of
it
is
not
truth
but
anything
which
it
can
make
appear
truth
anything
which
it
can
persuade
people
to
believe
by
calling
in
their
passions
to
obscure
their
intelligence

on

at

on

we
were
anchored
in
the
roadstead
at
bridgetown
and
the
island
of
barbadoes
lay
before
us
shining
in
the
haze
of
a
hot
summer
morning
it
is
about
the
size
of
the
isle
of
wight
cultivated
so
far
as
eye
could
see
with
the
completeness
of
a
garden
no
mountains
in
it
scarcely
even
high
hills
but
a
surface
pleasantly
undulating
the
prevailing
colour
a
vivid
green
from
the

fields

in

white
from
the
coral
rock
of
which
they
are
built
but
the
glare
from
them
relieved
by
heavy
clumps
of
trees
what
the
trees
were
i
had
yet
to
discover
you
could
see
at
a
glance
that
the
island
was
as
thickly
peopled
as
an
not
an
inch
of
soil
seemed
to
be
allowed
to
run
to
waste
two
hundred
thousand
is
i
believe
the
present
number
of
barbadians
of
whom
are
blacks
they
refuse
to
emigrate
they
cling
to
their
home
with
innocent
vanity
as
though
it
was
the
finest
country
in
the
world
and
multiply
at
a
rate
so
rapid
that
no
one
likes
to
think
about
it
labour
at
any
rate
is
abundant
and
cheap
in
barbadoes
the
negro
is
willing
enough
to
work
for
he
has
no
other
means
of
living
little
land
is
here
allowed
him
to
grow
his
yams
upon
almost
the
whole
of
it
is
still
held
by
the
whites
in
large
estates
cultivated
by
labourers
on
the
old
system
and
it
is
to
be
admitted
cultivated
most
admirably
if
the
west
indies
are
going
to
ruin
barbadoes
at
any
rate

of

sorts
the
training
squadron
had
come
into
the

day

two
on
their
way
to
trinidad
four
fine
ships
conspicuous
by
their
white
ensigns
a
squareness
of
yards
and
generally
imposing
presence

were
flying

officials
coming
off

dress
with

over

notwithstanding
these
exotic
symptoms
it
was
all
thoroughly
english
we
were
under
the
guns
of
our
own
the
language
of
the
was
pure
english
the
voices
without
the
smallest
transatlantic
intonation
on
no
one
of
our
foreign
possessions
is
the
print
of
england
foot
more
strongly
impressed
than
on
barbadoes
it
has
been
ours
for
two
centuries
and
and
was
organised
from
the
first
on
english
traditional
lines
with
its
constitution
its
parishes
and
parish
churches
and
churchwardens
and
schools
and
parsons
all
on
the
old
model
which
the
unprogressive
inhabitants
have
been
wise
enough
to
leave
undisturbed
little
is
known
of
the
island
before
we
took
possession
of
it
so
little
that
the
origin
of
the
name
is
still
uncertain
barbadoes
if
not
a
corruption
of
some
older
word
is
spanish
or
portuguese
and
means
the
local
opinion
is
that
the
word
refers
to
a
banyan
or
fig
tree
which
is
common
there
and
which
sends
down
from
its
branches
long
hairs
or
fibres
supposed
to
resemble
beards
i
disbelieve
in
this
derivation
every
spaniard
whom
i
have
consulted
confirms
my
own
impression
that
standing
alone
could
no
more
refer
to
trees
than
standing
alone
could
refer
to
trees
in
latin
the
name
is
a
century
older
than
the
english
occupation
for
i
have
seen
it
in
a
spanish
chart
of
the
question
is
of
some
interest
since
it
perhaps
implies
that
at
the
first
discovery
there
was
a
race
of
bearded
caribs
there
however
this
may
be
barbadoes
after
we
became
masters
of
the
island
enjoyed
a
period
of
unbroken
prosperity
for
two
hundred
years
before
the
conquest
of
jamaica
it
was
the
principal
mart
of
our
west
indian
trade
and
even
after
that
conquest
when
all
europe
drew
its
new
luxury
of
sugar
from
these
islands
the
wealth
and
splendour
of
the
english

at

the
envy
of

the
eighteenth
century
he
was
a
clever
sarcastic
kind
of
man
with
fine
literary
skill
and
describes
what
he
saw
with
a
jealous
appreciation
which
he
intended
to
act
upon
his
own
countrymen
the
island
according
to
him
was
running
over
with
wealth
and
was
very
imperfectly
fortified
the
jewellers
and
silversmiths
shops
in
bridgetown
were
brilliant
as
on
the
paris
boulevards
the
port
was
full
of
ships
the
wharves
and
warehouses
crammed
with
merchandise
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
the
streets
were
handsome
and
thronged
with
men
of
business
who
were
piling
up
fortunes
to
the
father
these
sumptuous
gentlemen
were
all
most
civil
the
governor
an
english
milor
asked
him
to
dinner
and
talked
such
excellent
french
that
labat
forgave
him
his
nationality
the
governor
he
said
resided
in
a
fine
palace
he
had
a
library
was
dignified
courteous
intelligent
and
lived
in
state
like
a
prince
a
review
was
held
for
the
french
special
entertainment
of
the
bridgetown
cavalry
five
hundred
gentlemen
turned
out
from
this
one
district
admirably
mounted
and
armed
altogether
in
the
island
he
says
that
there
were
horse
and
foot
every
one
of
them
of
course
white
and
english
the
officers
struck
him
particularly
he
met
one
who
had
been
five
years
a
prisoner
in
the
bastille
and
had
spent
his
time
there
in
learning
mathematics
the
planters
opened
their
houses
to
him
dinners
then
as
now
were
the
received
form
of
english
hospitality
they
lived
well
labat
says
they
had
all
the
luxuries
of
the
tropics
and
they
had
imported
the
partridges
which
they
were
so
fond
of
from
england
they
had
the
costliest
and
choicest
wines
and
knew
how
to
enjoy
them
they
dined
at
two
and
their
dinner
lasted
four
hours
their
mansions
were
superbly
furnished
and
gold
and
silver
plate
he
observed
with
an
eye
to
business
was
so
abundant
that
the
plunder
of
it
would
pay
the
cost
of
an
expedition
for
the
reduction
of
the
island
there
was
another
side
to
all
this
magnificence
which
also
might
be
turned
to
account
by
an
enterprising
enemy
there
were
some
thousands
of
wretched
irish
who
had
been
transplanted
thither
after
the
last
rebellion
and
were
bound
under
articles
to
labour
these
might
be
counted
on
to
rise
if
an
invading
force
appeared
and
there
were
slaves
who
would
rebel
also
if
they
saw
a
hope
of
success
they
were
ill
fed
and
hard
driven
on
the
least
symptom
of
insubordination
they
were
killed
without
mercy
sometimes
they
were
burnt
alive
or
were
hung
up
in
iron
cages
to
die
in
the
french
and
spanish
islands
care
was
taken
of
the
souls
of
the
poor
creatures
they
were
taught
their
catechism
they
were
baptised
and
attended
mass
regularly
the
anglican
clergy
labat
said
with
professional
malice
neither
baptised
them
nor
taught
them
anything
but
regarded
them
as
mere
animals
to
keep
christians
in
slavery
they
held
would
be
wrong
and
indefensible
and
they
therefore
met
the
difficulty
by
not
making
their
slaves
into
christians
that
baptism
made
any
essential
difference
however
he
does
not
insist
by
the
side
of
christianity
in
the
catholic
islands
devil
worship
and
witchcraft
went
on
among
the
same
persons
no
instance
had
ever
come
to
his
knowledge
of
a
converted
black
who
returned
to
his
country
who
did
not
throw
away
his
christianity
just
as
he
would
throw
away
his
clothes
and
as
to
cruelty
and
immorality
he
admits
that
the
english
at
barbadoes
were
no
worse
than
his
own
people
at
martinique
in
the
collapse
of
west
indian
prosperity
which
followed
on
emancipation
barbadoes
escaped
the
misfortunes
of
the
other
islands
the
black
population
being
so
dense
and
the
place
itself
being
so
small
the
squatting
system
could
not
be
tried
there
was
plenty
of
labour
always
and
the
planters
being
relieved
of
the
charge
of
their
workmen
when
they
were
sick
or
worn
out
had
rather
gained
than
lost
by
the
change
barbadoes
however
was
not
to
escape
for
ever
and
was
now
having
its
share
of
misfortunes
it
is
dangerous
for
any
country
to
commit
its
fortunes
to
an
exclusive
occupation
sugar
was
the
most
immediately
lucrative
of
all
the
west
indian
productions
barbadoes
is
exceptionally
well
suited
to
it
has
no
mountains
and
no
forests
the
soil
is
clean
and
has
been
carefully
attended
to
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
it
had
been
owned
during
the
present
century
by
gentlemen
who
for
the
most
part
lived
in
england
on
the
profits
of
their
properties
and
left
them
to
be
managed
by
agents
and
attorneys
the
method
of
management
was
expensive
their
own
habits
were
expensive
their
incomes
to
which
they
had
lived
up
had
been
cut
short
lately
by
a
series
of
bad
seasons
money
had
been
borrowed
at
high
interest
year
after
year
to
keep
the
estates
and
their
owners
going
on
the
top
of
this
came
the
beetroot
competition
backed
up
by
a
bounty
and
the
barbadian
sugar
interest
i
was
told
had
gone
over
a
precipice
even
the
unencumbered
resident
proprietors
could
barely
keep
their
heads
above
water
the
returns
on
of
the
properties
on
the
island
no
longer
sufficed
to
pay
the
expenses
of
cultivation
and
the
interest
of
the
loans
which
had
been
raised
upon
them
there
was
impending
a
general
bankruptcy
which
might
break
up
entirely
the
present
system
and
leave
the
negroes
for
a
time
without
the
wages
which
were
the
sole
dependence
a
very
dark
picture
had
thus
been
drawn
to
me
of
the
prospects
of
the
poor
little
island
which
had
been
once
so
brilliant
nothing
could
be
less
like
it
than
the
bright
sunny
landscape
which
we
saw
from
the
deck
of
our
vessel
the
town
the
shipping
the
pretty
villas
the
woods
and
the
wide
green
sea
of
waving
cane
had
no
suggestion
of
ruin
about
them
if
the
ruin
was
coming
clearly
enough
it
had
not
yet
come
after
breakfast
we
went
on
shore
in
a
boat
with
a
white
awning
over
it
rowed
by
a
crew
of
black
boatmen
large
fleshy
shining
on
the
skin
with
ample
feeding
and
shining
in
the
face
with
innocent
happiness
they
rowed
well
they
were
amusing
there
was
a
fixed
tariff
and
they
were
not
extortionate
the
temperature
seemed
to
rise
ten
degrees
when
we
landed
the
roads
were
blinding
white
from
the
coral
dust
the
houses
were
white
the
sun
scorching
the
streets
were
not
the
streets
described
by
labat
no
splendid
magazines
or
jewellers
shops
like
those
in
paris
or
london
but
there
were
lighters
at
the
quays
loading
or
unloading
carts
dashing
along
with
mule
teams
and
making
walking
dangerous
signs
in
plenty
of
life
and
business
few
white
faces
but
blacks
and
mulattoes
swarming
the
houses
were
substantial
though
in
want
of
paint
the
public
buildings
law
courts
hall
of
assembly
were
solid
and
handsome
nowhere
out
of
repair
though
with
something
to
be
desired
in
point
of
smartness
the
market
square
would
have
been
well
enough
but
for
a
statue
of
lord
nelson
which
stands
there
very
like
but
small
and
insignificant
and
for
some
extraordinary
reason
they
have
painted
it
a
bright
we
crept
along
in
the
shade
of
trees
and
warehouses
till
we
reached
the
principal
street
here
my
friends
brought
me
to
the
icehouse
a
sort
of
club
with
reading
rooms
and
dining
rooms
and
sleeping
accommodation
for
members
from
a
distance
who
do
not
like
colonial
hotels
before
anything
else
could
be
thought
of
i
was
introduced
to
cocktail
with
which
i
had
to
make
closer
acquaintance
afterwards
cocktail
being
the
established
corrective
of
west
indian
languor
without
which
life
is
impossible
it
is
a
compound
of
rum
sugar
lime
juice
angostura
bitters
and
what
else
i
know
not
frisked
into
effervescence
by
a
stick
highly
agreeable
to
the
taste
and
effective
for
its
immediate
purpose
cocktail
over
and
walking
in
the
heat
being
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
i
sat
for
two
hours
in
a
balcony
watching
the
people
who
were
thick
as
bees
in
swarming
time
of
them
were
pure
black
you
rarely
saw
a
white
face
but
still
less
would
you
see
a
discontented
one
imperturbable
good
humour
and
being
written
on
the
features
of
every
one
the
women
struck
me
especially
they
were
smartly
dressed
in
white
calico
scrupulously
clean
and
tricked
out
with
ribands
and
feathers
but
their
figures
were
so
good
and
they
carried
themselves
so
well
and
gracefully
that
although
they
might
make
themselves
absurd
they
could
not
look
vulgar
like
the
old
greek
and
etruscan
women
they
are
trained
from
childhood
to
carry
heavy
weights
on
their
heads
they
are
thus
perfectly
upright
and
plant
their
feet
firmly
and
naturally
on
the
ground
they
might
serve
for
models
and
are
well
aware
of
it
there
were
no
signs
of
poverty
old
and
young
seemed
some
had
brought
in
baskets
of
fruit
bananas
oranges
pine
apples
and
sticks
of
sugar
cane
others
had
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
from
their
bits
of
garden
in
the
country
the
men
were
active
enough
driving
carts
wheeling
barrows
or
selling
flying
fish
which
are
caught
off
the
island
in
shoals
and
are
cheaper
than
herrings
in
yarmouth
they
chattered
like
a
flock
of
jackdaws
but
there
was
no
quarrelling
not
a
drunken
man
was
to
be
seen
and
all
was
merriment
and
good
humour
my
poor
downtrodden
black
brothers
and
sisters
so
far
as
i
could
judge
from
this
first
introduction
looked
to
me
a
very
fortunate
class
of
government
house
where
we
went
to
luncheon
is
a
large
airy
building
shaded
by
heavy
trees
with
a
garden
at
the
back
of
it
west
indian
houses
i
found
afterwards
are
all
constructed
on
the
same
pattern
the
object
being
to
keep
the
sun
out
and
let
in
the
wind
long
verandahs
or
galleries
run
round
them
protected
by
green
venetian
blinds
which
can
be
opened
or
closed
at
pleasure
the
rooms
within
with
polished
floors
little
or
no
carpet
and
contrivances
of
all
kinds
to
keep
the
air
in
continual
circulation
in
the
subdued
green
light
human
figures
lose
their
solidity
and
look
as
if
they
were
creatures
of
air
also
sir
charles
lees
and
his
lady
were
all
that
was
polite
and
hospitable
they
invited
me
to
make
their
house
my
home
during
my
stay
and
more
charming
host
and
hostess
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
find
or
wish
for
there
was
not
the
state
which
labat
described
but
there
was
the
perfection
of
courtesy
a
courtesy
which
must
have
belonged
to
their
natures
or
it
would
have
been
overstrained
long
since
by
the
demands
made
upon
it
those
who
have
looked
on
at
a
skating
ring
will
have
observed
an
orange
or
some
such
object
in
the
centre
round
which
the
evolutions
are
described
the
ice
artist
sweeping
out
from
it
in
long
curves
to
the
extreme
circumference
returning
on
interior
arcs
till
he
gains
the
orange
again
and
then
off
once
more
on
a
fresh
departure

the
west
indian
steam
navigation
is
like
the
orange
all
mails
all
passengers
from
europe
arrive
at
barbadoes
first
there
the
subsidiary
steamers
catch
them
up
bear
them
north
or
south
to
the
windward
or
leeward
isles
and
on
their
return
bring
them
back
to
carlisle
bay
every
vessel
brings
some
person
or
persons
to
whom
the
governor
is
called
on
to
show
hospitality
he
must
give
dinners
to
the
officials
and
gentry
of
the
island
he
must
give
balls
and
concerts
for
their
ladies
he
must
entertain
the
officers
of
the
garrison
when
the
west
indian
squadron
or
the
training
squadron
drop
into

english

take
their

from

and
if
they
are
neglected
regard
it
as
a
national
affront
cataracts
of
champagne
must
flow
if
the
british
name
is
not
to
be
discredited
the
expense
is
unavoidable
and
is
enormous
while
the
governor
very
moderate
salary
is
found
too
large
by
economic
politicians
and
there
is
a
cry
for
reduction
of
it
i
was
of
course
most
grateful
for
sir
charles
invitation
to
myself
from
him
better
perhaps
than
from
anyone
i
could
learn
how
far
the
passionate
complaints
which
i
had
heard
about
the
state
of
the
islands
were
to
be
listened
to
as
accounts
of
actual
fact
i
found
however
that
i
must
postpone
both
this
particular
pleasure
and
my
stay
in
barbadoes
itself
till
a
later
opportunity
my
purpose
had
been
to
remain
there
till
i
had
given
it
all
the
time
which
i
could
spare
thence
to
go
on
to
jamaica
and
from
jamaica
to
return
at
leisure
round
the
antilles
but
it
had
been
ascertained
that
in
jamaica
there
was
i
suppose
that
there
generally
is
there
or
typhus
fever
or
other
infectious
disorder
but
spasms
of
anxiety
assail
periodically
the
souls
of
local
authorities
vessels
coming
from
jamaica
had
been
quarantined
in
all
the
islands
and
i
found
that
if
i
proceeded
thither
as
i
proposed
i
should
be
refused
permission
to
land
afterwards
in
any
one
of
the
other
colonies
in
my
perplexity
my
trinidad
friends
invited
me
to
accompany
them
at
once
to
port
of
spain
trinidad
was
the
most
thriving
or
was
at
all
events
the
least
dissatisfied
of
all
the
british
possessions
i
could
have
a
glance
at
the
windward
islands
on
the
way
i
could
afterwards
return
to
barbadoes
where
sir
charles
assured
me
that
i
should
still
find
a
room
waiting
for
me
the
steamer
to
trinidad
sailed
the
same
afternoon
i
had
to
decide
in
haste
and
i
decided
to
go
our
luncheon
over
we
had
time
to
look
over
the
pretty
gardens
at
government
house
there
were
great
cabbage
palms
trees
mahogany
trees
almond
trees
and
many
more
which
were
wholly
new
acquaintances
there
was
a
grotto
made
by
climbing
plants
and
creepers
with
a
fountain
playing
in
the
middle
of
it
where
orchids
hanging
on
wires
threw
out
their
clusters
of
flowers
for
the
moths
to
fertilize
ferns
waved
their
long
fronds
in
the
dripping
showers
humming
birds
cooled
their
wings
in
the
spray
and
flashed
in
and
out
like
rubies
and
emeralds
gladly
would
i
have
lingered
there
at
least
for
a
cigar
but
it
could
not
be
we
had
to
call
on
the
commander
of
the
forces
sir
pearson
the
hero
of
ekowe
in
the
zulu
war
him
too
i
was
to
see
again
and
hear
interesting
stories
from
about
our
tragic
enterprise
in
the
transvaal
for
the
moment
my
mind
was
filled
sufficiently
with
new
impressions
one
reads
books
about
places
but
the
images
which
they
create
are
always
unlike
the
real
object
all
that
i
had
seen
was
absolutely
new
and
unexpected
i
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
readjust
the
information
which
i
had
brought
with
me
we
joined
our
new
vessel
before
sunset
and
we
steamed
away
into
the
twilight
footnotes
labat
seems
to
say
that
they
were
hung
up
alive
in
these
cages
and
left
to
die
there
he
says
elsewhere
and
it
may
be
hoped
that
the
explanation
is
the
truer
one
that
the
recently
imported
negroes
often
destroyed
themselves
in
the
belief
that
when
dead
they
would
return
to
their
own
country
in
the
french
islands
as
well
as
the
english
the
bodies
of
suicides
were
exposed
in
these
cages
from
which
they
could
not
be
stolen
to
convince
the
poor
people
of
their
mistake
by
their
own
eyes
he
says
that
the
contrivance
was
successful
and
that
after
this
the
slaves
did
not
destroy
themselves

the
pushing
manners
which
belong
to
younger
and
perhaps
more
thriving
communities
the
west
indians
themselves
though
they
may
be
deficient
in
energy
are
uniformly
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
all
their
arrangements
take
their
complexion
from
the
general
tone
of
society
there
is
a
refinement
visible
at
once
in
the
subsidiary
vessels
of
the
mail
service
which
ply
among
the
islands
they
are
almost
as
large
as
those
which
cross
the
atlantic
and
never
on
any
line
in
the
world
have
i
met
with
officers
so
courteous
and
cultivated
the
cabins
were
spacious
and
as
cool
as
a
temperature
of
gradually
rising
as
we
went
south
would
permit
punkahs
waved
over
us
at
dinner
in
our
berths
a
single
sheet
was
all
that
was
provided
for
us
and
this
was
one
more
than
we
needed
a
sea
was
running
when
we
cleared
out
from
under
the
land
among
the
cabin
passengers
was
a
coloured
family
in
good
circumstances
moving
about
with
nurses
and
children
the
little
things
who
had
never
been
at
sea
before
sat
on
the
floor
staring
out
of
their
large
helpless
black
eyes
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
with
them
forward
there
were
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
coloured
people
going
from
one
island
to
another
singing
dancing
and
chattering
all
night
long
as
radiant
and
happy
as
carelessness
and
content
could
make
them
sick
or
not
sick
made
no
difference
nothing
could
disturb
the
imperturbable
good
humour
and
good
spirits
it
was
too
hot
to
sleep
we
sat
several
of
us
smoking
on
deck
and
i
learnt
the
first
authentic
particulars
of
the
present
manner
of
life
of
these
much
misunderstood
people
evidently
they
belonged
to
a
race
far
inferior
to
the
zulus
and
caffres
whom
i
had
known
in
south
africa
they
were
more
coarsely
formed
in
limb
and
feature
they
would
have
been
slaves
in
their
own
country
if
they
had
not
been
brought
to
ours
and
at
the
worst
had
lost
nothing
by
the
change
they
were
innocent
harmless
lazy
perhaps
but
not
more
lazy
than
is
perfectly
natural
when
even
europeans
must
be
roused
to
activity
by
cocktail
in
the
antilles
generally
barbadoes
being
the
only
exception
negro
families
have
each
their
cabin
their
garden
ground
their
grazing
for
a
cow
they
live
surrounded
by
most
of
the
fruits
which
grew
in
paradise
oranges
and
plantains
and
though
not
apples
their
yams
and
cassava
grow
without
effort
for
the
soil
is
easily
worked
and
inexhaustibly
fertile
the
curse
is
taken
off
from
nature
and
like
adam
again
they
are
under
the
covenant
of
innocence
morals
in
the
technical
sense
they
have
none
but
they
can
not
be
said
to
sin
because
they
have
no
knowledge
of
a
law
and
therefore
they
can
commit
no
breach
of
the
law
they
are
naked
and
not
ashamed
they
are
as
they
call
it
but
not
the
woman
prefers
a
looser
tie
that
she
may
be
able
to
leave
a
man
if
he
treats
her
unkindly
yet
they
are
not
licentious
i
never
saw
an
immodest
look
in
one
their
faces
and
never
heard
of
any
venal
profligacy
the
system
is
strange
but
it
answers
a
missionary
told
me
that
a
connection
rarely
turns
out
well
which
begins
with
a
legal
marriage
the
children
scramble
up
anyhow
and
shift
for
themselves
like
chickens
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
peck
many
die
in
this
way
by
eating
unwholesome
food
but
also
many
live
and
those
who
do
live
grow
up
exactly
like
their
parents
it
is
a
very
peculiar
state
of
things
not
to
be
understood
as
priest
and
missionary
agree
without
long
acquaintance
there
is
immorality
but
an
immorality
which
is
not
demoralising
there
is
sin
but
it
is
the
sin
of
animals
without
shame
because
there
is
no
sense
of
doing
wrong
they
eat
the
forbidden
fruit
but
it
brings
with
it
no
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
they
steal
but
as
a
tradition
of
the
time
when
they
were
themselves
chattels
and
the
laws
of
property
did
not
apply
to
them
they
are
honest
about
money
more
honest
perhaps
than
a
good
many
whites
but
food
or
articles
of
use
they
take
freely
as
they
were
allowed
to
do
when
slaves
in
pure
innocence
of
heart
in
fact
these
poor
children
of
darkness
have
escaped
the
consequences
of
the
fall
and
must
come
of
another
stock
after
all
meanwhile
they
are
perfectly
happy
in
no
part
of
the
globe
is
there
any
peasantry
whose
every
want
is
so
completely
satisfied
as
her
black
subjects
in
these
west
indian
islands
they
have
no
aspirations
to
make
them
restless
they
have
no
guilt
upon
their
consciences
they
have
food
for
the
picking
up
clothes
they
need
not
and
lodging
in
such
a
climate
need
not
be
elaborate
they
have
perfect
liberty
and
are
safe
from
dangers
to
which
if
left
to
themselves
they
would
be
exposed
for
the
english
rule
prevents
the
strong
from
oppressing
the
weak
in
their
own
country
they
would
have
remained
slaves
to
more
warlike
races
in
the
west
indies
their
fathers
underwent
a
bondage
of
a
century
or
two
lighter
at
its
worst
than
the
easiest
form
of
it
in
africa
their
descendants
in
return
have
nothing
now
to
do
save
to
laugh
and
sing
and
enjoy
existence
their
quarrels
if
they
have
any
begin
and
end
in
words
if
happiness
is
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
life
and
those
who
have
most
of
it
have
most
completely
attained
the
object
of
their
being
the
who
now
basks
among
the
ruins
of
the
west
indian
plantations
is
the
supremest
specimen
of
present
humanity
we
retired
to
our
berths
at
last
at
waking
we
were
at
anchor
off
vincent
an
island
of
volcanic
mountains
robed
in
forest
from
shore
to
crest
till
late
in
the
last
century
it
was
the
headquarters
of
the
caribs
who
kept
up
a
savage
independence
there
recruited
by
runaway
slaves
from
barbadoes
or
elsewhere
brandy
and
sir
ralph
abercrombie
reduced
them
to
obedience
in
and
vincent
throve
tolerably
down
to
the
days
of
free
trade
even
now
when
i
saw
it
kingston
the
principal
town
looked
pretty
and
well
to
do
reminding
me
strange
to
say
of
towns
in
norway
the
houses
stretching
along
the
shore
painted
in
the
same
tints
of
blue
or
yellow
or
pink
with
the
same
roofs
the
trees
coming
down
the
hill
sides
to
the
water
edge
villas
of
modest
pretensions
shining
through
the
foliage
with
the
patches
of
cane
fields
the
equivalent
in
the
landscape
of
the
brilliant
norwegian
grass
the
prosperity
has
for
the
last
forty
years
waned
and
waned
there
are
now
two
thousand
white
people
there
and
forty
thousand
coloured
people
and
proportions
alter
annually
to
our
disadvantage
the
usual
remedies
have
been
tried
the
constitution
has
been
altered
a
dozen
times
just
now
i
believe
the
crown
is
trying
to
do
without
one
having
found
the
results
of
the
elective
principle
not
encouraging
but
we
shall
perhaps
revert
to
it
before
long
any
way
the
tables
show
that
each
year
the
trade
of
the
island
decreases
and
will
continue
to
decrease
while
the
expenditure
increases
and
will
increase
i
did
not
land
for
the
time
was
short
and
as
a
beautiful
picture
the
island
was
best
seen
from
the
deck
the
characteristics
of
the
people
are
the
same
in
all
the
antilles
and
could
be
studied
elsewhere
the
bustle
and
confusion
in
the
ship
the
crowd
of
boats
round
the
ladder
the
clamour
of
negro
men
tongues
and
the
blaze
of
colours
from
the
negro
women
dresses
made
up
together
a
scene
sufficiently
entertaining
for
the
hour
which
we
remained
in
the
middle
of
it
the
governor
s
came
on
board
with
another
official
they
were
going
on
in
the
steamer
to
tobago
which
formed
part
of
his
dominions
leaving
vincent
we
were
all
the
forenoon
passing
the
grenadines
a
string
of
small
islands
fitting
into
their
proper
place
in
the
antilles
semicircle
but
as
if
nature
had
forgotten
to
put
them
together
or
else
had
broken
some
large
island
to
pieces
and
scattered
them
along
the
line
some
were
large
enough
to
have
once
carried
sugar
plantations
and
are
now
made
over
wholly
to
the
blacks
others
were
fishing
stations
droves
of
whales
during
certain
months
frequenting
these
waters
others
were
mere
rocks
amidst
which
the
american
coasting
schooners
were
beating
up
against
the
trade
there
was
a
stiff
breeze
and
the
sea
was
white
with
short
curling
waves
but
we
were
running
before
it
and
the
wind
kept
the
deck
fresh
at
grenada
the
next
island
we
were
to
go
on
shore
grenada
was
like
vincent
the
home
for
centuries
of
caribs
french
for
a
century
and
a
half
and
finally
after
many
desperate
struggles
for
it
was
ceded
to
england
at
the
peace
of
versailles
it
is
larger
than
vincent
though
in
its
main
features
it
has
the
same
character
there
are
lakes
in
the
hills
and
a
volcanic
crater
not
wholly
quiescent
but
the
especial
value
of
grenada
which
made
us
fight
so
hardly
to
win
it
is
the
deep
and
landlocked
harbour
the
finest
in
all
the
antilles
père
labat
to
whose
countrymen
it
belonged
at
the
time
of
his
own
visit
there
says
that
barbadoes
had
such
a
harbour
as
grenada
it
would
be
an
island
without
a
rival
in
the
world
if
grenada
belonged
to
the
english
who
knew
how
to
turn
to
profit
natural
advantages
it
would
be
a
rich
and
powerful
colony
in
itself
it
was
all
that
man
could
desire
to
live
there
was
to
live
in
paradise
labat
found
the
island
occupied
by
countrymen
of
his
own
he
calls
them
growing
their
tobacco
their
indigo
and
scarlet
rocou
their
pigs
and
their
poultry
and
contented
to
be
without
sugar
without
slaves
and
without
trade
the
change
of
hands
from
which
he
expected
so
much
had
actually
come
about
grenada
did
belong
to
the
english
and
had
belonged
to
us
ever
since
rodney
peace
i
was
anxious
to
see
how
far
prophecy
had
been
fulfilled
george
the
stands
on
the
neck
of
a
peninsula
a
mile
in
length
which
forms
one
side
of
the
harbour
of
the
houses
some
look
out
to
sea
some
inwards
upon
the
as
the
harbour
is
called
at
the
point
there
was
a
fort
apparently
of
some
strength
on
which
the
british
flag
was
flying
we
signalled
that
we
had
the
governor
on
board
and
the
fort
replied
with
a
puff
of
smoke
sound
there
was
none
or
next
to
none
but
we
presumed
that
it
had
come
from
a
gun
of
some
kind
we
anchored
outside
s
landed
in
an
official
boat
with
two
flags
a
missionary
in
another
which
had
only
one
the
crews
of
a
dozen
other
boats
then
clambered
up
the
gangway
to
dispute
possession
of
the
rest
of
us
shouting
swearing
lying
tearing
us
this
way
and
that
way
as
if
we
were
carcases
and
they
wild
beasts
wanting
to
dine
upon
us
we
engaged
a
boat
for
ourselves
as
we
supposed
we
had
no
sooner
entered
it
than
the
scandalous
boatman
proceeded
to
take
in
as
many
more
passengers
as
it
would
hold
remonstrance
being
vain
we
settled
the
matter
by
stepping
into
the
boat
next
adjoining
and
amidst
howls
and
execrations
we
were
borne
triumphantly
off
and
were
pulled
in
to
the
land
labat
had
not
exaggerated
the
beauty
of
the
landlocked
basin
into
which
we
entered
on
rounding
the
point
on
three
sides
wooded
hills
rose
high
till
they
passed
into
mountains
on
the
fourth
was
the
castle
with
its
slopes
and
batteries
the
church
and
town
beyond
it
and
everywhere
luxuriant
tropical
forest
trees
overhanging
the
water
i
could
well
understand
the
frenchman
delight
when
he
saw
it
and
also
the
satisfaction
with
which
he
would
now
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
a
shortsighted
prophet
the
english
had
obtained
grenada
and
this
is
what
they
had
made
of
it
the
forts
which
had
been
erected
by
his
countrymen
had
been
deserted
and
dismantled
the
castle
on
which
we
had
seen
our
flag
flying
was
a
ruin
the
walls
were
crumbling
and
in
many
places
had
fallen
down
one
solitary
gun
was
left
but
that
was
honeycombed
and
could
be
fired
only
with
half
a
charge
to
salute
with
it
was
true
that
the
forts
had
ceased
to
be
of
use
but
that
was
because
there
was
nothing
left
to
defend
the
harbour
is
as
i
said
the
best
in
the
west
indies
there
was
not
a
vessel
in
it
nor
so
much
as
a
that
i
could
see
where
a
spar
could
be
replaced
or
a
broken
rivet
mended
once
there
had
been
a
line
of
wharves
but
the
piles
had
been
eaten
by
worms
and
the
platforms
had
fallen
through
round
us
when
we
landed
were
unroofed
warehouses
courtyards
doors
gone
and
window
frames
fallen
in
or
out
such
a
scene
of
desolation
and
desertion
i
never
saw
in
my
life
save
once
a
few
weeks
later
at
jamaica
an
english
lady
with
her
children
had
come
to
the
landing
place
to
meet
my
friends
they
too
were
more
like
wandering
ghosts
than
human
beings
with
warm
blood
in
them
all
their
thoughts
were
on
going
home
home
out
of
so
miserable
an
exile
nature
and
the
dark
race
had
been
simply
allowed
by
us
to
resume
possession
of
the
island
here
where
the
cannon
had
roared
and
ships
and
armies
had
fought
and
the
enterprising
english
had
entered
into
occupancy
under
whom
as
we
are
proud
to
fancy
the
waste
places
of
the
earth
grow
green
and
industry
and
civilisation
follow
as
an
inevitable
fruit
all
was
now
silence
and
this
was
an
english
crown
colony
as
rich
in
resources
as
any
area
of
soil
of
equal
size
in
the
world
england
had
demanded
and
seized
the
responsibility
of
managing
it
this
was
the
result
a
gentleman
who
for
some
purpose
was
a
passing
resident
in
the
island
had
asked
us
to
dine
with
him
his
house
was
three
or
four
miles
inland
a
good
road
remained
as
a
legacy
from
other
times
and
a
pair
of
horses
and
a
phaeton
carried
us
swiftly
to
his
door
the
town
of
had
once
been
populous
and
even
now
there
seemed
no
want
of
people
if
mere
numbers
sufficed
we
passed
for
half
a
mile
through
a
straggling
street
where
the
houses
were
evidently
occupied
though
unconscious
for
many
a
year
of
paint
or
repair
they
were
squalid
and
dilapidated
but
the
luxuriant
bananas
and
orange
trees
in
the
gardens
relieved
the
ugliness
of
their
appearance
the
road
when
we
left
the
town
was
overshadowed
with
gigantic
mangoes
planted
long
ago
with
almond
trees
and
cedar
trees
no
relations
of
our
almonds
or
our
cedars
but
the
most
splendid
ornaments
of
the
west
indian
forest
the
valley
up
which
we
drove
was
beautiful
and
the
house
when
we
reached
it
showed
taste
and
culture
had
rare
trees
rare
flowers
and
was
taking
advantage
of
his
temporary
residence
in
the
tropics
to
make
experiments
in
horticulture
he
had
been
brought
there
i
believe
by
some
necessities
of
business
he
told
us
that
grenada
was
now
the
ideal
country
of
modern
social
reformers
it
had
become
an
island
of
pure
peasant
proprietors
the
settlers
who
had
once
been
a
thriving
and
wealthy
community
had
almost
melted
away
some
thirty
english
estates
remained
which
could
still
be
cultivated
and
were
being
cultivated
with
remarkable
success
but
the
rest
had
sold
their
estates
for
anything
which
they
could
get
the
free
blacks
had
bought
them
and
about
negro
families
say
black
souls
in
all
now
shared
of
the
soil
between
them
each
family
lived
independently
growing
coffee
and
cocoa
and
oranges
and
all
were
doing
very
well
the
possession
of
property
had
brought
a
sense
of
its
rights
with
it
they
were
as
litigious
as
irish
peasants
everyone
was
at
law
with
his
neighbour
and
the
island
was
a
gold
mine
to
the
otherwise
they
were
quiet
harmless
fellows
and
if
the
politicians
would
only
let
them
alone
they
would
be
perfectly
contented
and
might
eventually
if
wisely
managed
come
to
some
good
to
set
up
a
constitution
in
such
a
place
was
a
ridiculous
mockery
and
would
only
be
another
name
for
swindling
and
jobbery
black
the
island
was
and
black
it
would
remain
the
conditions
were
never
likely
to
arise
which
would
bring
back
a
european
population
but
a
governor
who
was
a
sensible
man
who
would
reside
and
use
his
natural
influence
could
manage
it
with
perfect
ease
the
island
belonged
to
england
we
were
responsible
for
what
we
made
of
it
and
for
the
blacks
own
sakes
we
ought
not
to
try
experiments
upon
them
they
knew
their
own
deficiencies
and
would
infinitely
prefer
a
wise
english
ruler
to
any
constitution
which
could
be
offered
them
if
left
entirely
to
themselves
they
would
in
a
generation
or
two
relapse
into
savages
there
were
but
two
alternatives
before
not
grenada
only
but
all
the
english
west
indies
either
an
english
administration
pure
and
simple
like
the
east
indian
or
a
falling
eventually
into
a
state
like
that
of
hayti
where
they
eat
the
babies
and
no
white
man
can
own
a
yard
of
land
it
was
dark
night
when
we
drove
back
to
the
port
the
houses
along
the
road
which
had
looked
so
miserable
on
the
outside
were
now
lighted
with
paraffin
lamps
i
could
see
into
them
and
was
astonished
to
observe
signs
of
comfort
and
even
signs
of
taste
sofas
sideboards
with
cut
glass
upon
them
engravings
and
coloured
prints
upon
the
walls
the
old
state
of
things
is
gone
but
a
new
state
of
things
is
rising
which
may
have
a
worth
of
its
own
the
plant
of
civilisation
as
yet
has
taken
but
feeble
root
and
is
only
beginning
to
grow
it
may
thrive
yet
if
those
who
have
troubled
all
the
earth
will
consent
for
another
century
to
take
their
industry
elsewhere
the
ship
galley
was
waiting
at
the
wharf
when
we
reached
it
the
captain
also
had
been
dining
with
a
friend
on
shore
and
we
had
to
wait
for
him
the
night
breeze
had
not
yet
risen
the
harbour
was
smooth
as
a
looking
glass
and
the
stars
shone
double
in
the
sky
and
on
the
water
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
whistle
of
the
lizards
or
the
cry
of
some
marsh
frog
the
air
was
warmer
than
we
ever
feel
it
in
the
depth
of
an
english
summer
yet
pure
and
delicious
and
charged
with
the
perfume
of
a
thousand
flowers
one
felt
it
strange
that
with
so
beautiful
a
possession
lying
at
our
doors
we
should
have
allowed
it
to
slide
out
of
our
hands
i
could
say
for
myself
like
père
labat
the
island
was
all
that
man
could
desire
un
mot
la
vie
y
est
délicieuse
the
anchor
was
got
up
immediately
that
we
were
on

in
the
morning
we
were
to
find
ourselves
at

who
had
joined

i
said
going

took
the
human
part
of
his
robinson
crusoe
from
the
story
of
juan
fernandez
the
locality
is
supposed
to
have
been
tobago
and
trinidad
the
island
from
which
the
cannibal
savages
came
we
are
continually
shuffling
the
cards
in
a
hope
that
a
better
game
may
be
played
with
them
tobago
is
to
trinidad
last
year
it
was
a
part
of
s
dominions
which
he
periodically
visited
i
fell
in
with
him
again
on
his
return
and
he
told
us
an
incident
which
befell
him
there
illustrating
the
unexpected
shapes
in
which
the
schoolmaster
is
appearing
among
the
blacks
an
intimation
was
brought
to
him
on
his
arrival
that
as
the
athenian
journeymen
had
played
pyramus
and
thisbe
at
the
nuptials
of
theseus
and
hippolyta
so
a
party
of
villagers
from
the
interior
of
tobago
would
like
to
act
before
his
excellency
of
course
he
consented
they
came
and
went
through
their
performance
to
s
and
probably
to
the
reader
astonishment
the
play
which
they
had
selected
was
the
of
venice
of
the
rest
of
it
he
perhaps
thought
like
the
queen
of
the
amazons
that
it
was
stuff
but
shylock
representative
he
said
showed
real
appreciation
with
freedom
and
a
peasant
proprietary
the
money
lender
is
a
necessary
phenomenon
and
the
actor
imagination
may
have
been
assisted
by
personal
recollections
footnotes
i
have
been
told
that
this
picture
is
overdrawn
that
grenada
is
the
most
prosperous
of
the
antilles
that
its
exports
are
increasing
that
english
owners
are
making
large
profits
again
that
the
blacks
are
thriving
beyond
example
that
there
are
twenty
guns
in
the
fort
that
the
wharves
and
quay
are
in
perfect
condition
that
there
are
no
roofless
warehouses
that
in
my
description
of
george
i
must
have
been
asleep
or
dreaming
i
can
only
repeat
and
insist
upon
what
i
myself
saw
i
know
very
well
that
in
parts
of
the
island
a
few
energetic
english
gentlemen
are
cultivating
their
land
with
remarkable
success
any
enterprising
englishman
with
capital
and
intelligence
might
do
the
same
i
know
also
that
in
no
part
of
the
west
indies
are
the
blacks
happier
or
better
off
but
notwithstanding
the
english
interest
in
the
island
has
sunk
to
relatively
nothing
once
englishmen
owned
the
whole
of
it
now
there
are
only
thirty
english
estates
there
are
five
thousand
peasant
freeholds
owned
almost
entirely
by
coloured
men
and
the
effect
of
the
change
is
written
upon
the
features
of
the
harbour
not
a
vessel
of
any
kind
was
to
be
seen
in
it
the
great
wooden
jetty
where
cargoes
used
to
be
landed
or
taken
on
board
was
a
wreck
the
piles
eaten
through
the
platform
broken
on
the
quay
there
was
no
sign
of
life
or
of
business
the
houses
along
the
side
mean
and
insignificant
while
several
large
and
once
important
buildings
warehouses
custom
houses
dwelling
houses
or
whatever
they
had
been
were
lying
in
ruins
tropical
trees
growing
in
the
courtyards
and
tropical
creepers
climbing
over
the
masonry
showing
how
long
the
decay
had
been
going
on
these
buildings
had
once
belonged
to
english
merchants
and
were
evidence
of
english
energy
and
enterprise
which
once
had
been
and
now
had
ceased
to
be
as
to
the
guns
in
the
fort
i
can
not
say
how
much
old
iron
may
be
left
there
but
i
was
informed
that
only
one
gun
could
be
fired
and
that
with
but
half
a
charge
this
is
of
little
consequence
or
none
but
unless
the
english
population
can
be
reinforced
grenada
in
another
generation
will
cease
to
be
english
at
all
while
the
prosperity
the
progress
even
the
continued
civilisation
of
the
blacks
depends
on
the
maintenance
there
of
english
influence
and
authority

a

for
the
natural

of
the
place
its
forests
and

its
exquisite
flora
the
loveliness
of
its
birds
and
insects
have
been
described
already
with
a
grace
of
touch
and
a
fullness
of
knowledge
which
i
could
not
rival
if
i
tried
by
my
dear
friend
charles
kingsley
he
was
a
naturalist
by
instinct
and
the
west
indies
and
all
belonging
to
them
had
been
the
passion
of
his
life
he
had
followed
the
logs
and
journals
of
the
elizabethan
adventurers
till
he
had
made
their
genius
part
of
himself
in
amyas
leigh
the
hero
of
ho
he
produced
a
figure
more
completely
representative
of
that
extraordinary
set
of
men
than
any
other
novelist
except
sir
walter
has
ever
done
for
an
age
remote
from
his
own
he
followed
them
down
into
their
latest
developments
and
sang
their
swan
song
in
his
of
the
last
buccaneer
so
characteristic
is
this
poem
of
the
transformation
of
the
west
indies
of
romance
and
adventure
into
the
west
indies
of
sugar
and
legitimate
trade
that
i
steal
it
to
ornament
my
own
prosaic
pages
the
lay
of
the
last
buccaneer
oh
england
is
a
pleasant
place
for
them
that
rich
and
high
but
england
is
a
cruel
place
for
such
poor
folks
as
i
and
such
a
port
for
mariners
i
never
see
again
as
the
pleasant
isle
of
aves
beside
the
spanish
main
there
were
forty
craft
in
aves
that
were
both
swift
and
stout
all
furnished
well
with
small
arms
and
cannon
all
about
and
a
thousand
men
in
aves
made
laws
so
fair
and
free
to
choose
their
valiant
captains
and
obey
them
loyally
then
we
sailed
against
the
spaniard
with
his
hoards
of
plate
and
gold
which
he
wrung
with
cruel
tortures
from
indian
folks
of
old
likewise
the
merchant
captains
with
hearts
as
hard
as
stone
who
flog
men
and
keelhaul
them
and
starve
them
to
the
bone
oh
palms
grew
high
in
aves
and
fruits
that
shone
like
gold
and
the
colibris
and
parrots
they
were
gorgeous
to
behold
and
the
negro
maids
to
aves
from
bondage
fast
did
flee
to
welcome
gallant
sailors
a
sweeping
in
from
sea
oh
sweet
it
was
in
aves
to
hear
the
landward
breeze
a
swing
with
good
tobacco
in
a
net
between
the
trees
with
a
negro
lass
to
fan
you
while
you
listened
to
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
reef
outside
which
never
touched
the
shore
but
scripture
saith
an
ending
to
all
fine
things
must
be
so
the
king
ships
sailed
on
aves
and
quite
put
down
were
we
all
day
we
fought
like
bull
dogs
but
they
burnt
the
booms
at
night
and
i
fled
in
a
piragua
sore
wounded
from
the
fight
nine
days
i
floated
starving
and
a
negro
lass
beside
till
for
all
i
tried
to
cheer
her
the
poor
young
thing
she
died
but
as
i
lay
a
gasping
a
bristol
sail
came
by
and
brought
me
home
to
england
here
to
beg
until
i
die
and
now
i
old
and
going
i
sure
i
ca
tell
where
one
comfort
is
this
world
so
hard
i
ca
be
worse
off
there
if
i
might
but
be
a
sea
dove
i
fly
across
the
main
to
the
pleasant
isle
of
aves
to
look
at
it
once
again
by
the
side
of
this
imaginative
picture
of
a
poor
english
sea
rover
let
me
place
another
an
authentic
one
of
a
french
or
pirate
in
the
same
seas
kingsley
aves
or
isle
of
birds
is
down
on
the
american
coast
there
is
another
island
of
the
same
name
which
was
occasionally
frequented
by
the
same
gentry
about
a
hundred
miles
south
of
dominica
père
labat
going
once
from
martinique
to
guadaloupe
had
taken
a
berth
with
captain
daniel
one
of
the
most
noted
of
the
french
corsairs
of
the
day
for
better
security
people
were
not
scrupulous
in
those
times
and
labat
and
daniel
had
been
long
good
friends
they
were
caught
in
a
gale
off
dominica
blown
away
and
carried
to
aves
where
they
found
an
english
merchant
ship
lying
a
wreck
two
english
ladies
from
barbadoes
and
a
dozen
other
people
had
escaped
on
shore
they
had
sent
for
help
and
a
large
vessel
came
for
them
the
day
after
arrival
of
course
he
made
a
prize
of
it
labat
said
prayers
on
board
for
him
before
the
engagement
and
the
vessel
surrendered
after
the
first
shot
the
good
humour
of
the
party
was
not
disturbed
by
this
incident
the
pirates
their
prisoners
and
the
ladies
stayed
together
for
a
fortnight
at
aves
catching
turtles
and
boucanning
them
picnicking
and
enjoying
themselves
daniel
treated
the
ladies
with
the
utmost
politeness
carried
them
afterwards
to
thomas
dismissed
them
unransomed
sold
his
prizes
and
wound
up
the
whole
affair
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
labat
relates
all
this
with
wonderful
humour
and
tells
among
other
things
the
following
story
of
daniel
on
some
expedition
when
he
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
have
a
priest
on
board
he
was
in
want
of
provisions
being
an
outlaw
he
could
not
furnish
himself
in
an
open
port
one
night
he
put
into
the
harbour
of
a
small
island
called
los
santos
not
far
from
dominica
where
only
a
few
families
resided
he
sent
a
boat
on
shore
in
the
darkness
took
the
priest
and
two
or
three
of
the
chief
inhabitants
out
of
their
beds
and
carried
them
on
board
where
he
held
them
as
hostages
and
then
under
pretence
of
compulsion
requisitioned
the
island
to
send
him
what
he
wanted
the
priest
and
his
companions
were
treated
meanwhile
as
guests
of
distinction
no
violence
was
necessary
for
all
parties
understood
one
another
while
the
stores
were
being
collected
daniel
suggested
that
there
was
a
good
opportunity
for
his
crew
to
hear
mass
the
priest
of
los
santos
agreed
to
say
it
for
them
the
sacred
vessels
were
sent
for
from
the
church
on
shore
an
awning
was
rigged
over
the
forecastle
and
an
altar
set
up
under
it
the
men
chanted
the
prayers
the
cannon
answered
the
purpose
of
music
broadsides
were
fired
at
the
first
sentence
at
the
at
the
at
the
and
a
fifth
at
the
prayer
for
the
king
the
service
was
wound
up
by
a
le
a
single
small
accident
only
had
disturbed
the
ceremony
one
of
the
pirates
at
the
being
of
a
profane
mind
made
an
indecent
gesture
daniel
rebuked
him
and
as
the
offence
was
repeated
drew
a
pistol
and
blew
the
man
brains
out
saying
he
would
do
the
same
to
any
one
who
was
disrespectful
to
the
holy
sacrament
the
priest
being
a
little
startled
daniel
begged
him
not
to
be
alarmed
he
was
only
chastising
a
rascal
to
teach
him
his
duty
at
any
rate
as
labat
observed
he
had
effectually
prevented
the
rascal
from
doing
anything
of
the
same
kind
again
mass
being
over
the
body
was
thrown
overboard
and
priest
and
congregation
went
their
several
ways
kingsley
last
gave
trinidad
an
additional
interest
to
me
but
even
he
had
not
prepared
me
completely
for
the
place
which
i
was
to
see
it
is
only
when
one
has
seen
any
object
with
one
own
eyes
that
the
accounts
given
by
others
become
recognisable
and
instructive
trinidad
is
the
largest
after
jamaica
of
the
british
west
indian
islands
and
the
hottest
absolutely
after
none
of
them
it
is
and
i
suppose
was
once
a
part
of
south
america
the
orinoco
river
and
the
ocean
currents
between
them
have
cut
a
channel
between
it
and
the
mainland
which
has
expanded
into
a
vast
shallow
lake
known
as
the
gulf
of
paria
the
two
entrances
by
which
the
gulf
is
approached
are
narrow
and
are
called
or
mouths
one
the
mouth
the
other
the
serpent
when
the
orinoco
is
in
flood
the
water
is
brackish
and
the
brilliant
violet
blue
of
the
caribbean
sea
is
changed
to
a
dirty
yellow
but
the
harbour
which
is
so
formed
would
hold
all
the
commercial
navies
of
the
world
and
seems
formed
by
nature
to
be
the
depôt
one
day
of
an
enormous
trade
trinidad
has
had
its
period
of
romance
columbus
was
the
first
discoverer
of
it
raleigh
was
there
afterwards
on
his
expedition
in
search
of
his
gold
mine
and
tarred
his
vessels
with
pitch
out
of
the
famous
lake
the
island
was
alternately
spanish
and
french
till
picton
took
it
in
since
which
time
it
has
remained
english
the
carib
part
of
the
population
has
long
vanished
the
rest
of
it
is
a
medley
of
english
french
spaniards
negroes
and
coolies
the
english
chiefly
migratory
go
there
to
make
money
and
go
home
with
it
the
old
colonial
families
have
few
representatives
left
but
the
island
prospers
trade
increases
coolies
increase
cocoa

plantations
increase
port
of
spain
the
capital
grows
annually
and
even
sugar
holds
its
own
in
spite
of
low
prices
for
there
is
money
at
the
back
of
it
and
a
set
of
people
who
being
speculative
and
commercial
are
better
on
a
level
with
the
times
than
the

aristocracy
of

the

of
extreme
fertility
about
a
fourth
of
it
under
cultivation
the
rest
natural

and
unappropriated
crown
land
we
passed
the
jaws
before
daylight
the
sun
had
just
risen
when
we
anchored
off
port
of
spain
we
saw
before
us
the
usual
long
line
of
green
hills
with
mountains
behind
them
between
the
hills
and
the
sea
was
a
low
broad
alluvial
plain
deposited
by
an
arm
of
the
orinoco
and
by
the
other
rivers
which
run
into
the
gulf
the
palms
thrive
best
on
the
water
edge
they
stretched
for
miles
on
either
side
of
us
as
a
fringe
to
the
shore
where
the
water
was
shoal
there
were
vast
swamps
of
mangrove
the
lower
branches
covered
with
oysters
however
depressed
sugar
might
be
business
could
not
be
stagnant
ships
of
all
nations
lay
round
us
taking
in
or
discharging
cargo
i
myself
formed
for
the
time
being
part
of
the
cargo
of
my
friend
and
host
g
who
had
brought
me
to
trinidad
the
accomplished
son
of
a
brilliant
mother
himself
a
distinguished
lawyer
and
member
of
the
executive
council
of
the
island
a
charming
companion
an
invaluable
public
servant
but
with
the
temperament
of
a
man
of
genius
half
humorous
half
melancholy
which
does
not
find
itself
entirely
at
home
in
west
indian
surroundings
on
landing
we
found
ourselves
in
a
large
town
of
spain
having
been
built
by
french
and
spaniards
according
to
their
national
tendencies
and
especially
with
a
view
to
the
temperature
which
is
that
of
a
forcing
house
and
rarely
falls
below
the
streets
are
broad
and
are
planted
with
trees
for
shade
each
house
where
room
permits
having
a
garden
of
its
own
with
palms
and
mangoes
and
coffee
plants
and
creepers
of
sanitary
arrangements
there
seemed
to
be
none
there
is
abundance
of
rain
and
the
gutters
which
run
down
by
the
footway
are
flushed
almost
every
day
but
they
are
all
open
dirt
of
every
kind
lies
about
freely
to
be
washed
into
them
or
left
to
putrefy
as
fate
shall
direct
the
smell
would
not
be
pleasant
without
the
help
of
that
natural
scavenger
the
johnny
crow
a
black
vulture
who
roosts
on
the
trees
and
feeds
in
the
middle
of
the
streets
we
passed
a
dozen
of
these
unclean
but
useful
birds
in
a
fashionable
thoroughfare
gobbling
up
chicken
entrails
and
refusing
to
be
disturbed
when
gorged
they
perch
in
rows
upon
the
roofs
on
the
ground
they
are
the
nastiest
to
look
at
of
all
winged
creatures
yet
on
windy
days
they
presume
to
soar
like
their
kindred
and
when
far
up
might
be
taken
for
eagles
the
town
has
between
thirty
and
forty
thousand
people
living
in
it
and
the
rain
and
johnny
crows
between
them
keep
off
pestilence
outside
is
a
large
savannah
or
park
where
the
villas
are
of
the
successful
men
of
business
one
of
these
belonged
to
my
host
a
cool
airy
habitation
with
open
doors
and
windows
overhanging
portico
and
rooms
into
which
all
the
winds
might
enter
but
not
the
sun
a
garden
in
front
was
shut
off
from
the
savannah
by
a
fence
of
bananas
at
the
gate
stood
as
sentinel
a
cabbage
palm
a
hundred
feet
high
on
the
lawn
mangoes
oranges
papaws
and
trees
strange
to
look
at
but
luxuriantly
shady
before
the
door
was
a
tree
of
good
dimensions
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
the
stem
and
branches
of
which
were
hung
with
orchids
which
g
had
collected
in
the
woods
the
borders
were
blazing
with
varieties
of
the
single
hibiscus
crimson
pink
and
fawn
colour
the
largest
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
average
diameter
of
each
single
flower
was
from
seven
to
eight
inches
wind
streamed
freely
through
the
long
sitting
room
loaded
with
the
perfume
of
orange
trees
on
table
and
in
bookcase
the
hand
and
mind
visible
of
a
gifted
and
cultivated
man
the
particular
room
assigned
to
myself
would
have
been
equally
delightful
but
that
my
possession
of
it
was
disputed
even
in
daylight
by
mosquitoes
who
for
bloodthirsty
ferocity
had
a
bad
over
the
worst
that
i
had
ever
met
with
elsewhere
i
killed
one
who
was
at
work
upon
me
and
examined
him
through
a
glass
bewick
with
the
inspiration
of
genius
had
drawn
his
exact
likeness
as
the
devil
a
long
black
stroke
for
a
body
nick
for
neck
horns
on
the
head
and
a
beak
for
a
mouth
spindle
arms
and
longer
spindle
legs
two
pointed
wings
and
a
tail
line
for
line
there
the
figure
was
before
me
which
in
the
unforgetable
tailpiece
is
driving
the
thief
under
the
gallows
and
i
had
a
melancholy
satisfaction
in
identifying
him
i
had
been
warned
to
be
on
the
for
scorpions
centipedes
jiggers
and
land
crabs
who
would
bite
me
if
i
walked
slipperless
over
the
floor
in
the
dark
of
these
i
met
with
none
either
there
or
anywhere
but
the
mosquito
of
trinidad
is
enough
by
himself
for
malice
mockery
and
venom
of
tooth
and
trumpet
he
is
without
a
match
in
the
world
from
mosquitoes
however
one
could
seek
safety
in
tobacco
smoke
or
hide
behind
the
lace
curtains
with
which
every
bed
is
provided
otherwise
i
found
every
provision
to
make
life
pass
deliciously
to
walk
is
difficult
in
a
damp
steamy
temperature
hotter
during
daylight
than
the
hottest
forcing
house
in
kew
i
was
warned
not
to
exert
myself
and
to
take
cocktail
freely
in
the
evening
i
might
venture
out
with
the
bats
and
take
a
drive
if
i
wished
in
the
twilight
languidly
charming
as
it
all
was
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
of
what
use
such
a
possession
could
be
either
to
england
or
the
english
nation
we
could
not
colonise
it
could
not
cultivate
it
could
not
draw
a
revenue
from
it
if
it
prospered
commercially
the
prosperity
would
be
of
french
and
spaniards
mulattoes
and
blacks
but
scarcely
if
at
all
of
my
own
countrymen
for
here
too
as
elsewhere
they
were
growing
fewer
daily
and
those
who
remained
were
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
they
could
be
released
if
it
were
not
for
the
honour
of
the
thing
as
the
irishman
said
after
being
carried
in
a
sedan
chair
which
had
no
bottom
we
might
have
spared
ourselves
so
unnecessary
a
conquest
beautiful
however
it
was
beyond
dispute
before
sunset
a
carriage
took
us
round
the
savannah
tropical
human
beings
like
tropical
birds
are
fond
of
fine
colours
especially
black
human
beings
and
the
park
was
as
brilliant
as
kensington
gardens
on
a
sunday
at
nightfall
the
scene
became
yet
more
wonderful
air
grass
and
trees
being
alight
with
fireflies
each
as
brilliant
as
an
english
glowworm
the
palm
tree
at
our
own
gate
stood
like
a
ghostly
sentinel
clear
against
the
starry
sky
a
single
long
dead
frond
hanging
from
below
the
coronet
of
leaves
and
clashing
against
the
stem
as
it
was
blown
to
and
fro
by
the
night
wind
while
bats
swept
and
whistled
over
our
heads
the
commonplace
intrudes
upon
the
imaginative
at
moments
one
can
fancy
that
the
world
is
an
enchanted
place
after
all
but
then
comes
generally
an
absurd
awakening
on
the
first
night
of
my
arrival
before
we
went
to
bed
there
came
an
invitation
to
me
to
attend
a
political
meeting
which
was
to
be
held
in
a
few
days
on
the
savannah
trinidad
is
a
purely
crown
colony
and
has
escaped
hitherto
the
introduction
of
the
election
virus
the
newspapers
and
certain
busy
gentlemen
in
of
spain
had
discovered
that
they
were
living
under
degrading
tyranny
and
they
demanded
a
they
did
not
complain
that
their
affairs
had
been
ill
managed
on
the
contrary
they
insisted
that
they
were
the
most
prosperous
of
the
west
indian
colonies
and
alone
had
a
surplus
in
their
treasury
if
this
was
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
had
better
let
well
alone
the
population
all
told
was
but
less
by
thirty
thousand
than
that
of
barbadoes
they
were
a
mixed
and
motley
assemblage
of
all
races
and
colours
busy
each
with
their
own
affairs
and
never
hitherto
troubling
themselves
about
politics
but
it
had
pleased
the
home
government
to
set
up
the
beginning
of
a
constitution
again
in
jamaica
no
one
knew
why
but
so
it
was
and
trinidad
did
not
choose
to
be
behindhand
the
official
appointments
were
valuable
and
had
been
hitherto
given
away
by
the
crown
the
local
popularities
very
naturally
wished
to
have
them
for
themselves
this
was
the
reality
in
the
thing
so
far
as
there
was
a
reality
it
was
dressed
up
in
the
phrases
borrowed
from
the
great
english
masters
of
the
art
about
privileges
of
manhood
moral
dignity
the
elevating
influence
of
the
suffrage
intended
for
home
consumption
among
the
believers
in
the
orthodox
radical
faith
for
myself
i
could
but
reply
to
the
gentlemen
who
had
sent
the
invitation
that
i
was
greatly
obliged
by
the
compliment
but
that
i
knew
too
little
of
their
affairs
to
make
my
presence
of
any
value
to
them
as
they
were
doing
so
well
i
did
not
see
myself
why
they
wanted
an
alteration
political
changes
were
generally
little
more
than
turns
of
a
kaleidoscope
you
got
a
new
pattern
but
it
was
made
of
the
same
pieces
and
things
went
on
much
as
before
if
they
wanted
political
liberty
i
did
not
doubt
that
they
would
get
it
if
they
were
loud
and
persistent
enough
only
they
must
understand
that
at
home
we
were
now
a
democracy
any
constitution
which
was
granted
them
would
be
on
the
widest
basis
the
blacks
and
coolies
outnumbered
the
europeans
by
four
to
one
and
perhaps
when
they
had
what
they
asked
for
they
might
be
less
pleased
than
they
expected
you
rise
early
in
the
tropics
the
first
two
hours
of
daylight
are
the
best
of
the
day
my
friend
drove
me
round
the
town
in
his
buggy
the
next
morning
my
second
duty
was
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
governor
sir
william
robinson
who
had
kindly
offered
me
hospitality
and
for
which
i
must
present
myself
to
thank
him
in
sir
william
i
found
one
of
those
happy
men
whose
constitution
is
superior
to
climate
who
can
do
a
long
day
work
in
his
office
play
cricket
or
lawn
tennis
in
the
afternoon
and
entertain
his
miscellaneous
subjects
in
the
evening
with
sumptuous
hospitality
a
vigorous
effective
perhaps
ambitious
gentleman
with
a
clear
eye
to
the
views
of
his
employers
at
home
on
whom
his
promotion
depends
certain
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
them
likely
to
leave
his
mark
to
useful
purpose
on
the
colonies
over
which
he
presides
or
may
preside
hereafter
here
in
trinidad
he
was
learning
spanish
in
addition
to
his
other
linguistic
accomplishments
that
he
might
show
proper
courtesies
to
spanish
residents
and
to
visitors
from
south
america
the
stands
in
a
fine
situation
in
large
grounds
of
its
own
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
it
has
been
lately
built
regardless
of
expense
for
the
colony
is
rich
and
likes
to
do
things
handsomely
on
the
lawn
under
the
windows
stood
a
tree
which
was
entirely
new
to
me
an
enormous
ceiba
or
silk
cotton
tree
umbrella
shaped
fifty
yards
in
diameter
the
huge
and
buttressed
trunk
throwing
out
branches
so
massive
that
one
wondered
how
any
woody
fibre
could
bear
the
strain
of
their
weight
the
boughs
twisting
in
and
out
till
they
made
a
roof
over
head
which
was
hung
with
every
fantastic
variety
of
parasites
vast
as
the
ceibas
were
which
i
saw
afterwards
in
other
parts
of
the
west
indies
this
was
the
largest
the
ceiba
is
the
sacred
tree
of
the
negro
the
temple
of
jumbi
the
proper
home
of
obeah
to
cut
one
down
is
impious
no
black
in
his
right
mind
would
wound
even
the
bark
a
jamaica
police
officer
told
me
that
if
a
ceiba
had
to
be
removed
the
men
who
used
the
axe
were
well
dosed
with
rum
to
give
them
courage
to
defy
the
devil
from
government
house
we
strolled
into
the
adjoining
botanical
gardens
i
had
long
heard
of
the
wonders
of
these
the
reality
went
beyond
description
plants
with
which
i
was
familiar
as
in
english
conservatories
were
here
expanded
into
forest
giants
with
hundreds
of
others
of
which
we
can
not
raise
even
lilliputian
imitations
let
man
be
what
he
will
nature
in
the
tropics
is
always
grand
palms
were
growing
in
the
greatest
luxuriance
of
every
known
species
from
the
cabbage
towering
up
into
the
sky
to
the
fan
palm
of
the
desert
whose
fronds
are
reservoirs
of
water
of
exogenous
trees
the
majority
were
leguminous
in
some
shape
or
other
forming
flowers
like
a
pea
or
vetch
and
hanging
their
seed
in
pods
yet
in
shape
and
foliage
they
distanced
far
the
most
splendid
ornaments
of
an
english
park
they
had
old
world
names
with
characters
wholly
different
cedars
which
were
not
conifers
almonds
which
were
no
relations
to
peaches
and
gum
trees
as
unlike
eucalypti
as
one
tree
can
be
unlike
another
again
you
saw
forms
which
you
seemed
to
recognise
till
some
unexpected
anomaly
startled
you
out
of
your
mistake
a
gigantic
portugal
laurel
or
what
i
took
for
such
was
throwing
out
a
flower
direct
from
the
stem
like
a
cactus
grandest
among
them
all
and
happily
in
full
bloom
was
the
sacred
tree
of
burmah
the
at
a
distance
like
a
splendid
with
crimson
blossoms
in
pendant
bunches
each
separate
flower
in
the
convolution
of
its
parts
exactly
counterfeiting
a
large
orchid
with
which
it
has
not
the
faintest
affinity
the
amherstia
being
leguminous
like
the
rest
underneath
and
dispersed
among
the
imperial
beauties
were
spice
trees
orange
trees
coffee
plants
and
cocoa
or
again
shrubs
with
special
virtues
or
vices
we
had
to
be
careful
what
we
were
about
for
fruits
of
fairest
appearance
were
tempting
us
all
round
my
companion
was
preparing
to
eat
something
to
encourage
me
to
do
the
same
a
gardener
stopped
him
in
time
it
was
nux
vomica
i
was
straying
along
a
less
frequented
path
conscious
of
a
heavy
vaporous
odour
in
which
i
might
have
fainted
had
i
remained
exposed
to
it
i
was
close
to
a
manchineel
tree
prettiest
and
freshest
were
the
nutmegs
which
had
a
glen
all
to
themselves
and
perfumed
the
surrounding
air
in
trinidad
and
in
grenada
i
believe
the
nutmegs
are
the
largest
that
are
known
being
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
high
leaves
brilliant
green
something
like
the
leaves
of
an
orange
but
extremely
delicate
and
thin
folded
one
over
the
other
the
lowest
branches
sweeping
to
the
ground
till
the
whole
tree
forms
a
natural
bower
which
is
proof
against
a
tropical
shower
the
fragrance
attracts
moths
and
flies
not
mosquitoes
who
prefer
a
ranker
atmosphere
i
saw
a
pair
of
butterflies
the
match
of
which
i
do
not
remember
even
in
any
museum
dark
blue
shot
with
green
like
a
neck
and
the
size
of
english
bats
i
asked
a
black
boy
to
catch
me
one
sort
no
let
catchee
massa
he
said
and
i
was
penitently
glad
to
hear
it
among
the
wonders
of
the
gardens
are
the
vines
as
they
call
them
that
is
the
creepers
of
various
kinds
that
climb
about
the
other
trees
standing
in
an
open
space
there
was
what
once
had
been
a
mighty
it
was
now
dead
only
the
trunk
and
dead
branches
remaining
and
had
been
murdered
by
a
vine
which
had
started
from
the
root
twined
itself
like
a
python
round
the
stem
strangled
out
the
natural
life
and
spreading
out
in
all
directions
had
covered
boughs
and
twigs
with
a
foliage
not
their
own
so
far
the
had
done
no
worse
than
ivy
does
at
home
but
there
was
one
feature
about
it
which
puzzled
me
altogether
the
lowest
of
the
original
branches
of
the
cedar
were
about
twenty
feet
above
our
heads
from
these
in
four
or
five
places
the
parasite
had
let
fall
shoots
perhaps
an
inch
in
diameter
which
descended
to
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
and
then
suddenly
without
touching
that
or
anything
formed
a
bight
like
a
rope
went
straight
up
again
caught
hold
of
the
branch
from
which
they
started
and
so
hung
suspended
exactly
as
an
ordinary
swing
in
three
distinctly
perfect
instances
the
had
executed
this
singular
evolution
while
at
the
extremity
of
one
of
the
longest
and
tallest
branches
high
up
in
the
air
it
had
made
a
clean
leap
of
fifteen
feet
without
visible
help
and
had
caught
hold
of
another
tree
adjoining
on
the
same
level
these
performances
were
so
inexplicable
that
i
conceived
that
they
must
have
been
a
freak
of
the
gardener
i
was
mistaken
he
said
that
at
particular
times
in
the
year
the
fig
vine
threw
out
fine
tendrils
which
hung
downwards
like
strings
the
strongest
among
them
would
lay
hold
of
two
or
three
others
and
climb
up
upon
them
the
rest
would
die
and
drop
off
while
the
successful
one
having
found
support
for
itself
above
would
remain
swinging
in
the
air
and
thicken
and
prosper
the
leap
he
explained
by
the
wind
i
retained
a
suspicion
that
the
wind
had
been
assisted
by
some
aspiring
energy
in
the
plant
itself
so
bold
it
was
and
so
ambitious
but
the
wonders
of
the
garden
were
thrown
into
the
shade
by
the
cottage
at
the
extreme
angle
of
it
the
old
government
house
before
the
present
fabric
had
been
erected
where
kingsley
had
been
the
guest
of
sir
arthur
gordon
it
is
a
long
straggling
wooden
building
with
deep
verandahs
lying
in
a
hollow
overshadowed
by
trees
with
views
opening
out
into
the
savannah
through
arches
formed
by
clumps
of
tall
bamboos
the
canes
growing
thick
in
circular
masses
and
shooting
up
a
hundred
feet
into
the
air
where
they
meet
and
form
frames
for
the
landscape
peculiar
and
even
picturesque
when
there
are
not
too
many
of
them
these
bamboos
were
kingsley
special
delight
as
he
had
never
seen
the
like
of
them
elsewhere
the
room
in
which
he
wrote
is
still
shown
and
the
gallery
where
he
walked
up
and
down
with
his
long
pipe
his
memory
is
cherished
in
the
island
as
of
some
singular
and
beautiful
presence
which
still
hovers
about
the
scenes
which
so
delighted
him
in
the
closing
evening
of
his
own
life
it
was
the
dry
season
yet
raining
every
day
for
two
or
three
hours
and
when
it
rains
in
these
countries
it
means
business
when
the
sky
cleared
the
sun
was
intolerably
hot
and
distant
expeditions
under
such
conditions
suited
neither
my
age
nor
my
health
with
cocktail
i
might
have
ventured
but
to
cocktail
i
could
never
heartily
reconcile
myself
trinidad
has
one
wonder
in
it
a
lake
of
bitumen
some
ninety
acres
in
extent
which
all
travellers
are
expected
to
visit
and
which
few
residents
care
to
visit
a
black
lake
is
not
so
beautiful
as
an
ordinary
lake
i
had
no
doubt
that
it
existed
for
the
testimony
was
unimpeachable
indeed
i
was
shown
an
actual
specimen
of
the
crystallised
pitch
itself
i
could
believe
without
seeing
and
without
undertaking
a
tedious
journey
i
rather
sympathised
with
a
noble
lord
who
came
to
port
of
spain
in
his
yacht
and
like
myself
had
the
lake
impressed
upon
him
as
a
middle
course
between
going
thither
and
appearing
to
slight
his
friends
recommendations
he
said
that
he
would
send
his
steward
in
trinidad
as
everywhere
else
my
own
chief
desire
was
to
see
the
human
inhabitants
to
learn
what
they
were
doing
how
they
were
living
and
what
they
were
thinking
about
and
this
could
best
be
done
by
drives
about
the
town
and
neighbourhood
the
cultivated
land
is
a
mere
fringe
round
the
edges
of
the
forest
of
the
soil
are
untouched
the
rivers
running
out
of
the
mountains
have
carved
out
the
usual
long
deep
valleys
and
spread
the
bottoms
with
rich
alluvial
soil
here
among
the
wooded
slopes
are
the
country
houses
of
the
merchants
here
are
the
cabins
of
the
black
peasantry
with
their
cocoa
and
coffee
and
orange
plantations
which
as
in
grenada
they
hold
largely
as
freeholds
reproducing
as
near
as
possible
the
life
in
paradise
of
our
first
parents
without
the
consciousness
of
a
want
which
they
are
unable
to
gratify
not
compelled
to
work
for
the
earth
of
her
own
self
bears
for
them
all
that
they
need
and
ignorant
that
there
is
any
difference
between
moral
good
and
evil
large
sugar
estates
of
course
there
still
are
and
as
the
owners
have
not
succeeded
in
bringing
the
negroes
to
work
regularly
for
them
they
have
introduced
a
few
thousand
coolies
under
indentures
for
five
years
these
asiatic
importations
are
very
happy
in
trinidad
they
save
money
and
many
of
them
do
not
return
home
when
their
time
is
out
but
stay
where
they
are
buy
land
or
go
into
trade
they
are
proud
however
and
will
not
intermarry
with
the
africans
few
bring
their
families
with
them
and
women
being
scanty
among
them
there
arise
inconveniences
and
sometimes
serious
crimes
it
were
to
be
wished
that
there
was
more
prospect
of
the
coolie
race
becoming
permanent
than
i
fear
there
is
they
work
excellently
they
are
picturesque
additions
to
the
landscape
as
they
keep
to
the
bright
colours
and
graceful
drapery
of
india
the
grave
dignity
of
their
faces
contrasts
remarkably
with
the
broad
but
common
features
of
the
african
the
black
women
look
with
envy
at
the
straight
hair
of
asia
and
twist
their
unhappy
wool
into
knots
and
ropes
in
the
vain
hope
of
being
mistaken
for
the
purer
race
but
this
is
all
the
african
and
the
asiatic
will
not
mix
and
the
african
being
the
stronger
will
and
must
prevail
in
trinidad
as
elsewhere
in
the
west
indies
out
of
a
total
population
of
there
are
whites
and
mulattoes
coolies
the
rest
negroes
the
english
part
of
the
europeans
shows
no
tendency
to
increase
the
english
come
as
birds
of
passage
and
depart
when
they
have
made
their
fortunes
the
french
and
spaniards
may
hold
on
to
trinidad
as
a
home
our
people
do
not
make
homes
there
and
must
be
looked
on
as
a
transient
element

the
second
morning
after
my
arrival
my
host
took
me
to
a
coolie
village
three
miles
beyond
the
town
the
drive
was
between
spreading
cane
fields
beneath
the
shade
of
bamboos
or
under
rows
of
palms
between
the
stems
of
which
the
sea
was
gleaming
human
dwelling
places
are
rarely
interesting
in
the
tropics
a
roof
which
will
keep
the
rain
out
is
all
that
is
needed
the
more
free
the
passage
given
to
the
air
under
the
floor
and
through
the
side
the
more
healthy
the
habitation
and
the
houses
when
we
came
among
them
seemed
merely
enlarged
packing
cases
loosely
nailed
together
and
raised
on
stones
a
foot
or
two
from
the
ground
the
rest
of
the
scene
was
picturesque
enough
the
indian
jewellers
were
sitting
before
their
charcoal
pans
making
silver
bracelets
and
earrings
brilliant
garments
crimson
and
blue
and
orange
were
hanging
to
dry
on
clothes
lines
men
were
going
out
to
their
work
women
cooking
children
not
many
playing
or
munching
sugar
cane
while
great
mango
trees
and
ceibas
spread
a
cool
green
roof
over
all
like
rachel
the
coolies
had
brought
their
gods
to
their
new
home
in
the
centre
of
the
village
was
a
hindoo
temple
made
up
rudely
out
of
boards
with
a
verandah
running
round
it
the
doors
were
locked
an
old
man
who
had
charge
told
us
we
could
not
enter
a
crowd
suspicious
and
sullen
gathered
about
us
as
we
tried
to
prevail
upon
him
so
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
the
outside
which
was
gaudily
and
not
unskilfully
painted
in
indian
fashion
there
were
gods
and
goddesses
in
various
attitudes
vishnu
fighting
with
the
monkey
god
vishnu
with
cutlass
and
shield
the
monkey
with
his
tail
round
one
tree
while
he
brandished
two
others
one
in
each
hand
as
clubs
i
suppose
that
we
smiled
for
our
curiosity
was
resented
and
we
found
it
prudent
to
withdraw
the
coolies
are
useful
creatures
without
them
sugar
cultivation
in
trinidad
and
demerara
would
cease
altogether
they
are
useful
and
they
are
singularly
ornamental
unfortunately
they
have
not
the
best
character
with
the
police
there
is
little
crime
among
the
negroes
who
quarrel
furiously
with
their
tongues
only
the
coolies
have
the
fiercer
passions
of
their
eastern
blood
their
women
being
few
are
tempted
occasionally
into
infidelities
and
would
be
tempted
more
often
but
that
a
lapse
in
virtue
is
so
fearfully
avenged
a
coolie
regards
his
wife
as
his
property
and
if
she
is
unfaithful
to
him
he
kills
her
without
the
least
hesitation
one
of
the
judges
told
me
that
he
had
tried
a
case
of
this
kind
and
could
not
make
the
man
understand
that
he
had
done
anything
wrong
it
is
a
pity
that
a
closer
intermixture
between
them
and
the
negroes
seems
so
hopeless
for
it
would
solve
many
difficulties
there
is
no
jealousy
the
negro
does
not
regard
the
coolie
as
a
competitor
and
interloper
who
has
come
to
lower
his
wages
the
coolie
comes
to
work
the
negro
does
not
want
to
work
and
both
are
satisfied
but
if
there
is
no
jealousy
there
is
no
friendship
the
two
races
are
more
absolutely
apart
than
the
white
and
the
black
the
asiatic
insists
the
more
on
his
superiority
in
the
fear
perhaps
that
if
he
did
not
the
white
might
forget
it
among
the
sights
in
the
neighbourhood
of
port
of
spain
are
the
waterworks
extensive
basins
and
reservoirs
a
few
miles
off
in
the
hills
we
chose
a
cool
afternoon
when
the
temperature
in
the
shade
was
not
above
and
went
to
look
at
them
it
was
my
first
sight
of
the
interior
of
the
island
and
my
first
distinct
acquaintance
with
the
change
which
had
come
over
the
west
indies
trinidad
is
not
one
of
our
oldest
possessions
but
we
had
held
it
long
enough
for
the
old
planter
civilisation
to
take
root
and
grow
and
our
road
led
us
through
jungles
of
flowering
shrubs
which
were
running
wild
over
what
had
been
once
cultivated
estates
stranger
still
for
one
associates
colonial
life
instinctively
with
what
is
new
and
modern
we
came
at
one
place
on
an
avenue
of
vast
trees
at
the
end
of
which
stood
the
ruins
of
a
mansion
of
some
great
man
of
the
departed
order
great
man
he
must
have
been
for
there
was
a
gateway
half
crumbled
away
on
which
were
his
crest
and
shield
in
stone
with
supporters
on
either
side
like
the
baron
of
bradwardine
bears
fallen
now
like
them
but
unlike
them
never
i
fear
to
be
set
up
again
the
indians
like
the
english
gentry
in
ireland
were
a
fine
race
of
men
in
their
day
and
perhaps
the
improving
them
off
the
earth
has
been
a
less
beneficial
process
in
either
case
than
we
are
in
the
habit
of
supposing
entering
among
the
hills
we
came
on
their
successors
in
trinidad
there
are
freeholders
most
of
them
negroes
and
representatives
of
the
old
slaves
their
cabins
are
spread
along
the
road
on
either
side
overhung
with
trees
tamarinds
calabash
trees
out
of
which
they
make
their
cups
and
water
jugs
the
luscious
granadilla
climbs
among
the
branches
plantains
throw
their
cool
shade
over
the
doors
oranges
and
limes
and
citrons
perfume
the
air
and
droop
their
boughs
under
the
weight
of
their
golden
burdens
there
were
yams
in
the
gardens
and
cows
in
the
paddocks
and
cocoa
bushes
loaded
with
purple
or
yellow
pods
children
played
about
in
swarms
in
happy
idleness
and
abundance
with
schools
too
at
intervals
and
an
occasional
catholic
chapel
for
the
old
religion
prevails
in
trinidad
never
having
been
disturbed
what
form
could
human
life
assume
more
charming
than
that
which
we
were
now
looking
on
once
more
the
earth
does
not
contain
any
peasantry
so
well
off
so
well
cared
for
so
happy
so
sleek
and
contented
as
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
emancipated
slaves
in
the
english
west
indian
islands
sugar
may
fail
the
planter
but
cocoa
which
each
peasant
can
grow
with
small
effort
for
himself
does
not
fail
and
will
not
he
may
his
condition
if
he
has
any
such
ambition
without
stirring
beyond
his
own
ground
and
so
far
perhaps
his
ambition
may
extend
if
it
is
not
turned
off
upon
politics
even
the
necessary
evils
of
the
tropics
are
not
many
or
serious
his
skin
is
proof
against
mosquitoes
there
are
snakes
in
trinidad
as
there
were
snakes
in
eden
snakes
said
one
of
them
who
was
at
work
in
his
garden
snakes
but
no
bitee
as
to
costume
he
would
prefer
the
costume
of
innocence
if
he
was
allowed
clothes
in
such
a
climate
are
superfluous
for
warmth
and
to
the
minds
of
the
negroes
unconscious
as
they
are
of
shame
superfluous
for
decency
european
prejudice
however
still
passes
for
something
the
women
have
a
love
for
finery
which
would
prevent
a
complete
return
to
african
simplicity
and
in
the
islands
which
are
still
french
and
in
those
like
trinidad
which
the
french
originally
colonised
they
dress
themselves
with
real
taste
they
hide
their
wool
in
red
or
yellow
handkerchiefs
gracefully
twisted
or
perhaps
it
is
not
only
to
conceal
the
wool
columbus
found
the
carib
women
of
the
island
dressing
their
hair
in
the

fashion

waterworks
when

reached
them
were
even
more
beautiful
than
we
had
been
taught
to
expect
a
dam
has
been
driven
across
a
perfectly
limpid
mountain
stream
a
wide
open
area
has
been
cleared
levelled
strengthened
with
masonry
and
divided
into
deep
basins
and
reservoirs
through
which
the
current
continually
flows
hedges
of
hibiscus
shine
with
crimson
blossoms
innumerable
humming
birds
glance
to
and
fro
among
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
gardens
and
ponds
are
overhung
by
magnificent
bamboos
which
so
astonished
me
by
their
size
that
i
inquired
if
their
height
had
been
measured
one
of
them
i
was
told
had
lately
fallen
and
was
found
to
be
feet
long
a
single
drawback
only
there
was
to
this
enchanting
spot
and
it
was
again
the
snakes
there
are
huge
pythons
in
trinidad
which
are
supposed
to
have
crossed
the
straits
from
the
continent
the
cool
water
pools
attract
them
and
they
are
seen
occasionally
coiled
among
the
branches
of
the
bamboos
some
washerwomen
at
work
in
the
stream
had
been
disturbed
a
few
days
before
our
visit
by
one
of
these
monsters
who
had
come
down
to
see
what
they
were
about
they
are
harmless
but
trying
to
the
nerves
one
of
the
men
about
the
place
shot
this
one
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
shot
another
a
short
time
before
asleep
in
a
tree
the
keeper
of
the
works
was
a
retired
soldier
an
from
limerick
hale
vigorous
and
happy
as
the
blacks
themselves
he
had
married
one
of
them
a
remarkable
exception
to
an
almost
universal
rule
he
did
not
introduce
us
but
the
dark
lady
passed
by
us
in
gorgeous
costume
just
noticing
our
presence
with
a
sweep
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
duchess
we
made
several

lord
rodney
says
have
been
often
in

the

islands
and
i
have
often
made
my
observations
on
the
treatment
of
the
negro
slaves
and
can
aver
that
i
never
knew
the
least
cruelty
inflicted
on
them
but
that
in
general
they
lived
better
than
the
honest
man
in
england
without
doing
a
fourth
part
of
his
work
in
a
day
and
i
am
fully
convinced
that
the
negroes
in
our
islands
are
better
provided
for
and
live
better
than
when
in
guinea
rodney
it
is
true
was
a
man
of
facts
and
was
defective
in
sentiment
let
us
suppose
him
wrong
let
us
believe
the
worst
horrors
of
the
slave
trade
or
slave
usage
as
fluent
tongue
of
missionary
or
demagogue
has
described
them
yet
nevertheless
when
we
consider
what
the
lot
of
common
humanity
has
been
and
is
we
shall
be
dishonest
if
we
deny
that
the
balance
has
been
more
than
redressed
and
the
negroes
who
were
taken
away
out
of
africa
as
compared
with
those
who
were
left
at
home
were
as
the
to
salvation
who
after
a
brief
purgatory
are
secured
an
eternity
of
blessedness
the
one
condition
is
the
maintenance
of
the
authority
of
the
english
crown
the
whites
of
the
islands
can
not
equitably
rule
them
they
have
not
shaken
off
the
old
traditions
if
for
the
sake
of
theory
or
to
shirk
responsibility
we
force
them
to
govern
themselves
the
state
of
hayti
stands
as
a
ghastly
example
of
the
condition
into
which
they
will
then
inevitably
fall
if
we
persist
we
shall
be
sinning
against
light
the
clearest
light
that
was
ever
given
in
such
affairs
the
most
hardened
believers
in
the
regenerating
effects
of
political
liberty
can
not
be
completely
blind
to
the
ruin
which
the
infliction
of
it
would
necessarily
bring
upon
the
race
for
whose
interests
they
pretend
particularly
to
care
the

i
resisted
all
exhortations
to

but
the
days
in
the
forest
were
delightful
a
day
which
we
spent
at
the
basin
a
pool
scooped
out
in
the
course
of
ages
by
a
river
falling
through
a
mountain
gorge
blue
not
from
any
colour
in
the
water
which
is
purely
transparent
but
from
a
peculiar
effect
of
sky
reflection
through
an
opening
in
the
overhanging
trees
as
it
was
far
off
we
had
to
start
early
and
encounter
the
noonday
heat
we
had
to
close
the
curtains
of
the
carriage
to
escape
the
sun
and
in
losing
the
sun
we
shut
out
the
wind
all
was
well
however
when
we
turned
into
the
hills
thenceforward
the
road
followed
the
bottom
of
a
densely
wooded
ravine
impenetrable
foliage
spreading
over
our
heads
and
a
limpid
river
flashing
along
in
which
our
horses
cooled
their
feet
and
lips
as
we
crossed
it
again
and
again
there
were
the
usual
cabins
and
gardens
on
either
side
of
us
sometimes
single
sometimes
clustering
into
villages
and
high
above
them
the
rocks
stood
out
broken
into
precipices
or
jutting
out
into
projecting
crags
with
huge
trees
starting
from
the
crevices
dead
trunks
with
branching
arms
clothed
scantily
with
creepers
or
living

the

their

waved
their
long
broad
leaves
some
flat
and
unbroken
as
we
know
them
in

some
split
into

quivered
in

the
cocoa

were
ripe

which
had
been
gathered

left
on
the

in

as
we
see
apples
in
autumn
in
an
english

we
passed
a

on
the

who
was
making
sketches
and
daring
the
mosquitoes
that
were
feeding
at
leisure
upon
her

us

alighted
with

for
their
natural
language
but
with
english
enough
to
earn
shillings
and
amuse
the
british
tourist
with
their
help
we
scrambled
along
a
steep
slippery
path
the
river
roaring
below
till
we
came
to
a
spot
where
the
rock
being
soft
a
waterfall
had
cut
out
in
the
course
of
ages
a
natural
hollow
of
which
the
trees
formed
the
roof
and
of
which
the
floor
was
the
pool
we
had
come
in
search
of
the
fall
itself
was
perpendicular
and
fifty
or
sixty
feet
high
the
water
issuing
at
the
top
out
of
a
dark
green
tunnel
among
overhanging
branches
the
sides
of
the
basin
were
draped
with
the
fronds
of
gigantic
ferns
and
wild
plantains
all
in
wild
luxuriance
and
dripping
with
the
spray
in
clefts
above
the
rocks
large
cedars
or
gum
trees
had
struck
their
roots
and
flung
out
their
gnarled
and
twisted
branches
which
were
hung
with
ferns
while
at
the
lower
end
of
the
pool
where
the
river
left
it
again
there
grew
out
from
among

the

broke
on
us
suddenly
as
we
scrambled
round
a
corner
from
below
three
young
blacks
were
bathing
in
the
pool
and
as
we
had
a
lady
with
us
they
were
induced
though
sullenly
and
with
some
difficulty
to
return
into
their
scanty
garments
and
depart
never
certainly
was
there
a
more
inviting
spot
to
swim
in
the
more
so
from
exciting
possibilities
of
adventure
an
english
gentleman
went
to
bathe
there
shortly
before
our
coming
he
was
on
a
rock
swaying
his
body
for
a
plunge
when
something
caught
his
eye
among
the
shadows
at
the
bottom
it
proved
to
be
a
large
dead
python
we
had
not
the
luck
ourselves
of
falling
in
with
so
interesting
a
beast
great
butterflies
and
perhaps
a
humming
bird
or
two
were
flitting
among
the
leaves
as
we
came
up
other
signs
of
life
there
were
none
unless
we
call
life
the
motion
of
the
plantain
leaves
waving
in
the
draughts
of
air
which
were
eddying
round
the
waterfall
we
sat
down
on
stones
or
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
the
mosquitoes
mercifully
sparing
us
we
sketched
a
little
talked
a
little
ate
our
sandwiches
and
the
male
part
of
us
lighted
our
cigars
g
then
to
my
surprise
produced
a
fly
rod
in
the
streams
in
the
antilles
which
run
out
of
the
mountains
there
is
a
fish
in
great
abundance
which
they
call
an
inferior
trout
but
a
good
substitute
where
the
real
thing
is
not
he
runs
sometimes
to
five
pounds
weight
will
take
the
fly
and
is
much
sought
after
by
those
who
try
to
preserve
in
the
tropics
the
amusements
and
habits
of
home
g
had
caught
many
of
them
in
dominica
if
in
dominica
why
not
in
trinidad
he
put
his
tackle
together
tied
up
a
cast
of
trout
flies
and
commenced
work
he
tried
the
still
water
at
the
lower
end
of
the
basin
he
crept
round
the
rock
and
dropped
his
line
into
the
foam
at
the
foot
of
the
fall
no
mullet
rose
nor
fish
of
any
kind
one
of
our
small
boys
had
looked
on
with
evident
impatience
he
cried
out
at
last
mullet
but
plenty
crayfish
pointing
down
into
the
water
and
there
following
the
direction
of
his
finger
we
beheld
strange
grey
creatures
like
moving
about
on
the
points
of
their
toes
the
size
of
small
lobsters
the
flies
were
dismounted
a
bare
hook
was
fitted
on
a
fine
gut
trace
with
a
split
shot
or
two
to
sink
the
line
all
trim
and
excellent
a
shrimp
was
caught
under
a
stone
for
a
bait
g
went
to
work
and
the
strange
things
took
hold
and
let
themselves
be
lifted
halfway
to
the
surface
but
then
somehow
they
let
go
and
disappeared
our
small
boy
said
nothing
but
i
saw
a
scornful
smite
upon
his
lips
he
picked
up
a
thin
dry
cane
found
some
twine
in
the
luncheon
basket
which
had
tied
up
our
sandwiches
found
a
pin
there
also
and
bent
it
and
put
a
shrimp
on
it
with
a
pebble
stone
for
a
sinker
he
started
in
competition
and
in
a
minute
he
had
brought
out
upon
the
rock
the
strangest
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
fish
which
i
had
ever
seen
in
fresh
water
or
salt
it
was
a
true
eight
inches
long
formed
regularly
with
the
thick
powerful
tail
the
sharp
serrated
snout
the
long
antennæ
and
the
legs
of
the
lobster
tribe
as
in
a
crayfish
the
claws
were
represented
by
the
correctly
shaped
but
diminutive
substitutes
when
we
had
done
wondering
at
the
prize
we
could
admire
the
smile
of
conscious
superiority
in
the
face
of
the
captor
the
fine
tackle
had
been
beaten
as
usual
by
the
proverbial
string
and
crooked
pin
backed
by
knowledge
in
the
head
of
a
small

several

persons
must
have
attended
not
all
to
hear
the
oratory
for
the
occasion
had
been
taken
when
the
governor
was
to
play
close
by
in
a
cricket
match
and
half
the
crowd
had
probably
collected
to
see
his
excellency
at

placards
had
been
posted
about
the

setting
out

purpose
of
the

trinidad
as
i
said
is
at
present
a
crown
colony
the
executive
council
and
the
legislature
being
equally
nominated
by
the
authorities
the
popular
orators
the
newspaper
writers
and
some
of
the
leading
merchants
in
port
of
spain
had
discovered
as
i
said
that
they
were
living
under
what
they
called
degrading
tyranny
they
had
no
grievances
or
none
that
they
alleged
beyond
the
general
one
that
they
had
no
control
over
the
finance
they
very
naturally
desired
that
the
lucrative
government
appointments
for
which
the
colony
paid
should
be
distributed
among
themselves
the
elective
principle
had
been
reintroduced
in
jamaica
evidently
as
a
step
towards
the
restoration
of
the
full
constitution
which
had
been
surrendered
and
suppressed
after
the
gordon
riots
trinidad
was
almost
as
large
as
jamaica
in
proportion
to
the
population
wealthier
and
more
prosperous
and
the
people
were
invited
to
come
together
in
overwhelming
numbers
to
insist
that
the
should
end
the
home
government
in
their
action
about
jamaica
had
shown
a
spontaneous
readiness
to
transfer
responsibility
from
themselves
to
the
inhabitants
the
promoters
of
the
meeting
at
port
of
spain
may
have
thought
that
a
little
pressure
on
their
part
might
not
be
unwelcome
as
an
excuse
for
further
concessions
of
the
same
kind
whether
this
was
so
i
do
not
know
at
any
rate
they
showed
that
they
were
as
yet
novices
in
the
art
of
agitation
the
language
of
the
placard
of
invitation
was
so
violent
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
legal
authorities
the
printer
might
have
been
indicted
for
high
treason
the
speakers
did
their
best
to
imitate
the
fine
phrases
of
the
apostles
of
liberty
in
europe
but
they
succeeded
only
in
caricaturing
their
absurdities
the
proceedings
were
described
at
length
in
the
rival
newspapers
one
gentleman
speech
was
said
to
have
been
so
brilliant
that
every
sentence
was
a
of
oratory
the
gem
of
gems
being
when
he
told
his
hearers
that
they
went
into
the
thing
at
all
they
should
go
the
entire
animal
all
went
off
in
the
liberal
journal
the
event
of
the
day
was
spoken
of
as
the
most
magnificent
demonstration
in
favour
of
human
freedom
which
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
west
indian
islands
in
the
conservative
journal
it
was
called
a
ridiculous
and
the
people
were
said
to
have
come
together
only
to
admire
the
governor
batting
and
to
laugh
at
the
nonsense
which
was
coming
from
the
platform
finally
the
same
journal
assured
us
that
beyond
a
handful
of
people
who
were
interested
in
getting
hold
of
the
anticipated
spoils
of
office
no
one
in
the
island
cared
about
the
matter
the
result
i
believe
was
some
petition
or
other
which
would
go
home
and
pass
as
evidence
to
minds
eager
to
believe
that
trinidad
was
rapidly
ripening
for
responsible
government
promising
relief
to
an
overburdened
secretary
for
the
colonies
who
has
more
to
do
than
he
can
attend
to
and
is
pleased
with
opportunities
of
gratifying
popular
sentiment
or
of
showing
off
in
parliament
the
development
of
colonial
institutions
he
knows
nothing
can
know
nothing
of
the
special
conditions
of
our
hundred
dependencies
he
accepts
what
his
representatives
in
the
several
colonies
choose
to
tell
him
and
his
representatives
being
birds
of
passage
responsible
only
to
their
employers
at
home
and
depending
for
their
promotion
on
making
themselves
agreeable
are
under
irresistible
temptations
to
report
what
it
will
please
the
secretary
of
state
to
hear
for
the
secretary
of
state
too
is
a
bird
of
passage
as
they
are
passing
through
the
colonial
office
on
his
way
to
other
departments
or
holding
the
seals
as
part
of
an
administration
whose
tenure
of
office
grows
every
year
more
precarious
which
exists
only
upon
popular
sentiment
and
can
not
and
does
not
try
to
look
forward
beyond
at
furthest
the
next
session
of
parliament
but
why
it
may
be
asked
should
not
trinidad
govern
itself
as
well
as
tasmania
or
new
zealand
why
not
jamaica
why
not
all
the
west
indian
islands
i
will
answer
by
another
question
do
we
wish
these
islands
to
remain
as
part
of
the
british
empire
are
they
of
any
use
to
us
or
have
we
responsibilities
connected
with
them
of
which
we
are
not
entitled
to
divest
ourselves
a
government
elected
by
the
majority
of
the
people
and
no
one
would
think
of
setting
up
constitutions
on
any
other
basis
reflects
from
the
nature
of
things
the
character
of
the
electors
all
these
islands
tend
to
become
partitioned
into
black
peasant
proprietaries
in
grenada
the
process
is
almost
complete
in
trinidad
it
is
rapidly
advancing
no
one
can
stop
it
no
one
ought
to
wish
to
stop
it
but
the
ownership
of
freeholds
is
one
thing
and
political
power
is
another
the
blacks
depend
for
the
progress
which
they
may
be
capable
of
making
on
the
presence
of
a
white
community
among
them
and
although
it
is
undesirable
or
impossible
for
the
blacks
to
be
ruled
by
the
minority
of
the
white
residents
it
is
equally
undesirable
and
equally
impossible
that
the
whites
should
be
ruled
by
them
the
relative
numbers
of
the
two
races
being
what
they
are
responsible
government
in
trinidad
means
government
by
a
black
parliament
and
a
black
ministry
the
negro
voters
might
elect
to
begin
with
their
attorneys
or
such
whites
the
most
disreputable
of
their
colour
as
would
court
their
suffrages
but
the
black
does
not
love
the
mulatto
and
despises
the
white
man
who
consents
to
be
his
servant
he
has
no
grievances
he
is
not
naturally
a
politician
and
if
left
alone
with
his
own
patch
of
land
will
never
trouble
himself
to
look
further
but
he
knows
what
has
happened
in
domingo
he
has
heard
that
his
race
is
already
in
full
possession
of
the
finest
of
all
the
islands
if
he
has
any
thought
or
any
hopes
about
the
matter
it
is
that
it
may
be
with
the
rest
of
them
as
it
has
been
with
domingo
and
if
you
force
the
power
into
his
hands
you
must
expect
him
to
use
it
under
the
constitution
which
you
would
set
up
whites
and
blacks
may
be
nominally
equal
but
from
the
enormous
preponderance
of
numbers
the
equality
would
be
only
in
name
and
such
english
people
at
least
as
would
be
really
of
any
value
would
refuse
to
remain
in
a
false
and
intolerable
position
already
the
english
population
of
trinidad
is
dwindling
away
under
the
uncertainties
of
their
future
position
complete
the
work
set
up
a
constitution
with
a
black
prime
minister
and
a
black
legislature
and
they
will
withdraw
of
themselves
before
they
are
compelled
to
go
spaniards
and
french
might
be
tempted
by
advantages
of
trade
to
remain
in
port
of
spain
as
a
few
are
still
to
be
found
in
hayti
they
it
is
possible
might
in
time
recover
and
reassert
their
supremacy
englishmen
have
the
world
open
to
them
and
will
prefer
lands
where
they
can
live
under
less
degrading
conditions
in
hayti
the
black
republic
allows
no
white
man
to
hold
land
in
freehold
the
blacks
elsewhere
with
the
same
opportunities
will
develop
the
same
aspirations
do
we
or
do
we
not
intend
to
retain
our
west
indian
islands
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
queen
if
we
are
willing
to
let
them
go
the
question
is
settled
but
we
ought
to
face
the
alternative
there
is
but
one
form
of
government
under
which
we
can
retain
these
colonies
with
honour
and
security
to
ourselves
and
with
advantage
to
the
negroes
whom
we
have
placed
there
the
mode
of
government
which
succeeds
with
us
so
admirably
that
it
is
the
world
wonder
in
the
indies
a
success
so
unique
and
so
extraordinary
that
it
seems
the
last
from
which
we
are
willing
to
take
example
in
natal
where
the
circumstances
are
analogous
and
where
report
says
that
efforts
are
being
also
made
to
force
on
constitutional
independence
i
remember
suggesting
a
few
years
ago
that
the
governor
should
be
allowed
to
form
his
own
council
and
that
in
selecting
the
members
of
it
he
should
go
round
the
colony
observe
the
farms
where
the
land
was
well
inclosed
the
fields
clean
the
farm
buildings
substantial
and
in
good
repair
that
he
should
call
on
the
owners
of
these
to
be
his
advisers
and
assistants
in
all
natal
he
might
find
a
dozen
such
they
would
be
unwilling
to
leave
their
own
business
for
so
thankless
a
purpose
but
they
might
be
induced
by
good
feeling
to
grant
him
a
few
weeks
of
their
time
under
such
an
administration
i
imagine
natal
would
have
a
happier
future
before
it
than
it
will
experience
with
the
boon
which
is
designed
for
it
in
the
west
indies
there
is
indefinite
wealth
waiting
to
be
developed
by
intelligence
and
capital
and
men
with
such
resources
both
english
and
american
might
be
tempted
still
to
settle
there
and
lead
the
blacks
along
with
them
into
more
settled
manners
and
higher
forms
of
civilisation
but
the
future
of
the
blacks
and
our
own
influence
over
them
for
good
depend
on
their
being
protected
from
themselves
and
from
the
schemers
who
would
take
advantage
of
them
however
little
may
be
the
share
to
which
the
mass
of
a
population
be
admitted
in
the
government
of
their
country
they
are
never
found
hard
to
manage
where
they
prosper
and
are
justly
dealt
with
the
children
of
darkness
are
even
easier
of
control
than
the
children
of
light
under
an
administration
formed
on
the
model
of
that
of
our
eastern
empire
these
islands
would
be
peopled
in
a
generation
or
two
with
dusky
citizens
as
proud
as
the
rest
of
us
of
the
flag
under
which
they
will
have
thriven
and
as
willing
to
defend
it
against
any
invading
enemy
as
they
are
now
unquestionably
indifferent
partially
elected
councils
local
elected
boards
serve
only
as
contrivances
to
foster
discontent
and
encourage
jobbery
they
open
a
rift
which
time
will
widen
and
which
will
create
for
us
on
a
smaller
scale
the
conditions
which
have
so
troubled
us
in
ireland
where
each
concession
of
popular
demands
makes
the
maintenance
of
the
connection
more
difficult
in
the
pacific
colonies
is
a
natural
right
the
colonists
are
part
of
ourselves
and
have
as
complete
a
claim
to
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
as
we
have
to
the
management
of
ours
the
less
we
interfere
with
them
the
more
heartily
they
identify
themselves
with
us
but
if
we
choose
besides
to
indulge
our
ambition
with
an
empire
if
we
determine
to
keep
attached
to
our
dominion
countries
which
like
the
east
indies
have
been
conquered
by
the
sword
countries
like
the
west
indies
which
however
acquired
are
occupied
by
races
enormously
outnumbering
us
many
of
whom
do
not
speak
our
language
are
not
connected
with
us
by
sentiment
and
not
visibly
connected
by
interest
with
whom
our
own
people
will
not
intermarry
or
hold
social
intercourse
but
keep
aloof
from
as
superior
from
inferior
to
impose
on
such
countries
forms
of
at
which
we
have
ourselves
but
lately
arrived
to
put
it
in
the
power
of
these
overwhelming
numbers
to
shake
us
off
if
they
please
and
to
assume
that
when
our
real
motive
has
been
only
to
save
ourselves
trouble
they
will
be
warmed
into
active
loyalty
by
gratitude
for
the
confidence
which
we
pretend
to
place
in
them
is
to
try
an
experiment
which
we
have
not
the
slightest
right
to
expect
to
be
successful
and
which
if
it
fails
is
fatal
once
more
if
we
mean
to
keep
the
blacks
as
british
subjects
we
are
bound
to
govern
them
and
to
govern
them
well
if
we
can
not
do
it
we
had
better
let
them
go
altogether
and
here
is
the
real
difficulty
it
is
not
that
men
competent
for
such
a
task
can
not
be
found
among
the
public
servants
of
great
britain
there
are
persons
always
to
be
found
fit
and
willing
for
posts
of
honour
and
difficulty
if
a
sincere
effort
be
made
to
find
them
alas
in
times
past
we
have
sent
persons
to
rule
our
baratarias
to
whom
sancho
panza
was
a
sage
troublesome
members
of
parliament
younger
brothers
of
powerful
families
impecunious
peers
favourites
with
backstairs
influence
for
whom
a
provision
was
to
be
found
colonial
clerks
bred
in
the
office
who
had
been
obsequious
and
useful
one
had
hoped
that
in
the
new
zeal
for
the
colonial
connection
such
appointments
would
have
become
impossible
for
the
future
yet
a
recent
incident
at
the
mauritius
has
proved
that
the
colonial
authorities
are
still
unregenerate
the
unfit
are
still
maintained
in
their
places
and
then
to
prevent
the
colonies
from
suffering
too
severely
under
their
incapacity
we
set
up
the
local
councils
nominated
or
elected
to
do
the
work
while
the
queen
representative
enjoys
his
salary
instances
of
glaring
impropriety
like
that
to
which
i
have
alluded
are
of
course
rare
and
among
colonial
governors
there
are
men
of
quality
so
high
that
we
would
desire
only
to
see
their
power
equal
to
it
but
so
limited
is
the
patronage
on
the
other
hand
which
remains
to
the
home
administrations
and
so
heavy
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
them
that
there
are
persons
also
in
these
situations
of
whom
it
may
be
said
that
the
less
they
do
and
the
less
they
are
enabled
to
do
the
better
for
the
colony
over
which
they
preside
the
west
indies
have
been
sufferers
from
another
cause
in
the
absence
of
other
use
for
them
they
have
been
made
to
serve
as
places
where
governors
try
their
hand
and
learn
their
business
before
promotion
to
more
important
situations
whether
a
man
has
done
well
or
done
ill
makes
it
seems
very
little
difference
unless
he
has
offended
prejudices
or
interests
at
home
once
in
the
service
he
acquires
a
vested
right
to
continue
in
it
a
governor
who
had
been
suspended
for
conduct
which
is
not
denied
to
have
been
most
improper
is
replaced
with
the
explanation
that
if
he
was
not
sent
back
to
his
old
post
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
provide
a
situation
for
him
elsewhere
why
would
it
has
a
captain
of
a
whose
ship
is
taken
from
him
for
misconduct
an
immediate
claim
to
have
another
unfortunate
colonies
it
is
not
their
interest
which
is
considered
under
this
system
but
the
subject
is
so
delicate
that
i
must
say
no
more
about
it
i
will
recommend
only
to
the
attention
of
the
british
democracy
who
are
now
the
parties
that
in
the
last
instance
are
responsible
because
they
are
the
real
masters
of
the
empire
the
following
apologue
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
nicholas
the
censors
of
the
press
seized
a
volume
which
had
been
published
by
the
poet
kriloff
on
the
ground
that
it
contained
treasonable
matter
nicholas
sent
for
kriloff
the
censor
produced
the
incriminated
passage
and
kriloff
was
made
to
read
it
aloud
it
was
a
fable
a
governor
of
a
russian
province
was
represented
as
arriving
in
the
other
world
and
as
being
brought
up
before
rhadamanthus
he
was
accused
not
of
any
crime
but
of
having
been
simply
a
nonentity
of
having
received
his
salary
and
spent
it
and
nothing
more
rhadamanthus
listened
and
when
the
accusing
angel
had
done
sentenced
the
prisoner
into
paradise
paradise
said
the
angel
he
has
done
nothing
said
rhadamanthus
how
would
it
have
been
if
he
had
done
anything
away
old
fellow
said
nicholas
to
kriloff
has
it
never
happened
that
british
colonial
officials
who
have
similarly
done
nothing
have
been
sent
into
the
paradise
of
promotion
because
they
have
kept
things
smooth
and
have
given
no
trouble
to
their
employers
at
home
in
the
evening
of
the
day
of
the
political
meeting
we
dined
at
government
house
there
was
a
large
representative
party
english
french
spaniards
corsicans
ladies
and
gentlemen
each
speaking
his
or
her
own
language
there
were
the
mayors
of
the
two
chief
towns
of
trinidad
port
of
spain
and
san
fernando
both
enthusiastic
for
a
constitution
the
latter
was
my
neighbour
at
dinner
and
insisted
much
on
the
fine
qualities
of
the
leading
persons
in
the
island
and
the
splendid
things
to
be
expected
when
responsible
government
should
be
conceded
the
training
squadron
had
arrived
from
barbadoes
and
the
commodore
and
two
or
three
officers
were
present
in
their
uniforms
there
was
interesting
talk
about
trinidad
troublesome
neighbour
guzman
blanco
the
president
of
venezuela
it
seems
that
sir
walter
raleigh
eldorado
has
turned
out
to
be
a
fact
after
all
on
the
higher
waters
of
the
orinoco
actual
gold
mines
do
exist
and
the
discovery
has
quickened
into
life
a
long
unsettled
dispute
about
boundaries
between
british
guiana
and
the
republic
don
guzman
had
been
encroaching
so
it
was
alleged
and
in
other
ways
had
been
offensive
and
impertinent
ships
were
going
had
been
actually
ordered
to
la
guyra
to
pull
his
nose
for
him
and
to
tell
him
to
behave
himself
the
time
is
past
when
we
flew
our
hawks
at
game
birds
the
opinion
of
most
of
the
party
was
that
don
guzman
knew
it
and
that
his
nose
would
not
be
pulled
he
would
regard
our
frigates
as
picturesque
ornaments
to
his
harbour
give
the
officers
in
command
the
politest
reception
evade
their
demands
offer
good
words
in
plenty
and
nothing
else
but
words
and
in
the
end
would
have
the
benefit
of
our
indifference
in
the
late
evening
we
had
music
our
host
sang
well
our
hostess
was
an
accomplished
artist
they
had
duets
together
italian
and
english
and
the
lady
then
sang
three
fishers
kingsley
being
looked
on
as
the
personal
property
of
trinidad
and
as
one
of
themselves
she
sang
it
very
well
as
well
as
any
one
could
do
who
had
no
direct
acquaintance
with
an
english
people
her
voice
was
beautiful
and
she
showed
genuine
feeling
the
silence
when
she
ended
was
more
complimentary
than
the
loudest
applause
it
was
broken
by
a
stupid
member
of
council
who
said
to
me
it
not
strange
that
a
poet
with
such
a
gift
of
words
as
kingsley
should
have
ended
that
song
with
so
weak
a
line
the
sooner
it
over
the
sooner
to
sleep
is
nothing
but
prose
he
did
not
see
that
the
fault
which
he
thought
he
had
discovered
is
no
more
than
the
intentional
away
of
the
emotion
created
by
the
story
in
the
common
lot
of
poor
humanity
we
drove
back
across
the
savannah
in
a
blaze
of
fireflies
it
is
not
till
midnight
that
they
put
their
lights
out
and
go
to
sleep
with
the
rest
of
the
world
one
duty
remained
to
me
before
i
left
the
island
the
warners
are
among
the
oldest
of
west
indian
families
distinguished
through
many
generations
not
the
least
in
their
then
living
chief
and
representative
charles
warner
who
in
the
highest
ministerial
offices
had
steered
trinidad
through
the
trying
times
which
followed
the
abolition
of
slavery
i
had
myself
in
early
life
been
brought
into
relations
with
other
members
of
his
family
he
himself
was
a
very
old
man
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
but
hearing
that
i
was
in
port
of
spain
he
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
me
i
found
him
in
his
drawing
room
shrunk
in
stature
pale
bent
double
by
weight
of
years
and
but
feebly
able
to
lift
his
head
to
speak
i
thought
and
i
judged
rightly
that
he
could
have
but
a
few
weeks
perhaps
but
a
few
days
to
live
there
is
something
peculiarly
solemn
in
being
brought
to
speak
with
a
supremely
eminent
man
who
is
already
struggling
with
the
moment
which
is
to
launch
him
into
a
new
existence
he
raised
himself
in
his
chair
he
gave
me
his
withered
hand
his
eyes
still
gleamed
with
the
light
of
an
untouched
intelligence
all
else
of
him
seemed
dead
the
soul
untouched
by
the
decay
of
the
frame
which
had
been
its
earthly
tenement
burnt
bright
as
ever
on
the
edge
of
its
release
when
words
are
scarce
they
are
seldom
spent
in
vain
and
they
breathe
truth
who
breathe
their
words
in
pain
he
roused
himself
to
talk
and
he
talked
sadly
for
all
things
at
home
and
everywhere
were
travelling
on
the
road
which
he
well
knew
could
lead
to
no
good
end
no
statesman
had
done
better
practical
work
than
he
or
work
which
had
borne
better
fruit
could
it
be
allowed
to
ripen
but
for
him
trinidad
would
have
been
a
wilderness
savage
as
when
columbus
found
the
caribs
there
he
belonged
to
the
race
who
make
empires
as
the
orators
lose
them
who
do
things
and
do
not
talk
about
them
who
build
and
do
not
cast
down
who
reverence
ancient
habits
and
institutions
as
the
organic
functions
of
corporate
national
character
a
tory
of
the
tories
who
nevertheless
recognised
that
toryism
itself
was
passing
away
under
the
universal
solvent
and
had
ceased
to
be
a
faith
which
could
be
believed
in
as
a
guide
to
conduct
he
no
more
than
any
one
could
tell
what
it
was
now
wisest
or
even
possible
to
do
he
spoke
like
some
ancient
whose
eyes
looked
beyond
the
present
time
and
the
present
world
and
saw
politics
and
progress
and
the
wild
whirlwind
of
change
as
the
play
of
atoms
dancing
to
and
fro
in
the
sunbeams
of
eternity
yet
he
wished
well
to
our
poor
earth
and
to
us
who
were
still
struggling
upon
it
he
was
sorry
for
the
courses
on
which
he
saw
mankind
to
be
travelling
spite
of
all
the
newspapers
and
the
blowing
of
the
trumpets
he
well
understood
whither
all
that
was
tending
he
spoke
with
horror
and
even
loathing
of
the
sinister
leader
who
was
drawing
england
into
the
fatal
whirlpool
he
could
still
hope
for
he
knew
the
power
of
the
race
he
knew
that
the
english
heart
was
unaffected
that
we
were
suffering
only
from
delirium
of
the
brain
the
day
would
yet
come
he
thought
when
we
should
struggle
back
into
sanity
again
with
such
wreck
of
our
past
greatness
as
might
still
be
left
to
us
torn
and
shattered
but
clothed
and
in
our
right
mind
and
cured
for
centuries
of
our
illusions
my
forebodings
of
the
nearness
of
the
end
were
too
well
founded
a
month
later
i
heard
that
charles
warner
was
dead
to
have
seen
and
spoken
with
such
a
man
was
worth
a
voyage
round
the
globe
on
the
prospects
of
trinidad
i
have
a
few
more
words
to
add
the
tendency
of
the
island
is
to
become
what
grenada
has
become
already
a
community
of
negro
freeholders
each
living
on
his
own
homestead
and
raising
or
gathering
off
the
ground
what
his
own
family
will
consume
they
will
multiply
for
there
is
ample
room
of
the
soil
are
still
unoccupied
the
blacks
will
rapidly
grow
into
a
and
the
as
long
as
we
are
on
the
spot
to
keep
the
peace
will
speedily
double
itself
again
the
english
inhabitants
will
and
must
be
crowded
out
the
geographical
advantages
of
the
gulf
of
paria
will
secure
a
certain
amount
of
trade
there
will
be
merchants
and
bankers
in
the
town
as
floating
passage
birds
and
there
will
be
mulatto
lawyers
and
shopkeepers
and
newspaper
writers
but
the
blacks
hate
the
mulattoes
and
the
mulatto
breed
will
not
maintain
itself
as
with
the
independence
of
the
blacks
the
intimacy
between
blacks
and
whites
diminishes
and
must
diminish
the
english
peasant
immigration
which
enthusiasts
have
believed
in
is
a
dream
a
dream
which
passed
through
the
ivory
gate
a
dream
which
will
never
turn
to
a
waking
reality
and
unless
under
the
indian
system
which
our
rulers
will
never
try
unless
the
democracy
orders
them
to
adopt
it
the
english
interest
will
come
to
an
end
the
english
have
proved
in
india
that
they
can
play
a
great
and
useful
part
as
rulers
over
recognised
inferiors
even
in
the
west
indies
the
planters
were
a
real
something
like
the
english
in
ireland
they
produced
a
remarkable
breed
of
men
the
codringtons
the
warners
and
many
illustrious
names
besides
they
governed
cheaply
on
their
own
resources
and
the
islands
under
their
rule
were
so
profitable
that
we
fought
for
them
as
if
our
empire
was
at
stake
all
that
is
gone
the
days
of
ruling
races
are
supposed
to
be
numbered
trade
drifts
away
to
the
nearest
market
to
new
york
or
new
orleans
and
in
a
money
point
of
view
the
value
of
such
possessions
as
trinidad
will
soon
be
less
than
nothing
to
us
as
long
as
the
present
system
holds
there
will
be
an
appreciable
addition
to
the
sum
of
human
coloured
human
happiness
creatures
do
not
exist
on
the
globe
but
the
continuance
of
it
depends
on
the
continuance
of
the
english
rule
the
peace
and
order
which
they
benefit
by
is
not
of
their
own
creation
in
spite
of
schools
and
missionaries
the
dark
connection
still
maintains
itself
with
invisible
world
and
modern
education
contends
in
vain
with
obeah
worship
as
it
has
been
in
hayti
so
it
must
be
in
trinidad
if
the
english
leave
the
blacks
to
be
their
own
masters
scene

the

the

the

but
they
have
left
behind

no

healthy
civilisation
and
the
prospect
darkens
once
more
it
is
a
pity
for
there
is
no
real
necessity
that
it
should
darken
the

indian
negro
is
conscious
of
his

defects

responds
more
willingly
than
most
to
a
guiding
hand
he
is
faithful
and
affectionate
to
those
who
are
just
and
kind
to
him
and
with
a
century
or
two
of
wise
administration
he
might
prove
that
his
inferiority
is
not
inherent
and
that
with
the
same
chances
as
the
white
he
may
rise
to
the
same
level
i
can
not
part
with
the
hope
that
the
english
people
may
yet
insist
that
the
chance
shall
not
be
denied
to
him
and
that
they
may
yet
give
their
officials
to
understand
that
they
must

shall
not
shake
off
their
responsibilities
for
this
unfortunate
people
by
flinging
them
back
upon
themselves
manage
their
own
affairs
now
that
we
have
no
further
use
for
them
i
was
told
that
the
trinidad
blacks
are
watching
as
eagerly
as
we
do
the
development
of
the
irish
problem
they
see
the
identity
of
the
situation
they
see
that
if
the
radical
view
prevails
and
in
every
country
the
majority
are
to
rule
trinidad
will
be
theirs
and
the
government
of
the
english
will
be
at
an
end
i
for
myself
look
upon
trinidad
and
the
west
indies
generally
as
an
opportunity
for
the
further
extension
of
the
influence
of
the
english
race
in
their
special
capacity
of
leaders
and
governors
of
men
we
can
not
with
honour
divest
ourselves
of
our
responsibility
for
the
blacks
or
after
the
eloquence
we
have
poured
out
and
the
which
we
have
allowed
ourselves
for
the
suppression
of
slavery
leave
them
now
to
relapse
into
a
state
from
which
slavery
itself
was
the
first
step
of
emancipation
our
dominion
will
not
be
of
any
long
endurance
if
we
consider
that
we
have
discharged
our
full
duty
to
our
when
we
have
set
them
free
to
follow
their
own
devices
if
that
is
to
be
all
the
sooner
it
vanishes
into
history
the
better
for
us
and
for
the

have

of
studying
more
at
leisure
the
earliest
of
our
west
indian
colonies
barbadoes
is
as
unlike
in
appearance
as
it
is
in
social
condition
to
trinidad
or
the
antilles
there
are
no
mountains
in
it
no
forests
no
rivers
and
as
yet
no
small
freeholders
the
blacks

number
nearly

they

you

rides
as
well
mounted
and
as
well

as
you
can
see

barbadoes
is
thus
in
pleasing
contrast
with
the
conquered
islands
which
we
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
assimilate
in
them
remain
the
wrecks
of
the
french

which
we
superseded
while
we
have
planted
nothing

the
european
aspect
of
it
at
any
rate
is
english
throughout

when
we
arrived
was
even
more
brilliant
than
we
had
left
it
a
fortnight
before
the
training
squadron
had
gone

in

place
of
it
the

were

also

we
had
no
sooner
anchored
than
a
boat
was
alongside
with
an
awning
and
an
ensign
at
the
stern
colonel
the
chief
of
the
police
to
whom
it
belonged
came
on
board
in
search
of
miss
who
was
to
be
his
guest
in
bridgetown
she
introduced
me
to
him
he
insisted
on
my
accompanying
him
home
to
breakfast
and
as
he
was
a
person
in
authority
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
obey
colonel
to
whose
politeness
then
and
afterwards
i
was
in
many
ways
indebted
had
seen
life
in
various
forms
he
had
been
in
the
navy
he
had
been
in
the
army
he
had
been
called
to
the
bar
he
was
now
the
head
of
the
barbadoes
police
with
this
anomalous
addition
to
his
other
duties
that
in
default
of
a
chaplain
he
read
the
church
service
on
sundays
in
the
barracks
he
had
even
a
license
from
the
bishop
to
preach
sermons
and
being
a
man
of
fine
character
and
original
sense
he
discharged
this
last
function
i
was
told
remarkably
well
his
house
was
in
the
heart
of
the
town
but
shaded
with
tropical
trees
the
rooms
were
protected
by
deep
outside
galleries
which
were
overrun
with
bougainvillier
creepers
he
was
himself
the
kindest
of
entertainers
his
irish
lady
the
kindest
of
hostesses
with
the
humorous
high
breeding
of
the
old
sligo
aristocracy
to
whom
she
belonged
i
found
that
i
had
been
acquainted
with
some
of
her
kindred
there
long
ago
in
the
days
when
the
rule
had
not
been
discovered
to
be
a
upas
tree
and
cultivated
human
life
was
still
possible
in
connaught
of
the
breakfast
which
consisted
of
all
the
west
indian
dainties
i
had
ever
heard
or
read
of
i
can
say
nothing
nor
of
the
pleasant
talk
which
followed
i
was
to
see
more
of
colonel
for
he
offered
to
drive
me
some
day
across
the
island
a
promise
which
he
punctually
fulfilled
my
stay
with
him
for
the
present
could
be
but
brief
as
i
was
expected
at
government
house
i
have
met
with
exceptional
hospitality
from
the
governors
of
british
colonies
in
many
parts
of
the
world
they
are
not
chosen
like
the
roman
proconsuls
from
the
ranks
of
trained
statesmen
who
have
held
high
administrative
offices
at
home
they
are
appointed
as
i
said
just
now
from
various
motives
sometimes
with
a
careful
regard
to
fitness
for
their
post
sometimes
with
a
regard
merely
to
routine
or
convenience
or
to
personal
influence
brought
to
bear
in
their
favour
i
have
myself
seen
some
for
whom
i
should
have
thought
other
employment
would
have
been
more
suitable
but
always
and
everywhere
those
that
i
have
fallen
in
with
have
been
men
of
honour
and
integrity
above
reproach
or
suspicion
and
i
have
met
with
one
or
two
gentlemen
in
these
situations
whose
admirable
qualities
it
is
impossible
to
praise
too
highly
who
in
their
complicated
responsibilities
responsibilities
to
the
colonies
and
responsibilities
to
the
authorities
at
home
have
considered
conscience
and
duty
to
be
their
safest
guides
have
cared
only
to
do
what
they
believed
to
be
right
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
have
left
their
interests
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
governor
of
barbadoes
is
not
despotic
he
controls
the
administration
but
there
is
a
constitution
as
old
as
the
stuarts
an
assembly
of
members
nine
of
whom
the
crown
nominates
the
rest
are
elected
the
friction
is
not
so
violent
as
when
the
number
of
the
nominated
and
elected
members
is
equal
and
as
long
as
a
property
qualification
was
required
for
the
franchise
the
system
may
have
worked
tolerably
without
producing
any
violent
mischief
there
have
been
recent
modifications
however
pointing
in
the
same
direction
as
those
which
have
been
made
in
jamaica
by
an
ordinance
from
home
the
suffrage
has
been
widely
extended
obviously
as
a
step
to
larger
intended
changes
under
such
conditions
and
with
an
uncertain
future
a
governor
can
do
little
save
lead
and
influence
entertain
visitors
discharge
the
necessary
courtesies
to
all
classes
of
his
subjects
and
keep
his
eyes
open
these
duties
at
least
sir
charles
lee
discharges
to
perfection
the
entertaining
part
of
them
on
a
scale
so
liberal
that
if
père
labat
came
back
he
would
suppose
that
the
two
hundred
years
which
have
gone
by
since
his
visit
was
a
dream
and
that
government
house
at
least
was
still
as
he
left
it
in
an
establishment
which
had
so
many
demands
upon
it
and
where
so
many
visitors
of
all
kinds
were
going
and
coming
i
had
no
claim
to
be
admitted
i
felt
that
i
should
be
an
intruder
and
had
i
been
allowed
would
have
taken
myself
elsewhere
but
sir
peremptory
generosity
admitted
of
no
refusal
as
a
subject
i
was
bound
to
submit
to
the
queen
representative
i
can
not
say
i
was
sorry
to
be
compelled
in
government
house
i
should
see
and
hear
what
i
could
neither
have
seen
nor
heard
elsewhere
i
should
meet
people
who
could
tell
me
what
i
most
wanted
to
know
i
had
understood
already
that
owing
to
the
sugar
depression
the
state
of
the
island
was
critical
officials
were
alarmed
bankers
were
alarmed
no
one
could
see
beyond
the
next
year
what
was
likely
to
happen
sir
charles
himself
would
have
most
to
say
he
was
evidently
anxious
perhaps
if
he
had
a
fault
he
was
over
anxious
but
with
the
possibility
of
social
confusion
before
him
with
nearly
peasant
subjects
who
in
a
few
months
might
be
out
of
work
and
so
out
of
food
with
the
inflammable
negro
nature
and
a
suspicious
and
easily
excited
public
opinion
at
home
the
position
of
a
governor
of
barbadoes
is
not
an
enviable
one
the
government
at
home
no
doubt
with
the
best
intentions
has
aggravated
any
peril
which
there
may
be
by
enlarging
the
suffrage
the
experience
of
governor
eyre
in
jamaica
has
taught
the
danger
of
being
too
active
but
to
be
too
inactive
may
be
dangerous
also
if
there
is
a
stir
again
in
any
part
of
these
islands
and
violence
and
massacre
come
of
it
as
it
came
in
domingo
the
responsibility
is
with
the
governor
and
the
account
will
be
strictly
exacted
of
him
i
must
describe
more
particularly
the
reasons
which
there
are
for
uneasiness
on
the
day
on
which
i
landed
i
saw
an
article
in
a
bridgetown
paper
in
which
my
coming
there
was
spoken
of
as
perhaps
the
last
straw
which
would
break
the
overburdened
back
i
know
not
why
i
should
be
thought
likely
to
add
anything
to
the
load
of
barbadian
afflictions
i
should
be
a
worse
friend
to
the
colonies
than
i
have
tried
to
be
if
i
was
one
of
those
who
would
quench
the
smoking
flax
of
loyalty
in
any
west
indian
heart
but
loyalty
i
very
well
know
is
sorely
tried
just
now
the
position
is
painfully
simple
the
great
prosperity
of
the
island
ended
with
emancipation
barbadoes
suffered
less
than
jamaica
or
the
antilles
because
the
population
was
large
and
the
land
limited
and
the
blacks
were
obliged
to
work
to
keep
themselves
alive
the
abolition
of
the
sugar
duties
was
the
next
blow
the
price
of
sugar
fell
and
the
estates
yielded
little
more
than
the
expense
of
cultivation
owners
of
properties
who
were
their
own
managers
and
had
sense
and
energy
continued
to
keep
themselves
afloat
but
absenteeism
had
become
the
fashion
the
brilliant
society
which
is
described
by
labat
had
been
melting
for
more
than
a
century
more
and
more
the
old
west
indian
families
removed
to
england
farmed
their
lands
through
agents
and
overseers
or
sold
them
to
speculating
capitalists
the
personal
influence
of
the
white
man
over
the
black
which
might
have
been
brought
about
by
a
friendly
intercourse
after
slavery
was
abolished
was
never
so
much
as
attempted
the
higher
class
of
gentry
found
the
colony
more
and
more
distasteful
to
them
and
they
left
the
arrangement
of
the
labour
question
to
persons
to
whom
the
blacks
were
nothing
emancipated
though
they
might
be
except
instruments
of
production
a
negro
can
be
attached
to
his
employer
at
least
as
easily
as
a
horse
or
a
dog
the
horse
or
dog
requires
kind
treatment
or
he
becomes
indifferent
or
sullen
so
it
is
with
the
negro
but
the
forced
equality
of
the
races
before
the
law
made
more
difficult
the
growth
of
any
kindly
feeling
to
the
overseer
on
a
plantation
the
black
labourer
was
a
machine
out
of
which
the
problem
was
to
get
the
maximum
of
work
with
the
minimum
of
pay
in
the
slavery
times
the
horse
and
dog
relation
was
a
real
thing
the
master
and
mistress
joked
and
laughed
with
their
dark
bondsmen
knew
cæsar
from
pompey
knew
how
many
children
each
had
gave
them
small
presents
cared
for
them
when
they
were
sick
and
maintained
them
when
they
were
old
and
past
work
all
this
ended
with
emancipation
between
whites
and
blacks
no
relations
remained
save
that
of
employer
and
employed
they
lived
apart
they
had
no
longer
save
in
exceptional
instances
any
personal
communication
with
each
other
the
law
refusing
to
recognise
a
difference
the
social
line
was
drawn
the
harder
which
the
law
was
unable
to
reach
in
the
antilles
the
plantations
broke
up
as
i
had
seen
in
grenada
the
whites
went
away
and
the
land
was
divided
among
the
negroes
in
barbadoes
the
estates
were
kept
together
the
english
character
and
the
english
habits
were
stamped
deeper
there
and
were
not
so
easily
obliterated
but
the
stars
in
their
courses
have
fought
against
the
old
system
once
the
west
indies
had
a
monopoly
of
the
sugar
trade
steam
and
progress
have
given
them
a
hundred
competitors
and
on
the
back
of
these
came
the
beetroot
sugar
competition
meanwhile
the
expense
of
living
increased
in
the
days
of
inflated
hope
and
prosperity
free
trade
whatever
its
immediate
consequences
was
to
make
everyone
rich
in
the
end
when
the
income
of
an
estate
fell
short
one
year
it
was
to
rise
in
the
next
and
the
money
was
borrowed
to
make
ends
meet
when
it
did
rise
more
money
was
borrowed
and
there
is
now
hardly
a
property
in
the
island
which
is
not
loaded
to
the
sinking
point
tied
to
barbadoes
has
no
second
industry
to
fall
back
upon
the
blacks
who
are
heedless
and
increase
and
multiply
they
will
not
emigrate
they
are
so
much
attached
to
their
homes
and
the
not
distant
prospect
is
of
a
general
bankruptcy
which
may
throw
the
land
for
the
moment
out
of
cultivation
with
a
hungry
unemployed
multitude
to
feed
without
means
of
feeding
them
and
to
control
without
the
personal
acquaintance
and
influence
which
alone
can
make
control
possible
at
home
there
is
a
general
knowledge
that
things
are
not
going
on
well
out
there
but
true
to
our
own
ways
of
thinking
we
regard
it
as
their
affair
and
not
as
ours
if
cheap
sugar
ruins
the
planters
it
benefits
the
english
workman
the
planters
had
their
innings
it
is
now
the
consumer
turn
what
are
the
west
indies
to
us
on
the
map
they
appear
to
belong
more
to
the
united
states
than
to
us
let
the
united
states
take
them
and
welcome
so
thinks
perhaps
the
average
englishman
and
analogous
to
him
the
west
indian
proprietor
reflects
that
if
admitted
into
the
union
he
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
american
market
which
would
set
him
on
his
feet
again
and
that
the
americans
probably
finding
that
they
if
not
we
could
make
some
profit
out
of
the
islands
would
be
likely
to
settle
the
black
question
for
him
in
a
more
satisfactory
manner
that
such
a
feeling
as
this
should
exist
is
natural
and
pardonable
and
it
would
have
gone
deeper
than
it
has
gone
if
it
were
not
that
there
are
two
parties
to
every
bargain
and
those
in
favour
of
such
a
union
have
met
hitherto
with
no
encouragement
the
americans
are
wise
in
their
generation
they
looked
at
cuba
they
looked
at
domingo
they
might
have
had
both
on
easy
terms
but
they
tell
you
that
their
constitution
does
not
allow
them
to
hold
dependent
states
what
they
annex
they
absorb
and
they
did
not
wish
to
absorb
another
million
and
a
half
of
blacks
and
as
many
roman
catholics
having
enough
already
of
both
our
english
islands
may
be
more
tempting
but
there
too
the
black
cloud
hangs
thick
and
grows
yearly
thicker
and
through
english
indulgence
is
more
charged
with
dangerous
elements
already
they
say
they
have
every
advantage
which
the
islands
can
give
them
they
exercise
a
general
protectorate
and
would
probably
interfere
if
france
or
england
were
to
attempt
again
to
extend
their
dominions
in
that
quarter
but
they
prefer
to
leave
to
the
present
owners
the
responsibility
of
managing
and
feeding
the
cow
while
they
are
to
have
the
milking
of
it
thus
the
proposal
of
annexation
which
has
never
gone
beyond
wishes
and
talk
has
so
far
been
coldly
received
but
the
americans
did
make
their
offer
a
short
time
since
at
which
the
drowning
barbadians
grasped
as
at
a
floating
plank
england
would
give
them
no
hand
to
save
them
from
the
effects
of
the
beetroot
bounties
the
americans
were
willing
to
relax
their
own
sugar
duties
to
admit
west
indian
sugar
duty
free
and
give
them
the
benefit
of
their
own
high
prices
the
colonies
being
unable
to
make
treaties
for
themselves
the
proposal
was
referred
home
and
was
rejected
the
board
of
trade
had
no
doubt
excellent
reasons
for
objecting
to
an
arrangement
which
would
have
flung
our
whole
commerce
with
the
west
indies
into
american
hands
and
might
have
formed
a
prelude
to
a
closer
attachment
it
would
have
been
a
violation
also
of
those
principles
which
are
the
english
political
gospel
moreover
our
attitude
towards
our
colonies
has
changed
in
the
last
twenty
years
we
now
wish
to
preserve
the
attachment
of
communities
whom
a
generation
back
we
should
have
told
to
do
as
they
liked
and
have
bidden
them
god
speed
on
their
way
and
this
treaty
may
have
been
regarded
as
a
step
towards
separation
but
the
unfortunate
barbadians
found
themselves
with
the
harbour
in
sight
driven
out
again
into
the
hurricane
we
would
not
help
them
ourselves
we
declined
to
let
the
americans
help
them
and
help
themselves
they
could
not
they
dare
not
resent
our
indifference
to
their
interests
which
if
they
were
stronger
would
have
been
more
visibly
displayed
they
must
wait
now
for
what
the
future
will
bring
with
as
much
composure
as
they
can
command
but
i
did
hear
outcries
of
impatience
to
which
it
was
unpleasant
to
listen
nay
it
was
even
suggested
as
a
means
of
inducing
the
americans
to
forego
their
reluctance
to
take
them
into
the
union
that
we
might
relinquish
such
rights
as
we
possessed
in
canada
if
the
americans
would
relieve
us
of
the
west
indies
for
which
we
appeared
to
care
so
little
if
barbadoes
is
driven
into
bankruptcy
the
estates
will
have
to
be
sold
and
will
probably
be
broken
up
as
they
have
been
in
the
antilles
the
first
difficulty
will
thus
be
got
over
but
the
change
can
not
be
carried
out
in
a
day
if
wages
suddenly
cease
the
negroes
will
starve
and
will
not
take
their
starvation
patiently
at
the
worst
however
means
will
probably
be
found
to
keep
the
land
from
falling
out
of
cultivation
the
barbadians
see
their
condition
in
the
light
of
their
grievances
and
make
the
worst
of
it
the
continental
powers
may
tire
of
the
bounty
system
or
something
else
may
happen
to
make
sugar
rise
the
prospect
is
not
a
bright
one
but
what
actually
happens
in
this
world
is
generally
the
unexpected
as
a
visit
my
stay
at
government
house
was
made
simply
delightful
to
me
i
remained
there
with
interruptions
for
a
fortnight
and
lady
l
did
not
only
permit
but
she
insisted
that
i
should
be
as
if
in
an
hotel
and
come
and
go
as
i
liked
the
climate
of
barbadoes
so
far
as
i
can
speak
of
it
is
as
sparkling
and
invigorating
as
champagne
cocktail
may
be
wanted
in
trinidad
in
barbadoes
the
air
is
all
one
asks
for
and
between
night
breezes
and
sea
breezes
one
has
plenty
of
it
day
begins
with
daylight
as
it
ought
to
do
you
have
slept
without
knowing
anything
about
it
there
are
no
venomous
crawling
creatures
cockroaches
are
the
worst
but
they
scuttle
out
of
the
way
so
alarmed
and
ashamed
of
themselves
if
you
happen
to
see
them
that
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
hurt
one
you
spring
out
of
bed
as
if
the
process
of
getting
up
were
actually
pleasant
west
indian
houses
are
generally
provided
with
a
swimming
bath
though
cold
by
courtesy
the
water
seldom
falls
below
and
you
float
luxuriously
upon
it
without
dread
of
chill
the
early
coffee
follows
the
bath
and
then
the
stroll
under
the
big
trees
among
strange
flowers
or
in
the
grotto
with
the
ferns
and
humming
birds
if
it
were
part
of
one
regular
life
i
suppose
that
one
would
want
something
to
do
sir
charles
was
the
most
active
of
men
and
had
been
busy
in
his
office
for
an
hour
before
i
had
come
down
to
lounge
but
for
myself
i
discovered
that
it
was
possible
at
least
for
an
interval
to
be
perfectly
idle
and
perfectly
happy
surrounded
by
the
daintiest
beauties
of
an
english
hothouse
with
palm
trees
waving
like
fans
to
cool
one
and
with
sensitive
plants
which
are
common
as
daisies
strewing
themselves
under
one
feet
to
be
trodden
upon
after
breakfast
the
heat
would
be
considerable
but
with
an
umbrella
i
could
walk
about
the
town
and
see
what
was
to
be
seen
alas
here
one
has
something
to
desire
where
père
labat
saw
a
display
of
splendour
which
reminded
him
of
paris
and
london
you
now
find
only
on
the
american
pattern
for
the
most
part
american
goods
bad
in
quality
and
extravagantly
dear
treaty
or
no
treaty
it
is
to
america
that
the
trade
is
drifting
and
we
might
as
well
concede
with
a
good
grace
what
must
soon
come
of
itself
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
streets
are
relieved
from
ugliness
by
the
trees
and
by
occasional
handsome
buildings
often
i
stood
to
admire
the
nelson
once
i
went
into
the
assembly
where
the
legislature
was
discussing
more
or
less
unquietly
the
prospects
of
the
island
the
question
of
the
hour
was
economy
in
the
opinion
of
patriot
barbadians
sore
at
the
refusal
of
the
treaty
the
readiest
way
to
reduce
expenditure
was
to
diminish
the
salaries
of
officials
from
the
governor
downwards
the
officials
knowing
that
they
were
very
moderately
paid
already
naturally
demurred
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
thing
to
me
was
the
in
which
the
proceedings
were
going
on
it
is
handsome
in
itself
and
has
a
series
of
painted
windows
representing
the
english
sovereigns
from
james
to
queen
victoria
among
them
in
his
proper
place
stood
oliver
cromwell
the
only
formal
recognition
of
the
great
protector
that
i
know
of
in
any
part
of
the
english
dominions
barbadoes
had
been
cavalier
in
its
general
sympathies
but
has
taken
an
independent
view
of
things
and
here
too
has
had
an
opinion
of
its
own
hospitality
was
always
a
west
indian
characteristic
there
were
luncheons
and
dinners
and
distinguished
persons
to
be
met
and
talked
to
among
these
i
had
the
special
good
fortune
of
making
acquaintance
with
sir
charles
pearson
now
in
those
parts
even
in
these
days
crowded
as
they
are
by
small
incidents
made
large
by
newspapers
we
have
not
yet
forgotten
the
defence
of
a
fort
in
the
interior
of
zululand
where
sir
charles
pearson
and
his
small
garrison
were
cut
off
from
their
communications
with
natal
for
a
week
or
two
he
was
the
chief
object
of
interest
in
every
english
house
in
obedience
to
orders
which
it
was
not
his
business
to
question
he
had
assisted
sir
shepstone
in
the
memorable
annexation
of
the
transvaal
he
had
seen
also
to
what
that
annexation
led
and
being
a
man
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
completeness
of
our
defeat
our
military
establishment
in
the
west
indies
is
of
modest
dimensions
but
a
strong
english
soldier
who
says
little
and
does
his
duty
and
never
told
a
lie
in
his
life
or
could
tell
one
is
a
comforting
figure
to
fall
in
with
one
feels
that
there
will
be
something
to
retire
upon
when
parliamentary
oratory
has
finished
its
work
of
disintegration
the
pleasantest
incident
of
the
day
was
the
evening
drive
with
lady
l
she
would
take
me
out
shortly
before
sunset
and
bring
me
back
again
when
the
tropical
stars
were
showing
faintly
and
the
fireflies
had
begun
to
sparkle
about
the
bushes
and
the
bats
were
flitting
to
and
fro
after
the
night
moths
like
spirits
of
darkness
chasing
human
souls
the
neighbourhood
of
bridgetown
has
little
natural
beauty
but
the
roads
are
excellent
the
savannah
picturesque
with
riding
parties
and
polo
players
and
lounging
red
jackets
every
one
being
eager
to
pay
his
or
her
respect
to
the
gracious
lady
of
the
queen
representative
we
called
at
pretty
villas
where
there
would
be
evening
teas
and
lawn
tennis
in
the
cool
the
society
is
not
extensive
and
here
would
be
collected
most
of
it
that
was
worth
meeting
at
one
of
these
parties
i
fell
in
with
the
officers
of
the
american
squadron
the
commodore
a
very
interesting
and
courteous
gentleman
whom
i
should
have
taken
for
a
there
are
many
diamonds
and
diamonds
of
the
first
water
among
the
americans
as
among
ourselves
but
the
cutting
and
setting
is
different
commodore
d
was
cut
and
set
like
an
englishman
he
introduced
me
to
one
of
his
brother
officers
who
had
been
in
hayti
spite
of
sir
spenser
john
spite
of
all
the
confirmatory
evidence
which
i
had
heard
i
was
still
incredulous
about
the
alleged
cannibalism
there
to
my
inquiries
this
gentleman
had
only
the
same
answer
to
give
the
fact
was
beyond
question
he
had
himself
known
instances
of
it
the
commodore
had
a
grievance
against
us
illustrating
west
indian
manners
these
islands
are
as
nervous
about
their
health
as
so
many
old
ladies
the
yellow
flags
float
on
ship
after
ship
in
the
bridgetown
roadstead
and
crews
passengers
and
cargoes
are
sternly
interdicted
from
the
land
jamaica
was
in
ill
name
from
and
as
cuba
will
not
drop
its
intercourse
with
jamaica
cuba
falls
also
under
the
ban
the
commodore
had
directed
a
case
of
cigars
from
havana
to
meet
him
at
barbadoes
they
arrived
but
might
not
be
transferred
from
the
steamer
which
brought
them
even
on
board
his
own
frigate
lest
he
might
bring
infection
on
shore
in
his
pocket
they
went
on
to
england
to
reach
him
perhaps
eventually
in
new
york
colonel
duties
as
chief
of
the
police
obliged
him
to
make
occasional
rounds
to
visit
his
stations
he
recollected
his
promise
and
he
invited
me
one
morning
to
accompany
him
we
were
to
breakfast
at
his
house
on
our
return
so
i
anticipated
an
excursion
of
a
few
miles
at
the
utmost
he
called
for
me
soon
after
sunrise
with
a
light
carriage
and
a
brisk
pair
of
horses
we
were
rapidly
clear
of
the
town
the
roads
were
better
than
the
best
i
have
seen
out
of
england
the
only
fault
in
them
being
the
white
coral
dust
which
dazzles
and
blinds
the
eyes
everywhere
there
were
signs
of
age
and
of
long
occupation
the
stone
steps
leading
up
out
of
the
road
to
the
doors
of
the
houses
had
been
worn
by
human
feet
for
hundreds
of
years
the
houses
themselves
were
old
and
as
if
suffering
from
the
universal
depression
gates
broken
gardens
disordered
and
woodwork
black
and
blistered
for
want
of
paint
but
if
the
habitations
were
neglected
there
was
no
neglect
in
the
fields
sugar
cane
alternated
with
sweet
potatoes
and
yams
and
other
strange
things
the
names
of
which
i
heard
and
forgot
but
there
was
not
a
weed
to
be
seen
or
broken
fence
where
fence
was
needed
the
soil
was
clean
every
inch
of
it
as
well
hoed
and
trenched
as
in
a
middlesex
market
garden
salt
fish
and
flour
which
is
the
chief
food
of
the
blacks
is
imported
but
vegetables
enough
are
raised
in
barbadoes
to
keep
the
cost
of
living
incredibly
low
and
to
my
uninstructed
eyes
it
seemed
that
even
if
sugar
and
wages
did
fail
there
could
be
no
danger
of
any
sudden
famine
the
people
were
thick
as
rabbits
in
a
warren
women
with
loaded
baskets
on
their
heads
laughing
and
chirruping
men
driving
donkey
carts
four
donkeys
abreast
smoking
their
early
pipes
as
if
they
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
as
indeed
they
have
not
on
we
went
the
colonel
horses
stepping
out
twelve
miles
an
hour
and
i
wondered
privately
what
was
to
become
of
our
breakfast
we
were
striking
right
across
the
island
along
the
coral
ridge
which
forms
the
backbone
of
it
we
found
ourselves
at
length
in
a
grove
of
orange
trees
and
shaddocks
at
the
old
church
of
john
which
stands
upon
a
perpendicular
cliff
codrington
college
on
the
level
under
our
feet
and
beyond
us
the
open
atlantic
and
the
everlasting
breakers
from
the
trade
winds
fringing
the
shore
with
foam
far
out
were
the
white
sails
of
the
fishing
smacks
the
barbadians
are
careless
of
weather
and
the
best
of
boat
sailors
it
was
very
pretty
in
the
bright
morning
and
the
church
itself
was
not
the
least
interesting
part
of
the
scene
the
door
was
wide
open
we
went
in
and
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
parish
church
in
england
as
parish
churches
used
to
be
when
i
was
a
child
there
were
the
seats
the
old
unadorned
communion
table
the
old
pulpit
and
reading
desk
and
the
clerk
desk
below
with
the
lion
and
the
unicorn
conspicuous
above
the
chancel
arch
the
white
tablets
on
the
wall
bore
familiar
names
dating
back
into
the
last
century
on
the
floor
were
flagstones
still
older
with
armorial
bearings
and
letters
cut
in
stone
half
effaced
by
the
feet
of
the
generations
who
had
trodden
up
the
same
aisles
till
they
too
lay
down
and
rested
there
and
there
was
this
too
to
be
remembered
that
these
barbadian
churches
old
as
they
might
seem
had
belonged
always
to
the
anglican
communion
no
mass
had
ever
been
said
at
that
altar
it
was
a
milestone
on
the
high
road
of
time
and
was
venerable
to
me
at
once
for
its
antiquity
and
for
the
era
at
which
it
had
begun
to
exist
at
the
porch
was
an
ancient
slab
on
which
was
a
coat
of
arms
a
crest
with
a
hand
and
sword
and
a
motto
nos
sic
nostra
the
inscription
said
that
it
was
in
memory
of
michael
mahon
the
kingdom
of
ireland
erected
by
his
children
and
grandchildren
who
was
michael
mahon
some
expatriated
rebel
i
suppose
whose
sword
could
not
defend
him
from
being
barbados
with
so
many
other
poor
wretches
who
were
sent
the
same
road
victims
of
the
of
the
english
government
of
ireland
there
were
plenty
of
them
wandering
about
in
labat
time
ready
as
labat
observes
to
lend
a
help
to
the
french
should
they
take
a
fancy
to
land
a
force
in
the
island
the
churchyard
was
scarcely
so
the
graves
were
planted
with
tropical
shrubs
and
flowers
palms
waved
over
the
square
stone
monuments
stephanotis
and
jessamine
crept
about
the
iron
railings
the
primroses
and
hyacinths
and
violets
with
which
we
dress
the
mounds
under
which
our
friends
are
sleeping
will
not
grow
in
the
tropics
in
the
place
of
them
are
the
exotics
of
our
we
too
are
perhaps
exotics
of
another
kind
in
these
islands
and
may
not
after
all
have
a
long
abiding
place
in
them
colonel
who
with
his
secular
duties
combined
serious
and
spiritual
feeling
was
a
friend
of
the
clergyman
of
john
and
hoped
to
introduce
me
to
him
this
gentleman
however
was
absent
from
home
our
round
was
still
but
half
completed
we
had
to
mount
again
and
go
another
seven
miles
to
inspect
a
police
station
the
police
themselves
were
of
course
blacks
fine
men
in
a
high
state
of
discipline
our
visit
was
not
expected
but
all
was
as
it
should
be
the
rooms
well
swept
and
airy
the
horses
in
good
condition
stables
clean
harness
and
arms
polished
and
ready
for
use
serious
as
might
be
the
trials
of
the
barbadians
and
decrepit
the
financial
condition
there
were
no
symptoms
of
neglect
either
on
the
farms
or
in
the
social
machinery
altogether
we
drove
between
thirty
and
forty
miles
that
morning
we
were
in
time
for
breakfast
after
all
and
i
had
seen
half
the
island
it
is
like
the
isle
of
thanet
or
the
country
between
calais
and
boulogne
one
characteristic
feature
must
not
be
forgotten
there
are
no
rivers
and
no
waterpower
steam
engines
have
been
introduced
but
the
chief
motive
agent
is
still
the
trade
wind
you
see
windmills
everywhere
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
labat
the
planters
are
reproached
as
being
behind
the
age
they
are
told
that
with
the
latest
improvements
they
might
still
defy
their
beetroot
enemy
it
may
be
so
but
a
wind
which
never
rests
is
force
which
costs
little
and
it
is
possible
that
they
understand
their
own
business
best
another
morning
excursion
showed
me
the
rest
of
the
country
and
introduced
me
to
scenes
and
persons
still
more
interesting
sir
graham
briggs
is
perhaps
the
most
distinguished
representative
of
the
old
barbadian
families
he
is
or
was
a
man
of
large
fortune
with
vast
estates
in
this
and
other
islands
a
few
years
ago
when
prospects
were
brighter
he
was
an
advocate
of
the
constitutional
development
so
much
recommended
from
england
the
west
indian
islands
were
to
be
confederated
into
a
dominion
like
that
of
canada
to
take
over
the
responsibilities
of
government
and
to
learn
to
stand
alone
the
decline
in
the
value
of
property
the
general
decay
of
the
white
interest
in
the
islands
and
the
rapid
increase
of
the
blacks
taught
those
who
at
one
time
were
ready
for
the
change
what
the
real
nature
of
it
would
be
they
have
paused
to
consider
and
the
longer
they
consider
the
less
they
like
it
sir
graham
had
called
upon
me
at
government
house
and
had
spoken
fully
and
freely
about
the
offered
american
sugar
treaty
as
a
severe
sufferer
he
was
naturally
irritated
at
the
rejection
of
it
and
in
the
mood
in
which
i
found
him
i
should
think
it
possible
that
if
the
americans
would
hold
their
hands
out
with
an
offer
of
admission
into
the
union
he
and
a
good
many
other
gentlemen
would
meet
them
halfway
he
did
not
say
so
i
conjecture
only
from
natural
probabilities
and
from
what
i
should
feel
myself
if
i
were
in
their
position
happily
the
temptation
can
not
fall
in
their
way
an
american
official
laconically
summed
up
the
situation
to
me
satellites
sir
as
much
as
you
please
but
as
parts
of
the
primary
no
sir
the
americans
will
not
take
them
into
the
union
they
must
remain
therefore
with
their
english
primary
and
make
the
best
of
it
neither
as
satellites
for
they
have
no
proper
motion
of
their
own
nor
as
incorporated
in
the
british
empire
for
they
derive
no
benefit
from
their
connection
with
it
but
as
poor
relations
distantly
acknowledged
i
did
not
expect
that
sir
graham
would
have
more
to
say
to
me
than
he
had
said
already
but
he
was
a
cultivated
and
noteworthy
person
his
house
was
said
to
be
the
most
splendid
of
the
old
barbadian
merchant
palaces
and
i
gratefully
accepted
an
invitation
to
pay
him
a
short
visit
i
started
as
before
in
the
early
morning
before
the
sun
was
above
the
trees
the
road
followed
the
line
of
the
shore
originally
i
believe
barbadoes
was
like
the
antilles
covered
with
forest
in
the
interior
little
remains
save
cabbage
palms
and
detached
clumps
of
mahogany
trees
the
forest
is
gone
and
human
beings
have
taken
the
place
of
it
for
ten
miles
i
was
driving
through
a
string
of
straggling
villages
each
cottage
or
cabin
having
its
small
vegetable
garden
and
clump
of
plantains
being
on
the
western
or
sheltered
side
of
the
island
the
sea
was
smooth
and
edged
with
mangrove
through
which
at
occasional
openings
we
saw
the
shining
water
and
the
white
coral
beach
and
fishing
boats
either
drawn
up
upon
it
or
anchored
outside
with
their
sails
up
trees
had
been
planted
for
shade
among
the
houses
there
were
village
greens
with
great
trees
banyans
and
acacias
mangoes
and
oranges
and
shaddocks
with
their
large
fruit
glowing
among
the
leaves
like
great
golden
melons
the
people
swarmed
children
tumbling
about
half
naked
so
like
each
other
that
one
wondered
whether
their
mothers
knew
their
own
from
their
neighbours
the
wives
selling
flying
fish
of
which
there
are
infinite
numbers
it
was
an
innocent
pretty
scene
one
missed
green
fields
with
cows
upon
them
guinea
grass
which
is
all
that
they
have
makes
excellent
fodder
but
is
ugly
to
look
at
and
is
cut
and
carried
not
eaten
where
it
grows
of
animal
life
there
were
innumerable
donkeys
no
black
man
will
walk
if
he
can
find
a
donkey
to
carry
him
infinite
poultry
and
pigs
familiar
enough
but
not
allowed
a
free
entry
into
the
cabins
as
in
ireland
of
birds
there
was
not
any
great
variety
the
humming
birds
preferred
less
populated
quarters
there
were
small
varieties
of
finches
and
sparrows
and
buntings
winged
atoms
without
beauty
of
form
or
colour
there
were
a
few
wild
pigeons
but
the
prevailing
figure
was
the
barbadian
crow
a
little
fellow
no
bigger
than
a
blackbird
a
diminutive
jackdaw
who
gets
his
living
upon
worms
and
insects
and
parasites
and
so
tame
that
he
would
perch
upon
a
boy
head
if
he
saw
a
chance
of
finding
anything
eatable
there
the
women
dress
ill
in
barbadoes
for
they
imitate
english
ladies
but
no
dress
can
conceal
the
grace
of
their
forms
when
they
are
young
it
struck
père
labat
two
centuries
ago
and
time
and
their
supposed
sufferings
as
slaves
have
made
no
difference
they
work
harder
than
the
men
and
are
used
as
beasts
of
burden
to
fetch
and
carry
but
they
carry
their
loads
on
their
heads
and
thus
from
childhood
have
to
stand
upright
with
the
neck
straight
and
firm
they
do
not
spoil
their
shapes
with
stays
or
their
walk
with
shoes
they
plant
their
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
every
movement
is
elastic
and
rounded
and
the
grace
of
body
gives
or
seems
to
give
grace
also
to
the
eyes
and
expression
poor
things
it
can
not
compensate
for
their
colour
which
now
when
they
are
free
is
harder
to
bear
than
when
they
were
slaves
their
prettiness
such
as
it
is
is
they
grow
old
early
and
an
old
negress
is
always
hideous
after
keeping
by
the
sea
for
an
hour
we
turned
inland
and
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
hill
we
met
my
host
who
transferred
me
to
his
own
carriage
we
had
still
four
or
five
miles
to
go
through
cane
fields
and
among
sugar
mills
at
the
end
of
them
we
came
to
a
grand
avenue
of
cabbage
palms
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
high
how
their
slim
stems
with
their
dense
coronet
of
leaves
survive
a
hurricane
is
one
of
the
west
indian
marvels
they
escape
destruction
by
the
elasticity
with
which
they
yield
to
it
the
branches
which
in
a
calm
stand
out
symmetrically
forming
a
circle
of
which
the
stem
is
the
exact
centre
bend
round
before
a
violent
wind
are
pressed
close
together
and
stream
out
horizontally
like
a
horse
tail
the
avenue
led
up
to
sir
graham
house
which
stands
feet
above
the
sea
the
garden
once
the
wonder
of
the
island
was
running
wild
though
rare
trees
and
shrubs
survived
from
its
ancient
splendour
among
them
were
two
wellingtonias
as
tall
as
the
palms
but
bent
out
of
shape
by
the
trade
winds
passing
through
a
hall
among
a
litter
of
carib
curiosities
we
entered
the
a
magnificent
saloon
extending
with
various
compartments
over
the
greater
part
of
the
story
it
was
filled
with
rare
and
curious
things
gathered
in
the
days
when
sugar
was
a
horn
of
plenty
and
selected
with
the
finest
taste
pictures
engravings
gems
antiquarian
relics
books
maps
and
manuscripts
there
had
been
fine
culture
in
the
west
indies
when
all
these
treasures
were
collected
the
english
settlers
there
like
the
english
in
ireland
had
the
tastes
of
a
grand
race
and
we
shall
miss
both
of
them
when
they
are
overwhelmed
as
they
are
likely
to
be
in
the
revolutionary
tide
sir
graham
was
stemming
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
if
he
was
to
go
under
would
go
under
like
a
gentleman
a
dining
room
almost
as
large
had
once
been
the
scene
of
hospitalities
like
those
which
are
celebrated
by
tom
cringle
a
broad
staircase
led
up
from
the
hall
to
long
galleries
out
of
which
bedrooms
opened
with
cool
deep
balconies
and
the
universal
green
blinds
it
was
a
palace
with
which
aladdin
himself
might
have
been
satisfied
one
of
those
which
had
stirred
the
envying
admiration
of
foreign
travellers
in
the
last
century
one
of
many
then
now
probably
the
last
surviving
representative
of
indian
civilisation
like
other
forms
of
human
life
it
has
had
its
day
and
could
not
last
for
ever
something
better
may
grow
in
the
place
of
it
but
also
something
worse
may
grow
the
example
of
hayti
ought
to
suggest
misgivings
to
the
most
ardent
philonegro
enthusiast
west
indian
cookery
was
famous
over
the
world
père
labat
devotes
at
least
a
thousand
pages
to
the
dishes
compounded
of
the
spices
and
fruits
of
the
islands
and
their
fish
and
fowl
carib
tradition
was
developed
by
artists
from
london
and
paris
the
caribs
according
to
labat
only
ate
one
another
for
ceremony
and
on
state
occasions
their
common
diet
was
as
excellent
as
it
was
innocent
and
they
had
ascertained
by
careful
experience
the
culinary
and
medicinal
virtues
of
every
animal
and
plant
around
them
tom
cringle
is
eloquent
on
the
same
subject
but
with
less
scientific
knowledge
my
own
unfortunately
is
less
than
his
and
i
can
do
no
justice
at
all
to
sir
graham
entertainment
of
me
i
can
but
say
that
he
treated
me
to
a
west
indian
banquet
of
the
old
sort
infinite
in
variety
and
with
subtle
differences
of
flavour
for
which
no
language
provides
names
the
wine
laid
up
when
pitt
was
prime
minister
and
the
days
of
liberty
as
yet
were
not
was
as
admirable
as
the
dishes
and
the
fruit
more
exquisite
than
either
such
pineapples
such
shaddocks
i
had
never
tasted
before
and
shall
never
taste
again
hospitable
generous
splendid
as
was
sir
graham
reception
of
me
it
was
nevertheless
easy
to
see
that
the
prospects
of
the
island
sat
heavy
upon
him
we
had
a
long
conversation
when
breakfast
was
over
which
if
it
added
nothing
new
to
what
i
had
heard
before
deepened
and
widened
the
impression
of
it
the
english
west
indies
like
other
parts
of
the
world
are
going
through
a
silent
revolution
elsewhere
the
revolution
as
we
hope
is
a
transition
state
a
new
birth
a
passing
away
of
what
is
old
and
worn
out
that
a
fresh
and
healthier
order
may
rise
in
its
place
in
the
west
indies
the
most
sanguine
of
mortals
will
find
it
difficult
to
entertain
any
such
hope
at
all
we
have
been
a
ruling
power
there
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
whites
whom
we
planted
as
our
representatives
are
drifting
into
helplessness
and
they
regard
england
and
england
policy
as
the
principal
cause
of
it
the
blacks
whom
in
a
fit
of
virtuous
benevolence
we
emancipated
do
not
feel
that
they
are
particularly
obliged
to
us
they
think
if
they
think
at
all
that
they
were
ill
treated
originally
and
have
received
no
more
than
was
due
to
them
and
that
perhaps
it
was
not
benevolence
at
all
on
our
part
but
a
desire
to
free
ourselves
from
the
reproach
of
slaveholding
at
any
rate
the
tendencies
now
in
operation
are
loosening
the
hold
which
we
possess
on
the
islands
and
the
longer
they
last
the
looser
that
hold
will
become
french
influence
is
in
no
danger
of
dying
out
in
martinique
and
guadaloupe
the
spanish
race
is
not
dying
in
cuba
and
puerto
rico
england
will
soon
be
no
more
than
a
name
in
barbadoes
and
the
antilles
having
acquitted
our
conscience
by
emancipation
we
have
left
our
west
indian
interest
to
sink
or
swim
our
principle
has
been
to
leave
each
part
of
our
empire
except
the
east
indies
to
take
care
of
itself
we
give
the
various
inhabitants
liberty
and
what
we
understand
by
fair
play
that
we
have
any
further
moral
responsibilities
towards
them
we
do
not
imagine
even
in
our
dreams
when
they
have
ceased
to
be
of
commercial
importance
to
us
and
we
assume
that
the
honour
of
being
british
subjects
will
suffice
to
secure
their
allegiance
it
will
not
suffice
as
we
shall
eventually
discover
we
have
decided
that
if
the
west
indies
are
to
become
again
prosperous
they
must
recover
by
their
own
energy
our
other
colonies
can
do
without
help
why
not
they
we
ought
to
remember
that
they
are
not
like
the
other
colonies
we
occupied
them
at
a
time
when
slavery
was
considered
a
lawful
institution
profitable
to
ourselves
and
useful
to
the
souls
of
the
negroes
who
were
brought
by
it
within
reach
of
salvation
we
became
ourselves
the
chief
slave
dealers
in
the
world
we
peopled
our
islands
with
a
population
of
blacks
more
dense
by
far
in
proportion
to
the
whites
than
france
or
spain
ever
ventured
to
do
we
did
not
recognise
as
the
french
and
spaniards
did
that
if
our
western
colonies
were
permanently
to
belong
to
us
we
must
occupy
them
ourselves
we
thought
only
of
the
immediate
profit
which
was
to
be
gathered
out
of
the
slave
gangs
and
the
disproportion
of
the
two
races
always
dangerously
large
has
increased
with
velocity
since
the
emancipation
it
is
now
beyond
control
on
the
old
lines
the
scanty
whites
are
told
that
they
must
work
out
their
own
salvation
on
equal
terms
with
their
old
servants
the
relation
is
an
impossible
one
the
independent
energy
which
we
may
fairly
look
for
in
australia
and
new
zealand
is
not
to
be
looked
for
in
jamaica
and
barbadoes
and
the
problem
must
have
a
new
solution
confederation
is
to
be
the
remedy
we
are
told
let
the
islands
be
combined
under
a
constitution
the
whites
collectively
will
then
be
a
considerable
body
and
can
assert
themselves
successfully
confederation
is
as
i
said
before
of
the
movement
in
trinidad
but
a
turn
of
the
kaleidoscope
the
same
pieces
with
a
new
pattern
a
west
indian
dominion
is
possible
only
with
a
full
negro
vote
if
the
whites
are
to
combine
so
will
the
blacks
it
will
be
a
rule
by
the
blacks
and
for
the
blacks
let
a
generation
or
two
pass
by
and
carry
away
with
them
the
old
traditions
and
an
english
will
be
found
presiding
over
a
black
council
delivering
the
speeches
made
for
him
by
a
black
prime
minister
and
how
long
could
this
endure
no
english
gentleman
would
consent
to
occupy
so
absurd
a
situation
the
two
races
are
not
equal
and
will
not
blend
if
the
white
people
do
not
depart
of
themselves
black
legislation
will
make
it
impossible
for
any
of
them
to
stay
who
would
not
be
better
out
of
the
way
the
protestants
will
leave
ireland
if
there
is
an
irish
catholic
parliament
in
college
green
the
whites
for
the
same
reason
will
leave
the
west
indies
and
in
one
and
the
other
the
connection
with
the
british
empire
will
disappear
along
with
them
it
must
be
so
only
politicians
whose
horizon
does
not
extend
beyond
their
personal
future
and
whose
ambition
is
only
to
secure
the
immediate
triumph
of
their
party
can
expect
anything
else
before
my
stay
at
barbadoes
ended
i
had
an
opportunity
of
meeting
at
dinner
a
negro
of
pure
blood
who
has
risen
to
eminence
by
his
own
talent
and
character
he
has
held
the
office
of
he
is
now
chief
justice
of
the
island
exceptions
are
supposed
proverbially
to
prove
nothing
or
to
prove
the
opposite
of
what
they
appear
to
prove
when
a
particular
phenomenon
occurs
rarely
the
probabilities
are
strong
against
the
recurrence
of
it
having
heard
the
craniological
and
other
objections
to
the
supposed
identity
of
the
negro
and
white
races
i
came
to
the
opinion
long
ago
in
africa
and
i
have
seen
no
reason
to
change
it
that
whether
they
are
of
one
race
or
not
there
is
no
original
or
congenital
difference
of
capacity
between
them
any
more
than
there
is
between
a
black
horse
and
a
black
dog
and
a
white
horse
and
a
white
dog
with
the
same
chances
and
with
the
same
treatment
i
believe
that
distinguished
men
would
be
produced
equally
from
both
races
and
success
is
an
additional
evidence
of
it
but
it
does
not
follow
that
what
can
be
done
eventually
can
be
done
immediately
and
the
gulf
which
divides
the
colours
is
no
arbitrary
prejudice
but
has
been
opened
by
the
centuries
of
training
and
discipline
which
have
given
us
the
start
in
the
race
we
set
it
down
to
slavery
it
would
be
far
truer
to
set
it
down
to
freedom
the
african
blacks
have
been
free
enough
for
thousands
perhaps
for
tens
of
thousands
of
years
and
it
has
been
the
absence
of
restraint
which
has
prevented
them
from
becoming
civilised
generation
has
followed
generation
and
the
children
are
as
like
their
father
as
the
successive
generations
of
apes
the
whites
it
is
likely
enough
succeeded
one
another
with
the
same
similarity
for
a
long
series
of
ages
it
is
now
supposed
that
the
human
race
has
been
upon
the
planet
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
at
least
and
the
first
traces
of
civilisation
can
not
be
thrown
back
at
farthest
beyond
six
thousand
during
all
those
ages
mankind
went
on
treading
in
the
same
steps
century
after
century
making
no
more
advance
than
the
birds
and
beasts
in
egypt
or
in
india
or
one
knows
not
where
accident
or
natural
development
quickened
into
life
our
moral
and
intellectual
faculties
and
these
faculties
have
grown
into
what
we
now
experience
not
in
the
freedom
in
which
the
modern
takes
delight
but
under
the
sharp
rule
of
the
strong
over
the
weak
of
the
wise
over
the
unwise
our
own
race
has
become
capable
of
only
after
a
thousand
years
of
civil
and
spiritual
authority
european
government
european
instruction
continued
steadily
till
his
natural
tendencies
are
superseded
by
a
higher
instinct
may
shorten
the
probation
period
of
the
negro
individual
blacks
of
exceptional
quality
like
frederick
douglas
in
america
or
the
chief
justice
of
barbadoes
will
avail
themselves
of
opportunities
to
rise
and
the
freest
opportunities
ought
to
be
offered
them
but
it
is
as
certain
as
any
future
event
can
be
that
if
we
give
the
negroes
as
a
body
the
political
powers
which
we
claim
for
ourselves
they
will
use
them
only
to
their
own
injury
they
will
slide
back
into
their
old
condition
and
the
chance
will
be
gone
of
lifting
them
to
the
level
to
which
we
have
no
right
to
say
that
they
are
incapable
of
rising
chief
justice
r
owes
his
elevation
to
his
english
environment
and
his
english
legal
training
he
would
not
pretend
that
he
could
have
made
himself
what
he
is
in
hayti
or
in
dahomey
let
english
authority
die
away
and
the
average
black
nature
such
as
it
now
is
be
left
free
to
assert
itself
and
there
will
be
no
more
negroes
like
him
in
barbadoes
or
anywhere
naturally
i
found
him
profoundly
interested
in
the
late
revelations
of
the
state
of
hayti
sir
spenser
john
an
english
official
after
residing
for
twelve
years
in
port
au
prince
had
in
a
published
narrative
with
many
details
and
particulars
declared
that
the
republic
of
toussaint
the
idol
of
all
believers
in
the
new
gospel
of
liberty
had
after
ninety
years
of
independence
become
a
land
where
cannibalism
could
be
practised
with
impunity
the
african
obeah
the
worship
of
serpents
and
trees
and
stones
after
smouldering
in
all
the
west
indies
in
the
form
of
witchcraft
and
poisoning
had
broken
out
in
hayti
in
all
its
old
hideousness
children
were
sacrificed
as
in
the
old
days
of
moloch
and
were
devoured
with
horrid
ceremony
salted
limbs
being
preserved
and
sold
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
were
unable
to
attend
the
full
solemnities
that
a
man
in
the
position
of
a
british
resident
should
have
ventured
on
a
statement
which
if
untrue
would
be
ruinous
to
himself
appeared
in
a
high
degree
improbable
yet
one
had
to
set
one
incredibility
against
another
notwithstanding
the
character
of
the
evidence
when
i
went
out
to
the
west
indies
i
was
still
unbelieving
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
credit
that
in
an
island
nominally
catholic
where
the
french
language
was
spoken
and
there
were
cathedrals
and
churches
and
priests
and
missionaries
so
horrid
a
revival
of
could
have
been
really
possible
all
the
inquiries
which
i
had
been
able
to
make
from
american
and
other
officers
who
had
been
in
hayti
confirmed
sir
john
story
i
had
hardly
found
a
person
who
entertained
a
doubt
of
it
i
was
perplexed
and
uncertain
when
the
chief
justice
opened
the
subject
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
had
i
been
convinced
i
should
have
turned
the
conversation
but
i
was
not
convinced
and
i
was
not
afraid
to
say
so
i
reminded
him
of
the
universal
conviction
through
europe
that
the
jews
were
habitually
guilty
of
sacrificing
children
also
there
had
been
detailed
instances
alleged
offenders
had
been
brought
before
courts
of
justice
at
any
time
for
the
last
six
hundred
years
witnesses
had
been
found
to
swear
to
facts
which
had
been
accepted
as
conclusive
wretched
creatures
in
henry
iii
time
had
been
dragged
by
dozens
at
tails
through
the
streets
of
london
broken
on
the
wheel
or
torn
to
pieces
by
infuriated
mobs
even
within
the
last
two
years
the
same
accusation
had
been
brought
forward
in
russia
and
germany
and
had
been
established
apparently
by
adequate
proof
so
far
as
popular
conviction
of
the
guilt
of
the
jews
was
an
evidence
against
them
nothing
could
be
stronger
and
no
charge
could
be
without
foundation
on
ordinary
principles
of
evidence
which
revived
so
often
and
in
so
many
places
and
yet
many
persons
i
said
and
myself
among
them
believed
that
although
the
accusers
were
perfectly
sincere
the
guilt
of
the
jews
was
from
end
to
end
an
hallucination
of
hatred
i
had
looked
into
the
particulars
of
some
of
the
trials
they
were
like
the
trials
for
witchcraft
the
belief
had
created
the
fact
and
accusation
was
itself
evidence
i
was
prepared
to
find
these
stories
of
child
murder
in
hayti
were
bred
similarly
of
prejudice
had
the
chief
justice
caught
at
my
suggestion
with
any
eagerness
i
should
have
suspected
it
myself
his
grave
diffidence
and
continued
hesitation
in
offering
an
opinion
confirmed
me
in
my
own
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
hayti
to
learn
what
i
could
on
the
spot
i
could
not
expect
that
i
on
a
flying
visit
could
see
deeper
into
the
truth
than
sir
spenser
john
had
seen
but
at
least
i
should
not
take
with
me
a
mind
already
made
up
and
i
was
not
given
to
credulity
he
took
leave
of
me
with
an
expression
of
passionate
anxiety
that
it
might
be
found
possible
to
remove
so
black
a
stain
from
his
unfortunate
race
footnotes
as
i
correct
the
proofs
i
learn
to
my
great
sorrow
that
sir
graham
is
dead
i
have
lost
in
him
a
lately
made
but
valued
friend
and
the
colony
has
lost
the
ablest
of
its
legislators
it
was
on
this
ground
alone
that
slavery
was
permitted
in
the
french
islands

conversation
with
an
american
constitution
of
dominica
land
at
roseau
beyond
all
the
west
indian
islands
i
had
been
curious
to
see
dominica
it
was
the
scene
of
rodney
great
fight
on
april
it
was
the
most
beautiful
of
the
antilles
and
the
least
known
a
tribe
of
aboriginal
caribs
still
lingered
in
the
forests
retaining
the
old
look
and
the
old
language
and
except
that
they
no
longer
ate
their
prisoners
retaining
their
old
habits
they
were
skilful
fishermen
skilful
basket
makers
skilful
in
many
curious
arts
the
island
lies
between
martinique
and
guadaloupe
and
is
one
of
the
group
now
called
leeward
islands
as
distinguished
from
lucia
vincent
grenada
which
form
the
windward
the
early
geographers
drew
the
line
differently
and
more
rationally
the
main
direction
of
the
trade
winds
is
from
east
to
west
to
them
the
windward
islands
were
the
whole
chain
of
the
antilles
which
form
the
eastern
side
of
the
caribbean
sea
the
leeward
were
the
great
islands
on
the
west
of
it
cuba
domingo
puerto
rico
and
jamaica
the
modern
division
corresponds
to
no
natural
phenomenon
the
drift
of
the
trades
is
rather
from
the
than
from
the
and
the
names
serve
only
now
to
describe
our
own
not
very
successful
political
groupings
dominica
cuts
in
two
the
french
west
indian
possessions
the
french
took
it
originally
from
the
spaniards
occupied
it
colonised
it
planted
in
it
their
religion
and
their
language
and
fought
desperately
to
maintain
their
possession
lord
rodney
to
whom
we
owe
our
own
position
in
the
west
indies
insisted
that
dominica
must
belong
to
us
to
hold
the
french
in
check
and
regarded
it
as
the
most
important
of
all
our
stations
there
rodney
made
it
english
and
english
it
has
ever
since
remained
in
spite
of
the
furious
efforts
which
france
made
to
recover
an
island
which
she
so
highly
valued
during
the
napoleon
wars
i
was
anxious
to
learn
what
we
had
made
of
a
place
which
we
had
fought
so
hard
for
though
dominica
is
the
most
mountainous
of
all
the
antilles
it
is
split
into
many
valleys
of
exquisite
fertility
through
each
there
runs
a
full
and
ample
river
swarming
with
fish
and
yielding
waterpower
enough
to
drive
all
the
mills
which
industry
could
build
in
these
valleys
and
on
the
rich
levels
along
the
shore
the
french
had
once
their
cane
fields
and
orange
gardens
their
pineapple
beds
and
indigo
plantations
labat
who
travelled
through
the
island
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
found
it
at
that
time
chiefly
occupied
by
caribs
with
his
hungry
appetite
for
knowledge
he
was
a
guest
in
their
villages
acquainted
himself
with
their
characters
and
habits
and
bribed
out
of
them
by
lavish
presents
of
brandy
the
secrets
of
their
medicines
and
poisons
the
père
was
a
clever
curious
man
with
a
genial
human
sympathy
about
him
and
was
indulgent
to
the
faults
which
the
poor
coloured
sinners
fell
into
from
never
having
known
better
he
tried
to
make
christians
of
them
they
were
willing
to
be
baptised
as
often
as
he
liked
for
a
glass
of
brandy
but
he
was
not
very
angry
when
he
found
that
the
christianity
went
no
deeper
moral
virtues
he
concluded
charitably
could
no
more
be
expected
out
of
a
carib
than
reason
and
good
sense
out
of
a
woman
at
roseau
the
capital
he
fell
in
with
the
then
queen
of
dominica
a
madame
ouvernard
a
carib
of
pure
blood
who
in
her
time
of
youth
and
beauty
had
been
the
mistress
of
an
english
governor
of
kitts
when
labat
saw
her
she
was
a
hundred
years
old
with
a
family
of
children
and
grandchildren
she
was
a
grand
old
lady
unclothed
almost
absolutely
bent
double
so
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
nothing
of
her
face
could
be
seen
labat
however
presented
her
with
a
couple
of
bottles
of
eau
de
vie
under
the
influence
of
which
she
lifted
up
to
him
a
pair
of
still
brilliant
eyes
and
a
fair
mouthful
of
teeth
they
did
very
well
together
and
on
parting
they
exchanged
presents
in
homeric
fashion
she
loading
him
with
baskets
of
fruit
he
giving
a
box
in
return
full
of
pins
and
needles
knives
and
scissors
labat
was
a
student
of
languages
before
philology
had
become
a
science
he
discovered
from
the
language
of
the
caribs
that
they
were
north
american
indians
they
called
themselves
which
meant
from
over
sea
their
dialect
was
almost
identical
with
what
he
had
heard
spoken
in
florida
they
were
cannibals
but
of
a
peculiar
kind
human
flesh
was
not
their
ordinary
food
but
they
or
dried
the
limbs
of
distinguished
enemies
whom
they
had
killed
in
battle
and
handed
them
round
to
be
gnawed
at
special
festivals
they
were
a
pleasant
race
capital
shots
with
bows
and
arrows
and
ready
to
do
anything
he
asked
in
return
for
brandy
they
killed
a
hammer
shark
for
his
amusement
by
diving
under
the
monster
and
stabbing
him
with
knives
as
to
their
religion
they
had
no
objection
to
anything
but
their
real
belief
was
in
a
sort
of
devil
soon
after
labat
visit
the
french
came
in
drove
the
caribs
into
the
mountains
introduced
negro
slaves
and
an
ordered
form
of
society
madame
ouvernard
and
her
court
went
to
their
own
place
canes
were
planted
and
indigo
and
coffee
a
cathedral
was
built
at
roseau
and
parish
churches
were
scattered
about
the
island
there
were
convents
of
nuns
and
houses
of
friars
and
a
fort
at
the
port
with
a
garrison
in
it
the
french
might
have
been
there
till
now
had
not
we
turned
them
out
some
ninety
years
ago
english
enterprise
then
setting
in
that
direction
under
the
impulse
of
rodney
victories
i
was
myself
about
to
see
the
improvements
which
we
had
introduced
into
an
acquisition
which
had
cost
us
so
dear
i
was
to
be
dropped
at
roseau
by
the
mail
steamer
from
barbadoes
to
thomas
on
our
way
we
touched
at
lucia
another
once
famous
possession
of
ours
this
island
was
once
french
also
rodney
took
it
in
it
was
the
only
one
of
the
antilles
which
was
left
to
us
in
the
reverses
which
followed
the
capitulation
of
york
town
it
was
in
the
harbour
at
castries
the
chief
port
that
rodney
collected
the
fleet
which
fought
and
won
the
great
battle
with
the
count
de
grasse
at
the
peace
of
versailles
lucia
was
restored
to
france
but
was
retaken
in
by
sir
ralph
abercrombie
and
like
dominica
has
ever
since
belonged
to
england
this
too
is
a
beautiful
mountainous
island
twice
as
large
as
barbadoes
in
which
even
at
this
late
day
we
have
suddenly
discovered
that
we
have
an
interest
the
threatened
darien
canal
has
awakened
us
to
a
sense
that
we
require
a
fortified
coaling
station
in
those
quarters
lucia
has
the
greatest
natural
advantages
for
such
a
purpose
and
works
are
already
in
progress
there
and
the
forts
and
barracks
which
had
been
made
over
to
snakes
and
lizards
are
again
to
be
occupied
by
english
troops
we
sailed
one
evening
from
barbadoes
in
the
grey
of
the
next
morning
we
were
in
the
passage
between
lucia
and
vincent
just
under
the
which
were
soaring
grandly
above
us
in
the
twilight
the
pitons
are
two
conical
mountains
rising
straight
out
of
the
sea
at
the
southern
end
of
lucia
one
of
them
feet
high
the
other
a
few
feet
lower
symmetrical
in
shape
like
sugar
loaves
and
so
steep
as
to
be
inaccessible
to
any
one
but
a
member
of
the
alpine
club
tradition
says
that
four
english
seamen
belonging
to
the
fleet
did
once
set
out
to
climb
the
loftier
of
the
two
they
were
watched
in
their
ascent
through
a
telescope
when
halfway
up
one
of
them
was
seen
to
drop
while
three
went
on
a
few
hundred
feet
higher
a
second
dropped
and
afterwards
a
third
one
had
almost
reached
the
summit
when
he
fell
also
no
account
of
what
had
befallen
them
ever
reached
their
ship
they
were
supposed
to
have
been
bitten
by
the
fer
de
lance
the
deadliest
snake
in
lucia
and
perhaps
in
the
world
who
had
resented
and
punished
their
intrusion
into
regions
where
they
had
no
business
such
is
the
local
legend
born
probably
out
of
the
terror
of
a
reptile
which
is
no
legend
at
all
but
a
living
and
very
active
reality
i
had
gone
on
deck
on
hearing
where
we
were
and
saw
the
twin
grey
peaks
high
above
me
in
the
sky
the
last
stars
glimmering
over
their
tops
and
the
waves
washing
against
the
black
precipices
at
their
base
the
night
had
been
rough
and
a
considerable
sea
was
running
which
changed
however
to
an
absolute
calm
when
we
had
passed
the
pitons
and
were
under
the
lee
of
the
island
i
could
then
observe
the
peculiar
blue
of
the
water
which
i
was
told
that
i
should
find
at
lucia
and
dominica
i
have
seen
the
sea
of
very
beautiful
colours
in
several
parts
of
the
world
but
i
never
saw
any
which
equalled
this
i
do
not
know
the
cause
the
depth
is
very
great
even
close
to
the
shore
the
islands
are
merely
volcanic
mountains
with
sides
extremely
steep
the
coral
insect
has
made
anchorages
in
the
bays
and
inlets
elsewhere
you
are
out
of
soundings
almost
immediately
as
to
lucia
itself
if
i
had
not
seen
grenada
if
i
had
not
known
what
i
was
about
to
see
in
dominica
i
should
have
thought
it
the
most
exquisite
place
which
nature
had
ever
made
so
perfect
were
the
forms
of
the
hills
the
glens
dividing
them
and
the
high
mountain
ranges
in
the
interior
still
draped
in
the
white
mist
of
morning
here
and
there
along
the
shore
there
were
bright
green
spots
which
meant
cane
fields
sugar
cane
in
these
countries
is
always
called
for
brevity
here
as
elsewhere
the
population
is
almost
entirely
negro
forty
thousand
blacks
and
a
few
hundred
whites
the
ratio
altering
every
year
to
white
disadvantage
the
old
system
has
not
however
disappeared
as
completely
as
in
other
places
there
are
still
white
planters
with
large
estates
which
are
not
encumbered
as
in
barbadoes
they
are
struggling
along
discontented
of
course
but
not
wholly
despondent
the
chief
complaint
is
the
somewhat
weary
one
of
the
laziness
of
the
blacks
who
they
say
will
work
only
when
they
please
and
are
never
fully
awake
except
at
dinner
time
i
do
not
know
that
they
have
a
right
to
expect
anything
else
from
poor
creatures
whom
the
law
calls
human
but
who
to
them
are
only
mechanical
tools
not
so
manageable
as
tools
ought
to
be
with
whom
they
have
no
acquaintance
and
no
human
relations
whose
wages
are
but
twopence
an
hour
and
are
diminished
by
fines
at
the
arbitrary
pleasure
of
the
overseer
life
and
hope
and
energy
are
the
qualities
most
needed
when
the
troops
return
there
will
be
a
change
and
spirit
may
be
put
into
them
again
castries
the
old
french
town
lies
at
the
head
of
a
deep
inlet
which
runs
in
among
the
mountains
like
a
fiord
this
is
to
be
the
future
coaling
station
the
mouth
of
the
bay
is
narrow
with
a
high
projecting
on
either
side
of
it
and
can
be
easily
and
cheaply
fortified
there
is
little
or
no
tide
in
these
seas
there
is
depth
of
water
sufficient
in
the
greater
part
of
the
harbour
for
ships
to
anchor
and
turn
and
the
few
coral
shoals
which
would
be
in
the
way
are
being
torn
up
with
dredging
machines
the
island
has
borrowed
seventy
thousand
pounds
on
government
security
to
prepare
for
the
dignity
which
awaits
it
and
for
the
prosperity
which
is
to
follow
there
was
real
work
actively
going
on
a
rare
and
perhaps
unexampled
phenomenon
in
the
english
west
indies
we
brought
up
alongside
of
a
wharf
to
take
in
coal
it
was
a
strange
scene
palms
growing
incongruously
out
of
coal
stores
and
gorgeous
flowering
creepers
climbing
over
the
workmen
sheds
volumes
of
smoke
rose
out
of
the
dredging
engines
and
hovered
over
the
town
we
had
come
back
to
french
costume
again
we
had
left
the
white
dresses
behind
at
barbadoes
and
the
people
at
castries
were
bright
as
parrots
in
crimsons
and
blues
and
greens
but
fine
colours
looked
oddly
out
of
place
by
the
side
of
the
grimy
reproduction
of
england
i
went
on
shore
and
fell
in
with
the
engineer
of
the
works
who
kindly
showed
me
his
plans
of
the
harbour
and
explained
what
was
to
be
done
he
showed
me
also
some
beautiful
large
bivalves
which
had
been
brought
up
in
the
scrapers
out
of
the
coral
they
were
new
to
me
and
new
to
him
though
they
may
be
familiar
enough
to
more
experienced
naturalists
among
other
curiosities
he
had
a
fer
de
lance
lately
killed
and
preserved
in
spirits
a
reddish
brute
about
four
feet
long
and
as
thick
as
a
child
wrist
even
when
dead
i
looked
at
him
respectfully
for
his
bite
is
fatal
and
the
effect
almost
instantaneous
he
is
fearless
and
will
not
like
most
snakes
get
out
of
your
way
if
he
hears
you
coming
but
leaves
you
to
get
out
of
his
he
has
a
bad
habit
too
of
taking
his
walks
at
night
he
prefers
a
path
or
a
road
to
the
grass
and
your
house
or
your
garden
to
the
forest
while
if
you
step
upon
him
you
will
never
do
it
again
they
have
introduced
the
mongoose
who
has
cleared
the
snakes
out
of
jamaica
to
deal
with
him
but
the
mongoose
knows
the
creature
that
he
has
to
encounter
and
as
yet
has
made
little
progress
in
extirpating
him
lucia
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
barbadoes
it
has
no
governor
of
its
own
but
only
an
administrator
indifferently
paid
the
elective
principle
has
not
yet
been
introduced
into
the
legislature
and
perhaps
will
not
be
introduced
since
we
have
discovered
the
island
to
be
of
consequence
to
us
unless
as
part
of
some
general
confederation
the
present
administrator
laborde
a
gentleman
i
suppose
of
french
descent
is
an
elderly
official
and
resides
in
the
old
quarters
of
the
general
of
the
forces
feet
above
the
sea
he
has
large
responsibilities
and
having
had
large
experience
also
seems
fully
equal
to
the
duties
which
attach
to
him
he
can
not
have
the
authority
of
a
complete
governor
or
undertake
independent
enterprises
for
the
benefit
of
the
island
as
a
rajah
brooke
might
do
but
he
walks
steadily
on
in
the
lines
assigned
to
him
lucia
is
better
off
in
this
respect
than
most
of
the
antilles
and
may
revive
perhaps
into
something
like
prosperity
when
the
coaling
station
is
finished
and
under
the
command
of
some
eminent
engineer
officer
laborde
had
invited
us
to
lunch
with
him
horses
were
waiting
for
us
and
we
rode
up
the
old
winding
track
which
led
from
the
town
to
the
barracks
the
heat
below
was
oppressive
but
the
air
cooled
as
we
rose
the
road
is
so
steep
that
resting
places
had
been
provided
at
intervals
where
the
soldiers
could
recover
breath
or
shelter
themselves
from
the
tropical
cataracts
of
rain
which
fall
without
notice
as
if
the
string
had
been
pulled
of
some
celestial
shower
bath
the
trees
branched
thickly
over
it
making
an
impenetrable
shade
till
we
emerged
on
the
plateau
at
the
top
where
we
were
on
comparatively
level
ground
with
the
harbour
immediately
at
our
feet
the
situation
had
been
chosen
by
the
french
when
lucia
was
theirs
the
general
house
now
laborde
residence
is
a
long
airy
building
with
a
deep
colonnade
the
drawing
and
dining
rooms
occupying
the
entire
breadth
of
the
ground
floor
with
doors
and
windows
on
both
sides
for
coolness
and
air
the
western
front
overlooked
the
sea
behind
were
wooded
hills
green
valleys
a
mountain
range
in
the
background
and
the
pitons
blue
in
the
distance
as
we
were
before
our
time
laborde
walked
me
out
to
see
the
old
barracks
magazines
and
water
tanks
they
looked
neglected
and
dilapidated
the
signs
of
decay
being
partly
hid
by
the
creepers
with
which
the
walls
were
overgrown
the
soldiers
quarters
were
occupied
for
the
time
by
a
resident
gentleman
who
attended
to
the
essential
repairs
and
prevented
the
snakes
from
taking
possession
as
they
were
inclined
to
do
i
forget
how
many
of
the
fer
de
lance
sort
he
told
me
he
had
killed
in
the
rooms
since
he
had
lived
in
them
in
the
war
time
we
had
maintained
a
large
establishment
in
lucia
with
what
consequences
to
the
health
of
the
troops
i
could
not
clearly
make
out
one
informant
told
me
that
they
had
died
like
flies
of
yellow
fever
and
that
the
fields
adjoining
were
as
full
of
bodies
as
the
brompton
cemetery
another
that
yellow
fever
had
never
been
known
there
or
any
dangerous
disorder
and
that
if
we
wanted
a
sanitary
station
this
was
the
spot
for
it
many
thousands
of
pounds
will
have
to
be
spent
there
before
the
troops
can
return
but
that
is
our
way
with
the
colonies
to
change
our
minds
every
ten
years
to
do
and
undo
and
do
again
according
to
parliamentary
humours
while
john
bull
pays
the
bill
patiently
for
his
own
irresolution
the
fortress
once
very
strong
is
now
in
ruins
but
i
suppose
will
be
repaired
and
rearmed
unless
we
are
to
trust
to
the
yankees
who
are
supposed
to
have
established
a
in
these
waters
and
will
permit
no
aggressive
action
there
either
by
us
or
against
us
we
walked
round
the
walls
we
saw
the
hill
a
mile
off
from
which
abercrombie
had
battered
out
the
french
having
dragged
his
guns
through
a
roadless
forest
to
a
spot
to
which
there
seemed
no
access
except
on
wings
the
word
was
not
known
in
those
days
what
englishmen
did
once
they
may
do
again
perhaps
if
stormy
days
come
back
the
ruins
themselves
were
silently
impressive
one
could
hear
the
note
of
the
old
bugles
as
they
sounded
the
reveille
and
the
roaring
of
the
de
when
the
shattered
prizes
were
brought
in
from
the
french
fleet
the
signs
of
what
once
had
been
were
still
visible
in
the
parade
ground
in
the
large
mangoes
which
the
soldiers
had
planted
in
the
english
grass
which
they
had
introduced
and
on
which
cattle
were
now
grazing
there
was
a
clump
of
guavas
hitherto
only
known
to
me
in
preserves
i
gathered
a
blossom
as
a
remembrance
white
like
a
large
myrtle
flower
but
heavily
scented
too
heavily
with
an
odour
of
death
about
it
laborde
conversation
was
instructive
his
entertainment
of
us
was
all
which
our
acquired
west
indian
fastidiousness
could
desire
the
inevitable
cigars
followed
and
gave
me
a
beating
at
billiards
there
were
some
lively
young
ladies
in
the
party
and
two
or
three
of
the
ship
officers
the
young
ones
played
lawn
tennis
and
we
old
ones
looked
on
and
wished
the
years
off
our
shoulders
so
passed
the
day
the
sun
was
setting
when
we
mounted
to
ride
down
so
short
is
the
twilight
in
these
latitudes
that
it
was
dark
night
when
we
reached
the
town
and
we
required
the
light
of
the
stars
to
find
our
boat
when
the
coaling
process
was
finished
the
ship
had
been
washed
down
in
our
absence
and
was
anchored
off
beyond
the
reach
of
the
dirt
but
the
ports
were
shut
the
windsails
had
been
taken
down
the
air
in
the
cabins
was
stifling
so
i
stayed
on
deck
till
midnight
with
a
clever
young
american
who
was
among
our
talking
of
many
things
he
was
ardent
confident
but
not
disagreeably
either
one
or
the
other
it
was
rather
a
pleasure
to
hear
a
man
speak
in
these
flabby
uncertain
days
as
if
he
were
sure
of
anything
and
i
had
to
notice
again
as
i
had
often
noticed
before
how
well
informed
casual
american
travellers
are
on
public
affairs
and
how
sensibly
they
can
talk
of
them
he
had
been
much
in
the
west
indies
and
seemed
to
know
them
well
he
said
that
all
the
whites
in
the
islands
wished
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
to
be
taken
into
the
union
but
the
union
government
was
too
wise
to
meddle
with
them
the
trade
would
fall
to
america
of
itself
the
responsibility
and
trouble
might
remain
where
it
was
i
asked
him
about
the
canadian
fishery
dispute
he
thought
it
would
settle
itself
in
time
and
that
nothing
serious
would
come
of
it
washington
cabinet
had
been
a
little
hard
on
england
he
admitted
it
was
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
were
easy
neither
party
could
score
had
been
equally
hard
on
them
about
alaska
he
was
less
satisfied
about
ireland
the
telegraph
had
brought
the
news
of
goschen
defeat
at
liverpool
and
home
rule
which
had
seemed
to
have
been
disposed
of
was
again
within
the
range
of
probabilities
he
was
watching
with
pitying
amusement
like
most
of
his
countrymen
the
weakness
of
will
with
which
england
allowed
herself
to
be
worried
by
so
contemptible
a
business
but
he
did
seem
to
fear
and
i
have
heard
others
of
his
countrymen
say
the
same
that
if
we
let
it
go
on
much
longer
the
americans
may
become
involved
in
the
thing
one
way
or
another
and
trouble
may
rise
about
it
between
the
two
countries
we
weighed
and
i
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
and
so
missed
pigeon
island
where
rodney
fleet
lay
before
the
action
and
the
rock
from
which
through
his
telescope
he
watched
de
grasse
come
out
of
martinique
and
gave
his
own
signal
to
chase
we
rolled
as
usual
between
the
islands
at
daylight
we
were
again
in
shelter
under
martinique
and
again
in
classic
regions
for
close
to
us
was
diamond
rock
once
his
majesty
ship
commissioned
with
crew
and
officers
one
of
those
curious
true
incidents
out
of
which
a
legend
might
have
grown
in
other
times
that
ship
and
mariners
had
been
turned
to
stone
the
rock
a
lonely
pyramid
six
hundred
feet
high
commanded
the
entrance
to
port
royal
in
martinique
lord
howe
took
possession
of
it
sent
guns
up
in
slings
to
the
top
and
left
a
midshipman
with
a
handful
of
men
in
charge
the
gallant
little
fellow
held
his
fortress
for
several
months
peppered
away
at
the
french
and
sent
three
of
their
ships
of
war
to
the
bottom
he
was
blockaded
at
last
by
an
overwhelming
force
no
relief
could
be
spared
for
him
escape
was
impossible
as
he
had
not
so
much
as
a
boat
and
he
capitulated
to
famine
we
stayed
two
hours
under
martinique
i
did
not
land
it
has
been
for
centuries
a
special
object
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
french
government
it
is
well
looked
after
and
considering
the
times
prosperous
it
has
a
fine
garrison
and
a
dockyard
well
furnished
with
frigates
in
the
harbours
ready
for
action
should
occasion
arise
i
should
infer
from
what
i
heard
that
in
the
event
of
war
breaking
out
between
england
and
france
martinique
in
the
present
state
of
preparation
on
both
sides
might
take
possession
of
the
rest
of
the
antilles
with
little
difficulty
three
times
we
took
it
and
we
gave
it
back
again
in
turn
it
may
one
day
perhaps
take
us
and
the
english
of
the
west
indies
become
a
tradition
like
the
buccaneers
the
mountains
of
dominica
are
full
in
sight
from
martinique
the
channel
which
separates
them
is
but
thirty
miles
across
and
the
view
of
dominica
as
you
approach
it
is
extremely
grand
grenada
vincent
lucia
martinique
are
all
volcanic
with
lofty
peaks
and
ridges
but
dominica
was
at
the
centre
of
the
force
which
lifted
the
antilles
out
of
the
ocean
and
the
features
which
are
common
to
all
are
there
in
a
magnified
form
the
mountains
range
from
four
to
five
thousand
feet
in
height
mount
diablot
the
highest
of
them
rises
to
between
five
and
six
thousand
feet
the
mountains
being
the
tallest
in
all
the
group
the
rains
are
also
the
most
violent
and
the
ravines
torn
out
by
the
torrents
are
the
wildest
and
most
magnificent
the
volcanic
forces
are
still
active
there
there
are
sulphur
springs
and
boiling
water
fountains
and
in
a
central
crater
there
is
a
boiling
lake
there
are
strange
creatures
there
besides
great
snakes
harmless
but
ugly
to
look
at
the
diablot
from
which
the
mountain
takes
its
name
a
great
bird
black
as
charcoal
half
raven
half
parrot
which
nests
in
holes
in
the
ground
as
puffins
do
spends
all
the
day
in
them
and
flies
down
to
the
sea
at
night
to
fish
for
its
food
there
were
once
great
numbers
of
these
creatures
and
it
was
a
favourite
amusement
to
hunt
and
drag
them
out
of
their
hiding
places
labat
says
that
they
were
excellent
eating
they
are
confined
now
in
reduced
numbers
to
the
inaccessible
crags
about
the
peak
which
bears
their
name
martinique
has
two
fine
harbours
dominica
has
none
at
the
north
end
of
the
island
there
is
a
bay
named
after
prince
rupert
where
there
is
shelter
from
all
winds
but
the
south
but
neither
there
nor
anywhere
is
there
an
anchorage
which
can
be
depended
upon
in
dangerous
weather
roseau
the
principal
or
only
town
stands
midway
along
the
western
shore
the
roadstead
is
open
but
as
the
prevailing
winds
are
from
the
east
the
island
itself
forms
a
breakwater
except
on
the
rarest
occasions
there
is
neither
surf
nor
swell
there
the
land
shelves
off
rapidly
and
a
gunshot
from
shore
no
cable
can
find
the
bottom
but
there
is
an
anchorage
in
front
of
the
town
and
coasting
smacks
american
schooners
passing
steamers
bring
up
close
under
the
rocks
or
alongside
of
the
jetties
which
are
built
out
from
the
beach
upon
piles
the
situation
of
roseau
is
exceedingly
beautiful
the
sea
is
if
possible
a
deeper
azure
even
than
at
lucia
the
air
more
transparent
the
forests
of
a
lovelier
green
than
i
ever
saw
in
any
other
country
even
the
rain
which
falls
in
such
abundance
falls
often
out
of
a
clear
sky
as
if
not
to
interrupt
the
sunshine
and
a
rainbow
almost
perpetually
hangs
its
arch
over
the
island
roseau
itself
stands
on
a
shallow
promontory
a
long
terrace
of
houses
faces
the
landing
place
at
right
angles
to
the
terrace
straight
streets
strike
backwards
at
intervals
palms
and
bananas
breaking
the
lines
of
roof
at
a
little
distance
you
see
the
towers
of
the
old
french
catholic
cathedral
a
smaller
but
not
anglican
church
and
to
the
right
a
fort
or
the
ruins
of
one
now
used
as
a
police
barrack
over
which
flies
the
english
flag
as
the
symbol
of
our
titular
dominion
beyond
the
fort
is
a
public
garden
with
pretty
trees
in
it
along
the
brow
of
a
precipitous
cliff
at
the
foot
of
which
when
we
landed
lay
at
anchor
a
couple
of
smart
yankee
schooners
and
half
a
dozen
coasting
cutters
while
rounding
inwards
behind
was
a
long
shallow
bay
dotted
over
with
the
sails
of
fishing
boats
white
negro
villages
gleamed
among
the
palms
along
the
shore
and
wooded
mountains
rose
immediately
above
them
it
seemed
an
attractive
innocent
sunny
sort
of
place
very
pleasant
to
spend
a
few
days
in
if
the
inner
side
of
things
corresponded
to
the
appearance
to
a
at
that
calm
scene
it
was
not
easy
to
realise
the
desperate
battles
which
had
been
fought
for
the
possession
of
it
the
gallant
lives
which
had
been
laid
down
under
the
walls
of
that
crumbling
castle
these
cliffs
had
echoed
the
roar
of
rodney
guns
on
the
day
which
saved
the
british
empire
and
the
island
i
was
gazing
at
was
england
salamis
the
organisation
of
the
place
too
seemed
so
far
as
i
could
gather
from
official
books
to
have
been
carefully
attended
to
the
constitution
had
been
touched
and
retouched
by
the
home
authorities
as
if
no
pains
could
be
too
great
to
make
it
worthy
of
a
spot
so
sacred
there
is
an
administrator
which
is
a
longer
word
than
governor
there
is
an
executive
council
a
colonial
secretary
an
an
and
other
such
of
great
charge
there
is
a
legislative
assembly
of
fourteen
members
seven
nominated
by
the
crown
and
seven
elected
by
the
people
and
there
are
revenue
officers
and
excise
officers
inspectors
of
roads
and
civil
engineers
and
school
boards
and
medical
officers
and
registrars
and
magistrates
where
would
political
perfection
be
found
if
not
here
with
such
elaborate
machinery
the
results
of
it
all
in
the
official
reports
seemed
equally
satisfactory
till
you
looked
closely
into
them
the
tariff
of
articles
on
which
duties
were
levied
and
the
list
of
articles
raised
and
exported
seemed
to
show
that
dominica
must
be
a
beehive
of
industry
and
productiveness
the
revenue
indeed
was
a
little
startling
as
the
result
of
this
army
of
officials
eighteen
thousand
pounds
was
the
whole
of
it
scarcely
enough
to
pay
their
salaries
the
population
too
on
whose
good
government
so
much
thought
had
been
expended
was
only
of
these
only
a
hundred
were
english
the
remaining
whites
and
those
in
scanty
numbers
were
french
and
principally
catholics
the
soil
was
as
rich
as
the
richest
in
the
world
the
cultivation
was
growing
annually
less
the
inspector
of
roads
was
likely
to
have
an
easy
task
for
except
close
to
the
town
there
were
no
roads
at
all
on
which
anything
with
wheels
could
travel
the
old
roads
made
by
the
french
having
dropped
into
horse
tracks
and
the
horse
tracks
into
the
beds
of
torrents
why
in
an
island
where
the
resources
of
modern
statesmanship
had
been
applied
so
lavishly
and
with
the
latest
discoveries
in
political
science
the
effect
should
have
so
ill
corresponded
to
the
means
employed
was
a
problem
into
which
it
would
be
curious
to
inquire
the
steamer
set
me
down
upon
the
pier
and
went
on
upon
its
way
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
it
would
return
and
pick
me
up
again
meanwhile
i
was
to
make
the
best
of
my
time
i
had
been
warned
beforehand
that
there
was
no
hotel
in
roseau
where
an
englishman
with
a
susceptible
skin
and
palate
could
survive
more
than
a
week
and
as
i
had
two
weeks
to
provide
for
i
was
uncertain
what
to
do
with
myself
i
was
spared
the
trial
of
the
hotels
by
the
liberality
of
her
majesty
representative
in
the
colony
captain
churchill
the
administrator
of
the
island
had
heard
that
i
was
coming
there
and
i
was
met
on
the
landing
stage
by
a
message
from
him
inviting
me
to
be
his
guest
during
my
stay
two
tall
handsome
black
girls
seized
my
bags
tossed
them
on
their
heads
and
strode
off
with
a
light
step
in
front
of
me
cutting
jokes
with
their
friends
i
following
and
my
mind
misgiving
me
that
i
was
myself
the
object
of
their
wit
i
was
anxious
to
see
captain
churchill
for
i
had
heard
much
of
him
the
warmest
affection
had
been
expressed
for
him
personally
and
concern
for
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
notwithstanding
latest
discoveries
of
political
science
the
constitution
was
still
imperfect
the
administrator
to
begin
with
is
allowed
a
salary
of
only
a
year
that
is
not
much
for
the
chief
of
such
an
army
of
officials
and
the
hospitalities
and
social
civilities
which
smooth
the
way
in
such
situations
are
beyond
his
means
his
business
is
to
preside
at
the
council
where
the
official
and
the
elected
members
being
equally
balanced
and
almost
invariably
dividing
one
against
the
other
his
duty
is
to
give
the
casting
vote
he
can
not
give
it
against
his
own
officers
and
thus
the
machine
is
contrived
to
create
the
largest
amount
of
friction
and
to
insure
the
highest
amount
of
unpopularity
to
the
administrator
his
situation
is
the
more
difficult
because
the
european
element
in
roseau
small
as
it
is
at
best
is
more
french
than
english
the
priests
the
sisterhoods
are
french
or
a
french
patois
is
the
language
of
the
blacks
they
are
almost
to
a
man
catholics
and
to
the
french
they
look
as
their
natural
leaders
england
has
done
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
introduce
her
own
civilisation
and
thus
dominica
is
english
only
in
name
should
war
come
a
boatload
of
soldiers
from
martinique
would
suffice
to
recover
it
not
a
black
in
the
whole
island
would
draw
a
trigger
in
defence
of
english
authority
and
except
the
crown
officials
not
half
a
dozen
europeans
the
administrator
can
do
nothing
to
improve
this
state
of
things
he
is
too
poor
to
open
government
house
to
the
roseau
shopkeepers
and
to
bid
for
social
popularity
he
is
no
one
he
goes
in
and
out
unnoticed
and
flits
about
like
a
bat
in
the
twilight
he
can
do
no
good
and
from
the
nature
of
the
system
on
the
construction
of
which
so
much
care
was
expended
no
one
else
can
do
any
good
the
maximum
of
expense
the
minimum
of
benefit
to
the
island
is
all
that
has
come
of
it
meanwhile
the
island
drifts
along
without
credit
to
borrow
money
and
therefore
escaping
bankruptcy
the
blacks
there
as
everywhere
are
happy
with
their
yams
and
cocoa
nuts
and
land
crabs
they
desire
nothing
better
than
they
have
and
do
not
imagine
that
they
have
any
rulers
unless
agitated
by
the
elected
members
these
gentlemen
would
like
the
official
situations
for
themselves
as
in
trinidad
and
they
occasionally
attempt
a
stir
with
partial
success
otherwise
the
island
goes
on
in
a
state
of
torpid
content
captain
churchill
quiet
and
gentlemanlike
gives
no
personal
offence
but
popularity
he
can
not
hope
for
having
no
means
of
recommending
himself
the
only
really
powerful
europeans
are
the
catholic
bishop
and
the
priests
and
sisterhoods
they
are
looked
up
to
with
genuine
respect
they
are
reaping
the
harvest
of
the
long
and
honourable
efforts
of
the
french
clergy
in
all
their
west
indian
possessions
to
make
the
blacks
into
catholic
christians
in
the
christian
part
of
it
they
have
succeeded
but
moderately
but
such
religion
as
exists
in
the
island
is
mainly
what
they
have
introduced
and
taught
and
they
have
a
distinct
influence
which
we
ourselves
have
not
tried
to
rival
but
we
have
been
too
long
toiling
up
the
paved
road
to
captain
churchill
house
my
guides
led
me
past
the
fort
where
they
exchanged
shots
with
the
lounging
black
police
past
the
english
church
which
stood
buried
in
trees
the
churchyard
prettily
planted
with
tropical
flowers
the
sun
was
dazzling
the
heat
was
intense
and
the
path
which
led
through
it
if
not
apparently
much
used
looked
shady
and
cool
a
few
more
steps
brought
us
to
the
gate
of
the
residence
where
captain
churchill
had
his
quarters
in
the
absence
of
the
of
the
leeward
islands
whose
visits
were
few
and
brief
in
the
event
of
the
governor
arrival
he
removed
to
a
cottage
in
the
hills
the
house
was
handsome
the
gardens
well
kept
a
broad
walk
led
up
to
the
door
a
hedge
of
lime
trees
closely
clipt
on
one
side
of
it
on
the
other
a
lawn
with
orange
trees
oleanders
and
hibiscus
palms
of
all
varieties
and
almond
trees
which
in
dominica
grow
into
giants
their
broad
leaves
turning
crimson
before
they
fall
like
the
virginia
creeper
we
reached
the
entrance
of
the
house
by
wide
stone
steps
where
countless
lizards
were
lazily
basking
through
the
bars
of
the
railings
on
each
side
of
them
there
were
intertwined
the
runners
of
the
largest
and
most
powerfully
scented
stephanotis
which
i
have
ever
seen
captain
churchill
one
of
the
marlborough
churchills
received
me
with
more
than
cordiality
society
is
not
abundant
in
his
barataria
and
perhaps
as
coming
from
england
i
was
welcome
to
him
in
his
solitude
his
wife
an
english
creole
that
is
of
pure
english
blood
but
born
in
the
island
was
as
hospitable
as
her
husband
they
would
not
let
me
feel
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
set
me
at
my
ease
in
a
moment
with
a
warmth
which
was
evidently
unassumed
captain
was
lame
having
hurt
his
foot
in
a
day
or
two
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
mount
his
horse
again
when
we
were
to
ride
together
and
see
the
curiosities
meanwhile
he
talked
sorrowfully
enough
of
his
own
situation
and
the
general
helplessness
of
it
a
man
whose
feet
are
chained
and
whose
hands
are
in
manacles
is
not
to
be
found
fault
with
if
he
can
not
use
either
he
is
not
intended
to
use
either
the
duty
of
an
administrator
of
dominica
it
appears
is
to
sit
still
and
do
nothing
and
to
watch
the
flickering
in
the
socket
of
the
last
remains
of
english
influence
and
authority
individually
he
was
on
good
terms
with
everyone
with
the
catholic
bishop
especially
who
to
his
regret
and
mine
was
absent
at
the
time
of
my
visit
his
establishment
was
remarkable
it
consisted
of
two
black
girls
a
cook
and
a
parlourmaid
who
everything
and
i
am
bound
to
say
was
done
well
enough
to
please
the
most
fastidious
nicety
the
cooking
was
excellent
the
rooms
which
were
handsomely
furnished
were
kept
as
well
and
in
as
good
order
as
in
the
churchills
ancestral
palace
at
blenheim
dominica
has
a
bad
name
for
vermin
i
had
been
threatened
with
centipedes
and
scorpions
in
my
bedroom
i
had
been
warned
there
as
everywhere
in
the
west
indies
never
to
walk
across
the
floor
with
bare
feet
lest
a
land
crab
should
lay
hold
of
my
toe
or
a
jigger
should
bite
a
hole
in
it
lay
its
eggs
there
and
bring
me
into
the
hands
of
the
surgeon
never
while
i
was
captain
guest
did
i
see
either
centipede
or
scorpion
or
jigger
or
any
other
unclean
beast
in
any
room
of
which
these
girls
had
charge
even
mosquitoes
did
not
trouble
me
so
skilfully
and
carefully
they
arranged
the
curtains
they
were
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the
french
islands
something
like
the
moorish
slaves
whom
one
sees
in
pictures
of
eastern
palaces
they
flitted
about
silent
on
their
shoeless
feet
never
stumbled
or
upset
chairs
or
plates
or
dishes
but
waited
noiselessly
like
a
pair
of
elves
and
were
always
in
their
place
when
wanted
one
had
heard
much
of
the
idleness
and
carelessness
of
negro
servants
in
no
part
of
the
globe
have
i
ever
seen
household
work
done
so
well
by
two
pairs
of
hands
of
their
morals
i
know
nothing
it
is
usually
said
that
negro
girls
have
none
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
perfectly
modest
and
innocent
i
asked
in
wonder
what
wages
were
paid
to
these
black
fairies
believing
that
at
no
price
at
all
could
the
match
of
them
be
found
in
england
i
was
informed
that
they
had
three
shillings
a
week
each
and
themselves
found
their
own
food
and
clothes
and
this
was
above
the
usual
rate
as
government
house
was
expected
to
be
liberal
the
scale
of
wages
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
labour
in
the
west
indies
i
could
easily
believe
the
truth
of
what
i
had
been
often
told
that
free
labour
is
more
economical
to
the
employer
than
slave
labour
the
views
from
the
drawing
room
windows
were
enchantingly
beautiful
it
is
not
the
form
only
in
these
west
indian
landscapes
or
the
colour
only
but
form
and
colour
seen
through
an
atmosphere
of
very
peculiar
transparency
on
one
side
we
looked
up
a
mountain
gorge
the
slopes
covered
with
forest
a
bold
lofty
crag
jutting
out
from
them
brown
and
bare
and
the
mountain
ridge
behind
half
buried
in
mist
from
the
other
window
we
had
the
botanical
gardens
the
bay
beyond
them
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
and
on
the
farther
side
of
it
a
few
miles
off
an
island
fortress
which
the
marquis
de
bouillé
of
revolution
notoriety
took
from
the
english
in
the
sea
stretched
out
blue
and
lovely
under
the
fringe
of
sand
box
trees
and
almonds
which
grew
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
the
air
was
perfumed
by
white
acacia
flowers
sweeter
than
orange
blossom
captain
limped
down
with
me
into
the
gardens
for
a
fuller
look
at
the
scene
dusky
fishermen
were
busy
with
their
nets
catching
things
like
herrings
which
come
in
daily
to
the
shore
to
escape
the
monsters
which
prey
upon
them
canoes
on
the
old
carib
pattern
were
slipping
along
outside
trailing
lines
for
kingfish
and
bonitos
others
were
setting
baskets
like
enormous
lobster
pots
or
hoop
nets
such
as
we
use
to
catch
tench
in
english
ponds
these
too
a
legacy
from
the
caribs
made
of
strong
tough
cane
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
were
the
smart
american
schooners
which
i
had
seen
on
landing
shallow
low
in
the
water
with
heavy
spars
which
bring
yankee
to
the
islands
and
carry
back
to
new
york
bananas
and
limes
and
pineapples
there
they
were
models
of
tom
cringle
airy
as
english
yachts
and
equal
to
anything
from
a
smuggling
cruise
to
a
race
for
a
cup
i
could
have
gazed
for
ever
so
beautiful
so
new
so
like
a
dream
it
was
had
i
not
been
brought
back
swiftly
to
prose
and
reality
suddenly
out
of
a
clear
sky
without
notice
and
without
provocation
first
a
few
drops
of
rain
fell
and
then
a
deluge
which
set
the
gutters
running
we
had
to
scuttle
home
under
our
umbrellas
i
was
told
and
i
discovered
afterwards
by
fuller
experience
that
this
was
the
way
in
dominica
and
that
if
i
went
out
anywhere
i
must
be
prepared
for
it
in
our
retreat
we
encountered
a
abbé
with
a
collar
and
a
gold
cross
who
bowed
to
my
companion
i
would
gladly
have
been
introduced
to
him
but
neither
he
nor
we
had
leisure
for
courtesies
in
the
torrent
which
was
falling
upon
us
footnotes
not
to
be
confounded
with
domingo
which
is
called
after
domenic
where
the
spaniards
first
settled
and
is
now
divided
into
the
two
black
republics
of
domingo
and
hayti
dominica
lies
in
the
chain
of
the
antilles
between
martinique
and
guadaloupe
and
was
so
named
by
columbus
because
he
discovered
it
on

reflections
there
was
much
to
be
seen
in
dominica
of
the
sort
which
travellers
go
in
search
of
there
was
the
hot
sulphur
spring
in
the
mountains
there
was
the
hot
lake
there
was
another
volcanic
crater
a
hollow
in
the
centre
of
the
island
now
filled
with
water
and
surrounded
with
forest
there
were
the
caribs
some
thirty
families
of
them
living
among
thickets
through
which
paths
must
be
cut
before
we
could
reach
them
we
could
undertake
nothing
till
captain
could
ride
again
distant
expeditions
can
only
be
attempted
on
horses
they
are
bred
to
the
work
they
climb
like
cats
and
step
out
safely
where
a
fall
or
a
twisted
ankle
would
be
the
probable
consequence
of
attempting
to
go
on
foot
meanwhile
roseau
itself
was
to
be
seen
and
the
immediate
neighbourhood
and
this
i
could
manage
for
myself
my
first
night
was
disturbed
by
unfamiliar
noises
and
strange
imaginations
i
escaped
mosquitoes
through
the
care
of
the
black
fairies
but
mosquito
curtains
will
not
keep
out
sounds
and
when
the
fireflies
had
put
out
their
lights
there
began
the
singular
chorus
of
tropical
midnight
frogs
lizards
bats
croaked
sang
and
whistled
with
no
intermission
careless
whether
they
were
in
discord
or
harmony
the
palm
branches
outside
my
window
swayed
in
the
land
breeze
and
the
dry
branches
rustled
crisply
as
if
they
were
plates
of
silver
at
intervals
came
cataracts
of
rain
and
above
all
the
rest
the
deep
boom
of
the
cathedral
bell
tolling
out
the
hours
like
a
note
of
the
old
world
the
catholic
clergy
had
brought
the
bells
with
them
as
they
had
brought
their
faith
into
these
new
lands
it
was
pathetic
it
was
ominous
music
for
what
had
we
done
and
what
were
we
doing
to
set
beside
it
in
the
century
for
which
the
island
had
been
ours
towards
morning
i
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
of
the
convent
adjoining
the
garden
calling
the
nuns
to
matins
happily
in
the
tropics
hot
nights
do
not
imply
an
early
dawn
the
darkness
lingers
late
sleep
comes
at
last
and
drowns
our
fancies
in
forgetfulness
the
swimming
bath
was
immediately
under
my
room
i
ventured
into
it
with
some
trepidation
the
basement
story
in
most
west
indian
houses
is
open
to
allow
the
air
free
passage
under
them
the
space
thus
left
vacant
is
used
for
lumber
and
rubbish
and
if
scorpions
or
snakes
are
in
the
neighbourhood
is
the
place
where
one
would
look
for
them
there
the
bath
was
i
had
been
advised
to
be
careful
and
as
it
was
dark
this
was
not
easy
the
fear
however
was
worse
than
the
reality
awkward
encounters
do
happen
if
one
is
long
in
these
countries
but
they
are
rare
and
seldom
befall
the
accidental
visitor
and
the
plunge
into
fresh
water
is
so
delicious
that
one
is
willing
to
risk
the
chance
i
wandered
out
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
over
the
horizon
the
cool
of
the
morning
is
the
time
to
see
the
people
the
market
girls
were
streaming
into
the
town
with
their
baskets
of
vegetables
on
their
heads
the
fishing
boats
were
out
again
on
the
bay
our
anglican
church
had
its
bell
too
as
well
as
the
cathedral
the
door
was
open
and
i
went
in
and
found
a
clergyman
preparing
a
flock
of
seven
or
eight
blacks
and
mulattoes
for
the
communion
he
was
taking
them
through
their
catechism
explaining
very
properly
that
religion
meant
doing
duty
and
that
it
was
not
enough
to
profess
particular
opinions
dominica
being
roman
catholic
and
roman
catholics
not
generally
appreciating
or
understanding
the
claims
of
anglicans
to
the
possession
of
the
sacraments
he
pointed
out
where
the
difference
lay
he
insisted
that
we
had
priests
as
well
as
they
we
had
confession
we
had
absolution
only
our
priests
did
not
claim
as
the
catholics
did
a
direct
power
in
themselves
to
forgive
sins
their
office
was
to
tell
sinners
that
if
they
truly
and
sincerely
repented
and
amended
their
lives
god
would
forgive
them
what
he
said
was
absolutely
true
but
i
could
not
see
in
the
dim
faces
of
the
catechumens
that
the
distinction
was
particularly
intelligible
to
them
if
they
thought
at
all
they
probably
reflected
that
no
divinely
constituted
successor
of
the
apostles
was
needed
to
communicate
a
truism
which
every
sensible
person
was
equally
able
and
entitled
to
tell
them
still
the
good
earnest
man
meant
well
and
i
wished
him
more
success
in
his
missionary
enterprise
than
he
was
likely
to
find
from
the
church
of
england
to
the
great
rival
establishment
was
but
a
few
minutes
walk
the
cathedral
was
five
times
as
large
at
least
as
the
building
which
i
had
just
left
old
in
age
old
in
appearance
with
the
usual
indifferent
pictures
or
coloured
prints
with
the
usual
decorated
altar
but
otherwise
simple
and
venerable
there
was
no
service
going
on
for
it
was
a
a
few
old
men
and
women
only
were
silently
saying
their
prayers
on
sundays
i
was
told
that
it
was
overflowing
the
negro
morals
are
as
emancipated
in
dominica
as
in
the
rest
of
the
west
indies
obeah
is
not
forgotten
and
along
with
the
catholic
religion
goes
on
an
active
belief
in
magic
and
witchcraft
but
their
religion
is
not
necessarily
a
sham
to
them
it
was
the
same
in
europe
in
the
ages
of
faith
even
in
enlightened
protestant
countries
people
calling
themselves
christians
believe
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
can
be
called
up
to
amuse
an
evening
party
the
blacks
in
this
respect
are
no
worse
than
their
white
kinsmen
the
priests
have
a
genuine
human
hold
upon
them
they
baptize
the
children
they
commit
the
dead
to
the
cemetery
with
the
promise
of
immortality
they
are
personally
loved
and
respected
and
when
a
young
couple
marry
as
they
seldom
but
occasionally
do
it
is
to
the
priest
that
they
apply
to
tie
them
together
from
the
cathedral
i
wandered
through
the
streets
of
roseau
they
had
been
well
laid
out
the
streets
themselves
and
the
roads
leading
to
them
from
the
country
had
been
carefully
paved
and
spoke
of
a
time
when
the
town
had
been
full
of
life
and
vigour
but
the
grass
was
growing
between
the
stones
and
the
houses
generally
were
dilapidated
and
dirty
a
few
massive
stone
buildings
there
were
on
which
time
and
rain
had
made
no
impression
but
these
probably
were
all
french
built
long
ago
perhaps
in
the
days
of
labat
and
madame
ouvernard
the
english
hand
had
struck
the
island
with
paralysis
the
british
flag
was
flying
over
the
fort
but
for
once
i
had
no
pride
in
looking
at
it
the
fort
itself
was
falling
to
pieces
like
the
fort
at
grenada
the
stones
on
the
slope
on
which
it
stands
had
run
with
the
blood
which
we
spilt
in
the
winning
of
it
dominica
had
then
been
regarded
as
the
choicest
jewel
in
the
necklace
of
the
antilles
for
the
last
we
have
left
it
to
desolation
as
a
child
leaves
a
plaything
that
it
is
tired
of
in
roseau
as
in
most
other
towns
the
most
interesting
spot
is
the
market
there
you
see
the
produce
of
the
soil
there
you
see
the
people
that
produce
it
and
you
see
them
not
on
show
as
in
church
on
sundays
but
in
their
active
working
condition
the
market
place
at
roseau
is
a
large
square
court
close
to
the
sea
well
paved
surrounded
by
warehouses
and
luxuriantly
shaded
by
large
overhanging
trees
under
these
trees
were
hundreds
of
black
women
young
and
old
with
their
fish
and
fowls
and
fruit
and
bread
their
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
their
oranges
and
limes
and
plantains
they
had
walked
in
from
the
country
five
or
ten
miles
before
sunrise
with
their
loaded
baskets
on
their
heads
they
would
walk
back
at
night
with
flour
or
salt
fish
or
oil
or
whatever
they
happened
to
want
i
did
not
see
a
single
sullen
face
among
them
their
figures
were
unconscious
of
lacing
and
their
feet
of
the
monstrosities
which
we
call
shoes
they
moved
with
the
lightness
and
elasticity
of
leopards
i
thought
that
i
had
never
seen
in
any
drawing
room
in
london
so
many
perfectly
graceful
forms
they
could
not
mend
their
faces
but
even
in
some
of
these
there
was
a
swarthy
beauty
the
hair
was
hopeless
and
they
knew
it
but
they
turn
the
defect
into
an
ornament
by
the
coloured
handkerchief
which
they
twist
about
their
heads
leaving
the
ends
flowing
they
chattered
like
jackdaws
about
a
church
tower
two
or
three
of
the
best
looking
seeing
that
i
admired
them
a
little
used
their
eyes
and
made
some
laughing
remarks
they
spoke
in
their
french
clipping
off
the
first
and
last
syllables
of
the
words
i
but
half
understood
them
and
could
not
return
their
bits
of
wit
i
can
only
say
that
if
their
habits
were
as
loose
as
white
people
say
they
are
i
did
not
see
a
single
licentious
expression
either
in
face
or
manner
they
seemed
to
me
merry
innocent
young
women
as
free
from
any
thought
of
evil
as
the
peasant
girls
in
brittany
two
dames
were
in
a
state
of
violent
excitement
about
some
subject
on
which
they
differed
in
opinion
a
ring
gathered
about
them
and
they
declaimed
at
one
another
with
fiery
volubility
it
did
not
go
beyond
words
but
both
were
natural
orators
throwing
their
heads
back
waving
their
arms
limbs
and
chest
quivering
with
emotion
there
was
no
personal
abuse
or
disposition
to
claw
each
other
on
both
sides
it
was
a
rhetorical
outpouring
of
emotional
argument
one
of
them
a
tall
pure
blood
negress
black
as
if
she
had
just
landed
from
guinea
began
at
last
to
get
the
best
of
it
her
gesticulations
became
more
imposing
she
shook
her
finger
this
she
said
and
that
till
she
bore
her
antagonist
down
and
sent
her
flying
the
audience
then
melted
away
and
i
left
the
conqueror
standing
alone
shooting
a
last
volley
at
the
retreating
enemy
and
making
passionate
appeals
to
the
universe
the
subject
of
the
discussion
was
a
curious
one
it
was
on
the
merits
of
race
the
defeated
champion
had
a
taint
of
white
blood
in
her
the
black
woman
insisted
that
blacks
were
of
pure
breed
and
whites
were
of
pure
breed
mulattoes
were
mongrels
not
creatures
of
god
at
all
but
creatures
of
human
wickedness
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
mulatto
was
convinced
but
she
accepted
her
defeat
the
conqueror
it
was
quite
clear
was
satisfied
that
she
had
the
best
of
the
discussion
and
that
the
hearers
were
of
the
same
opinion
illustration
morning
walk
dominica
from
the
market
i
stepped
back
upon
the
quay
where
i
had
the
luck
to
witness
a
novel
form
of
fishing
the
most
singular
i
have
ever
fallen
in
with
i
have
mentioned
the
white
fish
which
come
in
upon
the
shores
of
the
island
they
travel
as
most
small
fish
do
in
enormous
shoals
and
keep
i
suppose
in
the
shallow
waters
to
avoid
the
kingfish
and
bonitos
who
are
good
judges
in
their
way
and
find
these
small
creatures
exceptionally
excellent
the
wooden
pier
ran
out
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
into
the
sea
it
was
a
platform
standing
on
piles
with
openings
in
several
places
from
which
stairs
led
down
to
landing
stages
the
depth
at
the
extremity
was
about
five
fathoms
there
is
little
or
no
tide
the
difference
between
high
water
and
low
being
not
more
than
a
couple
of
feet
looking
down
the
staircases
i
saw
among
the
piles
in
the
brilliantly
clear
water
unnumbered
thousands
of
the
fish
which
i
have
described
the
fishermen
had
carried
a
long
net
round
the
pier
from
shore
to
shore
completely
inclosing
it
the
fish
were
shut
in
and
had
no
means
of
escape
except
at
the
shore
end
where
boys
were
busy
driving
them
back
with
stones
but
how
the
net
was
to
be
drawn
among
the
piles
or
what
was
to
be
done
next
i
was
curious
to
learn
i
was
not
left
long
to
conjecture
a
circular
bag
net
was
produced
made
of
fine
strong
thread
coloured
a
light
green
and
almost
invisible
in
the
sea
when
it
was
spread
one
side
could
be
left
open
and
could
be
closed
at
will
by
a
running
line
from
above
this
net
was
let
carefully
down
between
the
piles
and
was
immediately
swollen
out
by
the
current
which
runs
along
the
coast
into
a
deep
bag
two
young
blacks
then
dived
one
saw
them
swimming
about
under
water
like
sharks
hunting
the
fish
before
them
as
a
dog
would
hunt
a
flock
of
sheep
their
companions
who
were
watching
from
the
platform
waited
till
they
saw
as
many
driven
into
the
purse
of
the
inner
net
as
they
could
trust
the
meshes
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
cord
was
then
drawn
the
net
was
closed
net
and
all
that
it
contained
were
hoisted
into
a
boat
carried
ashore
and
emptied
the
net
itself
was
then
brought
back
and
spread
again
for
a
fresh
haul
in
this
way
i
saw
as
many
fish
caught
as
would
have
filled
a
large
cart
the
contrivance
i
believe
is
one
more
inheritance
from
the
caribs
whom
labat
describes
as
doing
something
of
a
similar
kind
another
small
incident
happened
a
day
or
two
after
which
showed
the
capital
stuff
of
which
the
dominican
boatmen
and
fishermen
are
made
they
build
their
own
vessels
large
and
small
and
sail
them
themselves
not
afraid
of
the
wildest
weather
and
doing
the
local
trade
with
martinique
and
guadaloupe
four
of
these
smacks
cutter
rigged
from
ten
to
twenty
tons
burden
i
had
seen
lying
at
anchor
one
evening
with
an
american
schooner
under
the
gardens
in
the
night
the
wind
rose
into
one
of
those
short
violent
tropical
storms
which
if
they
lasted
longer
would
be
called
hurricanes
but
in
these
winter
months
are
soon
over
it
came
on
at
midnight
and
lasted
for
two
hours
the
noise
woke
me
for
the
house
shook
and
the
roar
was
like
niagara
it
was
too
dark
however
to
see
anything
the
tempest
died
away
at
last
and
i
slept
till
daybreak
my
first
thought
on
waking
was
for
the
smacks
and
the
schooner
had
they
sunk
at
their
moorings
had
they
broken
loose
or
what
had
become
of
them
i
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
cliff
to
see
the
damage
to
the
trees
had
been
less
than
i
expected
a
few
torn
branches
lay
on
the
lawn
and
the
leaves
were
cast
about
but
the
anchorage
was
empty
every
vessel
of
every
sort
and
size
was
gone
there
was
still
a
moderate
gale
blowing
as
the
wind
was
the
sea
was
tolerably
smooth
for
a
mile
or
two
but
outside
the
waves
were
breaking
violently
and
the
foam
scuds
were
whirling
off
their
crests
the
schooner
was
about
four
miles
off
beating
back
under
storm
canvas
making
good
weather
of
it
and
promising
in
a
tack
or
two
to
recover
the
moorings
the
smacks
being
less
powerful
vessels
had
been
driven
farther
out
to
sea
three
of
them
i
saw
labouring
heavily
in
the
offing
the
fourth
i
thought
at
first
had
disappeared
altogether
but
finally
i
made
out
a
white
speck
on
the
horizon
which
i
supposed
to
be
the
missing
cutter
one
of
the
first
three
presently
dropped
away
to
leeward
and
i
lost
sight
of
her
the
rest
made
their
way
back
in
good
time
towards
the
afternoon
when
the
wind
had
gone
down
the
two
that
remained
came
in
after
them
and
before
night
they
were
all
in
their
places
again
the
gale
had
struck
them
at
about
midnight
their
cables
had
parted
and
they
had
been
blown
away
to
sea
the
crews
of
the
schooner
and
of
three
of
the
cutters
were
all
on
board
they
got
their
vessels
under
command
and
had
been
in
no
serious
danger
in
the
fourth
there
was
no
one
but
a
small
black
boy
of
the
island
he
had
been
asleep
and
woke
to
find
himself
driving
before
the
wind
in
an
hour
or
two
he
would
have
been
beyond
the
shelter
of
the
land
and
in
the
high
seas
which
were
then
running
must
have
been
inevitably
swamped
the
little
fellow
contrived
in
the
darkness
no
one
could
tell
how
to
set
a
scrap
of
his
mainsail
get
his
staysail
up
and
in
this
condition
to
lie
head
to
the
wind
so
handled
small
cutters
if
they
have
a
deck
over
them
can
ride
out
an
ordinary
gale
in
tolerable
security
they
drift
of
course
in
a
hurricane
the
only
safety
is
in
yielding
to
it
but
they
make
fair
resistance
and
the
speed
is
checked
the
most
practical
seaman
could
have
done
no
better
than
this
boy
he
had
to
wait
for
help
in
the
morning
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
set
his
canvas
properly
and
work
his
boat
home
he
would
have
been
driven
out
at
last
and
as
he
had
neither
food
nor
water
would
have
been
starved
had
he
escaped
drowning
but
his
three
consorts
saw
him
they
knew
how
it
was
and
one
of
them
went
back
to
his
assistance
i
have
known
the
fishing
boys
of
the
english
channel
all
my
life
they
are
generally
skilful
ready
and
daring
beyond
their
years
but
i
never
knew
one
lad
not
more
than
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
who
if
woke
out
of
his
sleep
by
a
hurricane
in
a
dark
night
and
alone
would
have
understood
so
well
what
to
do
or
have
it
done
so
effectually
there
are
plenty
more
of
such
black
boys
in
dominica
and
they
deserve
a
better
fate
than
to
be
sent
drifting
before
constitutional
whirlwinds
back
into
barbarism
because
we
on
whom
their
fate
depends
are
too
ignorant
or
too
careless
to
provide
them
with
a
tolerable
government
the
kind
captain
churchill
finding
himself
tied
to
his
chair
and
wishing
to
give
me
every
assistance
towards
seeing
the
island
had
invited
a
creole
gentleman
from
the
other
side
of
it
to
stay
a
few
days
with
us
f
a
man
about
thirty
was
one
of
the
few
survivors
from
among
the
planters
he
had
never
been
out
of
the
west
indies
but
was
a
man
of
honesty
and
intelligence
could
use
his
eyes
and
form
sound
judgments
on
subjects
which
immediately
concerned
him
i
had
studied
roseau
for
myself
with
f
for
a
companion
i
made
acquaintance
with
the
environs
we
started
for
our
walks
at
daybreak
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
we
climbed
cliffs
we
rambled
on
the
rich
levels
about
the
river
once
amply
cultivated
and
even
now
the
soil
is
luxuriant
in
neglect
a
few
canefields
still
survive
but
most
of
them
are
turned
to
other
uses
and
you
pass
wherever
you
go
the
ruins
of
old
mills
the
massive
foundations
of
ancient
warehouses
huge
hewn
stones
built
and
mortared
well
together
telling
what
once
had
been
the
mango
trees
which
the
owners
had
planted
waving
green
over
the
wrecks
of
their
forgotten
industry
such
industry
as
is
now
to
be
found
is
as
elsewhere
in
general
the
industry
of
the
black
peasantry
it
is
the
same
as
in
grenada
the
whites
or
the
english
part
of
them
have
lost
heart
and
cease
to
struggle
against
the
stream
a
state
of
things
more
helplessly
provoking
was
never
seen
skill
and
capital
and
labour
have
only
to
be
brought
to
bear
together
and
the
land
might
be
a
garden
of
eden
all
precious
fruits
and
precious
spices
and
gums
and
plants
of
rarest
medicinal
virtues
will
spring
and
grow
and
flourish
for
the
asking
the
limes
are
as
large
as
lemons
and
in
the
markets
of
the
united
states
are
considered
the
best
in
the
world
as
to
natural
beauty
the
west
indian
islands
are
like
scott
novels
where
we
admire
most
the
one
which
we
have
read
the
last
but
dominica
bears
the
palm
away
from
all
of
them
one
morning
f
took
me
a
walk
up
the
roseau
river
an
ample
stream
even
in
what
is
called
the
dry
season
with
deep
pools
full
of
eels
and
mullet
we
entered
among
the
hills
which
were
rising
steep
above
us
the
valley
grew
deeper
or
rather
there
were
a
series
of
valleys
gorges
dense
with
forest
which
had
been
torn
out
by
the
cataracts
the
path
was
like
the
mule
tracts
of
the
alps
cut
in
other
days
along
the
sides
of
the
precipices
with
remnants
of
old
conduits
which
supplied
water
to
the
mills
below
rich
odorous
acacias
bent
over
us
the
flowers
the
trees
the
birds
the
insects
were
a
maze
of
perfume
and
loveliness
occasionally
some
valley
opposite
the
sun
would
be
spanned
by
a
rainbow
as
the
rays
shone
through
a
morning
shower
out
of
the
blue
sky
we
wandered
on
and
on
wading
through
tributary
brooks
stopping
every
minute
to
examine
some
new
fern
or
plant
peasant
women
and
children
meeting
us
at
intervals
on
their
way
into
the
town
there
were
trees
to
take
shelter
under
when
indispensable
which
even
the
rain
of
dominica
could
not
penetrate
the
levels
at
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
and
the
lower
slopes
where
the
soil
was
favourable
were
carelessly
planted
with
limes
which
were
in
full
bearing
small
black
boys
and
girls
went
about
under
the
trees
gathering
the
large
fruit
which
lay
on
the
ground
thick
as
apples
in
a
west
of
england
orchard
here
was
all
this
profusion
of
nature
lavish
beyond
example
and
the
enterprising
youth
of
england
were
neglecting
a
colony
which
might
yield
them
wealth
beyond
the
treasures
of
the
old
sugar
planters
going
to
florida
to
texas
to
south
america
taking
their
energy
and
their
capital
to
the
land
of
the
foreigner
leaving
dominica
which
might
be
the
garden
of
the
world
a
precious
emerald
set
in
the
ring
of
their
own
antilles
enriched
by
the
sacred
memories
of
glorious
english
achievements
as
if
such
a
place
had
no
existence
dominica
would
surrender
herself
with
a
light
heart
to
france
to
america
to
any
country
which
would
accept
the
charge
of
her
destinies
why
should
she
care
any
more
for
england
which
has
so
little
care
for
her
beauties
conscious
of
their
charms
do
not
like
to
be
so
thrown
aside
there
is
no
dislike
to
us
among
the
blacks
they
are
indifferent
but
even
their
indifference
would
be
changed
into
loyalty
if
we
made
the
slightest
effort
to
recover
it
the
poor
black
was
a
faithful
servant
as
long
as
he
was
a
slave
as
a
freeman
he
is
conscious
of
his
inferiority
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
would
attach
himself
to
a
rational
white
employer
with
at
least
as
much
fidelity
as
a
spaniel
like
the
spaniel
too
if
he
is
denied
the
chance
of
developing
under
guidance
the
better
qualities
which
are
in
him
he
will
drift
back
into
a
mangy
cur
in
no
country
ought
a
government
to
exist
for
which
respect
is
impossible
and
english
rule
as
it
exists
in
dominica
is
a
subject
for
a
comedy
the
of
the
leeward
islands
resides
in
antigua
and
in
theory
ought
to
go
on
progress
and
visit
in
turn
his
subordinate
dominions
his
visits
are
rare
as
those
of
angels
the
eminent
person
who
at
present
holds
that
high
office
has
been
once
in
nevis
and
thrice
in
dominica
but
only
for
the
briefest
stay
there
perhaps
he
has
held
aloof
in
consequence
of
an
adventure
which
befell
a
visiting
governor
some
time
ago
on
one
of
these
occasions
when
there
is
a
constitution
there
is
an
opposition
if
there
are
no
grievances
the
opposition
manufacture
them
and
the
inhabitants
of
roseau
were
persuaded
that
they
were
an
oppressed
people
and
required
fuller
liberties
i
was
informed
that
his
excellency
had
no
sooner
landed
and
taken
possession
of
the
government
house
than
a
mob
of
men
and
women
gathered
in
the
market
place
under
the
leadership
of
their
elected
representative
the
girls
that
i
had
admired
very
likely
made
a
part
of
it
they
swarmed
up
into
the
gardens
they
demonstrated
under
the
windows
laughing
shouting
and
petitioning
his
excellency
first
barricaded
the
doors
then
opened
them
and
tried
a
speech
telling
the
dear
creatures
how
much
he
loved
and
respected
them
probably
they
did
not
understand
him
as
few
of
them
speak
english
producing
no
effect
he
retreated
again
barred
the
door
once
more
slipped
out
at
a
back
entrance
down
a
lane
to
the
port
took
refuge
on
board
his
steamer
and
disappeared
so
the
story
was
told
me
not
by
the
administrator
who
was
not
a
man
to
turn
english
authority
into
ridicule
but
by
some
one
on
the
spot
who
repeated
the
current
report
of
the
adventure
it
may
be
exaggerated
in
some
features
but
it
represents
at
any
rate
the
feeling
of
the
place
towards
the
head
representative
of
the
existing
government
i
will
mention
another
incident
said
to
have
occurred
still
more
recently
to
one
of
these
great
persons
very
like
what
befell
sancho
panza
in
barataria
this
too
may
have
been
wickedly
turned
but
it
was
the
subject
of
general
talk
and
general
amusement
on
board
the
steamers
which
make
the
round
of
the
antilles
universal
belief
is
a
fact
of
its
kind
and
though
it
tends
to
shape
itself
in
dramatic
form
more
completely
than
the
facts
justify
there
is
usually
some
truth
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
telegrams
to
the
west
indies
pass
through
new
york
and
often
pick
up
something
on
the
way
a
warning
message
reached
a
certain
colony
that
a
schooner
with
a
fenian
crew
was
coming
down
to
annex
the
island
or
at
least
to
kidnap
the
governor
this
distinguished
gentleman
ought
perhaps
to
have
suspected
that
a
joke
was
being
played
upon
his
fears
but
he
was
a
landlord
a
had
been
threatened
seriously
in
canada
why
not
he
in
the
antilles
he
was
as
much
agitated
as
sancho
himself
all
these
islands
were
and
are
entirely
undefended
save
by
a
police
which
can
not
be
depended
on
to
resist
a
serious
invasion
they
were
called
out
rumour
said
that
in
half
the
rifles
the
cartridges
were
found
afterwards
inverted
the
next
day
dispelled
the
alarm
the
schooner
was
the
creation
of
some
irish
telegraph
clerk
and
the
scare
ended
in
laughter
but
under
the
jest
lies
the
wretched
certainty
that
the
antilles
have
no
protection
except
in
their
own
population
and
so
little
to
thank
england
for
that
scarcely
one
of
the
inhabitants
except
the
officials
would
lift
a
finger
to
save
the
connection
once
more
i
tell
these
stories
not
as
if
they
were
authenticated
facts
but
as
evidence
of
the
scornful
feeling
towards
english
authority
the
current
belief
in
them
is
a
fact
of
a
kind
and
a
very
serious
one
the
confederation
of
the
leeward
islands
may
have
been
a
convenience
to
the
colonial
office
and
may
have
allowed
a
slight
diminution
in
the
cost
of
administration
the
whole
west
indies
might
be
placed
under
a
single
governor
with
only
good
results
if
he
were
a
real
one
like
the
at
calcutta
but
each
single
island
has
lost
from
the
change
so
far
more
than
it
has
gained
each
ship
of
war
has
a
captain
of
its
own
and
officers
of
its
own
trained
specially
for
the
service
if
the
antilles
are
ever
to
thrive
each
of
them
also
should
have
some
trained
and
skilful
man
at
its
head
unembarrassed
by
local
elected
assemblies
the
whites
have
become
so
weak
that
they
would
welcome
the
abolition
of
such
assemblies
the
blacks
do
not
care
for
politics
and
would
be
pleased
to
see
them
swept
away
if
they
were
governed
wisely
and
fairly
of
course
in
that
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
appoint
governors
who
would
command
confidence
and
respect
but
let
governors
be
sent
who
would
be
governors
indeed
like
those
who
administer
the
indian
presidencies
and
the
white
residents
would
gather
heart
again
and
english
and
american
capitalists
would
bring
their
money
and
their
enterprise
and
the
blacks
would
grow
upwards
instead
of
downwards
let
us
persist
in
the
other
line
let
us
use
the
west
indian
governments
as
asylums
for
average
worthy
persons
who
have
to
be
provided
for
and
force
on
them
black
parliamentary
institutions
as
a
remedy
for
such
persons
inefficiency
and
these
beautiful
countries
will
become
like
hayti
with
obeah
triumphant
and
children
offered
to
the
devil
and
salted
and
eaten
till
the
conscience
of
mankind
wakes
again
and
the
americans
sweep
them
all
away
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
what
can
really
be
done
in
dominica
by
an
english
gentleman
who
has
gone
the
right
way
to
work
there
nicholls
came
out
a
few
years
ago
to
roseau
as
a
medical
officer
he
was
described
to
me
as
a
man
not
only
of
high
professional
skill
but
with
considerable
scientific
attainments
either
by
purchase
or
legacy
i
think
the
latter
he
had
become
possessed
of
a
small
estate
on
a
hillside
a
mile
or
two
from
the
town
he
had
built
a
house
upon
it
he
was
cultivating
the
soil
on
scientific
principles
and
had
politely
sent
me
an
invitation
to
call
on
him
and
see
what
he
was
about
i
was
delighted
to
avail
myself
of
such
an
opportunity
i
do
not
know
the
exact
extent
of
the
property
which
was
under
cultivation
perhaps
it
was
or
thirty
acres
the
chief
part
of
it
was
planted
with
lime
trees
the
limes
which
i
saw
growing
being
as
large
as
lemons
most
of
the
rest
was
covered
with
liberian
coffee
which
does
not
object
to
the
moist
climate
and
was
growing
with
profuse
luxuriance
each
tree
each
plant
had
been
personally
attended
to
pruned
when
it
needed
pruning
supported
by
bamboos
if
it
was
overgrowing
its
strength
while
the
ground
about
the
house
was
consecrated
to
botanical
experiments
and
specimens
were
to
be
seen
there
of
every
tropical
flower
shrub
or
tree
which
was
either
remarkable
for
its
beauty
or
valuable
for
its
chemical
properties
his
limes
and
coffee
went
principally
to
new
york
where
they
had
won
a
reputation
and
were
in
special
demand
but
ingenuity
tries
other
tracks
besides
the
beaten
one
nicholls
had
a
manufactory
of
citric
acid
which
had
been
found
equally
excellent
in
europe
everything
which
he
produced
was
turning
to
gold
except
donkeys
seven
or
eight
of
which
were
feeding
under
his
windows
and
which
multiplied
so
fast
that
he
could
not
tell
what
to
do
with
them
industries
so
various
and
so
active
required
labour
and
i
saw
many
of
the
blacks
at
work
on
the
grounds
in
apparent
contradiction
to
the
general
west
indian
experience
he
told
me
that
he
had
never
found
a
difficulty
about
it
he
paid
them
fair
wages
and
paid
them
regularly
without
the
overseer
fines
and
drawbacks
he
knew
one
from
the
other
personally
could
call
each
by
his
name
remembered
where
he
came
from
where
he
lived
and
how
and
could
joke
with
him
about
his
wife
or
mistress
they
in
consequence
clung
to
him
with
an
innocent
affection
stayed
with
him
all
the
week
without
asking
for
holidays
and
worked
with
interest
and
goodwill
four
years
only
had
elapsed
since
nicholls
commenced
his
undertakings
and
he
already
saw
his
way
to
clearing
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
on
that
one
small
patch
of
acres
i
may
mention
that
being
the
only
man
in
the
island
of
really
superior
attainments
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
win
one
of
the
seats
in
the
elective
part
of
the
legislature
there
was
nothing
particularly
favourable
in
the
situation
of
his
land
all
parts
of
dominica
would
respond
as
willingly
to
similar
treatment
what
could
be
the
reason
nicholls
asked
me
why
young
englishmen
went
planting
to
so
many
other
countries
went
even
to
ceylon
and
borneo
while
comparatively
at
their
own
doors
within
a
sail
of
plymouth
there
was
this
island
immeasurably
more
fertile
than
either
the
explanation
i
suppose
is
the
misgiving
that
the
west
indies
are
consigned
by
the
tendencies
of
english
policy
to
the
black
population
and
that
a
local
government
created
by
representatives
of
the
negro
vote
would
make
a
residence
there
for
an
energetic
and
european
less
tolerable
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
globe
the
republic
of
hayti
not
only
excludes
a
white
man
from
any
share
of
the
administration
but
forbids
his
acquisition
or
possession
of
real
property
in
any
form
far
short
of
such
extreme
provisions
the
most
prosperous
industry
might
be
blighted
by
taxation
is
a
beautiful
subject
for
oratorical
declamation
if
the
fact
corresponded
to
the
theory
and
if
the
possession
of
a
vote
produced
the
elevating
effects
upon
the
character
which
are
so
noisily
insisted
upon
it
would
be
the
welcome
panacea
for
political
and
social
disorder
unfortunately
the
fact
does
not
correspond
to
the
theory
the
possession
of
a
vote
never
improved
the
character
of
any
human
being
and
never
will
there
are
many
islands
in
the
west
indies
and
an
experiment
might
be
ventured
without
any
serious
risk
let
the
suffrage
principle
be
applied
in
its
fullness
where
the
condition
of
the
people
seems
best
to
promise
success
in
some
one
of
them
dominica
would
do
as
well
as
any
other
let
a
man
of
ability
and
character
with
an
ambition
to
distinguish
himself
be
sent
to
govern
with
a
free
hand
let
him
choose
his
own
advisers
let
him
be
untrammelled
unless
he
falls
into
fatal
and
inexcusable
errors
with
interference
from
home
let
him
have
time
to
carry
out
any
plans
which
he
may
form
without
fear
of
recall
at
the
end
of
the
normal
period
after
ten
or
fifteen
years
let
the
results
of
the
two
systems
be
compared
side
by
side
i
imagine
the
objection
to
such
a
trial
would
be
the
same
which
was
once
made
in
my
hearing
by
an
irish
friend
of
mine
who
was
urging
on
an
english
statesman
the
conversion
of
ireland
into
a
crown
colony
dare
not
try
it
he
said
if
you
did
in
twenty
years
we
would
be
the
most
prosperous
island
of
the
two
and
you
would
be
wanting
to
follow
our
example
we
had
exhausted
the
neighbourhood
of
roseau
after
a
few
days
captain
was
again
able
to
ride
and
we
could
undertake
more
extended
expeditions
he
provided
me
with
a
horse
or
pony
or
something
between
both
a
creature
that
would
climb
a
stone
staircase
at
an
angle
of
or
slide
down
a
clay
slope
soaked
by
a
tropical
shower
with
the
same
indifference
with
which
it
would
canter
along
a
meadow
in
the
slave
times
cultivation
had
been
carried
up
into
the
mountains
there
were
the
old
tracks
through
the
forest
engineered
along
the
edges
of
precipices
torrents
roaring
far
down
below
and
tall
green
trees
standing
in
hollows
underneath
whose
top
branches
were
on
a
level
with
our
eyes
we
had
to
ride
with
mackintosh
and
umbrella
prepared
at
any
moment
to
have
the
floods
descend
upon
us
the
best
costume
would
be
none
at
all
while
the
sun
is
above
the
horizon
the
island
seems
to
lie
under
the
arches
of
perpetual
rainbows
one
gets
wet
and
one
dries
again
and
one
is
none
the
worse
for
the
adventure
i
had
heard
that
it
was
dangerous
it
did
no
harm
to
me
a
very
particular
object
was
to
reach
the
crest
of
the
mountain
ridge
which
divides
dominica
down
the
middle
we
saw
the
peaks
high
above
us
but
it
was
useless
to
try
the
ascent
if
one
could
see
nothing
when
one
arrived
and
mists
and
clouds
hung
about
so
persistently
that
we
had
to
put
off
our
expedition
day
after
day
a
tolerable
morning
came
at
last
we
started
early
a
faithful
black
youth
ran
alongside
of
the
horses
to
pick
us
up
if
we
fell
and
to
carry
the
indispensable
luncheon
basket
we
rode
through
the
town
over
the
bridge
and
by
the
foot
of
nicholls
plantations
we
passed
through
lime
and
banana
gardens
rising
slowly
along
the
side
of
a
glen
above
the
river
the
road
had
been
made
by
the
french
long
ago
and
went
right
across
the
island
it
had
once
been
carefully
paved
but
wet
and
neglect
had
loosened
the
stones
and
tumbled
them
out
of
their
places
trees
had
driven
their
roots
through
the
middle
of
the
track
mountain
streams
had
taken
advantage
of
convenient
cuttings
and
scooped
them
into
waterways
the
road
commissioner
on
the
official
staff
seemed
a
merely
ornamental
functionary
we
could
only
travel
at
a
foot
pace
and
in
single
file
happily
our
horses
were
used
to
it
along
this
road
in
sir
george
prevost
retreated
with
the
english
garrison
of
roseau
when
attacked
in
force
from
martinique
saved
his
men
and
saved
the
other
part
of
the
island
till
relief
came
and
the
invaders
were
driven
out
again
that
was
the
last
of
the
fighting
and
we
have
been
left
since
in
undisturbed
possession
dominica
was
then
sacred
as
the
scene
of
rodney
glories
now
i
suppose
if
the
french
came
again
we
should
calculate
the
mercantile
value
of
the
place
to
us
and
having
found
it
to
be
nothing
at
all
might
conclude
that
it
would
be
better
to
let
them
keep
it
we
went
up
and
up
winding
round
projecting
spurs
of
mountain
here
and
there
coming
on
plateaus
where
pioneering
blacks
were
clearing
patches
of
forest
for
their
yams
and
coffee
we
skirted
the
edge
of
a
valley
several
miles
across
on
the
far
side
of
which
we
saw
the
steaming
of
the
sulphur
springs
and
beyond
and
above
it
a
mountain
peak
four
thousand
feet
high
and
clothed
with
timber
to
the
summit
in
most
countries
the
vegetation
grows
thin
as
you
rise
into
the
higher
altitudes
here
the
bush
only
seems
to
grow
denser
the
trees
grander
and
more
the
orchids
and
parasites
on
the
boughs
more
variously
brilliant
there
were
tree
ferns
less
splendid
than
those
in
new
zealand
and
australia
but
larger
than
any
one
can
see
in
english
wild
oranges
bending
under
the
weight
of
ripe
fruit
which
was
glowing
on
their
branches
wild
pines
wild
begonias
scattered
along
the
banks
and
a
singularly
brilliant
plant
which
they
call
the
wild
plantain
but
it
is
not
a
plantain
at
all
with
large
broad
pointed
leaves
radiating
out
from
a
centre
like
an
aloe
and
a
crimson
flower
stem
rising
up
straight
in
the
middle
it
was
startling
to
see
such
insolent
beauty
displaying
itself
indifferently
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
with
no
human
eye
to
look
at
it
unless
of
some
passing
black
or
wandering
carib
the
track
had
been
carried
across
hot
streams
fresh
from
boiling
springs
and
along
the
edge
of
chasms
where
there
was
scarcely
foothold
for
the
horses
at
length
we
found
ourselves
on
what
was
apparently
the
highest
point
of
the
pass
we
could
not
see
where
we
were
for
the
trees
and
bushes
which
surrounded
us
but
the
path
began
to
descend
on
the
other
side
near
the
summit
was
a
lake
formed
in
an
old
volcanic
crater
which
we
had
come
specially
to
look
at
we
descended
a
few
hundred
feet
into
a
hollow
among
the
hills
where
the
lake
was
said
to
be
where
was
it
then
i
asked
the
guide
for
i
could
discover
nothing
that
suggested
a
lake
or
anything
like
one
he
pointed
into
the
bush
where
it
was
thicker
with
tropical
undergrowth
than
a
wheatfield
with
ears
of
corn
if
i
cared
to
creep
below
the
branches
for
two
hundred
yards
at
the
risk
of
meeting
snakes
scorpions
and
other
such
charming
creatures
i
should
find
myself
on
the
water
edge
to
ride
up
a
mountain
three
thousand
feet
high
to
be
near
a
wonder
which
i
could
not
see
after
all
was
not
what
i
had
proposed
to
myself
there
was
a
traveller
rest
at
the
point
where
we
halted
a
cool
damp
grotto
carved
into
the
we
picketed
our
horses
cutting
leafy
boughs
off
the
trees
for
them
and
making
cushions
for
ourselves
out
of
the
ferns
we
were
told
that
if
we
walked
on
for
half
a
mile
we
should
see
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
if
we
were
lucky
we
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lake
meanwhile
clouds
rolled
down
off
the
mountains
filled
the
hollow
where
we
stood
and
so
wrapped
us
in
mist
that
the
question
seemed
rather
how
we
were
to
return
than
whether
we
should
venture
farther
while
we
were
considering
what
to
do
we
heard
steps
approaching
through
the
fog
and
a
party
of
blacks
came
up
on
their
way
to
roseau
with
a
sick
companion
whom
they
were
carrying
in
a
palanquin
we
were
eating
our
luncheon
in
the
grotto
and
they
stopped
to
talk
to
our
guide
and
stare
at
us
two
of
them
a
lad
and
a
girl
came
up
closer
to
me
than
good
manners
would
have
allowed
if
they
had
possessed
such
things
the
am
as
good
as
you
and
you
will
be
good
enough
to
know
it
sort
of
tone
which
belongs
to
these
democratic
days
showing
itself
rather
notably
in
the
rising
generation
in
parts
of
these
islands
i
defended
myself
with
producing
a
sketch
book
and
proceeding
to
take
their
likenesses
on
which
they
fled
precipitately
our
sandwiches
finished
we
were
pensively
consuming
our
cigars
i
speculating
on
sir
george
prevost
and
his
party
of
redcoats
who
must
have
bivouacked
on
that
very
spot
when
the
clouds
broke
and
the
sun
came
out
the
interval
was
likely
to
be
a
short
one
so
we
hurried
to
our
feet
walked
rapidly
on
and
at
a
turn
of
the
path
where
a
hurricane
had
torn
a
passage
through
the
trees
we
caught
a
sight
of
our
lake
as
we
had
been
told
that
perhaps
we
might
do
it
lay
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
beneath
us
deep
and
still
winding
away
round
a
promontory
under
the
crags
and
woods
of
the
opposite
hills
they
call
it
a
crater
and
i
suppose
it
may
have
been
one
for
the
whole
island
shows
traces
of
violent
volcanic
disturbance
but
in
general
a
crater
is
a
bowl
and
this
was
like
a
reach
of
a
river
which
lost
itself
before
one
could
see
where
it
ended
they
told
us
that
in
old
times
when
troops
were
in
the
fort
and
the
white
men
of
the
island
went
about
and
enjoyed
themselves
there
were
boats
on
this
lake
and
parties
came
up
and
fished
there
now
it
was
like
the
pool
in
the
gardens
of
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
princess
guarded
by
impenetrable
thickets
and
whether
there
are
fish
there
or
enchanted
princesses
or
the
huts
of
some
tribe
of
caribs
hiding
in
those
fastnesses
from
negroes
whom
they
hate
or
from
white
men
whom
they
do
not
love
no
one
knows
or
cares
to
know
i
made
a
hurried
pencil
sketch
and
we
went
on
a
little
farther
and
we
were
out
of
the
bush
at
a
rocky
terrace
on
the
rim
of
the
great
valley
which
carries
the
rainfall
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
mountains
down
into
the
atlantic
we
were
feet
above
the
sea
far
away
the
ocean
stretched
out
before
us
the
horizon
line
where
sky
met
water
so
far
distant
that
both
had
melted
into
mist
at
the
point
where
they
touched
mount
diablot
where
labat
spent
a
night
catching
the
devil
birds
soared
up
on
our
left
hand
below
above
around
us
it
was
forest
everywhere
forest
and
only
forest
a
land
fertile
as
paradise
still
waiting
for
the
day
when
barren
woman
shall
bear
children
of
course
it
was
beautiful
if
that
be
of
any
consequence
mountain
peaks
and
crags
and
falling
waters
and
the
dark
green
of
the
trees
in
the
foreground
dissolving
from
tint
to
tint
to
grey
violet
and
blue
in
the
distance
even
at
the
height
where
we
stood
the
temperature
must
have
been
but
the
steaming
damp
of
the
woods
was
gone
the
air
was
clear
and
exhilarating
as
champagne
what
a
land
and
what
were
we
doing
with
it
this
fair
inheritance
won
by
english
hearts
and
hands
for
the
use
of
the
working
men
of
england
and
the
english
working
men
lying
squalid
in
the
grimy
alleys
of
crowded
towns
and
the
inheritance
turned
into
a
wilderness
visions
began
to
rise
of
what
might
be
but
visions
which
were
taken
from
me
before
they
could
shape
themselves
the
curtain
of
vapour
fell
down
over
us
again
and
all
was
gone
and
of
that
glorious
picture
nothing
was
left
but
our
own
two
selves
and
the
few
yards
of
red
rock
and
soil
on
which
we
were
standing
there
was
no
need
for
haste
now
we
return
slowly
to
our
horses
and
our
horses
carried
us
home
by
the
way
that
we
had
come
captain
went
carelessly
in
front
through
the
fog
over
boulders
and
watercourses
and
roots
of
fallen
trees
i
followed
as
i
could
expecting
every
moment
to
find
myself
flying
over
my
horse
head
stumbling
plunging
sliding
but
getting
through
with
it
somehow
the
creature
had
never
seen
me
before
but
was
as
careful
of
my
safety
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
acquaintance
and
friend
only
one
misadventure
befell
me
if
misadventure
it
may
be
called
shaken
and
damp
with
heat
i
was
riding
under
a
wild
orange
tree
the
fruit
within
reach
of
my
hand
i
picked
an
orange
and
plunged
my
teeth
into
the
skin
and
i
had
to
remember
my
rashness
for
days
the
oil
in
the
rind
pungent
as
aromatic
salts
rushed
on
my
palate
and
spurted
on
my
face
and
eyes
the
smart
for
the
moment
half
blinded
me
i
bethought
me
however
that
oranges
with
such
a
flavour
would
be
worth
something
and
a
box
of
them
which
was
sent
home
for
me
was
converted
into
marmalade
with
a
finer
flavour
than
ever
came
from
seville
what
more
can
i
say
of
dominica
i
stayed
with
the
hospitable
for
a
fortnight
at
the
appointed
time
the
returning
steamer
called
for
me
i
left
capt
with
a
warm
hope
that
he
might
not
be
consigned
for
ever
to
a
post
which
an
english
gentleman
ought
not
to
be
condemned
to
occupy
that
if
matters
could
not
be
mended
for
him
where
he
stood
he
might
find
a
situation
where
his
courage
and
his
understanding
might
be
turned
to
useful
purpose
i
can
never
forget
the
kindness
both
of
himself
and
his
clever
good
graceful
lady
i
can
not
forget
either
the
two
dusky
damsels
who
waited
upon
me
like
spirits
in
a
fairy
tale
it
was
night
when
i
left
the
packet
came
alongside
the
wharf
we
took
leave
by
the
gleaming
of
her
lights
the
whistle
screamed
and
dominica
and
all
that
i
had
seen
faded
into
a
memory
all
that
i
had
seen
but
not
all
that
i
had
thought
that
island
was
the
scene
of
the
most
glorious
of
england
many
famous
actions
it
had
been
won
for
us
again
and
again
by
the
gallantry
of
our
seamen
and
soldiers
it
had
been
secured
at
last
to
the
crown
by
the
genius
of
the
greatest
of
our
admirals
it
was
once
prosperous
it
might
be
prosperous
again
for
the
resources
of
the
soil
are
untouched
and
inexhaustible
the
black
population
are
exceptionally
worthy
they
are
excellent
boatmen
excellent
fishermen
excellent
mechanics
ready
to
undertake
any
work
if
treated
with
courtesy
and
kindness
yet
in
our
hands
it
is
falling
into
ruin
the
influence
of
england
there
is
gone
it
is
nothing
indifference
has
bred
indifference
in
turn
as
a
necessary
consequence
something
must
be
wrong
when
among
of
our
not
one
could
be
found
to
lift
a
hand
for
us
if
the
island
were
invaded
when
a
boat
crew
from
martinique
might
take
possession
of
it
without
a
show
of
resistance
if
i
am
asked
the
question
what
use
is
dominica
to
us
i
decline
to
measure
it
by
present
or
possible
marketable
value
i
answer
simply
that
it
is
part
of
the
dominions
of
the
queen
if
we
pinch
a
finger
the
smart
is
felt
in
the
brain
if
we
neglect
a
wound
in
the
least
important
part
of
our
persons
it
may
poison
the
system
unless
the
blood
of
an
organised
body
circulates
freely
through
the
extremities
the
extremities
mortify
and
drop
off
and
the
dropping
off
of
any
colony
of
ours
will
not
be
to
our
honour
and
may
be
to
our
shame
dominica
seems
but
a
small
thing
but
our
larger
colonies
are
observing
us
and
the
world
is
observing
us
and
what
we
do
or
fail
to
do
works
beyond
the
limits
of
its
immediate
operation
the
mode
of
management
which
produces
the
state
of
things
which
i
have
described
can
not
possibly
be
a
right
one
we
have
thought
it
wise
with
a
perfectly
honest
intention
to
leave
our
dependencies
generally
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
we
have
excepted
india
for
with
india
we
dare
not
run
the
risk
but
we
have
refused
to
consider
that
others
among
our
possessions
may
be
in
a
condition
analogous
to
india
and
we
have
allowed
them
to
drift
on
as
they
could
it
was
certainly
excusable
and
it
may
have
been
prudent
to
try
popular
methods
first
but
we
have
no
right
to
persist
in
the
face
of
a
failure
so
complete
we
are
obliged
to
keep
these
islands
for
it
seems
that
no
one
will
relieve
us
of
them
and
if
they
are
to
remain
ours
we
are
bound
so
to
govern
them
that
our
name
shall
be
respected
and
our
sovereignty
shall
not
be
a
mockery
am
i
asked
what
shall
be
done
i
have
answered
already
among
the
silent
thousands
whose
quiet
work
keeps
the
empire
alive
find
a
rajah
brooke
if
you
can
or
a
smith
of
scilly
if
none
of
these
are
attainable
even
a
sancho
panza
would
do
send
him
out
with
no
more
instructions
than
the
knight
of
la
mancha
gave
sancho
to
fear
god
and
do
his
duty
put
him
on
his
mettle
promise
him
the
respect
and
praise
of
all
good
men
if
he
does
well
and
if
he
calls
to
his
help
intelligent
persons
who
understand
the
cultivation
of
soils
and
the
management
of
men
in
half
a
score
of
years
dominica
would
be
the
brightest
gem
of
the
antilles
from
america
from
england
from
all
parts
of
the
world
admiring
tourists
would
be
flocking
there
to
see
what
government
could
do
and
curious
politicians
with
jealous
eyes
admitting
reluctantly
unwelcome
conclusions
woman
no
mortal
the
widespread
earth
can
find
a
fault
in
thee
thy
good
report
doth
reach
the
widespread
heaven
as
of
some
prince
who
in
the
likeness
of
a
god
doth
rule
subjects
stout
of
heart
and
strong
of
hand
and
men
speak
greatly
of
him
and
his
land
bears
wheat
and
rye
his
orchards
bend
with
fruit
his
flocks
breed
surely
the
sea
yields
her
fish
because
he
guides
his
folk
with
wisdom
in
grace
and
manly
virtue
because
guides
with
wisdom
that
is
the
whole
secret
the
leading
of
the
wise
few
the
willing
obedience
of
the
many
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
right
action
secure
this
and
you
secure
everything
fail
to
secure
it
and
be
your
liberties
as
wide
as
you
can
make
them
no
success
is
possible

the
dollar
or
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
which
lesseps
is
furnishing
the
vessel
which
called
for
us
at
dominica
was
crowded
with
them
and
we
picked
up
more
as
we
went
on
their
average
stay
is
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
a
year
half
of
them
have
gone
to
the
other
world
half
go
home
made
easy
for
life
with
money
enough
to
buy
a
few
acres
of
land
and
happy
ever
after
heedless
as
they
plunge
into
the
enterprise
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
harvest
of
dollars
they
might
earn
as
much
or
more
at
their
own
doors
if
there
were
any
one
to
employ
them
but
quiet
industry
is
out
of
joint
and
darien
has
seized
their
imaginations
as
an
eldorado
if
half
the
reports
which
reached
me
are
correct
in
all
the
world
there
is
not
perhaps
now
concentrated
in
any
single
spot
so
much
foul
disease
such
a
hideous
dungheap
of
moral
and
physical
abomination
as
in
the
scene
of
this
undertaking
of
engineering
by
the
scheme
as
it
was
first
propounded
millions
of
english
money
were
to
unite
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
to
form
a
highway
for
the
commerce
of
the
globe
and
enrich
with
untold
wealth
the
happy
owners
of
original
shares
the
thrifty
french
peasantry
were
tempted
by
the
golden
bait
and
poured
their
savings
into
lottery
box
all
that
money
and
more
besides
i
was
told
had
been
already
spent
and
only
a
fifth
of
the
work
was
done
meanwhile
the
human
vultures
have
gathered
to
the
spoil
speculators
adventurers
card
sharpers
hell
keepers
and
doubtful
ladies
have
carried
their
charms
to
this
delightful
market
the
scene
of
operations
is
a
damp
tropical
jungle
intensely
hot
swarming
with
mosquitoes
snakes
alligators
scorpions
and
centipedes
the
home
even
as
nature
made
it
of
yellow
fever
typhus
and
dysentery
and
now
made
immeasurably
more
deadly
by
the
multitudes
of
people
who
have
crowded
thither
half
buried
in
mud
lie
about
the
wrecks
of
costly
machinery
consuming
by
rust
sent
out
under
lavish
orders
and
found
unfit
for
the
work
for
which
they
were
intended
unburied
altogether
lie
also
skeletons
of
the
human
machines
which
have
broken
down
there
everything
which
imagination
can
conceive
that
is
ghastly
and
loathsome
seems
to
be
gathered
into
that
locality
just
now
i
was
pressed
to
go
on
and
look
at
the
moral
surroundings
of
greatest
undertaking
of
our
age
but
my
curiosity
was
less
strong
than
my
disgust
i
did
not
see
the
place
and
the
description
which
i
have
given
is
probably
too
highly
coloured
the
accounts
which
reached
me
however
were
uniform
and
consistent
not
one
person
whom
i
met
and
who
could
speak
from
personal
knowledge
had
any
other
story
to
tell
we
looked
again
into
lucia
on
our
way
the
training
squadron
was
lying
outside
and
the
harbour
was
covered
with
boats
full
of
the
big
ships
were
rolling
heavily
they
could
have
eaten
up
rodney
fleet
the
great
de
paris
would
have
been
a
mouthful
to
the
smallest
of
them
man
for
man
officers
and
crew
were
as
good
as
rodney
ever
commanded
yet
somehow
they
produce
small
effect
on
the
imagination
of
the
colonists
the
impression
is
that
they
are
meant
more
for
show
than
for
serious
use
alas
the
stars
and
stripes
on
a
yankee
trader
have
more
to
say
in
the
west
indies
than
the
white
ensigns
of
a
fleet
of
british
at
barbadoes
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
or
see
the
english
mail
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
and
i
hastened
on
board
one
does
not
realise
distance
on
maps
jamaica
belongs
to
the
west
indies
and
the
west
indies
are
a
collective
entity
yet
it
is
removed
from
the
antilles
by
the
diameter
of
the
caribbean
sea
and
is
farther
off
than
gibraltar
from
southampton
thus
it
was
a
voyage
of
several
days
and
i
looked
about
to
see
who
were
to
be
my
companions
there
were
several
spaniards
one
or
two
english
tourists
and
some
ladies
who
never
left
their
cabins
the
captain
was
the
most
remarkable
figure
an
elderly
man
with
one
eye
lost
or
injured
the
other
as
peremptory
as
i
have
often
seen
in
a
human
face
rough
and
prickly
on
the
outside
as
a
pineapple
internally
very
much
resembling
the
same
fruit
for
at
the
bottom
he
was
true
genuine
and
kindly
hearted
very
amusing
and
intimately
known
to
all
travellers
on
the
west
indian
line
in
the
service
of
which
he
had
passed
forty
years
of
his
life
in
his
own
ship
he
was
sovereign
and
recognised
no
superior
bishops
colonial
governors
presidents
of
south
american
republics
were
so
far
as
their
office
went
no
more
to
him
than
other
people
and
as
long
as
they
were
on
board
were
chattels
of
which
he
had
temporary
charge
peer
and
peasant
were
alike
under
his
orders
which
were
absolute
as
the
laws
of
medes
and
persians
on
the
other
hand
his
eye
was
quick
to
see
if
there
was
any
personal
merit
in
a
man
and
if
you
deserved
his
respect
you
would
have
it
one
particular
merit
he
had
which
i
greatly
approved
he
kept
his
cabin
to
himself
and
did
not
turn
it
into
a
smoking
room
as
i
have
known
captains
do
a
great
deal
too
often
all
my
own
thoughts
were
fixed
upon
jamaica
i
had
read
so
much
about
it
that
my
memory
was
full
of
persons
and
scenes
and
adventures
of
which
jamaica
was
the
stage
or
subject
penn
and
venables
and
the
puritan
conquest
and
morgan
and
the
buccaneers
port
royal
crowded
with
spanish
prizes
its
busy
dockyards
and
english
frigates
and
privateers
fitting
out
there
for
glorious
or
desperate
enterprises
the
name
of
jamaica
brought
them
crowding
up
with
incident
on
incident
and
behind
the
history
came
tom
cringle
and
the
wild
and
reckless
yet
wholesome
and
hearty
planter
life
in
kingston
the
dark
figures
of
the
pirates
swinging
above
the
mangroves
at
gallows
point
the
balls
and
parties
and
the
beautiful
quadroons
and
the
laughing
merry
innocent
children
of
darkness
with
the
tricks
of
the
middies
upon
them
there
was
the
tragic
side
of
it
too
in
slavery
the
last
ugly
flash
out
of
the
cloud
being
not
two
decades
distant
in
the
eyre
and
gordon
time
interest
enough
there
was
about
jamaica
and
things
would
be
strangely
changed
in
kingston
if
nothing
remained
of
the
society
which
was
once
so
brilliant
there
if
anywhere
england
and
english
rule
were
not
yet
a
vanished
quantity
there
was
a
dockyard
still
and
a
commodore
in
command
and
a
guardship
and
gunboats
and
english
regiments
and
west
indian
regiments
with
english
officers
some
representatives
too
i
knew
were
to
be
found
of
the
old
indians
men
whose
fathers
and
grandfathers
were
born
in
the
island
and
whose
fortunes
were
bound
up
in
it
aaron
bang
what
would
not
one
have
given
to
meet
aaron
the
real
aaron
had
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
nature
does
not
make
two
such
as
he
was
but
i
might
fall
in
with
something
that
would
remind
me
of
him
paul
gelid
and
pepperpot
wagtail
and
peter
mangrove
better
than
either
of
them
the
likeness
of
these
might
be
surviving
and
it
would
be
delightful
to
meet
and
talk
to
them
they
would
give
fresh
flavour
to
the
immortal
even
another
tom
was
not
impossible
some
middy
to
develop
hereafter
into
a
frigate
captain
and
to
sail
again
into
port
royal
with
his
prizes
in
tow
nature
at
all
events
could
not
be
changed
the
white
rollers
would
still
be
breaking
on
the
coral
reefs
the
palms
would
still
be
waving
on
the
sand
ridge
which
forms
the
harbour
and
the
amber
mist
would
be
floating
round
the
peaks
of
the
blue
mountains
there
were
english
soldiers
and
sailors
and
english
people
the
english
language
was
spoken
there
by
blacks
as
well
as
whites
the
religion
was
english
our
country
went
for
something
and
there
would
be
some
persons
at
least
to
whom
the
old
land
was
more
than
a
stepmother
and
who
were
not
sighing
in
their
hearts
for
annexation
to
the
american
union
the
governor
sir
henry
norman
of
indian
fame
i
was
sorry
to
learn
was
still
absent
he
had
gone
home
on
some
legal
business
sir
henry
had
an
imperial
reputation
he
had
been
spoken
of
to
me
in
barbadoes
as
able
if
he
were
allowed
a
chance
to
act
as
viceroy
of
all
the
islands
and
to
set
them
on
their
feet
again
i
could
well
believe
that
a
man
of
less
than
sir
reputed
power
could
do
it
for
in
the
thing
itself
there
was
no
great
difficulty
if
only
we
at
home
were
once
disenchanted
though
all
the
ability
in
the
world
would
be
thrown
away
as
long
as
the
enchantment
continued
i
did
see
sir
henry
as
it
turned
out
but
only
for
a
few
hours
our
voyage
was
without
remarkable
incident
as
voyages
are
apt
to
be
in
these
days
of
powerful
steamboats
one
morning
there
was
a
tropical
rain
storm
which
was
worth
seeing
we
had
a
strong
awning
over
the
so
i
could
stand
and
watch
it
an
cloud
came
suddenly
up
from
the
north
which
seemed
to
hang
into
the
sea
the
surface
of
the
water
below
being
violently
agitated
according
to
popular
belief
the
cloud
on
these
occasions
is
drawing
up
water
which
it
afterwards
discharges
were
this
so
the
water
discharged
would
be
salt
which
it
never
is
the
cause
of
the
agitation
is
a
cyclonic
rotation
of
air
or
local
whirlwind
the
most
noticeable
feature
was
the
blackness
of
the
cloud
itself
it
became
so
dark
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
read
any
ordinary
print
the
rain
when
it
burst
fell
not
in
drops
but
in
torrents
the
deck
was
flooded
and
the
ran
like
jets
from
a
pump
the
awning
was
ceasing
to
be
a
shelter
for
the
water
was
driven
bodily
through
it
but
the
downpour
passed
off
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
there
was
no
lightning
and
no
wind
the
sea
under
our
side
was
glassy
smooth
and
was
dashed
into
millions
of
holes
by
the
plunging
of
the
rain
pellets
the
captain
in
his
journeys
to
and
fro
had
become
acquainted
with
the
present
black
president
of
hayti
salomon
i
had
heard
of
this
gentleman
as
an
absolute
person
who
knew
how
to
make
himself
obeyed
and
who
treated
opposition
to
his
authority
in
a
very
summary
manner
he
seemed
to
be
a
favourite
of
the
captain
he
had
been
educated
in
france
had
met
with
many
changes
of
fortune
and
after
an
exile
in
jamaica
had
become
of
the
black
republic
i
much
wished
to
see
this
paradise
of
negro
liberty
we
were
to
touch
at
jacmel
which
is
one
of
the
principal
ports
to
leave
the
mails
and
captain
w
was
good
enough
to
say
that
if
i
liked
i
might
go
ashore
for
an
hour
or
two
with
the
officer
in
charge
hayti
as
everyone
knows
who
has
studied
the
black
problem
is
the
western
portion
of
columbus
española
or
domingo
the
largest
after
cuba
and
the
most
fertile
in
natural
resources
of
all
the
islands
of
the
caribbean
sea
it
was
the
earliest
of
the
spanish
settlements
in
the
new
world
the
spaniards
found
there
a
million
or
two
of
mild
and
innocent
indians
whom
in
their
first
enthusiasm
they
intended
to
convert
to
christianity
and
to
offer
as
the
first
fruits
of
their
discovery
to
the
virgin
mary
and
domenic
the
saint
gave
his
name
to
the
island
and
his
temperament
to
the
conquerors
in
carrying
out
their
pious
design
they
converted
the
indians
off
the
face
of
the
earth
working
them
to
death
in
their
mines
and
plantations
they
filled
their
places
with
blacks
from
africa
who
proved
of
tougher
constitution
they
colonised
they
built
cities
they
throve
and
prospered
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
when
hayti
the
most
valuable
half
of
the
island
was
taken
from
them
by
the
buccaneers
and
made
into
a
french
province
the
rest
which
keeps
the
title
of
domingo
continued
spanish
and
is
spanish
still
a
thinly
inhabited
miserable
spanish
republic
hayti
became
afterwards
the
theatre
of
the
exploits
of
the
toussaint
when
the
french
revolution
broke
out
and
liberty
and
the
rights
of
man
became
the
new
gospel
slavery
could
not
be
allowed
to
continue
in
the
french
dominions
the
blacks
of
the
colony
were
emancipated
and
were
received
into
the
national
brotherhood
in
sympathy
with
the
jacobins
of
france
who
burnt
the
chateaux
of
the
nobles
and
guillotined
the
owners
of
them
the
liberated
slaves
rose
as
soon
as
they
were
free
and
massacred
the
whole
french
population
man
woman
and
child
napoleon
sent
an
army
to
punish
the
murderers
and
recover
the
colony
toussaint
who
had
no
share
in
the
atrocities
and
whose
fault
was
only
that
he
had
been
caught
by
the
prevailing
political
epidemic
and
believed
in
the
evangel
of
freedom
surrendered
and
was
carried
to
france
where
he
died
or
else
was
made
an
end
of
the
yellow
fever
avenged
him
and
secured
for
his
countrymen
the
opportunity
of
trying
out
to
the
uttermost
the
experiment
of
negro
the
french
troops
perished
in
tens
of
thousands
they
were
reinforced
again
and
again
but
it
was
like
pouring
water
into
a
sieve
the
climate
won
a
victory
to
the
black
man
which
he
could
not
win
for
himself
they
abandoned
their
enterprise
at
last
and
hayti
was
free
we
english
tried
our
hand
to
recover
it
afterwards
but
we
failed
also
and
for
the
same
reason
hayti
has
thus
for
nearly
a
century
been
a
black
independent
state
the
negro
race
have
had
it
to
themselves
and
have
not
been
interfered
with
they
were
equipped
when
they
started
on
their
career
of
freedom
with
the
catholic
religion
a
civilised
language
european
laws
and
manners
and
the
knowledge
of
various
arts
and
occupations
which
they
had
learnt
while
they
were
slaves
they
speak
french
still
they
are
nominally
catholics
still
and
the
tags
and
rags
of
the
gold
lace
of
french
civilisation
continue
to
cling
about
their
institutions
but
in
the
heart
of
them
has
revived
the
old
idolatry
of
the
gold
coast
and
in
the
villages
of
the
interior
where
they
are
out
of
sight
and
can
follow
their
instincts
they
sacrifice
children
in
the
serpent
honour
after
the
manner
of
their
forefathers
perhaps
nothing
better
could
be
expected
from
a
liberty
which
was
inaugurated
by
assassination
and
plunder
political
changes
which
prove
successful
do
not
begin
in
that
way
the
bight
of
leogane
is
a
deep
bay
carved
in
the
side
of
the
island
one
arm
of
which
is
a
narrow
ridge
of
high
mountains
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
long
and
from
thirty
to
forty
wide
at
the
head
of
this
bay
to
the
north
of
the
ridge
is
port
au
prince
the
capital
of
this
remarkable
community
on
the
south
on
the
immediately
opposite
side
of
the
mountains
and
facing
the
caribbean
sea
is
jacmel
the
town
next
in
importance
we
arrived
off
it
shortly
after
daybreak
the
houses
which
are
white
looked
cheerful
in
the
sunlight
harbour
there
was
none
but
an
open
roadstead
into
which
the
swell
of
the
sea
sets
heavily
curling
over
a
long
coral
reef
which
forms
a
partial
shelter
the
mountain
range
rose
behind
sloping
off
into
rounded
woody
hills
here
were
the
feeding
grounds
of
the
herds
of
wild
cattle
which
tempted
the
buccaneers
into
the
island
and
from
which
they
took
their
name
the
shore
was
abrupt
the
land
broke
off
in
cliffs
of
coral
rock
tinted
brilliantly
with
various
colours
one
rather
striking
a
ship
officer
assured
me
was
chalk
adding
flint
when
i
looked
incredulous
his
geological
education
was
imperfect
we
brought
up
a
mile
outside
the
black
city
the
boat
was
lowered
none
of
the
other
passengers
volunteered
to
go
with
me
the
english
are
out
of
favour
in
hayti
just
now
the
captain
discouraged
landings
out
of
mere
curiosity
and
indeed
the
officer
with
the
mails
had
to
reassure
himself
of
captain
w
consent
before
he
would
take
me
the
presence
of
europeans
in
any
form
is
barely
tolerated
a
few
only
are
allowed
to
remain
about
the
ports
just
as
the
irish
say
they
let
a
few
danes
remain
in
dublin
and
waterford
after
the
battle
of
clontarf
to
attend
to
the
ignoble
business
of
trade
the
country
after
the
green
of
the
antilles
looked
brown
and
parched
in
the
large
islands
the
winter
months
are
dry
as
we
approached
the
reef
we
saw
the
long
hills
of
water
turn
to
emerald
as
they
rolled
up
the
shoal
then
combing
and
breaking
in
cataracts
of
foam
the
officer
in
charge
took
me
within
oar
length
of
the
rock
to
try
my
nerves
and
the
sea
he
did
not
fail
to
tell
me
swarmed
with
sharks
of
the
worst
propensities
two
steamers
were
lying
inside
one
of
which
belonging
to
an
english
company
had
a
misfortune
and
was
breaking
up
as
a
deserted
wreck
a
yankee
clipper
schooner
had
just
come
in
with
salt
fish
and
crackers
a
singularly
beautiful
vessel
with
immense
beam
which
would
have
startled
the
builders
of
the
cowes
racers
it
was
precisely
like
the
schooner
which
tom
cringle
commanded
before
the
dockyard
martinets
had
improved
her
into
ugliness
built
on
the
lines
of
the
old
pirate
craft
of
the
islands
when
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
men
hung
on
the
extra
speed
or
the
point
which
they
could
lie
closer
to
the
wind
her
return
cargo
would
be
coffee
and
bananas
englishmen
move
about
in
jacmel
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
themselves
among
their
dusky
lords
and
masters
i
observed
the
yankee
skipper
paddling
himself
off
in
a
canoe
with
his
broad
straw
hat
and
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
looking
as
if
all
the
world
belonged
to
him
and
as
if
all
the
world
and
the
hayti
blacks
in
particular
were
aware
of
the
fact
the
yankee
whether
we
like
it
or
not
is
the
acknowledged
sovereign
in
these
waters
the
landing
place
was
or
had
been
a
jetty
built
on
piles
and
boarded
over
half
the
piles
were
broken
the
planks
had
rotted
and
fallen
through
the
swell
was
rolling
home
and
we
had
to
step
out
quickly
as
the
boat
rose
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
a
tattered
crowd
of
negroes
were
loafing
about
variously
dressed
none
however
entirely
without
clothes
of
some
kind
one
of
them
did
kindly
give
me
a
hand
observing
that
i
was
less
light
of
foot
than
once
i
might
have
been
the
agent
office
was
close
by
i
asked
the
head
clerk
a
frenchman
to
find
me
a
guide
through
the
town
he
called
one
of
the
bystanders
whom
he
knew
and
we
started
together
i
and
my
black
companion
to
see
as
much
as
i
could
in
the
hour
which
was
allowed
me
the
language
was
less
hopeless
than
at
dominica
we
found
that
we
could
understand
each
other
he
me
tolerably
i
him
in
fragments
for
his
tongue
went
as
fast
as
a
shuttle
though
it
was
still
barely
eight
the
sun
was
scalding
the
streets
were
filthy
and
the
stench
abominable
the
houses
were
of
white
stone
and
of
some
pretensions
but
ragged
and
uninviting
paint
nowhere
and
the
woodwork
of
the
windows
and
verandahs
mouldy
and
the
inhabitants
swarmed
as
in
a
giles
rookery
i
suppose
they
were
all
out
of
doors
if
any
were
left
at
home
jacmel
must
have
been
as
populous
as
an
african
ants
nest
as
i
had
looked
for
nothing
better
than
a
kaffir
kraal
the
degree
of
civilisation
was
more
than
i
expected
i
expressed
my
admiration
of
the
buildings
my
guide
was
gratified
and
pointed
out
to
me
with
evident
pride
a
new
hotel
or
boarding
house
kept
by
a
madame
somebody
who
was
the
great
lady
of
the
place
madame
ellemême
was
sitting
in
a
shady
balcony
outside
the
windows
she
was
a
large
mulatto
like
some
ogress
of
the
nights
capable
of
devouring
if
she
found
them
palatable
any
number
of
salt
babies
i
took
off
my
hat
to
this
formidable
dame
which
she
did
not
condescend
to
notice
and
we
passed
on
a
few
houses
in
the
outskirts
stood
in
gardens
with
inclosures
about
them
there
is
some
trade
in
the
place
and
there
were
evidently
families
negro
or
european
who
lived
in
less
squalid
style
than
the
generality
there
was
a
governor
there
my
guide
informed
me
an
ornamental
personage
much
respected
to
my
question
whether
he
had
any
soldiers
i
was
answered
the
haytians
did
like
soldiers
i
was
to
understand
however
that
they
were
not
common
blacks
they
aspired
to
be
a
commonwealth
with
public
rights
and
alliances
hayti
a
republic
france
a
republic
france
and
hayti
good
friends
now
they
had
a
french
bishop
and
french
priests
and
a
french
currency
in
spite
of
their
land
laws
they
were
proud
of
their
affinity
with
the
great
nation
and
i
heard
afterwards
though
not
from
my
jacmel
companion
that
the
better
part
of
the
haytians
would
welcome
back
the
french
dominion
if
they
were
not
afraid
that
the
yankees
would
disapprove
my
guide
persisted
in
leading
me
outside
the
town
and
as
my
time
was
limited
i
tried
in
various
ways
to
induce
him
to
take
me
back
into
it
he
maintained
however
that
he
had
been
told
to
show
me
whatever
was
most
interesting
and
i
found
that
i
was
to
see
an
american
which
had
been
just
erected
to
supply
jacmel
with
fresh
water
it
was
the
first
that
had
been
seen
in
the
island
and
was
a
wonder
of
wonders
doubtless
it
implied
and
would
assist
in
the
ablution
of
the
streets
and
kennels
i
looked
at
it
and
admired
and
having
thus
done
homage
i
was
allowed
my
own
way
it
was
market
day
the
yankee
cargo
had
been
unloaded
and
a
great
open
space
in
front
of
the
cathedral
was
covered
with
stalls
or
else
blankets
stretched
on
poles
to
keep
the
sun
off
where
hundreds
of
haytian
dames
were
sitting
or
standing
disposing
of
their
wares
piles
of
salt
fish
piles
of
coloured
calicoes
knives
scissors
combs
and
brushes
of
home
produce
there
were
great
baskets
of
loaves
fruit
vegetables
and
butcher
meat
on
slabs
i
looked
inquisitively
at
these
last
but
i
acknowledge
that
i
saw
no
joints
of
suspicious
appearance
children
were
running
about
in
thousands
not
the
least
as
if
they
were
in
fear
of
being
sacrificed
and
babies
hung
upon
their
mothers
as
if
natural
affection
existed
in
jacmel
as
much
as
in
other
places
i
asked
no
compromising
questions
not
wishing
to
be
torn
in
pieces
sir
spenser
john
book
has
been
heard
of
in
hayti
and
the
anger
about
it
is
considerable
the
scene
was
interesting
enough
but
the
smell
was
unendurable
the
wild
african
black
is
not
filthy
in
his
natural
state
he
washes
much
as
wild
animals
do
and
at
least
tries
to
keep
himself
clear
of
vermin
the
blacks
in
jacmel
appeared
like
the
same
animals
as
soon
as
they
are
domesticated
to
lose
the
sense
which
belongs
to
them
in
their
wild
condition
my
prejudices
if
i
have
any
had
not
blinded
me
to
the
good
qualities
of
the
men
and
women
in
dominica
i
do
not
think
it
was
prejudice
wholly
which
made
me
think
the
faces
which
i
saw
in
hayti
the
most
repulsive
which
i
had
ever
seen
in
the
world
or
jacmel
itself
taken
for
all
in
all
the
foulest
dirtiest
and
nastiest
of
human
habitations
the
dirt
however
i
will
do
them
the
justice
to
say
did
not
seem
to
extend
to
their
churches
the
cathedral
stood
at
the
upper
end
of
the
market
place
i
went
in
it
was
airy
cool
and
some
priests
were
saying
mass
and
there
was
a
fairly
large
congregation
i
wished
to
get
a
nearer
sight
of
the
altar
and
the
images
and
pictures
imagining
that
in
hayti
the
sacred
persons
might
assume
a
darker
colour
than
in
europe
but
i
could
not
reach
the
chancel
without
disturbing
people
who
were
saying
their
prayers
and
to
the
disappointment
of
my
companion
who
beckoned
me
on
and
would
have
cleared
a
way
for
me
i
controlled
my
curiosity
and
withdrew
my
hour
leave
of
absence
was
expired
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
landing
place
where
the
mail
steamer
boat
was
waiting
for
me
on
the
steamer
herself
the
passengers
were
waiting
impatiently
for
breakfast
which
had
been
put
off
on
our
account
we
hurried
on
board
at
our
best
speed
but
before
breakfast
could
be
thought
of
or
any
other
thing
i
had
to
strip
and
plunge
into
a
bath
and
wash
away
the
odour
of
the
great
negro
republic
of
the
west
which
clung
to
my
clothes
and
skin
leaving
jacmel
and
its
associations
we
ran
all
day
along
the
land
skirting
a
range
of
splendid
mountains
between
seven
and
eight
thousand
feet
high
past
the
isle
à
vache
past
the
bay
of
cayes
once
famous
as
the
haunt
of
the
past
cape
tubiron
the
cape
of
sharks
at
evening
we
were
in
the
channel
which
divides
domingo
from
jamaica
captain
insisted
to
me
that
this
was
the
scene
of
rodney
action
and
he
pointed
out
to
me
the
headland
under
which
the
british
fleet
had
been
lying
he
was
probably
right
in
saying
that
it
was
the
scene
of
some
action
of
rodney
for
there
is
hardly
a
corner
of
the
west
indies
where
he
did
not
leave
behind
him
the
print
of
his
cannon
shot
but
it
was
not
the
scene
of
the
great
fight
which
saved
the
british
empire
that
was
below
the
cliffs
of
dominica
and
captain
w
as
many
others
have
done
was
confounding
dominica
with
domingo
the
next
morning
we
were
to
anchor
at
port
royal
we
had
a
jamaica
gentleman
of
some
consequence
on
board
i
had
failed
so
far
to
make
acquaintance
with
him
but
on
this
last
evening
he
joined
me
on
deck
and
i
gladly
used
the
opportunity
to
learn
something
of
the
present
condition
of
things
i
was
mistaken
in
expecting
to
find
a
more
vigorous
or
more
sanguine
tone
of
feeling
than
i
had
left
at
the
antilles
there
was
the
same
despondency
the
same
sense
that
their
state
was
hopeless
and
that
nothing
which
they
could
themselves
do
would
mend
it
he
himself
for
instance
was
the
owner
of
a
large
sugar
estate
which
a
few
years
ago
was
worth
it
was
not
encumbered
he
was
his
own
manager
and
had
spared
no
cost
in
providing
the
newest
machinery
yet
with
the
present
prices
and
with
the
refusal
of
the
american
commercial
treaty
it
would
not
pay
the
expense
of
cultivation
he
held
on
for
it
was
all
that
he
could
do
to
sell
was
impossible
for
no
one
would
buy
even
at
the
price
of
the
stock
on
the
land
it
was
the
same
story
which
i
had
heard
everywhere
the
expenses
of
the
administration
this
gentleman
said
were
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
resources
of
the
island
and
were
yearly
increasing
the
planters
had
governed
in
the
old
days
as
the
english
landlords
had
governed
ireland
they
had
governed
cheaply
and
on
their
own
resources
they
had
authority
they
were
respected
their
word
was
law
now
their
power
had
been
taken
from
them
and
made
over
to
paid
officials
and
the
expense
was
double
what
it
used
to
be
between
the
demands
made
on
them
in
the
form
of
taxation
and
the
fall
in
the
value
of
their
produce
their
backs
were
breaking
and
the
interest
would
come
to
an
end
i
asked
him
as
i
had
asked
many
persons
without
getting
a
satisfactory
answer
what
he
thought
that
the
imperial
government
could
do
to
mend
matters
he
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
the
blacks
were
increasing
so
fast
and
the
white
influence
was
diminishing
so
fast
that
jamaica
in
a
few
years
would
be
another
hayti
in
this
gentleman
too
i
found
to
my
sorrow
that
there
was
the
same
longing
for
admission
to
the
american
union
which
i
had
left
behind
me
at
the
antilles
in
spite
of
soldiers
and
the
naval
station
the
old
country
was
still
looked
upon
as
a
stepmother
and
of
genuine
loyalty
there
was
according
to
him
little
or
nothing
if
the
west
indies
were
ever
to
become
prosperous
again
it
could
only
be
when
they
were
annexed
to
the
united
states
for
the
present
at
least
he
admitted
that
annexation
was
impossible
not
on
account
of
any
possible
objection
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
for
it
seems
to
be
assumed
by
every
one
that
the
british
government
cares
nothing
what
they
do
nor
wholly
on
account
of
the
objections
of
the
americans
though
he
admitted
that
the
americans
were
unwilling
to
receive
them
but
because
in
the
existing
state
of
feeling
such
a
change
could
not
be
carried
out
without
civil
war
in
jamaica
at
least
the
blacks
and
mulattoes
would
resist
there
were
nearly
of
them
while
of
the
whites
there
were
but
and
the
relative
numbers
were
every
year
becoming
more
unfavourable
the
blacks
knew
that
under
england
they
had
nothing
to
fear
they
would
have
everything
more
and
more
their
own
way
and
in
a
short
time
they
expected
to
have
the
island
to
themselves
they
might
collect
arms
they
might
do
what
they
pleased
and
no
english
officer
dared
to
use
rough
measures
with
them
while
if
they
belonged
to
the
union
the
whites
would
recover
authority
one
way
or
another
the
americans
were
ready
with
their
rifles
on
occasions
of
disorder
and
their
own
countrymen
did
not
call
them
to
account
for
it
as
we
did
the
blacks
therefore
preferred
the
liberty
which
they
had
and
the
prospects
to
which
they
looked
forward
and
they
and
the
mulattoes
also
would
fight
and
fight
desperately
before
they
would
allow
themselves
to
be
made
american
citizens
the
prospect
which
laid
before
me
was
not
a
beautiful
one
and
was
coming
a
step
nearer
at
each
advance
that
was
made
in
the
direction
of
constitutional
for
like
every
other
person
with
whom
i
spoke
on
the
subject
he
said
emphatically
that
europeans
would
not
remain
to
be
ruled
under
a
black
representative
system
nor
would
they
take
any
part
in
it
when
they
would
be
so
overwhelmingly
outvoted
and
outnumbered
they
would
sooner
forfeit
all
that
they
had
in
the
world
and
go
away
an
effective
and
economical
administration
on
the
indian
pattern
might
have
saved
all
a
few
years
ago
it
was
too
late
now
and
jamaica
was
past
recovery
at
this
rate
it
was
a
sadly
altered
jamaica
since
tom
cringle
time
though
his
friend
aaron
even
then
had
seen
what
was
probably
coming
but
i
could
not
accept
entirely
all
that
had
been
saying
and
had
to
discount
the
natural
irritation
of
a
man
who
sees
his
fortune
sliding
out
of
his
hands
moreover
for
myself
i
never
listen
much
to
a
desponding
person
even
when
a
cause
is
lost
utterly
and
no
rational
hope
remains
i
would
still
go
down
if
it
had
to
be
so
with
my
spirit
unbroken
and
my
face
to
the
enemy
perhaps
would
recover
heart
if
the
price
of
sugar
mended
a
little
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
care
much
whether
it
mends
or
not
the
economics
of
the
islands
ought
not
to
depend
exclusively
on
any
single
article
of
produce
i
believe
too
in
spite
of
gloomy
prognostics
that
a
loyal
and
prosperous
jamaica
is
still
among
the
possibilities
of
the
future
if
we
will
but
study
in
earnest
the
character
of
the
problem
however
did
most
really
convey
to
me
the
convictions
of
a
large
and
influential
body
of
west
indians
convictions
on
which
they
are
already
acting
and
will
act
more
and
more
with
hayti
so
close
and
with
opinion
in
england
indifferent
to
what
becomes
of
them
they
will
clear
out
while
they
have
something
left
to
lose
and
will
not
wait
till
ruin
is
upon
them
or
till
they
are
ordered
off
the
land
by
a
black
legislature
there
is
a
saying
in
hayti
that
the
white
man
has
no
rights
which
the
blacks
are
bound
to
recognise
i
walked
forward
after
we
had
done
talking
we
had
five
hundred
of
the
poor
creatures
on
board
on
their
way
to
the
darien
pandemonium
the
vessel
was
rolling
with
a
heavy
beam
sea
i
found
the
whole
mass
of
them
reduced
into
the
condition
of
the
pigs
who
used
to
occupy
the
foredeck
in
the
cork
and
bristol
packets
they
were
lying
in
a
confused
heap
together
helpless
miserable
without
consciousness
apparently
save
a
sense
in
each
that
he
was
wretched
unfortunate
following
the
laws
of
political
economy
and
carrying
their
labour
to
the
dearest
market
where
before
a
year
was
out
half
of
them
were
to
die
they
had
souls
too
some
of
them
and
honest
and
kindly
hearts
i
observed
one
man
who
was
suffering
less
than
the
rest
reading
aloud
to
a
prostrate
group
a
chapter
of
the
new
testament
another
was
reading
to
himself
a
french
catholic
book
of
devotion
the
dawn
was
breaking
in
the
east
when
i
came
on
deck
in
the
morning
the
blue
mountains
were
hanging
over
us
on
our
right
hand
the
peaks
buried
in
white
mist
which
the
unrisen
sun
was
faintly
tinting
with
orange
we
had
passed
morant
bay
the
scene
of
gordon
rash
attempt
to
imitate
toussaint
as
so
often
in
the
antilles
a
level
plain
stretched
between
the
sea
and
the
base
of
the
hills
formed
by
the
debris
washed
down
by
the
rivers
in
the
rainy
season
among
cane
fields
and
groves
we
saw
houses
and
the
chimneys
of
the
sugar
factories
and
as
we
came
nearer
we
saw
men
and
horses
going
to
their
early
work
presently
kingston
itself
came
in
sight
and
up
park
camp
and
the
white
barracks
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
of
which
one
had
read
and
heard
so
much
here
was
actually
tom
cringle
kingston
and
between
us
and
the
town
was
the
long
sand
spit
which
incloses
the
lagoon
at
the
head
of
which
kingston
is
built
how
this
natural
breakwater
had
been
deposited
i
could
find
no
one
to
tell
me
it
is
eight
miles
long
rising
but
a
few
feet
above
the
in
places
not
more
than
thirty
yards
across
nowhere
except
at
the
extremity
more
than
sixty
or
a
hundred
illustration
port
royal
jamaica
the
thundering
swell
of
the
caribbean
sea
breaks
upon
it
from
end
to
year
end
and
never
washes
it
any
thinner
where
the
sand
is
dry
beyond
the
reach
of
the
waves
it
is
planted
thickly
all
along
with
palms
and
appears
from
the
sea
a
soft
green
line
over
which
appear
the
masts
and
spars
of
the
vessels
at
anchor
in
the
harbour
and
the
higher
houses
of
kingston
itself
to
reach
the
opening
into
the
lagoon
you
have
to
run
on
to
the
end
of
the
sandbank
where
there
is
a
peninsula
on
which
is
built
the
port
royal
so
famous
in
west
indian
story
halfway
down
among
the
palms
the
lighthouse
stands
from
which
a
gun
was
fired
as
we
passed
to
give
notice
that
the
english
mail
was
coming
in
treacherous
coral
reefs
rise
out
of
the
deep
water
for
several
miles
some
under
water
and
visible
only
by
the
breakers
over
them
others
forming
into
low
wooded
islands
only
local
pilots
can
take
a
ship
safely
through
these
powerful
natural
defence
works
there
are
but
two
channels
through
which
the
lagoon
can
be
approached
the
eastern
passage
along
which
we
were
steaming
runs
so
near
the
shore
that
an
enemy
ship
would
be
destroyed
by
the
batteries
among
the
sandhills
long
before
it
could
reach
the
mouth
the
western
passage
is
less
intricate
but
that
also
is
commanded
by
powerful
forts
in
old
times
kingston
was
unattackable
so
strong
had
the
position
been
made
by
nature
and
art
combined
it
could
be
shelled
now
over
the
spit
from
the
open
sea
it
might
be
destroyed
but
even
so
could
not
easily
be
taken
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
ever
seen
any
scene
more
interesting
than
that
which
broke
upon
my
eyes
as
we
rounded
the
point
and
the
lagoon
opened
out
before
me
kingston
which
we
had
passed
half
an
hour
before
lay
six
miles
off
at
the
head
of
the
bay
now
inside
the
sand
ridge
blue
and
hazy
in
the
distance
at
the
back
were
the
mountains
the
mist
had
melted
off
standing
in
shadowy
grey
masses
with
the
sun
rising
behind
them
immediately
in
front
were
the
dockyards
forts
and
towers
of
port
royal
with
the
guardship
gunboats
and
tenders
with
street
and
terrace
roof
and
turret
and
glistening
vane
all
clearly
and
sharply
defined
in
the
exquisite
transparency
of
the
air
the
associations
of
the
place
no
doubt
added
to
the
impression
before
the
first
hut
was
run
up
in
kingston
port
royal
was
the
rendezvous
of
all
english
ships
which
for
spoil
or
commerce
frequented
the
west
indian
seas
here
the
buccaneers
sold
their
plunder
and
squandered
their
gains
in
gambling
and
riot
here
in
the
later
century
of
legitimate
wars
whole
fleets
were
gathered
to
take
in
stores
or
refit
when
shattered
by
engagements
here
nelson
had
been
and
collingwood
and
jervis
and
all
our
other
naval
heroes
here
prizes
were
brought
in
for
adjudication
and
pirates
to
be
tried
and
hanged
in
this
spot
more
than
in
any
other
beyond
great
britain
herself
the
energy
of
the
empire
once
was
throbbing
the
an
old
and
three
gunboats
were
all
that
were
now
floating
in
the
once
crowded
water
the
no
longer
equipped
for
active
service
imperfectly
armed
inadequately
manned
but
still
flaunting
the
broad
white
ensign
and
as
if
grandly
watching
over
the
houses
which
lay
behind
her
there
were
batteries
at
the
point
and
batteries
on
the
opposite
shore
the
morning
bugle
rang
out
clear
and
inspiriting
from
the
town
and
white
coats
and
gold
and
silver
lace
glanced
in
and
out
as
men
and
officers
were
passing
to
parade
here
at
any
rate
england
was
still
alive
the
channel
at
the
entrance
is
a
mile
in
width
the
lagoon
the
open
part
of
it
may
be
seven
or
eight
miles
long
and
half
as
many
broad
it
forms
the
mouth
of
the
cobre
river
one
of
the
largest
in
jamaica
on
which
ten
miles
up
stands
the
original
seat
of
government
established
by
the
spaniards
and
called
after
them
spanish
town
the
fashion
of
past
times
as
old
as
the
times
of
thucydides
and
continued
on
till
the
end
of
the
last
century
was
to
choose
the
sites
for
important
towns
in
estuaries
at
a
distance
from
the
sea
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
pirates
the
cobre
running
down
from
spanish
town
turns
the
plain
through
which
it
flows
into
a
swamp
the
swamp
covers
itself
with
mangroves
and
the
mangroves
fringe
the
shore
of
the
lagoon
itself
for
of
its
circuit
as
jamaica
grew
in
wealth
and
population
the
trade
was
carried
from
port
royal
deeper
into
the
bay
another
town
sprang
up
there
called
king
town
or
shortly
the
administration
was
removed
thither
for
convenience
and
though
fallen
away
from
its
old
consequence
kingston
with
its
extended
suburbs
its
churches
and
warehouses
and
large
mansions
overhung
with
trees
looks
at
a
distance
like
a
place
of
consideration
many
ships
lay
along
the
wharves
or
anchored
a
few
cables
distance
off
among
them
were
a
couple
of
spanish
frigates
which
remain
there
in
permanence
on
the
watch
for
refugees
from
cuba
on
the
slopes
behind
the
town
as
far
as
eye
could
see
were
the
once
splendid
estates
of
the
sugar
princes
of
the
last
century
one
of
them
was
pointed
out
to
me
as
the
west
indian
home
of
the
author
of
cringle
we
had
to
stop
for
a
few
minutes
as
the
officer
of
the
port
came
alongside
for
the
mails
we
then
went
on
at
reduced
speed
the
lagoon
is
generally
shoal
a
deep
water
channel
runs
along
the
side
of
it
which
is
farthest
from
the
sea
made
i
suppose
by
the
river
for
as
usual
there
is
little
tide
or
none
halfway
up
we
passed
under
the
walls
of
fort
augusta
now
a
ruin
and
almost
deserted
but
once
mounting
a
hundred
guns
the
money
which
we
spent
on
the
defence
of
jamaica
in
the
old
times
was
not
always
laid
out
wisely
as
will
be
seen
in
an
account
which
i
shall
have
to
give
of
this
remarkable
structure
but
at
any
rate
we
were
lavish
of
it
of
the
sharks
with
which
the
water
used
to
swarm
we
saw
none
port
royal
jack
and
his
kindred
are
said
to
have
disappeared
driven
or
frightened
out
by
the
screws
of
the
steamers
but
it
is
not
a
place
which
i
should
choose
for
a
swim
nor
did
the
nigger
boys
seem
as
anxious
as
i
had
seen
them
in
other
spots
to
dive
for
sixpences
under
the
ship
side
no
account
is
made
of
days
when
you
come
into
port
after
a
voyage
cargoes
have
to
be
landed
or
coal
has
to
be
taken
in
the
donkey
engines
are
at
work
hoisting
packing
cases
and
luggage
out
of
the
hold
stewards
run
to
and
fro
and
doors
are
opened
and
busy
figures
are
seen
through
each
stuffing
their
portmanteaus
and
preparing
for
departure
the
church
bells
at
kingston
ringing
for
early
service
reminded
me
that
it
was
sunday
we
brought
up
at
a
jetty
and
i
can
not
say
that
close
at
hand
the
town
was
as
attractive
as
it
had
appeared
when
first
i
saw
it
the
enchantment
was
gone
the
blue
haze
of
distance
gave
place
to
reality
the
water
was
so
fetid
under
the
ship
side
that
it
could
not
be
pumped
into
the
baths
odours
not
arabian
from
open
drains
reminded
me
of
jacmel
the
streets
up
which
i
could
see
from
the
afterdeck
looked
dirty
and
the
houses
shabby
docks
and
wharves
however
are
never
the
brightest
part
of
any
town
english
or
foreign
there
were
people
enough
at
any
rate
and
white
faces
enough
among
them
gangways
were
rigged
from
the
ship
to
the
shore
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
rushed
on
board
to
meet
their
friends
the
companies
agents
appeared
in
the
captain
cabin
porters
were
scrambling
for
luggage
pushing
shoving
and
swearing
passengers
who
had
come
out
with
us
and
had
never
missed
attendance
at
the
breakfast
table
were
hurrying
home
unbreakfasted
to
their
wives
and
families
my
own
plans
were
uncertain
i
had
no
friends
not
even
an
acquaintance
i
knew
nothing
of
the
hotels
and
lodging
houses
save
that
they
had
generally
a
doubtful
reputation
i
had
brought
with
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
sir
norman
the
governor
but
sir
henry
had
gone
to
england
on
the
whole
i
thought
it
best
to
inclose
the
letter
to
walker
the
colonial
secretary
who
i
understood
was
in
kingston
with
a
note
asking
for
advice
this
i
sent
by
a
messenger
meanwhile
i
stayed
on
board
to
look
about
me
from
the
deck
the
ship
was
to
go
on
the
next
morning
to
the
canal
works
at
darien
time
was
precious
immediately
on
arriving
she
had
begun
to
take
in
coal
sunday
though
it
might
be
and
a
singular
spectacle
it
was
the
coal
yard
was
close
by
and
some
hundreds
of
negroes
women
and
men
but
women
in
four
times
the
number
were
hard
at
work
the
entire
process
was
by
hand
and
basket
each
basket
holding
from
eighty
to
a
hundred
pounds
weight
two
planks
were
laid
down
at
a
steep
incline
from
the
ship
deck
to
the
yard
swinging
their
loads
on
their
heads
erect
as
statues
and
with
a
step
elastic
as
a
racehorse
they
marched
up
one
of
the
planks
emptied
their
baskets
into
the
coal
bunkers
and
ran
down
the
other
round
and
round
they
went
under
the
blazing
sun
all
the
morning
through
and
round
and
round
they
would
continue
to
go
all
the
afternoon
the
men
took
it
comparatively
easy
the
women
flew
along
laughing
and
clamouring
as
if
not
knowing
what
weariness
was
willing
beasts
of
burden
for
they
had
the
care
upon
them
of
their
children
the
men
disclaiming
all
responsibilities
on
that
score
after
the
babies
have
been
once
brought
into
the
world
the
poor
women
are
content
with
the
arrangement
which
they
prefer
to
what
they
would
regard
as
legal
bondage
they
earn
at
this
coaling
work
seven
or
eight
shillings
a
day
if
they
were
wives
their
husbands
would
take
it
from
them
and
spend
it
in
rum
the
companion
who
is
not
a
wife
can
refuse
and
keep
her
earnings
for
her
little
ones
if
black
suffrage
is
to
be
the
rule
in
jamaica
i
would
take
it
away
from
the
men
and
would
give
it
to
the
superior
sex
the
women
are
the
working
bees
of
the
hive
they
would
make
a
tolerable
nation
of
black
amazons
and
the
babies
would
not
be
offered
to
jumbi
when
i
had
finished
my
meditations
on
the
coaling
women
there
were
other
black
creatures
to
wonder
at
great
boobies
or
pelicans
old
acquaintances
of
the
zoological
gardens
who
act
as
scavengers
in
these
waters
we
had
perhaps
a
couple
of
dozen
of
them
round
us
as
large
as
vultures
ponderous
and
sleepy
to
look
at
when
squatting
on
rocks
or
piles
by
their
enormous
bills
on
the
wing
they
were
astonishingly
swift
wheeling
in
circles
till
they
could
fix
their
prey
with
their
eyes
then
pouncing
upon
it
with
a
violent
slanting
plunge
i
suppose
their
beaks
might
be
broken
if
they
struck
directly
but
i
never
saw
one
miss
its
aim
nor
do
they
ever
go
below
the
surface
but
seize
always
what
is
close
to
it
i
was
told
i
do
not
know
how
truly
that
like
the
diablots
in
dominica
they
nest
in
the
mountains
and
only
come
down
to
the
sea
to
feed
hearing
that
i
was
in
search
of
quarters
a
miss
burton
a
handsome
mulatto
woman
came
up
and
introduced
herself
to
me
hotels
in
the
english
west
indies
are
generally
detestable
this
dame
had
set
up
a
boarding
house
on
improved
principles
or
rather
two
boarding
houses
between
which
she
invited
me
to
take
my
choice
one
in
the
suburbs
of
kingston
one
on
the
bank
of
a
river
in
a
rocky
gorge
in
the
blue
mountains
in
either
of
these
she
promised
that
she
would
make
me
happy
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
she
would
have
succeeded
for
her
fame
had
spread
through
all
jamaica
and
her
face
was
as
merry
as
it
was
honest
as
it
turned
out
i
was
provided
for
elsewhere
and
i
lost
the
chance
of
making
an
acquaintance
which
i
should
have
valued
when
she
spoke
to
me
she
seemed
a
very
model
of
vigour
and
health
she
died
suddenly
while
i
was
in
the
island
the
day
was
still
early
when
the
vessel
was
in
some
order
again
and
those
who
were
going
on
shore
had
disappeared
the
rest
of
us
were
called
down
to
breakfast
to
taste
some
of
those
jamaica
delicacies
on
which
paul
gelid
was
so
eloquent
the
fruit
was
the
chief
attraction
pineapples
of
which
one
can
eat
as
much
as
one
likes
in
these
countries
with
immunity
from
after
suffering
oranges
more
excellent
than
even
those
of
grenada
and
dominica
shaddocks
admirable
as
that
memorable
one
which
seduced
adam
and
for
the
first
time
mangoes
the
famous
number
eleven
of
which
i
had
heard
such
high
report
and
was
now
to
taste
the
english
gardeners
can
do
much
but
they
can
not
ripen
a
number
eleven
and
it
is
too
delicate
to
bear
carriage
it
must
be
eaten
in
the
tropics
or
nowhere
the
mango
is
the
size
and
shape
of
a
swan
egg
of
a
ruddy
yellow
colour
when
ripe
and
in
flavour
like
an
exceptionally
good
apricot
with
a
very
slight
intimation
of
resin
the
stone
is
disproportionately
large
the
flesh
adheres
to
it
and
one
abandons
as
hopeless
the
attempt
to
eat
mangoes
with
clean
lips
and
fingers
the
epicures
insist
that
they
should
be
eaten
only
in
a
bath
the
heat
was
considerable
and
the
feast
of
fruit
was
the
more
welcome
soon
after
the
colonial
secretary
politely
answered
my
note
in
person
in
the
absence
of
the
governor
of
a
colony
the
colonial
secretary
as
a
rule
takes
his
place
in
jamaica
and
wherever
we
have
a
garrison
the
commander
of
the
forces
becomes
acting
governor
i
suppose
because
it
is
not
convenient
to
place
an
officer
of
high
military
rank
under
the
orders
of
a
civilian
who
is
not
the
direct
representative
of
the
sovereign
in
the
gentleman
who
now
called
on
me
i
found
an
old
acquaintance
whom
i
had
known
as
a
boy
many
years
ago
he
told
me
that
if
i
had
made
no
other
arrangements
colonel
j
who
was
the
present
chief
was
expecting
me
to
be
his
guest
at
the
house
during
my
stay
in
jamaica
my
reluctance
to
trespass
on
the
hospitality
of
an
entire
stranger
was
not
to
be
allowed
soldiers
who
have
distinguished
themselves
are
next
to
lawyers
the
most
agreeable
people
to
be
met
with
and
when
i
was
convinced
that
i
should
really
be
welcome
i
had
no
other
objection
an
i
was
told
would
call
for
me
in
the
afternoon
meanwhile
the
secretary
stayed
with
me
for
an
hour
or
two
and
i
was
able
to
learn
something
authentic
from
him
as
to
the
general
condition
of
things
i
had
not
given
entire
credit
to
the
representations
of
my
planter
friend
of
the
evening
before
walker
took
a
more
cheerful
view
and
although
the
prospects
were
not
as
bright
as
they
might
be
he
saw
no
reason
for
despondency
sugar
was
down
of
course
the
public
debt
had
increased
and
taxation
was
heavy
many
gentlemen
in
jamaica
as
in
the
antilles
were
selling
or
trying
to
sell
their
estates
and
go
out
of
it
on
the
other
hand
expenses
of
government
were
being
reduced
and
the
revenue
showed
a
surplus
the
fruit
trade
with
the
united
states
was
growing
and
promised
to
grow
still
further
american
capitalists
had
come
into
the
island
and
were
experimenting
on
various
industries
the
sugar
treaty
with
america
would
naturally
have
been
welcome
but
jamaica
was
less
dependent
on
its
sugar
crop
and
the
action
of
the
british
government
was
less
keenly
resented
in
the
antilles
the
colonial
secretary
admitted
there
might
be
a
desire
for
annexation
to
the
united
states
and
jamaican
landowners
had
certainly
expressed
the
same
wish
to
myself
walker
however
assured
me
that
while
the
blacks
would
oppose
it
unanimously
the
feeling
if
it
existed
at
all
among
the
whites
was
confined
as
yet
to
a
very
few
persons
they
had
been
english
for
years
and
the
large
majority
of
them
wished
to
remain
english
there
had
been
suffering
among
them
but
there
had
been
suffering
in
other
places
besides
jamaica
better
times
might
perhaps
be
coming
with
the
opening
of
the
darien
canal
when
kingston
might
hope
to
become
again
the
centre
of
a
trade
of
the
negroes
both
men
and
women
walker
spoke
extremely
favourably
they
were
far
less
indolent
than
they
were
supposed
to
be
they
were
settling
on
the
waste
lands
acquiring
property
growing
yams
and
oranges
and
harming
no
one
they
had
no
grievance
left
they
knew
it
and
were
perfectly
contented
as
walker
was
an
official
i
did
not
ask
him
about
the
working
of
the
recent
changes
in
the
constitution
nor
could
he
have
properly
answered
me
if
i
had
the
state
of
things
is
briefly
this
jamaica
after
the
first
settlement
received
a
parliamentary
form
of
government
modelled
on
that
of
ireland
the
colonial
liberties
being
restricted
by
a
law
analogous
to
poynings
act
the
legislature
so
constructed
of
course
represented
the
white
interest
only
and
was
entirely
composed
of
whites
it
remained
substantially
unaltered
till
when
modifications
were
made
which
admitted
coloured
men
to
the
suffrage
though
with
so
high
a
franchise
as
to
be
almost
exclusive
it
became
generally
felt
that
the
franchise
would
have
to
be
extended
a
popular
movement
led
by
gordon
who
was
a
member
of
the
legislature
developed
into
a
riot
into
bloodshed
and
panic
gordon
was
hanged
by
a
and
the
assembly
aware
that
if
allowed
to
exist
any
longer
it
could
exist
only
with
the
broad
admission
of
the
negro
vote
pronounced
its
own
dissolution
surrendered
its
powers
to
the
crown
and
represented
formally
nothing
but
a
strong
government
could
prevent
the
island
from
lapsing
into
the
condition
of
hayti
the
surrender
was
accepted
jamaica
was
administered
till
within
the
last
four
years
by
a
governor
officials
and
council
all
nominated
by
the
queen
no
dissatisfaction
had
been
expressed
and
the
blacks
at
least
had
enjoyed
a
prosperity
and
tranquillity
which
had
been
unbroken
by
a
single
disturbance
if
the
island
has
suffered
it
has
suffered
from
causes
with
which
political
dissatisfaction
has
had
nothing
to
do
and
which
therefore
political
changes
can
not
remove
in
gladstone
government
for
reasons
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
revived
suddenly
the
representative
system
constructed
a
council
composed
equally
of
nominated
and
of
elected
members
and
placed
the
franchise
so
low
as
to
include
practically
every
negro
peasant
who
possessed
a
hut
and
a
garden
so
long
as
the
crown
retains
and
exercises
its
power
of
nomination
no
worse
results
can
ensue
than
the
inevitable
discontent
when
the
votes
of
the
elected
members
are
disregarded
or
overborne
but
to
have
ventured
so
important
an
alteration
with
the
intention
of
leaving
it
without
further
extension
would
have
been
an
act
of
gratuitous
folly
of
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
an
english
cabinet
to
have
been
capable
it
is
therefore
assumed
and
understood
to
have
been
no
more
than
an
initial
step
towards
passing
over
the
management
of
jamaica
to
the
black
constituencies
it
has
been
so
construed
in
the
other
islands
and
was
the
occasion
of
the
agitation
in
trinidad
which
i
observed
when
i
was
there
my
own
opinion
as
to
the
wisdom
of
such
an
experiment
matters
little
but
i
have
a
right
to
say
that
neither
blacks
nor
whites
have
asked
for
it
that
no
one
who
knows
anything
of
the
west
indies
and
wishes
them
to
remain
english
sincerely
asked
for
it
that
no
one
has
agitated
for
it
save
a
few
newspaper
writers
and
politicians
whom
it
would
raise
into
consequence
if
tried
at
all
it
will
be
tried
either
with
a
deliberate
intention
of
cutting
jamaica
free
from
us
altogether
or
else
in
deference
to
english
political
superstitions
which
attribute
supernatural
virtues
to
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
and
assume
that
a
form
of
which
suits
us
tolerably
at
home
will
be
equally
beneficial
in
all
countries
and
under
all
conditions
footnotes
this
has
been
angrily
denied
a
gentleman

i
can

i

i
write
of
an
adventure
which
befell
archbishop
whately
soon
after
his
promotion
to
the
see
of
dublin
on
arriving
in
ireland
he
saw
that
the
people
were
miserable
the
cause
in
his
mind
was
their
ignorance
of
political
economy
of
which
he
had
himself
written
what
he
regarded
as
an
excellent
manual
an
irish
translation
of
this
manual
he
conceived
would
be
the
best
possible
medicine
and
he
commissioned
a
native
scripture
reader
to
make
one
to
insure
correctness
he
required
the
reader
to
retranslate
to
him
what
he
had
written
line
by
line
he
observed
that
the
man
as
he
read
turned
sometimes
two
pages
at
a
time
the
text
went
on
correctly
but
his
quick
eye
perceived
that
something
was
written
on
the
intervening
leaves
he
insisted
on
knowing
what
it
was
and
at
last
extorted
an
explanation
grace
me
and
my
comrade
conceived
that
it
was
mighty
dry
reading
so
we
have
just
interposed
now
and
then
a
bit
of
a
pawem
to
help
it
forward
your
grace
i
am
myself
imitating
the
translators
and
making
sandwiches
out
of
politics
and
local
descriptions
we
had
brought
the
english
mails
with
us
there
were
letters
to
read
which
had
been
in
the
ship
with
us
though
out
of
our
reach
there
were
the
newspapers
to
read
they
told
me
nothing
but
the
weary
round
of
irish
outrages
and
the
rival
remedies
of
tory
or
radical
politicians
who
cared
for
ireland
less
than
i
did
and
considered
only
how
to
trim
their
sails
to
keep
in
office
or
to
get
it
how
sick
one
is
of
all
that
times
at
least
in
history
things
have
come
to
the
same
point
ireland
can
not
govern
the
earl
of
kildare
said
someone
in
henry
viii
privy
council
then
answered
wolsey
in
the
tone
of
gladstone
the
earl
of
kildare
govern
all
ireland
elizabeth
wished
to
conciliate
shan
desmond
tyrone
promised
in
turn
to
rule
ireland
in
loyal
union
with
england
under
irish
ideas
lord
grey
who
was
for
mahometan
conquest
was
censured
and
at
yet
the
end
was
always
broken
heads
from
to
an
irish
parliament
sat
at
kilkenny
and
charles
and
the
tories
dreamt
of
an
alliance
between
irish
popery
and
english
loyalism
charles
lost
his
head
and
cromwell
had
to
make
an
end
of
irish
at
drogheda
and
wexford
tyrconnell
and
james
ii
were
to
repeal
the
act
of
settlement
and
restore
the
forfeited
lands
to
the
old
owners
the
end
of
that
came
at
the
boyne
and
at
aghrim
grattan
would
remake
the
irish
nation
the
english
liberals
sent
lord
fitzwilliam
to
help
him
and
the
saxon
mastiff
and
the
celtic
wolf
were
to
live
as
brothers
evermore
the
result
has
been
always
the
same
the
wretched
country
inflated
with
a
dream
of
independence
and
then
trampled
into
mud
again
so
it
has
been
so
it
will
be
again
ireland
can
not
be
independent
for
england
is
stronger
than
she
and
can
not
permit
it
yet
nothing
less
will
satisfy
her
and
so
there
has
been
always
a
weary
round
of
fruitless
concessions
leading
to
demands
which
can
not
be
gratified
and
in
the
end
we
are
driven
back
upon
force
which
the
miserable
people
lack
the
courage
to
encounter
like
men
gladstone
experiment
differs
only
from
its
antecedents
because
in
the
past
the
english
friends
of
irish
liberty
had
a
real
hope
that
a
reconciliation
was
possible
they
believed
in
what
they
were
trying
to
do
the
present
enterprise
is
the
creation
of
parliamentary
faction
i
have
never
met
any
person
acquainted
with
the
minds
and
motives
of
the
public
men
of
the
day
who
would
not
confess
to
me
that
if
it
had
suited
the
interests
of
the
leaders
of
the
present
radical
party
to
adopt
the
irish
policy
of
the
long
parliament
their
energy
and
their
eloquence
would
have
been
equally
at
the
service
of
the
protestant
ascendency
which
they
have
now
denounced
as
a
upas
tree
they
even
ask
you
with
wide
eyes
what
else
you
would
expect
sexton
says
that
if
england
means
to
govern
ireland
she
must
keep
an
army
there
as
large
as
she
keeps
in
india
england
could
govern
ireland
in
perfect
peace
without
an
army
at
all
if
there
was
no
faction
in
the
house
of
commons
the
spirit
of
party
will
either
destroy
the
british
empire
or
the
british
nation
will
make
an
end
of
party
government
on
its
present
lines
there
are
sounds
in
the
air
like
the
cracking
of
the
ice
of
the
neva
at
the
incoming
of
spring
as
if
a
nobler
purpose
was
at
last
awaking
in
us
in
a
few
more
years
there
may
be
no
more
radicals
and
no
more
conservatives
and
the
nation
will
be
all
in
all
here
is
the
answer
to
the
question
so
often
asked
what
is
the
use
of
the
colonies
to
us
the
colonies
are
a
hundredfold
multiplication
of
the
area
of
our
own
limited
islands
in
taking
possession
of
so
large
a
portion
of
the
globe
we
have
enabled
ourselves
to
spread
and
increase
and
carry
our
persons
our
language
and
our
liberties
into
all
climates
and
continents
we
overflow
at
home
there
are
too
many
of
us
here
already
and
if
no
lands
belonged
to
us
but
great
britain
and
ireland
we
should
become
a
small
insignificant
power
beside
the
mighty
nations
which
are
forming
around
us
there
is
space
for
hundreds
of
millions
of
us
in
the
territories
of
which
we
and
our
fathers
have
possessed
ourselves
in
canada
australia
new
zealand
we
add
to
our
numbers
and
our
resources
there
are
so
many
more
englishmen
in
the
world
able
to
hold
their
own
against
the
mightiest
of
their
rivals
and
we
have
another
function
such
as
the
romans
had
the
sections
of
men
on
this
globe
are
unequally
gifted
some
are
strong
and
can
govern
themselves
some
are
weak
and
are
the
prey
of
foreign
invaders
or
internal
anarchy
and
freedom
which
all
desire
is
only
attainable
by
weak
nations
when
they
are
subject
to
the
rule
of
others
who
are
at
once
powerful
and
just
this
was
the
duty
which
fell
to
the
latin
race
two
thousand
years
ago
in
these
modern
times
it
has
fallen
to
ours
and
in
the
discharge
of
it
the
highest
features
in
the
english
character
have
displayed
themselves
circumstances
forced
on
us
the
conquest
of
india
we
have
given
india
in
return
internal
peace
undisturbed
by
tribal
quarrels
or
the
ambitions
of
dangerous
neighbours
with
a
law
which
deals
out
right
to
high
and
low
among
human
beings
never
have
rulers
been
less
than
we
have
been
in
our
asiatic
empire
no
de
repetundis
has
been
needed
to
punish
avaricious
proconsuls
who
had
fattened
on
the
provinces
in
such
positions
the
english
show
at
their
best
and
do
their
best
india
has
been
the
training
school
of
our
greatest
soldiers
and
greatest
administrators
strike
off
the
names
from
the
roll
of
famous
englishmen
and
we
shall
lose
the
most
illustrious
of
them
all
in
india
the
rule
of
england
has
been
an
unexampled
success
glorious
to
ourselves
and
of
infinite
benefit
to
our
subjects
because
we
have
been
upright
and
disinterested
and
have
tried
sincerely
and
honourably
to
do
our
duty
in
other
countries
belonging
to
us
where
with
the
same
methods
we
might
have
produced
the
same
results
we
have
applied
them
with
a
hesitating
and
less
clean
hand
we
planted
ireland
as
a
colony
with
our
own
people
we
gave
them
a
parliament
of
their
own
and
set
them
to
govern
the
native
irish
for
us
instead
of
doing
it
ourselves
to
save
appearances
and
to
save
trouble
we
have
not
failed
altogether
all
the
good
that
has
been
done
at
all
in
that
poor
island
has
been
done
by
the
landlords
but
it
has
not
been
much
as
the
present
condition
of
things
shows
in
the
west
indies
similarly
the
first
settlers
carried
with
them
their
english
institutions
they
were
themselves
a
handful
the
bulk
of
the
population
were
slaves
and
as
long
as
slavery
continued
those
institutions
continued
to
work
tolerably
in
the
interest
of
the
white
race
when
the
slaves
were
emancipated
the
distinction
of
colour
done
away
with
and
the
black
multitude
and
their
white
employers
made
equal
before
the
law
and
equally
privileged
constitutional
government
became
no
longer
adapted
to
the
new
conditions
the
white
minority
could
not
be
trusted
with
the
exclusive
possession
of
political
power
the
blacks
could
not
be
trusted
with
the
equally
dangerous
supremacy
which
their
numbers
would
insure
them
our
duty
if
we
did
not
and
do
not
mean
to
abandon
them
altogether
has
been
to
govern
both
with
the
same
equity
with
which
we
govern
at
calcutta
if
you
choose
to
take
a
race
like
the
irish
or
like
the
negroes
whom
you
have
forced
into
an
unwilling
subjection
and
have
not
treated
when
in
that
condition
with
perfect
justice
if
you
take
such
a
race
strike
the
fetters
off
them
and
arm
them
at
once
with
all
the
powers
and
privileges
of
loyal
citizens
you
ought
not
to
be
surprised
if
they
attribute
your
concessions
to
fear
and
if
they
turn
again
and
rend
you
when
we
are
brought
in
contact
with
races
of
men
who
are
not
strong
enough
or
brave
enough
to
defend
their
own
independence
and
whom
our
own
safety
can
not
allow
to
fall
under
any
other
power
our
right
and
our
duty
is
to
govern
such
races
and
to
govern
them
well
or
they
will
have
a
right
in
turn
to
cut
our
throats
this
is
our
mission
when
we
have
dared
to
act
up
to
it
we
have
succeeded
magnificently
we
have
failed
when
we
have
paltered
and
trifled
and
we
shall
fail
again
and
the
great
empire
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
will
be
shattered
to
atoms
if
we
refuse
to
look
facts
in
the
face
from
these
meditations
suggested
by
the
batch
of
newspapers
which
i
had
been
studying
i
was
roused
by
the
arrival
of
the
promised
a
and
young
officer
in
white
uniform
they
all
wear
white
in
the
tropics
who
had
brought
the
governor
carriage
for
me
government
house
or
king
house
as
it
is
called
answering
to
a
house
in
barbadoes
is
five
miles
from
kingston
on
the
slope
which
gradually
ascends
from
the
sea
to
the
mountains
we
drove
through
the
town
which
did
not
improve
on
closer
acquaintance
the
houses
which
front
towards
the
streets
are
generally
insignificant
the
better
sort
being
behind
walls
or
overhung
with
trees
were
imperfectly
visible
the
roads
were
deep
in
white
dust
which
flies
everywhere
in
whirling
clouds
from
the
unceasing
wind
it
was
the
dry
season
the
rains
are
not
constant
in
jamaica
as
they
are
in
the
antilles
the
fields
and
the
sides
of
the
mountains
were
bare
and
brown
and
parched
the
blacks
however
were
about
in
crowds
in
their
sunday
finery
being
in
a
british
island
we
had
got
back
into
the
white
calicoes
and
ostrich
plumes
and
i
missed
the
grace
of
the
women
at
dominica
but
men
and
women
seemed
as
if
they
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
we
passed
up
park
camp
and
the
cantonments
of
the
west
india
regiments
and
then
through
a
of
dwarf
acacia
and
blue
flowered
lignum
vitae
handsome
villas
were
spread
along
the
road
with
lawns
and
gardens
and
the
road
itself
was
as
excellent
as
those
in
barbadoes
half
an
hour
drive
brought
us
to
the
lodge
and
through
the
park
to
the
king
house
itself
which
stands
among
groups
of
fine
trees
four
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
all
the
large
houses
in
jamaica
and
this
was
one
of
the
largest
of
them
are
like
those
in
barbadoes
with
the
type
more
completely
developed
generally
square
built
of
stone
standing
on
blocks
hollow
underneath
for
circulation
of
air
and
approached
by
a
broad
flight
of
steps
on
the
three
sides
which
the
sun
touches
deep
verandahs
or
balconies
are
thrown
out
on
the
first
and
second
floors
closed
in
front
by
green
blinds
which
can
be
shut
either
completely
or
partially
so
that
at
a
distance
they
look
like
houses
of
cards
or
great
green
boxes
made
pretty
by
the
trees
which
shelter
them
or
the
creepers
which
climb
over
them
behind
the
blinds
run
long
airy
darkened
galleries
and
into
these
the
sitting
rooms
open
which
are
of
course
still
darker
with
a
subdued
green
light
in
which
till
you
are
used
to
it
you
can
hardly
read
the
floors
are
black
smooth
and
polished
with
loose
mats
for
carpets
the
reader
of
cringle
will
remember
tom
misadventure
when
he
blundered
into
a
party
of
pretty
laughing
girls
slipped
on
one
of
these
floors
with
a
retrospective
misadventure
and
could
not
rise
till
his
creole
cousin
slipped
a
petticoat
over
his
head
all
the
arrangements
are
made
to
shut
out
heat
and
light
the
galleries
have
sofas
to
lounge
upon
everybody
smokes
and
smokes
where
he
pleases
the
draught
sweeping
away
all
residuary
traces
at
the
king
house
to
increase
the
accommodation
a
large
separate
dining
saloon
has
been
thrown
out
on
the
north
side
to
which
you
descend
from
the
drawing
room
by
stairs
and
thence
along
a
covered
passage
among
the
mango
trees
behind
there
is
a
separate
suite
of
rooms
for
the
aides
and
a
superb
swimming
bath
sixty
feet
long
and
eight
feet
deep
altogether
it
was
a
sumptuous
sort
of
palace
where
a
governor
with
a
year
might
spend
his
term
of
office
with
considerable
comfort
were
it
not
haunted
by
recollections
of
poor
eyre
he
it
seems
lived
in
the
house
and
two
miles
off
within
sight
of
his
windows
lived
gordon
i
had
a
more
than
gracious
welcome
from
colonel
j
and
his
family
in
him
i
found
a
soldier
who
had
served
with
distinction
in
india
who
had
been
at
the
storm
of
delhi
and
who
was
close
by
when
nicholson
was
shot
no
one
could
have
looked
fitter
for
the
post
which
he
now
temporarily
occupied
i
felt
uncomfortable
at
being
thus
thrust
upon
his
hospitality
i
had
letters
of
introduction
with
me
to
the
various
governors
of
the
islands
but
on
colonel
j
i
had
no
claim
at
all
i
was
not
even
aware
of
his
existence
or
he
very
likely
of
mine
if
not
he
at
any
rate
the
ladies
of
his
establishment
might
reasonably
look
upon
me
as
a
bore
and
if
i
had
been
allowed
i
should
simply
have
paid
my
respects
and
have
gone
on
to
my
mulatto
but
they
would
not
hear
of
it
they
were
so
evidently
hearty
in
their
invitation
to
me
that
i
could
only
submit
and
do
my
best
to
be
a
bore
the
one
sin
for
which
there
is
no
forgiveness
in
the
circle
into
which
i
was
thrown
i
was
unlikely
to
hear
much
of
west
indian
politics
or
problems
colonel
j
was
acting
as
governor
by
accident
and
for
a
few
months
only
he
had
his
professional
duties
to
look
after
his
term
of
service
in
jamaica
had
nearly
expired
and
he
could
not
trouble
himself
with
possibilities
and
tendencies
with
which
he
would
have
no
personal
concern
as
a
spectator
he
considered
probably
that
we
were
not
making
much
of
the
west
indies
and
were
not
on
the
way
to
make
much
he
confirmed
the
complaint
which
i
had
heard
so
often
that
the
blacks
would
not
work
for
wages
more
than
three
days
in
the
week
or
regularly
upon
those
preferring
to
cultivate
their
own
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
but
as
it
was
admitted
that
they
did
work
one
way
or
another
at
home
i
could
not
see
that
there
was
much
to
complain
of
the
blacks
were
only
doing
as
we
do
we
too
only
work
as
much
as
we
like
or
as
we
must
and
we
prefer
working
for
ourselves
to
working
for
others
on
his
special
subjects
the
colonel
was
as
interesting
as
he
could
not
help
being
he
talked
of
the
army
and
of
the
recent
changes
in
it
without
insisting
that
it
was
going
to
the
devil
he
talked
of
india
and
the
russians
and
for
a
wonder
he
had
no
russophobia
he
thought
that
england
and
russia
might
as
easily
be
friends
as
enemies
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
world
if
they
were
as
this
had
been
my
own
fixed
opinion
for
the
last
thirty
years
i
thought
him
a
very
sensible
man
in
the
evening
there
was
a
small
dinner
party
made
up
chiefly
of
officers
from
the
west
indian
regiments
at
kingston
the
english
troops
are
in
the
mountains
at
newcastle
four
or
five
thousand
feet
up
and
beyond
common
visiting
distance
among
those
whom
i
met
on
this
occasion
was
an
officer
who
struck
me
particularly
there
was
a
mystery
about
his
origin
he
had
risen
from
the
ranks
but
was
evidently
a
gentleman
by
birth
he
had
seen
service
all
over
the
world
he
had
been
in
chili
and
among
his
other
accomplishments
spoke
spanish
fluently
he
entered
the
english
army
as
a
private
had
been
in
the
war
in
the
transvaal
and
was
the
only
survivor
of
the
regiment
which
was
surprised
and
shot
down
by
the
boers
in
an
intricate
pass
where
they
could
neither
retreat
nor
defend
themselves
on
that
occasion
he
had
escaped
and
saved
the
colours
for
which
he
was
rewarded
by
a
commission
he
was
acquainted
with
many
of
my
friends
there
who
had
been
in
the
thick
of
the
campaign
knew
sir
owen
lanyon
sir
morrison
barlow
and
colley
he
had
surveyed
the
plateau
on
majuba
hill
after
the
action
and
had
gathered
the
rumours
which
were
flying
many
coloured
about
colley
death
friend
and
foe
alike
loved
colley
and
his
already
legendary
fame
is
an
unconscious
tribute
to
his
memory
by
whose
hand
he
fell
can
never
be
known
we
believe
as
we
wish
or
as
we
fancy
was
so
fine
an
officer
so
clever
a
man
and
so
reserved
about
his
personal
affairs
that
about
him
too
were
growing
he
was
credited
in
the
mess
room
with
being
the
then
unknown
author
of
mines
haggard
will
forgive
a
mistake
which
if
he
knows
he
will
feel
to
be
a
compliment
from
general
conversation
i
gathered
that
the
sanguine
views
of
the
colonial
secretary
were
not
widely
shared
the
english
interest
was
still
something
in
jamaica
but
the
phenomena
of
the
antilles
were
present
there
also
if
in
a
less
extreme
form
there
were
coloured
people
in
the
island
with
but
or
whites
and
the
blacks
there
also
were
increasing
rapidly
and
the
whites
were
stationary
if
not
declining
there
was
the
same
uneasy
social
jealousy
and
the
absence
of
any
social
relation
between
the
two
races
there
were
mulattoes
in
the
island
of
wealth
and
consequence
and
at
government
house
there
are
no
distinctions
but
the
english
residents
of
pure
colonial
blood
would
not
associate
with
them
social
exclusiveness
increasing
with
political
equality
the
blacks
disliked
the
mulattoes
the
mulattoes
despised
the
blacks
and
would
not
intermarry
with
them
the
impression
was
that
the
mulatto
would
die
out
that
the
tendency
of
the
whites
and
blacks
was
to
a
constantly
sharpening
separation
and
that
if
things
went
on
as
they
were
going
for
another
generation
it
was
easy
to
see
which
of
the
two
colours
would
then
be
in
the
ascendant
the
blacks
were
growing
saucy
too
with
much
else
of
the
same
kind
i
could
but
listen
and
wait
to
judge
for
myself
meanwhile
my
quarters
were
unexceptionable
my
kind
entertainers
leaving
nothing
undone
to
make
my
stay
with
them
agreeable
in
hot
climates
one
sleeps
lightly
but
light
sleep
is
all
that
one
wants
and
one
wakes
early
the
swimming
bath
was
waiting
for
me
underneath
my
window
after
a
plunge
in
the
clear
cold
water
came
coffee
grown
and
dried
and
roasted
on
the
spot
and
as
such
coffee
ought
to
be
then
came
the
early
walk
one
missed
the
tropical
luxuriance
of
trinidad
and
dominica
for
the
winter
months
in
jamaica
are
almost
rainless
but
it
would
have
been
beautiful
anywhere
else
and
the
mango
trees
were
in
their
glory
there
was
a
corner
given
to
orchids
which
were
hung
in
baskets
and
just
coming
into
flower
lizards
swarmed
in
the
sunshine
running
up
the
tree
trunks
or
basking
on
the
garden
seats
snakes
there
are
none
the
mongoose
has
cleared
them
all
away
so
completely
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
him
to
eat
but
the
poultry
in
which
he
makes
havoc
and
having
been
introduced
to
exterminate
the
vermin
has
become
a
vermin
himself
to
drive
to
ride
to
visit
was
the
employment
of
the
days
i
saw
the
country
i
saw
what
people
were
doing
and
heard
what
they
had
to
say
the
details
are
mostly
only
worth
forgetting
the
senior
captain
c
an
officer
in
the
artillery
was
a
man
of
ability
and
observation
he
too
like
the
colonel
was
mainly
interested
in
his
profession
to
which
he
was
anxious
to
return
but
he
was
watching
too
with
serious
interest
the
waning
fortunes
of
the
west
indies
he
superintended
the
social
part
of
the
governor
business
to
perfection
anything
which
i
wished
for
had
only
to
be
mentioned
to
be
provided
he
gave
me
the
benefit
though
less
often
than
i
could
have
wished
of
his
shrewd
and
not
ungenial
observations
he
drove
me
one
morning
into
kingston
i
had
passed
through
it
hastily
on
the
day
of
my
landing
there
were
libraries
museums
public
offices
and
such
like
to
be
seen
besides
the
town
itself
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
more
often
in
the
clouds
than
out
of
them
the
cantonments
of
the
english
regiments
were
visible
from
the
park
at
government
house
the
slope
where
they
had
been
placed
was
so
steep
that
one
wondered
how
they
held
on
they
looked
like
tablecloths
stretched
out
to
dry
i
was
to
ride
up
there
one
day
meanwhile
as
we
were
driving
through
the
park
and
saw
the
white
spots
shining
up
above
us
i
asked
the
what
the
privates
found
to
do
in
such
a
place
the
ground
was
too
steep
for
athletics
no
cricket
could
be
possible
there
no
lawn
tennis
no
quoits
no
anything
there
were
no
neighbours
sports
there
were
none
the
mongoose
had
destroyed
the
winged
game
and
there
was
neither
hare
nor
rabbit
pig
nor
deer
not
a
wild
animal
to
be
hunted
and
killed
with
nothing
to
do
no
one
to
speak
to
and
nothing
to
kill
what
could
become
of
them
did
they
drink
well
yes
they
drank
rum
occasionally
but
there
were
no
public
houses
they
could
only
get
it
at
the
canteen
and
the
daily
allowance
was
moderate
as
to
beer
it
was
out
of
reach
altogether
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
it
was
double
the
price
which
it
was
in
england
at
newcastle
the
price
was
doubled
again
by
the
cost
of
carriage
to
the
camp
i
inquired
if
they
did
not
occasionally
hang
themselves
they
would
he
said
they
had
no
choice
but
they
preferred
to
desert
and
this
they
did
in
large
numbers
they
slipped
down
the
back
of
the
range
made
their
way
to
the
sea
and
escaped
to
the
united
states
the
officers
what
became
of
them
the
officers
oh
well
they
gardened
did
they
like
it
some
did
and
some
did
they
were
not
so
ill
off
as
the
men
as
occasionally
they
could
come
down
on
leave
one
wondered
what
the
process
had
been
which
had
led
the
authorities
to
select
such
a
situation
of
course
it
was
for
the
health
of
the
troops
but
the
hill
country
in
jamaica
is
wide
there
were
many
other
places
available
less
utterly
detestable
and
ennui
and
discontent
are
as
mischievous
as
fever
general
a
short
time
ago
went
up
to
hold
an
inquiry
into
the
desertions
and
expressed
his
wonder
how
such
things
could
be
with
such
air
such
scenery
such
views
far
and
wide
over
the
island
what
could
human
creatures
wish
for
more
would
desert
yourself
general
said
another

you
were
obliged
to
stay
there
a
month
captain
c
undertook
that
i
should
go
up
myself
in
a
day
or
two
he
promised
to
write
and
make
arrangements
meanwhile
we
went
on
to
kingston
it
was
not
beautiful
there
was
rodney
statue
rodney
is
venerated
in
jamaica
as
he
ought
to
be
but
for
him
it
would
have
been
a
spanish
colony
again
but
there
is
nothing
grand
about
the
buildings
nothing
even
handsome
nothing
even
specially
characteristic
of
england
or
the
english
mind
they
were
once
perhaps
and
business
having
slackened
they
are
now
dingy
shops
houses
wharves
want
brightness
and
colour
we
called
at
the
office
of
the
colonial
secretary
the
central
point
of
the
administration
it
was
an
old
mansion
plain
unambitious
sufficient
perhaps
for
its
purpose
but
lifeless
and
dark
if
it
represented
economy
there
would
be
no
objection
the
public
debt
has
doubled
since
jamaica
became
a
crown
colony
in
it
was
half
a
million
it
is
now
more
than
a
million
and
a
half
the
explanation
is
the
extension
of
the
railway
system
and
there
has
been
no
culpable
extravagance
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
of
a
constitution
would
mend
matters
democracies
are
always
extravagant
the
majority
who
have
little
property
or
none
regulate
the
expenditure
they
lay
the
taxes
on
the
minority
who
have
to
find
the
money
and
have
no
interest
in
sparing
them
ireland
when
it
was
governed
by
the
landowners
jamaica
in
the
days
of
slavery
were
administered
at
a
cost
which
seems
now
incredibly
small
the
authority
of
the
landowners
and
of
the
planters
was
undisputed
they
were
feared
and
obeyed
and
magistrates
unpaid
and
local
constables
sufficed
to
maintain
tolerable
order
their
authority
is
gone
their
functions
are
transferred
to
the
police
and
every
service
has
to
be
paid
for
there
may
be
fewer
serious
crimes
but
the
subordination
is
immeasurably
less
the
expense
of
administration
is
immeasurably
greater
i
declined
to
be
taken
over
sugar
mills
or
to
be
shown
the
latest
improvements
i
was
too
ignorant
to
understand
in
what
the
improvements
consisted
and
could
take
them
upon
trust
the
public
bakery
was
more
interesting
in
tropical
climates
a
hot
oven
in
a
small
house
makes
an
inconvenient
addition
to
the
temperature
the
bread
for
kingston
and
for
many
miles
around
it
is
manufactured
at
night
by
a
single
company
and
is
distributed
in
carts
in
the
morning
we
saw
the
museum
and
public
library
there
were
the
usual
specimens
of
island
antiquities
of
local
fish
birds
insects
reptiles
plants
geological
formations
and
such
like
in
the
library
were
old
editions
of
curious
books
at
the
west
indies
some
of
them
unique
ready
to
yield
ampler
pictures
of
the
romance
of
the
old
life
there
than
we
at
present
possess
i
had
but
leisure
to
glance
at
and
engravings
the
most
noticeable
relic
preserved
there
if
it
be
only
genuine
is
the
identical
bauble
which
cromwell
ordered
to
be
taken
away
from
the
speaker
table
in
the
house
of
commons
explanations
are
given
of
the
manner
in
which
it
came
to
jamaica
the
evidence
so
far
as
i
could
understand
it
did
not
appear
conclusive
among
the
new
industries
in
the
island
in
the
place
of
sugar
was
or
ought
to
be
tobacco
a
few
years
ago
i
asked
sir
hooker
the
chief
living
authority
in
such
matters
why
cuba
was
allowed
the
monopoly
of
delicate
cigar
tobacco
whether
there
were
no
other
countries
where
it
could
be
grown
equally
good
he
said
that
at
the
very
moment
cigars
as
fine
as
the
finest
havanas
were
being
produced
in
jamaica
he
gave
me
an
excellent
specimen
with
the
address
of
the
house
which
supplied
it
and
for
a
year
or
two
i
was
able
to
buy
from
it
what
if
not
perfect
was
more
than
tolerable
the
house
acquired
a
reputation
and
then
for
some
reason
or
other
perhaps
from
weariness
of
the
same
flavour
perhaps
from
a
falling
off
in
the
character
of
the
cigars
i
and
possibly
others
began
to
be
less
satisfied
here
on
the
spot
i
wished
to
make
another
experiment
captain
c
introduced
me
to
a
famous
manufacturer
a
spaniard
with
a
spanish
manager
under
him
who
had
been
trained
at
havana
i
bespoke
his
good
will
by
adjuring
him
in
his
own
tongue
not
to
disappoint
me
and
i
believe
that
he
gave
me
the
best
that
he
had
but
alas
it
is
with
tobacco
as
with
most
other
things
democracy
is
king
and
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
is
the
rule
of
modern
life
the
average
of
everything
is
higher
than
it
used
to
be
the
high
quality
which
rises
above
mediocrity
is
rare
or
is
we
are
swept
away
by
the
genius
of
the
age
and
must
be
content
with
such
other
blessings
as
it
has
been
pleased
to
bring
with
it
why
should
i
murmur
thus
and
vainly
moan
the
gods
will
have
it
so
their
will
be
done
the
earth
is
patient
also
and
allows
the
successive
generations
of
human
creatures
to
play
their
parts
upon
her
surface
as
they
please
she
spins
on
upon
her
own
course
and
seas
and

and

beautiful

ever
gordon
town
is
a
straggling
village
in
the
blue
range
underneath
newcastle
colonel
j
had
a
villa
there
and
one
afternoon
he
took
me
over
to
see
it
you
pass
abruptly
from
the
open
country
into
the
mountains
the
way
to
gordon
town
was
by
the
side
of
the
hope
river
which
cuts
its
way
out
of
them
in
a
narrow
deep
ravine
the
stream
was
now
trickling
faintly
among
the
stones
the
enormous
boulders
in
the
bed
were
round
as
cannon
balls
and
weighing
hundreds
of
tons
show
what
its
power
must
be
in
the
coming
down
of
the
floods
within
the
limits
of
the
torrent
which
must
rise
at
such
times
thirty
feet
above
its
winter
level
the
rocks
were
bare
and
stern
no
green
thing
being
able
to
grow
there
above
the
line
the
tropical
vegetation
was
in
all
its
glory
ferns
and
plantains
waving
in
the
moist
air
cedars
tamarinds
gum
trees
orange
trees
striking
their
roots
among
the
clefts
of
the
crags
and
hanging
out
over
the
abysses
below
them
aloes
flung
up
their
tall
spiral
stems
flowering
shrubs
and
creepers
covered
bank
and
slope
with
green
and
blue
and
white
and
yellow
and
above
and
over
our
heads
as
we
drove
along
frowned
the
great
limestone
blocks
which
thunder
down
when
loosened
by
the
rain
farther
up
the
hill
sides
where
the
slopes
are
less
precipitous
the
forest
has
been
burnt
off
by
the
unthrifty
blacks
who
use
fire
to
clear
the
ground
for
their
yam
gardens
and
destroy
the
timber
over
a
dozen
acres
when
they
intend
to
cultivate
but
a
single
one
the
landscape
suffers
less
than
the
soil
the
effect
to
the
eye
is
merely
that
the
mountains
in
jamaica
as
in
temperate
climates
become
bare
at
a
moderate
altitude
and
their
outlines
are
marked
more
sharply
against
the
sky
introduced
among
scenery
of
this
kind
we
followed
the
river
two
or
three
miles
when
it
was
crossed
by
a
bridge
above
which
stood
my
friend
miss
burton
lodging
house
where
she
had
designed
entertaining
me
at
gordon
town
which
is
again
a
mile
farther
on
the
valley
widens
out
and
there
are
cocoa
and
coffee
plantations
through
an
opening
we
saw
far
above
our
heads
like
specks
of
snow
against
the
mountain
side
the
homes
or
prisons
of
our
unfortunate
troops
overlooking
the
village
through
which
we
were
passing
and
three
hundred
feet
above
it
was
perched
the
colonel
villa
on
a
projecting
spur
where
a
tributary
of
the
hope
river
has
carved
out
a
second
ravine
we
drove
to
the
door
up
a
steep
winding
lane
among
coffee
bushes
which
scented
the
air
with
their
blossom
and
wild
oranges
on
which
the
fruit
hung
untouched
glowing
like
balls
of
gold
we
were
now
eleven
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
the
air
was
already
many
degrees
cooler
than
at
kingston
the
ground
in
front
of
the
house
was
levelled
for
a
garden
ivy
was
growing
about
the
trellis
work
and
scarlet
geraniums
and
sweet
violets
and
roses
which
can
not
be
cultivated
in
the
lower
regions
were
here
in
full
bloom
elsewhere
in
the
grounds
there
was
a
lawn
tennis
court
to
tempt
the
officers
down
from
their
eyrie
in
the
clouds
the
house
was
empty
in
charge
of
servants
from
the
balcony
in
front
of
the
drawing
room
we
saw
peak
rising
behind
peak
till
the
highest
four
thousand
feet
above
us
was
lost
in
the
white
mist
below
was
the
valley
of
the
hope
river
with
its
gardens
and
trees
and
scattered
huts
with
buildings
here
and
there
of
higher
pretensions
on
the
other
side
the
tributary
stream
rushed
down
its
own
ravine

among
the

prosperity
what
would
become
of

all
if
jamaica
drifted
after
her
sisters
in
the
antilles
as
some
persons
thought
that
she
was
drifting
and
became
like
grenada
an
island
of

proprietors
was
such
a
fate
really
hanging
over
her
not
necessarily
not
by
any
law

if
it
came
it
would
come
from
the
dispiritment
the
lack
of
energy
and
hope
in
the
languid
representatives
of
the
english
colonists
for
the
land
even
in
the
mountains
will
grow
what
it
is
asked
to
grow
and
men
do
not
live
by
sugar
alone
and
my
friend
nicholl
in
dominica
and
colonel
duncan
in
grenada
itself
were
showing
what
english
energy
could
do
if
it
was
alive

vigorous
the

of

if
they
could
not
be
of
the
same
race
as
the
men
who
ruled
in
the
days
of
the
slave
trade
the
question
to
be
asked
in
every
colony
is
what
sort
of
men
is
it
rearing
if
that
can
not
be
answered
satisfactorily
the
rest
is
not
worth

with

what

of

went
that
half
of
it
had
been
swallowed
up
by
an
earthquake
we
ran
out
in
a
steam
launch
from
kingston
passing
under
the
sterns
of
the
spanish
frigates
i
was
told
that
there
were
always
one
or
more
spanish
ships
of
war
stationed
there
but
no
one
knew
anything
about
them
except
generally
that
they
were
on

for

there
was
no
exchange
of

and
ours
nor
even
official
communication
beyond
what
was
formally
necessary
i
thought
it
strange
but
it
was
no
business
of
mine
my
surprise
however
was
admitted
to
be
natural
as
the
launch
drew
little
water
we
had
no
occasion
to
follow
the
circuitous
channel
but
went
straight
over
the
shoals
we
passed
close
by
gallows
point
where
the
johnny
crows
used
to
pick
the
pirates
bones
in
the
mangrove
swamp
adjoining
it
was
said
that
there
was
an
old
spanish
cemetery
but
the
swamp
was
poisonous
and
no
one
had
ever
seen
it
at
the
dockyard
pier
the
commodore
was
waiting
for
us
i
found
that
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
whom
i
had
met
ten
years
before
at
the
cape
he
was
a
brisk
smart
officer
quiet
and
in
his
manners
but
with
plenty
of
talent
and
cultivation
he
showed
us
his
stores
and
his
machinery
large
engines
and
engineers
to
work
them
ready
for
any
work
which
might
be
wanted
but
apparently
with
none
to
do
we
went
over
the
hospital
airy
and
clean
with
scarcely
a
single
occupant
so
healthy
has
now
been
made
a
spot
which
was
once
a
nest
of
yellow
fever
naval
stores
soon
become
antiquated
and
parts
of
the
great
square
were
paved
with
the
old
cannon
balls
which
had
become
useless
on
the
introduction
of
rifled
guns
the
fortifications
were
antiquated
also
but
new
works
were
being
thrown
up
armed
with
the
modern
monster
cannon
one
difficulty
struck
me
port
royal
stood
upon
a
sandbank
in
such
a
place
no
spring
of
fresh
water
could
be
looked
for
on
the
large
acreage
of
roofs
there
were
no
shoots
to
catch
the
rain
and
carry
it
into
cisterns
whence
did
the
water
come
for
the
people
in
the
town
how
were
the
fleets
supplied
which
used
to
ride
there
how
was
it
in
the
old
times
when
port
royal
was
crowded
with
revelling
crews
of
buccaneers
i
found
that
every
drop
which
is
consumed
in
the
place
or
which
is
taken
on
board
either
of
merchant
ship
or
is
brought
in
a
steam
tug
from
a
spring
ten
miles
off
upon
the
coast
before
steam
came
in
it
was
fetched
in
barges
rowed
by
hand
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
save
the
rain
which
falls
in
abundance
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
lay
pipes
along
the
to
the
spring
but
the
tug
plies
daily
to
and
fro
and
no
one
thinks
more
about
the
matter
a
west
indian
regiment
is
stationed
at
port
royal
after
the
dockyard
we
went
through
the
soldiers
quarters
and
then
walked
through
the
streets
of
the
once
famous
station
it
is
now
a
mere
hamlet
of
boatmen
and
fishermen
squalid
and
wretched
without
and
within
children
stared
at
us
from
the
doors
with
their
dark
round
eyes
i
found
it
hard
to
call
up
the
scenes
of
riot
and
confusion
and
wild
excitement
which
are
alleged
to
have
been
witnessed
there
the
story
that
it
once
covered
a
far
larger
area
has
been
perhaps
invented
to
account
for
the
incongruity
old
plans
exist
which
seem
to
show
that
the
end
of
the
spit
could
never
have
been
of
any
larger
dimensions
than
it
is
at
present
there
is
proof
enough
however
that
in
the
sand
there
lie
the
remains
of
many
thousand
english
soldiers
and
seamen
who
ended
their
lives
there
for
one
cause
or
other
the
bones
lie
so
close
that
they
are
turned
up
as
in
a
country
churchyard
when
a
fresh
grave
is
dug
the
walls
of
the
old
church
are
inlaid
thickly
with
monuments
and
monumental
tablets
to
the
memory
of
officers
of
either
service
young
and
old
some
killed
by
fever
some
by
accidents
of
war
or
sea
some
decorated
with
the
honours
which
they
had
won
in
a
hundred
fights
some
carried
off
before
they
had
gathered
the
first
flower
of
fame
the
costliness
of
many
of
these
memorials
was
an
affecting
indication
how
precious
to
their
families
those
now
resting
there
once
had
been
one
in
high
relief
struck
me
as
a
characteristic
specimen
of
rubillac
workmanship
it
was
to
a
young
lieutenant
who
had
been
killed
by
the
bursting
of
a
gun
flame
and
vapour
were
rushing
out
of
the
breech
the
youth
himself
was
falling
backwards
with
his
arms
spread
out
and
a
vast
preternatural
face
death
judgment
eternity
or
whatever
it
was
meant
to
be
was
glaring
at
him
through
the
smoke
bad
art
though
the
execution
was
remarkable
but
better
perhaps
than
the
weeping
angels
now
grown
common
among
ourselves
after
luncheon
the
commodore
showed
us
his
curiosities
especially
his
garden
which
considering
the
state
of
his
water
supply
he
had
created
under
unfavourable
conditions
he
had
a
very
respectable
collection
of
tropical
ferns
and
flowers
with
palms
and
plantains
to
shade
and
shelter
them
he
was
an
artist
besides
within
the
lines
of
his
own
profession
drawings
of
ships
and
boats
of
all
sorts
and
in
all
attitudes
by
his
own
brush
or
pencil
were
hanging
on
the
walls
of
his
working
room
he
was
good
enough
to
ask
me
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
him
at
port
royal
before
i
left
the
island
and
i
looked
forward
with
special
pleasure
to
becoming
closer
acquainted
with
such
a
genuine
piece
of
british
oak
there
were
the
usual
ceremonies
to
be
attended
to
the
officers
of
the
guardship
and
gunboats
had
to
be
called
on
the
forts
constructed
or
in
the
course
of
construction
were
duly
inspected
i
believe
that
there
is
a
real
serious
intention
to
strengthen
port
royal
in
view
of
the
changes
which
may
come
about
through
the
opening
if
that
event
ever
takes
place
of
the
darien
canal
our
last
visit
was
to
a
fort
deserted
or
all
but
deserted
the
once
too
celebrated
fort
augusta
which
deserves
particular
description
it
stands
on
the
inner
side
of
the
lagoon
commanding
the
channel
at
the
point
of
the
great
mangrove
swamp
at
the
mouth
of
the
cobre
river
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
no
better
situation
could
have
been
chosen
had
there
been
nothing
else
to
be
considered
except
the
defence
of
the
harbour
for
a
vessel
trying
to
reach
kingston
had
to
pass
close
in
front
of
its
hundred
guns
it
was
constructed
on
a
scale
becoming
its
importance
with
accommodation
for
two
or
three
regiments
and
the
regiments
were
sent
thither
and
they
perished
regiment
after
regiment
officers
and
men
from
the
malarious
exhalations
of
the
morass
whole
battalions
were
swept
away
the
ranks
were
filled
up
by
reinforcements
from
home
and
these
too
went
the
same
road
of
one
regiment
the
only
survivors
according
to
the
traditions
of
the
place
were
a
quartermaster
and
a
corporal
finally
it
occurred
to
the
authorities
at
the
horse
guards
that
a
regiment
of
hussars
would
be
a
useful
addition
to
the
garrison
it
was
not
easy
to
see
what
hussars
were
to
do
there
there
is
not
a
spot
where
the
horses
could
stand
twenty
yards
beyond
the
lines
nor
could
they
reach
fort
augusta
at
all
except
in
barges
however
it
was
perhaps
well
that
they
were
sent
horses
and
men
went
the
way
of
the
rest
the
loss
of
the
men
might
have
been
supplied
but
horses
were
costly
and
the
loss
of
them
was
more
serious
fort
augusta
was
gradually
abandoned
and
is
now
used
only
as
a
powder
magazine
a
guard
is
kept
there
of
twenty
blacks
from
the
west
indian
force
but
even
these
are
changed
every
ten
days
so
deadly
the
vapour
of
that
malarious
jungle
is
now
understood
to
be
i
never
saw
so
spectral
a
scene
as
met
my
eyes
when
we
steamed
up
to
the
landing
place
ramparts
broken
down
and
dismantled
cannon
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
overgrown
by
jungle
the
sentinel
who
presented
arms
was
like
a
corpse
in
uniform
he
was
not
pale
for
he
was
a
negro
he
was
green
and
he
looked
like
some
ghoul
or
afrite
in
a
ghastly
cemetery
the
roofs
of
the
barracks
and
storehouses
had
fallen
in
the
rafters
being
left
standing
with
the
light
shining
between
them
as
through
the
bones
of
skeletons
great
piles
of
shot
lay
rusting
as
not
worth
removal
among
them
conical
shot
so
recently
had
this
fatal
charnel
house
been
regarded
as
a
fit
location
for
british
artillerymen
i
breathed
more
freely
as
we
turned
our
backs
upon
the
hideous
memorial
of
parliamentary
administration
and
steamed
away
into
a
purer
air
my
conservative
instincts
had
undergone
a
shock
as
we
look
back
into
the
past
the
brighter
features
stand
out
conspicuously
the
mistakes
and
miseries
have
sunk
in
the
shade
and
are
forgotten
in
the
present
faults
and
merits
are
visible
alike
the
faults
attract
chief
notice
that
they
may
be
mended
and
as
there
seem
so
many
of
them
the
impulse
is
to
conclude
that
the
past
was
better
it
is
well
to
be
sometimes
reminded
what
the
past
really
was
in
colonel
j
i
found
a
strong
advocate
of
the
late
army
reforms
thanks
to
recovering
energy
and
more
distinct
conscientiousness
thanks
to
the
eye
of
the
press
such
an
experiment
as
that
of
fort
augusta
could
hardly
be
tried
again
or
if
tried
could
not
be
persisted
in
extravagance
and
absurdities
however
remain
and
i
was
next
to
witness
an
instance
of
them
having
ceased
to
quarter
our
regiments
in
mangrove
swamps
we
now
build
a
camp
for
them
among
the
clouds
i
mentioned
that
captain
c
had
undertaken
that
i
should
see
newcastle
he
had
written
to
a
friend
there
to
say
that
i
was
coming
up
and
the
junior
kindly
lent
his
services
as
a
guide
as
far
as
gordon
town
we
drove
along
the
same
road
which
we
had
followed
before
there
at
a
small
wayside
inn
we
found
horses
waiting
which
were
accustomed
to
the
mountain
suspicious
mists
were
hanging
about
aloft
but
the
landlord
after
a
glance
at
them
promised
us
a
fine
day
and
we
mounted
and
set
off
my
merits
were
not
in
his
appearance
but
he
had
been
up
and
down
a
hundred
times
and
might
be
trusted
to
accomplish
his
hundred
and
first
without
misfortune
for
the
first
mile
or
so
the
road
was
tolerably
level
following
the
bank
of
the
river
under
the
shade
of
the
forest
it
then
narrowed
into
a
horse
path
and
zigzagged
upwards
at
the
side
of
a
torrent
into
the
deep
pools
of
which
we
occasionally
looked
down
over
the
edges
of
uncomfortable
precipices
then
again
there
was
a
level
with
a
village
and
coffee
plantations
and
oranges
and
bananas
after
this
the
vegetation
changed
we
issued
out
upon
open
mountain
with
english
grass
english
clover
english
gorse
and
other
familiar
acquaintances
introduced
to
make
the
isolation
less
intolerable
the
track
was
so
rough
and
narrow
that
we
could
ride
only
in
single
file
and
was
often
no
better
than
a
watercourse
yet
by
this
and
no
other
way
every
article
had
to
be
carried
on
donkeys
backs
or
human
heads
which
was
required
for
the
consumption
of
infantry
and
artillerymen
artillerymen
might
seem
to
imply
artillery
but
they
have
only
a
single
small
field
gun
they
are
there
for
health
sake
only
and
to
be
fit
for
work
if
wanted
below
an
hour
ride
brought
us
to
the
lowest
range
of
houses
which
were
feet
above
the
sea
from
thence
they
rose
tier
above
tier
for
feet
more
the
weather
so
far
had
held
up
and
the
views
had
been
glorious
but
we
passed
now
into
a
cloud
through
which
we
saw
dimly
groups
of
figures
listlessly
lounging
the
hillside
was
bare
and
the
slope
so
steep
that
there
was
no
standing
on
it
save
where
it
had
been
flattened
by
the
spade
and
here
in
this
extraordinary
place
were
young
englishmen
of
the
common
type
of
which
soldiers
are
made
with
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
enjoy
remaining
unless
they
desert
or
die
of
ennui
for
one
two
or
three
years
as
their
chance
may
be
every
other
day
they
can
see
nothing
save
each
other
forms
and
faces
in
the
fog
for
fine
and
bright
as
the
air
may
be
below
the
moisture
in
the
air
is
condensed
into
cloud
by
the
chill
rock
and
soil
of
the
high
ranges
the
officers
come
down
now
and
then
on
furlough
or
on
duty
the
men
rarely
and
hardly
at
all
and
soldiers
in
spite
of
general
can
not
always
be
made
happy
by
the
picturesque
they
are
not
educated
enough
to
find
employment
for
their
minds
and
of
amusement
there
is
none
we
continued
our
way
up
the
track
if
anything
growing
steeper
till
we
reached
the
highest
point
of
the
camp
and
found
ourselves
before
a
pretty
cottage
with
creepers
climbing
about
it
belonging
to
the
major
in
command
a
few
yards
off
was
the
officers
mess
room
they
expected
us
they
knew
my
companion
and
visitors
from
the
were
naturally
welcome
the
major
was
an
active
clever
man
with
a
bright
laughing
irish
wife
whose
relations
in
the
old
country
were
friends
of
my
own
the
american
consul
and
his
lady
happened
to
have
ridden
up
also
the
same
day
so
in
spite
of
fog
which
grew
thicker
every
moment
we
had
a
good
time
as
to
seeing
we
could
see
nothing
but
then
there
was
nothing
to
see
except
views
and
panoramic
views
from
mountain
tops
extolled
as
they
may
be
do
not
particularly
interest
me
the
officers
so
far
as
i
could
learn
are
less
ill
off
than
the
privates
those
who
are
married
have
their
wives
with
them
they
can
read
they
can
draw
they
can
ride
they
have
gardens
about
their
houses
where
they
can
grow
english
flowers
and
vegetables
and
try
experiments
science
can
be
followed
anywhere
and
is
everywhere
a
resource
major
told
me
that
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
find
the
day
too
long
healthy
the
camp
is
at
any
rate
the
temperature
never
rises
above
nor
sinks
often
below
they
require
charcoal
fires
to
keep
the
damp
out
and
blankets
to
sleep
under
and
when
they
see
the
sun
it
is
an
agreeable
change
and
something
to
talk
about
there
are
no
large
incidents
but
small
ones
do
instead
while
i
was
there
a
man
came
to
report
that
he
had
slipped
by
accident
and
set
a
stone
rolling
the
stone
had
cut
a
water
pipe
in
two
and
it
had
to
be
mended
and
was
an
afternoon
work
for
somebody
such
officers
as
have
no
resources
in
themselves
are
of
course
bored
to
extinction
there
is
neither
furred
game
to
hunt
nor
feathered
game
to
shoot
the
mongoose
has
eaten
up
the
partridges
i
suggested
that
they
should
import
two
or
three
couple
of
bears
from
norway
they
would
fatten
and
multiply
among
the
roots
and
sugar
canes
with
a
black
piccaninny
now
and
then
for
a
special
delicacy
one
of
the
party
extemporised
us
a
speech
which
would
be
made
on
the
occasion
in
exeter
hall
we
had
not
seen
the
worst
of
the
weather
as
we
mounted
to
ride
back
the
fog
changed
to
rain
and
the
rain
to
a
deluge
the
track
became
a
torrent
macintoshes
were
a
vanity
for
the
water
rushed
down
neck
and
every
crease
made
itself
into
a
conduit
carrying
the
stream
among
one
inner
garments
dominica
itself
had
not
prepared
me
for
the
violence
of
these
jamaican
downpourings
false
had
proved
our
prophet
down
below
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
go
on
and
we
knew
by
experience
that
one
does
not
melt
on
these
occasions
at
a
turn
of
the
road
we
met
another
group
of
riders
among
them
lady
n
who
during
her
husband
absence
in
england
was
living
at
a
country
house
in
the
hills
she
politely
stopped
and
would
have
spoken
but
it
was
not
weather
to
stand
talking
in
the
torrent
washed
us
apart
and
now
comes
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
a
thousand
feet
down
we
passed
out
below
the
clouds
into
clear
bright
sunshine
above
us
it
was
still
black
as
ever
the
vapour
clung
about
the
peaks
and
did
not
leave
them
underneath
us
and
round
us
it
was
a
lovely
summer
day
the
farther
we
descended
the
fewer
the
signs
that
any
rain
had
fallen
when
we
reached
the
stables
at
gordon
town
the
dust
was
on
the
road
as
we
left
it
and
the
horsekeeper
congratulated
us
on
the
correctness
of
his
forecast
clothes
soon
dry
in
that
country
and
we
drove
down
home
none
the
worse
for
our
wetting
i
was
glad
to
have
seen
a
place
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
on
the
whole
i
hoped
that
perhaps
the
authorities
may
discover
some
camping
ground
for
our
poor
soldiers
halfway
between
the
inferno
of
fort
augusta
and
the
caucasian
cliffs
to
which
they
are
chained
like
prometheus
malice
did
say
that
newcastle
was
the
property
of
a
certain
sir
a
high
official
of
a
past
generation
who
wished
to
part
with
it
and
found
a
convenient
purchaser
in
the
government
the
hospitalities
at
government
house
were
well
maintained
under
the
j
administration
the
colonel
was
gracious
the
lady
beautiful
and
brilliant
there
were
lawn
parties
and
evening
parties
when
all
that
was
best
in
the
island
was
collected
the
old
jamaican
aristocracy
army
and
navy
officers
civilians
eminent
lawyers
a
few
men
among
them
of
high
intelligence
the
tone
was
and
courteous
with
little
perhaps
too
little
of
the
of
younger
colonies
but
not
the
less
agreeable
on
that
account
as
to
prospects
or
the
present
condition
of
things
in
the
island
there
were
wide
differences
of
opinion
if
there
was
unanimity
about
anything
it
was
about
the
consequences
likely
to
arise
from
an
extension
of
the
principle
of
there
at
all
events
lay
the
right
road
to
the
wrong
place
the
blacks
had
nothing
to
complain
of
and
the
wrong
at
present
was
on
the
other
side
the
taxation
fell
heavily
on
the
articles
consumed
by
the
upper
classes
the
duty
on
tea
for
instance
was
a
shilling
a
pound
and
the
duties
on
other
luxuries
in
the
same
proportion
it
scarcely
touched
the
negroes
at
all
they
were
acquiring
land
and
some
thought
that
there
ought
to
be
a
land
tax
they
would
probably
object
and
resist
and
trouble
would
come
if
it
was
proposed
for
the
blacks
object
to
taxes
as
long
as
there
are
white
men
to
pay
them
they
will
be
satisfied
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
expenditure
but
let
not
their
english
friends
suppose
that
when
they
have
the
island
for
their
own
they
will
tax
themselves
for
police
or
schools
or
for
any
other
of
those
educational
institutions
from
which
the
believers
in
progress
anticipate
such
glorious
results
as
to
the
planters
it
seemed
agreed
that
when
an
estate
was
unencumbered
and
the
owner
resided
upon
it
and
managed
it
himself
he
could
still
keep
afloat
it
was
agreed
also
that
when
the
owner
was
an
absentee
the
cost
of
management
consumed
all
the
profits
and
thus
the
same
impulse
to
sell
which
had
gone
so
far
in
the
antilles
was
showing
itself
more
and
more
in
jamaica
also
fine
properties
all
about
the
island
were
in
the
market
for
any
price
which
purchasers
could
be
found
to
give
too
many
even
of
the
old
english
families
were
tired
of
the
struggle
and
were
longing
to
be
out
of
it
at
any
cost
at
one
time
we
heard
much
of
the
colonial
church
and
the
power
which
it
was
acquiring
and
as
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
political
authority
of
the
white
race
will
be
allowed
to
reassert
itself
it
must
be
through
their
minds
and
through
those
other
qualities
which
religion
addresses
that
the
black
race
will
be
influenced
by
the
white
if
it
is
ever
to
be
influenced
at
all
i
had
marked
the
respect
with
which
the
catholic
clergy
were
treated
in
dominica
and
even
the
hayti
republic
still
maintains
the
french
episcopate
and
priesthood
but
i
could
not
find
that
the
church
of
england
in
jamaica
either
was
at
present
or
had
ever
been
more
than
the
church
of
the
english
in
jamaica
respected
as
long
as
the
english
gentry
were
a
dominant
power
there
but
with
no
independent
charm
to
work
on
imagination
or
on
superstition
labat
says
as
i
noted
above
that
the
english
clergy
in
his
time
did
not
baptise
the
black
babies
on
the
curious
ground
that
christians
could
not
lawfully
be
held
as
slaves
and
the
slaves
therefore
were
not
to
be
made
christians
a
jesuit
father
whom
i
met
at
government
house
told
me
that
even
now
the
clergy
refuse
to
baptise
the
illegitimate
children
and
as
according
to
the
official
returns
nearly
of
the
children
that
are
born
in
jamaica
come
into
the
world
thus
irregularly
they
are
not
likely
to
become
more
popular
than
they
used
to
be
perhaps
father
was
doing
what
a
good
many
other
people
do
making
a
general
practice
out
of
a
few
instances
perhaps
the
blacks
themselves
who
wish
their
children
to
be
christians
carry
them
to
the
minister
whom
they
prefer
and
that
minister
may
not
be
the
anglican
clergyman
of
catholics
there
are
not
many
in
jamaica
of
the
moravians
i
heard
on
all
sides
the
warmest
praise
they
above
all
the
religious
bodies
in
the
island
are
admitted
to
have
a
practical
power
for
good
over
the
limited
number
of
people
which
belong
to
them
but
the
moravians
are
but
a
few
they
do
not
rush
to
make
converts
in
the
highways
and
hedges
and
my
observations
in
dominica
almost
led
me
to
wish
that
in
the
absence
of
other
forms
of
spiritual
authority
the
catholics
might
become
more
numerous
than
they
are
the
priests
in
dominica
were
the
only
europeans
who
for
their
own
sakes
and
on
independent
grounds
were
looked
up
to
with
fear
and
respect
the
religion
of
the
future
that
is
the
problem
of
problems
that
rises
before
us
at
the
close
of
this
waning
century
the
future
of
the
west
indies
is
a
small
matter
yet
that
too
like
all
else
depends
on
the
spiritual
beliefs
which
are
to
rise
out
of
the
present
confusion
men
will
act
well
and
wisely
or
ill
and
foolishly
according
to
the
form
and
force
of
their
conceptions
of
duty
once
before
under
the
roman
empire
the
conditions
were
not
wholly
dissimilar
the
inherited
creed
had
become
unbelievable
and
the
scientific
intellect
was
turning
materialist
christianity
rose
out
of
the
chaos
confounding
statesmen
and
philosophers
and
became
the
controlling
power
among
mankind
for
years
but
christianity
found
a
soil
prepared
for
the
seed
the
masses
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
roman
world
were
not
materialist
the
masses
of
the
people
believed
already
in
the
supernatural
and
in
penal
retribution
after
death
for
their
sins
lucretius
complains
of
the
misery
produced
upon
them
by
the
terrors
of
the
anticipated
tartarus
serious
and
good
men
were
rather
turning
away
from
atheism
than
welcoming
it
and
if
they
doubted
the
divinity
of
the
olympian
gods
it
was
not
because
they
doubted
whether
gods
existed
at
all
but
because
the
immoralities
attributed
to
them
were
unworthy
of
the
exalted
nature
of
the
divine
being
the
phenomena
are
different
now
who
is
now
made
wretched
by
the
fear
of
hell
the
tendency
of
popular
thought
is
against
the
supernatural
in
any
shape
far
into
space
as
the
telescope
can
search
deep
as
analysis
can
penetrate
into
mind
and
consciousness
or
the
forces
which
govern
natural
things
popular
thought
finds
only
uniformity
and
connection
of
cause
and
effect
no
sign
anywhere
of
a
personal
will
which
is
influenced
by
prayer
or
moral
motive
when
a
subject
is
still
obscure
we
are
confident
that
it
admits
of
scientific
explanation
we
no
longer
refer
deum
whom
we
regard
as
a
constitutional
monarch
taking
no
direct
part
at
all
the
new
creed
however
not
having
crystallised
as
yet
into
a
shape
which
can
be
openly
professed
and
as
without
any
creed
at
all
the
flesh
and
the
devil
might
become
too
powerful
we
maintain
the
old
names
and
forms
as
we
maintain
the
monarchy
we
surround
both
with
reverence
and
majesty
and
the
reverence
being
confined
to
feeling
continues
to
exercise
a
vague
but
wholesome
influence
we
row
in
one
way
while
we
look
another
in
the
presence
of
the
marked
decay
of
protestantism
as
a
positive
creed
the
protestant
powers
of
europe
may
perhaps
patch
up
some
kind
of
reconciliation
with
the
old
spiritual
organisation
which
was
shattered
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
has
since
shown
no
unwillingness
to
adapt
itself
to
modern
forms
of
thought
the
olympian
gods
survived
for
seven
centuries
after
aristophanes
with
the
help
of
allegory
and
the
church
of
rome
may
survive
as
long
after
calvin
and
luther
carlyle
mocked
at
the
possibility
when
i
ventured
to
say
so
to
him
yet
carlyle
seemed
to
think
that
the
mass
was
the
only
form
of
faith
in
europe
which
had
any
sincerity
remaining
in
it
a
religion
at
any
rate
which
will
keep
the
west
indian
blacks
from
falling
into
devil
worship
is
still
to
seek
constitutions
and
belief
in
progress
may
satisfy
europe
but
will
not
answer

of

child
murder
and
cannibalism
have
reappeared
in
hayti
but
without
them
things
might
have
been
worse
than
they
are
and
the
preservation
of
white
authority
and
influence
in
any
form
at
all
may
be
better
than
none
white
authority
and
white
influence
may
however
still
be
preserved
in
a
nobler
and
better
way
slavery
was
a
survival
from
a
social
order
which
had
passed
away
and
slavery
could
not
be
continued
it
does
not
follow
that
it
was
a
crime
the
negroes
who
were
sold
to
the
dealers
in
the
african
factories
were
most
of
them
either
slaves
already
to
worse
masters
or
were
servants
in
the
old
meaning
of
the
word
prisoners
of
war
or
else
criminals
or
reserved
from
death
they
would
otherwise
have
been
killed
and
since
the
slave
trade
has
been
abolished
are
again
killed
in
the
too
celebrated
the
slave
trade
was
a
crime
when
the
chiefs
made
war
on
each
other
for
the
sake
of
captives
whom
they
could
turn
into
money
in
many
instances
perhaps
in
most
it
was
innocent
and
even
beneficent
nature
has
made
us
unequal
and
acts
of
parliament
can
not
make
us
equal
some
must
lead
and
some
must
follow
and
the
question
is
only
of
degree
and
kind
for
myself
i
would
rather
be
the
slave
of
a
shakespeare
or
a
burghley
than
the
slave
of
a
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
or
the
slave
of
my
own
folly
slavery
is
gone
with
all
that
belonged
to
it
but
it
will
be
an
ill
day
for
mankind
if
no
one
is
to
be
compelled
any
more
to
obey
those
who
are
wiser
than
himself
and
each
of
us
is
to
do
only
what
is
right
in
our
own
eyes
there
may
be
authority
yet
not
slavery
a
soldier
is
not
a
slave
a
sailor
is
not
a
slave
a
child
is
not
a
slave
a
wife
is
not
a
slave
yet
they
may
not
live
by
their
own
wills
or
emancipate
themselves
at
their
own
pleasure
from
positions
in
which
nature
has
placed
them
or
into
which
they
have
themselves
voluntarily
entered
the

of
the

but
for
the
present
they
are
dreams
only
if
you
enforce
upon
them
when
they
are
not
asking
for
it
you
may
turn

into

after

arrival
i
heard
the
sound
of
church
bells
not
catholic
bells
as
at

good
old
english
chimes
the

is
disestablished

still
stand

to
those
immediately
connected
with
it
the
parochial
system
as
in
barbadoes
also
was
spread
over
the
island
each
parish
had
its
church
its
parsonage
and
its
school
its
fonts
where
the
white
children
were
baptised
in

of
my
jesuit
i
shall
hope
not
whites
only
and
its
graveyard
where
in
time
they
were
laid
to
rest
with
their
quiet
sunday
services
of
the
old
type
the
country
districts
were
exact
reproductions
of
english
country
villages
the
church
whose
bells
i
had
heard
was
of
the
more
fashionable
suburban
type
standing
in
a
central
situation
halfway
to
kingston
the
service
was
at
the
old
english
hour
of
eleven
we
drove
to
it
in
the
orthodox
fashion
with
our
prayer
books
and
sunday
costumes
the
colonel
in
uniform
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
are
antiquated
in
their
habits
and
to
go
to
church
on
sunday
is
still
regarded
as
a
simple
duty
a
dozen
carriages
stood
under
the
shade
at
the
doors
the
congregation
was
upper
english
of
the
best
sort
and
was
large
though
almost
wholly
white
white
tablets
as
at
port
royal
covered
the
walls
with
familiar
english
names
upon
them
but
for
the
heat
i
could
have
imagined
myself
at
home
there
were
no
aaron
bangs
to
be
seen
or
paul
gelids
with
the
rough
sense
the
vigour
the
energy
and
roystering
of
our
grandfathers
the
faces
of
the
men
were
serious
and
thoughtful
with
the
shadow
resting
on
them
of
an
uncertain
future
they
are
good
churchmen
still
and
walk
on
in
the
old
paths
wherever
those
paths
may
lead
they
are
and
slow
to
change
and
are
perhaps
belated
in
an
eddy
of
the
great
stream
of
progress
but
they
were
pleasant
to
see
and
pleasant
to
talk
to
after
service
there
were
the
usual
shakings
of
hands
among
friends
outside
arrangements
were
made
for
amusements
and
expeditions
in
which
i
was
invited
to
join
which
were
got
up
perhaps
for
my
own
entertainment
i
was
to
be
taken
to
the
sights
of
the
neighbourhood
i
was
to
see
this
i
was
to
see
that
above
all
i
must
see
the
peak
of
the
blue
mountains
the
peak
itself
i
could
see
better
from
below
for
there
it
stood
never
moving
between
seven
and
eight
thousand
feet
high
but
i
had
had
mountain
riding
enough
and
was
allowed
to
plead
my
age
and
infirmities
it
was
arranged
finally
that
i
should
be
driven
the
next
day
to
castleton
seventeen
miles
off
over
a
mountain
pass
to
see
the
botanical
gardens
accordingly
early
on
the
following
morning
we
set
off
two
carriages
full
of
us
m
a
new
friend
lately
made
but
i
hope
long
to
be
preserved
on
the
box
of
his
the
road
was
as
good
as
all
roads
are
in
jamaica
and
barbadoes
and
more
can
not
be
said
in
their
favour
forest
trees
made
a
roof
over
our
heads
as
we
climbed
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
thence
we
descended
the
side
of
a
long
valley
a
stream
running
below
us
which
gradually
grew
into
a
river
we
passed
through
all
varieties
of
cultivation
on
the
high
ground
there
was
a
large
sugar
plantation
worked
by
coolies
the
first
whom
i
had
seen
in
jamaica
in
the
alluvial
meadows
on
the
were
tobacco
fields
cleanly
and
carefully
kept
belonging
to
my
spanish
friend
in
kingston
and
only
too
rich
in
leaves
there
were
sago
too
and
ginger
and
tamarinds
and
cocoa
and
coffee
and
palms
on
the
were
the
garden
farms
of
the
blacks
which
were
something
to
see
and
remember
they
receive
from
the
government
at
an
almost
nominal
quit
rent
an
acre
or
two
of
uncleared
forest
to
this
as
the
first
step
they
set
light
at
twenty
different
spots
we
saw
their
fires
blazing
to
clear
an
acre
they
waste
the
timber
on
half
a
dozen
or
a
dozen
they
plant
their
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
among
the
ashes
and
grow
crops
there
till
the
soil
is
exhausted
then
they
move
on
to
another
which
they
treat
with
the
same
recklessness
leaving
the
first
to
go
back
to
scrub
since
the
chinaman
burnt
his
house
to
roast
his
pig
such
waste
was
never
seen
the
male
proprietors
were
lounging
about
smoking
their
wives
as
it
was
market
day
were
tramping
into
kingston
with
their
baskets
on
their
head
we
met
them
literally
in
thousands
all
merry
and
their
little
ones
with
little
baskets
trudging
at
their
side
of
the
lords
of
the
creation
we
saw
perhaps
one
to
each
hundred
women
and
he
would
be
riding
on
mule
or
donkey
pipe
in
mouth
and
carrying
nothing
he
would
be
generally
sulky
too
while
the
ladies
young
and
old
had
all
a
civil
word
for
us
and
curtsied
under
their
loads
decidedly
if
there
is
to
be
a
black
constitution
i
would
give
the
votes
only
to
the
women
we
reached
castleton
at
last
it
was
in
a
hot
damp
valley
said
to
be
a
nest
of
yellow
fever
the
gardens
slightly
disappointed
me
my
expectations
had
been
too
much
raised
by
trinidad
there
were
lovely
flowers
of
course
and
curious
plants
and
trees
every
known
palm
is
growing
there
they
try
hard
to
grow
roses
and
they
say
that
they
succeed
the
roses
were
not
in
flower
and
i
could
not
judge
bye
the
familiar
names
were
all
there
and
others
which
were
not
familiar
the
newest
importations
called
after
the
great
ladies
of
the
day
i
saw
one
labelled
mabel
morrison
to
find
the
daughter
of
an
ancient
college
friend
and
contemporary
giving
name
to
a
plant
in
the
new
world
makes
one
feel
dreadfully
old
but
i
expected
to
find
and
i
did
not
find
some
useful
practical
horticulture
going
on
they
ought
for
instance
to
have
been
trying
experiments
with
orange
trees
the
orange
in
jamaica
is
left
to
nature
they
plant
the
seeds
and
leave
the
result
to
chance
they
neither
bud
nor
graft
and
go
upon
the
hypothesis
that
as
the
seed
is
so
will
be
the
tree
which
comes
of
it
yet
even
thus
so
favourable
is
the
soil
and
climate
that
the
oranges
of
jamaica
are
prized
above
all
others
which
are
sold
in
the
american
market
with
skill
and
knowledge
and
good
selection
they
might
produce
the
finest
in
the
world
are
dollars
in
that
island
sir
as
an
american
gentleman
said
to
me
they
look
for
them
in
the
right
way
nothing
of
this
kind
was
going
on
at
castleton
so
much
the
worse
but
perhaps
things
will
mend
i
was
consoled
partly
by
another
specimen
of
the
it
was
not
so
large
as
those
which
i
had
seen
at
trinidad
but
it
was
in
splendid
bloom
and
certainly
is
the
most
gorgeous
flowering
tree
which
the
world
contains
wild
nature
also
was
luxuriantly
beautiful
we
picnicked
by
the
river
which
here
is
a
full
rushing
stream
with
pools
that
would
have
held
a
salmon
and
did
hold
abundant
mullet
we
found
a
bower
formed
by
a
twisted
vine
so
thick
that
neither
sun
nor
rain
could
penetrate
the
roof
the
floor
was
of
shining
shingle
and
the
air
breathed
cool
from
off
the
water
it
was
a
spot
which
nymph
or
naiad
may
haunt
hereafter
when
nymphs
are
born
again
in
the
new
era
the
creatures
of
imagination
have
fled
away
from
modern
enlightenment
but
we
were
a
pleasant
party
of
human
beings
lying
about
under
the
shade
upon
the
pebbles
we
had
brought
a
blanket
of
ice
with
us
and
the
champagne
was
manufactured
into
cup
by
choicest
west
indian
skill
figures
fall
unconsciously
at
such
moments
into
attitudes
which
would
satisfy
a
painter
and
the
scenes
remain
upon
the
memory
like
some
fine
finished
work
of
art
we
had
done
with
the
gardens
and
i
remember
no
more
of
them
except
that
i
saw
a
mongoose
stalking
a
flock
of
turkeys
the
young
ones
and
their
mother
gathered
together
and
showed
fight
the
old
cock
after
the
manner
of
the
male
animal
seemed
chiefly
anxious
for
his
own
skin
though
a
little
ashamed
at
the
same
time
as
if
conscious
that
more
was
expected
of
him
on
the
way
back
we
met
the
returning
stream
of
women
and
children
loaded
heavily
as
before
and
with
the
same
elastic
step
in
spite
of
all
that
is
incorrect
about
them
the
women
are
the
material
to
work
upon
and
if
they
saw
that
we
were
in
earnest
they
would
lend
their
help
to
make
their
husbands
bestir
themselves
a
dutch
gentleman
once
boasted
to
me
of
the
wonderful
prosperity
of
java
where
everybody
was
well
off
and
everybody
was
industrious
he
so
insisted
upon
the
industry
that
i
ask
him
how
it
was
brought
about
were
the
people
slaves
he
cried
as
if
shocked
forbid
that
a
christian
nation
should
be
so
wicked
as
to
keep
slaves
they
never
wish
to
be
idle
i
asked
never
he
said
no
we
do
not
permit
anyone
to
be
idle
my
stay
with
colonel
j
was
drawing
to
a
close
one
great
festivity
was
impending
which
i
wished
to
avoid
but
the
gracious
lady
insisted
that
i
must
remain
there
was
to
be
a
ball
and
all
the
neighbourhood
was
invited
pretty
it
was
sure
to
be
windows
and
doors
galleries
and
passages
would
be
all
open
the
gardens
would
be
lighted
up
and
the
guests
could
spread
as
they
pleased
brilliant
it
all
was
more
brilliant
than
you
would
see
in
our
larger
colonies
a
ball
in
sydney
or
melbourne
is
like
a
ball
in
the
north
of
england
or
in
new
york
there
are
the
young
men
in
black
coats
and
there
are
brightly
dressed
young
ladies
for
them
to
dance
with
the
chaperons
sit
along
the
walls
the
elderly
gentlemen
withdraw
to
the
card
room
here
all
was
different
the
black
coats
in
the
ball
at
jamaica
were
on
the
backs
of
old
or
men
and
except
government
officials
there
was
hardly
a
young
man
present
in
civilian
dress
the
rooms
glittered
with
scarlet
and
white
and
blue
and
gold
lace
the
officers
were
there
from
the
garrison
and
the
fleet
but
of
men
of
business
of
professional
men
merchants
planters
lawyers
there
were
only
those
who
had
grown
up
to
middle
age
in
the
island
whose
fortunes
bad
or
good
were
bound
up
with
it
when
these
were
gone
it
seemed
as
if
there
would
be
no
one
to
succeed
them
the
coveted
heirs
of
great
estates
were
no
longer
to
be
found
for
mothers
to
angle
after
the
trades
and
professions
in
kingston
had
ceased
to
offer
the
prospect
of
an
income
to
younger
brothers
who
had
to
make
their
own
way
for
years
generations
of
englishmen
had
followed
one
upon
another
but
we
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
last
of
gentlemen
unconnected
with
the
public
service
under
or
forty
there
were
few
to
be
seen
they
were
seeking
their
fortunes
elsewhere
the
english
interest
in
jamaica
is
still
a
considerable
thing
the
english
flag
flies
over
government
house
and
no
one
so
far
wishes
to
remove
it
but
the
british
population
is
scanty
and
refuses
to
grow
ships
and
regiments
come
and
go
and
officers
and
state
employés
make
what
appears
to
be
a
brilliant
society
but
it
is
in
appearance
only
the
station
is
no
longer
a
favourite
one
they
are
gone
those
pleasant
gentry
whose
country
houses
were
the
paradise
of
sixty
years
ago
all
is
changed
even
to
the
officers
themselves
the
drawling
ensign
of
our
boyhood
brave
as
a
lion
in
the
field
and
in
the
mess
room
or
the
drawing
room
an
idiot
appears
also
to
be
dead
as
the
dodo
those
that
one
meets
now
are
intelligent
and
superior
men
no
trace
of
the
frivolous
sort
left
is
it
the
effect
of
the
abolition
of
purchase
and
competitive
examinations
is
it
that
the
times
themselves
are
growing
serious
and
even
the
most
feel
that
this
is
no
season
for
levity
i
had
seen
what
jamaican
life
was
like
in
the
upper
spheres
and
i
had
heard
the
opinions
that
were
current
in
them
but
i
wished
to
see
other
parts
of
the
country
i
wished
to
see
a
class
of
people
who
were
farther
from
headquarters
and
who
might
not
all
sing
to
the
same
note
i
determined
to
start
off
on
an
independent
cruise
of
my
own
in
the
centre
of
the
island
two
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
it
was
reported
to
me
that
i
should
find
a
delightful
village
called
mandeville
after
some
duke
of
manchester
who
governed
jamaica
a
hundred
years
ago
the
scenery
was
said
to
have
a
special
charm
of
its
own
the
air
to
be
exquisitely
pure
the
land
to
be
well
cultivated
village
manners
were
to
be
found
there
of
the
sort
and
a
lodging
house
and
landlady
of
unequalled
merit
there
was
a
railway
for
the
first
fifty
miles
the
line
at
starting
crosses
the
mangrove
swamps
at
the
mouth
of
the
cobre
river
you
see
the
trees
standing
in
the
water
on
each
side
of
the
road
rising
slowly
it
hardens
into
level
grazing
ground
stocked
with
cattle
and
studded
with
mangoes
and
cedars
you
pass
spanish
town
of
which
only
the
roofs
of
the
old
state
buildings
are
visible
from
the
carriages
sugar
estates
follow
some
of
which
are
still
in
cultivation
while
ruined
mills
and
fallen
aqueducts
show
where
others
once
had
been
the
scenery
becomes
more
broken
as
you
begin
to
ascend
into
the
hills
river
beds
dry
when
i
saw
them
but
powerful
torrents
in
the
rainy
season
are
crossed
by
picturesque
bridges
you
come
to
the
forest
where
the
squatters
were
at
their
usual
work
burning
out
their
yam
patches
columns
of
white
smoke
were
rising
all
about
us
yet
so
abundant
the
timber
and
so
rapid
the
work
of
restoration
when
the
devastating
swarm
has
passed
that
in
this
direction
they
have
as
yet
made
no
marked
impression
and
the
forest
stretches
as
far
as
eye
can
reach
the
glens
grew
more
narrow
and
the
trees
grander
as
the
train
proceeded
after
two
hours
we
arrived
at
the
present
terminus
an
inland
town
with
the
singular
name
of
porus
no
explanation
is
given
of
it
in
the
local
handbooks
but
i
find
a
porus
among
the
companions
of
columbus
and
it
is
probably
an
interesting
relic
of
the
first
spanish
occupation
the
railway
had
brought
business
mule
carts
were
going
about
and
waggons
omnibuses
stood
in
the
yards
and
there
were
stores
of
various
kinds
but
it
was
all
black
there
was
not
a
white
face
to
be
seen
after
we
left
the
station
one
of
my
companions
in
the
train
was
a
cuban
engineer
now
employed
upon
the
line
a
refugee
i
conjectured
belonging
to
the
beaten
party
in
the
late
rebellion
from
the
bitterness
with
which
he
spoke
of
the
spanish
administration
porus
is
many
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
in
a
hollow
where
three
valleys
meet
mandeville
to
which
i
was
bound
was
ten
miles
farther
on
the
road
ascending
all
the
way
a
carriage
was
waiting
for
me
but
too
small
for
my
luggage
a
black
boy
offered
to
carry
up
a
heavy
bag
for
a
shilling
a
feat
which
he
faithfully
and
expeditiously
performed
after
climbing
a
steep
hill
we
came
out
upon
a
rich
undulating
plateau
long
cleared
and
cultivated
green
fields
with
cows
feeding
on
them
pretty
houses
standing
in
gardens
a
wesleyan
station
a
moravian
station
with
chapels
and
parsonages
the
red
soil
was
mixed
with
crumbling
lumps
of
white
coral
a
and
inexhaustible
supply
of
manure
great
trees
towered
up
in
lonely
magnificence
the
home
of
the
dreaded
jumbi
woe
to
the
wretch
who
strikes
an
axe
into
those
sacred
stems
almonds
cedars
mangoes
gum
trees
spread
their
shade
over
the
road
orange
trees
were
everywhere
sometimes
in
orchards
sometimes
growing
at
their
own
wild
will
in
hedges
and
copse
and
thicket
finally
at
the
outskirts
of
a
perfectly
english
village
we
brought
up
at
the
door
of
the
lodging
house
kept
by
the
justly
celebrated
miss
roy
the
house
or
cottage
stood
at
the
roadside
at
the
top
of
a
steep
flight
of
steps
a
rambling
building
from
which
rooms
had
been
thrown
out
as
they
were
wanted
there
was
the
universal
green
verandah
into
which
they
all
opened
and
the
windows
looked
out
on
a
large
common
used
of
old
and
perhaps
now
as
a
on
wooded
slopes
with
sunny
mansions
dropped
here
and
there
in
openings
among
the
woods
on
farm
buildings
at
intervals
in
the
distance
surrounded
by
clumps
of
palms
and
beyond
them
ranges
of
mountains
almost
as
blue
as
the
sky
against
which
they
were
faintly
visible
miss
roy
the
lady
and
mistress
of
the
establishment
came
out
to
meet
me
with
a
touch
of
the
black
blood
but
with
a
face
in
which
one
places
instant
and
sure
dependence
shrewd
quiet
sensible
and
entirely
a
brother
somewhat
infirm
and
older
than
she
glided
behind
her
as
her
shadow
she
attends
to
the
business
his
pride
is
in
his
garden
where
he
has
gathered
a
collection
of
rare
plants
in
admired
disorder
the
cereus
hanging
carelessly
over
a
broken
paling
and
a
palm
unique
of
its
kind
waving
behind
it
at
the
back
were
orange
trees
and
plantains
and
coffee
bushes
with
humming
birds
flitting
about
their
nests
among
the
branches
all
kinds
of
delicacies
from
fruit
and
preserves
to
coffee
miss
roy
grows
for
her
visitors
on
her
own
soil
and
prepares
from
the
first
stage
to
the
last
with
her
own
cunning
hands
having
made
acquaintance
with
the
mistress
i
strolled
out
to
look
about
me
after
walking
up
the
road
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
found
myself
in
an
exact
reproduction
of
a
warwickshire
hamlet
before
the
days
of
railways
and
brick
chimneys
there
were
no
elms
to
be
sure
there
were
silk
and
mangoes
where
the
elms
should
have
been
but
there
were
the
boys
playing
cricket
and
a
market
house
and
a
modest
inn
and
a
shop
or
two
and
a
blacksmith
forge
with
a
shed
where
horses
were
standing
waiting
their
turn
to
be
shod
across
the
green
was
the
parish
church
with
its
three
aisles
and
low
square
tower
in
which
hung
an
old
peal
of
bells
parish
stocks
i
did
not
observe
though
perhaps
i
might
have
had
i
looked
for
them
but
there
was
a
schoolhouse
and
parsonage
and
withdrawn
at
a
distance
as
of
superior
dignity
what
had
once
perhaps
been
the
squire
mansion
when
squire
and
had
been
the
natural
growth
of
the
country
it
was
as
if
a
branch
of
the
old
tree
had
been
carried
over
and
planted
there
ages
ago
and
as
if
it
had
taken
root
and
become
an
exact
resemblance
of
the
parent
stock
the
people
had
black
faces
but
even
they
too
had
shaped
their
manners
on
the
old
english
models
the
men
touched
their
hats
respectfully
as
they
eminently
did
not
in
kingston
and
its
environs
the
women
smiled
and
curtsied
and
the
children
looked
shy
when
one
spoke
to
them
the
name
of
slavery
is
a
horror
to
us
but
there
must
have
been
something
human
and
kindly
about
it
too
when
it
left
upon
the
character
the
marks
of
courtesy
and
good
breeding
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
the
effect
of
modern
ideas
the
negroes
in
mandeville
were
perhaps
as
happy
in
their
old
condition
as
they
have
been
since
their
glorious
emancipation
and
some
of
them
to
this
day
speak
regretfully
of
a
time
when
children
did
not
die
of
neglect
when
the
sick
and
the
aged
were
taken
care
of
and
the
strong
and
healthy
were
at
least
as
well
looked
after
as
their
owner
cattle
slavery
could
not
last
but
neither
can
the
condition
last
which
has
followed
it
the
equality
between
black
and
white
is
a
forced
equality
and
not
a
real
one
and
nature
in
the
long
run
has
her
way
and
readjusts
in
their
proper
relations
what
theorists
and
philanthropists
have
disturbed
i
was
not
miss
roy
only
guest
an
american
lady
and
gentleman
were
staying
there
he
i
believe
for
his
health
as
the
climate
of
mandeville
is
celebrated
americans
whatever
may
be
their
faults
are
always
unaffected
and
so
are
easy
to
get
on
with
we
dined
together
and
talked
of
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
they
had
been
struck
like
myself
with
the
manners
of
the
peasants
which
were
something
entirely
new
to
them
the
lady
said
and
without
expressing
the
least
disapproval
that
she
had
fallen
in
with
an
old
slave
who
told
her
that
thanks
to
god
he
had
seen
good
times
was
bred
in
a
good
home
with
a
master
and
mistress
belonging
to
him
what
the
master
and
mistress
had
the
slaves
had
and
there
was
no
difference
and
his
master
used
to
visit
at
king
house
and
his
men
were
all
proud
of
him
yes
glory
be
to
god
he
had
seen
good
times
in
the
evening
we
sat
out
in
the
verandah
in
the
soft
sweet
air
the
husband
and
i
smoking
our
cigars
and
the
lady
not
minding
it
they
had
come
to
mandeville
as
we
go
to
italy
to
escape
the
new
england
winter
they
had
meant
to
stay
but
a
few
days
they
found
it
so
charming
that
they
had
stayed
for
many
weeks
we
talked
on
till
twilight
became
night
and
then
appeared
a
show
of
natural
pyrotechnics
which
beat
anything
of
the
kind
which
i
had
ever
seen
or
read
of
fireflies
as
large
as
cockchafers
flitting
round
us
among
the
leaves
of
the
creepers
with
two
long
antennæ
at
the
point
of
each
of
which
hangs
out
a
blazing
lanthorn
the
unimaginative
colonists
call
them
had
shakespeare
ever
heard
of
them
they
would
have
played
round
ferdinand
and
miranda
in
prospero
cave
and
would
have
borne
a
fairer
name
the
light
is
like
a
glowworm
but
immeasurably
brighter
and
we
could
trace
them
far
away
glancing
like
spirits
over
the
meadows
i
could
not
wonder
that
my
new
friends
had
been
charmed
with
the
place
the
air
was
exquisitely
pure
the
temperature
ten
degrees
below
that
of
kingston
never
oppressively
hot
and
never
cold
the
forest
scenery
as
beautiful
as
at
arden
and
miss
roy
provision
for
us
rooms
beds
breakfasts
dinners
absolutely
without
fault
if
ever
there
was
an
inspired
coffee
maker
miss
roy
was
that
person
the
glory
of
mandeville
is
in
its
oranges
the
worst
orange
i
ate
in
jamaica
was
better
than
the
best
i
ever
ate
in
europe
and
the
best
oranges
of
jamaica
are
the
oranges
of
mandeville
new
york
has
found
out
their
merits
one
gentleman
alone
sent
twenty
thousand
boxes
to
new
york
last
year
clearing
a
dollar
on
each
box
and
this
as
i
said
just
now
when
nature
is
left
to
produce
what
she
pleases
and
art
has
not
begun
to
help
her
fortunes
larger
than
were
ever
made
by
sugar
wait
for
any
man
and
the
blessings
of
the
world
along
with
it
who
will
set
himself
to
work
at
orange
growing
with
skill
and
science
in
a
place
where
heat
will
not
wither
the
trees
nor
frosts
as
in
florida
bite
off
the
blossoms
yellow
fever
was
never
heard
of
there
nor
any
dangerous
epidemic
nor
snake
nor
other
poisonous
reptile
the
droughts
which
parch
the
lowlands
are
unknown
for
an
even
rain
falls
all
the
year
and
the
soil
is
always
moist
i
inquired
with
wonder
why
the
unfortunate
soldiers
who
were
perched
among
the
crags
at
newcastle
were
not
at
mandeville
instead
i
was
told
that
water
was
the
difficulty
that
there
was
no
river
or
running
stream
there
and
that
it
had
to
be
drawn
from
wells
or
collected
into
cisterns
one
must
applaud
the
caution
which
the
authorities
have
at
last
displayed
but
cattle
thrive
at
mandeville
and
sheep
and
black
men
and
women
in
luxuriant
abundance
one
would
like
to
know
that
the
general
who
sold
the
newcastle
estate
to
the
government
was
not
the
same
person
who
was
allowed
to
report
as
to
the
capabilities
of
a
spot
which
to
the
common
observer
would
seem
as
perfectly
adapted
for
the
purpose
as
the
other
is
detestable
a
few
english
families
were
scattered
about
the
neighbourhood
among
whom
i
made
a
passing
acquaintance
they
had
a
club
in
the
village
which
met
once
a
week
they
drove
in
with
their
pony
carriages
a
lady
made
tea
under
the
trees
they
had
amusements
and
pleasant
society
which
cost
nothing
they
were
not
rich
but
they
were
courteous
simple
frank
and
cordial
mandeville
is
the
centre
of
a
district
which
all
resembles
it
in
character
and
extends
for
many
miles
it
is
famous
for
its
cattle
as
well
as
for
its
fruit
and
has
excellent
grazing
grounds
an
officer
of
police
took
me
round
with
him
one
morning
it
was
the
old
story
though
there
were
still
a
few
white
proprietors
left
they
were
growing
fewer
and
the
blacks
were
multiplying
upon
them
the
smoke
of
their
clearances
showed
where
they
were
at
work
many
of
them
are
becoming
we
met
them
on
the
roads
with
their
carts
and
mules
the
young
ones
armed
too
in
some
instances
with
good
there
is
no
game
to
shoot
but
to
have
a
gun
raises
them
in
their
own
estimation
and
they
like
to
be
prepared
for
contingencies
had
a
troublesome
place
of
it
the
negro
peasantry
were
he
said
but
not
universally
honest
they
stole
cattle
and
would
not
give
evidence
against
each
other
if
brought
into
court
they
held
a
pebble
in
their
mouths
being
under
the
impression
that
when
they
were
so
provided
perjury
did
not
count
their
education
was
only
and
the
schools
which
the
government
provided
had
not
touched
their
characters
at
all
duties
brought
him
in
contact
with
the
unfavourable
specimens
i
received
a
far
pleasanter
impression
from
a
moravian
minister
who
called
on
me
with
a
friend
who
had
lately
taken
a
farm
i
was
particularly
glad
to
see
this
gentleman
for
of
the
moravians
everyone
had
spoken
well
to
me
he
was
not
the
least
enthusiastic
about
his
poor
black
sheep
but
he
said
that
if
they
were
not
better
than
the
average
english
labourers
he
did
not
think
them
worse
they
were
called
idle
they
would
work
well
enough
if
they
had
fair
wages
and
if
the
wages
were
paid
regularly
but
what
could
be
expected
when
women
servants
had
but
three
shillings
a
week
and
themselves
when
the
men
had
but
a
shilling
a
day
and
the
pay
was
kept
in
arrear
in
order
that
if
they
came
late
to
work
or
if
they
came
irregularly
it
might
be
kept
back
or
cut
down
to
what
the
employer
chose
to
give
under
such
conditions
any
man
of
any
colour
would
prefer
to
work
for
himself
if
he
had
a
garden
or
would
be
idle
if
he
had
none
costs
next
to
nothing
either
to
them
or
their
families
but
the
minister
said
and
his
friend
confirmed
it
by
his
own
experience
that
these
same
fellows
would
work
regularly
and
faithfully
for
any
master
whom
they
personally
knew
and
could
rely
upon
and
no
englishman
coming
to
settle
there
need
be
afraid
of
failing
for
want
of
labour
if
he
had
sense
and
energy
and
did
not
prefer
to
lie
down
and
groan
the
blacks
my
friends
said
were
kindly
hearted
respectful
and
but
they
were
children
easily
excited
easily
tempted
easily
misled
and
totally
unfit
for
if
we
wished
to
ruin
them
altogether
we
should
persevere
in
the
course
to
which
they
were
sorry
to
hear
we
were
so
inclined
the
real
want
in
the
island
was
of
intelligent
englishmen
to
employ
and
direct
them
and
englishmen
were
going
away
so
fast
that
they
feared
there
would
soon
be
none
of
them
left
this
was
the
opinion
of
two
moderate
and
excellent
men
whose
natural
and
professional
prejudices
were
all
on
the
black
man
side
it
was
confirmed
both
in
its
favourable
and
unfavourable
aspects
by
another
impartial
authority
my
first
american
acquaintances
had
gone
but
their
rooms
were
occupied
by
another
of
their
countrymen
a
specimen
of
a
class
of
whom
more
will
be
heard
in
jamaica
if
the
fates
are
kind
the
english
in
the
island
cast
in
their
lot
with
sugar
and
if
sugar
is
depressed
they
lose
heart
americans
keep
their
skinned
as
they
call
it
to
look
out
for
other
openings
they
have
discovered
as
i
said
there
are
dollars
in
jamaica
and
one
has
come
and
has
set
up
a
trade
in
plantains
in
which
he
is
making
a
fortune
and
this
gentleman
has
perceived
that
there
were
in
the
bamboo
and
for
bamboos
there
was
no
place
in
the
world
like
the
west
indies
he
came
to
jamaica
brought
machines
to
clear
the
fibre
tried
to
make
ropes
of
it
to
make
canvas
paper
and
i
know
not
what
i
think
he
told
me
that
he
had
spent
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
instead
of
finding
any
before
he
hit
upon
a
paying
use
for
it
the
bamboo
fibre
has
certain
elastic
incompressible
properties
in
which
it
is
without
a
rival
he
forms
it
into
for
the
boxes
of
the
wheels
of
railway
carriages
where
it
holds
oil
like
a
sponge
never
hardens
and
never
wears
out
he
sends
the
packing
over
the
world
and
the
demand
grows
as
it
is
tried
he
has
set
up
a
factory
thirty
miles
from
mandeville
in
the
valley
of
the
black
river
he
has
a
large
body
of
the
negroes
working
for
him
who
are
said
to
be
so
unmanageable
he
like
nicholls
in
dominica
does
not
find
them
unmanageable
at
all
they
never
leave
him
they
work
for
him
from
year
to
year
as
regularly
as
if
they
were
slaves
they
have
their
small
faults
but
he
does
not
magnify
them
into
vices
they
are
attached
to
him
with
the
affection
which
good
labourers
always
feel
for
employers
whom
they
respect
and
dismissal
is
dreaded
as
the
severest
of
punishments
in
the
course
of
time
he
thought
that
they
might
become
fit
for
political
privileges
to
confer
such
privileges
on
them
at
present
would
fling
jamaica
back
into
absolute
barbarism
i
said
i
wished
that
more
of
his
countrymen
would
come
and
settle
in
jamaica
as
he
had
done
and
a
few
others
already
american
energy
would
be
like
new
blood
in
the
veins
of
the
poor
island
he
answered
that
many
would
probably
come
if
they
could
be
satisfied
that
there
would
be
no
more
political
experimenting
but
they
would
not
risk
their
capital
if
there
was
a
chance
of
a
black
parliament
if
we
choose
to
make
jamaica
into
a
hayti
we
need
not
look
for
americans
down
that
way
let
us
hope
that
enthusiasm
for
constitutions
will
for
once
moderate
its
ardour
the
black
race
has
suffered
enough
at
our
hands
they
have
been
sacrificed
to
slavery
are
they
to
be
sacrificed
again
to
a
dream
or
a
doctrine
there
has
a
new
creed
risen
while
the
old
creed
is
failing
it
has
its
priests
and
its
prophets
its
formulas
and
its
articles
of
belief
whosoever
will
be
saved
before
all
things
it
is
necessary
that
he
hold
the
radical
faith
and
the
radical
faith
is
this
all
men
are
equal
and
the
voice
of
one
is
as
the
voice
of
another
and
whereas
one
man
is
wise
and
another
foolish
and
one
is
upright
and
another
crooked
yet
in
this
suffrage
none
is
greater
or
less
than
another
the
vote
is
equal
the
dignity
truth
is
one
and
right
is
one
yet
right
is
right
because
the
majority
so
declare
it
and
justice
is
justice
because
the
majority
so
declare
it
and
if
the
majority
affirm
one
thing
that
is
right
and
if
the
majority
affirm
the
opposite
that
is
right
because
the
will
of
the
majority
is
the
ground
of
right
and
there
is
no
other
this
is
the
radical
faith
which
except
every
man
do
keep
whole
and
undefiled
he
is
a
tory
and
an
enemy
of
the
state
and
without
doubt
shall
perish
everlastingly
once
the
radical
was
a
liberal
and
went
for
toleration
and
freedom
of
opinion
he
has
become
a
believer
now
he
is
right
and
you
are
wrong
and
if
you
do
not
agree
with
him
you
are
a
fool
and
you
are
wicked
besides
voltaire
says
that
atheism
and
superstition
are
the
two
poles
of
intellectual
disease
superstition
he
thinks
the
worse
of
the
two
the
atheist
is
merely
mistaken
and
can
be
cured
if
you
show
him
that
he
is
wrong
the
fanatic
can
never
be
cured
yet
each
alike
if
he
prevails
will
destroy
human
society
what
would
voltaire
have
expected
for
poor
mankind
had
he
seen
both
the
precious
qualities
combined
in
this
new
a
creed
is
not
a
reasoned
judgment
based
upon
experience
and
insight
it
is
a
child
of
imagination
and
passion
like
an
organised
thing
it
has
its
appointed
period
and
then
dies
you
can
not
argue
it
out
of
existence
it
works
for
good
it
works
for
evil
but
work
it
will
while
the
life
is
in
it
faith
we
are
told
is
not
contradictory
to
reason
but
is
above
reason
whether
reason
or
faith
sees
truer
events
will
prove
one
more
observation
this
american
gentleman
made
to
me
he
was
speaking
of
the
want
of
spirit
and
of
the
despondency
of
the
west
indian
whites
never
knew
sir
he
said
good
come
of
desponding
men
if
you
intend
to
strike
a
mark
you
had
better
believe
that
you
can
strike
it
no
one
ever
hit
anything
if
he
thought
that
he
was
most
likely
to
miss
it
you
must
take
a
cheerful
view
of
things
or
you
will
have
no
success
in
this
world
heart
tyne
a
the
scotch
proverb
says
the
indians
are
tyning
heart
and
that
is
the
worst
feature
about
them
they
can
get
no
help
except
in
themselves
and
they
can
help
themselves
after
all
if
we
allow
them
fair
play
the
americans
will
not
touch
them
politically
but
they
will
trade
with
them
they
will
bring
their
capital
and
their
skill
and
knowledge
among
them
and
make
the
islands
richer
and
more
prosperous
than
ever
they
were
on
one
condition
they
will
risk
nothing
in
such
enterprises
as
long
as
the
shadow
hangs
over
them
of
a
possible
government
by
a
black
majority

it

indeed

a

is

with
he
is
sent
on
with
letters
of
introduction
from

house
to
another
and
is
assured
of
a
favourable
reception
i
was
treated
as
kindly
as
any
stranger
would
be
and
that
was
as
kindly
as
possible
but
friends
do
not
ask

i

me
unless
some
general
interest
attaches
either
to
himself
or
his
residence
such
interest
does
however
attach
to
a
spot
where
after
leaving
mandeville
i
passed
a
few
days
the
present
owner
of
it
was
the
chief
manager
of
the
kingston
branch
of
the
colonial
bank
a
clever
accomplished
man
of
business
who
understood
the
financial
condition
of
the
west
indies
better
perhaps
than
any
other
man
living
he
was
a
botanist
besides
he
had
a
fine
collection
of
curious
plants
which
were
famous
in
the
island
and
was
otherwise
a
gentleman
of
the
highest
standing
and
reputation
his
lady
was
one
of
the
old
island
aristocracy
cultivated
an
accomplished
artist
a
person
who
would
have
shone
anywhere
and
in
any
circle
and
was
therefore
contented
to
be
herself
and
indifferent
whether
she
shone
or
not
a
visit
in
such
a
family
was
likely
to
be
instructive
and
was
sure
to
be
agreeable
and
on
these
grounds
alone
i
should
have
accepted
gratefully
the
opportunity
of
knowing
them
better
which
they
kindly
made
for
me
by
an
invitation
to
stay
with
them
but
their
place
which
was
called
cherry
garden
and
which
i
had
seen
from
the
grounds
at
government
house
had
a
further
importance
of
its
own
in
having
been
the
home
of
the
unfortunate
george
william
gordon
the
disturbances
with
which
gordon
was
connected
and
for
his
share
in
which
he
was
executed
are
so
recent
and
so
notorious
that
i
need
give
no
detailed
account
of
them
though
of
course
i
looked
into
the
history
again
and
listened
to
all
that
i
could
hear
about
it
though
i
had
taken
no
part
in
eyre
defence
i
was
one
of
those
who
thought
from
the
first
that
eyre
had
been
unworthily
sacrificed
to
public
clamour
had
the
agitation
in
jamaica
spread
and
taken
the
form
which
it
easily
might
have
taken
he
would
have
been
blamed
as
keenly
by
one
half
the
world
if
he
had
done
nothing
to
check
it
as
he
was
blamed
in
fact
by
the
other
for
too
much
energy
carlyle
used
to
say
that
it
was
as
if
when
a
ship
had
been
on
fire
and
the
captain
by
skill
and
promptitude
had
put
the
fire
out
his
owner
were
to
say
to
him
you
poured
too
much
water
down
the
hold
and
damaged
the
cargo
the
captain
would
answer
sir
but
i
have
saved
your
ship
this
was
the
view
which
i
carried
with
me
to
jamaica
and
i
have
brought
it
back
with
me
the
same
in
essentials
though
qualified
by
clearer
perceptions
of
the
real
nature
of
the
situation
something
of
a
very
similar
kind
had
happened
in
natal
just
before
i
visited
that
colony
in
i
had
seen
the
whites
there
hardly
recovering
from
a
panic
in
which
a
common
police
case
had
been
magnified
by
fear
into
the
beginning
of
an
insurrection
langalibalele
a
caffre
chief
within
the
british
dominions
had
been
insubordinate
he
had
been
sent
for
to
maritzberg
and
had
invented
excuses
for
disobedience
to
a
lawful
order
the
whites
believed
at
once
that
there
was
to
be
a
general
caffre
rebellion
in
which
they
would
all
be
murdered
they
resolved
to
be
beforehand
with
it
they
carried
fire
and
sword
through
two
considerable
tribes
at
first
they
thought
that
they
had
covered
themselves
with
glory
calmer
reflection
taught
many
of
them
that
perhaps
they
had
been
too
hasty
and
that
langalibalele
had
never
intended
to
rebel
at
all
the
jamaican
disturbance
was
of
a
similar
kind
gordon
had
given
less
provocation
than
the
caffre
chief
but
the
circumstances
were
analogous
and
the
actual
danger
was
probably
greater
jamaica
had
then
constitutional
though
not
what
is
called
responsible
government
the
executive
power
remained
with
the
crown
there
had
been
differences
of
opinion
between
the
governor
and
the
assembly
gordon
a
man
of
colour
was
a
prominent
member
of
the
opposition
he
had
called
public
meetings
of
the
blacks
in
a
distant
part
of
the
island
and
was
endeavouring
to
bring
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
on
the
opposition
side
imprudent
as
such
a
step
might
have
been
among
an
ignorant
and
excitable
population
where
whites
and
blacks
were
so
unequal
in
numbers
and
where
they
knew
so
little
of
each
other
gordon
was
not
going
beyond
what
in
constitutional
theory
he
was
legally
entitled
to
do
nor
was
his
language
on
the
platform
though
violent
and
inflammatory
any
more
so
than
what
we
listen
to
patiently
at
home
under
a
popular
constitution
the
people
are
sovereign
the
members
of
the
assemblies
are
popular
delegates
and
when
there
is
a
diversion
of
opinion
any
man
has
a
right
to
call
the
constituencies
to
express
their
sentiments
if
stones
were
thrown
at
the
police
and
seditious
cries
were
raised
it
was
no
more
than
might
be
reasonably
expected
we
at
home
can
be
calm
on
such
occasions
because
we
know
that
there
is
no
real
danger
and
that
the
law
is
strong
enough
to
assert
itself
in
jamaica
a
few
thousand
white
people
were
living
in
the
middle
of
negroes
forty
times
their
number
once
their
slaves
now
raised
to
be
their
political
equals
each
regarding
the
other
on
the
least
provocation
with
resentment
and
suspicion
in
england
the
massacre
in
hayti
is
a
story
not
one
person
in
a
thousand
of
those
who
clamoured
for
the
prosecution
of
governor
eyre
had
probably
ever
heard
of
it
in
jamaica
it
is
ever
present
in
the
minds
of
the
europeans
as
a
frightful
evidence
of
what
the
negroes
are
capable
when
roused
to
frenzy
the
french
planters
had
done
nothing
particularly
cruel
to
deserve
their
animosity
and
were
as
well
regarded
by
their
slaves
as
ever
we
had
been
in
the
english
islands
yet
in
a
fever
of
political
excitement
and
as
a
reward
for
the
decree
of
the
paris
revolutionary
government
which
declared
them
free
they
allowed
the
liberty
which
was
to
have
elevated
them
to
the
white
man
level
to
turn
them
into
devils
and
they
massacred
the
whole
of
the
french
inhabitants
it
was
inevitable
that
when
the
volcano
in
jamaica
began
to
show
symptoms
of
similar
activity
the
whites
residing
there
should
be
unable
to
look
on
with
the
calmness
which
we
from
thousands
of
miles
away
unreasonably
expected
of
them
they
imagined
their
houses
in
flames
and
themselves
and
their
families
at
the
mercy
of
a
furious
mob
no
personal
relation
between
the
two
races
has
grown
up
to
take
the
place
of
slavery
the
white
gentry
have
blacks
for
labourers
blacks
for
domestic
servants
yet
as
a
rule
though
of
course
there
are
exceptions
they
have
no
interest
in
each
other
no
esteem
nor
confidence
therefore
any
symptom
of
agitation
is
certain
to
produce
a
panic
and
panic
is
always
violent
the
blacks
who
attended
gordon
meetings
came
armed
with
guns
and
cutlasses
a
party
of
white
volunteers
went
in
consequence
to
watch
them
and
to
keep
order
if
they
showed
signs
of
meaning
insurrection
stones
were
thrown
the
riot
act
was
read
more
stones
followed
and
then
the
volunteers
fired
and
several
persons
were
killed
of
course
there
was
fury
the
black
mob
then
actually
did
rise
they
marched
about
that
particular
district
destroying
plantations
and
burning
houses
that
they
did
so
little
and
that
the
flame
did
not
spread
was
a
proof
that
there
was
no
premeditation
of
rebellion
no
prepared
plan
of
action
no
previous
communication
between
the
different
parts
of
the
island
with
a
view
to
any
common
movement
there
was
no
proof
and
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
gordon
had
intended
an
armed
outbreak
he
would
have
been
a
fool
if
he
had
when
constitutional
agitation
and
the
weight
of
numbers
at
his
back
would
have
secured
him
all
that
he
wanted
when
inflammable
materials
are
brought
together
and
sparks
are
flying
you
can
not
equitably
distribute
the
blame
or
the
punishment
eyre
was
responsible
for
the
safety
of
the
island
he
was
not
a
jamaican
the
rule
in
the
colonial
service
is
that
a
governor
remains
in
any
colony
only
long
enough
to
begin
to
understand
it
he
is
then
removed
to
another
of
which
he
knows
nothing
he
is
therefore
absolutely
dependent
in
any
difficulty
upon
local
advice
when
the
riots
began
every
white
man
in
jamaica
was
of
one
opinion
that
unless
the
fire
was
stamped
out
promptly
they
would
all
be
murdered
being
without
experience
himself
it
was
very
difficult
for
eyre
to
disregard
so
complete
a
unanimity
i
suppose
that
a
perfectly
calm
and
determined
man
would
have
seen
in
the
unanimity
itself
the
evidence
of
alarm
and
imagination
he
ought
perhaps
to
have
relied
entirely
on
the
police
and
the
regular
troops
and
to
have
called
in
the
volunteers
but
here
again
was
a
difficulty
for
the
police
were
black
and
the
west
india
regiments
were
black
and
the
sepoy
rebellion
was
fresh
in
everybody
memory
he
had
no
time
to
deliberate
he
had
to
act
and
to
act
promptly
and
if
relying
on
his
own
judgment
he
had
disregarded
what
everyone
round
him
insisted
upon
and
if
mischief
had
afterwards
come
of
it
the
censure
which
would
have
fallen
upon
him
would
have
been
as
severe
as
it
would
have
been
deserved
he
assumed
that
the
english
colonists
were
right
and
that
a
general
rebellion
had
begun
they
all
armed
they
formed
into
companies
the
disturbed
district
was
placed
under
martial
law
and
these
extemporised
regiments
too
few
in
number
to
be
merciful
saw
safety
only
in
striking
terror
into
the
poor
wretches
it
was
in
jamaica
as
it
was
in
natal
afterwards
but
we
must
allow
for
human
nature
and
not
be
hasty
to
blame
if
the
rising
at
morant
bay
was
but
the
boiling
over
of
a
pot
from
the
orator
of
an
excited
patriot
there
was
deplorable
cruelty
and
violence
but
again
it
was
all
too
natural
men
do
not
bear
easily
to
see
their
late
servants
on
their
way
to
become
their
political
masters
and
they
believe
the
worst
of
them
because
they
are
afraid
a
model
governor
would
have
rather
restrained
their
ardour
than
encouraged
it
but
all
that
can
be
said
against
eyre
so
far
as
regarded
the
general
suppression
of
the
insurgents
is
that
he
acted
as
nine
hundred
and
men
out
of
a
thousand
would
have
acted
in
his
place
and
more
ought
not
to
be
expected
of
average
colonial
governors
his
treatment
of
gordon
the
original
cause
of
the
disturbance
was
more
questionable
gordon
had
returned
to
his
own
house
the
house
where
i
was
going
within
sight
of
eyre
windows
it
would
have
been
fair
and
perhaps
right
to
arrest
him
and
right
also
to
bring
him
to
trial
if
he
had
committed
any
offence
for
which
he
could
be
legally
punished
so
strong
was
the
feeling
against
him
that
if
every
white
man
in
kingston
had
been
empannelled
there
would
have
been
a
unanimous
verdict
and
they
would
not
have
looked
too
closely
into
niceties
of
legal
construction
unfortunately
it
was
doubtful
whether
gordon
had
done
anything
which
could
be
construed
into
a
capital
crime
he
had
a
right
to
call
public
meetings
together
he
had
a
right
to
appeal
to
political
passions
and
to
indulge
as
freely
as
he
pleased
in
the
patriotic
commonplaces
of
platforms
provided
he
did
not
himself
advise
or
encourage
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
this
it
could
not
be
easily
proved
that
he
had
done
he
was
however
the
leader
of
the
opposition
to
the
government
the
opposition
had
broken
into
a
riot
and
gordon
was
guilty
of
having
excited
the
feelings
which
led
to
it
the
leader
could
not
be
allowed
to
escape
unpunished
while
his
followers
were
being
shot
and
flogged
the
kingston
district
where
he
resided
was
under
the
ordinary
law
eyre
sent
him
into
the
district
which
was
under
martial
law
tried
him
by
a
military
court
and
hanged
him
the
cabinet
at
home
at
first
thanked
their
representative
for
having
saved
the
island
a
clamour
rose
and
they
sent
out
a
commission
to
examine
into
what
had
happened
the
commission
reported
unfavourably
and
eyre
was
dismissed
and
ruined
in
jamaica
i
never
heard
anyone
express
a
doubt
on
the
full
propriety
of
his
action
he
carried
away
with
him
the
affection
and
esteem
of
the
whole
of
the
english
colonists
who
believe
that
he
saved
them
from
destruction
in
my
own
opinion
the
fault
was
not
in
eyre
and
was
not
in
the
unfortunate
gordon
but
in
those
who
had
insisted
on
applying
a
constitutional
form
of
government
to
a
country
where
the
population
is
so
unfavourably
divided
if
the
numbers
of
white
and
black
were
more
nearly
equal
the
objection
would
be
less
for
the
natural
superiority
of
the
white
would
then
assert
itself
without
difficulty
and
there
would
be
no
panics
where
the
disproportion
is
so
enormous
as
it
is
in
jamaica
where
intelligence
and
property
are
in
a
miserable
minority
and
a
race
of
savages
cannibals
not
long
ago
and
capable
as
the
state
of
hayti
shows
of
reverting
to
cannibalism
again
are
living
beside
them
as
their
political
equals
such
panics
arise
from
the
nature
of
things
and
will
themselves
cause
the
catastrophe
from
the
dread
of
which
they
spring
mutual
fear
and
mistrust
can
lead
to
nothing
in
the
end
but
violent
collisions
the
theory
of
constitutional
government
is
that
the
majority
shall
rule
the
minority
and
as
long
as
the
qualities
moral
and
mental
of
the
parties
are
not
grossly
dissimilar
such
an
arrangement
forms
a
tolerable
where
in
character
in
mental
force
in
energy
in
cultivation
there
is
no
equality
at
all
but
an
inequality
which
has
existed
for
thousands
of
years
and
is
as
plain
as
it
was
in
the
egypt
of
the
pharaohs
to
expect
that
the
intelligent
few
will
submit
to
the
unintelligent
many
is
to
expect
what
has
never
been
found
and
what
never
ought
to
be
found
the
whites
can
not
be
trusted
to
rule
the
blacks
but
for
the
blacks
to
rule
the
whites
is
a
yet
grosser
anomaly
were
england
out
of
the
way
there
would
be
a
war
of
extermination
between
them
england
prohibits
it
and
holds
the
balance
in
forced
equality
england
therefore
so
long
as
the
west
indies
are
english
must
herself
rule
and
rule
impartially
and
so
acquit
herself
of
her
responsibilities
let
the
colonies
which
are
occupied
by
our
own
race
rule
themselves
as
we
rule
ourselves
the
english
constituencies
have
no
rights
over
the
constituencies
of
canada
and
australia
for
the
canadians
and
australians
are
as
well
able
to
manage
their
own
affairs
as
we
are
to
manage
ours
if
they
prefer
even
to
elect
governors
of
their
own
let
them
do
as
they
please
the
link
between
us
is
community
of
blood
and
interest
and
will
not
part
over
details
of
administration
but
in
these
other
colonies
which
are
our
own
we
must
accept
the
facts
as
they
are
those
who
will
not
recognise
realities
are
always
beaten
in
the
end
the
train
from
porus
brought
us
back
to
kingston
an
hour
before
sunset
the
evening
was
lovely
even
for
jamaica
the
sea
breeze
had
fallen
the
land
breeze
had
not
risen
and
the
dust
lay
harmless
on
road
and
hedge
cherry
garden
to
which
i
was
bound
was
but
seven
miles
distant
by
the
direct
road
so
i
calculated
on
a
delightful
drive
which
would
bring
me
to
my
destination
before
dark
so
i
calculated
but
alas
for
human
expectation
i
engaged
a
at
the
station
with
a
conductor
who
assured
me
that
he
knew
the
way
to
cherry
garden
as
well
as
to
his
own
door
his
horse
looked
starved
and
miserable
he
insisted
that
there
was
not
another
in
kingston
that
was
more
than
a
match
for
it
we
set
out
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
miles
we
went
on
well
enough
conversing
amicably
upon
things
in
general
but
it
so
happened
that
it
was
again
market
day
the
road
was
thronged
as
before
with
women
plodding
along
with
their
baskets
on
their
heads
a
single
male
on
a
donkey
to
each
detachment
of
them
carrying
nothing
like
an
officer
with
a
company
of
soldiers
foolish
indignation
rose
in
me
and
i
asked
my
friend
if
he
was
not
ashamed
of
seeing
the
poor
creatures
toiling
so
cruelly
while
their
lords
and
masters
amused
themselves
i
appealed
to
his
feelings
as
a
man
as
if
it
was
likely
that
he
had
got
any
the
wretch
only
laughed
massa
he
said
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
do
women
work
men
do
men
work
all
right
what
is
men
work
i
asked
instead
of
answering
he
went
on
at
they
women
massa
how
they
laugh
how
happy
they
be
nobody
more
happy
than
black
woman
massa
i
would
not
let
him
off
i
pricked
into
him
till
he
got
excited
too
and
we
argued
and
contradicted
each
other
till
at
last
the
horse
finding
he
was
not
attended
to
went
his
own
way
and
that
was
a
wrong
one
between
kingston
and
our
destination
there
is
a
deep
sandy
flat
overgrown
with
bush
and
penetrated
in
all
directions
with
labyrinthine
lanes
into
this
we
had
wandered
in
our
quarrels
and
neither
of
us
knew
where
we
were
the
sand
was
loose
our
miserable
beast
was
above
his
fetlocks
in
it
and
was
visibly
dropping
under
his
efforts
to
drag
us
along
even
at
a
walk
the
sun
went
down
the
tropic
twilight
is
short
the
evening
star
shone
out
in
the
west
and
the
crescent
moon
over
our
heads
my
man
said
this
and
said
that
every
word
was
a
lie
for
he
had
lost
his
way
and
would
not
allow
it
we
saw
a
light
through
some
trees
i
sent
him
to
inquire
we
were
directed
one
way
and
another
way
every
way
except
the
right
one
we
emerged
at
last
upon
a
hard
road
of
some
kind
the
stars
told
me
the
general
direction
we
came
to
cottages
where
the
name
of
cherry
garden
was
known
and
we
were
told
that
it
was
two
miles
off
but
alas
again
there
were
two
roads
to
it
a
short
and
good
one
and
a
long
and
bad
one
and
they
sent
us
by
the
last
there
was
a
steep
hill
to
climb
for
the
house
is
feet
above
the
sea
the
horse
could
hardly
crawl
and
my
went
to
work
to
flog
him
to
let
off
his
own
ill
humour
i
had
to
stop
that
by
force
and
at
last
as
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
the
road
under
the
trees
i
got
out
and
walked
leaving
him
to
follow
at
a
foot
pace
the
night
was
lovely
i
began
to
think
that
we
should
have
to
camp
out
after
all
and
that
it
would
be
no
great
hardship
it
was
like
the
gloaming
of
a
june
night
in
england
the
daylight
in
the
open
spots
not
entirely
gone
and
mixing
softly
with
the
light
of
moon
and
planet
and
the
flashing
of
the
fireflies
i
plodded
on
mile
after
mile
and
cherry
garden
still
receded
to
one
mile
farther
we
came
to
a
gate
of
some
consequence
the
outline
of
a
large
mansion
was
visible
with
gardens
round
it
i
concluded
that
we
had
arrived
and
was
feeling
for
the
latch
when
the
forms
of
a
lady
and
gentleman
appeared
against
the
sky
who
were
strolling
in
the
grounds
they
directed
me
still
upwards
with
the
mile
which
never
diminished
still
to
be
travelled
like
myself
our
weary
animal
had
gathered
hopes
from
the
sight
of
the
gate
he
had
again
to
drag
on
as
he
could
his
owner
was
subdued
and
silent
and
obeyed
whatever
order
i
gave
him
the
trees
now
closed
over
us
so
thick
that
i
could
see
nothing
vainly
i
repented
of
my
unnecessary
philanthropy
which
had
been
the
cause
of
the
mischief
what
had
i
to
do
with
black
women
or
white
either
for
that
matter
i
had
to
feel
the
way
with
my
feet
and
a
stick
i
came
to
a
place
where
the
lane
again
divided
i
tried
the
nearest
turn
i
found
a
trench
across
it
three
feet
deep
which
had
been
cut
by
a
torrent
this
was
altogether
beyond
the
capacity
of
our
unfortunate
animal
so
i
took
the
other
boldly
prepared
if
it
proved
wrong
to
bivouac
till
morning
with
my
and
go
on
with
my
argument
happily
there
was
no
need
we
came
again
on
a
gate
which
led
into
a
field
there
was
a
drive
across
it
and
wire
fences
finally
lights
began
to
glimmer
and
dogs
to
bark
we
were
at
the
real
cherry
garden
at
last
and
found
the
whole
household
alarmed
for
what
had
become
of
us
i
could
not
punish
my
misleader
by
stinting
his
fare
for
i
knew
that
i
had
only
myself
to
blame
he
was
an
honest
fellow
after
all
in
the
disturbance
of
my
mind
i
left
a
rather
valuable
umbrella
in
his
buggy
he
discovered
it
after
he
had
gone
and
had
grace
enough
to
see
that
it
was
returned
to
me
my
entertainers
were
much
amused
at
the
cause
of
the
misadventure
perhaps
unique
of
its
kind
to
address
homilies
to
the
black
people
on
the
treatment
of
their
wives
not
being
the
fashion
in
these
parts
if
there
are
no
more
aaron
bangs
in
jamaica
there
are
very
charming
people
as
i
found
when
i
turned
this
new
leaf
in
my
west
indian
experience
m
could
not
have
taken
more
pains
with
me
if
i
had
been
his
earliest
friend
the
chief
luxury
which
he
allowed
himself
in
his
simple
life
was
a
good
supply
of
excellent
horses
his
business
took
him
every
day
to
kingston
but
he
left
me
in
charge
of
his
family
and
i
had
good
time
as
the
americans
say
the
house
was
large
with
fine
airy
rooms
a
draught
so
constantly
blowing
through
it
that
the
candles
had
to
be
covered
with
bell
glasses
but
the
draughts
in
these
countries
are
the
very
breath
of
life
it
had
been
too
dark
when
i
arrived
to
see
anything
of
the
surroundings
and
the
next
morning
i
strolled
out
to
see
what
the
place
was
like
it
lies
just
at
the
foot
of
the
blue
mountains
where
the
gradual
slope
from
the
sea
begins
to
become
steep
the
plain
of
kingston
lay
stretched
before
me
with
its
woods
and
cornfields
and
villas
the
long
straggling
town
the
ships
at
anchor
in
the
harbour
the
steamers
passing
in
and
out
with
their
long
trails
of
smoke
the
like
a
thin
grey
line
lying
upon
the
water
as
the
natural
breakwater
by
which
the
harbour
is
formed
and
beyond
it
the
broad
blue
expanse
of
the
caribbean
sea
the
foreground
was
like
an
english
park
studded
over
with
handsome
forest
trees
and
broken
by
the
rains
into
picturesque
ravines
some
acres
were
planted
with
oranges
of
the
choicer
sorts
as
an
experiment
to
show
what
jamaica
could
do
but
they
were
as
yet
young
and
had
not
come
into
bearing
round
the
house
were
gardens
where
the
treasures
of
our
were
carelessly
and
lavishly
scattered
stephanotis
trailed
along
the
railing
or
climbed
over
the
trellis
oleanders
white
and
pink
waved
over
marble
basins
and
were
sprinkled
by
the
spray
from
spouting
fountains
crotons
stood
about
in
tubs
not
small
plants
as
we
know
them
but
large
shrubs
great
purple
or
bushes
they
have
a
fancy
for
crotons
in
the
west
indies
i
suppose
as
a
change
from
the
monotony
of
green
i
can
not
share
it
a
red
leaf
except
in
autumn
before
it
falls
is
a
kind
of
monster
and
i
am
glad
that
nature
has
made
so
few
of
them
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
behind
the
house
was
a
collection
of
orchids
the
most
perfect
i
believe
in
the
island
illustration
kingston
and
harbour
from
cherry
garden
and
here
gordon
had
lived
here
he
had
been
arrested
and
carried
away
to
his
death
his
crime
being
that
he
had
dreamt
of
regenerating
the
negro
race
by
baptising
them
in
the
jordan
of
english
radicalism
he
would
have
brought
about
nothing
but
confusion
and
have
precipitated
jamaica
prematurely
into
the
black
anarchy
into
which
perhaps
it
is
still
destined
to
fall
but
to
hang
him
was
an
extreme
measure
and
in
the
present
state
of
public
opinion
a
dangerous
one
one
does
not
associate
the
sons
of
darkness
with
keen
perceptions
of
the
beautiful
yet
no
mortal
ever
selected
a
lovelier
spot
for
a
residence
than
did
gordon
in
choosing
cherry
garden
how
often
had
his
round
dark
eyes
wandered
over
the
scenes
at
which
i
was
gazing
watched
the
early
rays
of
the
sun
slanting
upwards
to
the
high
peaks
of
the
blue
mountains
or
the
last
as
he
sank
in
gold
and
crimson
behind
the
hills
at
mandeville
watched
the
great
steamers
entering
or
leaving
port
royal
and
at
night
the
gleam
of
the
lighthouse
from
among
the
palm
trees
on
the
spit
poor
fellow
one
felt
very
sorry
for
him
and
sorry
for
eyre
too
the
only
good
that
came
of
it
all
was
the
surrender
of
the
constitution
and
the
return
to
crown
government
and
this
our
wonderful
statesmen
are
beginning
to
undo
no
one
understood
better
than
m
the
troubles
and
dangers
of
the
colony
but
he
was
inclined
perhaps
by
temperament
perhaps
by
knowledge
to
take
a
cheerful
view
of
things
for
the
present
at
least
he
did
not
think
that
there
was
anything
serious
to
be
feared
the
finances
of
which
he
had
the
best
means
of
judging
were
in
tolerable
condition
the
debt
was
considerable
but
more
than
half
of
it
was
represented
by
a
railway
if
sugar
was
languishing
the
fruit
trade
with
the
united
states
was
growing
with
the
liveliest
rapidity
planters
and
merchants
were
not
making
fortunes
but
business
went
on
the
shares
in
the
colonial
bank
were
not
at
a
high
quotation
but
the
securities
were
sound
the
shareholders
got
good
dividends
and
eight
and
ten
per
cent
was
the
interest
charged
on
loans
high
interest
might
be
a
good
sign
or
a
bad
one
anyway
m
could
not
see
that
there
was
much
to
be
afraid
of
in
jamaica
there
had
been
bad
times
before
and
they
had
survived
notwithstanding
he
was
a
man
of
business
and
talked
himself
little
about
politics
as
it
had
been
so
it
would
be
again
in
his
absence
at
his
work
i
found
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
who
were
all
attention
and
politeness
one
took
me
to
see
my
acquaintances
at
the
camp
again
another
drove
me
about
showed
me
the
house
where
scott
had
lived
the
author
of
cringle
one
round
in
particular
left
a
distinct
impression
it
was
through
a
forest
which
had
once
been
a
flourishing
sugar
estate
deep
among
the
trees
were
the
ruins
of
an
aqueduct
which
had
brought
water
to
the
mill
now
overgrown
and
crumbling
the
time
had
not
been
long
as
we
count
time
in
the
history
of
nations
but
there
had
been
enough
for
the
arches
to
fall
in
the
stream
to
return
to
its
native
bed
the
tropical
vegetation
to
spring
up
in
its
wild
luxuriance
and
bury
in
shade
the
ruins
of
a
past
civilisation
i
fell
in
with
interesting
persons
who
talked
metaphysics
and
theology
with
me
though
one
would
not
have
expected
it
in
jamaica
in
this
strange
age
of
ours
the
spiritual
atmosphere
is
more
confused
than
at
any
period
during
the
last
eighteen
hundred
years
men
hearts
are
failing
them
for
fear
not
knowing
any
longer
where
to
rest
we
look
this
way
and
that
way
and
catch
at
one
another
like
drowning
men
go
where
you
will
you
find
the
same
phenomena
science
grows
and
observers
are
adding
daily
to
our
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
structure
of
the
material
universe
but
they
tell
us
nothing
and
can
tell
us
nothing
of
what
we
most
want
to
know
they
can
not
tell
us
what
our
own
nature
is
they
can
not
tell
us
what
god
is
or
what
duty
is
we
had
a
belief
once
in
which
as
in
a
boat
we
floated
safely
on
the
unknown
ocean
but
the
philosophers
and
critics
have
been
boring
holes
in
the
timbers
to
examine
the
texture
of
the
wood
and
now
it
leaks
at
every
one
of
them
we
have
to
help
ourselves
in
the
best
way
that
we
can
some
strike
out
new
ideas
for
themselves
others
go
back
to
the
seven
sages
and
lay
again
for
themselves
the
old
eggs
which
after
laborious
incubation
will
be
addled
as
they
were
addled
before
to
my
metaphysical
friends
in
jamaica
the
of
asia
had
been
shining
amidst
german
dreams
and
the
moonlight
of
the
vedas
had
been
illuminating
the
pessimism
of
schopenhauer
so
it
is
all
round
goes
to
mount
carmel
to
listen
for
communications
from
elijah
fashionable
countesses
to
the
shrine
of
our
lady
at
lourdes
you
a
buddhist
lisps
the
young
lady
in
mayfair
to
the
partner
with
whom
she
is
sitting
out
at
a
ball
is
so
nice
said
a
gentleman
to
me
who
has
been
since
promoted
to
high
office
in
an
unfortunate
colony
is
so
nice
to
talk
of
such
things
to
pretty
girls
and
it
always
ends
in
one
way
you
know
conversations
on
theology
at
least
between
persons
of
opposite
sex
ought
to
be
interdicted
by
law
for
everyone
under
forty
but
there
are
questions
on
which
old
people
may
be
permitted
to
ask
one
another
what
they
think
if
it
only
be
for
mutual
comfort
in
the
general
vacancy
we
are
born
alone
we
pass
alone
into
the
great
darkness
when
the
curtain
falls
is
the
play
over
or
is
a
new
act
to
commence
are
we
to
start
again
in
a
new
sphere
carrying
with
us
what
we
have
gained
in
the
discipline
of
our
earthly
trials
are
we
to
become
again
as
we
were
before
we
came
into
this
world
when
eternity
had
not
yet
splintered
into
time
or
the
universal
being
dissolved
into
individual
existences
for
myself
i
have
long
ceased
to
speculate
on
these
subjects
being
convinced
that
they
have
no
bottom
which
can
be
reasoned
out
by
the
intellect
we
are
in
a
world
where
much
can
be
learnt
which
affects
our
own
and
others
earthly
welfare
and
we
had
better
leave
the
rest
alone
yet
one
listens
and
can
not
choose
but
sympathise
when
anxious
souls
open
out
to
you
what
is
going
on
within
them
a
spanish
legend
showing
with
whom
these
inquiries
began
and
with
what
result
is
not
without
its
value
jupiter
having
made
the
world
proceeded
to
make
animals
to
live
in
it
the
ass
was
the
earliest
created
he
looked
about
him
he
looked
at
himself
and
as
the
habit
of
asses
is
he
asked
himself
what
it
all
meant
what
it
was
to
be
an
ass
where
did
he
come
from
and
what
he
was
for
not
being
able
to
discover
he
applied
to
his
maker
jupiter
told
him
that
he
was
made
to
be
the
slave
of
another
animal
to
be
called
man
he
was
to
carry
men
on
his
back
drag
loads
for
them
and
be
their
drudge
he
was
to
live
on
thistles
and
straw
and
to
be
beaten
continually
with
sticks
and
the
ass
complained
he
said
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
so
hard
a
fate
he
had
not
asked
to
be
born
and
he
would
rather
not
have
been
born
he
inquired
how
long
this
life
or
whatever
it
was
had
to
continue
jupiter
said
it
had
to
last
thirty
years
the
poor
ass
was
in
consternation
if
jupiter
would
reduce
the
thirty
to
ten
he
undertook
to
be
patient
to
be
a
good
servant
and
to
do
his
work
patiently
jupiter
reflected
and
consented
and
the
ass
retired
grateful
and
happy
the
dog
who
had
been
born
meanwhile
heard
what
had
passed
he
too
went
to
jupiter
with
the
same
question
he
learnt
that
he
also
was
a
slave
to
men
in
the
day
he
was
to
catch
their
game
for
them
but
was
not
to
eat
it
himself
at
night
he
was
to
be
chained
by
a
ring
and
to
lie
awake
to
guard
their
houses
his
food
was
to
be
bones
and
refuse
like
the
ass
he
was
to
have
had
thirty
years
of
it
but
on
petition
they
were
similarly
exchanged
for
ten
the
monkey
came
next
his
function
he
was
told
was
to
mimic
humanity
to
be
led
about
by
a
string
and
grimace
and
dance
for
men
amusement
he
also
remonstrated
at
the
length
of
time
and
obtained
the
same
favour
last
came
the
man
himself
conscious
of
boundless
desires
and
as
he
imagined
of
boundless
capabilities
he
did
not
inquire
what
he
was
or
what
he
was
to
do
those
questions
had
been
already
answered
by
his
vanity
he
did
not
come
to
ask
for
anything
but
to
thank
jupiter
for
having
created
so
glorious
a
being
and
to
ascertain
for
how
many
ages
he
might
expect
to
endure
the
god
replied
that
thirty
years
was
the
term
allotted
to
all
personal
existences
thirty
years
he
exclaimed
thirty
years
for
such
capacities
as
mine
thirty
years
will
be
gone
like
a
dream
extend
them
oh
extend
them
gracious
jupiter
that
i
may
have
leisure
to
use
the
intellect
which
thou
hast
given
me
search
into
the
secrets
of
nature
do
great
and
glorious
actions
and
serve
and
praise
thee
o
my
creator
longer
and
more
worthily
the
lip
of
the
god
curled
lightly
and
again
he
acquiesced
have
some
spare
years
to
dispose
of
he
said
which
others
of
my
creatures
have
begged
to
be
relieved
you
shall
have
thirty
years
of
your
own
from
thirty
to
fifty
you
shall
have
the
ass
years
and
labour
and
sweat
for
your
support
from
fifty
to
seventy
you
shall
have
the
years
and
take
care
of
the
stuff
and
snarl
and
growl
at
what
younger
men
are
doing
from
seventy
to
ninety
you
shall
have
the
monkey
years
and
smirk
and
grin
and
make
yourself
ridiculous
after
that
you
may
depart
i
was
going
on
to
cuba
the
commodore
had
insisted
on
my
spending
my
last
days
with
him
at
port
royal
he
undertook
to
see
me
on
board
the
steamer
as
it
passed
out
of
the
harbour
i
have
already
described
his
quarters
the
naval
station
has
no
colonial
character
except
the
climate
and
is
english
entirely
the
officers
are
the
servants
of
the
admiralty
not
of
the
colonial
government
their
interests
are
in
their
profession
they
look
to
promotion
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
their
functions
are
on
the
ocean
and
not
on
the
land
the
commodore
is
captain
of
the
guardship
but
he
has
a
commander
under
him
and
he
resides
on
shore
everyone
employed
in
the
dockyard
even
down
to
his
own
household
is
rated
on
the
ship
books
consequently
they
are
all
men
there
is
not
a
woman
servant
about
the
place
save
his
his
daughters
learn
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
are
not
brought
up
to
find
everything
done
for
them
his
boys
are
about
the
world
in
active
service
growing
into
useful
and
honourable
manhood
thus
the
whole
life
tastes
of
the
element
to
which
it
belongs
and
is
salt
and
healthy
as
the
ocean
itself
it
was
not
without
its
entertainments
the
officers
of
the
garrison
were
to
give
a
ball
the
young
ladies
of
kingston
are
not
afraid
of
the
water
cross
the
harbour
in
the
steam
launches
dance
till
the
small
hours
return
in
the
dark
drive
their
eight
or
ten
miles
home
and
think
nothing
of
it
in
that
climate
night
is
pleasanter
to
be
abroad
in
than
day
i
could
not
stay
to
be
present
but
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
preparations
and
one
afternoon
there
was
a
prospect
of
a
brilliant
addition
to
the
party
a
yacht
steamed
inside
the
point
long
narrow
and
swift
as
a
torpedo
boat
she
carried
american
colours
and
we
heard
that
she
was
the
famous
vessel
of
the
yet
more
famous
vanderbilt
who
was
on
board
with
his
family
here
was
an
excitement
the
commodore
was
ordered
to
call
the
instant
that
she
was
anchored
invitations
were
prepared
all
was
eagerness
alas
she
did
not
anchor
at
all
she
learnt
from
the
pilot
that
the
being
in
jamaica
if
any
of
her
people
landed
there
she
would
be
quarantined
in
the
other
islands
and
to
the
disappointment
of
everyone
even
of
myself
who
would
gladly
have
seen
the
great
millionaire
she
turned
about
and
went
off
again
to
sea
i
was
very
happy
at
the
commodore
low
spirits
not
being
allowed
in
that
wholesome
element
decks
were
washed
every
morning
as
if
at
sea
every
floor
was
scrubbed
and
scoured
it
was
an
eternal
washing
day
lines
of
linen
flying
in
the
brisk
sea
breeze
the
commodore
was
always
busy
making
work
if
none
had
been
found
for
him
he
took
me
one
day
to
see
the
rock
spring
where
rodney
watered
his
fleet
as
the
great
admiral
describes
in
one
of
his
letters
and
from
which
port
royal
now
draws
its
supply
the
spring
itself
bursts
full
and
clear
out
of
the
limestone
rock
close
to
the
shore
four
or
five
miles
from
kingston
there
is
a
natural
basin
slightly
improved
by
art
from
which
the
old
conduit
pipes
carry
the
stream
to
the
sea
the
tug
comes
daily
fills
its
tanks
and
returns
the
commodore
has
tidied
up
the
place
planted
shrubs
and
cleared
away
the
bush
but
half
the
water
at
least
is
still
allowed
to
leak
away
and
turns
the
hollow
below
into
an
unwholesome
swamp
it
may
be
a
necessity
but
it
is
also
a
misfortune
that
the
officers
at
distant
stations
hold
their
appointments
for
so
short
a
term
by
the
time
that
they
have
learnt
what
can
or
ought
to
be
done
they
are
sent
elsewhere
and
their
successor
has
to
begin
over
again
the
water
in
this
spring
part
of
which
is
now
worse
than
wasted
and
the
rest
carried
laboriously
in
a
vessel
to
port
royal
to
be
sold
by
measure
to
the
people
there
might
be
all
conducted
thither
by
pipes
at
small
cost
and
trouble
were
the
commodore
to
remain
a
few
years
longer
at
the
jamaica
station
he
is
his
own
boatman
and
we
had
some
fine
sails
about
the
lagoon
the
breeze
always
fresh
and
the
surface
always
smooth
the
shallow
bays
swarm
with
small
fish
and
it
was
a
pretty
thing
to
watch
the
pelicans
devouring
them
they
gather
in
flocks
sweep
and
wheel
in
the
air
and
when
they
plunge
they
strike
the
water
with
a
violence
which
one
would
expect
would
break
their
wings
they
do
not
dive
but
seize
their
prey
with
their
long
broad
bills
and
seem
never
to
miss
between
the
ships
and
the
barracks
there
are
many
single
men
in
port
royal
for
whom
amusement
has
to
be
found
if
they
are
to
be
kept
from
drink
a
canteen
is
provided
for
them
with
bowling
alley
tennis
court
beer
in
moderation
and
a
reading
room
for
such
as
like
it
with
reviews
and
magazines
and
newspapers
they
can
fish
if
they
want
sport
and
there
are
sharks
in
plenty
a
cable
length
from
shore
but
the
schoolmaster
has
been
abroad
and
tastes
run
in
more
refined
directions
the
blacks
of
tobago
acted
merchant
of
venice
before
governor
s
the
ships
companies
of
the
gunboats
at
port
royal
gave
a
concert
while
i
was
there
the
officers
took
no
part
and
left
the
men
to
manage
it
as
they
pleased
the
commodore
brought
his
party
the
garrison
the
crews
of
the
other
ships
and
stray
visitors
came
and
the
large
room
at
the
canteen
was
completely
full
the
taste
of
the
audience
was
curious
dibdin
was
off
the
boards
altogether
and
favour
was
divided
between
the
london
popular
comic
song
and
the
sentimental
no
longer
with
any
flavour
of
salt
about
it
but
the
sentimental
spoony
and
sickly
wore
a
wreath
of
roses
called
out
the
highest
enthusiasm
one
of
the
performers
recited
a
long
poem
of
his
own
about
mary
stuart
lovely
and
unfortunate
then
followed
the
buffoonery
and
this
was
at
least
genuine
rough
and
tumble
if
there
was
little
wit
in
it
a
lad
capered
about
on
a
tournament
horse
which
flung
him
every
other
moment
various
persons
pretended
to
be
drunk
and
talked
and
staggered
as
drunken
men
do
then
there
was
a
farce
how
conceived
and
by
what
kind
of
author
i
was
puzzled
to
make
out
a
connoisseur
of
art
is
looking
for
greek
antiques
he
has
heard
that
a
statue
has
recently
been
discovered
of
quarrelling
with
his
what
ajax
was
quarrelling
about
or
who
his
might
be
does
not
appear
a
couple
of
rogues
each
unknown
to
the
other
practise
on
the
credulity
each
promises
him
the
statue
each
dresses
up
a
confederate
on
a
pedestal
with
a
modern
soldier
helmet
and
a
blanket
to
represent
a
greek
hero
the
two
figures
are
shown
to
him
one
of
them
i
forget
how
contrived
to
pass
as
ajax
the
other
had
turned
into
hercules
doing
something
to
the
stymphalides
at
last
they
get
tired
of
standing
to
be
looked
at
jump
down
and
together
knock
over
the
connoisseur
ajax
then
turns
on
hercules
who
of
course
is
ready
for
a
row
they
fight
till
they
are
tired
and
then
make
it
up
over
a
whisky
bottle
so
entirely
new
an
aspect
of
the
british
tar
took
me
by
surprise
and
i
speculated
whether
the
inventors
and
performers
of
this
astonishing
drama
were
an
advance
on
the
ben
bunting
type
i
was
of
course
inclined
to
say
no
but
my
tendency
is
to
dislike
changes
and
i
allow
for
it
the
commodore
said
that
in
certain
respects
there
really
was
an
advance
the
seamen
fell
into
few
scrapes
and
they
did
not
get
drunk
so
often
this
was
a
hardy
assertion
of
the
commodore
as
a
good
many
of
them
were
drunk
at
that
moment
i
could
see
myself
that
they
were
better
educated
if
ben
bunting
had
been
asked
who
ajax
and
hercules
were
he
would
have
taken
them
to
be
which
were
so
named
and
his
knowledge
would
have
gone
no
farther
whether
these
tars
of
the
new
era
are
better
sailors
and
braver
and
truer
men
is
another
question
they
understand
their
rights
much
better
if
that
does
any
good
to
them
the
officers
used
to
be
treated
with
respect
at
all
times
and
seasons
this
is
now
qualified
when
they
are
on
duty
the
men
are
as
respectful
as
they
used
to
be
when
they
are
off
duty
the
commodore
himself
is
only
old
h
we
returned
to
the
dockyard
in
a
boat
under
a
full
moon
the
guardship
gleaming
white
in
the
blue
midnight
and
the
phosphorescent
water
flashing
under
the
oars
the
which
was
to
take
me
to
havana
was
off
port
royal
on
the
following
morning
the
commodore
put
me
on
board
in
his
gig
with
the
white
ensign
floating
over
the
stern
i
took
leave
of
him
with
warm
thanks
for
his
own
and
his
family
hospitable
entertainment
of
me
the
screw
went
round
we
steamed
away
out
of
the
harbour
and
jamaica
and
the
kind
friends
whom
i
had
found
there
faded
out
of
sight
jamaica
was
the
last
of
the
english
west
india
islands
which
i
visited
i
was
to
see
it
again
but
i
will
here
set
down
the
impressions
which
had
been
left
upon
me
by
what
i
had
seen
there
and
seen
in
the
antilles
chapter
xvii
present
state
of
jamaica
test
of
progress
resources
of
the
island
political
alternatives
black
supremacy
and
probable
consequences
the
west
indian
problem
as
i
was
stepping
into
the
boat
at
port
royal
a
pamphlet
was
thrust
into
my
hand
which
i
was
entreated
to
read
at
my
leisure
it
was
by
some
discontented
white
of
the
island
no
rare
phenomenon
and
the
subject
of
it
was
the
precipitate
decline
in
the
value
of
property
there
the
writer
unlike
the
planters
insisted
that
the
people
were
taxed
in
proportion
to
their
industry
there
were
taxes
on
mules
on
carts
on
donkeys
all
bearing
on
the
small
black
proprietors
whose
ability
to
cultivate
was
thus
checked
and
who
were
thus
deliberately
encouraged
in
idleness
he
might
have
added
although
he
did
not
that
while
both
in
jamaica
and
trinidad
everyone
is
clamouring
against
the
beetroot
bounty
which
artificially
lowers
the
price
of
sugar
the
local
councils
in
these
two
islands
try
to
counteract
the
effect
and
artificially
raise
the
price
of
sugar
by
an
export
duty
on
their
own
produce
a
singular
method
of
doing
it
which
i
presume
admits
of
explanation
my
pamphleteer
was
persuaded
that
all
the
world
were
fools
and
that
he
and
his
friends
were
the
only
wise
ones
again
a
not
uncommon
occurrence
in
pamphleteers
he
demanded
the
suppression
of
absenteeism
he
demanded
free
trade
in
exchange
for
the
customs
duties
which
were
to
be
abolished
he
demanded
a
land
tax
the
very
mention
of
which
i
had
been
told
by
others
drove
the
black
proprietors
whom
he
wished
to
benefit
into
madness
he
wanted
home
rule
he
wanted
fifty
things
besides
which
i
have
forgotten
but
his
grand
want
of
all
was
a
new
currency
mankind
he
thought
had
been
very
mad
at
all
periods
of
their
history
the
most
significant
illustration
of
their
madness
had
been
the
selection
of
gold
and
silver
as
the
medium
of
exchange
the
true
base
of
the
currency
was
the
land
the
government
of
jamaica
was
to
lend
to
every
freeholder
up
to
the
mortgage
value
of
his
land
in
paper
notes
at
per
cent
interest
the
current
rate
being
at
present
per
cent
the
notes
so
issued
having
the
land
as
their
security
would
be
in
no
danger
of
depreciation
and
they
would
flow
over
the
sugar
estates
like
an
irrigating
stream
on
the
produce
of
sugar
the
fate
of
the
island
depended
on
the
produce
of
sugar
and
why
not
on
the
produce
of
a
fine
race
of
men
the
prospects
of
jamaica
the
prospects
of
all
countries
depend
not
on
sugar
or
on
any
form
or
degree
of
material
wealth
but
on
the
characters
of
the
men
and
women
whom
they
are
breeding
and
rearing
where
there
are
men
and
women
of
a
noble
nature
the
rest
will
go
well
of
itself
where
these
are
not
there
will
be
no
true
prosperity
though
the
sugar
hogsheads
be
raised
from
thousands
into
millions
the
colonies
are
interesting
only
as
offering
homes
where
english
people
can
increase
and
multiply
english
of
the
old
type
with
simple
habits
who
do
not
need
imported
luxuries
there
is
room
even
in
the
west
indies
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
if
they
can
be
contented
to
lead
human
lives
and
do
not
go
there
to
make
fortunes
which
they
are
to
carry
home
with
them
the
time
may
not
be
far
off
when
men
will
be
sick
of
making
fortunes
sick
of
being
ground
to
pattern
in
the
commonplace
of
modern
society
sick
of
a
state
of
things
which
blights
and
kills
simple
and
original
feeling
which
makes
us
think
and
speak
and
act
under
the
tyranny
of
general
opinion
which
masquerades
as
liberty
and
means
only
submission
to
the
newspapers
i
can
conceive
some
modern
men
may
weary
of
all
this
and
retire
from
it
like
the
old
ascetics
not
as
they
did
into
the
wilderness
but
behind
their
own
walls
and
hedges
shutting
out
the
world
and
its
noises
to
inquire
whether
after
all
they
have
really
immortal
souls
and
if
they
have
what
ought
to
be
done
about
them
the
west
india
islands
with
their
inimitable
climate
and
soil
and
prickly
pears
to
make
fences
with
would
be
fine
places
for
such
recluses
failing
these
ideal
personages
there
is
work
enough
of
the
common
sort
to
create
wholesome
prosperity
there
are
oranges
to
be
grown
and
pines
and
plantains
and
coffee
and
cocoa
and
rice
and
indigo
and
tobacco
not
to
speak
of
the
dollars
which
my
american
friend
found
in
the
bamboos
and
of
the
further
dollars
which
other
americans
will
find
in
the
untested
qualities
of
thousands
of
other
productions
here
are
opportunities
for
innocent
industrious
families
where
children
can
be
brought
up
to
be
manly
and
simple
and
true
and
brave
as
their
fathers
were
brought
up
or
as
their
fathers
expressed
it
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lord
while
such
neighbours
as
their
dark
might
have
a
chance
of
a
rise
in
life
in
the
only
sense
in
which
a
can
be
of
real
benefit
to
them
these
are
the
objects
which
statesmen
who
have
the
care
and
conduct
of
a
nation
welfare
ought
to
set
before
themselves
and
unfortunately
they
are
the
last
which
are
remembered
in
countries
which
are
popularly
governed
there
is
a
clamour
for
education
in
such
countries
but
education
means
to
them
only
the
sharpening
of
the
faculties
for
the
competitive
race
which
is
called
progress
in
democracies
no
one
man
is
his
brother
keeper
each
lives
and
struggles
to
make
his
own
way
and
his
own
position
all
that
is
insisted
on
is
that
there
shall
be
a
fair
stage
and
that
every
lad
shall
learn
the
use
of
the
weapons
which
will
enable
him
to
fight
his
own
way
greek
aretê
the
most
essential
of
all
acquisitions
and
the
hardest
to
cultivate
as
aristotle
observed
long
ago
is
assumed
in
democracies
as
a
matter
of
course
of
greek
aretê
a
moderate
quantity
greek
hoposonoun
would
do
and
in
aristotle
opinion
this
was
the
rock
on
which
the
greek
republics
foundered
their
greek
aretê
did
not
come
as
a
matter
of
course
and
they
lost
it
and
the
macedonians
and
the
romans
ate
them
up
from
this
point
of
view
political
problems
and
the
west
indian
among
them
present
unusual
aspects
looking
to
the
west
indies
only
we
took
possession
of
those
islands
when
they
were
of
supreme
importance
in
our
great
wrestle
with
spain
and
france
we
were
fighting
then
for
the
liberties
of
the
human
race
the
spaniards
had
destroyed
the
original
carib
and
indian
inhabitants
we
induced
thousands
of
our
own
to
venture
life
and
fortune
in
the
occupation
of
our
then
vital
conquests
for
two
centuries
we
furnished
them
with
black
servants
whom
we
purchased
on
the
african
coast
and
carried
over
and
sold
there
making
our
own
profits
out
of
the
trade
and
the
colonists
prospered
themselves
and
poured
wealth
and
strength
into
the
empire
of
which
they
were
then
an
integral
part
a
change
passed
over
the
spirit
of
the
age
liberty
assumed
a
new
dress
we
found
slavery
to
be
a
crime
we
released
our
bondmen
we
broke
their
chains
as
we
proudly
described
it
to
ourselves
we
compensated
the
owners
so
far
as
money
could
compensate
for
the
entire
dislocation
of
a
state
of
society
which
we
had
ourselves
created
and
we
trusted
to
the
enchantment
of
liberty
to
create
a
better
in
its
place
we
had
delivered
our
own
souls
we
had
other
colonies
to
take
our
emigrants
other
lands
under
our
open
trade
would
supply
us
with
the
commodities
for
which
we
had
hitherto
been
dependent
on
the
west
indies
they
ceased
to
be
of
commercial
they
ceased
to
be
of
political
moment
to
us
and
we
left
them
to
their
own
resources
the
modern
english
idea
is
that
everyone
must
take
care
of
himself
individuals
or
aggregates
of
individuals
have
the
world
before
them
to
open
the
oyster
or
fail
to
open
it
according
to
their
capabilities
the
state
is
not
to
help
them
the
state
is
not
to
interfere
with
them
unless
for
political
or
party
reasons
it
happens
to
be
convenient
as
we
treat
ourselves
we
treat
our
colonies
those
who
have
gone
thither
have
gone
of
their
own
free
will
and
must
take
the
consequences
of
their
own
actions
we
allow
them
no
executional
privileges
which
we
do
not
claim
for
ourselves
they
must
stand
if
they
are
to
stand
by
their
own
strength
if
they
can
not
stand
they
must
fall
this
is
our
notion
of
education
in
and
for
immediate
purposes
answers
well
enough
individual
enterprise
unendowed
but
unfettered
built
the
main
buttresses
of
the
british
colonial
empire
australians
and
new
zealanders
are
english
and
scotchmen
who
have
settled
at
the
antipodes
where
there
is
more
room
for
them
than
at
home
they
are
the
same
people
as
we
are
and
they
have
the
same
privileges
as
we
have
they
are
parts
of
one
and
the
same
organic
body
as
branches
from
the
original
trunk
the
branch
does
not
part
from
the
trunk
but
it
discharges
its
own
vital
functions
by
its
own
energy
and
we
no
more
desire
to
interfere
than
london
desires
to
interfere
with
manchester
so
it
stands
with
us
where
the
colonists
are
of
our
race
with
the
same
character
and
the
same
objects
and
as
i
said
the
system
answers
under
no
other
relations
could
we
continue
a
united
people
but
it
does
not
answer
it
has
failed
wherever
we
have
tried
it
when
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
countries
of
which
for
one
or
other
reason
we
have
possessed
ourselves
and
of
which
we
keep
possession
are
not
united
to
us
by
any
of
these
natural
bonds
where
they
have
been
annexed
by
violence
or
otherwise
been
forced
under
our
flag
it
has
failed
conspicuously
in
ireland
we
know
that
it
would
fail
in
the
east
indies
if
we
were
rash
enough
to
venture
the
experiment
in
connection
with
the
british
empire
implies
a
desire
or
a
willingness
in
those
who
are
so
left
to
themselves
that
the
connection
shall
continue
we
have
been
so
sanguine
as
to
believe
that
the
privilege
of
being
british
subjects
is
itself
sufficient
to
secure
their
allegiance
that
the
liberties
which
we
concede
will
not
be
used
for
purposes
which
we
are
unable
to
tolerate
that
being
left
to
govern
themselves
they
will
govern
in
harmony
with
english
interests
and
according
to
english
principles
the
privilege
is
not
estimated
so
highly
they
go
their
own
way
and
not
our
way
and
therefore
we
must
look
facts
in
the
face
as
they
are
and
not
as
we
wish
them
to
be
if
we
extend
to
ireland
the
independence
which
only
links
us
closer
to
australia
ireland
will
use
it
to
break
away
from
us
if
we
extend
it
to
bengal
and
madras
and
bombay
we
shall
fling
them
into
anarchy
and
bring
our
empire
to
an
end
we
can
not
for
our
safety
sake
part
with
ireland
we
do
not
mean
to
part
with
our
asiatic
dominions
the
reality
of
the
relation
in
both
cases
is
the
superior
force
of
england
and
we
must
rely
upon
it
and
need
not
try
to
conceal
that
we
do
till
by
the
excellence
of
our
administration
we
have
converted
submission
into
respect
and
respect
into
willingness
for
union
this
may
be
a
long
process
and
a
difficult
one
if
we
choose
to
maintain
our
empire
however
we
must
pay
the
price
for
empire
and
it
is
wiser
better
safer
in
all
cases
to
admit
the
truth
and
act
upon
it
yet
englishmen
so
love
liberty
that
they
struggle
against
confessing
what
is
disagreeable
to
them
many
of
us
would
give
ireland
would
give
india
home
rule
and
run
the
risk
of
what
would
happen
and
only
a
probability
which
reaches
certainty
of
the
consequences
to
be
expected
to
follow
prevents
us
from
unanimously
agreeing
about
the
west
indies
we
do
not
care
very
earnestly
nothing
seriously
alarming
can
happen
there
so
much
therefore
for
the
general
policy
of
leaving
them
to
help
themselves
out
of
their
difficulties
we
have
adopted
completely
the
corollary
that
they
must
govern
themselves
also
on
their
own
responsibilities
we
hesitate
as
yet
to
admit
completely
but
we
do
not
recognise
that
any
responsibility
for
their
failing
condition
rests
on
us
and
the
inclination
certainly
and
perhaps
the
purpose
is
to
throw
them
entirely
upon
themselves
at
the
earliest
moment
cuba
sends
representatives
to
the
cortes
at
madrid
martinique
and
guadaloupe
to
the
assembly
at
paris
in
the
english
islands
being
unwilling
to
govern
without
some
semblance
of
a
constitution
we
try
tentatively
varieties
of
local
boards
and
local
councils
admitting
the
elective
principle
but
not
daring
to
trust
it
fully
creating
hybrid
constitutions
so
contrived
as
to
provoke
ill
feeling
where
none
would
exist
without
them
and
to
make
impossible
any
tolerable
government
which
could
actively
benefit
the
people
we
can
not
intend
that
arrangements
the
effects
of
which
are
visible
so
plainly
in
the
sinking
fortunes
of
our
own
kindred
there
are
to
continue
for
ever
we
suppose
that
we
can
not
go
back
in
these
cases
it
is
to
be
presumed
therefore
that
we
mean
to
go
forward
and
in
doing
so
i
venture
to
think
myself
that
we
shall
be
doing
equal
injustice
both
to
our
own
race
and
to
the
blacks
and
we
shall
bring
the
islands
into
a
condition
which
will
be
a
reproach
and
scandal
to
the
empire
of
which
they
will
remain
a
dishonoured
part
the
slave
trade
was
an
imperial
monopoly
extorted
by
force
guaranteed
by
treaties
and
our
white
west
indian
interest
was
built
up
in
connection
with
and
in
reliance
upon
it
we
had
a
right
to
set
the
slaves
free
but
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
was
no
full
acquittance
of
our
obligations
for
the
condition
of
a
society
which
we
had
ourselves
created
we
have
no
more
right
to
make
the
emancipated
slave
his
master
master
in
virtue
of
his
numbers
than
we
have
a
right
to
lay
under
the
heel
of
the
catholics
of
ireland
the
protestant
minority
whom
we
planted
there
to
assist
us
in
controlling
them
it
may
be
said
that
we
have
no
intention
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
that
no
one
at
present
dreams
of
giving
a
full
colonial
constitution
to
the
west
indian
islands
they
are
allowed
such
freedom
as
they
are
capable
of
using
they
can
be
allowed
more
as
they
are
better
educated
and
more
fit
for
it
one
knows
all
that
and
one
knows
what
it
is
worth
in
the
councils
either
the
nominated
members
are
introduced
merely
as
a
drag
upon
the
wheel
and
are
instructed
to
yield
in
the
end
to
the
demands
of
the
representative
members
or
they
are
themselves
the
representatives
of
the
white
minority
if
the
first
the
majority
rule
already
if
the
second
such
constitutions
are
contrived
ingeniously
to
create
the
largest
amount
of
irritation
and
to
make
impossible
as
long
as
they
last
any
form
of
effective
and
useful
government
therefore
they
can
not
last
and
are
not
meant
to
last
a
principle
once
conceded
develops
with
the
same
certainty
with
which
a
seed
grows
when
it
is
sown
in
the
english
world
as
it
now
stands
there
is
no
middle
alternative
between
and
government
by
the
crown
and
the
cause
of
our
reluctance
to
undertake
direct
charge
of
the
west
indies
is
because
such
undertaking
carries
responsibility
along
with
it
if
they
are
brought
so
close
to
us
we
shall
be
obliged
to
exert
ourselves
and
to
rescue
them
from
a
condition
which
would
be
a
reproach
to
us
the
english
of
those
islands
are
melting
away
that
is
a
fact
to
which
it
is
idle
to
try
to
shut
our
eyes
families
who
have
been
for
generations
on
the
soil
are
selling
their
estates
everywhere
and
are
going
off
lands
once
under
high
cultivation
are
lapsing
into
jungle
professional
men
of
ability
and
ambition
carry
their
talents
to
countries
where
they
are
more
sure
of
reward
every
year
the
census
renews
its
warning
the
rate
may
vary
sometimes
for
a
year
or
two
there
may
seem
to
be
a
pause
in
the
movement
but
it
begins
again
and
is
always
in
the
same
direction
the
white
is
relatively
disappearing
the
black
is
growing
that
is
the
fact
with
which
we
have
to
deal
we
may
say
if
we
please
it
so
then
we
do
not
want
those
islands
let
the
blacks
have
them
poor
devils
they
have
had
wrongs
enough
in
this
world
let
them
take
their
turn
and
have
a
good
time
now
this
i
imagine
is
the
answer
which
will
rise
to
the
lips
of
most
of
us
yet
it
will
be
an
answer
which
will
not
be
for
our
honour
nor
in
the
long
run
for
our
interest
our
stronger
colonies
will
scarcely
attach
more
value
to
their
connection
with
us
if
they
hear
us
declare
impatiently
that
because
part
of
our
possessions
have
ceased
to
be
of
money
value
to
us
we
will
not
or
we
can
not
take
the
trouble
to
provide
them
with
a
decent
government
and
therefore
cast
them
off
nor
in
the
long
run
will
it
benefit
the
blacks
either
the
islands
will
not
be
allowed
to
run
wild
again
and
if
we
leave
them
some
one
else
will
take
them
who
will
be
less
tender
of
his
coloured
brother
sensibilities
we
may
think
that
it
would
not
come
to
that
the
islands
will
still
be
ours
the
english
flag
will
still
float
over
the
forts
the
government
whatever
it
be
will
be
administered
in
the
queen
name
were
it
worth
while
one
might
draw
a
picture
of
the
position
of
an
english
governor
with
a
black
parliament
and
a
black
ministry
recommending
by
advice
of
his
constitutional
ministers
some
measure
like
the
haytian
land
law
no
englishman
not
even
a
bankrupt
peer
would
consent
to
occupy
such
a
position
the
blacks
themselves
would
despise
him
if
he
did
and
if
the
governor
is
to
be
one
of
their
own
race
and
colour
how
long
could
such
a
connection
endure
no
one
i
presume
would
advise
that
the
whites
of
the
island
should
govern
the
relations
between
the
two
populations
are
too
embittered
and
equality
once
established
by
law
the
exclusive
privilege
of
colour
over
colour
can
not
be
restored
while
slavery
continued
the
whites
ruled
effectively
and
economically
the
blacks
are
now
free
as
they
there
are
two
classes
in
the
community
their
interests
are
opposite
as
they
are
now
understood
and
one
can
not
be
trusted
with
control
over
the
other
as
little
can
the
present
order
of
things
continue
the
west
india
islands
once
the
pride
of
our
empire
the
scene
of
our
most
brilliant
achievements
are
passing
away
out
of
our
hands
the
remnant
of
our
own
countrymen
weary
of
an
unavailing
struggle
are
more
and
more
eager
to
withdraw
from
the
scene
because
they
find
no
sympathy
and
no
encouragement
from
home
and
are
forbidden
to
accept
help
from
america
when
help
is
offered
them
while
under
their
eyes
their
quondam
slaves
are
multiplying
thriving
occupying
growing
strong
and
every
day
more
conscious
of
the
changed
order
of
things
one
does
not
grudge
the
black
man
his
prosperity
his
freedom
his
opportunities
of
advancing
himself
one
would
wish
to
see
him
as
free
and
prosperous
as
the
fates
and
his
own
exertions
can
make
him
with
more
and
more
means
of
raising
himself
to
the
white
man
level
but
left
to
himself
and
without
the
white
man
to
lead
him
he
can
never
reach
it
and
if
we
are
not
to
lose
the
islands
altogether
or
if
they
are
not
to
remain
with
us
to
discredit
our
capacity
to
rule
them
it
is
left
to
us
only
to
take
the
same
course
which
we
have
taken
in
the
east
indies
with
such
magnificent
success
and
to
govern
whites
and
blacks
alike
on
the
indian
system
the
circumstances
are
precisely
analogous
we
have
a
population
to
deal
with
the
enormous
majority
of
whom
are
of
an
inferior
race
inferior
i
am
obliged
to
call
them
because
as
yet
and
as
a
body
they
have
shown
no
capacity
to
rise
above
the
condition
of
their
ancestors
except
under
european
laws
european
education
and
european
authority
to
keep
them
from
making
war
on
one
another
they
are
docile
excellent
and
faithful
servants
when
they
are
kindly
treated
but
their
notions
of
right
and
wrong
are
scarcely
even
elementary
their
education
such
as
it
may
be
is
but
skin
deep
and
the
old
african
superstitions
lie
undisturbed
at
the
bottom
of
their
souls
give
them
independence
and
in
a
few
generations
they
will
peel
off
such
civilisation
as
they
have
learnt
as
easily
and
as
willingly
as
their
coats
and
trousers
govern
them
as
we
govern
india
with
the
same
conscientious
care
with
the
same
sense
of
responsibility
with
the
same
impartiality
the
same
disinterested
attention
to
the
of
our
subjects
in
its
highest
and
most
honourable
sense
and
we
shall
give
the
world
one
more
evidence
that
while
englishmen
can
cover
the
waste
places
of
it
with
free
communities
of
their
own
blood
they
can
exert
an
influence
no
less
beneficent
as
the
guides
and
rulers
of
those
who
need
their
assistance
and
whom
fate
and
circumstances
have
assigned
to
their
care
our
kindred
far
away
will
be
more
than
ever
proud
to
form
part
of
a
nation
which
has
done
more
for
freedom
than
any
other
nation
ever
did
yet
is
not
a
slave
to
formulas
and
can
adapt
its
actions
to
the
demands
of
each
community
which
belongs
to
it
the
most
timid
among
us
may
take
courage
for
it
would
cost
us
nothing
save
the
sacrifice
of
a
few
official
traditions
and
an
abstinence
for
the
future
from
doubtful
uses
of
colonial
patronage
the
blacks
will
be
perfectly
happy
when
they
are
satisfied
that
they
have
nothing
to
fear
for
their
persons
or
their
properties
to
the
whites
it
would
be
the
opening
of
a
new
era
of
hope
should
they
be
rash
enough
to
murmur
they
might
then
be
justly
left
to
the
consequences
of
their
own
folly

the

was
very
much
a
mystery
no

was

over

without

the

had
been

how
a

how
the

were
dealing
with
the
trials
which
were
bearing
so
hard
on
our

were
inquiries
worth
making

beyond
these
it

the
founders
of
a
new
era
and
although
the
modern
spaniards
sink
to
the
level
of
the
modern
greeks
their
illustrious
men
will
hold
their
place
for
ever
in
imagination
and
memory
our
own
antilles
had
as
i
have
said
in
their
terror
of
placed
jamaica
under
an
interdict
the
spaniards
at
cuba
were
more
generous
or
more
careless
havana
is
on
the
north
side
of
the
island
facing
towards
florida
thus
in
going
to
it
from
port
royal
we
had
to
round
the
westernmost
cape
and
had
four
days
of
sea
before
us
we
slid
along
the
coast
of
jamaica
in
smooth
water
the
air
while
day
lasted
intensely
hot
but
the
breeze
after
nightfall
blowing
cool
from
off
the
mountains
we
had
a
polite
captain
polite
officers
and
agreeable
two
or
three
cubans
among
them
swarthy
men
spaniards
with
a
difference
with
whom
i
cultivated
a
kind
of
intimacy
in
a
cabin
it
was
reported
that
there
were
again
spanish
ladies
on
their
way
to
the
demonic
gaieties
at
darien
but
they
did
not
show
among
the
rest
of
the
party
was
a
canadian
gentleman
a
exceptionally
and
intelligent
their
american
treaty
having
been
disallowed
the
west
indies
had
proposed
to
negotiate
a
similar
one
with
the
canadian
dominion
the
authorities
at
ottawa
had
sent
m
to
see
if
anything
could
be
done
and
m
was
now
on
his
way
home
not
in
the
best
of
humours
with
our
poor
relations
jamaicans
did
not
know
what
they
wanted
he
said
were
without
spirit
to
help
themselves
they
cried
out
to
others
to
help
them
and
if
all
they
asked
could
not
be
granted
they
clamoured
as
if
the
whole
world
was
combining
to
hurt
them
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
for
these
passionate
appeals
to
the
universe
they
could
not
at
this
moment
perhaps
go
ahead
as
fast
as
some
countries
but
there
was
no
necessity
to
be
always
going
ahead
they
had
a
fine
country
soil
and
climate
all
that
could
be
desired
they
had
all
that
was
required
for
a
quiet
and
easy
life
why
could
they
not
be
contented
and
make
the
best
of
things
unfortunate
jamaicans
the
old
mother
at
home
acts
like
an
unnatural
parent
and
will
neither
help
them
nor
let
their
cousin
jonathan
help
them
they
turn
for
comfort
to
their
big
brother
in
the
north
and
the
big
brother
being
himself
robust
and
healthy
gives
them
wholesome
advice
adventures
do
occasionally
happen
at
sea
even
in
this
age
of
steam
engines
ships
catch
fire
or
run
into
each
other
or
go
on
rocks
in
fogs
or
are
caught
in
hurricanes
and
nature
can
still
assume
her
old
terrors
if
she
pleases
shelley
describes
a
wreck
on
the
coast
of
cornwall
and
the
treacherous
waters
of
the
ocean
in
the
english
channel
now
wild
in
fury
now
smiling
as
on
the
morn
when
the
exulting
elements
in
scorn
satiated
with
destroyed
destruction
lay
sleeping
in
beauty
on
their
mangled
prey
as
panthers
sleep
the
wildest
gale
which
ever
blew
on
british
shores
was
a
mere
summer
breeze
compared
to
a
west
indian
tornado
behind
all
that
beauty
there
lies
the
temper
and
caprice
not
of
a
panther
but
of
a
woman
but
no
tornadoes
fell
in
our
way
nor
anything
else
worth
mentioning
not
even
a
buccaneer
or
a
pirate
we
saw
the
islands
which
these
gentry
haunted
and
the
headlands
made
memorable
by
their
desperate
deeds
but
they
are
gone
even
to
the
remembrance
of
them
what
they
were
and
what
they
did
lies
buried
away
in
book
mausoleums
like
egyptian
mummies
all
as
clean
forgotten
as
if
they
had
been
honest
men
they
and
all
the
wild
scenes
which
these
green
estuaries
have
witnessed
havana
figures
much
in
english
naval
history
drake
tried
to
take
it
and
failed
penn
and
venables
failed
we
stormed
the
forts
in
and
held
them
and
held
the
city
till
the
seven
years
war
was
over
i
had
read
descriptions
of
the
place
but
they
had
given
me
no
clear
conception
of
what
it
would
be
like
certainly
none
at
all
of
what
it
was
like
kingston
is
the
best
of
our
west
indian
towns
and
kingston
has
not
one
fine
building
in
it
havana
is
a
city
of
palaces
a
city
of
streets
and
plazas
of
colonnades
and
towers
and
churches
and
monasteries
we
english
have
built
in
those
islands
as
if
we
were
but
passing
visitors
wanting
only
tenements
to
be
occupied
for
a
time
the
spaniards
built
as
they
built
in
castile
built
with
the
same
material
the
white
limestone
which
they
found
in
the
new
world
as
in
the
old
the
palaces
of
the
nobles
in
havana
the
residence
of
the
governor
the
convents
the
cathedral
are
a
reproduction
of
burgos
or
valladolid
as
if
by
some
aladdin
lamp
a
castilian
city
had
been
taken
up
and
set
down
again
unaltered
on
the
shore
of
the
caribbean
sea
and
they
carried
with
them
their
laws
their
habits
their
institutions
and
their
creed
their
religious
orders
their
bishops
and
their
inquisition
even
now
in
her
day
of
eclipse
when
her
genius
is
clouded
by
the
modern
spirit
against
which
she
fought
so
long
and
so
desperately
the
sons
of
spain
still
build
as
they
used
to
build
and
the
modern
squares
and
market
places
the
castles
and
fortresses
which
have
risen
in
and
round
the
ancient
havana
are
constructed
on
the
old
massive
model
and
on
the
same
lines
however
it
may
be
with
us
and
whatever
the
eventual
fate
of
cuba
the
spanish
race
has
taken
root
there
and
is
visibly
destined
to
remain
they
have
poured
their
own
people
into
it
in
cuba
alone
there
are
ten
times
as
many
spaniards
as
there
are
english
and
scotch
in
all
our
west
indies
together
and
havana
is
ten
times
the
size
of
the
largest
of
our
west
indian
cities
refugees
have
flocked
thither
from
the
revolutions
in
the
peninsula
the
canary
islands
overflow
into
it
you
know
the
people
from
teneriffe
by
their
stature
they
are
the
finest
surviving
specimens
of
the
old
conquering
breed
the
political
future
is
dark
the
government
is
unimaginably
corrupt
so
corrupt
that
change
is
inevitable
though
what
change
it
would
be
idle
to
prophesy
the
americans
looked
at
the
island
which
lay
so
temptingly
near
them
but
they
were
wise
in
their
generation
they
reflected
that
to
introduce
into
an
republic
so
insoluble
an
element
as
a
million
spanish
roman
catholics
alien
in
blood
and
creed
with
half
a
million
blacks
to
swell
the
dusky
flood
which
runs
too
full
among
them
already
would
be
to
invite
an
indigestion
of
serious
consequence
a
few
years
since
the
cubans
born
were
on
the
eve
of
achieving
their
independence
like
their
brothers
in
mexico
and
south
america
perhaps
they
will
yet
succeed
spanish
at
any
rate
they
are
to
the
bone
and
marrow
and
spanish
they
will
continue
the
magnitude
of
havana
and
the
fullness
of
life
which
was
going
on
there
entirely
surprised
me
i
had
thought
of
cuba
as
a
decrepit
state
bankrupt
or
by
civil
wars
and
on
the
edge
of
social
dissolution
and
i
found
havana
at
least
a
grand
imposing
city
a
city
which
might
compare
for
beauty
with
any
in
the
world
the
sanitary
condition
is
as
bad
as
negligence
can
make
it
so
bad
that
a
spanish
gentleman
told
me
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
natural
purity
of
the
air
they
would
have
been
all
dead
like
flies
long
ago
the
tideless
harbour
is
foul
with
the
accumulations
of
three
hundred
years
the
administration
is
more
than
in
spain
itself
if
in
spite
of
this
havana
still
sits
like
a
queen
upon
the
waters
there
are
some
qualities
to
be
found
among
her
people
which
belonged
to
the
countrymen
and
subjects
of
ferdinand
the
catholic
the
coast
line
from
cape
tubiron
has
none
of
the
grand
aspects
of
the
antilles
or
jamaica
instead
of
mountains
and
forests
you
see
a
series
of
undulating
hills
cultivated
with
tolerable
care
and
sprinkled
with
farmhouses
all
the
more
imposing
therefore
from
the
absence
of
marked
natural
forms
are
the
walls
and
towers
of
the
great
moro
the
fortress
which
defends
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
ten
miles
off
it
was
already
a
striking
object
as
we
ran
nearer
it
rose
above
us
stern
proud
and
defiant
upon
a
rock
right
above
the
water
with
high
frowning
bastions
the
lighthouse
at
an
angle
of
it
and
the
spanish
banner
floating
proudly
from
a
turret
which
overlooked
the
whole
the
moro
as
a
fortification
is
i
am
told
indefensible
against
modern
artillery
presenting
too
much
surface
as
a
target
but
it
is
all
the
grander
to
look
at
it
is
a
fine
specimen
of
the
vauban
period
and
is
probably
equal
to
any
demands
which
will
be
made
upon
it
the
harbour
is
something
like
port
royal
a
deep
lagoon
with
a
narrow
entrance
and
a
long
natural
breakwater
between
the
lagoon
and
the
ocean
but
what
at
port
royal
is
a
eight
miles
long
is
at
havana
a
rocky
peninsula
on
which
the
city
itself
is
built
the
opening
from
the
sea
is
half
a
mile
wide
on
the
city
side
there
are
low
semicircular
batteries
which
sweep
completely
the
approaches
and
the
passage
itself
the
moro
rises
opposite
at
the
extreme
point
of
the
entrance
and
next
to
it
farther
in
towards
the
harbour
on
the
same
side
on
the
crest
and
slopes
of
a
range
of
hills
stands
the
old
moro
the
original
castle
which
beat
off
drake
and
oliver
and
which
was
captured
by
the
english
in
the
last
century
the
lines
were
probably
weaker
than
they
are
at
present
and
less
adequately
manned
a
monument
is
erected
there
to
the
officers
and
men
who
fell
in
the
defence
illustration
havana
from
the
quarries
the
city
as
we
steamed
by
looked
singularly
beautiful
with
its
domes
and
steeples
and
marble
palaces
and
glimpses
of
long
boulevards
and
trees
and
handsome
mansions
and
cool
arcades
inside
we
found
ourselves
in
a
basin
perhaps
of
three
miles
diameter
full
of
shipping
of
all
sorts
and
nationalities
the
water
which
outside
is
pure
as
sapphire
has
become
filthy
with
the
pollutions
of
a
dozen
generations
the
tide
which
even
at
the
springs
has
but
a
rise
and
fall
of
a
couple
of
feet
is
totally
ineffective
to
clear
it
and
as
long
as
they
have
the
virgin
mary
to
pray
to
the
pious
spaniards
will
not
drive
their
sewage
into
the
ocean
the
hot
sun
rays
stream
down
into
the
thick
black
liquid
horrible
smells
are
let
loose
from
it
when
it
is
set
in
motion
by
screw
or
paddle
and
ships
bring
up
at
mooring
buoys
lest
their
anchors
should
disturb
the
compost
which
lies
at
the
bottom
yet
one
forgot
the
disagreeables
in
the
novelty
and
striking
character
of
the
scene
a
hundred
boats
were
plying
to
and
fro
among
the
various
vessels
with
their
white
sails
and
white
awnings
flags
of
all
countries
were
blowing
out
at
stern
or
from
masthead
among
them
of
course
the
stars
and
stripes
flying
jauntily
on
some
splendid
schooner
which
stood
there
like
a
cock
upon
a
dunghill
that
might
be
his
own
if
he
chose
to
crow
for
it
as
soon
as
we
had
brought
up
we
were
boarded
by
the
inevitable
hotel
touters
officers
porters
and
boatmen
interpreters
offered
their
services
in
the
confusion
of
languages
gradually
there
emerged
out
of
the
general
noise
two
facts
of
importance
first
that
i
ought
to
have
had
a
passport
and
if
i
had
not
brought
one
that
i
was
likely
to
be
fined
at
the
discretion
of
spanish
officials
secondly
that
if
i
trusted
to
my
own
powers
of
i
should
be
the
victim
of
indefinite
other
extortions
passport
i
had
none
such
things
are
not
required
any
longer
in
spain
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
they
might
still
be
in
demand
in
a
spanish
colony
as
to
being
cheated
no
one
could
or
would
tell
me
what
i
was
to
pay
for
anything
for
there
were
american
dollars
spanish
dollars
mexican
dollars
and
cuban
dollars
all
different
and
there
were
multiples
of
dollars
in
gold
and
single
dollars
in
silver
and
last
and
most
important
of
all
there
was
the
cuban
paper
dollar
which
was
per
cent
below
the
cuban
gold
dollar
and
in
this
last
the
smaller
transactions
of
common
life
were
carried
on
the
practical
part
of
it
to
a
stranger
being
that
when
you
had
to
receive
you
received
in
paper
and
when
you
had
to
pay
you
paid
in
specie
i
escaped
for
the
time
the
penalty
which
would
have
been
inflicted
on
me
about
the
passport
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
of
the
island
and
the
so
the
viceroy
is
called
was
so
formidable
a
person
that
the
officials
did
not
venture
to
meddle
with
me
for
the
rest
i
was
told
that
as
soon
as
i
had
chosen
my
hotel
the
agent
who
was
on
board
would
see
me
through
all
obstructions
and
would
not
allow
me
to
be
plundered
by
anyone
but
himself
to
this
i
had
to
submit
i
named
an
hotel
at
random
a
polite
gentleman
in
a
few
moments
had
a
boat
alongside
for
me
i
had
stept
into
it
when
the
fair
damsels
bound
for
darien
who
had
been
concealed
all
this
time
in
their
cabin
slipped
down
the
ladder
and
took
their
places
at
my
side
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
friends
whom
i
had
left
on
board
and
who
were
watching
us
from
the
deck
at
the
wharf
i
was
able
to
shake
off
my
companions
and
i
soon
forgot
the
misadventure
for
i
found
myself
in
old
castile
once
more
amidst
spanish
faces
spanish
voices
spanish
smells
and
spanish
scenes
on
the
very
wharf
itself
was
a
church
grim
and
stern
and
so
massive
that
it
would
stand
barring
earthquakes
for
a
thousand
years
church
indeed
it
was
no
longer
it
had
been
turned
into
a
but
this
was
because
it
had
been
desecrated
when
we
were
in
havana
by
having
an
english
service
performed
in
it
they
had
churches
enough
without
it
and
they
preferred
to
leave
this
one
with
a
mark
upon
it
of
the
anger
of
the
almighty
of
churches
indeed
there
was
no
lack
churches
thick
as
in
a
welsh
town
church
beyond
church
palace
beyond
palace
the
narrow
streets
where
neighbours
on
either
side
might
shake
hands
out
of
the
upper
stories
the
deep
colonnades
the
private
houses
with
the
windows
grated
towards
the
street
with
glimpses
through
the
street
door
into
the
court
and
garden
within
with
its
cloisters
its
palm
trees
and
its
fountains
the
massiveness
of
the
stonework
the
curious
bookstalls
the
dirt
the
smell
the
carriages
the
swearing
drivers
the
priest
gliding
along
the
footway
it
was
toledo
or
valladolid
again
with
the
sign
manual
on
it
of
spain
herself
in
friendly
and
familiar
form
every
face
that
i
saw
was
spanish
in
kingston
or
port
of
spain
you
meet
fifty
blacks
for
one
european
all
the
manual
work
is
done
by
them
in
havana
the
proportion
is
reversed
you
hardly
see
a
coloured
man
at
all
boatmen
porters
or
every
one
of
whom
are
negroes
in
our
islands
are
there
spaniards
either
cuban
born
or
emigrants
from
home
a
few
black
beggars
there
were
permitted
as
objects
of
charity
to
pious
catholics
and
as
a
sign
of
their
inferiority
of
race
of
poverty
among
the
whites
real
poverty
that
could
be
felt
i
saw
no
sign
at
all
after
driving
for
about
a
mile
we
emerged
out
of
the
old
town
into
a
large
square
and
thence
into
a
wide
alameda
or
boulevard
with
double
avenues
of
trees
statues
fountains
theatres
clubhouses
and
all
the
various
equipments
of
modern
luxuriousness
and
civilised
life
beyond
the
alameda
was
another
still
larger
square
one
side
of
which
was
a
railway
station
and
terminus
in
a
colonnade
at
right
angles
was
the
hotel
to
which
i
had
been
recommended
spacious
handsome
in
style
half
parisian
half
spanish
like
the
fondas
in
the
puerto
del
sol
at
madrid
spanish
was
the
language
generally
spoken
but
there
were
interpreters
and
waiters
more
or
less
accomplished
in
other
tongues
especially
in
english
of
which
they
heard
enough
for
i
found
havana
to
be
the
winter
resort
of
our
american
cousins
who
go
generally
to
cuba
as
we
go
to
the
riviera
to
escape
the
ice
and
winds
of
the
eastern
and
middle
states
this
particular
hotel
was
a
favourite
resort
and
was
full
to
overflowing
with
them
it
was
large
with
an
interior
quadrangular
garden
into
which
looked
tiers
of
windows
and
wings
had
been
thrown
out
with
terraced
roofs
suites
of
rooms
opening
out
upon
them
each
floor
being
provided
with
airy
sitting
rooms
and
music
rooms
here
were
to
be
heard
at
least
a
hundred
american
voices
discussing
the
experiences
and
plans
of
their
owners
the
men
lounged
in
the
hall
or
at
the
bar
or
sat
smoking
on
the
rows
of
leather
chairs
under
the
colonnade
or
were
under
the
hands
of
barbers
or
haircutters
in
an
airy
open
saloon
devoted
to
these
uses
when
i
retreated
upstairs
to
collect
myself
a
lady
was
making
the
corridors
ring
close
by
as
she
screamed
at
a
piano
in
the
middle
of
an
admiring
and
criticising
crowd
dear
as
the
americans
are
to
me
and
welcome
in
most
places
as
is
the
sound
of
those
same
sweet
voices
one
had
not
come
to
havana
for
this
it
was
necessary
to
escape
somewhere
and
promptly
from
the
discord
of
noises
which
i
hoped
might
be
due
to
some
momentary
accident
the
mail
company
agent
r
lived
in
the
hotel
he
kindly
found
me
out
initiated
me
in
the
mysteries
of
cuban
paper
money
and
giving
me
a
tariff
of
the
fares
found
me
a
cab
and
sent
me
out
to
look
about
me
my
first
object
was
the
cathedral
and
the
tomb
of
columbus
in
catholic
cities
in
europe
churches
stand
always
open
the
can
enter
when
he
pleases
fall
on
his
knees
and
say
his
silent
prayers
to
his
master
whom
he
sees
on
the
altar
in
havana
i
discovered
afterward
that
except
at
special
hours
and
those
as
few
as
might
be
the
doors
were
kept
locked
and
could
only
be
opened
by
a
golden
key
it
was
carnival
time
however
there
were
functions
going
on
of
various
kinds
and
i
found
the
cathedral
happily
accessible
it
was
a
vast
building
little
ornamented
but
the
general
forms
severe
and
impressive
in
the
style
of
the
time
of
philip
when
gothic
art
had
gone
out
in
spain
and
there
had
come
in
the
place
of
it
the
implacable
sternness
which
expresses
the
very
genius
of
the
inquisition
a
broad
flight
of
stone
steps
led
up
to
the
great
door
the
afternoon
was
extremely
hot
the
curtains
were
thrown
back
to
admit
as
much
air
as
possible
there
was
some
function
proceeding
of
a
peculiar
kind
i
know
not
what
it
was
something
certainly
in
which
the
public
had
no
interest
for
there
was
not
a
stranger
present
but
myself
but
the
great
cathedral
officials
were
busy
at
work
and
liked
to
be
at
their
ease
on
the
wall
as
you
entered
a
box
invited
contributions
as
por
el
santo
the
service
was
i
know
not
what
in
the
middle
of
the
nave
stood
twelve
large
chairs
arranged
in
a
semicircle
on
these
chairs
sat
twelve
canons
like
a
row
of
mandarins
each
with
his
little
white
patch
like
a
silver
dollar
on
the
crown
of
his
black
head
five
or
six
minor
dignitaries
deacons
precentors
or
something
of
that
sort
were
droning
out
monotonous
recitations
like
the
buzzing
of
so
many
in
the
warm
summer
air
the
dean
or
provost
sat
in
the
central
biggest
chair
of
all
his
face
was
rosy
and
he
wiped
it
from
time
to
time
with
a
red
handkerchief
his
chin
was
double
or
perhaps
treble
he
had
evidently
dined
and
would
or
might
have
slept
but
for
a
pile
of
snuff
on
his
chair
arm
with
continual
refreshments
from
which
he
kept
his
faculties
alive
i
sat
patiently
till
it
was
over
and
the
twelve
holy
men
rose
and
went
their
way
i
could
then
stroll
about
at
leisure
the
pictures
were
of
the
usual
paltry
kind
on
the
chancel
arch
stood
the
royal
arms
of
spain
as
the
lion
and
the
unicorn
used
to
stand
in
our
parish
churches
till
the
high
church
clergy
mistook
them
for
erastian
wild
beasts
at
the
right
side
of
the
altar
was
the
monument
which
i
had
come
in
search
of
a
marble
tablet
fixed
against
the
wall
and
on
it
a
poorly
executed
figure
in
high
relief
with
a
ruff
about
its
neck
and
features
which
might
be
meant
for
anyone
and
for
no
one
in
particular
somewhere
near
me
there
were
lying
i
believed
and
could
hope
the
mortal
remains
of
the
discoverer
of
the
new
world
an
inscription
said
so
there
was
written
o
restos
y
imagen
del
grande
colon
mil
siglos
durad
guardados
en
la
urna
y
en
remembranza
de
nuestra
nacion
the
court
poet
or
whoever
wrote
the
lines
was
as
poor
an
artist
in
verse
as
the
sculptor
in
stone
the
image
of
the
grande
colon
is
certainly
not
in
the
urn
since
you
see
it
on
the
wall
before
your
eyes
the
urn
if
urn
there
be
with
the
in
it
must
be
under
the
floor
columbus
and
his
brother
diego
were
originally
buried
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
altar
in
the
cathedral
of
domingo
when
domingo
was
abandoned
a
commission
was
appointed
to
remove
the
body
of
christophe
to
havana
they
did
remove
body
but
domingo
insists
that
it
was
diego
that
was
taken
away
that
christophe
remains
where
he
was
and
that
if
spain
wants
him
spain
must
pay
for
him
i
followed
the
canons
into
the
sacristy
where
they
were
unrobing
i
did
not
venture
to
address
either
of
themselves
but
i
asked
an
acolyte
if
he
could
throw
any
light
upon
the
matter
he
assured
me
that
there
neither
was
nor
could
have
been
any
mistake
they
had
the
right
body
and
were
in
no
doubt
about
it
in
more
pious
ages
disputes
of
this
sort
were
settled
by
an
appeal
to
miracles
rival
pretenders
for
the
possession
of
the
same
bones
came
however
at
last
to
be
able
to
produce
authentic
proofs
of
miracles
which
had
been
worked
at
more
than
one
of
the
pretended
shrines
so
that
it
was
concluded
that
saints
relics
were
like
the
loaves
and
fishes
capable
of
multiplication
without
losing
their
identity
and
of
having
the
property
of
being
in
several
places
at
the
same
moment
the
same
thing
has
been
alleged
of
the
holy
coat
of
trèves
and
of
the
wood
of
the
true
cross
havana
and
domingo
may
perhaps
eventually
find
a
similar
solution
of
their
disagreement
over
the
resting
place
of
columbus
i
walked
back
to
my
hotel
up
a
narrow
shady
street
like
a
long
arcade
here
were
the
principal
shops
several
libraries
among
them
into
which
i
strayed
to
gossip
and
to
look
over
the
shelves
that
so
many
persons
could
get
a
living
by
bookselling
implied
a
reading
population
but
the
books
themselves
did
not
indicate
any
present
literary
productiveness
they
were
chiefly
old
and
from
the
old
world
and
belonged
probably
to
persons
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
late
rebellion
and
whose
property
had
been
confiscated
they
were
absurdly
cheap
i
bought
a
copy
of
guzman
de
alfarache
for
a
few
pence
i
had
brought
letters
of
introduction
to
several
distinguished
people
in
havana
to
one
especially
don
g
a
member
of
a
noble
peninsular
family
once
an
officer
in
the
spanish
navy
now
chairman
of
a
railway
company
and
head
of
an
important
commercial
house
his
elder
brother
the
marques
de
called
on
me
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
my
arrival
a
man
of
forty
or
thereabouts
with
courteous
manners
rapid
prompt
and
incisive
with
the
air
of
a
soldier
which
in
early
life
he
had
been
he
had
travelled
spoke
various
languages
and
spoke
to
me
in
admirable
english
don
g
who
might
be
a
year
or
two
younger
came
later
and
stayed
an
hour
and
a
half
with
me
let
me
acknowledge
here
and
in
as
warm
language
as
i
can
express
it
the
obligations
under
which
i
stand
to
him
not
for
the
personal
attentions
only
which
he
showed
me
during
my
stay
in
havana
but
for
giving
me
an
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
a
real
specimen
of
plato
superior
men
who
were
now
and
then
so
plato
said
to
be
met
with
in
foreign
travel
it
is
to
him
that
i
owe
any
knowledge
which
i
brought
away
with
me
of
the
present
state
of
cuba
he
had
seen
much
thought
much
read
much
he
was
on
a
level
with
the
latest
phases
of
philosophical
and
spiritual
speculation
could
talk
of
darwin
and
spencer
of
schopenhauer
of
strauss
and
of
renan
aware
of
what
they
had
done
aware
of
the
inconvenient
truths
which
they
had
forced
into
light
but
aware
also
that
they
had
left
the
most
important
questions
pretty
much
where
they
found
them
he
had
taken
no
part
in
the
political
troubles
of
the
late
years
in
cuba
but
he
had
observed
everything
no
one
knew
better
the
defects
of
the
present
system
of
government
no
one
was
less
ready
to
rush
into
hasty
schemes
for
violently
mending
it
the
ten
years
rebellion
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
and
knew
so
little
he
first
made
intelligible
to
me
cuba
had
been
governed
as
a
province
of
spain
and
spain
like
other
mother
countries
had
thought
more
of
drawing
a
revenue
out
of
it
for
herself
than
of
the
interests
of
the
colony
spanish
officials
had
been
avaricious
and
spanish
fiscal
policy
oppressive
and
ruinous
the
resources
of
the
island
in
metals
in
minerals
in
agriculture
were
as
yet
hardly
scratched
yet
every
attempt
to
develop
them
was
paralysed
by
fresh
taxation
the
rebellion
had
been
an
effort
of
the
cuban
spaniards
precisely
analogous
to
the
revolt
of
our
own
north
american
colonies
to
shake
off
the
authority
of
the
court
of
madrid
and
to
make
themselves
independent
they
had
fought
desperately
and
had
for
several
years
been
masters
of
half
the
island
they
had
counted
on
help
from
the
united
states
and
at
one
time
they
seemed
likely
to
get
it
but
the
americans
could
not
see
their
way
to
admitting
cuba
into
the
union
and
without
such
a
prospect
did
not
care
to
quarrel
with
spain
on
their
account
finding
that
they
were
to
be
left
to
themselves
the
insurgents
came
to
terms
and
spanish
authority
was
families
had
been
divided
sons
taking
one
side
and
fathers
the
other
as
in
our
english
wars
of
the
roses
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
to
save
the
family
estates
whichever
side
came
out
victorious
the
blacks
had
been
indifferent
the
rebellion
having
no
interest
for
them
at
all
they
had
remained
by
their
masters
and
they
had
been
rewarded
after
the
peace
by
complete
emancipation
there
was
not
a
slave
now
in
cuba
no
indemnity
had
been
granted
to
their
owners
nor
had
any
been
asked
for
and
the
business
on
the
plantations
had
gone
on
without
interruption
those
who
had
been
slaves
continued
to
work
at
the
same
locations
receiving
wages
instead
of
food
and
maintenance
all
were
satisfied
at
the
change
and
this
remarkable
revolution
had
been
carried
out
with
an
ease
and
completeness
which
found
no
parallel
in
any
other
country
in
spite
of
rebellion
in
spite
of
the
breaking
up
and
reconstruction
of
the
social
system
in
spite
of
the
indifferent
administration
of
justice
in
spite
of
taxation
and
the
inexplicable
appropriation
of
the
revenue
cuba
was
still
moderately
prosperous
and
that
it
could
flourish
at
all
after
trials
so
severe
was
the
best
evidence
of
the
greatness
of
its
natural
wealth
the
party
of
insurrection
was
dissolved
and
would
revive
again
only
under
the
unlikely
contingency
of
encouragement
from
the
united
states
there
was
a
party
however
which
desired
for
cuba
a
constitution
like
the
canadian
home
rule
and
the
management
of
its
own
affairs
and
as
the
black
element
was
far
outnumbered
and
under
control
such
a
constitution
would
not
be
politically
dangerous
if
the
spanish
government
does
not
mend
its
ways
concessions
of
this
kind
may
eventually
have
to
be
made
though
the
improvement
to
be
expected
from
it
is
doubtful
official
corruption
is
engrained
in
the
character
and
habits
of
the
spanish
people
judges
allowed
their
decisions
to
be
under
philip
iii
as
much
as
in
the
colonies
of
queen
christina
and
when
a
fault
is
the
habit
of
a
people
it
survives
political
reforms
and
any
number
of
turnings
of
the
kaleidoscope
the
encouraging
feature
is
the
success
of
emancipation
there
is
no
jealousy
no
race
animosity
no
supercilious
contempt
of
whites
for
the
spaniards
have
inherited
a
tinge
of
colour
themselves
from
their
african
ancestors
and
thus
they
are
all
friends
together
the
liberated
slave
can
acquire
and
own
land
if
he
wishes
for
it
but
as
a
rule
he
prefers
to
work
for
wages
these
happy
conditions
arise
in
part
from
the
spanish
temperament
but
chiefly
from
the
numerical
preponderance
of
the
white
element
which
as
in
the
united
states
is
too
secure
to
be
uneasy
the
black
is
not
encouraged
in
insubordination
by
a
sense
that
he
could
win
in
a
contest
of
strength
and
the
aspect
of
things
is
far
more
promising
for
the
future
than
in
our
own
islands
the
spaniards
however
inferior
we
may
think
them
to
ourselves
have
filled
their
colonies
with
their
own
people
and
are
reaping
the
reward
of
it
we
have
so
contrived
that
such
english
as
had
settled
in
the
west
indies
on
their
own
account
are
leaving
them
spain
four
centuries
ago
was
the
greatest
of
european
nations
the
first
in
art
or
second
only
to
italy
the
first
in
arms
the
first
in
the
men
whom
she
produced
she
has
been
swept
along
in
the
current
of
time
she
fought
against
the
stream
of
tendency
and
the
stream
proved
too
strong
for
her
great
as
she
was
the
modern
spirit
which
she
would
not
have
when
it
came
in
the
shape
of
the
reformation
has
flowed
over
her
borders
as
revolution
not
to
her
benefit
for
she
is
unable
to
assimilate
the
new
ideas
the
old
spain
of
the
inquisition
is
gone
the
spain
of
is
divided
between
liberalism
and
catholic
belief
she
is
sick
in
the
process
of
the
change
and
neither
she
nor
her
colonies
stand
any
longer
in
the
front
lines
in
the
race
of
civilisation
yet
the
print
of
her
foot
is
stamped
on
the
new
world
in
characters
which
will
not
be
effaced
and
may
be
found
to
be
as
enduring
as
our
own
the
colony
is
perhaps
in
advance
of
the
mother
country
the
catholic
church
don
g
said
has
little
influence
in
cuba
has
had
no
rival
he
explained
so
has
grown
lazy
i
judged
the
same
from
my
own
observations
the
churches
on
sundays
were
thinly
attended
and
men
smiled
when
i
asked
them
about
i
inquired
about
famous
preachers
i
was
told
that
there
was
no
preaching
in
havana
famous
or
otherwise
i
might
if
i
was
lucky
and
chose
to
go
there
in
the
early
morning
hear
a
sermon
in
the
church
of
the
jesuits
that
was
all
i
went
i
heard
my
jesuit
who
was
fluent
eloquent
and
gesticulating
but
he
was
pouring
out
his
passionate
rhetoric
to
about
fifty
women
with
scarcely
a
man
amongst
them
it
was
piteous
to
look
at
him
the
catholic
church
whether
it
be
for
want
of
rivals
or
merely
from
force
of
time
has
fallen
from
its
high
estate
it
can
burn
no
more
heretics
for
it
has
lost
the
art
to
raise
conviction
to
sufficient
intensity
the
power
to
burn
was
the
measure
of
the
real
belief
which
people
had
in
the
church
and
its
doctrines
the
power
has
departed
with
the
waning
of
faith
and
religion
in
havana
as
in
madrid
is
but
and
wont
not
but
opinion
and
opinion
which
is
half
insincere
nothing
else
can
take
its
place
the
day
is
too
late
for
protestantism
which
has
developed
into
wider
forms
and
in
the
matter
of
satisfied
and
complete
religious
conviction
protestants
are
hardly
better
off
than
catholics
don
g
had
been
much
in
spain
he
was
acquainted
with
many
of
the
descendants
of
the
old
aristocracy
who
lingered
there
in
faded
grandeur
he
had
studied
the
history
of
his
own
country
he
compared
the
spain
and
england
of
the
sixteenth
century
with
the
spain
and
england
of
the
present
and
like
most
of
us
he
knew
where
the
yoke
galled
his
own
neck
but
economical
and
political
prosperity
is
no
exhaustive
measure
of
human
progress
the
rome
of
trajan
was
immeasurably
more
splendid
than
the
rome
of
the
scipios
yet
the
progress
had
been
downwards
nevertheless
if
the
object
of
our
existence
on
this
planet
is
the
development
of
character
if
the
culminating
point
in
any
history
be
that
at
which
it
produces
its
noblest
and
bravest
men
facts
do
not
tend
to
assure
us
that
the
triumphant
march
of
the
last
hundred
years
is
accomplishing
much
in
that
direction
i
found
myself
arguing
with
don
g
that
if
charles
and
philip
ii
were
to
come
back
to
this
world
and
to
see
whither
the
movement
had
brought
us
of
which
they
had
worked
so
hard
to
suppress
the
beginning
they
would
still
say
that
they
had
done
right
in
trying
to
strangle
it
the
reformation
called
itself
a
protest
against
lies
and
the
advocates
of
it
imagined
that
when
the
lies
or
what
they
called
such
were
cleared
away
the
pure
metal
of
christianity
would
remain
unsullied
the
great
men
who
fought
against
the
movement
charles
in
his
cabinet
and
erasmus
in
his
closet
had
seen
that
it
could
not
rest
there
that
it
was
the
cradle
of
a
revolution
in
which
the
whole
spiritual
and
political
organisation
of
europe
would
be
flung
into
the
crucible
under
that
organisation
human
nature
had
ascended
to
altitudes
of
chivalry
of
which
it
had
never
before
reached
the
sixteenth
century
was
the
blossoming
time
of
the
old
world
and
no
such
men
had
appeared
since
as
then
came
to
the
front
either
in
spain
or
italy
or
germany
or
france
or
england
the
actual
leaders
of
the
reformation
had
been
bred
in
the
system
which
they
destroyed
puritanism
and
calvinism
produced
men
of
powerful
character
but
they
were
limited
and
incapable
of
continuance
and
now
the
liberty
which
was
demanded
had
become
what
the
instinct
of
the
great
emperor
had
told
him
from
the
first
must
be
the
final
shape
of
it
a
revolution
which
would
tolerate
no
inequalities
of
culture
or
position
which
insisted
that
no
man
was
better
than
another
which
was
to
exalt
the
low
and
bring
down
the
high
till
all
mankind
should
stand
upon
a
common
level
a
level
not
of
baseness
or
badness
but
a
level
of
smart
vulgar
and
vulgarising
mediocrity
with
melodrama
for
tragedy
farce
for
comedy
sounding
speech
for
statesmanlike
wisdom
and
for
a
creed
when
our
fathers
thought
that
we
had
been
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
the
more
modest
knowledge
that
we
were
only
a
little
higher
than
the
apes
this
was
the
aspect
in
which
the
world
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
appear
to
sir
thomas
more
or
the
duke
of
alva
from
the
grand
captain
to
señor
castelar
from
lord
burghley
to
gladstone
from
leonardo
da
vinci
or
velasquez
to
gustave
doré
from
cervantes
and
shakespeare
to
and
the
at
home
from
the
faith
which
built
the
cathedrals
to
evolution
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
from
the
carving
and
architecture
of
the
middle
ages
to
the
workmanship
of
the
modern
contractor
the
change
in
the
spiritual
department
of
things
had
been
the
same
along
the
whole
line
charles
after
seeing
all
that
has
been
achieved
the
railways
the
steam
engines
the
telegraphs
the
yankee
and
his
united
states
which
are
the
embodiment
of
the
highest
aspirations
of
the
modern
era
after
attending
a
session
of
the
british
association
itself
and
seeing
the
bishops
holding
out
their
hands
to
science
which
had
done
such
great
things
for
them
might
fairly
claim
that
it
was
a
doubtful
point
whether
the
change
had
been
really
for
the
better
it
may
be
answered
and
answered
truly
that
the
old
thing
was
dead
the
catholic
faith
where
it
was
left
standing
and
where
it
still
stands
produces
now
nothing
higher
nothing
better
than
the
protestant
human
systems
grow
as
trees
grow
the
seed
shoots
up
the
trunk
forms
the
branches
spread
leaves
and
flowers
and
fruit
come
out
year
after
year
as
if
they
were
able
to
renew
themselves
for
ever
but
that
which
has
a
beginning
has
an
end
that
which
has
life
must
die
when
the
vital
force
is
exhausted
the
faith
of
more
as
well
as
the
faith
of
ken
or
wilson
were
elevating
and
ennobling
as
long
as
they
were
sincerely
believed
but
the
time
came
when
they
became
clouded
with
uncertainty
and
confused
perplexed
and
honestly
anxious
humanity
struggles
on
as
well
as
it
can
all
things
considered
respectably
enough
in
its
chrysalis
condition
the
old
wings
gone
the
new
wings
that
are
to
be
if
we
are
ever
to
have
another
set
as
yet
imprisoned
in
their
sheath
the
same
sunday
morning
when
i
went
in
search
of
my
sermon
the
hotel
was
alive
as
bees
at
swarming
time
there
was
to
be
a
bull
fight
in
honour
of
the
carnival
and
such
a
bull
fight
as
had
never
been
seen
in
havana
placards
on
the
wall
announced
that
a
lady
from
spain
gloriana
they
called
her
was
to
meet
and
slay
a
bull
in
single
combat
and
everyone
must
go
and
see
the
wonderful
sight
i
myself
having
seen
the
real
thing
in
madrid
many
years
ago
felt
no
more
curiosity
and
that
a
woman
should
be
an
actress
in
such
a
scene
did
not
revive
it
to
those
who
went
the
performance
was
a
disappointment
the
bull
provided
turned
out
to
be
a
calf
of
tender
years
the
spectators
insisted
that
they
would
have
a
mature
beast
of
strength
and
ferocity
and
gloriana
when
brought
to
the
point
declined
the
adventure
there
was
a
prettier
scene
in
the
evening
in
the
cool
after
nightfall
the
beauty
and
fashion
of
havana
turns
out
to
stroll
in
the
illuminated
alameda
as
it
was
now
a
high
festival
the
band
was
to
play
and
the
crowd
was
as
dense
as
on
exhibition
nights
at
south
kensington
the
music
was
equally
good
and
the
women
as
graceful
and
well
dressed
i
sat
for
an
hour
or
two
listening
under
the
statue
of
poor
queen
isabella
the
image
of
her
still
stands
where
it
was
placed
though
revolution
has
long
shaken
her
from
her
throne
all
is
forgotten
now
except
that
she
was
once
a
spanish
sovereign
and
time
and
distance
have
deodorised

was

and
much
to

about
i
regretted
only
that
i
had
not
been
better
advised
in
my
choice
of
an
hotel
the
dining
saloon
rang
with
american
voices
in
their
shrillest
tones
every
table
was
occupied
by
groups
of
them
nor
was
there
a
sound
in
the
room
of
any
language
but
theirs
in
the
whole
company
i
had
not
a
single
acquaintance
i
have
liked
well
almost
every
individual
american
that
i
have
fallen
in
with
and
come
to
know
they
are
frank
friendly
open
and
absolutely
unaffected
and
like
my
friend
at
miss
roy
in
jamaica
they
take
cheerful
views
of
life
which
is
the
highest
of
all
recommendations
the
distinctness
and
sharpness
of
utterance
is
tolerable
and
even
agreeable
in
conversation
with
a
single
person
when
a
large
number
of
them
are
together
all
talking
in
a
high
tone
it
tries
the
nerves
and
sets
the
teeth
on
edge
nor
could
i
escape
from
them
in
any
part
of
the
building
the
gentlemen
were
talking
politics
in
the
hall
or
lounging
under
the
colonnade
one
of
them
an
absolute
stranger
who
perhaps
knew
who
i
was
asked
me
abruptly
for
my
opinion
of
cardinal
newman
the
ladies
filled
the
sitting
rooms
their
pianos
and
their
duets
pierced
the
walls
of
my
bedroom
and
only
ceased
an
hour
after
midnight
at
five
in
the
morning
the
engines
began
to
scream
at
the
adjoining
railway
station
the
church
bells
woke
at
the
same
hour
with
their
superfluous
summons
to
matins
which
no
one
attended
sleep
was
next
to
an
impossibility
under
these
hard
conditions
and
i
wanted
more
and
not
less
of
it
when
i
had
the
duties
upon
me
of
sightseeing
sleep
or
no
sleep
however
i
determined
that
i
would
see
what
i
could
as
long
as
i
could
keep
going
a
few
hundred
yards
off
was
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
havana
cigar
manufactories
a
courteous
message
from
the
manager
señor
bances
had
informed
me
that
he
would
be
happy
to
show
me
over
it
on
any
morning
before
the
sun
was
above
the
roofs
of
the
houses
i
found
the
señor
a
handsome
elderly
gentleman
tall
and
lean
with
castilian
dignity
of
manner
free
and
frank
in
all
his
communications
with
no
reserve
concealments
or
insincerities
i
told
him
that
in
my
experience
cigars
were
not
what
they
had
been
that
the
last
good
one
which
i
had
smoked
i
had
bought
twenty
years
ago
from
a
at
madrid
i
had
come
to
havana
to
see
whether
i
could
find
another
equally
good
at
the
fountain
head
he
said
that
he
was
not
at
all
surprised
it
was
the
same
story
as
at
jamaica
the
consumption
of
cigars
had
increased
with
extreme
rapidity
the
area
on
which
the
finest
tobacco
had
been
grown
was
limited
and
the
expense
of
growing
it
was
very
great
only
a
small
quantity
of
the
best
cigars
was
now
made
for
the
market
in
general
the
plants
were
heavily
manured
and
the
flavour
suffered
leaf
of
coarse
fibre
was
used
for
the
core
of
the
cigars
with
only
a
fold
or
two
wrapped
round
it
of
more
delicate
quality
he
took
me
into
the
different
rooms
where
the
manufacture
was
going
on
in
the
first
were
perhaps
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
young
men
engaged
in
rolling
they
were
all
cubans
or
spaniards
with
the
exception
of
a
single
negro
and
all
i
should
think
under
thirty
on
each
of
the
tables
was
one
of
the
names
with
which
we
have
grown
familiar
in
modern
cigar
shops
reynas
regalias
principes
and
i
know
not
how
many
else
the
difference
of
material
could
not
be
great
but
there
was
a
real
difference
in
the
fineness
of
the
make
and
in
the
quality
of
the
exterior
leaf
the
workmen
were
of
unequal
capacity
and
were
unequally
paid
the
señor
employed
in
all
about
at
least
so
i
understood
him
the
black
field
hands
had
eighteenpence
a
day
the
rollers
were
paid
by
quality
and
quantity
a
good
workman
doing
his
best
could
earn
sixty
dollars
a
week
an
idle
and
indifferent
one
about
twelve
they
smoked
as
they
rolled
and
there
was
no
check
upon
the
consumption
the
loss
in
this
way
being
estimated
at
dollars
a
year
the
pay
was
high
but
there
was
another
side
to
it
the
occupation
was
dangerous
if
there
were
no
boys
in
the
room
there
were
no
old
men
those
who
undertook
it
died
often
in
two
or
three
years
doubtless
with
precaution
the
mortality
might
be
diminished
but
like
the
needle
and
the
scissor
grinders
in
england
the
men
themselves
do
not
wish
it
to
be
diminished
the
risk
enters
into
the
wages
and
they
prefer
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
the
cigarettes
of
which
the
varieties
are
as
many
as
there
are
of
cigars
were
made
exclusively
by
chinese
the
second
room
which
we
entered
was
full
of
them
their
curious
yellow
faces
mildly
bending
over
their
tobacco
heaps
of
these
there
may
have
been
a
hundred
of
the
general
expenses
of
the
establishment
i
do
not
venture
to
say
anything
bewildered
as
i
was
in
the
labyrinthine
complication
of
the
currency
but
it
must
certainly
be
enormous
and
this
house
the
partagas
was
but
one
of
many
equally
extensive
in
havana
alone
the
señor
was
most
liberal
he
filled
my
pockets
with
packets
of
excellent
cigarettes
he
gave
me
a
bundle
of
cigars
i
can
not
say
whether
they
were
equal
to
what
i
bought
from
my
for
these
may
have
been
idealised
by
a
grateful
memory
but
they
were
so
incomparably
better
than
any
which
i
have
been
able
to
get
in
london
that
i
was
tempted
to
deal
with
him
and
so
far
i
have
had
no
reason
to
repent
the
boxes
with
which
he
provided
me
bettered
the
sample
and
the
price
duty
at
home
included
was
a
third
below
what
i
should
have
paid
in
london
for
an
article
which
i
would
rather
leave
unconsumed
a
broker
whom
i
fell
in
with
insisted
to
me
that
the
best
cigars
all
went
to
london
that
my
preference
for
what
i
got
from
my
señor
was
mere
fancy
and
vanity
and
that
i
could
buy
better
in
any
shop
in
regent
street
i
said
that
he
might
but
i
could
and
so
we
left
it
i
tell
all
this
not
with
the
affectation
of
supposing
that
tobacco
or
my
own
taste
about
it
can
have
any
interest
but
as
an
illustration
of
what
can
be
done
in
the
west
indies
and
to
show
how
immense
a
form
of
industry
waits
to
be
developed
in
our
own
islands
if
people
with
capital
and
knowledge
choose
to
set
about
it
tobacco
as
good
as
the
best
in
cuba
has
been
grown
and
can
be
grown
in
jamaica
in
domingo
and
probably
in
every
one
of
the
antilles
are
dollars
in
those
islands
as
my
yankee
said
and
many
a
buried
treasure
will
be
brought
to
light
there
when
capitalists
can
feel
assured
that
they
will
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
black
constitutional
governments
my
letter
of
introduction
to
the
was
still
undelivered
and
as
i
had
made
use
of
it
on
landing
i
thought
it
right
at
least
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
great
man
the
marques
m
kindly
consented
to
go
with
me
and
help
me
through
the
interview
being
of
course
acquainted
with
him
he
was
at
his
country
house
a
mile
out
of
the
town
the
buildings
are
all
good
in
havana
it
was
what
it
called
itself
not
a
palace
but
a
handsome
country
residence
in
the
middle
of
a
large
garden
the
viceroyalty
has
a
fair
but
not
extravagant
income
attached
to
it
the
receives
about
a
year
besides
allowances
were
the
balls
and
dinners
expected
of
him
which
our
poor
governors
are
obliged
to
entertain
their
subjects
with
he
would
not
be
able
to
make
much
out
of
it
the
large
fortunes
which
used
to
be
brought
back
by
the
fortunate
who
could
connive
at
the
slave
trade
were
no
longer
attainable
those
good
days
are
gone
public
opinion
therefore
permits
them
to
save
their
incomes
the
spaniards
are
not
a
hospitable
people
or
rather
their
notion
of
hospitality
differs
in
form
from
ours
they
are
ready
to
dine
with
you
themselves
as
often
as
you
will
ask
them
nothing
in
the
shape
of
dinners
is
looked
for
from
the
and
when
i
as
a
stranger
suggested
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
as
an
invitation
happening
to
me
my
companion
assured
me
that
i
need
not
be
in
the
least
alarmed
we
were
introduced
into
a
hall
with
a
few
marble
busts
in
it
and
casts
of
greek
and
roman
statues
and
general
officers
were
lounging
about
with
whom
we
exchanged
distant
civilities
after
waiting
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
summoned
by
an
official
into
an
adjoining
room
and
found
ourselves
in
his
excellency
presence
he
was
a
small
man
out
of
uniform
in
plain
morning
dress
with
a
silk
sash
he
received
us
with
natural
politeness
cordiality
was
uncalled
for
but
he
was
perfectly
gracious
he
expressed
his
pleasure
at
seeing
me
in
the
island
he
hoped
that
i
should
enjoy
myself
and
on
his
part
would
do
everything
in
his
power
to
make
my
stay
agreeable
he
spoke
of
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
and
of
the
social
state
of
the
island
with
pardonable
satisfaction
enquired
about
our
own
west
indies
and
finally
asked
me
to
tell
him
in
what
way
he
could
be
of
service
to
me
i
told
him
that
i
had
found
such
kind
friends
in
havana
already
that
i
could
think
of
little
one
thing
only
he
could
do
if
he
pleased
i
had
omitted
to
bring
a
passport
with
me
not
knowing
that
it
would
be
required
my
position
was
irregular
and
might
be
inconvenient
i
was
indebted
to
my
letter
of
introduction
to
his
excellency
for
admission
into
his
dominions
perhaps
he
would
write
a
few
words
which
would
enable
me
to
remain
in
them
and
go
out
of
them
when
my
visit
was
over
his
excellency
said
that
he
would
instruct
the
gobierno
civil
to
see
to
it
an
instruction
the
meaning
of
which
i
too
sadly
understood
i
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
escape
the
fine
a
fresh
shower
followed
of
polite
words
and
with
these
we
took
ourselves
away
the
afternoon
was
spent
more
instructively
perhaps
more
agreeably
in
a
different
scene
the
marques
m
had
been
a
pupil
of
the
jesuits
he
had
personal
friends
in
the
jesuit
college
at
havana
especially
one
father
viñez
whose
name
is
familiar
to
students
of
meteorological
science
and
who
has
supplemented
and
corrected
the
accepted
law
of
storms
by
careful
observation
of
west
indian
hurricanes
the
jesuits
were
as
well
spoken
of
in
havana
as
the
moravians
in
jamaica
everyone
had
a
good
word
for
them
they
alone
as
i
have
said
took
the
trouble
to
provide
the
good
people
there
with
a
sermon
on
sundays
they
alone
among
the
catholic
clergy
though
they
live
poorly
and
have
no
endowment
exert
themselves
to
provide
a
tolerable
education
for
the
middle
and
upper
classes
the
marques
undertook
that
if
we
called
we
should
be
graciously
received
and
i
was
curious
and
interested
their
college
had
been
an
enormous
monastery
wherever
the
spaniards
went
they
took
an
army
of
monks
with
them
of
all
the
orders
the
monks
contrived
always
to
house
themselves
handsomely
while
soldiers
fought
and
settlers
planted
the
monks
duty
was
to
pray
in
process
of
time
it
came
to
be
doubted
whether
the
monks
prayers
were
worth
what
they
cost
or
whether
in
fact
they
had
ever
had
much
effect
of
any
kind
they
have
been
suppressed
in
spain
they
have
been
clipped
short
in
all
the
spanish
dominions
and
in
havana
there
are
now
left
only
a
handful
of
dominicans
a
few
nuns
and
these
jesuits
who
have
taken
possession
of
the
largest
of
the
convents
much
as
a
becomes
the
vigorous
tenant
of
the
shell
of
some
lazy
they
have
a
college
there
where
there
are
four
hundred
lads
and
young
men
who
pay
for
their
education
some
hundreds
more
are
taken
out
of
charity
the
jesuits
conduct
the
whole
and
do
it
all
unaided
on
their
own
resources
and
this
is
far
from
all
that
they
do
they
keep
on
a
level
with
the
age
they
are
men
of
learning
they
are
men
of
science
they
are
the
royal
society
of
cuba
they
have
an
observatory
in
the
college
and
the
father
viñez
of
whom
i
have
spoken
is
in
charge
of
it
father
viñez
was
our
particular
object
the
porter
lodge
opened
into
a
courtyard
like
the
quadrangle
of
a
college
at
oxford
from
the
courtyard
we
turned
into
a
narrow
staircase
up
which
we
climbed
till
we
reached
the
roof
on
and
under
which
the
father
had
his
lodgings
and
his
observing
machinery
we
entered
a
small
room
plainly
furnished
with
a
table
and
a
few
uncushioned
chairs
tables
and
chairs
all
save
the
father
littered
with
books
and
papers
cases
stood
round
the
wall
containing
instruments
of
the
most
advanced
modern
type
each
with
its
paper
barrel
unrolling
slowly
under
clockwork
while
a
pencil
noted
upon
it
the
temperature
of
the
air
the
atmospheric
pressure
the
degree
of
moisture
the
ozone
the
electricity
in
the
middle
surrounded
by
his
tools
and
his
ticking
clocks
sat
the
father
lean
and
dry
with
shrivelled
skin
and
brown
threadbare
frock
he
received
my
companion
with
a
warm
affectionate
smile
the
marques
told
him
that
i
was
an
englishman
who
was
curious
about
the
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
he
spoke
to
me
at
once
with
the
politeness
of
a
man
of
sense
after
a
few
questions
asked
and
answered
he
took
us
out
to
a
shed
among
the
where
he
kept
his
large
telescope
his
equatorial
and
his
transit
instruments
not
on
the
great
scale
of
observatories
but
with
everything
which
was
really
essential
he
had
a
laboratory
too
and
a
workshop
with
all
the
recent
appliances
he
was
a
practical
optician
and
mechanic
he
managed
and
repaired
his
own
machinery
observed
made
his
notes
and
wrote
his
reports
to
the
societies
with
which
he
was
in
correspondence
all
by
himself
the
outfit
of
such
an
establishment
even
on
a
moderate
scale
is
expensive
i
said
i
supposed
that
the
government
gave
him
a
grant
far
from
it
he
said
we
have
to
pay
a
duty
on
every
instrument
which
we
import
then
pays
for
it
all
i
asked
order
he
answered
quite
simply
the
house
i
believe
a
gift
though
it
cost
the
state
nothing
having
been
simply
seized
when
the
monks
were
expelled
the
order
now
maintains
it
and
more
than
repays
the
government
for
their
single
act
of
generosity
at
my
companion
suggestion
father
viñez
gave
me
a
copy
of
his
book
on
hurricanes
it
contains
a
record
of
laborious
journeys
which
he
made
to
the
scene
of
the
devastations
of
the
last
ten
years
the
scientific
value
of
the
father
work
is
recognised
by
the
highest
authorities
though
i
can
not
venture
even
to
attempt
to
explain
what
he
has
done
he
then
conducted
us
over
the
building
and
showed
us
the
libraries
dormitories
playgrounds
and
the
other
arrangements
which
were
made
for
the
students
of
these
we
saw
none
they
were
all
out
but
the
long
tables
in
the
refectory
were
laid
for
afternoon
tea
there
was
a
cup
of
milk
for
each
lad
with
a
plate
of
honey
and
a
roll
of
bread
and
supper
would
follow
in
the
evening
the
sleeping
gallery
was
divided
into
cells
open
at
the
top
for
ventilation
with
bed
table
chest
of
drawers
and
washing
apparatus
all
scrupulously
clean
so
far
as
i
could
judge
the
fathers
cared
more
for
the
boys
comfort
than
for
their
own
through
an
open
door
our
conductor
faintly
indicated
the
apartment
which
belonged
to
himself
four
bare
walls
a
bare
tiled
floor
a
plain
pallet
with
a
crucifix
above
the
pillow
was
all
that
it
contained
there
was
no
parade
of
ecclesiasticism
the
libraries
were
well
furnished
but
the
books
were
chiefly
secular
and
scientific
the
chapel
was
unornamented
there
were
a
few
pictures
but
they
were
simple
and
inoffensive
everything
was
good
of
its
kind
down
to
the
gymnastic
courts
and
swimming
bath
the
holiness
was
kept
in
the
back
ground
it
was
in
the
spirit
and
not
in
the
body
the
cost
of
the
whole
establishment
was
defrayed
out
of
the
payments
of
the
richer
students
managed
economically
for
the
benefit
of
the
rest
with
complete
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
fathers
to
indulgence
and
pleasures
of
their
own
as
we
took
leave
the
marques
kissed
his
old
master
brown
hand
i
rather
envied
him
the
privilege
something
i
saw
of
havana
society
in
the
received
sense
of
the
word
there
are
many
clubs
there
and
high
play
in
most
of
them
for
the
cubans
are
given
to
the
roulette
tables
the
union
club
which
is
the
most
distinguished
among
them
invites
occasional
strangers
staying
in
the
city
to
temporary
membership
as
we
do
at
the
athenæum
here
you
meet
spanish
who
have
come
to
cuba
to
be
out
of
reach
of
revolution
proud
as
ever
and
not
as
poor
as
you
might
expect
and
when
you
ask
who
they
are
you
hear
the
great
familiar
names
of
spanish
history
i
was
introduced
to
the
president
young
handsome
and
accomplished
i
was
startled
to
learn
that
he
was
the
head
of
the
old
house
of
sandoval
the
house
of
columbus
ought
to
be
there
also
for
there
is
still
a
christophe
colon
the
direct
linear
representative
of
the
discoverer
disguised
under
the
title
of
the
duque
de
veragua
a
perpetual
pension
of
dollars
a
year
was
granted
to
the
great
christophe
and
his
heirs
for
ever
as
a
charge
on
the
cuban
revenue
it
has
been
paid
to
the
family
through
all
changes
of
dynasty
and
forms
of
government
and
is
paid
to
them
still
but
the
duque
resides
in
spain
and
the
present
occupation
of
him
i
was
informed
is
the
breeding
and
raising
bulls
for
the
plaza
de
toros
at
seville
thus
every
way
my
stay
was
made
agreeable
to
me
there
were
breakfasts
and
dinners
and
introductions
don
g
and
his
brother
were
not
fine
gentlemen
only
but
were
men
of
business
and
deeply
engaged
in
the
active
life
of
the
place
the
american
consul
was
a
conspicuous
figure
at
these
entertainments
america
may
not
find
it
her
interest
to
annex
these
islands
but
since
she
ordered
the
french
out
of
mexico
and
the
french
obeyed
she
is
universally
felt
on
that
side
of
the
atlantic
to
be
the
supreme
arbiter
of
all
their
fates
her
consuls
are
thus
persons
of
consequence
the
cubans
like
the
americans
well
the
commercial
treaty
which
was
offered
to
our
islands
by
the
united
states
would
have
been
accepted
eagerly
by
the
spaniards
to
them
the
americans
have
as
yet
not
been
equally
liberal
but
an
arrangement
will
soon
be
completed
they
say
that
they
have
hills
of
solid
iron
in
the
island
and
mountains
of
copper
with
fifty
per
cent
of
virgin
ore
in
them
waiting
for
the
americans
to
develop
the
present
administration
would
swallow
up
in
taxation
the
profits
of
the
most
promising
enterprise
that
ever
was
undertaken
but
the
metals
are
there
and
will
come
one
day
into
working
the
consul
was
a
swift
peremptory
man
who
knew
his
own
mind
at
any
rate
between
his
sir
and
his
sir
you
were
at
no
loss
for
his
meaning
he
told
me
a
story
of
a
officer
with
whom
he
had
once
got
into
conversation
at
hayti
he
had
inquired
why
they
let
so
fine
an
island
run
to
waste
why
did
they
not
cultivate
it
the
dusky
soldier
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
and
waved
his
hand
he
said
might
do
for
english
or
germans
or
americans
we
of
the
latin
race
have
higher
things
to
occupy
us
i
liked
the
consul
well
i
could
not
say
as
much
for
his
countrymen
and
countrywomen
at
my
hotel
individually
i
dare
say
they
would
have
been
charming
collectively
they
drove
me
to
distraction
space
and
time
had
no
existence
for
them
they
and
their
voices
were
heard
in
all
places
and
at
all
hours
the
midnight
bravuras
at
the
pianos
mixed
wildly
in
my
broken
dreams
the
marques
m
wished
to
take
me
with
him
to
his
country
seat
and
show
me
his
sugar
plantations
nothing
could
have
been
more
delightful
but
with
want
of
sleep
and
the
constant
racket
i
found
myself
becoming
unwell
in
youth
and
strength
one
can
defy
the
foul
fiend
and
bid
him
do
his
worst
in
age
one
finds
it
wiser
to
get
out
of
the
way
on
the
sea
seven
miles
from
havana
and
connected
with
it
by
a
convenient
railway
at
a
place
called
vedado
i
found
a
lodging
house
kept
by
a
frenchman
the
best
cook
in
cuba
with
a
german
wife
the
situation
was
so
attractive
and
the
owners
of
it
so
attentive
that
quiet
people
went
often
into
there
there
were
delicious
rooms
airy
and
solitary
as
i
could
wish
the
sea
washed
the
coral
rock
under
the
windows
there
were
walks
wild
as
if
there
was
no
city
within
a
thousand
miles
up
the
banks
of
lonely
rivers
over
open
moors
or
among
inclosures
where
there
were
large
farming
establishments
with
cattle
and
horses
and
extensive
stables
and
sheds
there
was
a
village
and
a
harbour
where
fishing
people
kept
their
boats
and
went
out
daily
with
their
nets
and
lines
blacks
and
whites
living
and
working
side
by
side
i
could
go
where
i
pleased
without
fear
of
interference
or
question
only
i
was
warned
to
be
careful
of
the
dogs
large
and
dangerous
descendants
of
the
famous
cuban
bloodhounds
which
are
kept
everywhere
to
guard
the
yards
and
houses
these
beasts
were
really
dangerous
and
had
to
be
avoided
the
shore
was
of
inexhaustible
interest
it
was
a
level
shelf
of
coral
rock
extending
for
many
miles
and
littered
over
with
shells
and
coral
branches
which
had
been
flung
up
by
the
surf
i
had
hoped
for
bathing
in
the
open
water
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
on
account
of
the
sharks
but
baths
have
been
cut
in
the
rock
all
along
that
part
of
the
coast
at
intervals
of
half
a
mile
deep
square
basins
with
tunnels
connecting
them
with
the
sea
up
which
the
waves
run
clear
and
foaming
they
are
within
inclosures
roofed
over
to
keep
out
the
sun
and
with
attendants
regularly
present
art
and
nature
combined
never
made
more
charming
pools
the
water
clear
as
sapphire
aerated
by
the
constant
inrush
of
the
foaming
breakers
and
so
warm
that
you
could
lie
in
it
without
a
chill
for
hours
alas
that
i
could
but
look
at
them
and
execrate
the
precious
government
which
forbade
me
their
use
so
severe
a
tax
is
laid
on
these
bathing
establishments
that
the
owners
can
only
afford
to
keep
them
open
during
the
three
hottest
months
in
the
year
when
the
demand
is
greatest
in
the
evenings
people
from
havana
would
occasionally
come
down
to
dine
as
we
go
to
greenwich
being
attracted
partly
by
the
air
and
partly
by
my
host
reputation
there
was
a
long
verandah
under
which
tables
were
laid
out
and
there
were
few
nights
on
which
one
or
more
parties
were
not
to
be
seen
there
thus
i
encountered
several
curious
specimens
of
cuban
humanity
and
on
one
of
my
runs
up
to
havana
i
met
again
the
cigar
broker
who
had
so
roughly
challenged
my
judgment
he
was
an
original
and
rather
diverting
man
i
should
think
a
jew
whatever
he
was
he
fell
upon
me
again
and
asked
me
scornfully
whether
i
supposed
that
the
cigars
which
i
had
bought
of
señor
bances
were
anything
out
of
the
way
i
said
that
they
suited
my
taste
and
that
was
enough
he
replied
loco
con
su
every
fool
had
his
opinion
am
the
idiot
then
said
i
that
again
is
matter
of
opinion
he
spoke
of
cuba
and
professed
to
know
all
about
it
you
tell
me
then
said
i
the
cubans
hate
the
spaniards
do
the
irish
hate
the
english
he
answered
i
said
it
was
not
an
analogous
case
cubans
and
spaniards
were
of
the
same
breed
and
of
the
same
creed
is
nothing
he
replied
americans
will
have
both
cuba
and
ireland
before
long
i
said
i
thought
the
americans
were
too
wise
to
meddle
with
either
if
they
did
however
i
imagined
that
on
our
own
side
of
the
atlantic
we
should
have
something
to
say
on
the
subject
before
ireland
was
taken
from
us
he
laughed
it
possible
sir
he
said
you
live
in
england
and
are
so
absolutely
ignorant
i
laughed
too
he
was
a
strange
creature
and
would
have
made
an
excellent
character
in
a
novel
don
g
or
his
brother
came
down
occasionally
to
see
how
i
was
getting
on
and
to
talk
philosophy
and
history
other
gentlemen
came
and
the
favourite
subject
of
conversation
was
spanish
administration
one
of
them
told
me
this
story
as
an
illustration
of
it
his
father
was
the
chief
partner
in
a
bank
a
clerk
absconded
taking
dollars
with
him
he
had
been
himself
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
man
overtook
him
with
the
money
still
in
his
possession
and
recovered
it
with
this
he
ought
to
have
been
contented
but
he
tried
to
have
the
offender
punished
the
clerk
replied
to
the
criminal
charge
by
a
against
the
house
it
was
absurd
in
itself
but
he
found
that
a
suit
would
grow
out
of
it
which
would
swallow
more
than
the
dollars
and
finally
he
bribed
the
judge
to
allow
him
to
drop
the
prosecution
de
it
lies
in
the
breed
guzman
de
alfarache
was
robbed
of
his
baggage
by
a
friend
the
facts
were
clear
the
thief
was
caught
with
guzman
clothes
on
his
back
but
he
had
influential
friends
he
was
acquitted
he
prosecuted
guzman
for
a
false
accusation
got
a
judgment
and
ruined
him
the
question
was
whether
if
the
cubans
could
make
themselves
independent
there
would
be
much
improvement
the
want
in
cuba
just
now
as
in
a
good
many
other
places
is
the
want
of
some
practical
religion
which
insists
on
moral
duty
a
learned
english
judge
was
trying
a
case
one
day
when
there
seemed
some
doubt
about
the
religious
condition
of
one
of
the
witnesses
the
clerk
of
the
court
retired
with
him
to
ascertain
what
it
really
was
and
returned
radiant
almost
immediately
saying
right
my
lord
knows
he
be
damned
competent
witness
knows
he
be
damned
that
is
really
the
whole
of
the
matter
if
a
man
is
convinced
that
if
he
does
wrong
he
will
infallibly
be
punished
for
it
he
has
then
saving
faith
this
unfortunately
is
precisely
the
conviction
which
modern
forms
of
religion
produce
hardly
anywhere
the
cubans
are
catholics
and
hear
mass
and
go
to
confession
but
confession
and
the
mass
between
them
are
enough
for
the
consciences
of
most
of
them
and
those
who
think
are
under
the
influence
of
the
modern
spirit
to
which
all
things
are
doubtful
some
find
comfort
in
herbert
spencer
some
regard
christianity
as
a
myth
or
poem
which
had
passed
in
unconscious
good
faith
into
the
mind
of
mankind
and
there
might
have
remained
undisturbed
as
a
beneficent
superstition
had
not
protestantism
sprung
up
and
insisted
on
flinging
away
everything
which
was
not
literal
and
historical
fact
historical
fact
had
really
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
with
the
stories
of
prometheus
or
the
siege
of
troy
the
end
was
that
no
bottom
of
fact
could
be
found
and
we
were
all
set
drifting
notably
too
i
observed
among
serious
people
there
what
i
have
observed
in
other
places
the
visible
relief
with
which
they
begin
to
look
forward
to
extinction
after
death
when
the
authority
is
shaken
on
which
the
belief
in
a
future
life
rests
the
question
inevitably
recurs
men
used
to
pretend
that
the
idea
of
annihilation
was
horrible
to
them
now
they
regard
the
probability
of
it
with
calmness
if
not
with
actual
satisfaction
one
very
interesting
cuban
gentleman
said
to
me
that
life
would
be
very
tolerable
if
one
was
certain
that
death
would
be
the
end
of
it
the
theological
alternatives
were
equally
unattractive
tartarus
was
an
eternity
of
misery
and
the
elysian
fields
an
eternity
of
ennui
there
is
affectation
in
the
talk
of
men
and
one
never
knows
from
what
they
say
exactly
what
is
in
their
mind
i
have
often
thought
that
the
real
character
of
a
people
shows
itself
nowhere
with
more
unconscious
completeness
than
in
their
cemeteries
philosophise
as
we
may
few
of
us
are
deliberately
insincere
in
the
presence
of
death
and
in
the
arrangements
which
we
make
for
the
reception
of
those
who
have
been
dear
to
us
and
in
the
lines
which
we
inscribe
upon
their
monuments
we
show
what
we
are
in
ourselves
perhaps
more
than
what
they
were
whom
we
commemorate
the
parish
churchyard
is
an
emblem
and
epitome
of
english
country
life
london
reflects
itself
in
brompton
and
kensal

and

in

la
chaise
one
day
as
i
was
walking
i
found
myself
at
the
gate
of
the
great
suburban
cemetery
of
havana
it
was
enclosed
within
high
walls
the
gateway
was
a
vast
arch
of
brown
marble
beautiful
and
elaborately
carved
within
there
was
a
garden
simply
and
gracefully
laid
out
with
trees
and
shrubs
and
flowers
in
borders
the
whole
space
inclosed
may
have
been
ten
acres
of
which
half
was
assigned
to
those
who
were
contented
with
a
mere
mound
of
earth
to
mark
where
they
lay
the
rest
was
divided
into
family
vaults
covered
with
large
white
marble
slabs
separate
headstones
marking
individuals
for
whom
a
particular
record
was
required
and
each
group
bearing
the
name
of
the
family
the
members
of
which
were
sleeping
there
the
peculiarity
of
the
place
was
the
absence
of
inscriptions
there
was
a
name
and
date
with
paz
descansa
or
gracia
está
and
that
seemed
all
that
was
needed
the
virtues
of
the
departed
and
the
grief
of
the
survivors
were
taken
for
granted
in
all
but
two
instances
there
may
have
been
more
but
i
could
find
only
these
one
was
in
latin
ad
coelites
evocatæ
uxori
eximæ
ignatius
to
his
admirable
wife
who
has
been
called
up
to
the
other
was
in
spanish
verse
and
struck
me
as
a
graceful
imitation
of
the
old
manner
of
cervantes
and
lope
de
vega
the
design
on
the
monument
was
of
a
girl
hanging
an
immortelle
upon
a
cross
the
tomb
was
of
a
caridad
del
monte
and
the
lines
were
bendita
caridad
las
que
piadosa
su
mano
vierte
en
la
funérea
losa
son
flores
recogidas
en
el
suelo
mas
con
su
olor
perfumaián
el
cielo
it
is
dangerous
for
anyone
to
whom
a
language
is
only
moderately
familiar
to
attempt
an
appreciation
of
elegiac
poetry
the
effect
of
which
like
the
fragrance
of
a
violet
must
rather
be
perceived
than
accounted
for
he
may
imagine
what
is
not
there
for
a
single
word
ill
placed
or
ill
chosen
may
spoil
the
charm
and
of
this
a
foreigner
can
never
entirely
judge
he
may
know
what
each
word
means
but
he
can
not
know
the
associations
of
it
here
however
is
a
translation
in
which
the
sense
is
preserved
though
the
aroma
is
gone
the
flowers
which
thou
oh
blessed
charity
with
pious
hand
hast
twined
in
funeral
wreath
although
on
earthly
soil
they
gathered
be
will
sweeten
heaven
with
their
perfumed
breath
the
flowers
i
suppose
were
the
actions
of
caridad
own
innocent
life
which
she
was
offering
on
the
cross
of
christ
but
one
never
can
be
sure
that
one
has
caught
the
exact
sentiment
of
emotional
verse
in
a
foreign
language
the
beauty
lies
in
an
undefinable
sweetness
which
rises
from
the
melody
of
the
words
and
in
a
translation
disappears
altogether
who
or
what
caridad
del
monte
was
whether
a
young
girl
whom
somebody
had
loved
or
an
allegoric
and
emblematic
figure
i
had
no
one
to
tell
me
i
must
not
omit
one
acquaintance
which
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
make
while
staying
at
my
seaside
lodging
there
appeared
there
one
day
driven
out
of
havana
like
myself
by
the
noise
an
american
ecclesiastic
with
a
friend
who
addressed
him
as
lord
by
the
ring
and
purple
as
well
as
by
the
title
i
perceived
that
he
was
a
bishop
his
friend
was
his
chaplain
and
from
their
voices
i
gathered
that
they
were
both
by
extraction
irish
the
bishop
had
what
is
called
a
throat
and
had
come
from
the
states
in
search
of
a
warmer
climate
they
kept
entirely
to
themselves
but
from
the
laughter
and
they
were
evidently
excellent
company
for
one
another
and
wanted
no
other
i
rather
wished
than
hoped
that
accident
might
introduce
me
to
them
even
in
cuba
the
weather
is
uncertain
one
day
there
came
a
high
wind
from
the
sea
the
waves
roared
superbly
upon
the
rocks
flying
over
them
in
rolling
cataracts
i
never
saw
foam
so
purely
white
or
waves
so
transparent
as
a
spectacle
it
was
beautiful
and
the
shore
became
a
museum
of
coralline
curiosities
indoors
the
effect
was
less
agreeable
windows
rattled
and
shutters
broke
from
their
fastenings
and
flew
to
and
fro
the
weathercock
on
the
creaked
as
he
was
whirled
about
and
the
verandahs
had
to
be
closed
and
the
noise
was
like
a
prolonged
thunder
peal
the
second
day
the
wind
became
a
cyclone
and
chilly
as
if
it
came
from
the
pole
none
of
us
could
stir
out
the
bishop
suffered
even
more
than
i
did
he
walked
up
and
down
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
house
wrapped
in
a
huge
episcopalian
cloak
i
think
he
saw
that
i
was
sorry
for
him
as
i
really
was
he
spoke
to
me
he
said
he
had
felt
the
cold
less
in
america
when
the
thermometer
marked
below
zero
it
was
not
much
but
the
silence
was
broken
common
suffering
made
a
kind
of
link
between
us
after
this
he
dropped
an
occasional
gracious
word
as
he
passed
and
one
morning
he
came
and
sat
by
me
and
began
to
talk
on
subjects
of
extreme
interest
chiefly
he
insisted
on
the
rights
of
conscience
and
the
tenderness
for
liberty
of
thought
which
had
always
been
shown
by
the
church
of
rome
he
had
been
led
to
speak
of
it
by
the
education
question
which
has
now
become
a
burning
one
in
the
american
union
the
church
he
said
never
had
interfered
and
never
could
or
would
interfere
with
any
man
conscientious
scruples
its
own
scruples
therefore
ought
to
be
respected
the
american
state
schools
were
irreligious
and
catholic
parents
were
unwilling
to
allow
their
children
to
attend
them
they
had
established
schools
of
their
own
and
they
supported
them
by
subscriptions
among
themselves
in
these
schools
the
boys
and
girls
learnt
everything
which
they
could
learn
in
the
state
schools
and
they
learnt
to
be
virtuous
besides
they
were
thus
discharging
to
the
full
every
duty
which
the
state
could
claim
of
them
and
the
state
had
no
right
to
tax
them
in
addition
for
the
maintenance
of
institutions
of
which
they
made
no
use
and
of
the
principles
of
which
they
disapproved
there
were
now
eight
millions
of
catholics
in
the
union
in
more
than
one
state
they
had
an
actual
majority
and
they
intended
to
insist
that
as
long
as
their
children
came
up
to
the
present
educational
standard
they
should
no
longer
be
compelled
to
pay
a
second
education
tax
to
the
government
the
struggle
he
admitted
would
be
a
severe
one
but
the
catholics
had
justice
on
their
side
and
would
fight
on
till
they
won
in
democracies
the
majority
is
to
prevail
and
if
the
control
of
education
falls
within
the
province
of
each
separate
state
government
it
is
not
easy
to
see
on
what
ground
the
americans
will
be
able
to
resist
or
how
there
can
be
a
struggle
at
all
where
the
catholic
vote
is
really
the
largest
the
presence
of
the
catholic
church
in
a
democracy
is
the
real
anomaly
the
principle
of
the
church
is
authority
resting
on
a
divine
commission
the
principle
of
democracy
is
the
will
of
the
people
and
the
church
in
the
long
run
will
have
as
hard
a
battle
to
fight
with
the
divine
right
of
the
majority
of
numbers
as
she
had
with
the
divine
right
of
the
hohenstauffens
and
the
plantagenets
she
is
adroit
in
adapting
herself
to
circumstances
and
like
her
emblem
the
fish
she
changes
her
colour
with
that
of
the
element
in
which
she
swims
no
doubt
she
has
a
strong
position
in
this
demand
and
will
know
how
to
use
it
but
i
was
surprised
to
hear
even
a
catholic
bishop
insist
that
his
church
had
always
paid
so
much
respect
to
the
rights
of
conscience
i
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
in
the
days
of
its
power
the
church
had
not
been
particularly
tender
towards
differences
of
opinion
fire
and
sword
had
been
used
freely
enough
as
long
as
fire
and
sword
were
available
i
hinted
my
astonishment
the
bishop
said
the
church
had
been
slandered
the
church
had
never
in
a
single
instance
punished
any
man
merely
for
conscientious
error
protestants
had
falsified
history
protestants
read
their
histories
catholics
read
theirs
and
the
catholic
version
was
the
true
one
the
separate
governments
of
europe
had
no
doubt
been
cruel
in
france
spain
the
low
countries
even
in
england
heretics
had
been
harshly
dealt
with
but
it
was
the
governments
that
had
burnt
and
massacred
all
those
people
not
the
church
the
governments
were
afraid
of
heresy
because
it
led
to
revolution
the
church
had
never
shed
any
blood
at
all
the
church
could
not
for
she
was
forbidden
to
do
so
by
her
own
canons
if
she
found
a
man
obstinate
in
unbelief
she
cut
him
off
from
the
communion
and
handed
him
over
to
the
secular
arm
if
the
secular
arm
thought
fit
to
kill
him
the
church
hands
were
clear
of
it
illustration
port
au
prince
hayti
so
pilate
washed
his
hands
so
the
judge
might
say
he
never
hanged
a
murderer
the
execution
was
the
work
of
the
hangman
the
bishop
defied
me
to
produce
an
instance
in
which
in
rome
when
the
temporal
power
was
with
the
pope
and
the
civil
magistrates
were
churchmen
there
had
ever
been
an
execution
for
heresy
i
mentioned
giordano
bruno
whom
the
bishop
had
forgotten
but
we
agreed
not
to
quarrel
and
i
could
not
admire
sufficiently
the
hardihood
and
the
ingenuity
of
his
argument
the
english
bishops
and
abbots
passed
through
parliament
the
act
hæretico
but
they
were
acting
as
politicians
not
as
churchmen
the
spanish
inquisition
burnt
freely
and
successfully
the
inquisitors
were
archbishops
and
bishops
but
the
holy
office
was
a
function
of
the
state
when
gregory
xiii
struck
his
medal
in
commemoration
of
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
he
was
then
only
the
secular
ruler
of
rome
and
therefore
fallible
and
subject
to
sin
like
other
mortals
the
church
has
many
parts
to
play
her
stage
wardrobe
is
well
furnished
and
her
actors
so
well
instructed
in
their
parts
that
they
believe
themselves
in
all
that
they
say
the
bishop
was
speaking
no
more
than
his
exact
conviction
he
told
me
that
in
the
middle
ages
secular
princes
were
bound
by
their
coronation
oath
to
accept
the
pope
as
the
arbiter
of
all
quarrels
between
them
i
asked
where
this
oath
was
or
what
were
the
terms
of
it
the
words
he
said
were
unimportant
the
fact
was
certain
and
down
to
the
fatal
schism
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
pope
had
always
been
allowed
to
arbitrate
and
quarrels
had
been
prevented
i
could
but
listen
and
wonder
he
admitted
that
he
had
read
one
set
of
books
and
i
another
as
it
was
clear
that
he
must
have
done
in
the
midst
of
our
differences
we
found
we
had
many
points
of
agreement
we
agreed
that
the
breaking
down
of
church
authority
at
the
reformation
had
been
a
fatal
disaster
that
without
a
sense
of
responsibility
to
a
supernatural
power
human
beings
would
sink
into
ingenious
apes
that
human
society
would
become
no
more
than
a
congregation
of
apes
and
that
with
differences
of
opinion
and
belief
that
sense
was
becoming
more
and
more
obscured
so
long
as
all
serious
men
held
the
same
convictions
and
those
convictions
were
embodied
in
the
law
religion
could
speak
with
authority
the
authority
being
denied
or
shaken
the
fact
itself
became
uncertain
the
notion
that
everybody
had
a
right
to
think
as
he
pleased
was
felt
to
be
absurd
in
common
things
in
every
practical
art
or
science
the
ignorant
submitted
to
be
guided
by
those
who
were
better
instructed
than
themselves
why
should
they
be
left
to
their
private
judgment
on
subjects
where
to
go
wrong
was
the
more
dangerous
all
this
was
plain
sailing
the
corollary
that
if
it
is
to
retain
its
influence
the
church
must
not
teach
doctrines
which
outrage
the
common
sense
of
mankind
as
luther
led
half
europe
to
believe
that
the
church
was
doing
in
the
sixteenth
century
we
agreed
that
we
would
not
dispute
about
but
i
was
interested
to
see
that
the
leopard
had
not
changed
its
spots
that
it
merely
readjusted
its
attitudes
to
suit
the
modern
taste
and
that
if
it
ever
recovered
its
power
it
would
claw
and
scratch
in
the
old
way
rome
like
pilate
may
protest
its
innocence
of
the
blood
which
was
spilt
in
its
name
and
in
its
interests
did
that
tender
and
merciful
court
ever
suggest
to
those
prelates
who
passed
the
act
in
england
for
the
burning
of
heretics
that
they
were
transgressing
the
sacred
rights
of

it
reprove
the

the
air
and
quiet
of
vedado
so
my
retreat
was
called
soon
set
me
up
again
and
i
was
able
to
face
once
more
my
hotel
and
its
americans
i
did
not
attempt
to
travel
in
cuba
nor
was
it
necessary
for
my
purpose
i
stayed
a
few
days
longer
at
havana
i
went
to
operas
and
churches
i
sailed
about
the
harbour
in
boats
the
boatmen
all
of
them
not
negroes
as
in
the
antilles
but
emigrants
from
the
old
country
chiefly
gallicians
i
met
people
of
all
sorts
among
the
rest
a
spanish
officer
a
major
of
engineers
who
if
he
lives
may
come
to
something
major
d
took
me
over
the
fortifications
showed
me
the
interior
lines
of
the
moro
and
their
latest
specimens
of
modern
artillery
the
garrison
are
of
course
spanish
regiments
made
of
castilians
as
i
could
not
fail
to
recognise
when
i
heard
any
of
them
speak
there
are
certain
words
of
common
use
in
spain
powerful
as
the
magic
formulas
of
enchanters
over
the
souls
of
men
you
hear
them
everywhere
in
the
peninsula
at
cafe
at
tables
and
in
private
conversation
they
are
a
part
of
the
national
intellectual
equipment
either
from
prudery
or
because
they
are
superior
to
superstitions
the
cubans
have
washed
these
expressions
out
of
their
language
but
the
national
characteristics
are
preserved
in
the
army
and
the
spell
does
not
lose
its
efficacy
because
the
islanders
disbelieve
in
it
i
have
known
a
closed
post
office
in
madrid
where
the
clerk
was
deaf
to
polite
entreaty
blown
open
by
an
oath
as
by
a
bomb
shell
a
squad
of
recruits
in
the
moro
who
were
lying
in
the
shade
under
a
tree
neglected
to
rise
as
an
officer
went
by
c
o
he
thundered
out
and
they
bounded
to
their
feet
as
if
electrified
on
the
whole
havana
was
something
to
have
seen
it
is
the
focus
and
epitome
of
spanish
dominion
in
those
seas
and
i
was
forced
to
conclude
that
it
was
well
for
cuba
that
the
english
attempts
to
take
possession
of
it
had
failed
be
the
faults
of
their
administration
as
heavy
as
they
are
alleged
to
be
the
spaniards
have
done
more
to
europeanise
their
islands
than
we
have
done
with
ours
they
have
made
cuba
spanish
trinidad
dominica
lucia
grenada
have
never
been
english
at
all
and
jamaica
and
barbadoes
are
ceasing
to
be
english
cuba
is
a
second
home
to
the
spaniards
a
permanent
addition
to
their
soil
we
are
as
birds
of
passage
temporary
residents
for
transient
purposes
with
no
home
in
our
islands
at
all
once
we
thought
them
worth
fighting
for
and
as
long
as
it
was
a
question
of
ships
and
cannon
we
made
ourselves
supreme
rulers
of
the
caribbean
sea
yet
the
french
and
spaniards
will
probably
outlive
us
there
they
will
remain
perhaps
as
satellites
of
the
united
states
or
in
some
other
confederacy
or
in
recovered
strength
of
their
own
we
in
a
generation
or
two
if
the
causes
now
in
operation
continue
to
work
as
they
are
now
working
shall
have
disappeared
from
the
scene
in
cuba
there
is
a
great
spanish
population
martinique
and
guadaloupe
are
parts
of
france
to
us
it
seems
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
we
keep
our
islands
or
abandon
them
and
we
leave
the
remnants
of
our
once
precious
settlements
to
float
or
drown
as
they
can
australia
and
canada
take
care
of
themselves
we
expect
our
west
indies
to
do
the
same
careless
of
the
difference
of
circumstance
we
no
longer
talk
of
cutting
our
colonies
adrift
the
tone
of
public
opinion
is
changed
and
no
one
dares
to
advocate
openly
the
desertion
of
the
least
important
of
them
but
the
neglect
and
indifference
continue
we
will
not
govern
them
effectively
ourselves
our
policy
so
far
as
we
have
any
policy
is
to
extend
among
them
the
principles
of
and
can
only
precipitate
our
extinction
there
as
completely
as
we
know
that
it
would
do
in
india
if
we
were
wild
enough
to
venture
the
plunge
there
is
no
enchantment
in
which
will
make
people
love
each
other
when
they
are
indifferent
or
estranged
it
can
only
force
them
into
sharper
collision
the
opinion
in
cuba
was
and
is
that
america
is
the
residuary
legatee
of
all
the
islands
spanish
and
english
equally
and
that
she
will
be
forced
to
take
charge
of
them
in
the
end
whether
she
likes
it
or
not
spain
governs
unjustly
and
corruptly
the
cubans
will
not
rest
till
they
are
free
from
her
and
if
once
independent
they
will
throw
themselves
on
american
protection
we
will
not
govern
our
islands
at
all
but
leave
them
to
drift
jamaica
and
the
antilles
given
over
to
the
negro
majorities
can
only
become
like
hayti
and
domingo
and
the
nature
of
things
will
hardly
permit
so
fair
a
part
of
the
earth
which
has
been
once
civilised
and
under
white
control
to
fall
back
into
barbarism
to
england
the
loss
of
the
west
indies
would
not
itself
be
serious
but
in
the
life
of
nations
discreditable
failures
are
not
measured
by
their
immediate
material
consequences
to
allow
a
group
of
colonies
to
slide
out
of
our
hands
because
we
could
not
or
would
not
provide
them
with
a
tolerable
government
would
be
nothing
less
than
a
public
disgrace
it
would
be
an
intimation
to
all
the
world
that
we
were
unable
to
maintain
any
longer
the
position
which
our
fathers
had
made
for
us
and
when
the
unravelling
of
the
knitted
fabric
of
the
empire
has
once
begun
the
process
will
be
a
rapid
one
what
would
you
do
i
am
asked
impatiently
send
out
peers
or
gentlemen
against
whose
character
no
direct
objection
can
be
raised
we
assist
them
with
local
councils
partly
chosen
by
the
people
themselves
we
send
out
bishops
we
send
out
missionaries
we
open
schools
what
can
we
do
more
we
can
not
alter
the
climate
we
can
not
make
planters
prosper
when
sugar
will
not
pay
we
can
not
convert
black
men
into
whites
we
can
not
force
the
blacks
to
work
for
the
whites
when
they
do
not
wish
to
work
for
them
governing
as
you
call
it
will
not
change
the
natural
conditions
of
things
you
can
suggest
no
remedy
and
mere
is
foolish
and
mischievous
i
might
answer
a
good
many
things
government
can
not
do
everything
but
it
can
do
something
and
there
is
a
difference
between
governors
against
whom
there
is
nothing
to
object
and
men
of
special
and
marked
capacity
there
is
a
difference
between
governors
whose
hands
are
tied
by
local
councils
and
whose
feet
are
tied
by
instructions
from
home
and
a
governor
with
a
free
hand
and
a
wise
head
left
to
take
his
own
measures
on
the
spot
i
presume
that
no
one
can
seriously
expect
that
an
orderly
organised
nation
can
be
made
out
of
the
blacks
when
in
spite
of
your
schools
and
missionaries
sixty
per
cent
of
the
children
now
born
among
them
are
illegitimate
you
can
do
for
the
west
indies
i
repeat
over
and
over
again
what
you
do
for
the
east
you
can
establish
a
firm
authoritative
government
which
will
protect
the
blacks
in
their
civil
rights
and
protect
the
whites
in
theirs
you
can
not
alter
the
climate
it
is
true
or
make
the
soil
more
fertile
already
it
is
fertile
as
any
in
the
earth
and
the
climate
is
admirable
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
is
needed
but
you
can
restore
confidence
in
the
stability
of
your
tenure
you
can
give
courage
to
the
whites
who
are
on
the
spot
to
remain
there
and
you
can
tempt
capital
and
enterprise
to
venture
there
which
now
seek
investments
elsewhere
by
keeping
the
rule
in
your
own
hands
you
will
restore
the
white
population
to
their
legitimate
influence
the
blacks
will
again
look
up
to
them
and
respect
them
as
they
ought
to
do
this
you
can
do
and
it
will
cost
you
nothing
save
a
little
more
pains
in
the
selection
of
the
persons
whom
you
are
to
trust
with
powers
analogous
to
those
which
you
grant
to
your
provincial
governors
in
the
indian
peninsula
a
preliminary
condition
of
this
as
of
all
other
real
improvements
is
one
however
which
will
hardly
be
fulfilled
before
a
beginning
can
be
made
a
conviction
is
wanted
that
life
has
other
objects
besides
present
interest
and
convenience
and
very
few
of
us
indeed
have
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
any
such
conviction
at
all
we
can
talk
about
it
in
fine
language
no
age
ever
talked
more
or
better
but
we
do
believe
in
it
we
believe
only
in
professing
to
believe
which
soothes
our
vanity
and
does
not
interfere
with
our
actions
from
fine
words
no
harvests
grow
the
negroes
are
well
disposed
to
follow
and
obey
any
white
who
will
be
kind
and
just
to
them
and
in
such
following
and
obedience
their
only
hope
of
improvement
lies
the
problem
is
to
create
a
state
of
things
under
which
englishmen
of
vigour
and
character
will
make
their
homes
among
them
annexation
to
the
united
states
would
lead
probably
to
their
extermination
at
no
very
distant
time
the
antilles
are
small
and
the
fate
of
the
negroes
there
might
be
no
better
than
the
fate
of
the
caribs
the
americans
are
not
a
people
who
can
be
trifled
with
no
one
knows
it
better
than
the
negroes
they
fear
them
they
prefer
infinitely
the
mild
rule
of
england
and
under
such
a
government
as
we
might
provide
if
we
cared
to
try
the
whole
of
our
islands
might
become
like
the
moravian
settlement
in
jamaica
and
the
black
nature
which
has
rather
degenerated
than
improved
in
these
late
days
of
licence
might
be
put
again
in
the
way
of
regeneration
the
process
would
be
slow
your
seedlings
in
a
plantation
hang
stationary
year
after
year
but
they
do
move
at
last
we
can
not
disown
our
responsibility
for
these
poor
adopted
brothers
of
ours
we
send
missionaries
into
africa
to
convert
them
to
a
better
form
of
religion
why
should
the
attempt
seem
chimerical
to
convert
them
practically
to
a
higher
purpose
in
our
own
colonies
the
reader
will
be
weary
of
a
sermon
the
points
of
which
have
been
reiterated
so
often
i
might
say
that
he
requires
to
have
the
lesson
impressed
upon
him
that
it
is
for
his
good
that
i
insist
upon
it
and
not
for
my
own
but
this
is
the
common
language
of
all
preachers
and
it
is
not
found
to
make
the
hearers
more
attentive
i
will
not
promise
to
say
no
more
upon
the
subject
for
it
was
forced
upon
me
at
every
moment
and
point
of
my
journey
i
am
arriving
near
the
end
however
and
if
he
has
followed
so
far
he
will
perhaps
go
on
with
me
to
the
conclusion
i
had
three
weeks
to
give
to
havana
they
were
fast
running
out
and
it
was
time
for
me
to
be
going
strange
stories
too
came
from
england
which
made
me
uneasy
till
i
knew
how
they
were
set
in
circulation
one
day
gladstone
was
said
to
have
gone
mad
and
the
queen
the
next
the
russians
were
about
to
annex
afghanistan
our
troops
had
been
cut
to
pieces
in
burmah
something
was
going
wrong
with
us
every
day
in
one
corner
of
the
world
or
another
i
found
at
last
that
the
telegraphic
intelligence
was
supplied
to
the
cuban
newspapers
from
new
york
that
the
telegraph
clerks
there
were
generally
irish
and
their
facts
were
the
creation
of
their
wishes
i
was
to
return
to
jamaica
in
the
same
vessel
which
had
brought
me
from
it
she
had
been
down
to
the
isthmus
and
was
to
call
at
havana
on
her
way
back
the
captain
most
english
face
was
a
welcome
sight
to
me
when
he
appeared
one
evening
at
dinner
he
had
come
to
tell
me
that
he
was
to
sail
early
on
the
following
morning
and
i
arranged
to
go
on
board
with
him
the
same
night
the
had
not
forgotten
to
instruct
the
gobierno
civil
to
grant
me
an
i
do
not
know
that
i
gained
much
by
his
intercession
for
without
it
i
should
hardly
have
been
detained
indefinitely
and
as
it
was
i
had
to
pay
more
dollars
than
i
liked
to
part
with
the
necessary
documents
however
had
been
sent
through
the
british
consul
and
i
was
free
to
leave
when
i
pleased
i
paid
my
bill
at
the
hotel
which
was
not
after
all
an
extravagant
one
cleared
my
of
the
remainder
of
the
soiled
and
tattered
paper
which
is
called
money
and
does
duty
for
it
down
to
a
and
with
my
distinguished
friend
don
g
the
real
acquisition
which
i
had
made
in
coming
to
his
country
and
who
would
not
leave
me
till
i
was
in
the
boat
i
drove
away
to
the
wharf
it
was
a
still
lovely
starlight
night
the
moon
had
risen
over
the
hills
and
was
shining
brightly
on
the
roofs
and
towers
of
the
city
and
on
the
masts
and
spars
of
the
vessels
which
were
riding
in
the
harbour
there
was
not
a
ripple
on
the
water
and
stars
and
city
towers
and
ships
stood
inverted
on
the
surface
pointing
downward
as
into
a
second
infinity
the
charm
was
unfortunately
interfered
with
by
odours
worse
than
coleridge
found
at
cologne
and
cursed
in
rhyme
the
drains
of
havana
like
orange
blossom
give
off
their
most
fragrant
vapours
in
the
dark
hours
i
could
well
believe
don
g
saying
that
but
for
the
natural
healthiness
of
the
place
they
would
all
die
of
it
like
poisoned
flies
we
had
to
cut
our
adieus
short
for
the
mouth
of
some
horrid
sewer
was
close
to
us
in
the
boat
i
did
not
escape
the
water
smelt
horribly
as
it
was
stirred
by
the
oars
charged
as
it
was
with
three
centuries
of
pollution
and
the
phosphorescent
light
shone
with
a
sickly
brilliance
one
could
have
fancied
that
one
was
in
charon
boat
and
was
crossing
acheron
when
i
reached
the
steamer
i
watched
from
the
deck
the
same
phenomenon
which
is
described
by
tom
cringle
a
fathom
deep
in
the
ship
shadow
some
shark
or
other
monster
sailed
slowly
by
in
an
envelope
of
spectral
lustre
when
he
stopped
his
figure
disappeared
when
he
moved
on
again
it
was
like
the
movement
of
a
streak
of
blue
flame
such
a
creature
did
not
seem
as
if
it
could
belong
to
our
familiar
sunlit
ocean
the
state
of
the
harbour
is
not
creditable
to
the
spanish
government
and
i
suppose
will
not
be
improved
till
there
is
some
change
of
dynasty
all
that
can
be
said
for
it
is
that
it
is
not
the
worst
in
these
seas
our
ship
had
just
come
from
the
canal
and
had
brought
the
latest
news
from
thence
but
the
miscalculations
of
the
work
to
be
done
and
of
the
expense
of
doing
it
are
now
notorious
to
all
the
world
the
alternatives
are
to
abandon
an
enterprise
so
splendid
in
conception
so
disastrous
in
the
execution
or
to
raise
and
spend
fresh
tens
of
millions
to
follow
those
that
are
gone
with
no
certain
prospect
of
success
after
all
the
saddest
part
of
the
story
will
be
soonest
forgotten
the
frightful
consumption
of
human
life
in
those
damp
and
pestilential
jungles
lesseps
having
made
his
name
immortal
at
suez
aspired
at
eclipsing
his
first
achievement
by
a
second
yet
more
splendidly
ambitious
at
a
time
of
life
when
common
men
are
content
to
retire
upon
their
laurels
he
deserves
and
will
receive
an
unstinted
admiration
for
his
energy
and
his
enthusiasm
but
his
countrymen
who
have
so
zealously
supported
him
will
be
rewarded
with
no
dividend
upon
their
shares
even
if
the
two
oceans
are
eventually
united
and
no
final
success
can
be
looked
for
in
the
bold
projector
life
time
at
dawn
we
swept
out
under
the
moro
and
away
once
more
into
the
free
fresh
open
sea
we
had
come
down
on
the
south
side
of
the
island
we
returned
by
the
north
up
the
old
bahama
channel
where
drake
died
on
his
way
home
from
his
last
unsuccessful
expedition
lope
de
vega
singing
a
pæan
over
the
end
of
the
great
fresh
passengers
brought
fresh
talk
there
was
a
clever
young
jamaican
on
board
returning
from
a
holiday
he
had
the
spirits
of
youth
about
him
and
would
have
pleased
my
american
who
never
knew
good
come
of
despondency
he
had
hopes
for
his
country
but
they
rested
like
those
of
every
sensible
man
that
i
met
on
an
inability
to
believe
that
there
would
be
further
advances
in
the
direction
of
political
liberty
a
revised
constitution
he
said
could
issue
only
in
fresh
gordon
riots
and
fresh
calamities
he
had
been
travelling
in
the
southern
states
he
had
seen
the
state
of
mississippi
deserted
by
the
whites
and
falling
back
into
a
black
wilderness
he
had
seen
south
carolina
which
had
narrowly
escaped
ruin
under
a
black
and
legislature
and
had
recovered
itself
under
the
steady
determination
of
the
americans
that
the
civil
war
was
not
to
mean
the
domination
of
negro
over
white
the
danger
was
greater
in
the
english
islands
than
in
either
of
these
states
from
the
enormous
disproportion
of
numbers
the
experiment
could
be
ventured
only
under
a
high
census
and
a
restricted
franchise
but
the
experience
of
all
countries
showed
that
these
limited
franchises
were
invidious
and
could
not
be
maintained
the
end
was
involved
in
the
beginning
and
he
trusted
that
prudent
counsels
would
prevail
we
had
gone
too
far
already
on
board
also
there
was
a
traveller
from
a
manchester
house
of
business
who
gave
me
a
more
flourishing
account
than
i
expected
of
the
state
of
our
trade
not
so
much
with
the
english
islands
as
with
the
spaniards
in
cuba
and
on
the
mainland
his
own
house
he
said
had
a
large
business
with
havana
twenty
firms
in
the
north
of
england
were
competing
there
and
all
were
doing
well
the
spanish
americans
on
the
west
side
of
the
continent
were
good
customers
with
the
exception
of
the
mexicans
who
were
energetic
and
industrious
and
manufactured
for
their
own
consumption
these
modern
aztecs
were
skilful
workmen
and
inventive
wages
were
low
but
they
were
contented
with
them
mexico
i
was
surprised
to
hear
from
him
was
rising
fast
into
prosperity
whether
human
life
was
any
safer
then
than
it
was
a
few
years
ago
he
did
not
tell
me
amidst
talk
and
chess
and
occasional
whist
after
nightfall
when
reading
became
difficult
we
ran
along
with
smooth
seas
land
sometimes
in
sight
with
shoals
on
either
side
of
us
we
were
to
have
one
more
glimpse
of
hayti
we
were
to
touch
at
port
au
prince
the
seat
of
government
of
the
successors
of
toussaint
if
beauty
of
situation
could
mould
human
character
the
inhabitants
of
port
au
prince
might
claim
to
be
the
first
of
mankind
domingo
or
española
of
which
hayti
is
the
largest
division
was
the
earliest
island
discovered
by
columbus
and
the
finest
in
the
caribbean
ocean
it
remained
spanish
as
i
have
already
said
for
years
when
hayti
was
taken
by
the
french
buccaneers
and
made
over
by
them
to
louis
xiv
the
french
kept
it
till
the
revolution
they
built
towns
they
laid
out
farms
and
sugar
fields
they
planted
coffee
all
over
the
island
where
it
now
grows
wild
vast
herds
of
cattle
roamed
over
the
mountains
splendid
houses
rose
over
the
rich
savannahs
the
french
church
put
out
its
strength
there
were
churches
and
priests
in
every
parish
there
were
monasteries
and
nunneries
for
the
religious
orders
so
firm
was
the
hold
that
they
had
gained
that
hayti
like
cuba
seemed
to
have
been
made
a
part
of
the
old
world
and
as
civilised
as
france
itself
but
french
civilisation
became
itself
electric
the
revolution
came
and
the
reign
of
liberty
the
blacks
took
arms
they
surprised
the
plantations
they
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
whole
french
population
yellow
fever
swept
away
the
armies
which
were
sent
to
avenge
the
massacre
and
france
being
engaged
in
annexing
europe
had
no
leisure
to
despatch
more
the
island
being
thus
derelict
spain
and
england
both
tried
their
hand
to
recover
it
but
failed
from
the
same
cause
and
a
black
nation
with
a
republican
constitution
and
a
population
perhaps
of
about
a
million
and
a
half
of
negroes
has
since
been
in
unchallenged
possession
and
has
arrived
at
the
condition
which
has
been
described
to
us
by
sir
spenser
john
republics
which
begin
with
murder
and
plunder
do
not
come
to
much
good
in
this
world
hayti
has
passed
through
many
revolutions
and
is
no
nearer
than
at
first
to
stability
the
present
president
salomon
who
was
long
a
refugee
in
jamaica
came
into
power
a
few
years
back
by
a
turn
of
the
wheel
he
was
described
to
me
as
a
peremptory
gentleman
who
made
quick
work
with
his
political
opponents
his
term
of
office
having
nearly
expired
he
had
himself
shortly
before
for
another
seven
years
and
was
prepared
to
maintain
his
right
by
any
measures
which
he
might
think
expedient
he
had
a
few
regiments
of
soldiers
who
i
was
told
were
devoted
to
him
and
a
fleet
consisting
of
two
gunboats
commanded
by
an
american
officer
to
whom
he
chiefly
owed
his
security
we
had
steamed
along
the
hayti
coast
all
one
afternoon
underneath
a
high
range
of
hills
which
used
to
be
the
hunting
ground
of
the
buccaneers
we
had
passed
their
famous
tortugas
without
seeing
them
towards
evening
we
entered
the
long
channel
between
gonaive
island
and
the
mainland
going
slowly
that
we
might
not
arrive
at
port
au
prince
before
daylight
it
was
six
in
the
morning
when
the
anchor
rattled
down
and
i
went
on
deck
to
look
about
me
we
were
at
the
head
of
a
fiord
rather
broader
than
those
in
norway
but
very
like
them
wooded
mountains
rising
on
either
side
of
us
an
open
valley
in
front
and
on
the
rich
level
soil
washed
down
by
the
rains
and
deposited
along
the
shore
the
old
french
and
now
president
salomon
capital
palms
and
oranges
and
other
trees
were
growing
everywhere
among
the
houses
giving
the
impression
of
graceful
civilisation
directly
before
us
were
three
or
four
wooded
islets
which
form
a
natural
breakwater
and
above
them
were
seen
the
masts
of
the
vessels
which
were
lying
in
the
harbour
behind
close
to
where
we
were
brought
up
lay
the
an
english
frigate
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
her
an
american
frigate
of
about
the
same
size
with
the
stars
and
stripes
conspicuously
flying
we
have
had
some
differences
of
late
with
the
hayti
authorities
and
the
satisfaction
which
we
asked
for
having
been
refused
or
delayed
a
had
been
sent
to
ask
redress
in
more
peremptory
terms
the
town
lay
under
her
guns
the
president
ships
which
she
might
perhaps
have
seized
as
a
security
had
been
taken
out
of
sight
into
shallow
water
where
she
could
not
follow
them
the
americans
have
no
particular
rights
in
hayti
and
are
as
little
liked
as
we
are
but
they
are
feared
and
they
do
not
allow
any
business
of
a
serious
kind
to
go
on
in
those
waters
without
knowing
what
it
is
about
perhaps
the
president
admiral
of
the
station
being
an
american
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
their
presence
anyway
there
the
two
ships
were
lying
when
i
came
up
from
below
their
hulks
and
spars
outlined
picturesquely
against
the
steep
wooded
shores
the
air
was
hot
and
steamy
fishing
vessels
with
white
sails
were
drifting
slowly
about
the
glassy
water
except
for
the
heat
and
a
black
officer
of
the
customs
in
uniform
and
his
boat
and
black
crew
alongside
i
could
have
believed
myself
off
mölde
or
some
similar
norwegian
town
so
like
everything
seemed
even
to
the
colour
of
the
houses
we
were
to
stay
some
hours
after
breakfast
we
landed
i
had
seen
jacmel
and
therefore
thought
myself
prepared
for
the
worst
which
i
should
find
jacmel
was
an
outlying
symptom
port
au
prince
was
the
central
ulcer
long
before
we
came
to
shore
there
came
off
whiffs
not
of
drains
as
at
havana
but
of
active
dirt
fermenting
in
the
sunlight
calling
our
handkerchiefs
to
our
help
and
looking
to
our
feet
carefully
we
stepped
up
upon
the
quay
and
walked
forward
as
judiciously
as
we
could
with
the
help
of
stones
we
crossed
a
shallow
ditch
where
rotten
fish
vegetables
and
other
articles
were
lying
about
promiscuously
and
we
came
on
what
did
duty
for
a
grand
parade
we
were
in
a
paris
of
the
gutter
with
boulevards
and
and
crimson
parasols
the
boulevards
were
littered
with
the
refuse
of
the
houses
and
were
foul
as
pigsties
and
the
ladies
under
the
parasols
were
picking
their
way
along
them
in
parisian
boots
and
silk
dresses
i
saw
a
broken
down
in
a
black
pool
out
of
which
a
blacker
ladyship
was
scrambling
fever
breeds
so
prodigally
in
that
pestilential
squalor
that
people
were
estimated
to
have
died
of
it
in
a
single
year
there
were
shops
and
stores
and
streets
men
and
women
in
tawdry
european
costume
and
officers
on
horseback
with
a
tatter
of
lace
and
gilding
we
passed
up
the
principal
avenue
which
opened
on
the
market
place
above
the
market
was
the
cathedral
more
hideous
than
even
the
mormon
temple
at
salt
lake
it
was
full
of
ladies
the
rank
beauty
and
fashion
of
port
au
prince
were
at
their
morning
mass
for
they
are
catholics
with
african
beliefs
underneath
they
have
a
french
clergy
an
archbishop
and
bishop
paid
miserably
but
still
subsisting
subsisting
not
as
objects
of
reverence
at
all
as
they
are
at
dominica
but
as
the
humble
servants
and
ministers
of
black
society
we
english
are
in
bad
favour
just
now
no
wonder
with
the
guns
of
the
pointed
at
the
city
but
the
chief
complaint
is
on
account
of
sir
spenser
book
which
they
cry
out
against
with
a
degree
of
anger
which
is
the
surest
evidence
of
its
truth
it
would
be
unfair
even
to
hint
at
the
names
or
stations
of
various
persons
who
gave
me
information
about
the
condition
of
the
place
and
people
enough
that
those
who
knew
well
what
they
were
speaking
about
assured
me
that
hayti
was
the
most
ridiculous
caricature
of
civilisation
in
the
whole
world
doubtless
the
whites
there
are
not
disinterested
witnesses
for
they
are
treated
as
they
once
treated
the
blacks
they
can
own
no
freehold
property
and
exist
only
on
tolerance
they
are
called
trash
black
dukes
and
marquises
drive
over
them
in
the
street
and
swear
at
them
and
they
consider
it
an
invasion
of
the
natural
order
of
things
if
this
was
the
worst
or
even
if
the
dirt
and
the
disease
was
the
worst
it
might
be
borne
with
for
the
whites
might
go
away
if
they
pleased
and
they
pay
the
penalty
themselves
for
choosing
to
be
there
but
this
is
not
the
worst
immorality
is
so
universal
that
it
almost
ceases
to
be
a
fault
for
a
fault
implies
an
exception
and
in
hayti
it
is
the
rule
young
people
make
experiment
of
one
another
before
they
will
enter
into
any
closer
connection
so
far
they
are
no
worse
than
in
our
own
english
islands
where
the
custom
is
equally
general
but
behind
the
immorality
behind
the
religiosity
there
lies
active
and
alive
the
horrible
revival
of
the
west
african
superstitions
the
serpent
worship
and
the
child
sacrifice
and
the
cannibalism
there
is
no
room
to
doubt
it
a
missionary
assured
me
that
an
instance
of
it
occurred
only
a
year
ago
within
his
own
personal
knowledge
the
facts
are
notorious
a
full
account
was
published
in
one
of
the
local
newspapers
and
the
only
result
was
that
the
president
imprisoned
the
editor
for
exposing
his
country
a
few
years
ago
persons
guilty
of
these
infamies
were
tried
and
punished
now
they
are
left
alone
because
to
prosecute
and
convict
them
would
be
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
indictment
in
this
as
in
all
other
communities
there
is
a
better
side
as
well
as
a
worse
the
better
part
is
ashamed
of
the
condition
into
which
the
country
has
fallen
rational
and
haytians
would
welcome
back
the
french
but
for
an
impression
whether
well
founded
or
ill
i
know
not
that
the
americans
would
not
suffer
any
european
nation
to
reacquire
or
recover
any
new
territory
on
their
side
of
the
atlantic
they
make
the
most
they
can
of
their
french
connection
they
send
their
children
to
paris
to
be
educated
and
many
of
them
go
thither
themselves
there
is
money
among
them
though
industry
there
is
none
the
hayti
coffee
which
bears
so
high
a
reputation
is
simply
gathered
under
the
bushes
which
the
french
planters
left
behind
them
and
is
half
as
excellent
as
it
ought
to
be
because
it
is
so
carelessly
cleaned
yet
so
rich
is
the
island
in
these
and
other
natural
productions
that
they
can
not
entirely
ruin
it
they
have
a
revenue
from
their
customs
of
dollars
to
be
the
prey
of
political
schemers
they
have
a
constitution
of
course
with
a
legislature
two
houses
of
a
legislature
universal
suffrage
but
it
does
not
save
them
from
revolutions
which
recurred
every
two
or
three
years
till
the
time
of
the
present
president
he
being
of
stronger
metal
than
the
rest
takes
care
that
the
votes
are
given
as
he
pleases
shoots
down
recusants
and
knows
how
to
make
himself
feared
he
is
a
giant
they
say
i
did
not
see
him
six

height
and
broad
in
proportion
when
in
jamaica
he
was
a
friend
of
gordon
and
the
intimacy
between
them
is
worth
noting
as
throwing
light
on
gordon
political
aspirations
i
stayed
no
longer
than
the
ship
business
detained
the
captain
and
i
breathed
more
freely
when
i
had
left
that
miserable
of
ferocity
and
philanthropic
sentiment
no
one
can
foretell
the
future
fate
of
the
black
republic
but
the
present
order
of
things
can
not
last
in
an
island
so
close
under
the
american
shores
if
the
americans
forbid
any
other
power
to
interfere
they
will
have
to
interfere
themselves
if
they
find
mormonism
an
intolerable
blot
upon
their
escutcheon
they
will
have
to
put
a
stop
in
some
way
or
other
to
cannibalism
and
meanwhile
the
ninety
years
of
negro
have
had
their
use
in
showing
what
it
really
means
and
if
english
statesmen
either
to
save
themselves
trouble
or
to
please
the
prevailing
uninstructed
sentiment
insist
on
extending
it
they
will
be
found
when
the
accounts
are
made
up
to
have
been
no
better
friends
to
the
unlucky
negro
than
their
forefathers
from
the
head
of
the
bay
on
which
port
au
prince
stands
there
reaches
out
on
the
west
the
long
arm
or
peninsula
which
is
so
peculiar
a
feature
in
the
geography
of
the
island
the
arm
bone
is
a
continuous
ridge
of
mountains
rising
to
a
height
of
feet
and
stretching
for
miles
at
the
back
towards
the
ocean
is
jacmel
on
the
other
side
is
the
bight
of
leogane
over
which
and
along
the
land
our
course
lay
after
leaving
president
salomon
city
the
day
was
unusually
hot
and
we
sat
under
an
awning
on
deck
watching
the
changes
in
the
landscape
as
ravines
opened
and
closed
again
and
tall
peaks
changed
their
shapes
and
angles
clouds
came
down
upon
the
mountain
tops
and
passed
off
again
whole
galleries
of
pictures
swept
by
and
nature
never
made
more
lovely
ones
the
peculiarity
of
tropical
mountain
scenery
is
that
the
high
summits
are
clothed
with
trees
the
outlines
are
thus
softened
and
rounded
save
where
the
rock
is
broken
into
precipices
along
the
sea
and
for
several
miles
inland
are
the
basses
terres
as
they
used
to
be
called
level
alluvial
plains
cut
and
watered
at
intervals
by
rivers
once
covered
with
thriving
plantations
and
now
a
jungle
there
are
no
wild
beasts
there
save
an
occasional
man
few
snakes
and
those
not
dangerous
the
acres
of
richest
soil
which
are
waiting
there
till
reasonable
beings
can
return
and
cultivate
them
must
be
hundreds
of
thousands
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
slopes
there
are
all
gradations
of
climate
abundant
water
grass
lands
that
might
be
black
with
cattle
or
on
the
loftier
ranges
white
with
sheep
it
is
strange
to
think
how
chequered
a
history
these
islands
have
had
how
far
they
are
even
yet
from
any
condition
which
promises
permanence
not
one
of
them
has
arrived
at
any
stable
independence
spaniards
english
and
french
dutch
and
danes
scrambled
for
them
fought
for
them
occupied
them
more
or
less
with
their
own
people
but
it
was
not
to
found
new
nations
but
to
get
gold
or
get
something
which
could
be
changed
for
gold
only
occasionally
and
as
it
were
by
accident
they
became
the
theatre
of
any
grander
game
the
war
of
the
reformation
was
carried
thither
and
heroic
deeds
were
done
there
but
it
was
by
adventurers
who
were
in
search
of
plunder
for
themselves
france
and
england
fought
among
the
antilles
and
their
names
are
connected
with
many
a
gallant
action
but
they
fought
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
seas
not
for
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
french
or
english
inhabitants
of
the
islands
instead
of
occupying
them
with
free
inhabitants
the
european
nations
filled
them
with
slave
gangs
they
were
valued
only
for
the
wealth
which
they
yielded
and
society
there
has
never
assumed
any
particularly
noble
aspect
there
has
been
splendour
and
luxurious
living
and
there
have
been
crimes
and
horrors
and
revolts
and
massacres
there
has
been
romance
but
it
has
been
the
romance
of
pirates
and
outlaws
the
natural
graces
of
human
life
do
not
show
themselves
under
such
conditions
there
has
been
no
saint
in
the
west
indies
since
las
casas
no
hero
unless
philonegro
enthusiasm
can
make
one
out
of
toussaint
there
are
no
people
there
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
with
a
character
and
purpose
of
their
own
unless
to
some
extent
in
cuba
and
therefore
when
the
wind
has
changed
and
the
wealth
for
which
the
islands
were
alone
desired
is
no
longer
to
be
made
among
them
and
slavery
is
no
longer
possible
and
would
not
pay
if
it
were
there
is
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
the
palaces
of
the
english
planters
and
merchants
fall
to
decay
their
wines
and
their
furniture
their
books
and
their
pictures
are
sold
or
dispersed
their
existence
is
a
struggle
to
keep
afloat
and
one
by
one
they
go
under
in
the
waves
the
blacks
as
long
as
they
were
slaves
were
docile
and
partially
civilised
they
have
behaved
on
the
whole
well
in
our
islands
since
their
emancipation
for
though
they
were
personally
free
the
whites
were
still
their
rulers
and
they
looked
up
to
them
with
respect
they
have
acquired
land
and
notions
of
property
some
of
them
can
read
many
of
them
are
tolerable
workmen
and
some
excellent
but
in
character
the
movement
is
backwards
not
forwards
even
in
hayti
after
the
first
outburst
of
ferocity
a
tolerable
government
was
possible
for
a
generation
or
two
orderly
habits
are
not
immediately
lost
but
the
effect
of
leaving
the
negro
nature
to
itself
is
apparent
at
last
in
the
english
islands
they
are
innocently
happy
in
the
unconsciousness
of
the
obligations
of
morality
they
eat
drink
sleep
and
smoke
and
do
the
least
in
the
way
of
work
that
they
can
they
have
no
ideas
of
duty
and
therefore
are
not
made
uneasy
by
neglecting
it
one
or
other
of
them
occasionally
rises
in
the
legal
or
other
profession
but
there
is
no
sign
not
the
slightest
that
the
generality
of
the
race
are
improving
either
in
intelligence
or
moral
habits
all
the
evidence
is
the
other
way
no
uncle
tom
no
aunt
chloe
need
be
looked
for
in
a
negro
cabin
in
the
west
indies
if
such
specimens
of
black
humanity
are
to
be
found
anywhere
it
will
be
where
they
have
continued
under
the
old
influences
as
servants
in
white
men
houses
the
generality
are
mere
animals
who
in
service
had
learnt
certain
accomplishments
and
had
developed
certain
qualities
of
a
higher
kind
left
to
themselves
they
fall
back
upon
the
superstitions
and
habits
of
their
ancestors
the
key
to
the
character
of
any
people
is
to
be
found
in
the
local
customs
which
have
spontaneously
grown
or
are
growing
among
them
the
customs
of
dahomey
have
not
yet
shown
themselves
in
the
english
west
indies
and
never
can
while
the
english
authority
is
maintained
but
no
custom
of
any
kind
will
be
found
in
a
negro
hut
or
village
from
which
his
most
sanguine
friend
can
derive
a
hope
that
he
is
on
the
way
to
mending
himself
roses
do
not
grow
on
thorn
trees
nor
figs
on

a
healthy
human
civilisation
was
not
perhaps
to
be
looked
for
in
countries
which
have
been
alternately
the
prey
of
avarice
ambition
and
sentimentalism
we
visit
foreign
countries
to
see
varieties
of
life
and
character
to
learn
languages
that
we
may
gain
an
insight
into
various
literatures
to
see
manners
unlike
our
own
springing
naturally
out
of
different
soils
and
climates
to
see
beautiful
works
of
art
to
see
places
associated
with
great
men
and
great
actions
and
subsidiary
to
these
to
see
lakes
and
mountains
and
strange
skies
and
seas
but
the
localities
of
great
events
and
the
homes
of
the
actors
in
them
are
only
saddening
when
the
spiritual
results
are
disappointing
and
scenery
loses
its
charm
unless
the
grace
of
humanity
is
in
the
heart
of
it
to
the
man
of
science
the
west
indies
may
be
delightful
and
instructive
rocks
and
trees
and
flowers
remain
as
they
always
were
and
nature
is
constant
to
herself
but
the
traveller
whose
heart
is
with
his
kind
and
who
cares
only
to
see
his
brother
mortals
making
their
corner
of
this
planet
into
an
orderly
and
rational
home
had
better
choose
some
other
object
for
his
pilgrimage

is
an

in

seemed
so
and

that
they
mixed
pleasantly
in

dreams
one
morning
after
they
had
been
holding
a
special
jubilee
the
butler
apologised
for
them
when
he
came
to
call
me
and
laughed
as
at
the
best
of
jokes
when
i
said
they
did
not

great
feature
of
the
day
was
five

ranged
themselves
on

round
their

ate

with

why
should
a

like
this
pass
away
why
may
it
not
extend
itself
till
it
has
transformed
the

of
all
our

happy
in

spreading
round

not
indeed
only
because
we
are
enchanted
because
in

two
hundred

condemn

this

be

the
scattered

the
idlest

most
that
is

be

to
arrest
any
active

have
a

to
control

vagaries

check

passions

majorities
what
the

is
to
them
the
crown
ought
to
be
for

but
the

is

remain

therefore
we
are
as
we
are
and
our
national
existence
is
made
the
shuttlecock
of
party
contention
time
passed
so
pleasantly
with
me
in
these
concluding
days
that
i
could
have
wished
it
to
be
the
nothing
which
metaphysicians
say
that
it
is
and
that
when
one
was
happy
it
would
leave
one
alone
we
wandered
in
the
shade
in
the
mornings
we
made
expeditions
in
the
evenings
called
at
friends
houses
and
listened
to
the
gossip
of
the
island
it
turned
usually
on
the
one
absorbing
subject
black
servants
and
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
them
an
american
lady
from
pennsylvania
declared
emphatically
as
her
opinion
that
emancipation
had
been
a
piece
of
folly
and
that
things
would
never
mend
till
they
were
slaves
again
one
of
my
own
chief
hopes
in
going
originally
to
jamaica
had
been
to
see
and
learn
the
views
of
the
distinguished
governor
there
sir
henry
norman
had
been
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
the
soldier
civilians
in
india
he
had
brought
with
him
a
brilliant
reputation
he
had
won
the
confidence
in
the
west
indies
of
all
classes
and
all
colours
he
if
anyone
would
understand
the
problem
and
from
the
high
vantage
ground
of
experience
would
know
what
could
or
could
not
be
done
to
restore
the
influence
of
england
and
the
prosperity
of
the
colonies
unfortunately
sir
henry
had
been
called
to
london
as
i
mentioned
before
on
a
question
of
the
conduct
of
some
official
and
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
miss
him
altogether
he
returned
however
the
day
before
i
was
to
sail
he
was
kind
enough
to
ask
me
to
spend
an
evening
with
him
and
i
was
again
on
my
last
night
a
guest
at
king
house
a
dinner
party
offers
small
opportunity
for
serious
conversation
nor
indeed
could
i
expect
a
great
person
in
sir
henry
position
to
enter
upon
subjects
of
consequence
with
a
stranger
like
myself
i
could
see
however
that
i
had
nothing
to
correct
in
the
impression
of
his
character
which
his
reputation
had
led
me
to
form
about
him
and
i
wished
more
than
ever
that
the
system
of
government
of
which
he
had
been
so
admirable
a
servant
in
india
could
be
applied
to
his
present
position
and
that
he
or
such
as
he
could
have
the
administration
of
it
we
had
common
friends
in
the
indian
service
to
talk
about
one
especially
reynell
taylor
now
dead
who
had
been
the
earliest
of
my
boy
companions
taylor
had
been
one
of
the
handful
of
english
who
held
the
punjaub
in
the
first
revolt
of
the
sikhs
with
a
woman
modesty
he
had
the
spirit
of
a
sir
henry
described
him
as
the
soul
of
chivalry
and
seemed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
the
same
pure
and
noble
nature
perhaps
liable
from
the
generosity
of
his
temperament
to
believe
more
than
i
could
do
in
modern
notions
and
in
modern
political
heroes
but
certainly
not
inclining
of
his
own
will
to
recommend
any
rash
innovations
i
perceived
that
like
myself
he
felt
no
regret
that
so
much
of
the
soil
of
jamaica
was
passing
to
peasant
black
proprietors
he
thought
well
of
their
natural
disposition
he
believed
them
capable
of
improvement
he
thought
that
the
possession
of
land
of
their
own
would
bring
them
into
voluntary
industry
and
lead
them
gradually
to
the
adoption
of
civilised
habits
he
spoke
with
reserve
and
perhaps
i
may
not
have
understood
him
fully
but
he
did
not
seem
to
me
to
think
much
of
their
political
capacity
the
local
boards
which
have
been
established
as
an
education
for
higher
functions
have
not
been
a
success
they
had
been
described
to
me
in
all
parts
of
the
island
as
inflammable
centres
of
peculation
and
mismanagement
sir
henry
said
nothing
from
which
i
could
gather
his
own
opinion
i
inferred
however
he
will
pardon
me
if
i
misrepresent
him
that
he
had
no
great
belief
in
a
federation
of
the
islands
in
government
and
such
like
as
within
the
bounds
of
present
possibilities
nor
did
he
think
that
responsible
statesmen
at
home
had
any
such
arrangement
in
view
that
such
an
arrangement
was
in
contemplation
a
few
years
ago
i
knew
from
competent
authority
perhaps
the
unexpected
interest
which
the
english
people
have
lately
shown
in
the
colonies
has
modified
opinion
in
those
high
circles
and
has
taught
politicians
that
they
must
advance
more
cautiously
but
the
wind
still
sits
in
the
old
quarter
three
years
ago
the
constitution
in
jamaica
was
partially
a
franchise
was
conceded
both
there
and
in
barbadoes
which
gave
every
black
householder
a
vote
even
in
poor
dominica
an
extended
suffrage
was
hung
out
as
a
remedy
for
its
wretchedness
if
nothing
further
is
intended
these
concessions
have
been
gratuitously
mischievous
it
has
roused
the
hopes
of
political
agitators
not
in
jamaica
only
but
all
over
the
antilles
it
has
taught
the
people
who
have
no
grievances
at
all
who
in
their
present
state
are
better
protected
than
any
peasantry
in
the
world
except
the
irish
to
look
to
political
changes
as
a
road
to
an
impossible
millennium
it
has
rekindled
hopes
which
had
been
long
extinguished
that
like
their
brothers
in
hayti
they
were
on
the
way
to
have
the
islands
to
themselves
it
has
alienated
the
english
colonists
filled
them
with
the
worst
apprehensions
and
taught
them
to
look
wistfully
from
their
own
country
to
a
union
with
america
a
few
elected
members
in
a
council
where
they
may
be
counterbalanced
by
an
equal
number
of
official
members
seems
a
small
thing
in
itself
so
long
as
the
equality
was
maintained
my
yankee
friend
was
still
willing
to
risk
his
capital
in
jamaican
enterprises
but
the
principle
has
been
allowed
the
existing
arrangement
is
a
which
satisfies
none
and
irritates
all
and
collisions
between
the
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
nominees
of
the
government
are
only
avoided
by
leaving
a
sufficient
number
of
official
seats
unfilled
to
have
upon
a
road
where
you
can
not
stand
still
where
retreat
is
impossible
and
where
to
go
forward
can
only
be
recommended
on
the
hypothesis
that
to
give
a
man
a
vote
will
itself
qualify
him
for
the
use
of
it
has
been
one
of
the
minor
achievements
of
the
last
government
of
gladstone
and
is
likely
to
be
as
successful
as
his
larger
exploits
nearer
home
have
as
yet
proved
to
be
a
supreme
court
were
we
happy
enough
to
possess
such
a
thing
would
forbid
these
venturous
experiments
of
sanguine
statesmen
who
may
happen
for
a
moment
to
command
a
trifling
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
i
could
not
say
what
i
felt
completely
to
sir
henry
who
perhaps
had
been
in
personal
relations
with
gladstone
government
perhaps
too
he
was
one
of
those
numerous
persons
of
tried
ability
and
intelligence
who
have
only
a
faint
belief
that
the
connection
between
great
britain
and
the
colonies
can
be
of
long
continuance
the
public
may
amuse
themselves
with
the
vision
of
an
imperial
union
practical
statesmen
who
are
aware
of
the
tendencies
of
communities
to
follow
lines
of
their
own
in
which
the
mother
country
can
not
support
them
may
believe
that
they
know
it
to
be
impossible
as
to
the
west
indies
there
are
but
two
genuine
alternatives
one
to
leave
them
to
themselves
to
shape
their
own
destinies
as
we
leave
australia
the
other
to
govern
them
as
if
they
were
a
part
of
great
britain
with
the
same
scrupulous
care
of
the
people
and
their
interests
with
which
we
govern
bengal
madras
and
bombay
england
is
responsible
for
the
social
condition
of
those
islands
she
filled
them
with
negroes
when
it
was
her
interest
to
maintain
slavery
she
emancipated
those
negroes
when
popular
opinion
at
home
demanded
that
slavery
should
end
it
appears
to
me
that
england
ought
to
bear
the
consequences
of
her
own
actions
and
assume
to
herself
the
responsibilities
of
a
state
of
things
which
she
has
herself
created
we
are
partly
unwilling
to
take
the
trouble
partly
we
cling
to
the
popular
belief
that
to
trust
all
countries
with
the
care
of
their
own
concerns
is
the
way
to
raise
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
and
to
make
them
happy
and
contented
we
dimly
perceive
that
the
population
of
the
west
indies
is
not
a
natural
growth
of
internal
tendencies
and
circumstances
and
we
therefore
hesitate
before
we
plunge
completely
and
entirely
into
the
downward
course
but
we
play
with
it
we
drift
towards
it
we
advance
as
far
as
we
dare
giving
them
the
evils
of
both
systems
and
the
advantages
of
neither
at
the
same
moment
we
extend
the
suffrage
to
the
blacks
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
we
refuse
to
our
own
people
the
benefit
of
a
treaty
which
would
have
rescued
them
from
imminent
ruin
and
brought
them
into
relations
with
their
powerful
kindred
close
at
hand
relations
which
might
save
them
from
the
most
dangerous
consequences
of
a
negro
political
supremacy
and
the
result
is
that
the
english
in
those
islands
are
melting
away
and
will
soon
be
crowded
out
or
will
have
departed
of
themselves
in
disgust
a
policy
so
and
affecting
so
seriously
the
condition
of
the
oldest
of
our
colonial
possessions
ought
not
to
have
been
adopted
on
their
own
authority
by
doctrinaire
statesmen
in
a
cabinet
without
fully
and
frankly
consulting
the
english
nation
and
no
further
step
ought
to
be
taken
in
that
direction
until
the
nation
has
had
the
circumstances
of
the
islands
laid
before
it
and
has
pronounced
one
way
or
the
other
its
own
sovereign
pleasure
does
or
does
not
england
desire
that
her
own
people
shall
be
enabled
to
live
and
thrive
in
the
west
indies
if
she
decides
that
her
hands
are
too
full
that
she
is
and
can
not
attend
to
them
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
but
if
this
is
her
resolution
the
hands
of
the
west
indians
ought
to
be
untied
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
make
their
sugar
treaties
to
make
any
treaties
to
enter
into
the
closest
relations
with
america
which
the
americans
will
accept
as
the
only
chance
which
will
be
left
them
such
abandonment
however
will
bring
us
no
honour
it
will
not
further
that
federation
of
the
british
empire
which
so
many
of
us
now
profess
to
desire
if
we
wish
australia
and
canada
to
draw
into
closer
union
with
us
it
will
not
be
by
showing
that
we
are
unable
to
manage
a
group
of
colonies
which
are
almost
at
our
doors
englishmen
all
round
the
globe
have
rejoiced
together
in
this
year
which
is
passing
by
us
over
the
greatness
of
their
inheritance
and
have
celebrated
with
enthusiasm
the
during
which
our
has
reigned
over
the
english
world
unity
and
federation
are
on
our
lips
and
we
have
our
leagues
and
our
institutes
and
in
the
eagerness
of
our
wishes
we
dream
that
we
see
the
fulfilment
of
them
neither
the
kingdom
of
heaven
nor
any
other
kingdom
with
observation
it
comes
not
with
speeches
however
eloquent
or
with
flowing
sentiments
however
for
the
moment
sincere
the
spirit
which
made
the
empire
can
alone
hold
it
together
the
american
union
was
not
saved
by
oratory
it
was
saved
by
the
determination
of
the
bravest
of
the
people
it
was
cemented
by
the
blood
which
dyed
the
slopes
of
gettysburg
the
union
of
the
british
empire
if
it
is
to
be
more
than
a
dream
can
continue
only
while
the
attracting
force
of
the
primary
commands
the
willing
attendance
of
the
distant
satellites
let
the
magnet
lose
its
power
let
the
confidence
of
the
colonies
in
the
strength
and
resolution
of
their
central
orb
be
once
shaken
and
the
centrifugal
force
will
sweep
them
away
into
orbits
of
their
own
the
race
of
men
who
now
inhabit
this
island
of
ours
show
no
signs
of
degeneracy
the
bow
of
ulysses
is
sound
as
ever
moths
and
worms
have
not
injured
either
cord
or
horn
but
it
is
unstrung
and
the
arrows
which
are
shot
from
it
drop
feebly
to
the
ground
the
irish
python
rises
again
out
of
its
swamp

no

days
when
i
was
ignorant
and
unjust
i
struck
you
down

bound
you
i
left
officers

with
you
of
my

to
watch
you

that

from

every
creature
has
a
right

live
according

i
was
a
tyrant
and
you
did
well
to
resist
i
ask
you
to
forgive
and
forget
i
set
you
free
i
hand
you
over
my

representatives
as
a

of
my
goodwill
that
you
may

at
your
leisure
they
have
been
the
instruments
of
my
oppression
consume
them
destroy
them
do
what
you
will
with
them
and
henceforward
i
hope
that
we
shall
live
together
as
friends
and
that
you
will
show
yourself
worthy
of
my
generosity
and
of
the
freedom
which
you
have
so
gloriously
won
a

the
eloquence
of

of

but
he
would
not
be

who
would
command
the
willing
confidence
of

great
britain
will
make
the
tie
which
holds
the
colonies
to
her
a
real
one
when
she
shows
them
and
shows
the
world
that
she
is
still
equal
to
her
great
place
that
her
arm
is
not
shortened
and
her
heart
has
not
grown
faint
men
speak
of
the
sacredness

talk

guide
that
allegiance
is
due
only
to
majorities
that
allegiance
of

kind
is
base
and
a
relic
of
servitude
the
americans
are
the

people
in

in
their
freedom
they
have
to
obey
the
fundamental
laws
of

motley

a

to

to

as

no

at

it

with

to
be

why
should

continue
loyal
when
my
loyalty
was
so
contemptuously
valued
but
i
will
not
believe
that
it

come

this
an
englishman
may
be
heavily
tempted
but
in
evil
fortune
as
in
good
his
heart
is
in
the
old
place
the
administration
of
our
affairs
is
taken
for
the
present
from
prudent
statesmen
and
is
made
over
to
those
who
know
how
best
to
flatter
the
people
with
sentiments
and
idle
adulation
all
sovereigns
have
been
undone
by
flatterers
the
people
are
sovereign
now
and
being
new
to
power
listen
to
those
who
feed
their
vanity
the
popular
orator
has
been
the
ruin
of
every
country
which
has
trusted
to
him
he
never
speaks
an
unwelcome
truth
for
his
existence
depends
on
pleasing
and
he
cares
only
to
tickle
the
ears
of
his
audience
his
element
is
anarchy
his
function
is
to
undo
what
better
men
have
done
in
wind
he
lives
and
moves
and
has
his
being
when
the
gods
are
angry
he
can
raise
it
to
a
hurricane
and
lay
waste
whole
nations
in
ruin

full
of

not

he
make
a

the

question
which
the
constituencies
ask
when
a
candidate
is
offered
to
their
suffrages
when
the
roman
commonwealth
developed
from
an
aristocratic
republic
into
a
democracy
and
as
now
with
us
the
sovereignty
was
in
the
mass
of
the
people
the
oratorical
faculty
came
to
the
front
in
the
same
way
the
finest
speaker
was
esteemed
the
fittest
man
to
be
made
a
consul
or
a
prætor
of
and
there
were
schools
of
rhetoric
where
aspirants
for
office
had
to
go
to
learn
gesture
and
intonation
before
they
could
present
themselves
at
the
hustings
the
sovereign
people
and
their
orators
could
do
much
but
they
could
not
alter
facts
or
make
that
which
was
not
to
be
or
that
which
was
not
to
be
the
orators
could
perorate
and
the
people
could
decree
but
facts
remained
and
facts
proved
the
strongest
and
the
end
of
that
was
that
after
a
short
supremacy
the
empire
which
they
had
brought
to
the
edge
of
ruin
was
saved
at
the
last
extremity
the
sovereign
people
lost
their
liberties
and
the
tongues
of
political
orators
were
silenced
for
centuries
illusion

man
and
they
were
victorious
over
them
all
they
won
for
britannia
the
sceptre
of
the
sea
and
built
up
the
empire
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
to
us
their
successors
they
handed
down
the
splendid
inheritance
and
we
in
turn
have
invented
steam
ships
and
telegraphs
and
thrown
bridges
over
the
ocean
and
made
our
possessions
as
easy
of
access
as
the
next
parish
the
attractive
force
of
the
primary
ought
to
have
increased
in
the
same
ratio
but
we
do
not
find
that
it
has
and
the
centrifugal
and
the
centripetal
tendencies
of
our
satellites
are
year
by
year
becoming
more
nicely
balanced
these
beautiful
west
indian
islands
were
intended
to
be
homes
for
the
overflowing
numbers
of
our
own
race
and
the
few
that
have
gone
there
are
being
crowded
out
by
the
blacks
from
jamaica
and
the
antilles
our
poor
helots
at
home
drag
on
their
lives
in
the
lanes
and
alleys
of
our
choking
cities
and
of
those
who
gather
heart
to
break
off
on
their
own
account
and
seek
elsewhere
for
a
land
of
promise
the
large
majority
are
weary
of
the
flag
under
which
they
have
only
known
suffering
and
prefer
america
to
the
english
colonies
they
are
waking
now
to
understand
the
opportunities
which
are
slipping
through
their
hands
has
the
awakening
come
too
late
we
have
ourselves
mixed
the
cup
must
we
now
drink
it
the
dregs
it
is
too
late
to
enable
us
to
make
homes
in
the
west
indies
for
the
swarms
who
are
thrown
off
by
our
own
towns
and
villages
we
might
have
done
it
englishmen
would
have
thriven
as
well
in
jamaica
and
the
antilles
as
the
spaniards
have
thriven
in
cuba
but
the
islands
are
now
peopled
by
men
of
another
colour
the
whites
there
are
as
units
among
hundreds
and
the
proportion
can
not
be
altered
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
redeem
our
own
responsibilities
we
brought
the
blacks
there
we
have
as
yet
not
done
much
for
their
improvement
when
their
notions
of
morality
are
still
so
elementary
that
more
than
half
of
their
children
are
born
out
of
marriage
the
english
planters
were
encouraged
to
settle
there
when
it
suited
our
convenience
to
maintain
the
islands
for
imperial
purposes
like
the
landlords
in
ireland
they
were
our
english
garrison
and
as
with
the
landlords
in
ireland
when
we
imagine
that
they
have
served
their
purpose
and
can
be
no
longer
of
use
to
us
we
calmly
change
the
conditions
of
society
we
disclaim
obligations
to
help
them
in
the
confusion
which
we
have
introduced
we
tell
them
to
help
themselves
and
they
can
not
help
themselves
in
such
an
element
as
that
in
which
they
are
now
struggling
unless
they
know
that
they
may
count
on
the
sympathy
and
the
support
of
their
countrymen
at
home
nothing
is
demanded
of
the
english
exchequer
the
resources
of
the
islands
are
practically
boundless
there
is
a
robust
population
conscious
at
the
bottom
of
their
native
inferiority
and
docile
and
willing
to
work
if
anyone
will
direct
them
and
set
them
to
it
there
will
be
capital
enough
forthcoming
and
energetic
men
enough
and
intelligence
enough
if
we
on
our
part
will
provide
one
thing
the
easiest
of
all
if
we
really
set
our
minds
to
it
an
effective
and
authoritative
government
it
is
not
safe
even
for
ourselves
to
leave
a
wound
unattended
to
though
it
be
in
the
least
significant
part
of
our
bodies
the
west
indies
are
a
small
limb
in
the
great
body
corporate
of
the
british
empire
but
there
is
no
great
and
no
small
in
the
life
of
nations
the
avoidable
decay
of
the
smallest
member
is
an
injury
to
the
whole
let
it
be
once
known
and
felt
that
england
regards
the
west
indies
as
essentially
one
with
herself
and
the
english
in
the
islands
will
resume
their
natural
position
and
respect
and
order
will
come
back
and
those
once
thriving
colonies
will
again
advance
with
the
rest
on
the
high
road
of
civilisation
and
prosperity
let
it
be
known
that
england
considers
only
her
immediate
interests
and
will
not
exert
herself
and
the
other
colonies
will
know
what
they
have
to
count
upon
and
the
british
empire
will
dwindle
down
before
long
into
a
single
insignificant
island
in
the
north
sea
so
end
the
reflections
which
i
formed
there
from
what
i
saw
and
what
i
heard
i
have
written
as
an
outside
observer
unconnected
with
practical
politics
with
no
motive
except
a
loyal
pride
in
the
greatness
of
my
own
country
and
a
conviction
which
i
will
not
believe
to
be
a
dream
that
the
destinies
have
still
in
store
for
her
a
yet
grander
future
the
units
of
us
come
and
go
the
british
empire
the
globe
itself
and
all
that
it
inherits
will
pass
away

but
that

can
not

out

the
now
fragments
may
yet
be
formed
one
living
imperial
power
with
a
new
era
of
beneficence
and
usefulness
to
mankind
the
english
people
are
spread
far
and
wide
the
sea
is
their
dominion
and
their
land
is
the
finest
portion
of
the

it
is

now
it
will
be
theirs
for
ages
to
come
if
they
remain
themselves
unchanged
and
keep
the
heart
and
temper
of
their
forefathers
naught
shall
make
us

to

how
perfect
the
description
how
exactly
in
those
eight
words
euripides
draws
the
picture
of
the
ocean
the
long
grey
heaving
swell
the
darker
on
the
shadowed
slope
of
the
surface
waves
and
the
foam
on
their
breaking
crests
our
thoughts
flow
back
as
we
gaze
to
the
times
long
ago
when
the
earth
belonged
to
other
races
as
it
now
belongs
to
us
the
ocean
is
the
same
as
it
was
their
eyes
saw
it
as
we
see
it
time
writes
no
wrinkle
on
that
azure
brow
nor
is
the
ocean
alone
the
same
human
nature
is
still
vexed
with
the
same
problems
mocked
with
the
same
hopes
wandering
after
the
same
illusions
the
sea
affected
the
greeks
as
it
affects
us
and
was
equally
dear
to
them
it
was
a
greek
who
said
sea
washes
off
all
the
ills
of
men
the
one
as
æschylus
called
it
the
eternally
pure
on
long
voyages
i
take
greeks
as
my
best
companions
i
had
plato
with
me
on
my
way
home
from
the
west
indies
he
lived
and
wrote
in
an
age
like
ours
when
religion
had
become
a
debatable
subject
on
which
every
one
had
his
opinion
and
democracy
was
master
of
the
civilised
world
and
the
mediterranean
states
were
running
wild
after
liberty
preparatory
to
the
bursting
of
the
bubble
looking
out
on
such
a
world
plato
left
thoughts
behind
him
the
very
language
of
which
is
as
full
of
application
to
our
own
larger
world
as
if
it
was
written
yesterday
it
throws
light
on
small
things
as
well
as
large
and
interprets
alike
the
condition
of
the
islands
which
i
had
left
the
condition
of
england
the
condition
of
all
civilised
countries
in
this
modern
epoch
the
chief
characteristic
of
this
age
as
it
was
the
chief
characteristic
of
plato
is
the
struggle
for
what
we
call
the
of
man
in
other
times
the
thing
insisted
on
was
that
men
should
do
what
was
as
something
due
to
a
higher
authority
now
the
demand
is
for
what
is
called
their
as
something
due
to
themselves
and
among
these
rights
is
a
right
to
liberty
liberty
meaning
the
utmost
possible
freedom
of
every
man
consistent
with
the
freedom
of
others
and
the
abolition
of
every
kind
of
authority
of
one
man
over
another
it
is
with
this
view
that
we
have
introduced
popular
suffrage
that
we
give
everyone
a
vote
or
aim
at
giving
it
as
the
highest
political
perfection
we
turn
to
plato
and
we
find
a
healthy
community
there
ought
to
be
some
authority
over
every
single
man
and
woman
no
person
not
one
ought
to
act
on
his
or
her
judgment
alone
even
in
the
smallest
trifle
the
soldier
on
a
campaign
obeys
his
commander
in
little
things
as
well
as
great
the
safety
of
the
army
requires
it
but
it
is
in
peace
as
it
is
in
war
and
there
is
no
difference
every
person
should
be
trained
from
childhood
to
rule
and
to
be
ruled
so
only
can
the
life
of
man
and
the
life
of
all
creatures
dependent
on
him
be
delivered
from
anarchy
it
is
worth
while
to
observe
how
diametrically
opposite
to
our
notions
on
this
subject
were
the
notions
of
a
man
of
the
finest
intellect
with
the
fullest
opportunities
of
observation
and
every
one
of
whose
estimates
of
things
was
confirmed
by
the
event
such
a
discipline
as
he
recommends
never
existed
in
any
community
of
men
except
perhaps
among
the
religious
orders
in
the
enthusiasm
of
their
first
institution
nor
would
a
society
be
long
tolerable
in
which
it
was
tried
communities
however
have
existed
where
people
have
thought
more
of
their
obligations
than
of
their
more
of
the
welfare
of
their
country
or
of
the
success
of
a
cause
to
which
they
have
devoted
themselves
than
of
their
personal
pleasure
or
interest
have
preferred
the
wise
leading
of
superior
men
to
their
own
wills
and
wishes
nay
perhaps
no
community
has
ever
continued
long
or
has
made
a
mark
in
the
world
of
serious
significance
where
society
has
not
been
graduated
in
degrees
and
there
have
not
been
deeper
and
stronger
bands
of
coherence
than
the
fluctuating
votes
of
majorities
times
are
changed
we
are
told
we
live
in
a
new
era
when
public
opinion
is
king
and
no
other
rule
is
possible
public
opinion
as
expressed
in
the
press
and
on
the
platform
and
by
the
deliberately
chosen
representatives
of
the
people
every
question
can
be
discussed
and
argued
all
sides
of
it
can
be
heard
and
the
nation
makes
up
its
mind
the
collective
judgment
of
all
is
wiser
than
the
wisest
single
man
judicat
give
the
public
time
and
i
believe
this
to
be
true
general
opinion
does
in
the
long
run
form
a
right
estimate
of
most
persons
and
of
most
things
as
surely
its
immediate
impulses
are
almost
invariably
in
directions
which
it
afterwards
regrets
and
repudiates
and
therefore
constitutions
which
have
no
surer
basis
than
the
popular
judgment
as
it
shifts
from
year
to
year
or
parliament
to
parliament
are
built
on
foundations
looser
than
sand
in
concluding
this
book
i
have
a
few
more
words
to
say
on
the
subject
so
ardently
canvassed
of
imperial
federation
it
seems
so
easy
you
have
only
to
form
a
new
parliament
in
which
the
colonies
shall
be
represented
according
to
numbers
while
each
colony
will
retain
its
own
for
its
own
local
purposes
local
administration
is
demanded
everywhere
england
scotland
wales
ireland
can
each
have
theirs
and
the
vexed
question
of
home
rule
can
be
disposed
of
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
whole
a
central
parliament
can
then
be
formed
in
which
the
parts
can
all
be
represented
in
proportion
to
their
number
and
a
cabinet
can
be
selected
out
of
this
for
the
management
of
imperial
concerns
nothing
more
is
necessary
the
thing
will
be
done
so
in
a
hundred
forms
but
all
on
the
same
principle
schemes
of
imperial
union
have
fallen
under
my
eye
i
should
myself
judge
from
experience
of
what
democratically
elected
parliaments
are
growing
into
that
at
the
first
session
of
such
a
body
the
satellites
would
fly
off
into
space
shattered
perhaps
themselves
in
the
process
we
have
parliaments
enough
already
and
if
no
better
device
can
be
found
than
by
adding
another
to
the
number
the
rash
spirit
of
innovation
has
not
yet
gone
far
enough
to
fling
our
ancient
constitution
into
the
crucible
on
so
wild
a
chance
imperial
federation
as
it
is
called
is
far
away
if
ever
it
is
to
be
realised
at
all
if
it
is
to
come
it
will
come
of
itself
brought
about
by
circumstances
and
silent
impulses
working
continuously
through
many
years
unseen
and
unspoken
of
it
is
conceivable
that
great
britain
and
her
scattered
offspring
under
the
pressure
of
danger
from
without
or
impelled
by
some
general
purpose
might
agree
to
place
themselves
for
a
time
under
a
single
administrative
head
it
is
conceivable
that
out
of
a
combination
so
formed
if
it
led
to
a
successful
immediate
result
some
union
of
a
closer
kind
might
eventually
emerge
it
is
not
only
conceivable
but
it
is
entirely
certain
that
attempts
made
when
no
such
occasion
has
arisen
by
politicians
ambitious
of
distinguishing
themselves
will
fail
and
in
failing
will
make
the
object
that
is
aimed
at
more
confessedly
unattainable
than
it
is
now
the
present
relation
between
the
mother
country
and
her
colonies
is
partly
that
of
parent
and
children
who
have
grown
to
maturity
and
are
taking
care
of
themselves
partly
of
independent
nations
in
friendly
alliance
partly
as
common
subjects
of
the
same
sovereign
whose
authority
is
exercised
in
each
by
ministers
of
its
own
neither
of
these
analogies
is
exact
for
the
position
alters
from
year
to
year
so
much
the
better
the
relation
which
now
exists
can
not
be
more
than
provisional
let
us
not
try
to
shape
it
artificially
after
a
pattern
the
threads
of
interest
and
kindred
must
be
left
to
spin
themselves
in
their
own
way
meanwhile
we
can
work
together
heartily
and
with
good
will
where
we
need
each
other
difficulties
will
rise
perhaps
from
time
to
time
but
we
can
meet
them
as
they
come
and
we
need
not
anticipate
them
if
we
are
to
be
politically
one
the
organic
fibres
which
connect
us
are
as
yet
too
immature
to
bear
a
strain
all
that
we
can
do
and
all
that
at
present
we
ought
to
try
is
to
act
generously
whenever
our
assistance
can
be
of
use
the
disposition
of
english
statesmen
to
draw
closer
to
the
colonies
is
of
recent
growth
they
can
not
tell
and
we
can
not
tell
how
far
it
indicates
a
real
change
of
attitude
or
is
merely
a
passing
mood
one
thing
however
we
ought
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
colonies
sympathise
one
with
another
and
that
wrong
or
neglect
in
any
part
of
the
empire
does
not
escape
notice
the
larger
colonies
desire
to
know
what
the
recent
professions
of
interest
are
worth
and
they
look
keenly
at
our
treatment
of
their
younger
brothers
who
are
still
in
our
power
they
are
practical
they
attend
to
results
they
guard
jealously
their
own
privileges
but
they
are
not
so
enamoured
of
constitutional
theory
that
they
will
patiently
see
their
in
less
favoured
situations
swamped
under
the
votes
of
the
coloured
races
australians
canadians
new
zealanders
will
not
be
found
enthusiastic
for
the
extension
of
in
the
west
indies
when
they
know
that
it
means
the
extinction
of
their
own
white
brothers
who
have
settled
there
the
placing
english
colonists
at
the
mercy
of
coloured
majorities
they
will
resent
as
an
injury
to
themselves
they
will
not
look
upon
it
as
an
extension
of
a
generous
principle
but
as
an
act
of
airy
virtue
which
costs
us
nothing
and
at
the
bottom
is
but
carelessness
and
indifference
we
imagine
that
we
have
seen
the
errors
of
our
old
colonial
policy
and
that
we
are
in
no
danger
of
repeating
them
yet
in
the
west
indies
we
are
treading
over
again
the
too
familiar
road
the
colonists
in
petitioned
for
a
union
with
great
britain
a
union
would
have
involved
a
share
in
british
trade
it
was
refused
therefore
and
we
gave
them
the
penal
laws
instead
they
set
up
manufactures
built
ships
and
tried
to
raise
a
commerce
of
their
own
we
laid
them
under
disabilities
which
ruined
their
enterprises
and
when
they
were
resentful
and
became
troublesome
we
turned
round
to
the
native
irish
and
made
a
virtue
of
protecting
them
against
our
own
people
whom
we
had
injured
when
the
penal
laws
ceased
to
be
useful
to
us
we
did
not
allow
them
to
be
executed
we
played
off
catholic
against
protestant
while
we
were
sacrificing
both
to
our
own
jealousy
having
made
the
government
of
the
island
impossible
for
those
whom
we
had
planted
there
to
govern
it
we
emancipate
the
governed
and
to
conciliate
them
we
allow
them
to
appropriate
the
possessions
of
their
late
masters
and
we
have
not
conciliated
the
native
irish
it
was
impossible
that
we
should
we
have
simply
armed
them
with
the
only
weapons
which
enable
them
to
revenge
their
wrongs
upon
us
the
history
of
the
west
indies
is
a
precise
parallel
the
islands
were
necessary
to
our
safety
in
our
struggle
with
france
and
spain
the
colonists
held
them
chiefly
for
us
as
a
garrison
and
we
in
turn
gave
the
colonists
their
slaves
the
white
settlers
ruled
as
in
ireland
the
slaves
obeyed
and
all
went
swimmingly
times
changed
at
home
slavery
became
unpopular
it
was
abolished
and
with
a
generosity
for
which
we
never
ceased
to
applaud
ourselves
we
voted
an
indemnity
of
twenty
millions
to
the
owners
we
imagined
that
we
had
acquitted
our
consciences
but
such
debts
are
not
discharged
by
payments
of
money
we
had
introduced
the
slaves
into
the
islands
for
our
own
advantage
in
setting
them
free
we
revolutionised
society
we
remained
still
responsible
for
the
social
consequences
and
we
did
not
choose
to
remember
it
the
planters
were
guilty
only
like
the
irish
landlords
of
having
ceased
to
be
necessary
to
us
we
practised
our
virtues
vicariously
at
their
expense
we
had
the
praise
and
honour
they
had
the
suffering
they
begged
that
the
emancipation
might
be
gradual
our
impatience
to
clear
our
reputation
refused
to
wait
their
system
of
cultivation
being
deranged
they
petitioned
for
protection
against
the
competition
of
countries
where
slavery
continued
the
request
was
natural
but
could
not
be
listened
to
because
to
grant
it
might
raise
infinitesimally
the
cost
of
the
british
workman
breakfast
they
struggled
on
and
even
when
a
new
rival
rose
in
the
beetroot
sugar
they
refused
to
be
beaten
the
european
powers
to
save
their
beetroot
went
on
to
support
it
with
a
bounty
against
the
purse
of
foreign
governments
the
sturdiest
individuals
can
not
compete
defeated
in
a
fight
which
had
become
unfair
the
planters
looked
and
looked
in
vain
to
their
own
government
for
help
finding
none
they
turned
to
their
kindred
in
the
united
states
and
there
at
last
they
found
a
hand
held
out
to
them
the
americans
were
willing
though
at
a
loss
of
two
millions
and
a
half
of
revenue
to
admit
the
poor
west
indians
to
their
own
market
but
a
commercial
treaty
was
necessary
and
a
treaty
could
not
be
made
without
the
sanction
of
the
english
government
the
english
government
on
some
crotchet
refused
to
colonies
which
were
weak
and
helpless
what
they
would
have
granted
without
a
word
if
demanded
by
victoria
or
new
south
wales
whose
resentment
they
feared
and
when
the
west
indians
harassed
desperate
and
half
ruined
cried
out
against
the
enormous
injustice
in
the
fear
that
their
indignation
might
affect
their
allegiance
and
lead
them
to
seek
admission
into
the
american
union
we
extend
the
franchise
among
the
blacks
on
whose
hostility
to
such
a
measure
we
know
that
we
can
rely
there
is
no
occasion
to
suspect
responsible
english
politicians
of
any
sinister
purpose
in
what
they
have
done
or
not
done
or
suspect
them
indeed
of
any
purpose
at
all
they
act
from
day
to
day
under
the
pressure
of
each
exigency
as
it
rises
and
they
choose
the
course
which
is
least
directly
inconvenient
but
the
result
is
to
have
created
in
the
antilles
and
jamaica
so
many
fresh
irelands
and
i
believe
that
british
colonists
the
world
over
will
feel
together
in
these
questions
they
will
not
approve
rather
they
will
combine
to
condemn
the
betrayal
of
their
own
if
england
desires
her
colonies
to
rally
round
her
she
must
deserve
their
affection
and
deserve
their
respect
she
will
find
neither
one
nor
the
other
if
she
carelessly
sacrifices
her
own
people
in
any
part
of
the
world
to
fear
or
convenience
the
magnetism
which
will
bind
them
to
her
must
be
found
in
herself
or
nowhere
perhaps
nowhere
perhaps
if
we
look
to
the
real
origin
of
all
that
has
gone
wrong
with
us
of
the
policy
which
has
flung
ireland
back
into
anarchy
which
has
weakened
our
influence
abroad
which
has
ruined
the
oldest
of
our
colonies
and
has
made
the
continuance
under
our
flag
of
the
great
communities
of
our
countrymen
who
are
forming
new
nations
in
the
pacific
a
question
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
we
shall
find
it
in
our
own
distractions
in
the
form
of
government
which
is
fast
developing
into
a
civil
war
under
the
semblance
of
peace
where
party
is
more
than
country
and
a
victory
at
the
hustings
over
a
candidate
of
opposite
principles
more
glorious
than
a
victory
in
the
field
over
a
foreign
foe
society
in
republican
rome
was
so
much
interested
in
the
faction
fights
of
clodius
and
milo
that
it
could
hear
with
apathy
of
the
destruction
of
crassus
and
a
roman
army
the
senate
would
have
sold
cæsar
to
the
celtic
chiefs
in
gaul
and
the
modern
english
enthusiast
would
disintegrate
the
british
islands
to
purchase
the
irish
vote
till
we
can
rise
into
some
nobler
sphere
of
thought
and
conduct
we
may
lay
aside
the
vision
of
a
confederated
empire
oh
england
model
to
thy
inward
greatness
like
little
body
with
a
mighty
heart
what
thou
do
that
honour
would
thee
do
were
all
thy
children
kind
and
natural
footnotes
i
believe
this
to
be
the
true

of
