this
invisible
playmate

dearest
by
beam
piper
colonel
ashley
hampton
chewed
his
cigar
and
forced
himself
to
relax
his
glance
slowly
traversing
the
room
lingering
on
the
mosaic
of
in
the
tall
cases
the
sunlight
splashed
on
the
faded
pastel
colors
of
the
carpet
the
autumn
landscape
outside
the
french
windows
the
trophies
of
indian
and
filipino
and
german
weapons
on
the
walls
he
could
easily
feign
relaxation
here
in
the
library
of
greyrock
as
long
as
he
looked
only
at
these
familiar
inanimate
things
and
avoided
the
five
people
gathered
in
the
room
with
him
for
all
of
them
were
enemies
there
was
his
nephew
stephen
hampton
greying
at
the
temples
but
youthfully
dressed
in
leaning
with
obvious
if
slightly
premature
proprietorship
against
the
fireplace
a
in
his
hand
there
was
myra
stephen
smart
blonde
wife
reclining
in
a
chair
beside
the
desk
for
these
two
he
felt
an
implacable
hatred
the
others
were
no
less
enemies
perhaps
more
dangerous
enemies
but
they
were
only
the
tools
of
stephen
and
myra
for
instance
barnwell
powell
prim
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
clutching
the
briefcase
on
his
lap
as
though
it
were
a
restless
pet
which
might
attempt
to
escape
he
was
an
honest
man
as
lawyers
went
painfully
ethical
no
doubt
he
had
convinced
himself
that
his
clients
were
acting
from
the
noblest
and
most
disinterested
motives
and
doctor
alexis
vehrner
with
his
vandyke
beard
and
his
viennese
accent
as
phony
as
a
election
who
had
preempted
the
chair
at
colonel
hampton
desk
that
rankled
the
old
soldier
but
doctor
vehrner
would
want
to
assume
the
position
which
would
give
him
appearance
of
commanding
the
situation
and
he
probably
felt
that
colonel
hampton
was
no
longer
the
master
of
greyrock
the
fifth
a
neanderthal
type
in
a
white
jacket
was
doctor
attendant
and
bodyguard
he
could
be
ignored
like
an
enlisted
man
unthinkingly
obeying
the
orders
of
a
superior
but
you
are
not
cooperating
colonel
hampton
the
psychiatrist
complained
how
can
i
help
you
if
you
do
not
cooperate
colonel
hampton
took
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
his
white
mustache
tinged
a
faint
yellow
by
habitual
smoking
twitched
angrily
oh
you
call
it
helping
me
do
you
he
asked
acidly
but
why
else
am
i
here
the
doctor
parried
you
here
because
my
loving
nephew
and
his
charming
wife
ca
wait
to
see
me
buried
in
the
family
cemetery
they
want
to
bury
me
alive
in
that
private
bedlam
of
yours
colonel
hampton
replied
see
myra
hampton
turned
to
the
psychiatrist
we
are
him
we
are
all
of
him
we
are
him
of
course
this
sullen
and
suspicious
silence
is
a
common
paranoid
symptom
one
often
finds
such
symptoms
in
cases
of
senile
dementia
doctor
vehrner
agreed
colonel
hampton
snorted
contemptuously
senile
dementia
well
he
must
have
been
senile
and
demented
to
bring
this
pair
of
snakes
into
his
home
because
he
felt
an
obligation
to
his
dead
brother
memory
and
he
willed
greyrock
and
his
money
and
everything
to
stephen
only
myra
could
wait
till
he
died
she
her
husband
into
this
insanity
accusation
however
i
must
fully
satisfy
myself
before
i
can
sign
the
commitment
the
psychiatrist
was
saying
after
all
the
patient
is
a
man
of
advanced
age
to
be
exact
almost
eighty
colonel
hampton
could
hardly
realize
that
he
had
been
around
so
long
he
had
been
a
little
boy
playing
soldiers
he
had
been
a
young
man
breaking
the
family
tradition
of
harvard
and
wangling
an
appointment
to
west
point
he
had
been
a
new
second
lieutenant
at
a
little
post
in
wyoming
in
the
last
dying
flicker
of
the
indian
wars
he
had
been
a
first
lieutenant
trying
to
make
soldiers
of
militiamen
and
hoping
for
orders
to
cuba
before
the
spaniards
gave
up
he
had
been
the
captain
of
a
company
fighting
moros
in
the
jungles
of
mindanao
then
through
the
early
years
of
the
twentieth
century
after
his
father
death
he
had
been
that
in
the
american
service
a
really
wealthy
professional
officer
he
had
played
polo
and
served
a
turn
as
military
attache
at
the
paris
embassy
he
had
commanded
a
regiment
in
france
in
and
in
the
years
had
rounded
out
his
service
in
command
of
a
regiment
of
negro
cavalry
before
retiring
to
greyrock
too
old
for
active
service
or
even
a
desk
at
the
pentagon
he
had
drilled
a
home
guard
company
of
and
boys
and
paunchy
through
the
second
world
war
then
he
had
been
an
old
man
sitting
alone
in
the
sunlight
until
a
wonderful
thing
had
happened
get
him
to
tell
you
about
this
invisible
playmate
of
his
stephen
suggested
if
that
wo
satisfy
you
i
do
know
what
will
it
had
begun
a
year
ago
last
june
he
had
been
sitting
on
a
bench
on
the
east
lawn
watching
a
kitten
playing
with
a
crumpled
bit
of
paper
on
the
walk
circling
warily
around
it
as
though
it
were
some
living
prey
stalking
cautiously
pouncing
and
striking
the
paper
ball
with
a
paw
and
then
pursuing
it
madly
the
kitten
whose
name
was
smokeball
was
a
friend
of
his
soon
she
would
tire
of
her
game
and
jump
up
beside
him
to
be
petted
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
hear
a
girl
voice
beside
him
oh
what
a
darling
little
cat
what
its
name
smokeball
he
said
without
thinking
she
about
the
color
of
a
then
he
stopped
short
looking
about
there
was
nobody
in
sight
and
he
realized
that
the
voice
had
been
inside
his
head
rather
than
in
his
ear
what
the
devil
he
asked
himself
am
i
going
nuts
there
was
a
happy
little
laugh
inside
of
him
like
bubbles
rising
in
a
glass
of
champagne
oh
no
i
really
here
the
voice
inaudible
but
mentally
present
assured
him
you
ca
see
me
or
touch
me
or
even
really
hear
me
but
i
not
something
you
just
imagined
i
just
as
real
as
as
smokeball
there
only
i
a
different
kind
of
reality
watch
the
voice
stopped
and
something
that
had
seemed
to
be
close
to
him
left
him
immediately
the
kitten
stopped
playing
with
the
crumpled
paper
and
cocked
her
head
to
one
side
staring
fixedly
as
at
something
above
her
he
seen
cats
do
that
before
stare
and
entranced
as
though
at
something
wonderful
which
was
hidden
from
human
eyes
then
still
looking
up
and
to
the
side
smokeball
trotted
over
and
jumped
onto
his
lap
but
even
as
he
stroked
her
she
was
looking
at
an
invisible
something
beside
him
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
warm
and
pleasant
feeling
as
of
a
happy
and
affectionate
presence
near
him
no
he
said
slowly
and
judicially
that
not
just
my
imagination
but
who
or
what
are
you
i
oh
i
do
know
how
to
think
it
so
that
you
understand
the
voice
inside
his
head
seemed
baffled
like
a
physicist
trying
to
explain
atomic
energy
to
a
hottentot
i
not
material
if
you
can
imagine
a
mind
that
does
need
a
brain
to
think
with
oh
i
explain
it
now
but
when
i
talking
to
you
like
this
i
really
thinking
inside
your
brain
along
with
your
own
mind
and
you
hear
the
words
without
there
being
any
sound
and
you
just
do
know
any
words
that
would
express
it
he
had
never
thought
much
one
way
or
another
about
spiritualism
there
had
been
old
people
when
he
had
been
a
boy
who
had
told
stories
of
ghosts
and
apparitions
with
the
firmest
conviction
that
they
were
true
and
there
had
been
an
irishman
in
his
old
company
in
the
philippines
who
swore
that
the
ghost
of
a
dead
comrade
walked
post
with
him
when
he
was
on
guard
are
you
a
spirit
he
asked
i
mean
somebody
who
once
lived
in
a
body
like
me
the
voice
inside
him
seemed
doubtful
that
is
i
do
think
so
i
know
about
spirits
they
all
around
everywhere
but
i
think
i
one
at
least
i
always
been
like
i
am
now
as
long
as
i
can
remember
most
spirits
do
seem
to
sense
me
i
ca
reach
most
living
people
either
their
minds
are
closed
to
me
or
they
have
such
disgusting
minds
i
ca
bear
to
touch
them
children
are
open
to
me
but
when
they
tell
their
parents
about
me
they
are
laughed
at
or
punished
for
lying
and
then
they
close
up
against
me
you
the
first
person
i
been
able
to
reach
for
a
long
time
probably
getting
into
my
second
childhood
colonel
hampton
grunted
oh
but
you
must
be
ashamed
of
that
the
invisible
entity
told
him
that
the
beginning
of
real
wisdom
becoming
childlike
again
one
of
your
religious
teachers
said
something
like
that
long
ago
and
a
long
time
before
that
there
was
a
chinaman
whom
people
called
venerable
child
because
his
wisdom
had
turned
back
again
to
a
simplicity
that
was
lao
tze
colonel
hampton
said
a
little
surprised
tell
me
you
been
around
that
long
oh
but
i
have
longer
than
that
oh
for
very
long
and
yet
the
voice
he
seemed
to
be
hearing
was
the
voice
of
a
young
girl
you
do
mind
my
coming
to
talk
to
you
it
continued
i
get
so
lonely
so
dreadfully
lonely
you
see
urmh
so
do
i
colonel
hampton
admitted
i
probably
going
bats
but
what
the
hell
it
a
nice
way
to
go
bats
i
say
that
stick
around
whoever
you
are
and
let
get
acquainted
i
sort
of
like
you
a
feeling
of
warmth
suffused
him
as
though
he
had
been
hugged
by
someone
young
and
happy
and
loving
oh
i
glad
i
like
you
too
you
nice
yes
of
course
doctor
vehrner
nodded
sagely
that
is
a
schizoid
tendency
the
flight
from
reality
into
a
peopled
by
creatures
of
the
imagination
you
understand
there
is
usually
a
mixture
of
psychotic
conditions
in
cases
like
this
we
will
say
that
this
case
begins
with
simple
senile
dementia
physical
brain
degeneration
a
result
of
advanced
age
then
the
paranoid
symptoms
appear
he
imagines
himself
surrounded
by
envious
enemies
who
are
conspiring
against
him
the
patient
then
withdraws
into
himself
and
in
his
isolation
he
conjures
up
imaginary
companionship
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
beginning
he
had
suspected
that
this
unseen
visitor
was
no
more
than
a
figment
of
his
own
lonely
imagination
but
as
the
days
passed
this
suspicion
vanished
whatever
this
entity
might
be
an
entity
it
was
entirely
distinct
from
his
own
conscious
or
subconscious
mind
at
first
she
he
had
early
come
to
think
of
the
being
as
feminine
had
seemed
timid
fearful
lest
her
intrusions
into
his
mind
prove
a
nuisance
it
took
some
time
for
him
to
assure
her
that
she
was
always
welcome
with
time
too
his
impression
of
her
grew
stronger
and
more
concrete
he
found
that
he
was
able
to
visualize
her
as
he
might
visualize
something
remembered
or
conceived
of
in
imagination
a
lovely
young
girl
slender
and
clothed
in
something
loose
and
filmy
with
flowers
in
her
hair
and
clear
blue
eyes
a
pert
cheerful
face
a
wide
smiling
mouth
and
an
impudently
nose
he
realized
that
this
image
was
merely
a
sort
of
allegorical
representation
his
own
private
from
a
reality
which
his
senses
could
never
picture
as
it
existed
it
was
about
this
time
that
he
had
begun
to
call
her
dearest
she
had
given
him
no
name
and
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
that
one
i
been
thinking
she
said
i
ought
to
have
a
name
for
you
too
do
you
mind
if
i
call
you
popsy
huh
he
had
been
really
startled
at
that
if
he
needed
any
further
proof
of
dearest
independent
existence
that
was
it
never
in
the
uttermost
depths
of
his
subconscious
would
he
have
been
likely
to
label
himself
popsy
know
what
they
used
to
call
me
in
the
army
he
asked
slaughterhouse
hampton
they
claimed
i
needed
a
truckload
of
sawdust
to
follow
me
around
and
cover
up
the
blood
he
chuckled
nobody
but
you
would
think
of
calling
me
popsy
there
was
a
price
he
found
that
he
must
pay
for
companionship
the
price
of
eternal
vigilance
he
found
that
he
was
acquiring
the
habit
of
opening
doors
and
then
needlessly
standing
aside
to
allow
her
to
precede
him
and
although
she
insisted
that
he
need
not
speak
aloud
to
her
that
she
could
understand
any
thought
which
he
directed
to
her
he
could
not
help
actually
pronouncing
the
words
if
only
in
a
faint
whisper
he
was
glad
that
he
had
learned
before
the
end
of
his
plebe
year
at
west
point
to
speak
without
moving
his
lips
besides
himself
and
the
kitten
smokeball
there
was
one
other
at
greyrock
who
was
aware
if
only
faintly
of
dearest
presence
that
was
old
sergeant
williamson
the
colonel
negro
servant
a
retired
first
sergeant
from
the
regiment
he
had
last
commanded
with
increasing
frequency
he
would
notice
the
old
negro
pause
in
his
work
as
though
trying
to
identify
something
too
subtle
for
his
senses
and
then
shake
his
head
in
bewilderment
one
afternoon
in
early
october
just
about
a
year
ago
he
had
been
reclining
in
a
chair
on
the
west
veranda
smoking
a
cigar
and
trying
to
for
his
companion
a
mental
picture
of
an
indian
camp
as
he
had
seen
it
in
wyoming
in
the
middle
when
sergeant
williamson
came
out
from
the
house
carrying
a
pair
of
the
colonel
and
a
unaware
of
the
colonel
presence
he
set
down
his
burden
squatted
on
the
floor
and
began
polishing
the
boots
humming
softly
to
himself
then
he
must
have
caught
a
whiff
of
the
cigar
raising
his
head
he
saw
the
colonel
and
made
as
though
to
pick
up
the
boots
and
polishing
equipment
oh
that
all
right
sergeant
the
colonel
told
him
carry
on
with
what
you
doing
there
room
enough
for
both
of
us
here
yessuh
thank
yo
suh
the
old
resumed
his
soft
humming
keeping
time
with
the
brush
in
his
hand
you
know
popsy
i
think
he
knows
i
here
dearest
said
nothing
definite
of
course
he
just
feels
there
something
here
that
he
see
i
wonder
i
noticed
something
like
that
funny
he
does
seem
to
mind
either
colored
people
are
usually
scary
about
ghosts
and
spirits
and
the
like
i
going
to
ask
him
he
raised
his
voice
sergeant
do
you
seem
to
notice
anything
peculiar
around
here
lately
the
repetitious
little
melody
broke
off
short
the
lifted
his
face
and
looked
into
the
colonel
his
brow
wrinkled
as
though
he
were
trying
to
express
a
thought
for
which
he
had
no
words
yo
notice
dat
too
suh
he
asked
why
yessuh
cunnel
ah
don
know
how
t
say

but

dat
hit
seems
like
like
a
kinda

kinda
he
chuckled
dat
hit
cunnel
dey
a
blessedness
wondeh
iffen
ah
gittin
now
well
all
this
is
very
interesting
i
sure
doctor
barnwell
powell
was
saying
polishing
his
glasses
on
a
piece
of
tissue
and
keeping
one
elbow
on
his
briefcase
at
the
same
time
but
really
not
getting
us
anywhere
so
to
say
you
know
we
must
have
that
commitment
signed
by
you
now
is
it
or
is
it
not
your
opinion
that
this
man
is
of
unsound
mind
now
have
patience
powell
the
psychiatrist
soothed
him
you
must
admit
that
as
long
as
this
gentleman
refuses
to
talk
i
can
not
be
said
to
have
interviewed
him
what
if
he
wo
talk
stephen
hampton
burst
out
we
told
you
about
his
behavior
how
he
sits
for
hours
mumbling
to
this
imaginary
person
he
thinks
is
with
him
and
how
he
always
steps
aside
when
he
opens
a
door
to
let
somebody
who
is
there
go
through
ahead
of
him
and
how
oh
hell
what
the
use
if
he
were
in
his
right
mind
speak
up
and
try
to
prove
it
would
he
what
do
you
say
myra
myra
was
silent
and
colonel
hampton
found
himself
watching
her
with
interest
her
mouth
had
twisted
into
a
wry
grimace
and
she
was
clutching
the
arms
of
her
chair
until
her
knuckles
whitened
she
seemed
to
be
in
some
intense
pain
colonel
hampton
hoped
she
were
preferably
with
something
slightly
fatal
sergeant
williamson
suspicion
that
he
might
be
getting
religion
became
a
reality
for
a
time
that
winter
after
the
miracle
it
had
been
a
blustery
day
in
with
a
high
wind
driving
swirls
of
snow
across
the
fields
and
colonel
hampton
fretting
indoors
for
several
days
decided
to
go
out
and
fill
his
lungs
with
fresh
air
bundled
warmly
swinging
his
blackthorn
cane
he
had
set
out
accompanied
by
dearest
to
tramp
to
the
village
three
miles
from
greyrock
they
had
enjoyed
the
walk
through
the
white
desolation
the
old
man
and
his
invisible
companion
until
the
accident
had
happened
a
sheet
of
glassy
ice
had
lain
treacherously
hidden
under
a
skift
of
snow
when
he
stepped
upon
it
his
feet
shot
from
under
him
the
stick
flew
from
his
hand
and
he
went
down
when
he
tried
to
rise
he
found
that
he
could
not
dearest
had
been
almost
frantic
oh
popsy
you
must
get
up
she
cried
you
freeze
if
you
do
come
on
popsy
try
again
he
tried
in
vain
his
old
body
would
not
obey
his
will
it
no
use
dearest
i
ca
maybe
it
just
as
well
he
said
freezing
an
easy
death
and
you
say
people
live
on
as
spirits
after
they
die
maybe
we
can
always
be
together
now
i
do
know
i
do
want
you
to
die
yet
popsy
i
never
was
able
to
get
through
to
a
spirit
and
i
afraid
wait
can
you
crawl
a
little
enough
to
get
over
under
those
young
pines
i
think
so
his
left
leg
was
numb
and
he
believed
that
it
was
broken
i
can
try
he
managed
to
roll
onto
his
back
with
his
head
toward
the
clump
of
pine
seedlings
using
both
hands
and
his
right
heel
he
was
able
to
propel
himself
slowly
through
the
snow
until
he
was
out
of
the
worst
of
the
wind
that
good
now
try
to
cover
yourself
dearest
advised
put
your
hands
in
your
coat
pockets
and
wait
here
i
try
to
get
help
then
she
left
him
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
he
lay
motionless
in
the
scant
protection
of
the
young
pines
suffering
miserably
he
began
to
grow
drowsy
as
soon
as
he
realized
what
was
happening
he
was
frightened
and
the
fright
pulled
him
awake
again
soon
he
felt
himself
drowsing
again
by
shifting
his
position
he
caused
a
jab
of
pain
from
his
broken
leg
which
brought
him
back
to
wakefulness
then
the
deadly
drowsiness
returned
this
time
he
was
wakened
by
a
sharp
voice
mingled
with
a
throbbing
sound
that
seemed
part
of
a
dream
of
the
cannonading
in
the
argonne
dah
dah
it
was
he
realized
sergeant
williamson
voice
gittin
soft
in
de
haid
is
ah
yo
ol
wuthless
he
turned
his
face
to
see
the
battered
jeep
from
greyrock
driven
by
arthur
the
stableman
and
gardener
with
sergeant
williamson
beside
him
the
older
negro
jumped
to
the
ground
and
ran
toward
him
at
the
same
time
he
felt
dearest
with
him
again
we
made
it
popsy
we
made
it
she
was
exulting
i
was
afraid
never
make
him
understand
but
i
did
and
you
should
have
seen
him
bully
that
other
man
into
driving
the
jeep
are
you
all
right
popsy
is
yo
all
right
cunnel
sergeant
williamson
was
asking
my
leg
broken
i
think
but
outside
of
that
i
all
right
he
answered
both
of
them
how
did
you
happen
to
find
me
sergeant
the
old
negro
soldier
rolled
his
eyes
upward
cunnel
hit
war
a
of
de
blessed
lawd
he
replied
solemnly
an
angel
of
de
lawd
done
appeahed
unto
me
he
shook
his
head
slowly
ah
a
sinful
man
cunnel
ah
could
see
de
angel
face
to
face
but
de
glory
of
de
angel
was
befoh
me
an
guided
me
they
used
his
cane
and
a
bough
to
splint
the
leg
they
wrapped
him
in
a
and
hauled
him
back
to
greyrock
and
put
him
to
bed
with
dearest
clinging
solicitously
to
him
the
fractured
leg
knit
slowly
though
the
physician
was
amazed
at
the
speed
with
which
considering
his
age
he
made
recovery
and
with
his
unfailing
cheerfulness
he
did
not
know
of
course
that
he
was
being
assisted
by
an
invisible
nurse
for
all
that
however
the
leaves
on
the
oaks
around
greyrock
were
green
again
before
colonel
hampton
could
leave
his
bed
and
hobble
about
the
house
on
a
cane
arthur
the
young
negro
who
had
driven
the
jeep
had
become
one
of
the
most
solid
pillars
of
the
little
church
beyond
the
village
as
a
result
sergeant
williamson
had
also
become
an
attendant
at
church
for
a
while
and
then
stopped
without
being
able
to
define
or
spell
or
even
pronounce
the
term
sergeant
williamson
was
a
strict
pragmatist
most
africans
are
even
five
generations
removed
from
the
that
brought
their
forefathers
from
the
dark
continent
and
sergeant
williamson
could
not
find
the
blessedness
at
the
church
instead
it
seemed
to
center
about
the
room
where
his
employer
and
former
regiment
commander
lay
that
to
his
mind
was
quite
reasonable
if
an
angel
of
the
lord
was
going
to
tarry
upon
earth
the
celestial
being
would
naturally
prefer
the
society
of
a
retired
colonel
to
that
of
a
passel
of
triflin
at
an
ol
clapboard
church
house
be
that
as
it
may
he
could
always
find
the
blessedness
in
colonel
room
and
sometimes
when
the
colonel
would
be
asleep
the
blessedness
would
follow
him
out
and
linger
with
him
for
a
while
colonel
hampton
wondered
anxiously
where
dearest
was
now
he
had
not
felt
her
presence
since
his
nephew
had
brought
his
lawyer
and
the
psychiatrist
into
the
house
he
wondered
if
she
had
voluntarily
separated
herself
from
him
for
fear
he
might
give
her
some
sign
of
recognition
that
these
harpies
would
fasten
upon
as
an
evidence
of
unsound
mind
he
could
not
believe
that
she
had
deserted
him
entirely
now
when
he
needed
her
most
well
what
can
i
do
doctor
vehrner
was
complaining
you
bring
me
here
to
interview
him
and
he
just
sits
there
and
does
nothing
will
you
consent
to
my
giving
him
an
injection
of
sodium
pentathol
well
i
do
know
now
barnwell
powell
objected
i
heard
of
that
drug
one
of
the
drugs
i
doubt
if
testimony
taken
under
its
influence
would
be
admissible
in
a
court
this
is
not
a
court
powell
the
doctor
explained
patiently
and
i
am
not
taking
testimony
i
am
making
a
diagnosis
pentathol
is
a
recognized
diagnostic
agent
go
ahead
stephen
hampton
said
anything
to
get
this
over
with
you
agree
myra
myra
said
nothing
she
simply
sat
with
staring
eyes
and
clutched
the
arms
of
her
chair
as
though
to
keep
from
slipping
into
some
dreadful
abyss
once
a
low
moan
escaped
from
her
lips
my
wife
is
naturally
overwrought
by
this
painful
business
stephen
said
i
trust
that
you
gentlemen
will
excuse
her
had
you
better
go
and
lie
down
somewhere
myra
she
shook
her
head
violently
moaning
again
both
the
doctor
and
the
attorney
were
looking
at
her
curiously
well
i
object
to
being
drugged
colonel
hampton
said
rising
and
what
more
i
wo
submit
to
it
albert
doctor
vehrner
said
sharply
nodding
toward
the
colonel
the
pithecanthropoid
attendant
in
the
white
jacket
hastened
forward
pinned
his
arms
behind
him
and
dragged
him
down
into
the
chair
for
an
instant
the
old
man
tried
to
resist
then
realizing
the
futility
and
undignity
of
struggling
subsided
the
psychiatrist
had
taken
a
leather
case
from
his
pocket
and
was
selecting
a
hypodermic
needle
then
myra
hampton
leaped
to
her
feet
her
face
working
hideously
no
stop
stop
she
cried
everybody
looked
at
her
in
surprise
colonel
hampton
no
less
than
the
others
stephen
hampton
called
out
her
name
sharply
no
you
sha
do
this
to
me
you
sha
you
torturing
me
you
are
all
devils
she
screamed
devils
myra
her
husband
barked
stepping
forward
with
a
twist
she
eluded
him
dashing
around
the
desk
and
pulling
open
a
drawer
for
an
instant
she
fumbled
inside
it
and
when
she
brought
her
hand
up
she
had
colonel
hampton
automatic
in
it
she
drew
back
the
slide
and
released
it
loading
the
chamber
doctor
vehrner
the
hypodermic
in
his
hand
turned
stephen
hampton
sprang
at
her
dropping
his
drink
and
albert
the
prognathous
attendant
released
colonel
hampton
and
leaped
at
the
woman
with
the
pistol
with
the
unthinking
promptness
of
a
dog
whose
master
is
in
danger
stephen
hampton
was
the
closest
to
her
she
shot
him
first
in
the
chest
the
heavy
bullet
knocked
him
backward
against
a
small
table
he
and
it
fell
over
together
while
he
was
falling
the
woman
turned
dipped
the
muzzle
of
her
pistol
slightly
and
fired
again
doctor
vehrner
leg
gave
way
under
him
and
he
went
down
the
hypodermic
flying
from
his
hand
and
landing
at
colonel
hampton
feet
at
the
same
time
the
attendant
albert
was
almost
upon
her
quickly
she
reversed
the
heavy
colt
pressed
the
muzzle
against
her
heart
and
fired
a
third
shot
barnwell
powell
had
let
the
briefcase
slip
to
the
floor
he
was
staring
at
the
tableau
of
violence
which
had
been
enacted
before
him
the
attendant
having
reached
myra
was
looking
down
at
her
stupidly
then
he
stooped
and
straightened
she
dead
he
said
unbelievingly
colonel
hampton
rose
putting
his
heel
on
the
hypodermic
and
crushing
it
of
course
she
dead
he
barked

any
training

other
people

vehrner
first
the
other
man
unconscious

moderated

voice
and
manner
about

a
degree
and

williamson
said
entering
the
room

a
move
on
he
stood
just
inside
the
doorway
holding
a
malacca
that
he
had
taken
from
the
he
was
grasping
it
in
his
left
hand
below
the
band
with
the
crook
out
holding
it
at
his
side
as
though
it
were
a
sword
in
a
scabbard
which
was
exactly
what
that
was
albert
looked
at
him
and
then
back
at
colonel
hampton
then
whipping
off
his
necktie
he
went
down
on
his
knees
beside
doctor
vehrner
skillfully
applying
the
improvised
tourniquet
twisting
it
tight
with
an
ruler
the
colonel
took
from
the
desk
and
handed
to
him

colonel
said
and

sergeant
williamson
executed
an
automatic
salute
and
and
raced
from
the
room
the
colonel
picked
up
the
telephone
on
the
desk
the
county
hospital
was
three
miles
from
greyrock
the
state
police
substation
a
good

the
state
police

old
negro
cavalryman
the
room
without
the
and
carrying
a
heavy
leather
box
on
a
strap
over
his
shoulder
he
set
this
on
the
floor
and
opened
it
then
knelt
beside
stephen
hampton
the
colonel
was
calling
the
hospital
gunshot
wounds
he
was
saying
one
man
in
the
chest
and
the
other
in
the
leg

pistol

colonel
hampton
nodded
well

ambulance

here
and
there
whiskey
and
glasses
on
that
table
over
there
better
give
doctor
vehrner
a
drink
he
looked
at
barnwell
powell
still
frozen
to
his
chair
aghast
at
the
carnage
around
him
and
give
powell
a
drink
too
he
needs
one
he
did
indeed
colonel
hampton
could
have
used
a
drink
too
the
library
looked
like
at
an
indian
agency
but
he
was
still
slaughterhouse
hampton
and
consequently
could
not
afford
to
exhibit
queasiness
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
since
the
business
had
started
that
he
felt
the
presence
of
dearest
oh
popsy
are
you
all
right
the
voice
inside
his
head
was
asking
it
all
over
now
you
wo
have
anything
to
worry
about
any
more
but
oh
i
was
afraid
i
would
be
able
to
do
it
my
god
dearest
he
almost
spoke
aloud
did
you
make
her
do
that
popsy
the
voice
in
his
mind
was
you
afraid
of
me
never
be
afraid
of
dearest
popsy
and
do
hate
me
for
this
it
was
the
only
thing
i
could
do
if
he
given
you
that
injection
he
could
have
made
you
tell
him
all
about
us
and
then
have
been
sure
you
were
crazy
and
they
have
taken
you
away
and
they
treat
people
dreadfully
at
that
place
of
his
you
have
been
driven
really
crazy
before
long
and
then
your
mind
would
have
been
closed
to
me
so
that
i
would
have
been
able
to
get
through
to
you
any
more
what
i
did
was
the
only
thing
i
could
do
i
do
hate
you
dearest
he
replied
mentally
and
i
do
blame
you
it
was
a
little
disconcerting
though
to
discover
the
extent
of
your
capabilities
how
did
you
manage
it
you
remember
how
i
made
the
sergeant
see
an
angel
the
time
you
were
down
in
the
snow
colonel
hampton
nodded
well
i
made
her
see
things
that
were
angels
dearest
continued
after
i
driven
her
almost
to
distraction
i
was
able
to
get
into
her
mind
and
take
control
of
her
colonel
hampton
felt
a
shudder
inside
of
him
that
was
horrible
that
woman
had
a
mind
like
a
sewer
i
still
feel
dirty
from
it
but
i
made
her
get
the
pistol
i
knew
where
you
kept
it
and
i
knew
how
to
use
it
even
if
she
did
remember
when
we
were
shooting
muskrats
that
time
along
the
river
uhuh
i
wondered
how
she
knew
enough
to
unlock
the
action
and
load
the
chamber
he
turned
and
faced
the
others
doctor
vehrner
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
the
chair
colonel
hampton
had
occupied
his
injured
leg
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
albert
was
hovering
over
him
with
solicitude
barnwell
powell
was
finishing
his
whiskey
and
recovering
a
fraction
of
his
normal
poise
well
i
suppose
you
gentlemen
see
now
who
was
really
crazy
around
here
colonel
hampton
addressed
them
bitingly
that
woman
has
been
dangerously
close
to
the
borderline
of
sanity
for
as
long
as
she
been
here
i
think
my
precious
nephew
trumped
up
this
ridiculous
insanity
complaint
against
me
as
much
to
discredit
any
testimony
i
might
ever
give
about
his
wife
mental
condition
as
because
he
wanted
to
get
control
of
my
estate
i
also
suppose
that
the
tension
she
was
under
here
this
afternoon
was
too
much
for
her
and
the
scheme
boomeranged
on
its
originators
curious
case
of
poetic
justice
but
i
sorry
you
had
to
be
included
in
it
doctor
attaboy
popsy
dearest
enthused
now
you
have
them
on
the
run
give
them
a
chance
to
you
know
what
patton
always
said
grab
by
the
nose
and
kick
in
the
pants
colonel
hampton
his
cigar
patton
only
said
when
he
was
talking
for
publication
he
told
her
then
he
noticed
the
unsigned
commitment
paper
lying
on
the
desk
he
picked
it
up
crumpled
it
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
i
do
think
you
be
needing
that
he
said
you
know
this
the
first
time
my
loving
nephew
has
expressed
doubts
as
to
my
sanity
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
at
the
desk
motioning
to
his
servant
to
bring
him
a
drink
and
see
to
the
other
gentlemen
glasses
sergeant
he
directed
back
in
stephen
thought
i
was
crazy
as
a
bedbug
to
sell
all
my
securities
and
take
a
paper
loss
around
the
first
of
september
after
october
i
bought
them
back
at
about
twenty
per
cent
of
what
i
sold
them
for
after
he
lost
his
shirt
that
he
knew
would
have
an
effect
on
barnwell
powell
and
in
december
i
was
just
plain
nuts
selling
all
my
munition
shares
and
investing
in
a
company
that
manufactured
stephen
thought
that
rundstedt
ardennes
would
put
off
the
end
of
the
war
for
another
year
and
a
half
eh
doctor
vehrner
chuckled
colonel
hampton
sipped
his
whiskey
slowly
then
puffed
on
his
cigar
no
this
pair
were
competent
liars
he
replied
a
good
workmanlike
liar
never
makes
up
a
story
out
of
the
whole
cloth
he
always
takes
a
fabric
of
truth
and
embroiders
it
to
suit
the
situation
he
smiled
grimly
that
was
an
accurate
description
of
his
own
tactical
procedure
at
the
moment
i
had
intended
this
to
come
out
doctor
but
it
happens
that
i
am
a
convinced
believer
in
spiritualism
i
suppose
think
that
a
delusional
belief
too
well
doctor
vehrner
pursed
his
lips
i
reject
the
idea
of
survival
after
death
myself
but
i
think
that
people
who
believe
in
such
a
theory
are
merely
misevaluating
evidence
it
is
definitely
not
in
itself
a
symptom
of
a
psychotic
condition
thank
you
doctor
the
colonel
gestured
with
his
cigar
now
admit
their
statements
about
my
appearing
to
be
in
conversation
with
some
invisible
or
imaginary
being
that
all
quite
true
i
convinced
that
i
in
communication
with
the
spirit
of
a
young
girl
who
was
killed
by
indians
in
this
section
about
a
hundred
and
years
ago
at
first
she
communicated
by
automatic
writing
later
we
established
communication
well
naturally
a
man
in
my
position
would
dislike
the
label
of
there
are
too
many
invidious
associations
connected
with
the
term
but
there
it
is
i
trust
both
of
you
gentlemen
will
remember
the
ethics
of
your
respective
professions
and
keep
this
confidential
oh
brother
dearest
was
fairly
hugging
him
with
delight
when
bigger
and
better
lies
are
told
we
tell
them
do
we
popsy
yes
and
try
and
prove
otherwise
colonel
hampton
replied
around
his
cigar
then
he
blew
a
jet
of
smoke
and
spoke
to
the
men
in
front
of
him
i
intend
paying
for
my
nephew
hospitalization
and
for
his
funeral
he
said
and
then
i
going
to
pack
up
all
his
personal
belongings
and
all
of
hers
when
he
discharged
from
the
hospital
i
ship
them
wherever
he
wants
them
but
he
wo
be
allowed
to
come
back
here
after
this
business
i
through
with
him
barnwell
powell
nodded
primly
i
do
blame
you
in
the
least
colonel
he
said
i
think
you
have
been
abominably
treated
and
your
attitude
is
most
generous
he
was
about
to
say
something
else
when
the
doorbell
tinkled
and
sergeant
williamson
went
out
into
the
hall
oh
dear
i
suppose
that
the
police
now
the
lawyer
said
he
grimaced
like
a
small
boy
in
a
dentist
chair
colonel
hampton
felt
dearest
leave
him
for
a
moment
then
she
was
back
the
ambulance
then
he
caught
a
sparkle
of
mischief
in
her
mood
let
have
some
fun
popsy
the
doctor
is
a
young
man
with
brown
hair
and
a
mustache
glasses
a
blue
tie
and
a
bag
one
of
the
ambulance
men
has
red
hair
and
the
other
has
a
on
his
left
sleeve
tell
them
your
told
you
the
old
soldier
mustache
twitched
with
amusement
no
gentlemen
it
is
the
ambulance
he
corrected
my
says
he
relayed
dearest
descriptions
to
them
barnwell
powell
blinked
a
speculative
look
came
into
the
psychiatrist
eyes
he
was
probably
wishing
the
commitment
paper
been
destroyed
then
the
doctor
came
bustling
in
spectacled
carrying
a
tan
bag
and
behind
him
followed
the
two
ambulance
men
one
with
a
thatch
of
flaming
red
hair
and
the
other
with
a
stain
of
mercurochrome
on
his
for
an
instant
the
lawyer
and
the
psychiatrist
gaped
at
them
then
barnwell
powell
put
one
hand
to
his
mouth
and
made
a
small
gibbering
sound
and
doctor
vehrner
gave
a
faint
squawk
and
then
both
men
grabbed
simultaneously
for
the
whiskey
bottle
the
laughter
of
dearest
tinkled
inaudibly
through
the
rumbling
mirth
of
colonel
hampton
the
end
typographical
errors
corrected
in
the
text
a
man
in
my
position
would
dislike
the
label
of
the
word
meduim
was
corrected
to
medium
