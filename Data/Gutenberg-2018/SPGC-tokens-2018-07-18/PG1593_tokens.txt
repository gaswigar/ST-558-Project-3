burr
bird
the
bird
and
the
burdock
who
there
who
has
never
heard
about
the
burdock
and
the
bird
and
yet
how
few
discriminate
between
the
two
while
even
burbank
transform
a
bird
into
a
plant
illustration
burbank
the
clover
the
plover
illustration
the
clover
the
plover
the
plover
and
the
clover
can
be
told
apart
with
ease
by
paying
close
attention
to
the
habits
of
the
bees
for
aver
the
bee
can
be
in
clover
while
concur
there
is
no
b
in
plover
the
crow
the
crocus
illustration
the
crow
the
crocus
some
are
unable
as
you
know
to
tell
the
crocus
from
the
crow
the
reason
why
is
just
because
they
are
not
versed
in
nature
laws
the
noisy
cawing
crows
all
come
obedient
to
the
a
large
crow
to
convoke
you
hear
the
crocus
croak
the
rue
the
rooster
illustration
the
rue
the
rooster
of
rooster
the
rudiment
clearly
is
and
the
bird
from
the
plant
very
probably
grew
you
can
easily
tell
them
apart
without
fail
by
merely
observing
the
rue
lacks
the
parrot
the
carrot
illustration
the
parrot
the
carrot
the
parrot
and
the
carrot
we
may
easily
confound
they
very
much
alike
in
looks
and
similar
in
sound
we
recognize
the
parrot
by
his
clear
articulation
for
carrots
are
unable
to
engage
in
conversation
the
pea
the
pewee
illustration
the
pea
the
pewee
to
tell
the
pewee
from
the
pea
requires
great
here
in
the
pod
we
see
the
pea
while
perched
close
by
is
the
pewee
the
pea
he
hears
the
pewee
peep
while
pewee
sees
the
wee
pea
weep
there
be
but
little
time
to
see
how
pewee
differs
from
the
pea
the
pelican
the
panicle
illustration
the
pelican
the
panicle
the
panicle
and
pelican
have
often
been
confused
the
letters
which
spell
pelican
in
panicle
are
used
you
never
need
confound
the
two
there
are
many
ways
of
telling
the
simplest
thing
that
one
can
do
is
to
observe
the
spelling
the
hen
the
lichen
illustration
the
hen
the
lichen
the
lichens
lie
on
rocks
and
bark
they
look
somewhat
like
hens
hens
they
we
may
remark
a
difference
of
tense
the
hawk
the
hollyhock
illustration
the
hawk
the
hollyhock
to
recognize
this
the
broody
hen
you
should
survey
she
takes
her
chicks
on
daily
walks
among
the
neighboring
hollyhocks
while
with
the
hawk
association
is
quite
beyond
her
toleration
the
cow
bird
the
cowslip
illustration
the
cow
bird
the
cowslip
growing
in
mires
in
gold
attired
the
cowslip
has
been
much
admired
altho
its
proper
name
we
told
is
really
the
marsh
marigold
the
cow
bird
picture
i
suspect
is
absolutely
incorrect
we
make
such
errors
now
and
then
a
sort
of
cow
slip
of
the
pen
a
sparrer
asparagus
illustration
a
sparrer
asparagus
the
sparrow
from
flying
is
quite
out
of
breath
in
fact
he
has
worked
himself
almost
to
death
while
the
lazy
asparagus
so
it
is
said
spends
all
of
his
time
in
the
bed
the
tern
the
turnip
illustration
the
tern
the
turnip
to
tell
the
turnip
from
the
tern
a
thing
which
everyone
should
learn
observe
the
tern
up
in
the
air
see
how
he
turns
and
now
compare
him
with
this
inert
vegetable
who
thus
to
turn
is
quite
unable
for
he
is
rooted
to
the
spot
while
as
we
see
the
tern
is
not
he
is
not
always
doomed
to
be
thus
bound
to
earth
for
cooked
to
a
turn
may
be
inferred
to
change
the
turnip
to
the
bird
illustration
observe
the
turnip
in
the
pot
the
tern
is
glad
that
he
is
not
the
ole
gander
the
oleander
illustration
the
ole
gander
the
oleander
the
gander
loves
to
promenade
around
the
farmer
while
as
we
see
the
oleander
is
quite
unable
to
meander
the
blue
mountain
lory
the
blue
morning
glory
illustration
the
blue
mountain
lory
the
blue
morning
glory
the
blue
mountain
lory
spends
most
of
his
time
in
climbing
about
in
a
tropical
clime
we
therefore
our
efforts
need
only
confine
to
minutely
observing
the
climb
of
the
vine
the
quail
the
kale
illustration
the
quail
the
kale
the
california
quail
is
said
to
have
a
tail
upon
his
head
while
we
style
the
kale
a
cabbage
head
upon
a
tail
it
is
not
hard
to
tell
the
two
the
quail
commences
with
a
queue
the
pecan
the
toucan
illustration
the
pecan
the
toucan
very
few
can
tell
the
toucan
from
the
pecan
here
a
new
plan
to
take
the
toucan
from
the
tree
requires
while
can
pick
with
ease
the
pecans
from
the
pecan
trees
it
such
an
easy
thing
to
do
that
even
the
toucan
he
can
too
the
auk
the
orchid
illustration
the
auk
the
orchid
we
seldom
meet
when
out
to
walk
either
the
orchid
or
the
auk
the
auk
indeed
is
only
known
to
dwellers
in
the
auktic
zone
while
orchids
can
be
found
in
legions
within
the
equatorial
regions
the
graceful
orchid
on
its
stalk
resembles
so
the
auk
is
plain
we
must
some
means
discover
to
tell
the
two
from
one
another
the
obvious
difference
to
be
sure
is
merely
one
of
temperature
illustration
for
eskimos
perhaps
the
auk
performs
the
duties
of
the
stork
the
the
illustration
the
the
the
call
resembles
that
emitted
by
the
pussy
cat
while
growing
by
the
wall
is
never
known
to
caterwaul
its
odor
though
attracts
the
kits
and
throws
them
in
catniption
fits
illustration
the
ibis
the
illustration
the
ibis
the
the
sacred
ibis
tells
his
beads
and
gravely
from
his
reads
the
ibis
therfore
we
may
say
is
classified
a
we
have
heard
related
the
is
designated
their
difference
is
plain
indeed
the
flower
is
red
the
bird
can
read
the
the
illustration
the
the
the
little
can
sing
from
morn
night
like
anything
the
quacking
of
the
can
not
be
called
a
song
at
all
we
thus
the
flower
may
learn
to
know
its
song
is
reproduced
below
illustration
the
bay
the
jay
illustration
the
bay
the
jay
the
as
we
plainly
see
resembles
much
the
green
bay
tree
the
difference
between
the
two
is
one
of
hue
though
this
is
not
the
only
way
to
tell
the
from
the
bay
the
pipe
the
snipe
illustration
the
pipe
the
snipe
observe
the
common
indian
pipe
likewise
the
english
snipe
who
is
distinguished
as
we
see
by
his
superior
pedigree

the
roc
the
shamrock
illustration
the
roc
the
shamrock
observe
how
peacefully
the
cows
among
the
little
shamrocks
browse
in
contrast
with
their
actions
frantic
when
they
perceive
the
roc
gigantic
we
need
but
watch
and
seek
no
other
explanation
the
lark
the
larkspur
illustration
the
lark
the
larkspur
the
larkspur
likeness
to
the
lark
is
surely
worthy
of
remark
although
to
see
it
we
require
the
aid
of
a
small
magnifier
which
circumstance
of
course
implies
their
difference
is
one
of
size
puffin

nuffin
upon
this
cake
of
ice
is
perched
the
puffin
to
find
his

have
searched

apology
not
every
one
is
always
able
to
recognize
a
vegetable
for
some
are
guided
by
tradition
while
others
use
their
intuition
and
even
i
make
no
pretense
of
having
more
than
common
sense
indeed
these
strange
homologies
are
in
most
flornithologies
and
i
have
freely
drawn
upon
the
works
of
gray
and
audubon
avoiding

blunders

those
