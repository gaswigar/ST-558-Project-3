introduction

year
was
a
great
year
of
discovery
amazing
stories
were
uncovering
new

at
such
a
great
rate
harl

francis
nowlan
fletcher
pratt
and
miles
breuer
that
jack
williamson
barely
managed
to
become
one
of
a
distinguished
group
of
discoveries
by
stealing
the
cover
of
the
december
issue
for
his
first
the
metal
man
disciple
of
merritt
he
attempted
to
imitate
in
style
mood
and
subject
the
magic
of
that
late
lamented
master
of
fantasy
the
imitation
found
great
favor
from
the
readership
and
almost
instantly
jack
williamson
became
an
important
name
on
the
contents
page
amazing
stories
followed
his
initial
success
with
two
short
the

amazing

the

gernsback
publication
both
of
these
stories
were
close
copies
of
merritt
whose
style
and
method
jack
williamson
parlayed
into
popularity
for
eight
the
strange
thing
about
it
was
that
jack
williamson
was
one
of
the
most
versatile
science
fiction
authors
ever
to
sit
down
at
the
typewriter
when
the
vogue
for
altered
to
super
science
he
created
the
memorable
super
giles
habilula
as
the
major
attraction
in
a
rousing
trio
of
space
the
legion
of
space
the
cometeers
one
against
the
legion
grim
realism
was
the
order
of
the
day
he
crucible
of
power
when
they
wanted
extrapolated
theory
in
present
tense
he
assumed
the
disguise
of
will
stewart
and
popularized
the
concept
of
contra
terrene
matter
in
science
fiction
seetee
ship
seetee
shock
when
only
psychological
studies
of
the
future
would
do
he
with
folded
hands
and
searching
mind
the
cosmic
express
of
special
interest
because
it
was
written
during
williamson
merritt
kick
when
he
was
writing
little
else
but
and
it
gave
the
earliest
indication
of
a
more
general
capability
the
lightness
of
the
handling
is
especially
modern
barely
avoiding
the
farcical
by
the
validity
of
the
notion
that
wireless
transmission
of
matter
is
the
next
big
transportation
frontier
to
be
conquered
it
is
especially
important
because
it
stylistically
forecast
a
later
trend
to
accept
the
background
for
granted
regardless
of
the
quantity
of
wonders
and
proceed
with
the
story
with
only
a
few
thousand
television
sets
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
writing
the
surmise
that
this
media
would
be
a
natural
for
westerns
was
particularly
williamson
was
born
in
in
the
arizona
territory
when
covered
wagons
were
the
primary
form
of
transportation
and
apaches
still
raided
the
settlers
his
father
was
a
cattle
man
but
for
young
jack
the
ranch
was
anything
but
glamorous
my
days
were
filled
he
remembers
with
monotonous
rounds
of
what
seemed
an
endless
war
with
drought
and
frost
and
and
hail
for
the
sake
of
survival
on
llano
estacado
discovery
amazing
stories
the
escape
he
sought
and
his
goal
was
to
be
a
science
fiction
writer
he
labored
to
this
end
and
the
first
he
knew
that
a
story
of
his
had
been
accepted
was
when
he
bought
the
december
issue
amazing
stories
then
he
has
written
millions
of
words
of
science
fiction
and
has
gone
on
record
as
follows
i
feel
that
is
the
folklore
of
the
new
world
of
science
and
the
expression
of
man
reaction
to
a
technological
environment
by
which
i
mean
that
it
is
the
most
interesting
and
stimulating
form
of
literature
today
eric
tumbled
out
of
the
rumpled
a
striking
slender
figure
in
pajamas
he
smiled
fondly
across
to
the
other
of
the
twin
beds
where
nada
his
pretty
bride
lay
quiet
beneath
light
silk
covers
with
a
groan
he
stood
up
and
began
a
series
of
fantastic
bending
exercises
but
after
a
few
movements
he
gave
it
up
and
walked
through
an
open
door
into
a
small
bright
room
its
walls
covered
with
bookcases
and
also
with
scientific
appliances
that
would
have
been
strange
to
the
man
of
four
or
five
centuries
before
when
the
age
of
aviation
was
beginning
yawning
eric
stood
before
the
great
open
window
staring
out
below
him
was
a
wide
space
green
with
emerald
lawns
and
bright
with
flowering
plants
two
hundred
yards
across
it
rose
an
immense
pyramidal
building
an
artistic
structure
gleaming
with
white
marble
and
bright
metal
striped
with
the
verdure
of
terraced
its
slender
peak
rising
to
help
support
the
gray
glass
roof
above
beyond
the
park
stretched
away
in
illimitable
vistas
broken
with
the
graceful
columned
buildings
that
held
up
the
great
glass
roof
illustration
suddenly
there
was
a
sharp
tingling
sensation
where
they
touched
the
polished
surface
above
the
glass
over
this
new
york
of
a
freezing
blizzard
was
sweeping
but
small
concern
was
that
to
the
lightly
clad
man
at
the
window
who
was
inhaling
deeply
the
fragrant
air
from
the
plants
below
air
kept
winter
and
summer
exactly
at
with
another
yawn
eric
turned
back
to
the
room
which
was
bright
with
the
rich
golden
light
that
poured
in
from
the
suspended
globes
of
the
cold
that
illuminated
the
city
with
a
distasteful
grimace
he
seated
himself
before
a
broad
desk
sat
a
few
minutes
leaning
back
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
at
last
he
straightened
reluctantly
slid
a
small
typewriter
out
of
its
drawer
and
began
pecking
at
it
impatiently
for
eric
was
an
author
there
was
a
whole
shelf
of
his
books
on
the
wall
in
bright
jackets
red
and
blue
and
green
that
brought
a
thrill
of
pleasure
to
the
young
novelist
heart
when
he
looked
up
from
his
clattering
machine
he
wrote
thrilling
action
romances
as
his
enthusiastic
publishers
and
television
directors
said
of
ages
past
when
men
were
men
heroes
responding
vigorously
to
the
stirring
passions
of
primordial
life
he
was
impartial
as
to
the
source
of
his
thrills
provided
they
were
distant
enough
from
modern
civilization
his
hero
was
likely
to
be
an
roaring
through
the
jungle
with
a
bloody
rock
in
one
hand
and
a
beautiful
girl
in
the
other
or
a
cowboy
the
vanishing
hero
of
the
ancient
ranches
or
a
man
marooned
with
a
lovely
woman
on
a
desert
south
sea
island
his
heroes
were
invariably
strong
fearless
resourceful
fellows
who
could
handle
a
club
on
equal
terms
with
a
or
call
science
to
aid
them
in
defending
a
beautiful
mate
from
the
terrors
of
a
desolate
wilderness
and
a
hundred
million
read
eric
novels
and
watched
the
dramatization
of
them
on
the
television
screens
they
thrilled
at
the
simple
romantic
lives
his
heroes
led
paid
him
handsome
royalties
and
subconsciously
shared
his
opinion
that
civilization
had
taken
all
the
best
from
the
life
of
man
eric
had
settled
down
to
the
artistic
satisfaction
of
describing
the
sensuous
delight
of
his
hero
in
the
roasted
of
a
dead
mammoth
when
the
pretty
woman
in
the
other
room
stirred
and
presently
came
tripping
into
the
study
gay
and
vivacious
and
as
her
husband
of
a
few
months
most
justly
thought
altogether
beautiful
in
a
bright
silk
dressing
gown
recklessly
he
slammed
the
machine
back
into
its
place
and
resolved
to
forget
that
his
next
action
thriller
was
due
in
the
publisher
office
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
sprang
up
to
kiss
his
wife
held
her
embraced
for
a
long
happy
moment
and
then
they
went
hand
in
hand
to
the
side
of
the
room
and
punched
a
series
of
buttons
on
a
panel
a
simple
way
of
ordering
breakfast
sent
up
the
automatic
shaft
from
the
kitchens
below
nada
was
also
an
author
she
wrote
poems
back
to
nature
stuff
simple
lyrics
of
the
sea
of
sunsets
of
bird
songs
of
bright
flowers
and
warm
winds
of
thrilling
communion
with
nature
and
growing
things
men
read
her
poems
and
called
her
a
genius
even
though
the
whole
world
had
grown
up
into
a
city
the
birds
were
extinct
there
were
no
wild
flowers
and
no
one
had
time
to
bother
about
sunsets
eric
darling
she
said
is
it
terrible
to
be
cooped
up
here
in
this
little
flat
away
from
the
things
we
both
love
yes
dear
civilization
has
ruined
the
world
if
we
could
only
have
lived
a
thousand
years
ago
when
life
was
simple
and
natural
when
men
hunted
and
killed
their
meat
instead
of
drinking
synthetic
stuff
when
men
still
had
the
joys
of
conflict
instead
of
living
under
glass
like
flowers
if
we
could
only
go
somewhere
there
is
anywhere
to
go
i
write
about
the
west
africa
south
sea
islands
but
they
were
all
filled
up
two
hundred
years
ago
pleasure
resorts
sanatoriums
cities
factories
if
only
we
lived
on
venus
i
was
listening
to
a
lecture
on
the
television
last
night
the
speaker
said
that
the
planet
venus
is
younger
than
the
earth
that
it
has
not
cooled
so
much
it
has
a
thick
cloudy
atmosphere
and
low
rainy
forests
there
simple
elemental
life
there
like
earth
had
before
civilization
ruined
it
yes
kinsley
with
his
new
ray
telescope
that
penetrates
the
cloud
layers
of
the
planet
proved
that
venus
rotates
in
about
the
same
period
as
earth
and
it
must
be
much
like
earth
was
a
million
years
ago
eric
i
wonder
if
we
could
go
there
it
would
be
so
thrilling
to
begin
life
like
the
characters
in
your
stories
to
get
away
from
this
hateful
civilization
and
live
natural
lives
maybe
a
rocket
the
young
author
eyes
were
glowing
he
skipped
across
the
floor
seized
nada
kissed
her
ecstatically
splendid
think
of
hunting
in
the
virgin
forest
and
bringing
the
game
home
to
you
but
i
afraid
there
is
no
wait
the
cosmic
express
the
cosmic
express
a
new
invention
just
perfected
a
few
weeks
ago
i
understand
by
ludwig
von
der
valls
the
german
physicist
i
quit
bothering
about
science
it
has
ruined
nature
filled
the
world
with
silly
artificial
people
doing
silly
artificial
things
but
this
is
quite
remarkable
dear
a
new
way
to
travel
by
ether
by
ether
yes
you
know
of
course
that
energy
and
matter
are
interchangeable
terms
both
are
simply
etheric
vibration
of
different
sorts
of
course
that
elementary
she
smiled
proudly
i
can
give
you
examples
even
of
the
change
the
disintegration
of
the
radium
atom
making
helium
and
lead
and
and
millikan
old
proof
that
his
cosmic
ray
is
generated
when
particles
of
electricity
are
united
to
form
an
atom
fine
i
thought
you
said
you
were
a
scientist
he
glowed
with
pride
but
the
method
in
the
new
cosmic
express
is
simply
to
convert
the
matter
to
be
carried
into
power
send
it
out
as
a
radiant
beam
and
focus
the
beam
to
convert
it
back
into
atoms
at
the
destination
but
the
amount
of
energy
must
be
terrific
it
is
you
know
short
waves
carry
more
energy
than
long
ones
the
express
ray
is
an
electromagnetic
vibration
of
frequency
far
higher
than
that
of
even
the
cosmic
ray
and
correspondingly
more
powerful
and
more
penetrating
the
girl
frowned
running
slim
fingers
through
hair
but
i
do
see
how
they
get
any
recognizable
object
not
even
how
they
get
the
radiation
turned
back
into
matter
the
beam
is
focused
just
like
the
light
that
passes
through
a
camera
lens
the
photographic
lens
using
light
rays
picks
up
a
picture
and
reproduces
it
again
on
the
plate
just
the
same
as
the
express
ray
picks
up
an
object
and
sets
it
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
an
analogy
from
television
might
help
you
know
that
by
means
of
the
scanning
disc
the
picture
is
transformed
into
mere
rapid
fluctuations
in
the
brightness
of
a
beam
of
light
in
a
parallel
manner
the
focal
plane
of
the
express
ray
moves
slowly
through
the
object
progressively
dissolving
layers
of
the
thickness
of
a
single
atom
which
are
accurately
reproduced
at
the
other
focus
of
the
instrument
which
might
be
in
venus
but
the
analogy
of
the
lens
is
the
better
of
the
two
for
no
receiving
instrument
is
required
as
in
television
the
object
is
built
up
of
an
infinite
series
of
plane
layers
at
the
focus
of
the
ray
no
matter
where
that
may
be
such
a
thing
would
be
impossible
with
radio
apparatus
because
even
with
the
best
beam
transmission
all
but
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
power
is
lost
and
power
is
required
to
rebuild
the
atoms
do
you
understand
dear
not
altogether
but
i
should
worry
here
comes
breakfast
let
me
butter
your
toast
a
bell
had
rung
at
the
shaft
she
ran
to
it
and
returned
with
a
great
silver
tray
laden
with
dainty
dishes
which
she
set
on
a
little
side
table
they
sat
down
opposite
each
other
and
ate
getting
as
much
satisfaction
from
contemplation
of
each
other
faces
as
from
the
excellent
food
when
they
had
finished
she
carried
the
tray
to
the
shaft
slid
it
in
a
slot
and
touched
a
button
thus
disposing
of
the
culinary
cares
of
the
morning
she
ran
back
to
eric
who
was
once
more
staring
distastefully
at
his
typewriter
oh
darling
i
thrilled
to
death
about
the
cosmic
express
if
we
could
go
to
venus
to
a
new
life
on
a
new
world
and
get
away
from
all
this
hateful
conventional
society
we
can
go
to
their
office
it
only
five
minutes
the
chap
that
operates
the
machine
for
the
company
is
a
pal
of
mine
he
not
supposed
to
take
passengers
except
between
the
offices
they
have
scattered
about
the
world
but
i
know
his
weak
point
eric
laughed
fumbled
with
a
hidden
spring
under
his
desk
a
small
polished
object
gleaming
silvery
slid
down
into
his
hand
old
friendship
this
would
make
him
like
spinach
five
minutes
later
eric
and
his
pretty
wife
were
in
street
clothes
light
silk
tunics
of
loose
flowing
lines
little
clothing
being
required
in
the
artificially
warmed
city
they
entered
an
elevator
and
dropped
thirty
stories
to
the
ground
floor
of
the
great
building
there
they
entered
a
cylindrical
car
with
rows
of
seats
down
the
sides
not
greatly
different
from
an
ancient
subway
car
except
that
it
was
and
was
hurled
by
magnetic
attraction
and
repulsion
through
a
tube
exhausted
of
air
at
a
speed
that
would
have
made
an
old
subway
rider
gasp
with
amazement
in
five
more
minutes
their
car
had
whipped
up
to
the
base
of
another
building
in
the
business
section
where
there
was
no
room
for
parks
between
the
mighty
structures
that
held
the
unbroken
glass
roofs
two
hundred
stories
above
the
concrete
pavement
an
elevator
brought
them
up
a
hundred
and
fifty
stories
eric
led
nada
down
a
long
carpeted
corridor
to
a
wide
glass
door
which
bore
the
words
cosmic
express
stenciled
in
gold
capitals
across
it
as
they
approached
a
lean
man
carrying
a
black
bag
darted
out
of
an
elevator
shaft
opposite
the
door
ran
across
the
corridor
and
entered
they
pushed
in
after
him
they
were
in
a
little
room
cut
in
two
by
a
high
brass
grill
in
front
of
it
was
a
long
bench
against
the
wall
that
reminded
one
of
the
waiting
room
in
an
old
railroad
depot
in
the
grill
was
a
little
window
with
a
lazy
youth
leaning
on
the
shelf
behind
it
beyond
him
was
a
great
glittering
piece
of
mechanism
half
hidden
by
the
brass
a
little
door
gave
access
to
the
machine
from
the
space
before
the
grill
the
thin
man
in
black
whom
eric
now
recognized
as
a
prominent
french
was
dancing
before
the
window
waving
his
bag
frantically
raving
at
the
sleepy
boy

experimental
service

world
in
a
year
ready
now
come
on
in
the
youth
took
the
money
pressed
a
button
the
door
sprang
open
in
the
grill
and
the
frantic
physician
leaped
through
it
lie
down
on
the
crystal
face
up
the
young
man
ordered
hands
at
your
sides
do
breathe
ready
he
manipulated
his
dials
and
switches
and
pressed
another
button
why
hello
eric
old
man
he
cried
that
the
lady
you
were
telling
me
about
congratulations
a
bell
jangled
before
him
on
the
panel
just
a
minute
i
got
a
call
he
punched
the
board
again
little
bulbs
lit
and
glowed
for
a
second
the
youth
turned
toward
the
machine
spoke
courteously
all
right
madam
walk
out
hope
you
found
the
transit
pleasant
but
my
violet
my
precious
violet
a
shrill
female
voice
came
from
the
machine
sir

have
you
done
with
my
darling
violet
i
sure
i
do
know
madam
you
lost
it
off
your
hat
none
of
your
impertinence
sir

want
my
dog

dog
must
have
jumped
off
the
crystal
you
can
have
him
sent
on
for
three
hundred
and
young
man
if
any
harm
comes
to
my
violet
i
i
i
appeal
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
very
good
madam
we
appreciate
your
patronage
the
door
flew
open
again
a
very
fat
woman
puffing
angrily
face
highly
colored
clothing
shimmering
with
artificial
gems
waddled
pompously
out
of
the
door
through
which
the
frantic
french
doctor
had
so
recently
vanished
she
rolled
heavily
across
the
room
and
out
into
the
corridor
shrill
words
floated
back
i
going
to
see
my
lawyer
my
precious
violet
the
sallow
youth
winked
and
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
eric
we
want
to
go
to
venus
if
that
ray
of
yours
can
put
us
there
to
venus
impossible
my
orders
are
to
use
the
express
merely
between
the
sixteen
designated
stations
at
new
york
san
francisco
tokyo
london
paris
see
here
charley
with
a
cautious
glance
toward
the
door
eric
held
up
the
silver
flask
for
old
time
sake
and
for
this
the
boy
seemed
dazed
at
sight
of
the
bright
flask
then
with
a
single
swift
motion
he
snatched
it
out
of
eric
hand
and
bent
to
conceal
it
below
his
instrument
panel
sure
old
boy
i
send
you
to
heaven
for
that
if
you
give
me
the
micrometer
readings
to
set
the
ray
with
but
i
tell
you
this
is
dangerous
i
got
a
sort
of
television
attachment
for
focusing
the
ray
i
can
turn
that
on
venus
i
been
amusing
myself
watching
the
life
there
already
terrible
place
savage
i
can
pick
a
place
on
high
land
to
set
you
down
but
i
ca
be
responsible
for
what
happens
afterward
simple
primitive
life
is
what
we
looking
for
and
now
what
do
i
owe
you
oh
that
all
right
between
friends
provided
that
stuff
genuine
walk
in
and
lie
down
on
the
crystal
block
hands
at
your
sides
move
the
little
door
had
swung
open
again
and
eric
led
nada
through
they
stepped
into
a
little
cell
completely
surrounded
with
mirrors
and
vast
prisms
and
lenses
and
electron
tubes
in
the
center
was
a
slab
of
transparent
crystal
eight
feet
square
and
two
inches
thick
with
an
intricate
mass
of
machinery
below
it
eric
helped
nada
to
a
place
on
the
crystal
lay
down
at
her
side
i
think
the
express
ray
is
focused
just
at
the
surface
of
the
crystal
from
below
he
said
it
dissolves
our
substance
to
be
transmitted
by
the
beam
it
would
look
as
if
we
were
melting
into
the
crystal
ready
called
the
youth
think
i
got
it
for
you
sort
of
a
high
island
in
the
jungle
nothing
bad
in
sight
now
but
i
say
how
you
coming
back
i
have
got
time
to
watch
you
go
ahead
we
are
coming
back
gee
what
is
it
elopement
i
thought
you
were
married
already
or
is
it
business
difficulties
the
bears
did
make
an
awful
raid
last
night
but
you
better
let
me
set
you
down
in
hong
kong
a
bell
jangled
so
long
the
youth
called
nada
and
eric
felt
themselves
enveloped
in
fire
sheets
of
white
flame
seemed
to
lap
up
about
them
from
the
crystal
block
suddenly
there
was
a
sharp
tingling
sensation
where
they
touched
the
polished
surface
then
blackness
blankness
the
next
thing
they
knew
the
fires
were
gone
from
about
them
they
were
lying
in
something
extremely
soft
and
fluid
and
warm
rain
was
beating
in
their
faces
eric
sat
up
found
himself
in
a
beside
him
was
nada
opening
her
eyes
and
struggling
up
her
bright
garments
stained
with
black
mud
all
about
rose
a
thick
jungle
dark
and
gloomy
and
very
wet
the
gigantic
trees
were
or
flinging
clouds
of
feathery
green
foliage
high
against
a
somber
sky
of
unbroken
gloom
they
stood
up
triumphant
at
last
nada
cried
we
free
free
of
that
hateful
old
civilization
we
back
to
nature
yes
we
on
our
feet
now
not
parasites
on
the
machines
it
wonderful
to
have
a
fine
strong
man
like
you
to
trust
in
eric
you
just
like
one
of
the
heroes
in
your
books
you
the
perfect
companion
nada
but
now
we
must
be
practical
we
must
build
a
fire
find
weapons
set
up
a
shelter
of
some
kind
i
guess
it
will
be
night
pretty
soon
and
charley
said
something
about
savage
animals
he
had
seen
in
the
television
we
find
a
nice
dry
cave
and
have
a
fire
in
front
of
the
door
and
skins
of
animals
to
sleep
on
and
pottery
vessels
to
cook
in
and
you
will
find
seeds
and
grown
grain
but
first
we
must
find
a
we
need
flint
for
tools
and
to
strike
sparks
to
make
a
fire
with
we
will
probably
come
across
a
chunk
of
virgin
copper
too
it
found
native
presently
they
set
off
through
the
jungle
the
mud
seemed
to
be
very
abundant
and
of
a
most
sticky
consistence
they
sank
into
it
ankle
deep
at
every
step
and
vast
masses
of
it
clung
to
their
feet
a
mile
they
struggled
on
without
finding
where
a
provident
nature
had
left
them
even
a
single
fragment
of
quartz
to
say
nothing
of
a
mass
of
pure
copper
a
darned
shame
eric
grumbled
to
come
forty
million
miles
and
meet
such
a
reception
as
this
nada
stopped
eric
she
said
i
tired
and
i
do
believe
any
rock
here
anyway
you
have
to
use
wooden
tools
sharpened
in
the
fire
probably
you
right
this
soil
seemed
to
be
of
alluvial
origin
should
be
surprised
if
the
native
rock
is
some
hundreds
of
feet
underground
your
idea
is
better
you
can
make
a
fire
by
rubbing
sticks
together
ca
you
it
can
be
done
i
sure
i
never
tried
it
myself
we
need
some
dry
sticks
first
they
resumed
the
weary
march
with
a
good
fraction
of
the
new
planet
adhering
to
their
feet
rain
was
still
falling
from
the
dark
heavens
in
a
steady
warm
downpour
dry
wood
seemed
scarce
as
the
proverbial
teeth
you
did
bring
any
matches
dear
matches
of
course
not
we
going
back
to
nature
i
hope
we
get
a
fire
pretty
soon
if
dry
wood
were
gold
dust
we
could
buy
a
hot
dog
eric
that
reminds
me
that
i
hungry
he
confessed
to
a
few
pangs
of
his
own
they
turned
their
attention
to
looking
for
banana
trees
and
coconut
palms
but
they
did
not
seem
to
abound
in
the
venerian
jungle
even
small
animals
that
might
have
been
slain
with
a
broken
branch
had
contrary
ideas
about
the
matter
at
last
from
sheer
weariness
they
stopped
and
gathered
branches
to
make
a
sloping
shelter
by
a
vast
fallen
this
will
keep
out
the
rain
maybe
eric
said
hopefully
and
tomorrow
when
it
has
quit
raining
i
sure
we
do
better
they
crept
in
as
gloomy
night
fell
without
they
lay
in
each
arms
the
body
warmth
oddly
comforting
nada
cried
a
little
buck
up
eric
advised
her
we
back
to
nature
where
we
always
wanted
to
be
with
the
darkness
the
temperature
fell
somewhat
and
a
high
wind
rose
whipping
cold
rain
into
the
little
shelter
and
threatening
to
demolish
it
swarms
of
insects
seemingly
not
inconvenienced
in
the
least
by
the
inclement
elements
swarmed
about
them
in
clouds
then
came
a
sound
from
the
dismal
stormy
night
a
hoarse
bellowing
roar
raucous
terrifying
nada
clung
against
eric
what
is
it
dear
she
chattered
must
be
a
reptile
dinosaur
or
something
of
the
sort
this
world
seems
to
be
in
about
the
same
state
as
the
earth
when
they
flourished
there
but
maybe
it
wo
find
us
the
roar
was
repeated
nearer
the
earth
trembled
beneath
a
mighty
tread
eric
a
thin
voice
trembled
do
you
think
it
might
have
been
better
you
know
the
old
life
was
not
so
bad
after
all
i
was
just
thinking
of
our
rooms
nice
and
warm
and
bright
with
hot
foods
coming
up
the
shaft
whenever
we
pushed
the
button
and
the
gay
crowds
in
the
park
and
my
old
typewriter
eric
she
called
softly
yes
dear
do
you
wish
we
had
known
better
i
do
if
he
winced
at
the
we
the
girl
did
not
notice
the
roaring
outside
was
closer
and
suddenly
it
was
answered
by
another
raucous
bellow
at
considerable
distance
that
echoed
strangely
through
the
forest
the
fearful
sounds
were
repeated
alternately
and
always
the
more
distant
seemed
nearer
until
the
two
sounds
were
together
and
then
an
infernal
din
broke
out
in
the
darkness
bellows
screams
deafening
shrieks
mighty
splashes
as
if
struggling
titans
had
upset
oceans
thunderous
crashes
as
if
they
were
demolishing
forests
eric
and
nada
clung
to
each
other
in
doubt
whether
to
stay
or
to
fly
through
the
storm
gradually
the
sound
of
the
conflict
came
nearer
until
the
earth
shook
beneath
them
and
they
were
afraid
to
move
suddenly
the
great
fallen
tree
against
which
they
had
erected
the
flimsy
shelter
was
rolled
back
evidently
by
a
chance
blow
from
the
invisible
monsters
the
pitiful
roof
collapsed
on
the
bedraggled
humans
nada
burst
into
tears
oh
if
only
if
only
suddenly
flame
lapped
up
about
them
the
same
white
fire
they
had
seen
as
they
lay
on
the
crystal
block
dizziness
insensibility
overcame
them
a
few
moments
later
they
were
lying
on
the
transparent
table
in
the
cosmic
express
office
with
all
those
great
mirrors
and
prisms
and
lenses
about
them
a
bustling
official
appeared
through
the
door
in
the
grill
fairly
bubbling
apologies
so
sorry
an
accident
inconceivable
i
ca
see
how
he
got
it

two
more
passengers
registered
here
than
had
been
recorded
at
our
other
stations
i
looked
up
the
duplicate
beam
coordinates
and
found
that

been
set
on
venus

got
men
on
the
television
at
once

life

a
hearty
meal
with
his
pretty
spouse
after
they
had
washed
off
the
grime
of
another
planet
he
spent
the
next
twelve
hours
in
bed
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
delivered
his
promised
story

his
publishers

on
venus

beautiful
