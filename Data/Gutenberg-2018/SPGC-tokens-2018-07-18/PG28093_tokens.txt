i
said
tell
me
something
about
yourself
why
what
would
you
have
me
tell
you
everybody
knows
my
life
replied
lupin
who
lay
drowsing
on
the
sofa
in
my
study
nobody
knows
it
i
protested
people
know
from
your
letters
in
the
newspapers
that
you
were
mixed
up
in
this
case
that
you
started
that
case
but
the
part
which
you
played
in
it
all
the
plain
facts
of
the
story
the
upshot
of
the
mystery
these
are
things
of
which
they
know
nothing
pooh
a
heap
of
uninteresting
twaddle
what
your
present
of
fifty
thousand
francs
to
nicolas
dugrival
wife
do
you
call
that
uninteresting
and
what
about
the
way
in
which
you
solved
the
puzzle
of
the
three
pictures
lupin
laughed
yes
that
was
a
queer
puzzle
certainly
i
can
suggest
a
title
for
you
if
you
like
what
do
you
say
to
sign
of
the
and
your
successes
in
society
and
with
the
fair
sex
i
continued
the
dashing
arsène
and
the
clue
to
your
good
actions
those
chapters
in
your
life
to
which
you
have
so
often
alluded
under
the
names
of
by
and
so
on
why
delay
these
confidences
and
confessions
my
dear
lupin
come
do
what
i
ask
you
it
was
at
the
time
when
lupin
though
already
famous
had
not
yet
fought
his
biggest
battles
the
time
that
preceded
the
great
adventures
of
hollow
and
he
had
not
yet
dreamt
of
annexing
the
accumulated
treasures
of
the
french
royal
house
a
nor
of
changing
the
map
of
europe
under
the
kaiser
nose
b
he
contented
himself
with
milder
surprises
and
humbler
profits
making
his
daily
effort
doing
evil
from
day
to
day
and
doing
a
little
good
as
well
naturally
and
for
the
love
of
the
thing
like
a
whimsical
and
compassionate

boon
he
was
silent
and
i
insisted
lupin
i
wish
you
would
to
my
astonishment
he
replied
take
a
sheet
of
paper
old
fellow
and
a
pencil
i
obeyed
with
alacrity
delighted
at
the
thought
that
he
at
last
meant
to
dictate
to
me
some
of
those
pages
which
he
knows
how
to
clothe
with
such
vigour
and
fancy
pages
which
i
unfortunately
am
obliged
to
spoil
with
tedious
explanations
and
boring
developments
are
you
ready
he
asked
quite
write
down
what
write
it
down
i
tell
you
he
was
now
sitting
up
with
his
eyes
turned
to
the
open
window
and
his
fingers
rolling
a
turkish
cigarette
he
continued
write
down
he
stopped
then
he
went
on
and
after
a
pause
was
he
mad
i
looked
at
him
hard
and
presently
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
no
longer
listless
as
they
had
been
a
little
before
but
keen
and
attentive
and
that
they
seemed
to
be
watching
somewhere
in
space
a
sight
that
apparently
captivated
them
meanwhile
he
dictated
with
intervals
between
each
number
there
was
hardly
anything
to
be
seen
through
the
window
but
a
patch
of
blue
sky
on
the
right
and
the
front
of
the
building
opposite
an
old
private
house
whose
shutters
were
closed
as
usual
there
was
nothing
particular
about
all
this
no
detail
that
struck
me
as
new
among
those
which
i
had
had
before
my
eyes
for
years
and
suddenly
i
understood
or
rather
i
thought
i
understood
for
how
could
i
admit
that
lupin
a
man
so
essentially
under
his
mask
of
frivolity
could
waste
his
time
upon
such
childish
nonsense
what
he
was
counting
was
the
intermittent
flashes
of
a
ray
of
sunlight
playing
on
the
dingy
front
of
the
opposite
house
at
the
height
of
the
second
floor
said
lupin
the
flash
disappeared
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
struck
the
house
again
successively
at
regular
intervals
and
disappeared
once
more
i
had
instinctively
counted
the
flashes
and
i
said
aloud
caught
the
idea
i
congratulate
you
he
replied
sarcastically
he
went
to
the
window
and
leant
out
as
though
to
discover
the
exact
direction
followed
by
the
ray
of
light
then
he
came
and
lay
on
the
sofa
again
saying
it
your
turn
now
count
away
the
fellow
seemed
so
positive
that
i
did
as
he
told
me
besides
i
could
not
help
confessing
that
there
was
something
rather
curious
about
the
ordered
frequency
of
those
gleams
on
the
front
of
the
house
opposite
those
appearances
and
disappearances
turn
and
turn
about
like
so
many
flash
signals
they
obviously
came
from
a
house
on
our
side
of
the
street
for
the
sun
was
entering
my
windows
slantwise
it
was
as
though
some
one
were
alternately
opening
and
shutting
a
casement
or
more
likely
amusing
himself
by
making
sunlight
flashes
with
a
it
a
child
having
a
game
i
cried
after
a
moment
or
two
feeling
a
little
irritated
by
the
trivial
occupation
that
had
been
thrust
upon
me
never
mind
go
on
and
i
counted
away
and
i
put
down
rows
of
figures
and
the
sun
continued
to
play
in
front
of
me
with
mathematical
precision
well
said
lupin
after
a
longer
pause
than
usual
why
it
seems
finished
there
has
been
nothing
for
some
minutes
we
waited
and
as
no
more
light
flashed
through
space
i
said
jestingly
my
idea
is
that
we
have
been
wasting
our
time
a
few
figures
on
paper
a
poor
result
lupin
without
stirring
from
his
sofa
rejoined
oblige
me
old
chap
by
putting
in
the
place
of
each
of
those
numbers
the
corresponding
letter
of
the
alphabet
count
a
as
b
as
and
so
on
do
you
follow
me
but
it
idiotic
absolutely
idiotic
but
we
do
such
a
lot
of
idiotic
things
in
this
life
one
more
or
less
you
know
i
sat
down
to
this
silly
work
and
wrote
out
the
first
letters
no
i
broke
off
in
surprise
words
i
exclaimed
two
english
words
meaning
go
on
old
chap
and
i
went
on
and
the
next
letters
formed
two
more
words
which
i
separated
as
they
appeared
and
to
my
great
amazement
a
complete
english
sentence
lay
before
my
eyes
done
asked
lupin
after
a
time
done
by
the
way
there
are
mistakes
in
the
spelling
never
mind
those
and
read
it
out
please
read
slowly
thereupon
i
read
out
the
following
unfinished
communication
which
i
will
set
down
as
it
appeared
on
the
paper
in
front
of
me
no
unnecessery
risks
above
all
avoid
atacks
approach
ennemy
with
great
prudance
and
i
began
to
laugh
and
there
you
are
lux
we
simply
dazed
with
light
but
after
all
lupin
confess
that
this
advice
dribbled
out
by
a
does
help
you
much
lupin
rose
without
breaking
his
contemptuous
silence
and
took
the
sheet
of
paper
i
remembered
soon
after
that
at
this
moment
i
happened
to
look
at
the
clock
it
was
eighteen
minutes
past
five
lupin
was
standing
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
i
was
able
at
my
ease
to
watch
on
his
youthful
features
that
extraordinary
mobility
of
expression
which
baffles
all
observers
and
constitutes
his
great
strength
and
his
chief
safeguard
by
what
signs
can
one
hope
to
identify
a
face
which
changes
at
pleasure
even
without
the
help
of
and
whose
every
transient
expression
seems
to
be
the
final
definite
expression
by
what
signs
there
was
one
which
i
knew
well
an
invariable
sign
two
little
crossed
wrinkles
that
marked
his
forehead
whenever
he
made
a
powerful
effort
of
concentration
and
i
saw
it
at
that
moment
saw
the
tiny
cross
plainly
and
deeply
scored
he
put
down
the
sheet
of
paper
and
muttered
child
play
the
clock
struck
five
what
i
cried
have
you
succeeded
in
twelve
minutes
he
took
a
few
steps
up
and
down
the
room
lit
a
cigarette
and
said
you
might
ring
up
baron
repstein
if
you
do
mind
and
tell
him
i
shall
be
with
him
at
ten
this
evening
baron
repstein
i
asked
the
husband
of
the
famous
baroness
yes
are
you
serious
quite
serious
feeling
absolutely
at
a
loss
but
incapable
of
resisting
him
i
opened
the
and
unhooked
the
receiver
but
at
that
moment
lupin
stopped
me
with
a
peremptory
gesture
and
said
with
his
eyes
on
the
paper
which
he
had
taken
up
again
no
do
say
anything
it
no
use
letting
him
know
something
more
urgent
a
queer
thing
that
puzzles
me
why
on
earth
was
the
last
sentence
finished
why
is
the
sentence
he
snatched
up
his
hat
and
stick
let
be
off
if
i
not
mistaken
this
is
a
business
that
requires
immediate
solution
and
i
do
believe
i
mistaken
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
as
we
went
down
the
stairs
and
said
i
know
what
everybody
knows
baron
repstein
the
and
whose
colt
etna
won
the
derby
and
the
grand
prix
this
year
has
been
victimized
by
his
wife
the
wife
who
was
well
known
for
her
fair
hair
her
dress
and
her
extravagance
ran
away
a
fortnight
ago
taking
with
her
a
sum
of
three
million
francs
stolen
from
her
husband
and
quite
a
collection
of
diamonds
pearls
and
jewellery
which
the
princesse
de
berny
had
placed
in
her
hands
and
which
she
was
supposed
to
buy
for
two
weeks
the
police
have
been
pursuing
the
baroness
across
france
and
the
continent
an
easy
job
as
she
scatters
gold
and
jewels
wherever
she
goes
they
think
they
have
her
every
moment
two
days
ago
our
champion
detective
the
egregious
ganimard
arrested
a
visitor
at
a
big
hotel
in
belgium
a
woman
against
whom
the
most
positive
evidence
seemed
to
be
heaped
up
on
enquiry
the
lady
turned
out
to
be
a
notorious
called
nelly
darbal
as
for
the
baroness
she
has
vanished
the
baron
on
his
side
has
offered
a
reward
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
to
whosoever
finds
his
wife
the
money
is
in
the
hands
of
a
solicitor
moreover
he
has
sold
his
his
house
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
and
his
of
roquencourt
in
one
lump
so
that
he
may
indemnify
the
princesse
de
berny
for
her
loss
and
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
i
added
are
to
be
paid
over
at
once
the
papers
say
that
the
princess
will
have
her
money
only
frankly
i
fail
to
see
the
connection
between
this
story
which
you
have
told
very
well
and
the
puzzling
sentence
lupin
did
not
condescend
to
reply
we
had
been
walking
down
the
street
in
which
i
live
and
had
passed
some
four
or
five
houses
when
he
stepped
off
the
pavement
and
began
to
examine
a
block
of
flats
not
of
the
latest
construction
which
looked
as
if
it
contained
a
large
number
of
tenants
according
to
my
calculations
he
said
this
is
where
the
signals
came
from
probably
from
that
open
window
on
the
third
floor
yes
he
went
to
the
portress
and
asked
her
does
one
of
your
tenants
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
baron
repstein
why
of
course
replied
the
woman
we
have
lavernoux
here
such
a
nice
gentleman
he
is
the
baron
secretary
and
agent
i
look
after
his
flat
and
can
we
see
him
see
him
the
poor
gentleman
is
very
ill
he
been
ill
a
fortnight
ever
since
the
trouble
with
the
baroness
he
came
home
the
next
day
with
a
temperature
and
took
to
his
bed
but
he
gets
up
surely
ah
that
i
ca
say
how
do
you
mean
you
ca
say
no
his
doctor
wo
let
any
one
into
his
room
he
took
my
key
from
me
who
did
the
doctor
he
comes
and
sees
to
his
wants
two
or
three
times
a
day
he
left
the
house
only
twenty
minutes
ago
an
old
gentleman
with
a
grey
beard
and
spectacles
walks
quite
bent
but
where
are
you
going
sir
i
going
up
show
me
the
way
said
lupin
with
his
foot
on
the
stairs
it
the
third
floor
is
it
on
the
left
but
i
must
moaned
the
portress
running
after
him
besides
i
have
the
key
the
doctor
they
climbed
the
three
flights
one
behind
the
other
on
the
landing
lupin
took
a
tool
from
his
pocket
and
disregarding
the
protests
inserted
it
in
the
lock
the
door
yielded
almost
immediately
we
went
in
at
the
back
of
a
small
dark
room
we
saw
a
streak
of
light
filtering
through
a
door
that
had
been
left
ajar
lupin
ran
across
the
room
and
on
reaching
the
threshold
gave
a
cry
too
late
oh
hang
it
all
the
portress
fell
on
her
knees
as
though
fainting
i
entered
the
bedroom
in
my
turn
and
saw
a
man
lying
on
the
carpet
with
his
legs
drawn
up
under
him
his
arms
contorted
and
his
face
quite
white
an
emaciated
fleshless
face
with
the
eyes
still
staring
in
terror
and
the
mouth
twisted
into
a
hideous
grin
he
dead
said
lupin
after
a
rapid
examination
but
why
i
exclaimed
there
not
a
trace
of
blood
yes
yes
there
is
replied
lupin
pointing
to
two
or
three
drops
that
showed
on
the
chest
through
the
open
shirt
look
they
must
have
taken
him
by
the
throat
with
one
hand
and
pricked
him
to
the
heart
with
the
other
i
say
because
really
the
wound
ca
be
seen
it
suggests
a
hole
made
by
a
very
long
needle
illustration
took
a
tool
from
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
in
the
he
looked
on
the
floor
all
round
the
corpse
there
was
nothing
to
attract
his
attention
except
a
little
the
little
mirror
with
which
lavernoux
had
amused
himself
by
making
the
sunbeams
dance
through
space
but
suddenly
as
the
portress
was
breaking
into
lamentations
and
calling
for
help
lupin
flung
himself
on
her
and
shook
her
stop
that
listen
to
me
you
can
call
out
later
listen
to
me
and
answer
me
it
is
most
important
lavernoux
had
a
friend
living
in
this
street
had
he
not
on
the
same
side
to
the
right
an
intimate
friend
yes
a
friend
whom
he
used
to
meet
at
the
café
in
the
evening
and
with
whom
he
exchanged
the
illustrated
papers
yes
was
the
friend
an
englishman
yes
what
his
name
mr
hargrove
where
does
he
live
at
no
in
this
street
one
word
more
had
that
old
doctor
been
attending
him
long
no
i
did
not
know
him
he
came
on
the
evening
when
lavernoux
was
taken
without
another
word
lupin
dragged
me
away
once
more
ran
down
the
stairs
and
once
in
the
street
turned
to
the
right
which
took
us
past
my
flat
again
four
doors
further
he
stopped
at
no
a
small
house
of
which
the
was
occupied
by
the
proprietor
of
a
who
stood
smoking
in
his
doorway
next
to
the
lupin
asked
if
hargrove
was
at
home
hargrove
went
out
about
ago
said
the
publican
he
seemed
very
much
excited
and
took
a
a
thing
he
does
often
do
and
you
do
know
where
he
was
going
well
there
no
secret
about
it
he
shouted
it
loud
enough
of
police
is
what
he
said
to
the
driver
lupin
was
himself
just
hailing
a
taxi
when
he
changed
his
mind
and
i
heard
him
mutter
what
the
good
he
got
too
much
start
of
us
he
asked
if
any
one
called
after
hargrove
had
gone
yes
an
old
gentleman
with
a
grey
beard
and
spectacles
he
went
up
to
hargrove
rang
the
bell
and
went
away
again
i
am
much
obliged
said
lupin
touching
his
hat
he
walked
away
slowly
without
speaking
to
me
wearing
a
thoughtful
air
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
problem
struck
him
as
very
difficult
and
that
he
saw
none
too
clearly
in
the
darkness
through
which
he
seemed
to
be
moving
with
such
certainty
he
himself
for
that
matter
confessed
to
me
these
are
cases
that
require
much
more
intuition
than
reflection
but
this
one
i
may
tell
you
is
well
worth
taking
pains
about
we
had
now
reached
the
boulevards
lupin
entered
a
public
and
spent
a
long
time
consulting
the
last
fortnight
newspapers
now
and
again
he
mumbled
yes
yes
of
course
it
only
a
guess
but
it
explains
everything
well
a
guess
that
answers
every
question
is
not
far
from
being
the
truth
it
was
now
dark
we
dined
at
a
little
restaurant
and
i
noticed
that
lupin
face
became
gradually
more
animated
his
gestures
were
more
decided
he
recovered
his
spirits
his
liveliness
when
we
left
during
the
walk
which
he
made
me
take
along
the
boulevard
haussmann
towards
baron
repstein
house
he
was
the
real
lupin
of
the
great
occasions
the
lupin
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
in
and
win
we
slackened
our
pace
just
short
of
the
rue
de
courcelles
baron
repstein
lived
on
the
side
between
this
street
and
the
faubourg
in
a
private
house
of
which
we
could
see
the
front
decorated
with
columns
and
caryatides
stop
said
lupin
suddenly
what
is
it
another
proof
to
confirm
my
supposition
what
proof
i
see
nothing
i
do
that
enough
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
coat
lowered
the
brim
of
his
soft
hat
and
said
by
jove
it
be
a
stiff
fight
go
to
bed
my
friend
i
tell
you
about
my
expedition
if
it
does
cost
me
my
life
what
are
you
talking
about
oh
i
know
what
i
saying
i
risking
a
lot
first
of
all
getting
arrested
which
is
much
next
getting
killed
which
is
worse
but
he
gripped
my
shoulder
but
there
a
third
thing
i
risking
which
is
getting
hold
of
two
millions
and
once
i
possess
a
capital
of
two
millions
i
show
people
what
i
can
do
old
chap
and
if
you
never
see
me
again
he
spouted
musset
lines
plant
a
willow
by
my
grave
the
weeping
willow
that
i
love
i
walked
away
three
minutes
later
i
am
continuing
the
narrative
as
he
told
it
to
me
next
day
three
minutes
later
lupin
rang
at
the
door
of
the
hôtel
repstein
is
monsieur
le
baron
at
home
yes
replied
the
butler
examining
the
intruder
with
an
air
of
surprise
but
monsieur
le
baron
does
not
see
people
as
late
as
this
does
monsieur
le
baron
know
of
the
murder
of
lavernoux
his
certainly
well
please
tell
monsieur
le
baron
that
i
have
come
about
the
murder
and
that
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
a
voice
called
from
above
show
the
gentleman
up
antoine
in
obedience
to
this
peremptory
order
the
butler
led
the
way
to
the
first
floor
in
an
open
doorway
stood
a
gentleman
whom
lupin
recognized
from
his
photograph
in
the
papers
as
baron
repstein
husband
of
the
famous
baroness
and
owner
of
etna
the
horse
of
the
year
he
was
an
exceedingly
tall
man
his
face
wore
a
pleasant
almost
smiling
expression
which
was
not
affected
by
the
sadness
of
his
eyes
he
was
dressed
in
a
with
a
tan
waistcoat
and
a
dark
tie
fastened
with
a
pearl
pin
the
value
of
which
struck
lupin
as
considerable
he
took
lupin
into
his
study
a
large
room
lined
with
sets
of
pigeonholes
an
american
desk
and
a
safe
and
he
at
once
asked
with
eagerness
do
you
know
anything
yes
monsieur
le
baron
about
the
murder
of
that
poor
lavernoux
yes
monsieur
le
baron
and
about
madame
le
baronne
also
do
you
really
mean
it
quick
i
entreat
you
he
pushed
forward
a
chair
lupin
sat
down
and
began
monsieur
le
baron
the
circumstances
are
very
serious
i
will
be
brief
yes
do
please
well
monsieur
le
baron
in
a
few
words
it
amounts
to
this
five
or
six
hours
ago
lavernoux
who
for
the
last
fortnight
had
been
kept
in
a
sort
of
enforced
confinement
by
his
doctor
lavernoux
how
shall
i
put
it
telegraphed
certain
revelations
by
means
of
signals
which
were
partly
taken
down
by
me
and
which
put
me
on
the
track
of
this
case
he
himself
was
surprised
in
the
act
of
making
this
communication
and
was
murdered
but
by
whom
by
whom
by
his
doctor
who
is
this
doctor
i
do
know
but
one
of
lavernoux
friends
an
englishman
called
hargrove
the
friend
in
fact
with
whom
he
was
communicating
is
bound
to
know
and
is
also
bound
to
know
the
exact
and
complete
meaning
of
the
communication
because
without
waiting
for
the
end
he
jumped
into
a
and
drove
to
the
prefecture
of
police
why
why
and
what
is
the
result
of
that
step
the
result
monsieur
le
baron
is
that
your
house
is
surrounded
there
are
twelve
detectives
under
your
windows
the
moment
the
sun
rises
they
will
enter
in
the
name
of
the
law
and
arrest
the
criminal
then
is
lavernoux
murderer
concealed
in
my
house
who
is
he
one
of
the
servants
but
no
for
you
were
speaking
of
a
doctor
i
would
remark
monsieur
le
baron
that
when
this
hargrove
went
to
the
police
to
tell
them
of
the
revelations
made
by
his
friend
lavernoux
he
was
not
aware
that
his
friend
lavernoux
was
going
to
be
murdered
the
step
taken
by
mr
hargrove
had
to
do
with
something
else
with
what
with
the
disappearance
of
madame
la
baronne
of
which
he
knew
the
secret
thanks
to
the
communication
made
by
lavernoux
what
they
know
at
last
they
have
found
the
baroness
where
is
she
and
the
jewels
and
the
money
she
robbed
me
of
baron
repstein
was
talking
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
he
rose
and
almost
shouting
at
lupin
cried
finish
your
story
sir
i
ca
endure
this
suspense
lupin
continued
in
a
slow
and
hesitating
voice
the
fact
is
you
see
it
is
rather
difficult
to
explain
for
you
and
i
are
looking
at
the
thing
from
a
totally
different
point
of
view
i
do
understand
and
yet
you
ought
to
understand
monsieur
le
baron
we
begin
by
saying
i
am
quoting
the
newspapers
by
saying
do
we
not
that
baroness
repstein
knew
all
the
secrets
of
your
business
and
that
she
was
able
to
open
not
only
that
safe
over
there
but
also
the
one
at
the
crédit
lyonnais
in
which
you
kept
your
securities
locked
up
yes
well
one
evening
a
fortnight
ago
while
you
were
at
your
club
baroness
repstein
who
unknown
to
yourself
had
converted
all
those
securities
into
cash
left
this
house
with
a
containing
your
money
and
all
the
princesse
de
berny
jewels
yes
and
since
then
she
has
not
been
seen
no
well
there
is
an
excellent
reason
why
she
has
not
been
seen
what
reason
this
that
baroness
repstein
has
been
murdered
murdered
the
baroness
but
you
mad
murdered
and
probably
that
same
evening
i
tell
you
again
you
are
mad
how
can
the
baroness
have
been
murdered
when
the
police
are
following
her
tracks
so
to
speak
step
by
step
they
are
following
the
tracks
of
another
woman
what
woman
the
murderer
accomplice
and
who
is
the
murderer
the
same
man
who
for
the
last
fortnight
knowing
that
lavernoux
through
the
situation
which
he
occupied
in
this
house
had
discovered
the
truth
kept
him
imprisoned
forced
him
to
silence
threatened
him
terrorized
him
the
same
man
who
finding
lavernoux
in
the
act
of
communicating
with
a
friend
made
away
with
him
in
cold
blood
by
stabbing
him
to
the
heart
the
doctor
therefore
yes
but
who
is
this
doctor
who
is
this
malevolent
genius
this
infernal
being
who
appears
and
disappears
who
slays
in
the
dark
and
whom
nobody
suspects
ca
you
guess
no
and
do
you
want
to
know
do
i
want
to
know
why
speak
man
speak
you
know
where
he
is
hiding
yes
in
this
house
yes
and
it
is
he
whom
the
police
are
after
yes
and
i
know
him
yes
who
is
it
you
i
lupin
had
not
been
more
than
ten
minutes
with
the
baron
and
the
duel
was
commencing
the
accusation
was
hurled
definitely
violently
implacably
lupin
repeated
you
yourself
got
up
in
a
false
beard
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
bent
in
two
like
an
old
man
in
short
you
baron
repstein
and
it
is
you
for
a
very
good
reason
of
which
nobody
has
thought
which
is
that
if
it
was
not
you
who
contrived
the
whole
plot
the
case
becomes
inexplicable
whereas
taking
you
as
the
criminal
you
as
murdering
the
baroness
in
order
to
get
rid
of
her
and
run
through
those
millions
with
another
woman
you
as
murdering
lavernoux
your
agent
in
order
to
suppress
an
unimpeachable
witness
oh
then
the
whole
case
is
explained
well
is
it
pretty
clear
and
are
not
you
yourself
convinced
the
baron
who
throughout
this
conversation
had
stood
bending
over
his
visitor
waiting
for
each
of
his
words
with
feverish
avidity
now
drew
himself
up
and
looked
at
lupin
as
though
he
undoubtedly
had
to
do
with
a
madman
when
lupin
had
finished
speaking
the
baron
stepped
back
two
or
three
paces
seemed
on
the
point
of
uttering
words
which
he
ended
by
not
saying
and
then
without
taking
his
eyes
from
his
strange
visitor
went
to
the
fireplace
and
rang
the
bell
lupin
did
not
make
a
movement
he
waited
smiling
the
butler
entered
his
master
said
you
can
go
to
bed
antoine
i
will
let
this
gentleman
out
shall
i
put
out
the
lights
sir
leave
a
light
in
the
hall
antoine
left
the
room
and
the
baron
after
taking
a
revolver
from
his
desk
at
once
came
back
to
lupin
put
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
and
said
very
calmly
you
must
excuse
this
little
precaution
sir
i
am
obliged
to
take
it
in
case
you
should
be
mad
though
that
does
not
seem
likely
no
you
are
not
mad
but
you
have
come
here
with
an
object
which
i
fail
to
grasp
and
you
have
sprung
upon
me
an
accusation
of
so
astounding
a
character
that
i
am
curious
to
know
the
reason
i
have
experienced
so
much
disappointment
and
undergone
so
much
suffering
that
an
outrage
of
this
kind
leaves
me
indifferent
continue
please
his
voice
shook
with
emotion
and
his
sad
eyes
seemed
moist
with
tears
lupin
shuddered
had
he
made
a
mistake
was
the
surmise
which
his
intuition
had
suggested
to
him
and
which
was
based
upon
a
frail
groundwork
of
slight
facts
was
this
surmise
wrong
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
detail
through
the
opening
in
the
waistcoat
he
saw
the
point
of
the
pin
fixed
in
the
tie
and
was
thus
able
to
realize
the
unusual
length
of
the
pin
moreover
the
gold
stem
was
triangular
and
formed
a
sort
of
miniature
dagger
very
thin
and
very
delicate
yet
formidable
in
an
expert
hand
and
lupin
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
pin
attached
to
that
magnificent
pearl
was
the
weapon
which
had
pierced
the
heart
of
the
unfortunate
lavernoux
he
muttered
you
jolly
clever
monsieur
le
baron
the
other
maintaining
a
rather
scornful
gravity
kept
silence
as
though
he
did
not
understand
and
as
though
waiting
for
the
explanation
to
which
he
felt
himself
entitled
and
in
spite
of
everything
this
impassive
attitude
worried
arsène
lupin
nevertheless
his
conviction
was
so
profound
and
besides
he
had
staked
so
much
on
the
adventure
that
he
repeated
yes
jolly
clever
for
it
is
evident
that
the
baroness
only
obeyed
your
orders
in
realizing
your
securities
and
also
in
borrowing
the
jewels
on
the
pretence
of
buying
them
and
it
is
evident
that
the
person
who
walked
out
of
your
house
with
a
bag
was
not
your
wife
but
an
accomplice
that
probably
and
that
it
is
your
who
is
deliberately
allowing
herself
to
be
chased
across
the
continent
by
our
worthy
ganimard
and
i
look
upon
the
trick
as
marvellous
what
does
the
woman
risk
seeing
that
it
is
the
baroness
who
is
being
looked
for
and
how
could
they
look
for
any
other
woman
than
the
baroness
seeing
that
you
have
promised
a
reward
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
to
the
person
who
finds
the
baroness
oh
that
two
hundred
thousand
francs
lodged
with
a
solicitor
what
a
stroke
of
genius
it
has
dazzled
the
police
it
has
thrown
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
most
a
gentleman
who
lodges
two
hundred
thousand
francs
with
a
solicitor
is
a
gentleman
who
speaks
the
truth
so
they
go
on
hunting
the
baroness
and
they
leave
you
quietly
to
settle
your
affairs
to
sell
your
stud
and
your
two
houses
to
the
highest
bidder
and
to
prepare
your
flight
heavens
what
a
joke
the
baron
did
not
wince
he
walked
up
to
lupin
and
asked
without
abandoning
his
imperturbable
coolness
who
are
you
lupin
burst
out
laughing
what
can
it
matter
who
i
am
take
it
that
i
am
an
emissary
of
fate
looming
out
of
the
darkness
for
your
destruction
he
sprang
from
his
chair
seized
the
baron
by
the
shoulder
and
jerked
out
yes
for
your
destruction
my
bold
baron
listen
to
me
your
three
millions
almost
all
the
princess
jewels
the
money
you
received
from
the
sale
of
your
stud
and
your
real
estate
it
all
there
in
your
pocket
or
in
that
safe
your
flight
is
prepared
look
i
can
see
the
leather
of
your
portmanteau
behind
that
hanging
the
papers
on
your
desk
are
in
order
this
very
night
you
would
have
done
a
guy
this
very
night
disguised
beyond
recognition
after
taking
all
your
precautions
you
would
have
joined
your
the
creature
for
whose
sake
you
have
committed
murder
that
same
nelly
darbal
no
doubt
whom
ganimard
arrested
in
belgium
but
for
one
sudden
unforeseen
obstacle
the
police
the
twelve
detectives
who
thanks
to
revelations
have
been
posted
under
your
windows
they
cooked
your
goose
old
chap
well
i
save
you
a
word
through
the
telephone
and
by
three
or
four
in
the
morning
twenty
of
my
friends
will
have
removed
the
obstacle
polished
off
the
twelve
detectives
and
you
and
i
will
slip
away
quietly
my
conditions
almost
nothing
a
trifle
to
you
we
share
the
millions
and
the
jewels
is
it
a
bargain
he
was
leaning
over
the
baron
thundering
at
him
with
irresistible
energy
the
baron
whispered
i
beginning
to
understand
it
blackmail
blackmail
or
not
call
it
what
you
please
my
boy
but
you
got
to
go
through
with
it
and
do
as
i
say
and
do
imagine
that
i
shall
give
way
at
the
last
moment
do
say
to
yourself
a
gentleman
whom
the
fear
of
the
police
will
cause
to
think
twice
if
i
run
a
big
risk
in
refusing
he
also
will
be
risking
the
handcuffs
the
cells
and
the
rest
of
it
seeing
that
we
are
both
being
hunted
down
like
wild
beasts
that
would
be
a
mistake
monsieur
le
baron
i
can
always
get
out
of
it
a
question
of
yourself
of
yourself
alone
your
money
or
your
life
my
lord
share
and
share
alike
if
not
the
scaffold
is
it
a
bargain
a
quick
movement
the
baron
released
himself
grasped
his
revolver
and
fired
but
lupin
was
prepared
for
the
attack
the
more
so
as
the
baron
face
had
lost
its
assurance
and
gradually
under
the
slow
impulse
of
rage
and
fear
acquired
an
expression
of
almost
bestial
ferocity
that
heralded
the
rebellion
so
long
kept
under
control
he
fired
twice
lupin
first
flung
himself
to
one
side
and
then
dived
at
the
baron
knees
seized
him
by
both
legs
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
the
baron
freed
himself
with
an
effort
the
two
enemies
rolled
over
in
each
other
grip
and
a
stubborn
crafty
brutal
savage
struggle
followed
suddenly
lupin
felt
a
pain
at
his
chest
you
villain
he
yelled
that
your
lavernoux
trick
the
stiffening
his
muscles
with
a
desperate
effort
he
overpowered
the
baron
and
clutched
him
by
the
throat
victorious
at
last
and
omnipotent
you
ass
he
cried
if
you
had
shown
your
cards
i
might
have
thrown
up
the
game
you
have
such
a
look
of
the
honest
man
about
you
but
what
a
biceps
my
lord
i
thought
for
a
moment
but
it
all
over
now
come
my
friend
hand
us
the
pin
and
look
cheerful
no
that
what
i
call
pulling
a
face
i
holding
you
too
tight
perhaps
my
lord
at
his
last
gasp
come
be
good
that
it
just
a
wee
bit
of
string
round
the
wrists
do
you
allow
me
why
you
and
i
are
agreeing
like
two
brothers
it
touching
at
heart
you
know
i
rather
fond
of
you
and
now
my
bonnie
lad
mind
yourself
and
a
thousand
apologies
half
raising
himself
with
all
his
strength
he
caught
the
other
a
terrible
blow
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
the
baron
gave
a
gurgle
and
lay
stunned
and
unconscious
that
comes
of
having
a
deficient
sense
of
logic
my
friend
said
lupin
i
offered
you
half
your
money
now
i
give
you
none
at
all
provided
i
know
where
to
find
any
of
it
for
that
the
main
thing
where
has
the
beggar
hidden
his
dust
in
the
safe
by
george
it
be
a
tough
job
luckily
i
have
all
the
night
before
me
he
began
to
feel
in
the
baron
pockets
came
upon
a
bunch
of
keys
first
made
sure
that
the
portmanteau
behind
the
curtain
held
no
papers
or
jewels
and
then
went
to
the
safe
but
at
that
moment
he
stopped
short
he
heard
a
noise
somewhere
the
servants
impossible
their
attics
were
on
the
top
floor
he
listened
the
noise
came
from
below
and
suddenly
he
understood
the
detectives
who
had
heard
the
two
shots
were
banging
at
the
front
door
as
was
their
duty
without
waiting
for
daybreak
then
an
electric
bell
rang
which
lupin
recognized
as
that
in
the
hall
by
jupiter
he
said
pretty
work
here
are
these
jokers
coming
and
just
as
we
were
about
to
gather
the
fruits
of
our
laborious
efforts
tut
tut
lupin
keep
cool
what
expected
of
you
to
open
a
safe
of
which
you
do
know
the
secret
in
thirty
seconds
that
a
mere
trifle
to
lose
your
head
about
come
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
discover
the
secret
how
many
letters
are
there
in
the
word
four
he
went
on
thinking
while
talking
and
listening
to
the
noise
outside
he
the
door
of
the
outer
room
and
then
came
back
to
the
safe
four
ciphers
four
letters
four
letters
who
can
lend
me
a
hand
who
can
give
me
just
a
tiny
hint
who
why
lavernoux
of
course
that
good
lavernoux
seeing
that
he
took
the
trouble
to
indulge
in
optical
telegraphy
at
the
risk
of
his
life
lord
what
a
fool
i
am
why
of
course
why
of
course
that
it
by
jove
this
is
too
exciting
lupin
you
must
count
ten
and
suppress
that
distracted
beating
of
your
heart
if
not
it
means
bad
work
he
counted
ten
and
now
quite
calm
knelt
in
front
of
the
safe
he
turned
the
four
knobs
with
careful
attention
next
he
examined
the
bunch
of
keys
selected
one
of
them
then
another
and
attempted
in
vain
to
insert
them
in
the
lock
there
luck
in
odd
numbers
he
muttered
trying
a
third
key
victory
this
is
the
right
one
open
sesame
good
old
sesame
open
the
lock
turned
the
door
moved
on
its
hinges
lupin
pulled
it
to
him
after
taking
out
the
bunch
of
keys
the
millions
are
ours
he
said
baron
i
forgive
you
and
then
he
gave
a
single
bound
backward
hiccoughing
with
fright
his
legs
staggered
beneath
him
the
keys
jingled
together
in
his
fevered
hand
with
a
sinister
sound
and
for
twenty
for
thirty
seconds
despite
the
din
that
was
being
raised
and
the
electric
bells
that
kept
ringing
through
the
house
he
stood
there
gazing
at
the
most
horrible
the
most
abominable
sight
a
woman
body
bent
in
two
in
the
safe
crammed
in
like
an
parcel
and
fair
hair
hanging
down
and
blood
clots
of
blood
and
livid
flesh
blue
in
places
decomposing
flaccid
the
baroness
he
gasped
the
baroness
oh
the
monster
he
roused
himself
from
his
torpor
suddenly
to
spit
in
the
face
and
pound
him
with
his
heels
take
that
you
wretch
take
that
you
villain
and
with
it
the
scaffold
the
meanwhile
shouts
came
from
the
upper
floors
in
reply
to
the
ringing
lupin
heard
footsteps
scurrying
down
the
stairs
it
was
time
to
think
of
beating
a
retreat
in
reality
this
did
not
trouble
him
greatly
during
his
conversation
with
the
baron
the
enemy
extraordinary
coolness
had
given
him
the
feeling
that
there
must
be
a
private
outlet
besides
how
could
the
baron
have
begun
the
fight
if
he
were
not
sure
of
escaping
the
police
lupin
went
into
the
next
room
it
looked
out
on
the
garden
at
the
moment
when
the
detectives
were
entering
the
house
he
flung
his
legs
over
the
balcony
and
let
himself
down
by
a
he
walked
round
the
building
on
the
opposite
side
was
a
wall
lined
with
shrubs
he
slipped
in
between
the
shrubs
and
the
wall
and
at
once
found
a
little
door
which
he
easily
opened
with
one
of
the
keys
on
the
bunch
all
that
remained
for
him
to
do
was
to
walk
across
a
yard
and
pass
through
the
empty
rooms
of
a
lodge
and
in
a
few
moments
he
found
himself
in
the
rue
du
faubourg
of
course
and
this
he
had
reckoned
on
the
police
had
not
provided
for
this
secret
outlet
well
what
do
you
think
of
baron
repstein
cried
lupin
after
giving
me
all
the
details
of
that
tragic
night
what
a
dirty
scoundrel
and
how
it
teaches
one
to
distrust
appearances
i
swear
to
you
the
fellow
looked
a
thoroughly
honest
man
but
what
about
the
millions
i
asked
the
princess
jewels
they
were
in
the
safe
i
remember
seeing
the
parcel
well
they
are
there
still
impossible
they
are
upon
my
word
i
might
tell
you
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
detectives
or
else
plead
a
sudden
attack
of
delicacy
but
the
truth
is
simpler
and
more
prosaic
the
smell
was
too
awful
what
yes
my
dear
fellow
the
smell
that
came
from
that
safe
from
that
coffin
no
i
could
do
it
my
head
swam
another
second
and
i
should
have
been
ill
is
it
silly
look
this
is
all
i
got
from
my
expedition
the
the
value
of
the
pearl
is
thirty
thousand
francs
but
all
the
same
i
feel
jolly
well
annoyed
what
a
sell
one
more
question
i
said
the
word
that
opened
the
safe
well
how
did
you
guess
it
oh
quite
easily
in
fact
i
am
surprised
that
i
did
think
of
it
sooner
well
tell
me
it
was
contained
in
the
revelations
telegraphed
by
that
poor
lavernoux
what
just
think
my
dear
chap
the
mistakes
in
spelling
the
mistakes
in
spelling
why
of
course
they
were
deliberate
surely
you
do
imagine
that
the
agent
the
private
secretary
of
the
baron
who
was
a
mind
you
and
a
did
not
know
english
better
than
to
spell
with
an
with
one
with
two
and
with
an
the
thing
struck
me
at
once
i
put
the
four
letters
together
and
got
the
name
of
the
famous
horse
and
was
that
one
word
enough
of
course
it
was
enough
to
start
with
to
put
me
on
the
scent
of
the
repstein
case
of
which
all
the
papers
were
full
and
next
to
make
me
guess
that
it
was
the
of
the
safe
because
on
the
one
hand
lavernoux
knew
the
gruesome
contents
of
the
safe
and
on
the
other
he
was
denouncing
the
baron
and
it
was
in
the
same
way
that
i
was
led
to
suppose
that
lavernoux
had
a
friend
in
the
street
that
they
both
frequented
the
same
café
that
they
amused
themselves
by
working
out
the
problems
and
cryptograms
in
the
illustrated
papers
and
that
they
had
contrived
a
way
of
exchanging
telegrams
from
window
to
window
that
makes
it
all
quite
simple
i
exclaimed
very
simple
and
the
incident
once
more
shows
that
in
the
discovery
of
crimes
there
is
something
much
more
valuable
than
the
examination
of
facts
than
observations
deductions
inferences
and
all
that
stuff
and
nonsense
what
i
mean
is
as
i
said
before
intuition
intuition
and
intelligence
and
arsène
lupin
without
boasting
is
deficient
in
neither
one
nor
the
other
ii
the
yvonne
kissed
her
son
and
told
him
to
be
good
you
know
your
grandmother
is
not
very
found
of
children
now
that
she
has
sent
for
you
to
come
and
see
her
you
must
show
her
what
a
sensible
little
boy
you
are
and
turning
to
the
governess
forget
fräulein
to
bring
him
home
immediately
after
dinner
is
monsieur
still
in
the
house
yes
madame
monsieur
le
comte
is
in
his
study
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
yvonne
walked
to
the
window
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
son
as
he
left
the
house
he
was
out
in
the
street
in
a
moment
raised
his
head
and
blew
her
a
kiss
as
was
his
custom
every
day
then
the
governess
took
his
hand
with
as
yvonne
remarked
to
her
surprise
a
movement
of
unusual
violence
yvonne
leant
further
out
of
the
window
and
when
the
boy
reached
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
she
suddenly
saw
a
man
step
out
of
a
and
go
up
to
him
the
man
in
whom
she
recognized
bernard
her
husband
confidential
servant
took
the
child
by
the
arm
made
both
him
and
the
governess
get
into
the
car
and
ordered
the
chauffeur
to
drive
off
the
whole
incident
did
not
take
ten
seconds
yvonne
in
her
trepidation
ran
to
her
bedroom
seized
a
wrap
and
went
to
the
door
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
no
key
in
the
lock
she
hurried
back
to
the
boudoir
the
door
of
the
boudoir
also
was
locked
then
suddenly
the
image
of
her
husband
appeared
before
her
that
gloomy
face
which
no
smile
ever
lit
up
those
pitiless
eyes
in
which
for
years
she
had
felt
so
much
hatred
and
malice
it
he
it
he
she
said
to
herself
he
has
taken
the
child
oh
it
horrible
she
beat
against
the
door
with
her
fists
with
her
feet
then
flew
to
the
mantelpiece
and
pressed
the
bell
fiercely
the
shrill
sound
rang
through
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
the
servants
would
be
sure
to
come
perhaps
a
crowd
would
gather
in
the
street
and
impelled
by
a
sort
of
despairing
hope
she
kept
her
finger
on
the
button
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
was
flung
wide
open
the
count
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
boudoir
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
so
terrible
that
yvonne
began
to
tremble
he
entered
the
room
five
or
six
steps
separated
him
from
her
with
a
supreme
effort
she
tried
to
stir
but
all
movement
was
impossible
and
when
she
attempted
to
speak
she
could
only
flutter
her
lips
and
emit
incoherent
sounds
she
felt
herself
lost
the
thought
of
death
unhinged
her
her
knees
gave
way
beneath
her
and
she
sank
into
a
huddled
heap
with
a
moan
the
count
rushed
at
her
and
seized
her
by
the
throat
hold
your
tongue
do
call
out
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
will
be
best
for
you
seeing
that
she
was
not
attempting
to
defend
herself
he
loosened
his
hold
of
her
and
took
from
his
pocket
some
strips
of
canvas
ready
rolled
and
of
different
lengths
in
a
few
minutes
yvonne
was
lying
on
a
sofa
with
her
wrists
and
ankles
bound
and
her
arms
fastened
close
to
her
body
it
was
now
dark
in
the
boudoir
the
count
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
went
to
a
little
where
yvonne
was
accustomed
to
keep
her
letters
not
succeeding
in
opening
it
he
picked
the
lock
with
a
bent
wire
emptied
the
drawers
and
collected
all
the
contents
into
a
bundle
which
he
carried
off
in
a
cardboard
file
waste
of
time
eh
he
grinned
nothing
but
bills
and
letters
of
no
importance
no
proof
against
you
tah
i
keep
my
son
for
all
that
and
i
swear
before
heaven
that
i
will
not
let
him
go
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
he
was
joined
near
the
door
by
his
man
bernard
the
two
stopped
and
talked
in
a
low
voice
but
yvonne
heard
these
words
spoken
by
the
servant
i
have
had
an
answer
from
the
working
jeweller
he
says
he
holds
himself
at
my
disposal
and
the
count
replied
the
thing
is
put
off
until
twelve
midday
my
mother
has
just
telephoned
to
say
that
she
could
not
come
before
then
yvonne
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
the
sound
of
steps
going
down
to
the
where
her
husband
study
was
she
long
lay
inert
her
brain
reeling
with
vague
swift
ideas
that
burnt
her
in
passing
like
flames
she
remembered
her
husband
infamous
behaviour
his
humiliating
conduct
to
her
his
threats
his
plans
for
a
divorce
and
she
gradually
came
to
understand
that
she
was
the
victim
of
a
regular
conspiracy
that
the
servants
had
been
sent
away
until
the
following
evening
by
their
master
orders
that
the
governess
had
carried
off
her
son
by
the
count
instructions
and
with
assistance
that
her
son
would
not
come
back
and
that
she
would
never
see
him
again
my
son
she
cried
my
son
exasperated
by
her
grief
she
stiffened
herself
with
every
nerve
with
every
muscle
tense
to
make
a
violent
effort
and
she
was
astonished
to
find
that
her
right
hand
which
the
count
had
fastened
too
hurriedly
still
retained
a
certain
freedom
then
a
mad
hope
invaded
her
and
slowly
patiently
she
began
the
work
of
it
was
long
in
the
doing
she
needed
a
deal
of
time
to
widen
the
knot
sufficiently
and
a
deal
of
time
afterward
when
the
hand
was
released
to
undo
those
other
bonds
which
tied
her
arms
to
her
body
and
those
which
fastened
her
ankles
still
the
thought
of
her
son
sustained
her
and
the
last
shackle
fell
as
the
clock
struck
eight
she
was
free
she
was
no
sooner
on
her
feet
than
she
flew
to
the
window
and
flung
back
the
latch
with
the
intention
of
calling
the
first
at
that
moment
a
policeman
came
walking
along
the
pavement
she
leant
out
but
the
brisk
evening
air
striking
her
face
calmed
her
she
thought
of
the
scandal
of
the
judicial
investigation
of
the
of
her
son
o
heaven
what
could
she
do
to
get
him
back
how
could
she
escape
the
count
might
appear
at
the
least
sound
and
who
knew
but
that
in
a
moment
of
fury
she
shivered
from
head
to
foot
seized
with
a
sudden
terror
the
horror
of
death
mingled
in
her
poor
brain
with
the
thought
of
her
son
and
she
stammered
with
a
choking
throat
help
help
she
stopped
and
said
to
herself
several
times
over
in
a
low
voice
help
help
as
though
the
word
awakened
an
idea
a
memory
within
her
and
as
though
the
hope
of
assistance
no
longer
seemed
to
her
impossible
for
some
minutes
she
remained
absorbed
in
deep
meditation
broken
by
fears
and
starts
then
with
an
almost
mechanical
series
of
movements
she
put
out
her
arm
to
a
little
set
of
shelves
hanging
over
the
took
down
four
books
one
after
the
other
turned
the
pages
with
a
distraught
air
replaced
them
and
ended
by
finding
between
the
pages
of
the
fifth
a
on
which
her
eyes
spelt
the
name
horace
velmont
followed
by
an
address
written
in
pencil
cercle
de
la
rue
royale
and
her
memory
conjured
up
the
strange
thing
which
that
man
had
said
to
her
a
few
years
before
in
that
same
house
on
a
day
when
she
was
at
home
to
her
friends
if
ever
a
danger
threatens
you
if
you
need
help
do
not
hesitate
post
this
card
which
you
see
me
put
into
this
book
and
whatever
the
hour
whatever
the
obstacles
i
will
come
with
what
a
curious
air
he
had
spoken
these
words
and
how
well
he
had
conveyed
the
impression
of
certainty
of
strength
of
unlimited
power
of
indomitable
daring
abruptly
unconsciously
acting
under
the
impulse
of
an
irresistible
determination
the
consequences
of
which
she
refused
to
anticipate
yvonne
with
the
same
automatic
gestures
took
a
envelope
slipped
in
the
card
sealed
it
directed
it
to
horace
velmont
cercle
de
la
rue
royale
and
went
to
the
open
window
the
policeman
was
walking
up
and
down
outside
she
flung
out
the
envelope
trusting
to
fate
perhaps
it
would
be
picked
up
treated
as
a
lost
letter
and
posted
she
had
hardly
completed
this
act
when
she
realized
its
absurdity
it
was
mad
to
suppose
that
the
message
would
reach
the
address
and
madder
still
to
hope
that
the
man
to
whom
she
was
sending
could
come
to
her
assistance
whatever
the
hour
whatever
the
obstacles
a
reaction
followed
which
was
all
the
greater
inasmuch
as
the
effort
had
been
swift
and
violent
yvonne
staggered
leant
against
a
chair
and
losing
all
energy
let
herself
fall
the
hours
passed
by
the
dreary
hours
of
winter
evenings
when
nothing
but
the
sound
of
carriages
interrupts
the
silence
of
the
street
the
clock
struck
pitilessly
in
the
that
numbed
her
limbs
yvonne
counted
the
strokes
she
also
heard
certain
noises
on
different
floors
of
the
house
which
told
her
that
her
husband
had
dined
that
he
was
going
up
to
his
room
that
he
was
going
down
again
to
his
study
but
all
this
seemed
very
shadowy
to
her
and
her
torpor
was
such
that
she
did
not
even
think
of
lying
down
on
the
sofa
in
case
he
should
come
in
the
twelve
strokes
of
midnight
then
twelve
then
one
yvonne
thought
of
nothing
awaiting
the
events
which
were
preparing
and
against
which
rebellion
was
useless
she
pictured
her
son
and
herself
as
one
pictures
those
beings
who
have
suffered
much
and
who
suffer
no
more
and
who
take
each
other
in
their
loving
arms
but
a
nightmare
shattered
this
dream
for
now
those
two
beings
were
to
be
torn
asunder
and
she
had
the
awful
feeling
in
her
delirium
that
she
was
crying
and
choking
she
leapt
from
her
seat
the
key
had
turned
in
the
lock
the
count
was
coming
attracted
by
her
cries
yvonne
glanced
round
for
a
weapon
with
which
to
defend
herself
but
the
door
was
pushed
back
quickly
and
astounded
as
though
the
sight
that
presented
itself
before
her
eyes
seemed
to
her
the
most
inexplicable
prodigy
she
stammered
you
you
a
man
was
walking
up
to
her
in
with
his
and
cape
under
his
arm
and
this
man
young
slender
and
elegant
she
had
recognized
as
horace
velmont
you
she
repeated
he
said
with
a
bow
i
beg
your
pardon
madame
but
i
did
not
receive
your
letter
until
very
late
is
it
possible
is
it
possible
that
this
is
you
that
you
were
able
to
he
seemed
greatly
surprised
did
i
not
promise
to
come
in
answer
to
your
call
yes
but
well
here
i
am
he
said
with
a
smile
he
examined
the
strips
of
canvas
from
which
yvonne
had
succeeded
in
freeing
herself
and
nodded
his
head
while
continuing
his
inspection
so
those
are
the
means
employed
the
comte
i
presume
i
also
saw
that
he
locked
you
in
but
then
the
pneumatic
letter
ah
through
the
window
how
careless
of
you
not
to
close
it
he
pushed
both
sides
to
yvonne
took
fright
suppose
they
hear
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
i
have
been
over
it
still
your
husband
went
out
ten
minutes
ago
where
is
he
with
his
mother
the
comtesse
how
do
you
know
oh
it
very
simple
he
was
rung
up
by
telephone
and
i
awaited
the
result
at
the
corner
of
this
street
and
the
boulevard
as
i
expected
the
count
came
out
hurriedly
followed
by
his
man
i
at
once
entered
with
the
aid
of
special
keys
he
told
this
in
the
most
natural
way
just
as
one
tells
a
meaningless
anecdote
in
a
but
yvonne
suddenly
seized
with
fresh
alarm
asked
then
it
not
true
his
mother
is
not
ill
in
that
case
my
husband
will
be
coming
back
certainly
the
count
will
see
that
a
trick
has
been
played
on
him
and
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
at
the
latest
let
us
go
i
do
want
him
to
find
me
here
i
must
go
to
my
son
one
moment
one
moment
but
do
you
know
that
they
have
taken
him
from
me
that
they
are
hurting
him
perhaps
with
set
face
and
feverish
gestures
she
tried
to
push
velmont
back
he
with
great
gentleness
compelled
her
to
sit
down
and
leaning
over
her
in
a
respectful
attitude
said
in
a
serious
voice
listen
madame
and
let
us
not
waste
time
when
every
minute
is
valuable
first
of
all
remember
this
we
met
four
times
six
years
ago
and
on
the
fourth
occasion
when
i
was
speaking
to
you
in
the
of
this
house
with
too
much
what
shall
i
say
with
too
much
feeling
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
my
visits
were
no
longer
welcome
since
that
day
i
have
not
seen
you
and
nevertheless
in
spite
of
all
your
faith
in
me
was
such
that
you
kept
the
card
which
i
put
between
the
pages
of
that
book
and
six
years
later
you
send
for
me
and
none
other
that
faith
in
me
i
ask
you
to
continue
you
must
obey
me
blindly
just
as
i
surmounted
every
obstacle
to
come
to
you
so
i
will
save
you
whatever
the
position
may
be
horace
velmont
calmness
his
masterful
voice
with
the
friendly
intonation
gradually
quieted
the
countess
though
still
very
weak
she
gained
a
fresh
sense
of
ease
and
security
in
that
man
presence
have
no
fear
he
went
on
the
comtesse
lives
at
the
other
end
of
the
bois
de
vincennes
allowing
that
your
husband
finds
a
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
be
back
before
a
three
well
it
is
to
three
now
i
swear
to
take
you
away
at
three
exactly
and
to
take
you
to
your
son
but
i
will
not
go
before
i
know
everything
what
am
i
to
do
she
asked
answer
me
and
very
plainly
we
have
twenty
minutes
it
is
enough
but
it
is
not
too
much
ask
me
what
you
want
to
know
do
you
think
that
the
count
had
any
any
murderous
intentions
no
then
it
concerns
your
son
yes
he
is
taking
him
away
i
suppose
because
he
wants
to
divorce
you
and
marry
another
woman
a
former
friend
of
yours
whom
you
have
turned
out
of
your
house
is
that
it
oh
i
entreat
you
answer
me
frankly
these
are
facts
of
public
notoriety
and
your
hesitation
your
scruples
must
all
cease
now
that
the
matter
concerns
your
son
so
your
husband
wished
to
marry
another
woman
yes
the
woman
has
no
money
your
husband
on
his
side
has
gambled
away
all
his
property
and
has
no
means
beyond
the
allowance
which
he
receives
from
his
mother
the
comtesse
and
the
income
of
a
large
fortune
which
your
son
inherited
from
two
of
your
uncles
it
is
this
fortune
which
your
husband
covets
and
which
he
would
appropriate
more
easily
if
the
child
were
placed
in
his
hands
there
is
only
one
way
divorce
am
i
right
yes
and
what
has
prevented
him
until
now
is
your
refusal
yes
mine
and
that
of
my
whose
religious
feelings
are
opposed
to
divorce
the
comtesse
would
only
yield
in
case
in
case
in
case
they
could
prove
me
guilty
of
shameful
conduct
velmont
shrugged
his
shoulders
therefore
he
is
powerless
to
do
anything
against
you
or
against
your
son
both
from
the
legal
point
of
view
and
from
that
of
his
own
interests
he
stumbles
against
an
obstacle
which
is
the
most
insurmountable
of
all
the
virtue
of
an
honest
woman
and
yet
in
spite
of
everything
he
suddenly
shows
fight
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
if
a
man
like
the
count
after
so
many
hesitations
and
in
the
face
of
so
many
difficulties
risks
so
doubtful
an
adventure
it
must
be
because
he
thinks
he
has
command
of
weapons
what
weapons
i
do
know
but
they
exist
or
else
he
would
not
have
begun
by
taking
away
your
son
yvonne
gave
way
to
her
despair
oh
this
is
horrible
how
do
i
know
what
he
may
have
done
what
he
may
have
invented
try
and
think
recall
your
memories
tell
me
in
this
desk
which
he
has
broken
open
was
there
any
sort
of
letter
which
he
could
possibly
turn
against
you
no
only
bills
and
addresses
and
in
the
words
he
used
to
you
in
his
threats
is
there
nothing
that
allows
you
to
guess
nothing
still
still
velmont
insisted
there
must
be
something
and
he
continued
has
the
count
a
particularly
intimate
friend
in
whom
he
confides
no
did
anybody
come
to
see
him
yesterday
no
nobody
was
he
alone
when
he
bound
you
and
locked
you
in
at
that
moment
yes
but
afterward
his
man
bernard
joined
him
near
the
door
and
i
heard
them
talking
about
a
working
jeweller
is
that
all
and
about
something
that
was
to
happen
the
next
day
that
is
at
twelve
because
the
comtesse
could
not
come
earlier
velmont
reflected
has
that
conversation
any
meaning
that
throws
a
light
upon
your
husband
plans
i
do
see
any
where
are
your
jewels
my
husband
has
sold
them
all
you
have
nothing
at
all
left
no
not
even
a
ring
no
she
said
showing
her
hands
none
except
this
which
is
your
which
is
my
wedding
she
stopped
nonplussed
velmont
saw
her
flush
as
she
stammered
could
it
be
possible
but
no
no
he
does
know
velmont
at
once
pressed
her
with
questions
and
yvonne
stood
silent
motionless
at
last
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
this
is
not
my
one
day
long
ago
it
dropped
from
the
mantelpiece
in
my
bedroom
where
i
had
put
it
a
minute
before
and
hunt
for
it
as
i
might
i
could
not
find
it
again
so
i
ordered
another
without
saying
anything
about
it
and
this
is
the
one
on
my
hand
did
the
real
ring
bear
the
date
of
your
wedding
yes
the
of
october
and
the
second
this
one
has
no
date
he
perceived
a
slight
hesitation
in
her
and
a
confusion
which
in
point
of
fact
she
did
not
try
to
conceal
i
implore
you
he
exclaimed
do
hide
anything
from
me
you
see
how
far
we
have
gone
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
little
logic
and
calmness
let
us
go
on
i
ask
you
as
a
favour
are
you
sure
she
said
that
it
is
necessary
i
am
sure
that
the
least
detail
is
of
importance
and
that
we
are
nearly
attaining
our
object
but
we
must
hurry
this
is
a
crucial
moment
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
she
said
proudly
raising
her
head
it
was
the
most
wretched
and
the
most
dangerous
period
of
my
life
while
suffering
humiliation
at
home
outside
i
was
surrounded
with
attentions
with
temptations
with
pitfalls
like
any
woman
who
is
seen
to
be
neglected
by
her
husband
then
i
remembered
before
my
marriage
a
man
had
been
in
love
with
me
i
had
guessed
his
unspoken
love
and
he
has
died
since
i
had
the
name
of
that
man
engraved
inside
the
ring
and
i
wore
it
as
a
talisman
there
was
no
love
in
me
because
i
was
the
wife
of
another
but
in
my
secret
heart
there
was
a
memory
a
sad
dream
something
sweet
and
gentle
that
protected
me
she
had
spoken
slowly
without
embarrassment
and
velmont
did
not
doubt
for
a
second
that
she
was
telling
the
absolute
truth
he
kept
silent
and
she
becoming
anxious
again
asked
do
you
suppose
that
my
husband
he
took
her
hand
and
while
examining
the
plain
gold
ring
said
the
puzzle
lies
here
your
husband
i
do
know
how
knows
of
the
substitution
of
one
ring
for
the
other
his
mother
will
be
here
at
twelve
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
he
will
compel
you
to
take
off
your
ring
and
in
this
way
he
will
obtain
the
approval
of
his
mother
and
at
the
same
time
will
be
able
to
obtain
his
divorce
because
he
will
have
the
proof
for
which
he
was
seeking
i
am
lost
she
moaned
i
am
lost
on
the
contrary
you
are
saved
give
me
that
ring
and
presently
he
will
find
another
there
another
which
i
will
send
you
to
reach
you
before
twelve
and
which
will
bear
the
date
of
the
of
october
so
he
suddenly
broke
off
while
he
was
speaking
yvonne
hand
had
turned
in
his
and
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
that
the
young
woman
was
pale
terribly
pale
what
the
matter
i
beseech
you
she
yielded
to
a
fit
of
mad
despair
this
is
the
matter
that
i
am
lost
this
is
the
matter
that
i
get
the
ring
off
it
has
grown
too
small
for
me
do
you
understand
it
made
no
difference
and
i
did
not
give
it
a
thought
but
this
proof
this
accusation
oh
what
torture
look
it
forms
part
of
my
finger
it
has
grown
into
my
flesh
and
i
ca
i
ca
she
pulled
at
the
ring
vainly
with
all
her
might
at
the
risk
of
injuring
herself
but
the
flesh
swelled
up
around
the
ring
and
the
ring
did
not
budge
oh
she
cried
seized
with
an
idea
that
terrified
her
i
remember
the
other
night
a
nightmare
i
had
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
one
entered
my
room
and
caught
hold
of
my
hand
and
i
could
not
wake
up
it
was
he
it
was
he
he
had
put
me
to
sleep
i
was
sure
of
it
and
he
was
looking
at
the
ring
and
presently
he
will
pull
it
off
before
his
mother
eyes
ah
i
understand
everything
that
working
jeweller
he
will
cut
it
from
my
hand
you
see
you
see
i
am
lost
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to
weep
but
amid
the
silence
the
clock
struck
once
and
twice
and
yet
once
more
and
yvonne
drew
herself
up
with
a
jerk
there
he
is
she
cried
he
is
coming
it
is
three
let
us
go
she
grabbed
at
her
cloak
and
ran
to
the
door
velmont
barred
the
way
and
in
a
masterful
tone
you
shall
not
go
my
son
i
want
to
see
him
to
take
him
back
you
do
even
know
where
he
is
i
want
to
go
you
shall
not
go
it
would
be
madness
he
took
her
by
the
wrists
she
tried
to
release
herself
and
velmont
had
to
employ
a
little
force
to
overcome
her
resistance
in
the
end
he
succeeded
in
getting
her
back
to
the
sofa
then
in
laying
her
at
full
length
and
at
once
without
heeding
her
lamentations
he
took
the
canvas
strips
and
fastened
her
wrists
and
ankles
yes
he
said
it
would
be
madness
who
would
have
set
you
free
who
would
have
opened
that
door
for
you
an
accomplice
what
an
argument
against
you
and
what
a
pretty
use
your
husband
would
make
of
it
with
his
mother
and
besides
what
the
good
to
run
away
means
accepting
divorce
and
what
might
that
not
lead
to
you
must
stay
here
she
sobbed
i
frightened
i
frightened
this
ring
burns
me
break
it
take
it
away
do
let
him
find
it
and
if
it
is
not
found
on
your
finger
who
will
have
broken
it
again
an
accomplice
no
you
must
face
the
music
and
face
it
boldly
for
i
answer
for
everything
believe
me
i
answer
for
everything
if
i
have
to
tackle
the
comtesse
bodily
and
thus
delay
the
interview
if
i
had
to
come
myself
before
noon
it
is
the
real
that
shall
be
taken
from
your
finger
that
i
swear
and
your
son
shall
be
restored
to
you
swayed
and
subdued
yvonne
instinctively
held
out
her
hands
to
the
bonds
when
he
stood
up
she
was
bound
as
she
had
been
before
he
looked
round
the
room
to
make
sure
that
no
trace
of
his
visit
remained
then
he
stooped
over
the
countess
again
and
whispered
think
of
your
son
and
whatever
happens
fear
nothing
i
am
watching
over
you
she
heard
him
open
and
shut
the
door
of
the
boudoir
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
at
three
a
drew
up
the
door
downstairs
was
slammed
again
and
almost
immediately
after
yvonne
saw
her
husband
hurry
in
with
a
furious
look
in
his
eyes
he
ran
up
to
her
felt
to
see
if
she
was
still
fastened
and
snatching
her
hand
examined
the
ring
yvonne
fainted
she
could
not
tell
when
she
woke
how
long
she
had
slept
but
the
broad
light
of
day
was
filling
the
boudoir
and
she
perceived
at
the
first
movement
which
she
made
that
her
bonds
were
cut
then
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
her
husband
standing
beside
her
looking
at
her
my
son
my
son
she
moaned
i
want
my
son
he
replied
in
a
voice
of
which
she
felt
the
jeering
insolence
our
son
is
in
a
safe
place
and
for
the
moment
it
a
question
not
of
him
but
of
you
we
are
face
to
face
with
each
other
probably
for
the
last
time
and
the
explanation
between
us
will
be
a
very
serious
one
i
must
warn
you
that
it
will
take
place
before
my
mother
have
you
any
objection
yvonne
tried
to
hide
her
agitation
and
answered
none
at
all
can
i
send
for
her
yes
leave
me
in
the
meantime
i
shall
be
ready
when
she
comes
my
mother
is
here
your
mother
is
here
cried
yvonne
in
dismay
remembering
horace
velmont
promise
what
is
there
to
astonish
you
in
that
and
is
it
now
is
it
at
once
that
you
want
to
yes
why
why
not
this
evening
why
not
and
now
declared
the
count
a
rather
curious
incident
happened
in
the
course
of
last
night
an
incident
which
i
can
not
account
for
and
which
decided
me
to
hasten
the
explanation
do
you
want
something
to
eat
first
no
no
then
i
will
go
and
fetch
my
mother
he
turned
to
yvonne
bedroom
yvonne
glanced
at
the
clock
it
marked
minutes
to
eleven
ah
she
said
with
a
shiver
of
fright
minutes
to
eleven
horace
velmont
would
not
save
her
and
nobody
in
the
world
and
nothing
in
the
world
would
save
her
for
there
was
no
miracle
that
could
place
the
upon
her
finger
the
count
returning
with
the
comtesse
asked
her
to
sit
down
she
was
a
tall
lank
angular
woman
who
had
always
displayed
a
hostile
feeling
to
yvonne
she
did
not
even
bid
her
showing
that
her
mind
was
made
up
as
regards
the
accusation
i
do
think
she
said
that
we
need
speak
at
length
in
two
words
my
son
maintains
i
do
maintain
mother
said
the
count
i
declare
i
declare
on
my
oath
that
three
months
ago
during
the
holidays
the
upholsterer
when
laying
the
carpet
in
this
room
and
the
boudoir
found
the
which
i
gave
my
wife
lying
in
a
crack
in
the
floor
here
is
the
ring
the
date
of
the
of
october
is
engraved
inside
then
said
the
countess
the
ring
which
your
wife
carries
that
is
another
ring
which
she
ordered
in
exchange
for
the
real
one
acting
on
my
instructions
bernard
my
man
after
long
searching
ended
by
discovering
in
the
outskirts
of
paris
where
he
now
lives
the
little
jeweller
to
whom
she
went
this
man
remembers
perfectly
and
is
willing
to
bear
witness
that
his
customer
did
not
tell
him
to
engrave
a
date
but
a
name
he
has
forgotten
the
name
but
the
man
who
used
to
work
with
him
in
his
shop
may
be
able
to
remember
it
this
working
jeweller
has
been
informed
by
letter
that
i
required
his
services
and
he
replied
yesterday
placing
himself
at
my
disposal
bernard
went
to
fetch
him
at
nine
this
morning
they
are
both
waiting
in
my
study
he
turned
to
his
wife
will
you
give
me
that
ring
of
your
own
free
will
you
know
she
said
from
the
other
night
that
it
wo
come
off
my
finger
in
that
case
can
i
have
the
man
up
he
has
the
necessary
implements
with
him
yes
she
said
in
a
voice
faint
as
a
whisper
she
was
resigned
she
conjured
up
the
future
as
in
a
vision
the
scandal
the
decree
of
divorce
pronounced
against
herself
the
custody
of
the
child
awarded
to
the
father
and
she
accepted
this
thinking
that
she
would
carry
off
her
son
that
she
would
go
with
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
that
the
two
of
them
would
live
alone
together
and
happy
her
said
you
have
been
very
thoughtless
yvonne
yvonne
was
on
the
point
of
confessing
to
her
and
asking
for
her
protection
but
what
was
the
good
how
could
the
comtesse
possibly
believe
her
innocent
she
made
no
reply
besides
the
count
at
once
returned
followed
by
his
servant
and
by
a
man
carrying
a
bag
of
tools
under
his
arm
and
the
count
said
to
the
man
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
yes
said
the
workman
it
to
cut
a
ring
that
grown
too
small
that
easily
done
a
touch
of
the
nippers
and
then
you
will
see
said
the
count
if
the
inscription
inside
the
ring
was
the
one
you
engraved
yvonne
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
ten
minutes
to
eleven
she
seemed
to
hear
somewhere
in
the
house
a
sound
of
voices
raised
in
argument
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
felt
a
thrill
of
hope
perhaps
velmont
has
succeeded
but
the
sound
was
renewed
and
she
perceived
that
it
was
produced
by
some
costermongers
passing
under
her
window
and
moving
farther
on
it
was
all
over
horace
velmont
had
been
unable
to
assist
her
and
she
understood
that
to
recover
her
child
she
must
rely
upon
her
own
strength
for
the
promises
of
others
are
vain
she
made
a
movement
of
recoil
she
had
felt
the
workman
heavy
hand
on
her
hand
and
that
hateful
touch
revolted
her
the
man
apologized
awkwardly
the
count
said
to
his
wife
you
must
make
up
your
mind
you
know
then
she
put
out
her
slim
and
trembling
hand
to
the
workman
who
took
it
turned
it
over
and
rested
it
on
the
table
with
the
palm
upward
yvonne
felt
the
cold
steel
she
longed
to
die
then
and
there
and
at
once
attracted
by
that
idea
of
death
she
thought
of
the
poisons
which
she
would
buy
and
which
would
send
her
to
sleep
almost
without
her
knowing
it
the
operation
did
not
take
long
inserted
on
the
slant
the
little
steel
pliers
pushed
back
the
flesh
made
room
for
themselves
and
bit
the
ring
a
strong
effort
and
the
ring
broke
the
two
ends
had
only
to
be
separated
to
remove
the
ring
from
the
finger
the
workman
did
so
the
count
exclaimed
in
triumph
at
last
now
we
shall
see
the
proof
is
there
and
we
are
all
witnesses
he
snatched
up
the
ring
and
looked
at
the
inscription
a
cry
of
amazement
escaped
him
the
ring
bore
the
date
of
his
marriage
to
yvonne
of
october
we
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
at
monte
carlo
lupin
finished
his
story
lit
a
cigarette
and
calmly
puffed
the
smoke
into
the
blue
air
i
said
well
well
what
why
the
end
of
the
story
the
end
of
the
story
but
what
other
end
could
there
be
come
you
joking
not
at
all
is
that
enough
for
you
the
countess
is
saved
the
count
not
possessing
the
least
proof
against
her
is
compelled
by
his
mother
to
forego
the
divorce
and
to
give
up
the
child
that
is
all
since
then
he
has
left
his
wife
who
is
living
happily
with
her
son
a
fine
lad
of
sixteen
yes
yes
but
the
way
in
which
the
countess
was
saved
lupin
burst
out
laughing
my
dear
old
chap
lupin
sometimes
condescends
to
address
me
in
this
affectionate
manner
my
dear
old
chap
you
may
be
rather
smart
at
relating
my
exploits
but
by
jove
you
do
want
to
have
the
i
dotted
for
you
i
assure
you
the
countess
did
not
ask
for
explanations
very
likely
but
there
no
pride
about
me
i
added
laughing
dot
those
i
for
me
will
you
he
took
out
a
piece
and
closed
his
hand
over
it
what
in
my
hand
a
piece
he
opened
his
hand
the
piece
was
gone
you
see
how
easy
it
is
a
working
jeweller
with
his
nippers
cuts
a
ring
with
a
date
engraved
upon
it
of
october
it
a
simple
little
trick
of
one
of
many
which
i
have
in
my
bag
by
jove
i
did
spend
six
months
with
dickson
the
conjurer
c
for
nothing
c
exploits
of
arsène
by
maurice
leblanc
translated
by
alexander
teixeira
de
mattos
cassell
iv
escape
of
arsène
but
then
out
with
it
the
working
jeweller
was
horace
velmont
was
good
old
lupin
leaving
the
countess
at
three
in
the
morning
i
employed
the
few
remaining
minutes
before
the
husband
return
to
have
a
look
round
his
study
on
the
table
i
found
the
letter
from
the
working
jeweller
the
letter
gave
me
the
address
a
bribe
of
a
few
louis
enabled
me
to
take
the
workman
place
and
i
arrived
with
a
ready
cut
and
engraved
pass
the
count
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
splendid
i
cried
and
i
added
a
little
chaffingly
in
my
turn
but
do
you
think
that
you
were
humbugged
a
bit
yourself
on
this
occasion
oh
and
by
whom
pray
by
the
countess
in
what
way
hang
it
all
that
name
engraved
as
a
talisman
the
mysterious
adonis
who
loved
her
and
suffered
for
her
sake
all
that
story
seems
very
unlikely
and
i
wonder
whether
lupin
though
you
be
you
did
not
just
drop
upon
a
pretty
absolutely
genuine
and
none
too
innocent
lupin
looked
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
no
he
said
how
do
you
know
if
the
countess
made
a
misstatement
in
telling
me
that
she
knew
that
man
before
her
marriage
and
that
he
was
dead
and
if
she
really
did
love
him
in
her
secret
heart
i
at
least
have
a
positive
proof
that
it
was
an
ideal
love
and
that
he
did
not
suspect
it
and
where
is
the
proof
it
is
inscribed
inside
the
ring
which
i
myself
broke
on
the
finger
and
which
i
carry
on
me
here
it
is
you
can
read
the
name
she
had
engraved
on
it
he
handed
me
the
ring
i
read
horace
velmont
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
between
lupin
and
myself
and
noticing
it
i
also
observed
on
his
face
a
certain
emotion
a
tinge
of
melancholy
i
resumed
what
made
you
tell
me
this
story
to
which
you
have
often
alluded
in
my
presence
what
made
me
he
drew
my
attention
to
a
woman
still
exceedingly
handsome
who
was
passing
on
a
young
man
arm
she
saw
lupin
and
bowed
it
she
he
whispered
she
and
her
son
then
she
recognized
you
she
always
recognizes
me
whatever
my
disguise
but
since
the
burglary
at
the
château
de
thibermesnil
d
the
police
have
identified
the
two
names
of
arsène
lupin
and
horace
velmont
d
exploits
of
arsène
lupin
ix
holmlock
shears
arrives
too
yes
therefore
she
knows
who
you
are
yes
and
she
bows
to
you
i
exclaimed
in
spite
of
myself
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
fiercely
do
you
think
that
i
am
lupin
to
her
do
you
think
that
i
am
a
burglar
in
her
eyes
a
rogue
a
cheat
why
i
might
be
the
lowest
of
miscreants
i
might
be
a
murderer
even
and
still
she
would
bow
to
me
why
because
she
loved
you
once
rot
that
would
be
an
additional
reason
on
the
contrary
why
she
should
now
despise
me
what
then
i
am
the
man
who
gave
her
back
her
son
iii
the
sign
of
the
shadow
i
received
your
telegram
and
here
i
am
said
a
gentleman
with
a
grey
moustache
who
entered
my
study
dressed
in
a
and
a
hat
with
a
red
ribbon
in
his
buttonhole
what
the
matter
had
i
not
been
expecting
arsène
lupin
i
should
certainly
never
have
recognized
him
in
the
person
of
this
old
officer
what
the
matter
i
echoed
oh
nothing
much
a
rather
curious
coincidence
that
all
and
as
i
know
that
you
would
just
as
soon
clear
up
a
mystery
as
plan
one
well
you
seem
in
a
great
hurry
i
am
unless
the
mystery
in
question
is
worth
putting
myself
out
for
so
let
us
get
to
the
point
very
well
just
begin
by
casting
your
eye
on
this
little
picture
which
i
picked
up
a
week
or
two
ago
in
a
grimy
old
shop
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
bought
it
for
the
sake
of
its
empire
frame
with
the
ornaments
on
the
mouldings
for
the
painting
is
execrable
execrable
as
you
say
said
lupin
after
he
had
examined
it
but
the
subject
itself
is
rather
nice
that
corner
of
an
old
courtyard
with
its
rotunda
of
greek
columns
its
and
its
and
that
ruined
well
with
the
renascence
roof
and
those
stone
steps
and
stone
benches
all
very
picturesque
and
genuine
i
added
the
picture
good
or
bad
has
never
been
taken
out
of
its
empire
frame
besides
it
is
dated
there
in
the
bottom
corner
those
red
figures
which
obviously
stand
for
april
i
dare
say
i
dare
say
but
you
were
speaking
of
a
coincidence
and
so
far
i
fail
to
see
i
went
to
a
corner
of
my
study
took
a
telescope
fixed
it
on
its
stand
and
pointed
it
through
the
open
window
at
the
open
window
of
a
little
room
facing
my
flat
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
i
asked
lupin
to
look
through
it
he
stooped
forward
the
slanting
rays
of
the
morning
sun
lit
up
the
room
opposite
revealing
a
set
of
mahogany
furniture
all
very
simple
a
large
bed
and
a
child
bed
hung
with
cretonne
curtains
ah
cried
lupin
suddenly
the
same
picture
exactly
the
same
i
said
and
the
date
do
you
see
the
date
in
red
yes
i
see
and
who
lives
in
that
room
a
lady
or
rather
a
workwoman
for
she
has
to
work
for
her
living
needlework
hardly
enough
to
keep
herself
and
her
child
what
is
her
name
louise
from
what
i
hear
she
is
the
of
a
who
was
guillotined
during
the
terror
yes
on
the
same
day
as
andré
chénier
said
lupin
according
to
the
memoirs
of
the
time
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
very
rich
man
he
raised
his
head
and
said
it
an
interesting
story
why
did
you
wait
before
telling
me
because
this
is
the
of
april
well
well
i
discovered
yesterday
i
heard
them
talking
about
it
in
the
porter
box
that
the
of
april
plays
an
important
part
in
the
life
of
louise
nonsense
contrary
to
her
usual
habits
this
woman
who
works
every
day
of
her
life
who
keeps
her
two
rooms
tidy
who
cooks
the
lunch
which
her
little
girl
eats
when
she
comes
home
from
the
parish
school
this
woman
on
the
of
april
goes
out
with
the
child
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
does
not
return
until
nightfall
and
this
has
happened
for
years
and
in
all
weathers
you
must
admit
that
there
is
something
queer
about
this
date
which
i
find
on
an
old
picture
which
is
inscribed
on
another
similar
picture
and
which
controls
the
annual
movements
of
the
descendant
of
the
yes
it
curious
you
quite
right
said
lupin
slowly
and
do
you
know
where
she
goes
to
nobody
knows
she
does
not
confide
in
a
soul
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
talks
very
little
are
you
sure
of
your
information
absolutely
and
the
best
proof
of
its
accuracy
is
that
here
she
comes
a
door
had
opened
at
the
back
of
the
room
opposite
admitting
a
little
girl
of
seven
or
eight
who
came
and
looked
out
of
the
window
a
lady
appeared
behind
her
tall
still
and
wearing
a
sad
and
gentle
air
both
of
them
were
ready
and
dressed
in
clothes
which
were
simple
in
themselves
but
which
pointed
to
a
love
of
neatness
and
a
certain
elegance
on
the
part
of
the
mother
you
see
i
whispered
they
are
going
out
and
presently
the
mother
took
the
child
by
the
hand
and
they
left
the
room
together
lupin
caught
up
his
hat
are
you
coming
my
curiosity
was
too
great
for
me
to
raise
the
least
objection
i
went
downstairs
with
lupin
as
we
stepped
into
the
street
we
saw
my
neighbour
enter
a
baker
shop
she
bought
two
rolls
and
placed
them
in
a
little
basket
which
her
daughter
was
carrying
and
which
seemed
already
to
contain
some
other
provisions
then
they
went
in
the
direction
of
the
outer
boulevards
and
followed
them
as
far
as
the
place
de
where
they
turned
down
the
avenue
kléber
to
walk
toward
passy
lupin
strolled
silently
along
evidently
obsessed
by
a
train
of
thought
which
i
was
glad
to
have
provoked
from
time
to
time
he
uttered
a
sentence
which
showed
me
the
thread
of
his
reflections
and
i
was
able
to
see
that
the
riddle
remained
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
to
myself
louise
meanwhile
had
branched
off
to
the
left
along
the
rue
raynouard
a
quiet
old
street
in
which
franklin
and
balzac
once
lived
one
of
those
streets
which
lined
with
houses
and
walled
gardens
give
you
the
impression
of
being
in
a
the
seine
flows
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
which
the
street
crowns
and
a
number
of
lanes
run
down
to
the
river
my
neighbour
took
one
of
these
narrow
winding
deserted
lanes
the
first
building
on
the
right
was
a
house
the
front
of
which
faced
the
rue
raynouard
next
came
a
wall
of
a
height
above
the
ordinary
supported
by
buttresses
and
bristling
with
broken
glass
along
the
wall
was
a
low
arched
door
louise
stopped
in
front
of
this
door
and
opened
it
with
a
key
which
seemed
to
us
enormous
mother
and
child
entered
and
closed
the
door
in
any
case
said
lupin
she
has
nothing
to
conceal
for
she
has
not
looked
round
once
he
had
hardly
finished
his
sentence
when
we
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
behind
us
it
was
two
old
beggars
a
man
and
a
woman
tattered
dirty
squalid
covered
in
rags
they
passed
us
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
our
presence
the
man
took
from
his
wallet
a
key
similar
to
my
neighbour
and
put
it
into
the
lock
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
suddenly
at
the
top
of
the
lane
came
the
noise
of
a
stopping
lupin
dragged
me
fifty
yards
lower
down
to
a
corner
in
which
we
were
able
to
hide
and
we
saw
coming
down
the
lane
carrying
a
little
dog
under
her
arm
a
young
and
very
much
woman
wearing
a
quantity
of
jewellery
a
young
woman
whose
eyes
were
too
dark
her
lips
too
red
her
hair
too
fair
in
front
of
the
door
the
same
performance
with
the
same
key
the
lady
and
the
dog
disappeared
from
view
this
promises
to
be
most
amusing
said
lupin
chuckling
what
earthly
connection
can
there
be
between
those
different
people
there
hove
in
sight
successively
two
elderly
ladies
lean
and
rather
in
appearance
very
much
alike
evidently
sisters
a
footman
in
livery
an
infantry
corporal
a
fat
gentleman
in
a
soiled
and
patched
and
lastly
a
workman
family
father
mother
and
four
children
all
six
of
them
pale
and
sickly
looking
like
people
who
never
eat
their
fill
and
each
of
the
newcomers
carried
a
basket
or
filled
with
provisions
it
a
picnic
i
cried
it
grows
more
and
more
surprising
said
lupin
and
i
be
satisfied
till
i
know
what
is
happening
behind
that
wall
to
climb
it
was
out
of
the
question
we
also
saw
that
it
finished
at
the
lower
as
well
as
at
the
upper
end
at
a
house
none
of
whose
windows
overlooked
the
enclosure
which
the
wall
contained
during
the
next
hour
no
one
else
came
along
we
vainly
cast
about
for
a
stratagem
and
lupin
whose
fertile
brain
had
exhausted
every
possible
expedient
was
about
to
go
in
search
of
a
ladder
when
suddenly
the
little
door
opened
and
one
of
the
workman
children
came
out
the
boy
ran
up
the
lane
to
the
rue
raynouard
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
carrying
two
bottles
of
water
which
he
set
down
on
the
pavement
to
take
the
big
key
from
his
pocket
by
that
time
lupin
had
left
me
and
was
strolling
slowly
along
the
wall
when
the
child
after
entering
the
enclosure
pushed
back
the
door
lupin
sprang
forward
and
stuck
the
point
of
his
knife
into
the
staple
of
the
lock
the
bolt
failed
to
catch
and
it
became
an
easy
matter
to
push
the
door
ajar
that
done
the
trick
said
lupin
he
cautiously
put
his
hand
through
the
doorway
and
then
to
my
great
surprise
entered
boldly
but
on
following
his
example
i
saw
that
ten
yards
behind
the
wall
a
clump
of
laurels
formed
a
sort
of
curtain
which
allowed
us
to
come
up
unobserved
lupin
took
his
stand
right
in
the
middle
of
the
clump
i
joined
him
and
like
him
pushed
aside
the
branches
of
one
of
the
shrubs
and
the
sight
which
presented
itself
to
my
eyes
was
so
unexpected
that
i
was
unable
to
suppress
an
exclamation
while
lupin
on
his
side
muttered
between
his
teeth
by
jupiter
this
is
a
funny
job
we
saw
before
us
within
the
confined
space
that
lay
between
the
two
windowless
houses
the
identical
scene
represented
in
the
old
picture
which
i
had
bought
at
a
dealer
the
identical
scene
at
the
back
against
the
opposite
wall
the
same
greek
rotunda
displayed
its
slender
columns
in
the
middle
the
same
stone
benches
topped
a
circle
of
four
steps
that
ran
down
to
a
with
flags
on
the
left
the
same
well
raised
its
roof
and
close
at
hand
the
same
showed
its
slanting
gnomon
and
its
marble
face
the
identical
scene
and
what
added
to
the
strangeness
of
the
sight
was
the
memory
obsessing
lupin
and
myself
of
that
date
of
the
of
april
inscribed
in
a
corner
of
the
picture
and
the
thought
that
this
very
day
was
the
of
april
and
that
sixteen
or
seventeen
people
so
different
in
age
condition
and
manners
had
chosen
the
of
april
to
come
together
in
this
forgotten
corner
of
paris
all
of
them
at
the
moment
when
we
caught
sight
of
them
were
sitting
in
separate
groups
on
the
benches
and
steps
and
all
were
eating
not
very
far
from
my
neighbour
and
her
daughter
the
workman
family
and
the
beggar
couple
were
sharing
their
provisions
while
the
footman
the
gentleman
in
the
soiled
suit
the
infantry
corporal
and
the
two
lean
sisters
were
making
a
common
stock
of
their
sliced
ham
their
tins
of
sardines
and
their
gruyère
cheese
the
lady
with
the
little
dog
alone
who
had
brought
no
food
with
her
sat
apart
from
the
others
who
made
a
show
of
turning
their
backs
upon
her
but
louise
offered
her
a
sandwich
whereupon
her
example
was
followed
by
the
two
sisters
and
the
corporal
at
once
began
to
make
himself
as
agreeable
to
the
young
person
as
he
could
it
was
now
one
the
took
out
his
pipe
as
did
the
fat
gentleman
and
when
they
found
that
one
had
no
tobacco
and
the
other
no
matches
their
needs
soon
brought
them
together
the
men
went
and
smoked
by
the
rotunda
and
the
women
joined
them
for
that
matter
all
these
people
seemed
to
know
one
another
quite
well
they
were
at
some
distance
from
where
we
were
standing
so
that
we
could
not
hear
what
they
said
however
we
gradually
perceived
that
the
conversation
was
becoming
animated
the
young
person
with
the
dog
in
particular
who
by
this
time
appeared
to
be
in
great
request
indulged
in
much
voluble
talk
accompanying
her
words
with
many
gestures
which
set
the
little
dog
barking
furiously
but
suddenly
there
was
an
outcry
promptly
followed
by
shouts
of
rage
and
one
and
all
men
and
women
alike
rushed
in
disorder
toward
the
well
one
of
the
workman
brats
was
at
that
moment
coming
out
of
it
fastened
by
his
belt
to
the
hook
at
the
end
of
the
rope
and
the
three
other
urchins
were
drawing
him
up
by
turning
the
handle
more
active
than
the
rest
the
corporal
flung
himself
upon
him
and
forthwith
the
footman
and
the
fat
gentleman
seized
hold
of
him
also
while
the
beggars
and
the
lean
sisters
came
to
blows
with
the
workman
and
his
family
in
a
few
seconds
the
little
boy
had
not
a
stitch
left
on
him
beyond
his
shirt
the
footman
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
rest
of
the
clothes
ran
away
pursued
by
the
corporal
who
snatched
away
the
boy
breeches
which
were
next
torn
from
the
corporal
by
one
of
the
lean
sisters
they
are
mad
i
muttered
feeling
absolutely
at
sea
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
lupin
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
make
head
or
tail
of
what
is
going
on
he
did
not
reply
the
young
lady
with
the
little
dog
tucking
her
pet
under
her
arm
had
started
running
after
the
child
in
the
shirt
who
uttered
loud
yells
the
two
of
them
raced
round
the
in
which
we
stood
hidden
and
the
brat
flung
himself
into
his
arms
at
long
last
louise
who
had
played
a
conciliatory
part
from
the
beginning
succeeded
in
allaying
the
tumult
everybody
sat
down
again
but
there
was
a
reaction
in
all
those
exasperated
people
and
they
remained
motionless
and
silent
as
though
worn
out
with
their
exertions
and
time
went
by
losing
patience
and
beginning
to
feel
the
pangs
of
hunger
i
went
to
the
rue
raynouard
to
fetch
something
to
eat
which
we
divided
while
watching
the
actors
in
the
incomprehensible
comedy
that
was
being
performed
before
our
eyes
they
hardly
stirred
each
minute
that
passed
seemed
to
load
them
with
increasing
melancholy
and
they
sank
into
attitudes
of
discouragement
bent
their
backs
more
and
more
and
sat
absorbed
in
their
meditations
the
afternoon
wore
on
in
this
way
under
a
grey
sky
that
shed
a
dreary
light
over
the
enclosure
are
they
going
to
spend
the
night
here
i
asked
in
a
bored
voice
but
at
five
or
so
the
fat
gentleman
in
the
soiled
took
out
his
watch
the
others
did
the
same
and
all
watch
in
hand
seemed
to
be
anxiously
awaiting
an
event
of
no
little
importance
to
themselves
the
event
did
not
take
place
for
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
the
fat
gentleman
gave
a
gesture
of
despair
stood
up
and
put
on
his
hat
then
lamentations
broke
forth
the
two
lean
sisters
and
the
wife
fell
upon
their
knees
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
lady
with
the
little
dog
and
the
kissed
each
other
and
sobbed
and
we
saw
louise
pressing
her
daughter
sadly
to
her
let
go
said
lupin
you
think
it
over
yes
and
we
have
only
just
time
to
make
ourselves
scarce
we
went
out
unmolested
at
the
top
of
the
lane
lupin
turned
to
the
left
and
leaving
me
outside
entered
the
first
house
in
the
rue
raynouard
the
one
that
backed
on
to
the
enclosure
after
talking
for
a
few
seconds
to
the
porter
he
joined
me
and
we
stopped
a
passing
no
rue
de
turin
he
said
to
the
driver
the
of
no
was
occupied
by
a
notary
office
and
we
were
shown
in
almost
without
waiting
to
maître
valandier
a
smiling
man
of
a
certain
age
lupin
introduced
himself
by
the
name
of
captain
jeanniot
retired
from
the
army
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
build
a
house
to
his
own
liking
and
that
some
one
had
suggested
to
him
a
plot
of
ground
situated
near
the
rue
raynouard
but
that
plot
is
not
for
sale
said
maître
valandier
oh
i
was
told
you
have
been
misinformed
i
fear
the
lawyer
rose
went
to
a
cupboard
and
returned
with
a
picture
which
he
showed
us
i
was
petrified
it
was
the
same
picture
which
i
had
bought
the
same
picture
that
hung
in
louise
room
this
is
a
painting
he
said
of
the
plot
of
ground
to
which
you
refer
it
is
known
as
the
clos
precisely
well
this
close
continued
the
notary
once
formed
part
of
a
large
garden
belonging
to
the
who
was
executed
during
the
terror
all
that
could
be
sold
has
been
sold
piecemeal
by
the
heirs
but
this
last
plot
has
remained
and
will
remain
in
their
joint
possession
unless
the
notary
began
to
laugh
unless
what
asked
lupin
well
it
quite
a
romance
a
rather
curious
romance
in
fact
i
often
amuse
myself
by
looking
through
the
voluminous
documents
of
the
case
would
it
be
indiscreet
if
i
asked
not
at
all
not
at
all
declared
maître
valandier
who
seemed
delighted
on
the
contrary
to
have
found
a
listener
for
his
story
and
without
waiting
to
be
pressed
he
began
at
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
louis
agrippa
on
the
pretence
of
joining
his
wife
who
was
staying
at
geneva
with
their
daughter
pauline
shut
up
his
mansion
in
the
faubourg
dismissed
his
servants
and
with
his
son
charles
came
and
took
up
his
abode
in
his
at
passy
where
he
was
known
to
nobody
except
an
old
and
devoted
he
remained
there
in
hiding
for
three
years
and
he
had
every
reason
to
hope
that
his
retreat
would
not
be
discovered
when
one
day
after
luncheon
as
he
was
having
a
nap
the
old
servant
burst
into
his
room
she
had
seen
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
patrol
of
armed
men
who
seemed
to
be
making
for
the
house
louis
got
ready
quickly
and
at
the
moment
when
the
men
were
knocking
at
the
front
door
disappeared
through
the
door
that
led
to
the
garden
shouting
to
his
son
in
a
scared
voice
to
keep
them
talking
if
only
for
five
minutes
he
may
have
intended
to
escape
and
found
the
outlets
through
the
garden
watched
in
any
case
he
returned
in
six
or
seven
minutes
replied
very
calmly
to
the
questions
put
to
him
and
raised
no
difficulty
about
accompanying
the
men
his
son
charles
although
only
eighteen
years
of
age
was
arrested
also
when
did
this
happen
asked
lupin
it
happened
on
the
day
of
germinal
year
ii
that
is
to
say
on
the
maître
valandier
stopped
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
calendar
that
hung
on
the
wall
and
exclaimed
why
it
was
on
this
very
day
this
is
the
of
april
the
anniversary
of
the
arrest
what
an
odd
coincidence
said
lupin
and
considering
the
period
at
which
it
took
place
the
arrest
no
doubt
had
serious
consequences
oh
most
serious
said
the
notary
laughing
three
months
later
at
the
beginning
of
thermidor
the
mounted
the
scaffold
his
son
charles
was
forgotten
in
prison
and
their
property
was
confiscated
the
property
was
immense
i
suppose
said
lupin
well
there
you
are
that
just
where
the
thing
becomes
complicated
the
property
which
was
in
fact
immense
could
never
be
traced
it
was
discovered
that
the
faubourg
mansion
had
been
sold
before
the
revolution
to
an
englishman
together
with
all
the
and
estates
and
all
the
jewels
securities
and
collections
belonging
to
the
the
convention
instituted
minute
inquiries
as
did
the
directory
afterward
but
the
inquiries
led
to
no
result
there
remained
at
any
rate
the
passy
house
said
lupin
the
house
at
passy
was
bought
for
a
mere
song
by
a
delegate
of
the
commune
the
very
man
who
had
arrested
one
citizen
broquet
citizen
broquet
shut
himself
up
in
the
house
barricaded
the
doors
fortified
the
walls
and
when
charles
was
at
last
set
free
and
appeared
outside
received
him
by
firing
a
musket
at
him
charles
instituted
one
after
another
lost
them
all
and
then
proceeded
to
offer
large
sums
of
money
but
citizen
broquet
proved
intractable
he
had
bought
the
house
and
he
stuck
to
the
house
and
he
would
have
stuck
to
it
until
his
death
if
charles
had
not
obtained
the
support
of
bonaparte
citizen
broquet
cleared
out
on
the
of
february
but
charles
joy
was
so
great
and
his
brain
no
doubt
had
been
so
violently
unhinged
by
all
that
he
had
gone
through
that
on
reaching
the
threshold
of
the
house
of
which
he
had
at
last
recovered
the
ownership
even
before
opening
the
door
he
began
to
dance
and
sing
in
the
street
he
had
gone
clean
off
his
head
by
jove
said
lupin
and
what
became
of
him
his
mother
and
his
sister
pauline
who
had
ended
by
marrying
a
cousin
of
the
same
name
at
geneva
were
both
dead
the
old
took
care
of
him
and
they
lived
together
in
the
passy
house
years
passed
without
any
notable
event
but
suddenly
in
an
unexpected
incident
happened
the
old
servant
made
a
series
of
strange
revelations
on
her
in
the
presence
of
two
witnesses
whom
she
sent
for
she
declared
that
the
had
carried
to
his
house
at
passy
a
number
of
bags
filled
with
gold
and
silver
and
that
those
bags
had
disappeared
a
few
days
before
the
arrest
according
to
earlier
confidences
made
by
charles
who
had
them
from
his
father
the
treasures
were
hidden
in
the
garden
between
the
rotunda
the
and
the
well
in
proof
of
her
statement
she
produced
three
pictures
or
rather
for
they
were
not
yet
framed
three
canvases
which
the
had
painted
during
his
captivity
and
which
he
had
succeeded
in
conveying
to
her
with
instructions
to
hand
them
to
his
wife
his
son
and
his
daughter
tempted
by
the
lure
of
wealth
charles
and
the
old
servant
had
kept
silence
then
came
the
the
recovery
of
the
house
charles
madness
the
servant
own
useless
searches
and
the
treasures
were
still
there
and
they
are
there
now
chuckled
lupin
and
they
will
be
there
always
exclaimed
maître
valandier
unless
unless
citizen
broquet
who
no
doubt
smelt
a
rat
succeeded
in
ferreting
them
out
but
this
is
an
unlikely
supposition
for
citizen
broquet
died
in
extreme
poverty
so
then
so
then
everybody
began
to
hunt
the
children
of
pauline
the
sister
hastened
from
geneva
it
was
discovered
that
charles
had
been
secretly
married
and
that
he
had
sons
all
these
heirs
set
to
work
but
charles
himself
charles
lived
in
the
most
absolute
retirement
he
did
not
leave
his
room
never
well
that
is
the
most
extraordinary
the
most
astounding
part
of
the
story
once
a
year
charles
impelled
by
a
sort
of
subconscious
came
downstairs
took
the
exact
road
which
his
father
had
taken
walked
across
the
garden
and
sat
down
either
on
the
steps
of
the
rotunda
which
you
see
here
in
the
picture
or
on
the
kerb
of
the
well
at
minutes
past
five
he
rose
and
went
indoors
again
and
until
his
death
which
occurred
in
he
never
once
failed
to
perform
this
incomprehensible
pilgrimage
well
the
day
on
which
this
happened
was
invariably
the
of
april
the
anniversary
of
the
arrest
maître
valandier
was
no
longer
smiling
and
himself
seemed
impressed
by
the
amazing
story
which
he
was
telling
us
and
since
charles
death
asked
lupin
after
a
moment
reflection
since
that
time
replied
the
lawyer
with
a
certain
solemnity
of
manner
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
the
heirs
of
charles
and
pauline
have
kept
up
the
pilgrimage
of
the
of
april
during
the
first
few
years
they
made
the
most
thorough
excavations
every
inch
of
the
garden
was
searched
every
clod
of
ground
dug
up
all
this
is
now
over
they
take
hardly
any
pains
all
they
do
is
from
time
to
time
for
no
particular
reason
to
turn
over
a
stone
or
explore
the
well
for
the
most
part
they
are
content
to
sit
down
on
the
steps
of
the
rotunda
like
the
poor
madman
and
like
him
they
wait
and
that
you
see
is
the
sad
part
of
their
destiny
in
those
hundred
years
all
these
people
who
have
succeeded
one
another
from
father
to
son
have
lost
what
shall
i
say
the
energy
of
life
they
have
no
courage
left
no
initiative
they
wait
they
wait
for
the
of
april
and
when
the
of
april
comes
they
wait
for
a
miracle
to
take
place
poverty
has
ended
by
overtaking
every
one
of
them
my
predecessors
and
i
have
sold
first
the
house
in
order
to
build
another
which
yields
a
better
rent
followed
by
bits
of
the
garden
and
further
bits
but
as
to
that
corner
over
there
pointing
to
the
picture
they
would
rather
die
than
sell
it
on
this
they
are
all
agreed
louise
who
is
the
direct
heiress
of
pauline
as
well
as
the
beggars
the
workman
the
footman
the
and
so
on
who
represent
the
unfortunate
charles
there
was
a
fresh
pause
and
lupin
asked
what
is
your
own
opinion
maître
valandier
my
private
opinion
is
that
there
nothing
in
it
what
credit
can
we
give
to
the
statements
of
an
old
servant
enfeebled
by
age
what
importance
can
we
attach
to
the
crotchets
of
a
madman
besides
if
the
had
realized
his
fortune
do
you
think
that
that
fortune
would
have
been
found
one
could
manage
to
hide
a
paper
a
document
in
a
confined
space
like
that
but
not
treasures
still
the
pictures
yes
of
course
but
after
all
are
they
a
sufficient
proof
lupin
bent
over
the
copy
which
the
solicitor
had
taken
from
the
cupboard
and
after
examining
it
at
length
said
you
spoke
of
three
pictures
yes
the
one
which
you
see
was
handed
to
my
predecessor
by
the
heirs
of
charles
louise
possesses
another
as
for
the
third
no
one
knows
what
became
of
it
lupin
looked
at
me
and
continued
and
do
they
all
bear
the
same
date
yes
the
date
inscribed
by
charles
when
he
had
them
framed
not
long
before
his
death
the
same
date
that
is
to
say
the
of
april
year
ii
according
to
the
revolutionary
calendar
as
the
arrest
took
place
in
april
oh
yes
of
course
said
lupin
the
figure
means
he
thought
for
a
few
moments
and
resumed
one
more
question
if
i
may
did
no
one
ever
come
forward
to
solve
the
problem
maître
valandier
threw
up
his
arms
goodness
gracious
me
he
cried
why
it
was
the
plague
of
the
office
one
of
my
predecessors
maître
turbon
was
summoned
to
passy
no
fewer
than
eighteen
times
between
and
by
the
groups
of
heirs
whom
clairvoyants
visionaries
impostors
of
all
sorts
had
promised
that
they
would
discover
the
treasures
at
last
we
laid
down
a
rule
any
outsider
applying
to
institute
a
search
was
to
begin
by
depositing
a
certain
sum
what
sum
a
thousand
francs
and
did
this
have
the
effect
of
frightening
them
off
no
four
years
ago
an
hungarian
hypnotist
tried
the
experiment
and
made
me
waste
a
whole
day
after
that
we
fixed
the
deposit
at
five
thousand
francs
in
case
of
success
a
third
of
the
treasure
goes
to
the
finder
in
case
of
failure
the
deposit
is
forfeited
to
the
heirs
since
then
i
have
been
left
in
peace
here
are
your
five
thousand
francs
the
lawyer
gave
a
start
eh
what
do
you
say
i
say
repeated
lupin
taking
five
from
his
pocket
and
calmly
spreading
them
on
the
table
i
say
that
here
is
the
deposit
of
five
thousand
francs
please
give
me
a
receipt
and
invite
all
the
heirs
to
meet
me
at
passy
on
the
of
april
next
year
the
notary
could
not
believe
his
senses
i
myself
although
lupin
had
accustomed
me
to
these
surprises
was
utterly
taken
back
are
you
serious
asked
maître
valandier
perfectly
serious
but
you
know
i
told
you
my
opinion
all
these
improbable
stories
rest
upon
no
evidence
of
any
kind
i
do
agree
with
you
said
lupin
the
notary
gave
him
the
look
which
we
give
to
a
person
who
is
not
quite
right
in
his
head
then
accepting
the
situation
he
took
his
pen
and
drew
up
a
contract
on
stamped
paper
acknowledging
the
payment
of
the
deposit
by
captain
jeanniot
and
promising
him
a
third
of
such
moneys
as
he
should
discover
if
you
change
your
mind
he
added
you
might
let
me
know
a
week
before
the
time
comes
i
shall
not
inform
the
family
until
the
last
moment
so
as
not
to
give
those
poor
people
too
long
a
spell
of
hope
you
can
inform
them
this
very
day
maître
valandier
it
will
make
them
spend
a
happier
year
we
said
outside
in
the
street
i
cried
so
you
have
hit
upon
something
i
replied
lupin
not
a
bit
of
it
and
that
just
what
amuses
me
but
they
have
been
searching
for
a
hundred
years
it
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
searching
as
of
thinking
now
i
have
three
hundred
and
days
to
think
in
it
is
a
great
deal
more
than
i
want
and
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
forget
all
about
the
business
interesting
though
it
may
be
oblige
me
by
reminding
me
will
you
i
reminded
him
of
it
several
times
during
the
following
months
though
he
never
seemed
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
matter
then
came
a
long
period
during
which
i
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
him
it
was
the
period
as
i
afterward
learnt
of
his
visit
to
armenia
and
of
the
terrible
struggle
on
which
he
embarked
against
abdul
the
damned
a
struggle
which
ended
in
the
tyrant
downfall
i
used
to
write
to
him
however
at
the
address
which
he
gave
me
and
i
was
thus
able
to
send
him
certain
particulars
which
i
had
succeeded
in
gathering
here
and
there
about
my
neighbour
louise
such
as
the
love
which
she
had
conceived
a
few
years
earlier
for
a
very
rich
young
man
who
still
loved
her
but
who
had
been
compelled
by
his
family
to
throw
her
over
the
young
widow
despair
and
the
plucky
life
which
she
led
with
her
little
daughter
lupin
replied
to
none
of
my
letters
i
did
not
know
whether
they
reached
him
and
meantime
the
date
was
drawing
near
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
whether
his
numerous
undertakings
would
not
prevent
him
from
keeping
the
appointment
which
he
himself
had
fixed
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
morning
of
the
of
april
arrived
and
lupin
was
not
with
me
by
the
time
i
had
finished
lunch
it
was
a
twelve
i
left
my
flat
and
took
a
cab
to
passy
i
had
no
sooner
entered
the
lane
than
i
saw
the
workman
four
brats
standing
outside
the
door
in
the
wall
maître
valandier
informed
by
them
of
my
arrival
hastened
in
my
direction
well
he
cried
where
captain
jeanniot
has
he
come
no
and
i
can
assure
you
that
everybody
is
very
impatient
to
see
him
the
different
groups
began
to
crowd
round
the
lawyer
and
i
noticed
that
all
those
faces
which
i
recognized
had
thrown
off
the
gloomy
and
despondent
expression
which
they
wore
a
year
ago
they
are
full
of
hope
said
maître
valandier
and
it
is
my
fault
but
what
could
i
do
your
friend
made
such
an
impression
upon
me
that
i
spoke
to
these
good
people
with
a
confidence
which
i
can
not
say
i
feel
however
he
seems
a
queer
sort
of
fellow
this
captain
jeanniot
of
yours
he
asked
me
many
questions
and
i
gave
him
a
number
of
more
or
less
fanciful
details
about
the
captain
to
which
the
heirs
listened
nodding
their
heads
in
appreciation
of
my
remarks
of
course
the
truth
was
bound
to
be
discovered
sooner
or
later
said
the
fat
gentleman
in
a
tone
of
conviction
the
infantry
corporal
dazzled
by
the
captain
rank
did
not
entertain
a
doubt
in
his
mind
the
lady
with
the
little
dog
wanted
to
know
if
captain
jeanniot
was
young
but
louise
said
and
suppose
he
does
not
come
we
shall
still
have
the
five
thousand
francs
to
divide
said
the
for
all
that
louise
words
had
damped
their
enthusiasm
their
faces
began
to
look
sullen
and
i
felt
an
atmosphere
as
of
anguish
weighing
upon
us
at
one
the
two
lean
sisters
felt
faint
and
sat
down
then
the
fat
gentleman
in
the
soiled
suit
suddenly
rounded
on
the
notary
it
you
maître
valandier
who
are
to
blame
you
ought
to
have
brought
the
captain
here
by
main
force
he
a
humbug
that
quite
clear
he
gave
me
a
savage
look
and
the
footman
in
his
turn
flung
muttered
curses
at
me
i
confess
that
their
reproaches
seemed
to
me
and
that
lupin
absence
annoyed
me
greatly
he
wo
come
now
i
whispered
to
the
lawyer
and
i
was
thinking
of
beating
a
retreat
when
the
eldest
of
the
brats
appeared
at
the
door
yelling
there
some
one
coming
a
a
motor
was
throbbing
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
a
man
on
a
came
tearing
down
the
lane
at
the
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
suddenly
he
put
on
his
brakes
outside
the
door
and
sprang
from
his
machine
under
the
layer
of
dust
which
covered
him
from
head
to
foot
we
could
see
that
his
his
carefully
creased
trousers
his
black
felt
hat
and
boots
were
not
the
clothes
in
which
a
man
usually
goes
cycling
but
that
not
captain
jeanniot
shouted
the
notary
who
failed
to
recognize
him
yes
it
is
said
lupin
shaking
hands
with
us
i
captain
jeanniot
right
enough
only
i
shaved
off
my
moustache
besides
maître
valandier
here
your
receipt
he
caught
one
of
the
workman
children
by
the
arm
and
said
run
to
the
and
fetch
a
taxi
to
the
corner
of
the
rue
raynouard
look
sharp
i
have
an
urgent
appointment
to
keep
at
two
or
a
at
the
latest
there
was
a
murmur
of
protest
captain
jeanniot
took
out
his
watch
well
it
only
twelve
minutes
to
two
i
have
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
before
me
but
by
jingo
how
tired
i
feel
and
how
hungry
into
the
bargain
the
corporal
thrust
his
into
lupin
hand
and
he
munched
away
at
it
as
he
sat
down
and
said
you
must
forgive
me
i
was
in
the
marseilles
express
which
left
the
rails
between
dijon
and
laroche
there
were
twelve
people
killed
and
any
number
injured
whom
i
had
to
help
then
i
found
this
in
the
maître
valandier
you
must
be
good
enough
to
restore
it
to
the
owner
you
will
find
the
label
fastened
to
the
ah
you
back
my
boy
is
the
taxi
there
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
raynouard
capital
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
hullo
no
time
to
lose
i
stared
at
him
with
eager
curiosity
but
how
great
must
the
excitement
of
the
heirs
have
been
true
they
had
not
the
same
faith
in
captain
jeanniot
that
i
had
in
lupin
nevertheless
their
faces
were
pale
and
drawn
captain
jeanniot
turned
slowly
to
the
left
and
walked
up
to
the
the
pedestal
represented
the
figure
of
a
man
with
a
powerful
torso
who
bore
on
his
shoulders
a
marble
slab
the
surface
of
which
had
been
so
much
worn
by
time
that
we
could
hardly
distinguish
the
engraved
lines
that
marked
the
hours
above
the
slab
a
cupid
with
outspread
wings
held
an
arrow
that
served
as
a
gnomon
the
captain
stood
leaning
forward
for
a
minute
with
attentive
eyes
then
he
said
somebody
lend
me
a
knife
please
a
clock
in
the
neighbourhood
struck
two
at
that
exact
moment
the
shadow
of
the
arrow
was
thrown
upon
the
sunlit
dial
along
the
line
of
a
crack
in
the
marble
which
divided
the
slab
very
nearly
in
half
the
captain
took
the
knife
handed
to
him
and
with
the
point
very
gently
he
began
to
scratch
the
mixture
of
earth
and
moss
that
filled
the
narrow
cleft
almost
immediately
at
a
couple
of
inches
from
the
edge
he
stopped
as
though
his
knife
had
encountered
an
obstacle
inserted
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
withdrew
a
small
object
which
he
rubbed
between
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
gave
to
the
lawyer
here
maître
valandier
something
to
go
on
with
it
was
an
enormous
diamond
the
size
of
a
hazelnut
and
beautifully
cut
the
captain
resumed
his
work
the
next
moment
a
fresh
stop
a
second
diamond
magnificent
and
brilliant
as
the
first
appeared
in
sight
and
then
came
a
third
and
a
fourth
in
a
minute
time
following
the
crack
from
one
edge
to
the
other
and
certainly
without
digging
deeper
than
half
an
inch
the
captain
had
taken
out
eighteen
diamonds
of
the
same
size
during
this
minute
there
was
not
a
cry
not
a
movement
around
the
the
heirs
seemed
paralyzed
with
a
sort
of
stupor
then
the
fat
gentleman
muttered
geminy
and
the
corporal
moaned
oh
captain
oh
captain
the
two
sisters
fell
in
a
dead
faint
the
lady
with
the
little
dog
dropped
on
her
knees
and
prayed
while
the
footman
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
held
his
head
in
his
two
hands
and
louise
wept
when
calm
was
restored
and
all
became
eager
to
thank
captain
jeanniot
they
saw
that
he
was
gone
some
years
passed
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
lupin
about
this
business
he
was
in
a
confidential
vein
and
answered
the
business
of
the
eighteen
diamonds
by
jove
when
i
think
that
three
or
four
generations
of
my
had
been
hunting
for
the
solution
and
the
eighteen
diamonds
were
there
all
the
time
under
a
little
mud
and
dust
but
how
did
you
guess
i
did
not
guess
i
reflected
i
doubt
if
i
need
even
have
reflected
i
was
struck
from
the
beginning
by
the
fact
that
the
whole
circumstance
was
governed
by
one
primary
question
the
question
of
time
when
charles
was
still
in
possession
of
his
wits
he
wrote
a
date
upon
the
three
pictures
later
in
the
gloom
in
which
he
was
struggling
a
faint
glimmer
of
intelligence
led
him
every
year
to
the
centre
of
the
old
garden
and
the
same
faint
glimmer
led
him
away
from
it
every
year
at
the
same
moment
that
is
to
say
at
minutes
past
five
something
must
have
acted
on
the
disordered
machinery
of
his
brain
in
this
way
what
was
the
superior
force
that
controlled
the
poor
madman
movements
obviously
the
instinctive
notion
of
time
represented
by
the
in
the
pictures
it
was
the
annual
revolution
of
the
earth
around
the
sun
that
brought
charles
back
to
the
garden
at
a
fixed
date
and
it
was
the
daily
revolution
upon
its
own
axis
that
took
him
from
it
at
a
fixed
hour
that
is
to
say
at
the
hour
most
likely
when
the
sun
concealed
by
objects
different
from
those
of
ceased
to
light
the
passy
garden
now
of
all
this
the
was
the
symbol
and
that
is
why
i
at
once
knew
where
to
look
but
how
did
you
settle
the
hour
at
which
to
begin
looking
simply
by
the
pictures
a
man
living
at
that
time
such
as
charles
would
have
written
either
germinal
year
ii
or
else
april
but
not
april
year
ii
i
was
astounded
that
no
one
had
thought
of
that
then
the
figure
stood
for
two
evidently
and
what
must
have
happened
was
this
the
began
by
turning
his
fortune
into
solid
gold
and
silver
money
then
by
way
of
additional
precaution
with
this
gold
and
silver
he
bought
eighteen
wonderful
diamonds
when
he
was
surprised
by
the
arrival
of
the
patrol
he
fled
into
his
garden
which
was
the
best
place
to
hide
the
diamonds
chance
caused
his
eyes
to
light
upon
the
it
was
two
the
shadow
of
the
arrow
was
then
falling
along
the
crack
in
the
marble
he
obeyed
this
sign
of
the
shadow
rammed
his
eighteen
diamonds
into
the
dust
and
calmly
went
back
and
surrendered
to
the
soldiers
but
the
shadow
of
the
arrow
coincides
with
the
crack
in
the
marble
every
day
of
the
year
and
not
only
on
the
of
april
you
forget
my
dear
chap
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
lunatic
and
that
he
remembered
only
this
date
of
the
of
april
very
well
but
you
once
you
had
solved
the
riddle
could
easily
have
made
your
way
into
the
enclosure
and
taken
the
diamonds
quite
true
and
i
should
not
have
hesitated
if
i
had
had
to
do
with
people
of
another
description
but
i
really
felt
sorry
for
those
poor
wretches
and
then
you
know
the
sort
of
idiot
that
lupin
is
the
idea
of
appearing
suddenly
as
a
benevolent
genius
and
amazing
his
kind
would
be
enough
to
make
him
commit
any
sort
of
folly
tah
i
cried
the
folly
was
not
so
great
as
all
that
six
magnificent
diamonds
how
delighted
the
heirs
must
have
been
to
fulfil
their
part
of
the
contract
lupin
looked
at
me
and
burst
into
uncontrollable
laughter
so
you
have
heard
oh
what
a
joke
the
delight
of
the
heirs
why
my
dear
fellow
on
the
next
day
that
worthy
captain
jeanniot
had
so
many
mortal
enemies
on
the
very
next
day
the
two
lean
sisters
and
the
fat
gentleman
organized
an
opposition
a
contract
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on
because
as
could
easily
be
proved
there
was
no
such
person
as
captain
jeanniot
where
did
that
adventurer
spring
from
just
let
him
sue
them
and
they
soon
show
him
what
was
what
louise
too
no
louise
protested
against
that
piece
of
rascality
but
what
could
she
do
against
so
many
besides
now
that
she
was
rich
she
got
back
her
young
man
i
have
heard
of
her
since
so
so
my
dear
fellow
i
was
caught
in
a
trap
with
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
and
i
had
to
compromise
and
accept
one
modest
diamond
as
my
share
the
smallest
and
the
least
handsome
of
the
lot
that
comes
of
doing
best
to
help
people
and
lupin
grumbled
between
his
teeth
oh
gratitude
all
humbug
where
should
we
honest
men
be
if
we
had
not
our
conscience
and
the
satisfaction
of
duty
performed
to
reward
us
iv
the
infernal
trap
when
the
race
was
over
a
crowd
of
people
streaming
toward
the
exit
from
the
grand
stand
pushed
against
nicolas
dugrival
he
brought
his
hand
smartly
to
the
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket
what
the
matter
asked
his
wife
i
still
feel
nervous
with
that
money
on
me
i
afraid
of
some
nasty
accident
she
muttered
and
i
ca
understand
you
how
can
you
think
of
carrying
such
a
sum
about
with
you
every
farthing
we
possess
lord
knows
it
cost
us
trouble
enough
to
earn
pooh
he
said
no
one
would
guess
that
it
is
here
in
my
yes
yes
she
grumbled
that
young
whom
we
discharged
last
week
knew
all
about
it
did
he
gabriel
yes
aunt
said
a
youth
standing
beside
her
nicolas
dugrival
his
wife
and
his
nephew
gabriel
were
figures
at
the
where
the
regular
frequenters
saw
them
almost
every
day
dugrival
a
big
fat
man
who
looked
as
if
he
knew
how
to
enjoy
life
his
wife
also
built
on
heavy
lines
with
a
coarse
vulgar
face
and
always
dressed
in
a
silk
much
the
worse
for
wear
the
nephew
quite
young
slender
with
pale
features
dark
eyes
and
fair
and
rather
curly
hair
as
a
rule
the
couple
remained
seated
throughout
the
afternoon
it
was
gabriel
who
betted
for
his
uncle
watching
the
horses
in
the
paddock
picking
up
tips
to
right
and
left
among
the
jockeys
and
running
backward
and
forward
between
the
stands
and
the
luck
had
favoured
them
that
day
for
three
times
dugrival
neighbours
saw
the
young
man
come
back
and
hand
him
money
the
fifth
race
was
just
finishing
dugrival
lit
a
cigar
at
that
moment
a
gentleman
in
a
brown
suit
with
a
face
ending
in
a
peaked
grey
beard
came
up
to
him
and
asked
in
a
confidential
whisper
does
this
happen
to
belong
to
you
sir
and
he
displayed
a
gold
watch
and
chain
dugrival
gave
a
start
why
yes
it
mine
look
here
are
my
initials
nicolas
dugrival
and
he
at
once
with
a
movement
of
terror
clapped
his
hand
to
his
the
was
still
there
ah
he
said
greatly
relieved
that
a
piece
of
luck
but
all
the
same
how
on
earth
was
it
done
do
you
know
the
scoundrel
yes
we
got
him
locked
up
pray

with
me
and
we
soon
look
into
the
matter

have
i
the
honour
delangle
i
have
sent
to
let
marquenne
the
magistrate
know
nicolas
dugrival
went
out
with
the
inspector
and
the
two
of
them
started
for
the
commissary
office
some
distance
behind
the
grand
stand
they
were
within
fifty
yards
of
it
when
the
inspector
was
accosted
by
a
man
who
said
to
him
hurriedly
the
fellow
with
the
watch
has
blabbed
we
are
on
the
tracks
of
a
whole
gang
marquenne
wants
you
to
wait
for
him
at
the
and
to
keep
a
near
the
fourth
booth
there
was
a
crowd
outside
the
and
inspector
delangle
muttered
it
an
absurd
arrangement
whom
am
i
to
look
out
for
just
like
m
marquenne
he
pushed
aside
a
group
of
people
who
were
crowding
too
close
upon
him
by
jove
one
has
to
use
one
elbows
here
and
keep
a
tight
hold
on
one
purse
that
the
way
you
got
your
watch
pinched
m
dugrival
i
ca
understand
oh
if
you
knew
how
those
gentry
go
to
work
one
never
guesses
what
they
up
to
next
one
of
them
treads
on
your
foot
another
gives
you
a
poke
in
the
eye
with
his
stick
and
the
third
picks
your
pocket
before
you
know
where
you
are
i
been
had
that
way
myself
he
stopped
and
then
continued
angrily
but
bother
it
what
the
use
of
hanging
about
here
what
a
mob
it
unbearable
ah
there
marquenne
making
signs
to
us
one
moment
please
and
be
sure
and
wait
for
me
here
he
shouldered
his
way
through
the
crowd
nicolas
dugrival
followed
him
for
a
moment
with
his
eyes
once
the
inspector
was
out
of
sight
he
stood
a
little
to
one
side
to
avoid
being
hustled
a
few
minutes
passed
the
sixth
race
was
about
to
start
when
dugrival
saw
his
wife
and
nephew
looking
for
him
he
explained
to
them
that
inspector
delangle
was
arranging
matters
with
the
magistrate
have
you
your
money
still
asked
his
wife
why
of
course
i
have
he
replied
the
inspector
and
i
took
good
care
i
assure
you
not
to
let
the
crowd
jostle
us
he
felt
his
jacket
gave
a
stifled
cry
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
began
to
stammer
inarticulate
syllables
while
mme
dugrival
gasped
in
dismay
what
is
it
what
the
matter
stolen
he
moaned
the
the
fifty
notes
it
not
true
she
screamed
it
not
true
yes
the
inspector
a
common
sharper
he
the
man
she
uttered
absolute
yells
thief
thief
stop
thief
my
husband
been
robbed
fifty
thousand
francs
we
are
ruined
thief
thief
in
a
moment
they
were
surrounded
by
policemen
and
taken
to
the
commissary
office
dugrival
went
like
a
lamb
absolutely
bewildered
his
wife
continued
to
shriek
at
the
top
of
her
voice
piling
up
explanations
railing
against
the
inspector
have
him
looked
for
have
him
found
a
brown
suit
a
pointed
beard
oh
the
villain
to
think
what
he
robbed
us
of
fifty
thousand
francs
why
why
dugrival
what
are
you
doing
with
one
bound
she
flung
herself
upon
her
husband
too
late
he
had
pressed
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
against
his
temple
a
shot
rang
out
dugrival
fell
he
was
dead
the
reader
can
not
have
forgotten
the
commotion
made
by
the
newspapers
in
connection
with
this
case
nor
how
they
jumped
at
the
opportunity
once
more
to
accuse
the
police
of
carelessness
and
blundering
was
it
conceivable
that
a
could
play
the
part
of
an
inspector
like
that
in
broad
daylight
and
in
a
public
place
and
rob
a
respectable
man
with
impunity
nicolas
dugrival
widow
kept
the
controversy
alive
thanks
to
her
jeremiads
and
to
the
interviews
which
she
granted
on
every
hand
a
reporter
had
secured
a
snapshot
of
her
in
front
of
her
husband
body
holding
up
her
hand
and
swearing
to
revenge
his
death
her
nephew
gabriel
was
standing
beside
her
with
hatred
pictured
in
his
face
he
too
it
appeared
in
a
few
words
uttered
in
a
whisper
but
in
a
tone
of
fierce
determination
had
taken
an
oath
to
pursue
and
catch
the
murderer
the
accounts
described
the
humble
apartment
which
they
occupied
at
the
batignolles
and
as
they
had
been
robbed
of
all
their
means
a
opened
a
subscription
on
their
behalf
as
for
the
mysterious
delangle
he
remained
undiscovered
two
men
were
arrested
but
had
to
be
released
forthwith
the
police
took
up
a
number
of
clues
which
were
at
once
abandoned
more
than
one
name
was
mentioned
and
lastly
they
accused
arsène
lupin
an
action
which
provoked
the
famous
burglar
celebrated
cable
dispatched
from
new
york
six
days
after
the
incident
protest
indignantly
against
calumny
invented
by
baffled
police
send
my
condolences
to
unhappy
victims
instructing
my
bankers
to
remit
them
fifty
thousand
francs
lupin
true
enough
on
the
day
after
the
publication
of
the
cable
a
stranger
rang
at
mme
dugrival
door
and
handed
her
an
envelope
the
envelope
contained
fifty
notes
this
theatrical
stroke
was
not
at
all
calculated
to
allay
the
universal
comment
but
an
event
soon
occurred
which
provided
any
amount
of
additional
excitement
two
days
later
the
people
living
in
the
same
house
as
mme
dugrival
and
her
nephew
were
awakened
at
four
in
the
morning
by
horrible
cries
and
shrill
calls
for
help
they
rushed
to
the
flat
the
porter
succeeded
in
opening
the
door
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
carried
by
one
of
the
neighbours
he
found
gabriel
stretched
at
in
his
bedroom
with
his
wrists
and
ankles
bound
and
a
gag
forced
into
his
mouth
while
in
the
next
room
mme
dugrival
lay
with
her
life
blood
ebbing
away
through
a
great
gash
in
her
breast
she
whispered
the
money
i
been
robbed
all
the
notes
gone
and
she
fainted
away
what
had
happened
gabriel
said
and
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
speak
mme
dugrival
completed
her
nephew
story
that
he
was
startled
from
his
sleep
by
finding
himself
attacked
by
two
men
one
of
whom
gagged
him
while
the
other
fastened
him
down
he
was
unable
to
see
the
men
in
the
dark
but
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
struggle
between
them
and
his
aunt
it
was
a
terrible
struggle
mme
dugrival
declared
the
ruffians
who
obviously
knew
their
way
about
guided
by
some
intuition
made
straight
for
the
little
cupboard
containing
the
money
and
in
spite
of
her
resistance
and
outcries
laid
hands
upon
the
bundle
of
as
they
left
one
of
them
whom
she
had
bitten
in
the
arm
stabbed
her
with
a
knife
whereupon
the
men
had
both
fled
which
way
she
was
asked
through
the
door
of
my
bedroom
and
afterward
i
suppose
through
the
impossible
the
porter
would
have
noticed
them
for
the
whole
mystery
lay
in
this
how
had
the
ruffians
entered
the
house
and
how
did
they
manage
to
leave
it
there
was
no
outlet
open
to
them
was
it
one
of
the
tenants
a
careful
inquiry
proved
the
absurdity
of
such
a
supposition
what
then
ganimard
who
was
placed
in
special
charge
of
the
case
confessed
that
he
had
never
known
anything
more
bewildering
it
very
like
lupin
he
said
and
yet
it
not
lupin
no
more
in
it
than
meets
the
eye
something
very
doubtful
and
suspicious
besides
if
it
were
lupin
why
should
he
take
back
the
fifty
thousand
francs
which
he
sent
there
another
question
that
puzzles
me
what
is
the
connection
between
the
second
robbery
and
the
first
the
one
on
the
the
whole
thing
is
incomprehensible
and
i
have
a
sort
of
feeling
which
is
very
rare
with
me
that
it
is
no
use
hunting
for
my
part
i
give
it
up
the
threw
himself
into
the
case
with
heart
and
soul
the
reporters
united
their
efforts
with
those
of
the
police
a
famous
english
crossed
the
channel
a
wealthy
american
whose
head
had
been
turned
by
offered
a
big
reward
to
whosoever
should
supply
the
first
information
leading
to
the
discovery
of
the
truth
six
weeks
later
no
one
was
any
the
wiser
the
public
adopted
ganimard
view
and
the
himself
grew
tired
of
struggling
in
a
darkness
which
only
became
denser
as
time
went
on
and
life
continued
as
usual
with
dugrival
widow
nursed
by
her
nephew
she
soon
recovered
from
her
wound
in
the
mornings
gabriel
settled
her
in
an
at
the
window
did
the
rooms
and
then
went
out
marketing
he
cooked
their
lunch
without
even
accepting
the
proffered
assistance
of
the
porter
wife
worried
by
the
police
investigations
and
especially
by
the
requests
for
interviews
the
aunt
and
nephew
refused
to
see
anybody
not
even
the
portress
whose
chatter
disturbed
and
wearied
mme
dugrival
was
admitted
she
fell
back
upon
gabriel
whom
she
accosted
each
time
that
he
passed
her
room
take
care
gabriel
you
both
of
you
being
spied
upon
there
are
men
watching
you
why
only
last
night
my
husband
caught
a
fellow
staring
up
at
your
windows
nonsense
said
gabriel
it
all
right
that
the
police
protecting
us
one
afternoon
at
about
four
there
was
a
violent
altercation
between
two
costermongers
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
the
porter
wife
at
once
left
her
room
to
listen
to
the
invectives
which
the
adversaries
were
hurling
at
each
other
heads
her
back
was
no
sooner
turned
than
a
man
young
of
medium
height
and
dressed
in
a
grey
suit
of
irreproachable
cut
slipped
into
the
house
and
ran
up
the
staircase
when
he
came
to
the
third
floor
he
rang
the
bell
receiving
no
answer
he
rang
again
at
the
third
summons
the
door
opened
mme
dugrival
he
asked
taking
off
his
hat
mme
dugrival
is
still
an
invalid
and
unable
to
see
any
one
said
gabriel
who
stood
in
the
hall
it
most
important
that
i
should
speak
to
her
i
am
her
nephew
and
perhaps
i
could
take
her
a
message
very
well
said
the
man
please
tell
mme
dugrival
that
an
accident
has
supplied
me
with
valuable
information
concerning
the
robbery
from
which
she
has
suffered
and
that
i
should
like
to
go
over
the
flat
and
ascertain
certain
particulars
for
myself
i
am
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
inquiry
and
my
call
is
sure
to
be
of
use
to
her
gabriel
examined
the
visitor
for
a
moment
reflected
and
said
in
that
case
i
suppose
my
aunt
will
consent
pray
come
in
he
opened
the
door
of
the
and
stepped
back
to
allow
the
other
to
pass
the
stranger
walked
to
the
threshold
but
at
the
moment
when
he
was
crossing
it
gabriel
raised
his
arm
and
with
a
swift
movement
struck
him
with
a
dagger
over
the
right
shoulder
a
burst
of
laughter
rang
through
the
room
got
him
cried
mme
dugrival
darting
up
from
her
chair
well
done
gabriel
but
i
say
you
have
killed
the
scoundrel
have
you
i
do
think
so
aunt
it
a
small
blade
and
i
did
strike
him
too
hard
the
man
was
staggering
with
his
hands
stretched
in
front
of
him
and
his
face
deathly
pale
you
fool
sneered
the
widow
so
you
fallen
into
the
trap
and
a
good
job
too
we
been
looking
out
for
you
a
long
time
come
my
fine
fellow
down
with
you
you
do
care
about
it
do
you
but
you
help
yourself
you
see
that
right
one
knee
on
the
ground
before
the
missus
now
the
other
knee
how
well
we
been
brought
up
crash
there
we
go
on
the
floor
lord
if
my
poor
dugrival
could
only
see
him
like
that
and
now
gabriel
to
work
she
went
to
her
bedroom
and
opened
one
of
the
doors
of
a
hanging
wardrobe
filled
with
dresses
pulling
these
aside
she
pushed
open
another
door
which
formed
the
back
of
the
wardrobe
and
led
to
a
room
in
the
next
house
help
me
carry
him
gabriel
and
you
nurse
him
as
well
as
you
can
wo
you
for
the
present
he
worth
his
weight
in
gold
to
us
the
artist
the
hours
succeeded
one
another
days
passed
one
morning
the
wounded
man
regained
a
moment
consciousness
he
raised
his
eyelids
and
looked
around
him
he
was
lying
in
a
room
larger
than
that
in
which
he
had
been
stabbed
a
room
sparsely
furnished
with
thick
curtains
hanging
before
the
windows
from
top
to
bottom
there
was
light
enough
however
to
enable
him
to
see
young
gabriel
dugrival
seated
on
a
chair
beside
him
and
watching
him
ah
it
you
youngster
he
murmured
i
congratulate
you
my
lad
you
have
a
sure
and
pretty
touch
with
the
dagger
and
he
fell
asleep
again
that
day
and
the
following
days
he
woke
up
several
times
and
each
time
he
saw
the
stripling
pale
face
his
thin
lips
and
his
dark
eyes
with
the
hard
look
in
them
you
frighten
me
he
said
if
you
have
sworn
to
do
for
me
do
stand
on
ceremony
but
cheer
up
for
goodness
sake
the
thought
of
death
has
always
struck
me
as
the
most
humorous
thing
in
the
world
whereas
with
you
old
chap
it
simply
becomes
lugubrious
i
prefer
to
go
to
sleep
still
gabriel
in
obedience
to
mme
dugrival
orders
continued
to
nurse
him
with
the
utmost
care
and
attention
the
patient
was
almost
free
from
fever
and
was
beginning
to
take
and
milk
he
gained
a
little
strength
and
jested
when
will
the
convalescent
be
allowed
his
first
drive
is
the
there
why
cheer
up
stupid
you
look
like
a
contemplating
a
crime
come
just
one
little
smile
for
daddy
one
day
on
waking
he
had
a
very
unpleasant
feeling
of
constraint
after
a
few
efforts
he
perceived
that
during
his
sleep
his
legs
chest
and
arms
had
been
fastened
to
the
bedstead
with
thin
wire
strands
that
cut
into
his
flesh
at
the
least
movements
ah
he
said
to
his
keeper
this
time
it
the
great
performance
the
chicken
going
to
be
bled
are
you
operating
angel
gabriel
if
so
see
that
your
razor
nice
and
clean
old
chap
the
antiseptic
treatment
you
please
but
he
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
a
key
grating
in
the
lock
the
door
opposite
opened
and
mme
dugrival
appeared
she
approached
slowly
took
a
chair
and
producing
a
revolver
from
her
pocket
cocked
it
and
laid
it
on
the
table
by
the
bedside
brrrrr
said
the
prisoner
we
might
be
at
the
ambigu
fourth
act
the
traitor
doom
and
the
fair
sex
to
do
the
deed
the
hand
of
the
graces
what
an
honour
mme
dugrival
i
rely
on
you
not
to
disfigure
me
hold
your
tongue
lupin
ah
so
you
know
by
jove
how
clever
we
are
hold
your
tongue
lupin
there
was
a
solemn
note
in
her
voice
that
impressed
the
captive
and
compelled
him
to
silence
he
watched
his
two
gaolers
in
turns
the
bloated
features
and
red
complexion
of
mme
dugrival
formed
a
striking
contrast
with
her
nephew
refined
face
but
they
both
wore
the
same
air
of
implacable
resolve
the
widow
leant
forward
and
said
are
you
prepared
to
answer
my
questions
why
not
then
listen
to
me
how
did
you
know
that
dugrival
carried
all
his
money
in
his
pocket
servants
gossip
a
young
whom
we
had
in
our
employ
was
that
it
yes
and
did
you
steal
dugrival
watch
in
order
to
give
it
back
to
him
and
inspire
him
with
confidence
yes
she
suppressed
a
movement
of
fury
you
fool
you
fool
what
you
rob
my
man
you
drive
him
to
kill
himself
and
instead
of
making
tracks
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
and
hiding
yourself
you
go
on
playing
lupin
in
the
heart
of
paris
did
you
forget
that
i
swore
on
my
dead
husband
head
to
find
his
murderer
that
what
staggers
me
said
lupin
how
did
you
come
to
suspect
me
how
why
you
gave
yourself
away
i
did
of
course
the
fifty
thousand
francs
well
what
about
it
a
present
yes
a
present
which
you
gave
cabled
instructions
to
have
sent
to
me
so
as
to
make
believe
that
you
were
in
america
on
the
day
of
the
races
a
present
indeed
what
humbug
the
fact
is
you
did
like
to
think
of
the
poor
fellow
whom
you
had
murdered
so
you
restored
the
money
to
the
widow
publicly
of
course
because
you
love
playing
to
the
gallery
and
ranting
and
posing
like
the
mountebank
that
you
are
that
was
all
very
nicely
thought
out
only
my
fine
fellow
you
ought
not
to
have
sent
me
the
selfsame
notes
that
were
stolen
from
dugrival
yes
you
silly
fool
the
selfsame
notes
and
no
others
we
knew
the
numbers
dugrival
and
i
did
and
you
were
stupid
enough
to
send
the
bundle
to
me
now
do
you
understand
your
folly
lupin
began
to
laugh
it
was
a
pretty
blunder
i
confess
i
not
responsible
i
gave
different
orders
but
all
the
same
i
ca
blame
any
one
except
myself
ah
so
you
admit
it
you
signed
your
theft
and
you
signed
your
ruin
at
the
same
time
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
done
but
to
find
you
find
you
no
better
than
that
sensible
people
do
find
lupin
they
make
him
come
to
them
that
was
a
masterly
notion
it
belongs
to
my
young
nephew
who
loathes
you
as
much
as
i
do
if
possible
and
who
knows
you
thoroughly
through
reading
all
the
books
that
have
been
written
about
you
he
knows
your
prying
nature
your
need
to
be
always
plotting
your
mania
for
hunting
in
the
dark
and
unravelling
what
others
have
failed
to
unravel
he
also
knows
that
sort
of
sham
kindness
of
yours
the
drivelling
sentimentality
that
makes
you
shed
crocodile
tears
over
the
people
you
victimize
and
he
planned
the
whole
farce
he
invented
the
story
of
the
two
burglars
the
second
theft
of
fifty
thousand
francs
oh
i
swear
to
you
before
heaven
that
the
stab
which
i
gave
myself
with
my
own
hands
never
hurt
me
and
i
swear
to
you
before
heaven
that
we
spent
a
glorious
time
waiting
for
you
the
boy
and
i
peeping
out
at
your
confederates
who
prowled
under
our
windows
taking
their
bearings
and
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
you
were
bound
to
come
seeing
that
you
had
restored
the
widow
dugrival
fifty
thousand
francs
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
allow
the
widow
dugrival
to
be
robbed
of
her
fifty
thousand
francs
you
were
bound
to
come
attracted
by
the
scent
of
the
mystery
you
were
bound
to
come
for
swagger
out
of
vanity
and
you
come
the
widow
gave
a
strident
laugh
well
played
was
it
the
lupin
of
lupins
the
master
of
masters
inaccessible
and
invisible
caught
in
a
trap
by
a
woman
and
a
boy
here
he
is
in
flesh
and
bone
here
he
is
with
hands
and
feet
tied
no
more
dangerous
than
a
sparrow
here
is
he
here
he
is
she
shook
with
joy
and
began
to
pace
the
room
throwing
sidelong
glances
at
the
bed
like
a
wild
beast
that
does
not
for
a
moment
take
its
eyes
from
its
victim
and
never
had
lupin
beheld
greater
hatred
and
savagery
in
any
human
being
enough
of
this
prattle
she
said
suddenly
restraining
herself
she
stalked
back
to
him
and
in
a
quite
different
tone
in
a
hollow
voice
laying
stress
on
every
syllable
thanks
to
the
papers
in
your
pocket
lupin
i
have
made
good
use
of
the
last
twelve
days
i
know
all
your
affairs
all
your
schemes
all
your
assumed
names
all
the
organization
of
your
band
all
the
lodgings
which
you
possess
in
paris
and
elsewhere
i
have
even
visited
one
of
them
the
most
secret
the
one
where
you
hide
your
papers
your
ledgers
and
the
whole
story
of
your
financial
operations
the
result
of
my
investigations
is
very
satisfactory
here
are
four
cheques
taken
from
four
and
corresponding
with
four
accounts
which
you
keep
at
four
different
banks
under
four
different
names
i
have
filled
in
each
of
them
for
ten
thousand
francs
a
larger
figure
would
have
been
too
risky
and
now
sign
by
jove
said
lupin
sarcastically
this
is
blackmail
my
worthy
mme
dugrival
that
takes
your
breath
away
what
it
takes
my
breath
away
as
you
say
and
you
find
an
adversary
who
is
a
match
for
you
the
adversary
is
far
beyond
me
so
the
trap
let
us
call
it
infernal
the
infernal
trap
into
which
i
have
fallen
was
laid
not
merely
by
a
widow
thirsting
for
revenge
but
also
by
a
business
woman
anxious
to
increase
her
capital
just
so
my
congratulations
and
while
i
think
of
it
used
dugrival
perhaps
to
you
have
hit
it
lupin
after
all
why
conceal
the
fact
it
will
relieve
your
conscience
yes
lupin
dugrival
used
to
work
on
the
same
lines
as
yourself
oh
not
on
the
same
scale
we
were
modest
people
a
louis
here
a
louis
there
a
purse
or
two
which
we
trained
gabriel
to
pick
up
at
the
races
and
in
this
way
we
had
made
our
little
pile
just
enough
to
buy
a
small
place
in
the
country
i
prefer
it
that
way
said
lupin
that
all
right
i
only
telling
you
so
that
you
may
know
that
i
am
not
a
beginner
and
that
you
have
nothing
to
hope
for
a
rescue
no
the
room
in
which
we
now
are
communicates
with
my
bedroom
it
has
a
private
outlet
of
which
nobody
knows
it
was
dugrival
special
apartment
he
used
to
see
his
friends
here
he
kept
his
implements
and
tools
here
his
disguises
his
telephone
even
as
you
perceive
so
there
no
hope
you
see
your
accomplices
have
given
up
looking
for
you
here
i
have
sent
them
off
on
another
track
your
goose
is
cooked
do
you
begin
to
realize
the
position
yes
then
sign
the
cheques
and
when
i
have
signed
them
shall
i
be
free
i
must
cash
them
first
and
after
that
after
that
on
my
soul
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
you
will
be
free
i
do
trust
you
have
you
any
choice
that
true
hand
me
the
cheques
she
unfastened
lupin
right
hand
gave
him
a
pen
and
said
do
forget
that
the
four
cheques
require
four
different
signatures
and
that
the
handwriting
has
to
be
altered
in
each
case
never
fear
he
signed
the
cheques
gabriel
said
the
widow
it
is
ten
if
i
am
not

of
his
tricks

his
brains

the
revolver
with
which
your
uncle
shot
himself

are
five
bullets
left
out
of
the
six
that
will
be
ample
she
left
the
room
humming
a
tune
as
she
went
lupin
mumbled
i
would
give
twopence
for
my
life
he
shut
his
eyes
for
an
instant
and
then
suddenly
said
to
gabriel
how
much
and
when
the
other
did
not
appear
to
understand
he
grew
irritated
i
mean
what
i
say
how
much
answer
me
ca

we
drive
the
same
trade

and
i
steal

ought
to
come
to
terms

bargain

easy
post

thousand
twenty
thousand
fix
your
own
price
do
be
shy
there
plenty
to
be
had
for
the
asking
an
angry
shiver
passed
through
his
frame
as
he
saw
the
impassive
face
of
his
keeper
oh
the
beggar
wo
even
answer
why
you
ca
have
been
so
fond
of
old
dugrival
as
all
that
listen
to
me
if
you
consent
to
release
me
but
he
interrupted
himself
the
young
man
eyes
wore
the
cruel
expression
which
he
knew
so
well
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
move
him
hang
it
all
he
snarled
i
not
going
to
croak
here
like
a
dog
oh
if
i
could
only
stiffening
all
his
muscles
he
tried
to
burst
his
bonds
making
a
violent
effort
that
drew
a
cry
of
pain
from
him
and
he
fell
back
upon
his
bed
exhausted
well
well
he
muttered
after
a
moment
it
as
the
widow
said
my
goose
is
cooked
nothing
to
be
done
lupin
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
half
an
hour
gabriel
moving
closer
to
lupin
saw
that
his
eyes
were
shut
and
that
his
breath
came
evenly
like
that
of
a
man
sleeping
but
lupin
said
do
imagine
that
i
asleep
youngster
no
people
do
sleep
at
a
moment
like
this
only
i
am
consoling
myself
needs
must
eh
and
then
i
am
thinking
of
what
is
to
come
after
exactly
i
have
a
little
theory
of
my
own
about
that
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
me
but
i
believe
in
metempsychosis
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
however
i
say
boy
suppose
we
shook
hands
before
we
part
you
wo
then
good
health
and
a
long
life
to
you
gabriel
he
closed
his
eyelids
and
did
not
stir
again
before
mme
return
the
widow
entered
with
a
lively
step
at
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
she
seemed
greatly
excited
i
have
the
money
she
said
to
her
nephew
run
away
i
join
you
in
the
motor
down
below
but
i
do
want
your
help
to
finish
him
off
i
can
do
that
alone
still
if
you
feel
like
seeing
the
sort
of
a
face
a
rogue
can
pull
pass
me
the
weapon
gabriel
handed
her
the
revolver
and
the
widow
continued
have
you
burnt
our
papers
yes
then
to
work
and
as
soon
as
he
done
for
be
off
the
shots
may
bring
the
neighbours
they
must
find
both
the
flats
empty
she
went
up
to
the
bed
are
you
ready
lupin
ready
not
the
word
i
burning
with
impatience
have
you
any
request
to
make
of
me
none
then
one
word
though
what
is
it
if
i
meet
dugrival
in
the
next
world
what
message
am
i
to
give
him
from
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
put
the
barrel
of
the
revolver
to
temple
that
it
he
said
and
be
sure
your
hand
does
shake
my
dear
lady
it
wo
hurt
you
i
swear
are
you
ready
at
the
word
of
command
eh
one
two
three
the
widow
pulled
the
trigger
a
shot
rang
out
is
this
death
said
lupin
that
funny
i
should
have
thought
it
was
something
much
more
different
from
life
there
was
a
second
shot
gabriel
snatched
the
weapon
from
his
hands
and
examined
it
ah
he
exclaimed
the
bullets
have
been
removed
there
are
only
the
left
his
aunt
and
he
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
and
confused
impossible
she
blurted
out
who
could
have
done
it
an
inspector
the
she
stopped
and
in
a
low
voice
hark
i
hear
a
noise
they
listened
and
the
widow
went
into
the
hall
she
returned
furious
exasperated
by
her
failure
and
by
the
scare
which
she
had
received
there
nobody
there
it
must
have
been
the
neighbours
going
out
we
have
plenty
of
time
ah
lupin
you
were
beginning
to
make
merry
the
knife
gabriel
it
in
my
room
go
and
fetch
it
gabriel
hurried
away
the
widow
stamped
with
rage
i
sworn
to
do
it
you
got
to
suffer
my
fine
fellow
i
swore
to
dugrival
that
i
would
do
it
and
i
have
repeated
my
oath
every
morning
and
evening
since
i
have
taken
it
on
my
knees
yes
on
my
knees
before
heaven
that
listens
to
me
it
my
duty
and
my
right
to
revenge
my
dead
husband
by
the
way
lupin
you
do
look
quite
as
merry
as
you
did
lord
one
would
almost
think
you
were
afraid
he
afraid
he
afraid
i
can
see
it
in
his
eyes
come
along
gabriel
my
boy
look
at
his
eyes
look
at
his
lips
trembling
give
me
the
knife
so
that
i
may
dig
it
into
his
heart
while
he
shivering
oh
you
coward
quick
quick
gabriel
the
knife
i
ca
find
it
anywhere
said
the
young
man
running
back
in
dismay
it
has
gone
from
my
room
i
ca
make
it
out
never
mind
cried
the
widow
dugrival
half
demented
all
the
better
i
will
do
the
business
myself
she
seized
lupin
by
the
throat
clutched
him
with
her
ten
fingers
digging
her
nails
into
his
flesh
and
began
to
squeeze
with
all
her
might
lupin
uttered
a
hoarse
rattle
and
gave
himself
up
for
lost
suddenly
there
was
a
crash
at
the
window
one
of
the
panes
was
smashed
to
pieces
what
that
what
is
it
stammered
the
widow
drawing
herself
erect
in
alarm
gabriel
who
had
turned
even
paler
than
usual
murmured
i
do
know
i
ca
think
who
can
have
done
it
said
the
widow
she
dared
not
move
waiting
for
what
would
come
next
and
one
thing
above
all
terrified
her
the
fact
that
there
was
no
missile
on
the
floor
around
them
although
the
pane
of
glass
as
was
clearly
visible
had
given
way
before
the
crash
of
a
heavy
and
fairly
large
object
a
stone
probably
after
a
while
she
looked
under
the
bed
under
the
chest
of
drawers
nothing
she
said
no
said
her
nephew
who
was
also
looking
and
resuming
her
seat
she
said
i
feel
frightened
my
arms
fail
me
you
finish
him
off
gabriel
confessed
i
frightened
also
still
still
she
stammered
it
got
to
be
done
i
swore
it
making
one
last
effort
she
returned
to
lupin
and
gasped
his
neck
with
her
stiff
fingers
but
lupin
who
was
watching
her
pallid
face
received
a
very
clear
sensation
that
she
would
not
have
the
courage
to
kill
him
to
her
he
was
becoming
something
sacred
invulnerable
a
mysterious
power
was
protecting
him
against
every
attack
a
power
which
had
already
saved
him
three
times
by
inexplicable
means
and
which
would
find
other
means
to
protect
him
against
the
wiles
of
death
she
said
to
him
in
a
hoarse
voice
how
you
must
be
laughing
at
me
not
at
all
upon
my
word
i
should
feel
frightened
myself
in
your
place
nonsense
you
scum
of
the
earth
you
imagine
that
you
will
be
rescued
that
your
friends
are
waiting
outside
it
out
of
the
question
my
fine
fellow
i
know
it
not
they
defending
me
nobody
defending
me
well
then
well
all
the
same
there
something
strange
at
the
bottom
of
it
something
fantastic
and
miraculous
that
makes
your
flesh
creep
my
fine
lady
you
villain
you
be
laughing
on
the
other
side
of
your
mouth
before
long
i
doubt
it
you
wait
and
see
she
reflected
once
more
and
said
to
her
nephew
what
would
you
do
fasten
his
arm
again
and
let
be
off
he
replied
a
hideous
suggestion
it
meant
condemning
lupin
to
the
most
horrible
of
all
deaths
death
by
starvation
no
said
the
widow
he
might
still
find
a
means
of
escape
i
know
something
better
than
that
she
took
down
the
receiver
of
the
telephone
waited
and
asked
number
please
and
after
a
second
or
two
hullo
is
that
the
criminal
investigation
department
is
ganimard
there
in
twenty
minutes
you
say
sorry
however
when
he
comes
give
him
this
message
from
mme
dugrival
yes
mme
nicolas
dugrival
ask
him
to
come
to
my
flat
tell
him
to
open
the
door
of
my
wardrobe
and
when
he
has
done
so
he
will
see
that
the
wardrobe
hides
an
outlet
which
makes
my
bedroom
communicate
with
two
other
rooms
in
one
of
these
he
will
find
a
man
bound
hand
and
foot
it
is
the
thief
dugrival
murderer
you
do
believe
me
tell
ganimard
he
believe
me
right
enough
oh
i
was
almost
forgetting
to
give
you
the
man
name
arsène
lupin
and
without
another
word
she
replaced
the
receiver
there
lupin
that
done
after
all
i
would
just
as
soon
have
my
revenge
this
way
how
i
shall
hold
my
sides
when
i
read
the
reports
of
the
lupin
trial
are
you
coming
gabriel
yes
aunt
lupin
you
and
i
see
each
other
again
i
expect
for
we
are
going
abroad
but
i
promise
to
send
you
some
sweets
while
in
prison
chocolates
mother
we
eat
them
together
the
widow
went
out
with
her
nephew
leaving
lupin
fastened
down
to
the
bed
he
at
once
moved
his
free
arm
and
tried
to
release
himself
but
he
realized
at
the
first
attempt
that
he
would
never
have
the
strength
to
break
the
wire
strands
that
bound
him
exhausted
with
fever
and
pain
what
could
he
do
in
the
twenty
minutes
or
so
that
were
left
to
him
before
ganimard
arrival
nor
did
he
count
upon
his
friends
true
he
had
been
thrice
saved
from
death
but
this
was
evidently
due
to
an
astounding
series
of
accidents
and
not
to
any
interference
on
the
part
of
his
allies
otherwise
they
would
not
have
contented
themselves
with
these
extraordinary
manifestations
but
would
have
rescued
him
for
good
and
all
no
he
must
abandon
all
hope
ganimard
was
coming
ganimard
would
find
him
there
it
was
inevitable
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
and
the
prospect
of
what
was
coming
irritated
him
singularly
he
already
heard
his
old
enemy
gibes
ringing
in
his
ears
he
foresaw
the
roars
of
laughter
with
which
the
incredible
news
would
be
greeted
on
the
morrow
to
be
arrested
in
action
so
to
speak
on
the
battlefield
by
an
imposing
detachment
of
adversaries
was
one
thing
but
to
be
arrested
or
rather
picked
up
scraped
up
gathered
up
in
such
condition
was
really
too
silly
and
lupin
who
had
so
often
scoffed
at
others
felt
all
the
ridicule
that
was
falling
to
his
share
in
this
ending
of
the
dugrival
business
all
the
bathos
of
allowing
himself
to
be
caught
in
the
widow
infernal
trap
and
finally
of
being
served
up
to
the
police
like
a
dish
of
game
roasted
to
a
turn
and
nicely
seasoned
blow
the
widow
he
growled
i
had
rather
she
had
cut
my
throat
and
done
with
it
he
pricked
up
his
ears
some
one
was
moving
in
the
next
room
ganimard
no
great
as
his
eagerness
would
be
he
could
not
be
there
yet
besides
ganimard
would
not
have
acted
like
that
would
not
have
opened
the
door
as
gently
as
that
other
person
was
doing
what
other
person
lupin
remembered
the
three
miraculous
interventions
to
which
he
owed
his
life
was
it
possible
that
there
was
really
somebody
who
had
protected
him
against
the
widow
and
that
that
somebody
was
now
attempting
to
rescue
him
but
if
so
who
unseen
by
lupin
the
stranger
stooped
behind
the
bed
lupin
heard
the
sound
of
the
pliers
attacking
the
wire
strands
and
releasing
him
little
by
little
first
his
chest
was
freed
then
his
arms
then
his
legs
and
a
voice
said
to
him
you
must
get
up
and
dress
feeling
very
weak
he
himself
in
bed
at
the
moment
when
the
stranger
rose
from
her
stooping
posture
who
are
you
he
whispered
who
are
you
and
a
great
surprise
over
came
him
by
his
side
stood
a
woman
a
woman
dressed
in
black
with
a
lace
shawl
over
her
head
covering
part
of
her
face
and
the
woman
as
far
as
he
could
judge
was
young
and
of
a
graceful
and
slender
stature
who
are
you
he
repeated
you
must
come
now
said
the
woman
there
no
time
to
lose
can
i
asked
lupin
making
a
desperate
effort
i
doubt
if
i
have
the
strength
drink
this
she
poured
some
milk
into
a
cup
and
as
she
handed
it
to
him
her
lace
opened
leaving
the
face
uncovered
you
he
stammered
it
you
it
you
who
it
was
you
who
were
he
stared
in
amazement
at
this
woman
whose
features
presented
so
striking
a
resemblance
to
gabriel
whose
delicate
regular
face
had
the
same
pallor
whose
mouth
wore
the
same
hard
and
forbidding
expression
no
sister
could
have
borne
so
great
a
likeness
to
her
brother
there
was
not
a
doubt
possible
it
was
the
identical
person
and
without
believing
for
a
moment
that
gabriel
had
concealed
himself
in
a
woman
clothes
lupin
on
the
contrary
received
the
distinct
impression
that
it
was
a
woman
standing
beside
him
and
that
the
stripling
who
had
pursued
him
with
his
hatred
and
struck
him
with
the
dagger
was
in
very
deed
a
woman
in
order
to
follow
their
trade
with
greater
ease
the
dugrival
pair
had
accustomed
her
to
disguise
herself
as
a
boy
you
you
he
repeated
who
would
have
suspected
she
emptied
the
contents
of
a
phial
into
the
cup
drink
this
cordial
she
said
he
hesitated
thinking
of
poison
she
added
it
was
i
who
saved
you
of
course
of
course
he
said
it
was
you
who
removed
the
bullets
from
the
revolver
yes
and
you
who
hid
the
knife
here
it
is
in
my
pocket
and
you
who
smashed
the
while
your
aunt
was
throttling
me
yes
it
was
i
with
the
on
the
table
i
threw
it
into
the
street
but
why
why
he
asked
in
utter
amazement
drink
the
cordial
did
you
want
me
to
die
but
then
why
did
you
stab
me
to
begin
with
drink
the
cordial
he
emptied
the
cup
at
a
draught
without
quite
knowing
the
reason
of
his
sudden
confidence
dress
yourself
quickly
she
commanded
retiring
to
the
window
he
obeyed
and
she
came
back
to
him
for
he
had
dropped
into
a
chair
exhausted
we
must
go
now
we
must
we
have
only
just
time
collect
your
strength
she
bent
forward
a
little
so
that
he
might
lean
on
her
shoulder
and
turned
toward
the
door
and
the
staircase
and
lupin
walked
as
one
walks
in
a
dream
one
of
those
queer
dreams
in
which
the
most
inconsequent
things
occur
a
dream
that
was
the
happy
sequel
of
the
terrible
nightmare
in
which
he
had
lived
for
the
past
fortnight
a
thought
struck
him
however
he
began
to
laugh
poor
ganimard
upon
my
word
the
fellow
has
no
luck
i
would
give
twopence
to
see
him
coming
to
arrest
me
after
descending
the
staircase
with
the
aid
of
his
companion
who
supported
him
with
incredible
vigour
he
found
himself
in
the
street
opposite
a
into
which
she
helped
him
to
mount
right
away
she
said
to
the
driver
lupin
dazed
by
the
open
air
and
the
speed
at
which
they
were
travelling
hardly
took
stock
of
the
drive
and
of
the
incidents
on
the
road
he
recovered
all
his
consciousness
when
he
found
himself
at
home
in
one
of
the
flats
which
he
occupied
looked
after
by
his
servant
to
whom
the
girl
gave
a
few
rapid
instructions
you
can
go
he
said
to
the
man
but
when
the
girl
turned
to
go
as
well
he
held
her
back
by
a
fold
of
her
dress
no
no
you
must
first
explain
why
did
you
save
me
did
you
return
unknown
to
your
aunt
but
why
did
you
save
me
was
it
from
pity
she
did
not
answer
with
her
figure
drawn
up
and
her
head
flung
back
a
little
she
retained
her
hard
and
impenetrable
air
nevertheless
he
thought
he
noticed
that
the
lines
of
her
mouth
showed
not
so
much
cruelty
as
bitterness
her
eyes
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
revealed
melancholy
and
lupin
without
as
yet
understanding
received
a
vague
intuition
of
what
was
passing
within
her
he
seized
her
hand
she
pushed
him
away
with
a
start
of
revolt
in
which
he
felt
hatred
almost
repulsion
and
when
he
insisted
she
cried
let
me
be
will
you
let
me
be
ca
you
see
that
i
detest
you
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
lupin
disconcerted
she
quivering
and
full
of
uneasiness
her
pale
face
all
flushed
with
unwonted
colour
he
said
to
her
gently
if
you
detested
me
you
should
have
let
me
die
it
was
simple
enough
why
did
you
why
why
how
do
i
know
her
face
contracted
with
a
sudden
movement
she
hid
it
in
her
two
hands
and
he
saw
tears
trickle
between
her
fingers
greatly
touched
he
thought
of
addressing
her
in
fond
words
such
as
one
would
use
to
a
little
girl
whom
one
wished
to
console
and
of
giving
her
good
advice
and
saving
her
in
his
turn
and
snatching
her
from
the
bad
life
which
she
was
leading
perhaps
against
her
better
nature
but
such
words
would
have
sounded
ridiculous
coming
from
his
lips
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
now
that
he
understood
the
whole
story
and
was
able
to
picture
the
young
woman
sitting
beside
his
nursing
the
man
whom
she
had
wounded
admiring
his
pluck
and
gaiety
becoming
attached
to
him
falling
in
love
with
him
and
thrice
over
probably
in
spite
of
herself
under
a
sort
of
instinctive
impulse
amid
fits
of
spite
and
rage
saving
him
from
death
and
all
this
was
so
strange
so
unforeseen
lupin
was
so
much
unmanned
by
his
astonishment
that
this
time
he
did
not
try
to
retain
her
when
she
made
for
the
door
backward
without
taking
her
eyes
from
him
she
lowered
her
head
smiled
for
an
instant
and
disappeared
he
rang
the
bell
quickly
follow
that
woman
he
said
to
his
man
or
no
stay
where
you
are
after
all
it
is
better
so
he
sat
brooding
for
a
while
possessed
by
the
girl
image
then
he
revolved
in
his
mind
all
that
curious
stirring
and
tragic
adventure
in
which
he
had
been
so
very
near
succumbing
and
taking
a
from
the
table
he
gazed
for
a
long
time
and
with
a
certain
at
his
features
which
illness
and
pain
had
not
succeeded
in
impairing
to
any
great
extent
good
looks
count
for
something
after
all
he
muttered
v
the
red
silk
scarf
on
leaving
his
house
one
morning
at
his
usual
early
hour
for
going
to
the
law
courts
ganimard
noticed
the
curious
behaviour
of
an
individual
who
was
walking
along
the
rue
pergolèse
in
front
of
him
shabbily
dressed
and
wearing
a
straw
hat
though
the
day
was
the
first
of
december
the
man
stooped
at
every
thirty
or
forty
yards
to
fasten
his
or
pick
up
his
stick
or
for
some
other
reason
and
each
time
he
took
a
little
piece
of
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
stealthily
on
the
kerb
of
the
pavement
it
was
probably
a
mere
display
of
eccentricity
a
childish
amusement
to
which
no
one
else
would
have
paid
attention
but
ganimard
was
one
of
those
shrewd
observers
who
are
indifferent
to
nothing
that
strikes
their
eyes
and
who
are
never
satisfied
until
they
know
the
secret
cause
of
things
he
therefore
began
to
follow
the
man
now
at
the
moment
when
the
fellow
was
turning
to
the
right
into
the
avenue
de
la
the
inspector
caught
him
exchanging
signals
with
a
boy
of
twelve
or
thirteen
who
was
walking
along
the
houses
on
the
side
twenty
yards
farther
the
man
stooped
and
turned
up
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
legs
a
bit
of
marked
the
place
at
the
same
moment
the
boy
stopped
and
with
a
piece
of
chalk
drew
a
white
cross
surrounded
by
a
circle
on
the
wall
of
the
house
next
to
him
the
two
continued
on
their
way
a
minute
later
a
fresh
halt
the
strange
individual
picked
up
a
pin
and
dropped
a
piece
of
and
the
boy
at
once
made
a
second
cross
on
the
wall
and
again
drew
a
white
circle
round
it
by
jove
thought
the
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
this
is
rather
promising
what
on
earth
can
those
two
merchants
be
plotting
the
two
merchants
went
down
the
avenue
friedland
and
the
rue
du
but
nothing
occurred
that
was
worthy
of
special
mention
the
double
performance
was
repeated
at
almost
regular
intervals
and
so
to
speak
mechanically
nevertheless
it
was
obvious
on
the
one
hand
that
the
man
with
the
did
not
do
his
part
of
the
business
until
after
he
had
picked
out
with
a
glance
the
house
that
was
to
be
marked
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
boy
did
not
mark
that
particular
house
until
after
he
had
observed
his
companion
signal
it
was
certain
therefore
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
two
and
the
proceedings
presented
no
small
interest
in
the
eyes
at
the
place
beauveau
the
man
hesitated
then
apparently
making
up
his
mind
he
twice
turned
up
and
twice
turned
down
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
legs
hereupon
the
boy
sat
down
on
the
kerb
opposite
the
sentry
who
was
mounting
guard
outside
the
ministry
of
the
interior
and
marked
the
flagstone
with
two
little
crosses
contained
within
two
circles
the
same
ceremony
was
gone
through
a
little
further
on
when
they
reached
the
elysée
only
on
the
pavement
where
the
sentry
was
marching
up
and
down
there
were
three
signs
instead
of
two
hang
it
all
muttered
ganimard
pale
with
excitement
and
thinking
in
spite
of
himself
of
his
inveterate
enemy
lupin
whose
name
came
to
his
mind
whenever
a
mysterious
circumstance
presented
itself
hang
it
all
what
does
it
mean
he
was
nearly
collaring
and
questioning
the
two
merchants
but
he
was
too
clever
to
commit
so
gross
a
blunder
the
man
with
the
had
now
lit
a
cigarette
and
the
boy
also
placing
a
between
his
lips
had
gone
up
to
him
apparently
with
the
object
of
asking
for
a
light
they
exchanged
a
few
words
quick
as
thought
the
boy
handed
his
companion
an
object
which
looked
at
least
so
the
inspector
believed
like
a
revolver
they
both
bent
over
this
object
and
the
man
standing
with
his
face
to
the
wall
put
his
hand
six
times
in
his
pocket
and
made
a
movement
as
though
he
were
loading
a
weapon
as
soon
as
this
was
done
they
walked
briskly
to
the
rue
de
surène
and
the
inspector
who
followed
them
as
closely
as
he
was
able
to
do
without
attracting
their
attention
saw
them
enter
the
gateway
of
an
old
house
of
which
all
the
shutters
were
closed
with
the
exception
of
those
on
the
third
or
top
floor
he
hurried
in
after
them
at
the
end
of
the
he
saw
a
large
courtyard
with
a
sign
at
the
back
and
a
staircase
on
the
left
he
went
up
the
stairs
and
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
first
floor
ran
still
faster
because
he
heard
right
up
at
the
top
a
din
as
of
a
when
he
came
to
the
last
landing
he
found
the
door
open
he
entered
listened
for
a
second
caught
the
sound
of
a
struggle
rushed
to
the
room
from
which
the
sound
appeared
to
proceed
and
remained
standing
on
the
threshold
very
much
out
of
breath
and
greatly
surprised
to
see
the
man
of
the
and
the
boy
banging
the
floor
with
chairs
at
that
moment
a
third
person
walked
out
of
an
adjoining
room
it
was
a
young
man
of
or
thirty
wearing
a
pair
of
short
whiskers
in
addition
to
his
moustache
spectacles
and
a
with
an
astrakhan
collar
and
looking
like
a
foreigner
a
russian
good
morning
ganimard
he
said
and
turning
to
the
two
companions
thank
you
my
friends
and
all
my
congratulations
on
the
successful
result
here
the
reward
i
promised
you
he
gave
them
a
note
pushed
them
outside
and
shut
both
doors
i
am
sorry
old
chap
he
said
to
ganimard
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
wanted
to
talk
to
you
badly
he
offered
him
his
hand
and
seeing
that
the
inspector
remained
flabbergasted
and
that
his
face
was
still
distorted
with
anger
he
exclaimed
why
you
do
seem
to
understand
and
yet
it
clear
enough
i
wanted
to
see
you
particularly
so
what
could
i
do
and
pretending
to
reply
to
an
objection
no
no
old
chap
he
continued
quite
wrong
if
i
had
written
or
telephoned
you
would
not
have
come
or
else
you
would
have
come
with
a
regiment
now
i
wanted
to
see
you
all
alone
and
i
thought
the
best
thing
was
to
send
those
two
decent
fellows
to
meet
you
with
orders
to
scatter
bits
of
and
draw
crosses
and
circles
in
short
to
mark
out
your
road
to
this
place
why
you
look
quite
bewildered
what
is
it
perhaps
you
do
recognize
me
lupin
arsène
lupin
ransack
your
memory
does
the
name
remind
you
of
anything
you
dirty
scoundrel
ganimard
snarled
between
his
teeth
lupin
seemed
greatly
distressed
and
in
an
affectionate
voice
are
you
vexed
yes
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
the
dugrival
business
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
waited
for
you
to
come
and
take
me
in
charge
there
now
the
thought
never
occurred
to
me
i
promise
you
next
time
you
scum
of
the
earth
growled
ganimard
and
i
thinking
i
was
giving
you
a
treat
upon
my
word
i
did
i
said
to
myself
dear
old
ganimard
we
have
met
for
an
age
he
simply
rush
at
me
when
he
sees
me
ganimard
who
had
not
yet
stirred
a
limb
seemed
to
be
waking
from
his
stupor
he
looked
around
him
looked
at
lupin
visibly
asked
himself
whether
he
would
not
do
well
to
rush
at
him
in
reality
and
then
controlling
himself
took
hold
of
a
chair
and
settled
himself
in
it
as
though
he
had
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
listen
to
his
enemy
speak
he
said
and
do
waste
my
time
with
any
nonsense
i
in
a
hurry
that
it
said
lupin
let
talk
you
ca
imagine
a
quieter
place
than
this
it
an
old
which
once
stood
in
the
open
country
and
it
belongs
to
the
duc
de
rochelaure
the
duke
who
has
never
lived
in
it
lets
this
floor
to
me
and
the
outhouses
to
a
painter
and
decorator
i
always
keep
up
a
few
establishments
of
this
kind
a
sound
practical
plan
here
in
spite
of
my
looking
like
a
russian
nobleman
i
am
daubreuil
an
you
understand
i
had
to
select
a
rather
overstocked
profession
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
do
you
think
i
care
a
hang
about
all
this
said
ganimard
interrupting
him
quite
right
i
wasting
words
and
you
in
a
hurry
forgive
me
i
be
long
now
five
minutes
that
all
i
start
at
once
have
a
cigar
no
very
well
no
more
will
i
he
sat
down
also
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
table
while
thinking
and
began
in
this
fashion
on
the
of
october
on
a
warm
and
sunny
autumn
day
do
you
follow
me
but
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
is
it
really
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
reign
of
henry
iv
and
tell
you
all
about
the
building
of
the
no
i
do
suppose
you
are
very
well
up
in
french
history
and
i
should
only
end
by
muddling
you
suffice
it
then
for
you
to
know
that
last
night
at
one
in
the
morning
a
boatman
passing
under
the
last
arch
of
the
aforesaid
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
heard
something
drop
into
the
front
part
of
his
barge
the
thing
had
been
flung
from
the
bridge
and
its
evident
destination
was
the
bottom
of
the
seine
the
bargee
dog
rushed
forward
barking
and
when
the
man
reached
the
end
of
his
craft
he
saw
the
animal
worrying
a
piece
of
newspaper
that
had
served
to
wrap
up
a
number
of
objects
he
took
from
the
dog
such
of
the
contents
as
had
not
fallen
into
the
water
went
to
his
cabin
and
examined
them
carefully
the
result
struck
him
as
interesting
and
as
the
man
is
connected
with
one
of
my
friends
he
sent
to
let
me
know
this
morning
i
was
waked
up
and
placed
in
possession
of
the
facts
and
of
the
objects
which
the
man
had
collected
here
they
are
he
pointed
to
them
spread
out
on
a
table
there
were
first
of
all
the
torn
pieces
of
a
newspaper
next
came
a
large
inkstand
with
a
long
piece
of
string
fastened
to
the
lid
there
was
a
bit
of
broken
glass
and
a
sort
of
flexible
cardboard
reduced
to
shreds
lastly
there
was
a
piece
of
bright
scarlet
silk
ending
in
a
tassel
of
the
same
material
and
colour
you
see
our
exhibits
friend
of
my
youth
said
lupin
no
doubt
the
problem
would
be
more
easily
solved
if
we
had
the
other
objects
which
went
overboard
owing
to
the
stupidity
of
the
dog
but
it
seems
to
me
all
the
same
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
with
a
little
reflection
and
intelligence
and
those
are
just
your
great
qualities
how
does
the
business
strike
you
ganimard
did
not
move
a
muscle
he
was
willing
to
stand
lupin
chaff
but
his
dignity
commanded
him
not
to
speak
a
single
word
in
answer
nor
even
to
give
a
nod
or
shake
of
the
head
that
might
have
been
taken
to
express
approval
or
or
criticism
i
see
that
we
are
entirely
of
one
mind
continued
lupin
without
appearing
to
remark
the
silence
and
i
can
sum
up
the
matter
briefly
as
told
us
by
these
exhibits
yesterday
evening
between
nine
and
twelve
a
showily
dressed
young
woman
was
wounded
with
a
knife
and
then
caught
round
the
throat
and
choked
to
death
by
a
gentleman
wearing
a
single
eyeglass
and
interested
in
racing
with
whom
the
aforesaid
showily
dressed
young
lady
had
been
eating
three
meringues
and
a
coffee
éclair
lupin
lit
a
cigarette
and
taking
ganimard
by
the
sleeve
aha
that
up
against
you
you
thought
that
in
the
domain
of
police
deductions
such
feats
as
those
were
prohibited
to
outsiders
wrong
sir
lupin
juggles
with
inferences
and
deductions
for
all
the
world
like
a
detective
in
a
novel
my
proofs
are
dazzling
and
absolutely
simple
and
pointing
to
the
objects
one
by
one
as
he
demonstrated
his
statement
he
resumed
i
said
after
nine
yesterday
evening
this
scrap
of
newspaper
bears
yesterday
date
with
the
words
edition
also
you
will
see
here
pasted
to
the
paper
a
bit
of
one
of
those
yellow
wrappers
in
which
the
subscribers
copies
are
sent
out
these
copies
are
always
delivered
by
the
nine
post
therefore
it
was
after
nine
i
said
a
man
please
observe
that
this
tiny
piece
of
glass
has
the
round
hole
of
a
single
eyeglass
at
one
of
the
edges
and
that
the
single
eyeglass
is
an
essentially
aristocratic
article
of
wear
this
man
walked
into
a
shop
here
is
the
very
thin
cardboard
shaped
like
a
box
and
still
showing
a
little
of
the
cream
of
the
meringues
and
éclairs
which
were
packed
in
it
in
the
usual
way
having
got
his
parcel
the
gentleman
with
the
eyeglass
joined
a
young
person
whose
eccentricity
in
the
matter
of
dress
is
pretty
clearly
indicated
by
this
silk
scarf
having
joined
her
for
some
reason
as
yet
unknown
he
first
stabbed
her
with
a
knife
and
then
strangled
her
with
the
help
of
this
same
scarf
take
your
magnifying
glass
and
you
will
see
on
the
silk
stains
of
a
darker
red
which
are
here
the
marks
of
a
knife
wiped
on
the
scarf
and
there
the
marks
of
a
hand
covered
with
blood
clutching
the
material
having
committed
the
murder
his
next
business
is
to
leave
no
trace
behind
him
so
he
takes
from
his
pocket
first
the
newspaper
to
which
he
subscribes
a
as
you
will
see
by
glancing
at
the
contents
of
this
scrap
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
discovering
the
title
and
secondly
a
cord
which
on
inspection
turns
out
to
be
a
length
of
these
two
details
prove
do
they
not
that
our
man
is
interested
in
racing
and
that
he
himself
rides
next
he
picks
up
the
fragments
of
his
eyeglass
the
cord
of
which
has
been
broken
in
the
struggle
he
takes
a
pair
of
scissors
observe
the
hacking
of
the
scissors
and
cuts
off
the
stained
part
of
the
scarf
leaving
the
other
end
no
doubt
in
his
victim
clenched
hands
he
makes
a
ball
of
the
confectioner
cardboard
box
he
also
puts
in
certain
things
that
would
have
betrayed
him
such
as
the
knife
which
must
have
slipped
into
the
seine
he
wraps
everything
in
the
newspaper
ties
it
with
the
cord
and
fastens
this
inkstand
to
it
as
a
then
he
makes
himself
scarce
a
little
later
the
parcel
falls
into
the
barge
and
there
you
are
oof
it
hot
work
what
do
you
say
to
the
story
he
looked
at
ganimard
to
see
what
impression
his
speech
had
produced
on
the
inspector
ganimard
did
not
depart
from
his
attitude
of
silence
lupin
began
to
laugh
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
annoyed
and
surprised
but
suspicious
as
well
should
that
confounded
lupin
hand
the
business
over
to
me
say
you
of
keeping
it
for
himself
hunting
down
the
murderer
and
rifling
his
pockets
if
there
was
a
robbery
the
question
is
quite
logical
of
course
but
there
is
a
i
have
no
time
you
see
i
am
full
up
with
work
at
the
present
moment
a
burglary
in
london
another
at
lausanne
an
exchange
of
children
at
marseilles
to
say
nothing
of
having
to
save
a
young
girl
who
is
at
this
moment
shadowed
by
death
that
always
the
way
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
so
i
said
to
myself
i
handed
the
business
over
to
my
dear
old
ganimard
now
that
it
is
for
him
he
is
quite
capable
of
succeeding
and
what
a
service
i
shall
be
doing
him
how
magnificently
he
will
be
able
to
distinguish
himself
no
sooner
said
than
done
at
eight
in
the
morning
i
sent
the
joker
with
the
to
meet
you
you
swallowed
the
bait
and
you
were
here
by
nine
all
on
edge
and
eager
for
the
fray
lupin
rose
from
his
chair
he
went
over
to
the
inspector
and
with
his
eyes
in
ganimard
said
that
all
you
now
know
the
whole
story
presently
you
will
know
the
victim
some
probably
some
singer
at
a
on
the
other
hand
the
chances
are
that
the
criminal
lives
near
the
most
likely
on
the
left
bank
lastly
here
are
all
the
exhibits
i
make
you
a
present
of
them
set
to
work
i
shall
only
keep
this
end
of
the
scarf
if
ever
you
want
to
piece
the
scarf
together
bring
me
the
other
end
the
one
which
the
police
will
find
round
the
victim
neck
bring
it
me
in
four
weeks
from
now
to
the
day
that
is
to
say
on
the
of
december
at
ten
in
the
morning
you
can
be
sure
of
finding
me
here
and
do
be
afraid
this
is
all
perfectly
serious
friend
of
my
youth
i
swear
it
is
no
humbug
honour
bright
you
can
go
straight
ahead
oh
by
the
way
when
you
arrest
the
fellow
with
the
eyeglass
be
a
bit
careful
he
is
old
dear
and
good
luck
to
you
lupin
spun
round
on
his
heel
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
disappeared
before
ganimard
had
even
thought
of
taking
a
decision
the
inspector
rushed
after
him
but
at
once
found
that
the
handle
of
the
door
by
some
trick
of
mechanism
which
he
did
not
know
refused
to
turn
it
took
him
ten
minutes
to
unscrew
the
lock
and
ten
minutes
more
to
unscrew
the
lock
of
the
by
the
time
that
he
had
scrambled
down
the
three
flights
of
stairs
ganimard
had
given
up
all
hope
of
catching
arsène
lupin
besides
he
was
not
thinking
of
it
lupin
inspired
him
with
a
queer
complex
feeling
made
up
of
fear
hatred
involuntary
admiration
and
also
the
vague
instinct
that
he
ganimard
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
in
spite
of
the
persistency
of
his
endeavours
would
never
get
the
better
of
this
particular
adversary
he
pursued
him
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
pride
but
with
the
continual
dread
of
being
taken
in
by
that
formidable
hoaxer
and
scouted
and
fooled
in
the
face
of
a
public
that
was
always
only
too
willing
to
laugh
at
the
mishaps
this
business
of
the
red
scarf
in
particular
struck
him
as
most
suspicious
it
was
interesting
certainly
in
more
ways
than
one
but
so
very
improbable
and
lupin
explanation
apparently
so
logical
would
never
stand
the
test
of
a
severe
examination
no
said
ganimard
this
is
all
swank
a
parcel
of
suppositions
and
guesswork
based
upon
nothing
at
all
i
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
when
he
reached
the
headquarters
of
police
at
quai
des
orfèvres
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
treat
the
incident
as
though
it
had
never
happened
he
went
up
to
the
criminal
investigation
department
here
one
of
his
said
seen
the
chief
no
he
was
asking
for
you
just
now
oh
was
he
yes
you
had
better
go
after
him
where
to
the
rue
de
berne
there
was
a
murder
there
last
night
oh
who
the
victim
i
do
know
exactly
a
singer
i
believe
ganimard
simply
muttered
by
jove
twenty
minutes
later
he
stepped
out
of
the
underground
and
made
for
the
rue
de
berne
the
victim
who
was
known
in
the
theatrical
world
by
her
of
jenny
saphir
occupied
a
small
flat
on
the
second
floor
of
one
of
the
houses
a
policeman
took
the
upstairs
and
showed
him
the
way
through
two
to
a
bedroom
where
he
found
the
magistrates
in
charge
of
the
inquiry
together
with
the
divisional
surgeon
and
dudouis
the
head
of
the
ganimard
started
at
the
first
glance
which
he
gave
into
the
room
he
saw
lying
on
a
sofa
the
corpse
of
a
young
woman
whose
hands
clutched
a
strip
of
red
silk
one
of
the
shoulders
which
appeared
above
the
bodice
bore
the
marks
of
two
wounds
surrounded
with
clotted
blood
the
distorted
and
almost
blackened
features
still
bore
an
expression
of
frenzied
terror
the
divisional
surgeon
who
had
just
finished
his
examination
said
my
first
conclusions
are
very
clear
the
victim
was
twice
stabbed
with
a
dagger
and
afterward
strangled
the
immediate
cause
of
death
was
asphyxia
by
jove
thought
ganimard
again
remembering
lupin
words
and
the
picture
which
he
had
drawn
of
the
crime
the
objected
but
the
neck
shows
no
discoloration
she
may
have
been
strangled
with
a
napkin
or
a
handkerchief
said
the
doctor
most
probably
said
the
chief
detective
with
this
silk
scarf
which
the
victim
was
wearing
and
a
piece
of
which
remains
as
though
she
had
clung
to
it
with
her
two
hands
to
protect
herself
but
why
does
only
that
piece
remain
asked
the
magistrate
what
has
become
of
the
other
the
other
may
have
been
stained
with
blood
and
carried
off
by
the
murderer
you
can
plainly
distinguish
the
hurried
slashing
of
the
scissors
by
jove
said
ganimard
between
his
teeth
for
the
third
time
that
brute
of
a
lupin
saw
everything
without
seeing
a
thing
and
what
about
the
motive
of
the
murder
asked
the
magistrate
the
locks
have
been
forced
the
cupboards
turned
upside
down
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
m
dudouis
the
chief
of
the
replied
i
can
at
least
suggest
a
supposition
derived
from
the
statements
made
by
the
servant
the
victim
who
enjoyed
a
greater
reputation
on
account
of
her
looks
than
through
her
talent
as
a
singer
went
to
russia
two
years
ago
and
brought
back
with
her
a
magnificent
sapphire
which
she
appears
to
have
received
from
some
person
of
importance
at
the
court
since
then
she
went
by
the
name
of
jenny
saphir
and
seems
generally
to
have
been
very
proud
of
that
present
although
for
prudence
sake
she
never
wore
it
i
daresay
that
we
shall
not
be
far
out
if
we
presume
the
theft
of
the
sapphire
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
crime
but
did
the
maid
know
where
the
stone
was
no
nobody
did
and
the
disorder
of
the
room
would
tend
to
prove
that
the
murderer
did
not
know
either
we
will
question
the
maid
said
the
dudouis
took
the
aside
and
said
you
looking
very
ganimard
what
the
matter
do
you
suspect
anything
nothing
at
all
chief
that
a
pity
we
could
do
with
a
bit
of
showy
work
in
the
department
this
is
one
of
a
number
of
crimes
all
of
the
same
class
of
which
we
have
failed
to
discover
the
perpetrator
this
time
we
want
the
criminal
and
quickly
a
difficult
job
chief
it
got
to
be
done
listen
to
me
ganimard
according
to
what
the
maid
says
jenny
saphir
led
a
very
regular
life
for
a
month
past
she
was
in
the
habit
of
frequently
receiving
visits
on
her
return
from
the
that
is
to
say
at
about
ten
from
a
man
who
would
stay
until
midnight
or
so
a
society
man
jenny
saphir
used
to
say
he
wants
to
marry
me
this
society
man
took
every
precaution
to
avoid
being
seen
such
as
turning
up
his
and
lowering
the
brim
of
his
hat
when
he
passed
the
porter
box
and
jenny
saphir
always
made
a
point
of
sending
away
her
maid
even
before
he
came
this
is
the
man
whom
we
have
to
find
has
he
left
no
traces
none
at
all
it
is
obvious
that
we
have
to
deal
with
a
very
clever
scoundrel
who
prepared
his
crime
beforehand
and
committed
it
with
every
possible
chance
of
escaping
unpunished
his
arrest
would
be
a
great
feather
in
our
cap
i
rely
on
you
ganimard
ah
you
rely
on
me
chief
replied
the
inspector
well
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
i
do
say
no
only
he
seemed
in
a
very
nervous
condition
and
his
agitation
struck
dudouis
only
continued
ganimard
only
i
swear
do
you
hear
chief
i
swear
what
do
you
swear
nothing
we
shall
see
chief
we
shall
see
ganimard
did
not
finish
his
sentence
until
he
was
outside
alone
and
he
finished
it
aloud
stamping
his
foot
in
a
tone
of
the
most
violent
anger
only
i
swear
to
heaven
that
the
arrest
shall
be
effected
by
my
own
means
without
my
employing
a
single
one
of
the
clues
with
which
that
villain
has
supplied
me
ah
no
ah
no
railing
against
lupin
furious
at
being
mixed
up
in
this
business
and
resolved
nevertheless
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
streets
his
brain
was
seething
with
irritation
and
he
tried
to
adjust
his
ideas
a
little
and
to
discover
among
the
chaotic
facts
some
trifling
detail
unperceived
by
all
unsuspected
by
lupin
himself
that
might
lead
him
to
success
he
lunched
hurriedly
at
a
bar
resumed
his
stroll
and
suddenly
stopped
petrified
astounded
and
confused
he
was
walking
under
the
gateway
of
the
very
house
in
the
rue
de
surène
to
which
lupin
had
enticed
him
a
few
hours
earlier
a
force
stronger
than
his
own
will
was
drawing
him
there
once
more
the
solution
of
the
problem
lay
there
there
and
there
alone
were
all
the
elements
of
the
truth
do
and
say
what
he
would
assertions
were
so
precise
his
calculations
so
accurate
that
worried
to
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
being
by
so
prodigious
a
display
of
perspicacity
he
could
not
do
other
than
take
up
the
work
at
the
point
where
his
enemy
had
left
it
abandoning
all
further
resistance
he
climbed
the
three
flights
of
stairs
the
door
of
the
flat
was
open
no
one
had
touched
the
exhibits
he
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
walked
away
from
that
moment
he
reasoned
and
acted
so
to
speak
mechanically
under
the
influence
of
the
master
whom
he
could
not
choose
but
obey
admitting
that
the
unknown
person
whom
he
was
seeking
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
it
became
necessary
to
discover
somewhere
between
that
bridge
and
the
rue
de
berne
the
confectioner
shop
open
in
the
evenings
at
which
the
cakes
were
bought
this
did
not
take
long
to
find
a
near
the
gare
showed
him
some
little
cardboard
boxes
identical
in
material
and
shape
with
the
one
in
ganimard
possession
moreover
one
of
the
remembered
having
served
on
the
previous
evening
a
gentleman
whose
face
was
almost
concealed
in
the
collar
of
his
fur
coat
but
whose
eyeglass
she
had
happened
to
notice
that
one
clue
checked
thought
the
inspector
our
man
wears
an
eyeglass
he
next
collected
the
pieces
of
the
and
showed
them
to
a
newsvendor
who
easily
recognized
the
ganimard
at
once
went
to
the
offices
of
the
and
asked
to
see
the
list
of
subscribers
going
through
the
list
he
jotted
down
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
those
who
lived
anywhere
near
the
and
principally
because
lupin
had
said
so
those
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
he
then
went
back
to
the
criminal
investigation
department
took
half
a
dozen
men
and
packed
them
off
with
the
necessary
instructions
at
seven
in
the
evening
the
last
of
these
men
returned
and
brought
good
news
with
him
a
certain
prévailles
a
subscriber
to
the
occupied
an
entresol
flat
on
the
quai
des
augustins
on
the
previous
evening
he
left
his
place
wearing
a
fur
coat
took
his
letters
and
his
paper
the
from
the
porter
wife
walked
away
and
returned
home
at
midnight
this
prévailles
wore
a
single
eyeglass
he
was
a
regular
and
himself
owned
several
hacks
which
he
either
rode
himself
or
jobbed
out
the
inquiry
had
taken
so
short
a
time
and
the
results
obtained
were
so
exactly
in
accordance
with
lupin
predictions
that
ganimard
felt
quite
overcome
on
hearing
the
detective
report
once
more
he
was
measuring
the
prodigious
extent
of
the
resources
at
lupin
disposal
never
in
the
course
of
his
life
and
ganimard
was
already
in
years
had
he
come
across
such
perspicacity
such
a
quick
and
mind
he
went
in
search
of
dudouis
everything
ready
chief
have
you
a
warrant
eh
i
said
everything
is
ready
for
the
arrest
chief
you
know
the
name
of
jenny
saphir
murderer
yes
but
how
explain
yourself
ganimard
had
a
sort
of
scruple
of
conscience
blushed
a
little
and
nevertheless
replied
an
accident
chief
the
murderer
threw
everything
that
was
likely
to
compromise
him
into
the
seine
part
of
the
parcel
was
picked
up
and
handed
to
me
by
whom
a
boatman
who
refused
to
give
his
name
for
fear
of
getting
into
trouble
but
i
had
all
the
clues
i
wanted
it
was
not
so
difficult
as
i
expected
and
the
inspector
described
how
he
had
gone
to
work
and
you
call
that
an
accident
cried
dudouis
and
you
say
that
it
was
not
difficult
why
it
one
of
your
finest
performances
finish
it
yourself
ganimard
and
be
prudent
ganimard
was
eager
to
get
the
business
done
he
went
to
the
quai
des
augustins
with
his
men
and
distributed
them
around
the
house
he
questioned
the
portress
who
said
that
her
tenant
took
his
meals
out
of
doors
but
made
a
point
of
looking
in
after
dinner
a
little
before
nine
in
fact
leaning
out
of
her
window
she
warned
ganimard
who
at
once
gave
a
low
whistle
a
gentleman
in
a
tall
hat
and
a
fur
coat
was
coming
along
the
pavement
beside
the
seine
he
crossed
the
road
and
walked
up
to
the
house
ganimard
stepped
forward
prévailles
i
believe
yes
but
who
are
you
i
have
a
commission
to
he
had
not
time
to
finish
his
sentence
at
the
sight
of
the
men
appearing
out
of
the
shadow
prévailles
quickly
retreated
to
the
wall
and
faced
his
adversaries
with
his
back
to
the
door
of
a
shop
on
the
the
shutters
of
which
were
closed
stand
back
he
cried
i
do
know
you
his
right
hand
brandished
a
heavy
stick
while
his
left
was
slipped
behind
him
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
open
the
door
ganimard
had
an
impression
that
the
man
might
escape
through
this
way
and
through
some
secret
outlet
none
of
this
nonsense
he
said
moving
closer
to
him
caught
you
had
better
come
quietly
but
just
as
he
was
laying
hold
of
prévailles
stick
ganimard
remembered
the
warning
which
lupin
gave
him
prévailles
was
and
it
was
his
revolver
for
which
he
was
feeling
behind
his
back
the
inspector
ducked
his
head
he
had
noticed
the
man
sudden
movement
two
reports
rang
out
no
one
was
hit
a
second
later
prévailles
received
a
blow
under
the
chin
from
the
of
a
revolver
which
brought
him
down
where
he
stood
he
was
entered
at
the
dépôt
soon
after
nine
ganimard
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
even
at
that
time
but
this
capture
so
quickly
effected
by
such
very
simple
means
and
at
once
made
public
by
the
police
won
him
a
sudden
celebrity
prévailles
was
forthwith
saddled
with
all
the
murders
that
had
remained
unpunished
and
the
newspapers
vied
with
one
another
in
extolling
ganimard
prowess
the
case
was
conducted
briskly
at
the
start
it
was
first
of
all
ascertained
that
prévailles
whose
real
name
was
thomas
derocq
had
already
been
in
trouble
moreover
the
search
instituted
in
his
rooms
while
not
supplying
any
fresh
proofs
at
least
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
ball
of
similar
to
the
cord
used
for
doing
up
the
parcel
and
also
to
the
discovery
of
daggers
which
would
have
produced
a
wound
similar
to
the
wounds
on
the
victim
but
on
the
eighth
day
everything
was
changed
until
then
prévailles
had
refused
to
reply
to
the
questions
put
to
him
but
now
assisted
by
his
counsel
he
pleaded
a
circumstantial
alibi
and
maintained
that
he
was
at
the
on
the
night
of
the
murder
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
pockets
of
his
contained
the
counterfoil
of
a
and
a
programme
of
the
performance
both
bearing
the
date
of
that
evening
an
alibi
prepared
in
advance
objected
the
prove
it
said
prévailles
the
prisoner
was
confronted
with
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
the
young
lady
from
the
confectioner
thought
she
knew
the
gentleman
with
the
eyeglass
the
in
the
rue
de
berne
thought
he
knew
the
gentleman
who
used
to
come
to
see
jenny
saphir
but
nobody
dared
to
make
a
more
definite
statement
the
examination
therefore
led
to
nothing
of
a
precise
character
provided
no
solid
basis
whereon
to
found
a
serious
accusation
the
judge
sent
for
ganimard
and
told
him
of
his
difficulty
i
ca
possibly
persist
at
this
rate
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
charge
but
surely
you
are
convinced
in
your
own
mind
monsieur
le
juge
prévailles
would
never
have
resisted
his
arrest
unless
he
was
guilty
he
says
that
he
thought
he
was
being
assaulted
he
also
says
that
he
never
set
eyes
on
jenny
saphir
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
can
find
no
one
to
contradict
his
assertion
then
again
admitting
that
the
sapphire
has
been
stolen
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
at
his
flat
nor
anywhere
else
suggested
ganimard
quite
true
but
that
is
no
evidence
against
him
i
tell
you
what
we
shall
want
ganimard
and
that
very
soon
the
other
end
of
this
red
scarf
the
other
end
yes
for
it
is
obvious
that
if
the
murderer
took
it
away
with
him
the
reason
was
that
the
stuff
is
stained
with
the
marks
of
the
blood
on
his
fingers
ganimard
made
no
reply
for
several
days
he
had
felt
that
the
whole
business
was
tending
to
this
conclusion
there
was
no
other
proof
possible
given
the
silk
scarf
and
in
no
other
circumstances
prévailles
guilt
was
certain
now
ganimard
position
required
that
prévailles
guilt
should
be
established
he
was
responsible
for
the
arrest
it
had
cast
a
glamour
around
him
he
had
been
praised
to
the
skies
as
the
most
formidable
adversary
of
criminals
and
he
would
look
absolutely
ridiculous
if
prévailles
were
released
unfortunately
the
one
and
only
indispensable
proof
was
in
pocket
how
was
he
to
get
hold
of
it
ganimard
cast
about
exhausted
himself
with
fresh
investigations
went
over
the
inquiry
from
start
to
finish
spent
sleepless
nights
in
turning
over
the
mystery
of
the
rue
de
berne
studied
the
records
of
life
sent
ten
men
hunting
after
the
invisible
sapphire
everything
was
useless
on
the
of
december
the
stopped
him
in
one
of
the
passages
of
the
law
courts
well
ganimard
any
news
no
monsieur
le
juge
then
i
shall
dismiss
the
case
wait
one
day
longer
what
the
use
we
want
the
other
end
of
the
scarf
have
you
got
it
i
shall
have
it
yes
but
please
lend
me
the
piece
in
your
possession
what
if
i
do
if
you
do
i
promise
to
let
you
have
the
whole
scarf
complete
very
well
that
understood
ganimard
followed
the
to
his
room
and
came
out
with
the
piece
of
silk
hang
it
all
he
growled
yes
i
will
go
and
fetch
the
proof
and
i
shall
have
it
too
always
presuming
that
master
lupin
has
the
courage
to
keep
the
appointment
in
point
of
fact
he
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
master
lupin
would
have
this
courage
and
that
was
just
what
exasperated
him
why
had
lupin
insisted
on
this
meeting
what
was
his
object
in
the
circumstances
anxious
furious
and
full
of
hatred
he
resolved
to
take
every
precaution
necessary
not
only
to
prevent
his
falling
into
a
trap
himself
but
to
make
his
enemy
fall
into
one
now
that
the
opportunity
offered
and
on
the
next
day
which
was
the
of
december
the
date
fixed
by
lupin
after
spending
the
night
in
studying
the
old
in
the
rue
de
surène
and
convincing
himself
that
there
was
no
other
outlet
than
the
front
door
he
warned
his
men
that
he
was
going
on
a
dangerous
expedition
and
arrived
with
them
on
the
field
of
battle
he
posted
them
in
a
café
and
gave
them
formal
instructions
if
he
showed
himself
at
one
of
the
windows
or
if
he
failed
to
return
within
an
hour
the
detectives
were
to
enter
the
house
and
arrest
any
one
who
tried
to
leave
it
the
made
sure
that
his
revolver
was
in
working
order
and
that
he
could
take
it
from
his
pocket
easily
then
he
went
upstairs
he
was
surprised
to
find
things
as
he
had
left
them
the
doors
open
and
the
locks
broken
after
ascertaining
that
the
windows
of
the
principal
room
looked
out
on
the
street
he
visited
the
three
other
rooms
that
made
up
the
flat
there
was
no
one
there
master
lupin
was
afraid
he
muttered
not
without
a
certain
satisfaction
do
be
silly
said
a
voice
behind
him
turning
round
he
saw
an
old
workman
wearing
a
long
smock
standing
in
the
doorway
you
need
bother
your
head
said
the
man
it
i
lupin
i
have
been
working
in
the
painter
shop
since
early
morning
this
is
when
we
knock
off
for
breakfast
so
i
came
upstairs
he
looked
at
ganimard
with
a
quizzing
smile
and
cried
my
word
this
is
a
gorgeous
moment
i
owe
you
old
chap
i
sell
it
for
ten
years
of
your
life
and
yet
you
know
how
i
love
you
what
do
you
think
of
it
artist
was
it
well
thought
out
and
well
foreseen
foreseen
from
alpha
to
omega
did
i
understand
the
business
did
i
penetrate
the
mystery
of
the
scarf
i
not
saying
that
there
were
no
holes
in
my
argument
no
links
missing
in
the
chain
but
what
a
masterpiece
of
intelligence
ganimard
what
a
reconstruction
of
events
what
an
intuition
of
everything
that
had
taken
place
and
of
everything
that
was
going
to
take
place
from
the
discovery
of
the
crime
to
your
arrival
here
in
search
of
a
proof
what
really
marvellous
divination
have
you
the
scarf
yes
half
of
it
have
you
the
other
here
it
is
let
compare
they
spread
the
two
pieces
of
silk
on
the
table
the
cuts
made
by
the
scissors
corresponded
exactly
moreover
the
colours
were
identical
but
i
presume
said
lupin
that
this
was
not
the
only
thing
you
came
for
what
you
are
interested
in
seeing
is
the
marks
of
the
blood
come
with
me
ganimard
it
rather
dark
in
here
they
moved
into
the
next
room
which
though
it
overlooked
the
courtyard
was
lighter
and
lupin
held
his
piece
of
silk
against
the
look
he
said
making
room
for
ganimard
the
inspector
gave
a
start
of
delight
the
marks
of
the
five
fingers
and
the
print
of
the
palm
were
distinctly
visible
the
evidence
was
undeniable
the
murderer
had
seized
the
stuff
in
his
bloodstained
hand
in
the
same
hand
that
had
stabbed
jenny
saphir
and
tied
the
scarf
round
her
neck
and
it
is
the
print
of
a
left
hand
observed
lupin
hence
my
warning
which
had
nothing
miraculous
about
it
you
see
for
though
i
admit
friend
of
my
youth
that
you
may
look
upon
me
as
a
superior
intelligence
i
wo
have
you
treat
me
as
a
wizard
ganimard
had
quickly
pocketed
the
piece
of
silk
lupin
nodded
his
head
in
approval
quite
right
old
boy
it
for
you
i
so
glad
you
glad
and
you
see
there
was
no
trap
about
all
this
only
the
wish
to
oblige
a
service
between
friends
between
pals
and
also
i
confess
a
little
curiosity
yes
i
wanted
to
examine
this
other
piece
of
silk
the
one
the
police
had
do
be
afraid
i
give
it
back
to
you
just
a
second
lupin
with
a
careless
movement
played
with
the
tassel
at
the
end
of
this
half
of
the
scarf
while
ganimard
listened
to
him
in
spite
of
himself
how
ingenious
these
little
bits
of
women
work
are
did
you
notice
one
detail
in
the
maid
evidence
jenny
saphir
was
very
handy
with
her
needle
and
used
to
make
all
her
own
hats
and
frocks
it
is
obvious
that
she
made
this
scarf
herself
besides
i
noticed
that
from
the
first
i
am
naturally
curious
as
i
have
already
told
you
and
i
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
piece
of
silk
which
you
have
just
put
in
your
pocket
inside
the
tassel
i
found
a
little
sacred
medal
which
the
poor
girl
had
stitched
into
it
to
bring
her
luck
touching
is
it
ganimard
a
little
medal
of
our
lady
of
good
succour
the
inspector
felt
greatly
puzzled
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
other
and
lupin
continued
then
i
said
to
myself
interesting
it
would
be
to
explore
the
other
half
of
the
scarf
the
one
which
the
police
will
find
round
the
victim
neck
for
this
other
half
which
i
hold
in
my
hands
at
last
is
finished
off
in
the
same
way
so
i
shall
be
able
to
see
if
it
has
a
too
and
what
inside
it
but
look
my
friend
it
cleverly
made
and
so
simple
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
take
a
skein
of
red
cord
and
braid
it
round
a
wooden
cup
leaving
a
little
recess
a
little
empty
space
in
the
middle
very
small
of
course
but
large
enough
to
hold
a
medal
of
a
saint
or
anything
a
precious
stone
for
instance
such
as
a
sapphire
at
that
moment
he
finished
pushing
back
the
silk
cord
and
from
the
hollow
of
a
cup
he
took
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
a
wonderful
blue
stone
perfect
in
respect
of
size
and
purity
ha
what
did
i
tell
you
friend
of
my
youth
he
raised
his
head
the
inspector
had
turned
livid
and
was
staring
as
though
fascinated
by
the
stone
that
sparkled
before
him
he
at
last
realized
the
whole
plot
you
dirty
scoundrel
he
muttered
repeating
the
insults
which
he
had
used
at
the
first
interview
you
scum
of
the
earth
the
two
men
were
standing
one
against
the
other
give
me
back
that
said
the
inspector
lupin
held
out
the
piece
of
silk
and
the
sapphire
said
ganimard
in
a
peremptory
tone
do
be
silly
give
it
back
or
or
what
you
idiot
cried
lupin
look
here
do
you
think
i
put
you
on
to
this
soft
thing
for
nothing
give
it
back
you
have
noticed
what
i
been
about
that
plain
what
for
four
weeks
i
kept
you
on
the
move
like
a
deer
and
you
want
to
come
ganimard
old
chap
pull
yourself
together
do
you
see
that
been
playing
the
good
dog
for
four
weeks
on
end
fetch
it
rover
there
a
nice
blue
pebble
over
there
which
master
ca
get
at
hunt
it
ganimard
fetch
it
bring
it
to
master
ah
he
his
own
good
little
dog
sit
up
beg
want
a
bit
of
sugar
then
ganimard
containing
the
anger
that
seethed
within
him
thought
only
of
one
thing
summoning
his
detectives
and
as
the
room
in
which
he
now
was
looked
out
on
the
courtyard
he
tried
gradually
to
work
his
way
round
to
the
communicating
door
he
would
then
run
to
the
window
and
break
one
of
the
panes
all
the
same
continued
lupin
what
a
pack
of
dunderheads
you
and
the
rest
must
be
you
had
the
silk
all
this
time
and
not
one
of
you
ever
thought
of
feeling
it
not
one
of
you
ever
asked
himself
the
reason
why
the
poor
girl
hung
on
to
her
scarf
not
one
of
you
you
just
acted
at
haphazard
without
reflecting
without
foreseeing
anything
the
inspector
had
attained
his
object
taking
advantage
of
a
second
when
lupin
had
turned
away
from
him
he
suddenly
wheeled
round
and
grasped
the
but
an
oath
escaped
him
the
handle
did
not
budge
lupin
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughing
not
even
that
you
did
not
even
foresee
that
you
lay
a
trap
for
me
and
you
wo
admit
that
i
may
perhaps
smell
the
thing
out
beforehand
and
you
allow
yourself
to
be
brought
into
this
room
without
asking
whether
i
am
not
bringing
you
here
for
a
particular
reason
and
without
remembering
that
the
locks
are
fitted
with
a
special
mechanism
come
now
speaking
frankly
what
do
you
think
of
it
yourself
what
do
i
think
of
it
roared
ganimard
beside
himself
with
rage
he
had
drawn
his
revolver
and
was
pointing
it
straight
at
lupin
face
hands
up
he
cried
that
what
i
think
of
it
lupin
placed
himself
in
front
of
him
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
sold
again
he
said
hands
up
i
say
once
more
and
sold
again
say
i
your
deadly
weapon
wo
go
off
what
old
catherine
your
housekeeper
is
in
my
service
she
damped
the
charges
this
morning
while
you
were
having
your
breakfast
coffee
ganimard
made
a
furious
gesture
pocketed
the
revolver
and
rushed
at
lupin
well
said
lupin
stopping
him
short
with
a
kick
on
the
shin
their
clothes
were
almost
touching
they
exchanged
defiant
glances
the
glances
of
two
adversaries
who
mean
to
come
to
blows
nevertheless
there
was
no
fight
the
recollection
of
the
earlier
struggles
made
any
present
struggle
useless
and
ganimard
who
remembered
all
his
past
failures
his
vain
attacks
lupin
crushing
reprisals
did
not
lift
a
limb
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
felt
it
lupin
had
forces
at
his
command
against
which
any
individual
force
simply
broke
to
pieces
so
what
was
the
good
i
agree
said
lupin
in
a
friendly
voice
as
though
answering
ganimard
unspoken
thought
you
would
do
better
to
let
things
be
as
they
are
besides
friend
of
my
youth
think
of
all
that
this
incident
has
brought
you
fame
the
certainty
of
quick
promotion
and
thanks
to
that
the
prospect
of
a
happy
and
comfortable
old
age
surely
you
want
the
discovery
of
the
sapphire
and
the
head
of
poor
arsène
lupin
in
addition
it
would
be
fair
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
poor
arsène
lupin
saved
your
life
yes
sir
who
warned
you
at
this
very
spot
that
prévailles
was
and
is
this
the
way
you
thank
me
it
not
pretty
of
you
ganimard
upon
my
word
you
make
me
blush
for
you
while
chattering
lupin
had
gone
through
the
same
performance
as
ganimard
and
was
now
near
the
door
ganimard
saw
that
his
foe
was
about
to
escape
him
forgetting
all
prudence
he
tried
to
block
his
way
and
received
a
tremendous
butt
in
the
stomach
which
sent
him
rolling
to
the
opposite
wall
lupin
dexterously
touched
a
spring
turned
the
handle
opened
the
door
and
slipped
away
roaring
with
laughter
as
he
went
twenty
minutes
later
when
ganimard
at
last
succeeded
in
joining
his
men
one
of
them
said
to
him
a
left
the
house
as
his
mates
were
coming
back
from
breakfast
and
put
a
letter
in
my
hand
that
to
your
governor
he
said
governor
i
asked
but
he
was
gone
i
suppose
it
meant
for
you
let
have
it
ganimard
opened
the
letter
it
was
hurriedly
scribbled
in
pencil
and
contained
these
words
this
is
to
warn
you
friend
of
my
youth
against
excessive
credulity
when
a
fellow
tells
you
that
the
cartridges
in
your
revolver
are
damp
however
great
your
confidence
in
that
fellow
may
be
even
though
his
name
be
arsène
lupin
never
allow
yourself
to
be
taken
in
fire
first
and
if
the
fellow
hops
the
twig
you
will
have
acquired
the
proof
that
the
cartridges
are
not
damp
and
that
old
catherine
is
the
most
honest
and
respectable
of
housekeepers
one
of
these
days
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
making
her
acquaintance
meanwhile
friend
of
my
youth
believe
me
always
affectionately
and
sincerely
yours
arsène
lupin
vi
shadowed
by
death
after
he
had
been
round
the
walls
of
the
property
arsène
lupin
returned
to
the
spot
from
which
he
started
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
him
that
there
was
no
breach
in
the
walls
and
the
only
way
of
entering
the
extensive
grounds
of
the
château
de
maupertuis
was
through
a
little
low
door
firmly
bolted
on
the
inside
or
through
the
principal
gate
which
was
overlooked
by
the
lodge
very
well
he
said
we
must
employ
heroic
methods
pushing
his
way
into
the
copsewood
where
he
had
hidden
his
he
unwound
a
length
of
twine
from
under
the
saddle
and
went
to
a
place
which
he
had
noticed
in
the
course
of
his
exploration
at
this
place
which
was
situated
far
from
the
road
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
a
number
of
large
trees
standing
inside
the
park
overlapped
the
wall
lupin
fastened
a
stone
to
the
end
of
the
string
threw
it
up
and
caught
a
thick
branch
which
he
drew
down
to
him
and
bestraddled
the
branch
in
recovering
its
position
raised
him
from
the
ground
he
climbed
over
the
wall
slipped
down
the
tree
and
sprang
lightly
on
the
grass
it
was
winter
and
through
the
leafless
boughs
across
the
undulating
lawns
he
could
see
the
little
château
de
maupertuis
in
the
distance
fearing
lest
he
should
be
perceived
he
concealed
himself
behind
a
clump
of
from
there
with
the
aid
of
a
he
studied
the
dark
and
melancholy
front
of
the
all
the
windows
were
closed
and
as
it
were
barricaded
with
solid
shutters
the
house
might
easily
have
been
uninhabited
by
jove
muttered
lupin
it
not
the
liveliest
of
residences
i
shall
certainly
not
come
here
to
end
my
days
but
the
clock
struck
three
one
of
the
doors
on
the
opened
and
the
figure
of
a
woman
appeared
a
very
slender
figure
wrapped
in
a
brown
cloak
the
woman
walked
up
and
down
for
a
few
minutes
and
was
at
once
surrounded
by
birds
to
which
she
scattered
crumbs
of
bread
then
she
went
down
the
stone
steps
that
led
to
the
middle
lawn
and
skirted
it
taking
the
path
on
the
right
with
his
lupin
could
distinctly
see
her
coming
in
his
direction
she
was
tall
graceful
in
appearance
and
seemed
to
be
quite
a
young
girl
she
walked
with
a
sprightly
step
looking
at
the
pale
december
sun
and
amusing
herself
by
breaking
the
little
dead
twigs
on
the
shrubs
along
the
road
she
had
gone
nearly
two
thirds
of
the
distance
that
separated
her
from
lupin
when
there
came
a
furious
sound
of
barking
and
a
huge
dog
a
colossal
danish
boarhound
sprang
from
a
neighbouring
kennel
and
stood
erect
at
the
end
of
the
chain
by
which
it
was
fastened
the
girl
moved
a
little
to
one
side
without
paying
further
attention
to
what
was
doubtless
a
daily
incident
the
dog
grew
angrier
than
ever
standing
on
its
legs
and
dragging
at
its
collar
at
the
risk
of
strangling
itself
thirty
or
forty
steps
farther
yielding
probably
to
an
impulse
of
impatience
the
girl
turned
round
and
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
the
great
dane
gave
a
start
of
rage
retreated
to
the
back
of
its
kennel
and
rushed
out
again
this
time
unfettered
the
girl
uttered
a
cry
of
mad
terror
the
dog
was
covering
the
space
between
them
trailing
its
broken
chain
behind
it
she
began
to
run
to
run
with
all
her
might
and
screamed
out
desperately
for
help
but
the
dog
came
up
with
her
in
a
few
bounds
she
fell
at
once
exhausted
giving
herself
up
for
lost
the
animal
was
already
upon
her
almost
touching
her
at
that
exact
moment
a
shot
rang
out
the
dog
turned
a
complete
somersault
recovered
its
feet
tore
the
ground
and
then
lay
down
giving
a
number
of
hoarse
breathless
howls
which
ended
in
a
dull
moan
and
an
indistinct
gurgling
and
that
was
all
dead
said
lupin
who
had
hastened
up
at
once
prepared
if
necessary
to
fire
his
revolver
a
second
time
the
girl
had
risen
and
stood
pale
still
staggering
she
looked
in
great
surprise
at
this
man
whom
she
did
not
know
and
who
had
saved
her
life
and
she
whispered
thank
you
i
have
had
a
great
fright
you
were
in
the
nick
of
time
i
thank
you
monsieur
lupin
took
off
his
hat
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
mademoiselle
my
name
is
paul
daubreuil
but
before
entering
into
any
explanations
i
must
ask
for
one
moment
he
stooped
over
the
dog
dead
body
and
examined
the
chain
at
the
part
where
the
brute
effort
had
snapped
it
that
it
he
said
between
his
teeth
it
just
as
i
suspected
by
jupiter
things
are
moving
rapidly
i
ought
to
have
come
earlier
returning
to
the
girl
side
he
said
to
her
speaking
very
quickly
mademoiselle
we
have
not
a
minute
to
lose
my
presence
in
these
grounds
is
quite
irregular
i
do
not
wish
to
be
surprised
here
and
this
for
reasons
that
concern
yourself
alone
do
you
think
that
the
report
can
have
been
heard
at
the
house
the
girl
seemed
already
to
have
recovered
from
her
emotion
and
she
replied
with
a
calmness
that
revealed
all
her
pluck
i
do
think
so
is
your
father
in
the
house
my
father
is
ill
and
has
been
in
bed
for
months
besides
his
room
looks
out
on
the
other
front
and
the
servants
their
quarters
and
the
kitchen
are
also
on
the
other
side
no
one
ever
comes
to
this
part
i
walk
here
myself
but
nobody
else
does
it
is
probable
therefore
that
i
have
not
been
seen
either
especially
as
the
trees
hide
us
it
is
most
probable
then
i
can
speak
to
you
freely
certainly
but
i
do
understand
you
will
presently
permit
me
to
be
brief
the
point
is
this
four
days
ago
mlle
jeanne
darcieux
that
is
my
name
she
said
smiling
mlle
jeanne
darcieux
continued
lupin
wrote
a
letter
to
one
of
her
friends
called
marceline
who
lives
at
versailles
how
do
you
know
all
that
asked
the
girl
in
astonishment
i
tore
up
the
letter
before
i
had
finished
it
and
you
flung
the
pieces
on
the
edge
of
the
road
that
runs
from
the
house
to
vendôme
that
true
i
had
gone
out
walking
the
pieces
were
picked
up
and
they
came
into
my
hands
next
day
then
you
must
have
read
them
said
jeanne
darcieux
betraying
a
certain
annoyance
by
her
manner
yes
i
committed
that
indiscretion
and
i
do
not
regret
it
because
i
can
save
you
save
me
from
what
from
death
lupin
spoke
this
little
sentence
in
a
very
distinct
voice
the
girl
gave
a
shudder
then
she
said
i
am
not
threatened
with
death
yes
you
are
mademoiselle
at
the
end
of
october
you
were
reading
on
a
bench
on
the
terrace
where
you
were
accustomed
to
sit
at
the
same
hour
every
day
when
a
block
of
stone
fell
from
the
cornice
above
your
head
and
you
were
within
a
few
inches
of
being
crushed
an
accident
one
fine
evening
in
november
you
were
walking
in
the
by
moonlight
a
shot
was
fired
the
bullet
whizzed
past
your
ear
at
least
i
thought
so
lastly
less
than
a
week
ago
the
little
wooden
bridge
that
crosses
the
river
in
the
park
two
yards
from
the
waterfall
gave
way
while
you
were
on
it
you
were
just
able
by
a
miracle
to
catch
hold
of
the
root
of
a
tree
jeanne
darcieux
tried
to
smile
very
well
but
as
i
wrote
to
marceline
these
are
only
a
series
of
coincidences
of
accidents
no
mademoiselle
no
one
accident
of
this
sort
is
allowable
so
are
two
and
even
then
but
we
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
the
chapter
of
accidents
repeating
the
same
act
three
times
in
such
different
and
extraordinary
circumstances
is
a
mere
amusing
coincidence
that
is
why
i
thought
that
i
might
presume
to
come
to
your
assistance
and
as
my
intervention
can
be
of
no
use
unless
it
remains
secret
i
did
not
hesitate
to
make
my
way
in
here
without
walking
through
the
gate
i
came
in
the
nick
of
time
as
you
said
your
enemy
was
attacking
you
once
more
what
do
you
think
no
it
is
impossible
i
refuse
to
believe
lupin
picked
up
the
chain
and
showing
it
to
her
look
at
the
last
link
there
is
no
question
but
that
it
has
been
filed
otherwise
so
powerful
a
chain
as
this
would
never
have
yielded
besides
you
can
see
the
mark
of
the
file
here
jeanne
turned
pale
and
her
pretty
features
were
distorted
with
terror
but
who
can
bear
me
such
a
grudge
she
gasped
it
is
terrible
i
have
never
done
any
one
harm
and
yet
you
are
certainly
right
worse
still
she
finished
her
sentence
in
a
lower
voice
worse
still
i
am
wondering
whether
the
same
danger
does
not
threaten
my
father
has
he
been
attacked
also
no
for
he
never
stirs
from
his
room
but
his
is
such
a
mysterious
illness
he
has
no
strength
he
can
not
walk
at
all
in
addition
to
that
he
is
subject
to
fits
of
suffocation
as
though
his
heart
stopped
beating
oh
what
an
awful
thing
lupin
realized
all
the
authority
which
he
was
able
to
assert
at
such
a
moment
and
he
said
have
no
fear
mademoiselle
if
you
obey
me
blindly
i
shall
be
sure
to
succeed
yes
yes
i
am
quite
willing
but
all
this
is
so
terrible
trust
me
i
beg
of
you
and
please
listen
to
me
i
shall
want
a
few
particulars
he
rapped
out
a
number
of
questions
which
jeanne
darcieux
answered
hurriedly
that
animal
was
never
let
loose
was
he
never
who
used
to
feed
him
the
he
brought
him
his
food
every
evening
consequently
he
could
go
near
him
without
being
bitten
yes
and
he
only
for
the
dog
was
very
savage
you
do
suspect
the
man
oh
no
baptiste
never
and
you
ca
think
of
anybody
no
our
servants
are
quite
devoted
to
us
they
are
very
fond
of
me
you
have
no
friends
staying
in
the
house
no
no
brother
no
then
your
father
is
your
only
protector
yes
and
i
have
told
you
the
condition
he
is
in
have
you
told
him
of
the
different
attempts
yes
and
it
was
wrong
of
me
to
do
so
our
doctor
old
guéroult
forbade
me
to
cause
him
the
least
excitement
your
mother
i
do
remember
her
she
died
sixteen
years
ago
just
sixteen
years
ago
how
old
were
you
then
i
was
not
quite
five
years
old
and
were
you
living
here
we
were
living
in
paris
my
father
only
bought
this
place
the
year
after
lupin
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
he
concluded
very
well
mademoiselle
i
am
obliged
to
you
those
particulars
are
all
i
need
for
the
present
besides
it
would
not
be
wise
for
us
to
remain
together
longer
but
she
said
the
will
find
the
dog
soon
who
will
have
killed
him
you
mademoiselle
to
defend
yourself
against
an
attack
i
never
carry
firearms
i
am
afraid
you
do
said
lupin
smiling
because
you
killed
the
dog
and
there
is
no
one
but
you
who
could
have
killed
him
for
that
matter
let
them
think
what
they
please
the
great
thing
is
that
i
shall
not
be
suspected
when
i
come
to
the
house
to
the
house
do
you
intend
to
yes
i
do
yet
know
how
but
i
shall
come
this
very
evening
so
once
more
be
easy
in
your
mind
i
will
answer
for
everything
jeanne
looked
at
him
and
dominated
by
him
conquered
by
his
air
of
assurance
and
good
faith
she
said
simply
i
am
quite
easy
then
all
will
go
well
till
this
evening
mademoiselle
till
this
evening
she
walked
away
and
lupin
following
her
with
his
eyes
until
the
moment
when
she
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
murmured
what
a
pretty
creature
it
would
be
a
pity
if
any
harm
were
to
come
to
her
luckily
arsène
lupin
is
keeping
his
open
taking
care
not
to
be
seen
with
eyes
and
ears
attentive
to
the
least
sight
or
sound
he
inspected
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
grounds
looked
for
the
little
low
door
which
he
had
noticed
outside
and
which
was
the
door
of
the
kitchen
garden
drew
the
bolt
took
the
key
and
then
skirted
the
walls
and
found
himself
once
more
near
the
tree
which
he
had
climbed
two
minutes
later
he
was
mounting
his
the
village
of
maupertuis
lay
quite
close
to
the
estate
lupin
inquired
and
learnt
that
guéroult
lived
next
door
to
the
church
he
rang
was
shown
into
the
and
introduced
himself
by
his
name
of
paul
daubreuil
of
the
rue
de
surène
paris
adding
that
he
had
official
relations
with
the
a
fact
which
he
requested
might
be
kept
secret
he
had
become
acquainted
by
means
of
a
torn
letter
with
the
incidents
that
had
endangered
mlle
life
and
he
had
come
to
that
young
lady
assistance
guéroult
an
old
country
practitioner
who
idolized
jeanne
on
hearing
lupin
explanations
at
once
admitted
that
those
incidents
constituted
undeniable
proofs
of
a
plot
he
showed
great
concern
offered
his
visitor
hospitality
and
kept
him
to
dinner
the
two
men
talked
at
length
in
the
evening
they
walked
round
to
the
together
the
doctor
went
to
the
sick
man
room
which
was
on
the
first
floor
and
asked
leave
to
bring
up
a
young
colleague
to
whom
he
intended
soon
to
make
over
his
practice
when
he
retired
lupin
on
entering
saw
jeanne
darcieux
seated
by
her
father
bedside
she
suppressed
a
movement
of
surprise
and
at
a
sign
from
the
doctor
left
the
room
the
consultation
thereupon
took
place
in
lupin
presence
face
was
worn
with
much
suffering
and
his
eyes
were
bright
with
fever
he
complained
particularly
that
day
of
his
heart
after
the
auscultation
he
questioned
the
doctor
with
obvious
anxiety
and
each
reply
seemed
to
give
him
relief
he
also
spoke
of
jeanne
and
expressed
his
conviction
that
they
were
deceiving
him
and
that
his
daughter
had
escaped
yet
more
accidents
he
continued
perturbed
in
spite
of
the
doctor
denials
he
wanted
to
have
the
police
informed
and
inquiries
set
on
foot
but
his
excitement
tired
him
and
he
gradually
dropped
off
to
sleep
lupin
stopped
the
doctor
in
the
passage
come
doctor
give
me
your
exact
opinion
do
you
think
that
darcieux
illness
can
be
attributed
to
an
outside
cause
how
do
you
mean
well
suppose
that
the
same
enemy
should
be
interested
in
removing
both
father
and
daughter
the
doctor
seemed
struck
by
the
suggestion
upon
my
word
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
the
illness
at
times
adopts
such
a
very
unusual
character
for
instance
the
paralysis
of
the
legs
which
is
almost
complete
ought
to
be
accompanied
by
the
doctor
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice
you
think
it
poison
of
course
but
what
poison
besides
i
see
no
toxic
symptoms
it
would
have
to
be
but
what
are
you
doing
what
the
matter
the
two
men
were
talking
outside
a
little
on
the
first
floor
where
jeanne
seizing
the
opportunity
while
the
doctor
was
with
her
father
had
begun
her
evening
meal
lupin
who
was
watching
her
through
the
open
door
saw
her
lift
a
cup
to
her
lips
and
take
a
few
sups
suddenly
he
rushed
at
her
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
what
are
you
drinking
there
why
she
said
taken
aback
only
tea
you
pulled
a
face
of
disgust
what
made
you
do
that
i
do
know
i
thought
you
thought
what
that
that
it
tasted
rather
bitter
but
i
expect
that
comes
from
the
medicine
i
mixed
with
it
what
medicine
some
drops
which
i
take
at
dinner
the
drops
which
you
prescribed
for
me
you
know
doctor
yes
said
guéroult
but
that
medicine
has
no
taste
of
any
kind
you
know
it
has
jeanne
for
you
have
been
taking
it
for
a
fortnight
and
this
is
the
first
time
quite
right
said
the
girl
and
this
does
have
a
taste
there
oh
my
mouth
is
still
burning
guéroult
now
took
a
sip
from
the
cup
faugh
he
exclaimed
spitting
it
out
again
there
no
mistake
about
it
lupin
on
his
side
was
examining
the
bottle
containing
the
medicine
and
he
asked
where
is
this
bottle
kept
in
the
daytime
but
jeanne
was
unable
to
answer
she
had
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
with
staring
eyes
seemed
to
be
suffering
great
pain
it
hurts
it
hurts
she
stammered
the
two
men
quickly
carried
her
to
her
room
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
she
ought
to
have
an
emetic
said
lupin
open
the
cupboard
said
the
doctor
you
see
a
have
you
got
it
take
out
one
of
those
little
tubes
yes
that
one
and
now
some
hot
water
you
find
some
on
the
in
the
other
room
jeanne
own
maid
came
running
up
in
answer
to
the
bell
lupin
told
her
that
mlle
darcieux
had
been
taken
unwell
for
some
unknown
reason
he
next
returned
to
the
little
inspected
the
sideboard
and
the
cupboards
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
pretended
that
the
doctor
had
sent
him
to
ask
about
darcieux
diet
without
appearing
to
do
so
he
catechized
the
cook
the
butler
and
baptiste
the
who
had
his
meals
at
the
with
the
servants
then
he
went
back
to
the
doctor
well
she
asleep
any
danger
no
fortunately
she
had
only
taken
two
or
three
sips
but
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
saved
her
life
as
the
analysis
of
this
bottle
will
show
quite
superfluous
to
make
an
analysis
doctor
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
attempt
at
poisoning
by
whom
i
ca
say
but
the
demon
who
is
engineering
all
this
business
clearly
knows
the
ways
of
the
house
he
comes
and
goes
as
he
pleases
walks
about
in
the
park
files
the
dog
chain
mixes
poison
with
the
food
and
in
short
moves
and
acts
precisely
as
though
he
were
living
the
very
life
of
her
or
rather
of
those
whom
he
wants
to
put
away
ah
you
really
believe
that
darcieux
is
threatened
with
the
same
danger
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
it
then
it
must
be
one
of
the
servants
but
that
is
most
unlikely
do
you
think
i
think
nothing
doctor
i
know
nothing
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
situation
is
most
tragic
and
that
we
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
death
is
here
doctor
shadowing
the
people
in
this
house
and
it
will
soon
strike
at
those
whom
it
is
pursuing
what
to
be
done
watch
doctor
let
us
pretend
that
we
are
alarmed
about
health
and
spend
the
night
in
here
the
bedrooms
of
both
the
father
and
daughter
are
close
by
if
anything
happens
we
are
sure
to
hear
there
was
an
in
the
room
they
arranged
to
sleep
in
it
turn
and
turn
about
in
reality
lupin
slept
for
only
two
or
three
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
left
the
room
without
disturbing
his
companion
carefully
looked
round
the
whole
of
the
house
and
walked
out
through
the
principal
gate
he
reached
paris
on
his
at
nine
in
the
morning
two
of
his
friends
to
whom
he
telephoned
on
the
road
met
him
there
they
all
three
spent
the
day
in
making
searches
which
lupin
had
planned
out
beforehand
he
set
out
again
hurriedly
at
six
and
never
perhaps
as
he
told
me
subsequently
did
he
risk
his
life
with
greater
temerity
than
in
his
breakneck
ride
at
a
mad
rate
of
speed
on
a
foggy
december
evening
with
the
light
of
his
lamp
hardly
able
to
pierce
through
the
darkness
he
sprang
from
his
bicycle
outside
the
gate
which
was
still
open
ran
to
the
house
and
reached
the
first
floor
in
a
few
bounds
there
was
no
one
in
the
little
without
hesitating
without
knocking
he
walked
into
jeanne
bedroom
ah
here
you
are
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
seeing
jeanne
and
the
doctor
sitting
side
by
side
talking
what
any
news
asked
the
doctor
alarmed
at
seeing
such
a
state
of
agitation
in
a
man
whose
coolness
he
had
had
occasion
to
observe
no
said
lupin
no
news
and
here
none
here
either
we
have
just
left
darcieux
he
has
had
an
excellent
day
and
he
ate
his
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
as
for
jeanne
you
can
see
for
yourself
she
has
all
her
pretty
colour
back
again
then
she
must
go
go
but
it
out
of
the
question
protested
the
girl
you
must
go
you
must
cried
lupin
with
real
violence
stamping
his
foot
on
the
floor
he
at
once
mastered
himself
spoke
a
few
words
of
apology
and
then
for
three
or
four
minutes
preserved
a
complete
silence
which
the
doctor
and
jeanne
were
careful
not
to
disturb
at
last
he
said
to
the
young
girl
you
shall
go
morning
mademoiselle
it
will
be
only
for
one
or
two
weeks
i
will
take
you
to
your
friend
at
versailles
the
one
to
whom
you
were
writing
i
entreat
you
to
get
everything
ready
without
concealment
of
any
kind
let
the
servants
know
that
you
are
going
on
the
other
hand
the
doctor
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
darcieux
and
give
him
to
understand
with
every
possible
precaution
that
this
journey
is
essential
to
your
safety
besides
he
can
join
you
as
soon
as
his
strength
permits
that
settled
is
it
not
yes
she
said
absolutely
dominated
by
lupin
gentle
and
imperious
voice
in
that
case
he
said
be
as
quick
as
you
can
and
do
not
stir
from
your
room
but
said
the
girl
with
a
shudder
am
i
to
stay
alone
fear
nothing
should
there
be
the
least
danger
the
doctor
and
i
will
come
back
do
not
open
your
door
unless
you
hear
three
very
light
taps
jeanne
at
once
rang
for
her
maid
the
doctor
went
to
darcieux
while
lupin
had
some
supper
brought
to
him
in
the
little
that
done
said
the
doctor
returning
to
him
in
twenty
time
darcieux
did
not
raise
any
great
difficulty
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
himself
thinks
it
just
as
well
that
we
should
send
jeanne
away
they
then
went
downstairs
together
and
left
the
house
on
reaching
the
lodge
lupin
called
the
keeper
you
can
shut
the
gate
my
man
if
darcieux
should
want
us
send
for
us
at
once
the
clock
of
maupertuis
church
struck
ten
the
sky
was
overcast
with
black
clouds
through
which
the
moon
broke
at
moments
the
two
men
walked
on
for
sixty
or
seventy
yards
they
were
nearing
the
village
when
lupin
gripped
his
companion
by
the
arm
stop
what
on
earth
the
matter
exclaimed
the
doctor
the
matter
is
this
lupin
jerked
out
that
if
my
calculations
turn
out
right
if
i
have
not
misjudged
the
business
from
start
to
finish
mlle
darcieux
will
be
murdered
before
the
night
is
out
eh
what
that
gasped
the
doctor
in
dismay
but
then
why
did
we
go
with
the
precise
object
that
the
miscreant
who
is
watching
all
our
movements
in
the
dark
may
not
postpone
his
crime
and
may
perpetrate
it
not
at
the
hour
chosen
by
himself
but
at
the
hour
which
i
have
decided
upon
then
we
are
returning
to
the
yes
of
course
we
are
but
separately
in
that
case
let
us
go
at
once
listen
to
me
doctor
said
lupin
in
a
steady
voice
and
let
us
waste
no
time
in
useless
words
above
all
we
must
defeat
any
attempt
to
watch
us
you
will
therefore
go
straight
home
and
not
come
out
again
until
you
are
quite
certain
that
you
have
not
been
followed
you
will
then
make
for
the
walls
of
the
property
keeping
to
the
left
till
you
come
to
the
little
door
of
the
here
is
the
key
when
the
church
clock
strikes
eleven
open
the
door
very
gently
and
walk
right
up
to
the
terrace
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
fifth
window
is
badly
fastened
you
have
only
to
climb
over
the
balcony
as
soon
as
you
are
inside
mlle
darcieux
room
bolt
the
door
and
do
budge
you
quite
understand
do
budge
either
of
you
whatever
happens
i
have
noticed
that
mlle
darcieux
leaves
her
window
ajar
is
that
so
yes
it
a
habit
which
i
taught
her
that
the
way
they
come
and
you
that
the
way
i
shall
come
also
and
do
you
know
who
the
villain
is
lupin
hesitated
and
then
replied
no
i
do
know
and
that
is
just
how
we
shall
find
out
but
i
implore
you
keep
cool
not
a
word
not
a
movement
i
promise
you
i
want
more
than
that
doctor
you
must
give
me
your
word
of
honour
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
the
doctor
went
away
lupin
at
once
climbed
a
neighbouring
mound
from
which
he
could
see
the
windows
of
the
first
and
second
floor
several
of
them
were
lighted
he
waited
for
some
little
time
the
lights
went
out
one
by
one
then
taking
a
direction
opposite
to
that
in
which
the
doctor
had
gone
he
branched
off
to
the
right
and
skirted
the
wall
until
he
came
to
the
clump
of
trees
near
which
he
had
hidden
his
on
the
day
before
eleven
struck
he
calculated
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
doctor
to
cross
the
and
make
his
way
into
the
house
that
one
point
scored
he
muttered
everything
all
right
on
that
side
and
now
lupin
to
the
rescue
the
enemy
wo
be
long
before
he
plays
his
last
trump
and
by
all
the
gods
i
must
be
there
he
went
through
the
same
performance
as
on
the
first
occasion
pulled
down
the
branch
and
hoisted
himself
to
the
top
of
the
wall
from
which
he
was
able
to
reach
the
bigger
boughs
of
the
tree
just
then
he
pricked
up
his
ears
he
seemed
to
hear
a
rustling
of
dead
leaves
and
he
actually
perceived
a
dark
form
moving
on
the
level
thirty
yards
away
hang
it
all
he
said
to
himself
i
done
the
scoundrel
has
smelt
a
rat
a
moonbeam
pierced
through
the
clouds
lupin
distinctly
saw
the
man
take
aim
he
tried
to
jump
to
the
ground
and
turned
his
head
but
he
felt
something
hit
him
in
the
chest
heard
the
sound
of
a
report
uttered
an
angry
oath
and
came
crashing
down
from
branch
to
branch
like
a
corpse
meanwhile
doctor
guéroult
following
arsène
lupin
instructions
had
climbed
the
ledge
of
the
fifth
window
and
groped
his
way
to
the
first
floor
on
reaching
jeanne
room
he
tapped
lightly
three
times
at
the
door
and
immediately
on
entering
pushed
the
bolt
lie
down
at
once
he
whispered
to
the
girl
who
had
not
taken
off
her
things
you
must
appear
to
have
gone
to
bed
brrrr
it
cold
in
here
is
the
window
open
in
your
yes
would
you
like
me
to
no
leave
it
as
it
is
they
are
coming
they
are
coming
spluttered
jeanne
in
affright
yes
beyond
a
doubt
but
who
do
you
suspect
any
one
i
do
know
who
i
expect
that
there
is
some
one
hidden
in
the
house
or
in
the
park
oh
i
feel
so
frightened
do
be
frightened
the
sportsman
who
looking
after
you
seems
jolly
clever
and
makes
a
point
of
playing
a
safe
game
i
expect
he
on
the
in
the
court
the
doctor
put
out
the
went
to
the
window
and
raised
the
blind
a
narrow
cornice
running
along
the
first
story
prevented
him
from
seeing
more
than
a
distant
part
of
the
courtyard
and
he
came
back
and
sat
down
by
the
bed
some
very
painful
minutes
passed
minutes
that
appeared
to
them
interminably
long
the
clock
in
the
village
struck
but
taken
up
as
they
were
with
all
the
little
noises
of
the
night
they
hardly
noticed
the
sound
they
listened
listened
with
all
their
nerves
on
edge
did
you
hear
whispered
the
doctor
yes
yes
said
jeanne
sitting
up
in
bed
lie
down
lie
down
he
said
presently
there
some
one
coming
there
was
a
little
tapping
sound
outside
against
the
cornice
next
came
a
series
of
indistinct
noises
the
nature
of
which
they
could
not
make
out
for
certain
but
they
had
a
feeling
that
the
window
in
the
was
being
opened
wider
for
they
were
buffeted
by
gusts
of
cold
air
suddenly
it
became
quite
clear
there
was
some
one
next
door
the
doctor
whose
hand
was
trembling
a
little
seized
his
revolver
nevertheless
he
did
not
move
remembering
the
formal
orders
which
he
had
received
and
fearing
to
act
against
them
the
room
was
in
absolute
darkness
and
they
were
unable
to
see
where
the
adversary
was
but
they
felt
his
presence
they
followed
his
invisible
movements
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
deadened
by
the
carpet
and
they
did
not
doubt
but
that
he
had
already
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
room
and
the
adversary
stopped
of
that
they
were
certain
he
was
standing
six
steps
away
from
the
bed
motionless
undecided
perhaps
seeking
to
pierce
the
darkness
with
his
keen
eyes
jeanne
hand
and
clammy
trembled
in
the
doctor
grasp
with
his
other
hand
the
doctor
clutched
his
revolver
with
his
finger
on
the
trigger
in
spite
of
his
pledged
word
he
did
not
hesitate
if
the
adversary
touched
the
end
of
the
bed
the
shot
would
be
fired
at
a
venture
the
adversary
took
another
step
and
then
stopped
again
and
there
was
something
awful
about
that
silence
that
impassive
silence
that
darkness
in
which
those
human
beings
were
peering
at
one
another
wildly
who
was
it
looming
in
the
murky
darkness
who
was
the
man
what
horrible
enmity
was
it
that
turned
his
hand
against
the
girl
and
what
abominable
aim
was
he
pursuing
terrified
though
they
were
jeanne
and
the
doctor
thought
only
of
that
one
thing
to
see
to
learn
the
truth
to
gaze
upon
the
face
he
took
one
more
step
and
did
not
move
again
it
seemed
to
them
that
his
figure
stood
out
darker
against
the
dark
space
and
that
his
arm
rose
slowly
slowly
a
minute
passed
and
then
another
minute
and
suddenly
beyond
the
man
on
the
right
a
sharp
click
a
bright
light
flashed
was
flung
upon
the
man
lit
him
full
in
the
face
remorselessly
jeanne
gave
a
cry
of
affright
she
had
seen
standing
over
her
with
a
dagger
in
his
hand
she
had
seen
her
father
almost
at
the
same
time
though
the
light
was
already
turned
off
there
came
a
report
the
doctor
had
fired
dash
it
all
do
shoot
roared
lupin
he
threw
his
arms
round
the
doctor
who
choked
out
did
you
see
did
you
see
listen
he
escaping
let
him
escape
it
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
he
pressed
the
spring
of
his
electric
lantern
again
ran
to
the
made
certain
that
the
man
had
disappeared
and
returning
quietly
to
the
table
lit
the
lamp
jeanne
lay
on
her
bed
pallid
in
a
dead
faint
the
doctor
huddled
in
his
chair
emitted
inarticulate
sounds
come
said
lupin
laughing
pull
yourself
together
there
is
nothing
to
excite
ourselves
about
it
all
over
her
father
her
father
moaned
the
old
doctor
if
you
please
doctor
mlle
darcieux
is
look
after
her
without
more
words
lupin
went
back
to
the
and
stepped
out
on
the
a
ladder
stood
against
the
ledge
he
ran
down
it
skirting
the
wall
of
the
house
twenty
steps
farther
he
tripped
over
the
rungs
of
a
which
he
climbed
and
found
himself
in
darcieux
bedroom
the
room
was
empty
just
so
he
said
my
gentleman
did
not
like
the
position
and
has
cleared
out
here
wishing
him
a
good
journey
and
of
course
the
door
is
bolted
exactly
that
is
how
our
sick
man
tricking
his
worthy
medical
attendant
used
to
get
up
at
night
in
full
security
fasten
his
to
the
balcony
and
prepare
his
little
games
no
fool
is
friend
darcieux
he
drew
the
bolts
and
returned
to
jeanne
room
the
doctor
who
was
just
coming
out
of
the
doorway
drew
him
to
the
little
she
asleep
do
let
us
disturb
her
she
has
had
a
bad
shock
and
will
take
some
time
to
recover
lupin
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
water
and
drank
it
down
then
he
took
a
chair
and
calmly
pooh
she
be
all
right
by
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
she
be
all
right
by
why
in
the
first
place
because
it
did
not
strike
me
that
mlle
darcieux
felt
any
very
great
affection
for
her
father
never
mind
think
of
it
a
father
who
tries
to
kill
his
daughter
a
father
who
for
months
on
end
repeats
his
monstrous
attempt
four
five
six
times
over
again
well
is
that
enough
to
blight
a
less
sensitive
soul
than
jeanne
for
good
and
all
what
a
hateful
memory
she
will
forget
one
does
not
forget
such
a
thing
as
that
she
will
forget
doctor
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
explain
yourself
she
is
not
darcieux
daughter
eh
i
repeat
she
is
not
that
villain
daughter
what
do
you
mean
darcieux
darcieux
is
only
her
she
had
just
been
born
when
her
father
her
real
father
died
jeanne
mother
then
married
a
cousin
of
her
husband
a
man
bearing
the
same
name
and
she
died
within
a
year
of
her
second
wedding
she
left
jeanne
in
darcieux
charge
he
first
took
her
abroad
and
then
bought
this
and
as
nobody
knew
him
in
the
neighbourhood
he
represented
the
child
as
being
his
daughter
she
herself
did
not
know
the
truth
about
her
birth
the
doctor
sat
confounded
he
asked
are
you
sure
of
your
facts
i
spent
my
day
in
the
of
the
paris
municipalities
i
searched
the
registers
i
interviewed
two
solicitors
i
have
seen
all
the
documents
there
is
no
doubt
possible
but
that
does
not
explain
the
crime
or
rather
the
series
of
crimes
yes
it
does
declared
lupin
and
from
the
start
from
the
first
hour
when
i
meddled
in
this
business
some
words
which
mlle
darcieux
used
made
me
suspect
that
direction
which
my
investigations
must
take
was
not
quite
five
years
old
when
my
mother
died
she
said
was
sixteen
years
ago
mlle
darcieux
therefore
was
nearly
that
is
to
say
she
was
on
the
verge
of
attaining
her
majority
i
at
once
saw
that
this
was
an
important
detail
the
day
on
which
you
reach
your
majority
is
the
day
on
which
your
accounts
are
rendered
what
was
the
financial
position
of
mlle
darcieux
who
was
her
mother
natural
heiress
of
course
i
did
not
think
of
the
father
for
a
second
to
begin
with
one
ca
imagine
a
thing
like
that
and
then
the
farce
which
darcieux
was
playing
helpless
bedridden
ill
really
ill
interrupted
the
doctor
all
this
diverted
suspicion
from
him
the
more
so
as
i
believe
that
he
himself
was
exposed
to
criminal
attacks
but
was
there
not
in
the
family
some
person
who
would
be
interested
in
their
removal
my
journey
to
paris
revealed
the
truth
to
me
mlle
darcieux
inherits
a
large
fortune
from
her
mother
of
which
her
draws
the
income
the
solicitor
was
to
have
called
a
meeting
of
the
family
in
paris
next
month
the
truth
would
have
been
out
it
meant
ruin
to
m
darcieux
then
he
had
put
no
money
by
yes
but
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
as
the
result
of
unfortunate
speculations
but
after
all
jeanne
would
not
have
taken
the
management
of
her
fortune
out
of
his
hands
there
is
one
detail
which
you
do
not
know
doctor
and
which
i
learnt
from
reading
the
torn
letter
mlle
darcieux
is
in
love
with
the
brother
of
marceline
her
versailles
friend
darcieux
was
opposed
to
the
marriage
and
you
now
see
the
reason
she
was
waiting
until
she
came
of
age
to
be
married
you
right
said
the
doctor
you
right
it
meant
his
ruin
his
absolute
ruin
one
chance
of
saving
himself
remained
the
death
of
his
of
whom
he
is
the
next
heir
certainly
but
on
condition
that
no
one
suspected
him
of
course
and
that
is
why
he
contrived
the
series
of
accidents
so
that
the
death
might
appear
to
be
due
to
misadventure
and
that
is
why
i
on
my
side
wishing
to
bring
things
to
a
head
asked
you
to
tell
him
of
mlle
darcieux
impending
departure
from
that
moment
it
was
no
longer
enough
for
the
sick
man
to
wander
about
the
grounds
and
the
passages
in
the
dark
and
execute
some
leisurely
plan
no
he
had
to
act
to
act
at
once
without
preparation
violently
dagger
in
hand
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
decide
to
do
it
and
he
did
then
he
had
no
suspicions
of
me
yes
he
felt
that
i
would
return
and
he
kept
a
watch
at
the
place
where
i
had
already
climbed
the
wall
well
well
said
lupin
laughing
i
received
a
bullet
full
in
the
chest
or
rather
my
received
a
bullet
here
you
can
see
the
hole
so
i
tumbled
from
the
tree
like
a
dead
man
thinking
that
he
was
rid
of
his
only
adversary
he
went
back
to
the
house
i
saw
him
prowl
about
for
two
hours
then
making
up
his
mind
he
went
to
the
took
a
ladder
and
set
it
against
the
window
i
had
only
to
follow
him
the
doctor
reflected
and
said
you
could
have
collared
him
earlier
why
did
you
let
him
come
up
it
was
a
sore
trial
for
jeanne
and
unnecessary
on
the
contrary
it
was
indispensable
mlle
darcieux
would
never
have
accepted
the
truth
it
was
essential
that
she
should
see
the
very
face
you
must
tell
her
all
the
circumstances
when
she
wakes
she
will
soon
be
well
again
but
m
darcieux
you
can
explain
his
disappearance
as
you
think
best
a
sudden
journey
a
fit
of
madness
there
will
be
a
few
inquiries
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
will
never
be
heard
of
again
the
doctor
nodded
his
head
yes
that
is
so
that
is
so
you
are
right
you
have
managed
all
this
business
with
extraordinary
skill
and
jeanne
owes
you
her
life
she
will
thank
you
in
person
but
now
can
i
be
of
use
to
you
in
any
way
you
told
me
that
you
were
connected
with
the
will
you
allow
me
to
write
and
praise
your
conduct
your
courage
lupin
began
to
laugh
certainly
a
letter
of
that
kind
will
do
me
a
world
of
good
you
might
write
to
my
immediate
superior
ganimard
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
his
favourite
officer
paul
daubreuil
of
the
rue
de
surène
has
once
again
distinguished
himself
by
a
brilliant
action
as
it
happens
i
have
an
appointment
to
meet
him
about
a
case
of
which
you
may
have
heard
the
case
of
the
red
scarf
how
pleased
my
dear
ganimard
will
be
vii
a
tragedy
in
the
forest
of
morgues
the
village
was
it
was
on
a
sunday
morning
the
peasants
of
and
the
neighbourhood
were
coming
out
of
church
and
spreading
across
the
square
when
suddenly
the
women
who
were
walking
ahead
and
who
had
already
turned
into
the
fell
back
with
loud
cries
of
dismay
at
the
same
moment
an
enormous
looking
like
some
appalling
monster
came
tearing
into
sight
at
a
headlong
rate
of
speed
amid
the
shouts
of
the
madly
scattering
people
it
made
straight
for
the
church
swerved
just
as
it
seemed
about
to
dash
itself
to
pieces
against
the
steps
grazed
the
wall
of
the
presbytery
regained
the
continuation
of
the
national
road
dashed
along
turned
the
corner
and
disappeared
without
by
some
incomprehensible
miracle
having
so
much
as
brushed
against
any
of
the
persons
crowding
the
square
but
they
had
seen
they
had
seen
a
man
in
the
driver
seat
wrapped
in
a
coat
with
a
fur
cap
on
his
head
and
his
face
disguised
in
a
pair
of
large
goggles
and
with
him
on
the
front
of
that
seat
flung
back
bent
in
two
a
woman
whose
head
all
covered
with
blood
hung
down
over
the
bonnet
and
they
had
heard
they
had
heard
the
woman
screams
screams
of
horror
screams
of
agony
and
it
was
all
such
a
vision
of
hell
and
carnage
that
the
people
stood
for
some
seconds
motionless
stupefied
blood
roared
somebody
there
was
blood
everywhere
on
the
cobblestones
of
the
square
on
the
ground
hardened
by
the
first
frosts
of
autumn
and
when
a
number
of
men
and
boys
rushed
off
in
pursuit
of
the
motor
they
had
but
to
take
those
sinister
marks
for
their
guide
the
marks
on
their
part
followed
the
but
in
a
very
strange
manner
going
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
leaving
a
zigzag
track
in
the
wake
of
the
tires
that
made
those
who
saw
it
shudder
how
was
it
that
the
car
had
not
bumped
against
that
tree
how
had
it
been
righted
instead
of
smashing
into
that
bank
what
novice
what
madman
what
drunkard
what
frightened
criminal
was
driving
that
with
such
astounding
bounds
and
swerves
one
of
the
peasants
declared
they
will
never
do
the
turn
in
the
forest
and
another
said
of
course
they
wo
she
bound
to
upset
the
forest
of
morgues
began
at
half
a
mile
beyond
and
the
road
which
was
straight
up
to
that
point
except
for
a
slight
bend
where
it
left
the
village
started
climbing
immediately
after
entering
the
forest
and
made
an
abrupt
turn
among
the
rocks
and
trees
no
was
able
to
take
this
turn
without
first
slackening
speed
there
were
posts
to
give
notice
of
the
danger
the
breathless
peasants
reached
the
quincunx
of
beeches
that
formed
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
one
of
them
at
once
cried
there
you
are
what
upset
the
car
a
limousine
had
turned
turtle
and
lay
smashed
twisted
and
shapeless
beside
it
the
woman
dead
body
but
the
most
horrible
sordid
stupefying
thing
was
the
woman
head
crushed
flattened
invisible
under
a
block
of
stone
a
huge
block
of
stone
lodged
there
by
some
unknown
and
prodigious
agency
as
for
the
man
in
the
coat
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
was
not
found
on
the
scene
of
the
accident
he
was
not
found
either
in
the
neighbourhood
moreover
some
workmen
coming
down
the
côte
de
morgues
declared
that
they
had
not
seen
anybody
the
man
therefore
had
taken
refuge
in
the
woods
the
gendarmes
who
were
at
once
sent
for
made
a
minute
search
assisted
by
the
peasants
but
discovered
nothing
in
the
same
way
the
after
a
close
inquiry
lasting
for
several
days
found
no
clue
capable
of
throwing
the
least
light
upon
this
inscrutable
tragedy
on
the
contrary
the
investigations
only
led
to
further
mysteries
and
further
improbabilities
thus
it
was
ascertained
that
the
block
of
stone
came
from
where
there
had
been
a
landslip
at
least
forty
yards
away
and
the
murderer
in
a
few
minutes
had
carried
it
all
that
distance
and
flung
it
on
his
victim
head
on
the
other
hand
the
murderer
who
was
most
certainly
not
hiding
in
the
forest
for
if
so
he
must
inevitably
have
been
discovered
the
forest
being
of
limited
extent
had
the
audacity
eight
days
after
the
crime
to
come
back
to
the
turn
on
the
hill
and
leave
his
coat
there
why
with
what
object
there
was
nothing
in
the
pockets
of
the
coat
except
a
corkscrew
and
a
napkin
what
did
it
all
mean
inquiries
were
made
of
the
builder
of
the
who
recognized
the
limousine
as
one
which
he
had
sold
three
years
ago
to
a
russian
the
said
russian
declared
the
manufacturer
had
sold
it
again
at
once
to
whom
no
one
knew
the
car
bore
no
number
then
again
it
was
impossible
to
identify
the
dead
woman
body
her
clothes
and
underclothing
were
not
marked
in
any
way
and
the
face
was
quite
unknown
meanwhile
detectives
were
going
along
the
national
road
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
taken
by
the
actors
in
this
mysterious
tragedy
but
who
was
to
prove
that
the
car
had
followed
that
particular
road
on
the
previous
night
they
examined
every
yard
of
the
ground
they
questioned
everybody
at
last
they
succeeded
in
learning
that
on
the
saturday
evening
a
limousine
had
stopped
outside
a
grocer
shop
in
a
small
town
situated
about
two
hundred
miles
from
on
a
highway
branching
out
of
the
national
road
the
driver
had
first
filled
his
tank
bought
some
spare
cans
of
petrol
and
lastly
taken
away
a
small
stock
of
provisions
a
ham
fruit
biscuits
wine
and
a
of
three
star
brandy
there
was
a
lady
on
the
driver
seat
she
did
not
get
down
the
blinds
of
the
limousine
were
drawn
one
of
these
blinds
was
seen
to
move
several
times
the
shopman
was
positive
that
there
was
somebody
inside
presuming
the
shopman
evidence
to
be
correct
then
the
problem
became
even
more
complicated
for
so
far
no
clue
had
revealed
the
presence
of
a
third
person
meanwhile
as
the
travellers
had
supplied
themselves
with
provisions
it
remained
to
be
discovered
what
they
had
done
with
them
and
what
had
become
of
the
remains
the
detectives
retraced
their
steps
it
was
not
until
they
came
to
the
fork
of
the
two
roads
at
a
spot
eleven
or
twelve
miles
from
that
they
met
a
shepherd
who
in
answer
to
their
questions
directed
them
to
a
neighbouring
field
hidden
from
view
behind
the
screen
of
bushes
where
he
had
seen
an
empty
bottle
and
other
things
the
detectives
were
convinced
at
the
first
examination
the
had
stopped
there
and
the
unknown
travellers
probably
after
a
rest
in
their
car
had
breakfasted
and
resumed
their
journey
in
the
course
of
the
morning
one
unmistakable
proof
was
the
of
three
star
brandy
sold
by
the
grocer
this
bottle
had
its
neck
broken
clean
off
with
a
stone
the
stone
employed
for
the
purpose
was
picked
up
as
was
the
neck
of
the
bottle
with
its
cork
covered
with
a
seal
the
seal
showed
marks
of
attempts
that
had
been
made
to
uncork
the
bottle
in
the
ordinary
manner
the
detectives
continued
their
search
and
followed
a
ditch
that
ran
along
the
field
at
right
angles
to
the
road
it
ended
in
a
little
spring
hidden
under
brambles
which
seemed
to
emit
an
offensive
smell
on
lifting
the
brambles
they
perceived
a
corpse
the
corpse
of
a
man
whose
head
had
been
smashed
in
so
that
it
formed
little
more
than
a
sort
of
pulp
swarming
with
vermin
the
body
was
dressed
in
jacket
and
trousers
of
leather
the
pockets
were
empty
no
papers
no
no
watch
the
grocer
and
his
shopman
were
summoned
and
two
days
later
formally
identified
by
his
dress
and
figure
the
traveller
who
had
bought
the
petrol
and
provisions
on
the
saturday
evening
the
whole
case
therefore
had
to
be
reopened
on
a
fresh
basis
the
authorities
were
confronted
with
a
tragedy
no
longer
enacted
by
two
persons
a
man
and
a
woman
of
whom
one
had
killed
the
other
but
by
three
persons
including
two
victims
of
whom
one
was
the
very
man
who
was
accused
of
killing
his
companion
as
to
the
murderer
there
was
no
doubt
he
was
the
person
who
travelled
inside
the
and
who
took
the
precaution
to
remain
concealed
behind
the
curtains
he
had
first
got
rid
of
the
driver
and
rifled
his
pockets
and
then
after
wounding
the
woman
carried
her
off
in
a
mad
dash
for
death
given
a
fresh
case
unexpected
discoveries
unforeseen
evidence
one
might
have
hoped
that
the
mystery
would
be
cleared
up
or
at
least
that
the
inquiry
would
point
a
few
steps
along
the
road
to
the
truth
but
not
at
all
the
corpse
was
simply
placed
beside
the
first
corpse
new
problems
were
added
to
the
old
the
accusation
of
murder
was
shifted
from
the
one
to
the
other
and
there
it
ended
outside
those
tangible
obvious
facts
there
was
nothing
but
darkness
the
name
of
the
woman
the
name
of
the
man
the
name
of
the
murderer
were
so
many
riddles
and
then
what
had
become
of
the
murderer
if
he
had
disappeared
from
one
moment
to
the
other
that
in
itself
would
have
been
a
tolerably
curious
phenomenon
but
the
phenomenon
was
actually
something
very
like
a
miracle
inasmuch
as
the
murderer
had
not
absolutely
disappeared
he
was
there
he
made
a
practice
of
returning
to
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
in
addition
to
the
coat
a
fur
cap
was
picked
up
one
day
and
by
way
of
an
unparalleled
prodigy
one
morning
after
a
whole
night
spent
on
guard
in
the
rock
beside
the
famous
turning
the
detectives
found
on
the
grass
of
the
turning
itself
a
pair
of
broken
rusty
dirty
done
for
how
had
the
murderer
managed
to
bring
back
those
goggles
unseen
by
the
detectives
and
above
all
why
had
he
brought
them
back
men
brains
reeled
in
the
presence
of
such
abnormalities
they
were
almost
afraid
to
pursue
the
ambiguous
adventure
they
received
the
impression
of
a
heavy
stifling
breathless
atmosphere
which
dimmed
the
eyes
and
baffled
the
most
the
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
case
fell
four
days
later
his
successor
confessed
that
the
matter
was
beyond
him
two
tramps
were
arrested
and
at
once
released
another
was
pursued
but
not
caught
moreover
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
sort
or
kind
against
him
in
short
it
was
nothing
but
one
helpless
muddle
of
mist
and
contradiction
an
accident
the
merest
accident
led
to
the
solution
or
rather
produced
a
series
of
circumstances
that
ended
by
leading
to
the
solution
a
reporter
on
the
staff
of
an
important
paris
paper
who
had
been
sent
to
make
investigations
on
the
spot
concluded
his
article
with
the
following
words
i
repeat
therefore
that
we
must
wait
for
fresh
events
fresh
facts
we
must
wait
for
some
lucky
accident
as
things
stand
we
are
simply
wasting
our
time
the
elements
of
truth
are
not
even
sufficient
to
suggest
a
plausible
theory
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
most
absolute
painful
impenetrable
darkness
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
all
the
sherlock
holmeses
in
the
world
would
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
mystery
and
arsène
lupin
himself
if
he
will
allow
me
to
say
so
would
have
to
pay
forfeit
here
on
the
day
after
the
appearance
of
that
article
the
newspaper
in
question
printed
this
telegram
have
sometimes
paid
forfeit
but
never
over
such
a
silly
thing
as
this
the
tragedy
is
a
mystery
for
babies
arsène
lupin
and
the
editor
added
we
insert
this
telegram
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
for
it
is
obviously
the
work
of
a
wag
arsène
lupin
though
he
be
in
the
art
of
practical
joking
would
be
the
last
man
to
display
such
childish
flippancy
two
days
elapsed
and
then
the
paper
published
the
famous
letter
so
precise
and
categorical
in
its
conclusions
in
which
arsène
lupin
furnished
the
solution
of
the
problem
i
quote
it
in
full
sir
you
have
taken
me
on
my
weak
side
by
defying
me
you
challenge
me
and
i
accept
the
challenge
and
i
will
begin
by
declaring
once
more
that
the
tragedy
is
a
mystery
for
babies
i
know
nothing
so
simple
so
natural
and
the
proof
of
the
simplicity
shall
lie
in
the
succinctness
of
my
demonstration
it
is
contained
in
these
few
words
when
a
crime
seems
to
go
beyond
the
ordinary
scope
of
things
when
it
seems
unusual
and
stupid
then
there
are
many
chances
that
its
explanation
is
to
be
found
in
superordinary
supernatural
superhuman
motives
i
say
that
there
are
many
chances
for
we
must
always
allow
for
the
part
played
by
absurdity
in
the
most
logical
and
commonplace
events
but
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
see
things
as
they
are
and
not
to
take
account
of
the
absurd
and
the
disproportionate
i
was
struck
from
the
very
beginning
by
that
very
evident
character
of
unusualness
we
have
first
of
all
the
awkward
zigzag
course
of
the
which
would
give
one
the
impression
that
the
car
was
driven
by
a
novice
people
have
spoken
of
a
drunkard
or
a
madman
a
justifiable
supposition
in
itself
but
neither
madness
nor
drunkenness
would
account
for
the
incredible
strength
required
to
transport
especially
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
the
stone
with
which
the
unfortunate
woman
head
was
crushed
that
proceeding
called
for
a
muscular
power
so
great
that
i
do
not
hesitate
to
look
upon
it
as
a
second
sign
of
the
unusualness
that
marks
the
whole
tragedy
and
why
move
that
enormous
stone
to
finish
off
the
victim
when
a
mere
pebble
would
have
done
the
work
why
again
was
the
murderer
not
killed
or
at
least
reduced
to
a
temporary
state
of
helplessness
in
the
terrible
somersault
turned
by
the
car
how
did
he
disappear
and
why
having
disappeared
did
he
return
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
why
did
he
throw
his
fur
coat
there
then
on
another
day
his
cap
then
on
another
day
his
goggles
unusual
useless
stupid
acts
why
besides
convey
that
wounded
dying
woman
on
the
seat
of
the
car
where
everybody
could
see
her
why
do
that
instead
of
putting
her
inside
or
flinging
her
into
some
corner
dead
just
as
the
man
was
flung
under
the
brambles
in
the
ditch
unusualness
stupidity
everything
in
the
whole
story
is
absurd
everything
points
to
hesitation
incoherency
awkwardness
the
silliness
of
a
child
or
rather
of
a
mad
blundering
savage
of
a
brute
look
at
the
bottle
of
brandy
there
was
a
corkscrew
it
was
found
in
the
pocket
of
the
great
coat
did
the
murderer
use
it
yes
the
marks
of
the
corkscrew
can
be
seen
on
the
seal
but
the
operation
was
too
complicated
for
him
he
broke
the
neck
with
a
stone
always
stones
observe
that
detail
they
are
the
only
weapon
the
only
implement
which
the
creature
employs
it
is
his
customary
weapon
his
familiar
implement
he
kills
the
man
with
a
stone
he
kills
the
woman
with
a
stone
and
he
opens
bottles
with
a
stone
a
brute
i
repeat
a
savage
disordered
unhinged
suddenly
driven
mad
by
what
why
of
course
by
that
same
brandy
which
he
swallowed
at
a
draught
while
the
driver
and
his
companion
were
having
breakfast
in
the
field
he
got
out
of
the
limousine
in
which
he
was
travelling
in
his
coat
and
his
fur
cap
took
the
bottle
broke
off
the
neck
and
drank
there
is
the
whole
story
having
drunk
he
went
raving
mad
and
hit
out
at
random
without
reason
then
seized
with
instinctive
fear
dreading
the
inevitable
punishment
he
hid
the
body
of
the
man
then
like
an
idiot
he
took
up
the
wounded
woman
and
ran
away
he
ran
away
in
that
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
work
but
which
to
him
represented
safety
escape
from
capture
but
the
money
you
will
ask
the
stolen
why
who
says
that
he
was
the
thief
who
says
that
it
was
not
some
passing
tramp
some
labourer
guided
by
the
stench
of
the
corpse
very
well
you
object
but
the
brute
would
have
been
found
as
he
is
hiding
somewhere
near
the
turn
and
as
after
all
he
must
eat
and
drink
well
well
i
see
that
you
have
not
yet
understood
the
simplest
way
i
suppose
to
have
done
and
to
answer
your
objections
is
to
make
straight
for
the
mark
then
let
the
gentlemen
of
the
police
and
the
gendarmerie
themselves
make
straight
for
the
mark
let
them
take
firearms
let
them
explore
the
forest
within
a
radius
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
from
the
turn
no
more
but
instead
of
exploring
with
their
heads
down
and
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
let
them
look
up
into
the
air
yes
into
the
air
among
the
leaves
and
branches
of
the
tallest
oaks
and
the
most
unlikely
beeches
and
believe
me
they
will
see
him
for
he
is
there
he
is
there
bewildered
piteously
at
a
loss
seeking
for
the
man
and
woman
whom
he
has
killed
looking
for
them
and
waiting
for
them
and
not
daring
to
go
away
and
quite
unable
to
understand
i
myself
am
exceedingly
sorry
that
i
am
kept
in
town
by
urgent
private
affairs
and
by
some
complicated
matters
of
business
which
i
have
to
set
going
for
i
should
much
have
liked
to
see
the
end
of
this
rather
curious
adventure
pray
therefore
excuse
me
to
my
kind
friends
in
the
police
and
permit
me
to
be
sir
your
obedient
servant
arsène
lupin
the
upshot
will
be
remembered
the
gentlemen
of
the
police
and
the
gendarmerie
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
paid
no
attention
to
this
lucubration
but
four
of
the
local
country
gentry
took
their
rifles
and
went
shooting
with
their
eyes
fixed
skyward
as
though
they
meant
to
pot
a
few
rooks
in
half
an
hour
they
had
caught
sight
of
the
murderer
two
shots
and
he
came
tumbling
from
bough
to
bough
he
was
only
wounded
and
they
took
him
alive
that
evening
a
paris
paper
which
did
not
yet
know
of
the
capture
printed
the
following
paragraphs
enquiries
are
being
made
after
a
and
mme
bragoff
who
landed
at
marseilles
six
weeks
ago
and
there
hired
a
they
had
been
living
in
australia
for
many
years
during
which
time
they
had
not
visited
europe
and
they
wrote
to
the
director
of
the
jardin
with
whom
they
were
in
the
habit
of
corresponding
that
they
were
bringing
with
them
a
curious
creature
of
an
entirely
unknown
species
of
which
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
monkey
according
to
bragoff
who
is
an
eminent
archæologist
the
specimen
in
question
is
the
anthropoid
ape
or
rather
the
the
existence
of
which
had
not
hitherto
been
definitely
proved
the
structure
is
said
to
be
exactly
similar
to
that
of
discovered
by
dubois
in
java
in
this
curious
intelligent
and
observant
animal
acted
as
its
owner
servant
on
their
property
in
australia
and
used
to
clean
their
and
even
attempt
to
drive
it
the
question
that
is
being
asked
is
where
are
and
mme
bragoff
where
is
the
strange
primate
that
landed
with
them
at
marseilles
the
answer
to
this
question
was
now
made
easy
thanks
to
the
hints
supplied
by
arsène
lupin
all
the
elements
of
the
tragedy
were
known
thanks
to
him
the
culprit
was
in
the
hands
of
the
law
you
can
see
him
at
the
jardin
where
he
is
locked
up
under
the
name
of
three
stars
he
is
in
point
of
fact
a
monkey
but
he
is
also
a
man
he
has
the
gentleness
and
the
wisdom
of
the
domestic
animals
and
the
sadness
which
they
feel
when
their
master
dies
but
he
has
many
other
qualities
that
bring
him
much
closer
to
humanity
he
is
treacherous
cruel
idle
greedy
and
quarrelsome
and
above
all
he
is
immoderately
fond
of
brandy
apart
from
that
he
is
a
monkey
unless
indeed
a
few
days
after
three
stars
arrest
i
saw
arsène
lupin
standing
in
front
of
his
cage
lupin
was
manifestly
trying
to
solve
this
interesting
problem
for
himself
i
at
once
said
for
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
having
the
matter
out
with
him
you
know
lupin
that
intervention
of
yours
your
argument
your
letter
in
short
did
not
surprise
me
so
much
as
you
might
think
oh
really
he
said
calmly
and
why
why
because
the
incident
has
occurred
before
seventy
or
eighty
years
ago
edgar
allan
poe
made
it
the
subject
of
one
of
his
finest
tales
in
those
circumstances
the
key
to
the
riddle
was
easy
enough
to
find
arsène
lupin
took
my
arm
and
walking
away
with
me
said
when
did
you
guess
it
yourself
on
reading
your
letter
i
confessed
and
at
what
part
of
my
letter
at
the
end
at
the
end
eh
after
i
had
dotted
all
the
i
so
here
is
a
crime
which
accident
causes
to
be
repeated
under
quite
different
conditions
it
is
true
but
still
with
the
same
sort
of
hero
and
your
eyes
had
to
be
opened
as
well
as
other
people
it
needed
the
assistance
of
my
letter
the
letter
in
which
i
amused
myself
apart
from
the
exigencies
of
the
facts
by
employing
the
argument
and
sometimes
the
identical
words
used
by
the
american
poet
in
a
story
which
everybody
has
read
so
you
see
that
my
letter
was
not
absolutely
useless
and
that
one
may
safely
venture
to
repeat
to
people
things
which
they
have
learnt
only
to
forget
them
wherewith
lupin
turned
on
his
heel
and
burst
out
laughing
in
the
face
of
an
old
monkey
who
sat
with
the
air
of
a
philosopher
gravely
meditating

lupin
marriage
monsieur
arsène
lupin
has
the
honour
to
inform
you
of
his
approaching
marriage
with
mademoiselle
angélique
de
princesse
de
and
to
request
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
the
wedding
which
will
take
place
at
the
church
of
the
duc
de
has
the
honour
to
inform
you
of
the
approaching
marriage
of
his
daughter
angélique
princesse
de
with
monsieur
arsène
lupin
and
to
request
jean
duc
de
could
not
finish
reading
the
invitations
which
he
held
in
his
trembling
hand
pale
with
anger
his
long
lean
body
shaking
with
tremors
there
he
gasped
handing
the
two
communications
to
his
daughter
this
is
what
our
friends
have
received
this
has
been
the
talk
of
paris
since
yesterday
what
do
you
say
to
that
dastardly
insult
angélique
what
would
your
poor
mother
say
to
it
if
she
were
alive
angélique
was
tall
and
thin
like
her
father
skinny
and
angular
like
him
she
was
years
of
age
always
dressed
in
black
stuff
shy
and
retiring
in
manner
with
a
head
too
small
in
proportion
to
her
height
and
narrowed
on
either
side
until
the
nose
seemed
to
jut
forth
in
protest
against
such
parsimony
and
yet
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
that
she
was
ugly
for
her
eyes
were
extremely
beautiful
soft
and
grave
proud
and
a
little
sad
pathetic
eyes
which
to
see
once
was
to
remember
she
flushed
with
shame
at
hearing
her
father
words
which
told
her
the
scandal
of
which
she
was
the
victim
but
as
she
loved
him
notwithstanding
his
harshness
to
her
his
injustice
and
despotism
she
said
oh
i
think
it
must
be
meant
for
a
joke
father
to
which
we
need
pay
no
attention
a
joke
why
every
one
is
gossiping
about
it
a
dozen
papers
have
printed
the
confounded
notice
this
morning
with
satirical
comments
they
quote
our
pedigree
our
ancestors
our
illustrious
dead
they
pretend
to
take
the
thing
seriously
still
no
one
could
believe
of
course
not
but
that
does
prevent
us
from
being
the
of
paris
it
will
all
be
forgotten
by
my
girl
people
will
remember
that
the
name
of
angélique
de
has
been
bandied
about
as
it
should
not
be
oh
if
i
could
find
out
the
name
of
the
scoundrel
who
has
dared
at
that
moment
hyacinthe
the
duke
valet
came
in
and
said
that
monsieur
le
duc
was
wanted
on
the
telephone
still
fuming
he
took
down
the
receiver
and
growled
well
who
is
it
yes
it
the
duc
de
speaking
a
voice
replied
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
monsieur
le
duc
and
to
mlle
angélique
it
my
secretary
fault
your
secretary
yes
the
invitations
were
only
a
rough
draft
which
i
meant
to
submit
to
you
unfortunately
my
secretary
thought
but
tell
me
monsieur
who
are
you
what
monsieur
le
duc
do
you
know
my
voice
the
voice
of
your
future
what
arsène
lupin
the
duke
dropped
into
a
chair
his
face
was
livid
arsène
lupin
it
he
arsène
lupin
angélique
gave
a
smile
you
see
father
it
only
a
joke
a
hoax
but
the
duke
rage
broke
out
afresh
and
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
moving
his
arms
i
shall
go
to
the
police
the
fellow
ca
be
allowed
to
make
a
fool
of
me
in
this
way
if
there
any
law
left
in
the
land
it
must
be
stopped
hyacinthe
entered
the
room
again
he
brought
two
chotois
lepetit
do
know
them
they
are
both
journalists
monsieur
le
duc
what
do
they
want
they
would
like
to
speak
to
monsieur
le
duc
with
regard
to
the
marriage
turn
them
out
exclaimed
the
duke
kick
them
out
and
tell
the
porter
not
to
admit
scum
of
that
sort
to
my
house
in
future
please
father
angélique
ventured
to
say
as
for
you
shut
up
if
you
had
consented
to
marry
one
of
your
cousins
when
i
wanted
you
to
this
would
have
happened
the
same
evening
one
of
the
two
reporters
printed
on
the
front
page
of
his
paper
a
somewhat
fanciful
story
of
his
expedition
to
the
family
mansion
of
the
in
the
rue
de
varennes
and
expatiated
pleasantly
upon
the
old
nobleman
wrathful
protests
the
next
morning
another
newspaper
published
an
interview
with
arsène
lupin
which
was
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
a
lobby
at
the
opera
arsène
lupin
retorted
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
i
share
my
prospective
indignation
to
the
full
the
sending
out
of
the
invitations
was
a
gross
breach
of
etiquette
for
which
i
am
not
responsible
but
for
which
i
wish
to
make
a
public
apology
why
sir
the
date
of
the
marriage
is
not
yet
fixed
my
bride
father
suggests
early
in
may
she
and
i
think
that
six
weeks
is
really
too
long
to
wait
that
which
gave
a
special
piquancy
to
the
affair
and
added
immensely
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
friends
of
the
family
was
the
duke
character
his
pride
and
the
uncompromising
nature
of
his
ideas
and
principles
duc
jean
was
the
last
descendant
of
the
barons
de
sarzeau
the
most
ancient
family
in
brittany
he
was
the
lineal
descendant
of
that
sarzeau
who
upon
marrying
a
vendôme
refused
to
bear
the
new
title
which
louis
xv
forced
upon
him
until
after
he
had
been
imprisoned
for
ten
years
in
the
bastille
and
he
had
abandoned
none
of
the
prejudices
of
the
old
régime
in
his
youth
he
followed
the
comte
de
chambord
into
exile
in
his
old
age
he
refused
a
seat
in
the
chamber
on
the
pretext
that
a
sarzeau
could
only
sit
with
his
peers
the
incident
stung
him
to
the
quick
nothing
could
pacify
him
he
cursed
lupin
in
good
round
terms
threatened
him
with
every
sort
of
punishment
and
rounded
on
his
daughter
there
if
you
had
only
married
after
all
you
had
plenty
of
chances
your
three
cousins
mussy
and
caorches
are
noblemen
of
good
descent
allied
to
the
best
families
fairly
and
they
are
still
anxious
to
marry
you
why
do
you
refuse
them
ah
because
miss
is
a
dreamer
a
sentimentalist
and
because
her
cousins
are
too
fat
or
too
thin
or
too
coarse
for
her
she
was
in
fact
a
dreamer
left
to
her
own
devices
from
childhood
she
had
read
all
the
books
of
chivalry
all
the
colourless
romances
of
that
littered
the
ancestral
presses
and
she
looked
upon
life
as
a
in
which
the
beauteous
maidens
are
always
happy
while
the
others
wait
till
death
for
the
bridegroom
who
does
not
come
why
should
she
marry
one
of
her
cousins
when
they
were
only
after
her
money
the
millions
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
mother
she
might
as
well
remain
an
old
maid
and
go
on
dreaming
she
answered
gently
you
will
end
by
making
yourself
ill
father
forget
this
silly
business
but
how
could
he
forget
it
every
morning
some
renewed
his
wound
three
days
running
angélique
received
a
wonderful
sheaf
of
flowers
with
arsène
lupin
card
peeping
from
it
the
duke
could
not
go
to
his
club
but
a
friend
accosted
him
that
was
a
good
one
what
was
why
your
latest
have
you
seen
it
here
read
it
for
yourself
arsène
lupin
is
petitioning
the
council
of
state
for
permission
to
add
his
wife
name
to
his
own
and
to
be
known
henceforth
as
lupin
de
and
the
next
day
he
read
as
the
young
bride
by
virtue
of
an
unrepealed
decree
of
charles
x
bears
the
title
and
arms
of
the
of
whom
she
is
the
the
eldest
son
of
the
lupins
de
will
be
styled
prince
de
and
the
day
after
an
advertisement
exhibition
of
mlle
de
trousseau
at
great
linen
warehouse
each
article
marked
with
initials
then
an
illustrated
paper
published
a
photographic
scene
the
duke
his
daughter
and
his
sitting
at
a
table
playing
and
the
date
also
was
announced
with
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
the
of
may
and
particulars
were
given
of
the
lupin
showed
himself
wonderfully
disinterested
he
was
prepared
to
sign
the
newspapers
said
with
his
eyes
closed
without
knowing
the
figure
of
the
dowry
all
these
things
drove
the
old
duke
crazy
his
hatred
of
lupin
assumed
morbid
proportions
much
as
it
went
against
the
grain
he
called
on
the
prefect
of
police
who
advised
him
to
be
on
his
guard
we
know
the
gentleman
ways
he
is
employing
one
of
his
favourite
dodges
forgive
the
expression
monsieur
le
duc
but
he
is
you
do
fall
into
the
trap
what
dodge
what
trap
asked
the
duke
anxiously
he
is
trying
to
make
you
lose
your
head
and
to
lead
you
by
intimidation
to
do
something
which
you
would
refuse
to
do
in
cold
blood
still
arsène
lupin
can
hardly
hope
that
i
will
offer
him
my
daughter
hand
no
but
he
hopes
that
you
will
commit
to
put
it
mildly
a
blunder
what
blunder
exactly
that
blunder
which
he
wants
you
to
commit
then
you
think
monsieur
le
préfet
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
monsieur
le
duc
is
to
go
home
or
if
all
this
excitement
worries
you
to
run
down
to
the
country
and
stay
there
quietly
without
upsetting
yourself
this
conversation
only
increased
the
old
duke
fears
lupin
appeared
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
terrible
person
who
employed
diabolical
methods
and
kept
accomplices
in
every
sphere
of
society
prudence
was
the
watchword
and
life
from
that
moment
became
intolerable
the
duke
grew
more
crabbed
and
silent
than
ever
and
denied
his
door
to
all
his
old
friends
and
even
to
angélique
three
suitors
her
cousins
de
mussy
and
de
caorches
who
were
none
of
them
on
speaking
terms
with
the
others
in
consequence
of
their
rivalry
and
who
were
in
the
habit
of
calling
turn
and
turn
about
every
week
for
no
earthly
reason
he
dismissed
his
butler
and
his
coachman
but
he
dared
not
fill
their
places
for
fear
of
engaging
creatures
of
arsène
lupin
and
his
own
man
hyacinthe
in
whom
he
had
every
confidence
having
had
him
in
his
service
for
over
forty
years
had
to
take
upon
himself
the
laborious
duties
of
the
stables
and
the
pantry
come
father
said
angélique
trying
to
make
him
listen
to
i
really
ca
see
what
you
are
afraid
of
no
one
can
force
me
into
this
ridiculous
marriage
well
of
course
that
not
what
i
afraid
of
what
then
father
how
can
i
tell
an
abduction
a
burglary
an
act
of
violence
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
villain
is
scheming
something
and
there
is
also
no
doubt
that
we
are
surrounded
by
spies
one
afternoon
he
received
a
newspaper
in
which
the
following
paragraph
was
marked
in
red
pencil
the
signing
of
the
is
fixed
for
this
evening
at
the
it
will
be
quite
a
private
ceremony
and
only
a
few
privileged
friends
will
be
present
to
congratulate
the
happy
pair
the
witnesses
to
the
contract
on
behalf
of
mlle
de
the
prince
de
la
and
the
comte
de
chartres
will
be
introduced
by
arsène
lupin
to
the
two
gentlemen
who
have
claimed
the
honour
of
acting
as
his
groomsmen
namely
the
prefect
of
police
and
the
governor
of
the
santé
prison
ten
minutes
later
the
duke
sent
his
servant
hyacinthe
to
the
post
with
three
express
messages
at
four
in
angélique
presence
he
saw
the
three
cousins
mussy
fat
heavy
slender
and
shy
caorches
short
thin
and
all
three
old
bachelors
by
this
time
lacking
distinction
in
dress
or
appearance
the
meeting
was
a
short
one
the
duke
had
worked
out
his
whole
plan
of
campaign
a
defensive
campaign
of
which
he
set
forth
the
first
stage
in
explicit
terms
angélique
and
i
will
leave
paris
for
our
place
in
brittany
i
rely
on
you
my
three
nephews
to
help
us
get
away
you
will
come
and
fetch
us
in
your
car
with
the
hood
up
you
mussy
will
bring
your
big
motor
and
kindly
see
to
the
luggage
with
hyacinthe
my
man
you
caorches
will
go
to
the
gare
and
book
our
berths
in
the
for
vannes
by
the
train
is
that
settled
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
without
incident
the
duke
to
avoid
any
accidental
indiscretion
waited
until
after
dinner
to
tell
hyacinthe
to
pack
a
trunk
and
a
portmanteau
hyacinthe
was
to
accompany
them
as
well
as
angélique
maid
at
nine
all
the
other
servants
went
to
bed
by
their
order
at
ten
minutes
to
ten
the
duke
who
was
completing
his
preparations
heard
the
sound
of
a
the
porter
opened
the
gates
of
the
courtyard
the
duke
standing
at
the
window
recognized
landaulette
tell
him
i
shall
be
down
presently
he
said
to
hyacinthe
and
let
mademoiselle
know
in
a
few
minutes
as
hyacinthe
did
not
return
he
left
his
room
but
he
was
attacked
on
the
landing
by
two
masked
men
who
gagged
and
bound
him
before
he
could
utter
a
cry
and
one
of
the
men
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
take
this
as
a
first
warning
monsieur
le
duc
if
you
persist
in
leaving
paris
and
refusing
your
consent
it
will
be
a
more
serious
matter
and
the
same
man
said
to
his
companion
keep
an
eye
on
him
i
will
see
to
the
young
lady
by
that
time
two
other
confederates
had
secured
the
lady
maid
and
angélique
herself
gagged
lay
fainting
on
a
couch
in
her
boudoir
she
came
to
almost
immediately
under
the
stimulus
of
a
bottle
of
salts
held
to
her
nostrils
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
bending
over
her
a
young
man
in
with
a
smiling
and
friendly
face
who
said
i
implore
your
forgiveness
mademoiselle
all
these
happenings
are
a
trifle
sudden
and
this
behaviour
rather
out
of
the
way
but
circumstances
often
compel
us
to
deeds
of
which
our
conscience
does
not
approve
pray
pardon
me
he
took
her
hand
very
gently
and
slipped
a
broad
gold
ring
on
the
finger
saying
there
now
we
are
engaged
never
forget
the
man
who
gave
you
this
ring
he
entreats
you
not
to
run
away
from
him
and
to
stay
in
paris
and
await
the
proofs
of
his
devotion
have
faith
in
him
he
said
all
this
in
so
serious
and
respectful
a
voice
with
so
much
authority
and
deference
that
she
had
not
the
strength
to
resist
their
eyes
met
he
whispered
the
exquisite
purity
of
your
eyes
it
would
be
heavenly
to
live
with
those
eyes
upon
one
now
close
them
he
withdrew
his
accomplices
followed
suit
the
car
drove
off
and
the
house
in
the
rue
de
varennes
remained
still
and
silent
until
the
moment
when
angélique
regaining
complete
consciousness
called
out
for
the
servants
they
found
the
duke
hyacinthe
the
lady
maid
and
the
porter
and
his
wife
all
tightly
bound
a
few
priceless
ornaments
had
disappeared
as
well
as
the
duke
and
all
his
jewellery
tie
pins
pearl
studs
watch
and
so
on
the
police
were
advised
without
delay
in
the
morning
it
appeared
that
on
the
evening
before
when
leaving
his
house
in
the
was
stabbed
by
his
own
chauffeur
and
thrown
into
a
deserted
street
mussy
and
caorches
had
each
received
a
purporting
to
come
from
the
duke
countermanding
their
attendance
next
week
without
troubling
further
about
the
police
investigation
without
obeying
the
summons
of
the
without
even
reading
arsène
lupin
letters
to
the
papers
on
the
varennes
flight
the
duke
his
daughter
and
his
valet
stealthily
took
a
slow
train
for
vannes
and
arrived
one
evening
at
the
old
feudal
castle
that
towers
over
the
headland
of
sarzeau
the
duke
at
once
organized
a
defence
with
the
aid
of
the
breton
peasants
true
mediæval
vassals
to
a
man
on
the
fourth
day
mussy
arrived
on
the
fifth
caorches
and
on
the
seventh
whose
wound
was
not
as
severe
as
had
been
feared
the
duke
waited
two
days
longer
before
communicating
to
those
about
him
what
now
that
his
escape
had
succeeded
in
spite
of
lupin
he
called
the
second
part
of
his
plan
he
did
so
in
the
presence
of
the
three
cousins
by
a
dictatorial
order
to
angélique
expressed
in
these
peremptory
terms
all
this
bother
is
upsetting
me
terribly
i
have
entered
on
a
struggle
with
this
man
whose
daring
you
have
seen
for
yourself
and
the
struggle
is
killing
me
i
want
to
end
it
at
all
costs
there
is
only
one
way
of
doing
so
angélique
and
that
is
for
you
to
release
me
from
all
responsibility
by
accepting
the
hand
of
one
of
your
cousins
before
a
month
is
out
you
must
be
the
wife
of
mussy
caorches
or
you
have
a
free
choice
make
your
decision
for
four
whole
days
angélique
wept
and
entreated
her
father
but
in
vain
she
felt
that
he
would
be
inflexible
and
that
she
must
end
by
submitting
to
his
wishes
she
accepted
whichever
you
please
father
i
love
none
of
them
so
i
may
as
well
be
unhappy
with
one
as
with
the
other
thereupon
a
fresh
discussion
ensued
as
the
duke
wanted
to
compel
her
to
make
her
own
choice
she
stood
firm
reluctantly
and
for
financial
considerations
he
named
the
banns
were
published
without
delay
from
that
moment
the
watch
in
and
around
the
castle
was
increased
twofold
all
the
more
inasmuch
as
lupin
silence
and
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
campaign
which
he
had
been
conducting
in
the
press
could
not
but
alarm
the
duc
de
it
was
obvious
that
the
enemy
was
getting
ready
to
strike
and
would
endeavour
to
oppose
the
marriage
by
one
of
his
characteristic
moves
nevertheless
nothing
happened
nothing
two
days
before
the
ceremony
nothing
on
the
day
before
nothing
on
the
morning
itself
the
marriage
took
place
in
the
mayor
office
followed
by
the
religious
celebration
in
church
and
the
thing
was
done
then
and
not
till
then
the
duke
breathed
freely
notwithstanding
his
daughter
sadness
notwithstanding
the
embarrassed
silence
of
his
who
found
the
situation
a
little
trying
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
an
air
of
pleasure
as
though
he
had
achieved
a
brilliant
victory
tell
them
to
lower
the
drawbridge
he
said
to
hyacinthe
and
to
admit
everybody
we
have
nothing
more
to
fear
from
that
scoundrel
after
the
he
had
wine
served
out
to
the
peasants
and
clinked
glasses
with
them
they
danced
and
sang
at
three
he
returned
to
the
rooms
it
was
the
hour
for
his
afternoon
nap
he
walked
to
the
at
the
end
of
the
suite
but
he
had
no
sooner
placed
his
foot
on
the
threshold
than
he
stopped
suddenly
and
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
here
is
this
a
joke
was
standing
before
him
dressed
as
a
breton
fisherman
in
a
dirty
jacket
and
breeches
torn
patched
and
many
sizes
too
large
for
him
the
duke
seemed
dumbfounded
he
stared
with
eyes
of
amazement
at
that
face
which
he
knew
and
which
at
the
same
time
roused
memories
of
a
very
distant
past
within
his
brain
then
he
strode
abruptly
to
one
of
the
windows
overlooking
the
and
called
angélique
what
is
it
father
she
asked
coming
forward
where
your
husband
over
there
father
said
angélique
pointing
to
who
was
smoking
a
cigarette
and
reading
some
way
off
the
duke
stumbled
and
fell
into
a
chair
with
a
great
shudder
of
fright
oh
i
shall
go
mad
but
the
man
in
the
fisherman
garb
knelt
down
before
him
and
said
look
at
me
uncle
you
know
me
do
you
i
your
nephew
the
one
who
used
to
play
here
in
the
old
days
the
one
whom
you
called
jacquot
just
think
a
minute
here
look
at
this
scar
yes
yes
stammered
the
duke
i
recognize
you
it
jacques
but
the
other
one
he
put
his
hands
to
his
head
and
yet
no
it
ca
be
explain
yourself
i
understand
i
do
want
to
understand
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
newcomer
shut
the
window
and
closed
the
door
leading
to
the
next
room
then
he
came
up
to
the
old
duke
touched
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
to
wake
him
from
his
torpor
and
without
further
preface
as
though
to
cut
short
any
explanation
that
was
not
absolutely
necessary
spoke
as
follows
four
years
ago
that
is
to
say
in
the
eleventh
year
of
my
voluntary
exile
when
i
settled
in
the
extreme
south
of
algeria
i
made
the
acquaintance
in
the
course
of
a
arranged
by
a
big
arab
chief
of
a
man
whose
geniality
whose
charm
of
manner
whose
consummate
prowess
whose
indomitable
pluck
whose
combined
humour
and
depth
of
mind
fascinated
me
in
the
highest
degree
the
comte
spent
six
weeks
as
my
guest
after
he
left
we
kept
up
a
correspondence
at
regular
intervals
i
also
often
saw
his
name
in
the
papers
in
the
society
and
sporting
columns
he
was
to
come
back
and
i
was
preparing
to
receive
him
three
months
ago
when
one
evening
as
i
was
out
riding
my
two
arab
attendants
flung
themselves
upon
me
bound
me
blindfolded
me
and
took
me
travelling
day
and
night
for
a
week
along
deserted
roads
to
a
bay
on
the
coast
where
five
men
awaited
them
i
was
at
once
carried
on
board
a
small
which
weighed
anchor
without
delay
there
was
nothing
to
tell
me
who
the
men
were
nor
what
their
object
was
in
kidnapping
me
they
had
locked
me
into
a
narrow
cabin
secured
by
a
massive
door
and
lighted
by
a
protected
by
two
iron
every
morning
a
hand
was
inserted
through
a
hatch
between
the
next
cabin
and
my
own
and
placed
on
my
bunk
two
or
three
pounds
of
bread
a
good
helping
of
food
and
a
flagon
of
wine
and
removed
the
remains
of
yesterday
meals
which
i
put
there
for
the
purpose
from
time
to
time
at
night
the
yacht
stopped
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
boat
rowing
to
some
harbour
and
then
returning
doubtless
with
provisions
then
we
set
out
once
more
without
hurrying
as
though
on
a
cruise
of
people
of
our
class
who
travel
for
pleasure
and
are
not
pressed
for
time
sometimes
standing
on
a
chair
i
would
see
the
coastline
through
my
too
indistinctly
however
to
locate
it
and
this
lasted
for
weeks
one
morning
in
the
ninth
week
i
perceived
that
the
hatch
had
been
left
unfastened
and
i
pushed
it
open
the
cabin
was
empty
at
the
time
with
an
effort
i
was
able
to
take
a
from
a
two
weeks
after
that
by
dint
of
patient
perseverance
i
had
succeeded
in
filing
through
the
bars
of
my
and
i
could
have
escaped
that
way
only
though
i
am
a
good
swimmer
i
soon
grow
tired
i
had
therefore
to
choose
a
moment
when
the
yacht
was
not
too
far
from
the
land
it
was
not
until
yesterday
that
perched
on
my
chair
i
caught
sight
of
the
coast
and
in
the
evening
at
sunset
i
recognized
to
my
astonishment
the
outlines
of
the
château
de
sarzeau
with
its
pointed
turrets
and
its
square
keep
i
wondered
if
this
was
the
goal
of
my
mysterious
voyage
all
night
long
we
cruised
in
the
offing
the
same
all
day
yesterday
at
last
this
morning
we
put
in
at
a
distance
which
i
considered
favourable
all
the
more
so
as
we
were
steaming
through
rocks
under
cover
of
which
i
could
swim
unobserved
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
make
my
escape
i
noticed
that
the
shutter
of
the
hatch
which
they
thought
they
had
closed
had
once
more
opened
of
itself
and
was
flapping
against
the
partition
i
again
pushed
it
ajar
from
curiosity
within
arm
length
was
a
little
cupboard
which
i
managed
to
open
and
in
which
my
hand
groping
at
random
laid
hold
of
a
bundle
of
papers
this
consisted
of
letters
letters
containing
instructions
addressed
to
the
pirates
who
held
me
prisoner
an
hour
later
when
i
wriggled
through
the
and
slipped
into
the
sea
i
knew
all
the
reasons
for
my
abduction
the
means
employed
the
object
in
view
and
the
infamous
scheme
plotted
during
the
last
three
months
against
the
duc
de
and
his
daughter
unfortunately
it
was
too
late
i
was
obliged
in
order
not
to
be
seen
from
the
yacht
to
crouch
in
the
cleft
of
a
rock
and
did
not
reach
land
until
by
the
time
that
i
had
been
to
a
cabin
exchanged
my
clothes
for
his
and
come
on
here
it
was
three
on
my
arrival
i
learnt
that
angélique
marriage
was
celebrated
this
morning
the
old
duke
had
not
spoken
a
word
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
stranger
he
was
listening
in
dismay
at
times
the
thought
of
the
warnings
given
him
by
the
prefect
of
police
returned
to
his
mind
they
nursing
you
monsieur
le
duc
they
are
nursing
you
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
speak
on
finish
your
story
all
this
is
ghastly
i
understand
it
yet
and
i
feel
nervous
the
stranger
resumed
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
story
is
easily
pieced
together
and
is
summed
up
in
a
few
sentences
it
is
like
this
the
comte
remembered
several
things
from
his
stay
with
me
and
from
the
confidences
which
i
was
foolish
enough
to
make
to
him
first
of
all
i
was
your
nephew
and
yet
you
had
seen
comparatively
little
of
me
because
i
left
sarzeau
when
i
was
quite
a
child
and
since
then
our
intercourse
was
limited
to
the
few
weeks
which
i
spent
here
fifteen
years
ago
when
i
proposed
for
the
hand
of
my
cousin
angélique
secondly
having
broken
with
the
past
i
received
no
letters
lastly
there
was
a
certain
physical
resemblance
between
and
myself
which
could
be
accentuated
to
such
an
extent
as
to
become
striking
his
scheme
was
built
up
on
those
three
points
he
bribed
my
arab
servants
to
give
him
warning
in
case
i
left
algeria
then
he
went
back
to
paris
bearing
my
name
and
made
up
to
look
exactly
like
me
came
to
see
you
was
invited
to
your
house
once
a
fortnight
and
lived
under
my
name
which
thus
became
one
of
the
many
aliases
beneath
which
he
conceals
his
real
identity
three
months
ago
when
apple
was
ripe
as
he
says
in
his
letters
he
began
the
attack
by
a
series
of
communications
to
the
press
and
at
the
same
time
fearing
no
doubt
that
some
newspaper
would
tell
me
in
algeria
the
part
that
was
being
played
under
my
name
in
paris
he
had
me
assaulted
by
my
servants
and
kidnapped
by
his
confederates
i
need
not
explain
any
more
in
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
uncle
the
duc
de
was
shaken
with
a
fit
of
nervous
trembling
the
awful
truth
to
which
he
refused
to
open
his
eyes
appeared
to
him
in
its
nakedness
and
assumed
the
hateful
countenance
of
the
enemy
he
clutched
his
nephew
hands
and
said
to
him
fiercely
despairingly
it
lupin
is
it
not
yes
uncle
and
it
to
him
it
to
him
that
i
have
given
my
daughter
yes
uncle
to
him
who
has
stolen
my
name
of
jacques
from
me
and
stolen
your
daughter
from
you
angélique
is
the
wedded
wife
of
arsène
lupin
and
that
in
accordance
with
your
orders
this
letter
in
his
handwriting
bears
witness
to
it
he
has
upset
your
whole
life
thrown
you
off
your
balance
besieging
your
hours
of
waking
and
your
nights
of
dreaming
rifling
your
until
the
moment
when
seized
with
terror
you
took
refuge
here
where
thinking
that
you
would
escape
his
artifices
and
his
rapacity
you
told
your
daughter
to
choose
one
of
her
three
cousins
mussy
or
caorches
as
her
husband
but
why
did
she
select
that
one
rather
than
the
others
it
was
you
who
selected
him
uncle
at
random
because
he
had
the
biggest
income
no
not
at
random
but
on
the
insidious
persistent
and
very
clever
advice
of
your
servant
hyacinthe
the
duke
gave
a
start
what
is
hyacinthe
an
accomplice
no
not
of
arsène
lupin
but
of
the
man
whom
he
believes
to
be
and
who
promised
to
give
him
a
hundred
thousand
francs
within
a
week
after
the
marriage
oh
the
villain
he
planned
everything
foresaw
everything
foresaw
everything
uncle
down
to
shamming
an
attempt
upon
his
life
so
as
to
avert
suspicion
down
to
shamming
a
wound
received
in
your
service
but
with
what
object
why
all
these
dastardly
tricks
angélique
has
a
fortune
of
eleven
million
francs
your
solicitor
in
paris
was
to
hand
the
securities
next
week
to
the
counterfeit
who
had
only
to
realize
them
forthwith
and
disappear
but
this
very
morning
you
yourself
were
to
hand
your
as
a
personal
five
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
which
he
has
arranged
to
deliver
to
one
of
his
accomplices
at
nine
this
evening
outside
the
castle
near
the
great
oak
so
that
they
may
be
negotiated
morning
in
brussels
the
duc
de
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
was
stamping
furiously
up
and
down
the
room
at
nine
this
evening
he
said
we
see
about
that
see
about
that
i
have
the
gendarmes
here
before
then
arsène
lupin
laughs
at
gendarmes
let
telegraph
to
paris
yes
but
how
about
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
and
still
worse
uncle
the
scandal
think
of
this
your
daughter
angélique
de
married
to
that
swindler
that
thief
no
no
it
would
never
do
what
then
what
the
nephew
now
rose
and
stepping
to
a
took
down
a
rifle
and
laid
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
duke
away
in
algeria
uncle
on
the
verge
of
the
desert
when
we
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
a
wild
beast
we
do
not
send
for
the
gendarmes
we
take
our
rifle
and
we
shoot
the
wild
beast
otherwise
the
beast
would
tear
us
to
pieces
with
its
claws
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
over
there
i
acquired
the
habit
of
dispensing
with
the
gendarmes
it
is
a
rather
summary
way
of
doing
justice
but
it
is
the
best
way
believe
me
and
in
the
present
case
it
is
the
only
way
once
the
beast
is
killed
you
and
i
will
bury
it
in
some
corner
unseen
and
unknown
and
angélique
we
will
tell
her
later
what
will
become
of
her
she
will
be
my
wife
the
wife
of
the
real
i
desert
her
and
return
to
algeria
the
divorce
will
be
granted
in
two
months
time
the
duke
listened
pale
and
staring
with
set
jaws
he
whispered
are
you
sure
that
his
accomplices
on
the
yacht
will
not
inform
him
of
your
escape
not
before
so
that
so
that
inevitably
at
nine
this
evening
arsène
lupin
on
his
way
to
the
great
oak
will
take
the
that
follows
the
old
ramparts
and
skirts
the
ruins
of
the
chapel
i
shall
be
there
in
the
ruins
i
shall
be
there
too
said
the
duc
de
quietly
taking
down
a
gun
it
was
now
five
the
duke
talked
some
time
longer
to
his
nephew
examined
the
weapons
loaded
them
with
fresh
cartridges
then
when
night
came
he
took
through
the
dark
passages
to
his
bedroom
and
hid
him
in
an
adjoining
closet
nothing
further
happened
until
dinner
the
duke
forced
himself
to
keep
calm
during
the
meal
from
time
to
time
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
and
was
surprised
at
the
likeness
between
him
and
the
real
it
was
the
same
complexion
the
same
cast
of
features
the
same
cut
of
hair
nevertheless
the
look
of
the
eye
was
different
keener
in
this
case
and
brighter
and
gradually
the
duke
discovered
minor
details
which
had
passed
unperceived
till
then
and
which
proved
the
fellow
imposture
the
party
broke
up
after
dinner
it
was
eight
the
duke
went
to
his
room
and
released
his
nephew
ten
minutes
later
under
cover
of
the
darkness
they
slipped
into
the
ruins
gun
in
hand
meanwhile
angélique
accompanied
by
her
husband
had
gone
to
the
suite
of
rooms
which
she
occupied
on
the
of
a
tower
that
flanked
the
left
wing
her
husband
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
rooms
and
said
i
am
going
for
a
short
stroll
angélique
may
i
come
to
you
here
when
i
return
yes
she
replied
he
left
her
and
went
up
to
the
first
floor
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
as
his
quarters
the
moment
he
was
alone
he
locked
the
door
noiselessly
opened
a
window
that
looked
over
the
landscape
and
leant
out
he
saw
a
shadow
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
some
hundred
feet
or
more
below
him
he
whistled
and
received
a
faint
whistle
in
reply
he
then
took
from
a
cupboard
a
thick
leather
satchel
crammed
with
papers
wrapped
it
in
a
piece
of
black
cloth
and
tied
it
up
then
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
wrote
glad
you
got
my
message
for
i
think
it
unsafe
to
walk
out
of
the
castle
with
that
large
bundle
of
securities
here
they
are
you
will
be
in
paris
on
your
in
time
to
catch
the
morning
train
to
brussels
where
you
will
hand
over
the
bonds
to
and
he
will
negotiate
them
at
once
as
you
pass
by
the
great
oak
tell
our
chaps
that
coming
i
have
some
instructions
to
give
them
but
everything
is
going
well
no
one
here
has
the
least
suspicion
he
fastened
the
letter
to
the
parcel
and
lowered
both
through
the
window
with
a
length
of
string
good
he
said
that
all
right
it
a
weight
off
my
mind
he
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
stalking
up
and
down
the
room
and
smiling
at
the
portraits
of
two
gallant
gentlemen
hanging
on
the
wall
horace
de
marshal
of
france
and
you
the
great
condé
i
salute
you
my
ancestors
both
lupin
de
will
show
himself
worthy
of
you
at
last
when
the
time
came
he
took
his
hat
and
went
down
but
when
he
reached
the
angélique
burst
from
her
rooms
and
exclaimed
with
a
distraught
air
i
say
if
you
do
mind
i
think
you
had
better
and
then
without
saying
more
she
went
in
again
leaving
a
vision
of
irresponsible
terror
in
her
husband
mind
she
out
of
sorts
he
said
to
himself
marriage
does
suit
her
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
out
without
attaching
importance
to
an
incident
that
ought
to
have
impressed
him
poor
angélique
this
will
all
end
in
a
divorce
the
night
outside
was
dark
with
a
cloudy
sky
the
servants
were
closing
the
shutters
of
the
castle
there
was
no
light
in
the
windows
it
being
the
duke
habit
to
go
to
bed
soon
after
dinner
lupin
passed
the
lodge
and
as
he
put
his
foot
on
the
drawbridge
said
leave
the
gate
open
i
am
going
for
a
breath
of
air
i
shall
be
back
soon
the
was
on
the
right
and
ran
along
one
of
the
old
ramparts
which
used
to
surround
the
castle
with
a
second
and
much
larger
enclosure
until
it
ended
at
an
almost
demolished
the
park
which
skirted
a
hillock
and
afterward
followed
the
side
of
a
deep
valley
was
bordered
on
the
left
by
thick
coppices
what
a
wonderful
place
for
an
ambush
he
said
a
regular
spot
he
stopped
thinking
that
he
heard
a
noise
but
no
it
was
a
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
yet
a
stone
went
rattling
down
the
slopes
bounding
against
the
rugged
projections
of
the
rock
but
strange
to
say
nothing
seemed
to
disquiet
him
the
crisp
came
blowing
over
the
plains
of
the
headland
and
he
eagerly
filled
his
lungs
with
it
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
alive
he
thought
still
young
a
member
of
the
old
nobility
a
what
could
a
man
want
more
at
a
short
distance
he
saw
against
the
darkness
the
yet
darker
outline
of
the
chapel
the
ruins
of
which
towered
above
the
path
a
few
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
and
he
heard
a
clock
strike
nine
he
quickened
his
pace
there
was
a
short
descent
then
the
path
rose
again
and
suddenly
he
stopped
once
more
a
hand
had
seized
his
he
drew
back
tried
to
release
himself
but
some
one
stepped
from
the
clump
of
trees
against
which
he
was
brushing
and
a
voice
said
ssh
not
a
word
he
recognized
his
wife
angélique
what
the
matter
he
asked
she
whispered
so
low
that
he
could
hardly
catch
the
words
they
are
lying
in
wait
for
you
they
are
in
there
in
the
ruins
with
their
guns
who
keep
quiet
listen
they
stood
for
a
moment
without
stirring
then
she
said
they
are
not
moving
perhaps
they
never
heard
me
let
go
back
but
come
with
me
her
accent
was
so
imperious
that
he
obeyed
without
further
question
but
suddenly
she
took
fright
run
they
are
coming
i
am
sure
of
it
true
enough
they
heard
a
sound
of
footsteps
then
swiftly
still
holding
him
by
the
hand
she
dragged
him
with
irresistible
energy
along
a
shortcut
following
its
turns
without
hesitation
in
spite
of
the
darkness
and
the
brambles
and
they
very
soon
arrived
at
the
drawbridge
she
put
her
arm
in
his
the
touched
his
cap
they
crossed
the
courtyard
and
entered
the
castle
and
she
led
him
to
the
corner
tower
in
which
both
of
them
had
their
apartments
come
in
here
she
said
to
your
rooms
yes
two
maids
were
sitting
up
for
her
their
mistress
ordered
them
to
retire
to
their
bedrooms
on
the
third
floor
almost
immediately
after
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
outer
room
and
a
voice
called
angélique
is
that
you
father
she
asked
suppressing
her
agitation
yes
is
your
husband
here
we
have
just
come
in
tell
him
i
want
to
speak
to
him
ask
him
to
come
to
my
room
important
very
well
father
i
send
him
to
you
she
listened
for
a
few
seconds
then
returned
to
the
boudoir
where
her
husband
was
and
said
i
am
sure
my
father
is
still
there
he
moved
as
though
to
go
out
in
that
case
if
he
wants
to
speak
to
me
my
father
is
not
alone
she
said
quickly
blocking
his
way
who
is
with
him
his
nephew
jacques
there
was
a
moment
silence
he
looked
at
her
with
a
certain
astonishment
failing
quite
to
understand
his
wife
attitude
but
without
pausing
to
go
into
the
matter
ah
so
that
dear
old
is
there
he
chuckled
then
the
in
the
fire
unless
indeed
my
father
knows
everything
she
said
i
overheard
a
conversation
between
them
just
now
his
nephew
has
read
certain
letters
i
hesitated
at
first
about
telling
you
then
i
thought
that
my
duty
he
studied
her
afresh
but
at
once
conquered
by
the
queerness
of
the
situation
he
burst
out
laughing
what
do
my
friends
on
board
ship
burn
my
letters
and
they
have
let
their
prisoner
escape
the
idiots
oh
when
you
do
see
to
everything
yourself
no
matter
its
distinctly
humorous
versus
oh
but
suppose
i
were
no
longer
recognized
suppose
himself
were
to
confuse
me
with
himself
he
turned
to
a
took
a
towel
dipped
it
in
the
basin
and
soaped
it
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
wiped
the
from
his
face
and
altered
the
set
of
his
hair
that
it
he
said
showing
himself
to
angélique
under
the
aspect
in
which
she
had
seen
him
on
the
night
of
the
burglary
in
paris
i
feel
more
comfortable
like
this
for
a
discussion
with
my
where
are
you
going
she
cried
flinging
herself
in
front
of
the
door
why
to
join
the
gentlemen
you
shall
not
pass
why
not
suppose
they
kill
you
kill
me
that
what
they
mean
to
do
to
kill
you
to
hide
your
body
somewhere
who
would
know
of
it
very
well
he
said
from
their
point
of
view
they
are
quite
right
but
if
i
do
go
to
them
they
will
come
here
that
door
wo
stop
them
nor
you
i
thinking
therefore
it
better
to
have
done
with
it
follow
me
commanded
angélique
she
took
up
the
lamp
that
lit
the
room
went
into
her
bedroom
pushed
aside
the
wardrobe
which
slid
easily
on
hidden
castors
pulled
back
an
old
and
said
here
is
a
door
that
has
not
been
used
for
years
my
father
believes
the
key
to
be
lost
i
have
it
here
unlock
the
door
with
it
a
staircase
in
the
wall
will
take
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
tower
you
need
only
draw
the
bolts
of
another
door
and
you
will
be
free
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
suddenly
he
grasped
the
meaning
of
angélique
whole
behaviour
in
front
of
that
sad
plain
but
wonderfully
gentle
face
he
stood
for
a
moment
discountenanced
almost
abashed
he
no
longer
thought
of
laughing
a
feeling
of
respect
mingled
with
remorse
and
kindness
overcame
him
why
are
you
saving
me
he
whispered
you
are
my
husband
he
protested
no
no
i
have
stolen
that
title
the
law
will
never
recognize
my
marriage
my
father
does
not
want
a
scandal
she
said
just
so
he
replied
sharply
just
so
i
foresaw
that
and
that
was
why
i
had
your
cousin
near
at
hand
once
i
disappear
he
becomes
your
husband
he
is
the
man
you
have
married
in
the
eyes
of
men
you
are
the
man
i
have
married
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
the
church
the
church
there
are
means
of
arranging
matters
with
the
church
your
marriage
can
be
annulled
on
what
pretext
that
we
can
admit
he
remained
silent
thinking
over
all
those
points
which
he
had
not
considered
all
those
points
which
were
trivial
and
absurd
for
him
but
which
were
serious
for
her
and
he
repeated
several
times
this
is
terrible
this
is
terrible
i
should
have
anticipated
and
suddenly
seized
with
an
idea
he
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
there
i
have
it
i
hand
in
glove
with
one
of
the
chief
figures
at
the
vatican
the
pope
never
refuses
me
anything
i
shall
obtain
an
audience
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
holy
father
moved
by
my
entreaties
his
plan
was
so
humorous
and
his
delight
so
artless
that
angélique
could
not
help
smiling
and
she
said
i
am
your
wife
in
the
eyes
of
god
she
gave
him
a
look
that
showed
neither
scorn
nor
animosity
nor
even
anger
and
he
realized
that
she
omitted
to
see
in
him
the
outlaw
and
the
and
remembered
only
the
man
who
was
her
husband
and
to
whom
the
priest
had
bound
her
until
the
hour
of
death
he
took
a
step
toward
her
and
observed
her
more
attentively
she
did
not
lower
her
eyes
at
first
but
she
blushed
and
never
had
he
seen
so
pathetic
a
face
marked
with
such
modesty
and
such
dignity
he
said
to
her
as
on
that
first
evening
in
paris
oh
your
eyes
the
calm
and
sadness
of
your
eyes
the
beauty
of
your
eyes
she
dropped
her
head
and
stammered
go
away
go
in
the
presence
of
her
confusion
he
received
a
quick
intuition
of
the
deeper
feelings
that
stirred
her
unknown
to
herself
to
that
spinster
soul
of
which
he
recognized
the
romantic
power
of
imagination
the
unsatisfied
yearnings
the
poring
over
books
he
suddenly
represented
in
that
exceptional
moment
and
in
consequence
of
the
unconventional
circumstances
of
their
meetings
somebody
special
a
byronic
hero
a
chivalrous
brigand
of
romance
one
evening
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
he
the
adventurer
already
ennobled
in
song
and
story
and
exalted
by
his
own
audacity
had
come
to
her
and
slipped
the
magic
ring
upon
her
finger
a
mystic
and
passionate
betrothal
as
in
the
days
of
the
and
greatly
moved
and
touched
he
was
on
the
verge
of
giving
way
to
an
enthusiastic
impulse
and
exclaiming
let
us
go
away
together
let
us
fly
you
are
my
bride
my
wife
share
my
dangers
my
sorrows
and
my
joys
it
will
be
a
strange
and
vigorous
a
proud
and
magnificent
life
but
angélique
eyes
were
raised
to
his
again
and
they
were
so
pure
and
so
noble
that
he
blushed
in
his
turn
this
was
not
the
woman
to
whom
such
words
could
be
addressed
he
whispered
forgive
me
i
am
a
contemptible
wretch
i
have
wrecked
your
life
no
she
replied
softly
on
the
contrary
you
have
shown
me
where
my
real
life
lies
he
was
about
to
ask
her
to
explain
but
she
had
opened
the
door
and
was
pointing
the
way
to
him
nothing
more
could
be
spoken
between
them
he
went
out
without
a
word
bowing
very
low
as
he
passed
a
month
later
angélique
de
princesse
de
lawful
wife
of
arsène
lupin
took
the
veil
and
under
the
name
of
sister
buried
herself
within
the
walls
of
the
visitation
convent
on
the
day
of
the
ceremony
the
mother
superior
of
the
convent
received
a
heavy
sealed
envelope
containing
a
letter
with
the
following
words
for
sister
poor
enclosed
with
the
letter
were
five
hundred
of
a
thousand
francs
each
ix
the
invisible
prisoner
one
day
at
about
four
as
evening
was
drawing
in
farmer
goussot
with
his
four
sons
returned
from
a
day
shooting
they
were
stalwart
men
all
five
of
them
long
of
limb
with
faces
tanned
by
sun
and
wind
and
all
five
displayed
planted
on
an
enormous
neck
and
shoulders
the
same
small
head
with
the
low
forehead
thin
lips
beaked
nose
and
hard
and
repellent
cast
of
countenance
they
were
feared
and
disliked
by
all
around
them
they
were
a
crafty
family
and
their
word
was
not
to
be
trusted
on
reaching
the
old
that
surrounds
the
héberville
property
the
farmer
opened
a
narrow
massive
door
putting
the
big
key
back
in
his
pocket
after
his
sons
had
passed
in
and
he
walked
behind
them
along
the
path
that
led
through
the
orchards
here
and
there
stood
great
trees
stripped
by
the
autumn
winds
and
clumps
of
pines
the
last
survivors
of
the
ancient
park
now
covered
by
old
goussot
farm
one
of
the
sons
said
i
hope
mother
has
lit
a
log
or
two
there
smoke
coming
from
the
chimney
said
the
father
the
outhouses
and
the
homestead
showed
at
the
end
of
a
lawn
and
above
them
the
village
church
whose
steeple
seemed
to
prick
the
clouds
that
trailed
along
the
sky
all
the
guns
unloaded
asked
old
goussot
mine
is
said
the
eldest
i
slipped
in
a
bullet
to
blow
a
kestrel
head
off
he
was
the
one
who
was
proudest
of
his
skill
and
he
said
to
his
brothers
look
at
that
bough
at
the
top
of
the
cherry
tree
see
me
snap
it
off
on
the
bough
sat
a
scarecrow
which
had
been
there
since
spring
and
which
protected
the
leafless
branches
with
its
idiot
arms
he
raised
his
gun
and
fired
the
figure
came
tumbling
down
with
large
comic
gestures
and
was
caught
on
a
big
lower
branch
where
it
remained
lying
stiff
on
its
stomach
with
a
great
top
hat
on
its
head
of
rags
and
its
legs
swaying
from
right
to
left
above
some
water
that
flowed
past
the
cherry
tree
through
a
wooden
trough
they
all
laughed
the
father
approved
a
fine
shot
my
lad
besides
the
old
boy
was
beginning
to
annoy
me
i
could
take
my
eyes
from
my
plate
at
meals
without
catching
sight
of
that
oaf
they
went
a
few
steps
farther
they
were
not
more
than
thirty
yards
from
the
house
when
the
father
stopped
suddenly
and
said
hullo
what
up
the
sons
also
had
stopped
and
stood
listening
one
of
them
said
under
his
breath
it
comes
from
the
house
from
the
and
another
spluttered
sounds
like
moans
and
mother
alone
suddenly
a
frightful
scream
rang
out
all
five
rushed
forward
another
scream
followed
by
cries
of
despair
we
here
we
coming
shouted
the
eldest
who
was
leading
and
as
it
was
a
roundabout
way
to
the
door
he
smashed
in
a
window
with
his
fist
and
sprang
into
the
old
people
bedroom
the
room
next
to
it
was
the
in
which
mother
goussot
spent
most
of
her
time
damnation
he
said
seeing
her
lying
on
the
floor
with
blood
all
over
her
face
dad
dad
what
where
is
she
roared
old
goussot
appearing
on
the
scene
good
lord
what
this
what
have
they
done
to
your
mother
she
pulled
herself
together
and
with
outstretched
arm
stammered
run
after
him
this
way
this
way
i
all
right
only
a
scratch
or
two
but
run
you
he
taken
the
money
the
father
and
sons
gave
a
bound
he
taken
the
money
bellowed
old
goussot
rushing
to
the
door
to
which
his
wife
was
pointing
he
taken
the
money
stop
thief
but
a
sound
of
several
voices
rose
at
the
end
of
the
passage
through
which
the
other
three
sons
were
coming
i
saw
him
i
saw
him
so
did
i
he
ran
up
the
stairs
no
there
he
is
he
coming
down
again
a
mad
steeplechase
shook
every
floor
in
the
house
farmer
goussot
on
reaching
the
end
of
the
passage
caught
sight
of
a
man
standing
by
the
front
door
trying
to
open
it
if
he
succeeded
it
meant
safety
escape
through
the
market
square
and
the
back
lanes
of
the
village
interrupted
as
he
was
fumbling
at
the
bolts
the
man
turning
stupid
lost
his
head
charged
at
old
goussot
and
sent
him
spinning
dodged
the
eldest
brother
and
pursued
by
the
four
sons
doubled
back
down
the
long
passage
ran
into
the
old
couple
bedroom
flung
his
legs
through
the
broken
window
and
disappeared
the
sons
rushed
after
him
across
the
lawns
and
orchards
now
darkened
by
the
falling
night
the
villain
done
for
chuckled
old
goussot
there
no
way
out
for
him
the
walls
are
too
high
he
done
for
the
scoundrel
the
two
returned
at
that
moment
from
the
village
and
he
told
them
what
had
happened
and
gave
each
of
them
a
gun
if
the
swine
shows
his
nose
anywhere
near
the
house
he
said
let
fly
at
him
give
him
no
mercy
he
told
them
where
to
stand
went
to
make
sure
that
the
which
were
only
used
for
the
carts
were
locked
and
not
till
then
remembered
that
his
wife
might
perhaps
be
in
need
of
aid
well
mother
how
goes
it
where
is
he
have
you
got
him
she
asked
in
a
breath
yes
we
after
him
the
lads
must
have
collared
him
by
now
the
news
quite
restored
her
and
a
nip
of
rum
gave
her
the
strength
to
drag
herself
to
the
bed
with
old
goussot
assistance
and
to
tell
her
story
for
that
matter
there
was
not
much
to
tell
she
had
just
lit
the
fire
in
the
and
she
was
knitting
quietly
at
her
bedroom
window
waiting
for
the
men
to
return
when
she
thought
that
she
heard
a
slight
grating
sound
in
the
next
door
i
must
have
left
the
cat
in
there
she
thought
to
herself
she
went
in
suspecting
nothing
and
was
astonished
to
see
the
two
doors
of
one
of
the
the
one
in
which
they
hid
their
money
wide
open
she
walked
up
to
it
still
without
suspicion
there
was
a
man
there
hiding
with
his
back
to
the
shelves
but
how
did
he
get
in
asked
old
goussot
through
the
passage
i
suppose
we
never
keep
the
back
door
shut
and
then
did
he
go
for
you
no
i
went
for
him
he
tried
to
get
away
you
should
have
let
him
and
what
about
the
money
had
he
taken
it
by
then
had
he
taken
it
i
saw
the
bundle
of
in
his
hands
the
sweep
i
would
have
let
him
kill
me
sooner
oh
we
had
a
sharp
tussle
i
give
you
my
word
then
he
had
no
weapon
no
more
than
i
did
we
had
our
fingers
our
nails
and
our
teeth
look
here
where
he
bit
me
and
i
yelled
and
screamed
only
i
an
old
woman
you
see
i
had
to
let
go
of
him
do
you
know
the
man
i
pretty
sure
it
was
old
trainard
the
tramp
why
of
course
it
old
trainard
cried
the
farmer
i
thought
i
knew
him
too
besides
he
been
hanging
round
the
house
these
last
three
days
the
old
vagabond
must
have
smelt
the
money
aha
trainard
my
man
we
shall
see
some
fun
a
hiding
in
the
first
place
and
then
the
police
i
say
mother
you
can
get
up
now
ca
you
then
go
and
fetch
the
neighbours
ask
them
to
run
for
the
gendarmes
by
the
by
the
attorney
youngster
has
a
bicycle
how
that
damned
old
trainard
scooted
he
got
good
legs
for
his
age
he
has
he
can
run
like
a
hare
goussot
was
holding
his
sides
revelling
in
the
occurrence
he
risked
nothing
by
waiting
no
power
on
earth
could
help
the
tramp
escape
or
keep
him
from
the
sound
thrashing
which
he
had
earned
and
from
being
conveyed
under
safe
escort
to
the
town
gaol
the
farmer
took
a
gun
and
went
out
to
his
two
labourers
anything
fresh
no
farmer
goussot
not
yet
we
have
long
to
wait
unless
old
nick
carries
him
over
the
walls
from
time
to
time
they
heard
the
four
brothers
hailing
one
another
in
the
distance
the
old
bird
was
evidently
making
a
fight
for
it
was
more
active
than
they
would
have
thought
still
with
sturdy
fellows
like
the
goussot
brothers
however
one
of
them
returned
looking
rather
crestfallen
and
made
no
secret
of
his
opinion
it
no
use
keeping
on
at
it
for
the
present
it
pitch
dark
the
old
chap
must
have
crept
into
some
hole
we
hunt
him
out
why
lad
you
off
your
chump
protested
the
farmer
the
eldest
son
now
appeared
quite
out
of
breath
and
was
of
the
same
opinion
as
his
brother
why
not
wait
till
next
day
seeing
that
the
ruffian
was
as
safe
within
the
demesne
as
between
the
walls
of
a
prison
well
i
go
myself
cried
old
goussot
light
me
a
lantern
somebody
but
at
that
moment
three
gendarmes
arrived
and
a
number
of
village
lads
also
came
up
to
hear
the
latest
the
sergeant
of
gendarmes
was
a
man
of
method
he
first
insisted
on
hearing
the
whole
story
in
full
detail
then
he
stopped
to
think
then
he
questioned
the
four
brothers
separately
and
took
his
time
for
reflection
after
each
deposition
when
he
had
learnt
from
them
that
the
tramp
had
fled
toward
the
back
of
the
estate
that
he
had
been
lost
sight
of
repeatedly
and
that
he
had
finally
disappeared
near
a
place
known
as
the
crows
knoll
he
meditated
once
more
and
announced
his
conclusion
better
wait
old
trainard
might
slip
through
our
hands
amidst
all
the
confusion
of
a
pursuit
in
the
dark
and
then
everybody
the
farmer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
cursing
under
his
breath
yielded
to
the
sergeant
arguments
that
worthy
organized
a
strict
watch
distributed
the
brothers
goussot
and
the
lads
from
the
village
under
his
men
eyes
made
sure
that
the
ladders
were
locked
away
and
established
his
headquarters
in
the
where
he
and
farmer
goussot
sat
and
nodded
over
a
decanter
of
old
brandy
the
night
passed
quietly
every
two
hours
the
sergeant
went
his
rounds
and
inspected
the
posts
there
were
no
alarms
old
trainard
did
not
budge
from
his
hole
the
battle
began
at
break
of
day
it
lasted
four
hours
in
those
four
hours
the
thirteen
acres
of
land
within
the
walls
were
searched
explored
gone
over
in
every
direction
by
a
score
of
men
who
beat
the
bushes
with
sticks
trampled
over
the
tall
grass
rummaged
in
the
hollows
of
the
trees
and
scattered
the
heaps
of
dry
leaves
and
old
trainard
remained
invisible
well
this
is
a
bit
thick
growled
goussot
beats
me
altogether
retorted
the
sergeant
and
indeed
there
was
no
explaining
the
phenomenon
for
after
all
apart
from
a
few
old
clumps
of
laurels
and
which
were
thoroughly
beaten
all
the
trees
were
bare
there
was
no
building
no
shed
no
stack
nothing
in
short
that
could
serve
as
a
as
for
the
wall
a
careful
inspection
convinced
even
the
sergeant
that
it
was
physically
impossible
to
scale
it
in
the
afternoon
the
investigations
were
begun
all
over
again
in
the
presence
of
the
and
the
deputy
the
results
were
no
more
successful
nay
worse
the
officials
looked
upon
the
matter
as
so
suspicious
that
they
could
not
restrain
their
and
asked
are
you
quite
sure
farmer
goussot
that
you
and
your
sons
have
been
seeing
double
and
what
about
my
wife
retorted
the
farmer
red
with
anger
did
she
see
double
when
the
scamp
had
her
by
the
throat
go
and
look
at
the
marks
if
you
doubt
me
very
well
but
then
where
is
the
scamp
here
between
those
four
walls
very
well
then
ferret
him
out
we
give
it
up
it
quite
clear
that
if
a
man
were
hidden
within
the
precincts
of
this
farm
we
should
have
found
him
by
now
i
swear
i
lay
hands
on
him
true
as
i
stand
here
shouted
farmer
goussot
it
shall
not
be
said
that
i
been
robbed
of
six
thousand
francs
yes
six
thousand
there
were
three
cows
i
sold
and
then
the
and
then
the
apples
six
notes
which
i
was
just
going
to
take
to
the
bank
well
i
swear
to
heaven
that
the
as
good
as
in
my
pocket
that
all
right
and
i
wish
you
luck
said
the
as
he
went
away
followed
by
the
deputy
and
the
gendarmes
the
neighbours
also
walked
off
in
a
more
or
less
facetious
mood
and
by
the
end
of
the
afternoon
none
remained
but
the
goussots
and
the
two
old
goussot
at
once
explained
his
plan
by
day
they
were
to
search
at
night
they
were
to
keep
an
incessant
watch
it
would
last
as
long
as
it
had
to
hang
it
old
trainard
was
a
man
like
other
men
and
men
have
to
eat
and
drink
old
trainard
must
needs
therefore
come
out
of
his
earth
to
eat
and
drink
at
most
said
goussot
he
can
have
a
few
crusts
of
bread
in
his
pocket
or
even
pull
up
a
root
or
two
at
night
but
as
far
as
concerned
no
go
there
only
the
spring
and
he
be
a
clever
dog
if
he
gets
near
that
he
himself
that
evening
took
up
his
stand
near
the
spring
three
hours
later
his
eldest
son
relieved
him
the
other
brothers
and
the
slept
in
the
house
each
taking
his
turn
of
the
watch
and
keeping
all
the
lamps
and
candles
lit
so
that
there
might
be
no
surprise
so
it
went
on
for
fourteen
consecutive
nights
and
for
fourteen
days
while
two
of
the
men
and
mother
goussot
remained
on
guard
the
five
others
explored
the
héberville
ground
at
the
end
of
that
fortnight
not
a
sign
the
farmer
never
ceased
storming
he
sent
for
a
retired
who
lived
in
the
neighbouring
town
the
inspector
stayed
with
him
for
a
whole
week
he
found
neither
old
trainard
nor
the
least
clue
that
could
give
them
any
hope
of
finding
old
trainard
it
a
bit
thick
repeated
farmer
goussot
for
he
there
the
rascal
as
far
as
being
anywhere
goes
he
there
so
planting
himself
on
the
threshold
he
railed
at
the
enemy
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
blithering
idiot
would
you
rather
croak
in
your
hole
than
fork
out
the
money
then
croak
you
pig
and
mother
goussot
in
her
turn
yelped
in
her
shrill
voice
is
it
prison
you
afraid
of
hand
over
the
notes
and
you
can
hook
it
but
old
trainard
did
not
breathe
a
word
and
the
husband
and
wife
tired
their
lungs
in
vain
shocking
days
passed
farmer
goussot
could
no
longer
sleep
lay
shivering
with
fever
the
sons
became
morose
and
quarrelsome
and
never
let
their
guns
out
of
their
hands
having
no
other
idea
but
to
shoot
the
tramp
it
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
in
the
village
and
the
goussot
story
from
being
local
at
first
soon
went
the
round
of
the
press
came
from
the
from
paris
itself
and
were
rudely
shown
the
door
by
farmer
goussot
each
man
his
own
house
he
said
you
mind
your
business
i
mind
mine
it
nothing
to
do
with
any
one
still
farmer
goussot
go
to
blazes
and
he
slammed
the
door
in
their
face
old
trainard
had
now
been
hidden
within
the
walls
of
héberville
for
something
like
four
weeks
the
goussots
continued
their
search
as
doggedly
and
confidently
as
ever
but
with
daily
decreasing
hope
as
though
they
were
confronted
with
one
of
those
mysterious
obstacles
which
discourage
human
effort
and
the
idea
that
they
would
never
see
their
money
again
began
to
take
root
in
them
one
fine
morning
at
about
ten
a
crossing
the
village
square
at
full
speed
broke
down
and
came
to
a
dead
stop
the
driver
after
a
careful
inspection
declared
that
the
repairs
would
take
some
little
time
whereupon
the
owner
of
the
car
resolved
to
wait
at
the
inn
and
lunch
he
was
a
gentleman
on
the
right
side
of
forty
with
and
a
pleasant
expression
of
face
and
he
soon
made
himself
at
home
with
the
people
at
the
inn
of
course
they
told
him
the
story
of
the
goussots
he
had
not
heard
it
before
as
he
had
been
abroad
but
it
seemed
to
interest
him
greatly
he
made
them
give
him
all
the
details
raised
objections
discussed
various
theories
with
a
number
of
people
who
were
eating
at
the
same
table
and
ended
by
exclaiming
nonsense
it
ca
be
so
intricate
as
all
that
i
have
had
some
experience
of
this
sort
of
thing
and
if
i
were
on
the
premises
that
easily
arranged
said
the
i
know
farmer
goussot
he
wo
object
the
request
was
soon
made
and
granted
old
goussot
was
in
one
of
those
frames
of
mind
when
we
are
less
disposed
to
protest
against
outside
interference
his
wife
at
any
rate
was
very
firm
let
the
gentleman
come
if
he
wants
to
the
gentleman
paid
his
bill
and
instructed
his
driver
to
try
the
car
on
the
as
soon
as
the
repairs
were
finished
i
shall
want
an
hour
he
said
no
more
be
ready
in
an
hour
time
then
he
went
to
farmer
goussot
he
did
not
say
much
at
the
farm
old
goussot
hoping
against
hope
was
lavish
with
information
took
his
visitor
along
the
walls
down
to
the
little
door
opening
on
the
fields
produced
the
key
and
gave
minute
details
of
all
the
searches
that
had
been
made
so
far
oddly
enough
the
stranger
who
hardly
spoke
seemed
not
to
listen
either
he
merely
looked
with
a
rather
vacant
gaze
when
they
had
been
round
the
estate
old
goussot
asked
anxiously
well
well
what
do
you
think
you
know
the
visitor
stood
for
a
moment
without
answering
then
he
said
no
nothing
why
of
course
not
cried
the
farmer
throwing
up
his
arms
how
should
you
know
it
all
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
well
that
old
trainard
has
been
so
jolly
clever
that
he
lying
dead
in
his
hole
and
the
are
rotting
with
him
do
you
hear
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
the
gentleman
said
very
calmly
there
only
one
thing
that
interests
me
the
tramp
all
said
and
done
was
free
at
night
and
able
to
feed
on
what
he
could
pick
up
but
how
about
drinking
out
of
the
question
shouted
the
farmer
quite
out
of
the
question
there
no
water
except
this
and
we
have
kept
watch
beside
it
every
night
it
a
spring
where
does
it
rise
here
where
we
stand
is
there
enough
pressure
to
bring
it
into
the
pool
of
itself
yes
and
where
does
the
water
go
when
it
runs
out
of
the
pool
into
this
pipe
here
which
goes
under
ground
and
carries
it
to
the
house
for
use
in
the
kitchen
so
there
no
way
of
drinking
seeing
that
we
were
there
and
that
the
spring
is
twenty
yards
from
the
house
has
it
rained
during
the
last
four
weeks
not
once
i
told
you
that
already
the
stranger
went
to
the
spring
and
examined
it
the
trough
was
formed
of
a
few
boards
of
wood
joined
together
just
above
the
ground
and
the
water
ran
through
it
slow
and
clear
the
water
not
more
than
a
foot
deep
is
it
he
asked
in
order
to
measure
it
he
picked
up
from
the
grass
a
straw
which
he
dipped
into
the
pool
but
as
he
was
stooping
he
suddenly
broke
off
and
looked
around
him
oh
how
funny
he
said
bursting
into
a
peal
of
laughter
why
what
the
matter
spluttered
old
goussot
rushing
toward
the
pool
as
though
a
man
could
have
lain
hidden
between
those
narrow
boards
and
mother
goussot
clasped
her
hands
what
is
it
have
you
seen
him
where
is
he
neither
in
it
nor
under
it
replied
the
stranger
who
was
still
laughing
he
made
for
the
house
eagerly
followed
by
the
farmer
the
old
woman
and
the
four
sons
the
was
there
also
as
were
the
people
from
the
inn
who
had
been
watching
the
stranger
movements
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
while
they
waited
for
the
extraordinary
disclosure
it
as
i
thought
he
said
with
an
amused
expression
the
old
chap
had
to
quench
his
thirst
somewhere
and
as
there
was
only
the
spring
oh
but
look
here
growled
farmer
goussot
we
should
have
seen
him
it
was
at
night
we
should
have
heard
him
and
seen
him
too
as
we
were
close
by
so
was
he
and
he
drank
the
water
from
the
pool
yes
how
from
a
little
way
off
with
what
with
this
and
the
stranger
showed
the
straw
which
he
had
picked
up
there
here
the
straw
for
the
customer
long
drink
you
will
see
there
more
of
it
than
usual
in
fact
it
is
made
of
three
straws
stuck
into
one
another
that
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
those
three
straws
fastened
together
the
proof
is
conclusive
but
hang
it
all
the
proof
of
what
cried
farmer
goussot
irritably
the
stranger
took
a
shotgun
from
the
rack
is
it
loaded
he
asked
yes
said
the
youngest
of
the
brothers
i
use
it
to
kill
the
sparrows
with
for
fun
it
small
shot
capital
a
peppering
where
it
wo
hurt
him
will
do
the
trick
his
face
suddenly
assumed
a
masterful
look
he
gripped
the
farmer
by
the
arm
and
rapped
out
in
an
imperious
tone
listen
to
me
farmer
goussot
i
not
here
to
do
policeman
work
and
i
wo
have
the
poor
beggar
locked
up
at
any
price
four
weeks
of
starvation
and
fright
is
good
enough
for
anybody
so
you
got
to
swear
to
me
you
and
your
sons
that
you
let
him
off
without
hurting
him
he
must
hand
over
the
money
well
of
course
do
you
swear
i
swear
the
gentleman
walked
back
to
the
at
the
entrance
to
the
orchard
he
took
a
quick
aim
pointing
his
gun
a
little
in
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
cherry
tree
which
overhung
the
spring
he
fired
a
hoarse
cry
rang
from
the
tree
and
the
scarecrow
which
had
been
straddling
the
main
branch
for
a
month
past
came
tumbling
to
the
ground
only
to
jump
up
at
once
and
make
off
as
fast
as
its
legs
could
carry
it
there
was
a
moment
amazement
followed
by
outcries
the
sons
darted
in
pursuit
and
were
not
long
in
coming
up
with
the
runaway
hampered
as
he
was
by
his
rags
and
weakened
by
privation
but
the
stranger
was
already
protecting
him
against
their
wrath
hands
off
there
this
man
belongs
to
me
i
wo
have
him
touched
i
hope
i
have
stung
you
up
too
much
trainard
standing
on
his
straw
legs
wrapped
round
with
strips
of
tattered
cloth
with
his
arms
and
his
whole
body
clad
in
the
same
materials
his
head
swathed
in
linen
tightly
packed
like
a
sausage
the
old
chap
still
had
the
stiff
appearance
of
a
and
the
whole
effect
was
so
ludicrous
and
so
unexpected
that
the
onlookers
screamed
with
laughter
the
stranger
unbound
his
head
and
they
saw
a
veiled
mask
of
tangled
grey
beard
encroaching
on
every
side
upon
a
skeleton
face
lit
up
by
two
eyes
burning
with
fever
the
laughter
was
louder
than
ever
the
money
the
six
notes
roared
the
farmer
the
stranger
kept
him
at
a
distance
one
moment
we
give
you
that
back
we
trainard
and
taking
his
knife
and
cutting
away
the
straw
and
cloth
he
jested
cheerily
you
poor
old
beggar
what
a
guy
you
look
but
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
pull
off
that
trick
you
must
be
confoundedly
clever
or
else
you
had
the
devil
own
luck
so
on
the
first
night
you
used
the
they
left
you
to
rig
yourself
in
these
togs
not
a
bad
idea
who
could
ever
suspect
a
scarecrow
they
were
so
accustomed
to
seeing
it
stuck
up
in
its
tree
but
poor
old
daddy
how
uncomfortable
you
must
have
felt
lying
flat
up
there
on
your
stomach
with
your
arms
and
legs
dangling
down
all
day
long
like
that
the
deuce
of
an
attitude
and
how
you
must
have
been
put
to
it
when
you
ventured
to
move
a
limb
eh
and
how
you
must
have
funked
going
to
sleep
and
then
you
had
to
eat
and
drink
and
you
heard
the
sentry
and
felt
the
barrel
of
his
gun
within
a
yard
of
your
nose
brrrr
but
the
trickiest
of
all
you
know
was
your
bit
of
straw
upon
my
word
when
i
think
that
without
a
sound
without
a
movement
so
to
speak
you
had
to
fish
out
lengths
of
straw
from
your
toggery
fix
them
end
to
end
let
your
apparatus
down
to
the
water
and
suck
up
the
heavenly
moisture
drop
by
drop
upon
my
word
one
could
scream
with
admiration
well
done
trainard
and
he
added
between
his
teeth
only
you
in
a
very
unappetizing
state
my
man
have
you
washed
yourself
all
this
month
you
old
pig
after
all
you
had
as
much
water
as
you
wanted
here
you
people
i
hand
him
over
to
you
i
going
to
wash
my
hands
that
what
i
going
to
do
farmer
goussot
and
his
four
sons
grabbed
at
the
prey
which
he
was
abandoning
to
them
now
then
come
along
fork
out
the
money
dazed
as
he
was
the
tramp
still
managed
to
simulate
astonishment
do
put
on
that
idiot
look
growled
the
farmer
come
on
out
with
the
six
notes
what
what
do
you
want
of
me
stammered
old
trainard
the
money
on
the
nail
what
money
the
the
oh
i
getting
sick
of
you
here
lads
they
laid
the
old
fellow
flat
tore
off
the
rags
that
composed
his
clothes
felt
and
searched
him
all
over
there
was
nothing
on
him
you
thief
and
you
robber
yelled
old
goussot
what
have
you
done
with
it
the
old
beggar
seemed
more
dazed
than
ever
too
cunning
to
confess
he
kept
on
whining
what
do
you
want
of
me
money
i
have
three
sous
to
call
my
own
but
his
eyes
wide
with
wonder
remained
fixed
upon
his
clothes
and
he
himself
seemed
not
to
understand
the
goussots
rage
could
no
longer
be
restrained
they
rained
blows
upon
him
which
did
not
improve
matters
but
the
farmer
was
convinced
that
trainard
had
hidden
the
money
before
turning
himself
into
the
scarecrow
where
have
you
put
it
you
scum
out
with
it
in
what
part
of
the
orchard
have
you
hidden
it
the
money
repeated
the
tramp
with
a
stupid
look
yes
the
money
the
money
which
you
buried
somewhere
oh
if
we
do
find
it
your
goose
is
cooked
we
have
witnesses
we
all
of
you
friends
eh
and
then
the
gentleman
he
turned
with
the
intention
of
addressing
the
stranger
in
the
direction
of
the
spring
which
was
thirty
or
forty
steps
to
the
left
and
he
was
quite
surprised
not
to
see
him
washing
his
hands
there
has
he
gone
he
asked
some
one
answered
no
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
for
a
stroll
in
the
orchard
oh
that
all
right
said
the
farmer
he
the
sort
to
find
the
notes
for
us
just
as
he
found
the
man
unless
said
a
voice
unless
what
echoed
the
farmer
what
do
you
mean
have
you
something
in
your
head
out
with
it
then
what
is
it
but
he
interrupted
himself
suddenly
seized
with
a
doubt
and
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
same
idea
dawned
on
all
the
the
stranger
arrival
at
héberville
the
breakdown
of
his
motor
his
manner
of
questioning
the
people
at
the
inn
and
of
gaining
admission
to
the
farm
were
not
all
these
part
and
parcel
of
a
job
the
trick
of
a
cracksman
who
had
learnt
the
story
from
the
papers
and
who
had
come
to
try
his
luck
on
the
spot
jolly
smart
of
him
said
the
he
must
have
taken
the
money
from
old
trainard
pocket
before
our
eyes
while
he
was
searching
him
impossible
spluttered
farmer
goussot
he
would
have
been
seen
going
out
that
way
by
the
house
whereas
he
strolling
in
the
orchard
mother
goussot
all
of
a
heap
suggested
the
little
door
at
the
end
down
there
the
key
never
leaves
me
but
you
showed
it
to
him
yes
and
i
took
it
back
again
look
here
it
is
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
pocket
and
uttered
a
cry
oh
dash
it
all
it
gone
he
sneaked
it
he
at
once
rushed
away
followed
and
escorted
by
his
sons
and
a
number
of
the
villagers
when
they
were
halfway
down
the
orchard
they
heard
the
throb
of
a
obviously
the
one
belonging
to
the
stranger
who
had
given
orders
to
his
chauffeur
to
wait
for
him
at
that
lower
entrance
when
the
goussots
reached
the
door
they
saw
scrawled
with
a
brick
on
the
panel
the
two
words
arsène
lupin
stick
to
it
as
the
angry
goussots
might
they
found
it
impossible
to
prove
that
old
trainard
had
stolen
any
money
twenty
persons
had
to
bear
witness
that
when
all
was
said
nothing
was
discovered
on
his
person
he
escaped
with
a
few
months
imprisonment
for
the
assault
he
did
not
regret
them
as
soon
as
he
was
released
he
was
secretly
informed
that
every
quarter
on
a
given
date
at
a
given
hour
under
a
given
milestone
on
a
given
road
he
would
find
three
gold
louis
to
a
man
like
old
trainard
that
means
wealth
x
edith
arsène
lupin
what
your
real
opinion
of
inspector
ganimard
a
very
high
one
my
dear
fellow
a
very
high
one
then
why
do
you
never
miss
a
chance
of
turning
him
into
ridicule
it
a
bad
habit
and
i
sorry
for
it
but
what
can
i
say
it
the
way
of
the
world
here
a
decent
here
a
whole
pack
of
decent
men
who
stand
for
law
and
order
who
protect
us
against
the
apaches
who
risk
their
lives
for
honest
people
like
you
and
me
and
we
have
nothing
to
give
them
in
return
but
flouts
and
gibes
preposterous
bravo
lupin
you
talking
like
a
respectable
ratepayer
what
else
am
i
i
may
have
peculiar
views
about
other
property
but
i
assure
you
that
it
very
different
when
my
own
at
stake
by
jove
it
does
do
to
lay
hands
on
what
belongs
to
me
then
i
out
for
blood
aha
it
pocket
money
watch
hands
off
i
have
the
soul
of
a
conservative
my
dear
fellow
the
instincts
of
a
retired
tradesman
and
a
due
respect
for
every
sort
of
tradition
and
authority
and
that
is
why
ganimard
inspires
me
with
no
little
gratitude
and
esteem
but
not
much
admiration
plenty
of
admiration
too
over
and
above
the
dauntless
courage
which
comes
natural
to
all
those
gentry
at
the
criminal
investigation
department
ganimard
possesses
very
sterling
qualities
decision
insight
and
judgment
i
have
watched
him
at
work
he
somebody
when
all
said
do
you
know
the
edith
story
as
it
was
called
i
know
as
much
as
everybody
knows
that
means
that
you
do
know
it
at
all
well
that
job
was
i
daresay
the
one
which
i
thought
out
most
cleverly
with
the
utmost
care
and
the
utmost
precaution
the
one
which
i
shrouded
in
the
greatest
darkness
and
mystery
the
one
which
it
took
the
biggest
generalship
to
carry
through
it
was
a
regular
game
of
chess
played
according
to
strict
scientific
and
mathematical
rules
and
yet
ganimard
ended
by
unravelling
the
knot
thanks
to
him
they
know
the
truth
on
the
quai
des
orfèvres
and
it
is
a
truth
quite
out
of
the
common
i
assure
you
may
i
hope
to
hear
it
certainly
one
of
these
days
when
i
have
time
but
the
brunelli
is
dancing
at
the
opera
and
if
she
were
not
to
see
me
in
my
stall
i
do
not
meet
lupin
often
he
confesses
with
difficulty
when
it
suits
him
it
was
only
gradually
by
snatches
by
odds
and
ends
of
confidences
that
i
was
able
to
obtain
the
different
incidents
and
to
piece
the
story
together
in
all
its
details
the
main
features
are
well
known
and
i
will
merely
mention
the
facts
three
years
ago
when
the
train
from
brest
arrived
at
rennes
the
door
of
one
of
the
luggage
vans
was
found
smashed
in
this
van
had
been
booked
by
colonel
sparmiento
a
rich
brazilian
who
was
travelling
with
his
wife
in
the
same
train
it
contained
a
complete
set
of
the
case
in
which
one
of
these
was
packed
had
been
broken
open
and
the
tapestry
had
disappeared
colonel
sparmiento
started
proceedings
against
the
claiming
heavy
damages
not
only
for
the
stolen
tapestry
but
also
for
the
loss
in
value
which
the
whole
collection
suffered
in
consequence
of
the
theft
the
police
instituted
inquiries
the
company
offered
a
large
reward
a
fortnight
later
a
letter
which
had
come
undone
in
the
post
was
opened
by
the
authorities
and
revealed
the
fact
that
the
theft
had
been
carried
out
under
the
direction
of
arsène
lupin
and
that
a
package
was
to
leave
next
day
for
the
united
states
that
same
evening
the
tapestry
was
discovered
in
a
trunk
deposited
in
the
at
the
gare
the
scheme
therefore
had
miscarried
lupin
felt
the
disappointment
so
much
that
he
vented
his
in
a
communication
to
colonel
sparmiento
ending
with
the
following
words
which
were
clear
enough
for
anybody
it
was
very
considerate
of
me
to
take
only
one
next
time
i
shall
take
the
twelve
colonel
sparmiento
had
been
living
for
some
months
in
a
house
standing
at
the
end
of
a
small
garden
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
faisanderie
and
the
rue
dufresnoy
he
was
a
rather
man
with
black
hair
and
a
swarthy
skin
always
well
and
quietly
dressed
he
was
married
to
an
extremely
pretty
but
delicate
englishwoman
who
was
much
upset
by
the
business
of
the
tapestries
from
the
first
she
implored
her
husband
to
sell
them
for
what
they
would
fetch
the
colonel
had
much
too
forcible
and
dogged
a
nature
to
yield
to
what
he
had
every
right
to
describe
as
a
woman
fancies
he
sold
nothing
but
he
redoubled
his
precautions
and
adopted
every
measure
that
was
likely
to
make
an
attempt
at
burglary
impossible
to
begin
with
so
that
he
might
confine
his
watch
to
the
he
walled
up
all
the
windows
on
the
and
the
first
floor
overlooking
the
rue
dufresnoy
next
he
enlisted
the
services
of
a
firm
which
made
a
speciality
of
protecting
private
houses
against
robberies
every
window
of
the
gallery
in
which
the
tapestries
were
hung
was
fitted
with
invisible
burglar
alarms
the
position
of
which
was
known
to
none
but
himself
these
at
the
least
touch
switched
on
all
the
electric
lights
and
set
a
whole
system
of
bells
and
gongs
ringing
in
addition
to
this
the
insurance
companies
to
which
he
applied
refused
to
grant
policies
to
any
considerable
amount
unless
he
consented
to
let
three
men
supplied
by
the
companies
and
paid
by
himself
occupy
the
of
his
house
every
night
they
selected
for
the
purpose
three
tried
and
trustworthy
men
all
of
whom
hated
lupin
like
poison
as
for
the
servants
the
colonel
had
known
them
for
years
and
was
ready
to
vouch
for
them
after
taking
these
steps
and
organizing
the
defence
of
the
house
as
though
it
were
a
fortress
the
colonel
gave
a
great
a
sort
of
private
view
to
which
he
invited
the
members
of
both
his
clubs
as
well
as
a
certain
number
of
ladies
journalists
and
critics
they
felt
as
they
passed
through
the
much
as
if
they
were
walking
into
a
prison
the
three
private
detectives
posted
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
asked
for
each
visitor
invitation
card
and
eyed
him
up
and
down
suspiciously
making
him
feel
as
though
they
were
going
to
search
his
pockets
or
take
his
the
colonel
who
received
his
guests
on
the
first
floor
made
laughing
apologies
and
seemed
delighted
at
the
opportunity
of
explaining
the
arrangements
which
he
had
invented
to
secure
the
safety
of
his
hangings
his
wife
stood
by
him
looking
charmingly
young
and
pretty
pale
and
sinuous
with
a
sad
and
gentle
expression
the
expression
of
resignation
often
worn
by
those
who
are
threatened
by
fate
when
all
the
guests
had
come
the
and
the
were
closed
then
everybody
filed
into
the
middle
gallery
which
was
reached
through
two
steel
doors
while
its
windows
with
their
huge
shutters
were
protected
by
iron
bars
this
was
where
the
twelve
tapestries
were
kept
they
were
matchless
works
of
art
and
taking
their
inspiration
from
the
famous
bayeux
tapestry
attributed
to
queen
matilda
they
represented
the
story
of
the
norman
conquest
they
had
been
ordered
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
the
descendant
of
a
in
william
the
conqueror
train
were
executed
by
jehan
gosset
a
famous
arras
weaver
and
were
discovered
five
hundred
years
later
in
an
old
breton
on
hearing
of
this
the
colonel
had
struck
a
bargain
for
fifty
thousand
francs
they
were
worth
ten
times
the
money
but
the
finest
of
the
twelve
hangings
composing
the
set
the
most
uncommon
because
the
subject
had
not
been
treated
by
queen
matilda
was
the
one
which
arsène
lupin
had
stolen
and
which
had
been
so
fortunately
recovered
it
portrayed
edith
on
the
battlefield
of
hastings
seeking
among
the
dead
for
the
body
of
her
sweetheart
harold
last
of
the
saxon
kings
the
guests
were
lost
in
enthusiasm
over
this
tapestry
over
the
unsophisticated
beauty
of
the
design
over
the
faded
colours
over
the
grouping
of
the
figures
and
the
pitiful
sadness
of
the
scene
poor
edith
stood
drooping
like
an
overweighted
lily
her
white
gown
revealed
the
lines
of
her
languid
figure
her
long
tapering
hands
were
outstretched
in
a
gesture
of
terror
and
entreaty
and
nothing
could
be
more
mournful
than
her
profile
over
which
flickered
the
most
dejected
and
despairing
of
smiles
a
harrowing
smile
remarked
one
of
the
critics
to
whom
the
others
listened
with
deference
a
very
charming
smile
besides
and
it
reminds
me
colonel
of
the
smile
of
mme
sparmiento
and
seeing
that
the
observation
seemed
to
meet
with
approval
he
enlarged
upon
his
idea
there
are
other
points
of
resemblance
that
struck
me
at
once
such
as
the
very
graceful
curve
of
the
neck
and
the
delicacy
of
the
hands
and
also
something
about
the
figure
about
the
general
attitude
what
you
say
is
so
true
said
the
colonel
that
i
confess
that
it
was
this
likeness
that
decided
me
to
buy
the
hangings
and
there
was
another
reason
which
was
that
by
a
really
curious
chance
my
wife
name
happens
to
be
edith
i
have
called
her
edith
ever
since
and
the
colonel
added
with
a
laugh
i
hope
that
the
coincidence
will
stop
at
this
and
that
my
dear
edith
will
never
have
to
go
in
search
of
her
body
like
her
prototype
he
laughed
as
he
uttered
these
words
but
his
laugh
met
with
no
echo
and
we
find
the
same
impression
of
awkward
silence
in
all
the
accounts
of
the
evening
that
appeared
during
the
next
few
days
the
people
standing
near
him
did
not
know
what
to
say
one
of
them
tried
to
jest
your
name
is
harold
colonel
no
thank
you
he
declared
with
continued
merriment
no
that
not
my
name
nor
am
i
in
the
least
like
the
saxon
king
all
have
since
agreed
in
stating
that
at
that
moment
as
the
colonel
finished
speaking
the
first
alarm
rang
from
the
windows
the
right
or
the
middle
window
opinions
differ
on
this
point
rang
short
and
shrill
on
a
single
note
the
peal
of
the
was
followed
by
an
exclamation
of
terror
uttered
by
mme
sparmiento
who
caught
hold
of
her
husband
arm
he
cried
what
the
matter
what
does
this
mean
the
guests
stood
motionless
with
their
eyes
staring
at
the
windows
the
colonel
repeated
what
does
it
mean
i
do
understand
no
one
but
myself
knows
where
that
bell
is
fixed
and
at
that
moment
here
again
the
evidence
is
unanimous
at
that
moment
came
sudden
absolute
darkness
followed
immediately
by
the
maddening
din
of
all
the
bells
and
all
the
gongs
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
house
in
every
room
and
at
every
window
for
a
few
seconds
a
stupid
disorder
an
insane
terror
reigned
the
women
screamed
the
men
banged
with
their
fists
on
the
closed
doors
they
hustled
and
fought
people
fell
to
the
floor
and
were
trampled
under
foot
it
was
like
a
crowd
scared
by
threatening
flames
or
by
a
bursting
shell
and
above
the
uproar
rose
the
voice
shouting
silence
do
move
it
all
right
the
switch
is
over
there
in
the
corner
wait
a
bit
here
he
had
pushed
his
way
through
his
guests
and
reached
a
corner
of
the
gallery
and
all
at
once
the
electric
light
blazed
up
again
while
the
pandemonium
of
bells
stopped
then
in
the
sudden
light
a
strange
sight
met
the
eyes
two
ladies
had
fainted
mme
sparmiento
hanging
to
her
husband
arm
with
her
knees
dragging
on
the
floor
and
livid
in
the
face
appeared
half
dead
the
men
pale
with
their
neckties
awry
looked
as
if
they
had
all
been
in
the
wars
the
tapestries
are
there
cried
some
one
there
was
a
great
surprise
as
though
the
disappearance
of
those
hangings
ought
to
have
been
the
natural
result
and
the
only
plausible
explanation
of
the
incident
but
nothing
had
been
moved
a
few
valuable
pictures
hanging
on
the
walls
were
there
still
and
though
the
same
din
had
reverberated
all
over
the
house
though
all
the
rooms
had
been
thrown
into
darkness
the
detectives
had
seen
no
one
entering
or
trying
to
enter
besides
said
the
colonel
it
only
the
windows
of
the
gallery
that
have
alarms
nobody
but
myself
understands
how
they
work
and
i
had
not
set
them
yet
people
laughed
loudly
at
the
way
in
which
they
had
been
frightened
but
they
laughed
without
conviction
and
in
a
more
or
less
shamefaced
fashion
for
each
of
them
was
keenly
alive
to
the
absurdity
of
his
conduct
and
they
had
but
one
thought
to
get
out
of
that
house
where
say
what
you
would
the
atmosphere
was
one
of
agonizing
anxiety
two
journalists
stayed
behind
however
and
the
colonel
joined
them
after
attending
to
edith
and
handing
her
over
to
her
maids
the
three
of
them
together
with
the
detectives
made
a
search
that
did
not
lead
to
the
discovery
of
anything
of
the
least
interest
then
the
colonel
sent
for
some
champagne
and
the
result
was
that
it
was
not
until
a
late
hour
to
be
exact
a
quarter
to
three
in
the
morning
that
the
journalists
took
their
leave
the
colonel
retired
to
his
quarters
and
the
detectives
withdrew
to
the
room
which
had
been
set
aside
for
them
on
the
they
took
the
watch
by
turns
a
watch
consisting
in
the
first
place
in
keeping
awake
and
next
in
looking
round
the
garden
and
visiting
the
gallery
at
intervals
these
orders
were
scrupulously
carried
out
except
between
five
and
seven
in
the
morning
when
sleep
gained
the
mastery
and
the
men
ceased
to
go
their
rounds
but
it
was
broad
daylight
out
of
doors
besides
if
there
had
been
the
least
sound
of
bells
would
they
not
have
woke
up
nevertheless
when
one
of
them
at
twenty
minutes
past
seven
opened
the
door
of
the
gallery
and
flung
back
the
shutters
he
saw
that
the
twelve
tapestries
were
gone
this
man
and
the
others
were
blamed
afterward
for
not
giving
the
alarm
at
once
and
for
starting
their
own
investigations
before
informing
the
colonel
and
telephoning
to
the
local
commissary
yet
this
very
excusable
delay
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
hampered
the
action
of
the
police
in
any
case
the
colonel
was
not
told
until
eight
he
was
dressed
and
ready
to
go
out
the
news
did
not
seem
to
upset
him
beyond
measure
or
at
least
he
managed
to
control
his
emotion
but
the
effort
must
have
been
too
much
for
him
for
he
suddenly
dropped
into
a
chair
and
for
some
moments
gave
way
to
a
regular
fit
of
despair
and
anguish
most
painful
to
behold
in
a
man
of
his
resolute
appearance
recovering
and
mastering
himself
he
went
to
the
gallery
stared
at
the
bare
walls
and
then
sat
down
at
a
table
and
hastily
scribbled
a
letter
which
he
put
into
an
envelope
and
sealed
there
he
said
i
in
a
hurry
i
have
an
important
engagement
here
is
a
letter
for
the
commissary
of
police
and
seeing
the
detectives
eyes
upon
him
he
added
i
am
giving
the
commissary
my
views
telling
him
of
a
suspicion
that
occurs
to
me
he
must
follow
it
up
i
will
do
what
i
can
he
left
the
house
at
a
run
with
excited
gestures
which
the
detectives
were
subsequently
to
remember
a
few
minutes
later
the
commissary
of
police
arrived
he
was
handed
the
letter
which
contained
the
following
words
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
tether
the
theft
of
those
tapestries
completes
the
crash
which
i
have
been
trying
to
conceal
for
the
past
year
i
bought
them
as
a
speculation
and
was
hoping
to
get
a
million
francs
for
them
thanks
to
the
fuss
that
was
made
about
them
as
it
was
an
american
offered
me
six
hundred
thousand
it
meant
my
salvation
this
means
utter
destruction
i
hope
that
my
dear
wife
will
forgive
the
sorrow
which
i
am
bringing
upon
her
her
name
will
be
on
my
lips
at
the
last
moment
mme
sparmiento
was
informed
she
remained
aghast
with
horror
while
inquiries
were
instituted
and
attempts
made
to
trace
the
movements
late
in
the
afternoon
a
came
from
ville
a
gang
of
had
found
a
man
body
lying
at
the
entrance
to
a
tunnel
after
a
train
had
passed
the
body
was
hideously
mutilated
the
face
had
lost
all
resemblance
to
anything
human
there
were
no
papers
in
the
pockets
but
the
description
answered
to
that
of
the
colonel
mme
sparmiento
arrived
at
ville
by
at
seven
in
the
evening
she
was
taken
to
a
room
at
the
when
the
sheet
that
covered
it
was
removed
edith
edith
recognized
her
husband
body
in
these
circumstances
lupin
did
not
receive
his
usual
good
notices
in
the
press
let
him
look
to
himself
jeered
one
summing
up
the
general
opinion
it
would
not
take
many
exploits
of
this
kind
for
him
to
forfeit
the
popularity
which
has
not
been
grudged
him
hitherto
we
have
no
use
for
lupin
except
when
his
rogueries
are
perpetrated
at
the
expense
of
shady
foreign
adventurers
german
barons
banks
and
financial
companies
and
above
all
no
murders
a
burglar
we
can
put
up
with
but
a
murderer
no
if
he
is
not
directly
guilty
he
is
at
least
responsible
for
this
death
there
is
blood
upon
his
hands
the
arms
on
his
escutcheon
are
stained
gules
the
public
anger
and
disgust
were
increased
by
the
pity
which
pale
face
aroused
the
guests
of
the
night
before
gave
their
version
of
what
had
happened
omitting
none
of
the
impressive
details
and
a
legend
formed
straightway
around
the
englishwoman
a
legend
that
assumed
a
really
tragic
character
owing
to
the
popular
story
of
the
heroine
and
yet
the
public
could
not
withhold
its
admiration
of
the
extraordinary
skill
with
which
the
theft
had
been
effected
the
police
explained
it
after
a
fashion
the
detectives
had
noticed
from
the
first
and
subsequently
stated
that
one
of
the
three
windows
of
the
gallery
was
wide
open
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
lupin
and
his
confederates
had
entered
through
this
window
it
seemed
a
very
plausible
suggestion
still
in
that
case
how
were
they
able
first
to
climb
the
garden
railings
in
coming
and
going
without
being
seen
secondly
to
cross
the
garden
and
put
up
a
ladder
on
the
without
leaving
the
least
trace
behind
thirdly
to
open
the
shutters
and
the
window
without
starting
the
bells
and
switching
on
the
lights
in
the
house
the
police
accused
the
three
detectives
of
complicity
the
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
case
examined
them
at
length
made
minute
inquiries
into
their
private
lives
and
stated
formally
that
they
were
above
all
suspicion
as
for
the
tapestries
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
that
they
would
be
recovered
it
was
at
this
moment
that
ganimard
returned
from
india
where
he
had
been
hunting
for
lupin
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
most
convincing
proofs
supplied
by
former
confederates
of
lupin
himself
feeling
that
he
had
once
more
been
tricked
by
his
everlasting
adversary
fully
believing
that
lupin
had
dispatched
him
on
this
chase
so
as
to
be
rid
of
him
during
the
business
of
the
tapestries
he
asked
for
a
fortnight
leave
of
absence
called
on
mme
sparmiento
and
promised
to
avenge
her
husband
edith
had
reached
the
point
at
which
not
even
the
thought
of
vengeance
relieves
the
sufferer
pain
she
had
dismissed
the
three
detectives
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
engaged
just
one
man
and
an
old
to
take
the
place
of
the
large
staff
of
servants
the
sight
of
whom
reminded
her
too
cruelly
of
the
past
not
caring
what
happened
she
kept
her
room
and
left
ganimard
free
to
act
as
he
pleased
he
took
up
his
quarters
on
the
and
at
once
instituted
a
series
of
the
most
minute
investigations
he
started
the
inquiry
afresh
questioned
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
studied
the
distribution
of
the
rooms
and
set
each
of
the
going
thirty
and
forty
times
over
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
asked
for
an
extension
of
leave
the
chief
of
the
who
was
at
that
time
dudouis
came
to
see
him
and
found
him
perched
on
the
top
of
a
ladder
in
the
gallery
that
day
the
admitted
that
all
his
searches
had
proved
useless
two
days
later
however
dudouis
called
again
and
discovered
ganimard
in
a
very
thoughtful
frame
of
mind
a
bundle
of
newspapers
lay
spread
in
front
of
him
at
last
in
reply
to
his
superior
urgent
questions
the
muttered
i
know
nothing
chief
absolutely
nothing
but
there
a
confounded
notion
worrying
me
only
it
seems
so
absurd
and
then
it
explain
things
on
the
contrary
it
confuses
them
rather
then
then
i
implore
you
chief
to
have
a
little
patience
to
let
me
go
my
own
way
but
if
i
telephone
to
you
some
day
or
other
suddenly
you
must
jump
into
a
taxi
without
losing
a
minute
it
will
mean
that
i
have
discovered
the
secret
hours
passed
then
one
morning
dudouis
received
a
telegram
going
to
lille
ganimard
what
the
dickens
can
he
want
to
go
to
lille
for
wondered
the
the
day
passed
without
news
followed
by
another
day
but
dudouis
had
every
confidence
in
ganimard
he
knew
his
man
knew
that
the
old
detective
was
not
one
of
those
people
who
excite
themselves
for
nothing
when
ganimard
got
a
move
on
him
it
meant
that
he
had
sound
reasons
for
doing
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
evening
of
that
second
day
dudouis
was
called
to
the
telephone
is
that
you
chief
is
it
ganimard
speaking
cautious
men
both
they
began
by
making
sure
of
each
other
identity
as
soon
as
his
mind
was
eased
on
this
point
ganimard
continued
hurriedly
ten
men
chief
at
once
and
please
come
yourself
where
are
you
in
the
house
on
the
but
i
will
wait
for
you
just
inside
the
i
come
at
once
in
a
taxi
of
course
yes
chief
stop
the
taxi
fifty
yards
from
the
house
i
let
you
in
when
you
whistle
things
took
place
as
ganimard
had
arranged
shortly
after
midnight
when
all
the
lights
were
out
on
the
upper
floors
he
slipped
into
the
street
and
went
to
meet
dudouis
there
was
a
hurried
consultation
the
officers
distributed
themselves
as
ganimard
ordered
then
the
chief
and
the
walked
back
together
noiselessly
crossed
the
garden
and
closeted
themselves
with
every
precaution
well
what
it
all
about
asked
dudouis
what
does
all
this
mean
upon
my
word
we
look
like
a
pair
of
conspirators
but
ganimard
was
not
laughing
his
chief
had
never
seen
him
in
such
a
state
of
perturbation
nor
heard
him
speak
in
a
voice
denoting
such
excitement
any
news
ganimard
yes
chief
and
this
time
but
i
can
hardly
believe
it
myself
and
yet
i
not
mistaken
i
know
the
real
truth
it
may
be
as
unlikely
as
you
please
but
it
is
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
he
wiped
away
the
drops
of
perspiration
that
trickled
down
his
forehead
and
after
a
further
question
from
dudouis
pulled
himself
together
swallowed
a
glass
of
water
and
began
lupin
has
often
got
the
better
of
me
look
here
ganimard
said
dudouis
interrupting
him
why
ca
you
come
straight
to
the
point
tell
me
in
two
words
what
happened
no
chief
retorted
the
it
is
essential
that
you
should
know
the
different
stages
which
i
have
passed
through
excuse
me
but
i
consider
it
indispensable
and
he
repeated
i
was
saying
chief
that
lupin
has
often
got
the
better
of
me
and
led
me
many
a
dance
but
in
this
contest
in
which
i
have
always
come
out
worst
so
far
i
have
at
least
gained
experience
of
his
manner
of
play
and
learnt
to
know
his
tactics
now
in
the
matter
of
the
tapestries
it
occurred
to
me
almost
from
the
start
to
set
myself
two
problems
in
the
first
place
lupin
who
never
makes
a
move
without
knowing
what
he
is
after
was
obviously
aware
that
colonel
sparmiento
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
money
and
that
the
loss
of
the
tapestries
might
drive
him
to
suicide
nevertheless
lupin
who
hates
the
very
thought
of
bloodshed
stole
the
tapestries
there
was
the
inducement
said
dudouis
of
the
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
francs
which
they
are
worth
no
chief
i
tell
you
once
more
whatever
the
occasion
might
be
lupin
would
not
take
life
nor
be
the
cause
of
another
person
death
for
anything
in
this
world
for
millions
and
millions
that
the
first
point
in
the
second
place
what
was
the
object
of
all
that
disturbance
in
the
evening
during
the
party
obviously
do
you
think
to
surround
the
business
with
an
atmosphere
of
anxiety
and
terror
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
also
to
divert
suspicion
from
the
truth
which
otherwise
might
easily
have
been
suspected
you
seem
not
to
understand
chief
upon
my
word
i
do
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
ganimard
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
particularly
plain
and
i
myself
when
i
put
the
problem
before
my
mind
in
those
same
words
did
not
understand
it
very
clearly
and
yet
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
yes
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
that
lupin
wanted
to
divert
suspicions
to
divert
them
to
himself
lupin
mark
you
so
that
the
real
person
who
was
working
the
business
might
remain
unknown
a
confederate
suggested
dudouis
a
confederate
moving
among
the
visitors
who
set
the
alarms
going
and
who
managed
to
hide
in
the
house
after
the
party
had
broken
up
you
getting
warm
chief
you
getting
warm
it
is
certain
that
the
tapestries
as
they
can
not
have
been
stolen
by
any
one
making
his
way
surreptitiously
into
the
house
were
stolen
by
somebody
who
remained
in
the
house
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
by
taking
the
list
of
the
people
invited
and
inquiring
into
the
antecedents
of
each
of
them
one
might
well
well
chief
there
a
namely
that
the
three
detectives
had
this
list
in
their
hands
when
the
guests
arrived
and
that
they
still
had
it
when
the
guests
left
now
came
in
and
went
away
so
you
see
then
do
you
suppose
a
servant
no
the
detectives
no
but
still
but
still
said
the
chief
impatiently
if
the
robbery
was
committed
from
the
inside
that
is
beyond
dispute
declared
the
inspector
whose
excitement
seemed
to
be
nearing
there
is
no
question
about
it
all
my
investigations
led
to
the
same
certainty
and
my
conviction
gradually
became
so
positive
that
i
ended
one
day
by
drawing
up
this
startling
axiom
in
theory
and
in
fact
the
robbery
can
only
have
been
committed
with
the
assistance
of
an
accomplice
staying
in
the
house
whereas
there
was
no
accomplice
that
absurd
said
dudouis
quite
absurd
said
ganimard
but
at
the
very
moment
when
i
uttered
that
absurd
sentence
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
eh
oh
a
very
dim
very
incomplete
but
still
sufficient
truth
with
that
clue
to
guide
me
i
was
bound
to
find
the
way
do
you
follow
me
chief
dudouis
sat
silent
the
same
phenomenon
that
had
taken
place
in
ganimard
was
evidently
taking
place
in
him
he
muttered
if
it
not
one
of
the
guests
nor
the
servants
nor
the
private
detectives
then
there
no
one
left
yes
chief
there
one
left
dudouis
started
as
though
he
had
received
a
shock
and
in
a
voice
that
betrayed
his
excitement
but
look
here
that
preposterous
why
come
think
for
yourself
go
on
chief
say
what
in
your
mind
nonsense
what
do
you
mean
go
on
chief
it
impossible
how
can
sparmiento
have
been
lupin
accomplice
ganimard
gave
a
little
chuckle
exactly
arsène
lupin
accomplice
that
explains
everything
during
the
night
while
the
three
detectives
were
downstairs
watching
or
sleeping
rather
for
colonel
sparmiento
had
given
them
champagne
to
drink
and
perhaps
doctored
it
beforehand
the
said
colonel
took
down
the
hangings
and
passed
them
out
through
the
window
of
his
bedroom
the
room
is
on
the
second
floor
and
looks
out
on
another
street
which
was
not
watched
because
the
lower
windows
are
walled
up
dudouis
reflected
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
preposterous
he
repeated
why
why
because
if
the
colonel
had
been
arsène
lupin
accomplice
he
would
not
have
committed
suicide
after
achieving
his
success
who
says
that
he
committed
suicide
why
he
was
found
dead
on
the
line
i
told
you
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
with
lupin
still
this
was
genuine
enough
besides
mme
sparmiento
identified
the
body
i
thought
you
would
say
that
chief
the
argument
worried
me
too
there
was
i
all
of
a
sudden
with
three
people
in
front
of
me
instead
of
one
first
arsène
lupin
cracksman
secondly
colonel
sparmiento
his
accomplice
thirdly
a
dead
man
spare
us
it
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
ganimard
took
a
bundle
of
newspapers
untied
it
and
handed
one
of
them
to
dudouis
you
remember
chief
last
time
you
were
here
i
was
looking
through
the
papers
i
wanted
to
see
if
something
had
not
happened
at
that
period
that
might
bear
upon
the
case
and
confirm
my
supposition
please
read
this
paragraph
dudouis
took
the
paper
and
read
aloud
our
lille
correspondent
informs
us
that
a
curious
incident
has
occurred
in
that
town
a
corpse
has
disappeared
from
the
local
morgue
the
corpse
of
a
man
unknown
who
threw
himself
under
the
wheels
of
a
steam
on
the
day
before
no
one
is
able
to
suggest
a
reason
for
this
disappearance
dudouis
sat
thinking
and
then
asked
so
you
believe
i
have
just
come
from
lille
replied
ganimard
and
my
inquiries
leave
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
the
corpse
was
removed
on
the
same
night
on
which
colonel
sparmiento
gave
his
it
was
taken
straight
to
ville
by
and
the
car
remained
near
the
until
the
evening
near
the
tunnel
therefore
said
dudouis
next
to
it
chief
so
that
the
body
which
was
found
is
merely
that
body
dressed
in
colonel
sparmiento
clothes
precisely
chief
then
colonel
sparmiento
is
not
dead
no
more
dead
than
you
or
i
chief
but
then
why
all
these
complications
why
the
theft
of
one
tapestry
followed
by
its
recovery
followed
by
the
theft
of
the
twelve
why
that
why
that
disturbance
why
everything
your
story
hold
water
ganimard
only
because
you
chief
like
myself
have
stopped
halfway
because
strange
as
this
story
already
sounds
we
must
go
still
farther
very
much
farther
in
the
direction
of
the
improbable
and
the
astounding
and
why
not
after
all
remember
that
we
are
dealing
with
arsène
lupin
with
him
is
it
not
always
just
the
improbable
and
the
astounding
that
we
must
look
for
must
we
not
always
go
straight
for
the
maddest
suppositions
and
when
i
say
the
maddest
i
am
using
the
wrong
word
on
the
contrary
the
whole
thing
is
wonderfully
logical
and
so
simple
that
a
child
could
understand
it
confederates
only
betray
you
why
employ
confederates
when
it
is
so
easy
and
so
natural
to
act
for
yourself
by
yourself
with
your
own
hands
and
by
the
means
within
your
own
reach
what
are
you
saying
what
are
you
saying
what
are
you
saying
cried
dudouis
in
a
sort
of
voice
and
a
tone
of
bewilderment
that
increased
with
each
separate
exclamation
ganimard
gave
a
fresh
chuckle
takes
your
breath
away
chief
does
it
so
it
did
mine
on
the
day
when
you
came
to
see
me
here
and
when
the
notion
was
beginning
to
grow
upon
me
i
was
flabbergasted
with
astonishment
and
yet
i
had
experience
of
my
customer
i
know
what
he
capable
of
but
this
no
this
was
really
a
bit
too
stiff
it
impossible
it
impossible
said
dudouis
in
a
low
voice
on
the
contrary
chief
it
quite
possible
and
quite
logical
and
quite
normal
it
the
threefold
incarnation
of
one
and
the
same
individual
a
schoolboy
would
solve
the
problem
in
a
minute
by
a
simple
process
of
elimination
take
away
the
dead
man
there
remains
sparmiento
and
lupin
take
away
sparmiento
there
remains
lupin
muttered
the
yes
chief
lupin
simply
lupin
in
five
letters
and
two
syllables
lupin
taken
out
of
his
brazilian
skin
lupin
revived
from
the
dead
lupin
translated
for
the
past
six
months
into
colonel
sparmiento
travelling
in
brittany
hearing
of
the
discovery
of
the
twelve
tapestries
buying
them
planning
the
theft
of
the
best
of
them
so
as
to
draw
attention
to
himself
lupin
and
divert
it
from
himself
sparmiento
next
he
brings
about
in
full
view
of
the
gaping
public
a
noisy
contest
between
lupin
and
sparmiento
or
sparmiento
and
lupin
plots
and
gives
the
party
terrifies
his
guests
and
when
everything
is
ready
arranges
for
lupin
to
steal
sparmiento
tapestries
and
for
sparmiento
lupin
victim
to
disappear
from
sight
and
die
unsuspected
unsuspectable
regretted
by
his
friends
pitied
by
the
public
and
leaving
behind
him
to
pocket
the
profits
of
the
swindle
ganimard
stopped
looked
the
chief
in
the
eyes
and
in
a
voice
that
emphasized
the
importance
of
his
words
concluded
leaving
behind
him
a
disconsolate
widow
mme
sparmiento
you
really
believe
hang
it
all
said
the
people
do
work
up
a
whole
business
of
this
sort
without
seeing
something
ahead
of
them
solid
profits
but
the
profits
it
seems
to
me
lie
in
the
sale
of
the
tapestries
which
lupin
will
effect
in
america
or
elsewhere
first
of
all
yes
but
colonel
sparmiento
could
effect
that
sale
just
as
well
and
even
better
so
there
something
more
something
more
come
chief
you
forgetting
that
colonel
sparmiento
has
been
the
victim
of
an
important
robbery
and
that
though
he
may
be
dead
at
least
his
widow
remains
so
it
his
widow
who
will
get
the
money
what
money
what
money
why
the
money
due
to
her
the
of
course
dudouis
was
staggered
the
whole
business
suddenly
became
clear
to
him
with
its
real
meaning
he
muttered
that
true
that
true
the
colonel
had
insured
his
tapestries
rather
and
for
no
trifle
either
for
how
much
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
eight
hundred
thousand
just
so
in
five
different
companies
and
has
mme
sparmiento
had
the
money
she
got
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
yesterday
and
two
hundred
thousand
while
i
was
away
the
remaining
payments
are
to
be
made
in
the
course
of
this
week
but
this
is
terrible
you
ought
to
have
what
chief
to
begin
with
they
took
advantage
of
my
absence
to
settle
up
accounts
with
the
companies
i
only
heard
about
it
on
my
return
when
i
ran
up
against
an
whom
i
happen
to
know
and
took
the
opportunity
of
drawing
him
out
the
was
silent
for
some
time
not
knowing
what
to
say
then
he
mumbled
what
a
fellow
though
ganimard
nodded
his
head
yes
chief
a
blackguard
but
i
ca
help
saying
a
devil
of
a
clever
fellow
for
his
plan
to
succeed
he
must
have
managed
in
such
a
way
that
for
four
or
five
weeks
no
one
could
express
or
even
conceive
the
least
suspicion
of
the
part
played
by
colonel
sparmiento
all
the
indignation
and
all
the
inquiries
had
to
be
concentrated
upon
lupin
alone
in
the
last
resort
people
had
to
find
themselves
faced
simply
with
a
mournful
pitiful
penniless
widow
poor
edith
a
beautiful
and
legendary
vision
a
creature
so
pathetic
that
the
gentlemen
of
the
were
almost
glad
to
place
something
in
her
hands
to
relieve
her
poverty
and
her
grief
that
what
was
wanted
and
that
what
happened
the
two
men
were
close
together
and
did
not
take
their
eyes
from
each
other
faces
the
chief
asked
who
is
that
woman
sonia
kritchnoff
sonia
kritchnoff
yes
the
russian
girl
whom
i
arrested
last
year
at
the
time
of
the
theft
of
the
coronet
and
whom
lupin
helped
to
escape
e
e
the
novel
of
the
play
by
edgar
jepson
and
maurice
leblanc
mills
boon
are
you
sure
absolutely
i
was
put
off
the
scent
like
everybody
else
by
machinations
and
had
paid
no
particular
attention
to
her
but
when
i
knew
the
part
which
she
was
playing
i
remembered
she
is
certainly
sonia
metamorphosed
into
an
englishwoman
sonia
the
most
and
the
trickiest
of
actresses
sonia
who
would
not
hesitate
to
face
death
for
love
of
lupin
a
good
capture

with
excitement
what
do
you
mean
ganimard
do
you
think
chief
that
i
would
have
brought
you
here
at
this
late
hour
if
i
had
had
nothing
more
attractive
to
offer
you
than
sonia
and
victoire
pah
they
have
kept
you
mean
to
say
whispered
dudouis
at
last
understanding
the
agitation
you
guessed
it
chief
is
he
here
he
here
in
hiding
not
a
bit
of
it
simply
in
disguise
he
the
this
time
dudouis
did
not
utter
a
word
nor
make
a
gesture
audacity
confounded
him
ganimard
chuckled
it
no
longer
a
threefold
but
a
fourfold
incarnation
edith
might
have
blundered
the
master
presence
was
necessary
and
he
had
the
cheek
to
return
for
three
weeks
he
has
been
beside
me
during
my
inquiry
calmly
following
the
progress
made
did
you
recognize
him
one
does
recognize
him
he
has
a
knack
of
his
face
and
altering
the
proportions
of
his
body
so
as
to
prevent
any
one
from
knowing
him
besides
i
was
miles
from
suspecting
but
this
evening
as
i
was
watching
sonia
in
the
shadow
of
the
stairs
i
heard
victoire
speak
to
the
and
call
him
a
light
flashed
in
upon
me
that
was
what
she
always
used
to
call
him
and
i
knew
where
i
was
dudouis
seemed
flustered
in
his
turn
by
the
presence
of
the
enemy
so
often
pursued
and
always
so
intangible
we
got
him
this
time
he
said
between
his
teeth
we
got
him
and
he
ca
escape
us
no
chief
he
ca
neither
he
nor
the
two
women
where
are
they
sonia
and
victoire
are
on
the
second
floor
lupin
is
on
the
third
dudouis
suddenly
became
anxious
why
it
was
through
the
windows
of
one
of
those
floors
that
the
tapestries
were
passed
when
they
disappeared
that
so
chief
in
that
case
lupin
can
get
away
too
the
windows
look
out
on
the
rue
dufresnoy
of
course
they
do
chief
but
i
have
taken
my
precautions
the
moment
you
arrived
i
sent
four
of
our
men
to
keep
watch
under
the
windows
in
the
rue
dufresnoy
they
have
strict
instructions
to
shoot
if
any
one
appears
at
the
windows
and
looks
like
coming
down
blank
cartridges
for
the
first
shot
for
the
next
good
ganimard
you
have
thought
of
everything
we
wait
here
and
immediately
after
sunrise
wait
chief
stand
on
ceremony
with
that
rascal
bother
about
rules
and
regulations
legal
hours
and
all
that
rot
and
suppose
he
not
quite
so
polite
to
us
and
gives
us
the
slip
meanwhile
suppose
he
plays
us
one
of
his
lupin
tricks
no
no
we
must
have
no
nonsense
we
got
him
collar
him
and
that
without
delay
and
ganimard
all
with
indignant
impatience
went
out
walked
across
the
garden
and
presently
returned
with
men
it
all
right
chief
i
told
them
in
the
rue
dufresnoy
to
get
their
revolvers
out
and
aim
at
the
windows
come
along
these
alarums
and
excursions
had
not
been
effected
without
a
certain
amount
of
noise
which
was
bound
to
be
heard
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
dudouis
felt
that
his
hand
was
forced
he
made
up
his
mind
to
act
come
on
then
he
said
the
thing
did
not
take
long
the
eight
of
them
browning
pistols
in
hand
went
up
the
stairs
without
overmuch
precaution
eager
to
surprise
lupin
before
he
had
time
to
organize
his
defences
open
the
door
roared
ganimard
rushing
at
the
door
of
mme
sparmiento
bedroom
a
policeman
smashed
it
in
with
his
shoulder
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
and
no
one
in
victoire
bedroom
either
they
all
upstairs
shouted
ganimard
they
gone
up
to
lupin
in
his
attic
be
careful
now
all
the
eight
ran
up
the
third
flight
of
stairs
to
his
great
astonishment
ganimard
found
the
door
of
the
attic
open
and
the
attic
empty
and
the
other
rooms
were
empty
too
blast
them
he
cursed
what
become
of
them
but
the
chief
called
him
dudouis
who
had
gone
down
again
to
the
second
floor
noticed
that
one
of
the
windows
was
not
latched
but
just
pushed
to
there
he
said
to
ganimard
that
the
road
they
took
the
road
of
the
tapestries
i
told
you
as
much
the
rue
dufresnoy
but
our
men
would
have
fired
on
them
protested
ganimard
grinding
his
teeth
with
rage
the
street
guarded
they
must
have
gone
before
the
street
was
guarded
they
were
all
three
of
them
in
their
rooms
when
i
rang
you
up
chief
they
must
have
gone
while
you
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
garden
but
why
why
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
go
rather
than
or
the
next
day
or
next
week
for
that
matter
when
they
had
pocketed
all
the
yes
there
was
a
reason
and
ganimard
knew
it
when
he
saw
on
the
table
a
letter
addressed
to
himself
and
opened
it
and
read
it
the
letter
was
worded
in
the
style
of
the
testimonials
which
we
hand
to
people
in
our
service
who
have
given
satisfaction
i
the
undersigned
arsène
lupin
hereby
certify
that
the
person
of
the
name
of
ganimard
gave
proof
of
the
most
remarkable
qualities
during
his
stay
in
this
house
he
was
exemplary
in
his
behaviour
thoroughly
devoted
and
attentive
and
unaided
by
the
least
clue
he
foiled
a
part
of
my
plans
and
saved
the
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
i
congratulate
him
and
i
am
quite
willing
to
overlook
his
blunder
in
not
anticipating
that
the
downstairs
telephone
communicates
with
the
telephone
in
sonia
kritchnoff
bedroom
and
that
when
telephoning
to
he
was
at
the
same
time
telephoning
to
me
to
clear
out
as
fast
as
i
could
it
was
a
pardonable
slip
which
must
not
be
allowed
to
dim
the
glamour
of
his
services
nor
to
detract
from
the
merits
of
his
victory
having
said
this
i
beg
him
to
accept
the
homage
of
my
admiration
and
of
my
sincere
friendship
