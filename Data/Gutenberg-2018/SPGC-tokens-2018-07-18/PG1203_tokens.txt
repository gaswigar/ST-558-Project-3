s
ingratitude
for
you
miss
dolly
foster
exclaimed
suddenly
where
i
asked
rousing
myself
from
meditation
she
pointed
to
a
young
man
who
had
just
passed
where
we
sat
he
was
dressed
very
smartly
and
was
walking
with
a
lady
attired
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
i
made
that
man
said
dolly
and
now
he
cuts
me
dead
before
the
whole
of
the
row
it
s
atrocious
why
but
for
me
do
you
suppose
he
d
be
at
this
moment
engaged
to
three
thousand
a
year
and
and
the
plainest
girl
in
london
not
that
i
pleaded
think
of
well
very
plain
anyhow
i
was
quite
ready
to
bow
to
him
i
almost
in
fact
you
did
i
didn
t
i
declare
i
didn
oh
well
you
didn
t
then
it
only
looked
like
i
met
him
said
miss
dolly
three
years
ago
at
that
time
he
was
oh
quite
unpresentable
he
was
everything
he
shouldn
t
be
he
was
a
teetotaler
you
know
and
he
didn
t
smoke
and
he
was
always
going
to
concerts
oh
and
he
wore
his
hair
long
and
his
trousers
short
and
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
umbrella
where
did
he
wear
that
he
carried
that
carter
don
t
be
silly
carried
it
unrolled
you
know
and
generally
a
paper
parcel
in
the
other
hand
and
he
had
spectacles
he
has
certainly
changed
outwardly
at
least
yes
i
know
well
i
did
that
i
took
him
in
hand
and
i
just
taught
him
and
now
yes
i
know
that
but
how
did
you
teach
him
give
him
saturday
evening
lectures
or
what
oh
lectures
and
walks
and
i
taught
him
to
dance
and
broke
his
wretched
fiddle
with
my
own
hands
what
very
arbitrary
distinctions
you
draw
i
don
t
know
that
you
mean
i
do
like
a
man
to
be
smart
anyhow
don
t
you
carter
you
re
not
so
smart
as
you
might
be
now
shall
i
take
you
in
hand
and
she
smiled
upon
me
let
s
hear
your
method
what
did
you
do
to
him
to
phil
meadows
oh
nothing
i
just
slipped
in
a
remark
here
and
there
whenever
he
talked
nonsense
i
used
to
speak
just
at
the
right
time
you
but
how
had
your
words
such
influence
miss
foster
oh
well
you
know
carter
i
made
it
a
condition
that
he
should
do
just
what
i
wanted
in
little
things
like
that
did
he
think
i
was
going
to
walk
about
with
a
man
carrying
a
brown
paper
parcel
as
if
we
had
been
to
the
shop
for
a
pound
of
tea
still
i
don
t
see
why
he
should
alter
all
his
oh
you
are
stupid
of
course
he
liked
me
you
oh
did
he
i
you
seem
to
think
that
very
not
that
he
did
but
that
apparently
he
doesn
well
you
got
out
of
that
rather
neatly
for
you
no
he
doesn
t
now
you
see
he
misunderstood
my
motive
he
thought
well
i
do
believe
he
thought
i
cared
for
him
you
know
of
course
i
didn
not
a
bit
just
as
a
friend
and
a
pupil
you
know
and
when
he
d
had
his
hair
cut
and
bought
a
frock
coat
fancy
he
d
never
had
one
he
looked
quite
nice
he
has
nice
eyes
did
you
notice
lord
no
well
you
re
so
oh
not
always
i
ve
observed
that
your
please
don
t
it
s
no
use
is
it
i
looked
very
unhappy
there
is
an
understanding
that
i
am
very
unhappy
since
miss
foster
s
engagement
to
the
earl
of
mickleham
was
announced
what
was
i
saying
before
before
you
you
know
oh
about
phil
meadows
of
course
i
did
like
him
very
much
you
know
or
i
shouldn
t
have
taken
all
that
trouble
why
his
own
mother
thanked
me
i
have
no
more
to
say
said
i
but
she
wrote
me
a
horrid
letter
you
re
so
very
so
very
what
carter
you
leave
so
much
out
i
mean
after
what
why
after
i
sent
him
away
didn
t
i
tell
you
oh
we
had
the
most
awful
scene
he
raved
carter
he
called
me
the
most
horrid
names
and
tore
his
hair
it
wasn
t
long
enough
to
get
hold
of
she
tittered
but
don
t
laugh
it
was
really
dreadful
and
so
unjust
and
then
next
day
when
i
thought
it
was
comfortably
over
you
know
he
came
back
and
and
apologized
and
called
himself
the
most
awful
names
and
well
that
was
really
what
did
the
fellow
complain
of
i
asked
in
wondering
tones
oh
he
said
i
d
destroyed
his
faith
in
women
you
know
and
that
i
d
led
him
on
and
that
i
was
well
he
was
very
rude
indeed
and
he
went
on
writing
me
letters
like
that
for
a
whole
year
it
made
me
quite
but
he
didn
t
go
back
to
short
trousers
and
a
fiddle
did
he
i
asked
anxiously
oh
no
but
he
forgot
all
he
owed
me
and
he
told
me
that
his
heart
was
dead
and
that
he
should
never
love
any
one
but
he
s
going
to
marry
that
oh
he
doesn
t
care
about
her
said
miss
dolly
reassuringly
it
s
the
money
you
know
he
hadn
t
a
farthing
of
his
own
now
he
ll
be
set
up
for
and
it
s
all
due
to
you
said
i
admiringly
well
it
is
i
don
t
call
her
such
a
girl
i
hadn
t
seen
her
face
mr
carter
she
s
hideous
i
dropped
that
subject
and
now
said
miss
dolly
again
he
cuts
me
dead
it
is
the
height
of
ingratitude
why
to
love
you
was
a
liberal
education
yes
wasn
t
it
how
nicely
you
put
that
a
liberal
education
i
shall
tell
archie
is
lord
mickleham
what
about
phil
meadows
goodness
me
no
carter
just
what
you
said
you
but
why
not
tell
mickleham
about
phil
meadows
i
urged
it
s
all
to
your
credit
you
i
know
but
men
are
so
foolish
you
see
archie
thinks
of
course
he
you
might
let
me
archie
thinks
you
were
never
in
love
yes
he
does
well
of
course
i
wasn
t
in
love
with
phil
not
a
little
bit
oh
well
nor
with
any
one
else
miss
dolly
looked
for
an
instant
in
my
direction
nor
with
any
one
else
said
i
miss
dolly
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
nor
with
i
began
hullo
old
chappie
where
did
you
spring
from
why
archie
cried
miss
dolly
oh
how
are
you
mickleham
old
man
take
this
seat
i
m
just
off
just
off
yes
i
was
upon
my
honor
got
to
meet
a
man
at
the
club
goodbye
miss
foster
jove
i
m
late
and
as
i
went
i
heard
miss
dolly
say
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
archie
dear
well
she
didn
t
think
he
was
coming
just
then
no
more
did
cordial
relations
the
other
day
i
paid
a
call
on
miss
dolly
foster
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
to
her
my
small
offering
on
the
occasion
of
her
marriage
to
lord
mickleham
it
was
a
pretty
little
bit
of
jewelry
a
pearl
heart
broken
rubies
played
the
part
of
blood
and
held
together
by
a
gold
pin
set
with
diamonds
the
whole
surmounted
by
an
earl
s
coronet
i
had
taken
some
trouble
about
it
and
was
grateful
when
miss
dolly
asked
me
to
explain
the
symbolism
it
is
my
heart
i
observed
the
fracture
is
your
making
the
pin
here
miss
dolly
interrupted
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
not
sorry
for
i
was
fairly
graveled
for
the
meaning
of
the
pin
what
nonsense
carter
she
said
but
it
s
awfully
pretty
thanks
so
very
very
much
aren
t
relations
funny
people
if
you
wish
to
change
the
subject
pray
do
said
i
i
ll
change
anything
except
my
look
here
she
pursued
holding
out
a
bundle
of
letters
here
are
the
congratulatory
epistles
from
relations
shall
i
read
you
a
few
it
will
be
a
most
agreeable
mode
of
passing
the
time
said
i
this
is
from
aunt
georgiana
she
s
a
widow
lives
at
cheltenham
my
dearest
dorothea
who
dorothea
s
my
name
carter
it
means
the
gift
of
heaven

my
dearest
dorothea
i
have
heard
the
news
of
your
engagement
to
lord
mickleham
with
deep
thankfulness
to
obtain
the
love
of
an
honest
man
is
a
great
prize
i
hope
you
will
prove
worthy
of
it
marriage
is
a
trial
and
an
opportunity
hear
hear
said
i
a
trial
for
the
husband
and
be
quiet
carter
a
trial
and
an
opportunity
it
searches
the
heart
and
affords
a
sphere
of
usefulness
which
so
she
goes
on
you
know
i
don
t
see
why
i
need
be
lectured
just
because
i
m
going
to
be
married
do
you
carter
let
s
try
another
said
i
who
s
that
on
pink
paper
oh
that
s
georgy
vane
she
s
awful
fun
dear
old
dolly
so
you
ve
brought
it
off
hearty
congrats
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
silly
and
throw
away
there
s
nothing
else
there
carter
look
here
listen
to
this
it
s
from
uncle
william
he
s
a
clergyman
you
know
my
dear
niece
i
have
heard
with
great
gratification
of
your
engagement
your
aunt
and
i
unite
in
all
good
wishes
i
recollect
lord
mickleham
s
father
when
i
had
a
curacy
near
worcester
he
was
a
regular
attendant
at
church
and
a
supporter
of
all
good
works
in
the
diocese
if
only
his
son
takes
after
him
fancy
archie
you
have
secured
a
prize
i
hope
you
have
a
proper
sense
of
the
responsibilities
you
are
undertaking
marriage
affords
no
small
opportunities
it
also
entails
certain
trials
why
you
re
reading
aunt
georgiana
am
i
no
it
s
uncle
then
let
s
try
a
fresh
cast
unless
you
ll
finish
georgy
vane
well
here
s
cousin
susan
s
she
s
an
old
maid
you
know
it
s
very
long
here
s
a
bit
woman
has
it
in
her
power
to
exercise
a
sacred
influence
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
lord
mickleham
but
i
hope
my
dear
that
you
will
use
your
power
over
him
for
good
it
is
useless
for
me
to
deny
that
when
you
stayed
with
me
i
thought
you
were
addicted
to
frivolity
doubtless
marriage
will
sober
you
try
to
make
a
good
use
of
its
lessons
i
am
sending
you
a
biscuit
tin
and
so
a
very
proper
letter
said
i
miss
dolly
indulged
in
a
slight
grimace
and
took
up
another
letter
this
she
said
is
from
my
algernon
a
daughter
of
lord
doldrums
wasn
t
she
yes
my
dear
dorothea
i
have
heard
your
news
i
do
hope
it
will
turn
out
happily
i
believe
that
any
woman
who
conscientiously
does
her
duty
can
find
happiness
in
married
life
her
husband
and
children
occupy
all
her
time
and
all
her
thoughts
and
if
she
can
look
for
few
of
the
lighter
pleasures
of
life
she
has
at
least
the
knowledge
that
she
is
of
use
in
the
world
please
accept
the
accompanying
volumes
it
s
browning
as
a
small
i
say
carter
do
you
think
it
s
really
like
that
there
is
still
time
to
draw
back
i
observed
oh
don
t
be
silly
here
this
is
my
brother
tom
s
dear
dol
i
thought
mickleham
rather
an
ass
when
i
met
him
but
i
dare
say
you
know
best
what
s
his
place
like
does
he
take
a
moor
i
thought
i
read
that
he
kept
a
yacht
does
he
give
him
my
love
and
a
kiss
good
luck
old
girl
tom
i
m
glad
it
s
not
me
you
a
disgusting
letter
i
observed
not
at
all
said
miss
dolly
dimpling
it
s
just
like
dear
old
tom
listen
to
grandpapa
s
my
dear
granddaughter
the
alliance
i
rather
like
it
s
being
called
an
alliance
carter
it
sounds
like
the
royal
family
doesn
t
it
you
are
about
to
contract
is
in
all
respects
a
suitable
one
i
send
you
my
blessing
and
a
small
check
to
help
towards
your
yours
affectionately
jno
wm
that
said
i
is
the
best
up
to
yes
it
s
said
she
smiling
here
s
old
lady
whose
i
exclaimed
archie
s
mother
s
you
know
my
dear
dorothea
as
i
suppose
i
must
call
you
now
archibald
has
informed
us
of
his
engagement
and
i
and
the
girls
there
are
five
girls
carter
hasten
to
welcome
his
bride
i
am
sure
archie
will
make
his
wife
very
happy
he
is
rather
particular
like
his
dear
father
but
he
has
a
good
heart
and
is
not
fidgety
about
his
meals
of
course
we
shall
be
delighted
to
move
out
of
the
towers
at
once
i
hope
we
shall
see
a
great
deal
of
you
soon
archie
is
full
of
your
praises
and
we
thoroughly
trust
his
taste
archie
it
s
all
about
archie
you
naturally
said
i
well
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
i
count
a
little
too
oh
look
here
here
s
cousin
fred
s
but
he
s
always
so
silly
i
shan
t
read
you
o
just
a
bit
of
it
i
pleaded
well
here
s
one
bit
i
suppose
i
can
t
murder
him
so
i
must
wish
him
joy
all
i
can
say
is
dolly
that
he
s
the
luckiest
something
i
can
t
read
either
fellow
or
devil
i
ever
heard
of
i
wonder
if
you
ve
forgotten
that
evening
well
go
for
she
stopped
oh
there
s
nothing
in
fact
you
have
forgotten
the
evening
entirely
said
miss
dolly
tossing
her
head
but
he
sends
me
a
love
of
a
bracelet
he
can
t
possibly
pay
for
it
poor
young
knave
said
i
severely
i
had
paid
for
my
pearl
heart
then
comes
a
lot
from
girls
oh
there
s
one
from
maud
tottenham
she
s
a
second
cousin
you
know
it
s
rather
amusing
i
used
to
know
your
fiance
slightly
he
seemed
very
nice
but
it
s
a
long
while
ago
and
i
never
saw
much
of
him
i
hope
he
is
really
fond
of
you
and
that
it
is
not
a
mere
fancy
since
you
love
him
so
much
it
would
be
a
pity
if
he
did
not
care
deeply
for
interpret
miss
dolly
said
i
she
tried
to
catch
him
herself
said
miss
dolly
ah

the
others
aren
t
very
then
let
s
finish
georgy
vane
really
she
asked
smiling
yes
oh
if
you
don
t
mind
i
don
t
said
she
laughing
and
she
hunted
out
the
pink
note
and
spread
it
before
her
let
me
see
where
was
i
oh
here
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
silly
and
throw
away
your
chances
on
some
of
the
men
who
used
to
flirt
with
you
archie
mickleham
may
not
be
a
genius
but
he
s
a
good
fellow
and
a
swell
and
rich
and
he
s
not
a
pauper
like
phil
meadows
or
a
snob
like
charlie
dawson
or
shall
i
go
on
carter
no
i
won
t
i
didn
t
see
what
it
yes
you
shall
go
o
no
i
can
t
and
she
folded
up
the
letter
then
i
will
and
i
m
ashamed
to
say
i
snatched
the
letter
miss
dolly
jumped
to
her
feet
i
fled
behind
the
table
she
ran
round
i
dodged
or
i
began
to
read
stop
cried
she
or
a
young
spendthrift
like
that
man
i
forget
his
name
who
you
used
to
go
on
with
at
such
a
pace
at
monte
carlo
last
stop
she
cried
you
must
stop
so
then
i
stopped
i
folded
the
letter
and
handed
it
back
to
her
her
cheeks
flushed
red
as
she
took
it
i
thought
you
were
a
gentleman
said
she
biting
her
lip
i
was
at
monte
carlo
last
winter
myself
said
i
lord
mickleham
said
the
butler
throwing
open
the
door
retribution
in
future
i
am
going
to
be
careful
what
i
do
i
am
also
and
this
is
by
no
means
less
important
going
to
be
very
careful
what
miss
dolly
foster
does
everybody
knows
if
i
may
quote
her
particular
friend
nellie
phaeton
that
dear
dolly
means
no
harm
but
she
is
just
a
little
i
thanked
miss
phaeton
for
the
expression
the
fact
is
that
old
lady
here
i
quote
miss
dolly
sent
for
me
the
other
day
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
the
countess
and
i
went
in
some
trepidation
when
i
was
ushered
in
lady
mickleham
put
up
her
you
know
those
abominations
with
long
torture
i
mean
tortoise
shell
handles
er
carter
said
she
i
bowed
i
would
have
denied
it
if
i
could
my
dears
said
lady
mickleham
upon
this
five
young
ladies
who
had
been
sitting
in
five
chairs
doing
five
pieces
of
embroidery
rose
bowed
and
filed
out
of
the
room
i
felt
very
nervous
a
pause
followed
then
the
countess
observed
and
it
seemed
at
first
rather
irrelevant
i
ve
been
reading
an
unpleasant
in
these
days
of
french
influence
i
began
apologetically
not
that
i
write
such
stories
or
any
stories
but
lady
mickleham
invites
an
apologetic
attitude
and
my
eye
wandered
to
the
table
i
saw
nothing
worse
or
better
than
the
morning
paper
there
contained
in
a
friend
s
letter
she
continued
focusing
the
starers
full
on
my
face
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
so
i
bowed
again
it
must
have
been
as
painful
for
her
to
write
as
for
me
to
read
lady
mickleham
went
on
and
that
is
saying
much
be
seated
i
bowed
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
i
also
began
in
my
fright
to
play
with
one
of
the
pieces
of
embroidery
is
lady
jane
s
work
in
your
way
lady
jane
is
named
after
jane
the
famous
countess
to
caroline
of
anspach
i
dropped
the
embroidery
and
put
my
foot
on
my
hat
i
believe
carter
that
you
are
acquainted
with
miss
dorothea
foster
i
have
that
pleasure
said
i
who
is
about
to
be
married
to
my
son
the
earl
of
mickleham
that
i
believe
is
so
said
i
was
beginning
to
pull
myself
together
my
son
carter
is
of
a
simple
and
trusting
disposition
perhaps
i
had
better
come
to
the
point
i
am
informed
by
this
letter
that
in
conversation
with
the
writer
the
other
day
archibald
mentioned
quite
incidentally
some
very
startling
facts
those
facts
concern
you
may
i
ask
the
name
of
the
writer
i
do
not
think
that
is
necessary
said
she
she
is
a
lady
in
whom
i
have
the
utmost
that
is
of
course
enough
said
i
it
appears
carter
and
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
speak
plainly
i
set
my
teeth
that
you
have
in
the
first
place
given
to
my
son
s
bride
a
wedding
present
which
i
can
only
describe
as
a
pearl
ornament
i
interposed
with
a
ruby
or
two
and
a
pearl
heart
she
corrected
er
fractured
and
that
you
explained
that
this
absurd
article
represented
your
mere
badinage
said
i
in
execrably
bad
taste
said
she
i
bowed
in
fact
most
offensive
but
that
is
not
the
worst
from
my
son
s
further
statements
it
appears
that
on
one
occasion
at
least
he
found
you
and
miss
foster
engaged
in
what
i
can
only
call
i
raised
my
hand
in
protest
the
countess
took
no
notice
what
i
can
only
call
romping
i
cried
a
thing
not
only
atrociously
vulgar
at
all
times
but
under
the
circumstances
need
i
say
more
carter
you
were
engaged
in
chasing
my
son
s
future
bride
round
a
table
pardon
me
lady
mickleham
your
son
s
future
bride
was
engaged
in
chasing
me
round
a
it
is
the
same
thing
said
lady
mickleham
i
should
have
thought
there
was
a
distinction
said
i
none
at
i
fell
back
on
a
second
line
of
defense
i
didn
t
let
her
catch
me
lady
mickleham
i
pleaded
lady
mickleham
grew
quite
red
this
made
me
feel
more
at
my
ease
no
sir
if
you
had
goodness
knows
i
murmured
shaking
my
head
as
it
happened
however
my
son
entered
in
the
middle
of
this
disgraceful
it
was
at
the
beginning
said
i
with
a
regretful
sigh
upon
this
and
i
have
really
never
been
so
pleased
at
anything
in
all
my
life
the
countess
the
violence
of
her
emotions
penetrating
to
her
very
fingers
gripped
the
handle
of
her
starers
with
such
force
that
she
broke
it
in
two
she
was
a
woman
of
the
world
and
in
a
moment
she
looked
as
if
nothing
had
happened
with
me
it
was
different
and
that
i
am
not
now
on
lady
mickleham
s
visiting
list
is
due
to
inter
alia
et
enormia
the
fact
that
i
laughed
it
was
out
before
i
could
help
it
in
a
second
i
was
as
grave
as
a
mute
the
mischief
was
done
the
countess
rose
i
imitated
her
example
you
are
amused
said
she
and
her
tones
banished
the
last
of
my
mirth
i
stumbled
on
my
hat
and
it
rolled
to
her
feet
it
is
not
probable
she
observed
that
after
miss
foster
s
marriage
you
will
meet
her
often
you
will
move
in
er
somewhat
different
i
may
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
in
her
carriage
from
the
top
of
my
bus
said
i
lady
mickleham
rang
the
bell
i
stooped
for
my
hat
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
rather
afraid
to
expose
myself
in
such
a
defenseless
attitude
but
the
countess
preserved
her
self
control
the
butler
opened
the
door
i
bowed
and
left
the
countess
regarding
me
through
the
maimed
then
i
found
the
butler
smiling
he
probably
knew
the
signs
of
the
weather
i
wouldn
t
be
lady
mickleham
s
butler
if
you
made
me
a
duke
as
i
walked
home
through
the
park
i
met
miss
dolly
and
mickleham
they
stopped
i
walked
on
mickleham
seized
me
by
the
coat
tails
do
you
mean
to
cut
us
he
cried
yes
said
i
why
what
the
deuce
he
began
i
ve
seen
your
mother
said
i
i
wish
mickleham
that
when
you
do
happen
to
intrude
as
you
did
the
other
day
you
wouldn
t
repeat
what
you
lord
he
cried
she
s
not
heard
of
that
i
only
told
aunt
i
said
something
about
aunt
does
does
she
know
it
all
asked
miss
dolly
more
than
all
much
didn
t
you
smooth
it
over
said
miss
dolly
reproachfully
on
reflection
said
i
i
don
t
know
that
i
did
i
hadn
t
you
know
suddenly
mickleham
burst
out
laughing
what
a
game
he
exclaimed
that
s
all
very
well
for
you
said
dolly
but
do
you
happen
to
remember
that
we
dine
there
tonight
archie
grew
grave
i
hope
you
ll
enjoy
yourselves
said
i
i
always
cling
to
the
belief
that
the
wicked
are
and
i
looked
at
miss
dolly
never
you
mind
little
woman
said
archie
drawing
miss
dolly
s
arm
through
his
i
ll
see
you
through
after
all
everybody
knows
that
old
carter
s
an
that
piece
of
universal
knowledge
may
help
matters
but
i
do
not
quite
see
how
i
walked
on
for
miss
dolly
had
quite
forgotten
me
and
was
looking
up
at
archie
mickleham
like
well
hang
it
in
the
way
they
do
you
know
so
i
just
walked
on
i
believe
miss
dolly
has
got
a
husband
who
is
let
us
say
good
enough
for
her
and
for
one
reason
and
another
i
am
glad
of
it
and
i
also
believe
that
she
knows
it
and
i
am
i
suppose
glad
of
that
too
oh
yes
of
course
i
am
of
course
the
perverseness
of
it
i
tell
you
what
carter
said
miss
nellie
phaeton
touching
up
rhino
with
her
whip
love
in
a
cottage
is
lord
forgive
us
cinders
ashes
dust
i
quoted
we
were
spanking
round
the
park
behind
ready
and
rhino
miss
phaeton
s
horses
are
very
large
her
groom
is
very
small
and
her
courage
is
indomitable
i
am
no
great
hand
at
driving
myself
and
i
am
not
always
quite
comfortable
moreover
the
stricter
part
of
my
acquaintance
consider
i
believe
that
miss
phaeton
s
attentions
to
me
are
somewhat
pronounced
and
that
i
ought
not
to
drive
with
her
in
the
park
you
re
right
she
went
on
what
a
girl
wants
is
a
good
house
and
lots
of
cash
and
some
ridin
and
a
little
huntin
and
a
few
g
s
i
cried
in
shuddering
entreaty
if
you
love
me
a
g
or
well
i
suppose
so
said
she
you
can
t
go
ridin
without
gees
can
you
apparently
one
could
go
driving
without
any
but
i
did
not
pursue
the
subject
it
s
only
in
stories
that
people
are
in
love
when
they
marry
observed
miss
phaeton
reflectively
yes
and
then
it
s
generally
with
somebody
else
said
i
oh
if
you
count
that
said
she
hitting
ready
rather
viciously
we
bounded
forward
and
i
heard
the
little
groom
bumping
on
the
back
seat
i
am
always
glad
not
to
be
a
groom
it
s
a
sort
of
life
which
must
be
very
wearying
were
you
ever
in
love
she
asked
just
avoiding
a
brougham
which
contained
the
duchess
of
dexminster
if
by
the
way
i
have
to
run
into
anyone
i
like
it
to
be
a
duchess
you
get
a
much
handsomer
paragraph
yes
said
i
often
oh
not
too
often
and
i
always
take
great
care
you
what
of
that
it
shall
be
quite
out
of
the
question
you
know
it
s
not
at
all
difficult
i
only
have
to
avoid
persons
of
moderate
but
aren
t
you
a
person
of
exactly
that
s
why
so
i
choose
either
a
pauper
when
it
s
impossible
or
an
heiress
when
it
s
preposterous
see
but
don
t
you
ever
want
to
get
began
miss
phaeton
let
s
talk
about
something
else
said
i
i
believe
you
re
humbuggin
me
said
miss
phaeton
i
am
offering
a
veiled
apology
said
i
stuff
said
she
you
know
you
told
dolly
foster
that
i
should
make
an
excellent
wife
for
a
oh
these
women
a
man
had
better
talk
to
a
phonograph
or
anybody
else
said
i
politely
miss
phaeton
whipped
up
her
horses
look
out
there
s
the
mounted
policeman
i
cried
no
he
isn
t
are
you
afraid
she
retorted
i
m
not
fit
to
die
i
pleaded
i
don
t
care
a
pin
for
your
opinion
you
know
she
continued
i
had
never
supposed
that
she
did
but
what
did
you
mean
by
it
i
never
said
oh
all
right
i
never
then
dolly
invented
it
of
course
said
i
steadily
on
your
honor
oh
come
miss
phaeton
would
would
other
people
think
so
she
asked
with
a
highly
surprising
touch
of
timidity
nobody
would
i
said
only
a
snarling
old
wretch
would
say
so
just
because
he
thought
it
there
was
a
long
pause
then
miss
phaeton
asked
me
abruptly
you
never
met
him
did
you
a
pause
ensued
we
passed
the
duchess
again
and
scratched
the
nose
of
her
poodle
which
was
looking
out
of
the
carriage
window
miss
phaeton
flicked
rhino
and
the
groom
behind
went
on
the
seat
he
lives
in
town
you
know
remarked
miss
phaeton
they
mostly
do
and
write
about
the
country
said
i
why
shouldn
t
they
she
asked
fiercely
my
dear
miss
phaeton
by
all
means
let
them
said
i
he
s
awfully
clever
you
know
she
continued
but
he
wouldn
t
always
talk
sometimes
he
just
sat
and
said
nothin
or
read
a
a
sudden
intuition
discovered
gay
s
feelings
to
me
you
were
talking
about
the
run
or
something
i
suppose
yes
or
the
bag
you
as
she
spoke
she
pulled
up
ready
and
rhino
the
little
groom
jumped
down
and
stood
under
not
at
their
heads
i
leant
back
and
surveyed
the
crowd
sitting
and
walking
miss
phaeton
flicked
a
fly
off
rhino
s
ear
put
her
whip
in
the
socket
and
leant
back
also
then
i
suppose
you
didn
t
care
much
about
him
i
asked
oh
i
liked
him
pretty
well
she
answered
very
carelessly
at
this
moment
looking
along
the
walk
i
saw
a
man
coming
toward
us
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
with
just
a
touch
of
softness
in
his
face
he
was
dressed
in
correct
fashion
save
that
his
hair
was
a
trifle
longer
his
coat
a
trifle
fuller
his
hat
a
trifle
larger
his
tie
a
trifle
looser
than
they
were
worn
by
most
he
caught
my
attention
and
i
went
on
looking
at
him
for
a
little
while
till
a
light
movement
of
my
companion
s
made
me
turn
my
head
miss
phaeton
was
sitting
bolt
upright
she
fidgeted
with
the
reins
she
took
her
whip
out
of
the
socket
and
put
it
back
again
and
to
my
amazement
her
cheeks
were
very
red
presently
the
man
came
opposite
the
carriage
miss
phaeton
bowed
he
lifted
his
hat
smiled
and
made
as
if
to
pass
on
miss
phaeton
held
out
her
hand
i
could
see
a
momentary
gleam
of
surprise
in
his
eyes
as
though
he
thought
her
cordiality
more
than
he
might
have
looked
for
possibly
even
more
than
he
cared
about
but
he
stopped
and
shook
hands
how
are
you
mr
gay
she
said
not
introducing
me
still
with
your
inseparables
he
said
gayly
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
towards
the
horses
i
hope
miss
phaeton
that
in
the
next
world
your
faithful
steeds
will
be
allowed
to
bear
you
company
or
what
will
you
do
o
you
think
i
care
for
nothin
but
horses
said
she
petulantly
but
she
leant
towards
him
and
gave
me
her
shoulder
o
no
he
laughed
dogs
also
and
i
m
afraid
one
day
it
was
ferrets
wasn
t
it
have
have
you
written
any
poetry
lately
she
asked
how
conscientious
of
you
to
inquire
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
twinkling
o
yes
a
hundred
things
have
you
killed
anything
lately
i
could
swear
she
flushed
again
her
voice
trembled
as
she
answered
no
not
i
caught
sight
of
his
face
behind
her
back
and
i
thought
i
saw
a
trace
of
puzzle
nothing
more
he
held
out
his
hand
well
so
glad
to
have
seen
you
miss
phaeton
said
he
but
i
must
run
on
goodbye
gay
said
she
and
lifting
his
hat
again
smiling
again
gayly
he
was
gone
for
a
moment
or
two
i
said
nothing
then
i
remarked
so
that
s
your
friend
gay
is
it
he
s
not
a
yes
that
s
him
said
she
and
as
she
spoke
she
sank
back
in
her
seat
for
a
moment
i
did
not
look
at
her
face
then
she
sat
up
straight
again
and
took
the
whip
want
to
stay
any
longer
she
asked
no
said
i
the
little
groom
sprang
away
rhino
and
ready
dashed
ahead
shall
i
drop
you
at
the
club
she
asked
i
m
goin
i
ll
get
out
here
said
i
we
came
to
a
stand
again
and
i
got
down
goodbye
i
said
she
nodded
at
me
but
said
nothing
a
second
later
the
carriage
was
tearing
down
the
road
and
the
little
groom
hanging
on
for
dear
life
of
course
it
s
all
nonsense
she
s
not
the
least
suited
to
him
she
d
make
him
miserable
and
then
be
miserable
herself
but
it
seems
a
little
perverse
doesn
t
it
in
fact
twice
at
least
between
the
courses
at
dinner
i
caught
myself
being
sorry
for
her
it
is
when
you
think
of
it
so
remarkably
perverse
a
matter
of
duty
lady
mickleham
is
back
from
her
honeymoon
i
mean
young
lady
mickleham
dolly
foster
well
of
course
i
do
fancy
the
dowager
on
a
honeymoon
she
signified
the
fact
to
me
by
ordering
me
to
call
on
her
at
teatime
she
had
she
said
something
which
she
wished
to
consult
me
about
confidentially
i
went
i
didn
t
know
you
were
back
i
observed
oh
we
ve
been
back
a
fortnight
but
we
went
down
to
the
towers
they
were
all
there
all
who
all
archie
s
people
the
dowager
said
we
must
get
really
to
know
one
another
as
soon
as
possible
i
m
not
sure
i
like
really
knowing
people
it
means
that
they
say
whatever
they
like
to
you
and
don
t
get
up
out
of
your
favorite
chair
when
you
come
i
agree
said
i
that
a
soupcon
of
unfamiliarity
is
not
of
course
it
s
nice
to
be
one
of
the
family
she
continued
the
cat
is
that
said
i
i
would
not
give
a
fig
for
and
the
dowager
taught
me
the
ways
of
the
ah
she
taught
me
the
way
out
of
and
showed
me
how
to
be
most
disagreeable
to
the
it
is
the
first
lesson
of
a
and
told
me
what
archie
particularly
liked
and
how
bad
it
was
for
him
poor
what
should
we
do
without
our
mothers
i
do
not
however
see
how
i
can
help
in
all
this
lady
how
funny
that
sounds
aren
t
you
accustomed
to
your
dignity
yet
i
meant
from
you
i
smiled
that
is
dolly
s
way
as
miss
phaeton
says
she
means
no
harm
and
it
is
admirably
conducive
to
the
pleasure
of
a
it
wasn
t
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
she
continued
after
she
had
indulged
in
a
pensive
sigh
with
a
dutifully
bright
smile
and
a
glance
at
archie
s
photograph
to
follow
her
behavior
always
reminds
me
of
a
varied
and
well
assorted
menu
it
was
about
something
much
more
difficult
you
won
t
tell
archie
will
you
this
becomes
interesting
i
remarked
putting
my
hat
down
you
know
carter
that
before
i
was
married
oh
how
long
ago
it
seems
not
at
don
t
interrupt
that
before
i
was
married
i
had
several
that
is
to
say
several
well
several
start
quite
afresh
i
suggested
encouragingly
well
then
several
men
were
silly
enough
to
think
themselves
you
no
one
better
i
assented
cheerfully
oh
if
you
won
t
be
sensible
well
you
see
many
of
them
are
archie
s
friends
as
well
as
mine
and
of
course
they
ve
been
to
it
is
but
good
manners
said
i
one
of
them
waited
to
be
sent
for
leave
that
fellow
out
said
i
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this
and
i
believe
you
re
not
silly
really
you
know
except
when
you
choose
to
walk
in
the
row
any
afternoon
said
i
and
you
won
t
find
ten
wiser
it
s
this
ought
i
to
tell
archie
good
gracious
here
s
a
problem
of
course
pursued
lady
mickleham
opening
her
fan
it
s
in
some
ways
more
comfortable
that
he
shouldn
t
for
him
yes
and
for
me
but
then
it
doesn
t
seem
quite
to
him
yes
and
to
me
because
if
he
came
to
know
from
anybody
else
he
might
exaggerate
the
things
you
impossible
mr
carter
i
er
mean
he
knows
you
too
well
to
do
such
a
oh
i
see
thank
you
yes
what
do
you
think
what
does
the
dowager
say
i
haven
t
mentioned
it
to
the
but
surely
on
such
a
point
her
experience
she
can
t
have
any
said
lady
mickleham
decisively
i
believe
in
her
husband
because
i
must
but
nobody
else
you
re
not
giving
me
your
i
reflected
for
a
moment
haven
t
we
left
out
one
point
to
view
i
ventured
to
suggest
i
ve
thought
it
all
over
very
carefully
said
she
both
as
it
would
affect
me
and
as
it
would
affect
quite
so
now
suppose
you
think
how
it
would
affect
them
who
why
the
lady
mickleham
put
down
her
cup
of
tea
what
a
very
curious
idea
she
exclaimed
give
it
time
to
sink
in
said
i
helping
myself
to
another
piece
of
toast
she
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
presumably
to
allow
of
the
permeation
i
suggested
i
finished
my
tea
and
leant
back
comfortably
then
i
said
let
me
take
my
own
case
shouldn
t
i
feel
rather
awkward
oh
it
s
no
good
taking
your
case
she
interrupted
why
not
mine
as
well
as
another
because
i
told
him
about
you
long
i
was
not
surprised
but
i
could
not
permit
lady
mickleham
to
laugh
at
me
in
the
unconscionable
manner
in
which
she
proceeded
to
laugh
i
spread
out
my
hands
and
observed
blandly
why
not
be
guided
as
to
the
others
i
mean
by
your
husband
s
example
archie
s
example
what
s
that
i
don
t
know
but
you
do
i
what
do
you
mean
carter
she
asked
sitting
upright
well
has
he
ever
told
you
about
maggie
adeane
i
never
heard
of
or
lilly
courtenay
that
girl
or
alice
layton
the
layton
or
florence
cunliffe
who
was
she
or
millie
trehearne
she
squints
or
stop
stop
what
do
you
mean
what
should
he
tell
me
oh
i
see
he
hasn
t
nor
i
suppose
about
sylvia
fenton
or
that
little
delancy
girl
or
handsome
miss
what
was
her
name
hold
your
tongue
and
tell
me
what
you
lady
mickleham
said
i
gravely
if
your
husband
has
not
thought
fit
to
mention
these
ladies
and
others
whom
i
could
name
to
you
how
could
i
presume
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
archie
he
d
only
known
you
three
years
you
then
it
was
before
some
of
them
were
before
said
i
lady
mickleham
drew
a
long
breath
archie
will
be
in
soon
said
she
i
took
my
hat
it
seems
to
me
i
observed
that
what
is
sauce
that
i
should
say
husband
and
wife
ought
to
stand
on
an
equal
footing
in
these
matters
since
he
has
no
doubt
for
good
reasons
not
mentioned
to
you
alice
layton
was
a
positive
she
came
last
said
i
just
before
you
you
know
however
as
i
was
saying
and
that
horrible
sylvia
fenton
oh
he
couldn
t
have
known
you
long
then
as
i
was
saying
i
should
if
i
were
you
treat
him
as
he
has
treated
you
in
my
case
it
seems
to
be
too
i
m
sorry
i
told
him
oh
pray
don
t
mind
it
s
of
no
consequence
as
to
the
others
i
should
never
have
thought
it
of
archie
one
never
knows
said
i
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
don
t
suppose
he
thinks
it
of
i
won
t
tell
him
a
single
word
he
may
find
out
if
he
likes
who
was
the
last
girl
you
mentioned
is
it
any
use
trying
to
remember
all
their
names
i
asked
in
a
soothing
tone
no
doubt
he
s
forgotten
them
by
now
just
as
you
ve
forgotten
the
and
the
dowager
told
me
that
he
had
never
had
an
attachment
oh
if
the
dowager
said
that
of
course
the
dowager
would
know
don
t
be
so
silly
for
goodness
sake
are
you
going
certainly
i
am
it
might
annoy
archie
to
find
me
here
when
he
wants
to
talk
to
well
i
want
to
talk
to
of
course
you
won
t
repeat
what
i
ve
i
shall
find
out
for
myself
she
said
goodbye
i
hope
i
ve
removed
all
your
troubles
o
yes
thank
you
i
know
what
to
do
now
always
send
for
me
if
you
re
in
any
trouble
i
have
some
exp
goodbye
goodbye
lady
mickleham
and
remember
that
archie
like
you
yes
yes
i
know
must
you
go
i
m
afraid
i
must
i
ve
enjoyed
our
talk
so
there
s
archie
s
i
left
the
room
on
the
stairs
i
met
archie
i
shook
hands
sympathetically
i
was
sorry
for
archie
but
in
great
causes
the
individual
can
not
be
considered
i
had
done
my
duty
to
my
sex
my
last
chance
now
mind
said
hilary
musgrave
impressively
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
take
any
trouble
about
you
she
s
a
very
nice
girl
quite
pretty
and
she
ll
have
a
lot
of
money
you
can
be
very
pleasant
when
you
like
this
unsolicited
testimonial
which
isn
t
often
and
if
you
don
t
do
it
this
time
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
why
how
old
are
you
hush
you
must
be
nearly
it
s
false
false
false
come
along
said
hilary
and
she
added
over
her
shoulder
she
has
a
slight
it
might
have
been
scotch
said
i
she
plays
the
piano
a
good
it
might
have
been
the
fiddle
said
i
she
s
very
fond
of
it
might
have
been
ibsen
said
hilary
seeing
that
i
was
determined
to
look
on
the
bright
side
smiled
graciously
on
me
and
introduced
me
to
the
young
lady
she
was
decidedly
fresh
and
sincere
of
aspect
with
large
inquiring
eyes
eyes
which
i
felt
would
demand
a
little
too
much
of
me
at
breakfast
but
then
a
large
puts
that
all
right
miss
sophia
milton
carter
said
hilary
and
left
us
well
we
tried
the
theaters
first
but
as
she
had
only
been
to
the
lyceum
and
i
had
only
been
to
the
gaioety
we
soon
got
to
the
end
of
that
then
we
tried
art
she
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
degas
i
evaded
the
question
by
criticizing
a
drawing
of
a
horse
in
last
week
s
punch
which
she
hadn
t
seen
upon
this
she
started
literature
she
said
some
qualms
and
a
shiver
was
the
book
of
the
season
i
put
my
money
on
the
queen
of
the
dead
stop
again
and
i
saw
hilary
s
eye
upon
me
there
was
wrath
in
her
face
something
must
be
done
a
brilliant
idea
seized
me
i
had
read
that
of
the
culture
of
england
were
conservative
i
also
was
a
conservative
it
was
four
to
one
on
i
started
politics
i
could
have
whooped
for
joy
when
i
elicited
something
particularly
incisive
about
the
ignorance
of
the
masses
i
do
hope
you
agree
with
me
said
miss
milton
the
more
one
reads
and
thinks
the
more
one
sees
how
fatally
false
a
theory
it
is
that
the
ignorant
masses
people
such
as
i
have
described
can
ever
rule
a
great
the
empire
wants
gentlemen
that
s
what
it
wants
said
i
nodding
my
head
and
glancing
triumphantly
at
hilary
men
and
women
said
she
who
are
acquainted
with
the
best
that
has
been
said
and
thought
on
all
important
at
the
time
i
believed
this
observation
to
be
original
but
i
have
since
been
told
that
it
was
borrowed
i
was
delighted
with
it
yes
said
i
and
have
got
a
stake
in
the
country
you
know
and
know
how
to
behave
emselves
in
the
house
don
t
you
know
what
we
have
to
do
pursued
miss
milton
is
to
guide
the
voters
these
poor
rustics
need
to
be
informed
just
so
i
broke
in
they
have
to
be
told
of
the
real
nature
of
the
questions
and
which
candidate
to
or
they
must
infallibly
she
exclaimed
get
their
marching
orders
i
cried
in
rapture
it
was
exactly
what
i
always
did
on
my
small
property
oh
i
didn
t
quite
mean
that
she
said
reproachfully
oh
well
neither
did
i
quite
i
responded
adroitly
what
was
wrong
with
the
girl
now
but
with
the
help
of
the
league
she
went
on
do
you
belong
i
cried
more
delighted
than
ever
o
yes
said
she
i
think
it
s
a
duty
i
worked
very
hard
at
the
last
election
i
spent
days
distributing
packages
of
then
i
made
i
m
sorry
to
say
a
false
step
i
observed
interrupting
but
it
s
ticklish
work
now
eh
six
months
hard
wouldn
t
be
pleasant
would
it
what
do
you
mean
er
carter
she
asked
i
was
still
blind
i
believe
i
winked
and
i
m
sure
i
whispered
miss
milton
drew
herself
up
very
straight
i
do
not
bribe
she
said
what
i
distribute
is
now
i
suppose
that
pamphlets
and
blankets
don
t
really
sound
much
alike
but
i
was
agitated
quite
right
said
i
poor
old
things
they
can
t
afford
proper
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
was
not
joking
she
said
with
horrible
severity
neither
was
i
i
declared
in
humble
apology
didn
t
you
say
blankets
oh
there
was
a
long
pause
i
glanced
at
hilary
things
had
not
fallen
out
as
happily
as
they
might
but
i
did
not
mean
to
give
up
yet
i
see
you
re
right
i
said
still
humbly
to
descend
to
such
means
as
i
had
in
my
mind
is
to
throw
away
our
true
weapons
said
she
earnestly
she
sat
down
again
good
sign
what
we
really
need
i
began
is
a
reform
of
the
upper
classes
said
she
let
them
give
an
example
of
duty
of
of
i
was
not
to
be
caught
out
again
just
what
i
always
say
i
observed
impressively
let
them
put
away
their
horse
racing
their
betting
their
luxurious
living
their
you
re
right
miss
milton
said
i
let
them
set
an
example
of
they
should
i
assented
miss
milton
smiled
i
thought
we
agreed
really
said
she
i
m
sure
we
do
cried
i
and
i
winked
with
my
off
eye
at
hilary
as
i
sat
down
beside
miss
milton
now
i
heard
of
a
man
the
other
day
said
she
who
s
nearly
he
s
got
an
estate
in
the
country
he
never
goes
there
except
for
a
few
days
shooting
he
lives
in
town
he
spends
too
much
he
passes
an
absolutely
vacant
existence
in
a
round
of
empty
gaiety
he
has
by
no
means
a
good
reputation
he
dangles
about
wasting
his
time
and
his
money
is
that
the
sort
of
example
he
s
a
traitor
to
his
class
said
i
warmly
if
you
want
him
you
must
look
on
a
race
course
or
at
a
tailor
s
or
in
some
fashionable
woman
s
boudoir
and
his
estate
looks
after
itself
he
s
too
selfish
to
marry
too
idle
to
work
too
silly
to
i
began
to
be
sorry
for
this
man
in
spite
of
his
peccadilloes
i
wonder
if
i
ve
met
him
said
i
i
m
occasionally
in
town
when
i
can
get
time
to
run
up
what
s
his
name
i
don
t
think
i
heard
or
i
ve
forgotten
but
he
s
got
the
place
next
to
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
country
and
she
told
me
all
about
him
she
s
exactly
the
opposite
sort
of
person
or
she
wouldn
t
be
my
i
should
think
not
miss
milton
said
i
admiringly
oh
i
should
like
to
meet
that
man
and
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
said
she
such
men
as
he
do
more
harm
than
a
dozen
agitators
so
contemptible
too
it
s
revolting
to
think
of
said
i
i
m
so
glad
you
began
miss
milton
quite
confidentially
i
pulled
my
chair
a
trifle
closer
and
cast
an
apparently
careless
glance
towards
hilary
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
behind
me
eh
what
upon
my
honor
it
is
why
carter
my
boy
how
are
you
eh
what
miss
milton
too
i
declare
well
now
what
a
pity
annie
didn
t
come
i
disagreed
i
hate
annie
but
i
was
very
glad
to
see
my
friend
and
neighbor
robert
dinnerly
he
s
a
sensible
man
his
wife
s
a
little
prig
oh
dinnerly
cried
miss
milton
how
funny
that
you
should
come
just
now
i
was
just
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
a
man
dinnerly
told
me
about
i
was
telling
carter
about
him
you
know
well
miss
milton
perhaps
i
do
describe
i
don
t
believe
annie
ever
told
me
his
name
but
she
was
talking
about
him
at
our
house
but
i
wasn
t
there
miss
no
said
miss
milton
but
he
s
got
the
next
place
to
yours
in
the
i
positively
leaped
from
my
seat
why
good
gracious
carter
himself
you
mean
cried
dinnerly
laughing
well
that
is
a
good
un
she
turned
a
stony
glare
on
me
do
you
live
next
to
dinnerly
in
the
country
she
asked
i
would
have
denied
it
if
dinnerly
had
not
been
there
as
it
was
i
blew
my
nose
i
wonder
said
miss
milton
what
has
become
of
aunt
miss
milton
said
i
by
a
happy
chance
you
have
enjoyed
a
luxury
you
have
told
the
man
what
you
think
of
yes
said
she
and
i
have
only
to
add
that
he
is
also
a
pleasant
wasn
t
it
yet
hilary
says
it
was
my
fault
that
s
a
woman
all
over
the
little
wretch
seeing
that
little
johnny
tompkins
was
safely
out
of
the
country
under
injunctions
to
make
a
new
man
of
himself
and
to
keep
that
new
man
when
made
at
the
antipodes
i
could
not
see
anything
indiscreet
in
touching
on
the
matter
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
hilary
musgrave
in
point
of
fact
i
was
curious
to
find
out
what
she
knew
and
supposing
she
knew
what
she
thought
so
i
mentioned
little
johnny
tompkins
oh
the
little
wretch
cried
hilary
you
know
he
came
here
two
or
three
times
anybody
can
impose
on
happy
woman
i
i
mean
unhappy
man
and
how
much
was
it
he
stole
hard
on
a
thousand
said
i
for
a
time
you
know
he
was
quite
a
man
of
oh
i
know
he
came
here
in
his
own
hansom
perfectly
dressed
and
behaved
all
right
didn
t
he
yes
of
course
there
was
a
or
you
wouldn
t
have
been
deceived
said
i
with
a
smile
i
wasn
t
deceived
said
hilary
an
admirable
flush
appearing
on
her
cheeks
that
is
to
say
hilary
wouldn
oh
hilary
why
didn
t
his
employers
prosecute
him
carter
in
the
first
place
he
had
that
inestimable
advantage
in
a
career
of
dishonesty
respectable
well
but
still
his
widowed
mother
was
a
trump
you
do
you
mean
a
good
doubtless
she
was
but
i
mean
a
good
card
however
there
was
another
i
can
t
see
any
declared
hilary
i
m
going
to
surprise
you
said
i
hilary
interceded
for
hilary
you
didn
t
know
it
i
thought
not
well
he
why
he
always
pretended
to
want
him
to
be
cunning
hilary
said
i
he
used
to
speak
most
strongly
against
that
was
his
guile
said
i
oh
but
why
in
the
world
she
began
then
she
paused
and
went
on
again
it
was
nothing
to
do
with
hilary
went
with
me
to
see
him
you
know
while
they
had
him
under
lock
and
key
at
the
firm
s
did
he
i
never
heard
and
he
was
much
impressed
with
his
well
i
suppose
carter
that
if
he
was
really
penitent
never
saw
a
man
less
penitent
i
interrupted
he
gloried
in
his
crime
if
i
remember
his
exact
expression
it
was
that
the
jam
was
jolly
well
worth
the
powder
and
if
they
liked
to
send
him
to
chokee
they
could
and
be
and
suffer
accordingly
you
and
after
that
hilary
oh
anybody
can
impose
on
hilary
you
know
hilary
only
asked
what
the
jam
it
s
a
horrid
expression
but
i
suppose
it
meant
acting
the
part
of
a
gentleman
didn
t
it
not
entirely
according
to
what
he
told
hilary
johnny
was
in
oh
and
he
stole
for
some
wretched
now
do
be
careful
what
do
you
know
about
the
lady
the
lady
i
can
imagine
johnny
tompkin
s
s
ideal
so
can
i
if
you
come
to
and
she
must
have
known
his
money
wasn
t
his
why
must
she
i
asked
according
to
what
he
told
hilary
she
didn
i
don
t
believe
it
said
hilary
with
decision
hilary
believed
it
oh
hilary
but
then
hilary
knew
the
hilary
knew
you
mean
to
say
hilary
knew
no
one
better
said
i
composedly
hilary
rose
to
her
feet
who
was
the
creature
she
asked
sharply
come
i
expostulated
how
would
you
like
it
if
your
young
man
had
taken
to
theft
and
oh
nonsense
tell
me
her
name
please
johnny
told
hilary
that
just
to
see
her
and
talk
to
her
and
sit
by
her
side
was
worth
all
the
money
but
then
to
be
sure
it
was
somebody
else
s
money
and
that
he
d
do
it
again
to
get
what
he
had
got
over
again
then
i
m
sorry
to
say
he
and
hilary
believed
that
stuff
hilary
agreed
with
him
said
i
hilary
you
see
knows
the
what
s
her
name
carter
didn
t
you
notice
his
attentions
to
any
one
i
notice
you
don
t
mean
that
i
ve
seen
her
certainly
you
was
she
ever
here
yes
hilary
hilary
takes
care
of
i
shall
be
angry
in
a
minute
carter
oh
i
ll
have
this
out
of
hilary
i
who
was
she
according
to
what
he
told
hilary
she
was
the
most
fascinating
woman
in
the
world
hilary
thought
so
hilary
began
to
walk
up
and
down
oh
so
hilary
helped
to
let
him
go
because
they
both
precisely
said
i
and
you
dare
to
come
and
tell
me
well
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
said
i
hilary
s
just
as
mad
about
her
as
johnny
in
fact
he
said
he
d
be
hanged
if
he
wouldn
t
have
done
the
same
i
have
once
seen
madame
ristori
play
lady
macbeth
her
performance
was
recalled
to
me
by
the
tones
in
which
hilary
asked
who
is
this
woman
if
you
please
carter
so
hilary
got
him
off
gave
him
fifty
pounds
glad
to
get
him
away
perhaps
she
burst
out
in
angry
scorn
who
knows
said
i
her
name
demanded
lady
macbeth
i
mean
hilary
again
i
shan
t
tell
you
unless
you
promise
to
say
nothing
to
to
say
nothing
well
really
oh
all
right
and
i
took
up
my
hat
but
i
can
watch
them
can
t
i
as
much
as
you
won
t
you
tell
me
if
you
well
then
i
look
in
the
what
for
to
see
your
face
to
be
she
started
blushed
red
and
moved
a
step
towards
me
you
don
t
mean
she
cried
thou
art
the
woman
said
i
oh
but
he
never
said
a
word
johnny
had
his
code
said
i
and
in
some
ways
it
was
better
than
some
people
s
in
some
alas
and
hilary
really
you
know
better
than
i
do
whether
i
ve
told
the
truth
about
a
pause
ensued
then
hilary
made
three
short
remarks
which
i
give
in
their
order
the
little
wretch
dear
old
hilary
poor
little
man
i
took
my
hat
i
knew
that
hilary
was
due
from
the
city
in
a
few
minutes
hilary
sat
down
by
the
fire
how
dare
you
torment
me
so
she
asked
but
not
in
the
least
like
lady
macbeth
i
must
have
my
little
amusements
said
i
what
an
audacious
little
creature
said
hilary
fancy
his
daring
aren
t
you
astounded
oh
yes
i
am
but
hilary
you
see
it
s
nearly
his
time
said
hilary
i
buttoned
my
left
glove
and
held
out
my
right
hand
i
ve
a
good
mind
not
to
shake
hands
with
you
said
she
wasn
t
it
absurd
of
hilary
he
ought
to
have
been
all
the
more
of
course
he
the
presumption
of
it
and
hilary
smiled
i
also
smiled
that
poor
old
mother
of
his
reflected
hilary
where
did
you
say
she
lived
hilary
knows
the
address
said
i
silly
little
wretch
mused
hilary
still
smiling
goodbye
said
i
goodbye
said
hilary
i
turned
toward
the
door
and
had
laid
my
hand
on
the
knob
when
hilary
called
softly
mr
yes
said
i
turning
do
you
know
where
the
little
wretch
has
gone
oh
yes
said
i
i
i
suppose
you
don
t
ever
write
to
him
dear
me
no
said
i
but
you
could
suggested
hilary
of
course
said
i
she
jumped
up
and
ran
towards
me
her
purse
was
in
one
hand
and
a
bit
of
paper
fluttered
in
the
other
send
him
that
don
t
tell
him
she
whispered
and
her
voice
had
a
little
catch
in
it
poor
little
wretch
said
she
as
for
me
i
smiled
cynically
quite
cynically
you
know
for
it
was
very
absurd
please
do
said
hilary
and
i
went
supposing
it
had
been
another
woman
well
i
wonder
an
expensive
privilege
a
rather
uncomfortable
thing
happened
the
other
day
which
threatened
a
schism
in
my
acquaintance
and
put
me
in
a
decidedly
awkward
position
it
was
no
other
than
this
hilary
musgrave
had
definitely
informed
me
that
she
did
not
approve
of
lady
mickleham
the
attitude
is
no
doubt
a
conceivable
one
but
i
was
surprised
that
a
woman
of
hilary
s
large
sympathies
should
adopt
it
besides
hilary
is
quite
herself
the
history
of
the
affair
is
much
as
follows
i
called
on
hilary
to
see
whether
i
could
do
anything
and
she
told
me
all
about
it
it
appears
that
hilary
had
a
bad
cold
and
a
cousin
up
from
the
country
about
the
same
time
she
was
justly
aggrieved
at
the
double
event
and
being
unable
to
go
to
the
duchess
of
dexminster
s
squash
she
asked
dolly
mickleham
to
chaperon
little
miss
phyllis
little
miss
phyllis
of
course
knew
no
one
there
the
duchess
least
of
all
but
then
very
few
of
us
yes
i
was
there
knew
the
duchess
and
the
duchess
didn
t
know
any
of
us
i
saw
her
shake
hands
with
a
waiter
myself
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
an
hour
after
the
party
began
she
was
discovered
wandering
about
in
a
most
desolate
condition
dolly
had
told
her
that
she
would
be
in
a
certain
place
and
when
miss
phyllis
came
dolly
was
not
there
the
poor
little
lady
wandered
about
for
another
hour
looking
so
lost
that
one
was
inclined
to
send
for
a
policeman
and
then
she
sat
down
on
a
seat
by
the
wall
and
in
desperation
asked
her
neighbor
if
he
knew
lady
mickleham
by
sight
and
had
he
seen
her
lately
the
neighbor
by
way
of
reply
called
out
to
a
quiet
elderly
gentleman
who
was
sidling
unobtrusively
about
duke
are
there
any
particularly
snug
corners
in
your
house
the
duke
stopped
searched
his
memory
and
said
that
at
the
end
of
the
red
corridor
there
was
a
passage
and
that
a
few
yards
down
the
passage
if
you
turned
very
suddenly
to
the
right
you
would
come
on
a
little
nook
under
the
stairs
the
little
nook
just
held
a
settee
and
the
settee
the
duke
thought
might
just
hold
two
people
the
neighbor
thanked
the
duke
and
observed
to
miss
phyllis
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
take
you
to
lady
so
they
went
it
being
then
according
to
miss
phyllis
sworn
statement
precisely
two
hours
and
five
minutes
since
dolly
had
disappeared
and
pursuing
the
route
indicated
by
the
duke
they
found
lady
mickleham
and
lady
mickleham
exclaimed
good
gracious
my
dear
i
d
quite
forgotten
you
have
you
had
an
ice
do
take
her
to
have
an
ice
sir
sir
john
berry
was
the
neighbor
and
with
that
lady
mickleham
is
said
to
have
resumed
her
conversation
did
you
ever
hear
anything
more
atrocious
concluded
hilary
i
really
can
not
think
what
lord
mickleham
is
you
surely
mean
what
lady
mickleham
no
i
don
t
said
hilary
with
extraordinary
decision
anything
might
have
happened
to
that
poor
child
oh
there
were
not
many
of
the
aristocracy
present
said
i
soothingly
but
it
s
not
that
so
much
as
the
thing
itself
she
s
the
most
disgraceful
flirt
in
how
do
you
know
she
was
flirting
i
inquired
with
a
smile
how
do
i
know
echoed
hilary
it
is
a
very
hasty
conclusion
i
persisted
sometimes
i
stay
talking
with
you
for
an
hour
or
more
are
you
therefore
flirting
with
me
with
you
exclaimed
hilary
with
a
little
laugh
absurd
as
the
supposition
is
i
remarked
it
yet
serves
to
point
the
argument
lady
mickleham
might
have
been
talking
with
a
friend
just
in
the
quiet
rational
way
in
which
we
are
talking
i
don
t
think
that
s
likely
said
hilary
and
well
i
do
not
like
to
say
that
she
sniffed
it
would
convey
too
strong
an
idea
but
she
did
make
an
odd
little
sound
something
like
a
much
etherealized
sniff
i
smiled
again
and
more
broadly
i
was
enjoying
beforehand
the
little
victory
which
i
was
to
enjoy
over
hilary
yet
it
happens
to
be
true
said
hilary
was
magnificently
contemptuous
lord
mickleham
told
you
so
i
suppose
she
asked
and
i
suppose
lady
mickleham
told
him
poor
man
why
do
you
call
him
poor
man
oh
never
mind
did
he
tell
you
certainly
not
the
fact
is
hilary
and
really
you
must
excuse
me
for
having
kept
you
in
the
dark
a
little
it
amused
me
so
much
to
hear
your
hilary
rose
to
her
feet
well
what
are
you
going
to
say
she
asked
i
laughed
as
i
answered
why
i
was
the
man
with
lady
mickleham
when
your
friend
and
berry
inter
when
they
arrived
you
well
i
should
have
thought
i
should
still
think
that
she
would
have
been
pleased
relieved
you
know
to
find
her
uncharitable
opinion
erroneous
and
pleased
to
have
it
altered
on
the
best
authority
i
m
sure
that
is
how
i
should
have
felt
it
was
not
however
how
hilary
felt
i
am
deeply
pained
she
observed
after
a
long
pause
and
then
she
held
out
her
hand
i
was
sure
you
d
forgive
my
little
deception
said
i
grasping
it
i
thought
still
that
she
meant
to
bury
all
unkindness
i
should
never
have
thought
it
of
you
she
went
on
i
didn
t
know
your
friend
was
there
at
all
i
pleaded
for
by
now
i
was
alarmed
oh
please
don
t
shuffle
like
that
said
hilary
she
continued
to
stand
and
i
rose
to
my
feet
hilary
held
out
her
hand
again
do
you
mean
that
i
m
to
go
said
i
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
again
some
day
said
hilary
the
tone
suggested
that
she
was
looking
forward
to
some
future
existence
when
my
earthly
sins
should
have
been
sufficiently
purged
it
reminded
me
for
the
moment
of
king
arthur
and
queen
guinevere
but
i
protest
i
began
that
my
only
object
in
telling
you
was
to
show
you
how
absurd
is
it
any
good
talking
about
it
now
asked
hilary
a
discussion
might
possibly
be
fruitful
in
the
dim
futurity
before
mentioned
but
not
now
that
was
what
she
seemed
to
say
lady
mickleham
and
i
on
the
occasion
in
question
i
began
with
dignity
pray
spare
me
quote
hilary
with
much
greater
dignity
i
took
my
hat
shall
you
be
at
home
as
usual
on
thursday
i
asked
i
have
a
great
many
people
coming
already
she
remarked
i
can
take
a
hint
said
i
i
wish
you
d
take
warning
said
hilary
i
will
take
my
leave
said
i
and
i
did
leaving
hilary
in
a
tragic
attitude
in
the
middle
of
the
room
never
again
shall
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
lull
hilary
s
suspicions
a
day
or
two
after
this
very
trying
interview
lady
mickleham
s
victoria
happened
to
stop
opposite
where
i
was
seated
in
the
park
i
went
to
pay
my
respects
do
you
mean
to
leave
me
nothing
in
the
world
i
asked
just
by
way
of
introducing
the
subject
of
hilary
one
of
my
best
friends
has
turned
me
out
of
her
house
on
your
oh
do
tell
me
said
dolly
dimpling
all
over
her
face
so
i
told
her
i
made
the
story
as
long
as
i
could
for
reasons
connected
with
the
dimples
what
fun
exclaimed
dolly
i
told
you
at
the
time
that
a
young
unmarried
person
like
you
ought
to
be
more
i
am
just
debating
i
observed
whether
to
sacrifice
to
sacrifice
me
carter
of
course
i
explained
if
i
dropped
you
hilary
would
let
me
come
how
charming
that
would
be
cried
dolly
you
would
enjoy
her
nice
serious
conversation
all
about
hilary
she
is
apt
i
conceded
to
touch
on
hilary
but
she
is
very
oh
yes
she
s
handsome
said
dolly
there
was
a
pause
then
dolly
said
well
well
said
i
in
return
it
is
goodbye
asked
dolly
drawing
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
it
comes
to
this
i
remarked
supposing
i
forgive
you
as
if
it
was
my
fault
and
risk
hilary
s
wrath
did
you
speak
no
i
laughed
what
shall
i
get
out
of
it
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
it
shone
on
dolly
she
had
raised
her
parasol
but
she
blinked
a
little
beneath
it
she
was
smiling
slightly
still
and
the
dimple
stuck
to
its
post
like
a
sentinel
ready
to
rouse
the
rest
from
their
brief
repose
dolly
lay
back
in
the
victoria
nestling
luxuriously
against
the
soft
cushions
she
turned
her
eyes
for
a
moment
on
me
why
are
you
looking
at
me
she
asked
because
said
i
there
is
nothing
better
to
look
do
you
like
doing
it
asked
dolly
it
is
a
privilege
said
i
politely
well
then
said
dolly
but
i
ventured
to
observe
it
s
rather
an
expensive
then
you
mustn
t
have
it
very
and
it
is
shared
by
so
many
then
said
dolly
smiling
indulgently
you
must
have
it
a
little
oftener
home
roberts
i
am
not
yet
allowed
at
hilary
musgrave
s
a
very
dull
affair
to
hear
you
talk
remarked
hilary
musgrave
and
if
any
one
is
surprised
to
find
me
at
her
house
i
can
only
say
that
hilary
when
he
asked
me
to
take
a
was
quite
ignorant
of
any
ground
of
difference
between
his
wife
and
myself
and
that
hilary
could
not
very
well
eject
me
on
my
arrival
in
evening
dress
at
ten
minutes
to
eight
to
hear
you
talk
one
would
think
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
real
she
paused
i
smiled
now
she
continued
turning
a
fine
but
scornful
eye
upon
me
i
have
never
cared
for
any
man
in
the
world
except
my
i
smiled
again
poor
hilary
looked
very
uncomfortable
with
an
apologetic
air
he
began
to
stammer
something
about
parish
councils
i
was
not
to
be
diverted
by
any
such
maneuver
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
really
wish
to
talk
on
that
subject
would
a
person
who
had
never
eaten
anything
but
beef
make
a
boast
of
it
i
asked
hilary
grinned
covertly
hilary
pulled
the
lamp
nearer
and
took
up
her
embroidery
do
you
always
work
the
same
pattern
said
hilary
kicked
me
gently
hilary
made
no
direct
reply
but
presently
she
began
to
talk
i
was
just
about
phyllis
s
age
by
the
way
little
miss
phyllis
was
there
when
i
first
saw
hilary
you
remember
hilary
at
bournemouth
oh
er
was
it
bournemouth
said
hilary
with
much
carelessness
i
was
on
the
pier
pursued
hilary
i
had
a
red
frock
on
i
remember
and
one
of
those
big
hats
they
wore
that
year
hilary
wore
blue
serge
i
interpolated
encouragingly
yes
blue
serge
said
she
fondly
he
had
been
yachting
and
he
was
beautifully
burnt
i
was
horribly
burnt
wasn
t
i
hilary
hilary
began
to
pat
the
dog
then
we
got
to
know
one
stop
a
minute
said
i
how
did
that
happen
hilary
blushed
well
we
were
both
always
on
the
pier
she
explained
and
and
somehow
hilary
got
to
know
father
and
and
father
introduced
him
to
i
m
glad
it
was
no
worse
said
i
was
considering
miss
phyllis
who
sat
listening
and
then
you
know
father
wasn
t
always
there
and
once
or
twice
we
met
on
the
cliff
do
you
remember
that
morning
hilary
what
morning
asked
hilary
patting
the
dog
with
immense
assiduity
why
the
morning
i
had
my
white
serge
on
i
d
been
bathing
and
my
hair
was
down
to
dry
and
you
said
i
looked
like
a
do
mermaids
wear
white
serge
i
asked
but
nobody
took
the
least
notice
of
me
quite
properly
and
you
told
me
such
a
lot
about
yourself
and
then
we
found
we
were
late
for
yes
said
hilary
suddenly
forgetting
the
dog
and
your
mother
gave
me
an
awful
yes
and
then
you
told
me
that
you
were
very
poor
but
that
you
couldn
t
help
it
and
you
said
you
supposed
i
couldn
t
possibly
well
i
didn
t
think
and
i
said
you
were
a
silly
old
thing
and
then
hilary
stopped
abruptly
how
lovely
remarked
little
miss
phyllis
in
a
wistful
voice
and
do
you
remember
pursued
hilary
laying
down
her
embroidery
and
clasping
her
hands
on
her
knees
the
morning
you
went
to
see
father
what
a
row
there
was
said
hilary
and
what
an
awful
week
it
was
after
that
i
was
never
so
miserable
in
all
my
life
i
cried
till
my
eyes
were
quite
red
and
then
i
bathed
them
for
an
hour
and
then
i
went
to
the
pier
and
you
were
there
and
i
mightn
t
speak
to
you
i
remember
said
hilary
nodding
gently
and
then
hilary
father
sent
for
me
and
told
me
it
was
no
use
and
i
said
i
d
never
marry
any
one
else
and
father
said
there
there
don
t
cry
we
ll
see
what
mother
your
mother
was
a
brick
said
hilary
poking
the
fire
and
that
night
they
never
told
me
anything
about
it
and
i
didn
t
even
change
my
frock
but
came
down
looking
horrible
just
as
i
was
in
an
old
black
rag
no
hilary
don
t
say
it
was
pretty
hilary
unconvinced
shook
his
head
and
when
i
walked
into
the
drawing
room
there
was
nobody
there
but
just
you
and
we
neither
of
us
said
anything
for
ever
so
long
and
then
father
and
mother
came
in
and
do
you
remember
after
dinner
hilary
i
remember
said
hilary
there
was
a
long
pause
hilary
was
looking
into
the
fire
little
miss
phyllis
s
eyes
were
fixed
in
rapt
gaze
on
the
ceiling
hilary
was
looking
at
his
wife
i
thinking
it
safest
was
regarding
my
own
boots
at
last
miss
phyllis
broke
the
silence
how
perfectly
lovely
she
said
yes
said
hilary
reflectively
and
we
were
married
three
months
tenth
of
june
said
hilary
reflectively
and
we
had
the
most
charming
little
rooms
in
the
world
do
you
remember
those
first
rooms
dear
so
tiny
not
bad
little
rooms
said
hilary
how
awfully
lovely
cried
little
miss
phyllis
i
felt
that
it
was
time
to
interfere
and
is
that
all
i
asked
all
how
do
you
mean
said
hilary
with
a
slight
start
well
i
mean
did
nothing
else
happen
weren
t
there
any
complications
weren
t
there
any
more
troubles
or
any
more
opposition
or
any
misunderstandings
or
anything
no
said
hilary
you
never
quarreled
or
broke
it
off
nobody
came
between
you
no
it
all
went
just
perfectly
why
of
course
it
hilary
s
people
made
themselves
nasty
perhaps
i
suggested
with
a
ray
of
hope
they
fell
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
said
hilary
then
i
rose
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
fire
i
do
not
know
i
observed
what
miss
phyllis
thinks
about
it
i
think
it
was
just
perfect
but
for
my
part
i
can
only
say
that
i
never
heard
of
such
a
dull
affair
in
all
my
dull
gasped
miss
phyllis
dull
murmured
hilary
dull
chuckled
hilary
it
was
said
i
severely
without
a
spark
of
interest
from
beginning
to
end
such
things
happen
by
thousands
it
s
commonplaceness
itself
i
had
some
hopes
when
you
father
assumed
a
firm
attitude
but
mother
was
such
a
dear
interrupted
hilary
just
so
she
gave
away
the
whole
situation
then
i
did
trust
that
hilary
would
lose
his
place
or
develop
an
old
flame
or
do
something
just
a
little
it
was
a
perfect
time
said
hilary
i
wonder
why
in
the
world
you
told
me
about
it
i
pursued
i
don
t
know
why
i
did
said
hilary
dreamily
the
only
possible
excuse
for
an
engagement
like
that
i
observed
is
to
be
found
in
intense
hilary
rose
and
advanced
towards
his
wife
your
embroidery
s
falling
on
the
floor
said
he
not
a
bit
of
it
said
i
yes
it
is
he
persisted
and
he
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
to
her
miss
phyllis
smiled
delightedly
hilary
had
squeezed
his
wife
s
hand
then
we
don
t
excuse
it
said
he
i
took
out
my
watch
i
was
not
finding
much
entertainment
surely
it
s
quite
early
old
man
said
hilary
it
s
nearly
eleven
we
ve
spent
on
the
thing
said
i
peevishly
holding
out
my
hand
to
my
hostess
oh
are
you
going
good
night
i
turned
to
miss
phyllis
i
hope
you
won
t
think
all
love
affairs
are
like
that
i
said
but
i
saw
her
lips
begin
to
shape
into
lovely
and
i
hastily
left
the
room
hilary
came
to
help
me
on
with
my
coat
he
looked
extremely
apologetic
and
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
awfully
sorry
old
chap
said
he
that
we
bored
you
with
our
reminiscences
i
know
of
course
that
they
can
t
be
very
interesting
to
other
people
women
are
so
confoundedly
don
t
try
that
on
me
said
i
much
disgusted
you
were
just
as
bad
he
laughed
as
he
leant
against
the
door
she
did
look
ripping
in
that
white
frock
he
said
with
her
hair
stop
said
i
firmly
she
looked
just
like
a
lot
of
other
i
m
hanged
if
she
did
said
hilary
then
he
glanced
at
me
with
a
puzzled
sort
of
expression
i
say
old
man
weren
t
you
ever
that
way
yourself
he
asked
i
hailed
a
hansom
cab
because
if
you
were
you
know
you
d
understand
how
a
fellow
remembers
every
good
night
said
i
at
least
i
suppose
you
re
not
coming
to
the
club
well
i
think
not
said
hilary
old
fellow
sorry
we
bored
you
of
course
if
a
man
has
never
never
i
groaned
a
score
of
times
well
then
doesn
t
it
no
said
i
it
s
just
that
that
makes
stories
like
yours
so
infernally
what
asked
hilary
for
i
had
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
uninteresting
said
i
getting
into
my
cab
strange
but
true
the
other
day
my
young
cousin
george
lunched
with
me
he
is
a
cheery
youth
and
a
member
of
the
university
of
oxford
he
refreshes
me
very
much
and
i
believe
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
affording
him
some
matter
for
thought
on
this
occasion
however
he
was
extremely
silent
and
depressed
i
said
little
but
made
an
extremely
good
luncheon
afterwards
we
proceeded
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
park
sam
old
boy
said
george
suddenly
i
m
the
most
miserable
devil
i
don
t
know
what
else
you
expect
at
your
age
i
observed
lighting
a
cigar
he
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
i
say
sam
old
boy
when
you
were
young
were
you
ever
he
paused
arranged
his
neckcloth
it
was
more
like
a
oh
the
fashion
of
course
i
know
that
and
blushed
a
fine
crimson
was
i
ever
what
george
i
had
the
curiosity
to
ask
oh
well
hard
hit
you
know
a
girl
you
in
love
you
mean
george
no
i
never
never
no
are
you
yes
hang
it
then
he
looked
at
me
with
a
puzzled
air
and
continued
i
say
though
sam
it
s
awfully
funny
you
shouldn
t
have
don
t
you
know
what
it
s
like
then
how
should
i
i
inquired
apologetically
what
is
it
like
george
george
took
my
arm
it
s
just
hades
he
informed
me
confidentially
then
i
remarked
i
have
no
reason
to
regret
still
you
know
interrupted
george
it
s
not
half
that
appears
to
me
to
be
a
paradox
i
observed
it
s
precious
hard
to
explain
it
to
you
if
you
ve
never
felt
it
said
george
in
rather
an
injured
tone
but
what
i
say
is
quite
i
shouldn
t
think
of
contradicting
you
my
dear
fellow
i
hastened
to
say
let
s
sit
down
said
he
and
watch
the
people
driving
we
may
see
somebody
somebody
we
know
you
know
so
we
may
said
i
and
we
sat
down
a
fellow
pursued
george
with
knitted
brows
is
all
turned
upside
down
don
t
you
know
how
very
peculiar
i
exclaimed
one
moment
he
s
the
happiest
dog
in
the
world
and
the
next
well
the
next
it
s
the
but
i
objected
not
surely
without
good
reason
for
such
a
change
reason
bosh
the
least
thing
does
i
flicked
the
ash
from
my
cigar
it
may
i
remarked
affect
you
in
this
extraordinary
way
but
surely
it
is
not
so
with
most
people
perhaps
not
george
conceded
most
people
are
very
likely
the
explanation
lies
in
that
fact
said
i
i
didn
t
mean
you
old
chap
said
george
with
a
penitence
which
showed
that
he
had
meant
me
oh
all
right
all
right
said
i
but
when
a
man
s
really
far
gone
there
s
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
that
seems
to
me
not
to
be
a
healthy
condition
said
i
healthy
oh
you
old
idiot
sam
who
s
talking
of
health
now
only
last
night
i
met
her
at
a
dance
i
had
five
dances
with
her
talked
to
her
half
the
evening
in
fact
well
you
d
think
that
would
last
some
time
wouldn
t
you
i
should
certainly
have
supposed
so
i
assented
so
it
would
with
most
chaps
i
dare
say
but
with
me
confound
it
i
feel
as
if
i
hadn
t
seen
her
for
six
months
but
my
dear
george
that
s
surely
rather
absurd
as
you
tell
me
you
spent
a
long
while
with
the
young
person
the
young
person
you
ve
not
told
me
her
name
you
no
and
i
shan
t
i
wonder
if
she
ll
be
at
the
musgraves
tonight
you
re
sure
said
i
soothingly
to
meet
her
somewhere
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
george
looked
at
me
then
he
observed
with
a
bitter
laugh
it
s
pretty
evident
you
ve
never
had
it
you
re
as
bad
as
those
chaps
who
write
well
but
surely
they
often
describe
with
sufficient
warmth
and
er
color
oh
i
dare
say
but
it
s
all
wrong
at
least
it
s
not
what
i
feel
then
look
at
the
girls
in
books
all
beasts
george
spoke
with
much
vehemence
so
that
i
was
led
to
say
the
lady
you
are
preoccupied
with
is
i
suppose
handsome
george
turned
swiftly
round
on
me
look
here
can
you
hold
your
tongue
sam
i
nodded
then
i
m
hanged
if
i
won
t
point
her
out
to
you
that
s
uncommon
good
of
you
george
said
i
then
you
ll
see
continued
george
but
it
s
not
only
her
looks
you
know
she
s
the
most
he
stopped
looking
round
to
see
why
i
observed
that
his
face
was
red
he
clutched
his
walking
stick
tightly
in
his
left
hand
his
right
hand
was
trembling
as
if
it
wanted
to
jump
up
to
his
hat
here
she
comes
look
look
he
whispered
directing
my
eyes
towards
the
lines
of
carriages
which
rolled
past
us
i
observed
a
girl
in
a
victoria
by
her
side
sat
a
portly
lady
of
middle
age
the
girl
was
decidedly
like
the
lady
a
description
of
the
lady
would
not
i
imagine
be
interesting
the
girl
blushed
slightly
and
bowed
george
and
i
lifted
our
hats
the
victoria
and
its
occupants
were
gone
george
leant
back
with
a
sigh
after
a
moment
he
said
well
that
was
there
was
expectancy
in
his
tone
she
has
an
extremely
prepossessing
appearance
i
observed
there
isn
t
said
george
a
girl
in
london
to
touch
her
sam
old
boy
i
believe
i
believe
she
likes
me
a
i
m
sure
she
must
george
said
i
and
indeed
i
thought
so
the
governor
s
infernally
unreasonable
said
george
fretfully
oh
you
ve
mentioned
it
to
him
i
sounded
him
oh
you
may
be
sure
he
didn
t
see
what
i
was
up
to
i
put
it
quite
generally
he
talked
rot
about
getting
on
in
the
world
who
wants
to
get
on
who
indeed
said
i
it
is
only
changing
what
you
are
for
something
no
and
about
waiting
till
i
know
my
own
mind
isn
t
it
enough
to
look
at
her
ample
in
my
opinion
said
george
rose
to
his
feet
they
ve
gone
to
a
party
they
won
t
come
round
again
said
he
we
may
as
well
go
mayn
t
we
i
was
very
comfortable
so
i
said
timidly
we
might
see
somebody
else
we
oh
somebody
else
be
hanged
who
wants
to
see
em
i
m
sure
i
don
said
i
hastily
as
i
rose
from
my
armchair
which
was
at
once
snapped
up
we
were
about
to
return
to
the
club
when
i
observed
lady
mickleham
s
barouche
standing
under
the
trees
i
invited
george
to
come
and
be
introduced
he
displayed
great
indifference
she
gives
a
good
many
parties
said
i
and
perhaps
by
jove
yes
i
may
as
well
said
george
glad
you
had
the
sense
to
think
of
that
old
so
i
took
him
up
to
dolly
and
presented
him
dolly
was
very
gracious
george
is
an
evidently
presentable
boy
we
fell
into
conversation
my
cousin
lady
mickleham
said
i
has
been
telling
me
oh
shut
up
sam
said
george
not
however
appearing
very
angry
about
a
subject
on
which
you
can
assist
him
more
than
i
can
inasmuch
as
you
are
married
he
is
in
dolly
glanced
at
george
oh
what
fun
said
she
fun
cried
george
i
mean
how
awfully
interesting
said
dolly
suddenly
transforming
her
expression
and
he
wanted
to
be
introduced
to
you
because
you
might
ask
her
and
him
to
george
became
red
and
began
to
stammer
an
apology
oh
i
don
t
believe
him
said
dolly
kindly
he
always
makes
people
uncomfortable
if
he
can
what
were
you
telling
him
george
it
s
no
use
telling
him
anything
he
can
t
understand
said
george
is
she
very
asked
dolly
fixing
doubtfully
grave
eyes
on
my
young
cousin
sam
s
seen
her
said
he
in
an
excess
of
shyness
dolly
turned
to
me
for
an
opinion
and
i
gave
one
she
is
just
said
i
as
charming
as
he
thinks
dolly
leant
over
to
my
cousin
and
whispered
tell
me
her
and
he
whispered
something
back
to
dolly
it
s
awfully
kind
of
you
lady
mickleham
he
said
i
am
a
kind
old
thing
said
dolly
all
over
dimples
i
can
easily
get
to
know
oh
you
really
are
awfully
kind
lady
dolly
smiled
upon
him
waved
her
hand
to
me
and
drove
off
crying
do
try
to
make
carter
understand
we
were
left
along
george
wore
a
meditative
smile
presently
he
roused
himself
to
say
she
s
really
a
very
kind
woman
she
s
so
sympathetic
she
s
not
like
you
i
expect
she
felt
it
once
herself
you
one
can
never
tell
said
i
carelessly
perhaps
she
did
george
fell
to
brooding
again
i
thought
i
would
try
an
experiment
not
altogether
either
is
she
i
asked
lighting
a
cigarette
george
started
what
oh
well
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
some
people
might
think
he
paused
and
added
with
a
bashful
knowing
smile
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
go
into
raptures
about
her
can
you
old
man
i
turned
my
head
away
but
he
caught
me
oh
you
needn
t
smile
in
that
infernally
patronizing
way
he
cried
angrily
upon
my
word
george
said
i
i
don
t
know
that
i
the
very
latest
thing
it
s
the
very
latest
thing
said
lady
mickleham
standing
by
the
table
in
the
smoking
room
and
holding
an
album
in
her
hand
i
wish
it
had
been
a
little
later
still
said
i
for
i
felt
embarrassed
you
promise
on
your
honor
to
be
absolutely
sincere
you
know
and
then
you
write
what
you
think
of
me
see
what
a
lot
of
opinions
i
ve
got
already
and
she
held
up
the
thick
album
it
would
be
extremely
interesting
to
read
them
i
observed
oh
but
they
re
quite
confidential
said
dolly
that
s
part
of
the
i
don
t
appreciate
that
part
said
i
perhaps
you
will
when
you
ve
written
yours
suggested
lady
mickleham
meanwhile
mayn
t
i
see
the
dowager
s
well
i
ll
show
you
a
little
bit
of
the
dowager
s
look
here
our
dear
dorothea
is
still
perhaps
just
a
thought
wanting
in
seriousness
but
the
sense
of
her
position
is
having
a
sobering
i
hope
not
i
exclaimed
apprehensively
whose
is
this
archie
may
i
see
a
bit
not
a
bit
said
dolly
archie
s
is
is
rather
foolish
so
i
suppose
said
i
dear
boy
said
dolly
reflectively
i
hate
sentiment
said
i
here
s
a
long
one
who
wrote
oh
you
mustn
t
look
at
that
not
at
that
above
all
why
above
all
i
asked
with
some
severity
dolly
smiled
then
she
observed
in
a
soothing
tone
perhaps
it
won
t
be
above
all
when
you
ve
written
yours
by
the
way
i
said
carelessly
i
suppose
archie
sees
all
of
them
he
has
never
asked
to
see
them
answered
lady
mickleham
the
reply
seemed
satisfactory
of
course
archie
had
only
to
ask
i
took
a
clean
quill
and
prepared
to
write
you
promise
to
be
sincere
you
know
dolly
reminded
me
i
laid
down
my
pen
impossible
said
i
firmly
o
but
why
carter
there
would
be
an
end
of
our
do
you
think
as
badly
of
me
as
all
that
asked
dolly
with
a
rueful
air
i
leant
back
in
my
chair
and
looked
at
dolly
she
looked
at
me
she
smiled
i
may
have
smiled
yes
said
i
then
you
needn
t
write
it
quite
all
down
said
dolly
i
am
obliged
said
i
taking
up
my
pen
you
mustn
t
say
what
isn
t
true
but
you
needn
t
say
everything
that
is
that
might
be
true
explained
dolly
this
again
seemed
satisfactory
i
began
to
write
dolly
sitting
opposite
me
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
watching
me
after
ten
minutes
steady
work
which
included
several
pauses
for
reflection
i
threw
down
the
pen
leant
back
in
my
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
now
read
it
said
dolly
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
it
is
on
the
whole
i
observed
no
really
said
dolly
yet
you
promised
to
be
you
would
not
have
had
me
disagreeable
i
asked
that
s
a
different
thing
said
dolly
read
it
lady
mickleham
i
read
is
usually
accounted
a
person
of
considerable
attractions
she
is
widely
popular
and
more
than
one
woman
has
been
known
to
like
i
don
t
quite
understand
that
interrupted
dolly
it
is
surely
simple
said
i
and
i
read
on
without
delay
she
is
kind
even
to
her
husband
and
takes
the
utmost
pains
to
conceal
from
her
anything
calculated
to
distress
that
i
suppose
you
mean
that
to
be
nice
said
dolly
of
course
i
answered
and
i
proceeded
she
never
gives
pain
to
any
one
except
with
the
object
of
giving
pleasure
to
somebody
else
and
her
kindness
is
no
less
widely
diffused
than
it
is
hearty
and
that
really
is
nice
said
dolly
smiling
thank
you
said
i
smiling
also
she
is
very
charitable
she
takes
a
pleasure
in
encouraging
the
shy
and
bashful
how
do
you
know
that
asked
dolly
while
i
pursued
suffering
without
impatience
a
considerable
amount
of
you
can
t
know
whether
i
m
patient
or
not
remarked
dolly
i
m
she
thinks
i
read
on
no
evil
of
the
most
attractive
of
women
and
has
a
smile
for
the
most
unattractive
of
you
put
that
very
nicely
said
dolly
nodding
the
former
may
constantly
be
seen
in
her
house
and
the
latter
at
least
as
often
as
many
people
would
think
here
for
some
reason
dolly
laughed
her
intellectual
powers
are
not
thank
you
she
can
say
what
she
means
on
the
occasions
on
which
she
wishes
to
do
so
and
she
is
at
other
times
equally
capable
of
meaning
much
more
than
she
would
be
likely
to
how
do
you
mean
that
carter
please
it
explains
itself
said
i
and
i
proceeded
the
fact
of
her
receiving
a
remark
with
disapprobation
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
causes
her
displeasure
nor
must
it
be
assumed
that
she
did
not
expect
a
visitor
merely
on
the
ground
that
she
greets
him
with
here
i
observed
lady
mickleham
looking
at
me
rather
suspiciously
i
don
t
think
that
s
quite
nice
of
you
carter
she
said
pathetically
lady
mickleham
is
in
short
i
went
on
coming
to
my
peroration
equally
deserving
of
esteem
and
affection
esteem
and
affection
that
sounds
just
right
said
dolly
approvingly
and
those
who
have
been
admitted
to
the
enjoyment
of
her
friendship
are
unanimous
in
discouraging
all
others
from
seeking
a
similar
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
lady
mickleham
are
unanimous
i
repeated
slowly
and
distinctly
in
discouraging
all
others
from
seeking
a
similar
dolly
looked
at
me
with
her
brow
slightly
puckered
i
leant
back
puffing
at
my
cigarette
presently
for
there
was
quite
a
long
pause
dolly
s
lips
curved
my
mental
powers
are
not
despicable
she
observed
i
have
said
so
said
i
i
think
i
see
she
remarked
is
there
anything
wrong
i
asked
anxiously
said
dolly
not
exactly
wrong
in
fact
i
rather
think
i
like
that
last
bit
best
still
don
t
you
think
she
rose
came
round
the
table
took
up
the
pen
and
put
it
back
in
my
hand
what
s
this
for
i
asked
to
correct
the
mistake
said
dolly
do
you
really
think
so
said
i
i
m
afraid
so
said
dolly
i
took
the
pen
and
made
a
certain
alteration
dolly
took
up
the
album
are
unanimous
she
read
in
encouraging
all
others
to
seek
a
similar
yes
you
meant
that
you
know
i
suppose
i
must
have
said
i
rather
sulkily
the
other
was
nonsense
urged
dolly
oh
utter
nonsense
said
i
and
you
had
to
write
the
truth
yes
i
had
to
write
some
of
and
nonsense
can
t
be
the
truth
can
it
carter
of
course
it
can
t
lady
where
are
you
going
carter
she
asked
for
i
rose
from
my
chair
to
have
a
quiet
smoke
said
i
alone
asked
dolly
yes
alone
said
i
walked
towards
the
door
dolly
stood
by
the
table
fingering
the
album
i
had
almost
reached
the
door
then
i
happened
to
look
round
mr
carter
said
dolly
as
though
a
new
idea
had
struck
her
what
is
it
lady
mickleham
well
you
know
carter
i
i
shall
try
to
forget
that
mistake
of
you
re
very
kind
lady
but
said
dolly
with
a
troubled
smile
i
i
m
quite
afraid
i
shan
t
succeed
after
all
the
smoking
room
is
meant
for
smoking
an
uncounted
hour
we
were
standing
lady
mickleham
and
i
at
a
door
which
led
from
the
morning
room
to
the
terrace
at
the
towers
i
was
on
a
visit
to
the
historic
pile
by
vanbrugh
out
of
the
money
accumulated
by
the
third
earl
paymaster
to
the
forces
temp
queen
anne
the
morning
room
is
a
large
room
archie
was
somewhere
in
it
lady
mickleham
held
a
jar
containing
pate
de
foie
gras
from
time
to
time
she
dug
a
piece
out
with
a
fork
and
flung
the
morsel
to
a
big
retriever
which
was
sitting
on
the
terrace
the
morning
was
fine
but
cloudy
lady
mickleham
wore
blue
the
dog
swallowed
the
pate
with
greediness
it
s
so
bad
for
him
sighed
she
but
the
dear
likes
it
so
how
human
the
creatures
are
said
i
do
you
know
pursued
lady
mickleham
that
the
dowager
says
i
m
extravagant
she
thinks
dogs
ought
not
to
be
fed
on
pate
de
foie
your
extravagance
i
observed
is
probably
due
to
your
having
been
brought
up
on
a
moderate
income
i
have
felt
the
effect
of
course
said
dolly
we
are
hit
by
the
agricultural
the
carters
also
i
murmured
are
landed
after
all
i
don
t
see
much
point
in
economy
do
you
carter
economy
i
remarked
putting
my
hands
in
my
pockets
is
going
without
something
you
do
want
in
case
you
should
some
day
want
something
which
you
probably
won
t
isn
t
that
clever
asked
dolly
in
an
apprehensive
tone
oh
dear
no
i
answered
reassuringly
anybody
can
do
that
if
they
care
to
try
you
dolly
tossed
a
piece
of
pate
to
the
retriever
i
have
made
a
discovery
lately
i
observed
what
are
you
two
talking
about
called
archie
you
re
not
meant
to
hear
said
dolly
without
turning
round
yet
if
it
s
a
discovery
he
ought
to
hear
he
s
made
a
good
many
lately
said
dolly
she
dug
out
the
last
bit
of
pate
flung
it
to
the
dog
and
handed
the
empty
pot
to
me
don
t
be
so
allegorical
i
implored
besides
it
s
really
not
just
to
archie
no
doubt
the
dog
is
a
nice
one
but
how
foolish
you
are
this
morning
what
s
the
discovery
an
entirely
surprising
oh
but
let
me
hear
it
s
nothing
about
archie
is
it
no
i
ve
told
you
all
archie
s
nor
hilary
i
wish
it
was
hilary
shall
we
walk
on
the
terrace
i
suggested
oh
yes
let
s
said
dolly
stepping
out
and
putting
on
a
hat
which
she
caught
up
from
a
chair
hard
by
it
isn
t
hilary
she
added
sitting
down
on
a
garden
seat
no
said
i
leaning
on
a
sundial
which
stood
by
the
seat
well
what
is
it
it
is
simple
said
i
and
serious
it
is
not
therefore
like
you
lady
it
s
like
hilary
said
dolly
no
because
it
isn
t
pleasant
by
the
way
you
are
jealous
of
hilary
dolly
said
nothing
at
all
she
took
off
her
hat
roughened
her
hair
a
little
and
assumed
an
effective
pose
still
it
is
a
fact
for
what
it
is
worth
that
she
doesn
t
care
much
about
hilary
the
discovery
i
continued
is
that
i
m
growing
you
are
said
dolly
spearing
her
hat
with
its
long
pin
i
was
very
naturally
nettled
at
this
so
will
you
be
soon
i
retorted
not
soon
said
dolly
some
day
i
insisted
after
a
pause
of
about
half
a
minute
dolly
said
i
suppose
you
will
become
i
pursued
idly
drawing
patterns
with
my
finger
on
the
sundial
wrinkled
rough
fat
and
perhaps
you
re
very
disagreeable
today
said
dolly
she
rose
and
stood
by
me
what
do
the
mottoes
mean
she
asked
there
were
two
i
will
not
say
they
contradicted
one
another
but
they
looked
at
life
from
different
points
of
view
pereunt
et
imputantur
i
read
well
what
s
that
carter
a
trite
but
offensive
assertion
said
i
lighting
a
cigarette
but
what
does
it
mean
she
asked
a
pucker
on
her
forehead
what
does
it
matter
said
i
let
s
try
the
the
other
is
and
better
horas
non
numero
nisi
and
what
s
that
i
translated
literally
dolly
clapped
her
hands
and
her
face
gleamed
with
smiles
i
like
that
one
she
cried
stop
said
i
imperatively
you
ll
set
it
moving
it
s
very
sensible
said
she
more
freely
rendered
it
means
i
live
only
when
you
by
jove
remarked
archie
coming
up
behind
us
pipe
in
mouth
there
was
a
lot
of
rain
last
night
i
ve
just
measured
it
in
the
some
people
measure
everything
said
i
with
a
displeased
air
it
is
a
detestable
archie
what
does
pereunt
et
imputantur
mean
eh
oh
i
see
well
i
say
carter
oh
well
you
know
i
suppose
it
means
you
ve
got
to
pay
for
your
fun
doesn
t
it
oh
is
that
all
i
was
afraid
it
was
something
horrid
why
did
you
frighten
me
carter
i
think
it
is
rather
horrid
said
i
why
it
isn
t
even
true
said
dolly
scornfully
now
when
i
heard
this
ancient
and
respectable
legend
thus
cavalierly
challenged
i
fell
to
studying
it
again
and
presently
i
exclaimed
yes
you
re
right
if
it
said
that
it
wouldn
t
be
true
but
archie
translated
it
well
you
have
a
shot
suggested
archie
the
oysters
are
eaten
and
put
down
in
the
bill
said
i
and
you
will
observe
archie
that
it
does
not
say
in
whose
ah
said
dolly
well
somebody
s
got
to
pay
persisted
archie
oh
yes
somebody
laughed
dolly
well
i
don
t
know
said
archie
i
suppose
the
chap
that
has
the
fun
it
s
not
always
a
chap
observed
dolly
well
then
the
individual
amended
archie
i
suppose
he
d
have
to
it
doesn
t
say
so
i
remarked
mildly
and
according
to
my
small
experience
i
m
quite
sure
your
meaning
is
right
carter
said
dolly
in
an
authoritative
tone
as
for
the
other
motto
archie
said
i
it
merely
means
that
a
woman
considers
all
hours
wasted
which
she
does
not
spend
in
the
society
of
her
oh
come
you
don
t
gammon
me
said
archie
it
means
that
the
sun
don
t
shine
unless
it
s
fine
you
archie
delivered
this
remarkable
discovery
in
a
tone
of
great
self
satisfaction
oh
you
dear
old
thing
said
dolly
well
it
does
you
know
said
he
there
was
a
pause
archie
kissed
his
wife
i
am
not
complaining
he
has
of
course
a
perfect
right
to
kiss
his
wife
and
strolled
away
toward
the
hothouses
i
lit
another
cigarette
then
dolly
pointing
to
the
stem
of
the
dial
cried
why
here
s
another
inscription
oh
and
in
english
she
was
right
there
was
another
carelessly
scratched
on
the
old
battered
column
nearly
effaced
for
the
characters
had
been
but
lightly
marked
and
yet
not
as
i
conceived
from
the
tenor
of
the
words
very
old
what
is
it
asked
dolly
peering
over
my
shoulder
as
i
bent
down
to
read
the
letters
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
why
didn
t
she
put
on
her
hat
we
touch
the
incomprehensible
it
is
said
i
a
singularly
poor
shallow
feeble
and
undesirable
little
read
it
out
said
dolly
so
i
read
it
the
silly
fellow
had
written
life
is
love
the
poets
tell
us
in
the
little
books
they
sell
us
but
pray
ma
am
what
s
of
life
the
use
if
life
be
love
for
love
s
the
deuce
dolly
began
to
laugh
gently
digging
the
pin
again
into
her
hat
i
wonder
she
said
whether
they
used
to
come
and
sit
by
this
old
dial
just
as
we
did
this
morning
i
shouldn
t
be
at
all
surprised
said
i
and
another
point
occurs
to
me
lady
oh
does
it
what
s
that
carter
do
you
think
that
anybody
measured
the
rain
gauge
dolly
looked
at
me
very
gravely
i
m
so
sorry
when
you
do
that
said
she
pathetically
i
smiled
i
really
am
said
dolly
but
you
don
t
mean
it
do
you
certainly
not
said
dolly
smiled
no
more
than
he
did
said
i
pointing
to
the
sun
dial
and
then
we
both
smiled
will
this
hour
count
carter
asked
dolly
as
she
turned
away
that
would
be
rather
strict
said
i
a
reminiscence
i
know
exactly
what
your
mother
wants
phyllis
observed
hilary
it
s
just
to
teach
them
the
ordinary
things
said
little
miss
phyllis
what
are
the
ordinary
things
i
ventured
to
ask
what
all
girls
are
taught
of
course
carter
said
hilary
i
ll
write
about
it
at
and
she
looked
at
me
as
if
she
thought
that
i
might
be
about
to
go
it
is
a
comprehensive
curriculum
i
remarked
crossing
my
legs
if
one
may
judge
from
the
results
how
old
are
your
younger
sisters
miss
phyllis
fourteen
and
sixteen
she
answered
it
is
a
pity
said
i
that
this
didn
t
happen
a
little
while
back
i
knew
a
governess
who
would
have
suited
the
place
to
a
hilary
smiled
scornfully
we
used
to
meet
i
continued
who
used
to
meet
asked
miss
phyllis
the
governess
and
myself
to
be
sure
said
i
under
the
old
apple
tree
in
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
what
house
carter
my
father
s
house
of
course
miss
phyllis
and
oh
but
that
must
be
ages
ago
cried
she
hilary
rose
cast
one
glance
at
me
and
turned
to
the
writing
table
her
pen
began
to
scratch
almost
immediately
and
under
the
apple
tree
i
pursued
we
had
many
pleasant
what
about
asked
miss
phyllis
one
thing
and
another
i
returned
the
schoolroom
windows
looked
out
that
way
a
circumstance
which
made
matters
more
comfortable
for
i
should
have
thought
began
miss
phyllis
smiling
slightly
but
keeping
an
apprehensive
eye
on
hilary
s
back
not
at
all
i
interrupted
my
sisters
saw
us
you
see
well
of
course
they
entertained
an
increased
respect
for
me
which
was
all
right
and
a
decreased
respect
for
the
governess
which
was
also
all
right
we
met
in
the
hour
allotted
to
french
lessons
by
an
undesigned
but
appropriate
i
shall
say
about
phyllis
called
hilary
from
the
writing
table
yes
cousin
mary
called
miss
phyllis
did
you
meet
often
carter
every
evening
in
the
french
hour
said
i
she
ll
have
got
over
any
nonsense
by
then
called
hilary
they
are
often
full
of
she
had
remarkably
pretty
hair
i
continued
very
soft
it
was
dear
me
i
was
just
how
old
was
she
asked
miss
phyllis
one
s
first
love
said
i
is
never
any
age
everything
went
very
well
happiness
was
impossible
i
was
heartbroken
and
the
governess
was
far
from
happy
ah
happy
happy
times
but
you
don
t
seem
to
have
been
happy
objected
miss
phyllis
then
came
a
terrible
evening
she
ought
to
be
a
person
of
active
habits
called
hilary
i
think
so
yes
cousin
mary
oh
what
happened
carter
and
an
early
riser
added
hilary
yes
cousin
mary
what
did
happen
carter
my
mother
came
in
during
the
french
hour
i
don
t
know
whether
you
have
observed
miss
phyllis
how
easy
it
is
to
slip
into
the
habit
of
entering
rooms
when
you
had
better
remain
outside
now
even
my
friend
arch
however
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
my
mother
as
i
say
came
church
of
england
of
course
phyllis
called
hilary
oh
of
course
cousin
mary
cried
little
miss
phyllis
the
sect
makes
no
difference
i
observed
well
my
sisters
like
good
girls
began
to
repeat
the
irregular
verbs
but
it
was
no
use
we
were
discovered
that
night
miss
phyllis
i
nearly
drowned
you
must
have
been
oh
how
awful
carter
that
is
to
say
i
thought
how
effective
it
would
be
if
i
drowned
myself
ah
well
it
couldn
t
last
and
the
governess
she
left
next
there
was
a
pause
miss
phyllis
looked
sad
and
thoughtful
i
smiled
pensively
and
beat
my
cane
against
my
leg
have
you
ever
seen
her
since
asked
miss
phyllis
shouldn
t
shouldn
t
you
like
to
carter
heaven
forbid
said
i
suddenly
hilary
pushed
back
her
chair
and
turned
round
to
us
well
i
declare
said
she
i
must
be
growing
stupid
here
have
i
been
writing
to
the
agency
when
i
know
of
the
very
thing
myself
the
polwheedles
governess
is
just
leaving
them
she
s
been
there
over
fifteen
years
lady
polwheedle
told
me
she
was
a
treasure
i
wonder
if
she
d
go
is
she
what
mamma
wants
my
dear
you
ll
be
most
lucky
to
get
her
i
ll
write
at
once
and
ask
her
to
come
to
lunch
tomorrow
i
met
her
there
she
s
an
admirable
hilary
wheeled
round
again
i
shook
my
head
at
miss
phyllis
poor
children
said
i
manage
a
bit
of
fun
for
them
miss
phyllis
assumed
a
staid
and
virtuous
air
they
must
be
properly
brought
up
carter
said
she
is
there
a
house
opposite
i
asked
and
miss
phyllis
blushed
hilary
advanced
holding
out
a
letter
you
may
as
well
post
this
for
me
said
she
oh
and
would
you
like
to
come
to
lunch
tomorrow
to
meet
the
paragon
no
she
ll
be
there
of
course
but
you
see
it
s
saturday
and
hilary
will
be
here
and
i
thought
you
might
take
him
off
somewhere
and
leave
phyllis
and
me
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
that
won
t
amuse
her
much
i
ventured
to
remark
she
s
not
coming
to
be
amused
said
hilary
severely
all
right
i
ll
come
said
i
taking
my
hat
here
s
the
note
for
miss
bannerman
said
hilary
that
sort
of
thing
never
surprises
me
i
looked
at
the
letter
and
read
miss
m
stood
for
maud
i
put
my
hat
back
on
the
table
what
sort
of
a
looking
person
is
this
miss
bannerman
i
asked
oh
a
spare
upright
woman
hair
a
little
gray
and
i
don
t
know
how
to
describe
it
her
face
looks
a
little
she
wears
thank
you
said
i
and
what
sort
of
a
looking
person
am
i
hilary
looked
scornful
miss
phyllis
opened
her
eyes
how
old
do
i
look
miss
phyllis
i
asked
i
don
t
know
she
said
uncomfortably
guess
said
i
sternly
oh
or
she
asked
with
a
timid
upward
glance
when
you
ve
done
your
nonsense
began
hilary
but
i
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
should
you
call
me
fat
i
asked
oh
no
not
fat
said
hilary
with
a
smile
which
she
strove
to
render
reassuring
i
am
undoubtedly
bald
i
observed
you
re
certainly
bald
said
hilary
with
regretful
candor
i
took
my
hat
and
remarked
a
man
has
a
right
to
think
of
himself
but
i
am
not
thinking
mainly
of
myself
i
shall
not
come
to
you
said
you
would
cried
hilary
indignantly
i
poised
the
letter
in
my
hand
reading
again
miss
m
aud
e
lizabeth
miss
phyllis
looked
at
me
curiously
hilary
impatiently
who
knows
said
i
that
i
may
not
be
a
romance
a
vanished
dream
a
green
memory
an
oasis
a
person
who
has
the
fortune
to
be
an
oasis
miss
phyllis
should
be
very
careful
i
will
not
come
to
do
you
mean
that
you
used
to
know
miss
bannerman
asked
hilary
in
her
pleasant
prosaic
way
it
was
a
sin
seventeen
years
old
it
would
hardly
count
against
the
blameless
miss
bannerman
now
you
may
tell
her
when
i
m
gone
said
i
to
miss
phyllis
miss
phyllis
whispered
in
hilary
s
ear
another
cried
hilary
aghast
it
was
the
very
first
said
i
defending
myself
hilary
began
to
laugh
i
smoothed
my
hat
tell
her
said
i
that
i
remembered
her
very
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
said
hilary
and
tell
her
i
continued
that
i
am
still
i
shan
t
say
a
word
about
you
said
hilary
ah
well
that
will
be
better
still
said
i
she
ll
have
forgotten
your
very
name
remarked
hilary
i
opened
the
door
but
a
thought
struck
me
i
turned
round
and
observed
i
dare
say
her
hair
s
just
as
soft
as
ever
still
i
ll
lunch
some
other
a
very
fine
day
i
see
nothing
whatever
to
laugh
at
said
hilary
coldly
when
i
had
finished
i
did
not
ask
you
to
laugh
i
observed
mildly
i
mentioned
it
merely
as
a
typical
it
s
not
typical
she
said
and
took
up
her
embroidery
but
a
moment
later
she
added
poor
boy
i
m
not
i
m
not
surprised
either
i
remarked
it
is
however
extremely
it
s
your
own
fault
why
did
you
introduce
him
a
book
i
observed
might
be
written
on
the
injustice
of
the
just
how
could
i
suppose
that
he
would
by
the
way
i
might
as
well
state
what
he
that
is
my
young
cousin
george
had
done
unless
one
is
a
genius
it
is
best
to
aim
at
being
intelligible
well
he
was
in
love
and
with
a
view
of
providing
him
with
another
house
at
which
he
might
be
likely
to
meet
the
adored
object
i
presented
him
to
my
friend
lady
mickleham
that
was
on
a
tuesday
a
fortnight
later
as
i
was
sitting
in
hyde
park
as
i
sometimes
do
george
came
up
and
took
the
chair
next
to
me
i
gave
him
a
cigarette
but
made
no
remark
george
beat
his
cane
restlessly
against
the
leg
of
his
trousers
i
ve
got
to
go
up
tomorrow
he
remarked
ah
well
oxford
is
a
delightful
town
said
i
d
d
hole
observed
george
i
was
about
to
contest
this
opinion
when
a
victoria
drove
by
a
girl
sat
in
it
side
by
side
with
a
portly
lady
george
george
i
cried
there
she
is
look
george
looked
raised
his
hat
with
sufficient
politeness
and
remarked
to
me
hang
it
one
sees
those
people
i
am
not
easily
surprised
but
i
confess
i
turned
to
george
with
an
expression
of
wonder
a
fortnight
ago
i
began
don
t
be
an
ass
sam
said
george
rather
sharply
she
s
not
a
bad
girl
but
he
broke
off
and
began
to
whistle
there
was
a
long
pause
i
lit
a
cigar
and
looked
at
the
people
i
lunched
at
the
micklehams
today
said
george
drawing
a
figure
on
the
gravel
with
his
cane
mickleham
s
not
a
bad
one
of
the
best
fellows
alive
i
agreed
i
wonder
why
she
married
him
though
mused
george
and
he
added
with
apparent
irrelevance
it
s
a
dashed
bore
going
and
then
a
smile
spread
over
his
face
a
blush
accompanied
it
and
proclaimed
george
s
sense
of
delicious
wickedness
i
turned
on
him
out
with
it
i
said
it
s
nothing
don
t
be
a
fool
said
george
where
did
you
get
that
rose
i
asked
this
rose
he
repeated
fondling
the
blossom
it
was
given
to
upon
this
i
groaned
and
i
still
consider
that
i
had
good
reason
for
my
action
it
was
the
groan
of
a
moralist
they
ve
asked
me
to
stay
at
the
towers
next
said
george
glancing
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
an
immoral
eye
perhaps
he
thought
it
too
immoral
for
he
added
it
s
all
right
i
believe
that
i
have
as
much
self
control
as
most
people
but
at
this
point
i
chuckled
what
the
deuce
are
you
laughing
at
asked
george
i
made
no
answer
and
he
went
on
you
never
told
me
what
a
what
she
was
like
sam
wanted
to
keep
it
to
yourself
you
old
george
george
george
said
i
you
go
up
tomorrow
yes
confound
it
and
term
lasts
two
months
yes
hang
it
all
is
well
said
i
crossing
my
legs
there
is
more
virtue
in
two
months
than
in
ten
george
regarded
me
with
a
dispassionate
air
you
re
an
awful
ass
sometimes
he
observed
critically
and
he
rose
from
his
seat
must
you
go
said
i
yes
got
a
lot
of
things
to
do
look
here
sam
don
t
go
and
talk
about
talk
about
what
anything
you
old
idiot
said
george
with
a
pleased
smile
and
he
dug
me
in
the
ribs
with
his
cane
and
departed
i
sat
on
admiring
the
simple
elements
which
constitute
the
happiness
of
the
young
alas
with
advancing
years
wrong
loses
half
its
flavor
to
be
improper
ceases
by
itself
to
satisfy
immersed
in
these
reflections
i
failed
to
notice
that
a
barouche
had
stopped
opposite
to
me
and
suddenly
i
found
a
footman
addressing
me
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
her
ladyship
wishes
to
speak
to
it
is
a
blessed
thing
to
be
young
martin
i
observed
yes
sir
said
martin
it
s
a
fine
day
but
very
short
said
martin
is
respectful
and
said
nothing
to
me
at
least
what
he
said
to
the
coachman
i
don
t
know
and
then
i
went
up
to
dolly
get
in
and
drive
round
suggested
dolly
i
can
t
said
i
i
have
a
bad
what
s
the
matter
with
your
nose
asked
dolly
smiling
the
joint
is
injured
said
i
getting
into
the
barouche
and
i
added
severely
i
suppose
i
d
better
sit
with
my
back
to
the
horses
oh
no
you
re
not
my
husband
said
dolly
sit
here
and
she
made
room
by
her
as
she
continued
i
rather
like
i
m
ashamed
of
you
i
observed
considering
your
age
mr
carter
considering
i
say
his
age
your
conduct
is
scandalous
i
shall
never
introduce
any
nice
boys
to
you
oh
please
do
said
dolly
clasping
her
hands
you
give
them
roses
said
i
accusingly
you
make
them
false
to
their
earliest
loves
she
was
a
thing
observed
dolly
i
frowned
dolly
by
an
accident
allowed
the
tip
of
her
finger
to
touch
my
arm
for
an
instant
he
s
a
nice
boy
said
she
how
like
he
is
to
you
carter
i
am
a
long
way
past
that
said
i
i
am
if
you
mean
to
be
disagreeable
said
she
turning
away
i
beg
your
pardon
for
touching
you
i
did
not
notice
it
lady
would
you
like
to
get
out
it
s
miles
from
my
club
said
i
discontentedly
he
s
such
fun
said
dolly
with
a
sudden
smile
he
told
archie
that
i
was
the
most
charming
woman
in
london
you
ve
never
done
that
he
said
the
same
about
the
girl
i
observed
there
was
a
pause
then
dolly
asked
how
is
your
nose
the
carriage
exercise
is
doing
it
good
said
i
if
observed
dolly
he
is
so
silly
now
what
will
he
be
at
your
age
a
wise
man
said
i
he
suggested
that
i
might
write
to
him
bubbled
dolly
now
when
dolly
bubbles
an
operation
which
includes
a
sudden
turn
towards
me
a
dancing
of
eyes
a
dart
of
a
small
hand
a
hurried
rush
of
words
checked
and
confused
by
a
speedier
gust
of
gurgling
sound
i
am
in
the
habit
of
ceasing
to
argue
the
question
bubbling
is
not
to
be
met
by
arguing
i
could
only
say
he
ll
have
forgotten
by
the
end
of
the
he
ll
remember
two
days
later
retorted
dolly
stop
the
carriage
said
i
i
shall
tell
hilary
all
about
i
won
t
stop
the
carriage
said
dolly
i
m
going
to
take
you
home
with
i
am
at
a
premium
today
i
said
sardonically
one
must
have
something
said
dolly
how
is
your
nose
now
carter
i
looked
at
dolly
i
had
better
not
have
done
that
would
afternoon
tea
hurt
it
she
inquired
anxiously
it
would
do
it
good
said
i
decisively
and
that
is
absolutely
the
whole
story
and
what
in
the
world
hilary
found
to
disapprove
of
i
don
t
know
especially
as
i
didn
t
tell
her
half
of
it
but
she
did
disapprove
however
she
looks
very
well
when
she
disapproves
the
house
opposite
we
were
talking
over
the
sad
case
of
young
algy
groom
i
was
explaining
to
hilary
exactly
what
had
happened
his
father
gave
him
said
i
a
hundred
pounds
to
keep
him
for
three
months
in
paris
while
he
learnt
and
very
liberal
too
said
hilary
it
depends
where
you
dine
said
i
however
that
question
did
not
arise
for
algy
went
to
the
grand
prix
the
day
after
he
arrived
a
horse
race
asked
hilary
with
great
contempt
certainly
the
competitors
are
horses
i
rejoined
and
there
he
most
unfortunately
lost
the
whole
sum
without
learning
any
french
to
speak
how
disgusting
exclaimed
hilary
and
little
miss
phyllis
gasped
in
horror
oh
well
said
hilary
with
much
bravery
as
it
struck
me
his
father
s
very
well
that
doesn
t
make
it
a
bit
better
declared
his
wife
there
s
no
mortal
sin
in
a
little
betting
my
dear
boys
will
be
boys
and
even
that
i
interposed
wouldn
t
matter
if
we
could
only
prevent
girls
from
being
hilary
taking
no
notice
whatever
of
me
pronounced
sentence
he
grossly
deceived
his
father
she
said
and
took
up
her
embroidery
most
of
us
have
grossly
deceived
our
parents
before
now
said
i
we
should
all
have
to
confess
to
something
of
the
i
hope
you
re
speaking
for
your
own
sex
observed
hilary
not
more
than
yours
said
i
you
used
to
meet
hilary
on
the
pier
when
your
father
wasn
t
there
you
told
me
father
had
authorized
my
acquaintance
with
i
hate
quibbles
said
i
there
was
a
pause
hilary
stitched
hilary
observed
that
the
day
was
fine
now
i
pursued
carelessly
even
miss
phyllis
here
has
been
known
to
deceive
her
oh
let
the
poor
child
alone
anyhow
said
hilary
haven
t
you
said
i
to
miss
phyllis
i
expected
an
indignant
denial
so
did
hilary
for
she
remarked
with
a
sympathetic
air
never
mind
his
folly
phyllis
haven
t
you
miss
phyllis
said
i
miss
phyllis
grew
very
red
fearing
that
i
was
causing
her
pain
i
was
about
to
observe
on
the
prospects
of
a
dissolution
when
a
shy
smile
spread
over
miss
phyllis
s
face
yes
once
said
she
with
a
timid
glance
at
hilary
who
immediately
laid
down
her
embroidery
out
with
it
i
cried
triumphantly
come
along
miss
phyllis
we
won
t
tell
honor
bright
miss
phyllis
looked
again
at
hilary
hilary
is
human
well
phyllis
dear
said
she
after
all
this
time
i
shouldn
t
think
it
my
duty
it
only
happened
last
summer
said
miss
phyllis
hilary
looked
rather
put
out
still
she
began
we
must
have
the
story
said
i
little
miss
phyllis
put
down
the
sock
she
had
been
knitting
i
was
very
naughty
she
remarked
it
was
my
last
term
at
i
know
that
age
said
i
to
hilary
my
window
looked
out
towards
the
street
you
re
sure
you
won
t
tell
well
there
was
a
house
opposite
and
a
young
man
in
it
said
i
how
did
you
know
that
asked
miss
phyllis
blushing
immensely
no
girls
school
can
keep
up
its
numbers
without
one
i
explained
well
there
was
anyhow
said
miss
phyllis
and
i
and
two
other
girls
went
to
a
course
of
lectures
at
the
town
hall
on
literature
or
something
of
that
kind
we
used
to
have
a
shilling
given
us
for
our
precisely
said
i
a
hundred
pounds
no
a
shilling
corrected
miss
phyllis
a
hundred
pounds
how
absurd
carter
well
one
day
i
i
you
re
sure
you
wish
to
go
on
phyllis
asked
hilary
you
re
afraid
hilary
said
i
severely
nonsense
carter
i
thought
phyllis
might
i
don
t
mind
going
on
said
miss
phyllis
smiling
one
day
i
i
lost
the
other
the
other
girls
are
always
easy
to
lose
i
observed
and
on
the
way
there
oh
you
know
he
went
to
the
the
young
dog
said
i
nudging
hilary
i
should
think
he
did
on
the
way
there
it
became
rather
rather
blessings
on
it
i
cried
for
little
miss
phyllis
s
demure
but
roguish
expression
delighted
me
and
he
he
found
me
in
the
what
are
you
doing
carter
cried
hilary
angrily
nothing
nothing
said
i
believe
i
had
winked
at
hilary
and
we
couldn
t
find
the
town
oh
phyllis
groaned
hilary
little
miss
phyllis
looked
alarmed
for
a
moment
then
she
smiled
but
we
found
the
confectioner
s
said
she
the
grand
prix
said
i
pointing
my
forefinger
at
hilary
he
had
no
money
at
all
said
miss
phyllis
it
s
ideal
said
i
and
and
we
had
tea
on
on
the
shilling
i
cried
in
rapture
yes
said
little
miss
phyllis
on
the
shilling
and
he
saw
me
details
please
said
i
little
miss
phyllis
shook
her
head
and
left
me
at
the
was
it
still
foggy
i
asked
yes
or
he
wouldn
t
have
now
what
did
he
come
to
the
door
carter
said
miss
phyllis
with
obvious
wariness
oh
and
it
was
such
fun
i
m
sure
it
no
i
mean
when
we
were
examined
in
the
lectures
i
bought
the
local
paper
you
know
and
read
it
up
and
i
got
top
marks
easily
and
miss
green
wrote
to
mother
to
say
how
well
i
had
it
all
ends
most
satisfactorily
i
observed
yes
didn
t
it
said
little
miss
phyllis
hilary
was
grave
again
and
you
never
told
your
mother
phyllis
she
asked
cousin
mary
said
miss
phyllis
i
rose
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
fire
little
miss
phyllis
took
up
her
sock
again
but
a
smile
still
played
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
i
wonder
said
i
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
what
happened
at
the
then
as
no
one
spoke
i
added
pooh
i
know
what
happened
at
the
i
m
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
more
said
miss
phyllis
but
i
should
like
to
hear
it
in
your
own
miss
phyllis
was
gone
she
had
suddenly
risen
and
run
from
the
room
it
did
happen
at
the
door
said
i
fancy
phyllis
mused
hilary
i
hope
said
i
that
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
i
shall
have
to
keep
my
eye
on
her
said
hilary
you
can
t
do
it
said
i
in
easy
confidence
i
had
no
fear
of
little
miss
phyllis
being
done
out
of
her
recreations
meanwhile
i
pursued
the
important
thing
is
this
my
parallel
is
obvious
and
there
s
not
the
least
likeness
said
hilary
sharply
as
a
hundred
pounds
are
to
a
shilling
so
is
the
grand
prix
to
the
young
man
opposite
i
observed
taking
my
hat
and
holding
out
my
hand
to
hilary
i
am
very
angry
with
you
she
said
you
ve
made
the
child
think
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
oh
nonsense
said
i
look
how
she
enjoyed
telling
then
not
heeding
hilary
i
launched
into
an
apostrophe
o
divine
house
opposite
i
cried
charming
house
opposite
if
only
i
might
dwell
forever
in
the
house
opposite
i
haven
t
the
least
notion
of
what
you
mean
remarked
hilary
stiffly
i
suppose
it
s
something
silly
or
i
looked
at
her
in
some
puzzle
have
you
no
longing
for
the
house
opposite
i
asked
hilary
looked
at
me
her
eyes
ceased
to
be
absolutely
blank
she
put
her
arm
through
hilary
s
and
answered
gently
i
don
t
want
the
house
ah
said
i
giving
my
hat
a
brush
but
maybe
you
remember
the
house
when
it
was
opposite
hilary
one
arm
still
in
hilary
s
gave
me
her
hand
she
blushed
and
smiled
well
said
she
it
was
your
fault
so
i
won
t
scold
no
don
t
my
dear
said
hilary
with
a
laugh
as
for
me
i
went
downstairs
and
in
absence
of
mind
bade
my
cabman
drive
to
the
house
opposite
but
i
have
never
got
there
a
quick
change
why
not
go
with
archie
i
asked
spreading
out
my
hands
it
will
be
dull
enough
anyhow
said
dolly
fretfully
besides
it
s
awfully
bourgeois
to
go
to
the
theater
with
one
s
bourgeois
i
observed
is
an
epithet
which
the
riffraff
apply
to
what
is
respectable
and
the
aristocracy
to
what
is
but
it
s
not
a
nice
thing
to
be
all
the
same
said
dolly
who
is
impervious
to
the
most
penetrating
remark
you
re
in
no
danger
of
it
i
hastened
to
assure
her
how
should
you
describe
me
then
she
asked
leaning
forward
with
a
smile
i
should
describe
you
lady
mickleham
i
replied
discreetly
as
being
a
little
lower
than
the
dolly
s
smile
was
almost
a
laugh
as
she
asked
how
much
lower
please
carter
just
by
the
depth
of
your
dimples
said
i
thoughtlessly
dolly
became
immensely
grave
i
thought
said
she
that
we
never
mentioned
them
now
did
we
ever
i
asked
innocently
i
seemed
to
remember
once
do
you
recollect
being
in
very
low
spirits
one
evening
at
monte
i
remember
being
in
very
low
water
more
than
one
evening
yes
you
told
me
you
were
terribly
there
was
an
election
in
our
division
that
year
i
remarked
and
i
remitted
percent
of
my
you
did
to
blanc
said
dolly
oh
and
you
were
very
dreary
you
said
you
d
wasted
your
life
and
your
time
and
your
oh
you
mustn
t
suppose
i
never
have
any
proper
feelings
said
i
complacently
i
think
you
were
hardly
do
be
more
and
you
said
that
your
only
chance
was
in
gaining
the
affection
of
surely
i
was
not
such
an
so
foolish
i
implored
yes
you
were
you
were
sitting
close
by
me
oh
then
it
doesn
t
count
said
i
rallying
a
little
on
a
bench
you
remember
the
bench
no
i
don
t
said
i
with
a
kind
but
firm
smile
not
the
bench
dolly
looked
at
me
then
she
asked
in
an
insinuating
tone
when
did
you
forget
it
carter
the
day
you
were
buried
i
rejoined
i
see
well
you
said
then
what
you
couldn
t
possibly
have
i
dare
say
i
often
that
they
were
that
what
were
why
the
the
what
we
re
talking
what
we
were
oh
to
be
sure
the
the
blemishes
yes
the
blemishes
you
said
they
were
the
most
oh
well
it
was
a
facon
de
i
was
afraid
you
weren
t
a
bit
sincere
said
dolly
humbly
well
judge
by
yourself
said
i
with
a
candid
air
but
i
said
nothing
cried
dolly
it
was
incomparably
the
most
artistic
thing
to
do
said
i
i
m
sometimes
afraid
you
don
t
do
me
justice
carter
remarked
dolly
with
some
pathos
i
did
not
care
to
enter
upon
that
discussion
and
a
pause
followed
then
dolly
in
a
timid
manner
asked
me
do
you
remember
the
dreadful
thing
that
happened
the
same
evening
that
chances
to
remain
in
my
memory
i
admitted
i
ve
always
thought
it
kind
of
you
never
to
speak
of
it
said
she
it
is
best
forgotten
said
i
smiling
we
should
have
said
the
same
about
anybody
protested
dolly
certainly
we
were
only
trying
to
be
smart
said
i
and
it
was
horribly
i
quite
agree
with
you
lady
besides
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
him
then
he
had
only
arrived
that
day
you
really
we
were
not
to
blame
i
urged
oh
but
doesn
t
it
seem
funny
a
strange
whirligig
no
doubt
i
mused
there
was
a
pause
then
the
faintest
of
smiles
appeared
on
dolly
s
face
he
shouldn
t
have
worn
such
clothes
she
said
as
though
in
self
defense
anybody
would
have
looked
absurd
in
it
was
all
the
clothes
i
agreed
besides
when
a
man
doesn
t
know
a
place
he
always
moons
about
and
looks
yes
rather
awkward
doesn
t
he
carter
and
the
mere
fact
of
his
looking
at
you
at
us
is
nothing
although
we
made
a
grievance
of
it
at
the
that
was
very
absurd
of
you
said
dolly
it
was
certainly
unreasonable
of
us
said
i
we
ought
have
known
he
was
a
but
we
scouted
the
idea
of
it
said
i
it
was
a
most
curious
mistake
to
make
said
dolly
o
well
it
s
put
right
now
said
i
oh
carter
do
you
remember
mamma
s
face
when
we
described
him
that
was
a
terrible
moment
said
i
with
a
shudder
i
said
he
was
ugly
whispered
dolly
and
i
said
something
worse
murmured
i
and
mamma
knew
at
once
from
our
description
that
it
was
she
saw
it
in
a
minute
said
i
and
then
you
went
well
i
rather
suppose
i
did
said
i
mamma
is
just
a
little
like
the
dowager
sometimes
said
dolly
there
is
a
touch
now
and
then
i
conceded
and
when
i
was
introduced
to
him
the
next
day
i
absolutely
i
don
t
altogether
wonder
at
that
i
observed
but
it
wasn
t
as
if
he
d
heard
what
we
were
no
but
he
d
seen
what
we
were
well
what
were
we
doing
cried
dolly
defiantly
conversing
confidentially
said
i
and
a
week
later
you
went
home
just
one
week
later
said
i
there
was
a
long
pause
well
you
ll
take
me
to
the
theater
asked
dolly
with
something
which
if
i
were
so
disposed
i
might
consider
a
sigh
i
ve
seen
the
piece
twice
said
i
how
tiresome
of
you
you
ve
seen
everything
i
ve
seen
some
things
much
oftener
i
observed
i
ll
get
a
nice
girl
for
you
to
talk
to
and
i
ll
have
a
young
i
don
t
want
my
girl
to
be
too
nice
i
observed
she
shall
be
pretty
said
dolly
generously
i
don
t
mind
if
i
do
come
with
you
said
i
what
becomes
of
archie
he
s
going
to
take
his
mother
and
his
sisters
to
the
albert
my
face
brightened
i
am
unreasonable
i
admitted
sometimes
you
are
said
dolly
i
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
have
you
ever
observed
a
small
boy
eat
a
penny
ice
of
course
i
have
said
dolly
what
does
he
do
when
he
s
finished
it
stop
i
on
the
contrary
said
i
he
licks
the
yes
he
does
said
dolly
meditatively
it
s
not
so
bad
licking
the
glass
said
dolly
stood
opposite
me
smiling
at
this
moment
archie
entered
he
had
been
working
at
his
lathe
he
is
very
fond
of
making
things
which
he
doesn
t
want
and
then
giving
them
to
people
who
have
no
use
for
them
how
are
you
old
chap
he
began
i
ve
just
finished
an
uncommon
pretty
he
stopped
paralyzed
by
a
cry
from
dolly
archie
what
in
the
world
are
you
wearing
i
turned
a
startled
gaze
upon
archie
it
s
just
an
old
suit
i
routed
out
said
he
apologetically
i
looked
at
dolly
her
eyes
were
closed
shut
and
she
gasped
my
dear
dear
boy
go
and
change
it
i
don
t
see
why
it
s
not
go
and
change
it
if
you
love
me
besought
dolly
oh
all
you
look
hideous
in
it
she
said
her
eyes
still
shut
archie
who
is
very
docile
withdrew
a
guilty
silence
reigned
for
some
moments
then
dolly
opened
her
eyes
it
was
the
suit
she
said
with
a
shudder
oh
how
it
all
came
back
to
me
i
could
wish
i
observed
taking
my
hat
that
it
would
all
come
back
to
i
wonder
if
you
mean
that
as
much
as
i
ever
did
said
i
earnestly
and
that
is
quite
how
tiresome
you
are
she
said
turning
away
with
a
smile
outside
i
met
archie
in
another
suit
a
quick
change
eh
my
boy
said
he
it
took
just
a
week
i
remarked
absently
archie
stared
a
slight
mistake
i
don
t
ask
you
for
more
than
a
guinea
said
hilary
with
a
parade
of
forbearance
it
would
be
the
same
i
replied
politely
if
you
asked
me
for
a
thousand
with
which
i
handed
her
she
held
it
in
her
open
hand
regarding
it
scornfully
yes
i
continued
taking
a
seat
i
feel
that
pecuniary
gifts
are
you
a
poor
substitute
for
personal
service
may
not
i
accompany
you
to
the
ceremony
i
dare
say
you
spent
as
much
as
this
on
wine
with
your
lunch
i
was
in
a
mad
mood
today
i
answered
apologetically
what
are
they
taught
at
the
school
above
all
to
be
good
girls
said
hilary
earnestly
what
are
you
sneering
at
carter
nothing
said
i
hastily
and
i
added
with
a
sigh
i
suppose
it
s
all
i
should
like
said
hilary
meditatively
if
i
had
not
other
duties
to
dedicate
my
life
to
the
service
of
i
should
think
twice
about
that
if
i
were
you
said
i
shaking
my
head
by
the
way
carter
i
don
t
know
if
i
ve
ever
spoken
unkindly
of
lady
mickleham
i
hope
hope
said
i
is
not
yet
if
i
have
i
m
very
sorry
she
s
been
most
kind
in
undertaking
to
give
away
the
prizes
today
there
must
be
some
good
in
oh
don
t
be
hasty
i
implored
i
always
wanted
to
think
well
of
ah
now
i
never
and
lord
mickleham
is
coming
too
he
ll
be
most
that
settles
it
i
exclaimed
i
may
not
be
an
earl
but
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
be
useful
i
ll
go
i
wonder
if
you
ll
behave
properly
said
hilary
doubtfully
i
held
out
a
three
and
a
shilling
oh
well
you
may
come
since
hilary
can
t
said
hilary
you
mean
he
won
t
i
observed
he
has
always
been
prevented
hitherto
said
she
with
dignity
so
i
went
and
it
proved
a
most
agreeable
expedition
there
were
girls
in
blue
frocks
and
white
aprons
the
girl
three
from
the
end
of
the
fifth
row
was
decidedly
pretty
a
nice
lot
of
prize
books
the
micklehams
dolly
in
demure
black
ourselves
and
the
matron
all
went
well
dolly
gave
away
the
prizes
hilary
and
archie
made
little
speeches
then
the
matron
came
to
me
i
was
sitting
modestly
at
the
back
of
the
platform
a
little
distance
behind
the
others
mr
musgrave
said
the
matron
to
me
we
re
so
glad
to
see
you
here
at
last
won
t
you
say
a
few
words
it
would
be
a
privilege
i
responded
cordially
but
unhappily
i
have
a
sore
the
matron
who
was
a
most
respectable
woman
said
dear
dear
but
did
not
press
the
point
evidently
however
she
liked
me
for
when
we
went
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
she
got
me
in
a
corner
and
began
to
tell
me
all
about
the
work
it
was
extremely
interesting
then
the
matron
observed
and
what
an
angel
musgrave
is
well
i
should
hardly
call
her
that
said
i
with
a
smile
oh
you
mustn
t
depreciate
her
you
of
all
men
cried
the
matron
with
a
somewhat
ponderous
archness
really
i
envy
you
her
constant
i
assure
you
said
i
i
see
very
little
of
i
beg
your
pardon
i
only
go
to
the
house
about
once
a
fortnight
oh
it
s
not
my
fault
she
won
t
have
me
there
what
do
you
mean
i
beg
your
pardon
perhaps
i
ve
touched
on
a
painful
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
i
suavely
it
is
very
natural
i
am
neither
young
nor
handsome
wiggins
i
am
not
the
matron
gazed
at
me
only
seeing
her
here
i
pursued
you
have
no
idea
of
what
she
is
at
home
she
has
chosen
to
forbid
me
to
come
to
her
house
her
house
it
happens
to
be
more
hers
than
mine
i
explained
to
forbid
me
i
say
more
than
once
to
come
to
her
house
no
doubt
she
had
her
nothing
could
justify
it
said
the
matron
directing
a
wondering
glance
at
hilary
do
not
let
us
blame
her
said
i
it
is
just
an
unfortunate
accident
she
is
not
as
fond
of
me
as
i
could
wish
wiggins
and
she
is
a
great
deal
fonder
than
i
could
wish
of
i
broke
off
hilary
was
walking
toward
us
i
think
she
was
pleased
to
see
me
getting
on
so
well
with
the
matron
for
she
was
smiling
pleasantly
the
matron
wore
a
bewildered
expression
i
suppose
said
hilary
that
you
ll
drive
back
with
the
micklehams
unless
you
want
me
said
i
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
matron
oh
i
don
t
want
you
said
hilary
lightly
you
won
t
be
alone
this
evening
i
asked
anxiously
hilary
stared
a
little
o
no
she
said
we
shall
have
our
usual
may
i
come
one
day
next
week
i
asked
humbly
hilary
thought
for
a
moment
i
m
so
busy
next
week
come
the
week
after
said
she
giving
me
her
hand
that
s
very
unkind
said
i
nonsense
said
hilary
and
she
added
mind
you
let
me
know
when
you
re
i
won
t
surprise
you
i
assured
her
with
a
covert
glance
at
the
matron
the
excellent
woman
was
quite
red
in
the
face
and
could
gasp
out
nothing
but
goodbye
as
hilary
affectionately
pressed
her
hand
at
this
moment
dolly
came
up
she
was
alone
where
s
archie
i
asked
he
s
run
away
he
s
got
to
meet
somebody
i
knew
you
d
see
me
home
hilary
didn
t
want
you
of
course
of
course
not
said
i
plaintively
besides
you
d
rather
come
with
me
wouldn
t
you
pursued
dolly
and
she
added
pleasantly
to
the
matron
mrs
hilary
s
so
down
on
him
you
i
d
much
rather
come
with
you
said
i
we
ll
have
a
cozy
drive
all
to
ourselves
said
dolly
without
husbands
or
wives
or
anything
horrid
isn
t
it
nice
to
get
rid
of
one
s
husband
sometimes
wiggins
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
a
widow
lady
mickleham
said
wiggins
dolly
s
eyes
rested
upon
her
with
an
interesting
expression
i
knew
that
she
was
about
to
ask
wiggins
whether
she
liked
the
condition
of
life
and
i
interposed
hastily
with
a
sigh
but
you
can
look
back
on
a
happy
marriage
wiggins
i
did
my
best
to
make
it
so
said
she
stiffly
you
are
right
said
i
even
in
the
face
of
unkindness
we
should
strive
my
husband
s
not
unkind
said
dolly
i
didn
t
mean
your
husband
said
i
what
your
poor
wife
would
do
if
she
cared
a
button
for
you
i
don
t
know
observed
dolly
if
i
had
a
wife
who
cared
for
me
i
should
be
a
better
man
said
i
solemnly
but
you
d
probably
be
very
dull
said
dolly
and
you
wouldn
t
be
allowed
to
drive
with
perhaps
it
s
all
for
the
best
said
i
brightening
up
goodbye
dolly
walked
on
wiggins
held
my
hand
for
a
moment
young
man
said
she
sternly
are
you
sure
it
s
not
your
own
fault
i
m
not
at
all
sure
wiggins
said
i
but
don
t
be
distressed
about
it
it
s
of
no
consequence
i
don
t
let
it
make
me
unhappy
goodbye
so
many
thanks
charming
girls
you
have
here
especially
that
one
in
the
fifth
i
mean
charming
all
of
them
i
hastened
to
the
carriage
wiggins
stood
and
watched
i
got
in
and
sat
down
by
dolly
oh
wiggins
said
dolly
dimpling
don
t
tell
hilary
that
archie
wasn
t
with
us
or
we
shall
get
into
and
she
added
to
me
are
you
all
right
rather
said
i
appreciatively
and
we
drove
off
leaving
wiggins
on
her
doorstep
a
fortnight
later
i
went
to
call
on
hilary
after
some
conversation
she
remarked
i
m
going
to
the
school
again
really
said
i
and
i
m
so
delighted
i
ve
persuaded
hilary
to
she
paused
and
then
added
you
really
seemed
interested
last
oh
i
would
you
like
to
come
again
tomorrow
no
i
think
not
thanks
said
i
carelessly
that
s
just
like
you
she
said
severely
you
never
do
any
real
good
because
you
never
stick
to
there
are
some
things
one
can
t
stick
to
said
i
oh
nonsense
said
hilary
but
there
are
and
i
didn
t
go
the
other
lady
by
the
merest
chance
i
observed
meditatively
i
attended
a
reception
last
i
went
to
three
said
lady
mickleham
selecting
a
sardine
sandwich
with
care
i
might
not
have
gone
i
mused
i
might
easily
not
have
i
can
t
see
what
difference
it
would
have
made
if
you
hadn
t
said
she
i
thought
three
times
about
going
it
s
a
curious
what
happened
you
may
smoke
you
i
fell
in
love
said
i
lighting
a
cigarette
lady
mickleham
placed
her
feet
on
the
fender
it
was
a
chilly
afternoon
and
turned
her
face
to
me
shielding
it
from
the
fire
with
her
handkerchief
men
of
your
age
she
remarked
have
no
business
to
be
thinking
of
such
i
was
not
thinking
of
it
said
i
i
was
thinking
of
going
home
then
i
was
introduced
to
and
you
stayed
a
little
i
suppose
i
stayed
two
hours
or
two
minutes
i
forget
which
and
i
added
nodding
my
head
at
lady
mickleham
there
was
something
irresistible
about
me
last
lady
mickleham
laughed
you
seem
very
pleased
with
yourself
she
said
reaching
for
a
fan
to
replace
the
handkerchief
yes
take
care
of
your
complexion
said
i
approvingly
she
has
a
lovely
lady
mickleham
laid
down
the
fan
i
am
very
pleased
with
myself
i
continued
she
was
delighted
with
i
suppose
you
talked
nonsense
to
i
have
not
the
least
idea
what
i
talked
to
her
it
was
quite
immaterial
the
language
of
the
eyes
oh
you
might
be
a
boy
i
was
said
i
nodding
again
there
was
a
long
silence
dolly
looked
at
me
i
looked
at
the
fire
i
did
not
however
see
the
fire
i
saw
something
quite
different
she
liked
me
very
much
i
observed
stretching
my
hands
out
toward
the
blaze
you
absurd
old
man
said
dolly
was
she
very
charming
she
was
how
clever
i
waved
my
hand
impatiently
pretty
carter
why
of
course
the
prettiest
picture
i
ever
but
that
goes
without
it
would
have
gone
better
without
saying
remarked
dolly
considering
to
have
asked
considering
what
would
have
been
the
acme
of
bad
taste
i
merely
smiled
and
waved
my
hand
again
you
re
quite
serious
about
it
aren
t
you
said
dolly
i
should
think
i
was
said
i
indignantly
not
to
be
serious
in
such
a
matter
is
to
waste
it
i
ll
come
to
the
wedding
said
dolly
there
won
t
be
a
wedding
said
i
there
are
oh
you
re
very
unlucky
that
i
observed
is
as
it
may
be
lady
were
the
reasons
at
the
reception
they
were
it
made
no
it
s
very
curious
remarked
dolly
with
a
compassionate
air
that
you
always
manage
to
admire
people
whom
somebody
else
has
it
would
be
very
curious
i
rejoined
if
somebody
had
not
married
the
people
whom
i
admire
last
night
though
i
made
nothing
of
his
sudden
removal
my
fancy
rioted
in
accidental
deaths
for
he
won
t
die
said
dolly
i
hate
that
sort
of
superstition
said
i
irritably
he
s
just
as
likely
to
die
as
any
other
man
he
certainly
won
t
die
said
dolly
well
i
know
he
won
t
do
let
it
alone
said
i
much
exasperated
it
was
probably
only
kindness
but
dolly
suddenly
turned
her
eyes
away
from
me
and
fixed
them
on
the
fire
she
took
the
fan
up
again
and
twirled
it
in
her
hand
a
queer
little
smile
bent
her
lips
i
hope
the
poor
man
won
t
die
said
dolly
in
a
low
voice
if
he
had
died
last
night
i
cried
longingly
then
with
a
regretful
shrug
of
my
shoulders
i
added
let
him
live
now
to
the
crack
of
doom
somehow
this
restored
my
good
humor
i
rose
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
fire
stretching
myself
and
sighing
luxuriously
dolly
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
laughed
at
me
do
you
expect
to
be
forgiven
she
asked
no
no
said
i
i
had
too
good
an
i
wish
i
d
been
there
at
the
reception
i
i
m
extremely
glad
you
weren
t
lady
mickleham
as
it
was
i
forgot
all
my
dolly
is
not
resentful
she
did
not
mind
the
implied
description
she
leant
back
smiling
still
i
sighed
again
smiled
at
dolly
and
took
my
hat
then
i
turned
to
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
arranged
my
necktie
and
gave
my
hair
a
touch
no
one
i
observed
can
afford
to
neglect
the
niceties
of
the
toilet
those
dainty
little
curls
on
the
forehead
you
ve
had
none
there
for
ten
years
cried
lady
mickleham
i
did
not
mean
my
forehead
said
sighing
once
again
i
held
out
my
hand
to
dolly
are
you
doing
anything
this
evening
she
asked
that
depends
on
what
i
m
asked
to
do
said
i
cautiously
well
archie
s
going
to
be
at
the
house
and
i
thought
you
might
take
me
to
the
phaetons
party
it
s
quite
a
long
drive
a
horrible
long
drive
i
stood
for
a
moment
considering
this
proposal
i
don
t
think
said
i
that
it
would
be
why
archie
suggested
it
you
re
making
an
excuse
you
know
you
are
and
lady
mickleham
looked
very
indignant
as
if
she
added
scornfully
you
cared
about
what
was
proper
i
dropped
into
a
chair
and
said
in
a
confidential
tone
i
don
t
care
a
pin
it
was
a
mere
excuse
i
don
t
want
to
you
re
very
rude
indeed
many
women
would
never
speak
to
you
they
would
said
i
all
do
just
as
you
and
what
s
that
ask
me
again
on
the
first
why
won
t
you
come
said
dolly
waiving
this
question
i
bent
forward
holding
my
hat
in
my
left
hand
and
sawing
the
air
with
my
right
forefinger
you
fail
to
allow
said
i
impressively
for
the
rejuvenescence
which
recent
events
have
produced
in
me
if
i
came
with
you
this
evening
i
should
be
quite
capable
i
paused
of
anything
dreadful
asked
dolly
of
paying
you
pronounced
attentions
said
i
gravely
that
said
dolly
with
equal
gravity
would
be
very
regrettable
it
would
be
unjust
to
me
and
very
insulting
to
her
it
would
be
the
finest
testimonial
to
her
i
cried
and
you
ll
spend
the
evening
thinking
of
her
asked
dolly
i
shall
go
through
the
evening
said
i
in
the
best
way
i
and
i
smiled
contentedly
what
s
her
husband
asked
dolly
suddenly
her
husband
i
rejoined
is
nothing
at
dolly
receiving
this
answer
looked
at
me
with
a
pathetic
air
it
s
not
quite
fair
she
observed
do
you
know
what
i
m
thinking
about
carter
certainly
i
do
lady
mickleham
you
are
thinking
that
you
would
like
to
meet
me
for
the
first
not
at
all
i
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
amusing
if
you
met
me
for
the
first
i
said
nothing
dolly
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
she
swung
the
tassel
of
the
blind
and
it
bumped
against
the
window
the
failing
sun
caught
her
ruddy
brown
hair
there
were
curls
on
her
forehead
too
it
s
a
grand
world
said
i
and
after
all
one
can
grow
old
very
you
re
not
really
old
said
dolly
with
the
fleetest
glance
at
me
a
glance
should
not
be
gradually
and
disgracefully
i
murmured
if
you
met
me
for
the
first
time
said
dolly
swinging
the
tassel
by
heaven
it
should
be
the
last
i
cried
and
i
rose
to
my
feet
dolly
let
the
tassel
go
and
made
me
a
very
pretty
curtsey
i
am
going
to
another
party
tonight
said
i
nodding
my
head
significantly
ah
said
dolly
and
i
shall
again
i
pursued
spend
my
time
with
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
shall
you
asked
dolly
smiling
i
am
a
very
fortunate
fellow
i
observed
and
as
for
hilary
she
may
say
what
she
oh
does
hilary
know
the
other
lady
i
walked
toward
the
door
there
is
said
i
laying
my
hand
on
the
door
no
other
i
shall
get
there
about
eleven
said
dolly
what
might
have
been
unfortunately
it
was
sunday
therefore
the
gardeners
could
not
be
ordered
to
shift
the
long
row
of
flower
pots
from
the
side
of
the
terrace
next
the
house
where
dolly
had
ordered
them
to
be
put
to
the
side
remote
from
the
house
where
dolly
now
wished
them
to
stand
yet
dolly
could
not
think
of
living
with
the
pots
where
they
were
till
monday
it
would
kill
her
she
said
so
archie
left
the
cool
shade
of
the
great
trees
where
dolly
sat
doing
nothing
and
nellie
phaeton
sat
splicing
the
gig
whip
and
i
lay
in
a
deck
chair
with
something
iced
beside
me
outside
the
sun
was
broiling
hot
and
poor
archie
mopped
his
brow
at
every
weary
journey
across
the
broad
terrace
it
s
a
burning
shame
dolly
said
miss
phaeton
i
wouldn
t
do
it
if
i
were
oh
yes
you
would
dear
said
dolly
the
pots
looked
atrocious
on
that
i
took
a
long
sip
from
my
glass
and
observed
in
a
meditative
tone
there
but
for
the
grace
of
woman
goes
samuel
travers
dolly
s
lazy
lids
half
lifted
miss
phaeton
mumbled
her
mouth
was
full
of
twine
what
do
you
mean
nemo
omnibus
horis
sapit
said
i
apologetically
i
don
t
know
what
that
means
nemo
everybody
i
translated
sapit
has
been
in
love
omnibus
once
horis
at
oh
and
you
mean
she
wouldn
t
have
you
asked
nellie
with
blunt
directness
not
quite
that
said
i
they
they
murmured
dolly
with
lids
they
i
pursued
regretfully
recognized
my
impossibility
hence
i
am
not
carrying
pots
across
a
broad
terrace
under
a
hot
why
did
they
think
you
impossible
asked
miss
phaeton
who
takes
much
interest
in
this
sort
of
question
a
variety
of
reasons
for
one
i
was
too
clever
for
another
too
stupid
for
others
too
good
or
too
bad
too
serious
or
too
frivolous
too
poor
or
well
no
one
objected
to
your
money
i
suppose
interrupted
nellie
pardon
me
i
was
about
to
say
or
not
rich
but
that
s
the
same
the
antithesis
is
certainly
imperfect
i
admitted
mr
gay
said
nellie
introducing
the
name
with
some
timidity
you
know
who
i
mean
the
poet
once
said
to
me
that
man
was
essentially
imperfect
until
he
was
it
is
true
i
agreed
and
woman
until
she
is
i
don
t
think
he
meant
it
quite
in
that
sense
said
nellie
rather
puzzled
i
don
t
think
he
meant
it
in
any
sense
murmured
dolly
a
little
unkindly
we
might
have
gone
on
talking
in
this
way
for
ever
so
long
had
not
archie
at
this
point
dropped
a
large
flower
pot
and
smashed
it
to
bits
he
stood
looking
at
the
bits
for
a
moment
and
then
came
towards
us
and
sank
into
a
chair
i
m
off
he
announced
and
half
are
on
one
side
and
half
on
the
other
said
dolly
regretfully
a
sudden
impulse
seized
me
i
got
up
put
on
my
straw
hat
took
off
my
coat
walked
out
into
the
sun
and
began
to
move
flower
pots
across
the
broad
terrace
i
heard
a
laugh
from
archie
a
little
cry
from
dolly
and
from
nellie
phaeton
goodness
what
s
he
doing
that
for
i
was
not
turned
from
my
purpose
the
luncheon
bell
rang
miss
phaeton
whip
and
twine
in
hand
walked
into
the
house
archie
followed
her
saying
as
he
passed
that
he
hoped
i
shouldn
t
find
it
warm
i
went
on
shifting
the
flower
pots
they
were
very
heavy
i
broke
two
but
i
went
on
presently
dolly
put
up
her
parasol
and
came
out
from
the
shade
to
watch
me
she
stood
there
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
said
well
do
you
think
you
d
like
it
carter
wait
till
i
ve
finished
said
i
waving
my
hand
another
ten
minutes
saw
the
end
of
my
task
panting
and
hot
i
sought
the
shade
and
flung
myself
onto
my
deck
chair
again
i
also
lit
a
cigarette
i
think
they
looked
better
on
the
other
side
after
all
said
dolly
meditatively
of
course
you
do
said
i
urbanely
you
needn
t
tell
me
that
perhaps
you
d
like
to
move
them
back
she
suggested
no
said
i
i
ve
done
enough
to
create
the
and
how
did
you
like
it
it
was
said
i
in
its
way
a
pleasant
enough
and
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
blew
a
ring
of
smoke
to
my
very
considerable
gratification
dolly
s
tone
manifested
some
annoyance
as
she
asked
why
do
you
say
in
its
way
because
in
spite
of
the
momentary
pleasure
i
gained
from
feeling
myself
a
married
man
i
could
not
banish
the
idea
that
we
should
not
permanently
suit
one
oh
you
thought
that
said
dolly
smiling
again
i
must
confess
it
said
i
the
fault
i
know
would
be
i
m
sure
of
that
said
dolly
but
the
fact
is
that
i
can
t
exist
in
too
high
altitudes
the
rarefaction
of
the
moral
atmosphere
please
don
t
use
all
those
long
well
then
to
put
it
plainly
said
i
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
felt
all
the
time
that
hilary
would
be
too
good
for
it
is
not
very
often
that
it
falls
to
my
humble
lot
to
startle
lady
mickleham
out
of
her
composure
but
at
this
point
she
sat
up
quite
straight
in
her
chair
her
cheek
flushed
and
her
eyelids
ceased
to
droop
in
indolent
insouciance
mrs
hilary
she
said
what
has
hilary
i
really
thought
you
understood
said
i
the
object
of
my
dolly
glanced
at
me
i
believe
that
my
expression
was
absolutely
innocent
and
i
am
of
course
sure
that
hers
expressed
mere
surprise
i
thought
she
said
after
a
pause
that
you
were
thinking
of
nellie
oh
i
see
cried
i
smiling
a
natural
mistake
to
be
she
thought
so
too
pursued
dolly
biting
her
lip
did
she
though
and
i
m
sure
she
d
be
quite
annoyed
if
she
thought
you
were
thinking
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
observed
she
didn
t
understand
what
i
was
doing
at
dolly
leant
back
the
relics
of
a
frown
still
dwelt
on
her
brow
presently
however
she
began
to
swing
her
hat
on
her
forefinger
and
she
threw
a
look
at
me
i
immediately
looked
up
toward
the
branches
above
my
head
we
might
as
well
go
in
to
lunch
said
dolly
by
all
means
i
acquiesced
with
alacrity
we
went
out
into
the
sunshine
and
came
where
the
pots
were
suddenly
dolly
said
go
back
and
sit
down
again
i
want
my
lunch
i
ventured
to
observe
do
as
i
tell
you
said
dolly
stamping
her
foot
whereat
much
intimidated
i
went
back
and
stretched
myself
once
more
on
the
deck
chair
dolly
approached
a
flower
pot
she
stooped
down
exerting
her
strength
lifted
it
and
carried
it
not
without
effort
across
the
terrace
again
she
did
the
like
i
sat
smoking
and
watching
she
lifted
a
third
pot
but
dropped
it
half
way
then
dusting
her
hands
against
one
another
she
came
back
slowly
into
the
shade
and
sat
down
i
made
no
remark
dolly
glanced
at
me
well
she
said
woman
woman
woman
said
i
sadly
must
i
carry
some
more
asked
dolly
in
a
humble
yet
protesting
tone
mrs
hilary
i
began
is
an
exceedingly
attractive
dolly
rose
with
a
sigh
where
are
you
going
i
asked
more
pots
said
dolly
standing
opposite
me
i
must
go
on
you
till
when
lady
mickleham
till
you
tell
the
truth
said
dolly
and
she
suddenly
burst
into
a
little
laugh
woman
woman
woman
said
i
again
let
s
go
in
to
i
m
going
to
carry
the
pots
said
dolly
it
s
awfully
hot
carter
and
look
at
my
poor
hands
she
held
them
out
to
me
lunch
said
i
pots
said
dolly
with
infinite
firmness
the
window
of
the
dining
room
opened
and
archie
put
his
head
out
come
along
you
two
he
called
everything
s
getting
dolly
turned
an
appealing
glance
on
me
how
obstinate
you
are
she
said
you
know
perfectly
well
i
began
to
walk
towards
the
house
i
m
going
in
to
lunch
said
i
ask
them
to
keep
some
for
me
said
dolly
and
she
turned
up
the
sleeves
of
her
gown
till
her
wrists
were
free
it
s
most
unfair
said
i
indignantly
i
don
t
care
if
it
is
said
dolly
stooping
down
to
lift
a
pot
i
watched
her
strain
to
lift
it
she
had
chosen
the
largest
and
heaviest
she
sighed
delicately
and
delicately
she
panted
she
also
looked
at
her
hands
and
held
them
up
for
me
to
see
the
lines
of
brown
on
the
pink
i
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
said
most
sulkily
as
i
turned
away
towards
the
house
all
right
it
wasn
t
hilary
dolly
rose
up
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
made
me
run
to
the
house
mr
carter
she
cried
would
stop
for
those
wretched
pots
he
s
moved
all
except
two
but
he
s
broken
three
isn
t
he
stupid
you
are
an
old
ass
carter
said
archie
i
believe
you
re
right
archie
said
i
one
way
in
i
had
a
very
curious
dream
the
other
night
in
fact
i
dreamt
that
i
was
dead
i
passed
through
a
green
baize
door
and
found
myself
in
a
small
square
room
opposite
me
was
another
door
inscribed
elysian
fields
and
in
front
of
it
at
a
large
table
with
a
raised
ledge
sat
rhadamanthus
as
i
entered
i
saw
a
graceful
figure
vanish
through
the
door
opposite
it
s
no
use
trying
to
deceive
me
i
observed
that
was
hilary
i
think
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
join
i
m
afraid
i
must
trouble
you
to
take
a
seat
for
a
few
moments
carter
said
rhadamanthus
while
i
run
over
your
little
any
formalities
which
are
usual
i
murmured
politely
as
i
sat
down
rhadamanthus
turned
over
the
leaves
of
a
large
book
carter
samuel
travers
isn
t
it
he
asked
yes
for
goodness
sake
don
t
confuse
me
with
vincent
carter
he
only
paid
five
shillings
in
the
your
case
presents
some
peculiar
features
carter
said
rhadamanthus
i
hope
i
am
not
censorious
but
well
that
fine
at
bowstreet
i
was
a
mere
boy
said
i
with
some
warmth
and
my
solicitor
grossly
mismanaged
the
well
well
said
he
soothingly
but
haven
t
you
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
at
monte
carlo
a
man
must
be
somewhere
said
rhadamanthus
scratched
his
nose
i
should
have
wasted
the
money
anyhow
i
added
i
suppose
you
would
he
conceded
but
what
of
this
caveat
lodged
by
the
dowager
lady
mickleham
that
s
rather
serious
you
know
isn
t
it
now
joking
apart
i
am
disappointed
i
remarked
to
find
a
man
of
your
experience
paying
any
attention
to
such
an
old
we
have
our
rules
he
replied
and
i
m
afraid
carter
that
until
that
caveat
is
removed
you
don
t
mean
that
really
i
m
afraid
then
i
may
as
well
go
back
said
i
taking
my
hat
at
this
moment
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
although
i
can
t
oblige
you
with
an
order
of
admission
said
rhadamanthus
very
civilly
perhaps
it
would
amuse
you
to
listen
to
a
case
or
two
there
s
no
hurry
you
know
you
ve
got
lots
of
time
before
it
will
be
an
extremely
interesting
experience
said
i
sitting
down
again
the
door
opened
and
as
i
expected
i
don
t
know
why
but
it
happens
like
that
in
dreams
dolly
mickleham
came
in
she
did
not
seem
to
see
me
she
bowed
to
rhadamanthus
smiled
and
took
a
chair
immediately
opposite
the
table
mickleham
dorothea
countess
of
she
said
formerly
i
think
dolly
foster
asked
rhadamanthus
i
don
t
see
what
that
s
got
to
do
with
it
said
dolly
the
account
runs
on
he
explained
and
began
to
consult
his
big
book
dolly
leant
back
in
her
chair
slowly
peeling
off
her
gloves
rhadamanthus
shut
the
book
with
a
bang
it
s
not
the
least
use
he
said
decisively
it
wouldn
t
be
kind
to
pretend
that
it
was
lady
dear
dear
said
dolly
what
s
the
matter
half
the
women
in
london
have
petitioned
against
have
they
really
cried
dolly
to
all
appearance
rather
delighted
what
do
they
say
rhadamanthus
is
it
in
that
book
let
me
and
she
held
out
her
hand
the
book
s
too
heavy
for
you
to
hold
said
he
i
ll
come
round
said
dolly
so
she
went
round
and
leant
over
his
shoulder
and
read
the
book
what
s
that
scent
you
ve
got
on
asked
rhadamanthus
bouquet
du
diable
said
she
i
had
never
heard
of
the
perfume
before
isn
t
it
sweet
i
haven
t
smelt
it
since
i
was
a
boy
sighed
rhadamanthus
poor
old
thing
said
dolly
i
m
not
going
to
read
all
this
you
and
with
a
somewhat
contemptuous
smile
she
walked
back
to
her
chair
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
she
added
as
she
sat
down
it
s
just
because
i
m
not
a
aren
t
you
a
fright
asked
rhadamanthus
where
are
my
spectacles
he
put
them
on
and
looked
at
dolly
i
must
go
in
you
know
said
dolly
smiling
at
rhadamanthus
my
husband
has
gone
in
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
you
d
consider
that
conclusive
said
he
with
a
touch
of
satire
in
his
tone
don
t
be
horrid
said
dolly
pouting
there
was
a
pause
rhadamanthus
examined
dolly
through
his
spectacles
this
is
a
very
painful
duty
said
he
at
last
i
have
sat
here
for
a
great
many
years
and
i
have
seldom
had
a
more
painful
it
s
very
absurd
of
you
said
dolly
i
can
t
help
it
though
said
he
do
you
really
mean
that
i
m
not
to
go
in
i
do
indeed
said
rhadamanthus
dolly
rose
she
leant
her
arms
on
the
raised
ledge
which
ran
along
the
table
and
she
leant
her
chin
on
her
hands
really
she
said
really
said
he
looking
the
other
way
a
sudden
change
came
over
dolly
s
face
her
dimples
vanished
her
eyes
grew
pathetic
and
began
to
shine
rather
than
to
sparkle
her
lip
quivered
just
a
little
you
re
very
unkind
she
said
in
an
extremely
low
tone
i
had
no
idea
you
would
be
so
rhadamanthus
seemed
very
uncomfortable
don
t
do
that
he
said
quite
sharply
fidgeting
with
the
blotting
paper
dolly
began
to
move
slowly
round
the
table
rhadamanthus
sat
still
when
she
was
standing
close
by
him
she
put
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
and
said
please
do
it
s
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
he
grumbled
dolly
s
eyes
shone
still
but
the
faintest
little
smile
began
to
play
about
her
mouth
some
day
she
said
with
total
inappropriateness
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
though
it
did
not
strike
me
so
at
the
time
you
ll
be
glad
to
remember
having
done
a
kind
thing
when
you
re
old
because
you
are
not
really
old
now
you
will
say
i
m
glad
i
didn
t
send
poor
dolly
mickleham
away
rhadamanthus
uttered
an
inarticulate
sound
half
impatience
half
i
fancy
something
else
we
are
none
of
us
perfect
i
dare
say
if
i
asked
your
wife
i
haven
t
got
a
wife
said
rhadamanthus
that
s
why
you
re
so
said
dolly
a
man
who
s
got
a
wife
is
never
hard
on
other
there
was
another
pause
then
rhadamanthus
looking
straight
at
the
blotting
paper
said
oh
well
don
t
bother
me
be
off
with
you
and
as
he
spoke
the
door
behind
him
opened
oh
you
old
dear
she
cried
and
stooping
swiftly
she
kissed
rhadamanthus
you
re
horribly
bristly
she
laughed
and
then
before
he
could
move
she
ran
through
the
door
i
rose
from
my
seat
taking
my
hat
and
stick
in
my
hand
i
felt
as
you
may
suppose
that
i
had
been
there
long
enough
when
i
moved
rhadamanthus
looked
up
and
with
an
attempt
at
unconsciousness
observed
we
will
proceed
with
your
case
now
if
you
please
i
looked
him
full
in
the
face
rhadamanthus
blushed
i
pursued
my
way
towards
the
door
stop
he
said
in
a
blustering
tone
you
can
t
go
there
you
i
smiled
significantly
isn
t
it
rather
too
late
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
asked
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
have
been
here
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
i
didn
t
know
she
was
going
to
do
it
he
protested
oh
of
course
said
i
that
will
be
your
story
mine
however
i
shall
tell
in
my
own
rhadamanthus
blushed
again
evidently
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
delicate
position
we
were
standing
thus
facing
one
another
when
the
door
began
to
open
again
and
dolly
put
her
head
out
oh
it
s
you
is
it
she
said
i
thought
i
heard
your
voice
come
along
and
help
me
to
find
this
gentleman
says
i
m
not
to
come
in
said
i
oh
what
nonsense
now
you
really
mustn
t
be
silly
rhadamanthus
or
i
shall
have
to
carter
you
weren
t
there
were
you
i
was
and
a
more
interesting
piece
of
scandal
it
has
seldom
been
hush
i
didn
t
do
anything
now
you
know
i
didn
t
carter
no
said
i
you
didn
t
but
rhadamanthus
taking
you
unawares
oh
be
off
with
you
both
of
you
cried
rhadamanthus
that
s
sensible
said
dolly
because
you
know
there
really
isn
t
any
harm
in
poor
rhadamanthus
vanished
dolly
and
i
went
inside
i
suppose
everything
will
be
very
different
here
said
dolly
and
i
think
she
sighed
whether
it
were
or
not
i
don
t
know
for
just
then
i
awoke
and
found
myself
saying
aloud
in
answer
to
the
dream
voice
and
the
dream
face
which
had
not
gone
altogether
with
the
dream
not
everything
a
speech
that
i
agree
i
ought
not
to
have
made
even
though
it
were
only
in
a
dream
