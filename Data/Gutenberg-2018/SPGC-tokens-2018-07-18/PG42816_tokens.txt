chapter
a
remarkable
acquaintance
a
new
person
is
to
me
always
a
great
event
and
hinders
me
from
sleep
emerson
you
know
how
certain
kinds
of
music
will
beat
everything
out
of
your
consciousness
except
a
wild
delirium
of
joy
how
love
of
a
woman
will
take
up
every
cranny
of
space
in
your
being
and
fill
the
universe
beside
so
that
people
who
are
not
en
rapport
with
the
strains
that
delight
you
or
with
the
beauty
that
enthralls
you
seem
pitiable
creatures
not
in
touch
with
the
divine
harmony
with
supreme
loveliness
so
it
was
with
me
when
i
set
my
feet
on
mars
my
soul
leaped
to
its
highest
altitude
and
i
had
but
one
vast
thought
i
have
triumphed
i
am
here
and
i
am
alone
earth
is
unconscious
of
the
glory
that
is
mine
i
shall
not
weary
you
with
an
account
of
my
voyage
since
you
are
more
interested
in
the
story
of
my
sojourn
on
the
red
planet
than
in
the
manner
of
my
getting
there
it
is
not
literally
red
by
the
way
that
which
makes
it
appear
so
at
this
distance
is
its
atmosphere
its
sky
which
is
of
a
soft
roseate
color
instead
of
being
blue
like
ours
it
is
as
beautiful
as
a
blush
i
will
just
say
that
the
time
consumed
in
making
the
journey
was
incredibly
brief
having
launched
my
aeroplane
on
the
current
of
attraction
which
flows
uninterruptedly
between
this
world
and
that
traveling
was
as
swift
as
thought
my
impression
is
that
my
speed
was
constantly
accelerated
until
i
neared
my
journey
end
when
the
planet
pink
envelope
interposed
its
soft
resistance
to
prevent
a
destructive
landing
i
settled
down
as
gently
as
a
dove
alights
and
the
sensation
was
the
most
ecstatic
i
have
ever
experienced
when
i
could
distinguish
trees
flowers
green
fields
streams
of
water
and
people
moving
about
in
the
streets
of
a
beautiful
city
it
was
as
if
some
hitherto
unsuspected
chambers
of
my
soul
were
flung
open
to
let
in
new
tides
of
feeling
my
coming
had
been
discovered
a
college
of
astronomers
in
an
observatory
which
stands
on
an
elevation
just
outside
the
city
had
their
great
telescope
directed
toward
the
earth
just
as
our
telescopes
were
directed
to
mars
at
that
time
and
they
saw
me
and
made
me
out
when
i
was
yet
a
great
way
off
they
were
able
to
determine
the
exact
spot
whereon
i
would
land
about
a
mile
distant
from
the
observatory
and
repaired
thither
with
all
possible
speed
and
they
have
very
perfect
means
of
locomotion
superior
even
to
our
electrical
contrivances
before
i
had
time
to
look
about
me
i
found
myself
surrounded
and
unmistakably
friendly
hands
outheld
to
welcome
me
there
were
eight
or
ten
of
the
astronomers
some
young
some
and
one
or
two
elderly
men
all
of
them
including
the
youngest
who
had
not
even
the
dawn
of
a
beard
upon
his
chin
and
the
oldest
whose
hair
was
silky
white
were
strikingly
handsome
their
features
were
extraordinarily
mobile
and
expressive
i
never
saw
a
more
lively
interest
manifest
on
mortal
countenances
than
appeared
on
theirs
as
they
bent
their
glances
upon
me
but
their
curiosity
was
tempered
by
a
dignified
courtesy
and
they
spoke
but
of
course
i
could
not
understand
their
words
though
it
was
easy
enough
to
interpret
the
tones
of
their
voices
their
manner
and
their
graceful
gestures
i
set
them
down
for
a
people
who
had
attained
to
a
high
state
of
culture
and
i
suddenly
felt
myself
growing
faint
for
although
i
had
not
fasted
long
a
journey
such
as
i
had
just
accomplished
is
exhausting
near
by
stood
a
beautiful
tree
on
which
there
was
ripe
fruit
some
one
instantly
interpreted
the
glance
i
involuntarily
directed
to
it
and
plucked
a
cluster
of
the
large
rich
berries
and
gave
them
to
me
first
putting
one
in
his
own
mouth
to
show
me
that
it
was
a
safe
experiment
while
i
ate
i
found
the
fruit
exceedingly
refreshing
the
company
conferred
together
and
presently
one
of
the
younger
men
approached
and
took
me
gently
by
the
arm
and
walked
me
away
toward
the
city
the
others
followed
us
we
had
not
to
go
farther
than
the
first
suburb
my
companion
whom
they
called
severnius
turned
into
a
beautiful
park
or
grove
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
a
superb
mansion
built
of
dazzling
white
stone
his
friends
waved
us
farewells
with
their
hands
we
responding
in
like
manner
and
proceeded
on
down
the
street
i
learned
afterwards
that
the
park
was
laid
out
with
scientific
precision
but
the
design
was
intricate
and
required
study
to
follow
the
curves
and
angles
it
seemed
to
me
then
like
an
exquisite
mood
of
nature
the
trees
were
of
rare
and
beautiful
varieties
and
the
shrubbery
of
the
choicest
the
flowers
whose
colors
could
not
declare
themselves
it
being
night
fulfilled
their
other
delightful
function
and
tinctured
the
balmy
air
with
sweet
odors
paths
were
threaded
like
white
ribbons
through
the
thick
greensward
as
we
walked
toward
the
mansion
i
stopped
suddenly
to
listen
to
a
most
musical
and
familiar
and
welcome
sound
the
plash
of
water
my
companion
divined
my
thought
we
turned
aside
and
a
few
steps
brought
us
to
a
marble
fountain
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
chaste
and
lovely
female
figure
from
whose
chiseled
fingers
a
shower
of
glittering
drops
continually
poured
severnius
took
an
alabaster
cup
from
the
base
of
the
statue
filled
it
and
offered
me
a
drink
the
water
was
sparkling
and
intensely
cold
and
had
the
suggestion
rather
than
the
fact
of
sweetness
delicious
i
exclaimed
he
understood
me
for
he
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
a
gesture
which
seemed
to
say
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
know
that
you
find
it
good
i
could
not
conceive
of
his
expressing
himself
in
any
other
than
the
politest
manner
we
proceeded
into
the
house
how
shall
i
describe
that
house
imagine
a
place
which
responds
fully
to
every
need
of
the
highest
culture
and
taste
without
burdening
the
senses
with
oppressive
luxury
and
you
have
it
in
a
word
it
was
an
ideal
house
and
home
both
outside
and
inside
white
predominated
but
here
and
there
were
bits
of
color
the
most
brilliant
like
jewels
i
found
that
i
had
never
understood
the
law
of
contrast
or
of
economy
in
art
i
knew
nothing
of
values
or
of
relationships
in
this
wonderful
realm
of
which
it
maybe
truly
said
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
i
learned
subsequently
that
all
marsians
of
taste
are
sparing
of
rich
colors
as
we
are
of
gems
though
certain
classes
indulge
in
extravagant
and
gaudy
displays
recognizing
no
law
but
that
which
permits
them
to
have
and
to
do
whatsoever
they
like
i
immediately
discovered
that
two
leading
ideas
were
carried
out
in
this
house
massiveness
and
delicacy
there
was
extreme
solidity
in
everything
which
had
a
right
to
be
solid
and
stable
as
the
walls
and
the
supporting
pillars
the
staircases
the
polished
floors
and
some
pieces
of
stationary
furniture
and
the
statuary
the
latter
not
too
abundant
each
piece
of
statuary
by
the
way
had
some
special
reason
for
being
where
it
was
either
it
served
some
practical
purpose
or
it
helped
to
carry
out
a
poetical
idea
so
that
one
was
never
taken
aback
as
by
an
incongruity
some
of
the
floors
were
of
marble
in
exquisite
and
others
were
of
wood
richly
inlaid
the
carpets
were
beautiful
but
they
were
used
sparingly
when
we
sat
down
in
a
room
a
servant
usually
brought
a
rug
or
a
cushion
for
our
feet
and
when
we
went
out
under
the
trees
they
spread
carpets
on
the
grass
and
put
pillows
on
the
rustic
seats
the
decorations
inside
the
house
were
the
most
airy
and
graceful
imaginable
the
frescoes
were
like
clouds
penetrated
by
the
rarest
tints
colors
idealized
cunningly
wrought
into
surpassingly
lovely
pictures
which
did
not
at
once
declare
the
artist
intention
but
had
to
be
studied
they
were
not
only
an
indulgence
to
the
eye
but
a
charming
occupation
for
the
thoughts
in
fact
almost
everything
about
the
place
appealed
to
the
higher
faculties
as
well
as
to
the
senses
there
comes
to
us
from
time
to
time
a
feeling
of
disenchantment
toward
almost
everything
life
has
to
offer
us
it
never
came
to
me
with
respect
to
severnius
house
it
had
for
me
an
interest
and
a
fascination
which
i
was
never
able
to
dissect
any
more
than
you
would
be
able
to
dissect
the
charm
of
the
woman
you
love
with
all
its
fine
artistic
elaborations
there
was
a
simplicity
about
it
which
made
it
possible
for
the
smallest
nature
to
measure
its
capacity
there
as
well
as
the
greatest
the
proper
sort
of
a
yardstick
for
all
uses
has
severnius
took
me
upstairs
and
placed
a
suite
of
rooms
at
my
command
and
indicated
to
me
that
he
supposed
i
needed
rest
which
i
did
sorely
but
i
could
not
lie
down
until
i
had
explored
my
territory
the
room
into
which
i
had
been
ushered
and
where
severnius
left
me
closing
the
noiseless
door
behind
him
looked
to
me
like
a
pretty
woman
boudoir
almost
everything
in
it
being
of
a
light
and
delicate
color
the
walls
were
with
a
deep
frieze
of
a
little
darker
shade
relieved
by
pale
green
and
brown
decorations
the
wood
work
was
done
in
white
enamel
paint
the
ceiling
was
sprinkled
with
silver
stars
two
or
three
exquisite
were
framed
in
silver
and
the
andirons
tongs
and
shovel
and
the
fender
round
the
and
even
the
bedstead
were
the
bed
which
stood
in
an
alcove
was
curtained
with
silk
and
had
delicacies
of
lace
also
as
fine
and
subtle
as
arachne
web
the
table
and
a
few
of
the
chairs
looked
like
our
chippendale
things
and
two
or
three
large
rugs
might
have
been
of
persian
lamb
wool
a
luxurious
couch
was
placed
across
one
corner
of
the
room
and
piled
with
down
cushions
an
immense
easy
chair
or
lounging
chair
stood
opposite
the
dressing
table
of
a
peculiarly
beautiful
wood
was
prettily
littered
with
toilet
articles
in
carved
ivory
or
silver
mountings
above
it
hung
a
large
mirror
there
was
a
set
of
shelves
for
books
and
a
porphyry
with
a
lamp
dressed
in
an
exquisite
shade
a
chiffonier
of
marquetry
the
mantel
ornaments
were
vases
of
fine
pottery
and
marble
statuettes
a
musical
instrument
lay
on
a
low
bamboo
stand
i
could
not
play
upon
it
but
the
strings
responded
sweetly
to
the
touch
a
little
investigation
revealed
a
luxurious
i
felt
the
need
of
a
bath
and
turned
on
the
water
and
plunged
in
as
i
finished
a
clock
somewhere
chimed
the
hour
of
midnight
before
lying
down
i
put
by
the
window
draperies
and
looked
out
i
was
amazed
at
the
extreme
splendor
of
the
familiar
constellations
owing
to
the
peculiarity
of
the
atmosphere
of
mars
the
night
there
is
almost
as
luminous
as
our
day
every
star
stood
out
not
a
mere
twinkling
eye
or
little
flat
silver
disk
but
a
magnificent
sphere
effulgent
and
supremely
glorious
notwithstanding
that
it
was
long
before
i
slept
i
awoke
with
the
day
i
think
its
peculiar
light
had
something
to
do
with
my
waking
i
did
not
suppose
such
light
was
possible
out
of
heaven
it
did
not
dazzle
me
however
it
simply
filled
me
and
gave
me
a
sensation
of
peculiar
buoyancy
i
had
a
singular
feeling
when
i
first
stepped
out
of
bed
that
the
floor
was
not
going
to
hold
me
it
was
as
if
i
should
presently
be
lifted
up
as
a
feather
is
lifted
by
a
slight
current
of
air
skimming
along
on
the
ground
but
i
soon
found
that
this
was
not
going
to
happen
my
feet
clung
securely
to
the
polished
wood
and
the
soft
wool
of
the
rug
at
the
bedside
i
laughed
quietly
to
myself
in
fact
i
was
in
the
humor
to
laugh
i
felt
so
happy
happiness
seemed
to
be
a
quality
of
the
air
which
at
that
hour
was
particularly
charming
in
its
freshness
and
its
pinkish
tones
i
had
made
my
ablutions
and
was
taking
up
my
trousers
to
put
them
on
when
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
severnius
appeared
with
some
soft
white
garments
such
as
he
himself
wore
thrown
over
his
arm
in
the
most
delicate
manner
possible
he
conveyed
the
wish
that
i
might
feel
disposed
to
put
them
on
i
blushed
they
seemed
such
womanish
things
he
misinterpreted
my
confusion
he
assured
me
by
every
means
in
his
power
that
i
was
entirely
welcome
to
them
that
it
would
give
him
untold
pleasure
to
provide
for
my
every
want
i
could
not
stand
out
against
such
generosity
i
reached
for
the
things
swaddling
clothes
i
called
them
and
severnius
helped
me
to
array
myself
in
them
i
happened
to
glance
into
the
mirror
and
i
did
not
recognize
myself
i
had
some
sense
of
how
a
barbarian
must
feel
in
his
first
civilized
suit
at
my
friend
suggestion
i
hung
my
own
familiar
apparel
up
in
the
closet
you
may
imagine
with
what
reluctance
but
i
may
say
right
here
that
i
grew
rapidly
to
my
new
clothes
i
soon
liked
them
there
was
something
very
graceful
in
the
cut
and
style
of
them
they
covered
and
adorned
the
body
without
disguising
it
they
left
the
limbs
and
muscles
free
and
encouraged
grace
of
pose
and
movement
the
elegant
folds
in
which
the
garments
hung
from
the
shoulders
and
the
waist
the
tassels
and
fringes
and
artistic
drapery
arrangements
while
seemingly
left
to
their
own
caprice
were
as
secure
in
their
place
as
the
plumage
of
a
bird
which
the
wind
may
ruffle
but
can
not
displace
i
suspect
that
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
skill
to
construct
a
marsian
costume
whether
for
male
or
female
they
are
not
altogether
dissimilar
the
women
stuffs
are
of
a
little
finer
quality
ordinarily
but
their
dress
is
not
usually
so
elaborately
trimmed
as
the
men
garb
which
struck
me
as
very
peculiar
both
sexes
wear
white
or
a
soft
cream
the
fabric
is
either
a
sort
of
fine
linen
or
a
mixture
of
silk
and
wool
after
severnius
and
i
came
to
understand
each
other
as
comrades
and
friends
he
laughingly
compared
my
dress
in
which
i
had
made
my
first
appearance
to
the
saddle
and
housings
of
a
horse
he
declared
that
he
and
his
friends
were
not
quite
sure
whether
i
was
a
man
or
a
beast
but
he
was
too
polite
to
give
me
the
remotest
hint
during
our
early
acquaintance
that
he
considered
my
garb
absurd
when
having
completed
my
toilet
i
indicated
to
him
that
i
was
ready
for
the
next
thing
on
the
program
which
i
sincerely
hoped
might
be
breakfast
he
approached
me
and
taking
my
hand
placed
a
gold
ring
on
my
finger
it
was
set
with
a
superb
rubellite
enhanced
with
pearls
the
stone
was
the
only
bit
of
color
in
my
entire
dress
even
my
shoes
were
of
white
canvas
i
thanked
him
as
well
as
i
was
able
for
this
especial
mark
of
favor
i
was
pleased
that
he
had
given
me
a
gem
not
only
beautiful
but
possessing
remarkable
qualities
i
held
it
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
and
turned
it
this
way
and
that
to
show
him
that
i
was
capable
of
appreciating
its
beauties
and
its
peculiar
characteristics
he
was
delighted
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
i
had
made
a
good
impression
upon
him
he
led
the
way
and
luckily
into
the
breakfast
room
we
were
served
by
men
dressed
similarly
to
ourselves
though
their
clothing
was
without
trimming
and
was
of
coarser
material
than
ours
they
moved
about
the
room
swiftly
and
noiselessly
motion
upon
that
planet
seems
so
natural
and
so
easy
there
is
very
little
inertia
to
overcome
our
meal
was
rather
odd
it
consisted
of
fruits
some
curiously
prepared
cereals
and
a
hot
palatable
drink
no
meat
after
this
light
but
entirely
satisfactory
repast
we
ascended
the
grand
stairway
a
marvel
of
beauty
in
its
elaborate
carvings
and
entered
a
lofty
apartment
occupying
a
large
part
of
the
last
i
at
first
made
out
that
it
was
a
place
devoted
to
the
fine
arts
i
had
noticed
a
somewhat
conspicuous
absence
in
the
rooms
below
of
the
sort
of
things
with
which
rich
people
in
our
country
crowd
their
houses
i
understood
now
they
were
all
marshaled
up
here
there
were
exquisitely
carved
vessels
of
all
descriptions
bronzes
marbles
royal
paintings
precious
minerals
here
also
were
the
riches
of
color
the
brilliant
morning
light
came
through
the
most
beautiful
windows
i
have
ever
seen
even
in
our
finest
cathedrals
the
large
central
stained
glasses
were
studded
round
with
prisms
that
played
extraordinary
pranks
with
the
sunbeams
which
as
they
glanced
from
them
were
splintered
into
a
thousand
scintillating
bits
as
splendid
as
jewels
we
sat
down
i
filled
i
do
not
know
why
with
a
curious
sense
of
expectancy
that
was
half
awe
across
one
end
of
the
great
room
was
stretched
a
superb
curtain
of
tapestry
a
mosaic
in
silk
and
wool
severnius
did
not
make
any
other
sign
or
gesture
to
me
except
the
one
that
bade
me
be
seated
i
watched
him
wonderingly
but
furtively
he
seemed
to
be
composing
himself
as
i
have
seen
saintly
people
compose
themselves
in
church
not
that
he
was
saintly
he
did
not
strike
me
as
being
that
kind
of
a
man
though
there
was
that
about
him
which
proclaimed
him
to
be
a
good
man
whose
friendship
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
he
folded
his
hands
loosely
in
his
lap
and
sat
motionless
his
glance
resting
serenely
on
one
of
the
great
windows
for
a
time
and
then
passing
on
to
other
objects
equally
beautiful
we
were
still
enwrapped
in
this
august
silence
when
i
became
conscious
that
somewhere
afar
off
beyond
the
tapestry
curtain
there
were
stealing
toward
us
strains
of
unusual
ineffable
music
tantalizingly
sweet
and
vague
gradually
the
almost
indistinguishable
sounds
detached
themselves
from
and
rose
above
the
pulsing
silence
or
that
unappreciable
harmony
we
call
silence
and
swelled
up
among
the
arches
that
ribbed
the
lofty
ceiling
and
rolled
and
reverberated
through
the
great
dome
above
and
came
reflected
down
to
us
in
refined
and
sublimated
undulations
our
souls
my
soul
in
this
new
wonder
and
ecstasy
i
forgot
severnius
awoke
in
responsive
raptures
inconceivably
thrilling
and
exalted
i
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
it
was
sacred
music
it
invoked
the
divine
presence
unmistakably
no
influence
that
had
ever
before
been
trained
upon
my
spiritual
senses
had
so
compelled
to
adoration
of
the
supreme
one
who
holds
and
rules
all
worlds
he
lifts
me
to
the
golden
doors
the
flashes
come
and
go
all
heaven
bursts
her
starry
floors
and
strows
her
lights
below
and
deepens
on
and
up
the
gates
roll
back
this
i
murmured
and
texts
of
our
scriptures
and
fragments
of
anthems
it
was
as
if
i
brought
my
earthly
tribute
to
lay
on
this
marsian
shrine
the
gates
did
roll
back
the
heavens
were
broken
up
new
spiritual
heights
were
shown
to
me
up
which
my
spirit
mounted
i
looked
at
severnius
his
eyes
were
closed
his
face
lighted
as
by
an
inner
illumination
and
his
whole
attitude
suggested
a
waiting
upon
god
that
intercourse
divine
which
god
permits
ordains
across
the
line
there
stole
insensibly
upon
the
air
the
hallowed
perfume
of
burning
incense
i
conjectured
and
truly
as
i
afterward
learned
that
i
was
in
my
friend
private
sanctuary
it
was
his
spiritual
lavatory
in
which
he
made
daily
ablutions
a
service
in
which
the
soul
lays
aside
the
forms
necessary
in
public
worship
and
stands
unveiled
before
its
god
it
was
a
rare
honor
he
paid
me
in
permitting
me
to
accompany
him
and
he
repeated
it
every
morning
during
my
stay
in
his
house
except
on
one
or
two
occasions
it
speedily
became
almost
a
necessity
to
me
you
know
how
it
is
when
you
have
formed
a
habit
of
exercising
your
muscles
in
a
gymnasium
if
you
leave
it
off
you
are
uncomfortable
you
have
a
feeling
that
you
have
cheated
your
body
out
of
its
right
it
was
so
with
me
when
for
any
reason
i
was
obliged
to
forego
this
higher
exercise
i
was
heavy
in
spirit
my
conscience
accused
me
of
a
wrong
to
one
of
the
selfs
in
me
for
we
have
several
selfs
i
think
there
was
not
always
music
sometimes
a
wonderful
voice
chanted
psalms
and
praises
and
recited
poems
that
troubled
the
soul
deepest
waters
at
first
i
did
not
understand
the
words
of
course
but
the
intonations
spoke
to
me
the
same
as
music
does
and
i
felt
that
i
knew
what
the
words
expressed
often
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
presence
which
hushed
our
voices
and
set
our
souls
in
tune
with
heavenly
things
no
matter
i
was
fed
and
satisfied
at
the
end
of
a
sweet
the
music
died
away
and
we
rose
and
passed
out
of
the
sacred
place
i
longed
to
question
severnius
but
was
powerless
he
led
the
way
down
into
the
library
which
was
just
off
the
wide
entrance
hall
books
were
ranged
round
the
walls
on
shelves
the
same
as
we
dispose
ours
but
they
were
all
bound
in
white
cloth
or
white
leather
the
lettering
on
the
backs
was
gold
i
took
one
in
my
hand
and
flipped
its
leaves
to
show
severnius
that
i
knew
what
a
book
was
he
was
delighted
he
asked
me
in
a
language
which
he
and
i
had
speedily
established
between
ourselves
if
i
would
not
like
to
learn
the
marsian
tongue
i
replied
that
it
was
what
i
wished
above
all
things
to
do
we
set
to
work
at
once
his
teaching
was
very
simple
and
natural
and
i
quickly
mastered
several
important
principles
after
a
little
a
servant
announced
some
visitors
and
severnius
went
out
into
the
hall
to
receive
them
he
left
the
door
open
and
i
saw
that
the
visitors
were
the
astronomers
i
had
met
the
night
before
they
asked
to
see
me
and
severnius
ushered
them
into
the
library
i
stood
up
and
shook
hands
with
each
one
as
he
advanced
and
repeated
their
own
formula
for
how
do
you
do
which
quite
amused
them
i
suppose
the
words
sounded
very
i
did
not
know
where
to
put
the
accent
they
congratulated
me
with
many
smiles
and
gesticulations
on
my
determination
to
learn
the
language
severnius
having
explained
this
fact
to
them
he
also
told
them
that
i
had
perhaps
better
be
left
to
myself
and
him
until
i
had
mastered
it
when
of
course
i
should
be
much
more
interesting
to
them
and
they
to
me
they
acquiesced
and
with
many
bows
and
waves
of
the
hand
withdrew
the
language
i
found
was
not
at
all
difficult
not
so
arbitrary
as
many
of
our
modern
languages
it
was
similar
in
form
and
construction
to
the
ancient
languages
of
southern
europe
the
proper
names
had
an
almost
familiar
sound
that
of
the
country
i
was
in
was
paleveria
the
city
was
called
thursia
and
there
was
a
river
flowing
through
it
one
portion
of
severnius
grounds
at
the
back
of
the
house
sloped
to
it
named
the
gyro
chapter
a
woman
her
face
so
fair
as
flesh
it
seemed
not
but
heavenly
portrait
of
bright
angels
hew
clear
as
the
skye
withouten
blame
or
blot
through
goodly
mixture
of
complexion
dew
and
in
her
cheeks
the
vermeil
red
did
shew
like
roses
in
a
bed
of
lillies
shed
in
her
faire
eyes
two
living
lamps
did
flame
spenser
thus
far
i
had
seen
no
women
i
was
curious
on
this
point
and
i
was
not
kept
long
in
suspense
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
my
arrival
severnius
and
i
went
out
to
walk
about
the
grounds
and
were
returning
through
an
avenue
of
eucalyptus
trees
of
a
variety
more
in
their
branches
than
any
i
have
seen
in
our
country
when
a
person
alighted
from
a
carriage
in
the
and
instead
of
entering
the
house
came
to
meet
us
it
was
a
woman
though
it
was
not
left
to
her
dress
nor
her
stature
she
was
nearly
as
tall
as
myself
to
proclaim
that
fact
her
grace
and
carriage
would
have
determined
her
sex
if
her
beautiful
face
had
not
she
advanced
swiftly
with
long
free
steps
her
white
dress
similar
in
cut
and
style
to
ours
was
relieved
only
by
a
girdle
studded
with
gems
she
carried
a
little
white
parasol
with
a
gold
fringe
and
wore
no
to
crush
down
her
beautifully
massed
hair
i
felt
myself
growing
red
under
her
lively
gaze
and
attributed
it
to
my
clothes
i
was
not
accustomed
to
them
yet
and
i
felt
as
you
would
to
appear
before
a
beautiful
woman
in
your
night
shirt
especially
if
you
fancied
you
saw
something
in
her
eyes
which
made
you
suspect
that
she
thought
you
cut
a
ludicrous
figure
of
course
that
was
my
imagination
my
apparel
in
her
eyes
must
have
been
correct
since
it
was
selected
from
among
his
best
by
my
new
friend
who
was
unmistakably
a
man
of
taste
her
face
which
was
indescribably
lovely
was
also
keenly
intelligent
that
sort
of
intelligence
which
lets
nothing
escape
which
is
as
quick
to
grasp
a
humorous
situation
as
a
sublime
truth
it
was
a
face
of
power
and
of
passion
of
i
might
say
manly
but
yet
so
soft
i
now
observed
for
the
first
time
the
effect
of
the
pinkish
atmosphere
on
the
complexion
you
have
seen
ladies
in
a
room
where
the
light
came
through
crimson
hangings
or
glass
stained
red
so
it
was
here
severnius
smiled
spoke
and
gave
her
his
hand
the
glance
they
bestowed
upon
each
other
established
their
relationship
in
my
mind
instantly
i
had
seen
that
glance
a
thousand
times
without
suspecting
it
had
ever
made
so
strong
an
impression
upon
me
that
in
a
case
like
this
i
should
accept
its
evidence
without
other
testimony
they
were
brother
and
sister
i
was
glad
of
that
for
the
reason
i
suppose
that
every
unmarried
man
is
glad
to
find
a
beautiful
woman
unmarried
there
are
seductive
possibilities
in
the
situation
severnius
did
his
best
to
introduce
us
he
called
her
elodia
i
learned
afterwards
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
that
country
have
no
perfunctory
titles
like
or
they
support
their
dignity
without
that
it
would
have
seemed
belittling
to
say
miss
elodia
i
had
a
feeling
that
she
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
me
that
she
was
half
amused
at
the
idea
of
me
a
peculiar
of
her
eyebrows
told
me
so
and
i
was
piqued
it
seemed
unfair
that
simply
because
she
could
not
account
for
me
she
should
set
me
down
as
inferior
or
impossible
or
ridiculous
whichever
was
in
her
mind
she
regarded
me
as
i
have
sometimes
regarded
foreigners
in
the
streets
of
new
york
she
indulged
her
curiosity
about
me
only
for
a
moment
asking
a
few
questions
i
inferred
and
then
passed
me
over
as
though
she
had
more
weighty
matters
in
hand
i
knew
later
on
that
she
waived
me
as
a
topic
of
conversation
when
her
brother
insisted
upon
talking
about
me
saying
half
impatiently
wait
till
he
can
talk
and
explain
himself
severnius
since
you
say
he
is
going
to
learn
our
speech
i
studied
her
with
deep
interest
as
we
walked
along
and
no
movement
or
accent
of
hers
was
lost
upon
me
once
she
raised
her
hand
her
wide
sleeve
slipped
back
and
bared
a
lovely
arm
to
break
off
a
long
leaf
from
a
bough
overhead
quicker
than
thought
i
sprang
at
the
bough
and
snapped
off
the
leaf
in
advance
of
her
and
presented
it
with
a
low
obeisance
she
drew
herself
up
with
a
look
of
indignant
surprise
but
instantly
relented
as
though
to
a
person
whose
eccentricities
for
some
reason
or
other
might
better
be
excused
she
did
not
however
take
the
leaf
it
fluttered
to
the
ground
she
was
not
like
any
other
woman
any
woman
i
had
ever
seen
before
you
could
not
accuse
her
of
hauteur
yet
she
bore
herself
like
a
royal
personage
though
with
no
suggestion
of
affecting
that
sort
of
an
air
you
had
to
take
her
as
seriously
as
you
would
the
czar
i
saw
this
in
her
brother
attitude
toward
her
there
was
none
of
that
condescension
in
his
manner
that
there
often
is
in
our
manner
toward
the
women
of
our
households
i
began
to
wonder
whether
she
might
not
be
the
queen
of
the
realm
but
she
was
not
she
was
simply
a
private
citizen
she
sat
at
the
dinner
table
with
us
and
divided
the
honors
equally
with
severnius
i
wish
i
could
give
you
an
idea
of
that
dinner
the
the
service
the
whole
thing
it
surpassed
my
finest
conceptions
of
taste
and
elegance
we
sat
down
not
merely
to
eat
though
i
was
hungry
enough
but
to
enjoy
ourselves
in
other
ways
there
was
everything
for
the
eye
to
delight
in
the
room
was
rich
in
artistic
decorations
upon
which
the
rarest
talent
must
have
been
employed
the
table
arrangements
were
superb
gold
and
silver
crystal
fine
china
embroidered
linen
flowers
and
the
food
served
in
many
courses
was
a
happy
combination
of
the
substantial
and
the
delicate
there
was
music
not
too
near
of
a
bright
and
lively
character
music
enters
largely
into
the
life
of
these
people
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
beat
time
to
almost
everything
we
did
the
conversation
carried
on
between
the
brother
and
sister
in
which
i
could
take
no
more
part
than
a
was
i
felt
sure
extremely
entertaining
if
not
important
my
eyes
served
me
well
for
one
sense
is
quick
to
assume
the
burdens
of
another
and
i
knew
that
the
talk
was
not
mere
banter
nor
was
it
simply
the
necessary
exchange
of
words
and
opinions
about
everyday
matters
which
must
take
place
in
families
periodically
concerning
fuel
and
provisions
and
servants
and
and
the
like
it
took
a
much
higher
range
the
faces
of
both
were
animated
their
eyes
beamed
brightly
upon
each
other
it
was
clear
that
the
brother
did
not
talk
down
to
her
understanding
rather
he
talked
up
to
it
or
no
they
were
on
a
level
with
each
other
the
highest
level
of
both
for
they
held
each
other
up
to
their
best
however
elodia
had
been
away
for
a
couple
of
days
i
learned
and
absence
gives
a
bloom
of
newness
which
it
is
delightful
to
brush
off
i
did
not
detect
any
of
the
quality
we
call
chivalry
in
pose
nor
of
its
complement
in
hers
though
one
would
hardly
expect
that
between
brothers
and
sisters
anywhere
still
we
have
a
way
with
our
near
women
relations
which
never
ignores
the
distinction
between
the
sexes
we
humor
them
patronize
them
tyrannize
over
them
and
they
defer
to
and
exalt
us
and
usually
acknowledge
our
superiority
it
was
not
so
with
this
pair
they
respected
and
honored
each
other
equally
and
there
was
a
charming
between
them
the
same
as
if
they
had
both
been
men
or
women
if
you
single
out
the
right
kind
they
held
widely
different
opinions
upon
many
subjects
but
they
never
crowded
them
upon
each
other
their
tastes
were
dissimilar
for
one
thing
elodia
had
not
her
brother
fine
religious
sense
she
seldom
entered
the
sanctuary
though
once
or
twice
i
saw
her
there
seated
far
apart
from
severnius
and
myself
stimulated
by
the
hope
of
some
day
being
able
to
talk
with
her
and
of
convincing
her
that
i
was
a
person
not
altogether
beneath
her
intelligence
i
devoted
myself
mind
and
soul
to
the
paleverian
language
in
six
weeks
i
could
read
and
write
it
fairly
well
severnius
was
untiring
in
his
teaching
and
every
day
strengthened
my
regard
for
him
as
a
man
he
was
an
accomplished
scholar
and
he
was
as
as
a
child
but
not
weakly
or
ignorantly
so
he
knew
evil
as
well
as
good
but
he
renounced
the
one
and
accepted
the
other
he
was
a
man
appointed
by
almighty
god
to
stand
for
a
fact
and
i
never
knew
him
to
weaken
his
position
by
defending
it
often
we
spent
hours
in
the
observatory
together
it
was
a
glorious
thing
to
me
to
watch
the
splendid
fleet
of
asteroids
sailing
between
jupiter
and
mars
and
to
single
out
the
variously
colored
moons
of
jupiter
and
to
distinguish
with
extraordinary
clearness
a
thousand
other
wonders
but
dimly
seen
from
the
earth
even
to
study
the
moons
of
mars
the
lesser
one
whirling
round
the
planet
with
such
astonishing
velocity
was
a
world
of
entertainment
to
me
i
had
begged
severnius
not
to
ask
me
to
see
any
visitors
at
all
until
i
could
acquit
myself
creditably
in
conversation
he
agreed
and
i
saw
no
one
i
believe
that
in
those
weeks
of
quiet
study
observation
and
close
companionship
of
one
noble
man
my
soul
was
cleared
of
much
dross
i
lived
with
books
severnius
and
the
stars
at
last
i
no
longer
feared
to
trust
myself
to
speak
even
to
elodia
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
her
and
evidently
a
pleasure
too
my
first
brilliant
attempt
was
at
the
dinner
table
severnius
adroitly
drew
me
into
a
conversation
about
our
world
elodia
turned
her
delightful
gaze
upon
me
so
frankly
and
approvingly
that
i
felt
myself
blushing
like
a
boy
whom
his
pretty
teacher
praises
with
her
smile
when
he
says
his
text
up
to
that
time
although
she
had
been
polite
to
me
so
entirely
polite
that
i
never
for
a
moment
felt
myself
an
intruder
in
her
home
she
apparently
took
no
great
interest
in
me
but
now
she
voluntarily
addressed
me
whenever
we
met
and
took
pains
to
draw
me
out
once
she
glanced
at
a
book
i
was
reading
a
rather
heavy
work
and
smiled
you
have
made
astonishing
progress
she
said
i
have
had
the
best
of
instructors
i
replied
ah
yes
severnius
has
great
patience
and
besides
he
likes
you
and
then
of
course
he
is
not
wholly
disinterested
he
wants
to
hear
about
your
planet
and
do
you
i
asked
foolishly
i
wanted
somehow
to
get
the
conversation
to
running
in
a
personal
channel
o
of
course
she
returned
indifferently
though
i
am
not
an
astronomer
i
should
like
to
hear
something
about
your
people
i
took
that
cue
joyfully
and
soon
we
were
on
very
sociable
terms
with
each
other
she
listened
to
my
stories
and
descriptions
with
a
most
flattering
interest
and
i
soon
found
myself
worshiping
her
as
a
goddess
yes
as
a
goddess
not
a
woman
her
entire
lack
of
coquetry
prevented
me
from
making
love
to
her
or
would
have
prevented
me
if
i
had
dared
to
have
such
a
thought
if
there
could
have
been
anything
tender
between
us
i
think
she
must
have
made
the
advances
but
this
is
foolish
i
am
merely
trying
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
kind
of
woman
she
was
but
i
know
that
i
can
not
do
that
the
quality
of
a
woman
must
be
felt
to
be
understood
there
was
a
great
deal
of
social
gayety
in
thursia
we
went
out
frequently
to
opera
to
concert
and
to
crowded
gatherings
in
splendid
homes
i
observed
that
elodia
immediately
became
the
centre
of
interest
wherever
she
appeared
she
gave
fresh
zest
to
every
amusement
or
conversation
she
seemed
to
dignify
with
her
presence
whatever
happened
to
be
going
on
and
made
it
worth
while
not
that
she
distinguished
herself
in
speech
or
act
she
had
the
effect
of
being
infinitely
greater
than
anything
she
did
or
said
and
one
was
always
looking
out
for
manifestations
of
that
she
kept
one
interest
in
her
up
to
the
highest
pitch
i
often
asked
myself
why
is
it
that
we
are
always
looking
at
her
with
a
kind
of
inquiry
in
our
glances
what
is
it
that
we
expect
her
to
do
it
was
a
great
part
of
her
charm
that
she
was
not
she
was
full
of
interest
in
all
about
her
she
was
keenly
and
delightfully
alive
her
manners
were
perfect
and
yet
she
seemed
careless
of
etiquette
and
conventions
her
good
manners
were
a
part
of
herself
as
her
regal
carriage
was
it
was
her
unvarying
habit
almost
to
spend
several
hours
down
town
every
day
i
ventured
to
ask
severnius
wherefore
he
replied
that
she
had
large
business
interests
and
looked
carefully
after
them
herself
i
expressed
astonishment
and
severnius
was
equally
surprised
at
me
i
questioned
him
and
he
explained
my
father
was
a
banker
he
said
and
very
rich
my
sister
inherited
his
gift
and
taste
for
finance
i
took
after
my
mother
family
who
were
scientists
we
were
trained
of
course
in
our
early
years
according
to
our
respective
talents
at
our
parents
death
we
inherited
their
fortune
in
equal
shares
elodia
was
prepared
to
take
up
my
father
business
where
he
left
it
in
fact
he
had
associated
her
with
himself
in
the
business
for
some
time
previous
to
his
departure
and
she
has
carried
it
on
very
successfully
ever
since
she
is
a
banker
said
i
yes
i
myself
have
always
had
a
liking
for
astronomy
and
i
have
been
employed
ever
since
i
finished
my
education
in
the
state
observatory
and
how
do
you
employ
your
capital
i
asked
elodia
manages
it
for
me
it
is
all
in
the
bank
or
in
investments
which
she
makes
i
use
my
dividends
largely
in
the
interest
of
science
the
state
does
a
great
deal
in
that
direction
but
not
enough
and
what
may
i
ask
does
she
do
with
her
surplus
your
sister
i
mean
she
must
make
a
great
deal
of
money
she
it
she
has
a
speculative
tendency
and
is
rather
daring
though
they
tell
me
she
is
very
safe
or
i
should
call
it
i
do
not
know
how
many
great
enterprises
she
is
connected
with
railroads
lines
of
steamers
mining
and
manufacturing
operations
and
besides
she
is
she
is
much
interested
in
the
cause
of
education
practical
education
for
the
poor
especially
she
is
president
of
the
school
board
here
in
the
city
and
she
is
also
a
member
of
the
city
council
a
great
many
of
our
modern
improvements
are
due
to
her
efforts
my
look
of
amazement
arrested
his
attention
why
are
you
so
surprised
he
asked
do
not
your
women
engage
in
business
well
not
to
such
an
extraordinary
degree
i
replied
we
have
women
who
work
in
various
ways
but
there
are
very
few
of
them
who
have
large
business
interests
and
they
are
not
entrusted
with
important
public
affairs
such
as
municipal
government
and
the
management
of
schools
oh
returned
severnius
with
the
note
of
one
who
does
not
quite
understand
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
is
it
because
they
are
incapable
or
unreliable
neither
of
the
words
he
chose
struck
me
pleasantly
as
applied
to
my
countrywomen
i
remembered
that
i
was
the
sole
representative
of
the
earth
on
mars
and
that
it
stood
me
in
hand
to
be
careful
about
the
sort
of
impressions
i
gave
out
it
was
as
if
i
were
on
the
stand
under
oath
facts
must
tell
the
story
not
opinions
though
personally
i
have
great
confidence
in
my
opinions
i
thought
of
our
government
departments
where
women
are
the
experts
and
of
their
almost
spotless
record
for
faithfulness
and
honesty
and
replied
they
are
both
capable
and
reliable
in
as
far
as
they
have
had
experience
but
their
chances
have
been
circumscribed
and
i
believe
they
lack
the
inclination
to
assume
grave
public
duties
i
fear
i
can
not
make
you
understand
our
women
are
so
different
so
unlike
your
sister
elodia
was
always
my
standard
of
comparison
perhaps
you
men
take
care
of
them
all
suggested
severnius
and
they
have
grown
dependent
we
have
some
such
women
here
no
i
do
not
think
it
is
that
entirely
said
i
for
in
my
city
alone
more
than
a
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
women
support
not
only
themselves
but
others
who
are
dependent
upon
them
ah
indeed
but
how
by
work
you
mean
servants
not
i
mean
intelligent
selfrespecting
women
teachers
clerks
stenographers
i
should
think
it
would
be
more
agreeable
and
easier
for
them
to
engage
in
business
as
our
women
do
no
doubt
it
would
i
replied
feeling
myself
driven
to
a
close
scrutiny
of
the
woman
question
as
we
call
it
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
for
i
saw
that
my
friend
was
deeply
interested
and
wanted
to
get
at
the
literal
truth
but
the
women
of
my
country
i
went
on
the
ones
do
not
have
control
of
money
they
have
a
horror
of
speculation
and
shrink
from
taking
risks
and
making
ventures
the
failure
of
which
would
mean
loss
or
ruin
to
others
a
woman
right
to
make
her
living
is
restricted
to
the
powers
within
herself
powers
of
brain
and
hand
she
is
a
beginner
you
know
she
has
not
yet
learned
to
make
money
by
the
labor
of
others
she
does
not
know
how
to
manipulate
those
who
are
less
intelligent
and
less
capable
than
herself
and
to
turn
their
ignorance
and
helplessness
to
her
own
account
perhaps
i
had
better
add
that
she
is
more
religious
than
man
and
is
sustained
in
this
seeming
injustice
by
something
she
calls
conscience
severnius
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
had
a
habit
of
setting
his
reason
to
work
and
searching
out
explanations
in
his
own
mind
of
things
not
easily
understood
as
a
rule
the
marsians
have
not
only
very
highly
developed
physical
faculties
such
as
sight
and
hearing
but
remarkably
acute
intellects
they
let
no
statement
pass
without
examination
and
they
scrutinize
facts
closely
and
seek
for
causes
if
so
many
women
said
he
are
obliged
to
support
themselves
and
others
beside
as
you
say
by
their
work
simply
they
must
receive
princely
wages
and
of
course
they
have
no
responsibilities
which
is
a
great
saving
of
energy
i
remembered
having
heard
it
stated
that
in
new
york
city
the
united
states
bureau
gives
the
average
of
women
wages
leaving
out
domestic
service
and
unskilled
labor
as
five
dollars
and
cents
per
week
i
mentioned
the
fact
and
severnius
looked
aghast
what
a
mere
pittance
said
he
only
about
a
third
as
much
as
i
give
my
stableman
but
then
the
conditions
are
different
no
doubt
here
in
thursia
that
would
no
more
than
fight
off
the
wolf
as
we
say
the
hunger
and
cold
it
would
afford
no
taste
of
the
better
things
freedom
leisure
recreation
but
would
reduce
life
to
its
lowest
terms
mere
existence
i
fear
the
conditions
are
much
the
same
with
us
i
replied
and
do
your
women
submit
to
such
conditions
do
they
not
try
to
alter
them
throw
them
off
they
submit
of
course
i
said
i
never
heard
of
a
revolt
or
an
insurrection
among
them
though
there
seems
to
be
growing
up
among
them
lately
a
determination
strong
as
death
to
work
out
of
those
conditions
as
fast
as
may
be
they
realize
just
as
men
have
been
forced
to
realize
in
this
century
that
work
of
the
hands
can
not
compete
with
work
of
machines
and
that
trained
brains
are
better
capital
than
trained
fingers
so
slowly
but
surely
they
are
reaching
up
to
the
higher
callings
and
working
into
places
of
honor
and
trust
the
odds
are
against
them
because
the
always
have
a
tremendous
advantage
over
the
the
women
having
never
been
in
must
submit
to
a
rigid
examination
and
extraordinary
tests
they
know
that
and
they
are
rising
to
it
whenever
it
is
said
they
come
into
competition
with
men
in
our
colleges
and
training
schools
they
hold
their
own
and
more
what
are
they
fitting
for
asked
severnius
largely
for
the
professions
they
are
becoming
doctors
lawyers
editors
artists
writers
the
enormous
systems
of
public
schools
in
my
own
and
other
countries
is
entirely
in
their
hands
except
of
course
in
the
management
and
directorship
except
in
the
management
and
directorship
echoed
severnius
of
course
they
do
not
provide
and
disburse
the
funds
see
to
the
building
of
and
dictate
the
policy
of
the
schools
i
retorted
but
they
teach
them
you
can
hardly
find
a
male
teacher
except
at
the
head
of
a
school
to
keep
the
faculty
in
order
severnius
refrained
from
comment
upon
this
seeing
i
suppose
that
i
was
getting
a
little
impatient
he
walked
along
with
his
head
down
i
think
i
neglected
to
say
that
we
were
taking
a
long
tramp
into
the
country
as
we
often
did
in
order
to
change
the
conversation
i
asked
him
what
sort
of
a
government
they
had
in
paleveria
and
was
delighted
when
he
replied
that
it
was
a
free
republic
my
country
is
a
republic
also
i
said
proudly
we
both
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
he
answered
a
republic
is
the
only
natural
government
in
the
world
and
man
can
not
get
above
nature
i
thought
this
remark
rather
singular
at
variance
with
progress
and
high
civilization
but
i
let
it
pass
thinking
to
take
it
up
at
some
future
time
how
do
you
vote
here
i
asked
what
are
your
qualifications
and
restrictions
briefly
told
he
replied
every
citizen
may
vote
on
all
public
questions
and
in
all
elections
but
what
constitutes
citizenship
a
is
a
citizen
when
he
or
she
reaches
maturity
foreigners
are
treated
as
minors
until
they
have
lived
as
long
under
the
government
as
it
takes
for
a
child
to
come
of
age
it
is
thus
he
added
facetiously
that
we
punish
people
for
presuming
to
be
born
outside
our
happy
country
excuse
me
i
said
but
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
your
women
have
the
right
of
suffrage
assuredly
do
not
yours
indeed
no
i
replied
the
masculine
instinct
of
superiority
swelling
within
me
severnius
wears
spectacles
he
adjusted
them
carefully
on
his
nose
and
looked
at
me
but
did
you
not
tell
me
just
now
that
your
country
is
a
republic
it
is
but
we
do
not
hold
that
women
are
our
political
equals
i
answered
his
face
was
an
exclamation
and
interrogation
point
fused
into
one
indeed
and
how
do
you
manage
it
how
for
instance
can
you
prevent
them
from
voting
o
they
do
often
try
it
i
said
laughing
when
they
do
we
simply
throw
their
ballots
out
of
the
count
is
it
possible
that
seems
to
me
a
great
unfairness
however
it
can
be
accounted
for
i
suppose
from
the
fact
that
things
are
so
different
on
the
earth
to
what
they
are
here
our
government
you
see
rests
upon
a
system
of
taxation
we
tax
all
property
to
defray
governmental
expenses
and
for
many
other
purposes
tending
toward
the
general
good
which
makes
it
necessary
that
all
our
citizens
shall
have
a
voice
in
our
political
economy
but
you
say
your
women
have
no
property
and
so
i
beg
your
pardon
i
interposed
i
did
not
say
that
we
have
a
great
many
very
rich
women
women
whose
husbands
or
fathers
have
left
them
fortunes
then
they
of
course
have
a
vote
they
do
not
you
ca
make
a
distinction
like
that
no
but
you
exempt
their
property
perhaps
of
course
not
do
you
tell
me
that
you
tax
property
to
whatever
amount
and
for
whatever
purpose
you
choose
without
allowing
the
owner
her
fractional
right
to
decide
about
either
the
one
or
the
other
their
interests
are
identical
with
ours
i
replied
so
what
is
the
difference
we
men
manage
the
government
business
and
i
fancy
we
do
it
sufficiently
well
i
expanded
my
chest
after
this
remark
and
severnius
simply
looked
at
me
i
think
that
at
that
moment
i
suffered
vicariously
in
his
scornful
regard
for
all
my
countrymen
i
did
not
like
the
socratic
method
he
had
adopted
in
this
conversation
and
i
turned
the
tables
on
him
do
your
women
hold
office
other
than
in
the
school
board
and
the
council
i
asked
o
yes
fully
half
our
offices
are
filled
by
women
and
you
make
no
discrimination
in
the
kind
of
office
the
law
makes
none
those
things
adjust
themselves
fitness
equipment
are
the
only
things
considered
a
woman
the
same
as
a
man
is
governed
by
her
taste
and
inclination
in
the
matter
of
do
women
never
take
a
hand
in
state
affairs
on
the
earth
yes
in
some
countries
they
do
monarchies
there
have
been
a
good
many
women
sovereigns
there
are
a
few
now
and
are
they
successful
rulers
some
are
some
are
not
the
same
as
men
that
proves
that
your
women
are
not
really
inferior
well
i
should
say
not
i
retorted
our
women
are
very
superior
we
treat
them
more
as
princesses
than
as
inferiors
they
are
angels
i
was
carried
away
in
the
heat
of
resentment
and
knew
that
what
i
had
said
was
half
cant
i
beg
your
pardon
said
severnius
quickly
i
got
a
wrong
impression
from
your
statements
i
fear
i
am
very
stupid
are
they
all
angels
i
gave
him
a
furtive
glance
and
saw
that
he
was
in
earnest
his
brows
were
drawn
together
with
a
puzzled
look
i
had
a
sudden
vision
of
a
scene
in
five
points
several
groups
of
frowsled
petticoated
beings
laughing
joking
swearing
quarreling
fighting
and
drinking
beer
from
dirty
mugs
no
not
all
of
them
i
replied
smiling
that
was
a
figure
of
speech
there
are
so
many
classes
let
us
confine
our
discussion
to
one
then
he
returned
to
the
women
who
might
be
of
your
own
family
that
will
simplify
matters
and
now
tell
me
please
how
this
state
of
things
came
about
this
subjection
of
a
part
of
your
people
i
can
not
understand
it
these
subjects
being
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
i
should
think
it
would
breed
domestic
discontent
where
some
of
the
members
of
a
family
wield
a
power
and
enjoy
a
privilege
denied
to
the
others
fancy
my
shaking
a
ballot
over
elodia
head
o
elodia
i
said
and
was
immediately
conscious
that
my
accent
was
traitorous
to
my
countrywomen
i
made
haste
to
add
your
sister
is
incomparable
she
is
unusual
even
here
i
have
seen
none
others
like
her
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
she
is
as
responsible
as
a
man
she
is
not
inconsequent
are
your
women
inconsequent
they
have
been
called
so
and
we
think
it
rather
adds
to
their
attractiveness
you
see
they
have
always
been
relieved
of
responsibility
and
i
assure
you
the
large
majority
of
them
have
no
desire
to
assume
it
i
mean
in
the
matter
of
government
and
politics
yes
i
dislike
an
interrogative
yes
and
i
made
no
reply
severnius
added
i
suppose
they
have
lost
the
faculty
which
you
say
they
lack
the
faculty
that
makes
people
responsible
through
disuse
i
have
seen
the
same
thing
in
countries
on
the
other
side
of
our
globe
where
races
have
been
held
as
slaves
for
several
centuries
they
seem
to
have
no
ideas
about
personal
rights
or
liberties
as
pertaining
to
themselves
and
no
inclination
in
that
direction
it
always
struck
me
as
being
the
most
pathetic
feature
of
their
condition
that
they
and
everybody
else
accepted
it
as
a
matter
of
course
as
they
would
a
law
of
nature
in
the
place
of
strength
and
there
has
come
to
them
a
dumb
patience
or
an
unquestioning
acquiescence
like
that
of
people
born
blind
are
your
women
happy
you
should
see
them
i
exclaimed
with
certain
memories
rushing
upon
me
and
visions
of
fair
faces
radiant
with
the
joy
of
living
but
these
were
quickly
followed
by
other
pictures
and
i
felt
bound
to
add
of
late
a
restless
spirit
has
developed
in
certain
circles
the
working
circles
i
suppose
interrupted
severnius
you
spoke
of
the
working
women
getting
into
the
professions
not
those
exclusively
even
the
women
of
leisure
are
not
so
satisfied
as
they
used
to
be
there
has
been
for
a
great
many
years
more
or
less
chaffing
about
women
rights
but
now
they
are
beginning
to
take
the
matter
seriously
ah
they
are
waking
up
perhaps
yes
some
of
them
are
waking
up
a
good
many
of
them
it
is
a
little
ridiculous
when
one
thinks
of
it
seeing
they
have
no
power
to
enforce
their
and
can
never
attain
them
except
through
the
condescension
of
men
tell
me
severnius
when
did
your
women
wake
up
severnius
smiled
my
dear
sir
i
think
they
have
never
been
asleep
we
stalked
along
silently
for
a
time
the
subject
passed
out
of
my
mind
or
was
driven
out
by
the
beauties
of
the
landscape
about
us
i
was
especially
impressed
with
the
magnificence
of
the
trees
that
hedged
every
little
patch
of
farm
land
and
threw
their
protecting
arms
around
houses
and
cottages
big
and
little
and
with
the
many
pellucid
streams
flowing
naturally
or
divided
like
strands
of
silk
and
guided
in
new
courses
to
lave
the
roots
of
trees
or
run
through
pasture
lands
where
herds
were
feeding
a
tree
is
something
to
be
proud
of
in
paleveria
more
than
a
fine
residence
more
even
than
ancient
furniture
and
cracked
china
perhaps
because
the
people
sit
out
under
their
trees
a
great
deal
and
the
shade
of
them
has
protected
the
heads
of
many
generations
and
they
have
become
hallowed
through
sacred
memories
and
traditions
in
paleveria
they
have
tree
doctors
whose
business
it
is
to
ward
off
disease
heal
wounded
or
broken
boughs
and
exterminate
destructive
insects
severnius
startled
me
suddenly
with
another
question
what
may
i
ask
is
your
theory
of
man
creation
god
made
man
and
from
one
of
his
ribs
fashioned
woman
i
replied
catechetically
ours
is
different
said
he
it
is
this
a
pair
of
creatures
male
and
female
sprang
simultaneously
from
an
enchanted
lake
in
the
mountain
region
of
a
country
called
caskia
in
the
northern
part
of
this
continent
they
were
only
animals
but
they
were
beautiful
and
innocent
god
breathed
a
soul
into
them
and
they
were
man
and
woman
equals
in
all
things
a
charming
legend
said
i
later
on
i
learned
the
full
breadth
of
the
meaning
of
the
equality
he
spoke
of
at
that
time
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
comprehend
it
and
i
can
only
convey
it
to
you
in
a
complete
account
of
my
further
experiences
on
that
wonderful
planet
chapter
the
auroras
annual
it
was
winter
and
snow
was
on
the
ground
white
and
sparkling
and
as
light
as
elodia
kept
a
fine
stable
four
magnificent
white
horses
were
harnessed
to
her
sleigh
which
was
in
the
form
of
an
immense
swan
with
a
head
and
neck
of
frosted
silver
the
body
of
it
was
padded
outside
with
white
varnished
leather
and
inside
with
velvet
of
the
color
of
a
dove
breast
the
robes
were
enormous
skins
of
polar
bears
lined
with
a
soft
warm
fabric
of
wool
and
silk
the
harness
was
bestrung
with
little
silver
bells
of
most
musical
and
merry
tone
and
all
the
trappings
and
accoutrements
were
superb
elodia
had
luxurious
tastes
and
indulged
them
every
day
we
took
an
exhilarating
drive
the
two
deep
comfortable
seats
faced
each
other
like
seats
in
a
landau
severnius
and
i
occupied
one
and
elodia
the
other
so
that
i
had
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
her
whenever
i
chose
and
of
meeting
her
eyes
in
conversation
now
and
then
which
was
no
small
part
of
my
enjoyment
the
mere
sight
of
her
roused
the
imagination
and
quickened
the
pulse
her
eyes
were
unusually
dark
but
they
had
blue
rays
and
were
as
clear
and
beautiful
as
agates
held
under
water
in
fact
they
seemed
to
swim
in
an
invisible
liquid
her
complexion
had
the
effect
of
alabaster
through
which
a
pink
light
shines
deepest
in
the
cheeks
as
though
they
were
more
transparent
than
the
rest
of
her
face
her
head
crowned
with
a
fascinating
little
cap
rose
above
her
soft
furs
like
a
regal
flower
she
was
so
beautiful
that
i
wondered
at
myself
that
i
could
bear
the
sight
of
her
strange
to
say
the
weather
was
not
cold
it
was
simply
bracing
hardly
severe
enough
to
make
the
ears
tingle
the
roads
were
perfect
everywhere
and
we
often
drove
into
the
country
the
horses
flew
over
the
wide
white
stretches
at
an
incredible
speed
one
afternoon
when
at
the
usual
hour
the
coachman
rang
the
bell
and
announced
that
he
was
ready
i
was
greatly
disappointed
to
find
that
we
were
not
to
have
elodia
but
i
said
nothing
for
i
was
shy
about
mentioning
her
name
when
we
were
seated
severnius
gave
directions
to
the
driver
time
yourself
giddo
so
that
you
will
be
at
the
public
square
at
precisely
three
said
he
and
turned
to
me
we
shall
want
to
see
the
parade
what
parade
i
inquired
oh
has
not
elodia
told
you
this
is
the
auroras
annual
a
great
day
the
parade
will
be
worth
seeing
in
the
excitement
of
the
drive
and
in
my
disappointment
about
not
having
elodia
with
us
i
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
annual
when
three
came
i
had
seen
parades
in
new
york
city
until
the
spectacle
had
calloused
my
sense
of
the
magnificent
and
i
very
much
doubted
whether
mars
had
anything
new
to
offer
me
in
that
line
punctual
to
the
minute
giddo
fetched
up
at
the
square
among
a
thousand
or
so
of
other
turnouts
with
such
a
flourish
as
all
jehus
love
we
were
not
a
second
too
soon
there
was
a
sudden
burst
of
music
infinitely
mellowed
by
distance
and
as
far
up
the
street
as
the
eye
could
well
reach
there
appeared
a
mounted
procession
advancing
slowly
every
charger
was
snow
white
with
crimped
mane
and
tail
long
and
flowing
and
with
trappings
of
various
colors
magnificent
in
silver
blazonry
the
musicians
only
were
on
foot
they
were
beating
upon
drums
and
blowing
transcendent
airs
through
silver
wind
instruments
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
some
quality
of
the
atmosphere
that
made
the
strains
so
ravishing
but
they
swept
over
one
soul
with
a
rapture
that
was
almost
painful
i
could
hardly
sit
still
but
i
was
held
down
by
the
thought
that
if
i
should
get
up
i
would
not
know
what
to
do
it
is
a
peculiar
sensation
on
came
the
resplendent
column
with
slow
majestic
movement
and
i
unconsciously
kept
time
with
the
drums
with
browning
stately
lines
on
my
tongue
but
unspoken
steady
they
step
adown
the
slope
steady
they
climb
the
hill
there
was
no
hill
but
a
very
slight
descent
as
they
drew
nearer
the
splendor
of
the
various
uniforms
dazzled
my
eyes
you
will
remember
that
everything
about
us
was
white
the
buildings
all
of
white
stone
or
brick
the
ground
covered
with
snow
and
the
crowds
of
people
lining
the
streets
all
dressed
in
the
national
color
or
there
were
several
companies
in
the
procession
and
each
company
wore
distinguishing
badges
and
carried
flags
and
banners
peculiar
to
itself
the
housings
on
the
horses
of
the
first
brigade
were
of
yellow
and
all
the
decorations
of
the
riders
corresponded
of
the
second
pale
blue
and
of
the
third
the
uniforms
of
the
riders
were
inconceivably
splendid
fantastic
and
gorgeous
glittering
belts
silken
scarfs
and
sashes
badges
and
medals
flashing
with
gems
and
brilliant
colors
twisted
into
strange
and
curious
devices
as
the
first
division
was
about
to
pass
i
lost
my
grip
on
myself
and
half
started
to
my
feet
with
a
smothered
exclamation
elodia
severnius
put
out
his
hand
as
though
he
were
afraid
i
was
going
to
leap
out
of
the
sleigh
or
do
something
unusual
what
is
it
he
cried
and
following
my
gaze
he
added
yes
that
is
elodia
in
front
she
is
the
supreme
sorceress
of
the
order
of
the
auroras
the
do
be
frightened
he
laughed
the
word
means
nothing
it
is
only
a
title
i
could
not
believe
him
when
i
looked
at
the
advancing
figure
of
elodia
she
sat
her
horse
splendidly
erect
her
fair
head
was
crowned
with
a
superb
diadem
of
gold
and
topazes
with
a
diamond
star
in
the
centre
shooting
rays
like
the
sun
her
expression
was
grave
and
lofty
she
glanced
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
gazed
straight
ahead
at
nothing
or
at
something
infinitely
beyond
mortal
vision
her
horse
champed
its
bits
arched
its
beautiful
neck
and
stepped
with
conscious
pride
dangling
the
gold
fringe
on
its
sheeny
yellow
satin
until
one
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
the
words
mean
nothing
i
repeated
to
myself
it
is
not
so
severnius
has
deceived
me
his
sister
is
a
sorceress
a
i
do
know
what
but
no
woman
could
preserve
that
majestic
mien
that
proud
solemnity
of
countenance
if
she
were
simply
playing
there
is
a
mystery
here
i
scrutinized
every
rider
as
they
passed
there
was
not
a
man
among
them
all
women
their
faces
had
all
borrowed
or
had
tried
to
borrow
elodia
queenly
look
many
of
them
only
burlesqued
it
none
were
as
beautiful
as
she
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
music
had
died
away
in
the
distance
we
drove
off
giddo
threading
his
way
with
consummate
skill
which
redounded
much
to
his
glory
in
certain
circles
he
cared
for
through
the
crowded
thoroughfares
i
could
not
speak
for
many
minutes
and
severnius
was
a
man
upon
whom
silence
always
fell
at
the
right
time
i
never
knew
him
to
break
in
upon
another
mood
for
his
own
entertainment
nor
did
he
spy
upon
your
thoughts
he
left
you
free
i
appealed
to
him
tell
me
severnius
what
does
it
mean
this
celebration
returned
he
with
pleasure
giddo
you
may
drive
round
for
half
an
hour
and
then
take
us
to
the
auroras
temple
it
is
open
to
visitors
we
drew
the
robes
closely
and
settled
ourselves
more
comfortably
as
we
cleared
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
it
was
growing
late
and
the
air
was
filled
with
fine
arrows
of
frost
touched
by
the
last
sunbeams
their
sharp
little
points
stinging
our
faces
as
we
were
borne
along
at
our
usual
lively
speed
this
society
of
the
auroras
said
severnius
originated
several
centuries
ago
in
the
time
of
a
great
famine
in
those
days
the
people
were
poor
and
improvident
and
a
single
failure
in
their
crops
left
them
in
a
sorry
condition
some
of
the
wealthiest
women
of
the
country
banded
themselves
together
and
worked
systematically
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
their
faces
appeared
so
beautiful
and
beamed
with
such
a
light
of
salvation
as
they
went
about
from
hut
to
hut
that
they
got
the
name
of
among
the
simple
poor
and
they
banished
want
and
hunger
so
magically
that
they
were
also
called
o
then
it
is
a
charitable
organization
i
exclaimed
much
relieved
it
was
replied
severnius
it
was
in
active
operation
for
a
hundred
or
so
years
finally
when
there
was
no
more
need
of
it
the
state
having
undertaken
the
care
of
its
poor
it
passed
into
a
sentiment
such
as
you
have
seen
a
very
costly
and
elaborate
sentiment
i
retorted
yes
and
it
is
growing
more
so
all
the
time
said
he
i
sometimes
wonder
where
it
is
going
to
stop
for
those
who
like
elodia
have
plenty
of
money
it
does
not
matter
but
some
of
the
women
we
saw
in
those
costly
robes
and
ornaments
can
ill
afford
them
they
mean
less
of
comfort
in
their
homes
and
less
of
culture
to
their
children
i
should
think
their
husbands
would
not
allow
such
a
waste
of
money
i
said
forgetting
the
social
economy
of
mars
it
does
not
cost
any
more
than
membership
in
the
orders
to
which
the
husbands
themselves
belong
returned
he
they
argue
of
course
that
they
need
the
recreation
and
also
that
membership
in
such
hightoned
clubs
gives
them
and
their
children
a
better
standing
and
greater
influence
in
society
severnius
did
not
forget
his
usual
corollary
the
question
with
which
he
topped
out
every
explanation
he
made
about
his
country
and
people
have
you
nothing
of
the
sort
on
the
earth
he
asked
among
the
women
we
have
not
i
answered
i
did
not
specify
he
said
o
well
the
men
have
i
admitted
i
belong
to
one
such
organization
myself
the
city
guards
and
you
guard
the
city
no
there
is
nothing
to
guard
it
against
at
present
it
a
as
you
say
and
do
you
parade
yes
of
course
upon
occasion
there
are
certain
great
anniversaries
in
our
nation
history
when
we
appear
and
why
not
your
women
i
smiled
to
myself
as
i
tried
to
fancy
some
of
the
new
york
ladies
i
knew
arrayed
in
gorgeous
habiliments
for
an
equestrian
exhibition
on
broadway
i
replied
really
severnius
the
idea
is
entirely
new
to
me
i
think
they
would
regard
it
as
highly
absurd
do
they
regard
you
as
absurd
he
asked
in
that
way
of
his
which
i
was
often
in
doubt
about
not
knowing
whether
he
was
in
earnest
or
not
i
sure
i
do
not
know
i
said
they
may
our
women
have
a
keen
relish
for
the
ludicrous
still
i
can
not
think
that
they
do
they
appear
to
look
upon
us
with
pride
and
they
present
us
with
an
elaborate
silken
banner
about
once
a
year
stitched
together
by
their
own
fair
fingers
and
paid
for
out
of
their
own
pocket
money
that
does
not
look
as
though
they
were
laughing
at
us
exactly
i
said
this
as
much
to
convince
myself
as
severnius
the
was
up
and
we
were
at
the
temple
gate
the
building
somewhat
isolated
reared
itself
before
us
a
grand
conception
in
chiseled
marble
glinting
in
the
brilliant
lights
shot
upon
it
from
various
high
points
already
it
was
dark
beyond
the
radius
of
these
lights
neither
of
the
moons
having
yet
appeared
severnius
dismissed
the
sleigh
saying
that
we
would
walk
home
the
distance
was
not
far
and
we
entered
the
grounds
and
proceeded
to
mount
the
flight
of
broad
steps
leading
up
to
the
magnificent
arched
entrance
the
great
carved
doors
the
carvings
were
emblematic
swung
back
and
admitted
us
the
temple
was
splendidly
illuminated
within
and
imagination
could
not
picture
anything
more
imposing
than
the
great
central
hall
and
winding
stairs
visible
all
the
way
up
to
the
dome
below
on
one
side
of
this
lofty
hall
there
were
extensive
and
luxurious
baths
severnius
said
the
members
of
the
order
were
fond
of
congregating
here
and
i
did
not
wonder
at
that
nothing
that
appertains
to
such
an
establishment
was
lacking
chairs
and
sofas
that
we
would
call
turkish
thick
soft
rugs
and
carpets
pictures
statuary
mirrors
growing
plants
rare
flowers
books
musical
instruments
and
severnius
told
me
the
waters
were
delightful
for
bathing
the
second
story
consisted
of
a
series
of
spacious
rooms
divided
from
each
other
by
costly
portieres
into
which
the
various
emblems
and
devices
were
woven
in
their
proper
tinctures
all
of
these
rooms
were
as
sumptuously
furnished
as
those
connected
with
the
baths
and
the
decorations
i
thought
were
even
more
beautiful
of
a
little
higher
or
finer
order
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
lady
was
playing
upon
an
instrument
resembling
a
harp
she
dropped
her
hands
from
the
strings
and
came
forward
graciously
perhaps
we
are
intruding
said
severnius
ah
no
indeed
she
laughed
pleasantly
no
one
could
be
more
welcome
here
than
the
brother
of
our
supreme
sorceress
happy
the
man
who
has
a
distinguished
sister
returned
he
i
am
unfortunate
she
answered
with
a
slight
blush
severnius
is
always
welcome
for
his
own
sake
he
acknowledged
the
compliment
and
with
a
certain
reluctance
i
thought
said
will
you
allow
me
claris
to
introduce
my
friend
from
another
planet
she
took
a
swift
step
toward
me
and
held
out
her
hand
i
have
long
had
a
great
curiosity
to
meet
you
sir
she
said
i
bowed
low
over
her
hand
and
murmured
that
her
curiosity
could
not
possibly
equal
the
pleasure
i
felt
in
meeting
her
she
gave
severnius
a
quick
questioning
look
i
believe
she
thought
he
had
told
me
something
about
her
he
let
her
think
what
she
liked
how
is
it
you
are
here
he
asked
you
mean
instead
of
being
with
the
others
she
returned
i
have
not
been
well
lately
and
i
thought
or
my
husband
thought
i
had
better
not
join
the
procession
i
am
awaiting
them
here
as
she
spoke
i
noticed
that
she
was
rather
delicate
looking
she
was
tall
and
slight
with
large
bright
eyes
and
a
transparent
complexion
if
elodia
had
not
filled
all
space
in
my
consciousness
i
think
i
should
have
been
considerably
interested
in
her
i
liked
her
frank
direct
way
of
meeting
us
and
talking
to
us
we
soon
left
her
and
continued
our
explorations
i
wanted
to
ask
severnius
something
about
her
but
i
thought
he
avoided
the
subject
he
told
me
however
that
her
husband
massilia
was
one
of
his
closest
friends
and
then
he
added
i
wonder
that
she
took
his
advice
why
so
i
asked
do
not
women
here
ever
take
their
advice
claris
is
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
he
returned
with
i
thought
some
severity
and
then
he
immediately
spoke
of
something
else
quite
foreign
to
her
the
third
and
last
story
comprised
an
immense
hall
or
assembly
room
and
rows
of
deep
closets
for
the
robes
and
paraphernalia
of
the
members
of
the
order
in
one
of
these
closets
a
skeleton
was
suspended
from
the
ceiling
and
underneath
it
stood
a
coffin
on
a
shelf
were
three
skulls
with
their
accompanying
and
several
weapons
severnius
said
he
supposed
these
hideous
tokens
were
employed
in
the
initiation
of
new
members
it
seemed
incredible
i
thought
that
if
it
were
so
the
marsian
women
must
have
stronger
nerves
than
ours
a
great
many
beautiful
marble
columns
and
pillars
supported
the
roof
of
the
hall
and
the
walls
had
a
curiously
fluted
appearance
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sculpture
not
only
figures
but
flowers
vines
and
all
manner
of
decorations
even
draperies
chiseled
in
marble
that
looked
like
frozen
lace
with
an
awful
stillness
in
their
ghostly
folds
there
was
a
magnificent
canopied
throne
on
an
elevation
like
an
pulpit
and
seats
for
satellites
on
either
side
and
at
the
base
if
i
had
been
alone
i
would
have
gone
up
and
knelt
down
before
the
throne
for
of
course
that
was
where
elodia
sat
and
i
would
have
kissed
the
yellow
cushion
on
which
her
feet
were
wont
to
rest
when
she
wielded
her
jeweled
scepter
the
scepter
i
observed
lay
on
the
there
was
an
orchestra
and
there
were
stations
for
the
various
officials
and
the
walls
were
adorned
with
innumerable
cabalistic
insignia
i
asked
severnius
if
he
knew
the
meaning
of
any
of
them
how
should
i
know
he
replied
in
surprise
only
the
initiates
understand
those
things
then
these
women
keep
their
secrets
said
i
yes
to
be
sure
they
do
he
replied
the
apartment
to
the
right
on
the
entrance
floor
opposite
the
baths
was
the
last
we
looked
into
and
was
a
magnificent
banquet
hall
a
servant
who
stood
near
the
door
opened
it
as
though
it
had
been
the
door
of
a
shrine
and
no
wonder
it
was
a
noble
room
in
its
dimensions
and
in
all
its
unparalleled
adornments
and
appurtenances
the
walls
and
ceiling
bristled
with
candelabra
all
alight
the
tables
set
for
a
banquet
held
everything
that
could
charm
the
eye
or
tempt
the
appetite
in
such
a
place
i
observed
a
great
many
inverted
stemglasses
of
various
exquisite
styles
and
patterns
including
the
thin
flaring
goblets
as
delicate
as
a
which
mean
the
same
thing
to
marsians
as
to
us
do
these
women
drink
champagne
at
their
banquets
i
asked
with
a
frown
o
yes
replied
severnius
a
banquet
would
be
rather
tame
without
would
it
the
auroras
are
not
much
given
to
drink
ordinarily
but
on
occasions
like
this
they
are
liable
to
indulge
pretty
freely
is
it
possible
i
could
say
no
more
than
this
and
severnius
went
on
the
auroras
you
see
are
the
cream
of
our
society
the
and
costly
drinks
are
typical
in
a
way
of
the
highest
refinement
do
you
people
never
drink
wine
at
your
social
gatherings
the
men
do
of
course
but
not
the
women
i
replied
in
a
tone
which
the
whole
commonwealth
of
paleveria
might
have
taken
as
a
rebuke
ah
i
fear
i
shall
never
be
able
to
understand
said
he
it
is
very
confusing
to
my
mind
this
having
two
codes
social
as
well
as
political
to
apply
separately
to
members
of
an
identical
community
i
do
see
how
you
can
draw
the
line
so
sharply
it
is
like
having
two
distinct
currents
in
a
do
the
waters
ever
get
mixed
you
are
facetious
i
returned
coldly
no
really
i
am
in
earnest
said
he
do
no
women
in
your
country
ever
do
these
things
parade
and
drink
wine
and
the
like
which
you
say
you
men
are
not
above
doing
i
replied
with
considerable
energy
i
have
never
before
seen
women
of
any
sort
dress
themselves
up
in
conspicuous
uniforms
and
exhibit
themselves
publicly
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
being
seen
and
making
a
sensation
except
in
circuses
and
circus
women
well
they
do
count
and
of
course
we
have
a
class
of
women
who
crack
champagne
bottles
and
even
quaff
other
fiery
liquors
as
freely
as
men
but
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
what
kind
of
creatures
those
are
at
that
moment
there
were
sounds
of
tramping
feet
outside
and
the
orchestra
filed
in
at
the
farther
end
of
the
and
took
their
places
on
a
high
dais
at
a
given
signal
every
instrument
was
in
position
and
the
music
burst
forth
and
simultaneously
the
banqueters
began
to
march
in
they
had
put
off
their
heavy
outside
garments
but
retained
their
ornaments
and
insignia
their
white
necks
and
arms
gleamed
bewitchingly
through
silvered
lace
they
moved
to
their
places
without
the
least
jostling
or
awkwardness
their
every
step
and
motion
proving
their
high
cultivation
and
grace
we
must
get
out
of
here
whispered
severnius
in
some
consternation
but
a
squad
of
servants
clogged
the
doorway
and
we
were
crowded
backward
and
in
the
interest
of
we
took
refuge
in
a
small
alcove
behind
a
screen
of
tall
plants
with
enormous
leaves
and
fronds
good
heavens
what
shall
we
do
cried
severnius
beginning
to
perspire
let
us
sit
down
said
i
who
saw
nothing
very
dreadful
in
the
situation
except
that
it
was
warm
and
the
odor
of
the
blossoms
in
front
of
us
was
overpowering
there
was
a
bench
in
the
alcove
and
we
seated
ourselves
upon
it
i
with
much
comfort
for
it
was
a
little
cooler
down
there
and
my
companion
with
much
fear
would
it
be
a
disgrace
if
we
were
found
here
i
asked
i
would
not
be
found
here
for
the
world
replied
severnius
it
would
not
be
a
disgrace
but
it
would
be
considered
highly
improper
or
to
put
it
so
that
you
can
better
understand
it
it
would
be
the
same
as
though
they
were
men
and
we
women
that
is
clear
said
i
and
i
pictured
to
myself
two
charming
new
york
girls
of
my
acquaintance
secreting
themselves
in
a
hall
where
we
city
guards
were
holding
a
banquet
ye
gods
as
the
feast
progressed
and
as
my
senses
were
almost
swept
away
by
the
scent
of
the
flowers
i
sometimes
half
fancied
that
it
the
city
guards
who
were
seated
at
the
tables
during
the
first
everything
was
carried
on
with
great
dignity
speakers
being
introduced
this
occurred
in
the
interim
between
courses
in
proper
order
and
responding
with
graceful
and
remarks
which
were
suitably
applauded
but
after
the
glasses
had
been
emptied
a
time
or
two
all
around
there
came
a
change
with
which
i
was
very
familiar
jokes
abounded
and
jolly
little
songs
were
sung
o
nothing
you
would
take
exception
to
you
know
if
they
had
been
men
but
women
beautiful
cultivated
charming
women
with
eyes
like
stars
with
cheeks
that
matched
the
dawn
with
lips
that
you
would
have
liked
to
kiss
and
more
than
this
the
preservers
of
our
ideals
the
interpreters
of
our
faith
the
keepers
of
our
consciences
i
felt
as
though
my
traditionary
idols
were
shattered
until
i
remembered
that
these
were
not
my
countrywomen
thank
heaven
severnius
was
not
at
all
surprised
he
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
and
was
chiefly
concerned
about
how
we
were
going
to
get
out
of
there
it
was
more
easily
accomplished
than
we
could
have
imagined
the
elegant
candelabra
were
a
cunningly
contrived
system
of
electric
lights
and
as
sometimes
happens
with
us
they
went
out
suddenly
and
left
the
place
in
darkness
for
a
few
convenient
seconds
quick
now
cried
severnius
with
a
bound
and
there
was
just
time
for
us
to
make
our
escape
we
had
barely
reached
the
outer
door
when
the
whole
building
was
ablaze
again
severnius
offered
no
comments
on
the
events
of
the
evening
except
to
say
we
were
lucky
to
get
out
as
we
did
and
of
course
i
made
none
at
my
suggestion
we
stopped
at
the
observatory
and
spent
a
few
hours
there
lost
among
the
stars
my
soul
recovered
its
equilibrium
i
have
found
that
little
things
cease
to
fret
when
i
can
lift
my
thoughts
to
great
things
it
must
have
been
near
morning
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
jingling
of
bells
and
a
sleigh
driving
into
the
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
elodia
and
her
maid
coming
up
the
stairs
her
maid
attended
her
everywhere
and
stationed
herself
about
like
a
dummy
she
was
the
sign
always
that
elodia
was
not
far
off
and
i
am
sure
she
would
have
laid
down
her
life
for
her
mistress
and
would
have
suffered
her
tongue
to
be
cut
out
before
she
would
have
betrayed
her
secrets
i
tell
you
this
to
show
you
what
a
power
of
fascination
elodia
possessed
she
seemed
a
being
to
be
worshiped
by
high
and
low
severnius
and
i
ate
our
breakfast
alone
the
following
morning
the
supreme
sorceress
did
not
get
up
nor
did
she
go
down
town
to
attend
to
business
at
all
during
the
day
at
lunch
time
she
sent
her
maid
down
to
tell
severnius
that
she
had
a
headache
quite
likely
he
returned
as
the
girl
delivered
her
message
but
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
her
tell
her
to
let
me
know
the
girl
made
her
obeisance
and
vanished
we
have
to
pay
for
our
fun
said
severnius
with
a
sigh
i
should
not
think
your
sister
would
indulge
in
such
i
retorted
as
a
kind
of
relief
to
my
hurt
sensibilities
i
was
so
cruelly
disappointed
in
elodia
why
my
sister
in
particular
returned
he
with
a
look
of
surprise
well
of
course
i
mean
all
those
women
why
do
they
do
such
things
it
is
unwomanly
it
it
is
disgraceful
i
could
not
keep
the
word
back
and
for
the
first
time
i
saw
a
flash
of
anger
in
my
friend
eyes
come
said
he
you
must
not
talk
like
that
that
term
may
have
a
different
signification
to
you
but
with
us
it
means
an
insult
i
quickly
begged
his
pardon
and
tried
to
explain
to
him
our
women
i
said
never
do
things
of
that
sort
as
i
have
told
you
they
have
no
taste
for
them
and
no
inclination
in
that
direction
it
is
against
their
very
nature
and
if
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
so
i
can
not
but
think
that
such
indulgence
as
we
witnessed
last
night
must
coarsen
a
woman
spiritual
fibre
and
dull
the
fine
moral
sense
which
is
so
highly
developed
in
her
excuse
me
interposed
severnius
you
have
shown
me
in
the
case
of
your
own
sex
that
human
nature
is
the
same
on
the
earth
that
it
is
on
mars
you
would
not
have
me
think
that
there
are
two
varieties
of
human
nature
on
your
planet
corresponding
with
the
sexes
would
you
you
say
spiritual
fibre
and
fine
moral
sense
as
though
she
had
an
exclusive
title
to
those
qualities
my
dear
sir
it
is
impossible
you
are
all
born
of
woman
and
are
one
flesh
and
one
blood
whether
you
are
male
or
female
i
admit
all
you
say
about
the
unwholesome
influence
of
such
indulgence
as
wine
drinking
late
hours
questionable
stories
and
songs
a
night
debauch
in
fact
which
it
requires
days
sometimes
to
recover
from
but
i
must
apply
it
to
men
as
well
as
women
neither
are
at
their
best
under
such
conditions
i
think
he
went
on
that
i
begin
to
understand
the
distinction
which
you
have
curiously
mistaken
for
a
radical
difference
your
women
you
say
have
always
been
in
a
state
of
no
no
i
cried
i
never
said
so
on
the
contrary
they
hold
the
very
highest
place
with
us
they
are
honored
with
chivalrous
devotion
cared
for
with
the
tenderest
consideration
we
men
are
their
slaves
in
reality
though
they
call
us
their
lords
we
work
for
them
endure
hardships
for
them
give
them
all
that
we
can
of
wealth
luxury
ease
and
we
defend
them
from
danger
and
save
them
every
annoyance
in
our
power
they
are
the
queens
of
our
hearts
and
homes
that
may
all
be
he
replied
coolly
but
you
admit
that
they
have
always
been
denied
their
political
rights
and
it
follows
that
their
social
rights
should
be
similarly
limited
long
abstinence
from
the
indulgences
which
you
regard
as
purely
masculine
has
resulted
in
a
habit
merely
not
a
change
in
their
nature
then
thank
heaven
for
their
abstinence
i
exclaimed
that
is
all
very
well
he
persisted
but
you
must
concede
that
in
the
first
place
it
was
forced
upon
them
and
that
was
an
injustice
because
they
were
intelligent
beings
and
your
equals
they
ought
to
thank
us
for
the
injustice
then
i
retorted
i
beg
your
pardon
they
ought
not
no
doubt
they
are
very
lovely
and
innocent
beings
and
that
your
world
is
the
better
for
them
but
they
being
restricted
in
other
ways
by
man
authority
or
his
wishes
or
by
fear
of
his
disfavor
perhaps
have
acquired
these
gentle
qualities
at
the
expense
of
or
in
the
place
of
others
more
essential
to
the
foundation
of
character
i
mean
strength
dignity
and
that
which
you
once
attributed
to
my
sister
responsibility
i
was
bursting
with
indignant
things
which
i
longed
to
say
but
my
position
was
delicate
and
i
bit
my
tongue
and
was
silent
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
my
heart
warmed
toward
my
gentle
countrywomen
with
all
their
follies
and
frivolities
with
all
their
inconsistencies
and
unaccountable
ways
their
whimsical
fancies
and
petty
tempers
their
emotions
and
their
susceptibility
to
new
isms
and
religions
they
still
represented
my
highest
and
best
ideals
and
i
thought
of
elodia
sick
upstairs
from
her
last
night
carousal
with
contempt
chapter
elodia
if
to
her
lot
some
female
errors
fall
look
to
her
face
and
you
forget
them
all
pope
my
contempt
for
elodia
vanished
at
the
first
intimation
of
her
presence
i
had
expected
to
meet
her
with
an
air
of
cold
superiority
but
when
she
entered
the
that
evening
with
her
usual
careless
aplomb
the
glance
with
which
she
favored
me
reduced
me
to
my
customary
attitude
toward
her
that
of
unquestioning
admiration
our
physical
nature
is
weak
and
this
woman
dominated
my
senses
completely
with
her
beauty
with
her
melodious
voice
her
singular
magnetic
attraction
and
every
casual
expression
of
her
face
on
that
particular
evening
her
dress
was
more
than
ordinarily
becoming
i
thought
she
had
left
off
some
of
the
draperies
she
usually
wore
about
her
shoulders
and
her
round
perfect
waist
was
more
fully
disclosed
in
outline
she
was
somewhat
pale
and
her
eyes
seemed
larger
and
darker
than
their
wont
and
had
deeper
shadows
and
a
certain
air
of
languor
that
hung
about
her
was
an
added
grace
she
had
however
recovered
sufficiently
from
the
dissipations
of
the
day
before
to
make
herself
uncommonly
agreeable
and
i
never
felt
in
a
greater
degree
the
charm
and
stimulus
of
her
presence
and
conversation
after
dinner
she
preceded
us
into
the
parlor
which
was
unusual
for
she
was
always
too
sparing
of
her
society
and
the
most
we
saw
of
her
was
at
dinner
or
luncheon
time
and
crossed
over
to
an
alcove
where
stood
a
large
and
costly
harp
whose
strings
she
knew
well
how
to
thrum
elodia
you
have
never
sung
for
our
friend
said
severnius
she
shook
her
head
and
letting
her
eyes
rest
upon
me
almost
as
if
i
were
not
there
in
fact
for
she
had
a
peculiar
way
of
looking
at
you
without
actually
seeing
you
she
went
on
picking
out
the
air
she
had
started
to
play
i
subjoined
a
beseeching
look
to
her
brother
suggestive
remark
but
was
not
sure
she
noted
it
but
presently
she
began
to
sing
and
i
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
her
voice
was
sweet
with
a
quality
that
stirred
unwonted
feelings
but
it
was
not
that
alone
as
she
stood
there
in
the
majesty
of
her
gracious
womanhood
her
exquisite
figure
showing
at
its
best
her
eyes
uplifted
and
a
something
that
meant
power
radiating
from
her
whole
being
i
felt
that
do
what
she
might
she
was
still
the
grandest
creature
in
that
world
to
me
soon
after
she
had
finished
her
song
while
i
was
still
in
the
thrall
of
it
a
servant
entered
the
room
with
a
packet
for
severnius
who
opened
and
read
it
with
evident
surprise
and
delight
elodia
he
cried
those
friends
of
mine
those
caskians
from
lunismar
are
coming
to
make
us
a
visit
indeed
she
answered
without
much
enthusiasm
and
severnius
turned
to
me
it
is
on
your
account
my
friend
that
i
am
to
be
indebted
to
them
for
this
great
pleasure
he
explained
on
my
account
said
i
yes
they
have
heard
about
you
and
are
extremely
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
they
must
be
said
elodia
to
care
to
travel
a
thousand
miles
or
so
in
order
to
do
it
who
are
they
pray
i
asked
they
are
a
people
so
extraordinarily
good
she
said
with
a
laugh
so
refined
and
sublimated
that
they
cast
no
shadow
in
the
sun
severnius
gave
her
a
look
of
mild
protest
they
are
a
race
exactly
like
ourselves
outwardly
he
said
who
inhabit
a
mountainous
and
very
picturesque
country
called
caskia
in
the
northern
part
of
this
continent
o
that
is
where
the
perfect
pair
came
from
i
rejoined
remembering
what
he
had
told
me
about
man
origin
on
mars
elodia
smiled
has
severnius
been
entertaining
you
with
our
religious
fables
she
asked
i
glanced
at
him
and
saw
that
he
had
not
heard
he
was
finishing
his
letter
you
will
be
interested
in
these
caskians
he
said
to
me
animatedly
as
he
folded
it
up
i
was
i
spent
some
months
in
lunismar
their
capital
once
studying
they
have
rare
facilities
for
reading
the
heavens
there
i
mean
of
their
own
contrivance
beside
their
natural
advantages
their
high
altitude
and
the
clearness
of
the
air
and
they
name
themselves
after
the
planetoids
and
other
heavenly
bodies
interjected
elodia
because
they
live
so
near
the
stars
what
is
the
name
of
the
superlative
creature
you
were
so
charmed
with
severnius
i
suppose
you
mean
my
friend
calypso
wife
clytia
returned
he
o
yes
i
remember
clytia
is
she
to
favor
us
yes
and
her
husband
and
several
others
any
other
women
one
or
two
i
think
and
how
are
we
to
conduct
ourselves
during
the
visitation
as
we
always
do
you
will
not
find
that
they
will
put
any
constraint
upon
you
no
hardly
said
elodia
with
a
slight
curl
of
the
lip
i
was
eager
to
hear
more
about
these
singular
people
the
more
eager
perhaps
because
the
thought
of
them
seemed
to
arouse
elodia
to
an
unwonted
degree
of
feeling
and
interest
her
eyes
glowed
intensely
and
the
color
flamed
brightly
in
her
cheeks
i
pressed
a
question
or
two
upon
severnius
and
he
responded
according
to
the
traditions
and
annals
of
the
caskians
they
began
many
thousands
of
years
ago
to
train
themselves
toward
the
highest
culture
and
most
perfect
development
of
which
mankind
is
capable
their
aim
was
nothing
short
of
the
ideal
and
they
believed
that
the
ideal
was
possible
it
took
many
centuries
to
counteract
and
finally
to
eradicate
hereditary
evils
but
their
courage
and
perseverance
did
not
give
way
and
they
triumphed
they
have
dropped
the
baser
natural
propensities
as
in
the
course
of
evolution
it
is
said
certain
species
of
animals
dropped
their
tails
to
become
man
interrupted
elodia
she
rose
from
the
divan
on
which
she
had
gracefully
disposed
herself
when
she
quit
playing
and
glided
from
the
room
sweeping
a
bow
to
us
as
she
vanished
before
severnius
or
i
could
interpose
an
objection
to
her
leaving
us
although
there
was
never
any
appearance
of
haste
in
her
manner
she
had
a
swift
celerity
of
movement
which
made
it
impossible
to
anticipate
her
intention
severnius
however
did
not
care
to
interpose
an
objection
i
think
he
felt
somewhat
hurt
by
her
sarcastic
comments
upon
his
friends
and
he
expanded
more
after
she
had
gone
you
must
certainly
visit
lunismar
before
you
leave
mars
he
said
you
will
feel
well
repaid
for
the
trouble
it
is
a
beautiful
city
wonderful
in
its
cleanness
in
its
dearth
of
poverty
and
squalor
and
in
the
purity
and
elevation
of
its
social
tone
i
think
you
will
wish
you
might
live
there
always
there
seemed
to
be
a
regret
in
his
voice
and
i
asked
why
did
not
you
remain
there
because
of
my
sister
he
answered
but
she
will
marry
doubtless
for
some
occult
reason
i
hung
upon
his
reply
to
this
he
shook
his
head
i
do
not
think
she
will
he
said
and
she
and
i
are
all
that
are
left
of
our
family
she
does
not
like
or
she
does
not
believe
in
these
caskians
i
hoped
he
would
contradict
me
and
he
did
i
had
come
to
found
my
judgments
of
people
and
of
things
upon
elodia
even
against
the
testimony
of
my
reason
if
she
disapproved
of
her
extraordinary
friends
and
thought
them
an
impossible
people
why
then
i
knew
i
should
have
misgivings
of
them
too
and
i
wanted
to
believe
in
them
not
only
on
severnius
account
but
because
they
presented
a
curious
study
in
psychology
o
yes
she
does
he
said
she
thinks
that
their
principles
and
their
lives
are
all
right
for
themselves
but
would
not
be
for
her
or
for
us
and
our
adoption
of
them
would
be
simply
apish
she
is
genuine
and
she
detests
imitation
she
accepts
herself
as
she
puts
it
as
she
found
herself
god
who
made
all
things
created
her
upon
a
certain
plane
of
life
and
with
certain
tastes
faculties
passions
and
propensities
and
that
it
is
not
her
office
to
disturb
or
distort
the
order
of
his
economy
she
does
not
argue
thus
in
earnest
i
deprecated
it
is
difficult
to
tell
when
elodia
is
in
earnest
he
replied
she
thinks
my
sanctuary
in
the
top
story
of
the
house
here
is
a
kind
of
weakness
because
i
brought
the
idea
from
lunismar
o
then
it
is
not
common
here
in
thursia
for
people
to
have
things
of
that
sort
in
their
homes
i
said
in
surprise
yes
it
has
gotten
to
be
rather
common
he
replied
since
you
put
in
yours
he
admitted
that
to
be
the
case
you
must
think
that
you
have
done
your
country
a
great
good
i
began
enthusiastically
in
introducing
so
beautiful
an
innovation
and
you
are
mistaken
he
interrupted
i
think
the
contrary
because
our
rich
people
and
some
who
are
not
rich
but
only
ambitious
took
it
up
as
a
fad
and
i
believe
it
has
really
worked
evil
it
is
considered
aristocratic
to
have
one
own
private
shrine
and
not
to
go
to
church
at
all
except
in
condescension
to
patronize
the
masses
elodia
saw
clearly
just
how
it
would
be
before
i
began
to
carry
out
my
plan
she
has
a
logical
mind
and
her
thought
travels
from
one
sequence
to
the
next
with
unfailing
accuracy
i
recall
her
saying
that
one
can
not
superinduce
the
customs
and
habits
of
one
society
upon
another
of
a
different
order
without
affectation
and
that
you
can
not
put
on
a
new
religion
like
a
new
garment
and
feel
yourself
free
in
it
does
she
not
believe
then
in
progress
development
only
along
the
familiar
lines
she
thinks
you
can
reach
outward
and
upward
from
your
natural
environment
but
you
must
not
tear
yourself
out
of
it
with
violence
however
she
admitted
that
my
sanctuary
was
well
enough
for
me
because
of
my
having
lived
among
the
caskians
and
studied
their
sublime
ethics
until
i
grew
into
the
meanings
of
them
but
no
person
can
take
them
from
me
because
i
could
not
bring
away
with
me
the
inexpressible
something
which
holds
those
people
together
in
a
perfect
unit
i
can
go
to
caskia
and
catch
the
spirit
of
their
religion
but
i
can
not
bring
caskia
here
it
was
a
mistake
in
so
far
as
my
neighbors
are
concerned
since
they
only
see
in
it
as
i
have
said
a
new
fashion
a
new
diversion
for
their
ennuied
thoughts
what
is
there
peculiar
about
the
religion
of
those
people
i
asked
the
most
peculiar
thing
about
it
is
that
they
live
it
rather
than
profess
it
he
replied
i
do
think
i
understand
said
i
and
after
a
consideration
of
the
matter
in
his
own
mind
he
tried
to
make
his
meaning
clear
to
me
do
you
often
hear
an
upright
man
professing
his
honesty
it
is
a
part
of
himself
he
is
so
free
of
the
law
which
enjoins
honesty
that
he
never
gives
it
a
thought
so
with
the
man
who
is
truly
religious
he
has
flung
off
the
harness
and
no
longer
needs
to
guide
himself
by
bit
and
rein
or
measure
his
conduct
by
the
written
code
my
friends
the
caskians
have
emancipated
themselves
from
the
thraldom
of
the
law
by
absorbing
its
principles
into
themselves
it
was
like
seed
sown
in
the
ground
the
germs
burst
from
the
husk
and
shot
upward
they
are
enjoying
the
flower
and
the
fruit
that
which
all
nations
and
peoples
and
all
individuals
prize
and
desire
above
everything
else
in
life
is
liberty
but
i
have
seen
few
here
in
paleveria
who
have
any
conception
of
the
vast
spiritual
meanings
of
the
word
we
limit
it
to
the
physical
we
say
liberty
as
though
that
were
all
you
admire
the
man
of
high
courage
because
in
that
one
thing
he
is
free
so
with
all
the
virtues
named
and
unnamable
he
is
greatest
who
has
loosed
himself
the
most
who
weighs
anchor
and
sails
away
triumphant
and
free
but
this
is
but
a
general
picture
of
the
caskians
let
me
particularize
we
are
forbidden
to
steal
by
both
our
civil
and
religious
canons
the
coarseness
of
such
a
command
would
offend
them
as
much
as
a
direct
charge
of
theft
would
offend
you
or
myself
so
exquisite
is
their
sense
of
the
rights
of
others
not
only
in
the
matter
of
property
but
in
a
thousand
subtle
ways
robbery
in
any
form
is
impossible
with
them
they
would
think
it
a
crying
sin
for
one
to
take
the
slightest
advantage
of
another
nay
to
neglect
an
opportunity
to
assist
another
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
rightful
purpose
would
be
criminal
we
here
on
mars
and
you
upon
the
earth
have
discovered
very
sensitive
elements
in
nature
they
have
discovered
the
same
in
their
own
souls
their
perceptions
are
singularly
acute
their
touch
upon
each
other
lives
finely
delicate
in
this
respect
we
compare
with
them
as
the
rude
blacksmith
compares
with
the
worker
in
precious
metals
but
do
they
also
concern
themselves
with
science
i
asked
assuredly
he
answered
their
inventions
are
remarkable
their
methods
infinitely
superior
to
ours
they
believe
in
the
triple
nature
the
spiritual
the
intellectual
and
the
physical
and
take
equal
pains
in
the
development
and
culture
of
all
how
wonderful
i
said
remembering
that
upon
the
earth
we
have
waves
of
culture
breaking
over
the
land
from
time
to
time
spasmodic
and
never
the
same
it
may
be
physical
intellectual
and
a
superfine
spiritual
bloom
but
whichever
it
is
it
sacrifices
the
other
two
and
makes
itself
supreme
severnius
went
on
as
he
proceeded
i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
principles
of
our
christian
civilization
formed
the
basis
of
paleverian
law
i
wanted
to
give
you
some
other
instances
he
said
of
the
of
the
caskians
as
we
started
out
with
calling
them
there
is
a
law
with
us
against
bearing
false
witness
they
hold
each
other
in
such
honor
and
in
such
tenderness
that
the
command
is
an
idle
breath
there
is
nothing
mawkish
or
sentimental
about
this
however
they
in
fact
make
no
virtue
of
it
any
more
than
you
or
i
make
a
virtue
of
the
things
we
do
habitually
perhaps
from
unanalyzed
motives
of
policy
you
would
not
strike
a
man
if
you
knew
he
would
hit
back
and
hurt
you
worse
than
he
himself
was
hurt
well
these
people
have
sensibilities
so
finely
developed
that
a
wrong
done
to
another
reacts
upon
themselves
with
exquisite
suffering
the
law
and
its
penalties
are
both
unseen
forces
operating
on
an
internal
not
an
external
plane
with
us
the
authority
which
declares
shalt
not
commit
adultery
becomes
powerless
at
the
threshold
of
marriage
like
other
such
laws
which
hold
us
together
in
an
outward
appearance
of
decency
and
good
order
it
is
a
dead
letter
to
them
up
to
the
point
where
we
drop
and
trample
upon
it
here
they
take
it
up
and
carry
it
into
their
inmost
lives
and
thoughts
in
a
way
almost
too
fine
for
us
to
comprehend
because
we
have
never
so
much
as
dreamed
of
catching
the
spirit
of
that
law
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
with
a
wide
stare
why
that
marriage
does
not
sanction
lust
the
caskians
hold
that
the
exercise
of
the
procreative
faculty
is
a
divine
function
and
should
never
be
debased
to
mere
animal
indulgence
it
has
been
said
upon
divine
authority
as
we
believe
that
if
a
man
look
upon
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
he
has
committed
adultery
in
his
heart
the
caskians
interpret
that
to
mean
a
man
wife
the
same
as
any
other
woman
because
they
hold
one
who
owes
his
being
to
lust
and
passion
naturally
inherits
the
evil
and
the
curse
just
as
surely
as
though
wedlock
had
not
concealed
the
crime
their
children
are
conceived
in
immaculate
purity
my
look
of
prolonged
amazement
called
out
the
usual
question
have
you
no
such
class
in
any
of
your
highly
civilized
countries
no
i
think
not
with
us
children
do
not
come
in
answer
to
an
intelligent
desire
for
their
existence
but
are
too
often
simply
the
result
of
indulgence
and
so
unwelcome
that
their
life
is
overshadowed
by
sorrow
and
crime
well
said
he
it
is
the
same
here
our
people
believe
that
conception
without
lust
is
an
impossibility
in
nature
and
that
instances
of
it
are
supernatural
and
certainly
it
is
incredible
unless
your
mind
can
grasp
the
problem
or
rather
the
great
fact
of
a
people
engaged
for
centuries
in
eliminating
the
purely
animal
instincts
from
their
consciousness
after
a
moment
he
added
in
caskia
it
would
be
considered
shocking
if
a
pair
contemplating
marriage
were
to
provide
themselves
with
only
one
suite
of
rooms
to
be
shared
together
day
and
night
even
the
humblest
people
have
their
respective
apartments
they
think
such
separateness
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
perfect
development
of
the
individual
for
in
the
main
we
each
must
stand
alone
and
to
the
preservation
of
moral
dignity
and
the
fine
sentiment
and
mutual
respect
which
are
almost
certain
to
be
lost
in
the
lawlessness
of
undue
familiarity
the
relation
between
my
friend
calypso
and
his
wife
is
the
finest
thing
i
ever
saw
they
are
lovers
on
the
highest
plane
it
would
be
an
impossibility
for
either
of
them
to
say
or
do
a
coarse
or
improper
thing
in
the
other
presence
or
to
presume
in
any
of
the
innumerable
ways
you
and
i
are
familiar
with
in
our
observations
of
husbands
and
wives
upon
the
marriage
bond
existing
between
them
this
matter
of
animal
passion
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
has
been
at
the
bottom
of
untold
crimes
and
unnumbered
miseries
in
our
land
i
doubt
if
any
other
one
thing
has
been
prolific
of
more
or
greater
evils
even
the
greed
of
wealth
men
and
women
too
have
sacrificed
kingdoms
for
it
have
bartered
their
souls
for
it
countless
homes
have
been
desolated
because
of
it
countless
lives
and
hearts
have
been
laid
on
its
guilty
altar
we
ostracize
the
bastard
he
is
no
more
impure
than
the
offspring
of
legalized
licentiousness
and
the
law
which
protects
the
one
and
despises
the
other
can
not
discriminate
in
the
matter
of
after
effects
can
not
annul
or
enforce
the
curse
of
heredity
with
these
people
the
law
of
chastity
is
graven
in
the
inmost
heart
and
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
each
generation
acknowledges
its
obligation
to
the
next
chapter
the
vaporizer
portable
ecstasies
corked
up
in
a
pint
bottle
de
quincey
i
was
glad
when
spring
came
when
the
trees
began
to
bud
the
grass
to
grow
the
flowers
to
bloom
for
of
all
the
seasons
i
like
it
best
this
wonderful
resurrection
of
life
and
sweetness
thursia
is
a
fine
city
not
only
in
its
costly
and
architecturally
and
æsthetically
perfect
buildings
public
and
private
but
in
its
shaded
avenues
its
parks
lawns
gardens
fountains
its
idyllic
statues
and
its
monuments
to
greatness
severnius
took
pains
to
exhibit
all
its
attractions
to
me
driving
with
me
slowly
through
the
beautiful
streets
and
pointing
out
one
conspicuous
feature
and
another
of
course
there
were
some
streets
which
were
not
beautiful
but
he
avoided
those
as
much
as
possible
as
i
have
done
myself
when
i
have
had
friends
visiting
me
in
new
york
it
is
a
compliment
to
your
guest
to
show
him
the
best
there
is
and
to
spare
him
the
worst
but
often
too
we
took
long
walks
through
fields
and
woods
when
elodia
accompanied
us
which
she
did
a
few
times
the
whole
face
of
nature
smiled
and
i
thought
paleveria
the
most
incomparably
charming
country
i
had
ever
seen
her
presence
gave
importance
to
everything
the
song
of
a
bird
the
opening
of
a
humble
little
flower
the
babbling
of
water
but
other
things
absorbed
most
of
her
time
we
only
got
the
scraps
the
remnants
when
she
was
with
us
she
relaxed
as
though
we
were
in
some
sort
a
recreation
she
amused
herself
with
us
just
as
i
have
seen
a
busy
father
amuse
himself
with
his
family
for
an
hour
or
so
of
an
evening
and
i
think
we
really
planned
our
little
theatricals
of
evening
conversation
for
her
at
least
i
did
i
saved
up
whatever
came
to
me
of
thought
or
incident
to
give
to
her
at
the
dinner
table
and
she
appreciated
it
her
mind
bristled
with
keen
points
upon
which
any
ideas
let
loose
were
caught
in
a
flash
the
sudden
illumination
of
her
countenance
when
a
new
thing
or
even
an
old
thing
in
a
new
dress
was
presented
to
her
was
of
such
value
to
me
that
i
found
myself
laying
traps
for
it
inventing
stories
and
incidents
to
touch
her
fancy
besides
her
banking
interests
over
which
she
kept
a
close
surveillance
she
had
a
great
many
other
matters
that
required
to
be
looked
after
as
soon
as
the
weather
was
fine
enough
and
business
activities
in
the
city
began
to
be
redoubled
especially
in
the
matter
of
real
estate
she
made
a
point
of
driving
about
by
herself
to
inspect
one
piece
of
property
and
another
and
to
make
plans
and
see
that
they
were
carried
out
according
to
her
ideas
and
she
was
just
as
conscientious
in
the
discharge
of
her
official
duties
she
was
constantly
devising
means
for
the
betterment
of
the
schools
both
as
to
buildings
and
methods
of
instruction
i
believe
she
knew
every
teacher
personally
and
there
must
have
been
several
thousand
and
her
relations
with
all
of
them
were
cordial
and
friendly
her
approbation
was
a
thing
they
strove
for
and
valued
not
because
of
her
official
position
and
the
authority
she
held
in
her
hands
but
because
of
a
power
which
was
innate
in
herself
and
that
made
her
a
leader
and
a
protector
but
i
was
too
selfish
to
yield
my
small
right
to
her
society
the
right
only
of
a
guest
in
her
house
to
these
greater
claims
with
absolute
sweetness
and
patience
why
does
she
take
all
these
things
upon
herself
i
asked
of
severnius
because
she
has
a
taste
for
them
he
replied
or
as
she
would
say
a
need
of
them
it
is
an
internal
hunger
it
is
her
nature
to
exert
herself
in
these
ways
i
can
not
believe
it
is
her
nature
it
is
no
woman
nature
i
retorted
it
is
a
habit
which
she
has
cultivated
until
it
has
got
the
mastery
of
her
perhaps
returned
severnius
who
was
never
much
disposed
to
argue
about
his
sister
vagaries
as
they
seemed
to
me
all
this
is
mannish
i
went
on
there
are
other
things
for
women
to
do
why
does
she
not
give
her
time
and
attention
to
the
softer
graces
to
feminine
occupations
i
see
he
laughed
you
want
her
to
drop
these
weighty
matters
and
devote
herself
to
amusing
us
and
you
call
that
i
joined
in
his
laugh
ruefully
perhaps
i
am
narrow
and
selfish
too
i
admitted
but
she
is
so
charming
she
brings
so
much
into
our
conversations
whenever
we
can
entice
her
to
spend
a
moment
with
us
yes
that
is
true
he
answered
she
gleans
her
ideas
from
a
large
and
varied
field
i
do
not
mean
her
ideas
so
much
as
well
as
the
delicious
flavor
of
her
presence
and
personality
her
presence
and
her
personality
would
not
have
much
flavor
my
friend
if
she
had
no
ideas
i
am
thinking
o
yes
they
would
i
insisted
they
are
the
ether
in
which
our
own
thoughts
expand
and
take
shape
and
color
they
are
the
essence
of
her
supreme
beauty
he
shook
his
head
beauty
is
nothing
without
intelligence
what
is
the
camellia
beside
the
rose
elodia
is
the
rose
she
has
several
pleasing
qualities
that
appeal
to
you
at
one
and
the
same
time
this
was
rather
pretty
but
a
man
praises
of
his
sister
always
sound
tame
to
me
she
is
adorable
i
cried
with
fervor
we
were
walking
toward
a
depot
connected
with
a
great
railway
for
the
first
time
i
was
to
try
the
speed
of
a
marsian
train
severnius
wanted
me
to
visit
the
city
of
frambesco
some
two
hundred
miles
from
thursia
in
another
state
after
a
short
ruminating
silence
i
broke
out
again
we
do
even
have
her
company
evenings
to
any
extent
what
does
she
do
with
her
evenings
who
o
elodia
why
she
goes
to
her
club
for
recreation
you
know
that
is
complimentary
to
you
and
me
i
said
coolly
he
brought
his
spectacles
to
bear
upon
me
somewhat
sharply
do
you
think
you
are
a
little
unreasonable
he
demanded
you
have
curious
ideas
about
individual
liberty
now
we
hold
that
every
soul
shall
be
absolutely
free
that
is
in
its
relations
to
other
souls
it
shall
not
be
coerced
by
any
other
it
is
as
though
souls
were
stars
suspended
in
space
each
moving
in
its
appointed
orbit
no
one
has
the
right
to
disturb
the
poise
and
equilibrium
of
another
not
even
the
one
nearest
it
that
is
a
caskian
idea
by
the
way
about
the
only
one
elodia
is
enamored
of
these
souls
or
spheres
are
extremely
sensitive
and
they
may
and
do
exert
a
tremendous
influence
one
upon
another
but
without
violence
your
meaning
is
clear
i
said
coldly
my
powers
of
attraction
in
this
case
are
feeble
is
the
club
you
speak
of
composed
entirely
of
women
certainly
do
not
the
men
here
have
clubs
o
yes
i
belong
to
one
though
i
do
not
often
attend
i
will
take
you
to
visit
it
i
wonder
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
but
those
things
are
disturbing
we
scientists
like
to
keep
our
minds
clear
like
the
lenses
of
our
telescopes
is
elodia
club
a
literary
one
i
asked
though
i
was
almost
sure
it
was
not
o
no
it
is
for
recreation
purely
as
i
said
the
same
kind
of
a
club
i
suppose
that
you
men
have
of
course
they
have
the
current
literature
which
they
skim
over
and
discuss
so
as
to
keep
themselves
informed
about
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
it
is
the
only
way
you
can
keep
up
with
the
times
i
think
for
no
one
can
read
everything
they
have
games
and
various
diversions
elodia
clubhouse
is
furnished
with
elegant
baths
for
women
have
an
extraordinary
fondness
for
bathing
and
they
have
a
gymnasium
you
notice
what
splendid
figures
most
of
our
women
have
and
of
course
a
wine
cellar
severnius
i
cried
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
these
women
have
wines
in
their
clubhouse
why
yes
said
he
and
it
is
tolerated
allowed
nobody
objects
o
yes
there
are
plenty
of
objectors
he
replied
there
is
a
very
strong
element
here
but
it
has
no
actual
force
and
exerts
but
little
influence
in
in
our
circles
severnius
was
too
modest
a
man
to
boast
of
belonging
to
the
upper
class
of
society
but
that
was
what
our
circles
meant
but
do
not
the
male
relatives
of
these
women
object
their
husbands
fathers
brothers
no
indeed
why
should
they
we
do
the
same
things
they
do
without
demur
from
them
but
they
should
be
looking
after
their
domestic
affairs
their
children
their
homes
my
dear
sir
they
have
servants
to
attend
to
those
matters
it
seemed
useless
to
discuss
these
things
with
severnius
his
point
of
view
concerning
the
woman
question
was
so
different
from
mine
nevertheless
i
persisted
tell
me
severnius
do
women
on
this
planet
do
everything
that
men
do
they
have
that
liberty
he
replied
but
there
is
sometimes
a
difference
of
tastes
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
for
instance
they
do
not
smoke
by
the
way
have
a
cigar
he
passed
me
his
case
and
we
both
fired
up
there
is
a
peculiarly
delightful
flavor
in
marsian
tobacco
they
have
a
substitute
though
he
added
removing
the
fragrant
weed
from
his
lips
to
explain
they
vaporize
they
what
they
have
a
small
cup
a
little
larger
than
a
common
tobacco
pipe
which
they
fill
with
alcohol
and
pulverized
valerian
root
this
mixture
when
lighted
diffuses
a
kind
of
vapor
a
portion
of
which
they
inhale
through
the
a
slender
tortuous
tube
attached
to
the
cup
the
most
of
it
however
goes
into
the
general
air
good
heavens
i
cried
valerian
the
most
infernal
diabolical
smell
that
was
ever
emitted
from
any
known
or
unknown
substance
it
is
said
to
be
soothing
to
the
nerves
he
replied
but
do
you
not
find
it
horribly
disagreeable
unbearable
i
suddenly
recollected
that
in
passing
through
the
upper
hall
of
the
house
i
had
once
or
twice
detected
this
nauseating
odor
in
the
neighborhood
of
elodia
suite
of
rooms
yes
i
do
he
answered
when
i
happen
to
come
in
contact
with
it
which
is
seldom
they
are
careful
not
to
offend
others
to
whom
the
vapor
is
unpleasant
elodia
is
very
delicate
in
these
matters
she
is
fond
of
the
vapor
habit
but
she
allows
no
suggestion
of
it
to
cling
to
her
garments
or
vitiate
her
breath
it
must
be
a
great
care
to
deodorize
herself
i
returned
with
contempt
that
is
her
maid
business
said
he
is
it
not
injurious
to
health
i
asked
quite
so
it
often
induces
frightful
diseases
and
is
sometimes
fatal
to
life
even
and
yet
they
persist
in
it
i
should
think
you
would
interfere
in
your
sister
case
well
said
he
the
evils
which
attend
it
are
really
no
greater
than
those
that
wait
upon
the
tobacco
habit
and
as
i
smoke
i
advise
with
a
very
good
grace
i
have
a
sort
of
blind
faith
that
these
good
cigars
of
mine
are
not
going
to
do
me
any
harm
though
i
know
they
have
harmed
others
and
i
suppose
elodia
reasons
in
the
same
friendly
way
with
her
vapor
cup
the
train
stood
on
the
track
ready
to
start
i
was
about
to
spring
up
the
steps
of
the
last
car
when
severnius
stopped
me
not
that
one
he
said
that
is
the
woman
special
i
stepped
back
and
read
the
word
printed
in
large
gilt
letters
bent
like
a
bow
on
the
side
of
the
car
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
severnius
i
exclaimed
that
the
railroad
company
devotes
one
of
these
magnificent
coaches
exclusively
to
the
use
of
persons
addicted
to
the
obnoxious
habit
we
have
been
speaking
of
that
is
about
the
size
of
it
he
returned
he
borrowed
the
phrase
from
me
come
make
haste
or
we
shall
be
left
the
next
car
is
the
smoker
we
step
into
that
and
finish
these
cigars
after
which
i
show
you
what
sumptuous
parlor
coaches
we
have
as
we
mounted
to
the
platform
i
could
not
resist
glancing
into
the
there
were
only
two
or
three
ladies
there
and
one
of
them
held
in
her
ungloved
hand
the
little
cup
with
the
tortuous
stem
which
my
friend
had
described
to
me
from
it
there
issued
a
pale
blue
smoke
or
vapor
and
oh
the
smell
of
it
i
held
my
breath
and
hurried
after
severnius
that
is
the
most
outrageous
abominable
thing
i
ever
heard
of
i
declared
as
we
entered
the
smoker
and
took
our
seats
o
it
is
nothing
he
returned
smiling
you
are
a
very
fastidious
fellow
i
saw
you
look
into
that
car
did
you
observe
the
lady
in
blue
i
should
think
i
did
she
was
in
the
act
i
replied
and
i
recognized
her
too
she
is
that
madam
claris
you
introduced
me
to
in
the
auroras
temple
is
she
not
yes
but
did
you
notice
her
cup
not
particularly
it
is
carved
out
of
the
rarest
wood
we
have
wood
that
hardens
like
stone
with
age
and
has
an
indestructible
lining
and
is
studded
with
costly
gems
the
thing
is
celebrated
an
heirloom
in
claris
family
they
like
to
sport
those
things
the
owners
of
them
do
they
are
a
mark
of
distinction
or
as
they
might
say
in
some
of
your
countries
a
patent
of
nobility
i
suppose
then
that
only
the
rich
and
the
aristocratic
by
no
means
whatever
the
aristocracy
do
humble
folk
essay
to
imitate
these
vapor
cups
are
made
in
great
quantities
of
the
commonest
clay
and
sold
for
a
penny
apiece
then
it
must
be
a
natural
taste
among
your
women
said
i
no
no
more
than
smoking
is
among
men
they
say
it
is
nauseating
in
the
extreme
at
first
and
requires
great
courage
and
persistence
to
continue
in
it
up
to
the
point
of
liking
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
becomes
very
agreeable
to
them
in
the
end
and
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
break
the
habit
when
once
it
is
fixed
and
what
do
they
do
with
their
cups
i
mean
how
do
they
carry
them
about
when
they
are
not
using
them
i
asked
put
them
in
a
morocco
case
the
same
as
you
would
a
meerschaum
and
drop
them
into
a
fanciful
little
bag
which
they
wear
on
the
arm
suspended
by
a
chain
or
ribbon
frambesco
could
not
compare
with
thursia
either
in
size
or
beauty
and
it
had
a
totally
different
air
a
kind
of
swagger
you
might
say
i
felt
the
mercury
in
my
moral
barometer
drop
down
several
degrees
as
we
walked
about
the
streets
amid
much
filth
and
foul
odors
and
unsightly
spectacles
i
made
the
natural
comments
to
my
friend
and
he
replied
that
neither
frambesco
nor
any
other
city
on
the
continent
could
hold
a
candle
to
thursia
where
the
best
of
every
thing
was
centered
we
observed
a
great
many
enormous
placards
posted
about
conspicuously
announcing
a
game
of
fisticuffs
to
take
place
that
afternoon
in
an
amphitheatre
devoted
to
such
purposes
and
we
decided
to
look
in
upon
it
i
think
it
was
i
who
suggested
it
for
i
had
no
little
curiosity
about
the
tactics
of
the
manly
art
in
that
country
having
seen
sullivan
and
several
other
famous
hitters
in
our
own
severnius
had
considerable
difficulty
in
procuring
tickets
and
finally
paid
a
fabulous
price
to
a
speculator
for
convenient
seats
the
great
cost
of
admission
of
course
kept
out
the
rabble
and
in
a
way
it
was
an
eminently
respectable
throng
that
was
assembled
i
mean
in
so
far
as
money
and
rich
clothes
make
for
respectability
but
there
was
an
unmistakable
coarseness
in
most
of
the
faces
or
if
not
that
a
curiosity
which
bordered
on
coarseness
i
was
amazed
to
see
women
in
the
audience
but
this
was
nothing
to
the
horror
that
quivered
through
me
like
a
deadly
wound
when
the
combatants
sprang
into
the
arena
and
squared
off
for
action
for
they
too
were
women
women
with
tender
rosy
flesh
with
splendid
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
high
excitement
their
long
fair
hair
was
braided
and
twisted
into
a
hard
knot
on
top
of
the
head
they
wore
no
gloves
ah
a
woman
hands
are
soft
enough
without
padding
i
thought
they
went
at
it
in
scientific
fashion
and
were
careful
to
observe
the
etiquette
of
the
game
it
was
held
foul
to
attack
the
face
in
fact
it
was
more
of
a
wrestling
than
a
sparring
match
a
test
of
strength
prowess
agility
but
i
recoiled
from
it
with
loathing
and
feeling
myself
grow
sick
and
faint
i
muttered
something
to
severnius
and
rushed
out
of
the
place
he
followed
me
of
course
the
performance
was
quite
as
distasteful
to
him
as
to
me
the
only
difference
being
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
idea
and
i
was
not
as
i
passed
out
i
observed
that
many
of
the
women
were
vaporizing
and
many
of
the
men
smoking
i
suppose
it
was
in
part
the
intolerable
abomination
of
these
commingled
smells
that
affected
me
for
i
experienced
a
physical
as
well
as
moral
nausea
i
did
not
get
over
it
for
hours
and
i
was
as
glad
as
a
child
when
it
came
time
to
take
the
train
back
to
thursia
my
disgust
was
so
great
that
i
could
not
discuss
the
matter
with
severnius
as
i
was
wont
to
discuss
other
matters
with
him
there
was
one
thing
for
which
i
was
supremely
thankful
that
elodia
was
not
there
a
few
days
later
the
subject
accidentally
came
up
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
her
denounce
the
barbarity
as
emphatically
as
i
could
denounce
it
and
more
sweepingly
for
she
included
male
fighters
in
her
condemnation
and
i
was
unable
to
make
her
see
that
that
was
quite
another
matter
chapter
cupid
gardens
o
in
what
sweets
dost
thou
thy
sins
enclose
shakspeare
during
the
time
that
intervened
before
the
arrival
of
the
caskians
to
make
their
proposed
visit
i
gleaned
many
more
interesting
hints
from
severnius
relative
to
their
life
and
conduct
which
greatly
whetted
my
curiosity
to
meet
them
for
instance
we
were
one
day
engaged
in
a
conversation
he
elodia
and
myself
upon
the
subject
of
the
province
of
poetry
in
history
but
that
does
not
matter
when
dinner
was
announced
in
the
usual
way
that
is
the
way
which
assumes
without
doubt
that
nothing
else
in
the
world
is
so
important
as
dinner
it
may
be
a
bell
or
a
gong
or
a
verbal
call
but
it
is
as
imperative
as
the
command
of
an
autocrat
it
brings
to
the
ground
with
the
suddenness
of
a
mental
shock
the
finest
flights
of
the
imagination
it
wakes
the
soul
from
transcendent
dreams
cools
the
fervor
of
burning
eloquence
breaks
the
spell
of
music
more
than
this
it
destroys
the
delicate
combination
of
mental
states
and
forces
sometimes
induced
when
several
highly
trained
minds
have
fallen
into
an
attitude
of
acute
sympathy
toward
one
another
a
rare
and
ineffable
thing
and
are
borne
aloft
through
mutual
helpfulness
to
regions
of
thought
and
emotion
infinitely
exalted
which
can
never
be
reproduced
i
have
often
had
this
experience
myself
and
have
wished
that
the
cook
was
a
creature
of
supernatural
intuitions
so
that
he
could
divine
the
right
moment
in
which
to
proclaim
that
the
soup
was
served
there
is
a
right
moment
a
happy
moment
when
the
flock
of
intellectual
birds
let
loose
to
whirl
and
circle
and
soar
in
the
upper
air
descend
gracefully
and
of
their
own
accord
to
the
agreeable
level
of
soup
on
the
occasion
to
which
i
have
referred
i
tried
to
ignore
and
to
make
my
companions
ignore
the
discordant
summons
by
a
kind
of
dominant
action
of
my
mind
upon
theirs
in
order
that
we
might
continue
the
talk
a
little
longer
we
three
had
never
before
shown
ourselves
off
to
each
other
to
such
striking
advantage
we
traveled
miles
in
moments
we
expanded
we
unrolled
reams
of
intelligence
which
were
apprehended
in
a
flash
as
a
whole
landscape
is
apprehended
in
a
glare
of
lightning
it
was
as
if
our
words
were
tipped
with
flame
and
carried
their
illumination
along
with
them
i
knew
that
there
never
would
never
could
come
another
such
time
but
elodia
thwarted
my
effort
to
hold
it
a
moment
longer
come
she
cried
gayly
rising
to
her
feet
and
breaking
off
in
the
middle
of
a
beautiful
sentence
the
conclusion
of
which
i
was
waiting
for
with
tremors
of
delight
for
her
views
as
it
happened
accorded
with
mine
the
ideal
may
rule
in
art
but
not
in
life
it
is
very
unideal
to
eat
but
the
stomach
is
the
dial
of
the
world
we
make
it
so
said
severnius
of
course
we
make
all
our
sovereigns
she
returned
we
set
the
dial
to
point
at
certain
hours
and
it
simply
holds
us
to
our
agreement
it
and
the
that
reminds
me
of
our
caskian
friends
said
severnius
they
have
exceedingly
homes
but
occasionally
one
of
the
three
natures
waits
upon
another
the
mind
may
yield
to
some
contingency
connected
with
the
body
or
the
body
waive
its
right
in
favor
of
the
spirit
i
had
supposed
they
were
more
commented
elodia
with
her
usual
air
of
not
being
able
to
take
a
great
interest
in
the
caskians
they
are
the
farthest
from
that
of
any
people
i
know
he
answered
they
have
great
moments
now
and
then
when
a
few
people
are
gathered
together
and
their
thought
becomes
electrical
and
their
minds
mingle
as
you
have
seen
the
glances
of
eyes
mingle
in
a
language
more
eloquent
than
speech
and
to
tell
the
truth
we
ourselves
have
such
moments
i
not
deny
that
but
the
difference
is
that
they
appreciate
the
value
of
them
and
hold
them
fast
while
we
open
our
hands
and
let
them
fly
away
like
uncoveted
birds
or
worthless
butterflies
i
have
actually
known
a
meal
to
be
dropped
out
entirely
in
calypso
house
forgotten
in
the
felicity
of
an
intellectual
or
spiritual
delectation
thank
heaven
that
we
live
in
thursia
cried
elodia
where
such
lapses
are
impossible
they
are
next
to
impossible
there
said
severnius
but
they
do
happen
which
proves
a
great
deal
they
are
in
the
nature
of
miracles
they
are
so
wonderful
and
yet
not
so
wonderful
we
forget
sometimes
that
we
have
a
soul
and
they
forget
that
they
have
a
body
there
no
great
difference
there
is
a
mighty
difference
answered
elodia
we
are
put
into
a
material
world
to
enjoy
material
benefits
i
should
think
those
people
would
miss
a
great
deal
of
the
actual
good
of
life
in
the
pursuit
of
the
unactual
always
taking
their
flights
from
lofty
pinnacles
and
skipping
the
treasures
that
lie
in
the
valleys
on
the
contrary
he
returned
the
humblest
little
flower
that
grows
the
tiniest
pebble
they
pick
up
on
the
beach
the
smallest
voice
in
nature
all
have
place
in
their
economy
they
miss
nothing
they
gather
up
into
their
lives
all
the
treasures
that
nature
scatters
about
if
a
bird
sings
they
listen
and
say
song
is
for
me
or
if
a
blossom
opens
will
take
its
beauty
into
my
heart
these
things
which
are
free
to
all
they
accept
freely
their
physical
senses
are
supplemented
duplicated
as
it
were
in
finer
quality
by
exquisite
inner
perceptions
the
morning
after
this
conversation
severnius
and
i
took
a
long
drive
in
a
new
direction
we
went
up
the
river
a
mile
or
so
the
road
winding
through
an
avenue
of
elms
whose
great
graceful
branches
interlocked
overhead
and
made
a
shade
so
dense
that
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
green
we
were
so
earnestly
engaged
in
conversation
that
i
did
not
observe
when
we
left
the
avenue
and
entered
a
wood
we
drove
some
distance
through
this
and
then
the
road
branched
off
and
skirted
round
a
magnificent
park
the
finest
i
had
seen
bordered
by
a
thick
hedge
all
abloom
with
white
fragrant
flowers
and
fenced
with
a
fretwork
of
iron
finished
with
an
inverted
fringe
of
bristling
points
within
were
evidences
of
costly
and
elaborate
care
the
trees
were
of
noble
growth
and
the
greensward
like
stretches
of
velvet
over
which
flickered
and
played
the
disposition
of
shrubbery
and
flowers
the
chaste
and
beautiful
statuary
the
fountains
brooklets
arbors
and
retreats
the
rustic
effects
in
bridges
caves
grottoes
and
several
graceful
arches
hidden
in
wreathed
emerald
from
which
cherubs
with
wings
on
their
shoulders
peeped
roguishly
all
betokened
ingenious
design
and
skilful
and
artistic
execution
beyond
seen
vaguely
through
the
waving
foliage
were
handsome
buildings
of
the
elegant
stone
so
much
in
vogue
in
thursia
here
and
there
i
espied
a
fawn
one
pretty
creature
with
a
ribbon
round
its
neck
was
drinking
at
a
fountain
and
at
the
same
time
some
beautiful
birds
came
and
perched
upon
the
marble
rim
and
dipped
into
the
sparkling
water
how
lovely
how
idyllic
i
cried
what
place
is
it
severnius
and
why
have
i
never
seen
it
before
his
answer
came
a
little
reluctantly
i
thought
it
is
called
gardens
and
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
does
not
its
name
and
those
naked
imps
sufficiently
explain
it
he
replied
as
i
looked
at
him
a
blush
actually
mantled
his
cheek
it
is
a
rendezvous
he
explained
where
women
meet
their
lovers
how
curious
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
said
i
do
you
mean
that
the
place
was
planned
for
that
purpose
or
did
the
name
get
fastened
upon
it
through
accident
surely
you
are
joking
severnius
women
can
receive
their
lovers
in
their
homes
here
the
same
as
with
us
their
suitors
not
their
lovers
he
replied
you
make
a
curious
distinction
said
i
women
sometimes
marry
their
suitors
never
their
lovers
any
more
than
men
marry
their
mistresses
great
heavens
severnius
i
felt
the
blood
rush
to
my
face
and
then
recede
and
a
cold
perspiration
broke
out
all
over
me
there
was
a
question
in
my
mind
which
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
but
severnius
divined
it
is
it
a
new
idea
to
you
said
he
have
you
no
houses
of
prostitution
in
your
country
licensed
by
law
as
this
is
for
men
not
for
women
said
i
ah
another
of
your
peculiar
discriminations
he
returned
well
surely
you
will
agree
with
me
that
in
this
matter
at
least
there
should
be
discrimination
i
urged
he
shook
his
head
with
that
exasperating
stubbornness
one
occasionally
finds
in
people
no
i
can
not
agree
with
you
even
in
this
he
replied
what
possible
reason
is
there
why
men
more
than
women
should
be
privileged
to
indulge
in
vice
why
in
the
very
nature
of
things
i
cried
there
is
a
hygienic
principle
involved
you
know
it
is
a
statistical
fact
that
single
men
are
neither
so
vigorous
nor
so
as
married
men
and
a
good
many
men
do
not
marry
well
a
good
many
more
women
do
not
marry
what
of
those
severnius
i
can
not
believe
you
are
in
earnest
women
that
is
quite
another
matter
women
are
differently
constituted
from
men
their
nature
o
come
he
interrupted
i
thought
we
had
settled
that
question
that
their
nature
is
of
a
piece
with
our
own
it
happens
in
your
world
my
friend
that
your
women
were
kept
to
a
strict
line
of
conduct
according
to
your
account
by
a
severe
discipline
including
even
the
death
penalty
until
their
virtue
from
being
long
and
persistently
enforced
grew
into
a
habit
and
finally
became
a
question
of
honor
yes
stronger
than
death
thank
god
i
affirmed
well
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
excuse
men
have
to
offer
for
their
lack
of
chastity
i
refer
to
the
men
on
your
planet
is
that
they
have
not
been
hedged
about
by
the
wholesome
restraints
that
have
developed
in
women
i
can
not
admit
your
argument
in
this
matter
life
is
a
principle
that
needs
encouragement
and
a
man
of
family
has
more
incentives
to
live
and
usually
his
health
is
better
cared
for
than
a
single
man
that
is
all
we
rode
in
silence
for
some
time
i
finally
asked
nodding
toward
the
beautiful
enclosure
still
in
view
how
do
they
manage
about
this
business
do
they
practice
any
secrecy
of
course
he
replied
i
hope
you
do
not
think
we
live
in
open
and
shameless
lawlessness
usually
it
is
only
the
very
wealthy
who
indulge
in
such
and
they
try
to
seal
the
lips
of
servants
and
with
gold
but
it
does
not
always
work
it
is
in
the
nature
of
those
things
to
leak
out
and
if
one
of
these
creatures
is
found
out
what
then
i
asked
he
answered
with
some
severity
is
a
harsh
name
to
apply
to
women
some
of
whom
move
in
our
highest
circles
i
beg
your
pardon
call
them
what
you
like
but
tell
me
what
happens
when
there
is
an
are
they
denounced
ostracized
sat
upon
i
inquired
no
not
so
bad
as
that
said
he
of
course
there
is
a
scandal
but
it
makes
a
deal
of
difference
whether
the
scandal
is
a
famous
or
an
infamous
one
if
the
woman
standing
is
high
in
other
respects
if
she
has
money
political
influence
talent
attractiveness
there
is
very
little
made
of
it
or
if
society
feels
itself
particularly
insulted
she
may
conciliate
it
by
marrying
an
honest
man
whose
respectability
and
position
protect
her
what
does
an
honest
man
a
gentleman
ever
marry
such
a
woman
as
that
i
cried
frequently
and
sometimes
they
make
very
good
wives
but
it
is
risky
i
have
a
friend
a
capital
fellow
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
attract
such
a
woman
and
who
finally
yielded
to
her
persuasions
and
married
her
heavens
do
the
women
propose
certainly
when
they
choose
to
do
so
what
is
there
objectionable
in
that
i
made
no
reply
and
he
continued
my
friend
as
i
said
succumbed
to
her
pleadings
partly
as
i
believe
because
she
threw
herself
upon
his
mercy
though
she
is
a
beautiful
woman
and
he
might
have
been
fascinated
to
some
extent
she
told
him
that
his
love
and
protection
would
be
her
salvation
and
that
his
denial
of
her
would
result
in
her
total
ruin
and
that
for
his
sake
she
would
reform
her
life
he
is
both
chivalrous
and
tender
and
withal
a
little
romantic
and
he
consented
my
opinion
is
that
if
she
could
have
had
him
without
marriage
she
would
have
preferred
it
but
he
is
a
true
man
a
man
of
honor
women
of
her
sort
like
virtuous
men
and
seldom
marry
any
other
her
love
proved
to
be
an
ephemeral
passion
such
as
she
had
had
before
and
the
result
has
been
what
you
might
expect
though
claris
is
not
by
any
means
the
worst
woman
in
the
world
claris
i
exclaimed
ah
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
her
name
he
returned
in
some
confusion
and
i
had
forgotten
that
you
knew
her
well
yes
since
i
have
gone
so
far
it
is
my
friend
massilia
wife
that
i
have
been
speaking
of
in
some
respects
she
is
an
admirable
woman
but
she
has
broken
her
husband
heart
and
ruined
his
life
admirable
i
repeated
with
scorn
why
in
my
country
such
conduct
would
damn
a
woman
eternally
no
matter
what
angelic
qualities
she
might
possess
she
would
be
shown
no
quarter
in
any
society
save
the
very
lowest
and
how
about
her
counterpart
of
the
other
sex
asked
severnius
slyly
i
disregarded
this
and
returned
did
he
not
get
a
divorce
no
the
law
does
not
grant
a
divorce
in
such
a
case
there
was
where
claris
was
shrewder
than
her
husband
she
made
herself
safe
by
confessing
her
misdeeds
to
him
and
cajoling
him
into
marrying
her
in
spite
of
them
i
beg
your
pardon
but
what
a
fool
he
was
severnius
acquiesced
in
this
i
tried
to
dissuade
him
he
said
before
the
miserable
business
was
consummated
he
made
me
his
confidant
but
it
was
too
late
she
had
him
under
her
influence
another
silence
fell
upon
us
which
i
broke
by
asking
who
were
those
pretty
youngsters
we
saw
lounging
about
on
the
lawn
back
there
i
referred
to
several
handsome
young
men
whom
i
had
observed
strolling
through
the
beautiful
grounds
he
looked
at
me
in
evident
surprise
at
the
question
and
replied
why
those
are
some
of
the
professional
great
cæsar
ghost
yes
he
went
on
some
of
our
most
promising
youths
are
decoyed
into
those
places
it
is
a
distressing
business
a
hideous
business
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
similar
institutions
where
lovely
young
girls
are
the
victims
i
do
not
know
which
is
the
more
deplorable
sometimes
i
think
the
latter
is
a
tender
mother
would
wish
that
her
daughter
had
never
been
born
if
she
should
take
up
with
such
a
life
and
an
honorable
father
would
rather
see
his
son
gibbeted
than
to
find
him
inside
that
railing
i
should
think
so
i
responded
and
inquired
what
kind
of
standing
have
these
men
in
the
outside
world
about
the
same
that
a
leper
would
have
they
are
ignored
and
despised
by
the
very
women
who
court
their
caresses
here
in
fact
they
are
on
a
level
with
the
common
paid
courtesan
the
lowest
rank
there
is
i
have
often
thought
it
a
curious
thing
that
either
men
or
women
should
so
utterly
despise
these
poor
instruments
of
their
sensual
delights
my
friend
saw
that
i
was
too
much
shocked
to
moralize
on
the
subject
and
he
presently
began
to
explain
and
to
modify
the
facts
a
little
you
see
these
fellows
when
they
begin
this
sort
of
thing
are
mostly
mere
boys
with
the
down
scarcely
started
on
their
chins
in
the
susceptible
impressionable
stage
when
a
woman
honeyed
words
ay
her
touch
even
may
turn
the
world
upside
down
to
them
the
life
of
course
has
its
attractions
money
and
luxury
to
say
nothing
of
the
flattery
which
is
sweeter
still
few
if
any
adopt
it
deliberately
often
they
are
wilily
drawn
into
outside
for
the
misery
of
it
is
that
good
society
as
i
have
said
before
throws
its
cloak
around
these
specious
beguilers
and
the
unfortunate
dupe
does
not
dream
whither
he
is
being
led
youth
has
such
a
sincere
faith
in
beauty
and
grace
and
feminine
charm
sometimes
reverses
and
disaster
of
one
kind
or
another
or
a
cheerless
home
environment
drive
a
young
man
into
seeking
refuge
and
lethean
pleasures
here
it
is
a
form
of
dissipation
similar
to
the
drink
habit
only
a
thousand
times
worse
worse
i
cried
it
is
infernal
diabolical
damnable
and
it
is
woman
who
accomplishes
this
horrible
ruin
and
is
in
society
which
if
too
flagrantly
outraged
will
not
forgive
her
unless
she
marries
some
good
man
o
not
always
that
protested
severnius
the
unlucky
sinner
sometimes
recovers
caste
by
a
course
of
penitence
by
multiplying
her
subscriptions
to
charities
and
by
costly
to
the
aforesaid
outraged
society
what
sort
of
i
asked
well
an
entertainment
perhaps
something
superb
something
out
of
the
common
or
may
be
a
voyage
in
her
private
yacht
bait
of
that
sort
is
too
tempting
for
any
but
the
high
and
mighty
the
real
aristocrats
to
withstand
the
simply
respectable
but
who
are
a
little
below
her
level
in
point
of
wealth
position
or
ancestry
fall
into
her
net
i
have
observed
that
a
woman
who
has
forfeited
her
place
in
the
highest
rank
of
society
usually
begins
her
reascent
by
clutching
hold
of
the
skirts
of
honest
folk
who
are
flattered
by
her
condescension
and
whose
sturdy
arms
assist
her
to
rise
again
i
have
observed
the
same
thing
myself
i
rejoined
but
he
had
not
finished
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
he
went
on
if
you
were
to
reveal
the
secret
of
your
to
a
woman
of
this
kind
she
would
probably
seize
upon
it
as
a
means
of
salvation
she
would
have
one
constructed
on
a
large
and
handsome
scale
and
invite
a
party
to
accompany
her
on
an
excursion
to
the
earth
and
though
she
were
the
worst
of
her
class
every
mother
son
and
daughter
of
us
would
accept
for
none
of
us
hold
our
at
a
higher
figure
than
that
i
imagine
yes
severnius
you
do
i
replied
emphatically
i
beg
your
pardon
i
would
knock
off
a
good
deal
for
a
visit
to
your
planet
he
said
laughing
by
this
time
we
had
left
cupid
gardens
far
behind
the
road
bent
in
again
toward
the
river
which
we
presently
crossed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
dreadful
things
i
had
just
listened
to
i
think
i
should
have
been
in
transports
over
the
serene
loveliness
of
the
prospect
around
us
the
view
was
especially
fine
from
the
summit
of
the
bridge
it
is
a
high
bridge
for
the
gyro
is
navigated
by
great
and
schooners
severnius
bade
the
driver
stop
a
moment
that
we
might
contemplate
the
scene
but
i
had
little
heart
for
its
beauties
and
yet
i
can
recall
the
picture
now
with
extraordinary
clearness
the
river
has
many
windings
and
the
woods
often
hide
it
from
view
but
it
reappears
again
and
again
afar
off
in
green
meadows
and
yellowing
fields
opalescent
jewels
in
gold
or
emerald
setting
here
and
there
in
the
distance
white
sails
were
moving
as
if
on
land
far
beyond
were
vague
mountain
outlines
and
over
all
the
tender
of
the
sky
the
sweetness
of
it
contrasted
with
the
picture
newly
wrought
in
my
mind
saddened
me
some
distance
up
the
river
on
the
other
side
we
passed
an
old
dilapidated
villa
or
group
of
buildings
jumbled
together
without
regard
to
effect
evidently
but
yet
picturesque
they
were
half
hidden
in
mammoth
forest
trees
that
had
never
been
trimmed
or
trained
but
spread
their
enormous
limbs
wheresoever
they
would
unpruned
shrubbery
and
trailing
vines
rioted
over
the
uneven
lawn
and
the
rank
windblown
grass
too
long
to
stand
erect
lay
in
waves
like
a
hair
in
a
general
way
the
lawn
sloped
downward
toward
the
road
so
that
we
could
see
nearly
the
whole
of
it
over
the
high
and
ugly
board
fence
which
inclosed
it
under
the
trees
a
little
way
back
i
observed
a
group
of
young
girls
lolling
in
hammocks
and
idling
in
rustic
chairs
they
caught
sight
of
us
and
sprang
up
laughing
boistterously
i
thought
they
were
going
to
run
away
in
pretended
and
playful
flight
but
instead
they
came
toward
us
and
blew
kisses
at
us
off
their
fingers
i
looked
at
severnius
what
does
this
mean
i
asked
why
he
said
and
the
blush
mantled
his
handsome
face
again
this
place
is
the
counterpart
of
cupid
gardens
a
resort
for
men
i
thought
so
i
replied
he
remarked
i
hope
you
will
not
form
too
bad
an
opinion
of
us
my
friend
you
have
learned
what
horrible
evils
exist
among
us
but
i
assure
you
that
the
sum
total
of
the
people
who
practice
them
constitutes
but
a
small
proportion
of
our
population
and
the
good
people
here
the
great
majority
look
upon
these
things
with
the
same
aversion
and
disgust
that
you
do
and
are
doing
their
best
or
they
think
they
are
to
abolish
them
how
by
legislation
i
asked
partly
but
more
through
education
our
preachers
and
teachers
have
taken
the
matter
up
but
they
are
handicapped
by
the
delicacy
of
the
question
and
the
privacy
involved
in
it
which
seems
to
hinder
discussion
even
and
to
forestall
advice
though
this
is
the
only
way
to
accomplish
anything
i
think
i
have
very
little
faith
in
legislative
measures
against
secret
vices
it
is
like
trying
to
dam
a
stream
which
can
not
be
dammed
but
must
break
out
somewhere
i
am
convinced
that
my
friends
the
caskians
have
solved
the
question
in
the
only
possible
way
by
elevating
and
purifying
the
marriage
relation
i
hope
some
good
may
be
accomplished
by
the
visit
of
the
few
who
are
coming
here
will
they
preach
or
lecture
i
asked
with
what
seemed
to
me
a
moment
later
to
be
stupid
simplicity
o
no
replied
severnius
with
the
same
air
of
modest
but
emphatic
protest
which
they
themselves
would
have
doubtless
assumed
had
the
question
been
put
to
them
it
was
simply
their
personal
influence
i
had
reference
to
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
make
you
understand
but
their
presence
always
seemed
to
me
like
a
disinfectant
of
evil
with
myself
when
i
was
among
them
all
the
good
that
was
in
me
responded
to
their
nobility
the
evil
in
me
slept
i
suppose
i
made
a
skeptical
rejoinder
to
the
implication
in
his
last
sentence
for
to
me
he
seemed
entirely
devoid
of
evil
and
we
finished
the
drive
in
silence
chapter
new
friends
having
established
his
equality
with
class
after
class
of
those
with
whom
he
would
live
well
he
still
finds
certain
others
before
whom
he
can
not
possess
himself
because
they
have
somewhat
fairer
somewhat
grander
somewhat
purer
which
extorts
homage
of
emerson
it
is
scarcely
egotistical
for
me
to
say
that
i
was
much
sought
after
not
only
by
the
citizens
of
thursia
but
by
many
distinguished
people
from
other
cities
and
countries
among
them
were
many
men
and
women
of
great
scientific
learning
who
made
me
feel
that
i
ought
to
have
provided
myself
with
a
better
equipment
of
knowledge
relative
to
my
own
world
before
taking
my
ambitious
journey
to
mars
they
were
exceedingly
polite
but
i
fear
they
were
much
disappointed
in
many
of
my
hazy
responses
to
their
eager
questionings
i
learned
by
this
experience
the
great
value
of
exact
information
in
a
country
like
ours
where
so
much
and
so
many
sorts
of
knowledge
are
in
the
air
a
person
is
apt
unless
he
is
a
student
of
some
particular
thing
to
get
little
more
than
impressions
there
was
i
an
average
let
me
hope
american
citizen
at
the
mercy
of
inquisitive
experts
in
a
hundred
different
arts
and
trades
concerning
which
in
the
main
my
ideas
might
be
conservatively
described
as
general
you
may
imagine
how
unsatisfactory
this
was
to
people
anxious
to
know
about
our
progress
in
physics
and
chemistry
botany
and
the
great
family
of
ologies
or
rather
about
our
processes
in
developing
the
principles
of
these
great
sciences
with
the
astronomers
and
the
electricians
i
got
along
all
right
and
i
was
also
able
to
make
myself
interesting
or
so
i
fancied
in
describing
our
social
life
our
educational
and
political
institutions
and
our
various
forms
of
religion
our
modes
of
dress
were
a
matter
of
great
curiosity
to
most
of
these
people
and
i
was
often
asked
to
exhibit
my
terrestrial
garments
it
was
when
the
crowd
of
outside
visitors
was
at
its
thickest
that
the
caskians
arrived
and
as
their
stay
was
brief
covering
only
two
days
you
may
suppose
that
we
did
not
advance
far
on
the
road
to
mutual
acquaintance
but
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
not
a
strangeness
between
us
after
we
had
once
clasped
hands
and
looked
into
each
other
eyes
it
might
have
been
partly
due
to
my
own
preparedness
to
meet
them
with
confidence
and
trust
but
more
i
think
to
their
singular
freedom
from
the
conventional
barriers
with
which
we
hedge
round
our
selfness
their
souls
spoke
to
mine
and
mine
answered
back
and
the
compact
of
friendship
was
sealed
in
a
glance
i
can
not
hope
to
give
you
a
very
clear
idea
of
their
perfect
naturalness
their
perfect
dignity
their
kindliness
or
their
delightful
gayety
before
which
stiffness
formality
ceremony
were
borne
down
dissolved
as
sunshine
dissolves
frost
no
menstruum
is
so
wonderful
as
the
quality
of
merriment
take
it
on
any
plane
of
life
when
it
reaches
the
highest
and
is
subtilized
by
cultured
and
refined
intellects
it
creates
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
most
frigid
autocrat
of
society
and
of
learning
too
must
thaw
the
haughtiest
dame
can
not
keep
her
countenance
in
the
face
of
this
playful
spirit
toying
with
her
frills
the
veriest
old
hibernating
in
mouldy
archæological
chambers
can
not
resist
the
blithesome
thought
which
dares
to
illumine
his
antique
treasures
with
a
touch
of
mirth
i
was
struck
by
clytia
beauty
which
in
some
ways
seemed
finer
than
elodia
the
two
women
were
about
the
same
height
and
figure
but
clytia
coloring
was
pure
white
and
black
except
for
the
healthy
carmine
of
her
lips
and
occasional
fluctuations
of
the
rose
tint
in
her
cheeks
i
was
present
when
they
first
met
in
the
elodia
rose
to
her
full
stature
armed
with
her
stateliest
manner
but
with
a
gracious
sense
of
hospitality
upon
her
i
marked
with
pleasure
that
clytia
did
not
rush
upon
her
with
any
exuberance
of
gladness
as
some
women
would
have
done
in
a
first
meeting
with
their
sister
for
that
would
have
disgusted
elodia
and
driven
her
to
still
higher
ground
how
curious
are
our
mental
attitudes
toward
our
associates
and
how
quickly
adjusted
here
had
i
been
in
house
enjoying
her
companionship
if
not
her
friendship
for
months
and
yet
you
see
i
secretly
did
not
wish
any
advantage
to
be
on
her
side
it
could
not
have
been
disloyalty
for
the
impulse
was
swift
and
involuntary
i
would
like
to
suppose
that
it
sprang
from
my
instantaneous
recognition
of
the
higher
nature
but
it
did
not
it
was
due
no
doubt
to
a
fear
for
the
more
timid
one
as
i
fancied
it
to
be
i
had
a
momentary
sensation
as
of
wanting
to
back
clytia
knowing
how
formidable
my
proud
hostess
could
be
and
i
feared
would
be
but
the
beautiful
caskian
did
not
need
my
support
she
was
not
timid
i
never
saw
anything
finer
than
her
manner
the
most
consummate
woman
of
the
world
could
not
have
met
the
situation
with
more
dignity
and
grace
and
with
not
half
so
much
simplicity
her
limpid
dark
eyes
met
elodia
ones
and
the
result
was
mutual
respect
with
a
slight
giving
on
elodia
part
i
felt
that
i
had
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
seen
a
perfect
woman
a
woman
of
such
fine
proportions
of
such
nice
balance
that
her
noble
virtues
and
high
intelligence
did
not
make
her
forget
even
the
smallest
amenities
she
kept
in
hand
every
faculty
of
her
triple
being
so
that
she
was
able
to
use
each
in
its
turn
and
to
give
to
everything
about
her
its
due
appreciation
she
had
as
balzac
says
the
gift
of
admiration
and
of
comprehension
that
which
her
glance
rested
upon
that
which
her
ear
listened
to
responded
with
all
that
was
in
them
i
thought
it
a
wonderful
power
that
could
so
bring
out
the
innate
beauties
and
values
of
even
inanimate
things
elodia
eyes
rested
upon
her
from
time
to
time
with
a
keen
and
questioning
interest
i
think
that
among
other
things
she
was
surprised
as
i
was
at
the
elegance
the
style
even
of
clytia
dress
although
there
is
very
little
fashion
on
that
planet
as
we
know
the
word
there
is
a
great
deal
of
style
i
had
speedily
mastered
all
its
subtle
gradations
and
could
place
a
woman
with
considerable
certainty
by
let
me
say
her
manner
of
wearing
her
clothes
if
not
the
clothes
themselves
i
have
never
studied
woman
apparel
in
detail
it
always
seems
as
mysterious
to
me
as
woman
herself
does
but
i
have
a
good
eye
for
effects
in
that
line
as
most
men
have
and
i
knew
that
clytia
costume
was
above
criticism
she
wore
just
where
they
seemed
to
be
needed
as
the
keystone
is
needed
in
an
arch
a
few
fine
gems
i
could
not
conceive
of
her
putting
them
on
to
arouse
the
envy
of
any
other
woman
or
to
enhance
her
personal
charms
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
she
dressed
well
as
another
would
sing
well
sight
is
the
sense
we
value
most
but
how
often
is
it
offended
you
can
estimate
the
quality
of
a
woman
by
the
shade
of
green
she
chooses
for
her
gown
and
there
is
poetry
in
the
fit
of
a
gown
as
there
is
in
the
color
of
it
clytia
knew
these
things
these
higher
principles
of
dress
as
the
nightingale
knows
its
song
through
the
effortless
working
of
perfected
faculties
but
not
she
alone
my
description
of
her
will
answer
for
the
others
the
caskians
are
a
people
you
see
who
neglect
nothing
we
upon
the
earth
are
in
the
habit
of
saying
with
regretful
cadence
life
is
short
it
is
because
our
life
is
all
out
of
proportion
we
are
trying
to
cheat
time
we
stuff
too
much
plunder
into
our
bags
and
discriminate
against
the
best
clytia
and
calypso
and
their
friend
ariadne
a
young
girl
stayed
with
us
throughout
their
visit
the
others
of
their
party
were
entertained
elsewhere
on
each
of
the
two
evenings
they
were
with
us
elodia
invited
a
considerable
company
of
people
not
so
many
as
to
crowd
the
rooms
nor
so
few
as
to
make
them
seem
empty
those
gatherings
were
remarkable
events
i
imagine
in
a
good
many
lives
they
were
in
mine
at
the
close
of
each
evening
i
retired
to
my
room
in
a
state
of
high
mental
intoxication
my
unaccustomed
brain
had
taken
too
large
a
draught
of
intellectual
champagne
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
it
was
with
a
sense
of
fatigue
of
mind
the
same
as
one
feels
fatigue
of
body
the
day
after
extraordinary
feats
of
physical
exertion
but
not
so
the
guests
who
came
down
into
the
breakfast
room
as
radiant
as
ever
and
in
full
possession
of
themselves
with
them
fatigue
seemed
impossible
we
do
not
know
because
we
are
so
poorly
trained
the
wonderful
elasticity
of
a
human
being
in
all
his
parts
we
often
see
it
exemplified
in
single
faculties
the
voice
of
a
singer
the
legs
of
a
runner
the
brain
of
a
lawyer
the
spirit
of
a
religionist
but
as
i
have
said
before
we
are
all
out
of
proportion
and
any
slight
strain
upon
an
unused
faculty
gives
us
the
cramp
the
fact
is
the
most
of
us
are
cripples
in
some
sense
we
lack
a
moral
leg
a
spiritual
arm
there
are
parts
of
us
that
are
neglected
withered
paralyzed
one
thing
in
the
caskians
which
especially
pleased
me
and
which
i
am
sure
made
a
strong
and
favorable
impression
upon
elodia
too
was
that
their
conduct
and
conversation
never
lacked
the
vital
human
interest
without
which
all
philosophy
is
cold
and
all
religion
is
asceticism
it
appeared
that
these
people
had
taken
the
long
journey
not
only
to
meet
me
but
that
they
might
extend
to
me
in
person
a
cordial
invitation
to
visit
their
country
severnius
warmly
urged
me
to
accept
assuring
me
with
unmistakable
sincerity
that
it
would
give
him
pleasure
to
put
his
purse
at
my
disposal
for
the
expenses
of
the
journey
i
having
brought
up
this
point
as
a
rather
serious
obstacle
as
it
would
only
add
one
more
item
to
the
great
sum
of
my
indebtedness
to
my
friend
i
took
him
at
his
word
and
gave
my
promise
to
the
caskians
to
make
the
journey
to
lunismar
sometime
in
the
near
future
and
with
that
they
left
us
and
left
behind
them
matter
for
conversation
for
many
a
day
chapter
a
talk
with
elodia
it
behoveth
us
also
to
consider
the
nature
of
him
that
seneca
the
longer
i
delayed
my
visit
to
caskia
the
more
difficult
it
became
for
me
to
tear
myself
away
from
thursia
you
may
guess
the
lodestar
that
held
me
back
it
was
as
if
i
were
attached
to
elodia
by
an
invisible
chain
which
alas
in
no
way
hindered
her
free
movements
because
she
was
unconscious
of
its
existence
sometimes
she
treated
me
with
a
charmingly
frank
and
at
other
times
her
manner
was
simply
almost
coldly
courteous
which
i
very
well
knew
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
more
than
usually
absorbed
in
her
business
or
official
affairs
she
was
never
cold
for
a
purpose
any
more
than
she
was
fascinating
for
a
purpose
she
was
singularly
sincere
affecting
neither
smiles
nor
frowns
neither
affability
nor
severity
from
remote
or
calculating
motives
in
brief
she
did
not
employ
her
feminine
graces
her
sexpower
as
speculating
capital
in
social
commerce
the
social
conditions
in
thursia
do
not
demand
that
women
shall
pose
in
a
conciliatory
attitude
toward
men
upon
whose
favor
their
dearest
privileges
hang
marriage
not
being
an
economic
necessity
with
them
they
are
released
from
certain
sordid
motives
which
often
actuate
women
in
our
world
in
their
frantic
efforts
to
avert
the
appalling
catastrophe
of
missing
a
husband
and
they
are
at
liberty
to
operate
their
matrimonial
campaigns
upon
other
grounds
i
do
not
say
higher
grounds
because
that
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
one
base
factor
in
the
marriage
problem
the
ignoble
scheming
to
secure
the
means
of
living
as
represented
in
a
husband
is
eliminated
and
the
spirit
of
woman
is
that
much
more
free
we
men
have
a
feeling
that
we
are
liable
at
any
time
to
be
entrapped
into
matrimony
by
a
mask
of
cunning
and
deceit
which
heredity
and
long
practice
enable
women
to
use
with
such
amazing
skill
that
few
can
escape
it
we
expect
to
be
caught
with
chaff
like
fractious
colts
coquetting
with
the
halter
and
secretly
not
unwilling
to
be
caught
another
thing
woman
freedom
to
propose
which
struck
me
as
monstrous
takes
away
the
reproach
of
her
remaining
single
the
supposition
being
as
in
the
case
of
a
bachelor
that
it
is
a
matter
of
choice
with
her
it
saves
her
the
dread
of
having
it
said
that
she
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
marry
courtship
in
thursia
may
lack
some
of
the
tantalizing
uncertainties
which
give
it
zest
with
us
but
marriage
also
is
robbed
of
many
doubts
and
misgivings
still
i
could
not
accustom
myself
with
any
feeling
of
comfort
to
the
situation
there
the
idea
of
masculine
and
womanly
dependence
being
too
thoroughly
ingrained
in
my
nature
elodia
of
course
did
many
things
and
held
many
opinions
of
which
i
did
not
approve
but
i
believed
in
her
innate
nobility
and
attributed
her
defects
to
a
pernicious
civilization
and
a
government
which
did
not
exercise
its
paternal
right
to
cherish
and
restrain
and
protect
the
weaker
sex
as
they
should
be
cherished
and
restrained
and
protected
and
how
charming
and
how
reliable
she
was
in
spite
of
her
defects
she
had
an
atomic
weight
upon
which
you
could
depend
as
upon
any
other
known
quantity
her
presence
was
a
stimulus
that
quickened
the
faculties
and
intensified
the
emotions
at
least
i
may
speak
for
myself
she
awoke
new
feelings
and
aroused
new
powers
within
me
her
life
had
made
her
practical
but
not
prosaic
she
had
imagination
and
poetic
feeling
there
were
times
when
her
beautiful
countenance
was
touched
with
the
grandeur
of
lofty
thought
and
again
with
the
shifting
lights
of
a
playful
humor
or
the
flashings
of
a
keen
but
kindly
wit
she
had
a
laugh
that
mellowed
the
heart
as
if
she
took
you
into
her
confidence
it
is
a
mark
of
extreme
favor
when
your
superior
or
a
beautiful
woman
admits
you
to
the
intimacy
of
a
cordial
laugh
even
her
smiles
which
i
used
to
lie
in
wait
for
and
often
tried
to
provoke
were
not
the
mere
froth
of
a
light
and
careless
temperament
they
had
a
significance
like
speech
though
she
was
so
busy
and
though
she
knew
so
well
how
to
make
the
moments
count
she
could
be
idle
when
she
chose
deliciously
luxuriously
idle
like
one
who
will
not
fritter
away
his
pence
but
upon
occasion
spends
his
guineas
handsomely
at
the
dinner
hour
she
always
gave
us
of
her
best
her
varied
life
supplied
her
with
much
material
for
conversation
nothing
worth
noticing
ever
escaped
her
in
the
life
and
conduct
of
people
about
her
she
was
fond
of
anecdote
and
could
garnish
the
simplest
story
with
an
exquisite
grace
upon
one
of
her
idle
days
a
day
when
severnius
happened
not
to
be
at
home
she
took
up
her
parasol
in
the
hall
after
we
had
had
luncheon
and
gave
me
a
glance
which
said
come
with
me
if
you
like
and
we
went
out
and
strolled
through
the
grounds
together
her
manner
had
not
a
touch
of
coquetry
i
might
have
been
simply
another
woman
she
might
have
been
simply
another
man
but
i
was
so
stupid
as
to
essay
little
gallantries
such
as
had
been
in
fact
a
part
of
my
youthful
education
she
either
did
not
observe
them
or
ignored
them
i
could
not
tell
which
once
i
put
out
my
hand
to
assist
her
over
a
ridiculously
narrow
streamlet
and
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
gesture
but
reefed
her
skirts
or
draperies
with
her
own
unoccupied
hand
and
stepped
lightly
across
again
when
we
were
about
to
ascend
an
abrupt
hill
i
courteously
offered
her
my
arm
o
no
i
thank
you
she
said
i
have
two
which
balance
me
very
well
when
i
climb
you
are
a
strange
woman
i
exclaimed
with
a
blush
am
i
she
said
lifting
her
brows
well
i
suppose
or
rather
you
suppose
that
i
am
the
product
of
my
ancestry
and
my
training
you
are
in
some
respects
i
assented
and
then
i
added
i
have
often
tried
to
fancy
what
effect
our
civilization
would
have
had
upon
you
what
effect
do
you
think
it
would
have
had
she
asked
with
quite
an
unusual
i
might
say
earthly
curiosity
i
dare
not
tell
you
i
replied
thrilling
with
the
felicity
of
a
talk
so
personal
the
first
i
had
ever
had
with
her
why
not
she
demanded
with
a
side
glance
at
me
from
under
her
shade
it
would
be
taking
too
great
a
liberty
but
if
i
pardon
that
there
was
an
archness
in
her
smile
which
was
altogether
womanly
what
a
grand
opportunity
i
thought
for
saying
some
of
the
things
i
had
so
often
wanted
to
say
to
her
but
i
hesitated
turning
hot
and
then
cold
really
i
said
i
can
not
i
should
flatter
you
and
you
would
not
like
that
for
the
first
time
i
saw
her
face
crimson
to
the
temples
that
would
be
very
bad
taste
she
replied
flattery
being
the
last
resort
when
it
is
found
that
there
is
nothing
in
one
to
compliment
silence
is
better
you
have
commendable
tact
pardon
my
stupid
blunder
i
cried
you
can
not
think
i
meant
that
flattery
is
exaggerated
absurd
unmeaning
praise
and
no
praise
the
highest
the
best
could
do
you
justice
could
she
broke
in
with
a
disdainful
laugh
a
woman
can
always
compel
a
pretty
speech
from
a
man
you
see
even
in
mars
you
did
not
compel
it
i
rejoined
earnestly
if
i
but
dared
if
you
would
allow
me
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
how
highly
i
regard
she
made
a
gesture
which
cut
short
my
eloquence
and
we
walked
on
in
silence
whenever
there
has
been
a
disturbance
in
the
moral
atmosphere
there
is
nothing
like
silence
to
restore
the
equilibrium
i
watching
furtively
saw
the
slight
cloud
pass
from
her
face
leaving
the
intelligent
serenity
it
usually
wore
but
still
she
did
not
speak
however
there
was
nothing
ominous
in
that
she
was
never
troubled
with
an
uneasy
desire
to
keep
conversation
going
on
top
of
the
hill
there
were
benches
and
we
sat
down
it
was
one
of
those
still
afternoons
in
summer
when
nature
seems
to
be
taking
a
siesta
overhead
it
was
like
the
heart
of
a
rose
the
soft
white
cottony
clouds
we
often
see
suspended
in
our
azure
ether
floated
as
soft
as
white
as
fleecy
in
the
pink
skies
of
mars
elodia
closed
her
parasol
and
laid
it
across
her
lap
and
leaned
her
head
back
against
the
tree
in
whose
shade
we
were
it
was
an
acute
pleasure
a
rapture
indeed
to
sit
so
near
to
her
and
alone
with
her
out
of
hearing
of
all
the
world
but
she
was
calmly
unconscious
her
gaze
wandering
dreamily
through
lids
over
the
wide
landscape
which
included
forests
and
fields
and
meadows
and
many
windings
of
the
river
for
we
had
a
high
point
of
observation
i
presently
broke
the
silence
with
a
bold
perhaps
an
inexcusable
question
elodia
do
you
intend
ever
to
marry
it
was
a
kind
of
challenge
and
i
held
myself
rigid
waiting
for
her
answer
which
did
not
come
immediately
she
turned
her
eyes
toward
me
slowly
without
moving
her
head
and
our
glances
met
and
gradually
retreated
as
two
opposing
forces
might
meet
and
retreat
neither
conquering
neither
vanquished
hers
went
back
into
space
and
she
replied
at
last
as
if
to
space
as
if
the
question
had
come
not
from
me
alone
but
from
all
the
voices
that
urge
to
matrimony
why
should
i
marry
because
you
are
a
woman
i
answered
promptly
ah
her
lip
curled
with
a
faint
smile
your
reason
is
very
general
but
why
limit
it
at
all
why
not
say
because
i
am
one
of
a
pair
which
should
be
joined
together
the
question
was
not
cynical
but
serious
i
scrutinized
her
face
closely
to
make
sure
of
that
before
answering
i
know
i
replied
that
here
in
mars
there
is
held
to
be
no
difference
in
the
nature
and
requirements
of
the
sexes
but
it
is
a
false
hypothesis
there
is
a
difference
a
vast
difference
all
my
knowledge
of
humanity
my
experience
and
observation
prove
it
prove
it
to
you
no
doubt
she
returned
but
not
to
me
because
my
experience
and
observation
have
been
the
reverse
of
yours
will
you
kindly
tell
me
she
added
why
you
think
i
should
wish
to
marry
any
more
than
a
man
or
what
reasons
can
be
urged
upon
a
woman
more
than
upon
a
man
an
overpowering
sense
of
helplessness
fell
upon
me
as
when
one
has
reached
the
limits
of
another
understanding
and
is
unable
to
clear
the
ground
for
further
argument
o
elodia
i
can
not
talk
to
you
i
replied
it
is
true
as
you
say
that
our
conclusions
are
based
upon
diverse
premises
we
are
so
wide
apart
in
our
views
on
this
subject
that
what
i
would
say
must
seem
to
you
the
merest
cant
and
sentiment
i
think
not
you
are
an
honest
man
she
rejoined
with
an
encouraging
smile
and
i
am
greatly
interested
in
your
philosophy
of
marriage
i
acknowledged
her
compliment
well
i
began
desperately
letting
the
words
tumble
out
as
they
would
it
is
woman
nature
as
i
understand
it
to
care
a
great
deal
about
being
loved
loved
wholly
and
entirely
by
one
man
who
is
worthy
of
her
love
and
to
be
united
to
him
in
the
sacred
bonds
of
marriage
to
have
a
husband
children
to
assume
the
sweet
obligations
of
family
ties
and
to
gather
to
herself
the
tenderest
and
purest
affections
humanity
can
know
is
surely
indisputably
the
best
the
highest
noblest
province
of
woman
and
not
of
man
these
things
mean
the
same
to
men
of
course
i
replied
though
in
lesser
degree
it
is
man
office
with
us
to
buffet
with
the
world
to
wrest
the
means
of
livelihood
of
comfort
luxury
from
the
grudging
hand
of
fortune
it
is
the
highest
grace
of
woman
that
she
accepts
these
things
at
his
hands
she
honors
him
in
accepting
as
he
honors
her
in
bestowing
i
was
aware
that
i
was
indulging
in
platitudes
but
the
platitudes
of
earth
are
novelties
in
mars
her
eyes
took
a
long
leap
from
mine
to
the
vague
horizon
line
it
is
very
strange
she
said
this
distinction
you
make
i
can
not
understand
it
at
all
it
seems
to
me
that
this
love
we
are
talking
about
is
simply
one
of
the
strong
instincts
implanted
in
our
common
nature
it
is
an
essential
of
our
being
marriage
is
not
it
is
a
social
institution
and
just
why
it
is
incumbent
upon
one
sex
more
than
upon
the
other
or
why
it
is
more
desirable
for
one
sex
than
the
other
is
inconceivable
to
me
if
either
a
man
or
a
woman
desires
the
ties
you
speak
of
or
if
one
has
the
vanity
to
wish
to
found
a
respectable
family
then
of
course
marriage
is
a
necessity
made
so
by
our
social
and
political
laws
it
is
a
luxury
we
may
have
if
we
pay
the
price
i
was
shocked
at
this
reasoning
and
cried
o
how
can
a
woman
say
that
have
you
no
tenderness
elodia
no
of
these
ties
and
affections
which
i
have
always
been
taught
are
so
precious
to
woman
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
leaning
forward
a
little
clasped
her
hands
about
her
knees
let
us
not
make
it
personal
she
said
i
admitted
that
these
things
belong
to
our
common
nature
and
i
do
not
of
course
except
myself
but
i
repeat
that
marriage
is
a
convention
and
i
am
not
conventional
as
to
that
i
retorted
all
the
things
that
pertain
to
civilization
all
the
steps
which
have
ever
been
taken
in
the
direction
of
progress
are
conventions
our
clothing
our
houses
our
religions
arts
our
good
manners
and
we
are
bound
to
accept
every
that
makes
for
the
betterment
of
society
as
though
it
were
a
revelation
from
god
i
confess
that
this
thought
was
the
fruit
of
my
brief
intercourse
with
the
caskians
who
hold
that
there
is
a
divine
power
continually
operating
upon
human
consciousness
not
disclosing
miracles
but
enlarging
and
perfecting
human
perceptions
i
was
thinking
of
this
when
elodia
suddenly
put
the
question
to
me
are
you
married
no
i
am
not
i
replied
the
inquiry
was
not
agreeable
to
me
it
implied
that
she
had
been
hitherto
altogether
too
indifferent
as
to
my
eligibility
never
having
concerned
herself
to
ascertain
the
fact
before
well
you
are
perhaps
older
than
i
am
she
said
and
you
have
doubtless
had
amours
i
was
as
much
astounded
by
the
frankness
of
this
inquiry
as
you
can
be
and
blushed
like
a
girl
she
withdrew
her
eyes
from
my
face
with
a
faint
smile
and
covered
the
question
by
another
you
intend
to
marry
i
suppose
i
do
certainly
i
replied
the
resolution
crystallizing
on
the
instant
she
drew
a
long
sigh
well
i
do
not
i
am
so
comfortable
as
i
am
she
patted
the
ground
with
her
slipper
toe
i
do
not
wish
to
impose
new
conditions
upon
myself
i
simply
accept
my
life
as
it
comes
to
me
why
should
i
voluntarily
burden
myself
with
a
family
and
all
the
possible
cares
and
sorrows
which
attend
the
marriage
state
if
i
cast
a
prophetic
eye
into
the
future
what
am
i
likely
to
see
let
us
say
a
lovely
daughter
dying
of
some
frightful
malady
an
idolized
son
squandering
my
wealth
and
going
to
ruin
a
husband
in
whom
i
no
longer
delight
but
to
whom
i
am
bound
by
a
hundred
intricate
ties
impossible
to
sever
i
think
i
am
not
prepared
to
take
the
future
on
trust
to
so
great
an
extent
why
should
the
free
wish
for
fetters
affection
and
sympathy
are
good
things
indispensable
things
in
fact
but
i
find
them
in
my
friends
and
for
this
other
matter
this
need
of
love
passion
sentiment
is
peculiarly
ephemeral
in
its
impulses
notwithstanding
that
it
has
such
an
insistent
vitality
in
the
human
heart
may
be
satisfied
without
entailing
such
tremendous
responsibilities
i
looked
at
her
aghast
did
she
know
what
she
was
saying
did
she
mean
what
her
words
implied
you
wrong
yourself
elodia
said
i
those
are
the
sentiments
the
arguments
of
a
selfish
person
of
a
mean
and
cowardly
spirit
and
you
have
none
of
those
attributes
you
are
strong
courageous
generous
you
mistake
me
she
interrupted
i
am
entirely
selfish
i
do
not
wish
to
disturb
my
present
agreeable
pose
tell
me
what
is
it
that
usually
prompts
people
to
marry
why
love
of
course
i
answered
well
you
are
liable
to
fall
in
love
with
my
maid
not
after
having
seen
her
mistress
i
ejaculated
if
she
happens
to
possess
a
face
or
figure
that
draws
your
masculine
eye
she
went
on
the
rising
color
in
her
cheek
responding
to
my
audacious
compliment
though
there
may
be
nothing
in
common
between
you
socially
intellectually
or
spiritually
what
would
be
the
result
of
such
a
marriage
based
upon
simple
i
had
known
many
such
marriages
and
was
familiar
with
the
results
but
i
did
not
answer
we
tacitly
dropped
the
subject
and
our
two
minds
wandered
away
as
they
would
on
separate
currents
she
was
the
first
to
break
this
second
silence
i
can
conceive
of
a
marriage
she
said
which
would
not
become
burdensome
any
more
than
our
best
friendships
become
burdensome
beside
the
attraction
on
the
physical
plane
which
i
believe
is
very
necessary
there
should
exist
all
the
higher
affinities
i
should
want
my
husband
to
be
my
most
delightful
companion
able
to
keep
my
liking
and
to
command
my
respect
and
confidence
as
i
should
hope
to
his
but
i
fear
that
is
ideal
the
ideal
is
only
the
highest
real
i
answered
the
ideal
is
always
possible
remotely
she
said
with
a
laugh
the
chances
are
many
against
it
but
even
if
one
were
to
fall
short
a
little
in
respect
to
husband
or
wife
i
have
often
observed
that
there
are
compensations
springing
out
of
the
relation
in
other
ways
i
returned
you
mean
children
o
yes
that
is
true
when
all
goes
well
i
will
tell
you
she
added
her
voice
dropping
to
the
tone
one
instantly
recognizes
as
confidential
that
i
am
educating
several
children
in
some
of
our
best
schools
and
that
i
mean
to
provide
for
them
with
sufficient
liberality
when
they
come
of
age
so
you
see
i
have
thrown
hostages
to
fortune
and
shall
probably
reap
a
harvest
of
gratitude
in
place
of
filial
affection
she
laughed
with
a
touch
of
mockery
i
suppose
every
one
is
familiar
with
the
experience
of
having
things
facts
bits
of
knowledge
come
to
him
as
we
say
something
came
to
me
and
froze
the
marrow
in
my
bones
elodia
i
ventured
you
asked
me
a
very
plain
question
a
moment
ago
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
ask
you
the
same
have
you
had
amours
the
expression
of
her
face
changed
slightly
which
might
have
been
due
to
the
expression
of
mine
we
have
perhaps
grown
too
frank
with
each
other
she
said
but
you
are
a
being
from
another
world
and
that
must
excuse
us
shall
it
i
bowed
unable
to
speak
one
of
the
children
i
spoke
of
a
little
girl
of
six
is
my
own
natural
child
she
made
this
extraordinary
confession
with
her
glance
fixed
steadily
upon
mine
i
am
a
man
of
considerable
nerve
but
for
a
moment
the
world
was
dark
to
me
and
i
had
the
sensation
of
one
falling
from
a
great
height
and
then
suddenly
relief
came
to
me
in
the
thought
she
is
not
to
be
judged
by
the
standards
that
measure
morality
in
my
country
when
i
could
command
my
voice
again
i
asked
does
this
little
one
know
that
she
is
your
child
does
any
one
else
know
certainly
not
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
then
with
an
ironical
smile
i
have
treated
you
to
an
exceptional
confidence
it
is
a
matter
of
etiquette
with
us
to
keep
these
things
hidden
as
i
made
no
response
she
added
is
it
a
new
thing
to
you
for
a
parent
not
to
acknowledge
illegitimate
children
even
the
lowest
class
of
mothers
we
have
on
earth
do
not
often
abandon
their
offspring
i
replied
neither
do
they
here
she
said
the
lowest
class
have
nothing
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
and
consequently
there
is
no
necessity
that
they
should
sacrifice
their
natural
affections
in
this
respect
the
lower
classes
are
better
off
than
we
aristocrats
you
beg
the
question
i
returned
you
know
what
i
mean
i
should
not
have
thought
that
you
elodia
could
ever
be
moved
by
such
unworthy
considerations
that
you
would
ever
fear
the
opinions
you
who
profess
manly
qualities
the
noblest
of
which
is
courage
am
i
to
understand
by
that
she
said
that
men
on
your
planet
acknowledge
their
illegitimate
progeny
and
allow
them
the
privileges
of
honored
sons
and
daughters
pushed
to
this
extremity
i
could
recall
but
a
single
instance
but
one
man
whose
courage
and
generosity
in
a
case
of
the
kind
under
discussion
had
risen
to
the
level
of
his
crime
i
related
to
her
the
story
of
his
splendid
and
prolonged
life
with
its
one
blot
of
early
sin
and
its
grace
of
practical
repentance
and
upon
the
other
hand
i
told
her
of
the
one
distinguished
modern
woman
who
has
had
the
hardihood
to
face
the
world
with
her
offenses
in
her
hands
as
one
might
say
are
you
not
rather
unjust
to
the
woman
she
asked
you
speak
of
the
man
acknowledgment
of
his
sin
as
something
fine
and
you
seem
to
regard
hers
as
simply
impudent
because
of
the
vast
difference
between
the
moral
attitude
of
the
two
i
rejoined
he
confessed
his
error
and
took
his
punishment
with
humility
she
slaps
society
in
the
face
and
tries
to
make
her
genius
glorify
her
misdeeds
possibly
society
is
to
blame
for
that
by
setting
her
at
bay
if
i
have
got
the
right
idea
about
your
society
it
is
as
unrelenting
to
the
one
sex
as
it
is
indulgent
to
the
other
doubtless
it
was
ready
with
open
arms
to
receive
back
the
offending
repentant
man
but
would
it
not
have
set
its
foot
upon
the
woman
neck
if
she
had
given
it
the
chance
if
she
had
knelt
in
humility
as
he
did
a
tree
bears
fruit
after
its
kind
so
does
a
code
of
morals
gentleness
and
forgiveness
breed
repentance
and
reformation
and
harshness
begets
defiance
she
added
with
a
laugh
what
a
spectacle
your
civilization
would
present
if
all
the
women
who
have
sinned
had
the
genius
and
the
spirit
of
a
bernhardt
or
all
the
men
had
the
magnanimity
of
a
franklin
i
retorted
true
she
said
and
after
a
moment
she
continued
i
am
not
so
great
as
the
one
nor
have
i
the
of
the
other
but
it
is
not
so
much
that
i
lack
courage
it
is
rather
perhaps
a
delicate
consideration
for
and
concession
to
the
good
order
of
society
i
regarded
her
with
amazement
and
she
smiled
really
it
is
true
she
said
i
believe
in
social
order
and
i
pay
respect
to
it
by
concealing
your
own
transgressions
i
interpolated
well
why
not
suppose
i
and
my
cult
a
very
large
class
of
eminently
respectable
sinners
should
openly
trample
upon
this
convention
the
result
would
eventually
be
no
doubt
a
moral
anarchy
we
have
a
very
clear
sense
of
our
responsibility
to
the
masses
we
make
the
laws
for
their
government
and
we
allow
ourselves
to
seem
to
be
governed
by
them
also
so
that
they
may
believe
in
them
we
build
churches
and
pay
pew
rent
though
we
do
not
much
believe
in
the
religious
dogmas
and
we
leave
off
wine
when
we
entertain
temperance
people
but
why
do
you
do
these
things
i
asked
to
what
end
simply
for
the
preservation
of
good
order
and
decency
you
must
know
that
the
pleasant
vices
of
an
elegant
person
are
brutalities
in
the
uncultured
the
masses
have
no
tact
or
delicacy
they
do
not
comprehend
shades
and
refinements
of
morals
and
manners
they
can
understand
exoteric
but
not
esoteric
philosophy
we
have
really
two
codes
of
laws
i
think
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
masses
whom
you
so
highly
respect
i
said
if
you
were
to
throw
off
your
masks
and
stand
out
before
them
just
as
you
are
let
moral
anarchy
come
if
it
must
and
the
evil
be
consumed
in
its
own
flame
out
of
its
ashes
the
ph
oe
nix
always
rises
again
a
nobler
bird
how
picturesque
she
exclaimed
do
you
know
i
think
your
language
must
be
rich
in
imagery
i
should
like
to
learn
it
i
did
not
like
the
flippancy
of
this
speech
and
made
no
reply
after
a
brief
pause
she
added
there
is
truth
in
what
you
say
a
ball
must
strike
hard
before
it
can
rebound
society
must
be
fearfully
outraged
before
it
turns
upon
the
offender
if
he
be
a
person
of
consequence
but
you
can
not
expect
the
offender
to
do
his
worst
to
dash
himself
to
pieces
in
order
that
a
better
state
of
morals
may
be
built
upon
his
ruin
we
have
not
yet
risen
to
such
sublimity
of
devotion
and
i
think
the
fault
and
the
remedy
both
lie
more
with
the
good
people
the
people
who
make
a
principle
of
moral
conduct
they
allow
us
to
cajole
them
into
silence
they
wink
at
our
misdeeds
they
know
what
we
are
up
to
but
they
conceal
the
knowledge
heaven
knows
why
as
carefully
as
we
do
our
vices
contenting
themselves
with
breaking
out
in
general
denunciations
which
nobody
accepts
as
personal
rebuke
this
was
such
a
familiar
picture
that
for
a
moment
i
fancied
myself
upon
the
earth
again
and
i
thought
what
a
difficult
position
the
good
have
to
maintain
everywhere
for
having
accepted
the
championship
of
a
cause
whose
standards
are
the
highest
and
best
we
expect
them
to
be
wise
tender
strong
just
stern
merciful
charitable
unyielding
forgiving
sinless
fearless
elodia
i
said
presently
you
can
hardly
understand
what
a
shock
this
this
conversation
has
been
to
me
i
started
out
with
saying
that
i
had
often
tried
to
fancy
what
our
civilization
might
have
done
for
you
i
see
more
clearly
now
you
are
the
victim
of
the
harshest
and
cruelest
assumption
that
has
ever
been
upheld
concerning
woman
that
her
nature
is
no
finer
holier
than
man
i
have
reverenced
womanhood
all
my
life
as
the
highest
and
purest
thing
under
heaven
and
i
will
i
must
hold
fast
to
that
faith
to
that
rock
on
which
the
best
traditions
of
our
earth
are
founded
do
your
women
realize
what
they
have
got
to
live
up
to
she
asked
ironically
there
are
things
in
men
which
offset
their
virtues
i
returned
in
justice
to
my
own
sex
where
men
are
strong
women
are
gentle
where
women
are
faithful
men
are
brave
and
so
on
how
charming
to
have
the
one
nature
dovetail
into
the
other
so
neatly
she
exclaimed
i
seem
to
see
a
vision
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
a
vision
of
your
earth
in
the
beginning
you
know
that
is
the
way
in
which
all
our
traditions
start
out
there
was
a
great
heap
of
qualities
stacked
in
a
pyramid
upon
the
earth
and
the
human
creatures
were
requested
to
step
up
and
help
themselves
to
such
as
suited
their
tastes
there
was
a
great
scramble
and
your
sex
having
some
advantages
in
the
way
of
muscle
and
limb
and
not
having
yet
acquired
the
arts
of
courtesy
and
gallantry
for
which
you
are
now
so
distinguished
pressed
forward
and
took
first
choice
naturally
you
selected
the
things
which
were
agreeable
to
possess
in
themselves
and
the
exercise
of
which
would
most
redound
to
your
glory
such
virtues
as
chastity
temperance
patience
modesty
piety
and
some
minor
graces
were
thrust
aside
and
eventually
forced
upon
the
weaker
sex
since
it
was
necessary
that
all
the
qualities
should
be
used
in
order
to
make
a
complete
human
nature
is
not
that
a
pretty
fable
she
arose
and
shook
out
her
draperies
and
spread
her
parasol
there
were
crimson
spots
in
her
cheeks
i
felt
that
i
had
angered
her
and
on
the
other
hand
she
had
outraged
my
finest
feelings
but
we
were
both
capable
of
it
must
be
near
dinner
time
she
said
quietly
i
walked
along
by
her
side
in
silence
as
we
again
crossed
the
brooklet
she
stooped
and
picked
a
long
raceme
of
small
white
delicately
odorous
flowers
and
together
we
analyzed
them
and
i
recognized
them
as
belonging
to
our
family
of
this
led
to
a
discussion
of
comparative
botany
on
the
two
planets
a
safe
neutral
topic
in
outward
appearance
our
mutual
attitude
was
unchanged
inwardly
there
had
been
to
me
something
like
the
moral
upheaval
of
the
universe
for
the
first
time
i
had
melancholy
symptoms
of
nostalgia
and
passionately
regretted
that
i
had
ever
exchanged
the
earth
for
mars
severnius
had
returned
after
dinner
he
invited
me
out
onto
the
veranda
to
smoke
a
cigar
he
was
very
particular
not
to
fill
the
house
with
tobacco
smoke
elodia
he
said
did
not
like
the
odor
i
wondered
whether
he
took
such
pains
out
of
consideration
for
her
or
whether
he
simply
dreaded
her
power
to
retaliate
with
her
obnoxious
vapor
the
latter
supposition
however
i
immediately
repudiated
as
being
unjust
to
him
he
was
the
gentlest
and
sweetest
of
men
my
mind
was
so
full
of
the
subject
elodia
and
i
had
discussed
that
i
could
not
forbear
repeating
my
old
question
to
him
tell
me
my
friend
i
entreated
do
you
in
your
inmost
soul
believe
that
men
and
women
have
one
common
nature
that
women
are
no
better
at
all
than
men
and
that
men
may
if
they
will
be
as
pure
as
well
as
women
ought
to
be
severnius
smiled
if
you
can
not
find
an
answer
to
your
first
question
here
in
paleveria
i
think
you
may
in
any
of
the
savage
countries
where
i
am
quite
positive
the
women
exhibit
no
finer
qualities
than
their
lords
and
for
a
very
conclusive
reply
to
your
second
question
go
to
caskia
does
the
same
idea
of
equality
or
likeness
rather
exist
in
caskia
that
prevails
here
i
asked
o
yes
said
he
but
their
plane
of
life
is
so
much
higher
i
can
not
but
believe
in
the
equality
he
added
bad
as
things
are
with
us
we
hope
that
we
are
progressing
onward
and
upward
all
our
teaching
and
preaching
tend
toward
that
as
you
may
find
in
our
churches
and
schools
and
in
our
literature
i
am
so
much
of
an
optimist
as
to
believe
that
we
are
getting
better
and
better
all
the
time
one
evidence
is
that
there
is
less
of
shamelessness
than
there
used
to
be
with
respect
to
some
of
the
grossest
offences
against
decency
people
do
not
now
glory
in
their
vices
they
hide
them
then
you
approve
of
concealment
i
exclaimed
it
is
better
than
open
effrontery
it
shows
that
the
moral
power
in
society
is
the
stronger
that
it
is
making
the
way
of
the
transgressor
hard
driving
him
into
dark
corners
i
contrasted
this
in
my
mind
with
elodia
theory
on
the
same
subject
the
two
differed
but
there
was
a
certain
harmony
after
all
severnius
added
apropos
of
what
had
gone
before
it
does
not
seem
fair
to
me
that
one
half
of
humanity
should
hang
upon
the
skirts
of
the
other
half
it
is
better
that
we
should
go
hand
in
hand
even
though
our
progress
is
slow
but
that
can
not
be
i
returned
there
are
always
some
that
must
bear
the
burden
while
others
drag
behind
o
certainly
that
is
quite
natural
and
right
he
assented
the
strong
should
help
the
weak
what
i
mean
is
that
we
should
not
throw
the
burden
upon
any
particular
class
or
allow
to
any
particular
class
special
indulgences
that
pardon
me
is
the
fault
i
find
with
your
civilization
you
make
your
women
the
chancellors
of
virtue
and
claim
for
your
sex
the
privilege
of
being
virtuous
or
not
as
you
choose
he
smiled
as
he
added
do
you
know
your
loyalty
and
tender
devotion
to
individual
women
and
your
antagonistic
attitude
toward
women
in
general
on
the
moral
plane
presents
the
most
singular
contrast
to
my
mind
no
doubt
i
said
it
is
a
standing
joke
with
us
we
are
better
in
the
sample
than
in
the
whole
piece
as
individuals
we
are
devoted
slaves
and
lovers
and
worshipers
as
a
political
body
we
are
her
masters
from
whom
she
wins
grudging
concessions
as
a
social
factor
we
refuse
her
dictation
i
was
not
in
a
mood
to
discuss
the
matter
further
i
was
sick
at
heart
and
angry
not
so
much
with
elodia
as
with
the
conditions
that
had
made
her
what
she
was
a
woman
perfect
in
every
other
respect
but
devoid
of
the
one
supreme
thing
the
sense
of
virtue
she
was
now
to
me
simply
a
splendid
ruin
a
temple
without
holiness
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
spent
the
night
plunged
in
the
deepest
sadness
i
had
ever
known
when
one
is
suffering
an
insupportable
agony
he
catches
at
the
flimsiest
delusions
for
momentary
relief
he
says
to
himself
my
friend
is
not
dead
my
beloved
is
not
false
so
i
tried
to
cheat
myself
i
argued
why
this
is
only
a
matter
of
education
with
me
surely
how
many
women
with
finer
instincts
than
mine
have
loved
and
married
men
of
exactly
the
same
stamp
as
elodia
but
i
put
away
the
thought
with
a
shudder
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
far
more
dreadful
thing
to
relax
my
principles
and
to
renounce
my
faith
in
purity
than
to
sacrifice
my
love
the
tempter
came
in
another
form
suppose
she
should
repent
but
my
soul
revolted
no
no
jesus
might
pardon
a
magdalene
but
i
could
not
elodia
was
dead
elodia
had
never
been
that
night
i
buried
her
i
said
i
would
never
look
upon
her
face
again
but
the
morning
brought
resurrection
how
hard
a
thing
it
is
to
destroy
love
chapter
journeying
upward
the
old
order
changeth
giving
place
to
the
new

god

himself
in
many
ways
tennyson
my
conversation
with
elodia
had
the
effect
of
crystallizing
my
nebulous
plans
about
visiting
the
caskians
into
a
sudden
resolve
i
could
not
remain
longer
in
her
presence
without
pain
to
myself
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
dreaded
lest
her
astounding
lack
of
the
moral
sense
which
should
be
the
foundation
stone
of
character
would
eventually
dull
my
own
men
are
notoriously
weak
where
women
are
concerned
the
women
they
worship
as
soon
as
i
had
communicated
with
the
caskians
and
learned
that
they
were
still
anticipating
my
coming
with
they
were
so
kind
as
to
say
it
the
greatest
pleasure
i
prepared
to
set
forth
in
the
meantime
an
event
occurred
which
further
illustrated
the
social
conditions
in
paleveria
claris
the
wife
of
massilla
died
very
suddenly
and
i
was
astonished
at
the
tremendous
sensation
the
circumstance
occasioned
throughout
the
city
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
only
respect
it
was
possible
to
pay
to
the
memory
of
such
a
woman
must
be
that
which
is
expressed
in
absolute
silence
even
charity
could
not
be
expected
to
do
more
than
keep
silent
but
i
was
mistaken
claris
had
been
a
woman
of
distinction
in
many
ways
she
was
beautiful
rich
and
talented
and
she
had
wielded
an
influence
in
public
and
social
affairs
immediately
the
various
periodicals
in
thursia
and
in
neighboring
cities
flaunted
lengthy
eulogistic
obituaries
headed
with
more
or
less
well
executed
portraits
of
the
deceased
it
seemed
as
if
the
authors
of
these
effusions
must
have
run
through
dictionaries
of
complimentary
terms
which
they
culled
lavishly
and
inserted
among
the
acts
and
facts
of
her
life
with
a
kind
of
journalistic
and
private
comment
took
its
cue
from
these
authorities
it
was
said
that
she
was
a
woman
of
noble
traits
and
pretty
anecdotes
were
told
of
her
illustrating
her
generous
impulses
her
wit
her
positiveness
she
had
had
great
personal
magnetism
many
had
loved
her
many
had
also
feared
her
for
her
tongue
could
cut
like
a
sword
it
was
stated
that
her
children
had
worshiped
her
and
that
her
death
had
prostrated
her
husband
with
grief
of
the
chief
blackness
of
her
character
none
spoke
severnius
invited
me
to
attend
the
funeral
obsequies
which
took
place
in
the
auroras
temple
where
the
embalmed
body
lay
in
state
with
incense
burning
and
innumerable
candles
casting
their
pallid
light
upon
the
bier
i
observed
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
that
the
closed
doors
of
all
the
business
houses
exhibited
the
emblems
of
respect
and
sorrow
the
auroras
were
assembled
in
great
numbers
having
come
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
to
do
honor
to
the
dead
they
were
in
full
regalia
with
mourning
badges
and
carried
inverted
torches
the
religious
ceremonies
and
mystic
rites
of
the
order
were
elaborate
and
impressive
the
dirge
which
followed
and
during
which
the
members
of
the
order
formed
in
procession
and
began
a
slow
march
was
so
unutterably
and
profoundly
sad
that
i
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
a
little
sobbing
voice
directly
in
front
of
me
wailed
out
mamma
mamma
a
woman
stooped
down
and
whispered
do
you
want
to
go
up
and
kiss
mamma
before
they
take
her
away
but
the
child
shrank
back
afraid
of
the
pomp
and
ghostly
magnificence
surrounding
the
dead
form
elodia
was
of
course
the
chief
figure
in
the
procession
and
she
bore
herself
with
a
grave
and
solemn
dignity
in
keeping
with
the
ceremonies
the
sight
of
her
beautiful
face
with
its
subdued
but
lofty
expression
was
more
than
i
could
bear
i
leaned
forward
and
dropped
my
face
in
my
hands
and
let
the
requiem
rack
my
soul
with
its
sweet
torture
as
it
would
that
was
my
last
day
in
thursia
i
had
at
first
thought
of
taking
my
aeroplane
along
with
me
reflecting
that
i
might
better
begin
my
homeward
flight
from
some
mountain
top
in
caskia
but
severnius
would
not
hear
of
that
no
indeed
said
he
you
must
return
to
us
again
i
wish
to
get
ready
a
budget
for
you
to
carry
back
to
your
astronomers
which
i
think
will
be
of
value
to
them
as
i
shall
make
a
complete
map
of
the
heavens
as
they
appear
to
us
then
we
shall
be
eager
to
hear
about
your
visit
and
besides
we
want
to
see
you
again
on
the
ground
of
friendship
the
strongest
reason
of
all
you
are
too
kind
i
responded
with
much
feeling
i
knew
that
he
was
as
sincere
as
he
was
polite
this
was
at
the
last
moment
and
elodia
was
present
to
bid
me
she
seconded
her
invitation
o
yes
of
course
you
must
come
back
and
turned
the
whole
power
of
her
beautiful
face
upon
me
and
for
the
first
time
gave
me
her
hand
i
had
coveted
it
a
hundred
times
as
it
lay
lissome
and
white
in
her
lap
i
clasped
it
palm
to
palm
it
was
as
smooth
as
satin
and
not
moist
i
dislike
a
moist
hand
i
felt
that
up
to
that
moment
i
had
always
undervalued
the
sense
of
touch
it
was
the
finest
of
all
the
senses
no
music
no
work
of
art
no
wondrous
scene
had
ever
so
thrilled
me
and
set
my
nerves
as
did
the
delicate
firm
pressure
of
those
magic
fingers
the
remembrance
of
it
made
my
blood
tingle
as
i
went
on
my
long
journey
from
thursia
to
lunismar
it
was
a
long
journey
in
miles
though
not
in
time
we
traveled
like
the
wind
both
clytia
and
calypso
were
at
the
station
to
meet
me
with
their
two
children
freya
and
eurydice
i
learned
that
nearly
all
caskians
are
named
after
the
planetoids
or
other
heavenly
bodies
a
very
appropriate
thing
since
they
live
so
near
the
stars
my
heart
went
out
to
the
children
the
moment
my
eyes
fell
upon
their
faces
they
were
as
beautiful
as
raphael
cherubs
you
could
not
look
upon
them
without
thrills
of
delight
they
were
two
perfect
buds
of
the
highest
development
humanity
has
ever
attained
to
so
far
as
we
know
i
felt
that
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
know
that
in
these
lovely
forms
there
lurked
no
germs
of
evil
over
their
sweet
heads
there
hung
no
adam
curse
they
were
seated
in
a
pretty
pony
carriage
with
a
white
canopy
top
lined
with
blue
silk
freya
held
the
lines
it
appeared
that
eurydice
had
driven
down
and
he
was
to
drive
back
the
father
and
mother
were
on
foot
they
explained
that
it
was
difficult
to
drive
anything
but
the
little
carriage
up
the
steep
path
to
their
home
on
the
hillside
half
a
mile
distant
who
would
wish
for
any
other
means
of
locomotion
than
nature
has
given
him
in
a
country
where
the
buoyant
air
makes
walking
a
luxury
i
cried
stretching
my
legs
and
filling
my
lungs
with
an
unwonted
sense
of
freedom
and
power
i
had
become
accustomed
to
the
atmosphere
of
paleveria
but
here
i
had
the
same
sensations
i
had
experienced
when
i
first
landed
there
if
you
would
rather
you
may
take
my
place
sir
said
the
not
much
more
than
freya
ready
to
relinquish
the
lines
i
felt
disposed
to
laugh
but
not
so
the
wise
parents
the
little
ponies
could
not
draw
our
friend
up
the
hill
he
is
too
heavy
explained
clytia
thank
you
my
little
man
all
the
same
i
added
it
was
midsummer
in
paleveria
but
here
i
observed
everything
had
the
newness
and
delightful
freshness
of
spring
a
busy
bustling
joyous
tuneful
spring
the
grass
was
green
and
succulent
the
sap
was
in
the
trees
and
their
bark
was
sleek
and
glossy
their
leaves
just
unrolled
of
the
wild
fruit
trees
every
branch
and
twig
was
loaded
with
eager
buds
crowding
upon
each
other
as
the
heads
of
children
crowd
at
a
cottage
window
when
one
goes
by
every
thicket
was
full
of
bird
life
and
music
i
heard
the
roar
of
a
waterfall
in
the
distance
and
calypso
told
me
that
a
mighty
river
the
eudosa
gathered
from
a
hundred
mountain
streams
was
compressed
into
a
deep
gorge
or
canyon
and
fell
in
a
succession
of
cataracts
just
below
the
city
and
finally
spread
out
into
a
lovely
lake
which
was
a
wonder
in
its
way
being
many
fathoms
deep
and
as
transparent
as
the
atmosphere
we
paused
to
listen
the
children
also
how
loud
it
is
mamma
exclaimed
freya
his
mother
assented
and
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
the
falls
of
eudosa
constitute
a
large
part
of
our
life
up
here
she
said
we
note
all
its
moods
which
are
many
sometimes
it
is
drowsy
and
purrs
and
murmurs
again
it
is
merry
and
sings
or
it
is
sublime
and
rises
to
a
thunderous
roar
always
it
is
sound
do
you
know
my
ears
ached
with
the
silence
when
i
was
down
in
paleveria
i
have
said
clytia
eyes
were
black
it
was
not
an
opaque
blackness
you
could
look
through
them
down
into
her
soul
i
likened
them
in
my
mind
to
the
waters
of
the
eudosa
which
calypso
had
just
described
every
moment
something
new
attracted
our
attention
and
the
brief
journey
was
full
of
incident
the
children
were
especially
alive
to
the
small
happenings
about
us
and
i
never
before
took
such
an
interest
in
what
i
should
have
called
insignificant
things
sometimes
the
conversation
between
my
two
friends
and
myself
rose
above
the
understanding
of
the
little
ones
but
they
were
never
ignored
nor
were
they
obtrusive
they
seemed
to
know
just
where
to
fit
their
little
questions
and
remarks
into
the
talk
it
was
quite
wonderful
i
understood
of
course
that
the
children
had
been
brought
down
to
meet
me
in
order
that
i
might
make
their
acquaintance
immediately
and
establish
my
relations
with
them
since
i
was
to
be
for
some
time
a
member
of
the
household
they
had
their
small
interests
apart
from
their
elders
carefully
guarded
by
their
elders
as
children
should
have
but
whenever
they
were
permitted
to
be
with
us
they
were
of
us
they
were
never
allowed
to
feel
that
loneliness
in
a
crowd
which
is
the
most
desolate
loneliness
in
the
world
clytia
especially
had
the
art
of
enveloping
them
in
her
sympathy
though
her
intellectual
faculties
were
employed
elsewhere
and
how
they
loved
her
i
have
seen
nothing
like
it
upon
the
earth
perhaps
i
adapt
myself
with
unusual
readiness
to
new
environments
and
assimilate
more
easily
with
new
persons
than
most
people
do
i
had
as
you
know
left
paleveria
with
deep
reluctance
under
compulsion
of
my
will
moved
by
my
better
judgment
and
throughout
my
journey
i
had
deliberately
steeped
myself
in
sweet
and
bitter
memories
of
my
life
there
to
the
exclusion
of
much
that
might
have
been
interesting
and
instructive
to
me
on
the
way
a
foolish
and
childish
thing
to
have
done
and
now
suddenly
paleveria
dropped
from
me
like
a
garment
some
moral
power
in
these
new
friends
and
perhaps
in
this
city
of
lunismar
a
power
i
could
feel
but
could
not
define
raised
me
to
a
different
unmistakably
a
higher
plane
i
felt
the
change
as
one
feels
the
change
from
underground
to
the
upper
air
we
first
walked
a
little
way
through
the
city
which
quite
filled
the
valley
and
crept
up
onto
the
hillsides
here
and
there
each
building
stood
alone
with
a
little
space
of
ground
around
it
upon
which
grass
and
flowers
and
shrubbery
grew
and
often
trees
each
such
space
bore
evidence
that
it
was
as
tenderly
and
scrupulously
tended
as
a
japanese
garden
it
was
the
cleanest
city
i
ever
saw
there
was
not
an
unsightly
place
not
a
single
darksome
alley
or
lurking
place
for
vice
no
huddling
together
of
miserable
tenements
i
remarked
upon
this
and
calypso
explained
our
towns
used
to
be
compact
but
since
electricity
has
annihilated
distance
we
have
spread
ourselves
out
we
have
plenty
of
ground
for
our
population
enough
to
give
a
generous
slice
all
round
lunismar
really
extends
through
three
valleys
crystal
streams
trickled
down
from
the
mountains
and
were
utilized
for
practical
and
æsthetic
purposes
small
parks
exquisitely
pretty
were
very
numerous
and
in
them
the
sparkling
water
was
made
to
play
curious
pranks
each
of
these
spots
was
an
ideal
resting
place
and
i
saw
many
elderly
people
enjoying
them
people
whom
i
took
to
be
from
sixty
to
seventy
years
of
age
but
who
i
was
astonished
to
learn
were
all
upwards
of
a
hundred
perfect
health
and
longevity
are
among
the
rewards
of
right
living
practiced
from
generation
to
generation
the
forms
of
these
old
people
were
erect
and
their
faces
were
beautiful
in
intelligence
and
sweetness
of
expression
i
remarked
apropos
of
the
general
beauty
and
elegance
of
the
buildings
we
passed
this
must
be
the
fine
quarter
of
lunismar
no
not
especially
returned
calypso
it
is
about
the
same
all
over
is
it
possible
then
you
must
all
be
rich
said
i
we
have
no
very
poor
he
replied
though
of
course
some
have
larger
possessions
than
others
we
have
tried
several
times
in
the
history
of
our
race
to
equalize
the
wealth
of
the
country
but
the
experiment
has
always
failed
human
nature
varies
so
much
what
even
here
i
asked
what
do
you
mean
said
he
why
i
understand
that
you
caskians
have
attained
to
a
most
perfect
state
of
development
and
culture
and
i
hesitated
and
he
smiled
and
you
think
the
process
eliminates
individual
traits
he
inquired
clytia
laughingly
added
i
hope
sir
you
did
not
expect
to
find
us
all
exactly
alike
that
would
be
too
tame
you
compliment
me
most
highly
said
calypso
seriously
but
we
must
not
permit
you
to
suppose
that
we
regard
our
as
anywhere
near
perfect
in
fact
the
farther
we
advance
the
greater
and
the
grander
appears
the
excellence
to
which
we
have
not
yet
attained
though
it
would
be
false
modesty
and
a
disrespect
to
our
ancestors
not
to
admit
that
we
are
conscious
of
having
made
some
progress
as
a
race
we
know
what
our
beginnings
were
and
what
we
now
are
after
a
moment
he
went
on
i
suppose
the
principle
of
differentiation
as
we
observe
it
in
plant
and
animal
life
is
the
same
in
all
life
not
only
physical
but
intellectual
moral
spiritual
cultivation
though
it
softens
salient
traits
and
peculiarities
may
develop
infinite
variety
in
every
kind
and
species
i
understood
this
better
later
on
after
i
had
met
a
greater
number
of
people
and
after
my
perceptions
had
become
more
delicate
and
acute
or
when
a
kind
of
initiatory
experience
had
taught
me
how
to
see
and
to
value
excellence
a
few
years
ago
a
border
of
nasturtiums
exhibited
no
more
than
a
single
color
tone
the
pumpkin
yellow
and
a
bed
of
pansies
resembled
a
patch
of
purple
heather
observe
now
the
chromatic
variety
and
beauty
produced
by
intelligent
horticulture
a
group
of
commonplace
people
moderately
disciplined
by
culture
might
be
compared
to
the
pansies
and
nasturtiums
of
our
early
recollection
and
a
group
of
these
highly
refined
caskians
to
the
delicious
flowers
abloom
in
modern
gardens
we
crave
variety
in
people
as
we
crave
condiments
in
food
for
me
this
craving
was
never
so
satisfied
and
at
the
same
time
so
thoroughly
stimulated
as
in
caskian
society
which
had
a
spiciness
of
flavor
impossible
to
describe
formality
was
disarmed
by
perfect
breeding
there
was
nothing
that
you
could
call
manner
the
delicate
faculty
of
intuition
produced
harmony
i
never
knew
a
single
instance
in
which
the
social
atmosphere
was
disagreeably
jarred
a
common
enough
occurrence
where
we
depend
upon
the
machinery
of
social
order
rather
than
upon
the
vital
principle
of
good
conduct
i
inquired
of
calypso
as
we
walked
along
the
sources
of
the
wealth
he
replied
that
the
mountains
were
full
of
it
there
were
minerals
and
precious
stones
and
metals
in
great
abundance
and
all
the
ores
were
manufactured
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mines
before
being
shipped
to
the
lower
countries
and
exchanged
for
vegetable
products
this
prompted
me
to
ask
the
familiar
question
and
how
do
you
manage
the
labor
problem
he
did
not
understand
me
until
after
i
had
explained
about
our
difficulties
in
that
line
and
then
he
informed
me
that
most
of
the
people
who
worked
in
mines
and
factories
had
vested
interests
in
them
physical
labor
however
he
added
is
reduced
to
the
minimum
machinery
has
taken
the
place
of
muscle
and
thrown
an
army
of
workers
out
of
employment
and
the
means
of
living
i
suppose
i
rejoined
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
small
had
been
squeezed
out
as
well
as
the
small
operators
o
no
indeed
he
returned
in
surprise
it
has
simply
given
them
more
leisure
everybody
now
enjoys
the
luxury
of
spare
time
and
may
devote
his
energies
to
the
service
of
other
than
merely
physical
needs
he
smiled
as
he
went
on
this
labor
problem
the
creator
gave
us
was
a
knotty
one
was
it
but
what
a
tremendous
satisfaction
there
is
in
the
thought
and
in
the
fact
that
we
have
solved
it
i
was
in
the
dark
now
and
waited
for
him
to
go
on
to
labor
incessantly
to
strain
the
muscles
fret
the
mind
and
weary
the
soul
and
to
shorten
the
life
all
for
the
sake
of
supplying
the
wants
of
the
body
and
nothing
more
is
i
think
an
inconceivable
hardship
and
to
have
invoked
the
forces
of
the
insensate
elements
and
laid
our
burdens
upon
them
is
a
glorious
triumph
yes
if
all
men
are
profited
by
it
i
returned
doubtfully
they
are
of
course
said
he
at
least
with
us
i
was
shocked
to
find
it
quite
different
in
paleveria
there
it
seemed
to
me
machinery
which
has
been
such
a
boon
to
the
laborers
here
has
been
utilized
simply
and
solely
to
increase
the
wealth
of
the
rich
i
saw
a
good
many
people
who
looked
as
though
they
were
on
the
brink
of
starvation
i
do
see
how
you
manage
it
otherwise
i
confessed
it
belongs
to
the
history
of
past
generations
he
replied
perhaps
the
hardest
struggle
our
progenitors
had
was
to
conquer
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
of
which
the
greed
of
wealth
is
doubtless
the
greatest
they
began
to
realize
generations
ago
that
mars
was
rich
enough
to
maintain
all
his
children
in
comfort
and
even
luxury
that
none
need
hunger
or
thirst
or
go
naked
or
houseless
and
that
more
than
this
was
vanity
and
and
just
as
they
with
intense
assiduity
sought
out
and
cultivated
nature
resources
for
the
reduction
of
labor
and
the
increase
of
wealth
so
they
sought
out
and
cultivated
within
themselves
corresponding
resources
those
fit
to
meet
the
new
era
of
material
prosperity
namely
generosity
and
brotherly
love
then
you
really
and
truly
practice
what
you
preach
said
i
with
scant
politeness
and
i
hastened
to
add
severnius
told
me
that
you
recognize
the
trinity
in
human
nature
well
we
do
too
upon
the
earth
but
the
three
have
hardly
an
equal
chance
we
preach
the
doctrine
considerably
more
than
we
practice
it
i
understand
that
you
are
a
highly
intellectual
people
remarked
calypso
courteously
yes
i
suppose
we
are
said
i
our
achievements
in
that
line
are
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
i
added
remembering
some
felicitous
sensations
of
my
own
there
is
no
greater
delight
than
the
travail
of
intellect
which
brings
forth
great
ideas
pardon
me
he
returned
the
travail
of
soul
which
brings
forth
a
great
love
a
love
willing
to
share
equally
with
others
the
fruits
of
intellectual
triumph
is
to
my
mind
infinitely
greater
we
had
reached
the
terrace
or
little
plateau
on
which
my
house
stood
it
was
like
a
strip
of
green
velvet
for
color
and
smoothness
the
house
was
built
of
rough
gray
stone
which
showed
silver
glintings
in
the
sun
here
and
there
delicate
vines
clung
to
the
walls
there
was
a
carriage
porch
into
which
the
children
drove
and
windows
jutting
out
into
the
light
and
many
verandas
and
little
balconies
that
seemed
to
give
the
place
a
friendly
and
hospitable
air
above
there
was
a
spacious
observatory
in
which
was
mounted
a
very
fine
telescope
that
must
have
cost
a
fortune
though
my
friends
were
not
enormously
rich
as
i
had
learned
from
severnius
but
these
people
do
not
regard
the
expenditure
of
even
very
large
sums
of
money
for
the
means
of
the
best
instruction
and
the
best
pleasures
as
extravagance
if
no
one
suffers
in
consequence
i
can
not
go
into
their
economic
system
very
extensively
here
but
i
may
say
that
it
provides
primarily
that
all
shall
share
bountifully
in
the
general
good
and
after
that
individuals
may
gratify
their
respective
tastes
or
rather
satisfy
their
higher
needs
for
their
tastes
are
never
fanciful
but
always
real
as
they
can
afford
i
do
not
mean
that
this
is
a
written
law
a
formal
edict
to
be
evaded
by
such
cunning
devices
as
we
know
in
our
land
or
at
best
loosely
construed
nor
is
it
a
mere
sentiment
preached
from
pulpits
and
glorified
in
literature
a
beautiful
but
impracticable
conception
it
is
purely
a
moral
law
and
being
such
it
is
a
vital
principle
in
each
individual
consciousness
the
telescope
was
calypso
dearest
possession
but
i
never
doubted
his
willingness
to
give
it
up
if
there
should
come
a
time
when
the
keeping
of
it
would
be
the
slightest
infringement
of
this
law
i
may
add
that
in
all
the
time
i
spent
in
caskia
i
never
saw
a
man
woman
or
child
but
whose
delight
in
any
possession
would
have
been
marred
by
the
knowledge
that
his
or
her
gratification
meant
bitter
deprivation
the
question
between
thou
and
i
was
always
settled
in
favor
of
thou
and
no
barriers
of
race
nationality
birth
or
position
affected
this
universal
principle
i
made
a
discovery
in
relation
to
the
caskians
which
would
have
surprised
and
disappointed
me
under
most
circumstances
they
had
no
imagination
and
they
were
not
given
to
emotional
excitation
their
minds
touched
nothing
but
what
was
real
but
mark
this
their
real
was
our
highest
ideal
the
moral
world
was
to
them
a
real
world
the
spiritual
world
was
to
them
a
real
world
they
had
no
need
of
imagery
and
they
were
never
carried
away
by
floods
of
feeling
for
they
were
always
up
to
their
highest
level
i
mean
in
the
matter
of
kindness
and
sympathy
and
love
moreover
their
intellectual
perceptions
were
so
clear
and
the
mysteries
of
nature
were
unrolled
before
their
understanding
in
such
orderly
sequence
that
although
their
increase
of
knowledge
was
a
continuous
source
of
delight
it
never
came
in
shocks
of
surprise
or
excited
childish
wonderment
i
can
not
hope
to
give
you
more
than
a
faint
conception
of
the
dignity
and
majesty
of
a
people
whose
triple
nature
was
so
highly
and
so
harmoniously
developed
one
principle
governed
the
three
truth
they
were
true
to
every
law
under
which
they
had
been
created
and
by
which
they
were
sustained
they
were
taught
from
infancy
but
of
this
further
on
i
wish
to
reintroduce
ariadne
to
you
and
let
her
explain
some
of
the
wonders
of
their
teaching
she
being
herself
a
teacher
the
observatory
was
a
much
used
apartment
by
both
the
family
and
by
guests
it
was
a
library
also
and
it
contained
musical
instruments
a
balcony
encircled
it
on
the
outside
and
here
we
often
sat
of
evenings
especially
if
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
stars
and
moon
were
shining
the
heavens
as
seen
at
night
were
as
familiar
to
clytia
and
calypso
and
even
to
the
children
as
a
friend
face
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
out
upon
the
balcony
even
on
moonless
nights
and
when
the
stars
were
hidden
and
look
down
upon
the
city
all
brilliantly
alight
and
listen
to
the
unceasing
music
of
the
falls
of
eudosa
i
too
soon
learned
his
many
moods
back
of
the
house
there
rose
a
long
succession
of
hills
ending
finally
in
mountains
the
highest
of
which
was
called
the
spear
so
sharply
did
it
thrust
its
head
up
through
the
clouds
into
the
heavens
the
lower
hills
had
been
converted
into
vineyards
a
couple
of
men
were
fixing
the
trellises
and
calypso
excused
himself
to
his
wife
and
me
and
went
over
to
them
a
neatly
dressed
maid
came
out
of
the
house
and
greeted
the
children
who
had
much
important
news
to
relate
concerning
their
drive
and
a
last
year
to
show
her
which
they
took
pains
to
explain
was
quite
useless
to
the
birds
who
were
all
making
nice
new
nests
the
sight
of
the
maid
evidently
an
intelligent
and
girl
whose
face
beamed
affectionately
upon
the
little
ones
prompted
a
question
from
me
how
do
you
manage
about
your
servants
i
mean
house
servants
i
asked
do
you
have
people
here
who
are
willing
to
do
menial
work
clytia
looked
up
at
me
with
an
odd
expression
her
answer
coming
from
any
one
less
sincere
would
have
sounded
like
cant
we
do
not
regard
any
work
as
mean
but
some
kinds
of
work
are
distasteful
to
say
the
least
i
insisted
not
if
you
love
those
for
whom
you
labor
she
returned
a
mother
does
not
consider
any
sort
of
service
to
her
child
degrading
o
i
know
that
said
i
that
is
simply
natural
affection
but
natural
affection
you
know
is
only
the
germ
of
love
it
is
narrow
only
a
little
broader
than
selfishness
well
tell
me
how
it
applies
in
this
question
of
service
i
asked
i
am
not
able
to
comprehend
it
in
the
abstract
we
do
not
require
people
to
do
anything
for
us
which
we
would
not
do
for
ourselves
or
for
them
she
said
and
then
we
all
work
we
believe
in
work
it
means
strength
to
the
body
and
relief
to
the
mind
no
one
permits
himself
to
be
served
by
another
for
the
unworthy
reason
openly
or
tacitly
confessed
that
he
is
either
too
proud
or
too
indolent
to
serve
himself
then
why
have
servants
at
all
i
asked
my
husband
explained
to
you
she
returned
that
our
people
are
not
all
equally
rich
and
they
are
not
all
adapted
to
what
you
would
call
perhaps
the
higher
grades
of
service
you
see
the
little
maid
yonder
with
the
children
she
has
the
gifts
of
a
teacher
our
teachers
are
very
carefully
chosen
and
as
carefully
instructed
she
has
been
placed
with
me
for
our
mutual
benefit
i
could
not
intrust
my
little
ones
to
the
care
of
a
mere
paid
nurse
who
thought
only
of
her
wages
nor
could
she
work
simply
for
wages
the
money
consideration
is
the
smallest
item
in
the
arrangement
my
husband
superintends
some
steel
works
in
which
he
has
some
shares
the
man
he
is
talking
with
now
who
is
attending
to
the
grape
vines
has
also
a
large
interest
in
the
steel
works
but
he
has
no
taste
or
faculty
for
engaging
in
that
kind
of
business
he
might
spend
his
whole
life
in
idleness
if
he
chose
or
in
mental
pursuits
for
he
is
a
very
scholarly
man
but
he
loves
the
kind
of
work
he
is
doing
now
and
our
vineyard
is
his
especial
pride
moreover
a
beautiful
smile
touched
her
face
as
she
looked
up
at
the
two
men
on
the
hillside
fides
loves
my
calypso
they
are
soul
friends
when
i
became
more
familiar
with
the
household
i
found
that
the
same
relations
existed
all
round
mutual
pleasure
mutual
sympathy
mutual
helpfulness
first
there
seemed
to
be
on
the
part
of
each
employe
a
distinct
preference
and
liking
for
the
kind
of
work
he
or
she
had
undertaken
to
do
second
a
fitness
and
careful
preparation
for
the
work
and
last
the
love
of
doing
for
those
who
gave
appreciation
love
and
another
sort
of
service
or
assistance
in
return
i
heard
one
of
them
say
one
day
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
be
permitted
to
cook
the
meals
for
these
dear
people
this
was
a
woman
who
wrote
monthly
articles
on
chemistry
and
botany
for
one
of
the
leading
scientific
journals
she
was
a
woman
and
unmarried
who
did
not
wish
to
live
alone
who
abhorred
boarding
and
who
had
found
just
such
a
comfortable
nest
in
home
as
suited
all
her
needs
and
desires
of
course
she
did
not
slave
in
the
kitchen
all
day
long
and
her
position
did
not
debar
her
from
the
best
and
most
intelligent
society
nor
cut
her
off
from
the
pleasure
and
privileges
that
sweeten
life
she
brought
her
scientific
knowledge
to
the
preparation
of
the
food
she
set
before
us
and
took
as
much
pride
in
the
results
of
her
skill
as
an
inventor
takes
in
his
appliances
and
such
wholesome
delicious
dishes
i
have
never
eaten
elsewhere
clytia
believed
in
intelligently
prepared
food
as
she
believed
in
intelligent
instruction
for
her
children
she
would
have
thought
it
a
crime
to
set
an
ignorant
person
over
her
kitchen
and
this
woman
of
whom
i
am
speaking
knew
that
she
held
a
place
of
honor
and
trust
and
she
filled
it
not
only
with
dignity
but
lovingness
she
had
some
younger
women
to
assist
her
whom
she
was
instructing
in
the
science
and
the
art
of
cooking
and
who
would
take
responsible
positions
themselves
these
women
or
girls
assisted
also
in
the
housekeeping
which
was
the
most
perfect
system
in
point
of
cleanliness
order
and
beauty
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
in
a
home
because
skill
honesty
and
conscientiousness
enter
into
every
detail
of
the
life
of
these
people
the
body
is
held
in
honor
and
its
needs
are
respected
life
is
sacred
and
physical
sins
neglect
or
infringement
of
the
laws
of
health
are
classed
in
the
same
category
with
moral
transgressions
in
fact
the
same
principles
and
the
same
mathematical
rules
apply
in
the
three
natures
of
man
refined
of
course
to
correspond
with
the
ascending
scale
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
from
the
physical
to
the
spiritual
but
so
closely
are
the
three
allied
that
there
are
no
dividing
lines
there
is
no
point
where
the
mind
may
say
here
my
responsibility
ends
or
where
the
body
may
affirm
i
have
only
myself
to
please
day
by
day
these
truths
became
clear
to
me
there
was
nothing
particularly
new
in
anything
that
i
heard
indeed
it
was
all
singularly
familiar
in
sound
but
the
wonder
was
that
the
things
we
idealize
and
theorize
about
they
accept
literally
and
absorb
into
their
lives
they
have
made
living
facts
of
our
profoundest
philosophy
and
our
sublimest
poetry
are
we
then
too
philosophical
too
poetical
and
not
practical
a
good
many
centuries
have
rolled
up
their
records
and
dropped
them
into
eternity
since
we
were
given
the
simple
wonderful
lesson
whatsoever
a
man
sows
that
shall
he
also
reap
and
we
have
not
learned
it
yet
paul
voice
rings
through
the
earth
from
age
to
age
work
out
your
own
salvation
and
we
do
not
comprehend
these
people
have
never
had
a
christ
in
flesh
and
blood
but
they
have
put
into
effect
every
precept
of
our
great
teacher
they
have
received
the
message
from
whence
i
know
not
or
rather
by
what
means
i
know
not
a
new
commandment
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
love
one
another
chapter
the
master
i
spoke
as
i
saw
i
report
as
a
man
may
report
god
work
all
love
yet
all
law
browning
i
have
spoken
of
ariadne
and
promised
to
her
to
you
you
will
remember
her
as
the
graceful
girl
who
accompanied
clytia
and
her
husband
to
thursia
she
had
not
made
quite
so
strong
an
impression
upon
me
as
had
the
elder
woman
perhaps
because
i
was
so
preoccupied
with
and
interested
in
watching
the
latter
meeting
with
elodia
certainly
there
was
nothing
in
the
young
woman
herself
as
i
speedily
ascertained
to
justify
disparagement
even
with
clytia
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
was
a
member
of
our
charming
household
she
was
an
heiress
but
she
taught
in
one
of
the
city
schools
side
by
side
with
men
and
women
who
earned
their
living
by
teaching
i
rather
deprecated
this
fact
in
conversation
with
clytia
one
day
i
said
that
it
was
hardly
fair
for
a
rich
woman
to
come
in
and
usurp
a
place
which
rightfully
belonged
to
some
one
who
needed
the
work
as
a
means
of
support
alas
that
should
have
presumed
to
censure
anything
in
that
wonderful
country
with
knowledge
came
modesty
clytia
cheeks
crimsoned
with
indignation
our
teachers
are
not
beneficiaries
she
replied
nor
do
we
regard
the
positions
in
our
schools
the
teachers
positions
as
charities
to
be
dispensed
to
the
needy
the
profession
is
the
highest
and
most
honorable
in
our
land
and
only
those
who
are
fitted
by
nature
and
preparation
presume
to
aspire
to
the
office
there
is
no
bar
against
those
who
are
so
fitted
the
richest
and
the
most
distinguished
stand
no
better
and
no
poorer
chance
than
the
poorest
and
most
insignificant
we
must
have
the
best
material
wherever
it
can
be
found
we
had
but
just
entered
the
house
clytia
and
i
when
ariadne
glided
down
the
stairs
into
the
room
where
we
sat
and
approached
me
with
the
charming
frankness
and
unaffectedness
of
manner
which
so
agreeably
characterizes
the
manners
of
all
these
people
she
was
rather
tall
and
slight
though
her
form
did
not
suggest
frailty
she
resembled
some
elegant
flower
whose
nature
it
is
to
be
delicate
and
slender
she
seemed
even
to
sway
a
little
and
undulate
like
a
lily
on
its
stem
i
regarded
her
with
attention
not
unmixed
with
curiosity
as
a
man
is
prone
to
regard
a
young
lady
into
whose
acquaintance
he
has
not
yet
made
inroads
my
chief
impression
about
her
was
that
she
had
remarkable
eyes
they
were
of
an
indistinguishable
dark
color
large
horizontally
but
not
too
wide
open
eyes
that
drew
yours
continually
without
your
being
able
to
tell
whether
it
was
to
settle
the
question
of
color
or
to
find
out
the
secret
of
their
fascination
or
whether
it
was
simply
that
they
appealed
to
your
artistic
sense
as
being
something
finer
than
you
had
ever
seen
before
they
were
heavily
fringed
at
top
and
bottom
and
so
were
in
shadow
except
when
she
raised
them
toward
the
light
her
complexion
was
pale
her
hair
light
and
fluffy
her
brows
and
lashes
were
several
shades
darker
than
the
hair
her
hands
were
lovely
her
dress
was
of
course
white
or
cream
of
some
soft
clinging
material
and
she
wore
a
bunch
of
blue
flowers
in
her
belt
slightly
wilted
there
is
this
difference
in
women
some
produce
an
effect
simply
and
others
make
a
impression
upon
the
mind
ariadne
was
of
the
latter
sort
whatever
she
appropriated
though
but
a
tiny
blossom
seemed
immediately
to
proclaim
its
ownership
and
to
swear
its
allegiance
to
her
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
her
there
the
blue
flowers
in
her
belt
gave
her
in
my
mind
the
supreme
title
to
all
of
their
kind
i
could
never
bear
to
see
another
woman
wear
the
same
variety
and
i
liked
them
best
when
they
were
a
little
wilted
her
belongings
suggested
herself
so
vividly
that
if
one
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
fan
a
book
a
garment
of
hers
he
was
affected
as
by
a
presence
i
soon
understood
why
it
was
that
my
eyes
sought
her
face
so
persistently
drawn
by
a
power
infinitely
greater
than
the
mere
power
of
beauty
it
was
due
to
the
law
of
moral
gravitation
that
by
which
men
are
attracted
to
a
leader
through
intuitive
perception
of
a
quality
in
him
round
which
their
own
energies
may
nucleate
we
all
recognize
the
need
of
a
centre
of
a
save
perhaps
the
few
eccentrics
detached
particles
who
have
lost
their
place
in
the
general
order
makers
of
chaos
and
disturbers
of
peace
it
is
this
power
which
constitutes
one
of
the
chief
qualifications
of
a
teacher
in
lunismar
because
it
rests
upon
a
fact
universally
believed
in
spiritual
royalty
an
august
force
which
can
not
be
ignored
and
is
never
ridiculed
as
galileo
was
ridiculed
and
punished
for
his
wisdom
because
there
ignorance
and
prejudice
do
not
exist
and
the
superstition
which
planted
the
martyr
stake
has
never
been
known
ariadne
said
that
she
had
been
up
in
the
observatory
and
that
there
were
indications
of
an
approaching
storm
i
hope
it
may
be
a
fine
one
exclaimed
clytia
i
thought
this
rather
an
extraordinary
remark
coming
from
one
of
the
sex
whose
formula
is
more
likely
to
be
i
hope
it
will
not
be
a
severe
one
at
that
moment
a
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
majesty
of
whose
presence
i
certainly
felt
before
my
eyes
fell
upon
him
or
it
might
have
been
the
reflection
i
saw
in
the
countenances
of
my
two
companions
i
stood
with
my
back
to
the
door
facing
them
which
gave
me
the
curious
sensation
i
turned
round
and
clytia
immediately
started
forward
ariadne
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
with
an
accent
of
peculiar
sweetness
a
commingling
of
delight
and
reverence
and
caressing
tenderness
ah
the
master
clytia
took
him
by
the
hand
and
brought
him
to
me
where
i
stood
rooted
to
my
place
father
this
is
our
friend
she
said
simply
without
further
ceremony
of
introduction
it
was
enough
he
had
come
on
purpose
to
see
me
and
therefore
he
knew
who
i
was
as
for
him
one
does
not
explain
a
king
the
title
by
which
ariadne
had
called
him
did
not
at
the
moment
raise
an
inquiry
in
my
mind
i
accepted
it
as
the
natural
definition
of
the
man
he
was
a
man
of
kingly
proportions
with
eyes
from
which
clytia
had
borrowed
their
limpid
blackness
his
glance
had
a
wide
compresiveness
and
a
swift
sure
loving
insight
he
struck
me
as
a
man
used
to
moving
among
multitudes
with
his
head
above
all
but
his
heart
embracing
all
you
may
think
it
strange
but
i
was
not
abashed
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
and
there
was
in
this
divine
countenance
i
may
well
call
it
divine
the
lambent
light
of
a
love
so
kindly
and
so
tender
that
fear
pride
vanity
egotism
even
false
modesty
our
pet
hypocrisy
surrendered
without
a
protest
i
think
i
talked
more
than
any
one
else
being
delicately
prompted
to
furnish
some
account
of
the
world
to
which
i
belong
and
stimulated
by
the
profound
interest
with
which
the
master
attended
to
every
word
that
i
said
but
i
received
an
equal
amount
of
information
myself
usually
in
response
to
the
questions
with
which
i
rounded
up
my
periods
like
this
we
do
so
and
so
upon
the
earth
how
is
it
here
the
replies
threw
an
extraordinary
light
upon
the
social
order
and
conditions
there
i
naturally
dwelt
upon
the
salient
characteristics
of
our
people
i
mean
of
course
the
american
people
i
spoke
of
our
enormous
grasp
of
the
commercial
principle
of
our
manipulation
of
political
and
even
social
forces
to
great
financial
ends
of
our
easy
acquisition
of
fortunes
of
our
tremendous
push
and
energy
directed
to
the
accumulation
of
wealth
and
of
our
enthusiasms
and
institutions
our
religions
and
their
antagonisms
and
of
the
many
other
things
in
which
we
take
pride
and
i
learned
that
in
caskia
there
is
no
such
thing
as
speculative
enterprise
all
business
has
an
actual
basis
most
discouraging
to
the
adventurous
spirit
in
search
of
sudden
riches
there
is
no
monetary
skill
worthy
the
dignified
appellation
of
financial
management
and
no
use
for
that
particular
development
of
the
talent
of
ingenuity
all
the
systems
involving
the
use
of
money
conduct
their
affairs
upon
the
simplest
arithmetical
rules
in
their
simplest
form
addition
subtraction
multiplication
division
there
are
banks
of
course
for
the
mutual
convenience
of
all
but
there
are
no
magnificent
delusions
called
stocks
no
boards
of
trade
no
bulls
and
bears
no
corners
no
mobilizing
of
capital
for
any
questionable
purposes
no
gambling
houses
no
pitfalls
for
unwary
feet
and
no
mad
fever
of
greed
and
scheming
coursing
through
the
veins
of
men
and
driving
them
to
insanity
and
more
than
all
there
are
no
fictitious
values
put
upon
fads
and
fancies
of
the
hour
nor
even
upon
works
of
art
the
caskians
are
not
easily
deceived
an
impostor
is
impossible
because
the
people
are
instructed
in
the
quality
of
things
intellectual
and
moral
and
spiritual
as
well
as
in
things
physical
they
are
as
sure
of
the
knowableness
of
art
as
they
are
and
as
we
are
of
the
knowableness
of
science
art
is
but
refined
science
and
the
principles
are
the
same
in
both
but
more
delicately
and
also
more
comprehensively
interpreted
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
one
thing
more
there
are
no
impostors
the
law
operates
no
visible
machinery
against
such
crimes
should
there
be
any
the
master
explained
it
to
me
in
this
way
the
law
is
established
in
each
individual
conscience
and
rests
securely
upon
great
heavens
i
cried
as
the
wonder
of
it
broke
upon
my
understanding
and
how
many
millions
of
years
has
it
taken
your
race
to
attain
to
this
perfection
it
is
not
perfection
he
replied
it
only
approximates
perfection
we
are
yet
in
the
beginning
well
by
the
grace
of
god
you
are
on
the
right
way
said
i
i
am
familiar
enough
with
the
doctrines
you
live
by
to
know
that
it
is
the
right
way
they
are
the
same
that
we
have
been
taught
theoretically
for
centuries
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
believed
they
could
be
carried
out
literally
as
you
appear
to
carry
them
out
we
are
tolerably
honest
as
the
word
goes
but
when
honesty
shades
off
into
these
theories
why
we
leave
it
to
the
preachers
and
women
then
you
really
have
some
among
you
who
believe
in
the
higher
truths
the
master
said
and
his
brows
went
up
a
little
in
token
of
my
picture
of
must
have
seemed
a
terrible
one
to
him
o
yes
indeed
said
i
taking
my
cue
from
this
and
i
proceeded
to
give
some
character
sketches
of
the
grand
men
and
women
of
earth
whose
lives
have
been
one
long
heroic
struggle
for
truth
and
to
whom
a
terrible
death
has
often
been
the
crowning
triumph
of
their
faith
i
related
to
him
briefly
the
history
of
america
from
its
discovery
four
hundred
years
ago
and
told
him
about
the
splendid
material
prosperity
the
enormous
wealth
the
extraordinary
inventions
the
great
population
the
unprecedented
system
and
the
progress
in
general
education
and
culture
of
a
country
which
had
its
birth
but
yesterday
in
a
deadly
struggle
for
freedom
of
conscience
and
of
our
later
crueller
war
for
freedom
that
was
not
for
ourselves
but
for
a
despised
race
i
described
the
prodigious
waves
of
public
and
private
generosity
that
have
swept
millions
of
money
into
burned
cities
for
their
rebuilding
and
tons
of
food
into
lands
for
the
starving
i
told
him
of
the
coming
together
in
fellowship
of
purpose
of
the
great
masses
to
face
a
common
danger
or
to
meet
a
common
necessity
and
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
giants
who
in
outward
appearance
and
in
the
seeming
of
their
daily
lives
are
not
unlike
their
fellows
but
to
whom
all
eyes
turn
for
help
and
strength
in
the
hour
of
peril
but
i
did
not
at
that
time
undertake
any
explanation
of
our
religious
creeds
for
it
somehow
seemed
to
me
that
these
would
not
count
for
much
with
a
people
who
expressed
their
theology
solely
by
putting
into
practice
the
things
they
believed
i
had
the
thought
in
mind
though
and
determined
to
exploit
it
later
on
as
i
have
said
before
the
master
listened
with
rapt
attention
and
when
i
had
finished
he
exclaimed
i
am
filled
with
amazement
a
country
yet
so
young
so
far
advanced
toward
truth
he
gave
himself
up
to
contemplation
of
the
picture
i
had
drawn
and
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
i
seemed
to
see
an
inspired
prophecy
of
my
country
future
grandeur
presently
he
rose
and
went
to
a
window
and
with
uplifted
face
murmured
in
accents
of
the
sublimest
reverence
that
have
ever
touched
my
understanding
o
god
and
a
wonderful
thing
happened
the
invocation
was
responded
to
by
a
voice
that
came
to
each
of
our
souls
as
in
a
flame
of
fire
here
am
i
the
velocity
of
worlds
is
not
so
swift
as
was
our
transition
from
the
human
to
the
divine
but
it
was
not
an
unusual
thing
this
supreme
triumph
of
the
spirit
it
is
what
these
people
call
divine
worship
a
service
which
is
never
perfunctory
which
is
not
ruled
by
time
or
place
one
may
worship
alone
or
two
or
three
or
a
multitude
it
matters
not
to
god
who
only
asks
to
be
worshiped
in
spirit
and
in
truth
be
the
time
sabbath
or
the
place
temple
or
field
or
closet
a
little
later
i
remarked
to
the
master
wishing
to
have
a
point
cleared
up
you
say
there
are
no
fictitious
values
put
upon
works
of
art
how
do
you
mean
he
replied
inasmuch
as
truth
is
always
greater
than
human
achievement
which
at
best
may
only
approximate
the
truth
the
value
of
a
work
of
art
should
be
determined
by
its
merit
alone
and
not
by
the
artist
reputation
or
any
other
remote
influence
of
course
i
do
not
include
particular
objects
consecrated
by
association
or
by
time
but
suppose
a
man
paints
a
great
picture
for
which
he
recieves
a
great
price
and
thereafter
uses
the
fame
he
has
won
as
speculating
capital
to
enrich
himself
i
beg
the
pardon
of
every
artist
for
setting
up
the
hideous
hypothesis
but
to
complete
it
the
moment
a
man
does
that
he
loses
his
which
is
about
as
bad
as
anything
that
can
happen
to
him
it
is
moral
suicide
and
he
has
done
a
grievous
wrong
to
art
by
lowering
the
high
standard
he
himself
helped
to
raise
but
his
crime
is
no
greater
than
that
of
the
who
ignorantly
or
insolently
set
up
false
standards
and
scorn
the
real
test
of
values
however
these
important
matters
are
not
left
entirely
to
individual
consciences
artists
and
are
not
the
only
judges
of
art
we
have
no
mysterious
sanctuaries
for
a
privileged
few
all
may
enter
all
are
indeed
made
to
enter
not
by
violence
but
by
the
simple
natural
means
employed
in
all
teaching
all
will
not
hold
the
brush
or
the
pen
or
the
chisel
but
from
their
earliest
infancy
our
children
are
carefully
taught
to
recognize
the
forms
of
truth
in
all
art
the
eye
was
made
to
see
the
ear
to
hear
the
mind
to
understand
the
visit
was
at
an
end
when
he
left
us
it
was
as
though
the
sun
had
passed
under
a
cloud
clytia
went
out
with
him
her
arm
lovingly
linked
in
his
and
i
turned
to
ariadne
tell
me
i
said
why
is
he
called
master
is
it
a
formal
title
or
was
it
bestowed
in
recognition
of
the
quality
of
the
man
both
she
answered
no
man
receives
the
title
who
has
not
the
but
it
is
in
one
way
perfunctory
it
is
the
distinguishing
title
of
a
teacher
of
the
highest
rank
and
what
are
teachers
of
the
highest
rank
presidents
of
colleges
i
asked
o
no
she
replied
with
a
smile
they
are
not
necessarily
teachers
of
schools
old
and
young
alike
are
their
pupils
they
are
those
who
have
advanced
the
farthest
in
all
the
paths
of
knowledge
especially
the
moral
and
the
spiritual
i
understand
said
i
they
are
your
priests
ministers
pastors
your
doctors
of
divinity
perhaps
she
returned
doubtfully
our
terminology
was
not
always
clear
to
those
people
usually
she
went
on
they
begin
with
teaching
in
the
schools
as
a
kind
of
apprenticeship
but
naturally
they
rise
there
is
that
same
quality
in
them
which
forces
great
poets
and
painters
to
high
positions
in
their
respective
fields
then
they
rank
with
geniuses
i
exclaimed
and
the
mystery
of
the
man
in
whose
grand
company
i
had
spent
the
past
hour
was
solved
ariadne
looked
at
me
as
though
surprised
that
i
should
have
been
ignorant
of
so
natural
and
patent
a
fact
excuse
me
said
i
but
it
is
not
always
the
case
with
us
any
man
may
set
up
for
a
religious
teacher
who
chooses
with
or
without
preparation
just
as
any
one
may
set
up
for
a
poet
or
a
painter
or
a
composer
of
oratorio
genius
must
be
universal
on
your
planet
then
she
returned
innocently
i
suppose
i
might
have
let
it
pass
there
was
nobody
to
contradict
any
impressions
i
might
be
pleased
to
convey
but
there
is
something
in
the
atmosphere
of
lunismar
which
compels
the
truth
good
or
bad
no
said
i
they
do
it
by
grace
of
their
unexampled
a
quality
much
encouraged
among
us
and
because
we
do
not
legislate
upon
such
matters
the
boast
of
our
country
is
liberty
and
in
some
respects
we
fail
to
comprehend
the
glorious
possession
too
often
we
mistake
lawlessness
for
liberty
the
fine
arts
are
our
playthings
and
each
one
follows
his
own
fancy
like
children
with
toys
she
repeated
as
one
repeats
a
strange
phrase
the
meaning
of
which
is
obscure
by
the
way
i
said
you
must
be
rather
arbitrary
here
is
a
man
liable
to
arrest
or
condign
punishment
if
he
happens
to
burlesque
any
of
the
higher
callings
under
the
impression
that
he
is
a
genius
she
laughed
and
i
added
i
assure
you
that
this
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
with
us
it
would
be
impossible
here
she
replied
because
no
one
could
so
mistake
himself
though
it
seems
egotistical
for
one
of
us
to
say
so
but
a
curious
expression
touched
her
face
a
questioning
doubting
puzzled
look
we
are
speaking
honestly
are
we
not
i
wondered
if
i
had
betrayed
my
american
characteristic
of
hyperbole
and
i
smiled
as
i
answered
her
my
countrymen
are
at
my
mercy
i
know
but
had
i
a
thousand
grudges
against
them
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
am
not
so
base
as
to
take
advantage
of
my
unique
opportunity
to
do
them
harm
we
are
a
young
people
as
i
said
awhile
ago
a
very
young
people
and
in
many
respects
we
have
the
innocent
audacity
of
babes
yes
i
added
i
have
told
you
the
truth
but
not
all
of
it
earth
too
is
pinnacled
with
great
names
of
masters
like
yours
and
poets
and
painters
and
scientists
and
inventors
even
in
the
darkest
ages
there
have
been
these
points
of
illumination
what
i
chiefly
wonder
at
here
is
the
universality
of
intelligence
of
understanding
you
are
a
teacher
of
children
pray
tell
me
how
you
teach
how
do
you
get
such
wonderful
results
i
can
comprehend
a
little
you
people
are
i
wish
to
know
the
the
all
our
teaching
she
said
embraces
the
nature
the
physical
comes
first
of
course
for
you
can
not
reach
the
higher
faculties
through
barriers
of
physical
pain
and
sickness
hunger
and
cold
the
child
must
have
a
good
body
and
to
this
end
he
is
taught
the
laws
that
govern
his
body
through
careful
and
attentive
observance
of
cause
and
effect
and
almost
immediately
he
begins
to
have
fascinating
glimpses
of
similar
laws
operating
upon
a
higher
than
the
physical
plane
children
have
boundless
curiosity
you
know
and
this
makes
the
teacher
work
easy
and
delightful
for
we
all
love
to
tell
a
piece
of
news
through
this
faculty
the
desire
to
know
you
can
lead
a
child
in
whatever
paths
you
choose
you
can
almost
make
him
what
you
choose
a
little
experience
teaches
a
child
that
every
act
brings
consequences
good
or
bad
but
he
need
not
get
all
his
knowledge
by
experience
that
is
too
costly
the
reasoning
faculty
must
be
aroused
and
then
the
conscience
which
is
to
the
soul
what
the
sensatory
nerves
are
to
the
body
but
the
conscience
is
a
latent
faculty
and
here
comes
in
the
teacher
most
delicate
and
important
work
conscience
is
quite
dependent
upon
the
intellect
we
must
know
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
otherwise
conscience
must
stagger
blindly
yes
i
know
i
interrupted
the
consciences
of
some
very
good
people
in
our
world
have
burned
witches
at
the
stake
horrible
she
said
with
a
shudder
she
continued
this
then
is
the
basis
we
try
through
that
simple
law
of
cause
and
effect
which
no
power
can
set
aside
to
supply
each
child
with
a
safe
sure
motive
for
conduct
that
will
serve
him
through
life
as
well
in
his
secret
thought
as
in
outward
act
no
one
with
this
principle
in
him
will
ever
seek
to
throw
the
blame
of
his
misdeeds
upon
another
we
teach
the
relative
value
of
repentance
that
though
it
can
not
avert
or
annul
the
effects
of
it
may
serve
to
prevent
repetition
of
the
wrong
do
you
punish
offenders
i
asked
she
smiled
punishment
for
error
is
like
treating
symptoms
instead
of
the
disease
which
produced
them
is
it
not
relief
for
the
present
but
no
help
for
the
future
punishment
and
even
criticism
are
dangerous
weapons
to
be
used
if
at
all
with
a
tact
and
skill
that
make
one
tremble
to
think
of
they
are
too
apt
to
destroy
freedom
of
intercourse
between
teacher
and
pupil
unjust
criticism
especially
shuts
the
teacher
from
an
opportunity
to
widen
the
pupil
knowledge
too
often
our
criticisms
are
barriers
which
we
throw
about
ourselves
shutting
out
affection
and
confidence
and
then
we
wonder
why
friends
and
family
are
sealed
books
to
us
that
is
a
fact
i
assented
heartily
and
no
one
can
keep
to
his
highest
level
if
he
is
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
coldness
and
censure
even
christ
our
great
teacher
affirmed
that
he
could
not
do
his
work
in
certain
localities
because
of
prevailing
unbelief
there
is
one
thing
which
it
is
difficult
to
learn
went
on
ariadne
discrimination
the
fitness
of
things
i
may
not
do
that
which
is
proper
for
another
to
do
why
because
in
each
individual
consciousness
is
a
special
and
peculiar
law
of
destiny
upon
which
rests
the
burden
of
personal
responsibility
it
is
this
law
of
the
individual
that
makes
it
an
effrontery
for
any
one
to
constitute
himself
the
chancellor
of
another
conscience
or
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
any
act
which
does
not
fall
under
the
condemnation
of
the
common
law
it
is
given
to
each
of
us
to
create
a
world
within
ourselves
and
round
about
us
each
unlike
all
the
others
though
conforming
to
the
universal
principles
of
right
as
poets
however
original
conform
to
the
universal
principles
of
language
we
have
choice
let
me
give
you
a
paradox
every
one
may
have
first
choice
of
inexhaustible
material
in
infinite
variety
but
how
to
choose
i
quoted
milton
lines
he
that
has
light
within
his
own
clear
breast
may
sit
in
the
center
and
enjoy
bright
day
but
he
that
hides
a
dark
soul
and
foul
thoughts
benighted
walks
under
the
sun
himself
is
his
own
dungeon
she
thanked
me
with
a
fine
smile
clytia
had
come
in
a
few
moments
before
but
her
entrance
had
been
such
that
it
had
caused
no
disturbing
vibrations
in
the
current
of
sympathetic
understanding
upon
which
ariadne
and
myself
were
launched
now
however
we
came
ashore
as
it
were
and
she
greeted
us
as
returned
voyagers
love
to
be
greeted
with
cordial
welcome
she
informed
us
that
dinner
was
ready
and
i
was
alarmed
lest
we
might
have
delayed
that
important
function
the
children
had
disappeared
for
the
day
having
already
had
their
dinner
in
the
nursery
under
the
supervision
of
their
mother
calypso
had
invited
in
his
friend
fides
he
was
a
man
of
powerful
frame
and
strong
fine
physionomy
with
a
mind
as
virile
as
the
former
and
as
as
the
latter
the
woman
who
had
created
the
dinner
i
do
not
know
of
a
better
word
also
sat
at
table
with
us
and
contributed
many
a
gem
to
the
thought
of
the
hour
thought
may
seem
an
odd
word
to
use
in
connection
with
a
dinner
conversation
unless
it
is
a
toast
dinner
but
even
in
their
gayest
and
lightest
moods
these
people
are
never
thoughtless
their
minds
instead
of
being
lumbering
machinery
requiring
much
force
and
preparation
to
put
in
motion
are
set
upon
the
daintiest
and
most
delicate
wheels
their
mental
equipment
corresponds
with
the
astonishing
mechanical
contrivances
for
overcoming
friction
in
the
physical
world
and
this
exquisite
machinery
is
applied
in
exactly
the
same
ways
sometimes
for
utility
and
sometimes
for
simple
enjoyment
ariadne
prediction
had
been
correct
the
was
mustering
his
forces
round
the
and
the
eudosa
was
answering
the
challenge
from
the
valley
after
dinner
we
went
up
into
the
observatory
and
from
thence
passed
out
onto
the
balcony
thrilled
by
the
same
sense
of
delightful
expectancy
you
see
in
the
unennuied
eyes
of
youth
waiting
for
the
curtain
to
go
up
at
a
play
all
save
myself
had
of
course
seen
in
lunismar
but
none
were
there
was
eagerness
in
every
face
we
took
our
station
at
a
point
which
gave
us
the
best
view
of
the
mountains
and
saw
the
lightning
cut
their
sides
with
flaming
swords
and
thrust
gleaming
spears
down
into
the
darkling
valley
as
if
in
furious
spite
at
the
blackness
which
had
gathered
everywhere
for
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
a
wall
as
dense
as
night
and
left
the
world
to
its
fate
before
the
rain
began
to
fall
there
was
an
appalling
stillness
which
even
the
angry
mutterings
of
the
eudosa
could
not
overcome
and
then
as
though
the
heavens
had
marshaled
all
their
strength
for
one
tremendous
assault
the
thunder
broke
forth
i
have
little
physical
timidity
but
the
shock
struck
me
into
a
pose
as
rigid
as
death
the
others
were
only
profoundly
impressed
spiritually
alive
to
the
majesty
of
the
performance
that
first
explosion
was
but
the
prelude
to
the
mighty
piece
played
before
us
around
us
at
our
feet
and
overhead
earth
has
been
spared
the
awfulness
without
destruction
and
has
missed
the
glory
of
such
a
storm
as
this
but
the
grandest
part
was
yet
to
come
the
rain
lasted
perhaps
twenty
minutes
and
then
a
slight
rent
was
made
in
the
thick
and
sombre
curtain
that
covered
the
face
of
the
heavens
and
a
single
long
shaft
of
light
touched
the
frozen
point
of
the
spear
and
turned
its
crystal
and
its
snow
to
gold
the
rest
of
the
mountain
was
still
swathed
in
cloud
a
moment
more
and
a
superb
rainbow
and
another
and
yet
another
were
flung
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
spear
below
the
glittering
finger
the
rent
in
the
curtain
grew
wider
and
beyond
all
the
splendors
of
colors
were
blazoned
upon
the
shimmering
draperies
that
closed
about
and
slowly
vanished
with
the
sun
we
sat
in
silence
for
a
little
time
i
happened
to
be
near
fides
and
i
presently
turned
to
him
and
said
that
was
a
most
extraordinary
manifestation
of
the
almighty
power
he
looked
at
me
but
did
not
reply
ariadne
who
had
heard
my
remark
exclaimed
laughingly
fides
thinks
the
opening
of
a
flower
is
a
far
more
wonderful
manifestation
than
the
stirring
up
of
the
elements
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
i
had
discovered
the
master
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
balcony
and
beside
him
a
tall
slender
woman
with
thick
white
hair
whom
i
rightly
took
to
be
his
wife
i
was
presented
to
her
shortly
and
the
mental
comment
i
made
at
the
moment
i
never
afterward
reversed
she
is
worthy
to
be
the
master
wife
although
the
rain
had
ceased
the
sky
was
a
blank
as
night
settled
upon
the
world
not
a
star
shone
but
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
we
sat
and
talked
for
a
couple
of
hours
suddenly
a
band
of
music
on
the
terrace
below
silenced
our
voices
it
was
most
peculiar
music
now
it
was
thrown
upon
the
dark
background
of
shadows
and
now
it
was
a
dance
of
sprites
and
now
a
whispered
confidence
in
the
ear
it
made
no
attempt
to
arouse
the
emotions
to
produce
either
sadness
or
exaltation
it
was
a
mere
frolic
of
music
when
it
was
over
i
went
down
stairs
with
the
others
humming
an
inaudible
tune
as
though
i
had
been
to
the
opera
chapter
a
comparison
he
who
rests
on
what
he
is
has
a
destiny
above
destiny
and
can
make
mouths
at
fortune
emerson
work
out
your
own
salvation
paul
i
had
a
feeling
when
i
retired
to
my
room
that
night
as
if
years
lay
between
me
and
the
portion
of
my
life
which
i
had
spent
in
paleveria
but
across
the
wide
gulf
my
soul
embraced
severnius
all
that
was
beautiful
and
lovable
and
noble
in
that
country
centered
in
him
as
light
centres
in
a
star
but
of
elodia
i
could
not
think
without
pain
i
even
felt
a
kind
of
helpless
rage
mingling
with
the
pain
remembering
that
it
was
simply
the
brutality
of
the
social
system
under
which
she
had
been
reared
that
had
stamped
so
hideous
a
brand
upon
a
character
so
fair
i
contrasted
her
in
my
mind
with
the
women
asleep
in
the
rooms
about
me
whose
thoughts
were
as
pure
as
the
thoughts
of
a
child
had
she
been
born
here
i
reflected
she
would
have
been
like
clytia
like
ariadne
and
oh
the
pity
of
it
that
she
had
not
i
was
restless
wakeful
miserable
thinking
of
her
remembering
her
wit
her
intelligence
her
power
remembering
how
charming
she
was
how
magnetic
and
alas
how
faulty
she
gave
delight
to
all
about
her
and
touched
all
life
with
color
but
she
was
like
a
magnificent
bouquet
culled
from
the
gardens
of
wisdom
and
beauty
a
thing
of
but
temporary
value
whose
fragrance
must
soon
be
scattered
whose
glory
must
soon
pass
away
ariadne
was
the
white
and
slender
lily
slowly
unfolding
petal
after
petal
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
its
own
inner
growth
should
the
blossom
be
torn
asunder
its
perfume
would
rise
as
incense
about
its
destroyer
and
from
the
life
hidden
at
its
root
would
come
forth
more
perfect
blossoms
and
more
delicate
fragrance
i
had
arrived
at
this
estimate
of
her
character
by
a
process
more
unerring
and
far
swifter
than
reason
you
might
call
it
spiritual
telegraphy
the
thought
of
her
not
only
restored
but
immeasurably
increased
my
faith
in
woman
and
i
fell
asleep
at
last
soothed
and
comforted
i
awoke
in
the
morning
to
the
sound
of
singing
it
was
voice
and
she
was
touching
the
strings
of
a
harp
all
caskians
sing
and
all
are
taught
to
play
upon
at
least
one
musical
instrument
every
household
is
an
orchestra
ariadne
voice
was
exceptionally
fine
where
all
voices
were
excellent
its
quality
was
singularly
sometimes
it
was
the
joyous
note
of
the
lark
and
again
it
was
the
tenderly
sweet
and
passionately
sad
of
the
when
i
looked
out
of
my
window
the
sun
was
just
silvering
the
point
of
the
spear
and
light
wreaths
of
mist
were
lifting
from
the
valleys
i
saw
the
master
staff
in
hand
going
up
toward
the
mountains
and
fides
was
coming
across
the
hills
i
had
wondered
when
i
saw
the
master
and
his
wife
on
the
balcony
the
night
before
how
they
came
to
be
there
at
such
an
hour
on
such
a
night
i
took
the
first
opportunity
to
find
out
the
only
way
to
find
out
about
people
affairs
in
caskia
is
by
asking
questions
or
by
observation
which
takes
longer
they
speak
with
their
lives
instead
of
their
tongues
concerning
so
many
things
that
other
people
are
wordy
about
they
are
quite
devoid
of
theories
but
they
are
charmingly
willing
to
impart
what
one
wishes
to
know
i
learned
that
clytia
parents
lived
within
a
stone
throw
of
her
house
on
one
side
and
calypso
grandparents
at
about
the
same
distance
on
the
other
and
i
also
learned
that
it
was
an
arrangement
universally
practiced
the
clustering
together
of
families
in
order
that
the
young
might
always
be
near
at
hand
to
support
and
protect
and
to
smooth
the
pathway
of
the
old
certain
savage
races
upon
the
earth
abandon
the
aged
to
starvation
and
death
certain
other
races
not
savage
abandon
them
to
a
loneliness
that
is
only
less
cruel
but
these
extraordinarily
just
people
repay
to
the
helplessness
of
age
the
tenderness
and
care
the
loving
sympathy
which
they
themselves
received
in
the
helplessness
of
infancy
the
grandparents
happened
to
be
away
from
home
and
i
did
not
meet
them
for
some
days
on
that
first
morning
we
had
clytia
parents
to
breakfast
immediately
after
breakfast
the
circle
broke
up
it
was
morning
to
visit
and
assist
in
the
school
which
her
little
ones
attended
ariadne
started
off
to
her
work
with
a
fresh
cluster
of
the
delicious
blue
flowers
in
her
belt
and
i
had
the
choice
of
visiting
the
with
calypso
or
taking
a
trip
to
lake
eudosa
on
foot
with
the
master
i
could
hardly
conceal
the
delight
with
which
i
decided
in
favor
of
the
latter
we
set
off
at
once
and
what
a
walk
it
was
a
little
way
through
the
city
and
then
across
a
strip
of
lush
green
meadow
starred
with
daisies
thence
into
woods
and
then
down
down
down
along
the
rocky
edge
of
the
canyon
past
the
deafening
waterfalls
to
the
wonderful
lake
we
passed
on
our
way
through
the
city
a
large
fine
structure
which
upon
inquiry
i
found
to
be
the
place
where
the
master
taught
on
the
sabbath
day
do
you
wish
to
look
in
he
asked
and
we
turned
back
and
entered
the
interior
was
beautiful
and
vast
capacious
enough
to
seat
several
thousand
people
and
every
sunday
it
was
filled
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
for
finding
out
something
about
the
religion
of
this
people
and
i
began
by
asking
are
there
any
divisions
in
your
church
different
denominations
i
mean
he
seemed
unable
to
comprehend
me
and
i
was
obliged
to
enter
into
an
explanation
which
i
made
as
simple
as
possible
of
course
relative
to
the
curse
of
adam
and
the
plan
of
redemption
in
order
that
he
might
understand
the
importance
attaching
to
our
creeds
i
told
him
of
the
fierce
sanguinary
struggles
of
past
ages
and
the
grave
controversies
of
modern
times
pertaining
to
certain
dogmas
and
tenets
as
to
whether
they
were
essential
or
to
salvation
salvation
from
what
he
asked
why
from
sin
but
how
we
know
only
one
way
to
be
saved
from
sin
and
what
is
that
i
inquired
not
to
sin
but
that
is
impossible
i
rejoined
feeling
that
he
was
trifling
with
the
subject
though
that
was
unlike
him
yes
it
is
impossible
he
replied
gravely
god
did
not
make
us
perfect
he
left
us
something
to
do
for
ourselves
that
is
heretical
said
i
do
you
believe
in
the
fall
of
man
no
i
think
i
believe
in
the
rise
of
man
he
answered
smiling
o
i
keep
forgetting
i
exclaimed
that
i
am
on
another
planet
and
that
this
planet
has
different
relations
with
god
from
what
your
planet
has
returned
he
i
can
not
think
so
sir
it
is
altogether
a
new
idea
to
me
and
pardon
me
an
illogical
one
we
belong
to
the
same
system
and
why
should
not
the
people
of
mars
have
the
sentence
for
sin
revoked
as
well
as
the
people
of
earth
why
should
not
we
have
been
provided
with
an
intercessor
but
tell
me
is
it
really
so
do
you
upon
the
earth
not
suffer
the
consequences
of
your
acts
why
certainly
we
do
said
i
while
we
live
the
plan
of
salvation
has
reference
to
the
life
after
death
he
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
ground
you
believe
in
that
life
do
you
not
i
asked
believe
in
it
he
looked
up
amazed
all
life
is
eternal
as
long
as
god
lives
we
shall
live
a
little
later
he
said
you
spoke
of
the
fall
of
man
what
did
you
mean
that
man
was
created
a
perfect
being
but
through
sin
became
imperfect
so
that
god
could
not
take
him
back
to
himself
save
by
redemption
and
god
sent
his
only
son
to
the
earth
you
say
to
redeem
your
race
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
acts
so
we
believe
said
i
after
another
brief
silence
he
remarked
man
did
not
begin
his
life
upon
this
planet
in
perfection
at
this
moment
we
passed
a
beautiful
garden
in
which
there
was
an
infinite
profusion
of
flowers
in
infinite
variety
look
at
those
roses
he
exclaimed
god
planted
the
species
a
crude
and
simple
plant
and
turned
it
over
to
man
to
do
what
he
might
with
it
and
in
the
same
way
he
placed
man
himself
here
to
perfect
himself
if
he
would
i
am
not
jealous
of
god
nor
envious
of
you
but
just
why
he
should
have
arranged
to
spare
you
all
this
labor
and
commanded
us
to
work
out
our
own
salvation
i
can
not
comprehend
it
struck
me
as
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
he
should
have
used
the
very
words
of
one
of
our
own
greatest
logicians
a
longer
silence
followed
the
master
walked
with
his
head
inclined
in
the
attitude
of
profound
thought
at
last
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
looked
up
relaxing
his
brows
it
may
be
prodigiously
presumptuous
he
said
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
has
been
a
mistake
somewhere
how
a
mistake
i
asked
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
question
but
said
tell
me
the
story
tell
me
the
exact
words
if
you
can
of
this
great
teacher
whom
you
believe
to
be
the
son
of
god
i
gave
a
brief
outline
of
the
saviour
life
and
death
and
it
was
a
gratification
to
me
because
it
seemed
in
some
sort
an
acknowledgment
or
concession
to
my
interpretation
to
see
that
he
was
profoundly
affected
oh
he
cried
his
hands
were
clenched
and
his
body
writhed
as
with
the
actual
sufferings
of
the
man
of
sorrows
that
a
race
of
men
should
have
been
brought
through
such
awful
tribulation
to
see
god
why
could
they
not
accept
the
truth
from
his
lips
because
they
would
not
they
kept
crying
us
a
sign
and
he
gave
himself
to
death
i
grouped
together
as
many
of
the
words
of
christ
as
i
could
recall
and
i
was
surprised
not
only
that
his
memory
kept
its
grasp
on
them
all
but
that
he
was
able
to
see
at
once
their
innermost
meaning
it
was
as
if
he
dissolved
them
in
the
wonderful
alembic
of
his
understanding
and
instantly
restored
them
in
crystals
of
pure
truth
divested
alike
of
mysticism
and
remote
significance
he
took
them
up
one
by
one
and
held
them
to
the
light
as
one
holds
precious
gems
he
knew
them
recognized
them
and
appraised
them
with
the
delight
and
comprehensiveness
and
the
critical
judgment
of
a
connoisseur
of
jewels
you
believe
that
christ
came
into
your
world
he
said
that
you
have
life
that
is
he
came
to
teach
you
that
the
life
of
the
soul
and
not
the
body
is
the
real
life
he
died
you
might
live
but
it
was
not
the
mere
fact
of
his
death
that
assured
your
life
he
was
willing
to
give
up
his
life
in
pledge
of
the
truth
of
what
he
taught
that
you
might
believe
that
truth
and
act
upon
that
belief
and
so
gain
life
he
taught
only
the
truth
his
soul
was
a
fountain
of
truth
hence
when
he
said
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
it
was
as
though
he
said
teach
your
children
the
truths
i
have
taught
you
and
when
he
cried
in
the
tenderness
of
his
great
and
yearning
love
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
he
meant
oh
you
can
not
doubt
it
my
friend
he
meant
come
give
up
your
strifes
and
hatreds
your
greeds
and
vanities
and
selfishness
and
the
endless
weariness
of
your
pomps
and
shows
come
to
me
and
learn
how
to
live
and
where
to
find
peace
and
contentment
new
commandment
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
love
one
another
this
was
the
yoke
and
the
burden
which
your
christ
offered
to
you
in
place
of
the
tyranny
of
sin
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
there
is
nothing
finer
than
that
there
is
no
law
above
that
we
caskians
have
been
trying
to
work
upon
that
principle
for
thousands
of
years
it
is
all
that
there
is
of
religion
save
the
spiritual
perception
of
abstract
truths
which
we
may
conceive
of
more
or
less
clearly
as
attributes
of
god
your
great
teacher
explained
to
you
that
god
is
a
spirit
and
should
be
worshiped
in
spirit
and
in
truth
hence
we
may
worship
him
where
and
when
we
will
worship
is
not
a
ceremony
but
profound
contemplation
of
the
infinite
wisdom
the
infinite
power
and
the
infinite
love
of
god
the
outdoor
world
here
where
we
stand
now
with
the
marvelous
sky
above
us
the
clouds
the
sun
this
mighty
cataract
before
us
and
all
the
teeming
life
the
beauty
the
fragrance
the
song
is
the
best
place
of
all
i
pity
the
man
who
lacks
the
faculty
of
worship
it
means
that
though
he
may
have
eyes
he
sees
not
and
ears
he
hears
not
do
you
believe
in
temples
of
worship
i
asked
yes
he
replied
i
believe
in
them
for
though
walls
and
stained
windows
shut
out
the
physical
glories
of
the
world
they
do
not
blind
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
and
if
there
is
one
in
the
pulpit
who
has
absorbed
enough
of
the
attributes
of
god
into
his
soul
to
stand
as
an
interpreter
to
the
people
it
is
better
than
waiting
outside
then
too
there
is
grandeur
in
the
coming
together
of
a
multitude
to
worship
in
oneness
of
spirit
and
all
things
are
better
when
shared
with
others
i
believe
that
art
should
bring
its
best
treasures
to
adorn
the
temples
of
worship
and
that
music
should
voice
this
supreme
adoration
but
in
this
matter
we
should
be
careful
not
to
limit
god
in
point
of
locality
what
does
the
saying
mean
asked
for
bread
and
ye
gave
me
a
stone
i
think
it
might
mean
for
one
thing
asked
where
to
find
god
and
you
pointed
to
a
building
the
finite
mind
is
prone
to
worship
its
own
creations
of
god
there
are
ignorant
races
upon
this
planet
perhaps
also
upon
yours
who
dimly
recognize
deity
in
this
way
they
bring
the
best
they
have
of
skill
in
handiwork
to
the
making
of
a
pitiful
image
to
represent
god
and
then
forgetting
the
motive
they
bow
down
to
the
image
we
call
that
idolatry
but
it
is
hard
even
for
the
enlightened
to
avoid
this
sin
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
i
can
not
comprehend
the
importance
you
seem
to
place
upon
the
forms
and
symbols
nor
in
what
way
they
relate
to
religion
but
they
may
have
some
temporary
value
i
can
hardly
judge
of
that
baptism
you
say
is
a
token
and
a
symbol
but
do
a
people
so
far
advanced
in
intelligence
and
perception
still
require
tokens
and
symbols
and
can
you
not
even
yet
separate
the
spiritual
meaning
of
christ
words
from
their
literal
meaning
you
worship
the
man
the
god
if
you
will
instead
of
that
for
which
he
stood
he
himself
was
a
symbol
he
stood
for
the
things
he
wished
to
teach
am
the
truth
am
the
life
do
you
not
see
that
he
meant
am
the
exponent
of
truth
i
teach
you
how
to
live
hearken
unto
me
in
those
days
in
which
he
lived
perhaps
language
was
still
and
the
people
whom
he
taught
could
not
grasp
the
abstract
hence
he
used
the
more
forcible
style
the
concrete
he
could
not
have
made
this
clearer
than
in
those
remarkable
words
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
i
know
i
replied
as
he
paused
for
some
response
from
me
my
intellect
accepts
your
interpretation
of
these
things
but
this
symbolic
religion
of
ours
is
ingrained
in
our
very
consciences
so
that
neglect
of
the
outward
forms
of
christianity
seems
almost
worse
than
actual
sin
and
it
will
continue
to
be
so
he
said
until
you
learn
to
practice
the
truth
for
truth
sake
until
you
love
your
neighbor
not
only
because
christ
commanded
it
but
because
the
principle
of
love
is
in
your
consciences
as
for
belonging
to
a
church
i
can
only
conceive
of
that
in
the
social
sense
for
every
soul
that
aspires
upward
belongs
to
christ
church
universal
they
are
the
lambs
of
his
flock
the
objects
of
his
tenderest
care
but
i
can
see
how
a
great
number
of
religious
societies
or
organizations
are
possible
as
corresponding
with
the
requirements
of
different
groups
of
people
yes
i
said
glad
of
this
admission
and
these
societies
are
all
aiming
at
the
same
thing
that
you
teach
the
brotherhood
of
man
they
clothe
the
poor
they
look
after
the
sick
they
send
missionaries
to
the
heathen
they
preach
morality
and
temperance
all
in
his
name
because
to
tell
the
truth
they
can
not
conceive
of
any
virtue
disassociated
from
the
man
jesus
jesus
is
the
great
leader
of
the
spiritual
forces
marshaled
under
the
banners
of
truth
upon
the
earth
in
all
their
good
works
which
are
so
great
and
so
many
good
christians
give
christ
the
glory
because
but
for
him
they
would
not
have
had
the
truth
the
life
the
world
was
so
dark
so
ignorant
all
the
ancient
civilizations
upon
the
earth
and
some
of
them
were
magnificent
have
perished
because
they
did
not
possess
this
truth
and
this
spiritual
life
which
christ
taught
there
was
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
but
not
love
there
was
a
great
deal
of
philosophy
but
it
was
cold
there
was
mysticism
but
it
did
not
satisfy
do
you
wonder
sir
that
a
world
should
love
the
man
who
brought
love
into
that
world
who
brought
peace
to
men
no
no
said
the
master
i
do
not
wonder
it
is
grand
sublime
and
he
gave
his
body
to
be
destroyed
by
his
persecutors
in
order
to
prove
to
the
world
that
there
is
a
life
higher
than
the
physical
and
indestructible
and
that
physical
death
has
no
other
agony
than
physical
pain
ah
i
see
i
understand
and
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
call
this
man
your
redeemer
i
think
my
friend
he
added
that
you
have
now
a
civilization
upon
the
earth
which
will
not
perish
after
a
moment
he
remarked
turning
to
me
with
a
smile
we
are
not
so
far
apart
as
we
thought
we
were
when
we
first
started
out
are
we
no
said
i
the
only
wonder
to
me
is
that
you
should
have
been
in
possession
from
the
beginning
of
the
same
truths
that
were
revealed
to
us
only
a
few
centuries
ago
through
as
we
have
been
taught
to
believe
special
divine
favor
say
rather
infinite
divine
love
he
returned
then
we
shall
indeed
stand
upon
the
same
plane
all
alike
children
of
god
as
we
continued
our
walk
his
mind
continued
to
dwell
upon
the
teachings
of
christ
and
he
sought
to
make
clear
to
me
one
thing
after
another
pray
without
ceasing
he
repeated
reflectively
well
now
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
that
literally
the
literal
meaning
of
prayer
is
verbal
petition
the
real
meaning
is
the
sincere
desire
of
the
soul
you
are
commanded
to
pray
in
secret
and
god
will
reward
you
openly
put
the
two
together
and
you
have
this
desire
constantly
within
your
secret
soul
to
learn
and
to
practice
the
truth
and
your
open
reward
shall
be
the
countless
blessings
which
are
attracted
to
the
perfect
life
the
inner
life
whatsoever
you
will
in
my
name
and
it
shall
be
granted
you
that
is
in
the
name
of
truth
and
love
shall
you
pray
for
a
personal
blessing
or
favor
which
might
mean
disaster
or
injury
to
another
prayer
is
the
desire
and
effort
of
the
soul
to
keep
in
harmony
with
god
great
laws
of
the
universe
as
it
had
been
in
thursia
so
it
was
here
people
came
to
see
me
from
all
parts
and
there
were
some
remarkable
companies
in
parlors
usually
they
were
spontaneous
gatherings
evening
parties
being
often
made
up
with
little
or
no
premeditation
there
was
music
always
in
great
variety
and
of
the
most
delightful
and
elevated
character
singing
and
many
kinds
of
bands
and
sometimes
there
was
dancing
not
of
the
kind
which
awakened
in
de
quincey
soul
the
very
grandest
form
of
passionate
sadness
but
of
a
kind
that
made
me
wish
i
had
been
the
inventor
of
the
phrase
poetry
of
motion
so
that
i
could
have
used
it
here
fresh
and
unhackneyed
in
all
there
was
no
more
voluptuousness
than
in
the
frolic
of
children
conversation
might
and
often
was
as
light
as
the
dance
of
butterflies
but
it
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
rise
upon
a
hint
or
a
suggestion
to
the
most
sublimated
regions
of
thought
for
these
people
do
not
leave
their
minds
at
home
when
they
go
into
society
and
here
in
society
i
saw
the
workings
of
the
principle
of
brotherly
love
in
a
strikingly
beautiful
aspect
there
was
no
disposition
on
the
part
of
any
one
to
outdo
another
rather
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
conspiracy
to
make
each
one
rise
to
his
best
the
spirit
of
criticism
was
absent
and
the
spirit
of
petty
jealousy
the
women
without
exception
were
dressed
with
exquisite
taste
because
this
is
a
part
of
their
culture
and
every
woman
was
beautiful
for
loving
eyes
approved
her
and
every
man
was
noble
for
no
one
doubted
him
if
the
sky
was
clear
a
portion
of
each
evening
was
spent
in
the
observatory
or
out
upon
the
balcony
as
the
company
chose
and
the
great
telescope
was
always
in
requisition
and
always
pointed
to
the
earth
if
the
earth
was
in
sight
the
last
evening
i
spent
in
lunismar
was
such
an
one
as
i
have
described
ariadne
and
i
happened
to
be
standing
together
and
alone
in
a
place
upon
the
balcony
which
commanded
a
view
of
our
world
it
was
particularly
clear
and
brilliant
that
night
and
you
may
imagine
with
what
feelings
i
contemplated
it
being
about
to
return
to
it
we
had
been
silent
for
some
little
time
when
she
turned
her
eyes
to
me
those
wonderful
eyes
and
said
a
little
sadly
i
thought
i
shall
never
look
upon
earth
again
without
happy
memories
of
your
brief
visit
among
us
a
strange
impulse
seized
me
and
i
caught
her
hands
and
held
them
fast
in
mine
and
i
o
ariadne
when
i
return
to
earth
again
and
lift
my
eyes
toward
heaven
it
will
not
be
mars
that
i
shall
see
but
only
ariadne
a
strange
light
suddenly
flashed
over
her
face
and
into
her
eyes
as
she
raised
them
to
mine
and
in
their
clear
depths
was
revealed
to
me
the
supreme
law
of
the
universe
the
law
of
life
the
law
of
love
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
sad
but
not
hopeless
she
murmured
and
i
also
shall
