joan
patricia
to
the
world
at
large
of
course
it
was
just
another
day
a
different
sort
entirely
at
different
places
on
the
great
round
rolling
earth
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
it
was
tuesday
on
one
side
of
the
date
line
and
monday
on
the
other
it
was
wedding
anniversary
and
birthday
and
another
would
get
out
of
jail
today
it
was
warm
it
was
cool
it
was
fair
it
was
cloudy
one
looked
forward
to
the
future
with
confidence
with
hope
with
uneasiness
or
with
terror
according
to
one
temperament
and
one
geographical
location
and
past
history
to
most
of
the
human
race
this
was
nothing
whatever
but
just
another
day
but
to
joe
kenmore
it
was
a
most
particular
day
indeed
here
it
was
the
gray
hour
just
before
sunrise
and
already
there
were
hints
of
reddish
colorings
in
the
sky
it
was
chilly
and
somehow
the
world
seemed
still
and
breathless
to
joe
the
feeling
of
tensity
marked
this
morning
off
from
all
the
other
mornings
of
his
experience
he
got
up
and
began
to
dress
in
major
holt
quarters
back
of
that
giant
steel
called
the
shed
near
the
town
of
bootstrap
he
felt
queer
because
he
felt
so
much
as
usual
by
all
the
rules
he
should
have
experienced
a
splendid
noble
resolution
and
a
fiery
exaltation
and
perhaps
even
an
admirable
sensation
of
humility
and
unworthiness
to
accomplish
what
was
expected
of
him
today
and
deep
enough
inside
he
felt
suitable
emotion
but
it
happened
that
he
could
take
time
to
feel
things
adequately
today
he
was
much
more
aware
that
he
wanted
some
coffee
rather
badly
and
that
he
hoped
everything
would
go
all
right
he
looked
out
of
the
windows
at
empty
dreary
desert
under
the
dawn
sky
today
was
the
day
he
be
leaving
on
a
rather
important
journey
he
hoped
that
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
were
nervous
he
also
hoped
that
nobody
had
gotten
at
the
fuel
for
the
pushpots
and
that
the
crew
that
had
calculated
everything
had
made
any
mistakes
he
was
also
bothered
about
the
fuel
and
he
was
uncomfortable
about
the
business
of
releasing
the
spaceship
from
the
launching
cage
there
was
too
cause
for
worry
in
the
rockets
if
the
tube
linings
had
shrunk
there
would
be
some
rather
gruesome
consequences
and
there
could
always
be
orders
from
washington
to
delay
or
even
cancel
everything
in
short
his
mind
was
full
of
strictly
practical
details
he
have
time
to
feel
noble
aspirations
or
sensations
of
high
destiny
he
had
a
very
tricky
and
exacting
job
ahead
of
him
the
sky
was
growing
lighter
outside
stars
faded
in
a
paling
blue
and
the
desert
showed
faint
colorings
he
tied
his
necktie
a
keening
set
up
off
to
the
southward
over
the
sere
and
dreary
landscape
it
was
a
faraway
noise
something
like
the
lament
of
a
calf
bleating
for
its
mother
joe
took
a
deep
breath
he
looked
but
saw
nothing
the
noise
though
told
him
that
there
been
no
cancellation
of
orders
so
far
he
mentally
uncrossed
one
pair
of
fingers
he
possibly
cross
fingers
against
all
foreseeable
disasters
there
enough
fingers
or
toes
either
but
it
was
good
that
so
far
the
schedule
held
he
went
downstairs
major
holt
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
living
room
of
his
quarters
electric
lights
burned
but
already
the
windows
were
brightening
joe
straightened
up
and
tried
to
look
casual
strictly
speaking
major
holt
was
a
family
friend
who
happened
also
to
be
security
officer
here
in
charge
of
protecting
what
went
on
in
the
giant
construction
shed
he
had
a
sufficiently
difficult
time
of
it
in
the
past
and
the
difficulties
might
keep
on
in
the
future
he
was
also
the
ranking
officer
here
and
consequently
the
immediate
boss
of
enterprise
today
affair
was
still
highly
precarious
the
whole
thing
was
controversial
and
uncertain
and
might
spoil
the
career
of
somebody
with
stars
on
his
collar
if
it
should
fail
so
nobody
in
the
high
brass
wanted
the
responsibility
if
everything
went
well
somebody
suitable
would
take
the
credit
and
the
bows
meanwhile
major
holt
was
boss
by
default
he
looked
sharply
at
joe
morning
good
morning
sir
said
joe
major
holt
daughter
sally
had
a
sort
of
understanding
with
joe
but
the
major
had
the
knack
of
cordiality
and
nobody
felt
too
much
at
ease
with
him
besides
joe
was
wearing
a
uniform
for
the
first
time
this
morning
there
were
only
eight
such
uniforms
in
the
world
so
far
it
was
black
whipcord
with
an
eisenhower
jacket
narrow
silver
braid
on
the
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
silver
rocket
for
a
badge
where
a
plane
pilot
wears
his
wings
it
was
strictly
practical
against
accidental
catchings
in
machinery
the
trousers
were
narrow
and
tucked
into
soft
leather
boots
and
the
wide
leather
belt
had
flat
loops
for
the
attachment
of
special
equipment
its
width
was
a
brace
against
the
strains
of
acceleration
sally
had
had
much
to
do
with
its
design
but
it
had
yet
been
decided
by
the
pentagon
whether
the
space
exploration
project
would
be
taken
over
by
the
army
or
the
navy
or
the
air
corps
so
joe
wore
no
insignia
of
rank
technically
he
was
still
a
civilian
the
noise
to
the
south
had
become
a
howl
sweeping
closer
and
trailed
by
other
howlings
the
pushpots
are
on
the
way
over
as
you
can
hear
said
the
major
detachedly
in
the
curious
light
of
daybreak
and
electric
bulbs
together
your
crew
is
up
and
about
so
far
there
seems
to
be
no
hitch
you
feeling
all
right
for
the
attempt
today
if
you
want
the
truth
sir
i
feel
better
with
about
ten
practical
experience
behind
me
but
my
gang
and
myself
we
had
all
the
training
we
can
get
without
an
actual
we
the
crew
to
try
it
i
think
we
manage
i
see
said
the
major
you
do
your
best
we
may
have
to
do
better
than
that
admitted
joe
wrily
true
enough
you
may
the
major
paused
you
well
aware
that
there
are
ah
people
who
do
not
altogether
like
the
idea
of
the
united
states
possessing
an
artificial
satellite
of
earth
i
ought
to
know
it
admitted
joe
the
earth
second
moon
out
in
space
for
just
six
weeks
now
did
seem
nowadays
like
the
bitterly
contested
achievement
it
actually
was
from
earth
it
was
merely
a
tiny
speck
of
light
in
the
sky
identifiable
for
what
it
was
only
because
it
moved
so
swiftly
and
serenely
from
the
sunset
toward
the
east
or
from
night
darkness
into
the
but
it
had
been
fought
bitterly
before
it
was
launched
it
was
first
proposed
to
the
united
nations
but
even
discussion
in
the
council
was
vetoed
so
the
united
states
had
built
it
alone
yet
the
nations
which
objected
to
it
as
an
international
project
liked
it
even
less
as
a
national
one
and
they
done
what
they
could
to
wreck
it
the
building
of
the
great
steel
hull
now
out
there
in
emptiness
had
been
fought
more
bitterly
by
more
ruthless
and
more
highly
trained
saboteurs
than
any
other
enterprise
in
history
there
been
two
attempts
to
blast
it
with
atomic
bombs
but
it
was
high
aloft
rolling
grandly
around
the
earth
so
close
to
its
primary
that
its
period
was
little
more
than
four
hours
and
it
rose
in
the
west
and
set
in
the
east
six
times
a
day
today
joe
would
try
to
get
a
supply
ship
up
to
it
a
very
small
cargo
ship
named
pelican
one
the
crew
of
the
platform
needed
food
and
air
and
water
and
especially
the
means
of
today
would
be
the
first
attempt
at
a
to
space
the
enemies
of
the
platform
have
given
up
said
the
major
formidably
and
they
used
spectroscopes
on
the
platform
rocket
fumes
apparently
they
been
able
to
duplicate
our
fuel
joe
nodded
major
holt
went
on
for
more
than
a
month
military
intelligence
has
been
aware
that
rockets
were
under
construction
behind
the
iron
curtain
they
will
be
guided
missiles
and
they
will
carry
atom
bomb
heads
one
or
more
may
be
finished
any
day
when
they
finished
you
can
bet
that
they
be
used
against
the
platform
and
you
will
carry
up
the
first
arms
for
the
platform
your
ship
carries
half
a
dozen
interceptor
rockets
to
handle
any
attack
from
earth
it
vitally
important
for
them
to
be
delivered
they
attack
the
platform
demanded
joe
angrily
that
war
not
if
they
deny
guilt
said
the
major
ironically
and
if
we
have
nothing
to
gain
by
war
the
platform
is
intended
to
defend
the
peace
of
the
world
if
it
is
destroyed
we
wo
defend
the
peace
of
the
world
by
going
to
war
over
it
but
while
the
platform
can
defend
itself
it
is
not
likely
that
anyone
will
dare
to
make
war
so
you
have
a
very
worthwhile
mission
i
suggest
that
you
have
breakfast
and
report
to
the
shed
i
on
my
way
there
now
joe
said
yes
sir
the
major
started
for
the
door
then
he
stopped
he
hesitated
and
said
abruptly
if
my
security
measures
have
failed
joe
you
be
killed
if
there
has
been
sabotage
or
carelessness
it
will
be
my
fault
i
sure
sir
that
everything
anybody
could
do
everything
anybody
can
do
to
destroy
you
has
been
done
said
the
major
grimly
not
only
sabotage
joe
but
blunders
and
mistakes
and
stupidities
that
always
happens
but
i
done
my
best
i
suspect
asking
your
forgiveness
if
my
best
has
been
good
enough
then
before
joe
could
reply
the
major
went
hurriedly
away
joe
frowned
for
a
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
must
be
pretty
tough
to
be
responsible
for
the
things
that
other
men
lives
depend
on
when
you
ca
share
their
danger
but
just
then
the
smell
of
coffee
reached
his
nostrils
he
trailed
the
scent
there
was
a
coffeepot
steaming
on
the
table
in
the
there
was
a
note
on
a
plate
luck
i
see
you
in
the
shed
joe
was
relieved
sally
holt
had
been
somewhere
around
underfoot
all
his
life
she
was
a
swell
girl
but
he
was
grateful
that
he
did
have
to
talk
to
her
just
now
he
poured
coffee
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
went
to
the
window
the
faraway
howling
was
much
nearer
and
dawn
had
definitely
arrived
small
cloudlets
in
a
pale
blue
sky
were
tinted
pinkish
by
the
rising
sun
patches
of
yucca
and
mesquite
and
sage
out
beyond
the
officers
quarters
area
stretched
away
to
a
horizon
they
were
now
visibly
different
in
color
from
the
earth
between
them
and
cast
long
streaky
shadows
the
cause
of
the
howling
was
still
invisible
but
joe
cared
nothing
for
that
he
stared
skyward
searching
and
he
saw
what
he
looked
for
there
was
a
small
bright
sliver
of
sunlight
high
aloft
it
moved
slowly
toward
the
east
it
showed
the
unmistakable
glint
of
sunshine
upon
polished
steel
it
was
the
artificial
satellite
a
huge
steel
hull
which
had
been
built
in
the
gigantic
shed
from
whose
shadow
joe
looked
upward
it
was
the
size
of
an
ocean
liner
and
six
weeks
since
some
hundreds
of
pushpots
all
straining
at
once
had
gotten
it
out
of
the
shed
and
panted
toward
the
sky
with
it
they
gotten
it
twelve
miles
high
and
speeding
eastward
at
the
ultimate
speed
they
could
manage
they
fired
jato
rockets
all
at
once
and
so
pushed
its
speed
up
to
the
preposterous
then
they
dropped
away
and
the
giant
steel
thing
had
fired
its
own
rockets
which
made
flames
and
swept
on
out
to
emptiness
before
its
rockets
were
consumed
it
was
in
an
orbit
miles
above
the
earth
surface
and
it
hurtled
through
space
at
something
over
miles
an
hour
it
circled
the
earth
in
exactly
four
hours
fourteen
minutes
and
seconds
and
it
would
continue
its
circling
forever
needing
no
fuel
and
never
descending
it
was
a
second
moon
for
the
planet
earth
but
it
could
be
destroyed
joe
watched
hungrily
as
it
went
on
to
meet
the
sun
smoothly
unhurriedly
serenely
the
remote
and
twinkling
speck
floated
on
out
of
sight
and
then
joe
went
back
to
the
table
and
ate
his
breakfast
quickly
he
wolfed
it
he
had
an
appointment
to
meet
that
minute
speck
some
miles
out
in
space
his
appointment
was
for
a
very
few
hours
hence
he
been
training
for
just
this
morning
effort
since
before
the
platform
launching
there
was
a
great
box
swinging
in
gimbal
rings
over
in
the
shed
there
were
motors
and
projectors
and
over
two
thousand
vacuum
tubes
relays
and
electronic
units
it
was
a
space
flight
simulator
a
descendant
of
the
link
trainer
which
once
taught
plane
pilots
how
to
fly
but
this
offered
the
problems
and
the
sensations
of
rocketship
control
and
for
many
hours
every
day
joe
and
the
three
members
of
his
crew
had
labored
in
it
the
simulator
duplicated
every
sight
and
sound
and
feeling
all
but
heavy
acceleration
to
be
experienced
in
the
of
a
rocketship
to
space
the
similitude
of
flight
was
utterly
convincing
sometimes
it
was
appallingly
so
when
emergencies
and
catastrophes
and
calamities
were
staged
in
horrifying
detail
for
them
to
learn
to
respond
to
in
six
weeks
they
learned
how
to
handle
a
spaceship
so
far
as
anybody
could
learn
on
solid
ground
if
the
simulator
was
correctly
built
nobody
could
be
sure
about
that
but
it
was
the
best
training
that
could
be
devised
in
minutes
joe
had
finished
the
coffee
and
was
out
of
major
quarters
and
headed
for
the
shed
nearest
entrance
the
shed
was
a
gigantic
metal
structure
rising
out
of
sheer
flat
desert
there
were
hills
to
the
westward
but
only
arid
plain
to
the
east
and
south
and
north
there
was
but
one
town
in
hundreds
of
miles
and
that
was
bootstrap
built
to
house
the
workmen
who
built
the
platform
and
the
still
invisible
ferociously
howling
pushpots
and
now
the
small
supply
ships
the
first
of
which
was
to
make
its
first
trip
today
the
shed
seemed
very
near
because
of
its
monstrous
size
when
he
was
actually
at
the
base
of
its
wall
it
seemed
to
fill
half
the
firmament
and
more
than
half
the
horizon
he
went
in
and
felt
when
the
guard
eyes
fell
on
his
uniform
there
was
a
tiny
vestibule
then
he
was
in
the
shed
itself
and
it
was
enormous
there
were
acres
of
flooring
there
was
a
vast
arching
roof
which
was
fifty
stories
high
in
the
center
all
this
size
had
been
needed
when
the
space
platform
was
being
built
men
on
the
far
side
were
merely
specks
and
the
rows
of
windows
to
admit
light
usually
did
no
more
than
make
a
gray
twilight
inside
but
there
was
light
enough
today
to
the
east
the
shed
wall
was
split
from
top
to
bottom
a
colossal
triangular
gore
had
been
loosened
and
thrust
out
and
rolled
aside
and
a
doorway
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
let
in
the
sunshine
through
it
joe
could
see
the
fiery
red
ball
which
was
the
sun
just
leaving
the
horizon
but
there
was
something
more
urgent
for
him
to
look
at
pelican
one
had
been
moved
into
its
launching
cage
only
joe
perhaps
would
really
have
recognized
it
actually
it
was
a
streamlined
hull
of
steel
eighty
feet
long
by
twenty
in
diameter
there
were
stubby
metal
fins
useless
in
space
and
even
on
but
essential
for
the
planned
method
of
landing
on
its
return
there
were
thick
quartz
ports
in
the
but
its
form
was
completely
concealed
now
by
the
attached
exterior
rockets
it
had
been
shifted
into
the
huge
cradle
of
steel
beams
from
which
it
was
to
be
launched
men
swarmed
about
it
and
over
it
in
and
out
of
the
launching
cage
checking
and
rechecking
every
possible
thing
that
could
make
for
the
success
of
its
flight
to
space
the
other
three
were
ready
haney
and
chief
bender
and
mike
scandia
they
were
especially
entitled
to
be
the
crew
of
this
first
supply
ship
when
the
platform
was
being
built
its
had
been
built
by
a
precision
tool
firm
owned
by
joe
father
he
gone
by
plane
with
the
infinitely
precise
apparatus
to
bootstrap
to
deliver
and
install
it
in
the
platform
and
the
plane
was
sabotaged
and
the
gyros
were
ruined
they
consumed
four
months
in
the
building
and
four
months
more
for
balancing
with
absolute
accuracy
the
platform
could
wait
so
long
for
duplicates
so
joe
had
improvised
a
method
of
repair
and
with
haney
to
devise
special
setups
and
the
chief
to
use
fanatically
fine
workmanship
and
mike
and
joe
aiding
according
to
their
gifts
they
rebuilt
the
apparatus
in
an
impossibly
short
time
the
original
notion
was
joe
but
he
have
done
the
job
without
the
others
and
there
had
been
other
incidental
triumphs
by
the
team
of
four
they
were
not
the
only
ones
who
worked
feverishly
for
the
glory
of
having
helped
to
build
the
earth
first
artificial
moon
but
they
had
accomplished
more
than
most
joe
had
even
been
appointed
to
be
an
alternate
member
of
the
platform
crew
but
the
man
he
was
to
have
substituted
for
recovered
from
an
illness
and
joe
was
left
behind
at
the
platform
launching
but
all
of
them
had
rated
some
reward
and
it
was
to
serve
in
the
small
ships
that
would
supply
the
satellite
now
they
were
ready
to
begin
the
chief
grinned
exuberantly
as
joe
ducked
through
the
bars
of
the
launching
cage
and
approached
the
ship
he
was
a
mohawk
indian
one
of
that
tribe
which
for
two
generations
had
supplied
steel
workers
to
every
bridge
and
dam
and
skyscraper
job
on
the
continent
he
was
brown
and
bulky
and
explosive
haney
looked
tense
and
strained
he
was
tall
and
lean
and
spare
and
a
good
man
in
any
sort
of
trouble
mike
blazed
excitement
mike
was
inches
high
and
he
was
he
had
worked
on
the
platform
bucking
rivets
and
making
welds
and
inspections
in
places
too
small
for
a
man
to
reach
he
frantically
resented
any
concessions
to
his
size
and
he
was
as
good
a
man
as
any
he
simply
was
the
small
economy
size
hiya
joe
boomed
the
chief
all
set
had
breakfast
joe
nodded
he
began
to
ask
anxious
questions
about
fuel
and
the
launching
cage
release
and
the
rockets
and
the
reduction
valve
from
the
air
tanks
he
thought
of
that
on
the
way
over
and
the
short
wave
and
loran
and
radar
haney
nodded
to
some
questions
mike
said
briskly
i
checked
to
others
the
chief
grunted
amiably
look
joe
we
checked
everything
last
night
we
checked
it
again
this
morning
i
even
caught
mike
polishing
the
ejection
seats
because
there
was
anything
else
to
make
sure
of
joe
managed
a
smile
the
ejection
seats
were
assuredly
the
most
unlikely
of
all
devices
to
be
useful
today
they
were
supposedly
devices
if
the
ship
came
a
cropper
on
the
four
of
them
were
supposed
to
use
like
those
supplied
to
jet
pilots
they
would
be
thrown
clear
of
the
ship
and
might
open
and
might
let
them
land
alive
but
it
was
likely
joe
had
objected
to
their
presence
if
a
feather
dropped
to
earth
from
a
height
of
miles
it
would
be
falling
so
fast
when
it
hit
the
atmosphere
that
it
would
heat
up
and
burn
to
ashes
from
pure
it
was
likely
that
they
could
get
out
of
the
ship
if
anything
went
wrong
somebody
marched
stiffly
toward
the
four
of
them
joe
expression
grew
rueful
the
space
project
was
neither
army
nor
navy
nor
air
corps
but
something
that
so
far
was
its
own
individual
self
but
the
man
marching
toward
joe
was
lieutenant
commander
brown
strictly
navy
assigned
to
the
shed
as
an
observer
and
there
were
some
times
when
he
baffled
joe
like
now
he
halted
and
looked
as
if
he
expected
joe
to
salute
joe
did
lieutenant
commander
brown
said
formally
i
would
like
to
offer
my
best
wishes
for
your
trip
mr
kenmore
thanks
said
joe
brown
smiled
distantly
you
understand
of
course
that
i
consider
navigation
essentially
a
naval
function
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
any
ship
including
a
spaceship
should
be
manned
by
naval
personnel
but
i
assuredly
wish
you
good
fortune
thanks
said
joe
again
brown
shook
hands
then
stalked
off
haney
rumbled
in
his
throat
how
come
joe
he
does
wish
all
of
us
good
luck
he
does
said
joe
but
his
mind
in
uniform
too
he
been
trained
that
way
i
like
to
make
a
bet
that
we
have
him
as
a
passenger
out
to
the
platform
some
day
heaven
forbid
growled
haney
there
was
an
outrageous
tumult
outside
the
gap
in
the
wall
something
went
shrieking
by
the
doorway
it
looked
like
the
magnified
top
half
of
a
loaf
of
baker
bread
painted
gray
and
equipped
with
an
in
front
and
a
plastic
bubble
for
a
pilot
it
howled
like
a
lost
baby
dragon
its
flat
underside
tilted
up
and
up
until
it
was
almost
vertical
it
had
no
wings
but
a
flame
spurted
out
of
its
rear
wobbling
from
side
to
side
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
it
was
a
pushpot
which
could
not
possibly
be
called
a
jet
plane
because
it
could
not
possibly
fly
only
it
did
it
settled
down
on
its
tail
and
the
sparse
vegetation
burst
into
smoky
flame
and
shriveled
and
the
thing
still
shrieking
like
a
in
a
tunnel
flopped
flat
forward
with
a
resounding
it
was
abruptly
silent
but
the
total
noise
was
not
lessened
another
pushpot
came
soaring
wildly
into
view
making
hysterical
outcries
it
touched
and
banged
violently
to
earth
others
appeared
in
the
air
beyond
the
construction
shed
one
flopped
so
hard
on
landing
that
its
tail
rose
in
the
air
and
it
attempted
a
somersault
it
made
ten
times
more
noise
than
before
the
flame
from
its
tail
making
wild
gyrations
and
flopped
back
again
with
a
crash
two
others
rolled
over
on
their
sides
after
touching
ground
one
ended
up
on
its
back
like
a
wriggling
they
seemed
to
land
by
hundreds
but
their
number
was
actually
in
dozens
it
was
not
until
the
last
one
was
down
that
joe
could
make
himself
heard
the
pushpots
were
jet
motors
in
frames
and
metal
skin
with
jato
rocket
tubes
besides
their
engines
on
the
ground
they
were
quite
helpless
in
the
air
they
were
unbelievably
clumsy
they
were
actually
balanced
and
steered
by
vanes
in
the
blasts
of
their
jets
and
they
combined
the
absolute
maximum
of
sheer
thrust
with
the
irreducible
minimum
of
flyability
went
out
to
pick
them
up
joe
said
anxiously
we
better
check
our
flight
plan
again
we
have
to
know
it
absolutely
he
headed
across
the
floor
to
the
flight
data
board
he
passed
the
hull
of
another
ship
like
his
own
which
was
near
completion
and
the
bare
skeletons
of
two
others
which
needed
a
lot
of
work
yet
they
been
begun
at
distant
plants
and
then
hauled
here
on
monstrous
trailers
for
completion
the
wooden
mockup
of
the
design
for
all
the
ships
in
which
every
possible
arrangement
of
instruments
and
machinery
had
been
tested
out
lay
neglected
by
the
shed
wall
the
four
stood
before
the
flight
data
board
it
listed
the
readings
every
instrument
should
show
during
every
instant
of
the
flight
the
readings
had
been
calculated
with
infinite
care
and
joe
and
the
others
needed
to
know
them
rather
better
than
they
knew
their
multiplication
tables
once
they
started
out
they
would
have
time
to
wonder
if
everything
was
right
for
the
time
and
place
they
needed
to
know
they
stood
there
soaking
up
the
information
the
board
contained
forming
mental
pictures
of
it
making
as
sure
as
possible
that
any
one
of
them
would
spot
anything
wrong
the
instant
it
showed
up
and
would
instantly
know
what
had
to
be
done
about
it
a
gigantic
came
in
through
the
wide
doorway
it
dangled
a
pushpot
it
rolled
over
to
the
launching
cage
in
which
the
spaceship
lay
and
set
the
unwieldy
metal
object
against
that
cage
there
was
a
as
the
pushpot
caught
hold
of
the
magnetic
grapples
the
crane
went
out
again
passing
a
second
crane
carrying
a
second
pushpot
the
second
thing
was
presented
to
the
cage
it
stuck
fast
the
crane
went
out
for
more
major
holt
came
across
the
floor
of
the
shed
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
walk
the
distance
from
the
security
offices
to
the
launching
cage
when
he
got
there
he
looked
impatiently
around
his
daughter
sally
came
out
of
nowhere
and
blew
her
nose
as
if
she
been
crying
and
pointed
to
the
data
board
the
major
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
uneasily
at
her
she
regarded
him
with
some
defiance
the
major
spoke
to
her
sternly
they
waited
the
cranes
brought
in
more
pushpots
and
set
them
up
against
the
steel
launching
cage
the
ship
had
been
nearly
hidden
before
by
the
rocket
tubes
fastened
outside
its
hull
it
went
completely
out
of
sight
behind
the
metal
monsters
banked
about
it
the
major
looked
at
his
watch
and
the
group
about
the
data
board
they
moved
away
from
it
and
back
toward
the
ship
joe
saw
the
major
and
swerved
over
to
him
i
have
brought
you
said
the
major
in
an
official
voice
the
invoice
of
your
cargo
you
will
deliver
the
invoice
with
the
cargo
and
bring
back
proper
receipts
i
hope
said
joe
hope
said
sally
in
a
strained
tone
good
luck
joe
thanks
there
is
not
much
to
say
to
you
said
the
major
without
visible
emotion
of
course
the
next
crew
will
start
its
training
immediately
but
it
may
be
a
month
before
another
ship
can
take
off
it
is
extremely
desirable
that
you
reach
the
platform
today
yes
sir
said
joe
wrily
i
have
even
a
personal
motive
to
get
there
if
i
do
i
break
my
neck
the
major
ignored
the
comment
he
shook
hands
formally
and
marched
away
sally
smiled
up
at
joe
but
her
eyes
were
suddenly
full
of
tears
i
do
hope
everything
goes
all
right
joe
she
said
unsteadily
i
i
be
praying
for
you
i
can
use
some
of
that
too
admitted
joe
she
looked
at
her
hand
joe
ring
was
on
her
finger
wrapped
with
string
on
the
inside
of
the
band
to
make
it
fit
then
she
looked
up
again
and
was
crying
unashamedly
i
will
she
repeated
then
she
said
fiercely
i
do
care
if
somebody
looking
joe
it
time
for
you
to
go
in
the
ship
he
kissed
her
and
turned
and
went
quickly
to
the
peculiar
mass
of
clustered
pushpots
touching
and
almost
overlapping
each
other
he
ducked
under
and
looked
back
sally
waved
he
waved
back
then
he
climbed
up
the
ladder
into
pelican
one
cabin
somebody
pulled
the
ladder
away
and
scuttled
out
of
the
cage
the
others
were
in
their
places
joe
slowly
closed
the
door
from
the
cabin
to
the
outer
world
there
was
suddenly
a
cushioned
silence
about
him
out
the
ports
he
could
see
ahead
out
the
end
of
the
cage
through
the
monstrous
doorway
to
the
desert
beyond
overhead
he
could
see
the
dark
roof
of
the
shed
on
either
side
though
he
could
see
only
the
scratched
dented
flat
undersides
of
the
pushpots
ready
to
lift
the
ship
upward
you
can
start
on
the
pushpot
motors
haney
he
said
curtly
joe
moved
to
his
own
the
pilot
seat
haney
pushed
a
button
through
the
fabric
of
the
ship
came
the
muted
uproar
of
a
pushpot
engine
starting
haney
pushed
another
button
another
another
more
jet
engines
bellowed
the
tumult
in
the
shed
would
be
past
endurance
now
joe
strapped
himself
into
his
seat
he
made
sure
that
the
chief
at
the
manual
controls
was
fastened
properly
and
mike
at
the
radio
panel
was
firmly
belted
past
the
chance
of
injury
haney
said
with
enormous
calm
all
pushpot
motors
running
joe
steering
rockets
ready
the
chief
reported
radio
operating
came
from
mike
communications
room
all
set
joe
reached
to
the
maneuver
controls
he
should
have
been
sweating
his
hands
perhaps
should
have
quivered
with
tension
but
he
was
too
much
worried
about
too
many
things
nobody
can
strike
an
attitude
or
go
into
a
blue
funk
while
they
are
worrying
about
things
to
be
done
joe
heard
the
small
gyro
motors
as
their
speed
went
up
a
hum
and
a
whine
and
then
a
shrill
whistle
which
went
up
in
pitch
until
it
was
anything
at
all
he
frowned
anxiously
and
said
to
haney
i
taking
over
the
pushpots
haney
nodded
joe
took
the
control
the
roar
of
engines
outside
grew
loud
on
the
side
and
died
down
it
grew
thunderous
to
the
left
and
dwindled
the
ones
ahead
pushed
then
the
ones
behind
joe
nodded
and
wet
his
lips
he
said
here
we
go
there
was
no
more
ceremony
than
that
the
noise
of
the
jet
motors
outside
rose
to
a
thunderous
volume
which
came
even
through
the
little
ship
insulated
hull
then
it
grew
louder
and
louder
still
and
joe
stirred
the
controls
by
ever
so
tiny
a
movement
suddenly
the
ship
did
not
feel
solid
it
stirred
a
little
joe
held
his
breath
and
cracked
the
control
of
the
pushpots
speed
a
tiny
trace
further
the
ship
wobbled
a
little
out
the
windows
the
great
door
seemed
to
descend
in
reality
the
clustered
pushpots
and
the
launching
cage
rose
some
thirty
feet
from
the
shed
floor
and
hovered
there
uncertainly
joe
shifted
the
lever
that
governed
the
vanes
in
the
jet
motor
blasts
ship
and
cage
and
pushpots
all
together
wavered
toward
the
doorway
they
passed
out
of
it
rocking
a
little
and
pitching
a
little
and
wallowing
a
little
as
a
flying
device
the
combination
was
a
howling
tumult
and
a
horror
it
was
an
aviation
designer
nightmare
it
was
a
bad
dream
by
any
standard
but
it
was
meant
as
a
way
to
fly
from
one
place
to
another
on
earth
it
was
the
first
booster
stage
of
a
rocket
aimed
at
outer
space
it
looked
rather
like
well
if
a
swarm
of
bumblebees
clung
fiercely
to
a
cage
in
which
lay
a
silver
minnow
wrapped
in
and
if
the
bees
buzzed
furiously
and
lifted
it
in
a
straining
clumsy
and
altogether
unreasonable
manner
and
if
the
appearance
and
the
noise
together
were
multiplied
a
good
many
thousands
of
times
why
it
would
present
a
great
similarity
to
the
of
the
spaceship
under
joe
command
nothing
like
it
could
be
graceful
or
neatly
controllable
or
even
very
speedy
in
the
thick
atmosphere
near
the
ground
but
higher
it
would
be
another
matter
it
another
matter
once
clear
of
the
shed
and
with
flat
sere
desert
ahead
to
the
very
horizon
joe
threw
on
full
power
to
the
pushpot
motors
the
aggregation
of
grotesque
objects
began
to
climb
ungainly
it
was
and
clumsy
it
was
but
it
went
upward
at
a
rate
a
might
have
trouble
matching
it
wobbled
and
it
swung
around
and
around
and
it
tipped
crazily
the
whole
aggregation
of
jet
motors
and
cage
and
burden
of
spaceship
as
a
unit
but
it
rose
the
ground
dropped
so
swiftly
that
even
the
shed
seemed
to
shrivel
like
a
pricked
balloon
the
horizon
retreated
as
if
a
carpet
were
hastily
unrolled
by
magic
the
barometric
pressure
needles
turned
communications
says
our
is
feet
a
minute
and
going
up
fast
mike
announced
it
five
we
at
feet
we
should
get
some
eastward
velocity
at
feet
our
height
is
now
feet
there
was
no
change
in
the
feel
of
things
inside
the
ship
of
course
sealed
against
the
vacuum
of
space
barometric
pressure
outside
made
no
difference
height
had
no
effect
on
the
air
inside
the
ship
at
feet
the
chief
said
suddenly
we
pointed
due
east
joe
freeze
it
right
said
joe
freeze
it
the
chief
threw
a
lever
the
gyros
were
running
at
full
operating
speed
by
engaging
them
the
chief
had
all
their
kinetic
energy
available
to
resist
any
change
of
direction
the
pushpots
might
produce
by
minor
variations
in
their
thrusts
haney
brooded
over
the
reports
from
the
individual
engines
outside
he
made
minute
adjustments
to
keep
them
balanced
mike
uttered
curt
comments
into
the
communicator
from
time
to
time
at
feet
there
was
a
momentary
sensation
as
if
the
ship
were
tilted
sharply
it
was
the
instruments
denied
any
change
from
level
rise
the
complex
of
flying
things
had
simply
risen
into
a
one
of
those
wildly
rushing
of
the
upper
atmosphere
eastern
velocity
four
hundred
said
mike
from
the
communicator
now
there
was
a
wind
behind
them
a
west
to
east
the
pushpots
struggled
now
to
get
the
maximum
possible
forward
thrust
before
they
rose
out
of
that
hurricane
they
added
a
fierce
push
to
eastward
to
their
upward
thrust
mike
cracked
voice
reported
miles
an
hour
presently
it
was
at
feet
they
were
moving
eastward
at
miles
an
hour
a
can
not
be
rated
except
indirectly
but
there
was
over
horsepower
at
work
to
raise
the
spacecraft
and
build
up
the
highest
possible
forward
speed
it
could
be
kept
up
of
course
the
pushpots
could
carry
enough
fuel
but
they
reached
feet
which
is
where
space
begins
for
humankind
a
man
exposed
to
emptiness
at
that
height
will
die
just
as
quickly
as
anywhere
between
the
stars
but
it
was
quite
empty
space
for
the
pushpots
there
was
still
a
very
very
little
air
the
pushpots
could
still
thrust
upward
feebly
now
but
they
still
thrust
mike
said
communications
says
get
set
to
fire
jatos
joe
right
he
replied
set
yourselves
mike
flung
a
switch
and
a
voice
began
to
chatter
behind
joe
head
it
was
the
voice
from
the
atop
the
shed
now
far
below
and
far
behind
mike
settled
himself
in
the
tiny
built
for
him
the
chief
squirmed
to
comfort
in
his
seat
haney
took
his
hands
from
the
equalizing
adjustments
he
had
to
make
so
that
joe
use
of
the
controls
would
be
exact
regardless
of
differences
in
the
thrust
of
the
various
jets
we
got
a
yaw
right
said
the
chief
sharply
hold
it
joe
joe
waited
for
small
quivering
needles
to
return
to
their
proper
registrations
back
and
steady
said
the
chief
a
moment
later
okay
the
tinny
voice
behind
joe
now
spoke
precisely
mike
had
listened
to
it
while
the
work
of
could
be
divided
so
that
joe
would
not
be
distracted
now
joe
had
to
control
everything
at
once
the
roar
of
the
pushpots
outside
the
ship
had
long
since
lost
the
volume
and
timbre
of
normal
atmosphere
not
much
sound
could
be
transmitted
by
the
outside
but
the
jet
motors
did
roar
and
the
sound
which
was
not
sound
at
such
a
height
was
transmitted
by
the
metal
cage
as
so
much
pure
vibration
the
walls
and
hull
of
the
spaceship
picked
up
a
crawling
quivering
pulsation
and
turned
it
into
sound
standing
waves
set
up
and
dissolved
and
moved
erratically
in
the
air
of
the
cabin
joe
eardrums
were
strangely
affected
now
one
ear
seemed
muted
by
a
temporary
difference
of
air
pressure
where
a
standing
wave
lingered
for
a
second
or
two
then
the
other
eardrum
itched
there
were
creeping
sensations
as
of
things
touching
one
and
quickly
moving
away
joe
swung
a
microphone
into
place
before
his
mouth
all
set
he
said
evenly
brief
me
the
tinny
voice
said
are
at
feet
your
curve
of
is
flattening
out
you
are
now
rising
at
speed
and
not
much
more
forward
velocity
can
be
anticipated
you
have
an
relative
to
surface
of
miles
per
hour
the
rotational
speed
of
earth
at
this
latitude
is
you
have
then
a
total
orbital
speed
of
miles
per
hour
or
nearly
twelve
per
cent
of
your
needed
final
velocity
since
you
will
take
off
laterally
and
practically
without
air
resistance
a
margin
of
safety
remains
you
are
authorized
to
joe
said
ten
seconds
nine
eight
seven
six
five
four
three
two
one
he
stabbed
the
master
jato
switch
and
a
monstrous
jato
rocket
built
into
each
and
every
one
of
the
pushpots
outside
flared
chemical
fumes
in
a
simultaneous
gigantic
thrust
a
small
jato
for
will
weigh
a
hundred
and
forty
pounds
and
deliver
a
thousand
pounds
of
thrust
for
fourteen
seconds
and
that
is
for
rockets
using
nonpoisonous
compounds
the
jatos
of
the
pushpots
used
the
fuel
that
had
lifted
the
platform
and
that
filled
the
rockets
of
joe
ship
these
jatos
gave
the
pushpots
themselves
an
acceleration
of
ten
gravities
but
it
had
to
be
shared
with
the
cage
and
the
ship
still
joe
felt
himself
slammed
back
into
his
seat
with
irresistible
overwhelming
force
the
vibration
from
the
jets
had
been
bad
now
he
did
notice
it
he
did
notice
much
of
anything
but
the
horrible
sensations
of
acceleration
it
was
not
exactly
pain
it
was
a
feeling
as
if
a
completely
intolerable
and
unbearable
pressure
pushed
at
him
not
only
on
the
outside
like
a
blow
but
inside
too
like
nothing
else
imaginable
not
only
his
chest
pressed
upon
his
lungs
but
his
lungs
strained
toward
his
backbone
not
only
the
flesh
of
his
thighs
tugged
to
flatten
itself
against
his
but
the
blood
in
his
legs
tried
to
flow
into
and
burst
the
in
the
back
of
his
legs
the
acceleration
seemed
to
endure
for
centuries
actually
it
lasted
for
fourteen
seconds
in
that
time
it
increased
the
speed
of
the
little
ship
by
rather
more
than
half
a
mile
per
second
something
over
miles
per
hour
before
the
ship
had
possessed
an
orbital
speed
of
a
shade
over
miles
an
hour
after
the
jato
thrust
it
was
traveling
nearly
miles
per
hour
it
needed
to
travel
something
over
miles
per
hour
to
reach
the
artificial
satellite
of
earth
the
intolerable
thrust
ended
abruptly
joe
gasped
but
he
could
allow
himself
only
a
shake
of
the
head
to
clear
his
brain
he
jammed
down
the
rocket
firing
button
there
was
a
monstrous
noise
and
a
mighty
surging
and
haney
panted
clear
of
cage
and
then
they
were
pressed
fiercely
against
their
acceleration
chairs
again
the
ship
was
no
longer
in
its
launching
cage
it
was
no
longer
upheld
by
pushpots
it
was
free
with
its
rockets
flaming
it
plunged
on
up
and
out
but
the
acceleration
was
less
nobody
can
stand
six
gravities
for
long
anybody
can
take
three
for
a
while
joe
body
resisted
movement
with
a
weight
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
instead
of
a
third
as
much
for
normal
his
heart
had
to
pump
against
three
times
the
normal
resistance
of
gravity
his
chest
felt
as
if
it
had
a
leaden
weight
on
it
his
tongue
tried
to
crowd
the
back
of
his
mouth
and
strangle
him
the
sensation
was
that
of
a
nightmare
of
impossible
duration
it
was
possible
to
move
and
possible
to
see
one
could
breathe
with
difficulty
and
with
titanic
effort
one
could
speak
but
there
was
the
same
feeling
of
stifling
resistance
to
every
movement
that
comes
in
nightmares
but
joe
managed
to
keep
his
eyes
focused
the
dials
of
the
instruments
said
that
everything
was
right
the
tinny
voice
behind
his
head
its
timbre
changed
by
the
weighting
of
its
diaphragm
said
readings
check
within
accuracy
of
instruments
good
work
joe
moved
his
eyes
to
a
quartz
window
the
sky
was
black
but
there
were
stars
bright
stars
against
a
black
background
at
the
same
instant
he
saw
the
bright
white
disks
of
sunshine
that
came
in
the
cabin
portholes
stars
and
sunshine
together
and
the
sunshine
was
the
sunshine
of
space
even
with
the
polarizers
cutting
off
some
of
the
glare
it
was
unbearably
bright
and
hot
beyond
conception
he
smelled
overheated
paint
where
the
sunlight
smote
on
a
metal
bulkhead
stars
and
sunshine
together
it
was
necessary
to
pant
for
breath
and
his
heart
pounded
horribly
and
his
eyes
tried
to
go
out
of
focus
but
joe
kenmore
strained
in
his
and
managed
to
laugh
a
little
we
did
it
he
panted
in
case
you
did
notice
we
out
of
the
atmosphere
and
out
in
space
we
headed
to
join
the
space
platform
the
pressure
of
three
gravities
continued
joe
chest
muscles
ached
with
the
exertion
of
breathing
over
so
long
a
period
six
gravities
for
fourteen
seconds
had
been
a
ghastly
ordeal
three
gravities
for
minutes
built
up
to
something
nearly
as
bad
joe
heart
began
to
feel
fatigue
and
a
man
heart
normally
simply
does
ever
feel
tired
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
see
clearly
but
he
had
work
to
do
important
work
the
rockets
were
jobs
like
those
which
launched
the
platform
they
were
steel
tubes
lined
with
a
very
special
refractory
with
unstable
beryllium
and
fluorine
compounds
in
them
the
solid
fuel
burned
at
so
many
inches
per
second
the
refractory
crumbled
away
and
was
hurled
astern
at
a
corresponding
rate
save
for
one
small
point
the
refractory
was
not
all
exactly
alike
some
parts
of
it
crumbled
away
faster
leaving
a
pattern
of
baffles
which
acted
like
a
maxim
silencer
on
a
rifle
or
like
an
automobile
muffler
the
baffles
set
up
eddies
in
the
gas
stream
and
produced
exactly
the
effect
of
a
rocket
throat
but
the
baffles
themselves
crumbled
and
were
flung
astern
so
that
the
rockets
had
always
the
efficiency
of
rocket
motors
and
yet
every
bit
of
refractory
was
to
be
hurled
astern
and
even
the
steel
tubes
melted
and
were
hurled
away
with
a
gain
in
acceleration
to
the
ship
every
fraction
of
every
ounce
of
rocket
mass
was
used
for
drive
no
tanks
or
pumps
or
burners
rode
deadhead
after
they
ceased
to
be
useful
but
rockets
simply
ca
be
made
to
burn
with
absolute
evenness
as
a
team
minute
differences
in
do
tend
to
cancel
out
but
now
and
again
they
reinforce
each
other
and
if
uncorrected
will
throw
a
ship
off
course
gyros
ca
handle
such
effects
so
joe
had
to
watch
his
instruments
and
listen
to
the
tinny
voice
behind
him
and
steer
the
ship
against
accidental
wobblings
as
the
earth
fell
away
behind
him
he
battled
against
the
fatigue
of
continuing
to
live
and
struggled
with
gyros
and
steering
jets
to
keep
the
ship
on
its
course
he
panted
heavily
the
beating
of
his
heart
became
such
a
heavy
pounding
that
it
seemed
that
his
whole
body
shook
with
it
he
had
to
do
infinitely
fine
precision
steering
with
hands
that
weighed
pounds
and
arms
that
weighed
scores
of
pounds
and
a
body
that
had
an
effective
weight
of
almost
a
quarter
of
a
ton
and
this
went
on
and
went
on
and
on
for
what
seemed
several
centuries
then
the
voice
in
the
speaker
said
thickly
is
in
the
clear
in
ten
seconds
you
can
release
your
rockets
shall
i
count
joe
panted
count
the
mechanical
voice
said
six
five
four
three
two
one
cut
joe
pressed
the
release
the
small
unburnt
stubs
of
the
rockets
went
hurtling
off
toward
emptiness
they
consumed
themselves
as
they
went
and
they
attained
an
acceleration
of
fifty
gravities
once
they
were
relieved
of
all
load
but
their
own
substance
they
had
to
be
released
lest
one
burn
longer
than
another
it
was
also
the
only
way
to
stop
acceleration
by
rockets
they
could
be
extinguished
they
had
to
be
released
from
intolerably
burdensome
heaviness
there
was
abruptly
no
weight
at
all
in
the
ship
joe
laboring
heart
beat
twice
with
the
violence
the
weight
had
called
for
though
weight
had
ended
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
skull
would
crack
open
during
those
two
then
he
lay
limply
resting
there
was
a
completely
incredible
stillness
for
a
time
the
four
of
them
panted
haney
was
better
off
than
joe
but
the
chief
was
harder
hit
mike
small
body
had
taken
the
strain
best
of
all
and
he
would
use
the
fact
later
in
shrill
argument
that
midgets
were
designed
by
nature
to
be
the
explorers
of
space
for
their
bulkier
and
less
spaceworthy
kindred
the
ending
of
the
steady
punishing
drag
was
infinitely
good
but
the
new
sensation
was
hardly
pleasant
they
had
no
weight
it
felt
as
if
they
and
the
ship
about
them
were
falling
together
down
an
abyss
which
must
have
a
bottom
actually
they
were
falling
up
but
they
felt
a
physical
crawling
apprehension
a
cringing
from
an
imaginary
imminent
impact
they
had
expected
the
sensation
but
it
was
not
the
better
for
being
understood
joe
flexed
and
unflexed
his
fingers
slowly
he
stirred
and
swallowed
hastily
but
the
feeling
persisted
he
unstrapped
himself
from
his
seat
he
stood
up
and
floated
to
the
ceiling
of
the
cabin
but
there
was
of
course
no
ceiling
every
way
was
up
and
every
way
was
down
his
stomach
cramped
itself
in
a
hard
knot
in
the
instinctive
tensity
of
somebody
in
free
fall
he
fended
himself
from
the
ceiling
and
caught
at
a
placed
there
for
just
this
necessity
to
grip
something
in
his
absorption
he
did
not
notice
which
way
his
heels
went
he
suddenly
noticed
that
his
companions
with
regard
to
him
were
upside
down
and
staring
at
him
with
wooden
dazed
expressions
on
their
faces
he
tried
to
laugh
and
gulped
instead
he
pulled
over
to
the
ports
he
did
not
put
his
hand
into
the
sunlight
but
shifted
the
glare
shutters
over
those
ports
which
admitted
direct
sunshine
some
ports
remained
clear
through
one
of
them
he
saw
the
earth
seemingly
at
arm
length
somewhere
off
not
up
not
down
simply
out
from
where
he
was
it
filled
all
the
space
that
the
porthole
showed
it
was
a
gigantic
mass
of
white
fleecy
specks
and
spots
which
would
be
clouds
and
between
the
whiteness
there
was
a
muddy
dark
greenish
color
which
would
be
the
ocean
yet
it
seemed
to
slide
very
very
slowly
past
the
window
he
saw
a
tanness
between
the
clouds
and
it
moved
inward
from
the
edge
of
his
field
of
view
he
suddenly
realized
what
it
was
we
just
about
crossed
the
atlantic
he
said
in
a
peculiar
astonishment
but
it
was
true
the
ship
had
not
been
aloft
nearly
as
much
as
half
an
hour
africa
just
coming
into
sight
below
we
ought
to
be
about
miles
high
and
still
rising
fast
that
was
the
calculation
he
looked
again
and
then
drew
himself
across
to
the
opposite
porthole
he
saw
the
blackness
of
space
which
was
not
blackness
because
it
was
a
carpet
of
jewels
they
were
infinite
in
number
and
variations
in
brightness
and
somehow
of
vastly
more
colorings
than
one
noticed
from
earth
he
heard
the
chief
grunt
and
haney
gulp
he
was
suddenly
conscious
that
his
legs
were
floating
rather
ridiculously
in
with
no
particular
relationship
to
anything
he
saw
the
chief
rise
very
cautiously
holding
on
to
the
arms
of
his
seat
better
not
look
at
the
sun
said
joe
even
though
i
put
on
the
the
chief
nodded
the
would
keep
out
most
of
the
heat
and
a
very
great
deal
of
the
ultraviolet
the
sun
gave
off
but
even
so
to
look
at
the
sun
directly
might
easily
result
in
a
retinal
sunburn
which
could
result
in
blindness
the
loudspeaker
behind
joe
chair
clattered
it
had
seemed
muted
by
the
weight
of
its
diaphragm
at
three
gravities
now
it
blasted
unintelligibly
with
no
weight
at
all
mike
threw
a
switch
and
took
the
message
communications
says
radar
says
we
right
on
course
joe
he
reported
nonchalantly
and
our
speed
okay
we
reach
maximum
altitude
in
an
hour
and
minutes
we
ought
to
be
within
calculated
distance
of
the
platform
then
good
said
joe
abstractedly
he
strained
his
eyes
at
the
earth
they
were
moving
at
an
extraordinary
speed
and
height
it
had
been
reached
by
just
four
human
beings
before
them
the
tannishness
which
was
the
coast
of
africa
crept
with
astonishing
slowness
toward
the
center
of
what
he
could
see
joe
headed
back
to
his
seat
he
could
not
walk
of
course
he
floated
he
launched
himself
with
a
fine
air
of
confidence
he
misjudged
he
was
floating
past
his
chair
when
he
reached
down
and
that
turned
his
body
and
fumbled
wildly
he
caught
hold
of
the
back
as
he
went
by
then
held
on
and
found
himself
turning
a
grandly
dignified
somersault
he
wound
up
in
a
remarkably
foolish
position
with
the
back
of
his
neck
on
the
back
of
the
chair
his
arms
in
a
highly
strained
position
to
hold
him
there
and
his
feet
touching
the
deck
of
the
cabin
a
good
five
feet
away
haney
looked
greenish
but
he
said
hoarsely
joe
do
make
me
laugh
not
when
my
stomach
feels
like
this
the
feeling
of
weightlessness
was
unexpectedly
daunting
joe
turned
himself
about
very
slowly
with
his
legs
floating
indecorously
in
entirely
unintended
kicks
he
was
breathing
hard
when
he
pulled
himself
into
the
chair
and
strapped
in
once
more
i
take
communications
he
told
mike
as
he
settled
his
headphones
reluctantly
mike
switched
over
kenmore
reporting
to
communications
he
said
briefly
we
have
ended
our
acceleration
you
have
our
course
and
velocity
our
instruments
read
he
went
over
the
bank
of
instruments
before
him
giving
the
indication
of
each
in
a
sense
this
first
trip
of
a
ship
out
to
the
platform
had
some
of
the
aspects
of
defusing
a
bomb
calculations
were
useful
but
observations
were
necessary
he
had
to
report
every
detail
of
the
condition
of
his
ship
and
every
because
anything
might
go
wrong
and
at
any
instant
anything
that
went
wrong
could
be
fatal
so
every
bit
of
data
and
every
intended
action
needed
to
be
on
record
then
if
something
happened
the
next
ship
to
attempt
this
journey
might
avoid
the
same
catastrophe
time
passed
a
lot
of
time
the
feeling
of
unending
fall
continued
they
knew
what
it
was
but
they
had
to
keep
thinking
of
its
cause
to
endure
it
joe
found
that
if
his
mind
concentrated
fully
on
something
else
it
jerked
back
to
panic
and
the
feel
of
falling
but
the
crew
of
the
space
platform
now
out
in
space
for
more
weeks
than
joe
had
been
reported
that
one
got
partly
used
to
it
in
time
when
awake
at
least
asleep
was
another
matter
they
were
miles
high
and
still
going
out
and
up
the
earth
as
seen
through
the
ports
was
still
an
utterly
monstrous
bulging
mass
specked
with
clouds
above
vast
mottlings
which
were
its
seas
and
land
they
might
have
looked
for
cities
but
they
would
be
mere
patches
in
a
telescope
their
task
now
was
to
wait
until
their
orbit
curved
into
accordance
with
that
of
the
platform
and
they
kept
their
rendezvous
the
artificial
satellite
was
swinging
up
behind
them
and
was
only
a
about
earth
behind
them
their
speed
in
miles
per
second
was
at
the
moment
greater
than
that
of
the
platform
but
they
were
climbing
they
slowed
as
they
climbed
when
their
path
intersected
that
of
the
platform
the
two
velocities
should
be
exactly
equal
major
holt
voice
came
on
the
communicator
he
said
harshly
have
very
bad
news
a
message
came
from
central
intelligence
within
minutes
of
your
i
ah
with
sally
i
had
been
following
your
progress
i
did
not
decode
the
message
until
now
but
central
intelligence
has
definite
information
that
more
than
ten
days
ago
the
ah
enemies
of
our
space
exploration
even
on
a
tight
beam
to
the
small
spaceship
major
holt
did
not
name
the
nation
everybody
knew
was
most
desperately
resolved
to
smash
space
exploration
by
anybody
but
itself
at
least
one
rocket
capable
of
reaching
the
platform
orbit
with
a
that
could
be
an
atomic
bomb
it
is
believed
that
more
than
one
rocket
was
completed
all
were
shipped
to
an
unknown
launching
not
so
good
said
joe
mike
had
left
his
post
when
joe
took
over
now
he
made
a
swooping
dart
through
the
air
of
the
cabin
the
midget
showed
no
signs
of
the
fumbling
uncertainty
the
others
had
displayed
but
he
been
a
member
of
a
midget
acrobatic
team
before
he
went
to
work
at
the
shed
he
brought
himself
to
a
stop
precisely
at
a
grinning
triumphantly
at
the
nearly
helpless
chief
and
haney
major
holt
said
in
the
headphones
worse
than
that
radar
may
have
told
the
country
in
question
that
you
are
on
the
way
up
in
that
case
if
it
even
faintly
possible
to
blast
the
platform
before
your
arrival
with
weapons
for
its
defense
they
i
do
like
that
idea
said
joe
dourly
anything
we
can
do
major
holt
laughed
bitterly
he
said
do
you
realize
that
if
you
ca
unload
your
cargo
you
ca
get
back
to
earth
yes
said
joe
naturally
it
was
true
the
purpose
of
the
pushpots
and
the
jatos
and
the
own
rockets
had
been
to
give
it
a
speed
at
which
it
would
inevitably
rise
to
a
height
of
miles
the
orbit
of
the
space
platform
and
stay
there
it
would
need
no
power
to
remain
miles
out
from
earth
but
it
would
take
power
to
come
down
the
rockets
had
been
built
to
drive
the
ship
with
all
its
contents
until
it
attained
that
needed
orbital
velocity
there
were
landing
rockets
fastened
to
the
hull
now
to
slow
it
so
that
it
could
land
but
just
as
the
rockets
had
been
designed
to
lift
a
loaded
ship
the
had
been
designed
to
land
an
empty
one
the
more
weight
the
ship
carried
the
more
power
it
needed
to
get
out
to
the
platform
and
the
more
power
it
needed
to
come
down
again
if
joe
and
his
companions
could
get
rid
of
their
cargo
and
they
could
only
unload
in
the
of
the
platform
they
stay
out
in
emptiness
the
major
said
bitterly
is
all
most
irregular
but
then
sally
voice
sounded
in
the
headphones
joe
wore
he
was
relieved
that
mike
was
acting
as
communications
officer
at
the
moment
to
overhear
but
mike
was
zestfully
spinning
like
a
in
the
middle
of
the
air
of
the
control
cabin
he
was
showing
the
others
that
even
in
the
intramural
pastimes
a
spaceship
crew
will
indulge
in
a
midget
was
better
than
a
man
joe
said
yes
sally
she
said
unsteadily
not
going
to
waste
your
time
talking
to
you
joe
i
think
you
got
to
figure
out
something
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
it
is
but
i
think
you
can
do
it
try
will
you
i
afraid
we
going
to
have
to
trust
to
luck
admitted
joe
ruefully
we
were
equipped
for
anything
like
this
said
sally
fiercely
i
were
with
you
you
would
think
of
trusting
to
luck
i
would
want
to
admitted
joe
i
feel
responsible
but
just
the
same
responsible
now
said
sally
as
fiercely
as
before
the
platform
smashed
the
rockets
that
can
reach
it
will
be
duplicated
to
smash
our
cities
in
war
but
if
you
can
reach
the
platform
and
arm
it
for
defense
there
wo
be
any
war
half
the
world
would
be
praying
for
you
joe
if
it
knew
i
ca
do
anything
else
so
i
going
to
start
on
that
right
now
but
you
try
joe
you
hear
me
i
try
said
joe
humbly
thanks
sally
he
heard
a
sound
like
a
sob
and
the
headphones
were
silent
joe
himself
swallowed
very
carefully
it
can
be
alarming
to
be
the
object
of
an
intended
murder
but
it
can
also
be
very
thrilling
one
can
play
up
splendidly
to
a
dramatic
picture
of
doom
it
is
possible
to
be
one
own
audience
and
admire
one
own
fine
disregard
of
danger
but
when
other
lives
depend
on
one
one
has
the
irritating
obligation
not
to
strike
poses
but
to
do
something
practical
joe
said
somberly
mike
how
long
before
we
ought
to
contact
the
platform
mike
reached
out
a
small
hand
caught
a
and
flicked
his
eyes
to
the
master
chronometer
forty
minutes
fifty
seconds
why
joe
said
wrily
there
are
some
rockets
in
enemy
hands
which
can
reach
the
platform
they
were
shipped
to
launchers
ten
days
ago
you
figure
what
comes
next
mike
wizened
face
became
tense
and
angry
haney
growled
they
smash
the
platform
before
we
get
to
it
said
mike
instantly
they
smash
the
platform
we
get
to
it
they
smash
us
both
up
together
where
we
be
at
joe
over
the
indian
ocean
south
of
the
bay
of
bengal
to
be
exact
said
joe
but
we
be
moving
fast
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
going
to
take
time
to
get
in
the
airlock
and
unload
our
guided
missiles
and
get
them
in
the
platform
i
guess
an
hour
one
bomb
should
get
both
of
us
above
the
bay
of
bengal
but
we
wo
be
set
to
launch
a
guided
missile
in
defense
until
we
nearly
over
america
again
the
chief
said
sourly
yeah
sitting
ducks
all
the
way
across
the
pacific
we
check
with
the
platform
said
joe
see
if
you
can
get
them
direct
mike
will
you
then
something
occurred
to
him
mike
scrambled
back
to
his
communication
board
he
began
feverishly
to
work
the
computer
which
in
turn
would
swing
the
transmitter
to
the
target
the
computer
worked
out
he
threw
a
switch
and
said
sharply
calling
space
platform
pelican
one
calling
space
platform
come
in
space
platform
he
paused
calling
space
platform
joe
had
a
going
on
another
problem
he
looked
up
his
expression
peculiar
a
rocket
can
start
off
at
ten
gravities
acceleration
he
said
quietly
and
as
its
rockets
burn
away
it
can
go
up
a
lot
higher
than
that
but
miles
is
a
long
way
to
go
straight
up
if
it
launched
yet
mike
snapped
into
a
microphone
right
to
joe
he
said
space
platform
on
the
wire
joe
heard
an
acknowledgment
in
his
headphones
i
just
had
word
from
the
shed
he
explained
carefully
that
there
may
be
some
guided
missiles
coming
up
from
earth
to
smash
us
as
we
meet
you
still
higher
than
we
are
and
they
ought
to
be
starting
can
you
pick
up
anything
with
your
radar
the
voice
from
the
platform
said
have
picked
something
up
there
are
four
rockets
headed
out
from
near
the
in
the
pacific
assuming
rockets
like
we
used
and
you
used
they
are
on
a
collision
are
you
doing
anything
about
them
asked
joe
absurdly
the
voice
said
caustically
we
nothing
to
do
anything
it
paused
of
course
can
use
the
you
still
possess
if
you
fire
them
immediately
you
will
pass
our
scheduled
some
hundreds
of
miles
ahead
of
us
you
will
go
on
out
to
space
you
may
set
up
an
orbit
hundred
or
even
five
thousand
miles
out
and
wait
there
for
joe
said
briefly
we
air
for
only
four
days
that
no
good
be
a
month
before
the
next
ship
can
be
finished
and
take
off
there
are
four
rockets
coming
up
you
say
the
voice
changed
it
spoke
away
from
the
microphone
that
then
it
returned
to
joe
four
rockets
were
sent
up
at
the
same
instant
from
four
separate
launching
sites
probably
as
many
submarines
at
the
corners
of
a
square
so
an
accident
to
one
would
set
off
the
others
they
undoubtedly
converge
as
they
get
nearer
to
i
think
said
joe
that
we
need
some
luck
said
the
caustic
voice
we
run
out
of
there
was
a
click
joe
swallowed
again
the
three
members
of
his
crew
were
looking
at
him
somebody
fired
rockets
out
from
earth
said
joe
carefully
curve
together
where
we
meet
the
platform
and
get
there
just
when
we
do
the
chief
rumbled
haney
clamped
his
jaws
together
mike
expression
became
one
of
blazing
hatred
joe
mind
went
rather
absurdly
to
the
major
curious
almost
despairing
talk
in
his
quarters
that
morning
when
he
spoken
of
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
all
the
hopes
of
men
the
firing
of
rockets
at
the
platform
was
of
course
the
work
of
men
acting
deliberately
but
they
were
unconsciously
trying
to
destroy
their
own
best
hopes
for
freedom
certainly
whether
or
not
they
could
imagine
being
free
but
the
platform
and
the
space
exploration
project
in
general
meant
benefits
past
computing
for
everybody
in
time
to
send
ships
into
space
for
necessary
but
dangerous
experiments
with
atomic
energy
was
a
purpose
every
man
should
want
to
help
forward
to
bring
peace
on
earth
was
surely
an
objective
no
man
could
willingly
or
sanely
combat
and
the
ultimate
goal
of
space
travel
was
millions
of
other
planets
circling
other
suns
thrown
open
to
colonization
by
humanity
that
prospect
should
surely
fire
every
human
being
with
enthusiasm
but
something
and
the
more
one
thought
about
it
the
more
specific
and
deliberate
it
seemed
to
be
made
it
necessary
to
fight
desperately
against
men
in
order
to
benefit
them
joe
swallowed
again
it
would
have
been
comforting
to
be
dramatic
in
this
war
against
stupidity
and
malice
and
blindness
especially
since
this
particular
battle
seemed
to
be
lost
one
could
send
back
an
eloquent
defiant
message
to
earth
saying
that
the
four
of
them
did
not
regret
their
journey
into
space
though
they
were
doomed
to
be
killed
by
the
enemies
of
their
country
it
could
have
been
a
very
pretty
gesture
but
joe
happened
to
have
a
job
to
do
pretty
gestures
were
not
a
part
of
it
he
had
no
idea
how
to
do
it
so
he
said
rather
sickishly
the
platform
told
me
we
could
fire
our
as
additional
rockets
and
get
out
of
the
way
of
course
we
got
missiles
of
our
own
on
board
but
we
ca
launch
or
control
them
absolutely
the
only
thing
we
can
choose
to
do
or
not
do
is
fire
those
rockets
i
open
to
suggestions
if
anybody
can
think
of
a
way
to
make
them
useful
there
was
silence
joe
reasoning
was
good
enough
when
one
ca
do
what
he
wants
one
tries
to
make
what
he
can
do
produce
the
results
he
wants
but
it
did
look
too
promising
here
they
could
fire
the
rockets
now
or
later
or
an
idea
came
out
of
the
blue
it
was
a
good
idea
but
it
was
the
only
one
possible
under
the
circumstances
there
was
just
one
distinctly
remote
possibility
he
told
the
others
what
it
was
mike
eyes
flamed
the
chief
nodded
profoundly
haney
said
with
some
skepticism
it
all
we
got
we
got
to
use
it
i
need
some
calculations
spread
best
time
of
firing
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
worried
about
calling
back
in
the
clear
a
beam
to
the
platform
will
bounce
and
might
be
picked
up
by
the
enemy
the
chief
grinned
suddenly
i
got
a
trick
for
that
joe
there
a
tribesman
of
mine
in
the
shed
get
charley
red
fox
to
the
phone
guy
and
we
talk
privately
the
small
spaceship
floated
on
upward
it
pointed
steadfastly
in
the
direction
of
its
motion
the
glaring
sunshine
which
at
its
had
shone
squarely
in
its
now
poured
down
slantingly
from
behind
the
steel
plates
of
the
ship
gleamed
brightly
below
it
lay
the
sunlit
earth
above
and
about
it
on
every
hand
were
a
multitude
of
stars
even
the
moon
was
visible
as
the
thinnest
of
crescents
against
the
night
of
space
the
ship
climbed
steeply
it
was
meeting
the
platform
after
only
half
a
circuit
of
earth
while
the
platform
had
climbed
upward
for
three
full
revolutions
earth
was
now
miles
below
and
appeared
as
the
most
gigantic
of
possible
solid
objects
it
curved
away
and
away
to
mistiness
at
its
horizons
and
it
moved
visibly
as
the
spaceship
floated
on
invisible
microwaves
flung
arrowlike
through
emptiness
they
traveled
for
thousands
of
miles
spreading
as
they
traveled
and
then
struck
the
strange
shape
of
the
platform
they
splashed
from
it
some
of
them
rebounded
to
earth
where
spies
and
agents
of
foreign
powers
tried
desperately
to
make
sense
of
the
incredible
syllables
they
failed
there
was
a
relay
system
in
operation
now
from
spaceship
to
platform
to
earth
and
back
again
in
the
ship
chief
bender
mohawk
and
steelman
extraordinary
talked
to
the
shed
and
to
one
charley
red
fox
they
talked
in
mohawk
which
is
an
algonquin
indian
language
agglutinative
complicated
and
not
to
be
learned
in
ten
easy
lessons
it
was
not
a
language
which
eavesdroppers
were
likely
to
know
as
a
matter
of
course
but
it
was
a
language
by
which
computations
could
be
asked
for
so
that
a
very
forlorn
hope
might
be
attempted
with
the
best
possible
chances
of
success
naturally
none
of
this
appeared
in
the
look
of
things
the
small
ship
floated
on
and
on
it
reached
an
altitude
of
miles
the
earth
was
visibly
farther
away
behind
the
ship
the
atlantic
with
its
stately
was
sunlit
to
the
very
edge
of
its
being
ahead
the
edge
of
night
appeared
beyond
india
and
above
the
platform
appeared
as
a
speck
of
molten
light
by
the
sun
above
it
spaceship
and
platform
moved
on
toward
a
meeting
place
the
ship
moved
a
trifle
faster
because
it
was
climbing
the
speeds
would
match
exactly
when
they
met
the
small
shining
ship
and
the
bulging
glowing
metal
satellite
floated
with
a
seeming
vast
deliberation
in
emptiness
while
the
most
gigantic
of
possible
round
objects
filled
all
the
firmament
beneath
them
they
were
miles
apart
it
seemed
that
the
huge
platform
overtook
the
shining
ship
it
did
they
were
only
miles
apart
and
still
closing
in
by
that
time
the
twilight
band
of
earth
surface
was
nearly
at
the
center
of
the
planet
and
night
filled
more
than
a
quarter
of
its
disk
by
that
time
too
even
to
the
naked
eye
through
the
ports
of
the
the
enemy
rockets
had
become
visible
they
were
a
thin
skein
of
threads
of
white
vapor
which
seemed
to
unravel
in
nothingness
the
vapor
curled
and
expanded
preposterously
it
could
just
be
seen
to
be
jetting
into
existence
from
four
separate
points
two
a
little
ahead
of
the
others
they
came
out
from
earth
at
a
rate
which
seemed
remarkably
deliberate
until
one
saw
with
what
fury
the
spat
out
to
form
the
whitish
threads
then
one
could
guess
at
a
even
launching
series
so
that
what
appeared
to
be
mere
pinpoints
would
really
be
rockets
carrying
atomic
warheads
with
an
attained
velocity
of
miles
per
hour
and
more
straight
up
the
threads
unraveled
in
a
straight
line
aimed
at
the
two
metal
things
floating
in
emptiness
one
was
small
and
streamlined
with
inadequate
clamped
to
its
body
and
with
stubby
fins
that
had
no
possible
utility
out
of
air
the
other
was
large
and
clumsy
to
look
at
but
very
very
stately
indeed
in
its
progress
through
the
heavens
they
floated
smoothly
toward
a
rendezvous
the
rockets
from
earth
came
ravening
to
destroy
them
at
the
instant
of
their
intersection
the
little
spaceship
turned
slowly
its
rounded
bow
had
pointed
longingly
at
the
stars
now
it
tilted
downward
its
direction
of
movement
did
not
change
of
course
in
the
absence
of
air
it
could
tumble
indefinitely
without
any
ill
effect
it
was
in
a
trajectory
instead
of
on
a
course
though
presently
the
trajectory
would
become
an
orbit
but
it
pointed
toward
the
earth
even
as
it
continued
to
hurtle
onward
the
great
steel
hull
and
the
small
spaceship
were
miles
apart
an
infinitesimal
moved
on
the
little
ship
waves
flickered
invisibly
between
the
two
craft
the
rockets
raged
toward
them
the
ship
and
the
platform
were
miles
apart
the
rockets
were
now
glinting
missiles
leaping
ahead
of
the
fumes
that
propelled
them
the
ship
and
the
platform
were
two
miles
apart
the
rockets
rushed
upward
there
were
minute
corrections
in
their
courses
they
converged
flames
leaped
from
the
tiny
ship
its
spouted
flame
and
fumes
more
thick
and
coiling
than
even
the
smoke
of
the
bombs
the
little
ship
surged
momentarily
toward
the
racing
monsters
and
then
the
rockets
which
were
supposed
to
let
the
ship
down
to
earth
flew
free
flung
themselves
unburdened
at
the
rockets
which
came
with
deadly
intent
to
the
meeting
of
the
two
earth
spacecraft
the
plunged
down
at
forty
gravities
or
better
they
were
a
dwindling
group
of
infinitely
bright
sparks
which
seemed
to
group
themselves
more
closely
as
they
dwindled
they
charged
upon
the
attacking
robot
things
they
were
unguided
of
necessity
but
the
robot
bombs
had
to
be
equipped
with
proximity
fuses
no
remote
control
could
be
so
accurate
as
to
determine
the
best
moment
for
detonation
at
miles
distance
so
the
war
rockets
had
to
be
devised
to
explode
when
near
anything
which
reflected
their
probing
radar
waves
they
had
to
be
designed
to
be
triggered
by
anything
in
space
and
the
loosed
plunged
among
them
they
did
not
detonate
all
at
once
that
was
mathematically
impossible
but
no
human
eye
could
detect
the
delay
four
flares
of
pure
atomic
fire
sprang
into
being
between
the
platform
and
earth
each
was
brighter
than
the
sun
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
there
was
no
night
where
night
had
fallen
on
the
earth
for
thousands
of
miles
the
earth
glowed
brightly
then
there
was
a
twisting
coiling
tumult
of
incandescent
gases
which
were
snatched
away
by
nothingness
and
ceased
to
be
then
there
were
just
two
things
remaining
in
the
void
one
was
the
great
clumsy
shining
platform
gigantic
in
size
to
anything
close
by
the
other
was
the
small
spaceship
which
had
climbed
to
it
and
fought
for
it
and
defended
it
against
the
bombs
from
earth
the
little
ship
now
had
a
slight
motion
away
from
the
platform
due
to
the
instant
tugging
by
its
rockets
before
they
were
released
it
turned
about
in
emptiness
its
spouted
smoke
it
began
to
cancel
out
its
velocity
away
from
the
platform
and
to
swim
slowly
and
very
carefully
toward
it
making
actual
contact
with
the
platform
was
not
a
matter
for
instruments
and
calculations
it
had
to
be
done
directly
by
hand
as
it
were
joe
watched
out
the
ports
and
played
the
controls
of
the
steering
jets
with
a
precision
his
task
was
not
easy
before
he
could
return
to
the
point
of
rendezvous
the
blinding
sunlight
on
the
platform
took
on
a
tinge
of
red
it
was
the
of
the
satellite
orbit
when
for
a
time
the
sunlight
that
reached
it
was
light
which
had
passed
through
earth
atmosphere
and
been
bent
by
it
and
colored
crimson
by
the
dust
in
earth
air
it
glowed
a
fiery
red
and
the
color
deepened
and
then
there
was
darkness
they
were
in
earth
shadow
there
were
stars
to
be
seen
but
no
sun
the
moon
was
hidden
too
and
the
earth
was
a
monstrous
incredible
abysmal
blackness
which
at
this
first
experience
of
its
appearance
produced
an
almost
superstitious
terror
formerly
it
had
seemed
a
distant
but
sunlit
world
flecked
with
white
clouds
and
with
sprawling
differentiations
of
color
beneath
them
now
it
did
not
look
like
a
solid
thing
at
all
it
looked
like
a
hole
in
creation
one
could
see
ten
thousand
million
stars
of
every
imaginable
tint
and
shade
but
where
the
earth
should
be
there
seemed
a
vast
nothingness
it
looked
like
an
opening
to
annihilation
it
looked
like
the
veritable
pit
of
darkness
which
is
the
greatest
horror
men
have
ever
imagined
and
since
those
in
the
ship
were
without
weight
it
seemed
that
they
were
falling
into
it
joe
knew
better
of
course
so
did
the
others
but
that
was
the
look
of
things
and
that
was
the
feeling
one
did
not
feel
in
danger
of
death
but
of
extinction
which
in
cold
fact
is
very
much
worse
lights
glowed
on
the
outside
of
the
platform
to
guide
the
supply
ship
to
it
there
were
red
and
green
and
blue
and
harsh
electric
bulbs
they
were
bright
and
distinct
but
the
feeling
of
loneliness
above
that
awful
appearance
of
the
pit
was
appalling
no
small
child
alone
at
night
had
ever
so
desolate
a
sensation
of
isolation
as
the
four
in
the
small
ship
but
joe
painstakingly
played
the
buttons
of
the
control
board
the
ship
surged
and
turned
and
surged
forward
again
mike
at
the
communicator
said
they
say
slow
up
joe
joe
obeyed
but
he
was
tense
haney
and
the
chief
were
at
other
portholes
looking
out
the
chief
said
heavily
fellas
i
going
to
admit
i
never
felt
so
lonesome
in
my
life
i
glad
i
got
you
fellows
with
me
haney
admitted
guiltily
the
job
almost
over
said
joe
the
ship
own
hull
outside
the
ports
glowed
suddenly
in
a
from
the
platform
the
small
brief
surges
of
acceleration
which
sent
the
ship
on
produced
tremendous
emotional
effects
when
the
platform
was
only
one
mile
away
haney
switched
on
the
ship
searchlights
they
stabbed
through
emptiness
with
absolutely
no
sign
of
their
existence
until
they
touched
the
steel
hull
of
the
satellite
mike
said
sharply
slow
up
some
more
joe
he
obeyed
again
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
to
ram
the
platform
after
they
had
come
so
far
to
reach
it
they
drifted
slowly
slowly
slowly
toward
it
the
monstrous
pit
of
darkness
which
was
the
night
side
of
earth
seemed
almost
about
to
engulf
the
platform
they
were
a
few
hundred
feet
higher
than
the
great
metal
globe
and
the
blackness
was
behind
it
they
were
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
distance
diminished
a
thin
straight
line
seemed
to
grow
out
toward
them
there
was
a
small
object
at
its
end
it
reached
out
farther
than
was
at
all
plausible
nothing
so
slender
should
conceivably
reach
so
far
without
bending
of
its
own
weight
but
of
course
it
had
no
weight
here
it
was
a
plastic
flexible
hose
with
air
pressure
in
it
it
groped
for
the
spaceship
the
four
in
the
ship
held
their
breaths
there
was
a
loud
metallic
then
it
was
possible
to
feel
the
ship
being
pulled
toward
the
platform
by
the
magnetic
grapple
it
was
a
it
was
the
means
by
which
the
ship
would
be
docked
in
the
giant
lock
which
had
been
built
to
receive
it
as
they
drew
near
they
saw
the
joints
of
the
plating
of
the
platform
they
saw
rivets
there
was
the
huge
doorway
with
its
valves
swung
wide
their
searchlight
beam
glared
into
it
they
saw
the
metal
floor
and
the
bulging
plastic
sidewalls
restrained
by
nets
they
saw
the
inner
it
seemed
that
men
should
be
visible
to
welcome
them
there
were
none
the
airlock
swallowed
them
they
touched
against
something
solid
there
were
more
clankings
they
seemed
to
crunch
against
the
metal
floor
magnetic
then
in
solid
contact
with
the
substance
of
the
platform
they
heard
the
sounds
of
the
great
outer
doors
swinging
shut
they
were
within
the
artificial
satellite
of
earth
it
was
bright
in
the
lock
and
joe
stared
out
the
cabin
ports
at
the
quilted
sides
there
was
a
hissing
of
air
and
he
saw
a
swirling
mist
and
then
the
bulges
of
the
sidewall
sagged
the
air
pressure
gauge
was
spinning
up
toward
normal
air
pressure
joe
threw
the
ready
lever
of
the
steering
rockets
to
landed
there
was
silence
joe
looked
about
him
the
other
three
looked
queer
it
would
have
seemed
natural
for
them
to
rejoice
on
arriving
at
their
destination
but
somehow
they
did
feel
that
they
had
joe
said
wrily
it
seems
that
we
ought
to
weigh
something
now
got
here
so
we
feel
queer
that
we
do
shoes
mike
mike
peeled
off
the
slippers
from
their
place
on
the
cabin
wall
he
handed
them
out
and
opened
the
door
a
biting
chill
came
in
it
joe
slipped
on
the
with
their
elastic
bands
to
hold
them
he
stepped
out
the
door
he
did
land
he
floated
until
he
reached
the
sidewall
then
he
pulled
himself
down
by
the
netting
once
he
touched
the
floor
his
shoes
seemed
to
be
sticky
the
net
and
the
plastic
sidewalls
were
of
course
the
method
by
which
a
really
large
airlock
was
made
practical
when
this
ship
was
about
to
take
off
again
pumps
would
not
labor
for
hours
to
pump
the
air
out
the
sidewalls
would
inflate
and
closely
enclose
the
ship
hull
and
so
force
the
air
in
the
lock
back
into
the
ship
then
the
pumps
would
work
on
the
air
behind
the
inflated
walls
with
nets
to
help
them
draw
the
back
to
let
the
ship
go
free
the
lock
could
be
used
with
only
fifteen
minutes
for
pumping
instead
of
four
hours
the
door
in
the
back
of
the
lock
clanked
open
joe
tried
to
walk
toward
it
he
discovered
his
astounding
clumsiness
to
walk
in
shoes
in
weightlessness
requires
a
knack
when
joe
lifted
one
foot
and
tried
to
swing
the
other
forward
his
body
tried
to
pivot
when
he
lifted
his
right
foot
he
had
to
turn
his
left
slightly
inward
his
arms
tried
to
float
absurdly
upward
when
he
was
in
motion
and
essayed
to
pause
his
whole
body
tended
to
continue
forward
with
a
sedate
toppling
motion
that
brought
him
down
flat
on
his
face
he
had
to
put
one
foot
forward
to
check
himself
he
seemed
to
have
no
sense
of
balance
when
he
stood
still
his
stomach
queasy
because
of
weightlessness
he
found
himself
tilting
undignifiedly
forward
or
back
or
with
equal
unpredictability
sidewise
he
would
have
to
learn
an
entirely
new
method
of
walking
a
man
came
in
the
lock
and
joe
knew
who
it
was
sanford
the
senior
scientist
of
the
platform
crew
joe
had
seen
him
often
enough
on
the
television
screen
in
the
communications
room
at
the
shed
now
sanford
looked
but
his
eyes
were
bright
and
his
expression
sardonic
my
compliments
he
said
his
voice
tight
with
irony
for
a
splendidly
futile
job
well
done
you
got
your
cargo
invoice
joe
nodded
sanford
held
out
his
hand
joe
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
the
yellow
sheet
i
like
to
introduce
my
crew
said
joe
this
is
haney
and
chief
bender
and
mike
scandia
he
waved
his
hand
and
his
whole
body
wobbled
unexpectedly
we
know
each
other
said
sanford
sardonically
our
first
job
is
more
futility
to
get
the
guided
missiles
you
brought
us
into
the
launching
tubes
a
lot
of
good
they
do
a
huge
plate
in
the
roof
of
the
lock
but
it
was
not
up
or
down
or
in
any
particular
direction
withdrew
itself
a
man
floated
through
the
opening
and
landed
on
the
ship
hull
another
man
followed
him
chief
said
joe
and
haney
will
you
open
the
cargo
doors
the
two
swaying
figures
moved
to
obey
though
with
erratic
clumsiness
sanford
called
sharply
do
touch
the
hull
without
gloves
if
it
is
nearly
from
the
sunlight
it
be
below
zero
from
shadow
joe
realized
then
the
temperature
effects
the
skin
on
his
face
noticed
a
part
of
the
spaceship
hull
gave
off
heat
like
that
of
a
panel
heating
installation
another
part
imparted
a
chill
sanford
said
unpleasantly
you
want
to
report
your
heroism
eh
come
along
he
clanked
to
the
doorway
by
which
he
had
entered
joe
followed
and
mike
after
him
they
went
out
of
the
lock
sanford
suddenly
peeled
off
his
slippers
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
dived
casually
into
a
metal
tube
he
drifted
smoothly
away
along
the
lighted
bore
not
touching
the
sidewalls
he
moved
in
the
manner
of
a
dream
when
one
floats
with
infinite
ease
and
precision
in
any
direction
one
chooses
joe
and
mike
did
not
share
his
talent
joe
launched
himself
after
sanford
and
for
perhaps
or
feet
the
lighted
aluminum
sidewall
of
the
tube
sped
past
him
then
his
shoulder
rubbed
and
he
found
himself
skidding
to
an
undignified
stop
choking
the
bore
mike
thudded
into
him
i
have
got
the
hang
of
this
yet
said
joe
apologetically
he
untangled
himself
and
went
on
mike
followed
him
his
expression
that
of
pure
bliss
he
was
a
tiny
man
was
mike
but
he
had
the
longings
and
the
ambitions
of
half
a
dozen
men
in
his
small
body
and
he
had
known
frustration
he
could
prove
by
mathematics
that
space
exploration
could
be
carried
on
by
midgets
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
and
risk
of
the
same
job
done
by
men
he
was
of
course
quite
right
the
cabins
and
air
and
food
supplies
for
a
spaceship
crew
of
midgets
would
cost
and
weigh
a
fraction
of
similar
equipment
for
but
people
simply
were
interested
in
sending
midgets
out
into
space
but
mike
had
gotten
here
he
was
in
the
space
platform
there
were
men
who
would
joyfully
have
changed
places
with
him
inch
height
and
all
so
mike
was
blissful
the
tube
ended
and
joe
bounced
off
the
wall
that
faced
its
end
sanford
was
waiting
he
grinned
with
more
than
a
hint
of
spite
here
our
communications
room
he
said
now
you
can
talk
down
to
earth
it
be
relayed
now
but
in
half
an
hour
you
can
reach
the
shed
direct
he
floated
inside
joe
followed
cautiously
there
was
another
crew
member
on
duty
there
he
sat
before
a
group
of
radar
screens
with
thigh
grips
across
his
legs
to
hold
him
in
his
chair
he
turned
his
head
and
nodded
cheerfully
enough
here
snapped
sanford
joe
clambered
awkwardly
to
the
seat
the
senior
crew
member
pointed
out
he
made
his
way
to
it
by
handholds
on
the
walls
he
fumbled
into
the
chair
and
threw
over
the
curved
thigh
grips
that
would
hold
him
in
place
suddenly
he
was
oriented
he
had
seen
this
room
before
before
the
platform
was
launched
true
the
man
at
the
radar
screens
was
with
reference
to
himself
and
sanford
had
hooked
a
knee
negligently
around
the
arm
of
a
firmly
anchored
chair
with
his
body
at
right
angles
to
joe
own
but
at
least
joe
knew
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
to
do
go
ahead
and
report
said
sanford
sardonically
you
might
tell
them
that
you
heroically
destroyed
the
rockets
that
attacked
us
and
that
your
crew
behaved
splendidly
and
that
you
have
landed
in
the
space
platform
and
the
situation
is
well
in
hand
it
is
but
it
will
make
nice
headlines
joe
said
evenly
our
arrival
been
reported
no
said
sanford
grinning
obviously
the
radar
down
on
earth
shipboard
ones
on
this
hemisphere
of
course
have
reported
that
the
platform
still
exists
but
we
have
communicated
since
the
bombs
went
off
they
probably
think
we
had
so
many
punctures
that
we
lost
all
our
air
and
are
all
wiped
out
they
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
that
we
are
joe
threw
a
switch
frowning
this
was
right
sanford
was
the
senior
scientist
on
board
and
hence
in
command
because
he
was
to
direct
the
scientific
observations
the
platform
was
making
but
there
was
something
specifically
wrong
the
communicator
hummed
a
faint
voice
sounded
it
swelled
to
loudness
calling
space
platform
space
platform
calling
space
platform
joe
turned
down
the
volume
he
said
into
the
microphone
space
platform
calling
earth
joe
kenmore
reporting
we
have
made
contact
with
the
platform
and
completed
our
landing
our
cargo
is
now
being
unloaded
our
landing
rockets
had
to
be
expended
against
presumably
hostile
bombs
and
we
are
now
unable
to
return
to
earth
the
ship
and
the
platform
however
are
unharmed
i
am
now
waiting
for
orders
report
ends
he
turned
away
from
the
microphone
sanford
said
sharply
go
on
tell
them
what
a
hero
you
are
i
going
to
help
unload
my
ship
joe
said
shortly
you
report
what
you
please
get
back
at
that
transmitter
shouted
sanford
furiously
tell
you
a
hero
tell
you
wonderful
i
tell
how
useless
it
is
joe
saw
the
other
man
in
the
room
the
man
at
the
radar
screens
shake
his
head
he
got
up
and
fumbled
his
way
along
the
wall
to
the
door
sanford
shouted
after
him
angrily
joe
went
out
found
the
tunnel
and
floated
not
down
but
along
it
back
to
the
unloading
lock
wordlessly
he
set
to
work
to
get
the
cargo
out
of
the
cargo
hold
of
the
spaceship
handling
objects
in
weightlessness
which
on
earth
would
be
heavy
was
an
art
in
itself
two
men
could
move
tons
it
needed
only
one
man
to
start
a
massive
crate
in
motion
however
one
had
either
to
lift
or
push
an
object
in
the
exact
line
it
was
to
follow
to
thrust
hard
for
a
short
time
produced
exactly
the
same
effect
as
to
push
gently
for
a
longer
period
anything
floated
tranquilly
in
the
line
along
which
it
was
moved
the
man
who
had
to
stop
it
though
needed
to
use
exactly
as
much
energy
as
the
man
who
sent
it
floating
he
needed
to
check
the
floating
thing
in
exactly
the
same
line
if
one
tried
to
stop
a
massive
shipment
from
one
side
he
would
topple
into
it
and
he
and
the
crate
together
would
go
floundering
helplessly
over
each
other
the
chief
had
gone
off
to
help
maneuver
guided
missiles
into
launching
tubes
one
crew
member
remained
with
haney
unloading
things
that
would
have
had
to
be
handled
with
cranes
on
earth
joe
found
himself
needed
most
in
the
storage
chamber
a
crate
floated
from
the
ship
to
the
crewman
standing
head
downward
he
stopped
its
original
movement
braced
himself
and
sent
it
floating
to
joe
he
braced
himself
stopped
its
flight
and
very
slowly
to
move
fast
with
anything
heavy
in
his
hands
would
pull
his
feet
from
the
floor
set
it
on
a
stack
of
similar
objects
which
would
presently
be
fastened
in
place
everything
had
to
be
done
in
slow
motion
or
one
would
lose
his
footing
joe
worked
painstakingly
he
gradually
began
to
understand
the
process
but
the
muscles
of
his
stomach
ached
because
of
their
continuous
instinctive
cramp
due
to
the
sensation
of
unending
fall
mike
floated
through
the
hatchway
from
the
lock
he
twisted
about
as
he
floated
and
his
magnetized
soles
clanked
to
a
deft
contact
with
the
wall
he
said
calmly
that
guy
sanford
has
cracked
up
he
potty
if
this
were
jail
he
be
he
yelling
into
the
communicator
now
that
we
all
be
dead
in
a
matter
of
days
and
the
rocket
missiles
we
brought
up
wo
help
he
nasty
about
it
too
haney
called
from
the
cargo
space
of
the
ship
in
the
lock
all
empty
here
we
unloaded
there
were
sounds
as
he
closed
the
cargo
doors
haney
followed
by
the
chief
came
into
view
floating
as
mike
had
done
but
he
did
land
as
skillfully
he
touched
the
wall
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
bounced
away
and
tried
helplessly
to
swim
to
a
it
would
have
been
funny
except
that
joe
was
in
no
mood
for
humor
mike
whipped
off
his
belt
and
flipped
the
end
of
it
to
haney
he
caught
it
and
was
drawn
gently
to
the
wall
haney
shoes
clicked
to
a
hold
the
chief
landed
more
expertly
we
need
wings
here
he
said
ruefully
you
reported
joe
joe
nodded
he
turned
to
brent
the
crew
member
who
been
unloading
he
knew
him
too
from
their
video
conversations
sanford
does
act
oddly
he
said
uncomfortably
when
he
met
me
in
the
lock
he
said
our
coming
was
useless
he
talked
about
the
futility
of
everything
while
i
reported
he
sounds
like
he
sneers
at
every
possible
action
as
useless
most
likely
it
is
brent
said
mildly
here
anyhow
it
does
look
as
if
we
going
to
be
knocked
off
but
sanford
taking
it
badly
the
rest
of
us
have
let
him
act
as
he
pleased
because
it
did
seem
to
matter
it
probably
does
except
that
he
annoying
mike
said
truculently
we
wo
be
knocked
off
we
got
rockets
of
our
own
up
here
now
we
can
fight
back
if
there
another
attack
brent
shrugged
his
face
was
young
enough
but
deeply
lined
he
said
as
mildly
as
before
your
landing
rockets
set
off
four
bombs
on
the
way
from
earth
you
brought
us
six
more
rocket
missiles
how
many
bombs
can
we
knock
down
with
them
joe
blinked
it
was
a
shock
to
realize
the
facts
of
life
in
an
artificial
satellite
if
it
could
be
reached
by
bombs
from
earth
the
bombs
could
be
reached
by
guided
missiles
from
the
satellite
but
it
would
take
one
guided
missile
to
knock
down
one
bomb
with
luck
i
see
said
joe
slowly
we
can
handle
just
six
more
bombs
from
earth
six
in
the
next
month
agreed
brent
wrily
it
be
that
long
before
we
get
more
somebody
sent
up
four
bombs
today
suppose
they
send
eight
next
time
or
simply
one
a
day
for
a
week
mike
made
an
angry
noise
the
seventh
bomb
shot
at
us
knocks
us
out
we
sitting
ducks
here
too
brent
nodded
he
said
mildly
yes
the
platform
ca
be
defended
against
an
indefinite
number
of
bombs
from
earth
of
course
the
united
states
could
go
to
war
because
we
been
shot
at
but
would
that
do
us
any
good
we
be
shot
down
in
the
war
joe
said
distastefully
and
sanford
cracked
up
because
he
knows
going
to
be
killed
brent
said
earnestly
oh
no
he
a
good
scientist
but
he
always
had
a
brilliant
mind
poor
devil
he
never
failed
at
anything
in
all
his
life
until
now
now
he
failed
he
going
to
be
killed
and
he
ca
think
of
any
way
to
stop
it
his
brains
are
the
only
things
ever
believed
in
and
now
they
no
good
he
ca
accept
the
idea
that
he
stupid
so
he
has
to
believe
that
everything
else
is
it
a
necessity
for
him
have
you
known
people
who
had
to
think
everybody
else
was
stupid
to
keep
from
knowing
that
they
were
themselves
joe
nodded
he
waited
sanford
said
brent
earnestly
simply
ca
adjust
to
the
discovery
that
he
no
better
than
anybody
else
that
all
he
was
a
nice
guy
but
he
not
used
to
frustration
and
he
ca
take
it
therefore
he
scorns
everything
that
frustrates
him
and
everything
else
by
necessity
he
be
scornful
about
getting
killed
when
it
happens
but
waiting
for
it
is
becoming
intolerable
to
him
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
said
apologetically
i
the
crew
psychologist
that
why
i
speak
so
firmly
in
five
minutes
we
due
to
come
out
of
the
earth
shadow
into
sunshine
again
i
suggest
that
you
come
to
watch
it
good
to
look
at
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
he
led
the
way
and
the
others
followed
in
a
strange
procession
somehow
automatically
they
fell
into
single
file
and
they
moved
on
their
slippers
toward
a
passage
tube
in
one
wall
their
slipper
soles
clanked
and
clicked
in
an
erratic
rhythm
brent
walked
with
the
mincing
steps
necessary
for
movement
in
weightlessness
the
others
imitated
him
their
hands
no
longer
hung
naturally
by
their
sides
but
tended
to
make
extravagant
gestures
with
the
slightest
muscular
impulse
they
swayed
extraordinarily
as
they
walked
brent
was
a
slender
figure
and
joe
was
more
and
haney
was
taller
and
lean
the
burly
chief
and
the
inch
figure
of
mike
the
midget
followed
after
them
they
made
a
queer
procession
indeed
minutes
later
they
were
in
a
blister
on
the
skin
of
the
platform
there
were
quartz
glass
ports
in
the
sidewall
outside
the
glass
were
metal
shutters
brent
served
out
dense
goggles
almost
black
and
touched
the
buttons
that
opened
the
steel
port
coverings
they
looked
into
space
the
dimmer
stars
were
extinguished
by
the
goggles
they
wore
the
brighter
ones
seemed
faint
and
widely
spaced
beneath
their
feet
as
they
held
to
handrails
lay
the
featureless
darkness
of
earth
but
before
them
and
very
far
away
there
was
a
vast
dim
arch
of
deepest
red
it
was
sunlight
filtered
through
the
thickest
layers
of
earth
air
it
barely
outlined
the
curve
of
that
gigantic
globe
as
they
stared
it
grew
brighter
the
artificial
satellite
required
little
more
than
four
hours
for
one
revolution
about
its
primary
the
earth
to
those
aboard
it
the
earth
would
go
through
all
its
phases
in
no
longer
a
time
they
saw
now
the
thinnest
possible
crescent
of
the
new
earth
but
in
minutes
almost
in
seconds
the
deep
red
sunshine
brightened
to
gold
the
line
of
light
widened
to
a
narrow
ribbon
which
described
an
it
brightened
markedly
at
the
middle
it
remained
red
at
its
ends
but
in
the
very
center
it
glowed
with
splendid
flame
then
a
golden
ball
appeared
and
swam
up
and
detached
itself
from
the
earth
and
the
saw
the
spectacle
of
all
of
earth
surface
seemingly
being
born
of
the
night
as
if
before
their
eyes
seas
and
lands
unfolded
in
the
sunlight
they
watched
flecks
of
cloud
and
the
long
shadows
of
mountains
and
the
strangely
different
colorings
of
its
fields
and
forests
as
brent
had
told
them
it
was
good
to
watch
it
was
half
an
hour
later
when
they
gathered
in
the
kitchen
of
the
platform
the
man
who
had
been
loading
launching
tubes
now
briskly
worked
to
prepare
a
meal
on
the
extremely
unusual
of
a
human
outpost
in
interplanetary
space
the
food
smelled
good
but
joe
noticed
that
he
could
smell
growing
things
green
stuff
it
was
absurd
until
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
hydroponic
garden
here
plants
grew
in
it
under
sunlamps
which
were
turned
on
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
every
day
the
plants
purified
the
platform
air
and
of
course
provided
some
fresh
and
nourishing
food
for
the
crew
they
ate
the
food
was
served
in
plastic
bowls
with
elastic
thread
covers
through
which
they
could
see
and
choose
the
particular
morsels
they
fancied
next
the
threads
stretched
to
let
through
the
forks
they
ate
with
but
brent
used
a
rather
more
practical
pair
of
tongs
in
a
businesslike
manner
they
drank
coffee
from
cups
which
looked
very
much
like
ordinary
cups
on
earth
joe
remembered
suddenly
that
sally
holt
had
had
much
to
do
with
the
design
of
domestic
science
arrangements
here
he
regarded
his
cup
with
interest
it
stayed
in
its
saucer
because
of
magnets
in
both
plastic
articles
the
saucer
stayed
on
the
table
because
the
table
was
magnetic
too
and
the
coffee
did
not
float
out
to
in
a
hot
round
brownish
ball
because
there
was
a
transparent
cover
over
the
cup
when
one
put
his
lips
to
the
proper
edge
a
part
of
the
cover
yielded
as
the
cup
was
squeezed
the
far
side
of
the
cup
was
flexible
one
pressed
and
the
coffee
came
into
one
lips
without
the
spilling
of
a
drop
at
that
moment
joe
really
thought
of
sally
for
the
first
time
in
a
good
two
hours
she
been
anxious
that
living
in
the
platform
should
be
as
normal
and
as
possible
the
total
absence
of
weight
would
be
bad
enough
she
believed
it
needed
to
be
countered
as
a
psychological
factor
in
staying
sane
by
the
effect
of
chairs
and
food
and
not
too
exotic
systems
for
eating
joe
asked
brent
about
it
oh
yes
said
brent
mildly
it
likely
we
all
have
gone
off
the
deep
end
if
there
were
some
familiar
things
about
to
have
to
drink
from
a
cup
that
one
squeezes
is
tolerable
but
we
have
felt
hysterical
at
times
if
we
had
to
drink
everything
from
the
equivalent
of
baby
bottles
sally
holt
said
joe
is
a
friend
of
mine
she
helped
design
this
stuff
that
girl
has
every
ounce
of
brains
that
any
woman
can
be
trusted
with
brent
said
warmly
she
thought
of
things
that
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
as
a
psychologist
i
could
see
how
good
her
ideas
were
when
she
brought
them
up
but
as
a
male
i
never
have
dreamed
of
them
then
he
grinned
she
fell
down
on
just
one
point
so
did
everybody
else
nobody
happened
to
think
of
a
system
for
the
platform
it
came
into
joe
mind
that
was
hardly
a
subject
one
would
expect
to
be
discussing
in
interplanetary
space
but
the
platform
was
the
same
thing
as
a
spaceship
a
ship
could
jettison
refuse
and
leave
it
behind
or
store
it
during
a
voyage
and
dump
it
at
either
end
but
the
space
platform
would
never
land
it
could
roll
on
forever
and
if
it
heaved
out
its
refuse
from
airlocks
why
the
stuff
would
still
have
the
platform
orbital
speed
and
would
follow
it
tirelessly
around
the
earth
until
the
end
of
time
we
dry
and
store
it
now
said
brent
if
we
were
going
to
live
figure
out
some
way
to
turn
it
to
fertilizer
for
the
hydroponic
gardens
it
hardly
worth
while
as
things
are
even
then
though
the
problem
of
tin
cans
could
be
hopeless
the
chief
wiped
his
mouth
deliberately
he
had
helped
load
four
launching
tubes
and
he
had
been
brought
up
to
date
on
the
state
of
things
in
the
platform
he
growled
in
a
preliminary
fashion
and
said
joe
joe
looked
at
him
we
brought
up
six
guided
missiles
said
the
chief
dourly
we
have
warning
of
other
bombs
coming
up
we
can
send
these
missiles
out
to
intercept
six
of
they
can
get
close
enough
to
set
off
their
proximity
fuses
anyhow
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
joe
if
somebody
flings
seven
bombs
at
us
we
can
manage
six
maybe
but
we
do
with
the
one
that
left
over
have
you
any
ideas
asked
joe
the
chief
shook
his
head
brent
said
mildly
we
worked
on
that
here
in
the
platform
i
assure
you
and
as
sanford
puts
it
quite
soundly
about
the
only
thing
we
can
really
do
is
throw
our
empty
tin
cans
at
them
joe
nodded
then
he
tensed
brent
had
meant
it
as
a
rather
mirthless
joke
but
joe
was
astonished
at
what
his
own
brain
made
of
it
he
thought
it
over
then
he
said
why
not
it
ought
to
be
a
very
good
trick
brent
stared
at
him
incredulously
haney
looked
solemnly
at
him
the
chief
regarded
joe
thoughtfully
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
then
mike
shouted
gleefully
the
chief
blinked
and
a
moment
later
grunted
wrathful
unintelligible
syllables
of
mohawk
and
then
tried
to
pound
joe
on
the
back
and
because
of
his
want
of
weight
went
head
over
heels
into
the
air
between
the
six
walls
of
the
kitchen
haney
said
disgustedly
joe
there
are
times
when
a
guy
wants
to
murder
you
why
did
i
think
of
that
but
brent
was
looking
at
the
four
of
them
with
a
lively
helpless
curiosity
will
you
guys
let
me
in
on
this
they
told
him
joe
began
to
explain
it
carefully
but
the
chief
broke
in
with
a
barked
and
impatient
description
and
then
mike
interrupted
to
snap
a
correction
but
by
that
time
brent
expression
had
changed
with
astonishing
suddenness
i
see
i
see
he
said
excitedly
all
right
have
you
got
space
suits
in
your
ship
we
have
them
so
we
go
out
and
pelt
the
stars
with
garbage
i
think
we
better
get
at
it
right
now
too
in
under
two
hours
we
be
a
fine
target
for
more
bombs
and
it
would
be
good
to
start
ahead
of
time
mike
made
a
gesture
and
went
floating
out
of
the
kitchen
to
go
get
space
suits
from
the
ship
the
grin
on
his
small
face
threatened
to
cut
his
throat
joe
asked
sanford
in
command
he
like
this
idea
brent
hesitated
i
afraid
he
said
regretfully
he
wo
like
it
if
you
solve
a
problem
he
gave
up
it
will
tear
his
present
adjustment
to
bits
he
gone
psychotic
i
think
though
that
he
allow
it
to
be
tried
while
he
swears
at
us
for
fools
he
most
likely
to
react
that
way
if
you
suggest
it
then
agreed
joe
i
suggest
it
chief
the
chief
raised
a
large
brown
hand
i
got
the
program
joe
he
said
we
all
get
set
and
joe
went
floating
unhappily
through
to
the
control
room
he
heard
sanford
voice
sardonic
and
mocking
as
he
reached
the
communications
room
door
what
do
you
expect
sanford
was
saying
derisively
we
clay
pigeons
we
a
perfect
target
we
just
so
much
ammunition
now
you
say
you
may
send
us
more
in
three
weeks
instead
of
a
month
i
admire
your
persistence
but
it
really
no
use
this
is
all
a
very
stupid
business
he
felt
joe
presence
he
turned
and
then
sharply
struck
the
communicator
switch
with
the
heel
of
his
hand
the
image
on
the
television
screen
died
the
voice
cut
off
he
said
blandly
well
i
want
said
joe
to
take
a
party
out
on
the
outside
of
the
platform
i
came
to
ask
for
authority
sanford
looked
at
him
in
mocking
surprise
to
be
sure
it
seems
as
intelligent
as
anything
else
the
human
race
has
ever
done
he
observed
but
why
does
it
appeal
to
you
as
something
you
want
to
do
i
think
joe
told
him
that
we
can
make
a
defense
against
bombs
from
earth
with
our
empty
tin
cans
sanford
raised
his
eyebrows
if
you
happen
to
have
a
clover
with
you
he
said
in
fine
irony
i
told
they
good
too
his
eyes
were
bright
and
scornful
his
manner
was
feverishly
derisive
joe
would
have
done
well
to
let
it
go
at
that
but
he
was
nettled
we
set
off
the
last
bombs
he
said
doggedly
by
shooting
our
landing
rockets
at
them
they
did
collide
with
the
bombs
they
simply
touched
off
the
bombs
proximity
fuses
if
we
surround
the
platform
with
a
cluster
of
tin
cans
and
such
things
they
may
do
as
well
things
we
throw
away
wo
drop
to
earth
ultimately
they
actually
circle
us
like
satellites
themselves
but
if
we
can
get
enough
of
them
between
us
and
earth
any
bombs
that
come
up
will
have
their
proximity
fuses
detonated
by
the
floating
trash
we
throw
out
sanford
laughed
we
might
ask
for
ribbon
to
come
up
in
the
next
supply
ship
said
joe
we
could
have
masses
of
that
or
maybe
metallic
dust
floating
around
us
i
much
prefer
used
tin
cans
said
sanford
humorously
i
take
the
watch
here
and
let
everybody
go
out
with
you
by
all
means
we
must
defend
ourselves
forward
with
the
garbage
go
ahead
his
eyes
were
almost
hysterically
scornful
as
he
waited
for
joe
to
leave
joe
did
not
like
it
at
all
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
get
out
he
found
the
chief
with
a
net
bag
filled
with
emptied
tin
cans
haney
had
another
there
were
two
more
carried
by
members
of
the
crew
they
were
donning
their
space
suits
when
joe
came
upon
them
mike
was
grotesque
in
the
outfit
built
for
him
actually
the
only
difference
was
in
the
size
of
the
fabric
suit
and
the
length
of
the
arms
and
legs
he
could
carry
a
talkie
outfit
with
its
batteries
and
the
oxygen
tank
for
breathing
as
well
as
anybody
since
out
here
weight
did
not
count
at
all
there
were
plastic
ropes
resistant
to
extremes
of
temperature
joe
got
into
his
own
space
suit
it
was
no
such
space
craft
in
itself
as
the
fantastic
story
tellers
dreamed
of
it
was
not
much
more
than
an
altitude
suit
aluminized
to
withstand
the
blazing
heat
of
sunshine
in
emptiness
and
with
extravagantly
insulated
soles
to
the
magnetic
boots
in
theory
there
simply
is
no
temperature
in
space
in
practice
a
metal
hull
heats
up
in
sunshine
to
very
much
more
than
any
temperature
on
earth
in
shadow
too
a
metal
hull
will
drop
very
close
to
minus
degrees
centigrade
which
is
something
like
degrees
fahrenheit
below
zero
but
mainly
the
space
boots
were
insulated
against
the
almost
temperatures
of
sunshine
a
crewman
named
corey
moved
into
an
airlock
with
one
of
the
bags
of
empty
tin
cans
brent
watched
in
a
routine
fashion
through
a
glass
in
the
the
pumps
began
to
exhaust
the
air
from
the
airlock
corey
space
suit
inflated
visibly
presently
the
pump
stopped
corey
opened
the
outer
door
he
went
out
paying
plastic
rope
behind
him
an
instant
later
he
reappeared
and
removed
the
rope
he
made
his
line
fast
outside
he
closed
the
outer
air
surged
into
the
lock
and
haney
crowded
in
again
the
pumping
then
haney
went
out
and
was
anchored
to
the
platform
not
only
by
his
magnetic
boots
but
by
a
rope
fastened
to
a
brent
went
out
mike
joe
came
next
they
stood
on
the
hull
of
the
space
platform
waiting
in
the
incredible
harsh
sunshine
of
emptiness
the
bright
steel
plates
of
the
hull
swelled
and
curved
away
on
every
hand
there
were
myriads
of
stars
and
the
vast
round
bulk
of
earth
seemed
farther
away
to
a
man
in
a
space
suit
than
to
a
man
looking
out
a
port
where
shadows
cut
across
the
irregular
surface
there
was
utter
blackness
also
there
was
horrible
frigidity
elsewhere
it
was
blindingly
bright
the
men
were
specks
of
humanity
standing
on
a
shining
metal
hull
and
all
about
them
there
was
the
desolation
of
nothingness
but
joe
felt
strangely
proud
the
seventh
man
came
out
of
the
they
tied
their
plastic
ropes
together
and
spread
out
in
a
long
line
which
went
almost
around
the
platform
the
man
next
to
the
lock
was
anchored
to
a
steel
the
third
man
of
the
line
also
anchored
himself
the
fifth
the
seventh
they
were
a
straggling
line
of
figures
with
impossibly
elongated
shadows
held
together
by
ropes
they
were
peculiarly
like
a
party
of
weirdly
costumed
mountaineers
on
a
glacier
of
gleaming
silver
but
no
mountain
climbers
ever
had
a
background
of
ten
thousand
million
stars
peering
up
from
below
them
as
well
as
from
overhead
nor
did
any
ever
have
a
mottled
greenish
planet
rolling
by
miles
beneath
them
nor
a
blazing
sun
glaring
down
at
them
from
a
sky
such
as
this
in
particular
perhaps
no
other
explorers
ever
set
out
upon
an
expedition
whose
purpose
was
to
throw
tin
cans
and
dried
refuse
at
all
the
shining
cosmos
they
set
to
work
the
space
suits
were
inevitably
clumsy
it
was
not
easy
to
throw
hard
with
only
magnetism
to
hold
one
to
his
feet
it
was
actually
more
practical
to
throw
straight
up
with
an
underhand
gesture
but
even
that
would
send
the
tin
cans
an
enormous
distance
in
time
there
was
no
air
to
slow
them
the
tin
cans
twinkled
as
they
left
the
platform
steel
expanse
they
moved
away
at
a
speed
of
possibly
to
miles
an
hour
they
floated
off
in
all
possible
directions
they
would
never
reach
earth
of
course
they
shared
the
platform
orbital
speed
and
they
would
circle
the
earth
with
it
forever
but
when
they
were
thrown
away
their
orbits
were
displaced
a
little
each
can
thrown
downward
just
now
for
example
would
always
be
between
the
platform
and
the
earth
on
this
side
of
its
orbit
but
on
the
other
side
of
earth
it
would
be
above
the
platform
the
platform
in
fact
became
the
center
of
a
swarm
a
cluster
a
cloud
of
infinitesimal
objects
which
would
always
accompany
it
and
always
be
in
motion
with
regard
to
it
together
they
should
make
up
a
screen
no
proximity
fuse
bomb
could
pierce
without
exploding
joe
heard
clankings
transmitted
to
his
body
through
his
feet
what
that
he
demanded
sharply
it
sounds
like
the
airlock
voices
mingled
in
his
ears
the
other
allowed
everybody
to
speak
at
once
most
of
them
did
then
joe
heard
someone
laugh
it
was
sanford
voice
sandford
aluminized
figure
came
clanking
around
the
curve
of
the
small
metal
world
the
antenna
of
his
glittered
above
his
head
he
seemed
to
swagger
against
the
background
of
stars
brent
spoke
quickly
before
anyone
else
could
question
sanford
his
tone
was
mild
and
matter
of
fact
but
joe
somehow
knew
the
tension
behind
it
hello
sanford
you
came
out
was
it
wise
should
there
be
someone
inside
the
platform
sanford
laughed
again
it
was
very
wise
we
going
to
be
killed
as
you
fellows
know
perfectly
well
it
futile
to
try
to
avoid
it
so
very
sensibly
i
decided
to
spare
myself
the
nuisance
of
waiting
to
be
killed
i
came
out
there
was
silence
in
the
of
joe
space
suit
radio
he
heard
his
own
heart
beating
loudly
and
steadily
in
the
absolute
stillness
incidentally
said
sanford
with
almost
hysterical
amusement
i
fixed
it
so
that
none
of
us
can
get
back
in
it
would
be
useless
anyhow
everything
futility
so
i
put
an
end
to
our
troubles
for
good
locked
us
all
out
he
laughed
yet
again
and
joe
knew
that
in
sanford
madness
it
was
perfectly
possible
for
him
to
have
done
exactly
what
he
said
there
were
eight
human
beings
on
the
platform
all
were
now
outside
it
on
its
outer
skin
they
wore
space
suits
with
from
half
an
hour
to
an
hour
oxygen
supply
they
had
no
tools
with
which
to
break
back
into
the
satellite
and
no
help
could
possibly
reach
them
in
less
than
three
weeks
if
they
could
get
back
inside
the
platform
sanford
laughing
proudly
had
killed
them
all
there
was
a
babbling
of
angry
strained
tense
voices
in
headphones
then
the
chief
roared
for
silence
it
fell
save
for
sanford
quiet
hysterical
chuckling
joe
found
himself
rather
absurdly
thinking
that
sanford
was
not
actually
insane
except
as
any
man
may
be
who
believes
only
in
his
own
cleverness
sooner
or
later
it
is
bound
to
fail
him
on
earth
sanford
pride
in
his
own
intellect
had
been
useful
he
had
been
brilliant
because
he
accepted
every
problem
and
every
difficulty
as
a
challenge
but
with
the
platform
situation
seemingly
hopeless
he
been
starkly
unable
to
face
the
fact
that
he
was
clever
or
brilliant
or
intelligent
enough
if
joe
solution
to
the
proximity
fuse
bombs
had
been
offered
before
his
emotional
collapse
he
could
have
accepted
it
grandly
and
in
so
doing
have
made
it
his
own
but
it
was
too
late
for
that
now
he
given
up
and
worked
up
a
frantic
scorn
for
the
universe
he
could
not
cope
with
for
joe
trick
to
work
would
have
made
him
inferior
even
to
joe
in
his
own
view
and
he
could
have
that
even
to
die
with
the
prospect
that
others
would
survive
him
was
an
intolerable
prospect
he
had
to
be
smarter
than
anybody
else
so
he
chuckled
the
chief
roared
wrathfully
into
his
transmitter
quiet
this
crazy
fool
tried
to
commit
suicide
for
all
of
us
how
about
it
why
ca
we
get
back
in
how
many
locks
joe
found
himself
thinking
hard
he
could
be
angry
later
now
there
was
time
thirty
or
forty
minutes
of
breathing
no
tools
a
steel
hull
the
airlocks
were
naturally
arranged
for
the
greatest
possible
safety
under
normal
conditions
in
every
airlock
it
had
naturally
been
arranged
so
that
the
door
to
space
and
the
door
to
the
interior
could
not
be
open
at
the
same
time
that
was
to
save
lives
to
save
air
it
would
naturally
be
arranged
that
the
door
to
space
could
be
opened
until
the
lock
was
pumped
empty
that
in
itself
could
be
an
answer
joe
said
sharply
hold
it
chief
somebody
watch
sanford
all
we
got
to
do
is
find
which
lock
he
came
out
of
he
could
get
out
until
he
pumped
it
empty
and
that
unlocks
the
outer
door
but
sanford
laughed
once
more
he
sounded
like
someone
in
the
highest
of
high
good
humor
heroic
again
eh
but
i
took
a
compressed
air
bottle
in
the
lock
with
me
when
the
outer
door
was
open
i
opened
the
stopcock
and
shut
the
door
the
air
bottle
filled
the
lock
behind
me
naturally
i
fasten
the
door
after
i
came
out
one
must
be
intelligent
joe
heard
brent
muttering
yes
he
do
that
somebody
check
it
snapped
joe
make
sure
it
might
amuse
him
to
watch
us
die
while
he
knew
we
could
get
back
in
if
we
were
as
smart
as
he
is
there
were
clankings
on
the
hull
men
moved
unfastening
the
lines
which
held
them
to
the
hull
to
get
freedom
of
movement
but
not
breaking
the
links
which
bound
them
to
each
other
joe
saw
haney
go
grimly
back
to
the
task
of
throwing
away
the
stuff
that
they
had
brought
out
for
the
purpose
then
mike
voice
brittle
and
cagey
haney
quit
it
sanford
voice
again
horribly
amused
by
all
means
do
throw
away
our
garbage
we
may
need
it
a
voice
snapped
this
lock
fastened
another
voice
and
this
other
voices
with
increasing
desperation
verified
that
every
airlock
was
implacably
sealed
fast
by
the
presence
of
air
pressure
inside
the
lock
itself
time
was
passing
joe
had
never
noticed
before
the
minute
noises
of
the
air
pressure
apparatus
strapped
to
his
back
his
exhaled
breath
went
to
a
tiny
pump
that
forced
it
through
a
hygroscopic
filter
which
at
once
extracted
excess
moisture
and
removed
carbon
dioxide
the
same
pump
carefully
measured
a
volume
of
oxygen
equal
to
the
removed
and
added
it
to
the
air
it
released
the
pump
made
very
small
sounds
indeed
and
the
valves
were
almost
noiseless
but
joe
could
hear
their
clickings
something
burned
him
he
had
been
standing
perfectly
still
while
trying
to
concentrate
on
a
way
out
sunshine
had
shone
uninterruptedly
on
one
side
of
his
space
suit
for
as
long
as
five
minutes
despite
the
insulation
inside
that
was
too
long
he
turned
quickly
to
expose
another
part
of
himself
to
the
sunlight
he
knew
abstractedly
that
the
metal
underfoot
would
sear
bare
flesh
that
touched
it
a
few
yards
away
in
the
shadow
the
metal
of
the
hull
would
be
cold
enough
to
freeze
hydrogen
but
here
it
was
fiercely
hot
it
would
melt
solder
it
might
mike
was
fumbling
tin
cans
out
of
the
net
bag
from
which
haney
had
been
throwing
them
away
he
was
a
singular
small
figure
standing
on
shining
steel
looking
at
one
tin
can
after
another
and
impatiently
putting
them
aside
he
found
one
that
seemed
to
suit
him
it
was
a
large
can
he
knelt
with
it
pressing
a
part
of
it
to
the
hot
metal
of
the
satellite
hull
a
moment
later
he
was
ripping
it
apart
the
solder
had
softened
he
unrolled
a
sort
of
cylinder
then
bent
again
using
the
curved
inner
surface
to
concentrate
the
intolerable
sunshine
joe
caught
his
breath
at
the
implication
concentrated
sunshine
can
be
incredibly
hot
starting
with
unshielded
sunshine
practically
any
imaginable
temperature
is
possible
with
a
large
enough
mirror
mike
did
have
a
concave
mirror
he
had
only
a
cylindrical
one
he
could
reflect
light
to
a
point
but
only
to
a
line
mike
could
hope
to
do
more
than
double
or
triple
the
temperature
of
a
given
spot
but
considering
what
he
wore
on
his
back
joe
made
his
way
clumsily
to
the
spot
where
mike
now
gesticulated
to
haney
trying
to
convey
his
meaning
by
gestures
since
sanford
would
overhear
any
spoken
word
i
get
it
mike
said
joe
i
help
he
added
chief
you
watch
sanford
the
rest
of
you
try
to
flatten
out
some
tin
cans
or
find
some
with
flat
round
ends
he
reached
the
spot
where
mike
bent
over
the
plating
his
hand
moved
to
cast
a
shadow
where
the
light
had
played
i
need
more
reflectors
mike
said
brusquely
but
we
can
do
it
joe
beckoned
there
were
more
hurried
clankings
figures
gathered
about
the
platform
rolled
on
through
space
where
it
was
bright
it
was
very
very
bright
and
where
it
was
dark
it
was
blackness
off
in
emptiness
the
mass
of
earth
shone
hugely
rolling
past
innumerable
incurious
stars
looked
on
the
sun
flamed
malevolently
the
moon
floated
abstractedly
far
away
mike
was
bent
above
a
small
round
airlock
door
he
had
a
distorted
of
sheet
tin
between
his
hands
it
reflected
a
line
of
intensified
sunlight
to
the
edge
of
the
airlock
seal
haney
ripped
fiercely
at
other
tin
cans
joe
held
another
strip
of
polished
metal
it
focused
crudely
very
crudely
on
top
of
mike
line
of
reflected
sunshine
someone
else
held
the
end
of
a
tin
can
to
reflect
more
sunshine
someone
else
had
a
larger
disk
of
tin
they
stood
carefully
still
it
looked
completely
foolish
there
were
six
men
in
frozen
attitudes
trying
to
reflect
sunshine
down
to
a
single
spot
on
an
airlock
door
they
seemed
breathlessly
tense
they
ignored
the
glories
of
the
firmament
they
were
utterly
absorbed
in
trying
to
make
a
spot
of
unbearable
brightness
glow
more
brightly
still
mike
moved
his
hand
to
cast
a
shadow
the
steel
was
a
little
more
than
for
the
space
of
an
inch
it
would
not
melt
of
course
it
could
not
and
they
had
no
tools
to
bend
or
pierce
the
presumably
softened
metal
but
mike
said
fiercely
keep
it
hot
he
squirmed
his
space
suit
was
fabric
like
the
rest
but
it
had
been
cut
down
to
permit
him
to
use
it
it
was
bulkier
on
him
than
the
suits
of
the
others
he
shifted
his
shoulder
pack
the
brass
by
which
the
oxygen
tank
was
filled
he
jammed
a
ragged
fragment
of
tin
in
place
he
pressed
down
fiercely
a
blazing
jet
of
fierce
scintillating
streaking
sparks
leaped
up
from
the
spot
where
the
metal
glowed
brightly
a
hollow
in
the
metal
plate
appeared
the
metal
disintegrated
in
gushing
flecks
of
light
iron
in
pure
oxygen
happens
to
be
inflammable
iron
is
not
incombustible
at
all
powdered
steel
ground
fine
enough
will
burn
if
simply
exposed
to
air
really
fine
steel
wool
will
make
an
excellent
blaze
if
a
match
is
touched
to
it
iron
with
a
jet
of
oxygen
played
upon
it
explodes
to
steaming
sparks
technically
mike
had
used
the
perfectly
trick
of
an
oxygen
lance
to
pierce
the
airlock
door
let
the
air
out
of
the
lock
and
so
allow
the
outer
door
to
be
opened
there
was
a
rush
of
vapor
the
door
was
drilled
through
haney
picked
mike
up
bodily
joe
heaved
the
door
open
and
haney
climbed
into
it
practically
carrying
mike
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
joe
panted
plug
the
hole
from
the
inside
sit
on
it
if
you
have
to
and
slammed
the
door
shut
they
waited
sanford
voice
came
in
the
it
was
higher
in
pitch
than
it
had
been
you
fools
he
raged
it
useless
it
stupid
to
do
useless
things
it
stupid
to
do
anything
at
all
there
were
sudden
scuffling
clankings
joe
swung
about
the
chief
and
sanford
were
struggling
sanford
flailed
his
arms
about
trying
to
break
the
chief
faceplate
while
he
screamed
furious
things
about
futility
the
chief
got
exactly
the
hold
he
wanted
he
lifted
sanford
from
the
metal
deck
he
could
have
thrown
him
away
to
emptiness
then
but
he
did
not
he
set
sanford
in
as
if
upon
a
shelf
the
raging
man
hung
in
the
void
an
exact
above
the
platform
surface
the
chief
drew
back
and
left
him
there
sanford
could
writhe
there
for
a
century
before
the
platform
infinitesimal
gravity
brought
him
down
huh
said
the
chief
wrathfully
how
haney
and
mike
making
out
almost
on
the
instant
twenty
yards
away
a
tiny
airlock
door
thrust
out
from
the
surface
of
glittering
metal
and
helmet
and
antenna
appeared
you
guys
can
come
in
now
said
haney
voice
in
joe
headphones
it
all
okay
mike
pumping
out
the
other
locks
too
so
you
can
come
in
at
any
of
the
figures
clumped
loudly
to
airlock
doors
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
small
airlocks
in
various
parts
of
the
hull
besides
the
great
door
to
admit
supply
ships
the
chief
growled
and
moved
toward
sanford
now
raging
like
the
madman
his
helplessness
made
him
no
said
joe
shortly
he
fight
again
go
inside
that
an
order
chief
the
chief
grunted
and
obeyed
joe
went
to
the
nearest
airlock
and
entered
the
great
steel
hull
sanford
floated
in
emptiness
two
yards
from
the
space
platform
he
would
have
turned
into
a
derelict
he
did
not
move
farther
away
he
did
not
fall
toward
it
there
was
nobody
to
listen
to
him
he
cried
out
in
fury
because
other
men
were
smarter
than
he
was
other
men
had
solved
problems
he
could
not
solve
other
men
were
his
superiors
he
screamed
his
rage
presently
the
platform
revolved
slowly
beneath
him
it
was
turned
of
course
by
the
monster
gyros
which
in
turn
were
controlled
by
the
pilot
gyros
joe
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
had
repaired
when
saboteurs
smashed
them
the
platform
rotated
sedately
a
great
gap
appeared
in
it
the
door
of
the
supply
ship
lock
moved
until
sanford
floating
helplessly
was
opposite
its
mouth
a
rod
with
a
rounded
object
at
its
end
appeared
past
the
docked
supply
ship
it
reached
out
and
touched
sanford
helmet
it
was
the
magnetic
grapple
which
drew
space
ships
into
their
dock
it
drew
sanford
squirming
and
streaming
into
the
great
lock
the
outer
doors
closed
before
air
was
admitted
to
the
inside
sanford
went
suddenly
still
when
they
took
him
out
of
his
suit
he
was
apparently
unconscious
he
could
not
be
roused
freed
he
drew
his
knees
up
to
his
chin
in
the
position
in
which
primitive
peoples
bury
their
dead
he
seemed
to
sleep
brent
examined
him
carefully
catatonia
he
said
distastefully
he
spent
his
life
thinking
he
was
smarter
than
anybody
else
smarter
probably
than
all
the
universe
he
believed
it
he
could
face
the
fact
that
he
was
wrong
he
stay
conscious
and
not
know
it
so
he
blacked
out
he
refuses
to
be
anything
unless
he
can
be
smartest
we
have
to
do
artificial
feeding
and
all
that
until
we
can
get
him
down
to
earth
to
a
hospital
he
shrugged
we
better
report
this
down
to
earth
joe
said
by
the
way
better
not
describe
our
screen
of
tin
cans
on
radio
waves
not
even
microwaves
it
might
leak
and
we
want
to
see
if
it
works
just
hours
later
they
found
out
that
it
did
work
a
single
rocket
came
climbing
furiously
out
from
earth
it
came
from
the
and
they
could
not
see
where
it
was
launched
though
they
could
make
excellent
guesses
they
got
a
single
guided
missile
ready
to
crash
it
if
necessary
it
was
necessary
the
bomb
from
earth
detonated
miles
below
the
artificial
satellite
its
proximity
fuse
sending
out
small
waves
had
them
reflected
back
by
an
empty
sardine
can
thrown
away
from
the
platform
by
mike
scandia
hours
ago
the
sardine
can
had
been
traveling
in
its
own
private
orbit
ever
since
the
effect
of
muscles
had
not
been
to
send
it
back
to
earth
but
to
change
the
center
of
the
circular
orbit
in
which
it
floated
sometimes
it
floated
above
the
platform
that
was
on
one
side
of
earth
and
sometimes
below
it
it
was
about
miles
under
the
platform
when
it
reflected
urgent
squealing
radar
frequency
waves
to
a
complex
proximity
fuse
in
the
climbing
rocket
the
rocket
could
tell
the
difference
between
a
sardine
can
and
a
space
platform
it
exploded
with
a
blast
of
pure
brightness
like
that
of
the
sun
the
platform
went
on
its
monotonous
round
about
the
planet
from
which
it
had
risen
only
weeks
before
sanford
was
strapped
in
a
bunk
and
fed
through
a
tube
and
on
occasion
massaged
and
variously
tended
to
keep
him
alive
the
men
on
the
platform
worked
they
made
telephoto
maps
of
earth
they
took
highly
magnified
photographs
of
mars
pictures
that
could
not
possibly
be
made
with
such
distinctness
from
the
bottom
of
earth
turbulent
ocean
of
air
there
was
a
great
deal
of
official
business
to
be
done
weather
observations
of
the
form
and
distribution
of
cloud
masses
were
an
important
matter
the
platform
could
make
much
more
precise
measurements
of
the
solar
constant
than
could
be
obtained
below
the
flickering
radar
was
gathering
information
for
studies
of
the
frequency
and
size
of
meteoric
particles
outside
the
atmosphere
there
was
the
extremely
important
project
for
securing
and
sealing
in
really
good
vacua
in
various
electronic
devices
brought
up
by
joe
and
his
crew
in
the
supply
ship
but
sometimes
joe
managed
to
talk
to
sally
it
was
very
satisfying
to
see
her
on
the
television
screen
in
personal
conversation
their
talk
could
be
exactly
private
because
it
could
be
picked
up
elsewhere
it
probably
was
but
she
told
joe
how
she
felt
and
she
wanted
to
read
him
the
newspaper
stories
based
on
the
reports
brent
had
sent
down
brent
was
in
command
of
the
platform
now
that
sanford
lay
in
a
resolute
coma
in
his
bunk
but
joe
discouraged
such
waste
of
time
how
the
food
asked
sally
are
you
people
getting
any
fresh
vegetables
from
the
hydroponic
garden
they
were
and
joe
told
her
so
the
huge
chamber
in
which
glowed
for
a
measured
number
of
hours
in
each
produced
incredibly
luxuriant
vegetation
it
kept
the
air
of
the
ship
breathable
it
even
changed
the
smell
of
it
from
time
to
time
so
that
there
was
no
feeling
of
staleness
and
the
cooking
system
really
good
she
wanted
to
know
sally
was
partly
responsible
for
that
too
and
how
about
the
bunks
i
sleep
now
joe
admitted
that
had
been
difficult
it
was
possible
to
get
used
to
weightlessness
while
awake
one
would
slip
sometimes
and
find
himself
suddenly
tense
and
panicky
because
he
abruptly
noticed
all
over
again
that
he
was
falling
but
and
yet
again
sally
was
partly
responsible
the
bunks
were
designed
to
help
in
that
difficulty
each
bunk
had
an
inflatable
top
blanket
one
crawled
in
and
settled
down
and
turned
the
petcock
that
inflated
the
cover
then
it
held
one
quite
gently
but
reassuringly
in
place
it
was
possible
to
stir
and
to
turn
over
but
the
feeling
of
being
held
fast
was
very
comforting
with
a
little
care
about
what
one
thought
of
before
going
to
sleep
one
could
get
a
refreshing
eight
hours
rest
the
bunks
were
luxury
sally
said
the
date
and
time
a
secret
of
course
because
it
might
be
overheard
but
there
be
another
ship
up
before
too
long
bringing
landing
rockets
for
you
to
come
back
with
that
good
said
joe
it
would
feel
good
to
set
foot
on
solid
ground
again
he
looked
at
sally
and
said
eagerly
we
got
a
date
the
evening
i
get
back
we
got
a
date
she
said
nodding
but
it
could
very
well
be
a
definite
date
there
were
people
with
ideas
that
ran
counter
to
plans
for
joe
to
get
back
to
earth
and
a
date
with
sally
holt
the
space
platform
was
not
admired
uniformly
by
all
the
nations
of
earth
the
united
states
had
built
it
because
the
united
nations
could
and
one
of
the
attractions
of
the
idea
had
been
that
once
it
got
out
to
space
and
was
armed
peace
must
reign
upon
earth
because
it
could
smack
down
anybody
who
made
war
the
trouble
was
that
it
was
armed
well
enough
six
guided
missiles
could
defend
it
indefinitely
it
looked
as
helpless
as
isolated
berlin
did
before
the
first
airlift
proved
what
men
and
planes
could
do
in
the
way
of
transport
and
the
platform
enemies
did
intend
for
it
to
be
saved
by
a
rocketlift
they
would
try
to
smash
it
before
such
a
lift
could
get
started
a
week
after
joe
got
to
it
with
the
guided
missiles
three
rockets
attacked
they
went
up
from
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
one
blew
up
miles
below
the
platform
another
detonated
miles
away
for
safety
sake
the
third
was
crashed
at
the
cost
of
one
guided
missile
when
it
had
come
within
miles
the
screen
of
tin
cans
worked
but
it
was
thick
enough
the
occupants
of
the
platform
went
about
hunting
for
sheet
metal
that
could
be
spared
they
pulled
out
minor
partitions
here
and
there
and
went
out
on
the
surface
and
threw
away
thousands
of
small
glittering
scraps
of
metal
in
all
directions
two
weeks
later
there
was
another
attack
it
could
be
calculated
that
joe
could
have
carried
up
more
than
six
guided
missiles
there
might
be
as
few
as
two
of
them
left
so
eight
rockets
came
up
together
and
the
first
of
them
went
off
miles
from
the
platform
only
one
got
as
close
as
miles
no
guided
missiles
were
expended
in
defense
the
platform
enemies
tried
once
more
this
time
the
rockets
arched
up
above
the
platform
orbit
and
dived
on
the
satellite
from
above
there
were
two
of
them
they
went
off
at
and
miles
from
the
platform
joe
trash
screen
would
not
work
on
earth
but
in
space
it
was
an
adequate
defense
against
anything
equipped
with
proximity
fuses
it
could
be
assumed
that
in
a
nuts
bolts
rusty
nails
and
beer
bottle
caps
would
become
essential
military
equipment
three
days
after
this
last
attack
a
second
supply
ship
took
off
from
earth
lieutenant
commander
brown
was
a
passenger
its
start
was
just
like
the
one
joe
ship
had
made
pushpots
lifted
it
jatos
hurled
it
on
and
then
the
furious
flaming
rockets
drove
it
valiantly
out
toward
the
stars
joe
ship
had
been
moved
out
of
the
landing
lock
and
was
moored
against
the
platform
hull
the
second
ship
made
contact
in
two
hours
and
seventeen
minutes
from
it
arrived
with
its
own
landing
rockets
intact
and
it
brought
a
set
of
metal
tubes
for
joe
ship
to
get
back
to
earth
with
but
those
landing
rockets
and
lieutenant
commander
brown
constituted
all
its
payload
it
could
bring
up
anything
else
and
lieutenant
commander
brown
called
a
very
formal
meeting
in
the
huge
living
space
at
the
platform
center
he
stood
up
grandly
in
full
uniform
and
had
to
hook
his
feet
around
a
chair
leg
to
keep
from
floating
absurdly
in
this
detracted
slightly
from
the
dignity
of
his
stance
but
not
from
the
official
voice
with
which
he
read
two
documents
aloud
the
first
paper
detached
lieutenant
commander
brown
from
his
regular
naval
duties
and
assigned
him
pro
tem
to
service
with
the
space
exploration
project
the
second
was
an
order
directing
him
to
take
command
and
assume
direction
of
the
space
platform
having
read
his
orders
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
cordially
i
am
honored
to
serve
here
with
you
frankly
i
expect
to
learn
much
from
you
and
to
have
very
few
orders
to
give
i
expect
merely
to
exercise
such
authority
as
experience
at
sea
has
taught
me
is
necessary
for
a
tight
and
happy
ship
i
trust
this
will
be
one
he
beamed
nobody
was
impressed
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
simply
been
sent
up
to
acquire
experience
in
space
for
later
naval
use
and
that
he
been
placed
in
command
because
it
was
unthinkable
that
he
serve
under
anyone
without
official
rank
and
authority
and
he
quite
honestly
believed
that
his
coming
with
experience
in
command
was
a
blessing
to
the
platform
in
fact
there
was
no
danger
that
this
commander
of
the
platform
would
crack
up
under
stress
as
sanford
had
but
it
was
too
bad
that
he
had
brought
some
guided
missiles
with
him
joe
ship
had
brought
up
twenty
tons
of
cargo
and
twenty
tons
of
landing
rockets
the
second
ship
brought
up
twenty
tons
of
landing
rockets
for
joe
and
twenty
tons
of
landing
rockets
for
itself
that
was
all
the
second
trip
out
to
the
space
platform
was
a
rescue
mission
and
nothing
else
arithmetic
would
let
it
be
anything
else
and
there
could
be
any
idea
of
noble
and
staying
out
at
the
platform
either
because
only
four
ships
like
joe
had
been
begun
and
only
two
were
even
near
completion
joe
had
taken
off
the
instant
it
was
finished
the
second
had
done
the
same
the
second
pair
of
spaceships
would
be
ready
for
two
months
or
more
the
ships
that
could
be
used
had
to
be
used
so
only
hours
after
the
arrival
of
the
second
rocketship
at
the
platform
the
two
of
them
took
off
together
to
return
to
earth
joe
ship
left
the
airlock
first
sanford
was
loaded
in
the
cabin
of
the
other
ship
as
cargo
lieutenant
commander
brown
stayed
out
at
the
platform
to
replace
him
obviously
in
order
to
get
back
to
earth
they
headed
away
from
it
in
fleet
formation
they
pointed
their
rounded
noses
toward
the
milky
way
the
upward
course
was
an
application
of
the
principle
that
made
the
screen
of
tin
cans
and
oddments
remain
about
the
platform
each
of
those
small
objects
had
had
the
platform
own
velocity
and
orbit
thrown
away
from
it
the
centers
of
their
orbits
changed
in
theory
the
center
of
the
platform
orbit
was
the
center
of
earth
but
the
centers
of
the
orbits
of
the
objects
were
pushed
a
few
miles
twenty
fifty
a
hundred
away
from
the
center
of
earth
the
returning
space
ships
also
had
the
orbit
and
speed
of
the
platform
they
wanted
to
shift
the
centers
of
their
orbits
by
very
nearly
miles
so
that
at
one
point
they
would
just
barely
graze
atmosphere
lose
some
speed
to
it
and
then
bounce
out
to
empty
space
again
before
they
melted
cooled
off
they
make
another
grazing
bounce
after
eight
such
bounces
they
stay
in
the
air
and
the
stubby
fins
would
give
them
a
sort
of
gliding
angle
and
controllability
while
the
landing
rockets
would
let
them
down
to
solid
ground
or
so
it
was
hoped
meanwhile
they
headed
out
instead
of
in
toward
earth
they
went
out
on
their
only
using
the
liquid
fuel
that
had
not
been
needed
for
course
correction
on
the
way
out
at
miles
up
the
force
of
gravity
is
just
of
that
at
the
earth
surface
it
still
exists
it
is
merely
canceled
out
in
an
orbit
the
ships
could
move
outward
at
less
cost
in
fuel
than
they
could
move
in
so
they
went
out
and
out
on
parallel
courses
and
the
platform
dwindled
behind
them
night
flowed
below
until
the
hull
of
the
artificial
satellite
shone
brightly
against
a
background
of
seeming
sheer
nothingness
the
twilight
zone
of
earth
shadow
reached
the
platform
it
glowed
redly
glowed
crimson
glowed
the
deepest
possible
color
that
could
be
seen
and
winked
out
the
ships
climbed
on
using
their
tiny
steering
rockets
nothing
happened
the
ships
drew
away
from
each
other
for
safety
they
were
then
miles
apart
one
glowed
red
and
vanished
in
the
shadow
of
the
earth
the
other
was
extinguished
in
the
same
way
then
they
went
hurtling
through
the
blackness
of
the
night
side
of
earth
microwaves
from
the
ground
played
upon
them
radar
used
by
friend
and
foe
alike
and
the
friendly
radar
guided
communicator
waves
to
them
with
comforting
assurance
that
their
joint
course
and
height
and
speed
were
exactly
the
calculated
optimum
but
they
could
not
be
seen
at
all
when
they
appeared
again
they
were
still
farther
out
from
earth
than
the
platform
orbit
but
no
farther
from
each
other
and
they
were
descending
the
centers
of
their
orbits
had
been
displaced
very
very
far
indeed
going
out
naturally
the
ships
had
lost
angular
speed
as
they
gained
in
height
descending
they
gained
in
angular
velocity
as
they
lost
height
they
were
not
quite
miles
apart
as
they
sped
with
increasing
headlong
speed
and
rushed
toward
the
edge
of
the
world
disk
when
they
were
only
miles
high
the
earth
surface
under
them
moved
much
faster
than
it
had
on
the
way
up
when
they
were
only
miles
high
the
seas
and
continents
seemed
to
flow
past
like
a
rushing
river
at
miles
mountains
and
plains
were
just
distinguishable
as
they
raced
past
underneath
at
miles
there
was
merely
a
churning
hurtling
surface
on
which
one
could
not
focus
one
eyes
because
of
the
speed
of
its
movement
they
missed
the
solid
surface
of
earth
by
barely
miles
they
were
moving
at
a
completely
impossible
speed
the
energy
of
their
position
miles
high
had
been
transformed
into
kinetic
energy
of
motion
and
at
miles
there
is
something
very
close
to
a
vacuum
compared
to
but
compared
to
true
emptiness
and
at
the
speed
of
meteors
the
thin
air
had
a
violent
effect
a
thin
humming
sound
began
it
grew
louder
the
substance
of
the
ship
was
responding
to
the
impact
of
the
thin
air
upon
it
the
sound
rose
to
a
roar
to
a
bellow
to
a
thunderous
tumult
the
ship
quivered
and
trembled
it
shook
a
violent
vibration
set
up
and
grew
more
and
more
savage
the
whole
ship
shook
with
a
dreadful
persistence
each
vibration
more
monstrous
more
straining
more
ominous
than
before
the
four
in
the
space
ship
cabin
knew
torture
weight
returned
to
them
weight
more
violent
than
the
six
gravities
they
had
known
for
a
bare
fourteen
seconds
at
but
that
at
least
had
been
smoothly
applied
this
was
deceleration
at
a
higher
figure
yet
and
accompanied
by
the
shaking
of
bodies
which
weighed
seven
times
as
much
as
ever
before
and
bodies
too
which
for
weeks
past
had
been
subject
to
no
weight
at
all
they
endured
nothing
at
all
could
be
done
at
so
many
miles
per
second
no
possible
human
action
could
be
determined
upon
and
attempted
in
time
to
have
any
effect
upon
the
course
of
the
ship
joe
could
see
out
a
quartzite
port
the
ground
miles
below
was
merely
a
blur
there
was
a
black
sky
overhead
which
did
not
seem
to
stir
but
rushed
at
speed
below
him
and
his
body
weighed
more
than
half
a
ton
and
the
ship
made
the
sound
of
innumerable
thunders
and
shook
and
shook
and
shook
and
then
when
it
seemed
that
it
must
fly
utterly
to
pieces
the
thunder
diminished
gradually
to
a
bellow
and
the
bellow
to
a
roar
and
the
roaring
and
the
unthinkable
weight
oppressing
him
grew
less
the
earth
was
farther
away
and
moving
farther
still
they
were
miles
high
they
were
miles
high
there
was
no
longer
any
sound
at
all
except
their
gaspings
for
breath
their
muscles
had
refused
to
lift
their
chests
at
all
during
the
most
brutal
of
the
deceleration
period
presently
joe
croaked
a
question
he
looked
at
the
indicators
they
were
very
very
high
he
found
that
he
was
bruised
where
he
had
strapped
himself
in
the
places
where
each
strap
had
held
his
heavy
body
against
the
ship
vibrations
were
deeply
the
chief
said
thickly
joe
somehow
i
do
think
this
is
going
to
work
when
do
we
hit
again
three
hours
plus
or
minus
something
said
joe
hear
from
the
ground
mike
said
in
a
cracked
voice
radar
reports
we
went
a
little
bit
too
low
they
think
we
were
tilted
up
far
enough
we
did
bounce
as
soon
as
we
should
joe
unstrapped
himself
how
about
the
other
ship
it
did
better
than
we
did
said
mike
it
a
good
miles
ahead
down
at
the
shed
they
recalculating
for
us
we
have
to
land
with
six
grazes
instead
of
eight
we
lost
too
much
speed
joe
went
staggering
again
weightless
to
look
out
a
port
for
the
other
ship
he
should
have
known
better
one
does
not
spot
an
space
ship
with
the
naked
eye
when
it
is
miles
away
but
he
saw
something
though
for
seconds
he
did
know
what
it
was
now
the
little
ship
was
miles
high
and
still
rising
joe
was
dazed
and
battered
by
the
vibration
of
the
ship
in
the
graze
just
past
the
sister
space
ship
had
lost
speed
so
fast
it
would
be
traveling
faster
it
would
be
leaving
him
farther
behind
every
second
it
was
rising
more
sharply
it
would
rise
higher
joe
stared
numbly
out
of
a
port
thinking
confusedly
that
his
hull
would
be
dull
red
on
its
outer
surface
though
the
heating
had
been
so
fast
that
the
inner
surfaces
of
the
plating
might
still
be
cold
he
saw
the
vast
area
which
was
the
curve
of
the
edge
of
the
world
he
saw
the
sunlight
upon
clouds
below
and
glimpses
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
itself
and
he
saw
something
rising
out
of
the
mists
at
the
far
horizon
it
was
a
thread
of
white
vapor
the
other
rocketship
was
a
speck
a
mote
invisible
because
of
its
size
and
distance
this
thread
of
vapor
was
already
miles
long
and
it
expanded
to
a
column
of
whiteness
half
a
mile
across
before
it
seemed
to
dissipate
it
rose
and
rose
as
if
following
something
which
sped
upward
it
was
a
rocket
trail
the
violence
of
its
writhings
proved
the
fury
with
which
the
rocket
climbed
it
was
on
its
way
to
meet
the
other
space
ship
it
did
joe
saw
the
thread
of
vapor
extend
and
grow
until
it
was
higher
than
he
was
he
never
saw
the
other
ship
which
was
too
small
but
he
saw
the
burst
of
flame
bright
as
the
sun
itself
which
was
the
explosion
of
a
proximity
fuse
bomb
he
knew
then
that
nothing
but
incandescent
radioactive
gas
remained
of
the
other
ship
and
its
crew
then
he
saw
the
trail
of
the
second
rocket
it
was
rising
to
meet
him
the
four
of
them
watched
through
the
ports
as
the
thread
of
vapor
sped
upward
they
hated
the
rocket
and
the
people
who
had
built
it
joe
said
between
his
teeth
we
could
spend
our
and
make
it
chase
us
but
it
have
fuel
for
that
the
chief
muttered
in
mohawk
the
words
sounded
as
if
they
ought
to
have
blue
fire
at
their
edges
and
smell
of
sulphur
mike
the
midget
said
crackling
things
in
his
small
voice
haney
stared
his
eyes
burning
their
ship
was
a
little
over
miles
up
now
the
rocket
was
or
better
the
rendezvous
would
be
probably
miles
ahead
and
correspondingly
higher
the
rocket
was
accelerating
furiously
it
had
farther
to
travel
but
its
rate
of
climb
was
already
enormous
and
it
increased
every
second
the
ship
could
swing
to
right
or
left
on
steering
rockets
but
the
war
rocket
could
swerve
also
it
was
controlled
from
the
ground
it
did
not
need
to
crash
the
small
ship
from
space
within
a
limited
number
of
miles
the
blast
of
its
atomic
warhead
would
vaporize
any
substance
that
could
exist
and
of
course
the
ship
could
not
turn
back
even
the
expenditure
of
all
its
could
not
bring
twenty
tons
of
ship
to
a
halt
they
could
speed
it
up
so
it
would
pass
the
calculated
meeting
place
ahead
of
the
war
rocket
but
the
bomb
would
simply
follow
in
a
stern
chase
in
any
case
the
ship
could
not
stop
but
neither
could
the
rocket
joe
never
knew
how
he
saw
the
significance
of
that
fact
on
land
or
sea
of
course
an
automobile
or
a
ship
moves
in
the
direction
in
which
it
is
pointed
even
an
airplane
needs
to
make
only
minor
corrections
for
air
currents
which
affect
it
but
an
object
in
space
moves
on
a
course
which
is
the
sum
of
all
its
previous
speeds
and
courses
joe
ship
was
moving
eastward
above
the
earth
at
so
many
miles
per
second
if
he
drove
north
at
a
right
angle
to
his
present
course
the
ship
would
not
cease
to
move
to
the
east
it
would
simply
move
northward
in
addition
to
moving
east
if
the
rocket
from
earth
turned
north
or
east
it
would
continue
to
move
up
and
merely
add
the
other
motion
to
its
vertical
rise
joe
stared
at
the
uncoiling
thread
of
vapor
which
was
the
murder
rocket
trail
he
hated
it
so
fiercely
that
he
wanted
to
escape
it
even
at
the
cost
of
destruction
merely
to
foil
its
makers
at
one
moment
he
was
hardly
aware
of
anything
but
his
own
fury
and
the
frantic
desire
to
frustrate
the
rocket
at
any
cost
the
next
instant
somehow
he
was
not
angry
at
all
because
somehow
his
brain
had
dredged
up
the
fact
that
the
war
rocket
could
no
more
turn
back
than
he
could
and
he
saw
its
meaning
mike
he
snapped
sharply
get
set
report
what
we
do
everybody
set
for
acceleration
steering
rockets
ready
chief
get
set
to
help
haney
i
do
know
whether
we
get
out
of
this
alive
but
we
better
get
into
our
space
suits
then
he
literally
dived
back
to
his
acceleration
chair
and
strapped
in
in
feverish
haste
the
ship
was
then
a
quarter
of
the
way
to
the
meeting
place
and
the
rocket
had
very
much
farther
to
go
but
it
was
rising
faster
the
ship
gyros
whined
and
squealed
as
joe
jammed
on
their
controls
the
little
ship
spun
in
emptiness
its
bow
turned
and
pointed
down
the
steering
rockets
made
their
roarings
joe
found
himself
panting
the
rocket
rising
faster
than
we
are
it
been
gaining
altitude
maybe
two
minutes
it
lighter
than
when
it
started
but
it
ca
stop
less
than
a
minute
anyhow
so
we
duck
under
it
he
did
not
make
computations
there
was
no
time
the
war
rocket
might
have
started
at
four
or
five
gravities
acceleration
but
it
would
speed
up
as
its
fuel
burned
it
might
be
accelerating
at
fifteen
gravities
now
and
have
an
attained
velocity
of
four
miles
a
second
and
still
increasing
if
the
little
ship
ducked
under
it
it
could
not
kill
that
in
time
to
follow
in
a
stern
chase
haney
panted
joe
watch
out
the
port
are
we
going
to
make
it
haney
crawled
forward
joe
had
forgotten
the
radar
because
he
seen
the
rocket
with
his
own
eyes
it
seemed
to
need
eyes
to
watch
it
mike
spoke
curtly
into
the
microphone
broadcasting
to
ground
he
was
reporting
each
action
and
order
as
it
took
place
and
was
given
there
was
no
time
to
explain
anything
but
mike
thought
of
the
radar
he
watched
it
it
showed
the
vast
curve
of
earth
surface
miles
down
it
showed
a
moving
pip
much
too
much
nearer
which
was
the
war
rocket
mike
made
a
dot
on
the
screen
with
a
grease
pencil
where
the
pip
showed
it
moved
he
made
another
dot
the
pip
continued
to
move
he
made
other
dots
they
formed
a
curving
line
curved
because
the
rocket
was
accelerating
which
moved
inexorably
toward
the
center
of
the
radar
screen
the
curve
would
cut
the
screen
exact
center
that
meant
collision
too
close
joe
said
mike
shrilly
we
may
miss
it
but
not
enough
then
hold
fast
yelled
joe
landing
rockets
firing
three
two
one
the
bellowing
of
the
smote
their
ears
weight
seized
upon
them
three
gravities
of
acceleration
toward
the
rushing
flood
of
clouds
and
solidity
which
was
the
earth
the
ship
plunged
downward
with
all
its
power
it
was
intolerable
and
ten
times
worse
because
they
had
been
weightless
so
long
and
were
still
shaken
and
sore
and
bruised
from
the
only
minutes
back
mike
took
acceleration
better
than
the
others
but
his
voice
was
thin
when
he
gasped
looks
like
this
does
it
joe
seconds
later
he
gasped
again
right
the
rocket
above
us
and
still
going
away
the
gyros
squealed
again
the
ship
plunged
into
vapor
which
was
the
trail
of
the
enemy
rocket
for
an
instant
the
flowing
confusion
which
was
earth
was
blotted
out
then
it
was
visible
again
the
ship
was
plunging
downward
but
its
sidewise
speed
was
undiminished
and
much
greater
than
its
rate
of
fall
mike
panted
joe
get
the
news
out
what
we
did
and
why
i
going
to
turn
the
ship
head
back
on
our
course
we
ca
slow
enough
but
i
rather
crash
on
earth
than
let
them
blast
us
the
ship
turned
again
it
pointed
back
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come
with
the
brutal
sternward
pressure
produced
by
the
it
felt
as
if
it
were
speeding
madly
back
where
it
had
come
from
it
was
the
sensation
they
felt
when
the
ship
took
off
from
earth
so
long
before
but
then
the
cloud
masses
and
the
earth
beneath
had
flowed
toward
the
ship
and
under
it
now
they
flowed
away
the
appearance
was
that
of
an
unthinkably
swift
wake
left
behind
by
a
ship
at
sea
the
earth
surface
fled
away
and
fled
away
from
them
crazy
this
joe
muttered
thickly
if
the
ship
were
lighter
or
we
had
more
power
we
could
land
i
sorry
but
i
rather
haney
turned
his
head
from
where
he
clung
near
the
his
features
changed
slowly
as
he
talked
because
of
blood
engorging
his
lips
and
bloating
his
cheeks
after
one
instant
he
closed
his
eyes
fiercely
they
felt
as
if
they
would
pop
out
of
his
head
he
gasped
yes
get
down
to
a
chance
not
good
but
a
chance
ejection
seats
with
space
suits
might
make
it
he
began
to
let
himself
back
toward
his
acceleration
chair
he
could
not
possibly
have
climbed
forward
it
was
a
horrible
task
to
let
himself
down
with
triple
his
normal
weight
pulling
at
him
and
after
the
beating
taken
a
little
while
ago
sweat
stood
out
on
his
skin
as
he
lowered
himself
sternward
once
his
grip
on
a
slipped
and
he
had
to
sustain
the
drag
of
nearly
six
hundred
pounds
by
a
single
hand
and
arm
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
to
fall
at
three
gravities
the
landing
rockets
roared
and
roared
and
joe
tilted
the
bow
down
a
little
farther
so
that
the
streaming
flood
of
clouds
drew
nearer
haney
got
to
his
acceleration
chair
he
let
himself
into
it
and
his
eyes
closed
mike
sharp
voice
barked
what
the
chance
haney
haney
mouth
opened
and
closed
and
opened
again
rocket
flames
he
gasped
pushed
back
wind
splash
on
hull
may
melt
lighten
weight
hundred
to
one
against
the
odds
were
worse
than
that
the
ship
could
land
because
its
momentum
was
too
great
for
the
landing
rockets
to
cancel
out
if
it
had
weighed
five
tons
instead
of
twenty
landing
might
have
been
possible
haney
was
saying
that
if
the
ship
were
to
be
lowered
into
air
while
rushing
irresistibly
sternward
despite
its
rockets
that
the
rocket
flames
might
be
splashed
out
by
the
wind
instead
of
streaking
astern
in
a
shape
they
might
be
pushed
out
like
a
rocket
blast
when
it
hits
the
earth
in
a
guided
missile
such
a
blast
spreads
out
flat
in
all
directions
here
the
rocket
flames
might
be
spread
by
wind
until
they
played
upon
the
hull
of
the
ship
if
they
did
they
might
melt
it
as
they
melted
their
own
steel
cases
in
firing
and
or
more
of
the
hull
might
be
torn
loose
from
the
cabin
bow
section
so
much
was
unlikely
but
it
was
possible
the
impossible
odds
were
that
the
four
could
survive
even
if
the
cabin
were
detached
they
were
decelerating
at
three
gravities
now
if
part
of
the
ship
burned
or
melted
or
was
torn
away
the
rocket
thrust
might
speed
the
cabin
up
to
almost
any
figure
and
there
is
a
limit
to
the
number
of
gravities
a
man
can
take
even
in
an
acceleration
chair
nevertheless
that
was
what
haney
proposed
they
were
due
to
be
killed
anyhow
joe
tried
it
he
dived
into
atmosphere
at
miles
altitude
a
thin
wailing
seemed
to
develop
without
reason
at
miles
the
ship
had
lost
more
than
two
miles
per
second
of
its
speed
since
the
were
ignited
and
there
was
a
shuddering
in
all
its
fabric
though
because
of
the
loss
of
speed
it
was
not
as
bad
as
the
at
it
began
to
shake
and
tremble
at
miles
high
there
was
as
horrible
a
vibration
and
as
deadly
a
deceleration
as
at
the
at
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
hull
temperature
indicators
showed
the
hind
part
of
the
hull
at
red
heat
the
ship
happened
to
be
traveling
backward
at
several
times
the
speed
of
sound
and
air
could
not
move
away
from
before
it
it
was
compressed
to
white
heat
at
the
entering
surface
and
the
metal
plating
went
to
bright
red
heat
at
that
point
but
the
hull
just
aft
of
the
rocket
mouths
was
hotter
still
there
the
splashing
rocket
flames
bathed
it
in
intolerable
incandescence
hull
plates
braces
and
beams
glared
white
the
tip
of
the
tail
caved
in
the
ship
empty
cargo
space
was
instantly
filled
with
air
at
intolerable
pressure
and
heat
the
hull
exploded
outward
where
the
rocket
flames
played
there
was
a
monstrous
incredible
jerking
of
the
cabin
that
remained
that
fraction
of
the
ship
received
the
full
force
of
the
rocket
thrust
they
could
decelerate
it
at
a
rate
of
fifteen
gravities
or
more
they
did
joe
lost
consciousness
as
instantly
and
as
peacefully
as
if
he
had
been
hit
on
the
jaw
an
unknown
but
brief
time
later
he
found
himself
listening
with
a
peculiar
astonishment
the
rockets
had
burned
out
they
had
lasted
only
seconds
after
the
separation
of
the
ship
into
two
fragments
radars
on
the
ground
are
authority
for
this
those
few
seconds
were
extremely
important
the
cabin
lost
an
additional
per
second
of
velocity
which
was
enough
to
make
the
difference
between
the
cabin
heating
up
too
and
the
cabin
being
not
quite
destroyed
the
cabin
remnant
was
heavy
of
course
but
it
was
an
irregular
object
some
twenty
feet
across
it
was
below
orbital
velocity
and
slowed
it
even
so
it
traveled
miles
to
the
east
in
falling
the
last
miles
to
earth
it
hit
a
hillside
and
dug
itself
a
crater
in
the
ground
but
there
was
nobody
in
it
then
a
little
over
a
month
before
it
had
seemed
to
joe
that
ejection
seats
were
the
most
useless
of
all
possible
pieces
of
equipment
to
have
in
a
space
ship
he
been
as
much
mistaken
as
anybody
could
be
with
an
ejection
seat
a
jet
pilot
can
be
shot
out
of
a
plane
traveling
over
mach
one
and
live
to
tell
about
it
this
crumpling
cabin
fell
fast
but
joe
stuffed
mike
in
an
ejection
seat
and
shot
him
out
he
and
the
chief
dragged
haney
to
a
seat
and
then
the
chief
shoved
joe
off
and
the
four
of
them
one
by
one
were
flung
out
into
a
screaming
stream
of
air
but
the
did
not
burst
they
nearly
broke
the
necks
of
their
passengers
but
they
let
them
down
almost
gently
and
it
was
quite
preposterous
but
all
four
landed
intact
mike
being
lightest
and
first
to
be
ejected
came
down
by
himself
in
a
fury
because
he
been
treated
with
special
favor
the
chief
and
joe
landed
almost
together
after
a
long
time
joe
staggered
out
of
his
space
suit
and
harness
and
tried
to
help
the
chief
and
they
held
each
other
up
as
they
stumbled
off
together
in
search
of
haney
when
they
found
him
he
was
sleeping
heavily
exhausted
in
a
canebrake
he
had
even
bothered
to
disengage
his
parachute
harness
or
take
off
his
suit
a
good
deal
of
that
landing
remained
confused
in
joe
mind
while
it
was
going
on
he
was
much
too
busy
to
be
absorbing
impressions
when
he
landed
he
was
as
completely
exhausted
as
anybody
wants
to
be
it
was
only
during
the
next
day
that
he
even
tried
to
sort
out
his
recollections
then
he
woke
up
suddenly
with
a
muffled
roaring
going
on
all
about
him
he
blinked
his
eyes
open
and
listened
presently
he
realized
what
the
noise
was
and
wondered
that
he
had
realized
before
it
was
the
roaring
of
the
motors
of
a
plane
he
knew
without
remembering
the
details
at
the
moment
that
he
and
the
other
three
were
on
a
plane
bound
across
the
pacific
for
america
he
was
in
a
bunk
and
he
felt
extraordinarily
heavy
he
tried
to
move
and
it
was
an
enormous
effort
to
move
his
arm
he
struggled
to
turn
over
and
found
straps
holding
his
body
down
he
fumbled
at
them
they
had
readily
releasable
clasps
and
he
loosened
them
easily
after
a
bit
he
struggled
to
sit
upright
he
was
horribly
heavy
or
horribly
weak
he
could
tell
which
and
each
separate
muscle
in
his
whole
body
ached
twinges
of
pain
accompanied
every
movement
he
sat
up
swaying
a
little
with
the
slow
movements
of
the
plane
and
gradually
things
came
back
the
landing
in
the
they
come
down
somewhere
on
the
west
coast
of
india
not
too
far
from
the
sea
he
remembered
crashing
into
the
edge
of
a
thin
jungle
and
finding
the
chief
and
the
two
of
them
searching
out
haney
and
stumbling
to
open
ground
after
laying
out
a
signal
for
air
searchers
they
went
off
into
slumber
while
they
waited
he
remembered
that
there
been
a
patrol
of
american
destroyers
in
the
arabian
sea
as
everywhere
under
the
orbit
of
the
platform
their
radar
had
reported
the
destruction
of
one
space
ship
and
the
frantic
diving
of
the
other
its
division
into
two
parts
and
then
the
tiny
objects
which
flew
out
from
the
smaller
cabin
section
which
had
descended
as
only
parachutes
could
possibly
have
done
two
destroyers
steamed
onward
underneath
those
drifting
specks
to
pick
them
up
when
they
should
come
down
but
the
other
nearby
destroyers
had
other
business
in
hand
the
two
trailing
destroyers
reached
goa
harbor
within
hours
of
the
landing
of
the
four
from
space
a
helicopter
found
the
first
three
of
them
within
hours
after
that
they
were
twenty
miles
inland
and
thirty
south
from
goa
mike
was
located
until
the
next
day
he
been
shot
out
of
the
ship
cabin
earlier
and
higher
he
was
lighter
and
floated
farther
but
things
satisfying
things
had
happened
in
the
interval
sitting
almost
dizzily
on
the
bunk
in
the
swiftly
roaring
plane
while
blood
began
sluggishly
to
flow
through
his
body
joe
remembered
the
gleeful
unofficial
news
passed
around
on
the
destroyers
they
waited
for
mike
to
be
brought
in
but
they
rejoiced
vengefully
the
report
was
quite
true
but
it
never
reached
the
newspapers
nobody
would
ever
admit
it
but
the
rockets
aimed
at
the
returning
space
ships
had
been
spotted
by
navy
radar
as
they
went
up
from
the
arabian
sea
and
the
ships
of
the
radar
patrol
could
do
anything
about
the
rockets
but
they
could
and
did
converge
savagely
upon
the
places
from
which
they
had
been
launched
planes
sped
out
to
spot
and
bomb
destroyers
arrived
somewhere
there
was
a
navy
department
that
could
write
off
two
modern
submarines
with
equipment
last
heard
from
west
of
india
american
naval
men
would
profess
bland
ignorance
of
any
such
event
but
there
were
acres
of
dead
fish
floating
on
the
ocean
where
had
hunted
down
and
killed
two
shapes
much
too
big
to
be
fish
which
did
float
when
they
were
killed
and
which
would
never
report
back
how
they
destroyed
two
space
ships
there
be
seagulls
feasting
over
that
area
and
there
be
vague
tales
about
the
happening
in
the
bazaars
of
hadhramaut
but
nobody
would
ever
admit
knowing
anything
for
certain
but
joe
knew
he
got
to
his
feet
wobbling
a
little
bit
in
the
soaring
plane
he
ached
everywhere
his
muscles
protested
the
strain
of
holding
him
erect
he
held
fast
summoning
strength
before
his
little
ship
broke
up
he
been
shaken
intolerably
and
his
body
had
weighed
half
a
ton
where
his
had
held
him
his
body
was
one
wide
bruise
there
been
that
killing
acceleration
when
the
ship
split
in
two
the
others
except
mike
were
in
as
bad
a
case
or
worse
haney
and
the
chief
were
like
men
who
been
rolled
down
mount
everest
in
a
barrel
all
of
them
had
slept
for
fourteen
hours
straight
before
they
even
woke
up
for
food
even
now
joe
did
remember
boarding
this
plane
or
getting
into
the
bunk
he
probably
been
carried
in
joe
stood
up
doggedly
until
enough
strength
came
to
him
to
justify
his
sitting
down
again
he
began
to
dress
it
was
astonishing
how
many
places
about
his
body
were
sore
to
the
touch
it
was
startling
how
heavy
his
arms
and
legs
felt
and
how
much
of
an
effort
even
sitting
erect
was
but
he
began
to
remember
mike
adventure
and
managed
to
grin
feebly
it
was
the
only
thing
worth
a
smile
in
all
the
things
that
had
happened
because
mike
landing
had
been
quite
unlike
the
others
joe
and
the
chief
landed
near
the
edge
of
a
jungle
haney
landed
in
a
canebrake
but
mike
came
floating
down
from
the
sky
swaying
splendidly
into
the
estate
of
a
minor
godling
he
was
relatively
unharmed
by
the
he
had
the
strength
of
muscles
depends
on
their
but
their
weight
depends
on
their
volume
the
strength
of
a
man
depends
on
the
square
of
his
size
but
his
weight
on
the
cube
so
mike
had
taken
the
deceleration
and
the
murderous
vibration
almost
in
his
stride
he
floated
longer
and
landed
more
gently
than
the
rest
joe
grinned
painfully
at
the
memory
of
mike
tale
he
come
on
board
the
rescue
destroyer
in
a
towering
explosive
rage
when
his
let
him
down
out
of
the
sky
it
deposited
him
gently
on
ploughed
fields
not
far
from
a
small
and
primitive
hindu
village
been
seen
to
descend
from
the
heavens
he
was
a
midget
not
as
other
men
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
space
suit
with
glittering
metal
harness
the
pagan
villagers
greeted
him
with
rapture
when
the
found
mike
they
were
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
massacre
by
mike
adoring
natives
had
seized
upon
him
conveyed
him
in
high
state
to
a
red
mud
temple
seemingly
tried
to
suffocate
him
with
evidences
of
their
pride
and
joy
at
his
arrival
and
maidens
were
trying
hopefully
to
win
his
approval
of
their
dancing
but
the
found
him
with
a
club
in
his
hand
and
blood
in
his
eye
setting
out
furiously
to
change
the
tone
of
his
reception
joe
still
did
know
all
the
details
but
he
tried
to
concentrate
on
what
he
did
know
as
he
put
his
uniform
on
again
he
did
want
to
think
how
little
it
meant
now
the
silver
space
ship
badge
did
mean
a
thing
any
more
there
were
any
more
space
ships
the
platform
a
ship
but
a
satellite
there
never
been
but
two
ships
both
had
ceased
to
exist
joe
walked
painfully
forward
in
the
huge
roaring
plane
the
motors
made
a
constant
humming
thunder
in
his
ears
it
was
not
easy
to
walk
he
held
on
to
handholds
as
he
moved
but
he
progressed
past
the
bunk
space
and
there
was
mike
sitting
at
a
table
and
stuffing
himself
with
good
honest
food
there
was
a
glass
port
beside
him
and
joe
caught
a
glimpse
of
illimitable
distances
filled
with
cloud
and
sky
and
sea
mike
nodded
he
did
offer
to
help
joe
walk
that
would
have
been
practical
he
waited
until
joe
sank
into
a
seat
opposite
good
sleep
asked
mike
i
guess
so
said
joe
he
added
ruefully
it
hurts
to
nod
and
i
think
it
would
hurt
worse
to
shake
my
head
what
the
matter
with
me
mike
i
did
get
banged
up
in
the
landing
you
got
banged
up
before
you
landed
said
mike
worse
than
that
you
spent
better
than
six
weeks
out
of
gravity
where
in
an
average
day
you
took
less
actual
exercise
than
a
guy
in
bed
with
two
broken
legs
joe
eased
himself
back
into
his
chair
he
felt
about
years
old
somebody
poked
a
head
into
view
and
withdrew
it
joe
lifted
his
arm
and
regarded
it
weighty
i
guess
you
right
mike
i
know
i
right
said
mike
if
you
spent
six
weeks
in
bed
expect
to
feel
wobbly
when
you
tried
to
walk
up
on
the
platform
you
did
even
use
energy
to
stand
up
we
did
realize
it
but
we
were
living
like
invalids
we
get
our
strength
back
but
next
time
take
measures
huh
take
a
trip
to
mars
in
free
fall
and
by
the
time
a
guy
got
there
his
muscles
be
so
flabby
he
could
stand
up
in
something
got
to
be
done
about
that
joe
joe
said
sombrely
something
got
to
be
done
about
space
ships
before
that
comes
up
again
somebody
appeared
with
a
tray
there
was
food
on
it
smoking
hot
food
joe
looked
at
it
and
knew
that
his
appetite
anyhow
was
back
to
earth
normal
thanks
he
mumbled
appreciatively
and
attacked
the
food
mike
drank
his
coffee
then
he
said
joe
do
you
know
anything
about
powder
metallurgy
joe
shrugged
it
hurt
powder
metallurgy
yes
i
seen
it
used
at
my
father
plant
they
made
small
precision
parts
with
it
why
know
if
anybody
ever
made
a
weld
with
it
asked
mike
joe
chewed
then
he
said
i
think
so
yes
at
the
plant
they
did
they
had
trouble
getting
the
surfaces
properly
cleaned
for
welding
but
they
managed
it
why
one
more
question
said
mike
tensely
how
much
portland
cement
is
used
to
make
a
cubic
yard
of
concrete
i
would
know
admitted
joe
why
what
all
this
about
haney
and
the
chief
those
two
big
apes
have
been
kidding
me
as
long
as
they
could
stay
awake
for
what
happened
to
me
when
i
landed
those
infernal
savages
mike
seethed
they
got
my
clothes
off
and
they
had
me
smeared
all
over
with
butter
and
necklaces
around
my
neck
and
flowers
in
my
hair
they
thought
i
was
some
kind
of
heathen
god
hanuman
somebody
told
me
the
hindu
he
raged
and
those
two
big
apes
think
it
funny
joe
i
never
knew
i
all
the
words
for
the
cussings
i
gave
those
heathen
before
our
fellas
found
me
and
haney
and
the
chief
will
drive
me
crazy
if
i
ca
slap
down
powder
metallurgy
does
the
trick
from
what
you
told
me
that
okay
then
he
stood
up
and
stalked
toward
the
front
of
the
plane
joe
roused
himself
with
an
effort
he
turned
to
look
about
him
haney
lay
slumped
in
a
reclining
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
plane
cabin
his
eyes
were
closed
the
chief
lay
limply
in
another
chair
he
smiled
faintly
at
joe
but
he
did
try
to
talk
he
was
too
tired
the
return
to
normal
gravity
bothered
him
as
it
did
joe
joe
looked
out
the
window
in
neat
geometric
spacing
on
either
side
of
the
transport
there
were
fighter
jets
there
was
another
flight
above
and
farther
away
joe
saw
suddenly
a
of
planes
from
the
farther
formation
they
dived
down
through
the
clouds
he
never
knew
what
they
went
to
look
for
or
what
they
found
he
went
groggily
back
to
his
bunk
in
a
strange
and
embarrassing
weakness
he
woke
when
the
plane
landed
he
did
know
where
it
might
be
it
was
he
knew
an
island
he
could
see
the
wide
white
of
the
runways
he
could
see
in
clouds
over
at
the
edge
the
plane
trundled
and
lurched
slowly
to
a
stop
a
came
growling
up
and
somebody
led
cables
from
it
up
into
the
engines
somebody
watched
dials
and
waved
a
hand
there
was
silence
there
was
stillness
joe
heard
voices
and
footsteps
presently
he
heard
the
dull
booming
of
surf
the
plane
seemed
to
wait
for
a
very
long
time
then
there
was
a
faint
faint
distant
whine
of
jets
and
a
plane
came
from
the
east
it
was
first
a
dot
and
then
a
vague
shape
and
then
an
infinitely
graceful
dark
object
which
swooped
down
and
landed
at
the
other
end
of
the
strip
it
came
taxiing
up
alongside
the
transport
ship
and
stopped
an
officer
in
uniform
climbed
out
waved
his
hand
and
walked
over
to
the
transport
he
climbed
up
the
ladder
and
the
pilot
and
followed
him
they
took
their
places
the
door
closed
one
by
one
the
jets
chugged
then
roared
to
life
the
officer
talked
to
the
pilot
and
for
a
moment
he
came
down
the
aisle
toward
joe
mike
the
midget
regarded
him
suspiciously
the
plane
stirred
the
newly
arrived
officer
said
pleasantly
the
navy
department
sent
me
out
here
kenmore
to
be
briefed
on
what
you
know
and
to
do
a
little
briefing
in
turn
the
transport
plane
turned
clumsily
and
began
to
taxi
down
the
runway
it
jolted
and
bumped
over
the
tarmac
then
lifted
and
joe
saw
that
the
island
was
nearly
all
airfield
there
were
a
few
small
buildings
and
hangars
beyond
the
field
proper
there
was
a
ring
of
white
surf
that
was
all
the
rest
was
ocean
i
have
much
briefing
to
do
admitted
joe
then
he
looked
at
the
briefcase
the
other
man
opened
it
had
sheets
and
sheets
of
paper
in
it
hundreds
it
seemed
they
were
filled
with
questions
he
be
called
on
to
find
answers
for
most
of
them
and
to
admit
he
did
know
the
answers
to
the
rest
when
he
was
through
with
this
questioning
every
possible
useful
fact
he
knew
would
be
on
file
for
future
use
and
now
he
wrily
recognized
that
this
was
part
payment
for
the
efficiency
and
speed
with
which
the
navy
had
trailed
them
on
their
landing
and
for
the
use
of
a
transport
plane
to
take
them
back
to
the
united
states
i
try
to
answer
what
i
can
he
said
cautiously
but
what
you
to
brief
me
about
that
you
not
back
on
earth
yet
said
the
officer
curtly
pulling
out
the
first
sheaf
of
questions
officially
you
have
even
started
back
ostensibly
you
still
on
the
platform
joe
blinked
at
him
if
your
return
were
known
continued
the
lieutenant
the
public
would
want
to
make
heroes
of
you
first
space
travelers
and
so
on
want
you
on
television
all
of
you
telling
about
your
adventures
and
your
return
inevitably
what
happened
to
your
ship
would
leak
out
and
if
the
public
knew
you
been
waylaid
and
shot
down
there
be
demands
that
the
government
take
violent
action
to
avenge
the
attack
it
be
something
like
the
tumult
over
the
sinking
of
the
or
the
or
even
pearl
harbor
it
much
better
for
your
return
to
be
a
secret
for
now
joe
said
wrily
i
do
think
any
of
us
want
to
be
ridden
around
to
have
dumped
on
us
that
part
all
right
i
sure
the
others
will
agree
good
one
more
difficulty
we
had
two
space
ships
now
we
have
none
our
most
likely
enemies
have
only
been
building
rockets
they
got
a
space
fleet
coming
along
intelligence
just
found
out
they
nearly
ready
for
trial
trips
they
been
yelling
to
high
heaven
that
we
were
building
a
space
fleet
to
conquer
the
world
we
were
they
were
and
it
looks
very
much
as
if
they
may
have
beaten
us
the
lieutenant
got
out
the
dreary
mass
of
papers
intended
to
call
for
every
conscious
or
unconscious
observation
joe
might
have
made
in
space
it
was
the
equivalent
of
the
interviews
extracted
from
fliers
after
a
bombing
raid
and
it
was
necessary
but
joe
was
very
tired
wearily
he
said
start
your
questions
i
try
to
answer
them
they
arrived
in
bootstrap
some
hours
after
the
crashing
of
their
ship
joe
at
least
had
slept
nearly
thirty
of
those
hours
so
while
he
was
still
wobbly
on
his
feet
and
would
be
for
days
to
come
his
disposition
was
vastly
improved
there
was
nobody
waiting
on
the
airfield
by
the
town
of
bootstrap
but
as
they
landed
a
black
car
came
smoothly
out
and
stopped
close
by
the
transport
joe
got
down
and
climbed
into
it
sally
holt
was
inside
she
took
both
his
hands
and
cried
and
he
was
horribly
embarrassed
when
the
chief
came
blundering
into
the
car
after
him
but
the
chief
growled
if
he
did
kiss
you
sally
i
going
to
kick
his
pants
for
him
he
he
did
said
sally
gulping
and
i
glad
you
back
chief
and
haney
and
mike
mike
grinned
as
he
climbed
in
the
back
too
haney
crowded
in
after
him
they
filled
the
rear
of
the
car
entirely
it
started
off
swiftly
across
the
field
swerving
to
the
roadway
that
led
to
the
highway
out
of
bootstrap
to
the
shed
it
sped
out
that
long
white
concrete
ribbon
and
the
desert
was
abruptly
all
around
them
far
ahead
the
great
round
of
the
shed
looked
like
a
on
the
horizon
it
good
to
be
back
said
the
chief
warmly
i
feel
like
i
weigh
a
ton
but
it
good
to
be
back
mike
the
only
one
who
was
happier
out
yonder
he
figures
he
belongs
there
i
got
a
story
to
tell
you
sally
chief
said
mike
fiercely
shut
up
wo
said
the
chief
amiably
sally
this
guy
mike
mike
went
pale
you
too
big
to
kill
he
said
bitterly
but
try
it
the
chief
grunted
at
him
quit
being
modest
sally
mike
flung
himself
at
the
chief
literally
snarling
his
small
fist
hit
the
chief
face
and
mike
was
small
but
he
was
not
puny
the
crack
of
the
impact
was
loud
in
the
car
haney
grabbed
there
was
a
frenzied
struggling
then
mike
was
helplessly
wrapped
in
haney
arms
incoherent
with
fury
and
shame
crazy
fool
grunted
the
chief
feeling
his
jaw
what
the
matter
with
you
do
you
feel
good
he
was
angry
but
he
was
more
concerned
mike
was
white
and
raging
you
tell
that
he
panted
shrilly
and
so
help
me
what
got
into
you
demanded
haney
anxiously
i
be
bragging
i
would
if
i
got
a
brainstorm
like
you
did
that
guy
sanford
woulda
wiped
us
all
out
the
chief
said
angrily
between
unease
and
puzzlement
i
never
knew
you
to
go
off
your
nut
like
this
before
what
got
into
you
anyway
mike
gulped
suddenly
haney
still
held
him
firmly
but
both
haney
and
the
chief
were
looking
at
him
with
worried
eyes
and
mike
said
desperately
you
were
going
to
tell
sally
the
chief
snorted
huh
you
fool
little
runt
no
i
was
going
to
tell
her
about
you
opening
up
that
airlock
when
sanford
locked
us
out
sure
i
kidded
you
about
what
you
talking
about
sure
i
going
to
do
it
again
but
that
amongst
us
i
do
tell
that
outside
haney
made
an
inarticulate
exclamation
he
understood
and
he
was
relieved
but
he
looked
disgusted
he
released
mike
abruptly
rumbling
to
himself
he
stared
out
the
window
and
mike
stood
upright
an
absurd
small
figure
his
face
worked
a
little
okay
said
mike
with
a
little
difficulty
i
was
dumb
only
chief
you
owe
me
a
sock
on
the
jaw
when
you
feel
like
it
i
take
it
he
swallowed
sally
was
watching
sally
said
mike
bitterly
i
a
bigger
fool
than
i
look
i
thought
the
chief
was
going
to
tell
you
what
happened
when
i
landed
i
i
floated
down
in
a
village
over
there
in
india
and
those
crazy
never
seen
a
parachute
and
they
began
to
yell
and
make
gestures
and
first
thing
i
knew
they
had
a
sort
of
litter
and
were
piling
me
in
it
and
throwing
flowers
all
over
me
and
there
was
a
procession
sally
listened
blankly
mike
told
the
tale
of
his
shame
with
the
very
quintessence
of
bitter
resentment
when
he
got
to
his
installation
in
a
mud
temple
and
the
reverent
and
forcible
removal
of
his
clothes
so
he
could
be
greased
with
butter
sally
lips
began
to
twitch
at
the
picture
of
mike
in
a
red
loincloth
squirming
furiously
while
admirers
zestfully
sang
his
praises
howling
his
rage
while
they
celebrated
some
sort
of
pious
festival
in
honor
of
his
arrival
sally
broke
down
and
laughed
helplessly
mike
stared
at
her
aghast
he
felt
that
he
hated
the
chief
when
he
thought
the
chief
was
going
to
tell
the
tale
on
him
as
a
joke
he
told
it
on
himself
as
a
penance
in
the
place
of
the
blow
he
given
the
chief
and
which
the
chief
would
return
to
mike
it
was
still
tragedy
it
was
still
an
outrage
to
his
dignity
but
sally
was
laughing
she
rocked
back
and
forth
next
to
joe
helpless
with
mirth
oh
mike
she
gasped
it
beautiful
they
must
have
been
saying
such
lovely
respectful
things
while
you
were
calling
them
names
and
wanting
to
kill
them
they
have
been
bragging
to
each
other
about
how
you
were
visiting
them
because
they
been
such
good
people
and
this
was
the
reward
of
lives
and
you
you
she
leaned
against
joe
and
shook
the
car
went
on
the
chief
chuckled
haney
grinned
joe
watched
mike
as
this
new
aspect
of
his
disgrace
got
into
his
consciousness
it
had
occurred
to
mike
before
that
anybody
but
himself
had
been
ridiculous
it
had
occurred
to
him
until
he
lost
his
temper
that
haney
and
the
chief
would
ride
him
mercilessly
among
themselves
but
would
not
dream
of
letting
anybody
outside
the
gang
do
so
presently
mike
managed
to
grin
a
little
it
was
a
twisty
grin
and
not
altogether
mirthful
yeah
he
said
wrily
i
see
it
they
were
crazy
too
i
should
had
more
sense
than
to
get
mad
then
his
grin
grew
a
trifle
twistier
i
did
tell
you
that
the
thing
that
made
me
maddest
was
when
they
wanted
to
put
earrings
on
me
i
grabbed
a
club
then
and
uh
persuaded
them
i
did
like
the
idea
sally
chortled
the
picture
of
the
small
truculent
mike
in
frenzied
revolt
with
a
club
against
the
idea
of
being
decked
with
jewelry
mike
turned
to
the
two
big
men
and
shoved
at
them
imperiously
move
over
he
growled
if
you
two
big
lummoxes
had
dropped
in
on
those
crazy
goofs
instead
of
me
thought
you
were
elephants
and
set
you
to
work
hauling
logs
he
squirmed
to
a
seat
between
them
he
still
looked
ashamed
but
it
was
shame
of
a
different
sort
now
he
looked
as
if
he
wished
he
mistrusted
his
friends
for
even
a
moment
and
he
included
sally
anyhow
he
said
suddenly
in
a
different
tone
maybe
it
did
do
some
good
for
me
to
get
all
worked
up
i
got
kind
of
frantic
i
figured
somebody
made
a
fool
of
me
and
i
was
going
to
put
something
over
on
you
mike
said
sally
reproachfully
not
like
you
think
sally
said
mike
grinning
a
little
i
made
up
my
mind
to
beat
these
lummoxes
at
their
own
game
i
asked
joe
about
my
brainstorm
in
the
plane
he
did
know
what
i
was
driving
at
but
he
said
what
i
hoped
was
so
so
i
telling
you
and
he
added
fiercely
if
it
any
good
everybody
gets
credit
for
it
because
all
of
us
four
even
two
big
apes
who
try
kidding
are
responsible
for
it
he
glared
at
them
joe
asked
what
is
it
mike
i
think
said
mike
i
think
i
got
a
trick
to
make
space
ships
quicker
than
anybody
ever
dreamed
of
joe
says
you
can
make
a
weld
with
powder
metallurgy
and
i
think
we
can
use
that
trick
to
make
ships
lighter
and
stronger
and
tighter
and
fast
enough
to
make
your
head
swim
and
you
guys
are
in
on
it
the
black
car
braked
by
the
entrance
to
the
security
offices
outside
the
shed
it
looked
completely
deserted
there
was
only
a
skeleton
force
here
since
the
platform
had
been
launched
three
months
before
there
was
almost
nobody
to
be
seen
but
mike
pressed
his
lips
pugnaciously
together
as
they
got
out
of
the
car
and
went
inside
the
four
of
them
with
sally
went
along
the
empty
corridors
to
the
major
office
he
was
waiting
for
them
he
shook
hands
all
around
but
it
was
not
possible
for
major
holt
to
give
an
impression
of
cordiality
i
very
glad
to
see
all
of
you
back
he
said
curtly
it
did
look
like
you
make
it
joe
you
will
be
able
to
reach
your
father
by
telephone
as
soon
as
you
finish
here
i
ah
thought
it
would
not
be
indiscreet
to
tell
him
you
had
landed
safely
though
i
did
ask
him
to
keep
the
fact
to
himself
thank
you
sir
said
joe
you
answered
most
of
the
questions
you
needed
to
answer
on
the
plane
added
the
major
grimly
and
now
you
may
want
to
ask
some
you
know
there
is
no
ship
for
you
you
know
that
the
enemies
of
the
platform
copied
our
rocket
fuel
you
know
they
made
rockets
with
it
met
them
and
intelligence
says
they
building
a
fleet
of
space
ships
not
for
space
exploration
but
simply
to
smash
the
platform
and
get
set
for
an
ultimatum
to
the
united
states
to
backwater
or
be
bombarded
from
space
mike
said
crisply
how
long
before
they
can
do
it
major
holt
turned
uncordial
eyes
upon
him
it
anybody
guess
why
we
been
working
something
out
said
mike
firmly
but
in
part
untruthfully
he
stood
sturdily
before
the
major
desk
which
he
barely
topped
the
four
of
us
have
been
working
it
out
joe
says
they
done
powder
metallurgy
welds
back
at
his
father
plant
joe
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
me
we
been
working
out
an
idea
major
holt
waited
his
hands
moved
nervously
on
his
desk
joe
looked
at
mike
haney
and
the
chief
regarded
him
warily
the
chief
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
it
take
a
minute
to
get
it
across
said
mike
you
have
to
think
of
concrete
first
when
you
want
to
make
a
cubic
yard
of
concrete
you
take
a
cubic
yard
of
gravel
then
you
add
some
sand
just
enough
to
fill
in
the
cracks
between
the
gravel
then
you
put
in
some
cement
it
goes
in
the
cracks
between
the
grains
of
sand
a
little
bit
of
cement
makes
a
lot
of
concrete
see
major
holt
frowned
but
he
knew
these
four
i
see
but
i
understand
you
can
weld
metals
together
with
powder
at
less
than
red
heat
you
can
take
steel
filings
for
sand
and
steel
turnings
for
gravel
and
powdered
steel
for
cement
joe
jolted
erect
he
looked
startledly
at
haney
and
the
chief
and
haney
mouth
was
dropping
open
a
great
dreamy
light
seemed
to
be
bursting
upon
him
the
chief
regarded
mike
with
very
bright
eyes
and
mike
sturdily
forcefully
coldly
made
a
sort
of
speech
in
his
small
and
brittle
voice
things
could
be
made
of
solid
steel
he
said
sharply
without
rolling
or
milling
or
the
metal
and
without
riveting
or
the
parts
together
the
trick
was
powder
metallurgy
very
finely
powdered
metal
packed
tightly
and
heated
to
a
relatively
low
temperature
sintered
is
the
word
becomes
a
solid
mass
even
alloys
can
be
made
by
mixing
powdered
metals
the
process
had
been
used
only
for
small
objects
but
there
was
the
analogy
to
concrete
a
very
little
powder
could
weld
much
metal
in
the
form
of
turnings
and
smaller
bits
and
the
result
would
be
solid
steel
then
mike
grew
impassioned
there
was
a
wooden
mockup
of
a
space
ship
in
the
shed
he
said
it
was
an
absolutely
accurate
replica
in
wood
of
the
ships
that
had
been
destroyed
but
one
could
take
castings
of
it
and
use
them
for
molds
and
fill
them
with
powder
and
filings
and
turnings
and
heat
them
not
even
and
there
would
be
steel
hulls
in
one
piece
solid
steel
hulls
needing
no
riveting
nor
anything
else
and
one
could
do
it
fast
while
the
first
hull
was
fitting
out
a
second
could
be
molded
the
chief
roared
you
fool
little
runt
he
bellowed
tryin
to
give
us
credit
for
that
you
got
more
sense
than
any
of
us
you
worked
that
out
in
your
own
head
haney
rubbed
his
hands
together
he
said
softly
i
like
that
i
do
like
that
major
holt
turned
his
eyes
to
joe
what
your
opinion
i
think
it
the
sort
of
thing
sir
that
a
professional
engineer
would
say
was
a
good
idea
but
not
practical
he
mean
it
would
be
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
working
but
i
like
to
ask
my
father
they
have
done
powder
welding
at
the
plant
back
home
sir
major
holt
nodded
call
your
father
if
it
looks
promising
i
pull
what
wires
i
can
joe
went
out
with
the
others
mike
was
sweating
all
unconsciously
he
twisted
his
hands
one
within
the
other
he
had
had
many
humiliations
because
he
was
small
but
lately
he
had
humiliated
himself
by
not
believing
in
his
friends
now
he
needed
desperately
to
do
something
that
would
reflect
credit
on
them
as
well
as
himself
joe
made
the
phone
call
as
he
closed
the
door
of
the
booth
he
heard
the
chief
kidding
mike
blandly
hey
einstein
said
the
chief
how
about
putting
that
brain
of
yours
to
work
on
a
drive
but
then
he
began
to
struggle
with
the
long
distance
operator
it
took
minutes
to
get
the
plant
and
then
it
took
time
to
get
to
the
point
because
his
father
insisted
on
asking
anxiously
how
he
was
and
if
he
was
hurt
in
any
way
personal
stuff
but
joe
finally
managed
to
explain
that
this
call
dealt
with
the
desperate
need
to
do
something
about
a
space
fleet
his
father
said
grimly
yes
the
situation
does
look
too
good
right
now
joe
try
this
on
for
size
sir
said
joe
he
outlined
mike
scheme
his
father
interrupted
only
to
ask
crisp
questions
about
the
mockup
of
the
tender
already
in
existence
though
made
of
wood
then
he
said
go
on
son
joe
finished
he
heard
his
father
speaking
to
someone
away
from
the
phone
questions
and
answers
and
then
orders
his
father
spoke
to
him
direct
it
looks
promising
joe
said
his
father
right
here
at
the
plant
we
got
the
gang
that
can
do
it
if
anybody
can
i
getting
a
plane
and
coming
out
there
fast
get
major
holt
to
clear
things
for
me
this
is
no
time
for
red
tape
if
he
has
trouble
i
pull
some
wires
myself
then
i
can
tell
mike
it
good
stuff
it
not
good
stuff
said
his
father
there
are
about
things
wrong
with
it
at
first
glance
but
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
one
or
two
and
we
lick
the
rest
you
tell
your
friend
mike
i
want
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
i
hope
to
do
it
tonight
he
hung
up
and
joe
went
out
of
the
phone
booth
mike
looked
at
him
with
yearning
eyes
joe
lied
a
little
because
mike
rated
it
my
father
on
the
way
here
to
help
make
it
work
he
told
mike
then
he
added
untruthfully
he
said
he
thought
he
knew
all
the
big
men
in
his
line
and
where
you
been
that
he
has
heard
of
you
he
turned
away
as
the
chief
whooped
with
glee
he
hurried
back
to
major
holt
as
the
chief
and
haney
began
zestfully
to
manhandle
mike
in
celebration
of
his
genius
the
major
held
up
his
hand
as
joe
entered
he
was
using
the
desk
phone
joe
waited
when
he
hung
up
joe
reported
the
major
seemed
unsurprised
yes
i
had
washington
on
the
wire
he
said
detachedly
i
talked
to
a
personal
friend
who
a
general
there
will
be
action
started
at
the
pentagon
when
you
came
in
i
was
arranging
with
the
largest
producers
of
products
in
the
country
to
send
their
best
men
here
by
plane
they
will
start
at
once
now
i
have
to
get
in
touch
with
some
other
people
joe
gaped
at
him
the
major
moved
impatiently
waiting
for
joe
to
leave
joe
gulped
excuse
me
sir
but
my
father
did
say
it
was
certain
he
just
thinks
it
can
be
made
to
work
he
not
sure
i
did
even
wait
for
that
something
has
to
turn
up
to
take
care
of
this
situation
said
the
major
with
asperity
it
has
to
this
particular
scheme
may
not
work
but
if
it
does
something
will
come
out
of
the
work
on
it
you
should
look
at
a
cent
piece
occasionally
joe
he
moved
impatiently
and
joe
went
out
sally
was
smiling
in
the
outer
office
there
were
whoopings
in
the
corridor
beyond
the
chief
and
haney
were
celebrating
mike
brainstorm
with
salutary
indignity
because
if
they
did
make
a
joke
of
it
he
might
cry
with
joy
things
look
better
they
do
said
joe
if
it
only
works
then
he
hunted
in
his
pocket
he
found
a
quarter
and
examined
it
curiously
on
one
side
he
found
nothing
the
major
could
have
referred
to
on
the
other
side
though
just
by
george
washington
chin
he
put
the
quarter
away
and
took
sally
arm
it
be
all
right
he
said
slowly
but
there
were
times
when
it
seemed
in
doubt
joe
father
arrived
by
plane
at
sunset
of
that
same
day
and
he
and
three
men
from
the
kenmore
precision
tool
company
instantly
closeted
themselves
with
mike
in
major
holt
quarters
the
powder
metallurgy
men
turned
up
an
hour
later
and
a
general
from
washington
they
joined
the
highly
technical
discussion
joe
waited
around
outside
feeling
left
out
of
things
he
sat
on
the
porch
with
sally
while
the
moon
rose
over
the
desert
and
stars
shone
down
inside
matters
of
high
importance
were
being
battled
over
with
the
informality
and
heat
with
which
practical
men
get
things
settled
but
joe
was
in
on
it
he
said
annoyedly
you
think
my
have
something
to
say
to
me
in
all
this
mess
after
all
i
have
been
well
i
have
been
places
but
all
he
said
was
are
you
son
where
this
mike
you
talked
about
sally
said
calmly
i
know
just
how
you
feel
you
made
me
feel
that
way
she
looked
up
at
the
moon
i
thought
about
you
all
the
time
you
were
gone
and
i
prayed
for
you
joe
and
now
you
back
and
not
even
busy
but
you
do
it
would
be
nice
for
you
to
think
about
me
for
a
while
i
am
thinking
about
you
said
joe
indignantly
now
what
said
sally
interestedly
in
the
world
could
you
be
thinking
about
me
he
wanted
to
scowl
at
her
but
he
grinned
instead
time
passed
hours
then
days
things
began
to
happen
trucks
appeared
loaded
down
with
sacks
of
white
powder
the
powder
was
very
messily
mixed
with
water
and
smeared
lavishly
over
the
now
waterproofed
wooden
mockup
of
a
space
ship
it
came
off
again
in
sections
of
white
plaster
which
were
numbered
and
set
to
dry
in
warm
chambers
that
were
constructed
with
almost
magical
speed
more
trucks
arrived
bearing
such
diverse
objects
as
loads
of
steel
turnings
a
regenerative
plant
from
a
gaswell
it
could
cool
metal
down
to
the
point
where
it
crumbled
to
impalpable
powder
at
a
blow
and
assorted
fuel
tanks
dynamos
and
electronic
machinery
ten
days
after
mike
first
proposal
of
concreted
steel
as
a
material
for
space
ship
construction
the
parts
of
the
first
casting
of
the
mockup
were
assembled
they
were
a
mold
for
the
hull
of
a
space
ship
there
were
more
plaster
sections
for
a
second
mold
ready
to
be
dried
out
now
but
meanwhile
vehicles
like
concrete
mixers
mixed
turnings
and
filings
and
powder
in
vast
quantities
and
poured
the
dry
mass
here
and
there
in
the
first
completed
mold
then
men
began
to
wrap
the
gigantic
object
with
iron
wire
presently
that
iron
wire
glowed
slightly
and
the
whole
huge
mold
grew
hotter
and
hotter
and
hotter
and
after
a
time
it
was
allowed
to
cool
but
that
did
not
mean
a
ceasing
of
activity
the
plaster
casts
had
been
made
while
the
concreting
process
was
worked
out
the
concreting
process
including
the
heating
was
in
action
while
fittings
were
being
flown
to
the
shed
but
other
hulls
were
being
formed
by
formation
even
before
the
first
mold
was
taken
down
when
the
plaster
sections
came
off
there
was
a
long
gleaming
metal
hull
waiting
for
the
fittings
it
was
a
replacement
of
one
of
the
two
space
craft
ready
for
fitting
out
some
six
weeks
ahead
of
schedule
next
day
there
was
a
second
metal
hull
still
too
hot
to
touch
the
day
after
that
there
was
another
then
they
began
to
be
turned
out
at
the
rate
of
two
a
day
and
all
the
vast
expanse
of
the
shed
resounded
with
the
work
on
them
drills
drilled
and
torches
burned
and
hammers
hammered
small
diesels
rumbled
disk
saws
cut
metal
like
butter
by
the
seemingly
impractical
method
of
spinning
at
revolutions
per
minute
convoys
of
motor
busses
rolled
out
from
bootstrap
at
time
and
there
were
again
security
men
at
every
doorway
moving
continually
about
but
it
still
did
look
too
good
there
is
apparently
no
way
to
beat
arithmetic
and
a
definitely
grim
problem
still
remained
ten
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
new
construction
program
joe
and
sally
looked
down
from
a
gallery
high
up
in
the
wall
of
the
shed
acres
of
dark
flooring
lay
beneath
them
there
was
a
spiral
ramp
that
wound
round
and
round
between
the
twin
skins
of
the
dome
it
led
finally
to
the
communications
room
at
the
very
top
of
the
shed
itself
where
joe
and
sally
looked
down
the
floor
was
feet
below
welding
arcs
glittered
rivet
guns
chattered
trucks
came
in
the
doorways
with
materials
and
there
was
already
a
gleaming
row
of
hulls
there
were
eleven
of
them
already
uncovered
and
small
trucks
ran
up
to
their
sides
to
feed
the
crews
such
items
as
air
tanks
and
gyro
assemblies
and
steering
rocket
piping
and
motors
and
short
wave
communicators
and
control
boards
exit
doors
were
being
fitted
the
last
two
hulls
to
be
uncovered
were
being
inspected
with
portable
outfits
in
search
of
flaws
and
there
were
still
other
ungainly
white
molds
which
were
other
hulls
in
process
of
formation
the
metal
still
pouring
into
the
molds
in
powder
form
or
being
tamped
down
or
being
sintered
to
solidity
joe
leaned
on
the
and
said
unhappily
i
ca
help
worrying
even
though
the
platform
has
been
shot
at
since
we
landed
that
was
an
expression
of
what
he
was
thinking
he
was
thinking
about
matters
the
enemies
of
the
platform
would
have
liked
to
know
about
sally
knew
these
matters
too
but
top
secret
information
is
talked
about
by
the
people
who
know
it
unless
they
are
actively
at
work
on
it
at
all
other
times
one
pretends
even
to
himself
that
he
does
know
it
that
is
the
only
possible
way
to
avoid
leaks
the
top
secret
information
was
simply
that
it
was
still
impossible
to
supply
the
platform
ships
could
be
made
faster
than
had
ever
been
dreamed
of
before
but
so
long
as
any
ship
that
went
up
could
be
destroyed
on
the
way
down
the
supply
of
the
platform
was
impractical
but
the
ships
were
being
built
regardless
against
the
time
when
a
way
to
get
them
down
again
was
thought
of
as
of
the
moment
it
had
been
thought
of
yet
but
building
the
ships
anyhow
was
unconscious
genius
because
nobody
but
americans
could
imagine
anything
so
foolish
the
enemies
of
the
platform
and
of
the
united
states
knew
that
production
of
ships
by
some
fantastic
new
method
was
in
progress
the
fact
could
be
hidden
but
nobody
in
a
country
where
material
shortages
were
chronic
could
imagine
building
ships
before
a
way
to
use
them
was
known
so
the
platform
enemies
were
convinced
that
the
united
states
had
something
wholly
new
and
very
remarkable
and
threatened
their
spies
with
unspeakable
fates
if
they
did
find
out
what
it
was
they
did
find
out
the
rulers
of
the
enemy
nations
knew
of
course
that
if
a
new
say
had
been
invented
they
would
very
soon
have
to
change
their
tune
so
there
were
no
more
attacks
on
the
platform
it
floated
serenely
overhead
sending
down
astronomical
observations
and
measurements
and
weather
maps
while
about
it
floated
a
screen
of
garbage
and
discarded
tin
cans
but
joe
and
sally
looked
down
where
the
ships
were
being
built
while
the
problem
of
how
to
use
them
was
debated
it
a
tough
nut
to
crack
said
joe
dourly
it
haunted
him
ships
going
up
had
to
have
crews
crews
had
to
come
down
again
because
they
had
to
leave
supplies
at
the
platform
not
consume
them
there
getting
a
ship
up
to
orbit
was
easier
than
getting
it
down
again
the
navy
been
working
on
light
guided
missiles
said
sally
no
good
snapped
joe
it
was
he
been
asked
for
advice
could
a
space
ship
crew
control
guided
missiles
and
fight
its
way
back
to
ground
with
them
the
answer
was
that
it
could
but
guided
missiles
used
to
fight
one
way
down
would
have
to
be
carried
up
first
and
they
would
weigh
as
much
as
all
the
cargo
a
ship
could
carry
a
ship
that
carried
fighting
rockets
could
carry
cargo
cargo
at
the
platform
was
the
thing
desired
all
that
needed
said
sally
watching
joe
face
is
a
slight
touch
of
genius
there
been
genius
before
now
burning
your
cabin
free
with
flames
haney
idea
growled
joe
dispiritedly
and
making
more
ships
in
a
hurry
with
mike
did
that
said
joe
ruefully
but
you
made
the
for
the
platform
insisted
sally
sanford
had
made
a
wisecrack
said
joe
and
it
just
happened
that
it
made
sense
that
he
had
noticed
he
grimaced
you
say
something
like
that
now
sally
looked
at
him
with
soft
eyes
it
was
really
his
job
this
worrying
the
brains
of
the
armed
forces
were
struggling
with
it
they
were
trying
everything
from
redesigned
rocket
motors
to
really
radical
notions
but
there
was
anything
promising
yet
what
really
needed
said
sally
regretfully
is
a
way
for
ships
to
go
up
to
the
platform
and
not
have
to
come
back
sure
said
joe
ironically
then
he
said
let
go
down
they
started
down
the
long
winding
ramp
which
led
between
the
two
skins
of
the
shed
wall
it
was
quite
empty
this
long
curving
descending
corridor
it
was
remarkably
private
in
a
place
like
the
shed
with
frantic
activity
going
on
all
around
and
even
at
major
holt
quarters
where
sally
lived
and
joe
was
a
guest
there
was
often
a
chance
for
them
to
talk
in
any
sort
of
actual
privacy
but
joe
went
on
scowling
sally
went
with
him
if
she
seemed
to
hang
back
a
little
at
first
he
did
notice
presently
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
ceased
to
try
to
make
him
notice
that
nobody
else
happened
to
be
around
they
made
a
complete
circuit
of
the
shed
within
its
wall
joe
staring
ahead
without
words
then
he
stopped
abruptly
his
expression
was
unbelieving
sally
almost
bumped
into
him
what
the
matter
you
had
it
sally
he
said
amazedly
you
did
it
you
said
it
what
the
touch
of
genius
he
almost
babbled
ships
that
can
go
up
to
the
platform
and
not
have
to
come
back
sally
you
did
it
you
did
it
she
regarded
him
helplessly
he
took
her
by
the
shoulders
as
if
to
shake
her
into
comprehension
but
he
kissed
her
exuberantly
instead
come
on
he
said
urgently
i
got
to
tell
the
gang
he
grabbed
her
hand
and
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
bottom
of
the
ramp
and
sally
with
remarkably
mingled
emotions
showing
on
her
face
was
dragged
in
his
wake
he
was
still
pulling
her
after
him
when
he
found
the
chief
and
haney
and
mike
in
the
room
at
security
where
they
were
practically
lest
their
return
to
earth
become
too
publicly
known
mike
was
stalking
up
and
down
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
glum
as
a
miniature
napoleon
and
talking
bitterly
the
chief
was
sprawled
in
a
chair
haney
sat
upright
regarding
his
knuckles
with
a
thoughtful
air
joe
stepped
inside
the
door
mike
continued
without
a
pause
i
tell
you
if
they
only
use
little
guys
like
me
the
cabin
and
supplies
and
crew
can
be
cut
down
by
tons
even
the
instruments
can
be
smaller
and
weigh
less
four
of
us
in
a
smaller
cabin
less
grub
and
air
and
water
we
save
tons
in
alone
why
ca
you
big
lummoxes
see
it
we
see
it
mike
haney
said
mildly
you
right
but
people
wo
do
it
it
not
fair
but
they
wo
joe
said
beaming
besides
mike
it
bust
up
our
gang
and
just
gotten
the
real
answer
the
answer
is
for
ships
to
go
up
to
the
platform
and
not
come
back
he
grinned
at
them
the
chief
raised
his
eyebrows
haney
turned
his
head
to
stare
joe
said
exuberantly
they
been
talking
about
arming
ships
with
guided
missiles
to
fight
with
too
heavy
of
course
but
if
we
could
handle
guided
missiles
why
could
we
handle
drones
the
three
of
them
gaped
at
him
sally
said
startled
but
but
joe
i
did
we
got
plenty
of
hulls
said
joe
somehow
he
still
looked
astonished
at
what
he
made
of
sally
perfectly
obvious
comment
mike
arranged
for
that
make
say
six
of
into
drones
space
barges
ships
control
them
from
one
manned
ship
the
tug
we
ride
that
take
up
to
the
platform
exactly
like
a
tug
tows
barges
the
will
be
radio
beams
we
have
a
up
and
not
bother
to
bring
the
barges
back
there
wo
be
any
landing
rockets
they
carry
double
cargo
that
the
answer
a
space
tug
hauling
a
tow
to
the
platform
but
joe
insisted
sally
i
did
think
of
the
chief
heaved
himself
up
haney
voice
cut
through
what
the
chief
was
about
to
say
haney
said
drily
sally
if
joe
had
kissed
you
for
thinking
that
up
i
would
makes
me
feel
mighty
dumb
mike
swallowed
then
he
said
loyally
yeah
me
too
made
a
cargo
possible
maybe
but
this
adds
up
what
does
the
major
say
i
have
talked
to
him
i
better
right
away
joe
grinned
i
wanted
to
tell
you
first
the
chief
grunted
good
idea
but
hold
everything
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
the
arithmetic
is
easy
enough
joe
cut
out
the
crew
and
air
and
you
save
something
he
felt
in
another
pocket
leave
off
the
landing
rockets
and
you
save
plenty
more
count
in
the
cargo
you
could
take
anyhow
he
searched
another
pocket
still
and
you
get
tons
of
cargo
per
space
barge
delivered
at
the
platform
six
drones
that
tons
in
one
tow
here
he
found
what
he
wanted
it
was
a
handkerchief
he
thrust
it
upon
joe
wipe
that
lipstick
off
joe
before
you
go
talk
to
the
major
he
sally
father
and
he
might
not
like
it
joe
wiped
at
his
face
sally
her
eyes
shining
took
the
handkerchief
from
him
and
finished
the
job
she
displayed
that
remarkable
insensitivity
of
females
in
situations
productive
of
both
pride
and
embarrassment
when
a
girl
or
a
woman
is
proud
she
is
never
embarrassed
she
and
joe
went
away
and
sally
rushed
right
into
her
father
office
in
fifteen
minutes
technical
men
began
to
arrive
for
conferences
summoned
by
telephone
within
minutes
messengers
carried
orders
out
to
the
shed
floor
and
stopped
the
installation
of
certain
types
of
fittings
in
all
but
one
of
the
hulls
in
an
hour
and
a
half
top
technical
designers
were
doing
the
work
of
foremen
and
getting
things
done
without
benefit
of
blueprints
the
proposal
was
beautifully
simple
to
put
into
practice
control
systems
were
already
in
mass
production
they
could
simply
be
adjusted
to
take
care
of
drones
within
twelve
hours
there
were
of
new
sorts
of
supplies
arriving
at
the
shed
some
were
air
force
supplies
and
some
were
ordnance
and
some
were
strictly
quartermaster
these
were
not
component
parts
of
space
ships
they
were
freight
for
the
platform
and
just
hours
after
joe
and
sally
looked
dispiritedly
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
shed
there
were
seven
gleaming
hulls
in
launching
cages
and
the
unholy
din
of
landing
pushpots
outside
the
shed
they
came
with
hysterical
cries
from
their
airfield
to
the
south
and
they
flopped
flat
with
extravagant
crashings
on
the
desert
outside
the
eastern
door
by
the
time
the
pushpots
had
been
hauled
in
one
by
one
and
had
attached
themselves
to
the
launching
cages
joe
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
had
climbed
into
the
cabin
of
the
one
ship
which
was
not
a
drone
there
were
now
seven
cages
in
all
to
be
hoisted
toward
the
sky
a
great
double
triangular
gore
had
been
jacked
out
and
rolled
aside
to
make
an
exit
in
the
side
of
the
shed
nearly
as
many
pushpots
it
seemed
were
involved
in
this
launching
as
in
the
of
the
platform
itself
the
routine
test
before
set
the
pushpot
motors
to
roaring
inside
the
shed
the
noise
was
the
most
sustained
and
ghastly
tumult
that
had
been
heard
on
earth
since
the
departure
of
the
platform
but
this
launching
was
not
so
impressive
it
was
definitely
untidy
imprecise
and
unmilitary
there
were
seven
hulls
in
cages
surrounded
by
clustering
bellowing
preposterous
groups
of
howling
objects
that
looked
like
black
beetles
one
of
the
seven
hulls
had
eyes
the
others
were
blind
but
they
were
equipped
with
radio
antennae
the
ship
with
eyes
had
several
small
radar
bowls
projecting
from
its
cabin
plating
the
seven
objects
rose
one
by
one
and
went
bellowing
and
blundering
out
to
the
open
air
at
and
feet
above
the
ground
they
jockeyed
into
some
sort
of
formation
with
much
wallowing
and
pitching
and
clumsy
maneuvering
then
without
preliminary
they
started
up
they
rose
swiftly
the
noise
of
their
going
diminished
from
a
bellow
to
a
howl
and
from
a
howl
to
a
moaning
noise
and
then
to
a
faint
faint
hum
presently
that
faded
out
too
all
the
sensations
were
familiar
the
small
fleet
of
improbable
objects
rose
and
rose
of
all
flying
objects
ever
imagined
by
man
the
launching
cages
supported
by
pushpots
were
most
irrational
the
squadron
though
went
bumbling
upward
in
the
manned
ship
joe
was
more
tense
than
on
his
other
if
such
a
thing
was
possible
his
work
was
harder
this
trip
before
he
had
mike
at
communications
and
the
chief
at
the
steering
rockets
while
haney
kept
the
pushpots
balanced
for
thrust
now
joe
flew
the
manned
ship
alone
headphones
and
a
mike
gave
him
communications
with
the
shed
direct
and
the
pushpots
were
balanced
in
groups
which
cost
efficiency
but
helped
on
control
he
would
have
moreover
to
handle
his
own
steering
rockets
during
acceleration
and
when
he
could
and
dared
he
should
supervise
the
others
because
each
of
the
other
three
had
two
to
guide
true
they
had
only
to
keep
their
drones
in
formation
but
joe
had
to
navigate
for
all
the
four
of
them
had
been
assigned
this
flight
because
of
its
importance
they
happened
to
be
the
only
crew
alive
who
had
ever
flown
a
space
ship
designed
for
maneuvering
and
their
experience
consisted
of
a
single
trip
the
jet
stream
was
higher
this
time
than
on
that
other
journey
now
two
months
past
they
blundered
into
it
at
feet
joe
headphones
buzzed
tinnily
radar
from
the
ground
told
him
his
his
ground
speed
his
orbital
speed
and
added
comments
on
the
handling
of
the
drones
the
last
was
not
a
precision
job
on
the
way
up
joe
protested
somebody
ship
number
four
is
lagging
snap
it
up
mike
said
crisply
got
it
joe
coming
up
the
shed
says
three
separate
ships
are
getting
out
of
formation
and
we
need
due
east
pointing
check
it
the
chief
muttered
something
whacky
here
come
round
you
okay
joe
joe
had
no
time
for
reflection
he
was
in
charge
of
the
clumsiest
operation
ever
designed
for
an
exact
result
the
squadron
went
wallowing
toward
the
sky
the
noise
was
horrible
a
tinny
voice
in
his
headphones
are
at
feet
your
curve
is
flattening
you
should
fire
your
jatos
when
practical
you
have
some
leeway
in
rocket
joe
spoke
into
the
extraordinary
maze
of
noise
waves
and
pressure
systems
in
the
air
of
the
cabin
we
should
blast
i
throwing
in
the
series
circuit
for
jatos
try
to
line
up
we
want
the
drones
above
us
and
with
a
spread
remember
go
to
it
he
watched
his
direction
indicator
and
the
small
graphic
indicators
telling
of
the
drones
the
sky
outside
the
ports
was
dark
purple
the
launching
cage
responded
sluggishly
its
open
end
came
around
toward
the
east
it
wobbled
and
wavered
it
touched
the
point
joe
stabbed
the
nothing
happened
he
had
expected
it
the
seven
ships
had
to
keep
in
formation
they
had
to
start
off
on
one
course
with
a
slight
spread
as
a
safety
measure
and
at
one
time
so
the
were
keyed
to
relays
in
series
only
when
all
seven
were
down
at
the
same
time
would
any
of
the
jatos
fire
then
all
would
blast
together
the
pilots
in
the
of
the
pushpots
had
an
extraordinary
view
of
the
scene
at
something
over
twelve
miles
height
seven
aggregations
of
clumsy
black
things
clung
to
frameworks
of
steel
pushing
valorously
far
below
there
were
clouds
and
there
was
earth
there
was
a
horizon
which
wavered
and
tilted
the
pushpots
struggled
with
seeming
lack
of
purpose
one
of
the
seven
seemed
to
drop
below
the
others
they
pointed
vaguely
this
way
and
that
all
of
them
but
gradually
they
seemed
to
arrive
at
an
uncertain
unanimity
joe
pushed
the
again
as
his
own
ship
touched
the
mark
again
nothing
happened
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
haney
pressing
down
both
buttons
the
chief
finger
lifted
mike
pushed
down
one
button
and
held
off
the
other
roarings
and
howlings
of
pushpots
wobblings
and
clumsinesses
of
the
they
hung
in
the
sky
while
the
pushpots
used
up
their
fuel
we
got
to
make
it
soon
said
joe
grimly
we
got
forty
seconds
or
we
have
to
go
down
and
try
again
there
was
a
clock
dial
with
a
red
which
moved
steadily
and
ominously
toward
a
deadline
time
for
firing
up
to
that
deadline
the
pushpots
could
let
the
ships
back
down
to
earth
without
crashing
them
after
it
they
run
out
of
fuel
before
a
landing
could
be
made
the
deadline
came
closer
and
closer
joe
snapped
take
a
degree
leeway
we
got
ten
seconds
he
had
the
manned
ship
nearly
steady
he
held
down
the
holding
aim
by
infinitesimal
movements
of
the
controls
haney
pushed
both
hands
down
raised
one
pushed
again
the
chief
had
one
finger
down
mike
had
both
firing
buttons
depressed
the
chief
pushed
down
his
second
button
quietly
there
was
a
monstrous
impact
every
jato
in
every
pushpot
about
every
launching
cage
fired
at
once
joe
felt
himself
flung
back
into
his
acceleration
chair
six
gravities
he
began
the
horrible
fight
to
stay
alive
while
the
blood
tried
to
drain
from
the
conscious
forepart
of
his
brain
and
while
every
button
of
his
garments
pressed
noticeably
against
him
and
objects
in
his
pockets
pushed
the
sides
of
his
mouth
dragged
back
and
his
cheeks
sagged
and
his
tongue
strove
to
sink
back
into
his
throat
and
strangle
him
it
was
very
bad
it
seemed
to
last
for
centuries
then
the
jatos
burned
out
there
was
that
ghastly
feeling
of
lunging
forward
to
weightlessness
one
instant
joe
body
weighed
half
a
ton
the
next
instant
it
weighed
less
than
a
dust
grain
his
head
throbbed
twice
as
if
his
skull
were
about
to
split
open
and
let
his
brains
run
out
but
these
things
he
had
experienced
before
there
were
pantings
in
the
cabin
about
him
the
ship
fell
it
happened
to
be
going
up
but
the
sensation
and
the
fact
was
free
fall
joe
had
been
through
this
before
too
he
gasped
for
breath
and
croaked
drones
right
said
haney
mike
panted
anxiously
four
off
course
i
fix
it
the
chief
grunted
guttural
mohawk
his
hands
stirred
on
the
panel
for
remote
control
of
the
drones
he
had
to
handle
crazy
he
growled
got
it
now
joe
fire
when
ready
okay
mike
a
pause
okay
joe
pressed
the
for
the
rockets
and
he
was
slammed
back
into
his
acceleration
chair
again
but
this
was
three
gravities
only
pressed
heavily
against
the
acceleration
cushions
he
could
perform
the
navigation
for
the
fleet
he
did
the
had
to
steer
a
true
course
regardless
of
the
vagaries
of
its
rockets
the
drones
had
simply
to
be
kept
in
formation
with
it
the
second
task
was
simpler
but
joe
was
relieved
this
time
of
the
need
to
report
back
a
telemetering
device
took
care
of
that
the
rockets
blasted
and
blasted
and
blasted
the
mere
matter
of
staying
alive
grew
very
tedious
the
ordeal
seemed
to
last
for
centuries
actually
it
could
be
measured
only
in
minutes
but
it
seemed
millennia
before
the
headphones
said
staccato
fashion
are
on
course
and
will
reach
speed
in
fourteen
seconds
i
will
count
for
relays
for
rocket
release
panted
joe
throw
over
three
hands
moved
to
obey
joe
could
release
the
drive
rockets
on
all
seven
ships
at
will
the
voice
counted
nine
eight
seven
six
five
four
three
two
one
cut
joe
pressed
the
the
remnants
of
the
rockets
let
go
they
flashed
off
into
nothingness
at
unbelievable
speed
consuming
themselves
as
they
went
there
was
again
no
weight
this
time
there
was
no
resting
no
eager
gazing
out
the
cabin
ports
now
they
were
curious
they
had
over
a
month
in
space
and
something
like
sixteen
days
back
on
earth
and
now
they
were
back
in
space
again
mike
and
haney
and
the
chief
worked
doggedly
at
their
control
boards
the
radar
bowls
outside
the
cabin
shifted
and
moved
and
quivered
the
six
drone
ships
showed
on
the
screens
but
they
also
had
telemetering
apparatus
they
faithfully
reported
their
condition
and
the
direction
in
which
their
bows
pointed
the
radars
plotted
their
position
with
relation
to
each
other
and
the
presently
joe
cast
a
glance
out
of
a
port
and
saw
that
the
dark
line
of
sunset
was
almost
below
the
had
been
timed
to
get
the
ships
into
earth
shadow
above
the
area
from
which
war
rockets
were
most
likely
to
rise
it
would
prevent
bombing
of
course
but
there
was
a
gadget
joe
spoke
into
the
microphone
reporting
everything
all
right
so
far
but
you
know
it
the
voice
from
solid
ground
said
the
ships
went
on
and
on
and
on
the
chief
muttered
to
himself
and
made
very
minute
adjustments
of
the
movement
of
one
of
his
drones
mike
fussed
with
his
haney
regarded
the
controls
of
his
drones
with
a
profound
calm
nothing
happened
except
that
they
seemed
to
be
falling
into
a
bottomless
pit
and
their
knotted
and
cramped
in
purely
reflex
response
to
the
sensation
even
that
grew
tedious
the
headphones
said
will
enter
earth
shadow
in
three
minutes
prepare
for
joe
said
drily
we
to
prepare
for
combat
the
chief
growled
i
like
to
do
just
that
the
phrasing
of
course
was
intentional
in
case
enemy
ears
were
listening
actually
the
small
fleet
was
to
use
a
variant
on
the
tin
can
shield
which
protected
the
platform
it
would
be
most
effective
if
visual
observation
was
impossible
the
fleet
was
seven
ships
in
very
ragged
formation
most
improbably
after
the
long
acceleration
they
were
still
within
a
globe
of
space
number
four
loitered
behind
but
was
being
brought
up
by
judicious
bursts
of
fire
number
two
was
some
distance
ahead
the
others
were
simply
scattered
they
went
floating
on
like
a
group
of
meteors
out
the
ports
two
of
them
were
visible
the
others
might
be
picked
out
by
the
naked
eye
but
it
was
likely
drone
two
far
ahead
and
clearly
visible
turned
from
a
shining
steel
speck
to
a
reddish
of
light
the
red
color
deepened
it
winked
out
the
sunlight
in
the
ports
of
the
turned
red
then
it
blacked
out
shoot
the
ghosts
said
joe
the
three
pushed
their
buttons
nothing
happened
that
anybody
could
see
actually
though
a
small
gadget
outside
the
hull
began
to
cough
rhythmically
similar
devices
on
the
drones
coughed
too
they
were
small
guns
rifle
shells
fired
missiles
at
random
targets
in
emptiness
they
would
damage
anything
they
hit
they
go
varying
distances
explode
and
shoot
small
lead
shot
ahead
to
check
their
and
then
emit
dense
masses
of
aluminum
foil
there
was
no
air
resistance
the
shredded
foil
would
continue
to
move
through
emptiness
at
the
same
rate
as
the
the
seven
ships
had
fired
a
total
of
such
objects
away
into
the
blackness
of
earth
shadow
there
were
then
seven
ships
and
masses
of
aluminum
foil
moving
through
emptiness
they
could
not
be
seen
by
telescopes
and
radars
could
not
tell
ships
from
masses
of
aluminum
foil
if
enemy
radars
came
probing
upward
they
reported
space
ships
in
ragged
but
coherent
formation
soaring
through
emptiness
toward
the
platform
and
a
fleet
like
that
was
too
strong
to
attack
the
radar
operators
had
been
prepared
to
forward
details
of
the
speed
and
course
of
a
single
ship
to
waiting
submarines
across
the
pacific
but
they
reported
to
very
high
authority
instead
he
received
the
report
of
an
armada
an
incredible
fleet
in
space
he
did
believe
it
but
he
did
dare
disbelieve
it
so
the
fleet
swam
peacefully
through
the
darkness
that
was
shadow
and
no
attempt
at
attack
was
made
they
came
out
into
sunlight
to
look
down
at
the
western
shore
of
america
itself
with
seven
ships
to
get
on
an
exact
course
at
an
exact
speed
at
an
exact
moment
time
was
needed
so
the
fleet
made
almost
a
complete
circuit
of
the
earth
before
reaching
the
height
of
the
platform
orbit
they
joined
it
a
single
man
in
a
space
suit
anchored
to
its
outer
plates
directed
a
plastic
hose
which
stretched
out
impossibly
far
and
clamped
to
one
drone
with
a
magnetic
grapple
he
maneuvered
it
to
the
hull
and
made
it
fast
he
captured
a
second
which
was
worked
delicately
within
reach
by
coy
puffs
of
vapor
one
by
one
the
drones
were
made
fast
then
the
manned
ship
went
in
the
lock
and
the
great
outer
door
closed
and
the
walls
collapsed
behind
their
nets
and
air
came
in
lieutenant
commander
brown
was
the
one
to
come
into
the
lock
to
greet
them
he
shook
hands
all
around
and
it
again
seemed
strange
to
all
the
four
from
earth
to
find
themselves
with
their
feet
more
or
less
firmly
planted
on
a
solid
floor
but
their
bodies
wavering
erratically
to
right
and
left
and
before
and
back
because
there
was
no
up
or
down
just
had
reports
from
earth
brown
told
joe
comfortably
the
news
of
your
was
released
to
avoid
panic
in
europe
but
everybody
who
does
like
us
is
yelling
blue
murder
somebody
you
may
guess
who
is
announcing
that
a
fleet
of
war
rockets
took
off
from
the
united
states
and
now
hangs
poised
in
space
while
the
decadent
american
prepare
an
ultimatum
to
all
the
world
frightened
if
they
only
stay
scared
until
we
get
unloaded
said
joe
in
some
satisfaction
the
government
back
home
can
tell
them
how
many
we
were
and
what
we
came
up
for
but
we
probably
make
out
all
right
anyhow
my
crew
will
unload
said
brown
in
conscious
thoughtfulness
you
must
have
gotten
pretty
well
exhausted
by
that
acceleration
joe
shook
his
head
i
think
we
can
handle
the
freight
faster
we
found
out
a
few
things
by
going
back
to
earth
a
section
of
plating
at
the
top
of
the
lock
at
least
it
had
been
the
top
when
the
platform
was
built
on
earth
opened
up
as
on
the
first
journey
here
a
face
grinned
down
but
from
this
point
on
the
procedure
was
changed
haney
and
joe
went
into
the
of
the
rocketship
and
heaved
its
contents
smoothly
through
weightlessness
to
the
storage
chamber
above
the
chief
and
mike
stowed
it
there
the
speed
and
precision
of
their
work
was
out
of
all
reason
brown
stared
incredulously
the
fact
was
simply
that
on
their
first
trip
to
the
platform
joe
and
his
crew
did
know
how
to
use
their
strength
where
there
was
no
weight
by
the
time
they
learned
their
muscles
had
lost
all
tone
now
they
were
fresh
from
earth
with
muscles
and
they
knew
how
to
use
them
when
we
got
back
joe
told
brown
we
were
practically
invalids
no
exercise
up
here
this
time
we
brought
some
harness
to
wear
some
for
you
too
they
moved
out
of
the
airlock
and
the
ship
was
maneuvered
to
a
mooring
outside
and
a
drone
took
its
place
brown
eyes
blinked
at
the
unloading
of
the
drone
but
he
said
navy
style
work
that
out
here
said
joe
you
take
no
more
exercise
than
an
invalid
on
earth
in
fact
not
as
much
by
now
the
original
crew
would
have
trouble
standing
up
on
a
trip
back
to
earth
you
feel
pretty
heavy
yourself
brown
frowned
hm
i
ah
i
shall
ask
for
instructions
on
the
matter
he
stood
erect
he
did
waver
on
his
feet
as
the
others
did
but
he
wore
the
same
shoes
joe
knew
with
private
amusement
that
brown
must
have
worked
hard
to
get
a
dignified
stance
in
weightlessness
kenmore
said
brown
suddenly
have
you
been
assigned
a
definite
rank
as
yet
not
that
i
know
of
said
joe
without
interest
i
skipper
the
ship
i
just
brought
up
but
your
ship
has
no
rating
protested
brown
irritably
the
skipper
of
a
navy
ship
may
be
anything
from
a
lieutenant
junior
grade
to
a
captain
depending
on
the
size
and
rating
of
the
ship
in
certain
circumstances
even
a
noncommissioned
officer
are
you
an
enlisted
man
again
not
that
i
know
of
joe
told
him
nor
my
crew
either
brown
looked
at
once
annoyed
and
distressed
it
is
regular
he
objected
it
is
shipshape
i
should
know
whether
you
are
under
my
command
or
not
for
discipline
for
organization
it
should
be
cleared
up
i
shall
put
through
an
urgent
inquiry
joe
looked
at
him
incredulously
lieutenant
commander
brown
was
a
perfectly
amiable
man
but
he
had
to
have
things
in
a
certain
pattern
for
him
to
recognize
that
they
were
in
a
pattern
at
all
he
was
more
excited
over
the
fact
that
he
did
know
whether
he
ranked
joe
than
over
the
much
more
important
matter
of
physical
deterioration
in
the
absence
of
gravity
yet
he
surely
understood
their
relative
importance
the
fact
was
of
course
that
he
could
confidently
expect
exact
instructions
about
the
last
while
he
had
to
settle
matters
of
discipline
and
routine
for
himself
i
shall
ask
for
clarification
of
your
status
he
said
worriedly
it
should
have
been
left
unclear
i
better
attend
to
it
at
once
he
looked
at
joe
as
if
expecting
a
salute
he
did
get
it
he
clanked
away
his
magnetic
beating
out
a
singularly
martial
rhythm
he
must
have
practised
that
walk
in
private
joe
got
out
of
the
airlock
as
another
of
the
space
barges
was
warped
in
brent
the
crew
psychologist
joined
him
when
he
went
to
unload
brent
nodded
in
a
friendly
fashion
to
joe
quite
a
change
eh
he
said
drily
sanford
turned
out
to
be
a
crackpot
with
his
notions
of
grandeur
i
not
sure
that
brown
notions
of
discipline
are
worse
joe
said
i
something
rather
important
to
pass
on
and
told
about
the
newly
discovered
physical
effects
of
a
long
stay
where
there
was
no
gravity
the
doctors
now
predicted
that
anybody
who
spent
six
months
without
weight
would
suffer
a
deterioration
of
muscle
tone
which
could
make
a
return
to
earth
impossible
without
a
long
preliminary
process
of
retraining
one
heart
would
adjust
to
the
absence
of
any
need
to
pump
blood
against
gravity
which
said
joe
means
that
you
going
to
have
to
be
relieved
before
too
long
but
we
brought
up
some
harness
that
may
help
brent
said
desolately
and
i
was
so
pleased
we
all
had
trouble
with
insomnia
at
first
but
lately
we
all
been
sleeping
well
now
i
see
why
normally
one
sleeps
because
he
tired
we
had
trouble
sleeping
until
our
muscles
got
so
weak
we
tired
anyhow
another
drone
came
in
and
was
unloaded
and
another
and
another
but
the
last
of
them
was
only
unloaded
haney
took
over
the
control
board
and
grinning
to
himself
sent
faint
short
wave
impulses
to
the
of
the
drone
the
rockets
were
designed
to
steer
a
loaded
ship
with
the
airlock
door
open
the
silvery
ship
leaped
out
of
the
dock
like
a
frightened
horse
the
rocket
had
a
nearly
empty
hull
to
accelerate
it
responded
skittishly
joe
watched
out
a
port
as
it
went
hurtling
away
the
vast
earth
rolled
beneath
it
it
sped
on
and
vanished
its
fumes
ceased
to
be
visible
joe
told
brent
another
nice
job
that
we
sent
it
backward
slowing
it
a
little
have
a
new
orbit
independent
of
ours
and
below
it
but
come
sixty
hours
it
will
be
directly
underneath
we
haul
it
up
and
refuel
it
and
our
friends
the
enemy
will
hate
it
it
a
radio
repeater
it
pick
up
stuff
beamed
to
it
and
repeat
it
down
to
earth
and
they
can
try
to
jam
that
it
was
a
mildly
malicious
trick
to
play
behind
the
iron
curtain
broadcasts
from
the
free
world
could
be
heard
because
of
stations
built
to
emit
pure
noise
and
drown
them
out
but
the
jamming
stations
were
on
the
enemy
nations
borders
if
radio
programs
came
down
from
overhead
jamming
would
be
ineffective
at
least
in
the
center
of
the
nations
populations
would
hear
the
truth
even
though
their
governments
objected
but
that
was
a
minor
matter
after
all
with
space
ship
hulls
coming
into
being
by
dozens
and
with
one
convoy
of
hundreds
of
tons
of
equipment
gotten
aloft
the
whole
picture
of
supply
for
the
platform
had
changed
part
of
the
new
picture
was
two
devices
that
haney
and
the
chief
were
assembling
they
were
mostly
metal
backbone
and
a
series
of
tanks
with
rocket
motors
mounted
on
ball
and
socket
joints
they
looked
like
huge
red
insects
but
they
were
officially
rocket
recovery
vehicles
and
joe
crew
referred
to
them
as
space
wagons
they
had
no
cabin
but
something
like
a
saddle
before
it
there
was
a
complete
with
and
there
were
racks
to
which
rockets
of
divers
sizes
could
be
attached
they
were
literally
tow
craft
for
travel
in
space
they
had
the
stripped
barren
look
of
farm
machinery
so
the
name
space
wagon
fitted
there
were
two
of
them
we
putting
the
pair
together
the
chief
told
joe
looks
kinda
peculiar
it
only
for
temporary
use
said
joe
there
a
bigger
and
better
one
being
built
with
a
regular
cabin
and
hull
but
some
experience
with
these
two
will
be
useful
in
running
a
regular
space
tug
the
chief
said
with
a
trace
too
much
of
casualness
i
kind
of
looking
forward
to
testing
this
no
said
joe
doggedly
i
responsible
i
take
the
first
chance
but
we
should
all
be
able
to
handle
them
when
this
is
assembled
you
can
stand
by
with
the
second
one
if
the
first
one
works
all
right
try
the
second
the
chief
grimaced
but
he
went
back
to
the
assembly
of
the
spidery
device
joe
got
out
the
harnesses
he
showed
brent
how
they
worked
brown
had
official
instructions
to
order
their
use
but
joe
put
one
on
himself
set
for
full
simulation
he
imitate
actual
gravity
of
course
only
the
effect
of
gravity
on
muscles
there
were
springs
and
elastic
webbing
pulling
one
shoulders
and
feet
together
so
that
it
was
as
much
effort
to
stand
extended
with
one
legs
straight
out
as
to
stand
upright
on
earth
joe
felt
better
with
a
pull
on
his
body
brent
was
upset
when
he
found
that
to
him
more
than
a
tenth
of
normal
gravity
was
unbearable
but
he
kept
it
on
at
that
if
he
increased
the
pull
a
very
little
every
day
he
might
be
able
to
return
to
earth
in
time
now
it
would
be
a
very
dangerous
business
indeed
he
went
off
to
put
the
other
members
of
the
crew
in
the
same
sort
of
harness
after
ten
hours
a
second
drone
broadcaster
went
off
into
space
by
that
time
the
articulated
red
frameworks
were
assembled
they
looked
more
than
ever
like
farm
machinery
save
that
their
bulging
tanks
made
them
look
insectile
too
they
were
actually
something
between
small
and
a
man
in
a
space
suit
could
climb
into
the
saddle
of
one
of
these
creations
plug
in
the
of
his
suit
to
the
tanks
and
travel
in
space
by
means
of
the
space
wagon
rockets
these
weird
vehicles
had
remarkably
powerful
magnetic
grapples
they
were
equipped
with
steering
rockets
as
powerful
as
those
of
a
ship
they
had
banks
of
rockets
of
divers
power
and
length
of
burning
and
they
even
mounted
rocket
missiles
small
guided
rockets
which
could
be
used
to
destroy
what
could
not
be
recovered
they
were
intended
to
handle
unmanned
rocket
shipments
of
supplies
to
the
platform
there
were
reasons
why
the
trick
should
be
economical
if
it
should
happen
to
work
at
all
when
they
were
ready
for
testing
they
seemed
very
small
in
the
great
space
lock
joe
and
the
chief
very
carefully
checked
an
extremely
long
list
of
things
that
had
to
work
right
or
nothing
would
work
at
all
that
part
of
the
job
was
thrilling
but
joe
no
longer
looked
for
thrills
he
painstakingly
did
the
things
that
produced
results
if
a
sense
of
adventure
seemed
to
disappear
the
sensations
of
achievement
more
than
made
up
for
it
they
got
into
space
suits
they
were
in
an
odd
position
on
the
platform
lieutenant
commander
brown
had
avoided
joe
as
much
as
possible
since
his
arrival
so
far
he
carefully
avoided
giving
him
direct
orders
because
joe
was
not
certainly
and
officially
his
subordinate
lacking
exact
information
the
only
thing
a
conscientious
naval
officer
could
do
was
exercise
the
maximum
of
tact
and
insistently
ask
authority
for
a
ruling
on
joe
place
in
the
hierarchy
of
rank
joe
flung
a
leg
over
his
eccentric
mount
he
clipped
his
plugged
in
his
suit
to
the
space
wagon
tanks
and
spoke
into
his
helmet
transmitter
okay
to
open
the
lock
chief
you
keep
watch
if
i
make
out
all
right
you
can
join
me
if
i
get
in
serious
trouble
come
after
me
in
the
ship
we
rode
up
but
only
if
it
practical
not
otherwise
the
chief
said
something
in
mohawk
he
sounded
indignant
the
plastic
walls
of
the
lock
swelled
inward
burying
and
overwhelming
them
pumps
pounded
briefly
removing
what
air
was
left
then
the
walls
drew
back
straining
against
their
netting
and
joe
waited
for
the
door
to
open
to
empty
space
instead
there
came
a
sharp
voice
in
his
it
was
brown
says
there
a
rocket
on
the
way
up
it
over
at
what
is
the
edge
of
the
world
from
here
three
gravities
only
better
not
go
out
joe
hesitated
brown
still
issued
no
order
but
defense
against
a
single
rocket
would
be
a
matter
of
guided
missiles
brown
business
if
the
tin
can
screen
did
handle
it
joe
would
have
no
part
in
it
he
would
be
needed
he
could
help
and
there
be
all
the
elaborate
business
of
checking
to
go
through
again
he
said
uncomfortably
it
be
a
long
time
before
it
gets
here
and
three
gravities
is
low
maybe
it
a
defective
job
there
have
been
misfires
and
so
on
it
take
long
to
try
this
wagon
anyhow
they
anxious
to
send
up
a
robot
ship
from
the
shed
and
these
have
to
be
tested
first
give
me
ten
minutes
he
heard
the
chief
grumbling
to
himself
but
one
tested
space
wagon
was
better
than
none
the
airlock
doors
opened
huge
round
valves
swung
wide
bright
remote
swarming
stars
filled
the
opening
joe
cracked
the
control
of
his
forward
rockets
the
lock
filled
instantly
with
swirling
fumes
and
instantly
the
tiny
space
wagon
moved
it
did
not
have
to
lift
from
the
lock
floor
once
the
magnetic
clamps
were
released
it
was
free
of
the
floor
but
it
did
have
mass
one
brief
push
of
the
rockets
sent
it
floating
out
of
the
lock
it
was
in
space
it
kept
on
joe
felt
a
peculiar
twinge
of
panic
nobody
who
is
accustomed
only
to
earth
can
quite
realize
at
the
beginning
the
conditions
of
handling
vehicles
in
space
but
joe
cracked
the
braking
rockets
he
stopped
he
hung
seemingly
motionless
in
space
the
platform
was
a
good
away
he
tried
the
gyros
and
the
space
wagon
went
into
swift
spinning
he
reversed
them
and
straightened
out
almost
the
vastness
of
all
creation
seemed
still
to
revolve
slowly
about
him
the
monstrous
globe
which
was
earth
moved
sedately
from
above
his
head
to
under
his
feet
and
continued
the
slow
revolution
the
platform
rotated
in
a
clockwise
direction
he
was
drifting
very
slowly
away
chief
he
said
wrily
you
ca
do
worse
than
i
doing
and
rushed
for
time
you
might
come
out
but
listen
you
do
run
your
rockets
on
earth
you
keep
a
motor
going
because
when
it
stops
you
do
but
out
here
you
have
to
use
your
motor
to
stop
but
not
to
keep
on
going
get
it
when
you
do
come
out
do
burn
your
rockets
more
than
half
a
second
at
a
time
the
chief
voice
came
booming
joe
here
i
come
there
was
a
billowing
of
frantically
writhing
fumes
which
darted
madly
in
every
direction
until
they
ceased
to
be
the
chief
in
his
contraption
came
bolting
out
of
the
hole
which
was
the
airlock
he
was
a
good
away
the
rocket
fumes
ceased
he
kept
on
going
joe
heard
him
swear
the
chief
felt
the
utterly
helpless
sensation
of
a
man
in
a
car
when
his
brakes
do
work
but
a
moment
later
the
braking
rockets
did
flare
briefly
yet
still
too
long
the
chief
was
not
only
stopped
but
drifting
backwards
toward
the
platform
he
evidently
tried
to
turn
and
he
spun
as
dizzily
as
joe
had
done
but
after
a
moment
he
stopped
almost
there
were
then
two
things
in
space
somewhat
like
giant
floating
forlornly
in
emptiness
they
seemed
very
remote
from
the
great
bright
steel
platform
and
that
gigantic
ball
which
was
earth
turning
very
slowly
and
filling
a
good
fourth
of
all
that
could
be
seen
suppose
you
head
toward
me
chief
said
joe
absorbedly
aim
to
pass
and
remember
that
what
you
have
to
estimate
is
not
where
i
am
but
where
you
have
to
put
on
the
brakes
to
stop
close
by
that
where
you
use
your
the
chief
tried
it
he
came
to
a
stop
a
past
joe
said
his
voice
disgustedly
i
try
to
join
you
said
joe
he
did
try
he
stopped
a
little
short
the
two
weird
objects
drifted
almost
together
the
chief
was
upside
down
with
regard
to
joe
presently
he
was
sidewise
on
this
takes
thinking
said
joe
ruefully
a
voice
in
his
headphones
from
the
platform
said
rocket
from
earth
is
still
accelerating
still
at
three
gravities
it
looks
like
it
is
defective
it
might
be
carrying
a
man
had
you
better
come
in
the
chief
growled
wo
be
any
safer
there
i
want
to
get
the
hang
of
then
his
voice
changed
sharply
get
that
joe
heard
his
own
voice
very
cold
i
did
i
do
now
brown
i
suggest
a
guided
missile
at
that
rocket
coming
up
if
there
a
man
in
it
he
coming
up
to
take
over
guided
missiles
that
overtake
him
and
try
to
smash
the
platform
by
direct
control
since
proximity
fuses
do
work
i
smash
him
as
far
away
as
possible
brown
voice
came
very
curt
and
worried
there
was
an
eruption
of
rocket
fumes
from
the
side
of
the
platform
something
went
foaming
away
toward
earth
it
dwindled
with
incredible
rapidity
then
joe
said
chief
i
think
we
better
go
down
and
meet
that
rocket
we
learn
to
handle
these
wagons
on
the
way
i
think
we
going
to
have
a
fight
on
our
hands
whoever
in
that
rocket
is
coming
up
just
to
shake
hands
with
us
he
steadied
the
small
red
vehicle
and
pointed
it
for
earth
he
added
i
firing
a
job
chief
counting
three
three
two
one
his
mount
vanished
in
rocket
fumes
but
after
six
seconds
at
two
gravities
acceleration
the
rocket
burned
out
the
chief
had
fired
a
matching
rocket
they
were
miles
apart
but
speeding
earthward
on
very
nearly
identical
courses
the
platform
grew
smaller
that
was
their
only
proof
of
motion
a
very
very
long
time
passed
the
chief
fired
his
steering
rockets
to
bring
him
closer
to
joe
it
did
not
work
he
had
to
aim
for
joe
and
fire
a
blast
to
move
noticeably
nearer
presently
he
would
have
to
blast
again
to
keep
from
passing
joe
made
calculations
in
his
head
he
worried
he
and
the
chief
were
speeding
earthward
away
from
the
platform
at
more
than
four
miles
a
minute
but
it
was
not
enough
the
manned
rocket
was
accelerating
at
a
great
deal
more
than
that
rate
and
if
the
platform
enemies
down
on
earth
had
sent
a
manned
rocket
up
to
destroy
the
platform
the
man
in
it
would
have
ways
of
defending
himself
he
would
expect
guided
missiles
but
he
probably
would
expect
to
be
attacked
by
space
wagons
joe
said
suddenly
chief
i
going
to
burn
a
we
got
to
match
velocities
coming
back
join
me
three
two
one
he
fired
a
twelve
seconds
burning
two
gravities
acceleration
it
built
up
his
speed
away
from
the
platform
to
a
rate
which
would
have
been
breathless
on
earth
but
here
there
was
no
sensation
of
motion
and
the
distances
were
enormous
things
which
happen
in
space
happen
with
insensate
violence
and
incredible
swiftness
but
long
long
long
intervals
elapse
between
events
the
rocket
burned
out
the
chief
had
matched
that
also
brown
voice
in
the
headphones
said
rocket
cut
acceleration
it
floating
up
now
it
should
reach
our
orbit
fifty
miles
behind
us
but
our
missile
should
hit
it
in
forty
i
would
bet
on
that
said
joe
coldly
figure
interception
data
for
the
chief
and
me
make
it
fast
he
spotted
the
chief
a
dozen
miles
away
and
burning
his
steering
rockets
to
close
again
the
chief
had
the
hang
of
it
now
he
try
to
steer
he
drove
toward
joe
but
nothing
happened
and
nothing
happened
and
nothing
happened
the
two
tiny
space
wagons
were
miles
from
the
platform
which
was
now
merely
a
glittering
speck
hardly
brighter
than
the
brightest
stars
there
was
a
flare
of
light
to
earthward
it
was
brighter
than
the
sun
the
light
vanished
brown
voice
came
in
the
headphones
missile
went
off
miles
short
he
sent
an
interceptor
to
set
it
off
then
he
dangerous
said
joe
there
be
war
rockets
coming
up
any
second
now
for
him
to
control
from
right
at
hand
we
wo
be
fighting
rockets
controlled
from
miles
away
they
found
proximity
fuses
do
work
so
he
going
to
work
in
close
give
us
our
course
and
data
quick
the
chief
and
i
have
got
to
try
to
smash
things
the
two
tiny
space
wagons
like
in
form
absurdly
painted
a
brilliant
red
seemed
inordinately
lonely
it
was
hardly
possible
to
pick
out
the
platform
with
the
naked
eyes
the
earth
was
thousands
of
miles
below
joe
and
the
chief
in
space
suits
rode
tiny
metal
frameworks
in
an
emptiness
more
vast
more
lonely
more
terrible
than
either
could
have
imagined
then
the
war
rockets
started
up
there
were
eight
of
them
they
came
out
to
do
murder
at
ten
gravities
acceleration
but
even
at
ten
gravities
drive
it
takes
time
to
travel
miles
at
three
and
coasting
a
great
deal
of
the
way
it
takes
much
longer
the
platform
circled
earth
in
four
hours
and
a
little
more
anything
intending
interception
and
rising
straight
up
needed
to
start
skyward
long
before
the
platform
was
overhead
a
rocket
would
start
while
the
platform
was
still
below
the
western
horizon
from
its
especially
if
it
planned
to
coast
part
of
its
journey
and
a
rocket
would
have
to
coast
most
of
the
way
so
there
was
time
coasting
the
rising
manned
rocket
would
be
losing
speed
if
it
planned
to
go
no
higher
than
the
platform
orbit
its
upward
velocity
would
be
zero
there
if
it
were
intercepted
miles
down
it
would
be
rising
at
an
almost
leisurely
rate
and
joe
and
the
chief
could
check
their
earthward
plunge
and
match
its
rising
rate
this
they
did
but
what
they
could
do
was
match
its
orbital
velocity
which
was
zero
they
had
the
platform
eastward
speed
to
start
with
over
miles
a
minute
no
matter
how
desperately
they
fired
they
could
stop
and
maneuver
around
the
rising
inevitably
they
would
simply
flash
past
it
in
the
fraction
of
an
instant
to
fire
their
tiny
guided
missiles
on
ahead
would
be
almost
to
assure
that
they
would
miss
also
the
enemy
ship
was
manned
it
could
fight
back
but
joe
had
been
on
the
receiving
end
of
one
attack
in
space
it
much
experience
but
it
was
more
than
anybody
but
he
and
his
own
crew
possessed
chief
said
joe
softly
into
his
as
if
by
speaking
softly
he
could
keep
from
being
overheard
get
close
enough
to
me
to
see
what
i
do
and
do
it
too
i
ca
tell
you
more
whoever
running
this
rocket
might
know
english
there
was
a
flaring
of
vapor
in
space
the
chief
was
using
his
to
draw
near
joe
spun
his
little
space
wagon
about
so
that
it
pointed
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
he
had
four
guided
missiles
demolition
type
very
deliberately
he
fired
the
four
of
them
astern
away
from
the
rising
rocket
they
were
relatively
missiles
intended
to
blow
up
a
robot
ship
that
could
be
hooked
onto
because
it
was
traveling
too
much
faster
or
slower
than
the
platform
it
was
intended
to
reach
the
missiles
went
away
then
joe
faced
about
again
in
the
direction
of
his
prospective
target
the
chief
fumed
joe
heard
him
but
he
duplicated
joe
maneuver
he
faced
his
own
eccentric
vessel
in
the
direction
of
its
line
of
flight
then
his
fuming
suddenly
ceased
joe
headphones
brought
his
explosive
grunt
when
he
suddenly
saw
the
idea
i
wish
you
could
talk
indian
i
could
kiss
you
for
this
trick
brown
voice
said
anxiously
going
to
let
that
manned
rocket
have
a
couple
more
let
us
get
by
first
said
joe
then
maybe
you
can
use
them
on
the
bombs
coming
up
he
could
see
the
trails
of
on
the
way
out
from
earth
they
were
infinitesimal
threads
of
vapor
they
were
the
thinnest
possible
filaments
of
gossamer
white
but
they
enlarged
as
they
rose
they
were
climbing
at
better
than
two
miles
per
second
now
and
still
increasing
their
speed
but
the
arena
in
which
this
conflict
took
place
was
so
vast
that
everything
seemed
to
take
place
in
slow
motion
there
was
time
to
reason
out
not
only
the
method
of
attack
from
earth
but
the
excuse
for
it
if
the
platform
vanished
from
space
no
matter
from
what
cause
its
enemies
would
announce
vociferously
that
it
had
been
destroyed
by
its
own
atomic
bombs
exploding
spontaneously
even
in
the
face
of
proof
of
murder
enemy
nations
would
stridently
insist
that
bombs
intended
for
the
enslavement
of
humanity
in
the
platform
had
providentially
detonated
and
removed
that
instrument
of
scoundrelly
imperialists
from
the
skies
there
might
be
somebody
somewhere
who
would
believe
it
joe
and
the
chief
were
steadied
now
nearly
on
a
line
to
intercept
the
rising
manned
rocket
they
had
already
fired
their
missiles
which
trailed
them
they
went
into
battle
not
prepared
to
shoot
but
with
their
ammunition
expended
for
which
there
was
excellent
reason
something
came
foaming
toward
them
from
the
nearby
rocket
it
seemed
like
a
from
the
column
of
vapor
rising
from
earth
actually
it
was
a
guided
missile
now
we
dodge
said
joe
cheerfully
remember
the
trick
of
this
maneuvering
business
it
was
simple
speeding
toward
the
rising
assassin
and
with
his
missiles
rushing
toward
them
the
relative
speeds
of
the
wagons
and
the
missiles
were
added
together
if
the
space
wagons
dodged
the
missile
operator
had
less
time
to
swing
his
guided
rockets
to
match
the
change
of
target
course
and
besides
the
attacker
had
made
a
single
turn
in
space
not
yet
he
might
know
that
a
rocket
does
go
where
pointed
as
a
matter
of
theory
he
might
even
know
intellectually
that
the
final
speed
and
course
of
a
rocket
is
the
sum
of
all
its
previous
speeds
and
courses
but
he
had
used
the
knowledge
joe
and
the
chief
had
something
rushed
at
them
they
went
into
evasive
action
and
they
merely
turn
the
noses
of
their
space
wagons
they
flung
them
about
and
blasted
they
used
wholly
different
accelerations
at
odd
angles
joe
shot
away
from
earth
on
steering
rocket
thrust
and
touched
off
a
while
he
faced
toward
earth
north
pole
and
halfway
along
that
rush
he
flipped
his
craft
in
a
somersault
and
the
result
was
nearly
a
turn
when
the
burned
out
he
set
off
a
and
halfway
through
its
burning
fired
a
with
it
so
that
at
the
beginning
he
had
two
gravities
acceleration
then
four
gravities
for
three
seconds
and
then
two
again
with
long
practice
a
man
might
learn
marksmanship
in
space
but
all
a
man
judgment
of
speeds
is
learned
on
earth
where
things
always
always
always
move
steadily
nobody
making
his
first
could
possibly
hit
such
targets
as
joe
and
the
chief
made
of
themselves
the
man
in
the
enemy
rocket
was
making
his
first
flight
also
joe
and
the
chief
had
an
initial
velocity
of
miles
a
minute
toward
him
the
marksman
in
the
rising
rocket
had
a
chance
he
fired
four
more
missiles
and
tried
desperately
to
home
them
in
but
they
flashed
past
his
rising
course
and
then
they
were
quite
safe
from
his
fire
because
it
would
take
a
very
long
time
indeed
for
anything
he
shot
after
them
to
catch
up
but
their
missiles
had
still
to
pass
him
and
joe
and
the
chief
could
steer
them
without
any
concern
about
their
own
safety
or
anything
else
but
a
hit
they
made
a
hit
two
of
the
eight
little
missiles
flashed
luridly
almost
together
where
the
showed
the
rocket
to
be
then
there
were
two
parts
to
the
rocket
separating
one
was
small
and
one
was
fairly
large
another
hit
the
larger
section
still
another
exploded
as
that
was
going
to
pieces
the
smaller
fragment
ceased
to
be
important
the
explosions
were
atomic
bombs
of
course
they
were
only
but
they
demolished
the
manned
rocket
admirably
brown
voice
came
in
the
headphones
still
tense
got
it
how
about
the
others
joe
felt
a
remarkable
exhilaration
later
he
might
think
about
the
poor
devil
there
could
have
been
only
one
who
had
been
destroyed
some
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
he
might
think
unhappily
of
that
man
as
a
victim
of
hatred
rather
than
as
a
hater
he
might
become
extremely
uncomfortable
about
this
but
at
the
moment
he
felt
merely
that
he
and
the
chief
had
won
a
startling
victory
i
think
he
said
that
you
can
treat
them
with
silent
contempt
they
wo
have
proximity
fuses
those
friends
of
ours
who
want
so
badly
to
kill
us
have
found
that
proximity
fuses
do
work
unless
one
is
on
a
collision
course
i
do
think
you
need
to
do
anything
about
them
the
chief
was
muttering
to
himself
in
mohawk
twenty
miles
away
joe
said
chief
how
about
getting
back
to
the
platform
the
chief
growled
would
disown
me
winning
a
fight
and
no
scalp
to
show
not
even
counting
coup
he
disown
me
but
joe
saw
his
rockets
flare
away
off
against
the
stars
the
war
rockets
were
very
near
now
they
still
emitted
monstrous
jettings
of
thick
white
vapor
they
climbed
up
with
incredible
speed
one
went
by
joe
at
a
distance
of
little
more
than
a
mile
and
its
fumes
eddied
out
to
half
that
before
they
thinned
to
nothingness
they
went
on
and
on
and
on
they
burned
out
somewhere
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
they
fell
back
to
earth
hours
probably
then
they
would
be
meteors
they
vaporize
before
they
touched
solidity
they
would
even
explode
but
joe
and
the
chief
rode
back
to
the
platform
it
was
surprising
how
hard
it
was
to
match
speed
with
it
again
to
make
a
good
entrance
into
the
giant
lock
they
barely
made
it
before
the
platform
made
its
plunge
into
that
horrible
blackness
which
was
the
earth
shadow
and
joe
was
very
glad
they
did
make
it
before
then
he
would
have
liked
to
be
merely
astride
a
skinny
framework
in
that
ghastly
darkness
with
the
monstrous
blackness
of
the
abyss
seeming
to
be
trying
to
devour
him
haney
met
them
in
the
airlock
he
grinned
nice
job
joe
nice
job
chief
he
said
warmly
uh
the
lieutenant
commander
wants
you
to
report
to
him
joe
right
away
joe
cocked
an
eyebrow
at
him
what
for
haney
spread
out
his
hands
the
chief
grunted
that
guy
bothers
me
i
bet
joe
he
going
to
explain
you
gone
out
when
he
did
want
you
to
me
i
keeping
away
from
him
the
chief
shed
his
space
suit
and
swaggered
away
as
well
as
anyone
could
swagger
while
walking
on
what
happened
to
be
the
ceiling
from
joe
point
of
view
joe
put
his
space
gear
in
its
proper
place
he
went
to
the
small
cubbyhole
that
brown
had
appropriated
for
the
office
of
the
platform
commander
joe
went
in
naturally
without
saluting
brown
sat
in
a
chair
with
thigh
grips
holding
him
in
place
he
was
writing
on
joe
entry
he
carefully
put
the
pen
down
on
a
magnetized
plate
that
would
hold
it
until
he
wanted
it
again
otherwise
it
could
have
floated
anywhere
about
the
room
kenmore
said
brown
awkwardly
you
did
a
very
nice
piece
of
work
it
too
bad
you
are
in
the
navy
joe
said
it
did
work
out
pretty
fortunately
it
lucky
the
chief
and
i
were
out
practicing
but
now
we
can
take
off
when
a
rocket
reported
any
time
brown
cleared
his
throat
i
can
thank
you
personally
he
said
unhappily
and
i
do
but
really
this
situation
is
intolerable
how
can
i
report
this
affair
i
ca
suggest
commendation
or
a
promotion
or
anything
i
do
even
know
how
to
refer
to
you
i
am
going
to
ask
you
kenmore
to
put
through
a
request
that
your
status
be
clarified
i
would
imagine
that
your
status
would
mean
a
rank
hm
about
equivalent
to
a
lieutenant
junior
grade
in
the
navy
joe
grinned
i
have
ah
prepared
a
draft
you
might
find
helpful
said
brown
earnestly
it
necessary
for
something
to
be
done
it
urgent
important
sorry
said
joe
the
important
thing
to
me
is
getting
ready
to
load
up
the
platform
with
supplies
from
earth
excuse
me
he
went
out
of
the
office
he
made
his
way
to
the
quarters
assigned
himself
and
his
crew
mike
greeted
him
with
reproachful
eyes
joe
waved
his
hand
do
say
it
mike
the
answer
is
yes
see
that
the
tanks
are
refilled
and
new
rockets
put
in
place
then
you
and
haney
go
out
and
practice
but
no
farther
than
ten
miles
from
the
platform
understand
no
said
mike
rebelliously
it
a
dirty
trick
which
joe
assured
him
i
commit
only
because
there
a
robot
ship
from
bootstrap
coming
up
any
time
now
and
we
need
to
pick
it
up
and
tow
it
here
he
went
to
the
to
see
if
he
could
get
a
vision
connection
to
earth
he
got
the
beam
and
he
got
sally
on
the
screen
a
report
of
the
attack
on
the
platform
had
evidently
already
gone
down
to
earth
expression
was
somehow
drawn
and
haunted
but
she
tried
to
talk
lightly
and
stuff
joe
she
asked
how
does
it
feel
to
be
a
victorious
warrior
it
feels
rotten
he
told
her
there
must
have
been
somebody
in
the
rocket
we
blew
up
he
felt
like
a
patriot
i
guess
trying
to
murder
us
but
i
feel
like
a
butcher
maybe
you
did
do
it
she
said
maybe
the
chief
bombs
maybe
said
joe
he
hesitated
hold
up
your
hand
she
held
it
up
his
ring
was
still
on
it
she
nodded
still
there
when
will
you
be
back
he
shook
his
head
he
did
know
it
was
curious
that
one
wanted
so
badly
to
talk
to
a
girl
after
doing
something
that
was
and
left
one
rather
sickish
afterward
this
business
of
space
travel
and
even
space
battle
was
what
he
dreamed
of
and
he
still
wanted
it
but
it
was
very
comforting
to
talk
to
sally
who
had
to
go
through
any
of
it
write
me
a
letter
will
you
he
asked
we
ca
tie
up
this
beam
very
long
i
write
you
all
the
news
that
allowed
to
go
out
she
assured
him
be
seeing
you
joe
her
image
faded
from
the
screen
and
thinking
it
over
he
could
see
that
either
of
them
had
said
anything
of
any
importance
at
all
but
he
was
very
glad
they
talked
together
the
first
robot
ship
came
up
some
eight
hours
later
two
revolutions
after
the
television
call
mike
was
ready
hours
in
advance
fidgeting
the
robot
ship
started
up
while
the
platform
was
over
the
middle
of
the
pacific
it
did
try
to
make
a
spiral
approach
as
all
other
ships
had
done
it
came
straight
up
and
it
started
from
the
ground
no
pushpots
its
rockets
were
monsters
they
pushed
upward
at
ten
gravities
until
it
was
out
of
atmosphere
and
then
they
stepped
up
to
fifteen
much
later
the
robot
turned
on
its
side
and
fired
orbital
speed
rockets
to
match
velocity
with
the
platform
there
were
two
reasons
for
the
vertical
rise
and
the
high
acceleration
if
a
robot
ship
went
straight
up
it
would
pass
over
enemy
territory
until
it
was
high
enough
to
be
protected
by
the
platform
and
it
costs
fuel
to
carry
fuel
to
be
burned
so
if
the
rocketship
could
get
up
speed
for
coasting
to
orbit
in
the
first
couple
of
hundred
miles
it
haul
its
fuel
so
far
it
was
economical
to
burn
one
fuel
fast
and
get
an
acceleration
that
would
kill
a
human
crew
hence
robots
the
landing
of
the
first
robot
ship
at
the
platform
was
almost
as
as
if
it
had
been
done
a
thousand
times
before
from
the
platform
its
dramatic
could
be
seen
of
course
it
first
appeared
aloft
as
a
pip
on
a
radar
screen
then
mike
prepared
to
go
out
and
hook
on
to
it
and
tow
it
in
he
was
in
his
space
suit
and
in
the
landing
lock
though
his
helmet
faceplate
was
still
open
a
loudspeaker
boomed
suddenly
in
brown
voice
airlock
and
prepare
to
take
off
joe
roared
hold
that
brown
voice
very
official
came
execution
of
that
order
you
should
not
be
in
the
airlock
kenmore
you
will
please
make
way
for
operational
we
checking
the
space
wagon
snapped
joe
that
operational
procedure
the
loudspeaker
said
severely
checking
should
have
been
done
earlier
there
was
silence
mike
and
joe
together
painstakingly
checked
over
the
very
many
items
that
had
to
be
made
sure
every
rocket
had
to
have
its
firing
circuit
inspected
the
tanks
contents
and
pressure
verified
the
air
connection
to
mike
space
suit
the
air
pressure
the
device
that
made
sure
that
air
going
to
mike
space
suit
was
neither
as
hot
as
metal
in
burning
sunlight
nor
cold
as
the
chill
of
a
shadow
in
space
everything
checked
mike
straddled
his
mount
joe
left
the
lock
and
said
curtly
okay
to
pump
the
airlock
okay
to
open
airlock
doors
when
ready
go
ahead
mike
went
out
and
joe
watched
from
a
port
in
the
platform
hull
the
drone
from
earth
was
five
miles
behind
the
platform
in
its
orbit
and
twenty
miles
below
and
all
of
ten
miles
joe
saw
mike
scoot
the
red
space
wagon
to
it
stop
short
with
a
sort
of
cocky
hook
on
to
the
in
the
floating
nose
and
blast
off
back
toward
the
platform
with
it
in
tow
mike
had
to
turn
about
and
blast
again
to
check
his
motion
when
he
arrived
and
then
he
and
haney
haney
in
the
other
space
wagon
nudged
at
it
and
tugged
at
it
and
got
it
in
the
great
spacelock
they
went
in
after
it
and
the
lock
doors
closed
neither
mike
nor
haney
were
out
of
their
space
suits
when
kent
brought
joe
a
note
a
note
was
an
absurdity
in
the
platform
but
this
was
a
formal
communication
from
brown
comdr
brown
to
kenmore
subject
cooperation
and
courtesy
in
rocket
recovery
vehicle
launchings
there
is
a
regrettable
lack
of
coordination
and
courtesy
in
the
launching
of
vehicles
space
wagons
in
the
normal
operation
of
the
platform
the
maintenance
of
discipline
and
efficiency
requires
that
the
commanding
officer
maintain
overall
control
of
all
operations
at
all
times
hereafter
when
a
space
vehicle
of
any
type
is
to
be
launched
the
commanding
officer
will
be
notified
in
writing
not
less
than
one
hour
before
such
launching
the
time
of
such
proposed
launching
will
be
given
in
such
notification
in
hours
and
minutes
and
seconds
greenwich
mean
time
all
commands
for
launching
will
be
given
by
the
commanding
officer
or
an
officer
designated
by
joe
received
the
memo
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
writing
a
painstaking
report
on
the
maneuver
mike
had
carried
out
mike
was
radiant
as
he
discussed
possible
improvements
with
later
and
better
equipment
after
all
this
had
been
a
lucky
landing
for
a
robot
to
end
up
no
more
than
miles
from
its
target
after
a
journey
of
miles
and
with
a
difference
in
velocity
that
was
almost
immeasurable
such
good
fortune
could
be
expected
as
a
regular
thing
the
space
wagons
were
tiny
if
they
had
to
travel
long
distances
to
recover
erratic
ships
coming
up
from
earth
joe
forgot
all
about
lieutenant
commander
brown
and
his
memo
when
the
mail
was
distributed
joe
had
three
letters
from
sally
he
read
them
in
the
great
living
compartment
of
the
platform
with
its
length
and
its
carpet
on
floor
and
ceiling
and
the
galleries
without
stairs
outside
the
sleeping
cabins
he
sat
in
a
chair
with
thigh
grips
to
hold
him
in
place
and
he
wore
a
gravity
simulation
harness
it
was
necessary
the
regular
crew
of
the
platform
by
this
time
could
have
handled
space
wagons
in
action
against
enemy
manned
rockets
joe
meant
to
stay
able
to
take
acceleration
it
was
just
as
he
finished
his
mail
that
brent
came
in
big
news
said
brent
they
building
a
big
new
ship
of
new
design
almost
half
as
big
as
the
platform
with
concreted
metal
they
can
do
it
in
weeks
what
it
for
demanded
joe
it
be
a
human
base
on
the
moon
said
brent
relievedly
an
expedition
will
start
in
six
weeks
according
to
plan
as
long
as
the
only
american
base
in
space
we
going
to
be
shot
at
but
a
base
on
the
moon
will
be
invulnerable
so
they
going
ahead
with
it
joe
said
hopefully
any
orders
for
me
to
join
it
brent
shook
his
head
we
to
be
loaded
up
with
supplies
for
the
moon
expedition
we
to
be
ready
to
take
a
robot
ship
every
round
actually
they
ca
hope
to
send
us
more
than
two
a
day
for
a
while
but
even
that
be
eighty
tons
of
supplies
to
be
stored
away
the
chief
grumbled
but
somehow
his
grumbling
did
not
sound
genuine
they
going
to
the
moon
and
leave
us
here
to
do
stevedore
stuff
his
tone
was
odd
he
looked
at
a
letter
he
been
reading
and
gave
up
pretense
he
said
listen
you
guys
my
tribe
got
all
excited
i
just
got
a
letter
from
the
council
they
been
having
an
argument
about
me
wan
na
hear
he
was
a
little
amused
and
a
little
embarrassed
but
something
had
happened
to
make
him
feel
good
let
have
it
said
joe
mike
was
very
still
in
another
chair
he
did
look
up
though
he
must
have
heard
haney
cocked
an
interested
ear
the
chief
said
awkwardly
you
know
us
mohawks
are
kinda
proud
we
got
something
to
be
proud
of
we
were
one
of
the
five
nations
when
that
was
a
sort
of
united
nations
and
all
europe
was
my
tribe
had
a
big
about
me
there
a
tribe
member
that
a
professor
of
anthropology
out
in
chicago
he
was
there
and
a
couple
of
guys
that
do
electronic
research
and
doctors
and
farmers
and
all
sorts
of
guys
all
mohawks
they
got
together
in
tribal
council
he
stopped
and
flushed
under
his
dark
skin
i
would
tell
you
only
you
guys
are
in
on
it
still
he
hesitated
joe
found
a
curious
picture
forming
in
his
mind
he
known
the
chief
a
long
time
and
he
knew
that
part
of
the
tribe
lived
in
brooklyn
and
individual
members
were
widely
scattered
but
still
there
was
a
certain
remote
village
which
to
all
the
tribesmen
was
home
everybody
went
back
there
from
time
to
time
to
rest
from
the
strangeness
of
being
indians
in
a
world
of
folk
joe
could
almost
imagine
the
council
there
be
old
old
men
who
could
nearly
remember
the
days
of
the
tribe
former
glory
who
heard
stories
of
forest
warfare
and
zestful
hunts
and
scalpings
and
heroic
deeds
from
their
grandfathers
but
there
were
also
doctors
and
lawyers
and
technical
men
in
that
council
which
met
to
talk
about
the
chief
it
addressed
to
me
said
the
chief
with
sudden
clumsiness
in
the
canoe
that
the
platform
here
and
it
says
i
have
to
translate
because
it
in
mohawk
he
took
a
deep
breath
it
says
your
tribesmen
have
heard
of
your
journeyings
off
the
earth
where
men
have
never
traveled
before
this
has
given
us
great
pride
that
one
of
our
tribe
and
kin
had
ventured
so
valiantly
the
chief
grinned
abashedly
he
went
on
full
assembly
the
elders
of
the
tribe
have
held
counsel
on
a
way
to
express
their
pride
in
you
and
in
the
friends
you
have
made
who
accompanied
you
it
was
proposed
that
you
be
given
a
new
name
to
be
borne
by
your
sons
after
you
it
was
proposed
that
the
tribe
accept
from
each
of
its
members
a
gift
to
be
given
you
in
the
name
of
the
tribe
but
these
were
not
considered
great
enough
therefore
the
tribe
in
full
council
has
decreed
that
your
name
shall
be
named
at
every
tribal
council
of
the
mohawks
from
this
day
to
the
end
of
time
as
one
the
young
braves
would
do
well
to
copy
in
all
ways
and
the
names
of
your
friends
joe
kenmore
mike
scandia
and
thomas
haney
shall
also
be
named
as
friends
whose
like
all
young
braves
should
strive
to
seek
out
and
to
be
the
chief
sweated
a
little
but
he
looked
enormously
proud
joe
went
over
to
him
and
shook
hands
warmly
the
chief
almost
broke
his
fingers
it
was
of
course
as
high
an
honor
as
could
be
paid
to
anybody
by
the
people
who
paid
it
haney
said
awkwardly
lucky
they
do
know
me
like
you
do
chief
but
it
swell
which
it
was
but
mike
had
said
a
word
the
chief
said
exuberantly
did
you
hear
that
mike
every
mohawk
for
ten
thousand
years
is
gon
na
be
told
that
you
were
a
swell
guy
crazy
huh
mike
said
in
an
odd
voice
yeah
i
did
mean
that
chief
it
fine
but
i
i
got
a
letter
i
never
thought
to
get
a
letter
like
this
he
looked
unbelievingly
at
the
paper
in
his
hands
mash
note
asked
the
chief
his
tone
was
a
little
bit
harsh
mike
was
a
midget
and
there
were
women
who
were
fools
it
would
be
unbearable
if
some
female
had
written
mike
the
sort
of
gushing
letter
that
some
females
might
write
mike
shook
his
head
with
an
odd
quick
smile
not
what
you
think
chief
but
it
is
from
a
girl
she
sent
me
her
picture
it
a
swell
letter
i
going
to
answer
it
you
can
look
at
her
picture
she
looks
kind
of
nice
he
handed
the
chief
a
snapshot
the
chief
face
changed
haney
looked
over
his
shoulder
he
passed
the
picture
to
joe
and
said
ferociously
you
mike
you
doggoned
don
juan
the
chief
and
me
have
got
to
warn
her
what
kinda
guy
you
are
stealing
from
blind
men
fighting
cops
joe
looked
at
the
picture
it
was
a
very
sweet
small
face
and
the
eyes
that
looked
out
of
the
photograph
were
very
honest
and
yearning
and
joe
understood
he
grinned
at
mike
because
this
girl
had
the
distinctive
look
that
mike
had
she
was
a
midget
too
she
inches
tall
said
mike
almost
stunned
she
just
two
inches
shorter
than
me
and
she
says
she
does
mind
being
a
midget
so
much
since
she
heard
about
me
i
going
to
write
her
but
it
would
be
of
course
a
long
time
before
there
was
a
way
for
mail
to
get
down
to
earth
it
was
a
long
time
now
it
was
possible
to
send
up
robot
rockets
to
the
platform
they
came
up
when
the
second
arrived
haney
went
out
to
pull
it
in
joe
forgot
to
notify
brown
in
writing
an
hour
before
launching
a
rocket
recovery
vehicle
space
wagon
according
to
paragraph
of
the
formal
memo
nor
the
time
of
launching
in
hours
minutes
by
greenwich
mean
time
paragraph
nor
was
the
testing
of
all
equipment
made
before
moving
it
into
the
airlock
this
was
because
the
testing
equipment
was
in
the
airlock
where
it
belonged
and
the
commands
for
launching
were
not
given
by
brown
or
an
officer
designated
by
him
because
joe
forgot
all
about
it
brown
made
a
stormy
scene
about
the
matter
and
joe
was
honestly
apologetic
but
the
chief
and
haney
and
mike
glared
venomously
the
result
was
completely
inconclusive
joe
had
not
been
put
under
brown
command
he
and
his
crew
were
the
only
people
on
the
platform
physically
in
shape
to
operate
the
space
wagons
considering
the
acceleration
involved
brent
and
the
others
were
wearing
gravity
simulators
and
were
building
back
to
strength
but
they
were
up
to
par
as
yet
they
been
in
space
too
long
so
there
was
nothing
brown
could
do
he
retreated
into
icily
correct
outraged
dignity
and
the
others
hauled
in
and
unloaded
rockets
as
they
arrived
they
came
up
fast
the
processes
of
making
them
had
been
improved
they
could
be
made
faster
heated
to
sintering
temperature
faster
and
the
hulls
cooled
to
usefulness
in
a
quarter
of
the
former
time
the
production
of
space
ship
hulls
went
up
to
four
a
day
while
the
molds
for
the
moonship
were
being
worked
even
faster
the
moonship
actually
was
assembled
from
precast
individual
cells
which
then
were
welded
together
it
would
have
features
the
platform
lacked
because
it
was
designed
to
be
a
base
for
exploration
and
military
activities
in
addition
to
research
but
only
twenty
days
after
the
recovery
and
docking
of
the
first
robot
ship
to
rise
a
new
sort
of
ship
entirely
came
blindly
up
as
a
robot
the
little
space
wagons
hauled
it
to
the
airlock
and
inside
they
unloaded
it
and
it
was
no
longer
a
robot
it
was
a
modified
hull
designed
for
the
duties
of
a
tug
in
space
it
could
carry
a
crew
of
four
and
its
cargohold
was
accessible
from
the
cabin
it
had
an
airlock
more
it
carried
a
cargo
of
rockets
which
could
be
shifted
to
firing
racks
outside
its
hull
starting
from
the
platform
where
it
had
no
effective
weight
it
was
capable
of
direct
descent
to
the
earth
without
spiralling
or
atmospheric
braking
to
make
that
descent
it
would
obviously
expend
of
its
loaded
weight
in
rockets
and
since
it
had
no
weight
at
the
platform
but
only
mass
it
was
capable
of
journeying
it
could
literally
take
off
from
the
platform
and
reach
the
moon
and
land
on
it
and
then
return
to
the
platform
but
that
had
to
wait
sure
we
could
do
it
agreed
joe
when
mike
wistfully
pointed
out
the
possibility
it
would
be
good
to
try
it
but
unfortunately
space
exploration
is
a
stunt
we
gotten
this
far
because
somebody
wanted
to
do
something
but
then
he
said
it
could
be
done
and
the
united
nations
would
do
it
so
the
united
states
had
to
or
somebody
else
would
have
you
can
figure
who
that
would
be
and
what
use
make
of
space
travel
so
it
important
it
more
important
than
stunt
flights
we
could
make
nobody
could
stop
us
if
we
wanted
to
take
off
mike
said
rebelliously
true
joe
said
but
we
four
can
stand
three
gravities
acceleration
and
handle
any
more
manned
rockets
that
start
out
here
we
lived
through
plenty
more
than
that
but
brent
and
the
others
could
put
up
a
fight
in
space
they
wearing
harness
now
and
they
coming
back
to
strength
but
we
going
to
stay
right
here
and
do
stevedoring
and
fighting
too
if
it
comes
to
that
until
the
job
is
done
and
that
was
the
way
it
was
too
of
stevedoring
there
was
plenty
two
robot
ships
a
day
for
weeks
on
end
three
ships
a
day
for
a
time
four
sometimes
things
went
smoothly
and
the
little
space
wagons
could
go
out
and
bring
back
the
great
hulls
from
earth
but
once
in
three
times
the
robots
were
going
too
fast
or
too
slow
the
space
wagons
could
handle
them
then
the
new
ship
the
space
tug
went
out
and
hooked
onto
the
robot
with
a
chain
and
used
the
power
it
had
to
bring
them
to
their
destination
and
sometimes
the
robots
did
climb
straight
at
least
once
the
space
tug
captured
an
erratic
robot
miles
from
its
destination
and
hauled
it
in
it
used
some
heavy
rockets
on
that
trip
the
platform
had
become
in
fact
a
port
in
space
though
so
far
it
had
had
only
arrivals
and
no
departures
its
storage
compartments
almost
bulged
with
fuel
stores
and
food
stores
and
equipment
of
every
imaginable
variety
it
had
a
stock
of
rockets
which
were
enough
to
land
it
safely
on
earth
though
there
was
surely
no
intention
of
doing
so
it
had
food
and
air
for
centuries
it
had
repair
parts
for
all
its
own
equipment
and
it
had
weapons
it
contained
in
robot
hulls
anchored
to
its
sides
enough
fissionable
material
to
conduct
a
deadly
war
which
was
only
stored
for
transfer
to
the
moon
base
when
that
should
be
established
and
it
had
communication
with
earth
of
high
quality
so
far
the
actual
mail
was
only
a
service
but
even
entertainment
came
up
and
news
once
there
was
a
television
shot
of
the
interior
of
the
shed
it
was
carefully
scrambled
before
transmission
but
it
was
a
heartening
sight
the
shed
on
the
tv
screen
appeared
a
place
of
swarming
activity
robot
hulls
were
being
made
they
were
even
improved
fined
down
to
ten
tons
of
empty
weight
apiece
and
their
controls
were
assembly
line
products
now
and
there
was
the
space
flight
simulator
with
men
practicing
in
it
although
for
the
time
being
only
robots
were
taking
off
from
earth
and
there
was
the
moonship
it
did
look
like
the
platform
but
rather
like
something
a
child
might
have
put
together
out
of
building
blocks
it
was
built
up
out
of
cells
with
strengthening
members
added
it
was
feet
high
from
the
floor
and
twice
as
long
and
it
did
not
weigh
nearly
what
it
seemed
to
already
it
was
being
clad
in
that
thick
layer
of
heat
insulation
it
would
need
to
endure
the
lunar
night
it
could
take
off
very
soon
now
the
pictured
preparations
back
on
earth
meant
drudgery
for
joe
and
the
others
they
wore
themselves
out
but
the
storage
space
on
the
platform
filled
up
days
and
weeks
went
by
then
there
came
a
time
when
literally
nothing
else
could
be
stored
so
joe
and
his
crew
made
ready
to
go
back
to
earth
they
ate
hugely
and
packed
a
very
small
cargo
in
their
ship
they
picked
up
one
bag
of
mail
and
four
bags
of
scientific
records
and
photographs
which
had
only
been
transmitted
by
facsimile
tv
before
they
got
into
the
space
tug
it
floated
free
will
fire
in
ten
said
a
crisp
voice
in
headphones
nine
eight
seven
six
five
four
three
two
one
fire
joe
crooked
his
index
finger
there
was
an
explosive
jolt
rockets
flamed
terribly
in
emptiness
the
space
tug
rushed
toward
the
west
the
platform
seemed
to
dwindle
with
startling
suddenness
it
seemed
to
rush
away
and
become
lost
in
the
myriads
of
stars
the
space
tug
accelerated
at
four
gravities
in
the
direction
opposed
to
its
orbital
motion
as
the
acceleration
built
up
it
dropped
toward
earth
and
home
like
a
tumbled
stone
there
was
bright
sunshine
at
the
shed
not
a
single
cloud
in
all
the
sky
the
radar
bowls
atop
the
roof
they
seemed
almost
invisibly
small
compared
with
its
vastness
wavered
and
shifted
and
quivered
completely
invisible
beams
of
microwaves
lanced
upward
atop
the
shed
in
the
communication
room
there
was
the
busy
quiet
of
absolute
intentness
signals
came
down
and
were
translated
into
visible
records
which
fed
instantly
into
computers
then
the
computers
clicked
and
hummed
and
performed
incomprehensible
integrations
and
out
of
their
poured
billowing
ribbons
of
printed
tape
men
read
those
tapes
and
talked
crisply
into
microphones
and
their
words
went
swiftly
aloft
again
down
by
the
open
eastern
door
of
the
shed
at
the
desert
edge
sally
holt
and
joe
father
waited
together
watching
the
sky
sally
was
white
and
scared
joe
father
patted
her
shoulder
reassuringly
he
make
it
all
right
said
sally
joe
father
nodded
of
course
he
will
but
his
voice
was
not
steady
nothing
could
happen
to
him
now
said
sally
fiercely
of
course
not
said
joe
father
a
loudspeaker
close
to
them
said
abruptly
there
was
a
tiny
straggling
thread
of
white
visible
in
the
now
it
thinned
out
to
nothingness
but
its
nearest
part
flared
out
and
flared
out
and
flared
out
it
grew
larger
came
closer
with
a
terrifying
speed
said
the
speaker
harshly
the
trail
of
smoke
was
like
a
crippled
plane
falling
flaming
from
the
sky
except
that
no
plane
ever
fell
so
fast
at
seven
miles
the
glare
of
the
rocket
flames
was
visible
even
in
broad
daylight
at
three
miles
the
light
was
unbearably
bright
at
two
the
light
winked
out
sally
saw
something
which
glittered
come
plummeting
toward
the
ground
unsupported
it
fell
almost
half
a
mile
before
rocket
fumes
flung
furiously
out
again
then
it
checked
visibly
its
descent
was
slowed
it
dropped
more
slowly
and
more
slowly
and
more
slowly
still
it
hung
in
a
up
then
there
was
a
fresh
burst
of
rocket
fumes
more
monstrous
than
ever
and
it
went
steadily
downward
touched
the
ground
and
stayed
there
spurting
terrible
incandescent
flames
for
seconds
then
the
bottom
flame
went
out
an
instant
later
there
were
no
more
flames
at
all
sally
began
to
run
toward
the
ship
she
stopped
a
procession
of
rumbling
clanking
machinery
moved
out
of
the
shed
and
toward
the
upright
space
tug
prosaically
a
bulldozer
lowered
its
wide
blade
some
fifty
yards
from
the
ship
it
pushed
a
huge
mass
of
earth
before
it
covering
over
the
scorched
and
impossibly
hot
sand
about
the
rocket
landing
place
other
bulldozers
began
to
circle
methodically
around
and
around
overturning
the
earth
and
burying
the
hot
surface
stuff
water
trucks
sprayed
and
thin
steam
arose
but
also
an
opened
and
joe
stood
in
the
opening
then
sally
began
to
run
again
joe
sat
at
dinner
in
the
major
quarters
major
holt
was
there
and
joe
father
and
sally
it
feels
good
said
joe
warmly
to
use
a
knife
and
fork
again
and
to
pick
food
up
from
a
plate
where
it
stays
until
it
picked
up
the
crew
of
the
platform
major
holt
began
they
all
right
said
joe
with
his
mouth
full
they
wearing
gravity
simulator
harness
brent
got
his
up
to
gravity
they
get
tired
wearing
the
harness
they
sleep
better
fine
they
can
handle
the
space
wagons
we
left
and
they
got
guided
missiles
to
spare
they
all
right
joe
father
said
unsteadily
you
stay
on
earth
a
while
now
son
sally
moved
quickly
she
looked
up
tense
but
joe
said
they
going
to
get
the
moonship
up
sir
we
came
back
my
gang
and
me
to
help
train
the
crew
we
only
have
a
week
to
do
it
in
but
we
got
some
combat
tactics
to
show
them
on
the
training
gadget
in
the
shed
he
added
anxiously
and
sir
they
have
to
take
the
moonship
off
in
a
spiral
orbit
she
ca
go
straight
up
that
means
she
got
to
pass
over
enemy
territory
and
we
got
to
have
a
real
escort
for
her
a
fighting
escort
it
planned
for
the
space
tug
to
take
off
a
few
minutes
after
the
moonship
and
blast
along
underneath
we
dump
guided
missiles
out
like
drones
and
if
anything
comes
along
we
can
start
their
rockets
and
fight
our
way
through
and
we
four
have
had
more
experience
than
anybody
else
we
needed
you
done
enough
surely
sally
cried
the
united
states
said
joe
awkwardly
is
going
to
take
over
the
moon
i
ca
miss
having
a
hand
in
that
not
if
it
at
all
possible
i
afraid
you
will
miss
it
joe
major
holt
said
detachedly
the
occupation
of
the
moon
will
be
a
navy
enterprise
space
exploration
project
facilities
are
being
used
to
prepare
for
it
but
the
navy
won
the
latest
battle
of
the
pentagon
the
navy
takes
over
the
moon
joe
looked
startled
but
you
space
exploration
personnel
said
the
major
with
the
same
coolness
you
will
be
used
to
instruct
naval
personnel
and
your
space
tug
will
be
asked
to
go
along
to
the
platform
as
an
auxiliary
vessel
for
purposes
of
assisting
in
the
landing
of
the
moonship
at
the
platform
you
understand
you
haul
her
away
from
the
platform
when
she
refueled
and
supplied
so
she
can
start
off
for
the
moon
but
the
occupation
of
the
moon
will
be
strictly
navy
joe
expression
became
carefully
unreadable
i
think
he
said
evenly
i
better
not
comment
major
holt
nodded
very
wise
not
that
we
repeat
anything
you
did
say
but
the
point
is
joe
that
just
one
day
before
the
moonship
does
take
off
the
united
nations
will
be
informed
that
it
is
a
united
states
naval
vessel
the
doctrine
of
the
freedom
of
space
like
the
freedom
of
the
seas
will
be
promulgated
and
the
united
states
will
say
that
a
united
states
naval
task
force
is
starting
off
into
space
on
an
official
mission
to
attack
a
space
exploration
ship
is
one
thing
that
like
a
scientific
expedition
but
to
fire
on
an
american
warship
on
official
business
is
a
declaration
of
war
especially
since
that
ship
can
shoot
back
and
will
joe
listened
he
said
it
daring
somebody
to
try
another
pearl
harbor
exactly
said
the
major
it
time
for
us
to
be
firm
now
that
we
can
back
it
up
i
do
think
the
moonship
will
be
fired
on
but
they
need
me
and
my
gang
just
the
same
said
joe
slowly
for
tugboat
work
at
the
platform
exactly
said
the
major
then
joe
said
doggedly
they
get
us
my
gang
will
gripe
about
being
edged
out
of
the
trip
they
wo
like
it
but
they
like
backing
out
still
less
we
play
it
the
way
it
dealt
but
we
wo
pretend
to
like
it
major
holt
expression
did
not
change
at
all
but
joe
had
an
odd
feeling
that
the
major
approved
of
him
yes
that
right
joe
his
father
added
you
you
have
to
go
aloft
once
more
son
after
that
we
talk
it
over
sally
had
said
a
word
during
the
discussion
but
she
watched
joe
every
second
later
out
on
the
porch
of
the
major
quarters
she
had
a
great
deal
to
say
but
that
could
affect
the
facts
the
world
at
large
of
course
received
no
inkling
of
the
events
in
preparation
the
shed
and
the
town
of
bootstrap
and
all
the
desert
for
a
circle
round
about
were
absolutely
barred
to
all
visitors
anybody
who
came
into
that
circle
stayed
in
most
people
were
kept
out
all
that
anyone
outside
could
discover
was
that
enormous
quantities
of
cryptic
material
had
poured
and
still
were
pouring
into
the
shed
but
this
time
security
was
genuinely
tight
educated
guesses
could
be
made
and
they
were
made
but
nobody
outside
the
area
save
a
very
few
officials
had
any
real
knowledge
the
world
only
knew
that
something
drastic
and
remarkable
was
in
prospect
mike
though
was
able
to
write
a
letter
to
the
girl
who
written
him
major
holt
arranged
it
mike
wrote
his
letter
on
paper
supplied
by
security
with
ink
supplied
by
security
and
while
watched
by
security
officers
his
letter
was
censored
by
major
holt
himself
and
it
did
not
reveal
that
mike
was
back
on
earth
but
it
did
invite
a
reply
and
mike
sweated
as
he
waited
for
one
the
others
had
plenty
to
sweat
about
joe
and
haney
and
the
chief
were
acting
as
instructors
to
the
moonship
crew
they
taught
practical
space
navigation
at
first
they
thought
they
had
much
to
pass
on
but
they
found
out
otherwise
they
had
to
pass
on
data
on
everything
from
how
to
walk
to
how
to
drink
coffee
how
to
eat
sleep
why
one
should
wear
gravity
harness
and
the
manners
and
customs
of
ships
in
space
they
had
to
show
why
in
space
fighting
a
ship
might
send
missiles
on
before
it
but
would
really
expect
to
do
damage
with
those
it
left
behind
they
had
to
warn
of
the
dangers
of
unshielded
sunshine
and
the
equal
danger
of
standing
in
shadow
for
more
than
five
minutes
and
they
had
material
for
six
months
of
instruction
courses
but
there
was
barely
a
week
to
pass
it
on
joe
was
run
ragged
but
in
spite
of
everything
he
managed
to
talk
at
some
length
with
sally
he
found
himself
curiously
anxious
to
discuss
any
number
of
things
with
his
father
too
who
suddenly
appeared
to
be
much
more
intelligent
than
joe
had
ever
noticed
before
he
was
almost
unhappy
when
it
was
certain
that
the
moonship
would
take
off
for
space
on
the
following
day
he
talked
about
it
with
sally
the
night
before
look
he
said
awkwardly
as
far
as
i
concerned
this
has
turned
out
a
pretty
sickly
business
but
when
we
have
got
a
base
on
the
moon
be
a
good
job
done
there
will
be
one
thing
that
nobody
can
stop
everybody
been
living
in
terror
of
war
if
we
hold
the
moon
the
cold
war
will
be
ended
you
ca
kick
on
my
wanting
to
help
end
that
sally
smiled
at
him
in
the
moonlight
and
meanwhile
said
joe
clumsily
well
when
i
come
back
we
can
do
some
serious
talking
about
well
careers
and
such
things
until
then
no
use
right
sally
smile
wavered
very
sensible
she
agreed
wrily
and
awfully
silly
joe
i
know
what
kind
of
a
career
i
want
what
other
fascinating
topic
do
you
know
to
talk
about
joe
i
do
know
of
any
oh
yes
mike
got
a
letter
from
his
girl
i
know
what
she
said
but
he
walking
on
air
but
it
is
funny
said
sally
indignantly
mike
a
person
a
fine
person
if
he
let
me
i
write
to
his
girl
myself
and
try
to
make
friends
with
her
so
when
you
come
back
i
maybe
i
can
be
a
sort
of
that
i
like
joe
said
warmly
you
swell
sometimes
sally
sally
looked
at
him
enigmatically
in
the
moonlight
there
are
times
when
it
seems
to
escape
your
attention
she
observed
the
next
morning
she
cried
a
little
when
he
left
her
to
climb
in
the
space
tug
which
was
so
small
a
part
of
today
activity
joe
and
his
crew
were
the
only
living
men
who
had
ever
made
a
round
trip
to
the
platform
and
back
but
now
there
was
the
moonship
to
go
farther
than
they
been
allowed
it
was
even
clumsier
in
design
than
the
platform
though
it
was
smaller
but
it
was
designed
to
stay
in
space
it
was
to
rest
on
the
powdery
floor
of
a
central
plain
let
it
get
off
into
space
and
somehow
get
to
the
platform
to
reload
then
let
it
replace
the
rockets
it
would
burn
in
this
and
it
could
go
on
out
to
emptiness
it
would
make
history
as
the
first
serious
attempt
by
human
beings
to
reach
the
moon
joe
and
his
followers
would
go
along
simply
to
handle
guided
missiles
if
it
came
to
a
fight
and
to
tow
the
moonship
to
its
wharf
the
platform
and
out
into
midstream
again
when
it
resumed
its
journey
and
that
was
all
the
moonship
lifted
from
the
floor
of
the
shed
to
the
sound
of
hundreds
of
pushpot
engines
then
the
space
tug
roared
skyward
her
rockets
here
substituted
for
the
pushpots
her
rockets
were
also
of
the
nonpoisonous
variety
because
she
fired
them
at
a
bare
feet
they
were
substitutes
for
the
jatos
the
pushpots
carried
she
was
out
in
space
when
the
rockets
roared
dully
outside
her
hull
when
the
moonship
crossed
the
west
coast
of
africa
the
space
tug
was
miles
below
and
miles
behind
when
the
moonship
crossed
arabia
the
difference
was
miles
vertically
and
less
than
in
line
then
the
moonship
released
small
objects
steadied
by
gyroscopes
and
flung
away
by
puffs
of
compressed
air
the
small
objects
spread
out
haney
and
mike
and
the
chief
had
reloaded
the
firing
racks
from
inside
the
ship
and
now
were
intent
upon
control
boards
and
radar
they
pressed
buttons
one
by
one
little
puffs
of
smoke
appeared
in
space
they
had
armed
the
little
space
missiles
setting
off
tiny
flares
which
had
no
function
except
to
prove
that
each
missile
was
ready
for
use
by
the
time
the
two
space
craft
floated
toward
india
above
an
area
from
which
war
rockets
had
been
known
to
rise
there
were
more
little
weapons
floating
with
them
one
screen
of
missiles
hurtled
on
before
the
space
tug
and
another
behind
anything
that
came
up
from
earth
would
instantly
be
attacked
by
dozens
of
midget
ships
bent
upon
suicide
radar
probed
the
space
formation
but
enemies
of
the
fleet
and
the
platform
very
wisely
did
no
more
than
probe
the
moonship
and
its
attendants
went
across
the
pacific
still
rising
above
the
longitude
of
washington
the
space
tug
left
its
former
post
and
climbed
nudging
the
moonship
this
way
and
that
and
from
behind
the
platform
came
floating
splendidly
tiny
figures
in
space
suits
extended
the
incredibly
straight
lines
which
were
plastic
hoses
filled
with
air
very
very
gently
indeed
the
great
bulbous
platform
and
the
squat
flat
moonship
came
together
and
touched
they
moored
in
contact
and
then
the
inert
small
missiles
that
had
floated
below
all
the
way
up
flared
simultaneously
their
rockets
emitted
smoke
in
fine
alignment
they
plunged
forward
through
emptiness
swerved
with
a
remarkable
precision
and
headed
out
for
emptiness
beyond
the
orbit
their
function
had
been
to
protect
the
moonship
on
its
way
out
that
function
was
performed
there
were
too
many
of
them
to
recover
so
they
went
out
toward
the
stars
when
their
rockets
burned
out
they
vanished
but
a
good
hour
later
when
it
was
considered
that
they
were
as
far
out
as
they
were
likely
to
go
they
began
to
blow
up
specks
of
flame
like
the
tiniest
of
new
stars
flickered
against
the
background
of
space
but
joe
and
the
others
were
in
the
platform
by
then
they
brought
up
mail
for
the
crew
and
they
were
back
on
duty
the
platform
seemed
strange
with
the
moonship
crew
aboard
it
had
been
a
gigantic
artificial
world
with
very
few
inhabitants
with
naval
ratings
about
plus
the
four
of
its
regular
crew
plus
the
space
tug
complement
it
seemed
excessively
crowded
and
it
was
busy
there
were
new
men
to
be
guided
as
they
applied
what
they
been
taught
aground
about
life
in
space
it
was
three
full
earthdays
before
the
stores
intended
for
the
journey
to
the
moon
and
the
maintenance
of
a
base
there
really
began
to
move
the
tug
and
the
space
wagons
had
to
be
moored
outside
and
reached
only
by
space
suits
through
small
personnel
airlocks
and
there
was
the
matter
of
discipline
lieutenant
commander
brown
had
been
put
in
command
of
the
platform
for
experience
in
space
he
was
considered
to
be
prepared
for
command
of
the
moonship
by
that
experience
so
now
he
turned
over
command
of
the
platform
to
brent
he
made
a
neat
ceremony
of
it
and
took
over
the
ship
that
would
go
out
to
the
moon
he
made
another
ceremony
out
of
that
in
command
of
the
moonship
his
manner
to
joe
was
absolutely
correct
he
followed
regulations
to
the
letter
to
a
degree
that
left
joe
blankly
uncomprehending
but
he
would
have
gotten
along
in
the
navy
if
he
had
he
tried
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
platform
and
it
practical
but
he
ignored
all
differences
between
joe
and
himself
he
made
no
overtures
of
friendship
but
that
was
natural
unintentionally
joe
had
defied
him
he
now
deliberately
overlooked
all
that
and
joe
approved
of
him
within
limits
but
mike
and
haney
and
the
chief
did
not
they
laid
for
him
and
they
considered
that
they
got
him
when
he
took
over
the
moonship
lieutenant
commander
brown
naturally
maintained
naval
discipline
and
required
snappy
official
naval
salutes
on
all
suitable
occasions
even
in
the
platform
and
joe
gang
privately
tipped
off
the
noncommissioned
personnel
of
the
moonship
thereafter
no
enlisted
man
ever
saluted
lieutenant
brown
without
first
gently
detaching
his
shoes
from
the
floor
when
a
man
was
free
a
really
snappy
salute
gave
a
diverting
result
the
man
body
tilted
forward
to
meet
his
rising
arm
the
upward
impetus
was
and
every
man
who
saluted
brown
immediately
made
a
spectacular
kowtow
which
left
him
rigidly
at
salute
floating
somewhere
overhead
with
his
back
to
lieutenant
brown
with
a
little
practice
it
was
possible
to
add
a
somersault
to
the
other
features
on
one
historic
occasion
brown
walked
clanking
into
a
storeroom
where
a
dozen
men
were
preparing
supplies
for
transfer
to
the
moonship
a
voice
cried
shun
and
instantly
twelve
men
went
floating
splendidly
about
the
storeroom
turning
leisurely
somersaults
all
rigidly
at
salute
and
all
wearing
regulation
poker
faces
an
order
abolishing
salutes
in
weightlessness
followed
shortly
after
it
took
four
days
to
get
the
transfer
of
supplies
properly
started
it
took
eight
to
finish
the
job
affixing
fresh
rockets
to
the
outside
of
the
moonship
hull
alone
called
for
long
hours
in
space
suits
during
this
time
mike
floated
nearby
in
a
space
wagon
one
of
the
navy
men
was
a
trifle
overcourageous
he
affected
to
despise
safety
lines
completing
the
of
a
landing
rocket
he
straightened
up
too
abruptly
and
went
floating
off
toward
the
milky
way
mike
brought
him
back
after
that
there
was
less
trouble
even
so
the
moonship
and
the
platform
were
linked
together
for
thirteen
full
days
during
which
the
platform
seemed
extraordinarily
crowded
on
the
fourteenth
day
the
two
ships
sealed
off
and
separated
joe
and
his
crew
in
the
space
tug
hauled
the
moonship
a
good
five
miles
from
the
platform
the
space
tug
returned
to
the
platform
a
blinker
signal
came
across
the
interval
it
was
a
very
crisp
formal
message
then
the
rockets
on
the
moonship
hull
spurted
their
fumes
the
big
ship
began
to
move
not
outward
from
earth
of
course
that
was
where
it
was
going
but
it
had
the
platform
miles
per
hour
of
orbital
speed
if
the
bonds
of
gravitation
could
have
been
snapped
at
just
the
proper
instant
that
speed
alone
would
have
carried
the
moonship
all
the
way
to
its
destination
but
they
could
so
the
moonship
blasted
to
increase
its
orbital
speed
it
would
swing
out
and
out
and
as
the
earth
pull
grew
weaker
with
distance
the
same
weight
of
rockets
would
move
the
same
mass
farther
and
farther
toward
the
moon
the
moonship
course
would
be
a
sort
of
slowly
flattening
curve
receding
from
earth
and
becoming
almost
a
straight
line
where
and
the
moon
gravitational
fields
cancelled
each
other
from
there
the
moonship
would
have
only
to
brake
its
fall
against
a
gravity
that
of
earth
and
reaching
out
a
vastly
shorter
distance
joe
and
the
others
watched
the
roiling
masses
of
rocket
fumes
as
the
ship
seemed
to
grow
infinitely
small
we
should
been
in
that
ship
said
haney
heavily
when
the
naked
eye
could
no
longer
pick
it
out
we
could
beat
her
to
the
moon
joe
said
nothing
he
ached
a
little
inside
but
he
reflected
that
the
men
who
guided
the
platform
to
its
orbit
had
been
overshadowed
by
himself
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
a
later
achievement
always
makes
an
earlier
one
look
small
now
the
four
of
them
would
be
forgotten
history
would
remember
the
commander
of
the
moonship
forgotten
yes
perhaps
but
the
names
of
the
four
of
them
joe
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
would
still
be
remembered
in
a
language
joe
could
speak
in
a
small
village
he
could
name
on
those
occasions
when
the
mohawk
tribe
met
in
formal
council
the
chief
grumbled
mike
stared
out
the
port
with
bitter
envy
it
was
a
dirty
trick
growled
the
chief
we
shoulda
been
part
of
the
first
gang
ever
to
land
on
the
moon
joe
grimaced
his
crew
needed
to
be
cured
of
feeling
the
same
way
he
did
i
would
say
this
outside
of
our
gang
said
joe
carefully
but
if
it
had
been
for
us
four
that
ship
would
be
on
the
way
at
all
haney
figured
the
trick
that
got
us
back
to
earth
the
first
time
or
else
we
have
been
killed
if
we
had
been
killed
mike
would
have
figured
out
the
business
but
for
him
that
moonship
would
even
be
a
gleam
in
anybody
eye
and
if
the
chief
had
blown
up
that
manned
rocket
we
fought
in
the
space
wagons
there
would
be
any
platform
up
here
to
reload
and
refuel
the
moonship
so
they
left
us
behind
but
just
among
the
four
of
us
i
think
we
can
figure
that
if
it
had
been
for
us
they
could
have
made
it
haney
grinned
slowly
at
joe
the
chief
regarded
him
with
irony
mike
said
yeah
haney
and
me
and
the
chief
we
did
it
all
said
the
chief
sardonically
us
three
just
us
three
joe
did
do
anything
just
a
bum
he
is
we
oughta
tell
sally
he
no
good
and
she
oughta
pick
herself
out
a
guy
that
amount
to
something
some
day
he
hit
joe
between
the
shoulders
sure
just
a
bum
joe
all
but
we
got
a
weakness
for
you
we
let
you
hang
around
with
us
just
the
same
come
on
guys
let
get
something
to
eat
the
four
of
them
marched
down
a
corridor
their
shoes
clanking
on
the
plates
their
progress
was
uncertain
and
ungainly
and
altogether
undignified
suddenly
the
chief
began
to
bawl
a
completely
irrelevant
song
to
the
effect
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
kingdom
of
siam
were
never
known
to
wash
their
dishes
haney
chimed
in
and
mike
they
were
all
very
close
together
and
they
were
not
at
all
impressive
but
it
hit
joe
very
hard
this
sudden
knowledge
that
the
others
did
really
care
it
was
the
first
time
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
haney
and
mike
and
the
chief
would
rather
be
left
behind
with
him
as
a
gang
than
go
on
to
individual
high
achievement
in
a
first
landing
on
the
moon
it
felt
good
it
felt
good
but
that
and
all
other
sources
of
satisfaction
was
wiped
out
by
news
that
came
back
from
the
moonship
a
bare
six
hours
later
the
moonship
was
in
trouble
the
sequence
and
timing
of
its
rocket
blasts
were
worked
out
on
earth
and
checked
by
visual
and
radar
observation
the
computations
were
done
by
electronic
brains
the
moonship
could
not
possibly
have
carried
and
everything
worked
out
the
ship
was
on
course
and
its
firings
were
on
schedule
but
then
the
unexpected
happened
it
was
an
error
which
no
machine
could
ever
have
predicted
for
which
statistics
and
computations
could
never
have
compensated
it
was
a
error
at
the
signal
for
the
final
acceleration
blast
the
pilot
of
the
moonship
had
fired
the
wrong
set
of
rockets
inexperience
stupidity
negligence
excitement
the
reason
matter
after
years
of
planning
and
working
and
dreaming
one
human
finger
had
made
a
mistake
and
the
mistake
was
fatal
when
the
mistake
was
realized
they
had
sense
enough
to
cut
loose
the
rockets
but
the
damage
had
been
done
the
ship
was
still
plunging
on
it
would
reach
the
moon
but
it
would
land
in
aristarchus
crater
as
planned
it
would
crash
if
every
rocket
remaining
mounted
on
the
hull
were
to
be
fired
at
the
best
possible
instant
the
moonship
would
hit
near
copernicus
and
it
would
land
with
a
terminal
velocity
of
feet
per
second
miles
an
hour
it
could
even
be
calculated
that
when
the
moonship
landed
the
explosion
ought
to
be
visible
from
earth
with
a
fairly
good
telescope
it
was
due
to
take
place
in
hours
plus
or
minus
a
few
minutes
the
others
got
the
space
tug
into
the
platform
lock
and
did
things
to
it
in
the
way
of
loading
that
its
designers
never
intended
while
joe
was
calling
earth
for
calculations
the
result
was
infuriating
the
moonship
had
taken
off
for
the
moon
on
the
other
side
of
the
orbit
when
it
had
a
velocity
of
more
than
miles
an
hour
in
the
direction
it
wished
to
go
the
platform
and
of
course
the
space
tug
was
now
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
platform
orbit
and
of
course
they
now
had
a
velocity
of
more
than
miles
per
hour
away
from
the
direction
in
which
it
was
urgently
necessary
for
the
space
tug
to
go
they
could
wait
for
two
hours
to
take
off
said
earth
or
waste
the
time
and
fuel
they
need
to
throw
away
to
duplicate
the
effect
of
waiting
but
we
ca
wait
raged
joe
then
he
snapped
look
here
suppose
we
take
off
from
here
dive
at
earth
make
a
and
let
its
gravity
curve
our
course
like
a
cometary
path
figure
that
that
what
we
got
to
do
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
went
diving
down
to
the
airlock
over
his
shoulder
he
panted
an
order
for
the
man
to
relay
anything
from
earth
down
to
him
there
he
arrived
to
find
haney
and
mike
in
hot
argument
over
whether
it
was
possible
to
load
on
an
extra
ton
or
two
of
mass
he
stopped
it
they
would
everything
loaded
he
demanded
okay
space
suits
all
set
get
out
of
this
lock
and
start
blasting
he
drove
them
into
the
space
tug
he
climbed
in
himself
he
closed
the
entrance
port
the
plastic
walls
of
the
lock
bulged
out
pulled
back
fast
and
the
steering
rockets
jetted
the
space
tug
came
out
of
the
lock
it
spun
about
it
aimed
for
earth
and
monstrous
bursts
of
spread
out
behind
it
it
dived
naturally
when
a
ship
from
the
platform
wanted
to
reach
earth
for
it
was
more
economical
to
head
away
from
it
now
that
it
was
the
most
urgent
of
all
possible
necessities
to
get
away
from
earth
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
space
tug
present
motion
it
was
logical
to
dive
toward
it
the
ship
would
plunge
toward
earth
and
earth
gravity
would
help
its
rockets
in
the
attainment
of
frenzied
speed
but
the
tug
still
possessed
its
orbital
speed
so
it
would
not
actually
strike
the
earth
but
would
be
carried
eastward
past
its
disk
even
though
aimed
for
earth
yet
earth
would
continue
to
pull
as
the
space
tug
skimmed
past
its
path
would
be
curved
by
the
pull
of
gravity
at
the
nearest
possible
approach
to
earth
the
tug
would
fire
its
heaviest
rockets
for
maximum
acceleration
and
it
would
swing
around
earth
atmosphere
perhaps
no
more
than
miles
high
just
barely
beyond
the
measurable
presence
of
air
and
come
out
of
that
crazy
curve
a
good
hour
ahead
of
the
platform
for
a
corresponding
position
and
with
a
greater
velocity
than
could
be
had
in
any
other
way
traced
on
paper
the
course
of
the
tug
would
be
a
tight
parabola
the
ship
dived
and
it
happened
that
it
had
left
the
platform
and
plunged
deep
in
earth
shadow
so
that
the
look
and
feel
of
things
was
that
of
an
utterly
suicidal
plunge
into
oblivion
there
was
the
seeming
of
a
vast
sack
of
pure
blackness
before
the
nose
of
the
space
tug
she
started
for
it
at
four
gravities
acceleration
and
joe
got
his
headphones
to
his
ears
and
lay
panting
while
he
waited
for
the
figures
and
information
he
had
to
have
he
got
them
when
the
rockets
burned
out
the
tug
crew
painstakingly
adjusted
the
ship
nose
to
a
certain
position
they
flung
themselves
back
into
the
acceleration
chairs
and
joe
fired
a
blast
they
came
out
of
that
and
he
fired
another
the
three
blasts
gave
the
ship
a
downward
speed
of
a
mile
and
a
half
a
second
and
earth
pull
added
to
it
steadily
the
earth
itself
was
drawing
them
down
most
of
a
fall
which
added
to
the
speed
their
rockets
built
up
down
on
earth
wavered
dizzily
hunting
for
them
to
feed
them
observations
of
position
and
data
for
their
guidance
back
on
the
platform
members
of
the
crew
feverishly
made
their
own
computations
when
the
four
in
the
space
tug
were
to
earth
they
were
traveling
faster
than
any
humans
had
ever
traveled
before
relative
to
the
earth
or
the
platform
itself
when
they
were
a
thousand
miles
from
earth
it
was
certain
they
would
clear
its
edge
joe
proposed
and
received
an
okay
to
fire
a
salvo
of
mark
tens
to
speed
the
ship
still
more
when
they
burned
to
the
and
flashed
away
past
the
ports
the
chief
and
haney
panted
up
from
their
chairs
and
made
their
way
aft
going
to
reload
the
gasped
the
chief
they
vanished
the
space
tug
could
take
rockets
from
its
cargo
and
set
them
outside
its
hull
for
firing
no
other
ship
could
haney
and
the
chief
came
back
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
ship
save
for
a
small
tinny
voice
in
joe
headphones
we
pass
earth
miles
high
said
joe
in
a
flat
voice
maybe
closer
i
going
to
try
to
make
it
we
be
smack
over
enemy
territory
but
i
doubt
they
could
hit
us
we
be
hitting
better
than
six
miles
a
second
if
we
wanted
to
we
could
spend
some
more
rockets
and
hit
escape
velocity
but
we
want
to
stop
later
we
ride
it
out
silence
stillness
speed
out
the
ports
to
earthward
there
was
purest
blackness
on
the
other
side
a
universe
of
stars
but
the
blackness
grew
and
grew
and
grew
until
it
neatly
bisected
the
cosmos
itself
and
half
of
everything
that
was
was
blackness
half
was
tiny
colored
stars
then
there
was
a
sound
a
faint
sound
it
was
a
moan
it
was
a
howl
it
was
a
shriek
and
then
it
was
a
mere
thin
moan
again
then
it
was
not
we
touched
air
said
joe
calmly
at
six
and
a
quarter
miles
per
second
pretty
thin
though
at
that
we
may
have
left
a
for
the
populace
to
admire
nobody
said
anything
at
all
in
a
little
while
there
was
light
ahead
there
was
brightness
instantly
it
seemed
they
were
out
of
night
and
there
was
a
streaming
tumult
of
clouds
flashing
past
below
but
they
were
miles
up
now
and
joe
headphones
rattled
and
he
said
now
we
can
give
a
touch
of
and
maybe
a
trace
of
speed
rockets
droned
and
boomed
and
roared
outside
the
hull
the
earth
fell
away
and
away
and
presently
it
was
behind
and
they
were
plunging
on
after
the
moonship
which
was
very
very
very
far
on
before
them
it
was
actually
many
hours
before
they
reached
it
they
could
afford
to
overtake
it
gradually
because
they
had
to
have
time
to
work
in
after
contact
but
overtaking
it
swiftly
cost
extra
fuel
and
they
had
too
much
so
they
compromised
and
came
up
behind
the
moonship
at
better
than
feet
per
second
difference
in
speed
they
approached
it
as
fast
as
most
travel
and
all
creation
was
blotted
out
by
the
fumes
of
the
rockets
they
fired
for
deceleration
then
the
space
tug
came
cautiously
close
to
the
moonship
mike
climbed
out
on
the
outside
of
the
tug
hull
with
the
chief
also
in
space
equipment
paying
out
mike
mike
leaped
across
two
hundred
yards
of
emptiness
with
of
gulf
beneath
him
his
metal
soles
clanked
on
the
moonship
hull
then
the
on
the
tug
lighted
up
lieutenant
commander
brown
looked
out
of
it
quietly
grim
joe
flicked
on
his
own
transmitter
he
nodded
said
brown
evenly
did
not
contact
you
before
because
i
was
not
certain
that
contact
could
be
made
how
many
passengers
can
you
take
back
to
the
platform
joe
blinked
at
him
i
have
any
idea
he
said
but
i
going
to
hitch
on
and
use
our
rockets
to
land
you
do
not
think
it
said
brown
calmly
believe
the
only
result
of
such
a
course
will
be
the
loss
of
both
ships
with
all
hands
i
will
give
you
a
written
authorization
to
return
on
my
order
but
since
all
my
crew
ca
return
how
many
can
you
take
i
have
ten
married
men
aboard
six
have
children
can
you
take
six
or
all
ten
then
he
said
without
a
trace
of
emphasis
course
none
of
them
will
be
if
i
tried
to
turn
back
now
i
think
my
crew
would
mutiny
joe
said
coldly
i
hate
to
think
they
would
anyhow
we
going
to
hook
on
and
play
this
out
the
way
it
lies
there
was
a
pause
then
brown
spoke
again
kenmore
i
was
hoping
you
say
that
actually
er
not
to
be
quoted
you
understand
actually
intelligent
defiance
has
always
been
in
the
traditions
of
the
navy
of
course
you
not
in
the
navy
kenmore
but
right
now
it
looks
like
the
navy
is
in
your
hands
like
a
battleship
in
the
hands
of
a
tug
good
luck
joe
flicked
off
the
screen
you
know
he
said
winking
at
mike
i
guess
brown
is
such
a
bad
egg
after
all
let
go
in
minutes
the
space
tug
had
a
line
made
fast
in
half
an
hour
the
two
space
craft
were
bound
firmly
together
but
far
enough
apart
for
the
rocket
blasts
to
dissipate
before
they
reached
the
moonship
mike
returned
to
the
tug
a
pair
of
the
big
mark
twenty
rockets
burned
frenziedly
in
emptiness
the
moonship
was
slowed
by
a
fraction
of
its
speed
the
deceleration
was
hardly
perceptible
there
were
more
burnings
back
on
earth
there
were
careful
measurements
a
tight
beam
tends
to
attenuate
when
it
is
thrown
a
hundred
thousand
miles
it
tends
to
when
speech
is
conducted
over
it
the
lag
between
comment
and
reply
is
perceptible
it
not
great
just
over
half
a
second
but
one
notices
it
that
lag
was
used
to
measure
the
speed
and
distance
of
the
two
craft
the
prospect
did
look
too
good
the
space
tug
burned
rocket
after
rocket
after
rocket
there
was
no
effect
that
joe
could
detect
of
course
it
would
have
been
like
noticing
the
effect
of
single
in
a
rowboat
miles
from
shore
but
the
instruments
on
earth
found
a
difference
they
made
very
very
very
careful
computations
and
the
electronic
brains
did
the
calculations
which
battalions
of
mathematicians
would
have
needed
years
to
work
out
the
electronic
calculations
which
could
not
make
a
mistake
said
that
it
was
a
the
moon
came
slowly
to
float
before
the
two
linked
ships
it
grew
slowly
slowly
larger
the
word
from
earth
was
that
considering
the
rockets
still
available
in
the
space
tug
and
those
that
should
have
been
fired
but
were
on
the
moonship
there
must
be
no
more
blasts
just
yet
the
two
ships
must
pass
together
through
the
where
the
gravities
of
earth
and
moon
exactly
cancel
out
they
must
fall
together
toward
the
moon
forty
miles
above
the
lunar
surface
rockets
were
to
be
fired
at
twenty
miles
others
at
five
miles
the
moonship
itself
must
fire
its
remaining
with
luck
it
was
a
safety
or
a
smash
but
there
was
a
long
time
to
wait
joe
and
his
crew
relaxed
in
the
space
tug
the
chief
looked
out
a
port
and
observed
i
can
see
the
now
stuff
too
i
wonder
if
anybody
ever
saw
that
before
not
likely
said
joe
mike
stared
out
a
port
haney
looked
also
how
we
going
to
get
back
joe
the
moonship
has
rockets
on
board
joe
told
him
only
they
stick
them
in
the
outside
they
stowed
away
all
shipshape
navy
fashion
after
we
land
we
ask
politely
for
rockets
to
get
back
to
the
platform
with
it
be
a
tedious
run
mostly
coasting
falling
free
but
we
make
it
if
everything
does
blow
when
we
land
said
the
chief
joe
said
uncomfortably
it
wo
not
that
somebody
wo
try
then
he
stopped
after
a
moment
he
said
awkwardly
look
it
necessary
that
we
humans
get
to
the
stars
or
ultimately
we
crowd
the
earth
until
we
wo
be
able
to
stay
human
we
have
to
have
wars
and
plagues
and
such
things
to
keep
our
numbers
down
it
it
seems
to
me
and
i
think
been
said
before
that
it
looks
like
there
something
somewhere
that
afraid
of
us
humans
it
does
want
us
to
reach
the
stars
it
did
want
us
to
fly
before
that
it
did
want
us
to
learn
how
to
cure
disease
or
have
steam
or
anything
that
makes
men
different
from
the
beasts
haney
turned
his
head
he
listened
intently
maybe
it
sounds
superstitious
said
joe
uneasily
but
there
always
been
somebody
trying
to
smash
everything
the
rest
of
us
wanted
as
if
as
if
something
alien
and
hateful
went
around
whispering
hypnotically
into
men
ears
while
they
slept
commanding
them
irresistibly
to
do
things
to
smash
all
their
own
hopes
the
chief
grunted
huh
think
that
new
stuff
joe
admitted
joe
but
it
true
something
fights
us
you
can
make
wild
guesses
maybe
things
on
far
planets
that
know
that
if
ever
we
reach
there
there
something
that
hates
men
and
it
tries
to
make
us
destroy
ourselves
sure
said
haney
mildly
i
learned
about
that
in
sunday
school
joe
maybe
i
mean
that
said
joe
helplessly
but
anyhow
there
something
we
fight
and
there
something
that
fights
with
us
so
i
think
going
to
get
the
moonship
down
all
right
mike
said
sharply
you
mean
you
think
this
is
all
worked
out
in
advance
that
we
be
here
we
get
here
the
chief
said
impatiently
it
figured
out
so
we
can
do
it
if
we
got
the
innards
we
got
the
chance
we
can
duck
it
but
if
we
duck
it
bad
and
somebody
else
has
to
have
the
chance
later
i
know
what
saying
us
men
we
got
to
get
to
the
stars
there
millions
of
and
we
need
the
planets
they
got
swimming
around
haney
said
some
of
them
have
planets
that
known
yeah
those
planets
ai
going
to
go
on
forever
with
nobody
using
grunted
the
chief
it
do
make
sense
and
things
in
general
do
make
sense
all
but
us
humans
he
finished
with
a
grin
and
i
like
us
anyhow
joe
right
we
get
by
this
time
and
if
we
do
some
other
guys
have
to
do
the
job
of
landing
on
the
moon
but
it
be
done
as
a
starter
i
can
see
lots
of
mountains
down
there
plain
mike
said
quietly
what
the
radar
say
joe
looked
back
at
the
platform
it
had
shown
the
curve
of
the
surface
of
earth
here
a
dim
line
was
beginning
to
show
on
the
screen
it
was
the
curve
of
the
surface
of
the
moon
we
might
as
well
get
set
said
joe
we
got
time
but
we
might
as
well
space
suits
on
i
tighten
up
the
chain
steering
rockets
do
that
then
we
take
a
last
look
all
firing
racks
loaded
outside
yeah
said
haney
he
grinned
wrily
you
know
joe
i
know
what
i
know
but
still
i
scared
me
too
said
joe
but
there
were
things
to
do
they
took
their
places
they
watched
out
the
ports
the
moon
had
seemed
a
vast
round
ball
a
little
while
back
now
it
appeared
to
be
flattening
its
edges
still
curved
away
beyond
a
surprisingly
nearby
horizon
the
were
amazingly
distinct
there
were
incredibly
wide
smooth
spaces
with
mottled
colorings
but
the
mountains
when
the
ships
were
miles
high
the
space
tug
blasted
valorously
and
all
the
panorama
of
the
moon
surface
was
momentarily
hidden
by
the
racing
clouds
of
mist
the
rockets
burned
out
haney
and
the
chief
replaced
the
rockets
they
were
gigantic
tubes
which
they
could
have
stirred
on
earth
now
they
loaded
them
into
the
curious
locks
which
conveyed
them
outside
the
hull
into
firing
position
the
were
gigantic
when
they
blasted
again
they
were
only
miles
up
then
and
some
of
the
peaks
rose
four
miles
from
their
inner
crater
floors
the
ships
were
still
descending
fast
joe
spoke
into
his
microphone
calling
moonship
calling
he
stopped
and
said
i
suggest
we
fire
our
last
blast
together
shall
i
give
the
word
right
the
surface
of
the
moon
came
toward
them
craters
cracks
frozen
fountains
of
stone
swelling
undulations
of
ground
interrupted
without
rhyme
or
reason
by
the
gigantic
splashings
of
missiles
from
the
sky
a
hundred
thousand
million
years
ago
the
colorings
were
unbelievable
there
were
reds
and
browns
and
yellows
there
were
grays
and
dusty
and
streaks
of
completely
impossible
tints
in
combination
but
joe
could
watch
that
he
kept
his
eyes
on
a
very
special
gadget
which
was
a
radar
he
had
used
it
about
the
platform
because
there
were
too
many
tin
cans
and
such
trivia
floating
about
it
would
be
dependable
but
it
did
measure
the
exact
distance
to
the
nearest
solid
object
prepare
for
firing
on
a
count
of
five
said
joe
quietly
five
four
three
two
one
fire
the
space
tug
rockets
blasted
for
the
first
time
since
they
overtook
the
moonship
the
tug
now
had
help
the
remaining
rockets
outside
the
moonship
hull
blasted
furiously
out
the
ports
there
was
nothing
but
hurtling
whitenesses
the
rockets
droned
and
rumbled
and
roared
the
main
rockets
burned
out
the
steering
rockets
still
boomed
joe
had
thrown
them
on
for
what
good
their
lift
might
do
joe
said
haney
in
a
surprised
tone
i
feel
weight
not
much
but
some
and
the
main
rockets
are
off
joe
nodded
he
watched
the
instruments
before
him
he
shifted
a
control
and
the
space
tug
swayed
it
swayed
over
to
the
limit
of
the
it
had
fastened
to
the
moonship
joe
shifted
his
controls
again
there
was
a
peculiar
gritty
contact
somewhere
joe
cut
the
steering
rockets
and
it
was
possible
to
look
out
there
were
more
gritty
noises
the
space
tug
settled
a
little
and
leaned
a
little
it
was
still
then
there
was
no
noise
at
all
yes
said
joe
we
got
some
weight
we
on
the
moon
they
went
out
of
the
ship
in
a
peculiarly
solemn
procession
about
them
reared
cliffs
such
as
no
man
had
ever
looked
on
before
save
in
dreams
above
their
heads
hung
a
huge
round
greenish
globe
with
a
white
polar
plainly
visible
it
hung
in
and
was
four
times
the
size
of
the
moon
as
seen
from
earth
if
one
stood
still
and
looked
at
it
it
would
undoubtedly
be
seen
to
be
revolving
once
in
some
hours
mike
scuffled
in
the
dust
in
which
he
walked
nobody
had
emerged
from
the
moonship
yet
the
four
of
them
were
literally
the
first
human
beings
ever
to
set
foot
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
but
none
of
them
mentioned
the
fact
though
all
were
acutely
aware
of
it
mike
kicked
up
dust
it
rose
in
a
curiously
fashion
there
was
no
air
to
scatter
it
it
settled
deliberately
back
again
mike
spoke
with
an
odd
constraint
no
green
cheese
he
said
absurdly
no
agreed
joe
let
go
over
to
the
moonship
it
looks
all
right
it
could
have
landed
hard
they
went
toward
the
bulk
of
the
ship
from
earth
which
now
was
a
base
for
the
military
occupation
of
a
globe
with
more
than
all
earth
continents
put
together
but
not
a
drop
of
water
the
moonship
was
tilted
slightly
askew
but
it
was
patently
unharmed
there
were
faces
at
every
port
in
the
hull
the
chief
stopped
suddenly
a
sizable
boulder
rose
from
the
dust
the
chief
struck
it
smartly
with
his
hand
i
counting
coup
on
the
moon
he
said
zestfully
tie
that
you
guys
then
he
joined
the
others
on
their
way
to
the
moonship
main
lock
shall
we
knock
asked
mike
humorously
i
doubt
they
got
a
but
the
was
opening
to
admit
them
they
crowded
inside
commander
brown
was
waiting
for
them
with
an
hand
glad
to
have
you
aboard
and
there
was
a
genuine
smile
creeping
across
his
face
joe
talked
with
careful
distinctness
into
a
microphone
his
voice
took
a
little
over
a
second
to
reach
its
destination
then
there
was
a
pause
of
the
same
length
before
the
first
syllable
of
sally
reply
came
to
him
from
earth
i
reported
to
your
father
said
joe
carefully
and
the
moonship
has
reported
to
the
navy
in
a
couple
of
hours
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
and
i
will
be
taking
off
to
go
back
to
the
platform
we
got
rockets
from
the
stores
of
the
moonship
sally
voice
was
surprisingly
clear
it
wavered
a
little
but
there
was
no
sound
of
static
to
mar
reception
then
what
joe
i
bringing
written
reports
and
photographs
and
first
specimens
of
geology
from
the
moon
joe
told
her
i
a
mailman
it
probably
be
sixty
hours
back
to
the
platform
free
fall
most
of
the
way
and
then
we
refuel
and
i
come
down
to
earth
to
deliver
the
reports
and
such
pause
one
second
and
a
little
for
his
voice
to
go
another
second
and
something
over
for
her
voice
to
return
and
then
that
what
i
trying
to
find
out
said
joe
what
day
is
today
