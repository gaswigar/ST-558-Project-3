was
such

beautiful
stepmother
on

face

the
next
morning
the
girls
spent
in
packing
and
getting
ready
to
go
ashore
they
also
read
books
of
history
outside
of
school
hours
quite
from
choice
they
were
all
perched
on
patty
big
bed
alone
at
last
just

chapter
i
plans
for
patty
the
fairfields
were
holding
a
family
conclave
as
the
fairfield
family
consisted
of
only
three
members
the
meeting
was
not
large
but
it
was
highly
enthusiastic
the
discussion
was
about
patty
and
as
a
consequence
patty
herself
was
taking
a
lively
part
in
it
but
you
promised
me
last
year
papa
she
said
that
if
i
graduated
from
the
oliphant
school
with
honours
i
need
go
to
school
this
year
but
i
meant
in
the
city
explained
her
father
it
absurd
patty
for
you
to
consider
your
education
finished
and
you
not
yet
eighteen
but
i
soon
be
eighteen
papa
and
so
suppose
we
postpone
this
conversation
until
then
do
be
frivolous
my
child
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
requires
careful
consideration
and
wise
judgement
that
so
said
nan
and
as
i
have
already
considered
it
carefully
i
will
give
you
the
benefit
of
my
wise
judgment
though
nan
face
had
assumed
the
expression
of
an
owl
named
solomon
there
was
a
smile
in
her
eyes
and
patty
well
knew
that
her
stepmother
views
agreed
with
her
own
rather
than
with
those
of
her
father
it
was
the
last
week
in
september
and
the
fairfields
were
again
in
their
pleasant
city
home
after
their
summer
in
the
country
patty
and
nan
were
both
fond
of
city
life
and
were
looking
forward
to
a
delightful
winter
of
course
patty
was
too
young
to
be
in
society
but
there
were
many
simple
pleasures
which
she
was
privileged
to
enjoy
and
she
and
nan
had
planned
a
series
of
delightful
affairs
quite
apart
from
the
more
elaborate
functions
which
nan
would
attend
with
her
husband
but
fairfield
had
suddenly
interfered
with
their
plans
by
announcing
his
decision
that
patty
should
go
to
college
this
had
raised
such
a
storm
of
dissension
from
both
nan
and
patty
that
fairfield
so
far
amended
his
resolution
as
to
propose
a
instead
but
patty
was
equally
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
either
and
rebelled
at
the
suggestion
of
going
away
from
home
and
as
nan
quite
coincided
with
patty
in
her
opinions
on
this
matter
she
was
fighting
bravely
for
their
victory
against
fairfield
very
determined
opposition
all
her
life
patty
had
deferred
to
her
father
advice
not
only
willingly
but
gladly
but
in
the
matter
of
school
she
had
very
strong
prejudices
she
had
never
enjoyed
school
life
and
during
her
last
year
at
miss
oliphant
she
had
worked
so
hard
that
she
had
almost
succumbed
to
an
attack
of
nervous
prostration
but
she
had
persevered
in
her
hard
work
because
of
the
understanding
that
it
was
to
be
her
last
year
at
school
and
now
to
have
college
or
even
a
thrown
at
her
head
was
enough
to
rouse
even
her
gentle
spirit
for
patty
was
of
gentle
spirit
although
upon
occasion
especially
when
she
felt
that
an
injustice
was
being
done
she
could
rouse
herself
to
definite
and
impetuous
action
and
as
she
now
frankly
told
her
father
she
considered
it
unjust
after
she
had
thought
that
commencement
marked
the
end
of
her
school
life
to
have
a
college
course
sprung
upon
her
unaware
but
fairfield
only
laughed
and
told
her
that
she
was
incapable
of
judging
what
was
best
for
little
girls
and
that
she
would
do
wisely
to
obey
orders
without
question
but
patty
had
questioned
and
her
questions
were
reinforced
by
those
of
nan
until
fairfield
began
to
realise
that
it
was
doubtful
if
he
could
gain
his
point
against
their
combined
forces
and
indeed
a
kind
and
indulgent
father
and
husband
is
at
a
disadvantage
when
his
opinion
is
opposed
to
that
of
his
pretty
impulsive
daughter
and
his
charming
impulsive
wife
so
at
this
by
no
means
the
first
serious
discussion
of
the
matter
fairfield
found
himself
weakening
and
had
already
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
might
as
well
prepare
to
yield
gracefully
go
on
nan
cried
patty
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
wise
judgment
why
i
think
said
nan
looking
at
her
husband
with
an
adorable
smile
which
seemed
to
assume
that
he
would
agree
with
her
that
a
college
education
is
advisable
even
necessary
for
a
girl
who
expects
to
teach
or
indeed
to
follow
any
profession
but
i
quite
sure
we
do
look
forward
to
that
for
patty
no
said
fairfield
i
ca
seem
to
see
patty
teaching
a
district
school
how
to
shoot
neither
does
my
imagination
picture
her
as
a
woman
doctor
or
a
lady
lawyer
but
to
my
mind
there
are
occasions
in
the
life
of
a
private
citizeness
when
a
knowledge
of
classic
lore
is
not
only
beneficial
but
decidedly
ornamental
now
papa
began
patty
i
not
going
to
spend
my
life
as
a
butterfly
of
fashion
or
a
grasshopper
of
giddiness
and
you
know
it
but
all
the
same
i
ca
think
of
a
single
occasion
where
i
should
be
embarrassed
at
my
ignorance
of
sanscrit
or
distressed
at
the
fact
that
i
was
unacquainted
personally
with
the
statutes
of
limitation
you
talking
nonsense
patty
and
you
know
it
the
straight
truth
is
that
you
do
like
school
life
and
school
restraint
now
some
girls
enjoy
the
fun
and
pleasures
of
college
life
and
think
that
they
more
than
compensate
for
the
drudgery
of
actual
study
exile
from
home
pleasure
dazzles
in
vain
sang
patty
whose
spirits
had
risen
for
she
felt
intuitively
that
her
father
was
about
to
give
up
his
cherished
plans
i
think
went
on
nan
after
you
have
asked
for
my
valuable
advice
you
might
let
me
give
it
without
so
many
interruptions
i
will
proceed
to
remark
that
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
only
two
reasons
why
a
girl
should
go
to
college
because
she
wants
to
or
because
she
needs
the
diploma
in
her
future
career
since
you
put
it
so
convincingly
i
have
no
choice
but
to
agree
with
you
said
her
husband
smiling
however
if
i
eliminate
the
college
suggestion
there
still
remains
the
i
think
that
a
superior
young
ladies
finishing
school
would
add
greatly
to
the
advantages
of
our
patty
it
would
finish
me
entirely
papa
your
college
scheme
is
bad
enough
but
a
school
as
you
call
it
presents
to
my
fancy
all
sorts
of
unknown
horrors
of
course
it
does
cried
nan
i
will
now
give
you
some
more
of
my
wise
advice
a
finishing
school
would
be
of
no
advantage
at
all
to
our
patty
i
believe
their
principal
end
and
aim
is
to
teach
young
ladies
how
to
enter
a
room
properly
now
i
have
never
seen
patty
enter
a
room
except
in
the
most
correct
decorous
and
highly
approved
fashion
it
does
seem
foolish
then
to
send
the
poor
child
away
for
a
year
to
practise
an
art
in
which
she
is
already
proficient
you
two
are
one
too
many
for
me
said
fairfield
laughing
if
i
had
either
of
you
alone
i
could
soon
reduce
you
to
a
state
of
meek
obedience
but
your
combined
forces
are
too
much
for
me
and
i
may
as
well
surrender
at
once
and
completely
no
but
seriously
fred
you
must
see
that
it
is
really
so
now
what
patty
needs
in
the
way
of
education
is
the
best
possible
instruction
in
music
which
she
can
have
better
here
in
new
york
than
in
any
college
then
she
ought
to
go
on
with
her
french
in
which
she
is
already
remarkably
proficient
then
perhaps
an
hour
a
day
of
reading
literature
with
a
competent
teacher
and
i
guarantee
that
a
year
at
home
will
do
more
for
patty
than
any
school
full
of
masters
fairfield
looked
at
his
young
wife
in
admiration
why
nan
i
believe
you
right
he
said
though
i
do
believe
it
because
of
any
change
in
my
own
opinions
but
because
you
put
it
so
convincingly
that
i
have
an
argument
left
nan
only
smiled
and
went
on
you
said
yourself
fred
that
patty
disliked
the
routine
and
restraint
of
school
life
and
so
i
think
it
would
be
cruel
to
force
her
into
it
when
she
can
be
so
much
happier
at
home
here
she
will
have
ample
time
for
all
the
study
i
have
mentioned
and
still
have
leisure
for
the
pleasures
that
she
needs
and
deserves
i
shall
look
after
her
singing
lessons
myself
and
make
sure
that
she
practises
properly
then
i
shall
take
her
to
the
opera
and
to
concerts
which
though
really
a
part
of
her
musical
education
may
also
afford
her
some
slight
pleasure
patty
flew
over
to
nan
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
neck
you
dear
old
duck
she
cried
there
never
was
such
a
dear
lovely
beautiful
stepmother
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
now
it
all
settled
it
papa
it
seems
to
be
said
fairfield
smiling
but
on
your
own
heads
be
the
consequences
i
put
patty
into
your
hands
now
so
far
as
her
future
education
is
concerned
and
you
can
fix
it
up
between
you
to
tell
the
truth
i
delighted
myself
at
the
thought
of
having
patty
stay
home
with
us
but
my
sense
of
duty
made
me
feel
that
i
must
at
least
put
the
matter
before
her
and
you
did
cried
patty
gleefully
and
now
i
put
it
behind
me
and
that
all
there
is
about
that
and
i
promise
papa
to
study
awfully
hard
on
my
french
and
music
and
as
for
reading
that
will
be
no
hardship
for
i
rather
read
than
eat
any
day
fairfield
had
really
acquiesced
to
the
wishes
of
the
others
out
of
his
sheer
for
he
did
not
think
that
the
lessons
at
home
would
be
as
definite
and
regular
as
at
a
school
and
he
still
held
his
original
opinions
in
the
matter
but
having
waived
his
theories
for
theirs
he
raised
no
further
objection
and
seemed
to
consider
the
question
settled
after
a
moment
however
he
said
thoughtfully
what
you
really
ought
to
have
patty
is
a
year
abroad
that
would
do
more
for
you
in
the
way
of
general
information
and
liberal
education
than
anything
else
now
that
would
be
right
down
splendid
said
patty
come
on
papa
let
all
go
i
would
in
a
minute
dear
but
i
ca
leave
my
business
just
now
it
has
increased
alarmingly
of
late
and
it
needs
my
constant
attention
to
keep
up
with
it
indeed
it
is
becoming
so
ridiculously
successful
that
unless
i
can
check
it
we
shall
soon
be
absurdly
rich
people
then
you
can
retire
said
nan
and
we
can
all
go
abroad
for
benefit
yes
said
fairfield
seriously
after
a
year
or
two
we
can
do
that
i
exactly
retire
but
i
shall
get
the
business
into
such
shape
that
i
can
take
a
long
vacation
and
then
we
all
go
out
and
see
the
world
but
that
does
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
with
patty
immediate
future
i
have
thought
over
this
a
great
deal
and
if
you
do
go
to
college
patty
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
you
go
abroad
sooner
than
i
can
take
you
but
i
ca
see
any
way
for
you
to
go
i
ca
spare
nan
to
go
with
you
and
i
not
sure
you
would
care
to
go
with
one
of
those
parties
of
personally
conducted
young
ladies
no
indeed
cried
patty
i
crazy
to
go
to
europe
but
i
do
want
to
go
with
six
other
girls
and
a
chaperon
and
go
flying
along
from
one
country
to
the
next
with
a
baedeker
in
one
hand
and
a
suit
case
in
the
other
i
much
rather
wait
and
go
with
you
and
nan
later
on
well
i
have
finished
thinking
it
out
yet
said
fairfield
who
in
spite
of
his
apparent
pliability
had
a
strong
will
of
his
own
i
may
send
you
across
in
charge
of
a
reliable
guardian
and
put
you
into
a
french
convent
illustration
with
caption
never
was
such
a
dear
lovely
beautiful
stepmother
on
the
face
of
the
earth
patty
only
laughed
at
this
but
still
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
her
father
was
not
yet
quite
done
with
the
subject
and
that
almost
anything
might
happen
but
as
kenneth
harper
came
in
to
see
them
just
then
the
question
was
laid
before
him
there
is
no
sense
in
patty
going
to
college
he
declared
i
an
authority
on
the
subject
because
i
know
college
and
i
know
patty
and
they
have
absolutely
nothing
in
common
with
each
other
why
patty
does
want
the
things
that
colleges
teach
you
see
she
is
of
an
artistic
temperament
oh
kenneth
cried
patty
reproachfully
that
the
most
fearfully
unkind
thing
i
ever
had
said
to
me
why
i
would
rather
be
accused
of
i
do
know
what
than
an
artistic
temperament
how
could
you
say
it
why
i
as
practical
and
common
sensible
and
straightforward
as
i
can
be
people
who
have
artistic
temperaments
are
flighty
and
and
not
at
all
capable
why
patty
cried
nan
laughing
how
can
you
make
such
sweeping
assertions
hepworth
is
an
artist
and
he
is
all
those
dreadful
things
that
different
declared
patty
hepworth
is
a
real
artist
and
so
you
ca
tell
what
his
temperament
is
but
that
just
what
i
mean
insisted
kenneth
hepworth
is
a
real
artist
and
so
he
did
have
and
did
need
a
college
education
he
specialised
and
devoted
all
his
study
to
his
art
then
he
went
to
paris
and
stayed
there
for
years
still
studying
and
working
i
tell
you
it
specialisation
that
counts
now
i
do
know
that
patty
wants
to
specialise
but
she
certainly
does
need
the
general
work
of
college
i
should
think
that
you
would
prefer
to
have
her
devote
herself
to
her
music
especially
her
singing
for
we
all
know
that
patty
is
a
voice
of
rare
promise
i
do
know
myself
exactly
what
promise
means
but
it
a
phrase
that
always
applied
to
voices
like
patty
you
just
right
kenneth
said
nan
and
i
glad
you
on
our
side
patty
and
i
entirely
agree
with
you
and
though
fairfield
is
still
wavering
a
little
i
am
sure
that
by
day
after
or
next
week
at
the
latest
he
will
be
quite
ready
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
ours
fairfield
only
smiled
for
though
he
had
no
intention
of
making
patty
do
anything
against
her
will
yet
he
had
not
entirely
made
up
his
mind
in
the
matter
anyway
my
child
he
said
whatever
you
do
or
do
do
will
be
the
thing
that
we
are
entirely
agreed
upon
even
if
i
have
to
convince
you
that
my
opinions
are
right
and
patty
smiled
back
at
her
father
happily
for
there
was
great
comradeship
and
sympathy
between
them
chapter
ii
the
decision
it
was
only
a
few
days
later
that
nan
and
patty
sat
one
evening
in
the
library
waiting
for
fairfield
to
come
home
to
dinner
the
fairfield
library
was
a
most
cosey
and
attractive
room
nan
was
a
by
nature
and
as
patty
dearly
loved
pretty
and
comfortable
appointments
they
had
combined
their
efforts
on
the
library
and
the
result
was
a
room
which
they
all
loved
far
better
than
the
more
formal
the
fall
was
coming
early
that
year
which
gave
an
excuse
for
the
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
this
fire
was
made
of
that
peculiar
kind
of
driftwood
whose
flames
show
marvellous
rainbow
tints
patty
never
tired
of
watching
the
blaze
and
delighted
in
throwing
on
more
chips
and
splinters
from
time
to
time
i
ca
see
what
makes
your
father
so
late
said
nan
as
she
wandered
about
the
room
now
adjusting
some
flowers
in
a
vase
and
now
stopping
to
look
out
at
the
front
window
he
always
here
by
this
time
or
earlier
something
must
have
detained
him
said
patty
rather
absently
as
she
poked
at
a
log
with
the
tongs
patty
you
a
true
sherlock
holmes
your
father
is
late
and
you
immediately
deduce
that
something
has
detained
him
truly
you
have
a
wonderful
intellect
i
do
wonder
it
seems
so
to
you
said
saucy
patty
smiling
at
her
pretty
stepmother
people
are
always
impressed
by
traits
they
possess
themselves
but
really
i
getting
worried
if
fred
does
come
pretty
soon
i
shall
telephone
to
the
office
do
i
like
to
see
you
enacting
the
role
of
anxious
young
wife
it
suits
you
perfectly
as
for
me
i
starving
if
papa
does
come
pretty
soon
he
will
find
an
emaciated
skeleton
in
place
of
the
plump
daughter
he
left
behind
him
as
fairfield
arrived
at
that
moment
there
was
no
occasion
for
further
anxiety
but
in
response
to
their
queries
he
gave
them
no
satisfaction
as
to
the
cause
of
his
unusual
tardiness
and
only
smiled
at
their
exclamations
it
was
not
until
they
were
seated
at
the
dinner
table
that
fairfield
announced
he
had
something
to
tell
them
and
i
sure
it
something
nice
said
patty
for
there
a
twinkle
in
the
left
corner
of
your
right
eye
gracious
patty
cried
nan
that
sounds
as
if
your
father
were
and
he
is
well
went
on
fairfield
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
just
this
i
have
arranged
for
the
immediate
future
of
miss
patricia
fairfield
patty
looked
frightened
there
was
something
in
her
father
tone
that
made
her
feel
certain
that
his
mind
was
irrevocably
made
up
and
that
whatever
plans
he
had
made
for
her
were
sure
to
be
carried
out
but
she
resolved
to
treat
it
lightly
until
she
found
out
what
it
was
all
about
i
do
want
to
be
intrusive
she
said
but
if
not
too
presumptuous
might
i
inquire
what
is
to
become
of
me
yours
not
to
make
reply
yours
not
to
reason
why
said
her
father
teasingly
you
know
my
child
you
not
yet
of
age
and
i
as
your
legal
parent
and
guardian
can
do
whatever
i
please
with
you
you
are
as
shakespeare
puts
it
goods
my
chattel
and
so
i
have
decided
to
pack
you
up
and
send
you
away
really
papa
cried
patty
aghast
yes
really
i
remember
you
expressed
a
disinclination
to
leave
your
home
and
family
but
all
the
same
i
have
made
arrangements
for
you
to
do
so
it
was
the
detailing
of
these
arrangements
that
kept
me
so
late
at
my
office
patty
looked
at
her
father
she
understood
his
bantering
tone
and
from
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
she
knew
that
whatever
plans
he
may
have
made
they
were
pleasant
ones
and
too
she
knew
that
notwithstanding
his
air
of
authority
she
need
abide
by
them
unless
she
chose
to
so
she
waited
contentedly
enough
for
his
serious
account
of
the
matter
and
it
soon
came
why
it
this
way
chickabiddy
he
said
farrington
came
to
see
me
at
the
office
this
afternoon
and
laid
a
plan
before
me
it
seems
that
he
and
farrington
and
elise
are
going
to
paris
for
the
winter
and
he
brought
from
himself
and
his
wife
an
invitation
for
you
to
go
with
them
oh
said
patty
she
scarcely
breathed
the
word
but
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
and
her
face
expressed
the
delight
that
the
thought
of
such
a
plan
brought
to
her
oh
she
said
again
as
thoughts
of
further
details
came
crowding
into
her
mind
how
perfectly
glorious
cried
nan
whose
enthusiasm
ran
to
words
as
patty
seemed
struck
dumb
it
the
very
thing
just
what
patty
needs
and
to
go
with
the
farringtons
is
the
most
delightful
way
to
make
such
a
trip
tell
us
all
about
it
fred
when
do
they
start
shall
i
have
time
to
get
patty
some
clothes
no
she
better
buy
them
over
there
oh
patty
you
have
the
most
rapturous
time
do
say
something
you
little
goose
do
sit
there
blinking
as
if
you
did
understand
what
going
on
tell
us
more
about
it
fred
i
will
my
dear
if
you
only
give
me
a
chance
the
farringtons
mean
to
sail
very
soon
in
about
a
fortnight
they
will
go
on
a
french
liner
and
go
at
once
to
paris
except
for
possible
short
trips
they
will
stay
in
the
city
all
winter
then
the
girls
can
study
french
or
music
or
whatever
they
like
and
incidentally
have
some
fun
i
dare
say
farrington
seemed
truly
anxious
to
have
patty
go
although
i
warned
him
that
she
was
a
difficult
young
person
to
manage
but
he
said
he
had
had
experience
in
that
line
last
summer
and
found
that
it
was
possible
to
get
along
with
her
anyway
he
was
most
urgent
in
the
matter
and
said
that
if
i
agreed
to
it
farrington
and
elise
would
come
over
and
invite
her
personally
am
i
to
be
their
guest
entirely
papa
asked
patty
farrington
insisted
that
you
should
but
i
would
agree
to
that
i
shall
pay
all
your
travelling
expenses
hotel
bills
and
incidentals
but
if
they
take
a
furnished
house
in
paris
for
the
season
as
they
expect
to
do
you
will
stay
there
as
their
guest
oh
cried
patty
who
had
found
her
voice
at
last
i
do
think
too
lovely
for
anything
and
you
are
so
good
papa
to
let
me
go
but
wo
it
cost
a
great
deal
and
can
you
afford
it
it
will
be
somewhat
expensive
my
dear
but
i
can
afford
it
for
as
i
told
you
my
finances
are
looking
up
and
too
i
consider
this
a
part
of
your
education
and
so
look
upon
it
as
a
necessary
outlay
but
you
must
remember
that
the
farringtons
are
far
more
wealthy
people
than
we
and
though
you
can
afford
the
necessary
travelling
expenses
you
probably
can
not
be
as
extravagant
in
the
matter
of
personal
expenditure
as
they
i
shall
give
you
what
i
consider
an
ample
allowance
of
pin
money
and
then
you
must
be
satisfied
with
the
number
of
pins
it
will
buy
that
does
worry
me
declared
patty
i
so
delighted
to
go
that
i
do
care
if
i
do
buy
a
thing
over
there
you
change
your
mind
when
you
get
there
and
get
into
the
wonderful
paris
shops
said
her
father
smiling
but
never
fear
puss
have
enough
francs
to
buy
all
the
pretty
dresses
and
gewgaws
and
that
it
proper
for
a
little
girl
like
you
to
have
how
old
are
you
now
patty
almost
eighteen
papa
almost
eighteen
indeed
you
mean
you
only
fairly
well
past
seventeen
but
it
does
matter
remember
you
a
little
girl
and
not
a
society
young
lady
and
conduct
yourself
accordingly
farrington
will
look
out
for
that
said
nan
she
has
the
best
possible
ideas
about
such
things
and
she
brings
up
elise
exactly
in
accordance
with
my
notions
of
what
is
right
that
settles
it
said
fairfield
i
shall
have
no
further
anxiety
on
that
score
since
nan
approves
of
the
outlook
but
patty
girl
going
to
miss
you
here
yes
indeed
cried
nan
i
had
realised
that
side
of
it
oh
patty
we
had
planned
so
many
things
for
this
winter
and
now
i
shall
be
alone
all
day
and
every
day
come
on
and
go
with
me
said
patty
mischievously
no
said
nan
smiling
at
her
husband
i
have
a
stronger
tie
here
even
than
your
delightful
companionship
but
truly
we
shall
miss
you
awfully
of
course
you
will
said
patty
and
i
miss
you
too
but
write
each
other
long
letters
and
oh
i
do
think
the
whole
game
is
perfectly
lovely
so
do
i
agreed
nan
and
then
followed
such
a
lot
of
feminine
planning
and
chatter
that
fairfield
declared
his
advice
seemed
not
to
be
needed
the
next
morning
nan
and
patty
went
over
to
the
farringtons
to
discuss
the
great
subject
they
expressed
to
farrington
their
hearty
thanks
for
her
kind
invitation
but
she
insisted
that
the
kindness
was
all
on
patty
side
as
her
company
would
be
a
great
delight
not
only
to
elise
but
also
to
the
elder
members
of
the
party
is
roger
going
asked
patty
no
said
farrington
this
is
his
last
year
in
college
so
of
course
he
ca
leave
the
other
children
are
in
school
too
so
it
seemed
just
the
right
year
for
us
to
take
elise
abroad
for
a
little
outing
a
winter
in
paris
will
do
both
of
you
girls
good
in
lots
of
ways
and
if
for
any
reason
we
do
enjoy
it
we
can
go
somewhere
else
or
we
can
turn
around
and
come
home
and
no
harm
done
although
the
trip
seemed
such
a
great
event
to
patty
farrington
appeared
to
look
upon
it
merely
as
a
little
outing
and
seemed
so
thoroughly
glad
to
have
patty
go
with
them
that
she
almost
made
patty
feel
as
if
she
were
conferring
the
favour
elise
and
patty
went
away
by
themselves
to
talk
it
all
over
while
nan
stayed
with
farrington
to
discuss
the
more
practical
details
i
did
care
a
bit
about
going
said
elise
until
we
thought
about
your
going
too
and
now
i
crazy
to
go
oh
patty
wo
we
have
the
most
gorgeous
time
yes
indeed
said
patty
i
can
hardly
realise
it
yet
i
perfectly
bewildered
shall
we
go
to
school
elise
i
do
think
so
and
yet
we
may
mother
going
to
take
a
house
you
know
and
then
we
either
have
masters
every
day
or
go
to
some
school
mother
knows
all
about
paris
she
has
lived
there
a
lot
but
we
have
to
study
all
the
time
i
know
that
much
we
go
a
good
deal
and
of
course
we
go
motoring
i
shall
enjoy
the
ocean
trip
said
patty
i
never
been
across
you
know
you
been
a
number
of
times
have
you
yes
but
not
very
lately
we
used
to
go
often
when
roger
and
i
were
little
but
i
have
been
over
for
six
years
and
then
we
were
in
paris
i
sure
i
shall
love
paris
do
you
remember
it
well
no
when
i
was
there
last
i
was
too
little
to
appreciate
it
so
explore
it
together
you
and
i
wish
roger
were
going
with
us
nice
to
have
a
boy
along
to
escort
us
about
yes
it
is
said
patty
frankly
and
roger
is
so
kind
and
when
do
we
sail
elise
two
weeks
from
saturday
i
think
father
is
going
to
see
about
the
tickets
he
waited
to
see
your
father
yesterday
and
make
sure
that
you
could
go
the
whole
thing
has
been
planned
rather
suddenly
but
that
the
way
father
always
does
things
and
it
so
fortunate
went
on
patty
that
i
had
started
away
to
college
or
although
if
i
had
and
you
had
invited
me
i
should
have
managed
some
way
to
get
expelled
from
college
so
i
could
go
with
you
how
long
do
you
suppose
we
shall
stay
elise
i
do
know
i
sure
you
never
can
tell
what
the
farringtons
are
going
to
do
they
here
and
gone
we
stay
all
winter
of
course
and
then
in
the
spring
mother
might
take
a
notion
to
go
to
london
or
she
might
decide
to
come
flying
home
as
for
father
he
probably
bob
back
and
forth
he
does
think
any
more
of
crossing
the
ocean
than
of
crossing
the
street
have
you
much
to
do
to
get
ready
to
go
no
not
much
nan
says
for
me
not
to
get
a
lot
of
clothes
for
better
to
buy
them
over
there
and
papa
says
i
can
buy
all
i
want
only
of
course
i
ca
be
as
extravagant
as
you
are
oh
pshaw
i
not
extravagant
i
do
care
much
about
spending
money
only
of
course
i
like
to
have
some
nice
things
and
i
do
love
to
buy
pictures
and
books
but
we
have
an
awful
lot
of
fun
together
i
think
it
fun
just
to
be
with
you
patty
and
the
idea
of
having
you
all
to
myself
for
a
whole
winter
without
hilda
or
lorraine
or
anybody
claiming
a
part
of
you
is
the
best
of
it
all
i
do
love
you
a
lot
patty
more
than
you
realise
i
think
you
set
your
affections
on
a
worthless
object
then
and
i
warn
you
that
before
the
winter
is
over
you
likely
to
discover
that
for
yourself
you
always
did
overestimate
me
elise
indeed
i
did
but
as
you
well
know
from
that
first
day
at
the
oliphant
school
when
you
were
so
kind
to
me
i
never
liked
anybody
half
as
much
as
i
do
you
you
extremely
flattering
said
patty
as
she
kissed
her
friend
and
i
only
hope
this
winter
wo
prove
a
disillusion
i
not
at
all
afraid
returned
elise
gaily
and
oh
patty
wo
we
have
a
jolly
time
on
board
the
steamer
it
a
long
trip
you
know
and
we
must
take
books
to
read
and
games
to
play
for
as
there
probably
be
mostly
french
people
on
board
we
ca
converse
very
much
you
can
said
patty
laughing
but
i
afraid
no
one
can
understand
my
beautiful
but
somewhat
peculiar
accent
iii
souvenirs
marian
came
over
to
spend
a
few
days
with
patty
before
her
departure
she
was
frankly
envious
of
patty
good
fortune
but
more
than
that
she
was
so
desperately
doleful
at
the
thought
of
patty
going
away
that
she
was
anything
but
a
cheerful
visitor
although
sorry
for
her
cousin
patty
could
help
laughing
at
the
dejected
picture
that
marian
continually
presented
she
followed
patty
around
the
house
wherever
she
went
or
she
would
sit
and
look
at
her
with
her
chin
held
in
her
hands
and
the
big
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
marian
you
are
a
goose
said
patty
exasperated
by
this
performance
when
i
left
vernondale
you
cried
and
carried
on
just
this
way
but
somehow
you
seemed
to
live
through
it
and
now
that
i
live
in
new
york
you
do
see
me
so
very
often
anyhow
so
why
should
you
be
so
disconsolate
about
my
going
away
because
you
going
so
far
and
you
probably
be
drowned
those
french
steamers
are
ever
so
much
more
dangerous
than
the
english
lines
and
somehow
i
just
feel
as
if
you
never
come
back
well
the
best
thing
you
can
do
then
is
to
change
your
feelings
be
back
before
you
hardly
realise
that
i
gone
and
i
bring
you
the
loveliest
presents
you
ever
saw
this
was
a
happy
suggestion
of
patty
for
marian
tears
ceased
to
flow
and
she
brightened
up
at
once
oh
patty
that
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
if
you
are
going
to
bring
me
anything
in
the
way
of
a
gift
or
a
souvenir
you
just
as
lieve
i
tell
you
what
i
want
as
to
have
you
pick
it
out
yourself
and
likely
as
not
bring
me
something
i
do
care
for
at
all
everybody
who
brings
me
home
souvenirs
from
europe
brings
the
most
hideous
things
or
else
something
that
i
ca
possibly
use
why
marian
dear
i
be
only
too
glad
to
have
you
tell
me
what
you
want
and
i
do
my
best
to
select
it
just
right
well
patty
i
want
a
lot
of
photographs
the
kind
we
get
over
here
are
no
good
but
i
seen
the
ones
that
come
from
paris
and
just
as
different
as
day
and
night
i
like
the
venus
of
milo
and
the
mona
lisa
and
the
victory
and
oh
well
i
make
you
out
a
list
there
are
several
madonnas
that
i
want
and
several
more
that
i
want
and
i
do
not
want
any
of
nattier
pictures
or
a
baby
stuart
but
i
do
want
some
of
hinde
hair
curlers
the
kind
i
mean
and
you
can
only
get
them
in
paris
by
this
time
patty
was
shaking
with
laughter
at
marian
list
and
she
asked
her
if
she
did
want
anything
else
but
photographs
and
hair
curlers
why
yes
said
marian
astonished
i
only
just
begun
you
know
photographs
do
cost
much
over
there
and
of
course
the
curlers
count
for
a
present
i
thought
you
meant
to
bring
me
something
nice
i
do
said
patty
looking
at
her
cousin
who
was
so
comically
in
earnest
you
just
go
on
with
your
list
and
i
bring
all
the
things
if
i
have
to
buy
an
extra
trunk
to
bring
them
in
all
right
then
said
marian
encouraged
to
proceed
i
want
a
bead
bag
one
of
those
gay
coloured
ones
made
of
very
small
beads
worked
in
flowers
roses
you
know
or
hibiscus
not
on
any
account
the
tulip
pattern
because
i
hate
it
you
better
write
out
these
instructions
marian
or
i
shall
be
sure
to
get
tulips
by
mistake
do
you
do
it
patty
i
write
them
all
down
most
explicitly
and
then
i
want
a
scarf
a
very
long
one
ground
with
a
persian
border
in
blues
and
greys
but
not
a
border
i
mean
that
queer
stencilled
sort
of
a
design
i
draw
a
pattern
of
it
so
you
ca
mistake
it
but
suppose
i
ca
find
just
that
kind
marian
oh
yes
you
can
ethel
holmes
has
one
and
hers
came
from
paris
and
you
all
winter
to
look
for
it
you
know
well
i
devote
the
winter
to
the
search
but
if
i
do
find
it
along
toward
spring
i
give
it
up
what
else
marian
well
i
like
a
lot
of
napoleon
things
some
old
prints
of
him
you
know
and
perhaps
a
little
bronze
statuette
and
a
cup
and
saucer
or
or
any
of
those
things
that
they
make
with
pictures
of
napoleon
on
and
then
oh
patty
i
do
want
some
cyclamen
perfumery
it
awfully
hard
to
get
there
only
one
firm
that
makes
it
i
forget
the
name
but
it
something
and
their
place
is
across
the
seine
across
the
seine
from
what
why
just
across
on
the
other
side
you
know
of
course
i
do
know
across
from
what
because
i
never
been
to
paris
but
everybody
who
has
lived
there
always
just
says
the
seine
and
everybody
knows
at
once
where
they
mean
you
know
all
right
after
you
lived
there
a
little
while
marian
you
a
wonder
declared
patty
i
do
think
i
ever
knew
anybody
with
such
a
perfect
and
complete
understanding
of
her
own
wants
as
you
seem
to
have
i
hope
you
have
mentioned
half
the
things
to
bring
you
but
do
tell
me
the
rest
now
i
might
change
my
mind
about
going
but
you
buy
a
large
blank
book
and
write
out
all
these
orders
at
full
length
giving
directions
just
when
to
cross
the
seine
and
when
to
cross
back
again
and
i
promise
to
do
my
very
best
with
the
whole
list
patty
you
a
darling
said
marian
and
i
almost
reconciled
to
having
you
go
when
i
think
of
having
souvenirs
brought
to
me
that
i
really
want
marian
said
patty
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
your
idea
of
the
difference
between
desirable
and
undesirable
souvenirs
is
an
interesting
one
now
i
shall
bring
little
gifts
to
all
my
friends
and
relatives
i
expect
and
if
you
happen
to
know
of
anything
that
would
be
especially
liked
by
uncle
charlie
or
aunt
alice
or
any
of
your
family
or
the
tea
club
girls
i
wish
you
make
another
list
and
put
those
things
all
down
for
me
it
would
be
the
greatest
kind
of
a
help
marian
promised
to
do
this
and
patty
felt
sure
that
she
would
be
glad
of
the
lists
later
on
aunt
isabel
and
ethelyn
also
came
to
say
to
patty
but
their
demeanour
was
very
different
from
marian
aunt
isabel
was
much
impressed
by
the
fact
that
patty
was
going
to
travel
with
the
rich
farringtons
but
she
expressed
a
doubt
as
to
whether
it
would
do
patty
much
good
in
a
social
way
after
all
for
she
knew
something
of
farrington
habits
and
tastes
and
they
in
no
way
corresponded
to
her
own
ethelyn
informed
patty
that
she
need
not
bring
her
any
souvenir
unless
she
could
bring
something
really
nice
i
do
hate
the
little
traps
and
trinkets
most
people
bring
she
said
but
if
you
want
to
bring
me
a
bracelet
or
locket
or
something
really
worth
while
i
be
glad
to
have
it
well
exclaimed
patty
i
certainly
have
most
outspoken
cousins
they
do
seem
to
hesitate
to
tell
me
what
to
bring
and
what
not
to
bring
them
but
i
sure
of
one
thing
bumble
barlow
wo
be
so
fussy
particular
she
take
whatever
i
bring
and
be
thankful
so
will
i
said
nan
laughing
anything
no
one
else
wants
patty
you
may
give
it
to
me
do
spend
all
your
money
buying
presents
child
said
aunt
isabel
you
better
buy
pretty
clothes
for
yourself
i
will
give
you
a
list
of
the
best
places
to
shop
thank
you
aunt
isabel
i
take
the
list
with
pleasure
but
of
course
my
purchases
will
be
at
the
advice
of
farrington
she
dresses
elise
quite
simply
and
will
probably
expect
me
to
do
the
same
aunt
isabel
sniffed
you
ought
to
have
gone
to
paris
with
me
she
said
you
growing
up
to
be
a
girl
patty
and
the
right
kind
of
clothes
would
set
you
off
wonderfully
patty
said
nothing
but
as
she
glanced
at
ethelyn
furbelows
she
felt
thankful
she
was
not
going
to
paris
with
aunt
isabel
but
patty
found
that
there
was
quite
a
great
deal
of
shopping
to
be
done
before
she
sailed
nan
took
these
matters
in
charge
and
declared
that
patty
needed
a
complete
though
not
an
elaborate
steamer
outfit
nan
dearly
loved
buying
pretty
clothes
and
was
quite
in
her
element
making
patty
purchases
a
dark
blue
cloth
trimmed
with
touches
of
green
velvet
was
chosen
for
her
travelling
costume
her
dress
marian
persisted
in
calling
it
just
as
if
patty
were
a
bride
but
as
marian
burst
into
tears
every
time
she
mentioned
patty
going
away
her
words
were
so
indistinct
that
it
mattered
little
what
terms
she
used
then
nan
selected
one
or
two
pretty
light
gowns
of
a
somewhat
dressy
nature
for
dinner
on
board
the
steamer
and
one
or
two
simple
evening
gowns
for
the
ship
concert
or
other
festive
occasions
a
white
serge
suit
was
added
for
pleasant
afternoons
on
deck
and
some
dainty
kimonos
and
negligees
for
stateroom
use
patty
was
delighted
with
all
these
things
but
could
scarcely
take
time
to
appreciate
them
as
she
found
so
many
other
things
to
do
by
way
of
her
own
preparations
so
many
people
came
to
see
her
and
she
had
to
go
to
see
so
many
other
people
then
she
had
to
have
her
photographs
taken
to
leave
with
her
friends
and
she
was
constantly
being
invited
to
little
farewell
luncheons
or
teas
indeed
as
patty
expressed
it
the
whole
two
weeks
of
preparation
seems
like
one
long
lingering
farewell
and
when
i
not
saying
to
any
one
else
i
trying
to
stop
marian
freshly
flowing
tears
the
girls
bought
patty
parting
gifts
and
though
they
were
all
either
useful
or
pretty
patty
appreciated
far
more
the
loving
spirit
which
prompted
them
i
made
this
all
myself
said
hilda
as
she
brought
patty
a
dainty
sleeping
gown
of
blue
and
white
french
flannel
because
it
utterly
impossible
to
buy
this
sort
of
thing
and
have
it
just
right
if
you
do
say
this
is
just
right
i
never
make
you
another
as
long
as
i
live
it
exactly
right
hilda
said
patty
taking
the
pretty
garment
i
know
i
shall
dream
of
you
whenever
i
wear
it
and
that
too
bad
too
for
i
ought
to
devote
some
of
my
dreams
to
other
people
this
is
a
cabin
bag
said
lorraine
bringing
her
offering
i
make
it
myself
because
this
is
so
much
neater
and
prettier
than
a
homemade
one
you
see
it
has
a
pocket
for
everything
that
you
can
possibly
require
from
hairpins
to
shoehorn
not
that
you
put
anything
in
the
pockets
nobody
ever
does
but
it
will
look
pretty
decorating
your
cabin
wall
indeed
i
shall
put
things
in
it
said
patty
i
a
great
believer
in
putting
things
in
their
right
places
and
i
shall
think
of
you
lorraine
whenever
i
trying
to
get
the
things
out
of
these
dinky
little
pockets
and
probably
not
succeeding
very
well
this
is
my
gift
said
adelaide
hart
it
is
very
elaborate
but
i
made
it
all
myself
and
that
means
a
good
deal
from
me
patty
opened
the
parcel
and
found
a
piece
of
cretonne
about
a
yard
square
neatly
hemmed
along
each
of
the
four
sides
and
having
a
tape
loop
sewed
on
each
corner
it
perfectly
beautiful
said
patty
and
i
never
saw
more
exquisite
needlework
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
it
is
for
it
ca
be
a
handkerchief
but
i
do
know
of
anything
else
that
exactly
square
how
ignorant
you
are
said
adelaide
with
pretended
superiority
that
my
inexperienced
friend
is
a
wrap
for
your
best
hat
oh
said
patty
not
much
enlightened
you
see
adelaide
kindly
went
on
to
explain
as
soon
as
you
get
on
board
your
steamer
you
take
off
your
best
hat
and
put
it
exactly
in
the
middle
of
this
square
having
first
spread
the
square
out
smoothly
on
the
bed
or
somewhere
then
you
take
up
these
four
corners
by
the
loops
and
hang
the
whole
thing
on
the
highest
hook
in
your
stateroom
thus
you
see
your
best
hat
is
carried
safely
across
it
is
not
jammed
or
crushed
and
it
is
protected
from
dust
i
see
said
patty
gravely
and
i
suppose
the
dust
is
something
awful
on
an
ocean
steamer
the
laugh
seemed
to
be
on
adelaide
at
this
but
she
joined
in
it
and
prophesied
that
when
patty
returned
she
would
confess
that
that
gift
had
proved
the
most
useful
of
all
clementine
morse
brought
a
large
album
which
she
had
filled
with
views
of
new
york
city
i
know
you
will
be
homesick
before
you
out
of
sight
of
land
she
said
but
if
you
not
you
ought
to
be
and
i
hope
these
pictures
will
make
you
so
when
you
look
at
this
highly
colored
representation
of
grant
tomb
and
realise
that
it
is
but
a
few
miles
from
your
own
hearthstone
i
sure
you
will
feel
qualms
of
patriotism
or
something
i
think
very
likely
said
patty
laughing
but
clementine
how
many
trunks
do
you
suppose
i
shall
need
to
hold
my
farewell
gifts
this
album
will
take
up
considerable
space
i
know
it
said
clementine
but
you
need
put
it
in
your
trunk
you
can
carry
it
on
board
in
your
hand
and
then
when
you
go
ashore
you
can
carry
it
in
your
hand
i
do
believe
they
will
charge
you
duty
on
it
especially
as
it
will
probably
be
nearly
worn
out
by
that
time
i
sure
it
will
said
patty
not
only
from
my
own
constant
use
of
it
but
i
know
everybody
on
board
will
want
to
borrow
it
and
enjoy
these
works
of
art
yes
agreed
clementine
and
then
patty
when
you
in
paris
you
can
throw
away
all
these
new
york
cards
and
fill
it
up
with
paris
views
and
bring
it
home
and
give
it
back
to
me
i
certainly
will
clem
that
a
idea
mary
sargent
brought
a
french
phrase
book
it
was
entitled
french
before
breakfast
and
as
mary
explained
that
the
french
people
never
had
breakfast
until
noon
patty
would
have
ample
time
to
study
it
patty
accepted
the
little
book
with
many
thanks
and
promised
mary
she
would
never
eat
breakfast
at
noon
or
any
other
hour
until
she
had
thoroughly
mastered
at
least
one
of
the
phrases
chapter
iv
an
aquatic
party
of
course
all
were
agreed
that
patty
must
have
a
farewell
party
of
some
sort
and
as
nan
dearly
loved
elaborate
affairs
she
had
decided
that
it
should
be
an
aquatic
party
patty
frankly
confessed
her
ignorance
as
to
what
an
aquatic
party
might
be
whereupon
nan
informed
her
that
she
had
only
to
wait
until
the
occasion
itself
to
find
out
so
busy
was
patty
herself
that
she
took
no
hand
in
the
preparations
for
the
party
and
indeed
nan
required
no
help
that
capable
and
energetic
young
matron
secured
the
services
of
some
professional
decorators
and
workmen
but
the
direction
and
superintendence
was
entirely
in
her
own
hands
patty
was
consulted
only
in
regard
to
her
own
costume
for
the
occasion
you
see
said
nan
coming
into
patty
room
one
morning
i
know
whether
you
would
rather
say
to
your
friends
in
the
guise
of
a
kelpie
or
a
pixy
or
a
cut
out
the
said
patty
laughing
for
they
horrid
floppy
old
things
i
sure
as
to
the
others
what
the
difference
between
a
kelpie
and
a
pixy
oh
a
great
deal
of
difference
declared
nan
wagging
her
head
wisely
a
kelpie
is
an
imaginary
water
sprite
you
know
and
a
pixy
is
a
a
why
a
sort
of
fairy
who
lives
in
the
water
well
i
glad
that
you
see
a
difference
in
your
two
definitions
for
my
part
i
do
see
anything
to
hinder
my
being
a
kelpie
and
a
pixy
both
even
if
i
not
twins
well
they
not
so
very
different
you
know
one
is
a
kelpie
and
one
is
a
pixy
that
about
all
the
difference
patty
laughed
well
if
it
will
help
you
out
any
to
have
me
make
a
choice
she
said
i
choose
to
be
a
kelpie
what
the
latest
thing
in
kelpie
costumes
oh
it
will
be
lovely
patty
i
have
it
made
of
pale
green
silk
with
a
frosted
silvery
shimmering
effect
you
know
and
draped
with
trailing
green
seaweed
and
water
grasses
lovely
agreed
patty
and
what
would
the
pixy
costume
have
been
if
i
had
chosen
that
just
the
same
confessed
nan
laughing
but
it
easier
to
have
something
definite
to
work
at
you
can
wear
my
corals
patty
and
with
your
hair
down
you
be
a
perfect
kelpie
patty
smiled
at
her
young
stepmother
enthusiasm
and
nan
ran
away
to
begin
preparations
for
the
kelpie
costume
the
night
of
the
party
the
whole
fairfield
house
was
so
transformed
that
it
must
scarcely
have
recognised
itself
the
large
front
represented
the
arctic
regions
in
the
vicinity
of
the
north
pole
frames
had
been
erected
which
when
covered
with
sheets
simulated
peaks
of
snowy
mountains
and
icebergs
here
and
there
signs
apparently
left
by
explorers
told
the
latitude
and
longitude
and
a
flag
marked
the
explorations
farthest
north
over
these
snow
peaks
scrambled
white
polar
bears
in
most
realistic
fashion
and
in
one
corner
an
esquimau
hut
was
built
the
ceiling
represented
a
clear
blue
sky
and
the
floor
the
blue
water
of
the
open
polar
sea
by
a
clever
arrangement
of
electric
lights
through
colored
shades
a
fair
representation
of
the
aurora
borealis
was
made
to
appear
at
intervals
the
library
which
was
back
of
the
had
been
transformed
into
an
aquarium
all
round
the
walls
waves
of
gauze
simulated
water
in
which
fish
were
gliding
and
swimming
the
illusion
was
heightened
by
other
fishes
which
being
suspended
from
the
ceiling
by
invisible
threads
seemed
to
be
swimming
through
the
air
altogether
the
effect
if
not
entirely
realistic
was
picturesque
and
amusing
and
coral
reefs
and
rocky
cliffs
covered
with
seaweed
gave
aquatic
impressions
even
if
not
entirely
logical
but
nan
pride
was
what
she
chose
to
call
the
upper
deck
this
was
a
room
on
the
second
floor
a
large
front
room
which
had
been
made
to
represent
the
upper
deck
of
a
handsome
yacht
draped
and
held
up
by
poles
formed
the
roof
and
sides
and
a
realistic
railing
surrounded
it
a
dozen
or
more
steamer
chairs
stood
in
line
strewn
with
rugs
pillows
and
novels
coils
of
rope
lanterns
and
other
paraphernalia
added
to
the
realism
of
the
scene
and
at
one
side
a
carefully
constructed
window
opened
into
the
steward
cabin
the
steward
himself
and
was
prepared
to
serve
light
refreshments
exactly
after
the
fashion
of
a
correct
yachting
party
when
the
guests
began
to
arrive
and
were
dressed
in
various
costumes
each
representing
some
type
or
phase
of
water
pleasures
the
scene
took
on
a
gay
and
festive
air
patty
kelpie
costume
was
a
great
success
and
the
girl
never
looked
prettier
than
as
she
stood
receiving
her
guests
in
the
pretty
green
silk
gown
trailing
with
seaweed
and
shimmering
with
silver
dust
her
curly
golden
hair
was
wreathed
with
soft
green
and
her
rosy
cheeks
and
dancing
eyes
made
her
look
like
a
mischievous
water
sprite
nan
own
costume
was
that
of
a
and
though
very
different
from
patty
it
had
all
the
picturesqueness
of
the
quaint
costume
of
the
breton
a
basket
slung
over
her
shoulder
held
fishes
and
nan
looked
quite
as
if
she
might
have
stepped
out
of
the
frame
of
a
picture
in
the
french
academy
fairfield
not
without
some
difficulty
had
been
induced
to
represent
neptune
false
flowing
white
hair
and
beard
a
shining
crown
and
trident
and
a
voluminous
robe
made
him
a
gorgeous
sight
the
three
stood
near
the
north
pole
to
receive
their
guests
and
formality
was
almost
lost
sight
of
in
the
hilarity
caused
by
the
procession
of
picturesque
costumes
there
were
pirates
of
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
mien
there
were
jolly
jack
tars
and
natty
ship
officers
there
were
water
babies
mermaids
fishermen
and
many
dainty
yachting
costumes
then
there
were
queer
and
grotesque
figures
such
as
a
frog
a
lobster
and
a
huge
crab
altogether
the
motley
procession
presented
a
most
interesting
appearance
and
patty
was
glad
when
the
guests
had
all
arrived
and
she
could
leave
her
post
and
mingle
with
the
crowd
it
was
not
long
before
a
group
of
patty
most
intimate
friends
had
gathered
on
the
upper
deck
to
chat
patty
herself
had
been
snugly
tucked
into
a
deck
chair
by
kenneth
who
insisted
on
showing
her
just
how
the
proceeding
should
be
accomplished
nothing
shows
your
ignorance
my
child
on
board
ship
he
was
saying
like
not
knowing
how
to
manage
your
steamer
rug
and
pillow
but
said
patty
i
shall
then
have
on
a
suitable
gown
that
will
stand
rough
usage
but
i
beg
of
you
ken
stop
tucking
that
rug
around
my
delicate
kelpie
decorations
oh
said
kenneth
you
a
kelpie
then
strange
i
did
recognise
you
at
once
but
i
so
rarely
meet
kelpies
in
the
best
society
now
captain
kidd
are
you
cried
elise
gaily
now
i
had
an
idea
you
were
admiral
farragut
but
then
one
so
rarely
meets
captain
kidd
in
the
best
society
that
so
said
kenneth
and
think
how
long
it
will
be
girls
before
you
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
this
particular
captain
kidd
in
any
society
i
tell
you
i
envy
you
you
going
to
have
the
time
of
your
life
in
paris
and
i
wish
to
goodness
i
could
go
along
with
you
oh
do
kenneth
cried
patty
we
have
just
the
best
time
ever
ca
you
give
up
college
and
put
in
a
lot
of
study
over
there
no
indeed
i
ca
i
only
just
wishing
i
could
there
no
harm
in
wishing
you
know
but
if
you
stay
until
next
summer
perhaps
come
over
and
see
you
during
vacation
and
then
we
can
all
come
home
together
that
would
be
fine
said
elise
and
we
just
as
likely
to
stay
until
summer
as
not
but
then
on
the
other
hand
we
just
as
likely
to
come
home
as
soon
as
we
get
there
you
never
can
tell
what
those
absurd
parents
of
mine
are
going
to
do
meantime
a
figure
was
walking
across
the
upper
deck
toward
the
group
that
surrounded
patty
it
was
impossible
not
to
recognise
the
character
which
was
meant
to
be
a
representation
of
noah
but
it
was
the
noah
of
the
children
noah
ark
and
the
tightly
fitting
brown
garment
with
yellow
buttons
down
the
front
was
exactly
like
the
patriarch
as
shown
in
the
wooden
toys
a
flat
hat
sat
squarely
on
his
head
and
as
he
held
his
arms
straight
down
at
his
side
and
as
his
cheeks
bore
little
round
daubs
of
red
paint
hepworth
was
exactly
like
a
gigantic
specimen
of
the
nursery
noah
he
came
across
the
deck
with
a
staggering
uncertain
motion
as
if
the
ship
were
rolling
and
pitching
about
his
realistic
acting
made
them
all
laugh
and
when
he
dropped
into
a
deck
chair
and
calling
the
steward
asked
faintly
for
a
cup
of
weak
tea
patty
declared
she
believed
she
would
go
to
paris
after
all
for
i
sure
she
said
that
i
do
want
to
go
wabbling
across
a
deck
and
looking
as
ill
and
woebegone
as
you
do
hepworth
smiled
at
her
you
have
so
many
remedies
and
preventives
given
you
he
said
and
you
be
so
busy
pitching
them
overboard
that
you
wo
have
time
to
be
seasick
really
i
believe
you
think
of
such
a
thing
all
the
way
over
let
alone
experiencing
it
you
a
great
comfort
said
patty
heartily
you
always
tell
me
the
most
comforting
things
now
everybody
else
declares
that
after
been
at
sea
for
a
day
i
be
so
ill
that
i
wo
care
whether
i
live
or
die
nonsense
declared
hepworth
do
pay
any
attention
to
such
croakings
i
agree
with
you
said
elise
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
not
going
to
be
seasick
but
i
going
to
have
a
perfectly
jolly
time
all
the
way
across
of
course
you
have
jolly
times
said
marian
who
was
in
one
of
her
doleful
moods
but
think
of
us
who
are
left
behind
we
wo
have
any
jolly
time
until
you
come
back
again
oh
i
do
know
said
kenneth
of
course
i
devoted
to
these
two
girls
but
i
not
going
to
let
it
blight
my
young
existence
and
crush
my
whole
career
just
because
i
have
to
live
without
them
for
six
months
but
you
do
love
patty
as
i
do
said
marian
with
a
sigh
as
she
gazed
at
her
adored
cousin
no
marian
i
do
said
kenneth
not
as
you
do
for
i
assume
that
you
love
her
as
a
first
cousin
now
my
affection
for
patty
is
more
on
the
order
of
a
grandmother
once
removed
you
ca
be
too
careful
about
the
exact
type
of
attachment
you
feel
for
a
young
lady
and
i
think
that
expresses
my
regard
for
patty
now
toward
elise
i
feel
more
like
a
great
niece
uncle
there
is
a
very
subtle
distinction
between
the
two
but
i
know
that
both
girls
are
acutely
aware
of
the
exact
kind
and
degree
of
my
regard
for
them
i
am
anyway
said
patty
and
i
must
say
ken
that
it
much
easier
to
leave
you
with
that
definite
affection
of
yours
than
it
is
to
go
away
from
marian
and
leave
her
floundering
in
her
deep
and
somewhat
damp
woe
marian
vouchsafed
a
sad
sort
of
smile
and
said
it
was
all
very
well
for
them
to
make
fun
of
her
but
she
could
help
missing
patty
nobody
can
help
missing
patty
declared
hepworth
and
for
my
part
if
i
find
that
i
miss
her
very
much
i
shall
go
straight
over
to
paris
and
bring
her
back
i
hope
you
will
cried
patty
that
is
i
hope
you
come
over
and
perhaps
we
can
persuade
you
not
to
be
in
such
a
dreadful
hurry
to
come
back
i
had
expected
to
run
over
in
the
early
spring
anyway
said
hepworth
carelessly
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
moment
i
want
to
do
certain
french
sketches
that
i
had
my
mind
on
for
some
time
well
if
you
do
come
said
elise
cordially
come
right
to
our
house
and
i
know
we
can
put
you
up
the
farringtons
are
erratic
but
always
hospitable
and
i
hereby
invite
this
whole
crowd
to
visit
us
in
paris
either
jointly
or
severally
whenever
the
spirit
moves
you
if
i
find
a
spirit
that
can
move
me
over
to
paris
i
shall
come
often
declared
kenneth
but
i
afraid
i
too
substantially
built
to
be
wafted
across
the
ocean
in
the
clutches
of
any
spirit
just
then
the
notes
of
a
bugle
sounded
clear
and
sweet
from
below
that
the
ship
bugler
declared
hepworth
and
that
the
bugle
call
for
supper
shall
we
go
down
and
refresh
ourselves
yes
indeed
cried
patty
jumping
from
her
nest
of
steamer
rugs
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
but
it
somehow
happened
that
all
of
the
gay
young
crowd
left
the
upper
deck
to
go
to
the
supper
room
before
patty
and
hepworth
started
he
detained
her
for
a
moment
while
he
said
little
girl
will
you
miss
me
while
you
away
even
if
i
expected
to
i
would
own
up
to
it
said
patty
as
she
gave
him
a
mischievous
glance
why
would
you
own
up
to
it
hepworth
spoke
quite
seriously
and
looked
intently
at
the
pretty
face
before
him
with
its
golden
hair
crowned
by
the
shining
green
i
do
know
said
patty
slowly
she
felt
herself
forced
by
his
impelling
gaze
to
raise
her
eyes
to
his
and
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
her
that
hepworth
felt
more
interest
in
her
than
she
had
ever
suspected
i
do
know
why
i
would
own
up
to
it
sure
she
went
on
in
fact
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
believe
i
should
own
up
to
it
well
own
it
then
tell
me
you
will
miss
me
and
will
sometimes
wish
i
might
be
with
you
oh
cried
patty
laughing
merrily
i
only
meant
i
would
own
it
if
it
were
true
of
course
i
really
miss
you
there
be
so
much
to
amuse
and
interest
me
that
i
have
time
to
miss
anybody
except
papa
and
nan
that
just
what
i
thought
said
hepworth
chapter
v
at
last
the
day
of
sailing
came
the
steamer
was
to
leave
her
dock
at
three
on
saturday
afternoon
and
soon
after
two
patty
went
on
board
accompanied
by
nan
and
her
father
a
crowd
of
friends
had
also
gathered
to
bid
patty
goodspeed
and
besides
these
the
farringtons
had
many
friends
there
to
say
to
them
with
the
exception
of
marian
it
was
not
a
sad
parting
indeed
it
seemed
rather
a
hilarious
occasion
than
otherwise
this
was
partly
because
most
of
the
persons
concerned
felt
truly
sorry
to
miss
bright
presence
out
of
their
lives
and
feared
that
if
they
showed
any
regret
the
situation
might
become
too
much
for
them
hilda
and
lorraine
felt
this
especially
and
they
were
so
absurdly
gay
that
it
was
quite
clear
to
patty
that
their
gaiety
was
assumed
but
she
was
grateful
to
them
for
it
for
as
she
had
previously
confided
to
nan
she
did
want
a
weepy
teary
crowd
to
bid
her
she
wanted
to
go
away
amid
laughter
and
smiles
as
the
brief
hour
before
sailing
passed
more
and
more
people
came
to
see
them
off
and
patty
began
to
think
that
everybody
she
ever
knew
would
be
there
many
of
the
friends
brought
gifts
and
many
had
already
sent
fruit
or
flowers
both
to
the
farringtons
and
to
patty
down
in
the
a
whole
table
was
occupied
with
the
gifts
to
their
party
and
more
than
a
fair
proportion
of
these
belonged
to
patty
she
was
quite
bewildered
for
sailing
away
from
her
native
land
was
a
new
experience
to
her
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
include
this
elaborate
profusion
of
farewell
gifts
there
was
a
great
basket
of
red
roses
from
winthrop
warner
and
bertha
had
sent
a
box
of
candy
roger
had
sent
candy
too
and
kenneth
had
sent
a
beautiful
basket
of
fruit
that
seemed
to
include
every
known
variety
nor
were
the
gifts
only
from
patty
intimate
friends
she
was
surprised
to
learn
how
many
of
her
acquaintances
and
relatives
and
casual
friends
had
sent
a
token
of
good
wishes
for
her
voyage
the
truth
is
that
patty
was
a
general
favourite
and
made
friends
with
all
whom
she
met
hepworth
had
once
told
her
that
she
was
a
dispenser
of
happiness
if
so
she
was
now
reaping
the
reward
for
her
friends
had
surely
showered
happiness
upon
her
and
besides
the
table
full
of
gifts
there
were
many
letters
and
telegrams
in
the
ship
little
these
delighted
patty
too
and
she
laid
the
budget
aside
to
enjoy
after
the
trip
had
fairly
begun
among
the
last
to
arrive
was
hepworth
he
brought
no
fruit
or
flowers
but
he
was
followed
by
a
messenger
boy
fairly
staggering
under
the
weight
of
his
burden
i
knew
patty
he
said
that
you
have
all
the
flowers
and
fruit
and
sweets
you
could
possibly
want
so
i
brought
you
a
different
kind
of
gift
there
seems
to
be
plenty
of
it
said
patty
as
she
looked
at
the
small
boy
his
arms
were
full
of
papers
and
magazines
which
as
they
afterward
discovered
included
every
newspaper
magazine
and
weekly
periodical
published
in
new
york
you
know
said
hepworth
you
ca
get
current
reading
matter
after
you
start
and
a
good
deal
of
this
stuff
you
wo
find
in
paris
either
though
you
can
get
american
publications
there
more
easily
than
you
can
in
london
but
read
what
you
want
patty
and
pitch
the
rest
overboard
the
boy
was
directed
to
carry
his
load
to
patty
stateroom
and
deposit
it
there
patty
thanked
hepworth
for
his
thoughtful
gift
and
said
she
would
read
every
word
of
it
and
probably
carry
a
great
deal
of
it
ashore
with
her
come
on
patty
said
kenneth
we
going
to
see
where
your
deck
chairs
are
so
we
can
have
a
mental
picture
of
just
how
you
going
to
look
for
the
next
week
or
so
about
a
dozen
merry
young
people
trooped
up
the
next
deck
and
found
the
chairs
that
had
been
reserved
for
the
farrington
party
but
when
patty
saw
them
she
burst
out
laughing
the
two
that
were
intended
for
herself
and
elise
had
been
decorated
in
an
absurd
fashion
they
were
tied
with
ribbon
bows
and
bunches
and
garlands
of
flowers
they
were
filled
with
fancy
pillows
and
tied
on
in
several
places
were
letters
and
small
packages
done
up
in
paper
they
look
like
ridiculous
christmas
trees
cried
patty
i
crazy
to
open
those
bundles
for
i
know
they
full
of
foolishness
that
you
girls
have
rigged
up
for
us
do
open
them
now
said
hilda
for
we
have
to
leave
you
and
go
ashore
in
a
few
moments
now
patty
you
will
write
to
us
wo
you
i
rather
think
i
will
cried
patty
you
all
been
so
good
to
me
i
never
could
thank
you
enough
if
i
wrote
every
day
and
all
day
come
with
me
patty
said
kenneth
i
want
to
show
you
something
up
at
this
end
of
the
ship
so
patty
went
off
with
kenneth
and
when
they
were
well
away
from
the
laughing
crowd
he
drew
a
small
box
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
her
saying
patty
you
must
think
i
a
sentimental
fool
for
i
not
but
i
wish
you
wear
that
while
you
away
and
sometimes
think
of
me
patty
flashed
a
comical
glance
at
him
good
gracious
ken
she
exclaimed
it
an
awful
funny
thing
this
going
away
it
makes
all
your
friends
so
serious
and
so
afraid
forget
them
of
course
i
shall
think
of
you
while
i
away
who
else
has
been
asking
you
to
think
of
him
growled
kenneth
that
ridiculous
hepworth
i
suppose
well
now
look
here
miss
you
to
think
of
me
twice
to
his
once
do
you
understand
that
yes
i
understand
said
patty
demurely
and
now
may
i
look
in
the
box
before
i
promise
to
wear
your
gift
it
might
be
a
live
beetle
i
saw
a
lady
once
who
wore
a
live
beetle
attached
to
a
tiny
gold
chain
oh
it
was
awful
it
is
a
live
beetle
said
kenneth
smiling
but
it
is
attached
to
a
tiny
gold
chain
yes
of
course
you
may
look
at
it
and
if
you
like
it
you
need
wear
it
so
patty
opened
the
box
and
discovered
a
little
gold
locket
set
with
tiny
pearls
and
hanging
from
a
slender
gold
chain
it
was
very
graceful
and
dainty
and
patty
first
impulse
was
one
of
delight
but
as
she
looked
up
and
met
kenneth
serious
gaze
she
suddenly
wondered
if
she
were
promising
too
much
to
say
she
would
wear
it
what
inside
of
it
she
inquired
as
if
to
gain
time
look
and
see
patty
opened
the
locket
and
found
it
contained
a
most
attractive
picture
of
kenneth
handsome
boyish
face
what
a
splendid
likeness
she
exclaimed
you
awfully
ken
and
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
wear
the
locket
with
pleasure
sometimes
you
know
not
all
the
time
of
course
until
i
find
somebody
who
is
handsomer
than
you
or
whom
i
like
better
pooh
cried
kenneth
i
do
care
how
often
you
replace
it
with
a
picture
of
a
handsomer
man
but
patty
i
do
want
you
to
find
any
one
you
like
better
promise
me
you
wo
oh
i
ca
promise
that
ken
just
think
of
the
fascinating
frenchmen
i
shall
probably
meet
with
their
waxed
moustaches
and
their
dandified
manners
how
can
i
help
liking
them
better
than
a
plain
unvarnished
american
boy
all
right
my
lady
if
you
set
your
affections
on
a
french
popinjay
i
come
over
there
and
fight
a
duel
with
him
i
know
you
too
sensible
to
look
at
those
dandies
but
i
wish
you
promise
not
to
like
anybody
better
than
this
plain
unvarnished
american
boy
i
wo
promise
you
anything
ken
said
patty
not
unkindly
but
with
a
gentle
definite
air
i
thank
you
for
your
locket
it
is
beautiful
and
i
do
love
pretty
things
i
wear
it
sometimes
let
me
see
is
saturday
well
i
wear
it
every
saturday
that
will
insure
your
being
thought
of
at
least
once
a
week
and
with
this
kenneth
had
to
be
content
for
a
roguish
laugh
appeared
in
patty
eyes
and
he
knew
she
would
not
treat
matters
seriously
any
further
dropping
the
locket
in
her
little
handbag
patty
turned
to
go
back
to
the
others
but
you
not
keeping
your
promise
said
kenneth
detaining
her
what
promise
you
said
you
wear
the
locket
on
saturdays
and
is
saturday
patty
was
a
little
embarrassed
she
knew
if
she
went
back
to
the
group
with
the
trinket
hanging
round
her
neck
every
one
would
know
at
once
that
kenneth
had
given
it
to
her
and
they
would
surmise
far
more
than
the
simple
truth
and
she
was
especially
conscious
that
hepworth
would
notice
it
and
would
think
it
meant
all
kenneth
had
wanted
it
to
mean
which
was
far
more
than
she
had
accepted
it
as
meaning
kenneth
saw
her
hesitation
and
stood
watching
her
wear
it
dear
he
said
quietly
an
old
friend
like
myself
has
a
perfect
right
to
give
you
a
little
keepsake
then
patty
had
an
inspiration
she
clasped
the
little
chain
about
her
neck
and
then
tucked
the
locket
down
inside
her
collar
so
that
it
was
entirely
out
of
sight
you
little
witch
cried
kenneth
as
she
raised
her
laughing
eyes
to
his
but
at
any
rate
you
wearing
it
and
that
all
i
asked
of
you
yes
said
patty
and
as
gaily
and
unaffectedly
as
a
child
she
grasped
kenneth
hand
and
ran
down
the
long
deck
to
join
the
others
although
determined
to
ignore
the
episode
patty
cheeks
bore
a
heightened
colour
and
she
let
poor
kenneth
severely
alone
devoting
her
attention
to
the
others
but
it
was
nearly
time
for
the
last
farewell
to
be
said
and
indeed
some
of
the
party
had
said
and
left
the
steamer
and
then
again
patty
was
carried
off
for
a
little
confidential
talk
at
the
other
end
of
the
deck
and
this
time
it
was
by
her
father
he
seemed
to
have
many
final
bits
of
advice
to
give
her
regarding
the
minutiae
of
her
journey
her
money
matters
her
relation
toward
the
farringtons
and
her
correct
demeanour
in
many
ways
i
not
at
all
afraid
to
trust
you
out
of
my
sight
patty
girl
he
said
for
i
have
absolute
faith
in
your
common
sense
and
your
good
judgment
i
know
you
wo
do
anything
wrong
or
unladylike
but
i
want
to
warn
you
my
little
girl
not
to
get
mixed
up
in
any
romantic
adventures
you
altogether
too
young
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
warn
you
i
allow
you
to
be
engaged
to
anybody
for
years
and
years
to
come
patty
laughed
merrily
at
this
indeed
papa
she
said
nothing
is
further
from
my
mind
than
any
such
performance
as
you
suggest
and
i
have
the
slightest
desire
to
think
of
being
engaged
until
i
at
least
as
old
as
nan
and
anyway
i
do
believe
anybody
would
like
me
well
enough
to
want
to
be
engaged
to
me
oh
that
is
unless
it
might
be
kenneth
and
then
patty
told
her
father
the
whole
story
of
kenneth
and
the
locket
you
did
just
right
patty
said
her
father
kenneth
is
a
nice
boy
but
he
is
altogether
too
young
and
you
are
too
to
attach
any
sentimental
significance
to
his
gift
wear
the
locket
if
you
want
to
or
when
you
want
to
but
let
it
be
understood
that
it
means
nothing
more
than
the
merest
friendly
keepsake
yes
that
just
what
i
think
said
patty
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
at
this
prosaic
settlement
of
the
subject
oh
papa
you
the
only
one
i
going
to
miss
very
much
you
and
nan
but
especially
you
i
know
it
my
girl
we
have
been
a
great
deal
to
each
other
all
these
years
and
of
course
we
shall
miss
each
other
but
the
time
will
soon
pass
away
and
since
we
have
to
part
we
must
be
brave
about
it
and
we
must
not
spoil
the
happiness
of
it
by
the
sorrow
of
it
dear
papa
said
patty
squeezing
his
hand
you
are
always
so
wise
and
good
that
just
the
point
we
must
not
spoil
the
happiness
by
the
sorrow
though
that
is
what
marian
is
always
trying
to
do
poor
marian
she
such
a
pathetic
creature
i
wish
she
would
cheer
up
i
think
she
will
patty
nan
and
i
are
going
to
take
her
home
with
us
and
keep
her
for
a
fortnight
or
more
and
we
make
her
so
gay
that
she
forget
you
gone
good
for
you
papa
that
lovely
you
do
think
of
the
nicest
things
for
people
well
now
chickabiddy
i
suppose
i
have
to
leave
you
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
a
spirit
of
cheerfulness
stick
to
your
sense
of
proportion
and
your
sense
of
humor
remember
that
the
time
will
soon
pass
and
pass
happily
too
and
then
you
come
sailing
back
to
this
very
dock
and
i
be
here
waiting
for
you
they
rejoined
the
group
and
then
the
farewells
began
in
earnest
patty
was
embraced
and
kissed
by
all
the
girls
until
nan
declared
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
her
to
say
to
the
men
shook
hands
and
expressed
hearty
good
wishes
and
with
one
last
kiss
from
her
father
patty
was
left
alone
with
the
farringtons
as
the
steamer
sailed
away
there
was
much
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
flags
and
the
friends
on
shore
were
kept
in
sight
just
as
long
as
possible
but
when
they
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
patty
said
come
on
elise
let
do
something
to
occupy
our
minds
or
i
feel
sure
i
shall
cry
like
a
baby
in
spite
of
my
noble
and
brave
resolutions
all
right
said
elise
i
with
you
let
go
down
and
put
things
to
rights
in
our
stateroom
so
down
they
went
on
their
errand
the
girls
were
to
share
the
same
stateroom
and
as
it
was
large
and
conveniently
arranged
they
were
glad
to
be
together
but
as
they
entered
the
door
they
nearly
fell
over
in
astonishment
for
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
his
paws
extended
in
welcome
was
a
very
large
very
white
and
very
fleecy
teddy
bear
in
one
paw
he
held
a
card
on
which
was
written
oh
patty
dear
oh
elise
dear
we
do
want
you
to
go
away
but
if
you
will
keep
with
you
still
this
merry
little
stowaway
chapter
vi
the
old
the
girls
laughed
heartily
over
the
teddy
bear
and
agreed
that
it
was
a
delightful
companion
for
their
trip
elise
set
him
up
on
the
little
shelf
above
the
washstand
and
he
gazed
down
upon
them
like
a
fat
and
patron
saint
patty
named
him
yankee
doodle
and
gave
him
an
american
flag
to
hold
but
elise
not
wishing
to
seem
to
slight
the
french
nation
gave
him
a
silken
of
france
to
hold
in
his
other
paw
apparently
unprejudiced
in
his
sympathies
yankee
doodle
held
both
flags
and
continued
to
wear
his
jolly
and
complacent
grin
it
was
great
fun
for
the
girls
to
arrange
their
stateroom
as
they
expected
to
occupy
it
for
the
next
ten
days
they
proceeded
to
make
it
as
homelike
as
possible
they
both
had
so
many
cabin
bags
and
wall
pockets
and
basket
catchalls
which
had
been
parting
gifts
that
it
was
difficult
to
find
wall
space
for
them
all
patty
was
to
occupy
the
lower
berth
and
elise
the
wide
and
comfortable
sofa
for
they
concluded
they
could
chatter
better
if
on
a
level
this
left
the
upper
berth
as
a
broad
shelf
for
books
and
magazines
boxes
of
candy
and
all
the
odds
and
ends
of
their
belongings
is
it
perfectly
wonderful
said
patty
to
think
we
are
already
miles
away
from
land
and
dancing
away
over
this
blue
water
as
patty
was
standing
on
the
sofa
with
her
head
stuck
out
through
the
porthole
elise
could
not
hear
a
word
of
this
speech
so
unless
the
fishes
were
interested
it
was
entirely
lost
but
this
mattered
little
to
patty
and
soon
she
pulled
her
head
in
and
made
the
same
remark
over
again
well
said
elise
who
was
when
people
take
passage
on
an
ocean
steamer
they
often
expect
to
get
a
few
miles
away
from
land
after
they
start
oh
elise
cried
patty
have
you
no
imagination
of
course
it
wonderful
to
consider
the
fact
of
our
sailing
out
to
sea
but
the
idea
of
dancing
away
over
the
blue
water
is
poetic
and
therefore
wonderful
i
glad
you
explained
it
to
me
and
i
dare
say
the
more
the
ship
dances
the
more
wonderful
it
will
be
and
so
let
get
these
things
straightened
out
before
the
dancing
grows
mad
and
hilarious
all
right
said
patty
and
she
went
to
work
with
a
will
stowing
away
things
and
tacking
up
things
until
everything
was
snugly
in
place
farrington
maid
accompanied
the
party
but
both
elise
and
patty
being
energetic
young
americans
had
small
use
for
her
services
she
was
a
help
though
in
the
matter
of
back
buttons
and
hair
ribbons
and
she
came
now
rapping
at
the
stateroom
door
with
a
message
from
farrington
that
the
girls
were
to
dress
for
dinner
at
the
same
moment
the
pretty
rang
out
that
marked
the
half
hour
before
is
it
fun
cried
patty
to
have
the
a
trumpet
except
at
my
own
party
the
other
night
i
never
been
bugled
to
my
meals
what
shall
we
wear
elise
not
our
prettiest
dresses
we
must
save
those
for
the
concert
or
whatever
gaieties
they
may
have
put
on
that
blue
checked
silk
of
yours
patty
it
the
sweetest
thing
and
just
right
for
dinner
and
i
wear
my
light
green
one
with
slight
assistance
from
lisette
the
french
maid
they
were
soon
ready
patty
envied
lisette
her
fluency
in
the
french
tongue
for
though
all
the
officers
on
board
and
most
of
the
passengers
spoke
english
patty
wished
she
could
talk
french
more
readily
than
she
did
she
found
it
good
practice
to
talk
to
lisette
in
her
own
language
as
the
mistakes
she
made
did
not
embarrass
her
lisette
of
course
was
a
great
admirer
of
pretty
patty
and
was
only
too
glad
to
be
of
assistance
to
her
linguistically
or
any
other
way
another
announced
dinner
and
joining
and
farrington
the
girls
went
down
to
the
dining
saloon
their
seats
were
at
the
captain
table
and
patty
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
profusion
of
beautiful
flowers
as
graced
the
board
the
stewards
had
placed
the
flowers
of
all
the
passengers
upon
the
tables
and
with
the
lights
and
ornate
decorations
of
the
louis
xvi
saloon
it
was
like
fairyland
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
elaborately
decorated
in
dainty
french
fashion
and
the
table
service
was
exceedingly
attractive
patty
was
much
amused
at
the
revolving
chair
which
she
had
to
learn
how
to
get
into
but
after
being
twirled
to
her
place
she
concluded
it
was
a
wise
provision
for
a
of
such
uncertain
level
farrington
sat
at
the
captain
right
hand
and
next
to
her
was
her
husband
then
elise
and
then
patty
patty
at
once
began
to
wonder
who
would
occupy
the
chair
next
beyond
herself
and
was
exceedingly
interested
when
the
steward
turned
it
around
to
accommodate
a
lady
who
was
approaching
the
newcomer
was
without
doubt
a
frenchwoman
somewhat
elderly
but
very
vigorous
and
active
she
had
masses
of
hair
and
large
alert
black
eyes
that
seemed
to
dart
quickly
from
one
point
of
interest
to
another
she
was
a
little
lady
but
her
gait
and
manner
were
marked
by
an
air
not
only
of
aristocracy
but
as
of
one
accustomed
to
exert
absolute
authority
nor
was
she
apparently
of
a
mild
and
amiable
disposition
she
spoke
sharply
to
the
steward
although
he
was
doing
his
best
to
serve
her
and
is
it
that
you
shall
be
all
night
in
arranging
my
chair
she
exclaimed
then
as
she
was
finally
seated
she
continued
her
grumbling
and
is
it
not
enough
that
i
must
be
delayed
but
still
i
have
received
no
menu
one
shall
see
if
this
is
to
be
permitted
the
steward
did
not
seem
unduly
alarmed
at
the
little
old
lady
angry
speech
but
hastened
to
bring
her
the
daintily
printed
bill
of
fare
raising
her
jewelled
lorgnon
the
french
lady
scanned
the
menu
and
having
made
a
choice
of
soup
she
laid
the
card
down
and
turning
toward
patty
surveyed
her
leisurely
through
her
glasses
her
manner
as
she
scrutinised
patty
was
by
no
means
rude
or
impertinent
it
had
rather
the
effect
of
an
honest
curiosity
and
a
polite
interest
there
is
no
denying
my
dear
she
said
at
last
that
you
are
of
a
beauty
and
of
a
sweetness
an
american
of
americans
new
york
is
it
not
so
there
was
an
indefinable
charm
about
the
old
lady
manner
that
won
patty
heart
at
once
and
though
in
any
case
she
would
have
been
polite
she
answered
with
cordiality
yes
madame
i
live
in
new
york
although
i
was
born
in
the
south
and
lived
there
for
many
years
ah
then
it
is
explained
it
is
your
southern
states
that
make
the
charm
the
aplomb
without
the
what
you
call
the
the
freshness
is
it
not
so
but
i
do
not
mean
the
freshness
of
the
cheek
and
yet
in
the
argot
do
you
not
say
freshness
is
cheek
ah
i
am
bewildered
i
am
mixup
with
your
strange
words
but
i
will
learn
them
they
shall
not
conquer
me
and
you
will
help
me
is
it
not
so
i
will
help
you
with
pleasure
madame
replied
patty
dimpling
with
fun
as
she
heard
the
old
lady
unsuccessful
attempts
in
american
slang
my
name
is
patty
fairfield
and
though
i
seldom
use
the
slang
of
my
country
i
more
or
less
familiar
with
its
terms
and
can
enlighten
you
concerning
them
at
least
to
a
degree
to
me
your
language
is
difficult
but
perhaps
we
may
by
conversation
help
each
other
patty
fairfield
a
pleasant
name
for
a
pleasant
child
but
i
not
madame
pray
call
me
i
am
labesse
you
are
a
frenchwoman
of
course
inquired
patty
a
frenchwoman
yes
but
of
an
admiration
for
your
strange
american
country
i
go
home
now
but
i
shall
return
again
your
country
is
of
an
interest
as
patty
looked
around
at
the
others
at
their
table
she
felt
that
she
had
been
fortunate
in
sitting
next
to
the
old
for
though
she
could
not
judge
entirely
by
appearances
no
one
else
at
the
table
seemed
to
be
so
quaintly
interesting
as
the
old
french
lady
patty
soon
discovered
that
even
a
few
miles
of
dancing
upon
the
blue
water
had
decidedly
sharpened
her
appetite
and
she
did
full
justice
to
the
delicate
viands
and
delicious
french
cookery
placed
before
her
she
and
elise
chatted
happily
and
after
introducing
her
companions
on
either
side
to
each
other
the
conversation
became
general
under
the
influence
of
the
comradeship
always
felt
on
a
french
liner
the
people
across
the
table
became
sociably
inclined
and
acquaintances
were
made
rapidly
after
dinner
our
party
went
out
on
deck
and
though
warm
wraps
were
necessary
the
crisp
clear
air
was
delightful
and
the
starry
sky
and
tumbling
black
water
fascinated
patty
beyond
all
words
she
leaned
against
the
rail
watching
the
waves
as
they
dashed
and
plashed
below
breaking
into
white
foam
as
the
steamer
ploughed
through
them
patty
was
very
susceptible
to
new
impressions
and
the
great
expanse
of
black
water
beneath
the
dome
of
the
black
sky
filled
her
with
an
awe
and
reverence
which
she
had
never
known
before
elise
stood
quietly
beside
her
with
her
hand
through
patty
arm
and
together
the
girls
silently
enjoyed
the
sombre
beauty
of
the
scene
are
you
afraid
patty
asked
elise
patty
laughed
a
little
and
then
she
said
i
do
know
as
i
can
make
you
understand
it
elise
for
it
sounds
so
ridiculous
when
it
put
into
words
but
it
this
way
with
me
in
my
imagination
when
i
think
of
this
little
cockleshell
of
a
boat
tossing
on
this
great
deep
black
ocean
which
may
engulf
it
at
any
moment
i
have
a
certain
feeling
of
fear
which
seems
to
belong
to
the
situation
but
really
my
common
sense
tells
me
that
these
staunch
steamships
are
constructed
for
the
very
purpose
of
carrying
people
safely
across
the
sea
and
that
there
is
almost
no
danger
at
all
of
their
doing
otherwise
so
you
see
it
only
depends
on
whether
i
in
a
mood
of
poetical
imagination
or
practical
common
sense
as
to
whether
i
afraid
or
not
patty
said
elise
with
a
little
sigh
you
are
certainly
clever
now
i
never
could
have
reasoned
the
thing
out
like
that
and
yet
i
see
just
what
you
mean
throw
bouquets
at
yourself
then
elise
said
patty
laughing
for
you
a
great
deal
more
clever
to
see
what
i
mean
than
i
am
to
say
it
after
a
brisk
walk
up
and
down
the
deck
for
a
time
the
girls
tucked
themselves
snugly
into
their
deck
chairs
by
the
side
of
the
elder
farringtons
how
do
you
like
it
so
far
patty
asked
farrington
it
simply
perfect
declared
patty
enthusiastically
it
awfully
different
from
what
i
thought
it
would
be
and
ever
so
much
nicer
i
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
walk
across
the
deck
without
tumbling
all
over
and
catching
hold
of
everything
but
we
can
walk
around
just
as
if
in
a
house
and
everything
is
comfortable
even
luxurious
and
it
all
so
clean
farrington
laughed
at
this
of
course
it
clean
child
she
said
it
only
on
land
that
we
are
under
the
tyranny
of
dust
and
dirt
but
as
for
tumbling
around
the
deck
that
may
come
later
imagine
the
sea
is
never
rougher
than
it
is
i
hope
it
will
be
rougher
said
patty
i
do
want
a
fearful
storm
but
i
would
like
a
little
pitching
and
tossing
you
probably
get
it
said
farrington
and
now
my
cherished
ones
let
us
take
a
look
in
at
the
library
and
and
then
let
us
seek
our
staterooms
so
the
parry
adjourned
to
the
brilliantly
lighted
saloon
where
many
of
the
passengers
had
congregated
to
spend
the
hour
it
was
a
beautiful
apartment
even
more
gorgeous
and
elaborate
than
the
and
furnished
with
sofas
and
divans
of
puffy
upholstery
tables
were
scattered
about
for
the
benefit
of
the
and
attractively
appointed
made
patty
suddenly
realise
that
she
wanted
to
write
letters
home
at
once
but
remembering
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
mailed
for
ten
days
to
come
she
decided
to
defer
them
at
least
until
the
morrow
bookcases
attracted
the
girls
attention
and
notwithstanding
the
large
amount
of
reading
matter
they
had
of
their
own
they
were
glad
to
see
some
favourites
behind
the
glass
doors
patty
was
surprised
when
farrington
proposed
that
they
should
all
go
to
the
for
a
bit
of
supper
before
retiring
it
seemed
to
her
but
a
short
time
since
they
had
dined
and
yet
she
realised
the
suggestion
was
not
entirely
unwelcome
is
it
imperative
that
we
shall
eat
more
meals
on
sea
than
on
land
she
inquired
as
they
took
their
places
at
the
table
not
imperative
perhaps
the
captain
answered
her
smiling
but
unless
you
seem
to
appreciate
my
cook
efforts
to
please
you
i
shall
have
to
pitch
him
overboard
and
it
is
not
easy
to
find
another
chef
in
then
said
patty
gaily
i
shall
certainly
do
all
i
can
to
save
the
poor
man
from
a
dreadful
fate
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
i
shall
have
any
difficulty
in
keeping
my
part
of
the
bargain
as
patty
spoke
she
was
nibbling
away
with
great
satisfaction
at
a
caviare
sandwich
and
bestowing
a
pleased
glance
on
a
glass
of
orange
sherbet
which
the
steward
had
just
brought
to
her
the
captain
was
a
large
and
personage
with
the
black
moustache
and
imperiale
of
the
true
frenchman
his
manner
was
expansive
and
very
cordial
and
as
he
had
known
the
farringtons
for
many
years
he
was
quite
ready
to
welcome
patty
for
their
sake
as
well
as
her
own
indeed
he
had
taken
an
immediate
liking
to
the
pretty
american
girl
and
as
french
captains
are
prone
to
make
favourites
among
their
passengers
patty
was
immediately
assigned
in
his
chivalrous
heart
to
such
a
position
he
bade
her
a
pleasant
as
she
left
the
and
was
delighted
with
her
naive
expressions
of
admiration
and
appreciation
of
his
beautiful
ship
when
the
girls
reached
their
stateroom
they
suddenly
realised
that
they
were
quite
tired
out
after
the
excitements
of
the
day
and
were
very
glad
to
let
lisette
brush
their
hair
and
assist
them
in
preparing
for
bed
as
patty
nestled
snugly
between
the
coarse
linen
sheets
she
felt
a
drowsy
enjoyment
of
the
gentle
rolling
motion
of
the
steamer
and
almost
immediately
fell
into
a
sound
dreamless
sleep
chapter
vii
western
friends
the
girls
slept
restfully
all
night
and
were
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
entrance
of
lisette
who
was
followed
by
the
and
voluble
french
stewardess
the
day
was
bright
and
sunshiny
and
half
a
dozen
times
while
she
was
dressing
patty
stuck
her
head
out
of
the
porthole
to
gaze
at
the
sparkling
blue
water
on
these
occasions
elise
grasped
her
by
the
feet
lest
she
should
fall
out
but
as
substantial
frame
could
not
possibly
have
squeezed
through
the
porthole
the
precaution
was
unnecessary
after
breakfast
the
girls
prepared
for
a
delightful
morning
on
deck
the
breeze
had
freshened
considerably
so
patty
put
on
a
long
warm
ulster
that
enveloped
her
from
throat
to
feet
a
long
blue
veil
tied
her
trim
little
hat
in
place
and
when
fully
equipped
she
looked
over
the
piles
of
literature
to
make
a
selection
do
you
know
she
said
to
elise
i
do
believe
i
shall
read
much
i
think
i
shall
just
sit
and
look
at
the
water
and
dream
all
right
said
her
practical
friend
but
take
a
book
with
you
for
if
you
do
you
sure
to
want
one
while
if
you
do
you
probably
wo
look
at
it
elise
you
a
genius
i
take
the
book
and
also
some
of
this
candy
i
glad
hilda
gave
me
this
bag
it
most
convenient
the
bag
in
question
was
a
large
plain
affair
of
dark
green
cloth
with
a
black
ribbon
drawstring
it
proved
to
be
patty
constant
companion
as
it
was
roomy
enough
to
hold
gloves
veils
handkerchiefs
as
well
as
pencil
and
paper
and
anything
else
they
might
need
through
the
day
it
hung
conveniently
on
the
back
of
patty
deck
chair
and
became
as
famous
as
the
bag
of
the
lady
in
swiss
family
robinson
as
patty
had
anticipated
she
did
not
do
any
reading
that
morning
but
neither
did
she
gaze
at
the
ocean
and
dream
she
discovered
that
life
on
an
ocean
steamer
is
apt
to
be
full
of
incident
and
abounds
in
occupation
no
sooner
had
she
and
elise
arranged
themselves
in
their
chairs
than
along
came
two
gay
and
laughing
girls
who
stopped
to
talk
to
them
we
going
to
introduce
ourselves
said
one
of
them
i
am
alicia
van
ness
and
this
is
my
little
sister
doris
we
from
chicago
and
we
like
the
looks
of
you
girls
and
we
want
to
be
chums
though
of
course
it
up
to
you
and
if
you
do
like
our
looks
you
only
to
say
so
and
we
never
trouble
you
again
speak
out
chimed
in
the
other
girl
who
was
quite
as
vivacious
as
her
sister
we
not
a
bit
stupid
and
we
can
take
the
slightest
hint
i
can
see
you
do
quite
approve
of
us
and
she
looked
shrewdly
at
patty
who
had
unconsciously
assumed
an
air
of
hauteur
as
she
watched
the
western
girls
but
really
and
truly
awfully
nice
after
you
get
acquainted
with
us
patty
was
amused
and
a
little
ashamed
that
a
stranger
should
have
read
her
feelings
so
accurately
for
she
had
felt
slightly
repelled
at
the
somewhat
forward
manners
of
these
friends
as
if
to
make
up
for
her
coolness
she
said
heartily
i
sure
you
are
delightful
to
know
and
i
quite
ready
to
be
friends
if
you
will
allow
it
i
patty
fairfield
and
this
is
my
chum
elise
farrington
we
knew
your
names
said
alicia
van
ness
we
asked
the
captain
you
see
we
thought
you
two
were
the
nicest
girls
on
board
but
if
you
had
thrown
us
down
we
were
going
to
tackle
the
english
girl
next
though
this
slangy
style
of
talk
was
not
at
all
to
patty
liking
she
saw
no
reason
to
reject
the
offered
friendship
because
of
it
the
van
ness
sisters
might
prove
to
be
interesting
companions
in
spite
of
their
unconventional
ways
so
two
vacant
chairs
were
drawn
up
and
the
four
girls
sat
in
a
group
and
very
soon
were
chatting
away
like
old
friends
do
you
know
the
english
girl
asked
doris
she
sits
at
your
table
no
said
elise
she
way
down
at
the
other
end
from
us
but
i
like
her
looks
only
she
so
very
english
that
i
expect
she
rather
stiff
and
hard
to
get
acquainted
with
you
ca
say
that
about
us
can
you
said
alicia
laughing
i
as
easy
as
an
old
shoe
and
doris
as
an
old
slipper
but
we
hope
like
us
because
we
do
love
to
be
liked
that
english
girl
name
is
florrie
nash
is
that
queer
she
does
look
a
bit
like
a
florrie
does
she
more
like
a
susan
or
a
hannah
or
more
like
a
catharine
or
elizabeth
i
think
said
patty
but
you
never
can
tell
people
names
from
what
they
look
like
no
said
alicia
now
a
stranger
would
say
you
looked
like
my
name
and
i
looked
like
yours
that
true
enough
said
elise
laughing
your
jolly
ways
are
not
at
all
like
your
name
and
as
for
patty
here
it
a
perfect
shame
to
spoil
her
beautiful
name
of
patricia
by
such
a
nickname
two
young
men
in
long
plaid
ulsters
with
collars
and
plaid
yachting
caps
came
into
view
at
the
other
end
of
the
deck
they
were
walking
with
swinging
strides
in
the
direction
of
the
group
of
girls
now
i
show
you
said
alicia
in
a
low
voice
how
we
chicago
girls
scrape
acquaintance
with
young
men
as
the
young
men
drew
nearer
alicia
looked
at
them
smilingly
and
said
ahem
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
the
young
men
looked
at
her
and
smiled
whereupon
doris
purposely
dropped
a
book
she
had
been
holding
the
young
men
sprang
to
pick
it
up
doris
took
it
and
thanked
them
and
then
made
a
further
remark
as
to
the
beauty
of
the
weather
the
young
men
replied
affably
and
then
alicia
asked
them
to
join
their
group
and
sit
down
for
a
chat
with
pleasure
said
one
of
the
young
men
glancing
at
patty
and
elise
if
we
may
be
allowed
patty
was
surprised
and
shocked
at
the
behaviour
of
these
strange
girls
and
very
decidedly
expressed
her
opinion
in
her
face
without
glancing
at
the
young
men
she
turned
on
the
van
ness
sisters
a
look
of
extreme
disapproval
while
elise
looked
frightened
at
the
whole
proceeding
the
two
horrified
countenances
were
too
much
for
the
van
ness
girls
and
they
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
oh
my
children
cried
alicia
did
you
really
think
us
so
unconventional
even
if
we
are
from
chicago
these
two
boys
are
our
cousins
bob
and
guy
van
ness
and
they
are
travelling
with
us
in
charge
of
our
parents
stand
up
straight
infants
and
be
introduced
miss
farrington
and
miss
fairfield
may
i
present
robert
van
ness
and
mr
guy
porter
van
ness
the
young
men
made
most
deferential
bows
and
greatly
appreciating
the
joke
patty
invited
them
to
join
their
party
and
offered
them
some
of
her
confectionery
but
it
a
shame
to
sit
here
observed
guy
when
there
lots
of
fun
going
on
up
on
the
forward
deck
do
you
girls
want
to
go
up
there
and
play
shuffleboard
i
do
said
patty
readily
i
always
wanted
to
play
shuffleboard
though
i
no
idea
whether
it
played
with
a
pack
of
cards
or
a
tea
set
guy
laughed
at
this
and
promised
to
teach
her
the
game
at
once
so
they
all
went
up
to
the
upper
deck
which
was
uncovered
and
where
in
the
sunlight
groups
of
young
people
were
playing
different
games
both
patty
and
elise
delighted
in
outdoor
sports
and
the
van
ness
girls
were
fond
of
anything
athletic
during
the
games
they
all
made
the
acquaintance
of
florrie
nash
who
though
of
an
extreme
english
type
proved
less
difficult
to
make
friends
with
than
they
had
feared
they
also
met
several
young
men
among
whom
patty
liked
best
a
young
englishman
of
type
named
bert
chester
and
a
young
frenchman
of
musical
tastes
the
latter
was
a
violinist
by
the
name
of
pierre
pauvret
he
seemed
a
trifle
melancholy
patty
thought
but
exceedingly
refined
and
he
stood
by
her
side
as
she
leaned
against
the
rail
looking
at
the
water
and
though
evidently
desirous
to
be
entertaining
he
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
patty
felt
sorry
for
the
youth
and
tried
various
subjects
without
success
in
interesting
him
until
at
last
she
chanced
to
refer
to
music
at
this
pauvret
face
lighted
up
and
he
became
enthusiastic
at
once
ah
the
music
he
exclaimed
it
is
my
life
it
is
my
soul
and
you
do
you
yourself
sing
ah
i
think
yes
i
sing
a
little
said
patty
smiling
kindly
at
him
but
i
have
not
had
much
training
and
my
voice
is
small
ah
said
the
frenchman
i
have
a
certainty
that
you
sing
like
an
angel
but
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
there
will
be
a
concert
on
board
and
you
will
sing
is
it
not
so
i
do
know
said
patty
smiling
i
will
sing
with
pleasure
if
i
am
asked
but
it
may
not
give
my
audience
pleasure
it
will
be
heaven
for
them
declared
the
volatile
young
frenchman
clasping
his
hands
in
apparent
ecstasy
his
exaggerated
manner
amused
patty
for
she
dearly
loved
to
study
new
types
of
people
and
she
began
to
think
there
was
a
varied
assortment
on
board
suddenly
several
people
rushed
wildly
to
the
side
of
the
boat
they
were
followed
by
others
until
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
was
crowding
to
the
rail
patty
followed
of
course
and
found
herself
standing
by
the
side
of
bert
chester
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
a
porpoise
he
replied
as
if
announcing
an
event
of
greatest
importance
a
porpoise
echoed
patty
disgusted
such
a
fuss
about
a
porpoise
why
it
nothing
but
a
fish
my
dear
miss
fairfield
said
the
englishman
looking
at
her
through
his
single
eyeglass
tradition
demands
that
steamer
passengers
shall
always
make
a
fuss
over
a
passing
porpoise
to
be
sure
it
only
a
fish
but
the
fuss
is
because
of
tradition
not
because
of
the
fish
patty
had
always
thought
that
a
single
eyeglass
betokened
a
brainless
fop
but
this
stalwart
young
englishman
wore
his
monocle
so
naturally
and
moreover
so
securely
that
it
seemed
a
component
part
of
him
and
too
his
speech
was
that
of
a
humorous
mind
and
patty
began
to
think
she
must
readjust
her
opinion
is
it
an
english
national
trait
she
said
to
be
so
in
thrall
to
tradition
i
sorry
to
say
it
is
young
chester
responded
somewhat
gravely
in
the
matter
of
the
porpoise
it
is
of
no
great
importance
but
there
are
other
matters
do
you
see
where
englishmen
are
so
hampered
by
tradition
that
individual
volition
is
often
lost
this
was
more
serious
talk
than
patty
was
accustomed
to
but
somehow
she
felt
rather
flattered
to
be
addressed
thus
and
she
tried
to
answer
in
kind
but
she
said
if
the
tradition
is
the
result
of
the
wisdom
of
past
ages
may
it
not
be
of
more
value
than
individual
volition
by
jove
exclaimed
chester
you
have
a
clever
little
head
on
your
young
shoulders
to
take
that
point
so
adroitly
but
let
us
defer
this
somewhat
serious
discussion
until
another
time
and
see
if
it
is
a
porpoise
or
something
else
that
it
attracting
the
curious
crowd
to
the
other
side
of
the
ship
as
they
followed
the
hurrying
people
across
the
deck
chester
went
on
after
you
have
crossed
the
ocean
a
few
more
times
you
will
discover
that
there
are
only
two
things
which
make
the
people
rush
frantically
and
in
hordes
to
the
rail
the
one
that
is
a
porpoise
is
a
passing
steamer
sure
enough
the
object
of
interest
this
time
was
a
distant
steamer
which
was
clearly
visible
on
the
horizon
it
was
sharply
outlined
against
the
blue
sky
and
the
sunlight
gave
it
its
true
value
of
colour
while
the
dark
smoke
that
poured
from
its
smokestack
floated
back
horizontally
like
a
broad
ribbon
but
owing
to
the
distance
there
was
no
effect
of
motion
and
even
the
smoke
as
well
as
the
vessel
seemed
to
be
stationary
that
is
a
real
steamer
said
patty
whimsically
it
a
i
often
seen
them
in
the
offices
of
steamship
companies
this
one
is
framed
as
they
usually
are
but
it
only
a
chromo
all
the
same
there
no
mistaking
its
bright
colouring
and
that
badly
painted
smoke
young
chester
laughed
you
americans
are
so
clever
he
said
now
an
english
girl
would
never
have
known
that
that
was
only
a
painted
steamer
but
as
you
say
you
can
tell
by
the
smoke
that
pretty
badly
done
patty
took
a
decided
liking
to
this
jesting
englishman
and
thought
him
much
more
entertaining
than
the
melancholy
french
musician
she
discovered
that
very
evening
that
chester
possessed
a
fine
voice
and
when
after
dinner
a
dozen
or
more
young
people
gathered
round
the
chairs
of
the
farrington
party
they
all
sang
songs
until
farrington
declared
she
never
wanted
to
attend
a
more
delightful
concert
pauvret
brought
his
violin
and
the
van
ness
boys
produced
a
banjo
and
a
madolin
everybody
seemed
to
sing
at
least
fairly
well
and
some
of
the
voices
were
really
fine
patty
sweet
soprano
received
many
compliments
as
also
did
elise
full
clear
contralto
the
girls
were
accustomed
to
singing
together
and
pauvret
proved
himself
a
true
musician
by
his
sympathetic
accompaniments
everybody
knew
the
popular
songs
of
the
day
and
choruses
and
glees
were
sung
with
that
enthusiasm
which
is
always
noticeable
on
the
water
the
merry
party
adjourned
to
the
for
a
light
supper
after
their
vocal
exercises
patty
was
sorry
that
her
friend
and
tablemate
the
old
had
not
been
visible
since
that
first
dinner
upon
inquiry
she
learned
that
the
old
lady
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
effects
of
the
rolling
sea
but
she
soon
be
around
again
said
the
captain
in
his
bluff
cheery
way
labesse
has
crossed
with
me
many
times
and
though
she
usually
succumbs
for
two
or
three
days
she
is
a
good
sailor
after
that
she
is
passionately
fond
of
music
too
and
when
she
is
about
again
you
young
people
must
make
the
old
ship
ring
for
her
this
they
readily
promised
to
do
and
then
they
wound
up
the
evening
by
a
vigorous
rendition
of
the
marseillaise
followed
by
the
star
spangled
banner
and
god
save
the
king
it
was
all
a
delightful
experience
for
patty
who
dearly
loved
lights
and
music
and
flowers
and
people
and
gay
goings
on
and
she
felt
that
she
was
indeed
a
fortunate
girl
to
have
all
these
pleasures
come
to
her
chapter
viii
days
at
sea
the
time
on
shipboard
passed
all
too
quickly
each
day
was
crammed
full
of
various
amusements
and
occupations
and
patty
and
elise
enjoyed
it
all
thoroughly
although
the
majority
of
passengers
were
french
yet
they
nearly
all
spoke
english
and
there
were
a
number
of
americans
and
english
people
who
proved
to
be
pleasant
and
companionable
the
young
people
from
chicago
seemed
to
wear
well
and
as
she
grew
to
know
them
better
patty
liked
them
very
much
the
van
ness
girls
though
breezy
in
their
manner
were
and
and
their
boy
cousins
were
always
ready
for
anything
and
proved
themselves
capable
of
good
comradeship
the
english
girl
florrie
nash
patty
could
not
quite
understand
florrie
seemed
to
be
willing
to
be
friends
but
there
was
a
coldness
and
reserve
about
her
nature
that
patty
could
not
seem
to
penetrate
as
she
expressed
it
to
elise
florrie
never
seems
herself
quite
certain
whether
she
likes
us
or
we
like
her
oh
it
only
her
way
said
elise
she
does
know
how
to
chum
that
all
but
patty
was
not
satisfied
with
this
and
determined
to
investigate
the
matter
come
for
a
walk
she
said
tucking
her
arm
through
florrie
one
morning
let
walk
around
the
deck
fifty
times
all
by
ourselves
do
you
want
to
yes
if
you
like
and
florrie
walked
along
by
patty
side
apparently
willing
enough
but
without
enthusiasm
why
do
you
put
it
that
way
asked
patty
smiling
do
you
like
to
go
yourself
yes
of
course
i
do
but
i
always
say
that
when
people
ask
me
to
do
anything
it
habit
i
suppose
all
english
people
say
it
i
suppose
it
is
habit
said
patty
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
whole
lot
better
time
if
you
felt
more
interest
in
things
or
rather
if
you
expressed
more
interest
now
look
at
the
van
ness
girls
just
bubbling
over
with
enthusiasm
the
van
ness
girls
are
savages
remarked
florrie
with
an
air
of
decision
indeed
they
not
cried
patty
who
was
always
ready
to
stand
up
for
her
friends
the
trouble
with
you
florrie
is
that
you
think
that
unless
people
have
your
ways
and
your
manners
they
are
no
good
at
all
not
quite
that
returned
florrie
laughing
of
course
we
english
have
our
prejudices
and
other
people
call
us
narrow
but
i
think
we
shall
always
be
so
i
suppose
you
will
said
patty
but
anyway
you
would
have
more
fun
if
you
enjoyed
yourself
more
it
good
of
you
patty
to
care
whether
i
enjoy
myself
or
not
florrie
tone
was
so
sincere
and
humble
as
she
said
this
that
patty
began
to
realise
there
was
a
good
deal
of
character
under
indifferent
manner
of
course
i
care
i
have
grown
to
like
you
florrie
in
these
few
days
and
i
want
to
be
good
friends
with
you
if
you
let
me
if
you
like
said
florrie
again
and
patty
perceived
that
the
phrase
was
merely
a
habit
and
did
not
mean
the
indifference
it
expressed
and
i
want
you
to
visit
me
went
on
florrie
i
travelling
now
to
paris
with
my
aunt
who
took
me
to
the
states
for
a
trip
from
paris
i
shall
soon
go
back
to
my
country
home
in
england
and
i
wish
you
would
visit
me
there
you
and
elise
both
oh
patty
you
have
no
idea
how
beautiful
england
is
in
the
springtime
the
may
blooms
thickly
along
the
lanes
till
they
masses
of
pink
fragrance
and
the
sky
is
the
most
wonderful
blue
and
the
birds
sing
and
it
is
like
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
the
tears
came
into
florrie
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
patty
was
amazed
that
this
girl
should
be
so
moved
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
spring
landscape
i
should
dearly
love
to
visit
you
florrie
but
i
ca
promise
of
course
for
i
with
the
farringtons
and
must
do
as
they
say
yes
of
course
but
i
do
hope
you
can
come
you
would
love
our
country
place
patty
it
is
so
large
and
so
old
and
so
beautiful
florrie
said
this
with
no
effect
of
boasting
but
merely
with
a
sincere
appreciation
of
her
beautiful
home
then
as
she
went
on
to
tell
of
the
animals
and
pets
there
and
of
the
park
and
woods
of
the
estate
patty
found
that
the
girl
could
indeed
be
enthusiastic
when
she
chose
this
made
patty
like
her
all
the
better
for
it
proved
she
had
enthusiasm
enough
when
a
subject
appealed
to
her
but
when
they
were
joined
by
the
crowd
of
gay
young
people
begging
them
to
come
and
play
games
florrie
seemed
to
shut
up
into
herself
again
and
assumed
once
more
her
air
of
cold
indifference
but
if
florrie
was
lacking
in
enthusiasm
it
was
not
so
with
another
of
patty
friends
labesse
who
had
recovered
from
her
indisposition
had
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
patty
and
would
have
liked
to
monopolise
her
completely
patty
was
kind
to
the
old
lady
and
did
much
to
entertain
her
but
she
was
not
willing
to
give
up
all
her
time
to
her
the
old
greatly
delighted
to
carry
patty
off
to
her
stateroom
there
to
talk
to
her
or
listen
to
her
read
aloud
except
for
her
maid
was
alone
and
patty
felt
sorry
for
her
and
was
glad
to
cheer
her
up
not
that
she
needed
cheering
exactly
for
she
was
of
a
merry
and
volatile
disposition
except
when
she
gave
way
to
exhibitions
of
temper
which
were
not
infrequent
one
morning
she
called
patty
to
her
room
and
surprised
the
girl
by
giving
her
a
present
of
a
handsome
and
valuable
old
necklace
it
was
of
curiously
wrought
gold
and
though
patty
admired
it
extremely
she
hesitated
about
accepting
such
a
gift
from
a
comparative
stranger
but
yes
said
it
is
for
you
i
wish
to
give
it
to
you
i
have
taken
such
a
fancy
to
you
you
could
scarce
believe
and
i
adore
to
decorate
you
thus
she
clasped
the
necklace
about
patty
throat
with
an
air
that
plainly
said
she
would
be
much
offended
if
the
gift
were
refused
so
patty
decided
to
keep
it
at
least
until
she
could
get
an
opportunity
to
ask
farrington
advice
on
the
subject
when
she
did
ask
her
farrington
told
her
to
keep
it
by
all
means
she
said
she
had
no
doubt
the
old
enjoyed
making
the
gift
far
more
than
patty
was
pleased
to
receive
it
so
patty
kept
the
trinket
which
was
really
a
very
fine
specimen
of
the
goldsmith
art
and
my
dear
the
old
lady
went
on
the
day
that
she
gave
patty
the
necklace
you
must
and
shall
come
to
visit
me
in
my
chateau
my
home
is
the
most
beautifull
an
old
chateau
at
germain
not
far
from
paris
and
you
can
come
but
often
and
stay
with
me
for
the
long
time
patty
thanked
her
but
would
not
promise
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
accept
no
invitations
that
could
not
include
the
farringtons
but
labesse
did
include
the
farringtons
and
invited
the
whole
party
to
visit
her
in
the
winter
farrington
gave
no
definite
answer
but
said
she
would
see
about
it
and
perhaps
they
would
run
out
for
the
for
the
first
five
or
six
days
of
their
journey
the
weather
was
perfect
and
the
ocean
calm
and
level
but
one
morning
they
awoke
to
find
it
raining
and
later
the
rain
developed
into
a
real
storm
the
wind
blew
furiously
and
the
boat
pitched
about
in
a
manner
really
alarming
the
old
took
to
her
stateroom
and
farrington
also
was
unable
to
leave
hers
but
the
girls
were
pleased
rather
than
otherwise
patty
and
elise
proved
themselves
thoroughly
good
sailors
and
were
among
the
few
who
appeared
at
the
table
at
luncheon
after
the
meal
bob
and
guy
van
ness
came
up
to
the
girls
and
asked
them
if
they
cared
to
brave
the
storm
sufficiently
to
go
out
on
deck
elise
though
not
timid
declared
that
she
could
see
all
she
wished
through
the
windows
but
patty
always
ready
for
a
new
experience
expressed
her
desire
to
go
she
put
on
her
own
little
and
tied
a
veil
over
her
small
cap
but
when
she
presented
herself
as
ready
the
boys
laughed
at
her
preparations
that
fancy
little
mackintosh
is
no
good
said
bob
but
you
wait
a
minute
patty
we
fix
you
bob
disappeared
and
soon
returned
bringing
from
somewhere
an
oilskin
coat
and
cap
of
a
brilliant
yellow
color
these
enveloped
patty
completely
and
as
the
boys
were
arrayed
in
similar
fashion
they
looked
like
three
members
of
a
corps
or
as
patty
said
like
the
man
in
the
advertisement
of
oil
although
the
yellow
oilskins
were
by
no
means
beautiful
yet
rosy
face
peeping
out
from
under
the
cap
was
a
pretty
picture
laughing
with
glee
they
stepped
out
on
the
deck
into
the
storm
the
stepping
out
was
no
easy
matter
for
the
wind
was
blowing
a
hurricane
and
the
spray
was
dashing
across
the
decks
while
the
rain
seemed
to
come
from
all
directions
at
once
with
the
two
big
boys
on
either
side
of
her
patty
felt
no
fear
and
as
they
walked
forward
toward
the
bow
of
the
ship
she
felt
well
repaid
for
coming
out
by
the
grandeur
of
the
sight
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
sea
from
sky
as
both
were
of
the
same
leaden
grey
and
the
torrents
of
rain
added
to
the
obscurity
the
ocean
was
in
a
turmoil
frothing
and
fuming
and
the
waves
rolled
over
and
broke
against
the
ship
with
angry
vehemence
patty
though
not
frightened
was
awed
at
the
majesty
of
the
elements
and
did
not
in
the
least
mind
the
rain
and
spray
in
her
face
as
she
gazed
at
the
scene
you
good
wood
exclaimed
guy
not
many
girls
could
stand
up
against
a
storm
like
this
patty
shook
the
wet
curls
out
of
her
eyes
as
she
smiled
up
at
him
i
love
it
she
exclaimed
but
she
could
hardly
make
her
voice
heard
for
the
roar
of
the
sea
and
the
storm
up
and
down
the
decks
they
walked
or
rather
tried
to
walk
now
battling
against
the
wind
and
now
being
swept
along
in
front
of
it
until
almost
exhausted
patty
dropped
down
on
a
coil
of
rope
in
a
comparatively
sheltered
corner
the
boys
sat
down
beside
her
and
they
watched
the
angry
ocean
at
times
the
great
waves
seemed
as
if
they
would
engulf
the
pitching
ship
but
after
each
wave
the
steamer
righted
herself
proudly
and
prepared
to
careen
again
on
the
next
after
a
time
patty
declared
she
had
enough
of
it
and
also
expressed
her
opinion
that
oilskins
were
not
such
a
positive
protection
against
the
wet
as
they
were
reputed
to
be
so
indoors
they
went
warm
and
glowing
from
their
vigorous
exercise
and
their
appetites
sharpened
by
their
rough
battle
with
the
weather
every
day
there
seemed
to
be
something
new
to
do
i
been
told
said
patty
that
life
on
an
ocean
steamer
is
monotonous
but
i
ca
find
any
monotony
we
done
something
different
every
day
have
we
elise
yes
and
next
will
be
the
concert
and
that
will
be
best
of
all
what
are
you
going
to
sing
patty
i
do
know
i
do
want
to
sing
at
all
but
your
mother
said
better
sing
once
because
they
all
insist
on
it
so
and
i
do
like
to
be
accommodating
i
should
think
you
did
patty
you
never
anything
but
accommodating
oh
pooh
it
no
trouble
to
me
to
sing
i
just
as
lief
do
it
as
not
only
it
seems
foolish
for
me
to
sing
when
there
are
so
many
older
people
with
better
voices
to
do
it
well
sing
some
simple
little
ballad
and
i
do
believe
but
what
the
people
will
like
it
just
as
much
as
the
arias
and
things
sung
by
the
more
pretentious
singers
so
patty
followed
elise
advice
and
when
the
night
of
the
concert
came
her
name
was
on
the
programme
for
one
song
and
as
elise
had
thought
it
pleased
the
audience
quite
as
well
as
some
of
the
more
elaborate
efforts
patty
wore
one
of
her
pretty
new
dresses
a
simple
little
frock
of
white
chiffon
cloth
with
touches
here
and
there
of
light
blue
velvet
her
only
ornament
was
the
necklace
that
labesse
had
given
her
and
in
her
curly
golden
hair
was
a
single
white
rose
very
sweet
she
looked
as
she
stood
on
the
platform
to
sing
her
little
song
she
had
chosen
my
ain
countree
as
being
likely
to
please
a
popular
audience
and
also
not
difficult
to
sing
pauvret
accompanied
her
on
his
violin
and
so
effective
was
his
accompaniment
and
so
sweet
pretty
patty
singing
of
the
old
song
that
their
performance
proved
to
be
the
most
attractive
number
on
the
programme
so
prolonged
was
the
applause
and
so
persistent
the
cry
of
encore
that
patty
felt
she
really
must
respond
with
another
song
so
she
sang
stevenson
little
verses
in
winter
i
get
up
at
night
which
have
been
set
to
such
delightful
music
again
accompaniment
added
to
the
charm
of
the
song
and
patty
returned
to
her
place
in
the
audience
quite
embarrassed
at
the
praises
heaped
upon
her
elise
sang
too
in
a
quartette
of
four
girls
they
had
practised
together
considerably
and
sang
really
well
there
were
many
other
musical
numbers
interspersed
with
monologues
and
recitations
and
the
programme
wound
up
with
a
series
of
tableaux
patty
was
in
her
element
in
these
and
had
helped
to
arrange
them
she
took
part
in
some
of
them
herself
and
in
others
she
arranged
the
groups
to
form
effective
pictures
an
immense
gilt
picture
frame
stretched
across
with
gauze
was
at
the
front
of
the
stage
this
was
held
up
on
either
side
by
two
seamen
of
the
ship
in
their
sailor
costume
all
of
the
tableaux
were
shown
as
pictures
in
this
frame
and
they
called
forth
enthusiastic
and
appreciative
applause
old
labesse
had
been
induced
to
appear
in
one
of
the
tableaux
and
as
she
possessed
strikingly
handsome
costumes
she
wore
one
of
the
prettiest
and
made
an
easily
recognisable
representation
of
a
painting
by
nattier
altogether
the
concert
was
a
great
success
and
everybody
had
a
good
time
it
was
expected
that
they
would
see
land
the
next
day
and
so
the
concert
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
farewell
function
everybody
was
shaking
hands
and
saying
to
everybody
else
and
after
many
good
wishes
and
our
two
tired
and
sleepy
girls
went
to
their
stateroom
chapter
ix
paris
the
next
morning
the
girls
spent
in
packing
and
getting
ready
to
go
ashore
i
sure
i
do
know
where
all
these
things
came
from
said
patty
but
i
know
i
have
just
about
twice
as
many
earthly
possessions
as
i
had
when
i
came
aboard
i
hate
to
pitch
them
out
of
the
porthole
but
i
simply
ca
get
them
all
in
my
trunks
nor
i
said
elise
people
have
been
giving
us
things
ever
since
we
started
and
we
must
be
greedies
because
we
have
given
anything
away
and
now
what
shall
we
do
with
them
let
give
a
lot
away
said
patty
we
pretty
much
read
all
we
want
to
of
this
mountain
of
light
literature
let
give
it
all
to
the
stewardess
and
what
do
you
think
elise
about
giving
yankee
doodle
to
the
captain
he
is
a
blessed
old
bear
and
i
hate
to
look
forward
to
life
without
him
but
i
do
see
how
we
can
cart
him
to
paris
unless
we
carry
him
in
our
arms
and
that
where
i
draw
the
line
so
do
i
declared
elise
we
might
ask
lisette
to
carry
him
but
i
know
she
would
want
to
do
it
yes
let
give
him
to
the
captain
as
a
souvenir
of
our
trip
this
plan
was
carried
out
and
the
captain
was
really
delighted
at
the
comical
gift
he
said
he
should
always
keep
it
as
a
remembrance
of
the
donors
and
he
hoped
that
when
they
returned
to
america
they
would
again
travel
on
his
ship
the
steamer
stopped
at
plymouth
and
then
went
straight
on
to
havre
everybody
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
passengers
were
getting
off
and
mails
getting
on
at
plymouth
and
plenty
of
wonderful
and
interesting
things
to
look
at
as
they
sailed
along
the
channel
patty
felt
truly
sorry
to
say
to
many
of
the
friends
she
had
made
on
board
but
from
others
she
would
not
be
parted
until
they
reached
paris
the
van
ness
party
the
old
florrie
nash
bert
chester
and
pauvret
were
all
going
in
the
special
train
to
paris
as
the
farringtons
were
patty
thought
this
meant
they
could
all
travel
together
but
to
her
surprise
she
found
the
french
trains
very
different
from
those
on
american
railroads
the
special
which
they
were
to
take
left
directly
from
the
steamer
dock
and
was
an
express
direct
to
paris
without
stop
landing
them
there
in
less
than
four
hours
the
farrington
party
had
a
whole
compartment
in
this
train
and
as
a
compartment
only
holds
six
people
they
comfortably
filled
it
using
the
extra
seat
for
hand
luggage
and
so
forth
patty
thought
the
appointments
more
luxurious
than
our
own
for
the
seats
were
beautifully
upholstered
in
a
material
and
everything
was
lavishly
decorated
after
the
french
fashion
all
of
these
compartments
opened
on
to
a
corridor
which
ran
along
the
side
of
the
car
and
patty
soon
discovered
that
thus
she
could
visit
her
neighbours
in
the
other
compartments
both
patty
and
elise
were
greatly
excited
and
interested
in
watching
the
french
landscapes
and
trying
to
make
out
the
names
of
the
towns
through
which
they
rapidly
flew
but
with
the
exception
of
some
of
the
larger
towns
they
could
not
read
the
names
and
so
gave
that
up
for
the
more
interesting
occupation
of
watching
the
villages
and
hamlets
as
they
succeeded
each
other
bert
chester
came
in
to
visit
them
and
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
see
them
in
paris
he
was
to
remain
there
only
a
week
and
then
he
was
to
join
some
of
his
friends
some
young
englishmen
and
go
for
a
short
motor
tour
in
southern
france
farrington
said
that
he
expected
to
take
his
party
motoring
along
the
same
route
but
did
not
expect
to
go
at
present
young
chester
was
sorry
that
they
could
not
go
together
but
said
that
perhaps
when
farrington
was
ready
he
and
his
friends
would
come
over
again
for
another
spin
bert
chester
was
a
son
of
a
wealthy
english
squire
and
though
distinctly
british
in
his
ways
was
enough
to
like
americans
and
moreover
was
a
young
man
of
innate
politeness
and
affable
manners
the
elder
farringtons
liked
him
extremely
and
cordially
invited
him
to
come
to
see
them
while
in
paris
we
have
a
house
of
our
own
just
at
first
explained
elise
we
going
to
a
hotel
while
father
and
mother
look
around
and
select
a
house
for
the
winter
i
glad
said
patty
to
go
to
a
hotel
first
i
never
stayed
at
a
big
hotel
and
i
sure
it
will
be
delightful
for
a
time
illustration
with
caption
the
next
morning
the
girls
spent
in
packing
and
getting
ready
to
go
ashore
you
like
the
one
you
going
to
said
chester
the
ritz
is
really
the
old
palace
of
the
castiglione
an
ancient
french
family
and
though
it
is
of
course
somewhat
rebuilt
much
of
the
original
remains
especially
the
beautiful
old
garden
with
its
wonderful
trees
and
fountain
i
give
you
a
day
or
two
to
yourselves
and
then
i
shall
come
around
to
call
and
shall
expect
you
to
be
glad
to
see
me
we
be
very
glad
to
see
you
said
patty
cordially
for
she
had
a
sincere
liking
for
the
young
englishman
then
patty
and
elise
went
with
bert
to
look
in
for
a
little
chat
with
the
van
ness
party
although
patty
liked
the
van
ness
girls
in
a
way
she
was
rather
relieved
to
find
that
they
were
not
going
to
the
same
hotel
patty
had
an
intuitive
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
she
help
thinking
that
the
van
ness
sisters
though
and
were
of
a
type
apt
to
be
a
trifle
too
conspicuous
in
a
large
hotel
the
farringtons
were
folk
and
patty
had
often
noticed
and
admired
the
dignified
yet
pleasant
manner
which
farrington
invariably
showed
to
officials
or
to
servants
he
never
gave
orders
in
a
loud
voice
or
dictatorial
manner
yet
his
orders
were
always
carried
out
obediently
and
willingly
and
everybody
showed
him
the
greatest
respect
and
deference
van
ness
on
the
other
hand
was
imperious
and
ostentatious
he
was
prone
to
be
critical
and
often
became
annoyed
at
trifles
patty
was
rapidly
learning
that
the
true
character
can
be
very
easily
discovered
among
one
travelling
companions
there
is
something
about
the
friction
of
travel
that
brings
out
all
that
is
worst
and
best
in
one
disposition
and
so
when
patty
found
that
the
van
nesses
were
going
to
a
different
hotel
from
themselves
she
was
really
glad
though
she
hoped
to
see
them
occasionally
during
their
stay
in
paris
the
train
reached
the
gare
du
nord
at
about
six
and
when
our
party
went
into
the
rather
dimly
lighted
station
patty
thought
she
had
never
before
seen
such
pandemonium
everybody
seemed
to
be
in
trouble
of
some
sort
some
were
running
hither
and
thither
exclaiming
and
expostulating
but
apparently
to
no
avail
others
sat
hopelessly
and
helplessly
on
their
own
luggage
seeming
to
despair
of
ever
getting
any
further
the
luggage
room
was
an
immense
place
and
rather
damp
there
were
several
separate
counters
where
passengers
were
supposed
to
attend
to
the
checking
of
their
baggage
but
though
there
were
plenty
of
officials
and
porters
about
none
of
them
seemed
anxious
or
even
willing
to
wait
upon
anybody
patty
saw
many
people
appeal
to
one
man
after
another
in
a
vain
hope
of
getting
their
wants
attended
to
but
it
seemed
to
be
almost
impossible
to
those
who
could
not
speak
french
the
situation
was
hopeless
indeed
patty
watched
one
poor
lady
who
seemed
to
be
travelling
alone
and
who
continually
inquired
of
the
stolid
and
unobliging
porters
do
you
speak
english
and
invariably
received
the
reply
non
madame
non
madame
the
lonely
little
lady
seemed
to
be
in
despair
and
patty
wished
she
could
help
her
but
she
did
not
know
herself
what
made
the
difficulty
at
last
she
discovered
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
a
customs
inspector
and
a
porter
and
a
railway
official
all
together
in
one
place
and
at
one
time
this
done
the
rest
was
easy
at
least
to
the
traveller
who
knew
sufficient
french
to
make
his
wants
known
this
farrington
managed
to
accomplish
after
some
delay
the
official
ceremonies
then
being
soon
over
and
our
travellers
having
repeatedly
declared
that
they
were
transporting
nothing
eatable
they
were
allowed
to
drive
away
in
cabs
the
cabs
in
paris
are
of
the
low
open
pattern
like
a
victoria
and
they
looked
very
strange
and
informal
to
patty
who
had
never
seen
any
but
closed
cabs
or
hansoms
and
farrington
rode
in
the
first
cab
which
was
followed
by
another
containing
patty
and
elise
with
lisette
who
sat
on
the
small
folding
front
seat
patty
held
her
breath
with
excitement
when
she
realised
that
she
was
in
paris
at
last
they
drove
through
the
streets
which
were
not
very
well
lighted
gazing
eagerly
at
the
strange
sights
everywhere
about
them
their
hotel
was
in
the
place
vendome
and
the
drive
there
from
the
station
was
not
through
the
beautiful
boulevards
but
through
some
narrow
and
not
particularly
clean
streets
but
when
they
rolled
into
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
drove
toward
the
place
vendome
the
girls
began
to
think
that
paris
was
beautiful
after
all
it
was
rather
more
than
dusk
but
not
dark
and
the
great
square
with
its
circumference
of
colonnaded
buildings
and
the
wonderful
column
in
the
centre
was
exceedingly
impressive
and
filled
patty
soul
with
a
rapturous
awe
oh
elise
she
cried
grasping
her
companion
hand
i
never
supposed
paris
would
be
like
this
i
thought
it
would
be
bright
and
gay
and
festive
but
instead
of
that
it
grand
and
solemn
and
so
it
is
here
said
elise
but
there
is
plenty
of
brightness
and
gaiety
in
some
parts
of
the
city
i
expect
of
course
this
is
historic
ground
and
i
suppose
it
was
pretty
much
as
it
is
now
in
the
days
when
they
were
building
french
history
that
napoleon
on
top
of
that
statue
though
you
ca
recognise
him
from
here
you
know
about
the
column
of
course
it
been
overthrown
and
rebuilt
three
or
four
times
yes
i
remember
studying
about
it
in
french
history
it
was
torn
down
at
the
time
of
the
commune
and
later
from
the
fragments
but
you
know
when
you
study
those
dry
facts
they
do
seem
to
mean
anything
but
to
be
here
really
in
paris
looking
at
that
wonderful
column
in
this
dusky
light
and
the
stars
just
beginning
to
show
oh
elise
it
more
like
fairy
tales
than
history
i
love
it
too
said
elise
and
i
so
glad
to
be
here
with
you
oh
patty
we
are
going
to
have
a
beautiful
time
well
i
rather
guess
we
are
said
patty
with
true
yankee
enthusiasm
then
their
cabs
drove
in
at
the
arched
entrance
of
the
hotel
ritz
and
a
most
important
looking
personage
in
blue
uniform
assisted
them
to
alight
other
attendants
in
unostentatious
livery
swung
open
the
glass
doors
and
our
party
entered
the
proprietor
who
advanced
to
meet
them
was
a
courtly
polite
frenchman
in
correct
evening
dress
whose
suave
and
deferential
manner
was
truly
typical
of
his
race
he
seemed
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
his
newly
arrived
guests
and
himself
conducted
them
to
their
apartments
patty
followed
with
the
rest
feeling
almost
like
pinching
herself
to
see
if
she
were
awake
or
in
an
enchanted
dream
the
hotel
was
particularly
beautiful
and
the
furnishings
unlike
any
she
had
ever
seen
before
carpets
furniture
and
decorations
were
all
in
the
palest
tints
of
lovely
colours
doors
and
windows
and
many
of
the
partitioned
walls
were
of
glass
in
ornate
gilt
frames
through
which
one
could
see
fascinating
rooms
beyond
a
few
choice
pictures
hung
on
the
walls
and
here
and
there
were
french
cabinets
of
curios
and
rare
laces
the
elevator
seemed
to
be
entirely
of
glass
and
was
furnished
with
dainty
white
upholstery
and
gilded
woodwork
bouquets
of
fresh
flowers
were
here
and
there
on
small
tables
in
the
rooms
and
halls
the
suite
of
rooms
allotted
to
the
farringtons
looked
out
upon
the
place
vendome
and
patty
flew
to
the
window
to
gaze
again
upon
the
beautiful
scene
the
rooms
were
daintily
furnished
with
the
same
exquisite
taste
that
prevailed
throughout
the
house
lace
curtains
framed
the
windows
an
empire
clock
and
candelabra
graced
the
carved
mantel
and
the
furniture
was
rich
and
abundant
i
do
think
said
patty
that
i
ever
saw
a
more
beautiful
palace
and
i
so
glad
i
here
i
do
know
what
to
do
just
think
of
it
elise
we
live
here
in
this
lovely
room
for
a
fortnight
anyway
it
is
lovely
said
elise
but
i
expect
we
get
tired
of
hotel
life
and
be
glad
to
have
a
home
of
our
own
very
likely
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
but
i
shall
be
perfectly
happy
wherever
we
are
i
believe
you
will
patty
said
elise
laughing
you
love
this
beautiful
place
but
if
it
had
been
half
as
pretty
you
would
have
made
just
as
much
fuss
over
it
i
know
it
said
patty
rather
apologetically
but
i
ca
help
it
elise
i
seem
to
be
made
that
way
when
i
like
anything
you
know
i
enjoy
it
just
as
much
as
i
possibly
can
and
that
all
i
can
do
anyway
the
room
which
the
two
girls
were
to
share
was
a
large
apartment
with
dressing
rooms
and
bath
adjoining
it
was
perfect
in
every
detail
of
comfort
and
luxury
as
well
as
beauty
but
when
lisette
came
in
to
assist
the
girls
in
dressing
for
dinner
she
found
them
both
hanging
out
of
the
front
windows
gazing
at
the
vendome
column
however
they
expressed
themselves
as
quite
ready
to
prepare
for
dinner
and
after
doning
pretty
light
costumes
they
joined
and
farrington
and
went
down
to
the
the
proper
of
the
hotel
was
an
indoor
apartment
but
all
through
the
summer
the
guests
were
accustomed
to
dine
under
the
open
sky
at
small
tables
in
the
garden
owing
to
an
unusually
late
season
it
was
still
warm
enough
to
dine
outside
and
when
patty
saw
the
scene
in
the
garden
she
thought
paris
was
fairyland
indeed
though
called
a
garden
it
was
really
a
court
but
all
round
its
edge
on
two
sides
were
large
old
trees
with
gnarled
and
twisted
trunks
and
thick
foliage
of
glossy
green
under
the
trees
were
full
of
blossoming
plants
and
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
themselves
were
hung
globes
of
electric
lights
about
the
size
of
an
orange
the
effect
of
these
brilliant
spheres
in
the
dark
trees
was
as
beautiful
as
it
was
unusual
and
the
scene
was
further
made
bright
by
arches
and
festoons
of
brilliant
coloured
lights
which
crossed
and
twined
above
their
heads
in
every
direction
at
the
end
of
the
garden
was
an
immense
fountain
surrounded
by
statues
and
playing
many
jets
of
water
which
flashed
and
sparkled
in
the
light
around
two
sides
of
the
garden
ran
the
verandas
of
the
hotel
and
the
diners
could
sit
on
these
verandas
or
out
in
the
open
as
they
preferred
the
gay
scene
was
completed
by
the
throngs
of
people
the
french
women
in
their
dainty
costumes
the
french
men
with
their
correct
garb
and
demeanour
as
well
as
a
good
sprinkling
of
strangers
from
other
countries
so
interested
was
patty
in
looking
at
it
all
that
she
declared
she
did
want
a
thing
to
eat
but
when
the
choice
selections
of
french
cookery
were
placed
before
her
she
changed
her
mind
and
did
full
justice
to
the
repast
after
dinner
they
sat
for
a
short
time
in
the
and
then
farrington
declared
they
must
all
go
to
rest
as
he
had
planned
a
busy
day
for
them
on
the
morrow
chapter
x
sightseeing
they
rose
next
morning
to
find
a
perfect
autumn
day
awaiting
them
to
patty
surprise
dainty
breakfast
trays
were
brought
to
their
bedsides
it
is
the
custom
of
the
country
elise
explained
nobody
ever
goes
downstairs
to
breakfast
in
paris
it
a
custom
that
suits
me
well
enough
at
least
what
there
is
of
it
i
free
to
confess
that
this
rather
smallish
cup
of
chocolate
and
two
not
very
large
rolls
and
a
tiny
bit
of
butter
do
not
seem
to
me
all
that
a
healthy
appetite
can
desire
i
afraid
you
an
incorrigible
american
said
elise
laughing
now
this
little
spread
is
ample
for
me
but
i
dare
say
you
can
have
more
if
you
want
it
no
indeed
said
patty
when
i
in
paris
i
do
as
the
romans
do
even
if
i
starve
but
patty
did
starve
for
it
was
not
long
before
farrington
sent
word
that
the
girls
were
to
come
downstairs
as
soon
as
possible
equipped
for
a
drive
but
before
the
drive
he
insisted
that
they
should
eat
a
good
and
substantial
breakfast
as
he
wanted
them
to
put
in
a
long
morning
sightseeing
farrington
had
concluded
not
to
go
with
them
as
she
was
resting
after
her
journey
and
moreover
the
sights
were
not
such
a
novelty
to
her
as
they
would
be
to
the
young
people
so
when
they
were
all
ready
to
start
they
found
an
automobile
at
the
door
waiting
for
them
this
is
the
most
comfortable
way
to
see
paris
said
farrington
as
they
got
in
i
have
taken
this
car
for
a
week
on
trial
and
if
it
proves
satisfactory
we
can
keep
it
all
winter
a
chauffeur
drove
the
car
and
farrington
sat
in
the
tonneau
between
the
two
girls
that
he
might
point
out
to
them
the
places
of
interest
if
patty
had
thought
paris
beautiful
by
night
she
thought
it
even
more
so
in
the
clear
bright
sunshine
there
is
no
sunshine
in
the
world
quite
so
clearly
bright
as
that
of
paris
or
at
least
it
seems
so
i
want
you
to
get
the
principal
locations
fixed
in
your
minds
said
farrington
so
now
as
you
see
we
are
starting
from
the
place
vendome
going
straight
down
the
short
rue
castiglione
to
the
rue
de
rivoli
now
we
have
reached
the
corner
and
we
turn
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
this
is
a
beautiful
street
crowded
with
shops
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
side
at
this
point
you
see
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
we
turn
to
the
right
and
go
directly
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
as
we
reach
it
you
may
see
to
the
right
up
through
the
rue
royale
the
church
of
the
madeleine
that
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
paris
churches
and
you
shall
visit
it
of
course
but
not
now
i
want
you
to
get
merely
a
birdseye
view
a
sort
of
general
idea
of
locations
but
here
we
are
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
obelisk
which
you
see
in
the
centre
was
brought
from
egypt
many
years
ago
it
is
very
like
our
own
obelisk
in
central
park
and
also
cleopatra
needle
in
london
from
here
we
turn
into
one
of
the
most
beautiful
avenues
in
the
world
the
champs
elysees
this
avenue
extends
from
the
place
de
la
concorde
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
viewing
it
as
we
do
now
rolling
along
this
perfect
road
in
a
motor
car
or
automobile
as
we
must
learn
to
call
it
while
in
france
you
are
taking
no
doubt
one
of
the
most
perfect
rides
in
the
world
the
full
name
of
the
arch
is
arc
de
triomphe
de
this
means
a
star
and
it
is
called
thus
because
it
is
a
centre
from
which
radiate
no
less
than
a
dozen
beautiful
avenues
we
will
drive
slowly
round
the
arch
that
you
may
see
its
general
beauty
but
we
will
not
now
stop
to
examine
it
closely
it
is
so
different
exclaimed
patty
to
see
these
things
in
reality
or
to
study
about
them
in
history
i
seen
pictures
of
this
arch
lots
of
times
but
it
never
seemed
before
as
if
it
were
a
real
thing
it
beautiful
i
think
i
could
spend
a
whole
day
looking
at
it
patty
love
of
the
beautiful
was
intuitive
and
all
embracing
she
knew
little
of
architecture
or
sculpture
technically
but
the
sublime
majesty
and
imposing
grandeur
of
the
noble
arch
impressed
her
as
it
does
all
true
beauty
lovers
the
continuation
of
the
champs
elysees
beyond
the
arch
went
on
farrington
changes
its
name
and
becomes
the
avenue
de
la
grand
armee
but
we
will
not
continue
along
that
way
at
present
but
take
the
next
avenue
to
the
left
which
is
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
why
i
thought
that
was
a
forest
said
patty
is
it
a
street
it
an
avenue
replied
farrington
and
it
leads
to
the
forest
or
rather
park
which
is
called
the
bois
de
boulogne
we
can
take
only
a
short
drive
into
the
park
but
you
may
see
a
few
of
the
beautiful
chateaus
which
are
the
homes
of
the
wealthy
or
aristocratic
french
people
you
will
not
meet
many
equipages
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
but
late
in
the
afternoon
there
is
a
continuous
stream
of
fine
turnouts
of
all
sorts
there
are
many
many
places
of
interest
in
the
bois
but
as
we
have
all
winter
in
which
to
visit
them
we
will
content
ourselves
with
a
brief
visit
it
begins
to
look
said
patty
as
if
even
a
whole
winter
would
be
all
too
short
to
see
the
beauties
and
glories
of
this
wonderful
paris
indeed
it
would
be
too
short
to
see
everything
of
interest
but
i
can
assure
you
my
child
that
with
an
automobile
and
some
idea
of
systematic
sightseeing
we
can
do
a
great
deal
even
in
one
winter
farrington
pointed
out
various
prominent
buildings
as
they
passed
them
and
then
turning
round
went
back
to
the
city
a
swift
ride
about
paris
showed
to
the
girls
such
interesting
places
as
the
louvre
and
the
hotel
de
ville
the
place
de
la
bastile
the
hotel
des
invalides
the
pantheon
and
the
church
of
at
the
last
named
farrington
proposed
that
they
get
out
and
make
a
short
visit
to
the
cathedral
they
did
so
and
both
patty
and
elise
were
much
impressed
by
the
noble
beauty
of
the
interior
as
they
passed
around
the
church
patty
noticed
a
little
frenchwoman
who
seemed
to
be
selling
candles
the
candles
were
of
an
unusual
slender
and
very
tapering
it
occurred
to
patty
that
she
would
like
to
take
some
home
to
nan
as
they
would
be
most
effective
in
an
odd
brass
candlestick
which
was
one
of
nan
chief
treasures
the
candlestick
had
seven
branches
and
as
her
french
seemed
to
desert
her
at
the
critical
moment
patty
indicated
her
wants
by
holding
up
seven
fingers
pointing
to
the
candles
and
then
taking
out
her
purse
the
frenchwoman
seemed
to
understand
and
began
counting
out
seven
candles
patty
looked
anxiously
after
farrington
and
elise
who
had
gone
on
ahead
not
noticing
that
patty
had
stopped
but
she
knew
she
could
soon
catch
up
to
them
if
only
she
could
get
her
candles
and
manage
to
pay
for
them
in
the
confusing
and
unfamiliar
french
money
as
she
was
counting
out
the
change
greatly
to
her
surprise
the
frenchwoman
lighted
her
seven
candles
one
after
the
other
patty
exclaimed
in
dismay
wondering
if
she
did
it
to
test
their
wicks
or
what
could
be
the
reason
but
even
as
she
watched
her
the
woman
placed
the
candles
all
seven
of
them
in
a
sort
of
a
branched
candlestick
on
the
wall
above
her
head
non
non
cried
patty
they
are
mine
mine
mine
oui
oui
oui
exclaimed
the
frenchwoman
nodding
her
head
complacently
and
taking
patty
money
which
she
put
in
a
box
on
the
table
before
her
but
i
want
them
cried
patty
i
want
to
take
them
away
with
me
still
the
woman
smiled
amiably
and
patty
realised
she
was
not
understanding
a
word
but
all
patty
french
and
it
was
not
very
much
at
best
seemed
to
fly
out
of
her
head
and
she
could
not
even
think
how
to
say
i
wish
to
take
them
away
with
me
so
seeing
nothing
else
to
do
she
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
her
dilemma
by
reaching
up
and
taking
the
candles
from
the
sockets
she
blew
them
out
and
holding
them
in
a
bundle
said
pleasantly
papier
having
thought
of
a
french
word
at
last
that
expressed
what
she
wished
the
woman
looked
at
her
in
amazement
as
if
she
had
done
something
wrong
and
poor
patty
was
thoroughly
perplexed
why
i
bought
them
she
exclaimed
forgetting
the
frenchwoman
could
not
understand
her
and
i
paid
you
for
them
and
now
they
mine
and
i
going
to
take
them
away
if
you
wo
give
me
any
paper
to
wrap
them
in
i
carry
them
as
they
are
eon
jour
but
by
this
time
farrington
and
elise
had
returned
in
search
of
their
missing
comrade
and
patty
appealed
to
farrington
explaining
that
she
had
purchased
the
candles
why
yes
they
yours
child
and
certainly
you
may
take
them
away
if
you
like
but
it
is
not
customary
usually
people
buy
the
candles
to
burn
at
the
shrine
of
their
patron
saint
or
in
memory
of
some
friend
and
of
course
the
woman
supposed
that
was
your
intention
well
i
glad
to
understand
it
said
patty
and
i
wish
you
please
explain
it
to
her
for
i
certainly
do
want
to
keep
the
candles
and
i
could
make
her
understand
so
farrington
explained
the
state
of
the
case
in
french
that
the
woman
could
understand
and
all
was
well
and
patty
walked
off
in
triumph
with
her
candles
then
they
went
back
past
the
louvre
and
leaving
the
automobile
again
they
went
for
a
short
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
this
also
fascinated
patty
and
she
thought
it
beautiful
beyond
all
words
after
that
farrington
declared
that
the
girls
must
be
exhausted
and
he
took
them
to
a
delightful
cafe
where
he
refreshed
them
with
ices
and
small
cakes
now
he
said
i
do
suppose
the
eternal
feminine
in
your
nature
will
be
satisfied
without
doing
a
little
shopping
the
large
shops
the
bon
marche
and
the
magasin
du
louvre
are
very
like
our
own
department
stores
and
if
you
choose
you
may
go
there
at
some
other
time
with
farrington
or
lisette
for
i
confess
my
ignorance
of
feminine
furbelows
but
i
will
take
you
to
one
or
two
interesting
shops
on
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
then
if
we
have
time
to
a
few
in
the
avenue
de
their
first
stop
was
at
a
picture
shop
and
patty
nearly
went
wild
over
the
beautiful
photographs
and
water
colours
she
wanted
to
purchase
several
but
farrington
advised
her
to
wait
until
later
when
she
should
perhaps
be
better
able
to
judge
what
she
really
wanted
for
you
see
he
said
after
you
have
been
to
the
louvre
and
other
great
galleries
and
have
made
favourites
as
you
will
among
the
pictures
there
you
will
then
be
able
to
collect
your
photographs
more
intelligently
patty
was
quite
ready
to
abide
by
this
advice
and
she
and
elise
enjoyed
looking
over
the
pictures
and
anticipating
future
purchases
but
though
the
shops
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
were
attractive
they
were
not
nearly
so
splendid
as
those
on
the
avenue
de
indeed
farrington
almost
regretted
having
brought
the
girls
there
for
they
quite
forgot
all
else
in
their
delight
in
looking
at
the
beautiful
wares
they
seemed
content
just
to
walk
along
the
avenue
looking
in
at
the
shop
windows
i
do
want
to
buy
anything
yet
declared
patty
later
on
i
expect
to
get
souvenirs
for
all
of
the
people
at
home
and
i
have
any
amount
of
orders
to
execute
for
marian
wo
it
be
fun
to
do
our
shopping
here
exclaimed
elise
i
never
saw
such
lovely
things
and
truly
patty
the
prices
marked
on
them
are
quite
cheap
much
more
reasonable
than
in
new
york
i
think
so
do
i
and
oh
elise
just
look
at
the
lovely
things
in
this
window
see
that
lovely
and
that
dear
are
they
unusual
yes
exclaimed
elise
equally
rapturous
i
do
wonder
patty
that
people
like
to
shop
in
paris
it
is
truly
fascinating
but
just
wait
until
we
get
mother
out
here
with
us
instead
of
father
she
fidget
around
as
if
she
wanted
us
to
go
home
before
we
fairly
started
elise
looked
reproachfully
at
her
father
who
was
undeniably
fidgeting
i
glad
you
appreciate
the
fact
he
said
that
i
am
impatient
to
get
away
from
these
shop
windows
never
again
will
i
introduce
two
young
girls
into
the
parisian
shopping
district
i
learned
my
lesson
i
take
you
sightseeing
but
farrington
must
take
you
shopping
patty
laughed
and
expressed
her
willingness
to
return
at
once
to
the
hotel
chapter
xi
an
excursion
to
versailles
one
evening
as
our
party
sat
in
the
of
the
hotel
after
dinner
some
callers
cards
were
brought
to
them
the
guests
proved
to
be
bert
chester
and
his
three
friends
of
whom
he
had
told
patty
before
the
four
young
men
were
about
to
start
on
a
motor
tour
and
were
spending
a
few
days
in
paris
first
they
were
all
big
stalwart
young
englishmen
and
when
bert
introduced
paul
and
philip
marchbanks
and
arthur
oram
patty
thought
she
had
never
seen
more
boys
we
jolly
glad
to
be
allowed
to
come
to
see
you
said
phil
marchbanks
addressing
farrington
but
including
them
all
in
his
conversation
we
know
almost
nobody
in
paris
and
we
so
glad
to
see
some
friendly
faces
we
may
as
well
own
up
said
his
brother
paul
that
we
just
a
bit
homesick
we
going
to
have
a
fine
time
of
course
after
we
get
started
but
it
takes
a
few
days
to
get
used
to
it
it
amused
patty
to
think
of
these
great
big
boys
being
homesick
but
she
rather
liked
their
frank
admission
of
it
and
she
began
to
ask
them
questions
about
their
automobile
the
boys
had
no
chauffeur
with
them
and
arthur
oram
drove
the
car
with
occasional
assistance
from
the
others
of
course
the
boys
were
enthusiastic
regarding
their
car
and
young
oram
particularly
fell
into
discussions
with
farrington
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
various
makes
we
done
up
paris
pretty
well
said
bert
chester
we
only
been
arrested
for
speeding
once
but
that
not
surprising
for
they
let
you
go
about
as
fast
as
you
like
here
and
with
their
marvellously
fine
roads
it
more
like
skating
than
anything
else
but
you
only
arrived
here
when
we
did
said
elise
how
can
you
have
done
up
paris
so
soon
well
you
see
said
bert
we
not
going
to
write
a
book
about
it
so
we
did
have
to
take
it
all
in
we
seen
the
outside
of
the
louvre
and
the
inside
of
napoleon
tomb
we
been
to
the
top
of
the
eiffel
tower
and
the
bottom
of
the
catacombs
so
we
flatter
ourselves
that
we
done
up
the
length
and
breadth
and
height
and
depths
at
least
to
our
own
satisfaction
it
a
great
mistake
said
phil
marchbanks
to
overdo
this
sightseeing
business
a
little
goes
a
great
way
with
me
and
if
i
bolt
a
whole
lot
of
sights
all
at
once
i
find
i
ca
digest
them
and
i
have
a
sort
of
attack
of
tourist
indigestion
which
is
a
thing
i
hate
so
do
i
agreed
patty
and
i
think
you
do
quite
right
not
to
attempt
too
much
in
a
short
time
we
are
taking
the
winter
for
it
and
farrington
is
going
to
arrange
it
all
for
us
so
that
i
know
never
have
too
much
or
too
little
how
much
longer
are
you
staying
here
only
a
few
days
replied
bert
chester
and
that
brings
me
to
our
special
errand
we
thought
perhaps
that
is
we
hoped
that
may
be
you
might
all
of
you
agree
to
go
with
us
on
a
sort
of
a
picnic
excursion
to
versailles
we
thought
do
you
see
that
we
could
take
our
car
and
you
could
take
yours
and
we
start
in
the
morning
and
make
a
whole
day
of
it
gorgeous
exclaimed
patty
clapping
her
hands
i
do
think
that
would
be
delightful
i
love
to
go
me
too
chimed
in
elise
mother
do
say
yes
wo
you
you
know
you
just
as
anxious
to
go
there
as
we
are
because
you
spoke
of
it
only
yesterday
yes
indeed
said
farrington
heartily
i
quite
approve
of
the
plan
and
if
your
father
has
no
objection
we
can
make
a
charming
picnic
of
it
farrington
was
quite
as
interested
in
the
project
as
the
others
and
they
immediately
began
to
arrange
the
details
of
the
expedition
bert
chester
had
a
road
map
in
his
pocket
which
showed
exactly
the
routes
they
could
take
but
the
decision
of
these
things
was
left
to
farrington
and
arthur
oram
who
put
their
heads
together
over
the
charts
and
decided
upon
their
way
do
you
know
said
paul
marchbanks
you
the
first
american
girls
i
have
ever
known
socially
i
seen
tourists
in
railway
stations
or
restaurants
but
i
never
talked
to
any
americans
before
for
goodness
sake
exclaimed
patty
have
they
kept
you
walled
up
in
a
dungeon
tower
all
your
life
or
what
not
exactly
that
but
we
english
fellows
who
go
to
school
and
then
to
college
and
meantime
live
in
our
country
homes
with
an
occasional
run
up
to
london
have
almost
no
opportunity
to
meet
anybody
outside
of
our
own
people
and
i
have
jogged
about
as
much
as
a
good
many
fellows
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
to
paris
then
that
explains
your
homesickness
said
patty
smiling
kindly
at
the
big
boy
whose
manner
was
so
frank
and
ingenuous
yes
he
said
i
suppose
i
do
miss
the
family
for
they
are
a
jolly
lot
oh
i
say
wo
you
people
all
come
down
to
our
place
and
see
us
you
going
to
england
of
course
before
you
return
to
the
states
are
you
i
do
know
said
elise
smiling
our
plans
are
uncertain
but
if
we
accept
all
the
delightful
invitations
we
continually
receiving
i
do
know
when
we
ever
shall
get
back
to
new
york
the
next
day
proved
to
be
a
most
perfect
one
for
an
excursion
of
any
sort
they
started
early
for
they
wanted
to
make
a
long
full
day
of
it
and
return
in
time
for
dinner
the
two
automobiles
were
at
the
door
by
nine
and
the
party
was
soon
embarked
as
farrington
did
not
drive
his
own
car
he
went
in
the
other
car
sitting
in
front
with
arthur
orara
in
the
tonneau
of
this
car
were
patty
and
bert
chester
so
in
the
other
car
rode
farrington
and
elise
and
the
two
marchbanks
this
arrangement
seemed
highly
satisfactory
to
all
concerned
and
the
procession
of
two
cars
started
off
gaily
away
they
sped
at
a
rapid
speed
along
the
champs
elysees
through
the
arch
and
away
toward
versailles
the
fresh
crisp
morning
air
the
clear
blue
sky
and
the
bright
sunlight
added
to
the
exhilaration
of
the
swift
motion
endowed
them
all
with
the
most
buoyant
spirits
and
patty
felt
sure
she
had
never
looked
forward
to
a
merrier
happier
day
she
chatted
with
bert
chester
and
asked
him
many
questions
about
the
trip
on
which
he
was
starting
i
do
know
just
where
we
are
going
he
said
i
leave
all
that
to
oram
the
rest
of
us
do
care
and
oram
loves
to
spend
hours
hunting
up
reasons
why
we
should
go
to
this
small
village
that
is
picturesque
or
that
tiny
hamlet
that
is
historic
i
sure
the
queer
little
french
towns
will
all
look
alike
to
me
and
i
not
awfully
keen
about
such
things
anyhow
i
go
for
the
life
and
the
swift
motion
and
the
fresh
air
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
love
that
part
of
it
too
said
patty
but
also
i
like
seeing
the
funny
little
towns
with
their
narrow
streets
and
squealing
dogs
i
think
i
have
never
been
through
a
french
village
that
was
just
spilling
over
with
squealing
dogs
that
because
you
always
go
through
them
in
an
automobile
if
you
were
on
a
walking
tour
now
you
find
the
dogs
all
asleep
but
the
paramount
idea
in
a
french
dog
brain
is
that
he
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
waking
up
and
barking
at
motor
cars
well
they
most
faithful
to
what
they
consider
their
duty
then
said
patty
laughing
for
even
as
she
spoke
they
were
whizzing
through
a
straggling
insignificant
little
village
and
dogs
of
all
sizes
and
colours
seemed
to
spring
up
suddenly
from
nowhere
at
all
and
act
as
if
about
to
devour
the
car
and
its
occupants
but
notwithstanding
the
dogs
the
villages
were
exceedingly
picturesque
and
patty
loved
to
drive
through
them
slowly
that
she
might
see
glimpses
of
the
life
of
the
people
and
it
was
almost
always
necessary
to
go
slowly
for
the
streets
were
so
narrow
and
the
sidewalks
a
mere
shelf
so
that
pedestrians
often
walked
in
the
road
this
made
it
difficult
to
drive
rapidly
and
moreover
many
of
the
streets
were
steep
and
hilly
it
never
seems
to
matter
observed
patty
whether
you
going
out
of
paris
or
coming
in
it
always
uphill
and
never
down
i
think
that
after
you
climbed
a
hill
they
whisk
it
around
the
other
way
so
that
you
obliged
to
climb
it
again
on
your
return
of
course
they
do
agreed
bert
you
can
see
by
the
expression
of
the
people
that
they
chuckling
at
us
now
and
they
chuckle
again
when
we
pass
this
way
still
climbing
neither
of
the
cars
in
which
our
party
travelled
were
good
although
they
could
go
fast
enough
on
the
level
but
nobody
cared
and
notwithstanding
some
delays
the
ground
was
rapidly
covered
there
one
town
i
want
to
go
through
said
patty
but
i
not
sure
it
in
our
route
it
called
of
course
i
know
that
really
noisy
is
not
pronounced
in
the
english
fashion
but
i
like
to
think
that
it
is
and
i
call
it
so
myself
there
no
harm
in
that
i
suppose
a
american
citizen
has
a
right
to
pronounce
french
any
way
she
chooses
and
i
like
that
way
myself
sounds
like
an
abode
of
the
mad
monarch
and
you
expect
to
see
the
king
and
all
his
courtiers
and
subjects
dancing
madly
around
or
playing
hilarious
games
yes
a
sort
of
general
racket
with
everybody
waving
garlands
and
carrying
wreaths
and
flags
floating
and
streamers
streaming
yes
and
cannon
booming
and
salutes
being
fired
and
rockets
and
fireworks
going
off
like
mad
yes
just
that
but
now
i
almost
hope
we
wo
pass
through
it
for
fear
it
should
quite
come
up
to
our
notion
of
it
if
we
do
come
to
it
i
tell
you
in
time
and
you
can
shut
your
eyes
and
pretend
you
asleep
while
we
go
through
but
the
town
in
question
was
not
on
their
route
after
all
and
soon
they
came
flying
in
to
the
town
of
versailles
of
course
they
made
for
the
chateau
at
once
and
alighted
from
the
cars
just
outside
the
great
wall
patty
being
unaccustomed
to
historic
sites
was
deeply
impressed
as
she
walked
up
the
old
steps
and
found
herself
on
an
immense
paved
court
that
seemed
to
be
fairly
flooded
with
the
brightest
sunlight
she
had
ever
seen
as
a
rule
farrington
did
not
enjoy
the
services
of
a
guide
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
people
in
his
charge
he
engaged
one
to
describe
to
them
the
sights
they
were
to
see
the
whole
royal
courtyard
and
the
great
equestrian
statue
of
louis
xiv
seemed
very
wonderful
to
patty
and
she
could
scarcely
realise
that
the
great
french
monarch
himself
had
often
stood
where
she
was
now
standing
i
never
seemed
to
think
of
louis
she
said
as
a
man
he
seems
to
me
always
like
a
set
of
furniture
or
a
wall
decoration
or
at
most
a
costume
now
you
hit
it
said
paul
louis
xiv
was
at
most
a
costume
and
a
handsome
costume
too
i
wish
we
fellows
could
dress
like
that
nowadays
i
wish
so
too
said
elise
it
a
heap
more
picturesque
than
the
clothes
men
wear
at
the
present
day
i
begin
to
feel
said
patty
that
i
wish
i
had
studied
my
french
history
harder
how
many
kings
lived
here
after
louis
two
replied
farrington
and
when
patty
at
one
on
the
sixth
of
october
the
line
of
carriages
drove
louis
xvi
and
his
family
away
from
here
to
paris
the
chateau
was
left
vacant
and
has
never
since
been
occupied
in
october
said
patty
and
probably
just
such
a
blue
and
gold
day
as
this
oh
how
they
must
have
felt
i
would
weep
over
it
now
patty
said
the
elise
they
been
gone
so
long
and
so
many
people
have
wept
for
them
that
i
think
it
wasted
emotion
i
believe
it
would
be
said
patty
smiling
as
far
as
concerned
but
i
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
them
only
i
could
never
weep
before
because
i
never
realised
what
it
was
they
were
leaving
the
party
went
on
into
the
chateau
and
visited
rooms
and
apartments
one
after
the
other
it
was
necessary
to
do
this
quickly
if
they
were
to
do
it
at
all
and
as
farrington
said
a
hasty
tour
of
the
palace
would
give
them
an
idea
of
it
as
a
whole
and
sometime
he
would
bring
the
girls
again
to
enjoy
the
details
more
at
leisure
patty
was
discovering
that
she
was
susceptible
to
what
elise
chose
to
call
wasted
emotion
and
she
found
herself
again
on
the
verge
of
tears
when
they
entered
the
chapel
though
she
did
not
know
enough
of
architecture
to
survey
intelligently
the
somewhat
pompous
apartment
she
was
delightfully
impressed
by
the
rich
adornments
and
the
wonderful
sculptures
bronzes
and
paintings
rather
rapidly
they
passed
through
the
various
salons
of
the
museum
pausing
here
and
there
as
one
or
another
of
the
party
wished
to
examine
something
in
particular
the
state
rooms
and
royal
apartments
were
most
interesting
but
patty
concluded
that
she
liked
best
of
all
the
gallery
of
battles
the
splendid
pictures
of
war
enthralled
her
and
she
would
have
been
glad
had
the
rest
of
the
party
left
her
to
spend
the
entire
day
alone
in
the
great
gallery
but
this
of
course
they
had
no
wish
to
do
and
with
a
last
lingering
glance
at
the
picture
of
napoleon
at
the
battle
of
jena
she
reluctantly
allowed
herself
to
be
led
away
napoleon
was
one
of
patty
heroes
and
she
was
eagerly
interested
in
all
of
the
many
relics
and
souvenirs
of
the
great
man
especially
was
she
interested
in
his
bedroom
and
greatly
admired
the
gorgeous
furnishings
and
quaint
french
bedstead
having
scurried
through
the
palace
and
museum
farrington
declared
that
he
could
do
no
more
sightseeing
until
he
had
eaten
some
sustaining
luncheon
so
again
they
climbed
into
the
automobiles
and
were
whisked
away
to
a
hotel
in
the
town
here
they
were
provided
with
a
most
satisfying
meal
which
was
partaken
of
amid
much
merry
conversation
and
laughter
chapter
xii
shopping
the
afternoon
was
devoted
to
the
gardens
and
the
trianons
elise
was
enraptured
with
the
garden
but
patty
while
she
admired
them
very
much
thought
them
too
stiff
and
formal
for
her
taste
laid
out
as
they
are
according
to
the
laws
of
geometrical
symmetry
it
seemed
to
patty
that
grace
and
beauty
were
sacrificed
to
squares
and
straight
lines
but
none
the
less
was
she
interested
in
the
wonderful
landscape
and
amazed
that
any
grass
could
be
so
green
as
that
of
the
marvelous
green
carpet
the
multitude
of
statues
and
fountains
the
walks
and
terraces
and
the
exquisite
colours
of
the
autumn
trees
made
a
picture
that
patty
never
forgot
the
trianons
presented
new
delights
and
patty
fancied
herself
transported
back
to
the
days
of
marie
antoinette
and
her
elaborately
planned
pleasures
a
place
of
especial
interest
was
the
carriage
house
where
are
exhibited
the
royal
state
carriages
as
they
were
about
to
enter
phil
marchbanks
who
was
ahead
turned
round
with
a
look
of
comical
dismay
on
his
face
we
ca
go
in
he
said
we
ca
fulfil
their
requirements
what
do
you
mean
said
patty
why
here
a
sign
that
says
umbrellas
must
be
left
in
the
cloak
room
you
see
it
imperative
and
as
we
have
no
wet
umbrellas
to
leave
in
the
cloak
room
whatever
shall
we
do
is
it
awful
said
patty
of
course
we
ca
go
in
if
we
fulfil
their
laws
but
it
a
foolish
law
and
better
broken
than
kept
so
i
propose
we
march
on
in
spite
of
it
so
they
marched
on
and
spent
one
of
their
pleasantest
half
hours
admiring
the
royal
coaches
the
coronation
carriage
of
charles
the
pleased
patty
most
especially
as
it
had
been
restored
by
napoleon
and
bore
the
magic
initial
on
its
regalia
farrington
slyly
volunteered
the
information
that
it
stood
for
napoleon
the
third
but
patty
declared
that
she
did
care
as
any
napoleon
was
good
enough
for
her
shopping
then
the
various
sights
of
the
trianons
claimed
their
attention
and
they
visited
the
farm
and
the
dairy
and
the
temple
of
love
and
the
swiss
cottage
and
the
presbytery
and
the
music
pavilion
and
the
mill
until
they
were
all
mixed
up
and
patty
declared
that
her
mind
was
nothing
but
a
kaleidoscope
full
of
broken
bits
of
gay
scenes
then
the
party
went
to
the
grotto
of
apollo
and
sat
down
there
for
a
short
time
to
rest
before
returning
home
this
is
the
first
time
said
patty
that
it
has
seemed
like
a
picnic
but
this
is
a
real
picnic
place
though
a
much
more
grand
one
than
i
ever
picnicked
in
before
you
can
probably
make
up
your
mind
said
bert
that
it
about
the
grandest
picnic
place
there
is
and
speaking
of
picnics
i
like
to
invite
all
this
party
to
dine
with
me
on
our
way
home
where
is
your
asked
farrington
i
show
you
said
bert
eagerly
if
you
only
go
with
me
it
is
quite
time
to
start
yet
but
it
soon
will
be
and
i
take
you
to
an
awfully
jolly
place
and
not
a
bit
out
of
our
way
either
farrington
agreed
to
go
and
the
rest
eagerly
accepted
the
invitation
and
after
resting
a
little
longer
the
party
leisurely
prepared
to
start
at
bert
direction
they
spun
along
the
bois
de
boulogne
until
they
reached
the
pavilion
one
of
those
fairyland
restaurants
which
abound
in
and
near
paris
as
it
was
rather
chilly
to
sit
outside
they
occupied
a
table
in
a
court
and
bert
proved
himself
a
most
satisfactory
host
we
had
an
awfully
jolly
day
he
observed
at
least
i
have
and
i
hope
the
rest
of
you
put
in
a
good
time
it
a
satisfaction
to
feel
that
we
done
up
versailles
but
i
may
as
well
confess
that
i
go
for
that
purpose
so
much
as
to
spend
a
pleasant
day
with
my
friends
patty
declared
that
she
had
enjoyed
the
society
not
only
of
the
friends
who
went
with
her
but
the
companionship
of
the
invisible
ones
whose
presence
seemed
to
haunt
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
palace
and
park
as
patty
looked
about
at
their
gaily
decorated
dining
place
and
looked
out
at
the
brilliantly
lighted
scene
outside
where
the
electric
lights
hung
in
shining
festoons
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
paris
was
a
gay
and
bright
place
after
all
though
when
she
had
entered
it
that
first
night
less
than
a
week
ago
she
had
thought
it
rather
dark
and
oppressive
it
is
dark
said
phil
as
patty
expressed
her
thoughts
to
be
sure
a
place
like
this
is
illuminated
but
the
streets
are
not
half
lighted
and
i
think
it
a
shame
london
streets
at
night
are
much
better
as
to
light
said
bert
but
i
say
you
fellows
you
just
ought
to
see
the
streets
in
new
york
at
night
whew
they
so
bright
they
just
dazzle
you
do
they
patty
broadway
does
but
the
other
streets
are
so
awfully
light
well
they
a
lot
lighter
than
they
are
over
here
but
paris
is
the
worst
of
all
why
i
scared
to
be
out
after
nightfall
if
that
the
case
said
farrington
laughing
we
better
be
starting
now
and
at
any
rate
it
high
time
my
young
charges
were
at
home
i
had
expected
patty
and
elise
to
indulge
in
quite
such
gaieties
as
dining
out
here
but
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
for
them
your
kind
invitation
bert
expressed
his
gratitude
that
farrington
had
made
an
exception
in
his
favour
and
then
the
whole
party
started
homeward
when
she
reached
there
patty
was
so
tired
she
could
scarcely
talk
over
the
pleasures
of
the
day
with
elise
and
she
tumbled
into
bed
without
so
much
as
a
look
at
her
beloved
vendome
column
but
the
next
day
found
the
two
girls
entirely
rested
and
quite
ready
for
more
jaunting
about
but
farrington
declared
that
she
could
do
no
sightseeing
that
day
as
the
somewhat
fatiguing
trip
to
versailles
made
her
quite
contented
to
rest
quietly
for
a
time
so
patty
employed
her
morning
happily
enough
in
writing
letters
home
and
in
arranging
her
album
i
so
glad
she
said
to
elise
that
clementine
gave
me
this
great
big
album
for
i
see
already
it
is
none
too
large
i
taken
out
all
the
new
york
views
and
laid
them
aside
i
shall
probably
give
them
to
somebody
as
there
is
no
sense
in
carrying
them
home
again
and
filling
the
book
with
paris
views
is
it
fortunate
they
invented
for
unmounted
photographs
do
curl
up
so
and
i
hate
those
little
books
of
views
indeed
it
fine
patty
and
you
arranging
them
beautifully
i
ca
do
that
sort
of
thing
at
all
i
as
clumsy
at
it
as
a
hippopotamus
but
i
love
to
have
a
book
like
yours
to
take
home
i
give
you
this
one
said
patty
quickly
and
she
truly
meant
it
for
she
was
generous
by
nature
and
too
she
was
glad
to
give
elise
something
that
she
really
wanted
i
would
take
it
you
need
think
i
a
pig
if
i
am
a
hippopotamus
well
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
elise
the
first
time
we
go
shopping
we
get
a
big
album
exactly
like
this
and
then
we
always
get
duplicate
we
have
so
far
anyway
and
i
fix
both
the
books
oh
patty
that
will
be
lovely
you
do
it
so
neatly
and
daintily
and
i
always
tear
the
corners
and
smudge
the
cards
and
every
old
thing
i
wish
we
could
go
and
buy
the
book
this
very
afternoon
we
ca
your
mother
wo
go
she
too
tired
and
she
never
let
us
bob
about
paris
alone
and
your
father
hates
to
shop
so
he
take
us
i
know
it
patty
but
perhaps
mother
would
let
us
go
with
lisette
anyhow
i
going
to
ask
her
why
yes
said
farrington
when
the
project
was
laid
before
her
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
go
out
and
do
a
little
shopping
in
charge
of
lisette
she
is
a
native
french
girl
herself
she
knows
paris
thoroughly
and
she
most
reliable
and
trustworthy
but
you
must
promise
to
do
only
what
she
allows
you
to
do
and
go
only
where
she
advises
in
this
expedition
she
must
direct
not
you
the
girls
willingly
promised
saying
that
they
only
wanted
to
buy
the
album
and
a
few
little
things
very
well
then
said
farrington
you
may
go
out
for
the
afternoon
i
glad
to
have
you
out
in
the
sunshine
and
you
also
enjoy
looking
at
the
pretty
things
in
the
shops
so
the
girls
arrayed
themselves
in
their
quiet
pretty
street
costumes
and
with
lisette
in
her
tidy
black
gown
they
started
out
they
walked
at
first
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
fascinated
with
the
lovely
trinkets
in
the
shop
windows
unlike
farrington
lisette
did
not
care
how
long
her
young
charges
tarried
nor
was
she
averse
to
looking
at
the
pretty
things
herself
it
a
funny
thing
said
elise
as
they
came
out
of
a
shop
that
the
things
in
a
window
are
always
so
much
prettier
than
the
things
inside
the
shop
that
paris
all
over
said
patty
i
think
the
french
not
only
put
the
best
foot
forward
but
the
foot
they
hold
back
is
usually
not
very
presentable
yes
i
believe
that
true
and
they
always
seem
to
make
the
best
of
everything
and
that
why
they
so
happy
and
but
here
we
are
at
a
stationer
let
buy
the
album
here
the
stationer
proved
to
be
a
most
distracting
place
they
bought
the
album
and
then
they
discovered
a
counter
piled
with
in
which
they
were
soon
deeply
absorbed
but
you
must
get
so
many
elise
cried
patty
as
she
looked
at
the
great
pile
elise
had
laid
aside
to
buy
it
no
fun
at
all
to
get
them
all
at
once
and
fill
the
book
then
it
all
over
the
fun
is
in
collecting
them
slowly
a
few
at
a
time
but
i
want
all
these
patty
so
why
not
take
them
now
no
you
do
either
now
look
here
elise
i
making
your
book
for
you
so
you
take
my
advice
in
this
matter
and
you
afterward
admit
that
i
right
you
always
right
patty
said
elise
smiling
lovingly
at
her
friend
that
the
worst
of
you
but
i
do
as
you
say
this
time
only
do
let
it
occur
again
patty
laughed
and
allowed
elise
to
select
cards
illustrating
the
places
she
had
already
seen
persuading
her
to
leave
the
others
until
some
future
time
then
they
looked
round
the
shop
further
and
discovered
many
attractive
little
souvenirs
to
take
to
friends
at
home
i
think
said
patty
i
just
buy
some
of
these
things
right
now
for
surely
i
could
never
find
anything
for
frank
and
uncle
charlie
better
than
these
queer
little
desk
things
are
they
unusual
elise
are
they
rococo
patty
said
elise
in
a
stage
whisper
i
hate
to
own
up
to
it
but
really
i
never
did
know
what
rococo
meant
is
it
something
like
cloisonne
or
is
it
ormolu
patty
laughed
to
be
honest
elise
i
do
exactly
know
myself
but
i
do
think
you
struck
it
very
closely
however
i
going
to
buy
this
inkstand
i
do
care
if
it
made
of
gingerbread
and
here
a
bronze
napoleon
did
marian
want
that
oh
yes
indeed
she
did
i
so
glad
you
discovered
him
is
he
a
dear
little
man
just
about
three
inches
high
i
believe
the
real
emperor
was
much
more
than
that
is
he
on
a
funny
little
flat
pedestal
it
a
seal
explained
the
shopkeeper
kindly
a
seal
echoed
patty
blankly
why
no
it
is
a
seal
indeed
why
it
is
a
bit
like
a
seal
you
might
just
as
well
call
it
a
teddy
bear
it
a
man
elise
was
giggling
he
does
mean
that
kind
of
a
seal
patty
she
said
he
means
a
seal
to
seal
wax
with
oh
said
patty
giggling
too
why
so
much
the
better
i
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
and
i
glad
it
a
seal
i
can
have
monogram
cut
on
it
and
she
can
seal
her
letters
by
just
letting
napoleon
jump
on
them
she
left
the
order
for
the
monogram
and
the
affable
shopkeeper
promised
to
send
the
finished
seal
home
the
next
day
he
seemed
greatly
interested
in
his
two
young
customers
and
had
it
not
been
for
lisette
sharp
eye
he
would
have
urged
them
to
buy
even
more
of
his
wares
but
the
canny
young
french
girl
had
no
notion
of
letting
her
charges
be
imposed
upon
and
she
glared
haughtily
at
the
shopkeeper
when
he
seemed
too
officious
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
shop
some
young
people
entered
and
to
the
surprise
of
all
they
proved
to
be
the
van
ness
girls
and
their
cousins
the
four
young
people
were
out
by
themselves
and
though
quite
capable
of
finding
their
way
about
alone
lisette
french
notions
were
a
trifle
shocked
at
the
unchaperoned
crowd
but
patty
and
elise
were
so
glad
to
see
their
friends
again
that
they
gave
little
thought
to
conventions
and
fell
to
chattering
with
all
their
might
why
have
you
been
to
see
us
asked
alicia
you
had
our
address
i
know
said
elise
but
we
been
so
busy
ever
since
we
been
here
that
there
has
seemed
to
be
time
for
anything
but
we
glad
to
see
you
now
and
is
it
jolly
that
we
chanced
to
meet
here
yes
indeed
because
we
going
on
on
our
travels
i
mean
and
we
would
have
had
a
chance
to
see
you
again
but
now
that
we
have
met
let
put
in
a
jolly
afternoon
together
where
are
you
going
nowhere
in
particular
we
just
walking
around
paris
that
exactly
our
destination
so
let
go
nowhere
in
particular
together
chapter
xiii
chantilly
this
plan
seemed
to
please
everybody
except
lisette
who
was
a
little
troubled
to
have
her
young
ladies
going
around
with
these
chicago
people
of
whom
she
did
not
quite
approve
but
patty
only
laughed
at
the
anxious
expression
on
the
french
face
she
knew
well
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
and
she
said
to
her
quietly
it
all
right
lisette
they
our
american
friends
and
i
assure
you
farrington
wo
mind
a
bit
since
you
are
with
us
you
dragon
enough
to
chaperon
the
whole
state
of
illinois
it
doubtful
if
lisette
knew
what
the
state
of
illinois
was
but
she
was
devoted
to
patty
and
waved
her
scruples
in
deference
to
wishes
although
she
kept
a
stern
watch
on
the
big
van
ness
boys
but
bob
and
guy
behaved
most
decorously
and
two
more
polite
or
young
men
could
not
have
been
found
among
the
native
parisians
themselves
leaving
the
shop
they
continued
down
the
rue
de
rivoli
till
they
reached
the
louvre
doris
proposed
their
going
in
and
as
patty
was
most
anxious
to
do
so
and
lisette
saw
no
objection
to
visiting
the
great
museum
they
all
entered
it
was
patty
first
glimpse
of
the
great
picture
gallery
and
she
began
to
wish
she
was
not
accompanied
by
the
chattering
crowd
that
she
might
wander
about
wherever
her
fancy
directed
but
she
remembered
she
would
have
ample
opportunity
for
this
all
winter
so
she
willingly
gave
up
her
own
desire
to
please
the
van
ness
girls
they
cared
little
for
pictures
but
were
really
good
historical
students
and
they
wanted
to
visit
the
rooms
which
contained
curios
and
relics
of
famous
people
so
the
whole
crowd
followed
the
lead
of
doris
and
alicia
who
had
visited
the
louvre
before
and
patty
found
herself
learning
a
great
deal
from
the
experienced
way
in
which
the
girls
discussed
the
exhibits
she
found
too
that
historical
relics
were
more
interesting
than
she
had
supposed
and
she
almost
sighed
as
she
thought
of
the
many
things
she
wanted
to
see
and
study
during
the
winter
i
hope
you
be
here
when
we
come
back
guy
van
ness
said
to
her
as
they
stood
together
looking
at
some
old
miniatures
i
hope
so
too
said
patty
when
are
you
coming
i
do
know
exactly
it
depends
on
uncle
plans
but
probably
about
january
oh
yes
we
shall
surely
be
here
then
and
probably
living
in
a
home
of
our
own
of
course
i
mean
a
temporary
home
but
not
a
hotel
i
hope
you
will
come
to
see
us
indeed
i
will
i
wish
we
could
have
seen
more
of
you
this
week
but
uncle
has
rushed
us
about
sightseeing
so
fast
that
there
was
no
time
for
social
calling
we
saw
bert
chester
and
his
crowd
said
patty
and
then
she
told
about
the
day
at
versailles
what
a
lark
exclaimed
guy
i
wish
i
had
been
along
but
you
must
go
somewhere
with
us
when
we
here
in
january
wo
you
i
like
to
said
patty
but
i
ca
promise
it
all
depends
on
the
farringtons
i
their
guest
so
of
course
i
under
their
orders
well
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
we
do
have
some
fun
when
we
come
back
here
declared
guy
and
i
shall
do
all
i
can
to
bring
it
about
when
they
left
the
museum
it
was
getting
late
in
the
afternoon
and
lisette
decreed
that
her
young
ladies
must
go
home
at
once
the
van
ness
crowd
raised
great
objection
to
this
but
lisette
was
obdurate
and
calling
a
cab
she
ushered
the
girls
in
and
then
getting
in
herself
gave
the
order
for
home
patty
could
help
laughing
at
the
serious
way
in
which
lisette
took
care
of
them
but
farrington
told
her
it
was
quite
right
and
she
would
have
been
displeased
had
lisette
done
otherwise
you
do
quite
understand
my
dear
she
said
kindly
the
difference
between
the
conventions
of
paris
and
our
own
new
york
it
may
seem
foolish
to
you
to
be
so
carefully
guarded
but
i
ca
quite
explain
it
to
you
so
you
would
understand
it
and
therefore
i
going
to
ask
you
to
obey
my
wishes
without
question
and
more
than
that
when
lisette
is
temporarily
in
charge
of
you
to
obey
her
indeed
i
will
dear
farrington
said
patty
heartily
and
truly
i
was
rebelling
the
leastest
mite
i
more
than
ready
to
obey
you
or
lisette
either
only
it
struck
me
funny
to
be
put
into
a
cab
like
babies
in
a
by
their
nursemaid
you
a
good
girl
patty
and
i
do
foresee
a
bit
of
trouble
in
taking
care
of
you
i
shall
feel
better
and
i
go
shopping
with
you
girls
myself
and
perhaps
we
may
have
time
to
look
in
at
a
few
other
places
so
patty
danced
away
quite
content
to
take
things
as
they
came
and
sure
that
all
the
coming
days
were
to
be
filled
with
all
sorts
of
novelties
and
pleasures
their
purchases
had
been
sent
home
reaching
there
before
they
did
themselves
and
patty
immediately
fell
to
work
on
the
albums
placing
the
cards
in
the
little
slits
which
were
cut
in
the
leaves
to
receive
them
the
days
flew
by
like
bandersnatches
patty
herself
could
not
realise
what
became
of
them
she
wrote
frequently
to
the
people
at
home
and
tried
to
include
all
of
her
young
friends
in
america
in
her
correspondence
but
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
and
so
finally
she
took
to
writing
long
letters
to
marian
and
asking
her
to
send
the
letters
round
to
the
other
girls
after
she
had
read
them
and
farrington
had
begun
their
search
for
a
furnished
house
which
they
might
rent
for
the
winter
when
they
went
to
look
at
various
ones
suggested
to
them
by
their
agent
they
did
not
take
the
girls
with
them
as
farrington
said
it
was
too
serious
a
matter
in
which
to
include
two
chattering
children
so
patty
and
elise
were
left
pretty
much
to
their
own
devices
while
the
elder
farringtons
went
on
these
important
errands
but
one
bright
morning
when
and
farrington
were
preparing
to
start
off
in
the
automobile
for
the
day
elise
begged
that
she
and
patty
might
be
allowed
to
go
off
on
an
excursion
of
some
sort
indeed
i
think
you
ought
said
farrington
kindly
and
i
tell
you
what
i
think
would
be
a
plan
how
would
you
like
to
go
with
lisette
to
the
chateau
of
chantilly
for
a
day
outing
you
could
go
on
one
of
those
conducted
tours
in
a
big
motor
van
with
lots
of
other
tourists
i
think
it
will
be
lots
of
fun
cried
elise
i
always
wanted
to
climb
up
on
one
of
those
moving
mountains
and
go
wabbling
away
i
too
said
patty
just
for
once
i
think
that
sort
of
thing
would
be
great
fun
then
you
must
hustle
to
get
ready
said
farrington
for
the
cavalcade
sets
off
at
ten
and
i
do
believe
they
wait
even
for
two
nice
little
girls
like
you
so
run
along
and
get
your
bonnets
and
be
sure
not
to
forget
to
remember
to
feed
the
carp
what
is
a
carp
asked
patty
as
she
and
elise
ran
away
to
dress
fish
i
think
said
elise
but
we
probably
find
out
when
we
get
there
the
girls
were
soon
ready
and
with
lisette
they
walked
out
in
the
bright
sunshine
and
along
the
rue
de
la
paix
until
they
came
to
the
corner
where
the
personally
conducted
tourists
were
to
start
from
farrington
had
telephoned
for
tickets
so
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
clamber
into
their
seats
this
was
done
by
mounting
a
stepladder
placed
at
the
side
of
the
big
vehicle
the
seats
of
the
van
were
graduated
in
height
so
that
the
back
ones
were
as
good
as
the
front
and
indeed
a
full
view
of
what
was
passing
could
be
commanded
from
any
position
they
had
to
wait
until
the
tourists
had
all
arrived
and
then
they
started
off
at
a
good
speed
toward
the
country
i
feel
as
if
i
were
riding
in
one
of
the
old
royal
state
carriages
said
patty
although
there
is
the
slightest
resemblance
in
the
vehicle
or
the
means
of
locomotion
no
said
elise
laughing
nor
in
the
people
i
do
believe
these
tourists
bear
much
resemblance
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
rode
in
the
royal
carriages
but
i
think
it
more
fun
than
our
own
car
because
we
sit
up
so
high
and
can
see
everything
so
well
and
hear
too
said
patty
as
they
listened
to
the
man
in
the
front
seat
who
had
turned
around
and
was
announcing
through
a
megaphone
the
names
of
the
places
as
they
passed
them
he
seems
to
know
his
lesson
pretty
well
whispered
patty
but
his
french
pronunciation
is
even
worse
than
mine
your
pronunciation
is
so
bad
patty
but
you
have
any
vocabulary
to
speak
of
to
speak
with
you
mean
but
never
you
mind
miss
as
soon
as
your
respected
parents
decide
upon
a
house
and
we
get
settled
in
it
going
to
study
french
like
anything
and
french
history
too
i
used
to
hate
these
things
but
times
have
changed
since
patty
came
to
paris
i
glad
you
so
energetic
but
i
do
feel
much
like
studying
rather
drift
around
and
have
fun
as
we
are
doing
we
have
time
enough
for
both
and
you
want
to
take
some
painting
lessons
do
you
yes
but
seeing
all
the
pictures
i
seen
since
i
been
here
discourages
me
i
used
to
think
i
was
quite
an
artist
but
i
see
now
that
if
i
ever
do
anything
really
worth
while
i
have
to
begin
all
over
again
and
go
into
a
drudgery
drawing
class
it
wo
be
drudgery
you
love
it
so
and
you
make
rapid
progress
if
you
as
desperately
in
earnest
as
all
that
do
you
think
your
mother
will
decide
to
take
that
house
they
going
to
look
at
yes
i
think
so
her
mind
is
pretty
well
made
up
already
it
must
be
a
lovely
house
judging
from
what
she
says
about
it
it
was
not
very
far
to
chantilly
and
when
they
reached
there
the
girls
were
almost
sorry
that
the
pleasant
ride
was
ended
the
megaphone
gentleman
informed
his
personally
conducted
crowd
that
they
were
to
alight
and
eat
luncheon
before
proceeding
to
the
chateau
the
hotel
where
they
were
to
lunch
was
a
quaint
house
built
around
three
sides
of
a
garden
it
was
called
the
hotel
du
and
patty
said
i
suppose
we
shall
see
and
hear
of
nothing
but
the
condes
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
believe
the
whole
interest
of
chantilly
centres
in
that
conde
crowd
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
it
said
elise
banteringly
i
been
reading
up
confessed
patty
and
besides
la
grande
mademoiselle
has
always
been
one
of
my
favourite
characters
in
french
history
she
was
a
wonderful
woman
and
though
not
of
the
condes
she
is
mixed
up
in
their
history
she
is
an
unknown
quantity
to
me
said
elise
but
i
willing
to
learn
so
tell
me
all
you
know
patty
it
wo
take
long
you
get
no
instruction
from
me
after
that
unflattering
speech
retorted
patty
and
then
luncheon
was
announced
and
the
girls
sat
down
at
the
table
reserved
for
them
they
were
much
interested
in
their
and
as
most
of
them
were
socially
inclined
patty
and
elise
were
included
in
the
general
conversation
as
the
tourists
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
of
general
information
and
as
they
were
quite
ready
to
impart
it
the
girls
picked
up
quite
a
store
of
knowledge
more
or
less
accurate
then
they
left
the
hotel
with
its
quaint
old
gateway
and
carefully
kept
gravel
walks
and
proceeded
on
their
way
to
the
chateau
it
was
necessary
at
the
entrance
to
cross
a
bridge
over
the
moat
and
here
patty
discovered
the
reason
for
feeding
the
carp
to
begin
with
the
carp
themselves
were
exceedingly
old
and
had
been
swimming
around
in
the
same
moat
for
hundreds
of
years
i
not
quite
sure
of
the
number
of
years
volunteered
a
boston
tourist
to
any
one
who
might
listen
but
it
either
hundreds
or
thousands
anyway
the
carp
are
dreadfully
old
they
do
look
it
declared
patty
as
she
leaned
over
the
railing
of
the
bridge
and
watched
the
frisky
fish
darting
around
like
mad
an
old
woman
sat
nearby
with
a
bushel
basket
full
of
french
rolls
which
she
was
willing
to
sell
to
the
tourists
at
prices
which
increased
as
her
stock
of
rolls
decreased
patty
and
elise
bought
a
quantity
of
the
rolls
and
began
the
fun
of
throwing
them
to
the
fishes
it
turned
out
to
be
even
more
fun
than
they
had
anticipated
for
the
moment
a
roll
reached
the
water
scores
of
carp
would
make
a
mad
dash
for
it
and
a
pitched
battle
ensued
for
possession
of
the
bread
sometimes
the
roll
was
torn
to
pieces
in
the
fight
and
sometimes
a
fortunate
carp
would
secure
it
and
swim
away
followed
by
all
the
others
in
angry
pursuit
another
roll
flung
in
would
of
course
divert
their
attention
and
the
squabble
would
begin
all
over
again
the
fun
was
largely
in
watching
the
individual
peculiarities
of
the
fishes
one
sulky
old
thing
disdained
to
fight
but
if
given
a
roll
all
to
himself
he
would
swim
away
with
it
and
sticking
his
head
in
a
small
corner
of
the
stone
parapet
would
eat
it
greedily
while
he
kept
off
the
other
fishes
by
madly
lashing
his
tail
another
brisk
little
fish
did
seem
to
care
to
eat
the
rolls
at
all
but
mischievously
tried
to
prevent
the
others
from
eating
them
and
played
a
general
game
of
interference
the
actions
of
the
fish
were
so
ridiculous
and
the
sport
so
novel
and
exciting
that
the
girls
would
not
leave
until
they
had
bought
up
all
the
rolls
the
old
woman
had
and
thrown
them
down
to
the
comical
carp
the
personal
conductor
of
the
tour
affably
waited
until
the
moat
performance
was
over
and
then
conducted
his
party
inside
the
park
to
the
chateau
though
only
a
toy
affair
compared
with
versailles
chantilly
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
historic
chateaus
of
france
and
is
in
many
respects
a
gem
the
great
paved
court
of
honor
shone
white
in
the
sunlight
and
the
noble
statues
and
sculptures
bore
witness
to
the
art
and
taste
displayed
in
its
construction
chapter
xiv
making
a
home
the
party
was
marshalled
up
on
the
peristyle
where
they
received
collectively
instructions
in
a
loud
voice
to
leave
their
sticks
and
umbrellas
before
entering
the
chateau
patty
and
elise
agreed
that
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
the
situation
was
somewhat
impaired
by
the
personally
conducted
effect
but
they
thought
that
was
compensated
for
by
the
funny
side
of
it
all
the
tourists
followed
the
conductor
like
a
flock
of
sheep
one
or
another
occasionally
straying
away
for
a
time
and
nearly
all
of
them
making
notes
in
little
indeed
some
of
them
were
so
intent
on
their
notes
that
they
merely
gave
glances
at
the
beautiful
things
exhibited
and
spent
most
of
their
time
scribbling
in
their
books
and
referring
to
their
baedekers
the
interior
of
the
chateau
was
delightful
as
patty
had
surmised
it
was
largely
devoted
to
pictures
and
relics
of
the
conde
family
she
was
greatly
pleased
to
discover
a
gallery
of
battles
which
though
not
large
illustrated
the
battles
of
the
great
prince
who
was
called
the
grand
conde
although
patty
was
of
a
peaceful
enough
nature
she
had
a
special
liking
for
the
glory
and
grandeur
of
paintings
of
battle
scenes
and
she
tarried
in
this
gallery
as
long
as
she
could
both
she
and
elise
adopted
the
grand
conde
as
one
of
their
favourites
and
greatly
admired
the
numerous
portraits
of
him
with
his
handsome
face
and
generally
gorgeous
effects
in
one
of
the
halls
of
the
chateau
were
on
sale
and
patty
eagerly
looked
them
over
to
make
the
selection
she
wanted
but
the
personal
conductor
discovered
that
time
was
flying
and
that
if
he
let
all
of
his
charges
delay
over
the
other
sights
must
be
omitted
so
he
scurried
them
along
through
the
various
galleries
and
salons
pausing
in
the
library
and
the
chapel
the
chapel
awed
patty
as
the
impressive
burial
places
of
kings
always
did
and
especially
was
she
interested
in
a
cippus
which
was
a
receptacle
for
the
hearts
of
several
of
the
princes
of
conde
it
seems
wonderful
she
said
to
elise
to
take
out
their
hearts
and
put
them
all
away
together
like
that
but
they
had
strange
ways
in
the
times
of
my
friends
the
condes
i
beginning
to
be
very
much
interested
in
your
friends
the
condes
replied
elise
and
i
think
after
all
i
shall
join
your
french
history
class
this
winter
then
they
proceeded
to
the
beautiful
park
of
chantilly
which
was
laid
out
by
the
same
landscape
gardener
who
afterward
designed
the
gardens
of
versailles
the
park
was
enchanting
and
the
many
buildings
in
it
most
interesting
there
one
thing
certain
said
patty
i
shall
come
here
some
day
and
camp
out
for
the
day
in
this
park
and
wander
around
without
being
personally
conducted
and
i
shall
do
myself
the
honour
to
accompany
you
said
elise
sure
i
can
persuade
father
to
send
us
out
here
in
the
car
some
day
and
let
us
play
around
by
ourselves
all
too
soon
the
megaphone
voice
called
them
to
start
on
their
homeward
trip
patty
and
elise
were
among
the
first
to
take
their
seats
in
the
great
motor
car
and
as
patty
was
looking
over
her
beloved
she
suddenly
discovered
that
she
had
no
portrait
of
her
friend
the
grand
prince
but
by
good
luck
she
saw
a
woman
standing
near
and
suspended
by
a
strap
round
her
neck
was
a
tray
of
calling
the
woman
to
her
patty
made
known
her
desire
for
a
picture
of
the
grand
conde
oui
oui
exclaimed
the
woman
as
she
offered
various
portraits
of
other
members
of
the
conde
family
non
non
cried
patty
shaking
her
head
vigorously
le
grand
prince
grand
conde
at
length
the
woman
discovered
the
proper
card
and
when
patty
accepted
it
and
paid
her
for
it
she
burst
into
voluble
thanks
and
begged
her
to
buy
more
remembering
elise
album
patty
bought
another
copy
of
the
same
picture
for
that
and
then
thinking
she
would
like
to
take
one
to
marian
she
asked
for
a
third
copy
this
the
woman
did
not
have
in
stock
but
anxious
to
please
her
pretty
young
patron
she
flew
over
to
another
vender
of
which
there
seemed
to
be
several
near
by
and
demanded
the
required
card
from
her
but
a
search
through
her
stock
proved
unavailing
and
both
women
chatting
volubly
in
french
tried
to
procure
one
from
a
third
seller
patty
and
elise
became
much
amused
at
the
excitement
they
had
created
and
suddenly
to
their
surprise
one
of
the
tourists
expressed
her
desire
also
for
a
portrait
of
the
grand
conde
patty
surmised
at
once
that
she
had
no
particular
reason
for
desiring
it
save
an
idea
that
if
it
was
in
such
great
demand
it
must
be
of
a
special
value
and
then
following
the
example
of
the
first
several
other
tourists
set
up
a
clamour
for
the
same
picture
and
the
scene
became
one
of
great
excitement
the
venders
put
their
heads
together
and
still
jabbering
rapidly
produced
all
sorts
of
portraits
which
they
endeavoured
to
foist
upon
the
buyers
as
portraits
of
the
grand
prince
but
the
tourists
were
shrewd
and
they
knew
what
they
wanted
though
they
had
no
idea
why
they
wanted
it
the
natural
result
of
this
situation
was
a
rise
in
price
of
the
desired
picture
the
original
price
of
ten
centimes
was
doubled
and
then
quadrupled
and
finally
the
tourists
began
to
bid
for
the
picture
until
the
affair
became
an
auction
patty
and
elise
were
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
absurdity
of
it
all
and
finally
the
motor
man
whizzed
away
leaving
the
frenchwomen
chuckling
over
their
marvelous
sales
and
carrying
some
excited
tourists
who
wondered
why
they
had
paid
so
much
for
ordinary
patty
recital
of
the
affair
at
dinner
that
night
greatly
amused
the
farringtons
and
farrington
declared
that
the
whole
scene
was
typical
of
human
nature
as
you
had
cornered
the
market
patty
he
said
why
did
you
sell
your
conde
pictures
at
top
prices
or
else
put
them
up
at
auction
for
the
very
good
reason
that
i
wanted
them
myself
replied
patty
and
if
i
had
sold
them
perhaps
i
never
could
get
any
more
well
we
too
have
achieved
an
important
success
went
on
farrington
we
have
secured
a
foothold
in
this
somewhat
uncertain
city
and
we
shall
soon
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
that
we
can
call
our
own
for
a
time
at
least
oh
you
took
the
house
then
exclaimed
elise
how
jolly
and
when
are
we
going
there
to
live
as
soon
as
it
can
be
made
habitable
said
farrington
they
call
it
a
furnished
house
but
it
is
not
at
all
my
idea
of
furnishing
about
as
well
appointed
as
a
summer
cottage
might
be
at
home
the
is
all
right
and
the
is
fairly
good
but
the
bedrooms
must
be
almost
entirely
refurnished
some
day
my
children
you
shall
go
shopping
with
me
to
select
things
for
your
own
rooms
this
shopping
expedition
took
place
soon
and
patty
with
her
usual
happy
enthusiasm
thought
it
was
quite
as
much
fun
as
any
other
mode
of
entertainment
farrington
and
the
two
girls
driven
by
the
chauffeur
went
flying
around
in
the
automobile
stopping
now
at
one
beautiful
shop
and
now
at
another
and
buying
lovely
things
it
seems
foolish
said
farrington
to
buy
a
lot
of
furniture
for
a
rented
house
but
we
must
be
comfortable
through
the
winter
and
then
the
prettiest
of
the
things
we
take
back
to
america
with
us
the
girls
were
allowed
to
make
their
own
selections
and
patty
decided
that
her
room
should
be
green
and
white
while
elise
chose
pink
the
girls
had
not
yet
seen
the
house
but
farrington
told
them
that
two
large
rooms
adjoining
each
other
on
the
third
floor
were
to
be
for
their
use
and
though
the
principal
articles
of
furniture
were
already
in
them
they
might
choose
some
pretty
appointments
such
as
or
also
they
selected
some
little
french
gilded
chairs
and
ottomans
patty
thinking
the
while
how
pretty
these
would
look
when
transported
back
to
her
new
york
home
after
about
a
week
more
of
hotel
life
the
farringtons
moved
to
their
own
home
it
was
a
house
on
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
stood
in
a
small
but
out
park
or
garden
there
were
stone
porticos
on
which
opened
long
french
windows
and
the
high
ceilings
and
winding
staircase
with
broad
landings
gave
the
house
an
attractive
though
foreign
air
like
all
french
houses
the
decorations
were
elaborate
and
mirrors
were
everywhere
and
crystal
chandeliers
and
painted
panels
abounded
it
was
all
of
great
interest
to
patty
who
dearly
loved
and
who
saw
great
possibilities
for
the
unusual
combination
of
american
cosiness
in
a
paris
house
farrington
was
delighted
when
she
discovered
patty
capabilities
in
domestic
matters
and
declared
that
she
would
not
wish
for
a
better
assistant
it
was
patty
deft
fingers
that
transformed
stiff
and
formal
rooms
into
apartments
of
real
comfort
and
homelikeness
it
was
very
often
patty
taste
that
selected
simple
decorations
or
ornaments
which
toned
down
the
gorgeousness
of
the
original
scheme
the
two
girls
own
rooms
were
greatly
successful
patty
had
bought
a
number
of
pictures
and
statuettes
and
various
parisian
ornaments
which
she
was
delighted
to
arrange
in
a
room
of
her
very
own
she
helped
elise
with
hers
too
for
though
elise
had
good
taste
and
a
fine
appreciation
of
the
fitness
of
things
she
had
not
patty
capability
of
execution
and
facility
of
arrangement
as
they
sat
for
the
first
time
around
their
own
family
dinner
table
farrington
exclaimed
now
this
is
what
i
call
comfortable
unpretentious
but
it
way
ahead
of
that
gorgeously
hotel
which
made
one
feel
though
well
taken
care
of
like
a
traveller
and
a
wayfarer
but
i
expect
you
were
sorry
to
leave
it
eh
patty
no
i
was
said
patty
i
liked
it
tremendously
for
a
time
as
it
was
a
novel
experience
for
me
but
i
quite
as
pleased
as
you
are
farrington
to
be
in
a
home
once
more
and
the
next
thing
to
do
said
farrington
is
to
get
masters
for
you
girls
shall
we
go
to
school
mother
asked
elise
no
i
think
not
i
do
like
the
idea
of
your
going
to
a
french
school
and
too
i
think
you
enjoy
it
better
to
study
a
little
at
home
you
need
have
a
great
variety
of
lessons
i
think
if
you
study
the
french
language
and
french
history
it
will
be
enough
for
you
in
the
way
of
school
books
then
patty
ought
to
take
singing
lessons
and
if
elise
wants
to
learn
to
paint
pictures
she
will
probably
never
get
a
better
opportunity
to
do
so
this
plan
seemed
to
suit
perfectly
the
young
ladies
most
interested
and
farrington
said
he
would
take
it
upon
himself
to
find
the
right
masters
for
them
so
the
family
settled
down
into
a
life
which
was
quiet
compared
with
the
first
few
weeks
of
their
stay
in
paris
the
masters
came
every
morning
except
saturday
and
that
day
was
always
devoted
to
sightseeing
or
pleasures
of
some
sort
occasionally
too
a
whole
holiday
was
taken
during
the
week
for
farrington
said
he
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
a
certain
proverb
which
discussed
the
result
of
all
work
and
no
play
patty
declared
she
was
never
afraid
of
any
lack
of
play
hours
in
the
farrington
family
and
she
enjoyed
alike
both
her
morning
tasks
and
her
afternoon
pleasures
twice
a
week
a
professor
came
to
give
her
singing
lessons
and
it
was
arranged
that
at
the
same
hour
elise
should
be
busy
with
her
drawing
master
though
elise
did
not
show
promise
of
becoming
a
really
great
artist
her
parents
thought
it
wise
to
cultivate
such
talent
as
she
possessed
if
only
for
the
pleasure
it
might
give
to
herself
and
her
friends
so
elise
worked
away
at
her
drawing
from
casts
and
occasionally
painted
flowers
in
water
colours
while
patty
practised
her
scales
and
learned
to
sing
some
pretty
little
french
ballads
though
neither
of
the
girls
was
possessed
of
genius
they
both
had
talent
and
by
application
to
study
they
found
themselves
rapidly
improving
in
their
arts
as
patty
had
expected
she
developed
an
intense
interest
in
french
history
and
as
elise
shared
this
taste
they
learned
their
lessons
well
and
also
read
books
of
history
outside
of
school
hours
quite
from
choice
illustration
with
caption
they
also
read
books
of
history
outside
of
school
hours
quite
from
choice
there
were
a
great
many
americans
residing
in
paris
and
it
was
not
long
before
and
farrington
renewed
old
acquaintances
there
and
also
made
new
ones
among
the
american
colony
this
meant
pleasant
associates
for
the
girls
and
they
soon
became
acquainted
with
several
american
families
indeed
the
house
next
to
their
own
was
occupied
by
an
american
family
named
barstow
with
whom
the
farringtons
soon
made
friends
the
young
people
of
the
family
were
rosamond
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
her
brother
martin
a
few
years
older
the
first
time
they
met
elise
and
patty
took
a
decided
liking
to
the
barstows
and
rosamond
often
spent
the
afternoon
with
them
while
they
chatted
gaily
over
their
work
or
went
driving
with
them
along
the
beautiful
bois
or
visited
the
galleries
with
them
chapter
xv
germain
the
weeks
went
happily
by
patty
became
quite
accustomed
to
french
ways
and
customs
and
was
becoming
proficient
in
the
language
one
of
her
greatest
treats
was
the
opera
farrington
had
engaged
a
box
for
the
season
and
the
girls
attended
nearly
every
matinee
performance
the
first
few
times
patty
could
scarcely
listen
to
the
music
for
her
admiration
of
the
wonderful
building
but
after
she
became
more
accustomed
to
its
glories
it
did
not
so
distract
her
attention
from
the
stage
and
farrington
occasionally
gave
opera
parties
and
dinner
parties
too
but
the
girls
were
not
allowed
to
attend
these
although
indulgent
in
many
ways
farrington
was
somewhat
strict
about
the
conventions
for
her
young
people
but
so
gently
were
her
rules
laid
down
that
they
never
seemed
harsh
or
stern
on
nights
when
dinner
parties
were
given
the
girls
had
their
dinner
in
the
family
and
often
were
allowed
to
invite
rosamond
and
sometimes
martin
to
their
feasts
another
delight
to
patty
was
the
fact
that
she
was
learning
to
drive
a
it
had
always
fascinated
her
and
she
had
always
felt
that
she
could
do
it
if
she
only
knew
how
once
when
she
timidly
expressed
this
wish
to
farrington
he
replied
why
certainly
child
i
be
glad
to
teach
you
and
some
day
who
knows
you
may
have
a
car
of
your
own
so
whenever
opportunity
allowed
farrington
gave
her
lessons
in
the
art
and
often
patty
would
sit
in
front
with
the
chauffeur
and
he
would
teach
her
many
things
about
the
mechanism
until
she
became
really
quite
accomplished
as
a
driver
of
course
she
was
never
allowed
to
run
the
car
alone
nor
did
she
wish
to
but
it
was
great
fun
to
handle
the
wheel
herself
and
feel
the
car
obey
her
lightest
touch
sometimes
she
would
grow
elated
at
her
success
and
put
on
the
high
speed
but
always
under
the
supervision
and
protecting
guidance
of
farrington
or
the
affable
and
amiable
chauffeur
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
patty
when
she
learned
that
christmas
was
not
made
so
much
of
in
paris
as
with
us
but
that
the
great
was
new
year
day
or
as
they
called
it
jour
de
but
patty
was
not
baffled
by
french
customs
entirely
and
decreed
that
the
farrington
household
should
hold
a
christmas
celebration
all
by
themselves
this
they
did
and
the
day
to
them
was
a
pleasant
one
indeed
but
this
was
a
minor
episode
compared
to
the
fact
that
old
labesse
sent
them
all
an
urgent
invitation
to
come
to
her
at
germain
to
spend
new
year
day
the
girls
were
rejoiced
at
this
invitation
but
feared
they
could
not
accept
it
as
and
farrington
had
an
engagement
in
paris
for
the
festival
but
after
much
discussion
of
the
matter
and
much
pleading
on
the
part
of
the
young
people
it
was
arranged
that
patty
and
elise
should
go
two
days
before
the
new
year
day
and
spend
a
whole
week
with
the
old
in
her
chateau
a
little
tactful
managing
on
patty
part
secured
an
invitation
also
for
rosamond
barstow
and
the
three
girls
who
had
become
almost
inseparable
started
off
together
in
great
glee
farrington
sent
them
out
in
the
in
care
of
his
chauffeur
and
patty
to
her
great
delight
and
satisfaction
drove
the
car
all
the
way
there
germain
is
a
beautiful
town
which
dates
back
about
eight
centuries
when
it
was
a
favourite
summer
residence
of
french
royalty
the
forest
is
among
the
most
beautiful
of
all
french
woods
and
as
patty
drove
through
the
roads
of
the
deep
forest
it
seemed
like
enchanted
ground
they
spun
along
the
terrasse
enjoying
the
view
below
and
after
passing
many
beautiful
villas
and
residences
came
to
the
old
chateau
of
labesse
after
passing
a
porter
lodge
at
the
entrance
they
went
on
for
a
long
distance
through
the
park
before
reaching
the
house
then
alighting
at
the
main
portal
the
doors
were
thrown
open
by
footmen
and
the
girls
were
ushered
in
herself
received
them
in
the
entrance
hall
she
looked
quite
different
from
the
way
she
had
appeared
on
board
the
steamer
as
she
was
now
attired
in
very
elegant
and
formal
robes
with
her
white
hair
arranged
after
the
fashion
of
madame
de
pompadour
she
cordially
welcomed
the
three
young
girls
making
emphatic
assertions
at
her
delight
in
seeing
them
but
her
warmest
welcome
was
bestowed
upon
patty
but
it
is
herself
she
cried
of
a
certainty
it
is
ma
petite
patty
ciel
but
it
is
that
i
am
glad
to
see
you
patty
returned
the
greetings
with
polite
warmth
and
indeed
she
was
really
fond
of
the
quaint
old
lady
the
girls
were
all
amazed
at
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
home
and
were
unable
to
repress
their
admiration
but
was
pleased
rather
than
otherwise
that
they
should
express
their
pleasure
but
surely
she
said
it
is
indeed
the
beautiful
home
this
hall
it
is
not
of
a
smallness
and
in
the
old
days
it
welcomed
royal
guests
the
hall
was
indeed
magnificent
it
was
decorated
with
frescoes
and
mural
paintings
by
french
artists
it
contained
statues
and
paintings
and
clocks
and
vases
that
might
have
graced
a
museum
the
armour
of
knights
stood
about
and
valuable
trophies
graced
the
wainscoted
walls
a
wide
carved
staircase
wound
spirally
up
from
one
end
and
at
suggestion
the
girls
were
ushered
at
once
to
their
room
french
maids
were
sent
to
them
to
unlock
their
boxes
and
assist
with
their
toilettes
and
patty
was
glad
that
she
now
knew
enough
french
at
least
to
make
herself
understood
rosamond
barstow
was
a
girl
who
never
hesitated
to
get
what
she
wanted
if
possible
and
now
it
suited
her
purpose
to
dismiss
the
french
maids
in
her
voluble
if
somewhat
imperfect
french
she
told
them
that
the
young
ladies
wished
to
be
alone
for
a
time
and
would
ring
for
the
maids
later
i
just
had
to
talk
to
you
girls
alone
for
a
minute
she
exclaimed
or
i
should
have
exploded
did
you
ever
see
such
a
gorgeous
castle
in
this
world
i
did
know
your
old
lived
like
this
how
shall
we
ever
live
up
to
it
i
did
know
she
lived
like
this
either
said
patty
laughing
at
rosamond
expressions
and
i
do
care
whether
we
can
live
up
to
it
or
not
we
put
on
our
best
frocks
and
our
best
manners
and
all
we
can
do
but
oh
girls
i
feel
like
a
princess
in
this
room
then
just
come
and
look
at
mine
cried
elise
who
was
in
the
next
apartment
the
girls
had
been
given
rooms
near
each
other
and
which
with
their
anterooms
and
filled
up
the
whole
of
a
large
wing
of
the
chateau
patty
as
she
expressed
it
to
the
other
girls
looked
more
like
a
very
large
cretonne
shirtwaist
box
than
anything
else
for
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
covered
with
a
chintz
tapestry
the
lambrequins
window
curtains
and
door
hangings
were
all
of
the
same
material
and
pattern
and
the
bed
itself
was
draped
and
heavily
curtained
with
the
same
the
bed
curtains
and
window
curtains
were
fastened
back
with
huge
rosettes
of
the
chintz
and
patty
remarked
that
it
must
have
been
brought
by
the
acre
the
furniture
was
of
the
quaintest
old
french
pattern
and
so
and
unusual
were
the
appointments
all
about
that
patty
knew
neither
the
names
nor
the
use
of
many
of
them
i
rather
sleep
in
a
than
in
that
bed
remarked
rosamond
i
know
that
whole
affair
will
tumble
on
your
head
in
the
night
it
perfectly
gorgeous
to
look
at
but
seems
to
me
these
old
things
are
too
old
if
i
were
i
root
them
all
out
and
refurnish
you
be
sent
home
if
heard
you
talk
like
that
admonished
patty
and
i
not
a
bit
afraid
of
that
tent
arrangement
tumbling
down
it
most
picturesque
and
i
shall
lie
in
it
feeling
like
a
retired
empress
come
rosamond
said
elise
call
back
those
comic
opera
maids
you
sent
away
and
let
get
dressed
we
must
keep
waiting
though
i
ever
so
much
rather
perch
up
here
and
talk
by
ourselves
but
she
a
dear
old
lady
and
we
must
do
our
part
as
well
as
she
does
hers
so
rosamond
rang
and
the
maids
came
back
wondering
what
strange
young
demoiselles
they
had
to
wait
upon
now
patty
allowed
herself
to
be
dressed
by
the
maid
and
being
ready
first
stepped
out
on
the
little
balcony
opening
from
her
window
to
wait
for
the
others
a
beautiful
view
met
her
eye
the
lawn
was
terraced
in
many
slopes
and
the
and
shrubberies
though
arranged
with
french
precision
formed
a
beautiful
landscape
there
were
fountains
playing
and
here
and
there
arbours
and
trellises
and
pleasant
paths
but
the
girls
called
to
her
and
patty
joined
them
and
twining
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
they
walked
down
the
broad
staircase
they
were
all
in
white
and
their
pretty
frocks
and
dainty
slippers
made
a
modern
note
that
contrasted
strangely
but
pleasantly
with
the
antique
relics
and
ancient
atmosphere
of
the
chateau
when
they
reached
the
great
hall
a
footman
ushered
them
into
the
grand
where
they
were
to
await
she
soon
appeared
resplendent
in
her
grandeur
and
going
to
greet
her
the
girls
kissed
her
hand
an
old
custom
which
greatly
pleased
their
hostess
but
it
is
of
a
joy
to
see
you
she
exclaimed
me
i
am
so
much
alone
it
is
not
good
to
be
alone
and
yet
it
is
my
choice
i
stay
in
the
home
of
my
ancestors
therefore
i
stay
alone
voila
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
it
was
more
joy
to
live
alone
in
the
old
chateau
than
to
be
anywhere
else
but
i
am
not
always
alone
she
went
on
no
it
is
that
my
henri
my
nephew
comes
to
me
at
occasion
and
he
comes
soon
jour
de
always
brings
him
he
spends
the
day
with
me
he
makes
me
a
pleasure
and
you
shall
see
him
you
young
ladies
ah
how
he
is
beautiful
the
old
lady
clasped
her
hands
and
turned
her
gaze
upward
and
the
girls
were
fain
to
believe
that
her
nephew
was
indeed
a
wonderful
specimen
of
humanity
then
the
dinner
was
announced
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
an
old
footman
who
was
quite
as
dignified
as
she
was
herself
led
the
way
to
the
the
table
appointments
patty
thought
would
have
done
justice
to
any
of
the
most
celebrated
characters
in
french
history
had
they
been
there
to
enjoy
them
although
not
exactly
embarrassed
the
girls
were
a
little
bit
awed
at
splendour
so
unusual
to
them
to
rosamond
it
seemed
distinctly
humorous
that
three
such
young
american
girls
should
be
honoured
guests
in
such
a
regal
household
to
elise
it
seemed
extremely
interesting
and
the
novelty
and
strangeness
of
it
all
impressed
her
more
than
the
grandeur
but
patty
with
her
usual
quick
ability
to
accept
a
situation
seemed
to
take
everything
for
granted
and
made
herself
quite
at
home
the
wonderfully
garbed
footmen
who
stood
behind
their
chairs
like
statues
except
when
they
were
wound
up
nearly
made
rosamond
giggle
but
to
patty
they
were
merely
part
of
the
performance
and
once
accepted
as
such
of
course
they
belonged
in
the
picture
this
readiness
to
adapt
herself
to
any
circumstances
was
inherent
in
patty
nature
and
she
sat
there
and
conversed
with
her
hostess
as
charmingly
and
naturally
as
if
at
a
plainer
board
rosamond
was
much
impressed
by
what
she
chose
to
consider
nerve
and
determining
not
to
be
outdone
she
exerted
herself
to
be
bright
and
entertaining
and
as
elise
was
always
more
or
less
of
a
chatterbox
the
three
girls
provided
much
entertainment
and
their
hostess
was
delighted
with
her
congenial
guests
after
the
rather
lengthy
dinner
was
at
an
end
the
old
took
the
girls
through
various
apartments
and
showed
them
many
of
the
treasures
of
the
chateau
then
they
went
to
the
music
room
and
patty
was
persuaded
to
sing
she
sang
several
songs
and
then
they
all
sang
choruses
together
in
some
of
which
the
old
joined
with
her
thin
but
still
sweet
voice
and
now
she
said
at
last
it
is
to
tear
the
heart
but
i
must
send
you
babies
to
bed
me
i
sleep
so
badly
but
you
young
girls
of
a
surety
must
have
the
tranquil
rest
it
is
then
soir
and
in
the
morning
you
are
to
amuse
yourselves
you
have
but
to
ring
for
your
chocolate
when
you
awake
and
then
pursue
your
own
pleasures
until
noon
when
i
will
meet
you
at
dejeuner
after
affectionate
the
girls
went
to
their
rooms
and
a
half
hour
later
wrapped
in
kimonos
and
with
their
long
braids
hanging
down
their
backs
they
were
all
perched
on
patty
big
bed
alone
at
last
but
it
is
of
a
gorgeousness
exclaimed
rosamond
mimicking
but
not
unkindly
the
old
imperfect
english
me
i
never
have
so
many
feetmen
at
home
is
it
that
you
do
patty
but
i
like
it
all
exclaimed
patty
giggling
at
comical
rosamond
but
standing
up
for
her
own
opinions
of
course
i
not
envious
a
mite
and
i
do
know
even
as
i
care
to
live
in
this
way
all
the
time
but
it
lovely
for
a
few
days
and
i
just
going
to
pretend
i
la
grande
mademoiselle
do
cried
elise
and
i
be
empress
josephine
who
you
be
rosamond
oh
i
be
queen
elizabeth
who
has
come
to
visit
you
nothing
french
about
me
so
there
no
use
pretending
but
i
might
be
an
english
queen
well
josephine
and
elizabeth
you
better
run
to
bed
now
said
patty
for
i
like
the
exclusive
occupancy
of
this
upholstered
myself
amazed
to
find
that
it
was
after
midnight
the
other
girls
ran
laughing
away
and
patty
climbed
in
behind
the
chintz
curtains
almost
persuading
herself
that
she
was
a
royal
princess
after
all
next
morning
the
queen
and
the
empress
came
bounding
in
and
shook
la
grande
mademoiselle
till
she
awoke
this
bed
is
the
biggest
announced
queen
elizabeth
and
so
we
all
going
to
have
our
chocolate
in
here
well
i
like
the
way
you
monopolise
my
apartments
exclaimed
patty
i
glad
you
like
it
said
rosamond
but
we
come
just
the
same
if
you
did
now
stop
your
giggling
while
i
ring
the
bell
and
see
what
happens
a
dainty
french
waitress
answered
the
summons
and
smilingly
asked
for
orders
patty
modestly
asked
for
chocolate
and
rolls
for
them
all
but
the
french
maid
volunteered
the
information
that
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
young
ladies
would
like
an
omelette
and
perhaps
a
jar
of
marmalade
illustration
with
caption
they
were
all
perched
on
patty
big
bed
alone
at
last
heavenly
exclaimed
rosamond
rolling
her
eyes
in
ecstacy
and
the
waitress
departed
on
her
errand
this
is
the
jolliest
picnic
yet
declared
elise
a
little
later
as
she
sat
propped
up
by
pillows
in
a
corner
of
the
big
chintz
tent
and
devoured
flaky
hot
rolls
and
apricot
marmalade
the
girls
were
each
in
a
corner
of
the
great
bed
which
left
ample
room
in
the
centre
for
the
tray
full
of
good
things
and
though
perhaps
an
unusual
place
for
a
picnic
it
was
a
most
hilarious
festivity
chapter
xvi
an
expected
guest
the
three
girls
spent
a
delightful
morning
exploring
the
old
chateau
and
its
park
and
garden
the
clear
air
was
brisk
and
keen
and
a
few
hours
out
of
doors
sent
them
back
into
the
house
with
rosy
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
they
discovered
a
delightful
room
that
they
had
not
seen
before
which
was
built
out
from
one
of
the
wings
and
whose
walls
and
ceiling
were
entirely
of
glass
this
is
something
like
your
room
at
home
elise
said
patty
as
they
seated
themselves
there
not
very
much
my
room
is
glass
to
be
sure
but
it
square
and
this
circular
apartment
is
quite
a
different
matter
and
did
you
ever
see
such
exquisite
furniture
i
can
quite
believe
myself
an
empress
when
i
sit
gracefully
on
this
gilded
blue
satin
sofa
i
glad
you
think
you
sitting
gracefully
said
rosamond
laughing
at
elise
who
in
her
favourite
position
had
one
foot
tucked
up
under
her
i
do
care
said
elise
probably
josephine
would
have
liked
to
sit
on
her
foot
only
she
did
dare
her
empire
would
have
tottered
if
she
had
done
such
a
thing
as
that
observed
patty
but
as
it
tottered
anyway
she
might
as
well
have
sat
as
she
pleased
joined
the
young
people
at
luncheon
time
and
although
she
called
it
breakfast
the
repast
was
quite
as
elaborate
and
formal
in
its
way
as
dinner
had
been
but
the
girls
brought
to
it
three
healthy
young
appetites
that
did
full
justice
to
the
exquisite
viands
set
before
them
at
the
table
announced
to
the
girls
her
plans
for
their
entertainment
it
seemed
that
she
expected
her
nephew
that
evening
to
spend
a
few
days
and
as
the
next
day
would
be
the
great
festival
of
new
day
she
had
planned
a
celebration
of
the
event
so
she
proposed
that
except
for
a
short
automobile
drive
that
afternoon
the
girls
should
rest
and
keep
themselves
fresh
for
when
she
expected
the
arrival
of
her
paragon
of
a
nephew
from
her
description
of
the
young
man
the
girls
were
led
to
think
that
he
must
be
a
sort
of
fairy
prince
in
disguise
and
not
very
much
disguised
either
so
in
the
afternoon
the
three
girls
and
went
for
a
drive
in
one
of
the
great
touring
cars
of
which
had
several
patty
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sit
in
front
with
the
chauffeur
and
rather
astonished
that
impassive
factotum
by
asking
to
be
allowed
to
drive
he
was
very
much
disinclined
to
grant
her
request
lest
it
should
displease
the
old
of
whom
all
her
servants
stood
greatly
in
awe
but
when
patty
appealed
to
her
hostess
and
received
a
not
very
willing
permission
the
chauffeur
allowed
her
to
change
seats
with
him
and
really
drive
the
car
he
was
greatly
surprised
at
patty
skill
and
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
americans
were
a
strange
race
their
route
lay
past
the
railway
station
and
along
the
beautiful
terrace
which
skirts
the
forest
of
germain
on
one
side
and
commands
such
a
marvellous
view
of
the
valley
and
the
seine
returning
home
the
girls
were
left
to
their
own
devices
until
when
they
were
adjured
to
array
themselves
appropriately
to
do
homage
with
the
wonderful
henri
henri
must
be
something
out
of
the
ordinary
declared
elise
when
the
girls
were
alone
probably
not
said
patty
only
thinks
him
so
at
any
rate
i
anxious
to
see
him
declared
elise
for
i
do
know
any
real
live
french
boy
except
that
pauvret
who
was
on
the
steamer
and
he
was
too
lackadaisical
for
any
use
well
i
do
apprehend
henri
will
be
much
better
said
patty
i
do
care
much
about
frenchmen
anyway
what
are
you
going
to
wear
girls
i
shall
wear
my
red
chifon
said
rosamond
it
most
becoming
to
me
i
a
perfect
dream
in
it
and
i
shall
quite
cut
out
you
other
girls
with
our
foreign
prince
pooh
said
elise
he
wo
look
at
you
when
he
sees
me
in
my
white
tulle
i
the
frenchiest
thing
in
that
you
ever
saw
oh
girls
cried
patty
i
going
to
wear
my
light
blue
crepe
de
chine
and
then
we
be
red
white
and
blue
wo
that
be
a
graceful
compliment
to
the
french
colours
as
well
as
to
our
own
dear
flag
long
may
it
wave
cried
rosamond
and
then
following
patty
lead
the
girls
sang
the
star
spangled
banner
with
true
american
heartiness
and
patriotism
this
they
followed
up
with
the
marseillaise
in
which
they
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
maids
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
in
breathless
haste
which
made
her
french
difficult
for
them
to
understand
she
explained
that
had
had
a
telegram
of
dreadful
import
and
would
the
young
ladies
attend
upon
her
at
once
the
maid
ushered
the
wondering
girls
to
apartments
and
found
her
in
her
in
the
hands
of
her
maid
who
was
assisting
her
in
a
hasty
toilette
the
tears
were
rolling
down
the
old
lady
cheeks
and
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
trembling
agitation
ah
mes
enfants
she
cried
but
it
is
news
of
the
most
dreadful
mon
henri
my
nephew
his
arm
it
is
broken
ah
the
sadness
for
the
poor
boy
me
i
fly
to
him
at
once
but
at
once
you
but
you
will
excuse
me
you
will
forgive
because
of
the
dear
boy
i
go
to
paris
but
i
return
bringing
my
boy
with
me
it
was
rather
a
explanation
but
the
girls
finally
gathered
that
henri
had
had
the
misfortune
to
break
his
arm
and
had
sent
for
his
aunt
to
come
to
paris
and
spend
the
new
year
day
with
him
instead
of
taking
his
intended
trip
to
germain
henri
had
not
known
that
his
aunt
had
the
young
ladies
visiting
her
and
so
had
no
idea
that
he
was
disarranging
her
plans
to
such
an
extent
he
can
come
she
exclaimed
bah
it
is
not
his
legs
it
is
but
his
arm
of
a
certainty
one
does
not
walk
on
one
arm
but
the
dear
boy
i
shall
go
to
him
and
explain
all
then
we
will
return
and
there
shall
be
feasting
and
happiness
a
broken
arm
is
not
so
much
it
will
mend
but
to
him
i
must
fly
patty
endeavoured
to
find
out
definitely
the
old
lady
plan
but
she
could
only
gather
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
that
must
catch
the
seven
train
to
be
sure
of
this
she
must
leave
the
house
at
six
and
so
she
started
in
her
swift
touring
car
accompanied
by
her
maid
and
a
groom
in
addition
to
her
capable
and
trusty
chauffeur
away
they
went
and
the
girls
returned
to
the
to
consider
the
situation
it
was
all
over
so
quickly
said
patty
that
i
hardly
know
whether
i
on
my
head
or
my
heels
what
a
whirlwind
is
yes
she
flew
around
like
a
hen
with
its
head
off
or
whatever
french
hens
do
said
rosamond
if
she
whisks
that
boy
home
as
fast
as
she
whisked
herself
off
they
be
here
in
a
minute
she
ca
said
the
practical
elise
if
she
takes
that
seven
train
she
wo
get
to
paris
until
nearly
eight
and
then
i
know
where
the
interesting
invalid
lives
but
anyway
to
kidnap
him
and
get
back
here
again
is
a
matter
of
several
hours
i
do
expect
to
see
them
before
midnight
what
shall
we
do
said
patty
shall
we
have
our
dinner
i
do
believe
we
have
any
say
in
the
matter
volunteered
elise
i
think
that
waxwork
butler
and
the
as
rosamond
calls
them
will
arrange
our
lives
for
us
and
we
be
simply
under
orders
what
an
exciting
experience
exclaimed
patty
to
think
of
us
three
american
girls
alone
except
for
the
servants
in
a
gorgeous
old
french
chateau
i
feel
as
if
i
must
do
something
to
live
up
to
my
privileges
suppose
anything
should
happen
that
never
came
back
suggested
rosamond
we
could
take
possession
of
the
place
and
live
here
forever
i
do
think
much
of
that
plan
declared
patty
new
york
is
good
enough
for
me
as
a
permanent
residence
but
i
do
want
to
do
somethink
in
keeping
with
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
if
there
a
dungeon
keep
on
the
premises
i
think
i
throw
you
two
girls
into
it
after
having
first
bound
you
in
chains
you
mean
a
donjon
keep
patty
said
elise
you
so
careless
with
your
mediaeval
diction
a
noise
in
the
hall
as
of
an
arrival
startled
the
girls
and
rising
impulsively
they
flew
out
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
to
their
astonishment
they
found
the
footmen
holding
open
the
great
front
doors
while
three
stalwart
young
men
entered
the
middle
one
who
was
partly
supported
by
the
other
two
had
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
as
he
was
undoubtedly
a
frenchman
the
girls
were
sure
at
once
that
he
was
no
other
than
the
worshipful
henri
at
sight
of
the
three
astonished
girls
the
three
young
men
looked
equally
amazed
and
whipping
off
their
caps
they
made
profound
bows
to
the
strangers
it
was
a
comical
situation
for
doubtless
henri
had
expected
to
see
his
aunt
and
was
instead
confronted
by
three
unmistakably
american
misses
of
the
six
patty
grasped
the
situation
first
you
are
monsieur
henri
labesse
is
it
not
so
she
said
advancing
toward
the
one
in
her
haste
and
bewilderment
patty
spoke
in
english
forgetting
that
the
young
man
might
not
understand
her
native
tongue
but
he
answered
in
english
quite
as
good
as
her
own
though
with
a
decided
french
accent
yes
mademoiselle
i
am
henri
labesse
i
make
you
my
homage
these
are
my
two
friends
cecil
villere
and
philippe
baring
we
are
glad
to
welcome
you
said
patty
in
her
pretty
frank
way
these
are
my
friends
mademoiselle
farrington
and
mademoiselle
barstow
we
are
guests
of
your
aunt
ah
my
aunt
said
henri
as
the
other
boys
acknowledged
the
introductions
where
is
she
did
she
not
get
my
telegram
she
did
indeed
returned
patty
smiling
and
she
went
flying
off
to
paris
but
my
second
telegram
i
wired
again
saying
i
would
come
here
no
she
did
not
get
your
second
telegram
only
the
first
one
announcing
your
accident
and
she
has
gone
oh
how
dreadful
but
can
we
not
stop
her
let
us
send
post
haste
after
her
it
no
use
said
elise
she
has
been
gone
about
ten
minutes
and
in
her
fast
car
she
is
now
more
than
half
way
to
the
station
did
you
boys
come
in
an
automobile
asked
patty
no
replied
villere
we
came
in
a
rickety
old
cab
from
the
station
and
it
has
gone
back
patty
thoughts
were
flying
rapidly
it
seemed
dreadful
to
let
the
old
go
to
paris
on
a
chase
when
if
she
could
but
be
stopped
and
brought
back
home
it
would
save
the
long
and
troublesome
journey
and
be
a
delight
to
them
all
she
not
only
thought
quickly
but
she
determined
to
act
quickly
can
either
of
you
boys
drive
an
automobile
she
demanded
of
the
two
uninjured
guests
with
voluble
lamentations
the
two
confessed
their
inability
in
that
direction
elise
cried
patty
turning
upon
her
a
look
which
elise
well
knew
demanded
implicit
obedience
you
stay
right
here
and
play
you
the
hostess
of
this
chateau
and
see
that
you
do
it
properly
rosamond
you
come
with
me
without
a
further
glance
at
the
astonished
young
men
without
a
word
to
the
pompous
butler
who
was
hovering
in
the
background
patty
grasped
rosamond
by
the
arm
and
pulled
her
away
with
her
chapter
xvii
a
motor
ride
bareheaded
and
still
dragging
the
astonished
rosamond
patty
rushed
outdoors
into
the
gathering
dusk
and
down
toward
the
stables
confronting
an
astonished
groom
she
asked
him
in
forcible
if
not
entirely
correct
french
whether
there
was
an
assistant
chauffeur
or
any
groom
who
could
run
a
motor
car
she
was
informed
that
there
was
not
that
chauffeur
himself
and
the
groom
who
had
accompanied
him
were
the
only
ones
in
the
establishment
who
knew
anything
about
automobiles
if
mademoiselle
desired
a
coach
now
but
mademoiselle
did
not
desire
a
coach
and
moreover
mademoiselle
seemed
to
know
perfectly
well
what
she
did
desire
beckoning
to
the
groom
who
followed
her
she
went
straight
to
the
garage
where
the
automobiles
were
kept
there
was
a
touring
car
there
almost
the
same
as
the
one
she
had
driven
that
afternoon
and
patty
looked
at
it
uncertainly
there
was
also
a
small
runabout
but
that
was
of
a
different
make
of
which
she
knew
nothing
get
in
she
said
briefly
to
the
groom
and
she
pointed
to
the
tonneau
accustomed
to
implicit
obedience
the
groom
got
in
hatless
as
he
was
and
folding
his
arms
stiffly
sat
up
as
straight
as
if
it
were
a
most
usual
experience
hop
up
in
front
rosamond
went
on
patty
and
do
try
to
stop
me
for
i
going
to
do
exactly
this
i
going
to
the
station
and
catch
before
she
gets
on
that
seven
train
there
second
to
spare
we
ca
even
get
our
hats
and
if
we
should
stop
to
talk
it
over
with
anybody
there
be
no
use
in
going
at
all
now
hush
up
rosamond
do
say
a
word
to
me
i
all
i
can
do
to
manage
this
thing
as
rosamond
had
said
a
word
patty
need
not
have
insisted
on
her
silence
but
patty
was
so
excited
that
it
made
her
quick
of
speech
and
a
little
uncertain
of
temper
she
started
slowly
out
of
the
garage
trying
to
remember
exactly
the
instructions
she
had
so
often
received
about
starting
they
went
safely
out
into
the
park
road
and
along
toward
the
porter
lodge
heart
beat
fast
as
she
wondered
uncertainly
whether
the
porter
would
open
the
gate
for
her
or
not
but
she
carried
off
matters
with
a
high
hand
and
ordered
in
the
name
of
labesse
that
the
gate
be
opened
and
it
was
through
it
they
went
and
out
on
to
the
high
road
patty
put
on
a
higher
speed
and
they
flew
along
like
mad
now
you
can
speak
if
you
want
to
rosamond
she
said
in
a
strained
tense
voice
or
no
perhaps
you
better
not
either
something
the
matter
the
engine
thumps
but
it
all
right
i
know
what
to
do
if
only
the
road
keeps
smooth
if
we
come
to
no
ditches
if
we
do
burst
a
tire
speak
to
me
rosamond
do
for
goodness
sake
say
something
it
all
right
patty
said
rosamond
in
a
quiet
voice
for
she
knew
that
the
greatest
danger
that
threatened
patty
was
her
own
you
all
right
patty
keep
on
just
as
you
are
be
careful
of
this
down
grade
and
you
can
easily
take
the
next
hill
good
for
you
rosamond
said
patty
with
a
really
natural
laugh
you
a
brick
my
nerves
are
strained
but
i
wo
think
of
that
i
think
only
of
my
car
oh
rosamond
if
only
the
road
is
bad
in
any
place
it
is
patty
the
road
is
perfect
steady
now
dear
there
a
motor
coming
but
you
can
easily
pass
it
do
you
reverse
or
something
keep
still
rosamond
do
keep
still
i
know
what
to
do
rosamond
kept
still
on
they
flew
the
wind
in
their
faces
cutting
like
a
cold
blast
their
hair
became
loosened
as
it
streamed
back
from
their
foreheads
it
was
the
excitement
of
danger
and
down
in
their
hearts
both
girls
were
enjoying
it
though
they
did
not
realise
it
at
the
moment
what
the
statuesque
groom
who
sat
up
behind
felt
nobody
will
ever
know
he
kept
his
head
up
straight
and
his
arms
folded
and
his
face
showed
a
brave
expression
though
there
was
nobody
to
notice
it
oh
rosamond
patty
went
on
still
in
that
breathless
gasping
voice
if
i
only
knew
what
time
it
was
there
no
use
whizzing
at
this
speed
if
we
not
going
to
make
the
train
after
all
if
i
thought
it
would
be
of
any
use
i
coast
down
this
hill
but
why
should
we
kill
ourselves
if
we
do
accomplish
our
object
patty
do
be
a
goose
and
again
rosamond
cool
tones
acted
as
a
dash
of
cold
water
on
patty
overstrung
nerves
tell
you
what
time
it
is
you
keep
right
on
with
your
knitting
and
i
can
get
out
my
watch
as
easily
as
anything
and
the
next
time
we
pass
a
light
i
inform
you
the
hour
reassured
by
rosamond
sense
and
nonsense
patty
drove
steadily
on
it
five
minutes
to
seven
announced
rosamond
quietly
but
we
can
already
see
the
railroad
lights
in
the
distance
and
besides
the
train
is
sure
to
be
late
but
patty
you
ca
go
quite
so
fast
as
we
get
into
the
town
you
mus
you
be
arrested
they
ca
catch
me
cried
patty
as
she
flew
on
and
do
keep
still
rosamond
for
goodness
sake
keep
still
rosamond
smiled
to
herself
at
patty
command
to
her
to
keep
still
for
she
well
knew
it
was
merely
a
nervous
exclamation
and
meant
nothing
on
they
went
patty
sounding
the
horn
when
it
was
unnecessary
and
failing
to
sound
it
when
it
was
needed
but
this
made
no
difference
in
their
speed
fortunately
they
met
very
few
vehicles
of
any
sort
and
had
the
good
luck
not
to
run
over
any
dogs
but
as
they
came
in
full
view
of
the
station
they
saw
the
train
also
approaching
from
the
other
direction
patty
knew
that
she
had
just
about
time
to
cross
the
track
but
no
more
instead
of
worrying
her
this
sudden
last
responsibility
seemed
to
steady
her
nerves
and
she
said
quietly
it
all
right
rosamond
do
speak
please
we
just
time
to
cross
the
track
safely
safely
see
i
open
up
the
throttle
just
a
little
more
power
and
here
we
go
bounding
over
the
track
they
seemed
to
jump
over
the
track
and
with
a
round
turn
patty
made
the
corner
put
on
the
brake
and
came
to
a
full
stop
at
the
station
just
as
the
funny
little
french
train
wheezed
in
but
the
girl
could
do
no
more
as
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
hands
dropped
from
the
wheel
and
she
promptly
fainted
away
with
no
notion
of
losing
the
game
at
the
last
moment
rosamond
sprang
from
the
car
calling
to
the
groom
to
look
out
for
patty
and
then
ran
panting
to
the
train
she
grasped
the
old
as
she
was
about
to
step
on
the
train
and
forcibly
pulled
her
away
owing
to
the
old
lady
angry
and
excited
exclamation
at
being
thus
detained
she
could
not
understand
what
rosamond
was
trying
to
tell
her
make
her
comprehend
she
cried
to
the
maid
who
was
accompanying
her
mistress
make
her
understand
quick
she
must
not
go
to
paris
monsieur
henri
is
at
the
chateau
but
the
french
maid
could
understand
no
english
and
in
despair
rosamond
turned
to
the
group
of
people
who
had
gathered
about
them
her
dignity
suddenly
returned
and
her
common
sense
with
it
will
somebody
who
can
talk
french
she
said
explain
to
this
lady
that
she
need
not
go
to
the
house
of
her
nephew
with
the
broken
arm
because
he
is
already
at
the
chateau
of
his
aunt
the
moment
she
had
uttered
this
sentence
its
resemblance
to
the
ollendorff
exercises
struck
rosamond
as
very
funny
and
she
began
to
giggle
but
the
old
at
last
understood
the
state
of
the
case
and
her
face
beaming
with
smiles
she
turned
away
from
the
train
and
back
to
the
station
patty
had
come
to
herself
after
her
momentary
unconsciousness
and
was
all
right
once
more
though
physically
tired
from
her
exciting
exertions
own
chauffeur
was
overcome
with
amazement
when
he
learned
what
patty
had
done
and
took
off
his
cap
to
her
with
the
air
of
one
offering
homage
to
a
brave
heroine
as
for
she
petted
patty
and
cried
over
her
and
thanked
her
and
blessed
her
to
an
extent
that
could
not
have
been
exceeded
had
patty
saved
her
from
the
guillotine
then
patty
was
packed
into
the
back
seat
of
the
big
car
with
on
one
side
of
her
and
rosamond
on
the
other
and
with
this
precious
freight
the
chauffeur
started
off
leaving
the
groom
who
had
gone
with
the
first
party
to
bring
home
the
other
car
though
there
was
not
much
talking
done
on
the
way
home
held
patty
hand
closely
clasped
in
her
own
and
the
girl
felt
well
repaid
by
the
old
lady
unspoken
gratitude
for
the
trouble
and
danger
she
had
undergone
when
they
reached
home
and
had
warmly
welcomed
her
nephew
there
was
great
over
patty
daring
journey
all
well
that
ends
well
said
elise
but
you
catch
it
patty
fairfield
when
mother
hears
of
your
performance
if
i
had
been
in
rosamond
place
you
would
have
had
to
drive
that
car
out
over
my
dead
body
that
why
i
did
take
you
elise
said
patty
laughing
i
knew
you
raise
a
terrible
row
about
my
going
while
rosamond
obeyed
my
orders
like
a
meek
little
lamb
you
should
at
least
have
let
me
accompany
you
mademoiselle
fairfield
said
philippe
baring
i
can
not
drive
an
automobile
i
regret
to
say
but
i
might
have
been
a
protection
for
you
patty
did
see
any
especial
way
in
which
baring
could
have
protected
her
but
she
did
say
so
and
only
thanked
him
prettily
for
his
interest
in
her
welfare
henry
labesse
was
enthusiastic
in
his
admiration
and
praise
of
patty
and
declared
that
american
girls
were
wonders
was
so
pleased
to
think
she
had
been
saved
a
useless
trip
to
paris
and
to
think
that
she
should
be
able
now
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
young
guests
and
above
all
to
think
that
her
beloved
nephew
was
with
her
that
she
hovered
around
like
an
excited
butterfly
from
one
to
another
then
she
sent
them
all
away
to
dress
for
dinner
which
though
belated
was
to
be
a
merry
feast
and
indeed
it
proved
so
old
came
down
first
and
stood
in
the
grandest
to
receive
her
honoured
guests
the
three
boys
came
next
in
their
immaculate
evening
dress
which
henri
had
managed
to
get
into
in
spite
of
his
sling
then
came
the
girls
the
three
as
usual
walking
side
by
side
with
their
arms
about
each
other
they
had
carried
out
their
plan
of
red
white
and
blue
dresses
and
made
a
pretty
picture
as
they
entered
the
and
bowed
in
unison
to
their
hostess
the
dinner
was
especially
elaborate
as
to
decorations
and
confections
that
would
please
the
young
people
and
the
chef
had
done
his
very
best
to
make
his
part
of
the
occasion
a
worthy
one
henri
labesse
proved
to
be
an
exceedingly
jolly
young
man
quite
bubbling
over
with
gay
spirits
and
witty
sallies
he
did
not
hesitate
to
joke
with
his
aunt
who
notwithstanding
her
dignity
was
never
offended
at
her
nephew
bantering
speeches
the
other
two
boys
though
a
trifle
more
formal
than
henri
and
perhaps
a
little
bit
shy
after
the
manner
of
very
young
frenchmen
were
willing
to
do
their
share
and
as
our
three
american
girls
were
in
the
highest
of
spirits
the
feast
was
a
gay
one
indeed
gazed
around
at
her
brood
with
such
delight
and
satisfaction
that
she
almost
forgot
to
eat
over
and
over
again
she
wanted
it
explained
to
her
how
henri
had
broken
his
arm
in
his
gymnasium
class
how
he
had
thought
he
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
germain
and
so
had
telegraphed
his
aunt
to
come
to
him
and
how
later
the
doctor
had
patched
him
up
so
that
he
could
go
and
he
had
followed
close
upon
the
heels
of
a
second
telegram
the
delayed
message
arrived
while
they
were
at
dinner
and
henri
twisted
it
up
and
lighting
it
at
a
candle
flame
burned
it
saying
it
was
a
bad
spirit
which
had
worked
them
ill
but
which
should
trouble
them
no
more
then
wanted
to
hear
again
all
about
patty
wonderful
ride
the
difficulties
she
had
encountered
the
nerve
strain
she
had
experienced
and
the
help
and
comfort
rosamond
had
been
to
her
and
concluded
patty
as
she
wound
up
her
recital
i
do
want
any
one
to
tell
farrington
about
it
because
i
want
to
tell
her
myself
elise
smiled
for
she
well
knew
that
patty
wheedlesome
ways
would
persuade
farrington
to
look
leniently
on
the
episode
although
it
had
indeed
been
a
desperately
dangerous
piece
of
business
but
labesse
asserted
that
after
she
had
said
what
she
had
to
say
to
farrington
she
knew
that
patty
would
not
be
reprimanded
by
her
but
rather
be
deemed
worthy
of
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
patty
smiled
at
them
all
in
reality
caring
little
even
if
she
were
reprimanded
she
knew
she
had
done
a
daring
thing
but
she
had
kept
her
head
and
had
come
through
it
safely
and
having
won
she
felt
it
was
her
right
to
laugh
are
all
american
girls
so
brave
and
fearless
inquired
villere
i
think
most
of
them
are
said
patty
but
you
must
understand
i
was
not
recklessly
daring
i
have
had
many
lessons
in
motoring
and
i
a
fairly
expert
driver
of
course
everybody
is
liable
to
accidents
and
i
took
my
chances
on
them
but
not
on
my
driving
you
took
chances
on
losing
your
head
remarked
rosamond
so
did
marie
antoinette
returned
patty
saucily
but
you
see
i
fared
better
than
she
did
chapter
xviii
a
new
year
fete
the
next
morning
was
the
day
of
the
new
year
as
usual
every
one
did
as
he
or
she
chose
during
the
morning
hours
but
luncheon
time
brought
them
all
together
again
the
three
boys
had
been
out
of
doors
all
the
morning
and
seemed
glad
to
return
again
to
the
society
of
the
american
strangers
the
girls
had
been
happy
enough
by
themselves
and
though
they
liked
the
french
boys
well
enough
had
privately
agreed
that
they
were
not
half
as
nice
as
american
boys
but
half
a
dozen
young
people
if
and
enthusiastic
are
bound
to
have
a
merry
time
together
and
as
the
six
grew
better
acquainted
their
national
differences
wore
away
somewhat
announced
that
the
fete
of
the
day
would
be
an
early
evening
party
followed
by
a
supper
she
had
invited
the
neighbouring
gentry
both
young
and
old
as
was
her
custom
on
jour
de
and
as
she
explained
she
was
making
it
more
of
an
elaborateness
this
year
by
asking
her
guests
to
come
in
fancy
costumes
this
delighted
the
girls
for
they
all
loved
dressing
up
but
they
had
no
notion
where
their
fancy
costumes
were
to
come
from
but
replied
it
is
arranged
and
during
the
afternoon
she
led
them
to
a
large
apartment
which
she
called
the
room
of
the
robes
here
she
displayed
to
the
enraptured
girls
costume
after
costume
of
wonderful
beauty
and
magnificence
the
labesse
line
had
been
a
long
one
and
apparently
its
ladies
had
never
worn
out
or
given
away
any
of
their
robes
nor
its
men
either
for
there
were
costumes
of
knights
and
courtiers
some
of
which
would
surely
fit
the
three
young
men
at
present
under
the
chateau
roof
the
girls
were
bewildered
at
the
maze
of
costumes
and
scarcely
knew
which
to
select
finally
patty
chose
a
bewitching
watteau
affair
with
a
short
quilted
petticoat
and
a
looped
overdress
made
of
the
daintiest
flowered
silk
imaginable
the
petticoat
was
of
white
satin
and
the
overdress
of
palest
blue
with
garlands
of
pink
roses
the
pointed
bodice
laced
up
over
a
dainty
neckerchief
and
it
was
further
adorned
with
borders
of
pearls
rosamond
pounced
upon
a
scarlet
and
gold
brocade
which
she
declared
was
her
ideal
of
a
perfect
gown
elise
found
a
pink
brocatelle
embroidered
with
silver
and
after
they
had
selected
fans
and
many
accessories
to
their
costumes
they
scurried
away
to
their
own
rooms
to
try
them
on
are
we
having
the
time
of
our
life
exclaimed
rosamond
as
she
peacocked
about
gazing
over
her
shoulder
at
her
long
court
train
yes
indeed
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
i
adore
this
performance
and
really
girls
those
boys
are
quite
human
under
their
french
polish
they
not
so
bad
said
elise
if
only
they
would
bow
so
often
and
so
exactly
like
dancing
masters
well
it
all
fun
said
patty
and
i
going
to
get
that
awfully
nice
francoise
to
do
my
hair
she
can
make
it
just
like
an
old
french
picture
would
you
powder
it
no
said
elise
after
a
moment
consideration
the
powder
shakes
off
all
over
everything
and
you
ca
make
it
really
white
anyway
and
besides
patty
your
hair
is
too
pretty
a
colour
to
disguise
with
powder
thank
you
for
the
compliment
elise
though
a
little
belated
all
right
then
i
leave
my
tresses
their
natural
shade
and
decorate
them
with
strings
of
pearls
and
light
blue
ostrich
tips
the
pearls
and
feathers
and
the
manipulations
of
franchise
artistic
fingers
transformed
patty
head
into
the
semblance
of
an
old
french
miniature
and
even
patty
herself
cast
an
approving
glance
at
the
pretty
reflection
in
the
mirror
the
girls
were
wild
with
enthusiasm
over
patty
appearance
though
truth
to
tell
their
own
effects
were
scarcely
less
picturesque
but
patty
style
lent
itself
peculiarly
well
to
the
watteau
dress
and
her
little
feet
with
their
dainty
silk
stockings
and
slippers
twinkled
beneath
the
quilted
petticoat
with
all
the
grace
of
a
real
watteau
picture
when
they
were
ready
they
walked
down
stairs
single
file
with
great
pomp
and
dignity
to
find
awaiting
them
three
polished
young
courtiers
who
might
have
belonged
to
the
court
of
versailles
herself
was
scarcely
disguised
for
in
her
ordinary
costume
she
never
strayed
very
far
from
the
styles
and
materials
of
her
beloved
ancestors
but
she
had
on
a
royal
robe
with
a
great
jewelled
collar
and
strings
of
gems
depending
from
her
throat
she
wore
a
coronet
that
had
belonged
to
some
of
the
ladies
of
her
family
and
she
seemed
more
than
ever
a
chatelaine
of
a
bygone
day
the
rooms
were
decorated
with
flowers
and
plants
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
hundreds
of
wax
lights
added
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
scene
an
orchestra
of
stringed
instruments
played
delightful
music
and
patty
tried
to
forget
entirely
that
she
lived
in
the
twentieth
century
and
pretended
that
time
had
been
turned
back
many
many
years
the
guests
began
to
arrive
and
though
their
costumes
were
of
great
variety
they
were
nearly
all
of
french
effects
and
quite
in
harmony
with
the
scene
patty
did
not
seem
to
care
much
to
converse
or
even
to
dance
but
wandered
around
in
a
blissful
state
enjoying
the
picturesque
scene
probably
i
shall
never
see
anything
like
this
again
she
thought
to
herself
and
i
just
want
to
gaze
at
it
until
it
is
photographed
on
my
mind
forever
oh
wo
it
be
fun
to
tell
nan
and
papa
about
it
just
then
she
saw
henri
labesse
approaching
her
i
fear
i
shall
be
awkward
mademoiselle
he
said
glancing
at
his
arm
in
a
sling
but
if
you
would
forgive
and
dance
with
me
just
once
of
course
i
will
said
patty
her
kind
heart
full
of
sympathy
for
the
poor
fellow
we
can
manage
quite
nicely
i
sure
henri
put
his
good
arm
round
patty
waist
and
lightly
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
they
glided
away
like
most
frenchmen
young
labesse
was
a
perfect
dancer
and
as
patty
was
skilled
in
the
art
they
danced
beautifully
together
and
seemed
to
be
in
no
way
impeded
by
the
young
man
broken
arm
what
a
dance
exclaimed
patty
as
the
music
stopped
i
never
met
any
one
who
dances
as
well
as
you
do
if
you
dance
like
that
with
one
arm
what
would
do
with
two
all
the
merit
of
my
dancing
was
due
to
my
partner
said
henri
with
one
of
his
best
bows
you
are
like
a
fluff
of
thistledown
or
a
will
o
the
wisp
forgive
me
but
i
had
imagined
that
american
ladies
danced
like
like
automobiles
patty
laughed
if
you
had
already
paid
me
such
a
pretty
compliment
she
said
i
should
be
angry
with
you
for
that
speech
but
if
you
wish
to
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
go
and
dance
with
elise
and
rosamond
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
american
dancing
henri
went
away
obediently
leaving
patty
to
decide
among
the
group
of
partners
who
were
begging
her
for
a
dance
later
on
henri
returned
you
are
right
he
said
gravely
the
american
demoiselles
are
indeed
divine
dancers
but
may
i
say
it
they
are
yet
not
like
you
will
you
not
give
me
one
more
turn
and
then
i
must
dance
no
more
my
aunt
forbids
it
on
the
absurd
score
that
i
an
invalid
willingly
patty
danced
again
with
the
young
man
and
as
this
time
it
was
a
fancy
dance
the
exquisite
grace
of
the
couple
soon
attracted
the
attention
of
the
onlookers
one
by
one
the
other
couples
ceased
dancing
until
at
last
patty
and
henri
were
alone
upon
the
waxed
floor
while
the
others
looked
admiringly
on
inspired
by
the
moment
patty
indulged
in
some
fancy
steps
which
were
quickly
understood
and
repeated
by
henri
and
depending
on
a
whispered
word
now
and
then
for
direction
they
advanced
and
retreated
bowed
and
chasseed
in
an
elaborate
and
exquisite
minuet
henri
disabled
arm
so
far
from
being
an
obstacle
to
his
grace
seemed
to
lend
a
certain
quaint
dignity
to
his
movements
and
in
his
court
dress
he
looked
like
a
wounded
knight
who
had
returned
triumphant
from
the
tourney
to
dance
with
his
fair
lady
great
applause
followed
the
final
figure
of
their
dance
and
henri
led
pretty
patty
blushing
with
the
honours
heaped
upon
her
to
his
aunt
the
old
kissed
her
dear
little
friend
and
the
tears
in
her
eyes
told
patty
how
much
she
had
enjoyed
the
scene
then
came
the
feast
which
was
all
gaiety
and
merriment
and
finally
by
general
acclamation
patty
was
about
to
be
crowned
queen
of
the
new
year
this
however
she
would
not
allow
and
taking
the
crown
which
was
offered
her
she
went
over
and
placed
it
on
the
white
hair
of
her
hostess
remarking
that
was
queen
and
she
herself
the
first
lady
in
waiting
the
picture
of
pretty
patty
as
she
stood
by
the
side
of
the
regal
old
lady
who
sat
crowned
in
her
own
chair
of
state
was
worthy
of
a
painter
and
many
who
saw
it
wished
it
might
have
been
transferred
to
canvas
the
festival
broke
up
early
for
the
old
would
not
allow
late
hours
for
her
children
and
as
soon
as
the
last
guest
was
gone
she
sent
them
scampering
to
bed
with
strict
injunctions
for
them
not
to
reappear
until
noon
the
next
day
the
next
day
was
ushered
in
by
a
dismal
pouring
rain
and
certain
outdoor
pleasures
which
were
planned
for
the
afternoon
had
to
be
given
up
but
i
tell
you
what
we
will
do
announced
patty
as
they
gathered
in
the
great
hall
after
luncheon
we
have
an
afternoon
of
american
fun
and
we
show
you
french
boys
some
tricks
you
never
saw
before
having
asked
permission
from
who
would
not
have
refused
her
had
she
asked
to
build
a
bonfire
on
the
carpet
patty
took
her
friends
to
the
kitchen
the
fat
old
chef
was
amazed
but
greatly
pleased
that
the
american
demoiselles
should
honour
his
precincts
and
he
put
himself
his
assistants
and
all
his
pantries
at
their
service
first
said
patty
we
going
to
have
a
candy
pull
the
french
boys
had
no
notion
what
a
candy
pull
might
be
but
they
were
more
than
willing
to
learn
a
difficulty
arose
however
when
patty
undertook
to
explain
to
old
cesar
the
chef
that
she
wanted
molasses
she
did
know
the
french
word
for
molasses
and
when
she
tried
sirop
cesar
affably
flew
around
and
brought
her
such
a
variety
of
sirops
that
she
was
overwhelmed
nor
were
they
of
any
use
to
her
for
they
were
merely
sweet
essences
of
various
fruits
and
nothing
like
good
old
new
orleans
molasses
cesar
was
desolate
that
he
could
not
please
patty
and
berated
his
assistants
down
to
the
scullion
for
not
knowing
what
the
american
young
lady
wanted
as
soon
as
he
could
for
laughter
henri
helped
matters
out
by
explaining
that
what
was
desired
was
melasse
ah
oui
oui
oui
exclaimed
the
delighted
cesar
and
he
sent
the
kitchen
boys
flying
for
the
right
thing
at
last
laughing
herself
at
the
absurdity
of
making
molasses
candy
with
the
assistance
of
half
a
dozen
french
cooks
patty
proceeded
to
measure
out
cupfuls
of
the
treacle
and
pour
it
into
a
skillet
she
was
enchanted
with
the
immaculate
purity
and
spotlessness
of
the
french
kitchen
which
even
that
of
a
new
england
housewife
can
not
rival
she
had
set
the
boys
to
cracking
nuts
and
picking
them
out
and
when
the
time
came
she
added
butter
and
a
dash
of
vinegar
to
her
boiling
candy
watched
with
great
interest
by
cesar
whose
french
repertoire
did
not
include
any
such
strange
mess
as
this
after
the
candy
was
poured
out
into
the
pans
and
partly
cooled
the
pulling
began
patty
never
liked
this
part
of
the
performance
herself
and
she
frankly
said
so
stating
that
if
the
others
wanted
to
pull
the
taffy
she
would
show
them
how
elise
declined
but
rosamond
pulled
away
briskly
using
only
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
with
a
practiced
touch
until
her
portion
of
candy
became
of
a
beautiful
cream
colour
and
then
almost
white
after
watching
her
a
few
moments
cesar
caught
the
trick
and
taking
a
large
panful
pulled
and
tossed
it
about
with
such
dexterity
that
they
all
applauded
henri
of
course
could
not
join
in
the
sport
but
philippe
and
cecil
undertook
it
bravely
though
meeting
with
difficulties
they
soon
gave
it
up
it
is
a
knack
said
patty
and
though
i
can
do
it
fairly
well
i
hate
it
because
it
so
messy
but
cesar
is
an
artist
at
it
so
suppose
we
let
him
do
the
rest
cesar
willingly
consented
to
this
plan
and
the
young
people
ran
away
leaving
him
to
finish
the
taffy
next
said
patty
as
after
much
washing
of
hands
they
had
again
assembled
in
the
glass
parlour
i
going
to
teach
you
to
play
bean
bags
elise
and
rosamond
set
up
a
shout
of
laughter
at
this
and
the
boys
looked
politely
inquisitive
calling
a
footman
patty
who
greatly
enjoyed
the
joke
of
being
waited
upon
to
such
an
absurd
degree
asked
him
pleasantly
to
bring
her
some
beans
she
chose
her
french
carefully
designating
what
she
wanted
by
the
term
haricots
oui
mademoiselle
said
the
obsequious
footman
hurrying
away
on
his
errand
he
quickly
returned
bearing
a
tin
of
french
beans
on
a
silver
tray
patty
burst
into
laughter
and
so
did
the
rest
of
them
though
only
elise
and
rosamond
knew
what
the
joke
was
about
non
non
exclaimed
patty
between
her
peals
of
laughter
beans
beans
oh
wait
a
minute
i
tell
you
i
tell
you
stop
let
me
think
after
a
moment
hard
thought
she
triumphantly
exclaimed
feve
oui
oui
oui
exclaimed
the
footman
comprehendingly
and
away
he
stalked
once
more
this
time
he
returned
with
a
large
silver
dish
full
of
coffee
beans
neither
roasted
nor
ground
these
patty
accepted
with
many
thanks
i
do
believe
she
said
that
they
have
real
beans
in
this
benighted
country
and
these
will
answer
the
purpose
just
as
well
then
again
summoning
her
best
french
to
her
aid
she
asked
the
footman
to
procure
for
her
some
pieces
of
material
cloth
or
cotton
and
she
indicated
the
size
with
her
finger
also
asking
him
to
bring
a
then
with
an
exhausted
air
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
waited
patty
you
do
beat
the
dutch
said
elise
you
know
he
ca
find
such
things
ca
he
said
patty
complacently
something
tells
me
that
that
able
footman
will
return
with
material
for
the
boys
were
looking
on
with
great
amusement
though
only
half
understanding
what
it
was
all
about
they
understood
english
and
nearly
all
of
patty
french
but
was
an
unknown
word
to
them
true
to
patty
prophecy
the
clever
footman
returned
still
grave
and
immovable
of
countenance
but
bearing
a
and
a
quantity
of
pieces
of
magnificent
satin
brocades
which
had
been
cut
in
squares
that
being
the
size
indicated
by
patty
patty
took
them
with
a
gracious
air
of
satisfaction
and
rewarded
the
footman
with
thanks
in
french
and
a
smile
in
american
now
she
went
on
calmly
i
shall
be
pleased
to
have
the
assistance
of
you
two
ladies
as
i
fancy
these
young
men
are
not
any
more
accustomed
to
sewing
than
to
pulling
taffy
but
to
her
surprise
cecil
declared
himself
an
expert
needleman
and
proved
it
by
stitching
up
a
under
patty
direction
in
most
praiseworthy
fashion
each
of
the
girls
made
one
too
and
when
they
were
filled
with
the
coffee
beans
and
sewed
up
patty
was
again
overcome
by
merriment
at
the
regal
appearance
of
their
satin
brocaded
then
into
the
long
hall
they
went
but
alas
the
girls
could
not
bring
themselves
to
toss
in
an
apartment
so
filled
with
fragile
objects
of
value
in
despair
patty
again
consulted
her
friend
the
footman
as
soon
as
he
understood
her
dilemma
he
assured
her
he
would
arrange
all
and
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
he
came
back
to
her
almost
smiling
and
invited
the
party
to
follow
him
they
followed
to
the
picture
gallery
where
the
ingenious
man
had
carefully
placed
a
number
of
large
folding
japanese
screens
in
front
of
the
pictures
to
protect
them
from
possible
harm
patty
was
delighted
at
this
contrivance
and
then
followed
such
a
game
of
as
had
probably
never
been
seen
before
in
all
france
the
only
drawback
was
that
henri
could
not
take
part
in
this
sport
but
as
patty
said
wisely
one
can
not
have
everything
in
france
and
at
any
rate
he
can
eat
some
of
our
american
taffy
which
must
be
cooled
by
this
time
chapter
xix
cyclamen
perfume
it
did
seem
possible
they
had
been
at
the
chateau
for
a
week
when
the
day
came
to
go
home
it
was
lovely
at
germain
said
elise
as
they
were
once
again
settled
in
paris
but
i
glad
to
be
back
in
the
city
are
you
patty
yes
i
am
but
i
did
have
a
lovely
time
at
the
chateau
i
think
i
like
new
experiences
and
the
memory
of
them
is
like
a
lot
of
pictures
that
i
can
look
back
to
and
enjoy
whenever
i
choose
i
think
my
mind
is
getting
to
be
just
like
a
postcard
album
it
so
filled
with
views
of
foreign
places
mine
is
more
like
a
kaleidoscope
it
all
in
a
jumble
and
i
seem
to
straighten
it
out
but
after
a
day
or
two
the
girls
settled
down
into
a
fairly
steady
routine
of
home
life
they
were
both
interested
in
their
various
lessons
and
though
there
was
plenty
of
work
there
was
also
plenty
of
play
they
did
not
become
acquainted
with
many
french
people
but
the
members
of
the
american
colony
as
it
was
called
were
socially
inclined
and
they
soon
made
many
friends
then
there
was
much
shopping
to
be
done
and
farrington
seemed
quite
as
interested
in
selecting
pretty
things
for
patty
as
she
did
for
her
own
daughter
the
girls
had
especially
pretty
winter
costumes
of
dark
cloth
and
each
had
a
handsome
and
valuable
set
of
furs
in
these
with
their
paris
hats
they
looked
so
picturesque
that
farrington
proposed
they
should
have
their
photographs
taken
to
send
to
friends
at
home
the
taking
of
the
photographs
developed
into
quite
a
lengthy
performance
for
farrington
said
that
while
they
were
about
it
they
might
as
well
have
several
styles
so
it
resulted
in
their
taking
a
trunk
full
of
their
prettiest
dresses
and
hats
and
spending
a
whole
morning
in
the
photograph
gallery
it
really
more
satisfactory
observed
patty
to
do
these
things
by
the
wholesale
now
i
do
think
i
shall
have
to
have
photographs
taken
again
before
i
seventy
at
least
you
ought
to
have
them
at
fifty
replied
elise
you
be
such
a
charming
lady
patty
a
little
prim
perhaps
but
rather
nice
after
all
thanks
for
the
flattering
prospect
i
prophesy
that
when
you
fifty
you
be
a
great
artist
and
you
look
exactly
like
rosa
bonheur
and
you
wear
short
grey
hair
and
a
linen
duster
so
you
better
have
plenty
of
photographs
taken
now
for
i
do
believe
the
linen
duster
will
be
very
becoming
the
photographs
turned
out
to
be
extremely
successful
both
as
likenesses
and
as
pictures
the
girls
sent
many
copies
to
their
friends
in
america
and
nan
wrote
back
that
she
thought
the
girls
ought
to
hurry
home
or
they
would
become
incorrigible
parisiennes
both
elise
and
patty
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
hours
they
spent
in
the
great
picture
galleries
although
elise
had
herself
a
talent
for
painting
patty
had
quite
as
great
a
love
for
pictures
and
was
acquiring
a
true
appreciation
of
their
value
sometimes
elise
teacher
would
go
with
them
and
sometimes
or
farrington
but
the
girls
liked
best
to
ramble
alone
together
through
the
louvre
or
the
luxembourg
and
although
the
watchful
lisette
walked
grimly
behind
them
they
followed
their
own
sweet
will
and
often
sat
for
a
long
time
before
their
favourite
pictures
or
statues
time
has
come
the
walrus
said
said
patty
one
day
when
i
really
must
hunt
up
those
things
for
marian
she
made
a
list
of
about
fifty
things
for
me
to
take
home
to
her
and
though
they
mostly
trifles
i
expect
some
of
them
will
not
be
very
easy
to
find
suppose
we
start
out
with
that
cyclamen
perfumery
she
wanted
it
a
special
make
by
a
special
firm
but
i
suppose
we
can
find
it
so
that
afternoon
the
girls
started
on
their
cyclamen
hunt
lisette
was
to
have
accompanied
them
but
she
was
suffering
from
a
headache
and
rather
than
disappoint
the
girls
farrington
said
that
just
for
this
once
they
might
go
shopping
alone
in
the
with
the
chauffeur
in
great
glee
the
girls
started
off
and
went
first
to
several
perfumers
in
search
of
marian
order
but
cyclamen
extract
made
by
boissier
freres
was
not
to
be
found
although
many
other
french
brothers
signed
their
illustrious
names
to
cyclamen
extracts
and
although
the
boissier
freres
themselves
seemed
to
manufacture
an
essence
from
every
known
blossom
except
cyclamen
it
no
use
said
patty
to
take
any
other
kind
for
marian
simply
wo
have
it
and
she
say
that
she
should
think
i
might
have
found
it
for
her
let
go
to
the
magasins
du
louvre
they
sure
in
that
big
place
to
have
every
kind
there
is
leaving
the
at
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
great
building
the
girls
went
in
after
following
devious
directions
and
tortuous
ways
they
found
the
perfumery
counter
and
as
they
had
now
sufficient
command
of
the
french
language
to
make
their
wants
accurately
known
they
inquired
for
the
precious
cyclamen
the
affable
salesman
was
at
first
quite
sure
he
could
supply
it
but
an
exhaustive
search
failed
to
bring
forth
the
desired
kind
desolate
at
his
inability
to
please
the
young
ladies
he
informed
them
that
nowhere
could
they
find
the
object
of
their
search
unless
it
might
be
at
the
establishment
of
the
boissier
freres
themselves
which
was
across
the
seine
why
yes
cried
patty
that
just
what
marian
said
she
said
i
would
have
to
go
across
the
seine
for
it
and
i
did
know
what
she
meant
let
go
elise
when
i
start
out
to
do
a
thing
i
do
like
to
succeed
so
do
i
we
take
the
whole
afternoon
for
it
if
necessary
but
get
that
stuff
we
will
the
obliging
salesman
wrote
down
the
address
for
them
and
taking
the
paper
with
polite
thanks
the
girls
went
away
but
when
they
reached
the
street
their
motorcar
was
not
to
be
seen
in
vain
they
looked
and
waited
but
could
see
nothing
of
the
car
or
the
chauffeur
they
returned
to
the
shop
and
stood
just
inside
the
door
where
they
watched
and
waited
a
long
time
something
must
have
happened
patty
said
at
last
and
jules
has
taken
the
car
away
to
get
it
fixed
but
he
ought
to
have
let
us
know
that
he
was
going
what
shall
we
do
elise
i
do
know
what
to
do
patty
i
hate
to
waste
this
beautiful
bright
afternoon
when
we
might
be
doing
our
shopping
and
having
a
good
time
and
i
worried
about
jules
the
car
seemed
all
right
when
we
left
it
yes
nothing
ever
happens
to
that
big
car
i
think
jules
has
gone
away
on
purpose
perhaps
he
never
come
back
oh
patty
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
sure
let
telephone
home
we
can
try
it
but
i
know
the
telephone
will
be
out
of
order
it
always
is
i
never
knew
a
paris
telephone
that
was
sure
enough
when
they
tried
to
telephone
after
much
delay
and
many
unsuccessful
attempts
they
were
informed
that
there
was
some
difficulty
with
the
wires
and
that
connection
with
the
farrington
house
was
impossible
the
girls
returned
to
their
post
at
the
entrance
and
stood
looking
out
with
a
discouraged
air
still
no
car
appeared
that
they
could
recognise
as
their
own
at
last
patty
said
there
no
use
elise
in
standing
here
any
longer
jules
has
absconded
or
been
kidnapped
or
something
now
tell
you
what
we
do
let
take
a
cab
over
to
this
perfumery
place
and
back
again
and
then
if
jules
is
here
waiting
for
us
we
go
right
home
in
the
same
cab
i
know
your
mother
does
let
us
go
in
a
cab
alone
but
this
is
an
emergency
and
we
have
to
get
home
somehow
and
while
we
about
it
we
may
as
well
go
over
to
the
perfumery
place
it
is
very
far
how
do
you
know
it
is
far
because
i
know
a
lot
about
paris
now
and
i
know
the
names
of
the
streets
and
i
know
just
about
where
it
is
and
of
course
the
cabman
will
know
we
can
talk
french
to
him
and
we
can
act
very
dignified
and
anyway
we
be
back
here
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
so
come
on
elise
was
a
little
doubtful
about
the
matter
but
she
yielded
to
patty
argument
and
they
went
out
in
the
street
patty
stopped
a
passing
cab
and
giving
the
driver
the
address
the
girls
got
in
as
they
rolled
smoothly
along
patty
spirits
rose
you
see
we
did
just
the
right
thing
she
said
and
we
be
back
there
now
before
jules
is
on
they
went
across
the
seine
and
into
a
strange
district
unlike
any
they
had
ever
seen
before
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
to
the
address
written
on
the
paper
the
girls
went
into
the
shop
and
found
to
their
dismay
that
the
perfumery
company
was
there
no
longer
but
had
moved
some
time
since
to
another
address
with
great
dignity
and
fairly
good
french
patty
inquired
the
present
address
of
the
firm
and
receiving
it
returned
to
the
cab
i
determined
she
said
to
elise
to
go
on
with
this
thing
now
that
i
begun
it
i
going
to
find
that
cyclamen
just
because
made
up
my
mind
to
do
so
the
cabman
seemed
to
know
the
address
indicated
and
started
his
horse
off
at
a
jog
trot
on
they
went
farther
and
farther
and
getting
into
a
more
and
more
disagreeable
district
the
streets
grew
narrower
the
houses
shabbier
and
the
people
along
the
streets
were
noisy
and
boisterous
patty
did
not
like
to
admit
it
but
she
began
to
wish
she
had
not
come
and
elise
was
plainly
frightened
for
the
people
along
the
street
stared
at
the
pretty
american
girls
driving
about
alone
in
a
public
conveyance
at
last
patty
said
in
a
low
voice
it
horrid
elise
and
i
truly
sorry
i
insisted
on
coming
shall
we
ask
the
man
to
go
back
yes
said
elise
that
is
if
you
think
best
but
i
hate
to
go
any
farther
in
this
horrid
quarter
so
patty
explained
to
the
driver
that
they
had
concluded
not
to
go
to
the
perfumer
that
day
and
directed
him
to
take
them
back
to
the
magasins
du
louvre
but
the
cabman
objected
to
this
proposition
and
said
they
were
now
not
far
from
the
place
they
were
in
search
of
and
he
would
go
on
till
they
reached
it
patty
expostulated
but
the
cabman
was
firm
in
his
decision
he
was
not
impertinent
but
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
young
ladies
were
too
easily
discouraged
and
assured
them
they
would
soon
reach
their
destination
so
they
went
on
and
patty
and
elise
grew
more
and
more
alarmed
as
their
situation
became
more
unpleasant
it
was
certainly
no
place
for
them
to
be
unattended
and
the
fact
that
they
could
not
persuade
the
cabman
to
go
back
dismayed
them
both
but
patty
pluck
stood
by
her
grasping
elise
hand
firmly
she
whispered
do
you
collapse
elise
if
you
cry
i
never
forgive
you
brace
up
now
and
help
me
through
it
will
be
all
right
if
we
act
afraid
how
can
i
help
acting
afraid
said
poor
elise
her
teeth
chattering
when
i
to
death
do
be
scared
to
death
i
tell
you
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
brace
up
i
say
patty
gave
elise
arm
such
a
pinch
as
to
make
her
jump
and
just
then
the
cab
stopped
at
the
establishment
of
boissier
freres
it
proved
to
be
the
right
place
this
time
and
the
girls
went
in
behind
the
counter
stood
a
dapper
young
man
who
waited
on
them
obsequiously
but
when
he
heard
patty
request
he
said
they
did
not
have
that
essence
in
their
regular
stock
and
only
made
it
when
ordered
then
said
patty
at
the
end
of
her
patience
i
order
some
will
you
make
it
for
me
please
for
that
said
the
young
man
i
must
refer
you
to
another
department
you
have
to
go
to
see
poirier
who
takes
such
orders
and
where
shall
i
find
him
asked
patty
the
obliging
young
man
began
to
write
down
an
address
it
is
some
distance
away
he
said
and
not
a
very
accessible
place
to
get
to
patty
looked
at
elise
and
laughed
i
give
it
up
she
said
i
thought
i
could
do
marian
errand
but
it
proving
too
much
for
me
she
thanked
the
young
man
for
the
address
and
put
it
away
in
her
purse
with
but
slight
intention
of
ever
using
it
she
bought
a
bottle
of
another
sort
of
perfumery
and
saying
good
afternoon
left
the
shop
but
when
she
and
elise
regained
the
sidewalk
there
was
no
cab
in
sight
they
looked
in
every
direction
but
could
see
nothing
of
it
he
ca
have
gone
away
said
patty
for
i
have
paid
him
but
he
has
gone
away
said
elise
and
oh
patty
i
just
remember
i
left
my
purse
on
the
seat
was
there
much
in
it
yes
a
good
deal
i
have
done
any
shopping
yet
you
know
well
that
explains
it
he
gone
off
with
your
purse
for
he
knew
that
very
likely
we
did
have
his
number
and
of
course
we
can
never
find
him
again
elise
do
you
dare
to
cry
we
in
an
awful
scrape
now
but
we
get
out
of
it
somehow
if
you
only
be
plucky
about
it
do
you
fail
me
and
i
get
out
of
it
somehow
patty
admonitions
were
none
too
soon
for
elise
was
on
the
very
verge
of
bursting
into
tears
but
when
patty
appealed
to
her
for
aid
she
tried
hard
to
overcome
her
fears
and
be
a
help
instead
of
a
hindrance
patty
considered
the
situation
i
hate
to
go
back
into
that
shop
and
ask
that
young
man
to
call
me
a
cab
she
said
for
he
was
so
fawning
and
officious
that
i
did
like
his
manner
a
bit
but
there
seem
to
be
anything
else
to
do
for
there
no
policeman
in
sight
and
of
course
no
telephone
station
and
of
course
it
would
work
if
there
was
one
and
there
no
other
place
about
here
that
looks
as
if
i
dare
go
in
and
so
we
must
go
back
and
ask
that
horrid
man
now
brace
up
elise
put
on
your
most
haughty
air
and
look
as
dignified
as
a
duchess
illustration
with
caption
just
remember
i
left
my
purse
on
the
seat
chapter
xx
the
bazaar
elise
tried
hard
to
follow
patty
directions
but
she
did
not
represent
a
very
haughty
type
of
duchess
as
she
tremblingly
followed
patty
into
the
shop
but
patty
herself
held
her
head
high
and
assumed
the
dignity
of
a
whole
line
of
duchesses
as
she
stalked
toward
the
counter
she
chose
her
french
with
much
care
and
in
exceedingly
formal
diction
informed
the
young
man
that
she
desired
to
call
a
cab
without
expressing
astonishment
at
this
the
young
man
politely
assured
her
that
he
would
call
a
cab
for
her
at
once
that
it
would
take
some
time
to
procure
one
as
there
were
none
save
at
a
considerable
distance
there
being
nothing
else
to
do
poor
patty
expressed
herself
as
willing
to
wait
but
coldly
desired
that
all
possible
haste
be
made
the
fifteen
minutes
that
the
girls
waited
was
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
quarter
of
an
hour
they
had
ever
spent
in
their
lives
and
indeed
it
seemed
more
like
fifteen
hours
than
fifteen
minutes
they
scarcely
spoke
to
one
another
patty
feeling
the
responsibility
of
the
whole
affair
was
thinking
what
she
should
do
in
case
a
cab
come
while
elise
was
entirely
absorbed
in
her
earnest
endeavours
not
to
cry
but
at
last
a
cab
appeared
and
the
two
girls
got
in
patty
gave
the
order
to
drive
back
to
the
great
shop
from
which
they
had
started
on
their
adventure
it
seemed
an
interminable
distance
through
the
unpleasant
streets
but
when
at
last
they
reached
the
magasins
du
louvre
and
drew
up
to
the
entrance
elise
gave
a
delighted
cry
and
said
oh
there
our
car
and
jules
in
it
the
car
was
across
the
street
and
the
chauffeur
sat
with
his
arms
folded
in
an
attitude
of
patient
waiting
the
girls
got
out
of
the
cab
patty
paid
the
cabman
and
as
they
beckoned
to
jules
he
started
the
car
across
the
street
toward
them
where
have
you
been
inquired
elise
in
a
reproving
tone
but
the
chauffeur
declared
that
he
had
sat
the
whole
afternoon
in
that
one
spot
waiting
for
the
young
ladies
when
elise
said
that
they
had
come
to
the
door
and
looked
for
him
in
vain
he
only
asseverated
that
he
had
not
moved
from
the
spot
opposite
the
entrance
but
had
been
there
all
the
time
watching
the
door
for
their
reappearance
as
she
had
never
known
jules
to
be
untruthful
elise
was
bewildered
at
this
statement
but
presently
a
light
dawned
on
patty
i
see
elise
she
cried
it
the
other
entrance
the
doors
are
almost
exactly
the
same
this
is
the
one
where
we
went
in
but
we
came
out
at
the
door
on
the
other
street
and
we
were
such
idiots
we
know
the
difference
and
we
flattered
ourselves
that
we
knew
paris
exclaimed
elise
well
patty
let
go
home
we
not
fit
to
be
trusted
out
alone
so
home
the
girls
went
feeling
decidedly
that
they
were
so
well
out
of
their
scrape
patty
went
at
once
to
farrington
and
gave
her
an
exact
narrative
of
the
whole
affair
she
took
all
the
blame
on
herself
and
it
was
rightfully
hers
saying
that
she
had
persuaded
elise
against
her
will
to
go
in
the
cab
across
the
seine
to
the
perfumer
farrington
laughed
at
patty
extremely
penitential
air
and
said
my
dear
child
do
take
it
quite
so
seriously
you
not
to
blame
for
mistaking
the
doors
that
big
shop
is
very
confusing
and
after
waiting
for
jules
and
telephoning
and
all
that
you
did
quite
right
to
take
a
cab
as
it
was
really
an
emergency
but
you
did
not
do
right
to
go
exploring
an
unfamiliar
quarter
of
paris
on
an
uncertain
errand
however
you
certainly
had
punishment
enough
in
your
bewilderment
and
anxiety
and
i
think
you
have
learned
your
lesson
and
nothing
more
need
be
said
about
it
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
by
way
of
reprimand
but
many
times
patty
was
joked
by
the
farrington
family
and
often
when
she
started
out
anywhere
was
advised
not
to
try
to
buy
cyclamen
perfumery
toward
the
end
of
january
the
van
ness
girls
came
to
call
they
had
returned
to
paris
as
they
expected
and
were
truly
glad
to
see
patty
and
elise
again
we
had
a
lovely
trip
doris
declared
but
we
awfully
glad
to
get
back
to
paris
and
oh
girls
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
plan
in
which
we
awfully
interested
there
a
poor
girl
an
american
and
her
name
is
leila
hunt
let
me
tell
broke
in
alicia
she
an
art
student
and
she
trying
to
support
herself
in
paris
while
she
studies
and
the
other
day
we
were
walking
through
the
louvre
and
we
saw
her
there
copying
a
picture
chimed
in
doris
yes
copying
a
picture
went
on
alicia
and
she
was
so
faint
because
she
does
have
enough
to
eat
you
know
that
she
fell
off
the
stool
and
fainted
away
from
sheer
exhaustion
how
dreadful
cried
patty
ca
we
help
her
that
just
it
said
doris
we
want
to
help
her
and
we
getting
up
a
bazaar
for
her
benefit
but
she
must
know
it
for
she
awfully
proud
and
would
like
it
a
bit
you
know
her
personally
then
asked
elise
yes
we
hunted
up
her
address
and
went
to
see
her
and
the
poor
thing
is
so
weak
and
thin
but
awfully
brave
and
plucky
and
papa
says
give
some
money
and
i
thought
perhaps
farrington
would
too
and
then
we
thought
it
might
help
to
have
a
bazaar
and
make
some
money
that
way
and
then
we
send
it
to
her
anonymously
for
i
do
believe
she
take
it
any
other
way
rosamond
barstow
was
present
at
this
conversation
and
she
said
i
think
it
a
lovely
plan
and
i
be
glad
to
help
where
are
you
going
to
hold
the
bazaar
that
the
trouble
said
alicia
we
do
know
any
place
that
just
right
you
see
we
at
a
hotel
and
a
bazaar
in
a
hotel
is
so
public
i
suppose
there
is
room
in
this
house
no
said
elise
there
are
plenty
of
rooms
but
no
one
is
big
enough
for
an
affair
of
that
kind
but
we
have
one
exclaimed
rosamond
eagerly
our
house
has
an
immense
ballroom
we
almost
never
use
it
but
it
would
be
just
the
place
for
a
bazaar
would
your
people
like
to
have
us
use
it
oh
yes
mother
lets
me
do
anything
i
like
and
anyway
she
be
awfully
glad
to
help
an
american
girl
you
said
an
american
girl
did
you
yes
miss
hunt
is
from
new
england
oh
it
will
be
lovely
if
we
can
have
the
bazaar
in
your
house
and
all
the
american
colony
will
come
and
we
make
a
lot
of
money
the
plan
was
laid
before
farrington
who
entirely
approved
of
it
and
then
the
five
girls
went
over
to
rosamond
to
ask
consent
and
to
look
at
the
ballroom
barstow
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
idea
and
consented
at
once
that
the
bazaar
should
be
held
in
the
ballroom
and
she
went
with
the
girls
to
look
at
the
big
apartment
and
to
make
plans
as
the
van
ness
party
were
only
to
remain
in
paris
a
week
it
was
necessary
that
the
affair
should
be
arranged
speedily
and
the
plan
quickly
carried
out
van
ness
farrington
and
barstow
were
to
be
patronesses
but
the
girls
the
two
van
ness
boys
and
martin
barstow
were
to
do
the
actual
work
and
make
all
arrangements
it
was
a
somewhat
original
scheme
of
entertainment
and
as
alicia
described
it
the
rest
all
agreed
that
it
would
be
great
fun
it
was
to
last
only
one
afternoon
from
three
to
six
and
it
was
called
the
bazaar
of
arts
and
manufactures
the
girls
called
upon
many
members
of
the
american
colony
and
asked
them
to
donate
material
of
any
kind
such
as
silks
satins
ribbons
fancy
paper
materials
or
fabrics
of
any
sort
they
responded
generously
and
also
gave
many
articles
to
be
sold
at
the
bazaar
and
promised
to
send
contributions
for
the
refreshment
room
the
boys
declared
that
their
part
was
the
decoration
of
the
ballroom
and
they
not
only
ornamented
the
room
but
built
various
little
booths
and
arranged
such
counters
and
tables
as
were
needed
when
the
day
of
the
bazaar
came
nobody
knew
quite
what
the
entertainment
was
to
be
but
were
prepared
for
an
original
amusement
of
some
kind
after
a
large
crowd
of
people
had
assembled
guy
van
ness
mounted
a
platform
and
announced
that
there
would
now
be
held
a
contest
of
arts
and
manufactures
everybody
present
on
the
payment
of
a
certain
sum
would
be
allowed
to
compete
and
prizes
were
offered
to
the
successful
competitors
in
each
department
then
greatly
to
the
amusement
of
the
audience
he
announced
that
the
various
achievements
arranged
for
were
such
easily
accomplished
feats
as
the
trimming
of
hats
the
painting
of
pictures
modelling
in
clay
making
paper
flowers
and
various
other
arts
and
handicrafts
among
which
each
might
select
a
preference
after
every
competitor
had
qualified
and
was
fully
prepared
to
begin
a
gong
would
be
sounded
exactly
at
the
end
of
a
half
hour
another
gong
would
sound
when
every
one
must
cease
at
once
whether
the
work
was
finished
or
not
as
soon
as
the
guests
thoroughly
understood
what
they
were
to
do
great
interest
was
displayed
and
competitors
were
rapidly
entered
for
the
different
contests
those
who
were
artists
took
their
places
at
a
table
provided
with
water
colors
oil
paints
pastels
and
drawing
materials
the
clay
modellers
were
at
another
table
with
ample
provision
for
their
art
many
ladies
who
declared
they
had
no
talents
prepared
to
trim
hats
all
sorts
of
material
such
as
velvet
lace
flowers
feathers
and
ribbons
were
provided
as
well
as
the
untrimmed
shapes
in
another
booth
ladies
prepared
to
make
japanese
kimonos
or
and
in
another
booth
were
materials
for
paper
flowers
there
was
a
outfit
and
sets
of
woodcarvers
tools
and
robert
van
ness
declared
that
he
knew
he
could
take
the
prize
for
whittling
another
booth
held
crepe
paper
for
lampshades
or
other
fancy
work
and
it
was
not
long
before
every
one
had
selected
an
occupation
and
was
prepared
to
begin
work
elise
of
course
was
going
to
draw
a
picture
and
patty
concluded
she
would
trim
a
hat
as
it
neared
the
time
patty
threaded
her
needle
and
put
on
her
thimble
but
was
not
allowed
to
touch
her
material
until
the
signal
was
given
henri
labesse
was
at
the
bazaar
and
though
his
arm
was
still
a
little
stiff
he
entered
the
competition
and
was
to
model
a
figure
of
clay
the
gong
struck
and
everybody
flew
madly
at
their
work
anxious
to
complete
it
within
the
half
hour
elise
who
was
methodical
began
her
drawing
as
slowly
and
carefully
as
if
she
had
the
whole
day
for
it
reasoning
to
herself
that
she
would
rather
hurry
the
finishing
than
the
beginning
patty
on
the
other
hand
dashed
impatiently
at
her
pinning
things
on
here
and
there
thinking
she
would
sew
them
if
she
had
time
and
if
not
they
could
stay
pinned
both
the
van
ness
girls
were
making
paper
and
rosamond
was
already
well
along
on
a
picturesque
japanese
kimono
she
sewed
up
the
breadths
like
a
and
whipped
on
the
bordering
rapidly
but
with
strong
firm
stitches
she
would
easily
have
taken
the
prize
in
her
department
but
the
girls
had
agreed
among
themselves
that
they
would
accept
no
prizes
even
if
they
won
them
when
the
gong
struck
at
the
close
of
the
half
hour
some
of
the
work
was
still
unfinished
but
most
of
the
articles
were
completed
and
it
was
indeed
marvellous
to
see
what
could
be
done
by
people
working
at
their
utmost
speed
elise
picture
was
charming
and
patty
hat
was
among
the
prettiest
competent
judges
awarded
the
prizes
and
then
the
articles
whether
finished
or
unfinished
were
sold
at
auction
and
they
brought
large
prices
for
many
of
them
were
well
worth
having
and
too
the
buyers
were
quite
ready
to
give
liberally
in
aid
of
the
worthy
charity
henri
labesse
had
made
a
clay
model
of
an
american
girl
which
was
a
gem
in
its
characteristic
effect
and
its
skilful
workmanship
it
was
not
quite
finished
but
of
course
was
offered
at
auction
along
with
the
other
things
there
was
lively
bidding
for
the
little
figure
as
everybody
seemed
to
recognise
its
artistic
value
but
after
being
bidden
up
to
a
high
price
it
was
finally
sold
to
a
young
man
who
it
turned
out
was
merely
acting
as
an
agent
for
henri
labesse
himself
he
had
instructed
this
young
man
to
buy
the
figure
in
at
any
price
with
a
result
that
a
goodly
sum
went
into
the
charitable
treasury
after
receiving
his
own
work
back
again
labesse
took
it
across
to
where
patty
sat
and
begged
her
acceptance
of
it
adding
that
he
would
take
it
home
and
complete
it
before
sending
it
to
her
patty
was
delighted
to
have
the
little
statuette
as
a
souvenir
of
the
occasion
and
also
as
a
memento
of
labesse
whom
she
thoroughly
liked
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
serving
ices
and
cakes
and
fruit
to
the
patrons
of
the
bazaar
and
after
it
was
all
over
the
girls
were
delighted
to
find
that
they
had
realised
about
twice
as
much
money
as
they
had
hoped
for
alicia
van
ness
was
ecstatic
and
declared
it
would
make
miss
hunt
independent
and
free
of
all
financial
worry
during
the
rest
of
her
term
in
the
art
school
and
as
it
was
to
be
sent
to
her
without
a
hint
as
to
its
source
she
could
not
refuse
to
accept
it
i
do
think
it
was
lovely
of
those
van
ness
girls
said
patty
as
they
discussed
the
bazaar
at
to
do
all
that
for
a
perfect
stranger
i
do
too
said
elise
they
awfully
girls
when
i
first
met
them
i
did
like
them
much
they
were
so
unconventional
in
their
manners
but
travelling
about
has
improved
them
and
they
certainly
are
generous
and
yes
they
are
said
patty
and
i
like
them
anyway
i
sorry
they
are
going
away
from
paris
so
soon
well
i
glad
we
not
going
away
said
elise
at
any
rate
not
just
yet
how
much
longer
do
you
suppose
we
shall
stay
here
mother
i
do
know
my
child
but
i
getting
about
ready
to
go
home
what
do
you
think
patty
since
you
ask
me
i
must
confess
i
should
like
to
stay
a
while
longer
but
if
you
going
home
farrington
i
feel
pretty
sure
we
shall
all
travel
on
the
same
boat
chapter
xxi
a
surprise
but
nothing
more
was
said
about
going
home
and
the
weeks
slipped
by
until
it
was
march
everything
seemed
to
be
winding
itself
up
patty
music
term
was
finished
elise
drawing
lessons
were
nearing
their
close
for
the
season
and
farrington
though
she
said
nothing
about
going
home
somehow
seemed
to
be
quietly
getting
ready
patty
did
exactly
understand
the
attitude
of
her
hostess
if
she
were
going
home
soon
patty
wanted
to
know
it
and
one
day
she
laughingly
said
so
i
suppose
said
farrington
looking
at
her
quizzically
not
unnatural
that
you
should
want
to
know
when
you
going
to
see
your
native
land
again
but
truly
patty
i
can
not
tell
you
promise
you
this
though
you
know
more
about
it
than
you
do
patty
was
mystified
at
this
for
farrington
tone
was
even
more
enigmatical
than
her
words
and
wait
a
minute
girls
said
farrington
as
they
were
about
to
go
to
their
rooms
to
dress
for
dinner
put
on
your
pretty
new
dresses
will
you
why
mother
said
elise
in
astonishment
those
are
company
gowns
and
there
no
company
here
no
there
no
company
here
but
put
them
on
as
i
tell
you
i
want
to
see
how
they
look
i
do
see
what
the
matter
with
mother
said
elise
as
they
went
upstairs
she
been
restless
and
fidgety
all
day
and
now
the
idea
of
telling
us
to
put
on
those
new
frocks
i
just
as
lieve
do
it
said
patty
they
awfully
pretty
ones
and
i
want
to
see
how
they
look
myself
when
the
girls
went
downstairs
they
found
farrington
already
in
the
she
herself
wore
a
more
elaborate
toilette
than
usual
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
extra
abundance
of
flowers
and
lights
what
is
the
matter
said
elise
there
something
about
the
atmosphere
of
this
house
that
betokens
a
party
but
i
do
see
any
party
is
there
any
party
mother
i
do
see
any
my
child
said
farrington
smiling
where
father
asked
elise
he
out
said
her
mother
we
waiting
for
dinner
until
he
comes
just
then
a
ring
was
heard
at
the
front
there
your
father
now
said
farrington
abruptly
patty
my
dear
wo
you
run
up
to
my
bedroom
and
get
me
my
vinaigrette
why
you
have
it
on
farrington
said
patty
in
surprise
hanging
from
your
chatelaine
oh
yes
of
course
so
it
is
but
i
mean
my
other
one
my
gold
one
oh
no
i
do
want
two
vinaigrettes
do
i
i
mean
wo
you
run
up
and
get
me
a
handkerchief
why
mother
exclaimed
elise
in
surprise
ring
for
lisette
or
at
least
let
me
go
do
send
patty
no
i
want
patty
to
go
said
farrington
decidedly
please
go
my
child
and
get
me
a
handkerchief
from
the
drawer
in
my
get
the
one
that
is
fourth
from
the
top
in
the
second
pile
certainly
said
patty
and
she
ran
upstairs
wondering
what
whim
possessed
her
hostess
to
send
her
guest
though
ever
so
willing
on
her
errand
patty
had
some
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
right
handkerchief
in
spite
of
the
explicit
directions
and
when
she
again
reached
the
drawingroom
farrington
was
there
and
both
he
and
his
wife
were
smiling
broadly
elise
too
seemed
overcome
with
merriment
and
patty
paused
in
the
doorway
saying
what
is
the
matter
with
you
people
please
let
me
into
the
joke
too
do
you
want
to
know
what
is
the
matter
asked
farrington
as
she
took
the
handkerchief
from
patty
hand
well
go
and
look
behind
those
curtains
and
see
what
in
the
alcove
i
suppose
said
patty
as
she
deliberately
walked
the
length
of
the
long
you
been
buying
the
venus
of
milo
and
it
just
been
sent
home
and
you
set
it
up
here
behind
these
curtains
well
i
shall
be
pleased
to
admire
it
i
sure
she
drew
the
crimson
curtains
apart
and
right
before
her
instead
of
a
marble
statue
stood
her
father
and
nan
then
such
an
exciting
time
as
there
was
patty
threw
her
arms
around
them
both
at
once
and
everybody
was
laughing
and
they
all
talked
at
the
same
time
and
patty
understood
at
last
why
they
had
been
directed
to
put
on
their
new
dresses
can
it
be
possible
that
this
is
my
little
girl
exclaimed
fairfield
as
he
drew
patty
down
up
on
his
knee
quite
as
he
used
to
when
she
was
really
a
little
girl
nonsense
cried
nan
you
have
changed
a
bit
patty
except
to
grow
about
half
an
inch
taller
and
to
be
wearing
a
remarkably
pretty
dress
and
you
people
have
changed
a
bit
either
declared
patty
and
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
she
flew
back
and
forth
from
one
of
her
parents
to
the
other
pinching
them
to
make
sure
as
she
said
that
they
were
really
there
and
now
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
looking
at
the
others
did
you
all
know
they
were
coming
no
said
farrington
farrington
and
i
have
known
it
for
some
weeks
but
we
did
dare
tell
elise
for
she
such
a
chatterbox
she
never
could
have
kept
the
secret
and
we
wanted
so
much
to
surprise
you
well
you
have
surprised
me
said
patty
and
it
the
loveliest
surprise
i
ever
had
oh
what
fun
it
will
be
to
take
you
benighted
people
around
to
see
paris
so
elise
declared
it
was
a
party
after
all
and
the
dinner
was
a
very
merry
one
and
the
whole
evening
was
spent
in
gay
chatter
about
the
winter
just
past
and
making
plans
for
the
summer
to
come
patty
did
gather
very
definitely
what
these
plans
were
but
she
soon
learned
that
and
fairfield
had
come
to
paris
really
to
get
her
and
then
they
were
going
on
to
london
and
where
else
patty
neither
knew
nor
cared
the
farringtons
were
to
return
soon
to
america
and
so
the
whole
change
of
outlook
was
so
sudden
that
patty
was
bewildered
you
look
as
if
you
did
quite
know
yet
what
has
happened
said
fairfield
to
patty
as
the
whole
party
stood
in
the
hall
saying
their
i
do
papa
said
patty
but
i
very
happy
i
had
a
delightful
winter
and
and
farrington
have
been
most
beautifully
kind
and
elise
is
just
the
dearest
chum
in
the
world
but
you
know
papa
home
is
where
the
heart
is
and
my
heart
belongs
just
to
you
and
nan
and
so
now
i
feel
that
i
am
home
again
at
last
and
we
mighty
glad
to
have
you
little
girl
again
in
our
heart
and
home
it
was
pretty
lonesome
without
you
all
winter
in
new
york
but
now
we
all
three
together
again
and
we
help
each
other
enjoy
the
good
time
that
coming
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
said
patty
as
she
kissed
her
parents
and
ran
away
to
all
sorts
of
happy
dreams
