introduction
let
me
introduce
a
race
void
of
beauty
and
of
grace
extraordinary
creatures
with
a
paucity
of
features
though
their
forms
are
fashioned
ill
they
have
manners
stranger
still
for
in
rudeness
they
precocious
they
atrocious
they
ferocious
yet
you
learn
if
you
are
bright
politeness
from
the
impolite
when
you
finished
with
the
book
at
your
conduct
take
a
look
ask
yourself
upon
the
spot
you
goop
or
are
you
not
for
although
it
fun
to
see
them
it
is
terrible
to
be
them

the
goops
they
lick
their
fingers
and
the
goops
they
lick
their
knives
they
spill
their
broth
on
the
tablecloth
oh
they
lead
disgusting
lives
the
goops
they
talk
while
eating
and
loud
and
fast
they
chew
and
that
is
why
i
glad
that
i
am
not
a

the
goops
are
gluttonous
and
rude
they
gug
and
gumble
with
their
food
they
throw
their
crumbs
upon
the
floor
and
at
dessert
they
tease
for
more
they
will
not
eat
their
soup
and
bread
but
like
to
gobble
sweets
instead
and
this
is
why
i
oft
decline
when
i
am
asked
to
stay
and
dine

cleanliness
top
the
goops
they
are
spotted
on
chin
and
on
cheek
you
could
dig
the
dirt
off
with
a
trowel
but
wash
your
face
twenty
times
every
week
and
you
do
do
it
with
the
towel
the
goops
are
all
dirty
and
what
do
they
do
they
like
to
be
dirty
and
stay
so
but
if
were
dirty
you
wash
would
you
if
you
needed
a

you
would
say
so

it
is
polite
in
shaking
hands
to
give
your

wonder
why
it
is
refined
in
passing
one
to
go
i
wonder
why
it
is
if
you
must
sneeze
to
turn
your
head
perhaps
the
reason
is
because
the
goops
they
never
have
such
laws

generosity
when
you
have
candy
do
you
go
and
give
your
sister

when
little
brother
stubs
his

you
look
on
and
laugh
the
greediest
goop

things
he

which
you
play

memory
my
teacher
taught
me
yesterday
a
very
pretty
piece
to
say
but
when
i
try
to
think
of
it
i
ca
remember
it
a
bit
my
head
so
full
of
toys
and
such
i
ca
remember
very
much
my
teacher
told
me
yesterday
when
you
work
play
when
you
play
when
i
am
playing
with
my
toys
i
am
the
busiest
of
boys
but
when
i
study
or
i
work
i
i
inclined
to
shirk
illustration
illustration
books
i
have
a
notion
the
books
on
the
shelves
are
just
as
much
persons
as
we
are
ourselves
when
you
are
older
you
find
this
is
true
you
better
be
careful
to
make
books
like
you

honesty
the
boy
who
plays
at
marbles
and
does
try
to
cheat
who
always
keeps
his
temper
no
matter
if
he
beat
is
sure
to
be
a
favorite
with
all
upon
the
street
the
girl
who
counts
her
hundreds
very
fairly
when
she
it
who
does
peep
or
listen
nor
turn
around
a
bit
i
sure
she
not
a
goop
in

she
quite
the
opposite

why
josephus
never
yet
was
heard
to
say
but
just
one
single
word
when
father
said
to
go
to
bed
then
was
all
josephus
said
when
mother
bade
him
stop
his
play
then
josephus
used
to
say
he
always
made
the

reply
was
never
anything

the
night
is
different
from
the
day
it
darker
in
the
night
how
can
you
ever
hope
to
play
when
it
no
longer
light
when
comes
it
time
for
you
to
stop

modesty
the
proper
time
for
you
to
show
whatever
little
tricks
you
know
is
when
grown
people
ask
you
to
you
may
show
what
you
can
do
but
sometimes
mother
head
will
ache
with
all
the
jolly
noise
you
make
and
sometimes
other
people
too
ca
spend
the
time
to
play
with
you
illustration

disfiguration
have
you
ever
seen
the
scrawls
on
the
fences
and
the
walls
all
the
horrid
little
pictures
and
the
horrid
little
names
do
you
think
it
is
a
shame
are
the
goops
the
ones
to
blame
did
you
ever
catch
them
playing
at
their
horrid
little
games
illustration
illustration
bravery
it
terrible
brave
to
try
to
save
a
girl
on
a
runaway
horse
you
could
do
that
of
course
but
think
of
trying
to
keep
from
crying
when
you
hungry
and
tired
and
cross
you
could
do
of
course
illustration

tidiness
little
scraps
of
paper
little
crumbs
of
food
make
a
room
untidy
everywhere
they
strewed
do
you
sharpen
pencils
ever
on
the
floor
what
becomes
of
and
your
can
you
blame
your
mother
if
she
looks
severe
when
she
says
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
goops
were
here
illustration

taken
more
than
was
your
share
when
you
been
sulky
cross
or
wild
you
must
not
say
oh
i
do
care
but
when
you
hate
to
see
it
rain
and
when
it
time
to
comb
your
hair
and
when
you
have
a

politeness
i
think
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
to
be
polite
to
every
one
a
boy
would
doff
his
little
hat
a
girl
would
curtsey
just
like
that
and
both
would
use
such
words
as
these
me
and
you
not
only
just
at
home
you
know
but
everywhere
that
they
should
go

gentleness
when
you
are
playing
with
the
girls
you

you
will
be
glad
of
it
some
day

hospitality
when

the
best
make
him
very
comfortable
and
show
him
all
your
toys
and
only
play
the
games
you
very
sure
that
he
enjoys
when
you
pay
a
visit
never
grumble
or
complain
try
to
be
so
affable
they
want
you
there
again
do
forget
the

your
