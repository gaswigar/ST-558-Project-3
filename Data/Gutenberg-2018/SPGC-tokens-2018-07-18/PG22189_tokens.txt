parables
of
the
cross
by
lilias
trotter
to
in
memory
of
lessons
learnt
together
marshall
brothers
london
edinburgh
death
is
the
gate
of
life
there
was
deep
insight
in
those
old
words
for
man
natural
thought
of
death
is
that
of
a
dreary
ending
in
decay
and
dissolution
and
from
his
standpoint
he
is
right
death
as
the
punishment
of
sin
is
an
ending
but
far
other
is
god
thought
in
the
redemption
of
the
world
he
takes
the
very
thing
that
came
in
with
the
curse
and
makes
it
the
path
of
glory
death
becomes
a
beginning
instead
of
an
ending
for
it
becomes
the
means
of
liberating
a
fresh
life
and
so
the
hope
that
lies
in
these
parable
lessons
of
death
and
life
is
meant
for
those
only
who
are
turning
to
him
for
redemption
to
those
who
have
not
turned
death
stands
in
all
its
old
awful
doom
inevitable
irrevocable
there
is
no
gleam
of
light
through
it
for
them
the
death
of
the
cross
death
triumph
hour
that
was
the
point
where
god
gate
opened
and
to
that
gate
we
come
again
and
again
as
our
lives
unfold
and
through
it
pass
even
on
earth
to
our
joyful
resurrection
to
a
life
each
time
more
abundant
for
each
time
the
dying
is
a
deeper
dying
the
christian
life
is
a
process
of
deliverance
out
of
one
world
into
another
and
death
as
has
been
truly
said
is
the
only
way
out
of
any
world
in
which
we
are
death
is
the
gate
of
life
does
it
look
so
to
us
have
we
learnt
to
go
down
once
and
again
into
its
gathering
shadows
in
quietness
and
confidence
knowing
that
there
is
always
a
better
resurrection
beyond
it
is
in
the
stages
of
a
plant
growth
its
budding
and
blossoming
and
that
this
lesson
has
come
to
me
the
lesson
of
death
in
its
delivering
power
it
has
come
as
no
mere
imagery
but
as
one
of
the
many
voices
in
which
god
speaks
bringing
strength
and
gladness
from
his
holy
place
can
we
not
trace
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
the
first
hint
of
the
new
spring
dawning
in
many
cases
as
in
the
chestnut
before
a
single
old
leaf
has
faded
next
year
buds
may
be
seen
at
the
summit
of
branch
and
twig
formed
into
its
very
likeness
in
others
the
seem
to
bear
its
mark
by
breaking
through
the
stem
back
in
the
plant
first
stages
the
crimson
touch
is
to
be
found
in
and
fresh
shoots
and
even
in
the
hidden
sprouts
look
at
the
acorn
for
instance
as
it
breaks
its
shell
and
see
how
the
baby
tree
bears
its
birthmark
it
is
the
in
which
the
prism
ray
dawns
out
of
the
darkness
and
the
sunrise
out
of
the
night
the
very
stars
science
now
tells
us
glow
with
this
same
colour
as
they
are
born
into
the
universe
out
of
the
dying
of
former
prof
huggins
brit
asso
be
it
as
it
may
in
nature
it
is
true
at
any
rate
in
the
world
of
grace
that
each
soul
that
would
enter
into
real
life
must
bear
at
the
outset
this
crimson
seal
there
must
be
the
individual
sprinkling
of
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
it
must
go
out
through
the
gate
of
the
cross
and
here
is
the
death
is
the
only
way
out
of
the
world
of
condemnation
wherein
we
lie
shut
into
that
world
it
is
vain
to
try
by
any
to
battle
out
nothing
can
revoke
the
decree
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
the
only
choice
left
is
this
shall
it
be
under
the
old
headship
of
adam
our
own
death
in
all
that
god
means
by
the
word
or
shall
it
be
under
the
headship
of
christ
the
death
of
another
in
our
place
it
is
when
we
come
to
when
we
feel
ourselves
locked
in
waiting
our
doom
that
the
glory
and
the
beauty
of
god
way
of
escape
dawns
upon
us
and
we
submit
ourselves
to
him
in
it
all
resistance
breaks
down
as
faith
closes
on
the
fact
he
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
we
receive
the
atonement
so
hardly
won
and
we
go
out
into
life
not
only
pardoned
but
cleared
and
justified
death
to
sin
penalty
is
the
way
out
into
a
life
of
justification
and
as
we
go
out
free
we
find
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
cross
a
new
existence
has
really
begun
that
the
love
of
the
crucified
has
touched
the
springs
of
our
being
we
are
in
another
world
under
an
open
heaven
christ
hath
suffered
for
sins
the
just
for
the
unjust
that
he
might
bring
us
to
god
does
anyone
read
these
words
who
is
trying
to
struggle
from
the
natural
life
into
the
spiritual
by
some
other
way
than
this
way
of
the
cross
it
is
as
impossible
as
it
would
be
to
pass
from
into
except
through
the
night
your
battling
is
a
battling
against
god
yield
and
come
to
his
terms
yield
now
but
blessed
as
it
is
this
passage
into
a
life
of
peace
with
him
woe
to
the
soul
that
stops
there
thinking
that
the
goal
is
reached
and
dwindles
so
to
speak
into
a
stunted
bud
holiness
not
safety
is
the
end
of
our
calling
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
a
fresh
need
for
deliverance
is
soon
pressed
upon
him
who
is
true
to
god
voice
in
his
heart
the
two
lives
are
there
together
one
and
feeble
the
other
strong
with
an
earlier
growth
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
and
the
will
power
is
distracted
between
the
two
like
the
sap
that
flows
partly
into
the
old
condemned
leaves
partly
into
the
fresh
buds
consequently
there
is
the
strife
of
a
kingdom
divided
against
itself
sometimes
the
one
life
grows
and
flourishes
sometimes
the
other
sometimes
they
struggle
on
side
by
side
till
the
cry
is
forced
out
oh
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
and
here
again
when
the
point
of
is
reached
and
we
come
to
see
that
our
efforts
after
holiness
are
as
vain
as
our
efforts
after
acceptance
with
god
the
door
of
escape
opens
afresh
for
there
is
glory
be
to
god
a
definite
way
out
from
the
prison
life
of
sruggling
and
failure
sinning
and
repenting
wherein
many
a
soul
beats
its
wings
for
years
after
the
question
of
pardon
has
been
settled
and
that
way
is
again
the
way
of
death
a
stage
of
dying
must
come
over
the
plant
before
the
new
leaves
can
grow
and
thrive
there
must
be
a
deliberate
choice
between
the
former
growth
and
the
new
one
must
give
way
to
the
other
the
acorn
has
to
come
to
the
point
where
it
ceases
to
keep
its
rag
of
former
existence
and
lets
everything
go
to
the
fresh
shoot
the
twig
must
withdraw
its
sap
from
last
year
leaf
and
let
it
flow
into
this
year
bud
and
before
the
soul
can
really
enter
upon
a
life
of
holiness
with
all
its
blessed
endless
possibilities
a
like
choice
must
be
made
all
known
sin
must
be
deliberately
given
up
that
the
rising
current
may
have
its
full
play
but
you
say
i
have
tried
again
and
again
to
give
up
sin
i
have
prayed
and
i
have
resolved
but
the
will
finds
its
way
back
into
the
old
channels
and
is
keeping
alive
the
past
before
i
know
it
look
at
our
parable
if
you
picked
off
one
of
the
dead
leaves
and
examined
the
through
a
microscope
you
would
find
that
the
old
channel
is
silted
up
by
a
barrier
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
the
plant
has
shut
the
door
on
the
last
year
leaf
condemning
it
to
decay
and
soon
without
further
effort
the
stalk
loosens
the
winds
of
god
play
around
it
and
it
falls
away
but
where
is
the
barrier
that
we
can
place
between
ourselves
and
the
old
nature
where
is
the
sentence
of
death
that
we
can
pass
upon
it
back
to
the
cross
again
it
is
there
within
our
reach
our
old
man
is
crucified
with
him
that
the
body
of
sin
might
be
destroyed
that
henceforth
we
should
not
serve
sin
for
he
that
is
dead
is
freed
from
sin
death
to
sin
is
the
way
out
into
a
life
of
holiness
the
cross
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
shuts
off
the
life
of
sin
like
the
channel
it
stands
a
blessed
invisible
barrier
between
us
and
sinning
as
we
reckon
it
there
that
is
hold
it
there
by
faith
and
will
and
his
open
grave
is
the
open
way
into
a
life
wherein
our
rising
powers
can
develop
into
all
their
spring
vigour
the
sap
the
will
the
ego
is
withdrawn
from
the
former
existence
its
aims
and
desires
and
is
sent
into
the
new
it
is
given
over
to
the
other
side
we
hold
to
it
that
this
is
now
our
life
the
only
one
that
has
the
right
to
be
we
reckon
ourselves
dead
to
the
old
we
reckon
ourselves
alive
to
the
new
putting
off
the
former
putting
on
the
latter
take
a
practical
instance
an
old
habit
of
doubting
and
fearing
asserts
itself
in
your
soul
alive
and
strong
you
have
two
things
to
do
close
the
door
upon
the
doubt
shut
your
eyes
to
it
reckon
yourself
dead
to
it
and
then
reckon
into
life
the
growth
of
faith
in
your
soul
and
put
all
your
force
into
believing
lift
up
your
eyes
to
the
god
in
whom
you
believe
believe
in
the
teeth
of
everything
as
if
the
cause
for
doubt
were
not
there
then
the
sap
ceasing
from
feeding
the
old
shoot
will
flow
into
the
new
but
is
it
an
act
or
a
gradual
process
this
putting
off
the
old
man
it
is
both
it
is
a
resolve
taken
once
for
all
but
carried
out
in
detail
day
by
day
the
first
hour
that
the
sap
begins
to
withdraw
and
the
begins
to
silt
up
the
leaf
fate
is
sealed
there
is
never
a
moment
reversal
of
the
decision
each
day
that
follows
is
a
steady
carrying
out
of
the
plant
purpose
this
old
leaf
shall
die
and
the
new
leaf
shall
live
so
with
your
soul
come
to
the
decision
once
for
all
every
known
sin
shall
go
if
there
is
a
deliverance
to
be
had
i
will
have
it
put
the
cross
of
christ
in
its
mysterious
delivering
power
irrevocably
between
you
and
sinning
and
hold
on
there
that
is
your
part
and
you
must
do
it
there
is
no
further
progress
possible
to
you
till
you
make
up
your
mind
to
part
company
with
every
sin
in
which
you
know
you
are
indulging
every
sin
of
thought
word
or
deed
every
link
with
the
world
the
flesh
or
the
devil
everything
on
which
the
shadow
of
a
question
falls
as
god
light
shines
in
to
part
company
not
by
a
series
of
gradual
struggles
but
by
an
honest
act
of
renouncing
maintained
by
faith
and
obedience
and
as
you
make
the
decision
up
to
your
present
knowledge
you
must
determine
that
this
is
henceforth
your
attitude
towards
all
that
is
not
of
the
father
as
his
growing
light
shall
reveal
it
from
his
side
god
will
come
in
with
a
breath
of
his
resurrection
power
for
the
cross
and
the
empty
tomb
can
not
be
long
divided
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
life
can
work
now
as
you
deliberately
loose
hold
of
all
clinging
to
sin
the
expulsive
power
of
his
working
within
and
the
play
of
his
winds
around
will
make
you
free
indeed
like
these
young
shoots
when
last
year
leaves
have
fallen
this
brings
us
to
the
positive
side
for
when
the
sentence
of
death
on
the
old
nature
is
realised
the
new
nature
can
be
manifested
separation
from
all
known
sin
is
the
for
santification
not
the
goal
it
is
only
the
negative
side
of
holiness
it
is
only
reaching
the
place
where
god
can
develop
his
ideal
in
us
unhindered
it
is
when
the
death
of
winter
has
done
its
work
that
the
sun
can
draw
out
in
each
plant
its
own
individuality
and
make
its
existence
full
and
fragrant
holiness
means
something
more
than
the
sweeping
away
of
the
old
leaves
of
sin
it
means
the
life
of
jesus
developed
in
us
no
matter
if
we
feel
utterly
helpless
before
that
lovely
life
of
his
given
the
conditions
the
hidden
power
within
and
the
old
outlets
of
growth
shut
off
the
sun
will
do
the
rest
out
of
the
midst
of
apparent
lifelessness
of
barrenness
of
difficulty
the
blossoms
will
be
drawn
forth
do
not
let
us
limit
the
holy
one
of
israel
by
putting
off
his
power
to
work
this
miracle
into
a
distant
future
how
hopeless
the
naked
wood
of
a
fruit
tree
would
look
to
us
in
february
if
we
had
never
seen
the
marvel
of
springtime
yet
the
heavenly
bloom
bursts
straight
out
with
hardly
an
intermediate
step
of
new
growth
look
again
at
a
flowering
rush
the
crest
breaks
forth
from
nothingness
out
of
the
pith
come
crowding
the
golden
brown
blossoms
till
there
is
hardly
room
to
receive
them
what
more
do
we
need
for
our
souls
than
to
have
this
god
for
our
god
once
allow
the
manifestation
of
his
grace
in
these
poor
hearts
of
ours
to
be
a
miracle
and
there
is
no
need
to
defer
it
vaguely
how
many
of
the
wonders
wrought
by
christ
on
earth
lay
in
concentrating
the
long
processes
of
nature
into
a
sudden
act
of
power
the
sick
would
many
of
them
have
been
healed
by
degrees
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
the
lapse
of
years
would
have
brought
about
the
withering
of
the
the
storm
would
have
spent
itself
in
few
hours
the
miracle
in
each
case
consisted
in
the
slow
process
being
quickened
by
the
divine
breath
and
condensed
into
a
moment
can
not
we
trust
him
for
like
marvels
in
our
souls
there
too
a
day
is
with
the
lord
as
a
thousand
years
there
is
no
needs
be
on
his
part
that
he
should
prolong
this
first
act
of
makings
us
holy
over
the
rest
of
our
lives
a
miracle
a
wonder
is
all
that
we
need
and
he
is
the
god
that
doeth
wonders
satan
is
quite
content
that
we
should
have
faith
for
future
sanctification
just
as
he
was
content
that
we
should
have
faith
for
future
salvation
it
is
when
the
soul
rises
to
here
and
now
that
he
trembles
whatever
is
the
next
grace
for
your
soul
can
you
believe
for
its
supply
at
once
straight
out
from
the
dry
bare
need
process
is
very
simple
and
very
swift
whatsoever
things
ye
desire
when
ye
pray
believe
that
ye
receive
them
and
ye
shall
have
them
and
not
only
with
the
barrenness
of
our
souls
can
god
deal
with
his
quickening
breath
but
with
our
difficulties
as
well
with
those
things
in
our
surroundings
that
seem
the
most
unfavourable
see
this
bit
of
the
whole
year
round
the
thorn
has
been
hardening
and
sharpening
spring
comes
the
thorn
does
not
drop
off
and
it
does
not
soften
there
it
is
as
uncompromising
as
ever
but
up
appear
two
brown
furry
balls
mere
specks
at
first
that
break
at
last
straight
out
of
last
year
thorn
into
a
blaze
of
fragrant
golden
glory

just
when
it
seems
most
hopelessly
unyielding
holding
on
through
the
spring
days
alive
and
strong
it
is
then
that
the
tiny
buds
appear
that
soon
will
clothe
it
with
glory
take
the
very
hardest
thing
in
your
life
the
place
of
difficulty
outward
or
inward
and
expect
god
to
triumph
gloriously
in
that
very
spot
just
there
he
can
bring
your
soul
into
blossom
and
so
the
expands
till
it
passes
once
more
into
the
shadow
of
calvary
for
the
blessedness
of
receiving
is
not
all
that
god
has
for
us
a
new
world
lies
beyond
a
world
of
giving
a
giving
first
to
god
in
surrender
then
to
man
in
sacrifice
a
flower
that
stops
short
at
its
flowering
misses
its
purpose
we
were
created
for
more
than
our
own
spiritual
development
reproduction
not
mere
development
is
the
goal
of
matured
being
reproduction
in
other
lives
there
is
a
tendency
in
some
characters
running
parallel
to
the
high
cultivation
that
spends
its
whole
energy
on
the
production
of
bloom
at
the
expense
of
seed
the
flowers
that
are
bent
on
perfecting
themselves
by
becoming
double
end
in
barrenness
and
a
like
barrenness
comes
to
the
soul
whose
interests
are
all
concentrated
upon
its
own
spiritual
heedless
of
the
needs
around
the
true
ideal
flower
is
the
one
that
uses
its
gifts
as
means
to
an
end
the
brightness
and
sweetness
are
not
for
its
own
glory
they
are
but
to
attract
the
bees
and
butterflies
that
will
fertilise
and
make
it
fruitful
all
may
go
when
the
work
is
done
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
and
we
ourselves
are
saved
to
save
we
are
made
to
give
to
let
everything
go
if
only
we
may
have
more
to
give
the
pebble
takes
in
all
the
rays
of
light
that
fall
on
it
but
the
diamond
flashes
them
out
again
every
little
facet
is
a
means
not
simply
of
drinking
more
in
but
of
giving
more
out
the
unearthly
loveliness
of
the
opal
arises
from
the
same
process
carried
on
within
the
stone
the
microscope
shows
it
to
be
shattered
through
and
through
with
numberless
fissures
that
catch
and
refract
and
radiate
every
ray
that
they
can
seize
yes
there
lies
before
us
a
beautiful
possible
life
one
that
shall
have
a
passion
for
giving
that
shall
be
poured
forth
to
god
spent
out
for
man
that
shall
be
consecrated
for
the
hardest
work
and
the
darkest
sinners
but
how
are
we
to
enter
in
how
are
we
to
escape
from
the
that
holds
us
even
after
the
has
loosed
its
grasp
back
to
the
cross
not
only
from
the
world
of
condemnation
and
from
the
world
of
sinning
does
it
free
us
as
we
accept
it
but
from
the
power
of
outward
things
and
from
the
thraldom
of
self
not
only
does
it
open
the
door
into
the
world
of
acquittal
and
again
into
that
of
holiness
but
yet
again
into
the
new
realm
of
surrender
and
thence
into
that
of
sacrifice
for
the
essential
idea
of
the
cross
is
a
life
lost
to
be
found
again
in
those
around
let
us
look
at
god
picturing
as
the
plant
develops
there
comes
a
fresh
stage
of
yielding
at
first
it
was
only
the
dead
disfiguring
leaves
that
had
to
go
now
it
is
the
fair
new
petals
they
must
fall
and
for
no
visible
reason
no
one
seems
enriched
by
the
stripping
and
the
first
step
into
the
realm
of
giving
is
a
like
surrender
not
manward
but
godward
an
utter
yielding
of
our
best
so
long
as
our
idea
of
surrender
is
limited
to
the
renouncing
of
unlawful
things
we
have
never
grasped
its
true
meaning
that
is
not
worthy
of
the
name
for
no
polluted
thing
can
be
offered
the
life
lost
on
the
cross
was
not
a
sinful
one
the
treasure
poured
forth
there
was
treasure
lawful
and
right
to
be
kept
only
that
there
was
the
life
of
the
world
at
stake
death
to
lawful
things
is
the
way
out
into
a
life
of
surrender
look
at
this
buttercup
as
it
begins
to
learn
its
new
lesson
the
little
hands
of
the
calyx
clasp
tightly
in
the
bud
round
the
beautiful
petals
in
the
young
flower
their
grasp
grows
more
elastic
loosening
somewhat
in
the
daytime
but
keeping
the
power
of
contracting
able
to
close
in
again
during
a
rainstorm
or
when
night
comes
on
but
see
the
central
flower
which
has
reached
its
maturity
the
calyx
hands
have
unclasped
utterly
now
they
have
folded
themselves
back
past
all
power
of
closing
again
upon
the
petals
leaving
the
golden
crown
free
to
float
away
when
god
time
comes
have
we
learned
the
buttercup
lesson
yet
are
our
hands
off
the
very
blossom
of
our
life
are
all
things
even
the
treasures
that
he
has
sanctified
held
loosely
ready
to
be
parted
with
without
a
struggle
when
he
asks
for
them
it
is
not
in
the
partial
relaxing
of
grasp
with
power
to
take
back
again
that
this
fresh
victory
of
death
is
won
it
is
won
when
that
very
power
of
taking
back
is
yielded
when
our
hands
like
the
little
calyx
hands
of
god
buttercups
are
not
only
taken
off
but
folded
behind
our
back
in
utter
abandonment
death
means
a
loosened
grasp
loosened
beyond
all
power
of
grasping
again
and
it
is
no
strange
thing
that
happens
to
us
if
god
takes
us
at
our
word
and
strips
us
for
a
while
of
all
that
made
life
beautiful
it
may
be
outward
things
bodily
comfort
leisure
culture
reputation
friendships
that
have
to
drift
away
as
our
hands
refuse
to
clasp
on
anything
but
god
will
for
us
or
it
may
be
on
our
inner
life
that
the
stripping
falls
and
we
have
to
leave
the
sunny
lands
of
spiritual
enjoyment
for
one
after
another
of
battlefields
where
every
inch
of
our
foothold
has
to
be
tested
where
even
it
may
seem
to
give
way
till
no
experience
no
remains
to
us
in
heaven
or
earth
but
god
himself
till
we
are
wrecked
upon
god
have
faith
like
the
flowers
to
let
the
old
things
go
earn
his
beatitude
his
blessed
is
he
whosoever
shall
not
be
offended
in
me
the
beatitude
of
the
trusting
as
it
has
well
been
called
even
if
you
have
to
earn
it
like
john
the
baptist
in
an
hour
of
desolation
you
have
told
him
that
you
want
him
only
are
you
ready
to
ratify
the
words
when
his
emptying
begins
to
come
is
god
enough
is
it
still
my
god
that
you
cry
even
as
jesus
cried
when
nothing
else
was
left
him
yes
practical
death
with
him
to
lawful
things
is
just
letting
go
even
as
he
on
the
cross
let
go
all
but
god
it
is
not
to
be
reached
by
struggling
for
it
but
simply
by
yielding
as
the
body
yields
at
last
to
the
physical
death
that
lays
hold
on
it
as
the
dying
calyx
yields
its
flower
only
to
no
iron
law
with
its
merciless
grasp
do
we
let
ourselves
go
but
into
the
hands
of
the
father
it
is
there
that
our
spirit
falls
as
we
are
made
conformable
unto
the
death
of
jesus
does
all
this
seem
hard
does
any
soul
young
in
this
life
and
in
that
to
come
shrink
back
and
say
i
would
rather
keep
in
the
springtime
i
do
not
want
to
reach
unto
the
things
that
are
before
if
it
must
mean
all
this
of
pain
to
such
comes
the
master
voice
fear
none
of
those
things
which
thou
shalt
suffer
you
are
right
to
be
glad
in
his
april
days
while
he
gives
them
every
stage
of
the
heavenly
growth
in
us
is
lovely
to
him
he
is
the
god
of
the
daisies
and
the
lambs
and
the
merry
child
hearts
it
may
be
that
no
such
path
of
loss
lies
before
you
there
are
people
like
the
lands
where
spring
and
summer
weave
the
year
between
them
and
the
autumn
processes
are
hardly
noticed
as
they
come
and
go
the
one
thing
is
to
keep
obedient
in
spirit
then
you
will
be
ready
to
let
the
pass
if
he
bids
you
when
the
sun
of
his
love
has
worked
some
more
ripening
you
will
feel
by
then
that
to
try
to
keep
the
withering
blossoms
would
be
to
cramp
and
ruin
your
soul
it
is
loss
to
keep
when
god
says
for
here
again
death
is
the
gate
of
life
it
is
an
entering
in
not
a
going
forth
only
it
means
a
liberating
of
new
powers
as
the
former
treasures
float
away
like
the
dying
petals
we
can
not
feel
a
consciousness
of
death
the
words
are
a
contradiction
in
terms
if
we
had
literally
passed
out
of
this
world
into
the
next
we
should
not
feel
dead
we
should
only
be
conscious
of
a
new
wonderful
life
beating
within
us
our
consciousness
of
death
would
be
an
entirely
negative
matter
the
old
pains
would
be
unable
to
touch
us
the
old
bonds
would
be
unable
to
fetter
us
our
actual
consciousness
would
have
passed
into
the
new
existence
we
should
be
independent
of
the
old
and
a
like
independence
is
the
characteristic
of
the
new
flood
of
resurrection
life
that
comes
to
our
souls
as
we
learn
this
fresh
lesson
of
dying
a
grand
independence
of
any
earthly
thing
to
satisfy
our
soul
the
liberty
of
those
who
have
nothing
to
lose
because
they
have
nothing
to
keep
we
can
do
without
anything
while
we
have
god
hallelujah
nor
is
this
all
look
at
the
expression
of
abandonment
about
this
calyx
as
time
goes
on
and
it
begins
to
grow
towards
the
end
for
which
it
has
had
to
count
all
things
but
loss
the
look
of
dumb
emptiness
has
gone
it
is
flung
back
joyously
now
for
simultaneously
with
the
new
dying
a
richer
life
has
begun
to
work
at
its
heart
so
much
death
so
much
life
for
ever
with
death
it
weaveth
the
warp
and
woof
of
the
world
the
lovely
petals
that
have
drifted
away
are
almost
forgotten
in
the
reaching
forth
unto
the
things
that
are
before
the
has
begun
to
form
it
is
yielded
to
bring
forth
fruit
yes
there
is
another
stage
to
be
developed
in
us
after
the
lesson
of
absolute
unquestioning
surrender
to
god
has
been
learnt
a
life
that
has
been
poured
forth
to
him
must
find
its
crown
its
completion
in
being
poured
forth
for
man
it
must
grow
out
of
surrender
into
sacrifice
they
first
gave
their
own
selves
to
the
lord
and
unto
us
by
the
will
of
god
back
to
the
cross
once
more
if
there
is
any
place
where
this
fresh
lesson
can
be
learnt
it
is
there
hereby
perceive
we
the
love
of
god
because
he
laid
down
his
life
for
us
and
we
ought
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
brethren
it
is
the
very
love
of
calvary
that
must
come
down
into
our
souls
yea
if
i
be
poured
forth
upon
the
service
of
your
faith
i
joy
and
rejoice
with
you
all
so
spoke
the
apostle
who
drank
most
deeply
into
the
master
spirit
and
again
death
worketh
in
us
but
life
in
you
neither
count
i
my
life
dear
unto
myself
that
i
may
finish
the
ministry
deeper
and
deeper
must
be
the
dying
for
wider
and
fuller
is
the
lifetide
that
it
is
to
liberate
no
longer
limited
by
the
narrow
range
of
our
own
being
but
with
endless
powers
of
multiplying
in
other
souls
death
must
reach
the
very
springs
of
our
nature
to
set
it
free
it
is
not
this
thing
or
that
thing
that
must
go
now
it
is
blindly
helplessly
recklessly
our
very
selves
a
dying
must
come
upon
all
that
would
hinder
god
working
through
us
all
interests
all
impulses
all
energies
that
are
born
of
the
flesh
all
that
is
merely
human
and
apart
from
his
spirit
only
thus
can
the
life
of
jesus
in
its
intensity
of
love
for
sinners
have
its
way
in
our
souls
death
to
self
is
the
way
out
into
a
life
of
sacrifice
this
dandelion
has
long
ago
surrendered
its
golden
petals
and
has
reached
its
crowning
stage
of
dying
the
delicate
must
break
up
now
it
gives
and
gives
till
it
has
nothing
left
what
a
revolution
would
come
over
the
world
the
world
of
starving
bodies
at
home
the
world
of
starving
souls
abroad
if
something
like
this
were
the
standard
of
giving
if
god
people
ventured
on
making
themselves
poor
as
jesus
did
for
the
sake
of
the
need
around
if
the
i
me
mine
were
practically
delivered
up
no
longer
to
be
recognised
when
they
clash
with
those
needs
the
hour
of
this
new
dying
is
clearly
defined
to
the
dandelion
globe
it
is
marked
by
detachment
there
is
no
sense
of
wrenching
it
stands
ready
holding
up
its
little
life
not
knowing
when
or
where
or
how
the
wind
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
may
carry
it
away
it
holds
itself
no
longer
for
its
own
keeping
only
as
something
to
be
given
a
breath
does
the
rest
turning
the
readiness
to
will
into
the
performance
cor
and
to
a
soul
that
through
deaths
oft
has
been
brought
to
this
point
even
acts
that
look
as
if
they
must
involve
an
effort
become
something
natural
spontaneous
full
of
a
heavenly
involuntariness
so
simply
are
they
the
outcome
of
the
indwelling
love
of
christ
shall
we
not
ask
god
to
convict
us
as
to
where
lies
the
hindrance
to
this
it
is
not
alone
mere
selfishness
in
its
ordinary
sense
that
prevents
it
long
after
this
has
been
cleansed
away
by
the
precious
blood
there
may
remain
unrecognised
the
in
more
subtle
forms
it
may
with
much
that
looks
like
sacrifice
there
may
be
much
of
usefulness
and
of
outward
and
yet
below
the
surface
may
remain
a
clinging
to
our
own
judgment
a
confidence
in
our
own
resources
an
unconscious
taking
of
our
own
way
even
in
god
service
and
these
things
hold
down
hold
in
our
souls
and
frustrate
the
spirit
in
his
working
the
latent
needs
to
be
brought
down
into
the
place
of
death
before
his
breath
can
carry
us
hither
and
thither
as
the
wind
wafts
the
seeds
are
we
ready
for
this
last
surrender
do
you
ask
does
god
really
mean
the
emptying
to
reach
so
far
as
this
study
the
inner
life
of
jesus
i
speak
not
of
myself
he
says
i
can
of
mine
own
self
do
nothing
i
seek
not
mine
own
will
but
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me
his
human
sinless
though
it
was
was
laid
down
that
he
might
live
by
the
father
and
our
defiled
and
worthless
shall
we
not
lay
it
down
that
we
may
live
by
him
but
how
again
not
by
struggling
and
wrestling
but
by
dying
to
it
in
jesus
i
am
crucified
with
christ
i
myself
in
the
very
essence
of
my
being
i
let
myself
go
to
that
death
and
by
the
mysterious
power
with
which
god
meets
faith
i
find
that
he
has
made
it
true
the
bonds
are
loosed
and
he
can
have
his
way
with
me
see
in
these
wild
how
the
last
tiny
threads
must
be
broken
and
with
that
loosing
all
that
they
have
is
free
for
god
use
in
his
world
around
all
reluctance
all
calculating
all
holding
in
is
gone
the
husks
are
opened
wide
the
seeds
can
shed
themselves
unhindered
again
and
again
has
a
breaking
come
the
seed
broke
to
let
go
the
shoot
the
broke
to
let
go
the
leaf
and
the
to
let
go
the
flower
but
all
to
no
practical
avail
if
there
is
a
holding
back
now
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
and
sacrifice
is
the
very
of
love
may
god
shew
us
every
witholding
thread
of
self
that
needs
breaking
still
and
may
his
own
touch
shrivel
it
into
death
see
how
this
bit
of
is
emptying
itself
out
look
at
the
with
which
the
loose
all
that
they
have
to
yield
and
then
the
patient
content
with
which
they
fold
their
hands
the
content
of
finished
work
she
hath
done
what
she
could
oh
the
depth
of
rest
that
falls
on
the
soul
when
the
voice
of
the
beloved
speaks
those
words
will
they
be
said
to
us
the
hopes
for
nothing
again
it
seeks
only
the
chance
of
shedding
itself
its
purpose
is
fulfilled
when
the
wind
shakes
forth
the
last
seed
and
the
is
beaten
low
by
the
autumn
storms
it
not
only
spends
but
is
spent
out
at
last
it
is
through
christ
poverty
that
we
are
rich
as
poor
in
their
turn
yet
making
many
rich
is
the
mark
of
those
who
follow
his
steps
are
we
following
his
steps
are
we
how
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
are
crying
out
for
all
the
powers
of
giving
and
living
and
loving
that
are
locked
up
in
hearts
at
home
how
the
waste
places
are
pleading
dumbly
for
the
treasure
that
lies
there
in
abundance
stored
as
it
were
in
the
seedvessels
of
god
garden
that
have
not
been
broken
not
emptied
for
his
world
not
freed
for
his
use
shall
we
not
free
it
all
it
is
not
grudgingly
or
of
necessity
that
the
little
caskets
break
up
and
scatter
the
seed
but
with
the
cheerful
giving
that
god
loves
have
you
ever
noticed
how
often
the
emptied
calyx
grows
into
a
diadem
and
they
stand
crowned
for
their
ministry
as
if
they
gloried
in
their
power
to
give
as
the
time
draws
near
even
here
in
measure
the
faithfulness
unto
death
and
the
crown
of
life
go
together
even
here
if
we
suffer
we
shall
also
reign
with
him
it
is
when
the
sun
goes
out
from
our
horizon
to
light
up
the
dayspring
in
lands
that
the
glory
of
the
day
comes
on
it
is
in
the
autumn
when
the
harvest
is
gathered
and
the
fruit
is
stored
for
the
use
of
man
that
the
glow
of
red
and
gold
touches
and
transfigures
bush
and
tree
with
a
beauty
that
the
summer
days
never
knew
so
with
us
the
clear
pure
dawn
of
cleansing
through
the
blood
the
sunrise
gladness
of
resurrection
life
the
light
and
warmth
of
growth
and
service
all
are
good
in
their
own
order
but
he
who
stops
short
there
misses
the
crown
of
glory
before
which
the
brightness
of
former
days
grows
poor
and
cold
it
is
when
the
glow
and
radiance
of
a
life
delivered
up
to
death
begins
to
gather
a
life
poured
forth
to
jesus
and
for
his
sake
to
others
it
is
then
that
even
the
commonest
things
put
on
a
new
beauty
as
in
the
sunset
for
his
life
becomes
manifest
in
our
mortal
flesh
a
bloom
comes
on
the
soul
like
the
bloom
on
the
fruit
as
its
hour
of
sacrifice
arrives
oh
that
we
may
learn
to
die
to
all
that
is
of
self
with
this
royal
joyfulness
that
swallows
up
death
in
victory
in
god
world
around
he
can
make
every
step
of
the
path
full
of
the
triumph
of
gladness
that
glows
in
the
golden
leaves
glory
be
to
his
name
and
the
outcome
like
the
outcome
of
the
autumn
is
this
there
is
a
new
power
set
free
a
power
of
multiplying
life
around
the
promise
to
christ
was
that
because
he
poured
forth
his
soul
unto
death
he
should
see
his
seed
and
he
leads
his
children
in
their
little
measure
by
the
same
road
over
and
over
the
promise
of
seed
is
linked
with
sacrifice
as
with
abraham
and
rebekah
and
ruth
those
who
at
his
bidding
have
forsaken
all
receive
an
more
now
in
this
time
for
sacrifice
is
god
factor
in
his
work
of
multiplying
except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
die
it
abideth
alone
but
if
it
die
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
it
is
the
life
that
god
blesses
the
life
that
heeds
not
itself
if
only
other
souls
may
be
won
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
is
one
of
god
nursery
lessons
to
his
children
give
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
comes
further
on
the
reason
is
this
that
into
the
being
that
is
ready
to
let
the
go
god
the
holy
ghost
can
come
and
dwell
and
work
unfettered
and
by
that
indwelling
he
will
manifest
within
us
his
wonderful
divine
power
of
communicating
vitality
of
reproducing
the
image
of
jesus
in
souls
around
it
is
true
that
it
is
a
rule
that
sometimes
has
exceptions
there
are
those
to
whom
a
blessed
life
of
fruitfulness
to
god
comes
in
a
simple
way
with
seemingly
no
hard
process
of
dying
involved
just
as
there
are
plants
that
reproduce
themselves
by
bulb
and
tuber
sucker
and
shoot
without
going
through
the
stripping
and
scattering
that
we
have
been
watching
but
the
law
of
creation
is
the
herb
yielding
seed
and
the
yielding
fruit
after
its
kind
whose
seed
is
in
itself
and
let
us
count
it
all
joy
if
this
law
is
carried
out
in
us
if
it
die
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
whether
it
is
laid
down
in
toil
among
the
lost
or
in
travail
of
soul
among
his
children
that
christ
be
formed
in
them
either
way
there
will
be
life
brought
forth
it
does
not
follow
that
every
seed
will
spring
up
it
is
not
so
in
the
natural
world
the
plant
business
is
to
scatter
it
not
withholding
not
knowing
which
shall
prosper
either
this
or
that
or
whether
they
both
shall
be
alike
good
once
scattered
the
responsibility
is
transferred
to
the
ground
that
receives
it
but
the
aim
of
the
plant
the
goal
of
all
the
budding
and
blossoming
and
ripening
is
that
every
seed
should
carry
potential
life
thus
are
we
responsible
not
for
the
tangible
results
of
our
ministry
to
others
but
for
its
being
a
ministry
in
demonstration
of
the
spirit
and
of
power
such
a
ministry
as
will
make
those
around
us
definitely
responsible
to
god
for
accepting
or
rejecting
the
fulness
of
his
salvation
if
so
the
signs
following
will
not
be
wanting
it
will
be
to
the
one
the
savour
of
death
unto
death
and
to
the
other
the
savour
of
life
unto
life
but
whether
they
will
hear
or
whether
they
will
forbear
they
shall
know
that
there
hath
been
a
prophet
among
them
but
even
when
the
plant
goal
is
reached
it
is
not
a
finality
there
is
no
end
in
nature
but
every
end
is
a
beginning
every
ultimate
fact
is
only
the
beginning
of
a
new
series
emerson
while
the
earth
remaineth
and
harvest
shall
not
cease
life
leads
on
to
new
death
and
new
death
back
to
life
again
over
and
over
when
we
think
we
know
our
lesson
we
find
ourselves
beginning
another
round
of
god
divine
spiral
in
deaths
oft
is
the
measure
of
our
growth
always
delivered
unto
death
for
jesus
sake
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
might
be
made
manifest
in
our
mortal
flesh
this
bit
of
sphagnum
shows
the
process
in
miniature
stage
after
stage
of
dying
has
been
gone
through
and
each
has
been
all
the
while
crowned
with
life
each
time
that
the
crown
has
sunk
down
again
into
death
that
death
has
again
been
crowned
in
the
act
of
dying
and
the
life
all
the
time
is
the
apparent
thing
the
daily
dying
that
underlies
it
is
out
of
sight
to
the
passing
glance
yes
life
is
the
uppermost
resurrection
life
radiant
and
joyful
and
strong
for
we
represent
down
here
him
who
liveth
and
was
dead
and
is
alive
for
evermore
stress
had
to
be
laid
in
these
pages
on
the
death
gateway
but
a
gateway
is
never
a
the
is
never
meant
for
our
souls
to
stay
and
brood
over
but
to
pass
through
with
a
will
into
the
light
beyond
we
may
and
must
like
the
plants
bear
its
marks
but
they
should
be
visible
to
god
rather
than
to
man
for
above
all
and
through
all
is
the
inflowing
overflowing
life
of
jesus
oh
let
us
not
dim
it
by
a
shadow
of
morbidness
or
of
gloom
he
is
not
a
god
of
the
dead
but
a
god
of
the
living
and
he
would
have
us
let
the
glory
of
his
gladness
shine
out
think
of
the
wonder
of
it
the
fountain
of
life
himself
wells
up
within
us
taking
the
place
of
all
that
we
have
delivered
bit
by
bit
into
his
grave
i
live
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
little
have
we
proved
any
of
us
the
resources
that
lie
in
that
mighty
indwelling
little
have
we
learnt
what
it
is
to
have
all
our
penetrated
by
its
power
may
god
lead
us
no
matter
what
the
cost
into
all
that
can
be
known
of
it
here
on
earth
and
the
results
need
not
end
with
our
earthly
days
should
jesus
tarry
our
works
will
follow
us
the
closing
in
of
the
signs
around
us
make
it
seem
as
if
we
should
not
taste
of
death
and
as
if
the
time
left
us
to
work
and
suffer
for
him
were
growing
very
short
but
if
that
last
gate
has
to
be
passed
before
our
spirits
are
sent
free
into
the
land
of
perfect
life
god
may
use
by
reason
of
the
wonderful
solidarity
of
his
church
the
things
that
he
has
wrought
in
us
for
the
blessing
of
souls
unknown
to
us
as
these
twigs
and
leaves
of
bygone
years
whose
individuality
is
forgotten
pass
on
vitality
still
to
the
god
only
knows
the
endless
possibilities
that
lie
folded
in
each
one
of
us
shall
we
not
let
him
have
his
way
shall
we
not
go
all
lengths
with
him
in
his
plans
for
us
not
as
these
green
things
upon
the
earth
in
their
unconsciousness
but
with
the
glory
of
free
choice
shall
we
not
translate
the
story
of
their
little
lives
into
our
own
for
all
their
teaching
of
surrender
and
sacrifice
is
no
fanciful
mysticism
it
is
a
simple
reality
that
can
be
tested
at
every
turn
nay
that
must
be
so
tested
if
we
are
apprehending
death
in
its
delivering
power
our
homes
will
not
be
slow
to
find
it
out
o
jesus
the
crucied
i
will
follow
thee
in
thy
path
inspire
me
for
the
next
step
whether
it
leads
down
into
the
shadow
of
death
or
up
into
the
light
surely
in
what
place
my
lord
the
king
shall
be
whether
in
death
or
life
even
there
also
will
thy
servant
be
amen
