a
man
from
the
north
by
arnold
bennett
author
of
the
old
wives
tale
buried
alive
new
york
george
doran
to
the
one
whom
i
most
honour
a
man
from
the
north
chapter
i
there
grows
in
the
north
country
a
certain
kind
of
youth
of
whom
it
may
be
said
that
he
is
born
to
be
a
londoner
the
metropolis
and
everything
that
appertains
to
it
that
comes
down
from
it
that
goes
up
into
it
has
for
him
an
imperious
fascination
long
before
schooldays
are
over
he
learns
to
take
a
doleful
pleasure
in
watching
the
exit
of
the
london
train
from
the
railway
station
he
stands
by
the
hot
engine
and
envies
the
very
stoker
gazing
curiously
into
the
carriages
he
wonders
that
men
and
women
who
in
a
few
hours
will
be
treading
streets
called
piccadilly
and
the
strand
can
contemplate
the
immediate
future
with
so
much
apparent
calmness
some
of
them
even
have
the
audacity
to
look
bored
he
finds
it
difficult
to
keep
from
throwing
himself
in
the
guard
van
as
it
glides
past
him
and
not
until
the
last
coach
is
a
speck
upon
the
distance
does
he
turn
away
and
nodding
absently
to
the
who
knows
him
well
go
home
to
nurse
a
vague
ambition
and
dream
of
town
london
is
the
place
where
newspapers
are
issued
books
written
and
plays
performed
and
this
youth
who
now
sits
in
an
office
reads
all
the
newspapers
he
knows
exactly
when
a
new
work
by
a
famous
author
should
appear
and
awaits
the
reviews
with
impatience
he
can
tell
you
the
names
of
the
pieces
in
the
bills
of
the
twenty
principal
theatres
what
their
quality
is
and
how
long
they
may
be
expected
to
run
and
on
the
production
of
a
new
play
the
articles
of
the
dramatic
critics
provide
him
with
sensations
almost
as
vivid
as
those
of
the
most
zealous
at
the
performance
itself
sooner
or
later
perhaps
by
painful
roads
he
reaches
the
goal
of
his
desire
london
accepts
him
on
probation
and
as
his
strength
is
so
she
demeans
herself
let
him
be
bold
and
resolute
and
she
will
make
an
obeisance
but
her
heel
is
all
too
ready
to
crush
the
coward
and
hesitant
and
her
victims
once
underfoot
do
not
often
rise
again
chapter
ii
the
antique
with
luggage
swung
unsteadily
round
by
tattersall
and
into
raphael
street
richard
thrust
down
the
window
with
a
sharp
bang
indicative
of
a
strange
new
sense
of
power
but
before
the
cab
came
to
a
standstill
he
had
collected
himself
and
managed
to
alight
with
considerable
decorum
when
the
door
opened
in
answer
to
his
second
ring
a
faint
sour
odour
escaped
from
the
house
and
he
remembered
the
friendly
feminine
warnings
which
he
had
received
at
bursley
on
the
subject
of
london
lodgings
the
aspect
of
the
landlady
however
reassured
him
she
was
a
diminutive
old
woman
in
ridiculously
short
skirts
with
a
yellow
crinkled
face
grey
eyes
and
a
warm
benevolent
smile
that
conquered
as
she
greeted
richard
she
blushed
like
a
girl
and
made
a
little
curtsey
richard
offered
his
hand
and
after
wiping
hers
on
a
clean
apron
she
took
it
timidly
i
hope
we
shall
get
on
well
together
sir
she
said
looking
straight
up
into
her
new
lodger
eyes
i
sure
we
shall
answered
richard
sincerely
she
preceded
him
up
the
narrow
frowsy
staircase
which
was
full
of
surprising
turns
you
find
these
stairs
a
bit
awkward
at
first
she
apologised
i
often
thought
of
getting
a
bit
of
nice
carpet
on
them
but
the
use
it
would
be
done
for
in
a
week
now
here
your
room
sir
first
floor
front
with
two
nice
french
windows
you
see
and
a
nice
balcony
now
about
tidying
it
of
a
morning
sir
if
you
step
out
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
you
get
up
my
daughter
shall
make
the
bed
and
dust
and
you
come
in
and
find
it
all
nice
and
straight
for
breakfast
very
well
assented
richard
that
how
i
generally
arrange
with
my
young
men
i
like
them
to
have
their
breakfast
in
a
nice
tidy
room
you
see
sir
now
what
will
you
have
for
tea
sir
a
little
nice
bread
and
butter
when
she
was
gone
richard
formally
surveyed
his
quarters
a
long
rather
low
room
its
length
cut
by
the
two
windows
which
were
rowbotham
particular
pride
between
the
windows
a
table
with
a
faded
green
cloth
and
a
small
bed
opposite
behind
the
door
an
artfully
concealed
washstand
the
mantelpiece
painted
mustard
yellow
bore
divers
squat
earthenware
figures
and
was
surmounted
by
an
oblong
mirror
framed
in
rosewood
over
the
mirror
an
illuminated
text
trust
in
jesus
and
over
the
text
an
oleograph
in
collision
with
the
ceiling
entitled
after
the
battle
of
culloden
the
walls
were
decorated
with
a
pattern
of
giant
pink
roses
and
here
and
there
hiding
the
roses
were
hung
photographs
of
persons
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
landscapes
in
oil
depicting
bridges
trees
water
and
white
sails
in
the
distance
but
the
furnishing
of
the
room
caused
richard
no
uneasiness
in
a
few
moments
he
had
mentally
arranged
how
to
make
the
place
habitable
and
thenceforth
he
only
saw
what
should
and
would
be
tea
was
brought
in
by
a
girl
whose
face
proclaimed
her
to
be
rowbotham
daughter
at
the
sight
of
her
richard
privately
winked
he
had
read
in
books
about
landladies
daughters
but
this
one
gave
the
lie
to
books
she
was
young
she
was
beautiful
and
richard
would
have
sworn
to
her
innocence
with
an
accession
of
boldness
which
surprised
himself
he
inquired
her
name
lily
sir
she
said
blushing
like
her
mother
he
cut
the
new
heavy
bread
and
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
with
the
awkwardness
of
one
unaccustomed
to
such
work
and
having
made
space
on
the
tray
set
the
evening
paper
against
the
sugar
basin
and
began
to
eat
and
read
outside
were
two
piano
organs
children
shouting
and
a
man
uttering
some
monotonous
unintelligible
cry
it
grew
dark
rowbotham
came
in
with
a
lamp
and
cleared
the
table
richard
was
looking
through
the
window
and
neither
spoke
presently
he
sat
down
that
being
his
first
night
in
london
he
had
determined
to
spend
it
quietly
the
piano
organs
and
the
children
were
still
strident
a
peculiar
feeling
of
isolation
momentarily
overcame
him
and
the
noises
of
the
street
seemed
to
recede
then
he
went
to
the
window
again
and
noticed
that
the
children
were
dancing
quite
gracefully
it
occurred
to
him
that
they
might
be
ballet
children
he
picked
up
the
paper
and
examined
the
theatrical
advertisements
at
first
idly
but
afterwards
in
detail
with
a
long
sigh
he
took
his
hat
and
stick
and
went
very
slowly
downstairs
rowbotham
heard
him
fumbling
with
the
catch
of
the
front
door
are
you
going
out
sir
only
just
for
a
walk
said
richard
nonchalantly
perhaps
i
better
give
you
a
thanks
another
moment
and
he
was
in
the
delicious
streets
going
east
chapter
iii
although
he
had
visited
london
but
once
before
and
then
only
for
a
few
hours
he
was
not
unfamiliar
with
the
topography
of
the
town
having
frequently
studied
it
in
maps
and
an
old
copy
of
kelly
directory
he
walked
slowly
up
park
side
and
through
piccadilly
picking
out
as
he
passed
them
the
french
embassy
hyde
park
corner
apsley
house
park
lane
and
devonshire
house
as
he
drank
in
the
mingled
glare
and
glamour
of
piccadilly
by
night
the
remote
stars
the
high
sombre
trees
the
vast
dazzling
interiors
of
clubs
the
sinuous
flickering
lines
of
traffic
the
radiant
faces
of
women
framed
in
hansoms
he
laughed
the
laugh
of
luxurious
contemplation
acutely
happy
at
last
at
last
he
had
come
into
his
inheritance
london
accepted
him
he
was
hers
she
his
and
nothing
should
part
them
starvation
in
london
would
itself
be
bliss
but
he
had
no
intention
of
starving
filled
with
great
purposes
he
straightened
his
back
and
just
then
a
morsel
of
mud
thrown
up
from
a
splashed
warm
and
gritty
on
his
cheek
he
wiped
it
off
caressingly
with
a
smile
although
it
was
saturday
night
and
most
of
the
shops
were
closed
an
establishment
where
watches
and
trinkets
of
gold
superb
in
appearance
and
pillowed
on
green
plush
were
retailed
at
alluring
prices
still
threw
a
brilliant
light
on
the
pavement
and
richard
crossed
the
road
to
inspect
its
wares
he
turned
away
but
retraced
his
steps
and
entered
the
shop
an
assistant
politely
inquired
his
wishes
i
want
one
of
those
hunters
you
have
in
the
window
at
said
richard
with
a
gruffness
which
must
have
been
involuntary
yes
sir
here
is
one
we
guarantee
that
the
works
are
equal
to
the
finest
english
lever
i
take
it
he
put
down
the
money
thank
you
can
i
show
you
anything
else
nothing
thanks
still
more
gruffly
we
have
some
excellent
chains
nothing
else
thanks
and
he
walked
out
putting
his
purchase
in
his
pocket
a
perfectly
reliable
gold
watch
which
he
had
worn
for
years
already
lay
there
at
piccadilly
circus
he
loitered
and
then
crossed
over
and
went
along
coventry
street
to
leicester
square
the
immense
façade
of
the
ottoman
theatre
of
varieties
with
its
rows
of
illuminated
windows
and
crescent
moons
set
against
the
sky
rose
before
him
and
the
glory
of
it
was
intoxicating
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
ottoman
held
a
stronger
fascination
for
richard
than
any
other
place
in
london
the
british
museum
fleet
street
and
the
lyceum
were
magic
names
but
more
magical
than
either
was
the
name
of
the
ottoman
the
ottoman
on
the
rare
occasions
when
it
happened
to
be
mentioned
in
bursley
was
a
synonym
for
all
the
glittering
vices
of
the
metropolis
it
stank
in
the
nostrils
of
the
london
delegates
who
came
down
to
speak
at
the
annual
meetings
of
the
local
society
for
the
suppression
of
vice
but
how
often
had
richard
somnolent
in
chapel
mitigated
the
rigours
of
a
long
sermon
by
dreaming
of
an
ottoman
ballet
one
of
those
voluptuous
spectacles
all
legs
and
white
arms
which
from
time
to
time
were
described
so
ornately
in
the
london
daily
papers
the
swinging
doors
of
the
grand
circle
entrance
were
simultaneously
opened
for
him
by
two
human
automata
dressed
exactly
alike
in
long
coats
a
very
tall
man
and
a
stunted
boy
he
advanced
with
what
air
of
custom
he
could
command
and
after
taking
a
ticket
and
traversing
a
heavily
decorated
corridor
encountered
another
pair
of
swinging
doors
they
opened
and
a
girl
passed
out
followed
by
a
man
who
was
talking
to
her
vehemently
in
french
at
the
same
moment
a
gust
of
distant
music
struck
richard
ear
as
he
climbed
a
broad
flight
of
steps
the
music
became
louder
and
a
clapping
of
hands
could
be
heard
at
the
top
of
the
steps
hung
a
curtain
of
blue
velvet
he
pushed
aside
its
stiff
heavy
folds
with
difficulty
and
entered
the
auditorium
the
smoke
of
a
thousand
cigarettes
enveloped
the
furthest
parts
of
the
great
interior
in
a
thin
bluish
haze
which
was
dissipated
as
it
reached
the
domed
ceiling
in
the
rays
of
a
crystal
chandelier
far
in
front
and
a
little
below
the
level
of
the
circle
lay
a
line
of
footlights
broken
by
the
silhouette
of
the
conductor
head
a
diminutive
solitary
figure
in
red
and
yellow
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
huge
stage
it
was
kissing
its
hands
to
the
audience
with
a
mincing
operatic
gesture
presently
it
tripped
off
backwards
stopping
at
every
third
step
to
bow
the
applause
ceased
and
the
curtain
fell
slowly
the
broad
semicircular
promenade
which
flanked
the
seats
of
the
grand
circle
was
filled
with
a
crowd
the
men
talked
and
laughed
for
the
most
part
in
little
knots
while
in
and
out
steering
their
way
easily
and
rapidly
among
these
groups
moved
the
women
some
with
rouged
cheeks
greasy
vermilion
lips
and
enormous
liquid
eyes
others
whose
faces
were
innocent
of
cosmetics
and
showed
pale
under
the
electric
light
but
all
with
a
peculiar
exaggerated
swing
of
the
body
from
the
hips
and
all
surreptitiously
regarding
themselves
in
the
mirrors
which
abounded
on
every
glowing
wall
richard
stood
aloof
against
a
pillar
near
him
were
two
men
in
evening
dress
conversing
in
tones
which
just
rose
above
the
general
murmur
of
talk
and
the
high
penetrating
tinkle
of
glass
from
the
bar
behind
the
promenade
and
what
did
she
say
then
one
of
the
pair
asked
smilingly
richard
strained
his
ear
to
listen
well
told
the
other
said
speaking
with
a
dreamy
drawl
while
fingering
his
absently
and
gazing
down
at
the
large
diamond
in
his
shirt
told
that
she
said
she
do
for
him
if
he
did
fork
out
but
i
do
believe
her
you
know
of
course
there
lottie
the
band
suddenly
began
to
play
and
after
a
few
crashing
bars
the
curtain
went
up
for
the
ballet
the
rich
which
presented
itself
provoked
a
burst
of
clapping
from
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
upper
tiers
but
to
richard
surprise
no
one
in
his
proximity
seemed
to
exhibit
any
interest
in
the
entertainment
the
two
men
still
talked
with
their
backs
to
the
stage
the
women
continued
to
find
a
pathway
between
the
groups
and
from
within
the
bar
came
the
unabated
murmur
of
voices
and
tinkle
of
glass
richard
never
took
his
dazed
eyes
from
the
stage
the
moving
pageant
unrolled
itself
before
him
like
a
vision
rousing
new
sensations
tremors
of
strange
desires
he
was
under
a
spell
and
when
at
last
the
curtain
descended
to
the
monotonous
roll
of
drums
he
awoke
to
the
fact
that
several
people
were
watching
him
curiously
blushing
slightly
he
went
to
a
far
corner
of
the
promenade
at
one
of
the
little
tables
a
woman
sat
alone
she
held
her
head
at
an
angle
and
her
laughing
lustrous
eyes
gleamed
invitingly
at
richard
without
quite
intending
to
do
so
he
hesitated
in
front
of
her
and
she
twittered
a
phrase
ending
in
he
abruptly
turned
away
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
remain
and
say
something
clever
but
his
tongue
refused
its
office
and
his
legs
moved
of
themselves
at
midnight
he
found
himself
in
piccadilly
circus
unwilling
to
go
home
he
strolled
leisurely
back
to
leicester
square
the
front
of
the
ottoman
was
in
darkness
and
the
square
almost
deserted
chapter
iv
he
walked
home
to
raphael
street
the
house
was
dead
except
for
a
pale
light
in
his
own
room
at
the
top
of
the
bare
creaking
stairs
he
fumbled
a
moment
for
the
handle
of
his
door
and
the
regular
sound
of
two
distinct
snores
descended
from
an
upper
storey
he
closed
the
door
softly
locked
it
and
glanced
round
the
room
with
some
eagerness
the
smell
of
the
expiring
lamp
compelled
him
to
unlatch
both
windows
he
extinguished
the
lamp
and
after
lighting
a
couple
of
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
drew
a
chair
to
the
fireplace
and
sat
down
to
munch
an
apple
the
thought
occurred
to
him
this
is
my
home
for
how
long
and
then
why
the
dickens
did
i
say
something
to
that
girl
between
the
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
was
a
photograph
of
his
sister
which
he
had
placed
there
before
going
out
he
looked
at
it
with
a
half
smile
and
murmured
audibly
several
times
why
the
dickens
did
i
say
something
to
that
girl
with
her
the
woman
of
the
photograph
seemed
to
be
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
she
was
fair
with
a
mild
serious
face
and
much
wavy
hair
the
forehead
was
broad
and
smooth
and
white
the
prominent
and
the
mouth
somewhat
large
the
eyes
were
a
very
light
grey
they
met
the
gaze
of
the
spectator
with
a
curious
timid
defiance
as
if
to
say
i
am
weak
but
i
can
at
least
fight
till
i
fall
underneath
the
eyes
the
portrait
was
the
work
of
an
amateur
and
consequently
had
not
been
robbed
of
all
texture
by
retouching
a
few
crowsfeet
could
be
seen
as
far
back
as
richard
memory
went
he
and
mary
had
lived
together
and
alone
in
the
small
red
house
which
lay
half
a
mile
out
of
bursley
towards
turnhill
on
the
manchester
road
at
one
time
it
had
been
rurally
situated
creeping
plants
had
clothed
its
red
walls
and
the
bare
patch
behind
it
had
been
a
garden
but
the
gradual
development
of
a
district
had
covered
the
fields
with
smooth
mountainous
heaps
of
grey
refuse
and
stunted
or
killed
every
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
the
house
was
undermined
and
in
spite
of
iron
clamps
had
lost
most
of
its
rectangles
while
the
rent
had
dropped
to
fifteen
pounds
a
year
mary
was
very
much
older
than
her
brother
and
she
had
always
appeared
to
him
exactly
the
mature
woman
of
the
photograph
of
his
parents
he
knew
nothing
except
what
mary
had
told
him
which
was
little
and
vague
for
she
watchfully
kept
the
subject
at
a
distance
she
had
supported
herself
and
richard
in
comfort
by
a
medley
of
vocations
teaching
the
piano
collecting
rents
and
practising
the
art
of
millinery
they
had
few
friends
the
social
circles
of
bursley
were
centred
in
its
churches
and
chapels
and
though
mary
attended
the
wesleyan
sanctuary
with
some
regularity
she
took
small
interest
in
bazaars
and
all
the
other
minor
religious
activities
thus
neglecting
opportunities
for
intercourse
which
might
have
proved
agreeable
she
had
sent
richard
to
the
but
when
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
protested
that
was
awful
rot
she
answered
calmly
do
go
then
and
from
that
day
his
place
in
class
was
empty
soon
afterwards
the
boy
cautiously
insinuated
that
chapel
belonged
to
the
same
category
as
but
the
hint
failed
of
its
effect
the
ladies
of
the
town
called
sometimes
generally
upon
business
and
took
afternoon
tea
once
the
vicar
wife
who
wished
to
obtain
musical
tuition
for
her
three
youngest
daughters
at
a
nominal
fee
came
in
and
found
richard
at
a
book
on
the
hearthrug
ah
said
she
just
like
his
father
is
he
not
miss
larch
mary
made
no
reply
the
house
was
full
of
books
richard
knew
them
all
well
by
sight
but
until
he
was
sixteen
he
read
only
a
select
handful
of
volumes
which
had
stood
the
test
of
years
often
he
idly
speculated
as
to
the
contents
of
some
of
the
others
horatii
opera
for
instance
had
that
anything
to
do
with
theatres
yet
for
some
curious
reason
which
when
he
grew
older
he
sought
for
in
vain
he
never
troubled
himself
to
look
into
them
mary
read
a
good
deal
chiefly
books
and
magazines
fetched
for
her
by
richard
from
the
free
library
when
he
was
about
seventeen
a
change
came
he
was
aware
dimly
and
as
if
by
instinct
that
his
sister
life
in
the
early
days
had
not
been
without
its
romance
certainly
there
was
something
hidden
between
her
and
william
vernon
the
science
master
at
the
institute
for
they
were
invariably
at
great
pains
to
avoid
each
other
he
sometimes
wondered
whether
vernon
was
connected
in
any
way
with
the
melancholy
which
was
never
even
in
her
brightest
moments
wholly
absent
from
demeanour
one
sunday
night
richard
had
been
keeping
house
mary
coming
in
late
from
chapel
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
as
he
opened
the
door
and
dragging
down
his
face
to
hers
kissed
him
hysterically
again
and
again
dicky
dick
she
whispered
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
something
happened
i
almost
an
old
woman
but
happened
i
know
said
richard
retreating
hurriedly
from
her
embrace
going
to
marry
mr
vernon
but
how
could
you
tell
oh
i
just
guessed
you
do
mind
dick
do
you
i
mind
afraid
lest
his
feelings
should
appear
too
plainly
he
asked
abruptly
for
supper
mary
gave
up
her
various
callings
the
wedding
took
place
and
william
vernon
came
to
live
with
them
it
was
then
that
richard
began
to
read
more
widely
and
to
form
a
definite
project
of
going
to
london
he
could
not
fail
to
respect
and
like
william
the
life
of
the
married
pair
seemed
to
him
idyllic
the
tender
furtive
manifestations
of
affection
which
were
constantly
passing
between
mary
and
her
sedate
husband
touched
him
deeply
and
at
the
thought
of
the
fifteen
irretrievable
years
during
which
some
ridiculous
misunderstanding
had
separated
this
loving
couple
his
eyes
were
not
quite
as
dry
as
a
youth
could
wish
but
with
it
all
he
was
uncomfortable
he
felt
himself
an
intruder
upon
holy
privacies
if
at
husband
and
wife
clasped
hands
round
the
corner
of
the
table
he
looked
at
his
plate
if
they
smiled
happily
upon
no
discoverable
provocation
he
pretended
not
to
notice
the
fact
they
did
not
need
him
their
hearts
were
full
of
kindness
for
every
living
thing
but
unconsciously
they
stood
aloof
he
was
driven
in
upon
himself
and
spent
much
of
his
time
either
in
solitary
walking
or
hidden
in
an
apartment
called
the
study
he
ordered
magazines
whose
very
names
holt
the
principal
bookseller
in
bursley
was
unfamiliar
with
and
after
the
magazines
came
books
of
verse
and
novels
enclosed
in
covers
of
mystic
design
and
printed
in
a
style
which
holt
though
secretly
impressed
set
down
as
eccentric
holt
shop
performed
the
functions
of
a
club
for
the
dignitaries
of
the
town
and
since
he
took
care
that
this
esoteric
literature
was
well
displayed
on
the
counter
until
called
for
the
young
man
fame
as
great
soon
spread
and
richard
began
to
see
that
he
was
regarded
as
a
curiosity
of
which
bursley
need
not
be
ashamed
his
already
fostered
into
lustiness
by
a
number
of
facile
school
successes
became
more
marked
although
he
was
wise
enough
to
keep
a
great
deal
of
it
to
himself
one
evening
after
mary
and
her
husband
had
been
talking
quietly
some
while
richard
came
into
the
i
do
want
any
supper
he
said
i
going
for
a
bit
of
a
walk
shall
we
tell
him
mary
asked
smiling
after
he
had
left
the
room
please
yourself
said
william
also
smiling
he
talks
a
great
deal
about
going
to
london
i
hope
he
wo
go
till
after
april
i
think
it
would
upset
me
you
need
not
trouble
i
think
my
dear
william
answered
he
talks
about
it
but
he
is
gone
yet
vernon
was
not
quite
pleased
with
richard
he
had
obtained
for
him
being
connected
with
the
best
people
in
the
town
a
position
as
shorthand
and
general
clerk
in
a
solicitor
office
and
had
learnt
privately
that
though
the
youth
was
smart
enough
he
was
scarcely
making
that
progress
which
might
have
been
expected
he
lacked
application
william
attributed
this
shortcoming
to
the
excessive
reading
of
verse
and
obscure
novels
april
came
and
as
vernon
had
foretold
richard
still
remained
in
bursley
but
the
older
man
was
now
too
deeply
absorbed
in
another
matter
to
interest
himself
at
all
in
richard
movements
a
matter
in
which
richard
himself
exhibited
a
shy
concern
hour
followed
anxious
hour
and
at
last
was
heard
the
faint
fretful
cry
of
a
child
in
the
night
then
stillness
all
that
richard
ever
saw
was
a
coffin
and
in
it
a
dead
child
at
a
dead
woman
feet
fifteen
months
later
he
was
in
london
chapter
v
curpet
of
the
firm
of
curpet
and
smythe
whose
name
was
painted
in
black
and
white
on
the
dark
green
door
had
told
him
that
the
office
hours
were
from
to
six
the
clock
of
the
law
courts
was
striking
a
quarter
to
ten
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
seized
the
handle
but
the
door
was
fast
and
he
descended
the
two
double
flights
of
iron
stairs
into
the
quadrangle
new
serjeant
court
was
a
large
modern
building
of
very
red
brick
with
facings
eight
storeys
high
but
in
spite
of
its
faults
of
colour
and
its
excessive
height
ample
wall
spaces
and
temperate
ornamentation
gave
it
a
dignity
and
comeliness
sufficient
to
distinguish
it
from
other
buildings
in
the
locality
in
the
centre
of
the
court
was
an
oval
patch
of
brown
earth
with
a
few
trees
whose
tops
struggling
towards
sunlight
reached
to
the
middle
of
the
third
storey
round
this
plantation
ran
an
immaculate
roadway
of
wooden
blocks
flanked
by
an
equally
immaculate
asphalt
footpath
the
court
possessed
its
own
private
and
these
were
wrought
of
iron
in
an
antique
design
men
and
boys
grave
and
unconsciously
oppressed
by
the
burden
of
the
coming
day
were
continually
appearing
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
long
tunnelled
entrance
and
vanishing
into
one
or
other
of
the
twelve
doorways
presently
a
carriage
and
pair
drove
in
and
stopped
opposite
richard
a
big
man
of
about
fifty
with
a
sagacious
red
and
blue
face
jumped
alertly
out
followed
by
an
attentive
clerk
carrying
a
blue
sack
it
seemed
to
richard
that
he
knew
the
features
of
the
big
man
from
portraits
and
following
the
pair
up
the
staircase
of
no
he
discovered
from
the
legend
on
the
door
through
which
they
disappeared
that
he
had
been
in
the
presence
of
her
majesty
simultaneously
with
a
misgiving
as
to
his
ability
to
reach
the
standard
of
clerical
ability
doubtless
required
by
curpet
and
smythe
who
did
business
cheek
by
jowl
with
an
and
probably
employed
him
came
an
elevation
of
spirit
as
he
darkly
guessed
what
none
can
realise
completely
that
a
man
future
lies
on
his
own
knees
and
on
the
knees
of
no
gods
whatsoever
he
continued
his
way
upstairs
but
curpet
and
smythe
portal
was
still
locked
looking
down
the
well
he
espied
a
boy
crawling
reluctantly
and
laboriously
upward
with
a
key
in
his
hand
which
he
dragged
across
the
bannisters
in
course
of
time
the
boy
reached
curpet
and
smythe
door
and
opening
it
stepped
neatly
over
a
pile
of
letters
which
lay
immediately
within
richard
followed
him
oh
my
name
larch
said
richard
as
if
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
that
the
boy
might
be
interested
in
the
fact
do
you
know
which
is
my
room
the
boy
conducted
him
along
a
dark
passage
with
green
doors
on
either
side
to
a
room
at
the
end
it
was
furnished
mainly
with
two
and
two
armchairs
in
one
corner
was
a
disused
in
another
an
immense
pile
of
reporters
on
the
mantelpiece
a
tumbler
a
duster
and
a
broken
desk
lamp
that
your
seat
said
the
boy
pointing
to
the
larger
table
and
disappeared
richard
disposed
of
his
coat
and
hat
and
sat
down
trying
to
feel
at
ease
and
not
succeeding
at
five
minutes
past
ten
a
youth
entered
with
the
times
under
his
arm
richard
waited
for
him
to
speak
but
he
merely
stared
and
took
off
his
overcoat
then
he
said
you
got
my
hook
if
you
do
mind
i
put
your
things
on
this
other
one
certainly
assented
richard
the
youth
spread
his
back
luxuriously
to
the
empty
fireplace
and
opened
the
times
when
another
and
smaller
boy
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
jenkins
alder
wants
the
the
youth
silently
handed
over
the
advertisement
pages
which
were
lying
on
the
table
in
a
minute
the
boy
returned
alder
says
he
wants
the
inside
of
the
tell
alder
to
go
to
hell
with
my
compliments
the
boy
hesitated
go
on
now
jenkins
insisted
the
boy
hung
on
the
smiling
dubiously
and
then
went
out
here
wait
a
minute
jenkins
called
him
back
perhaps
you
better
give
it
him
take
the
damn
thing
away
a
sound
of
hurried
footsteps
in
the
next
room
was
succeeded
by
an
imperious
call
for
jenkins
at
which
jenkins
slipped
nimbly
into
his
chair
and
untied
a
bundle
of
papers
jenkins
the
call
came
again
with
a
touch
of
irritation
in
it
but
jenkins
did
not
move
the
door
was
thrust
open
oh
you
are
there
jenkins
just
come
in
and
take
a
letter
down
the
tones
were
quite
placid
yes
mr
smythe
i
never
take
any
notice
of
smythe
calls
said
jenkins
when
he
returned
if
he
wants
me
he
must
either
ring
or
fetch
me
if
i
once
began
it
i
should
be
running
in
and
out
of
his
room
all
day
and
quite
enough
to
do
without
that
fidgety
eh
richard
suggested
fidgety
no
word
for
it
tell
you
alder
that
the
manager
you
know
said
only
yesterday
that
he
has
less
trouble
with
forty
chancery
actions
of
curpet
than
with
one
case
of
smythe
i
know
i
a
jolly
sight
sooner
write
forty
of
curpet
letters
than
ten
of
smythe
i
wish
i
got
your
place
and
you
got
mine
i
suppose
you
can
write
shorthand
rather
fast
middling
said
richard
about
oh
we
had
a
man
once
who
could
do
but
he
been
a
newspaper
reporter
i
do
a
bit
over
a
hundred
if
i
not
had
much
to
drink
overnight
let
see
they
giving
you
bob
are
they
richard
nodded
the
man
before
you
had
and
he
could
spell
worth
a
brass
button
i
only
get
fifteen
although
i
been
here
seven
years
a
damn
shame
i
call
it
but
curpet
beastly
near
if
he
give
some
other
people
less
and
me
a
bit
more
who
are
other
people
asked
richard
smiling
well
there
old
aked
he
sits
in
the
outer
office
you
wo
have
seen
him
because
he
does
generally
come
till
eleven
they
give
him
a
pound
a
week
just
for
doing
a
bit
of
engrossing
when
he
feels
inclined
to
engross
and
for
being
idle
when
he
feels
inclined
to
be
idle
a
something
or
other
used
to
be
clerk
to
curpet
father
he
has
some
dibs
of
his
own
and
this
just
finds
him
amusement
i
bet
he
does
do
fifty
folios
a
week
and
he
got
the
devil
own
temper
jenkins
was
proceeding
to
describe
other
members
of
the
staff
when
the
entry
of
curpet
himself
put
an
end
to
the
recital
curpet
was
a
small
man
with
a
round
face
and
a
neatly
trimmed
beard
good
morning
larch
if
you
kindly
come
into
my
room
i
dictate
my
letters
good
morning
jenkins
he
smiled
and
withdrew
leaving
richard
excessively
surprised
at
his
suave
courtesy
in
his
own
room
curpet
sat
before
a
pile
of
letters
and
motioned
richard
to
a
side
table
you
will
tell
me
if
i
go
too
fast
he
said
and
began
to
dictate
regularly
with
scarcely
a
pause
the
pile
of
letters
gradually
disappeared
into
a
basket
before
half
a
dozen
letters
were
done
richard
comprehended
that
he
had
become
part
of
a
business
machine
of
far
greater
magnitude
than
anything
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
in
bursley
this
little
man
with
the
round
face
dealt
impassively
with
tens
of
thousands
of
pounds
he
mortgaged
whole
streets
bullied
railway
companies
and
wrote
familiarly
to
lords
in
the
middle
of
one
long
letter
a
man
came
panting
in
whom
richard
at
once
took
for
alder
the
chancery
manager
his
rather
battered
silk
hat
was
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
looked
distressed
i
sorry
to
say
we
lost
that
summons
in
rice
the
r
railway
really
said
curpet
better
appeal
and
brief
a
leader
eh
ca
appeal
mr
curpet
well
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
telegraph
to
the
country
write
and
keep
them
calm
it
a
pity
they
were
so
sure
rice
will
have
to
economise
for
a
year
or
two
what
was
my
last
word
larch
the
dictation
proceeded
one
hour
was
allowed
for
lunch
and
richard
spent
the
first
moiety
of
it
in
viewing
the
ambrosial
exteriors
of
strand
restaurants
with
the
exception
of
the
at
bursley
he
had
never
been
in
a
restaurant
in
his
life
and
he
was
timid
of
entering
any
of
those
sumptuous
establishments
whose
swinging
doors
gave
glimpses
of
richly
decorated
ceilings
gleaming
tablecloths
and
men
in
silk
hats
greedily
consuming
dishes
placed
before
them
by
obsequious
waiters
at
last
without
quite
knowing
how
he
got
there
he
sat
in
a
long
low
apartment
papered
like
an
attic
bedroom
and
odorous
of
tea
and
cake
the
place
was
crowded
with
young
men
and
women
indifferently
who
bent
over
uncomfortably
small
oblong
tables
an
increasing
clatter
of
crockery
filled
the
air
waitresses
with
pale
vacant
faces
dressed
in
dingy
black
with
white
aprons
moved
about
with
difficulty
at
varying
rates
of
speed
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
betray
an
interest
in
richard
behind
the
counter
on
which
stood
great
polished
urns
emitting
clouds
of
steam
were
several
women
whose
superior
rank
in
the
restaurant
was
denoted
by
a
black
apron
and
after
five
minutes
had
elapsed
richard
observed
one
of
these
damsels
pointing
out
himself
to
a
waitress
who
approached
and
listened
condescendingly
to
his
order
a
thin
man
rather
more
than
with
a
grey
beard
and
slightly
red
nose
entered
and
sat
down
opposite
to
richard
without
preface
he
began
speaking
rather
fast
and
with
an
expressive
vivacity
rarely
met
with
in
the
ageing
well
my
young
friend
how
do
you
like
your
new
place
richard
stared
at
him
are
you
mr
aked
the
same
i
suppose
master
jenkins
has
made
you
acquainted
with
all
my
peculiarities
of
temper
and
glass
of
milk
roll
and
two
pats
of
butter
and
i
say
my
girl
try
not
to
keep
me
waiting
as
long
as
you
did
yesterday
there
was
a
bright
smile
on
his
face
which
the
waitress
unwillingly
returned
do
you
know
he
went
on
looking
at
richard
plate
do
you
know
that
tea
and
ham
together
are
frightfully
indigestible
i
never
have
indigestion
no
matter
you
soon
will
have
if
you
eat
tea
and
ham
together
a
young
man
should
guard
his
digestion
like
his
honour
sounds
funny
it
but
it
right
an
impaired
digestive
apparatus
has
ruined
many
a
career
it
ruined
mine
you
see
before
you
sir
what
might
have
been
an
author
of
repute
but
for
a
wayward
stomach
you
write
richard
asked
interested
at
once
but
afraid
lest
aked
might
be
cumbrously
joking
i
used
to
the
old
man
spoke
with
proud
have
you
written
a
book
not
a
book
but
i
contributed
to
all
manner
of
magazines
and
newspapers
what
magazines
well
let
me
see
it
so
long
ago
i
written
for
i
wrote
for
when
thackeray
edited
it
i
spoke
to
carlyle
once
you
did
yes
carlyle
said
to
me
carlyle
said
to
me
carlyle
said
aked
voice
dwindled
to
an
inarticulate
murmur
and
suddenly
ignoring
richard
presence
he
pulled
a
book
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
finger
the
leaves
it
was
a
french
novel
la
vie
de
bohème
his
face
had
lost
all
its
mobile
expressiveness
a
little
alarmed
by
such
eccentricity
and
not
quite
sure
that
this
associate
of
carlyle
was
perfectly
sane
richard
sat
silent
waiting
for
events
aked
was
clearly
accustomed
to
reading
while
he
ate
he
could
even
drink
with
his
eyes
on
the
book
at
length
he
pushed
his
plates
away
from
him
and
closed
the
novel
with
a
snap
i
see
you
from
the
country
larch
he
said
as
if
there
had
been
no
lapse
in
the
conversation
now
why
in
god
name
did
you
leave
the
country
are
there
enough
people
in
london
because
wanted
to
be
an
author
answered
richard
with
more
assurance
than
veracity
though
he
spoke
in
good
faith
the
fact
was
that
his
aspirations
hitherto
so
vague
as
to
elude
analysis
seemed
within
the
last
few
minutes
mysteriously
to
have
assumed
definite
form
you
a
young
fool
then
but
i
an
excellent
digestion
you
wo
have
it
if
you
begin
to
write
take
my
word
you
a
young
fool
you
do
know
what
you
going
in
for
my
little
friend
was
murger
a
fool
richard
said
clumsily
determined
to
exhibit
an
acquaintance
with
la
vie
de
bohème
ha
we
read
french
do
we
richard
blushed
the
old
man
got
up
come
along
he
said
peevishly
let
get
out
of
this
hole
at
the
waiting
for
change
he
spoke
to
the
cashier
a
thin
girl
with
hair
who
coughed
did
you
try
those
lozenges
oh
yes
thanks
they
nice
beautiful
day
yes
my
word
is
it
they
walked
back
to
the
office
in
absolute
silence
but
just
as
they
were
going
in
aked
stopped
and
took
richard
by
the
coat
have
you
anything
special
to
do

richard
well

afford
richard
nodded
and
i
say
bring
along
some
of
your
manuscripts
and
i
flay
them
alive
for
you
chapter
vi
an
inconstant
unrefreshing
breeze
sluggish
with
accumulated
impurity
stirred
the
curtains
and
every
urban
sound
voices
of
children
playing
roll
of
wheels
and
rhythmic
trot
of
horses
shouts
of
newsboys
and
querulous
barking
of
dogs
came
through
the
open
windows
touched
with
a
certain
languorous
quality
that
suggested
a
city
fatigued
a
city
yearning
for
the
moist
recesses
of
woods
the
disinfectant
breath
of
mountain
tops
and
the
cleansing
sea
on
the
little
table
between
the
windows
lay
pen
ink
and
paper
richard
sat
down
to
be
an
author
since
his
conversation
with
aked
of
the
day
before
he
had
lived
in
the
full
glow
of
an
impulse
to
write
he
discerned
or
thought
he
discerned
in
the
fact
that
he
possessed
the
literary
gift
a
key
to
his
recent
life
it
explained
to
be
particular
the
passion
for
reading
which
had
overtaken
him
at
seventeen
and
his
desire
to
come
to
london
the
natural
home
of
the
author
certainly
it
was
strange
that
hitherto
he
had
devoted
very
little
serious
thought
to
the
subject
of
writing
but
happily
there
were
in
existence
sundry
stray
verses
and
prose
fragments
written
at
bursley
and
it
contented
him
to
recognise
in
these
the
first
tremulous
stirrings
of
a
ambition
during
the
previous
evening
he
had
busied
himself
in
deciding
upon
a
topic
in
a
morning
paper
he
had
read
an
article
entitled
an
island
of
sleep
descriptive
of
sark
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
similar
essay
upon
lichfield
the
comatose
cathedral
city
which
lay
about
thirty
miles
from
bursley
might
suit
a
monthly
magazine
he
knew
lichfield
well
he
had
been
accustomed
to
visit
it
from
childhood
he
loved
it
as
a
theme
full
of
picturesque
opportunities
it
had
quickened
his
imagination
until
his
brain
seemed
to
surge
with
vague
but
beautiful
fancies
in
the
night
his
sleep
had
been
broken
and
several
new
ideas
had
suggested
themselves
and
now
after
a
day
of
excited
anticipation
the
moment
for
composition
had
arrived
as
he
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
a
sudden
apprehension
of
failure
surprised
him
he
dismissed
it
and
wrote
in
a
bold
hand
rather
carefully
memories
of
a
city
of
sleep
that
was
surely
an
excellent
title
he
proceeded
the
old
stone
bridge
beneath
which
the
clear
smooth
waters
of
the
river
have
crept
at
the
same
pace
for
centuries
stands
a
little
child
alone
it
is
early
morning
and
the
clock
of
the
cathedral
which
lifts
its
noble
gothic
towers
scarce
a
hundred
yards
away
strikes
five
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
unseen
lark
he
sat
back
to
excogitate
the
next
sentence
staring
around
the
room
as
if
he
expected
to
find
the
words
written
on
the
wall
one
of
the
photographs
was
slightly
askew
he
left
his
chair
to
put
it
straight
several
other
pictures
seemed
to
need
adjustment
and
he
levelled
them
all
with
scrupulous
precision
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
were
not
evenly
balanced
these
he
rearranged
entirely
then
having
first
smoothed
out
a
crease
in
the
bedcover
he
sat
down
again
but
most
of
the
beautiful
ideas
which
he
had
persuaded
himself
were
firmly
within
his
grasp
now
eluded
him
or
tardily
presented
themselves
in
a
form
so
obscure
as
to
be
valueless
and
the
useful
few
that
remained
defied
all
attempts
to
bring
them
into
order
dashed
by
his
own
impotence
he
sought
out
the
article
on
sark
and
examined
it
afresh
certain
weekly
organs
of
literature
had
educated
him
to
sneer
at
the
journalism
of
the
daily
press
but
it
appeared
that
the
man
who
wrote
an
island
of
sleep
was
at
least
capable
of
expressing
himself
with
clearness
and
fluency
and
possessed
the
skill
to
pass
naturally
from
one
aspect
of
his
subject
to
another
it
seemed
simple
enough
he
went
to
the
window
the
sky
was
a
delicate
amber
and
richard
watched
it
change
to
rose
and
from
rose
to
light
blue
the
glared
out
in
quick
succession
some
one
lowered
the
blind
of
a
window
opposite
his
own
and
presently
a
woman
profile
was
silhouetted
against
it
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
a
melody
came
from
the
public
house
sung
in
a
raucous
baritone
to
the
thrumming
of
a
guitar
the
cries
of
the
playing
children
had
now
ceased
suddenly
turning
into
the
room
he
was
astonished
to
find
it
almost
in
darkness
he
could
distinguish
only
the
whiteness
of
the
papers
on
the
table
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
writing
some
men
wrote
best
in
the
evening
others
in
the
morning
probably
he
belonged
to
the
latter
class
be
that
as
it
might
he
would
rise
at
six
the
next
morning
and
make
a
new
beginning
it
only
a
question
of
practice
of
course
he
said
half
aloud
repressing
a
troublesome
dubiety
he
would
take
a
short
walk
and
go
early
to
bed
gradually
his
returned
as
he
closed
the
front
door
there
was
a
rustle
of
silks
and
a
transient
odour
of
violets
a
woman
had
gone
by
she
turned
slightly
at
the
sound
of
the
door
and
richard
had
a
glimpse
of
a
young
and
pretty
face
under
a
spreading
hat
a
full
ripe
bust
whose
alluring
contours
were
perfectly
disclosed
by
a
bodice
and
two
small
white
hands
in
one
a
dangling
pair
of
gloves
in
the
other
an
umbrella
he
passed
her
and
waited
at
the
corner
by
tattersall
till
she
overtook
him
again
now
she
stood
on
the
kerb
within
six
feet
of
him
humming
an
air
and
smiling
to
herself
up
went
the
umbrella
to
signal
for
a
hansom
the
ottoman
richard
heard
her
say
across
the
roof
of
the
cab
the
driver
leaning
forward
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
what
a
child
voice
it
seemed
lisping
and
artless
the
cabman
winked
at
richard
and
gently
flicked
his
horse
in
a
moment
the
hansom
was
two
dwindling
specks
of
red
in
a
shifting
multitude
of
lights
an
hour
later
he
saw
her
in
the
promenade
of
the
theatre
she
stood
against
a
pillar
her
eyes
on
the
entrance
as
their
glances
met
she
threw
her
head
a
little
backwards
like
one
who
looks
through
spectacles
on
the
end
of
his
nose
and
showed
her
teeth
he
sat
down
near
her
presently
she
waved
her
hand
to
a
man
who
was
coming
in
he
seemed
about
thirty
with
small
clear
eyes
bronzed
cheeks
a
heavy
jaw
and
a
closely
trimmed
brown
moustache
he
was
fashionably
garbed
though
not
in
evening
dress
and
he
greeted
her
without
raising
his
hat
shall
we
have
a
drink
she
suggested
i
so
thirsty
fizz
the
man
drawled
she
nodded
soon
they
went
out
together
the
man
carelessly
stuffing
change
for
a
note
into
his
pocket
what
the
difference
between
him
and
me
richard
reflected
as
he
walked
home
but
just
wait
a
bit
wait
till
i
when
he
reached
his
lodging
the
meanness
of
the
room
of
his
clothes
of
his
supper
nauseated
him
he
dreamed
that
he
was
kissing
the
ottoman
girl
and
that
she
lisped
nice
boy
whereupon
he
cast
a
handful
of
sovereigns
on
her
lap
at
six
the
next
morning
he
was
working
at
his
article
in
two
days
it
was
finished
and
he
had
despatched
it
to
a
monthly
magazine
together
with
a
stamped
directed
envelope
for
its
return
if
unsuitable
in
accordance
with
the
editorial
instructions
printed
below
the
table
of
contents
in
every
number
the
editor
of
the
trifler
promised
that
all
manuscripts
so
submitted
and
written
on
one
side
of
the
paper
only
should
be
dealt
with
promptly
he
had
been
expecting
to
discuss
his
work
with
aked
at
the
proposed
dinner
but
this
had
not
taken
place
on
the
morning
after
the
arrangement
had
been
made
aked
fell
ill
and
in
a
few
days
he
wrote
to
resign
his
post
saying
that
he
had
sufficient
to
live
on
and
felt
too
venerable
for
regular
work
richard
held
but
the
frailest
hope
that
a
city
of
sleep
would
be
accepted
but
when
the
third
morning
arrived
and
the
postman
brought
nothing
his
opinion
of
the
article
began
to
rise
perhaps
it
had
merit
after
all
he
recalled
certain
parts
of
it
which
were
distinctly
clever
and
striking
hurrying
home
from
the
office
that
afternoon
he
met
the
landlady
daughter
on
the
stairs
and
said
casually
any
letters
for
me
lily
no
sir
the
girl
had
an
attractive
blush
i
take
a
couple
of
eggs
for
tea
if
rowbotham
has
them
he
remained
at
home
in
the
evening
waiting
for
the
last
delivery
which
occurred
about
the
double
knocks
of
the
postman
were
audible
ten
or
twelve
houses
away
at
last
richard
heard
him
mounting
the
steps
of
no
and
then
his
curt
shook
the
house
a
little
thud
on
the
bare
wooden
floor
of
the
hall
seemed
to
indicate
a
heavier
package
than
the
ordinary
letter
as
when
a
man
is
drowning
the
bad
actions
of
a
whole
lifetime
present
themselves
to
him
in
one
awful
flash
so
at
that
moment
all
the
faults
the
hopeless
crudities
of
a
city
of
sleep
confronted
richard
he
wondered
at
his
own
fatuity
in
imagining
for
a
single
instant
that
the
article
had
the
barest
chance
of
acceptance
was
it
not
notorious
that
famous
authors
had
written
industriously
for
years
without
selling
a
line
lily
came
in
with
the
she
was
smiling
warm
work
eh
lily
he
said
scarcely
knowing
that
he
spoke
yes
sir
it
that
hot
in
the
kitchen
you
would
believe
setting
down
the
tray
she
handed
him
a
foolscap
envelope
and
he
saw
his
own
handwriting
as
if
in
a
dream
for
me
he
murmured
carelessly
and
placed
the
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
lily
took
his
orders
for
breakfast
and
with
a
pleasant
timid
sir
left
the
room
he
opened
the
envelope
in
the
fold
of
his
manuscript
was
a
sheet
of
the
best
bearing
these
words
in
flowing
copperplate
the
editor
presents
his
compliments
to
larch
written
and
regrets
to
be
unable
to
use
the
enclosed
article
for
the
offer
of
which
he
is
much
obliged
the
sight
of
this
circular
with
the
offices
of
the
magazine
illustrated
at
the
top
and
the
notification
in
the
corner
that
all
letters
must
be
addressed
to
the
editor
and
not
to
any
member
of
the
staff
individually
in
some
mysterious
way
mitigated
disappointment
perhaps
the
comfort
of
it
lay
in
the
tangible
assurance
it
afforded
that
he
was
now
actually
literary
and
had
communications
however
mortifying
with
he
read
the
circular
again
and
again
during
supper
and
determined
to
the
article
but
this
resolve
was
not
carried
out
he
could
not
bring
himself
even
to
glance
through
it
and
finally
it
was
sent
to
another
magazine
exactly
as
it
stood
richard
had
determined
to
say
nothing
in
the
office
about
his
writing
until
he
could
produce
a
printed
article
with
his
name
at
the
foot
and
frequently
during
the
last
few
days
his
mouth
had
watered
as
he
anticipated
the
sweetness
of
that
triumph
but
next
day
he
could
not
refrain
from
showing
to
jenkins
the
note
from
the
trifler
jenkins
seemed
impressed
especially
when
richard
requested
him
to
treat
the
matter
as
confidential
a
sort
of
friendship
arose
between
them
and
strengthened
as
time
went
on
richard
sometimes
wondered
how
precisely
it
had
come
about
and
why
it
continued

years
of
age
and
lived
with
his
parents
and
seven
brothers
and
sisters
in
camberwell
his
father
managed
a
refreshment
bar
in
oxford
street
he
had
been
in
the
employ
of
curpet
and
smythe
for
seven
years
first
as
junior
office
boy
then
as
senior
office
boy
and
finally
as
junior
shorthand
clerk
he
was
of
the
average
height
with
a
shallow
chest
and
thin
arms
and
legs
his
feet
were
very
small
he
often
referred
to
the
fact
with
frank
complacency
and
were
always
encased
in
boots
brightly
polished
the
rest
of
his
attire
was
less
remarkable
for
neatness
but
at
intervals
an
ambition
to
be
genteel
possessed
him
and
during
these
recurrent
periods
the
nice
conduct
of
his
fingernails
interfered
somewhat
with
official
routine
he
carried
his
hat
either
at
the
back
of
his
head
or
tilted
almost
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
in
the
streets
he
generally
walked
with
sedate
deliberation
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
lowered
and
an
enigmatic
smile
on
his
thin
lips
his
countenance
was
of
a
pale
yellow
complexion
just
tinged
with
red
and
he
never
coloured
his
neck
was
a
darker
yellow
upon
the
whole
his
features
were
regular
except
the
mouth
which
was
large
and
protruded
like
a
monkey
the
eyes
were
grey
with
a
bold
regard
which
not
seldom
was
excusably
mistaken
for
insolence
considering
his
years
jenkins
was
a
highly
accomplished
person
in
certain
directions
upon
all
matters
connected
with
her
majesty
mail
and
inland
revenue
upon
cab
fares
and
local
railways
upon
pitman
outlines
and
upon
chamber
practice
in
chancery
he
was
an
unquestioned
authority
he
knew
the
addresses
of
several
hundred
london
solicitors
the
locality
of
nearly
every
street
and
square
within
the
radius
and
within
the
same
limits
the
approximate
distance
of
any
one
given
spot
from
any
other
given
spot
he
was
the
best
in
the
office
and
had
once
made
a
break
of
this
game
was
his
sole
pastime
he
gambled
regularly
upon
resorting
to
a
number
of
bookmakers
but
neither
winning
nor
losing
to
an
appreciable
extent
no
less
than
three
jockeys
occasionally
permitted
him
to
enjoy
their
companionship
and
he
was
never
without
a
his
particular
hobby
however
was
restaurants
he
spent
half
his
income
upon
food
and
quite
half
his
waking
hours
either
in
deciding
what
he
should
consume
or
in
actual
drinking
and
mastication
he
had
personally
tested
the
merits
of
every
bar
and
house
of
refreshment
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
law
courts
from
lockhart
to
gatti
and
would
discourse
for
hours
on
their
respective
virtues
and
defects
no
restaurant
was
too
mean
for
his
patronage
and
none
too
splendid
for
days
in
succession
he
would
dine
upon
a
glass
of
water
and
a
captain
biscuit
with
cheese
in
order
to
accumulate
resources
for
a
delicate
repast
in
one
of
the
gilded
establishments
where
the
rich
are
wont
to
sustain
themselves
and
he
had
acquired
from
his
father
a
quantity
of
curious
lore
throwing
light
upon
the
secrets
of
the
refreshment
trade
which
enabled
him
to
spend
the
money
thus
painfully
amassed
to
the
best
advantage
jenkins
was
a
cockney
and
the
descendant
of
cockneys
he
conversed
always
volubly
in
the
dialect
of
camberwell
but
just
as
he
was
subject
to
attacks
of
modishness
so
at
times
he
attempted
to
rid
himself
of
his
accent
of
course
without
success
he
swore
habitually
and
used
no
reticence
whatever
except
in
the
presence
of
his
employers
and
of
alder
the
manager
in
quick
and
effective
retort
he
was
the
peer
of
cabmen
and
nothing
could
abash
him
his
favourite
subjects
of
discussion
were
restaurants
as
before
mentioned
billiards
the
turf
and
women
whom
he
usually
described
as
tarts
it
was
his
custom
to
refer
to
himself
as
a
devil
for
girls
and
when
alder
playfully
accused
him
of
adventures
with
females
of
easy
virtue
his
delight
was
unbounded
there
were
moments
when
richard
loathed
jenkins
when
the
gross
and
ribald
atmosphere
which
attended
jenkins
presence
nauseated
him
and
utter
solitude
in
london
seemed
preferable
to
the
boy
company
but
these
passed
and
the
intimacy
throve
jenkins
indeed
had
his
graces
he
was
of
an
exceedingly
generous
nature
and
his
admiration
for
the
deep
literary
scholarship
which
he
imagined
richard
to
possess
was
ingenuous
and
unconcealed
his
own
agile
wit
his
picturesque
use
of
slang
his
facility
in
new
oaths
and
above
all
his
exact
knowledge
of
the
byways
and
backwaters
of
london
life
endowed
him
in
unaccustomed
eyes
with
a
certain
specious
attractiveness
moreover
the
fact
that
they
shared
the
same
room
and
performed
similar
duties
made
familiar
intercourse
between
them
natural
and
necessary
with
no
other
member
of
the
staff
did
richard
care
to
associate
the
articled
clerks
though
courteously
agreeable
to
everyone
formed
an
exclusive
coterie
and
as
for
the
rest
they
were
either
old
or
dull
or
both
he
often
debated
whether
he
should
seek
out
aked
who
was
now
recovered
and
had
once
unfortunately
in
richard
absence
called
at
the
office
but
at
length
he
timidly
decided
that
the
extent
of
their
acquaintance
would
not
warrant
it
where
shall
we
go
to
lunch
was
almost
the
first
question
which
richard
and
jenkins
asked
each
other
in
the
morning
and
a
prolonged
discussion
would
follow
they
called
the
meal
lunch
but
it
was
really
their
dinner
though
neither
of
them
ever
admitted
the
fact
jenkins
had
a
predilection
for
where
raw
chops
and
steaks
lay
on
huge
dishes
and
each
customer
chose
his
own
meat
and
superintended
its
cooking
a
steak
tender
and
perfectly
cooked
with
baked
potatoes
and
half
a
pint
of
stout
was
his
ideal
repast
and
he
continually
lamented
that
no
restaurant
in
london
offered
such
cheer
at
the
price
of
one
shilling
and
threepence
including
the
waiter
the
cheap
establishments
were
never
satisfactory
and
jenkins
only
frequented
them
when
the
state
of
his
purse
left
no
alternative
in
company
with
richard
he
visited
every
new
that
made
its
appearance
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
restaurant
of
his
dreams
and
though
each
was
a
disappointment
yet
the
search
still
went
on
the
place
which
most
nearly
coincided
with
his
desires
was
the
sceptre
a
low
sombre
room
between
the
law
courts
and
the
river
used
by
managing
clerks
and
a
sprinkling
of
junior
barristers
here
lounging
luxuriously
on
red
plush
seats
and
in
full
sight
and
hearing
of
a
large
silver
grill
the
two
spent
many
luncheon
hours
eating
slowly
with
gross
sensual
enjoyment
and
secretly
elated
by
the
proximity
of
men
older
and
more
prosperous
than
themselves
whom
they
met
on
equal
terms
richard
once
suggested
that
they
should
try
one
of
the
french
restaurants
in
soho
which
aked
had
mentioned
not
me
said
jenkins
in
reply
you
do
catch
me
going
to
those
shops
again
i
went
once
they
give
you
a
lot
of
little
messes
faked
up
from
yesterday
dirty
plates
and
after
you
eaten
half
a
dozen
of
you
do
feel
a
bit
fuller
give
me
a
steak
and
a
potato
i
like
to
know
what
i
eating
he
had
an
equal
detestation
of
vegetarian
restaurants
but
once
during
a
period
of
financial
depression
he
agreed
to
accompany
richard
who
knew
the
place
fairly
well
to
the
crabtree
in
charing
cross
road
and
though
he
grumbled
roundly
at
the
insubstantiality
of
the
dinner
la
which
could
be
obtained
for
sixpence
he
made
no
difficulty
afterwards
about
dining
there
whenever
prudence
demanded
the
narrowest
economy
an
air
of
chill
and
prim
discomfort
pervaded
the
crabtree
and
the
mingled
odour
of
lentils
and
sultana
pudding
filled
every
corner
the
tables
were
narrow
and
the
chairs
unyielding
the
customers
were
for
the
most
eccentric
as
to
dress
and
demeanour
they
had
pale
faces
and
during
their
melancholy
meals
perused
volumes
obviously
instructive
or
debated
the
topics
of
the
day
in
platitudinous
conversations
unspiced
by
a
single
oath
young
women
with
whom
their
personal
appearance
was
a
negligible
quantity
came
in
large
numbers
and
either
giggled
to
one
another
without
restraint
or
sat
erect
and
glared
at
the
males
in
a
manner
which
cowed
even
jenkins
the
waitresses
lacked
understanding
and
seemed
to
resent
even
the
most
courteous
advances
one
day
just
as
they
were
beginning
dinner
jenkins
eagerly
drew
richard
attention
to
the
girl
at
the
see
that
girl
he
said
what
about
her
is
she
a
new
one
why
she
the
tart
that
old
aked
used
to
be
after
was
she
at
that
a
shop
in
the
strand
said
richard
who
began
to
remember
the
girl
features
and
her
reddish
brown
hair
yes
that
her
before
she
was
at
the
a
she
was
cashier
at
that
place
opposite
the
courts
but
they
say
she
got
the
sack
for
talking
to
customers
too
much
she
and
aked
were
very
thick
then
and
he
went
there
every
day
i
suppose
his
courting
interfered
with
business
but
he
old
enough
to
be
her
father
yes
he
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
himself
she
not
a
bad
kind
eh
there
was
anything
between
them
really
was
there
do
know
there
might
have
been
he
followed
her
to
the
a
b
c
and
i
think
he
sometimes
took
her
home
her
name
roberts
we
used
to
have
him
on
about
her
rare
fun
the
story
annoyed
richard
for
his
short
with
aked
had
remained
in
his
mind
as
a
pleasant
memory
and
though
he
was
aware
that
the
old
man
had
been
treated
with
scant
respect
by
the
youngsters
in
the
office
he
had
acquired
the
habit
of
mentally
regarding
him
with
admiration
as
a
representative
of
literature
this
attachment
to
a
restaurant
cashier
clearly
a
person
of
no
refinement
or
intellect
scarcely
fitted
with
his
estimate
of
the
journalist
who
had
spoken
to
carlyle
during
the
meal
he
surreptitiously
glanced
at
the
girl
several
times
she
was
plumper
than
before
and
her
cough
seemed
to
be
cured
her
face
was
pleasant
and
undoubtedly
she
had
a
magnificent
coiffure
when
they
presented
their
checks
jenkins
bowed
awkwardly
and
she
smiled
he
swore
to
richard
that
next
time
he
would
mention
aked
name
to
her
the
vow
was
broken
she
was
willing
to
exchange
civilities
but
her
manner
indicated
with
sufficient
clearness
that
a
line
was
to
be
drawn
in
the
following
week
when
richard
happened
to
be
at
the
crabtree
alone
at
a
later
hour
than
usual
they
had
rather
a
long
conversation
is
aked
still
at
your
office
she
asked
looking
down
at
her
account
books
richard
told
what
he
knew
oh
she
said
i
often
used
to
see
him
and
he
gave
me
some
lozenges
that
cured
a
bad
cough
i
had
nice
old
fellow
was
he
yes
i
fancy
so
richard
assented
i
thought
i
just
ask
as
i
had
seen
him
about
for
a
long
time
good
afternoon
miss
roberts
good
afternoon
larch
they
both
laughed
a
trivial
dispute
with
jenkins
a
few
days
later
disclosed
the
fact
that
that
haunter
of
bars
had
a
sullen
temper
and
that
his
displeasure
once
aroused
was
slow
to
disappear
richard
dined
alone
again
at
the
crabtree
and
after
another
little
conversation
with
miss
roberts
having
time
at
his
disposal
he
called
at
the
public
library
in
martin
lane
in
a
review
he
saw
an
article
by
a
writer
of
considerable
repute
entitled
to
literary
aspirants
which
purported
to
demonstrate
that
a
mastery
of
the
craft
of
words
was
only
to
be
attained
by
a
regular
course
of
technical
exercises
the
nature
of
these
exercises
was
described
in
detail
there
were
references
to
the
unremitting
drudgery
of
flaubert
de
maupassant
and
stevenson
together
with
extracts
chosen
to
illustrate
the
slow
passage
of
the
author
from
inspired
incompetence
to
the
serene
and
perfect
proficiency
before
which
all
difficulties
melted
after
an
unqualified
statement
that
any
man
slowly
if
without
talent
quickly
if
gifted
by
nature
might
with
determined
application
learn
to
write
finely
the
essayist
concluded
by
remarking
that
never
before
in
the
history
of
literature
had
young
authors
been
so
favourably
circumstanced
as
at
that
present
lastly
came
the
maxim
dies
sine
richard
cooling
enthusiasm
for
letters
leaped
into
flame
he
had
done
no
writing
whatever
for
several
weeks
but
that
night
saw
him
desperately
at
work
he
took
advantage
of
the
quarrel
to
sever
all
save
the
most
formal
connection
with
jenkins
dined
always
frugally
at
the
crabtree
and
spent
every
evening
at
his
lodging
the
thought
of
alphonse
daudet
writing
les
amoureuses
in
a
parisian
garret
supported
him
through
an
entire
month
of
toil
during
which
besides
assiduously
practising
the
recommended
exercises
he
wrote
a
complete
short
story
and
began
several
essays
about
this
time
his
city
of
sleep
was
returned
upon
his
hands
in
a
condition
so
filthy
and
ragged
that
he
was
moved
to
burn
it
the
short
story
was
offered
to
an
evening
daily
and
never
heard
of
again
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
he
possessed
some
talent
for
dramatic
criticism
and
one
saturday
evening
he
went
to
the
first
performance
of
a
play
at
the
george
theatre
after
waiting
for
an
hour
outside
he
got
a
seat
in
the
last
row
of
the
pit
eagerly
he
watched
the
critics
take
their
places
in
the
stalls
they
chatted
languidly
smiling
and
bowing
now
and
then
to
acquaintances
in
the
boxes
and
dress
circle
the
pit
was
excited
and
loquacious
and
richard
discovered
that
nearly
everyone
round
about
him
made
a
practice
of
attending
first
nights
and
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
of
the
stage
through
the
hum
of
voices
the
overture
to
rosamund
fitfully
reached
him
during
whole
bars
the
music
was
lost
then
some
salient
note
caught
the
ear
and
the
melody
became
audible
again
until
another
wave
of
conversation
engulfed
it
the
conclusion
of
the
last
act
was
greeted
with
frenzied
beating
of
sticks
and
inarticulate
cries
while
above
the
general
noise
was
heard
the
repeated
monosyllable
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
delay
the
curtain
was
drawn
back
at
one
side
and
a
tall
man
in
evening
dress
his
face
a
dead
white
stepped
before
the
footlights
and
bowed
several
times
the
noise
rose
to
a
thunderous
roar
in
which
howls
and
hissing
were
distinguishable
richard
shook
from
head
to
foot
and
tears
unaccountably
came
to
his
eyes
the
whole
of
sunday
and
monday
evening
were
occupied
in
writing
a
detailed
analysis
and
appreciation
of
the
play
on
tuesday
morning
he
bought
a
weekly
paper
which
devoted
special
attention
to
the
drama
in
order
to
compare
his
own
view
with
that
of
an
acknowledged
authority
and
found
that
the
production
was
dismissed
in
ten
curt
lines
as
mere
amiable
drivel
a
few
days
afterwards
curpet
offered
him
the
position
of
cashier
in
the
office
at
a
salary
of
three
pounds
a
week
his
income
was
exactly
doubled
and
the
disappointments
of
unsuccessful
authorship
suddenly
ceased
to
trouble
him
he
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
making
any
further
attempt
towards
literature
was
it
not
clear
that
his
talents
lay
in
the
direction
of
business
nevertheless
a
large
part
of
his
spare
cash
was
devoted
to
the
purchase
of
books
chiefly
the
productions
of
a
few
celebrated
old
continental
presses
which
he
had
recently
learned
to
value
he
prepared
a
scheme
for
educating
himself
in
the
classical
tongues
and
in
french
and
the
practice
of
writing
was
abandoned
to
make
opportunity
for
the
pursuit
of
culture
but
culture
proved
to
be
shy
and
elusive
he
adhered
to
no
regular
course
of
study
and
though
he
read
much
his
progress
towards
knowledge
was
almost
imperceptible
other
distractions
presented
themselves
in
the
shape
of
music
and
painting
he
discovered
that
he
was
not
without
critical
taste
in
both
these
arts
and
he
became
a
frequenter
of
concerts
and
he
bought
a
piano
on
the
system
and
took
lessons
thereon
in
this
and
other
ways
his
expenditure
swelled
till
it
more
than
swallowed
up
the
income
of
three
pounds
a
week
which
not
long
before
he
had
regarded
as
something
very
like
wealth
for
many
weeks
he
made
no
effort
to
adjust
the
balance
until
his
debts
approached
the
sum
of
twenty
pounds
nearly
half
of
which
was
owing
to
his
landlady
he
had
to
go
through
more
than
one
humiliating
scene
before
an
era
of
economy
set
in
one
afternoon
he
received
a
telegram
to
say
that
william
vernon
had
died
very
suddenly
it
was
signed
alice
clayton
vernon
vernon
was
william
stately
and
richard
to
whom
she
had
spoken
only
once
soon
after
mary
wedding
regarded
her
with
awe
he
disliked
her
because
he
found
it
impossible
to
be
at
ease
in
her
imposing
presence
as
he
went
into
curpet
room
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
his
one
feeling
was
annoyance
at
the
prospect
of
having
to
meet
her
again
william
death
to
his
own
astonishment
scarcely
affected
him
at
all
curpet
readily
granted
him
two
days
holiday
and
he
arranged
to
go
down
to
bursley
the
following
night
for
the
funeral
chapter
viii
wearied
of
sitting
richard
folded
his
overcoat
put
it
under
his
head
and
extended
himself
on
the
polished
yellow
wood
but
in
vain
were
his
eyes
shut
tight
sleep
would
not
come
though
he
yawned
incessantly
the
monstrous
beat
of
the
engine
the
quick
rattle
of
windows
and
the
grinding
of
wheels
were
fused
into
a
fantastic
resonance
which
occupied
every
corner
of
the
carriage
and
invaded
his
very
skull
then
a
light
tapping
on
the
roof
one
of
those
mysterious
sounds
which
make
a
compartment
in
a
like
a
haunted
room
momentarily
silenced
everything
else
and
he
wished
that
he
had
not
been
alone
suddenly
jumping
up
he
put
away
all
idea
of
sleep
and
lowered
the
window
it
was
pitch
dark
vague
changing
shapes
which
might
have
been
either
trees
or
mere
fancies
of
the
groping
eye
outlined
themselves
a
short
distance
away
far
in
front
was
a
dull
glare
from
the
engine
and
behind
twinkled
the
guard
lamp
in
a
few
seconds
he
closed
the
window
again
chilled
to
the
bone
though
may
was
nearly
at
an
end
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
now
a
solitary
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
it
concerned
no
living
person
whether
he
did
evil
or
good
if
he
chose
to
seek
ruin
to
abandon
himself
to
the
most
ignoble
impulses
there
was
none
to
restrain
not
even
a
for
several
weeks
past
he
had
been
troubled
about
his
future
afraid
to
face
it
certainly
london
satisfied
him
and
the
charm
of
living
there
had
not
perceptibly
grown
less
he
rejoiced
in
london
in
its
vistas
its
shops
its
unending
crowds
its
vastness
its
wickedness
each
dream
dreamed
about
london
in
childhood
had
come
true
and
surer
than
ever
before
was
the
consciousness
that
in
going
to
london
he
had
fulfilled
his
destiny
yet
there
was
something
to
lack
in
himself
his
confidence
in
his
own
abilities
and
his
own
character
was
being
undermined
nearly
a
year
had
gone
and
he
had
made
no
progress
except
at
the
office
resolutions
were
constantly
broken
it
was
three
months
since
he
had
despatched
an
article
to
a
newspaper
he
had
not
even
followed
a
definite
course
of
study
and
though
his
acquaintance
with
modern
french
fiction
had
widened
he
could
boast
no
exact
scholarship
even
in
that
piquant
field
evening
after
evening
ah
those
long
lamplit
evenings
which
were
to
be
given
to
strenuous
effort
was
frittered
away
upon
mean
banalities
sometimes
in
the
company
of
some
casual
acquaintance
and
sometimes
alone
he
had
by
no
means
grasped
the
full
import
and
extent
of
this
retrogression
it
was
merely
beginning
to
disturb
his
and
perhaps
ever
so
slightly
his
sleep
but
now
hurrying
to
the
funeral
of
william
vernon
he
lazily
laughed
at
himself
for
having
allowed
his
peace
of
mind
to
be
ruffled
why
bother
about
getting
on
what
did
it
matter
he
still
experienced
but
little
sorrow
at
the
death
of
vernon
his
affection
for
the
man
had
strangely
faded
during
the
nine
months
that
he
had
lived
in
london
they
had
scarcely
written
to
one
another
and
richard
regarded
the
long
journey
to
attend
william
obsequies
as
a
tiresome
concession
to
propriety
that
was
his
real
attitude
had
he
cared
to
examine
it
at
about
four
it
was
quite
light
and
the
risen
sun
woke
richard
from
a
brief
doze
the
dew
lay
in
the
hollows
of
the
fields
but
elsewhere
there
was
a
soft
fresh
clearness
which
gave
to
the
common
incidents
of
the
flying
landscape
a
new
and
virginal
beauty
as
though
that
had
been
the
morn
of
creation
itself
the
cattle
were
stirring
and
turned
to
watch
the
train
as
it
slipped
by
richard
opened
the
window
again
his
mood
had
changed
and
he
felt
unreasonably
joyous
last
night
he
had
been
too
pessimistic
life
lay
yet
before
him
and
time
enough
to
rectify
any
indiscretions
of
which
he
might
have
been
guilty
the
future
was
his
to
use
as
he
liked
magnificent
consoling
thought
moved
by
some
symbolic
association
of
ideas
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
peered
in
the
direction
of
the
train
motion
a
cottage
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
innumerable
meadows
as
it
crossed
his
vision
the
door
opened
and
a
young
woman
came
out
with
an
empty
pail
swinging
in
her
left
hand
apparently
she
would
be
about
plump
and
sturdy
and
straight
her
hair
was
loose
about
her
round
contented
face
and
with
her
disengaged
hand
she
rubbed
her
eyes
still
puffed
and
heavy
with
sleep
she
wore
a
pink
print
gown
the
bodice
of
which
was
unfastened
disclosing
a
white
undergarment
and
the
rich
hemispheres
of
her
bosom
in
an
instant
the
scene
was
hidden
by
a
curve
of
the
line
and
the
interminable
succession
of
fields
resumed
but
richard
had
time
to
guess
from
her
figure
that
the
woman
was
the
mother
of
a
small
family
he
pictured
her
husband
still
unconscious
in
the
warm
bed
which
she
had
just
left
he
even
saw
the
impress
of
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
a
long
nightdress
thrown
hastily
across
a
chair
he
was
deeply
and
indescribably
affected
by
this
suggestion
of
peaceful
married
love
set
in
so
great
a
solitude
the
woman
and
her
hypothetical
husband
and
children
were
only
peasants
their
lives
were
probably
narrow
and
their
intellects
dormant
yet
they
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
of
envy
which
surged
about
his
brain
and
for
the
moment
asphyxiated
thought
later
on
the
train
slackened
speed
as
it
passed
through
a
the
steam
from
the
light
rose
with
delicacy
in
the
clear
air
and
an
occasional
short
whistle
seemed
to
have
something
of
the
quality
of
a
bird
note
the
men
with
their
long
poles
moved
blithely
among
the
medley
of
rails
signalling
one
another
with
motions
of
the
arm
the
rang
with
a
merry
giant
tinkle
and
when
the
engine
brought
its
load
of
waggons
to
a
standstill
and
a
smart
metallic
bump
bump
bump
ran
from
waggon
to
waggon
one
might
have
fancied
that
some
leviathan
game
was
being
played
richard
forgot
the
girl
with
the
pail
and
soon
after
went
to
sleep
at
six
the
train
reached
knype
where
he
had
to
change
two
women
with
several
children
also
alighted
and
he
noticed
how
white
and
fatigued
were
their
faces
the
children
yawned
pitifully
an
icy
searching
wind
blew
through
the
station
the
exhilaration
of
the
dawn
was
gone
and
a
spirit
of
utter
woe
and
disaster
brooded
over
everything
for
the
first
time
william
death
really
touched
him
the
streets
of
bursley
were
nearly
empty
as
he
walked
through
the
town
from
the
railway
station
for
the
industrial
population
was
already
at
work
in
the
manufactories
and
the
shops
not
yet
open
yet
richard
avoided
the
main
thoroughfares
choosing
a
circuitous
route
lest
he
might
by
chance
encounter
an
acquaintance
he
foresaw
the
inevitable
banal
dialogue
well
how
do
you
like
london
oh
it
fine
getting
on
all
right
yes
thanks
and
then
the
effort
of
two
secretly
bored
persons
to
continue
a
perfunctory
conversation
unaided
by
a
single
mutual
interest
a
carriage
was
driving
away
from
the
red
house
just
as
richard
got
within
sight
of
it
he
nodded
to
the
venerable
coachman
who
gravely
touched
his
hat
the
owner
of
the
carriage
was
clayton
vernon
william
cousin
and
an
alderman
of
bursley
and
richard
surmised
that
clayton
vernon
had
put
herself
in
charge
of
the
place
until
the
funeral
should
be
over
he
trembled
at
the
prospect
of
a
whole
day
to
be
spent
in
the
company
of
these
excellent
people
whom
william
had
always
referred
to
with
a
smile
and
yet
not
without
a
great
deal
of
respect
the
clayton
vernons
were
the
chief
buttress
of
respectability
in
the
town
rich
strictly
religious
philanthropic
and
above
all
dignified
everyone
looked
up
to
them
instinctively
and
had
they
possessed
but
one
vice
between
them
they
would
have
been
loved
clayton
vernon
herself
opened
the
door
she
was
a
stately
woman
of
advanced
middle
age
with
a
suave
imperious
manner
i
left
clayton
to
have
breakfast
by
himself
she
said
as
she
led
richard
into
the
i
thought
you
would
like
someone
here
to
welcome
you
after
your
long
night
journey
breakfast
will
be
ready
almost
directly
how
tired
you
must
be
clayton
said
it
was
a
pity
you
should
come
by
the
night
train
but
of
course
it
is
quite
right
that
you
should
inconvenience
your
employers
as
little
as
possible
quite
right
and
we
admire
you
for
it
now
will
you
run
upstairs
and
wash
you
not
forgotten
the
way
the
details
of
the
funeral
had
been
settled
by
clayton
vernon
who
was
the
chief
mourner
and
richard
had
nothing
to
do
but
fall
in
with
preconcerted
plans
and
answer
decorously
when
spoken
to
the
arrangement
was
satisfactory
in
that
it
relieved
him
from
duties
which
would
have
been
irksome
but
scarcely
gratifying
to
his
pride
he
had
lived
nearly
all
his
life
in
that
house
and
had
known
the
dead
man
perhaps
more
intimately
than
anyone
else
present
however
he
found
it
convenient
to
efface
himself
in
the
evening
there
was
an
elaborate
tea
at
which
were
present
the
clayton
vernons
and
the
minister
who
had
conducted
the
funeral
service
the
minister
and
the
alderman
left
immediately
afterwards
to
attend
a
meeting
and
when
they
were
gone
clayton
vernon
said
now
we
are
all
alone
richard
go
into
the
and
i
will
follow
i
do
want
to
have
a
chat
with
you
she
came
in
with
needle
and
thread
and
scissors
if
you
will
take
off
your
coat
i
will
stitch
on
that
button
that
is
hanging
by
one
thread
i
noticed
it
this
morning
and
then
it
went
quite
out
of
my
mind
i
am
so
sorry
oh
thanks
he
blushed
hotly
but
i
can
stitch
myself
you
know
come
you
need
be
shy
of
an
old
woman
seeing
you
in
your
do
as
i
ask
he
doffed
the
coat
i
always
like
young
men
to
be
immaculately
neat
she
said
cutting
off
a
piece
of
cotton
one
personal
character
is
an
index
to
character
do
you
think
of
course
you
do
here
thread
the
needle
for
me
i
am
afraid
since
your
dear
sister
died
you
have
grown
a
little
careless
eh
she
was
particular
ah
what
a
mother
she
was
to
you
yes
said
richard
i
was
very
grieved
to
see
you
go
to
the
funeral
in
a
soft
hat
richard
really
i
was
it
was
respectful
to
your
memory
i
never
thought
you
see
i
started
in
rather
a
hurry
the
fact
was
that
he
had
no
silk
hat
nor
could
he
easily
afford
to
buy
one
but
you
think
my
dear
boy
even
clayton
was
shocked
are
those
your
best
clothes
richard
answered
that
they
were
he
sheepishly
protested
that
he
never
bothered
about
clothes
there
was
a
silence
broken
by
her
regular
stitching
at
last
she
handed
him
the
coat
and
helped
him
to
put
it
on
he
went
to
the
old
green
sofa
and
somewhat
to
his
dismay
she
sat
down
by
his
side
richard
she
began
in
a
changed
soft
voice
and
not
without
emotion
do
you
know
we
are
expecting
great
things
from
you
but
you
should
i
a
very
ordinary
sort
of
person
no
no
that
you
are
not
god
has
given
you
great
talents
and
you
must
use
them
poor
william
always
used
to
say
that
you
were
highly
gifted
and
might
do
great
things
might
yes
if
you
tried
but
how
am
i
gifted
and
what
things
are
expected
he
asked
perhaps
angling
for
further
flattering
disclosures
i
can
not
answer
that
said
clayton
vernon
it
is
for
you
to
answer
you
have
given
all
your
friends
the
impression
that
you
would
do
something
worth
doing
you
have
raised
hopes
and
you
must
not
disappoint
them
we
believe
in
you
richard
that
is
all
i
can
say
that
all
very
well
but
he
stopped
and
played
with
the
seal
on
his
the
fact
is
i
am
working
you
know
i
want
to
be
an
author
at
least
a
journalist
ah
it
a
slow
business
at
first
suddenly
moved
to
be
confidential
he
went
on
to
give
her
some
account
incomplete
and
judiciously
edited
of
his
life
during
the
past
year
you
have
relieved
my
mind
greatly
and
clayton
will
be
so
glad
we
were
beginning
to
think
why
were
you
to
think
well
never
mind
now
but
why
never
mind
i
have
full
confidence
in
you
and
i
am
sure
you
will
get
on
poor
boy
you
have
no
near
connections
or
relatives
now
no
none
you
must
look
on
clayton
and
myself
as
very
near
relatives
we
have
no
children
but
our
hearts
are
large
i
shall
expect
you
to
write
to
me
sometimes
and
to
come
and
stay
with
us
now
and
then
chapter
ix
in
the
centre
of
the
at
the
british
museum
sit
four
men
fenced
about
by
a
quadruple
ring
of
unwieldy
volumes
which
are
an
index
to
all
the
knowledge
in
the
world
the
four
men
know
those
volumes
as
a
good
courier
knows
the
continental
bradshaw
and
all
day
long
from
early
morning
when
the
attendants
on
wheeled
stools
run
around
the
rings
arranging
and
aligning
the
huge
blue
tomes
to
late
afternoon
when
the
immense
dome
is
like
a
dark
night
and
the
arc
lamps
hiss
and
crackle
in
the
silence
they
answer
questions
patiently
courteously
they
are
seldom
embarrassed
and
less
seldom
in
the
wrong
radiating
in
long
rows
from
the
central
fortress
of
learning
a
diversified
company
of
readers
disposes
itself
bishops
statesmen
men
of
science
historians
needy
pedants
popular
authors
whose
broughams
are
waiting
in
the
precincts
journalists
medical
students
law
students
curates
women
with
clipped
hair
and
black
aprons
idlers
all
and
all
silent
every
few
minutes
an
official
enters
in
charge
of
an
awed
group
of
country
visitors
and
whispers
mechanically
the
unchanging
formula
eighty
thousand
volumes
in
this
room
alone
miles
of
bookshelves
in
the
museum
altogether
whereupon
the
visitors
stare
about
them
the
official
unsuccessfully
endeavours
not
to
let
it
appear
that
the
credit
of
the
business
belongs
entirely
to
himself
and
the
party
retires
again
vague
reverberating
noises
roll
heavily
from
time
to
time
across
the
chamber
but
no
one
looks
up
the
incessant
cannibal
feast
of
the
living
upon
the
dead
goes
speechlessly
forward
the
trucks
of
food
are
always
moving
to
and
fro
and
the
nonchalant
waiters
seem
to
take
no
rest
almost
richard
first
care
on
coming
to
london
had
been
to
obtain
a
reader
ticket
for
the
british
museum
and
for
several
months
he
had
made
a
practice
of
spending
saturday
afternoon
there
following
no
special
line
of
study
or
research
and
chiefly
contenting
himself
with
desultory
reading
in
the
twenty
thousand
volumes
which
could
be
reached
down
without
the
slow
machinery
of
an
order
form
after
a
time
the
charm
of
the
place
had
dwindled
and
other
occupations
filled
his
saturday
afternoons
but
when
upon
his
return
from
william
funeral
he
stepped
from
euston
station
into
bloomsbury
the
old
enthusiasms
came
back
in
all
their
original
freshness
the
seduction
of
the
street
vistas
the
lofty
buildings
and
the
swiftly
flitting
hansoms
once
more
made
mere
wayfaring
a
delight
the
old
feeling
of
power
lifted
his
chin
and
the
failures
of
the
past
were
forgotten
in
a
dream
of
future
possibilities
he
dwelt
with
pleasure
on
that
part
of
his
conversation
with
clayton
vernon
which
disclosed
the
interesting
fact
that
bursley
would
be
hurt
if
he
failed
to
do
things
bursley
and
especially
clayton
vernon
good
woman
should
not
be
disappointed
he
had
towards
his
native
town
the
sentiments
of
a
consciously
clever
husband
who
divines
an
admiring
trust
in
the
glance
of
a
little
ignoramus
of
a
wife
such
faith
was
indeed
touching
one
of
the
numerous
resolutions
which
he
made
was
to
resume
attendance
at
the
british
museum
the
first
visit
was
anticipated
with
impatience
and
when
he
found
himself
once
more
within
the
walls
of
the
he
was
annoyed
to
discover
that
his
plans
for
study
were
not
matured
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
realise
any
definite
part
of
them
however
small
that
day
an
idea
for
an
article
on
white
elephants
was
nebulous
in
his
brain
he
felt
sure
that
the
subject
might
be
treated
in
a
fascinating
manner
if
only
he
could
put
hands
on
the
right
material
an
hour
passed
in
searching
poole
index
and
other
works
of
reference
without
result
and
richard
spent
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
in
evolving
from
old
magazines
schemes
for
articles
which
would
present
fewer
difficulties
in
working
out
nothing
of
value
was
accomplished
and
yet
he
experienced
neither
disappointment
nor
a
sense
of
failure
contact
with
innumerable
books
of
respectable
but
forbidding
appearance
had
cajoled
him
as
frequently
before
into
the
delusion
that
he
had
been
industrious
surely
it
was
impossible
that
a
man
could
remain
long
in
that
atmosphere
of
scholarly
attainment
without
acquiring
knowledge
and
improving
his
mind
presently
he
abandoned
the
concoction
of
attractive
titles
for
his
articles
and
began
to
look
through
some
volumes
of
the
biographie
universelle
the
room
was
thinning
now
he
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
turned
six
he
had
been
there
nearly
four
hours
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
replaced
all
his
books
and
turned
to
go
mentally
discussing
whether
or
not
so
much
application
did
not
entitle
him
in
spite
of
certain
resolutions
to
go
to
the
ottoman
that
evening
hey
a
voice
called
out
as
he
passed
the
glass
screen
near
the
door
it
sang
resonantly
among
the
desks
and
ascended
into
the
dome
a
number
of
readers
looked
up
richard
turned
round
sharply
and
beheld
aked
moving
a
forefinger
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
been
here
long
the
older
man
asked
when
richard
had
come
round
to
him
i
been
here
all
day
first
time
for
fifteen
years
at
least
strange
we
did
see
each
other
they
got
a
beastly
new
regulation
about
novels
less
than
five
years
old
not
being
available
i
particularly
wanted
some
of
gissing
not
for
the
mere
fun
of
reading
of
course
because
i
read
before
i
wanted
them
for
a
special
purpose
i
may
tell
you
about
it
some
day
and
i
could
get
them
at
least
several
of
them
what
a
tremendous
crowd
there
is
here
nowadays
well
you
see
it
saturday
afternoon
richard
put
in
and
saturday
afternoon
the
only
time
that
most
people
can
come
unless
they
men
of
independent
means
like
yourself
you
seem
to
have
got
a
few
novels
besides
gissing
though
about
forty
volumes
were
stacked
upon
aked
desk
many
of
them
open
yes
but
i
done
now
he
began
to
close
the
books
with
a
smack
and
to
pitch
them
down
roughly
in
new
heaps
exactly
like
a
petulant
boy
handling
see
pile
them
between
my
arms
and
i
bet
you
i
carry
them
away
all
at
once
oh
no
i
help
you
richard
laughed
it
be
far
less
trouble
than
picking
up
what
you
drop
while
they
were
waiting
at
the
centre
desk
aked
said
there
something
about
this
place
that
makes
you
ask
for
more
volumes
than
can
possibly
be
useful
to
you
i
question
whether
i
done
any
good
here
at
all
if
i
been
content
with
three
or
four
books
instead
of
thirty
or
forty
i
might
have
done
something
by
the
way
what
are
you
here
for
well
i
just
came
to
look
up
a
few
points
richard
answered
vaguely
i
been
messing
about
got
a
notion
or
two
for
articles
that
all
aked
stopped
to
shake
hands
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
the
museum
richard
was
very
disappointed
that
their
meeting
should
have
been
so
short
this
man
of
strange
vivacity
had
thrown
a
spell
over
him
richard
was
sure
that
his
conversation
if
only
he
could
be
persuaded
to
talk
would
prove
delightfully
original
and
suggestive
he
guessed
that
they
were
mutually
sympathetic
ever
since
their
encounter
in
the
a
shop
richard
had
desired
to
know
more
of
him
and
now
when
by
chance
they
met
again
aked
manner
showed
little
or
no
inclination
towards
a
closer
acquaintance
there
was
of
course
a
difference
between
them
in
age
of
at
least
thirty
years
but
to
richard
that
seemed
no
bar
to
an
intimacy
it
was
he
surmised
only
the
physical
part
of
aked
that
had
grown
old
well
should
he
ask
if
he
might
call
at
aked
rooms
or
house
or
whatever
his
abode
was
he
hesitated
from
nervousness
often
come
here
generally
on
saturdays
said
richard
we
may
see
each
other
again
then
sometime
richard
left
him
rather
sadly
and
the
sound
of
the
old
man
quick
alert
footsteps
he
almost
stamped
receded
in
the
direction
of
southampton
row
a
minute
later
as
richard
was
turning
round
by
mudie
out
of
museum
street
a
hand
touched
his
shoulder
it
was
aked
by
the
way
the
man
face
crinkled
into
a
smile
as
he
spoke
are
you
doing
anything
nothing
whatever
let
go
and
have
dinner
together
i
know
a
good
french
place
in
soho
oh
thanks
i
shall
be
awfully
pleased
half
a
crown
can
you
afford
certainly
i
can
said
richard
perhaps
a
little
annoyed
until
he
recollected
that
aked
had
used
exactly
the
same
phrase
on
a
previous
occasion
i
pay
for
the
wine
not
at
all
i
pay
for
the
wine
aked
repeated
decisively
all
right
you
told
me
about
this
soho
place
before
if
you
remember
so
i
did
so
i
did
so
i
did
what
made
you
turn
back
a
whim
young
friend
nothing
else
take
my
arm
richard
laughed
aloud
for
no
reason
in
particular
except
that
he
felt
happy
they
settled
to
a
brisk
walk
the
restaurant
was
a
square
apartment
with
a
low
and
smoky
beamed
ceiling
and
shining
brass
all
round
the
walls
above
the
were
framed
advertisements
of
liqueurs
and
french
italian
and
spanish
wines
the
little
tables
whose
stiff
snowy
cloths
came
near
to
touching
the
floor
at
every
side
gleamed
and
glittered
in
the
light
of
a
fire
the
place
was
empty
save
for
an
old
waiter
who
was
lighting
the
gas
the
waiter
turned
a
large
mild
countenance
to
aked
as
the
two
entered
and
smiling
benignly
greeted
him
with
a
flow
of
french
and
received
a
brief
reply
in
the
same
language
richard
failed
to
comprehend
what
was
said
they
chose
a
table
near
the
fire
aked
at
once
pulled
a
book
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
read
and
richard
somewhat
accustomed
by
this
time
to
his
peculiarities
found
nothing
extraordinary
in
such
conduct
this
plain
little
restaurant
seemed
full
of
enchantment
he
was
in
paris
not
the
great
paris
which
is
reached
charing
cross
but
that
little
paris
which
hides
itself
in
the
immensity
of
london
french
newspapers
were
scattered
about
the
room
the
sound
of
french
voices
came
musically
through
an
open
door
the
bread
which
was
presently
brought
in
with
the
was
french
and
the
setting
of
the
table
itself
showed
an
exotic
daintiness
which
he
had
never
seen
before
outside
a
barrel
organ
was
piercingly
strident
in
the
misty
dusk
above
the
panes
of
the
window
richard
could
faintly
descry
the
upper
storeys
of
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
there
was
a
black
and
yellow
sign
umberto
club
and
above
that
a
blue
and
red
sign
blanchisserie
française
still
higher
was
an
open
window
from
which
leaned
a
young
negligently
dressed
woman
with
a
coarse
southern
face
she
swung
a
idly
in
her
hand
the
fell
and
was
swallowed
by
the
ground
glass
and
the
woman
with
a
gesture
of
despair
disappeared
from
the
window
the
barrel
organ
momentarily
ceased
its
melody
and
then
struck
up
anew
everything
seemed
strangely
delightfully
unsubstantial
even
the
meek
bland
face
of
the
waiter
as
he
deftly
poured
out
the
soup
aked
having
asked
for
the
wine
list
called
cinquante
georges
vous
plait
and
divided
his
attention
impartially
between
his
soup
and
his
book
richard
picked
up
the
echo
de
paris
which
lay
on
a
neighbouring
chair
on
the
first
page
was
a
reference
in
displayed
type
to
the
success
of
the
feuilleton
notre
collaborateur
catulle
mendès
how
wondrously
enticing
the
feuilleton
looked
with
its
descriptive
paragraphs
cleverly
diversified
by
short
lines
of
dialogue
and
at
the
end
catulle
mendès
suivre
réproduction
interdite
half
paris
probably
was
reading
that
feuilleton
catulle
mendès
was
a
real
man
and
no
doubt
eating
his
dinner
at
that
moment
when
the
fish
came
and
georges
had
gently
poured
out
the
wine
aked
tongue
was
loosed
and
how
has
the
muse
been
behaving
herself
he
began
richard
told
him
with
as
little
circumlocution
as
pride
would
allow
the
history
of
the
last
few
sterile
months
i
suppose
you
feel
a
bit
downhearted
not
in
the
least
answered
richard
bravely
and
just
then
his
reply
was
approximately
true
feel
downhearted
well
of
course
one
gets
a
bit
sick
sometimes
let
see
the
how
many
words
have
you
written
this
month
how
many
words
richard
laughed
i
never
count
what
i
do
in
that
way
but
it
not
much
i
have
felt
in
the
humour
there
was
the
funeral
that
put
me
off
i
suppose
you
think
you
must
write
only
the
mood
is
on
aked
spoke
sarcastically
and
then
laughed
quite
a
mistake
give
you
this
bit
of
advice
and
charge
nothing
for
it
sit
down
every
night
and
write
five
hundred
words
descriptive
of
some
scene
which
has
occurred
during
the
day
never
mind
how
tired
you
are
do
it
do
it
for
six
months
and
then
compare
the
earlier
work
with
the
later
and
you
keep
on
richard
drank
the
wisdom
in
did
you
do
that
once
i
did
sir
everyone
does
it
that
comes
to
anything
i
did
come
to
anything
though
i
made
a
bit
of
money
at
one
time
but
then
mine
was
a
queer
case
i
was
knocked
over
by
dyspepsia
beware
of
dyspepsia
i
was
violently
dyspeptic
for
twenty
years
simply
could
write
then
i
cured
myself
but
it
was
too
late
to
begin
again
he
spoke
in
gulps
between
mouthfuls
of
fish
how
did
you
cure
yourself
the
man
took
no
notice
of
the
question
and
went
on
and
if
i
have
written
anything
for
twenty
years
i
still
an
author
at
heart
in
fact
i
got
something
the
air
now
oh
always
had
the
literary
temperament
badly
do
you
ever
catch
yourself
watching
instinctively
for
the
characteristic
phrase
i
afraid
i
do
quite
know
what
you
mean
eh
richard
repeated
what
he
had
said
but
aked
was
absorbed
in
pouring
out
another
glass
of
wine
i
wish
you
tell
me
richard
began
after
a
pause
how
you
first
to
write
or
rather
to
get
printed
my
dear
little
friend
i
ca
tell
you
anything
new
i
wrote
for
several
years
and
never
sold
a
line
and
for
what
peculiar
reason
should
you
think
simply
because
not
a
line
was
worth
printing
then
my
things
began
to
be
accepted
i
sold
a
story
first
i
forget
the
title
but
i
remember
there
was
a
railway
accident
in
it
and
it
happened
to
come
before
the
editor
of
a
magazine
just
when
everyone
was
greatly
excited
about
a
railway
smash
in
the
west
of
england
i
got
thirty
shillings
for
that
i
think
i
should
get
on
all
right
enough
if
only
i
could
sell
thing
richard
sighed
well
you
must
wait
why
damn
it
all
man
he
stopped
to
drink
and
richard
noticed
how
his
hand
shook
how
long
have
you
been
working
seriously
not
a
year
if
you
were
going
in
for
painting
you
surely
would
expect
to
sell
pictures
after
only
a
year
study
aked
showed
a
naïve
appreciation
of
himself
in
the
part
of
a
veteran
who
deigns
to
give
a
raw
recruit
the
benefit
of
vast
experience
of
course
not
assented
richard
abashed
well
then
do
begin
to
whine
after
the
cheese
aked
ordered
coffee
and
cognac
and
sixpenny
cigars
they
smoked
in
silence
do
you
know
richard
blurted
out
at
length
the
fact
is
i
not
sure
that
i
meant
for
writing
at
all
i
never
take
any
pleasure
writing
it
a
confounded
nuisance
he
almost
trembled
with
apprehension
as
he
uttered
the
words
you
like
thinking
about
what
you
going
to
write
arranging
observing
yes
i
like
that
awfully
well
here
a
secret
no
writer
does
like
writing
at
least
not
one
in
a
hundred
and
the
exception
ten
to
one
is
a
howling
mediocrity
that
a
fact
but
all
the
same
they
miserable
if
they
do
write
i
glad
there
hope
when
richard
had
finished
his
coffee
it
occurred
to
him
to
mention
miss
roberts
do
you
ever
go
to
the
crabtree
he
asked
not
of
late
i
only
ask
because
there
a
girl
there
who
knows
you
she
inquired
of
me
how
you
were
not
long
since
a
girl
who
knows
me
who
the
devil
may
she
be
i
fancy
her
name
roberts
aha
so
she
got
a
new
place
has
she
she
lives
in
my
street
how
i
know
her
nice
little
thing
rather
he
made
no
further
remark
on
the
subject
but
there
remained
an
absent
amused
smile
on
his
face
and
he
pulled
at
his
lower
lip
and
fastened
his
gaze
on
the
table
you
must
come
down
sometime
and
see
me
my
niece
keeps
house
for
me
he
said
before
they
separated
giving
an
address
in
fulham
he
wrung
richard
hand
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
winking
boyishly
and
went
off
whistling
to
himself
very
quietly
in
the
upper
register
chapter
x
the
slender
badly
hung
gate
closed
of
itself
behind
him
with
a
resounding
clang
communicating
a
little
thrill
to
the
ground
in
answer
to
his
ring
a
girl
came
to
the
door
she
was
rather
short
thin
and
dressed
in
black
with
a
clean
white
apron
in
the
half
light
of
the
narrow
lobby
he
made
out
a
mahogany
of
conventional
shape
and
on
a
wooden
bracket
a
small
lamp
with
a
tarnished
reflector
no
richard
heard
in
a
quiet
tranquil
voice
aked
has
just
gone
out
for
a
walk
he
did
say
what
time
he
should
be
back
can
i
give
him
any
message
he
sent
me
a
card
to
come
down
and
see
him
this
afternoon
and
come
he
said
about
seven
it
a
quarter
past
now
but
perhaps
he
forgot
all
about
it
will
you
step
inside
he
may
only
be
away
for
a
minute
or
two
no
thanks
if
you
just
tell
him
i
called
i
so
sorry
the
girl
raised
her
hand
and
rested
it
against
the
jamb
of
the
doorway
her
eyes
were
set
slantwise
on
the
strip
of
garden
and
she
seemed
to
muse
an
instant
are
you
mr
larch
she
asked
hesitatingly
just
as
richard
was
saying
yes
answered
richard
uncle
was
telling
me
he
had
had
dinner
with
you
i
he
be
back
soon
wo
you
wait
a
little
while
well
she
stood
aside
and
richard
passed
into
the
lobby
the
front
room
into
which
he
was
ushered
was
full
of
dim
shadows
attributable
to
the
multiplicity
of
curtains
which
obscured
the
small
bay
window
carteret
street
and
the
florid
tawny
avenues
that
run
parallel
to
it
contain
hundreds
of
living
rooms
almost
precisely
similar
its
dimensions
were
thirteen
feet
by
eleven
and
the
height
of
the
ceiling
appeared
to
bring
the
walls
which
were
papered
in
an
undecipherable
pattern
of
blue
even
closer
together
than
they
really
were
linoleum
with
a
few
rugs
served
for
a
carpet
the
fireplace
was
of
painted
stone
and
a
fancy
screen
of
south
african
grasses
hid
the
grate
behind
a
clock
and
some
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
rose
a
confection
of
walnut
and
silvered
glass
a
mahogany
chiffonier
filled
the
side
of
the
room
farthest
from
the
window
it
had
a
marble
top
and
a
large
mirror
framed
in
scroll
work
and
was
littered
with
fruit
plates
and
silver
nicknacks
the
table
a
square
one
was
covered
by
a
red
cloth
of
texture
patterned
in
black
the
chairs
were
of
mahogany
and
horsehair
and
matched
the
sofa
which
stretched
from
the
door
nearly
to
the
window
several
prints
framed
in
gilt
and
oak
depended
by
means
of
stout
green
cord
from
french
nails
with
great
earthenware
heads
in
the
recess
to
the
left
of
the
hearth
stood
a
piano
open
and
a
song
on
the
what
distinguished
the
room
from
others
of
its
type
was
a
dwarf
bookcase
filled
chiefly
with
french
novels
whose
vivid
yellow
gratefully
lightened
a
dark
corner
next
the
door
uncle
is
very
forgetful
the
girl
began
there
was
some
sewing
on
the
table
and
she
had
already
taken
it
up
richard
felt
shy
and
ill
at
ease
but
his
companion
showed
no
symptom
of
discomposure
he
smiled
vaguely
not
knowing
what
to
reply
i
suppose
he
walks
a
good
deal
he
said
at
length
yes
he
does
there
was
a
second
pause
the
girl
continued
to
sew
quietly
she
appeared
to
be
indifferent
whether
they
conversed
or
not
i
see
you
are
a
musician
oh
no
she
laughed
and
looked
at
his
eyes
i
sing
a
very
little
bit
do
you
sing
schubert
songs
schubert
no
are
they
good
rather
they
songs
classical
i
suppose
her
tone
implied
that
classical
songs
were
outside
the
region
of
the
practical
yes
of
course
i
do
think
i
care
much
for
classical
music
but
you
should
should
i
why
she
laughed
gaily
like
a
child
amused
hope
songs
are
nice
and
river
of
years
i
just
learning
that
do
you
sing
no
i
do
really
sing
i
have
got
a
piano
at
my
place
now
what
a
pity
i
suppose
you
know
a
great
deal
about
music
i
wish
i
did
said
richard
trying
awkwardly
not
to
seem
flattered
a
third
pause
aked
seems
to
have
a
fine
lot
of
french
novels
i
wish
i
had
as
many
yes
he
always
bringing
them
in
and
this
is
the
latest
eh
he
picked
up
tigrane
which
lay
on
the
table
by
the
sewing
yes
i
fancy
uncle
got
that
last
night
you
read
french
of
course
i
no
indeed
again
she
laughed
you
must
imagine
larch
she
went
on
and
her
small
eyes
twinkled
that
i
am
at
all
like
uncle
i
not
i
only
kept
house
for
him
a
little
while
and
we
are
really
quite
different
how
do
you
mean
uncle
well
the
quiet
voice
was
imperceptibly
raised
i
not
a
great
reader
and
i
know
nothing
of
books
i
not
clever
you
know
i
bear
poetry
richard
looked
indulgent
but
you
do
read
yes
sometimes
a
novel
i
reading
lynne
uncle
bought
it
for
me
the
other
day
and
you
like
it
there
was
a
timid
tap
at
the
door
and
a
short
stout
servant
with
red
hands
and
a
red
face
entered
her
rough
chubby
forearms
were
bare
and
she
carried
a
market
basket
please
she
ejaculated
meaningly
and
disappeared
aked
niece
excused
herself
and
when
she
returned
richard
looked
at
his
watch
and
rose
i
very
sorry
about
uncle
but
it
just
like
him
yes
is
it
richard
answered
and
they
exchanged
a
smile
he
walked
down
carteret
street
humming
a
tuneless
air
and
twirling
his
stick
aked
niece
had
proved
rather
disappointing
she
was
an
ordinary
girl
and
evidently
quite
unsusceptible
to
the
artistic
influences
which
subtly
emanated
from
aked
but
with
the
exception
of
his
landlady
and
his
landlady
daughter
she
was
the
first
woman
whom
richard
had
met
in
london
and
the
interview
had
been
somewhat
of
an
ordeal
yes
it
was
matter
for
regret
suppose
she
had
been
clever
witty
full
of
that
nameless
charm
with
which
youths
invest
the
ideal
maidens
of
their
dreams
with
which
indeed
during
the
past
week
he
had
invested
her
he
might
have
married
her
then
guided
by
the
experience
of
a
sympathetic
he
would
have
realised
all
his
ambitions
a
vision
of
richard
larch
the
editor
and
his
charming
wife
giving
a
to
a
carefully
selected
company
of
literary
celebrities
flitted
before
him
alas
the
girl
east
lynne
her
ballads
the
mean
little
the
complacent
vulgarity
of
the
room
the
house
the
street
the
neighbourhood
combined
effectually
to
dispel
it
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
no
aspirations
it
was
necessary
to
wait
for
a
train
at
parson
green
station
from
the
elevated
platform
grass
was
visible
through
a
gently
falling
mist
the
curving
rails
stole
away
mysteriously
into
a
general
greyness
and
the
twilight
assuaging
every
crudity
of
the
suburban
landscape
gave
an
impression
of
vast
spaces
and
perfect
serenity
save
for
the
porter
leisurely
lighting
the
station
lamps
he
was
alone
alone
as
it
seemed
to
him
in
an
upper
world
above
london
and
especially
above
fulham
and
the
house
where
lived
the
girl
who
read
east
lynne
how
commonplace
must
she
be
richard
wondered
that
aked
could
exist
surrounded
by
all
the
banalities
of
carteret
street
even
his
own
lodging
was
more
attractive
for
at
least
raphael
street
was
within
sound
of
the
central
hum
and
beat
of
the
city
a
signal
suddenly
shone
out
in
the
distance
it
might
have
been
a
lighthouse
seen
across
unnumbered
miles
of
calm
ocean
rain
began
to
fall
chapter
xi
richard
sabbaths
had
become
days
of
dismal
torpor
a
year
ago
on
first
arriving
in
london
he
had
projected
a
series
of
visits
to
churches
famous
either
for
architectural
beauty
or
for
picturesque
ritual
a
few
weeks
however
had
brought
tedium
he
was
fundamentally
irreligious
and
his
churchgoing
proceeded
from
a
craving
purely
sensuous
which
sought
gratification
in
ceremonial
pomps
twilight
atmospheres
heavy
with
incense
and
electric
with
devotion
and
dim
perspectives
of
arching
stone
but
these
things
he
soon
discovered
lost
their
fine
savour
by
the
mere
presence
of
a
prim
congregation
secure
in
the
brass
armour
of
for
him
the
worship
was
spoilt
by
the
worshippers
and
so
the
time
came
when
the
only
church
which
he
cared
to
attend
and
even
to
this
he
went
but
infrequently
lest
use
should
stale
its
charm
was
the
roman
catholic
oratory
of
philip
neri
where
at
mass
the
separation
of
the
sexes
struck
a
grateful
note
of
austerity
and
the
mean
appearance
of
the
people
contrasted
admirably
with
the
splendour
of
the
priests
vestments
the
elaborate
music
and
the
gilt
and
colour
of
altars
here
deity
was
omnipotent
and
humanity
abject
men
and
women
of
all
grades
casting
themselves
down
before
the
holy
images
in
the
ecstatic
abandonment
of
repentance
prayed
side
by
side
oblivious
of
everything
save
their
sins
and
the
anger
of
a
god
as
a
spectacle
the
oratory
was
sublime
he
visited
it
about
once
a
month
the
mornings
of
intervening
sundays
were
given
to
aimless
perambulation
of
the
parks
desultory
reading
or
sleep
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
leaving
town
for
the
day
but
he
was
so
innocent
of
any
sort
of
rural
lore
that
the
prospect
of
a
few
hours
in
the
country
was
seldom
enticing
enough
to
rouse
sufficient
energy
for
its
accomplishment
after
dinner
he
usually
slept
and
in
the
evening
he
would
take
a
short
walk
and
go
early
to
bed
for
some
reason
he
never
attempted
to
work
on
sundays
it
had
rained
continuously
since
he
left
parson
green
station
on
the
previous
night
till
midday
on
sunday
and
in
the
afternoon
he
was
lounging
half
asleep
with
a
volume
of
verse
on
his
knee
considering
whether
or
not
to
put
on
his
hat
and
go
out
when
lily
entered
lily
was
attired
for
conquest
and
with
her
broad
velvet
hat
and
pink
bows
looked
so
unlike
a
that
drowsy
richard
started
up
uncertain
what
fairy
was
brightening
his
room
please
sir
there
a
young
gentleman
as
wants
to
see
you
oh
who
is
it
no
one
had
ever
called
upon
him
before
i
do
know
sir
it
a
young
the
young
gentleman
was
ushered
in
he
wore
a
new
black
frock
coat
and
light
grey
trousers
which
fell
in
rich
folds
over
new
boots
the
shortcomings
of
his
linen
which
was
dull
and
bluish
in
tint
were
more
than
atoned
for
by
the
magnificence
of
a
new
white
silk
necktie
with
heliotrope
spots
he
carried
a
silk
hat
and
a
pair
of
unworn
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
cigar
and
a
stick
with
whose
physiognomy
richard
was
quite
familiar
hello
jenkins
good
afternoon
larch
i
was
just
passing
this
way
and
i
thought
i
look
you
up
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
more
ridiculous
even
than
he
intended
jenkins
placed
his
hat
stick
and
gloves
on
the
bed
and
nicely
adjusting
the
tails
of
his
coat
occupied
a
chair
the
quarrel
between
richard
and
jenkins
had
been
patched
up
a
few
days
before
so
this
is
your
digs
nice
large
windows
yes
decent
windows
although
these
two
were
on
terms
of
almost
brutal
familiarity
during
office
hours
here
each
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
in
the
presence
jenkins
wiped
his
pallid
unhealthy
face
with
a
cambric
handkerchief
which
he
unfolded
for
the
purpose
been
to
church
this
morning
meditatively
jenkins
flicked
some
into
the
and
then
answered
yes
i
thought
so
why
because
you
such
a
swell
ai
i
just
jenkins
spoke
with
frank
delight
two
guineas
the
suit
my
boy
wo
i
knock
in
the
wal
worth
road
but
where
your
ring
richard
asked
noticing
the
absence
of
the
silver
ring
which
jenkins
commonly
wore
on
his
left
hand
oh
i
gave
it
to
my
sister
she
wanted
to
give
it
to
her
young
man
she
engaged
is
she
yes
at
least
i
suppose
she
is
and
when
are
you
going
to
get
engaged
jenkins
emitted
a
sound
expressive
of
scorn
you
do
catch
me
entering
the
holy
bonds
not
this
child
it
ai
all
lavender
you
bet
i
say
you
know
miss
roberts
at
the
veg
tart
jenkins
was
unaware
that
richard
had
been
going
regularly
to
the
crabtree
i
was
passing
the
place
last
night
just
as
they
were
closing
and
i
walked
down
to
charing
cross
with
her
i
asked
her
to
meet
me
somewhere
but
she
could
you
mean
she
would
well
and
what
sort
she
devilish
nice
tell
you
but
not
my
style
but
there
a
girl
i
know
lives
down
the
camberwell
new
road
she
is
a
treat
now
a
fair
treat
about
seventeen
and
plump
as
a
pigeon
i
shall
see
her
oh
indeed
said
richard
for
the
hundredth
time
marvelling
that
he
should
be
on
a
footing
of
intimacy
with
albert
jenkins
the
girl
at
carteret
street
whatever
her
imperfections
did
not
use
the
cockney
dialect
and
her
smile
was
certainly
alluring
moreover
she
had
dignity
true
she
liked
east
lynne
and
hope
temple
songs
but
it
occurred
to
richard
that
it
might
be
pleasanter
to
listen
even
to
these
despised
melodies
than
to
remain
solitary
at
raphael
street
or
to
accompany
jenkins
on
a
why
should
he
not
go
down
that
afternoon
to
see
aked
and
his
niece
he
immediately
decided
that
he
would
do
so
it
turned
out
fine
said
jenkins
what
are
you
up
to
will
you
come
and
have
a
turn
round
with
me
let
me
see
the
fact
is
i
ca
he
fought
desperately
against
the
temptation
to
mention
that
he
proposed
to
call
on
a
lady
but
in
vain
forth
it
must
come
i
going
to
see
a
girl
aha
exclaimed
jenkins
with
a
terribly
arch
look
so
that
the
little
game
eh
who
the
mash
richard
smiled
reticently
well
i
be
off
jenkins
rose
and
his
eye
caught
richard
little
bookcase
he
scanned
the
titles
of
the
volumes
oh
likewise
ah
zola
now
we
getting
at
the
secret
no
wonder
you
so
damn
studious
zola
indeed
well
so
long
see
you
give
my
love
to
the
girl
i
say
i
suppose
you
got
zola
in
english
have
you
no
never
mind
so
long
chapter
xii
the
little
servant
beamed
an
amiable
recognition
very
hot
day
richard
said
beg
pardon
sir
very
hot
day
rather
louder
they
were
in
the
passage
the
door
of
the
opened
and
aked
niece
stood
before
him
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
her
eyebrows
raised
in
a
gesture
of
warning
she
suddenly
smiled
almost
laughed
richard
remembered
that
smile
for
a
long
time
afterwards
it
transformed
not
only
a
face
but
the
whole
of
carteret
street
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
shaking
hands
in
silence
he
followed
her
into
the
room
and
she
gently
closed
the
door
uncle
not
well
she
explained
he
asleep
now
and
i
want
you
to
wake
him
in
this
house
you
know
if
any
one
speaks
in
the
passage
you
can
hear
it
even
in
the
attic
uncle
was
caught
in
the
rain
last
night
he
has
a
very
weak
chest
and
gets
bronchitis
directly
i
awfully
sorry
i
disturbed
you
said
richard
the
fact
is
i
was
down
this
way
and
i
thought
i
call
it
sounded
a
sufficiently
reasonable
excuse
he
considered
i
hope
you
were
asleep
too
yes
i
was
dozing
in
this
chair
she
put
her
head
back
and
drummed
with
her
fingers
lightly
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
but
i
glad
called
why
oh
because
one
wants
to
see
some
one
some
one
new
especially
after
being
in
a
you
been
sitting
up
late
his
tone
was
accusing
it
seemed
to
him
that
somehow
they
were
already
intimate
only
till
three
and
i
slept
later
this
morning
how
changeable
the
sun
is
she
moved
her
chair
and
he
saw
her
in
profile
her
hands
were
on
her
lap
she
coaxed
a
foot
stool
into
position
with
her
toes
and
placed
her
feet
on
it
you
look
just
like
a
picture
in
this
week
london
news
i
mean
in
general
pose
he
exclaimed
do
i
how
nice
that
sounds
what
is
it
whistler
of
his
mother
but
i
hope
you
do
think
i
think
you
look
old
how
old
do
i
look
she
turned
her
head
slightly
towards
him
about
only
i
imagine
you
much
younger
although
she
did
not
reply
she
made
no
pretence
of
being
annoyed
nor
did
richard
tax
himself
with
a
it
took
me
years
to
like
whistler
pictures
she
said
and
in
response
to
richard
surprised
question
she
was
beginning
to
explain
that
a
large
part
of
her
life
had
been
passed
in
the
companionship
of
works
of
graphic
art
when
a
slippered
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
and
some
one
fumbled
with
the
aked
entered
uncle
you
wicked
old
man
she
sprang
up
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
angrily
whatever
did
you
get
up
for
it
enough
to
kill
you
calm
yourself
my
child
i
got
up
because
i
did
want
to
stay
in
bed
exactly
that
aked
paused
to
take
breath
and
sank
into
a
chair
larch
i
heard
your
voice
in
the
passage
upon
my
word
i
quite
forgot
you
yesterday
i
suppose
adeline
been
telling
you
seriously
ill
eh
ah
i
had
many
a
worse
attack
than
this
put
that
antimacassar
over
my
shoulders
child
he
had
given
richard
a
hot
limp
hand
on
which
the
veins
formed
soft
ridges
in
the
smooth
brittle
skin
his
grey
hair
was
disarranged
and
he
wore
a
dirty
torn
his
face
had
lost
its
customary
alert
expression
but
his
sunk
shining
eyes
glanced
with
mysterious
restlessness
first
at
richard
then
at
adeline
who
uttering
no
further
word
covered
him
well
and
put
the
hassock
under
his
feet
well
well
well
he
sighed
and
closed
his
eyes
wearily
the
other
two
sat
silent
for
a
time
then
adeline
talking
very
quietly
and
with
a
composure
not
quite
unaffected
took
up
their
interrupted
conversation
richard
gathered
that
her
justifiable
vexation
would
remain
in
abeyance
till
he
had
gone
soon
her
tone
grew
more
natural
she
leaned
forward
with
hands
clasped
round
one
knee
and
richard
felt
like
a
receiver
of
confidences
as
she
roughly
outlined
her
life
in
the
country
which
had
come
to
an
end
only
two
years
ago
were
all
the
girls
so
simply
communicative
he
wondered
it
pleased
him
to
decide
that
they
were
not
and
that
to
any
other
but
himself
she
would
have
been
more
reserved
that
there
was
in
fact
an
affinity
between
them
but
the
presence
of
her
uncle
which
adeline
seemed
able
to
ignore
utterly
hindered
richard
from
being
himself
how
do
you
like
london
after
living
so
long
in
the
country
he
asked
inevitably
i
know
practically
nothing
of
london
real
london
she
said
but
i
think
these
suburbs
are
horrid
far
duller
than
the
dullest
village
and
the
people
they
seem
so
uninteresting
to
have
no
character
the
hoarse
fatigued
voice
of
aked
crept
in
between
them
child
he
said
and
he
used
the
appellation
not
with
the
proper
dignity
of
age
but
rather
like
an
omniscient
schoolboy
home
for
the
holiday
addressing
a
sister
child
his
eyes
were
still
closed
the
suburbs
even
walham
green
and
fulham
are
full
of
interest
for
those
who
can
see
it
walk
along
this
very
street
on
such
a
sunday
afternoon
as
the
roofs
form
two
horrible
converging
straight
lines
i
know
but
beneath
there
is
character
individuality
enough
to
make
the
greatest
book
ever
written
note
the
varying
indications
supplied
by
bad
furniture
seen
through
curtained
windows
like
ours
he
grinned
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
listen
to
the
melodies
issuing
lamely
from
pianos
examine
the
enervated
figures
of
women
reclining
amidst
on
narrow
balconies
even
in
the
thin
smoke
ascending
unwillingly
from
invisible
the
flutter
of
a
blind
the
bang
of
a
door
the
winking
of
a
fox
terrier
perched
on
a
the
colour
of
paint
the
lettering
of
a
name
in
all
these
things
there
is
character
and
matter
of
interest
truth
waiting
to
be
expounded
how
many
houses
are
there
in
carteret
street
say
eighty
eighty
theatres
of
love
hate
greed
tyranny
endeavour
eighty
separate
dramas
always
unfolding
intertwining
ending
beginning
and
every
drama
a
tragedy
no
comedies
and
especially
no
farces
why
child
there
is
more
character
within
a
hundred
yards
of
this
chair
than
a
hundred
balzacs
could
analyse
in
a
hundred
years
all
the
old
vivacity
had
returned
to
his
face
he
had
been
rhetorical
on
a
favourite
subject
and
he
was
frankly
pleased
with
himself
you
will
tire
yourself
uncle
said
adeline
shall
we
have
tea
richard
observed
with
astonishment
that
she
was
cold
and
unmoved
surely
she
could
not
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
aked
was
a
very
remarkable
man
with
very
remarkable
ideas
why
by
the
way
had
those
ideas
never
presented
themselves
to
he
would
write
an
article
on
the
of
raphael
street
unwillingly
he
announced
that
he
must
go
to
remain
longer
would
be
to
invite
himself
to
tea
sit
still
larch
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
adeline
left
the
room
and
when
she
had
gone
aked
throwing
a
glance
after
her
said
well
what
do
you
think
of
my
notions
of
the
suburb
they
are
splendid
richard
replied
glowing
there
something
in
them
i
imagine
he
agreed
complacently
had
an
idea
lately
of
beginning
to
scribble
again
i
know
there
a
book
waiting
to
be
written
on
psychology
of
the
suburbs
and
i
do
like
to
see
copy
lying
about
wasted
the
old
scenting
the
battle
you
understand
he
smiled
grandiosely
of
the
suburbs
fine
title
that
see
how
the
silent
takes
away
all
the
crudity
of
the
alliteration
that
because
one
never
listens
to
words
with
the
ears
alone
but
with
the
eyes
also
but
i
should
need
help
i
want
a
clever
chap
who
can
take
down
from
dictation
and
assist
me
in
the
details
of
composition
i
suppose
you
would
care
to
come
here
two
or
three
evenings
a
week
richard
answered
sincerely
that
nothing
would
suit
him
better
i
should
make
you
joint
author
of
course
of
the
suburbs
by
richard
aked
and
richard
larch
it
sounds
rather
catchy
and
i
think
it
ought
to
sell
about
four
hundred
octavo
pages
say
a
hundred
thousand
words
six
shillings
must
be
popular
in
price
we
might
get
a
royalty
of
ninepence
a
copy
if
we
went
to
the
right
publisher
sixpence
for
me
and
threepence
for
you
would
that
do
oh
perfectly
but
was
not
aked
running
on
rather
fast
perhaps
we
better
say
fivepence
halfpenny
for
me
and
threepence
halfpenny
for
you
that
would
be
fairer
because
you
have
to
furnish
ideas
you
know
of
the
suburbs
psychology
of
the
suburbs
fine
title
we
ought
to
do
it
in
six
months
i
hope
you
be
quite
well
again
soon
then
we
quite
well
he
repeated
sharply
i
shall
be
as
right
as
a
trivet
you
do
suppose
that
i
ca
take
care
of
myself
start
at
once
you
not
forgetting
aked
that
you
never
seen
any
of
my
stuff
yet
are
you
sure
i
shall
be
able
to
do
what
you
want
oh
you
do
i
not
seen
your
stuff
but
i
guess
you
got
the
literary
habit
the
literary
habit
that
the
thing
i
soon
put
you
up
to
the
wrinkles
the
trade
secrets
what
is
your
general
plan
of
the
book
richard
asked
with
some
timidity
fearing
to
be
deemed
either
stupid
or
inquisitive
at
the
wrong
moment
he
had
tried
to
say
something
meet
for
a
great
occasion
and
failed
oh
i
go
into
that
at
our
first
formal
conference
say
next
friday
night
speaking
roughly
each
of
the
great
suburban
divisions
has
for
me
at
any
rate
its
own
characteristics
its
peculiar
moral
physiognomy
richard
nodded
appreciatively
take
me
blindfold
to
any
street
in
london
and
i
discover
instantly
from
a
thousand
hints
where
i
am
well
each
of
these
divisions
must
be
described
in
turn
not
topographically
of
course
but
the
inner
spirit
the
soul
of
it
see
people
have
got
into
a
way
of
sneering
at
the
suburbs
why
the
suburbs
london
it
is
alone
the
the
concussion
of
meeting
suburbs
in
the
centre
of
london
that
makes
the
city
and
west
end
interesting
we
could
show
how
the
special
characteristics
of
the
different
suburbs
exert
a
subtle
influence
on
the
great
central
spots
take
fulham
no
one
thinks
anything
of
fulham
but
suppose
it
were
swept
off
the
face
of
the
earth
the
effect
would
be
to
alter
for
the
seeing
eye
the
character
of
piccadilly
and
the
strand
and
cheapside
the
play
of
one
suburb
on
another
and
on
the
central
haunts
is
as
regular
as
orderly
as
calculable
as
the
law
of
gravity
itself
they
continued
the
discussion
until
adeline
came
in
again
with
a
tray
in
her
hands
followed
by
the
little
servant
the
two
began
to
lay
the
cloth
and
the
cheerful
rattle
of
crockery
filled
the
room
sugar
mr
larch
adeline
was
saying
when
aked
looking
meaningly
at
richard
ejaculated
friday
then
richard
nodded
adeline
eyed
her
uncle
distrustfully
for
some
reason
unguessed
by
richard
adeline
left
them
alone
during
most
of
the
evening
and
in
her
absence
aked
continued
to
discourse
in
vague
generalities
not
without
a
specious
poetical
charm
on
the
subject
upon
which
they
were
to
collaborate
until
richard
was
wholly
intoxicated
with
its
fascinating
possibilities
when
he
left
adeline
would
not
allow
aked
to
go
to
the
door
and
went
herself
if
i
had
been
very
firm
she
laughed
as
they
were
shaking
hands
in
the
passage
uncle
would
have
stood
talking
to
you
in
the
street
for
goodness
knows
how
long
and
forgotten
all
about
his
bronchitis
oh
you
authors
i
believe
you
are
every
one
like
babies
richard
smiled
his
gratification
larch
mr
larch
the
roguish
summons
came
after
him
when
he
was
up
the
street
he
ran
back
and
found
her
at
the
gate
with
her
hands
behind
her
what
have
you
forgotten
she
questioned
he
could
see
her
face
but
dimly
in
the
twilight
of
the
i
know
my
umbrella
he
answered
did
i
say
you
were
all
like
little
children
she
said
as
she
whipped
out
the
umbrella
and
gave
it
to
him
over
the
gate
anxious
at
once
to
add
something
original
to
the
sum
of
observations
he
purposely
chose
a
route
home
through
the
western
parts
of
fulham
and
past
the
salisbury
hotel
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
latent
poetry
of
the
suburbs
arose
like
a
beautiful
vapour
and
filled
these
monotonous
and
squalid
vistas
with
the
scent
and
the
colour
of
violets
leaving
nothing
common
nothing
ignoble
in
the
upturned
eyes
of
a
who
went
by
on
the
arm
of
her
lover
he
divined
a
passion
as
pure
as
that
of
eugénie
grandet
on
the
wrinkled
countenance
of
an
older
woman
he
beheld
only
the
nobility
of
suffering
a
youth
who
walked
alone
smoking
a
cigarette
was
a
pathetic
figure
perhaps
condemned
to
years
of
solitude
in
london
when
there
was
no
one
else
to
see
he
saw
adeline
adeline
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
adeline
angry
with
her
uncle
adeline
pouring
out
tea
adeline
reaching
down
his
hat
from
the
peg
adeline
laughing
at
the
gate
there
was
something
about
adeline
that
how
the
name
suited
her
her
past
life
judging
from
the
hints
she
had
given
must
have
been
interesting
perhaps
that
accounted
for
the
charm
which
then
he
returned
to
the
book
he
half
regretted
that
aked
should
have
a
hand
in
it
at
all
he
could
do
it
himself
just
as
plainly
as
if
the
idea
had
been
his
own
he
saw
the
volume
complete
felt
the
texture
of
the
paper
admired
the
disposition
of
the
titlepage
and
the
blue
buckram
binding
he
scanned
the
table
of
contents
and
carelessly
eyed
the
brief
introduction
which
was
however
pregnant
with
meaning
chapter
followed
chapter
in
orderly
scientific
fashion
and
the
last
summoned
up
the
whole
business
in
a
few
masterly
and
dignified
sentences
already
before
a
single
idea
had
been
reduced
to
words
the
psychology
of
the
suburbs
was
finished
a
unique
work
other
authors
had
taken
an
isolated
spot
here
or
there
in
the
suburbs
and
dissected
it
but
none
had
viewed
them
in
their
complex
entirety
none
had
attempted
to
extract
from
their
incoherence
a
coherent
philosophy
to
deal
with
them
sympathetically
as
aked
and
himself
had
done
or
rather
were
to
do
none
had
suspected
that
the
suburbs
were
a
riddle
the
answer
to
which
was
not
undiscoverable
ah
that
secret
that
key
to
the
cipher
he
saw
it
as
it
might
be
behind
a
succession
of
veils
flimsy
obstructions
which
just
then
baffled
his
straining
sight
but
which
he
would
rip
and
rend
when
the
moment
for
effort
came
the
same
lofty
sentiments
occupied
his
brain
the
next
morning
he
paused
in
the
knotting
of
his
necktie
to
look
out
of
the
window
seeking
even
in
raphael
street
some
fragment
of
that
psychology
of
environment
invented
by
aked
nor
did
he
search
quite
in
vain
all
the
phenomena
of
humble
life
hitherto
witnessed
daily
without
a
second
thought
now
appeared
to
carry
some
mysterious
meaning
which
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
itself
friday
when
the
first
formal
conference
was
to
occur
seemed
distressingly
distant
but
he
remembered
that
a
very
hard
day
work
the
casting
and
completing
of
a
gigantic
bill
of
costs
awaited
him
at
the
office
and
he
decided
to
throw
himself
into
it
without
reserve
the
time
would
pass
more
quickly
chapter
xiii
every
solicitor
office
has
its
great
client
whose
affairs
watchfully
managed
by
the
senior
partner
in
person
take
precedence
of
all
else
and
whom
every
member
of
the
staff
regards
with
a
particular
respect
caught
from
the
principals
themselves
curpet
and
smythe
were
london
agents
to
the
tremendous
legal
firm
of
pontifex
of
manchester
said
to
enjoy
the
largest
practice
in
the
midlands
and
they
were
excusably
proud
of
the
fact
one
of
the
first
lessons
that
a
new
clerk
learnt
in
the
establishment
at
new
serjeant
court
was
that
at
no
matter
what
expenditure
of
time
and
trouble
pontifex
business
comprising
some
scores
of
separate
causes
must
be
transacted
so
irreproachably
that
old
pontifex
by
repute
a
terrible
fellow
might
never
have
cause
of
complaint
on
those
mornings
happily
rare
when
a
querulous
letter
did
by
chance
arrive
from
manchester
the
whole
office
trembled
apprehensively
and
any
clerk
likely
to
be
charged
with
negligence
began
at
once
to
consider
the
advisability
of
seeking
a
new
situation
the
pontifex
bill
of
costs
was
made
up
annually
in
june
as
the
time
drew
near
for
presenting
it
more
and
more
clerks
were
pressed
into
its
service
until
at
the
last
everyone
found
himself
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
upon
this
colossal
account
when
richard
arrived
at
the
office
he
found
the
immense
pile
of
white
foolscap
sheets
upon
his
table
and
next
it
the
still
higher
pile
of
blue
sheets
forming
the
draft
bill
all
was
finished
except
the
checking
of
the
figures
and
the
final
castings
as
the
cashier
and
accountant
he
was
ultimately
responsible
for
this
he
parcelled
out
the
sheets
keeping
the
largest
share
for
himself
and
the
work
began
in
every
room
there
was
a
low
muttering
of
figures
broken
by
an
occasional
oath
when
someone
happened
to
lose
the
thread
of
an
addition
the
principals
hovered
about
full
of
solicitude
and
encouragement
and
according
to
custom
on
such
occasions
lunch
was
served
on
the
premises
at
the
firm
expense
richard
continued
to
add
while
eating
keeping
his
head
clear
and
seldom
making
a
mistake
nothing
existed
for
him
but
the
column
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
under
his
eyes
the
pile
of
finished
sheets
grew
and
soon
the
office
boys
commanded
by
jenkins
were
passing
the
earlier
portion
of
the
bill
through
the
as
the
hours
went
by
the
helpers
from
other
departments
no
longer
required
went
back
to
their
own
neglected
duties
and
richard
did
the
last
additions
alone
at
length
the
bill
was
absolutely
finished
and
he
carried
it
himself
to
the
to
be
sewed
in
half
an
hour
it
came
back
and
he
laid
it
ceremoniously
before
curpet
the
grand
total
went
round
the
office
leaping
from
lip
to
lip
like
the
result
of
an
important
parliamentary
poll
it
was
higher
than
in
any
previous
year
by
nearly
a
thousand
pounds
each
of
the
clerks
took
a
personal
pride
in
its
bigness
and
secretly
determined
to
petition
for
an
increase
of
salary
at
the
first
opportunity
they
talked
together
in
groups
discussing
details
while
a
comfortable
lassitude
spread
from
room
to
room
richard
stood
by
the
open
window
absently
watching
the
pigeons
and
the
cleaners
at
the
law
courts
opposite
in
a
corner
an
office
boy
new
to
his
work
was
stamping
envelopes
with
slow
precision
jenkins
with
one
foot
on
a
table
was
tying
a
shoe
lace
it
had
struck
six
ten
minutes
ago
and
everyone
was
gone
except
smythe
whose
departure
jenkins
awaited
with
impatience
the
hot
day
subsided
slowly
to
a
serene
and
lovely
evening
and
the
customary
noises
of
the
strand
ascended
to
richard
like
the
pastoral
hum
of
a
valley
to
a
dweller
on
a
hill
not
breaking
but
rather
completing
the
stillness
of
the
hour
gradually
his
brain
freed
itself
from
the
obsession
of
figures
though
he
continued
to
muse
vaguely
over
the
bill
which
had
just
been
posted
it
would
certainly
be
settled
by
cheque
within
a
week
for
pontifex
were
invariably
prompt
that
cheque
which
he
himself
would
enter
and
pay
into
the
bank
amounted
to
as
much
as
he
could
earn
in
twenty
years
if
he
remained
a
clerk
he
tried
to
imagine
the
scene
in
which
at
some
future
date
he
would
give
curpet
notice
of
his
intention
to
resign
his
position
explaining
that
he
preferred
to
support
himself
by
literature
the
ineffable
sweetness
of
such
a
triumph
could
he
ever
realise
it
he
could
he
must
the
alternative
of
eternal
clerkship
was
not
to
be
endured
his
glance
fell
on
jenkins
that
poor
gay
careless
vulgar
animal
would
always
be
a
clerk
the
thought
filled
him
with
commiseration
and
also
with
pride
fancy
jenkins
writing
a
book
called
the
psychology
of
the
suburbs
i
going
to
smoke
jenkins
said
be
blowed
to
bertie
dear
smythe
had
once
addressed
her
husband
in
the
office
as
bertie
dear
and
thenceforth
that
had
been
his
name
among
the
staff
richard
made
no
answer
when
a
minute
later
jenkins
discreetly
directing
his
puffs
to
the
open
window
asked
him
for
the
titles
of
one
or
two
of
novels
in
english
and
their
price
he
gave
the
required
information
without
turning
round
and
in
a
preoccupied
tone
it
was
his
wish
at
that
moment
to
appear
dreamy
perhaps
a
hint
of
the
intellectual
difference
between
them
would
suggest
itself
even
to
jenkins
suddenly
a
voice
that
seemed
to
be
smythe
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
glass
partition
which
separated
the
room
from
the
general
corridor
jenkins
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
smoking
in
the
office
the
pipe
vanished
instantly
and
jenkins
faced
his
accuser
in
some
confusion
only
to
find
that
he
had
been
victimised
it
was
aked
you
as
gassy
as
ever
i
see
jenkins
said
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
aked
laughed
and
then
began
to
cough
badly
bending
forward
with
flushed
cheeks
surely
you
should
have
left
the
house
richard
said
alarmed
why
not
the
retort
was
almost
fierce
you
not
fit
fiddlesticks
i
only
got
a
bit
of
a
cough
richard
wondered
what
he
had
called
for
jenkins
began
to
discuss
with
him
the
shortcomings
of
smythe
as
an
employer
and
when
that
fruitful
subject
had
been
exhausted
there
was
a
silence
coming
home
aked
asked
richard
who
at
once
prepared
to
leave
by
the
way
larch
how
the
mash
jenkins
wore
his
archest
manner
what
mash
why
the
girl
you
said
you
were
going
to
see
yesterday
afternoon
i
never
said
richard
began
looking
nervously
towards
aked
oh
no
of
course
not
do
you
know
aked
he
begun
his
little
games
with
the
women
these
fellows
from
the
country
so
shy
and
all
that
they
regular
cautions
when
you
come
to
know
them
but
aked
made
no
response
i
was
thinking
you
might
as
well
come
down
night
instead
of
friday
he
said
quietly
to
richard
who
had
busied
himself
with
the
locking
of
a
safe
certainly
i
shall
be
very
glad
richard
answered
evidently
aked
was
as
eager
as
himself
to
make
a
beginning
of
the
book
no
doubt
that
was
why
he
had
called
surely
together
they
would
accomplish
something
notable
jenkins
had
climbed
on
a
lofty
stool
he
gave
vent
to
a
whistle
and
the
other
two
observed
that
his
features
were
twisted
into
an
expression
of
delirious
mirth
aha
aha
he
grinned
looking
at
richard
i
begin
to
perceive
you
after
the
pretty
niece
eh
master
larch
and
a
nice
plump
little
thing
she
is
too
she
came
here
once
to
fetch
uncle
home
aked
sprang
instantly
forward
and
cuffed
jenkins
ear
it
not
the
first
time
i
had
to
do
that
nor
the
second
he
said
i
suppose
you
never
will
learn
to
behave
yourself
jenkins
could
easily
have
thrashed
the
old
man
he
really
looked
old
and
no
consideration
for
the
latter
age
would
have
restrained
him
from
doing
so
had
not
the
habit
of
submission
acquired
during
those
years
when
aked
ruled
the
outer
office
proved
stronger
than
his
rage
as
it
was
he
took
up
a
safe
position
behind
the
stool
and
contented
himself
with
words
you
a
beauty
you
are
he
began
how
the
a
girl
getting
on
you
know
the
one
that
lost
her
place
at
the
restaurant
through
you
if
she
had
been
a
fool
she
have
brought
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
and
how
many
more
are
there
i
wonder
aked
made
an
uncertain
dart
after
him
but
he
vanished
through
the
doorway
only
to
encounter
smythe
with
a
rather
servile
afternoon
sir
to
the
latter
aked
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
office
what
the
devil
are
you
all
up
to
smythe
inquired
crossly
is
aked
after
money
larch
not
at
all
smythe
he
only
called
to
see
me
you
are
a
friend
of
his
are
you
well
i
know
him
h
jenkins
come
and
take
a
letter
as
richard
hurried
down
into
the
court
he
felt
exceedingly
angry
with
aked
why
could
not
the
man
be
more
dignified
everyone
seemed
to
treat
him
with
contempt
and
the
cause
was
not
altogether
obscure
he
had
no
dignity
richard
felt
personally
aggrieved
neither
of
them
spoke
of
the
recent
incident
as
they
walked
down
to
the
temple
station
aked
indeed
said
nothing
a
fit
of
coughing
occupied
him
somehow
richard
faith
in
the
psychology
of
the
suburbs
had
lessened
a
little
during
the
last
chapter
xiv
is
that
you
mr
larch
he
distinctly
made
out
adeline
head
and
bust
above
him
her
white
apron
was
pressed
against
the
bannisters
as
with
extended
arms
and
hands
grasping
the
she
leaned
over
to
see
who
was
below
it
is
miss
aked
he
answered
the
door
was
open
and
so
i
walked
in
is
anything
wrong
i
just
sent
lottie
out
for
the
doctor
uncle
is
very
ill
i
wish
you
see
that
he
comes
at
once
it
in
the
fulham
road
a
little
to
the
left
you
notice
the
red
lamp
as
richard
ran
out
he
met
the
doctor
a
youngish
man
with
a
scots
face
and
grey
hair
hurrying
down
the
street
the
breathless
in
the
rear
master
was
took
ill
last
night
sir
the
latter
said
in
answer
to
richard
question
pneumonia
the
doctor
says
as
it
is
and
something
else
and
there
coming
a
nurse
master
has
attacks
of
it
sir
he
ca
get
his
breath
he
stood
in
the
passage
uncertain
what
to
do
the
doctor
had
already
gone
upstairs
it
must
be
very
serious
he
murmured
yes
sir
lottie
began
to
whimper
richard
said
he
would
call
again
later
to
make
inquiries
and
presently
discovered
himself
in
fulham
road
walking
slowly
towards
putney
aked
case
was
hopeless
of
that
richard
felt
sure
the
man
must
be
getting
on
in
years
and
his
frame
not
constitutionally
vigorous
had
doubtless
been
fatally
weakened
by
carelessness
what
a
strange
creature
of
whims
and
enthusiasms
he
was
although
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
his
age
richard
never
regarded
him
as
more
than
a
few
years
older
than
himself
he
had
none
of
the
melancholy
the
circumspection
the
fixity
of
view
the
prudent
tendency
towards
compromise
the
serene
contented
apathy
which
usually
mark
his
time
of
life
he
was
still
delicately
susceptible
to
new
influences
his
ideals
were
as
fluid
as
richard
own
life
had
taught
him
scarcely
anything
and
least
of
all
sagacity
and
a
dignified
carriage
he
was
the
typical
bachelor
whose
deeper
feelings
have
never
been
stirred
did
regrets
for
a
possibly
happier
past
shadows
of
dead
faces
the
memory
of
kisses
ever
ruffle
his
equanimity
richard
thought
not
he
must
always
have
lived
in
the
present
but
he
was
an
artist
though
somehow
the
man
had
descended
in
his
estimation
richard
clung
to
that
he
possessed
imagination
and
he
possessed
intellect
and
he
could
fuse
them
together
yet
he
had
been
a
failure
viewed
in
certain
lights
richard
admitted
he
was
a
pitiful
figure
what
was
his
true
history
richard
felt
instinctively
that
none
could
answer
that
question
even
in
outline
except
aked
and
suddenly
he
discerned
that
the
nature
apparently
frank
to
immodesty
had
its
own
reserves
the
existence
of
which
few
ever
suspected
and
when
the
worst
was
said
aked
possessed
originality
in
an
incongruous
way
he
still
retained
the
naïve
graces
of
youthfulness
he
was
inspiring
and
had
exerted
influences
for
which
richard
could
not
but
be
grateful
the
psychology
of
the
suburbs
had
receded
swiftly
into
the
background
a
beautiful
impossible
idea
richard
knew
now
that
it
could
never
have
been
carried
out
a
little
progress
would
have
been
made
and
then
as
difficulties
increased
both
he
and
aked
would
have
tacitly
abandoned
their
enterprise
they
were
very
much
alike
he
thought
and
the
fancied
similarity
pleased
him
perhaps
at
some
future
time
he
might
himself
carry
the
undertaking
to
completion
in
which
case
he
would
dedicate
his
book
to
the
memory
of
aked
he
did
not
regret
that
the
dream
of
the
last
few
days
was
ended
it
had
been
very
enjoyable
but
the
awakening
since
according
to
his
present
wisdom
it
must
have
occurred
sooner
or
later
was
less
unpleasant
now
than
it
could
have
been
at
any
more
advanced
stage
moreover
it
was
pleasant
to
dream
of
the
dream
aked
was
dying
he
knew
it
from
adeline
tone
poor
adeline
to
whom
would
she
turn
she
had
implied
that
the
only
relatives
for
whom
she
cared
these
being
on
her
mother
side
were
in
america
from
whom
would
she
seek
assistance
who
would
conduct
the
formalities
of
the
funeral
and
the
testamentary
business
such
as
it
was
his
loathing
for
funerals
seemed
to
have
vanished
and
he
was
not
without
hope
that
adeline
though
their
acquaintance
was
of
the
shortest
might
engage
his
help
for
her
helplessness
and
after
the
funeral
what
would
she
do
since
she
would
probably
have
enough
to
live
upon
she
might
elect
to
remain
where
she
was
in
which
case
he
would
visit
her
now
and
then
of
an
evening
her
imminent
loneliness
gave
her
a
pathetic
charm
and
he
made
haste
to
draw
a
picture
of
himself
and
her
on
either
side
the
fireplace
talking
familiarly
while
she
knitted
or
sewed
yes
he
was
actually
a
grown
man
and
entitled
to
his
romances
he
might
eventually
fall
in
love
with
her
having
discovered
in
her
character
rare
qualities
now
unsuspected
it
was
improbable
but
not
impossible
and
he
had
in
fact
already
glanced
at
the
contingency
several
times
before
oh
for
a
passion
a
glorious
infatuation
even
if
it
ended
in
disaster
and
ruin
the
difficulty
was
that
adeline
fell
short
of
the
ideal
lover
that
virginal
abstraction
was
to
have
been
an
artist
of
some
sort
absolutely
irreligious
broad
in
social
views
the
essence
of
refinement
with
a
striking
but
not
necessarily
beautiful
face
and
isolated
untrammelled
by
friends
adeline
was
no
artist
he
feared
she
might
be
a
regular
attendant
at
chapel
and
painfully
orthodox
as
to
the
sexual
relations
was
she
refined
had
she
a
striking
face
he
said
yes
twice
her
voice
was
low
and
full
of
pretty
modulations
soon
perhaps
she
would
be
alone
in
the
world
if
only
she
had
been
an
artist
that
deficiency
he
was
afraid
would
prove
fatal
to
any
serious
attachment
still
it
would
be
good
to
visit
her
he
was
crossing
putney
bridge
night
had
fallen
and
the
full
brilliant
moon
showed
a
narrow
stream
crawling
between
two
broad
flats
of
mud
just
below
the
bridge
a
barge
lay
at
anchor
the
silhouette
of
a
man
moved
leisurely
about
on
it
and
then
a
boat
detached
itself
from
the
stem
of
the
barge
and
dropped
down
river
into
darkness
on
the
bridge
busses
and
waggons
rattled
noisily
young
men
with
straw
hats
and
girls
in
white
blouses
and
black
skirts
passed
to
and
fro
in
pairs
some
chattering
some
silent
the
sight
of
these
couples
gave
richard
an
idea
for
the
abandoned
psychology
of
the
suburbs
what
if
aked
recovered
he
remembered
his
sister
telling
him
that
their
grandfather
had
survived
after
having
been
three
times
surrendered
to
death
by
the
doctors
the
psychology
of
the
suburbs
began
to
attract
him
it
might
come
to
completion
if
aked
lived
and
then
but
what
about
those
evenings
with
the
lonely
adeline
the
two
vistas
of
the
future
clashed
with
and
obscured
each
other
and
he
was
overcome
by
vague
foreboding
he
saw
aked
struggling
for
breath
in
the
mean
suburban
bedroom
and
adeline
powerless
at
his
side
the
pathos
of
her
position
became
intolerable
when
he
got
back
to
carteret
street
it
was
she
who
came
to
the
door
how
is
he
about
the
same
the
nurse
has
come
she
told
me
to
go
to
bed
at
once
but
i
do
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
sleep
you
will
sit
down
a
little
she
took
the
and
leaning
back
with
a
gesture
of
lassitude
rocked
gently
her
white
face
with
the
red
eyes
and
drooping
eyelids
gave
sign
of
excessive
fatigue
and
on
her
lips
there
was
a
gloomy
pout
after
she
had
described
aked
condition
in
some
detail
and
told
what
the
doctor
had
said
they
sat
silent
for
a
while
in
that
tense
atmosphere
which
seems
to
stifle
vitality
in
a
house
of
dangerous
sickness
overhead
the
nurse
moved
about
making
the
window
rattle
softly
now
and
then
you
have
known
uncle
a
long
time
have
you
not
at
all
richard
answered
it
a
very
funny
thing
but
though
i
seem
to
know
him
quite
well
i
not
met
him
half
a
dozen
times
in
my
life
i
saw
him
first
about
a
year
ago
and
then
i
met
him
again
the
other
day
at
the
british
museum
and
after
we
had
dinner
together
we
were
just
like
old
friends
i
certainly
thought
from
what
he
said
that
you
old
friends
uncle
has
so
few
friends
except
one
or
two
neighbours
i
do
believe
you
are
the
first
person
that
has
ever
called
at
this
house
since
i
came
to
live
here
at
any
rate
we
have
soon
got
to
know
each
other
said
richard
smiling
it
is
a
week
since
you
asked
me
if
my
name
was
larch
she
returned
the
smile
though
rather
mechanically
perhaps
my
mistake
about
your
being
an
old
friend
of
uncle
explains
that
she
said
well
we
wo
bother
about
explaining
it
there
it
is
and
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
just
now
you
must
tell
me
thank
you
i
will
she
said
it
with
perfect
simplicity
richard
was
conscious
of
a
scarcely
perceptible
thrill
you
must
have
had
an
awful
time
last
night
all
alone
he
said
yes
but
i
was
too
annoyed
to
feel
upset
annoyed
because
uncle
has
brought
it
all
on
himself
by
carelessness
i
do
think
it
a
shame
she
stopped
rocking
and
sat
up
her
face
full
of
serious
protest
he
not
the
sort
of
man
to
take
care
of
himself
he
never
thought
that
just
it
he
should
have
thought
at
his
age
if
he
dies
he
will
practically
have
killed
himself
yes
killed
himself
there
no
excuse
going
out
as
he
did
in
spite
of
all
i
said
fancy
him
coming
downstairs
last
sunday
in
the
state
he
was
and
then
going
out
on
monday
though
it
warm
well
we
hope
he
will
get
better
and
it
may
be
a
lesson
to
him
hark
what
was
that
she
sprang
to
her
feet
apprehensively
and
listened
her
breast
pulsing
beneath
the
tight
black
bodice
and
her
startled
inquiring
eyes
fixed
on
richard
a
very
faint
tinkle
came
from
the
rear
of
the
house
perhaps
the
bell
he
suggested
of
course
how
silly
of
me
i
fancied
who
can
it
be
at
this
time
she
went
softly
into
the
passage
richard
heard
the
door
open
and
then
a
woman
voice
which
somehow
seemed
familiar
how
is
aked
your
servant
told
our
servant
that
he
was
ill
and
i
felt
anxious
oh
adeline
exclaimed
discomposed
for
a
moment
as
it
seemed
to
richard
then
she
went
on
coldly
uncle
is
about
the
same
thank
you
and
almost
immediately
closed
the
door
a
person
to
inquire
about
uncle
she
said
to
richard
with
a
peculiar
intonation
on
the
room
then
just
as
he
was
saying
that
he
must
go
there
was
a
knock
on
the
ceiling
and
she
flew
away
again
richard
waited
in
the
passage
till
she
came
downstairs
it
nothing
i
thought
he
was
dying
oh
and
she
began
to
cry
freely
and
openly
without
attempting
to
wipe
her
eyes
richard
gazed
hard
at
the
apron
string
loosely
encircling
her
waist
from
that
white
line
her
trembling
bust
rose
like
a
bud
from
its
calyx
and
below
it
the
black
dress
flowed
over
her
broad
hips
in
gathered
folds
he
had
never
seen
a
figure
so
exquisite
and
the
beauty
of
it
took
a
keener
poignancy
from
their
solitude
in
the
still
anxious
night
the
nurse
and
the
sick
man
were
in
another
sphere
had
you
better
go
to
bed
he
said
you
must
be
tired
out
and
how
awkward
and
conventional
the
words
sounded
chapter
xv
in
adeline
idiosyncrasy
there
was
a
subtle
elusive
suggestion
of
singularity
of
unexpectedness
which
richard
in
spite
of
himself
found
very
alluring
and
he
correctly
attributed
it
in
some
degree
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
her
early
life
an
account
of
which
with
characteristic
quaintness
she
had
given
him
at
their
second
meeting
the
posthumous
child
of
richard
aked
brother
adeline
who
had
no
recollection
of
her
mother
lived
at
first
with
her
maternal
grandparents
and
two
uncles
she
slept
alone
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
when
she
arose
in
the
morning
from
the
big
bed
with
its
red
curtains
and
yellow
tassels
she
always
ran
to
the
window
immediately
below
here
were
the
leads
which
roofed
the
great
projecting
windows
of
the
shop
it
was
her
practice
at
night
to
scatter
crumbs
on
the
leads
and
sometimes
she
would
be
early
enough
to
watch
the
sparrows
pecking
them
more
often
all
the
crumbs
had
vanished
while
she
was
yet
asleep
the
square
never
failed
to
interest
her
in
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
it
seemed
torpid
and
morose
but
before
dinner
more
especially
on
saturdays
and
mondays
it
was
gaily
alert
full
of
stalls
and
horses
and
carts
and
heaped
piles
of
vegetables
and
pigs
grunting
amidst
straw
and
rough
men
their
trousers
tied
at
the
knees
with
string
who
walked
about
heavily
cracking
whips
these
things
arrived
mysteriously
before
the
sun
and
in
the
afternoon
they
dwindled
imperceptibly
away
the
stalls
were
unthatched
the
carts
jolted
off
one
by
one
and
the
pigs
departed
squeaking
until
at
five
the
littered
square
was
left
deserted
and
forlorn
now
and
again
a
new
stall
unfolding
vivid
white
canvas
stood
out
brightly
amid
its
soiled
companions
then
adeline
would
run
downstairs
to
her
favourite
uncle
who
had
breakfast
at
so
that
he
might
be
in
charge
of
the
shop
while
the
rest
were
at
table
uncle
mark
uncle
mark
there
is
a
new
stall
up
at
the
top
of
the
square
near
the
new
inn
perhaps
it
is
only
an
old
one
with
its
face
washed
uncle
mark
would
say
and
adeline
raising
her
right
shoulder
would
put
her
head
on
it
and
laugh
screwing
up
her
eyes
in
those
days
she
was
like
a
little
puritan
girl
with
her
plain
frocks
and
prim
gait
her
black
hair
confined
by
a
semicircular
comb
which
stretched
from
ear
to
ear
over
the
top
of
her
head
was
brushed
straight
away
from
her
forehead
and
fell
across
the
entire
width
of
her
shoulders
in
glossy
wavy
lines
her
grey
eyes
were
rather
large
except
when
she
laughed
and
they
surveyed
people
with
a
frank
inquiring
look
which
frightened
some
of
the
commercial
travellers
who
came
into
the
shop
and
gave
her
threepenny
bits
it
seemed
as
if
all
one
secret
shames
stood
revealed
to
that
artless
gaze
her
nose
was
short
and
flattened
but
her
mouth
happened
to
be
perfect
of
exactly
the
classic
form
and
size
with
delectable
lips
half
hiding
the
small
white
teeth
to
her
the
house
appeared
to
be
of
immense
proportions
she
had
been
told
that
once
before
she
was
born
it
was
three
houses
certainly
it
possessed
more
than
the
usual
number
of
staircases
and
one
of
these
with
the
single
room
to
which
it
gave
access
was
always
closed
from
the
square
the
window
of
the
disused
chamber
obscured
and
bare
contrasted
strangely
with
the
clear
panes
white
blinds
and
red
pads
of
the
others
this
room
was
next
to
her
own
the
two
staircases
running
parallel
and
the
thought
of
its
dread
emptiness
awed
her
at
nights
one
saturday
night
in
bed
she
discovered
that
grandma
who
had
been
plaiting
her
hair
for
sunday
had
left
a
comb
sticking
in
it
she
called
aloud
to
grandma
to
uncle
mark
to
uncle
luke
in
vain
none
of
them
came
to
her
but
she
distinctly
heard
an
answering
cry
from
the
shut
room
she
ceased
to
call
and
lay
fearfully
quiet
for
a
while
then
it
was
morning
and
the
comb
had
slipped
out
of
her
hair
and
down
into
the
bed
beneath
the
house
were
many
cellars
one
served
for
kitchen
and
adeline
had
a
swing
there
hung
from
a
beam
two
others
were
larders
a
fourth
held
coal
and
in
a
fifth
ashes
were
thrown
there
were
yet
two
more
under
the
shop
to
be
reached
by
a
separate
flight
of
stone
steps
uncle
mark
went
down
those
steps
every
afternoon
to
turn
on
the
gas
but
he
would
never
allow
adeline
to
go
with
him
grandma
indeed
was
very
cross
if
when
the
door
leading
to
the
steps
happened
to
be
open
adeline
approached
within
a
yard
of
it
often
chattering
to
the
who
at
quiet
times
of
the
day
clustered
round
the
stove
with
their
sewing
she
would
suddenly
think
of
the
cellars
below
and
her
heart
would
seem
to
stop
if
the
shutters
were
up
the
shop
was
even
more
terribly
mysterious
than
either
the
cellars
or
the
disused
room
on
sunday
afternoons
when
grandpa
snored
behind
a
red
and
yellow
handkerchief
in
the
it
was
necessary
for
adeline
to
go
through
the
shop
and
up
the
staircase
in
order
to
reach
the
because
to
get
to
the
house
staircase
would
involve
disturbing
the
sleeper
how
strange
the
shop
looked
as
she
hurried
timorously
across
a
dim
twilight
worse
than
total
darkness
filtered
through
the
cracks
of
the
shutters
showing
faintly
the
sallow
which
covered
the
merinos
and
the
chairs
on
the
counters
and
she
always
reached
the
which
had
two
large
unobstructed
windows
with
a
sob
of
relief
very
few
customers
were
asked
into
the
adeline
employed
it
on
weekdays
as
a
nursery
here
she
nursed
her
dolls
flew
kites
and
read
little
wideawake
a
book
given
to
her
by
a
commercial
traveller
there
was
a
cheval
glass
near
the
front
window
in
which
she
contemplated
herself
long
and
seriously
she
never
had
the
companionship
of
other
children
nor
did
she
desire
it
other
children
she
understood
were
rude
and
dirty
although
uncle
mark
and
uncle
luke
taught
in
the
and
grandpa
had
once
actually
been
superintendent
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
there
simply
because
the
children
were
rude
and
dirty
but
she
went
to
morning
chapel
sitting
alone
with
grandpa
on
the
red
cushions
of
the
broad
pew
that
creaked
every
time
she
moved
uncle
mark
and
uncle
luke
sat
away
up
in
the
gallery
with
the
rude
and
dirty
children
grandma
seldom
went
to
chapel
the
ministers
called
to
see
her
instead
once
to
her
amazement
uncle
luke
had
ascended
the
pulpit
stairs
looking
just
as
if
he
was
walking
in
his
sleep
and
preached
it
seemed
so
strange
and
afterwards
the
religious
truths
which
she
had
been
taught
somehow
lost
their
awfulness
and
some
of
their
reality
on
sunday
evenings
she
celebrated
her
own
private
service
in
which
she
was
preacher
choir
organist
and
congregation
her
extempore
prayers
were
the
secret
admiration
of
grandma
who
alone
heard
them
adeline
stayed
up
for
supper
on
sundays
when
the
meal
was
over
grandpa
opened
the
big
bible
and
in
his
rich
heavy
voice
read
that
shem
begat
arphaxad
and
arphaxad
begat
salah
and
salah
begat
eber
and
eber
begat
pelag
and
about
the
ammonites
and
the
jebusites
and
the
canaanites
and
the
moabites
and
then
they
knelt
and
he
prayed
for
them
that
rule
over
us
and
widows
and
orphans
and
at
the
word
orphans
grandma
who
did
kneel
like
the
others
but
sat
upright
in
her
with
one
hand
over
her
eyes
would
say
amen
amen
under
her
breath
and
after
it
was
all
over
adeline
would
choose
whether
uncle
mark
or
uncle
luke
should
carry
her
to
bed
grandpa
died
and
then
grandma
and
aunt
grace
who
was
not
an
aunt
at
all
but
a
cousin
came
to
stay
with
adeline
and
her
uncles
and
one
day
the
shutters
of
the
shop
were
put
up
and
not
taken
down
again
adeline
learnt
that
uncle
mark
and
uncle
luke
were
going
a
long
way
off
to
america
and
that
she
was
to
live
in
future
with
aunt
grace
in
a
large
and
splendid
house
full
of
coloured
pictures
and
statues
and
books
it
seemed
odd
that
aunt
grace
whose
dresses
were
rather
shabby
should
have
a
finer
house
than
grandpa
until
uncle
mark
explained
that
the
house
did
not
really
belong
to
aunt
grace
aunt
grace
merely
kept
it
in
order
for
a
rich
young
gentleman
who
had
fifteen
servants
when
she
had
recovered
from
the
parting
with
her
uncles
adeline
accepted
the
change
with
docility
long
inured
as
she
was
to
spiritual
solitude
for
the
closest
friendship
that
can
exist
between
a
child
and
an
adult
comprises
little
more
than
an
affectionate
tolerance
on
either
side
and
certainly
knows
nothing
of
those
intimate
psychic
affinities
which
attract
child
to
child
or
man
to
man
she
could
not
indeed
have
easily
found
much
hardship
in
the
conditions
of
her
new
life
one
matter
troubled
her
at
first
namely
that
aunt
grace
never
prayed
or
read
the
bible
or
went
to
chapel
nor
so
far
as
adeline
knew
did
anyone
else
at
the
abbey
but
she
soon
became
reconciled
to
this
state
of
things
for
a
time
she
continued
to
repeat
her
prayers
then
the
habit
ceased
the
of
which
she
had
heard
a
great
deal
fascinated
her
at
once
it
was
a
long
but
not
very
lofty
apartment
receiving
daylight
from
a
hidden
source
hung
with
the
finest
examples
of
the
four
great
italian
schools
which
flourished
during
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
venetian
a
revel
of
colour
the
roman
dignified
and
even
sedate
the
florentine
nobly
grandiose
and
the
school
of
parma
mysteriously
delicate
opportunity
serving
she
spent
much
of
her
time
here
talking
busily
to
the
madonnas
the
christs
the
martyred
saints
the
monarchs
the
knights
the
lovely
ladies
and
all
the
naïve
mediæval
crowd
giving
each
of
them
a
part
in
her
own
infantile
romances
when
she
grew
older
she
copied
who
shall
say
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
the
attitudes
and
gestures
of
the
women
and
perhaps
in
time
there
passed
into
adeline
by
some
ineffable
channel
at
least
a
portion
of
their
demure
grace
and
contented
quietude
there
were
pictures
also
in
the
square
library
examples
of
quite
modern
english
and
french
work
sagaciously
chosen
by
one
whose
critical
faculty
had
descended
to
him
through
four
generations
of
collectors
but
adeline
had
no
eyes
for
these
the
books
however
gorgeous
prisoners
in
glass
were
her
good
friends
though
she
might
never
touch
them
and
though
the
narrow
conventional
girl
education
assiduously
bestowed
upon
her
by
her
aunt
in
person
stifled
rather
than
fostered
curiosity
with
regard
to
their
contents
when
adeline
was
about
nineteen
her
guardian
became
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
farmer
a
tenant
of
the
abbey
who
made
it
clear
that
in
espousing
aunt
grace
he
was
not
eager
to
espouse
aunt
grace
also
a
serious
question
arose
as
to
her
future
she
had
only
one
other
relative
in
england
aked
and
she
passively
accepted
his
timely
suggestion
that
she
should
go
to
london
and
keep
house
for
him
chapter
xvi
on
the
wednesday
evening
richard
took
tea
at
the
crabtree
so
that
he
might
go
down
by
train
to
parson
green
direct
from
charing
cross
the
was
almost
empty
of
customers
and
miss
roberts
who
appeared
to
be
in
attendance
there
was
reading
in
the
cosy
corner
an
angle
of
the
room
furnished
with
painted
mirrors
and
a
bark
bench
of
fictitious
rusticity
what
are
you
doing
up
here
he
asked
when
she
brought
his
meal
are
you
cashier
downstairs
any
longer
oh
yes
she
said
i
should
just
think
i
was
but
the
girl
that
waits
in
this
room
miss
pratt
has
her
on
wednesdays
and
i
come
here
and
the
governor
takes
my
place
downstairs
i
do
it
to
oblige
him
he
a
gentleman
he
is
polite
i
have
my
on
fridays
well
if
you
nothing
else
to
do
what
do
you
say
to
pouring
out
my
tea
for
me
ca
you
pour
it
out
yourself
poor
thing
she
smiled
pityingly
and
began
to
pour
out
the
tea
sit
down
richard
suggested
no
thank
you
she
said
there
if
it
is
sweet
enough
you
can
put
another
lump
in
yourself
and
she
disappeared
behind
the
screen
which
hid
the
presently
he
summoned
her
to
make
out
his
check
he
was
debating
whether
to
tell
her
that
aked
was
perhaps
if
he
did
so
she
might
request
to
be
informed
how
the
fact
concerned
herself
he
decided
to
say
nothing
and
was
the
more
astonished
when
she
began
did
you
know
aked
was
very
ill
yes
who
told
you
why
i
live
near
him
a
few
doors
away
did
i
tell
you
once
and
their
servant
told
ours
told
your
servant
yes
said
miss
roberts
reddening
a
little
and
with
an
inflection
which
meant
i
suppose
you
thought
family
would
have
a
servant
oh
he
stopped
a
moment
and
then
an
idea
came
to
him
it
must
have
been
you
who
called
last
night
to
inquire
he
wondered
why
adeline
had
been
so
curt
with
her
were
you
there
then
oh
yes
i
know
the
akeds
pretty
well
the
doctor
says
he
not
get
better
what
do
you
think
i
afraid
it
a
bad
lookout
very
sad
for
poor
miss
aked
is
it
she
said
and
something
in
the
tone
made
richard
look
up
at
her
yes
he
agreed
of
course
you
like
her
i
scarcely
know
her
it
the
old
man
i
know
he
replied
guardedly
well
if
you
ask
me
i
think
she
a
bit
perhaps
that
only
her
manner
you
noticed
it
too
have
you
not
a
bit
i
really
seen
very
little
of
her
going
down
again
i
may
do
nothing
had
passed
between
adeline
and
himself
as
to
his
calling
that
day
but
when
he
got
to
carteret
street
she
evidently
accepted
his
presence
as
a
matter
of
course
and
he
felt
glad
there
was
noting
in
her
demeanour
to
recall
the
scene
of
the
previous
night
he
did
not
stay
long
aked
condition
was
unchanged
adeline
had
watched
by
him
all
day
while
the
nurse
slept
and
now
she
confessed
to
an
indisposition
my
bones
ache
she
said
with
an
attempt
to
laugh
and
i
feel
miserable
though
under
the
circumstances
there
nothing
strange
in
that
he
feared
she
might
be
sickening
towards
influenza
caught
from
her
uncle
but
said
nothing
lest
he
should
alarm
her
without
cause
the
next
day
however
his
apprehension
was
justified
on
his
way
to
the
house
in
the
evening
he
met
the
doctor
at
the
top
of
carteret
street
and
stopped
him
you
a
friend
of
aked
eh
the
doctor
said
examining
richard
through
his
spectacles
well
go
and
do
what
you
can
miss
aked
is
down
with
the
influenza
now
but
i
do
think
it
will
be
a
severe
attack
if
she
takes
care
the
old
fellow
state
is
serious
you
see
he
has
no
constitution
though
perhaps
scarcely
a
disadvantage
in
these
cases
but
when
it
comes
to
double
basic
pneumonia
with
fever
and
cardiac
complications
pulse
respiration
temperature
to
there
not
a
great
deal
of
chance
i
got
a
magnificent
nurse
though
and
she
have
her
hands
full
we
ought
really
to
send
for
another
one
especially
as
miss
aked
wants
looking
after
too
bless
you
he
went
on
in
answer
to
a
question
from
richard
i
ca
say
i
injected
strychnia
this
morning
and
that
has
given
relief
but
he
may
die
during
the
night
on
the
other
hand
he
may
recover
by
the
way
they
seem
to
have
no
relations
except
a
cousin
of
aked
who
lives
in
the
north
i
wired
to
her
good
evening
see
what
you
can
do
i
due
in
my
surgery
in
two
minutes
richard
introduced
himself
to
the
nurse
explained
that
he
had
seen
the
doctor
and
asked
if
he
could
render
assistance
she
was
a
slender
girl
of
about
with
dark
twinkling
eyes
and
astonishingly
small
white
ears
her
blue
uniform
made
of
the
same
print
as
a
servant
fitted
without
a
crease
and
her
immense
apron
was
snowy
on
one
linen
cuff
was
a
stain
she
noticed
this
while
talking
to
richard
and
adroitly
reversed
the
wristband
under
his
very
gaze
i
suppose
you
know
the
akeds
pretty
well
she
questioned
well
pretty
well
he
answered
do
you
know
any
friends
of
theirs
women
who
happen
to
live
near
i
feel
fairly
sure
they
have
practically
no
acquaintances
i
have
never
met
any
people
here
it
is
very
awkward
now
that
miss
aked
is
taken
the
mention
of
adeline
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
make
more
particular
inquiries
as
to
her
condition
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
the
nurse
said
only
she
must
stay
in
bed
and
keep
quite
quiet
i
fancied
last
night
she
looked
ill
he
said
sagely
you
were
here
last
night
yes
and
the
night
before
oh
i
was
aware
the
nurse
stopped
a
moment
pardon
me
if
i
am
indiscreet
but
are
you
engaged
to
miss
aked
no
said
richard
shortly
uncertain
whether
or
not
he
was
blushing
the
nurse
eyes
twinkled
but
otherwise
her
impassive
gravity
suffered
no
diminishment
not
at
all
he
added
i
am
merely
a
friend
anxious
to
do
anything
i
can
i
will
get
you
to
do
some
marketing
for
me
she
decided
suddenly
the
maid
is
sitting
with
aked
he
a
little
easier
for
the
moment
and
miss
aked
i
think
is
asleep
if
i
give
you
a
list
can
you
discover
the
shops
i
am
quite
ignorant
of
this
neighbourhood
richard
thought
he
could
discover
the
shops
in
the
meantime
i
will
have
a
bath
i
have
had
no
rest
worth
mentioning
for
hours
and
i
want
freshening
up
do
come
back
for
twenty
minutes
or
there
will
be
no
one
to
let
you
in
stay
i
will
give
you
the
it
was
attached
to
her
chatelaine
equipped
with
written
orders
and
a
sovereign
he
went
out
though
he
was
away
barely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
was
dressed
and
downstairs
again
when
he
came
in
her
face
as
radiant
as
if
she
had
just
risen
she
counted
the
change
and
checked
the
different
purchases
with
the
list
richard
had
made
no
mistakes
thank
you
she
said
very
formally
he
had
expected
a
little
praise
is
there
anything
else
i
can
do
he
asked
determined
not
to
weary
in
good
works
however
coldly
his
efforts
were
received
i
think
you
might
sit
with
aked
for
a
while
she
said
i
must
positively
give
some
attention
to
miss
aked
and
half
an
hour
rest
would
not
harm
me
see
there
are
some
slippers
would
you
mind
taking
off
your
boots
and
putting
those
on
instead
thank
you
you
may
talk
to
aked
if
he
talks
to
you
and
let
him
hold
your
hand
he
probably
want
to
let
him
have
just
a
sip
of
the
brandy
and
milk
i
will
give
you
whenever
he
asks
for
it
do
mind
if
he
grumbles
at
everything
you
do
try
to
soothe
him
remember
he
is
very
seriously
shall
i
take
you
upstairs
she
looked
at
richard
and
then
at
the
door
and
richard
hesitating
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
stepped
past
her
to
open
it
he
managed
it
awkwardly
because
he
had
never
done
such
a
thing
for
a
lady
in
his
life
nor
could
he
quite
understand
what
mysterious
prompting
had
led
him
to
be
so
punctilious
now
the
nurse
bowed
acknowledgment
and
preceded
him
to
the
he
felt
as
a
student
feels
just
before
the
examination
papers
are
handed
round
a
smell
of
linseed
escaped
from
the
bedroom
as
the
nurse
pushed
open
the
door
stay
outside
a
moment
she
said
to
richard
he
could
see
the
grate
on
which
a
kettle
was
singing
over
a
small
fire
in
front
of
the
fire
was
a
board
with
a
large
bowl
and
spoon
and
some
pieces
of
linen
then
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
loud
sound
of
rapid
painful
breathing
accompanied
by
moans
and
a
strange
rattling
which
came
to
his
ears
with
perturbing
distinctness
he
knew
nothing
of
sickness
beyond
what
people
had
told
him
and
these
phenomena
inspired
him
with
physical
dread
he
wished
to
run
away
a
friend
of
yours
is
coming
to
sit
with
you
aked
you
know
larch
he
heard
the
nurse
say
she
was
evidently
busy
about
the
bed
you
can
go
now
lottie
she
went
on
to
the
servant
wash
up
the
things
i
have
put
in
the
sink
and
then
off
to
bed
richard
waited
with
painful
expectancy
for
the
voice
of
aked
larch
did
you
say
why
did
he
come
before
the
tones
were
less
unnatural
than
he
had
anticipated
but
it
seemed
that
only
by
the
exercise
of
a
desperate
ingenuity
could
the
speaker
interject
the
fragments
of
a
sentence
here
and
there
between
his
hurrying
gasps
then
the
servant
went
downstairs
come
in
larch
the
nurse
called
pleasantly
the
patient
supported
by
pillows
was
sitting
upright
in
bed
and
as
richard
entered
he
looked
towards
the
door
with
the
expression
of
an
unarmed
man
on
the
watch
for
an
assassin
his
face
was
drawn
and
duskily
pale
but
on
each
cheek
burned
a
red
flush
at
every
cruel
inspiration
the
nostrils
dilated
widely
and
the
shoulders
were
raised
in
a
frenzied
effort
to
fill
the
embarrassed
lungs
well
aked
richard
greeted
him
here
i
am
you
see
he
made
no
reply
beyond
a
weak
nod
and
signed
to
the
nurse
for
the
of
brandy
and
milk
which
she
held
to
his
mouth
richard
was
afraid
he
might
not
be
able
to
stay
in
the
room
and
marvelled
that
the
nurse
could
be
unmoved
and
cheerful
in
the
midst
of
this
piteous
altercation
with
death
was
she
blind
to
the
terror
in
the
man
eyes
you
had
better
sit
here
larch
she
said
quietly
pointing
to
a
chair
by
the
bedside
here
is
the
drink
hold
the
cup
so
ring
this
bell
if
you
want
me
for
anything
then
she
noiselessly
disappeared
no
sooner
had
he
sat
down
than
aked
seized
his
shoulder
for
support
and
each
movement
of
the
struggling
frame
communicated
itself
to
richard
body
richard
suddenly
conceived
a
boundless
respect
for
the
nurse
who
had
watched
whole
nights
by
this
tortured
organism
on
the
bed
somehow
existence
began
to
assume
for
him
a
new
and
larger
aspect
he
felt
that
till
that
moment
he
had
been
going
through
the
world
with
his
eyes
closed
life
was
sublimer
more
terrible
than
he
had
thought
he
abased
himself
before
all
doctors
and
nurses
and
soldiers
in
battle
they
alone
tasted
the
true
savour
of
life
art
was
a
very
little
thing
presently
aked
breathed
with
slightly
less
exertion
and
he
appeared
to
doze
for
a
few
moments
now
and
then
though
richard
could
scarcely
believe
that
any
semblance
of
sleep
was
possible
to
a
man
in
his
condition
adeline
he
questioned
once
she
getting
on
fine
richard
said
soothingly
would
you
like
a
sip
he
put
his
grey
lips
clumsily
round
the
lip
of
the
cup
drank
and
then
pushed
the
vessel
away
with
a
gesture
of
irritation
the
windows
were
open
but
the
air
was
perfectly
still
and
the
gas
burnt
without
a
tremor
between
the
windows
and
the
door
i
stifled
the
patient
gasped
are
they
doing
all
they
can
for
me
richard
tried
to
reassure
him
it
all
over
with
me
larch
i
ca
keep
it
up
long
going
going
they
have
to
try
something
else
his
lustrous
eyes
were
fastened
on
richard
with
an
appealing
gaze
richard
turned
away
i
frightened
i
thought
i
should
be
but
i
am
doctor
suggested
parson
it
not
that
i
said
no
do
you
think
i
dying
not
a
bit
said
richard
that
a
lie
i
off
it
a
big
thing
death
afraid
of
it
at
last
instinct
shows
there
something
awful
behind
it
if
richard
had
been
murdering
the
man
he
could
not
have
had
a
sharper
sense
of
guilt
than
at
that
moment
oppressed
him
aked
continued
to
talk
but
with
a
growing
incoherence
which
gradually
passed
into
delirium
richard
looked
at
his
watch
only
thirty
minutes
had
slipped
by
and
yet
he
felt
as
if
his
shoulder
had
suffered
the
clutch
of
that
hot
hand
since
before
the
beginning
of
time
again
he
experienced
the
disconcerting
sensation
of
emotional
horizons
suddenly
widened
people
were
walking
down
the
street
they
talked
and
laughed
how
incongruously
mirthful
and
careless
their
voices
sounded
perhaps
they
had
never
watched
by
a
never
listened
to
the
agonised
breathing
of
a
pneumonia
patient
that
incessant
frantic
intake
of
air
it
exasperated
him
if
it
did
not
stop
soon
he
should
go
mad
he
stared
at
the
and
the
grew
larger
larger
till
he
could
see
nothing
else
then
after
a
long
while
surely
the
breathing
was
more
difficult
there
was
a
reverberating
turmoil
in
the
man
chest
which
shook
the
bed
could
richard
have
been
asleep
or
what
he
started
up
but
aked
clung
desperately
to
him
raising
his
shoulders
higher
and
higher
in
the
struggle
to
inhale
and
leaning
forward
till
he
was
bent
almost
double
richard
hesitated
and
then
struck
the
bell
it
seemed
as
if
the
nurse
would
never
come
the
door
opened
softly
i
afraid
he
is
much
worse
richard
said
to
the
nurse
striving
to
cover
his
agitation
she
looked
at
aked
perhaps
you
had
better
fetch
the
doctor
when
he
returned
aked
was
lying
back
unconscious
of
course
the
doctor
can
do
nothing
now
said
the
nurse
calmly
answering
the
question
in
his
eyes
he
never
speak
any
more
but
miss
aked
it
ca
be
helped
i
shall
say
nothing
to
her
till
morning
then
she
wo
see
him
certainly
not
it
would
be
madness
for
her
to
leave
her
bed
the
doctor
arrived
and
the
three
talked
quietly
together
about
the
alarming
prevalence
of
influenza
at
that
time
of
the
year
and
the
fatal
results
of
carelessness
i
tell
you
honestly
the
doctor
said
i
so
overworked
that
i
should
be
quite
satisfied
to
step
into
my
coffin
and
not
wake
again
i
had
three
midwifery
cases
this
week
forceps
chloroform
and
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
on
the
top
of
all
this
influenza
and
about
sick
of
it
that
the
worst
of
our
trade
it
comes
in
lumps
what
do
you
say
nurse
chapter
xvii
the
nurse
suggested
that
richard
should
remain
at
carteret
street
for
the
rest
of
the
night
using
the
sofa
in
the
contrary
to
his
expectation
he
slept
well
and
dreamlessly
for
several
hours
and
woke
up
refreshed
and
energetic
the
summer
sun
was
dispersing
a
light
mist
one
thought
occupied
his
mind
adeline
isolation
and
need
of
succour
mentally
he
enveloped
her
with
tender
solicitude
and
the
prospect
of
giving
her
instant
aid
and
so
earning
her
gratitude
contributed
to
a
mood
of
vigorous
cheerfulness
to
which
his
sorrow
for
aked
death
formed
but
a
vague
and
distant
background
no
one
seemed
to
be
stirring
he
washed
luxuriously
in
the
little
scullery
and
then
silently
unbolting
the
front
door
went
out
for
a
walk
it
was
just
six
and
above
the
weazen
trees
which
line
either
side
of
carteret
street
the
sparrows
were
noisily
hilarious
as
he
strode
along
in
the
fresh
sunny
air
his
fancy
pictured
scene
after
scene
between
himself
and
adeline
in
which
he
rendered
a
man
help
and
she
offered
a
woman
gratitude
he
determined
to
take
upon
himself
all
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
and
looked
forward
pleasurably
to
activities
from
which
under
different
circumstances
he
would
have
shrunk
with
dismay
he
thought
of
adeline
aunt
or
cousin
distant
in
the
north
and
wondered
whether
she
or
any
other
relatives
if
such
existed
would
present
themselves
he
hoped
that
adeline
might
be
forced
to
rely
solely
on
him
a
milkboy
who
passed
with
his
rattling
cans
observed
richard
talking
rapidly
to
no
visible
person
and
turned
round
to
stare
when
he
got
back
to
the
house
he
noticed
that
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
in
the
lottie
the
servant
was
cleaning
the
step
her
eyes
were
red
with
crying
is
nurse
up
yet
he
asked
her
yes
sir
she
in
the
kitchen
the
girl
whimpered
he
sprang
over
the
wet
step
into
the
passage
as
his
glance
fell
on
the
stairs
leading
up
to
the
room
where
lay
the
body
of
aked
separated
from
the
unconscious
adeline
only
by
a
gimcrack
wall
of
lath
and
plaster
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
awe
took
hold
of
him
death
was
very
incurable
and
he
had
been
assisting
at
a
tragedy
how
unreal
and
distorted
seemed
the
events
of
a
few
hours
before
he
had
a
curious
sense
of
partnership
in
shame
as
if
he
and
the
nurse
and
the
doctor
had
last
night
done
adeline
an
injury
and
were
conspiring
to
hide
their
sin
what
would
she
say
when
she
knew
that
her
uncle
was
dead
what
would
be
her
plans
it
occurred
to
him
now
that
she
would
of
course
act
quite
independently
of
himself
it
was
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
he
comparatively
a
stranger
could
stand
to
her
in
the
place
of
kith
and
kin
he
had
been
dreaming
he
was
miserably
disheartened
he
made
his
way
to
the
kitchen
and
pushing
the
door
open
quietly
found
the
nurse
engaged
in
cooking
a
meal
may
i
come
in
nurse
yes
mr
larch
you
seem
to
have
taken
charge
of
the
house
he
said
admiring
her
quick
neat
movements
she
was
as
much
at
home
as
if
the
kitchen
had
been
her
own
we
often
find
it
necessary
she
smiled
nurses
have
to
be
ready
for
most
things
do
you
prefer
tea
or
coffee
for
breakfast
surely
you
are
getting
breakfast
for
me
i
could
have
had
something
in
town
surely
i
am
she
said
if
you
are
fastidious
i
make
tea
miss
aked
has
had
a
moderately
good
night
i
told
her
she
took
it
very
well
said
she
expected
it
of
course
there
a
lot
to
be
done
but
i
ca
bother
her
yet
we
ought
to
have
a
telegram
from
hopkins
her
aunt
this
morning
i
wish
you
would
give
miss
aked
a
message
from
me
richard
broke
in
tell
her
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
after
things
the
funeral
you
know
and
so
on
if
she
cares
i
can
easily
arrange
to
take
a
holiday
from
the
office
i
am
sure
that
would
relieve
her
from
a
lot
of
anxiety
the
nurse
said
appreciatively
to
hide
a
certain
confusion
richard
suggested
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
lay
the
cloth
in
the
and
she
told
him
he
would
find
it
in
a
drawer
in
the
sideboard
he
wandered
off
speculating
upon
adeline
probable
answer
to
his
proposal
soon
he
heard
the
rattling
of
cups
and
saucers
and
the
nurse
footstep
on
the
stair
he
laid
the
cloth
putting
the
cruet
in
the
middle
and
the
at
opposite
corners
and
then
sat
down
in
front
of
the
case
of
french
books
to
scan
their
titles
but
he
saw
nothing
save
a
blur
of
yellow
after
a
long
time
the
nurse
came
down
again
miss
aked
says
she
can
not
thank
you
enough
she
will
leave
everything
to
you
everything
she
is
very
much
obliged
indeed
she
does
think
hopkins
will
be
able
to
travel
because
of
her
rheumatism
and
there
is
no
one
else
here
is
the
key
of
aked
desk
and
some
other
keys
there
should
be
about
in
gold
in
the
cash
box
and
perhaps
some
notes
he
took
the
keys
feeling
profoundly
happy
i
shall
just
go
up
to
the
office
first
he
decided
and
arrange
to
get
off
and
then
come
down
here
again
i
suppose
you
will
stay
on
till
miss
aked
is
better
oh
of
course
she
will
be
in
bed
several
days
yet
probably
she
might
be
able
to
sit
up
an
hour
or
two
the
day
after
in
her
own
room
it
would
do
for
me
to
see
her
i
think
not
she
is
very
weak
no
you
must
act
on
your
own
responsibility
he
and
the
nurse
had
breakfast
together
talking
with
the
freedom
of
old
friends
he
told
her
all
he
knew
of
the
akeds
not
forgetting
to
mention
that
aked
and
himself
were
to
have
collaborated
in
a
book
when
richard
let
this
out
she
showed
none
of
those
signs
of
timid
reverence
which
the
laity
are
wont
to
exhibit
in
the
presence
of
literary
people
indeed
she
said
politely
and
then
after
a
little
pause
i
actually
write
verses
myself
sometimes
you
do
and
are
they
published
oh
yes
but
perhaps
not
on
their
merits
you
see
my
father
has
influence
a
journalist
is
he
perhaps
she
laughed
at
the
idea
and
mentioned
the
name
of
a
novelist
and
you
prefer
nursing
to
writing
richard
ejaculated
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
announcement
to
anything
in
the
world
that
is
why
i
am
a
nurse
why
should
i
depend
on
my
father
or
my
father
reputation
i
admire
you
for
not
doing
so
richard
replied
hitherto
he
had
only
read
about
such
women
and
had
questioned
if
they
really
existed
he
grew
humble
before
her
recognising
a
stronger
spirit
yet
her
somehow
chafed
him
and
he
directed
his
thoughts
to
adeline
feminine
trustfulness
with
a
slight
sense
of
relief
the
funeral
took
place
on
sunday
richard
found
the
formalities
to
be
fewer
and
simpler
than
he
had
expected
and
no
difficulties
arose
of
any
kind
hopkins
as
adeline
had
foreseen
was
unable
to
come
but
she
sent
a
long
letter
full
of
advice
and
offering
her
niece
a
temporary
home
adeline
had
not
yet
been
allowed
to
leave
her
bed
but
on
the
sunday
morning
the
nurse
had
said
that
she
might
sit
up
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
and
would
like
to
see
richard
then
he
returned
to
carteret
street
on
foot
when
the
funeral
was
over
you
are
glad
it
is
all
finished
the
nurse
said
yes
he
answered
a
little
wearily
his
mind
had
dwelt
on
aked
that
day
and
the
lonely
futility
of
the
man
life
had
touched
him
with
chill
depressing
effect
moreover
now
it
came
to
the
point
he
rather
dreaded
than
desired
that
first
interview
with
adeline
after
her
uncle
death
he
feared
that
despite
any
service
he
had
rendered
they
were
not
much
more
than
acquaintances
he
morbidly
conjectured
what
she
would
say
to
him
and
how
he
would
reply
but
he
was
glad
when
the
nurse
left
him
alone
at
the
door
of
adeline
room
he
knocked
rather
louder
than
he
had
intended
and
after
hesitating
a
second
walked
in
adeline
was
seated
in
an
armchair
near
the
window
fully
dressed
in
black
with
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
her
back
was
towards
him
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
writing
a
letter
on
her
knee
she
looked
round
suddenly
as
the
door
opened
and
gave
a
little
oh
at
the
same
time
lifting
her
hands
her
face
was
pale
her
hair
flat
and
her
eyes
large
and
glittering
he
went
up
to
her
mr
larch
she
held
his
hand
in
her
thin
white
one
with
a
soft
weak
pressure
silently
gazing
at
him
while
tears
gathered
in
her
upturned
eyes
richard
trembled
in
every
part
of
his
body
he
could
not
speak
and
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
him
larch
you
have
been
very
kind
i
shall
never
be
able
to
thank
you
i
hope
you
wo
bother
about
any
thanks
he
said
are
you
better
and
yet
he
wished
her
to
say
more
with
apparent
reluctance
she
loosed
his
hand
and
he
sat
down
near
her
what
should
i
have
done
without
you
tell
me
about
you
ca
think
how
relieved
i
am
now
that
it
is
over
the
funeral
i
mean
he
said
there
was
nothing
to
tell
were
there
many
other
funerals
yes
a
lot
he
answered
her
questions
one
after
another
she
seemed
to
be
interested
in
the
least
detail
but
neither
of
them
mentioned
the
dead
man
her
eyes
seldom
left
him
when
he
suggested
that
she
must
dismiss
him
as
soon
as
she
felt
tired
she
laughed
and
replied
that
she
was
not
likely
to
be
tired
for
a
very
long
while
and
that
he
must
have
tea
with
her
and
nurse
i
was
writing
to
my
two
uncles
in
san
francisco
when
you
came
in
she
said
they
will
be
terribly
upset
about
me
at
first
poor
fellows
but
i
have
told
them
how
kind
you
have
been
and
uncle
mark
always
used
to
say
i
had
plenty
of
sense
so
that
ought
to
ease
their
minds
she
smiled
of
course
you
have
made
no
definite
plans
yet
he
asked
no
i
settle
anything
at
present
i
want
to
consult
you
about
several
things
but
some
other
time
when
i
am
better
i
shall
have
enough
money
i
think
that
is
one
solid
comfort
my
aunt
grace
hopkins
has
asked
me
to
go
and
stay
with
her
somehow
i
do
want
to
go
you
think
it
queer
of
me
i
daresay
but
i
would
really
prefer
to
stop
in
london
he
noticed
that
she
said
nothing
as
to
joining
her
uncles
in
san
francisco
i
fancy
i
shall
like
london
she
went
on
when
i
know
it
you
are
thinking
then
of
going
to
san
francisco
he
waited
apprehensively
for
her
answer
she
hesitated
it
is
so
far
i
do
quite
know
how
my
uncles
are
situated
evidently
for
some
reason
she
had
no
desire
to
leave
london
immediately
he
was
very
content
having
feared
that
she
might
pass
at
once
away
from
him
they
had
tea
on
a
little
round
the
cramped
space
and
the
consequent
necessity
of
putting
spare
plates
of
cake
on
the
bed
caused
some
amusement
but
in
the
presence
of
the
strong
brusque
nurse
adeline
seemed
to
withdraw
within
herself
and
the
conversation
such
as
it
was
depended
on
the
other
two
i
have
been
telling
miss
aked
the
nurse
said
after
tea
was
over
that
she
must
go
to
the
seaside
for
a
week
or
two
it
will
do
her
an
immense
deal
of
good
what
she
needs
most
of
all
is
change
i
suggested
littlehampton
it
is
rather
a
quiet
spot
not
too
quiet
there
is
nice
river
scenery
and
a
quaint
old
port
and
quantities
of
lovely
rustic
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
it
would
certainly
be
a
good
thing
richard
agreed
but
adeline
said
rather
petulantly
that
she
did
not
wish
to
travel
and
the
project
was
not
discussed
further
he
left
soon
afterwards
the
walk
home
seemed
surprisingly
short
and
when
he
got
to
raphael
street
he
could
remember
nothing
of
the
thoroughfares
through
which
he
had
passed
vague
delicious
fancies
flitted
through
his
head
like
fine
lines
half
recalled
from
a
great
poem
in
his
room
there
was
a
smell
from
the
lamp
and
the
windows
were
shut
tight
poor
old
landlady
he
murmured
benignantly
when
will
she
learn
to
leave
the
windows
open
and
not
to
turn
down
the
lamp
having
unfastened
one
of
the
windows
he
extinguished
the
lamp
and
went
out
on
to
the
little
balcony
it
was
a
warm
evening
with
a
cloudy
sky
and
a
gentle
tepid
breeze
the
noise
of
omnibuses
and
cabs
came
even
and
regular
from
brompton
road
and
occasionally
a
hansom
passed
up
raphael
street
he
stood
leaning
on
the
front
of
the
balcony
till
the
air
of
traffic
had
declined
to
an
infrequent
rumble
his
thoughts
a
smiling
whirling
medley
impossible
to
analyze
or
describe
at
last
he
came
in
and
leaving
the
window
ajar
undressed
slowly
without
a
light
and
lay
down
he
had
no
desire
to
sleep
nor
did
he
attempt
to
do
so
not
for
a
ransom
would
he
have
parted
with
the
fine
full
consciousness
of
life
which
thrilled
through
every
portion
of
his
being
the
brief
summer
night
came
to
an
end
and
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
he
dozed
a
little
and
then
got
up
without
a
trace
of
fatigue
he
went
to
the
balcony
again
and
drank
in
all
the
sweet
invigorating
freshness
of
the
morning
the
sunlit
streets
were
enveloped
in
an
enchanted
silence
chapter
xviii
nearly
three
weeks
later
came
the
following
letter
from
adeline
in
the
meanwhile
she
had
had
a
rather
serious
relapse
and
he
had
seen
her
only
once
or
twice
for
a
few
minutes
my
dear
larch
this
time
i
am
sure
i
am
well
again
nurse
is
obliged
to
leave
as
she
is
wanted
at
a
hospital
and
she
has
persuaded
me
to
go
to
littlehampton
and
given
me
the
address
of
some
rooms
i
shall
leave
victoria
wednesday
by
the
train
lottie
will
go
with
me
and
the
house
will
be
locked
up
for
the
present
if
i
do
see
you
we
shall
not
stay
more
than
a
week
or
ten
days
i
will
write
to
you
from
littlehampton
ever
yours
most
gratefully
a
i
was
expecting
you
down
i
do
see
you
he
repeated
to
himself
smiling
and
examining
adeline
caligraphy
which
he
had
not
seen
before
it
was
a
bold
but
not
distinguished
hand
he
read
the
note
several
times
then
folded
it
carefully
and
put
it
in
his
by
reason
of
an
unexpected
delay
at
the
office
he
almost
missed
her
at
victoria
the
train
was
due
out
at
least
a
minute
before
he
rushed
into
the
station
fortunately
trains
are
not
invariably
prompt
adeline
was
leaning
from
a
carriage
window
to
hand
a
penny
to
a
newspaper
boy
the
boy
dropped
the
penny
and
she
laughed
she
wore
a
black
hat
with
a
veil
her
cheeks
were
a
little
fuller
and
her
eyes
less
unnaturally
brilliant
at
any
rate
under
the
veil
and
richard
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
pretty
there
it
is
silly
boy
there
she
was
saying
as
he
came
up
i
thought
i
just
see
if
you
were
all
right
he
panted
i
should
have
been
here
earlier
only
i
was
detained
how
kind
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
she
said
taking
his
hand
and
fixing
her
eyes
intently
on
his
the
guard
came
along
to
fasten
the
doors
luggage
all
in
richard
asked
yes
thanks
lottie
saw
to
it
while
i
got
the
tickets
i
find
she
is
quite
an
experienced
traveller
at
which
lottie
effaced
in
a
corner
blushed
well
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourself
the
whistle
sounded
and
the
train
jerked
forward
adeline
began
to
wave
a
i
see
there
a
sunday
league
trip
to
littlehampton
on
sunday
he
said
walking
along
with
the
train
oh
do
come
down
you
like
me
to
very
much
i
will
then
send
me
the
address
she
gave
a
succession
of
little
nods
as
the
train
carried
her
away
chapter
xix
richard
eye
travelled
expectantly
over
the
tanned
crowd
of
men
in
flannels
and
gaily
attired
girls
which
lined
the
platform
of
littlehampton
station
but
adeline
was
not
to
be
seen
he
felt
somewhat
disappointed
and
then
decided
that
he
liked
her
the
better
for
not
having
come
to
meet
him
besides
he
thought
the
train
being
a
special
is
not
in
the
and
she
would
not
know
when
it
was
due
her
lodging
was
in
a
long
monotonous
terrace
which
ran
at
right
angles
to
the
seashore
turning
its
back
upon
the
river
noon
was
at
hand
and
the
fierce
rays
of
the
unclouded
sun
were
untempered
by
any
breeze
the
street
lay
hushed
for
everyone
was
either
at
church
or
on
the
sands
in
response
to
his
inquiry
the
landlady
said
that
miss
aked
was
out
and
had
left
a
message
that
if
a
gentleman
called
he
was
to
follow
her
to
the
jetty
obeying
the
directions
given
to
him
richard
soon
found
himself
by
the
banks
of
the
swift
arun
with
the
jetty
some
distance
in
front
and
beyond
that
the
sea
which
shimmered
blindly
in
the
heat
throngs
of
respectably
dressed
people
wandered
up
and
down
and
a
low
languid
murmur
of
conversation
floated
out
as
it
were
from
the
cavities
of
a
thousand
parasols
perspiring
children
whose
hands
were
chafed
by
gloves
full
of
creases
ran
to
and
fro
among
the
groups
shouting
noisily
and
heedless
of
the
frequent
injunction
to
remember
what
day
it
was
here
and
there
nurses
pushing
perambulators
made
cool
spots
of
whiteness
in
the
confusion
of
colour
on
the
river
boats
and
small
yachts
were
continually
sweeping
towards
the
sea
on
the
ebbing
tide
now
and
then
a
crew
of
boys
would
attempt
to
pull
a
skiff
against
the
rapid
current
persevere
for
a
few
strokes
and
then
amid
scoffs
from
the
bank
ignominiously
allow
themselves
to
be
whirled
past
the
jetty
with
the
other
craft
richard
had
never
seen
a
southern
before
and
he
had
fondly
expected
something
different
from
llandudno
rhyl
or
blackpool
something
less
stolid
and
more
continental
littlehampton
fell
short
of
his
anticipations
it
was
unpicturesque
as
a
manufacturing
town
and
its
summer
visitors
were
an
infestive
class
folk
garishly
clothed
and
unlearned
in
the
fine
art
of
enjoyment
the
pure
accent
of
london
sounded
on
every
side
from
the
lips
of
clerks
and
and
their
kin
richard
forgot
that
he
was
himself
a
clerk
looking
not
out
of
place
in
that
scene
presently
he
espied
a
woman
who
seemed
to
belong
to
another
sphere
she
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
jetty
and
though
a
black
and
white
sunshade
entirely
hid
her
head
and
shoulders
the
simple
perfectly
hung
black
skirt
the
neatly
shod
foot
the
small
smoothly
gloved
hand
with
thin
gold
circlet
at
wrist
sufficed
to
convince
him
that
here
by
some
strange
chance
was
one
of
those
exquisite
creatures
who
on
saturday
afternoons
drove
past
the
end
of
raphael
street
on
their
way
to
hurlingham
or
barnes
he
wondered
what
she
did
there
and
tried
to
determine
the
subtleties
of
demeanour
and
costume
which
constituted
the
plain
difference
between
herself
and
the
other
girls
on
the
jetty
at
that
moment
she
stood
erect
and
turned
round
why
she
was
quite
young
he
approached
her
it
was
adeline
astonishment
was
so
clearly
written
on
his
face
that
she
laughed
as
they
exchanged
greetings
you
seem
startled
at
the
change
in
me
she
said
abruptly
do
you
know
that
i
positively
adore
clothes
though
i
only
just
found
it
out
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
got
here
was
to
go
over
to
brighton
and
spend
terrific
sums
at
a
dressmaker
you
see
there
time
in
london
you
do
despise
me
for
it
i
hope
i
plenty
of
money
enough
to
last
a
long
long
time
she
was
dazzling
and
she
openly
rejoiced
in
the
effect
her
appearance
had
made
on
richard
you
could
have
done
better
he
answered
suddenly
discovering
with
chagrin
that
his
own
serge
suit
was
worn
and
shabby
i
relieved
she
said
i
was
afraid
my
friend
might
think
me
vain
and
extravagant
her
manner
of
saying
my
friend
half
mockery
half
deference
gave
richard
intense
satisfaction
they
walked
to
the
end
of
the
jetty
and
sat
down
on
a
stone
seat
is
it
beautiful
she
exclaimed
enthusiastically
what
the
town
or
the
people
or
the
sea
everything
i
scarcely
been
to
the
seaside
before
in
all
my
life
and
i
think
it
lovely
the
sea
would
be
splendid
if
one
could
see
it
but
it
blinds
one
even
to
glance
at
it
in
this
heat
you
shall
have
half
my
sunshade
she
put
it
over
him
with
a
protective
gesture
no
no
he
demurred
i
say
yes
why
do
men
carry
sunshades
it
only
their
pride
that
stops
them
so
you
do
like
the
town
and
the
people
well
i
love
to
see
plenty
of
people
about
and
you
would
too
if
been
fixed
like
me
i
never
seen
a
real
crowd
there
are
crushes
when
you
go
into
theatres
sometimes
are
there
yes
women
faint
but
i
should
i
would
have
given
anything
not
long
ago
to
be
in
one
of
those
crushes
now
of
course
i
can
just
please
myself
when
we
are
back
in
london
do
you
think
i
could
persuade
you
to
take
me
you
might
he
said
if
you
asked
nicely
but
young
ladies
who
wear
clothes
like
yours
do
usually
patronise
the
pit
where
the
crushes
are
stalls
or
dress
circle
would
be
more
in
your
style
i
propose
we
take
the
dress
circle
you
would
enjoy
your
crush
going
in
but
at
the
lyceum
and
some
other
theatres
there
is
quite
a
superior
crush
coming
out
of
the
stalls
and
dress
circle
yes
that
is
better
and
i
shall
buy
more
clothes
oh
i
will
be
shockingly
wasteful
if
poor
old
uncle
knew
how
his
money
was
to
be
spent
a
little
child
chased
by
one
still
less
fell
down
flat
in
front
of
them
and
began
to
cry
adeline
picked
it
up
losing
her
sunshade
and
kissed
both
children
then
she
took
a
paper
of
chocolates
from
her
pocket
and
gave
several
to
each
child
and
they
ran
away
without
saying
thank
you
have
one
she
offered
the
bag
to
richard
that
another
luxury
i
shall
indulge
in
chocolates
do
have
just
one
to
keep
me
company
she
appealed
by
the
way
about
dinner
i
ordered
dinner
for
both
of
us
at
my
rooms
but
we
can
improve
on
that
i
have
discovered
a
lovely
little
village
a
few
miles
away
angmering
all
old
cottages
and
no
drains
let
us
drive
there
in
a
victoria
and
picnic
at
a
cottage
i
know
the
exact
place
for
us
there
will
be
no
people
there
to
annoy
you
but
you
like
so
that
wo
do
at
all
i
will
do
without
for
this
day
and
what
shall
we
have
for
dinner
oh
eggs
and
bread
and
butter
and
tea
tea
for
dinner
not
very
solid
is
it
greedy
if
you
have
such
a
large
appetite
eat
a
few
more
chocolates
they
will
take
it
away
she
rose
pointing
to
a
victoria
in
the
distance
he
looked
at
her
without
getting
up
and
their
eyes
met
with
smiles
then
he
too
rose
he
thought
he
had
never
felt
so
happy
an
intoxicating
vision
of
future
felicities
momentarily
suggested
itself
only
to
fade
before
the
actuality
of
the
present
the
victoria
stopped
at
adeline
rooms
she
called
through
the
open
window
to
lottie
who
came
out
and
received
orders
to
dine
alone
or
with
the
landlady
if
she
preferred
lottie
and
bishop
are
great
friends
adeline
said
the
silly
girl
would
sooner
stay
in
to
help
bishop
with
housework
than
go
out
on
the
beach
with
me
she
must
indeed
be
silly
i
know
which
i
should
choose
it
seemed
a
remark
of
unutterable
clumsiness
after
he
had
said
it
but
faint
smile
showed
no
dissatisfaction
he
reflected
that
he
would
have
been
better
pleased
had
she
totally
ignored
it
the
carriage
ran
smoothly
along
the
dusty
roads
now
passing
under
trees
and
now
skirting
fields
whose
vivid
scarlet
almost
encroached
on
the
highway
itself
richard
lay
back
as
he
had
seen
men
do
in
the
park
his
shoulder
lightly
touching
adeline
she
talked
incessantly
though
slowly
in
that
low
voice
of
hers
and
her
tones
mingled
with
the
measured
trot
of
the
enfeebled
horse
and
lulled
richard
to
a
sensuous
quiescence
he
slightly
turned
his
face
towards
hers
and
with
dreamy
deliberateness
examined
her
features
the
dimple
in
her
cheek
which
he
had
never
noticed
before
the
curves
of
her
ear
her
teeth
her
smooth
black
hair
the
play
of
light
in
her
eye
then
his
gaze
moved
to
her
large
felt
hat
set
bewitchingly
aslant
on
the
small
head
and
then
for
a
space
he
would
look
at
the
back
of
the
imperturbable
driver
who
drove
on
and
on
little
witting
that
enchantment
was
behind
him
they
consumed
the
eggs
and
bread
and
butter
and
tea
which
adeline
had
promised
and
they
filled
their
pockets
with
fruit
that
was
idea
she
gave
herself
up
to
enjoyment
like
a
child
when
the
sun
was
less
strenuous
they
walked
about
the
village
sitting
down
frequently
to
admire
its
continual
picturesqueness
time
sped
with
astonishing
rapidity
richard
train
went
at
minutes
past
seven
and
already
as
they
stood
by
the
margin
of
the
tiny
tributary
of
the
arun
some
grandfather
clock
in
a
neighbouring
cottage
clattered
five
he
was
tempted
to
say
nothing
about
the
train
quietly
allow
himself
to
miss
it
and
go
up
by
the
first
ordinary
on
monday
morning
but
soon
adeline
inquired
about
his
return
and
they
set
off
to
walk
back
to
littlehampton
the
carriage
had
been
dismissed
he
invented
pretexts
for
loitering
made
her
sit
on
walls
to
eat
apples
tried
to
get
lost
in
protested
that
he
could
not
keep
the
pace
she
set
but
to
no
purpose
they
arrived
at
the
station
at
exactly
a
quarter
past
seven
the
platform
was
busy
and
they
strolled
to
the
far
end
of
it
and
stood
by
the
engine
i
wish
to
heaven
the
train
did
leave
so
early
he
said
i
sure
the
sea
air
would
do
me
a
lot
of
good
if
i
could
get
enough
of
it
what
a
beautiful
day
it
has
been
he
sighed
sentimentally
i
never
never
enjoyed
myself
so
perfectly
she
said
emphatically
suppose
we
beseech
the
to
lie
still
for
a
couple
of
hours
richard
smile
was
inattentive
you
are
sure
you
have
done
too
much
he
said
with
sudden
solicitude
looking
at
her
half
anxiously
i
not
a
bit
i
am
absolutely
well
again
her
eyes
found
his
and
held
them
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
mystic
messages
passed
to
and
fro
how
long
do
you
think
of
staying
not
long
it
gets
rather
boring
being
alone
i
expect
i
shall
return
on
saturday
i
was
thinking
i
would
run
down
again
on
saturday
for
the
take
a
ticket
he
said
but
of
course
if
in
that
case
i
should
stay
a
few
days
longer
i
could
allow
myself
to
deprive
you
of
the
sea
air
which
is
doing
you
so
much
good
by
next
saturday
i
may
have
discovered
more
nice
places
to
visit
perhaps
even
prettier
than
angmering
but
you
must
get
in
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
just
then
to
be
able
to
say
firmly
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
going
i
will
stay
at
a
hotel
and
take
the
first
train
but
it
required
more
decision
than
he
possessed
and
in
a
few
moments
he
was
waving
to
her
from
the
carriage
window
there
were
several
other
people
in
the
compartment
a
shy
and
her
lover
evidently
employés
of
the
same
establishment
and
an
artisan
with
his
wife
and
a
young
child
richard
observed
them
intently
and
found
a
curious
new
pleasure
in
all
their
unstudied
gestures
and
in
everything
they
said
but
chiefly
he
kept
a
watch
on
the
lover
who
made
it
no
secret
that
he
was
dwelling
in
the
seventh
heaven
richard
sympathised
with
that
man
his
glance
fell
on
him
softly
benignantly
as
the
train
passed
station
after
station
he
wondered
what
adeline
was
doing
now
and
now
and
now
on
the
following
saturday
he
took
tea
with
adeline
at
her
lodgings
the
train
had
been
late
and
by
the
time
they
were
ready
for
the
evening
walk
without
which
no
visitor
to
the
seaside
calls
the
day
complete
it
was
close
upon
nine
the
beach
was
like
a
fair
or
a
wake
conjurers
and
minstrels
each
drew
an
audience
but
the
principal
attraction
was
a
man
and
woman
who
wore
masks
and
were
commonly
supposed
to
be
distinguished
persons
to
whom
fate
had
been
unkind
they
had
a
piano
in
a
and
the
woman
sang
to
the
man
accompaniment
just
as
richard
and
adeline
came
up
the
river
of
years
was
announced
for
performance
let
us
listen
to
this
said
adeline
they
stood
at
the
rim
of
the
crowd
the
woman
had
a
rich
contralto
voice
and
sang
with
feeling
and
her
listeners
were
generous
of
both
applause
and
coppers
i
wonder
who
she
is
adeline
murmured
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
i
wonder
who
she
is
i
love
that
song
oh
probably
some
richard
said
curtly
with
a
drunken
husband
but
she
sang
beautifully
she
made
me
feel
you
know
funny
a
lovely
feeling
is
it
she
looked
up
at
him
yes
he
said
smiling
at
her
you
laughing
indeed
i
not
i
know
what
you
mean
perfectly
well
perhaps
i
had
it
just
then
too
a
little
but
the
song
is
a
bit
cheap
could
listen
to
it
every
day
and
never
get
tired
of
listening
do
you
think
that
if
a
song
gives
that
feeling
there
must
be
some
good
in
it
of
course
it
far
better
than
most
but
but
not
equal
to
those
classical
songs
you
told
me
about
the
first
time
i
saw
you
was
it
yes
schubert
was
that
the
name
i
mean
to
get
those
and
you
must
show
me
the
best
ones
and
play
the
accompaniments
and
then
i
shall
judge
for
myself
i
shall
make
an
awful
mess
of
the
accompaniments
they
not
precisely
easy
you
know
full
of
accidentals
are
they
i
like
them
then
i
never
do
like
that
sort
of
song
but
you
will
you
must
must
i
she
almost
whispered
in
tones
of
gentle
feminine
surrender
and
after
a
second
or
two
then
i
try
if
it
will
keep
you
in
a
good
temper
they
stood
fronting
the
sea
she
looked
straight
ahead
into
the
darkening
distance
and
then
turned
round
to
him
with
a
mock
plaintive
expression
and
they
both
laughed
would
it
be
better
up
by
the
river
he
suggested
where
there
are
fewer
people
a
little
to
his
surprise
she
agreed
that
it
was
certainly
rather
noisy
and
crowded
on
the
beach
on
saturday
nights
and
they
turned
their
backs
to
the
shore
the
moon
had
risen
and
shone
at
intervals
through
clouds
for
a
few
score
yards
they
walked
in
silence
then
adeline
said
it
very
dull
here
during
the
week
for
a
poor
single
woman
like
me
i
shall
go
home
on
monday
but
think
of
london
in
this
weather
i
do
think
of
it
i
think
of
the
parks
and
the
restaurants
and
the
theatres
the
good
theatres
are
closed
now
well
the
i
never
been
in
one
and
if
they
are
very
naughty
then
i
want
to
go
very
much
besides
there
are
lots
of
theatres
open
i
read
all
the
theatrical
advertisements
in
the
and
there
must
be
plenty
of
things
to
see
you
think
them
worth
seeing
but
i
should
enjoy
any
theatre
i
believe
you
would
he
said
i
used
to
be
like
that
up
to
now
i
had
no
real
pleasure
what
i
call
pleasure
and
just
going
to
have
it
i
settle
down
afterwards
did
your
uncle
take
you
out
much
i
should
say
he
did
he
took
me
to
a
concert
once
that
was
all
in
nearly
two
years
i
suppose
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
i
was
leading
a
dull
life
she
made
a
movement
with
her
hands
as
if
to
put
away
from
her
all
the
drab
dailiness
of
her
existence
in
carteret
street
you
can
soon
recover
lost
time
richard
said
cheerfully
his
fancy
was
in
the
rosy
future
vividly
picturing
the
gaieties
bohemian
unconventional
artistic
in
which
he
and
she
should
unite
he
saw
himself
and
adeline
becoming
dearer
to
each
other
and
still
dearer
her
spirit
unfolding
like
a
flower
and
disclosing
new
beauties
day
by
day
he
saw
her
eyes
glisten
when
they
met
his
felt
the
soft
pressure
of
her
hand
heard
her
voice
waver
with
tenderness
expectant
of
his
avowal
and
then
came
his
own
bold
declaration
i
love
you
adeline
and
her
warm
willing
lips
were
upon
his
god
to
dream
of
such
beatitudes
she
had
slightly
quickened
her
step
the
quays
were
silent
and
deserted
save
for
these
two
presently
masts
rose
vaguely
against
the
sky
and
they
approached
a
large
ship
richard
leaned
over
the
parapet
to
decipher
the
name
on
her
bows
juliane
he
spelt
out
that
is
norwegian
or
danish
they
lingered
a
few
moments
watching
the
movements
of
dim
figures
on
deck
listening
to
the
musical
chatter
of
an
unknown
tongue
and
breathing
that
atmosphere
of
romance
and
adventure
which
foreign
vessels
carry
with
them
from
strange
lands
then
they
walked
on
hush
exclaimed
adeline
stopping
and
touching
richard
arm
the
sailors
were
singing
some
quaint
modern
strain
what
is
it
she
asked
when
they
had
finished
a
verse
it
must
be
a
norwegian
it
reminds
me
of
grieg
another
verse
was
sung
it
began
to
rain
warm
summer
drops
you
will
be
wet
richard
said
never
mind
a
third
verse
followed
and
then
a
new
air
was
started
it
rained
faster
come
under
the
shelter
of
the
wall
here
richard
urged
timidly
taking
her
arm
i
think
i
see
an
archway
yes
yes
she
murmured
with
sweet
acquiescence
and
they
stood
together
a
long
time
under
the
archway
in
silence
while
the
norwegian
sailors
heedless
of
weather
sang
song
after
song
the
next
morning
the
sky
had
cleared
again
but
there
was
a
mist
over
the
calm
sea
they
walked
idly
on
the
level
sands
at
first
they
were
almost
alone
the
mist
intensified
distances
a
group
of
little
children
paddling
in
a
foot
of
water
appeared
to
be
miles
away
slowly
the
mist
was
scattered
by
the
sun
and
the
beach
became
populous
with
visitors
in
sunday
attire
in
the
afternoon
they
drove
to
angmering
adeline
having
found
no
preferable
haunt
you
have
no
train
to
catch
she
said
what
a
relief
shall
you
start
very
early
i
not
particular
he
answered
why
i
was
thinking
that
lottie
and
i
would
go
up
by
the
same
train
as
you
but
perhaps
you
wo
care
to
be
bothered
with
women
and
their
luggage
if
you
really
intend
to
return
i
wire
to
curpet
not
to
expect
me
till
after
lunch
and
we
go
at
a
reasonable
hour
he
left
her
at
her
lodging
as
the
clock
was
striking
eleven
but
instead
of
making
direct
for
his
hotel
he
turned
aside
to
the
river
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
juliane
curiously
it
began
to
rain
and
he
sheltered
under
the
archway
where
he
had
stood
with
adeline
on
the
previous
night
aboard
the
juliane
there
was
stir
and
bustle
he
guessed
that
the
ship
was
about
to
weigh
anchor
and
drop
down
with
the
tide
just
after
midnight
she
slid
cautiously
away
from
the
quay
to
the
accompaniment
of
hoarse
calls
and
the
rattling
of
chains
and
blocks
chapter
xx
during
the
journey
to
town
adeline
would
talk
of
nothing
but
her
intention
to
taste
all
the
amusements
which
london
had
to
offer
she
asked
numberless
questions
with
the
persistency
of
an
inquisitive
child
while
lottie
modestly
hid
herself
behind
a
copy
of
tit
bits
which
had
been
bought
for
her
now
i
will
read
out
the
names
of
the
plays
advertised
in
the
she
said
and
you
must
tell
me
what
each
is
like
and
whether
the
actors
are
good
and
the
actresses
pretty
and
things
of
that
kind
richard
entered
with
zest
into
the
conversation
he
was
in
a
boisterous
mood
and
found
her
very
willing
to
be
diverted
once
when
he
used
a
technical
term
she
stopped
him
remember
i
have
never
been
to
a
theatre
on
sunday
she
had
made
the
same
remark
several
times
it
seemed
as
if
she
liked
to
insist
on
the
point
the
morning
was
delicious
full
of
light
and
freshness
and
the
torpid
countryside
through
which
the
train
swept
at
full
speed
suggested
a
gentle
yet
piquant
contrast
to
the
urban
gaslight
themes
which
they
were
discussing
though
the
sun
shone
with
power
adeline
would
not
have
the
blinds
drawn
but
sometimes
she
used
the
newspaper
for
a
shade
or
bent
her
head
so
that
the
broad
brim
of
her
hat
might
come
between
her
eyes
and
the
sunshine
after
an
hour
the
talk
slackened
somewhat
as
richard
from
his
seat
opposite
looked
now
at
adeline
and
now
at
the
landscape
a
perfect
content
stole
over
him
he
wished
that
the
distance
to
london
could
have
been
multiplied
tenfold
and
rejoiced
in
every
delay
then
he
began
to
miss
the
purport
of
her
questions
and
she
had
to
repeat
them
he
was
examining
his
heart
is
this
love
his
thoughts
ran
do
i
actually
love
her
now
when
the
train
stopped
at
new
cross
and
richard
said
that
they
would
be
at
london
bridge
in
a
few
minutes
she
asked
when
he
would
go
down
to
carteret
street
any
time
he
said
night
he
had
hoped
she
would
fix
the
same
evening
when
is
the
to
commence
he
queried
she
laughed
vaguely
soon
suppose
i
book
seats
for
the
comedy
we
will
talk
about
it
night
it
appeared
that
her
desire
for
the
relaxations
of
town
life
had
suddenly
lost
its
instancy
immediately
he
reached
the
office
he
wrote
a
note
to
clayton
vernon
some
three
hundred
pounds
was
coming
to
him
under
the
will
of
william
vernon
and
he
had
purposed
to
let
clayton
vernon
invest
this
sum
for
him
but
the
letter
asked
that
a
cheque
for
should
be
sent
by
return
of
post
later
in
the
afternoon
he
went
to
a
tailor
in
holborn
and
ordered
two
suits
of
clothes
he
grew
restless
and
introspective
vainly
endeavouring
to
analyse
his
feeling
towards
adeline
he
wished
that
he
had
himself
suggested
that
he
should
call
on
her
that
night
instead
of
allowing
her
to
name
tuesday
when
he
got
home
he
looked
at
the
letter
which
he
had
received
from
her
a
fortnight
before
and
then
enclosing
it
in
a
clean
envelope
put
it
away
carefully
in
his
he
felt
that
he
must
preserve
all
her
letters
the
evening
dragged
itself
out
with
desolating
tedium
once
he
went
downstairs
intending
to
go
to
the
theatre
but
returned
before
he
had
unlatched
the
front
door
rowbotham
laid
his
supper
that
evening
and
he
began
to
tell
her
about
his
holiday
mentioning
with
fictitious
that
he
had
spent
it
in
the
company
of
a
young
lady
soon
he
gave
the
whole
history
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
akeds
she
warmly
praised
his
kindness
towards
adeline
my
lily
is
keeping
company
with
a
young
man
she
said
after
a
pause
a
respectable
young
chap
he
is
a
this
is
his
night
off
and
they
gone
to
the
promenade
concert
i
did
like
her
going
at
first
but
bless
you
you
have
to
give
in
young
folk
are
young
folk
all
the
world
over
but
i
must
be
getting
downstairs
again
i
have
to
do
everything
myself
ah
when
a
girl
falls
in
love
she
forgets
her
mother
it
natural
i
suppose
well
larch
it
will
be
your
turn
soon
i
hope
with
that
she
left
the
room
quickly
missing
richard
hurried
disclaimer
so
you
engaged
lily
he
said
to
the
girl
next
morning
lily
blushed
and
nodded
and
as
he
looked
at
her
eyes
he
poignantly
longed
for
the
evening
chapter
xxi
they
sat
by
the
window
and
talked
till
the
day
began
to
fade
and
the
lamplighter
had
passed
up
the
street
several
matters
of
business
needed
discussion
the
proving
of
aked
will
the
tenancy
of
the
house
and
the
opening
of
a
new
richard
who
was
acting
informally
as
legal
adviser
after
the
manner
of
clerks
towards
their
friends
brought
from
his
pocket
some
papers
for
adeline
signature
she
took
a
pen
immediately
where
do
i
put
my
name
but
you
must
read
them
first
i
should
understand
them
a
bit
she
said
and
what
is
the
use
of
employing
a
lawyer
if
one
is
put
to
the
trouble
of
reading
everything
one
signs
well
please
yourself
you
will
have
to
go
before
a
commissioner
for
oaths
and
swear
that
certain
things
are
true
be
compelled
to
read
the
affidavits
that
i
wo
i
shall
just
swear
but
you
simply
must
if
i
swear
to
fibs
it
will
be
your
fault
suppose
i
read
them
out
to
you
yes
that
would
be
nicer
but
not
now
after
supper
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
she
stood
up
and
drew
her
finger
in
fanciful
curves
across
the
richard
watched
her
with
a
smile
of
luxurious
content
it
appeared
to
him
that
all
her
movements
every
inflection
of
her
voice
her
least
word
had
the
authenticity
and
the
intrinsic
grace
of
natural
phenomena
if
she
turned
her
head
or
tapped
her
foot
the
gesture
was
right
having
the
propriety
which
springs
from
absolute
her
mere
existence
from
one
moment
to
the
next
seemed
in
some
mysterious
way
to
suggest
a
possible
solution
of
the
riddle
of
life
she
illustrated
nature
she
was
for
him
intimately
a
part
of
nature
the
great
nature
which
hides
itself
from
cities
to
look
at
her
afforded
him
a
delight
curiously
similar
to
that
which
the
townsman
derives
from
a
rural
landscape
her
face
had
little
conventional
beauty
her
conversation
contained
no
hint
either
of
intellectual
powers
or
of
a
capacity
for
deep
feeling
but
in
her
case
according
to
his
view
these
things
were
unnecessary
would
in
fact
have
been
superfluous
she
and
that
sufficed
mingled
with
the
pleasure
which
her
nearness
gave
him
there
were
subordinate
but
distinct
sensations
except
his
sister
mary
he
had
never
before
been
upon
terms
of
close
familiarity
with
any
woman
and
he
realised
with
elation
that
now
for
the
first
time
the
latencies
of
manhood
were
aroused
his
friendship
if
indeed
it
were
nothing
else
with
this
gracious
inscrutable
creature
seemed
a
thing
to
be
very
proud
of
to
gloat
upon
in
secret
to
contemplate
with
a
dark
smile
as
one
walked
along
the
street
or
sat
in
a
bus
and
then
with
a
shock
of
joyful
surprise
he
made
the
discovery
that
she
she
had
found
some
attractiveness
in
himself
their
loneliness
gave
zest
and
piquancy
to
the
situation
on
neither
side
were
there
relatives
or
friends
who
might
obtrude
or
whom
it
would
be
proper
to
consult
they
had
only
themselves
to
consider
not
a
soul
in
london
with
the
exception
of
lottie
knew
of
their
intimacy
the
visit
to
littlehampton
their
plans
for
visiting
the
theatres
her
touching
reliance
upon
him
ah
that
confiding
feminine
trust
he
read
it
frequently
in
her
glance
and
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
protective
possession
he
had
approached
no
closer
than
to
shake
her
hand
and
yet
as
he
looked
at
the
slight
frame
the
fragile
fingers
the
tufts
of
hair
which
escaped
over
her
ears
these
things
seemed
to
be
his
surely
she
had
donned
that
beautiful
dress
for
him
surely
she
moved
gracefully
for
him
talked
softly
for
him
he
left
his
chair
quietly
lighted
the
candles
at
the
piano
and
began
to
turn
over
some
songs
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
from
the
window
i
want
you
to
sing
must
i
certainly
let
me
find
something
with
an
easy
accompaniment
she
came
towards
him
took
up
a
song
opened
it
and
bade
him
look
at
it
too
difficult
he
said
abruptly
those
arpeggios
in
the
bass
i
could
possibly
play
them
she
laid
it
aside
obediently
well
this
yes
let
us
try
that
she
moved
nearer
to
him
to
miss
the
reflection
of
the
candles
on
the
paper
and
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
she
cleared
her
throat
he
knew
she
was
nervous
but
he
had
no
such
feeling
himself
ready
he
asked
glancing
round
and
up
into
her
face
she
smiled
timidly
flushing
and
then
nodded
no
she
exclaimed
the
next
second
as
he
boldly
struck
the
first
chord
i
do
think
i
sing
i
ca
oh
yes
you
will
yes
you
will
very
well
she
resigned
herself
the
first
few
notes
were
tremulous
but
quickly
she
gained
courage
the
song
was
a
mediocre
ballad
and
she
did
not
sing
with
much
expression
but
to
richard
ear
her
weak
contralto
floated
out
above
the
accompaniment
with
a
rich
passionate
quality
full
of
intimate
meanings
when
his
own
part
of
the
performance
was
not
too
exacting
he
watched
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
breast
and
thought
of
keats
sonnet
and
then
he
suddenly
quaked
in
fear
that
all
this
happiness
might
crumble
at
the
touch
of
some
adverse
fate
i
suppose
you
call
that
a
poor
song
she
said
when
it
was
finished
i
liked
it
very
much
you
did
i
am
so
fond
of
it
and
i
glad
you
like
it
shall
we
try
another
she
offered
the
suggestion
with
a
gentle
diffidence
which
made
richard
desire
to
abase
himself
before
her
to
ask
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
she
meant
by
looking
to
him
as
an
authority
a
person
whose
will
was
to
be
consulted
and
whose
humours
were
law
again
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
cleared
her
throat
and
began
to
sing
he
had
glimpses
of
mystic
emotional
deeps
in
her
spirit
hitherto
unsuspected
lottie
came
in
with
a
lamp
you
would
like
supper
adeline
said
lottie
let
us
have
supper
at
once
richard
remembered
that
when
aked
was
alive
adeline
had
been
accustomed
to
go
into
the
kitchen
and
attend
to
the
meals
herself
but
evidently
this
arrangement
was
now
altered
she
extinguished
the
candles
on
the
piano
and
took
the
with
a
question
about
schubert
supper
was
to
be
served
without
the
aid
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
she
had
been
training
lottie
that
was
clear
he
looked
round
the
furniture
was
unchanged
but
everything
had
an
unwonted
air
of
comfort
and
neatness
and
adeline
beautiful
dress
scarcely
seemed
out
of
keeping
with
the
general
aspect
of
the
room
he
gathered
that
she
had
social
aspirations
he
had
social
aspirations
himself
his
fancy
delighted
to
busy
itself
with
fine
clothes
fine
furniture
fine
food
and
fine
manners
that
his
own
manners
had
remained
inelegant
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
tireless
effort
and
vigilance
which
any
amelioration
of
their
original
crudity
would
have
necessitated
were
beyond
his
tenacity
of
purpose
the
supper
was
trimly
laid
on
a
very
white
tablecloth
and
chairs
were
drawn
up
lottie
stood
in
the
background
for
a
few
moments
adeline
called
her
for
some
trifling
service
and
then
dismissed
her
wo
you
have
some
whisky
i
know
men
always
like
whisky
at
night
she
touched
a
bell
on
the
table
the
whisky
lottie
you
forgot
it
richard
was
almost
awed
by
her
demeanour
where
could
she
have
learnt
it
he
felt
not
unlike
a
bumpkin
and
secretly
determined
to
live
up
to
the
standard
of
deportment
which
she
had
set
you
may
smoke
she
said
when
lottie
had
cleared
the
table
after
supper
i
like
it
here
are
some
cigarettes
castles
will
they
do
laughing
she
produced
a
box
from
the
sideboard
and
handed
it
to
him
he
went
to
the
sofa
and
she
stood
with
one
elbow
resting
on
the
mantelpiece
about
going
to
the
theatre
she
began
may
i
take
you
let
us
go
to
the
comedy
and
you
will
book
seats
the
dress
circle
yes
what
night
let
us
say
friday
and
now
you
may
read
me
those
documents
when
that
business
was
transacted
richard
felt
somehow
that
he
must
depart
and
began
to
take
his
leave
adeline
stood
erect
facing
him
in
front
of
the
mantelpiece
next
time
you
come
you
will
bring
those
schubert
songs
will
you
not
then
she
rang
the
bell
shook
hands
and
sat
down
he
went
out
lottie
was
waiting
in
the
passage
with
his
hat
and
stick
chapter
xxii
seven
or
eight
weeks
passed
during
that
time
richard
spent
many
evenings
with
adeline
at
the
theatre
at
concerts
and
at
carteret
street
when
they
were
going
up
to
town
he
called
for
her
in
a
hansom
she
usually
kept
him
waiting
a
few
minutes
he
sat
in
the
listening
to
the
rattle
of
harness
and
the
occasional
stamp
of
a
hoof
outside
at
length
he
heard
her
light
step
on
the
stairs
and
she
entered
the
room
smiling
proudly
she
was
wonderfully
well
dressed
with
modish
simplicity
and
exact
finish
and
she
gave
him
her
fan
to
hold
while
she
buttoned
her
long
gloves
where
she
ordered
her
gowns
he
never
had
the
least
notion
they
followed
one
another
in
rapid
succession
and
each
seemed
more
beautiful
than
the
last
all
were
sober
in
tint
the
bodices
were
and
cut
rather
low
lottie
carefully
placed
a
white
wrap
over
her
mistress
head
and
then
they
were
off
in
the
hansom
there
was
but
little
conversation
and
that
of
a
trivial
character
in
vain
he
endeavoured
to
entice
her
into
discussions
he
mentioned
books
which
he
had
read
she
showed
only
a
perfunctory
interest
he
explained
why
in
his
opinion
a
particular
play
was
good
and
another
bad
generally
she
preferred
the
wrong
one
or
at
least
maintained
that
she
liked
all
plays
and
therefore
would
not
draw
comparisons
sometimes
she
would
argue
briefly
about
the
conduct
of
certain
characters
in
a
piece
but
he
seldom
found
himself
genuinely
in
agreement
with
her
though
as
a
rule
he
verbally
concurred
in
music
she
was
a
little
less
unsympathetic
towards
his
ideals
they
had
tried
over
several
of
his
favourite
classical
songs
and
he
had
seen
in
her
face
as
she
listened
or
hummed
the
air
a
glow
answering
to
his
own
enthusiasm
she
had
said
that
she
would
learn
one
of
them
but
the
promise
had
not
been
kept
though
he
had
reminded
her
of
it
several
times
these
chagrins
however
were
but
infinitesimal
ripples
upon
the
smooth
surface
of
his
happiness
all
of
them
together
were
as
nothing
compared
to
the
sensations
which
he
experienced
in
helping
her
out
of
the
cab
in
the
full
glare
of
a
theatre
façade
invariably
he
overpaid
the
driver
handing
him
the
silver
with
an
inattentive
gesture
while
adeline
waited
on
the
steps
dainty
food
for
the
eyes
of
loiterers
and
he
offered
his
arm
and
they
passed
down
the
vestibule
and
into
the
auditorium
with
what
artless
enjoyment
she
settled
herself
in
her
seat
breathing
the
atmosphere
of
luxury
and
display
as
if
it
had
been
ozone
smiling
radiantly
at
richard
and
then
eagerly
examining
the
occupants
of
the
boxes
through
a
small
glass
she
was
never
moved
by
the
events
on
the
stage
and
whether
it
happened
to
be
tragedy
or
burlesque
at
which
they
were
assisting
she
turned
to
richard
at
the
end
of
every
act
with
the
same
happy
contented
smile
and
usually
began
to
make
remarks
upon
the
men
and
women
around
her
it
was
the
and
not
the
play
of
which
she
was
really
fond
after
the
fall
of
the
curtain
they
lingered
till
most
of
the
audience
had
gone
sometimes
they
supped
at
a
restaurant
it
is
my
turn
she
would
say
now
and
then
when
the
obsequious
waiter
presented
the
bill
and
would
give
richard
her
purse
at
first
for
form
sake
he
insisted
on
his
right
to
pay
but
she
would
not
listen
he
wondered
where
she
had
caught
the
pretty
trick
of
handing
over
her
purse
instead
of
putting
down
the
coins
and
he
traced
it
to
a
play
which
they
had
seen
at
the
vaudeville
theatre
yet
she
did
it
with
such
naturalness
that
it
did
not
seem
to
have
been
copied
the
purse
was
small
and
always
contained
several
pounds
in
gold
with
a
little
silver
the
bill
paid
he
gave
it
back
to
her
with
a
bow
then
came
the
long
rapid
drive
home
through
interminable
streets
peopled
now
only
by
hansoms
and
private
carriages
past
all
the
insolent
and
garish
splendours
of
piccadilly
clubs
into
whose
unveiled
windows
adeline
eagerly
gazed
past
the
mysterious
park
past
the
dim
solemn
squares
and
crescents
of
kensington
and
chelsea
and
so
into
the
meaner
vicinage
of
fulham
it
was
during
these
midnight
journeys
more
than
at
any
other
time
that
richard
felt
himself
to
be
a
veritable
inhabitant
of
the
city
of
pleasure
adeline
flushed
with
the
evening
enjoyment
talked
of
many
things
in
her
low
even
voice
which
was
never
raised
richard
answered
briefly
an
occasional
reply
was
all
she
seemed
to
expect
immediately
on
getting
out
of
the
cab
she
said
and
entered
the
house
alone
while
richard
directed
the
driver
back
to
raphael
street
returning
thus
solitary
he
endeavoured
to
define
what
she
was
to
him
and
he
to
her
often
when
actually
in
her
presence
he
ventured
to
ask
himself
am
i
happy
is
this
pleasure
but
as
soon
as
he
had
left
her
his
doubtfulness
vanished
and
he
began
to
long
for
their
next
meeting
little
phrases
of
hers
unimportant
gestures
came
back
vividly
to
his
memory
he
thought
how
instinct
with
charm
they
were
and
yet
was
he
really
truly
in
love
was
she
in
love
had
there
been
a
growth
of
feeling
since
that
night
at
carteret
street
after
the
holiday
at
littlehampton
he
uncomfortably
suspected
that
their
hearts
had
come
nearer
to
each
other
that
night
than
at
any
time
since
he
tried
to
look
forward
to
the
moment
when
he
should
invite
her
to
be
his
wife
but
was
that
moment
approaching
at
the
back
of
his
mind
lay
an
apprehension
that
it
was
not
she
satisfied
one
part
of
his
nature
she
was
the
very
spirit
of
grace
she
was
full
of
aplomb
and
a
delicate
tact
she
had
money
moreover
her
constant
reliance
upon
him
her
clinging
womanishness
the
caressing
humouring
tone
which
her
voice
could
assume
powerfully
affected
him
he
divined
darkly
that
he
was
clay
in
her
hands
that
all
the
future
even
the
future
of
his
own
heart
depended
entirely
upon
her
if
she
chose
she
might
be
his
goddess
and
yet
she
had
sharp
limitations
again
was
she
in
love
when
he
woke
up
of
a
morning
he
wondered
how
long
his
present
happiness
would
continue
and
whither
it
was
leading
him
a
scrap
of
conversation
which
he
had
had
with
adeline
recurred
to
him
frequently
he
had
asked
her
once
when
she
had
complained
of
ennui
why
she
did
not
become
acquainted
with
some
of
her
neighbours
i
do
care
for
my
neighbours
she
replied
curtly
but
you
ca
live
without
acquaintances
all
your
life
no
not
all
my
life
she
said
with
significant
emphasis
chapter
xxiii
they
had
been
to
the
national
gallery
it
was
saturday
afternoon
adeline
said
that
she
would
go
home
but
richard
not
without
a
little
trouble
persuaded
her
to
dine
in
town
first
he
mentioned
a
french
restaurant
in
soho
as
they
walked
up
charing
cross
road
he
pointed
out
the
crabtree
and
referred
to
the
fact
that
at
one
time
he
had
frequented
it
regularly
she
stopped
to
look
at
its
frontage
in
enamel
letters
on
the
windows
were
the
words
table
to
is
it
a
good
place
she
asked
the
best
in
london
of
that
kind
then
let
us
dine
there
i
have
often
wanted
to
try
a
vegetarian
restaurant
richard
protested
that
she
would
not
like
it
how
do
you
know
if
you
have
been
so
often
why
should
i
go
once
she
smiled
at
him
and
turned
to
cross
the
street
he
hung
back
but
i
only
went
for
economy
then
we
will
only
go
for
economy
he
dangled
before
her
the
attractions
of
the
french
restaurant
in
soho
but
to
no
purpose
he
was
loth
to
visit
the
crabtree
most
probably
miss
roberts
would
be
on
duty
within
and
he
felt
an
inscrutable
unwillingness
to
be
seen
by
her
with
adeline
at
last
they
entered
looking
through
the
glass
doors
which
lead
to
the
large
on
the
first
floor
richard
saw
that
it
was
nearly
empty
and
that
the
where
miss
roberts
was
accustomed
to
sit
was
for
the
moment
unoccupied
he
led
the
way
in
rather
hurriedly
and
selected
places
in
a
far
corner
although
it
was
scarcely
beginning
to
be
dusk
the
table
electric
lights
were
turned
on
and
their
red
shades
made
glimmering
islands
of
radiance
about
the
room
richard
kept
a
furtive
watch
on
the
presently
he
saw
miss
roberts
take
her
seat
behind
it
and
shifted
his
glance
to
another
quarter
he
was
preoccupied
and
answered
at
random
adeline
amused
queries
as
to
the
food
between
the
soup
and
the
entrée
they
were
kept
waiting
and
adeline
richard
being
taciturn
moved
her
chair
in
order
to
look
round
the
room
her
roving
eyes
stopped
at
the
left
it
and
returned
to
it
then
a
scornful
smile
albeit
scarcely
perceptible
appeared
on
her
face
but
she
said
nothing
richard
saw
her
glance
curiously
at
the
several
times
and
he
knew
too
that
miss
roberts
had
discovered
them
in
vain
he
assured
himself
that
miss
roberts
was
not
concerned
in
his
affairs
he
could
not
dismiss
a
sensation
of
uneasiness
and
discomfort
once
he
fancied
that
the
eyes
of
the
two
girls
met
and
that
both
turned
away
suddenly
when
the
dinner
was
over
and
they
were
drinking
the
coffee
for
which
the
crabtree
is
famous
adeline
said
abruptly
i
know
someone
here
oh
said
richard
with
fictitious
nonchalance
who
the
girl
at
the
roberts
her
name
is
where
have
you
met
her
he
inquired
adeline
laughed
inimically
he
was
startled
almost
shocked
by
the
harsh
mien
which
transformed
her
face
you
remember
one
night
just
before
uncle
died
she
began
bending
towards
him
and
talking
very
quietly
someone
called
while
you
and
i
were
in
the
to
inquire
how
he
was
that
was
laura
roberts
she
used
to
know
uncle
she
lives
in
our
street
he
made
love
to
her
she
did
care
for
him
but
he
had
money
and
she
encouraged
him
i
do
know
how
far
it
went
i
believe
i
stopped
it
oh
men
are
the
strangest
creatures
fancy
she
not
older
than
me
and
uncle
was
over
fifty
older
than
you
surely
richard
put
in
well
not
much
she
knew
i
could
bear
her
and
she
called
that
night
simply
to
annoy
me
what
makes
you
think
that
think
i
know
it
but
you
must
have
heard
of
the
affair
they
talk
about
it
at
your
office
i
believe
it
was
mentioned
once
he
said
hastily
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
the
same
hard
smile
richard
felt
sure
that
miss
roberts
had
guessed
they
were
talking
about
herself
and
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
them
but
he
dared
not
look
up
for
confirmation
adeline
gazed
boldly
around
her
they
were
antagonistic
these
two
women
and
richard
do
what
he
would
could
not
repress
a
certain
sympathy
with
miss
roberts
if
she
had
encouraged
aked
advances
what
of
that
it
was
no
mortal
sin
and
he
could
not
appreciate
the
reason
of
adeline
strenuous
contempt
for
her
he
saw
a
little
gulf
widening
between
himself
and
adeline
what
tremendously
red
hair
that
girl
has
she
said
later
on
yes
but
does
it
look
fine
adeline
agreed
condescendingly
when
he
paid
the
bill
on
the
way
out
miss
roberts
greeted
him
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
he
met
her
eye
steadily
and
tried
not
to
blush
as
she
checked
the
bill
with
a
tapping
pencil
he
could
not
help
remarking
her
face
amiability
candour
honesty
were
clearly
written
on
its
attractive
plainness
he
did
not
believe
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
running
after
aked
for
the
sake
of
his
money
the
tales
told
by
jenkins
were
doubtless
ingeniously
exaggerated
and
as
for
adeline
adeline
was
mistaken
good
evening
miss
roberts
said
simply
as
they
went
out
he
raised
his
hat
you
know
her
then
adeline
exclaimed
in
the
street
well
he
answered
i
been
going
there
off
and
on
for
a
year
or
two
and
one
gets
acquainted
with
the
girls
his
tone
was
rather
petulant
with
a
quick
winning
smile
she
changed
the
subject
and
he
suspected
her
of
being
artful
chapter
xxiv
i
am
going
to
america
she
said
they
sat
in
the
at
carteret
street
richard
had
not
seen
her
since
the
dinner
at
the
vegetarian
restaurant
and
these
were
almost
the
first
words
she
addressed
to
him
her
voice
was
as
tranquil
as
usual
but
he
discerned
or
thought
he
discerned
in
her
manner
a
consciousness
that
she
was
guilty
towards
him
that
at
least
she
was
not
treating
him
justly
the
blow
was
like
that
of
a
bullet
he
did
not
immediately
feel
it
really
he
questioned
foolishly
and
then
though
he
knew
that
she
would
never
return
for
how
long
are
you
going
and
how
soon
very
soon
because
i
always
do
things
in
a
hurry
i
do
know
for
how
long
it
indefinite
i
have
had
a
letter
from
my
uncles
in
san
francisco
and
they
say
i
join
them
they
ca
do
without
me
they
are
making
a
lot
of
money
now
and
neither
of
them
is
married
so
i
suppose
i
must
obey
like
a
good
girl
you
see
i
have
no
relatives
here
except
aunt
grace
you
many
never
come
back
to
england
did
she
colour
or
was
it
richard
fancy
well
i
expect
i
may
visit
europe
sometimes
it
would
do
to
give
england
up
entirely
there
are
so
many
nice
things
in
england
in
london
especially
once
in
late
boyhood
he
had
sat
for
an
examination
which
he
felt
confident
of
passing
when
the
announcement
arrived
that
he
failed
he
could
not
believe
it
though
all
the
time
he
knew
it
to
be
true
his
thoughts
ran
monotonously
there
must
be
some
mistake
there
must
be
some
mistake
and
like
a
little
child
in
the
night
he
resolutely
shut
his
eyes
to
keep
out
the
darkness
of
the
future
the
same
puerility
marked
him
now
assuming
that
adeline
fulfilled
her
intention
his
existence
in
london
promised
to
be
tragically
cheerless
but
this
gave
him
no
immediate
concern
because
he
refused
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
their
intimacy
being
severed
he
had
indeed
ceased
to
think
somewhere
at
the
back
of
the
brain
his
thoughts
lay
in
wait
for
him
for
the
next
two
hours
until
he
left
the
house
he
lived
mechanically
as
it
were
and
not
by
volition
subsisting
merely
on
a
previously
acquired
momentum
he
sat
in
front
of
her
and
listened
she
began
to
talk
of
her
uncles
mark
and
luke
she
described
them
in
detail
told
stories
of
her
childhood
even
recounted
the
common
incidents
of
her
daily
life
with
them
she
dwelt
on
their
kindness
of
heart
and
their
affection
for
herself
and
with
it
all
she
seemed
a
little
to
patronise
them
as
though
she
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
them
as
her
slaves
they
are
rather
she
said
unless
they
have
altered
since
i
heard
from
them
i
have
been
wondering
what
they
would
think
about
my
going
to
theatres
and
so
on
with
you
what
should
they
think
richard
broke
in
there
nothing
whatever
in
that
london
is
a
provincial
town
or
even
an
american
city
i
shall
tell
them
all
about
you
she
went
on
and
how
kind
you
were
to
me
when
i
scarcely
knew
you
at
all
you
could
have
been
kinder
if
you
been
my
only
cousin
say
he
laughed
awkwardly
no
really
i
quite
serious
i
never
thanked
you
properly
perhaps
i
seemed
to
take
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
he
wished
to
heaven
she
would
stop
i
disgusted
that
you
are
going
he
grumbled
putting
his
hands
behind
his
head
disgusted
in
many
ways
i
am
sorry
too
but
do
you
think
i
am
doing
the
right
thing
how
am
i
to
tell
he
returned
quickly
all
i
know
is
that
when
you
go
i
shall
be
left
all
alone
by
my
little
self
you
must
think
of
me
sometimes
in
my
lonely
garret
his
tone
was
light
and
whimsical
but
she
would
not
follow
his
lead
i
shall
often
think
of
you
she
said
musingly
scanning
intently
the
toe
of
her
shoe
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
desired
to
say
something
serious
to
justify
herself
to
him
but
could
not
gather
courage
to
frame
the
words
when
he
got
out
of
the
house
his
thoughts
sprang
forth
it
was
a
chilly
night
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
plunged
his
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
and
began
to
walk
hurriedly
heedlessly
while
examining
his
feelings
with
curious
deliberation
in
the
first
place
he
was
inexpressibly
annoyed
annoyed
that
was
the
right
word
he
could
not
say
that
he
loved
her
deeply
or
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
his
loving
her
deeply
but
she
had
become
a
delightful
factor
in
his
life
and
he
had
grown
used
to
counting
upon
her
for
society
might
he
not
in
time
conceivably
have
asked
her
to
marry
him
might
she
not
conceivably
have
consented
in
certain
directions
she
had
disappointed
him
beyond
doubt
her
spiritual
narrowness
had
checked
the
growth
of
a
passion
which
he
had
sedulously
cherished
and
fostered
in
himself
yet
in
spite
of
that
her
feminine
grace
her
feminine
trustfulness
still
exercised
a
strong
and
delicate
charm
she
was
a
woman
and
he
was
a
man
and
each
was
the
only
friend
the
other
had
and
now
she
was
going
away
the
mere
fact
that
she
found
a
future
with
her
uncles
in
america
more
attractive
than
the
life
she
was
then
leading
cruelly
wounded
his
he
then
was
nothing
to
her
after
all
he
had
made
no
impression
she
could
relinquish
him
without
regret
at
that
moment
she
seemed
above
and
beyond
him
he
was
the
poor
earthling
she
the
winged
creature
that
soared
in
freedom
now
here
now
there
giving
her
favours
lightly
and
as
lightly
withdrawing
them
one
thing
came
out
clear
he
was
an
unlucky
fellow
he
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
people
who
would
remain
to
him
in
london
when
she
had
gone
jenkins
miss
roberts
bah
how
sickeningly
commonplace
were
they
was
distinguished
she
had
an
air
a
ne
sais
which
he
had
never
observed
in
a
woman
before
he
recalled
her
gowns
her
gestures
her
turns
of
speech
all
the
instinctive
touches
by
which
she
proved
her
superiority
it
occurred
to
him
fancifully
that
there
was
a
connection
between
her
apparently
sudden
resolve
to
leave
england
and
their
visit
to
the
crabtree
and
encounter
with
miss
roberts
he
tried
to
see
in
that
incident
a
premonition
of
misfortune
what
morbid
fatuity
before
he
went
to
sleep
that
night
he
resolved
that
at
their
next
meeting
he
would
lead
the
conversation
to
a
frank
discussion
of
their
relations
and
have
it
out
with
her
but
when
he
called
at
carteret
street
two
days
later
he
found
it
quite
impossible
to
do
any
such
thing
she
was
and
gay
and
evidently
looked
forward
to
the
change
of
life
with
pleasure
she
named
the
day
of
departure
and
mentioned
that
she
had
arranged
to
take
lottie
with
her
she
consulted
him
about
a
compromise
already
effected
with
her
landlord
as
to
the
remainder
of
the
tenancy
and
said
she
had
sold
the
furniture
as
it
stood
for
a
very
small
sum
to
a
dealer
it
hurt
him
to
think
that
she
had
given
him
no
opportunity
of
actively
assisting
her
in
the
hundred
little
matters
of
business
involved
in
a
change

what
had
become
of
her
feminine
reliance
upon
him
he
felt

if
some
object
was
rapidly
approaching

collide
with
and
crush
him

the
special
train
for
southampton
drawn
up
against
the
platform
at
waterloo
seemed
to
have
resigned
itself
with
an
almost
animal
passivity
to
the
onslaught
of
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
who
were
boarding
it
from
the
engine
a
thin
column
of
steam
rose
lazily
to
the
angular
roof
where
a
few
sparrows
fluttered
with
sudden
swoops
and
short
flights
the
leaned
against
the
side

his

the
stoker
was
trimming

those
two

the
spectacle
by
heart
the
scattered
piles
of
steamer
trunks
amidst
which
passengers
hurried
hither
and
thither
with
no
apparent
object
the
continual
purposeless
opening
and
shutting
of
carriage
doors
the
deferential
gestures
of
the
glittering
guard
as
he
bent
an
ear
to
ladies
whose
footmen
stood
respectfully
behind
them
the
swift
movements
of
the
bookstall
clerk
selling
papers
and
the
meditative
look
of
the
bookstall
manager
as
he
swept
his
hand
along
the
shelf
of
new
novels
and
selected
a
volume
which
he
could
thoroughly
recommend
to
the
customer
in

colloquies
between

fathers

lovers

punctuated
sometimes
by
the
fluttering
of
a
handkerchief
or
the
placing
of
a
hand
on
a
shoulder
the
unconcealed
agitation
of
most
and
the
carefully
studied
calm
of
a
few
the
grimaces
of
porters
when
passengers
had
turned
away
the
slow
absorption
by
train
of
all
the
luggage
and
nearly
all
the
people
the
creeping
of
the
clock
towards
the
hour
the
kisses
the

lowering
of
the

them
it
was
no
more
than
a
common
richard
having
obtained
leave
from
the
office
arrived
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
he
peered
up
and
down
could
it
be
that
she
was
really
going
not
even
yet
had
he
grown
accustomed
to
the
idea
and
at
times
he
still
said
to
himself
it
is
really
true
there
must
be
some
mistake
the
moment
of
separation
now
that
it
was
at
hand
he
accused
of
having
approached
sneakingly
to
take
him
unawares
he
was
conscious
of
no
great
emotion
such
as
his
æsthetic
sense
of
fitness
might
have
led
him
to
expect
nothing
but
a
dull
joylessness
the
drab
negative
sensations
of
a
convict
foretasting
a
sentence
of
years
there
she
stood
by
the
bookstall
engaged
in
lively
talk
with
the
clerk
while
other
customers
waited
lottie
was
beside
her
holding
a
bag
the
previous
night
they
had
slept
at
morley
hotel
everything
is
all
right
i
hope
he
said
eyeing
her
narrowly
and
feeling
extremely
sentimental
yes
thank
you
lottie
you
must
go
and
keep
watch
over
our
seats
well
she
went
on
briskly
when
they
were
left
alone
i
am
actually
going
i
feel
somehow
as
if
it
ca
be
true
why
that
is
exactly
how
i
have
felt
for
days
he
answered
allowing
his
voice
to
languish
and
then
fell
into
silence
he
assiduously
coaxed
himself
into
a
mood
of
resigned
melancholy
with
sidelong
glances
as
they
walked
quietly
down
the
platform
he
scanned
her
face
decided
it
was
divine
and
dwelt
lovingly
on
the
thought
i
shall
never
see
it
again
a
dull
day
for
you
to
start
he
murmured
in
tones
of
gentle
concern
yes
and
do
you
know
a
gentleman
in
the
hotel
told
me
we
should
be
certain
to
have
bad
weather
and
that
made
me
so
dreadfully
afraid
that
i
nearly
resolved
to
stay
in
england
she
laughed
ah
if
you
would
he
had
half
a
mind
to
exclaim
but
just
then
he
became
aware
of
his
affectation
and
trampled
on
it
the
conversation
proceeded
naturally
to
the
subject
of
seasickness
and
the
little
joys
and
perils
of
the
voyage
strange
topics
for
a
man
and
a
woman
about
to
be
separated
probably
for
ever
and
yet
richard
for
his
part
could
think
of
none
more
urgent
i
had
better
get
in
now
had
i
not
she
said
the
clock
stood
at
five
minutes
to
noon
her
face
was
sweetly
serious
as
she
raised
it
to
his
holding
out
her
hand
take
care
of
yourself
was
his
fatuous
parting
admonition
her
hand
rested
in
his
own
and
he
felt
it
tighten
beneath
the
veil
the
colour
deepened
a
little
in
her
rosy
cheeks
i
did
tell
you
she
said
abruptly
that
my
uncles
had
begged
me
to
go
to
them
weeks
and
weeks
ago
i
did
tell
you
and
i
put
them
off
because
i
thought
i
would
wait
and
see
if
you
and
i
cared
for
each
other
it
had
come
the
explanation
he
blushed
red
and
stuck
to
her
hand
the
atmosphere
was
suddenly
electric
the
station
and
the
crowd
were
blotted
out
you
understand
she
questioned
smiling
bravely
yes
he
was
dimly
conscious
of
having
shaken
hands
with
lottie
of
the
banging
of
many
doors
of
adeline
face
framed
in
a
receding
window
then
the
rails
were
visible
beside
the
platform
and
he
had
glimpses
of
people
hurriedly
getting
out
of
the
train
at
the
platform
opposite
in
the
distance
the
signal
clattered
to
the
horizontal
he
turned
round
and
saw
only
porters
and
a
few
forlorn
friends
of
the
voyagers
one
woman
was
crying
instead
of
going
home
from
the
office
he
rambled
about
the
thoroughfares
which
converge
at
piccadilly
circus
basking
in
the
of
the
city
of
pleasure
he
had
four
pounds
in
his
pocket
the
streets
were
thronged
with
swiftly
rolling
vehicles
restaurants
and
theatres
and
music
halls
in
evening
array
offered
their
gorgeous
enticements
and
at
last
he
entered
the
café
royal
and
ordering
an
elaborate
dinner
ate
it
slowly
with
thoughtful
enjoyment
when
he
had
finished
he
asked
the
waiter
to
bring
a
figaro
but
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
of
interest
in
that
day
figaro
and
he
laid
it
down
the
ship
had
sailed
by
this
time
had
adeline
really
made
that
confession
to
him
just
before
the
train
started
or
was
it
a
fancy
of
his
there
was
something
fine
about
her
disconcerting
frankness
fine
fine
and
the
simplicity
of
it
he
had
let
slip
a
treasure
because
she
lacked
artistic
sympathies
he
had
despised
her
or
at
best
underestimated
her
and
once
to
think
of
it
he
had
nearly
loved
her
with
what
astonishing
rapidity
their
intimacy
had
waxed
drooped
and
come
to
sudden
death
love
what
love
perhaps
he
loved
her
now
after
all
waiter
he
beckoned
with
a
quaint
movement
of
his
forefinger
which
brought
a
smile
to
the
man
face
a
smile
which
richard
answered
jovially
sir
a
shilling
cigar
please
and
a
coffee
and
cognac
at
about
nine
he
went
out
again
into
the
chill
air
and
the
cigar
burnt
brightly
between
his
lips
he
had
unceremoniously
dismissed
the
too
importunate
image
of
adeline
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
certain
elation
women
were
everywhere
on
the
pavements
they
lifted
their
silk
skirts
out
of
the
mud
revealing
ankles
and
lace
petticoats
they
smiled
on
him
they
lured
him
in
foreign
tongues
and
in
broken
english
he
broadly
winked
at
some
of
the
more
youthful
ones
and
they
followed
him
importunately
only
to
be
shaken
off
with
a
laugh
as
he
walked
he
whistled
or
sang
all
the
time
he
was
cut
adrift
he
explained
to
himself
and
through
no
fault
of
his
own
his
sole
friend
had
left
him
much
she
cared
and
there
was
none
to
whom
he
owed
the
slightest
consideration
he
was
at
liberty
to
do
what
he
liked
without
having
to
consider
first
what
would
think
of
this
moreover
he
must
discover
solace
poor
blighted
creature
looking
down
a
side
street
he
saw
a
man
talking
to
a
woman
he
went
past
them
and
heard
what
they
said
then
he
was
in
shaftesbury
avenue
curious
sensations
fluttered
through
his
frame
with
an
insignificant
oath
he
nerved
himself
to
a
resolve
several
times
he
was
on
the
very
point
of
carrying
it
out
when
his
courage
failed
he
traversed
the
circus
got
as
far
as
hall
and
returned
upon
his
steps
in
a
minute
he
was
on
the
north
side
of
coventry
street
he
looked
into
the
faces
of
all
the
women
but
in
each
he
found
something
to
repel
to
fear
would
it
end
in
his
going
quietly
home
he
crossed
over
into
the
seclusion
of
whitcomb
street
to
argue
the
matter
as
he
was
passing
the
entry
to
a
court
a
woman
came
out
and
both
had
to
draw
back
to
avoid
a
collision
she
murmured
she
was
no
longer
young
but
her
broad
flemish
face
showed
kindliness
and
good
humour
in
every
feature
of
it
and
her
voice
was
soft
he
did
not
answer
and
she
spoke
to
him
again
his
spine
assumed
the
consistency
of
butter
a
shuddering
thrill
ran
through
him
she
put
her
arm
gently
into
his
and
pressed
it
he
had
no
resistance
chapter
xxvi
it
was
the
morning
of
boxing
day
frosty
with
a
sky
of
steel
grey
the
streets
were
resonant
under
the
traffic
richard
had
long
been
anticipating
the
advent
of
the
new
year
when
new
resolutions
were
to
come
into
force
a
phrase
from
a
sermon
heard
at
bursley
stuck
in
his
memory
day
begins
a
new
but
he
could
not
summon
the
swift
courageous
decision
necessary
to
act
upon
that
adage
for
a
whole
year
he
had
been
slowly
subsiding
into
a
bog
of
lethargy
and
to
extricate
himself
would
he
felt
need
an
amount
of
exertion
which
he
could
not
put
forth
unless
fortified
by
all
the
associations
of
the
season
for
such
feats
and
by
the
knowledge
that
were
bracing
themselves
for
a
similar
difficult
wrench
now
that
he
looked
back
upon
them
the
fourteen
months
which
had
elapsed
since
adeline
departure
seemed
to
have
succeeded
one
another
with
marvellous
rapidity
at
first
he
had
chafed
under
the
loss
of
her
and
then
gradually
and
naturally
he
had
grown
used
to
her
absence
she
wrote
to
him
a
rather
long
letter
full
of
details
about
the
voyage
and
the
train
journey
and
her
uncles
home
he
had
opened
the
envelope
half
expecting
that
the
letter
might
affect
him
deeply
but
it
did
not
it
struck
him
as
a
distinctly
mediocre
communication
he
sent
a
reply
and
the
correspondence
ended
he
did
not
love
her
probably
never
had
loved
her
a
little
sentiment
that
was
all
the
affair
was
quite
over
if
it
had
been
perhaps
unsatisfactory
the
fault
was
not
his
a
man
he
reflected
can
not
by
taking
thought
fall
in
love
and
yet
this
was
exactly
what
he
had
attempted
to
do
and
that
in
any
case
adeline
would
not
have
suited
him
still
at
moments
when
he
recalled
her
face
and
gestures
her
exquisite
feminality
and
especially
her
fine
candour
at
their
parting
he
grew
melancholy
and
luxuriously
pitied
himself
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
which
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
he
had
attacked
the
art
of
literature
anew
and
had
compassed
several
articles
but
as
one
by
one
they
suffered
rejection
his
energy
had
dwindled
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
again
entirely
ceased
to
write
nor
did
he
pursue
any
ordered
course
of
study
he
began
upon
a
number
of
english
classics
finishing
few
of
them
and
continued
to
consume
french
novels
with
eagerness
sometimes
the
french
work
by
its
neat
severe
effectiveness
would
stir
in
him
a
vague
desire
to
do
likewise
but
no
serious
sustained
effort
was
made
in
the
spring
when
loneliness
is
peculiarly
wearisome
he
had
joined
a
literary
and
scientific
institution
for
young
men
only
upon
whose
premises
it
was
forbidden
either
to
drink
intoxicants
or
to
smoke
tobacco
he
paid
a
year
subscription
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
loathed
not
only
the
institution
but
every
separate
member
and
official
of
it
then
he
thought
of
transplanting
himself
to
the
suburbs
but
the
trouble
of
moving
the
library
of
books
which
by
this
time
he
had
accumulated
deterred
him
as
well
as
a
lazy
aversion
for
the
discomforts
which
a
change
would
certainly
involve
and
so
he
had
sunk
into
a
sort
of
coma
his
chief
task
was
to
kill
time
eight
hours
were
due
to
the
office
and
eight
to
sleep
and
eight
others
remained
to
be
disposed
of
daily
in
the
morning
he
rose
late
retarding
his
breakfast
hour
diligently
read
the
newspaper
and
took
the
park
on
the
way
to
business
in
the
evening
as
six
approached
he
no
longer
hurried
his
work
in
order
to
be
ready
to
leave
the
office
immediately
the
clock
struck
on
the
contrary
he
often
stayed
after
hours
when
there
was
no
necessity
to
stay
either
leisurely
examining
his
accounts
or
gossiping
with
jenkins
or
one
of
the
older
clerks
he
watched
the
firm
welfare
with
a
jealous
eye
offered
suggestions
to
curpet
which
not
seldom
were
accepted
and
grew
to
be
regarded
as
exceptionally
capable
and
trustworthy
he
could
divine
now
and
then
in
the
tone
or
the
look
of
the
principals
who
were
niggardly
with
praise
an
implicit
trust
mingled
at
any
rate
in
the
case
of
the
senior
partner
with
a
certain
respect
he
grew
more
sedate
in
manner
and
to
the
office
boys
over
whom
he
had
charge
he
was
even
forbidding
they
disliked
him
finding
him
a
martinet
more
strict
and
less
suave
than
curpet
himself
he
kept
them
late
at
night
sometimes
without
quite
sufficient
cause
and
if
they
showed
dissatisfaction
told
them
sententiously
that
boys
who
were
so
desperately
anxious
to
do
as
little
as
they
could
would
never
get
on
in
the
world
upon
leaving
the
office
he
would
stroll
slowly
through
booksellers
row
and
up
the
strand
with
the
gait
of
a
man
whose
time
is
entirely
his
own
once
or
twice
a
week
he
dined
at
one
of
the
foreign
restaurants
in
soho
prolonging
the
meal
to
an
unconscionable
length
and
repairing
afterwards
to
some
lounge
for
a
cigar
and
a
liqueur
he
paid
particular
attention
to
his
dress
enjoying
the
sensation
of
wearing
good
clothes
and
fell
into
a
habit
of
comparing
his
personal
appearance
with
that
of
the
men
whom
he
rubbed
shoulders
with
in
fashionable
cafés
and
bars
his
salary
sufficed
for
these
petty
extravagances
since
he
was
still
living
inexpensively
in
one
room
at
raphael
street
but
besides
what
he
earned
his
resources
included
the
sum
received
from
the
estate
of
william
vernon
seventy
pounds
of
this
had
melted
in
festivities
with
adeline
two
hundred
pounds
was
lent
upon
mortgage
under
guidance
and
the
other
fifty
was
kept
in
hand
being
broken
into
as
infrequent
occasion
demanded
the
mortgage
investment
did
much
to
heighten
his
status
not
only
with
the
staff
but
with
his
principals
seated
in
a
or
hall
meditatively
sipping
from
glass
or
tankard
and
savouring
a
fragrant
cigar
he
contrived
to
extract
a
certain
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
his
equality
with
the
men
around
him
many
of
them
he
guessed
with
satisfaction
were
in
a
worse
or
a
less
secure
position
than
his
own
he
studied
faces
and
made
a
practice
of
entering
into
conversation
with
strangers
and
these
chance
encounters
almost
invariably
left
him
with
the
impression
that
he
had
met
a
mental
inferior
steeping
himself
as
it
were
in
all
the
frivolous
lusory
activities
of
the
west
end
he
began
to
acquire
that
indefinable
unmistakable
air
of
characteristic
of
the
prosperous
clerk
who
spends
his
leisure
in
public
places
people
from
the
country
frequently
mistook
him
for
the
young
of
the
society
papers
familiar
with
every
form
of
metropolitan
chicane
luxury
and
vice
after
breakfast
he
went
out
into
the
park
with
his
skates
the
serpentine
had
been
frozen
hard
for
more
than
a
week
and
yesterday
a
solitary
unit
in
tens
of
thousands
he
had
celebrated
christmas
on
the
ice
skating
from
noon
till
nearly
midnight
with
brief
intervals
for
meals
the
exercise
and
the
fresh
air
had
invigorated
and
enlivened
him
and
this
morning
as
he
plunged
once
more
into
the
loose
throng
of
skaters
his
spirits
were
buoyant
it
had
been
his
intention
to
pass
yet
another
day
on
the
serpentine
but
a
sudden
surprising
fancy
entered
his
head
flitted
away
and
returned
again
and
again
with
such
an
increasing
allurement
that
he
fell
in
love
with
it
why
not
commence
to
write
now
why
after
all
leave
the
new
beginning
till
the
new
year
was
it
true
what
he
had
mournfully
taken
for
granted
for
a
month
past
and
so
lately
as
an
hour
ago
that
he
lacked
the
moral
strength
to
carry
a
good
resolution
into
effect
at
any
time
he
chose
in
a
moment
he
had
sworn
to
work
four
hours
before
he
slept
that
night
the
decision
reached
his
humour
became
unequivocally
gay
he
shot
forward
with
longer
bolder
strokes
enjoying
with
a
keener
zest
the
swift
motion
and
the
strange
scene
about
him
he
forgot
the
year
of
idleness
which
lay
immediately
behind
him
forgot
every
previous
failure
in
the
passionate
exultation
of
his
new
resolve
he
whistled
he
sang
he
attempted
impossible
figures
and
only
laughed
when
they
ended
in
a
fall
a
woman
skating
alone
stumbled
to
her
knees
he
glided
towards
her
lifted
her
lightly
raised
his
hat
and
was
gone
before
she
could
thank
him
it
was
neatly
done
he
felt
proud
of
himself
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
he
took
off
his
skates
and
walked
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
park
deliberating
intently
upon
the
plot
of
a
story
which
fortunately
had
been
in
his
mind
for
several
months
when
he
came
in
to
dinner
he
gave
lily
five
shillings
for
a
christmas
box
almost
without
thinking
and
though
he
had
no
previous
intention
of
doing
so
and
inquired
when
she
was
to
be
married
he
ordered
tea
for
four
so
that
the
evening
might
be
long
in
the
afternoon
he
read
and
dozed
at
a
quarter
to
five
the
were
cleared
away
the
lamp
was
burning
brightly
the
blinds
drawn
and
his
arranged
on
the
table
he
lit
a
pipe
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
at
last
at
last
the
old
endeavours
were
about
to
be
resumed
the
story
which
he
was
going
to
write
was
called
the
leading
character
was
an
old
smith
to
be
named
downs
employed
in
the
forge
of
a
large
iron
foundry
at
bursley
downs
was
a
primitive
methodist
of
the
narrowest
type
and
when
his
daughter
fell
in
love
with
and
married
a
sceneshifter
at
the
local
theatre
she
received
for
dowry
a
father
curse
once
in
the
foundry
downs
in
speaking
of
the
matter
had
referred
to
his
daughter
as
no
better
than
a
and
for
years
afterwards
a
favourite
sport
of
the
apprentice
boys
was
to
run
after
him
at
a
safe
distance
calling
the
daughter
completely
estranged
from
her
parent
died
in
giving
birth
to
a
son
who
grew
up
physically
strong
and
healthy
but
half
an
idiot
at
the
age
of
twelve
quite
ignorant
of
his
grandfather
identity
he
was
sent
by
his
father
to
work
at
the
foundry
the
other
lads
saw
a
chance
for
fun
pointing
out
downs
to
him
in
the
forge
they
told
him
to
go
close
to
the
man
and
say
what
dost
thee
want
downs
questioned
gruffly
when
the
boy
stood
before
him
with
a
vacant
grin
on
his
face
came
the
response
in
the
aggravating
uninflected
tones
peculiar
to
an
imbecile
downs
raised
his
tremendous
arm
in
a
flash
of
anger
and
felled
the
youngster
with
a
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
then
he
bade
him
rise
but
the
child
caught
just
under
the
ear
had
been
struck
dead
downs
was
tried
for
manslaughter
pronounced
insane
and
subsequently
released
as
a
harmless
lunatic
the
salvation
army
took
charge
of
him
and
he
lived
by
selling
in
the
streets
still
pursued
by
boys
who
shouted
properly
elaborated
richard
opined
such
a
plot
would
make
a
powerful
story
in
his
brain
the
thing
was
already
complete
the
one
difficulty
lay
in
the
selection
of
a
strong
opening
scene
that
done
he
was
sure
the
incidents
of
the
tale
would
fall
naturally
into
place
he
began
to
cogitate
but
his
thoughts
went
most
pertinaciously
though
time
after
time
he
compelled
them
to
return
to
the
subject
in
hand
by
force
of
knitted
brows
he
finished
his
pipe
and
recharged
it
the
fire
burnt
low
and
he
put
on
more
coal
still
no
suitable
opening
scene
presented
itself
his
spirits
slowly
fell
what
ailed
him
at
length
an
idea
he
was
not
going
to
fail
after
all
the
story
must
of
course
begin
with
a
quarrel
between
old
downs
and
his
daughter
he
drew
up
to
the
table
took
a
pen
and
wrote
the
title
then
a
few
sentences
hurriedly
and
then
a
page
then
he
read
what
was
written
pronounced
it
unconvincing
rubbish
and
tore
it
up
words
were
untractable
and
besides
he
could
not
the
scene
he
left
the
table
and
after
studying
a
tale
of
de
maupassant
started
on
a
new
sheet
carefully
imitating
the
manner
of
that
writer
but
he
could
by
no
means
satisfy
himself
rowbotham
appeared
with
the
and
he
laid
his
on
the
bed
during
supper
he
took
up
de
maupassant
once
more
and
at
ten
made
yet
a
third
attempt
well
knowing
beforehand
that
it
would
not
be
successful
the
plot
tumbled
entirely
to
pieces
the
conclusion
especially
was
undramatic
but
how
to
alter
it
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
he
wondered
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
lost
his
situation
supposing
that
the
firm
of
curpet
and
smythe
failed
smythe
was
a
careless
fellow
capable
of
ruining
business
in
a
month
if
for
any
reason
curpet
restraining
influence
was
withdrawn
these
and
similar
morbid
fancies
assailed
him
and
he
went
to
bed
sick
with
misery
heartily
wishing
that
he
had
been
less
precipitate
in
his
attempt
to
be
industrious
he
had
a
superstition
that
if
he
had
waited
for
the
new
year
the
adventure
might
have
resulted
more
happily
in
the
night
he
awoke
to
lament
upon
his
solitariness
why
had
he
no
congenial
friends
how
could
he
set
about
obtaining
sympathetic
companionship
he
needed
in
particular
cultured
feminine
society
given
that
he
could
work
without
it
he
should
accomplish
nothing
he
reflected
that
in
london
there
were
probably
thousands
of
nice
girls
pining
for
such
men
as
he
what
a
ridiculous
civilisation
it
was
that
prevented
him
from
meeting
them
when
he
saw
a
promising
girl
in
a
bus
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
should
he
not
be
at
liberty
to
say
to
her
look
here
i
can
convince
you
that
i
mean
well
let
us
make
each
other
acquaintance
but
convention
convention
he
felt
himself
to
be
imprisoned
by
a
relentless
unscaleable
wall
then
he
dreamt
that
he
was
in
a
full
of
young
men
and
women
and
that
all
were
chattering
vivaciously
and
cleverly
he
himself
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
talked
to
a
group
of
girls
they
looked
into
his
face
as
adeline
used
to
look
they
grasped
his
ideals
and
his
aims
without
laborious
explanations
half
a
word
was
sufficient
to
enlighten
them
he
saw
the
gleam
of
appreciative
comprehension
in
their
eyes
long
before
his
sentences
were
finished
chapter
xxvii
the
next
morning
was
bright
with
sunshine
the
frost
had
broken
and
the
streets
were
beginning
to
be
muddy
richard
went
out
his
mind
empty
and
dully
dejected
at
sloane
street
he
mounted
a
bus
taking
the
one
vacant
front
seat
on
the
top
for
a
little
while
he
stared
absently
at
the
handle
of
his
stick
presently
a
chance
movement
of
the
head
made
him
aware
that
someone
eyes
were
upon
him
he
looked
round
in
the
far
corner
of
the
seat
opposite
was
miss
roberts
she
hesitated
flushing
and
then
bowed
and
he
responded
no
further
communications
were
possible
just
then
and
for
this
at
the
moment
he
felt
thankful
because
they
were
separated
by
two
young
gentlemen
wearing
tweed
caps
and
collars
which
might
have
been
clean
once
who
were
arguing
briskly
over
a
copy
of
the
sportsman
for
some
strange
reason
of
diffidence
richard
had
not
been
to
the
crabtree
since
his
visit
there
with
adeline
he
was
sardonically
in
search
of
his
motive
for
staying
away
when
the
young
gentlemen
with
the
sportsman
left
the
bus
miss
roberts
grew
rosy
as
he
got
up
and
offered
her
his
hand
at
the
same
time
seating
himself
by
her
side
she
wore
a
black
jacket
and
skirt
well
worn
but
in
good
preservation
a
hat
with
red
flowers
and
grey
woollen
gloves
and
any
person
of
ordinary
discernment
would
have
guessed
her
occupation
without
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
during
the
last
year
she
had
become
stouter
and
her
figure
was
now
full
rather
than
slender
her
features
especially
the
nostrils
mouth
and
chin
were
somewhat
heavy
but
she
had
prettily
shaped
ears
and
her
eyes
of
no
definable
tint
were
soft
and
tender
her
hair
was
as
conspicuous
and
as
splendid
as
ever
coiled
with
tight
precision
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
escaping
here
and
there
above
her
ears
in
tiny
flying
wisps
the
expression
of
her
face
was
mainly
one
of
amiability
but
passive
inert
she
seemed
full
of
we
have
seen
you
at
the
crabtree
lately
she
said
you
are
still
at
the
old
place
then
oh
yes
and
shall
be
i
expect
they
taken
another
floor
now
and
we
the
biggest
vegetarian
restaurant
in
london
there
was
a
note
of
timid
agitation
in
her
voice
and
he
noticed
besides
that
her
cheeks
were
red
and
her
eyes
shone
could
it
be
that
this
encounter
had
given
her
pleasure
the
idea
of
such
a
possibility
afforded
him
secret
delight
she
a
breathing
woman
glad
to
see
him
he
wondered
what
the
other
people
on
the
bus
were
thinking
of
them
and
especially
what
the
driver
thought
the
driver
had
happened
to
catch
sight
of
them
when
they
were
shaking
hands
and
as
richard
examined
the
contour
of
the
man
rubicund
face
he
fancied
he
saw
there
a
glimmer
of
a
smile
this
was
during
a
little
pause
in
the
conversation
and
how
have
you
spent
christmas
it
was
richard
question
at
home
she
answered
simply
with
father
and
mother
my
married
sister
and
her
husband
came
over
for
the
day
and
i
spent
mine
all
alone
he
said
ruefully
no
friends
no
pudding
no
nothing
she
looked
at
him
compassionately
i
suppose
you
live
in
rooms
it
must
be
very
lonely
oh
he
returned
lightly
yet
seizing
with
eager
satisfaction
the
sympathy
she
offered
it
nothing
when
you
used
to
it
this
makes
my
third
christmas
in
london
and
none
of
them
has
been
particularly
uproarious
fortunately
there
was
the
skating
this
year
i
was
on
the
serpentine
nearly
all
day
then
she
asked
him
if
skating
was
easy
to
learn
because
she
had
been
wanting
to
try
for
years
but
had
never
had
opportunity
he
answered
that
it
was
quite
easy
if
one
were
not
afraid
i
going
your
way
he
said
as
they
both
got
off
at
piccadilly
circus
and
they
walked
along
coventry
street
together
the
talk
flagged
to
rouse
it
richard
questioned
her
about
the
routine
of
the
restaurant
a
subject
on
which
she
spoke
readily
and
with
a
certain
sense
of
humour
when
they
reached
the
crabtree
why
it
been
painted
richard
exclaimed
it
looks
very
swagger
indeed
now
yes
my
does
it
and
it
beautiful
inside
too
you
must
come
in
sometime
i
will
he
said
with
emphasis
she
shook
his
hand
quite
vigorously
and
their
eyes
met
with
a
curious
questioning
gaze
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
walked
down
chandos
street
his
dejection
had
mysteriously
vanished
and
he
even
experienced
a
certain
uplifting
of
spirit
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
never
at
all
understood
miss
roberts
before
how
different
she
was
outside
the
restaurant
should
he
go
to
the
crabtree
for
lunch
that
day
or
should
he
allow
a
day
or
two
to
elapse
he
decidedly
prudently
to
wait
he
debated
whether
he
should
mention
the
meeting
to
jenkins
and
said
on
the
whole
that
he
would
not
do
so
but
he
found
jenkins
surprisingly
urbane
and
without
conscious
volition
he
was
soon
saying
guess
who
i
came
down
with
on
the
bus
this
morning
jenkins
gave
it
up
laura
roberts
and
then
seeing
no
look
of
comprehension
on
face
you
know
the
cashier
at
the
crabtree
oh
the
stress
was
a
little
irritating
saw
her
about
a
fortnight
ago
jenkins
said
at
the
crabtree
yes
did
she
say
anything
to
you
about
me
the
youth
smiled
no
why
nothing
we
had
a
talk
and
i
mashed
her
a
bit
that
all
ah
my
boy
you
wo
get
far
with
her
oh
i
i
could
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
laura
roberts
if
i
liked
although
jenkins
remark
was
characteristic
and
richard
knew
well
enough
that
there
was
nothing
behind
his
words
yet
his
mind
reverted
instantly
to
the
stories
connecting
miss
roberts
with
aked
do
gas
he
said
curtly
she
looks
on
you
as
a
boy
man
enough
for
any
woman
said
jenkins
twirling
the
rudiments
of
a
moustache
the
discussion
might
have
gone
further
had
it
not
been
interrupted
by
smythe
who
burst
suddenly
into
the
room
as
his
custom
was
larch
come
with
me
into
curpet
room
his
tone
was
brusque
he
had
none
of
curpet
natural
politeness
though
on
rare
occasions
of
which
the
present
was
not
one
he
sought
clumsily
to
imitate
it
richard
felt
a
vague
alarm
with
a
muffler
round
his
throat
curpet
was
seated
before
the
fire
blowing
his
nose
and
breathing
noisily
smythe
went
to
the
window
and
played
with
the
tassel
of
the
blind
cord
we
are
thinking
of
making
some
changes
larch
curpet
began
yes
sir
his
heart
sank
was
he
to
be
dismissed
the
next
sentence
was
reassuring
in
future
all
costs
will
be
drawn
and
settled
in
the
office
instead
of
being
sent
out
do
you
feel
equal
to
taking
charge
of
that
department
richard
had
many
times
helped
in
the
preparation
of
bills
of
cost
and
possessed
a
fair
knowledge
of
this
complicated
and
engaging
subject
he
answered
very
decidedly
in
the
affirmative
what
we
propose
smythe
broke
in
is
that
you
should
have
an
assistant
and
that
the
two
of
you
should
attend
to
both
the
books
and
the
costs
of
course
your
salary
will
be
increased
curpet
added
let
me
see
what
do
you
get
now
this
from
smythe
whose
memory
was
imperfect
three
pounds
ten
sir
suppose
we
say
four
pounds
ten
said
smythe
to
curpet
and
then
turning
to
larch
that
very
good
indeed
you
know
young
man
you
would
get
that
everywhere
by
jove
no
you
would
richard
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
he
could
scarcely
credit
his
own
luck
and
we
shall
expect
you
to
keep
things
up
to
the
mark
curpet
smiled
kindly
over
his
handkerchief
as
if
to
intimate
that
smythe
need
not
have
insisted
on
that
point
and
you
may
have
to
stay
late
sometimes
smythe
went
on
yes
sir
when
the
interview
was
finished
he
retraced
his
career
at
the
office
marvelling
that
he
should
have
done
anything
unusual
enough
to
inspire
his
principals
to
such
appreciation
and
he
soon
made
out
that
compared
with
others
of
the
staff
he
had
indeed
been
a
model
clerk
a
delicious
enveloped
him
smythe
had
had
the
air
of
conferring
a
favour
but
curpet
was
at
the
head
of
affairs
at
no
serjeant
court
and
curpet
attitude
had
been
decidedly
flattering
at
first
he
had
a
difficulty
in
grasping
his
good
fortune
thought
it
too
good
to
be
true
but
he
ended
by
believing
in
himself
very
heartily
in
the
matter
of
salary
he
stood
now
second
only
to
alder
he
a
youth
not
three
years
out
of
the
provinces
three
years
ago
an
income
of
per
annum
would
have
seemed
almost
fabulous
his
notions
as
to
what
constituted
opulence
had
changed
since
then
but
nevertheless
was
an
excellent
revenue
full
of
possibilities
a
man
could
marry
on
that
and
live
comfortably
many
men
ventured
to
marry
on
half
as
much
in
clerkdom
he
had
indubitably
risen
with
ease
to
the
upper
ranks
there
was
good
northern
stuff
in
richard
larch
after
all
as
he
walked
home
his
brain
was
busy
with
plans
beautiful
plans
for
the
new
year
how
he
would
save
money
and
how
he
would
spend
his
nights
in
toil
chapter
xxviii
there
happened
to
be
a
room
to
let
on
the
same
floor
as
own
the
rent
was
only
five
shillings
per
week
and
he
arranged
to
take
it
and
use
it
as
a
bedroom
transforming
the
other
and
larger
room
into
a
study
rowbotham
was
asked
to
remove
all
her
tables
chairs
carpets
pictures
ornaments
and
accessories
from
both
rooms
as
he
proposed
to
furnish
them
entirely
anew
at
his
own
cost
this
did
not
indicate
that
a
sudden
increase
of
revenue
had
as
once
on
a
previous
occasion
engendered
in
him
a
propensity
to
squander
on
the
contrary
his
determination
to
live
economically
was
well
established
and
he
hoped
to
save
a
hundred
pounds
per
annum
with
ease
but
the
influence
of
an
æsthetic
environment
upon
his
literary
work
would
he
argued
probably
be
valuable
enough
to
justify
the
moderate
expenditure
involved
and
so
all
the
leisure
of
the
last
days
of
the
year
was
given
to
the
realisation
of
certain
theories
in
regard
to
the
furnishing
of
a
study
and
a
bedroom
unfortunately
the
time
at
his
disposal
was
very
limited
was
it
not
essential
that
the
place
should
be
set
in
order
by
the
of
december
that
work
might
commence
on
the
of
january
but
he
did
not
spare
himself
and
the
result
when
he
contemplated
it
on
new
year
eve
filled
him
with
pleasure
and
pride
he
felt
that
he
could
write
worthily
in
that
study
with
its
four
autotype
reproductions
of
celebrated
pictures
on
the
walls
its
square
of
indian
carpet
over
indian
matting
its
long
low
bookshelves
its
quaint
table
with
the
elm
top
its
plain
chairs
and
its
broad
luxurious
divan
he
marvelled
that
he
had
contrived
so
long
to
exist
in
the
room
as
it
was
before
and
complacently
attributed
his
as
a
writer
to
the
lack
of
harmonious
surroundings
by
the
last
post
arrived
a
new
year
card
from
clayton
vernon
twelve
months
ago
she
had
sent
a
similar
kind
token
of
remembrance
and
he
had
ignored
it
in
the
summer
she
had
written
inviting
him
to
spend
a
few
days
at
bursley
and
he
had
somewhat
too
briefly
asked
to
be
excused
however
he
went
out
bought
a
new
year
card
and
despatched
it
to
her
at
once
he
flowed
over
with
benevolence
viewing
the
world
through
the
rosy
spectacles
of
high
resolve
clayton
vernon
was
an
excellent
woman
and
he
would
prove
to
her
and
to
bursley
that
they
had
not
estimated
too
highly
the
possibilities
of
richard
larch
he
was
in
truth
prodigiously
uplifted
the
old
sense
of
absolute
power
over
himself
for
good
or
evil
returned
a
consciousness
of
exceptional
ability
possessed
him
the
future
splendid
in
dreams
was
wholly
his
and
yet
again
perhaps
more
thoroughly
than
ever
before
the
ineffectual
past
was
effaced
was
the
new
year
and
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
were
to
begin
he
had
decided
to
write
a
novel
having
failed
in
short
stories
and
in
essays
it
seemed
to
him
likely
that
the
novel
a
form
which
he
had
not
so
far
seriously
attempted
might
suit
his
idiosyncrasy
better
he
had
once
sketched
out
the
plot
of
a
short
novel
a
tale
of
adventure
in
modern
london
and
on
examination
this
struck
him
as
ingenious
and
promising
moreover
it
would
appeal
like
stevenson
new
arabian
nights
which
in
richard
mind
it
distantly
resembled
both
to
the
general
and
to
the
literary
public
he
determined
to
write
five
hundred
words
of
it
a
day
five
days
a
week
at
this
rate
of
progress
he
calculated
that
the
book
would
be
finished
in
four
months
allowing
two
months
further
for
revision
it
ought
to
be
ready
for
a
publisher
at
the
end
of
june
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
blazing
fire
and
looked
down
the
vista
of
those
long
lamplit
evenings
during
which
the
novel
was
to
grow
under
his
hands
how
different
he
from
the
average
clerk
who
with
similar
opportunities
was
content
to
fritter
away
those
hours
which
would
lead
himself
perhaps
to
fame
he
thought
of
adeline
and
smiled
what
after
all
did
such
as
he
want
with
women
he
was
in
a
position
to
marry
and
if
he
met
a
clever
girl
of
sympathetic
temperament
he
emphatically
would
marry
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
add
the
clause
provided
she
will
have
me
but
otherwise
he
would
wait
he
could
afford
to
wait
to
wait
till
he
had
made
a
reputation
and
half
a
score
of
women
elegant
and
refined
were
only
too
willing
to
envelop
him
in
an
atmosphere
of
adoration
it
was
part
of
his
plan
for
economy
to
dine
always
at
the
crabtree
where
one
shilling
was
the
price
of
an
elaborate
repast
and
he
went
there
on
new
year
day
as
he
walked
up
charing
cross
road
his
thoughts
turned
naturally
to
miss
roberts
would
she
be
as
cordial
as
when
he
had
met
her
on
the
omnibus
or
would
she
wear
the
polite
mask
of
the
cashier
treating
him
merely
as
a
frequenter
of
the
establishment
she
was
engaged
when
he
entered
the
but
she
noticed
him
and
nodded
he
looked
towards
her
several
times
during
his
meal
and
once
her
eyes
caught
his
and
she
smiled
not
withdrawing
them
for
a
few
moments
then
she
bent
over
her
account
book
his
seemed
curiously
to
have
degenerated
to
have
grown
still
narrower
in
their
sympathies
still
more
careless
in
their
eating
still
more
peculiar
or
shabbier
in
their
dress
the
young
women
of
masculine
aspect
set
their
elbows
on
the
table
more
uncompromisingly
than
ever
and
the
young
men
with
soiled
wristbands
or
no
wristbands
at
all
were
more
than
ever
tedious
in
their
murmured
conversations
it
was
indeed
a
bizarre
company
that
surrounded
him
then
he
reflected
that
these
people
had
not
altered
the
change
was
in
himself
he
had
outgrown
them
he
surveyed
them
now
as
from
a
tower
he
was
a
man
with
a
future
using
this
restaurant
because
it
suited
him
temporarily
to
do
so
while
they
would
use
it
till
the
end
never
deviating
never
leaving
the
rut
so
you
have
come
at
last
miss
roberts
said
to
him
when
he
presented
his
check
i
was
beginning
to
think
you
had
deserted
us
but
it
barely
a
week
since
i
saw
you
he
protested
let
me
wish
you
a
happy
new
year
the
same
to
you
she
flushed
a
little
and
then
what
do
you
think
of
our
new
decorations
are
they
pretty
he
praised
them
perfunctorily
even
without
glancing
round
his
eyes
were
on
her
face
he
remembered
the
reiterated
insinuations
of
jenkins
and
wondered
whether
they
had
any
ground
of
fact
by
the
way
has
jenkins
been
here
he
inquired
by
way
of
introducing
the
name
is
that
the
young
man
who
used
to
come
with
you
sometimes
no
there
was
no
trace
of
in
her
bearing
and
richard
resolved
to
handle
jenkins
with
severity
another
customer
approached
the
well
good
afternoon
he
lingered
good
afternoon
her
gaze
rested
on
him
softly
i
suppose
you
be
here
again
time
she
spoke
low
so
that
the
other
customer
should
not
hear
i
coming
every
day
now
i
think
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
with
a
smothered
laugh
that
night
at
seven
he
began
his
novel
the
opening
chapter
was
introductory
and
the
words
came
without
much
effort
this
being
only
a
draft
there
was
no
need
for
polish
so
that
when
a
sentence
refused
to
run
smoothly
at
the
first
trial
he
was
content
to
make
it
grammatical
and
leave
it
he
seemed
to
have
been
working
for
hours
when
a
desire
took
him
to
count
up
what
was
already
written
six
hundred
words
he
sighed
the
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
looked
at
his
watch
to
find
that
it
was
exactly
eight
the
discovery
somewhat
damped
his
felicity
he
began
to
doubt
whether
stuff
composed
at
the
rate
of
ten
words
a
minute
could
have
any
real
value
pooh
sometimes
one
wrote
quickly
and
sometimes
slowly
the
number
of
minutes
occupied
was
no
index
of
quality
should
he
continue
writing
yes
he
would
no
why
should
he
he
had
performed
the
task
for
the
day
and
more
and
now
he
was
entitled
to
rest
true
the
actual
time
of
labour
had
been
very
short
but
then
another
day
the
same
amount
of
work
might
consume
three
or
four
hours
he
put
away
his
and
searched
about
for
something
to
read
finally
lighting
on
paradise
lost
but
paradise
lost
wanted
actuality
he
laid
it
aside
was
there
any
valid
reason
why
he
should
not
conclude
the
evening
at
the
theatre
none
the
frost
had
returned
with
power
and
the
reverberation
of
the
streets
sounded
invitingly
through
his
curtained
windows
he
went
out
and
walked
briskly
up
park
side
at
hyde
park
corner
he
jumped
on
an
omnibus
it
was
the
first
night
of
a
new
ballet
at
the
ottoman
only
said
the
man
at
the
all
right
said
richard
and
entering
was
greeted
with
soft
music
which
came
to
him
like
a
fitful
zephyr
over
a
sea
of
heads
chapter
xxix
one
saturday
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
february
he
suddenly
decided
to
read
through
so
much
of
the
draft
novel
as
was
written
hitherto
he
had
avoided
any
sort
of
revision
the
resolve
to
accomplish
five
hundred
words
a
day
had
been
kept
indifferently
well
and
the
total
stood
at
about
fourteen
thousand
as
he
wrote
a
very
bold
hand
the
sheets
covered
made
quite
a
respectable
pile
the
mere
bulk
of
them
cajoled
him
in
spite
of
certain
misgivings
into
an
optimistic
surmise
as
to
their
literary
quality
never
before
had
he
written
so
much
upon
one
theme
and
were
the
writing
good
or
bad
he
was
for
a
few
moments
proud
of
his
achievement
the
mischief
lay
in
the
fact
that
week
by
week
he
had
exercised
less
and
still
less
care
over
the
work
the
phrase
anything
will
do
for
a
draft
had
come
to
be
uttered
with
increasing
frequency
as
an
excuse
for
laxities
of
style
and
construction
i
will
make
that
right
in
the
revision
he
had
reassured
himself
and
had
gone
negligently
forward
leaving
innumerable
crudities
in
the
wake
of
his
hurrying
pen
during
the
last
few
days
he
had
written
scarcely
anything
and
perhaps
it
was
a
hope
of
stimulating
a
drooping
inspiration
by
the
complacent
survey
of
work
actually
done
that
tempted
him
to
this
hazardous
perusal
he
whistled
as
he
took
up
the
manuscript
as
a
boy
whistles
when
going
into
a
dark
cellar
the
first
three
pages
were
read
punctiliously
every
word
of
them
but
soon
he
grew
hasty
rushing
to
the
next
paragraph
ere
the
previous
one
was
grasped
then
he
began
shamelessly
to
skip
and
then
he
stopped
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
also
the
lack
of
homogeneity
of
sequence
of
dramatic
quality
of
human
interest
the
loose
syntax
and
the
unrelieved
mediocrity
of
it
all
horrified
him
the
thing
was
dry
bones
a
fiasco
the
certainty
that
he
had
once
more
failed
swept
over
him
like
a
cold
green
wave
of
the
sea
and
he
had
a
physical
feeling
of
sickness
in
the
stomach
it
was
with
much
ado
that
he
refrained
from
putting
the
whole
manuscript
upon
the
fire
and
crushing
it
venomously
into
the
flames
with
a
poker
then
he
steadied
himself
his
was
going
almost
gone
he
must
contrive
to
recover
it
and
he
sought
for
a
way
where
were
now
the
rash
exultations
of
the
new
year
it
was
impossible
that
his
work
should
be
irredeemably
bad
he
remembered
having
read
somewhere
that
the
difference
between
a
fine
and
a
worthless
novel
was
often
a
difference
of
elaboration
simply
a
conscientious
therefore
might
probably
bring
about
a
surprising
amelioration
he
must
immediately
make
the
experiment
but
he
had
long
since
solemnly
vowed
not
to
commence
the
second
writing
till
the
draft
was
done
the
moral
value
of
finishing
even
the
draft
had
then
seemed
to
him
priceless
no
matter
under
stress
of
grievous
necessity
that
oath
must
be
forsworn
no
other
course
could
save
him
from
collapse
he
went
out
into
the
streets
the
weather
fine
and
bright
suggested
the
earliest
infancy
of
spring
and
piccadilly
was
full
of
all
classes
and
all
ages
of
women
there
were
regiments
of
men
too
but
the
gay
and
endless
stream
of
women
obsessed
him
he
saw
them
sitting
in
hansoms
and
private
carriages
and
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
niched
in
high
windows
shining
in
obscurity
of
shops
treading
the
pavements
with
fairy
step
either
unattended
or
by
the
side
of
foolish
unappreciative
males
every
man
in
london
seemed
to
have
the
right
to
a
share
of
some
woman
companionship
except
himself
as
for
those
men
who
walked
alone
they
had
sweethearts
somewhere
or
mothers
and
sisters
or
they
were
married
and
even
now
on
the
way
to
wife
and
hearth
only
he
was
set
apart
a
light
descended
upon
him
that
afternoon
the
average
man
and
the
average
woman
being
constantly
thrown
into
each
other
society
custom
has
staled
for
them
the
exquisite
privilege
of
such
intercourse
the
rustic
can
not
share
the
townsman
enthusiasm
for
rural
scenery
he
sees
no
matter
for
ecstasy
in
the
view
from
his
cottage
door
and
in
the
same
way
the
average
man
and
the
average
woman
dine
together
talk
together
walk
together
and
know
not
how
richly
they
are
therein
blessed
but
with
solitaries
like
richard
it
is
different
debarred
from
fellowship
with
the
opposite
sex
by
circumstances
and
an
innate
diffidence
which
makes
the
control
of
circumstance
impossible
their
starved
sensibilities
acquire
certain
morbid
tenderness
doubtless
the
rustic
discerns
morbidity
in
the
attitude
of
the
townsman
towards
the
view
from
his
cottage
door
richard
grasped
this
in
a
luminous
moment
of
he
was
able
to
trace
the
growth
of
the
malady
from
its
first
vague
and
fugitive
symptoms
it
had
so
grown
that
now
on
seeing
an
attractive
woman
he
could
not
be
content
to
say
what
an
attractive
woman
and
have
done
with
it
but
he
needs
must
build
a
house
furnish
a
room
in
the
house
light
a
fire
in
the
room
place
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
put
the
woman
in
the
chair
with
a
welcoming
smile
on
her
upturned
lips
and
imagine
that
she
was
his
wife
and
it
was
not
only
attractive
women
that
laid
the
spell
upon
him
the
sight
of
any
living
creature
in
petticoats
was
liable
to
set
his
hysterical
fancy
in
motion
every
woman
he
met
was
woman
of
the
millions
of
women
in
london
why
was
he
not
permitted
to
know
a
few
why
was
he
entirely
cut
off
there
they
were
their
silk
skirts
brushed
him
as
they
passed
they
thanked
him
for
little
services
in
public
vehicles
they
ministered
to
him
in
restaurants
they
sang
to
him
at
concerts
danced
for
him
at
theatres
touched
his
existence
at
every
side
and
yet
they
were
remoter
than
the
stars
unattainable
as
the
moon
he
rebelled
he
sank
in
despair
and
rose
to
frenzies
of
anger
then
he
was
a
pathetic
figure
and
extended
to
himself
his
own
pity
smiling
sardonically
at
fate
fate
was
the
harder
to
bear
because
he
was
convinced
that
at
the
heart
of
him
he
was
essentially
a
woman
man
none
could
enjoy
the
feminine
atmosphere
more
keenly
more
artistically
than
he
other
men
who
had
those
delicious
rights
for
which
he
longed
in
vain
assessed
them
meanly
or
even
scorned
them
he
looked
back
with
profound
regret
to
his
friendship
with
adeline
he
dreamt
that
she
had
returned
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
married
her
that
her
ambitions
were
leading
him
forward
to
success
ah
under
the
incentive
of
a
woman
eyes
of
what
tremendous
efforts
is
a
clever
man
not
capable
and
deprived
of
it
to
what
deeps
of
stagnations
will
he
not
descend
then
he
awoke
again
to
the
fact
that
he
knew
no
woman
in
london
yes
he
knew
one
and
his
thoughts
began
to
play
round
her
caressingly
idealising
and
ennobling
her
she
only
gave
him
his
change
daily
at
the
crabtree
but
he
knew
her
there
existed
between
them
a
kind
of
intimacy
she
was
a
plain
girl
possessing
few
attractions
except
the
supreme
one
of
being
a
woman
she
was
below
him
in
station
but
had
she
not
her
refinements
though
she
could
not
enter
into
his
mental
or
emotional
life
did
she
not
exhale
for
him
a
certain
gracious
influence
his
heart
went
forth
to
her
her
flirtations
with
aked
her
alleged
dalliance
with
jenkins
trifles
nothings
she
had
told
him
that
she
lived
with
her
mother
and
father
and
a
younger
brother
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
she
had
mentioned
the
wesleyan
chapel
he
had
gathered
that
the
whole
family
was
religious
in
theory
he
detested
religious
women
and
yet
religion
in
a
woman
what
was
it
he
answered
the
question
with
a
man
easy
laugh
and
if
her
temperament
was
somewhat
lymphatic
he
divined
that
once
roused
she
was
capable
of
the
most
passionate
feeling
he
had
always
had
a
predilection
for
the
species
of
woman
chapter
xxx
richard
was
soon
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
second
writing
of
his
novel
was
destined
to
be
a
failure
for
a
few
days
he
stuck
doggedly
to
the
task
writing
stuff
which
as
he
wrote
it
he
knew
would
ultimately
be
condemned
then
one
evening
he
stopped
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
word
bit
the
penholder
for
a
moment
and
threw
it
down
with
a
damn
this
sort
of
thing
could
not
continue
better
come
up
and
see
my
new
arrangements
at
raphael
street
he
said
to
jenkins
the
next
day
he
wanted
a
diversion
any
whisky
going
certainly
delighted
i
sure
said
jenkins
with
one
of
his
ridiculous
polite
bows
he
regarded
these
rare
invitations
as
an
honour
it
was
more
than
six
months
since
the
last
they
drank
whisky
and
smoked
cigars
which
jenkins
had
thoughtfully
brought
with
him
and
chattered
for
a
long
time
about
office
matters
and
then
as
the
accumulated
the
topics
became
more
personal
and
intimate
that
night
jenkins
was
certainly
in
a
serious
vein
further
he
was
on
his
best
behaviour
striving
to
be
sympathetic
and
gentlemanly
he
confided
to
richard
his
aspirations
he
wished
to
learn
french
and
proposed
to
join
a
polytechnic
institute
for
the
purpose
also
he
had
thoughts
of
leaving
home
and
living
in
rooms
like
richard
he
was
now
earning
shillings
a
week
he
intended
to
save
money
and
to
give
up
all
intoxicants
beyond
half
a
pint
of
bitter
a
day
richard
responded
willingly
to
his
mood
and
offered
sound
advice
which
was
listened
to
with
deference
then
the
talk
as
often
aforetime
drifted
to
the
subject
of
women
it
appeared
that
jenkins
had
a
desire
to
settle
down
he
was
he
knew
several
fellows
in
the
walworth
road
who
had
married
on
less
than
he
was
earning
what
about
miss
roberts
richard
questioned
oh
she
off
she
a
bit
too
old
for
me
you
know
she
must
be
look
here
my
boy
said
richard
i
do
believe
you
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
her
at
all
it
was
nothing
but
boasting
what
will
you
bet
i
ca
prove
it
to
you
jenkins
retorted
putting
out
his
chin
an
ominous
gesture
with
him
i
bet
you
no
a
shilling
done
jenkins
took
a
from
his
pocket
and
handed
richard
a
midget
photograph
of
miss
roberts
underneath
it
was
her
signature
yours
sincerely
laura
roberts
strange
to
say
the
incident
did
not
trouble
richard
in
the
least
he
walked
down
to
victoria
with
jenkins
towards
midnight
and
on
returning
to
his
lodging
thought
for
the
hundredth
time
how
futile
was
his
present
mode
of
existence
how
bare
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
of
what
avail
to
occupy
pretty
rooms
if
one
occupied
them
alone
coming
into
them
at
night
to
find
them
empty
leaving
them
in
the
morning
without
a
word
of
farewell
in
the
waste
of
london
laura
roberts
made
the
one
green
spot
he
had
lost
interest
in
his
novel
on
the
other
hand
his
interest
in
the
daily
visit
to
the
crabtree
was
increasing
as
day
succeeded
day
he
fell
into
a
practice
of
deliberately
seeking
out
and
magnifying
the
finer
qualities
in
her
nature
while
ignoring
those
which
were
likely
to
offend
him
indeed
he
refused
to
allow
himself
to
be
offended
he
went
so
far
as
to
retard
his
permanently
so
that
the
rush
of
customers
being
past
he
should
have
better
opportunity
to
talk
to
her
without
interruption
then
he
timidly
essayed
the
first
accents
of
courtship
and
finding
his
advances
accepted
grew
bolder
one
sunday
morning
he
met
her
as
she
was
coming
out
of
the
wesleyan
chapel
at
munster
park
he
said
the
encounter
was
due
to
accident
she
introduced
him
to
her
relations
who
were
with
her
her
father
was
a
big
stout
dark
man
dressed
in
black
with
a
heavy
beard
huge
chubby
fingers
and
jagged
grey
her
mother
was
a
spare
woman
of
sorrowful
aspect
whose
thin
lips
seldom
moved
she
held
her
hands
in
front
of
her
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
her
brother
was
a
lank
schoolboy
wearing
a
damaged
hat
shortly
afterwards
he
called
on
her
at
carteret
street
the
schoolboy
opened
the
door
and
after
inviting
him
as
far
as
the
lobby
vanished
into
a
back
room
only
to
reappear
and
run
upstairs
richard
heard
his
loud
agitated
whisper
laura
laura
here
larch
come
to
see
you
they
strolled
to
wimbledon
common
that
night
his
entity
seemed
to
have
become
dual
one
part
of
him
was
willingly
enslaved
to
an
imperious
headstrong
passion
the
other
stood
calmly
cynically
apart
and
watched
there
were
hours
when
he
could
foresee
the
whole
of
his
future
life
and
measure
the
bitter
ineffectual
regret
which
he
was
laying
up
hours
when
he
admitted
that
his
passion
had
been
as
it
were
artificially
incited
and
that
there
could
be
no
hope
of
an
enduring
love
he
liked
laura
she
was
a
woman
a
balm
a
consolation
to
all
else
he
obstinately
shut
his
eyes
and
casting
away
every
consideration
of
prudence
hastened
to
involve
himself
more
and
more
deeply
swiftly
swiftly
the
climax
approached
he
hailed
it
with
a
strange
affrighted
joy
chapter

they
were
upon
chelsea
embankment
in
the
late
dusk
of
a
saturday
evening
in
may
a
warm
and
gentle
wind
stirred
the
budding
trees
to
magic
utterances
the
long
straight
line
of
serried
lamps
stretched
away
to
an
enchanted
bridge
which
with
twinkling
lights
hung
poised
over
the
misty
river
the
plash
of
an
oar
came
languorously
up
from
the
water
and
the
voices
of
boys
calling
at
intervals
couples
like
themselves
passed
by
either
silent
or
conversing
in
low
tones
that
seemed
to
carry
inner
inarticulate
meanings
as
for
them
they
were
silent
he
had
not
her
arm
but
they
walked
close
together
he
was
deeply
and
indescribably
moved
his
heart
beat
heavily
and
when
he
looked
at
her
face
in
the
gloom
and
saw
that
her
eyes
were
liquid
it
beat
yet
more
heavily
then
lay
still
let
us
sit
down
shall
we
he
said
at
length
and
they
turned
to
an
empty
bench
under
a
tree
what
is
she
thinking
he
wondered
and
then
the
dominant
feeling
of
the
moment
possessed
him
wholly
his
ambitions
floated
out
of
sight
and
were
forgotten
he
remembered
nothing
except
the
girl
by
his
side
whose
maddening
bosom
rose
and
fell
under
his
very
gaze
at
that
moment
she
belonged
to
no
class
had
no
virtues
no
faults
all
the
inessentials
of
her
being
were
stripped
away
and
she
was
merely
a
woman
divine
desired
necessary
waiting
to
be
captured
she
sat
passive
expectant
the
incarnation
of
the
feminine
he
took
her
hand
and
felt
it
tremble
at
the
contact
a
thrill
ran
about
him
and
for
a
second
a
delicious
faintness
robbed
him
of
all
strength
then
with
inexplicable
rapidity
his
mind
went
unerringly
back
to
that
to
william
funeral
he
saw
the
cottage
in
the
fields
and
the
young
mother
half
robed
and
with
sleep
in
her
eyes
standing
at
the
door
exquisite
vision
he
heard
himself
speaking
laura
the
little
hand
gave
a
timorous
encouragement
laura
you
are
going
to
marry
me
the
intoxicating
pressure
of
her
lips
on
his
was
answer
heedless
of
publicity
he
crushed
her
against
his
breast
this
palpitating
creature
with
the
serious
face
ah
she
could
love
it
was
done
the
great
irretrievable
moment
had
gone
to
join
a
million
other
moments
of
no
significance
he
felt
triumphant
fiercely
triumphant
his
frightful
solitude
was
at
an
end
one
woman
was
his
a
woman
his
his
own
see
a
tear
quivered
in
her
eye
chapter
xxxii
sunday
was
stiflingly
hot
at
sloane
street
the
roof
of
every
putney
omnibus
was
already
laden
with
passengers
and
richard
on
his
way
to
carteret
street
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
laura
married
sister
milly
powell
her
husband
and
young
child
was
forced
at
last
to
be
content
with
a
seat
inside
the
public
houses
were
just
closing
for
the
afternoon
and
the
footpaths
full
of
with
here
and
there
a
girl
or
a
man
carrying
a
bible
no
vehicles
were
abroad
except
the
omnibuses
and
an
occasional
hired
carriage
which
passed
by
with
a
nonchalant
lazy
air
at
the
redcliffe
arms
there
got
in
a
little
family
party
consisting
of
a
stout
seemingly
prosperous
man
gruffly
his
wife
and
a
boy
of
about
three
years
whose
puffy
face
was
disfigured
by
large
spectacles
sit
here
milly
out
of
the
sun
the
man
said
curtly
richard
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
name
the
woman
likeness
to
laura
was
unmistakable
beyond
doubt
she
must
be
the
sister
of
his
betrothed
he
examined
her
curiously
she
was
perhaps
slightly
under
thirty
of
a
good
height
and
well
set
with
a
large
head
and
a
large
plain
face
her
movements
were
clumsy
she
appeared
to
be
just
upon
the
line
which
divides
the
matron
from
the
young
mother
in
both
her
features
and
her
attire
there
were
faint
reminders
of
girlish
grace
or
at
least
of
the
charm
of
the
shy
wife
who
nurses
her
her
complexion
was
clear
and
fresh
her
ears
small
and
delicately
pink
her
eyes
cool
grey
but
one
did
not
notice
these
beauties
without
careful
inspection
while
the
heavy
jaws
the
lax
eyelids
the
flattened
nose
whose
tilt
unpleasantly
revealed
the
nostrils
were
obvious
and
repellent
she
wore
a
black
gown
which
fitted
badly
imparting
an
ungainliness
probably
foreign
to
her
proper
figure
her
broad
hat
of
black
straw
trimmed
with
poppies
and
was
strikingly
modish
and
the
veil
running
at
an
angle
from
the
extremity
of
the
brim
down
to
her
chin
gave
to
her
face
a
cloistered
quality
which
had
its
own
seductiveness
her
small
hands
were
neatly
gloved
and
held
a
cheap
effective
parasol
the
woman
normal
expression
was
one
of
vacancy
but
now
and
then
her
eyes
would
light
up
as
she
spoke
to
the
child
gently
restraining
it
reassuring
it
rallying
it
with
simple
banter
she
was
still
in
love
with
her
husband
frequently
she
glanced
at
him
with
furtive
wistfulness
she
was
able
to
enjoy
the
summer
weather
she
was
not
quite
dead
to
the
common
phenomena
of
the
roadside
but
the
last
resistances
of
departing
youthfulness
and
vivacity
against
the
narcotic
of
a
dull
unlovely
domesticity
were
taking
place
in
a
year
or
two
she
would
be
the
typical
matron
of
the
lower
when
richard
had
made
these
observations
he
reflected
laura
will
be
like
that
soon
mentally
he
compared
the
two
faces
and
he
could
as
it
were
see
laura
changing
then
followed
a
reverie
which
embraced
the
whole
of
his
past
life
he
recognised
that
while
he
bore
all
the
aspect
of
prosperity
he
had
failed
why
had
nature
deprived
him
of
strength
of
purpose
why
could
not
he
like
other
men
bend
circumstances
to
his
own
ends
he
sought
for
a
reason
and
he
found
it
in
his
father
that
mysterious
dead
transmitter
of
traits
of
whom
he
knew
so
little
and
on
whose
name
lay
a
blot
of
some
kind
which
was
hidden
from
him
he
had
been
born
in
the
shadow
and
after
a
fitful
struggle
towards
emergence
into
the
shadow
he
must
again
retire
fate
was
his
enemy
mary
had
died
mary
would
have
helped
him
to
be
strong
aked
had
died
aked
inspiring
influence
would
have
incited
and
guided
his
efforts
adeline
had
abandoned
him
to
a
fatal
loneliness
he
knew
that
he
would
make
no
further
attempt
to
write
laura
was
not
even
aware
that
he
had
had
ambitions
in
that
direction
he
had
never
told
her
because
she
would
not
have
understood
she
worshipped
him
he
felt
sure
and
at
times
he
had
a
great
tenderness
for
her
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
write
in
the
suburban
which
was
to
be
theirs
no
in
future
he
would
be
simply
the
suburban
husband
dutiful
towards
his
employers
upon
whose
grace
he
would
be
doubly
dependent
keeping
his
house
in
repair
pottering
in
the
garden
taking
his
wife
out
for
a
walk
or
occasionally
to
the
theatre
and
saving
as
much
as
he
could
he
would
be
good
to
his
wife
she
was
his
he
wanted
to
get
married
at
once
he
wanted
to
be
master
of
his
own
dwelling
he
wanted
to
have
laura
kiss
when
he
went
out
of
a
morning
to
earn
the
he
wanted
to
see
her
figure
at
the
door
when
he
returned
at
night
he
wanted
to
share
with
her
the
placid
domestic
evening
he
wanted
to
tease
her
and
to
get
his
ears
boxed
and
be
called
a
great
silly
he
wanted
to
creep
into
the
kitchen
and
surprise
her
with
a
pinch
of
the
cheek
as
she
bent
over
the
range
he
wanted
to
whisk
her
up
in
his
arms
carry
her
from
one
room
to
another
and
set
her
down
breathless
in
a
chair
ah
let
it
be
soon
and
as
for
the
more
distant
future
he
would
not
look
at
that
he
would
keep
his
eyes
on
the
immediate
foreground
and
be
happy
while
he
could
after
all
perhaps
things
had
been
ordered
for
the
best
perhaps
he
had
no
genuine
talent
for
writing
and
yet
at
that
moment
he
was
conscious
that
he
possessed
the
incommunicable
imaginative
insights
of
the
author
but
it
was
done
with
now
the
conductor
called
out
their
destination
and
as
laura
sister
gathered
the
child
in
her
arms
he
sprang
out
and
hurried
down
carteret
street
in
order
to
reach
the
house
first
and
so
avoid
a
meeting
on
the
doorstep
he
heard
the
trot
of
the
child
behind
him
children
perhaps
a
child
of
his
might
give
sign
of
literary
ability
if
so
and
surely
these
instincts
descended
were
not
lost
how
he
would
foster
and
encourage
it
the
end
