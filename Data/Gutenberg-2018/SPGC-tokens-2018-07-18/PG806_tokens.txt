introduction
when
sophokles
produced
the
philoktetes
in
three
years
before
his
death
at
the
age
of
ninety
the
ancient
story
of
the
tragic
archer
abundantly
represented
in
greek
literature
achieved
a
dramatic
and
psychological
sophistication
of
a
kind
never
before
seen
on
the
classical
stage
the
theater
of
violent
action
and
suddenly
reversed
fortunes
the
oresteia
ajax
hippolytos
gave
way
for
a
brilliant
moment
to
a
strangely
quiet
contemplative
drama
that
centered
not
on
deeds
but
ideas
not
on
actions
but
words
foremost
among
sophokles
concerns
in
the
play
one
that
demanded
such
thoughtful
consideration
is
the
question
of
human
character
and
its
origins
indeed
the
philoktetes
might
well
be
regarded
as
the
first
literary
expression
of
what
has
been
termed
the
controversy
a
debate
that
continues
to
rage
in
the
closing
days
of
the
twentieth
century
in
his
drama
sophokles
places
himself
squarely
among
those
who
hold
that
one
character
is
determined
not
by
environment
or
custom
but
by
inborn
nature
physis
and
that
one
greatest
dishonor
is
to
act
for
whatever
end
in
ways
not
consonant
with
that
essence
the
tale
itself
reached
in
medias
res
is
uncomplicated
philoktetes
to
whom
the
demigod
herakles
bequeathed
his
magical
bow
is
recruited
by
the
achaean
generals
to
serve
in
the
war
against
troy
on
the
way
to
the
battle
philoktetes
in
the
company
of
odysseus
and
his
crew
puts
in
at
a
tiny
island
to
pray
at
a
local
temple
to
apollo
the
god
of
war
wandering
from
the
narrow
path
to
the
temple
philoktetes
is
bitten
by
a
sacred
serpent
the
warden
of
the
holy
precinct
the
wound
divinely
inflicted
as
it
is
and
not
admitting
of
mortal
healing
techniques
festers
and
philoktetes
fills
his
companions
days
with
an
unbearably
evil
stench
and
awful
cries
his
screams
of
agony
prevent
the
greeks
from
offering
proper
sacrifices
to
the
gods
the
ritual
utterance
eu
phemeton
from
which
our
word
euphemism
derives
means
not
speak
well
as
it
is
sometimes
translated
but
keep
silent
in
fitting
attitude
of
respect
finally
in
desperation
odysseus
never
known
as
a
patient
man
puts
in
at
the
desert
island
of
lemnos
and
there
casts
philoktetes
away
ten
years
of
savage
warfare
pass
whereupon
a
captured
trojan
oracle
helenos
reveals
to
the
greeks
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
overcome
troy
without
philoktetes
his
name
means
lover
of
possessions
and
his
magical
bow
ordered
to
fetch
the
castaway
and
escort
him
to
the
greek
battlefield
odysseus
in
keeping
with
his
trickster
nature
commands
his
lieutenant
neoptolemos
the
teenaged
son
of
the
newly
slain
achilles
to
win
philoktetes
over
to
the
greek
cause
by
treachery
promising
the
bowman
a
homeward
voyage
when
in
truth
he
is
to
be
bound
once
again
into
the
service
of
those
who
marooned
him
neoptolemos
is
surprised
at
this
turn
of
events
for
until
then
he
had
been
promised
that
he
alone
could
finish
his
father
work
and
conquer
troy
nonetheless
he
accepts
the
orders
of
odysseus
and
the
atreids
agamemnon
and
menelaos
here
lies
the
crux
of
the
tale
for
neoptolemos
learns
through
the
course
of
the
philoktetes
that
he
is
simply
unable
by
virtue
of
his
noble
birth
to
obey
the
roguish
odysseus
commands
his
ancestry
and
the
nature
it
has
given
him
do
not
permit
him
to
act
deceitfully
no
matter
what
profit
might
tempt
him
odysseus
on
the
other
hand
can
not
help
but
behave
treacherously
for
in
sophokles
account
it
is
in
his
base
slavelike
nature
to
do
so
the
resolution
of
neoptolemos
conflict
and
for
all
his
ambivalence
the
young
man
is
the
real
hero
of
the
story
forms
the
dramatic
heart
of
the
play
edmund
wilson
in
his
famous
essay
the
wound
and
the
bow
sought
to
read
the
philoktetes
as
sophokles
universal
statement
on
the
role
of
the
artist
in
society
wounded
outcast
lacking
some
inner
quality
that
might
permit
him
or
her
to
engage
in
the
mundane
events
of
life
whatever
the
considerable
merits
of
wilson
analysis
argued
with
great
sophistication
and
learning
in
the
end
to
read
the
bowman
as
a
suffering
artist
seems
more
an
act
of
anachronistic
than
the
drama
will
admit
instead
it
is
more
likely
that
a
brace
of
contemporary
events
propelled
sophokles
to
create
the
philoktetes
the
first
involves
a
curious
lawsuit
that
as
some
ancient
accounts
have
it
one
of
sophokles
sons
filed
against
him
charging
that
the
old
man
was
incapable
of
managing
his
affairs
and
that
his
estate
therefore
should
be
ceded
to
his
heir
sophokles
defense
consisted
entirely
of
a
recitation
from
oedipos
at
kolonos
the
masterpiece
he
was
then
composing
the
athenian
jury
instantly
dismissed
the
son
suit
holding
that
no
artist
of
such
readily
apparent
gifts
could
be
judged
senile
although
modern
scholars
doubt
the
authenticity
of
this
tale
it
surely
helps
explain
the
tragedian
preoccupation
in
his
final
years
with
the
origins
of
character
and
whether
a
noble
parent
could
in
fact
produce
ignoble
offspring
the
second
motivation
may
have
been
sophokles
scorn
for
the
rising
generation
of
athenian
aristocrats
trained
by
a
herd
of
eager
expensive
philosophers
those
whom
sokrates
reviled
in
his
apology
in
the
arts
of
sophistry
and
corruption
these
young
men
the
scions
of
reputedly
noble
families
quickly
proved
themselves
to
be
willing
to
bring
their
city
to
ruin
rather
than
surrender
any
of
the
privileges
of
their
class
they
argued
that
greatness
of
character
was
the
exclusive
province
of
the
aristocracy
to
which
they
belonged
and
that
no
man
women
did
not
enter
into
the
question
could
ever
hope
to
be
more
than
a
vassal
brutish
by
nature
and
situation
and
they
governed
athens
accordingly
destroying
the
constitutional
foundations
of
the
city
and
inaugurating
the
reign
of
terror
of
the
thirty
tyrants
under
whose
rule
some
athenian
democrats
the
noblest
minds
of
a
generation
were
executed
for
sophokles
these
actions
from
which
athens
was
never
able
to
recover
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
one
social
class
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
greatness
of
character
quite
the
reverse
it
must
have
seemed
but
by
the
time
he
had
crafted
the
philoktetes
the
humane
mature
culture
that
sophokles
represented
so
well
had
been
condemned
to
death
by
its
own
children
kenneth
rexroth
has
written
that
in
sophokles
work
men
suffer
unjustly
and
learn
little
from
suffering
except
to
answer
unanswerable
questions
with
a
kind
of
ultimate
courtesy
an
occidental
confucianism
that
never
pretends
to
solution
the
ages
following
sophokles
have
learned
from
him
the
definition
of
nobility
as
an
essential
aristocratic
irony
which
forms
the
intellect
and
sensibility
the
philoktetes
stands
as
a
splendid
application
of
that
ultimate
courtesy
addressing
timeless
problems
with
a
depth
of
emotion
and
tragic
beauty
that
is
unrivalled
in
the
literature
of
the
stage
in
particular
sophokles
use
of
the
chorus
as
the
tormented
inner
voice
of
conscience
is
without
peer
it
stands
as
one
of
the
great
accomplishments
of
the
greek
mind
a
striking
depiction
of
the
human
soul
rising
above
seemingly
insurmountable
hardships
to
manifest
its
nobility
one
of
the
fundamental
documents
in
the
history
of
the
imagination
philoktetes
is
alive
and
it
speaks
to
all
of
us

this
is

a
land
bound
by
waves
untrodden
lonely
here
i
abandoned
poias
son
philoktetes
of
melos
years
ago
neoptolemos
child
of
lord
achilles
the
greatest
by
far
of
our
greek
fighters
i
had
to
cast
him
away
here
our
masters
the
princes
commanded
me
to
for
disease
had
conquered
him
and
his
foot
was
eaten
away
by
festering
sores
we
had
no
recourse
at
our
holy
feasts
we
could
not
reach
for
meat
and
wine
he
would
not
let
us
sleep
he
howled
all
night
wilder
than
a
wolf
he
blanketed
our
camp
with
evil
cries
moaning
screaming
but
there
is
no
time
to
talk
of
such
things
no
time
for
long
speeches
and
explanations
he
might
hear
us
coming
and
foil
my
scheme
to
take
him
back
your
orders
are
to
serve
me
to
spy
out
the
cave
i
found
for
him
here
a
cave
exposed
to
the
sun
for
warmth
in
the
cold
months
admitting
cool
breezes
in
summer
heat
to
the
left
nearby
it
a
spring
if
it
is
still
sweet
if
he
still
lives
in
this
cave
or
another
place
then
i
reveal
more
of
my
plan
listen
both
of
us
have
been
charged
with
this
neoptolemos
lord
odysseus
what
you
speak
of
is
indeed
nearby
this
is
his
place
odysseus
where
above
or
below
us
i
can
not
tell
neoptolemos
above
and
with
no
sound
of
footsteps
or
talking
odysseus
go
and
see
if
he
sleeping
inside
neoptolemos
i
see
an
empty
dwelling
there
is
no
one
within
odysseus
and
none
of
the
things
that
distinguish
a
house
neoptolemos
a
pallet
of
trampled
leaves
as
if
for
a
bed
odysseus
and
what
else
is
there
nothing
more
inside
the
cave
neoptolemos
a
wooden
mug
carelessly
made
and
a
few
sticks
of
kindling
odysseus
so
this
is
the
man
empty
neoptolemos
look
here
rags
lie
drying
in
the
sun
full
of
pieces
of
skin
and
pus
from
his
sores
odysseus
then
clearly
he
still
lives
here
he
ca
be
far
off
weakened
as
he
is
by
long
years
of
disease
he
ca
stray
far
from
home
he
is
probably
out
scratching
up
a
meal
or
an
herb
he
knows
will
relieve
his
pain
send
a
guard
to
keep
close
watch
on
this
place
so
he
does
take
me
by
surprise
for
he
rather
have
me
than
any
other
greek
neoptolemos
the
path
will
be
guarded
now
tell
me
the
rest
odysseus
son
of
achilles
we
are
here
for
a
reason
you
must
be
like
your
father
and
not
in
strength
alone
if
any
of
this
sounds
strange
to
you
no
matter
you
must
still
serve
those
who
are
over
you
neoptolemos
what
must
i
do
odysseus
entangle
philoktetes
with
clever
words
in
order
to
trick
him
say
when
he
asks
you
i
am
achilles
son
there
no
lie
in
that
say
you
on
your
way
back
home
that
you
have
abandoned
the
greeks
and
all
their
ships
you
hate
them
so
speaking
to
him
piously
as
though
to
the
gods
of
olympos
tell
him
they
convinced
you
to
leave
your
home
by
swearing
that
you
alone
could
storm
troy
and
when
you
claimed
your
dead
father
weapons
as
is
your
birthright
say
they
scorned
you
called
you
unworthy
of
them
and
gave
them
to
me
although
you
had
been
demanding
them
say
whatever
you
want
to
against
me
say
the
worst
that
comes
to
mind
none
of
it
will
insult
me
if
you
do
not
match
this
task
you
will
cast
endless
sorrow
and
suffering
on
the
greeks
if
we
do
not
return
with
this
poor
man
bow
you
will
not
take
the
holy
city
of
troy
you
may
wonder
whether
you
can
do
this
safely
and
why
he
would
trust
you
i
tell
you
why
you
have
come
here
willingly
without
having
been
forced
and
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
happened
before
i
can
not
say
the
same
if
philoktetes
bow
in
hand
should
see
me
i
would
be
dead
in
an
instant
so
would
you
being
in
my
company
we
must
come
up
with
a
scheme
you
must
learn
to
be
cunning
and
steal
away
his
invincible
bow
i
know
son
that
by
nature
you
are
unsuited
to
tell
such
lies
and
work
such
evil
but
the
prize
of
victory
is
a
sweet
thing
to
have
go
through
with
it
the
end
justifies
the
means
they
say
for
a
few
short
shameless
hours
yield
to
me
from
then
on
you
be
hailed
as
the
most
virtuous
of
men
neoptolemos
son
of
laertes
what
pains
me
to
hear
pains
me
more
to
do
it
is
not
my
nature
as
you
say
to
take
what
i
want
by
tricks
and
schemes
my
father
as
i
hear
it
was
of
the
same
mind
i
will
gladly
fight
philoktetes
capture
him
and
make
him
our
hostage
but
not
like
this
how
can
a
man
alone
win
against
us
i
know
i
was
sent
to
carry
out
these
orders
i
do
not
want
to
make
things
hard
for
you
but
i
far
prefer
failure
if
it
is
honest
to
victory
earned
by
treachery
odysseus
you
are
the
son
of
a
great
and
noble
man
when
i
was
young
i
held
my
tongue
back
and
let
my
hand
do
my
work
now
as
you
tested
by
life
as
men
live
it
you
will
see
as
i
have
that
everywhere
it
is
our
words
that
win
and
not
our
deeds
neoptolemos
what
are
your
orders
apart
from
telling
lies
odysseus
i
order
you
to
capture
him
to
take
him
with
trickery
however
deceitful
neoptolemos
and
why
not
by
persuasion
after
telling
him
the
truth
odysseus
persuasion
is
impossible
so
is
force
neoptolemos
is
he
so
sure
of
his
strength
odysseus
yes
if
he
carries
his
unswerving
arrows
black
death
escorts
neoptolemos
even
to
meet
him
then
is
unsafe
odysseus
not
if
you
win
him
over
by
guile
as
i
have
said
neoptolemos
and
you
do
not
find
such
lying
disgusting
odysseus
not
if
a
lie
ends
with
our
salvation
neoptolemos
how
could
one
say
such
things
and
keep
a
straight
face
odysseus
what
you
do
is
for
our
gain
he
who
hesitates
is
lost
neoptolemos
what
good
would
it
do
me
for
him
to
come
to
troy
odysseus
only
philoktetes
can
conquer
the
city
neoptolemos
then
i
will
not
take
it
after
all
as
i
have
been
promised
odysseus
not
without
his
arrows
nor
they
without
you
neoptolemos
then
i
must
have
them
if
what
you
say
is
true
odysseus
you
will
bring
back
two
prizes
if
only
you
act
neoptolemos
what
are
they
if
i
know
i
will
not
refuse
the
deed
odysseus
you
will
be
called
wise
because
of
your
trick
and
brave
for
the
sack
of
troy
neoptolemos
then
let
it
be
so
i
will
do
what
you
order
putting
aside
my
sense
of
shame
odysseus
do
you
remember
all
the
counsel
i
have
given
neoptolemos
every
word
of
it
i
will
follow
it
all
odysseus
stay
here
at
the
cave
and
wait
for
him
i
will
leave
so
he
does
know
i
have
been
here
i
will
take
the
guard
and
go
back
to
the
ship
if
i
think
you
in
trouble
i
will
send
him
back
disguised
as
a

what

and
greatest
wisdom
falls

this
ancient
strength
has
come
all
the
power
of
your
ancestors
tell

what
must
be
done
to
serve
you
well
neoptolemos
look
now
without
any
fear
he
sleeps
on
the
seacliff
so
take
courage
when
he
awakes
it
will
be
terrible
muster
up
your
courage
and
aid
me
then
follow
my
lead
help
as
you
can
chorus
as
you
command
my
lord
neoptolemos
my
duty
to
you
is
always
first
in
my
thoughts
my
eye
is
fixed
on
your
best
interests
now
show
me
the
place
that
he
inhabits
and
where
he
sleeps
i
should
know
this
lest
he
take
me
in
ambush
i
am
frightened
and
yet
fascinated
as
though
by
a
snake
or
a
scorpion
lair
where
does
he
live
where
does
he
sleep
where
does
he
walk
is
he
inside
or
outside
neoptolemos
look
you
will
see
a
cave
with
two
mouths
that
is
his
house
that
is
his
rocky
chorus
where
is
he
now
the
unlucky
man
neoptolemos
it
is
clear
to
me
that
he
claws
his
way
to
find
food
nearby
he
struggles
now
to
bring
down
birds
with
his
arrows
to
fuel
this
wretched
way
of
life
he
knows
no
balm
to
heal
his
wounds
chorus
i
pity
him
for
all
his
woes
for
his
distress
for
his
loneliness
with
no
countryman
at
his
side
he
is
accursed
always
alone
brought
down
by
bitter
illness
he
wanders
distraught
thrown
off
balance
by
simple
needs
how
can
he
withstand
such
ceaseless
misfortune
o
the
violent
snares
laid
out
by
the
gods
o
the
unhappy
human
race
living
always
on
the
edge
always
in
excess
he
might
have
been
a
man
second
to
none
of
the
noble
greek
houses
now
he
has
no
part
of
the
good
life
and
he
lies
alone
apart
from
others
among
spotted
deer
and
shaggy
wild
goats
his
mind
is
fixed
on
pain
and
hunger
he
groans
in
anguish
and
only
a
babbling
echo
answers
poured
out
from
afar
in
answer
to
his
lamentations
neoptolemos
none
of
this
amazes
me
it
is
the
work
of
divine
fate
if
i
understand
rightly
savage
chryse
set
these
sufferings
on
him
the
share
of
sufferings
he
must
now
endure
his
torments
are
not
random
the
gods
surely
must
heap
them
on
him
so
that
he
can
not
bend
the
invincible
bow
until
the
right
time
comes
decreed
by
zeus
and
as
it
is
promised
troy
is
made
to
fall
chorus
be
quiet
boy
neoptolemos
what
is
it
chorus
a
clear
groan
the
steadfast
companion
of
one
walking
in
pain
where
is
it
now
comes
a
noise
a
man
writhes
along
his
path
from
afar
comes
the
sigh
of
a
burdened
man
the
cry
has
carried
pay
attention
boy
neoptolemos
to
what
chorus
to
my
second
explanation
he
is
not
so
far
away
he
is
inside
his
cave
he
is
not
walking
abroad
to
his
panpipe
doleful
song
like
a
shepherd
wandering
with
his
flocks
rather
he
has
bumped
his
wounded
leg
and
shouts
as
if
to
someone
far
away
as
if
to
someone
he
has
seen
at
the
harbor
the
cry
he
makes
is
terrible
philoktetes
you
there
you
strangers
who
are
you
who
have
landed
from
the
sea
on
an
island
without
houses
or
fair
harbor
from
what
country
should
i
think
you
and
guess
it
correctly
you
look
greek
to
me
you
wear
greek
clothes
and
i
love
to
see
them
i
want
to
hear
you
speak
my
tongue
do
not
shun
me
amazed
to
face
a
man
who
has
become
so
wild
pity
one
who
is
damned
and
alone
wasted
away
by
his
sufferings
speak
speak
if
you
come
as
friends
answer
me
it
is
unreasonable
not
to
answer
each
other
questions
neoptolemos
we
are
greeks
you
wanted
to
know
philoktetes
o
beloved
tongue
i
understand
you
that
i
should
hear
greek
words
after
so
many
years
who
are
you
boy
who
sent
you
what
brought
you
what
urged
you
here
what
lucky
wind
answer
let
me
know
who
you
are
neoptolemos
my
people
are
from
wavebound
skyros
an
island
i
am
sailing
homeward
i
am
called
neoptolemos
achilles
son
now
you
know
everything
philoktetes
son
of
a
man
whom
i
once
loved
son
of
my
beloved
country
nursed
by
ancient
lykomedes
what
business
brought
you
here
where
is
it
that
you
sail
from
neoptolemos
i
sail
from
troy
philoktetes
what
you
sail
away
from
troy
you
were
not
there
with
us
at
the
start
neoptolemos
did
you
take
part
in
that
misery
philoktetes
then
you
do
not
know
who
stands
before
you
neoptolemos
i
have
never
seen
you
before
how
could
i
know
you
philoktetes
you
do
not
know
my
name
the
fame
my
woes
have
given
me
the
men
who
brought
me
to
my
ruin
neoptolemos
you
see
one
who
knows
nothing
of
your
story
philoktetes
then
i
am
truly
damned
the
gods
must
surely
hate
me
for
not
even
a
rumor
to
have
come
to
greece
of
how
i
live
here
the
wicked
men
who
abandoned
me
keep
their
secret
then
and
laugh
while
the
disease
that
dwells
within
me
grows
and
grows
stronger
my
son
child
of
great
achilles
you
may
yet
have
heard
of
me
somehow
i
am
philoktetes
poias
son
the
master
of
herakles
weapons
agamemnon
menelaos
and
odysseus
marooned
me
here
with
no
one
to
help
me
as
i
wasted
away
with
a
savage
disease
struck
down
by
a
viper
hideous
bite
after
i
was
bitten
we
put
in
here
on
the
way
from
chryse
to
rejoin
the
fleet
and
they
cast
me
ashore
after
our
rough
passage
they
were
glad
to
see
me
fall
asleep
on
the
seacliffs
inside
this
cave
then
they
went
off
leaving
with
me
rags
and
breadcrumbs
and
few
of
each
may
the
same
soon
befall
them
think
of
it
child
how
i
awoke
to
find
them
gone
and
myself
left
alone
think
of
how
i
cried
how
i
cursed
myself
when
i
knew
my
ship
had
gone
off
with
them
and
not
a
man
was
left
to
help
me
overcome
this
illness
i
could
see
nothing
before
me
but
grief
and
pain
and
those
in
abundance
time
ran
its
course
i
have
had
to
make
my
own
life
to
be
my
own
servant
in
this
tiny
cave
i
seek
out
birds
to
fill
my
stomach
and
shoot
them
down
after
i
let
loose
a
tautly
drawn
bolt
i
drag
myself
along
on
this
stinking
foot
when
i
had
to
drink
the
water
that
pours
from
this
spring
in
icy
winter
i
had
to
break
up
wood
crippled
as
i
am
and
melt
the
ice
alone
i
dragged
myself
around
and
did
it
and
if
the
fire
went
out
i
had
to
sit
and
grind
stone
against
stone
until
a
spark
sprang
up
to
save
my
life
this
roof
if
i
have
fire
at
least
gives
me
a
home
gives
me
all
that
i
need
to
stay
alive
except
release
from
my
anguish
come
child
let
me
tell
you
of
this
island
no
one
comes
here
willingly
there
is
no
anchorage
here
nor
any
place
to
land
profit
in
trade
and
be
received
intelligent
people
know
not
to
come
here
but
sometimes
they
do
against
their
will
in
the
long
time
i
have
been
here
it
was
bound
to
happen
when
those
people
put
in
they
pitied
me
or
pretended
to
at
least
gave
me
new
clothes
and
a
bit
of
food
but
when
i
asked
for
a
homeward
passage
they
would
never
take
me
with
them
it
is
my
tenth
year
of
hunger
and
the
ravaging
illness
that
i
feed
with
my
flesh
the
atreids
and
odysseus
did
this
to
me
may
the
olympian
gods
give
them
pain
in
return
chorus
i
am
like
those
who
came
here
before
i
pity
you
unlucky
philoktetes
neoptolemos
and
i
am
a
witness
to
your
words
i
know
you
speak
truly
for
i
have
known
them
the
evil
atreids
and
violent
odysseus
philoktetes
do
you
too
have
a
claim
against
the
house
of
atreus
have
they
made
you
suffer
is
that
why
you
are
angry
neoptolemos
may
the
anger
i
carry
be
avenged
by
this
hand
so
that
mycenae
and
sparta
too
may
know
that
mother
skyros
bears
brave
men
philoktetes
well
spoken
boy
what
wrath
have
they
incited
in
you
neoptolemos
philoketetes
i
will
tell
you
everything
although
it
pains
me
to
remember
when
i
came
to
troy
they
heaped
dishonor
on
me
after
achilles
had
met
his
death
in
battle
philoktetes
tell
me
no
more
until
i
am
sure
i
heard
rightly
is
achilles
son
of
peleus
dead
neoptolemos
yes
dead
shot
down
by
no
living
man
but
by
a
god
so
i
been
told
he
was
laid
low
by
lord
apollo
arrows
philoktetes
the
two
were
noble
the
killer
and
the
killed
i
am
not
sure
what
to
do
now
to
hear
out
your
story
or
mourn
your
father
neoptolemos
it
seems
to
me
that
your
woes
are
enough
without
taking
on
the
woes
of
others
philoktetes
you
speak
rightly
now
tell
me
more
what
they
did
is
how
they
insulted
you
neoptolemos
they
came
for
me
in
their
mighty
warships
with
painted
prows
and
streaming
battle
flags
odysseus
and
my
father
tutor
were
the
ones
they
came
with
a
story
true
or
a
lie
that
the
gods
had
decreed
since
my
father
had
died
that
i
alone
could
storm
troy
walls
so
they
said
you
can
be
sure
that
i
lost
no
time
in
gathering
my
things
and
sailing
with
them
out
of
love
for
my
father
whom
i
wanted
to
see
before
the
earth
swallowed
him
i
had
never
seen
him
alive
and
i
would
be
proved
brave
if
i
captured
troy
we
had
a
good
wind
in
two
days
we
made
bitter
sigeion
a
mass
of
soldiers
raised
a
cheer
saying
dead
achilles
still
walked
among
them
they
had
not
yet
buried
him
i
wept
for
my
father
and
then
i
went
to
the
atreids
my
father
supposed
friends
as
was
fitting
and
i
asked
for
my
father
weapons
and
his
other
things
they
said
with
feigned
sorrow
son
of
achilles
you
may
have
the
other
things
but
not
achilles
weapons
those
now
belong
to
laertes
son
i
leapt
up
then
crying
in
grief
and
anger
and
said
you
bastards
how
dare
you
give
the
things
that
are
mine
to
other
men
without
asking
me
first
then
odysseus
who
happened
to
be
there
said
listen
boy
what
they
did
was
right
after
all
i
was
the
one
who
rescued
them
and
your
father
body
enraged
i
cursed
him
with
all
the
curses
i
could
think
of
leaving
nothing
out
curses
that
would
be
set
in
motion
if
he
were
truly
to
rob
me
odysseus
is
not
a
quarrelsome
man
but
what
i
said
stung
him
he
replied
boy
you
a
newcomer
you
have
been
at
home
out
of
harm
way
you
judge
me
too
harshly
you
can
not
keep
a
civil
tongue
for
all
that
you
will
not
take
his
weapons
home
you
see
i
took
abuse
from
both
sides
i
lost
the
things
that
were
mine
and
i
sailed
home
odysseus
the
bastard
son
of
bastards
robbed
me
but
i
blame
him
less
than
the
generals
they
rule
whole
cities
and
a
mighty
army
bad
men
become
so
by
watching
bad
teachers
i
have
told
you
all
may
he
who
hates
the
atreids
be
as
dear
to
the
gods
as
he
is
to
me
chorus
o
mountainous
mother
earth
mother
of
zeus
our
lord
himself
you
who
range
the
golden
paktolos
mother
of
pain
and
sorrow
i
begged
you
blessed
mother
borne
by
lions
on
that
day
when
the
arrogant
atreids
insulted
him
when
they
gave
away
his
weapons
to
the
son
of
laertes
hail
goddess
the
highest
object
of
our
awe
philoktetes
you
have
sailed
here
clearly
with
a
just
cause
of
pain
your
share
of
grief
almost
matches
mine
what
you
say
harmonizes
with
what
i
know
of
them
the
evil
doings
of
the
atreids
and
odysseus
i
know
that
odysseus
spins
out
lies
with
his
evil
tongue
which
he
uses
to
create
all
manner
of
injustice
he
brings
no
good
to
pass
i
know
still
it
amazes
me
to
learn
that
ajax
seeing
these
things
should
permit
them
neoptolemos
he
is
dead
now
friend
if
he
lived
they
would
never
have
stolen
the
weapons
from
me
philoktetes
so
ajax
too
is
dead
neoptolemos
dead
think
of
it
philoktetes
it
saddens
me
but
the
son
of
tydeus
and
odysseus
whom
sisyphos
i
have
heard
sold
to
laertes
they
who
merited
death
are
still
alive
neoptolemos
you
are
right
of
course
they
are
flourishing
they
live
in
high
glory
among
the
greeks
philoktetes
and
my
old
friend
that
honest
man
nestor
of
pylos
does
he
still
live
he
used
to
contain
their
evil
with
his
wise
counsel
neoptolemos
nestor
has
fallen
on
evil
times
his
son
antilochos
who
was
with
him
is
dead
philoktetes
o
you
have
told
me
of
two
deaths
that
hurt
me
most
what
can
i
hope
for
now
that
ajax
and
antilochos
are
dead
and
in
the
ground
while
odysseus
walks
while
he
should
be
the
one
who
is
dead
neoptolemos
that
one
is
a
clever
wrestler
still
even
the
clever
stumble
philoktetes
tell
me
by
the
gods
how
was
it
with
patroklos
your
father
most
beloved
friend
neoptolemos
he
was
dead
too
i
will
tell
you
in
a
word
what
happened
war
never
takes
a
bad
man
on
purpose
but
good
men
always
philoktetes
you
are
right
let
me
ask
you
then
of
one
who
is
worthless
but
cunning
and
clever
with
the
words
he
uses
neoptolemos
you
can
mean
only
odysseus
philoktetes
no
not
him
i
mean
thersites
who
was
never
content
to
speak
just
once
although
no
one
allowed
him
to
speak
at
all
is
he
alive
neoptolemos
i
do
not
know
him
but
i
have
heard
that
he
lives
philoktetes
he
would
be
no
evil
man
has
died
the
gods
it
seems
must
care
for
them
well
it
pleases
them
to
keep
villains
and
traitors
out
of
death
hands
but
they
always
send
good
men
out
of
the
living
world
how
can
i
make
sense
of
what
goes
on
when
praising
the
gods
i
discover
that
they
evil
neoptolemos
for
my
part
philoktetes
i
will
be
more
cautious
i
keep
watch
on
the
atreids
and
on
troy
from
afar
i
will
have
no
part
of
their
company
where
the
worse
is
stronger
than
the
better
where
noble
men
die
while
cowards
rule
i
shall
not
acquiesce
to
the
will
of
such
men
rocky
skyros
will
do
very
well
for
the
future
i
be
content
to
stay
at
home
now
i
go
to
my
ship
philoktetes
may
the
gods
keep
you
farewell
then
and
may
the
gods
lift
this
illness
from
you
as
you
have
long
wished
let
us
be
off
men
to
make
ready
for
sailing
when
the
gods
permit
it
philoktetes
are
you
leaving
already
neoptolemos
the
weather
is
clearing
opportunity
knocks
but
once
you
know
we
must
be
provisioned
and
ready
when
it
does
philoktetes
i
beg
you
by
your
father
by
your
dear
mother
by
all
you
have
ever
loved

i
am
not
important
to
you

of
me
anyway
i
know
that
i
will
be
a
troublesome
cargo
for
you
but
accept
that
to
you
and
your
noble
kind
to
be
cruel
is
shameful
to
be
decent
honorable
if
you
leave
me
it
will
make
for
an
awful
story
but
if
you
take
me
you
have
the
best
of
men
praise
that
is
if
i
live
to
see
oeta
fields

me
where
you
want
in

there
to
my

father
i
have
long
feared
that
he
is
dead

else
he
would
have
come
for
me
i
sent
prayerful
messages
to
him
through
travelers
who
happened
along
here
begging
him
to
come
himself
and
take
me
home
he
is
dead
then
or
more
likely

messengers
held
me
in
little

messengers
do

by

no

reproach
me
with
that

how
closely
you

bow
down

kiss
the
earth
in
gratitude
the
earth
of
my
home
that
is
no
home
look
inside

you
will
see
how
brave
i
must
be
by
my
very
nature
to
endure
even
the
sight
of
such
a
place
would
have
been
too
much
for
most
men
but
i
have
had
to
learn
to
withstand
its
evils
chorus
wait
and
watch
two
men
approach
one
of
our
crew
and
a
stranger
to

hear
from

the
shadows
hiding
his
words
from

speak
openly
do
not
hide
what
you
have
heard
trader
think
of
what
you
doing
boy
neoptolemos
i
have
been
thinking
trader
then
i
will
make
this
your
responsibility
neoptolemos
very
well
now
speak
trader
the
two
men
you
have
heard
of
tydeus
son
and
odysseus
hunt
for
philoktetes
they
are
bound
by
oath
to
bring
him
back
by
persuasion
or
naked
violence
and
all
the
greeks
heard
odysseus
swear
to
this
since
he
loudly
boasted
of
sure
success
neoptolemos
what
can
they
hope
to
win
those
men
to
turn
their
thoughts
after
so
many
years
to
philoktetes
whom
they
made
an
outcast
do
they
miss
him
now
or
have
the
gods
brought
vengeance
upon
them
since
they
punish
crime
trader
i
will
tell
you
you
may
not
know
this
story
there
was
a
seer
from
a
noble
family
one
of
priam
sons
in
fact
called
helenos
he
was
captured
one
night
on
a
reconnaissance
by
odysseus
himself
who
bears
all
our
curses
as
a
badge
of
dishonor
odysseus
tricked
him
and
paraded
him
before
the
whole
greek
army
helenos
then
poured
out
a
flood
of
prophesy
especially
about
troy
and
how
the
greeks
would
never
take
it
until
they
were
able
to
persuade
philoktetes
to
come
to
their
aid
after
he
had
been
rescued
from
this
place
the
minute
odysseus
heard
him
say
this
he
promised
to
fetch
this
man
either
by
persuasion
or
by
force
if
he
failed
he
said
they
could
punish
him
boy
now
you
know
why
i
urged
you
and
those
whom
you
care
for
to
leave
philoktetes
ah
he
swore
he
would
persuade
me
to
sail
off
with
him
the
bastard
he
sooner
persuade
me
to
come
back
from
the
grave
when
i
am
dead
to
rise
up
as
his
father
did
trader
i
do
know
that
story
i
must
leave
you
now
may
the
gods
help
you
all
philoktetes
is
it
shameful
boy
that
odysseus
thinks
his
words
are
wondrous
enough
to
persuade
me
to
let
him
cart
me
back
to
troy
and
parade
me
too
before
the
whole
greek
army
i
would
sooner
trust
my
enemy
the
viper
that
bit
me
and
crippled
me
at
chryse
let
him
try
what
he
will
now
that
i
know
he
coming
let
us
go
now
boy
and
hope
that
a
great
seaswell
will
rise
and
crest
and
keep
our
ship
from
odysseus
to
be
quick
at
the
right
occasion
you
know
makes
for
untroubled
sleep
when
work
is
done
neoptolemos
when
the
headwind
dies
down
we
will
sail
the
powers
of
the
air
work
against
us
now
philoktetes
whenever
you
flee
evil
men
that
is
good
sailing
neoptolemos
true
but
the
wind
is
against
them
as
well
philoktetes
in
the
minds
of
pirates
no
wind
is
against
them
so
long
as
they
can
steal
and
pillage
neoptolemos
let
us
go
away
then
fetch
from
your
cave
the
few
things
you
most
need
or
want
philoktetes
i
do
need
a
few
things
i
do
have
many
to
choose
from
neoptolemos
things
that
we
do
not
have
on
board
philoktetes
i
have
an
herb
to
ease
my
pain
to
put
it
to
sleep
neoptolemos
get
it
then
what
else
do
you
want
philoktetes
any
arrows
i
may
have
left
lying
around
i
can
not
leave
any
for
another
man
to
find
neoptolemos
is
that
your
famous
bow
philoktetes
yes
i
have
never
set
it
aside
neoptolemos
may
i
hold
it
may
i
cradle
it
in
my
hands
philoktetes
only
you
hold
it
and
take
whatever
is
useful
to
you
neoptolemos
i
would
love
to
hold
it
if
that
is
no
violation
if
it
is
lawful
if
not
let
it
be
philoktetes
you
speak
piously
child
it
is
lawful
for
you
alone
have
granted
me
the
light
of
the
sun
that
shines
above
us
and
the
sight
of
oeta
my
beloved
land
the
sight
of
my
father
and
of
my
dear
friends
you
have
taken
me
away
from
my
enemies
who
stood
above
me
courage
boy
hold
this
bow
then
give
it
back
to
me
and
proclaim
to
everyone
that
you
alone
could
hold
it
a
merit
won
by
strength
of
character
that
is
how
i
won
it
myself
for
an
act
of
kindness
long
ago
neoptolemos
i
am
glad
i
found
you
and
became
your
friend
one
who
knows
how
to
give
and
receive
kindness
is
a
friend
worth
more
than
any
possession
go
inside
philoktetes
come
inside
with
me
my
sickness
desires
to
have
you
alongside
as
its
helper
chorus
i
have
heard
the
story
although
i
did
not
see
it
myself
of
the
one
who
stole
up
to
zeus
bed
where
hera
slept
how
zeus
caught
him
and
chained
him
to
a
whirring
fiery
wheel
but
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
no
other
man
whom
destiny
treated
with
such
enmity
as
it
did
philoktetes
who
killed
no
one
nor
robbed
but
lived
justly
a
fair
man
to
all
who
treated
him
fairly
and
who
fell
into
evils
he
did
not
deserve
it
amazes
me
that
he
alone
listening
to
the
rushing
waves
pounding
on
the
shore
could
cling
to
life
when
life
brought
him
pain
and
so
many
tears
he
was
crippled
and
had
no
one
near
him
he
was
made
to
suffer
and
no
one
could
ease
his
burden
answer
his
cries
mourn
with
him
the
savage
illness
that
was
devouring
him
he
had
no
neighbor
to
gather
soft
leaves
to
staunch
the
bleeding
hideous
sore
that
ran
suppurating
maggoty
on
his
foot
he
writhed
and
scrawled
upon
the
hard
ground
crying
like
a
motherless
child
to
wherever
he
might
find
relief
when
the
illness
attacked
him
he
gathered
no
grain
sown
in
holy
earth
nor
the
food
that
living
men
enjoy
except
when
he
shot
his
feathered
arrows
and
filled
his
stomach
with
what
he
took
in
ten
years
he
has
had
no
succoring
wine
he
searched
for
puddles
and
drank
from
them
instead
but
now
fortune
has
come
with
victory
for
him
he
has
found
the
son
of
a
great
man
who
will
himself
be
great
when
this
is
over
our
lord
will
carry
him
over
the
seas
after
these
ten
years
to
his
father
home
in
the
land
of
the
nymphs
of
malia
by
the
banks
of
spercheios
where
herakles
the
archer
ascended
to
olympos
engulfed
in
holy
fire
there
above
the
hills
of
oeta
neoptolemos
come
on
then
if
you
want
to
why
do
you
stand
there
seized
by
silence
philoktetes
ah
ah
ah
neoptolemos
what
is
it
philoktetes
nothing
to
fear
come
now
boy
neoptolemos
does
your
illness
now
bring
you
pain
philoktetes
no
i
seem
to
be
better
now
o
gods
neoptolemos
why
do
you
cry
out
to
the
gods
in
anguish
philoktetes
i
cry
that
they
might
come
and
soothe
me
ah
ah

sears
through
my
blood

being
devoured
aaaah

my
foot

off
now

can
not
save
me
do
it
boy
neoptolemos
what
is
this
terrible
thing
that
attacks
you
and
makes
you
scream
in
such
misery
philoktetes
do
you
know
neoptolemos
what
is
it
philoktetes
how
can
you
not
know
aaaah
aaaah
neoptolemos

is
the
terrible
pain
the
disease

upon
you

more
than
words

tell
pity
me
neoptolemos
what
should
i
do
philoktetes
do
not
be
afraid
do
not
leave
me
the
disease
comes
and
goes
perhaps
when
it
has
gorged
itself
in
its
other
wanderings
neoptolemos
poor
man
you
have
endured
such
miseries
and
still
you
live
on
should
i
help
you
up
do
you
want
me
to
hold
you
philoktetes
of
all
things
do
not
touch
me
take
my
bow
instead
as
you
asked
a
while
ago
until
my
pain
diminishes
keep
the
bow
keep
it
safe
my
boy
sleep
overtakes
me
when
the
spell
has
passed
until
then
i
have
pain
you
must
let
me
sleep
for
a
while
if
my
enemies
come
while
i
lie
sleeping
i
beg
you
by
the
gods
do
not
give
up
my
bow
willingly
or
unwillingly
by
force
or
some
trick
if
you
do
boy
you
be
a
murderer
your
own
and
mine
your
suppliant
neoptolemos
do
not
worry
i
will
be
on
my
guard
no
one
but
we
will
touch
your
bow
give
it
to
me
now
and
may
the
gods
fortune
go
with
it
philoktetes
take
it
boy
pray
to
the
gods
lest
they
be
jealous
and
the
bow
become
your
sorrow
as
it
has
been
mine
and
its
former
master
neoptolemos
o
gods
grant
what
he
asks
and
grant
us
also
a
swift
journey
home
on
a
sheltering
wind
home
where
zeus
bids
us
to
go
philoktetes
your
prayer
i
afraid
will
be
in
vain
the
murderous
blood

your
pain
is
mine
philoktetes
no
boy
be
brave
the
disease
comes
quickly
and
leaves
me
with
equal
speed
i
beg
you
do
not
leave
me
here
neoptolemos
do
worry
we
will
stay
here
with
you
philoktetes
you
stay
neoptolemos
surely
philoktetes
i
find
it
unfitting
to
make
you
swear
to
it
neoptolemos
i
can
not
leave
this
place
without
you
philoktetes
give
me
your
hand
on
that
neoptolemos
i
give
it
to
you
and
with
you
it
stays
philoktetes
now
take
me
away
neoptolemos
what
do
you
mean
philoktetes
up
there
neoptolemos
what
madness
is
now
upon
you
why
do
you
look
at
the
summit
above
us
philoktetes
let
me
go
neoptolemos
where
philoktetes
let
me
go
neoptolemos
i
can
not
allow
it
philoktetes
touch
me
and
you
kill
me
neoptolemos
i
am
letting
go
you
are
saner
now
philoktetes
o
earth
take
my
body
from
me
now
the
illness
no
longer
allows
me
to
stand
neoptolemos
soon
i
think
sleep
will
overcome
him
he
nods
his
head
sweat
drenches
his
body
and
a
black
bitter
flood
of
pus
and
blood
has
broken
and
runs
from
his
foot
let
us
leave
him
to
sleep
friends
let
us
leave
him
quietly
chorus
sleep
stranger
to
pain
and
suffering
descend
upon
us
kindly
now
cover
his
eyes
with
your
radiance
come
down
healer
come
down
boy
look
now
at
where
you
stand
at
where
you
are
going
at
what
i
hold
for
the
future
do
you
see
him
he
sleeps
why
are
we
waiting
the
right
moment
decides
everything
and
wins
many
sudden
victories
neoptolemos
yes
he
hears
nothing
but
we
have
needlessly
hunted
captured
nothing
if
we
take
the
bow
and
sail
without
him
the
crown
of
victory
belongs
to
the
one
whom
zeus
commanded
that
we
bring
back
a
boast
that
can
not
be
carried
out
is
a
lie
that
boast
is
a
shameful
disgrace
chorus
zeus
will
attend
to
such
things
my
boy
answer
me
now
whisper
softly
the
sleep
of
a
sick
man
aware
of
all
things
sees
all
it
is
a
sleep
that
is
no
sleep
think
as
far
ahead
as
you
can
of
how
you
might
secretly
do
as
i
say
you
know
of
whom
i
am
thinking
now
if
your
decision
is
the
same
as
his
then
anyone
with
eyes
can
see
trouble
ahead
a
fair
wind
is
rising
the
man
is
blind
and
helpless
now
stretched
out
in
the
darkness
he
is
master
not
of
hand
not
of
foot
not
of
anything
he
is
one
lying
down
in
hades
chambers
look
to
see
if
the
time
is
right
for
what
you
intend
the
best
work
is
that
which
causes
no
fear
neoptolemos
quiet
now
have
you
lost
your
senses
the
man
eyes
are
opening
he
raises
his
head
philoktetes
blessed
is
the
light
that
follows
sleep
blessed
is
a
friend
protection
these
things
are
beyond
my
wildest
hopes
that
you
would
pity
me
and
care
for
my
sorrows
that
you
would
remain
by
me
and
endure
my
woes
the
atreids
the
noble
generals
would
not
do
this
they
would
have
no
tolerance
for
my
distress
your
nature
is
truly
noble
for
it
comes
from
noble
parents
you
took
this
burden
easily
a
burden
heavy
with
howls
and
foul
smells
now
i
can
put
aside
this
illness
i
can
rest
raise
me
up
in
your
arms
my
boy
put
me
on
my
feet
and
let
me
gather
my
strength
so
that
we
can
go
to
your
ship
and
sail
off
immediately
neoptolemos
i
am
glad
to
see
you
with
open
eyes
unpained
alive
your
symptoms
seemed
those
of
a
dead
man
when
taken
with
your
sufferings
arise
now
if
you
wish
these
men
will
lift
you
they
will
do
all
they
can
for
you
now
that
you
and
i
are
shipmates
philoktetes
thank
you
but
lift
me
up
yourself
as
you
once
suggested
do
not
trouble
the
men
let
the
stench
not
disturb
them
so
early
on
my
being
aboard
will
be
bother
enough
neoptolemos
stand
up
then
hold
on
to
me
philoktetes
no
need
i
am
used
to
it
once
i
am
up
i
can
manage
neoptolemos
it
is
time
what
must
i
do
philoktetes
your
words
stray
off
course
what
is
it
boy
neoptolemos
i
do
not
know
where
to
turn
my
powerless
words
philoktetes
powerless
do
not
say
such
things
neoptolemos
but
i
am
mired
in
powerless
thoughts
philoktetes
does
this
come
from
nausea
at
the
sight
of
my
illness
does
this
push
you
not
to
take
me
neoptolemos
everything
is
nauseating
to
one
who
casts
off
his
nature
to
do
things
that
are
out
of
character
philoktetes
it
would
not
have
been
out
of
character
for
your
father
the
man
who
gave
you
your
nature
to
help
a
good
man
both
in
word
and
in
deed
neoptolemos
i
will
be
shown
to
be
evil
the
very
thought
of
it
frightens
me
philoktetes
the
things
you
do
now
are
not
ignoble
the
words
you
speak
though
give
me
pause
neoptolemos
zeus
what
will
i
do
will
i
twice
be
proven
evil
hiding
what
i
should
not
saying
the
worst
philoktetes
if
i
am
not
a
poor
judge
it
seems
to
me
that
this
man
will
abandon
me
and
sail
away
neoptolemos
i
will
not
abandon
you
it
the
trip
you
be
making
that
will
be
ample
cause
for
grief
philoktetes
i
do
not
follow
you
what
are
you
saying
neoptolemos
i
wo
keep
it
from
you
any
longer
you
must
sail
to
troy
to
the
achaeans
to
the
armies
of
the
atreids
philoktetes
ah
what
are
you
saying
neoptolemos
do
not
groan
until
you
learn
philoktetes
what
must
i
learn
what
are
you
planning
to
do
with
me
neoptolemos
first
to
cure
you
of
this
misery
then
you
and
i
will
destroy
the
trojan
nation
philoktetes
is
this
the
truth
is
this
what
you
wanted
neoptolemos
a
great
need
forces
these
things
upon
us
quell
your
anger
philoktetes
i
am
destroyed
i
am
betrayed
why
stranger
have
you
done
these
things
give
me
back
my
bow
neoptolemos
i
can
not
duty
and
my
own
ambition
force
me
to
obey
those
men
who
command
me
philoktetes
o
fire
o
utter
terror
o
terrible
craftsman
of
all
wickedness
the
things
you
have
done
to
me
how
you
have
betrayed
me
are
you
not
ashamed
to
look
down
on
me
who
have
kneeled
to
you
the
suppliant
you
bitter
ones
you
have
taken
away
my
life

my
bow

i
beg
you
boy

it
now
by
your
ancestral
gods

away
as
though
he
will
never
give
it
back
caves
promontories
hordes
of
wild
beasts
rocky

i
speak
to
you
now
for
there

no
one

whom
i
can
speak
you
have
always
been
at
my
side
and
heard
me
hear
what
achilles
son
has
done
he
promised
to
take
me
home
instead
he
will
take
me
to
troy
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
then
robbed
me
of
my
holy
bow
herakles
bow
the
son
of
zeus
to
hold
it
up
to
the
greeks
and
boast
that
he
had
taken
it
from
a
strong
opponent
that
he
had
taken
it
from
his
prisoner
he
is
killing
someone
who
is
already
dead

corpse
a
smoky
shadow
a
ghost

would
not
have
won
even
so
he
had
to
trick
me
to
get
it
away
i
have
been
tricked
and
i
am
destroyed

and
i
am
nothing

come
back
to
you
unarmed
unable
to
capture
my
sustenance
within
that
cave
i
will
wither
unable
to
bring
down
birds
or
beasts
from
the
mountains
with
my
bow
now
i
will
be
the
food
of
those
who
fed
me
those
i
hunted
once
will
hunt
me
now
i
will
repay
with
my
life
the
lives
i
took
because
of
the
hypocrite
i
took
into
my
trust
a
boy
who
seemed
to
know
no
evil
a
curse
upon
you
no
not
until
i
know
if
you
change
your
mind
if
you
will

you
die
in
all
misery

by
hephaistos
in
the
great
volcano

go
with
them
odysseus
zeus

this
island
zeus
has
ordered
this
i
am
his
servant
i
obey
his
commands
philoktetes
o
despicable
man
the
lies
you
spin
you

say
no
odysseus
and
i
say
yes
you
must
obey
philoktetes
clearly
we
are
slaves
and
not
freeborn
men
this
is
what
our
fathers
brought
us
up
to
be
odysseus
no
as
equals
of
the
noblest
men
with
whom
you
must
storm
troy
walls
and
demolish
the
city
as
destiny
proclaims
philoktetes
no
i
do
anything
but
that
odysseus
i
still
have
my
seacliff
odysseus
what
did
you
have
in
mind
philoktetes
to
throw
myself
from
the
rocks
above
and
break
myself
on
the
rocks
below
odysseus
take
him
keep
him
from
jumping
philoktetes
o

what
you
suffer
for
lack
of
a
bowstring
the
prey
of
that
man
you
whose
thoughts
are
sick
and
slavelike
how
you
have
hunted
me
how
you
tricked
me
how
you
stole
up
with
this
boy
as
a
shield
unknown
to
me
he
deserved
a
better
master
than
you
he
is
at
a
loss
to
do
anything
but
what
he
told
and
he
suffers
now
for
his
mischief
and
the
things
he
has
brought
upon
my
head
your
evil
harmful
soul
has
taught
him
to
be
a
wily
criminal
unwilling
and
unsuited
though
he
was
for
that
now
you
have
bound
me
and
plan
to
take
me
off
from
this
place
where
you
had
cast
me
away
friendless
homeless
a
living
corpse
i
curse
you
i
have
cursed
you
many
times
before
but
the
gods
have
granted
me
nothing
i
want
and
so
you
live
happily
while
i
live
in
this
pain
and
you
and
the
atreids
mock
my
anguish
those
two
generals
for
whom
you
perform
this
deed
you
were
yoked
to
the
cause
by
deceit
and
force
while
i
willingly
went
with
my
seven
ships
willingly
to
dishonor
and
my
own
destruction
to
being
cast
away
on
this
lonely
shore
you
say
they
did
it
and
they
blame
you
why
must
you
take
me
i
am
nothing
for
you
i
been
dead
for
years
blasphemous
man
could
it
be
i
do
stink
now
am
i
no
longer
a
cripple
if
i
sail
with
you
how
can
you
offer
burnt
sacrifices
how
can
you
pour
your
libations
to
the
gods
that
was
your
reason
for
abandoning
me
may
a
horrible
death
overtake
you
it
will
for
your
crimes
against
me
if
the
gods
still
care
for
justice
i
know
they
do
for
you
would
not
have
come
for
my
sake
alone
the
gods
urging
must
have
brought
you
here
ancestral
land
and
you
gods
who
look
on
mortal
crimes
take
vengeance
on
these
men
when
the
time
is
right
take
vengeance
on
them
all
if
you
pity
me
if
i
could
see
them
die
then
i
could
also
dream
that
the
sickness
within
me
has
fled
my
body
chorus
he
is
bitter
this
stranger
his
words
are
too
for
they
do
not
bend
to
suffering
odysseus
there
is
no
time
to
say
the
things
i
should
and
there
are
many
things
i
could
say
to
him
just
this
i
am
a
man
who
responds
to
occasion
and
adapts
himself
to
the
situation
in
times
of
crisis
among
good
and
just
men
i
can
be
the
of
all
to
win

we
need
you

look
at
him
even

spirit
prompts
you
to
that
may
destroy

advantage
we
have
won

you
leave
me

you
have
no

the
young
lord

neoptolemos
odysseus
will
chide
me
for
pitying
him
you
men
stay
here
until
the
other
sailors
make
ready
and

have
prayed
to
the
gods
of
this
place

better

sadness

mine

am
broken

who
deserted
your
holy
waters

the
greeks
my
enemies
i
am
nothing
now
chorus
i
should
have
been
back
to
the
ship
by
now
here
comes
odysseus
with
the
son
of
achilles
odysseus
why
are
you
returning
so
quickly
boy
neoptolemos
i
hurry
to
undo
the
evil
i
have
done
odysseus
you
speak
strangely
what
evil
is
that
neoptolemos
i
was
wrong
to
obey
you
and
the
generals
odysseus
what
did
we
order
you
to
do
that
was
wrong
neoptolemos
i
worked
guile
and
deceit
and
successfully
odysseus
what
more
do
you
want
now
neoptolemos
nothing
new
i
have
philoktetes
bow
odysseus
and
what
will
you
do
with
it
i
am
afraid
to
ask
neoptolemos
i
am
giving
it
back
to
its
rightful
owner
odysseus
you
mean
you
return
it
neoptolemos
yes
i
got
it
by
shameful
tricks
odysseus
do
you
really
mean
it
neoptolemos
i
am
telling
the
truth
odysseus
what
are
you
saying
son
of
achilles
neoptolemos
must
we
go
over
the
same
ground
twice
odysseus
i
wish
we
had
not
gone
over
it
the
first
time
neoptolemos
you
have
heard
everything
now
odysseus
someone
will
keep
you
from
doing
it
neoptolemos
who
odysseus
the
whole
greek
army
and
i
among
them
neoptolemos
you
are
clever
odysseus
but
what
you
say
is
not
odysseus
neither
your
words
nor
your
acts
are
clever
neoptolemos
but
they
are
just
that
is
better
odysseus
how
can
it
be
just
to
give
away
what
you
have
won
with
my
counsel
neoptolemos
i
have
committed
injustice
and
strayed
off
course
i
must
undo
all
that
odysseus
and
you
have
no
fear
of
what
the
greeks
will
do
neoptolemos
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
of
you
since
i
act
with
justice
you
will
not
force
me
odysseus
then
we
will
fight
not
troy
but
you
neoptolemos
so
be
it
odysseus
do
you
see
my
hand
drawing
out
this
sword
neoptolemos
you
see
me
do
the
same
and
right
away
odysseus
i
will
leave
you
to
it
then
i
return
to
troy
and
tell
the
greeks
and
they
will
come
here
to
punish
you
neoptolemos
it
is
a
cautious
thing
you
do
remain
as
cautious
and
perhaps
you
keep
clear
of
future
danger
philoktetes
son
of
poias
come
out
of
your
cave
i
call
on
you
philoktetes
what
do
you
want
why
do
you
call
me
it
bodes
ill
some
new
trouble
is
at
hand
some
new
grief
to
heap
on
my
miseries
neoptolemos
be
calm
i
simply
ask
that
you
listen
philoktetes
i
listened
to
you
once
and
you
spoke
well
then
my
troubles
came
from
sweet
words
when
i
believed
them
neoptolemos
is
it
not
possible
then
to
apologize
philoktetes
you
spoke
as
smoothly
as
you
do
now
when
you
stole
my
bow
trustworthy
on
the
surface
but
treacherous
below
neoptolemos
that
is
not
the
case
now
are
you
resolved
to
stay
here
as
before
or
will
you
come
with
us
philoktetes
stop
your
words
will
be
wasted
on
me
neoptolemos
are
you
resolved
philoktetes
more
resolved
than
words
can
say
neoptolemos
i
wish
that
i
could
make
you
change
your
mind
but
if
my
words
are
pointless
then
i
am
finished
philoktetes
your
words
are
useless
you
will
never
win
me
with
words
to
your
friendship
you
have
destroyed
me
with
deceitful
talk
and
then
you
come
to
make
speeches
bastard
son
of
a
noble
father
a
curse
on
you
on
the
atreids
and
odysseus
but
especially
on
you
neoptolemos
curse
no
more
take
your
bow
i
give
it
back
to
you
now
philoktetes
philoktetes
is
this
yet
another
of
your
tricks
neoptolemos
no
i
swear
it
by
almighty
zeus
philoktetes
your
words
are
good
if
they
are
true
neoptolemos
they
are
reach
out
and
take
the
bow
odysseus
i
forbid
you
as
the
gods
are
my
witnesses
in
the
name
of
the
atreids
and
all
their
armies
philoktetes
boy
whose
voice
is
that
odysseus
odysseus
none
other
and
very
near
you
now
i
will
bring
you
to
wide
troy
myself
against
your
will
whether
or
not
the
boy
approves
philoktetes
you
will
suffer
for
your
words
if
this
arrow
flies
true
neoptolemos
do
shoot
by
the
gods
philoktetes
let
go
of
my
hand
now
boy
neoptolemos
no
i
will
not
let
go
philoktetes
why
do
you
keep
me
from
killing
my
enemy
neoptolemos
it
would
not
be
a
brave
act
for
you
or
me
philoktetes
the
lords
of
the
army
the
false
heralds
of
the
greeks
are
cowards
in
battle
however
brave
their
words
neoptolemos
that
may
well
be
you
have
your
bow
you
have
no
further
cause
to
be
angry
with
me
philoktetes
no
you
have
shown
your
true
nobly
bred
nature
you
are
the
son
of
achilles
not
sisyphos
your
father
when
he
lived
was
the
most
famous
man
of
all
and
now
he
is
most
the
famous
of
the
dead
neoptolemos
it
pleases
me
to
hear
you
speak
kindly
of
my
father
and
of
me
now
listen
to
what
i
want
from
you
the
gods
will
is
given
to
us
mortals
and
we
must
bear
that
will
of
necessity
and
those
who
choose
to
clutch
their
miseries
and
not
release
them
deserve
no
pity
you
have
become
a
savage
through
your
anger
you
refuse
good
advice
and
hate
him
who
offers
it
as
though
he
were
your
enemy
i
will
speak
freely
may
zeus
god
of
vows
be
my
witness
listen
to
me
let
my
words
be
engraved
in
your
mind
you
are
diseased
and
your
pain
has
been
sent
by
the
gods
because
you
came
close
to
the
guardian
of
chryse
the
viper
who
silently
watches
over
her
roofless
temple
to
keep
invaders
out
your
pain
will
have
no
relief
in
this
place
where
this
sun
rises
and
this
sun
sets
you
must
first
go
willingly
with
us
to
troy
and
there
be
taken
by
the
asklepiades
who
will
relieve
your
disease
and
then
beside
me
you
must
take
your
bow
and
conquer
troy
i
know
that
it
must
be
this
way
a
trojan
man
was
taken
prisoner
his
name
is
helenos
and
he
is
a
trustworthy
prophet
he
told
us
of
how
this
year
it
would
pass
how
it
was
fated
that
troy
would
fall
to
the
greeks
if
he
was
wrong
he
said
then
we
should
kill
him
you
know
it
all
now
yield
and
obey
you
will
get
much
more
than
you
asked
for
you
will
be
healed
by
knowing
hands
and
then
you
will
gain
the
greatest
glory
of
our
people
becoming
the
most
famous
of
us
all
conquering
troy
the
city
that
has
drained
us
of
blood
and
tears
philoktetes
hateful
life
why
should
i
still
live
and
see
why
have
i
not
descended
into
darkness
what
will
i
do
how
can
i
mistrust
the
one
who
gives
me
this
kindly
advice
must
i
give
in
if
i
do
how
shall
i
go
into
the
light
an
outcast
mistreated
to
whom
should
i
talk
my
eyes
can
you
bear
to
see
me
living
alongside
those
who
tried
to
kill
me
the
atreids
and
that
bastard
odysseus
i
worry
not
about
the
evils
they
have
done
but
the
evils
they
will
do
as
these
things
unfold
once
men
have
learned
to
hatch
evil
crimes
they
can
not
help
but
be
criminals
again
i
wonder
and
i
keep
on
wondering
you
should
not
be
going
off
to
troy
and
you
should
keep
me
from
going
there
those
men
have
wronged
you
robbed
you
of
your
father
weapons
will
you
still
help
them
and
make
me
do
the
same
no
take
me
home
as
you
have
promised
and
then
stay
in
skyros
let
these
men
die
badly
as
they
deserve
your
father
and
i
will
be
grateful
to
you
for
by
helping
the
wicked
you
become
like
them
neoptolemos
your
words
have
merit
still
you
must
trust
the
gods
and
my
word
and
come
as
my
friend
philoktetes
come
to
the
bitter
plains
of
troy
to
the
accursed
atreids
with
my
foot
like
this
neoptolemos
no
not
to
enemies
but
to
those
who
can
help
who
can
save
you
and
your
foot
from
this
savage
disease
philoktetes
what
you
urge
is
terrible
can
i
believe
what
you
tell
me
neoptolemos
it
will
be
to
our
mutual
benefit
philoktetes
are
you
not
ashamed
to
talk
so
in
full
sight
of
the
gods
neoptolemos
why
should
i
feel
shame
to
do
acts
of
good
philoktetes
acts
of
good
for
me
or
the
atreids
neoptolemos
i
am
your
friend
my
words
are
of
friendship
philoktetes
how
will
you
betray
me
to
my
enemies
neoptolemos
you
must
learn
to
extract
yourself
from
this
anguish
philoktetes
your
words
are
clear
you
intend
to
destroy
me
neoptolemos
no
you
have
not
understood
philoktetes
is
it
not
true
that
the
atreids
marooned
me
here
neoptolemos
once
they
marooned
you
let
us
see
if
they
save
you
philoktetes
not
if
salvation
means
going
to
troy
neoptolemos
what
will
we
do
then
since
i
can
not
convince
you
it
is
better
it
seems
that
i
stop
talking
and
you
go
on
living
without
hope
of
a
cure
philoktetes
let
me
suffer
the
things
i
must
but
what
you
promised
touching
my
hand
you
must
do
take
me
home
without
delay
forget
troy
i
am
tired
of
lamenting
here
neoptolemos
all
right
let
us
sail
philoktetes
you
speak
nobly
neoptolemos
plant
your
feet
firmly
and
arise
philoktetes
i
will
do
so
as
firmly
as
i
am
able
neoptolemos
how
will
i
avoid
the
scorn
of
the
greeks
philoktetes
pay
it
no
mind
neoptolemos
and
what
if
they
come
in
war
against
my
country
philoktetes
i
will
be
with
you
neoptolemos
what
kind
of
help
could
you
give
me
philoktetes
the
help
of
herakles
bow
neoptolemos
what
do
you
mean
philoktetes
i
will
drive
them
out
of
your
fatherland
neoptolemos
if
you
will
do
this
then
come
and
kiss
this
ground
and
we
will
go
herakles
not
yet
not
until
you
have
heard
me
philoktetes

that
i
am
the
voice
of
herakles

it
with
your
ears
and

body

have
come
from
the
dead
to
give
you
my
help

the
journey

fate

you
of
the
hardships
and
sufferings
that
were
mine
and
of
the
undying
fame
that
i
later
won
i
gained
immortality

you
can
see
so
will
you
after
all
this
misery
you
will
have
endless
glory
go
with
this
child
to
the
plains
of
troy
there

will
have
a
cure
for
your
disease
and
win
fame
as
the
best
of
the
greek
warriors
you
will
kill
paris
alexander

started
it
all

will
kill
him

your
bow

will
conquer
troy
you
will
win
the
prize
of
glory
from
the
armies
and
spoils
of
war

you
will
take
home
to
poias
your
father
and
oeta
your
country

some
of
those
spoils

offering
on
a
pyre
in
commemoration
of
my
bow
son
of
achilles

me
too
you

are
not
strong
enough
to
conquer
troy
not
without
this
man
nor
he
without
you
you
must
act
like
two
lions
in
a
pride
guarding
each
other
as
you
hunt
i
will
send
asklepios
to
troy
to
heal
his
disease
troy
will
fall
twice
before

bow

this
though
when
you
go
to

voice
that
moves

cave
that
shared
my
watch
nymphs
of
the
farewell
thundering
beat
of
waves
on
the
headland
that
wetted
my
head
with
spray
on
the
cliffs
and
the
volcano
that
groaned
in
echo
to
my
voice
when
i
was
tossed
by
storms
springs
and
the
well
of
lykeios
i
leave
you
i
had
lost
all
hope
of
doing
so
farewell
lemnos
bound
by
waves
give
me
no
further
cause
to
mourn
but
send
me
off
on
fair
seas
to
win
my
glory
where
fate
now
carries
me
to
the
judgment
of
friends
and
the
spirit
that
rules
these
events
chorus

us
all
go
now
after
we
have
prayed
to
the
nymphs
of
the
sea
to
grant
us
safe
passage
over
the
waters
