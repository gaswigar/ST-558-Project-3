chapter
vi
well
pretty
soon
the
old
man
was
up
and
around
again
and
then
he
went
for
judge
thatcher
in
the
courts
to
make
him
give
up
that
money
and
he
went
for
me
too
for
not
stopping
school
he
catched
me
a
couple
of
times
and
thrashed
me
but
i
went
to
school
just
the
same
and
dodged
him
or
outrun
him
most
of
the
time
i
did
want
to
go
to
school
much
before
but
i
reckoned
i
go
now
to
spite
pap
that
law
trial
was
a
slow
business
appeared
like
they
war
ever
going
to
get
started
on
it
so
every
now
and
then
i
borrow
two
or
three
dollars
off
of
the
judge
for
him
to
keep
from
getting
a
cowhiding
every
time
he
got
money
he
got
drunk
and
every
time
he
got
drunk
he
raised
cain
around
town
and
every
time
he
raised
cain
he
got
jailed
he
was
just
suited
this
kind
of
thing
was
right
in
his
line
he
got
to
hanging
around
the
widow
too
much
and
so
she
told
him
at
last
that
if
he
did
quit
using
around
there
she
would
make
trouble
for
him
well
was
he
mad
he
said
he
would
show
who
was
huck
finn
boss
so
he
watched
out
for
me
one
day
in
the
spring
and
catched
me
and
took
me
up
the
river
about
three
mile
in
a
skiff
and
crossed
over
to
the
illinois
shore
where
it
was
woody
and
there
war
no
houses
but
an
old
log
hut
in
a
place
where
the
timber
was
so
thick
you
could
find
it
if
you
did
know
where
it
was
he
kept
me
with
him
all
the
time
and
i
never
got
a
chance
to
run
off
we
lived
in
that
old
cabin
and
he
always
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
under
his
head
nights
he
had
a
gun
which
he
had
stole
i
reckon
and
we
fished
and
hunted
and
that
was
what
we
lived
on
every
little
while
he
locked
me
in
and
went
down
to
the
store
three
miles
to
the
ferry
and
traded
fish
and
game
for
whisky
and
fetched
it
home
and
got
drunk
and
had
a
good
time
and
licked
me
the
widow
she
found
out
where
i
was
by
and
by
and
she
sent
a
man
over
to
try
to
get
hold
of
me
but
pap
drove
him
off
with
the
gun
and
it
war
long
after
that
till
i
was
used
to
being
where
i
was
and
liked
it
all
but
the
cowhide
part
it
was
kind
of
lazy
and
jolly
laying
off
comfortable
all
day
smoking
and
fishing
and
no
books
nor
study
two
months
or
more
run
along
and
my
clothes
got
to
be
all
rags
and
dirt
and
i
did
see
how
i
ever
got
to
like
it
so
well
at
the
widow
where
you
had
to
wash
and
eat
on
a
plate
and
comb
up
and
go
to
bed
and
get
up
regular
and
be
forever
bothering
over
a
book
and
have
old
miss
watson
pecking
at
you
all
the
time
i
did
want
to
go
back
no
more
i
had
stopped
cussing
because
the
widow
did
like
it
but
now
i
took
to
it
again
because
pap
no
objections
it
was
pretty
good
times
up
in
the
woods
there
take
it
all
around
but
by
and
by
pap
got
too
handy
with
his
and
i
could
stand
it
i
was
all
over
welts
he
got
to
going
away
so
much
too
and
locking
me
in
once
he
locked
me
in
and
was
gone
three
days
it
was
dreadful
lonesome
i
judged
he
had
got
drowned
and
i
was
ever
going
to
get
out
any
more
i
was
scared
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
fix
up
some
way
to
leave
there
i
had
tried
to
get
out
of
that
cabin
many
a
time
but
i
could
find
no
way
there
war
a
window
to
it
big
enough
for
a
dog
to
get
through
i
could
get
up
the
chimbly
it
was
too
narrow
the
door
was
thick
solid
oak
slabs
pap
was
pretty
careful
not
to
leave
a
knife
or
anything
in
the
cabin
when
he
was
away
i
reckon
i
had
hunted
the
place
over
as
much
as
a
hundred
times
well
i
was
most
all
the
time
at
it
because
it
was
about
the
only
way
to
put
in
the
time
but
this
time
i
found
something
at
last
i
found
an
old
rusty
without
any
handle
it
was
laid
in
between
a
rafter
and
the
clapboards
of
the
roof
i
greased
it
up
and
went
to
work
there
was
an
old
nailed
against
the
logs
at
the
far
end
of
the
cabin
behind
the
table
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
through
the
chinks
and
putting
the
candle
out
i
got
under
the
table
and
raised
the
blanket
and
went
to
work
to
saw
a
section
of
the
big
bottom
log
out
big
enough
to
let
me
through
well
it
was
a
good
long
job
but
i
was
getting
towards
the
end
of
it
when
i
heard
pap
gun
in
the
woods
i
got
rid
of
the
signs
of
my
work
and
dropped
the
blanket
and
hid
my
saw
and
pretty
soon
pap
come
in
pap
war
in
a
good
humor
so
he
was
his
natural
self
he
said
he
was
down
town
and
everything
was
going
wrong
his
lawyer
said
he
reckoned
he
would
win
his
lawsuit
and
get
the
money
if
they
ever
got
started
on
the
trial
but
then
there
was
ways
to
put
it
off
a
long
time
and
judge
thatcher
knowed
how
to
do
it
and
he
said
people
allowed
there
be
another
trial
to
get
me
away
from
him
and
give
me
to
the
widow
for
my
guardian
and
they
guessed
it
would
win
this
time
this
shook
me
up
considerable
because
i
did
want
to
go
back
to
the
widow
any
more
and
be
so
cramped
up
and
sivilized
as
they
called
it
then
the
old
man
got
to
cussing
and
cussed
everything
and
everybody
he
could
think
of
and
then
cussed
them
all
over
again
to
make
sure
he
had
skipped
any
and
after
that
he
polished
off
with
a
kind
of
a
general
cuss
all
round
including
a
considerable
parcel
of
people
which
he
did
know
the
names
of
and
so
called
them
when
he
got
to
them
and
went
right
along
with
his
cussing
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
widow
get
me
he
said
he
would
watch
out
and
if
they
tried
to
come
any
such
game
on
him
he
knowed
of
a
place
six
or
seven
mile
off
to
stow
me
in
where
they
might
hunt
till
they
dropped
and
they
could
find
me
that
made
me
pretty
uneasy
again
but
only
for
a
minute
i
reckoned
i
would
stay
on
hand
till
he
got
that
chance
the
old
man
made
me
go
to
the
skiff
and
fetch
the
things
he
had
got
there
was
a
sack
of
corn
meal
and
a
side
of
bacon
ammunition
and
a
jug
of
whisky
and
an
old
book
and
two
newspapers
for
wadding
besides
some
tow
i
toted
up
a
load
and
went
back
and
set
down
on
the
bow
of
the
skiff
to
rest
i
thought
it
all
over
and
i
reckoned
i
would
walk
off
with
the
gun
and
some
lines
and
take
to
the
woods
when
i
run
away
i
guessed
i
would
stay
in
one
place
but
just
tramp
right
across
the
country
mostly
night
times
and
hunt
and
fish
to
keep
alive
and
so
get
so
far
away
that
the
old
man
nor
the
widow
could
ever
find
me
any
more
i
judged
i
would
saw
out
and
leave
that
night
if
pap
got
drunk
enough
and
i
reckoned
he
would
i
got
so
full
of
it
i
did
notice
how
long
i
was
staying
till
the
old
man
hollered
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
asleep
or
drownded
i
got
the
things
all
up
to
the
cabin
and
then
it
was
about
dark
while
i
was
cooking
supper
the
old
man
took
a
swig
or
two
and
got
sort
of
warmed
up
and
went
to
ripping
again
he
had
been
drunk
over
in
town
and
laid
in
the
gutter
all
night
and
he
was
a
sight
to
look
at
a
body
would
a
thought
he
was
adam
he
was
just
all
mud
whenever
his
liquor
begun
to
work
he
most
always
went
for
the
govment
this
time
he
says
call
this
a
govment
why
just
look
at
it
and
see
what
it
like
here
the
law
ready
to
take
a
man
son
away
from
him
a
man
own
son
which
he
has
had
all
the
trouble
and
all
the
anxiety
and
all
the
expense
of
raising
yes
just
as
that
man
has
got
that
son
raised
at
last
and
ready
to
go
to
work
and
begin
to
do
suthin
for
him
and
give
him
a
rest
the
law
up
and
goes
for
him
and
they
call
that
govment
that
ai
all
nuther
the
law
backs
that
old
judge
thatcher
up
and
helps
him
to
keep
me
out
o
my
property
here
what
the
law
does
the
law
takes
a
man
worth
six
thousand
dollars
and
and
jams
him
into
an
old
trap
of
a
cabin
like
this
and
lets
him
go
round
in
clothes
that
ai
fitten
for
a
hog
they
call
that
govment
a
man
get
his
rights
in
a
govment
like
this
sometimes
i
a
mighty
notion
to
just
leave
the
country
for
good
and
all
yes
and
i
told
so
i
told
old
thatcher
so
to
his
face
lots
of
heard
me
and
can
tell
what
i
said
says
i
for
two
cents
i
leave
the
blamed
country
and
never
come
it
agin
them
the
very
words
i
says
look
at
my
hat
if
you
call
it
a
hat
but
the
lid
raises
up
and
the
rest
of
it
goes
down
till
it
below
my
chin
and
then
it
ai
rightly
a
hat
at
all
but
more
like
my
head
was
shoved
up
through
a
jint
o
look
at
it
says
i
such
a
hat
for
me
to
wear
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
this
town
if
i
could
git
my
rights
oh
yes
this
is
a
wonderful
govment
wonderful
why
looky
here
there
was
a
free
nigger
there
from
ohio
a
mulatter
most
as
white
as
a
white
man
he
had
the
whitest
shirt
on
you
ever
see
too
and
the
shiniest
hat
and
there
ai
a
man
in
that
town
that
got
as
fine
clothes
as
what
he
had
and
he
had
a
gold
watch
and
chain
and
a
cane
the
awfulest
old
nabob
in
the
state
and
what
do
you
think
they
said
he
was
a
in
a
college
and
could
talk
all
kinds
of
languages
and
knowed
everything
and
that
ai
the
wust
they
said
he
could
vote
when
he
was
at
home
well
that
let
me
out
thinks
i
what
is
the
country
to
it
was
day
and
i
was
just
about
to
go
and
vote
myself
if
i
war
too
drunk
to
get
there
but
when
they
told
me
there
was
a
state
in
this
country
where
they
let
that
nigger
vote
i
drawed
out
i
says
i
never
vote
agin
them
the
very
words
i
said
they
all
heard
me
and
the
country
may
rot
for
all
me
i
never
vote
agin
as
long
as
i
live
and
to
see
the
cool
way
of
that
nigger
why
he
would
a
give
me
the
road
if
i
shoved
him
out
o
the
way
i
says
to
the
people
why
ai
this
nigger
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
that
what
i
want
to
know
and
what
do
you
reckon
they
said
why
they
said
he
could
be
sold
till
he
been
in
the
state
six
months
and
he
had
been
there
that
long
yet
there
now
that
a
specimen
they
call
that
a
govment
that
ca
sell
a
free
nigger
till
he
been
in
the
state
six
months
here
a
govment
that
calls
itself
a
govment
and
lets
on
to
be
a
govment
and
thinks
it
is
a
govment
and
yet
got
to
set
for
six
whole
months
before
it
can
take
a
hold
of
a
prowling
thieving
infernal
free
nigger
and
pap
was
agoing
on
so
he
never
noticed
where
his
old
limber
legs
was
taking
him
to
so
he
went
head
over
heels
over
the
tub
of
salt
pork
and
barked
both
shins
and
the
rest
of
his
speech
was
all
the
hottest
kind
of
language
mostly
hove
at
the
nigger
and
the
govment
though
he
give
the
tub
some
too
all
along
here
and
there
he
hopped
around
the
cabin
considerable
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
holding
first
one
shin
and
then
the
other
one
and
at
last
he
let
out
with
his
left
foot
all
of
a
sudden
and
fetched
the
tub
a
rattling
kick
but
it
war
good
judgment
because
that
was
the
boot
that
had
a
couple
of
his
toes
leaking
out
of
the
front
end
of
it
so
now
he
raised
a
howl
that
fairly
made
a
body
hair
raise
and
down
he
went
in
the
dirt
and
rolled
there
and
held
his
toes
and
the
cussing
he
done
then
laid
over
anything
he
had
ever
done
previous
he
said
so
his
own
self
afterwards
he
had
heard
old
sowberry
hagan
in
his
best
days
and
he
said
it
laid
over
him
too
but
i
reckon
that
was
sort
of
piling
it
on
maybe
after
supper
pap
took
the
jug
and
said
he
had
enough
whisky
there
for
two
drunks
and
one
delirium
tremens
that
was
always
his
word
i
judged
he
would
be
blind
drunk
in
about
an
hour
and
then
i
would
steal
the
key
or
saw
myself
out
one
or
he
drank
and
drank
and
tumbled
down
on
his
blankets
by
and
by
but
luck
did
run
my
way
he
did
go
sound
asleep
but
was
uneasy
he
groaned
and
moaned
and
thrashed
around
this
way
and
that
for
a
long
time
at
last
i
got
so
sleepy
i
keep
my
eyes
open
all
i
could
do
and
so
before
i
knowed
what
i
was
about
i
was
sound
asleep
and
the
candle
burning
i
do
know
how
long
i
was
asleep
but
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
awful
scream
and
i
was
up
there
was
pap
looking
wild
and
skipping
around
every
which
way
and
yelling
about
snakes
he
said
they
was
crawling
up
his
legs
and
then
he
would
give
a
jump
and
scream
and
say
one
had
bit
him
on
the
cheek
but
i
could
see
no
snakes
he
started
and
run
round
and
round
the
cabin
hollering
take
him
off
take
him
off
he
biting
me
on
the
neck
i
never
see
a
man
look
so
wild
in
the
eyes
pretty
soon
he
was
all
fagged
out
and
fell
down
panting
then
he
rolled
over
and
over
wonderful
fast
kicking
things
every
which
way
and
striking
and
grabbing
at
the
air
with
his
hands
and
screaming
and
saying
there
was
devils
of
him
he
wore
out
by
and
by
and
laid
still
a
while
moaning
then
he
laid
stiller
and
did
make
a
sound
i
could
hear
the
owls
and
the
wolves
away
off
in
the
woods
and
it
seemed
terrible
still
he
was
laying
over
by
the
corner
by
and
by
he
raised
up
part
way
and
listened
with
his
head
to
one
side
he
says
very
low
tramp
tramp
tramp
that
the
dead
tramp
tramp
tramp
coming
after
me
but
i
wo
go
oh
they
here
do
touch
me
do
hands
off
they
cold
let
go
oh
let
a
poor
devil
alone
then
he
went
down
on
all
fours
and
crawled
off
begging
them
to
let
him
alone
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
wallowed
in
under
the
old
pine
table
still
and
then
he
went
to
crying
i
could
hear
him
through
the
blanket
by
and
by
he
rolled
out
and
jumped
up
on
his
feet
looking
wild
and
he
see
me
and
went
for
me
he
chased
me
round
and
round
the
place
with
a
calling
me
the
angel
of
death
and
saying
he
would
kill
me
and
then
i
could
come
for
him
no
more
i
begged
and
told
him
i
was
only
huck
but
he
laughed
such
a
screechy
laugh
and
roared
and
cussed
and
kept
on
chasing
me
up
once
when
i
turned
short
and
dodged
under
his
arm
he
made
a
grab
and
got
me
by
the
jacket
between
my
shoulders
and
i
thought
i
was
gone
but
i
slid
out
of
the
jacket
quick
as
lightning
and
saved
myself
pretty
soon
he
was
all
tired
out
and
dropped
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
and
said
he
would
rest
a
minute
and
then
kill
me
he
put
his
knife
under
him
and
said
he
would
sleep
and
get
strong
and
then
he
would
see
who
was
who
so
he
dozed
off
pretty
soon
by
and
by
i
got
the
old
chair
and
clumb
up
as
easy
as
i
could
not
to
make
any
noise
and
got
down
the
gun
i
slipped
the
ramrod
down
it
to
make
sure
it
was
loaded
then
i
laid
it
across
the
turnip
barrel
pointing
towards
pap
and
set
down
behind
it
to
wait
for
him
to
stir
and
how
slow
and
still
the
time
did
drag
along
chapter
vii
git
up
what
you
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
around
trying
to
make
out
where
i
was
it
was
after
and
i
had
been
sound
asleep
pap
was
standing
over
me
looking
sour
and
sick
too
he
says
what
you
doin
with
this
gun
i
judged
he
did
know
nothing
about
what
he
had
been
doing
so
i
says
somebody
tried
to
get
in
so
i
was
laying
for
him
why
did
you
roust
me
out
well
i
tried
to
but
i
could
i
could
budge
you
well
all
right
do
stand
there
palavering
all
day
but
out
with
you
and
see
if
there
a
fish
on
the
lines
for
breakfast
i
be
along
in
a
minute
he
unlocked
the
door
and
i
cleared
out
up
the
i
noticed
some
pieces
of
limbs
and
such
things
floating
down
and
a
sprinkling
of
bark
so
i
knowed
the
river
had
begun
to
rise
i
reckoned
i
would
have
great
times
now
if
i
was
over
at
the
town
the
june
rise
used
to
be
always
luck
for
me
because
as
soon
as
that
rise
begins
here
comes
cordwood
floating
down
and
pieces
of
log
rafts
sometimes
a
dozen
logs
together
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
catch
them
and
sell
them
to
the
and
the
sawmill
i
went
along
up
the
bank
with
one
eye
out
for
pap
and
one
out
for
what
the
rise
might
fetch
along
well
all
at
once
here
comes
a
canoe
just
a
beauty
too
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
foot
long
riding
high
like
a
duck
i
shot
off
of
the
bank
like
a
frog
clothes
and
all
on
and
struck
out
for
the
canoe
i
just
expected
there
be
somebody
laying
down
in
it
because
people
often
done
that
to
fool
folks
and
when
a
chap
had
pulled
a
skiff
out
most
to
it
they
raise
up
and
laugh
at
him
but
it
war
so
this
time
it
was
a
sure
enough
and
i
clumb
in
and
paddled
her
ashore
thinks
i
the
old
man
will
be
glad
when
he
sees
this
she
worth
ten
dollars
but
when
i
got
to
shore
pap
was
in
sight
yet
and
as
i
was
running
her
into
a
little
creek
like
a
gully
all
hung
over
with
vines
and
willows
i
struck
another
idea
i
judged
i
hide
her
good
and
then
of
taking
to
the
woods
when
i
run
off
i
go
down
the
river
about
fifty
mile
and
camp
in
one
place
for
good
and
not
have
such
a
rough
time
tramping
on
foot
it
was
pretty
close
to
the
shanty
and
i
thought
i
heard
the
old
man
coming
all
the
time
but
i
got
her
hid
and
then
i
out
and
looked
around
a
bunch
of
willows
and
there
was
the
old
man
down
the
path
a
piece
just
drawing
a
bead
on
a
bird
with
his
gun
so
he
had
seen
anything
when
he
got
along
i
was
hard
at
it
taking
up
a
trot
line
he
abused
me
a
little
for
being
so
slow
but
i
told
him
i
fell
in
the
river
and
that
was
what
made
me
so
long
i
knowed
he
would
see
i
was
wet
and
then
he
would
be
asking
questions
we
got
five
catfish
off
the
lines
and
went
home
while
we
laid
off
after
breakfast
to
sleep
up
both
of
us
being
about
wore
out
i
got
to
thinking
that
if
i
could
fix
up
some
way
to
keep
pap
and
the
widow
from
trying
to
follow
me
it
would
be
a
certainer
thing
than
trusting
to
luck
to
get
far
enough
off
before
they
missed
me
you
see
all
kinds
of
things
might
happen
well
i
did
see
no
way
for
a
while
but
by
and
by
pap
raised
up
a
minute
to
drink
another
barrel
of
water
and
he
says
another
time
a
man
comes
round
here
you
roust
me
out
you
hear
that
man
war
here
for
no
good
i
a
shot
him
next
time
you
roust
me
out
you
hear
then
he
dropped
down
and
went
to
sleep
again
but
what
he
had
been
saying
give
me
the
very
idea
i
wanted
i
says
to
myself
i
can
fix
it
now
so
nobody
wo
think
of
following
me
about
twelve
we
turned
out
and
went
along
up
the
bank
the
river
was
coming
up
pretty
fast
and
lots
of
driftwood
going
by
on
the
rise
by
and
by
along
comes
part
of
a
log
raft
nine
logs
fast
together
we
went
out
with
the
skiff
and
towed
it
ashore
then
we
had
dinner
anybody
but
pap
would
a
waited
and
seen
the
day
through
so
as
to
catch
more
stuff
but
that
war
pap
style
nine
logs
was
enough
for
one
time
he
must
shove
right
over
to
town
and
sell
so
he
locked
me
in
and
took
the
skiff
and
started
off
towing
the
raft
about
three
i
judged
he
would
come
back
that
night
i
waited
till
i
reckoned
he
had
got
a
good
start
then
i
out
with
my
saw
and
went
to
work
on
that
log
again
before
he
was
side
of
the
river
i
was
out
of
the
hole
him
and
his
raft
was
just
a
speck
on
the
water
away
off
yonder
i
took
the
sack
of
corn
meal
and
took
it
to
where
the
canoe
was
hid
and
shoved
the
vines
and
branches
apart
and
put
it
in
then
i
done
the
same
with
the
side
of
bacon
then
the
i
took
all
the
coffee
and
sugar
there
was
and
all
the
ammunition
i
took
the
wadding
i
took
the
bucket
and
gourd
i
took
a
dipper
and
a
tin
cup
and
my
old
saw
and
two
blankets
and
the
skillet
and
the
i
took
and
matches
and
other
things
everything
that
was
worth
a
cent
i
cleaned
out
the
place
i
wanted
an
axe
but
there
was
any
only
the
one
out
at
the
woodpile
and
i
knowed
why
i
was
going
to
leave
that
i
fetched
out
the
gun
and
now
i
was
done
i
had
wore
the
ground
a
good
deal
crawling
out
of
the
hole
and
dragging
out
so
many
things
so
i
fixed
that
as
good
as
i
could
from
the
outside
by
scattering
dust
on
the
place
which
covered
up
the
smoothness
and
the
sawdust
then
i
fixed
the
piece
of
log
back
into
its
place
and
put
two
rocks
under
it
and
one
against
it
to
hold
it
there
for
it
was
bent
up
at
that
place
and
did
quite
touch
ground
if
you
stood
four
or
five
foot
away
and
did
know
it
was
sawed
you
would
never
notice
it
and
besides
this
was
the
back
of
the
cabin
and
it
war
likely
anybody
would
go
fooling
around
there
it
was
all
grass
clear
to
the
canoe
so
i
had
left
a
track
i
followed
around
to
see
i
stood
on
the
bank
and
looked
out
over
the
river
all
safe
so
i
took
the
gun
and
went
up
a
piece
into
the
woods
and
was
hunting
around
for
some
birds
when
i
see
a
wild
pig
hogs
soon
went
wild
in
them
bottoms
after
they
had
got
away
from
the
prairie
farms
i
shot
this
fellow
and
took
him
into
camp
i
took
the
axe
and
smashed
in
the
door
i
beat
it
and
hacked
it
considerable
it
i
fetched
the
pig
in
and
took
him
back
nearly
to
the
table
and
hacked
into
his
throat
with
the
axe
and
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
to
bleed
i
say
ground
because
it
was
ground
hard
packed
and
no
boards
well
next
i
took
an
old
sack
and
put
a
lot
of
big
rocks
in
it
all
i
could
drag
and
i
started
it
from
the
pig
and
dragged
it
to
the
door
and
through
the
woods
down
to
the
river
and
dumped
it
in
and
down
it
sunk
out
of
sight
you
could
easy
see
that
something
had
been
dragged
over
the
ground
i
did
wish
tom
sawyer
was
there
i
knowed
he
would
take
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
business
and
throw
in
the
fancy
touches
nobody
could
spread
himself
like
tom
sawyer
in
such
a
thing
as
that
well
last
i
pulled
out
some
of
my
hair
and
blooded
the
axe
good
and
stuck
it
on
the
back
side
and
slung
the
axe
in
the
corner
then
i
took
up
the
pig
and
held
him
to
my
breast
with
my
jacket
so
he
could
drip
till
i
got
a
good
piece
below
the
house
and
then
dumped
him
into
the
river
now
i
thought
of
something
else
so
i
went
and
got
the
bag
of
meal
and
my
old
saw
out
of
the
canoe
and
fetched
them
to
the
house
i
took
the
bag
to
where
it
used
to
stand
and
ripped
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
saw
for
there
war
no
knives
and
forks
on
the
place
pap
done
everything
with
his
about
the
cooking
then
i
carried
the
sack
about
a
hundred
yards
across
the
grass
and
through
the
willows
east
of
the
house
to
a
shallow
lake
that
was
five
mile
wide
and
full
of
rushes
and
ducks
too
you
might
say
in
the
season
there
was
a
slough
or
a
creek
leading
out
of
it
on
the
other
side
that
went
miles
away
i
do
know
where
but
it
did
go
to
the
river
the
meal
sifted
out
and
made
a
little
track
all
the
way
to
the
lake
i
dropped
whetstone
there
too
so
as
to
look
like
it
had
been
done
by
accident
then
i
tied
up
the
rip
in
the
meal
sack
with
a
string
so
it
leak
no
more
and
took
it
and
my
saw
to
the
canoe
again
it
was
about
dark
now
so
i
dropped
the
canoe
down
the
river
under
some
willows
that
hung
over
the
bank
and
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise
i
made
fast
to
a
willow
then
i
took
a
bite
to
eat
and
by
and
by
laid
down
in
the
canoe
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
lay
out
a
plan
i
says
to
myself
follow
the
track
of
that
sackful
of
rocks
to
the
shore
and
then
drag
the
river
for
me
and
they
follow
that
meal
track
to
the
lake
and
go
browsing
down
the
creek
that
leads
out
of
it
to
find
the
robbers
that
killed
me
and
took
the
things
they
wo
ever
hunt
the
river
for
anything
but
my
dead
carcass
they
soon
get
tired
of
that
and
bother
no
more
about
me
all
right
i
can
stop
anywhere
i
want
to
jackson
island
is
good
enough
for
me
i
know
that
island
pretty
well
and
nobody
ever
comes
there
and
then
i
can
paddle
over
to
town
nights
and
slink
around
and
pick
up
things
i
want
jackson
island
the
place
i
was
pretty
tired
and
the
first
thing
i
knowed
i
was
asleep
when
i
woke
up
i
did
know
where
i
was
for
a
minute
i
set
up
and
looked
around
a
little
scared
then
i
remembered
the
river
looked
miles
and
miles
across
the
moon
was
so
bright
i
could
a
counted
the
drift
logs
that
went
along
black
and
still
hundreds
of
yards
out
from
shore
everything
was
dead
quiet
and
it
looked
late
and
smelt
late
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
know
the
words
to
put
it
in
i
took
a
good
gap
and
a
stretch
and
was
just
going
to
unhitch
and
start
when
i
heard
a
sound
away
over
the
water
i
listened
pretty
soon
i
made
it
out
it
was
that
dull
kind
of
a
regular
sound
that
comes
from
oars
working
in
rowlocks
when
it
a
still
night
i
peeped
out
through
the
willow
branches
and
there
it
was
a
skiff
away
across
the
water
i
could
tell
how
many
was
in
it
it
kept
and
when
it
was
abreast
of
me
i
see
there
war
but
one
man
in
it
think
i
maybe
it
pap
though
i
war
expecting
him
he
dropped
below
me
with
the
current
and
by
and
by
he
came
up
shore
in
the
easy
water
and
he
went
by
so
close
i
could
a
reached
out
the
gun
and
touched
him
well
it
was
pap
sure
enough
and
sober
too
by
the
way
he
laid
his
oars
i
did
lose
no
time
the
next
minute
i
was
down
stream
soft
but
quick
in
the
shade
of
the
bank
i
made
two
mile
and
a
half
and
then
struck
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
because
pretty
soon
i
would
be
passing
the
ferry
landing
and
people
might
see
me
and
hail
me
i
got
out
amongst
the
driftwood
and
then
laid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
her
float
i
laid
there
and
had
a
good
rest
and
a
smoke
out
of
my
pipe
looking
away
into
the
sky
not
a
cloud
in
it
the
sky
looks
ever
so
deep
when
you
lay
down
on
your
back
in
the
moonshine
i
never
knowed
it
before
and
how
far
a
body
can
hear
on
the
water
such
nights
i
heard
people
talking
at
the
ferry
landing
i
heard
what
they
said
too
every
word
of
it
one
man
said
it
was
getting
towards
the
long
days
and
the
short
nights
now
one
said
this
war
one
of
the
short
ones
he
reckoned
and
then
they
laughed
and
he
said
it
over
again
and
they
laughed
again
then
they
waked
up
another
fellow
and
told
him
and
laughed
but
he
did
laugh
he
ripped
out
something
brisk
and
said
let
him
alone
the
first
fellow
said
he
to
tell
it
to
his
old
woman
she
would
think
it
was
pretty
good
but
he
said
that
war
nothing
to
some
things
he
had
said
in
his
time
i
heard
one
man
say
it
was
nearly
three
and
he
hoped
daylight
would
wait
more
than
about
a
week
longer
after
that
the
talk
got
further
and
further
away
and
i
could
make
out
the
words
any
more
but
i
could
hear
the
mumble
and
now
and
then
a
laugh
too
but
it
seemed
a
long
ways
off
i
was
away
below
the
ferry
now
i
rose
up
and
there
was
island
about
two
mile
and
a
half
down
stream
heavy
timbered
and
standing
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
river
big
and
dark
and
solid
like
a
steamboat
without
any
lights
there
war
any
signs
of
the
bar
at
the
head
it
was
all
under
water
now
it
did
take
me
long
to
get
there
i
shot
past
the
head
at
a
ripping
rate
the
current
was
so
swift
and
then
i
got
into
the
dead
water
and
landed
on
the
side
towards
the
illinois
shore
i
run
the
canoe
into
a
deep
dent
in
the
bank
that
i
knowed
about
i
had
to
part
the
willow
branches
to
get
in
and
when
i
made
fast
nobody
could
a
seen
the
canoe
from
the
outside
i
went
up
and
set
down
on
a
log
at
the
head
of
the
island
and
looked
out
on
the
big
river
and
the
black
driftwood
and
away
over
to
the
town
three
mile
away
where
there
was
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
a
monstrous
big
was
about
a
mile
up
stream
coming
along
down
with
a
lantern
in
the
middle
of
it
i
watched
it
come
creeping
down
and
when
it
was
most
abreast
of
where
i
stood
i
heard
a
man
say
stern
oars
there
heave
her
head
to
stabboard
i
heard
that
just
as
plain
as
if
the
man
was
by
my
side
there
was
a
little
gray
in
the
sky
now
so
i
stepped
into
the
woods
and
laid
down
for
a
nap
before
breakfast
chapter
viii
the
sun
was
up
so
high
when
i
waked
that
i
judged
it
was
after
eight
i
laid
there
in
the
grass
and
the
cool
shade
thinking
about
things
and
feeling
rested
and
ruther
comfortable
and
satisfied
i
could
see
the
sun
out
at
one
or
two
holes
but
mostly
it
was
big
trees
all
about
and
gloomy
in
there
amongst
them
there
was
freckled
places
on
the
ground
where
the
light
sifted
down
through
the
leaves
and
the
freckled
places
swapped
about
a
little
showing
there
was
a
little
breeze
up
there
a
couple
of
squirrels
set
on
a
limb
and
jabbered
at
me
very
friendly
i
was
powerful
lazy
and
comfortable
did
want
to
get
up
and
cook
breakfast
well
i
was
dozing
off
again
when
i
thinks
i
hears
a
deep
sound
of
boom
away
up
the
river
i
rouses
up
and
rests
on
my
elbow
and
listens
pretty
soon
i
hears
it
again
i
hopped
up
and
went
and
looked
out
at
a
hole
in
the
leaves
and
i
see
a
bunch
of
smoke
laying
on
the
water
a
long
ways
up
about
abreast
the
ferry
and
there
was
the
ferryboat
full
of
people
floating
along
down
i
knowed
what
was
the
matter
now
boom
i
see
the
white
smoke
squirt
out
of
the
side
you
see
they
was
firing
cannon
over
the
water
trying
to
make
my
carcass
come
to
the
top
i
was
pretty
hungry
but
it
war
going
to
do
for
me
to
start
a
fire
because
they
might
see
the
smoke
so
i
set
there
and
watched
the
and
listened
to
the
boom
the
river
was
a
mile
wide
there
and
it
always
looks
pretty
on
a
summer
morning
so
i
was
having
a
good
enough
time
seeing
them
hunt
for
my
remainders
if
i
only
had
a
bite
to
eat
well
then
i
happened
to
think
how
they
always
put
quicksilver
in
loaves
of
bread
and
float
them
off
because
they
always
go
right
to
the
drownded
carcass
and
stop
there
so
says
i
i
keep
a
lookout
and
if
any
of
them
floating
around
after
me
i
give
them
a
show
i
changed
to
the
illinois
edge
of
the
island
to
see
what
luck
i
could
have
and
i
war
disappointed
a
big
double
loaf
come
along
and
i
most
got
it
with
a
long
stick
but
my
foot
slipped
and
she
floated
out
further
of
course
i
was
where
the
current
set
in
the
closest
to
the
shore
i
knowed
enough
for
that
but
by
and
by
along
comes
another
one
and
this
time
i
won
i
took
out
the
plug
and
shook
out
the
little
dab
of
quicksilver
and
set
my
teeth
in
it
was
baker
bread
what
the
quality
eat
none
of
your
i
got
a
good
place
amongst
the
leaves
and
set
there
on
a
log
munching
the
bread
and
watching
the
and
very
well
satisfied
and
then
something
struck
me
i
says
now
i
reckon
the
widow
or
the
parson
or
somebody
prayed
that
this
bread
would
find
me
and
here
it
has
gone
and
done
it
so
there
ai
no
doubt
but
there
is
something
in
that
thing
that
is
there
something
in
it
when
a
body
like
the
widow
or
the
parson
prays
but
it
do
work
for
me
and
i
reckon
it
do
work
for
only
just
the
right
kind
i
lit
a
pipe
and
had
a
good
long
smoke
and
went
on
watching
the
ferryboat
was
floating
with
the
current
and
i
allowed
i
have
a
chance
to
see
who
was
aboard
when
she
come
along
because
she
would
come
in
close
where
the
bread
did
when
she
got
pretty
well
along
down
towards
me
i
put
out
my
pipe
and
went
to
where
i
fished
out
the
bread
and
laid
down
behind
a
log
on
the
bank
in
a
little
open
place
where
the
log
forked
i
could
peep
through
by
and
by
she
come
along
and
she
drifted
in
so
close
that
they
could
a
run
out
a
plank
and
walked
ashore
most
everybody
was
on
the
boat
pap
and
judge
thatcher
and
bessie
thatcher
and
jo
harper
and
tom
sawyer
and
his
old
aunt
polly
and
sid
and
mary
and
plenty
more
everybody
was
talking
about
the
murder
but
the
captain
broke
in
and
says
look
sharp
now
the
current
sets
in
the
closest
here
and
maybe
washed
ashore
and
got
tangled
amongst
the
brush
at
the
water
edge
i
hope
so
anyway
i
did
hope
so
they
all
crowded
up
and
leaned
over
the
rails
nearly
in
my
face
and
kept
still
watching
with
all
their
might
i
could
see
them
but
they
could
see
me
then
the
captain
sung
out
stand
away
and
the
cannon
let
off
such
a
blast
right
before
me
that
it
made
me
deef
with
the
noise
and
pretty
near
blind
with
the
smoke
and
i
judged
i
was
gone
if
they
a
had
some
bullets
in
i
reckon
they
a
got
the
corpse
they
was
after
well
i
see
i
war
hurt
thanks
to
goodness
the
boat
floated
on
and
went
out
of
sight
around
the
shoulder
of
the
island
i
could
hear
the
booming
now
and
then
further
and
further
off
and
by
and
by
after
an
hour
i
did
hear
it
no
more
the
island
was
three
mile
long
i
judged
they
had
got
to
the
foot
and
was
giving
it
up
but
they
did
yet
a
while
they
turned
around
the
foot
of
the
island
and
started
up
the
channel
on
the
missouri
side
under
steam
and
booming
once
in
a
while
as
they
went
i
crossed
over
to
that
side
and
watched
them
when
they
got
abreast
the
head
of
the
island
they
quit
shooting
and
dropped
over
to
the
missouri
shore
and
went
home
to
the
town
i
knowed
i
was
all
right
now
nobody
else
would
come
after
me
i
got
my
traps
out
of
the
canoe
and
made
me
a
nice
camp
in
the
thick
woods
i
made
a
kind
of
a
tent
out
of
my
blankets
to
put
my
things
under
so
the
rain
could
get
at
them
i
catched
a
catfish
and
haggled
him
open
with
my
saw
and
towards
sundown
i
started
my
camp
fire
and
had
supper
then
i
set
out
a
line
to
catch
some
fish
for
breakfast
when
it
was
dark
i
set
by
my
camp
fire
smoking
and
feeling
pretty
well
satisfied
but
by
and
by
it
got
sort
of
lonesome
and
so
i
went
and
set
on
the
bank
and
listened
to
the
current
swashing
along
and
counted
the
stars
and
drift
logs
and
rafts
that
come
down
and
then
went
to
bed
there
ai
no
better
way
to
put
in
time
when
you
are
lonesome
you
stay
so
you
soon
get
over
it
and
so
for
three
days
and
nights
no
difference
just
the
same
thing
but
the
next
day
i
went
exploring
around
down
through
the
island
i
was
boss
of
it
it
all
belonged
to
me
so
to
say
and
i
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
but
mainly
i
wanted
to
put
in
the
time
i
found
plenty
strawberries
ripe
and
prime
and
green
summer
grapes
and
green
razberries
and
the
green
blackberries
was
just
beginning
to
show
they
would
all
come
handy
by
and
by
i
judged
well
i
went
fooling
along
in
the
deep
woods
till
i
judged
i
war
far
from
the
foot
of
the
island
i
had
my
gun
along
but
i
had
shot
nothing
it
was
for
protection
thought
i
would
kill
some
game
nigh
home
about
this
time
i
mighty
near
stepped
on
a
snake
and
it
went
sliding
off
through
the
grass
and
flowers
and
i
after
it
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
it
i
clipped
along
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
bounded
right
on
to
the
ashes
of
a
camp
fire
that
was
still
smoking
my
heart
jumped
up
amongst
my
lungs
i
never
waited
for
to
look
further
but
uncocked
my
gun
and
went
sneaking
back
on
my
tiptoes
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
every
now
and
then
i
stopped
a
second
amongst
the
thick
leaves
and
listened
but
my
breath
come
so
hard
i
could
hear
nothing
else
i
slunk
along
another
piece
further
then
listened
again
and
so
on
and
so
on
if
i
see
a
stump
i
took
it
for
a
man
if
i
trod
on
a
stick
and
broke
it
it
made
me
feel
like
a
person
had
cut
one
of
my
breaths
in
two
and
i
only
got
half
and
the
short
half
too
when
i
got
to
camp
i
war
feeling
very
brash
there
war
much
sand
in
my
craw
but
i
says
this
ai
no
time
to
be
fooling
around
so
i
got
all
my
traps
into
my
canoe
again
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
sight
and
i
put
out
the
fire
and
scattered
the
ashes
around
to
look
like
an
old
last
year
camp
and
then
clumb
a
tree
i
reckon
i
was
up
in
the
tree
two
hours
but
i
did
see
nothing
i
did
hear
nothing
i
only
thought
i
heard
and
seen
as
much
as
a
thousand
things
well
i
could
stay
up
there
forever
so
at
last
i
got
down
but
i
kept
in
the
thick
woods
and
on
the
lookout
all
the
time
all
i
could
get
to
eat
was
berries
and
what
was
left
over
from
breakfast
by
the
time
it
was
night
i
was
pretty
hungry
so
when
it
was
good
and
dark
i
slid
out
from
shore
before
moonrise
and
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
bank
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
went
out
in
the
woods
and
cooked
a
supper
and
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
i
would
stay
there
all
night
when
i
hear
a
and
says
to
myself
horses
coming
and
next
i
hear
people
voices
i
got
everything
into
the
canoe
as
quick
as
i
could
and
then
went
creeping
through
the
woods
to
see
what
i
could
find
out
i
had
got
far
when
i
hear
a
man
say
we
better
camp
here
if
we
can
find
a
good
place
the
horses
is
about
beat
out
let
look
around
i
did
wait
but
shoved
out
and
paddled
away
easy
i
tied
up
in
the
old
place
and
reckoned
i
would
sleep
in
the
canoe
i
did
sleep
much
i
could
somehow
for
thinking
and
every
time
i
waked
up
i
thought
somebody
had
me
by
the
neck
so
the
sleep
did
do
me
no
good
by
and
by
i
says
to
myself
i
ca
live
this
way
to
find
out
who
it
is
that
here
on
the
island
with
me
find
it
out
or
bust
well
i
felt
better
right
off
so
i
took
my
paddle
and
slid
out
from
shore
just
a
step
or
two
and
then
let
the
canoe
drop
along
down
amongst
the
shadows
the
moon
was
shining
and
outside
of
the
shadows
it
made
it
most
as
light
as
day
i
poked
along
well
on
to
an
hour
everything
still
as
rocks
and
sound
asleep
well
by
this
time
i
was
most
down
to
the
foot
of
the
island
a
little
ripply
cool
breeze
begun
to
blow
and
that
was
as
good
as
saying
the
night
was
about
done
i
give
her
a
turn
with
the
paddle
and
brung
her
nose
to
shore
then
i
got
my
gun
and
slipped
out
and
into
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
sat
down
there
on
a
log
and
looked
out
through
the
leaves
i
see
the
moon
go
off
watch
and
the
darkness
begin
to
blanket
the
river
but
in
a
little
while
i
see
a
pale
streak
over
the
treetops
and
knowed
the
day
was
coming
so
i
took
my
gun
and
slipped
off
towards
where
i
had
run
across
that
camp
fire
stopping
every
minute
or
two
to
listen
but
i
had
no
luck
somehow
i
could
seem
to
find
the
place
but
by
and
by
sure
enough
i
catched
a
glimpse
of
fire
away
through
the
trees
i
went
for
it
cautious
and
slow
by
and
by
i
was
close
enough
to
have
a
look
and
there
laid
a
man
on
the
ground
it
most
give
me
the
fantods
he
had
a
blanket
around
his
head
and
his
head
was
nearly
in
the
fire
i
set
there
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
in
about
six
foot
of
him
and
kept
my
eyes
on
him
steady
it
was
getting
gray
daylight
now
pretty
soon
he
gapped
and
stretched
himself
and
hove
off
the
blanket
and
it
was
miss
watson
jim
i
bet
i
was
glad
to
see
him
i
says
hello

and
skipped
out
he
bounced
up
and
stared
at
me
wild
then
he
drops
down
on
his
knees
and
puts
his
hands
together
and
says

a
sign
it
was
going

rain
he
said
it
was
a
sign
when

way
when

done
it
i

he
did
and
jim
said
you

count
the

cook
for
dinner
because
that
would
bring
bad
luck
the
same
if

he
said
if
a
man
owned
a
beehive
and
that
man
died
the
bees
must
be
told
about
it
before
next
morning
or
else
the
bees

all
weaken
down

die
jim

en
i
wuth
eight
hund
dollars
i
wisht
i
had
de
money
i
wouldn
want
no
mo
chapter
ix
i
wanted
to
go
and
look
at
a
place
right
about
the
middle
of
the
island
that
i
found
when
i
was
exploring
so
we
started
and
soon
got
to
it
because
the
island
was
only
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
this
place
was
a
tolerable
long
steep
hill
or
ridge
about
forty
foot
high
we
had
a
rough
time
getting
to
the
top
the
sides
was
so
steep
and
the
bushes
so
thick
we
tramped
and
clumb
around
all
over
it
and
by
and
by
found
a
good
big
cavern
in
the
rock
most
up
to
the
top
on
the
side
towards
illinois
the
cavern
was
as
big
as
two
or
three
rooms
bunched
together
and
jim
could
stand
up
straight
in
it
it
was
cool
in
there
jim
was
for
putting
our
traps
in
there
right
away
but
i
said
we
want
to
be
climbing
up
and
down
there
all
the
time
jim
said
if
we
had
the
canoe
hid
in
a
good
place
and
had
all
the
traps
in
the
cavern
we
could
rush
there
if
anybody
was
to
come
to
the
island
and
they
would
never
find
us
without
dogs
and
besides
he
said
them
little
birds
had
said
it
was
going
to
rain
and
did
i
want
the
things
to
get
wet
so
we
went
back
and
got
the
canoe
and
paddled
up
abreast
the
cavern
and
lugged
all
the
traps
up
there
then
we
hunted
up
a
place
close
by
to
hide
the
canoe
in
amongst
the
thick
willows
we
took
some
fish
off
of
the
lines
and
set
them
again
and
begun
to
get
ready
for
dinner
the
door
of
the
cavern
was
big
enough
to
roll
a
hogshead
in
and
on
one
side
of
the
door
the
floor
stuck
out
a
little
bit
and
was
flat
and
a
good
place
to
build
a
fire
on
so
we
built
it
there
and
cooked
dinner
we
spread
the
blankets
inside
for
a
carpet
and
eat
our
dinner
in
there
we
put
all
the
other
things
handy
at
the
back
of
the
cavern
pretty
soon
it
darkened
up
and
begun
to
thunder
and
lighten
so
the
birds
was
right
about
it
directly
it
begun
to
rain
and
it
rained
like
all
fury
too
and
i
never
see
the
wind
blow
so
it
was
one
of
these
regular
summer
storms
it
would
get
so
dark
that
it
looked
all
outside
and
lovely
and
the
rain
would
thrash
along
by
so
thick
that
the
trees
off
a
little
ways
looked
dim
and
and
here
would
come
a
blast
of
wind
that
would
bend
the
trees
down
and
turn
up
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
and
then
a
perfect
ripper
of
a
gust
would
follow
along
and
set
the
branches
to
tossing
their
arms
as
if
they
was
just
wild
and
next
when
it
was
just
about
the
bluest
and
blackest
fst
it
was
as
bright
as
glory
and
you
have
a
little
glimpse
of
about
away
off
yonder
in
the
storm
hundreds
of
yards
further
than
you
could
see
before
dark
as
sin
again
in
a
second
and
now
you
hear
the
thunder
let
go
with
an
awful
crash
and
then
go
rumbling
grumbling
tumbling
down
the
sky
towards
the
under
side
of
the
world
like
rolling
empty
barrels
down
stairs
where
it
long
stairs
and
they
bounce
a
good
deal
you
know
jim
this
is
nice
i
says
i
would
want
to
be
nowhere

chile
the
river
went
on
raising
and
raising
for
ten
or
twelve
days
till
at
last
it
was
over
the
banks
the
water
was
three
or
four
foot
deep
on
the
island
in
the
low
places
and
on
the
illinois
bottom
on
that
side
it
was
a
good
many
miles
wide
but
on
the
missouri
side
it
was
the
same
old
distance
across
a
half
a
mile
because
the
missouri
shore
was
just
a
wall
of
high
bluffs
daytimes
we
paddled
all
over
the
island
in
the
canoe
it
was
mighty
cool
and
shady
in
the
deep
woods
even
if
the
sun
was
blazing
outside
we
went
winding
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees
and
sometimes
the
vines
hung
so
thick
we
had
to
back
away
and
go
some
other
way
well
on
every
old
tree
you
could
see
rabbits
and
snakes
and
such
things
and
when
the
island
had
been
overflowed
a
day
or
two
they
got
so
tame
on
account
of
being
hungry
that
you
could
paddle
right
up
and
put
your
hand
on
them
if
you
wanted
to
but
not
the
snakes
and
turtles
they
would
slide
off
in
the
water
the
ridge
our
cavern
was
in
was
full
of
them
we
could
a
had
pets
enough
if
we
wanted
them
one
night
we
catched
a
little
section
of
a
lumber
raft
nice
pine
planks
it
was
twelve
foot
wide
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
long
and
the
top
stood
above
water
six
or
seven
inches
a
solid
level
floor
we
could
see
go
by
in
the
daylight
sometimes
but
we
let
them
go
we
did
show
ourselves
in
daylight
another
night
when
we
was
up
at
the
head
of
the
island
just
before
daylight
here
comes
a
down
on
the
west
side
she
was
a
and
tilted
over
considerable
we
paddled
out
and
got
aboard
clumb
in
at
an
upstairs
window
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
yet
so
we
made
the
canoe
fast
and
set
in
her
to
wait
for
daylight
the
light
begun
to
come
before
we
got
to
the
foot
of
the
island
then
we
looked
in
at
the
window
we
could
make
out
a
bed
and
a
table
and
two
old
chairs
and
lots
of
things
around
about
on
the
floor
and
there
was
clothes
hanging
against
the
wall
there
was
something
laying
on
the
floor
in
the
far
corner
that
looked
like
a
man
so
jim
says
hello
you
but
it
did
budge
so
i
hollered
again
and
then
jim
says
de
man
ai
asleep
he
dead
you
hold
still
i
go
en
see
he
went
and
bent
down
and
looked
and
says
it
a
dead
man
yes
indeedy
naked
too
he
ben
shot
in
de
back
i
he
ben
dead
two
er
three
days
come
in
huck
but
doan
look
at
his
face
it
too
gashly
i
did
look
at
him
at
all
jim
throwed
some
old
rags
over
him
but
he
need
done
it
i
did
want
to
see
him
there
was
heaps
of
old
greasy
cards
scattered
around
over
the
floor
and
old
whisky
bottles
and
a
couple
of
masks
made
out
of
black
cloth
and
all
over
the
walls
was
the
ignorantest
kind
of
words
and
pictures
made
with
charcoal
there
was
two
old
dirty
calico
dresses
and
a
and
some
women
underclothes
hanging
against
the
wall
and
some
men
clothing
too
we
put
the
lot
into
the
canoe
it
might
come
good
there
was
a
boy
old
speckled
straw
hat
on
the
floor
i
took
that
too
and
there
was
a
bottle
that
had
had
milk
in
it
and
it
had
a
rag
stopper
for
a
baby
to
suck
we
would
a
took
the
bottle
but
it
was
broke
there
was
a
seedy
old
chest
and
an
old
hair
trunk
with
the
hinges
broke
they
stood
open
but
there
nothing
left
in
them
that
was
any
account
the
way
things
was
scattered
about
we
reckoned
the
people
left
in
a
hurry
and
war
fixed
so
as
to
carry
off
most
of
their
stuff
we
got
an
old
tin
lantern
and
a
without
any
handle
and
a
barlow
knife
worth
two
bits
in
any
store
and
a
lot
of
tallow
candles
and
a
tin
candlestick
and
a
gourd
and
a
tin
cup
and
a
ratty
old
bedquilt
off
the
bed
and
a
reticule
with
needles
and
pins
and
beeswax
and
buttons
and
thread
and
all
such
truck
in
it
and
a
hatchet
and
some
nails
and
a
fishline
as
thick
as
my
little
finger
with
some
monstrous
hooks
on
it
and
a
roll
of
buckskin
and
a
leather
and
a
horseshoe
and
some
vials
of
medicine
that
did
have
no
label
on
them
and
just
as
we
was
leaving
i
found
a
tolerable
good
and
jim
he
found
a
ratty
old
and
a
wooden
leg
the
straps
was
broke
off
of
it
but
barring
that
it
was
a
good
enough
leg
though
it
was
too
long
for
me
and
not
long
enough
for
jim
and
we
could
find
the
other
one
though
we
hunted
all
around
and
so
take
it
all
around
we
made
a
good
haul
when
we
was
ready
to
shove
off
we
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
island
and
it
was
pretty
broad
day
so
i
made
jim
lay
down
in
the
canoe
and
cover
up
with
the
quilt
because
if
he
set
up
people
could
tell
he
was
a
nigger
a
good
ways
off
i
paddled
over
to
the
illinois
shore
and
drifted
down
most
a
half
a
mile
doing
it
i
crept
up
the
dead
water
under
the
bank
and
had
no
accidents
and
did
see
nobody
we
got
home
all
safe
chapter
x
after
breakfast
i
wanted
to
talk
about
the
dead
man
and
guess
out
how
he
come
to
be
killed
but
jim
did
want
to
he
said
it
would
fetch
bad
luck
and
besides
he
said
he
might
come
and
us
he
said
a
man
that
war
buried
was
more
likely
to
go
around
than
one
that
was
planted
and
comfortable
that
sounded
pretty
reasonable
so
i
say
no
more
but
i
could
keep
from
studying
over
it
and
wishing
i
knowed
who
shot
the
man
and
what
they
done
it
for
we
rummaged
the
clothes
we
got
and
found
eight
dollars
in
silver
sewed
up
in
the
lining
of
an
old
blanket
overcoat
jim
said
he
reckoned
the
people
in
that
house
stole
the
coat
because
if
they
a
knowed
the
money
was
there
they
would
a
left
it
i
said
i
reckoned
they
killed
him
too
but
jim
did
want
to
talk
about
that
i
says
now
you
think
it
bad
luck
but
what
did
you
say
when
i
fetched
in
the
that
i
found
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
day
before
yesterday
you
said
it
was
the
worst
bad
luck
in
the
world
to
touch
a
with
my
hands
well
here
your
bad
luck
we
raked
in
all
this
truck
and
eight
dollars
besides
i
wish
we
could
have
some
bad
luck
like
this
every
day
jim
never
you
mind
honey
never
you
mind
do
you
git
too
peart
mind
i
tell
you
it
it
did
come
too
it
was
a
tuesday
that
we
had
that
talk
well
after
dinner
friday
we
was
laying
around
in
the
grass
at
the
upper
end
of
the
ridge
and
got
out
of
tobacco
i
went
to
the
cavern
to
get
some
and
found
a
rattlesnake
in
there
i
killed
him
and
curled
him
up
on
the
foot
of
jim
blanket
ever
so
natural
thinking
there
be
some
fun
when
jim
found
him
there
well
by
night
i
forgot
all
about
the
snake
and
when
jim
flung
himself
down
on
the
blanket
while
i
struck
a
light
the
snake
mate
was
there
and
bit
him
he
jumped
up
yelling
and
the
first
thing
the
light
showed
was
the
varmint
curled
up
and
ready
for
another
spring
i
laid
him
out
in
a
second
with
a
stick
and
jim
grabbed
pap
and
begun
to
pour
it
down
he
was
barefooted
and
the
snake
bit
him
right
on
the
heel
that
all
comes
of
my
being
such
a
fool
as
to
not
remember
that
wherever
you
leave
a
dead
snake
its
mate
always
comes
there
and
curls
around
it
jim
told
me
to
chop
off
the
snake
head
and
throw
it
away
and
then
skin
the
body
and
roast
a
piece
of
it
i
done
it
and
he
eat
it
and
said
it
would
help
cure
him
he
made
me
take
off
the
rattles
and
tie
them
around
his
wrist
too
he
said
that
that
would
help
then
i
slid
out
quiet
and
throwed
the
snakes
clear
away
amongst
the
bushes
for
i
war
going
to
let
jim
find
out
it
was
all
my
fault
not
if
i
could
help
it
jim
sucked
and
sucked
at
the
jug
and
now
and
then
he
got
out
of
his
head
and
pitched
around
and
yelled
but
every
time
he
come
to
himself
he
went
to
sucking
at
the
jug
again
his
foot
swelled
up
pretty
big
and
so
did
his
leg
but
by
and
by
the
drunk
begun
to
come
and
so
i
judged
he
was
all
right
but
i
druther
been
bit
with
a
snake
than
pap
whisky
jim
was
laid
up
for
four
days
and
nights
then
the
swelling
was
all
gone
and
he
was
around
again
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
ever
take
of
a
again
with
my
hands
now
that
i
see
what
had
come
of
it
jim
said
he
reckoned
i
would
believe
him
next
time
and
he
said
that
handling
a
was
such
awful
bad
luck
that
maybe
we
had
got
to
the
end
of
it
yet
he
said
he
druther
see
the
new
moon
over
his
left
shoulder
as
much
as
a
thousand
times
than
take
up
a
in
his
hand
well
i
was
getting
to
feel
that
way
myself
though
i
always
reckoned
that
looking
at
the
new
moon
over
your
left
shoulder
is
one
of
the
carelessest
and
foolishest
things
a
body
can
do
old
hank
bunker
done
it
once
and
bragged
about
it
and
in
less
than
two
years
he
got
drunk
and
fell
off
of
the
and
spread
himself
out
so
that
he
was
just
a
kind
of
a
layer
as
you
may
say
and
they
slid
him
edgeways
between
two
barn
doors
for
a
coffin
and
buried
him
so
so
they
say
but
i
did
see
it
pap
told
me
but
anyway
it
all
come
of
looking
at
the
moon
that
way
like
a
fool
well
the
days
went
along
and
the
river
went
down
between
its
banks
again
and
about
the
first
thing
we
done
was
to
bait
one
of
the
big
hooks
with
a
skinned
rabbit
and
set
it
and
catch
a
catfish
that
was
as
big
as
a
man
being
six
foot
two
inches
long
and
weighed
over
two
hundred
pounds
we
could
handle
him
of
course
he
would
a
flung
us
into
illinois
we
just
set
there
and
watched
him
rip
and
tear
around
till
he
drownded
we
found
a
brass
button
in
his
stomach
and
a
round
ball
and
lots
of
rubbage
we
split
the
ball
open
with
the
hatchet
and
there
was
a
spool
in
it
jim
said
he
had
it
there
a
long
time
to
coat
it
over
so
and
make
a
ball
of
it
it
was
as
big
a
fish
as
was
ever
catched
in
the
mississippi
i
reckon
jim
said
he
had
ever
seen
a
bigger
one
he
would
a
been
worth
a
good
deal
over
at
the
village
they
peddle
out
such
a
fish
as
that
by
the
pound
in
the
there
everybody
buys
some
of
him
his
meat
as
white
as
snow
and
makes
a
good
fry
next
morning
i
said
it
was
getting
slow
and
dull
and
i
wanted
to
get
a
stirring
up
some
way
i
said
i
reckoned
i
would
slip
over
the
river
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
jim
liked
that
notion
but
he
said
i
must
go
in
the
dark
and
look
sharp
then
he
studied
it
over
and
said
could
i
put
on
some
of
them
old
things
and
dress
up
like
a
girl
that
was
a
good
notion
too
so
we
shortened
up
one
of
the
calico
gowns
and
i
turned
up
my
to
my
knees
and
got
into
it
jim
hitched
it
behind
with
the
hooks
and
it
was
a
fair
fit
i
put
on
the
and
tied
it
under
my
chin
and
then
for
a
body
to
look
in
and
see
my
face
was
like
looking
down
a
joint
of
jim
said
nobody
would
know
me
even
in
the
daytime
hardly
i
practiced
around
all
day
to
get
the
hang
of
the
things
and
by
and
by
i
could
do
pretty
well
in
them
only
jim
said
i
did
walk
like
a
girl
and
he
said
i
must
quit
pulling
up
my
gown
to
get
at
my
i
took
notice
and
done
better
i
started
up
the
illinois
shore
in
the
canoe
just
after
dark
i
started
across
to
the
town
from
a
little
below
the
and
the
drift
of
the
current
fetched
me
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
i
tied
up
and
started
along
the
bank
there
was
a
light
burning
in
a
little
shanty
that
had
been
lived
in
for
a
long
time
and
i
wondered
who
had
took
up
quarters
there
i
slipped
up
and
peeped
in
at
the
window
there
was
a
woman
about
forty
year
old
in
there
knitting
by
a
candle
that
was
on
a
pine
table
i
did
know
her
face
she
was
a
stranger
for
you
could
start
a
face
in
that
town
that
i
did
know
now
this
was
lucky
because
i
was
weakening
i
was
getting
afraid
i
had
come
people
might
know
my
voice
and
find
me
out
but
if
this
woman
had
been
in
such
a
little
town
two
days
she
could
tell
me
all
i
wanted
to
know
so
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
made
up
my
mind
i
would
forget
i
was
a
girl
